WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.587
Hey!

00:03.587 --> 00:05.297
You want to go grab
some breakfast?

00:05.297 --> 00:08.300
You haven't left the house
in five days.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.968
You're gonna run into Ava
and Flash at some point, so‐‐

00:09.968 --> 00:11.887
Might as well
just get it over with.

00:11.887 --> 00:15.599
Girls, I am on a major
songwriting roll right now.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.809
Yeah, or you're just trying
to decide which angle to take.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.269
You know which angle
I'm playing right now?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.687
For the first time in my life,

00:20.687 --> 00:22.314
I am the cool, calm,
collected good guy,

00:22.314 --> 00:24.441
and they are the bad guys, okay?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.068
And I can't guarantee
I won't snap.

00:26.068 --> 00:29.112
So please let me enjoy
my position of superiority

00:29.112 --> 00:31.156
for at least a couple more days.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.325
We lucked out that we didn't
have any gigs or rehearsals

00:33.325 --> 00:34.993
until next week,
but we're gonna have to see them

00:34.993 --> 00:36.828
‐Friday night.
‐For the "Feast" preview?

00:36.828 --> 00:39.039
No way, they're definitely
gonna be there. Forget it.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.541
GIGI: You're not going
because of them?

00:40.541 --> 00:41.875
You have to go.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.293
Noah said
he's too nervous to go.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.378
I promised Bam and Re
the three of us would go

00:44.378 --> 00:45.963
and give notes.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.714
Honey, no, I don't want
to lose my cool.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.008
Right now, I'm your cool,
rockin' daddy, remember?

00:50.008 --> 00:52.886
We're going,
with or without you.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.888
What are you‐‐
what are you guys up to now?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.933
What, are you,
like, a couple again?

00:57.933 --> 00:59.559
‐We're, um...
‐We're...

00:59.559 --> 01:03.522
‐Reexamining our situation.
‐What does that mean?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.315
It means that we're
just chillin' out

01:05.315 --> 01:07.359
‐and enjoying ourselves.
‐Mm‐hmm.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.652
Hey, you remember
this ring I got her?

01:08.652 --> 01:09.987
‐Which I love?
‐Yeah.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.364
Turns out
it's a magic ring.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.783
Oh, really?
What's magic about it?

01:14.783 --> 01:17.744
It made Flash disappear.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.622
Can it make him move back
to Nashville sans Ava?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.291
Dad,
you need to stop obsessing

01:22.291 --> 01:23.500
over running into them.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.043
You need to run
into someone new.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.336
Yeah.
Get back in the game.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.713
Oh, my God.
"Get back in the game."

01:27.713 --> 01:29.006
You know,
the only game I ever had

01:29.006 --> 01:30.424
was being on stage.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.676
All right, so what game
am I gonna play now?

01:32.676 --> 01:35.887
"Hey, I'm a 51‐year‐old failed
rock star who likes to drink

01:35.887 --> 01:37.681
"and whose longtime girlfriend
just broke his heart.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.808
Want to come to my daughter's
apartment and [...]?"

01:39.808 --> 01:42.311
I know all kinds of chicks
who'd respond to that challenge.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.770
I know
this really hot 26‐year‐old

01:43.770 --> 01:44.938
who wants to date older guys.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.106
She's sick of guys our age

01:46.106 --> 01:48.108
and all their insecure
ego bullshit.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.154
So she wants to date an old
guy with insecure ego bullshit?

01:52.154 --> 01:55.032
You'd have to kind of
not be yourself.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.034
Who else am I gonna be, guys?
Come on.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.870
A strong,
confident middle‐aged man

01:59.870 --> 02:03.206
with major songwriting talent
and a great head of hair.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.541
I do have
a great head of hair.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.168
Yes, you do,
and, luckily for you,

02:06.168 --> 02:07.836
the shag's making a comeback.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.130
‐But this ain't a shag.
‐Seriously?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.757
Come on, you are
the blond version

02:11.757 --> 02:13.842
of Jane Fonda in "Klute."
If she had balls.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.719
The '70s are making
a big comeback, Dad.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.262
Everybody has a shag‐‐
Taylor Swift.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.639
Chloe Sevigny.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.140
Think of yourself
as Chloe Sevigny.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.058
With a dick.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.851
JOHNNY: That's great.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.603
Jane Fonda's balls
and Chloe Sevigny's cock.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.439
Thanks for putting those images
in my mental masturbation files.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.940
‐Ew.
JOHNNY: Exactly.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.734
How about this image?

02:30.734 --> 02:33.779
You, out on the town, with a hot
26‐year‐old babe on your arm.

02:33.779 --> 02:36.198
She's got amazing tits.
An ass to die for.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.991
Legs that go on for days.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.409
‐That would be awesome.
‐Yeah.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.745
And it would make Ava
insanely jealous.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.746
No, no, no.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.914
You do not want to run into Ava

02:43.914 --> 02:44.915
when you're with another girl.

02:44.915 --> 02:45.916
You can't handle that.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.250
It's not a good idea.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.377
We're not talking
another girl.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.586
We're talking a 26‐year‐old girl

02:49.586 --> 02:51.129
with amazing tits
and a great ass.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.756
I would make her jealous
and probably really horny.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.466
Is this chick into threesomes?

This whole method acting thing

03:24.746 --> 03:26.832
I mean, it's been two
goddamn weeks.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.000
The entire cast and crew
is starving to death.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.586
Just like the Irish did
back in the famine.

03:31.586 --> 03:35.674
You see, Campbell, he wants us
to feel that same exact energy

03:35.674 --> 03:37.342
they did back in 1847.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.804
Only eating the foods
they had to survive.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.223
He wants the whole production
to feel that‐‐

03:43.223 --> 03:45.684
that‐‐that hunger and yearning.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.935
Just till
the end of show tonight,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.478
so relax, man.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.064
Here.
Have some tree bark.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.275
I'm sick of tree bark.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.360
I want a Snickers bar.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.029
I want a steak
the size of my head.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.032
Campbell's got his guys,
like, checking on everybody,

04:01.032 --> 04:03.326
like some kind
of Guinness Gestapo.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.744
You see that dancer
the other day?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.288
She got caught eating a peach.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.081
They confiscated it from her.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.375
Peaches don't grow
in Ireland, bro.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.085
How are you doing this,
by the way?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.712
You of all people.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.297
‐Huh?
‐What the hell's that mean?

04:15.297 --> 04:16.298
‐ You know what it means.

04:16.298 --> 04:17.299
I bet you any money.

04:17.299 --> 04:18.341
(sniffing)

04:18.341 --> 04:19.593
What are you‐‐
what are‐‐

04:19.593 --> 04:21.511
‐Don't‐‐
‐ You have got to have

04:21.511 --> 04:24.264
something edible stashed away

04:24.264 --> 04:25.307
someplace.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.308
It's called discipline.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.309
Devotion to a cause.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.560
Go ahead, check.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.853
Check the cabinet.
Check my bag.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.146
‐Look in my bag.
‐Okay, I'm gonna.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.023
Maybe if
you dedicated yourself

04:33.023 --> 04:34.357
to the rich history at hand,

04:34.357 --> 04:36.193
it'd be easier to fast,
my friend.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.320
Hey,
you listen to me.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.156
Dude, you have been
with me 24/7.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.574
Every waking moment.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.993
You know all I have had
to eat for two weeks

04:44.993 --> 04:47.454
is that crazy famine crap,
but enough is enough.

04:47.454 --> 04:51.750
Dude, I am a starving
New York Jew in 2016.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.669
I'm not skinny Druid
[...] from 1847.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.087
What is that?

04:56.087 --> 04:57.088
Nothing!
Get out of my...

04:57.088 --> 04:58.089
Huh?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.299
What is it?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.802
A bag of Raisinets?
(chuckles)

05:01.802 --> 05:03.720
I knew it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.138
‐Yeah.
‐Food, food, I love you.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.556
They're
dried elderberries, dude.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.058
Watch your teeth on those.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.560
I chipped a molar this morning.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.522
O ye,
of waning faith and willpower.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.523
Oh.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.483
Hey, Campbell.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.026
Listen.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.153
‐Can we order a pizza?
‐Campbell?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.696
I know not this Campbell
you speak of.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.448
I am Taryn,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.242
leader of the Irish
rebel uprising.

05:25.242 --> 05:26.284
Right,
I forgot.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.245
‐Grass.
‐Listen... Taryn.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.205
Can you get a message
to Campbell?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.916
Will you be talking to him
later this evening?

05:34.626 --> 05:36.628
Well, that's a fine question.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.588
Here's my answer:

05:38.588 --> 05:40.799
not until my people overcome

05:40.799 --> 05:43.426
the tyranny
of their British oppressors.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.471
So probably around 11:00 p. m.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.557
Well, maybe, then,
you could ask Campbell

05:48.557 --> 05:53.353
to order us a large
pepperoni pie at 11:01 p. m.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.604
Right?

05:54.604 --> 05:57.524
(laughter)

05:59.776 --> 06:01.403
Flesh is weak.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.572
The stomach is weaker.

06:03.572 --> 06:07.325
The soul, boyos,
the Irish soul...

06:08.577 --> 06:09.953
Wrought with iron.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.622
Keep that in mind.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.960
Sweet Jesus.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.045
Watch this one with the hat.
I don't trust him.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.964
Keep an eye on him, will you?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.345
He's not gonna order
the pizza.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.268
(indistinct chatter)

06:33.268 --> 06:34.769
Wow.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.605
Pretty awesome, huh?

06:36.605 --> 06:37.898
So tell Johnny
about your band.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.649
Oh, well,

06:39.649 --> 06:41.234
we're not really a band,
we're more like a collective.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.235
Oh.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.361
Collective.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.779
‐That's cool.
‐Yeah.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.531
It's me and my cousins,
Edith and Hortense,

06:46.531 --> 06:48.950
and my sister, Genevieve,
and my brother, Norah.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.119
We all live together,
and our instruments are from

06:51.119 --> 06:53.038
‐the pre‐Raphaelite era.
‐Wow.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.914
When is that,
is that, like, the '60s?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.666
The late 1860s.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.544
We have two lutes,
a fife, a clavichord,

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
and a chitarrone.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.422
Wow, I actually
had a chitarrone

07:02.422 --> 07:05.216
in Mexico once,
and it was [...] delicious.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.676
You're so funny.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.804
No, it's an ancient
oversized Italian guitar.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.098
Basically if an archlute
and a theorbo had a baby,

07:12.098 --> 07:13.099
it'd be called a chitarrone.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.018
You should jam with us sometime.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.019
I‐‐yeah.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.312
Yes, we'd love to.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.730
He's actually
an archlute fanatic.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.689
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.149
‐Kinda.
‐Oh, my gosh.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.276
And don't even get him started
on the fife.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.611
We should
see her play sometime.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.945
I definitely
want to see you play.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.447
‐Really?
‐Yeah.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.782
That's great,

07:28.782 --> 07:29.991
we're at the New Jersey
Renaissance Fair

07:29.991 --> 07:31.159
‐all next weekend.
‐Oh.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.786
You have to come
in period costume,

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
but I probably
have a peasant jerkin

07:34.454 --> 07:36.665
and some tights
that might fit you.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.625
That's great.
We'd love to, I'll drive.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.751
Great.

07:39.751 --> 07:40.752
‐That's awesome.
BOTH: Yeah.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.379
Guess we're going.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.672
What's the name of the band?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.173
Zither Sisters.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.217
‐Cool name.
‐Thank you.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.678
