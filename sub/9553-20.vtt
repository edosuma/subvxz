MARION:
Richard, I wanted you
to get up early this morning

01:28.000 --> 01:30.010
so that I could get
all your dirty clothes.

01:30.010 --> 01:32.510
Well, it's not that late, Mom.
How did you sleep so late?

01:32.510 --> 01:35.010
I want to get
all this work over-- oh!

01:35.010 --> 01:35.960
Look, I know
there's a mess.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.520
I'm sorry, I j-- I just got in
a little late last night.

01:38.520 --> 01:41.020
I noticed.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.020
Did you "find your thrill
on Blueberry Hill"?

01:46.520 --> 01:49.530
Bill, bill,
Occupant, bill.

01:50.030 --> 01:52.030
It seems like all I do
is pick up after you.

01:52.030 --> 01:53.530
Well, I'm picking,
Mom, I'm picking.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.030
I mean, he's not a baby anymore.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.530
He's going to be going
to college.

01:56.530 --> 01:59.540
He's a man.
Now he is.

01:59.540 --> 02:00.490
What do you mean?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.370
You've been drafted.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.740
I've been drafted?

02:05.740 --> 02:07.740
He's been drafted?

02:07.740 --> 02:09.000
He can't go.

02:11.410 --> 02:12.500
Dad, will you open that?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
He's just a boy.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.800
He's too young
to go in the Army.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.050
Oh, Marion, look,

02:17.050 --> 02:20.560
this is just a notice to report
for a physical examination.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.010
Now, that doesn't mean
he's drafted.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.430
Yeah, but I-I didn't
plan this.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.430
I mean,
who would plan this?

02:25.430 --> 02:29.430
Oh, Richard, let me
take those things.

02:29.430 --> 02:31.230
Oh, you'll be
going away soon.

02:31.430 --> 02:33.020
Marion, will you take it easy?

02:33.020 --> 02:35.520
We knew this day was going
to come sooner or later.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.020
Now, look, we're not at war.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.530
He'll probably go in
as an officer.

02:40.530 --> 02:43.330
You are planning to continue
ROTC in college, aren't you?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.170
Yeah, I've already taken it
for two years in high school,

02:46.170 --> 02:48.670
but... hey, I'm going
to find Potsie and Ralph

02:49.170 --> 02:51.170
and see if they got
their notices, too.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.170
What's going on?

02:52.170 --> 02:54.170
Oh, Richard just got
his draft notice.

02:54.170 --> 02:55.180
Great.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.510
You'll get
to see the world--

02:56.760 --> 02:58.340
Rome and Paris.

02:58.340 --> 03:00.210
Maybe you'll even get
to see Bob Hope.

03:00.510 --> 03:03.020
Bob Hope can sit on it.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.440
I'll be
all right.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Don't worry
about it.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.940
Be careful, dear.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.980
Hey, hey, guys, I've been
looking all over for you.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.480
I just got my
notice here

03:19.480 --> 03:20.870
to take my physical
for the draft.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.570
The line forms
to the right.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.950
Oh, good,
I'm glad I'm not alone.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.820
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry
that they got you guys,

03:27.120 --> 03:28.210
but it's just that
I didn't want to--

03:28.210 --> 03:29.710
I'm just going to
get in line here.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.710
(chuckles)

03:31.710 --> 03:33.210
My dad doesn't
want me to go.

03:33.210 --> 03:36.720
He says war is bad
for my sense of humor.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.220
My dad's trying to rent my room.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.590
I don't want to
go to Guadalcanal.

03:45.590 --> 03:47.680
Ralph, they're not going
to send you to Guadalcanal.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.100
We won that battle.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.680
Oh, yeah.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.180
I'll go there.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
I like occupied islands.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.900
They play volleyball.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.990
They meet you at the beach
and they dive for coins.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.080
Who just slammed that door?

04:04.080 --> 04:06.030
Who just slammed that door
in my ears?

04:06.030 --> 04:09.120
No, Fonzie,
strong wind today.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.120
Really, it was just the wind.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.120
Yeah, right,
just the wind.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
Now, listen
up, all right?

04:15.120 --> 04:18.170
Kim Butkus is coming, coming
by to pick up her car.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.260
I haven't finished it yet.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.300
So will you please take
your soap opera somewhere else?

04:22.300 --> 04:24.380
Wait a minute, this
is not a soap opera.

04:24.880 --> 04:25.770
This is life.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.300
Your life is a soap opera.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.640
Listen, the Army's going
to be good for you.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.020
Make men out of you...
most of you.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.940
Hey, Fonz,
why didn't they call on you?

04:37.940 --> 04:39.030
Are you
kidding, Pots?

04:39.030 --> 04:40.530
The Fonz is our
secret weapon.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.030
Heyyy.

04:47.540 --> 04:50.040
Richard, eat your pancakes.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.410
Your eggs and bacon
will be ready in a minute.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.990
It's hard to eat
at 5:30 in the morning.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.910
It's still dark outside.

04:56.910 --> 04:58.500
Well, I want you
to have a big breakfast

04:58.500 --> 05:01.080
because you'll need energy
for your physical.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.170
It doesn't take
that much energy

05:02.170 --> 05:04.170
to walk around
in your underwear.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.170
Bye, everybody,
I'm off to work.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.560
(birds chirping)

05:10.930 --> 05:13.930
Marion, look at this.

05:14.430 --> 05:15.430
Get the camera quick.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.480
We got a total eclipse.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.570
Oh, no, Howard,

05:19.570 --> 05:22.070
it's 5:30
in the morning, dear.

05:22.070 --> 05:24.070
I set your alarm clock ahead

05:24.070 --> 05:26.530
so that you could get up
and say good-bye to Richard.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.110
I'm sorry.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.620
Have a nice physical, Richard.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.120
That wasn't
an eclipse?

05:40.120 --> 05:41.620
No.

05:41.620 --> 05:42.630
You'll wake me
when we have one?

05:42.630 --> 05:44.630
Yes.

05:44.630 --> 05:47.130
Dad, Dad, w-why don't you
at least eat some pancakes

05:47.130 --> 05:48.130
with me while
you're up?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.600
Well, okay,
if there's plenty

05:50.600 --> 05:51.680
of maple syrup.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.690
MARION:
Plenty, dear.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.690
Doesn't anybody sleep
around this place?

05:54.690 --> 05:56.690
We're all up to
see Richard off.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.690
I made his
favorite breakfast.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.310
(chuckling):
C rations?

06:00.310 --> 06:02.400
Boy, I tell you,
I remember in the Army

06:02.400 --> 06:04.900
when I had to get up
at 5:30 in the morning.

06:04.900 --> 06:05.900
Oh, Howard, please.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.320
War stories are
always so gruesome.

06:08.650 --> 06:11.040
What's gruesome about K.P.?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.580
Well, I'm gonna have
to get going now.

06:17.790 --> 06:20.380
I'll see you later.
Oh, Richard.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.300
Is it time
already?

06:21.660 --> 06:24.250
Well, I'm going
back to bed.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.220
This looks like it's going
to be real tearjerker.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.250
Bye, Rich.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.760
Don't forget my kimono.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.090
Have a nice life.

06:31.340 --> 06:33.430
(knocking)

06:33.430 --> 06:34.730
Oh, they've
come for you.

06:36.010 --> 06:37.810
I could hide him in the attic.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.100
It's all right, Mom, it's fine.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.070
Greetings.
Yeah, hi, guys.
Rich, Mr. C.

06:42.070 --> 06:43.100
Hi.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
Well, thanks
for the breakfast.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.110
We got to get going now.
Well, wait, now,

06:46.110 --> 06:48.110
Ralph and Potsie might
like some breakfast.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.610
Yeah, yeah.
Good idea, okay.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.110
Mom, we don't have
time for this.

06:52.110 --> 06:53.110
We'll take it
along with us.

06:53.110 --> 06:54.610
Come on.
Right, Pots.
Hi, Howie.

06:54.610 --> 06:58.120
Richard.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.090
Here's your lunch
for the physical.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.340
Now, did you put on
your clean... underwear?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.510
(both laughing)

07:05.790 --> 07:08.880
Well, did you, Rich?

07:08.880 --> 07:11.800
Yeah, I put on my
ROTC underwear.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.380
Come on, we got to
be there at 0700.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.390
I'll return the maple syrup.

07:16.390 --> 07:19.390
Well, we're off to the Army.

07:19.390 --> 07:20.390
Don't worry, Mr. C.

07:20.390 --> 07:21.890
I'll take good care
of him for you.

07:21.890 --> 07:23.890
(groans)

07:25.000 --> 07:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:43.210 --> 07:46.720
Okay, everybody,
group "B" in here.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.220
Move it, move it,
move it, move it,

07:48.220 --> 07:49.550
move it,
move it, move it, move it,

07:49.800 --> 07:50.390
move it.

07:50.890 --> 07:52.890
Wait a second,
I said group "B".

07:52.890 --> 07:54.390
That says "C."

07:54.390 --> 07:57.890
What are you, some kind of
college graduate or something?

07:57.890 --> 08:00.400
Out, out!

08:01.900 --> 08:04.350
I hate college
graduates.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.350
All right, men.

08:07.350 --> 08:10.360
My name is
Sergeant Betchler.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.360
Hmm?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.780
And that's the way I
like it pronounced--

08:16.110 --> 08:18.200
Betchler.

08:18.200 --> 08:22.700
All right, before we start
anything, what is that smell?

08:29.180 --> 08:31.590
Well, uh, that-that's my lunch.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.510
My mother made it
for me.

08:34.929 --> 08:38.020
I-It's a sardine sandwich.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.020
It's my favorite kind.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.520
Oh, it's your favorite, huh?

08:41.940 --> 08:44.020
I-I-I'll find some place
to put it.

08:44.020 --> 08:46.030
Yeah, I
hope you do.

08:46.030 --> 08:48.530
Oh.

08:48.530 --> 08:50.530
Ah, not under Ike.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.530
Oh.

08:53.530 --> 08:54.530
Eh...

08:54.530 --> 08:57.040
Oh, yeah, no, no,
not under the flag.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.540
That's right, let me help you,
let me help you.

09:03.040 --> 09:07.050
Oh, good, you found
a place for it.

09:07.050 --> 09:09.050
I think it's a real,
a real nice place, too, I...

09:09.050 --> 09:11.050
Sit down.
Right.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.550
All right,
where was I?

09:12.550 --> 09:14.550
Oh, yeah,
before we start,

09:14.550 --> 09:15.560
are there
any notes

09:15.560 --> 09:19.060
from doctors,
clergymen, or employers?

09:19.060 --> 09:20.430
All right, front
and center.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.840
You've got a note,
don't you, Ralph?

09:21.840 --> 09:24.350
Yeah, you know, my
dad's an optometrist.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.850
This note says
I'm legally blind.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.270
He even wanted me
to bring a dog.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.190
All right, so
your doctor thinks

09:31.190 --> 09:33.690
you're too short to
be in the Army, huh?

09:33.690 --> 09:35.690
Corporal.

09:35.690 --> 09:39.700
Take this man outside and
put two inches on him.

09:39.700 --> 09:43.200
I measure
lumps.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.040
Okay, anybody
else with a note?

09:46.290 --> 09:48.670
Uh, Ralph has one.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.460
Red has a note.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.460
(mumbling)

10:00.270 --> 10:03.850
Yeah... good.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.860
No more notes.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.360
Good fake, Ralph.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.230
What fake?

10:11.530 --> 10:14.610
All right, when I call your
name, I want you to answer up.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.450
Weber.
Up!

10:18.870 --> 10:20.870
All right, wise guy,
give me five push-ups.

10:21.290 --> 10:23.460
But you said answer "up."
Make it ten.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.460
Cunningham.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.960
Here.

10:28.960 --> 10:29.960
Dockerelli.

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
Here.

10:30.960 --> 10:35.470
Fonzarelli...
Fonzarelli.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.610
You're a little late,
aren't you, "Funichelli"?

10:57.610 --> 10:58.610
I'm really sorry.

10:58.610 --> 11:01.030
It was my fault,
Sergeant, uh, "Belcher."

11:01.360 --> 11:03.950
(laughter)

11:06.450 --> 11:08.370
That's Sergeant Betchler.

11:08.670 --> 11:09.620
Whatever.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.460
You see,
I should have known better

11:12.460 --> 11:15.460
than to, to date the Aloha
Pussycats on a weeknight.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.460
(laughter)

11:16.460 --> 11:17.460
All right,
knock it off.

11:17.460 --> 11:18.460
Fall in.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.960
Yeah, listen,
we got to hurry this up.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.460
I got to be
out of here by noon.

11:21.960 --> 11:22.470
Oh, is that so?

11:22.880 --> 11:23.970
Yeah, yeah,
I got a date.

11:23.970 --> 11:25.470
Oh, a date.
Isn't that nice?

11:25.970 --> 11:26.970
Let me tell you
something.

11:26.970 --> 11:27.970
Your dates might be nice.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.440
I got a date
with the Hooper triplets.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.470
(indistinct chatter)

11:31.470 --> 11:32.480
All right,
knock it off.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.480
Sit over there,
lover boy.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.240
I can't wait
till we cut your hair.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.070
ALL:
Oh...

11:48.960 --> 11:51.460
All right, we're going
to fill out some forms now.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.830
Last name first
and your first name last,

11:54.210 --> 11:55.300
middle initial.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.800
Nobody writes until
I tell them to write.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.800
Fonz, what are you doing here?

12:00.800 --> 12:04.810
I got a personal invitation
from Uncle Sam.

12:04.810 --> 12:06.230
Fonzie, why didn't
you tell us about it?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.640
Well, you know
what happened

12:07.640 --> 12:10.150
when they tried
to induct Elvis into the Army.

12:10.150 --> 12:11.650
Oh, yeah, a bunch
of girls went crazy

12:11.650 --> 12:13.650
and tore down the
induction center.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.100
Exactamundo.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.570
Now, who told you
to start writing?

12:19.570 --> 12:21.940
I thought of it
all on my own.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.330
(laughter)

12:23.330 --> 12:24.830
All right, knock it off.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.330
You know, Fonzarelli,

12:26.330 --> 12:30.620
I'd like to get you alone in
a room for about five minutes.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.840
Sarge, I didn't think
you were that kind of guy.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.290
All right, knock it off!

12:41.790 --> 12:43.300
Knock it off!

12:45.300 --> 12:48.300
You know, when you go to the
barber, I'm gonna go with you--

12:48.680 --> 12:50.270
to supervise the...

12:50.270 --> 12:52.270
(mimicking clippers)

12:53.770 --> 12:55.780
Maybe when he's finished
with my hair,

12:55.780 --> 12:58.560
he'll do my nails.

12:58.780 --> 12:59.860
RALPH:
Good, Fonz.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.870
Fonz, Fonz, you just
better be careful,

13:02.870 --> 13:04.870
'cause this guy
is mean.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.870
He just sent out a
short kid to grow.

13:08.790 --> 13:11.320
Okay, uh, Sergeant
Betchler says,

13:11.740 --> 13:13.330
write your names.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.330
Good.

13:15.830 --> 13:16.830
Okay, anybody here

13:17.330 --> 13:18.830
have prior military
experience?

13:19.330 --> 13:20.330
(softly clears throat)

13:20.830 --> 13:21.830
Sgt. Betchler...

13:22.250 --> 13:24.340
Hey, you said that nice.

13:24.340 --> 13:25.170
Say it again.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.840
Betchler.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.590
You're gonna get your lunch
back.

13:31.090 --> 13:32.600
I had ROTC in high school.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.600
Oh, you want to
be an officer.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.480
Yeah, I-I would.

13:35.760 --> 13:36.850
Ah, good. You're--

13:36.850 --> 13:38.350
Well, you're in charge,
Cunningham.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.850
Very good.

13:39.850 --> 13:41.690
Anybody steps out of
line, I come to you.

13:41.990 --> 13:42.860
Yes, sir.

13:43.070 --> 13:44.660
No, no, don't
call me "sir".

13:45.160 --> 13:47.660
Only officers
are called sir.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.160
I'm a non-com.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.660
I could have been
a "sir".

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
Should have
been a "sir".

13:52.580 --> 13:54.670
Could have been
a "sir".

13:55.170 --> 13:56.670
Would have been
a-a good "sir".

14:04.380 --> 14:06.880
I'm better than
all those guys.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.180
And you're all gonna
listen to me,

14:09.350 --> 14:11.930
including you, Fonzarelli,
because I don't like you.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.440
You see all these
hash marks?

14:13.440 --> 14:15.220
I'm a 20-year man.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.390
I been a man all my life.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.230
(guys laugh)

14:24.730 --> 14:27.730
You know I supervised
Elvis's haircut,

14:28.230 --> 14:30.240
and yours is gonna
be shorter.

14:30.650 --> 14:33.570
GUYS:
Ooh!

14:33.870 --> 14:35.960
Now, I guess you guys
are smart enough

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
to have finished
your names by now.

14:37.960 --> 14:38.960
Uh, excuse me.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.460
Was that the last name first
or first name last?

14:41.460 --> 14:42.460
Ten push-ups.

14:42.460 --> 14:44.470
(laughs)

14:44.470 --> 14:46.470
Ah, you want
to giggle, huh?

14:46.470 --> 14:48.470
Give me ten.

14:50.470 --> 14:52.470
You know, you're a nice kid,
Cunningham.

14:52.470 --> 14:54.260
Say my name again.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.930
Sergeant Belcher.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.850
(guys cheer and laugh)

15:00.350 --> 15:01.850
All right, give me ten!

15:08.820 --> 15:10.830
(cheering)

15:16.330 --> 15:18.330
All right, line up.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.880
Hey, Corporal,
get a load of this.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.350
ROTC,

15:36.350 --> 15:39.140
little duckies
and a big ant.

15:40.470 --> 15:42.980
These guys are here
to entertain us.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.980
Hey, uh, where's
Fonzarelli?

15:45.980 --> 15:48.730
Hey, Cunningham, is this
any way to run an outfit?

15:48.950 --> 15:51.980
Uh, Fonz,
come on out, okay?

16:07.470 --> 16:09.470
Are you afraid

16:09.470 --> 16:12.470
somebody's gonna steal
your little jacket?

16:12.470 --> 16:14.470
No.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.480
I was afraid maybe
I'd get caught in a draft.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
(guys laugh)

16:19.480 --> 16:20.980
All right,
knock it off.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.980
You think
that's funny?
Yeah.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.980
Hey, here's something
that's funny.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.990
All people wearing
jackets

16:25.990 --> 16:28.990
at the end
of the line.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.360
I said the end
of the line.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.750
This is the end
of the line.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.110
The front end.

16:39.370 --> 16:40.950
All right.

16:41.450 --> 16:42.450
Blood tests.

16:42.450 --> 16:43.450
Everybody, line up.

16:43.450 --> 16:44.920
Everybody has to give
a blood sample.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.870
Rich, no one told me

16:46.870 --> 16:49.380
I was suppose to bring
a blood sample.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.880
Potsie, they're gonna take it
out of your finger.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.880
And it's gonna
hurt real bad.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.380
I can't stand pain.
I'm leaving.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.380
Hey, Ralph,
I'm gonna help you.

16:57.380 --> 16:58.880
Get up there.
Thanks, Fonz.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.390
You're gonna be
just fine.
Thanks.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.190
All right.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.109
Hey, guys, what do
you know about that?

17:05.109 --> 17:06.030
I didn't feel a thing.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.480
(screaming)

17:08.480 --> 17:10.280
Okay, he'll be fine.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.819
Hey, Fonz, you missed
the blood test.

17:16.319 --> 17:17.819
GUYS:
Ooh!

17:30.420 --> 17:32.800
Can I do him?

17:37.170 --> 17:39.010
Okay, Weber,

17:39.220 --> 17:41.810
maybe next time you won't try
to fill up all the bottles.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.110
All right, talking
about bottles,

17:56.110 --> 17:58.110
I'm gonna leave you
for a few minutes.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.110
Now, when I'm gone,

18:00.610 --> 18:02.610
I know some of you guys
are gonna miss me.

18:02.610 --> 18:04.620
(overlapping chatter)

18:04.620 --> 18:07.120
When I'm gone, Lt. Quinlan's
gonna be in charge

18:07.120 --> 18:09.120
of the next phase.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.620
While I'm away,

18:10.620 --> 18:12.960
ROTC will take over.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.790
Watch it, watch it,
watch it, watch it.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.800
(door opens)

18:16.800 --> 18:17.800
POTSIE:
All right.

18:19.770 --> 18:22.770
Good morning, men.

18:22.770 --> 18:25.270
Hey, it's a
Lieutenant woman.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.270
ALL:
Good morning, Lieutenant.

18:28.270 --> 18:31.280
I'm Richard Cunningham,
ROTC.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.280
I-I'm kind of
in charge here.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.230
I'm sorry that I'm
in my underwear.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.150
Well, don't worry.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.150
Uh, like they say in
the Medical Corps,

18:40.150 --> 18:42.150
if I see anything I
haven't seen before,

18:42.150 --> 18:44.160
I'll shoot it.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.460
All right,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.250
now each of you is
gonna run up

18:50.250 --> 18:51.750
and down these
stairs briskly.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.750
Like this.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.250
Then you'll be checked
for pulse and heartbeat.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.250
Uh... Fonzarelli.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.260
Yo.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.260
Go over these steps

19:03.260 --> 19:05.260
and I want you
to touch each step.

19:18.770 --> 19:20.690
Cute, Fonzarelli.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.860
It's, uh,

19:23.860 --> 19:25.610
hard to do this
through leather.

19:25.610 --> 19:27.620
I'll take it
off for you.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.120
Now hear this,
now hear this.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.870
All nurses fall out
for night maneuvers.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.680
Turn around.
Yeah.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.770
Could you move that
up a little bit?

19:44.770 --> 19:47.770
A little over
to the left.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.770
Aaayyh!

19:49.770 --> 19:52.770
Ahhhh.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.730
You're one of the healthiest
men I've ever met.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.730
You ain't whistli''
Dixie, Jack.

20:04.240 --> 20:07.240
Listen, you and me
together, soon,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.160
and that is an order.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.080
I've been trained
to follow orders.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.330
Next.

20:18.630 --> 20:21.640
Uh... uh, Malph.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.650
Atten-hut!

20:33.150 --> 20:34.650
What do you think
this is?

20:35.150 --> 20:36.150
Get that ant
in gear

20:36.150 --> 20:37.650
and move it
over the hill!

20:37.650 --> 20:39.150
Move it!

20:39.150 --> 20:40.660
Everything works
for him.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.160
Move it! Hut-two.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.690
You'll be notified

20:44.690 --> 20:46.500
as to your proper

20:46.500 --> 20:48.330
classification...

20:48.330 --> 20:49.250
When?

20:49.250 --> 20:51.670
Uh, no-no interruptions.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.670
Now I gotta do the whole thing
over again.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.090
You'll be notified

20:58.090 --> 21:01.090
as to your proper classification

21:01.090 --> 21:04.100
resulting from today's physical.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.600
I look forward

21:05.600 --> 21:08.100
to seeing all you guys
again real soon.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.100
I hope not too soon.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.100
You want to eat some
more paper, Red?

21:12.100 --> 21:14.110
I'm full.

21:14.110 --> 21:15.110
Good.

21:15.110 --> 21:17.610
All right, everybody
from ROTC down,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.110
dismissed.

21:19.110 --> 21:20.610
All right, move,
move, move!

21:20.610 --> 21:22.610
Oh, uh, Khaki
Drawers,

21:22.610 --> 21:25.620
here's your lunch.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.620
Hey, wait a minute.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.960
My Twinkies are
missing.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.080
Spoils of war.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.380
Okay.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.380
He took my Twinkies!
Hey, hey.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.880
MP! Come on over here!
Hey, hey, hey!

21:40.880 --> 21:42.880
He took my Twinkies!
All right,
all right.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.390
Look, here's
a quarter.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.890
Buy yourself some
new Twinkies.

21:45.890 --> 21:47.390
All right, Rich!
All right!

21:47.390 --> 21:50.390
(guys cheering and applauding)

21:50.390 --> 21:51.890
All right, the back row.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.900
Out. Fast. Make it fast.
On the double.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.320
Whoa.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
You probably noticed

22:03.820 --> 22:05.610
that you're the only one
still here.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.410
Well, I ain't surprised.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.360
I had an inkling
I was your favorite.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.280
Looks like you missed
a pretty good date,

22:12.280 --> 22:13.530
huh, Fonzarelli?

22:13.530 --> 22:15.830
Oh, hey, don't worry about it,
non-com,

22:15.830 --> 22:18.170
the army always comes first.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.960
Ah, that's good to hear

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
because it's gonna take
about an hour or two

22:21.960 --> 22:24.960
to fill out these
forms again.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.460
You see, I
couldn't read it.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.260
Maybe-maybe this time
you should print.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.100
Must I?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.600
Yeah.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.600
The last one that didn't
fill out the forms

22:34.600 --> 22:37.610
is scrubbing camels
in the Sahara.

22:37.610 --> 22:39.610
Well, listen, I hate to
disappoint you, Sarge,

22:39.610 --> 22:41.560
but I gotta be
some place else.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.530
Okay, wise guy,

22:43.530 --> 22:45.480
give me ten push-ups.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.460
Seven.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.410
Hey, I never thought
you'd get here!

23:00.410 --> 23:01.960
Sorry I'm late.
At ease.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.250
What's going on here?

23:03.250 --> 23:05.000
Just a little discipline, sir.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Uh, Fonzarelli, uh,
did the forms wrong,

23:07.000 --> 23:08.390
and he has to fill 'em out
again.

23:08.390 --> 23:09.810
That won't do.

23:09.810 --> 23:11.260
I need this man to help me

23:11.260 --> 23:13.180
with some research.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.590
He'll be
in my charge.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.060
You know, Louie, uh,
don't you think

23:16.060 --> 23:18.060
he's a little out
of shape here?

23:20.070 --> 23:22.070
You're right.

23:22.070 --> 23:24.070
Give me ten.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.990
I coulda been an officer.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.360
I shoulda been an officer.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.500
All right, fellas,
what a day for football.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.500
All right.
All right.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.750
Hut! Hey.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.040
POTSIE:
Let's go outside.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.510
We're gonna play some
touch football. Come on.

23:45.510 --> 23:46.510
C'mon, Joanie.
Oh!

23:47.010 --> 23:48.290
As long as you don't play
"dump the center".

23:48.290 --> 23:50.130
Come on, Fonzie,
play quarterback.

23:50.130 --> 23:51.130
All right.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.600
All right, I'll play
quarterback

23:52.600 --> 23:54.100
for both teams.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.050
Aaayyh!

23:56.940 --> 23:58.970
Marion, are you crying?

23:58.970 --> 24:00.970
Oh, Howard,

24:00.970 --> 24:03.310
I just hate
to see them grow up.

24:03.310 --> 24:05.110
What if the Army takes them?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.610
They're all one-A.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.110
Well, then they'll
all apply

24:08.110 --> 24:10.120
for their college
deferments.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
What if there's a war?
What if...

24:12.120 --> 24:14.120
Oh, now come on,
Marion,

24:14.120 --> 24:17.120
I mean the whole world
practically has the bomb.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.120
There are not gonna
be any more wars.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.630
The UN will see
to that.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.630
I think the world has
learned their lesson.

24:23.130 --> 24:25.130
We'll never have to send
our boys to fight again.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.130
Oh, I hope so, Howard.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.130
FONZIE:
All right, hey
Pots, go long.

24:29.580 --> 24:30.640
Go long!
Okay.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.140
RICHIE:
I'll hit the
quarterback!

24:32.140 --> 24:33.640
RALPH:
I'll cover him.
I'll cover him.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
RICHIE:
I'll hit the
quarterback!

24:34.640 --> 24:35.640
FONZIE:
Oh, yeah?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.140
RICHIE:
Oh, oh, kidding, Fonz!

24:37.140 --> 24:39.140
POTSIE:
I got it! I got it!
I got it!

24:39.140 --> 24:41.010
FONZIE:
Wait a minute, it's
going over his head.

24:41.010 --> 24:42.900
RALPH:
Uh-oh.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.900
You kids!

24:44.900 --> 24:46.850
What is the matter with you!

24:46.850 --> 24:48.900
How many times have I told you

24:48.900 --> 24:50.910
not to play so close
to the house!
FONZIE:

24:50.910 --> 24:52.910
