WEBVTT

00:13.481 --> 00:15.733
What the fuck are we doing
in an ice factory?

00:17.068 --> 00:19.321
You expect us to run
our operation out of here?

00:19.404 --> 00:22.240
I expect us
to avoid getting caught.

00:22.324 --> 00:23.866
That means operating
in my territory.

00:23.950 --> 00:26.118
Yeah, why is that exactly?

00:27.454 --> 00:29.539
This place has
everything we'll need

00:29.622 --> 00:31.458
to print, dry, and pack.

00:36.921 --> 00:38.130
We're not doing this.

00:38.923 --> 00:40.007
You made a deal.

00:40.091 --> 00:42.885
I didn't make shit.
He did.

00:42.969 --> 00:44.762
And to be honest, I don't know
what the fuck he was thinking.

00:44.846 --> 00:47.640
He was probably thinking
that he didn't want you to get deported.

00:47.724 --> 00:49.225
Okay, look.

00:49.892 --> 00:52.270
We don't have to like
each other to make this work.

00:54.481 --> 00:57.650
I know she can be an asshole,

00:57.734 --> 00:59.151
but it's the smart play.

01:09.621 --> 01:10.830
What's going on?

01:10.913 --> 01:12.749
We just wanted to see
if you're up and running yet.

01:14.709 --> 01:18.463
I'm still setting up, but I should be
ready to go in a couple hours.

01:23.343 --> 01:24.594
Give us a minute, yeah?

01:36.147 --> 01:40.026
I know Ah Sahm thought this deal
was the only way to go,

01:40.109 --> 01:44.947
but I haven't forgotten that you tried
to dice him and my father.

01:46.241 --> 01:48.075
Things are different now.

01:48.159 --> 01:50.703
We have enough enemies
outside of Chinatown.

01:51.329 --> 01:53.164
I no longer want to be at war
with my own people.

01:53.248 --> 01:54.451
Bullshit.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.293
You want to rule this place.

01:56.376 --> 02:00.087
You've been plotting since the moment
you climbed into Long Zii's bed.

02:00.171 --> 02:01.714
And you know what?

02:01.798 --> 02:03.341
I respect that.

02:03.425 --> 02:06.761
You scrapped like a motherfucker
to get where you are.

02:06.844 --> 02:08.465
But don't think for a second

02:08.555 --> 02:13.393
that just because I was born into this,
that makes me soft,

02:13.470 --> 02:15.728
'cause that would be
a big fucking mistake.

02:18.773 --> 02:20.191
You're right.

02:20.275 --> 02:23.861
My brother and I have
a complicated relationship.

02:23.945 --> 02:27.449
But I would never let that get
in the way of business,

02:27.532 --> 02:29.742
which is why I think
we need to keep an eye on him.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.244
The fuck are you talking about?

02:31.328 --> 02:34.372
I'm sure you've noticed
he's gotten close with our printer.

02:34.456 --> 02:35.665
Our only printer.

02:35.748 --> 02:36.791
Yeah, so?

02:36.874 --> 02:38.209
How well do you know her?

02:38.293 --> 02:41.588
Because she's seen enough
to sink our entire operation.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.676
If my brother were to become
a little too attached,

02:46.759 --> 02:49.971
well, that could be a big problem.

04:55.972 --> 04:59.559
Anyone tell you
you snore like sick cow?

05:05.982 --> 05:07.942
Already tried that.

05:15.825 --> 05:17.827
- Where are we?
- Train.

05:20.657 --> 05:22.874
I mean...

05:22.957 --> 05:24.166
where are we going?

05:24.251 --> 05:27.879
Wherever they go
to collect price on your head.

05:29.547 --> 05:31.883
Happy Jack don't like you much.

05:31.966 --> 05:34.051
It seems to me
he doesn't like you much either.

05:36.053 --> 05:37.389
So...

05:39.974 --> 05:42.269
...you tell me.

05:42.352 --> 05:44.396
Where are we going?

05:50.902 --> 05:52.069
Home.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.620
Hey, Ah Sahm.

06:00.697 --> 06:05.082
Just getting Father Jun up
to speed on our new alliance.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.670
How much do you trust Mai Ling to hold up
her end of the deal?

06:08.753 --> 06:12.173
As long as we're offering
something better than war, we're good.

06:12.257 --> 06:13.800
It doesn't mean I trust her.

06:13.883 --> 06:16.010
Counterfeiting is risky.

06:16.093 --> 06:18.971
Add to that a partner you can't count on,

06:19.055 --> 06:21.599
and it's just a matter of time
before the deal goes sideways.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.602
We need to prepare.

06:24.686 --> 06:26.646
Father Jun knows a couple of Krauts

06:26.723 --> 06:29.316
who are sitting on a silver claim
a couple of hours east.

06:29.399 --> 06:31.276
Old-school gangsters we can work with.

06:31.359 --> 06:32.819
Work with how?

06:32.902 --> 06:35.697
Trade fake chop for silver.

06:35.780 --> 06:37.990
We pay them three times the going rate.

06:38.533 --> 06:39.784
That's a steep markup.

06:39.867 --> 06:43.413
It is, but we come away
with something of real value,

06:43.496 --> 06:46.833
something we can count on
more than our partners.

06:50.670 --> 06:51.629
It's a big move.

06:54.006 --> 06:55.752
You two should talk it over.

06:59.804 --> 07:01.222
I'm sorry.
I think I missed something.

07:01.306 --> 07:03.057
Is Father Jun
running the show now?

07:03.140 --> 07:04.517
Of course not.

07:04.601 --> 07:06.394
I know you two didn't
always get along, but--

07:06.478 --> 07:08.396
We led a coup against him.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.024
But whatever beef we've had,
he's always put the tong first.

07:12.108 --> 07:14.361
You're talking
about adding another partner.

07:14.444 --> 07:16.070
That's more risk, more exposure.

07:16.153 --> 07:18.948
It's better than grabbing our ankles
and waiting for Mai Ling to fuck us.

07:25.162 --> 07:26.331
Okay.

07:26.414 --> 07:27.665
- Okay?
- Okay.

07:27.749 --> 07:29.041
Okay.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.961
- When do you leave?
- We leave tomorrow morning.

07:33.255 --> 07:34.714
What, you thought
you were staying home?

07:34.791 --> 07:36.341
I need a translator.

07:37.592 --> 07:39.218
I don't speak German.

07:39.302 --> 07:42.305
And I'm betting those Krauts
don't speak Cantonese either.

07:42.389 --> 07:43.515
You're coming.

07:43.598 --> 07:44.932
This sounds like my kind of party.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.601
- You're not coming.
- What?

07:46.684 --> 07:48.102
Why the fuck not?

07:48.185 --> 07:50.355
Someone has to run this place
while we're gone.

07:56.611 --> 07:59.656
The men you kill,
who are they?

08:02.199 --> 08:03.868
Enemy?

08:05.995 --> 08:07.705
Friend?

08:09.499 --> 08:11.334
Or maybe family?

08:11.418 --> 08:13.127
If you want to get out of here,
feel free to pitch in.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.796
Better to save energy.

08:14.879 --> 08:16.548
Then stop wasting it talking.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.343
What is her name?

08:25.014 --> 08:28.059
Men kill for money or love.

08:28.142 --> 08:31.563
You no care for money,
so what is her name?

08:34.566 --> 08:37.109
Chao maybe die because of you.

08:37.193 --> 08:39.070
Deserve to know why.

08:39.153 --> 08:41.906
We are both in this mess because of you.

08:41.989 --> 08:45.618
All you deserve is whatever's waiting
for you at the end of the line.

08:45.702 --> 08:47.579
God willing, that's a bullet or a noose.

08:49.497 --> 08:53.418
You are the one wanted
for murder, Agent Lee, not me.

08:55.127 --> 08:56.379
You're right, Chao.

08:57.839 --> 08:59.876
Maybe they won't kill you.

08:59.966 --> 09:02.385
Maybe they'll just keep you in chains
the rest of your life.

09:06.806 --> 09:08.182
God.

09:13.187 --> 09:14.772
And how long will you be gone?

09:17.817 --> 09:19.361
A couple days.

09:19.444 --> 09:20.820
Maybe three.

09:23.448 --> 09:27.452
Hey, I'll be fine.

09:27.535 --> 09:29.412
I'm not worried about you.

09:31.539 --> 09:34.626
There are a thousand ways
that this could go bad.

09:36.127 --> 09:38.212
And I'm in the middle of all of them.

09:39.088 --> 09:40.840
That means you're valuable.

09:41.799 --> 09:43.676
No one will touch you.

09:44.427 --> 09:46.638
Unless your sister
betrays your best friend.

09:47.555 --> 09:49.140
And then I'm a target.

09:49.223 --> 09:51.434
Look, they tried killing
each other before, right?

09:51.518 --> 09:54.020
So what's stopping them from trying again?

09:54.103 --> 09:56.981
Right now they need each other.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.691
They both need you.

10:02.111 --> 10:03.863
Lucky me.

10:31.057 --> 10:33.059
How long no opium?

10:33.768 --> 10:35.186
I'm fine.

10:35.270 --> 10:36.973
You look fine.

10:46.323 --> 10:48.450
Will anyone notice
you're missing?

10:50.327 --> 10:51.494
No.

10:52.829 --> 10:54.914
I thought Chao was
a friend to everyone.

10:58.876 --> 11:00.211
You?

11:00.295 --> 11:01.838
Abigail.

11:01.921 --> 11:04.632
She won't know how to find me,
but she'll try.

11:04.716 --> 11:06.301
If she want to find you.

11:07.552 --> 11:10.513
She is Happy Jack's sister-in-law, no?

11:10.597 --> 11:14.141
Maybe she tell him about bounty.

11:14.225 --> 11:15.643
Maybe they share.

11:18.771 --> 11:21.065
Well, not everyone's like you.

11:23.693 --> 11:24.944
Like me?

11:25.862 --> 11:27.905
You think you know Chao?

11:28.906 --> 11:30.325
I know enough.

11:31.326 --> 11:35.580
I know you'd sell your own child
if you could turn a profit.

11:36.539 --> 11:41.336
And you'd do just about anything
to anyone for the right price.

11:45.798 --> 11:48.134
Such a simple point of view.

11:49.802 --> 11:52.805
Like a stupid child.

11:54.641 --> 11:57.018
Money important, sure.

11:57.101 --> 11:58.895
But money is easy.

11:58.978 --> 12:02.232
Deal is what matter.

12:02.315 --> 12:04.776
Deal is everything.

12:07.445 --> 12:08.905
We shake hand.

12:08.988 --> 12:11.533
Now you not white.
I not Chinese.

12:11.616 --> 12:14.536
Now we are partner.

12:14.619 --> 12:16.538
You don't like me, so what?

12:16.621 --> 12:20.292
Want to kill me?
Don't matter because we have deal.

12:22.377 --> 12:27.299
Right deal turn slave into man.

12:27.382 --> 12:30.760
Turn man into...

12:30.843 --> 12:32.929
American.

12:33.805 --> 12:37.934
Enough money, make any deal,

12:38.017 --> 12:40.019
become anyone.

12:46.276 --> 12:47.610
Pretty picture.

12:49.028 --> 12:50.613
All I see...

12:52.865 --> 12:57.113
...is a man who has no loyalties,

12:57.203 --> 12:59.581
who has no one,
and stands for nothing.

13:00.748 --> 13:03.626
Now, you like to think
that makes you smart.

13:06.122 --> 13:08.465
In my mind, that makes you a coward.

13:08.548 --> 13:12.051
No, that make me free.

13:15.555 --> 13:17.640
And how's that working out?

13:26.983 --> 13:29.777
He's been missing
for two nights now.

13:29.861 --> 13:32.780
It's not like him to stay out
without telling me.

13:32.864 --> 13:35.908
A man gets his fill of home...

13:38.154 --> 13:40.705
...his eye tends to wander.

13:41.539 --> 13:45.001
- It was only a matter of time.
- Richard's not the wandering kind.

13:45.084 --> 13:47.086
He wandered into here, didn't he?

13:48.880 --> 13:50.673
Looking for his drugs.

13:51.883 --> 13:54.218
Just tell me you didn't have
anything to do with this.

13:56.263 --> 14:00.642
I told your idiot cop that he was putting
you in danger by being here.

14:00.725 --> 14:01.934
Who knows?

14:02.018 --> 14:04.103
Maybe he finally did
the smart thing and left

14:04.180 --> 14:06.022
before getting the both of you killed.

14:06.105 --> 14:08.024
Insult him all you want.

14:08.107 --> 14:10.402
Richard's ten times
the man you are.

14:13.905 --> 14:17.909
If I was you,
I would walk out of that door right now...

14:20.328 --> 14:24.291
...before you find out
the kind of man I really am.

14:44.394 --> 14:46.771
Them Black boys came through
in the end, huh?

14:47.730 --> 14:49.732
Worth every penny we paid them.

14:53.736 --> 14:56.113
Ain't that right,
Cousin Richie?

15:01.160 --> 15:05.498
I got to tell you, I ain't never seen
such a fancy chink before.

15:05.582 --> 15:07.334
Fucker stinks, too, huh?

15:07.417 --> 15:08.876
What do we do with him?

15:14.341 --> 15:16.718
Why don't we let Mama decide?

15:26.263 --> 15:27.937
Bring him here.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.779
I've been waiting
a long time for this day.

15:39.366 --> 15:41.493
What, you got nothing to say
to your Aunt Violet?

15:41.576 --> 15:43.280
Nothing that would change anything.

15:43.370 --> 15:45.663
Don't you talk down to her,
you piece of shit.

15:45.747 --> 15:47.874
You still think
you're better than us, huh?

15:47.957 --> 15:49.626
I say we put him down right now.

15:49.709 --> 15:50.793
No.

15:50.877 --> 15:54.422
He's gonna suffer plenty for what he done,
but not till we get back to Savannah.

15:55.214 --> 15:59.552
We're gonna string you up
from that old oak you used to climb,

15:59.636 --> 16:01.513
the one where I buried my boys.

16:01.596 --> 16:03.598
So it's a family reunion, then?

16:10.307 --> 16:13.065
What do you know about family?

16:13.149 --> 16:17.529
Your mama lost two sons in the war,
God rest their souls.

16:17.612 --> 16:21.908
But I reckon you broke
her heart worst of all,

16:21.991 --> 16:24.076
killing your own kin.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.078
And for what?

16:26.162 --> 16:28.205
Some doe-eyed coon

16:28.290 --> 16:30.917
spread her legs for the first white man
to come along?

16:34.086 --> 16:37.715
Chain him up in the wagon.
We got a long ride ahead.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.133
Mama, what about the chink?

16:41.594 --> 16:43.388
Bring him with.

16:43.471 --> 16:46.266
A strong back like his will come in handy.

17:05.117 --> 17:07.287
You look put off, Mr. Leary.

17:07.364 --> 17:10.122
There's nothing but starched shirts
and puckered assholes.

17:10.206 --> 17:12.208
I don't belong here.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.669
You are the face of San Francisco labor,

17:14.752 --> 17:17.505
and like it or not,
these are the men who control it.

17:17.589 --> 17:19.507
They need to know who you are.

17:19.591 --> 17:20.758
It's a fucking party.

17:20.842 --> 17:22.469
That's right.

17:22.552 --> 17:25.054
So grab a drink and get comfortable.

17:26.848 --> 17:27.974
Whiskey.

17:28.057 --> 17:30.477
- Which kind would you like, sir?
- Do I look like I care?

17:32.437 --> 17:34.481
He'll have the 18-year.

17:43.365 --> 17:44.907
Fucking hell.

17:48.953 --> 17:51.956
Another one of those.
Fill the fucking glass up this time.

18:34.451 --> 18:37.669
If you chinks are looking
for work, don't bother.

18:37.752 --> 18:39.337
We're full up.

18:39.421 --> 18:42.507
You get a lot of chinks in suits
who want to dig holes for you?

18:48.346 --> 18:49.306
Yeah.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.934
Go tell the Krugers
Father Jun is here to see them.

18:53.017 --> 18:54.561
Father who?

18:55.472 --> 18:58.940
Father Jun, from the Hop Wei tong.

18:59.023 --> 19:00.191
They know him.

19:01.984 --> 19:03.445
Maybe that's true.

19:03.528 --> 19:06.698
Father Jun from the hip-whatever-the-fuck.

19:07.532 --> 19:09.576
See, I need to know
what this is about.

19:09.659 --> 19:10.993
The brothers are busy.

19:30.347 --> 19:31.806
They'll make time.

19:32.807 --> 19:35.852
It's greed, plain and fucking simple.

19:35.935 --> 19:38.896
And if we don't pass laws
to protect the workingmen,

19:38.980 --> 19:40.607
they'll grind us up
till there's nothing left.

19:40.690 --> 19:42.024
What did I tell you, William?

19:42.108 --> 19:44.361
If you can abide a little rough language,

19:44.444 --> 19:46.904
my friend Mr. Leary has
some compelling ideas

19:46.988 --> 19:48.525
about the future of American labor.

19:48.615 --> 19:49.741
Indeed.

19:49.824 --> 19:52.744
I can't say I've ever considered the issue
from that perspective.

19:52.827 --> 19:55.372
Well, it's because you never had
to work for your money.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.249
You was born right on top of it.

20:02.295 --> 20:04.464
If you'll excuse us for a moment.

20:06.924 --> 20:09.927
Careful not to bite
the hand that feeds.

20:10.011 --> 20:12.389
A fucker like that
needs to feel the teeth.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.681
You're not wrong,

20:13.765 --> 20:15.683
and you certainly made an impression.

20:15.767 --> 20:18.603
But you have to understand,
the wealthy are just like everyone else.

20:18.686 --> 20:20.557
They operate out of self-interest,

20:20.647 --> 20:22.357
and they won't take you seriously

20:22.440 --> 20:27.194
until you're equipped to either
give them something they want

20:27.279 --> 20:30.072
or take away something
they can't bear to lose.

20:31.699 --> 20:33.451
Let me show you.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.295
The money is perfect.
You won't have any problem passing it off.

20:48.258 --> 20:50.718
It's all fine and pretty, huh?

20:50.802 --> 20:53.930
Like a little tiny sparrow.

20:59.101 --> 21:03.690
If the money is so good,
then why not spend it yourself?

21:04.857 --> 21:06.901
Well, there's a lot
of heat on us right now,

21:06.984 --> 21:09.321
so it's safer outside the city.

21:18.955 --> 21:21.040
It looks good, yes?

21:21.123 --> 21:22.917
It looks risky.

21:24.669 --> 21:26.623
You look risky.

21:30.132 --> 21:32.844
Papa used to own a shipping business.

21:32.927 --> 21:36.138
Had a lot of dealing
with Father Jun back in the day.

21:37.474 --> 21:39.851
Then when I was a boy,
he used to scare the piss out of me

21:39.934 --> 21:41.561
'cause that eye.

21:43.187 --> 21:44.689
He also killed my dog.

21:46.023 --> 21:47.359
Did he tell you?

21:48.235 --> 21:50.111
My hound, Cecil.

21:51.571 --> 21:52.989
He didn't mention it.

21:53.072 --> 21:54.651
You must ask him about it.

21:54.741 --> 21:55.742
I will.

22:04.959 --> 22:06.336
You mean right now?

22:06.419 --> 22:07.754
Oh, yeah.

22:10.047 --> 22:11.424
Okay.

22:13.468 --> 22:15.928
He wants me to ask you
about killing his dog.

22:16.888 --> 22:17.889
Cecil.

22:17.972 --> 22:19.641
The fuck is this guy's problem?

22:31.688 --> 22:34.364
Fucking mutt

22:34.447 --> 22:37.534
had it coming.

22:49.706 --> 22:51.673
So he didn't kill your dog?

22:51.756 --> 22:53.710
Oh, yes, he did, with a hatchet.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.802
That creature was a demon shit, huh?

22:58.095 --> 23:00.307
Twenty-five cents on the dollar.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.224
Four to one, and you have a deal.

23:09.524 --> 23:12.652
Four to one.

23:16.781 --> 23:18.032
Deal.

23:19.867 --> 23:21.160
Wunderbar.

23:29.252 --> 23:31.963
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Lovely to see you.

23:32.046 --> 23:33.750
Enjoy the party.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.882
Douglas.

23:35.752 --> 23:37.302
So glad you could make it.

23:37.385 --> 23:39.429
I was happy to be invited.

23:39.512 --> 23:41.180
Anna's grown into quite a beauty.

23:41.264 --> 23:42.139
Thank you.

23:43.558 --> 23:45.727
I'm afraid I haven't met your guest.

23:45.810 --> 23:48.605
This is Dylan Leary.
He represents the Workingmen's Party.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.357
Mr. Leary, of course.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.360
Quite a feat you've pulled off,
organizing Irish labor.

23:53.443 --> 23:57.239
Well, the men will always come together
under the threat of a common enemy.

23:57.322 --> 24:00.950
- You're speaking about the Chinese?
- A lot more than I want to be.

24:01.701 --> 24:05.162
Mr. Leary and I share some concerns
about the future of this city.

24:05.247 --> 24:07.457
We'd love to bend your ear
if you're not too busy.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.126
This is my daughter's
engagement party, gentlemen.

24:10.209 --> 24:14.422
If you want to discuss politics,
we can schedule something for next week.

24:15.423 --> 24:18.050
Arthur seems like a fine young man.

24:19.093 --> 24:21.763
Yes, we're quite pleased.

24:21.846 --> 24:23.765
With an even finer pedigree.

24:23.848 --> 24:26.643
Did you know he's the heir
to the Newhouse Shipping fortune?

24:26.726 --> 24:28.102
I did not.

24:28.185 --> 24:32.315
No doubt Mr. Thayer worked very hard
to make this marriage happen.

24:33.233 --> 24:35.235
Of course, the whole thing
would fall apart

24:35.318 --> 24:38.905
if the family found out
that Anna is damaged goods.

24:40.448 --> 24:41.741
That's outrageous.

24:41.818 --> 24:43.660
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing--

24:43.743 --> 24:45.870
The way I hear it, she had a fling
with one of the servants--

24:45.953 --> 24:49.749
some dago without a pot to piss in--
and found herself in the family way.

24:49.826 --> 24:51.709
Now, this wasn't the kind of future

24:51.793 --> 24:54.379
that Franklin here had in mind
for his precious little girl,

24:54.462 --> 24:57.340
so he raised the boy as his own,

24:57.424 --> 24:59.259
sparing Anna the public humiliation

24:59.342 --> 25:02.512
and, of course, protecting
her value as a bride.

25:04.889 --> 25:06.474
What the hell do you want?

25:08.017 --> 25:11.145
I want you to think about
what's best for your family.

25:21.614 --> 25:25.452
If you had that kind of dirt on Thayer,
why not use it after he wins the election?

25:25.535 --> 25:27.036
You'd own him.

25:27.119 --> 25:30.867
Because, at heart,
Thayer is an honest man,

25:30.957 --> 25:34.961
and I have absolutely no use
for an honest mayor.

26:01.529 --> 26:03.573
- Thank you.
- Bitte.

26:03.656 --> 26:06.117
Quite an operation you got here.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.952
I accept your compliment.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.498
We employ more
than 600 Chinese on our claim.

26:11.581 --> 26:14.501
They work for scraps, and we get rich.

26:14.584 --> 26:16.378
The American dream, yes?

26:17.879 --> 26:18.963
For someone.

26:19.916 --> 26:22.634
- Why a church?
- Well, because nobody was using it.

26:23.426 --> 26:25.470
You see, the Spaniards--

26:25.553 --> 26:29.349
they came to convert
the savages, but--

26:29.432 --> 26:31.434
Move it, asshole!

26:34.061 --> 26:37.565
See, the Spanish, they came
to convert the savages,

26:37.649 --> 26:42.570
but the savages didn't want their God,
so they took their scalps instead.

26:42.654 --> 26:46.115
And then the Mexicans,
they killed the savages,

26:46.198 --> 26:48.410
and the Mormons killed the Mexicans.

26:50.036 --> 26:53.831
So much blood spilt
in the name of God, huh?

26:55.458 --> 26:57.752
And then we discovered silver.

26:57.835 --> 27:01.256
And once, where there was God,

27:01.339 --> 27:04.342
now there's commerce.

27:07.219 --> 27:08.846
You like pussy, yes?

27:13.059 --> 27:14.811
Yeah.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.187
We like pussy.

27:16.271 --> 27:18.147
Then you must stay the night.

27:18.231 --> 27:21.943
Eat, drink, fuck our women.
We finish business in the morning.

27:22.026 --> 27:23.820
Good?

27:23.903 --> 27:25.697
- Sure.
- Good.

27:27.490 --> 27:29.284
Those crazy fucking Krauts.

27:29.367 --> 27:32.119
I didn't know if they were
gonna shoot us or eat us.

27:32.203 --> 27:34.247
Neither would have surprised me.

27:34.331 --> 27:37.417
To Cecil.

27:38.710 --> 27:40.211
That fucking dog.

27:40.295 --> 27:41.504
To Cecil.

27:55.852 --> 27:57.395
Valentina wants to know

27:57.479 --> 28:00.147
if she's supposed to fuck
all of you or what?

28:01.774 --> 28:02.942
Just him.

28:04.361 --> 28:06.112
The tiny one only.

28:08.615 --> 28:10.575
Is she all they got?

28:10.658 --> 28:11.993
What, is she not enough?

28:12.076 --> 28:14.454
Fuck you.
She might kill me.

28:14.537 --> 28:16.205
Well, what a way to die.

28:17.033 --> 28:18.625
I'll wait if you want to go, too.

28:18.708 --> 28:20.710
I'm good.

28:20.793 --> 28:24.005
Yeah, I guess you're getting
all the sticky you need from our printer.

28:25.548 --> 28:27.759
We'll talk about
your shitty judgment later...

28:31.137 --> 28:32.347
...if I survive.

28:48.571 --> 28:50.323
What the fuck?

29:08.716 --> 29:10.593
Come, my little Zeus.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.411
I imagine this must be hard for you.

29:38.580 --> 29:39.747
Having me back.

29:43.793 --> 29:45.628
If he's happy, I'm happy.

29:47.004 --> 29:49.257
I'm not sure he is.

29:49.341 --> 29:52.719
Though, to be honest,
I don't think he ever has been.

29:52.802 --> 29:56.013
Young Jun came into this world
full of piss and vinegar,

29:56.097 --> 29:58.308
and he'll probably leave it the same way.

29:58.391 --> 30:01.018
He needs people around him he can trust.

30:01.102 --> 30:05.482
Right now he's not sure who that is.

30:05.565 --> 30:08.526
He's got his brothers.
That hasn't changed.

30:12.322 --> 30:15.450
It's no secret
I never liked you, Ah Sahm.

30:15.533 --> 30:16.534
Yeah.

30:17.660 --> 30:20.372
But maybe that's because
I didn't understand you.

30:21.205 --> 30:23.666
- And now you do?
- Better than I used to.

30:23.750 --> 30:28.463
Being torn between blood and duty--
that's a hard way to live.

30:30.214 --> 30:32.216
Not as hard as you think.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.594
Mai Ling tried to have me diced, remember?

30:36.304 --> 30:38.890
And now we're doing business with her.

30:40.475 --> 30:43.603
The point is, blood is messy.

30:47.774 --> 30:51.152
I think you care about my son,
but you're unsettled.

30:51.236 --> 30:55.657
And a man in chaos is chaos first.

30:56.991 --> 30:58.285
Chaos?

30:59.994 --> 31:01.663
Is that how you see me?

31:01.746 --> 31:04.291
It's nothing personal.

31:04.374 --> 31:06.167
I was once the same way.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.753
And what changed?

31:11.088 --> 31:12.799
I grew the fuck up.

31:21.849 --> 31:23.268
That good, huh?

31:23.351 --> 31:25.270
I can't feel my body.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.067
Tell the bartender
to bring another bottle.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.444
I think it's time I turned in.

31:34.529 --> 31:35.905
I'll see you two in the morning.

31:35.988 --> 31:37.865
Good night, Dad.

31:37.949 --> 31:38.950
Night.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.749
Tell me everything.

31:50.878 --> 31:53.340
No bullshit, man, that girl...

31:53.423 --> 31:55.342
she was like...

31:55.425 --> 31:57.677
I'm not a religious person or anything,

31:57.760 --> 32:03.057
but I'm pretty damn sure
that was a spiritual experience.

32:03.140 --> 32:04.351
You know what I mean?

32:05.768 --> 32:07.144
I really don't.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.609
I think she cracked a rib.

32:25.788 --> 32:26.956
Hey.

32:30.418 --> 32:32.379
I was an asshole before.

32:34.714 --> 32:37.008
You could have let me get on that boat...

32:38.801 --> 32:39.802
...but you didn't.

32:42.179 --> 32:43.222
Yeah, well...

32:45.099 --> 32:46.601
What the fuck is that?

32:49.103 --> 32:50.355
You hear that?

33:02.033 --> 33:03.034
Hey!

33:04.201 --> 33:05.953
What the hell is going on?

33:06.037 --> 33:09.123
This is a private matter, I'm afraid.

33:09.206 --> 33:12.294
Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't look
fucking private to me.

33:12.377 --> 33:16.047
This half-breed stole scrip
from the general store

33:16.130 --> 33:18.966
and must be taught a lesson.

33:19.050 --> 33:21.052
Well, I think he got the message.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.472
They say he was stealing.

33:24.556 --> 33:25.890
He probably was.

33:27.475 --> 33:31.062
Are we going to have a problem?

33:34.732 --> 33:36.401
It's up to you.

33:37.193 --> 33:39.862
What is it?
What is happening?

33:41.072 --> 33:43.658
Mein herren, I think
we should all just relax, yes?

33:44.617 --> 33:47.829
Let him go. Now!

33:50.081 --> 33:53.370
I am really, really sorry
that you had to see this,

33:53.460 --> 33:55.545
but larceny is rampant here,

33:55.628 --> 33:58.130
and my brother is what
you call...

33:58.673 --> 33:59.882
A stickler.

34:01.884 --> 34:04.136
A stickler for the rules.

34:05.382 --> 34:07.181
Stickler, huh?

34:11.185 --> 34:15.523
Perhaps you would like
to go to sleep now, yes?

34:15.607 --> 34:17.984
Tomorrow we all make
a shit ton of money together.

34:19.444 --> 34:21.613
Their property, their rules.

34:21.696 --> 34:23.490
Don't fuck up the deal.

34:32.582 --> 34:35.335
Hop away.

35:02.153 --> 35:03.440
What the fuck was that?

35:08.535 --> 35:12.622
Yeah, she's stuck good.
Gonna have to dig her out.

35:12.705 --> 35:14.416
Why should we break our backs?

35:14.499 --> 35:17.252
Chinese are known
for their digging skills.

35:17.335 --> 35:19.003
Isn't that right, big boy?

35:19.086 --> 35:20.755
Come on.

35:20.838 --> 35:22.299
Start digging.

35:26.052 --> 35:28.846
Listen, cocksucker,
you better make yourself useful,

35:28.930 --> 35:31.140
or I'm gonna bury you in these here woods.

35:35.061 --> 35:36.604
I said get to work!

35:38.940 --> 35:39.941
Well, goddamn.

35:41.192 --> 35:44.279
It looks like this one's got
a history of bad behavior.

35:44.362 --> 35:46.989
Maybe a few more licks
will smarten him up.

35:47.824 --> 35:49.200
You're gonna wish you played nice.

35:53.746 --> 35:56.583
I will cut your fucking teeth
out one by one.

35:57.750 --> 35:58.751
Stop.

35:59.919 --> 36:03.631
It seems like you got a bleeding heart
for everyone but your own kind.

36:04.424 --> 36:06.384
You've never been my kind.

36:08.303 --> 36:10.096
Go on, hit him again.

36:10.179 --> 36:11.556
God damn it, Carter.

36:11.639 --> 36:13.140
Shoot his ass.

36:18.938 --> 36:21.608
String him up.
Keep your eye on him.

37:37.058 --> 37:38.268
Any sign?

37:55.535 --> 37:57.036
What are you looking at?

37:59.038 --> 38:01.541
I hate seeing you swept up in all this.

38:03.793 --> 38:06.338
You were always such a good boy, Carter.

38:07.129 --> 38:08.548
Always...

38:09.716 --> 38:11.801
...always smiling,
ever since you were knee-high.

38:11.884 --> 38:13.928
I ain't a boy anymore.

38:14.929 --> 38:15.930
No.

38:17.682 --> 38:19.351
I guess it has been a while.

38:22.144 --> 38:23.896
You know, I--

38:23.980 --> 38:26.441
I still remember teaching you how to swim.

38:26.524 --> 38:29.068
Remember when you were six or seven,
out at Crawford's ranch?

38:29.151 --> 38:30.862
- You remember that?
- You need to stop talking to me.

38:30.945 --> 38:34.782
And you were holding on to my shoulder
like your life depended on it.

38:34.866 --> 38:36.576
You had this...

38:37.744 --> 38:40.872
...terrified look in the eye,
kind of like...

38:40.955 --> 38:42.164
kind of like you do now.

38:42.249 --> 38:44.083
Shut up. I'm warning you.

38:44.166 --> 38:48.170
But after a few minutes, you realized
you weren't gonna drown.

38:49.213 --> 38:51.758
You were strong enough
to swim on your own.

38:53.175 --> 38:55.595
And you spent the rest
of the day chasing mudpuppies, and...

38:56.596 --> 38:58.473
I don't think I'd ever seen you so happy.

39:02.602 --> 39:06.063
You were never, ever like your brothers.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.901
You were smarter, kinder.

39:12.362 --> 39:15.156
I always figured you'd leave home
and get away from all this.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.616
Yeah, me too.

39:17.742 --> 39:19.869
And then you went and killed my brothers,

39:19.952 --> 39:22.372
and I had no choice, did I?

39:23.039 --> 39:25.417
I had to stay to help Mom and Bo.

39:28.336 --> 39:30.212
I'm sorry, Carter. I...

39:31.631 --> 39:33.341
You know, I never meant
to hurt them.

39:34.133 --> 39:37.178
It haunts me every day,
and I know I'll have to answer for it.

39:37.262 --> 39:38.805
But whether I live or die,

39:38.888 --> 39:41.974
you have to get away from here.

39:42.058 --> 39:43.560
Get away from her

39:43.643 --> 39:46.062
before she turns you
into something you're not.

39:46.145 --> 39:48.315
What the hell is going on here?

39:48.398 --> 39:50.191
Nothing, Ma.

39:50.275 --> 39:52.569
He was just running his mouth.

39:53.528 --> 39:57.073
My boys know who they are.
They don't turn on family.

39:57.156 --> 39:58.283
Damn right.

39:58.366 --> 39:59.617
Where's the Chinaman?

39:59.701 --> 40:01.286
Oh, that fucker got away.

40:01.369 --> 40:03.204
Don't matter. We got bigger fish to fry.

40:03.288 --> 40:04.497
Fix the wagon.

40:04.581 --> 40:06.458
- Well--
- Now, damn it!

40:08.793 --> 40:13.005
In the meantime, why don't you
show your cousin who you are?

40:16.801 --> 40:21.264
A soft heart won't do you
no favors in this world.

41:11.022 --> 41:14.984
A pleasure, as always,
Father Jun of the Hop Wei tong.

41:15.067 --> 41:17.945
Come back in four weeks,
we do it again, yeah?

41:18.029 --> 41:20.782
Four week we come.

41:28.373 --> 41:31.334
The good stuff for the good stuff.

42:02.907 --> 42:05.201
Those twisted fucks
came through.

42:05.285 --> 42:07.161
And you thought
it was too risky.

42:07.245 --> 42:09.622
Okay, go ahead, gloat. You deserve it.

42:09.706 --> 42:12.334
Damn right I do. We all do.

42:19.006 --> 42:20.508
What's going on?

42:40.237 --> 42:41.404
Ah Sahm.

42:43.531 --> 42:46.951
We got the silver.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

42:47.034 --> 42:47.994
No!

42:48.077 --> 42:49.412
No!

43:01.132 --> 43:02.550
This is our fault.

43:02.634 --> 43:03.718
Bullshit.

43:04.427 --> 43:06.012
We don't know what happened.

43:07.514 --> 43:09.223
They wanted us to see him.

43:11.684 --> 43:14.437
See if we do a fucking thing about it.

43:27.242 --> 43:28.326
I'm sorry.

43:28.410 --> 43:30.453
He didn't steal anything.

43:30.537 --> 43:32.372
He was a good boy.

43:48.054 --> 43:49.221
Don't be stupid.

43:49.306 --> 43:51.182
This place is our meal ticket.

43:51.266 --> 43:53.893
You go back in there,
and the deal is dead, you get me?

43:55.061 --> 43:57.063
This is not your fight.

44:07.114 --> 44:08.700
Yes, it is.

44:11.911 --> 44:13.079
Fuck.

44:14.706 --> 44:16.374
Wait up, man!

44:23.214 --> 44:25.091
Stupid fucking onions.

46:11.656 --> 46:14.075
It could have been
so easy, Hop Wei.

46:15.034 --> 46:18.788
All you had to do was scurry
back to your little hole!

46:22.417 --> 46:25.378
Now we are in conflict, yes?

47:23.895 --> 47:28.107
You should know, Hop Wei,
the boy died like my Cecil--

47:28.184 --> 47:30.402
whimpering and lost,

47:30.485 --> 47:33.988
wondering why God had abandoned him.

47:34.071 --> 47:36.449
But in his final moments, he realized.

47:36.533 --> 47:38.951
He learned what we all must eventually.

47:39.661 --> 47:43.248
There is no God.

47:53.591 --> 47:54.759
Fuck.

49:47.622 --> 49:48.956
We good in there?

49:49.040 --> 49:50.166
All good.

49:50.250 --> 49:51.584
Holy shit.

49:51.668 --> 49:53.628
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

49:53.711 --> 49:55.332
It's a fucking shotgun.

49:55.422 --> 49:57.632
You pick it up and pull the trigger.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.801
Dad!

50:03.846 --> 50:06.057
Fucking Kraut clipped me.

50:07.309 --> 50:08.518
He needs a healer.

50:08.601 --> 50:09.894
I'm fine.

50:09.977 --> 50:12.021
No, you're not.

50:12.104 --> 50:14.232
Trust me, I've seen worse.

50:14.316 --> 50:16.734
We need to get away before more men come.

50:16.818 --> 50:18.570
We can find a healer on the way.

50:18.653 --> 50:20.905
No. Get me back to Chinatown.

50:25.327 --> 50:26.661
Come on.

50:32.875 --> 50:35.044
You took my sons from me.

50:37.374 --> 50:40.925
You cut them down in cold blood
like it was nothing.

50:42.134 --> 50:44.887
Losing a child is like losing a limb.

50:46.180 --> 50:47.384
The pain never dulls.

50:47.474 --> 50:51.018
It just grows like the roots of a weed

50:51.102 --> 50:52.604
till it chokes out everything else.

50:52.687 --> 50:54.231
You ain't done losing them.

50:54.314 --> 50:55.357
What did you say?

50:57.567 --> 50:59.193
It's only a matter of time.

51:00.111 --> 51:03.197
Sure, I shot your boys, and that's on me,

51:03.281 --> 51:06.659
but it was you who put them
in the firing line.

51:06.743 --> 51:09.996
And when it happens to Bo and Carter,
it'll be you pushing them there, too.

51:10.079 --> 51:11.664
Son of a bitch.

51:11.748 --> 51:14.292
Time to end this once and for all.

51:15.167 --> 51:18.588
I don't want your blood
poisoning the ground

51:18.671 --> 51:21.090
where I laid my sons to rest.

51:23.134 --> 51:25.845
Better you die right here

51:25.928 --> 51:29.349
and rot in the sun like the dog you are.

51:46.533 --> 51:47.534
Down!

52:03.550 --> 52:04.759
You came back.

52:07.464 --> 52:09.013
I needed horse.

52:21.651 --> 52:22.819
Carter.

52:24.111 --> 52:25.482
Carter, put the gun down.

52:26.197 --> 52:27.407
What?

52:28.741 --> 52:30.827
So you do me like you done them?

52:31.828 --> 52:35.623
You put the gun down, you can walk away.

52:35.707 --> 52:36.833
I promise you.

52:36.916 --> 52:37.834
No, no, no!
