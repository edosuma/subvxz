<i>Eyewitness News,</i>

00:34.680 --> 00:37.968
<i>the Chicago area's leading news,
with John Brewery.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:39.680
<i>Prominent Chicago businessman</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:42.809
<i>and real estate developer
Isaac Paulson is due in court today,</i>

00:43.240 --> 00:45.640
<i>where he is expected
to be sentenced for his part</i>

00:45.720 --> 00:47.882
<i>in a tax fraud and money laundering scheme</i>

00:48.160 --> 00:50.560
<i>that robbed retirees and pension funds</i>

00:50.640 --> 00:52.927
<i>of nearly $75 million.</i>

03:25.840 --> 03:30.322
Five bedrooms, tennis courts,
and almost 25 acres of woods.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.486
What's an acre?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.047
Mom?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.764
It's a measurement of land.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.242
Uh, it's like the size of someone's property.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.324
- I thought Grandpa lived in the city.
- He did.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.564
Uh, he kept this place as, like, a...
Like a vacation house.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.280
So, why are you selling it?

03:54.360 --> 03:55.920
Because it's part of the estate.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.845
And that's what you do
when someone passes away.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.123
But why are you selling it?

04:01.280 --> 04:05.080
Because it reminds her of everything
she hated about her father.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.771
Really?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.604
What? That's what you said.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.760
Just because your grandfather and I didn't
get along doesn't mean I hated him.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.763
If you died, I won't sell our house.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.041
Hmm. I would.

04:18.519 --> 04:22.079
She's just ornery 'cause she was supposed
to see her boyfriend this weekend.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.480
Whatever. He's not my boyfriend.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.531
Then why did he make you
a playlist filled with sex songs?

04:29.800 --> 04:32.120
Oh, my God. Shut up, freak. Mom!

04:32.200 --> 04:33.240
Mom!

04:33.320 --> 04:34.520
Seriously, I'm gonna kill you.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.603
Okay, enough, both of you.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.760
I know this is not how you wanted
to spend your weekend.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.968
But guess what? Me, neither.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.085
So, a whole playlist?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.250
All right. We're here.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.166
Grandpa had horses?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.600
Mmm-hmm.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.489
He sold them after I left.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.525
You grew up here?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.160
Mmm-hmm.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.571
What do you think?

06:39.080 --> 06:40.320
Seems lonely.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.891
What's wrong?

07:33.760 --> 07:35.603
I don't know. Stay here.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.768
The power must've went out.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.562
Hey, Jas, can you see
if you can turn that thing off?

08:03.920 --> 08:05.490
I get first dibs on a bedroom.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.490
Whatever. Nobody cares.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.201
Hi, Maggie.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.600
<i>You guys get in okay?</i>

08:29.680 --> 08:31.125
Yeah, just a few minutes ago.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.039
<i>I hope traffic wasn't too bad.</i>

08:33.120 --> 08:34.360
No, we missed most of it.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.770
<i>Oh, good, good.</i>

08:35.960 --> 08:39.328
<i>Listen, if it's all right with you,
I'll drop off the paperwork tonight.</i>

08:39.720 --> 08:43.121
<i>We should be able to have the house
on the market as soon as next week.</i>

08:43.480 --> 08:44.561
<i>Shaun, are you there?</i>

08:45.080 --> 08:46.571
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- <i>Okay.</i>

08:46.680 --> 08:51.080
<i>Well, I just want to say again how sorry
I was to hear about your father.</i>

08:51.160 --> 08:53.402
All right. Well, we'll see you tonight.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.561
Thank God there's some cell phone service.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.360
Girl, you just got
your phone privileges back.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.646
Don't abuse them.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.764
Listen, I'm gonna need you and Glover's help
this weekend to get the house ready.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.085
What? I heard you.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.800
Good. You can start by unloading the car.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.042
Is that a request or an order, madam?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.043
I am your mother. Is there a difference?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.251
Now, please.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.885
Thank you.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.881
Mom...

09:30.000 --> 09:31.286
Yes, Jas?

09:32.960 --> 09:33.961
Never mind.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.767
Hey. Hey.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.281
Look,

09:41.200 --> 09:43.168
it's not your job to worry about me.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.924
It's my job to worry about you.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.081
Okay?

09:50.280 --> 09:51.486
All right.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.165
Did I do that?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.611
Glover, did you do that?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.641
Glov?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.166
Glov?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.161
Glov?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.289
Glover, is that you?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.686
In here.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.125
This place is a fortress.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.971
What are you doing in here?

13:05.080 --> 13:08.120
The downstairs windows have
retractable polycarbonate shields.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.009
It's a fully automated security system.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.167
Check it out.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.327
There's cameras in every room,
the yard, the driveway.

13:16.440 --> 13:20.000
Interior motion detectors,
exterior motion-activated lights,

13:20.080 --> 13:21.560
electronic deadbolts.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.920
Where's that music coming from?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.321
This controls everything.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.568
The music, the lights, the whole house.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.205
It's so easy, even you could do it.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.327
Hmm.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.005
Awesome, right?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.921
I guess some people get paranoid
in their old age.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.610
So, what does that make you?

13:40.720 --> 13:41.767
Nearly paranoid?

13:41.880 --> 13:43.960
All right, smart-ass.
Find another place to play.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.531
- Come on.
- I'm hungry.

13:45.760 --> 13:46.840
I'll order a pizza.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.280
That'll take forever.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.805
I think you'll survive.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.051
<i>Hey. I'm still at the office.</i>

14:33.400 --> 14:34.481
Yeah, I figured.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.044
<i>Oh, looks like most of the weekend.</i>

14:37.280 --> 14:38.520
<i>How was the drive?</i>

14:38.880 --> 14:40.086
<i>Are the kids still alive?</i>

14:40.640 --> 14:42.370
- For now.
- <i>How is it?</i>

14:43.280 --> 14:44.520
It's weird.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.443
<i>I bet. You okay?</i>

14:47.160 --> 14:48.600
Yeah. Tired, is all.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.485
<i>Well, listen, sweetheart,
the DA called this morning.</i>

14:51.600 --> 14:53.603
Justin, I don't want to do this, please.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.286
- <i>Shaun...</i>
- No, don't.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.727
I'm barely hanging on as it is.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.080
<i>He was the criminal, Shaun.</i>

15:02.160 --> 15:03.446
<i>How could you have known?</i>

15:03.920 --> 15:06.571
<i>From the moment your mom died,
you were on your own.</i>

15:07.400 --> 15:10.446
<i>Your father needed someone
to blame, and he chose you.</i>

15:11.320 --> 15:13.000
<i>You survived. You got out.</i>

15:13.080 --> 15:14.730
<i>You built a family, a life.</i>

15:16.000 --> 15:17.445
Then why does it feel like I never left?

15:17.560 --> 15:20.280
<i>What he did, what he's done,
is not your fault.</i>

15:20.360 --> 15:22.000
<i>You don't have to pay for his mistakes.</i>

15:22.080 --> 15:25.004
Babe, I just wanna get through
the weekend and come home.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.120
<i>You know I would be there if I could.</i>

15:28.200 --> 15:29.361
I know.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.440
I should go.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.443
- <i>Sweetheart?</i>
- Yeah?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.604
<i>You'll get through this.</i>

15:38.040 --> 15:39.280
<i>Call me tomorrow.</i>

15:40.640 --> 15:41.767
<i>I love you.</i>

15:43.160 --> 15:44.241
I love you, too.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.290
Glover, go.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.891
<i>Jaye's Pizza. Hold, please.</i>

16:33.200 --> 16:34.400
Sure.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.560
Oh!

16:45.640 --> 16:46.971
Shit.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.687
Glover?

18:09.600 --> 18:10.806
Mom?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.041
Glover?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.000
Mom?

18:29.480 --> 18:30.641
Glover.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.040
I swear to God, if you're hiding some...

18:40.320 --> 18:41.447
Let me go!

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
Oh, God!

19:02.880 --> 19:05.486
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down,
and I won't have to hurt you.

19:05.680 --> 19:06.841
Calm the fuck down!

19:14.960 --> 19:16.724
<i>Jaye's Pizza, what can I get for you?</i>

19:17.440 --> 19:18.521
<i>Hello? Can I help you?</i>

19:19.480 --> 19:21.050
- <i>Hello? Are you there?</i>
- Help me!

19:45.960 --> 19:47.690
Jasmine! Glover!

19:48.800 --> 19:50.040
Fucking bitch!

19:55.240 --> 19:56.287
Jasmine!

19:56.840 --> 19:58.808
Jasmine! Glover!

20:01.640 --> 20:02.721
Glover!

20:10.240 --> 20:11.571
Jasmine!

20:12.960 --> 20:14.963
Glover! Can you hear me?

20:18.600 --> 20:19.601
Oh, God.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.251
Oh! Oh!

20:21.760 --> 20:23.922
I'm gonna get you out. I'm gonna get you out.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.685
Move back! Move back!

20:32.200 --> 20:33.201
Mom!

20:43.960 --> 20:45.087
Mom!

20:47.080 --> 20:50.004
I'm gonna get you out, okay? Okay?

20:50.480 --> 20:51.680
Glover, I love you!

20:51.760 --> 20:53.967
- Mom!
- I love you! I love you!

20:54.200 --> 20:55.565
Okay? Okay?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.766
Stop, right there!

21:04.040 --> 21:05.041
Bitch!

21:47.320 --> 21:48.560
She's the old man's daughter.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.321
That's bad fucking luck.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.610
Mom's. Found it in the garage.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.768
She made two calls. One was to
the father, the other was local.

21:59.760 --> 22:00.841
And Pete?

22:00.960 --> 22:02.087
I don't know. He should've been back by now.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.441
Did you call him?

22:03.640 --> 22:05.051
No. He doesn't have a phone.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.924
He thinks the NSA's listening
to him or some shit.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.607
What do you wanna do?

22:08.720 --> 22:11.000
I thought you said no one
came up here without the old man.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.684
Yeah, that's the information I was given.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.320
The information you were given?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.323
I was banging the assistant.
It's not like I knew the guy.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.922
You knew he stashed four million cash
in a safe somewhere in this house.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.563
Or are you not sure about that either?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.565
How about we ask the kids?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.131
You know where the safe is, sweetheart?

22:29.960 --> 22:31.405
They've never been up here. I told you.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.204
The old man didn't talk to his family.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.569
Clearly, you're a fucked-up tweaker
with inaccurate information.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.728
- So, why don't you just shut the fuck up.
- Enough!

23:02.320 --> 23:03.685
Come on, now.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.366
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.251
Fuck.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.921
Bitch!

24:24.120 --> 24:25.121
A phone.

24:26.600 --> 24:27.931
You have a phone.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.765
The situation has changed,
but the objective's the same.

24:52.400 --> 24:56.041
We find the safe, we get the money,
we get the fuck out.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.681
What about them?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.246
They seen our faces.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.841
That's a problem.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.920
- What are you saying, man?
- That we should solve the problem.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.640
They're kids! Jesus, Eddie,
where the fuck did you find this guy?

25:05.720 --> 25:07.400
I found him the same place I found you.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.084
Doing three to five in county.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.602
Only, he wasn't on his knees
in a shower stall.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.965
Look, this is way beyond a break-in.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.841
The minute we cut those phone lines,
the clock started ticking.

25:20.640 --> 25:22.160
If we don't get them back
online in 90 minutes,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.322
the security company's gonna call the police.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.807
Yeah. You're right.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.564
And Pete should've been back by now.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.167
Maybe we should bail.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.210
Can we open the safe without him?

25:33.760 --> 25:35.205
No, we can't.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.490
- What was that?
- The intercom.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.361
Stay with the kids.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.800
Hello.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.200
<i>Hello?</i>

26:00.720 --> 26:01.920
Who is this?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.525
<i>My name is Shaun Russell.</i>

26:04.080 --> 26:07.650
I don't care who you are
or what you're doing in my house.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.690
Please, just let my children go.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.161
Front gate.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.000
You weren't supposed to be here, Shaun.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.445
<i>I'm sorry for that.</i>

26:18.800 --> 26:21.280
This has nothing to do with you or your kids.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.811
<i>Then just let them go.</i>

26:23.160 --> 26:25.686
Okay? We'll just walk away. No police.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.880
<i>No one will ever know. I promise.</i>

26:27.960 --> 26:30.440
I can't do that, Shaun.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.400
But if you come back to the house,
I will not hurt your family.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.084
Then why'd your guy try to kill me?

26:40.280 --> 26:42.442
- Is he alive?
- <i>I want to talk to my children.</i>

26:43.240 --> 26:44.810
I want to know that they're okay.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.606
Not one word about my guy, okay?

26:55.640 --> 26:57.370
We're not gonna hurt your mom.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.929
We just wanna bring her back.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.687
Mom.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.003
Baby, are you okay? Did they hurt you?

27:11.720 --> 27:13.450
- No.
- Your brother?

27:13.760 --> 27:14.966
He's okay.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.891
Mom, I wanna go home.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.686
I know, I know.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.200
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

27:21.280 --> 27:22.805
- Mom, they're coming...
- Jas!

27:30.000 --> 27:31.047
Now,

27:32.320 --> 27:33.560
is my guy still alive?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.247
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:43.080 --> 27:44.127
Good.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.365
<i>That's very good.</i>

27:46.760 --> 27:47.887
What do you want?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.011
I want you to listen.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.966
I imagine, in this moment,
you're questioning whether or not

27:58.080 --> 28:01.004
you and your kids will
make it out of this alive.

28:01.480 --> 28:05.246
<i>The answer to that depends
on who I am, what I'm capable of.</i>

28:05.720 --> 28:09.325
You're thinking, "If not me, then,
 "at least my kids.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.568
"At all costs, "get them back,
no matter what I have to do."

28:14.080 --> 28:16.048
But you know there is nothing you can do.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.526
<i>You are a woman, alone,
at the mercy of strangers.</i>

28:21.120 --> 28:24.522
Your greatest weakness is trapped here,
inside this house, with us.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.488
We will work this out. I promise.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.570
<i>But from this moment on,</i>

28:33.520 --> 28:35.840
you are going to have
to do exactly what I say,

28:35.920 --> 28:38.924
or you and your kids
will not survive this night.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.165
<i>Do you understand?</i>

28:44.720 --> 28:46.131
Do you understand me?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.400
<i>She's gone.</i>

28:52.200 --> 28:53.280
<i>What about Pete?</i>

28:53.360 --> 28:54.566
I don't know.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.687
Lotta fucking nature out here.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.007
Find him.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.291
Well, Duncan was right.
We do have ourselves a problem.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.289
- What about the woman?
- The house is locked down.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.960
She can't get within 15 feet

29:14.040 --> 29:16.282
- without setting off the security lights.
- So?

29:16.520 --> 29:19.046
So, when she does, we solve the problem.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
Now, we're on the clock.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.008
Okay? Right now, our priority
is to find that safe.

29:23.440 --> 29:24.521
What if she goes looking for help?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.165
We have her kids.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.160
She's not going anywhere.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.526
Take the kids upstairs.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.722
Just calm down. Calm down.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.611
I'm gonna remove the gag.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.520
If you scream,

29:48.280 --> 29:50.442
I put it back and walk away. You understand?

30:03.840 --> 30:04.841
How many are there?

30:07.040 --> 30:08.690
They're not gonna find you.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.286
Not out here.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.528
How much longer do you think
you're gonna last?

30:15.320 --> 30:16.970
So, that's what you wanna do?
You wanna die tonight?

30:17.120 --> 30:18.963
Help me. Please.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.527
Four.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.641
There's four of us.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.285
What do you want?

30:28.560 --> 30:29.721
A safe.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.004
Somewhere in the house.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.971
Are they gonna kill my children?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.411
I don't know.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.281
Hey. Listen to me.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.127
I don't know you.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.650
I don't know anything about you.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.566
But these guys, they're for real.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.565
So, if you let me go,

30:50.440 --> 30:51.601
I'll take you back.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.284
We'll figure something out, okay?

30:57.360 --> 30:59.249
You got no other way out of this.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.400
- Hey.
- You're right.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.444
You don't know shit about me.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.491
What the hell is wrong with you?

31:27.760 --> 31:28.966
Where's Mom?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.641
Hi, it's Maggie.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.000
Maggie.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.481
<i>Let her go.</i>

31:51.000 --> 31:52.331
<i>Get back to the house.</i>

31:53.080 --> 31:54.684
Shit! Shit!

32:21.880 --> 32:23.325
Look, somebody's here.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.125
Is it the police?

32:30.680 --> 32:32.205
I don't think so.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.604
Oh. Sorry. Hi.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.604
I'm looking for Shaun Russell.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.768
I'm Maggie Harris, the real estate agent.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.926
Right. Uh, Shaun said you'd be coming.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.130
She, um, ran into town to get some groceries.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.644
Oh, isn't that her car in the driveway?

33:03.680 --> 33:06.763
Yeah, she was having some problems
with it, so I let her take mine.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.880
I'm Mark, by the way.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.564
I'm a friend from Chicago.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.603
I just came to help out with the move.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.326
- Oh, she didn't mention...
- I'm sorry, do you want to come in?

33:15.840 --> 33:16.920
You know, I don't want to trouble you.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
It's not any trouble at all.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.289
I'm sure if she knew you were here,
she'd come right back, you know?

33:22.040 --> 33:23.041
For your sake.

33:23.280 --> 33:24.280
I'm sorry?

33:24.360 --> 33:26.328
It's just that you traveled all this way.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.960
You might as well come in.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.087
No.

33:30.760 --> 33:31.761
Right?

33:32.320 --> 33:33.481
Yeah, okay.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.408
- She just left, you said?
- Yeah.

33:38.480 --> 33:39.561
She shouldn't be long.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.160
Um, actually, it's late.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.765
I'm just gonna call her tomorrow.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.360
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.680
Go, Maggie. Go.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.240
All right.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.321
Good night.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.371
Help us!

34:05.920 --> 34:07.001
Help!

34:14.600 --> 34:15.647
Warm night.

34:17.800 --> 34:18.801
<i>911...</i>

34:43.159 --> 34:45.841
He killed her, didn't he?

34:47.120 --> 34:48.485
We have to get out of here.

34:52.639 --> 34:56.808
Okay, if we can get the lock open,
we can find a phone and call the police.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.207
Glover?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.371
We can't call the police.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.245
They cut the phone lines.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.449
I left my cell in the other bedroom.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.840
Holy shit, man!
What the fuck happened out there?

35:22.480 --> 35:24.050
I told you not to let her leave.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.123
I didn't say cut her fucking throat.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.810
She was just gonna walk, man!

35:32.880 --> 35:34.166
What do you think is going on here?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.320
We broke into this house.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.606
We took those kids.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.920
Cops come, and we're staring at 25 to life,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.207
whether this bitch is dead
or tied up in the basement.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.320
Moms didn't show.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.480
I had to make a call, so I made it.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.802
I didn't bring you on to make fucking calls.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.445
Those kids upstairs,

35:57.280 --> 35:58.566
that's all Mom cares about.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.167
She would never do anything
to risk their lives.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.281
She was afraid,

36:04.040 --> 36:06.361
and that put us in control.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.680
Now, any question that she might
have about our intentions is gone.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.603
And that makes her fucking desperate.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.040
So, what?

36:16.120 --> 36:17.770
So, fear, I can manage.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.087
Desperation, whole different thing.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.324
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.681
Of course, you don't.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.360
From now on, just do as you're fucking told.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.763
From now on, I'm gonna do
what I gotta do to get mine.

36:32.800 --> 36:36.202
We have less than an hour before
the security company calls the cops.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.285
If we don't find that safe,
nothing else matters, right?

36:39.840 --> 36:40.921
What about Peter?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.888
We find the safe, then we find Pete.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.247
And Mom?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.201
Did you understand a word I just said?

36:52.360 --> 36:53.725
Clean up your fucking mess.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.731
You want the arms or the legs?

37:47.160 --> 37:48.321
Come on.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.601
I think I got it.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.480
Ow!

37:58.560 --> 38:00.563
Shit. This isn't working.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.560
We'll keep trying, okay?

38:03.640 --> 38:05.643
Just see if you can find something smaller.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.564
What happens if they find the safe?

38:14.800 --> 38:15.881
Where is it?

38:17.800 --> 38:19.643
Okay, what is this place? Fuck!

38:27.520 --> 38:28.681
Fuck!

38:29.520 --> 38:30.567
Shit.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.600
What?

39:43.680 --> 39:45.523
Maybe the information I got was bad.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.525
Maybe there is no money.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.001
The old man was under
investigation by the DA.

39:51.760 --> 39:52.920
Liquidated all his cash.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.680
You don't do that
unless you're gonna keep it.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.761
I know.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.764
But maybe the assistant was lying.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.600
Maybe she was trying to impress me.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.161
Somehow, I doubt that.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.400
You know what I'm saying.

40:04.520 --> 40:05.567
We did our homework.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.960
The money's here.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.525
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.564
Yeah, you're fucking telling me.
What is it? What do you want?

40:14.120 --> 40:16.407
He's a fucking psycho.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.880
Don't worry about him.

40:17.960 --> 40:19.325
Until he slits my throat, right?

40:19.720 --> 40:21.609
Look, he killed that woman out there.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.010
Now, if I'm Mom, I'm thinking...

40:24.320 --> 40:27.051
I'm thinking no matter what I do,
I'm gonna be dead, too.

40:27.440 --> 40:32.000
So, maybe I stay, before.
But now, I know I gotta go get help.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.571
Moms don't run.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.008
Not when their babies
are trapped in the nest.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.888
Okay, look, you came to me.
You needed a crew.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.721
Now, it's your turn.

40:43.040 --> 40:46.328
So, go find the safe,
and stop wasting my fucking time.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.481
Okay?

41:11.160 --> 41:12.730
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.366
Yo, Eddie!

41:32.560 --> 41:34.164
Oh!

41:34.480 --> 41:35.527
Holy shit!

41:37.680 --> 41:39.364
She's shooting at us!

41:50.080 --> 41:51.081
Is that Mom?

41:55.920 --> 41:57.047
Those weren't gunshots.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.640
She took out the lights.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.563
We should've killed them
the moment they walked in here.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.641
Here she comes.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.521
Find her.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.241
Where's the breaker box?

42:10.480 --> 42:11.720
Back entry.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.407
Go.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.406
Come on. Come on.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.685
What the hell?

43:39.600 --> 43:40.886
That bitch.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.601
Shit.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.921
Son of a bitch.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.360
Yeah, get back here.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.365
She's in the house.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.520
Okay.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.250
Wait, wait, wait. Wait here.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.290
- I'm gonna go get my phone.
- No!

47:36.800 --> 47:38.723
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Please?

47:39.640 --> 47:42.291
Glov, I'll be back, okay?

47:43.560 --> 47:45.369
What if something happens to you?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.286
I'm your big sister.

47:50.160 --> 47:54.050
It's my job to worry about you,
not your job to worry about me.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.766
Whatever, freak.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.323
Phone, phone. Where's my phone?

49:08.960 --> 49:11.611
It's me, baby.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

49:11.920 --> 49:13.480
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.760
- Glover? Did they hurt you?
- He's in the other room, Mom.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.729
- I'm so scared.
- I know, baby.

49:17.880 --> 49:19.160
What are we gonna do?

49:19.240 --> 49:22.050
We're gonna get your brother and we're gonna
get the hell out of this house, okay?

49:24.000 --> 49:25.331
Okay, okay.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.650
Was that them? Are they coming?

49:37.080 --> 49:38.810
- They're gonna kill us, Mom.
- No, no, no.

49:39.280 --> 49:41.080
I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?

49:41.160 --> 49:42.280
- Mom...
- No, no, no.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.805
- I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Shaun?

49:50.440 --> 49:52.240
What if they can't get the safe open?

49:52.320 --> 49:55.130
If they can't get what they want,
why would they let us go?

49:55.440 --> 49:57.522
What do you mean,
"If they can't open the safe"?

49:58.160 --> 49:59.366
That's what they said.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.165
- Shaun!
- Are you sure?

50:13.320 --> 50:16.005
All right, all right. You got it?

50:17.080 --> 50:19.200
Mom. Mom, you can't leave us.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.320
Baby, I promise you,
it'll be just for a little while.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.840
Mom, no. There has to be another way.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.923
Jas, listen to me. There is no other way.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.800
You gotta take care of your brother, okay?

50:26.880 --> 50:28.848
- Mom, I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.160
You hear me? You can.

50:31.480 --> 50:33.722
Baby, you are strong, you're smart.

50:33.840 --> 50:36.127
You are everything
I could have ever hoped for.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.561
You're my daughter. You can do this.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.645
Come on, Jas.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.051
Where's your sister?

53:02.640 --> 53:03.801
Hello?

53:05.920 --> 53:06.921
Eddie?

53:47.960 --> 53:50.281
Tell me the kids are still
locked in the bedroom.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.327
Where is she?

54:13.200 --> 54:14.361
Where is she?

54:15.280 --> 54:16.441
I don't know.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.360
She was in the house, God damn it.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.010
- Tell me where the fuck she is.
- I'm sorry.

54:24.520 --> 54:25.520
I'm sorry.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.761
All I have to do is push.

54:26.920 --> 54:28.445
- Don't!
- Wait, wait, wait. Please.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.490
Please, don't hurt us.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.210
I'll tell you where the safe is.

55:09.120 --> 55:12.329
You knew this was here the whole time,

55:13.160 --> 55:15.402
and you're just telling us about it now.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.171
Not exactly.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.643
My mom told me where it was.

55:25.080 --> 55:27.128
Did she happen to tell you the combination?

55:28.200 --> 55:29.406
No.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.289
But she wants you guys
to stop trashing the place.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.441
Hello?

55:55.960 --> 55:58.042
Nice. You found the safe.

56:04.920 --> 56:05.921
What?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.127
All right.

56:16.920 --> 56:18.160
Let's go for a walk.

56:22.720 --> 56:23.920
We'll use the kids.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.286
Take 'em to the porch.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.842
Kill the boy, and Mom will fall in line.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.082
No fucking way, man.
We're not killing fucking kids.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.240
You didn't have a problem
killing the old man, did you?

56:33.320 --> 56:34.520
That was different.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.240
Why? Because you weren't driving the car?

56:36.320 --> 56:38.720
No. Because if the DA had investigated him
and he told them about the safe,

56:38.800 --> 56:40.560
this whole thing would've been blown.
We didn't have a choice.

56:40.640 --> 56:42.320
Thirty fucking minutes,
then the cops show up.

56:42.400 --> 56:44.880
Either we do what's gotta be done,
or we turn ourselves in.

56:45.120 --> 56:46.960
Why would she tell us where the safe is?

56:47.040 --> 56:48.326
Who fucking cares?

56:48.960 --> 56:52.564
She's smart, knows how to handle herself.

56:56.440 --> 56:57.851
She knows about Peter.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.171
Hello, Shaun.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.929
<i>You find what you were looking for?</i>

57:26.760 --> 57:28.000
I did.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.524
<i>Tree line. Side of the house.</i>

57:43.400 --> 57:44.401
There she is.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.880
Gotta say, I didn't think
you'd make it this far.

57:50.960 --> 57:52.690
Yeah. You and everybody else.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.969
Growing up in this house.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.920
The man your father was.

57:58.640 --> 57:59.721
Guess I was wrong.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.124
Still, you must be wondering
if I'm capable of killing this man.

58:03.680 --> 58:06.360
And that depends on what you want
and what you're willing to do to get it.

58:06.440 --> 58:09.330
You know exactly what I want.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be standing here.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.121
Where are the other two?

58:12.000 --> 58:13.081
In the house.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.920
You're smarter than that.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.325
Tell them to step out into the light.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.880
You heard the lady.

58:27.320 --> 58:29.766
Now, your friend here,
he's losing a lot of blood.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.680
I don't know if you care about his life,
but I do know that you care

58:32.760 --> 58:34.760
that he's the only one
who knows how to open the safe.

58:34.840 --> 58:36.080
Listen, Shaun,

58:37.640 --> 58:40.564
I want to end this as much as you do.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.001
Great.

58:42.520 --> 58:46.285
You tell my children to come outside,
and you don't touch them.

58:46.960 --> 58:49.042
We'll walk into the woods,
and you don't follow.

58:49.480 --> 58:50.811
When we're in the clear,

58:51.920 --> 58:53.126
I'll let him go.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.720
And how do I know I can trust you?

58:57.800 --> 58:58.801
You don't.

58:59.120 --> 59:00.929
But you know you'll do
whatever you have to do

59:01.400 --> 59:03.323
because there's nothing else you can do.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.287
You're a man at the mercy of a woman whose

59:08.080 --> 59:10.686
greatest weakness has
a fucking saw to his throat.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.447
Let her go.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.971
Keep running, Shaun!

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.284
You just killed your kids.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.890
Their blood is on your hands!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.370
The assistant kept encrypted copies
of his codes at her apartment.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.210
Peter runs a dummy protocol.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.450
Peter wrote a new code
that'll bypass the safe security lock.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.371
Theoretically.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.011
How long is this gonna take?

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.846
Thirty seconds.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.441
If it works.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.126
We're in.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.566
So, that's what the American
dream looks like.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.641
Bag it.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.171
Tie the kids to their beds.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.160
Light the house on fire.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.130
Just another family tragedy.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.287
Hey.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.363
To be honest, I don't like this
any more than you do.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.489
But it has to be done.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.642
And that bag you're holding
means life without worry,

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.291
from here on out.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.811
No more 12-hour shifts.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.360
No more sucking up
to those rich motherfuckers

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.283
who think they're better than you are.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.211
No more being on your knees.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.047
Don't look at them.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.491
They don't matter. Look at me.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.246
I said, look at me.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.527
We good?

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.966
All right, let's get this done.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.930
The fuck was that?

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.563
This bitch doesn't know when to give up.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.367
Stay here.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.161
You find her.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.969
You cut her in fucking half.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.091
Screw this bitch.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.081
Shut up!

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.401
Shut up.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.280
Shut up!

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.320
I said, shut up!

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.401
I'm coming.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.608
Mama's coming. Mommy's coming, okay?

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.524
I'll be right there. I'll be right back.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.440
Going somewhere?

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.688
No. I was just...

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.167
You were what?

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.329
There was... A noise.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.881
Where?

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.090
I'm gonna drop the rope down, okay?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.201
I'm gonna drop the rope down.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.643
There's nowhere left to go.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.127
Shit.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.250
No, you... You don't have to do this.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.725
The first time is the hardest.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.571
You got what you came here for.
Just... You can just leave.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:29.361
She's right.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.290
There's no reason she has to die.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.085
They all gotta die.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.760
Go! Go!

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.966
You're not a killer.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.046
You don't want to do this.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.484
- Please.
- I don't know, man.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.680
Do it, or you're fucking next.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.285
Go, Glover, hurry.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.249
Let me go!

01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.921
Stop!

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.571
Last chance.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720
Yeah.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:06.481
All right.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:12.685
Relax, kid.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.765
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.045
"We tie the kids to their beds.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.240
"Light the house on fire"?

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:22.885
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already.

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:26.729
I wanna get you out of this,
but you're gonna have to trust me.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.086
So, just relax, okay? Give me...

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.961
Give me the gun.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.206
Put the gun down.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.291
- Shoot him!
- Give me the gun.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.370
- Shoot him!
- Give me the gun.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.924
Jasmine! Glover!

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.521
Jas!

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.041
Mom!

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.961
Mom!

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.481
Keep running!

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.807
Go! Go!

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.645
Keep going! Run!

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.445
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.161
We're almost there!

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.929
Okay, get in. Go, Glov, hurry.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.366
Put your head down, Glov.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.121
Get down.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.041
Mom!

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.881
Oh, God!

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:26.921
Get down!

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.205
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.964
Mom... Mom, front door.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.650
Okay. Come on, come on!

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.087
Mom?

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.000
They got what they came here for.
They got their money.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.844
- They're gonna leave us alone.
- Mom.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.721
Mom...

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.280
I'm gonna get in the house, Shaun!

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360
Okay, okay, come on.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.010
I will get in that house!

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.247
We're safe now, okay? We're okay, now.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.449
Okay. We're safe.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.321
Okay.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.681
Mom?

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.610
Just stay here, okay?

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:38.729
Oh, no. No.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.200
No!

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.362
Justin. No, baby, no.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.961
Shaun?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.161
- Shaun!
- No!

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.081
Justin!

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.320
- Shaun?
- No!

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.080
- Shaun! Shaun! Open the door!
- Run! Run!

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.446
Open the door. What is going on?

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.570
- Open the door.
- It's been a hell of a night.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.121
So, where are the keys?

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.529
Who are you? What do you want?

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.080
- Justin...
- Where are the keys?

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.161
My wife...

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.649
- Daddy?
- Kids, get back!

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:31.407
I know you can hear me.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:35.044
Obviously, you can see me.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.725
Open the door,

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.961
or I'm going to kill your husband
in front of you and your fucking kids.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.250
You don't want to see him die.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.843
Don't do it, Shaun! Don't listen to him!

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.964
Look, you're an impressive woman.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:55.725
You've done everything you can.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.081
You've done enough.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.887
Mom. Mom, just give him the money.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.480
He's gonna kill us anyway.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.971
You don't know that, Mom. You don't know.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.360
You gotta get outta here.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.128
You gotta take Glover,
you gotta run as fast as you can.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.765
- What?
- You run as fast as you can,

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.848
and you don't stop for anyone,
do you understand me?

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.242
Mom... Mom, what are you gonna do?

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.611
Open the goddamn door!

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.450
Don't you hurt my family!

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.888
I know what you're trying to do, Shaun.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.810
This isn't gonna work.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.280
You're done!

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:52.562
So, your plan was to draw me upstairs,

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.250
set the house on fire.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.560
Sounds like something your dad
might have thought of.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.046
Good plan.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:04.404
The money is doused in gasoline.

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.564
You come any closer and I'll burn it.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.884
You do that, you and your kids are dead.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.403
And you walk away with nothing.

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.087
Or, I could just shoot you.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.321
And the money burns.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.522
After all this, is that what you want?

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.001
Shaun...

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.848
How far do you think your kids will get?

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.771
Your husband?

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.120
Now, you want me to believe
that you're capable

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.887
of letting your entire family die,
just so I don't get what I want.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:47.210
After tonight, it's quite clear you have
no fucking clue what I'm capable of.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.282
Me and everybody else, right?

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.327
Glover, wait. Wait.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.167
Dad.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.841
Drop it.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.811
I meant what I said.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.000
You're an impressive woman.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.844
No. I'm not.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.280
I'm just a mom.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.404
Now, get the fuck out of my house.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.321
He had it coming.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.528
See, I was walking back here, thinking,

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.763
"Even though this bitch ran me over,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.889
"see, I'm gonna make it quick."

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.485
That boy, too.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.005
It ain't his fault.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.686
But now, your girl...

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.484
See, I might have some fun with her.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.001
Now, I'm thinking,

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.490
let's make it a family affair.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.930
Where do you think you're going?

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.567
Daddy. Daddy?

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.802
Let go! Let go!

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.771
All night, trying to get back
into this house to save your kids,

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.328
only to end up trapped inside with me.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.329
I wish I had a mother like you.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.045
- Get up here.
- No, please.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.401
Don't fight me.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.522
Please, don't. No.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.489
- Hold still.
- Please, don't.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.001
- Relax.
- No.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.121
No, you don't have to do this.
You don't have to...

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.720
- It'll be okay. Relax.
- Please.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.640
- All I wanna do is push.
- Please. Please don't!

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.881
No! Please.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.481
Just hold still, huh?

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.484
I do what I can to protect my kids.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.449
- Do you have something to say?
- Yeah.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.563
You broke into the wrong fucking house.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.245
Come here, baby. Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.366
- Shaun?
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.530
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.042
We're okay. We're okay now.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.611
We're okay.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:56.927
I'm okay.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.047
I'm okay.
