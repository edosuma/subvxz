Look at that cute baby!
That's me, Elle Evans.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.446
And the smelly, less-cute baby right
next to me? That's my best friend Lee.

00:29.821 --> 00:33.158
Lee and I were born on the same day,
at the same time,

00:33.241 --> 00:34.868
here in Los Angeles, California.

00:35.243 --> 00:38.747
Our moms were BFFs before people
even used the term "BFF,"

00:38.872 --> 00:40.290
so we were raised like twins

00:40.373 --> 00:43.126
and we've been pretty much
inseparable ever since.

Let me get you up to speed.
First Christmas I remember, I was six.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.490
I got a Barbie dance party.
Lee got a scooter.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.933
Broke my leg riding Lee's scooter.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.578
Had my cast signed by Lee, who bought me
ice cream to make up for breaking my leg.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.414
Dressed as a cowboy for Halloween,
Lee went as a doctor.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.666
Learned how to ride a bike,
learned how to swim.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.628
Got protected by Lee's older brother Noah,

01:26.711 --> 01:28.963
who chased off some bullies
who were hassling us.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.632
Had to pay protection tax, though.

Lee went as some weird bird.

01:51.611 --> 01:53.279
Found out that my mom was sick.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.991
Went to visit her in the hospital
for the first time.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.994
Tried to get used to seeing her there.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.556

Made up with Noah
by letting him fix my bike.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.628
He is so handy!

02:09.711 --> 02:12.090
Got my first bra. Didn't really need it.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.424
Discovered I like soccer.

Discovered I am good at sports.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.405
Had a tough talk with Dad.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.365
Sat with mom in the hospital.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.868
I tried to help her put makeup on.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.744
Not much help.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.203
Hey...

02:44.497 --> 02:45.857
Held her hand a long time.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.252
Only cried when she was asleep.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.338
Tried to score my first kiss
with Randy Melrose.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.424
Wasn't exactly a love connection.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.885
Watched Noah getting really, really cute!

02:56.968 --> 02:59.304

03:01.431 --> 03:03.057
Went as a pirate for Halloween.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.125
Got a bra I suddenly did need!

03:29.209 --> 03:32.003
Wondered why I still hadn't been
kissed yet or even been on a date.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.504
No big deal, I guess.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.673
Realized I had a crush on Noah.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.300

of summer at Lee's totally awesome house.

It's moments like this that make me wish
things could stay this way forever.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.080
Ew! Perv!

04:07.163 --> 04:10.875
Hey, Lee, guess what Warren

is expecting our dance club idea

04:39.028 --> 04:41.197

Noah Flynn is stupid hot,

04:57.547 --> 05:00.341
but Lee and I developed
a list of friendship rules.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.802
Lee was responsible for Rule Number Nine,

05:03.219 --> 05:05.847
which specifically states,
"relatives of your best friend

05:06.264 --> 05:08.057
are totally off-limits."

05:08.182 --> 05:10.101
This is a really big one for Lee.

05:10.184 --> 05:13.855
I guess it comes from living
in the shadow of a high school legend.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.857
Lee, you seen my athletic cup?

05:16.399 --> 05:17.399
Yes, asshat.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.154

I'm constantly playing, you know?

05:33.875 --> 05:36.315
When you were at football camp
learning to be a better douche.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.630
It was almost like she was
on human growth hormones or something.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.592
Lee! Rule Number Two, please!

05:42.675 --> 05:45.636

Never share our secrets with anyone else.

Friday night, so party starts at eight.

- Dry cleaners.
- Your back-up back-ups?

- These are my back-up back-ups!
- All right! Don't get so upset!

11:00.409 --> 11:03.329

my lady-bump.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.166

but I also, unfortunately,
must punish you.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.761
- Elle!
- What?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.304
You only broke the dress code.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.472
That's all.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.433
Detention tomorrow.

11:34.694 --> 11:39.073
♪ Say yeah, say yea h ♪

11:39.198 --> 11:41.200
♪ Say yeah ♪

11:41.325 --> 11:43.327
♪ Say yeah... ♪

11:47.123 --> 11:48.624
Oh, my God!

11:48.708 --> 11:50.292
How crazy was that fight?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.877
Flynn was so savage!

11:52.420 --> 11:54.004
Have you made out with him yet?

11:54.755 --> 11:57.717
These three super-popular juniors
are kind of package deal.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.010
I call them the OMG Girls.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.180
Olivia, Mia, and Gwyneth.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.433
And I have no idea
why they're sitting with me.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.851
Oh, my God.

12:06.934 --> 12:09.603
I would totally have babies with Noah.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.480
One girl, one boy.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.566
But not at the same time though.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.984
Mm-mmm.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.195
Yeah, you don't really get to pick
the gender so much.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.157
I hear he's into blondes. Too bad, Elle.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.577
Give me your numerals.
We should def catch up.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.996
Okay, yeah! It's 310...

12:27.079 --> 12:28.079
Oh, my God.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.249
Oooh.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.375
Got to go, Elle.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.502
There's a shemergency
in the locker room.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.254
Oh, okay.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.757
Sorry it didn't work out
with you and Noah.

12:37.840 --> 12:38.960
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

12:41.260 --> 12:45.389
What just happened? And why were
the OMG Girls being so nice to me?

12:45.931 --> 12:48.684
But more importantly,
when did they eat those?

12:51.812 --> 12:53.314
- Was that Mia?
- Did you see that?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.542
She say anything about me?
You tell her about my dimples?

12:55.566 --> 12:56.776
What did she smell like today?

12:56.859 --> 13:00.780
Sometimes she smells like apples
or kind of like blueberry-coconut fusion.

13:02.907 --> 13:03.907
What?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.236
What are you doing anyway?

13:12.541 --> 13:15.461
I am trying to find a good idea
for our carnival fundraiser.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.797
Somebody has to.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.299
Come on.

13:20.382 --> 13:23.427
What about the strength game, the one
with the sledgehammer and the bell?

13:23.511 --> 13:26.764
Yeah, the chess team picked that one.
I know.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.951
What about... Ooh!
What about a dunking booth?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.852
- Swimming team picked it.
- Damn it!

13:32.478 --> 13:34.814
I know, dude! Who saw that one coming?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.943
Okay, do you think Mia
would like this one?

13:39.026 --> 13:42.488
Because I think it makes my eyes pop,
and I really want to kiss her on Friday.

13:42.571 --> 13:46.033
Come on! Today was the first time
the OMGs ever spoke to me.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.702
Do you really think Mia knows who you are?

13:50.079 --> 13:52.832
Baby steps, Elle. Baby steps.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.835
Lee, come on. She's a varsity cheerleader.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.672
Basically, the only way she'd ever
make out with you is if you paid for it.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.760
- Kissing booth!
- Kissing booth!

14:04.844 --> 14:07.346
Oh, that is the perfect
carnival fundraiser!

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
Yes! Oh, also,

14:09.974 --> 14:13.727
I love the irony. The girl who's never
been kissed does a kissing booth? What?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.480
Yes, irony is a cruel mistress indeed.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.457
Okay, well, now all we need
is the student council to approve it.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.110
Yes. Don't worry. Leave that to me.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.070
Okay. Wait.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.365
What about this one?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.284
Mia will love it.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.079
- Really?
- No, dude! It's awful!

14:32.538 --> 14:33.538
Dammit!

14:38.669 --> 14:39.669
Psst.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.108
Psst.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.506
Psst.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.611
Plus, that whole skirt thing
was priceless!

16:27.695 --> 16:30.739
If word gets out that fighting me
is a way of getting your number,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.033
I am in for a super long junior year.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.577
Oh, I wouldn't really call it a fight.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.745
Mmm.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.165
I think I'm gonna go out with Tuppen.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.210
- Unless you think I shouldn't.
- No, actually, I think you should.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.171
You're gonna have to go on a date
eventually.

16:46.296 --> 16:47.214
- Right?
- You know?

16:47.297 --> 16:48.297
So?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.154
God, what do people even do on dates?

16:50.718 --> 16:53.220

That is just fine.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.993
Okay, listen. Can you just
keep your phone on you?

17:17.077 --> 17:20.122
Because I know myself and I'm gonna
run out of things to talk about

17:20.204 --> 17:22.249
- and I really want to call you...
- No.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.126
- I know myself.
- No! Do not call me.

17:24.209 --> 17:27.296
Okay? If he can't see
how completely baller you are,

17:28.547 --> 17:30.090
Then he's not the right guy for you.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.178
Oh! You can be so sweet
when you want to be.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.471
Oh, I know!

17:38.932 --> 17:39.932
Kill it.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.728
- Okay, thank you for driving me.
- Totally.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.438
- Love you. Bye!
- Love you.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.399
Have a good time!
But not too good of a time!

18:04.666 --> 18:06.168
God! What is wrong with me?

18:07.002 --> 18:08.002
Is my butt too big?

18:08.712 --> 18:10.380
Am I some sort of freak or something?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.466
No! You're awesome, all right?

18:12.549 --> 18:16.011
Tuppen is just a dick. I don't know why
I told you to go out with him.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.639
Maybe because he's the only guy
that's ever asked me out.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.642
Stop it, all right? Tuppen isn't worth it.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.227
You're way too good for him.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.314
Plus I heard he's got like, three nipples.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.400
Just saying.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.903
Thanks for doing this for me.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.280
Are you kidding me? I live for this shit.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.996
Alrighty. Hit the road.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.874
You had your shot.
Keep on moving, bud.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.751
I need to talk to Elle.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.669
Lee, it's okay.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.008
So,

18:56.510 --> 18:58.387
running a bit late now, are we?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.140
Look. I'm sorry I stood you up.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.433
I really did want to go out with you.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.978
I just thought you deserve
a little bit of an explanation.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.230
That would be nice.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.441
Flynn...

19:11.942 --> 19:14.778
told me that it wouldn't be smart
if I showed up for our date tonight.

19:15.904 --> 19:16.738
Noah?

19:16.822 --> 19:17.823
Yeah.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.950
That literally makes no sense.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.035
It's true, and it's not just me.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.997
He's been going around
telling all the guys not to ask you out

19:25.080 --> 19:26.080
for a while now.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.790
What?

19:28.041 --> 19:29.168
Shit.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.251
There's others?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.879
You can't tell him I told you.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.130
Why do you care?

19:33.213 --> 19:36.091
No boobs are worth a broken nose.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.385
Fine!

19:38.468 --> 19:39.595
I got to go.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.388
Go! Whatever!

19:41.471 --> 19:42.471
Leave!

19:42.514 --> 19:46.018
But just so you know,
my boobs are fantastic!

19:46.602 --> 19:48.687
Yes, some would even say breathtaking!

19:55.903 --> 19:56.904
Shit.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.364
You do realize
that you're not my dad, right?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.283
Look, you still got a lot to learn, kiddo.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.745
Kiddo? Oh, my God.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.539
Oh, if you were here,
I would beat you with my shoe,

20:07.623 --> 20:08.749
Tuppen is a player.

20:08.832 --> 20:09.875
So are you!

20:09.958 --> 20:12.044
And that's why I know he's wrong for you.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.755
- You're gonna thank me one day.
- Okay.

20:14.838 --> 20:16.590
Well, today is not that day.

20:16.673 --> 20:20.844
It is not your job to monitor
my dating life. Do you understand me?

20:20.928 --> 20:23.931
The days of you controlling my life
are over!

20:25.724 --> 20:26.808
We'll see about that.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.736
Next proposal is from the dance club.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.197
Elle Evans and Lee Flynn.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.532
You have an accent.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.371
Sorry.
I thought that was gonna be funnier.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.207
And what is your idea for the fundraiser?

20:50.999 --> 20:52.459
Um...

20:52.584 --> 20:53.584
Sorry.

20:53.961 --> 20:54.878
Okay.

20:54.962 --> 20:59.007
We have an idea that we think
everyone will be very excited about.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.511
But first, we want to thank you
for your time

21:02.594 --> 21:04.096
and ask that you withold any...

21:04.179 --> 21:05.347
Kissing booth!

21:09.059 --> 21:11.228
Yeah, we want to do a kissing booth.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.229
Hmm.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.694
Okay, I think I speak for everyone

21:18.777 --> 21:21.363
when I say kissing is the number one cause

21:21.446 --> 21:23.657
of all germs, cavities,

21:23.740 --> 21:25.284
shingles, gingivitis,

21:25.367 --> 21:27.035
- cold sores...
- Ew.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.829
Uh, it would be totally voluntary.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.124
And no tongue,
because we're not the French.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.251
Most of us.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.004
I'm British, you wanker!

21:37.087 --> 21:38.463
Excuse me,

21:38.547 --> 21:41.758
- but would you be working the booth?
- Me?

21:43.051 --> 21:44.428
No.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.929
We're just the organizers.

21:46.013 --> 21:50.684
But I can assure you,
we have some real A-listers lined up.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.269
You can count on that.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.688
Would Flynn be working the kissing booth?

21:54.813 --> 21:56.690
Ha! Noah?

21:56.773 --> 21:59.544
You'd have a better chance getting
Miley Cyrus to become a nun...

21:59.568 --> 22:01.778
Absolutely! No, Flynn
will be working the booth.

22:02.112 --> 22:05.699
I promise. Flynn will be there.

22:09.911 --> 22:10.911
Hmph.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.542
You're about to witness
a family tradition.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.210
For as long as I can remember,

22:17.669 --> 22:20.339
we've had lunch with the Flynns
every Sunday.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.716
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

22:22.799 --> 22:24.176
That's Mrs. Flynn.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.844
She's sort of a surrogate mom to me.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.138
I couldn't have made it through the years
without her.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.097
How's school going?

22:31.099 --> 22:32.601
Let's just say, "interesting."

22:33.143 --> 22:36.980
I don't know what that means, but I want
to hear all the gory details later.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
Hey.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.526
Hi.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.610
Hi there.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.782
- And how's my favorite little man?
- I'm okay.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.786
Hey, Noah! I haven't seen you
since you got back from football camp.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.496
They got you starting again?

22:52.579 --> 22:55.832
Well... he'll be lucky if he makes it
through the season.

22:56.458 --> 22:59.753
He goes and gets into a fight
on the first day of school.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.880
Really? What happened?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.506
Tell him.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.886
Here it comes.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.016
It was just an argument over something
that happened at football camp.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.977
Excuse me.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.024
Wonder why he didn't say anything.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.653
Our booth is going to kick ass
at the carnival.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.072
Oh, and news update:

23:27.155 --> 23:30.075
Mia stopped me in the hall and said
that she's going to the party tonight.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.828
She wanted to make sure
that I would be there.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.248
Well, sir, I wish you
the best of luck with that.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.042
Oh, I have to go to practice right now.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.877
Can you still give me
a ride afterwards?

23:40.961 --> 23:43.880
Oh, I can't. I'm taking my parents
to the airport.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.550
But Noah can give you a ride.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.594
Convince him to do the booth.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.514
You're gonna have to ask him
eventually.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.250
We're having a party at my place
tonight if you guys want to come.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.193
My parents aren't going to be home,
so there's gonna be drinks.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.654
- My brother will be there, but you know.
- Hey.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.784
I'll catch you guys later.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.868
Bye.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.370
He's so cute!

24:15.454 --> 24:16.329
Hey.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.373
Lee said that you're gonna give me a ride.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.250
- Yeah.
- Where's your car?

24:24.629 --> 24:26.131
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.216
Look, I have a spare helmet.
You'll be fine.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.803
I'm not gonna get on that thing
like one of your make-out girls.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.167
They don't all make out with me.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.601
Okay, so like,

24:37.684 --> 24:40.937
95% of them make out with me, but that is
clearly not what's happening here,

24:41.021 --> 24:43.106
so if you could just
get on the damned bike please.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.817
It's so beautiful outside,
I think I'm gonna go for a run.

24:45.901 --> 24:48.111
- Are you serious? It's like five miles.
- What?

24:48.195 --> 24:50.363
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry. Can't hear you.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.115
I'll see you at the party, okay?

24:52.199 --> 24:54.576
No, you won't. I told you not to come.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.369
Better get used to disappointment!

24:56.453 --> 24:58.205

I really want to pull this off.

You see? I told you she'd come.

Hey, Ellen! Come here!

26:10.110 --> 26:12.904

Yeah, for sure.

Hey!

Hey, girl!

26:21.955 --> 26:23.373
What's Gucci?

26:25.166 --> 26:26.960
You will love this.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.253
Tastes like green.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.255
Oh, no, I really don't drink.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.590
Just shoot it, girl!

26:31.673 --> 26:33.216
Go!

26:33.550 --> 26:34.551
Get it, girl.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.677
- Mmm!
- Ooh.

26:36.219 --> 26:39.055
Wow! That does taste like green!

26:39.139 --> 26:40.557
I know, right?

26:41.766 --> 26:42.892
So have you asked him yet?

26:43.310 --> 26:44.144
Asked who?

26:44.227 --> 26:45.687
Flynn, silly!

26:46.771 --> 26:47.981
About the booth.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.775
Oh, he looks busy.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.027
You're funny!

26:52.110 --> 26:53.987
I love this hoe!

26:54.070 --> 26:55.280
I love you!

26:55.363 --> 26:56.698
- Go!
- Go!

26:56.781 --> 26:58.283
- Right now?
- Go!

26:59.367 --> 27:00.368
Okay!

27:00.452 --> 27:01.870
Yes, honey! Get it!

27:10.545 --> 27:11.838
I haven't seen Lee.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.384
What?

27:16.468 --> 27:19.763
The OMG Girls want to know
if you'll do our kissing booth.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.056
No.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.602
Okay, you win, Noah.
You want me to wash your motorcycle?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.854
Polish your trophies?

27:29.147 --> 27:30.982
Did you just put hands on me?

27:31.066 --> 27:33.193
Easybake Oven is downstairs, bitch!

27:34.778 --> 27:37.364
Okay, you should probably leave.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.447
What?

27:39.282 --> 27:43.286
She's like important to my family,
which kind of makes her important to me.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.622
Are you for serious?

27:46.164 --> 27:47.164
Leave.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.840
Uh, sorry I ruined your make-out sesh.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.469
Oh, it's fine.
She kind of tasted like Cheetos anyway.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.346
That's gross.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.140
So...

28:04.474 --> 28:05.809
Kissing booth?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.435
Absolutely not.

28:08.144 --> 28:08.978
Awesome.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.690
Oh, my God! That was so savage!

28:11.773 --> 28:13.817
- That girl totally left!
- Yeah.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.860
You'll love this.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.944
Tastes like pink.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.571
Ooh!

28:18.697 --> 28:20.490
So, Flynn's still doing the booth?

28:22.075 --> 28:23.368
Between us girls,

28:24.911 --> 28:28.289

happens when you mess with me.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.311
You're holding it completely wrong. Just...

28:50.395 --> 28:53.314
Warren! Can you just play the game?
I know how to hold a controller.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.567

29:27.307 --> 29:28.349
It's hot out here!

29:29.017 --> 29:30.560
- Dude!
- Oh, no

29:30.643 --> 29:31.770
I'm totally dying.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.688
No!

29:33.772 --> 29:34.772
I'm taking this off.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.608
- I bet you she does. I bet you.
- No.

29:36.691 --> 29:37.776
Who cares?

29:45.158 --> 29:47.285
We should go skinny dipping!

29:47.368 --> 29:50.246
- Absolutely!
- Yearbook!

29:50.330 --> 29:52.165
- Yeah!
- Dude, let's do it!

29:53.082 --> 29:54.083
Woo!

29:59.672 --> 30:00.924
Okay...

30:03.760 --> 30:05.470
Here I come. I'm gonna...

30:06.596 --> 30:11.184
Who is this? Are you... are you
a girl princess or a boy princess?

30:12.227 --> 30:13.561
You smell good.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.163
Oh, my God!

30:33.873 --> 30:34.916
Oh, my God!

30:35.875 --> 30:37.126
Oh, my God!

30:38.336 --> 30:39.629
I'm in Noah's t-shirt!

30:41.422 --> 30:42.632
Oh, no!

30:43.299 --> 30:45.468
Dress is missing
but underwear is still on.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.304
Okay. We can work with that.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.732
Oh, sweet mercy!

31:01.025 --> 31:02.025
Sorry.

31:02.902 --> 31:03.902
It's okay.

31:04.237 --> 31:07.240
I didn't mean to wake you.
I was just grabbing some clothes.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.660
So, how bad was I?

31:11.661 --> 31:14.789
You were about to strip on the pool table
in front of a bunch of guys

31:15.206 --> 31:16.374
and then go skinny dipping.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.335
I carried you out
before too much came off.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.255
Oh, and you threw up on your dress.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.383
Noah, I am so sorry.

31:25.800 --> 31:30.263
It's okay. But I mean, this is exactly
what I was talking about, Shelly.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.473
Oh, this is so embarrassing!

31:33.933 --> 31:36.019
Oh, I hope I didn't snore.

31:37.770 --> 31:38.855
Elle, I...

31:39.439 --> 31:41.274
I slept in the guest room.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.236
Oh, yeah.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.238
Of course.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.322
Okay.

31:49.449 --> 31:53.745
I am assuming the t-shirt means
you saw me in my underwear?

31:53.828 --> 31:55.663
- Yep.
- Oh, my God.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.458
Oh, my God! Okay!

32:00.126 --> 32:01.377
Shorts, please!

32:01.878 --> 32:03.671
Can you... please?

32:05.048 --> 32:06.048
Noah!

32:07.634 --> 32:08.927
- Noah!
- All right, fine.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.261
I'll just get it myself!

32:12.597 --> 32:14.641
- Stop pulling!
- I'm not pulling anything!

32:14.724 --> 32:17.018
Okay, well my arm is caught!
Let me just reach down and...

32:17.101 --> 32:18.603
Oh, my God! I just touched it!

32:18.686 --> 32:19.729
I said stop wiggling!

32:23.107 --> 32:24.107
Sorry!

32:27.278 --> 32:28.780
Aren't you forgetting something?

32:29.697 --> 32:30.697
My t-shirt.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.201
- Your t-shirt. Right. I'm sorry.
- Elle!

32:33.284 --> 32:34.494
- What?
- Jesus!

32:35.036 --> 32:35.870
I was kidding!

32:35.954 --> 32:37.997
- So, I should...
- Just get out, dork.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.083
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.628
Never let me drink again.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.632
It's okay. I got it covered.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.510
Made you an emergency survival kit.

32:50.593 --> 32:56.391
Some granola, sports drinks, antacids,
and an epic dose of awkward shame!

32:56.849 --> 32:57.976
Thank you.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.605
Oh, and... really good work last night.

33:03.398 --> 33:04.607
What do you mean?

33:04.941 --> 33:07.819
You told everybody that Noah and the OMGs

33:07.902 --> 33:09.570
would be doing the kissing booth.

33:12.281 --> 33:13.616
Come on!

33:14.742 --> 33:18.121
And even though I felt
like I was about to puke my liver out,

33:18.538 --> 33:20.707
I couldn't stop thinking about Noah.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.875
Our accidental groping.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.421
It seemed like he just saw me
as a little sister,

33:26.504 --> 33:31.175
but I couldn't help wondering if he had
a different reason for protecting me.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.636
Listen, it's all about the OMGs.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.880
We get them to do the booth,
everyone else will follow.

33:35.930 --> 33:39.058
- Do you want to go over the plan again?
- No, I think I got it.

33:39.559 --> 33:41.269
- Okay, wish me luck!
- Good luck.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.602
Okay!

33:45.440 --> 33:47.567
Have you guys seen this text?

33:52.613 --> 33:53.613
Hey, Ellen!

33:56.075 --> 33:57.118
Hey...

33:58.244 --> 34:00.621
It's "Elle," actually. No "N."

34:00.955 --> 34:04.459
Why are you standing and talking
instead of sitting and talking?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.087
Oh, yeah, okay.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.467
Ask Mia about me!

34:16.012 --> 34:18.723
- Lee wants to know if you like him.
- Flynn's brother?

34:23.728 --> 34:26.481
Yeah, he's cute.
Needs to learn to dress, though.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.400
But more importantly,

34:29.900 --> 34:32.402
everything's set
for the kissing booth, right?

34:33.321 --> 34:36.032
Okay, so here's what I just heard.

34:37.449 --> 34:40.161
Flynn likes one of you. Yeah.

34:40.244 --> 34:44.791
And rumor has it that if the person
he likes is working the booth,

34:44.873 --> 34:46.125
then he'll be there, too.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.172
Wait! Didn't we tell you?

34:52.255 --> 34:53.341
Tell me what?

34:53.424 --> 34:55.301
Now that we're all besties,

34:55.802 --> 34:59.680
we would totally do
the kissing booth, girl. Just for you.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.808
- Really?
- You're one of us now, girl.

35:01.891 --> 35:02.767
Totally!

35:02.850 --> 35:04.268
- Thank you, guys.
- Sure!

35:04.352 --> 35:06.104
You can call us bitches.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
Thank you!

35:09.816 --> 35:10.816
Bitches!

35:11.651 --> 35:12.860
You're welcome!

35:14.028 --> 35:16.114
So we've got a pretty solid line up now,

35:16.197 --> 35:18.616
but we're still down
one Noah Flynn, though.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.076
But let's focus on the booth.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.744
I'm going to make the letters,

35:21.828 --> 35:24.580
and then you are going to make
everything else. Okay?

35:24.664 --> 35:28.709
We're only two days away from the carnival
so we need to move. Chop-chop!

35:28.793 --> 35:30.353
Have I ever told you that you're bossy?

35:30.753 --> 35:33.673
Yes, but then I told you
not to tell me that anymore.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.342
- Ha-ha-ha. You're funny.
- I prefer the term "witty."

35:37.093 --> 35:39.428
- I'm more of a slapstick guy myself.
- Really?

35:42.849 --> 35:45.518
I am sorry. Was that the wrong color?

35:47.019 --> 35:48.020
Oh, you're gonna...

35:56.404 --> 35:58.406
Oh, you're so dead!

36:06.539 --> 36:07.539
Hello.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.811
Holy shit! She looks like
a hot Braveheart!

36:29.353 --> 36:30.646
- You need to leave.
- Stop it!

36:30.730 --> 36:32.315
I told you before, stop messing around.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.816
I'll leave when I want to!

36:34.233 --> 36:35.651
You're not the boss of me, Noah.

36:36.652 --> 36:37.904
Yearbook!

36:42.658 --> 36:44.660
I'll just delete this immediately.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.996
Come on, let's just go, huh?

36:47.079 --> 36:48.080
I mean it.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.875
Now put your shirt on and get out.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.629
What he said made sense.
It also meant he cared.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.589
But what came out of my mouth was...

36:56.672 --> 36:59.592
I told you to stop telling me what to do.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.303
Oh!

37:07.141 --> 37:09.393
Watch this, Noah Flynn.

37:16.943 --> 37:17.943
Go, Elle!

37:21.572 --> 37:22.698

38:31.142 --> 38:33.311
but I'm... I'm desperate.

38:33.728 --> 38:37.106
So maybe if you could just
stop by the booth for a little.

38:37.648 --> 38:38.941
I don't know. I just...

38:39.400 --> 38:40.943

38:55.374 --> 38:56.709
It is what it is, Noah.

38:57.543 --> 39:01.630
I mean, I just really thought that maybe
it would be nice for you to do something

39:02.381 --> 39:03.924
for people that care about you.

39:13.976 --> 39:16.437

As you may have noticed, there's
a slight twist to this kissing booth.

39:35.956 --> 39:39.752
The people you will be kissing
are blindfolded!

39:40.211 --> 39:42.671

41:48.297 --> 41:49.798
The girls are asking for Flynn,

41:50.841 --> 41:52.885
and I have a solution.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.853
Alrighty!

42:02.937 --> 42:07.942
As promised, the next kisser is Flynn!

42:10.569 --> 42:12.530
Hold on. That is not Flynn.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.698
That is Lee Flynn.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.373
The only reason I ever talked to that dork

42:22.456 --> 42:25.834
was to make sure he'd get his brother
to come to the booth tonight.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.254
Let's go.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.514
I guess I'm next.

42:56.949 --> 42:57.949
Oh.

42:59.034 --> 43:00.536
I hope you like what you see.

43:09.044 --> 43:10.044
Hey, Elle.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.590
So, we're gonna hang out now.

43:13.465 --> 43:15.426
Oh, but there's another hour left.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.094
Okay.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.471
Yeah.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.890
Just don't do anything I wouldn't do.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.561
All right, see you later.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.650
Rule number 18: always be happy
for your bestie's successes.

43:32.067 --> 43:34.903
For me, that one has always
been easy to follow.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.071
No ways!

43:36.155 --> 43:38.616
I can't.

43:38.699 --> 43:40.159
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

43:42.661 --> 43:44.079
Ew!

43:44.204 --> 43:46.040
Imagine having to kiss that!

43:46.457 --> 43:47.875
I can't do it! Not with him!

43:48.375 --> 43:51.337
- Gross.
- It's payback time for lying about Flynn.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.505
- Who? Who's out there?
- It's Olivia's ex.

43:53.797 --> 43:56.133
And the problem is
we're all really good friends.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.635
Right, Olivia?

43:57.843 --> 43:58.719
Oh!

43:58.844 --> 44:01.138
- Yeah.Totally.
- Yeah.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.100
Say, Elle,

44:05.184 --> 44:07.394
you don't know Olivia's ex at all, do you?

44:08.228 --> 44:10.731
- No, well...
- Then it's solved!

44:10.814 --> 44:13.651
Oh, no, Mia, please!
I don't think this is a good idea.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.195
- Cutsies?
- What?

44:16.528 --> 44:17.363
Cutsies.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.686
- No, Mia!
- Time to get your dirty-girl on!

44:20.532 --> 44:21.408
Thanks, dude.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.826
Guys, I've never...

44:28.999 --> 44:30.501
Sorry.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.168
Oh, muscles!

44:34.588 --> 44:37.007
Sorry. Okay. Thank you.

44:37.633 --> 44:39.510
Oh, my God.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.679
Sorry. I know that you were

44:42.304 --> 44:46.308
probably expecting Olivia, so we don't
have to do anything if you don't want to.

44:47.226 --> 44:50.062
Truth be told,
I've never kissed anyone before.

44:50.145 --> 44:52.545
It's not that I haven't wanted to,
don't get me wrong.

44:52.606 --> 44:54.858
For example, I punched Ron Getler

44:54.942 --> 44:57.111
in the sixth grade
during Seven Minutes in Heaven.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.114
Sophomore year, Spring Fling,

45:00.197 --> 45:02.658
I was dancing with Randy Melrose.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.576
You know, a romantic song came on.

45:04.660 --> 45:07.287
I was like, "Oh, it's gonna happen!"
But... until...

45:07.371 --> 45:09.081
it just didn't, cause...

45:13.627 --> 45:15.337
This isn't so bad.

45:16.296 --> 45:17.631
Not so bad at all.

46:12.519 --> 46:14.897

didn't they?

46:15.397 --> 46:17.107
Yup. Pretty much.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.862
Oh, my God! Kill me now!

46:22.488 --> 46:25.157
Come on. Relax, Shelly.
It was just a kiss.

46:26.158 --> 46:29.578
Was it, Noah? Was it just a kiss?

46:29.912 --> 46:31.163
Yeah. Of course.

46:32.915 --> 46:33.915
All right.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.044
So I'll... I'll see you around.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.712
Noah! Noah! Noah!

46:38.879 --> 46:40.255
Keep up the good work, huh?

46:43.967 --> 46:45.302
"Good word?" What the...?

46:47.054 --> 46:48.055
Oh.

46:49.807 --> 46:50.849
"Good work."

46:51.975 --> 46:53.352
And then it hit me.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.563
Holy crap! What am I going to tell Lee?

47:03.612 --> 47:06.031
That was really close.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.115
Hey.

47:07.199 --> 47:10.369
Oh, hey. I'll be right back, okay?
Oh! That was really close!

47:12.246 --> 47:13.806
- Hey.
- Hey. Is everything okay?

47:13.997 --> 47:16.166
Yeah, the booth is crushing it!

47:16.250 --> 47:18.460
We have made more
than all the other booths combined.

47:18.544 --> 47:20.462
- No way!
- It turns out people

47:21.129 --> 47:22.339
really like to kiss!

47:22.422 --> 47:23.422
What?

47:25.717 --> 47:30.264
And get this:
I even wound up kissing your brother!

47:36.019 --> 47:37.019
What?

47:37.646 --> 47:41.525
Come on, Lee. It's no big deal. Seriously.

47:41.608 --> 47:42.608
What?

47:43.235 --> 47:45.112
It's for charity, right?

47:47.698 --> 47:48.698
Yeah...

47:50.158 --> 47:51.201
I guess so.

47:55.163 --> 47:58.125
Just don't end up grinding coochies
with my brother,

47:58.208 --> 48:00.419
or I'll literally never talk to you again.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.214
That and Rule Number Nine, of course.

48:04.298 --> 48:06.466
Of course! Right.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.427
Come on, Lee. Seriously. As if.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.038
As I ran home,

48:36.121 --> 48:38.707
I wondered if our kiss
meant anything to Noah.

48:39.082 --> 48:41.168
If I meant anything.

48:46.715 --> 48:47.715
How about a ride?

48:50.969 --> 48:52.095
Come on, Shelly.

48:52.179 --> 48:54.765
You know my mom will kill me
if I leave you out here.

49:00.270 --> 49:01.647
Holding on to Noah,

49:02.356 --> 49:05.776
I couldn't stop thinking
about the promise I had made to Lee.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.822
It's getting too dangerous.
I'm pulling over.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.625
But who knows if Noah
even wanted to kiss me again.

49:23.293 --> 49:24.836
That didn't really matter though.

49:27.714 --> 49:29.883
Because I still wanted to kiss him.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.933
You know, if we wait out this rain,
we should be fine.

49:56.827 --> 49:57.911
Wait, no.

50:00.288 --> 50:03.166
I cannot just be
another one of your conquests.

50:05.043 --> 50:06.503
Is that what you think of me?

50:09.381 --> 50:11.174
It's what everyone thinks of you.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.359
You want to know the truth?

50:33.405 --> 50:36.241
You are the only girl
who doesn't fall at my feet.

50:37.492 --> 50:39.661
And it is driving me crazy.

50:41.496 --> 50:45.125
It's one of the things I like about you.

50:45.208 --> 50:46.209
You're sweet.

50:47.085 --> 50:49.671
But you're not afraid
to call me out on things.

50:53.216 --> 50:56.762
And here I was thinking I was just
your brother's annoying best friend.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.514
Well, yeah. There's that too.

51:02.934 --> 51:04.978
Look, I don't know what all this means.

51:05.562 --> 51:07.731
I just like hanging out with you.

51:09.399 --> 51:10.484
It feels right.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.779
I'm just...

51:14.863 --> 51:16.656
I'm so confused right now.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.630
Did that clear anything up?

51:35.092 --> 51:37.094
No, I think we'd better try again.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.856
- Security.
- Oh, my God! We're gonna die!

51:51.274 --> 51:52.794
Is that you, Flynn?

51:53.568 --> 51:56.613
I thought I told you not to bring girls
around here anymore.

51:56.696 --> 51:57.696
What?

51:58.365 --> 52:00.325
You just took me to your hookup spot?

52:00.408 --> 52:02.786
No! You know what? Unbelievable!

52:06.248 --> 52:07.248
Thanks, Andrew.

52:09.459 --> 52:12.504
Still mad at you, but I am cold as shit!

52:12.587 --> 52:14.506
And you are taking me home.

52:16.216 --> 52:17.216
Now!

52:23.682 --> 52:24.766
Thanks for the ride.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.185
You know, I meant when I said, Elle.

52:27.352 --> 52:28.352
Good for you.

52:30.438 --> 52:31.565
So I'll see you tomorrow?

52:42.242 --> 52:43.368
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:45.078 --> 52:46.872
Why didn't Lee give you
a ride home tonight?

52:48.039 --> 52:48.874
Um...

52:48.999 --> 52:50.458
He just got busy.

52:51.042 --> 52:52.169
But that is the only reason

52:52.252 --> 52:54.880
you're on the back
of Noah Flynn's motorcycle, right?

52:57.257 --> 53:00.135
Of course. Duh. Come on.

53:03.180 --> 53:05.015
In spite of what happened tonight,

53:05.098 --> 53:08.310
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Noah said to me.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.104
And even though I know I shouldn't,

53:11.938 --> 53:13.857
how much I wanted to believe him.

53:22.657 --> 53:23.742
Rule Number Six.

53:24.201 --> 53:27.829
If you can't tell your best friend
about something you're doing,

53:27.913 --> 53:29.873
you probably shouldn't be doing it.

55:22.027 --> 55:23.194
Oh, um...

55:23.403 --> 55:24.403
Thanks.

55:24.696 --> 55:27.407
We never did get to finish
your skinny dip at Flynn's party.

55:28.158 --> 55:29.534
Oh, um...

55:29.993 --> 55:33.163
I was just way too drunk that night, so...

55:33.830 --> 55:35.415
- You know what you need?
- Hmm?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.459
Hot tub. Come on.

55:37.542 --> 55:38.877
Oh, no, that's okay, Warren.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.760
- Come on, Evans. It'll be nice.
- No, Warren.

55:40.837 --> 55:43.214
- Evans, come on! Don't make me beg.
- Warren?

55:43.298 --> 55:45.467
- I'm not feeling well, Warren.
- She said no, Warren!

55:45.550 --> 55:47.344
Okay. That's okay.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.803
Okay. I'm fine.

55:48.887 --> 55:51.848
It's all right. Can we... Can you just
take me home, please?

55:53.933 --> 55:57.020
Okay. Just walk away. Hey, just walk away.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.480
Let's go.

56:02.609 --> 56:05.028
Hey, come on, man. It's all good.

56:05.111 --> 56:07.489
I guess I'd also be pretty pissed
if I was slumming it

56:07.572 --> 56:09.783
with my little brother's sloppy seconds.

56:12.410 --> 56:14.287
Oh, shit!

56:27.801 --> 56:28.801
Elle, wait!

56:29.344 --> 56:30.344
Wait!

56:31.763 --> 56:32.763
Elle!

56:33.014 --> 56:34.391
Just get in the car, Elle.

56:36.935 --> 56:38.103
Just get in the car, Elle.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.772
Get in the car, Elle!

56:47.112 --> 56:48.112
Please.

56:58.289 --> 56:59.707
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

57:01.918 --> 57:05.088
What do you think? You think I meant
to fall for my brother's best friend?

57:16.266 --> 57:17.934
Wait, this isn't the way home.

57:19.561 --> 57:20.895
I want to show you something.

57:30.989 --> 57:34.617
How many girls have you made out with
in this spot?

57:35.994 --> 57:37.245
I only come here alone.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.249
Until now.

57:43.918 --> 57:46.629
Oh, you are good!

57:46.713 --> 57:49.507
That sounds so great when you say it.

57:50.049 --> 57:51.426
You must know that, right?

57:52.260 --> 57:53.386
Such a player.

57:55.597 --> 57:56.639
You haven't changed.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.185
I mean, what is the difference
between what just happened...

58:00.268 --> 58:01.936
The difference is you.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.147
You're crazy.

58:04.230 --> 58:05.940
I'm crazy about you, Elle.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.818
He is good.

58:13.865 --> 58:14.908
Okay.

58:16.284 --> 58:17.284
Okay.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.621
Here's how this is gonna work.

58:20.330 --> 58:23.666
Rules. Number one:

58:25.001 --> 58:26.127
No more fighting.

58:26.211 --> 58:27.253
Done.

58:28.713 --> 58:29.713
Number two:

58:31.674 --> 58:33.176
No more telling me what to do.

58:33.676 --> 58:34.844
Cross my heart.

58:36.679 --> 58:38.097
And number three:

58:38.806 --> 58:41.684
If we do this, nobody can know.

58:42.143 --> 58:43.686
Okay? At least until...

58:44.145 --> 58:46.940
I figure out a way to tell Lee.
It has to be that way.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.526
You know, you're cute when you're bossy.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.070
- I'm serious, Noah.
- So am I.

58:54.072 --> 58:55.823
You're really, really cute!

59:04.207 --> 59:05.458
Promise.

59:06.417 --> 59:07.417
Hey.

59:10.213 --> 59:11.213
I promise.

59:37.323 --> 59:38.323
Um...

59:40.076 --> 59:42.704
You know, we don't have to.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:38.551
You know when the time is right.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:41.054
And this was our time.

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:46.434
Noah and his stupid, sexy smirk
got the best of me.

01:00:47.268 --> 01:00:48.519
And I was happy about it.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:51.481
But now what am I going to do?

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.861
This is all your fault, kissing booth!

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.923
Nope. No. Nope. Never work.

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:00.550
What's wrong?

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.219
We're supposed to be
in a logistics meeting right now. Okay?

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:05.638
We're trying to figure out
how not to get caught.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.223
I don't see what the big deal is.

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:09.684
It's not like anyone's gonna think
that I have a girlfriend.

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.645
Oh, yeah, God forbid anyone
actually thinks you're in a relationship.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.981
Hey! I have my reputation to think of.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.940
Is that so?

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.235
- Oh, 'tis so!
- Really?

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.323
Shit! Hide!

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.160
- Just a minute.
- I need to get your laundry.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.829
Go, go down there.
Yeah! Just one second, Mom!

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.789
Hold on.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:32.874
Yup, come in

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.168
Ew!

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:37.795
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:41.841
You know, I could have brought
the laundry down.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:45.261
It's okay. I have an hour to kill before
your dad and I will meet the Andersons.

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:49.182
Oh, no.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.017
Shit!

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.029
Oh, and by the way, don't forget.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.323
We're going out on Saturday
to celebrate your big news.

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:08.075
- We don't have to, Mom.
- Of course, we do.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.412
It's not every day you get accepted
to an Ivy League school.

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:15.750
Oh! And I invited the Evanses.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:16.833
Do me a favor.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:18.961
Be sweet to Elle.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.838
She kind of has a crush on you.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.424
Really? I had no idea.

01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:26.135
Of course you didn't. Boys never do.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.224
Shut up!

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.227
Elle has a crush on you.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.562
She's not even supposed to be here.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:41.067
I have to be downstairs in ten minutes
and work on the prom banner with Lee.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:43.318
Um...

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:45.488
So, Ivy League school, huh?

01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:47.532
It's not a big deal.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:49.366
Which school?

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.451
Harvard.

01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:55.122
Are you shitting me?

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:56.415
That's amazing!

01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.795
I don't even know
if I'm gonna go or not yet.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.968
Listen, you can't tell anybody
about this, okay?

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:10.137
And that was the first time it hit me.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:13.683
Noah would be leaving for college. Soon.

01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:18.312
But we need to get you out of here,
and lucky for you,

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:20.648
I've got your escape route
all figured out.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:21.731
Okay.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.282
You've got to be kidding me.

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:31.742
Or we could just go tell Lee now.

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:49.677
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:51.721
Are you still wearing your clothes?

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.432
Um... yes.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.728
Oh. Okay. I'll be down in a second.

01:04:58.811 --> 01:04:59.811
Okay.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.775
Geronimo!

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.799
Oh, hey, I think you got a text
from someone.

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:12.658
- I'll see who it is.
- That's okay. I got it.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.410
Lee, I said I'll get it.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:16.203
Why, is it from a boy?

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:18.038
Yeah, right.

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.718

on your phone?

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.003

you can come with Rachel and I.

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:04.598
Lee, there is something
I wanted to tell you.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.100
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, you made it!

01:09:07.184 --> 01:09:09.270
- Sorry. Traffic was crazy.
- Hey!

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:10.353
Hey!

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:13.357
So, it's okay if Elle comes to prom
with us, right?

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.859
Absolutely! The more, the merrier!

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:16.943
See?

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.404
So, what was it you were saying?

01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.072
Oh, nothing.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:25.035
It was about prom. So...

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:28.706
- Okay. Off. My turn.
- Bully!

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.124
Stupid.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.001
I swear to God. Says it right here.

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:33.169
It's so her!

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.798
Hey, could you pass me the wrench, please?

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:41.176
The little black tool box
on top of the shelf.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.636
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.100
Elle!

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.610
When'd you become such a doctor?

01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.612
Since I started getting into fights.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.823
You kind of learn to take care of yourself
when that happens.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.285
Why do you get in all those fights anyway?

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:09.747
I think I...

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:13.918
I guess it's kind of just how I'm wired.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:16.837
I don't believe that.

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.716
My parents even sent me to see
a couple of counselors.

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:25.221
But you know, we're all fucked up
one way or another, right?

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.182
You could change.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:31.977
You think I can change?

01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:33.896
You're Noah Flynn.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:38.359
I don't think there's much you can't do.

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:41.737
Hey, Noah, have you seen Elle?

01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:46.866
Hey.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:48.744
What's going on in here?

01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:51.080
Jesus! What happened your face?

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.417
Oh, I had an accident
and Noah offered to help.

01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:00.381
- Did you do that to her?
- What did you just say?

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:02.633
I said did you do that to her?
Did you hit Elle?

01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:05.116
- You really think I'd hit her?
- I wouldn't put it past you.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:07.429
Hey, no. Lee, I'm fine.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.306
I just tripped in the garage.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:10.766
I was looking for you.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:17.849
You really expect me to believe
that she just tripped?

01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:20.276
- Get a clue, Lee! You weren't even here!
- I swear to God,

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.945
- if you laid a hand on her....
- All right, that's it!

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.197
Noah! Hey! Stop! Noah! Stop!

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:28.784
Look at me. Noah, look at me!

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.664
Come on.

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:41.797
Is there something going on
between you two?

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:44.382
What?

01:11:44.591 --> 01:11:46.844
No, nothing is going on.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:50.263
Okay.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:51.681
Fine.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.685
But I really need to get out of here.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:56.729
Do you want to go downstairs
and start the car?

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.314
I just need to grab my things.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:04.028
Look, I have to tell him tonight.

01:12:05.237 --> 01:12:06.280
Yeah.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.780
It's time.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:10.951
That way I can take you to prom.

01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:19.376
What the fuck?

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:21.837
Lee, I can explain.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.422
Unbelievable.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.090
Wait, no. Lee. Lee, wait.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.843
Wait, Noah. Stay here, please.

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:29.136
Let me handle this.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.183
Lee!

01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:35.267
Lee, wait!

01:12:35.934 --> 01:12:37.728
Lee, wait! Wait.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.108
So this is what you've been
keeping from me?

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.903
You were never meant to find out this way.

01:12:45.986 --> 01:12:48.155
Seems I was never meant to find out
at all, doesn't it?

01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:50.616
Hey, lay off her, Lee.
It's not like it's all Elle's fault.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.618
You! Don't even get me started
on you, okay?

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:55.371
Telling other guys to stay away from Elle
to protect her.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:58.534
And there you are, treating her like
some slut that you picked up at the club.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.418
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:05.005
So you're trying to tell me
that you two have not slept together.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.098
I knew it.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:19.019
So you really just have been fucking
my brother and lying to me.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.063
- No.
- Okay, Lee. That is enough.

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:24.274
No, it's not enough. She has no clue
what she's gotten herself into with you!

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:27.069
This is bullshit.
You're acting like a hurt, little bitch.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.866
- Noah, get off of him!
- Stop!

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.451
- Noah, get off of him!
- Calm down!

01:13:34.535 --> 01:13:38.038
That is enough! Calm down! I'm not
letting you go until you chill out!

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.748
- Get off of me!
- Chill out!

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:42.418
- Get off!
- Get off him! Get off!

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:43.544
Please!

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:44.627
Stop!

01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:57.890
Here.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.107
Please.

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:09.862
Please, Lee!

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.865
Stop, Lee! Please!

01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:14.741
Lee, please!

01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:18.036
Please, Lee, don't leave like this.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.247
So much for Rule Number Nine, huh?

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.458
I didn't mean for this to happen.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.505
You know, my whole life,

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:34.261
Noah has gotten everything
that he has ever wanted.

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:41.018
The only thing that I had
that he didn't....

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:43.436
was you.

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.776
And now he has that too.

01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:52.111
Lee.

01:14:53.363 --> 01:14:54.406
It's okay.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.868
You two deserve each other.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:06.375
Elle.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.213
Look, it's okay. He'll get over it.

01:15:11.548 --> 01:15:13.967
Why? Why did you come downstairs?

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.136
I told you to stay inside!

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.263
Like you wanted to make things worse!

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.975
What is wrong with you?

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:25.562
You can not pin all this on me.

01:15:29.733 --> 01:15:30.943
Just leave me alone.

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:34.238
No problem.

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.953
Some people say you'll fall in love.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.580
And that's the person
you'll spend forever with.

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:49.169
They'll be the one who, no matter what,
you can't live without.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.005
But at that moment

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.091
all I cared about was Lee.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.553
And I was pretty sure
I'd lost him forever.

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:08.604
Hey.

01:16:09.022 --> 01:16:10.023
Hey.

01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:15.195
There's someone here to see you.

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:16.779
Lee?

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:21.576
Hi, Elle.

01:16:24.621 --> 01:16:26.456
I was hoping maybe we could talk.

01:16:34.798 --> 01:16:36.758
There's really nothing to talk about.

01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:41.179
I'm just really sorry for lying to Lee
about Noah and...

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.891
Now I've ruined our friendship.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:50.105
Elle, I was friends with your mom
for over 20 years.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:53.483
She was my best, best friend.

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:56.570
But if you think
that we didn't fight sometimes,

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.447
you got another thing coming.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:00.115
Really?

01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:01.198
Sure.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:06.705
But you know, I can't really remember
what a single fight was really about.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.374
But what I do remember

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.628
is that we always forgave each other.

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:16.048
It doesn't really feel like that
right now.

01:17:16.506 --> 01:17:17.758
Don't give up on him.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:23.597
You're lucky if you can get even one
really good best friend in your life.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.310
You just have to figure out
how to make it right.

01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:37.861
I gotta admit, the next couple
of weeks were pretty lonely.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.032
Noah was totally MIA.

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:44.493
His attendance at school got so bad,

01:17:44.576 --> 01:17:46.495
he was in danger of not graduating.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:49.247
Worst of all,

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.334
Lee was completely ignoring me.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:57.214
At least Dad had forgiven me.
He even paid for my driving lessons.

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.342
Decided it was about time
I got my license.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.930
Then one day it hit me.

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:10.102
Holy crap! Rule Number Seven!

01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:14.064
No matter how mad you are
at your best friend,

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:17.067
you have to forgive them
if they give you ice cream.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.278
I'm sorry.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:48.557
Hey, Mr. Evans.

01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:58.316
Where have you been, Noah?

01:19:00.485 --> 01:19:01.820
I had to get away and think.

01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:03.362
I'm...

01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:05.115
I'm on my way home now.

01:19:05.198 --> 01:19:06.198
Good.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.702
Listen, Elle's not here.

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:12.247
I'm actually here to talk to you.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.166
Oh?

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:17.293
I just...

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.921
I wanted to apologize.

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:22.007
About everything.

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:24.301
I shouldn't have let it happen.

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:26.052
It was all my fault.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:27.928
Not Elle's.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.601
But I'm not sorry that it did happen.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:35.061
Or for the way that I feel
about your daughter.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:38.939
Oh, Noah.

01:19:41.026 --> 01:19:43.528
I can't say I support the two of you.
I can't.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.573
But it's got to be Elle's choice.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:51.077
I just think that Elle is gonna have
to figure out what's best for Elle.

01:19:53.413 --> 01:19:54.413
I understand.

Hey... so I have been thinking
about our birthday party after prom,

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:11.301
and I was leaning towards
like a costume party, maybe?

01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:12.510
- Hells yes!
- Yes.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.595
Come on, you know me.

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:15.764
Any excuse to cross-dress and I'm in!

01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:41.081
Holy...

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:48.921
I know, right?

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:54.511
Dad, are you...?

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:57.554
Come here!

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.023
You have fun tonight. Okay, Ellie-bear?

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.525
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:17.701
No way!

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:26.084
This is amazing!

01:23:30.046 --> 01:23:31.046
Look!

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:33.842
Oh, come on!

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.721
Hey, Yearbook Guy.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:39.097
- Yeah?
- These pictures...

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:41.265
really good, dude.

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:43.893
Kind of makes you a little less annoying.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.519
Thanks!

Hello, Los Angeles Country Day Prom!

01:24:40.992 --> 01:24:43.995
Now, I'd like to introduce
this year's theme:

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.371
Memories.

01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.500
Photographs which show
images of great moments

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:51.086
from a truly fantastic year.

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:53.505
The moments that stood out

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:56.591
and helped to define
who we are as a class.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.803
It's a final look back on who we were,

01:25:00.553 --> 01:25:05.141
at the very moment that we're looking
forward to who we want to become.

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:12.273
So, for everyone out there,

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:14.859
let's make this prom the very best!

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.991

I wasn't thinking about Noah,

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:54.667
or Lee, or anybody.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:57.337
I was a small part of something
that mattered.

01:26:58.087 --> 01:27:00.006
The kissing booth
meant something to people.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.592
It was gonna be remembered by everybody.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:05.637
And that made me happy.

01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:08.640

in front of everyone,

01:27:59.148 --> 01:28:00.149
I'm telling you

01:28:01.150 --> 01:28:02.402
that I love you.

01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:09.909
I'm sorry.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:11.994
I just...

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:16.332
I can't keep hurting people
that I care about because of you.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.335
Okay? Nobody wants us to be together.

01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:23.131
Well, that may be true.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:27.260
But what do you want?

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:30.804
I want...

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:42.400
I want to go.

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:43.483
Elle.

01:29:07.592 --> 01:29:09.927
Hey, Elle! Wait up!

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.680
Hey.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560
Hey.

01:30:05.358 --> 01:30:06.358
Listen.

01:30:07.443 --> 01:30:10.947
I just came to say I'm sorry about
what happened on the lawn the other day.

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:13.533
And for everything with Elle.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.828
I never should have been lying to you.

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.372
But I wanted you to know that...

01:30:20.039 --> 01:30:21.666
I was never playing Elle.

01:30:23.042 --> 01:30:25.545
And I meant everything
that I said to her tonight.

01:30:30.716 --> 01:30:32.343
And not that you care,

01:30:34.637 --> 01:30:36.472
but I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.

01:30:38.474 --> 01:30:41.978
I figured I'd try to get settled in
before the fall term. You know?

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:47.691
All right.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.486
Well, I'll see you around, eh?

01:30:53.489 --> 01:30:54.489
Oh, and...

01:30:58.619 --> 01:30:59.912
Happy birthday, man.

01:31:08.212 --> 01:31:09.964
Rachel's getting here in ten minutes.

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:12.467
Is Noah gonna be here tonight?

01:31:13.092 --> 01:31:16.053
He told me last night
he was leaving for Harvard today.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.349
He just didn't want to be around here.

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:23.102
But hey, it's for the best.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.480
I mean, I think you did the right thing.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:28.565
Don't you?

01:31:31.277 --> 01:31:32.277
Yeah.

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:44.290
So, what'd you wish for?

01:31:44.373 --> 01:31:46.083
No, you know the rules.

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:47.918
Rule Number One:

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:51.797
Only your best friend
gets to know your birthday wishes.

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:54.466
So, how about you?

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:56.260
No wish this year.

01:31:59.138 --> 01:32:00.181
Okay.

01:32:40.012 --> 01:32:41.681
Hey!

01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:43.683
Where you going?

01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:46.477
I can't keep doing this.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:47.562
Doing what?

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:55.945
Elle, what's wrong?

01:32:57.488 --> 01:32:58.488
Hey!

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:00.283
You're acting all weird.

01:33:05.204 --> 01:33:06.455
I love you.

01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:10.293
And I always, always

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:12.169
want to be close to you.

01:33:14.463 --> 01:33:16.465
But being my best friend

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:20.845
doesn't give you the right
to tell me who I can love.

01:33:21.345 --> 01:33:22.680
It's like with Rachel.

01:33:23.055 --> 01:33:26.601
What if I didn't like having her around?
What would you do then?

01:33:27.393 --> 01:33:29.520
- I guess I'd break up with her.
- No, you see?

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:33.399
You shouldn't have to do that just
because I didn't want you to be with her.

01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:34.567
No. Come on, Elle.

01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:36.890
This isn't the same thing as with Noah
and you know that.

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.613
Okay. Listen to me, Lee.

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:42.366
We made up our rules when we were six.

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:44.577
What are you saying?

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:49.915
I'm saying that I love Noah.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.751
And I want him.

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.670
And I'm sorry if that hurts you,

01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:57.798
and I'm so sorry
that I lied to you before.

01:33:58.633 --> 01:33:59.633
I was wrong.

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:04.263
But I'd be lying to you again
if I didn't tell you that I love him

01:34:04.347 --> 01:34:06.682
with every bit of my heart.

01:34:08.267 --> 01:34:10.394
And if you just can't accept that,

01:34:12.688 --> 01:34:13.688
then...

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:21.072
Then maybe you can't be part of my life.

01:34:30.247 --> 01:34:32.083
I think you're making a big mistake.

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.212
Then that's my decision to make.

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:41.633
You're right.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.930
I love you, Elle,
and I just want you to be happy.

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:47.640
Thank you!

01:34:52.269 --> 01:34:53.269
Okay.

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:56.023
I have to find him. Like now.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:57.858
It's okay. I'll help you find him, okay?

01:34:57.942 --> 01:35:00.653
Okay, let me go just make sure
my dad knows where I'm going, okay?

01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:02.905
Meet you outside in five,
and you can drive the Stang.

01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:05.241
- Thank you. I love you so much! Thank you!
- Go!

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:09.244
Here we go!

01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:12.415
Thank you for doing this, by the way.

01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:13.499
No problem.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.500
You know,

01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:19.714
I think the hardest part
was just seeing Noah's face at prom.

01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:21.757
Gosh, I wish I had just told him then.

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.843
But you know what? No matter

01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:27.847
how he feels now, I've just gotta find him
and tell him how I feel.

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:30.348
You just did.

01:35:33.519 --> 01:35:34.519
Oh, my God!

01:35:35.354 --> 01:35:38.232
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Jesus, woman! Pull over!

01:35:38.315 --> 01:35:40.151
Pull over! Pull the car over!

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.653
- My God! You're trying to kill us!
- Oh, my God!

01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:45.156
I was not expecting that!

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:47.658
Oh, my God! Like, what?

01:35:49.452 --> 01:35:50.494
Hi!

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.955
I thought you were leaving
for Harvard.

01:35:54.832 --> 01:35:56.751
Yeah, I was planning to, but...

01:35:58.627 --> 01:36:01.380
I decided I had to see you
one last time before I went.

01:36:02.673 --> 01:36:03.673
Noah.

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:08.262
And then Lee came upstairs
and he told me everything.

01:36:08.679 --> 01:36:10.723
And the old switcheroo was his idea?

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.768
- It was like a classic Lee, huh?
- Yeah!

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:16.479
He said something
about Rule Number 18 or whatever.

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.689
Rule Number 18:

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:22.485
Always be happy
for your bestie's successes.

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:25.488
Yeah. Classic Lee.

01:36:27.364 --> 01:36:29.408
Thanks for staying a little longer.

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.369
Well, I had to see you blow out
the candles on your cake.

01:36:33.078 --> 01:36:35.122
Happy birthday to me.

01:36:39.668 --> 01:36:41.045
So, what about Harvard?

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.309
I don't want to talk about that right now.

01:36:45.716 --> 01:36:50.346
You know, I want to know what it was
that you wanted to tell me.

01:36:52.848 --> 01:36:54.266
Um...

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:02.608
Sitting here in front of...

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:06.237
no one in particular,

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.118
I'm saying I love you.

01:37:16.455 --> 01:37:17.455
And I love you.

01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:36.392
The next few weeks
before Noah left for school

01:37:36.767 --> 01:37:38.936
we spent every spare minute together...

01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:42.106
up to the very last second.

01:37:48.445 --> 01:37:49.445
Goodbye.

01:37:49.905 --> 01:37:51.907
Come on, Shelly. Don't say it like that.

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:54.076
I'll see you soon,
and you can come and visit.

01:37:54.785 --> 01:37:57.037
- And we can make this work.
- Okay, stop.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.873
Don't say anything.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:02.126
I just want to be with you
for a few seconds more.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:04.712
You are cute when you're being bossy!

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:09.717
And don't turn back for a final wave.

01:38:10.509 --> 01:38:12.761
That is way too cheesy and romantic.

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:14.637
Even for me.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:31.821
Okay.

01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:46.002
See you.

01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:00.142
Maybe things really would work out
with Noah.

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:03.646
I hoped they would.

01:39:12.696 --> 01:39:14.239
But maybe they wouldn't.

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.413
And no matter how much I wanted it,

01:39:22.831 --> 01:39:25.584
things couldn't stay
the way they were forever.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:27.962
But whatever happened,

01:39:28.671 --> 01:39:30.339
I knew there was a part of me

01:39:30.422 --> 01:39:32.925
that was always
going to belong to Noah Flynn.

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:36.053
A little piece of my heart

01:39:36.595 --> 01:39:38.681
that would always be Noah's.

01:39:40.057 --> 01:39:41.350
And for the first time,

01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.271
everything suddenly seemed...

01:39:47.439 --> 01:39:48.439
possible.

01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:54.655
But it's funny when I think about it.

01:39:56.907 --> 01:39:58.659
Because all this happened

01:39:59.618 --> 01:40:01.996
just because of a kissing booth.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:24.601

01:40:28.313 --> 01:40:29.313
Mark.

01:40:34.778 --> 01:40:36.238
- No.
- How could that happen?
