01:18.023 --> 01:20.734
Excuse me. You know
where 42nd Street is?

01:20.819 --> 01:22.695
Hey! What are
you doing?

01:24.531 --> 01:26.907
Stop him,
he took my briefcase!

01:26.992 --> 01:29.201
I got you,
don't worry about it!

01:36.460 --> 01:38.461
Hold on a second, ma'am,
there, I'll get it.

01:38.546 --> 01:39.546
Thank you.

01:40.715 --> 01:41.798
Hey!

01:45.219 --> 01:47.637
Hey, you're holding people up here!

01:47.722 --> 01:48.680
How you doing today?

01:48.764 --> 01:50.140
Not so good.

01:53.186 --> 01:55.187

turnstile, please.

01:55.522 --> 02:00.151
Yo, we got it! Piano Man, Piano
Man. Billy Joel. Uptown Girl.

02:02.029 --> 02:06.198
Hello, beautiful. Anybody selling
tickets to Piano Man? Box seats.

02:08.118 --> 02:09.452
Piano Man!

02:10.413 --> 02:13.540

Les Misérables.

02:13.624 --> 02:15.834

Uptown Girl.

02:15.918 --> 02:17.502
Anybody selling ticket

02:17.587 --> 02:18.628
Uptown Girl!

02:18.713 --> 02:22.215
We Built This City on Rock and
Roll. You know that's it, come on.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.384
Hey, Janet,
how you doing?

02:24.677 --> 02:25.844
You okay today?

02:25.928 --> 02:28.973
You be careful today,
there's cops everywhere.

02:29.058 --> 02:31.726
Anybody selling
tickets for Piano Man?

02:34.521 --> 02:36.564

02:45.492 --> 02:48.035
I like that oriental
jacket you got on.

02:48.119 --> 02:49.203
That's $20 each, ma'am.

02:49.287 --> 02:50.537
Two for $20!
No, no, you got...

02:50.622 --> 02:51.663
That's $20 right
here, ma'am.

02:51.748 --> 02:52.956
You got to give me
another $20.

02:53.041 --> 02:55.751
Ma'am, you got two
of them right there.

02:57.629 --> 02:59.463
How you doing,

02:59.547 --> 03:01.131
How much is this
Harry Potter book?

03:01.216 --> 03:05.136

that Harry Potter stuff.

03:07.973 --> 03:09.557
You got kids,

03:09.642 --> 03:10.892
Yo, move your shit, man.

03:12.144 --> 03:13.520
Move your shit, man.
How much is your book?

03:13.604 --> 03:14.771
I'm just trying to
make some money, man.

03:14.855 --> 03:16.564
Harry Potter Versus
the Hipopotamus?

03:16.649 --> 03:17.732
This is misspelled.

03:17.817 --> 03:19.025
No, that's how
you spell it.

03:19.110 --> 03:20.236
Where do you
put the tape?

03:20.320 --> 03:22.446
No, it's not a Walkman,
it's an iPod, sir.

03:22.531 --> 03:24.698
Move all this shit, man.
Move all this shit.

03:24.783 --> 03:26.742
Excuse me, can I have
my money back?

03:28.120 --> 03:29.412
I want my money back.

03:29.496 --> 03:31.455
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

03:31.832 --> 03:34.375
Get off me!
Get off me!

03:34.459 --> 03:35.668
Come on, stop!

03:40.716 --> 03:42.509
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

03:42.844 --> 03:44.678
Drop this, man!

03:45.596 --> 03:46.596
Get off me, I said!

03:49.016 --> 03:50.642
Don't run, bitch!

03:54.021 --> 03:55.189
Watch yourself!

03:55.274 --> 03:56.566
Get off me, man!

03:57.443 --> 04:00.319
Look, I'm sorry. I'm
not trying anything.

04:00.404 --> 04:01.821
Grab that.
Grab that. Grab that.

04:01.905 --> 04:04.490
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

04:05.742 --> 04:08.619
Hey, what are you doing?
Just watch yourself.

04:08.704 --> 04:09.745
Give me
back my money!

04:09.830 --> 04:12.624
Somebody ought
to call the cops on you.

04:17.922 --> 04:19.714
Walk this way, walk.

04:26.764 --> 04:28.265
Pay your fare!

05:49.394 --> 05:50.894
Hey, Mr. Sou.

05:51.396 --> 05:52.771
How you doing, Mr. Sou?

05:52.855 --> 05:54.856
Good? You know that
Radio Music Hall up there?

05:56.986 --> 05:59.070
Man, I'll tell you, they
tried to kill me up there, man.

05:59.154 --> 06:01.781
I bought some stuff
from downtown.

06:01.865 --> 06:04.742
It was a fake book. I don't
even know how you do a fake book.

06:04.827 --> 06:08.162
I'm gonna get some umbrellas
from you, is that okay?

06:10.457 --> 06:13.209
Can I get some umbrellas from you? Yeah?

06:18.967 --> 06:21.260
You said $100
last time, right?

06:21.344 --> 06:25.431
I got in a fight, lost all my
money. This is all I got left.

06:26.433 --> 06:27.891
Is that okay?

06:28.685 --> 06:32.522
That's $100 right there. I
got one $20 left, all right?

06:33.899 --> 06:35.567
Man, I had my stuff at
Radio City Music Hall.

06:35.651 --> 06:36.985
I ain't gonna go down
there no more, though.

06:37.069 --> 06:41.156
They're a bunch of crooks down
there. I'll see you later, Mr. Sou.

07:08.102 --> 07:11.563
It's that kid from before,
Harvey. He's coming in here.

07:16.444 --> 07:18.070
Can I help you?

07:18.488 --> 07:21.365
Come on, look, I want
my money back, okay?

07:21.783 --> 07:23.701
What money are you
talking about?

07:23.786 --> 07:25.912
You know what I'm talking
about. Look, I don't mean no...

07:25.996 --> 07:27.205
Come on.
He took it.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.748
No, he did not... Okay,
I want it back right now.

07:28.832 --> 07:30.416
He took your money? Okay.
Same shirt and everything.

07:30.501 --> 07:32.085
This is Z and
as you can tell,

07:32.169 --> 07:33.670
he's a little retarded
sometimes, okay?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.380
Harvey.
Look, listen.

07:35.506 --> 07:37.465
How much are we talking about
here? Don't give him shit.

07:37.549 --> 07:40.093
No, no, listen. I've
got this. How much...

07:40.177 --> 07:43.722
Hey, that's not nice.
That's not nice.

07:44.182 --> 07:46.225
Here, thank you very much.

07:46.685 --> 07:48.602
I should call the police on
you, you know? You should.

07:48.687 --> 07:52.606
That's exactly what you should do.
I'll wait here for you if you want.

07:53.441 --> 07:55.192
You know, you shouldn't be
robbing people, you know that?

07:55.276 --> 07:56.527
And especially ones that
can come and find you.

07:56.611 --> 07:58.613
Why don't you sit down and
talk to me for a second?

07:58.698 --> 08:00.699
I just want to have
a conversation with you.

08:00.783 --> 08:02.117
I was talking
about you earlier.

08:02.201 --> 08:04.536
Look, try some of these bread
things, they're terrible.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.704
You're going to
go after this kid?

08:05.788 --> 08:08.873
Hey, wait up a second.
Where you going?

08:08.958 --> 08:11.668
You know, that was some show
you put on out there today.

08:11.752 --> 08:14.045
In the streets, you
know, the fisticuff thing.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.048
Can I ask you one
question, though?

08:16.133 --> 08:17.967
I'd much rather you
just stop following me.

08:18.051 --> 08:20.720
I'm not following you, I'm
walking down the street.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.054
But look, if you
want to make money...

08:22.139 --> 08:23.347
You know...

08:23.432 --> 08:24.557
Sorry, buddy.

08:26.351 --> 08:28.227
There ain't
no friends here.

08:28.311 --> 08:31.897
Think sitting behind a desk,
sucking ass all day, is making money.

08:31.982 --> 08:34.735
Look, I'm Harvey Boarden,
all right?

08:34.818 --> 08:37.696
Let me introduce myself,
I'm Harvey Boarden.

08:40.825 --> 08:42.325
Shawn MacArthur.

08:42.409 --> 08:45.203
Good to meet you.
You like to fight?

08:46.247 --> 08:47.789
If I have to.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.501
I can make you $5,000.

08:52.379 --> 08:54.422
Got you interested, huh?

08:54.506 --> 08:56.132
You see that store
right there?

08:57.468 --> 09:01.053
You ever wonder how little
places like that stay in business?

09:01.138 --> 09:05.349
BMW parked in front of it.
People dressed nicely.

09:06.810 --> 09:09.354
They like people
that like to fight.

09:09.856 --> 09:12.357
You want to make
some money at it?

09:12.692 --> 09:13.776
Huh?

09:13.860 --> 09:15.235
Yes or no?

09:15.320 --> 09:16.862
You don't want to make no
money, you don't have to go.

09:16.946 --> 09:18.363
You can go on
with your life.

09:18.448 --> 09:21.617
I can make $5,000 with
you on one fight alone.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.203
You can stay there
and go home if you like

09:24.287 --> 09:26.289
or you can come
and get $5,000.

09:26.373 --> 09:27.457
Wait, hey.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.459
You ain't got no place to
go, go where you're going.

09:29.543 --> 09:31.544
You better give me $5,000
if I walk across the street.

09:31.629 --> 09:35.089
Come on, break out
one of them umbrellas.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.382
It ain't raining.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.675
You're right.

09:39.553 --> 09:42.890
You know these guys, you
ever seen these guys before?

09:42.974 --> 09:46.310
I'm like an agent for them,
I get them talent and stuff.

09:46.394 --> 09:48.103
Hey, Christopher,
Jack.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.563
Hey, Harvey.

09:49.648 --> 09:52.024
Hey, Claudette, Martinez.

09:52.567 --> 09:53.818
Chinese guy
named Martinez.

09:53.902 --> 09:54.985
What?

09:55.070 --> 09:56.487
Go figure.

09:56.571 --> 09:57.613
That guy was Chinese?

09:57.697 --> 09:59.281
Yeah, his mother
or something.

09:59.367 --> 10:03.328
But those guys, they run every
bet place in this whole city.

10:03.412 --> 10:06.164
And that's what matters
'cause that's how you get paid.

10:06.249 --> 10:10.877
Hey, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson.

10:10.962 --> 10:13.338
Harvey, I have to thank you so
much for those Billy Joel tickets.

10:13.422 --> 10:16.258
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.
You look lovely tonight, ma'am.

10:16.342 --> 10:20.012
Did he do my favorite song,
the "Downtown Alexa" thing?

10:20.097 --> 10:22.098
Okay. Hey!

10:22.182 --> 10:23.641
What are you doing,
Harvey? No way.

10:23.725 --> 10:25.518
No way. I gotta go to 38th
Street to get some juice.

10:25.602 --> 10:26.978
It's about to rain.

10:27.062 --> 10:29.689
Get in the car, drive.
Get in the car, Z.

10:29.773 --> 10:33.192
I got an umbrella for you
anyway. Come on, get in.

10:33.277 --> 10:35.904
Get rid of the box, you
don't need that anymore.

10:35.989 --> 10:37.739
Where are we going?

10:38.741 --> 10:42.703
We're in a $100,000 Mercedes.
That's where we're going.

10:42.787 --> 10:45.789
Okay, so what
happened to the $5,000?

11:40.181 --> 11:41.640
Hey, here's your boy.

11:41.724 --> 11:42.766
Good morning.

11:42.850 --> 11:43.935
Thanks for showing.

11:44.019 --> 11:45.811
I got your text,
so here I am.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.063
You need a soda or anything?

11:47.522 --> 11:48.564
No, I'm cool.

11:48.649 --> 11:53.027
Do me a favor. Go get me
a orange soda or something.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.906
So what goes on here?

11:57.199 --> 12:00.785
Well, we're going to get you an
opportunity. You want to fight, right?

12:00.869 --> 12:02.537
I want to make money.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.874
Okay, first thing, we got
to make you presentable.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.835
Put this on. I don't
want to wear your jacket.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.172
Presentation is everything. Come on.

12:12.256 --> 12:15.300
It's about making money. I'm
going to give you an opportunity.

12:15.385 --> 12:17.177
Real nice smile.

12:17.261 --> 12:19.013
This thing
don't even fit me.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.139
Where's my change?

12:20.224 --> 12:21.516
It was $3.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.227
You know, I can get that
for $1 across the street.

12:24.311 --> 12:28.106
Yeah, and you could have gotten
it for 50 cents at the supermarket.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.900
Comedians.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.861
Come on.
I don't...

12:33.946 --> 12:35.154
We're going to
make some money?

12:35.239 --> 12:36.615
Yeah.

12:40.578 --> 12:42.079
I feel stupid.

12:47.168 --> 12:49.378
If they invite you over,
tell them you can fight,

12:49.462 --> 12:50.671
'cause you can,
you know?

12:50.755 --> 12:53.675
Better yet, don't even say nothing
to them, let me do the talking

12:53.759 --> 12:56.177
and I'll take care
of everything.

12:57.763 --> 12:59.347
Yo, Harvey,
you want a stove?

13:02.768 --> 13:06.521
Hey, Christopher, you guys are
still doing the fight stuff, right?

13:06.605 --> 13:10.191
I've got a guy right here.
Hey, Z, bring him over here!

13:10.527 --> 13:13.029
This kid right here is
an incredible fighter.

13:13.113 --> 13:14.113
Oh, yeah?

13:14.197 --> 13:15.448
Jack. Jack.

13:15.532 --> 13:18.909
Tell me, when was the last
time that you had a white guy

13:18.994 --> 13:21.537
that looked like this
in one of your fights?

13:21.621 --> 13:24.498
And you did college
and everything, right?

13:24.583 --> 13:25.541
You went to college?

13:25.625 --> 13:27.418
That is remarkable.

13:28.379 --> 13:29.713
He's the real thing.

13:29.797 --> 13:32.591
A white kid who went to
college, that's amazing.

13:32.675 --> 13:34.259
How come I never
heard of you?

13:34.343 --> 13:35.385
Well, he's from...

13:35.470 --> 13:38.513
No offense, but I've
never heard of you either.

13:40.933 --> 13:44.269
Look, I'm sorry, you know,
sometimes he's a wiseass.

13:44.729 --> 13:47.648
But he's...
I'm not joking here.

13:49.318 --> 13:51.152
I'll give him a peep.

13:53.655 --> 13:55.782
Yeah,
I'll give him a peep.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.743
White boy who
went to college.

14:03.124 --> 14:04.666
Thanks, Jack.

14:08.213 --> 14:10.631
Can I get my jacket back, please?

14:12.717 --> 14:14.885
Why'd you go
talking to him?

14:15.512 --> 14:17.429
He asked me a question.

14:17.514 --> 14:20.558
You got to let me do the talking
from now on, okay? Please.

14:20.643 --> 14:22.185
Okay.
Please.

14:22.269 --> 14:24.604
You know, I'll beep you
if he calls me. Come on.

14:24.688 --> 14:25.688
Beep me?

14:25.773 --> 14:27.107
Well, I'll page you,
text you, whatever.

14:27.191 --> 14:28.274
Where are y'all going?

14:28.359 --> 14:30.360
What, you lonely,
you need a friend?

14:30.444 --> 14:33.029
We got things to do.
We'll text you.

15:20.622 --> 15:24.667
Now there's these junk stores and
these vendors and these big signs and

15:24.751 --> 15:27.336
overhead construction
cranes and all this...

15:27.421 --> 15:30.340
Lady! What are you
yelling about?

15:30.425 --> 15:32.843
You know, they used to
sell drugs in that building.

15:32.927 --> 15:34.344
Well, that's okay,
but now they've got

15:34.429 --> 15:36.138
men riding elevators
to wash the windows...

15:36.222 --> 15:38.682
Well, let them...
Move on, it's okay.

15:38.766 --> 15:40.684
And you take your life in your
hands just crossing the street,

15:40.768 --> 15:44.438
there's so much demolition
stuff all around. Look at it...

15:46.942 --> 15:48.443
After you.

15:49.945 --> 15:52.322
Hey, Giovanni, you got
a refrigerator in there?

15:52.406 --> 15:54.782
Last one, baby,
get it while it's hot.

15:54.867 --> 15:57.785
Baby, come and get one,
buy one, get one free.

16:00.581 --> 16:01.998
Come on over.

16:02.082 --> 16:03.958
They had money on you
not making it.

16:04.043 --> 16:05.127
So this thing's
for real?

16:05.212 --> 16:06.295
Yes, it's very real.
Very real.

16:06.379 --> 16:07.379
$5,000?

16:07.464 --> 16:09.048
Yes, but minus costs.

16:09.132 --> 16:10.925
Hey, be careful with
those shoes there.

16:11.009 --> 16:12.051
Minus what?

16:12.135 --> 16:14.386
Costs. This is Alexander.

16:14.471 --> 16:18.307
Ray, Alexander.
Ray, Shawn.

16:19.392 --> 16:20.434
You roughed them up
the other day,

16:20.518 --> 16:22.687
so they're gonna ride
in the front and drive

16:22.772 --> 16:24.022
and you're going to be
in the back with me.

16:24.106 --> 16:25.732
No, no, I'm driving,
this is my car.

16:25.816 --> 16:27.859
And it's
a very nice car.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.613
You know, if your boy
wants to go, we can go.

16:31.697 --> 16:33.281
Wait a second.
Come on, man, look,

16:33.366 --> 16:37.452
I wasn't interested in no trouble
with you, so you need to relax, okay?

16:37.536 --> 16:40.039
Where's this
hostility coming from?

16:40.457 --> 16:43.000
Text me again, and I swear
to God I'm gonna hurt you.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.003
He keeps sending me these
stupid little things, you know.

16:47.422 --> 16:49.340
Just costing me money.
Come on, Harvey.

16:49.424 --> 16:50.967
Why am I sitting in the
car and it ain't moving?

16:52.219 --> 16:54.428
Come on, these little texts
that you keep sending me

16:54.513 --> 16:56.097
are costing me $1 a minute.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.893
So, what, I'm going to fight
this guy, then what happens?

16:59.978 --> 17:03.230
Well, we go in,
you win, you get $5,000.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.606
You lose, you get nothing.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.773
So we get
paid tonight?

17:05.858 --> 17:06.983
Yes,
we will get paid.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.777
You keep asking me
the same question.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.987
All right, Harvey.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.786
So what, they got rules or something?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.289
They don't like scared,
okay. There's the church.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.873
Yeah, if you kick him
in the nuts, you win.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.044
Right.
There's Sydney up there.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.671
Gouge the eyes,
everything.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.131
Come on. Come on, Z.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.465
This is Brooklyn, huh?

17:29.550 --> 17:31.468
Yeah,
as you can see.

17:31.553 --> 17:33.137
Hey, there, Sydney.
How you doing?

17:33.221 --> 17:35.973
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're late.

17:37.350 --> 17:40.978
We have to have this place cleaned
up by the morning, so hurry up.

17:41.062 --> 17:42.187
Okay.

17:44.899 --> 17:45.899
Excuse me.

17:45.984 --> 17:48.570
Here you go, do what you got to do.

17:49.196 --> 17:50.530
Excuse me.

17:51.198 --> 17:52.324
Scratch, bite.

17:52.408 --> 17:53.408
Thank you.

17:53.492 --> 17:57.245
Yo, smells like farts and
ass in here, you smell that?

17:57.330 --> 17:58.830
Smell like pure vodka.

17:58.914 --> 18:02.250
The place is a
playground, but, like, bad.

18:03.461 --> 18:05.462
Filled with bad people.

18:07.716 --> 18:08.924
Fighter.

18:17.768 --> 18:19.101
You ready?

18:20.270 --> 18:22.063
Go make some money.

18:43.879 --> 18:45.380
Hey, Jack.

18:45.464 --> 18:48.674
Harvey, you running on
Caucasian people time, huh?

18:49.593 --> 18:51.052
I'm running. I'm running.

18:51.136 --> 18:52.595
You're running?
Yeah.

18:52.679 --> 18:54.597
Yeah,
you keep running.

19:02.816 --> 19:04.566
Na zdorovie, brother.

19:11.658 --> 19:13.325
Let's see what
you got, Shawn!

19:13.410 --> 19:15.035
Let's see it, Shawn!

19:17.665 --> 19:20.834
Go, go, go, go!

20:17.853 --> 20:18.978
Ow!

20:41.753 --> 20:43.046
Yeah.

20:45.966 --> 20:48.092
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

20:48.177 --> 20:50.553
Hey, come here.
It's over, it's over.

20:50.638 --> 20:53.264
Come on, have a seat.
Don't smile at nobody.

20:53.349 --> 20:55.850
Just sit down.
Watch yourselves.

20:57.853 --> 21:00.231
You got some tissue in your
pocket? Anybody got tissue?

21:00.315 --> 21:02.149
Give him some tissue.

21:04.277 --> 21:05.861
He can fight, right?

21:05.946 --> 21:06.904
On the water fountain.

21:06.988 --> 21:08.489
Told you
he could fight.

21:08.573 --> 21:11.825
So you both should come to the
club. He's going to need a jacket.

21:11.952 --> 21:13.744
I got to get out of here.
Give him your jacket.

21:13.828 --> 21:15.746
I can't stand Brooklyn.

21:16.081 --> 21:18.625
You tell Jack I know
what I'm doing.

21:24.632 --> 21:25.882
Yeah.

21:30.471 --> 21:33.139
No, we're special guests of Mr. Dancing.

21:33.224 --> 21:35.309
Could you just
see for me?

21:35.394 --> 21:37.144
I'm telling you,
we're on the list.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.189
Will you let Renee know
I'm on the list, please?

21:40.649 --> 21:42.858
Let them through.
Two of you.

21:43.151 --> 21:45.695
Now, come on, Harvey.
Harvey!

21:54.831 --> 21:56.623
I feel like a bum.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.751
No, you look great.

22:07.135 --> 22:09.679
Cordell!
Cordell, Harvey Boarden.

22:10.931 --> 22:14.350
We're VIP.
We're VIP. Hi.

22:14.977 --> 22:16.519
We got VIP.

22:19.106 --> 22:22.984
That's reserved for us. Right
here. They ain't gonna tell us.

22:23.068 --> 22:26.238
Try to ink out. Come here, have a drink.

22:28.825 --> 22:32.077
You gonna introduce me to your friend?

22:32.704 --> 22:35.581
Shawn, this is
Shevonne Dubai.

22:35.665 --> 22:36.665
Am I pronouncing
that right?

22:36.750 --> 22:37.791
Mmm-hmm.

22:37.876 --> 22:38.959
Have a seat.
Have a seat.

22:39.044 --> 22:40.544
Yo, yo, yo!

22:40.879 --> 22:42.212
Come here,
where you going?

22:42.297 --> 22:46.801
Yo, man. I heard you were great
out there in Brooklyn today, man!

22:46.886 --> 22:48.637
He's a winner,
he's a real winner.

22:48.721 --> 22:50.305
Yeah, look, I meant
to say hi to you

22:50.389 --> 22:51.973
the other day on the
street, but with Harvey,

22:52.058 --> 22:55.143
you never know when anybody's
anybody, you know what I'm saying?

22:55.227 --> 22:56.561
Yeah, I think
I saw you out there.

22:56.646 --> 22:59.481
Yeah, yeah, you guys are just coming
from dinner, right, something like that?

22:59.565 --> 23:00.983
Right?
No.

23:01.068 --> 23:03.444
Yeah, listen, man, you ever want
to dine, I'll take you to a place

23:03.528 --> 23:06.364
where you don't have to sit at a
counter, you know what I'm saying?

23:06.448 --> 23:07.448
Shawn, right?

23:07.532 --> 23:08.741
Yeah, that's his name.
Listen.

23:08.825 --> 23:11.077
It seems we're going to be
working together, okay?

23:11.161 --> 23:13.537
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
I heard he'd already lined up

23:13.622 --> 23:14.955
to fight big boy
over there.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.375
Yeah, yeah, well, I was
talking to him about that.

23:17.459 --> 23:18.752
What is this, Harvey,
$10,000?

23:18.836 --> 23:20.754
Since when are you into
this kind of stakes?

23:20.838 --> 23:24.007
Can he just rest for a
minute? He just had a fight.

23:24.092 --> 23:25.175
You want some water?

23:25.259 --> 23:26.218
Yeah, yeah.

23:26.344 --> 23:28.303
Can I get you some
water? Poor Harvey, man.

23:28.388 --> 23:30.472
Let me ask you something.

23:30.556 --> 23:32.516
You think you could beat
big boy over there?

23:32.600 --> 23:34.476
Do we think
he can win?

23:34.560 --> 23:36.229
Harvey,
I wasn't asking you.

23:36.313 --> 23:39.315
I was asking your friend here in
the nice blazer, with the blonde.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.942
Can I do that?

23:42.695 --> 23:43.945
Can you all pardon
me for a second?

23:44.029 --> 23:46.698
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

23:48.075 --> 23:52.078
Hey, Harvey, you're gonna
lose that real quick. Watch.

23:54.874 --> 23:57.000
Excuse me,
Harry Potter book.

23:57.085 --> 23:58.210
You got to be kidding.

23:59.796 --> 24:00.838
Okay.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.172
I knew I was going
to see you again.

24:02.257 --> 24:04.717
Look, I feel bad
about that book.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.219
Look, you remember me?

24:07.303 --> 24:08.303
You remember me,
don't you?

24:08.388 --> 24:09.722
I remember you.
We spoke, you...

24:09.806 --> 24:11.474
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

24:12.476 --> 24:16.271
Hey, look, I just wanted to
take you to dinner or something.

24:16.939 --> 24:18.064
I'm good, thank you.

24:18.149 --> 24:19.274
No, I was thinking
maybe sometime

24:19.358 --> 24:21.192
something without
a counter. That's all.

24:21.277 --> 24:23.695
That's good. I like that,
without a counter.

24:23.779 --> 24:25.363
I just heard somebody
say that upstairs.

24:25.448 --> 24:27.157
You heard somebody
say that. Okay.

24:27.241 --> 24:28.617
No, look, I just feel
bad about the book,

24:28.660 --> 24:30.286
kind of want to, I don't
know, make it up to you. Hey.

24:30.370 --> 24:33.330
Hey. Thank you. Looking
beautiful as usual.

24:34.082 --> 24:35.875
I'm Shawn.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.752
Zulay.
Zulay.

24:37.836 --> 24:39.253
That's pretty.
Thank you.

24:39.337 --> 24:40.546
I believe in fate, so...

24:40.630 --> 24:41.714
I don't.
Oh, no.

24:41.798 --> 24:42.798
What do you think?

24:42.883 --> 24:44.508
If I see you again,
then we'll call it fate.

24:44.634 --> 24:46.803
Okay. One more time.
Okay.

24:47.722 --> 24:49.181
Goodbye.

24:49.265 --> 24:50.599
Counting on it. All right.

24:50.683 --> 24:51.808
Okay.

24:51.893 --> 24:53.268
Zulay.

24:55.730 --> 24:57.773
Bunch of losers
in here, man!

24:57.857 --> 25:01.067
Someone tell that idiot the
whole place is filled with losers.

25:01.152 --> 25:02.653
Right, Harvey?

25:05.199 --> 25:06.574
Hey, so we got
another fight, huh?

25:06.658 --> 25:09.744
Yeah, we are, but we're gonna
talk about it in a second.

25:09.828 --> 25:10.828
I'm going to meet you
over there.

25:10.913 --> 25:12.497
So what did you say,
$10,000, right?

25:12.581 --> 25:15.416
$10,000, that's like
a hundred $100s.

25:16.251 --> 25:17.752
There he is.

25:17.836 --> 25:18.961
Shawn, this is Jerry.
Jerry.

25:19.046 --> 25:20.756
Nice to meet you.
This is Jim.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.592
And that's Joel right there,
and these are their dates.

25:23.676 --> 25:24.927
Look, I'm going to
meet you over there

25:25.011 --> 25:26.136
and we're going to
talk about everything.

25:26.221 --> 25:27.304
Shawn.

25:27.388 --> 25:30.140
You know, we lost a lot of money
betting on your ass to get beat tonight.

25:30.225 --> 25:32.559
Well, maybe you'll bet
the right way next time.

25:34.395 --> 25:35.979
And what's the
right way to bet?

25:36.064 --> 25:38.817
'Cause, you know, I wipe
my ass with a hundred $100s.

25:38.901 --> 25:41.402
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, hey. Just have a seat.

25:41.487 --> 25:44.113
I'll be over
there in a second.

25:45.324 --> 25:46.866
Come on, Jerry.

25:56.253 --> 25:58.504
Excuse me,
we're sitting here.

26:00.048 --> 26:01.674
You're Evan Hailey,
right?

26:01.758 --> 26:04.176
Yeah, and you're
wearing contacts.

26:05.387 --> 26:08.430
Holy shit.
Shawn MacArthur.

26:08.723 --> 26:11.267
I'm sorry,
man, is this your girl?

26:11.351 --> 26:12.435
No. Uh-uh.

26:12.979 --> 26:15.522
So what brings you
to New York, man?

26:15.857 --> 26:17.357
Well, just...

26:17.441 --> 26:19.109
Martinez.
How you doing, man?

26:19.193 --> 26:21.695
Hi, bud, I know who you are. But
you have to excuse me for a second,

26:21.779 --> 26:24.614
I'm just... I'm bugging
out a little bit right now.

26:24.699 --> 26:25.949
You all two
know each other?

26:26.033 --> 26:27.951
I know who you are.

26:30.581 --> 26:32.582
Yeah. Yeah,
we know each other.

26:33.625 --> 26:37.336
I used to wrestle for Shawn's
father back in Birmingham, Alabama.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.797
So how is your father?
Yeah? I'm sure he's fine.

26:39.882 --> 26:41.007
Mmm-hmm.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.052
You know, I'm going to let you
all have a good night, okay?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.097
I'm gonna go ahead
and get out of here.

26:47.181 --> 26:49.308
Hey, come on, man.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.226
Relax, man,
come on, sit down.

26:51.311 --> 26:52.686
Hey. Don't touch me.

26:53.897 --> 26:55.480
"Don't touch. "
You know what...

26:55.565 --> 26:57.649
You worried about your jacket?
Huh? That's the problem?

26:57.734 --> 26:59.776
I'll buy you a new one,
how's that?

26:59.903 --> 27:01.820
I don't need your jacket. No?

27:01.905 --> 27:03.655
Hey, is everything
okay over here?

27:03.740 --> 27:04.782
Harvey.

27:04.867 --> 27:06.409
These two guys are
old friends, man.

27:06.493 --> 27:08.286
Evan just was offering
to buy him a new jacket.

27:08.370 --> 27:09.954
I said I didn't
need a jacket.

27:10.039 --> 27:12.081
Come on, Shawn, look.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.417
You guys.
I'm Harvey Boarden.

27:14.501 --> 27:17.045
Harvey Boarden,
go wash my car, man.

27:18.380 --> 27:19.589
You know, somebody
might hurt you

27:19.673 --> 27:21.132
for doing something
like that.

27:21.216 --> 27:23.469
That somebody
going to be you?

27:30.977 --> 27:32.686
Come on, let's go.

27:35.106 --> 27:36.982
You should go, Harvey.

27:38.777 --> 27:40.487
You're bad, man.

27:44.825 --> 27:47.702
Yeah, Harvey,
you can go now.

27:47.787 --> 27:51.665
Neolithic-looking idiot.
Always saying my damn name.

27:53.209 --> 27:56.754
My daddy used to tell me, "Nothing
good happens after 10:00 p. M."

27:56.838 --> 27:59.298
It's got to be damn
near 2:00 now.

27:59.383 --> 28:00.883
Right?
Yeah.

28:03.053 --> 28:05.054
You knew that guy, huh?

28:05.430 --> 28:07.932
Yeah, he used to wrestle
for my dad's team.

28:08.016 --> 28:09.058
Really?

28:09.893 --> 28:10.935
You know,
I'm gonna go, okay?

28:11.019 --> 28:12.728
Well, where you going?

28:12.813 --> 28:13.897
What, you need
a friend now?

28:13.982 --> 28:14.982
What?

28:15.066 --> 28:17.275
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

28:27.078 --> 28:28.328
Okay.

28:42.511 --> 28:44.137
Good night, Zulay.
Good night, Zulay.

28:44.221 --> 28:45.805
Good night.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.786
Zulay. Like July?

29:09.457 --> 29:11.416
Yeah, that's right.
I say that right?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.667
You did.

29:13.836 --> 29:15.920
I figured I'd take fate
into my own hands, you know.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.631
And you did.
I have to go. I...

29:19.300 --> 29:21.051
Nice seeing you, Shawn.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.554
Oh, you called me
Shawn. That's cool.

29:23.638 --> 29:25.598
Hey, you make sure
she gets home okay.

29:25.682 --> 29:26.682
Okay. Thank you.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.100
All right?

29:28.185 --> 29:29.185
Thank you, Shawn.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.187
Uh-oh! Don't use it again.

29:31.271 --> 29:34.148
My name. That's good.
Good night.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.979
Hey, King Arthur,
it's Merlin.

30:13.232 --> 30:14.565
Hey, man.

30:15.193 --> 30:16.527
What you doing here?

30:16.611 --> 30:18.862
That's what I was
gonna ask you.

30:20.949 --> 30:22.491
What time is it?

30:22.575 --> 30:24.868
You fell asleep
on the bench.

30:25.370 --> 30:26.787
You look like a crackhead.

30:28.039 --> 30:30.791
I just sat down
for a second. And...

30:31.459 --> 30:32.502
Wow.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.796
I can't believe you just
saw me sleeping on the...

30:34.880 --> 30:37.215
I just sat down,
just for a minute

30:37.299 --> 30:39.592
and I don't know, I just
kind of went to sleep.

30:39.677 --> 30:41.427
I can't believe it.

30:42.513 --> 30:45.431
I've got an extra room at
my place. You can stay there.

30:45.516 --> 30:46.683
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'm okay.

30:46.767 --> 30:48.226
If you like.
No, you're not okay.

30:48.310 --> 30:49.979
I was just about to
go to a hotel, man.

30:50.063 --> 30:52.565
Yeah, 7:00 in
the morning.

30:52.649 --> 30:55.442
They don't even check
you in until 1:00.

30:55.527 --> 30:56.986
You don't have to
stay at a hotel,

30:57.070 --> 30:58.946
I've got a place
right around the corner.

30:59.030 --> 31:01.532
But you can stay there
until you find another place.

31:01.616 --> 31:02.825
All right, look,
I'm gonna pay you.

31:02.909 --> 31:04.869
Yeah, you're going to
pay me back for sure.

31:04.953 --> 31:06.787
Come on,
grab your stuff.

31:06.872 --> 31:09.833
If somebody saw you sleeping out
here, you know what they'd think?

31:09.917 --> 31:12.252
We wouldn't make
no more money.

31:13.963 --> 31:15.338
Nothing's free
in this world.

31:15.423 --> 31:18.216
I just was there
for a minute or two.

31:18.301 --> 31:20.802
Well, you're in deep
with Harvey Boarden now.

31:20.887 --> 31:22.554
So we're going
to work it out.

31:22.638 --> 31:26.100
Make sure you wipe your feet
on that carpet right there.

31:26.476 --> 31:28.269
I'll shut the door.

31:31.064 --> 31:32.899
Okay, so here we are.

31:33.984 --> 31:37.445
Fresh paint job, new lamps.
It's all right for now.

31:37.529 --> 31:38.821
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

31:38.906 --> 31:42.159
You know, for now, at least.
But anyway, here's your area.

31:42.243 --> 31:45.370
That's a Sealy ostropedic.
I got that new.

31:45.455 --> 31:47.414
You like Broadway? You know? Yeah.

31:47.498 --> 31:50.209
'Cause I got tickets, you know,
like Legally Blonde and Wicked.

31:50.293 --> 31:53.045
Wicked's a very good one.
I don't go too often,

31:53.129 --> 31:55.797
but when I do,
I go and see that one.

31:56.257 --> 31:57.633
Is that you?

31:59.010 --> 32:01.221
Yeah, don't mind those,

32:01.305 --> 32:04.474
that's me, Jack and
Martinez, you know, and...

32:04.558 --> 32:06.476
Well, we were going to be
these moguls, you know?

32:06.560 --> 32:08.394
We used to sell tickets
at the Garden.

32:08.479 --> 32:10.063
It was when
we first got here.

32:10.147 --> 32:11.564
So you ain't
from here, either?

32:11.649 --> 32:14.901
Are you kidding me? I'm from
a place with some culture.

32:14.985 --> 32:16.779
Chicago, you know?

32:17.489 --> 32:20.532
But I guess you've got
your own story, too, right?

32:20.617 --> 32:22.952
You left your suitcase
out here.

32:25.622 --> 32:27.623
What, you got
gold in there?

32:27.707 --> 32:31.961
My father used to always say, "Stay
business, ready for business. "

32:33.755 --> 32:35.507
Well, you got to...

32:36.884 --> 32:38.760
So you got a plan
or something?

32:38.844 --> 32:41.805
You know, like a big plan
with this fight stuff?

32:41.889 --> 32:46.685
Yeah, I didn't travel all the way
to New York just to be some hustler.

32:46.769 --> 32:50.605
I figured I'd save up some cash,
play some professional ball.

32:51.566 --> 32:54.360
Open up a IHOP. You know,
with an office in it

32:54.444 --> 32:55.987
and my name on the door.

32:56.947 --> 32:59.282
What, like an International
House of Pancakes?

33:00.575 --> 33:03.661
Turns out all I ever was
was a two-bit hustler.

33:04.538 --> 33:08.791
Well. Guess that's not
so bad though, right?

33:09.127 --> 33:13.005
Well, by definition, that's just
somebody who can't win, that wins.

33:13.089 --> 33:14.631
We just won.

33:15.883 --> 33:17.801
I'm just saying.
You know, if that's...

33:19.178 --> 33:21.763
Get you some rest,
Shawn MacArthur.

33:22.473 --> 33:26.269
Go to sleep. We got
a big fight coming up.

33:55.675 --> 33:57.676
$10,000, right?

33:57.761 --> 33:58.844
Yup.

34:02.767 --> 34:05.101
Jerome. This
is Jerome, right?

34:11.108 --> 34:12.984
Looks like
we're here.

34:16.614 --> 34:19.367
Yeah. Look at this tough.

34:19.451 --> 34:21.827
I bet they won't complain about somebody

34:21.911 --> 34:24.038
putting up new buildings
around here.

34:25.206 --> 34:27.208
Come on, you guys,
get in.

34:27.292 --> 34:29.210
It took you
long enough, man.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.295
That guy's
waiting on you.

34:33.382 --> 34:35.382
Shawn, ready to
get your ass busted?

34:35.467 --> 34:37.886
This is where you take me,
Harvey? That's for suckers, man.

34:37.969 --> 34:40.554
Hello, ladies. This is
what I'm talking about.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.556
What's up, girls? Yeah.

34:43.059 --> 34:45.018
How you doing?
She's cute, yo.

34:45.103 --> 34:46.520
I like that.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.067
You're cute, why you got a mad face?

34:52.150 --> 34:55.279
Put a smile on your
face. Not my fault.

34:58.283 --> 35:01.494
I wonder why I don't come
to the Bronx that often.

35:49.463 --> 35:51.464
You know this
kid, right?

35:52.215 --> 35:54.258
Yeah, man,
he's a big dude.

35:55.218 --> 35:57.011
Don't get too close.

35:58.054 --> 35:59.972
Yeah, thanks for that.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.569
There you go,
there comes the king.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.114
Yeah. Get a good
look at that, all.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.922
Bring out the cash, papa.
Bring out the cash.

36:33.258 --> 36:34.425
Do it.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.847
Whoop his ass.

36:51.611 --> 36:53.570
Come on.
Come on, Shawn.

36:59.453 --> 37:02.372
Move, Shawn! Move, Shawn!
Stick and move!

37:11.215 --> 37:14.134
Work it! That's what
I'm talking about!

37:42.748 --> 37:44.207
Ah! My throat!

37:55.929 --> 37:57.471
Come on, Shawn.

38:13.364 --> 38:14.948
Shawn! Shawn!

38:16.075 --> 38:18.702
No, no! No, Shawn! Shawn!

38:35.387 --> 38:36.471
What are you doing?

38:36.555 --> 38:38.306
He knocked my shit over!

38:38.390 --> 38:39.725
My ear!

38:39.809 --> 38:41.602
Hey, what are you doing?

38:42.312 --> 38:46.065
We don't want no trouble!
We don't want no trouble!

38:46.149 --> 38:49.068
Hey, come on, move!
We don't want no trouble!

38:50.403 --> 38:52.404
I don't want no trouble!

38:52.489 --> 38:55.240
I swear to God,
I don't want no trouble!

38:56.076 --> 38:57.994
Come on, open the door!

38:59.330 --> 39:00.497
Push gas!

39:00.581 --> 39:02.082
Yo, my ear, man!

39:21.269 --> 39:22.853
He's okay, right?

39:22.938 --> 39:26.357
Yeah, his ear's a little
messed up, but he's all right.

39:26.441 --> 39:29.026
He didn't... Did he
say it was a dog?

39:29.861 --> 39:32.280
You know, he didn't fill out
no police report or nothing?

39:32.407 --> 39:34.199
A dog?
Yeah, a dog.

39:35.410 --> 39:37.119
Can you call him?

39:37.578 --> 39:40.330
Yeah. Nobody's
getting paid.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.959
I'm going inside.

39:44.836 --> 39:46.253
You should put some ice on that hand.

39:46.337 --> 39:47.379
Gotcha.

39:47.463 --> 39:49.298
It was a good
fight, man.

39:49.383 --> 39:50.633
Thanks, man.

39:50.718 --> 39:52.218
Hey.
All right.

39:54.513 --> 39:55.596
We really ain't
getting paid?

39:55.681 --> 39:56.723
We ain't getting
nothing

39:56.807 --> 39:59.600
'cause of them damn
maniacs in the Bronx.

40:01.103 --> 40:03.479
I really need money,
you know.

40:04.314 --> 40:05.523
Really.

40:06.568 --> 40:09.361
Look, I'm gonna work
something out, okay?

40:12.490 --> 40:13.615
Okay.

40:21.833 --> 40:23.293
I'm late every day
for work.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.003
It doesn't matter.
Go, do your job.

40:25.087 --> 40:26.921
I will, and the last
time, it wasn't done.

40:27.006 --> 40:28.381
Please, let me do the job. Okay.

40:28.466 --> 40:30.925
Lila, you're going to be good,
okay? Remember what I told you.

40:31.010 --> 40:33.011
Abuela, I know,
I'm just telling you.

40:33.095 --> 40:34.095
I'm telling you,
I'm reminding you

40:34.180 --> 40:36.264
because you forget a lot
of things, you know?

40:36.348 --> 40:37.766
Take it easy, young lady.
Let me go.

40:37.850 --> 40:39.434
Out? Okay, out.

40:39.518 --> 40:40.936
Let me go.
You relax.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.813
Are you sure you know
how to get home safely?

40:42.898 --> 40:44.106
You make me excited.
I know how to drive

40:44.191 --> 40:45.399
better than you,
you know that.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.651
Okay. Bye.
You know better.

40:48.445 --> 40:50.863
Oh, my goodness,
what kind of lady?

40:51.198 --> 40:52.740
Be good, Lila.

40:56.286 --> 40:57.703
Oh, my God.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.372
Huh?

41:00.291 --> 41:03.210
It's a funny thing, us
keeping meeting like this.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.795
Are you going
into work now?

41:04.879 --> 41:07.506
Yeah. What are
you doing here?

41:07.590 --> 41:10.592
I was just walking by, for the past
two hours, hoping you'd show up.

41:10.676 --> 41:11.968
Oh, stalking? Okay.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.136
No, I just wanted to see
if you wanted to come

41:13.221 --> 41:15.223
get something
to eat with me.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.391
I have to work.
I have 20 minutes.

41:17.476 --> 41:18.476
Just like...

41:18.560 --> 41:21.354
Twenty minutes? You're the
first one here anyway, come on.

41:21.438 --> 41:24.982
Remember, I've been here for
a while. So you want to go?

41:25.609 --> 41:27.443
Yeah? I have to be back, though,

41:27.569 --> 41:28.903
'cause I work here. I'll
get you back, come on.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.488
Twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes.

41:30.572 --> 41:31.906
Like, you don't have to
go if you don't want to go.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.326
Twenty minutes.
Okay, let's go.

41:35.203 --> 41:36.495
Twenty minutes.

41:36.579 --> 41:37.663
If my boss calls me,
I have to go.

41:37.747 --> 41:39.164
Okay, let's go.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.457
Thank you.

41:40.542 --> 41:43.418
Here, let me get that for you. Oh, okay.

41:45.088 --> 41:46.797
I'll get you some sparkling water, okay?

41:46.881 --> 41:48.507
Okay, thanks.
Is that good?

41:48.591 --> 41:50.760
Yeah, yeah.
No, that's good.

41:50.845 --> 41:51.970
So, is this
okay for you?

41:52.054 --> 41:54.347
No, this is good, this
is good. This is...

41:54.431 --> 41:55.515
It's good? Okay.

41:55.599 --> 41:57.600
I'm trying to figure out
what I'm gonna eat.

41:57.685 --> 41:59.936
I think I'm just gonna
have a calamari.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.062
Okay.
By: BackFire

42:01.438 --> 42:03.022
You know,
I ain't that hungry.

42:03.107 --> 42:04.315
All right.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.192
You're not hungry?

42:06.277 --> 42:09.864
No, not really. Thank
you, though. I'm good.

42:11.992 --> 42:15.578
So, that little girl in the
car, that was your daughter?

42:17.122 --> 42:18.414
Yeah.

42:18.498 --> 42:21.959
She seems sweet. I saw the
way she was looking at you.

42:23.503 --> 42:25.839
Yeah, she's sweet.

42:28.509 --> 42:31.219
What? I'm sorry.
There's a big pink thing

42:31.304 --> 42:32.429
coming down the road.

42:32.513 --> 42:33.638
Yes.

42:33.723 --> 42:35.223
That's pink bunny man.

42:35.308 --> 42:36.266
You think that's funny?

42:36.350 --> 42:37.642
Wow. That's a lot of
bunnies right there.

42:38.936 --> 42:40.228
You want one of them things? No.

42:40.313 --> 42:41.605
You know, I'm gonna go get
you one, hold on a sec.

42:41.689 --> 42:45.026
No. He's really
gonna go get one.

42:45.110 --> 42:46.319
Excuse me, sir.

42:46.403 --> 42:47.403
Can I get one
of these bunnies?

42:47.487 --> 42:48.571
Yeah, right on, my man.

42:48.655 --> 42:49.822
How much are they?
$5.

42:49.907 --> 42:51.741
$5? Here you go. Thank
you very much, sir.

42:51.825 --> 42:53.367
You have a good day, okay?
You too.

42:53.452 --> 42:54.827
Excuse me.

42:58.081 --> 42:59.499
Pink bunny.

43:01.169 --> 43:02.544
Thank you.

43:03.129 --> 43:04.421
You didn't want
that thing, did you?

43:04.505 --> 43:05.589
My daughter's
going to love this.

43:05.673 --> 43:08.759
She thinks the guy's from
outer space or something.

43:08.843 --> 43:09.927
So what's her name?

43:10.011 --> 43:11.053
Lila.

43:11.137 --> 43:14.264
Lila?
That's a good name.

43:16.017 --> 43:17.018
Oh!

43:17.102 --> 43:18.269
That must be my boss.

43:18.354 --> 43:20.396
I can't stay. I can't be
late for work again, so...

43:20.481 --> 43:22.106
Well, you just ordered.

43:22.232 --> 43:23.691
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm
just late. No, no, no, no.

43:23.776 --> 43:24.943
This is our date.
This is our date.

43:25.027 --> 43:27.278
Don't even worry about it,
I'll wait for the check.

43:27.404 --> 43:29.280
Date?
Yeah, it's a date.

43:29.365 --> 43:31.741
Date, okay.
All right, well...

43:31.825 --> 43:32.825
Yeah, get out of here.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.870
Don't be late.
See you later.

43:34.955 --> 43:37.206
Okay. You're in
a rush always.

43:37.540 --> 43:38.540
Sorry, I know.

43:45.382 --> 43:46.882
Here you go.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.094
Thank you.

44:12.703 --> 44:13.828
Harv.

44:15.455 --> 44:17.415
What the hell is
wrong with you?

44:17.499 --> 44:18.708
What is this?

44:18.792 --> 44:21.502
What happened to the
whole, I don't know,

44:21.586 --> 44:24.547
"be ready for business,
business ready" thing, huh?

44:24.631 --> 44:27.842
When I'm not being chased
out of the damn Bronx

44:27.926 --> 44:30.720
trying to hustle up you some
money, I'll be a little more alert.

44:30.804 --> 44:32.596
That ain't my fault.

44:34.599 --> 44:37.183
In fact, they actually want you
for another fight this Friday.

44:37.268 --> 44:39.060
Are you up for that?

44:40.771 --> 44:43.356
Yeah. How'd you do that?

44:44.191 --> 44:46.818
Well, I told you, I got
my connections, you know.

44:46.902 --> 44:48.611
It wasn't easy either.

44:50.239 --> 44:51.948
How much this time?

44:52.366 --> 44:54.492
Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about,

44:54.577 --> 44:56.536
but give me a second, I
need to put my clothes on.

45:00.166 --> 45:03.293
It's about this guy you're
about to go up against.

45:03.377 --> 45:06.796
You know, I know you're a
tough guy and everything, Shawn,

45:06.881 --> 45:08.465
but you're not
going to beat him.

45:08.507 --> 45:10.467
But he's gonna... Come
on, I can handle myself.

45:10.551 --> 45:12.885
I know you can, that's why,

45:12.969 --> 45:14.344
when he puts you
in the choke move,

45:14.429 --> 45:16.638
you're gonna go to
sleep, it's that easy.

45:16.723 --> 45:18.474
What are you saying?

45:19.601 --> 45:21.935
I think you know
what I'm saying.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.145
No, I don't know what
you're saying.

45:23.229 --> 45:25.355
Sounds like you're saying
you want me to throw it.

45:25.440 --> 45:29.151
Well, whatever you want
to call it, you know?

45:29.235 --> 45:32.696
We're gonna make some money,
not like up in the Bronx.

45:33.406 --> 45:36.241
You're complaining about
that whole thing, right?

45:36.326 --> 45:38.160
No, I'm not losing.

45:38.661 --> 45:39.828
I know you're
not gonna lose,

45:39.913 --> 45:42.081
you're gonna do what
I'm telling you to do.

45:42.165 --> 45:44.208
I appreciate everything
you did for me.

45:44.292 --> 45:48.503
But, you know, the only way I'm
going to lose is if somebody beats me.

45:48.587 --> 45:51.214
Okay, then, whatever,
let him beat you.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.510
I'm serious.

45:56.053 --> 45:57.595
Martinez came up
to me, he said,

45:57.679 --> 46:00.848
"You know, hey, if you go around
with me, that's fine, man. "

46:00.933 --> 46:01.974
I don't know.

46:02.059 --> 46:03.184
What?

46:03.852 --> 46:06.437
You and Martinez what?

46:06.522 --> 46:07.605
What do you mean, "what"?

46:07.689 --> 46:10.608
I want to hear why, you
know, you said, "Martinez... "

46:10.692 --> 46:12.527
I didn't say I was
gonna do anything.

46:12.611 --> 46:15.029
No, I want to know what
you're gonna do, 'cause...

46:15.114 --> 46:18.658
I mean, here I'm trying to talk
to you about making you some money,

46:18.742 --> 46:21.494
and, you know, nobody made
anything up in the Bronx, right?

46:21.578 --> 46:22.578
You know that.

46:22.663 --> 46:23.829
I know that. I understand. I know.

46:23.913 --> 46:25.455
And you're gonna threaten me now, right?

46:25.540 --> 46:26.623
What? I'm not
threatening you.

46:26.707 --> 46:29.918
You're not threatening me? I
take you off of a park bench,

46:30.002 --> 46:31.920
and you're going to
threaten me in my house?

46:32.004 --> 46:33.213
Harvey, I ain't
threatening you.

46:33.297 --> 46:34.714
No, I know you're
not threatening me,

46:34.799 --> 46:35.799
'cause you know why?

46:35.883 --> 46:37.801
'Cause you're gonna get
out of my house now, Shawn.

46:37.885 --> 46:39.344
Look, hold on.
I'm sorry, okay?

46:39.428 --> 46:40.470
No.

46:40.555 --> 46:42.389
No, no.
Get out of my house.

46:42.473 --> 46:44.933
Grab your garbage
and go. Okay?

46:49.897 --> 46:51.022
Okay.

47:18.925 --> 47:20.926
Hey, there,
Ms. Florence.

47:24.681 --> 47:26.640
Dog's got a demon in it.

47:29.853 --> 47:31.103
Demons.

47:33.023 --> 47:34.690
You know, I gave you
a place to stay, Shawn,

47:34.774 --> 47:35.982
'cause that's
what you needed.

47:36.066 --> 47:39.861
It was a place to stay, it didn't
have any of this other stuff.

47:39.945 --> 47:41.613
I understand that.

47:43.866 --> 47:47.827
You saw that picture I showed
you of Martinez and Jack and me?

47:48.621 --> 47:50.955
I didn't say I was
gonna go with him.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.458
I had a whole
lot then, Shawn.

47:55.044 --> 47:59.255
He broke my leg for $100.
That's crazy, right?

48:00.007 --> 48:01.007
$100.

48:01.091 --> 48:02.967
All I was saying is,
I wanted to win.

48:03.761 --> 48:05.511
That's it,
that's all I wanted.

48:05.596 --> 48:08.431
It's funny, you lose
one step in this game

48:09.892 --> 48:11.892
and everybody leaves you.

48:14.187 --> 48:17.147
At one point, there was
a whole lot of people

48:18.107 --> 48:20.984
that would put a whole
lot of money on me.

48:30.662 --> 48:33.622
You really think you
can beat this kid, huh?

48:34.999 --> 48:37.209
I hear he's fierce,
you know?

48:41.631 --> 48:44.174
'Cause if you lose,
you get nothing.

48:47.219 --> 48:49.011
You win, you get...

48:49.846 --> 48:51.430
You get $30,000.

48:52.516 --> 48:53.599
Hmm.

49:04.736 --> 49:05.903
Okay.

49:08.865 --> 49:10.533
Okay, we'll do it.

49:42.189 --> 49:43.231
Hi.

49:48.362 --> 49:49.738
Hey, sweetie.

49:49.822 --> 49:51.489
Hi.
Hi.

49:51.574 --> 49:53.116
How are you?

49:53.367 --> 49:54.868
So what are you
doing here?

49:54.952 --> 49:57.287
Waiting for you
the whole time.

49:57.371 --> 49:59.038
That's a man, bro.

50:00.165 --> 50:01.623
You're a man?

50:02.834 --> 50:04.084
Hell, no.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.183
Sit.

50:19.267 --> 50:20.351
Thank you.

50:21.853 --> 50:23.604
I'll be right back.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.426
Z, fold this up.

51:19.283 --> 51:23.328
Harvey, you know you got no
business in a place like this, right?

52:06.746 --> 52:08.289
Come on, Shawn.

52:39.028 --> 52:40.195
Shit!

53:00.548 --> 53:01.924
Holy shit!

53:19.943 --> 53:21.318
Yeah! Yeah!

53:37.793 --> 53:39.460
Get out of there!

53:42.589 --> 53:43.798
Get out!

53:50.389 --> 53:52.348
Pick his ass up!
Come on! Get up!

53:57.896 --> 53:59.146
Yeah! Yeah!

54:00.315 --> 54:01.691
There it is!

54:06.572 --> 54:07.697
Yeah!

54:25.298 --> 54:27.048
Yo, Shawn, get up.

54:28.926 --> 54:30.176
We won!

54:31.178 --> 54:36.516
Yeah, baby! We won!
Get up, get up, yeah!

54:36.642 --> 54:39.352
No more deliveries tonight, man. You!

54:40.021 --> 54:41.813
Your man
got knocked out!

54:43.149 --> 54:45.108
What, baby! That's us!

54:45.192 --> 54:49.028
What! You saw that!
You saw that! That's us!

54:51.531 --> 54:52.906
Yeah, baby!

54:55.410 --> 54:58.621
Well, looks like
Harvey's got a winner.

54:59.122 --> 55:01.332
That's us, baby,
all the way!

55:05.003 --> 55:05.961
Get out of the car...

55:06.046 --> 55:07.671
No, no.
I'm proud of you.

55:07.756 --> 55:10.049
You put the works on
Bruce Lee, though, man!

55:10.133 --> 55:11.300
I got to give
it to you.

55:11.384 --> 55:12.760
Get out of my car.

55:12.844 --> 55:14.094
Come on, Harv. Let me out.

55:16.056 --> 55:17.306
Come on,
Harvey, let's go.

55:17.390 --> 55:18.932
Let's get a drink,
Harvey.

55:19.017 --> 55:20.017
Aren't you going
to have one?

55:20.101 --> 55:22.352
No, I don't want to. Go, it's
your night, have a good night.

55:22.436 --> 55:23.811
Man, it's raining,
come on.

55:23.896 --> 55:26.314
I'm going to go home and
count my money. Leave me alone.

55:26.398 --> 55:28.149
All right, grandpa.

55:30.819 --> 55:33.946
Don't get in no trouble.
I'm serious, though.

55:34.031 --> 55:36.991
Come on, serious.
Come in, just have one.

55:37.076 --> 55:38.534
I ain't got nothing, go.

55:38.619 --> 55:40.411
Thanks for tonight.

55:44.541 --> 55:46.084
Thanks, Renee,
I appreciate it.

55:46.168 --> 55:47.251
Yes, sir.

55:53.634 --> 55:57.053
Please tell me you're not still
putting money in your sock.

55:57.137 --> 55:59.763
What'd your father
used to call that?

56:01.099 --> 56:03.725
Niggerish, that's what
it was, right?

56:07.939 --> 56:10.482
So this is who you hanging
out with these days, Shawn?

56:10.566 --> 56:12.109
These your boys?

56:12.193 --> 56:15.654
Saw you step out your fancy
stretch limousine there.

56:16.322 --> 56:19.533
What, did you all pass
around a hat to get that?

56:19.617 --> 56:21.410
Take up a collection?

56:23.287 --> 56:25.205
You know, the only enjoyment
I got back in college, Shawn,

56:25.289 --> 56:26.665
was watching
your asshole father

56:26.749 --> 56:29.042
humiliate your shit
all over the place.

56:29.127 --> 56:30.335
Really?

56:30.795 --> 56:33.796
Until your bitch-ass cold-clocked
him in front of the whole gym.

56:40.637 --> 56:41.887
Come on!

56:42.639 --> 56:44.140
I'm right here!

56:44.975 --> 56:46.225
Do something!
I'm right here!

56:46.309 --> 56:47.560
Shawn! Look at me!

56:47.644 --> 56:48.853
Like your bitch-ass daddy.

56:48.937 --> 56:51.313
Shawn, Shawn,
what are you doing?

56:52.983 --> 56:53.983
I ain't your father.

56:54.067 --> 56:55.651
You can't go to
a club and have fun.

56:55.694 --> 56:58.738
That's right. I'm cool.
I'll see you around.

57:01.408 --> 57:03.284
Let's get out of here.

57:08.498 --> 57:11.958
It's ridiculous. I don't
even... I can't stand him.

57:16.672 --> 57:18.715
I just... It's not late.

57:21.135 --> 57:24.596
This guy's always putting
these notes on people's doors.

57:25.598 --> 57:28.349
It's not late,
though. Sorry.

57:28.851 --> 57:29.851
It's okay.

57:29.935 --> 57:31.686
I hit you with
the door. So...

57:31.937 --> 57:33.855
This is my living room.

57:34.273 --> 57:37.317
I have to go and check
on Lila, so have a seat.

57:38.861 --> 57:39.861
It's nice, right?

57:39.945 --> 57:41.029
It's really nice.

57:41.113 --> 57:42.447
Thank you.

57:42.740 --> 57:43.948
Big TV.

57:44.033 --> 57:45.824
It is, right?
Yeah.

57:47.076 --> 57:48.535
Okay.
Okay.

57:54.083 --> 57:56.251
Hi, I'm Shawn.

57:58.630 --> 58:00.380
I'm Zulay's friend.

58:01.549 --> 58:04.009
She brought
me over to...

58:05.220 --> 58:08.055
Zulay. Zulay.

58:08.807 --> 58:09.807
What happened?

58:09.891 --> 58:11.433
This is...
I'm sorry, this is...

58:11.518 --> 58:12.726
This is Shawn.
Shawn, this is...

58:12.811 --> 58:14.102
I don't care
who is he.

58:14.187 --> 58:17.773
I care why you bring anybody
at this time to the house.

58:17.857 --> 58:18.899
He look like
a criminal.

58:18.983 --> 58:19.983
I know...

58:20.068 --> 58:22.068
You're not supposed to bring
nobody at this time to the house.

58:22.194 --> 58:24.111
I'm sorry... Don't be sorry.
Don't do that to me no more.

58:24.196 --> 58:25.238
Okay?

58:26.406 --> 58:27.907
Please,
don't say "por favor. "

58:27.991 --> 58:29.534
I don't want to hear nobody
in the house at this time.

58:31.912 --> 58:34.497
Hi. What are you
doing up this late?

58:36.083 --> 58:37.250
What's that?

58:37.334 --> 58:38.501
My pink bunny.

58:38.585 --> 58:40.127
Sorry. What are
you doing up?

58:40.212 --> 58:41.879
My grandma thinks
you killed someone.

58:41.964 --> 58:45.299
He didn't kill somebody.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

58:45.384 --> 58:46.467
Why are you up, baby?

58:46.552 --> 58:48.719
I want to see
the scary man.

58:51.348 --> 58:52.890
I hear that I'm gonna
cook for you.

58:52.975 --> 58:56.394
I'm gonna do it, but as soon as
you eat, please, you got to go.

58:56.478 --> 58:57.853
Okay?
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

58:57.937 --> 58:58.895
Look at the way you are.
Look at you.

58:58.980 --> 59:00.021
Please, it's okay.

59:00.106 --> 59:02.023
I'm sorry, actually, you
know what? Look at you. Look!

59:02.108 --> 59:03.817
You know what?
I need some thread.

59:03.901 --> 59:05.026
What a shirt.

59:05.111 --> 59:06.278
I'm going to
fix it for him.

59:06.362 --> 59:08.280
I'm gonna take a needle and do some job.

59:08.364 --> 59:10.240
That way he don't
gotta stay like that.

59:10.324 --> 59:11.700
You don't feel bad?
I do.

59:11.784 --> 59:13.702
What kind of men look
like that on the street?

59:13.786 --> 59:15.871
Thank you so
much for the...

59:15.955 --> 59:19.708
Come on, no. Back.
Back, let's go back.

59:19.792 --> 59:21.293
I don't want
to go to bed.

59:21.377 --> 59:22.627
Let's go back,
back to sleep.

59:27.800 --> 59:28.967
Mmm-hmm.

59:30.219 --> 59:31.469
Uh-huh?

59:34.055 --> 59:36.056
Shawn has something
he wants to tell you.

59:36.141 --> 59:37.308
What?

59:43.607 --> 59:46.567
I don't understand what you
talk. Talk English, Spanish?

59:50.322 --> 59:51.488
Okay.

59:53.158 --> 59:54.825
She's wide awake.

59:55.327 --> 59:57.077
This is going good.

59:58.330 --> 01:00:02.333
I don't know, so... Hey, that
notice that was on your door,

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:04.251
everything all right?

01:00:06.046 --> 01:00:07.630
Like, if you...

01:00:07.714 --> 01:00:09.255
You know,
if you need anything.

01:00:14.595 --> 01:00:15.970
Just let me know.

01:00:16.055 --> 01:00:17.180
So...

01:00:20.142 --> 01:00:24.520
That guy, Evan, from
the club, you know him?

01:00:25.648 --> 01:00:28.107
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, I know him.

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:29.692
How do you know him?

01:00:29.777 --> 01:00:32.111
Well, I don't, I just...

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:34.113
People were talking about
him at the club all night.

01:00:34.198 --> 01:00:36.532
I guess he's a pro or something?
What, does he fight? A boxer?

01:00:36.617 --> 01:00:38.117
Yeah, I mean,
a couple, you know,

01:00:38.202 --> 01:00:39.243
the guys at the club
or whatever,

01:00:39.328 --> 01:00:41.162
we just came back
from this...

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:43.998
You know, it's not a
professional thing, but...

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.666
Out in, like, you know,
Korea land,

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.210
we just came
from a fight, too.

01:00:49.462 --> 01:00:51.004
You know,
it went pretty well.

01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:52.881
So you're a fighter?

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.299
No, I mean, yeah.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.510
But not professional. Just,
you know... I don't know...

01:00:56.594 --> 01:00:59.304
I got this guy, he's an
agent/coach sort of thing.

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:02.391
I mean, it's been going
pretty good, though.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:08.021
What?
I don't know.

01:01:23.745 --> 01:01:26.122
So how do you know all
those guys at the club?

01:01:26.206 --> 01:01:27.748
I don't. I...

01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.126
I don't even know
your name, really.

01:01:30.210 --> 01:01:32.628
What's your name?
Your last name?

01:01:34.089 --> 01:01:35.423
MacArthur.

01:01:35.799 --> 01:01:40.261
Shawn MacArthur. Like
a knight. I like it.

01:01:46.643 --> 01:01:48.811
What are you
thinking about?

01:01:53.817 --> 01:01:54.942
So...

01:01:55.027 --> 01:01:56.110
Simple as that.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.656
I can fix this for you.

01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:04.075
Hmm?

01:02:04.994 --> 01:02:06.036
I want to fix
this for you.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.871
It's not so bad.
You want to fix it?

01:02:07.955 --> 01:02:09.080
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:12.917
I want to kiss you.

01:02:18.758 --> 01:02:20.091
Come on...

01:02:23.888 --> 01:02:25.305
Why are you shaking?

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:28.516
Because I lied about
being able to sew.

01:02:31.437 --> 01:02:34.063
It looks like
you're doing a good job.

01:02:36.483 --> 01:02:38.150
Look at that mess.

01:02:41.237 --> 01:02:42.404
Wow, I am shaking.

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:47.326
Wait, come here for a second.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.746
Give me your finger.

01:02:52.999 --> 01:02:53.999
Make a wish.

01:02:58.505 --> 01:02:59.880
I got mine,
you got yours?

01:02:59.964 --> 01:03:01.048
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:02.717 --> 01:03:03.842
I do.

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:09.263
Excuse me! You got to go.
I'm sorry. I know.

01:03:09.348 --> 01:03:10.598
Enough is enough.
Please go.

01:03:10.682 --> 01:03:11.641
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:11.725 --> 01:03:13.392
I believe it's enough
for today.

01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:14.936
You can meet
later today.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:16.062
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

01:03:16.146 --> 01:03:17.105
Just a second to say bye.

01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:20.024
No second. Come in.
You come in.

01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:22.235
Thank you so much, Mrs.
Valez, I appreciate it.

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:24.821
I'm no Mrs. Valez,
I'm Mrs. Guzman. Okay?

01:03:24.905 --> 01:03:26.072
And you got to go. Go.

01:03:26.156 --> 01:03:27.615
Give me one second
to say bye, please.

01:03:27.699 --> 01:03:30.201
Oh, my goodness, you give
me so much trouble today.

01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:32.703
I'm sorry.

01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:36.290
She could have come a little
bit later, that's for sure.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:37.375
That would have
been nice.

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:38.459
Totally. I know.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.045
Okay, so...

01:03:43.382 --> 01:03:44.464
Okay.

01:03:44.966 --> 01:03:45.966
Good night, yeah...

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.676
So I'm going to
see you again?

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.053
Yeah.
Yeah. When?

01:03:59.772 --> 01:04:01.189
You sleeping?

01:04:01.274 --> 01:04:04.317
Who can sleep with all
that banging up there?

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.696
Told you we'd win, huh?

01:04:08.906 --> 01:04:10.824
Did you get our money?

01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:13.994
Right at it, huh?

01:04:14.078 --> 01:04:15.162
Yes, sir.

01:04:15.663 --> 01:04:19.207
Look, I know we already had a
fight, but any word on another one?

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.666
I just want to make sure
we're capitalizing

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.501
on everything we got
going on here.

01:04:22.586 --> 01:04:25.171
I told you, if you like,
anything I got,

01:04:25.255 --> 01:04:27.381
the tickets, the hats,
the sneakers,

01:04:27.465 --> 01:04:29.967
you can sell those until
I get you another fight,

01:04:30.051 --> 01:04:32.344
if that's what
you want to do.

01:04:32.429 --> 01:04:33.679
Go ahead,
turn around.

01:04:33.763 --> 01:04:34.847
Huh?

01:04:34.931 --> 01:04:36.807
You wanna get paid,
right?

01:04:36.892 --> 01:04:38.601
Go ahead, man, get it,
I ain't gonna rob you.

01:04:38.685 --> 01:04:39.894
I know you're not
gonna rob me,

01:04:39.978 --> 01:04:41.020
'cause you're gonna
turn around.

01:04:41.104 --> 01:04:42.521
After tonight,
you don't trust me?

01:04:42.606 --> 01:04:44.023
Okay, fine.
I've turned around.

01:04:44.107 --> 01:04:45.399
This is me,
all right?

01:04:45.483 --> 01:04:46.692
I've turned around,
go ahead.

01:04:46.776 --> 01:04:48.360
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:48.445 --> 01:04:50.404
I've turned around, go.

01:04:55.118 --> 01:04:57.285
I was with this girl
from the club tonight.

01:04:57.369 --> 01:05:00.580
Keep looking and you're
going to be with her now.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.790
You can turn around now.

01:05:07.213 --> 01:05:08.588
Man, she got a daughter.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:12.467
She's kind of having a little
trouble with the rent, I think.

01:05:12.927 --> 01:05:15.011
I kinda wanted
to help her.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:17.513
Stop smiling at me, I know
what you're going to say.

01:05:17.598 --> 01:05:19.140
Yeah, I bet...

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.809
Why wouldn't I
help her, then?

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:26.356
Beyond the kid and
the need for money...

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.107
Why you gotta break
everything down?

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:31.069
That's your problem, man,
you don't trust nobody.

01:05:31.153 --> 01:05:32.152
Here you go.

01:05:32.237 --> 01:05:34.738
I'm never trusting you,
you and your suitcase.

01:05:34.822 --> 01:05:36.073
My suitcase?

01:05:36.157 --> 01:05:39.201
Yeah, your suitcase
don't trust nobody either.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.578
There's $10,000 right here.

01:05:41.663 --> 01:05:43.747
Yeah. Nice, isn't it?

01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:45.499
I was right, wasn't I?

01:05:47.794 --> 01:05:49.044
Look, I just...

01:05:49.128 --> 01:05:52.547
We shouldn't be selling
tickets and sneakers no more.

01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:57.135
I tell you, we gotta... This
is what we're doing right now.

01:05:58.346 --> 01:05:59.471
So...

01:06:01.015 --> 01:06:04.101
This girl. She works
over at the Marquee?

01:06:06.604 --> 01:06:08.020
Yeah, Zulay.

01:06:09.648 --> 01:06:11.607
Zulay. She's nice, man.

01:06:11.692 --> 01:06:13.359
Zulay.
Yeah.

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:16.112
Okay.

01:06:19.199 --> 01:06:21.367
You get some rest,
all right?

01:06:22.202 --> 01:06:23.661
There's $10,000
right here.

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:26.539
Yeah. Get some rest,
all right?

01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:19.132
Hey, you know
where Zulay is?

01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:35.731
What do you want
to talk about?

01:07:35.815 --> 01:07:38.942
Isn't there something
you should be telling me?

01:07:39.486 --> 01:07:41.028
What are you talking
about, Harvey?

01:07:41.112 --> 01:07:43.322
You're gonna
make me say it?

01:07:44.115 --> 01:07:47.326
Why didn't you tell me that
you were sleeping with him?

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:48.786
Why couldn't
you tell me that?

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.871
'Cause I don't have to tell
you everything. That's why.

01:07:50.955 --> 01:07:53.582
Now you want him
paying your bills?

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:55.125
I did not ask him
to pay my bills.

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.209
Are you kidding me?

01:07:56.293 --> 01:08:00.380
You're bringing him around your
daughter, you like him like that?

01:08:01.673 --> 01:08:03.716
What, you think he's
better than me, right?

01:08:03.801 --> 01:08:04.801
No. That's...

01:08:04.885 --> 01:08:05.885
You think you're
better than me,

01:08:05.969 --> 01:08:09.389
that's why you fill his
head with all this garbage.

01:08:09.473 --> 01:08:11.432
About riding off
into the sunset,

01:08:11.517 --> 01:08:13.684
like this is a movie
or something, huh?

01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:15.728
No, no, come here I'm talking
to you. Don't touch me.

01:08:15.813 --> 01:08:16.770
I'm talking to you.

01:08:16.854 --> 01:08:18.856
Don't touch me.
Stop it.

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:21.943
If he decides to up
and leave you tomorrow,

01:08:22.027 --> 01:08:23.694
you think you're
part of his plans?

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:25.988
You think
your daughter is?

01:08:26.115 --> 01:08:28.741
Maybe. What about your grandmother?

01:08:28.826 --> 01:08:29.867
You're always so paranoid.

01:08:29.952 --> 01:08:33.203
Yeah, that's what I am,
I'm paranoid. I'm paranoid.

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:35.705
You still believe
in fairy tales.

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:41.461
But you think
I'm paranoid, okay.

01:08:41.879 --> 01:08:43.839
Does he know
how we met?

01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:47.259
You in the back seat,
sleeping in your car,

01:08:47.343 --> 01:08:49.511
with your daughter
in the front seat?

01:08:51.013 --> 01:08:53.682
Is that something
to be paranoid about?

01:08:59.772 --> 01:09:00.981
Okay.

01:09:01.064 --> 01:09:03.984
You think that little thing
right here between your legs

01:09:04.068 --> 01:09:05.819
is gonna make everything
okay, don't you?

01:09:05.903 --> 01:09:07.778
That's what you think.

01:09:07.863 --> 01:09:09.196
It isn't.

01:09:11.366 --> 01:09:13.242
You use that on him.

01:09:13.743 --> 01:09:16.370
Don't put no more
garbage in his head.

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:27.173
Yo, check this out, yo.

01:09:27.299 --> 01:09:29.675
Check what out, this
dirty-ass crib you got?

01:09:30.844 --> 01:09:32.303
There are bare wires
laying around, man.

01:09:32.386 --> 01:09:33.386
Clean this shit up.

01:09:33.471 --> 01:09:34.971
When was the last time
you cleaned this shit?

01:09:35.055 --> 01:09:37.765
Shut up, bro, I'm about to kick you out.

01:09:38.225 --> 01:09:42.188
Evan Hailey KO's Richards.
It's your man from the club.

01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:44.229
This dude's corny.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:47.817
No, check it. A dude like this
man, you got to take serious, man.

01:09:47.902 --> 01:09:49.652
Yeah, look
how he punches.

01:09:49.737 --> 01:09:52.529
He look like he's punching like a
girl, but those punches hurt, man.

01:09:52.615 --> 01:09:53.948
It's your man, Shawn.
Who is that?

01:09:54.033 --> 01:09:55.492
That's that dude
from the club, bro.

01:09:55.576 --> 01:09:58.119
No, man, he's the real deal.
Yo, Shawn, no disrespect, man,

01:09:58.204 --> 01:10:00.788
he's fighting for real
money in real venues.

01:10:00.873 --> 01:10:03.500
Shawn over here
bullshitting with us.

01:10:50.505 --> 01:10:52.297
Look at you, Harvey.

01:10:52.966 --> 01:10:56.300
You know, you've been doing
that for some time now.

01:11:06.603 --> 01:11:09.355
It's called bi-polar
or manic depressive.

01:11:10.482 --> 01:11:11.983
What? What?

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:13.651
Oh, my God.

01:11:13.735 --> 01:11:16.654
Harvey, come in. Come
in, sit down. Come in.

01:11:16.738 --> 01:11:18.990
We were just talking about
you. Come in, come in.

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:22.535
Special occasion, you
got the suit broke out.

01:11:22.828 --> 01:11:23.828
Nice suit.

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.162
Jacket, at least.

01:11:25.747 --> 01:11:26.956
That's nice.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.583
Beautiful,
you're looking good.

01:11:28.667 --> 01:11:29.667
Not bad, Harvey.

01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:33.003
Listen, I didn't
come here, you know,

01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:34.254
to take up a whole
lot of your time.

01:11:34.338 --> 01:11:35.422
I'm just here
to tell you

01:11:35.506 --> 01:11:37.257
that if you've got
something for Shawn...

01:11:37.341 --> 01:11:39.301
Look at little Harvey,
he's like a little kid.

01:11:39.385 --> 01:11:44.556
He's very excited, like he
has a secret to share with us.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.683
What's the secret,
Harvey?

01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:48.643
I'm just saying, if you...

01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:51.104
If you got something for us,
we're ready to go, you know.

01:11:51.188 --> 01:11:52.689
He's the biggest draw
in this town,

01:11:52.773 --> 01:11:56.109
and if you're ready for
something, we're ready for it.

01:11:56.193 --> 01:11:57.319
Wow.

01:11:58.195 --> 01:12:01.531
It must be very hard for you
to come in here and grovel

01:12:01.616 --> 01:12:05.243
in front of all of us
here. Especially Martinez.

01:12:07.704 --> 01:12:11.915
You know, Jack, I don't have to
stay here and take this from you.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.876
Guess what, Harvey?

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.961
We were talking about
you and we said that

01:12:16.046 --> 01:12:19.006
maybe we should put your
man in one of our fights.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:23.552
A big fight. $100,000
to the winner, Harvey.

01:12:25.138 --> 01:12:27.306
Harvey's excited, huh, Harvey?

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:29.183
You excited, Harvey?

01:12:29.643 --> 01:12:31.226
$100,000.

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:34.730
Evan Hailey's going to
rock your boy's world.

01:12:34.814 --> 01:12:38.150
Time out. He couldn't
wait to tell you that one.

01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:39.777
See, this is the way
it's going to be.

01:12:39.861 --> 01:12:42.780
Evan Hailey versus
Shawn MacArthur.

01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:45.281
And we're going to play
up this whole thing

01:12:45.366 --> 01:12:47.492
about how they went
to the same school,

01:12:47.576 --> 01:12:51.079
you know,
the education rivalry.

01:12:52.164 --> 01:12:54.040
Rivalry for education.

01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:02.382
Okay.
I know.

01:13:04.426 --> 01:13:07.178
As soon as we
get the word out,

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:09.472
the phone's just going
to ring off the hook.

01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:13.559
We'll let both
of you know.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.625
Harvey, you sure you're
ready for this, Harvey?

01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:43.213
Can't help but keep
calling my name, huh?

01:13:43.297 --> 01:13:46.174
I don't know, Harvey,
maybe I'm stupid, you know?

01:13:46.259 --> 01:13:48.385
But I'm not stupid enough to think
that Shawn's going to win this.

01:13:48.469 --> 01:13:49.720
That's stupid, Harvey.
Yeah, really.

01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:51.221
Really?

01:13:51.305 --> 01:13:53.348
You just don't know how
good he is, you know?

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:56.100
Yeah, I do.
That's why I got Evan.

01:13:56.935 --> 01:14:00.521
And the loser gets shit,
Harvey. And you still get shit.

01:14:16.288 --> 01:14:17.872
Hey, man.

01:14:18.498 --> 01:14:21.417
We need to take a walk
and talk for a second.

01:14:24.004 --> 01:14:25.087
Okay.

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:28.382
So you gonna tell me?

01:14:29.217 --> 01:14:31.634
Well, I got you
another fight.

01:14:31.719 --> 01:14:34.053
Yeah? How much?

01:14:36.599 --> 01:14:38.600
$100,000.

01:14:40.436 --> 01:14:41.728
What?

01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:42.854
Yeah.

01:14:46.776 --> 01:14:50.945
They want us to fight
Evan Hailey.

01:14:53.574 --> 01:14:55.366
He's your opponent.

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:57.869
Great.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:06.127
I'm taking all my money and
I'm placing it against us.

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:10.923
You ain't got no money.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:13.467
You have any idea
how much money

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:15.886
I can raise for
something like this?

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.138
Then raise it and
put it on us to win.

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:20.390
People like a guarantee,
Shawn.

01:15:20.475 --> 01:15:21.809
Then guarantee it.

01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:24.186
You saw Jerry,
those Wall Street guys,

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.063
even Martinez would
get in on this.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.272
We're talking
real money.

01:15:27.357 --> 01:15:28.732
No, you're talking
about money.

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:30.108
No, come on, Shawn.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.736
What do you think, there's a
trophy involved in all of this?

01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:35.155
Nobody cares about it.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:39.326
And if we lose, you know we get
nothing. You get that, right?

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.994
What? Come on, Shawn.

01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:43.830
Look, all right, look...

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:46.123
You think I don't
understand that I'm nothing?

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:48.417
I'm nothing, I get it.
I ain't worth nothing.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.670
Nobody said anything like
that. I mean, come on.

01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:52.463
All I'm saying is that
I don't want to lose.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.215
That's all I'm saying
is I don't want to lose.

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:55.299
I'm telling you, Shawn...

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.051
Look, I know it sounds
stupid to you.

01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:59.136
It's stupid.
But that's what I...

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.973
I don't want to do it,
so I won't. Okay?

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.182
Cut all that stuff,
man, listen to me.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:04.308
I mean it.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.519
Listen, listen.
I'm talking to you.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:07.645
Harvey.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.272
What, you gonna hit me?

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:10.356
No, I'm not gonna
hit you... I'm sorry.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.816
You think I'm your
father?

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.610
You're going to slap me around
like I'm your father, huh?

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.404
Okay, okay, I get it.

01:16:16.488 --> 01:16:18.655
You think I don't know
who you are, Shawn.

01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:20.532
What?
I know all about you.

01:16:20.616 --> 01:16:24.286
I said, can the moral
garbage with me, Shawn.

01:16:24.745 --> 01:16:26.496
It don't work here.

01:16:27.707 --> 01:16:30.750
Harvey, you don't ever
talk about my father, okay?

01:16:30.835 --> 01:16:32.460
You gonna hit me?

01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:37.924
You don't ever
talk about my father.

01:16:53.232 --> 01:16:54.565
Hey.

01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:55.733
So you came back.

01:16:55.817 --> 01:16:58.319
You know me, the stalker.

01:16:59.154 --> 01:17:01.572
You caught me
taking a shower.

01:17:02.824 --> 01:17:04.533
So, what are you
doing here?

01:17:04.618 --> 01:17:08.662
Nothing, I was just... I don't
know, just kinda wanted to see you.

01:17:09.414 --> 01:17:10.497
Okay, well, come in.

01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:13.500
My grandmother has
Lila, so, come in.

01:17:17.505 --> 01:17:19.840
I know it's really
hot in here, so,

01:17:19.925 --> 01:17:23.218
if you want, just grab a
seat and I'll be right back.

01:17:23.303 --> 01:17:26.180
Hey, listen.
Look, I made some money

01:17:26.264 --> 01:17:28.641
and I kinda wanted to help
you with the notice that I saw

01:17:28.725 --> 01:17:31.184
on the door the other day.

01:17:31.268 --> 01:17:33.645
That's really... No...
That's sweet, but...

01:17:33.729 --> 01:17:34.729
No. For Lila.

01:17:34.813 --> 01:17:35.897
No, I don't need it.

01:17:35.981 --> 01:17:38.232
Listen, hold on, hold on.
Just for Lila.

01:17:38.317 --> 01:17:40.777
Hold on a second. Just,
please, just listen.

01:17:40.861 --> 01:17:43.363
I don't know what
I'm trying to say...

01:17:43.697 --> 01:17:47.075
The last thing I want
to do is upset you.

01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:48.159
All I want...

01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:52.372
You came in here
offering me money.

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:57.418
Just don't...
It's no big deal, okay?

01:18:01.674 --> 01:18:03.591
I don't know how to...

01:19:07.237 --> 01:19:08.362
What?

01:19:08.989 --> 01:19:10.823
Your hair smells good.

01:19:10.907 --> 01:19:12.158
Thank you.

01:19:13.493 --> 01:19:15.494
You know, when you wash
your hair in the sink,

01:19:15.579 --> 01:19:17.496
they call it
a Puerto Rican shower.

01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:20.707
My grandfather used to hate
when people called it that.

01:19:20.791 --> 01:19:22.751
Of course, he can say it.

01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:31.676
I like this,
this is nice.

01:19:33.637 --> 01:19:36.306
I know what
happened with your dad.

01:19:38.142 --> 01:19:39.225
Oh.

01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:40.351
Is that okay?

01:19:40.436 --> 01:19:43.229
I read... Me and Lila
were on the computer,

01:19:43.314 --> 01:19:45.398
and we just kinda
stumbled across...

01:19:49.528 --> 01:19:50.570
Wow...
I'm sorry...

01:19:50.654 --> 01:19:54.073
No... Checking up on me?
That's all right.

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.365
It's okay?

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:56.492
Yeah.

01:19:57.535 --> 01:19:59.745
So you think
I'm crazy now?

01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:02.122
No.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.501
Well, I mean...
You'd be right.

01:20:05.585 --> 01:20:08.462
I mean, I did. I went
a little crazy, so...

01:20:10.423 --> 01:20:13.467
You know that guy Evan,
the other night,

01:20:13.551 --> 01:20:14.885
at the club, you know,
after the whole thing?

01:20:14.969 --> 01:20:16.178
Yeah.

01:20:16.971 --> 01:20:20.265
We were on the same team
and my dad coached us.

01:20:20.350 --> 01:20:22.101
Man, he loved Evan.

01:20:22.769 --> 01:20:25.938
I was a freshman, and they
always used to mess with me.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:29.525
And I just couldn't take it
no more. I kind of lost it.

01:20:30.609 --> 01:20:34.237
And me and Evan went at it.
And my dad got between us

01:20:34.321 --> 01:20:35.905
and I didn't even
see him, you know.

01:20:35.989 --> 01:20:38.366
I just kinda...
I hit him.

01:20:39.243 --> 01:20:40.785
I hit my father.

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:43.913
And I just didn't stop.

01:20:43.997 --> 01:20:46.374
You know?
I just couldn't stop.

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.839
My father never forgave
me. 'Cause he shouldn't.

01:20:57.761 --> 01:20:59.595
I got to go get that.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.691
Okay, I have
to get going

01:21:12.775 --> 01:21:15.652
because I have to go do something
at the club, I realized. I'm sorry.

01:21:15.736 --> 01:21:17.487
I have to go and do
something at the club

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:19.322
that I completely
forgot about. So...

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:20.407
Okay...
Please hurry up.

01:21:20.491 --> 01:21:21.491
I'll walk you.
I'm hurrying.

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.993
We do have to go.
I'm sorry, I just...

01:21:23.077 --> 01:21:25.829
Okay. I heard you the first
time, I'm going, I'm going.

01:21:25.913 --> 01:21:27.038
I'm sorry.

01:21:27.123 --> 01:21:28.206
It's okay.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.377
I just forgot I had to
go get this stuff done.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:35.755
You okay?

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.507
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:39.134
Just wondering.

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.970
You're good?
Yeah.

01:21:46.933 --> 01:21:48.392
Hey, Harvey.

01:21:49.311 --> 01:21:51.604
Wait. What?
What's going on here?

01:21:51.688 --> 01:21:52.730
Um...

01:21:52.814 --> 01:21:55.566
I was going to tell
you, I know Harvey.

01:21:56.276 --> 01:21:59.069
Wait, hold on. You all know each other?

01:21:59.362 --> 01:22:02.406
Yeah, I know her.
I know her.

01:22:05.869 --> 01:22:06.952
Listen...
Wait, how do you know...

01:22:07.037 --> 01:22:09.663
I mean, how do you
know each other?

01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:13.918
What's going on, 'cause, are
you together or something?

01:22:14.002 --> 01:22:15.711
No.
Listen, Shawn...

01:22:15.795 --> 01:22:17.213
No, no, no...
I'm talking to her...

01:22:17.297 --> 01:22:18.296
I'm talking...

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.215
No, no, let me... I just
want to hear it from her.

01:22:20.299 --> 01:22:21.507
Let me talk
to you, okay?

01:22:21.592 --> 01:22:24.052
What did I say? I said
I'm talking... What now?

01:22:24.136 --> 01:22:26.012
Shawn...
I want to talk to her.

01:22:26.096 --> 01:22:27.597
I'm talking to you.
I want to talk to her!

01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:28.681
Get your hands off me!
Shut up!

01:22:28.807 --> 01:22:31.226
Get your hands off of
me! Get out of my head!

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:33.603
Look, everything
isn't what you think.

01:22:33.687 --> 01:22:35.730
You're not the only one
that worked with me.

01:22:35.814 --> 01:22:36.940
She works with me, too.

01:22:37.024 --> 01:22:38.858
It's what I was explaining
at the apartment.

01:22:38.943 --> 01:22:42.487
Nobody knows we know each
other. She places bets for me.

01:22:43.572 --> 01:22:44.572
Okay, that's
what it is.

01:22:44.657 --> 01:22:46.783
I was going to
tell you, Shawn.

01:22:46.867 --> 01:22:50.078
You asked about my...
You asked about my father.

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:53.081
Shawn...
Why would you do that?

01:23:00.838 --> 01:23:03.298
You better learn
to answer your phone.

01:23:03.383 --> 01:23:04.716
Why didn't you answer?
That's all you had to do.

01:23:04.801 --> 01:23:05.759
Why did you call?

01:23:05.843 --> 01:23:08.720
Why didn't you text me
and say something?

01:23:47.926 --> 01:23:50.219
Listen, Harvey and I have been
friends for a really long time.

01:23:50.304 --> 01:23:53.431
Listen to me. I should
have told you, I know that.

01:23:53.515 --> 01:23:54.473
I don't know what I
might say to you, okay.

01:23:54.558 --> 01:23:57.893
Wait. Just listen
to me, okay?

01:23:57.978 --> 01:24:00.354
Look, I make $11
an hour, okay?

01:24:00.439 --> 01:24:01.605
Is that what you
want to know?

01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.774
I make $11 an hour,
I'm broke.

01:24:03.859 --> 01:24:06.318
I pick up glasses from people
that I hate all night long,

01:24:06.402 --> 01:24:10.238
and I'm not really supposed
to be doing this right now.

01:24:10.948 --> 01:24:13.366
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

01:24:15.661 --> 01:24:16.911
Because.

01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:25.086
Harvey... We're just friends.
He just gives me this money,

01:24:26.422 --> 01:24:29.007
and I just go place bets for him
and that's all there is to it.

01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:30.633
Nobody even knows that
we know each other.

01:24:30.718 --> 01:24:33.553
Then why couldn't you
just say that to me?

01:24:52.572 --> 01:24:54.490
Is this thing still on?

01:24:57.619 --> 01:24:59.328
Listen, man...

01:24:59.412 --> 01:25:00.579
Yeah, I understand.

01:25:01.581 --> 01:25:04.541
Throw it. No one will
ever know the better.

01:25:06.586 --> 01:25:10.047
And you're going to tell me
you're okay with that, huh?

01:25:12.384 --> 01:25:13.509
Yeah.

01:25:14.636 --> 01:25:16.969
Whatever you raise,
I want half.

01:25:20.432 --> 01:25:22.892
We ain't talking about
anything here, you know.

01:25:22.976 --> 01:25:24.727
No, forget it, then.

01:25:25.979 --> 01:25:27.063
Okay.

01:25:27.648 --> 01:25:28.648
Just like that,
though, huh?

01:25:28.732 --> 01:25:31.192
Yeah. Just like that.

01:25:34.655 --> 01:25:36.030
All right.

01:25:36.824 --> 01:25:39.575
Then, you know once
you get out there,

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.869
all those eyes are
going to be on you.

01:25:42.663 --> 01:25:46.541
And if there's even a hint that
you're throwing this thing...

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.709
And that's
both of us dead.

01:25:49.962 --> 01:25:51.587
You understand
how much money they...

01:25:51.672 --> 01:25:55.924
They don't scare me, Harvey.
This city doesn't scare me.

01:25:58.344 --> 01:26:02.472
I'm gonna do what you want. And
you're never going to see me again.

01:26:03.933 --> 01:26:05.350
None of you.

01:26:24.162 --> 01:26:26.371
This isn't tickets,
Harvey.

01:26:26.456 --> 01:26:29.415
You understand there's
$250,000 in this bag.

01:26:34.796 --> 01:26:38.048
And, Harvey, don't make
us come looking for you.

01:26:53.231 --> 01:26:55.065
Nice office, Harvey.

01:26:55.692 --> 01:26:56.942
Glad you could
make it.

01:26:57.027 --> 01:26:59.528
Yeah, you should
get a receptionist.

01:27:01.573 --> 01:27:04.158
Is he going to listen
to you, Harvey?

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:08.328
If you don't believe me, he's right
out there, you can ask him yourself.

01:27:08.412 --> 01:27:10.288
I'm asking you,
Harvey.

01:27:13.918 --> 01:27:16.544
There's $250,000
in here.

01:27:17.296 --> 01:27:20.006
And if he decides
he don't like losing,

01:27:20.090 --> 01:27:23.760
and by some miracle he wins,
I still want my money, Harvey.

01:27:29.808 --> 01:27:32.769
I don't get my money,
Harvey, I'll kill you.

01:27:49.577 --> 01:27:51.078
Lot of money.

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.054
Come on in.

01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:56.516
Zulay, did you have
another dream?

01:28:57.393 --> 01:28:58.768
It's a lot of money,
Jack.

01:28:58.853 --> 01:29:00.103
Oh, yeah?

01:29:02.732 --> 01:29:05.025
How much are we
talking about?

01:29:05.276 --> 01:29:07.193
Half a million dollars.

01:29:08.613 --> 01:29:09.779
Hmm?

01:29:11.365 --> 01:29:13.783
So what are you doing
walking around the street

01:29:13.868 --> 01:29:16.161
with half a million dollars
in your bag?

01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:19.247
I have investors.

01:29:19.332 --> 01:29:20.373
Investors.

01:29:22.209 --> 01:29:23.835
If it's too much
money, I can...

01:29:23.919 --> 01:29:25.128
Too much?

01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:27.505
Listen to that.

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:31.550
She's cleaning up the
dumpster, now she's in the club.

01:29:35.722 --> 01:29:40.267
Tell your rich-ass and your
drunk-ass investor friends

01:29:40.352 --> 01:29:43.520
that I will be happy
to pay them off.

01:29:45.523 --> 01:29:47.274
And happier not to.

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:53.906
Count it.

01:30:41.244 --> 01:30:43.412
The man
is here. Outside.

01:30:47.417 --> 01:30:50.210
We need to get everybody out on
the terrace so we can do this thing.

01:30:50.294 --> 01:30:52.713
People, the show's
going to start. Outside.

01:30:52.797 --> 01:30:54.840
You have a nice place here. Of course.

01:30:54.924 --> 01:30:57.426
City Hall, I've got
the Woolworth Building.

01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:59.302
My meditation room.

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:01.513
Let's go, people.

01:31:11.482 --> 01:31:13.233
Look, I'll meet you out.

01:31:13.317 --> 01:31:15.068
Let me talk to you
for a second.

01:31:15.153 --> 01:31:16.736
You know what we're
dealing with here, right?

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.488
Let's just go.
Let's get it over with.

01:31:43.305 --> 01:31:45.139
Look at this, Harvey.

01:31:47.476 --> 01:31:49.852
Now you see how far
you've come?

01:31:55.733 --> 01:31:57.150
Hey, everybody,

01:31:57.234 --> 01:31:59.235
Jerry invited us all
up here so we could

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.863
catch a glimpse of
his bank account.

01:32:01.947 --> 01:32:03.406
That's nice, huh?

01:32:04.825 --> 01:32:06.409
Here's to Jerry.

01:32:08.704 --> 01:32:10.622
But what
the thing is...

01:32:10.706 --> 01:32:12.665
I mean, the real shit
of this thing is,

01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:14.959
is what's going on
right here.

01:32:15.711 --> 01:32:18.546
So, Jerry, right now,
you should step off.

01:32:19.965 --> 01:32:22.425
And gentlemen,
you should step up.

01:32:24.887 --> 01:32:26.679
Let's go baby, let's go!

01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:32.684
We're going
to sit down, people.

01:32:33.394 --> 01:32:36.730
And these two gentlemen are going
to go toe to toe, blow to blow.

01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:41.318
Whatever goes on
up here, whatever.

01:32:43.238 --> 01:32:46.365
Whatever you do to
each other, whatever.

01:32:49.744 --> 01:32:52.663
Whatever you say to
each other, whatever.

01:32:55.124 --> 01:32:59.127
In the words of the late,
great, American poet,

01:32:59.212 --> 01:33:01.380
Mr. Marvin Gaye,

01:33:01.464 --> 01:33:06.551
"Let's get it on!"

01:33:10.514 --> 01:33:13.724
Let's go, baby,
let's go! Yeah!

01:33:15.894 --> 01:33:18.312
You froze? Huh?

01:33:19.648 --> 01:33:21.607
It's a stare-down.

01:33:23.235 --> 01:33:24.277
Oh.

01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:26.445
It's the evil eye.

01:33:30.409 --> 01:33:33.244
Is that what you gave
your old man? Huh?

01:33:33.328 --> 01:33:35.538
Knock that smile
off his face, let's go!

01:33:45.339 --> 01:33:46.715
Yeah, baby!

01:33:52.096 --> 01:33:55.473
All right. Let's play.
Let's play, Shawn.

01:33:56.017 --> 01:33:58.268
Show him what
you got! Do it!

01:33:59.645 --> 01:34:01.104
Do it, baby!

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.691
Go on, Shawn! Yeah!

01:34:38.266 --> 01:34:40.684
Get him, Shawn!
Get him! Get him!

01:34:49.194 --> 01:34:50.861
Right here, Shawn.

01:34:54.073 --> 01:34:55.740
He's talking shit!

01:34:59.912 --> 01:35:02.038
You can't stay there,
Shawn!

01:35:21.433 --> 01:35:22.725
Oh, shit!

01:35:32.902 --> 01:35:34.861
Hey, hey,
that's it! That's it!

01:35:34.946 --> 01:35:38.031
That's it! That's it!
That's enough! Call it!

01:35:40.326 --> 01:35:42.160
That's it! That's it!

01:35:44.372 --> 01:35:46.748
Go on, Shawn!
Get up! Get up, bro!

01:35:52.171 --> 01:35:55.757
Get up! Get up!

01:35:58.428 --> 01:36:02.431
Get out of it! Get out of it! Get out!

01:36:03.598 --> 01:36:05.141
Come on, Shawn!

01:36:09.104 --> 01:36:11.814
You got to fight!
Come on! Get out of it!

01:36:15.277 --> 01:36:16.485
Fight!

01:36:28.915 --> 01:36:31.000
Come on, Shawn! Yeah!

01:36:38.467 --> 01:36:39.716
No! No!

01:36:44.263 --> 01:36:46.097
Harvey, what's
going on, Harvey?

01:36:46.182 --> 01:36:47.223
No!

01:36:47.725 --> 01:36:49.267
Come on! Yeah!

01:36:50.728 --> 01:36:52.103
Holy shit!

01:37:28.264 --> 01:37:29.348
No!

01:37:49.661 --> 01:37:50.993
Yeah, boy!

01:37:56.875 --> 01:37:58.292
Yeah, Shawn!
Yeah, Shawn!

01:37:58.377 --> 01:38:00.503
You got it, Shawn.
Let's start moving, boys.

01:38:04.216 --> 01:38:05.341
Yeah!

01:38:05.425 --> 01:38:07.093
What up now, bitch?

01:38:07.678 --> 01:38:10.513
Harvey, I'd like to
shake your hand, man.

01:38:14.393 --> 01:38:16.060
You're a dead man.

01:38:16.812 --> 01:38:19.355
You're a dead man,
Harvey. Dead man.

01:38:19.439 --> 01:38:20.565
Thank you.

01:38:20.649 --> 01:38:21.732
You're welcome.

01:38:23.694 --> 01:38:25.444
What up now, bitch?

01:38:29.615 --> 01:38:30.991
Yeah, baby!

01:38:46.257 --> 01:38:49.050
I'll need a drink
after that, man, right!

01:39:00.396 --> 01:39:03.105
Thank you, Evan,
you fight like a bitch.

01:39:03.190 --> 01:39:06.567
Harvey, we're going out,
VIP Harvey, we out of here.

01:39:06.651 --> 01:39:09.153
Whoa, there he is!

01:39:11.364 --> 01:39:12.573
You're the shit, man.

01:39:12.657 --> 01:39:15.701
Yeah, last night was
great, man. Thanks a lot.

01:39:15.785 --> 01:39:16.911
Thanks for the ride.

01:39:16.995 --> 01:39:18.329
Thanks for
being there.

01:39:18.413 --> 01:39:20.456
Yo, we're going to the club
tonight, kid. You wanna come?

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.249
VIP all night,
drinks all night.

01:39:22.334 --> 01:39:23.500
Come on. Let's go.

01:39:23.585 --> 01:39:24.543
No, I'm beat up.

01:39:24.628 --> 01:39:26.629
VIP, Harvey. VIP.

01:39:27.047 --> 01:39:29.381
VIP, you all
be careful.

01:39:36.681 --> 01:39:39.349
Well, tonight,
show your butt off.

01:39:41.477 --> 01:39:47.023
You know, I'd be lying if I didn't
say, secretly I wanted you to win.

01:39:48.776 --> 01:39:50.526
That's crazy, right?

01:39:51.362 --> 01:39:54.447
If I wasn't a dead man,
I'd be happy, you know.

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.909
But you killed me
with that, Shawn.

01:39:59.703 --> 01:40:03.414
You know, you do what
you do, you know.

01:40:04.541 --> 01:40:06.793
Look, Shawn,
in a couple of minutes

01:40:06.877 --> 01:40:09.337
there's going to be some men
that's going to come here,

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:12.507
and you can't be here
when they get here, okay?

01:40:33.778 --> 01:40:36.405
Me and Zulay,
we put it on us to win.

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:38.407
Yeah.

01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:40.784
We knew you'd
never go for it,

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:43.537
so we didn't say
nothing, but...

01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:53.170
There's $1 million
in there.

01:40:59.928 --> 01:41:02.346
Business ready
for business, huh?

01:41:02.889 --> 01:41:04.140
Business ready.

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.516
You taught me that.

01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:07.143
Okay.

01:41:15.277 --> 01:41:17.570
That's a lot of
money in there.

01:41:17.946 --> 01:41:19.071
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:22.366
No, I'm not kidding, Shawn.
That's a lot of money.

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:27.245
That's a lot of IHOPs.
We're going to Birmingham.

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:28.830
Okay...

01:41:28.914 --> 01:41:31.249
You know, we're going
to go and see my family.

01:41:31.334 --> 01:41:34.294
See what's left of it.
You know what I mean?

01:41:34.962 --> 01:41:38.131
Maybe stop by Chicago,
or something.

01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:42.344
On your way to
Birmingham, Chicago.

01:41:42.428 --> 01:41:43.762
Right. Yeah.

01:41:44.221 --> 01:41:45.430
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:49.601
Why don't you come?

01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:08.118
So Birmingham is
where you're thinking?

01:42:08.203 --> 01:42:10.287
Yeah.
It's where I'm from.

01:42:12.749 --> 01:42:15.084
Okay, what we
should do, then...

01:42:16.336 --> 01:42:17.378
Hear me out.

01:42:17.462 --> 01:42:20.923
I think we should go past
Birmingham to some place warm.

01:42:21.007 --> 01:42:22.549
If you're going all the way to Chicago,

01:42:22.634 --> 01:42:24.885
through Birmingham,
whatever...

01:42:24.969 --> 01:42:26.053
Take it to California.

01:42:26.137 --> 01:42:28.931
You know, they've got a whole lot
of great opportunities out there.

01:42:29.015 --> 01:42:30.349
I've been doing
a lot of reading,

01:42:30.433 --> 01:42:32.434
I'm not giving those
people this money.

01:42:32.519 --> 01:42:34.561
I don't give...
Unless...

01:42:35.605 --> 01:42:38.564
We shouldn't give nobody none
of this. We should just go.

01:42:38.649 --> 01:42:40.108
"'I believe in love,'
said Grandma,

01:42:40.192 --> 01:42:43.027
"I'm going to go to Africa
because my boyfriend is there.

01:42:43.112 --> 01:42:46.948
"And then I change my mind,
maybe. Because love is beautiful. "

01:42:47.491 --> 01:42:49.325
Oh, my God.
It's amazing, Alabama.

01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:53.746
Alabama. Alabama. All the
time, Alabama, Alabama, Alabama.

01:42:53.831 --> 01:42:54.914
Would you
all shut up already?

01:42:54.998 --> 01:42:55.998
You're driving me crazy.

01:42:56.083 --> 01:42:58.668
You're making
my ears bleed in here.
