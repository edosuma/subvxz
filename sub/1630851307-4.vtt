00:05.088 --> 00:06.006
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:07.090 --> 00:08.133
I hurt my knee last night.

00:08.174 --> 00:09.300
Our chef injured himself.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.760
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

00:10.802 --> 00:12.095
Is this your first boat?

00:12.137 --> 00:13.304
First big boat.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.681
Is that jet ski
tied onto something?

00:14.723 --> 00:16.099
Ugh!

00:16.141 --> 00:17.434
Someone forgot to tie
the jet ski up.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.394
[bleep]
I'm just an idiot!

00:19.436 --> 00:20.687
Get on with Lloyd, please.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.522
A boat with no dishwasher.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.857
Why?

00:23.898 --> 00:25.775
I have fried brains right now.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.277
Hey, Mom.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.529
A couple months ago,
my dad died.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.615
It's making
the job 600 times harder.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.284
Mathew better be back.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.452
Is he gonna be back to do,
like, a platter?

00:35.493 --> 00:37.162
I need to talk to Sandy.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.747
<i>I'd love to come back</i>
<i>and start fresh.</i>

00:38.788 --> 00:40.457
Yes.

00:40.498 --> 00:44.252
Is Mathew capable of continuing
in the charter season?

00:44.294 --> 00:45.795
You're stepping
right in my piles.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.339
Don't worry about
the ----ing dirt.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.174
Just tell Mat,
I want more lamb pops.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.134
Yeah, he's plating
some more lamb now.

00:51.176 --> 00:55.138
You don't touch anything until
you're sure the guests are done.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.890
Focus on putting
the lamb on the plate.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.433
You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.893
I'm in charge of the galley,
all right?

00:59.934 --> 01:00.894
-I know, but I'm saying...
-Never again.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.103
Never again.
Get out.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.733
I definitely have
a crush on Courtney.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.568
The other side of
Z is coming out.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.696
She... I swept a pile of dirt
and she stood in that.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.781
Okay. Okay...

01:12.822 --> 01:14.908
-But then I told you...
-Shh!

01:14.949 --> 01:16.826
We're working with people
who we wouldn't even speak to

01:16.868 --> 01:18.453
in normal circumstances.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.413
You wouldn't speak to me
in normal circumstance?

01:20.455 --> 01:21.456
You wouldn't speak to me.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.791
Let's not talk about it.

01:46.398 --> 01:49.484
You wouldn't speak to me.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.152
And you're not
the person I'd speak to.

01:53.571 --> 01:56.700
I think fifth charter in,
we'll hate each other the most.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.412
Mathew is a
poke-the-bear person,

02:00.453 --> 02:02.372
but doesn't know when to,
like, chill out.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.624
I think he feels as if
we're still mad at him,

02:04.666 --> 02:06.668
and really, we're just
trying to blow off steam

02:06.710 --> 02:07.836
as we drop
the charter guests off.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.549
-So, anyway...
-Anyway...

02:12.590 --> 02:13.800
This is one thing
I've hated about boats,

02:13.842 --> 02:14.801
is the hierarchy thing.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.511
Like, I respect it, but...

02:20.348 --> 02:21.474
They're on their own
with this one.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.309
This is ----ing bullsh--.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.311
Until something's
a little bit more serious,

02:25.353 --> 02:26.771
maybe I'll have
something to say.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.773
But right now, I don't care.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.234
I actually never wanted
to become a chief stew

02:31.276 --> 02:32.902
because there's such a persona
about being a chief stew.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.654
Yeah.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.655
Everyone's, like,
oh, she's gonna be a bitch,

02:35.697 --> 02:37.490
she's gonna be a bitch.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.492
That's because so many
chief stews are ----ing bitches.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.869
I'm just not that person.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.621
You can be a good human
and work in yachting.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.665
-Anyway...
-So, anyway, Daddy...

02:47.459 --> 02:48.877
-Okay, let's do it.
-Yeah, baby.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.339
All right, bye forever.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.257
Okay.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.759
He is weird.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.385
I honestly don't know
if he's gonna murder us.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.636
I think he'll take me out first.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.640
He's just like...

03:02.682 --> 03:04.225
Read the ----ing room dude.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.645
and he doesn't get it.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.487
You wanna sit?

03:15.528 --> 03:16.863
I can sit on your knee
if you want.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.782
Yes, please.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.867
Oh, yeah, I'll sit on him
because it's his birthday.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.495
Whoa, happy birthday, Z.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.462
That's my American accent.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.756
Yeah, let's go, Daddy.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.049
Did you ever think, like,
that side of the table's

03:36.091 --> 03:37.300
probably, like...

03:40.762 --> 03:42.555
-Have you?
-Once.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.474
-It's a vibe thing, right?
-It is a vibe thing.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.475
Like, if you have a vibe
with someone,

03:45.517 --> 03:46.851
then you're, like, yeah.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.354
It's important.
It's very important.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.563
On the first day,
you were terrifying.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.399
Really?

03:52.440 --> 03:53.608
Like, I was, like, very, like,
shy and nervous when I came on.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.693
Because I, like...

03:54.734 --> 03:55.985
oh, you wanted to be, like--

03:56.027 --> 03:57.737
Yeah, you were.
Now it's opening up.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.406
Would you like to be
part of the

03:59.447 --> 04:00.949
get-loose get Goose deckhand
Tiktok?

04:00.990 --> 04:02.867
-Yeah, what are we doing?
-We're gonna be, like,

04:02.909 --> 04:04.369
* There's too many men,
too many, many men *

04:04.411 --> 04:05.704
* Too many men,
too many, many men *

04:05.745 --> 04:07.455
* We need some more girls
in here *

04:07.497 --> 04:09.040
* Too many men, too many men,
too many many men *

04:09.082 --> 04:10.834
* We need some more
girls in here *

04:10.875 --> 04:13.837
You sound like a little
----ing dirty, like, emcee.

04:13.878 --> 04:14.963
One of my nicknames is Goose.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.925
I'm normally, like...

04:18.967 --> 04:20.760
Me and my best made have
a weird obsession with geese,

04:20.802 --> 04:23.430
so we have a little tattoo.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.931
We work together around Europe,

04:24.973 --> 04:27.767
had a little chant about
getting loose, getting goose...

04:27.809 --> 04:29.936
When the goose gets loose,
that's the night out.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.771
-Yo, Lloyd.
-Yes.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.772
You know it.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.482
Yeah, let's go, Daddy.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.988
Party in the master.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.952
Bitch, you hurt your
----ing kneecap!

04:51.499 --> 04:52.667
Ah!

04:56.171 --> 04:57.505
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.757
Oh sh--.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.595
-Okay.
-Ah!

05:03.636 --> 05:04.637
Happy birthday.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.766
Yo, yo!

05:07.807 --> 05:09.517
I want to mix it up.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.353
Everyone always parties in
the Jacuzzi and the sundeck,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.480
so yeah, master cabin it is.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.814
I'll be the one cleaning it,

05:14.856 --> 05:17.442
so if I regret it,
it's on me, right?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.945
Ms. Bahamas got her shorts on!

05:20.987 --> 05:23.031
Ah! Ah!

05:25.784 --> 05:29.120
-Hey!
-Get it, Court!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.456
Woo!

05:35.543 --> 05:38.004
I tried to teach myself how
to twerk when I was, like,

05:38.046 --> 05:40.048
16, by watching
YouTube videos.

05:40.090 --> 05:43.051
I stood in my room,
in my pajamas,

05:43.093 --> 05:45.887
and honestly twerked
way more than anybody

05:45.929 --> 05:48.014
should have ever
twerked on my own.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.433
It was just something that
I wanted to be able to do,

05:50.475 --> 05:52.686
because it's cool.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
It's your birthday, Dad-Z!

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
Yeah, yeah!

05:57.107 --> 05:58.566
I don't know where candles are,

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
but should we just
bring it up to him?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.194
Yes, Daddy!

06:01.236 --> 06:04.030
-What's most important is Z...
-Happy birthday.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.909
Happy birthday to ya!

06:07.951 --> 06:09.035
Guys!

06:09.077 --> 06:10.745
You got a cheesecake!

06:14.124 --> 06:15.792
-Never!
-Woo!

06:15.834 --> 06:16.918
-I'm so excited, actually.
-You are amazing.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.545
Thank you, thank you.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.629
Oh, it's falling off now.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.922
You ----ed it up, okay?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.757
We're going to have
to go without.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.551
Malia's amazing.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.553
I mean, obviously,
she's my boss,

06:26.594 --> 06:28.722
so the negative is you
go for it, it doesn't work out,

06:28.763 --> 06:30.807
and then you might be
left with this awkward

06:30.849 --> 06:32.600
kind of ooh, like, ooh...

06:32.642 --> 06:34.144
-No, I don't want any.
-Honestly, now, you have to.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.439
But if you don't go,
you never know.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.944
-Hey!
-Woo!

06:42.986 --> 06:44.571
Yes, Lloyd!

06:46.072 --> 06:47.532
[shouting]

06:50.869 --> 06:53.121
I am not drunk at all.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.750
[laughing]

06:56.791 --> 06:58.501
I'm so confused.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.711
Yeah.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.129
Ooh!
Sh--!

07:04.549 --> 07:06.134
Seriously, Mom,
pick up the phone.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.510
[groans]

07:08.511 --> 07:09.846
Oh, my God.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.476
Yes, Daddy!

07:14.517 --> 07:16.269
Daddy, get you some!

07:16.311 --> 07:18.563
Night out number one.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.148
Ugh, what's going on?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.109
Three, two, one.
Oop.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.736
Woo, woo!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.488
You guys should have sex.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.490
Woo!

07:28.531 --> 07:29.949
Coming up...

07:29.991 --> 07:31.910
I'm riding high, and I
am just in a great mood.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.788
Nothing can go wrong, and it's
going to be the best day ever.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.748
[singing]

07:37.832 --> 07:38.792
Holy sh--.

07:42.754 --> 07:42.962
Ooh!

07:43.672 --> 07:45.048
[bleep]

07:47.634 --> 07:49.135
Seriously, Mom,
pick up the phone.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.679
[groans]

07:52.055 --> 07:53.682
Yes, Daddy!

07:53.723 --> 07:55.225
Daddy, get you some!

07:55.266 --> 07:56.935
Ugh! What's going on?

08:00.105 --> 08:01.731
Three, two, one.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.027
Pull it together, Mzi.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.071
I was not expecting that kiss.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.662
Going to bed.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.830
[bleep]

08:16.871 --> 08:18.832
Okay, babe, bye.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.208
-Where are you going?
-To the crew mess.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.751
-Meh.
-Meh.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.044
-Meh.
-Meh.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.754
Went for a wee.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.715
Tonight was fun, right?
Did you have a great birthday?

08:26.756 --> 08:27.882
Thank you guys, genuinely.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.718
You got a lap dance.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.806
<i>-Hi.</i>
-Mummy?

08:34.848 --> 08:38.268
I've seriously been drinking way
too much, but it is what it is.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.772
I haven't drunken anything.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.774
Is that even a word?
I didn't drink anything else.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.319
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna
call you later.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.864
I'm going to bed,
because it's late.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.825
Oh, I'm so ----ing tired.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.412
Did she not support
your decision?

08:57.454 --> 09:00.040
My mom is, like,
old-school Christian...

09:00.081 --> 09:01.833
drink your way to hell.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.793
You do anything else,
you're just gonna go to hell.

09:03.835 --> 09:08.048
No, my mom is, like, so...
a strict Christian as well.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.758
I think she's just holding on
to me because my dad,

09:09.799 --> 09:11.426
like, just passed away.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.303
So she's just, like, "I have
to keep control over you."

09:13.345 --> 09:15.055
And I'm like,
"Mom...

09:15.096 --> 09:17.640
Your dad just passed away,
like, within a year, or...

09:17.682 --> 09:19.934
Like, three months ago.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.811
Holy sh--, Lexi.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.273
Yeah, so I'm still,
like, unstable.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.941
Are you okay?

09:34.824 --> 09:37.243
That's very sudden, and
you don't have to be okay.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.703
No, I'm okay.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.959
Oh, he was.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.002
He really was.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.316
Hey, big boy.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.734
How are you?

10:11.861 --> 10:13.947
-I'm dying.
-Why did we drink so much?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.740
Kill me.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.826
<i>Deck crew, can you meet me</i>
<i>on the main deck aft?</i>

10:17.867 --> 10:19.452
<i>Copy that.</i>

10:19.494 --> 10:21.079
Hey, Courts.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.163
-Good, thanks, how are you?
-Good, thank you.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.457
Katie?

10:24.499 --> 10:25.709
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hey.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.877
What up?

10:27.919 --> 10:30.964
All right, so today,
pay attention

10:31.006 --> 10:33.383
to master cabin windows
and bridge windows, please.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.968
Yeah.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.846
I wanna seem helpful,
but not overly helpful.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.140
Like, I do wanna be helpful,
but not in a like,

10:40.181 --> 10:41.975
"I'm into you, like,
let me be helpful."

10:42.017 --> 10:45.478
So it's, like...
like, come closer but stay far.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.355
Definitely, definitely,
definitely gotta give the hull

10:47.397 --> 10:48.982
a real good rinse today.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.316
Sweet.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.279
Stop it!

10:56.865 --> 10:58.241
Why?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.826
What do you remember and
what don't you remember?

10:59.868 --> 11:00.869
I remember...
I literally remember it all.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.371
Z, how are you feeling?

11:03.413 --> 11:04.873
You kissed Z.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.793
-Yeah, I heard that.
-I did not kiss Z!

11:08.835 --> 11:10.128
We kissed last night?

11:10.170 --> 11:13.757
What? No!
We kissed last night?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.258
No, we didn't!

11:18.136 --> 11:19.888
Oh, my God.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.056
[bleep]

11:21.097 --> 11:22.182
Are you in love now, Z?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.438
Boat romances...
watch out, they're dangerous.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.443
Malia, Katie, and Mathew,

11:33.485 --> 11:35.779
meet me in the crew mess for
a preference sheet meeting.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.906
Copy that.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.032
Look at you.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.535
Oh!

11:42.577 --> 11:44.245
Roy Orbison, Jr.
and his wife, Asa,

11:44.287 --> 11:45.955
are repeat charter guests.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.500
I love his dad, big fan.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.293
Along with
their two toddlers, Roy III,

11:50.335 --> 11:52.087
age four, and Bo, age two.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.214
Joining the Orbisons
are their friends

11:54.255 --> 11:56.049
from Sweden and
their nanny, Rebekah.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.927
Do they like espresso martinis?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.096
No, they're super chilled,
actually, yeah.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.348
This group is looking forward
to plenty of non-alcoholic beer

12:03.390 --> 12:05.392
and champagne so the
non-drinkers can feel like...

12:05.433 --> 12:06.893
-Yes!
-Part of the fun.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.478
The whole group,
including the young boys,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.313
are looking forward to jet skis

12:10.355 --> 12:13.608
and spending time on all of the
water toys whenever possible.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.110
This will be a
shorter charter,

12:15.151 --> 12:16.111
so let's make
every minute count.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.445
Yeah.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.530
Weather is gonna be
incredible, actually.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.614
-Is it?
-Oh, nice, awesome.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.324
Yeah.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.325
When we have shorter charters
with returning guests,

12:22.367 --> 12:23.952
it's like jam-packed,

12:23.993 --> 12:25.370
and the crew really
have to be on their toes.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.371
-Cool.
-All right, cool.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.455
All right, thank you, guys.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.456
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.457
Cool.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.959
This side's done.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.502
Actually, those
have gotta be fulled... filled.

12:35.422 --> 12:39.259
I need two cribs
for our next trip.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.345
-Hi.
-Morning.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.471
Just walk it there, please.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.515
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.479
And we were wondering if
it's possible to get

12:51.521 --> 12:54.441
a few musicians to
perform for our guests.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.151
Cool, thank you very much.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.988
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>
<i>provisions on the dock.</i>

13:00.030 --> 13:01.239
Ah.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.366
Who's ready for even
more provisions?

13:03.408 --> 13:04.617
What's up, G?

13:04.659 --> 13:06.995
To where...
where are these going?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.371
Laundry.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.541
Oh, can you bring
that downstairs, please?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.335
-This goes downstairs?
-Everything.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.086
Well, you need to be outside so
you can tell us where things go.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.005
I don't wanna.

13:17.047 --> 13:20.342
Yo, stop it, I'm the boss of
the way food gets put away.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.385
You need to be outside so
we know where it's going.

13:22.427 --> 13:26.014
You're so argumentative
about nothing.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.017
Before I joined the boat,
I started this list...

13:29.059 --> 13:30.393
things that bothered me.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.646
Like, Mathew is gonna be
at the top of the list.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.316
There you go.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.951
Coming up...

13:46.993 --> 13:48.578
-You're gonna be on mids.
-Oh, cool.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.663
Because I want you
to do more service.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.208
It's cool to give
Courtney experience,

13:59.297 --> 13:59.881
I'm gonna strangle Mat.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.344
-Gross hot dogs.
-The sky lounge, just the floor.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.512
Yeah.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.971
And then
just fingerprint the boat.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.101
Whoa, did you just step
on the hose?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.435
Ah.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
It's looking good.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.484
Go get some food, change.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.444
Hi, things are looking good.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.029
-You good?
-Yeah.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.703
"Too late," he said.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.207
"I like you just
the way you are."

14:36.334 --> 14:38.169
All crew, all crew,
please get into your whites

14:38.211 --> 14:40.630
and let's meet on
the dock in 30 minutes.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.428
Everyone's looking sharp.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.512
-Thanks.
-Nice.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.222
Okay, so, shifts.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.682
-Same again?
-You're gonna be on mids.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.725
Oh, cool.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.728
Okay, amazing.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.187
Lexi, I'll have you on lunch,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.731
and then for the rest
of the trip

14:57.772 --> 14:59.607
I will have you as early girl,
and I'll do lates.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.775
Okay.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.444
I don't mind breakfast at all,

15:02.485 --> 15:05.572
and it's cool to give
Courtney experience.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.408
But, like, third stew
generally is laundry bitch.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.617
We'll keep turning laundry,

15:09.659 --> 15:11.119
but I think we'll
just prioritize

15:11.161 --> 15:12.120
that today so that's,
like, done.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.122
All right, we can...

15:14.164 --> 15:16.207
So, we'll do the same
thing as last time.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.043
I'm gonna do the tour,
you guys do the drinks and that.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.127
Yeah.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.420
Here they come.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.796
-Aw!
-So cute.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.381
Little gremlins.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.050
You go ahead here, Roy-Roy.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.385
Hi! Oh!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.012
So good to see you.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.140
Hello, great to see you again.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.641
-I'm Katie.
-Hey, Katie, I'm Roy.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.644
-Hi, Lexi.
-Hi, Roy, nice to see you again.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.645
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome aboard.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.230
-Oh!
-Hi.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.817
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you guys.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.320
Welcome back,
I'm so happy to have you.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.113
Our chief stewardess
is gonna take you on board

15:47.155 --> 15:48.365
-and show you around.
-Great, great.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.366
And then we're gonna
get underway

15:49.407 --> 15:50.367
to your first anchorage.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.409
Come on, Roy-Roy.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.661
Would you like a
glass of champagne?

15:53.703 --> 15:54.662
Or non-alcoholic?

15:54.704 --> 15:56.164
Yes, can I have this one?

15:56.206 --> 15:57.165
-Right, that's for you.
-Thank you.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.501
All right...
holy hell.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.378
We can top you off if you like.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.838
-Yes!
-Ugh, holy sh--.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.048
Follow me, guys.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.510
So, this is our sundeck.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.512
We have a
very big Jacuzzi up here.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.513
Whoa!

16:11.554 --> 16:12.722
Oh, this is great!

16:12.764 --> 16:14.557
And this is our sundeck aft,

16:14.599 --> 16:16.810
so this is a cool
little loungey area too.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.770
Sweet, I think that's it.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.148
So, this is our twin cabin.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.234
This might be your bed.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.735
You have to look out
the window to tell us

16:25.777 --> 16:27.570
there's no sharks or anything.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.367
I think they're cute.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.828
So, this is our primary cabin.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.830
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah!

16:36.871 --> 16:38.373
Oh, yeah!

16:38.415 --> 16:39.749
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

16:39.791 --> 16:41.584
We can start bringing
the passerelle in now.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.714
This is where Captain Sandy
will be driving the boat from.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.132
Look at this!

16:49.259 --> 16:50.719
We're gonna press that.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.886
[fog horn]

16:51.928 --> 16:54.723
-Ah!
-Oh!

16:54.764 --> 16:55.890
That was so good.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.517
Get ready on that one,

16:57.559 --> 16:58.560
but you're not gonna
take it off just yet.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.438
Oh, I'll bring it up for you.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.900
Okay, we're removing
the starboard bow.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.569
Starboard bow clear.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.571
-We good?
-Yeah, can I release this?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.573
No, no, definitely not, no.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.242
-How's our port bow looking?
-Port bow clear.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.535
Okay, Malia, you
can start freeing up

17:15.577 --> 17:16.578
your lines back there.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.579
Copy.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.873
All right, now, that one.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.708
I do feel like a
bit of a burden,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.668
because everybody else has so
much more experience than I do.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.295
And, like, if I don't ask,

17:25.337 --> 17:26.838
I'm never gonna get to
where I need to be,

17:26.880 --> 17:29.424
and I think Malia's
very understanding of that.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.634
That's all lines on,
all lines on.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.721
-Guys, we're moving!
-We're moving, we're moving!

17:34.763 --> 17:37.766
All clear off your stern,
clear to swing, clear to swing.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.601
I'm all set,
thank you very much.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.602
There you go.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.770
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.524
-Yay!
-Do you wanna wear this?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.526
All right, will you always
wear that when you're on deck?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.320
Yeah.
-Okay, high five.

17:50.362 --> 17:52.155
Every time you go outside,
Roy, you wear it, okay?

17:52.197 --> 17:54.407
Oh, no, that one's gonna
stay down in the double cabin.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.658
Okay.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.701
I'm just gonna
take this to him.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.331
One, two,
three, four, five...

18:01.373 --> 18:02.957
I'm setting up lunch now,
the table.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.502
-That's what I'm doing now.
-Whatever.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.795
What is that boat,
that is a...

18:06.836 --> 18:09.297
Tinker Bell and
Peter Pan, save us!

18:09.339 --> 18:10.840
Tinker Bell and Peter Pan?

18:10.882 --> 18:14.260
If I was a crib,
how would I be put up?

18:15.345 --> 18:16.554
[bleep].

18:20.642 --> 18:22.268
I've been a nanny,
like, a few times.

18:22.310 --> 18:25.563
I should be able
to handle it, but eh...

18:25.605 --> 18:26.731
Help me!

18:28.525 --> 18:30.819
All crew, is anybody
available to help me

18:30.860 --> 18:33.321
with this crib in
the lower guest, please?

18:33.363 --> 18:34.364
<i>Yeah, I'll come</i>
<i>down now, Court.</i>

18:34.406 --> 18:35.699
<i>Coming through now.</i>

18:35.740 --> 18:37.826
Can I get you something
else to drink, sir?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.202
Yes, I'll have more of this.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.665
Do you mind if I
stand up here while...

18:43.707 --> 18:44.666
I don't mind.
You can be the lookout.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.418
I love learning on the job.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.587
Very determined, and I've taken
that throughout my life.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.007
I used to be sponsored to play
tennis when I was younger.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.343
Playing every single day,
having no weekends, no evenings.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.262
Played in training
courts at Wimbledon,

18:57.303 --> 19:00.265
and then decided
to give it all up.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.559
I just wanted to be
a kid for a bit.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.560
Nah.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.020
Yeah, it's done.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.814
Just stand on the bottom
to keep it on the floor...

19:07.856 --> 19:08.815
there it is.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.442
We have crib.

19:17.032 --> 19:18.491
Yeah, I'm boat-happy.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.701
And the boat's
wobbling a little.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.494
-Yeah.
-I'm feeling it already.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.413
Whenever you guys are ready,
we can start with lunch, but...

19:23.455 --> 19:24.873
-All right!
-No rush, no rush,

19:24.914 --> 19:26.416
-Just whenever you're ready.
-All right.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.711
We're at
26 meters here,

19:29.753 --> 19:31.963
so you're gonna go down
to four shackles.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.256
<i>Four shackles, copy.</i>

19:33.298 --> 19:34.758
Go ahead, drop it.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.389
I'm really excited
about this charter.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.351
I can make up for
my rocky start,

19:44.392 --> 19:48.021
and also their style of
eating is my style of cooking.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.731
They like healthy,
they like light,

19:49.773 --> 19:51.358
and they've got kids on board.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.944
They're just fun energy.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.989
<i>Four shackles at the waterline.</i>

19:58.031 --> 19:59.449
We're good, Lloyd, thank you.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.743
This is what?

20:01.785 --> 20:03.787
Bibb lettuce salad
with pomegranate balsamic.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.330
Okay.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.583
We have carbonara pasta for you.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.377
-Oh!
-Wow-ow-ow-ow.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.045
Roy, here's a little
yummy-yummy spaghetti.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.089
We've got a Bibb
lettuce salad

20:14.130 --> 20:16.633
with pomegranate and
balsamic vinaigrette.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.760
I love kids.
I definitely want kids.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.387
Like, for me,
having a child

20:20.428 --> 20:22.013
is way more important
than marriage.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.932
Like, I ----ing love kids,

20:23.973 --> 20:26.685
just not on a yacht when I'm
the one that has to clean up.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.937
We've got marinated
grilled chicken.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.732
-I mean, yeah.
-Wow, thank you.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.067
All right, let's do this.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.069
Make this platform look Gucci.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.406
-All right, ready?
-Release the beast.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.782
Mm-hmm.

20:40.824 --> 20:41.991
Mat really rolled out
the carpet today.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.868
-He did.
-So good, you did really good.

20:45.829 --> 20:46.955
I'll go get changed, and
then I'll swap out with you.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.081
-Okay.
-You good for a minute?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.624
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Cool.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.966
Yeah, do this bad boy.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.135
One, two...
oof!

21:00.176 --> 21:03.054
-How's lunch?
-Lunch was amazing.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.347
Great, everything
has been amazing so far.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.557
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.558
-Yeah.
-Good. See you later.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.685
-Bye-bye.
-Mwah!

21:08.727 --> 21:10.437
I think Mathew has
got his head around it.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.813
I think the first charter,

21:11.855 --> 21:12.897
he needed to find
his feet in the galley.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.399
He needed...

21:14.441 --> 21:16.943
I don't know,
but whatever Mathew did,

21:16.985 --> 21:18.903
I'm happy Mathew
is where he is.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.158
The kids loved it.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.576
Yeah?

21:24.617 --> 21:25.577
Oh, my God,
they love their food.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.120
Awesome.

21:27.162 --> 21:28.163
It's always good when
the first meal goes well.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.873
-It just...
-Yeah.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.541
Gives you that confidence
you need to keep it going.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.503
I'm on my game today.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.380
I'm riding high on knowing
everyone loves my food.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.174
I am just in a great mood.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.094
Nothing can go wrong, and it's
going to be the best day ever.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.056
* I'm not cryin'
'cause you left me *

21:46.097 --> 21:49.642
* I've just been cuttin'
onions, makin' a lasagna *

21:49.684 --> 21:51.144
Holy sh--!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:57.817 --> 21:58.818
* I'm not cryin'
'cause you left me *

22:01.613 --> 22:04.032
* I've just been cuttin'
onions, makin' a lasagna *

22:05.033 --> 22:05.992
Holy sh--!

22:06.034 --> 22:06.993
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.244
[bleep], [bleep].

22:08.286 --> 22:09.746
Phew.

22:18.088 --> 22:21.591
The dial goes to zero,
but nine is next to it.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.259
I thought I flipped it to zero,

22:23.301 --> 22:25.804
and I flipped it to nine, and I
had grape seed oil in the pan.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.139
Whew, that was
a close one there, boys.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.766
It could have been way worse.

22:29.808 --> 22:30.934
I just react, you know?

22:30.975 --> 22:33.603
Internally panic after.

22:33.645 --> 22:36.940
* I'm not cryin'
'cause you left me *

22:36.981 --> 22:39.526
I've been with a beer
in my hand every second.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.860
Can I get you any
drinks or anything?

22:40.902 --> 22:42.112
Can I think
have a Stella, please?

22:42.153 --> 22:43.113
-A Stella?
-Can I have a Moscow Mule?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.531
Yep.

22:44.572 --> 22:45.740
-Anything for you ladies?
-Nice.

22:45.782 --> 22:46.783
You're all good?
Perfect.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.702
Thanks so much.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.079
It's so nice that Katie's
obviously, like, let me do this.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.997
The thing I'm most worried
about is just, like,

22:53.039 --> 22:54.749
tripping or falling
with the plates or,

22:54.791 --> 22:56.584
like, something
landing on someone.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.586
But I worked in a café
when I was, like, 16,

22:58.628 --> 23:00.755
and I poured boiling hot water
out of a teapot

23:00.797 --> 23:04.134
onto a customer's lap.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.719
Mm-hmm, yeah,
it was really bad.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.887
The guy did not
think it was funny.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.222
Thank you, thank you.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.141
And could I just please
have some boiled water?

23:11.182 --> 23:12.726
Yeah, of course.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.025
Courtney, Courtney, you can go
on break now, thank you.

23:22.027 --> 23:23.194
That was smart.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.863
Copy.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.031
How you doing? You got
a second, we could talk...

23:26.072 --> 23:27.532
Yeah, I can do that.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.200
All right, you wanna
go on the bridge?

23:29.242 --> 23:30.535
Okay, well, we gotta
try to do...

23:30.577 --> 23:32.162
-The slide.
-Yeah.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.581
I need to double-check what time
those musicians are coming.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.249
Between 6:00 and 7:00.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.668
Sweet, I'll pull those tables
out, have a look at them.

23:38.710 --> 23:39.711
Cool.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.046
I have to dock,

23:43.882 --> 23:44.841
-Okay.
-Yeah.

23:44.883 --> 23:46.718
Thank you.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.802
And we won't be making the dock
if we don't make the dock.

23:47.844 --> 23:48.887
Yeah, okay.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.263
Look at this, oh, God.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.681
We're not doing it
right now, are we?

23:51.723 --> 23:52.682
There's no time
like the present.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.184
Woo, ha ha ha!

23:54.225 --> 23:55.310
-Oh, Lord.
-He got stuck there!

23:55.352 --> 23:57.812
Oh, my God!

23:57.854 --> 24:00.648
Okay, Bo, now you got
a lifejacket and a helmet.

24:00.690 --> 24:01.775
Yeah.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.318
Now, run free.

24:04.778 --> 24:05.820
Ah!

24:08.323 --> 24:09.282
I'm gonna go in!

24:09.324 --> 24:10.784
-Kissy!
-Mwah!

24:10.825 --> 24:12.035
-Oh!
-Go in!

24:12.077 --> 24:13.244
Wait, I gotta see
if Mommy's here.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.881
and then you see him,
he's like, doo-doo, bee-doo.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.049
Like this, the whole time.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.092
Right, he, like,
punches the air,

24:27.133 --> 24:28.843
and he's, like...

24:31.680 --> 24:33.223
Bridge, bridge,
that's two jet skis away

24:33.264 --> 24:34.891
with two adults, two children.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.184
Thank you.

24:40.105 --> 24:42.732
I'm so happy that
the guests are happy.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.859
It's always good when
the first meal goes well.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.070
It's a good start to a trip.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.655
I mean, you're the boss
of the galley.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.782
You need to be outside
so you can--

24:50.824 --> 24:53.702
Stop it, I'm the boss of
the way food gets put away.

24:53.743 --> 24:54.953
Mm.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.707
Look at that, like a pro.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.708
Come here...

24:59.749 --> 25:01.001
Oh!

25:01.042 --> 25:02.002
Did you have
an awesome time out there?

25:02.043 --> 25:03.837
-I like it.
-Yeah?

25:03.878 --> 25:05.839
What is it now,
Rebekah and Christina?

25:08.216 --> 25:10.760
I would not give
the nanny to the sharks.

25:10.802 --> 25:12.679
-You wanna watch Mom go?
-Yeah.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.097
Okay.

25:14.139 --> 25:16.266
I guess I can watch your child.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.312
Okay.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.108
Yo, Lloyd, you wanna
help me bring crew lunch down?

25:25.150 --> 25:26.359
Of course.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.657
And does anyone know
what type of soup it is?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.409
-Tom Yung.
-Oh, yes!

25:34.451 --> 25:36.411
I know, vibe, right?

25:36.453 --> 25:37.412
-It's good.
-Oh, my God.

25:37.454 --> 25:38.830
Is it okay?

25:38.872 --> 25:40.790
Your food for
the crew is beyond.

25:40.832 --> 25:43.251
Ah, thank you.
You guys are too kind.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.045
I'm so happy your knee's okay.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.087
I know, me too.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.797
And Mommy's back!

25:47.839 --> 25:49.132
Mommy's a crazy driver.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.342
That was so fun.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.801
Mommy Asa was
going full-throttle.

25:51.843 --> 25:52.969
-Oh!
-Are you going out?

25:53.011 --> 25:54.971
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank you.

25:55.013 --> 25:58.141
We are going into port later
because it's gonna pick up wind.

25:58.183 --> 26:01.311
The musicians will be
coming between 6:00 and 7:00.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.188
And can the kids eat at 6:00?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.314
Perfect.

26:04.356 --> 26:05.857
Okay, let's do the slide.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.028
It's a conscious choice, guys.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.738
I'm going ahead of you now.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.198
I'm obviously the farthest
along at the moment.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.033
-Yeah.
-But I'm trying to do that.

26:15.075 --> 26:17.035
I've got comfortable
with the boat and the people,

26:17.077 --> 26:18.370
and you guys are great.

26:18.411 --> 26:19.788
Jesus.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.831
Oh, my gosh.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.708
Can I get you anything else?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.001
-Step it up!
-I'll do a Moscow Mule.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.169
-Moscow Mule?
-Yeah, a Moscow Mule.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.337
-Yeah, thank you.
-On the way.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.130
-Can I have a Moscow Mule?
-Yes.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.049
For tonight, we're gonna
have some musical guests

26:31.091 --> 26:32.967
between 6:00 and 7:00,

26:33.009 --> 26:35.970
and then after that we're gonna
be heading into port tonight,

26:36.012 --> 26:37.180
so we will have
a nighttime docking.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.348
Oh...

26:38.390 --> 26:40.725
So, what time is
the actual dinner, 9:00?

26:40.767 --> 26:43.311
Nine, the performers
will be ready by 6:30.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.188
They're not actually
performing on the boat.

26:45.230 --> 26:48.149
I could set that up, just
gimme the table and everything.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.734
Yeah, deck crew has the table.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.237
Just throw, like,
a tablecloth on it, and...

26:52.278 --> 26:55.073
Some flowers?
Minibar, swim platform.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.492
Cool, you do that,
and then do you wanna

26:57.534 --> 27:01.204
start in laundry so
Courtney can step off?

27:01.246 --> 27:03.498
Common sense can
really kick in here.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.083
Like, if you want to
give someone experience...

27:05.125 --> 27:06.543
I had to learn.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.795
I didn't do any courses,
someone had to show me,

27:08.837 --> 27:11.047
but they showed me not
during charter season.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.967
That's not the right time to
train someone on charter at all.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.468
Do you wanna go on a break now?

27:15.510 --> 27:16.928
Okay, yeah, I'm going.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.263
I'll see you soon.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.099
Ah, come on.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.811
Okay, now.

27:24.853 --> 27:27.105
So, the kids are gonna eat
around 6:00, right?

27:27.147 --> 27:28.231
Yeah.
Got some pizza.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.358
-Oh, my gosh!
-I love pizza!

27:30.400 --> 27:32.485
-Yeah!
-Yay!

27:32.527 --> 27:34.863
It's so fun cooking for kids.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.866
Who doesn't love pizza
and pasta and kid's food?

27:37.907 --> 27:40.952
I ordered off the kid's menu the
last time I stayed at a resort.

27:40.994 --> 27:43.079
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.373
It's fun, but it's difficult
to coordinate from crew diner

27:45.415 --> 27:47.459
to guest dinner
that's multi-course.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.836
I find that I thrive
under pressure.

27:49.878 --> 27:51.504
It's when I have
too much time to think

27:51.546 --> 27:53.381
about things that I struggle.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.970
-There you are.
-Did you find me on Insta?

27:59.012 --> 28:00.055
Likes SCUBA diving.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.223
Yeah, that's me.

28:02.265 --> 28:05.185
"Likes SCUBA diving"

28:05.226 --> 28:07.562
On a previous boat,
it was a really not very nice

28:07.604 --> 28:10.190
working environment, not
supportive, and not pleasant.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.860
So, coming into this
environment is eye-opening.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.285
Cheese and 'roni, you know
what I'm saying?

28:22.327 --> 28:23.495
Cheese and pepperoni.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.332
Cheese and pepperoni.

28:27.374 --> 28:29.042
-Uh-oh!
-Uh-oh!

28:29.084 --> 28:30.293
Oh, my gosh, is it
yummy-yummy delicious pizza?

28:30.335 --> 28:33.129
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

28:33.171 --> 28:34.506
If you two wanna roll,
I'll just quickly...

28:34.547 --> 28:36.966
-Yeah.
-Back and forth for this.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.177
-Some light reading?
-Yeah, just reading.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.311
Of, like, human names on there.

28:48.353 --> 28:49.979
-Yes.
-Oh, my...

28:50.021 --> 28:52.357
Can I see it?

28:52.399 --> 28:54.317
Oh, my God.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.528
Ah... no, don't call...
don't...

28:56.569 --> 28:58.154
-Am I on there?
-No, you're not on there.

28:58.196 --> 29:01.241
Oh. "An idle mind is
a dangerous mind."

29:01.282 --> 29:03.159
I was idle.

29:03.201 --> 29:06.079
I was like, "Let's see all the
people who wronged me," like...

29:06.121 --> 29:07.455
Oh.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.461
I don't...
so these are names...

29:13.503 --> 29:15.588
It kinda makes me wanna
sleep with one eye open.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.137
That's a long burn list, girl.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.138
Yeah.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.431
The [bleep]?

29:26.141 --> 29:27.600
Do you want me to go
get changed and come back up,

29:27.642 --> 29:29.352
or do you want me to
just go back down to laundry?

29:29.394 --> 29:31.021
You can get changed, and
I'll just give you a shout.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.272
Yeah, no worries.

29:32.313 --> 29:35.150
-Quickly.
-Yeah, but not that quick.

29:35.191 --> 29:36.443
Cool, yeah.

29:38.528 --> 29:39.487
Heh.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.364
Yeah? Well, who-who?

29:41.406 --> 29:42.365
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.992
Oh, come on.

29:44.034 --> 29:45.535
I ain't gonna
tell him who I'm into.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.371
We might be competing
for the same girl.

29:48.413 --> 29:51.374
This is my information and
you can get ----ed.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.084
Very limited on options,
isn't it?

29:53.126 --> 29:54.961
Well, what did we learn
at sexual harassment training?

29:55.003 --> 29:56.629
That supervisors are...

29:56.671 --> 29:58.381
Behind you.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.008
What was that, Lloyd?

30:00.050 --> 30:02.469
We were talking
about who we like.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.511
I'm gonna do a deck check.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.221
[laughing]

30:07.390 --> 30:08.391
It's quite embarrassing.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.562
Hey, Malia, because of
social distancing,

30:12.604 --> 30:14.397
they're gonna go there,
and then you'll need

30:14.439 --> 30:16.733
to free up those cleats so you
can tie the vessel off of it.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.361
-Okay, we can do that.
-Yeah.

30:19.402 --> 30:22.280
So, the vessel will sit off our
stern and we'll have it tied up,

30:22.322 --> 30:23.406
and they can enjoy
it from down there.

30:23.448 --> 30:24.407
-Yeah.
-Cool.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.076
Social distancing concert.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.160
I know.

30:27.202 --> 30:28.244
Right after, we'll haul anchor.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.454
All right, we'll make it happen.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.955
What a nice table.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.001
Ah!

30:41.800 --> 30:45.387
All crew, all crew, I believe
the musicians have arrived.

30:47.597 --> 30:49.474
Katie, Katie, where do
you want them to stay?

30:53.728 --> 30:54.688
I don't know,
that's why I'm asking you.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.481
Yeah, they do.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.233
They just have to be on standby
until the guests are ready.

30:58.274 --> 30:59.567
So, how am I supposed to know?

30:59.609 --> 31:00.610
I don't read...

31:02.737 --> 31:04.197
Coming up...

31:04.239 --> 31:05.365
-Mm.
-Oh, my God.

31:05.407 --> 31:06.449
You see how sh---faced he is?

31:06.491 --> 31:07.617
Uh, yeah.

31:07.659 --> 31:08.993
What is it,
what is this sh--?

31:09.035 --> 31:10.453
Go to bed, now!

31:10.495 --> 31:12.997
Oh! It's only...
it's only the second--

31:16.710 --> 31:17.627
Hi, so 6:30 is when
the performance

31:20.088 --> 31:21.214
is supposed to happen.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.215
Do they understand?

31:22.257 --> 31:23.425
-Okay.
-Twenty minutes?

31:23.466 --> 31:25.218
-Okay.
-Okay, awesome, thank you.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.805
Yeah, we can just tie it.

31:28.847 --> 31:30.432
-Oh, oh.
-Yeah, okay...

31:30.473 --> 31:31.516
-Oh, that's them.
-Are we going now?

31:31.558 --> 31:32.767
Yeah, we'll go down there and...

31:32.809 --> 31:34.519
Yeah, I should
probably pee.

31:34.561 --> 31:36.146
Yeah, so go use the restroom

31:36.187 --> 31:37.397
and then we'll meet
here in five minutes.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.232
-I'm gonna go pee.
-Good, good.

31:39.274 --> 31:40.525
First we meet in here, Roy,
and just sit down here, baby.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.402
Bew, bew, bew.

31:44.696 --> 31:47.157
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-Ah!

31:47.198 --> 31:49.242
<i>Do I invite the dancers</i>
<i>onto the yacht now?</i>

31:49.284 --> 31:50.368
Someone tell me.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.203
They're not allowed on the boat,

31:52.245 --> 31:54.622
that's the whole purpose of
them being on another boat.

31:54.664 --> 31:56.791
Yeah, like, I'm not a
----ing psychic here.

31:56.833 --> 32:00.545
With Katie, managing situations
is not her strong suit.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.088
-Are you ready?
-Yeah!

32:02.130 --> 32:03.882
Shall we go?

32:03.923 --> 32:05.383
I really don't like when I
don't know what I'm doing,

32:05.425 --> 32:07.552
and these musicians
are staring at us,

32:07.594 --> 32:09.387
and I don't have any
answers to give them.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.097
So, it's an awkward stare-off.

32:11.139 --> 32:13.850
-We are on our way.
-Yeah!

32:13.892 --> 32:15.226
Hey!
I'm so confused.

32:15.268 --> 32:16.561
Do you wanna play?

32:16.603 --> 32:17.812
You can play, you can
start playing, yes.

32:17.854 --> 32:18.897
-Yes!
-Go!

32:18.938 --> 32:20.106
-You want a flag?
-Yeah.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.816
[music plays]

32:21.858 --> 32:23.818
Oh, yeah, I'd like one
of those, yeah.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.612
Mm! Oops.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.405
I'll take it,
thanks so much.

32:27.447 --> 32:30.742
It's magic of Croatia.

32:30.784 --> 32:32.285
[belches]
It's magic.

32:33.870 --> 32:35.288
I love children.

32:35.330 --> 32:38.792
Like, everything is dirty.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.752
[singing in Croatian]

32:43.463 --> 32:44.506
The best night ever.

32:46.591 --> 32:47.926
Okay.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.552
-Keep on going.
-Yay!

32:49.594 --> 32:50.720
-Woo!
-Can I get a witness?

32:50.762 --> 32:52.722
-Thank you!
-Bye!

32:52.764 --> 32:54.891
-That's amazing.
-Z, you are down, sir.

32:54.933 --> 32:57.477
-See you at 8:00.
-Copy that.

32:57.519 --> 33:00.897
Fish sauce,
get your fish sauce here.

33:00.939 --> 33:04.317
Although I've had so much
experience private cooking,

33:04.359 --> 33:06.277
I didn't have formal training

33:06.319 --> 33:08.571
and I know the clients
I'm cooking for

33:08.613 --> 33:10.532
have eaten at the best
restaurants in the world.

33:10.573 --> 33:14.369
So, I'm never confident that
it's, like, at that standard.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.788
Cheffy, how many
plates are we pulling?

33:16.830 --> 33:18.331
-I'll grab the plates.
-You'll grab them yourself?

33:18.373 --> 33:20.166
-Yeah, yeah.
-Awesome.

33:25.714 --> 33:27.424
Sorry, I'm talking to myself.

33:27.465 --> 33:30.343
Imagine there was another
you standing right there.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.803
It's so embarrassing.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.932
David always smells so good.

33:35.974 --> 33:37.517
-Evening.
-How are you?

33:38.935 --> 33:40.645
That's good.

33:40.687 --> 33:41.771
Yeah, good.

33:41.813 --> 33:43.231
How's it been on deck?

33:44.607 --> 33:45.567
Yeah?
Are you learning...

33:45.608 --> 33:46.609
Learning a lot.

33:50.655 --> 33:51.781
Really?

33:51.823 --> 33:53.450
It's been good.

33:53.491 --> 33:54.868
That's like me
with service, though.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.665
I still can't believe that
that happened.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.628
If you need a hand,
give me a shout.

34:05.670 --> 34:07.213
Will do.

34:08.381 --> 34:09.632
Yeah, I'm sure.

34:09.674 --> 34:10.633
Becca, where's your drink?

34:10.675 --> 34:12.927
Look, Lexi is in our life again.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.929
We got Lexi and
David.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.723
Becca has a crush on David.

34:18.933 --> 34:19.976
He does!
He does, right?

34:20.018 --> 34:21.603
Yes, thank you!

34:21.644 --> 34:23.980
Woo-ooh, someone's
got a crush on David.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.231
Ooh!

34:27.817 --> 34:29.027
Hey!

34:29.069 --> 34:30.737
Are you all good
for now with the drink?

34:30.779 --> 34:33.573
I have no idea, but I suppose
I need another.

34:33.615 --> 34:37.410
Can I actually have a
virgin champagne.

34:37.452 --> 34:38.703
Yeah.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.539
These two are going to bed.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.375
You're gonna be tired,
you've got a big day.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.710
Yeah, we're not gonna
last very long, any of us.

34:46.878 --> 34:49.297
Bakka-bakka-bakka.

34:49.339 --> 34:50.882
Thank you so much.

34:50.924 --> 34:51.966
You're welcome.

34:52.008 --> 34:53.760
Roy-Roy, ne, ne, ne.
[laughs]

34:53.802 --> 34:56.888
Wait, I wanna...
I'm taking Roy down with Becca.

34:56.930 --> 34:58.306
Good night.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.891
Night-night, go to bed,
everybody.

34:59.933 --> 35:00.934
Lexi, Lexi...

35:03.812 --> 35:05.814
Copy.

35:05.855 --> 35:07.691
Hi, do you wanna
come up for dinner?

35:07.732 --> 35:11.444
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you, bye.

35:11.486 --> 35:13.697
Every boat I've ever worked
on, we've always rotated.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.365
I've never been on a boat

35:15.407 --> 35:18.326
that's been a separate
interior or service.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.787
I like doing laundry
and service,

35:20.829 --> 35:22.497
I'm not big on housekeeping.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.457
So, I'm sure some girls
feel the same way.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.793
But at the end of the day,
we have a boat to run.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.586
This is part of
the interior department.

35:28.628 --> 35:31.589
If you have a problem,
don't ----ing be a yachtie.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.633
Skoll.
Here we go.

35:35.343 --> 35:36.553
Let's sit down.

35:36.594 --> 35:37.595
Yeah, we can sit down,
we can down.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.722
Ooh.

35:38.763 --> 35:40.557
Oh, it's like Asian decorations.

35:40.598 --> 35:41.766
Like a full moon party.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.768
-Yeah.
-It is nearly a full moon party.

35:43.810 --> 35:45.770
Would anyone like
wine with dinner,

35:45.812 --> 35:46.771
or you--

35:46.813 --> 35:47.856
Yeah, I can have some red wine.

35:47.897 --> 35:48.940
-Red?
-Okay, what do you want?

35:48.982 --> 35:51.026
Something, like,
more than that.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.111
Okay, a double vodka-Red Bull

35:53.153 --> 35:55.405
and a champagne,
double Fernet-Branca.

35:55.447 --> 35:57.073
Sure.

35:57.115 --> 36:00.035
And I'm probably swimming in
the ocean before we go to sleep.

36:00.076 --> 36:01.870
-Good luck.
-"Good luck?"

36:01.911 --> 36:02.871
Is dinner going out now?

36:02.912 --> 36:04.456
Yeah.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.458
Katie, do you want me on
standby in the galley?

36:06.499 --> 36:07.792
Please, I'm just making some
drinks, and then I'll be down.

36:07.834 --> 36:09.377
Copy.

36:09.419 --> 36:10.920
Courtney, you're third stew
hon, sorry.

36:10.962 --> 36:13.089
Have to work your
way up the ladder.

36:13.131 --> 36:14.966
I've been in this industry
for three years,

36:15.008 --> 36:17.469
and I'm glad Courtney's
learning to do other things.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.470
I'm not gonna lie...

36:18.511 --> 36:19.929
like, some girls are like,

36:19.971 --> 36:21.348
yeah, I just wanna, like,
make your bed all day.

36:21.389 --> 36:22.349
It's bullsh--.

36:22.390 --> 36:23.808
No, that's just not me.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.018
Ah ha!

36:30.899 --> 36:33.026
I'm not even trying to be silly.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.486
I'm gonna be swimming
before I go to bed.

36:34.527 --> 36:35.987
Ah!

36:36.029 --> 36:38.698
<i>Galley, galley,</i>
<i>I'll be about two minutes.</i>

36:38.740 --> 36:40.658
All right, hurry up and wait.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.911
I mean, I can order three
or four of those, too.

36:42.952 --> 36:45.163
It's a party night.

36:45.205 --> 36:48.416
But hey, drink the
non-alcoholic stuff, it's great.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.420
Okay.

36:52.462 --> 36:53.630
Okay, that was wonderful.

36:55.548 --> 36:58.093
Sorry, he just ordered
four different drinks off me

36:58.134 --> 36:59.427
-before dinner service.
-No worries.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.470
Cool.

37:01.846 --> 37:03.640
When I first started
in yachting,

37:03.682 --> 37:06.851
I had only really had, like,
basic service training before.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.561
The other side of it
was actually really scary

37:08.603 --> 37:11.022
for me, because laundry
can be so overwhelming.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.607
And when you're green and
you've got no idea

37:12.649 --> 37:14.067
what you're ----ing doing,
holy sh--,

37:14.109 --> 37:16.111
it can turn into a
sh---show real quick.

37:17.987 --> 37:19.447
Yeah.

37:19.489 --> 37:20.448
My chief stew was amazing
at the time,

37:20.490 --> 37:21.700
and she left me in the deep end,

37:21.741 --> 37:23.201
which I think is
the best way to learn.

37:23.243 --> 37:24.703
It sets, like, the foundation
for every other boat

37:24.744 --> 37:25.787
you're gonna be on afterwards.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.497
I'm so over this.

37:27.539 --> 37:28.915
Are you saying that
we can't go in the water?

37:28.957 --> 37:32.043
You have chicken satay
with a papaya salad.

37:32.085 --> 37:33.670
Chicken satay.

37:33.712 --> 37:35.088
It's so good,
I dig in right away.

37:35.130 --> 37:37.757
-I can barely put it down.
-So good.

37:44.764 --> 37:45.890
I want more of this chicken.

37:45.932 --> 37:46.891
So good.

37:46.933 --> 37:48.810
Mm!

37:48.852 --> 37:49.853
Whoa!

37:55.150 --> 37:59.446
I'm gonna jump of the second
floor balcony for fun.

37:59.487 --> 38:03.033
I thought they're not
big drinkers, it's a family.

38:03.074 --> 38:04.492
Boy, was I wrong.

38:04.534 --> 38:07.996
A happy time.
Happy times!

38:09.706 --> 38:11.458
Oh, my God.

38:11.499 --> 38:13.126
Yeah, I love you, mwah, mwah.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.137
This is so good.

38:25.764 --> 38:27.182
Mm!

38:27.223 --> 38:28.266
Whoa.

38:28.308 --> 38:29.851
Mm. Mm.

38:31.603 --> 38:32.604
Uh, yeah.

38:33.855 --> 38:35.690
Mm!

38:37.650 --> 38:40.153
I'm gonna jump off
the second floor balcony.

38:40.195 --> 38:41.696
What's up, Z?

38:45.784 --> 38:47.827
Just to get it wrong.
I don't know why.

38:47.869 --> 38:49.662
You're gonna be fine.

38:49.704 --> 38:50.830
Oh, my God.

38:50.872 --> 38:52.165
Yeah, I love you, mwah, mwah.

38:54.209 --> 38:55.752
Katie, Katie, Court.

38:55.794 --> 38:57.253
I think we're ready to clear.

38:57.295 --> 38:58.296
Okay.

38:58.338 --> 38:59.798
Well, her glasses just broke.

38:59.839 --> 39:01.966
I hope she knows
that she did that.

39:02.008 --> 39:04.552
* We're here in the galley and
we're chillin' with Daddy *

39:04.594 --> 39:06.930
* We got a lot goin' on,
but we're feelin' so swaggy *

39:06.971 --> 39:09.599
* We're eating lots of food,
but we ain't gettin' merry *

39:09.641 --> 39:12.769
Courtney's on service tonight,
which is a refreshing change.

39:12.811 --> 39:15.980
* Now we're gettin' fat,
and we don't give a Larry *

39:16.022 --> 39:17.607
Yeah.

39:17.649 --> 39:20.151
I ----ing love Courtney,
she brings the best vibes.

39:20.193 --> 39:22.112
She's a little ditzy,
but she's hilarious.

39:23.321 --> 39:24.698
Malia, Malia, Sandy.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.032
Hauling the anchor,
five minutes.

39:26.074 --> 39:27.909
Copy.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.703
All right, let's pick up anchor,
then we're heading in.

39:29.744 --> 39:30.995
Is everyone prepped, ready?

39:31.037 --> 39:32.372
-Yeah.
-I'm going to the bathroom.

39:32.414 --> 39:33.707
Yeah, do that.

39:33.748 --> 39:34.874
Ugh!

39:34.916 --> 39:36.584
-It's just annoying.
-Yeah.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.587
As soon as we get
to the break...

39:39.629 --> 39:41.256
-Yeah.
-We can throw fenders.

39:41.297 --> 39:42.257
[drunken slurring]

39:42.298 --> 39:43.633
Yeah, I have to go--

39:46.094 --> 39:47.929
-Yeah.
-Honest to God.

39:47.971 --> 39:50.181
One handed.

39:50.223 --> 39:53.852
Mm, mm, mm,
hey, hi, hi, darling.

39:53.893 --> 39:54.894
Hello.

39:58.064 --> 39:59.107
Okay.

40:00.942 --> 40:02.402
Okay.
Thank you for letting us know.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.991
I can do it.
I'll do it.

40:11.953 --> 40:14.748
Hm, poor Courtney, she's
on service for a hot minute,

40:14.789 --> 40:16.875
and now she's back
to the day hits.

40:20.211 --> 40:22.964
Ah, when was the last time you
were tickled by a grown man?

40:23.006 --> 40:25.759
All right, let's get
prepped on the anchors.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.761
Coming in at night
is always tricky,

40:27.802 --> 40:29.429
because visibility is limited.

40:29.471 --> 40:31.097
Start hauling the anchor.

40:31.139 --> 40:33.725
<i>Got more wind coming.</i>

40:33.767 --> 40:35.352
Blue on deck.

40:35.393 --> 40:37.937
Your confidence builds each
time you go through a docking.

40:37.979 --> 40:40.940
Well, after it goes
successfully, I guess.

40:40.982 --> 40:43.109
<i>-Anchor home.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

40:43.151 --> 40:46.196
Woo! We're getting the...

40:46.237 --> 40:47.280
Okay.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.782
Get in the pool again.

40:48.823 --> 40:50.909
We're having a fun time.

40:52.369 --> 40:54.746
----ing current's wicked.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.373
<i>Captain Sandy,</i>
<i>you've got Lloyd on the bow.</i>

40:56.414 --> 40:57.665
All right, Lloyd,
keep a lookout.

40:57.707 --> 40:58.750
<i>Copy, Captain.</i>

40:58.792 --> 41:00.210
So it should be
this line first.

41:00.251 --> 41:02.420
I'm switching to
the port wing station.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.964
Port dolphin is lined up
35 feet and closing.

41:05.006 --> 41:06.758
Just line me up in the hole.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.301
Copy.

41:09.302 --> 41:10.762
----ing woomp!

41:16.434 --> 41:17.936
Do you have eyes on
the starboard dolphin?

41:17.977 --> 41:19.145
I do, thank you.

41:19.187 --> 41:21.356
Can we actually
come... which way?

41:22.357 --> 41:23.775
Okay.

41:23.817 --> 41:24.901
So, if ever in doubt,
meat at six.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.820
Drink some more water, Roy.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.405
Oh, God, the food is coming.

41:28.446 --> 41:31.116
Hey, baby, here's the food!

41:31.157 --> 41:34.327
We have duck on a bed
of rice noodles...

41:34.369 --> 41:36.121
What if I don't
embarrass myself?

41:36.162 --> 41:38.248
What if I just eat this food
and go to bed?

41:38.289 --> 41:41.960
Sweet potato, and topped
with a tamarind sauce.

41:44.045 --> 41:45.338
Oh, my God, it's like Christmas!

41:45.380 --> 41:47.173
Hey, can...
can I have a...

41:47.215 --> 41:50.802
can I have another champagne
and another Fernet-Branca?

41:52.303 --> 41:53.346
Is it...

41:53.388 --> 41:55.140
I'm going with what she says.

41:55.181 --> 41:57.892
Just gonna pretend I didn't
hear that drink order.

41:57.934 --> 41:59.978
Correct choice.
That is the correct choice.

42:03.398 --> 42:05.191
Yeah, I'm--

42:05.233 --> 42:07.444
So, I just jump off the boat
over in that corner?

42:07.485 --> 42:08.862
That'd be great.

42:08.903 --> 42:11.740
Option two.
Slight bump to port.

42:11.781 --> 42:13.241
Okay, guys, are we ready
on our heaving lines?

42:13.283 --> 42:14.909
Yeah.

42:14.951 --> 42:16.911
It's our second time
coming into the berth,

42:16.953 --> 42:19.914
relatively new crew
working together.

42:19.956 --> 42:21.916
Z's second time
actually on the aft,

42:21.958 --> 42:23.543
throwing that heaving line,

42:23.585 --> 42:27.130
and he needs to make this throw,
you know, shrouded by darkness,

42:27.172 --> 42:28.840
which puts added
pressure on everyone.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.300
Thirty feet, closing.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.843
This is what the women want.

42:31.885 --> 42:33.345
So, okay.

42:33.386 --> 42:35.388
-No, no, no.
-Stop it.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.808
We're on the second choice...
oh!

42:38.850 --> 42:41.019
-No, no!
-Sending stern lines across.

42:41.061 --> 42:43.104
Slight kick to port.

42:43.146 --> 42:44.397
I don't like this.

42:44.439 --> 42:45.857
Oh, it's only...
it's only...

42:45.899 --> 42:47.317
it's only the second...

42:47.359 --> 42:49.110
Roy, Roy, Roy,
that's not an option anymore.

42:49.152 --> 42:50.487
Please, please, I mean,
why is this a problem?

42:50.528 --> 42:51.780
What's happening?

42:51.821 --> 42:53.239
-No, no!
-They... it isn't.

42:53.281 --> 42:55.241
Go to bed, now.
I'm serious... go to bed now.

42:55.283 --> 42:56.284
Here.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.786
Hey, Malia!

42:57.827 --> 42:58.995
Keep the line out of
the water, please.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.413
Go to bed, now.

43:00.455 --> 43:01.915
So, are you saying
I should jump over there?

43:01.956 --> 43:03.333
-Hold on...
-Pull that line, pull that line.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.334
I'm going in the water.

43:04.376 --> 43:05.335
What the [bleep]?

43:05.377 --> 43:07.003
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.463
-No, Z!
-Oh, my...

43:09.506 --> 43:10.965
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:11.007 --> 43:12.592
Thank you, Daddy.

43:12.634 --> 43:14.886
-Oh, my... oh!
-Oh, my...

43:14.928 --> 43:17.180
Ah!

43:17.222 --> 43:19.099
I did not think he had
that in him.

43:19.140 --> 43:20.433
I'm impressed.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.352
Woo!

43:22.394 --> 43:23.436
We have three guests
that are up.

43:23.478 --> 43:24.938
They wanna eat now.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.606
I gotta wait for Katie.
Can you get Katie?

43:26.648 --> 43:29.109
Katie is asleep.
I am the breakfast girl.

43:29.150 --> 43:31.236
So, I can't get Katie.

43:32.904 --> 43:33.988
No.

43:34.030 --> 43:35.115
Yeah, you have to.

43:35.156 --> 43:36.116
----ing bullsh--.

43:36.157 --> 43:37.951
No days off, no hours of rest.

43:37.992 --> 43:39.244
That is part of your job.

43:39.285 --> 43:40.620
No.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.247
Hey! Woo!

43:44.207 --> 43:46.292
I haven't even jerked
off in, like, a month.

43:46.334 --> 43:48.044
Mat, shut the [bleep] up!

43:48.086 --> 43:50.130
Find some asshole to be
your chef, I'm going home.

43:50.171 --> 43:52.173
I'm packing, I wanna
get on a plane.

43:52.215 --> 43:55.468
Good luck, you'll have
some ----ing asshole chef.

43:55.510 --> 43:56.553
-I'm done, I'm done.
-Hey, buddy...

43:56.594 --> 43:58.054
Get off my ----ing face.

44:00.265 --> 44:02.350
Let's just be ----ing deckhands!

44:02.392 --> 44:04.978
Ah, you ----ing deckhand!

44:05.020 --> 44:07.897
You're a ----ing bosun.
Stand the [bleep] down.

44:07.939 --> 44:09.315
I'm done being nice.

44:09.357 --> 44:11.109
You messed up your sh--.

44:11.151 --> 44:13.028
No, you're being
a kiss-ass [bleep] off.

44:13.069 --> 44:14.487
-Hey, oh, oh, oh!
-Lexi!
