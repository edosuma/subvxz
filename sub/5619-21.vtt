00:01.920 --> 00:04.297
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.422 --> 00:07.258
I got another glimpse into the future.

00:07.926 --> 00:09.511
<i>I don't know when,</i>

00:09.594 --> 00:11.596
<i>but someone on our team is gonna die.</i>

00:11.721 --> 00:13.973
Keep the faith, Alphonso Mackenzie.

00:16.393 --> 00:17.644
Your friends are very persistent.

00:17.769 --> 00:18.853
They keep finding us.

00:18.937 --> 00:20.647
If it happens again,

00:20.772 --> 00:22.315
there'll be no absolution.

00:22.440 --> 00:26.069
Every Inhuman is here for a reason
and serves a purpose.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.031
Now, you're free.

00:30.115 --> 00:31.408
Ragtag base,

00:31.491 --> 00:33.326
I'm coming home.

00:33.451 --> 00:37.247
Hive could create an all-in-one virus
that instantly transforms any humans

00:37.330 --> 00:40.542
into swayed Inhumans,
completely under his control.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.253
If he finds a way to disperse it
high enough in the atmosphere.

00:43.336 --> 00:44.838
He could potentially infect

00:44.963 --> 00:47.340
a significant percentage
of the human race.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.550
He has a way.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.844
<i>He stole a fully operational warhead.</i>

01:16.828 --> 01:19.956
How long do you think
we can survive in here?

01:21.791 --> 01:23.793
We're the last ones.

01:26.296 --> 01:29.883
You always find a way
to survive, don't you?

01:30.008 --> 01:31.718
It's in our blood.

01:37.891 --> 01:40.185
I knew someone was gonna go.

01:40.852 --> 01:42.896
I just didn't know everyone would.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.406
Once I connect the wires,

01:54.157 --> 01:58.745
I can hack the controls on the module
and finally pilot us back to Earth.

01:59.829 --> 02:00.872
Daisy,

02:02.373 --> 02:03.583
this is Earth.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.706
The kill switches to our vests,
if it comes to it.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.427
How we holding up?

02:58.429 --> 02:59.889
Not sure.

02:59.973 --> 03:02.475
It wasn't designed for this.

03:14.946 --> 03:17.115
I've told you everything I know.

03:17.657 --> 03:20.493
I'm here to provide progress updates
based on the intel you gave us.

03:20.618 --> 03:21.661
Nothing more.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.414
And they only send you.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.623
Why?

03:25.748 --> 03:27.917
If anything I tell you jogs any memories,

03:28.001 --> 03:30.962
any pertinent information at all,
I'll ask you to divulge.

03:33.673 --> 03:36.134
It's because you're the only one
I didn't hurt.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.095
Personally, I mean.

03:40.430 --> 03:41.806
That's why.

03:44.809 --> 03:47.103
Have you thought of any new
pertinent information?

03:49.814 --> 03:52.358
As I said, Hive's followers
tell him everything,

03:52.483 --> 03:54.360
but he rarely returns the favour.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.739
I'm sorry that's not enough to act on.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.324
Well, we are acting on a new lead.

04:00.033 --> 04:03.077
We've located a U.S. missile silo
in the Pacific.

04:03.161 --> 04:04.621
Seems like a good fit.

04:04.704 --> 04:06.956
If that's where they plan to do it,
they'll be there ahead of you.

04:07.832 --> 04:08.833
Yes.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.336
<i>The silo's staff went silent
five hours ago.</i>

04:14.672 --> 04:17.800
Sir, the warhead is in place,
and the missile is armed.

04:17.884 --> 04:20.219
The man who starts
the launch sequence,

04:20.345 --> 04:21.762
is he willing to cooperate?

04:21.846 --> 04:24.807
Yep. Turned out to be
a real team player.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.225
What about S.H.I.E.L.D.?

04:26.476 --> 04:28.853
I've warned you about cloaking.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.980
And we've calibrated for it.

04:31.064 --> 04:34.734
If they fly anywhere near this island,
we'll see it.

04:35.652 --> 04:36.819
Very good.

05:00.593 --> 05:03.054
We're looking for the freight dock
on the north side.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.723
<i>Even if you infiltrate,
you can't shut down the launch,</i>

05:05.848 --> 05:06.975
not without government kill codes.

05:07.058 --> 05:09.310
- We are aware.
- Hand-delivered by a DoD official.

05:09.394 --> 05:10.478
It's not hackable. You won't be...

05:10.561 --> 05:11.604
We are aware.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.567
<i>I'm sorry. The answer is no.</i>

05:16.693 --> 05:18.861
I'm asking you for one
missile launch kill code, General.

05:18.945 --> 05:20.363
<i>Violating chain of command.</i>

05:20.446 --> 05:21.489
Chain of command...

05:21.572 --> 05:22.991
Chain of command's
gonna take two weeks.

05:23.074 --> 05:25.410
<i>You like to cut red tape. I get it.</i>

05:25.785 --> 05:27.704
<i>But procedures are in place
for a reason.</i>

05:27.787 --> 05:28.955
<i>You'd say the same thing.</i>

05:29.372 --> 05:32.208
<i>I don't even hold kill codes
here at the DoD, Glenn.</i>

05:32.291 --> 05:34.544
<i>They're held at
the Defense Logistics Building,</i>

05:34.627 --> 05:36.754
<i>and I need an Arms Nullification order</i>

05:36.879 --> 05:39.674
<i>before I can request them
from Undersecretary Thomas.</i>

05:39.757 --> 05:41.134
Okay, fine.

05:41.259 --> 05:42.802
Red tape it is.

05:44.262 --> 05:47.140
Defense Logistics Building.
Did you get that, sir?

05:48.141 --> 05:49.225
Copy that.

05:57.942 --> 06:00.194
The team's just got to secure
that uplink in time.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.913
All right, here. This is us.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.752
Now, look, none of this works
unless you...

06:15.835 --> 06:17.378
We'll get the uplink.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.797
Coulson's just got to get
those codes in time.

06:19.881 --> 06:21.174
Okay.

06:23.676 --> 06:25.595
You sure this is gonna work?

06:26.429 --> 06:27.847
Nope.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.394
Ahh. Ahh!

06:33.978 --> 06:36.314
Many men on the moon.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.740
Stop it.

06:45.865 --> 06:46.908
Mmm.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.994
Andaz is an inch taller than I am.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.334
Undersecretary Thomas,

06:56.417 --> 06:58.211
thank you for getting
back to us so quickly.

06:58.628 --> 07:00.379
<i>General Talbot. General Andaz.</i>

07:00.797 --> 07:02.882
Yes, Undersecretary Thomas.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.675
I have an Arms Nullification order,

07:04.759 --> 07:06.511
and I need you to provide
the kill codes for...

07:06.594 --> 07:08.387
<i>The code must be provided in person.</i>

07:08.763 --> 07:12.016
I have a high-level ATCU agent
waiting outside right now.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.227
He's acting under my authority.

07:14.936 --> 07:16.312
<i>I'll need his credentials.</i>

07:17.855 --> 07:20.024
Oh, he has them. You bet.

07:21.818 --> 07:22.944
<i>Okay.</i>

07:24.987 --> 07:26.239
Launch sequence has begun, sir.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.715
Undersecretary Thomas.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.844
Very good.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.894
We're in. Uplink's established.

07:56.978 --> 07:58.396
Daisy's intel panned out.

07:58.813 --> 08:00.606
We got security feeds, too.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.150
Yeah, bonus.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.862
Every time I see his face,
I want to punch something.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.739
They've got us the uplink. Ready, sir.

08:11.117 --> 08:12.660
<i>Did you get it? Read it out to me.</i>

08:12.743 --> 08:15.788
Okay. It's... Oh.

08:15.872 --> 08:18.040
<i>We are at 20 seconds.
Give me the code, sir.</i>

08:18.124 --> 08:19.333
Okay, try to keep up.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.669
Bravo-5-Hotel-Niner-Mike-1-Charlie-1.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.463
<i>3-4-2-0-0-Niner. Sierra-Tango-1-3-5.</i>

08:24.589 --> 08:26.215
<i>Sierra-Whisky-0-1-2-0...</i>

08:26.299 --> 08:27.967
Come on, come on.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.312
The only thing you gave us
that didn't pan out was that word.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.147
You said he mentioned "absolution."

08:41.606 --> 08:43.607
Any idea what he meant?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.362
He thinks he's the saviour.

09:07.173 --> 09:08.299
Someone shut us down.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.426
That can only be done in the building.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.137
S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:13.221 --> 09:14.430
Again.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.683
Fix this.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.144
Bypass this override.

09:20.228 --> 09:24.649
Me? What... What can I do?
I'm not a flight systems engineer.

09:26.234 --> 09:27.818
No, you're not.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.698
So the only thing that's left to decide

09:32.782 --> 09:35.660
is whether to add your mind
to my current collection

09:36.494 --> 09:37.787
or just consume your flesh.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.956
No, I can handle it. I'll fix it, I swear.

09:40.039 --> 09:43.542
Please, don't do those things.

09:46.545 --> 09:50.007
You two, escort Dr Radcliffe
to the missile silo

09:53.010 --> 09:54.220
while I show S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.055
something they haven't seen
from me yet.

09:59.475 --> 10:00.643
Rage.

10:04.814 --> 10:07.316
<i>Start searching on the
main floor and work your way down.</i>

10:07.733 --> 10:11.279
<i>Any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents you find,
bring them to me.</i>

10:11.696 --> 10:13.614
Well, Fitz came through.
That's good, right?

10:13.698 --> 10:16.033
Well, we have pissed-off Inhumans
and a pissed-off Hive,

10:16.117 --> 10:17.285
so good and bad.

10:17.368 --> 10:19.328
But, I mean, at least Lash...

10:19.620 --> 10:21.622
At least Andrew didn't die in vain.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.792
The information Daisy brought back
has been useful.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.378
You're trying to make us feel better.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.715
Find meaning in Andrew's death
or what Daisy's done.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.258
Maybe.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.551
Don't do that.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.561
They know where we are.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.980
I need to move fast,

10:46.063 --> 10:48.065
make my way up to the silo
and secure the warhead.

10:48.149 --> 10:50.026
- Good luck.
- You, too.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.324
Okay.

10:56.866 --> 10:57.950
Let's see here.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.493
Your work, it's too slow.

11:00.578 --> 11:02.872
Well, I'm sorry
we all don't have super speed.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.582
Oh, this isn't about super speed.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.958
This is about your turtle speed.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.295
You work and then you stare
and work and then more staring.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.504
We have to go.

11:10.796 --> 11:11.881
Hurtful.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.508
Finish. We have to get the hostages.

11:14.592 --> 11:16.802
Well, if this doesn't work,
the hostages won't matter.

11:16.886 --> 11:18.846
Neither will we.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.557
'Cause if Hive gets through here,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.225
we're all dead.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.144
Or worse.

11:28.022 --> 11:29.982
Would you really use these?

11:33.736 --> 11:34.904
Good.

11:35.196 --> 11:37.948
Because I'd rather die
than be anyone's slave.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.456
I don't even know why
you're on this damned mission.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.957
It's too dangerous.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.670
That's why you should have this.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.797
What do you think you're doing?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.383
I'm giving you your cross back.
You need it more than I do.

11:55.466 --> 11:57.176
This isn't a lucky rabbit's foot.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.844
This is a symbol of faith.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.554
Who would return such a gift?

12:03.766 --> 12:06.394
Now, hurry. We're running out of time.

12:06.477 --> 12:07.895
You walked Mack through
the assembly?

12:07.978 --> 12:12.108
Yep, more times than I can count
and gave him written directions.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.859
And I think it's out of our hands now.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.861
Taking down Hive's up to the field team.

12:15.945 --> 12:17.822
They're not just fighting Hive.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.907
There's a legion of memories
inside him.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.952
They're up against
every soldier, every genius,

12:23.035 --> 12:24.787
every killer he's ever been.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.831
That's a lot of people to outsmart.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.165
Daisy's awake.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.251
Did she have any more information?

12:30.334 --> 12:31.877
Did she remember
what "absolution" means?

12:31.961 --> 12:33.337
I don't think she knows.

12:33.421 --> 12:34.880
Maybe it's buried too deep.

12:36.132 --> 12:37.758
We have to keep digging.

12:37.842 --> 12:40.928
All right. We don't have much time,
so let's just jump right in.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.180
Obviously, someone has fed a code
into the facility's network,

12:43.264 --> 12:45.558
thereby disabling the system.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.394
All I have to do is bypass it altogether

12:48.477 --> 12:51.564
and manually launch the missile.

12:51.647 --> 12:55.776
However, that situation
would require a rocket scientist

12:55.860 --> 12:59.321
or an engineer, and I am neither.

12:59.405 --> 13:01.532
Therefore, we're gonna
have to put our heads together

13:01.615 --> 13:03.367
and sort this out.

13:03.993 --> 13:07.204
I'm gonna call you Ronald and you...

13:08.539 --> 13:09.665
Ronald Two.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.250
Now, as I'm sure
you were both productive,

13:11.333 --> 13:15.045
intelligent members of society
before you became you.

13:15.129 --> 13:17.465
So, tell me,
have either of you retained any...

13:17.548 --> 13:21.177
Any knowledge from your past,
any computer skills,

13:21.260 --> 13:23.429
engineering, or mechanics?

13:24.472 --> 13:26.515
I don't know
if you remember what begging is,

13:26.599 --> 13:29.018
but this is exactly that,
so please give me something,

13:29.101 --> 13:31.645
because I don't have the tools to...

13:41.447 --> 13:42.781
All right. This is progress.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.700
Just keep pushing on.

13:55.503 --> 13:58.047
I know you're in here, Lincoln.

13:58.130 --> 14:00.007
It's useless to hide.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.803
I think it's time we had
a heart-to-heart, don't you?

14:05.471 --> 14:07.556
Sorry for taking Daisy from you.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.100
I know that hurt.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.144
She told me it would.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.488
Fitz entered the kill code in time.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.739
That's step one.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.491
And Hive?

14:25.824 --> 14:26.992
That's step two.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.039
Thank you for the update.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.626
I know you're doing everything
you can to try to jog your memory,

14:35.709 --> 14:36.877
but when he said "absolution..."

14:36.961 --> 14:39.004
I told her everything I know.

14:41.549 --> 14:43.425
Just like I told him.

14:44.552 --> 14:47.721
Once we get an update, so will you.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.816
You're a prisoner right now,
but that's temporary.

14:58.899 --> 15:02.152
You have to understand this...
This is a new situation.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.279
I understand.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.531
The security protocols are in place
to keep everyone safe.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.949
I get it.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.493
No one blames you for this.

15:09.868 --> 15:14.039
Then that's on you, because
I deserve the blame, all of it.

15:14.123 --> 15:16.333
And these protocols?

15:16.417 --> 15:18.043
Make them permanent,

15:18.127 --> 15:19.336
because I belong in this box.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.546
You're not a criminal.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.047
That's exactly what I am.

15:22.131 --> 15:23.966
So you can keep your forgiveness
and your pity

15:24.049 --> 15:26.427
because I shouldn't have either,

15:26.510 --> 15:27.761
or your friendship.

15:27.845 --> 15:28.887
Daisy,

15:31.015 --> 15:32.641
you were brainwashed.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.144
So was Ward.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.982
We make the perfect pair.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.567
<i>Daisy loved you.</i>

15:42.401 --> 15:44.778
At least, she thought she did.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.947
You deserve to know that.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.953
You have to understand, Lincoln,
I gave her something you never could.

15:53.704 --> 15:54.997
Happiness.

15:55.539 --> 16:00.085
True happiness comes from belonging.

16:00.169 --> 16:04.131
That's something she needs
that you could never offer her.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.925
Now, deep down, you know this.

16:08.636 --> 16:10.471
I made Daisy whole.

16:11.764 --> 16:13.265
And I can do the same for you.

16:13.557 --> 16:16.852
We can walk out of this room,
find her together.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.275
You're never gonna see Daisy again.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.572
Oh, go ahead. Destroy this body.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.366
It's well-worn.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.118
I'll just go in someone else.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.081
Maybe someone in S.H.I.E.L.D.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.876
<i>Hive didn't just get in your head.</i>

16:40.959 --> 16:43.712
He changed it on a fundamental level.

16:43.796 --> 16:46.298
He altered the chemistry of your brain
like a drug.

16:46.382 --> 16:47.841
These are the aftereffects.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.593
You're going through withdrawal
right now.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.346
Is that all you think this is?

16:55.099 --> 16:56.350
That I'm dope sick?

16:56.433 --> 16:57.768
You're not gonna feel like this forever.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.228
I want to.

16:59.770 --> 17:02.064
I want to feel this pain
until I find Hive.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.232
And get revenge?

17:04.983 --> 17:06.443
I can't imagine
what you've been through,

17:06.819 --> 17:08.529
but that craving?

17:10.114 --> 17:11.990
I know something about that.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.327
You think vengeance is
the missing piece of the puzzle,

17:15.411 --> 17:17.079
that it will make you whole again,

17:17.162 --> 17:19.998
but all it does is break you further.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.085
You're going to get better.

17:23.167 --> 17:26.003
It just takes time and distance.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.172
No.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.426
I should wake up every morning
and feel like this,

17:30.509 --> 17:33.429
remembering every drop of blood
I spilled.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.723
Do you still have the memory machine?

17:36.181 --> 17:37.516
You used it on that Strucker kid.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.768
- Daisy, stop.
- Put me in it.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.896
I bet you're already thinking about
doing that, right, to jog my memory?

17:42.980 --> 17:44.189
So bring it in here.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.817
Make it my bed
and keep every memory, every detail,

17:46.900 --> 17:48.235
right at the surface where it belongs.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.528
That's enough.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.367
We pulled the memory machine
out of storage.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.995
But it's not for you.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.168
Is it ready yet?

18:04.251 --> 18:05.335
Tell me it's ready!

18:05.419 --> 18:06.503
I need more time.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.259
Go.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.429
You guys, go. Get back! Run!

18:19.558 --> 18:21.560
I don't want to have to use these.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.937
- You don't need these.
- How did you...

18:24.521 --> 18:26.231
I watch you work slow. I move faster.

18:26.315 --> 18:27.691
Your turn.

18:27.775 --> 18:29.151
Ah!

18:35.407 --> 18:37.367
<i>If I ever see you again, I'll kill you.</i>

18:38.660 --> 18:40.204
This won't kill me!

18:40.871 --> 18:43.248
No. But it'll suck.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.423
Does this mean the plan worked?

18:52.549 --> 18:54.426
- It's doing something.
- The hostages.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.636
I know. I know.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.849
<i>- Closure.
- I thought we had a deal.</i>

19:00.933 --> 19:02.684
<i>I know that you care about us, Ward!</i>

19:02.768 --> 19:04.686
<i>I'm asking you to lead!</i>

19:06.480 --> 19:07.815
I can't hold this much longer.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.317
Do you think we've done it?
Fried his brain?

19:10.400 --> 19:11.985
Let's not wait around and find out.

19:22.538 --> 19:24.081
Do you believe I'm telling you the truth?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.416
Do you believe I'm telling you the truth?

19:28.544 --> 19:29.920
Yes.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.129
Of course we believe you.

19:34.550 --> 19:35.634
You have to go.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.345
Okay. Okay.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.432
Jemma.

19:42.516 --> 19:43.767
Jemma!

19:44.393 --> 19:45.686
Jemma, run! Go!

19:45.769 --> 19:47.104
Run! Run!

19:47.813 --> 19:50.774
Do you think the boss has gone
a little gonzo maybe?

19:51.316 --> 19:52.484
Together to the end.

19:52.568 --> 19:53.902
<i>Together to the end.</i>

19:53.986 --> 19:55.779
Together to the end.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.575
We have a connection... A connection.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.410
I want a connection.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.287
Ah!

20:03.745 --> 20:05.706
Well, at least you bring strength
to the table.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.165
That's never been my forte.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.627
Right, listen up.

20:11.253 --> 20:15.424
This is called a Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.302
Grunt along with me. Unified...

20:18.635 --> 20:20.470
On the ground, now!

20:22.264 --> 20:24.057
What the hell did you do to them?

20:24.141 --> 20:27.311
Well, it's not my finest work,
but I was under extreme duress.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.146
I want that warhead.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.170
- I'm here.
<i>- Good. You got to hurry.</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:55.839
Oh, Turtle Man wishes for me to hurry?

21:01.011 --> 21:02.095
Follow me.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.807
Come on.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.770
There are things about me...

21:10.729 --> 21:12.105
You wouldn't like me if you knew.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.315
<i>That you wouldn't like if you knew.</i>

21:13.398 --> 21:15.275
...wouldn't like me if you knew.

21:15.901 --> 21:17.027
Sir?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.488
Focus.

21:20.072 --> 21:21.239
Let us help you.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.951
I am not a good man, Skye.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.538
He wanted a connection.
A connection with her.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.248
You can't ever get attached to anyone.

21:30.332 --> 21:31.750
To anyone or anything.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.836
You have to fight that weakness in you.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.463
Fight that weakness!

21:36.546 --> 21:41.426
You have to fight
that weakness inside of you.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.304
Dude, what the actual hell?

21:44.388 --> 21:47.140
I need a connection.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.934
I want a connection.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.102
I want a connection.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.729
A connection.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.566
To connect, we have to

21:57.901 --> 21:59.194
disconnect.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.449
We need to disconnect it.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.368
Disconnect what?

22:06.451 --> 22:09.121
Disconnect the warhead.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.497
For absolution.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.543
So, you got that?

22:15.085 --> 22:16.420
Do you want to fill a brother in?

22:18.130 --> 22:19.172
I just wanted to save you.

22:19.256 --> 22:20.632
Save you.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.511
I gave you a fighting chance
to find a way out...

22:24.636 --> 22:26.722
<i>... find a way out, like you always do.</i>

22:28.015 --> 22:29.558
Like you did.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.275
You want me to cross them off?

23:07.721 --> 23:09.806
Did S.H.I.E.L.D. send you? Did they?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.850
Yes. I'm with S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.477
Oh, thank God.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.603
Take me with you.

23:14.978 --> 23:16.229
You have to, please.

23:18.607 --> 23:19.649
Oh, no.

23:21.109 --> 23:22.360
Giyera.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.571
He's taking the warhead.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.699
Damn!

23:28.283 --> 23:29.743
We have to move!

23:29.951 --> 23:31.244
Come on!

23:41.713 --> 23:43.215
Let's go, people! Move, move!

23:43.298 --> 23:45.467
We need to get away
from this place now! Go!

23:45.884 --> 23:47.052
She did good.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.845
Look at all these people.

23:48.929 --> 23:51.473
Yeah, good thing we brought
the really small plane to carry them.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.599
We'll have room.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.811
We're adding another one! Come on.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.524
Wait!

24:03.944 --> 24:05.278
What did you do to me?

24:05.362 --> 24:06.988
The only thing we could think of.

24:29.636 --> 24:30.846
Did we just...

24:30.929 --> 24:32.139
Yeah, we did.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.807
We caught Hive.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.313
Yes! Whoo!

24:48.280 --> 24:49.865
Is everything okay?

24:50.323 --> 24:51.867
What's going on?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.135
<i>The hostages are free.</i>

25:10.218 --> 25:12.637
We got Hive. Finally, some success.

25:12.721 --> 25:13.805
I have to admit,

25:13.889 --> 25:17.851
your sending Inhumans in after him,
I thought that was a stupid gamble.

25:17.934 --> 25:19.269
Seriously stupid.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.939
Like betting on <i>WrestleMania</i> stupid.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.860
You were right.
You knew what you were doing.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.404
Congratulations, Coulson.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.364
The mission isn't a success yet.

25:31.448 --> 25:32.991
The warhead's still in play,

25:33.074 --> 25:35.410
laced with a pathogen that
could alter humanity as we know it.

25:35.493 --> 25:38.205
I'm well aware
of what it's capable of doing.

25:38.288 --> 25:40.707
I've got a crew running clean-up
in the facility right now.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.210
I think they've rounded up
a few of those freaks already.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.586
I think you mean "victims."

25:44.669 --> 25:46.796
Look, I don't want one more soul
on this planet

25:46.880 --> 25:48.340
to end up looking like that.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.467
We need to reverse
what that monster's done,

25:50.550 --> 25:52.886
and you got to find somebody
to help us figure out how.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.638
Start with him.

25:55.263 --> 25:56.848
He's the one
that turned those people into...

25:56.932 --> 25:58.016
Primitives. Primitives.

25:58.099 --> 26:00.185
I call them Primitives.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.229
Radcliffe, Dr Holden Radcliffe.

26:06.691 --> 26:09.736
And I really can't apologise enough
for what's happened to those people.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.196
No. You really can't.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.281
But I'm also a victim here.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.408
I was forced to develop that formula.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.035
You better do right by those people.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.246
I can tell by your moustache

26:19.329 --> 26:21.331
that you're a man of importance
and not to be trifled with,

26:21.414 --> 26:24.334
so I will be absolutely honest with you.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.419
The process is irreversible.

26:26.503 --> 26:29.047
And I can tell by your beady little eyes
that you're a worm.

26:29.130 --> 26:31.007
So let me be absolutely honest
with you.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.510
If you don't find a solution
to this problem,

26:33.593 --> 26:34.761
you're gonna end up looking

26:34.844 --> 26:36.554
like one of those mouth-breathers
you made.

26:38.390 --> 26:39.432
You understand?

26:39.641 --> 26:41.351
How could I not?

26:45.772 --> 26:48.316
Almost as scary as Hive, that one.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.824
Remember us?

26:55.907 --> 26:57.659
<i>Fitz and Simmons
are working with Dr Radcliffe</i>

26:57.742 --> 26:59.828
<i>on a way to counter the effects
of Hive's formula,</i>

26:59.911 --> 27:01.329
but that's a long shot.

27:01.413 --> 27:04.624
The threat has to be neutralised
before it comes close to detonating.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.376
We need to find Hive's base
of operations

27:06.501 --> 27:08.878
and get the jump on his people.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.298
They might make
our search easier for us.

27:11.381 --> 27:13.133
As long as we have Hive,
they're gonna come for him.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.551
We'll be ready.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.886
I want everyone on high alert
and the base sealed off.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.221
That includes the hangar door.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.724
Yeah, parts for its hydraulics
finally came in.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.891
Already got a team on it.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.310
What can I do, sir?

27:23.393 --> 27:24.561
You've done enough.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.979
Mack filled me in on your performance.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.063
Well done.

27:27.188 --> 27:29.065
I just want this to be over.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.234
Remember, I told you,

27:31.318 --> 27:34.571
I decide if you get to be
a part of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

27:34.988 --> 27:36.906
I think you'd make a great agent.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.703
You also said that I had to want it.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.083
I don't think that I do.

27:48.585 --> 27:51.087
You got a lot of good people
on this team.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.089
Real heroes.

27:53.173 --> 27:54.674
That's not me.

27:55.383 --> 27:57.010
Once we're done with Hive,

27:57.594 --> 27:59.763
I'm done with all of it, I think.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.765
Just like that?

28:04.017 --> 28:05.268
I mean, what are you gonna do?

28:06.102 --> 28:07.437
I don't know, Mack.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.938
Trying to figure that out.

28:09.064 --> 28:10.106
See the world.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.524
I think that's a mistake, Lincoln.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.693
You have a future here at S.H.I.E.L.D.

28:13.777 --> 28:15.362
What about Daisy?

28:18.865 --> 28:22.869
There's nothing I have to offer Daisy
that she wants or needs.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.454
I know that now.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.956
Is anyone gonna talk to her,

28:27.290 --> 28:28.875
at least let her know we have Hive?

28:28.958 --> 28:30.710
That's not a great idea right now.

28:30.794 --> 28:32.879
We need to stick
to the security protocols.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.048
You got to be kidding me.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.140
Should we stop him?

28:44.265 --> 28:45.642
I don't think we can.

28:53.441 --> 28:54.901
We got him.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.114
Hive.

29:00.824 --> 29:04.244
Safe, sound, and catatonic
in a Gel-Matrix chamber.

29:05.453 --> 29:07.163
I thought you'd want to know.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.125
Thanks.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.335
But you should be in the module.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.129
The protocols are for your own safety.

29:16.339 --> 29:19.676
You think I give a damn
about security protocols?

29:20.301 --> 29:21.845
You're my partner.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.765
We're not partners any more.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.685
So just leave.

29:30.311 --> 29:32.522
You remember
what happened last time.

29:33.690 --> 29:34.983
Yeah.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.488
And I forgive you.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.703
I didn't ask for that.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.706
That's too bad.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.542
I forgive you.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.963
No, don't be stupid. Get away, okay?

29:57.464 --> 29:58.465
No. Just get...

29:58.548 --> 30:00.133
- It's okay, Daisy. It's okay.
- Get away...

30:00.216 --> 30:02.552
- Get... Get away!
- Daisy, it's okay.

30:02.635 --> 30:03.720
No!

30:12.228 --> 30:14.147
I don't deserve this.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.241
I've only scratched the surface

30:25.366 --> 30:26.910
of the thumb drive
that Radcliffe gave us,

30:26.993 --> 30:30.413
and I can already see that
he was in way over his head.

30:30.497 --> 30:33.082
His enhancements rely on technology.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.001
These changes are pure bio.

30:35.084 --> 30:37.337
The parasite in his formula

30:37.420 --> 30:40.089
actually attaches itself
to strands of DNA.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.341
We'll find a cure.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.177
Possibly, in a decade or so.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.428
What are you working on?

30:45.553 --> 30:46.763
Oh, nothing.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.599
Just browsing some things.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.856
You're a terrible liar.

30:59.025 --> 31:02.737
Well, it was supposed to be a surprise.

31:03.071 --> 31:04.948
Booking a trip?

31:06.032 --> 31:07.450
For two.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.037
That's a romantic gesture.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.291
How very not you

31:16.543 --> 31:17.627
to be romantic.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.128
What? Of...

31:19.629 --> 31:20.713
That is ridiculous.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.882
We both know that I'm the romantic one.

31:22.966 --> 31:27.387
But it might not be the best time
to be skipping off to the...

31:28.596 --> 31:29.973
Seychelles.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.225
Does look nice.

31:32.308 --> 31:33.476
Hive's in custody,

31:33.601 --> 31:35.311
S.H.I.E.L.D. is going
to recover that warhead,

31:35.436 --> 31:37.772
and then I was thinking that...

31:38.815 --> 31:42.402
We've had enough tragedy.
A little fun wouldn't kill us.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.905
You think I'm not romantic?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.992
I'm gonna do something with you
on that island

31:49.117 --> 31:51.411
that will take your breath away.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.079
What is... Are you?

31:53.162 --> 31:54.497
Are you? Are you? What?

31:54.998 --> 31:56.082
Snorkeling.

31:56.165 --> 31:58.501
Did you know
there are over 1,000 species of fish

31:58.626 --> 31:59.919
in the Seychelles?

32:00.003 --> 32:01.671
I cannot wait.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.174
Everything all right?

32:06.426 --> 32:09.345
Yeah. I need to go inspect
the Gel-Matrix chamber

32:09.470 --> 32:11.598
and sign off before they can bring Hive
into the base.

32:17.937 --> 32:18.980
Is this yours?

32:19.355 --> 32:21.357
No. I think it's Yo-Yo's.

32:22.358 --> 32:23.484
All right.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.529
I'll give it to her.

32:33.286 --> 32:34.704
You're a man of faith.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.041
You know I am.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.962
So what was it like,
coming face-to-face with the devil?

32:43.963 --> 32:45.006
Hive?

32:47.342 --> 32:50.845
Well, he's evil, scary as all hell,

32:52.347 --> 32:54.557
but I don't think he's the devil.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.976
You don't get it.

32:57.060 --> 33:00.146
When Hive takes over a body,

33:00.229 --> 33:03.650
he steals that person's memories.

33:03.733 --> 33:06.027
That's as close to stealing a soul
as you can get.

33:08.071 --> 33:11.741
"Memory is the scribe of the soul."

33:14.410 --> 33:15.495
The Bible?

33:15.578 --> 33:17.163
Aristotle.

33:18.915 --> 33:21.417
What? I have dimensions.

33:24.045 --> 33:27.507
Look, Tremors,
I've had my mind controlled.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.259
No, this wasn't that.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.012
The worst part about Hive is,

33:33.096 --> 33:36.891
when he's making you hurt
the people you care about,

33:37.600 --> 33:39.852
he makes you love him for it.

33:40.269 --> 33:41.521
If Hive isn't the devil,

33:41.604 --> 33:44.190
he's the closest thing to it
you and I will ever see.

33:44.732 --> 33:46.275
It's not safe.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.361
If he got out, he...

33:48.444 --> 33:49.946
He's not getting out.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.948
He can't be contained.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.616
He has to be destroyed.

33:57.036 --> 34:01.290
You know another thing
the devil is capable of?

34:05.545 --> 34:07.630
Filling a person

34:09.799 --> 34:11.551
with so much anger

34:12.885 --> 34:15.054
and so many dark thoughts

34:16.139 --> 34:18.056
that it consumes them.

34:22.395 --> 34:26.649
But it's up to that individual
to make a choice.

34:26.733 --> 34:31.654
Either let the darkness fester and grow,

34:32.655 --> 34:35.908
or let the light inside shine through

34:36.451 --> 34:38.578
and vanquish the darkness.

34:41.330 --> 34:44.292
This isn't about revenge.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.835
Hey.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.005
We're safe.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.424
<i>Coulson's sealing up the base.</i>

35:00.975 --> 35:04.103
Gel's stable.
Power's strong enough for transport.

35:04.187 --> 35:06.773
Make sure you reconnect that
once it's inside and secure.

35:06.856 --> 35:08.149
You got it.

35:08.775 --> 35:12.195
When's the bloody hangar door
gonna get closed, O'Brien?

35:12.528 --> 35:13.780
We've got engineers on it.

35:13.863 --> 35:16.365
We had to wait a few days.
Parts were delayed.

35:40.515 --> 35:41.557
O'Brien! Wait!

36:11.879 --> 36:13.256
What is it? What's happening?

36:13.339 --> 36:15.341
Jemma, there was an explosion
in the hangar.

36:15.424 --> 36:16.509
Fitz.

36:20.555 --> 36:22.932
Okay. What do we do?

36:26.102 --> 36:27.520
Let's get out of here!

36:35.278 --> 36:36.779
No, no, no! The lockdown.

36:36.863 --> 36:38.197
Hey! Hey, help!

36:38.281 --> 36:39.699
They're trapped inside.

36:39.782 --> 36:40.867
Can we override the doors?

36:40.950 --> 36:42.034
We put everything on lockdown.

36:42.118 --> 36:44.412
By the time we override, Fitz will be...

36:48.958 --> 36:51.043
Fitz, do you read?

36:51.127 --> 36:53.379
Yeah! Sir, I'm in a bit of trouble!

36:53.462 --> 36:55.131
We know.
We're gonna get you out of there.

36:58.301 --> 37:00.469
No, no, no! Stay away from them!
Stay away from the gas!

37:01.637 --> 37:03.973
- We have to get out of the hangar!
- Come on.

37:04.098 --> 37:05.308
No, no, no.
There's nothing you can do for them.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.726
We have to get back out to the base.

37:08.436 --> 37:10.313
Hey! How are you doing in there?

37:10.396 --> 37:11.981
Fitz, it's the lockdown. We can't...

37:12.064 --> 37:14.317
The motion sensors!
You have to get them working again.

37:19.989 --> 37:21.240
<i>If we isolate them from the system,</i>

37:21.324 --> 37:22.825
<i>can we get around the lockdown?</i>

37:22.909 --> 37:24.327
Yes! You can fry the bridging,

37:24.452 --> 37:27.580
which connects the sensor system
to the security protocol!

37:27.663 --> 37:28.748
I can do that.

37:28.831 --> 37:31.667
No, the server system is on
the other side of the base. It won't work.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.169
Well, we need to do something fast.

37:34.337 --> 37:37.423
Fitz, Professor Vaughn's
third-year compiler theory?

37:37.506 --> 37:40.009
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Do that! Fast, please!</i>

37:40.134 --> 37:43.179
I'm not an engineer.
I hope I can recreate what you did there.

37:43.262 --> 37:46.182
No, no, no! You saw me do it!
You have a good memory!

37:46.265 --> 37:47.934
<i>I mean, you do, right?</i>

37:56.025 --> 37:57.109
Hey, it's open! It's open!

38:17.546 --> 38:18.965
Thank you, Jemma.

38:20.883 --> 38:23.302
What the hell is Professor Vaughn's
third-year compiler theory?

38:23.386 --> 38:24.679
It's complicated.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.173
Well, that's not good.

39:01.257 --> 39:02.508
If Hive gets out of stasis...

39:02.591 --> 39:03.676
It's not an "if."

39:03.759 --> 39:04.927
No. It's not.

39:05.011 --> 39:07.013
At least we sealed off the hangar.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.764
But there are S.H.I.E.L.D.
personnel in there.

39:08.848 --> 39:11.100
They're gone.
We have to cut our losses.

39:11.434 --> 39:12.601
It's all we can do.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.783
I can't believe this is happening.

39:34.123 --> 39:35.374
He wants a way out.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.543
- No.
- What?

39:37.626 --> 39:38.711
Daisy, what is it?

39:39.462 --> 39:41.464
I told him everything.

39:41.589 --> 39:42.965
Yeah, we know that,
but what does that have to do...

39:43.090 --> 39:45.217
No, Mack, I told him everything,

39:45.301 --> 39:47.803
including the plans to the Zephyr.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.557
And the fact that it has
high-altitude capabilities...

39:51.640 --> 39:54.143
Hive has his delivery system now.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.746
- Daisy.
- She's safe in her cell.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.581
- Which is where you two should be.
- Not a chance.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.249
You can put the vests on us,
but we fight.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.417
We don't have time for this.

40:18.501 --> 40:21.087
Daisy said Hive knows everything
the Zephyr's capable of.

40:21.170 --> 40:22.254
If he gets his hands on it...

40:22.338 --> 40:23.506
That's his new missile.

40:23.631 --> 40:25.174
And we brought him right to it.

40:25.299 --> 40:26.509
<i>He still looks shaky.</i>

40:26.634 --> 40:28.010
<i>Maybe he won't remember how to fly it.</i>

40:28.094 --> 40:30.179
<i>That's a thin hope to hang on to.</i>

40:30.513 --> 40:33.474
<i>We can't let Hive
gain control of that ship.</i>

40:46.987 --> 40:48.364
We need to get someone in there.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.615
I can't ask anyone to do that.

40:49.698 --> 40:51.867
I can go in. The gas won't change me.

40:51.951 --> 40:52.952
No, but it can sway you.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.121
<i>I won't let what happened to Daisy
happen to anyone else.</i>

41:00.376 --> 41:01.961
Take a breath.

41:04.046 --> 41:06.215
You don't need to think
of the whole solution.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.717
Just... Just part of it. Right?

41:15.391 --> 41:19.353
Pieces... Solving a puzzle.

41:20.146 --> 41:21.230
Hey.

41:25.568 --> 41:26.902
Sorry.

41:28.737 --> 41:29.822
Having trouble.

41:29.905 --> 41:31.699
My memories.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.328
You were in that one.

41:37.204 --> 41:41.375
Do you have any idea
what you did to me?

41:43.419 --> 41:44.712
Yes.

41:45.379 --> 41:46.547
I remember.

41:50.092 --> 41:51.760
You're in pain.

42:09.612 --> 42:10.946
Please...

42:14.700 --> 42:16.702
Take me back.
