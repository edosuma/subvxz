an airplane?

that the standard way

01:57.267 --> 01:59.432
almost all airlines use
to board their planes,

01:59.433 --> 02:01.066
from back to front, is, in fact,

02:01.067 --> 02:03.399
the slowest

02:03.400 --> 02:05.066
to get people onto an airplane.

we need to investigate.

what i was thinking.

of getting up, up, and away?

we need a plane

a 173-seat airplane interior

03:33.667 --> 03:36.966

most used by commercial airlines

about teeth.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.566
Okay. Go on.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.132
All right, you remember
when we tested ice bullet

05:51.133 --> 05:52.732
and how it was
the perfect assassination tool

05:52.733 --> 05:54.866
'cause you could never trace
the bullet?

05:54.867 --> 05:56.132
Oh, yeah, it was busted,

05:56.133 --> 05:57.799
but the idea was
that the bullet would melt

05:57.800 --> 05:58.932
and there would be no evidence.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.266
Yep. It's similar.

Except instead of an ice bullet,
it's a tooth bullet.

06:02.700 --> 06:03.966
Now, the myth says

06:03.967 --> 06:06.166
it has enough mass
for penetration and accuracy,

06:06.167 --> 06:08.199
but the best part is,
once it hits its target,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.132
it breaks up
into little fragments.

The team wants to know

06:16.933 --> 06:20.066
if you can make a viable bullet
from a human tooth.

06:20.067 --> 06:25.132
Supposedly, dental projectiles
are aerodynamically accurate,

06:25.133 --> 06:27.466
they have a lethal
penetrating power,

06:27.467 --> 06:30.532
and they shatter on impact
and can't be detected

06:30.533 --> 06:34.632
by even the foremost
forensic pathologist.

06:34.633 --> 06:36.566

doesn't actually state

06:36.567 --> 06:38.799
what kind of ammunition
the teeth are made into,

06:38.800 --> 06:41.066

a secret stash.

07:04.467 --> 07:08.066
These are actual human teeth
that have been extracted

07:08.067 --> 07:10.066
that were given to us
by a dentist.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.066
These are canines and molars.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.566
We're gonna carve these up

07:13.567 --> 07:16.667
and hopefully fit them
into bullet casings.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.299
Hi.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.066
Now, making a tooth
into a bullet,

07:21.067 --> 07:23.499
we're faced with some
really unique tooth anatomy,

07:23.500 --> 07:26.566
because we really want this
to be as hard as it can be.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.466
Now, the enamel
is the hard part,

07:28.467 --> 07:29.899
but this is just the shell.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.632
Then you start getting
into the dentin and the pulp.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.899
That's where it's gonna get
weaker and weaker.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.266
So we don't actually want

07:36.267 --> 07:38.466
to compromise
the integrity of the tooth

07:38.467 --> 07:39.599
by grinding it down,

07:39.600 --> 07:41.099
but we also have to actually

07:41.100 --> 07:43.866
make these teeth fit
into the shells.

07:43.867 --> 07:45.966
Narrator:
It's clearly going to be tricky,

07:45.967 --> 07:48.399
but the myth doesn't specify
the gun and ammo.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.066
It simply states
that a bullet made from a tooth

07:52.067 --> 07:53.966
will fool a pathologist.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.699
Smells like the dentist.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.132
Narrator: So the team
will test three options.

07:58.133 --> 08:01.199
Tory will re-engineer
a shotgun shell

08:01.200 --> 08:03.066

08:03.067 --> 08:05.499
I can't want to sink my teeth
into this myth.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.132
Narrator: Grant will add
a little bite to a rifle round.

08:08.133 --> 08:12.299
And kari will modify
a handgun round with a molar.

08:12.300 --> 08:15.099
Okay, so I'm pulling the .38
bullets out of the cartridges,

08:15.100 --> 08:16.299
replacing the powder,

08:16.300 --> 08:19.432
and then replacing the bullets
with a tooth.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.732
I'm using a small silicone bead
to seat it

08:21.733 --> 08:24.399
and to seal
the top of the bullet.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.866
Narrator: Kari thinks

08:25.867 --> 08:29.099
retaining as much hard enamel
as possible is crucial,

08:29.100 --> 08:32.366
so she's decided not to shape
her handgun bullets.

08:32.367 --> 08:35.499
The downside
will be with accuracy.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.066
I'm really skeptical
that this is gonna work.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.199
Why?

08:38.200 --> 08:40.499
For one, i think we have
an aerodynamics problem.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.066
I think it's gonna not
get anywhere near the target.

08:43.067 --> 08:46.732
That is, if it actually survives
coming out of the barrel.

08:46.733 --> 08:49.366
That being said, if it does,

08:49.367 --> 08:51.632
i think this would really hurt
if it hit you.

08:51.633 --> 08:54.632
Narrator: Meanwhile,
Grant has a different strategy.

08:54.633 --> 08:58.932
He thinks shaping the teeth
for maximum aerodynamic accuracy

08:58.933 --> 09:00.399
is essential.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.599
So, I'm grinding around the edge
of the tooth,

09:03.600 --> 09:07.499
and this is so that it can fit
inside of the jacket

09:07.500 --> 09:09.432
a little bit deeper,

09:09.433 --> 09:13.166
and then I'll seal around
the edges with some epoxy.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.199
And the powder, of course,
will be inside here.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.266
And when it's done,

09:16.267 --> 09:18.666
it's gonna look
something like that.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.666
Narrator:
Tory, on the other hand,

09:20.667 --> 09:22.599
has it slightly easier.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.332
Now, kari and Grant
have a hard job

09:24.333 --> 09:26.966
'cause they actually have
to make a bullet out of a tooth.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.432
This myth is like pulling teeth.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.366
Me, i don't have to modify
my teeth.

09:31.367 --> 09:32.466
Why?

09:32.467 --> 09:34.066
Because I'm gonna be using
a shotgun shell.

09:34.067 --> 09:37.232
Now, this is a cross-section
of a shotgun shell.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.366
What we have here is our charge.

09:39.367 --> 09:41.366
This is our plug,
and this is our shot.

09:41.367 --> 09:42.566
Now, once this sets off,

09:42.567 --> 09:44.799
the pressure builds up,
it pushes the plug,

09:44.800 --> 09:46.732
sending the shot
towards the target.

09:46.733 --> 09:48.466
You know what time it is?

09:48.467 --> 09:50.432
Tooth-irty.
[2:30]

09:50.433 --> 09:53.199
All i need to do
is replace the shot with teeth

09:53.200 --> 09:55.566
and take my shot.

09:55.567 --> 09:56.766
Narrator:
Back over with Grant...

09:56.767 --> 09:57.767
Grant: There you go.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.199
Tooth bullet.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.799
Narrator: And he's got
his rifle rounds ready to roll.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.866
He's also got a plan "b."

10:03.867 --> 10:05.899
"B" for bone.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.366
Okay, so what i needed

10:07.367 --> 10:10.566
was the biggest bone we could
find that was readily available,

10:10.567 --> 10:13.632
and this cow femur was left over
from a butcher shop.

10:13.633 --> 10:15.932
See if i can get a bullet
out of it.

10:15.933 --> 10:18.633
Narrator: Of course,
the myth is about teeth.

10:20.033 --> 10:23.199
Grant:
Oh, we have juices!

10:23.200 --> 10:25.432
Narrator: But Grant is going
with the spirit of the myth,

10:25.433 --> 10:28.099
and that's a bullet
made of biological material

10:28.100 --> 10:30.632
that will disintegrate
on impact.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.232
And the benefit of bone

10:32.233 --> 10:35.832
is that it can be shaped
more effectively than the teeth

10:35.833 --> 10:38.199
for a more aerodynamic result.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.632
My masterpiece is complete.

10:40.633 --> 10:45.199
So, I'm done with
my .38 very special bullets,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.066
but the teeth don't have

10:47.067 --> 10:48.999
the same mass
as the original bullet,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.499
so they're not gonna have
the same destructive force.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.132
They also aren't symmetrical,

10:53.133 --> 10:54.699
so i have a feeling

10:54.700 --> 10:57.732
accuracy is gonna be
a serious issue.

10:57.733 --> 10:59.466
Still, they're teeth bullets.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.567
It's cool.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.932
Narrator:
Coming up on "mythbusters,"

for our volunteer boarders.

to bite the bullet?

[ Bell dings ]

11:29.133 --> 11:32.066
Narrator:
It's a frustrating constant
of commercial airline travel.

11:32.067 --> 11:36.499
Boarding a plane always seems
to take longer than it should.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.199
But is it down to the
back-to-front boarding system?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.732
To find out, captain savage
and co-pilot hyneman

11:43.733 --> 11:46.132
have replicated
a commercial boarding scenario

11:46.133 --> 11:48.766
with a team
of real flight attendants.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.832
Here's how
this is gonna go down.

11:50.833 --> 11:53.866
Every single one of
our mythbust air test passengers

11:53.867 --> 11:55.199
will be issued a ticket
just like this one

11:55.200 --> 11:56.932
with a specific seat assignment,

11:56.933 --> 11:59.899
and they will board the plane
through our gate right here.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.266
Boop.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.399
As they come aboard,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.732
our cabin manager Sylvia
will check them in

12:04.733 --> 12:07.232
and send them on their way
to the correct seat.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.066
The rest of our cabin crew
will be stationed

12:09.067 --> 12:10.932
just as they would be
on a real airplane,

12:10.933 --> 12:13.499
assisting the passengers
in stowing their luggage.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.532
When the luggage is stowed
and everybody's properly seated,

12:16.533 --> 12:18.566
the flight attendants
will call time,

12:18.567 --> 12:20.266
and the boarding is complete.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.332
We'll be assessing
each of our boarding techniques

12:22.333 --> 12:23.899
on two main metrics.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.132
The first one being

12:25.133 --> 12:27.466
how the boarding method felt
to the passengers.

12:27.467 --> 12:30.066
So as our test subjects de-plane
from each test,

12:30.067 --> 12:33.499
we will ask them to vote here
on how the test felt to them,

12:33.500 --> 12:35.966
whether they thought
it was great, just okay,

12:35.967 --> 12:37.732
or, in fact, terrible.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.766
And the second part
of the monitoring

12:39.767 --> 12:42.832
will be done by me up here
with this timer,

12:42.833 --> 12:45.266
and that will determine
how long the test took.

12:45.267 --> 12:47.832
What about people
who gum up the works, you ask?

12:47.833 --> 12:49.299
I'm glad you mentioned that.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.166
In about 5%
of our ticket envelopes

12:52.167 --> 12:53.799
and consistent
across all of our tests,

12:53.800 --> 12:56.566
we've included instructions
for some of our test subjects

12:56.567 --> 12:58.966
to behave
just like those passengers

12:58.967 --> 13:00.832
who do slow boarding down.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.232
The personality types
we've identified are

13:03.233 --> 13:05.399
parents with tiny children,

13:05.400 --> 13:07.732
people who go to the bathroom
during boarding

13:07.733 --> 13:09.599
and have to swim upstream
to get back to their seat,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.099
people who sit
in the wrong seat,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.399
and people with suit coats

13:13.400 --> 13:15.432
who meticulously fold them
in the aisle

13:15.433 --> 13:17.399
before putting them
on their luggage.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.566

The wild cards,
accurate boarding scenario,

13:22.733 --> 13:25.899
and experienced cabin crew
will provide the realism.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.066
And the time and customer
satisfaction scores

13:29.067 --> 13:31.066
will give
each of the boarding methods

13:31.067 --> 13:34.499
a comparative
and quantitative score.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.599
Nearly 200 volunteers
with their carry-on baggage

13:37.600 --> 13:40.432
have generously given up
their day to queue for science.

13:40.433 --> 13:42.566

is the control,

13:42.567 --> 13:45.899
supposedly the slowest
of all systems.

people are most familiar with.

of the replicate setup

14:30.833 --> 14:33.066
soon become clear.

14:33.067 --> 14:37.432
The open-sided structure allows
full access to the cameras,

14:37.433 --> 14:40.432
and we can really see
how the boarding is progressing.

having to get up

14:57.900 --> 15:00.532
to allow access to the middle
and window seats,

15:00.533 --> 15:04.066
and inevitably, there is plenty
of carry-on luggage

15:04.067 --> 15:07.266
too large to fit
in the overhead compartments.

for you.

It's not just excess baggage
delaying departure.

15:18.733 --> 15:23.132
The wild cards also gum up
the works in a realistic way.

But eventually,
everyone is seated,

15:25.967 --> 15:27.799
and the plane is ready
for wheels up.

15:29.233 --> 15:30.632

But what's the damage?

15:30.633 --> 15:32.632
From the time
that boarding was announced

15:32.633 --> 15:35.599
to the time
that the last bin was closed,

15:35.600 --> 15:40.399
for back-to-front boarding,
it was 24:29.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.866
Now, that's a fairly common
method of boarding,

15:42.867 --> 15:45.866
and that'll form our baseline
for the other tests.

15:45.867 --> 15:48.566

The time is, of course,
crucial for that comparison,

15:48.567 --> 15:50.866
but so is customer satisfaction.

is scored +1.

which, for back-to-front,
gives a final tally of +19.

mean anything on their own.

they want to know
will their bullets even work?

Will they have
lethal penetration

for our accuracy test

from the cluster.

meant that from just 21 feet,

So, in order for us
to call our teeth shot accurate,

You know what?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.332
I think we have to give it
to the teeth,

in the same area
as the buckshot.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.932
That's a success.

18:43.933 --> 18:47.132
In a weapon designed to fire
its shot over a short distance,

18:47.133 --> 18:49.732
the teeth more or less matched
the real thing.

18:49.733 --> 18:52.532

the shotgun has qualified
for the next stage.

a couple inches.

that while it may not be lethal,

22:28.733 --> 22:31.266
it would certainly cause
severe injury,

to take it on to the next round.

has to penetrate to four inches

in the satisfaction score,

of the result.

The method in use by

the best available.

into windows, middle, aisle

there will just be

were not bbs, but teeth.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.066
And finally, even if the wound
had been near the mouth,

36:29.067 --> 36:31.266
just like the bone fragments,

36:31.267 --> 36:34.232
the doc would easily have
detected the foreign material.

36:34.233 --> 36:36.199
You can't fool
the forensic pathologist.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
This one's busted.

36:37.201 --> 36:38.332
Definitely busted.

36:38.333 --> 36:39.699
Totally busted.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.399
Thank you so much for your help.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.766
Thank you.
Did you have fun?

36:42.767 --> 36:44.399
I had a lot of fun, thank you.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.532
Yeah, i didn't.

36:45.533 --> 36:46.832
[ Laughs ]
That was disgusting.

36:46.833 --> 36:49.866
This myth is all about
creating a lethal projectile

36:49.867 --> 36:53.232
without leaving enough evidence
to tie you back to the crime.

36:53.233 --> 36:56.966
As far as our bone bullet goes,
it had excellent accuracy,

36:56.967 --> 36:58.299
great penetration,

36:58.300 --> 37:00.666
and it even shattered
inside of the pig.

37:00.667 --> 37:03.699
But unfortunately,
there were enough fragments left

37:03.700 --> 37:05.332
that the forensic pathologist

37:05.333 --> 37:07.732
could glue
the entire thing back together

37:07.733 --> 37:11.299
and reveal the rifling marks
along the length of the bullet,

37:11.300 --> 37:13.966
which is enough
to tie you back to the weapon.

37:13.967 --> 37:15.399
Now, with the teeth shot,

37:15.400 --> 37:18.799
she looked at it and instantly
realized it was a shotgun wound.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.232
Nice work, Dr. Judy.

37:21.233 --> 37:22.732
I got a molar.

37:22.733 --> 37:24.632
Look at that.
Relentless.

37:24.633 --> 37:25.899
Narrator:
It's a definitive result.

37:25.900 --> 37:29.066
The slugs may have been
moderately accurate

37:29.067 --> 37:30.166
and barely lethal.

37:30.167 --> 37:31.832
Yeah,
that's a really tight group.

37:31.833 --> 37:36.066
But the crucial criterion was,
could they fool the pathologist?

37:36.067 --> 37:41.500
And on that, they failed,
meaning this myth is busted.

37:46.567 --> 37:50.066
With the help of an excited
plane load of volunteers...

37:50.067 --> 37:53.399
Oh, we hit a little turbulence.
Whoo!

37:53.400 --> 37:54.666
Narrator:
Adam and Jamie are asking

37:54.667 --> 37:57.066
if airlines around the world
have got it wrong.

37:57.067 --> 38:00.499
And next up
is an experiment in anarchy.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.866
After business class,

38:01.867 --> 38:03.632
it's every passenger
for themselves.

38:03.633 --> 38:05.366
Now all the rest of you,

38:05.367 --> 38:08.866
there are no assigned seats
and no assigned rows,

38:08.867 --> 38:10.766
so when i say, which is now,

38:10.767 --> 38:12.566
you can all board the airplane.

38:12.567 --> 38:14.066
Whoa!

38:14.067 --> 38:17.266
In an orderly fashion.

38:17.267 --> 38:19.266
[ Laughter ]

38:19.267 --> 38:20.499
Wow.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.632
Narrator:
In the earlier random test,

38:22.633 --> 38:24.199
there were assigned seats.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.099
But this is just a free-for-all.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.232
Jamie:
This is interesting.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.566
There's no assigned seating,
no order at all,

38:29.567 --> 38:31.066
and so what they're doing

38:31.067 --> 38:33.932
is actually the opposite
of the back-to-front.

38:33.933 --> 38:37.799
They're filling up the front
first and then going backwards,

38:37.800 --> 38:39.832
which doesn't seem

38:39.833 --> 38:42.099
like it would be the most
efficient way of doing it

38:42.100 --> 38:44.299
because they're blocking
the aisle

38:44.300 --> 38:45.932
right in the beginning
of the plane.

38:45.933 --> 38:47.966
Narrator: But somewhat
counterintuitively,

38:47.967 --> 38:49.632
the lack of seat assignments

38:49.633 --> 38:52.332
leads to the fastest time
so far.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.532
It saves on time,

38:54.533 --> 38:57.966
but, according to
a customer survey score of -5,

38:57.967 --> 38:59.732
not on stress.

38:59.733 --> 39:01.399
Adam:
This is fascinating.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.332
I've just finished scoring the
random-random boarding method,

39:04.333 --> 39:05.966
and they hated this method.

39:05.967 --> 39:08.866
Overwhelmingly,
they voted it as terrible.

39:08.867 --> 39:10.832
And i think
this is an interesting window

39:10.833 --> 39:11.899
into human psychology.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.532
I think humans like structure.

39:14.533 --> 39:16.499
We want to know
that there's a structure,

39:16.500 --> 39:17.599
even if it takes us longer.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.899
It appeals
to our sense of justice

39:19.900 --> 39:22.199
that things are happening
for a reason.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.532
It's fascinating.

39:23.533 --> 39:25.699
Narrator: Which leaves
the results looking like this.

39:25.700 --> 39:29.066
Despite surveys indicating
that waiting and queuing

39:29.067 --> 39:32.299
is the single-biggest complaint
for frequent fliers,

39:32.300 --> 39:36.332
it seems a sense of order and
structure is just as important,

39:36.333 --> 39:39.766
which leaves one final attempt
by the team

39:39.767 --> 39:41.866
to find
the perfect boarding solution...

39:41.867 --> 39:45.966
One that might provide speed,
structure, and satisfaction.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.599
Next up is a method
called the reverse pyramid.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.899
It's pretty complex.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.666
In fact, the passengers are told
merely to board by zones,

39:52.667 --> 39:54.732
which are pre-sorted
on their tickets.

39:54.733 --> 39:56.299
The best way
to explain it to you guys

39:56.300 --> 39:57.566
is with the editors' help.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.266
Editors, if you'd put up
a graphic, please,

39:59.267 --> 40:00.766
and show the zones
as they board.

40:00.767 --> 40:05.632
One, two, three, four,
five, and six.

40:05.633 --> 40:08.632
It's pretty complicated.
It's supposed to be pretty fast.

40:08.633 --> 40:09.832
We're gonna find out.

40:09.833 --> 40:11.466
Narrator:
It appears complicated,

40:11.467 --> 40:14.632
but with zones and seat numbers
printed on the tickets,

40:14.633 --> 40:16.599
it's actually incredibly simple.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.399
Adam: If you have "group two"
on your ticket,

40:18.400 --> 40:19.499
you may board the airplane.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.999
Jamie: This one
appears to be working

40:21.000 --> 40:23.199
kind of like
the Wilma techniques,

40:23.200 --> 40:24.732
where it's filling
on the outside

40:24.733 --> 40:27.799
and then gradually works its way
towards the middle.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.266
Group three
may now board the airplane.

40:30.267 --> 40:34.532
Jamie: But the pyramid strategy
ends up doing that in blocks,

40:34.533 --> 40:37.366
which may or may not help it.

40:37.367 --> 40:39.932
Narrator: And when the timer
stops at 15:10,

40:39.933 --> 40:42.832
it's back to the shop
on an imaginary flight

40:42.833 --> 40:45.532
to make their final assessment.

40:45.533 --> 40:46.932
Buckle in.
Okay.

40:46.933 --> 40:49.533
[ Sighs ]

40:50.967 --> 40:53.166
Here we go.
Three, two, one.

40:53.167 --> 40:55.466
Shoooom!

40:55.467 --> 40:56.732
So, where do we stand?

40:56.733 --> 40:58.699
Well, the myth was
that the most common technique

40:58.700 --> 41:00.566
that airlines use
for boarding a plane,

41:00.567 --> 41:02.099
that is, from back to front,

41:02.100 --> 41:05.399
also happened to be the slowest
and least-efficient method

41:05.400 --> 41:06.799
of putting people
onto an airplane.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.166
And based on our testing,

41:08.167 --> 41:09.832
i have to say
it's myth confirmed.

41:09.833 --> 41:10.833
Indeed.

41:10.834 --> 41:13.132
But you know
what's interesting is

41:13.133 --> 41:15.232
that the fastest technique
we tried

41:15.233 --> 41:17.232
was also the least popular.

41:17.233 --> 41:19.232
That might be why
most airlines don't use it.

41:19.233 --> 41:20.632
Well, the good news is

41:20.633 --> 41:22.466
that the three most-popular
techniques we tried

41:22.467 --> 41:26.066
are significantly faster than
the back-to-front technique,

41:26.067 --> 41:28.566
so those are the ones
we should be using.

41:28.567 --> 41:30.967
Absolutely.
You hear that, airlines?
