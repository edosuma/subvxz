WEBVTT

00:28.385 --> 00:30.592
Sometimes I wonder
what it would be like...

00:32.196 --> 00:35.272
to be like everyone
walking up and down the
street...

00:36.409 --> 00:38.716
living in blissful ignorance...

00:40.788 --> 00:47.174
having friends where memories
instead of secrets linked us
together.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.223
If I had been born to
any other family,

00:53.159 --> 00:55.198
so many things would
be different.

00:57.071 --> 01:01.083
But as my foster mom
used to say,

01:01.150 --> 01:04.827
"If wishes were fishes,
we'd all cast nets."

01:36.221 --> 01:37.224
Give me.

01:37.291 --> 01:39.330
I believe the correct
response is:

01:39.397 --> 01:41.136
I love you so much for getting
me iced coffee,

01:43.109 --> 01:45.918
You know I could totally
just ninja kick your ass and
take the coffee.

01:46.921 --> 01:47.990
But you'd never do such a thing

01:48.057 --> 01:51.266
'cause I'm your best-est
friend-est
in the world-est.

01:51.333 --> 01:55.178
Okay, so, I have a hot date
Saturday night,

01:55.245 --> 01:56.516
Well, hopefully, a hot date,

01:56.583 --> 01:59.792
but David has me on the schedule
to work the Quarter,

01:59.859 --> 02:01.163
so...

02:01.230 --> 02:03.002
You want me to take your shift
in the Quarter?

02:03.069 --> 02:05.008
- Mm-hm.
- On a Saturday?

02:05.075 --> 02:06.411
Smack dab in tourist hell?

02:07.081 --> 02:08.251
Pretty please?

02:09.655 --> 02:10.625
Sure. Not like a I
have a hot date.

02:12.096 --> 02:15.506
I mean you could if you went out
more
than once a year.

02:15.573 --> 02:18.749
I'd totally do you.
You know I swing both ways.

02:18.816 --> 02:20.253
I like boys...

02:20.320 --> 02:22.961
and can we not talk
about them or swinging?

02:23.029 --> 02:27.007
This conversation is gonna lead
me
to dwell on the severe

02:27.074 --> 02:28.679
lack of orgasms in my life.

02:28.745 --> 02:32.958
Fine, I don’t know, I don’t get
why you’re going to college.

02:33.025 --> 02:36.803
I mean, you already have a job
that pays extraordinarily well,

02:36.870 --> 02:40.213
even if it does have the
shortest life span
of any job out there,

02:40.280 --> 02:45.663
but it's just like, another
reason
not to waste your time on...
that.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.772
Okay, how about a
friendly wager?

02:49.608 --> 02:50.845
On?

02:50.912 --> 02:54.155
Most kills by one in
the morning.

02:55.158 --> 02:57.699
Deal, what do I get when I win?

02:57.766 --> 02:58.134
If you win.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.875
I'll bring you iced
coffee for a week,

03:01.611 --> 03:03.382
and if I win...

03:17.491 --> 03:19.029
Fucking fae.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.139
That one's mine.
Thanks for Saturday.

03:22.206 --> 03:24.914
I'll get laid and you can live
vicariously through me.

03:24.980 --> 03:25.950
Peace out.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.583
Your whole world is
about to end.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.072
As last words go, I've
heard better.

04:30.008 --> 04:30.978
I'm sure you have.

04:37.264 --> 04:38.702
Kind of tacky to bring a gun
to a knife fight.

04:39.872 --> 04:41.610
And stupid to let you
walk up behind me

04:41.677 --> 04:44.652
and stab me in the back
like the last one just did.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.224
Good point.

04:47.796 --> 04:48.932
You're not a normal fae.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.673
And you're not a stupid cow.

04:52.443 --> 04:54.783
Oh... Wait. I know what you are.

04:56.321 --> 04:57.291
A dead fae.

05:02.372 --> 05:04.746
How weak do you think I am, cow?

05:29.687 --> 05:31.827
Come on, David, come on.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.444
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message
system.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.052
Someone's triggered the alarm.

05:40.118 --> 05:41.723
Someone's down on the stairs.

05:43.329 --> 05:44.332
She's alive.

05:49.948 --> 05:52.422
And she's staring at me
really intensely.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.033
Who is it?

05:57.203 --> 05:59.310
She kinda looks like
she's from that movie Brave.

06:00.380 --> 06:01.383
The one with the curly,
red hair.

06:02.786 --> 06:05.395
Shit! That'll be Ivy Morgan.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.908
Don't... touch me!

06:13.352 --> 06:15.157
That's not what I usually hear
from the ladies.

06:16.728 --> 06:19.202
- Doc.
- What happened to you, girl?

06:19.269 --> 06:20.473
A fae shot me.

06:21.543 --> 06:24.552
Girl, fae don't use guns.

06:24.619 --> 06:28.196
It was a fae. A fae that didn't
need
glamour to hide its identity.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.235
- What?
- That can't be true.

06:30.302 --> 06:34.080
This fae didn't have silver
skin,
but it had fae eyes.

06:34.715 --> 06:36.488
And it conjured a gun...

06:36.554 --> 06:39.463
- out of thin air.
- I'm thinking you might've hit
your head, girl.

06:39.530 --> 06:43.375
- Let's get you upstairs.
- No, I'm telling you...

06:57.551 --> 06:59.958
I'm assuming this is why
you called me last night?

07:01.830 --> 07:06.143
Would've answered, but...
well, Laurie would be downright
pissed

07:06.210 --> 07:08.182
if I let her hanging if
you get my drift.

07:09.787 --> 07:11.358
I talked to Doc Harris.

07:11.426 --> 07:14.234
He said it was just a flesh
wound
that bled a lot.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.240
Probably made worse by
your running.

07:16.306 --> 07:17.309
I didn't run because
I'm a coward.

07:17.376 --> 07:18.881
I didn't say you are
were coward.

07:18.948 --> 07:20.653
That man had a gun,
you can't fight a bullet.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.194
I'm gonna pull you off rotation
until next Wednesday.

07:23.261 --> 07:24.732
But I'm working for Val
this Saturday.

07:26.403 --> 07:29.914
- I know what you told Harris
and Ren...
- Ren?

07:29.981 --> 07:31.318
Who's Ren?

07:31.385 --> 07:32.221
Ren Owens.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.394
Transferred to our sect
from Colorado.

07:36.668 --> 07:38.239
Are you sure it was a fae, Ivy?

07:40.847 --> 07:43.922
It didn't look like a regular
fae,
but it made a gun appear out of
thin air.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.963
- Possible.
- I know what I saw.

07:46.029 --> 07:47.133
And you know me.

07:47.199 --> 07:49.139
Never once have you ever
had to question me.

07:49.205 --> 07:50.676
Except for the time you
ended up in jail.

07:50.743 --> 07:54.990
Except that one time,
but what I'm telling you is the
truth.

07:55.056 --> 07:57.296
And if hitting a fae with iron
does nothing to them,

07:57.363 --> 07:58.968
then they would be unstoppable.

07:59.035 --> 08:02.444
No. They would be an ancient.

08:10.503 --> 08:11.104
I thought they were all sealed
in the Otherworld.

08:13.077 --> 08:18.226
It's possible that a few
could've remained
here undetected, but it is
highly unlikely.

08:18.627 --> 08:20.165
I saw it.

08:20.232 --> 08:22.304
We don't know what
you really saw.

08:23.675 --> 08:24.578
We don't, Ivy.

08:25.681 --> 08:27.453
I'm gonna contact the
other sects.

08:27.521 --> 08:29.827
See if they have any
experiences like this,

08:29.894 --> 08:31.298
but until I hear back from them,

08:31.365 --> 08:32.468
you need to keep this quiet.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.642
We can't tell anyone.

08:35.711 --> 08:37.116
Not even Val.

08:37.182 --> 08:38.352
Do you understand me?

08:39.289 --> 08:40.458
I understand, David.

08:42.030 --> 08:44.404
Did the fae say anything to you?

08:44.470 --> 08:47.513
Just the same old
"your world is about to end "
crap.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.342
Guess who got shot last night
by some punk?

09:08.409 --> 09:09.813
You must've been off your game.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.357
Yeah. And I have bad news.

09:14.628 --> 09:16.199
Well, worse than getting shot
by some punk?

09:16.934 --> 09:18.774
I can't work Saturday night.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.211
David pulled me.

09:20.278 --> 09:22.819
Honey, that is the last thing
you should be worried about.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.157
Want me to swing by?

09:25.260 --> 09:28.569
Nah, I'm just gonna get
cleaned up and sleep.

09:29.272 --> 09:31.010
Be careful, please.

09:31.077 --> 09:32.548
You promised me that, okay?

09:33.150 --> 09:34.520
I'm always careful.

10:34.065 --> 10:36.774
Bite me and I will bury you
alive
in a shoe box.

10:36.841 --> 10:37.977
Where have you been?

10:38.044 --> 10:40.117
You didn't come home.
I thought you were dead.

10:40.184 --> 10:43.494
No one knows about me,
and I would just be left here,
forgotten.

10:43.561 --> 10:44.731
I'd starve, Ivy, starve.

10:44.798 --> 10:46.436
Doesn't look like you
were starving.

10:46.503 --> 10:48.844
I had to eat to get through the
stress
of being abandoned.

10:48.910 --> 10:49.913
I knew where you were.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.186
And you don't engage
in any bow-chick a-wow-wee.

10:52.254 --> 10:53.724
You always come home.

10:55.764 --> 10:56.466
So...

10:57.134 --> 10:58.305
where were you, Ivy Divy?

10:58.372 --> 10:59.642
I got shot last night.

10:59.709 --> 11:03.287
What? You got shot?
Where? How? By who?

11:03.354 --> 11:07.599
Did you cry? I would've cried.
A lot, like, a river of
motherfucking tears.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.708
- A fae shot me.
- When did they start using
guns?

11:10.776 --> 11:13.484
And the fae didn't have
silver skin either.

11:13.551 --> 11:16.091
And it conjured a gun
out of thin air.

11:16.158 --> 11:20.103
And I stabbed him with an iron
stake
and it did nothing.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.541
- Sound like an...
- Ancient?

11:21.608 --> 11:23.882
Oh, they're badass.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.018
Scary.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.623
I've never seen an ancient here.

11:26.690 --> 11:29.298
Exactly how long have you been
in this world, Tink?

11:29.365 --> 11:32.073
I hate it when you call me Tink,
evil woman.

11:35.884 --> 11:38.124
Well, you won't tell me
your real name.

11:38.191 --> 11:40.030
It's a good thing you hate the
fae
as much as the Order does

11:40.097 --> 11:42.604
or I may not have rescued you
and harbored you.

11:42.671 --> 11:44.644
I've seen the ancients in
the Otherworld.

11:44.710 --> 11:46.181
I've even seen the prince.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.756
He's dreamy, but really scary.

11:48.823 --> 11:50.561
Do you know anything
about the ancients being here?

11:50.829 --> 11:52.334
No.

11:52.401 --> 11:55.242
What about why an ancient
would suddenly make his presence
known?

11:55.309 --> 11:56.078
I have no clue.

11:57.248 --> 12:00.223
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, Tink?

12:00.290 --> 12:02.664
No. You have Amazon Prime.

12:03.701 --> 12:04.972
Good to know
how I can secure your loyalty.

12:06.911 --> 12:09.317
By the way, while you were
passed out,
there were deliveries for you.

12:09.385 --> 12:09.987
I put them on the counter.

12:11.156 --> 12:12.862
Why did you wait until
now to tell me?

12:13.530 --> 12:14.600
But you're okay, right?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.406
You're not gonna die on me
while you sleep?

12:16.473 --> 12:18.880
No one knows about me
so no one will know to come
looking for me.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.286
You know, I already ate the
marshmallows
out of the Lucky Charms.

12:21.353 --> 12:22.524
I'm fine!

13:01.373 --> 13:02.276
Tink, I'm heading out.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.750
You're not going out to work,
are you?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.589
I'm just going out.

13:07.258 --> 13:08.227
I won't be late.

13:08.294 --> 13:09.865
I don't believe you.

13:10.635 --> 13:11.939
You're up to shenanigans.

13:12.006 --> 13:13.610
You want me to bring you back
some beignets?

13:13.677 --> 13:15.048
Would you? For me?

13:15.115 --> 13:16.786
A whole plate for me,
all mine, not yours?

13:17.154 --> 13:18.090
Yes.

13:18.157 --> 13:20.096
Then get the hell out of my face
and get going.

13:22.036 --> 13:23.005
You're welcome.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.831
- Ivy!
- Trent.

13:31.898 --> 13:32.667
Didn't you get shot?

13:33.570 --> 13:36.345
Yeah, but it was just
flesh wound.

13:36.411 --> 13:37.214
Nothing big.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.958
- I'm not working.
- Then why you're here?

13:42.296 --> 13:43.166
Why are you here?

13:43.867 --> 13:44.803
I wanted to see the score.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.916
I caught of couple of fae coming
out of this bar over the last
week.

13:48.982 --> 13:49.985
I wanted to check it out.

13:50.053 --> 13:51.925
I saw fae out here last night.

13:53.062 --> 13:54.800
Thought you said you
weren't working.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.308
Just because I'm checking
something out
doesn't mean I'm working.

13:57.374 --> 13:59.013
Heard you said a fae shot you?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.283
This wasn't a normal fae, Trent.

14:01.554 --> 14:04.028
I stabbed him with iron and
it did nothing.

14:04.797 --> 14:07.003
That sounds batshit crazy.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.510
Like as crazy as Merle sounds.

14:09.578 --> 14:12.386
Merle was a member of the Order
and you should respect
everything

14:12.453 --> 14:14.024
that woman has sacrificed.

14:14.092 --> 14:16.833
I knew it was a bad idea
when the Order started allowing
females in.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.003
You just can't handle...

14:18.639 --> 14:21.079
Handle that, asshole.

14:37.596 --> 14:38.765
I wouldn't do that!

14:39.500 --> 14:39.969
I'm gonna put you down.

14:41.206 --> 14:42.978
And you're not gonna punch me
or kick me.

14:43.044 --> 14:44.950
Nod your head if you feel me.

14:50.935 --> 14:52.907
I'm sorry for snatching you
off the street, Merida,

14:52.974 --> 14:54.479
but you were about to make
another big mistake

14:54.545 --> 14:55.916
like the one you got you shot.

14:55.983 --> 14:58.089
I didn't make a mistake last
night,
I was doing my job.

14:58.157 --> 14:59.862
The moment you thought
you could engage that fae

14:59.928 --> 15:01.701
you made a mistake.

15:01.768 --> 15:02.937
And you're about to do it again.

15:03.004 --> 15:04.910
I just saved your life,
sweetness.

15:06.716 --> 15:10.059
Wow, you're so
incredibly modest.

15:10.795 --> 15:12.166
Can I make you some cookies?

15:12.232 --> 15:14.138
And you're a one bundle
of kickass hotness.

15:15.408 --> 15:18.551
But you're not ready
to face off with an ancient,
Ivy.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.967
What makes you say
that's an ancient?

15:24.034 --> 15:26.006
- David said...
- Let me guess.

15:26.073 --> 15:28.481
David said it was
highly unlikely.

15:28.547 --> 15:29.985
None have been seen in decades.

15:34.465 --> 15:35.736
Go home.

15:35.803 --> 15:38.879
Otherwise I'm gonna tell David
you were out hunting.

15:39.882 --> 15:40.383
You're a dick.

15:41.620 --> 15:43.426
- Where are you going?
- Get some beignets.

15:48.942 --> 15:51.048
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:55.127 --> 15:56.298
You look like crap.

15:56.364 --> 15:59.072
Thanks. I feel even better now.

15:59.139 --> 16:00.109
Seriously, are you feeling well?

16:01.379 --> 16:03.118
I think I might've had
a stomach bug yesterday.

16:03.184 --> 16:03.887
Do you need anything?

16:04.990 --> 16:07.498
I can make a mean bowl
of chicken noodle soup.

16:07.564 --> 16:08.935
Straight out of the can.

16:12.111 --> 16:12.446
- Hi!
- Jo Ann!

16:13.282 --> 16:15.187
You seriously need to
talk to him.

16:15.255 --> 16:18.564
I can't. You just saw that.
It happens every time I try to
talk to them.

16:18.631 --> 16:19.400
I sound like Beaker.

16:20.805 --> 16:23.077
Oh, my God, you totally did
just sound like Beaker.

16:26.555 --> 16:27.524
We'll be late for class.

16:34.746 --> 16:35.983
Hey, Jerome.

16:51.028 --> 16:51.296
Look. It's the crazy bitch.

16:52.131 --> 16:54.170
I'm surprised you're
walking today.

16:54.237 --> 16:58.049
I'm surprised they still allowed
in the Order
after you spotted that crazy
shit.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.222
Everything okay, Ivy?

17:03.833 --> 17:05.203
Everything is peachy.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.009
Doesn't seem like it.

17:16.771 --> 17:17.307
It's nothing.

17:18.544 --> 17:19.279
Sounds like it might be
more than nothing.

17:21.018 --> 17:23.359
Especially since Trent was just
talking about
what you said you saw.

17:24.428 --> 17:25.798
David and most of the Order
were listening.

17:27.537 --> 17:30.212
I don't think you should speak
so openly about what you saw.

17:30.647 --> 17:31.449
Thanks.

17:31.516 --> 17:32.452
But I didn't ask for
your opinion.

17:33.689 --> 17:34.525
You don't need to be at
this meeting, Ivy.

17:36.063 --> 17:39.239
I told you to keep your mouth
shut,
you did not do that.

17:39.306 --> 17:40.677
I only said something
because Trent...

17:40.743 --> 17:41.111
I didn't ask for an excuse.

17:42.950 --> 17:44.789
You know he's full of shit half
of the time.
You should've left it at that.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.397
Seems like that issue
is with Trent and not Ivy.

17:47.464 --> 17:49.102
I didn't ask for your opinion.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.108
Half of the Order thinks
Ivy got a screw loose.

17:51.175 --> 17:52.813
The other half thinks we got
a fucking ancient running
around.

17:54.819 --> 17:58.296
Trent wouldn't have said shit
if Ivy hadn't bruised his balls
literally.

17:58.363 --> 17:59.800
He wanted to file a
complaint against you.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.108
You're damn lucky I
hate paperwork

18:02.174 --> 18:03.679
and already had to file one
on your ass this week.

18:03.746 --> 18:07.123
Because I got shot since maybe
we do have
an ancient on the streets.

18:08.494 --> 18:11.803
You, on the other hand,
do need to get your ass over
there.

18:12.940 --> 18:14.412
The other sect members
need to know you

18:14.478 --> 18:16.518
so they don't end up
accidently trying to kill you.

18:16.584 --> 18:18.490
I know I pulled you
off rotation,

18:18.557 --> 18:19.159
but I can't spare anyone else.

18:20.563 --> 18:22.836
So I'm gonna have to have you
show him around town.

18:22.904 --> 18:25.845
You won't be hunting.
If you do happen to cross a fae,

18:25.913 --> 18:29.457
he will handle it.
You don't have a say in this,
Ivy.

18:30.325 --> 18:31.696
You let that sink in
for a second

18:31.763 --> 18:33.802
before you continue
with whatever you're about to
say.

18:33.869 --> 18:34.805
- Got it.
- Good.

18:35.875 --> 18:36.811
Meet me back here
tomorrow at five.

18:37.748 --> 18:38.917
You no longer need him now.

18:49.550 --> 18:51.689
You were shot by an ancient?
Thought it was a thug.

18:53.294 --> 18:55.902
You need to call me girl,
bc every1 is saying cray cray
shit.

18:58.276 --> 19:01.886
DON'T FEED THE TROLLS!

19:13.555 --> 19:15.661
Stop leaving these things
around the house.

19:15.728 --> 19:16.999
It's weird.

19:17.066 --> 19:17.534
I did no such thing.

19:19.005 --> 19:22.081
I told you what they do.
They come alive when I'm
sleeping.

19:22.147 --> 19:23.317
It's not my fault.

19:25.090 --> 19:26.794
How was your day, honey?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.172
Not the greatest.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.211
You wanna tell Dr. Tink
all about it?

19:32.278 --> 19:34.350
I thought you didn't like
to be called Tink.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.290
Don't question my
inconsistencies.

19:36.356 --> 19:37.761
I don't wanna talk about it.

19:38.129 --> 19:39.098
But...

19:40.870 --> 19:42.107
I have pralines.

19:52.271 --> 19:53.407
You do this a lot?

19:53.474 --> 19:55.447
This "stare at me and not speak"
kind of thing?

19:58.857 --> 19:59.827
Oh.

20:03.739 --> 20:05.645
If you don't let me go, I
swear to God...

20:05.711 --> 20:08.486
I didn't come here to fight you.
I need to talk to you.

20:08.552 --> 20:10.492
You could've tried it,
I don't know... calling me.

20:10.558 --> 20:12.732
I did. You didn't answer.

20:16.343 --> 20:17.313
How'd you get in here?

20:17.379 --> 20:18.449
Your windows were unlocked,

20:18.516 --> 20:21.124
which I discovered
after scaling the vines.

20:21.191 --> 20:23.999
You broke into my place
and watched me sleep?

20:24.066 --> 20:25.738
That's got creep factor
written all over you.

20:30.218 --> 20:32.056
Are you... talking to someone?

20:36.068 --> 20:37.339
You really are Merida.

20:37.406 --> 20:39.412
Who in hell is this Merida?

20:39.479 --> 20:41.083
The chick from the movie Brave.

20:41.151 --> 20:42.756
Frizzy red hair. Got it.

20:42.822 --> 20:44.127
I'm seriously gonna stab you.

20:44.193 --> 20:45.831
She could kick ass. She was hot.

20:45.898 --> 20:47.536
This conversation is
taking a weird turn.

20:47.603 --> 20:50.145
And if you slide an inch or so
down,
things are gonna get real
awkward.

20:52.284 --> 20:53.722
Why do you need to talk to me?

20:55.593 --> 20:56.062
I know you're pissed.

20:57.232 --> 20:57.934
You made me look like a
fool to David.

20:59.539 --> 21:02.046
I told you David wouldn't think
that there was an ancient here.

21:02.113 --> 21:04.187
I know you don't have a reason
to trust me, Ivy, but...

21:05.089 --> 21:06.593
you should.

21:12.277 --> 21:13.247
See something you like?

21:14.417 --> 21:16.323
I bet your boyfriend is
one happy man.

21:16.390 --> 21:17.794
My boyfriend's dead.

21:19.064 --> 21:20.000
I'm sorry.

21:20.669 --> 21:22.073
Was he part of the Order?

21:23.210 --> 21:24.146
But I doubt that's relevant
to why you're here.

21:25.650 --> 21:29.295
I'm here because I know
there are ancients in New
Orleans.

21:29.362 --> 21:30.365
I'm hunting them.

21:32.136 --> 21:35.714
I'm part of a secret
organization
within the Order that hunts
them.

21:35.781 --> 21:37.653
David doesn't even
know about us.

21:38.656 --> 21:41.231
Look, I'm starving.

21:41.298 --> 21:44.207
Can you grab something to eat
with me?
I'll explain everything,

21:44.273 --> 21:46.848
and you can tell me exactly
what happened the other night.

21:57.914 --> 21:59.786
Do you want some extra coffee
with your sugar?

22:01.591 --> 22:02.862
I like things sweet.

22:17.138 --> 22:20.415
Well, secret organization
within the Order.

22:24.928 --> 22:27.837
The only reason I'm telling you
is because, well,

22:27.904 --> 22:30.177
we're sorta stuck together
the next couple of days,

22:30.244 --> 22:32.919
and I can't afford to waste time
by keeping you in the dark.

22:34.155 --> 22:36.329
Gee, thanks.

22:36.998 --> 22:39.405
I belong to the Elite.

22:39.472 --> 22:40.207
Never heard of it.

22:41.478 --> 22:42.314
It's existed since the beginning
of the Order.

22:43.684 --> 22:45.858
Just like the Order,
the members are generational,

22:45.925 --> 22:47.629
runs in the family.

22:47.696 --> 22:51.073
We hunt fae like everyone else,
but we're trained to handle the
ancients.

22:52.009 --> 22:54.249
Did you manage to stab
that ancient?

22:54.317 --> 22:55.353
I did.

22:56.356 --> 22:57.426
But it didn't do
anything to him.

22:57.492 --> 22:59.432
It just pulled the stake out
and tossed it aside.

23:01.036 --> 23:04.347
If people in the Order, people
like you,
know about the ancients,

23:04.413 --> 23:05.516
why isn't it common knowledge?

23:06.386 --> 23:07.890
Not knowing is dangerous.

23:09.495 --> 23:10.765
The ancients are rare.

23:11.668 --> 23:13.807
They don't usually
engage the Order.

23:14.710 --> 23:15.914
But how do you kill them?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.039
Thank you.

23:28.852 --> 23:30.591
There's only on thing that
will kill them.

23:31.962 --> 23:33.935
A stake fashioned from a
thorn birch tree

23:34.002 --> 23:35.305
that grows in the Otherworld.

23:36.509 --> 23:38.950
Yeah, so you can imagine
getting that shit isn't easy.

23:40.621 --> 23:42.326
I have one.

23:43.062 --> 23:44.366
That ancient conjured a gun.

23:44.433 --> 23:47.274
As long as they touch something,
they can conjure.

23:48.479 --> 23:48.879
They are powerful, Ivy.

23:50.485 --> 23:53.226
You're damn lucky you got away
from them
with just a flesh wound.

23:54.897 --> 23:57.506
The fact this one was out on the
street
and hunted you down means
something.

23:58.776 --> 24:01.383
We've lost three skilled
Order members since May.

24:04.894 --> 24:06.666
We've been tracking
movement of the fae,

24:06.733 --> 24:08.605
at least a hundred have
ended up here.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.463
There's a gateway to the
Otherworld
in New Orleans.

24:17.466 --> 24:17.933
How do you know that?

24:18.902 --> 24:20.273
The Elite knows cities
the gates are in,

24:21.778 --> 24:24.219
but we don't know the exact
location
or who guards them.

24:25.222 --> 24:27.061
You don't happen to guard
a gate, do you?

24:28.532 --> 24:31.039
'Cause that would make
my job so much easier.

24:38.161 --> 24:40.200
Do you ever wonder what it would
be like
to be one of them?

24:40.668 --> 24:41.638
No.

24:43.009 --> 24:44.179
They're lucky.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.254
We never had a chance.

24:47.321 --> 24:49.127
We were born into this.

24:53.005 --> 24:54.543
You know what's coming up,
right?

24:54.610 --> 24:55.646
The fall equinox.

24:56.783 --> 24:59.224
The gates are always weaker
during the equinox.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.561
The fae, the ancients
coming here,

25:00.628 --> 25:02.433
they could be gearing up
for something to do with it.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.172
Do you believe me now?

25:04.940 --> 25:07.047
I might believe you,

25:07.114 --> 25:09.087
but that doesn't mean
you can steal my bacon.

25:11.861 --> 25:13.299
I wanna show you something.

25:16.876 --> 25:18.347
What are you trying to show me?

25:20.253 --> 25:21.558
If you don't let me go,
so help me God...

25:21.624 --> 25:24.299
You're so full of threats.

25:24.365 --> 25:25.536
Look...

25:25.603 --> 25:26.573
Watch that car.

25:30.317 --> 25:32.624
That better Theo James
or Jensen Ackles getting out.

25:54.489 --> 25:56.495
- Don't.
- We have to do something, Ren.

25:58.066 --> 26:00.775
I know how hard it is to stand
here
and let that happen,

26:02.981 --> 26:05.522
He'll put you down and glamour
everyone
into thinking someone else
killed you.

26:05.588 --> 26:08.999
- Who's this guy?
- I cannot stress enough

26:09.066 --> 26:12.610
how dangerous ancients are
and you're not ready to fight
one.

26:13.512 --> 26:15.218
How did you know he
would be here?

26:17.056 --> 26:17.491
I've been in town for
about a week.

26:19.665 --> 26:23.209
And before that suspicious look
on your face
grows into a "lets-stab Ren"
look,

26:23.275 --> 26:27.321
I checked in with David the
moment
my fine ass stepped foot in this
city.

26:28.457 --> 26:30.630
I found that bastard last night,
did some research.

26:32.001 --> 26:35.445
He's registered in this hotel
as a Marlon St. Cyres.

26:36.148 --> 26:36.649
Wait... that name.

26:37.919 --> 26:39.792
He's some kind of
huge developer in the city.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.931
Yeah, he is.

26:41.998 --> 26:43.302
Holy shit.

26:45.040 --> 26:49.320
The fae masquerade as humans all
the time,
but never in such a public
position?

26:49.387 --> 26:52.764
They fae don't age so existing
in the public eye is risky for
them.

26:53.299 --> 26:54.469
What the hell?

26:55.238 --> 26:56.608
You look like you could use one.

26:56.676 --> 26:58.314
I look like I could use
a kiss on the cheek?

26:59.785 --> 27:00.721
You are bizarre.

27:01.891 --> 27:03.295
I think you kinda like
my bizarreness.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.225
You know I kill fae
for a living.

27:13.994 --> 27:15.331
You didn't have to walk me home.

27:15.933 --> 27:17.271
Call me chivalrous.

28:37.912 --> 28:40.353
I was wondering
if you were gonna show up.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.823
Not sure what I'm
supposed to do with you

28:41.891 --> 28:43.227
since you already know
your way around the city.

28:43.294 --> 28:45.768
I'm sure there are places
you can show me.

28:51.753 --> 28:53.525
You don't get out much, do you?

29:03.287 --> 29:04.792
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

29:28.464 --> 29:29.500
What in the hell?

29:29.567 --> 29:31.105
She took a bite out of that guy.

29:32.576 --> 29:35.685
She was fae food,
that's why she went nuts.

29:35.752 --> 29:37.591
She'll be dead by midnight.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.189
You got this?

29:50.061 --> 29:52.334
Hey, don't forget, we
need to talk.

29:53.004 --> 29:53.973
Yeah.

30:10.790 --> 30:12.094
It doesn't get any easier...

30:21.890 --> 30:23.294
Oh, my God,
I almost got taken out by a
moped.

30:24.965 --> 30:27.674
Good thing you have me around
saving you from crazy moped
drivers.

30:30.716 --> 30:32.388
- Ivy?
- Yeah?

30:34.360 --> 30:36.801
I mean, you don't have to,
but if you keep tugging it like
that,

30:36.868 --> 30:38.206
I'm gonna get all
kinds of ideas.

30:43.956 --> 30:46.898
We should probably clear the
area,
there'll be cops.

30:48.871 --> 30:50.041
Do you have a girlfriend?

30:59.904 --> 31:02.077
Hey! You're back,
and you didn't get shot.

31:02.144 --> 31:03.916
- You weren't shot again, right?
- Nope.

31:03.982 --> 31:05.821
You know what I've
been thinking?

31:05.888 --> 31:09.031
That guy that was in here last
night?
I think you wanna get it on with
him.

31:09.332 --> 31:10.736
What?

31:10.803 --> 31:12.006
You left the house with him
after he obviously broke in.

31:13.679 --> 31:17.523
I'm telling you what, you
females are freaks.
Females of my kind?

31:17.591 --> 31:21.301
If you broke in, they'd eat you
for dinner.
And not in the fun way.

31:21.368 --> 31:23.742
Firstly, I don't think breaking
into someone's apartment

31:23.809 --> 31:27.018
is something to swoon about.
And secondly, Ren didn't break
in

31:27.086 --> 31:29.425
because someone left
the window unlocked.

31:29.492 --> 31:30.863
I did no such thing.

31:32.066 --> 31:34.474
Okay, I might've done that,
but he climbed a a wall

31:34.540 --> 31:38.152
and that's kind of...
Actually, that's kind of
impressive.

31:38.219 --> 31:40.325
I bet that means
he could pick you up and...

31:40.392 --> 31:43.200
Oh ,my God, Tink, really?

31:43.267 --> 31:46.109
He's a member of the Order
and I'm not talking about sex
with you.

31:46.611 --> 31:48.182
Sex is good.

31:48.249 --> 31:49.252
Shut up, Tink.

31:49.319 --> 31:50.155
Sex is fun.

31:50.221 --> 31:52.127
Sex is best when
it's one on one!

31:53.665 --> 31:55.069
Isn't that a George
Michael song?

31:55.136 --> 31:57.844
Maybe. But he was wrong.
I like to think sex is best

31:57.911 --> 32:00.853
when it's three on three or
something.
Seems more adventurous.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.090
Good night, Tink!

32:16.868 --> 32:18.038
Hey!

32:19.575 --> 32:23.922
Hey! You got me worried, Ivy.
People are talking...

32:23.989 --> 32:25.527
And they're saying I'm crazy.

32:26.663 --> 32:29.172
Trent said you told David
that it was an ancient?

32:29.238 --> 32:30.442
And he's not the only one.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.125
I saw another ancient
in the Warehouse District.

32:36.193 --> 32:38.064
Marlon St. Cyers,
a huge developer.

32:39.067 --> 32:41.006
Fae don't make themselves
public like that.

32:42.110 --> 32:43.581
Okay, so, I mean,
why do you think they're here?

32:44.985 --> 32:47.292
I think they may be planning
something with the gates.

32:48.027 --> 32:50.000
I don't know what, but I...

32:51.371 --> 32:52.039
What?

32:53.277 --> 32:55.951
What I'm about to tell you
can't go any further, okay?

32:56.018 --> 32:58.158
Honey, I am a vault of secrets.

33:00.766 --> 33:03.674
Ren knows about the ancients.
He's part of the Elite.

33:04.745 --> 33:06.984
What in the fuckity fuck
is the Elite?

33:07.051 --> 33:09.090
A secret branch in the Order
that fights the ancients.

33:10.027 --> 33:11.498
That's why he's here
in New Orleans.

33:12.802 --> 33:14.273
Okay, so what's the plan?

33:15.343 --> 33:17.114
I was thinking about
seeing Merle today.

33:17.181 --> 33:18.652
If anyone knows about the gates,
it's her.

33:21.026 --> 33:25.005
The last time you visited Merle
with me,
she called you a harlot and the
slut of Satan.

33:25.573 --> 33:27.546
The slut of Satan?

33:29.117 --> 33:30.388
That's actually an
impressive title.

33:31.525 --> 33:34.199
All right, fine, so is Renny boy
going with you?

33:35.370 --> 33:37.376
No. I haven't told him
about her yet.

33:38.980 --> 33:41.521
My momma always used to talk
about the ancients all the time.

33:41.588 --> 33:44.497
She said that they ran the
courts
in the Otherworld.

33:44.564 --> 33:48.241
She said there was a prince,
a princess, a king and queen,

33:48.309 --> 33:50.381
and that they
controlled the knights.

33:50.448 --> 33:54.527
What if the ancients here
wanna open the gates for them?

33:56.700 --> 33:58.238
That would be very bad.

33:59.508 --> 34:00.478
Yeah.

34:38.358 --> 34:39.896
Hi, you've reached Brighton,
leave a message.

34:39.963 --> 34:44.342
Hey Brighton, it's Ivy. I'm here
at your
place looking for your mom.

34:44.410 --> 34:46.716
Give me a call back
when you get this. Thanks.

35:00.758 --> 35:02.329
- For you.
- Why?

35:02.396 --> 35:04.002
I saw this on my way here
and thought of you.

35:06.776 --> 35:09.418
This is the part where you take
the rose from me.

35:11.156 --> 35:12.561
Thanks.

35:15.368 --> 35:16.539
What did you do today?

35:18.980 --> 35:19.882
It's just a simple question.

35:21.053 --> 35:23.059
I bought beignets
and staked out the hotel

35:23.126 --> 35:24.395
we'd seen the ancient go into.

35:27.138 --> 35:28.943
What do you carry around
in that bag pack?

35:29.010 --> 35:30.815
Textbooks. Notebooks.

35:30.882 --> 35:31.952
Textbooks?

35:33.222 --> 35:34.527
I'm going to college.
Majoring in Sociology.

35:36.031 --> 35:38.705
You do that and this?
Do you plan on leaving the
Order?

35:40.343 --> 35:42.349
I'm pretty sure the only way
you leave the Order is in a body
bag.

35:43.386 --> 35:44.924
People have left the Order, Ivy.

35:46.161 --> 35:47.766
I don't wanna leave,
I just wanna do more.

35:48.502 --> 35:49.905
I wanna be a social worker.

35:51.744 --> 35:53.884
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like you.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.055
Ivy!

35:56.124 --> 35:57.596
Is that how you talk to a lady?

35:57.662 --> 35:59.167
Who in the hell do you
think you are?

35:59.234 --> 36:01.608
It's okay. He's a
jerk to everyone.

36:02.109 --> 36:03.112
Not everyone.

36:03.179 --> 36:03.614
Your dog doesn't count.

36:04.984 --> 36:07.592
You owe me. This is the first
time
you've forgotten.

36:09.197 --> 36:10.333
Forgot what?

36:10.701 --> 36:11.604
Cake.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.075
The best damn chocolate cake
I've ever had.

36:14.245 --> 36:15.950
That girl brings it to me
every Monday.

36:16.018 --> 36:18.525
I'm sorry.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Okay?

36:19.027 --> 36:19.995
You'd better.

36:25.145 --> 36:26.916
And why haven't I
been offered any?

36:26.983 --> 36:29.390
You're gonna have to get to know
me better
before you taste my cake.

36:30.260 --> 36:31.864
Was that an invitation?

36:31.931 --> 36:33.737
That's not what I meant!

36:36.311 --> 36:37.549
We got work to do, come on.

36:51.624 --> 36:53.061
You expect me to get on that?

36:53.630 --> 36:54.900
That is a Ducati.

37:00.618 --> 37:04.529
Look, I got a job to do
that doesn't include tracking
normal fae.

37:08.441 --> 37:09.778
I don't think I like you.

37:11.216 --> 37:12.419
I bet your taste is as sweet

37:12.486 --> 37:14.693
as one of those beignets
you've got me addicted to.

37:15.763 --> 37:18.939
But you got one hell of a kick.
You like me.

37:19.006 --> 37:20.978
You're just not ready
to admit it yet.

37:28.267 --> 37:29.237
You're coming or not?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.191
You're gonna have to hold on,
sweetness.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.089
I've been keeping an eye
on our friend.

37:58.156 --> 38:00.330
At night he leaves the hotel
and goes to this club.

38:04.442 --> 38:05.512
Ever been in there?

38:05.578 --> 38:05.846
I don't go to a lot of clubs.

38:07.584 --> 38:11.764
I did the partying thing before
I turned 21,
drove my parents crazy.

38:12.433 --> 38:13.602
Your parents still alive?

38:14.070 --> 38:14.907
Yeah. Yours?

38:15.943 --> 38:17.581
My real parents died
when I was just a baby

38:17.648 --> 38:22.629
and my adopted parents...
they're gone, too.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.277
That's him. The fae who shot me.

38:33.529 --> 38:35.235
You think that alley runs
behind the club?

38:36.003 --> 38:37.307
Only one way to find out...

38:51.550 --> 38:53.757
Stay back.
You're not supposed to hunt.

38:55.461 --> 38:56.431
Hey.

38:58.236 --> 39:00.410
The Order.
Must be getting desperate.

39:06.227 --> 39:08.199
Take him out,
we don't have time for this.

39:21.506 --> 39:22.676
Really?

39:42.904 --> 39:45.110
Well... that was fun.

39:45.177 --> 39:46.849
I thought I told you
to stay back!

39:46.916 --> 39:49.322
I wanted to keep at least one of
them alive
to, you know, question it.

39:50.493 --> 39:52.532
I saw that. You flinched.
Let me see, Ivy.

39:52.599 --> 39:54.538
I'm fine. Jesus.

39:54.605 --> 39:57.246
How would you like it if I ran
around
pulling your shirt up?

39:57.313 --> 39:58.350
I'd fucking love it.

40:07.310 --> 40:08.279
Oh, no.

40:13.127 --> 40:14.966
- Do you see Val?
- No.

40:18.242 --> 40:19.212
Hey.

40:24.495 --> 40:25.364
We lost Trent tonight.

40:26.468 --> 40:29.810
He was found just outside
of St. Louis Cemetery.

40:29.877 --> 40:33.455
His neck... was broken.

40:34.625 --> 40:35.762
Amongst other things.

40:35.828 --> 40:36.397
He was tortured.

40:37.567 --> 40:39.005
He's the fourth to die
in five months.

40:39.673 --> 40:40.476
Were the others tortured?

40:40.743 --> 40:42.449
No.

40:42.516 --> 40:48.166
From now until further notice,
you all will be working in
groups of two.

40:49.537 --> 40:50.506
No one hunts alone.

40:52.011 --> 40:53.682
Stay safe out there.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.290
Ivy.

41:01.305 --> 41:02.642
Where were you tonight?

41:02.709 --> 41:04.682
- I was out with Ren.
- Where?

41:04.748 --> 41:06.186
We started out by Jackson Square

41:06.253 --> 41:07.457
and then headed down
to the Business District.

41:08.292 --> 41:10.065
We ran into three fae.

41:10.132 --> 41:13.307
So you weren't in the Quarter
tonight
except for the beginning of your
shift?

41:13.374 --> 41:16.484
No. Why are you asking me this?

41:16.551 --> 41:17.621
Just checking.

41:18.590 --> 41:19.560
That's all.

41:26.881 --> 41:28.219
I gotta go too.

41:31.428 --> 41:32.732
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

41:37.614 --> 41:38.416
You and Val are close?

41:39.854 --> 41:41.491
She's the first person I made
when I moved down here.

41:43.064 --> 41:45.805
Every one of those members
killed
could've been guards of the
gate.

41:46.774 --> 41:48.647
They were all highly skilled.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.956
If the fae knew to target them
then that means someone within
the Order

41:52.024 --> 41:53.194
could be assisting the fae.

41:56.103 --> 41:59.078
How is your stomach?
No bullshit.

42:00.348 --> 42:02.388
It's a little tender,
but it's not a big deal.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.698
How are you... up here?

42:08.506 --> 42:10.947
Trent wasn't always easy
to get along with,

42:11.013 --> 42:12.251
but I'd never wish him dead.

42:13.822 --> 42:16.330
You think David knows
more than what he's putting out
there?

42:17.132 --> 42:18.469
Everything has to be connected.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.511
The fae migrating here,
club FLUX.

42:21.579 --> 42:23.785
Something's going down.
We need to get in there.

42:29.903 --> 42:32.544
Hi, Ivy. It's Brighton.
I got your message.

42:32.612 --> 42:33.381
I can't believe
what happened to Trent.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.924
We're in Texas now,
but we'll be home tomorrow.

42:36.991 --> 42:38.329
And please be careful!

42:42.441 --> 42:43.511
You look like you're going out
trolling for sex.

42:45.216 --> 42:48.426
Like the dirty, nasty kind that
ends up
with a wide array of STDs.

42:49.061 --> 42:49.830
Thanks for the input.

42:50.766 --> 42:51.168
Are you sure this is smart?

42:52.772 --> 42:54.510
If there are ancients there,
Ivy,
you shouldn't be near them.

42:56.985 --> 42:58.957
It's the best chance we have
of finding out what they're up
to.

43:00.629 --> 43:02.134
Ren's here and he can't see you.

43:02.201 --> 43:02.736
I'm not afraid of him.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.176
I didn't say you were
afraid of him.

43:06.613 --> 43:07.717
Behave.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.555
Don't I always?

43:19.720 --> 43:20.588
This is wrong.

43:21.893 --> 43:24.968
It's the only dress I could
wear.
Val made me get it,

43:25.035 --> 43:26.540
I've never worn it before.

43:26.606 --> 43:27.543
Oh, sweetness.

43:29.282 --> 43:30.986
You did wrong in all
the right ways.

43:32.156 --> 43:33.862
How in the world
am I gonna pay attention

43:33.929 --> 43:34.898
when you look like that?

43:38.275 --> 43:39.780
You are absolutely beautiful,
Ivy.

43:43.959 --> 43:45.028
What was that?

43:45.095 --> 43:45.630
I... I have a cat.

43:46.768 --> 43:48.138
It probably knocked
something over.

43:48.205 --> 43:49.777
It's old, and annoying.
Gonna die soon.

43:49.843 --> 43:50.946
We should get going.

44:05.323 --> 44:06.493
You are carrying, right?

44:08.466 --> 44:10.305
Damn. That's what
fantasies are made of.

44:12.210 --> 44:13.380
You ready?

44:14.149 --> 44:15.320
Are you?

44:48.552 --> 44:49.890
You're seeing what I'm seeing?

44:51.561 --> 44:53.767
I've never seen so many humans
and fae together.

44:57.245 --> 44:58.415
Shit!

45:04.266 --> 45:05.370
What are you doing?

45:07.174 --> 45:08.612
He's by the dance floor.

45:10.385 --> 45:12.791
What do we do now
since this was your genius idea?

45:13.360 --> 45:14.195
We just blend in.

45:14.262 --> 45:15.667
Blending in means having sex,

45:15.733 --> 45:18.274
or haven't you noticed
that's what's happening around
us?

45:18.342 --> 45:21.050
Oh, I've noticed. Dance, Ivy.

45:27.569 --> 45:29.977
You're doing good,
but I know you can do better.

45:31.581 --> 45:32.952
Try to keep an eye on
the ancient.

46:25.443 --> 46:29.287
Careful. I know damn well
he hasn't forgotten that face of
yours.

46:59.512 --> 47:04.894
Tell me yes... and I'll do
anything...
anything you want.

47:09.675 --> 47:11.714
Marlon is here.
We need to get up there.

47:12.316 --> 47:14.055
It's too dangerous.

47:14.122 --> 47:16.763
If he suspects you're with the
Order,
I won't be able to get to you in
time.

47:17.532 --> 47:19.270
I don't need your permission.

47:20.373 --> 47:21.410
Oh, I know what you need.

47:27.863 --> 47:30.370
That's good.
How many will that make, Roman?

47:31.340 --> 47:33.011
Five, once it's carried out...

47:33.079 --> 47:36.221
We don't have much more time.
We cannot let him down.

47:36.288 --> 47:40.601
We know the location,
the bastard broke.

47:40.668 --> 47:42.273
We will not fail this time.

47:51.166 --> 47:53.205
Little one, you look a bit lost.

47:54.342 --> 47:56.013
I was just looking for
the restroom.

47:56.616 --> 47:57.719
Do you know where it is?

47:57.786 --> 48:01.396
This is not the restroom.
What is your name?

48:02.166 --> 48:02.433
Anna.

48:03.904 --> 48:08.484
A silly little name.
Perfect for a silly little
human.

48:22.727 --> 48:25.435
You pulled the fire alarm?
I totally had it under control.

48:25.502 --> 48:28.110
Sure you did. It looked like
you were about to be his pop
tart.

48:28.177 --> 48:29.547
I think they know
where the gate is.

48:30.685 --> 48:32.556
If they do and we don't,
we are fucked.

48:32.624 --> 48:33.727
Can't we go to David?

48:33.794 --> 48:35.030
What if David is the one
working with them?

48:35.800 --> 48:37.438
Are you serious? It could be me.

48:37.504 --> 48:40.781
They shot you. I don't think
they'd shoot
the person helping them.

48:40.848 --> 48:42.519
I don't trust
any other member of the Order,

48:42.586 --> 48:43.589
except maybe Jerome.

48:43.657 --> 48:44.827
Jerome has been
deemed trustworthy?

48:44.893 --> 48:47.267
He's too damn mean
to be influenced by the fae.

48:47.334 --> 48:49.072
I guess tonight wasn't
a total bust.

48:49.140 --> 48:52.349
You're right, it wasn't.
Because I'm awesome.

48:52.416 --> 48:55.625
Like I put the awe
with the some. Admit it.

48:56.696 --> 48:57.665
You know what I'll admit?

48:57.732 --> 48:59.035
Waiting.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.410
I'll admit you felt sweet as
silk
against my fingers

49:01.476 --> 49:02.947
when I had my hand
between those thighs...

49:03.014 --> 49:06.090
I was acting, you arrogant,
self-important, mother...

49:06.157 --> 49:10.069
Bullshit! You're acting
like nothing happened between
us.

49:10.135 --> 49:12.409
You lit up for me
like a goddamn firework.

49:13.379 --> 49:17.090
What is the deal?
Do you still love him?

49:17.759 --> 49:18.895
Your ex?

49:19.832 --> 49:23.409
A part of me... always will,
but no.

49:26.786 --> 49:27.454
I don't get it then.

49:28.657 --> 49:32.068
Why do you want me?
You barely know me.

49:33.439 --> 49:37.986
What I know is that
if you want something, you go
for it.

49:38.052 --> 49:41.162
I wanna know your story.
I wanna know you.

49:41.229 --> 49:43.636
I want... oh, fuck it!

50:17.103 --> 50:18.374
Let's not rush forward.

50:20.045 --> 50:22.653
But don't let us take three
steps
back from this, okay?

50:36.561 --> 50:39.337
- Can't make our coffee morning
date, sorry.
- Okay.

50:42.512 --> 50:45.053
- Ivy, let's get together.
- Can you meet me for coffee?

50:45.120 --> 50:46.290
So?

50:48.129 --> 50:49.600
I met a guy.

50:49.667 --> 50:50.904
You did?

50:50.971 --> 50:52.542
- He works with me.
- Is he cute?

50:54.080 --> 50:57.925
I don't think cute is
a strong enough word to describe
him.

50:57.992 --> 50:59.630
So he's hot. And you like him.

51:01.068 --> 51:03.609
I have a mad case of insta-lust
when it comes to him,

51:03.676 --> 51:06.384
but in a way,
we're kind of strangers.

51:07.821 --> 51:10.128
You know, people usually are
strangers
when they meet

51:10.195 --> 51:12.602
and then they get to know each
other
through, I don't know, dating.

51:14.174 --> 51:18.219
I don't know if he's interested
in dating or just hooking up.

51:18.286 --> 51:19.724
I don't even know
if I'm interested in dating.

51:19.790 --> 51:22.632
Then what's the problem?
If you both want it, go for it.

51:26.678 --> 51:30.390
The last guy I dated,
the only guy I've been with...

51:32.596 --> 51:33.632
he died.

51:36.073 --> 51:37.243
What?

51:37.778 --> 51:38.747
He...

51:40.921 --> 51:44.565
He died with my adoptive parents
in a car accident.

51:44.632 --> 51:47.607
I get it, you're not entirely
ready to move on.

51:47.674 --> 51:52.388
I think I'm ready to move on,
but is that wrong?

51:52.456 --> 51:54.996
Am I somehow betraying him?

51:55.063 --> 51:56.835
Oh honey,
that is not betraying him.

51:56.901 --> 51:58.874
If he cared for you,
he wouldn't want you

51:58.942 --> 52:02.017
to never go out
with another guy or fall in love
again.

52:02.084 --> 52:06.698
Moving on is the right thing to
do...
but do you trust him?

52:08.069 --> 52:10.610
Yeah... I trust him.

52:12.883 --> 52:13.953
See ya in class.

52:15.290 --> 52:17.864
- And thank you for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

52:30.770 --> 52:32.408
- Ivy?
- That would be me.

52:33.411 --> 52:35.016
I'm just surprised
you're calling me.

52:35.852 --> 52:36.821
Are you busy?

52:57.951 --> 52:58.921
Get used to it.

53:01.161 --> 53:02.464
My friend Brighton lives here.

53:02.532 --> 53:04.037
Her mom Merle
used to work for the Order.

53:04.103 --> 53:07.346
She was pretty high up.
She might know where the gate
is.

53:08.617 --> 53:10.856
You've known that this woman
could tell us the location?

53:10.923 --> 53:12.996
Yes. But I didn't
exactly trust you.

53:14.100 --> 53:15.470
So you're saying you
trust me now?

53:20.886 --> 53:21.856
Merle was caught by
the fae once.

53:23.227 --> 53:25.635
They fed off of her,
she was never the same since.

53:27.106 --> 53:31.184
Sometimes doesn't act right.
She could be completely normal
or...

53:32.321 --> 53:33.859
Hey, Brighton!
Thanks for seeing me.

53:34.895 --> 53:37.336
This is Ren.
He's part of the Order.

53:37.403 --> 53:38.674
You're new.

53:38.740 --> 53:41.683
Yes ma'am. I'm from Colorado.
Just transferred here.

53:42.418 --> 53:43.421
You're a long way from home.

53:43.487 --> 53:44.625
That I am.

53:44.692 --> 53:45.962
May I ask what you'd like to see
my mom about?

53:47.499 --> 53:50.810
We've lost four Order members
in a short time, and we think...

53:50.876 --> 53:51.578
they may have been
guardians of the gate.

53:53.217 --> 53:55.055
We think the fae are trying
to open the gate here on the
equinox.

53:56.226 --> 53:57.831
What does David have
to say about this?

54:00.238 --> 54:01.141
We haven't told him yet.

54:02.311 --> 54:03.982
If the members killed
were guardians,

54:04.049 --> 54:06.289
then someone within the Order
has to be feeding names to the
fae.

54:07.761 --> 54:09.833
And you wanna talk to my mom
about the location of the gate?

54:11.204 --> 54:14.180
Even if there's a slim chance
she could tell us...

54:17.589 --> 54:18.760
She's in the garden.

54:23.942 --> 54:26.984
- Mama...
- I know. We have company,
sweetheart.

54:27.051 --> 54:30.228
I may have a few bats in the
belfry,
but I'm not deaf.

54:31.733 --> 54:36.279
Well, hello there.
It's been a while since I've
seen you.

54:36.346 --> 54:39.589
And you brought someone
other than that hussy with you.

54:40.258 --> 54:42.231
Val. Merle, this is Ren.

54:42.297 --> 54:45.173
I know who he is. Renald Owens.

54:46.744 --> 54:47.714
Your full name is Renald?

54:48.649 --> 54:51.926
Why do you think I go by Ren?
Ma'am...

54:51.993 --> 54:55.603
Ooh, call me Merle, sweetheart.

54:55.670 --> 54:57.576
Mama, they're here to ask you
something important.

54:57.643 --> 55:01.923
I know they are.
Why don't you two take a seat?

55:01.989 --> 55:02.959
Cop a squat.

55:04.530 --> 55:05.835
I'll get us some tea.

55:13.524 --> 55:14.694
We're here...

55:14.761 --> 55:18.672
Like I said, darling,
I know why you're here.

55:18.740 --> 55:20.678
It has to do with the Elite.

55:20.746 --> 55:25.527
I know all about them.
If you're here...

55:25.593 --> 55:27.967
that means the ancients
are up to no good.

55:29.572 --> 55:30.073
You know about the ancients?

55:31.411 --> 55:34.085
I know that not all fae wish
for the same thing.

55:35.523 --> 55:39.201
Son, I also know
why you're really here.

55:40.471 --> 55:41.943
The Elite hunt the ancients,

55:43.112 --> 55:44.952
but that's not the only
duty you have.

55:48.061 --> 55:50.133
What do you wanna know, doll?

55:50.200 --> 55:51.271
They wanna know
where the gate is here.

55:52.541 --> 55:56.353
I used to be a guardian.
I know about everything.

55:58.124 --> 56:01.100
The wards used to seal
up the gates,

56:02.437 --> 56:04.175
the blood required to open them,

56:06.416 --> 56:07.452
the crystal that heals.

56:10.795 --> 56:12.334
Then I met my match.

56:14.707 --> 56:16.111
So they say.

56:17.716 --> 56:19.087
I really don't recall that day.

56:19.154 --> 56:20.458
Mama, do you know
where the gate is?

56:21.896 --> 56:27.813
My darling girl,
there isn't only one gate in our
city.

56:27.880 --> 56:29.250
There are two.

56:31.791 --> 56:36.005
Are you sure? I've never heard
of two doors being in one city.

56:37.576 --> 56:38.479
One is in the sanctuary,

56:40.117 --> 56:45.433
and the other is in a place
where the atmosphere is so
unsettled

56:46.670 --> 56:49.712
not even the humans
or the spirits can rest.

56:51.986 --> 56:54.125
Oh, it's pretty simple, girl,
I don't know how much clearer I
can be.

56:54.192 --> 56:57.134
But back to the more important
thing.
Have you found it yet?

56:58.237 --> 56:59.274
You're gonna need to find it.

57:00.745 --> 57:03.620
You know what will happen
if they come through that gate.

57:05.325 --> 57:06.830
I know.

57:06.897 --> 57:10.976
If the prince comes through,
or the princess, and they find
it,

57:11.043 --> 57:13.316
it'll all be undone, Renald.
Everything.

57:14.352 --> 57:15.355
Mama, what are you
talking about?

57:15.423 --> 57:18.297
I fear those gates
will break this time, Renald.

57:18.364 --> 57:19.635
It's in the wind.

57:19.702 --> 57:23.982
It's in the very song of the
birds.
It's in the soil.

57:24.683 --> 57:26.489
Everything will be undone.

57:27.426 --> 57:28.729
You must find the halfling.

57:28.796 --> 57:29.933
Halfling? Mama, what are you
talking about?

57:30.000 --> 57:33.176
Because it's a threat to it all.
To everything.

57:33.644 --> 57:34.680
Everything!

57:34.747 --> 57:35.917
Mama!

57:37.254 --> 57:39.963
I'm sorry, but you
two need to go.

57:41.266 --> 57:42.269
Mama...

57:43.874 --> 57:45.613
A halfling? What...

57:46.315 --> 57:48.020
We should leave.

57:48.087 --> 57:50.327
I'm not going anywhere until you
tell me
what the hell is really going
on.

57:51.664 --> 57:53.704
I'll tell you everything,
I'm not gonna do it here.

57:57.014 --> 57:58.952
I like seeing you in my place.

57:59.020 --> 58:00.290
Start with the halflings.

58:03.634 --> 58:04.435
Good choice.

58:05.506 --> 58:07.178
A halfling is a child
of a human and a fae.

58:08.482 --> 58:11.423
There used to be thousands,
but now there's only a few left.

58:12.092 --> 58:13.029
Why are there so few now?

58:14.299 --> 58:17.141
Our job, the Elite's,
is not just to hunt down
ancients.

58:17.208 --> 58:20.685
We're also given the duty
of hunting down the halflings.

58:21.621 --> 58:23.025
As in killing them?

58:25.498 --> 58:28.274
When the gates of the Otherworld
were created with magic,

58:28.341 --> 58:32.754
they were done so with the
ability
to be closed and opened.

58:32.821 --> 58:36.599
However, there is a loophole,

58:36.666 --> 58:40.545
one act that could open all
doorways
and we would never be able to
close them.

58:42.349 --> 58:44.924
If the prince or princess
were to procreate with a
halfling,

58:44.990 --> 58:48.769
the child resulting from such a
union
would undo the original spells

58:48.835 --> 58:50.040
creating the doorways.

58:50.106 --> 58:51.276
Holy shit.

58:52.747 --> 58:53.516
It's like the apocalypse baby.

58:54.887 --> 58:57.194
We have evidence
there is a halfling in New
Orleans.

58:58.364 --> 59:01.073
The person probably
has no idea what they are.

59:03.880 --> 59:07.258
The fae can't even sniff out a
halfling,
unless they get near their
blood.

59:07.324 --> 59:08.427
How do you find them?

59:10.032 --> 59:12.106
Well, most of them are
in the Order.

59:13.276 --> 59:14.947
You mean an Order member
had sex with a fae

59:15.014 --> 59:16.351
knowing what they were?

59:16.418 --> 59:19.828
Another constant among halflings
is that they are adopted.

59:20.631 --> 59:21.566
I'm adopted.

59:22.737 --> 59:23.406
You're not one of them, Ivy.

59:23.472 --> 59:24.977
How do you know?

59:25.044 --> 59:30.527
Your real mom and dad were
happily married before they were
killed.

59:32.098 --> 59:34.740
Plus, when you were shot,
that ancient likely would've
sensed

59:34.807 --> 59:35.776
if you were a halfling.

59:37.615 --> 59:39.287
We're reviewing members
of your Order now,

59:39.354 --> 59:44.737
so far we've learned that Miles
is adopted
and there's at least one more.

59:45.940 --> 59:47.478
And when you find this person...

59:49.250 --> 59:50.855
you're gonna kill them,
aren't you?

59:52.025 --> 59:53.396
That's part of my job, Ivy.

1:00:04.027 --> 1:00:05.231
My best friend...

1:00:06.936 --> 1:00:11.918
His name was Noah Cobb.
We grew up together, like
brothers.

1:00:13.957 --> 1:00:14.927
What happened?

1:00:16.899 --> 1:00:17.969
He was raised in the Order.

1:00:20.008 --> 1:00:22.751
From what we gathered,
it was a one night stand,

1:00:22.817 --> 1:00:23.787
his father and the fae.

1:00:25.124 --> 1:00:26.461
She brought the child to him.

1:00:27.899 --> 1:00:32.412
The woman his father married
accepted Noah as her own.

1:00:33.549 --> 1:00:35.756
But they had no idea
what being a halfling meant.

1:00:39.166 --> 1:00:40.703
He knew what
I was being trained to do.

1:00:44.215 --> 1:00:45.418
There were no
secrets between us.

1:00:49.162 --> 1:00:50.333
It was an accident.

1:00:53.877 --> 1:00:55.047
But it was my fault...

1:01:05.712 --> 1:01:07.317
I brought out a thorn stake.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:12.834
We were in our backyard
screwing around.

1:01:12.901 --> 1:01:16.678
My dad was there, and so was
another member of the Elite,
Kyle.

1:01:17.548 --> 1:01:19.420
I let Noah pick up
the thorn stake.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:22.897
And he cut himself.

1:01:24.669 --> 1:01:29.216
When a thorn stake cuts a
halfling,
their blood bubbles.

1:01:29.283 --> 1:01:30.687
Noah's blood bubbled.

1:01:32.794 --> 1:01:35.970
My dad saw it and...
so did Kyle.

1:01:40.818 --> 1:01:41.786
Noah left...

1:01:44.528 --> 1:01:48.206
And I just stood there...
in that damn backyard.

1:01:50.580 --> 1:01:51.750
And then Kyle left.

1:01:53.990 --> 1:01:56.230
I wanted to go after them,
but my dad stopped me.

1:01:59.841 --> 1:02:01.078
And Noah never made it home.

1:02:03.987 --> 1:02:04.588
Ren, I'm so sorry.

1:02:06.461 --> 1:02:10.238
To this day, I think about all
the things
that I could've done
differently.

1:02:10.305 --> 1:02:12.612
Like, if I never told him
about the Elite,

1:02:12.679 --> 1:02:16.624
then I never would've had
that thorn stake out there.

1:02:17.594 --> 1:02:18.664
He never would've cut himself.

1:02:18.731 --> 1:02:20.837
What happened to him
wasn't your fault.

1:02:22.843 --> 1:02:24.582
I didn't stop them
from killing him!

1:02:24.649 --> 1:02:26.488
What happened was terrible,

1:02:27.992 --> 1:02:30.400
and there are a lot of things
that could've been done
differently,

1:02:30.466 --> 1:02:32.606
but I doubt it
would've changed the outcome.

1:02:36.919 --> 1:02:37.922
I let him die.

1:02:46.146 --> 1:02:48.687
I don't ever wanna be
in that situation again.

1:04:11.903 --> 1:04:13.675
I like the way you look at me...

1:05:07.001 --> 1:05:08.339
Bake some brownies

1:05:09.041 --> 1:05:10.010
I'm a brownie

1:05:10.378 --> 1:05:11.949
Tink?

1:05:12.016 --> 1:05:15.828
You're interrupting my me time.
And you know baking is my me
time.

1:05:15.895 --> 1:05:18.202
When I found you by the
cemetery,
how far away from the gate you
were?

1:05:19.640 --> 1:05:22.247
I told you, I don't even
remember
coming through the gate.

1:05:22.314 --> 1:05:24.420
Did you know
there were two gates in the
city?

1:05:26.092 --> 1:05:28.399
No. There've never
been two gates.

1:05:29.670 --> 1:05:31.809
Merle said there were
two gates in the city,

1:05:31.876 --> 1:05:33.514
one in an old sanctuary,

1:05:33.581 --> 1:05:36.590
and the other in a place where
"no spirits or humans could
rest."

1:05:36.657 --> 1:05:38.429
Two gates would be very bad.

1:05:38.797 --> 1:05:40.201
Yeah.

1:05:43.845 --> 1:05:45.115
Do you know about halflings?

1:05:46.854 --> 1:05:47.423
Why haven't you told me
about them before?

1:05:49.127 --> 1:05:51.167
Having that kind of information
would've been very helpful

1:05:51.234 --> 1:05:53.174
since I'm assuming
you're aware of what could
happen

1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:54.978
if the prince or princess
gets a hold of a halfling.

1:05:55.045 --> 1:05:56.951
I had one job and I failed.

1:05:57.018 --> 1:05:58.857
You're not an internet meme.

1:05:58.924 --> 1:06:00.963
My job was to destroy
the gate in New Orleans.

1:06:01.264 --> 1:06:03.136
What?

1:06:03.204 --> 1:06:06.580
If the blood of an ancient is
shed
on the doorway from inside the
Otherworld,

1:06:06.646 --> 1:06:08.319
it destroys the door.

1:06:08.385 --> 1:06:11.361
If the blood of an ancient is
shed
on the outside, it opens the
door.

1:06:12.598 --> 1:06:14.872
We destroyed all the gates
in the Otherworld

1:06:14.938 --> 1:06:16.711
by luring ancients to them
and killing them.

1:06:16.778 --> 1:06:18.917
Are you saying all the gates
have been rendered useless?

1:06:19.920 --> 1:06:20.355
We had no idea
there were two gates here.

1:06:22.427 --> 1:06:25.771
That's why I've never been too
concerned
about what the ancients are up
to,

1:06:25.838 --> 1:06:26.673
but if they have
discovered a second gate,

1:06:28.211 --> 1:06:30.217
they'll open it,
and the knights will come
through.

1:06:30.285 --> 1:06:32.524
They'll bring the princess
and prince and you...

1:06:33.427 --> 1:06:35.199
you do not want that to happen.

1:06:39.044 --> 1:06:41.351
Everything's fine, babe.

1:06:42.889 --> 1:06:47.168
Oh, I have to go. Yeah, no.
I'll call you and let you know.

1:06:48.305 --> 1:06:49.275
Bye.

1:06:50.378 --> 1:06:52.049
I am so sorry
about blowing you off yesterday.

1:06:52.919 --> 1:06:54.490
Were you with the guy
you're seeing?

1:06:54.557 --> 1:06:58.803
Okay, actually I needed to sleep
in,
because he blew my back out...

1:06:58.870 --> 1:06:59.973
I get the picture.

1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:02.381
- I get it, that's enough.
- He blew it out.

1:07:02.447 --> 1:07:05.390
Like, I have no more back.
Back is gone, but...

1:07:14.750 --> 1:07:15.620
Wow.

1:07:16.556 --> 1:07:18.027
I think I just got pregnant.

1:07:19.365 --> 1:07:21.538
I've been waiting all day
for you to text or call me.

1:07:22.942 --> 1:07:24.747
It's okay, you're out
of practice,

1:07:24.815 --> 1:07:27.656
but I want to hear from you
day, night, morning.

1:07:27.723 --> 1:07:29.495
And I've got no problem
with anyone knowing

1:07:29.562 --> 1:07:31.368
what you and I both
got going on.

1:07:33.206 --> 1:07:35.245
David, you got a minute?

1:07:36.315 --> 1:07:37.987
Do I wanna have a minute?

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:39.692
Yes. Yes, you do.

1:07:42.199 --> 1:07:42.434
What are you doing?

1:07:44.005 --> 1:07:47.683
We need to talk to him.
I found some stuff out. Trust
me.

1:08:03.430 --> 1:08:04.767
I didn't invite you.

1:08:06.305 --> 1:08:08.512
Whatever is said in this room
goes no further.

1:08:08.579 --> 1:08:10.083
Hot and obvious.

1:08:10.150 --> 1:08:11.521
Make this quick.

1:08:14.830 --> 1:08:17.271
And they're planning on opening
the gate on the equinox on
Wednesday.

1:08:17.739 --> 1:08:18.274
In two days.

1:08:19.310 --> 1:08:21.518
She's not bullshitting you.
They're here.

1:08:21.584 --> 1:08:23.891
They've been in a club downtown
that caters to fae.

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:26.699
I'm surprised you've actually
seen
a fae since you've been here,

1:08:26.766 --> 1:08:28.973
because I'm pretty sure
the only thing you've been
concentrating on

1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:30.445
is how to get in that
girl's pants.

1:08:30.511 --> 1:08:33.687
That's an unjust observation,
David.
I can multitask.

1:08:35.793 --> 1:08:38.802
The ancients are going to open
the gate
and we know there are two in the
city.

1:08:40.173 --> 1:08:42.447
And the one by the cemetery
isn't working anymore.

1:08:42.514 --> 1:08:44.820
How the hell do you know
the location of that gate?

1:08:44.887 --> 1:08:47.361
Does it matter?
I also know about the halflings

1:08:47.428 --> 1:08:49.869
and what will happen if the
prince
or princess comes through the
gate

1:08:49.935 --> 1:08:51.106
and gets their hands on one.

1:08:51.173 --> 1:08:52.878
Halfling? What the hell
are you talking about?

1:08:52.945 --> 1:08:56.623
A half human, half fae.
If you don't listen to me

1:08:56.689 --> 1:08:59.297
and put every member you have
on the other gate in this city,

1:08:59.364 --> 1:08:59.865
they're going to get through,

1:09:01.136 --> 1:09:02.941
and whether you believe
in halflings or not,

1:09:03.009 --> 1:09:04.513
we're gonna have
a huge friggin' mess on our
hands.

1:09:05.683 --> 1:09:07.054
If she's saying
that there are two gates

1:09:07.121 --> 1:09:08.191
and that one of them
isn't working,

1:09:08.257 --> 1:09:10.330
you need to tell me
where that gate is.

1:09:10.397 --> 1:09:13.005
Pull your fucking resources,
and get it guarded now.

1:09:14.108 --> 1:09:17.017
Everyone but you...
out of the room.

1:09:34.369 --> 1:09:36.074
You know what
the really bad thing is?

1:09:37.646 --> 1:09:39.919
Someone in the Order
is working with the fae.

1:09:40.922 --> 1:09:42.493
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

1:09:43.396 --> 1:09:44.465
How does that make sense?

1:09:45.703 --> 1:09:48.077
All the members
who've been killed were
guardians.

1:09:49.949 --> 1:09:53.492
There's this club
where I overheard an ancient say

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:55.098
they know the
location of the gate.

1:09:57.071 --> 1:09:58.040
Holy crap.

1:10:01.684 --> 1:10:04.492
I have to go, but...
I'll call you later?

1:10:17.431 --> 1:10:18.835
You know we found Trent's phone.

1:10:20.675 --> 1:10:23.583
There's pictures of you and Ren,
by Jackson Square,

1:10:23.650 --> 1:10:25.221
looking mighty close.

1:10:26.325 --> 1:10:27.494
Well, that's kind of creepy.

1:10:27.561 --> 1:10:28.999
That was the night
he was killed.

1:10:30.771 --> 1:10:32.944
You know why he was taking
those pictures?

1:10:34.148 --> 1:10:34.717
He didn't trust you.

1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:41.336
He was worried that you'd
become...
influenced by the fae.

1:10:41.403 --> 1:10:43.008
Why the hell would
he think that?

1:10:44.077 --> 1:10:45.716
I'd have to be
without my clover for that.

1:10:46.518 --> 1:10:48.659
Something about your past, Ivy,

1:10:48.725 --> 1:10:51.868
pointed out things
that just didn't add up.

1:10:53.506 --> 1:10:56.615
Miles, I need to see you. Now.

1:11:03.704 --> 1:11:04.907
Where are we going?

1:11:08.685 --> 1:11:11.259
Holding hands is something that
people do
when they like each other, Ivy.

1:11:14.670 --> 1:11:17.110
David will have
both gates guarded.

1:11:17.177 --> 1:11:18.815
He doesn't believe
that one isn't working

1:11:18.882 --> 1:11:21.758
and isn't willing to risk
leaving
the other one unguarded.

1:11:21.824 --> 1:11:23.128
Where did you hear
about the other gate not
working?

1:11:24.064 --> 1:11:27.307
I... saw Merle this morning.

1:11:27.374 --> 1:11:29.547
She said the gate by the
cemetery
wasn't working anymore.

1:11:29.614 --> 1:11:33.994
And that all the gates had been
destroyed
except for the second one.

1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:35.063
Did David tell you where it is?

1:11:36.201 --> 1:11:37.337
We're standing right
in front of it.

1:11:47.434 --> 1:11:48.671
Come home with me, Ivy.

1:11:51.613 --> 1:11:52.851
I don't know...

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:54.923
I'm not gonna take you
to my place and ravish you.

1:11:56.127 --> 1:11:57.832
If you don't want that from me,
then...

1:11:57.899 --> 1:11:59.838
I do want that from you.
Always.

1:12:01.844 --> 1:12:05.220
Hell, it's all I've been
thinking about
since the first time you took a
swing at me.

1:12:08.564 --> 1:12:10.035
But it's not the only
thing I want.

1:12:21.168 --> 1:12:23.877
There's something
I wanna show you, give you.

1:12:28.757 --> 1:12:32.736
It's a thorn stake,
so you can kill an ancient.

1:12:37.451 --> 1:12:41.296
I can't say a guy has ever given
me
a weapon of stabby awesome
before.

1:12:45.007 --> 1:12:48.450
For tonight, let's just be...
normal.

1:12:49.587 --> 1:12:51.326
Like those people we
saw in the diner.

1:12:56.741 --> 1:12:58.414
We should probably
put this away then.

1:13:42.446 --> 1:13:43.415
Ready for bed?

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:48.363
It's really late.
I'm not suggesting anything,

1:13:48.430 --> 1:13:49.935
just stay with me.

1:13:51.573 --> 1:13:52.341
In your bed?

1:13:53.812 --> 1:13:56.956
It's a big bed.
Like three people could sleep in
there.

1:13:57.992 --> 1:14:00.165
And I have a shirt
if you wanna change into.

1:14:20.693 --> 1:14:23.602
Wearing my shirt might not
have been one of my brightest
ideas.

1:14:25.775 --> 1:14:28.450
I'm guessing you've never worn
a guy's clothes before?

1:14:29.487 --> 1:14:32.562
Shaun and I...
we never got to that point.

1:14:36.273 --> 1:14:39.115
Make yourself comfortable,
I'll be right out.

1:15:15.056 --> 1:15:16.561
I'm happy you're here.

1:15:18.366 --> 1:15:19.335
Are you?

1:15:19.770 --> 1:15:20.773
Yeah.

1:15:38.894 --> 1:15:40.666
That's all I wanted to hear.

1:16:05.641 --> 1:16:06.576
What are you doing?

1:16:07.279 --> 1:16:08.617
Waking you up.

1:16:10.455 --> 1:16:12.461
You were all tangled up with me.

1:16:14.267 --> 1:16:15.671
You're a cuddler.

1:16:15.738 --> 1:16:16.874
Nuh-uh.

1:17:10.033 --> 1:17:11.204
God, you're beautiful.

1:18:09.512 --> 1:18:10.715
Can I keep you?

1:18:22.517 --> 1:18:23.822
Hey, what's wrong?

1:18:24.523 --> 1:18:25.393
I have to go.

1:18:26.028 --> 1:18:27.900
Whoa. Ivy, talk to me.

1:18:30.441 --> 1:18:33.885
Did we move too fast?
Did I hurt you?

1:18:34.922 --> 1:18:38.900
No. You didn't hurt me...
Not yet.

1:18:40.772 --> 1:18:41.708
Not yet?

1:18:42.344 --> 1:18:43.547
You wouldn't mean to.

1:18:43.614 --> 1:18:44.583
You'll promise me
everything will be okay,

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:48.061
and then it won't be
because you can't control it.

1:18:48.127 --> 1:18:50.668
Let me get dressed though.
I'll take you home.

1:18:50.735 --> 1:18:53.711
No. I don't need you
to do anything.

1:18:54.848 --> 1:18:58.291
You're a great guy,
but this, whatever this is,

1:18:58.359 --> 1:19:00.297
isn't going any further.

1:19:00.365 --> 1:19:01.534
This was a mistake.

1:19:26.141 --> 1:19:29.117
Hi, this is Val.
Leave me a message after the
beep.

1:19:44.697 --> 1:19:47.706
EMERGENCY MEETING
OF THE ORDER

1:19:52.854 --> 1:19:53.624
Oh, my God, what happened?

1:19:55.128 --> 1:19:57.836
I ran into a fae last night.
It didn't wanna go down easy.

1:20:02.985 --> 1:20:03.854
Odd.

1:20:04.222 --> 1:20:04.690
What?

1:20:05.693 --> 1:20:07.364
Yesterday you and Ren
were locking lips,

1:20:07.431 --> 1:20:08.735
and today he's
standing over there,

1:20:08.802 --> 1:20:10.741
looking like he wants to put
his fist through the wall.

1:20:10.808 --> 1:20:13.817
It's a long story.
I tried calling you earlier.

1:20:14.553 --> 1:20:17.863
Yeah... I'm sorry.

1:20:26.355 --> 1:20:30.033
We now know that tomorrow night,

1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:33.911
on the equinox,
could very well be the fae
apocalypse.

1:20:35.816 --> 1:20:37.756
We could be facing
the ultimate fight.

1:20:39.294 --> 1:20:42.269
We cannot allow
an ancient near the gate.

1:20:43.406 --> 1:20:44.409
Their blood will open it.

1:20:46.381 --> 1:20:48.387
We need to keep them back,
no matter what.

1:20:50.060 --> 1:20:55.108
With all that being said,
there will be no patrols
tonight.

1:20:56.211 --> 1:20:59.487
If you have family,
I suggest you go home,

1:20:59.555 --> 1:21:00.523
spend time with them.

1:21:01.761 --> 1:21:03.266
If you don't have
anyone special,

1:21:04.335 --> 1:21:05.840
I suggest you use tonight
to find someone.

1:21:07.044 --> 1:21:10.053
Some of you will not be
coming home tomorrow night.

1:21:11.724 --> 1:21:12.894
That's all.

1:21:16.238 --> 1:21:19.748
Got plans for tonight?
I can't guarantee you'll get
laid though.

1:21:20.985 --> 1:21:25.532
Hmm... I think I'm gonna go
see my parents, okay?

1:21:48.401 --> 1:21:50.173
For someone
who is so strong and brave,

1:21:51.243 --> 1:21:52.781
I never would've thought
you'd be such a coward

1:21:52.847 --> 1:21:53.917
when it really counts.

1:21:53.984 --> 1:21:55.923
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:21:56.491 --> 1:21:59.267
Then tell me, Ivy.

1:22:46.441 --> 1:22:48.514
All of us have lost someone,
Ivy.

1:22:50.587 --> 1:22:52.091
Make me understand.

1:23:09.377 --> 1:23:11.516
If you tell me to leave,
I'll walk away. I swear.

1:23:13.857 --> 1:23:15.461
I’m not going down
without trying.

1:23:27.966 --> 1:23:30.340
Ivy, talk to me.

1:23:35.187 --> 1:23:37.193
I had just taken
the mark of the Order.

1:23:38.965 --> 1:23:44.247
I was... supposed to meet Shaun
at this restaurant in the city

1:23:45.351 --> 1:23:48.092
and I dressed up for it.

1:23:51.971 --> 1:23:53.509
I put on this...

1:23:56.083 --> 1:23:57.822
silver chain

1:23:57.889 --> 1:23:59.460
because it matched the dress.

1:24:03.606 --> 1:24:04.609
I...

1:24:07.016 --> 1:24:09.690
took off my protective clover.

1:24:15.073 --> 1:24:16.478
I was at the metro
and I saw a fae.

1:24:20.423 --> 1:24:22.295
She must've recognized me

1:24:22.362 --> 1:24:28.414
because all I remember
is her making a beeline for me,

1:24:29.617 --> 1:24:30.820
right in public.

1:24:32.994 --> 1:24:34.465
Before I could do anything...

1:24:36.371 --> 1:24:37.674
The fae compelled you.

1:24:39.747 --> 1:24:42.589
I don't remember her telling me
to take her to my house.

1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:52.920
I just remember... being home...

1:24:55.762 --> 1:24:56.865
in my living room.

1:25:02.181 --> 1:25:03.920
I remember...

1:25:05.057 --> 1:25:08.901
seeing my dad... lying
on the floor.

1:25:11.643 --> 1:25:15.287
His stake...

1:25:17.059 --> 1:25:18.831
was in his chest.

1:25:23.947 --> 1:25:26.755
And the fae, she practically
put me through a wall.

1:25:30.365 --> 1:25:32.271
My mom tried to help...

1:25:36.016 --> 1:25:37.687
but the fae snapped her neck.

1:25:44.407 --> 1:25:46.380
And then Shaun showed up...

1:25:50.125 --> 1:25:51.061
looking for me.

1:25:56.243 --> 1:26:00.923
She didn't... outright kill him.

1:26:02.896 --> 1:26:07.644
No. She toyed with him.

1:26:14.264 --> 1:26:15.433
It’s my fault.

1:26:16.704 --> 1:26:18.877
I'm responsible for all
their deaths!

1:26:18.944 --> 1:26:19.980
Ivy, no...

1:26:20.048 --> 1:26:22.021
That fae fed on me too...

1:26:23.625 --> 1:26:25.898
would have drained me
if another Order member hadn't
shown up.

1:26:27.303 --> 1:26:29.743
They couldn't figure out
how the fae got in the house.

1:26:31.616 --> 1:26:33.454
I could never
tell them the truth.

1:26:41.646 --> 1:26:44.320
I don't even know
why I'm telling you all this.

1:26:44.387 --> 1:26:50.238
It's not... justification
for how I behaved.

1:26:50.305 --> 1:26:52.177
It's not an excuse.

1:26:52.244 --> 1:26:53.782
I know you're not
making excuses.

1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:57.493
You made a shit choice
when you were young.

1:26:58.162 --> 1:26:59.633
God knows I understand.

1:27:00.502 --> 1:27:01.973
It's not the same.

1:27:03.043 --> 1:27:07.256
It's not?
My best friend was killed

1:27:07.323 --> 1:27:08.827
and I did next to
nothing to stop it.

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.140
You can't tell me
I can't feel guilt over what
happened.

1:27:15.045 --> 1:27:19.459
Maybe neither of us
can truly forgive ourselves.

1:27:20.595 --> 1:27:22.769
The only thing we can do
is learn from our mistakes

1:27:24.173 --> 1:27:24.942
and not make them again.

1:27:26.279 --> 1:27:30.592
I've lost everyone I loved.
I've lost everyone.

1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.231
You haven't lost me.

1:27:32.297 --> 1:27:33.702
But what if?

1:27:40.221 --> 1:27:41.826
Tomorrow we could die...

1:27:43.597 --> 1:27:47.176
or we could live.

1:27:47.242 --> 1:27:48.612
But we're both here, right now.

1:28:41.371 --> 1:28:42.608
I want you.

1:30:17.626 --> 1:30:18.595
Is this okay?

1:31:08.947 --> 1:31:10.585
You really are wicked.

1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:34.455
Someone's hungry.

1:31:34.824 --> 1:31:36.061
Maybe.

1:31:54.182 --> 1:31:56.221
You owned me with just one kiss.

1:32:01.804 --> 1:32:03.242
I'm getting us breakfast.

1:32:16.048 --> 1:32:17.251
I wasn't doing anything!

1:32:17.318 --> 1:32:19.057
You were in her kitchen.
Eating her Frosted Flakes.

1:32:19.123 --> 1:32:20.527
What in the actual fuck?

1:32:20.595 --> 1:32:23.837
I always eat her cereal,
and you're naked, completely
naked!

1:32:23.904 --> 1:32:26.545
I can explain, Ren,
but I need you to let him go.

1:32:26.613 --> 1:32:27.582
You heard the woman.

1:32:28.952 --> 1:32:30.123
You want me to let
this thing go?

1:32:30.190 --> 1:32:33.332
He's my thing, I mean,
he's not a thing.

1:32:33.399 --> 1:32:35.138
He's a brownie, and he's okay.

1:32:35.205 --> 1:32:36.576
He's not gonna hurt anything.

1:32:36.643 --> 1:32:38.715
What do you mean he's yours?
I come into the kitchen

1:32:38.782 --> 1:32:42.359
and he's sitting in a bowl
of Frosted Flakes like a talking
rat.

1:32:42.426 --> 1:32:44.633
- I'm not a rat, you
overgrown...
- Tink!

1:32:45.936 --> 1:32:47.040
His name is Tink?

1:32:47.107 --> 1:32:48.879
Well, that's what I call him.

1:32:50.985 --> 1:32:53.927
Am I high? I gotta be high.

1:32:55.833 --> 1:32:57.204
Is he wearing doll pants?

1:32:57.271 --> 1:32:58.441
What's it to you?

1:32:58.507 --> 1:33:00.781
I'm sorry.
I should've warned you...

1:33:00.848 --> 1:33:02.085
You should've warned me.

1:33:02.152 --> 1:33:04.525
I'm the one who had to see
his dong swinging around.

1:33:04.592 --> 1:33:08.371
Tink! Okay.
I can explain everything,

1:33:08.437 --> 1:33:11.413
but I need you to let him go,

1:33:11.480 --> 1:33:15.592
and... you should probably
put something on.

1:33:20.741 --> 1:33:21.711
Oh, my God!

1:33:33.880 --> 1:33:36.120
What were you doing?
You had to know he was here.

1:33:36.188 --> 1:33:39.664
Oh I know. I heard.
I didn't think he'd stay the
night.

1:33:39.732 --> 1:33:41.303
One night stands don't
stay the night.

1:33:41.369 --> 1:33:42.439
Not a one night stand, asshole!

1:33:43.910 --> 1:33:47.956
Him? Really? You decide to dust
the cobwebs off with him?

1:33:48.022 --> 1:33:50.263
Nothing is wrong with him,
you little jackass.

1:33:52.236 --> 1:33:54.542
No one knows about him.
Not even Val.

1:33:55.545 --> 1:33:57.551
He's a creature
of the Otherworld, Ivy.

1:33:57.618 --> 1:34:00.660
I found him a couple of years
ago,
badly hurt, by the cemetery.

1:34:00.728 --> 1:34:02.466
I'd never seen a brownie before

1:34:02.533 --> 1:34:04.438
and even though
I was supposed to finish him
off,

1:34:04.505 --> 1:34:06.445
I took him home and healed him.

1:34:07.381 --> 1:34:09.119
You know how powerful
brownies can be?

1:34:09.186 --> 1:34:10.657
He's good at cleaning the house.

1:34:13.265 --> 1:34:14.736
So you basically
have a pet brownie?

1:34:15.906 --> 1:34:17.946
I wouldn't necessarily
call him a pet.

1:34:18.012 --> 1:34:19.584
Then what do you call him?

1:34:19.650 --> 1:34:22.659
I call him... Tink.
He's my friend.

1:34:24.164 --> 1:34:24.967
And I protect her.

1:34:25.836 --> 1:34:26.806
I wouldn't go that far.

1:34:28.577 --> 1:34:31.085
Brownies hate the fae, Ren.

1:34:31.151 --> 1:34:32.389
They aren't the enemy.

1:34:32.456 --> 1:34:34.262
The brownies have destroyed
almost all the gates

1:34:34.328 --> 1:34:35.498
from inside the Otherworld.

1:34:37.103 --> 1:34:39.945
That's how I know
about the gates being destroyed.

1:34:40.881 --> 1:34:44.325
Merle didn't tell me.
It was Tink.

1:34:44.392 --> 1:34:45.695
Please don't tell
anyone about him.

1:34:46.999 --> 1:34:51.613
I don't trust the little shit,
but I respect your decision.

1:34:52.850 --> 1:34:55.926
Well, I don't trust you either,
so what-the-fuck-ever.

1:34:57.063 --> 1:35:00.172
You gave Tink a scarf.
Tink is free!

1:35:01.509 --> 1:35:04.685
Jesus. A fucking brownie.
I was not expecting that.

1:35:11.439 --> 1:35:14.682
Listen, tonight's gonna be hard.

1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:17.825
I just wanna make today
special for you.

1:36:28.604 --> 1:36:29.740
Don't go tonight.

1:36:30.710 --> 1:36:32.883
I have to. It's my job,
you know that.

1:36:33.852 --> 1:36:37.764
Ivy, please be careful,
because there...

1:36:37.831 --> 1:36:41.041
There are worse things
than death if that gate opens.

1:37:05.413 --> 1:37:07.319
You make sure
you walk back down those stairs,
Ivy.

1:37:08.724 --> 1:37:09.894
You, too.

1:37:18.687 --> 1:37:19.255
Thank you for today.

1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:25.340
It was probably my favorite day
in... well, forever.

1:37:26.310 --> 1:37:27.279
Me too.

1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:32.696
So... where's the gate?

1:37:32.762 --> 1:37:33.999
It's in the master bedroom.

1:37:50.382 --> 1:37:51.753
Oh, my God.

1:37:55.765 --> 1:37:57.035
That is crazy.

1:38:03.287 --> 1:38:05.360
We can't let an ancient
near the door.

1:38:05.427 --> 1:38:07.968
If one happens to get close,
do not cut it,

1:38:08.034 --> 1:38:11.211
their blood opens the gate.
Push them back.

1:38:16.426 --> 1:38:17.396
It's time!

1:38:45.547 --> 1:38:46.516
They're here.

1:38:53.136 --> 1:38:54.106
Hold!

1:39:22.859 --> 1:39:24.029
Ivy!

1:39:52.347 --> 1:39:53.317
Ren!

1:39:54.554 --> 1:39:55.590
Hello there!

1:39:58.031 --> 1:40:00.070
Guess what? You failed!

1:40:22.404 --> 1:40:23.574
Val! No!

1:41:14.895 --> 1:41:16.131
It's the prince!

1:41:39.970 --> 1:41:40.939
Doc!

1:41:42.979 --> 1:41:43.948
Valerie!

1:41:44.850 --> 1:41:46.623
- Ivy...
- Why?

1:41:47.726 --> 1:41:50.635
I wish it hadn't been you
that chased after me.

1:41:59.462 --> 1:42:03.306
Your hair. It's the
color of fire.

1:42:05.045 --> 1:42:07.351
It's rather... abrasive.

1:42:08.655 --> 1:42:10.561
I'm not here
to talk about my hair.

1:42:11.330 --> 1:42:12.534
You're here to fight me then?

1:42:13.136 --> 1:42:14.507
I'm here to end you.

1:42:15.408 --> 1:42:20.257
You humor me.
I'm feeling... kind.

1:42:21.426 --> 1:42:22.965
I shall let you live.

1:42:28.549 --> 1:42:30.588
A thorn birch stake
from the Otherworld, I presume?

1:42:30.989 --> 1:42:32.393
You betcha.

1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:34.600
And you think that you can use
it
successfully against me?

1:42:35.736 --> 1:42:37.843
That is silly.

1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:40.417
You talk too much.

1:42:41.554 --> 1:42:43.326
I do not wish to harm a female,

1:42:43.392 --> 1:42:46.368
but my kindness
is rapidly diminishing.

1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:49.812
I give you one last chance.

1:42:49.879 --> 1:42:54.025
But you will not like how this
ends,
my lovely little bird.

1:42:54.092 --> 1:42:56.933
I'm not your anything, buddy.

1:43:01.948 --> 1:43:02.717
What did you do to Val?

1:43:03.921 --> 1:43:09.270
I did nothing. I think she is,
perhaps, intelligent?

1:43:09.337 --> 1:43:10.675
She knows we cannot be stopped.

1:43:11.978 --> 1:43:15.556
No. She would never willingly
help your kind.

1:43:15.623 --> 1:43:17.094
If that makes you feel better.

1:43:19.735 --> 1:43:20.738
Too slow.

1:43:21.908 --> 1:43:24.482
You cannot fight me,
little bird.

1:43:33.175 --> 1:43:37.656
I no longer have any patience
or kindness left in me.

1:43:44.007 --> 1:43:45.145
Fly, little birdie.

1:44:16.505 --> 1:44:18.945
You should've left
when you had the chance, little
birdie.

1:44:25.766 --> 1:44:26.836
No!

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:31.651
Halfling.

1:44:39.039 --> 1:44:40.008
Ivy!

1:44:43.185 --> 1:44:44.255
Ivy!

1:44:45.291 --> 1:44:46.261
Ivy, stay with me.

1:44:48.702 --> 1:44:51.142
Ivy! Stay with me.

1:45:12.707 --> 1:45:13.977
Hey there, sleepy-butt.

1:45:15.315 --> 1:45:16.351
Hey.

1:45:23.539 --> 1:45:24.709
I thought...

1:45:26.013 --> 1:45:27.317
when I saw you in that room...

1:45:30.895 --> 1:45:35.308
I'm okay... I think.

1:45:39.152 --> 1:45:44.067
The knights...
the prince, they got out.

1:45:46.374 --> 1:45:49.149
Strangely, it wasn't the giant
apocalypse
we thought it would be.

1:45:50.420 --> 1:45:51.389
The Order...

1:45:53.429 --> 1:45:56.070
or what's left of the Order,
has been on patrol.

1:45:57.106 --> 1:45:58.845
We haven't seen
a single knight or that...

1:46:06.735 --> 1:46:09.175
David and a few
are heading to Flux tonight,

1:46:09.242 --> 1:46:11.817
but I have a feeling
they aren't gonna find anything.

1:46:13.689 --> 1:46:15.294
We managed to get
the gates closed again.

1:46:19.239 --> 1:46:20.343
Have you found Val?

1:46:20.410 --> 1:46:21.379
No.

1:46:22.817 --> 1:46:24.990
No one's seen her,
not even her family.

1:46:26.795 --> 1:46:28.801
She was carrying something, Ren.

1:46:29.972 --> 1:46:33.382
She went to the headquarters
for a reason.

1:46:35.053 --> 1:46:36.090
I know.

1:46:45.953 --> 1:46:48.360
That was crazy
going after the prince.

1:46:50.633 --> 1:46:51.836
You could've died.

1:46:54.612 --> 1:46:55.815
I don't know what I
would've done.

1:46:56.216 --> 1:46:57.353
I'm here.

1:47:02.402 --> 1:47:03.872
How bad do I look?

1:47:05.979 --> 1:47:07.484
You've never looked better.

1:47:18.216 --> 1:47:19.887
I'm gonna have to go
back to the Order.

1:48:03.919 --> 1:48:05.423
Aren't you supposed
to be at work?

1:48:06.059 --> 1:48:07.429
You're not my keeper.

1:48:17.259 --> 1:48:20.001
I just wanted to stop by real
quick.
Make sure you're okay.

1:48:20.068 --> 1:48:21.371
You could've texted me.

1:48:22.876 --> 1:48:24.047
Wait.

1:48:25.016 --> 1:48:26.955
What's that smell?

1:48:34.444 --> 1:48:35.013
I really don't like that thing.

1:48:36.618 --> 1:48:39.693
I'm sure the feeling is mutual,
but thank you for the beignets.

1:48:42.368 --> 1:48:44.440
It was really just an excuse
to come see you.

1:48:46.113 --> 1:48:47.751
I hate the idea
of leaving you alone right now.

1:48:48.452 --> 1:48:50.091
I'm not alone.

1:48:50.158 --> 1:48:51.228
That little freak doesn't count.

1:48:51.295 --> 1:48:53.301
Hey, he's my freak.

1:48:57.814 --> 1:48:59.152
Are you sure you're okay?

1:49:00.288 --> 1:49:02.629
I'm okay. I swear.

1:49:04.032 --> 1:49:05.805
I plan on showering,
crashing on the couch

1:49:05.871 --> 1:49:10.085
and then hopefully,
if Tink doesn't devour them all,

1:49:10.151 --> 1:49:13.026
eating sugary goodness
until I pass out.

1:49:15.901 --> 1:49:17.273
I'll be home as soon as I can.

1:50:00.635 --> 1:50:03.511
When a thorn stake cuts a
halfling,
their blood bubbles.

1:50:10.933 --> 1:50:12.237
What are you doing?

1:50:13.307 --> 1:50:14.712
The prince was gonna kill me.

1:50:16.183 --> 1:50:19.392
But he healed me,
and he said halfling.

1:50:22.267 --> 1:50:23.905
When I was bleeding...

1:50:26.078 --> 1:50:28.920
he said... halfling.

1:50:30.693 --> 1:50:31.394
Ivy.

1:50:32.631 --> 1:50:35.172
Brownies have always been able
to sense the Otherworld

1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:38.014
in other creatures,
no matter how minimal.

1:50:40.790 --> 1:50:44.433
It wasn't a coincidence
that I found you, was it?

1:50:45.805 --> 1:50:46.941
Don't do it, Ivy.

1:51:00.047 --> 1:51:01.718
And when you find this person...

1:51:06.333 --> 1:51:08.071
you're gonna kill them,
aren't you?

1:51:10.143 --> 1:51:11.113
Oh, my God.

1:51:27.128 --> 1:51:28.732
That's part of my job, Ivy.

1:51:36.222 --> 1:51:37.726
I told you not to do it.

1:51:41.036 --> 1:51:42.006
No!

1:51:45.683 --> 1:51:49.495
to be continued....
