-[woman] Seq, I'm in.
-[Seq] Captain.

00:59.058 --> 01:00.310
[woman] You were right.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.811
The skylight
was a window pane.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.396
[Seq] I've got
serious interference.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.813
[woman] Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.691
[Seq] Looks like old code.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.151
[woman] It feels
really familiar.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.986
[Seq] Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.738
-[woman] I'm gonna
check it out.
-[Seq] Bugs?

01:11.821 --> 01:13.031
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...

01:13.114 --> 01:14.783
[Bugs] A quick peek can't hurt.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.159
-[static]
-[Seq] Did you hear that?

01:16.242 --> 01:17.619
Shit. I think
our signal was traced.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.829
Bugs, this feels like a trap.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.039
Bugs!

01:21.122 --> 01:22.415
[suspenseful music playing]

02:00.995 --> 02:03.498
[SWAT officer] Freeze!
Do not move!

02:03.581 --> 02:04.541
We will shoot!

02:04.624 --> 02:07.919
Very slowly, raise your hands.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.545
[suspenseful music playing]

02:21.808 --> 02:23.393
[lieutenant] Here we go.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.733
Hey, where are you going?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.026
You were warned, Lieutenant.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.362
I think we can handle
one little girl.

02:37.782 --> 02:38.908
You're wasting your time!

02:38.992 --> 02:41.244
My men are bringing her
down now.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.412
No, Lieutenant,

02:43.496 --> 02:45.498
your men are already dead.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.674
[gasps slowly]

02:56.050 --> 02:57.302
Seq, you with me?

02:57.385 --> 02:58.761
This old code keeps crashing.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.179
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.598
[Seq] Bugs,
this is a direct violation

03:01.681 --> 03:02.932
of the general's protocols.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.434
I know, I know.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.144
But something
is happening here.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.771
Something important.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.939
[Bugs] Oh, fuck.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.608
We know what happens next.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.359
She kicks their ass.

[all grunting]

03:32.045 --> 03:33.087
[groans]

03:35.882 --> 03:37.300
Now she makes a call.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.635
[woman] The line was traced.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.970
-And then...
-Then she runs for her life.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.388
[woman] Are there any agents?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.890
We know this story.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.060
This is how it all began.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.604
God damn it.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.147
This is where he began.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.484
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

03:54.567 --> 03:58.112
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.364
I don't know.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.158
But I'm going to find out.

04:02.241 --> 04:03.368
All right.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.359
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.611
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.321
I don't know.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.698
[all grunting]

04:52.208 --> 04:53.626

04:53.710 --> 04:55.044
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

04:55.128 --> 04:56.671
that's not what happens.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.591
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

05:00.675 --> 05:03.052
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.388
-It's gotta be a trap.

As you were.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.395
I'm just gonna...

05:55.313 --> 05:57.065

07:43.296 --> 07:45.047
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.674
Okay.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.509
My name is Bugs.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.887
As in "Bunny."

07:50.970 --> 07:52.680
And tech that listens.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.725
Do you know this is a Modal?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.102
What's a Modal?

07:58.186 --> 08:00.479
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.235
Do you understand
that you are...

08:07.153 --> 08:08.821
digital sentience?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.573
I know what I am.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.908
Just like I know my job

08:11.991 --> 08:14.076
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.411
Like you.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.125
And yet...

08:22.877 --> 08:24.212
Here we are.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.713
Here we are.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.467
The other agents
don't know about this room?

08:31.427 --> 08:32.595
How'd you find it?

08:32.678 --> 08:35.181
No one was ever
in the key shop,

08:35.264 --> 08:36.474
so I started looking.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.727
More you looked,
the more you found.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.355
Story of my life.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.488
What?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.242
I feel like I know this room.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.294
Holy shit.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.131
This is his apartment.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.299
[gasps]

09:10.383 --> 09:12.468
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

09:12.551 --> 09:14.512
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.847
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

09:16.931 --> 09:19.308
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.143
Neo.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.854
You do.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.524
Oh, okay.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.484
Uh...

09:28.567 --> 09:31.195
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.949
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.702
But I know he's not.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.413
Because I've seen him.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.458
Where?

09:44.542 --> 09:47.086
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

09:51.591 --> 09:54.719
But the moment
he looked at me,

09:54.802 --> 09:56.429
I felt something...

09:59.765 --> 10:01.475
unlock my mind.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.104
Okay.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.358
Something like that
happened to me.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.948
I saw this pattern...

10:17.241 --> 10:18.659
and it was everywhere.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.663
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

10:22.747 --> 10:25.291
these strange,
repeating loops.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.627
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.464
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.347
And suddenly I understood.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.891
This is not the real world.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.688
[agent] For the first time,
I felt real purpose.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.316
I knew who I was

10:50.399 --> 10:52.318
and what I had to do.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.403
Who are you?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.448
What do you have to do?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.702
I am...

11:02.495 --> 11:03.871
Morpheus.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.291
And I have to find Neo.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.379
[Bugs gasping]

11:11.462 --> 11:12.797
Morpheus.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.385
Okay. Okay.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.552
Oh, my God!

11:18.636 --> 11:19.929
I have to get you out of here.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.431
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
Okay, come with me.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.310
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.686
And if you're not,

11:27.770 --> 11:28.771
if you think that
this is where you belong...

11:32.274 --> 11:33.692
You call this a choice?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.277
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

11:35.361 --> 11:36.862
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

11:36.946 --> 11:38.531
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

11:38.614 --> 11:40.491
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.909
And the woman
with the pills laughed

11:41.992 --> 11:43.160
'cause I was
missing the point.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.787
What point?

11:44.870 --> 11:47.790
The choice is an illusion.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.084
You already know
what you have to do.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.925
Truth.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.641
Okay.

12:05.724 --> 12:06.934
There's an old building

12:07.017 --> 12:08.602
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.895
The Lafayette.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.522
One of the four back doors
leads there.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.482
[Morpheus] Oh.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.067
-Don't fight it.
-Whoa, what's happening?

12:15.151 --> 12:16.235
Keep breathing.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.695
Extraction works
pretty much the same

12:17.778 --> 12:19.697
for humans and programs.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.534
Ouch.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.660
Ah.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.371
Okay.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.210
I've never worn
different glasses before.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.046
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

12:36.130 --> 12:37.923
-It's gotta be...
-Okay.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.680

12:44.763 --> 12:45.973

-Problemo?
-He lost something.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.178
Is this old Matrix code?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.765
A little Modal experiment.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.810
-For Binary?

smoke up your ass,

15:03.569 --> 15:07.990
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.659
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.910
Are we all just algorithms

15:11.994 --> 15:13.203
doing what we're
supposed to do

15:13.287 --> 15:14.997
or can we escape
our programming?

Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.170
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.006
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade. [chuckles]

15:24.089 --> 15:26.258
Your game almost ruined me.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.844
-So you've said.
-Yet here we are.

15:28.927 --> 15:31.764
-[cups clink]
-You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

15:31.847 --> 15:32.890
is it free will

15:34.141 --> 15:35.768
or destiny?

15:40.439 --> 15:42.358
Oh, yeah.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.360
There she is.

I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.618
Maybe you should go.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.746
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.081
Best self.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.252
Sure.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.546
You ever talk to her?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.092
Tell you what.

16:08.175 --> 16:12.554
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.391
Jude, no. Stop.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.184
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Thanks.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.686
Hi. Um...

16:18.769 --> 16:20.354
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.064
I'm Jude Gallagher.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.733
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.068
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.071
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.073
-Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
-Jude.

16:31.156 --> 16:35.077
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.079
He is a bona fide
famous person

16:37.162 --> 16:38.539
and considered by most to be

16:38.622 --> 16:40.624
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.917
I'm sorry about this.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.210
-Jude...
-[softly] Just talk to her.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.796
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

16:46.672 --> 16:47.881
Hi.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.181
Have we met?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.768
Uh, we both come here.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.270
-Can I have your morning bun?
-[boy] Hey!

17:01.353 --> 17:02.771
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.147
-Brandon!
-[chuckles]

17:04.231 --> 17:06.108
[boy 2] Can I have one bite?

17:06.191 --> 17:09.194
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.195
This is my husband, Chad.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.073
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.785
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.954
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]

17:19.038 --> 17:20.664
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.170
[soft music playing]

17:45.022 --> 17:46.023
What?

17:46.106 --> 17:48.025
[keyboard clacking]

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
[ominous music playing]

17:53.489 --> 17:55.824
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.833
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

18:06.043 --> 18:07.878
oblivious."

18:09.838 --> 18:12.216
I always loved that line.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.759
You wrote that one, yeah?

18:16.470 --> 18:18.639
Every time I stand here,

18:18.722 --> 18:21.975
I mean, O-M-G.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.102
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.563
-Right?
-[chuckles softly]

18:28.440 --> 18:29.691
Yeah.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.693
Sure.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.612
Have a seat.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.532
[man sighs]

18:36.615 --> 18:37.825
Smoke?

18:39.117 --> 18:40.160
I thought you quit.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.413
I quit calling it a habit.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.415
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

18:47.584 --> 18:51.171
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.298
I know Binary is over budget.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.676
This is not about Binary, Tom.
It's bigger than that.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.094
This is about our future,

18:57.177 --> 19:00.138
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.431
What do you mean?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.143
How's the therapy?

19:04.226 --> 19:05.519
Good.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.688
Any...

19:08.647 --> 19:09.982
episodes?

19:11.775 --> 19:12.860
No.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.279
That's terrific.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.492
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.411
What did you say
about our first meeting?

19:22.494 --> 19:25.747
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.874
[muffled yell]

19:27.374 --> 19:28.375
[scoffs]

19:28.458 --> 19:29.877
But look at this place.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.296
We did this.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.882
Together.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.718
Yeah.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.761
Now what?

19:39.845 --> 19:43.432
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.809
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

19:45.893 --> 19:47.269
parent company, Warner Bros.,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.771
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.273
What?

19:51.356 --> 19:53.275
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.193
I thought
they couldn't do that.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.320
[exhales]

19:56.403 --> 19:57.779
Oh, they can.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.197
And they made it clear

19:59.281 --> 20:01.450
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.243
Really?

20:03.327 --> 20:07.205
I know you said the story
was over for you,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.458
but that's the thing
about stories.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.170
They never really end,
do they?

20:13.253 --> 20:15.797
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

20:15.881 --> 20:20.177
just with different names,
different faces

20:21.803 --> 20:24.890
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.894
After all these years,

20:28.977 --> 20:31.980
to be going back
to where it all started.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.399
Back to The Matrix.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.235
I've spoken to Marketing...

20:37.319 --> 20:41.490
-[sinister music playing]
-[distorted voice]

20:43.200 --> 20:44.743
[in normal voice] Tom?

20:44.826 --> 20:46.370
Yeah.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.496
Are you all right?

20:47.579 --> 20:48.997
[exhales nervously]

20:49.831 --> 20:50.958
Yeah.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.090
[analyst] What were you feeling
at that point?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.970
What was I feeling?

21:06.264 --> 21:11.019
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

21:11.103 --> 21:15.357
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

21:15.440 --> 21:16.984
that has imprisoned me...

21:17.609 --> 21:18.777
again.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.737
[laughs]

21:22.698 --> 21:23.865
[chuckles softly]

21:29.454 --> 21:30.956
Not much of a choice.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.249
No.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.917
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.295
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.964
Yeah.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.216
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

21:41.299 --> 21:44.177
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.013
Those facts have combined

21:46.096 --> 21:48.598
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.225
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

21:50.308 --> 21:51.435
with your business partner

21:51.518 --> 21:52.978
and he ambushed you,

21:53.061 --> 21:55.480
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.900
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.737
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.697
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.575
We've talked about the value

22:06.658 --> 22:10.203
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.665
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

22:13.749 --> 22:14.958
I believe this episode

22:15.042 --> 22:16.835
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.589
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

22:20.672 --> 22:23.717
it was for you
to share something like this.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.511
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.389
[chuckles softly]

22:31.600 --> 22:33.894
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

22:33.977 --> 22:35.687
[sighs]

22:35.771 --> 22:36.938
Yeah.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.195
[pills rattle]

22:47.783 --> 22:50.160
[mysterious music playing]

22:57.084 --> 22:58.293
[grunts softly]

22:59.544 --> 23:01.755
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

23:01.838 --> 23:04.132
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

23:04.216 --> 23:06.301
to be working on a game
that was such a...

23:06.384 --> 23:08.470
well, game changer.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.138
Now, the packet
in front of you

23:10.222 --> 23:13.016
has our focus group research.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.559
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

23:14.643 --> 23:17.479
including keyword association
with the brand.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.649
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

23:20.732 --> 23:22.776
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

23:22.859 --> 23:25.070
as you begin
working on Matrix 4.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.198
And who knows how many more?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.118
[alarm buzzing, stops]

23:36.790 --> 23:38.083
[singing indistinctly]

23:43.713 --> 23:47.134
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.510
On point.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.595
People want us
up in their grey space,

23:50.679 --> 23:53.723
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.101
["White Rabbit" playing]

23:59.521 --> 24:00.981
[man laughing]

24:02.858 --> 24:06.194
What made Matrix different?
It effed with your head.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.113
People want us
up in their grey space,

24:08.196 --> 24:09.531
switching their synaptic

24:09.614 --> 24:12.242
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.625
[panting]

24:20.709 --> 24:22.252
[shower running]

24:22.335 --> 24:26.548
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.050
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

24:29.134 --> 24:31.553
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.513
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.557
We need guns! Lots of guns.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.226
Matrix means mayhem.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.937
[grunting]

24:42.898 --> 24:45.066
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.568
[man] She's right.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.696
Matrix is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

24:49.779 --> 24:51.448
-tight PVC.
-Yeah.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.408
Ideas are the new "sexy."

24:55.368 --> 24:57.370
["White Rabbit"
continues playing]

25:07.547 --> 25:09.257
Obviously
The Matrix is about...

25:09.341 --> 25:11.593
-...trans-politics.
-Crypto-fascism.

25:11.676 --> 25:12.594
It's a metaphor...

25:12.677 --> 25:14.346
...of capitalist exploitation.

25:26.816 --> 25:31.196
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

25:31.279 --> 25:33.365
Why not? Reboots sell.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.495
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

25:38.578 --> 25:42.415
You say Matrix to anyone...
You say Matrix...

25:42.499 --> 25:45.460
[echoing] Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

25:45.543 --> 25:47.379
...this is what they see.
[mimics explosion]

25:47.462 --> 25:49.589
-[guns firing]
-[bullets whizzing]

25:52.717 --> 25:53.969
[clicks tongue]

25:54.052 --> 25:56.346
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.598
Bullet time! Bullet time!

25:59.266 --> 26:00.308
That's two words.

26:04.312 --> 26:07.482
We need
a new "bullet time." [echoing]

26:08.650 --> 26:09.985
[laughs maniacally]

26:10.068 --> 26:13.989
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.867
Revolutionize gaming
again! [echoing]

26:20.620 --> 26:22.914
["White Rabbit" continues]

26:43.768 --> 26:45.520
[barista] Afternoon, Tiff.

26:45.603 --> 26:46.771
The ushe?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.024
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.609
I'll have a cortado today.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.237
Fly that freak flag.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.072
Mind if I get that?

26:56.156 --> 26:57.198
Oh, hi.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.201
Hi.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.787
[Tiffany] I remember
wanting a family,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.164
but was that because

27:04.247 --> 27:06.916
that's what women
are supposed to want?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.710
How do you know
if you want something yourself

27:08.793 --> 27:11.921
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.006
Mmm.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.009
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

27:16.092 --> 27:18.678
to answer
such questions for me.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.971
Smart.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.264
I should get more therapy

27:21.348 --> 27:23.767
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.602
Kids are exhausting, you know?

27:27.187 --> 27:29.439
No. Never had kids.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.275
Oh, right, I knew that.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.819
-Sorry. I googled you.
-[chuckles]

27:36.780 --> 27:39.366
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

27:39.449 --> 27:41.993
-Must be amazing.
-Uh...

27:42.077 --> 27:43.578
A lot of hours.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.705
Sometimes it is amazing.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.290
Most times...

27:48.500 --> 27:49.793
I don't know.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.379
But you made The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

27:52.462 --> 27:56.257
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.468
-So, worth it?
-[chuckles]

28:04.808 --> 28:07.394
Can I ask something
about your game?

28:07.477 --> 28:08.728
Sure.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.064
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

28:16.194 --> 28:18.196
There is a lot of me in him.

28:18.279 --> 28:20.615
[indistinct shouting]

28:20.698 --> 28:23.868
Maybe a little too much.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.622
Can I ask you something else?

28:27.705 --> 28:28.915
Please.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.919
There's a woman in your game.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.130
Trinity.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.717
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

28:41.261 --> 28:42.387
God, yeah.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.014
I like her.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.518
-I like Trinity.
-Ah.

28:48.601 --> 28:49.853
And I dig her Ducati.

28:49.936 --> 28:52.939
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.151
[engine revs]

28:56.234 --> 28:58.945
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.155
Really?

29:00.238 --> 29:03.616
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

29:03.700 --> 29:08.329
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.624
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

29:11.708 --> 29:13.751
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

29:14.836 --> 29:17.338
He didn't get it until I said,

29:17.422 --> 29:19.424
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

29:21.259 --> 29:22.969
You know what he did?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.555
He laughed.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.146
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.772
How could it not be, right?

29:36.983 --> 29:38.610
Made me so angry.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.447
I hated myself for laughing.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.202
I wanted to kick him so hard.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.787
Not too hard.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.082
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.334
[chuckles]

29:56.294 --> 29:58.129
And right now,
you're probably regretting

29:58.213 --> 29:59.714
sitting down with me.

30:01.883 --> 30:05.762
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.097
[chuckles]

30:08.181 --> 30:10.058
-[cell phone ringing]
-[gasps]

30:10.141 --> 30:11.851
I have to take this.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.564
Hi, this is Tiff.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.732
Oh, God, no.

30:17.815 --> 30:18.942
[gasps]

30:19.776 --> 30:21.778
I'll be right there.

30:21.861 --> 30:24.697
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.866
Oh.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.327
I gotta go.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.123
I hope I see you again.

30:46.761 --> 30:51.975
[alarm blaring]

30:52.058 --> 30:53.184
[announcer on speaker]
There has been a report

30:53.268 --> 30:54.769
of an emergency.

30:54.852 --> 30:56.771
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit

30:56.854 --> 30:58.898
and leave the building
immediately.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.358
What's going on?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.277
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.945
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.446
Or they're just a dick.

31:05.530 --> 31:08.283
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.701
[cell phone buzzes]

31:23.381 --> 31:26.175
[suspenseful music playing]

31:29.554 --> 31:31.222
[security guard] Sir, this way.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.229
Jude?

31:39.731 --> 31:40.815
Jude!

31:47.280 --> 31:49.240
At last.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.327
[chuckles] Ah.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.870
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

31:53.953 --> 31:55.955
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.165
What?

31:57.248 --> 31:58.666
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.210
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.171
At last.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.673
All these years later,
here's me,

32:05.757 --> 32:08.009
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.218
Tragedy or farce?

32:09.302 --> 32:10.928
I know you.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.014
Not every day
you meet your maker.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.265
This can't be happening.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.017
Oh, most definitely is.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.561
You can't be
a character I coded.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.688
100% natural.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.528
[gasps softly]

32:28.154 --> 32:29.364
How?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.616
All the explanation you need.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.454
Oh.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.705
No.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.540
No, no, no.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

32:41.501 --> 32:44.128
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

32:44.212 --> 32:48.549
[hesitating]
It was a test. An experiment.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.052
An experiment?

32:52.595 --> 32:54.555
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

32:54.639 --> 32:56.015
left me to bang my head till

32:56.099 --> 32:58.351
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

32:58.434 --> 32:59.936
as an experiment.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.021
-The exit's breaking down.
-He hasn't taken the pill.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.439
What? There's no time.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.566
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.111
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

33:08.194 --> 33:10.363
[tense music playing]

33:10.446 --> 33:12.073
Still open.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.576
This... This can't be real.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.495
[SWAT officer] Target acquired.
We got him.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.002
[grunting]

33:25.086 --> 33:26.421
This isn't happening.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.965
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.258
[SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

33:32.969 --> 33:34.470
[all screaming]

33:38.182 --> 33:39.934
[groaning]

33:46.357 --> 33:47.900
This can't be happening.

33:49.777 --> 33:50.945
-[gunshots]
-[gasps]

33:51.028 --> 33:52.780
[SWAT officer 3]
Freeze! Don't move!

33:55.283 --> 33:56.451
[gun firing]

34:01.748 --> 34:02.874
Neo!

34:08.713 --> 34:11.090
[tense music playing]

34:13.842 --> 34:15.386
[gun firing]

34:17.764 --> 34:19.181
Oh, my God!

34:21.225 --> 34:23.018
[distorted gunfire]

34:30.193 --> 34:31.402
[men groaning]

34:33.446 --> 34:34.530
[grunting]

34:40.536 --> 34:41.829
[tense music continues]

34:53.925 --> 34:55.009
Neo!

34:57.345 --> 34:59.806
[tense music builds]

34:59.889 --> 35:02.099
[shouts] Mr. Anderson!

35:02.934 --> 35:04.185
No!

35:04.268 --> 35:05.311
It can't be.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.947
I've missed you.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.704
[cat meows]

35:26.624 --> 35:28.334
[bell tinkling]

35:31.212 --> 35:32.880
It's in my mind.

35:34.006 --> 35:35.383
It's in my mind.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.474
[cup clinking]

35:43.558 --> 35:45.059
[analyst]
Can you hear me, Thomas?

35:46.310 --> 35:49.105
Follow my voice.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.900
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.360
[bell tinkling]

35:54.944 --> 35:56.320
The bell.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.241
Do you hear the bell?

36:03.661 --> 36:06.706
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

36:08.332 --> 36:09.625
You must have walked.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.918
I heard Deja Vu outside,

36:11.002 --> 36:12.253
opened my door,
and there you were.

36:16.048 --> 36:17.508
[Thomas Anderson exhales]

36:17.592 --> 36:20.428
You feel like
you can talk about it?

36:20.511 --> 36:21.762
When we started
working together,

36:21.846 --> 36:23.598
you had lost your capacity

36:23.681 --> 36:26.225
to discern reality
from fiction.

36:26.309 --> 36:29.478
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.856
You said you wanted
to fly away.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.819
[indistinct chatter]

36:41.115 --> 36:42.491
[people shouting]

36:45.202 --> 36:47.955
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.374
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.918
Can you tell me
how it started?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.630
He texted me.

36:56.797 --> 36:58.132
Who?

36:58.215 --> 36:59.675
Morpheus.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.843
Ah.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.930
So, he's back.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.182
It wasn't actually him.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.645
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.897
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

37:12.980 --> 37:14.982
came to help you escape

37:15.066 --> 37:18.694
from a virtual reality
called The Matrix.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.790
Am I crazy?

37:30.873 --> 37:33.334
We don't use that word
in here.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.337
What word should I use?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.757
What word explains
what is happening to me?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.509
Can I see the texts?

37:42.426 --> 37:43.886
[exhales]

37:43.970 --> 37:45.513
They were erased.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.105
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

37:54.188 --> 37:56.148
what do you think
we'd find there?

37:56.232 --> 37:57.274
Nothing.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.071
Because there was no attack.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.865
No one was killed.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.910
No one texted.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.037
My mind made it all up.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.125
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.710
Is that what you believe?

38:16.502 --> 38:18.379
It felt real.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.214
Of course.

38:20.297 --> 38:23.217
It was your great ambition
to make a game

38:23.300 --> 38:25.678
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.221
To achieve this goal,

38:27.304 --> 38:29.765
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.101
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

38:32.184 --> 38:34.395
cast him as your nemesis.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.105
A married woman named Tiffany

38:36.188 --> 38:39.525
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

38:39.608 --> 38:43.779
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your Matrix.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.656
There's nothing wrong
with that.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.199
It's what artists do.

38:47.283 --> 38:50.661
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

38:50.745 --> 38:53.080
endanger us or other people.

38:55.332 --> 38:57.710
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

38:57.793 --> 38:59.170
do we, Thomas?

39:07.261 --> 39:09.388
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

39:09.472 --> 39:11.891
-Who are you?
-My name is Trinity.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.601
[Oracle] No one can tell you
you're in love.

39:13.684 --> 39:16.187
You just know it,
through and through.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.773
Balls to bones.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.649
[Trinity whispers]
You feel this?

39:22.359 --> 39:24.070
I'm never letting go.

39:24.987 --> 39:26.113
[yells]

39:26.947 --> 39:27.990
[both grunting]

39:31.744 --> 39:33.788
[Morpheus] You have
to let it all go, Neo.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.248
Free your mind.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.881
[cell phone buzzing]

39:43.964 --> 39:45.091
-[buzzing stops]
-[sighs]

39:46.175 --> 39:47.384
[pigeon cooing]

39:55.017 --> 39:56.477
Huh.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.562
Looks easy enough.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.235
[exhales]

40:05.402 --> 40:08.030
"Free my mind." Shit.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.575
[suspenseful music playing]

40:13.202 --> 40:15.246
Okay.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.747
Free my mind.

40:22.837 --> 40:23.838
[grunts]

40:32.972 --> 40:34.515
I fly...

40:35.432 --> 40:37.351
or I fall.

40:37.434 --> 40:38.894
[suspenseful music builds]

40:40.354 --> 40:41.355
[grunts]

40:42.731 --> 40:43.983
[both grunting]

40:45.151 --> 40:46.402
Who the hell are you?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.363
You won't remember me,

40:49.446 --> 40:52.700
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

40:52.783 --> 40:55.161
when you leapt off
another roof.

40:55.244 --> 40:58.164
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,

40:58.247 --> 40:59.957
pretending my life...

41:00.040 --> 41:04.170
until I looked up
and I saw you.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.755
It was a different you,
but I saw

41:07.548 --> 41:09.300
the real you,

41:09.383 --> 41:11.177
just a second before...

41:12.636 --> 41:13.721
you leapt.

41:13.804 --> 41:14.972
[people shouting]

41:18.475 --> 41:20.269
And you never fell.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.735
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

41:28.319 --> 41:29.320
Yeah.

41:29.403 --> 41:30.738
[cell phone buzzing]

41:30.821 --> 41:32.364
That'll be Jude.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.782
He's not your friend.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.326
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

41:35.409 --> 41:36.452
He's on his way here,

41:36.535 --> 41:38.370
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.081
Jude.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.583
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.376
We have a major problemo.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.504
Are you alone?

41:50.257 --> 41:53.052
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.429
[Bugs] They don't look like
typical Agents.

41:55.512 --> 41:56.931
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

41:57.014 --> 41:58.140
which means they're everywhere

41:58.224 --> 42:00.476
and you never know
who to trust.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.311
Why should I trust you?

42:04.396 --> 42:07.483
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

42:07.566 --> 42:09.276
I will be caught and killed

42:09.360 --> 42:10.569
and you will be put right back

42:10.653 --> 42:11.904
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

42:11.987 --> 42:13.113
just like they did
the last time

42:13.197 --> 42:14.365
you tried to leap
your way out.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.118
I know why you left
your Modal open.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.663
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.790
And it's because of him
that we were able
to get to you.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.750
I know these things
the same way

42:24.833 --> 42:27.586
that I knew one day
I would find you.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.297
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.262
If you want the truth, Neo,

42:37.513 --> 42:39.515
you're going
to have to follow me.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.059
Okay.

43:01.578 --> 43:04.206
-Where are we?
-Tokyo.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.125

run to phone booths
anymore, either.

Oh, no.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.291
It's all about set

43:48.125 --> 43:49.376
and setting.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.587
After our first contact
went so badly,

43:51.670 --> 43:53.547
we thought elements
from your past

43:53.630 --> 43:55.132
might help ease you
into the present.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.052
Nothing comforts anxiety like

You gotta see it

44:33.170 --> 44:34.421
If this is real,

44:34.505 --> 44:37.132
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

44:38.842 --> 44:40.219
this happened?

44:41.095 --> 44:43.806
[soft music playing]

44:49.061 --> 44:50.687
But if it did...

44:54.817 --> 44:56.360
then we died.

44:56.443 --> 44:58.362
Obviously not.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.863
Why the Machines
kept you alive

44:59.947 --> 45:02.825
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

45:02.908 --> 45:04.743
are questions
we don't have answers to.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.412
Hide me?

45:06.495 --> 45:10.791
I've been at a company making
a game called The Matrix.

45:10.874 --> 45:13.460
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.087
We've been tracking
that company for years.

45:15.170 --> 45:17.965
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

45:18.048 --> 45:19.633
What we didn't understand

45:19.716 --> 45:22.219
was that they could
alter your DSI.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.054
Pods generate
your digital self-image

45:24.138 --> 45:26.640
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

45:26.723 --> 45:28.725
This is how
you look to yourself.

45:28.809 --> 45:32.521
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

45:32.604 --> 45:35.107
This is how
everyone else sees you.

[suspenseful music playing]

45:49.204 --> 45:51.165
Twenty years?

45:52.458 --> 45:56.003
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

45:56.086 --> 45:57.921
It took a lot longer
than that.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.007
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

46:00.090 --> 46:01.842
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.510
What?

46:03.594 --> 46:05.804
There's so much we don't know.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.639
Like why you've barely aged,

46:07.723 --> 46:09.933
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.351
[Morpheus] But based on
what we do know,

46:11.435 --> 46:12.769
it appears no one found you

46:12.853 --> 46:14.688
because you didn't
want to be found.

46:14.771 --> 46:17.524
-That's not true.
-[Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.

46:17.608 --> 46:18.817
Maybe there's no foundation

46:18.901 --> 46:20.068
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

46:20.152 --> 46:21.320
because you were working

46:21.403 --> 46:22.821
with the Machines
from the beginning.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.031
Morpheus, stop.

46:24.114 --> 46:27.242
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

46:27.326 --> 46:29.870
for you to show us
what is real.

46:29.953 --> 46:32.164
If you want out,

46:32.247 --> 46:33.624
you'll take this pill.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.544
But if you are
where you belong,

46:37.628 --> 46:39.797
you can go back to this.

59:19.305 --> 59:21.015
[Neo groaning]

59:24.143 --> 59:25.520
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

59:28.147 --> 59:30.775
-Holy shit.
-Fight for her!

59:30.858 --> 59:32.443
[yelling]

59:35.154 --> 59:36.364
[explosion]

59:46.332 --> 59:47.333
[gasps]

59:56.718 --> 59:57.719
[sighs]

01:00:22.827 --> 01:00:24.537
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.957
Mind if I...

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.638
How are you doing?

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.309
If this plug is actually real,

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:50.605
that means
they took my life...

01:00:51.689 --> 01:00:53.066
[scoffs]

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.526
and turned it
into a video game.

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.281
How am I doing?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.284
I don't know.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:05.536
I don't even know how to know.

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:08.122
That's it, isn't it?

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.834
If we don't know
what's real...

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.046
we can't resist.

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:19.425
They took your story,

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.010
something that meant

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.347
so much to people like me,

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:28.643
and turned it
into something trivial.

01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:32.230
That's what the Matrix does.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:35.274
It weaponizes every idea.

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.443
Every dream.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.738
Everything
that's important to us.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:45.493
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:48.621
as ordinary as a video game?

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.706
That sounds like the Oracle.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.041
[Bugs chuckles]

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:53.918
Heard so much about her.

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.256
She was gone
before I was free.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.300
Gone?

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.220
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.265
there was a purge.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.061
[sighs]

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:15.898
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

01:02:17.358 --> 01:02:18.818
No.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.611
No, there was peace.

01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:27.160
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:30.746
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:34.041
The Matrix is
the same or worse.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.335
And I'm back where I started.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.549
It feels like
everything I did,

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.093
everything we did...

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:49.182
[both grunt]

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.310
...like none of it mattered.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.189
All of it mattered.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.442
I can show you.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.704
This is my crew.

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:17.001
Our operator, Seq.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:23.090
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:24.634
Nice to meet you.

01:03:25.676 --> 01:03:27.720
Dad loved redwoods.

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.055
When he escaped the Matrix

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.681
and found out
they no longer existed,

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:32.266
it almost killed him.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.559
Lucky, he met Mom

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:36.062
and here I am.

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:39.857
This is Lexy,
Berg and Ellster.

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:41.734
Hi.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:44.403
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.948
Roland was your grandfather?

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.824
He always laughed,

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:49.867
joking how he never
believed in you.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.411
But, in private, he said that

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.622
you freed his mind
a second time.

01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.749
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.834
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.420
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.713
A what?

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.841
There's a lot of people
out there like me

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.261
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.512
I would never have recognized

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:10.721
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:12.056
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:14.100
I've got, like,
a million questions.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:16.644
Me too. Starting with them.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.021
[Bugs] It's okay.

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:21.023
Come meet him.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.400
This is Cybebe.

01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:23.901
That's Octacles.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:26.654
-That's Lumin8.
-[chittering]

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:28.990
Machines are on our side now?

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:30.283
They are synthients.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.034
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.452
Your contact
with the Synthient City

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.913
had a huge impact
on their world.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.123
[Bugs] That's what I meant.

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.457
What you changed

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.126
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.547
The meaning of "our side."

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.048
[Cybebe warbling softly]

01:04:48.342 --> 01:04:50.177
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:51.429
to help get you out.

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:53.889
Thank you.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.475
But why?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.103
[Morpheus]
Not all seek to control.

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.188
Just as not all
wish to be free.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.233
What is that?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.611
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.821
It gives programs
access to this world.

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:10.114
Within limits.

01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:13.200
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.827
Morpheus.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.953
Thank you.

01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:17.455
It was my honor.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.499
[chuckles] Wow.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.751
-[crew chuckles]
-How does it work?

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.336
Paramagnetic oscillation.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.587
If you want,

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:25.921
I can download
the codex manual for you.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.424
-Sure.
-Downloading used to be fun.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:30.885
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:32.678
Can I ask them something?

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.851
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:40.102
[warbling softly]

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.064
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.608
It could be Trinity.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.027
It's her.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:51.197
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.200
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:55.951
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.120
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:00.581
We burned
our one shot for you.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.708
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.835
we have no idea how to do it.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:05.920
Yet.

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:11.217
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.343
but we did.

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:16.681
Okay.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:19.892
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:24.605
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.066
We're here.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.192
Zion?

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:37.743
Have a seat.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.579
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.622
Quite a few synthients

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.165
deserve that title before me.

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:44.417
[Control on radio]
Mnemosyne, you are cleared

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.876
for landing. Welcome home.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.628
[Hanno] Thank you, Control.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.296
Um, we're about to crash.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:52.216
[dramatic music playing]

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.137
[chuckles]

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.471
General realized we were

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:59.598
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.809
we just got better
at hiding from them.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:07.982
Welcome to Io.

01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:11.026
Io.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.903
[sweeping music playing]

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.202
Wow. That looks real.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.288
Bio-sky.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.210
Works kind of like
grow lights.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:29.962
It's way more complex
than that.

01:07:30.045 --> 01:07:32.506
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.926
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.345
Plus... [sighs]

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.973
it is pretty to look at.

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.850
As opposed to that.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:46.729
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:06.415
God damn.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.709
It is you.

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:10.753
Niobe?

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:16.175
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:19.929
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:22.680
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:24.683
Neither did I.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.100
I told you he was alive.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.145
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:29.854
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.566
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.527
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.069
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

01:08:36.153 --> 01:08:38.823
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:41.742
We found The One.

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:45.287
I don't believe in The One.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.666
I never did.

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:50.417
No?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.045
Me neither.

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:55.506
But there was a time

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:58.259
when you trusted me
with your ship,

01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:00.135
against the Council's orders.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.304
The world was different then.

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.765
We were different.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.228
Report to the docks.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.020
Scrub down the Mnemosyne.

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.399
Transfer your access codes.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.899
You are done, Captain.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.026
[gasps softly]

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.412
We need to talk.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.295
[Niobe] When word first came

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:36.630
that it actually
might be you...

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:44.179
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:54.023
It is nice to see you.

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:56.817
-It's good to see you too.
-[glasses clink]

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:05.451
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.495
[chuckles] Yes.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.331
A lot has changed.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.792
Except maybe you.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.130
You remember this?

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.973
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.975
the Matrix pumps
into your head

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.852
until you unplug.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:33.228
[Neo sighs]

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:34.688
Yeah.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:37.691
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.985
Takes over every damn thing,

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.779
just like the Matrix.

01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:44.448
War.

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:48.786
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.873
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:56.627
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.173
But then, they left.

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:04.843
They said you saved us.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.095
I didn't believe it.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.515
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

01:11:10.182 --> 01:11:11.433
But then,

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:16.230
I would wake up to this...

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:21.694
silence.

01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:26.699
I'm ashamed of it now.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:30.786
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:34.123
a world without war
was possible.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.543
You gave me that.

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.504
You gave that gift to us all.

01:11:40.587 --> 01:11:44.258
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.721
Come help me get up.

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.556
Let's take a walk.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:53.851
[mysterious music playing]

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:05.070
[elevator door opens]

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.665
Oh! Beautiful.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.711
This is Freya, head of botany.

01:12:20.794 --> 01:12:24.089
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:28.177
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.929
Nothing travels
faster than light,

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.264
except gossip.

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.390
[Freya chuckles]

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:36.060
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:39.271
A strawberry?

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:41.065
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.567
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.069
And they grow here?

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:46.779
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:49.406
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.241
-We're getting there.
-[chuckles]

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:53.702
Go ahead. Try it.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.126
[Niobe chuckles]

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.420
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.422
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:07.883
That slop
that tasted like rust.

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:13.097
Zion could have never
made something like this.

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:14.807
Why?

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.476
Because we needed synthients

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.520
and DI like him.

01:13:19.603 --> 01:13:22.981
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.442
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:29.404
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:32.491
This city was built by us

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.243
and them.

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.458
What happened to Zion?

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:44.962
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:50.384
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:54.179
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:58.016
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.353
For the first time,

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:04.648
we saw machines at war
with one other.

01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:11.655
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:16.285
That was the last
we heard from her.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.331
Morpheus.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:25.794
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.755
High Chair of the Council.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:32.259
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:36.555
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.056
he ignored them.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.769
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:46.815
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.276
believing in you.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.706
I'm sorry.

01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:06.960
How could I know
this would happen?

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:09.338
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:11.256
No more than we do now.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.635
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:17.429
but I need your help.

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:20.557
Trinity is alive.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.392
Then there is
another question.

01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:24.269
Why did they keep her alive?

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:25.604
I can't answer that.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:29.024
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

01:15:29.107 --> 01:15:30.651
I have to try.

01:15:30.734 --> 01:15:34.655
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:40.619
I'm sorry, Neo.

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:44.373
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:47.542
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:50.712
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.297
till we have
better understanding

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.799
of what's going on.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:56.927
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

01:15:57.010 --> 01:16:00.806
I know it doesn't seem fair,

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.684
but neither does growing old.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.894
But you don't
hear me complaining.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.190
[elevator whirring]

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.741
Sorry.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.868
I've never met
a legend before.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.331
Neo.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:29.376
Sheperd. [breathes shakily]

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:30.669
[chuckles in disbelief]

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.587
Crazy. You're real.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:35.674
"Real."

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:38.760
There's that word again.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.643
[Sheperd] People talk a lot
about the old days.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.979
About you, the viral Agent.

01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:51.690
The siege of Zion.

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.775
Everything was simpler
back then.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.361
People wanted to be free.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.365
It's different now.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.910
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.872
Like the Matrix won.

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.248
[unlocks door]

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.084
This is you.

01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:17.382
And I gotta ask you one thing.

01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:21.136
Is it true you could fly?

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:26.975
Cool.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.231
[locks door]

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.038
[trickling]

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:57.422
[Morpheus grunts]

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.799
Morpheus.

01:17:58.882 --> 01:18:01.802
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.179
[Morpheus exhales]

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:05.764
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:07.933
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.726
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the Mnemosyne

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.937
-with a toothbrush.
-"Supposed to be"?

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.355
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:14.689
waiting for you
to make the choice

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.608
to remain meekly incarcerated

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.027
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:21.697
But that ain't a choice.

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:26.034
[dramatic music playing]

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:36.461
[Sheperd] General,
what should we do?

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:42.467
[Freya] Bugs has the same
independence of mind

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.010
she had the day you freed her.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:47.097
This is not
independence of mind.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:48.223
It's mutiny.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.809
[Freya] Come on, 'Be.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:53.895
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.690
Just like I know
there's a part of you

01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:59.818
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:05.115
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.494
This scares me.

01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:21.339
That's her.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.549
[Seq] On the bridge.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.092
Got her.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.684
[engine revving]

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.020
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:37.856
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:39.566
the way she reads...

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.904
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.867
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:52.162
What if she's happy
where she is?

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.873
How did I read?

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.877
Exactly like her.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.883
Take us to broadcast depth.

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:07.385
[suspenseful music playing]

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:17.646
Thank you for helping me.

01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:21.274
Most of us are here
because of you.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:25.070
I also admit our only chance

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.571
to get out
of the general's doghouse

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.281
is for you to find your mojo.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.577
What if I can't be
what I once was?

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.747
-Then we're all fucked.
-[signal beeps]

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.207
[Hanno] Two minutes.

01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:38.667
Two minutes to broadcast.

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:49.177
[Seq] I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.929
[Seq chuckles]

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.472
Should be safe.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.776
Portal's open.

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.987
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.613
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.533
Let's go.

01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:41.896
So, what do you think of him?

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:44.774
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:47.360
The beard, the hair... Oh.

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.864
-No, totally works for me.
-[scoffs] You idiot.

01:21:50.947 --> 01:21:52.324
I mean "The One" thing.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:56.953
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.831
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.377
[guns cocking]

01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:06.755
Predictable as ever.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:10.759
Smith.

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:13.178
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.262
[chuckles]

01:22:21.311 --> 01:22:22.604
This is so insane.

01:22:22.687 --> 01:22:23.938
There's so many theories
about the two of them

01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:25.690
and they're standing
right there.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.359
This code is freaky!

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.320
He's like an Agent, but not.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.076
An appeal to reason.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.790
How did you find us?

01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:44.793
You never appreciated
our relationship.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.252
Not like The Analyst.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.254
-The what?
-My doctor.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:52.050
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.802
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

01:22:53.885 --> 01:22:57.305
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.391
I still don't know
how he did it.

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:02.268
You, as a balding nerd.

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.104
Hilarious.

01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:06.564
And me... [sighs]

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.317
even more perfect.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:11.403
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:13.405
What do you think?

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:15.448
What do you want, Smith?

01:23:17.617 --> 01:23:19.911
I have such dreams, Tom.

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:21.705
Big dreams.

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:24.541
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:26.042
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.169
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

is stay out of the Matrix,

the good doctor to me.

and makes your fictions real?

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:14.954
Allow me.

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.998
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:19.416
They're everywhere.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.086
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.630
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:29.426
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.719

Ooh! Nicely done.

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:49.697
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.741
Why your own brain
tortures you?

01:37:52.825 --> 01:37:56.328
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:57.580
It works just like this.

01:37:57.663 --> 01:38:00.291
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:03.294
If only you could move faster.

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.921
[chuckles] Here's the thing
about feelings.

01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:08.299
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:11.135
Turns out, in my Matrix,

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:14.680
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

01:38:14.763 --> 01:38:17.224
the more energy you produce.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.518
It's nuts. [chomps]

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:21.186
I've been setting
productivity records

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:22.563

01:38:22.646 --> 01:38:25.482
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

People stay in their pods,

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:30.112
happier than pigs in shit.

01:38:30.195 --> 01:38:31.405
The key to it all?

01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:32.823
You.

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.074
And her.

losing what you do.

For 99.9% of your race,

01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:43.375
that is the definition
of reality.

01:38:43.459 --> 01:38:46.337
Desire and fear, baby.

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.381
Just give the people
what they want, right?

01:38:50.507 --> 01:38:51.884
[squelches]

01:38:58.682 --> 01:39:01.727

you have, Thomas.

General ordered me

01:39:40.432 --> 01:39:41.433
to look after the ship.

01:39:41.517 --> 01:39:43.394
So you shadowed us?

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:45.062
Check your long-range scans.

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:47.147
Squids are combing this area.

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:48.691
He's right.

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:49.942
You can stay here and die,

01:39:50.025 --> 01:39:52.403
or come back
and face a court-martial.

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:54.488
And you call that a choice?

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:03.831
[Niobe] Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

01:40:03.914 --> 01:40:07.292
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:08.585
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.587
Do shut your mouth.

01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:12.965
Do address me as General.

01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:17.302
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

01:40:17.386 --> 01:40:19.388
which she exercised
with her own

01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:22.975
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

01:40:24.226 --> 01:40:25.310
Shortsighted?

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:30.941
You care more
about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:33.527
We are not going
to have this argument again.

01:40:33.610 --> 01:40:35.946
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:37.239
You gave up on people.

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:41.034
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

01:40:41.118 --> 01:40:42.202

[chittering softly]

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:04.224
Okay.

Thank you for seeing me.

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.614
I figured if there was anyone

01:41:18.697 --> 01:41:20.991
who could make sense
of this mess,

01:41:21.074 --> 01:41:22.868
it would be you.

Hello, Neo.

01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:25.996
I know you.

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:28.081
I tried to keep my eye on you.

[clicks tongue]

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:32.669
Why?

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.505
We met a long time ago.

01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:37.299
Good morning.

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:41.094

01:41:41.178 --> 01:41:43.680
My father knew
we'd meet again,

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:46.725
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:48.602
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

01:41:48.685 --> 01:41:50.938
was the greatest regret
of his life.

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:52.898
I don't understand.

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:55.943
My father
was the chief engineer

01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:57.277
at the Anomaleum.

01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:58.737
[Niobe] The what?

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:01.907
My father designed
the resurrection pods

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:03.909
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.204
[Niobe] I'm sorry.

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:08.789
You knew what happened to him?

01:42:08.872 --> 01:42:12.084
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:14.378
and you didn't tell me?

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:17.381
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.091
But Io needed you.

01:42:19.174 --> 01:42:20.509
This city needed to be built

01:42:20.592 --> 01:42:22.636
for your people
as well as mine.

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:25.556
If I would have
told you everything,

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:27.808
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

01:42:27.891 --> 01:42:29.476
My friends

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:33.313
let me make my own choices.

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:35.315
If it was a mistake,

01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:37.484
you have my deepest apologies.

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:40.904
Why are you here now?

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:43.490
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:44.825
The Anomaleum
draws its current

01:42:44.908 --> 01:42:46.243
from Trinity alone now.

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.495
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.581
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:52.457
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

01:42:52.541 --> 01:42:53.834
He's convinced the authorities

01:42:53.917 --> 01:42:55.878
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

01:42:57.004 --> 01:42:58.922
And why would he say that?

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:02.092
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:07.222
Faced with returning
to your pod

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:10.100
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.476
What would you choose, Neo?

01:43:12.561 --> 01:43:13.854
I'll go back.

01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:17.774
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:20.611
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.362
After you escaped,

01:43:22.446 --> 01:43:25.282
he should have
accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:28.243
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:30.245
that now exists before us.

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:33.832
A few hours ago,

01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:37.210
no one would have been able
to convince me

01:43:37.294 --> 01:43:41.590
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

01:43:41.673 --> 01:43:43.634
as crazy as this one.

01:43:47.429 --> 01:43:49.056

-Volunteering.
-Oh, no.

You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:56.980
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.732
'cause I'm volunteering.

01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:03.654
I need two more.

Are you out of your minds?

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.955
You don't even know
what it is.

01:44:13.038 --> 01:44:15.958
General, we know you.

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:17.250
If you say this is important,

choosing to stay home.

The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:10.929
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

01:45:11.013 --> 01:45:13.056
So, stealth will be paramount.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.891
As long as we raise no alarms,

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:17.060
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.395
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,

of Sentinels?

That's the easy part?

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:26.653
Exactly so.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:29.072
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

01:45:29.156 --> 01:45:30.824

Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

01:48:00.348 --> 01:48:02.017
it's not strictly necessary.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:06.021
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

01:48:06.104 --> 01:48:09.399
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:10.859
in all probability, kill her.

01:48:10.942 --> 01:48:13.486
But even if it is
what she wants,

01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:17.240
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:18.825
He will.

01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:21.369
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:22.412
Why?

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.122
Because we'll already be gone.

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:27.751
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.252
there has to be a reason why.

01:48:31.463 --> 01:48:32.672
When my father realized

01:48:32.756 --> 01:48:35.008
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

01:48:35.091 --> 01:48:38.553
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

01:48:38.637 --> 01:48:41.139
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:43.099
and had my parents purged.

01:48:44.267 --> 01:48:45.644
[inhales sharply]

01:48:45.727 --> 01:48:48.730
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

01:48:51.775 --> 01:48:55.779
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:58.990
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:03.703
[door unlocks, opens]

01:49:07.082 --> 01:49:08.625
We're coming up on broadcast.

01:49:11.211 --> 01:49:15.215
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:21.096
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

01:49:23.306 --> 01:49:26.726
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:29.437
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:31.064
What if we're too late?

01:49:32.857 --> 01:49:34.567
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:37.654
[sighs]

01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.742
I never believed
I was The One.

01:49:43.618 --> 01:49:45.036
But she did.

01:49:46.079 --> 01:49:47.706
She believed in me.

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:52.585
It's my turn
to believe in her.

01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:54.713
[sighs]

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:58.967
[suspenseful music playing]

01:50:17.569 --> 01:50:19.487
[Sati] This is
where it gets tricky.

01:50:30.623 --> 01:50:33.043
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

01:50:33.752 --> 01:50:34.836
Not yet.

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.425
[suspenseful music builds]

01:50:56.566 --> 01:50:57.901
Here we go.

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.903
[suspenseful music continues]

01:51:15.543 --> 01:51:17.462
Welcome home.

01:51:17.545 --> 01:51:19.923
All I want is to talk to her.

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:21.633
Do you mean Tiff?

01:51:21.716 --> 01:51:24.469
Come back,
and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

01:51:24.552 --> 01:51:25.929
I mean, handsome Chad

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:27.472
may have something
to say about it.

01:51:27.555 --> 01:51:30.850
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.228
you win.

01:51:33.311 --> 01:51:34.437
Really?

01:51:34.521 --> 01:51:37.273
But if she wants me,

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:39.192
then you'll let us go free.

01:51:39.275 --> 01:51:42.028
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

01:51:42.112 --> 01:51:44.906
Right now,
I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

01:51:44.989 --> 01:51:47.992
before they'll let you
take me back.

01:51:48.076 --> 01:51:50.120
If you want this Matrix,

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:51.746
this is your only chance.

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:54.791
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:58.211
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:01.798
[suspenseful music playing]

01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:25.488
Okay.

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.073
I like tests.

01:52:27.949 --> 01:52:29.742
We'll let Tiff decide.

01:52:29.826 --> 01:52:31.578
[electricity crackling]

01:52:43.506 --> 01:52:44.924
[Sati breathing heavily]

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:48.261
That's it.

01:52:49.471 --> 01:52:51.014
Bypass is ready.

01:52:51.097 --> 01:52:52.807
Now what?

01:52:52.891 --> 01:52:54.142
We wait.

01:52:54.225 --> 01:52:56.186
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:57.854
and leave her here?

01:52:57.937 --> 01:53:00.607
We must abide by her decision.

01:53:00.690 --> 01:53:02.275
And if she says no,

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:04.569
what happens to Neo?

01:53:04.652 --> 01:53:05.862
At this time,

01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:08.781
the most important choice
of Neo's life

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:10.366
is not his to make.

01:53:17.373 --> 01:53:19.626
[slow suspenseful
music playing]

01:53:41.397 --> 01:53:43.191
I saw this in my dream.

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:48.112
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:50.365
The Oracle.

01:53:50.448 --> 01:53:52.116
From your game?

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:56.246
It's not a game.

01:53:58.373 --> 01:53:59.582
Oh, God.

01:54:04.337 --> 01:54:05.755
[Tiffany sighs]

01:54:07.048 --> 01:54:10.468
After you left, I went home

01:54:10.552 --> 01:54:12.262
and I played it.

01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:17.100
I kept thinking,

01:54:17.183 --> 01:54:20.520
why does this story
feel like a memory?

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:29.445
There's a part of me

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:35.243
that feels like
I have been waiting
my whole life for you.

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:40.456
And that part is like,

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:44.252
"What the hell
took you so long?" [sniffles]

01:54:44.335 --> 01:54:46.379
I don't have an easy answer.

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:50.717
Maybe I was afraid of this.

01:54:52.176 --> 01:54:54.053
Afraid of what might happen.

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:58.558
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

01:55:00.268 --> 01:55:03.813
I wish I was
who you think I am.

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:06.774
But look at me.

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.236
I can't be her.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.447
-[Donnie] Mom!
-[Brandon] Mom! Come on.

01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:13.781
-Mom!
-It's Callie.

01:55:13.865 --> 01:55:14.866
Is this real?

01:55:14.949 --> 01:55:16.117
[Donnie]
You have to come with us.

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.577
[Brandon] Come on,
we gotta go.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.162
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

01:55:19.245 --> 01:55:20.580
but I'm glad we found you.

01:55:20.663 --> 01:55:21.956
-She got hit by a car!
-I know, it's crazy.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:23.166
She was chasing after you.

01:55:23.249 --> 01:55:24.584
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:26.044
[Chad] Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

01:55:26.127 --> 01:55:27.920
[Donnie] You have to come
with us to the hospital.

01:55:28.004 --> 01:55:29.088
It's too late.

01:55:29.172 --> 01:55:30.381
I understand.

-Tiff, come on, let's go.
-[Donnie] Come on.

01:55:38.806 --> 01:55:39.891
What's happening?

to come with us.

Tiffany! [echoing]

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:32.694
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

01:56:32.777 --> 01:56:34.320
I hate that name.

My name is Trinity

01:56:37.448 --> 01:56:39.826
and you better
take your hands off of me.

I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

so easy to control.

I can let you two go free.

01:57:24.162 --> 01:57:25.621
Cannot happen.

So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:31.422
What's wrong?

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:34.633

[Lexy grunting]

02:05:37.655 --> 02:05:39.448
Jack me in.

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:41.575
I can get you in.
I don't know
if I can get you out.

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:49.250
-No!

02:06:02.596 --> 02:06:03.722
What are they doing?

02:06:07.768 --> 02:06:09.436
Herding them into a kill zone.

02:08:07.137 --> 02:08:08.847
Lex.

02:08:08.931 --> 02:08:10.808
-Bugsy.
-Hell yeah!

02:08:11.767 --> 02:08:13.394
Seq, where's Neo?

02:08:13.477 --> 02:08:15.104
It's bad. They're pinned.

02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:16.271
Heading to a roof.

02:08:28.575 --> 02:08:30.077

Nodal fibrillation

It's so beautiful.

02:10:27.236 --> 02:10:28.946
I remember this.

02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:33.242
I remember us.

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.345
My dream ended here.

02:11:04.231 --> 02:11:05.816
We can't go back.

02:11:07.943 --> 02:11:09.027
We won't.

[evocative music playing]

02:11:28.297 --> 02:11:29.673

02:12:00.746 --> 02:12:02.372
I'm not doing this.

02:12:02.456 --> 02:12:03.832
Are you doing this?

02:12:06.001 --> 02:12:07.544
[dramatic music playing]

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:20.641
[helicopter hovering]

[suspenseful music playing]

02:13:50.063 --> 02:13:51.648
How dramatic.

02:13:52.482 --> 02:13:53.775
"Tiffany"?

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.820
[chuckles]
It was a private joke.

02:13:56.903 --> 02:13:58.447
An amusement, that's all.

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:00.866
An amusement? Hmm.

02:14:00.949 --> 02:14:02.534
[flesh tears]

02:14:02.617 --> 02:14:04.786
-[softly] Whoa.
-[groaning]

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:06.288
Kind of like that?

[chokes]

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:13.295
Okay. Ow.

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:14.838
If you hated the name so much,

02:14:14.921 --> 02:14:17.090
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.471
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

-[snaps fingers]
-[The Analyst groaning]

02:14:27.768 --> 02:14:29.728

Can't you control her?

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.107
[groaning]

02:14:35.567 --> 02:14:37.277
That was for using children.

02:14:42.157 --> 02:14:43.658
We have a few questions.

02:14:43.742 --> 02:14:45.577
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:46.995
The Suits tried.

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:49.372
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

02:14:49.456 --> 02:14:50.832
I knew that was impossible.

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:53.126
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

02:14:54.002 --> 02:14:56.671
Because I know the system.

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:59.174
I know human beings.

02:14:59.257 --> 02:15:01.426
And I know you.

02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:03.762
[bones crack, sighs]

02:15:03.845 --> 02:15:06.389
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

02:15:06.473 --> 02:15:08.892
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

02:15:09.726 --> 02:15:11.061
Now what?

02:15:11.144 --> 02:15:13.772
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

02:15:13.855 --> 02:15:15.440
You think you hold
all the cards,

02:15:15.524 --> 02:15:17.943
because you can do
whatever you want
in this world.

02:15:18.026 --> 02:15:20.362
I say, go for it.

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:23.031
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

02:15:23.114 --> 02:15:25.158
Paint the sky with rainbows.

02:15:25.242 --> 02:15:26.409
But here's the thing.

02:15:26.493 --> 02:15:29.538
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

02:15:29.621 --> 02:15:30.831
They like my world.

02:15:30.914 --> 02:15:33.834
They don't want
this sentimentality.

02:15:33.917 --> 02:15:35.836
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

02:15:35.919 --> 02:15:38.338
They want to be controlled.

02:15:38.421 --> 02:15:40.382
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

02:15:40.465 --> 02:15:43.218
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

02:15:43.301 --> 02:15:46.847
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

02:15:48.765 --> 02:15:51.017
[both chuckle]

02:15:51.101 --> 02:15:53.812
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

02:15:53.895 --> 02:15:56.147
We were on our way
to remake your world.

02:15:56.231 --> 02:15:57.774
Change a few things.

02:15:57.858 --> 02:15:59.067
I kind of like

02:15:59.150 --> 02:16:00.485
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

02:16:00.569 --> 02:16:02.487
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

02:16:02.571 --> 02:16:04.072
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

02:16:04.155 --> 02:16:06.575
-He makes it easy.
-That, he does.

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:08.869
Something he should
think about.

02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:11.079
Before we got started,

02:16:11.162 --> 02:16:13.999
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

02:16:14.082 --> 02:16:17.168
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

02:16:17.252 --> 02:16:18.628
And what is that?

02:16:19.504 --> 02:16:21.298
Another chance.

02:16:21.381 --> 02:16:23.300
[punk rock music playing]

02:27:24.544 --> 02:27:27.338
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

02:27:27.421 --> 02:27:29.340
Games are dead.

02:27:29.423 --> 02:27:31.175
Narrative? Dead.

02:27:31.259 --> 02:27:33.219
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

02:27:33.302 --> 02:27:34.512
and viral conditioning.

02:27:34.595 --> 02:27:36.097
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:40.184
Cat videos.

02:27:40.268 --> 02:27:44.021
What we need is
a series of videos

02:27:44.105 --> 02:27:46.440
that we call "The Catrix."
