00:02.158 --> 00:04.425
[panting]
Please, someone help me!

00:04.460 --> 00:07.228
Can anyone hear me?!
Please!

00:07.997 --> 00:10.398
Save me!
Someone please help me!

00:10.433 --> 00:14.201
- I'm on my way, ma'am!
- As fast as you can!

00:16.239 --> 00:17.938
I'll fly at the speed of light.

00:17.974 --> 00:21.042
No one should treat
such a beautiful woman

00:21.077 --> 00:22.376
to such evil.

00:22.412 --> 00:25.813
What are you waiting for,
my Caped Crusader?

00:25.848 --> 00:27.114
I will soon show you.

00:30.319 --> 00:34.789
Save me,
and I'll reward your bravery,

00:34.824 --> 00:38.259
you big, strong Superman.

00:38.894 --> 00:41.295
Baby?

00:43.733 --> 00:45.266
Ronald, is everything okay?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

00:58.347 --> 01:00.081
Wanna go see a movie?

01:00.116 --> 01:02.416
<i>We could go to the one that
tells the story without words,</i>

01:02.452 --> 01:03.918
where everyone communicates

01:03.953 --> 01:06.220
through facial expression
and movement.

01:06.255 --> 01:09.790
- "Blank stare"?
- Yeah, I was thinking more "really quiet,"

01:09.826 --> 01:11.459
but I'm sure you're right.

01:11.494 --> 01:12.927
It did get great reviews.

01:12.962 --> 01:16.163
It did! Right?
And when you were reading them,

01:16.199 --> 01:18.132
I-I know I heard you say the words

01:18.167 --> 01:21.368
"transcendent" and "evocative."

01:21.404 --> 01:26.173
And I remember your response
was "boring" and "boring."

01:26.209 --> 01:27.975
Well, that was last week.

01:28.010 --> 01:30.010
You know,
before you and Jack broke up.

01:30.046 --> 01:34.415
I... would love to see that film
this week.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.884
Maybe you should go on your own
and tell me how it is.

01:36.919 --> 01:41.288
And leave you?
Absolutely not.

01:41.624 --> 01:45.426
- We could go hiking?
- Mnh.

01:45.461 --> 01:48.329
- Gardner museum?
- Mnh.

01:48.364 --> 01:53.300
Strolling...
on the promenade?

01:53.336 --> 01:55.002
Like French people?

01:57.073 --> 01:59.073
Jane, it's okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:59.108 --> 02:01.208
You will, as soon as I find
the right activity.

02:01.933 --> 02:05.179
Ooh!
What about a murder?

02:05.214 --> 02:07.114
Yes! Murder! Mm!

02:07.150 --> 02:11.050
- Huh? Rizzoli.
- Isles.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.419
At least it will keep me
from thinking about

02:12.455 --> 02:14.555
how everything good in life
turns to dust.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.056
Thattagirl.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.525
Except we are going to
a crime scene ...

02:17.560 --> 02:20.461
- Okay, and we're walking. We're walking.
- Uh...

02:20.496 --> 02:22.325
Yes. Go, go, go.

02:37.562 --> 02:40.368
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

02:41.306 --> 02:44.087
<b>5x18 - "Family Matters"</b>

02:46.189 --> 02:48.088
It's a plant.
The ancient Romans used it

02:48.124 --> 02:49.957
as a natural form of birth control.

02:49.992 --> 02:52.293
I'm just saying, it's
a terrible name for a hotel ...

02:52.328 --> 02:56.163
"Silphium Suites" ...
even if it does conjure up images

02:56.199 --> 03:00.000
of people in togas
safely having naked orgies.

03:00.036 --> 03:01.368
You can't have
naked orgies if you ...

03:01.404 --> 03:03.070
I know. It didn't make sense
as soon as I said it.

03:03.105 --> 03:05.940
I realize that. But it's just
a terrible name for a hotel.

03:05.975 --> 03:08.309
You know, uh, the silphium
seed pod was heart-shaped,

03:08.344 --> 03:11.245
which is why the symbol
is now associated with love.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.913
It works on many levels.

03:12.949 --> 03:14.381
Still doesn't roll off the tongue.

03:16.152 --> 03:19.386
Excessive use of the plant
drove it into extinction.

03:19.422 --> 03:23.057
- You really miss Jack, don't you?
- So much.

03:28.431 --> 03:30.865
Are you doing the screening of
"The three stooges" later?

03:30.900 --> 03:32.533
Guard hung it up before we got here.

03:37.974 --> 03:39.406
- Is she alive?
- Yeah.

03:39.442 --> 03:41.575
Then I'll take a look
at our actual victim.

03:41.611 --> 03:43.944
Our victim is Ronald Wallace.
That's his wife Linda.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.280
Her screams got the attention
of a guest, who called security.

03:46.315 --> 03:49.216
- Guard opened the door.
- Our keys don't open those handcuffs?

03:49.252 --> 03:50.651
No, they're British.

03:50.686 --> 03:52.319
<i>She was blindfolded when
they came into the room.</i>

03:52.355 --> 03:53.988
<i>Got more hysterical when
he tried to remove it.</i>

03:54.023 --> 03:55.256
Paramedic thought she might
hurt herself on the cuffs,

03:55.291 --> 03:58.392
- so he sedated her.
- When is she gonna wake up?

03:58.427 --> 04:00.561
Couple hours minimum, depending
on how much she had to drink.

04:00.596 --> 04:03.964
Front desk told me the
couple stayed here often.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.399
This time, they arrived separately.

04:05.434 --> 04:08.035
They were both given cards.
Both cards were used.

04:08.070 --> 04:10.037
And silphium is a plant.

04:10.072 --> 04:12.172
What a stupid thing
to name a hotel after.

04:12.208 --> 04:15.509
- It's a sex plant.
- Better, but still...

04:15.544 --> 04:16.911
Frankie, can you check
with housekeeping?

04:16.946 --> 04:19.480
See when they cleaned the room
and if they noticed anything usual.

04:19.515 --> 04:20.915
- Will do.
- Thanks.

04:20.950 --> 04:25.152
It appears that our victim suffered
a significant blow to the head.

04:25.187 --> 04:26.487
Mm. Like from the footboard?

04:26.522 --> 04:30.190
The head wound is differentiated,
which would be...

04:30.226 --> 04:32.693
consistent with an
uneven object like that.

04:32.728 --> 04:35.162
And I do see a dried, dark
substance on the surface,

04:35.197 --> 04:38.198
but I can't be sure until after autopsy.

04:40.236 --> 04:43.570
Mm, maybe Batman slipped
when he tried to fly in

04:43.606 --> 04:45.472
and save his mistress in distress.

04:45.508 --> 04:47.207
Batman didn't fly.

04:47.243 --> 04:50.044
Well, he... leapt great distances

04:50.079 --> 04:54.114
in a... bat-like and heroic manner.

04:54.150 --> 04:57.284
Yes, but that's not flying.
Not like Superman.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.019
Let's track down the security guard.

04:59.055 --> 05:02.156
Maybe the wife said something
before she started screaming.

05:02.191 --> 05:03.624
Why did Superman fly?

05:03.659 --> 05:05.492
Because of the stronger
gravitational pull

05:05.528 --> 05:09.163
on his home planet of Krypton,
Earth's gravity had no affect on him.

05:09.198 --> 05:12.232
Well, then why didn't
he fly all the time?

05:12.268 --> 05:14.368
I have no idea.

05:22.445 --> 05:23.711
Doctor at the hospital said

05:23.746 --> 05:25.646
that the wife is still
extremely agitated.

05:25.681 --> 05:29.450
- That's not surprising.
- They're keeping her mildly sedated,

05:29.485 --> 05:31.118
but she's due to be
released this afternoon.

05:31.153 --> 05:32.586
Maybe we can talk to her then.

05:32.621 --> 05:34.588
Look what C.S.R.U. found
when the E.M.T.S moved her.

05:34.623 --> 05:37.291
- Where was it?
- Between the mattress and the bed frame.

05:37.326 --> 05:38.726
Why put it there?

05:38.761 --> 05:41.286
So it doesn't get lost
during the festivities.

05:42.298 --> 05:47.534
Or so I hear.
Anyway... Ronald Wallace was 39.

05:47.570 --> 05:49.269
A real estate developer.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.638
He and his wife have been
married 15 years. No children.

05:51.674 --> 05:54.141
Any criminal record or
outstanding warrants?

05:54.176 --> 05:57.511
No, but he does have a habit
of making large cash withdrawals

05:57.546 --> 05:59.113
from his corporate accounts.

05:59.148 --> 06:00.681
Any corresponding deposits
to personal accounts?

06:00.716 --> 06:02.516
No. He also doesn't
pay his bills in person.

06:02.551 --> 06:04.151
The money wasn't hidden in the house,

06:04.186 --> 06:07.554
and there's no safety deposit box ...
at least none we've found.

06:07.590 --> 06:09.590
So if he was murdered,
maybe we've got a motive.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.358
And if he wasn't murdered?

06:11.394 --> 06:14.861
We got a big pile of money
that really isn't our business.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.067
Find any Kryptonite?

06:20.102 --> 06:21.735
Mm, he clearly wasn't dressed
as Superman.

06:21.771 --> 06:26.040
- Don't let her bait you.
- Maura, you're spoiling all my fun.

06:26.075 --> 06:28.409
Okay, then just for the
record, no Kryptonite.

06:28.444 --> 06:30.644
The cause of death
was blunt force trauma.

06:30.679 --> 06:34.148
But given the force of the blow
against the stationary footboard,

06:34.183 --> 06:36.450
there should have been some
sort of contrecoup injury

06:36.485 --> 06:38.519
to the other opposite
side of the victim's head.

06:38.554 --> 06:40.120
- But there wasn't?
- No.

06:40.156 --> 06:44.324
The skull fracture requires
500 pounds of force.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.326
This one might've required more.

06:46.362 --> 06:49.463
And since
force = mass x acceleration ...

06:49.498 --> 06:51.098
This is physics, isn't it?

06:51.133 --> 06:53.480
- Yes.
- Well, can I just sneak out

06:53.505 --> 06:55.569
the backdoor and go to the little
girls' room like I did in high school?

06:55.604 --> 06:57.237
Oh, I didn't know you took
physics in high school.

06:57.273 --> 07:01.608
Well... Mark Roberts
was a very cute, very smart boy.

07:01.644 --> 07:05.446
- And what happened to Mark Roberts?
- He failed physics.

07:05.481 --> 07:08.182
What? It wasn't my fault.

07:08.217 --> 07:09.850
It was totally my fault.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.754
Anyway, for the stationary footboard

07:13.789 --> 07:16.223
to create that wound
in our victim's skull,

07:16.258 --> 07:20.461
he would either "a," had
to have fallen 18 stories,

07:20.496 --> 07:23.363
"b," have a head that
weighs 5,500 pounds,

07:23.399 --> 07:26.400
"c," have flown into the footboard
at 120 miles an hour,

07:26.435 --> 07:29.103
or "d," some variable
combination of these factors.

07:29.138 --> 07:31.171
Well, I didn't get any
credit for that physics class,

07:31.207 --> 07:32.539
but I'm guessing by
the tone of your voice

07:32.575 --> 07:34.308
that none of these things happened.

07:34.343 --> 07:38.445
- No.
- So he was murdered.

07:38.481 --> 07:40.747
- The Caped Crusader has a nemesis.
- Yes.

07:40.783 --> 07:43.217
<i>Or nemesi.</i>

07:43.252 --> 07:44.852
That isn't the plural of "nemesis."

07:44.887 --> 07:47.387
It doesn't matter.
He's not a real superhero.

07:56.387 --> 07:59.155
Thank you.

07:59.190 --> 08:01.357
Thank you for coming in.

08:03.161 --> 08:05.361
Ronald traveled so much.

08:05.396 --> 08:07.963
He just liked to go to the
hotel every couple of weeks

08:07.999 --> 08:09.265
and have a little fun.

08:09.300 --> 08:12.802
You know, just ... just pretend.
I wish...

08:14.038 --> 08:16.339
he wouldn't have wanted to...
die like that.

08:16.374 --> 08:18.307
We're handling everything
with the utmost discretion.

08:18.343 --> 08:20.776
Of course. You've all
been so nice and...

08:22.947 --> 08:24.613
I'm sorry.

08:24.649 --> 08:25.948
I thought I was gonna be
able to talk about this,

08:25.983 --> 08:27.883
but I don't know if I can.

08:27.919 --> 08:29.218
Well, we just have a few questions,

08:29.253 --> 08:30.886
and then we'll get you home, okay?

08:30.922 --> 08:34.890
- Okay.
- Did Ronald have a drug problem?

08:34.926 --> 08:37.927
- No.
- Did he owe money to anyone?

08:37.962 --> 08:39.794
No. Why ...
Why would you think that?

08:39.831 --> 08:42.030
There were large cash
withdrawals from his accounts.

08:42.066 --> 08:44.166
We're just trying to figure
out where that money went.

08:44.202 --> 08:47.169
Well, he was in real estate development.

08:47.205 --> 08:49.905
Contractors like to be paid in cash.

08:49.941 --> 08:53.743
- Was the window open in your hotel room?
- I-I don't know.

08:53.778 --> 08:57.113
Before Ronald died,
did you hear anything?

08:57.148 --> 08:59.816
- Like what?
- Is it possible that someone

08:59.817 --> 09:00.783
else was in the room with you?

09:00.818 --> 09:05.187
What are you saying?
That this wasn't an accident?

09:05.223 --> 09:07.189
We suspect that Ronald was murdered.

09:07.225 --> 09:12.695
Someone was...
there?

09:12.730 --> 09:17.032
- Oh, my god.
- Did you hear anyone?

09:17.068 --> 09:19.435
No. The ... the music was so loud.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.871
Can you think of anything
that might help us?

09:25.143 --> 09:27.176
There was a note.

09:27.211 --> 09:29.812
- What did it say?
- I don't know.

09:29.847 --> 09:32.114
It was slipped under
the door at our home.

09:32.150 --> 09:34.683
It was addressed to Ron.

09:34.719 --> 09:39.455
He read it, he ... he folded it up,
he put it back in his pocket.

09:39.490 --> 09:42.597
I could tell he was upset.
But he just said that

09:42.710 --> 09:44.960
the real estate deal had gone
South, not to worry about it.

09:44.996 --> 09:47.163
- When was this?
- It was a month ago.

09:47.198 --> 09:49.698
There were phone calls, too.

09:49.734 --> 09:52.234
A few of them. Hang-ups.

09:52.270 --> 09:55.171
But then they stopped.

09:59.410 --> 10:01.243
I went through our
victim's cell phone records.

10:01.279 --> 10:03.846
There were a lot of calls
from a guy named Larry Price.

10:03.881 --> 10:06.849
He and Ron had a partnership
that broke up last year.

10:06.884 --> 10:08.984
- They sued each other.
- He write the note?

10:09.020 --> 10:12.354
He says no.
They settled out of court six weeks ago,

10:12.390 --> 10:14.990
and he has an airtight alibi
for the day of the murder.

10:15.026 --> 10:17.092
So far, it's not a very
promising line of investigation.

10:17.128 --> 10:20.729
The partnership broke up
because Ron made Larry nervous.

10:20.765 --> 10:22.865
He refused meat and potatoes jobs.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.268
He was only interested in
high risk/high return projects.

10:26.304 --> 10:29.405
- He was a gambler.
- I asked if Ron had a gambling problem.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.973
Larry said that he
would've bet on how long

10:31.008 --> 10:32.842
it would take a cockroach
to crawl under the sink.

10:32.877 --> 10:34.410
And if he lost,
if would've doubled down

10:34.445 --> 10:36.178
on how long it would take the
cockroach to come back out.

10:36.214 --> 10:37.880
Well, maybe our vic got in
deep with the wrong person.

10:37.915 --> 10:41.150
- See if you can find out who that was.
- Yeah.

10:42.384 --> 10:44.370
Hey, Gwen told me you
made the honor roll.

10:44.405 --> 10:48.074
- Everyone makes the honor roll.
- Well, I don't think that's true.

10:48.109 --> 10:50.276
I just mean everyone
who stays conscious,

10:50.311 --> 10:52.311
does their homework, and
manages to resist the urge

10:52.347 --> 10:54.680
to let the air out of
their teacher's car tires.

10:54.716 --> 10:56.215
High five.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.885
Kids don't let the air out
of the teachers'... tires.

11:01.022 --> 11:02.388
They do?

11:02.423 --> 11:04.390
Well, where am I supposed
to learn these things?

11:04.425 --> 11:08.627
- Did you hear back from the colleges?
- Princeton.

11:08.663 --> 11:09.895
I didn't get in.

11:09.931 --> 11:13.232
No surprise.
My interview got a little bogged down

11:13.267 --> 11:16.669
in the "how I got shot
while homeless" questions.

11:16.704 --> 11:19.038
Seemed to make them uncomfortable.

11:19.073 --> 11:23.642
I applied to a bunch of schools.
Still waiting to hear back...

11:23.678 --> 11:27.780
- including B.C.U.
- I didn't know you were applying there!

11:27.815 --> 11:29.048
You know, I know
people on the committee.

11:29.083 --> 11:32.318
- I can make a call for you.
- That's a really nice offer,

11:32.353 --> 11:34.954
but I wanna go where I'm wanted.

11:34.989 --> 11:38.657
And if you call them,
then it's not about me.

11:38.693 --> 11:42.899
I should go wash my hands before
I dig in to these potato skins.

11:45.099 --> 11:48.167
Jane, we have to convince
her to let me make the call.

11:48.202 --> 11:50.704
- No, we don't.
- College admissions reward

11:50.705 --> 11:52.322
many things other than merit,
and Tasha

11:52.323 --> 11:53.939
should use any advantage she has.

11:53.975 --> 11:55.674
But she's decided not to do that.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.676
- But maybe she ...
- So we're going to accept that.

11:57.712 --> 11:59.632
- But what if she ...
- Because she's going

11:59.633 --> 12:00.913
to get in someplace great.

12:00.948 --> 12:04.183
So... now let's figure out
more things that we can do

12:04.218 --> 12:06.185
that will cheer you up. Hmm?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.687
- Beanpot hockey tournament.
- No.

12:08.723 --> 12:10.890
Visiting bass at the zoo.

12:10.925 --> 12:13.292
- A jewish music festival.
- No.

12:13.327 --> 12:16.095
What would cheer me up is
getting Tasha into B.C.U.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.696
Jewish music festival it is.

12:17.732 --> 12:20.833
- Klezmer gives me a headache.
- Or not.

12:20.868 --> 12:23.269
Hmm.

12:23.304 --> 12:27.039
So are we dating anyone?

12:27.074 --> 12:30.075
Tasha, I'm a cop.
Do tell us about Michael.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.917
Korsak texted me.
Did you find anything

12:37.952 --> 12:40.152
to support your
out-of-control gambler theory?

12:40.188 --> 12:43.189
- I didn't. She did.
- I was tracking his cell phone,

12:43.224 --> 12:45.124
and I noticed on the dates he
took out the big cash deposits,

12:45.159 --> 12:47.760
<i>his phone would move around
the greater Boston area.</i>

12:47.795 --> 12:49.395
<i>No pattern I could find.</i>

12:49.430 --> 12:52.465
Then the phone would
head towards Connecticut,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.467
and...

12:54.502 --> 12:56.368
- What just happened?
- He took his phone offline.

12:56.404 --> 12:58.270
- Why?
- No idea, but...

12:58.306 --> 12:59.872
Every time it happened,

12:59.907 --> 13:01.273
<i>a different number would
ping off the same tower</i>

13:01.309 --> 13:02.975
<i>almost immediately.</i>

13:03.010 --> 13:05.811
- So Ronald has another phone.
- Looks that way.

13:05.847 --> 13:07.746
- Is it registered to him?
- Not that we've found yet.

13:07.782 --> 13:11.283
But that second phone always traveled
to a rural region of Connecticut.

13:11.319 --> 13:13.953
Stays there a few days,
then heads back to Boston.

13:13.988 --> 13:16.322
When it shuts off, then
the other phone reactivates.

13:16.357 --> 13:18.858
Is there anything in
that part of Connecticut?

13:18.893 --> 13:20.426
The Mattatuck Casino.

13:20.461 --> 13:21.994
So maybe Ronald did
have a gambling problem

13:22.029 --> 13:25.097
- that followed him home.
- Want me to call the casino?

13:25.132 --> 13:27.900
No.
They're a state licensed business.

13:27.935 --> 13:29.869
If whatever happened there
reflects badly on them,

13:29.904 --> 13:32.471
- they won't be helpful.
- So what do we do?

13:37.812 --> 13:40.079
Hey. You still keep
that overnight bag packed

13:40.114 --> 13:42.294
- and at the office?
- Yes.

13:42.329 --> 13:44.607
You never know when you'll
need a change of clothes

13:44.608 --> 13:46.886
because of some corpse's
gaseous liver explosion.

13:46.921 --> 13:49.788
- Exactly. Come on.
- Where?

13:49.824 --> 13:51.490
We're going on a road trip.
Come on!

13:52.491 --> 13:53.891
Oh.

13:59.847 --> 14:01.880
And then I realized that the casino

14:01.915 --> 14:04.315
is right next to that spa you mentioned.

14:04.351 --> 14:07.051
- The Awuc Transcendence Center?
- Yep.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.486
The one with the sweat lodge?

14:08.522 --> 14:10.889
The one I asked you
to go to six weeks ago?

14:10.924 --> 14:12.801
- Yep.
- After everything that you've

14:12.809 --> 14:15.793
been through with losing Frost,
losing the baby,

14:15.829 --> 14:18.429
I thought it would be a good
and healing experience for you?

14:18.465 --> 14:20.226
- Yeah.
- And you said you'd rather

14:20.331 --> 14:22.200
put forks in your eyes than go?

14:22.235 --> 14:24.235
Yeah, we're talking
about the same place.

14:24.271 --> 14:25.803
What are you working on?

14:25.839 --> 14:29.173
Uh, just having trouble
with this CAD/CAM program.

14:29.209 --> 14:31.442
I'm using the x-ray of the
wound from the victim's skull

14:31.478 --> 14:36.074
- to try to identify a murder weapon.
- Hmm. Find the murderer

14:36.109 --> 14:36.948
- through the weapon.
- # Sunrise #

14:36.983 --> 14:39.951
It seemed like a great idea,
except every time I run the analysis,

14:39.986 --> 14:43.521
it keeps telling me that the
murder weapon was the footboard.

14:43.557 --> 14:45.223
But physics has already
proven that not to be true,

14:45.258 --> 14:47.225
so I must've loaded the data wrong.

14:47.260 --> 14:50.495
- Mm, you'll figure it out.
- Yes, I will.

14:50.530 --> 14:54.232
Later, 'cause I brought a mix tape!

14:54.267 --> 14:56.234
<i>- # I've been hoping you would find me
- # thanks, Jane.</i>

14:56.269 --> 14:58.236
- It's gonna be great.
- For both of us.

Hello, Detective Vince.

15:37.911 --> 15:40.411
Hi, Judith. How'd your
husband's surgery go?

15:40.447 --> 15:42.880
Flying colors, if the
colors are black and blue.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.316
But the doctors
say he's gonna be okay.

15:45.352 --> 15:47.185
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

15:47.220 --> 15:50.421
The food from the
department was very nice.

15:53.493 --> 15:56.327
Detective Frankie Jr.!
I like your haircut.

15:56.363 --> 15:57.662
Thanks, Judith.

15:57.697 --> 15:59.931
I'm headed out, unless
you need help with that.

15:59.966 --> 16:01.499
Oh, no, no, no.
This isn't work.

16:01.534 --> 16:03.167
It's just the results of my
practice lieutenant's exam.

16:03.203 --> 16:05.436
- How'd you do?
- 92%.

16:05.472 --> 16:07.405
Well, last year, didn't
everyone who got better than 89%

16:07.440 --> 16:09.907
- make lieutenant?
- I think so.

16:09.943 --> 16:11.309
Can I take you out for
a beer to celebrate?

16:11.344 --> 16:16.147
- Some other time. Thanks.
- Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

16:19.352 --> 16:22.587
That's a very good score.
Why aren't you happier?

16:23.622 --> 16:26.357
I guess.
It's about what I expected.

16:26.393 --> 16:28.626
You're a bad liar, Detective Vince.

16:35.969 --> 16:38.636
I barely slept last night.
I was so excited!

16:38.672 --> 16:41.472
Yes. Me, too!
I was so excited for you.

16:41.508 --> 16:44.042
<i>Really? You were snoring.</i>

16:44.077 --> 16:46.678
<i>Well, that's how I
hide my sleeplessness.</i>

16:46.713 --> 16:50.381
<i>You know, the concept of ritual
sweating is a global phenomenon.</i>

16:50.417 --> 16:52.583
<i>Everyone always gloms
on to the good ideas.</i>

16:52.619 --> 16:54.185
<i>It isn't always associated</i>

16:54.220 --> 16:56.287
with ceremonial or
mystical significance.

16:56.322 --> 16:57.955
- Turkish baths, for instance.
- Mm.

16:57.991 --> 17:01.359
- What are you gonna do with your gun?
- Nothing.

17:01.394 --> 17:04.362
She needs to check in.
Dr. Maura Isles.

17:04.396 --> 17:06.064
I thought we were
doing this the together!

17:06.098 --> 17:08.465
No. I'm going to go
investigate a murder.

17:08.501 --> 17:12.537
Jane, you said this would be healing.
We both need healing.

17:12.571 --> 17:17.241
And I believe in the...
healing power of crime solving.

17:17.277 --> 17:19.310
- Oh, Jane.
- Maura!

17:19.345 --> 17:22.012
Come on. I know that you're
really gonna love this.

17:22.048 --> 17:25.383
<i>And I know that
I would really not love this.</i>

17:25.417 --> 17:26.718
That's not the reason
that you won't do it.

17:26.752 --> 17:28.686
You're just afraid of
what it will stir up.

17:28.722 --> 17:31.422
I'm not going in because...
Well, I don't need to.

17:31.458 --> 17:34.492
- Okay, the way that I'm processing ...
- You mean not at all?

17:36.463 --> 17:38.129
My way works for me.

17:38.164 --> 17:42.533
Okay? I'm fine.
Maura, I'm totally fine.

17:42.569 --> 17:45.536
Dr. Isles?
If you'll follow me.

17:45.572 --> 17:49.073
Go. Have a good time.
I'll pick you up later.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.642
And we're following and we're walking.

17:51.678 --> 17:56.047
<i>And we're smiling.
And I'm leaving.</i>

17:57.717 --> 18:00.776
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

18:00.954 --> 18:03.421
Well, the casino circulated
that photo you sent me,

18:03.456 --> 18:06.024
and, uh, chief of security
says nobody recognized him.

18:06.059 --> 18:07.689
Is he someone you trust to
be straight with you?

18:07.695 --> 18:10.061
Yes. The casino works hard
to stay on my good side

18:10.096 --> 18:11.329
so I don't make trouble for the folks

18:11.364 --> 18:13.398
who zoom in and out
of there all weekend.

18:13.433 --> 18:16.067
So if your guy's a high roller,
it's not here.

18:16.102 --> 18:17.702
Is there any other trouble in
the area that he could get into?

18:17.737 --> 18:19.170
Well, we're not a big department,

18:19.205 --> 18:21.039
but I feel like we would run into him...

18:21.074 --> 18:22.273
if he were into something sticky.

18:22.308 --> 18:24.208
- Okay. Thank you.
- You bet.

18:24.244 --> 18:26.110
Rizzoli.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.578
<i>Jane, we've struck out connecting</i>

18:27.614 --> 18:29.647
our victim to anything
concrete in Connecticut.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.716
Yeah, no driver's license.
No credit cards.

18:31.751 --> 18:33.384
No real estate transactions.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.987
<i>No utility bills.
The guy's a ghost.</i>

18:36.022 --> 18:38.956
Hang on a second.
Excuse me. Do you recognize him?

18:38.992 --> 18:41.493
Yeah. I don't remember
his name, but he was

18:41.494 --> 18:43.995
in a couple of months ago.
For a gun registration.

18:44.030 --> 18:46.397
Uh, Nina, did you check
Connecticut gun registry?

18:46.433 --> 18:49.100
Yeah. There was nothing.
Let me check again.

18:49.135 --> 18:50.635
Uh, would you be able
to pull up his paperwork?

18:50.670 --> 18:53.271
Sure. It'll take me
a while, but I don't mind.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.106
Thank you.

18:55.141 --> 18:56.607
Alan Wallace.

18:56.643 --> 18:58.743
Should've caught it.
He used his middle name.

18:58.778 --> 19:00.211
Okay. Hang on a second.

19:00.246 --> 19:02.380
Um, thank you. I'm ...
I'm good.

19:02.415 --> 19:05.550
Hey, Nina, get me an address.

19:42.622 --> 19:45.289
<i>Hi. Can I help you?</i>

19:45.325 --> 19:47.442
Yes. Um, I'm Jane Rizzoli.

19:47.443 --> 19:51.129
I'm a detective with Boston P.D.
Uh, do you live here?

19:51.164 --> 19:53.531
- Yes.
- I'm looking for a Ronald Wallace.

19:53.566 --> 19:55.399
You might know him as Alan.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.702
- Alan.
- So you know him?

19:57.737 --> 19:59.937
Yes. He's my husband.

20:07.537 --> 20:10.137
<i>Who gets to plan the funeral? 
Her or me?</i>

20:10.173 --> 20:14.108
I don't know.
When did the two of you get married?

20:14.143 --> 20:16.744
About 18 months ago.

20:16.779 --> 20:20.814
I mean, we ... we dated for
a year before that. We...

20:20.850 --> 20:23.918
We met in a bowling alley.
He was with a client.

20:23.953 --> 20:25.319
What kind of work did he do?

20:25.354 --> 20:30.323
He was a sales rep for
a building supply company.

20:31.260 --> 20:33.794
At least, that's what he told me.

20:33.829 --> 20:35.229
Now did he have any trouble with anyone?

20:35.464 --> 20:38.098
No.

20:38.134 --> 20:42.970
Whenever he came here, he always
brought large amounts of cash.

20:43.005 --> 20:45.005
Do you now if anybody
here knew about that?

20:45.180 --> 20:47.748
That was their money, wasn't it?

20:47.783 --> 20:51.318
- His and his other...
- I'm sorry, Cynthia. I-I don't think

20:51.353 --> 20:53.754
it's appropriate
for me to talk about Ronald...

20:53.789 --> 20:56.290
Alan, um, and his other life.

20:56.325 --> 20:59.126
Everything we were, everything
we did, it was all fake.

20:59.161 --> 21:00.527
None of it means anything.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.763
You could still help
us find who killed him.

21:02.798 --> 21:05.799
How?
I-I don't even know him.

21:05.834 --> 21:08.402
Nothing I know is true.

21:08.437 --> 21:10.304
Oh, god.

21:16.378 --> 21:17.778
Hi.

21:17.813 --> 21:19.880
<i>So she wouldn't stay
focused on my questions.</i>

21:19.915 --> 21:22.583
- Or couldn't. What's her alibi?
- She was home,

21:22.618 --> 21:26.386
alone, 'cause her two-timing
husband was out of town.

21:26.422 --> 21:28.288
Well, if she wrote the note
and made the hang-up calls,

21:28.324 --> 21:30.524
- she knew about the relationship.
- Yeah, which means

21:30.559 --> 21:32.225
she could've also known about
the regular trips to the hotel.

21:32.261 --> 21:33.727
But it still doesn't answer the question

21:33.762 --> 21:35.429
- of how she got in the room.
- It was a first floor room.

21:35.464 --> 21:36.663
It's easy enough to
climb through the window

21:36.699 --> 21:39.800
- left open by housekeeping.
- Or to be let in by housekeeping.

21:39.835 --> 21:42.736
All right, I'll look at the staff again.
Maybe we'll find something.

21:42.771 --> 21:44.671
All right. Well, at least we
figured out his superpower.

21:44.707 --> 21:47.507
- What was it?
- Bigamy.

21:51.880 --> 21:57.317
At first, it was just hot,
and then it was hot and sweaty.

21:57.353 --> 22:00.354
And then I started to smell something.

22:00.389 --> 22:04.558
- Ew.
- No, like, um, a flower.

22:04.593 --> 22:08.562
Or the universe.
And then it was just like... Boom!

22:08.597 --> 22:12.299
- My head just exploded.
- Exploded?

22:12.334 --> 22:14.601
Everything that had
been weighing on me ...

22:14.637 --> 22:18.805
the CAD/CAM program
or Tasha, Jack, you ...

22:18.841 --> 22:22.442
- they all just resolved themselves.
- Aw. They did?

22:22.478 --> 22:24.244
Well, it's not like
they're magically fixed,

22:24.279 --> 22:28.482
but I feel like I just got
some insights and revelations

22:28.517 --> 22:30.651
that would just help me move forward.

22:32.354 --> 22:34.087
You gonna tell me what those are?

22:35.858 --> 22:37.724
- No.
- Are you mad

22:37.760 --> 22:41.228
because I didn't go
sweat and smell with you?

22:41.263 --> 22:43.864
Well, I'm not happy that you
made me think you were going.

22:43.899 --> 22:45.632
Sin of omission, Maura.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.367
And if I hadn't have done it,
you wouldn't have gone.

22:47.403 --> 22:49.670
Maybe.
But I'm not mad.

22:49.705 --> 22:52.773
I think that everything
you said was 100% right.

22:52.808 --> 22:55.509
That Ambrosia is an
underappreciated band?

22:55.544 --> 23:00.013
No. That we all have our own
way of dealing with things.

23:00.049 --> 23:03.884
- But Ambrosia is a wonderful band.
- Right?

23:06.321 --> 23:08.288
<i>Nothing solid from the hotel staff.</i>

23:08.323 --> 23:09.723
No one has a criminal record,

23:09.758 --> 23:11.792
no fingerprints in the
room that shouldn't be.

23:11.827 --> 23:13.326
And the maid who cleans the room

23:13.362 --> 23:14.828
swears she didn't leave the window open.

23:14.863 --> 23:16.530
We haven't made a dent in
Cynthia's alibi, either.

23:16.565 --> 23:18.799
Cell phone stays put.
No movement on her EZ pass.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.834
<i>Can't find her on the cameras
at the train or the bus station</i>

23:20.869 --> 23:22.903
the days before and after the murder.

23:22.938 --> 23:24.438
Can we at least put her around Linda

23:24.439 --> 23:25.939
and Ronald's house at some point?

23:25.974 --> 23:27.474
Not based on her cell
phone or credit cards.

23:27.509 --> 23:28.942
The woman never leaves Connecticut.

23:28.977 --> 23:30.577
I mean, if we had something,

23:30.612 --> 23:32.012
we could take a run at
her, try to break her,

23:32.047 --> 23:34.072
- but we...
- We've got nothing.

23:35.350 --> 23:39.180
Hey, Maura.
Okay.

23:40.656 --> 23:42.089
Okay.

23:42.324 --> 23:43.990
She wants to see all of us.

23:50.365 --> 23:53.433
Oh. We here
for a self-defense seminar?

23:53.469 --> 23:54.835
No, you're here to see one of the fruits

23:54.870 --> 23:57.070
of my sweat lodge revelations.

23:57.106 --> 24:00.440
I'd been struggling with this
CAD/CAM program I'd been using.

24:00.476 --> 24:02.342
It kept indicating that our victim Ron

24:02.377 --> 24:04.044
was killed by the footboard of the bed,

24:04.079 --> 24:06.546
even though the physics
of that made it impossible.

24:06.582 --> 24:12.319
But in the sweat lodge,
I realized that the program was right.

24:12.354 --> 24:14.354
Oh, it's the same
pattern as the footboard.

24:14.389 --> 24:17.457
Virtually.
I used a 3-D rendering

24:17.493 --> 24:19.860
to have it laser-carved
out of a piece of wood

24:19.895 --> 24:22.863
- at a shop down the street.
- Oh. Go, sweat lodge.

24:22.898 --> 24:26.733
So something like this
might be our murder weapon.

24:26.769 --> 24:29.402
- Might be?
- Well, it could generate

24:29.438 --> 24:32.606
the wound pattern on his forehead.
But the question is,

24:32.641 --> 24:34.775
could anyone swing it
hard enough to do so?

24:34.810 --> 24:36.743
So which if you is
the best user of a bat?

24:36.779 --> 24:38.645
Not me.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.880
<i>Jane.</i>

24:39.915 --> 24:43.884
Yes.
I am a good user of the bat.

24:43.919 --> 24:45.352
Great.

24:45.387 --> 24:50.357
So you will need to generate a bat
speed of at least 68 miles per hour.

24:50.392 --> 24:52.359
- Well, that seems fast.
- It is fast.

24:52.394 --> 24:55.395
But if properly placed, should
generate the force necessary.

24:55.430 --> 24:58.532
- Ready, Susie?
- Norm is ready, Detective Rizzoli.

24:58.567 --> 25:01.635
- Norm?
- He's my uncle.

25:01.670 --> 25:03.069
My apologies, Norm.

25:03.105 --> 25:07.407
- Well, he left my aunt for a barista.
- Screw Norm.

25:09.044 --> 25:11.044
- 50.
- Come on!

25:11.079 --> 25:13.079
Well, the curve ball kinda
left you hanging there, Janie.

25:13.115 --> 25:14.915
You wanna step in for Norm, Frankie?

25:20.189 --> 25:23.423
56.

25:23.458 --> 25:26.927
- You got anymore, slugger?
- Not without beer.

25:26.962 --> 25:29.529
Maybe our killer was a man.

25:29.565 --> 25:31.431
<i>Or just a former college all-star.</i>

25:31.466 --> 25:35.535
When I did background on Cynthia,
I read she got a scholarship.

25:35.571 --> 25:36.803
4-year starter.

25:41.577 --> 25:43.009
Well, what do you know?

25:43.045 --> 25:47.035
There is no joy in Mudville.
Mighty Casey has struck out.

25:56.177 --> 25:59.612
Maura calculated the velocity of
Cynthia's swing in that video.

25:59.647 --> 26:01.614
65 miles an hour at point of impact.

26:01.649 --> 26:03.048
Hell, we could use her
on the softball team.

26:03.059 --> 26:05.151
Yeah, except you make a bad
play, maybe she murders you.

26:05.186 --> 26:07.653
Well, there's a big difference
between muffing a ground ball

26:07.689 --> 26:09.755
- and having another wife.
- Maybe.

26:09.791 --> 26:12.591
We need to find the murder weapon
or figure out where she bought it

26:12.627 --> 26:15.628
or placed her in Boston at the time
of the murder, or all of the above.

26:15.663 --> 26:17.997
- Well, I'll get Nina on the research.
- Oh, she's already on it.

26:18.032 --> 26:19.765
I've got a search warrant
in process in Connecticut.

26:19.801 --> 26:21.267
Sheriff will meet you
at Cynthia's house.

26:21.302 --> 26:24.837
- So I'm done eating?
- No, as long as you're also walking.

26:26.274 --> 26:28.040
Hey, take the whole thing.
Bring me the basket later.

26:28.076 --> 26:29.675
I'll call you from Connecticut.

26:29.711 --> 26:32.044
- Bye, Frankie.
- Bye, Ma.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.579
Hey, you want something to eat?

26:33.614 --> 26:35.181
Oh, I had a granola bar
at the vending machine.

26:35.216 --> 26:36.949
Okay, that's not food.

26:36.984 --> 26:39.018
There's a burger ready to come
out. Let me get it for you.

26:39.053 --> 26:40.686
- That's a customer's order.
- Yeah.

26:40.722 --> 26:44.790
But they'll wait and
drink some more beer.

26:44.826 --> 26:48.027
Frankie told me about your, uh,
score on the lieutenant exam.

26:48.062 --> 26:51.030
Congratulations.
When's the real one?

26:51.065 --> 26:53.265
I'm not sure I'm gonna take it.

26:53.301 --> 26:55.952
- Why?
- Do I really wanna finish

26:55.953 --> 26:58.938
- my career behind a desk?
- Well, that's a good question.

26:58.973 --> 27:01.496
Exactly.
I think Kiki and I ...

27:01.504 --> 27:06.545
You realize that you light up
every time you mention her name?

27:06.581 --> 27:08.914
Might be time to ask her out.

27:08.950 --> 27:12.218
I've had three failed marriages.
I just...

27:12.253 --> 27:13.953
Kiki deserves better.

27:13.988 --> 27:17.056
Oh, come on. Your three
ex-wives wouldn't recognize you.

27:17.091 --> 27:20.092
And Kiki would be a fool to let you go.

27:20.128 --> 27:22.094
I'm gonna grab you that burger.

27:27.635 --> 27:31.872
Hey. How was Connecticut?
Did you find a big pile

27:31.873 --> 27:34.807
of murder weapon shavings
next to a wood chipper?

27:34.842 --> 27:36.709
- No.
- Mnh.

27:36.744 --> 27:38.077
But we did find this

27:38.112 --> 27:40.579
under the carpeting in
the trunk of Cynthia's car.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.847
In the frenzy of planning the murder,

27:41.883 --> 27:44.683
- she must've forgotten it was there.
- A burner phone.

27:44.719 --> 27:46.852
- Yep.
- No fingerprints.

27:46.888 --> 27:48.120
But Nina confirmed that it was used

27:48.156 --> 27:50.373
to make three short calls
to Ron's house in the

27:50.374 --> 27:52.591
timeline the first wife
gave us for hang-ups.

27:52.627 --> 27:53.894
Hmm.

27:54.929 --> 27:56.796
Seems like a pretty big mistake

27:56.831 --> 27:58.597
in an otherwise buttoned-up crime.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.933
If criminals didn't make
mistakes, we'd never catch them.

28:00.968 --> 28:02.835
True.

28:04.806 --> 28:08.274
<i>How did she get in the room?</i>

28:08.309 --> 28:12.077
I mean, did our victim let her in?
And why would he do that?

28:12.113 --> 28:15.031
And if she was already hiding
there, then wouldn't they

28:15.032 --> 28:17.950
hear her crawling out with
her gigantic murder weapon?

28:17.985 --> 28:19.385
Where you going with this?

28:19.420 --> 28:24.757
Well, it's always the spouse.
Just in this case, we have two.

28:24.792 --> 28:28.360
- They did it together.
- It's the only thing that makes sense.

28:28.396 --> 28:31.096
- How do we prove it?
- I have no idea.

28:31.132 --> 28:34.033
So... what now?

28:34.068 --> 28:38.270
Well, now we do the only logical thing.

28:38.306 --> 28:39.905
We drink!

28:42.343 --> 28:44.143
<i>♪ The red parade ♪</i>

28:44.178 --> 28:49.114
How did a sweat lodge get you
to a laser-carved baseball bat?

28:49.150 --> 28:52.718
Just a whisper of insight.
As Sherlock Holmes said,

28:52.753 --> 28:54.720
"eliminate all of the
impossible solutions.

28:54.755 --> 28:58.190
Whatever's left, however
improbable, is the answer."

28:58.226 --> 29:01.193
Seems like he could've
said that in fewer words.

29:01.229 --> 29:04.147
But okay, so tell me
about some of the other

29:04.148 --> 29:07.066
- sweat lodge revelations.
- You mean about you?

29:07.101 --> 29:08.767
Sure.

29:08.803 --> 29:10.223
- You really wanna know?
- Mm-hmm.

29:10.258 --> 29:13.339
- No, you don't.
- I said "yes."

29:13.374 --> 29:16.208
No, the cop part of you that
wants answers said "yes."

29:16.244 --> 29:17.977
But you've convinced me
that the other part of you

29:18.012 --> 29:20.079
really wants to figure
it out on your own.

29:20.114 --> 29:23.449
I fear that the sweat
lodge was not beneficial

29:23.484 --> 29:25.684
to the clarity of our conversations.

29:27.421 --> 29:30.456
- You ready to go?
- No, I have to ask Korsak something.

29:30.491 --> 29:33.125
<i>♪ all my words are... ♪</i>

29:33.160 --> 29:36.428
- Are you okay?
- Hmm? Yes. I am.

29:36.464 --> 29:38.430
Sorry.
Just thinking about the case.

29:38.466 --> 29:40.333
Um, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

29:40.334 --> 29:41.267
- Yeah.
- All right.

29:41.302 --> 29:43.135
- Bye, guys.
- Good night.

29:43.170 --> 29:45.355
Hi.
So I wanna tell you

29:45.356 --> 29:47.773
about another idea I had
at the sweat lodge.

29:47.808 --> 29:50.075
Wow. All that discomfort
really worked for you.

29:50.111 --> 29:52.845
It did.
Anyway, this is about Tasha.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.447
You want me to go grab Jane
so you can tell us all at once?

29:55.483 --> 29:57.383
No, no. I wanna get all my ducks
in a row before I talk to her.

29:57.418 --> 29:59.151
- I'm all ears.
- Me, too.

29:59.186 --> 30:01.987
Well, I went to the
admissions office at B.C.U.

30:02.023 --> 30:04.823
I didn't help her because
Jane said that I couldn't.

30:04.859 --> 30:06.725
But it turns out she
didn't need my help.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.228
- She got in on her own.
- Oh, good for Tasha.

30:09.263 --> 30:12.264
Yeah. But we
have a different problem.

30:53.975 --> 30:56.141
<i>Wait!</i>

31:41.122 --> 31:42.955
<i>Wait!</i>

31:54.268 --> 31:57.903
<i>Wait!
No!</i>

32:28.002 --> 32:32.304
- Detective Jane?
- Hi, Judith.

32:36.010 --> 32:38.877
- Did you put this here?
- Yes. Sorry.

32:38.913 --> 32:41.246
I went to get a clean cloth.

32:41.282 --> 32:43.148
<i>Since Detective Barry died,</i>

32:43.184 --> 32:46.018
I try to clean his desk
when no one is here.

32:46.053 --> 32:49.188
That's very nice.
Thank you.

32:56.130 --> 32:59.565
- Detective Jane?
- Yeah.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.368
I don't know why, but I feel...

33:03.404 --> 33:08.359
I feel like I wanna tell you
that everything's gonna be okay.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.876
You want me to put the blue guy
back where he belongs?

33:14.911 --> 33:16.615
No.

33:18.586 --> 33:22.921
- No, he's fine right here.
- Okay. Okay.

33:22.957 --> 33:26.024
- Good night, Detective Jane.
- Good night.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.420
Um, I don't know what's
keeping her. I'm so sorry.

34:09.456 --> 34:11.723
I-I've already told
you everything I know.

34:11.759 --> 34:15.226
I-I don't know how Detective
Rizzoli thinks I can help.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.862
There's just a few little things.

34:17.898 --> 34:21.967
Uh, I know this must be hard.
How you doing?

34:22.002 --> 34:24.168
I'm...

34:24.204 --> 34:26.138
I'm still in shock, I guess,

34:26.172 --> 34:30.141
<i>As I'm sure you can imagine.</i>

34:30.177 --> 34:31.810
<i>You've obviously been around</i>

34:31.844 --> 34:33.311
<i>a lot of people who are
mourning over a loss ...</i>

34:33.347 --> 34:35.147
How long should we let her stew?

34:35.181 --> 34:38.083
At least until she gets
antsy. If she looks like she's

34:38.085 --> 34:40.985
gonna bolt, you can go in
there and use your charm.

34:41.021 --> 34:43.322
How'd you get this idea?

34:44.358 --> 34:46.692
Frost.

34:46.927 --> 34:49.161
I know. I know you don't
believe in that sort of thing.

34:49.196 --> 34:52.030
This happens many more
times, I'll have no choice.

35:04.812 --> 35:07.312
I know that's not the murder weapon.

35:07.347 --> 35:10.015
It's probably in some
wood chipper somewhere.

35:10.050 --> 35:13.418
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Mm-hmm.

35:13.454 --> 35:17.055
You and Linda probably
stood there together,

35:17.090 --> 35:19.458
made sure that it couldn't
be traced back to you,

35:19.493 --> 35:24.029
ordering it by mail to a P.O.Box,
using a money order.

35:24.064 --> 35:25.831
I think I'd like to go.

35:25.866 --> 35:28.467
This is a burner phone we
found in the trunk of your car.

35:28.502 --> 35:31.470
It made calls to Ronald's house.
Short ones.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.805
Hang-ups, we hear.

35:33.841 --> 35:36.575
Do you know how we know
that they were hang-ups?

35:36.610 --> 35:38.776
Linda told us.

35:40.247 --> 35:42.447
Did you meet Nina?

35:42.483 --> 35:46.284
She's in charge of
incriminating evidence.

35:48.121 --> 35:50.288
<i>There was a note.
What did it say?</i>

35:50.324 --> 35:53.258
<i>I don't know. It was slipped
under the door at our home.</i>

35:53.293 --> 35:55.427
<i>It was addressed to Ron.</i>

35:55.462 --> 35:58.530
<i>He read it, he ... he folded it up,
he put it back in his pocket.</i>

35:58.565 --> 36:01.032
<i>I could tell he was upset.
But he just said that</i>

36:01.068 --> 36:04.069
<i>the real estate deal had gone
South, not to worry about it.</i>

36:04.104 --> 36:06.104
<i>- When was this?
- It was a month ago.</i>

36:06.139 --> 36:07.906
<i>There were phone calls, too.</i>

36:07.941 --> 36:11.042
<i>A few of them. Hang-ups.
But then they stopped.</i>

36:11.078 --> 36:13.879
The moment we pegged this as
a murder, she turned on you.

36:13.914 --> 36:16.548
She even planted the phone just in case.

36:16.583 --> 36:21.286
So think back to all the
times that you were together,

36:21.321 --> 36:24.256
when she had a chance to
get in the trunk of your car,

36:24.291 --> 36:26.091
and then I'll need you
to answer my question.

36:26.126 --> 36:27.526
What question?

36:27.561 --> 36:31.530
Well, she wanted Ronald dead,
and in a perfect world,

36:31.565 --> 36:36.134
she wanted you to take the fall for it.
So my question is,

36:36.169 --> 36:39.437
were you smart enough to see
this coming and protect yourself?

36:45.045 --> 36:47.078
Detective Rizzoli, after
all I've been through,

36:47.114 --> 36:49.414
- to seems cruel to keep me ...
- Save it, Linda.

36:49.449 --> 36:51.883
Cynthia has a recording of
them planning the murder.

36:51.919 --> 36:55.420
- Helpful.
- Linda Wallace, you're under arrest

36:55.455 --> 36:57.556
for the murder of Ronald Wallace.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.492
- Come on.
- What did he see in her?!

37:00.527 --> 37:02.460
I'm sure she's asking the same thing.

37:02.496 --> 37:04.429
You have the right to remain silent.

37:04.464 --> 37:06.665
<i>Anything you say can and
will be used against you.</i>

37:10.437 --> 37:12.571
Moscow mule, table 10.

37:12.606 --> 37:16.308
When exactly did ginger
beer become indispensable?

37:19.346 --> 37:23.548
- Did you call Kiki yet?
- She's coming by later.

37:23.584 --> 37:25.584
<i>Coming by coming by?</i>

37:25.619 --> 37:28.420
Well, it's not a date.
We're gonna talk about

37:28.455 --> 37:29.921
winding down our
professional relationship

37:29.957 --> 37:32.057
and what might follow.

37:32.092 --> 37:35.560
- But coming by the bar...
- It's a good sign, huh?

37:35.596 --> 37:37.062
Ooh!

37:37.097 --> 37:39.297
- Thank you.
- For what?

37:39.333 --> 37:42.067
Encouragement.
I mean, who knows what happens,

37:42.102 --> 37:44.536
but I feel like a new man already.

37:44.571 --> 37:48.373
- Ooh, whee!
- You're welcome.

37:48.408 --> 37:50.575
<i>Then his 5-color pen</i>

37:50.611 --> 37:54.346
rolls into the flames on his desk
and totally melted.

37:54.381 --> 37:58.350
Okay, you realize that
only nerds think this is funny.

37:58.385 --> 38:00.552
Only a person without a sense of humor

38:00.587 --> 38:04.389
- would not think that this is funny.
- Agree to disagree.

38:04.424 --> 38:07.238
- Agree that you're a stick in the mud.
- Yo, ho!

38:07.273 --> 38:08.813
Nobody's ever said that
to me in my entire life!

38:08.848 --> 38:10.195
- Wow.
- Whoo!

38:13.066 --> 38:17.602
- So what's up?
- Ahem.

38:17.638 --> 38:20.372
Okay, you guys are creeping me out.

38:20.407 --> 38:23.508
- Maura, go ahead. Tell her.
- You tell her.

38:23.543 --> 38:25.243
No, no, no. It's a sweat
lodge thing. Go ahead.

38:25.278 --> 38:28.446
Well, we heard about
but did nothing to facilitate

38:28.482 --> 38:30.448
your acceptance into B.C.U.

38:30.484 --> 38:32.384
And we also heard that
the financial aid offer

38:32.419 --> 38:33.585
- was ... Yeah.
- Shitty.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.020
<i>- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!</i>

38:35.055 --> 38:36.755
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

38:36.790 --> 38:39.658
So our very own Vince
Korsak has organized

38:39.693 --> 38:42.627
a B.P.D. scholarship
for deserving students,

38:42.663 --> 38:47.265
- and you are this year's recipient.
- Oh!

38:47.300 --> 38:50.502
I-I am?
How?

38:50.537 --> 38:53.004
<i>Well, you met all the qualifications.</i>

38:53.040 --> 38:55.140
You're a great kid.
You're a great student.

38:55.175 --> 38:57.275
You were... trapped in an
elevator with a detective.

38:57.310 --> 39:02.480
- You were shot!
- The Barry Frost Memorial Scholarship.

39:05.452 --> 39:10.510
- This is amazing.
- Congratulations.

39:11.491 --> 39:13.358
- Ah!
- Congrats.

39:15.562 --> 39:19.164
So who was Barry Frost?

39:20.500 --> 39:23.535
Uh, he ... he was a friend.

39:23.570 --> 39:25.603
And ... And he's gonna watch over you.

39:27.474 --> 39:29.783
Come on, Tasha.
Let's mix you up some

39:29.818 --> 39:31.042
virgin something or other to celebrate.

39:31.078 --> 39:33.778
<i>Good job.</i>

39:39.219 --> 39:42.620
Obviously, Barry's scholarship

39:42.656 --> 39:45.623
was sweat lodge revelation number two.

39:45.659 --> 39:47.993
Well, I only had it
because you wouldn't let me

39:47.994 --> 39:50.328
call the admissions office and help her.

39:50.363 --> 39:54.733
Thank you.
What did we learn about Jack?

39:54.768 --> 39:57.836
- He's awesome.
- Well, we knew that.

39:57.871 --> 40:01.506
And if an awesome guy like that
found his way to me, then...

40:01.541 --> 40:04.242
Another awesome guy
will find his way to you.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.645
Exactly.
And the next awesome person

40:07.681 --> 40:11.349
- doesn't have to show up for a while.
- Okay.

40:11.384 --> 40:13.318
Do you wanna hear my
revelation about you?

40:13.353 --> 40:16.488
No, I-I got my own.

40:16.523 --> 40:18.785
- You did?
- Okay, you can wipe

40:18.820 --> 40:20.525
the surprised look off your face.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.297
Yeah, I did.

40:27.701 --> 40:32.537
I was so focused on
work and family and you,

40:32.572 --> 40:35.707
and ... and you were right.
I was afraid of what would happen

40:35.742 --> 40:40.345
if I couldn't keep my feelings
in ... in that little box.

40:42.149 --> 40:43.815
But I don't have to be afraid anymore.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.251
<i>I got a message.</i>

40:46.286 --> 40:48.419
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:50.357 --> 40:54.526
So I know, no matter what
happens, I can handle it.

40:54.561 --> 40:57.495
Jane Rizzoli's strong
enough to handle it.

40:58.531 --> 40:59.798
Yeah.

41:00.433 --> 41:03.368
Okay, what is happening
with your face now?

41:03.403 --> 41:05.804
That was my sweat lodge
revelation about you.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.572
- It was not.
- Yeah, it was.

41:07.607 --> 41:10.275
It was not! You're just saying
that because I'm saying it.

41:10.310 --> 41:13.611
- Well, why would I do that?
- Dramatic effect!

41:13.647 --> 41:15.280
- Positive reinforcement.
- Pfft.

41:15.315 --> 41:17.510
- No, I would never.
- You would!

41:17.802 --> 41:19.217
Like the time that I got
in a fight with that mime.

41:19.252 --> 41:20.919
- Remember? And you jumped in
<i>- # Sunrise #</i>

41:20.954 --> 41:22.487
- and you fake-punched him.
<i>- # there's a new sun arisin' #</i>

41:22.522 --> 41:24.255
- That was totally different.
<i>- # in your eyes #</i>

41:24.291 --> 41:27.280
- It's not. It's not. He fake-fell back, 
<i>- # I can see a new horizon #</i>

41:27.315 --> 41:28.693
- then he really fell in the pond.
<i>- # that will keep me realizin' #</i>

41:28.728 --> 41:31.563
- And all his makeup came off...
<i>- # you're the biggest part of me #</i>

41:31.598 --> 41:34.732
<i>♪ stay the night ♪
