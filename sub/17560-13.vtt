Oh, wait,

00:17.308 --> 00:18.977
that Ben doesn't have
to work this afternoon.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.770
It's been like a week since
we have been able to hang out.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.313
We are gonna go
see a movie.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.358
Yeah, so listen I found this
one called "Daus Crudle"

00:25.442 --> 00:26.985
it's about
this German peasant girl

00:38.371 --> 00:40.123
Yeah.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.125
Isn't his Visa up yet?

00:42.208 --> 00:44.043
No, he just renewed it.

I'm sorry,
they need a studio musician

00:51.634 --> 00:53.094

I know we were planning
on spending the day together

00:54.888 --> 00:56.681

I'll turn it down.

the scary movie.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.148

stop talking about

It never happened.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.609
Well, if you and Holly

03:12.692 --> 03:14.485
are just friends
then why do you care

if she finds out
that you slept with Tina?

Yeah, yeah, that's right,
I'm asking the hard questions.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.368
Because, Gary,
it's not cool.

Wouldn't it bother you
if I slept with that girl Brenda

broken up with her?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.749

sleep with Brenda?

to tell Val

- No, the other place.

on your party tonight.'

was really important to me.

like him to put me before work.

of my new independent thing.

about the project.

Um, okay, well

06:56.415 --> 06:58.417
our client is president
of this company.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.170
And he put his vice-president
in charge.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.005
And then everything
kind of went south.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.340
And they may
go out of business.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.842
So they need
some good PR to spin it.

Well, that's easy.

so busy planning the wedding

07:32.451 --> 07:34.328
and then you were so sad
breaking up with Rick

07:34.412 --> 07:35.705

the holidays and I had

so much shopping to do.

that last one?

this is happening.

to start over from scratch.

I'm gonna have to rebuild
my whole client list.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.566
I'm gonna have
to re-establish myself.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.569
Or you could look
at my incompetence as a gift

08:06.652 --> 08:09.405

you actually enjoy.

this job as much as I did.

what we did?

I didn't!

all I can say is

08:26.505 --> 08:29.592

give you that raise.

- Did I?
- Come on, Val.

take a risk, you know
