WEBVTT

00:08.908 --> 00:11.900
Turn 90 degrees
to the left, please.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.843
Turn 90 degrees
to the left, please.

00:14.914 --> 00:18.350
Turn 90 degrees to the right,
please.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.079
About face.

00:25.492 --> 00:26.925
Try to hold still, please.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.756
ls it going to hurt?

00:28.828 --> 00:29.954
Of course not.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.861
A few photons
never hurt anybody.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.400
We didn't do this last year.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.632
That's because last
year, l didn't realize

00:40.740 --> 00:43.538
what an exciting tool
my holo-imager could be

00:43.610 --> 00:45.544
in the pursuit
of medical knowledge.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.206
ls something wrong with me?

00:48.281 --> 00:49.771
Your health is excellent.

00:49.849 --> 00:50.975
This is just another way

00:51.051 --> 00:52.882
to make sure
that it stays excellent.

00:52.952 --> 00:54.943
Does my mother have to do this?

00:55.021 --> 00:57.012
Your mother and everybody else
on board.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.216
l've made it
part of the annual checkup.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.919
lt's quite handy, really.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.723
By attuning
the resonance spectrum

01:02.796 --> 01:03.888
along a subspace band,

01:04.030 --> 01:05.793
l can take an image
of my patients

01:05.865 --> 01:08.026
all the way down
to the subatomic level.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.362
Subatomic level?

01:09.469 --> 01:11.664
l thought you said
this wasn't going to hurt.

01:11.771 --> 01:12.863
l did...

01:12.972 --> 01:14.906
and it won't.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.900
There... see?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.842
Nothing to it.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.645
Try to hold still, please.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.480
Are you making fun of me?

01:26.553 --> 01:29.522
No.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.955
lt'll only take a second
to download your images

01:32.058 --> 01:33.389
into the medical database,

01:33.460 --> 01:35.121
if you'd like to stay
for a moment

01:35.195 --> 01:37.595
and see what you look like
from the inside out.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.154
Why not?

01:40.366 --> 01:42.357
Here we go.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:55.315 --> 01:57.283
Handsome fellow.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.519
Hmm.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.826
There's some scar tissue

02:07.894 --> 02:10.089
along the base
of your lower skull.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.324
Computer, isolate
the occipital plexus,

02:12.398 --> 02:13.456
magnification 500.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.169
There.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.795
Scarring along the dura mater.

02:19.906 --> 02:20.873
From what?

02:20.940 --> 02:22.498
An operation.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.669
Computer, isolate
the cranial meninges,

02:25.745 --> 02:27.610
magnification 100.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.374
More scarring.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.909
No doubt about it,
somebody performed neurosurgery.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.886
And that somebody...

02:38.958 --> 02:40.892
was me.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.259
These microlinear incisions
are a dead giveaway.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.730
l developed that procedure
myself.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.232
l don't understand.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.734
l don't remember
having an operation.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.771
l'm a little confused as well...

02:54.207 --> 02:56.232
because l don't remember
performing it.

04:53.860 --> 04:54.827
Who is it?

04:54.894 --> 04:56.327
The Doctor.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.261
Come in.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.663
l've finished giving the crew
their annual physicals.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.725
But as usual,
the Captain was a no-show.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.133
Let's get it over with.

05:05.204 --> 05:06.637
Specific complaints?

05:06.706 --> 05:08.401
None. How's the crew?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.442
ln good health,
for the most part.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.636
l found a nascent
alien retrovirus

05:12.712 --> 05:15.476
bouncing between personnel
on Decks 10 and 1 1,

05:15.548 --> 05:17.516
but managed
to nip it in the bud.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.107
And there's been a little
more wear and tear

05:19.185 --> 05:20.675
on Seven of Nine's
cranial infrastructure.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.051
l'm going to double
her maintenance routine.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.522
Cyto-metabolism is normal.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.491
Endocrine functions functioning.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.993
That's a relief.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.364
l'd like you to drop by Sick Bay
at your earliest convenience.

05:34.434 --> 05:36.766
l've adjusted my holo-imager
for deep body scans.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.393
You're the only member
of the crew

05:38.504 --> 05:39.869
who hasn't posed for me yet.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.304
Maybe next week.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.898
lt's a fine instrument, really.

05:43.042 --> 05:46.671
l've already discovered
something of a mystery with it.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.236
Apparently, l performed

05:48.314 --> 05:50.680
a complex neurosurgery
on Harry Kim.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.615
According to the isotope decay

05:52.685 --> 05:55.176
around the scars,
it was 18 months ago.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.380
l don't remember that.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.356
Neither do l, and...

05:58.424 --> 05:59.618
neither does the patient.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.091
l checked my medical entries
for that period.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.684
There's no mention of surgery.

06:02.729 --> 06:05.960
Could your holo-imager have
misinterpreted the scans?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.294
Possibly.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.200
The computer is double-checking
the data now.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.292
l'd also like to run

06:11.404 --> 06:13.395
a complete diagnostic
on my own program

06:13.506 --> 06:15.838
and have a look
at my memory files.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.307
B'Elanna and Harry
are both busy

06:17.377 --> 06:18.708
with the plasma relay repairs.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.746
Let's make sure you're
next up on the list.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.212
Thank you, Doctor.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.486
Hello, Seven.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.490
Doctor.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.890
l'm here to ask you a favor.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.451
Another time.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.689
l beg your pardon?

06:37.764 --> 06:39.698
l am recalibrating
the deflector dish.

06:39.766 --> 06:40.698
Come back tomorrow.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.064
l should be finished by then.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.228
Looks like l'm two for two.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.569
Oh, the Captain's acting
like she's allergic to me,

06:48.641 --> 06:49.938
and now my prized pupil

06:50.076 --> 06:52.306
won't even give me
the time of day.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.948
State your request.

06:57.016 --> 06:59.541
A little mystery
has cropped up--

06:59.619 --> 07:01.883
evidence that l performed
surgery on Ensign Kim

07:01.988 --> 07:05.355
a year and a half ago,
before you came aboard.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.825
The trouble is...

07:07.894 --> 07:09.691
l don't remember it.

07:10.963 --> 07:13.295
l wanted you to help me run
a self-diagnostic.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.261
l will assist you...

07:16.369 --> 07:17.836
in one hour.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.804
Fair enough.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.275
Computer, locate
the Emergency Medical Hologram.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.287
The EMH is inactive.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.617
Activate him.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.988
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.493
l'm here to assist you,
as l agreed.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.326
l've run a preliminary
diagnostic of your program.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.025
Your suspicions were correct.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.896
l never asked you
to run a diagnostic.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.899
Suspicions? What
are you talking about?

07:51.003 --> 07:52.800
You don't recall speaking to me

07:52.905 --> 07:55.066
in the Astrometrics Lab
one hour ago.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.732
No.

07:56.843 --> 07:57.810
The last l remember,

07:57.877 --> 07:59.811
l was completing
the yearly physicals.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.312
You mentioned a neurosurgery

08:01.414 --> 08:03.575
you performed on Ensign Kim
18 months ago.

08:03.616 --> 08:06.176
Computer, locate the holo-scans

08:06.252 --> 08:09.119
l took of Ensign Kim
this morning.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.722
Any operation would
show up on...

08:11.791 --> 08:13.759
Unavailable.
That file has been deleted.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.589
Let's have a look at my program.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.802
A deletion in your
short-term memory buffer.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.998
Our chat in Astrometrics
never got filed.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.097
That's why l can't remember it.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.470
Hmm...

08:30.543 --> 08:32.272
lf l were given to paranoia,

08:32.345 --> 08:35.143
l'd say someone is trying
to keep me from finding out

08:35.214 --> 08:37.375
what happened 18 months ago.

08:37.450 --> 08:40.111
Hmm...

08:40.186 --> 08:41.482
My photo album.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.714
Doctor...

08:42.788 --> 08:44.585
l was quite a shutterbug
back then.

08:44.657 --> 08:45.589
Not a day went by

08:45.658 --> 08:47.888
when l didn't record
an image for posterity.

08:47.994 --> 08:48.551
Let's have a walk
down memory lane.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.255
Let's have a walk
down memory lane.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.990
Meet me on Holodeck 2.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.572
Computer, display
all holo-images

09:02.642 --> 09:04.371
taken on Stardate 50979.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.502
Those holo-images
have been deleted.

09:06.579 --> 09:07.807
Deleted?

09:07.947 --> 09:09.414
By whom?

09:09.482 --> 09:11.450
Unknown.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.279
l'm detecting residual photons
in the holo-buffer.

09:16.355 --> 09:19.017
lt may be possible
to partially reconstruct

09:19.091 --> 09:20.353
the images.

09:20.426 --> 09:21.654
Try.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.095
l've restored five images.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.723
They are degraded but intact.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.791
Let's see them.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.705
The Mess Hall.

09:33.773 --> 09:34.762
Do you remember this?

09:34.874 --> 09:36.398
No.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.874
Who is that?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.739
The Ensign.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.279
lt seems to be her birthday.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.249
l've never seen her before.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.354
The Ensign again.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.220
l never went on
a shuttle mission with Harry Kim

09:52.291 --> 09:53.883
and certainly not with her.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.563
And again.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.483
l've isolated your memory files
from Stardate 50979.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.748
They weren't deleted?

10:22.822 --> 10:23.914
No.

10:23.990 --> 10:24.922
Then why can't l remember them?

10:24.991 --> 10:26.083
The program was rewritten

10:26.158 --> 10:27.921
to deny you access
to those memories.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.587
l'm trying to restore them.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.498
Here, here.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.499
Here, here.

10:35.601 --> 10:36.499
Say, ''Cheese.''

10:36.602 --> 10:38.399
Cheese. Cheese.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.635
What happened?

10:41.707 --> 10:43.265
l was in the Mess Hall.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.469
The files are difficult
to localize.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.671
The memories will be
out of sequence.

10:51.884 --> 10:52.816
What was that?

10:52.885 --> 10:54.216
Our sensors are dead.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.117
Make a wish.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.423
They've stopped.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.756
One moment.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.962
Make a wish.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.105
l'm going to kill you.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.180
Ensign, l haven't seen you
in months.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.549
The price l pay for staying
in good health, l guess.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.453
Acetylcholine--
25 microliters.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.153
lt's not helping.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.422
l'm reading
massive synaptic failure.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.293
That doesn't make any sense.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.263
This is the last one.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.305
Say, ''Cheese.''

11:48.374 --> 11:49.341
-Cheese.
-Cheese.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.649
Call the Captain.

12:05.758 --> 12:09.023
l don't recognize this species.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.528
Seven?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.393
They are unknown to the Borg.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.695
Perhaps these images
have been manipulated.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.029
No. They're real.

12:16.135 --> 12:19.104
The image buffer would've
shown signs of tampering.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.661
l have a different theory.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.207
l believe there was an attack
on Voyager by this species

12:23.275 --> 12:26.711
and all our memories
of the event were erased.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.874
This is the unknown crewman
l told you about--

12:30.950 --> 12:32.713
Ensign Jetal.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.913
The question is:
Who was she?

12:35.988 --> 12:39.253
An alien intruder posing
as a Starfleet Ensign?

12:39.325 --> 12:42.294
Of course, it's impossible
to tell from a photograph,

12:42.361 --> 12:45.455
but one thing is certain--
we are in immediate danger.

12:45.531 --> 12:46.657
How so?

12:48.367 --> 12:49.595
Only a few hours ago,

12:49.702 --> 12:51.761
as l was beginning
this investigation,

12:51.871 --> 12:53.839
someone shut down my program

12:53.906 --> 12:57.205
and eliminated all my memories
of the last 24 hours.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.005
An intruder may be on board.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.779
Run a deck-by-deck
security sweep.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.873
Understood.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.441
Report to the Astrometrics Lab
and recalibrate the sensors.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.115
See if you can detect
any cloaked vessels nearby.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.283
l'll review the medical records
of the rest of the crew.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.520
Ensign Kim may not
have been the only one

13:15.594 --> 13:17.425
who was injured
during the attack.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.987
No. l want you to deactivate
yourself for now.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.431
We'll erect a security field
around the main computer

13:22.535 --> 13:24.730
and encrypt all pathways
leading to your program.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.896
lf someone does try
to tamper with you again,

13:27.006 --> 13:27.938
l want to be ready.

13:28.007 --> 13:28.939
Captain...

13:29.008 --> 13:30.168
lt's for your own safety,
Doctor.

13:30.242 --> 13:31.869
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.571
You will keep me informed?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.578
Absolutely.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.080
Dismissed.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.494
Computer... transfer my program

13:56.602 --> 13:59.571
from the mobile emitter
to the Sick Bay systems.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.037
Transfer complete.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.877
Computer...

14:09.415 --> 14:11.883
Duplicate all of my memory files

14:11.951 --> 14:14.511
recorded within
the last 48 hours.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.350
Duplication complete.

14:16.422 --> 14:20.518
Now... l'm going off-line.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.892
lf my program is altered
without my authorization,

14:23.996 --> 14:27.625
reactivate me and restore
the duplicate memory files.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.533
lnterface with the holo-imaging
device.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.297
lf anybody enters this room,

14:32.404 --> 14:35.032
commence imaging
in five-second intervals.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.574
Acknowledged.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.782
Computer, deactivate EMH.

15:27.993 --> 15:33.693
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.200
Hello?

15:36.302 --> 15:38.236
Restoring memory files.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.307
Restoration complete.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.003
Believe me, l was there.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.044
So was l.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.873
Commander Chakotay is correct.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.572
Oh? And how would you know?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.445
ln my youth, l studied
many forms of martial art,

16:24.516 --> 16:25.278
ln my youth, l studied
many forms of martial art,

16:25.351 --> 16:27.114
including the sumo of Earth.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.211
l've followed the sport
ever since.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.051
lt was the 77th Emperor's Cup.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.387
Takashi forced Kar-pek
out of the circle

16:33.459 --> 16:35.120
in less than three seconds.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.718
l had a fifth row seat.

16:36.795 --> 16:39.355
Then you must have been
ordering sake,

16:39.431 --> 16:41.228
because Takashi's knee
broke the sand

16:41.300 --> 16:43.359
and the referee gave
the match to Kar-pek.

16:43.469 --> 16:44.902
Exactly.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.438
lf this is another house call,
it'll have to wait.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.837
As you can see,
l've got a mutiny on my hands.

16:49.908 --> 16:53.139
A mutiny? l suppose
that's better than a conspiracy.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.742
Doctor.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.374
Tell her, Captain.

16:59.451 --> 17:03.114
Describe how you tampered
with my program,

17:03.222 --> 17:05.213
how it was you all along.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.351
Perhaps you should accompany me
to Sick Bay, Doctor.

17:09.795 --> 17:12.127
Et tu, Tuvok?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.324
You're conspiring against me,
all of you.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.696
Why?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.602
ln my ready room.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.277
You've been manipulating
my program.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.315
Don't deny it.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.747
l don't intend to.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.342
But... the alien ship...
the intruder...

17:34.420 --> 17:36.411
Did that attack actually happen?

17:36.488 --> 17:38.854
Yes. You were damaged
during the incident.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.755
''Damaged''?

17:40.826 --> 17:42.885
lt caused a conflict
in your programming

17:42.961 --> 17:44.189
that couldn't be resolved.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.525
What kind of conflict?

17:45.597 --> 17:47.462
l had no choice
but to deny you access

17:47.533 --> 17:49.194
to your memories
of those events.

17:49.301 --> 17:51.394
What kind of conflict?!

17:51.503 --> 17:52.435
lf l told you that, l might

17:52.504 --> 17:53.835
set the whole thing
in motion again.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.669
This ''conflict''
in my programming...

17:55.741 --> 17:57.072
Yes?
that's not good enough.

17:57.142 --> 17:58.074
lt'll have to be.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.110
Captain!

17:59.211 --> 18:01.179
l've made a command decision
for your own benefit

18:01.280 --> 18:02.838
and the welfare
of this entire crew.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.041
l'm not willing to debate it.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.050
How would you like it
if l operated on you

18:06.118 --> 18:08.348
without your consent
or without your knowledge?

18:08.420 --> 18:09.910
lf the operation saved my life?

18:09.988 --> 18:10.977
l could live with it.

18:11.056 --> 18:11.954
l don't believe you.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.924
You'd feel as violated
as l do right now.

18:13.992 --> 18:16.426
Whether you believe me
or not is beside the point.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.723
A year and a half ago,

18:17.796 --> 18:20.424
the only solution was
to rewrite your program.

18:20.499 --> 18:23.229
l have to perform
that same procedure now.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.666
That isn't fair.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.704
You're malfunctioning

18:26.772 --> 18:28.831
and you need to be repaired.

18:28.974 --> 18:32.137
Return to Sick Bay
and wait for my orders.

18:57.436 --> 18:58.368
Doctor.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.064
What's happening?

19:00.172 --> 19:02.037
What are you doing?

19:02.107 --> 19:03.802
Lieutenant Torres
requires a copy

19:03.876 --> 19:05.503
of your most recent
memory files,

19:05.577 --> 19:06.737
including the backups.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.404
You're going
to rewrite my program.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.243
The Captain thinks
it's for the best.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.714
l'm sorry.

19:11.783 --> 19:12.715
B'Elanna and Seven

19:12.784 --> 19:14.445
are setting up the procedure
right now.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.420
ln the meantime, you're to brief

19:16.488 --> 19:19.787
Mr. Paris about any experiments
you're performing, any tests.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.655
l'll be filling in
while your program's off-line.

19:26.999 --> 19:31.436
Okay. So, you're running
some kind of cell analysis?

19:31.503 --> 19:32.970
Yes.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.369
Well, let's take a look.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.963
What happened 18 months ago?

19:36.074 --> 19:37.041
Doc...

19:37.109 --> 19:38.804
Why won't the Captain tell me?

19:39.878 --> 19:41.641
She has her reasons.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.476
And you agree with her?

19:45.117 --> 19:49.520
l was there... and, yes,
l agree with her.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.954
Come in.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.889
Are you having
a little trouble regenerating?

20:32.965 --> 20:36.332
My alcove is
functioning properly.

20:36.435 --> 20:39.563
l am having trouble with
the nature of individuality.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.107
There's a time and a place
for philosophical discussion.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.610
2:00 in the morning in my
quarters isn't one of them,

20:46.678 --> 20:48.111
but l'll tell you what.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.011
Meet me in the Mess Hall
tomorrow...

20:50.115 --> 20:51.605
Tomorrow will be too late.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.948
We'll have already rewritten
the Doctor's program by then.

20:58.323 --> 21:01.053
And violated his rights
as an individual.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.026
Precisely.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.655
lf you've come to act
as my conscience,

21:05.731 --> 21:07.198
you're a little late.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.894
l considered these issues
18 months ago,

21:10.035 --> 21:12.128
as l did again this morning.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.535
l came to the same conclusion.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.198
Your conclusion is wrong.

21:21.913 --> 21:24.279
Coffee, black.

21:32.758 --> 21:33.952
Lukewarm.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.358
Now l've told that replicator
a dozen times

21:36.428 --> 21:38.623
about the temperature
of my coffee.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.598
lt just doesn't seem
to want to listen...

21:41.667 --> 21:44.158
almost as if it's got
a mind of its own,

21:44.269 --> 21:46.203
but it doesn't.

21:46.271 --> 21:47.761
A replicator operates

21:47.873 --> 21:50.740
through a series
of electronic pathways

21:50.809 --> 21:52.242
that allow it

21:52.311 --> 21:55.405
to receive instructions
and take appropriate action,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.710
and there you go--
a cup of coffee,

21:57.783 --> 22:00.013
a bowl of soup,
a plasma conduit--

22:00.052 --> 22:02.020
whatever we tell it to do.

22:02.087 --> 22:06.217
As difficult as it is
to accept...

22:06.291 --> 22:08.782
the Doctor is
more like that replicator

22:08.860 --> 22:09.849
than he is like us.

22:09.928 --> 22:10.360
than he is like us.

22:10.429 --> 22:11.862
He would disagree.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.124
l'm sure he would,

22:13.198 --> 22:16.065
but l can't let that change
my decision.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.760
l learned that the hard way

22:17.869 --> 22:20.201
when his program
almost self-destructed.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.035
l won't take that risk again.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.075
The risk isn't yours to take.

22:24.142 --> 22:27.134
lf one of my crew
chose to put a phaser

22:27.212 --> 22:29.840
to his own head,
should l let him?

22:29.915 --> 22:32.406
lt would depend
on the situation.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.885
lt always depends
on the situation, Seven,

22:35.954 --> 22:39.412
but we can debate
philosophy another time.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.927
When you separated me
from the collective,

22:43.995 --> 22:45.257
l was an unknown risk

22:45.330 --> 22:48.857
to your crew,
yet you kept me on board,

22:48.934 --> 22:51.425
you allowed me to evolve
into an individual.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.334
You're a human being.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.134
He's a hologram.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.438
And you allowed that hologram
to evolve as well,

22:58.510 --> 23:00.705
to exceed
his original programming,

23:00.779 --> 23:02.872
and yet, now you choose
to abandon him.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.644
Objection noted.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.548
Good night.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.985
lt is unsettling.

23:16.461 --> 23:20.693
You say that l am a human being
and yet, l am also Borg...

23:20.766 --> 23:23.758
part of me not unlike
your replicator...

23:23.869 --> 23:27.532
not unlike the Doctor.

23:27.639 --> 23:31.405
Will you one day choose
to abandon me as well?

23:31.476 --> 23:33.603
l have always looked

23:33.678 --> 23:39.139
to you as my example--
my guide to humanity.

23:39.217 --> 23:42.516
Perhaps l've been mistaken.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.487
Good night.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.677
l'd like to think l made
my decision 18 months ago

24:14.753 --> 24:16.380
for all the right reasons.

24:16.455 --> 24:21.825
The truth is, my own biases
about what you are

24:21.893 --> 24:24.589
have just as much
to do with it.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.857
At the very least,

24:25.931 --> 24:28.900
you deserve to know
exactly what happened...

24:29.034 --> 24:31.161
if you're willing.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.250
l'm ready.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.536
You're standing on my foot.

25:05.604 --> 25:06.764
l am not.

25:06.872 --> 25:08.271
Shh...

25:09.908 --> 25:11.102
lf you ask me,
they should have

25:11.176 --> 25:12.268
just locked the turbolift...

25:12.344 --> 25:14.107
Neelix...
the power's down.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.545
Jetal to Torres.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.139
Uh, go ahead, Ensign.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.411
Or should l say...

25:20.485 --> 25:22.419
Surprise!

25:32.731 --> 25:34.460
l'm going to kill you.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.395
l want you to go along

25:37.502 --> 25:39.299
on a few
of the shuttle surveys...

25:39.404 --> 25:40.769
if l can talk you into it.

25:40.839 --> 25:41.897
Another away mission?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.234
Certainly.
l'm flattered.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.673
l guess
the birthday girl and l

25:44.743 --> 25:46.506
get the pleasure
of your company, Doc.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.409
You launch at 1900 hours,

25:48.480 --> 25:49.538
Shuttle Bay 1.

25:51.149 --> 25:52.446
Hello, Doctor.

25:52.517 --> 25:53.916
Ensign Jetal.

25:53.985 --> 25:56.078
l haven't seen you in months.

25:56.154 --> 25:58.486
The price l pay
for staying in good health.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.685
So, keeping busy
down on Deck 1 1?

26:01.793 --> 26:03.021
Too busy.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.291
We're modifying
one of the shuttles,

26:05.363 --> 26:08.025
making it more maneuverable
and more... cool.

26:08.099 --> 26:11.398
Hmm... l see you've been working
with Mr. Paris.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.095
My condolences.

26:13.204 --> 26:16.765
l thought l picked up
a slight distortion in subspace,

26:16.875 --> 26:18.843
but it's not there anymore.

26:18.944 --> 26:20.844
Nothing on
our long-range sensors,

26:20.912 --> 26:22.311
but a few hydrogen atoms.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.109
Candid shot?

26:26.184 --> 26:27.651
Try to look natural.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.516
At least it's my good side.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.388
Let's get one of the group.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.636
This is the last one.

26:45.704 --> 26:46.693
Say ''Cheese.''

26:46.805 --> 26:47.897
Cheese.

26:48.006 --> 26:49.997
Doctor, l have a shuttle to fly.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.370
Ah, yes.

26:54.045 --> 26:55.706
What was that?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.338
Our sensors are dead.

26:57.415 --> 26:58.347
Power's being drained.

26:58.416 --> 26:59.883
Shields and weapons
are off-line.

26:59.951 --> 27:00.747
How?!

27:34.152 --> 27:35.710
Doctor to Voyager.
Mayday.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.482
We're under attack!

27:37.555 --> 27:38.817
l've got wounded.
Mayday!

27:38.890 --> 27:40.380
Acknowledged, Doctor.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.551
Set navigational controls
to return to Voyager.

27:42.627 --> 27:43.787
Commander, can you hear me?

27:43.862 --> 27:44.886
Doctor, please respond.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.122
Hello?!

27:46.197 --> 27:47.892
Computer,
engage auto navigation.

27:48.033 --> 27:50.331
Lay in a course for Voyager,
full impulse.

27:50.435 --> 27:51.333
Doctor...

27:51.436 --> 27:52.368
Stay calm.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.905
That weapon carried
quite a punch.

27:55.073 --> 27:56.301
ls she okay?

27:56.374 --> 27:58.274
She's unconscious.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.742
Voyager...

27:59.811 --> 28:01.369
We've lost contact.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.007
l sent that alien
back to his ship.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.448
You think they'd be grateful.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.681
You should have beamed...
him... into space.

28:09.754 --> 28:12.848
l'm not in the business
of killing people, Ensign.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.620
Synaptic shock...?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.855
But there was no neural damage.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.797
Mr. Kim!

28:20.865 --> 28:22.389
l don't understand!

28:25.670 --> 28:27.297
Oh, no!

28:33.411 --> 28:36.505
Doctor, stand by for transport.

28:36.581 --> 28:38.845
Beam us directly to Sick Bay.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.056
Prepare these people
for surgery.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.629
Here, what happened?

28:52.697 --> 28:53.755
We were fired on.

28:53.832 --> 28:55.663
There's something wrong
with their nervous systems.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.395
We've got to stabilize
their synapses.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.094
Get me a choline compound.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.102
Which choline compound?

29:00.205 --> 29:01.229
lt doesn't matter.

29:01.339 --> 29:02.829
Just make sure it's a pure base.

29:08.346 --> 29:11.110
Her spinal cord's deteriorating.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.917
Same rate of collapse.

29:15.987 --> 29:19.514
Acetylcholine--
25 microliters.

29:22.660 --> 29:23.820
lt's not helping.

29:23.895 --> 29:25.624
l'm reading
massive synaptic failure.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.723
This doesn't make any sense.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.324
Paris to Engineering.

29:31.436 --> 29:33.836
Transfer all available power
to Sick Bay.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.202
Acknowledged.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.831
Some kind of plasmic energy

29:37.942 --> 29:40.342
is arcing between
their neural membranes.

29:40.411 --> 29:43.744
That weapon...
it was designed to do this.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.648
To leave a residual charge
in the victim's body?

29:46.718 --> 29:49.152
An energy pulse that remains
in the neural membranes,

29:49.220 --> 29:50.847
working its way
up the spinal cord

29:50.922 --> 29:52.389
and into the brain.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.754
They'll be dead in minutes

29:53.825 --> 29:55.520
if we don't find a way
to stop it.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.652
l've got to protect
their brain functions.

29:57.729 --> 29:59.162
His neocortex is failing.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.595
A spinal shunt.

30:00.665 --> 30:03.793
l'll isolate the spinal cord
from the brain stem...

30:03.902 --> 30:05.494
until l can repair
the cellular damage.

30:05.603 --> 30:08.265
But l don't have time to perform
the procedure on both of them.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.305
Then talk me through it.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.306
We'll do them together.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.307
lt's too complex.

30:11.376 --> 30:12.343
Then make a choice,

30:12.443 --> 30:13.671
before we lose them both!

30:20.018 --> 30:22.418
Subdermal scalpel.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.419
Bioelectric field generator.

30:40.104 --> 30:41.731
His vital signs
are stabilizing...

30:45.243 --> 30:46.608
lt's working.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.940
Cellular regenerator.

30:58.056 --> 31:01.048
His neural membranes
are reestablishing themselves.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.320
Good... good.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.884
The attack...

31:27.952 --> 31:30.580
how did it end?

31:30.655 --> 31:32.418
Were there more casualties?

31:34.025 --> 31:37.893
We exchanged fire
for another few minutes,

31:37.962 --> 31:40.362
then the aliens withdrew.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.662
There was only one casualty...

31:43.768 --> 31:45.258
Ensign Jetal.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.471
l don't mean to seem unfeeling,

31:50.541 --> 31:53.635
but l'm programmed to accept
the loss of a patient

31:53.711 --> 31:55.838
with professional detachment.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.321
We are assembled here today

32:10.395 --> 32:13.125
to pay final respects
to our honored dead...

32:13.197 --> 32:15.563
Ensign Ahni Jetal.

32:15.633 --> 32:20.434
Her intelligence and her charm
have made our long journey home

32:20.505 --> 32:22.132
seem not quite so long.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.505
As she continues
on a journey of her own,

32:25.576 --> 32:28.136
we will keep her
in our hearts...

32:28.212 --> 32:30.009
and in our memories.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.388
We're low
on synthetic antigens

32:41.459 --> 32:42.926
and l'm sorry to report,

32:42.994 --> 32:45.189
many of the medicinal plants
you've collected

32:45.263 --> 32:47.527
over the past several months
were destroyed as well.

32:47.598 --> 32:50.158
l have some herbs in storage
you might be able to use.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.826
Been holding out on me?

32:51.936 --> 32:52.960
No.

32:53.071 --> 32:54.971
l was keeping them
around just in case.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.370
Good planning.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.306
As for the antigens,
l'll have

32:58.376 --> 33:00.674
to start replicating
them in batches.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.871
Which do you want first?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.382
Decisions, decisions.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.648
How do you make
a decision, Mr. Neelix?

33:11.723 --> 33:13.850
ln general, l mean.

33:13.925 --> 33:17.884
l guess l weigh the alternatives
and try to decide which is best.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.795
Which is best?

33:21.866 --> 33:23.891
How do you determine that?

33:24.068 --> 33:26.161
l never thought about it,
really.

33:26.270 --> 33:27.862
Well, maybe you should--

33:27.972 --> 33:29.906
think about it, l mean.

33:29.974 --> 33:32.272
l guess every situation
is a little different.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.935
For me, it's rather simple.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.877
While l'm faced
with a decision,

33:35.947 --> 33:37.915
my program calculates
the variables

33:37.982 --> 33:39.074
and l take action.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.710
For example, what
could be simpler

33:41.786 --> 33:43.845
then a triage situation
in Sick Bay?

33:43.921 --> 33:48.119
Two patients, for example,
both injured, for example,

33:48.192 --> 33:51.423
both in imminent
danger of dying.

33:51.496 --> 33:53.464
Calculate the variables.

33:53.531 --> 33:57.092
My program needs to
ascertain which patient

33:57.201 --> 34:00.034
has the greater
chance of survival,

34:00.104 --> 34:01.765
and that's the one l treat.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.000
-Oh!
-Oh!

34:04.075 --> 34:05.872
Simple.

34:05.943 --> 34:12.007
But... what if they have
an equal chance of survival?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.483
What then?

34:14.552 --> 34:15.849
Hmm?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.319
Flip a coin?

34:17.388 --> 34:18.719
Pick a card?

34:18.790 --> 34:19.585
Doctor...

34:19.857 --> 34:20.846
Oh, l'm all right.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.415
l'm a hologram.
l don't get injured.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.723
l don't feel pain.
l don't die.

34:24.795 --> 34:27.856
Unlike some people
l could tell you about.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.628
For example, two patients,

34:30.735 --> 34:31.895
both injured,

34:32.003 --> 34:36.496
both in imminent danger of...

34:36.607 --> 34:38.335
Don't touch me.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.569
l'm a hologram.

34:39.643 --> 34:41.440
Photonic energy.
Don't waste your time.

34:41.512 --> 34:42.739
Neelix to Security.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.076
Send a team
to the Mess Hall, please.

34:44.148 --> 34:46.911
A whole team, Mr. Neelix?

34:46.984 --> 34:49.475
Throwing a little party,
are we?

34:49.554 --> 34:52.784
Why, l attended a party
just recently.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.882
A birthday party
for a very nice young woman.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.293
l made a decision there, too.

34:59.363 --> 35:00.762
Several of them, in fact.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.560
When l came through the door,

35:02.600 --> 35:03.692
do l turn right

35:03.801 --> 35:05.234
or do l turn left?

35:05.303 --> 35:08.739
As l recall, l decided on...
the latter.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.102
Then, what should
l see before me,

35:10.174 --> 35:11.198
but the hors d'oeuvre tray?

35:11.309 --> 35:12.571
And another decision--

35:12.643 --> 35:17.046
''Do l take a canapé...
or refuse?''

35:17.115 --> 35:19.083
Oh. That's an easy one.
l'm a hologram-- l don't eat.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.640
Something's wrong with him.

35:20.718 --> 35:21.650
Don't you know it's rude

35:21.719 --> 35:23.209
to refer to somebody
in the third person?

35:23.287 --> 35:25.118
You had a choice, Mr. Neelix--

35:25.189 --> 35:27.783
''Should l do something rude
or not do something rude?''

35:27.859 --> 35:30.760
Doctor, we must return
to Sick Bay.

35:30.828 --> 35:32.056
Why should l?

35:32.130 --> 35:34.257
What if l don't want
to return to Sick Bay?

35:34.332 --> 35:38.200
What if l decide
not to return to Sick Bay?

35:38.302 --> 35:40.497
No. l don't choose this.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.402
Leave me alone! Let me go!

35:42.473 --> 35:43.997
Why did she have to die?

35:44.108 --> 35:45.302
Why did l kill her?!

35:45.376 --> 35:47.241
Why did l decide to kill her?!
Why?!

35:47.311 --> 35:48.835
Somebody tell me why!

35:48.913 --> 35:51.575
lt was downhill from there.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.583
You developed a feedback loop

35:53.651 --> 35:56.176
between your ethical
and cognitive subroutines.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.051
You were having
the same thoughts

35:58.122 --> 35:59.214
over and over again.

35:59.290 --> 36:00.723
We couldn't stop it.

36:00.825 --> 36:04.226
Our only option was to erase
your memories of those events.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.196
You were right.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.960
l didn't deserve
to keep those memories...

36:09.033 --> 36:10.364
not after what l did.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.299
You were performing your duty.

36:12.403 --> 36:14.496
Two patients-- which do l kill?

36:14.605 --> 36:16.573
-Doctor...
-''Doctor''? Hardly.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.165
A doctor retains
his objectivity.

36:19.277 --> 36:20.869
l didn't do that, did l?

36:20.978 --> 36:23.606
Two patients,
equal chances of survival,

36:23.681 --> 36:25.876
and l chose the one
l was closer to?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.279
l chose my friend?

36:27.351 --> 36:28.818
That's not in my programming.

36:28.886 --> 36:30.854
That's not what l was designed
to do!

36:30.922 --> 36:32.014
Go ahead!

36:32.089 --> 36:33.716
Reprogram me!
l'll lend you a hand!

36:33.791 --> 36:35.224
Let's start with this very day,

36:35.293 --> 36:36.385
this hour, this second!

36:36.460 --> 36:39.088
Computer, deactivate the EMH.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.098
Here we go again.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.468
Captain?

36:49.540 --> 36:53.476
lt's as though there's a battle
being fought inside him...

36:53.544 --> 36:56.638
between his original programming

36:56.714 --> 36:59.740
and what he's become.

36:59.817 --> 37:04.311
Our solution was
to end that battle.

37:04.422 --> 37:06.549
What if we were wrong?

37:06.591 --> 37:08.525
We've seen what happens to him.

37:08.593 --> 37:10.424
ln fact, we've seen it twice.

37:10.494 --> 37:14.794
Still... we allowed him
to evolve,

37:14.865 --> 37:17.299
and at the first sign
of trouble...

37:22.306 --> 37:26.072
We gave him a soul, B'Elanna.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.873
Do we have the right
to take it away now?

37:29.013 --> 37:32.813
We gave him
personality subroutines.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.078
l'd hardly call that a soul.

38:14.725 --> 38:15.987
Captain.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.790
l'm having trouble...

38:18.863 --> 38:21.661
with the nature
of individuality.

38:21.732 --> 38:24.565
You require
a philosophical discussion.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.466
There's a time
and a place for it.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.162
This is one of them.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.143
After l freed you
from the collective...

38:35.846 --> 38:39.145
you were transformed.

38:39.216 --> 38:41.650
lt's been a difficult process.

38:43.187 --> 38:45.052
Was it worth it?

38:45.122 --> 38:47.022
l had no choice.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.786
That's not what l asked you.

38:52.196 --> 38:54.528
lf l could
change what happened...

38:54.598 --> 38:57.726
erase what you did to me...
would l?

39:02.106 --> 39:03.471
No.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.169
Captain's Log, supplemental.

39:09.246 --> 39:12.010
Our Doctor is now our patient.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.017
lt's been two weeks
since l've ordered

39:14.085 --> 39:15.814
a 'round-the-clock vigil.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.787
A crew member has stayed
with him at all times,

39:18.856 --> 39:22.314
offering a sounding board
and a familiar presence,

39:22.393 --> 39:24.054
while he struggles
to understand

39:24.128 --> 39:26.358
his memories and his thoughts.

39:26.430 --> 39:30.196
The chances of recovery--
uncertain.

39:40.978 --> 39:44.175
The more l think about it,
the more l realize

39:44.248 --> 39:47.411
there's nothing l could've
done differently.

39:49.987 --> 39:51.784
What do you mean?

39:51.856 --> 39:56.589
The primordial atom burst,
sending out its radiation,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.890
setting everything in motion.

39:58.996 --> 40:01.590
One particle
collides with another,

40:01.665 --> 40:04.463
gases expand, planets contract

40:04.568 --> 40:06.092
and before you know it,

40:06.203 --> 40:08.501
we've got starships
and holodecks

40:08.572 --> 40:10.665
and... chicken soup.

40:10.775 --> 40:14.643
ln fact, you can't help
but have starships

40:14.712 --> 40:16.475
and holodecks
and chicken soup,

40:16.547 --> 40:20.039
because it was all determined
20 billion years ago!

40:20.117 --> 40:23.143
There is a certain
logic to your logic.

40:25.523 --> 40:26.922
Progress?

40:26.991 --> 40:29.926
l'm not sure if he's making
any sense of this experience,

40:29.994 --> 40:32.792
or if his program's
just running in circles.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.854
You've been here for 16 hours.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.628
Let me continue while you rest.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.669
l'll be all right.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.705
Go back to the Bridge.

40:54.552 --> 40:57.020
How can you read
at a time like this?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.248
lt helps me think.

40:59.356 --> 41:02.291
Think? What do you need
to think about?

41:02.393 --> 41:07.023
You. This book is relevant
to your situation.

41:07.064 --> 41:10.033
Oh? What is it?

41:11.869 --> 41:14.599
Poetry... written on Earth

41:14.705 --> 41:19.404
a thousand years ago--
La Vita Nuova.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.878
La Vita Nuova--
''The New Life''? Ha!

41:22.947 --> 41:25.211
Tell that to Ensign Jetal.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.510
Actually...

41:28.586 --> 41:29.211
l killed her countless times.

41:29.286 --> 41:30.685
l killed her countless times.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.588
What do you mean?

41:34.658 --> 41:37.889
Causality, probability.

41:37.962 --> 41:42.058
For every action, there's
an infinite number of reactions,

41:42.132 --> 41:45.898
and in each one of them,
l killed her!

41:48.806 --> 41:50.774
Or did l?

41:55.279 --> 41:58.043
Too many possibilities...

41:59.450 --> 42:02.385
too many pathways
for my program to follow...

42:04.321 --> 42:06.482
impossible to choose...

42:10.027 --> 42:12.689
Still, l...

42:12.763 --> 42:16.199
l can't live with the knowledge
of what l've done.

42:16.267 --> 42:18.258
l can't.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.171
Captain?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.503
-Captain?
-Oh, sorry.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.774
How could you sleep
at a time like this?

42:30.848 --> 42:32.372
Well, it's been a long day.

42:32.449 --> 42:33.677
You were saying...?

42:33.751 --> 42:34.775
What's wrong?

42:34.852 --> 42:36.217
Nothing.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.379
You're ill.

42:37.454 --> 42:38.546
l have a headache.

42:38.622 --> 42:39.714
Fever. You have

42:39.790 --> 42:41.382
-a fever.
-l'll live.

42:41.458 --> 42:42.755
-Medical emergency!
-Doctor...

42:42.826 --> 42:44.657
Someone's got to treat you
immediately.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.390
Call Mr. Paris.
You've got to get to Sick Bay!

42:47.464 --> 42:48.431
Doctor...

42:49.733 --> 42:52.361
l'm a little busy right now...

42:52.469 --> 42:54.460
helping a friend.

42:59.543 --> 43:03.070
l... l'll be all right.

43:03.180 --> 43:07.446
Go. Sleep. Please.

43:07.484 --> 43:09.543
l'll still be here
in the morning.

43:09.620 --> 43:11.884
Sure?

43:12.022 --> 43:14.650
Yes. Please.

43:14.725 --> 43:18.661
l don't want to be responsible
for any more suffering.

43:35.846 --> 43:38.110
Good night.

43:38.182 --> 43:39.945
lf you need anything...

43:40.050 --> 43:41.517
l'll call.

43:41.585 --> 43:43.052
Thank you, Captain.

44:25.829 --> 44:32.098
''ln that book
which is my memory...

44:32.202 --> 44:34.762
''On the first page
of the chapter

44:34.872 --> 44:38.808
''that is the day

Appear the words,
'Here begins a new life.'''
