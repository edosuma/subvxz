00:01.085 --> 00:02.416
Previously on
Teen Wolf...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.456
The mark of
a family of hunters... The Calaveras.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.788
- What would they want with Derek?
- How do we find them?

00:07.008 --> 00:09.715
- Mexico.
- You don't know where he is either.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.635
You know who took him.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.475
Say the name, Scott.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.185
- Kate.
- Is that Derek?

00:18.394 --> 00:19.600
Sort of.

00:34.494 --> 00:36.906
Go. Hey, let's go.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.558
I thought I could control it.

01:04.774 --> 01:07.766
All this risk?
Just for a basketball game?

01:07.985 --> 01:08.974
It's the finals. They need me.

01:09.195 --> 01:11.652
To do what?
Rip someone's throat out on the court?

01:13.199 --> 01:15.906
Even born wolves have to
learn control on a full moon, Derek.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.619
Yeah, but it's supposed to be easier for us.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.284
Why does it hurt like this?

01:19.497 --> 01:20.657
Did you bring it?

01:20.873 --> 01:23.455
- It's not working...
- Did you bring it?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.049
Go ahead.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.805
I told you, it's not working.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.052
Do it!

01:43.938 --> 01:46.680
Alpha, Beta, Omega...

01:46.899 --> 01:48.981
Again.
- Alpha, Beta,

01:49.151 --> 01:50.687
- Omega...
- Again.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.568
- Alpha, Beta, Omega...
- Again!

01:53.781 --> 01:56.147
Alpha, Beta, Omega...

01:56.367 --> 01:58.232
Alpha, Beta, Omega...

02:29.191 --> 02:30.146
Hey!

02:32.903 --> 02:33.892
You okay in there?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.454
Hey, you all right?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.039
What's going on in there?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.907
Just a second.

02:50.713 --> 02:51.668
Hey!

02:51.881 --> 02:53.121
I'll be out in a minute!

03:00.056 --> 03:02.547
You need to open the door.
I don't know what the hell you're doing

03:02.725 --> 03:04.716
or whatever you're on,
but I got a key.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.096
You come out or I'm coming in.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.018
Hey!

03:16.739 --> 03:18.445
You want me to call the cops?

03:18.741 --> 03:20.072
You hear me?

03:20.826 --> 03:22.908
Lady, open the door!

03:24.288 --> 03:25.403
Open it!

03:32.630 --> 03:33.790
You okay?

04:40.156 --> 04:41.111
Wow.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.699
Wow? Wow as in,

04:42.908 --> 04:45.320
"I've seen this before and I know exactly
what to do," kind of wow?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.072
'Cause that's the kind of wow
we were hoping for.

04:47.246 --> 04:48.861
I think you might
be overestimating my abilities.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.622
He's cold.

04:52.835 --> 04:53.824
Really cold.

04:59.675 --> 05:00.881
Do you think this is permanent?

05:03.220 --> 05:06.053
I'm not sure a medical
diagnosis is even adequate.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.760
This is well beyond my experience.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.058
- So what do we do with him?
- Until he wakes up?

05:11.729 --> 05:12.764
Probably not much.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.472
It might be best to leave him with me.
He'll be safe here.

05:16.859 --> 05:18.224
You mean from Kate?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.904
If she's alive and
she is what you say she is,

05:21.071 --> 05:22.811
she won't be able to walk
past that gate.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.148
- Why would she want do this to him?
- Knowing Kate,

05:26.368 --> 05:28.620
it's probably for a reason that
won't be any good for anyone but her.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.535
And bad for everyone else.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.623
You guys
should probably go home.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.043
He doesn't look to be in any danger.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.746
So maybe the rest of you
should get some sleep?

05:41.467 --> 05:42.582
It is a school night.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.802
And you all need to
start taking care of your own lives again.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.220
Someone should stay with you.

05:51.811 --> 05:53.142
I'll stay.

05:53.687 --> 05:54.893
My grades are fine.

05:55.606 --> 05:58.018
Despite missing a few classes.

05:58.234 --> 05:59.599
I'm so not okay with this.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.359
Guys, go.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.606
No.

06:04.782 --> 06:05.897
Text us if anything happens.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.065
Nope, still not okay with it.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.617
Not going anywhere.
All right, just 'cause you're stronger...

06:42.027 --> 06:43.107
Scott?

06:44.446 --> 06:45.606
Hey, Dad.

06:45.823 --> 06:46.903
What's with the tools?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.650
Oh, I was just, uh,

06:50.870 --> 06:53.862
getting started
on a list of repairs you guys need done.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.950
- What time is it?
- It's, um,

06:57.877 --> 06:59.583
- midnight.
- We were supposed to have dinner.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.331
We had a deal.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.497
When your mom
has a night shift, we have dinner.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.173
Sorry, I totally forgot about it.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.420
When we got back from the camping trip,

07:07.636 --> 07:10.013
I had to go straight
to the animal clinic to finish up work.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.135
All right, well...

07:11.348 --> 07:12.724
Tomorrow night.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.264
- Dinner.
- Great.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.429
Did you get anything to eat?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.601
Yeah, Mexican.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.577
How's he doing?

07:36.999 --> 07:39.411
His heart rate is alarmingly high.

07:48.052 --> 07:49.462
He's a lot warmer now.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.385
Lydia, I'm going to try something.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.884
I want you to keep holding
his hand, if that's okay.

08:14.787 --> 08:15.742
That

08:16.622 --> 08:18.112
looks like it healed really fast.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.579
Unusually fast.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.745
What does it mean?

08:21.961 --> 08:22.996
I'm not sure.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.498
Let's try something else.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.579
Grab me a five-millimeter syringe.
Top drawer.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.605
- Derek.
- Derek?

08:52.825 --> 08:54.156
Derek, are you all right?

08:55.619 --> 08:56.734
Derek.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.027
- Derek... Derek?
- Are you all right, Derek?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.412
Wait.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.162
Derek? Derek?

09:04.378 --> 09:05.584
Derek?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.665
Can you hear me?
You're safe.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.836
Derek?

09:09.842 --> 09:10.797
Derek?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.693
So it's, like, 2:00 in the morning.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.029
I wake up and
she's just lying right next to me.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.729
She just sneaks in.
This was, like, five times a week.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.485
- And then what happens?
- This...

09:37.619 --> 09:39.450
- Holy...
- Yeah. Right on, right?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.288
After that, we spent
the rest of the night spooning.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.489
That sounds okay.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.410
Yeah, but I'm always
the little spoon. Always.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.415
This means you guys
are together, right? You're dating?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.167
I don't know,
sometimes the way she looks at me,

09:51.341 --> 09:52.877
I think she knows
I'm not telling her something.

09:54.178 --> 09:56.089
- You mean Peter?
- We got to tell her, Scott.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.754
Yeah, I know.
ljust... I don't know how.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.926
It might
surprise you to know

10:01.143 --> 10:02.679
that some of history's greatest leaders

10:02.895 --> 10:06.558
have had to endure
some pretty great failures.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.223
One you'll recognize
from last night's reading

10:09.443 --> 10:12.901
failed in business,
had a nervous breakdown,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.399
was defeated for both houses of Congress,

10:15.616 --> 10:17.823
and lost as Vice President,

10:18.035 --> 10:19.775
before he was finally elected

10:19.995 --> 10:22.828
as one of the greatest
presidents that this country has ever seen.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.575
Who was he?

10:30.464 --> 10:31.453
Malia.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.552
Scott, phones off.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.642
Malia? One of our greatest presidents.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.304
Gettysburg Address?

10:51.944 --> 10:54.606
Phones off. Everyone.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.482
Malia?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.200
Does anyone else know?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.790
I said, phones off!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.414
Dad, that was yours.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.712
Oh. Um...

11:18.971 --> 11:20.962
"Scott, call Lydia."

11:25.227 --> 11:27.764
I don't think he's
just younger in body.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.312
I think he's younger in his mind, too.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.689
He didn't recognize either of us.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.642
And he looked
like he was scared out of his mind.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.071
So if you're a teenage werewolf
and you're scared, where do you go?

11:39.283 --> 11:42.195
A wolf goes back to its den.
But Derek lives in a loft.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.491
Not when he was a teenager.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.369
The Hale House?

11:46.582 --> 11:47.537
He wouldn't
remember the fire.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.080
It wouldn't have happened yet.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.648
Hold on.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.535
Say you do manage to catch up to him,

12:26.747 --> 12:29.113
what are you going to say to him?
That his whole family is dead?

12:29.750 --> 12:31.206
- I guess I'm going to have to.
- Oh.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.874
Good luck with that.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.667
She's probably right.
Maybe you shouldn't.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.542
You know, at least until we figure out how
to get him back to normal.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.544
- I can't lie to him.
- Okay, I'll do it.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.842
I don't think any of us can.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.510
Remember,
he can hear a heartbeat rising.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.714
When we find him,
we tell him the truth.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.137
If he gets to the house first,

12:50.354 --> 12:51.594
you won't have to.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.327
Excuse me, young man?

13:09.873 --> 13:10.988
You're calling him young man?

13:11.208 --> 13:12.368
Shut up, Haige.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.708
Sorry, but you can't be here.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.374
Hey, dumbass.
You ever hear of "no trespassing"?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.459
This is my house.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.878
Nobody's been here for years, kid.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.964
- Now get the hell out of here.
- Haige,

13:25.180 --> 13:27.296
maybe a slightly gentler touch?

13:27.516 --> 13:28.722
Are you all right?

13:29.268 --> 13:30.724
We can help you if something's wrong.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.218
What happened to my house?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.106
Where's my family?
Where's my mother?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.270
All right, let's go. Now.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.279
Hold on, just take it easy.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.696
Haige, would you... Don't... Wait!

13:45.951 --> 13:46.940
Haige!

13:47.119 --> 13:48.450
Haige, stand down!

14:05.429 --> 14:08.546
The other deputy thinks
I'm an idiot for even asking,

14:08.765 --> 14:10.972
but I have a feeling
if I take these cuffs off,

14:11.184 --> 14:12.435
you're going to be okay?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.805
And I think you'll help us figure out
what happened to your family

14:15.022 --> 14:17.013
so we can get you out of here.
Am I right?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.279
The other deputy's the idiot.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.774
I can't argue with that.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.742
Parrish, get over here.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.288
I ran this kid's prints eight times.
This is all that comes up.

14:36.752 --> 14:37.707
Derek Hale?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.245
Did you say "Hale"?

15:11.286 --> 15:12.617
|'|| handle this.

15:14.623 --> 15:17.330
I want you
to be honest with me.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.919
Absolutely and completely honest.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.586
- Have you been time traveling?
- Hang on, what?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.546
Because if time traveling is real,

15:28.720 --> 15:30.301
you know what, I'm done, I'm out.

15:30.514 --> 15:31.924
You're going to
be driving me to Eichen House.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.471
We found him like that.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.594
Where? Swimming in
the Fountain of Youth?

15:35.769 --> 15:38.181
No. We found him buried
in a tomb of wolfsbane

15:38.397 --> 15:40.638
in an Aztec temple in
Mexico underneath a church

15:40.857 --> 15:43.018
in the middle of a town
that was destroyed by an earthquake.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.895
You told me you were camping!

15:48.115 --> 15:49.946
Yeah, we were.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.364
In Mexico.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.695
Derek's been aged backwards.
He can't remember anything.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.249
We just need to talk to him.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.578
Yeah, well, so far

16:00.752 --> 16:02.333
he's not talking to anybody.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.254
He'll talk to me.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.673
Why would I go anywhere with you?

16:08.844 --> 16:10.209
There was an accident.

16:10.429 --> 16:11.839
You lost some memory,
but we can help you get it back.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.339
How much memory?

16:16.143 --> 16:18.555
A lot. But you can trust us.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.770
You're an Alpha.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.566
Okay, who are you?

16:31.366 --> 16:32.731
And who is he? Who are you?

16:34.911 --> 16:36.287
Oh, we're the guys
keeping you out of jail.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.823
Let us help you.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.028
No.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.367
Okay, dude, you almost
tore apart two cops back there.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.534
You need to listen to us.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.335
And that starts with no fangs, no claws,

16:46.548 --> 16:47.663
no wolf man. You got that?

16:47.841 --> 16:49.752
I'm fine as long as it's not on a full moon.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.003
You still have trouble with the full moon?

16:51.219 --> 16:52.208
I said I'm fine.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.921
All right, you coming with us or not?

16:56.433 --> 16:57.764
You want me to trust you?

16:59.144 --> 17:00.634
Where's my family?

17:06.318 --> 17:07.524
There was a fire.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.691
And...

17:16.077 --> 17:18.329
They're not here anymore.
They're fine.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.698
Just had to move out of Beacon Hills.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.122
And we're going to take you to them

17:23.335 --> 17:25.747
as soon as we
figure out how to get your memories back.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.788
Okay.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.552
I shouldn't have done that.
I lied my ass off.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.379
Hey, your ass is fine.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.715
You saved him a ton
of unnecessary pain.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.178
We'll figure this out in a day or two,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.555
he goes back to being old Derek,
everyone's happy.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.603
Except for Derek, who's never happy.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.726
It's just another person
that we're lying to.

17:47.901 --> 17:51.143
Just that I always feel
like it's better when we tell the truth.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.733
With Lydia, my mom, your dad.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.319
But that is Derek Hale in there.

17:57.536 --> 18:00.278
He may be a kid right now,
but he's still Derek Hale.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.987
All right.
Take him to my house

18:02.207 --> 18:04.698
- and don't let him out of your sight.
- And where are you going?

18:05.335 --> 18:07.371
I'm going to go talk
to the guy we should have gone to before.

18:07.546 --> 18:08.331
Uh...

18:09.756 --> 18:11.041
Yeah, I hate that guy.

18:17.389 --> 18:18.469
Scott's going to find Peter.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.513
And we're supposed to meet
Stiles at Scott's house.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.094
That sounds like a horrible plan.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.559
But we've had worse.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.682
Like yesterday in Mexico?

18:26.898 --> 18:28.308
About that.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.436
Remember how we were in the club

18:30.652 --> 18:32.734
and you and Scott
were tied up to electrified cables?

18:32.904 --> 18:33.859
Vividly.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.486
I know.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.940
I guess what I'm trying to ask is,

18:38.159 --> 18:39.774
if my hand was on
the dial connected to you

18:39.953 --> 18:41.113
and I had to turn it up to 10...

18:41.329 --> 18:42.409
Would I be angry?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.070
Yeah.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.000
No.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.621
Because I knew you had no choice.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.869
Exactly like Scott knows.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.042
And if you're worried about him,

18:54.259 --> 18:55.465
just remember,

18:55.677 --> 18:57.713
you're a katana-wielding,
badass kitsune.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.973
And he couldn't be more into you.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.093
Grab a card from
the visor so we can fill up.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.429
Uh, Beacon Hills Credit Union.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.058
Does this many cards mean
you have good credit or bad?

19:15.614 --> 19:16.729
Hey, it looks like you have

19:19.659 --> 19:20.774
a full tank.

19:22.912 --> 19:23.992
Lydia?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.000
Lydia?

19:52.233 --> 19:54.189
Are you okay? Lydia?

19:55.904 --> 19:56.939
Don't look.

20:19.761 --> 20:20.921
What are you doing here?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.752
I heard you were coming to talk to Peter.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.384
And since Lydia
tells me he's basically Satan in a V-neck,

20:25.600 --> 20:27.761
- I figured you shouldn't be alone.
- I can handle Peter.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.722
You can handle him better with me.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.978
We're going to wait here for Scott.
We're going to sit quietly.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.185
And we're not going to
call or talk to anyone.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.736
- Do | talk to you?
- No.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.861
- Good.
- Fine.

20:41.032 --> 20:44.570
- Who's going to talk to him?
- Ah! Are you getting taller?

20:44.786 --> 20:47.072
- What are you guys doing here?
- Waiting for Scott.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.286
Yeah, so am |.
We're supposed to have dinner.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.076
I brought extra. You guys hungry?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.032
- Yeah.
- No. We're not hungry.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.709
- No, I'm starving.
- Neither of us are hungry.

20:54.921 --> 20:55.876
Thanks, though.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.959
Okay, well, if you're not hungry, Stiles,

20:59.175 --> 21:00.381
your friend can still eat with us.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.088
- What's your name?
- Miguel.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.594
My cousin Miguel.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.506
From Mexico. So...

21:11.521 --> 21:12.476
Oh, my God.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.442
Fantastic. Egg roll?

21:20.155 --> 21:21.440
Hell, yeah.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.317
Shrimp fried rice or pork fried rice?

21:23.533 --> 21:24.693
Shrimp fried rice.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.820
- Fantastic! Egg roll.
- Beef and broccoli.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.291
What's wrong with you?

21:35.503 --> 21:36.458
Nothing.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.291
Your heart is pounding like crazy.
Are you nervous?

21:40.008 --> 21:41.964
He's just bad at introductions.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.172
Peter.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.180
This is Malia.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.690
Beautiful eyes.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.025
Did you get them from your father?

22:04.532 --> 22:05.738
Mother.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.440
Interesting.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.871
Anyway, I'm sure
they've told you a lot about me.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.036
The homicidal killing spree came up.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.750
Well, we're all works in progress.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.623
Well, when you
progress to your next killing spree,

22:19.923 --> 22:21.663
why don't you
try and make sure they all stay dead?

22:21.883 --> 22:22.872
What is that supposed to mean?

22:23.051 --> 22:25.588
What do you know about people
being turned by a scratch?

22:27.931 --> 22:29.592
Did you scratch someone, Scott?

22:31.601 --> 22:33.967
Don't worry about it,
the claws have to go pretty deep.

22:35.146 --> 22:38.434
But it's possible.
Like if you clawed out someone's throat?

22:39.901 --> 22:42.688
Well, yeah, it's possible.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.862
It's also beyond rare.
I mean, we're talking one in a

22:49.911 --> 22:51.242
million.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.370
So, uh, Miguel,

22:54.582 --> 22:55.788
what did you
say your last name was again?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.331
Oh, it's Juarez

22:59.003 --> 23:01.039
Cinqua Tiago.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.755
That's a mouthful.

23:06.719 --> 23:07.754
How do you spell that?

23:10.598 --> 23:11.553
Phonetically.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.644
Mr. McCall, you're an FBI Agent?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.684
He's low level. Very low level.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.231
He doesn't even have a voice.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.354
So do you investigate murders?

23:24.571 --> 23:26.778
Sometimes.
When it's a federal crime.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.070
What about fires?

23:28.283 --> 23:30.319
Oh, my God.
I wonder where Scott is.

23:30.535 --> 23:31.650
Shouldn't Scott be here by now?

23:31.870 --> 23:33.235
We should call Scott.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.699
What kind of fires are you talking about?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.248
Do you know anything
about the Hale family?

23:41.838 --> 23:44.124
Can't someone in this town stay dead?

23:45.049 --> 23:46.459
I think they were hoping you would.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.882
Do you have any idea why Kate would turn
Derek into a teenager again?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.341
What color were his eyes?

23:57.020 --> 23:58.055
Blue.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.220
After Paige.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.518
Which could mean
around the time he first met Kate.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.350
Derek and Kate knew each other?

24:08.323 --> 24:09.358
Biblically.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.815
That's right, Scott.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.822
You weren't the first wolf
to climb into a hunter's bed.

24:17.707 --> 24:20.619
Okay, I didn't lie.
I omitted certain truths.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.208
Vital truths now that I think about it.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.714
I don't want to talk to you.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.588
I want to talk to the Alpha.
I'll talk to Scott.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.085
Okay. I'm going to go get him.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.964
My phone's downstairs.
Going to call him real quick.

24:32.180 --> 24:35.172
You stay here.
Just don't move, okay? Don't move.

24:36.726 --> 24:37.681
Don't...

24:38.478 --> 24:39.467
I thought you...

24:43.024 --> 24:46.767
Okay, Derek went to the site of the house
thinking that it was still there, right?

24:47.153 --> 24:49.360
Yeah. But he doesn't
remember the fire.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.610
But if he doesn't remember the fire,

24:50.782 --> 24:53.649
then he doesn't remember
that it was Kate that set it.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.078
So what does that mean?

24:56.913 --> 24:59.325
Kate didn'tjust take him
back to being a teenager.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.242
She took him back to the age

25:04.462 --> 25:05.827
where he still knew her.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.799
When he still trusted her.

25:23.940 --> 25:24.895
Kate?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.148
Hey, handsome.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.692
Been a long time.

25:35.576 --> 25:36.702
Longer than you think.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.327
No, he's in your bedroom,
he'll be totally fine.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.113
To be honest,
I'm starting to miss the old Derek.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.289
So, if you actually
think that Kate's coming to find him...

25:54.971 --> 25:56.006
You might be right.

26:00.852 --> 26:02.843
- Wait.
- For what?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.348
Kate's out there twisting her way
into Derek's head yet again.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.681
- We need to find her.
- All we need's a scent.

26:07.859 --> 26:10.566
That could take hours.
If we want to get ahead of her,

26:10.778 --> 26:12.063
we need to figure out where she's going.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.612
Not to underestimate
my own cognitive faculties,

26:14.824 --> 26:17.657
but we're not exactly
a brain trust of geniuses here.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.193
Then maybe we should call one.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.462
We called Stilinski.
They're on their way.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.669
What does it look like?
Can you send pictures?

26:41.309 --> 26:43.095
Uh, okay.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.684
But...

26:45.855 --> 26:47.971
To be honest,
I have a 4.0 in AP Biology,

26:48.191 --> 26:51.274
and there are parts
of the human anatomy

26:51.486 --> 26:53.442
I have never seen before
on these walls.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.661
Why would she want to kill
a gas station attendant?

27:11.881 --> 27:14.543
I don't think she could help it. This was
done in a frenzy. It's not a murder.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.090
- It's a symptom.
- Of what?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.382
She can't control the shift.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.428
Derek said he had the same issue on
the full moon. That he was still learning.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.595
Kate's still learning?

27:21.766 --> 27:23.973
- She wants to learn.
- So she wants Derek to teach her?

27:25.478 --> 27:26.433
No.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.142
She wants the Triskelion.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.286
What's wrong?

27:46.541 --> 27:47.701
I don't know about this.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.499
I'm not supposed to show
the vault to anyone outside my family.

27:50.711 --> 27:52.576
Come on, we talked about this.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.253
Yeah, but how do you even know?

27:54.423 --> 27:57.665
Because you told me.
Don't you remember?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.382
Tell me if you remember this.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.650
We get inside the vault.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.656
We get the Triskelion.

28:25.288 --> 28:26.869
And then everything goes back to normal.

28:28.499 --> 28:29.739
That's all you want?

28:31.252 --> 28:32.492
That's all we need.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.745
But right now, we have to
get inside that vault.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.803
Over here.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.471
Why would your
family build a vault under a high school?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.563
The vault was here first.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.082
- Did you catch a scent?
- It's the same one.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.127
- The same one as Mexico.
- What is she talking about?

30:06.347 --> 30:08.053
One of them came after
us in the Church ruins.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.296
And one on the road.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.890
They couldn't have followed us here.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.514
But they could've
been brought by Kate.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.650
Oh, I've heard that sound before.

30:23.281 --> 30:24.566
Did it have an animal skull?

30:24.740 --> 30:26.321
A human wearing a skull over its face?

30:26.534 --> 30:27.614
I think so.

30:27.827 --> 30:28.862
What are they?

30:40.131 --> 30:41.211
Berserkers.

31:00.109 --> 31:00.973
Are you crazy?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.321
There's just one of them.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.645
And that means we have a chance.

31:05.823 --> 31:06.778
To beat him?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.448
To survive.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.565
Not that.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.896
Scott. It's both of them.
They're both here.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.728
- Where the hell's Peter?
- I don't know. He just took off.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.749
This is it?

32:48.134 --> 32:49.169
You're sure?

32:49.510 --> 32:50.590
Yeah.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.680
It doesn't look like much.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.005
That's 'cause it isn't.

33:00.104 --> 33:02.516
Quite the elaborate scheme
you have here, Kate.

33:03.399 --> 33:07.187
Two countries, Aztec temples,
Derek returned to a teenager.

33:08.612 --> 33:09.818
One that trusted you.

33:10.823 --> 33:11.858
One that loved you.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.572
All this complication just
to gain access to our vault.

33:18.873 --> 33:21.159
Just to get your hands on
that little piece of junk.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.498
Turn it over. Go ahead.
There's a scrape on the back

33:26.714 --> 33:28.670
where it used to say "Made in China."

33:30.384 --> 33:31.339
You're lying.

33:31.594 --> 33:34.051
I admit I have
a tendency to exaggerate things.

33:34.263 --> 33:37.005
But in this case
the truth is so much more fun.

33:37.808 --> 33:39.389
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart,

33:40.436 --> 33:43.644
that little pendant
is just a physical object to focus on.

33:44.482 --> 33:45.767
It's training wheels.

33:46.484 --> 33:48.896
Talia used it to teach Laura.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.851
I tried to use it to teach Derek.

34:22.269 --> 34:24.430
Is this real? Tell me if this is real.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.641
Didn't you hear that?
That was Scott. | just heard Scott...

34:28.400 --> 34:29.651
I don't know, and I don't care!

34:37.326 --> 34:39.988
You seriously need to find something
better than a baseball bat.

35:22.538 --> 35:23.493
Kira!

35:48.564 --> 35:49.553
Derek gave up on it

35:49.773 --> 35:52.185
back when he learned another way
to control the shift.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.641
When I taught him.

35:55.154 --> 35:56.485
Concentrate.

35:56.697 --> 35:59.063
I taught him to use emotion,
to use anger,

35:59.283 --> 36:00.398
and to focus on it.

36:01.285 --> 36:05.278
To feel every ounce of rage
and hatred that he could summon,

36:05.497 --> 36:08.079
and it was the anger
that taught him control.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.706
So you want to learn to control it?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.171
You want to get angry, Kate?

36:18.636 --> 36:20.092
Let's get angry!

37:55.315 --> 37:56.475
Wait!

37:56.692 --> 37:57.727
Wait!

38:25.179 --> 38:26.168
Derek?

38:55.626 --> 38:59.665
It was never about the Triskelion.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.374
They took it while I was blinded.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.083
Took what?

39:14.186 --> 39:15.266
Bonds.

39:18.482 --> 39:20.347
Bearer bonds and they took them all.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.024
Bearer bonds? Hold on. Hold on.
Are you saying you got robbed?

39:23.195 --> 39:24.230
This was a heist.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.653
Somebody planned this.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.406
How much did they take?

39:30.744 --> 39:32.735
- Hundred-and-seventeen.
- Thousand?

39:36.208 --> 39:37.288
Million.
