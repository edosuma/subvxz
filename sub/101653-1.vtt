WEBVTT

00:19.458 --> 00:20.667
Many years ago my son...

00:20.917 --> 00:22.000
Our leader, Belo,

00:22.583 --> 00:24.917
battled against the destroyer...

00:25.208 --> 00:26.125
Cherno

00:26.708 --> 00:28.667
Victory was within our grasp,

00:28.833 --> 00:30.125
when the evil Cherno

00:30.250 --> 00:31.583
forged a terrifying weapon...

00:32.333 --> 00:33.750
the Wave Eater!

00:34.750 --> 00:35.792
The weapon so powerful,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.750
it destroyed everything
it came in contact with.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.917
Hope faded

00:44.250 --> 00:47.417
Until the Great Belo
gathered unique fighters

00:47.583 --> 00:51.167
with the ability to teleport

00:51.417 --> 00:53.417
and attacked Cherno!

00:54.042 --> 00:56.042
Boom! Boom!

00:56.917 --> 00:58.750
Cherno's ship crashed
into Earth's Moon

00:59.375 --> 01:01.125
splitting it into pieces.

01:01.208 --> 01:04.875
While Cherno escaped in a pod...
that pierced the Earth's core,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.708
and was trapped deep under the ground.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.333
Which is where we've chained him.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.875
The Earth suffered.

01:13.042 --> 01:15.375
The ice caps turned to deserts,
and the deserts froze over.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.792
New diseases and hardships emerged.

01:18.250 --> 01:22.542
So the Galactic Council
turned to the civilized universe

01:22.708 --> 01:24.667
asking them to help the humans.

01:25.542 --> 01:26.458
Imagine, my son,

01:26.792 --> 01:28.250
that just before the disaster,

01:28.458 --> 01:34.708
Earthlings had grown so close
to a new stage in their evolution...

01:35.042 --> 01:37.208
and three formidable Athletes

01:37.375 --> 01:40.292
born with the ability to teleport,

01:40.542 --> 01:43.042
emerged on the little blue planet.

01:43.542 --> 01:44.792
Remember this, my son,

01:45.750 --> 01:47.125
your father guards

01:47.250 --> 01:49.833
the most dangerous prisoner
in the universe!

01:50.083 --> 01:52.750
I know your mother is worried...

01:53.125 --> 01:56.042
...but Cherno's power weakens...

01:56.333 --> 01:58.833
and soon your father
will return home to you.

01:59.417 --> 02:01.125
This time for good...

02:01.292 --> 02:03.958
Message delivered to your son.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.792
Stop! Bucket filled. Next! Pump.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.208
Pump!

02:50.042 --> 02:50.708
Stop!

02:51.167 --> 02:52.042
Bucket filled!

02:53.583 --> 02:54.417
Next!

02:55.750 --> 02:56.500
Pump!

03:19.125 --> 03:19.750
One...

03:20.583 --> 03:21.458
Step forward

03:23.417 --> 03:24.417
Two...

03:27.625 --> 03:28.208
Three...

03:30.583 --> 03:31.708
Watch out!

03:36.750 --> 03:38.750
Why does this stuff always
happen to me?

03:39.792 --> 03:40.833
Ah!

03:42.333 --> 03:44.042
I told you not to stand next to him!

03:44.208 --> 03:46.333
Weird stuff always happens to him!

03:46.458 --> 03:49.375
No... it's just that lizard
over there...

03:50.708 --> 03:51.542
And I'm afraid of... lizards...

03:53.417 --> 03:54.667
Thank you...

03:57.542 --> 03:58.708
Want your water or not?

03:59.292 --> 04:02.583
He's bad luck. Just take it and go.
Get out of here.

04:05.708 --> 04:08.292
Thank you. Thank you...

04:08.750 --> 04:10.958
I'm just trying to find a job today...
thanks

05:01.750 --> 05:03.375
There are only two left...

05:04.708 --> 05:09.542
No more will be born
while I'm trapped in this pit.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.833
And when they take these from me

05:14.542 --> 05:17.667
this prison will turn into my grave.

05:18.708 --> 05:19.333
Father

05:20.583 --> 05:22.417
The protogene didn't activate.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.458
Every time he's nearly killed,

05:25.667 --> 05:28.375
his blood boils with adrenaline

05:29.292 --> 05:31.417
but...it's... not enough.

05:32.583 --> 05:35.833
I invented this protogene...

05:38.125 --> 05:44.042
A combination of unique cells
inside a microscopic particle.

05:44.667 --> 05:50.583
In my hands, it can bring
a new war to the entire Universe.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.250
And yet it remains trapped

05:54.375 --> 05:58.125
inside the body
of a pathetic Earthling!

05:59.250 --> 06:00.917
Stop scaring him!

06:02.542 --> 06:04.458
Go and kill him!

06:05.625 --> 06:07.458
Before his death

06:08.125 --> 06:10.042
the protogene will ignite.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.792
Get out.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.958
Don't fail me.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.500
My perfect creation.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.542
3:3!

07:05.417 --> 07:06.958
And as always we are outnumbered!

07:07.042 --> 07:10.792
But one day a 4th Athlete
will finally arise among us

07:11.250 --> 07:12.958
The rules as you all know are simple:

07:13.000 --> 07:15.750
each team must kick the ball
five times

07:15.917 --> 07:17.458
...in order to open
the opposing team's goal...

07:17.625 --> 07:19.708
and earn the chance to score.

07:19.958 --> 07:21.042
Salvo!

07:25.500 --> 07:28.583
Fan's kick knocks
the Sirusians in every direction

07:28.750 --> 07:31.708
as fast as the tickets sold
for this game!

07:32.000 --> 07:34.417
A terrific strike!
The Earthlings have the ball!

07:34.542 --> 07:38.500
Two more hits –
and the Sirusians' goal will come open!

07:39.042 --> 07:41.125
And all the way from cold,
snowed–caped Florida

07:41.250 --> 07:43.333
the Earthling's Pele is now
leading with the ball!

07:43.417 --> 07:45.958
Go on Pele! Give them your all!

07:48.750 --> 07:49.750
Salvo!

07:54.667 --> 07:56.625
Pele masterfully executes the 4th strike!

07:56.750 --> 07:59.833
One more and the Sirusians' goal
will be opened!

07:59.917 --> 08:00.833
Salvo!

08:00.958 --> 08:02.500
Pele intercepts the ball!

08:02.667 --> 08:04.167
And Fan moves in for the rebound,

08:04.292 --> 08:06.667
She spins like a tornado...
and strike!

08:12.583 --> 08:15.708
And give me a dog and call it Pluto!

08:15.917 --> 08:19.000
And the goal is open!

08:23.250 --> 08:25.708
The Sirusians' balls
will be ripped at the seams!

08:25.792 --> 08:27.958
While we cheer our awesome home team!

08:28.125 --> 08:32.792
Go little Fan! Pele is the one!
Natasha is our gun!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.875
I need a job,
any job – come on!

08:36.042 --> 08:36.792
Quiet!

08:37.125 --> 08:38.832
I've been coming here for months!

08:39.042 --> 08:40.917
I'm watching the game!

08:41.042 --> 08:42.832
You're not listening to me...
I need...

08:45.292 --> 08:46.958
Everybody's watching

08:47.417 --> 08:48.958
And you're distracting!

08:51.750 --> 08:52.792
I am not "everybody"!

09:01.167 --> 09:03.042
You should work,
and stop starring at the sky

09:06.375 --> 09:08.250
Hey! What are you doing?
Hey!

09:10.042 --> 09:11.875
It's twenty years
since the moon was hit.

09:12.167 --> 09:14.250
Electricity for only an hour a day,
barely any food

09:14.292 --> 09:15.750
and all you care about is Cosmoball.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.542
A strike from Siriusian Stan

09:20.125 --> 09:23.000
As Athletes fly like bowling pins!

09:23.250 --> 09:24.125
Big foot...

09:25.042 --> 09:28.333
It almost looks like Cosmoball
is turning into Cosmobowling!

09:28.458 --> 09:29.917
Wait! Here comes Natasha!

09:30.792 --> 09:31.958
Oh! What is he doing?

09:32.750 --> 09:35.167
It's a hit that sends
Natasha's Sputnik flying off her!

09:36.167 --> 09:38.167
She'll wanna reconnect to her Sputnik

09:38.458 --> 09:39.750
her bodyarmour,
her best pal as soon as possible

09:40.042 --> 09:42.125
if she's going to get back
into the game

09:42.333 --> 09:44.792
and help the humans play!

09:53.458 --> 09:54.375
Helmet.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.375
Pele, give me your hand!
Hand!

09:59.583 --> 10:02.542
And Pele launches her into the air!

10:03.333 --> 10:04.917
As Stan heads to the goal!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.167
Oh my, will nothing stop
him from hitting that ball!

10:11.417 --> 10:13.500
Goal!

10:14.250 --> 10:15.250
Holy zero gravity!

10:15.375 --> 10:17.000
I can barely keep my feet
on the ground!

10:17.167 --> 10:19.750
The Sirusians take the lead!

10:25.250 --> 10:29.292
- Goal!
- Yeah!

10:31.250 --> 10:33.625
What are you supporting?
They got the score!

10:33.792 --> 10:35.375
Stan is just amazing!

10:51.708 --> 10:52.500
Helmet!

10:53.292 --> 10:53.958
Helmet!

10:55.417 --> 10:57.167
You deaf?
Listen through your helmet.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.167
We're a team.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.625
What's your problem,huh?

11:00.125 --> 11:03.417
Power fluctuation is registered.
New Wave Eater incoming, sir.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.250
Very high strength reading.

11:09.750 --> 11:10.708
Prepare the arm!

11:15.667 --> 11:16.792
Then let's grab it while it's hot.

11:17.375 --> 11:18.208
Roger.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.917
Ahh, my creation!

12:04.042 --> 12:05.417
Switching to module 2.

12:06.042 --> 12:09.167
Steady now on the transfer.
You know it's always risky.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.167
Looks like Cherno
is giving us a fight today.

12:23.542 --> 12:24.375
Activate reserve.

12:24.708 --> 12:25.500
Initiate.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.958
Connect me to Belo!
Now!

12:59.542 --> 13:00.917
Belo on the playing field!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.458
And the game is stopped!

13:02.542 --> 13:05.667
And here comes the head
of the Galactic Cosmoball league

13:05.750 --> 13:08.083
Belo! Belo!

13:10.417 --> 13:12.167
Oh he's so dreamy!

13:12.667 --> 13:14.750
- But he's an alien!
- Exactly!

13:14.833 --> 13:16.667
Looks like something's wrong.

13:16.917 --> 13:20.458
Oh I wish I could just teleport over there
and listen to what they're saying.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.333
Well, if I could teleport then I guess
I'd be the 4th Athlete

13:23.458 --> 13:26.417
and standing there anyway!

13:26.542 --> 13:27.125
Stan.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.667
Arterial overheating. Nap time.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.167
No! It Looks like Stan is overheating.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.042
Sirusians are so big,
their mass makes playing on

13:40.125 --> 13:41.542
Earth's climate and magnetic field
twice as hard!

13:41.917 --> 13:42.917
I'm buying time.

13:44.417 --> 13:45.458
There's been a... technical difficulty.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Flight up high!

14:26.833 --> 14:30.750
Transportation sequence engaged!
Reserve energies activated!

14:38.042 --> 14:40.833
No! Noooo!

14:57.167 --> 14:58.625
It's in the tunnel.

15:00.792 --> 15:01.875
Back to position!

15:04.542 --> 15:05.833
Good job today!

15:11.292 --> 15:12.125
Combat mode

15:12.250 --> 15:13.125
Combat mode

15:14.292 --> 15:15.292
Combat mode

15:48.333 --> 15:51.125
HERE WE GOOOO!

15:56.083 --> 15:56.833
Salvo!

15:56.875 --> 15:57.458
One!

15:58.042 --> 15:58.625
Salvo!

15:59.625 --> 16:00.083
Two!

16:06.542 --> 16:07.583
Salvo!

16:09.750 --> 16:10.500
Three!

16:11.750 --> 16:12.458
Salvo!

16:12.917 --> 16:13.625
Four!

16:16.375 --> 16:19.750
And here comes the retaliation!

16:24.708 --> 16:25.375
It's hard to see what's going on

16:25.542 --> 16:26.792
Stan moves in for the block...

16:27.292 --> 16:28.375
but seems to be unsuccessful...

16:28.625 --> 16:31.458
– and lets Natasha make a free hit!
– Salvo!

16:31.625 --> 16:33.417
Team Earth has just made
five kicks in a row!

16:33.583 --> 16:35.125
The goal is open!

16:35.250 --> 16:36.875
Hit it, come on!

16:37.000 --> 16:37.750
Goal!

16:43.167 --> 16:44.792
Victory!

16:45.000 --> 16:45.917
For the first time in history,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.917
Earth is going to the finals!

16:58.708 --> 16:59.542
No!

16:59.750 --> 17:02.125
Noooo!

17:03.333 --> 17:04.958
Yes! Yes!

17:05.040 --> 17:06.458
I can't believe it!

17:07.790 --> 17:09.083
Outnumbered!

17:10.750 --> 17:11.833
With just three athletes!

17:12.708 --> 17:14.250
They still did it!

17:15.083 --> 17:16.083
Little Fan!

17:17.500 --> 17:18.333
Our Pele!

17:18.500 --> 17:22.040
And the captain of Team Earth – Natasha!

17:24.165 --> 17:25.500
Natasha!

17:29.583 --> 17:32.375
Yeah! We did it!

17:35.625 --> 17:36.292
Stan!

17:43.833 --> 17:48.250
What an incredible game, my friends!

17:49.333 --> 17:51.292
And as the public leaves the stadium...

17:52.042 --> 17:56.167
to back again tomorrow.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.792
I've been watching the games
for twenty years

17:59.917 --> 18:03.625
and every time my mouth
still hangs open like a child!

18:04.500 --> 18:06.583
Even though we played to a draw

18:06.708 --> 18:09.083
that draw ensures our team
reaches the finals,

18:09.250 --> 18:13.375
where we'll play against
the powerful Amazonians!

18:17.292 --> 18:20.208
So listen well my fellow Earthling...

18:20.833 --> 18:22.292
Because perhaps one of you out there...

18:22.583 --> 18:24.375
who will become the fourth Athlete...

18:24.625 --> 18:26.083
our team so desperately needs.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.292
As always, believe in yourself!

18:29.083 --> 18:30.583
Goodnight, until next time.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.667
Oh man! I was sitting this close!

18:54.750 --> 18:55.792
You should have seen that face!

18:55.875 --> 18:57.917
Next time, you go!

19:24.542 --> 19:27.667
Even if there were a planet
filled with losers

19:28.167 --> 19:30.458
I'd still be the biggest loser there...

19:43.875 --> 19:44.542
Mom!

19:57.333 --> 19:58.125
Mom!

20:01.583 --> 20:02.750
Get up, I'll help you

20:03.000 --> 20:03.875
Did we win?

20:06.500 --> 20:11.000
Am I the only person who isn't
brainwashed by that stupid game?

20:11.292 --> 20:12.292
Sit

20:13.167 --> 20:14.042
Thank you.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.750
Where's your medicine?

20:19.542 --> 20:21.917
Mom! You told me
you still had some left!

20:23.083 --> 20:24.750
I'm feeling much better.

20:27.833 --> 20:28.708
Where are you–

20:53.250 --> 20:54.542
Out of the way!

21:45.375 --> 21:47.375
This is the Police!

21:47.625 --> 21:51.250
In the name of the Moon Restoration
Nobody move!

22:08.458 --> 22:11.375
Captain! You'll have to go around!

22:12.625 --> 22:14.833
It's too high!
You'll never make it!

22:18.333 --> 22:19.208
Idiot!

22:37.167 --> 22:38.042
Go!

22:48.292 --> 22:48.958
He's down there.

22:49.292 --> 22:50.125
Yes, sir!

22:50.750 --> 22:52.125
I said...

22:56.958 --> 22:59.375
It's tweedle dee and tweedle dum

22:59.917 --> 23:02.000
Ugh! Very clumsy!

23:03.000 --> 23:03.708
Vince!

23:03.792 --> 23:05.125
Wait for a run!

23:08.125 --> 23:08.833
Get him!

23:08.917 --> 23:10.750
I got him!

23:12.875 --> 23:15.000
But ended up... getting hard knocks!

23:17.125 --> 23:18.125
Ahhh!

23:18.333 --> 23:20.750
I'll show you tweeddle...

23:28.125 --> 23:29.000
Lower!

23:30.875 --> 23:31.750
Jump!

23:42.208 --> 23:43.042
Come on!

23:43.250 --> 23:44.917
Stop gawking and follow me!

23:57.292 --> 23:58.000
Quiet!

24:06.917 --> 24:08.000
What is it?

24:11.750 --> 24:13.000
I think we lost them.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.792
What's next to my ear?

24:16.458 --> 24:17.167
A lizard.

24:17.292 --> 24:17.917
AHHHH!

24:18.167 --> 24:19.083
Quiet!

24:24.417 --> 24:25.375
Alright! Game's over.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.500
Come out and keep your pretty
little hands in the air!

24:27.750 --> 24:29.042
This is your fault!

24:31.750 --> 24:32.833
Out! Now!

24:38.250 --> 24:39.958
I'm coming out. Don't shoot.

24:46.042 --> 24:50.083
Now who's tweedle dee
and tweedle dum, hmm?

24:53.083 --> 24:53.958
Where's the girl?

24:54.417 --> 24:55.875
There! She's right behind you!

24:55.958 --> 24:58.333
What? Captain!
There's no one there...

24:58.625 --> 24:59.500
Where's the girl?

24:59.625 --> 25:00.292
She went that way.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.708
Hey girl! Run!

25:03.833 --> 25:04.875
Drop the pills!

25:05.750 --> 25:07.750
And put your hands down!

25:09.208 --> 25:10.750
Okay! Since you asked...

25:11.583 --> 25:14.042
Too slow! Tweedle dums! Haha!

25:14.917 --> 25:16.208
I'm too old for this...

25:17.125 --> 25:17.958
Ahhhh!

25:55.917 --> 25:57.958
I need a cocktail...

26:13.000 --> 26:16.042
Moon restoration attempt number 6329.

26:27.750 --> 26:31.958
Attention! Unregistered teleportation!

26:32.333 --> 26:35.458
Unregistered teleportation!

26:37.750 --> 26:38.958
Ahhhh!

26:40.000 --> 26:41.667
Ah.. What...

26:43.333 --> 26:44.833
Come with me. We gotta go

26:45.750 --> 26:46.583
Wait! Wait!

26:47.542 --> 26:48.625
I just died...

26:50.708 --> 26:51.625
Get in!

26:53.125 --> 26:55.042
Down there! Go! Go!

27:10.667 --> 27:11.542
Wrong way!

27:17.333 --> 27:18.167
Take a seat.

27:26.625 --> 27:29.125
Woo–Hoo! Haha!

27:34.042 --> 27:36.292
Back there...
why did you help me?

27:37.833 --> 27:39.958
Bad stuff always happens to me...

27:40.375 --> 27:42.125
Don't need to drag
anyone else down too...

27:44.583 --> 27:45.625
Is that right?

27:46.667 --> 27:48.667
You could've killed me
with that window stunt.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.667
So are you going to answer me?

27:54.792 --> 27:55.542
Why?

27:56.167 --> 27:56.833
Get off.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.333
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of bed.

28:04.042 --> 28:06.375
You know, at least I get out of bed,

28:06.500 --> 28:08.167
and don't just watch Cosmoball
like a zombie.

28:08.417 --> 28:09.917
Yeah? Who won today?

28:10.208 --> 28:11.000
It was a draw.

28:11.083 --> 28:11.792
You're wrong.

28:11.917 --> 28:13.417
I saw it myself.

28:14.458 --> 28:15.917
You're wrong if you think
you're not a zombie.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.167
I know you watch it too!

28:29.042 --> 28:31.417
I need to help my dad
not stare at the sky.

28:41.083 --> 28:42.583
Why are you staring at me?

28:43.250 --> 28:46.042
I've never met anyone else
who doesn't like Cosmoball...

28:47.750 --> 28:48.458
Anya!

28:48.875 --> 28:50.167
Is your dad sick or something?

28:50.875 --> 28:52.042
Been helping as long as I can

28:52.625 --> 28:53.458
We have a lot in common.

28:53.833 --> 28:54.917
One thing ain't much.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.375
No, I mean my mother is sick too.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.042
I'm going to ask you a question...

28:59.917 --> 29:01.458
And don't tell me to get lost

29:02.958 --> 29:04.250
What is your name?

29:07.042 --> 29:08.375
I'd like to see you again

29:08.583 --> 29:09.167
You going somewhere?

29:09.292 --> 29:11.333
I need to go back
to check on my mom.

29:12.958 --> 29:14.542
You're squishing my hand.

29:14.708 --> 29:15.667
Oh, sorry!

29:19.542 --> 29:20.583
Not gonna get lost, right?

29:21.542 --> 29:22.083
No!

29:24.625 --> 29:25.417
Anton

29:30.500 --> 29:32.292
Hmm... His flask.

29:43.792 --> 29:44.583
Speak.

29:46.917 --> 29:47.833
Father...

29:48.708 --> 29:50.292
Finally I did it!

29:51.083 --> 29:54.167
He teleported!
The protogene has activated!

29:55.042 --> 29:56.583
This... is a clump of his hair.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.542
It's perfect!

30:43.833 --> 30:47.750
Hahaha!

30:49.708 --> 30:50.958
What?

30:52.625 --> 30:54.500
It's not enough.

30:55.542 --> 30:57.333
But that's everything
I was able to get.

31:03.958 --> 31:07.042
And you didn't kill him?

31:08.000 --> 31:11.333
I did what I could.
The protogene is activated now!

31:18.792 --> 31:21.167
What's the matter, my daughter?

31:21.833 --> 31:23.125
Have you grown weak?

31:23.292 --> 31:24.583
No, never!

31:28.917 --> 31:31.500
If Belo gets his hands on him,

31:32.208 --> 31:34.833
then my days are numbered.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.042
Yes, I remember...

31:38.917 --> 31:41.333
Our days are numbered!

32:15.292 --> 32:16.708
So grown–up...

32:19.000 --> 32:19.917
Nice to meet you.

32:22.917 --> 32:25.417
Relax. Relax.
We don't mean any harm.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.125
Teleported!

32:30.875 --> 32:32.083
Congratulations.

32:32.375 --> 32:34.292
Twenty minutes ago
you teleported.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.708
You can now play Cosmoball!

32:35.958 --> 32:38.750
No. No. I don't even like Cosmoball.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.333
I have to take care of my mom.
She's sick.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.458
Calm...

32:41.542 --> 32:42.667
I am sorry to hear that.

32:42.875 --> 32:44.417
On my planet
we have eradicated disease...

32:44.500 --> 32:46.333
and I wish the Galactic Council
allowed passing

32:46.375 --> 32:48.292
of this ability
to the less developed civilizations.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.542
Well, she was healthy
until your ships showed up.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.708
I hate Cosmoball.

32:54.042 --> 32:54.917
What am I missing?

32:55.625 --> 32:57.083
If that is all, you can go.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.833
No! Go! Leave!
Is that your life philosophy?

33:04.542 --> 33:05.292
Yeah

33:06.167 --> 33:07.292
No, thank you.

33:09.292 --> 33:10.833
What do you want from me, anyway?

33:12.250 --> 33:13.083
Honestly?

33:13.667 --> 33:14.708
I like you

33:19.542 --> 33:20.750
Teleported!

33:21.500 --> 33:24.167
All we have is now.
Might as well be honest.

33:26.417 --> 33:27.417
You know...

33:27.833 --> 33:29.167
Girls like you...

33:31.417 --> 33:32.667
...you're every guy's dream.

33:32.917 --> 33:33.708
I'd have never thought–

33:33.792 --> 33:35.625
Hands up! We've got you now!

33:35.750 --> 33:37.792
You're under arrested for the robbery...

33:38.042 --> 33:43.542
of... a...

33:55.208 --> 33:57.750
Well, you're not gonna help anyone
if you're locked up behind bars.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.042
Better start liking Cosmoball.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.625
What? He doesn't like Cosmoball?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.375
We'll find a cure for your mom.

34:06.292 --> 34:07.208
Natasha.

34:08.125 --> 34:09.042
We have to.

34:18.833 --> 34:19.667
Deal!

34:23.042 --> 34:23.958
Deal!

34:36.333 --> 34:38.833
The stadium–ship is actually
a living organism,

34:38.917 --> 34:39.833
like a flower.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.750
I designed and engineered it

34:41.875 --> 34:44.542
to look like your Earth's dandelion
which is actually what we call it.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.667
Isn't she beautiful?

34:51.875 --> 34:53.167
Get in!

35:14.250 --> 35:15.958
The dandelion will scan
for anything dangerous

35:16.042 --> 35:18.208
and eliminate it
before it enters its core.

35:22.125 --> 35:24.583
Foreign contaminant detected.

35:28.625 --> 35:31.000
Foreign containment destroyed.

35:31.958 --> 35:34.917
But... It was just a candy bar...

35:35.500 --> 35:38.833
I was actually...
looking forward to eating that later...

35:39.042 --> 35:41.917
It must have detected
some dangerous ingredients

35:42.042 --> 35:43.042
Better you didn't eat it.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.042
We are now going to be taking
a sample of your genetic material

36:24.125 --> 36:26.125
to fuse it with our microchips

36:26.667 --> 36:30.000
and create a bio mechanical equivalent
of your neural connections.

36:30.083 --> 36:33.625
The result would be a droid
that we call Sputniks.

36:33.708 --> 36:36.083
Don't worry, we all have one.

36:41.542 --> 36:43.875
Look. He's waking up.

36:55.958 --> 36:56.958
Lizard...

37:02.333 --> 37:04.083
Say something
so he can identify you

37:04.167 --> 37:05.875
and know that you are
one and the same.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.000
Seriously?

37:10.167 --> 37:11.625
Tell him peek–a–boo.

37:13.542 --> 37:14.417
Peek–a–boo...

37:18.875 --> 37:19.667
Nice.

37:22.167 --> 37:23.417
What should I say?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.042
Something like peek–a–coo–coo

37:25.417 --> 37:26.542
I don't know what...

37:26.625 --> 37:27.625
There he goes!

37:29.875 --> 37:31.958
Careful, he's a newborn.
Be gentle with him.

37:32.125 --> 37:32.917
Be quiet!

37:33.083 --> 37:35.167
Let him concentrate
or we won't hear his name.

37:41.917 --> 37:45.167
When he senses your connection,
he'll tell you his name is.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.208
This is so weird.

38:00.167 --> 38:01.750
The same blood
that flows through you...

38:01.875 --> 38:03.167
flows through him.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.792
Tell him you're one.

38:04.875 --> 38:06.042
What do you mean?

38:06.167 --> 38:08.250
Say 'We be of one blood, ye and I.'

38:08.375 --> 38:09.167
Huh?

38:09.458 --> 38:10.458
Mowgli said that.

38:11.167 --> 38:12.792
Who the heck is Mowgli?

38:14.583 --> 38:16.583
Get it off! No! Ahh!

38:17.833 --> 38:19.292
You scared him.

38:20.542 --> 38:21.583
Great, that went well.

38:22.958 --> 38:24.500
Well, that could have gone worse.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.917
Right, time to train!

38:30.083 --> 38:31.042
Activate!

38:47.417 --> 38:50.042
Stepping in here makes
everyone nervous

38:50.125 --> 38:50.750
fear not.

38:50.875 --> 38:54.875
We'll train with a ball that's
only minimally charged.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.083
So now what? Do I hit it?

39:08.292 --> 39:09.292
Correct.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.458
Oh boy...

39:13.542 --> 39:15.000
OK, another one.

39:16.667 --> 39:17.542
Of course.

39:27.250 --> 39:29.000
In order for you to strike the ball

39:29.292 --> 39:31.125
you need to match its speed

39:31.208 --> 39:32.083
and to do that,

39:32.167 --> 39:36.625
you'll have to learn to control
your teleportation skills.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.167
Which were activated before a truck hit you.

39:39.417 --> 39:40.542
That's right

39:40.833 --> 39:41.750
I almost died.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.625
So it's fear
that caused your teleportation.

39:48.917 --> 39:52.500
I must return you to that state.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.500
OK. You wanna fight?
Is that it?

40:00.708 --> 40:03.792
Don't stop! That's it! That's it!

40:07.792 --> 40:11.167
Haha! I got away from that one.
I teleported.

40:12.917 --> 40:14.083
That hurt.

40:14.667 --> 40:18.417
You almost teleported.
But it's uncontrolled.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.667
In time you will learn how
to take charge and command your powers.

40:20.750 --> 40:22.958
Very well.
That's enough for your first day.

40:24.875 --> 40:25.833
Show me how?

40:26.083 --> 40:27.292
I'm afraid I can't do that.

40:27.750 --> 40:28.792
I don't have the ability to jump.

40:28.875 --> 40:29.833
Maybe I can help?

40:32.625 --> 40:33.375
Hug me.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.417
Uhhh. Why would I do that?

40:36.792 --> 40:38.917
I just figured that
if I teleported with you

40:38.958 --> 40:40.417
it would help you figure out
how it might work?

40:40.542 --> 40:43.542
Is there some kind of a middle ground
between carrot and stick?

40:43.917 --> 40:44.583
What's that?

40:45.042 --> 40:47.000
Hey! What's your problem?

40:47.667 --> 40:48.958
What did you say?

40:53.167 --> 40:55.458
You're not falling down
because I'm teleporting us

40:55.542 --> 40:57.417
to the same place at
a high frequency.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.042
You see – it isn't scary to hug!

41:12.583 --> 41:15.583
No! No! No!
Give me your hand!

41:15.750 --> 41:17.542
Teleport now
or get splattered!

41:17.625 --> 41:19.583
No! I can't do it!

41:19.708 --> 41:22.208
Concentrate, Anton.
You have to try.

41:22.292 --> 41:25.833
No, I can't! Ahhh!

41:31.917 --> 41:34.000
Are you crazy?
You could have killed me!

41:34.083 --> 41:35.667
You can't blame a girl for trying.

41:35.750 --> 41:36.750
That is enough! No more today.

41:38.792 --> 41:39.417
Wait.

41:40.917 --> 41:41.792
Let's do it again.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.458
Woo–hoo–hoo!
Now it's my turn!

41:45.208 --> 41:47.000
If heights and fights
didn't freak you out –

41:47.042 --> 41:48.042
let's give you something
a little more intense!

42:06.875 --> 42:07.958
Yes! That's right!

42:08.208 --> 42:10.333
Choose the point in space
and teleport to it!

42:15.958 --> 42:16.625
Again!

42:24.167 --> 42:25.625
Don't stop now! Go!

42:26.375 --> 42:28.417
Look! He has a blue trail!

42:29.292 --> 42:30.167
It's unusual for Earthlings!

42:30.292 --> 42:33.292
Controlled teleportation...
on the first day! Ha!

42:34.625 --> 42:35.792
OK, let's do this!

42:36.875 --> 42:37.708
Now hit the ball!

42:37.958 --> 42:39.292
And kick it away from you
if you can.

42:40.083 --> 42:41.750
The power of teleportation
is the same for every athlete

42:41.833 --> 42:43.042
no matter the size.

42:46.833 --> 42:47.708
Here we go.

43:15.750 --> 43:16.958
What just happened?

43:18.667 --> 43:19.792
Must be a glitch!

43:20.625 --> 43:21.875
I saw it too.

43:24.583 --> 43:25.500
Let's watch it again.

43:30.625 --> 43:31.458
He's using his hands!

43:32.167 --> 43:33.083
Like a goalkeeper.

43:33.292 --> 43:34.750
But we don't have a goalkeeper.

43:35.000 --> 43:35.708
Exactly!

43:37.625 --> 43:40.750
Five kicks in a row...
None of us can do that.

43:41.042 --> 43:42.167
I want to try it.

43:42.292 --> 43:43.750
Don't even think about it.

43:45.375 --> 43:46.833
We need to study this.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.375
Belo. At your request,

43:50.458 --> 43:52.750
the Galactic Council is on the line.

44:00.083 --> 44:01.083
You play tomorrow.

44:01.333 --> 44:02.875
- Seriously?
- The first two games, yes.

44:03.167 --> 44:04.125
Then we'll resume his training.

44:04.292 --> 44:06.750
Fan, Pele, you're with Anton.
Natasha, come with me.

44:09.958 --> 44:11.417
You're teaching me later.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.208
Let's go, keeper–man.

44:13.333 --> 44:16.042
We still have a problem.
We can't save his mother.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.583
Then she will die.

44:24.833 --> 44:28.083
Passing knowledge
to undeveloped nations is dangerous.

44:28.750 --> 44:29.708
And against the law.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.292
Then damn the foolish laws!

44:32.917 --> 44:36.083
Because if we don't help this man,
then we will lose the most gifted athlete

44:36.167 --> 44:37.792
I've ever encountered.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.333
His power is unbelievable.

44:40.458 --> 44:41.875
Beyond anything I have seen.

44:42.292 --> 44:45.042
His ability to teleport exceeds
that of every other Athlete

44:45.125 --> 44:47.833
and he has yet
to untap its full potential.

44:48.292 --> 44:48.958
This is...

44:49.208 --> 44:52.500
perhaps the next grand step
in humankind's evolution.

44:52.625 --> 44:56.250
it is our duty
to help and heal his mother.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.125
It is the right thing to do.

44:58.417 --> 45:01.500
With all due respect -

45:01.583 --> 45:04.292
So, I'm going to help her
whatever you decide.

45:22.667 --> 45:24.042
Can I teleport to the moon?

45:25.167 --> 45:26.417
I told you that I liked you.

45:26.667 --> 45:28.833
I've never been that honest
with anyone before.

45:29.333 --> 45:31.125
Don't you understand what that means?

45:32.375 --> 45:34.167
- You are honest.
- Of course I am!

45:34.875 --> 45:37.042
What more do I have to say
so that my feelings can get through

45:37.250 --> 45:39.458
that thick skull of yours
and you'll understand?

45:43.417 --> 45:44.167
So can I?

45:45.042 --> 45:48.208
Idiot. It would take too much energy.

45:48.333 --> 45:50.167
You'd either be stranded in space,

45:50.292 --> 45:51.833
or your atoms would kind of all just go...

45:52.042 --> 45:54.958
...Poof. And scatter everywhere out there.

45:57.333 --> 45:59.167
Probably shouldn't try then...

46:30.417 --> 46:31.917
You're all so different.

46:32.583 --> 46:33.958
And I don't mean young people.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.583
I'm talking about you, the Athletes.

46:37.250 --> 46:39.500
I was amazed to see
how easy it was for you

46:39.708 --> 46:42.792
to say to my son "Anton,
I like you"

46:43.292 --> 46:44.500
Try not to move too much.

46:44.583 --> 46:45.167
Sorry.

46:45.417 --> 46:46.083
Mom?

46:47.375 --> 46:48.250
Feeling better?

46:48.625 --> 46:49.250
Yeah...

46:49.458 --> 46:51.750
I feel I'm getting stronger.

46:52.292 --> 46:53.875
The biggest changes will come soon.

46:54.542 --> 46:56.167
Thank you. See!

46:57.292 --> 46:59.833
We've been waiting 20 years
for her to get better.

47:00.625 --> 47:01.250
Anton...

47:02.167 --> 47:03.500
Don't be rude to her.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.250
Don't get mad at him.

47:25.958 --> 47:27.875
I know that all mothers say it...

47:29.417 --> 47:31.250
But... he really is special.

47:33.458 --> 47:35.292
I was pregnant when the Moon split.

47:36.667 --> 47:38.583
I felt something pierce my belly.

47:39.375 --> 47:41.625
Tiny needle... ding!

47:45.125 --> 47:47.792
He started kicking inside me,

47:48.042 --> 47:49.250
and then everything went quiet.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.750
At first I was scared,

47:51.125 --> 47:53.375
but then I understood it was a sign.

48:06.333 --> 48:07.167
You Anton?

48:07.750 --> 48:08.417
Yeah.

48:08.667 --> 48:09.792
Anya's looking for you

48:10.625 --> 48:12.875
Asked me, to give you this.

48:13.625 --> 48:14.958
She said for you to find her.

48:42.792 --> 48:43.875
Anya!

48:48.708 --> 48:49.917
It's me, Anton!

48:54.792 --> 48:56.417
Anything alive down here?

48:57.000 --> 48:58.333
Aside from the mold...

49:02.417 --> 49:05.667
I wanted to ask you what you're using
to help cure your father.

49:11.750 --> 49:15.333
You... You aren't wearing pants.

49:15.917 --> 49:19.625
I mean that's cool
if you don't want to wear any.

49:19.750 --> 49:22.333
It's your house and all...

49:31.750 --> 49:32.750
You're an Athlete?

49:32.792 --> 49:33.958
I'm not going back there!

49:34.125 --> 49:34.958
Cool!

49:35.042 --> 49:37.042
They told me they'd help my mother,
but they lied.

49:37.125 --> 49:38.000
Is that true?

49:38.250 --> 49:39.667
Belo said so,
I heard it myself!

49:39.792 --> 49:41.417
Is it true the stadium's a plant?

49:43.583 --> 49:44.167
It is.

49:45.042 --> 49:45.875
Here.

49:46.750 --> 49:47.917
My father grew this.

49:48.458 --> 49:51.875
It's a pod that's filled with sap that
will poison any plant from within...

49:52.542 --> 49:53.833
Then they'll be no Cosmoball,

49:53.917 --> 49:55.833
and people will stop staring at the sky.

49:57.792 --> 49:58.875
Or have you changed your mind?

49:59.500 --> 50:00.667
No, I haven't.
It's just...

50:00.750 --> 50:02.333
there's a system that protects the plant -

50:02.583 --> 50:04.750
You can't bring in anything
that will hurt it.

50:05.708 --> 50:06.708
Ah, right.

50:06.958 --> 50:08.750
So you changed your mind after all.

50:09.750 --> 50:10.542
Wait, give it back!

50:11.375 --> 50:12.208
Give it to me.

50:15.083 --> 50:15.917
Stop it!

50:18.875 --> 50:19.792
Can you just...

50:30.750 --> 50:31.917
I've waited for this.

50:37.917 --> 50:39.458
Anton? What are you doing?

50:41.083 --> 50:44.292
We can't get....
out to the city.... alone...

50:45.125 --> 50:46.333
How'd you find me?

50:46.750 --> 50:47.875
Your Sputnik did...

50:50.083 --> 50:51.292
Go away!

50:52.250 --> 50:53.833
Such a star in my basement!

50:53.958 --> 50:55.292
We should go, Anton.

50:57.167 --> 50:58.250
She's right.

51:08.417 --> 51:09.875
Come back soon.

51:13.958 --> 51:14.958
Let's go.

51:32.875 --> 51:34.667
Weird... I've got a strange feeling.

51:34.750 --> 51:37.833
It's your Sputnik warning you
about a potential threat.

51:39.333 --> 51:42.833
In the name of the Moon restoration.
Stop where you are!

51:42.958 --> 51:45.208
Careful, sir or you'll trip and fall!

51:45.583 --> 51:47.500
The probability of danger
is less than 4 percent,

51:47.583 --> 51:49.417
which is why the Sputniks
didn't activate battle mode.

51:51.083 --> 51:52.167
It told you all that?

51:52.708 --> 51:53.458
Yes.

51:54.125 --> 51:56.667
Stop right there!
You're under arrest for the robbery

51:56.750 --> 52:00.500
of a drugstore
and assault on a police officer.

52:00.792 --> 52:02.333
I'll... Get you...

52:09.833 --> 52:11.000
Oh shut up!

52:13.125 --> 52:16.667
What happens... if a Sputnik
never actually says its name?

52:17.792 --> 52:20.458
It could... could...

52:21.625 --> 52:22.958
...and cost you your life...

52:25.125 --> 52:27.833
One day your Sputnik will try
to warn you about a threat

52:28.458 --> 52:31.208
and... if you haven't
established a connection...

52:31.292 --> 52:33.167
No foreign objects detected.

52:35.958 --> 52:37.625
...it will be too late...

52:39.208 --> 52:40.042
Get some sleep.

52:40.542 --> 52:42.875
The game is more dangerous
than it may seem.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.167
Look! The games are starting!

54:03.833 --> 54:06.333
You may not comprehend the
significance of what's transpiring today.

54:06.542 --> 54:09.292
For now that you join the ranks
of Athletes who become

54:09.375 --> 54:11.292
a small but exceedingly
important part of the army...

54:11.417 --> 54:12.792
Yes! Army!

54:13.167 --> 54:16.417
One that is tasked to inspire...
not only the Earthlings...

54:16.500 --> 54:18.708
but the rest of...
and why am I so nervous?

54:19.958 --> 54:21.417
I should have prepared this speech...

54:22.583 --> 54:24.958
Look! The point is that from today
the Earth team

54:25.042 --> 54:28.625
is playing with a complete team
and I congratulate you!

54:30.042 --> 54:31.583
So saddle up!

54:32.792 --> 54:34.000
Are we horses?

54:34.083 --> 54:35.583
Ehem... Yes?

54:35.958 --> 54:37.833
I didn't teach him that.

55:29.875 --> 55:32.625
Relax and imagine as if you
and your Sputnik are one.

55:55.583 --> 55:58.792
Excellent! Now that's settled,
your job is to cover Pele.

56:02.875 --> 56:04.167
Can I take this off?

56:04.250 --> 56:04.958
Of course.

56:05.542 --> 56:07.250
Ask your Sputnik to do it for you.

56:07.625 --> 56:08.875
Now let's go! Let's go!

56:09.042 --> 56:11.958
Anton goes first.
The crowd is waiting!

56:21.708 --> 56:23.417
If you need to pee,
it's the 6th pillar on the left!

56:23.500 --> 56:24.583
Don't get lost coming back!

56:27.625 --> 56:28.708
Alright. Glove off.

56:32.208 --> 56:33.542
Come on. Get off.

56:37.917 --> 56:39.833
Don't do this to me. Come on!

56:42.125 --> 56:43.167
What do you want me to do?

56:43.250 --> 56:44.167
Pretend to care again?

56:44.708 --> 56:45.875
Why does that even matter?

56:47.625 --> 56:48.292
To care...

56:50.000 --> 56:51.750
Why should I care?
I grew up alone.

56:52.083 --> 56:53.792
No one's ever
looked out for me but me.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.500
I grew up on the streets.

56:58.250 --> 56:59.458
It's just been me and my mom.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.750
And you don't even have a mom...

57:35.375 --> 57:37.875
Yeah, they're pretty big!

57:46.250 --> 57:47.625
Well, look who it is.

57:47.917 --> 57:49.167
They say he's cool!

57:53.917 --> 57:56.708
So you have a goalkeeper now?

58:07.292 --> 58:08.375
Heee... hello...

58:09.042 --> 58:10.833
You're very umm...

58:11.250 --> 58:12.042
Large.

58:12.250 --> 58:14.958
Don't run into my belly button, got it?

58:20.417 --> 58:21.708
I like you.

58:23.708 --> 58:29.792
All we have is now.
Might as well be honest. Hahaha

58:31.417 --> 58:32.333
Loudmouth!

58:32.583 --> 58:33.583
It wasn't me!

58:33.750 --> 58:35.625
I told them! Sorry...

58:36.375 --> 58:37.500
But they promised...

58:37.667 --> 58:39.292
Don't worry! We're cool.

58:42.167 --> 58:43.417
Jokers!

58:48.750 --> 58:50.292
It's a super–sized event today!

58:50.542 --> 58:51.792
For the first time in the finals

58:51.875 --> 58:53.958
and for the first time
it's four of them!

58:54.042 --> 58:55.375
Earth's team is complete!

58:55.458 --> 58:59.000
And listen to that!
Can you believe it?

58:59.167 --> 59:01.792
Four players! That's three plus one!
Two and two!

59:01.917 --> 59:03.833
That makes Four players
from planet Earth!

59:03.958 --> 59:06.333
What a day!
What a beautiful gorgeous day!

59:06.458 --> 59:07.750
We love you! Yes we do!

59:07.875 --> 59:09.875
We here and everyone,
without exception, envy you!

59:10.083 --> 59:13.458
Earthlings, Sirusians, Amazonians...

59:13.667 --> 59:15.583
...and all the other planets and galaxies,

59:15.708 --> 59:18.083
in one voice together,

59:18.167 --> 59:24.500
would like to welcome the new Athlete
Anton!

59:25.583 --> 59:29.250
Anton! Anton! Anton!

59:33.458 --> 59:36.292
Hold on! Is that ...? I think it's...

59:40.292 --> 59:42.125
They're showing Anton!

59:44.375 --> 59:45.333
Bless you!

59:45.958 --> 59:47.292
Thank you. Sorry...

59:53.875 --> 59:55.708
How about we grab dinner
after the game, Chickie?

59:55.792 --> 59:57.542
Uhh...Okay. Unless I'm dinner...

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:10.542
Ready?

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:54.958
Anton, what's wrong?

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.750
Salvo!

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.667
What's little chickie doing
sitting down there?

01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:15.417
What's going on?
What's he doing?

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:18.667
Get up... Get up... Get up...

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.375
Anton, are you OK?

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:24.750
His vital signs all seem normal.

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:28.542
Get up already!

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:35.000
What are you doing? Stop sitting!

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.042
Booo!

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:45.875
He's a quitter! He's a quitter!

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:51.708
What the hell!

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.167
What is this fool doing?

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:59.208
Let's not jump to conclusions quite so fast
getting call the boy a quitter

01:01:59.292 --> 01:02:02.958
after all, this is
his first game of Cosmoball.

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:05.208
It might just be a technical malfunction.

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.833
Get up. I'd like you
to come with me please.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:12.542
I'm not going anywhere!

01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:16.000
You lied to me.

01:02:16.417 --> 01:02:20.500
You said you were going to help my mom
and that all was just a lie.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.125
See for yourself, Anton.

01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:27.250
Belo got official permission from the Council
to use extraterrestrial medicine.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:28.750
She is already better.

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:31.292
When was the last time you saw her
so energized?

01:02:31.375 --> 01:02:33.042
Who is... she talking to?

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.292
Come with me.

01:02:48.792 --> 01:02:51.958
I never believed that I would play
a rookie on his first day.

01:02:52.083 --> 01:02:53.500
Much less show him this.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:09.667
What you've been practicing with

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.542
is a holographic ball
I created to train Athletes...

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:15.792
So they'd be ready...
for the real thing.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:27.333
This weapon is called a Wave Eater.

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:30.625
It was forged to consume energy.

01:03:34.417 --> 01:03:35.833
It cannot be destroyed.

01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:39.125
Only discharged
with the five strikes of an Athlete.

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:42.333
Millions were killed
before we discovered this method.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.333
Killed?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.625
Yes, Anton! It was war.

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.792
This stadium is not just a gaming center,

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:49.667
it also discharges Wave Eaters.

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:52.750
For years now we've been trying
to save Earth from total destruction.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.500
Why are they attacking us?

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:56.750
The Wave Eaters are a weapon.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:59.792
Controlled and commanded
by their creator - Cherno.

01:04:03.917 --> 01:04:06.500
He is imprisoned right here,
deep underground...

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:08.500
...Right under this stadium.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:09.917
He's scientist... Like me.

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:12.958
But he used this power
for his own personal gain...

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:15.625
...and turned his own experiments
into weapons that

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.875
threaten any life that was not
his own creation.

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.875
Harnessing the power of the stars,

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.708
he would turn the entire universe...

01:04:24.708 --> 01:04:26.667
into a playground, for his experiments.

01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:29.875
His last invention was the Protogene.

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:33.167
A combination of fused gene cells

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:35.750
including the power of teleportation,

01:04:36.042 --> 01:04:38.333
which could turn his weapon
into something unstoppable.

01:04:38.917 --> 01:04:39.958
So, we declared war.

01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:43.708
The final battle occurred
near your planet Earth.

01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:46.292
All the hardships Earth faced
in the past 20 years

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.167
are a result of the war with Cherno.

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:51.292
We won, but Cherno's lab
crashed through the ground

01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:52.708
and was trapped deep inside the Earth,

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:54.333
where we've kept him imprisoned.

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.583
Because Cherno hasn't escaped,
we assume his protogene

01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.667
was somehow
lost during the crash.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.417
You're saying that,
those balls out there

01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:07.375
are sometimes actually Wave Eaters
that could kill people?

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.750
Why make a game out of it?

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:14.083
It is easier to risk your life when you know
you are supported by millions

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:17.542
even if they don't know the truth
or understand the risk.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.708
And as for the three…

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:24.708
No... the four proud Athletes...

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.292
You show... everyone who watches you...

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.875
that there is something to be inspired by...

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:33.125
...you give them something to hope for...

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:37.875
Why can't we kill him?

01:05:38.583 --> 01:05:41.167
Drop some kind of gas into his prison
and destroy him that way.

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:43.083
If we do that, then
his lab would explode

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:44.750
and the planet would burst
just like the moon.

01:05:45.583 --> 01:05:46.750
This fact protects him.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.250
And the fans?

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:49.000
They're safe.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:51.542
The dandelion protects them
with a force field.

01:05:53.958 --> 01:05:56.042
So if the dandelion ship was not there,

01:05:56.167 --> 01:05:57.125
then the crowd...

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:02.958
This would happen to your entire planet
until it was a scorched wasteland.

01:06:05.458 --> 01:06:07.250
Wave Eater releasing in 1 minute.

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:08.917
– OK.
– Wait.

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:10.792
Let me get this straight.

01:06:11.542 --> 01:06:14.625
We're about to go play football
with what's essentially a nuclear bomb.

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:19.042
created by an angry alien who can't be killed
and wants to take over the universe...

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.583
and everyone else...
Thinks this is just a game...

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:23.958
Is that right?

01:06:25.958 --> 01:06:27.375
Pretty much it, yes.

01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:30.042
I think I have to go.

01:06:30.708 --> 01:06:31.208
What?

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.250
I'll be right back.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.625
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Faster! Faster!

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:50.625
Thank you!

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:12.125
Glove off.

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:40.708
Sputnik, connect me to the network.
Quick!

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:45.167
OK, fifteen seconds everyone.

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:57.833
Connect me to the network.
Come one!

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:01.917
Everyone! The Stadium is infected!

01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:10.833
It's not safe here!

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:12.667
Belo.

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:14.708
Belo!

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:17.832
The stadium's been infected!

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.167
Emergency evacuation!

01:08:55.417 --> 01:08:57.542
Emergency evacuation!

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:06.582
Let's get out!

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:09.832
Emergency evacuation!

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:21.457
We're stuck!
It won't let us go!

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:25.625
It's closing!

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.750
One!

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:51.167
Natasha.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.375
Two!

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:14.500
Three!

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:15.333
Four!

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:16.083
Too early!

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:19.542
No!

01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:25.708
Fifth!

01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:26.917
Five!

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.167
Anton. Are you OK?

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.333
We are fine!

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:51.833
You did great!

01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:02.875
Thought you were hit...
by the Wave Eater.

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.625
It's a miracle.
Take him to a doctor.

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:08.875
Hey, chickie.

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:11.833
You're the man.

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:13.250
You too – I mean...

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:14.333
Hey Anton!

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:16.042
Sweet moves!

01:11:18.917 --> 01:11:19.667
Congratulations!

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:27.375
Oh..

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:28.833
What?

01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:30.833
Nothing.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:49.875
Glove off

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:05.083
Sorry buddy!

01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:08.625
Gotta do this... on my own.

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:23.708
Anya...

01:12:28.792 --> 01:12:30.625
Don't struggle. It's useless.

01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:32.542
You won't be able to talk or move.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.375
A virus that imitates the genetic structure
of a dandelion.

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.542
So that's why the immune system
didn't recognize it.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.375
But how did Cherno
get it into the stadium?

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:40.375
Anton!

01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:43.750
Battle alarm!

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:00.708
There isn't a single being in the universe...

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:02.917
who knows you better than I do.

01:14:03.708 --> 01:14:06.458
It's me who brought all of your
troubles upon you.

01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:09.875
Falling objects.
The ground splitting beneath your feet.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.000
I was the one who placed
a box of lizards by your bed

01:14:12.208 --> 01:14:13.875
and ever since you've feared them.

01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:19.708
Your pure and frightened eyes

01:14:20.792 --> 01:14:23.083
watch me in my dreams almost
every night.

01:14:30.083 --> 01:14:31.333
My name is Valaya.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.833
I had always feared that you wouldn't like
the real me when you saw me.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.333
You like what you see?

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:49.667
It's because of you I went against
my father for the first time.

01:14:52.458 --> 01:14:55.333
If only you had destroyed
that stadium...

01:14:58.125 --> 01:15:01.583
...in the perfect world my father
will create...

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:04.292
...we could have been...

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.583
together...

01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:08.708
forever.

01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:14.542
But instead...

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.292
You failed me.

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:02.875
Finally!

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:47.958
Knock–knock!

01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:25.833
Say hello to... your master!
Hahaha!

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:35.125
This is... part of Cherno's lab.

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:41.542
Anton, are you OK?

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:45.667
My boy...

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:48.583
Tell me...

01:18:48.708 --> 01:18:50.250
you didn't poison the stadium...

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:57.167
I was me.

01:19:05.417 --> 01:19:06.875
Belo!

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.500
Belo!

01:19:13.292 --> 01:19:14.833
My creator.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:18.042
I'll give you a chance to save yourself.

01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:19.875
Come. join me.

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:31.042
He said that you were his creator.

01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:36.750
He must have somehow teleported!

01:19:37.042 --> 01:19:37.917
Everyone get ready!

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:51.875
He saved your life.

01:20:22.125 --> 01:20:24.125
It jumps just like Anton.

01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.583
Cherno...

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:57.375
Father.

01:20:57.875 --> 01:20:59.708
Watch and learn.

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:07.708
Fly!

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:17.917
Everybody gather around.

01:21:25.125 --> 01:21:27.083
The Galactic Council
needs to be informed.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.083
And you...

01:21:30.833 --> 01:21:32.583
You need to spread yourselves
around the city.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.458
The Wave Eaters will be here soon.

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:39.292
That's all.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.750
People of Earth.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:25.750
This is Belo.

01:22:26.917 --> 01:22:29.917
It's time...
you learn the truth about Cosmoball.

01:22:30.458 --> 01:22:32.958
It is not a game
But...a war.

01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:36.000
A war that you didn't ask for...

01:22:37.208 --> 01:22:38.625
but one that has found you anyway.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:40.792
I built my stadium ship
for one purpose..

01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:45.625
...to prevent the destruction of your planet.

01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:50.208
Quitter! Quitter! Quitter! Lalala!

01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:52.667
An evil being escaped
from captivity today,

01:22:52.917 --> 01:22:56.208
that can destroy the entire universe.

01:22:57.833 --> 01:23:01.292
All these years I have tried
to protect you from him...

01:23:01.875 --> 01:23:04.958
But I have failed.
Please forgive me.

01:23:06.667 --> 01:23:08.083
Today, like 20 years ago,

01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.875
the skies will rain fire,

01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:12.125
and destruction will come to Earth.

01:23:13.292 --> 01:23:14.708
But I have not given up hope.

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:17.417
I will do all I can to save this planet
and its people.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.708
Even though a regular human has no defense
against the power of a Wave Eater.

01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:24.083
The Athletes are here to protect you.

01:23:24.917 --> 01:23:27.083
And they need your help too.

01:23:29.083 --> 01:23:32.083
Together we will fight back
this menace.

01:23:32.792 --> 01:23:36.750
Because life is worth fighting for...

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:40.208
fighting for those you love.

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:50.458
Tell me if it hurts

01:23:55.417 --> 01:23:58.333
You don't have to say anything...
I deserve that.

01:24:10.167 --> 01:24:11.000
Anton!

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:13.167
They're leaving!

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:31.417
Mom... I really messed up.

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:33.583
Why did I...

01:24:35.417 --> 01:24:36.958
Don't worry, Anton.

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:40.375
I don't know
how it is on other planets...

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:44.458
But I know that on Earth,
people make mistakes.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.083
They make them all the time.

01:24:50.917 --> 01:24:54.667
But the strong people are those that
try to fix the mistakes they've made.

01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:02.792
I'm going to make something
for dinner.

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:14.833
His ship can absorb the energy
of anything we fire at it.

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:17.542
Our only hope is to set up a trap.

01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:19.250
Tell me why
he called you his creator?

01:25:21.167 --> 01:25:23.000
I thought I told you to stay on Earth.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:26.917
I'm with you.

01:25:28.292 --> 01:25:30.292
With me or away from him?

01:25:31.625 --> 01:25:33.500
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:37.708
You didn't answer.

01:25:43.292 --> 01:25:45.708
Why did he say that
you were his creator?

01:25:48.042 --> 01:25:50.125
You taught us to trust each other

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.667
My greatest failure...

01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:00.292
Forged in my image.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:04.208
I thought he would assist me
like your Sputniks do.

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.875
But I made a mistake...

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:11.375
Gave him feelings.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:14.417
I failed helping shape those feelings.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.542
Failed at being
his creator and father.

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:22.208
I avoided him and he began
to learn on his own.

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:26.833
The things that he studied were unsafe.
So, I banished him.

01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:28.375
That is why he escaped.

01:26:30.042 --> 01:26:31.417
And we know what happened...

01:26:31.917 --> 01:26:33.333
I failed to kill him...

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:48.833
My creations...

01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:53.875
Only the athletes can stop us now.

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:58.250
Keep them on the Earth
as long as you can!

01:27:27.792 --> 01:27:28.750
Save me your pie

01:27:33.208 --> 01:27:36.750
Alright girls, We can't let them
reach the city!

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:38.792
Moscow relies on us

01:27:44.042 --> 01:27:45.125
Boo at two o'clock.

01:27:48.042 --> 01:27:50.500
Stan at five!
Everything gonna be fine!

01:27:50.583 --> 01:27:51.917
– Fan at three
– Yu at twelve

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.792
– Vo at nine o'clock
– Pele at six.

01:27:54.667 --> 01:27:55.750
Keep the circle!

01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:01.375
Earthlings, the most dangerous
is two wave eaters...

01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:03.792
coming at you in a line.

01:28:04.083 --> 01:28:04.917
Be careful!

01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:06.333
It's OK! We'll get through!

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:10.875
Salvo!

01:28:11.542 --> 01:28:12.500
Salvo!

01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:15.125
Salvo!

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:15.875
Salvo!

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.500
Fan, get ready!
It's coming to you!

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.667
Got away to position twelve.

01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.792
Working on it!

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:20.583
Salvo!

01:28:20.667 --> 01:28:21.375
Fan, hold on!

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.333
Get ready, Vo!

01:28:23.042 --> 01:28:23.875
Oh gosh!

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.250
Salvo!

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:29.542
Don't overwhelm Fan!

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.500
I'm on it!

01:28:56.125 --> 01:29:01.625
Hmmm... The pathetic ships
of the galactic fleet...

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:03.833
Hahaha!

01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:09.250
20 years and still no progress!

01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:11.708
Charge primed, commander.

01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:13.458
Then begin!

01:29:31.708 --> 01:29:32.958
What the...

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:11.083
It's just us now.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.125
Don't overheat! Don't overheat!
Don't overheat!

01:30:24.292 --> 01:30:25.417
Salvo!

01:30:26.125 --> 01:30:26.833
Salvo!

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.625
Mine, mine, mine!

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:29.375
Salvo!

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.417
Fan, it's yours!

01:30:33.125 --> 01:30:34.042
Missed it!

01:30:35.333 --> 01:30:36.542
Salvo!

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.083
Ahh!... Ahh!

01:30:39.417 --> 01:30:40.917
Fan got hit by a wave!

01:30:46.083 --> 01:30:47.333
Fan, hold on!

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:49.333
How are you feeling?

01:30:50.083 --> 01:30:51.542
Fan, answer me!

01:30:51.875 --> 01:30:52.875
Are you wounded?

01:30:53.167 --> 01:30:54.292
Are you contused?

01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:56.833
Fan, please, tell me something!

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:03.042
I'm okay.

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.292
Working on position one!

01:31:06.417 --> 01:31:06.958
Mine!

01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:09.708
Salvo!

01:31:24.042 --> 01:31:25.500
Don't leave home without a snack!

01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:45.083
Please wait for me.
I will be back soon.

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:47.667
I got to fix something...

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.292
Please don't give up.

01:31:56.417 --> 01:31:57.917
'We be of one blood ye and I.'

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:03.125
That was Mowgli.

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.083
He saved your life.

01:32:29.875 --> 01:32:31.167
It isn't scary to hug.

01:32:32.333 --> 01:32:33.958
I told you that I liked you.

01:32:58.083 --> 01:32:59.583
Mowgli.

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:01.458
Anton.

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:20.625
Help me!

01:33:28.917 --> 01:33:30.625
It's not scary to hug!

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:32.625
Remember that...
for the future.

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:47.875
What are you doing?

01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:52.708
I'm covering your back, Pele!

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:00.042
Protect Fan!

01:34:17.083 --> 01:34:18.583
Forget it!

01:34:21.875 --> 01:34:23.875
Forget it. It's war!

01:34:24.542 --> 01:34:25.875
I like you!

01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:29.000
All we have is now.

01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:32.042
You don't have to say anything!

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.042
Wait for me!

01:34:35.625 --> 01:34:36.875
I like you too.

01:34:37.417 --> 01:34:38.542
A lot.

01:34:40.333 --> 01:34:42.667
I want to... protect you.

01:34:43.417 --> 01:34:45.667
Come on. We have to go!

01:34:51.792 --> 01:34:53.167
I'm fine, Anton.

01:34:54.125 --> 01:34:55.333
I can still fight.

01:34:55.667 --> 01:34:57.542
You did a great job.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.458
I'll take your place now. Rest.

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.208
Are we going to win?

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:07.958
– Of course.
– I'm glad you're back.

01:35:08.042 --> 01:35:09.000
Me too.

01:35:18.667 --> 01:35:20.833
Hold this... Let's go!

01:35:21.708 --> 01:35:22.708
This way!

01:35:30.542 --> 01:35:31.333
Come on!

01:35:39.083 --> 01:35:40.458
We'll wait here!

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:42.333
We'll be safe!

01:35:47.083 --> 01:35:50.750
Keep moving! Nobody stop! Let's go!

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:53.250
Officer please look after her!

01:35:53.917 --> 01:35:55.333
She needs rest and water.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.250
Got it?

01:35:56.333 --> 01:35:57.875
Can I... Get an autograph?

01:35:58.292 --> 01:35:59.000
Later.

01:35:59.083 --> 01:36:00.292
– Stay strong.
– Anton...

01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:08.625
Natasha! Natasha!

01:36:08.708 --> 01:36:10.125
Two Wave Eaters in a row.

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:12.083
Watch out, guys. Watch out!

01:36:12.292 --> 01:36:13.083
Two of them...

01:36:13.833 --> 01:36:15.917
Anton! Fan! Watch out!
They're coming your way!

01:36:16.542 --> 01:36:19.542
Wait! Wait!
He can't hear without his helmet!

01:36:19.833 --> 01:36:22.083
Attention everyone!
Two Wave Eaters in a row!

01:36:27.958 --> 01:36:28.958
Salvo!

01:36:42.333 --> 01:36:43.875
Look! A Sputnik!

01:36:44.583 --> 01:36:45.583
Where is it going?

01:37:04.875 --> 01:37:05.792
Mowgli!

01:37:42.792 --> 01:37:43.542
Take this.

01:37:48.417 --> 01:37:50.417
The ship will now
obey your every command.

01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:52.417
If I don't make it back alive,

01:37:53.208 --> 01:37:55.625
go back to Earth and save
everyone you can.

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:01.750
But you can leave him if you want.

01:38:13.542 --> 01:38:15.958
Guys, Natasha! I am
not a traitor!

01:38:16.333 --> 01:38:18.208
I wanted to say sorry.
I was an idiot!

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:21.250
Natasha just went after Cherno!
Get back into position!

01:38:23.542 --> 01:38:24.333
Combat mode!

01:38:25.542 --> 01:38:26.292
Mowgli!

01:38:28.042 --> 01:38:29.500
Let's try this again.

01:38:46.833 --> 01:38:49.250
You discharged
a Wave Eater with one hit!

01:38:50.167 --> 01:38:51.417
You okay man?

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:54.750
I'm not really sure yet.
Watch me!

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.708
How are you doing that?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.375
I have no idea.

01:39:10.792 --> 01:39:13.458
But I'm gonna kick their butts
for as long as I can!

01:39:23.167 --> 01:39:25.750
You're doing a great job, little chickie.

01:39:31.292 --> 01:39:33.542
You should never teleport
beyond your line of sight.

01:39:35.125 --> 01:39:36.167
Belo?

01:39:40.625 --> 01:39:42.208
If he dies...

01:39:42.542 --> 01:39:43.875
...The whole thing explodes.

01:39:44.333 --> 01:39:45.875
Please, get back in time.

01:39:46.125 --> 01:39:47.750
Earthlings need their captain!

01:39:48.292 --> 01:39:51.792
You still cower from the thing
you've created.

01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.833
I didn't force you to do this.

01:39:56.958 --> 01:39:58.750
I've forgotten what you look like.

01:40:04.833 --> 01:40:05.667
Helmet.

01:40:15.833 --> 01:40:19.750
Ahhh... Now there you are.

01:40:23.458 --> 01:40:24.667
You are the only one–

01:40:24.792 --> 01:40:27.750
–who can truly appreciate
the inventions I've created.

01:40:28.417 --> 01:40:33.042
Which will replace all
that exists in this universe.

01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:35.875
But first ... you will show me

01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:37.792
what you have done
in all these years.

01:40:39.125 --> 01:40:43.583
Don't tell me you've wasted your time
with hatred of me.

01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:47.167
If saving the universe
from a madman who wants

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.333
to destroy it is a waste of time
in your mind...

01:40:49.833 --> 01:40:50.833
...then yes.

01:40:54.625 --> 01:40:56.917
Twenty years...

01:40:57.875 --> 01:41:00.375
I've waited for this moment.

01:41:02.458 --> 01:41:04.833
Twenty years!

01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:12.458
I had thought we could have a chat...

01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:14.833
longer!

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:22.542
Get her!

01:41:24.333 --> 01:41:26.125
You have forgotten, Belo!

01:41:26.208 --> 01:41:30.542
You created me much stronger
that yourself!

01:41:30.625 --> 01:41:34.542
That is how you die today!

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:46.958
She said I couldn't.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:54.792
Natasha!

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.083
It wouldn't have worked...you and him...

01:42:40.125 --> 01:42:40.958
No!

01:42:43.917 --> 01:42:45.583
Noooo!

01:42:45.833 --> 01:42:49.583
You could never match my genius!

01:43:22.542 --> 01:43:25.958
Everybody. Make some space.

01:43:26.250 --> 01:43:28.708
Save some water! Breathe rarely!

01:43:28.792 --> 01:43:29.542
Now...

01:43:30.292 --> 01:43:31.833
Children protect us.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.625
Come on. Let's go.

01:43:33.792 --> 01:43:34.500
Is she alive?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.083
We have to fight!

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:44.875
Fight.

01:43:46.458 --> 01:43:47.875
For those we love.

01:44:01.875 --> 01:44:04.125
Grab a weapon! Come with me!

01:44:17.625 --> 01:44:18.417
Come

01:44:25.917 --> 01:44:29.833
Do you know what I've dreamt
of all these years?

01:44:32.083 --> 01:44:34.833
That I'd finally face you
and say

01:44:34.958 --> 01:44:35.958
"Father,

01:44:37.042 --> 01:44:38.917
Farewell."

01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:03.875
You think you're capable...
Of killing her?

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:07.542
My dear child.

01:45:09.042 --> 01:45:11.125
She has never been a perfect creation.

01:45:22.083 --> 01:45:27.833
You can not teleport
until I order to let you go!

01:45:30.542 --> 01:45:34.917
Your powers belong to me!

01:45:35.667 --> 01:45:38.875
And I will take them back from you!

01:45:42.542 --> 01:45:44.000
Now's your chance.

01:45:53.208 --> 01:45:55.500
The ship is made of your cells.
Talk to it!

01:46:48.042 --> 01:46:50.083
Roaring! Biting! Killing!

01:46:50.333 --> 01:46:52.500
Is that your life philosophy?

01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:16.375
We are of the same blood...

01:47:16.708 --> 01:47:17.708
Listen to me!

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.583
You're just a little kid...

01:47:57.583 --> 01:47:58.625
Hey kid.

01:48:09.833 --> 01:48:10.708
Don't cry.

01:48:13.375 --> 01:48:14.542
We need your help.

01:48:17.125 --> 01:48:18.750
Earthling...

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.750
No way...

01:48:31.125 --> 01:48:32.125
What's happening?

01:49:03.208 --> 01:49:04.000
No!

01:49:04.208 --> 01:49:05.167
Don't you dare!

01:49:05.333 --> 01:49:06.292
I am your master!

01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:08.000
I created you!

01:49:08.542 --> 01:49:11.750
No. No! No!

01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:19.250
Hey!

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:39.917
Hey!

01:49:46.542 --> 01:49:47.292
Helmet...

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:51.208
Hey!

01:49:53.042 --> 01:49:54.875
Captain, it was an honor
to serve with you!

01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:56.125
We need to go.

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.750
It's time to show them
what we're made of!

01:50:26.292 --> 01:50:27.000
See that?

01:50:27.958 --> 01:50:29.917
It's a fireball, captain.

01:50:30.792 --> 01:50:33.125
It looks like victory!

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.542
And that's how we do it
in the Police!

01:50:58.708 --> 01:50:59.958
The danger has passed.

01:51:01.125 --> 01:51:02.833
And harnessing the energy of the remaining
Wave Eaters will enable us

01:51:02.917 --> 01:51:04.750
to restore life on Earth

01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:07.083
and resuscitate our environment.

01:51:09.042 --> 01:51:11.333
It's time to live, not just survive.

01:51:21.083 --> 01:51:22.208
Natasha!

01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:39.625
Looks similar...

01:51:48.750 --> 01:51:50.792
See! The Moon is amazing!

01:51:51.583 --> 01:51:54.667
We have survived the harshest
20 years of human history.

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:58.042
And we know now that it is together
with our courage and ability

01:51:58.708 --> 01:52:02.042
to never give up hope

01:52:02.667 --> 01:52:03.833
To prove it...

01:52:04.375 --> 01:52:06.708
Belo sacrificed his life for us.

01:52:07.792 --> 01:52:10.542
For us and for our planet

01:52:12.583 --> 01:52:15.458
Time to work,
no staring at the sky!

01:52:17.417 --> 01:52:18.625
And the invasion
of the red dogs is really

01:52:18.708 --> 01:52:20.333
similar to the attacks
of the Wave Eaters...

01:52:20.583 --> 01:52:21.083
Guys!

01:52:21.208 --> 01:52:23.500
Be careful. The microphone
could have still been on.

01:52:23.583 --> 01:52:24.542
...Kipling predicted everything.

01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:26.750
I'll put it here.

01:52:30.667 --> 01:52:32.250
Look. Visitors.

01:52:39.333 --> 01:52:40.875
Here to arrest me?

01:52:43.208 --> 01:52:43.833
No, no.

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:47.375
The Police are dropping
all charges against you

01:52:47.458 --> 01:52:49.292
for your services
in saving the Planet.

01:52:51.792 --> 01:52:54.042
We forgive you for robbing the drugstore.

01:52:54.708 --> 01:52:55.625
I'm here to...

01:52:56.875 --> 01:52:58.167
Ah... yeah..

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.667
Well, you know... I want to...

01:53:03.167 --> 01:53:03.792
...marry

01:53:03.875 --> 01:53:04.625
Vasya.

01:53:05.667 --> 01:53:06.750
Basically, Anton...

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.333
if you don't want to call me "dad"

01:53:09.458 --> 01:53:10.292
I understand

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.167
OK... Captain...

01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:15.250
Congratulations!

01:53:15.375 --> 01:53:16.042
So you two...

01:53:16.792 --> 01:53:17.792
Great!

01:53:17.875 --> 01:53:19.042
These are my friends!

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:19.958
This is Pele

01:53:20.333 --> 01:53:21.833
This is Fan
and this is...

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:24.667
That's Mowgli.

01:53:24.792 --> 01:53:25.750
And where is kid?

01:53:25.875 --> 01:53:27.583
Kid? Kid?

01:53:29.208 --> 01:53:29.958
Holy cow!

01:53:30.333 --> 01:53:31.250
Vasya!

01:53:36.875 --> 01:53:38.208
And of course there is...

01:53:38.708 --> 01:53:39.583
Natasha.

01:53:40.542 --> 01:53:41.750
She is the girl that I...

01:53:43.708 --> 01:53:44.958
The girl that you love.

01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:50.458
Teleported!

01:53:53.292 --> 01:53:56.792
I have such a big family now!

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:00.958
I'm sorry for calling you names before.

01:54:01.667 --> 01:54:03.417
Ah, that's OK, son.
