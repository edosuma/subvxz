WEBVTT

00:10.611 --> 00:12.136
Wow.

00:13.688 --> 00:15.422
You guys all look how I feel.

00:17.391 --> 00:20.493
Happens when your worst day
is immortalized in print.

00:20.528 --> 00:21.761
Bad karma.

00:21.796 --> 00:23.396
Bad karma for what?

00:23.431 --> 00:25.398
We were all just staring
to groove, weren't we?

00:25.433 --> 00:27.067
I should have never doubted myself.

00:28.870 --> 00:30.837
I should have gotten there sooner.

00:30.872 --> 00:33.506
My personal life affected
my decision-making.

00:33.541 --> 00:35.675
Guys, I should have made
a diagnosis sooner.

00:35.710 --> 00:37.777
But we can't just sit here
beating ourselves up over it.

00:37.812 --> 00:39.398
- Okay?
- I feel like we can.

00:40.615 --> 00:41.681
Or at least I can.

"Yesterday morning, at 7:38 a.m.,

01:01.068 --> 01:03.737
a bullet ripped through New Amsterdam."

01:03.764 --> 01:08.780
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

01:12.480 --> 01:15.115
I got dinged for not changing
my patient's TV channel

01:15.149 --> 01:16.883
fast enough.

01:16.918 --> 01:19.052
Apparently my name brings
back bad memories.

01:19.086 --> 01:20.587
I get it.

01:20.621 --> 01:22.389
The customer satisfaction
survey isn't good.

01:22.423 --> 01:24.057
- So rewrite the survey.
- What?

01:24.091 --> 01:25.425
If you don't like the answers,

01:25.459 --> 01:26.593
change the questions.

01:26.627 --> 01:27.894
What should the patients focus on?

01:27.929 --> 01:30.730
Nurses know better than anyone.

01:30.765 --> 01:31.932
Harold.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.900
You're a long way from the morgue.

01:33.935 --> 01:36.736
Oh, the ICU has the only
decent coffee in the hospital.

01:36.771 --> 01:38.738
You know, I may work with the dead,

01:38.773 --> 01:40.573
but that doesn't mean I have their taste.

01:40.608 --> 01:43.443
Well, I say equal coffee now,
equal coffee forever.

01:45.212 --> 01:47.113
It's a joke, Harold.
We'll get you the same coffee.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.182
Sharpe, why does nobody get my jokes?

01:49.216 --> 01:52.152
You just missed me solve the
hospital's most vexing problem.

01:52.186 --> 01:54.120
That the ICU has the only decent coffee?

01:54.155 --> 01:56.523
So that is actually a thing?

01:56.557 --> 01:58.591
- Are you heading out?
- I was.

01:58.626 --> 01:59.859
When did that happen to your voice?

01:59.894 --> 02:02.028
On my day off. That'll teach me.

02:02.063 --> 02:05.765
You don't think the, uh,
"Nutella" is spreading, do you?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.767
I hope you don't expect me
to call it that.

02:07.802 --> 02:09.636
Why? Everyone loves Nutella.

02:09.669 --> 02:11.671
Let me do a laryngoscopy
and see what's going on

02:11.706 --> 02:13.606
with the, uh... Nutella.

02:13.641 --> 02:14.607
See? It's catchy.

02:14.642 --> 02:15.942
Dora.

02:15.977 --> 02:17.644
Getting exceptionally good at finding me.

02:17.678 --> 02:19.546
I've updated your tracking device.

02:19.580 --> 02:21.815
Whatever it is that you wanna
tell me or want me to do,

02:21.849 --> 02:23.616
I can't do it 'cause I have a thing.

02:23.651 --> 02:25.018
My thing trumps your thing.

02:25.052 --> 02:26.720
- Find me later.
- Okay.

02:26.754 --> 02:30.156
Max, this is Louis Navarro
from the "Standard."

02:30.191 --> 02:32.301
Apparently HCC approved him
to shadow you.

02:32.336 --> 02:35.228
Right, yes. For the, um, profile.

02:35.262 --> 02:36.730
Overlord told me.

02:36.764 --> 02:38.465
- Overlord?
- HCC.

02:38.499 --> 02:40.033
Your supervisors.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.735
Who doesn't like a fun nickname?

02:41.769 --> 02:43.136
Probably HCC.

02:43.170 --> 02:44.871
Do you have a contentious relationship

02:44.905 --> 02:45.972
with the Health Care Commission?

02:46.007 --> 02:47.841
Off to a great start.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.676
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go start

02:49.710 --> 02:51.011
posting my rÃ©sumÃ©.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.281
Do you?

02:53.180 --> 02:55.849
Why don't we start over?

02:55.883 --> 02:57.150
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Navarro.

02:57.184 --> 02:58.477
No, Lou.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.987
So intrigued to meet the 'Dam's
newest medical director

03:01.022 --> 03:02.655
turning this place upside-down.

03:02.690 --> 03:03.656
Well, I'm an open book.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.374
Hey, is, uh, your voice okay?

03:06.408 --> 03:09.262
Karaoke. You know, one of these
days, I have to accept that

03:09.296 --> 03:10.930
"Total Eclipse of the Heart"
just isn't in my range.

03:14.135 --> 03:16.836
- Pan roasted whole branzino.
- Mm-hmm.

03:16.871 --> 03:19.039
Served with ramps and fiddleheads

03:19.073 --> 03:21.574
steeped in an unctuous maitake jus.

03:21.609 --> 03:24.010
- What are fiddleheads?
- I have no idea.

03:24.045 --> 03:25.178
But I'm gonna order them tonight.

03:25.212 --> 03:26.746
- Mmm.
- Maybe even twice.

03:26.781 --> 03:28.681
Taking Martin to Verdugo for dinner.

03:28.716 --> 03:30.583
No kids.

03:30.618 --> 03:32.018
You know, I think once a year,
it's important to go somewhere

03:32.053 --> 03:33.853
that doesn't have a maze on the menu.

03:33.888 --> 03:35.508
- You know what I mean?
- Dr. Kapoor?

03:35.543 --> 03:36.683
Am I needed?

03:36.718 --> 03:37.729
There's somebody here to see you.

03:37.764 --> 03:39.202
He said he's your son.

03:40.127 --> 03:41.342
Who?

03:41.377 --> 03:43.930
- Your son?
- Wait, you have a son?

03:47.935 --> 03:49.463
Hey, hey.

03:50.004 --> 03:51.304
You have a son?

03:52.403 --> 03:53.606
Vijay.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.076
Vijay.

03:58.279 --> 04:02.148
Hmm... not good.

04:03.851 --> 04:08.254
You only have five eggs...
oh, maybe six in play,

04:08.289 --> 04:09.956
in your ovulation cycle.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.959
Ten is considered normal.

04:12.993 --> 04:15.655
There's a few weeks left in my cycle.

04:16.096 --> 04:17.831
Others could still catch up.

04:17.865 --> 04:20.502
Yes, in theory, they could, but...

04:20.536 --> 04:22.302
I'm a late bloomer.

04:22.336 --> 04:25.905
School, my chest, men.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.472
These eggs will come round.

04:28.506 --> 04:32.011
Helen, you said you wanted to
know where your fertility was.

04:32.046 --> 04:34.341
Well, here it is.

04:35.116 --> 04:36.950
Your FSH is high.

04:36.984 --> 04:41.431
Your AMH is low because
your ovaries are aging fast.

04:41.956 --> 04:45.325
You have diminished
ovarian reserves, which...

04:50.631 --> 04:51.831
Hey.

04:53.472 --> 04:55.935
Hey, it's just the genes you were dealt.

04:55.970 --> 04:58.338
Yeah, right.

05:05.728 --> 05:07.162
If you're interested in having your own

05:07.196 --> 05:09.798
biological child,
you're gonna have to work

05:09.832 --> 05:11.199
on that now.

05:11.233 --> 05:14.135
One option, we freeze embryos.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.771
Or we could work to start
getting you pregnant

05:16.806 --> 05:17.939
as soon as your next cycle.

05:19.642 --> 05:21.176
So, um...

05:21.210 --> 05:23.178
You're going to have to make
some decisions on this.

05:26.482 --> 05:29.117
That piece that you wrote on the uh, uh,

05:29.151 --> 05:31.519
corporatization of health care
for the "Times" was great.

05:31.554 --> 05:33.688
Oh, you remember that?
That was a decade ago.

05:33.723 --> 05:36.157
Yeah, but my favorite is
the one you wrote on the, uh,

05:36.192 --> 05:38.893
uh, inadequacies of...
of maternal postpartum care.

05:38.928 --> 05:40.729
Mm, also ten years ago.

05:40.763 --> 05:43.231
Yeah, why aren't you writing
pieces like that anymore?

05:43.265 --> 05:45.200
Well, you know,
the market now demands shorter,

05:45.234 --> 05:46.701
buzzier topics.

05:46.736 --> 05:48.670
But the health care system demands more.

05:48.704 --> 05:50.672
Okay, yeah, let's...
let's talk about you.

05:50.706 --> 05:52.240
Your story. How you got here.

05:52.274 --> 05:54.976
Lou, I'm flattered,
but I'm not the story here.

05:55.011 --> 05:56.678
New Amsterdam is.

05:56.712 --> 06:00.815
Mm, the only thing new
about New Amsterdam is you.

06:00.850 --> 06:03.651
Now, HCC gave me full access
to follow you around

06:03.686 --> 06:06.187
- the entire hospital.
- Full access?

06:06.222 --> 06:08.226
Anywhere in the hospital is fair game.

06:08.261 --> 06:09.657
Max.

06:09.692 --> 06:14.029
Did you know that HCC
gave Lou full access?

06:14.063 --> 06:16.264
The Chief of Police just called.

06:16.298 --> 06:18.445
It's... it's bad.

06:23.806 --> 06:26.608
Malik Stokes, 14-year-old
GSW to left and right.

06:26.642 --> 06:29.017
It seems like a through and through.
Scoop and go.

06:29.051 --> 06:30.678
He's tachy at 120, 100 over 68,

06:30.713 --> 06:31.913
respiration's at 16.

06:31.947 --> 06:33.214
Jesus, he's just a kid.

06:33.249 --> 06:35.183
Hey, Malik, I'm Dr. Bloom, okay?

06:35.217 --> 06:36.551
We're here to help you.

06:36.585 --> 06:38.086
Malik?

06:39.955 --> 06:40.955
I'm here, baby.

06:40.990 --> 06:44.759
Malik? Malik?

06:44.794 --> 06:46.961
I'm right here, baby. I'm here, baby.

06:46.996 --> 06:48.797
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

06:48.831 --> 06:50.131
He can't die like this.
You have to save him.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.566
He can't die...

06:51.600 --> 06:53.535
Escort her out of here, please.

06:53.569 --> 06:56.104
Okay, transfer on my count.
One, two, three.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.774
Second ambulance coming in.

06:59.809 --> 07:01.876
Type and cross two units
and get a second IV.

07:04.313 --> 07:06.081
Jalen Pagan.

07:06.115 --> 07:09.607
17-year-old GSW with a bullet hole
on the left side of his neck.

07:09.642 --> 07:12.287
98, 145 over 85, 14.

07:12.321 --> 07:14.055
He was on the same corner
as the first victim.

07:14.090 --> 07:15.590
According to NYPD, only one shot.

07:15.624 --> 07:16.724
One bullet.

07:16.759 --> 07:17.926
Must have been some bullet.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.127
Okay, let's get him into bay 24.

07:21.664 --> 07:23.998
Jalen, can you wiggle your toes for me?

07:25.801 --> 07:27.260
Okay, that's great.

07:27.294 --> 07:29.737
Malik's BP is dropping.
Heart rate is rising.

07:29.772 --> 07:31.306
Okay, hang two bags of normal saline.

07:31.340 --> 07:32.674
Let's get a type and cross match.

07:32.708 --> 07:33.895
On it.

07:34.677 --> 07:36.911
Heart rate's climbing now to 154.

07:36.946 --> 07:39.013
And BP's dropping. 80/40.

07:42.051 --> 07:43.651
Muffled heart sounds.

07:43.686 --> 07:45.120
Malik's got a pericardial effusion.

07:45.154 --> 07:47.088
Fluid must be accumulating
around his heart.

07:47.123 --> 07:49.190
Heart rate's gone from 100 to 160.

07:49.225 --> 07:51.326
Okay, if we don't do
a pericardiocentesis soon,

07:51.360 --> 07:54.262
his BP will bottom out.
Where's cardiothoracic surgery?

07:54.296 --> 07:56.851
- Reynolds is ten minutes out.
- What about one of his new hires?

07:56.886 --> 07:58.867
All three have been scrubbed
for their own surgeries.

08:00.336 --> 08:01.669
BP's dropping again.

08:03.139 --> 08:04.339
Okay, I'll do it.

08:04.373 --> 08:06.207
Uh, get me an 18-gauge spinal needle

08:06.242 --> 08:08.343
and a 20-cc syringe. Go.

08:11.347 --> 08:13.982
- It's against protocol.
- What do you want me to do?

08:14.016 --> 08:16.351
Wait until he's pulseless
so I can call time of death?

08:17.887 --> 08:19.821
Get me an 18-gauge spinal needle

08:19.855 --> 08:21.789
and a 20-cc syringe. Now.

08:29.765 --> 08:31.132
Heart rate's up to 180.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.041
Get a second IV bag.

08:43.179 --> 08:44.746
O2 sats are dropping.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.215
Steady. Steady.

08:50.352 --> 08:52.053
- BP's dropping.
- I got it.

08:54.123 --> 08:55.990
- You're in the heart.
- Heart rate's rising.

09:01.363 --> 09:03.443
Damn it.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.477
Max, you're not walking
towards your office.

09:10.511 --> 09:12.275
I'm walking to the ED where the GSWs are.

09:12.309 --> 09:13.843
What about Chief Williams?

09:13.877 --> 09:15.478
Well, last time I checked,
he wasn't shot.

09:15.512 --> 09:17.347
He... he's just gonna call again.

09:17.381 --> 09:18.781
Well, I'll ignore that call,
too, and then eventually,

09:18.816 --> 09:20.149
he'll stop dialing.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.552
He doesn't dial his own phone.

09:22.586 --> 09:24.120
You normally in the habit of blowing off

09:24.154 --> 09:25.521
the Chief of Police?

09:25.556 --> 09:27.557
Oh, the police department
has its own agenda.

09:27.591 --> 09:30.226
But my agenda and the agenda of
my hospital is to save lives.

09:30.260 --> 09:31.494
Plain and simple.

09:31.528 --> 09:32.628
Yeah, you realize this is probably

09:32.663 --> 09:34.230
a police-related shooting, right?

09:34.264 --> 09:35.865
That information,
while tragic and upsetting,

09:35.899 --> 09:39.836
- doesn't matter in here.
- Wait, doesn't matter?

09:39.870 --> 09:42.238
More than 700 people have been
shot and killed by the police

09:42.272 --> 09:43.806
just this year.

09:43.841 --> 09:45.341
And the second they come
through these doors,

09:45.376 --> 09:46.809
they become patients, not statistics.

09:46.844 --> 09:48.478
Okay, hold on. Wait.

09:48.512 --> 09:50.579
If you wanna do a ride-along with
the police, then you go ahead.

09:50.614 --> 09:52.515
But in here, the hospital is the story.

09:55.853 --> 09:57.854
When exactly did you
become a cardiac surgeon?

09:57.888 --> 10:00.250
When we were waiting on you. On anyone.

10:00.285 --> 10:02.258
'Cause you're still
so insanely understaffed.

10:02.292 --> 10:03.826
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

10:03.861 --> 10:06.496
- Supposed to follow protocol.
- He would have crashed.

10:06.530 --> 10:08.331
You pushed that needle
way too deep into his heart

10:08.365 --> 10:10.166
'cause you are not a cardiac surgeon.

10:16.573 --> 10:18.274
You better hope I can fix this.

10:26.784 --> 10:31.156
Ms. Tewkes. Can you talk to me?

10:32.489 --> 10:34.690
Ms. Tewkes? Ms. Tewkes.

10:34.725 --> 10:36.759
At what point did you see the officers...

10:36.794 --> 10:38.294
Uh, hang on. Hang on there.

10:38.328 --> 10:40.863
Just one sec. I'm sorry to
cut in on you, Officer...

10:40.898 --> 10:42.565
Detective. Adams.

10:42.599 --> 10:43.866
NYPD. And you're?

10:43.901 --> 10:45.301
Frome. NAMC.

10:45.335 --> 10:46.702
New Amsterdam Medical Center.

10:46.737 --> 10:48.871
It's, uh, it's a mouthful, I know.

10:48.906 --> 10:51.374
Um, I'm gonna need you to give
Ms. Tewkes a little room here.

10:51.408 --> 10:52.642
I just need a few statements
from the aunt there.

10:52.676 --> 10:53.976
No, I understand, but we're just...

10:54.011 --> 10:55.411
We're gonna do our thing first, okay?

10:55.446 --> 10:56.679
Thank you. I'll bring her back.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.949
Are you one of Malik's surgeons?

10:59.983 --> 11:02.585
Um, no. No.

11:02.619 --> 11:04.454
Here. Come in here.

11:04.488 --> 11:06.556
No, I'm, uh... I'm a psychiatrist.

11:06.590 --> 11:08.724
I'm on Malik's trauma support team.

11:08.759 --> 11:10.560
I'm Iggy Frome.

11:10.594 --> 11:12.829
What does he need with a psychiatrist?

11:12.863 --> 11:14.597
- Is he out of surgery?
- No.

11:14.631 --> 11:15.832
No, not yet. Um...

11:15.866 --> 11:18.634
But, uh, if his surgery is a success,

11:18.669 --> 11:20.603
he's gonna need more
than physical rehabilitation.

11:20.637 --> 11:23.239
There will be many, many
mental hurdles to overcome.

11:23.273 --> 11:24.959
So you don't know how he is now?

11:26.944 --> 11:28.644
No.

11:28.679 --> 11:31.674
But, um, I can assure you that he's in...

11:34.885 --> 11:36.686
He's in the best hands.

11:39.356 --> 11:40.957
<i>Yo, that's so bugged.</i>

11:40.991 --> 11:42.625
Word to, son.

11:42.659 --> 11:45.151
It's all good, though.
Your boy bulletproof.

11:45.185 --> 11:46.762
<i>How are you bulletproof
with a bullet hole, B?</i>

11:46.797 --> 11:48.331
<i>You sound dumb-smacked.</i>

11:48.365 --> 11:49.432
You're just jealous.

11:51.301 --> 11:52.768
Why is Jalen Pagan still here?

11:52.803 --> 11:55.169
- Why do you sound like a frog?
- Allergies.

11:55.204 --> 11:56.772
Why hasn't he been sent for an MRI?

11:56.807 --> 11:58.508
He's got a bullet lodged near T1.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.276
Yes, but he's stable, and he's a minor.

12:00.310 --> 12:01.644
So we're trying to contact
his mother for consent.

12:01.678 --> 12:03.279
It's an MRI.

12:03.313 --> 12:04.947
I'm just following protocol.

12:04.982 --> 12:06.482
I mean, I wouldn't wanna piss
anyone off overstepping

12:06.517 --> 12:07.850
any precious rules, would I?

12:07.885 --> 12:09.754
Gonna say no.

12:10.988 --> 12:12.284
How long have the cops been circling?

12:12.319 --> 12:15.291
A while now. They want a statement
from Jalen like yesterday.

12:15.325 --> 12:16.993
Not till we reach his parents.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.831
Yo, what's up, guys? Jalen's gotta go.

12:21.865 --> 12:23.533
We gotta call his mom, okay? Thanks, bye.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.368
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

12:25.402 --> 12:27.069
It's for your own good.
Now, help me call your mom.

12:38.882 --> 12:40.201
You need money?

12:43.520 --> 12:44.998
I have a job.

12:45.856 --> 12:47.375
It's at a restaurant.

12:48.525 --> 12:50.026
Solsistce, in SoHo.

12:51.795 --> 12:53.863
It's new, but it's making noise.

12:53.897 --> 12:55.398
A restaurant.

12:55.432 --> 12:57.400
Yeah, I manage the place.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.515
I mean, it's no big deal. Just...

13:06.543 --> 13:08.010
Why were you hiding all this?

13:10.480 --> 13:11.514
I don't know.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.519
It's weird enough,
me showing up like this, but...

13:19.056 --> 13:20.923
After I got your voice mail, I...

13:23.660 --> 13:25.621
Rohan, I'm...

13:26.396 --> 13:28.097
I'm glad you came.

13:31.841 --> 13:33.208
I forgive you.

13:35.472 --> 13:36.772
You forgive me?

13:36.807 --> 13:38.885
Yes, for...

13:39.643 --> 13:42.712
For the funeral, for all the lies.

13:42.746 --> 13:44.914
For everything.

13:44.948 --> 13:46.684
You forgive me?

13:47.684 --> 13:51.053
Isn't that what people
like you need to hear?

13:53.090 --> 13:56.110
You know, my sponsor said not to...

13:57.027 --> 13:58.594
Not to expect...

14:01.531 --> 14:02.732
Never mind.

14:04.701 --> 14:06.802
- But I don't understand...
- Yeah, of course you don't.

14:06.837 --> 14:09.572
You know, Maji was right.
You are just so pigheaded.

14:09.606 --> 14:10.940
Nothing is ever your fault.

14:10.974 --> 14:12.975
You know, I was hoping you might change

14:13.010 --> 14:14.577
just a little after she passed.

14:14.611 --> 14:15.578
But you're still you.

14:17.948 --> 14:19.582
Good-bye, Appa.

14:25.989 --> 14:27.823
Ms. Tewkes, can you tell me about Malik?

14:31.061 --> 14:32.194
Rhonda.

14:32.229 --> 14:34.430
What? Why are you still talking?

14:34.464 --> 14:35.965
I'm just trying to learn
more about Malik's

14:35.999 --> 14:36.999
home support system.

14:37.034 --> 14:38.934
He's not some charity case.

14:38.969 --> 14:40.436
No, no, I didn't mean to imply...

14:40.470 --> 14:42.538
Malik has been well-loved.

14:42.572 --> 14:44.707
And extremely well cared for.

14:44.741 --> 14:46.142
Is that what you need to hear?

14:46.176 --> 14:48.611
- It's good.
- Church choir.

14:48.645 --> 14:51.013
After-school care. Year-round sports.

14:51.048 --> 14:54.483
I've done everything
in my power to keep him safe.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.852
To keep him from dying like his parents.

14:58.155 --> 15:00.122
This foolishness still found him.

15:01.992 --> 15:03.826
I'm genuinely just here trying to help.

15:05.662 --> 15:07.963
If you really wanna help,

15:07.998 --> 15:10.966
then stop the police
from shooting black boys

15:11.001 --> 15:13.479
trying to get to school on time.

15:14.037 --> 15:18.074
And get every bullet out of this city.

15:18.108 --> 15:21.744
So my nephew has a chance
of seeing his 21st birthday.

15:23.246 --> 15:25.748
Can you do that, Mr. Trauma Support Man?

15:27.584 --> 15:28.818
So we should start.

15:28.852 --> 15:31.020
Excuse me one minute.

15:31.054 --> 15:33.189
- I got your page.
- Have you been crying?

15:33.223 --> 15:35.257
Do you want this laryngoscopy or not?

15:35.292 --> 15:36.759
What's a laryngoscopy?

15:38.862 --> 15:40.162
Just call me when you're free.

15:42.099 --> 15:45.768
So, Lou, what's the story?

15:45.802 --> 15:48.838
Well, it seems your purge of
the cardiac surgery department

15:48.872 --> 15:51.107
has resulted in, uh, staffing shortages.

15:51.141 --> 15:54.009
That the new department head
is thoughtfully refilling.

15:54.044 --> 15:56.712
Yeah, apparently not fast
enough to stop a breach

15:56.747 --> 16:00.015
of protocol by one of your
department chiefs.

16:00.050 --> 16:02.084
The doctor stuck a needle way too deep

16:02.119 --> 16:04.186
into Malik Stokes' heart.

16:04.221 --> 16:05.888
Now, it's very possible
he could die from this.

16:05.922 --> 16:07.890
Now, do you have a comment?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.507
Uh, you gonna fire Dr. Bloom?

16:21.541 --> 16:23.352
Who said anything about firing?

16:23.386 --> 16:25.749
Well, if Malik dies because
she broke protocol...

16:25.784 --> 16:27.284
I only care if what she did helped him.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.752
We're in the business of healing.

16:28.787 --> 16:30.321
And if protocol gets in the way of that,

16:30.355 --> 16:31.589
then we will change the protocol.

16:31.623 --> 16:33.457
Oh, can... can I quote you on that?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.126
I just assumed all this
was on the record.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.327
- Max.
- Really?

16:36.361 --> 16:37.495
The police chief? Still?

16:37.529 --> 16:38.662
No, the Mayor. Congratulations.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.464
You've moved up in the world.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.681
He wants an update on the injuries

16:41.715 --> 16:43.200
and the kind of bullet that was used.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.502
I don't wanna talk to him either.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.143
Any idea why he would wanna know that?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.310
Yeah, but his agenda is not your story.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.446
Hospital is, remember?

17:02.754 --> 17:04.355
Hello, Jalen.

17:04.388 --> 17:06.323
I'm Dr. Vijay Kapoor.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.872
Would you mind wiggling
your toes for me, please?

17:08.906 --> 17:10.027
I already did a work-up, Vijay.

17:10.060 --> 17:11.362
The bullet stays.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.196
Sending him up to the ward
for observation.

17:13.231 --> 17:15.665
- Jalen, go ahead.
- I am.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.647
Okay, tell me
if you feel something, okay?

17:22.674 --> 17:24.208
Yeah.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.845
- Pull his X-rays.
- Sure thing.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.586
Dr. Hartman, he has ascending paralysis.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.555
That just started.
It's probably from edema.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.423
I already had them start
on methylprednisolone.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.692
It's not edema.
His vertebrae is unstable.

17:41.726 --> 17:44.094
You're a surgeon. Fix it.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.696
What's got you riled up today?

17:45.730 --> 17:47.331
A neurologist advocating
for a construction project?

17:47.365 --> 17:48.732
Because it's indicated.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.401
These scans don't say that definitively.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.069
If you actually look, they do.

17:52.103 --> 17:53.571
You're being stubborn.

17:53.605 --> 17:55.873
Okay, let's wait for the
bloody vertebrae to collapse

17:55.907 --> 17:57.408
for proof!

18:00.579 --> 18:01.645
What?

18:03.741 --> 18:05.041
Prep him for surgery.

18:10.322 --> 18:12.690
You coming, John Wayne?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.745
See, there? No trace wave.

18:34.779 --> 18:36.780
So all that blood must have
come from where the bullet

18:36.815 --> 18:38.415
nicked his heart, not my needle.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.817
And you needed a video to tell you that?

18:39.851 --> 18:41.619
Oh, I needed something, okay?

18:41.653 --> 18:43.721
I'm second-guessing every
move I make in there now.

18:43.755 --> 18:45.889
Do you think that Reynolds
sits around whingeing

18:45.924 --> 18:47.224
about the calls that he makes?

18:49.361 --> 18:50.461
No.

18:50.495 --> 18:51.795
What is it?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.931
They need a hematology consult in the OR.

18:53.965 --> 18:55.466
- Malik?
- No.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.301
The other GSW, Jalen.

19:01.673 --> 19:03.898
Infusion rate is .5 mils per minute.

19:05.543 --> 19:07.144
It won't clot.

19:07.178 --> 19:08.812
Blood keeps oozing
into my surgical field.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.814
And you've got an expanding hematoma.

19:10.849 --> 19:12.562
It's because Kapoor pressed
for stabilizing rods.

19:12.596 --> 19:13.784
That you know he needed.

19:13.818 --> 19:15.419
But now I can't close,
so we should have waited.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.187
And let him because paraplegic?

19:17.222 --> 19:18.656
For goodness' sake,
will you both give it a rest?

19:18.690 --> 19:20.924
Push calcium chloride
before giving him FFP.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.693
That should stabilize
the oozing while I run

19:22.727 --> 19:24.862
a detailed clotting factor analysis.

19:36.641 --> 19:37.993
Hi.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.811
Hi.

19:41.846 --> 19:43.249
I will, um...

19:44.516 --> 19:47.384
Freely admit that I'm
stress-eating right now.

19:47.419 --> 19:48.986
Ruining my appetite
for what will surely be

19:49.020 --> 19:50.988
a very expensive meal
with my husband later.

19:51.022 --> 19:52.690
I didn't see anything.

19:52.724 --> 19:53.757
Thank you.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.694
What's wrong with your voice?

19:56.728 --> 19:59.730
Ah, it's the, uh, big game.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.933
- The... What big game?
- Why are you stress-eating?

20:05.670 --> 20:08.372
They're out there right now
for Malik and Jalen.

20:08.406 --> 20:11.742
But tomorrow,
it's gonna be another family

20:11.776 --> 20:14.511
crying, scared, praying.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.116
And this happens every day.

20:19.918 --> 20:22.319
And Malik and Jalen could end
up here again through no fault

20:22.354 --> 20:24.254
- of their own.
- Yeah.

20:24.289 --> 20:27.658
Maybe, but you do what you can in here,

20:27.692 --> 20:30.994
maybe make a difference out there.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.673
I don't see how.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.965
Malik lives in a war zone.

20:36.968 --> 20:39.013
Both of his parents are dead.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.004
His aunt is...

20:42.941 --> 20:46.777
Fraying at the seams, and she's angry.

20:46.811 --> 20:47.945
Distracted.

20:47.979 --> 20:50.514
You seem very focused on Malik.

20:50.548 --> 20:51.582
Of course I am.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.237
Sounds like Malik
isn't your only patient.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.638
Blood pressure dropped again.

21:14.672 --> 21:16.940
Come on, Malik.
Where is that damn bleeder?

21:20.038 --> 21:21.378
Wipe.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.751
Nottingham, is this abdomen distended?

21:29.587 --> 21:31.555
I don't feel anything.

21:31.589 --> 21:32.938
Cut the drapes.

21:40.665 --> 21:42.633
He's got Grey Turner's sign
on his abdomen.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.805
Because it's full of blood.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.941
That's where that bleeder is, damn it.

21:50.975 --> 21:52.910
Prepare to expand the surgical
field to the abdomen.

21:52.944 --> 21:54.645
Shouldn't we call the general surgeon?

21:54.679 --> 21:56.173
If we're hitting the spleen...

21:57.115 --> 21:58.916
He's bleeding out fast,
and I'll be damned if this kid

21:58.950 --> 22:00.984
dies on my watch.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.519
Ten blade.

22:13.631 --> 22:15.532
Scrub in. STAT.

22:21.139 --> 22:22.940
Where's the barnacle?

22:22.974 --> 22:25.342
Probably writing an exposÃ©
about our coffee situation.

22:25.376 --> 22:26.643
Well, I can scope you now.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.978
I'm just waiting on Jalen's test results.

22:28.012 --> 22:29.379
What's going on with you?

22:29.414 --> 22:30.606
- Nothing.
- Red eyes earlier.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.849
Now you're mean-mugging.

22:31.883 --> 22:35.786
Helen, you know
my biggest, hairiest secret.

22:35.820 --> 22:38.088
So if you need to talk to me...

22:40.692 --> 22:43.037
You're the one with the "Nutella."

22:43.072 --> 22:44.561
Not me.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.964
So let's just do the scope
before you get another page.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.665
Max!

22:48.700 --> 22:50.033
I said I ain't giving you my phone!

22:50.068 --> 22:51.668
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is the problem?

22:51.703 --> 22:53.570
The name's Javier Pagan.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.372
We found him filming in the ED.

22:55.406 --> 22:56.740
Yeah, because that's where
y'all took my brother...

22:56.774 --> 22:58.141
- Okay, okay.
- And now he isn't there!

22:58.176 --> 22:59.710
Hey, who is your brother?

22:59.744 --> 23:02.045
How many people I gotta tell? Jalen.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.309
- Okay.
- Jalen Pagan.

23:03.343 --> 23:04.848
He was shot in the back.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.684
But now nobody wants to tell
me where y'all took him!

23:07.719 --> 23:10.053
My mom keeps calling me trying
to get here from her job.

23:10.088 --> 23:11.722
Keeps asking me for news
that I can't give her!

23:11.756 --> 23:13.190
I understand...

23:13.224 --> 23:14.758
And now I got these two
dumb-ass rent-a-cops

23:14.792 --> 23:16.026
getting spicy over a damn phone!

23:16.060 --> 23:17.194
I understand. Calm down.

23:17.228 --> 23:18.762
Calm down. Listen, listen, listen!

23:18.796 --> 23:20.397
You're gonna come with me.

23:20.431 --> 23:22.032
We're gonna talk about
your brother, okay?

23:22.066 --> 23:23.700
You need to make sure
he didn't film any hospital

23:23.735 --> 23:24.935
personnel or patients. It's policy.

23:24.969 --> 23:26.203
You are making this worse.

23:26.237 --> 23:28.605
What? You think I'm scared?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.073
- Huh?
- Back up.

23:30.108 --> 23:31.441
Okay? It's okay.

23:31.476 --> 23:33.010
No, no. You think I'm scared?

23:34.612 --> 23:36.213
- Are you gonna shoot me, too?
- It's okay.

23:37.248 --> 23:38.882
Easy, man.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.517
- Are you gonna shoot me too?
- Calm down, son.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.952
- Back off.
- You need to calm down.

23:41.986 --> 23:44.755
Hey, hey, just back... give him space!

23:44.789 --> 23:46.890
Max!

23:50.662 --> 23:52.029
No!

24:20.281 --> 24:22.549
If I'd have known that punching
you in the face was all it took

24:22.583 --> 24:24.384
to make you available,
I'd have done it myself.

24:25.953 --> 24:27.620
How long for the test results?

24:27.655 --> 24:29.589
I'll have them in the morning.

24:29.623 --> 24:31.758
In the meantime, I was thinking a course

24:31.792 --> 24:33.960
of steroids might help clear the, uh...

24:37.064 --> 24:38.565
Steroids.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.767
What?

24:40.801 --> 24:42.902
- I have to go.
- What about me?

24:42.937 --> 24:44.771
Here. Heal thyself.

24:47.408 --> 24:48.875
Changing out the CO2 absorber.

24:48.909 --> 24:50.610
Hanging a bag of cryoprecipitate.

24:50.644 --> 24:52.812
- Hanging.
- Tests come back?

24:52.847 --> 24:54.647
No, but Jalen isn't clotting

24:54.682 --> 24:57.083
because he's on anabolic steroids.

24:57.118 --> 24:58.952
Seems a bit out of left field.

24:58.986 --> 25:00.620
Not if you've seen
his brother or factor in

25:00.654 --> 25:01.988
Jalen's damaged liver.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.556
But his liver function tests were normal.

25:03.591 --> 25:04.991
Appear normal.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.626
But his protein levels
tell the whole story.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.628
I confirmed his A/G ratio
is less than one.

25:08.662 --> 25:10.296
He's on steroids.

25:10.331 --> 25:11.664
We should wait for
the tests to come back.

25:15.002 --> 25:16.002
4 mils per minute.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.470
Wait, wait.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.774
It's drying up.

25:22.710 --> 25:23.860
It's working.

25:25.679 --> 25:26.813
Well done, Sharpe.

25:32.853 --> 25:34.854
Hi. Just me.

25:34.889 --> 25:36.122
What happened?

25:36.157 --> 25:37.624
Uh, nothing.

25:37.658 --> 25:39.826
Malik is still in surgery.

25:39.860 --> 25:42.495
But, um, I thought you might
appreciate a fresh

25:42.530 --> 25:43.734
set of clothes.

25:44.365 --> 25:46.466
- Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.801
And I've said all I had
to say about Malik

25:47.835 --> 25:49.169
in all of this.

25:49.204 --> 25:51.671
Well, I'm actually not here
to talk about Malik.

25:51.705 --> 25:53.106
I'm here to talk about you.

25:58.546 --> 26:00.013
Hey, how'd you earn the shiner?

26:00.047 --> 26:02.204
Can't be Medical Director
at the 'Dam without at least one.

26:03.551 --> 26:05.485
Hey, listen, my contact
at the mayor's office

26:05.519 --> 26:06.986
says they want to hold
a press conference.

26:07.021 --> 26:09.556
It's about what the bullet did
to both Malik and Jalen.

26:09.590 --> 26:10.761
Of course they are.

26:11.425 --> 26:13.059
You going to?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.994
You're getting caught up
in the shiny thing again, Lou.

26:15.029 --> 26:16.863
Yeah, but you get to talk
about your agenda.

26:16.897 --> 26:18.631
Tell your story.

26:18.666 --> 26:21.467
I would love nothing more
than to tell people

26:21.502 --> 26:23.036
what hollow points do to flesh.

26:23.070 --> 26:25.572
How the bullet blooms inside of you,

26:25.606 --> 26:27.707
expanding to three times its size.

26:27.741 --> 26:30.176
How it breaks apart,
tearing through flesh,

26:30.211 --> 26:33.533
pulverizing bones, liquefying muscles.

26:34.748 --> 26:37.537
Just not for the mayor.

26:37.885 --> 26:39.873
Aren't you on the same side?

26:40.921 --> 26:42.755
The mayor's been campaigning the police

26:42.790 --> 26:44.057
to use different bullets.

26:44.091 --> 26:46.059
He wants me to influence public opinion.

26:46.093 --> 26:49.863
I pick a side between
the mayor and the police,

26:49.897 --> 26:52.565
all of a sudden there's less
patrolling in our neighborhood

26:52.600 --> 26:55.168
or a... or a grant we were
assured gets diverted

26:55.202 --> 26:56.736
to another hospital.

26:57.805 --> 27:00.477
There are no safe sides.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.777
So what are you gonna do?

27:04.812 --> 27:08.944
Lou, what are we gonna do with you?

27:09.617 --> 27:11.584
Let me guess.

27:11.619 --> 27:12.886
It's not the story.

27:14.255 --> 27:15.688
May be hope for you yet.

27:23.497 --> 27:24.931
PTSD.

27:28.135 --> 27:30.103
I'm not a soldier. I haven't been to war.

27:31.972 --> 27:35.108
PTSD can occur from any traumatic event.

27:38.245 --> 27:40.613
Seeing your nephew get shot,
that would be more than enough.

27:40.648 --> 27:43.917
But it most likely triggered
other traumatizing memories

27:43.951 --> 27:45.063
for you.

27:45.653 --> 27:46.986
It can make sleeping hard.

27:48.088 --> 27:49.789
Sudden noises can be jarring.

27:51.759 --> 27:53.126
Same thing happened to my kids.

27:55.629 --> 27:57.664
Yeah.

27:57.698 --> 28:00.667
We, uh, we adopted them
from Bangladesh two years ago.

28:04.872 --> 28:06.626
When we first got them here,

28:07.841 --> 28:09.379
they were terrified.

28:10.044 --> 28:11.144
Of everything.

28:12.646 --> 28:15.815
Car horns, school bells.

28:17.718 --> 28:22.223
Crowded spaces, everything.
They were just... petrified.

28:24.959 --> 28:28.261
All five of us slept
in the same bed for months.

28:28.295 --> 28:32.265
And they would just
wake themselves crying.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.702
Night after night after night.

28:37.204 --> 28:39.605
When was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

28:42.710 --> 28:44.010
Never.

28:47.748 --> 28:49.649
I just thought that was life.

28:51.986 --> 28:53.553
It doesn't have to be.

28:55.823 --> 28:56.991
I can help you.

29:01.195 --> 29:02.695
And then you can help Malik.

29:09.336 --> 29:10.570
Yeah.

29:18.178 --> 29:20.646
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:20.681 --> 29:22.244
Malik's surgery all good?

29:22.850 --> 29:26.819
Yeah, it was a bit dicey,
but he's gonna pull through.

29:26.854 --> 29:29.446
I was just, uh, going to tell his family.

29:29.481 --> 29:31.090
Yeah, they just closed Jalen as well.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.387
Oh.

29:32.422 --> 29:33.659
Score one for the good guys, huh?

29:33.694 --> 29:35.261
I suppose.

29:35.295 --> 29:38.231
Never felt good about fixing
bullet holes in anyone.

29:38.265 --> 29:40.566
Let alone kids, you know?

29:40.601 --> 29:43.336
That's something I will never
understand about this country.

29:45.639 --> 29:47.907
The dangers of walking
around in brown skin?

29:47.941 --> 29:49.942
I never really gave it much
thought until I moved here.

29:49.977 --> 29:51.878
Now I can't not think about it.

29:51.912 --> 29:56.282
Yeah, well, unfortunately
it's a lesson we learn early.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.567
But this is no way to live.

29:58.602 --> 29:59.919
No.

30:01.889 --> 30:04.724
It's not. Yet we do.

30:04.758 --> 30:05.758
You know?

30:07.428 --> 30:11.764
So if it takes a million
camera phones and protests

30:11.799 --> 30:16.419
and knees to make that point, so be it.

30:36.990 --> 30:38.825
I didn't mean to do all that.

30:38.859 --> 30:40.960
Seriously. I'm so sorry.

30:40.994 --> 30:42.628
It's just, Jalen is my little brother.

30:42.663 --> 30:44.063
- And I only got one.
- Don't worry about it.

30:44.098 --> 30:45.198
Really.

30:47.167 --> 30:48.634
I have a sister.

30:48.669 --> 30:49.735
I get it.

30:54.675 --> 30:55.942
So am I being arrested?

30:58.779 --> 31:00.383
I have a better idea.

31:01.181 --> 31:03.303
How about we go see your brother instead?

31:04.017 --> 31:05.985
His surgery went well.

31:09.957 --> 31:11.645
He's in recovery now.

31:16.029 --> 31:18.030
Just easy on that elbow.

31:18.065 --> 31:19.899
Yeah.

31:25.139 --> 31:27.006
My mom's gonna be so hyped
when she gets here.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.674
- Jalen's the baby.
- Yeah?

31:28.709 --> 31:30.710
A little badass too.

31:30.744 --> 31:32.378
Once he poured ketchup
all over his T-shirt.

31:32.412 --> 31:33.980
Acted like he got shot.

31:34.014 --> 31:35.214
Scared the crap out of my moms.

31:35.249 --> 31:36.482
He got the chancla for that one.

31:36.517 --> 31:38.017
No doubt.

31:38.051 --> 31:39.719
He's always pulling
stupid stuff like that.

31:42.022 --> 31:43.289
- What... What's going on?
- Stay here.

31:43.323 --> 31:45.324
- Where's Jalen?
- Javi, look at me.

31:45.359 --> 31:47.426
I need you to stay out here.

31:52.733 --> 31:54.233
He's in pulseless electrical activity.

31:54.268 --> 31:55.701
- Chest compressions?
- Gomez.

31:55.736 --> 31:57.036
Max, one milligram of epi.

32:00.274 --> 32:01.974
No, it's already open.

32:02.009 --> 32:03.376
- V-fib.
- Go.

32:06.246 --> 32:07.713
Clear.

32:09.116 --> 32:11.329
- Still V-fib.
- Another round of epi.

32:11.952 --> 32:13.085
Clear.

32:21.094 --> 32:22.495
No pulse.

32:26.934 --> 32:28.401
Still no pulse.

32:37.544 --> 32:39.412
- Max.
- Wait.

32:44.084 --> 32:45.451
- Max.
- Just wait!

32:51.959 --> 32:53.192
Stop it, Max.

32:59.233 --> 33:00.423
Stop it.

33:04.238 --> 33:05.271
It's over.

33:11.812 --> 33:13.312
Time of death, 3:18.

33:31.832 --> 33:35.934
<i>Damn, you saw Mami face?
Unstoppable, you heard me?</i>

33:35.968 --> 33:37.602
<i>Oh, man, stop fronting.</i>

33:37.636 --> 33:40.247
<i>You know I'm the brains of the operation.</i>

33:40.310 --> 33:41.944
<i>What brains, man?</i>

33:41.979 --> 33:43.346
<i>What brains? Oh, yeah?</i>

33:55.325 --> 33:57.143
I heard Malik is stable.

34:00.397 --> 34:01.497
And, um...

34:04.688 --> 34:08.791
Jalen died of cardiac arrest
secondary to a gunshot wound.

34:11.313 --> 34:13.534
So you gonna call the Chief of Police?

34:16.179 --> 34:17.612
Mayor?

34:18.895 --> 34:20.295
It's not the story, Lou.

34:22.284 --> 34:23.920
Well, then... then what is?

34:24.911 --> 34:26.846
And what is the story if it's not you,

34:26.871 --> 34:28.871
the police, or the mayor?

34:29.059 --> 34:31.159
If you don't know after spending all day

34:31.194 --> 34:34.030
at this hospital,
then I picked the wrong man

34:34.063 --> 34:35.364
for the job.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.268
Wait, you picked me?

34:41.538 --> 34:43.304
So HCC didn't give me full access.

34:43.340 --> 34:44.373
You did.

34:48.764 --> 34:50.431
Did they even want me here at all?

34:58.294 --> 34:59.747
Why did you?

35:05.429 --> 35:06.996
Gotta see the truth.

35:08.972 --> 35:10.675
To write the truth.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.439
<i>Unstoppable, you heard me?</i>

35:16.473 --> 35:18.574
<i>Oh, man. Stop fronting.</i>

35:18.608 --> 35:21.077
<i>You know I'm the brains of the operation.</i>

35:33.490 --> 35:35.057
<i>Get off, man. That's not funny.</i>

35:35.092 --> 35:36.392
<i>It's not funny. No brains.</i>

35:36.426 --> 35:37.560
<i>No brains.</i>

35:38.662 --> 35:40.429
<i>âª Too blind</i>

36:13.463 --> 36:18.234
<i>âª So how's it gonna be</i>

36:20.767 --> 36:21.833
<i>âª When it all</i>

36:21.867 --> 36:23.581
Hey, Martin, it's me.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.242
Do you think I could take a rain
check on date night tonight?

36:26.276 --> 36:27.743
I just, um...

36:27.778 --> 36:29.311
I really wanna be with you and the kids.

36:37.654 --> 36:39.421
You know, there might not have even been

36:39.456 --> 36:42.350
a patient to save if I hadn't
done the pericardiocentesis.

36:43.727 --> 36:46.128
Yeah, and I wanted to tell
you that you did it perfectly.

36:46.163 --> 36:47.564
I know I did.

36:48.111 --> 36:51.234
I didn't need... nor would
I ask... for your opinion.

36:52.302 --> 36:54.036
Look, Floyd, you're an incredibly gifted

36:54.070 --> 36:56.639
doctor who heads up
a world-class department.

36:56.673 --> 36:57.949
But so am I.

36:58.675 --> 37:01.013
Yeah. You're right.

37:04.214 --> 37:05.707
So we're good?

37:06.516 --> 37:07.750
I don't know.

37:08.585 --> 37:09.618
Are we?

37:09.653 --> 37:11.049
I mean, I don't know.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.464
I really don't want no static
at work after this.

37:14.324 --> 37:15.383
Agreed.

37:17.260 --> 37:19.461
Well, you sound like you're
still in your feelings, so...

37:19.496 --> 37:21.397
Oh, my God.

37:21.431 --> 37:23.566
You just can't help yourself, can you?

37:23.600 --> 37:26.502
You know, for the record,
the spleen is way outside

37:26.536 --> 37:27.937
of cardiac's protocol.

37:28.605 --> 37:32.408
<i>"Yesterday morning, at 7:38 a.m.,</i>

37:32.442 --> 37:35.477
<i>a bullet ripped through New Amsterdam."</i>

37:37.113 --> 37:41.117
<i>"The bullet tore doctors apart.</i>

37:42.719 --> 37:45.521
<i>It tore families apart."</i>

37:47.290 --> 37:49.658
<i>"It tore communities apart."</i>

37:59.236 --> 38:03.038
<i>"It tore Jalen Pagan's body apart."</i>

38:10.069 --> 38:13.182
"And although the hardworking
doctors of New Amsterdam

38:13.216 --> 38:18.354
couldn't save Jalen's life,
they all did their job."

38:19.589 --> 38:22.558
<i>âª How's it gonna be</i>

38:22.592 --> 38:26.265
"Except the bullet did its job better."

38:27.597 --> 38:29.732
<i>âª To cycling trivialities</i>

38:29.766 --> 38:31.267
That is the truth.

38:33.270 --> 38:36.805
Not one of you is at fault.

38:39.476 --> 38:41.610
Not one of you is to blame.

38:46.211 --> 38:48.518
I know you could all
be working someplace else.

38:49.218 --> 38:50.978
Making...

38:52.289 --> 38:53.656
Making more money.

38:53.690 --> 38:55.658
<i>âª Cycling trivialities</i>

38:55.692 --> 38:57.259
Working less hours.

39:00.497 --> 39:01.797
But you're here.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.802
And I'm so grateful.

39:10.540 --> 39:13.632
Today is a new day.

39:21.217 --> 39:22.418
Go.

40:00.357 --> 40:03.059
The "Nutella" didn't spread.

40:09.733 --> 40:11.834
I should stop calling it Nutella.

40:14.604 --> 40:17.866
It's not Nutella. It's cancer.

40:19.743 --> 40:23.412
I should start being honest.

40:25.682 --> 40:26.915
At least with myself.

40:32.352 --> 40:34.356
I want to have a baby.

40:36.292 --> 40:37.259
Okay.

40:39.696 --> 40:43.732
But I'm single
and on the wrong side of 35.

40:43.767 --> 40:46.568
I'd have to do injections
and deal with epic mood swings

40:46.603 --> 40:48.537
if I even wanna give myself a chance.

40:51.408 --> 40:53.442
I don't know why I'd
wanna bring a child...

40:53.476 --> 40:56.745
a brown child... into this world.

40:58.583 --> 41:00.382
There are a thousand reasons not to.

41:02.919 --> 41:05.821
But the only way to beat death...

41:07.269 --> 41:08.824
is life.

41:12.328 --> 41:13.562
There's a word for it.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.300
Surrogacy.

41:22.839 --> 41:24.239
Hope.
