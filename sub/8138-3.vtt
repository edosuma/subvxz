00:00.934 --> 00:02.265
If you want to get Knight...

00:02.335 --> 00:04.963
you have to deal with that
car of his at the same time.

00:05.038 --> 00:06.938
Okay, pal,
super pursuit mode.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.741
Julian, he took the bait.

00:14.881 --> 00:16.075
Michael, help.

00:16.149 --> 00:19.277
Okay, I'm on my way. You
better turbo-boost out of there.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.353
Michael, I'm in trouble.

00:21.621 --> 00:24.021
Now they got KITT.
I'm the one they want here!

00:24.090 --> 00:26.854
Open up, Knight,
or I kill the girl.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.688
No, Michael,
don't do it!

00:43.777 --> 00:45.039
Knight Rider...

00:45.111 --> 00:48.979
a shadowy flight into the
dangerous world of a man...

00:49.049 --> 00:50.914
who does not exist.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.422
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:01.494 --> 01:04.054
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:04.129 --> 01:06.121
the helpless, the powerless...

01:06.199 --> 01:09.362
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:21.241 --> 02:24.369
Sorry for the delay,
Commissioner, but it's procedure.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.658
Come on! Come on,
let me in!

02:39.726 --> 02:40.750
Go!

02:47.867 --> 02:51.268
The air temperature
is 93.367 degrees.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.737
Water, 71.893 degrees...

02:53.806 --> 02:57.503
and the winds are from
the southwest at 6.789 knots.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.272
He doesn't miss a thing.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.040
Listen, are his scanners programmed
for continuous surveillance, or...

03:02.115 --> 03:03.639
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

03:03.716 --> 03:07.277
I thought we agreed to put
shop talk on hold for today.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.551
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

03:10.623 --> 03:11.715
Yes, I do.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.919
It's a prerequisite for
a doctorate in criminology.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.926
Right, KITT?

03:15.995 --> 03:17.929
I refuse to answer
on the grounds...

03:17.997 --> 03:20.158
it constitutes
an invasion of privacy.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.928
Loosen up, will you, pal?

03:22.235 --> 03:24.169
Devon gave Karen
full approval to study...

03:24.237 --> 03:27.502
all your capabilities and all
your equipment for her thesis.

03:28.408 --> 03:30.273
But not today.

03:37.483 --> 03:38.973
Okay, let's see...

03:39.152 --> 03:41.416
we got a little wine
back here...

03:41.487 --> 03:44.012
and some chips,
a couple sandwiches.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.321
I'm sorry to intrude,
Michael...

03:46.392 --> 03:48.292
but this is extremely urgent.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.557
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

03:52.632 --> 03:55.157
Less than an hour ago, while the
Commissioner was conducting...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.169
an inspection of
the state penitentiary...

03:57.237 --> 03:59.171
two inmates abducted
his chauffeur...

03:59.239 --> 04:02.538
shot a couple of the guards, and then
escaped in the Commissioner's car.

04:02.609 --> 04:05.703
I understand your concern, but what's
this go to do with the Foundation?

04:05.778 --> 04:07.803
One of the felons
is Jeffrey Cavanaugh.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.542
Oh, yeah.
I remember Cavanaugh.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.042
Cavanaugh was
a syndicate hoodlum.

04:13.119 --> 04:15.144
I had the pleasure of
putting him away last year.

04:15.221 --> 04:18.053
When last sighted, Cavanaugh
and his cellmate, Lukas...

04:18.124 --> 04:19.853
were headed
in your direction.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.017
Good luck, Michael.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.654
Oh, and cave canem.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.225
Cave canem?

04:25.298 --> 04:26.663
What happened
to "be careful"?

04:26.733 --> 04:28.928
Well, that's
what he said in Latin.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.562
Literally translated,
it means "beware of the dog."

04:31.638 --> 04:34.402
All right.
Let's button up, pal.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.404
Well...

04:40.780 --> 04:42.304
there goes the beach.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.584
All right, the first order of business
is to access the police band...

04:53.660 --> 04:55.924
and get an updated position
on the getaway car.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.327
Michael, this country is a
maze of streets and freeways...

04:58.398 --> 05:00.332
with millions of
vehicles in transit.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.891
Are you saying that KITT can... Watch.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.360
The vehicle was
last spotted here.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.838
Then turned east
onto this secondary road...

05:07.907 --> 05:09.807
towards Soledad Canyon.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.310
All right, plot every escape
route Cavanaugh has available...

05:12.378 --> 05:14.141
then give me the most
probable point of intercept.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.976
I'm on to him, Michael.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.349
Incredible. Out of all those cars, he
can tell which one Cavanaugh's driving?

05:20.420 --> 05:23.821
Nope, but he can tell there's
only one going 95 miles an hour.

05:31.297 --> 05:32.286
Come on, Cavanaugh.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.391
How much longer before we make this
connection you keep talking about?

05:35.468 --> 05:36.526
Just cool it, Lukas!

05:36.602 --> 05:38.968
I got you out of there,
didn't I? Now just back off!

05:55.521 --> 05:59.321
All right, this is Cavanaugh. Estimated
time of arrival is 45 seconds. Are you there?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.587
Ready to rendezvous.
Come on in.

06:02.762 --> 06:03.956
Oh, no!

06:04.030 --> 06:05.224
What is it?
What's going on?

06:05.298 --> 06:07.129
It's that car, man,
that car that's tailing us.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.565
I know that car.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.786
Shall I micro-lock
his brakes, Michael?

06:33.860 --> 06:36.260
No, he might crash
into those tanks.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.133
What is this, man? Where are we
going? What are we doing in here?

06:48.207 --> 06:50.038
This is the end of the line.

07:03.289 --> 07:05.086
Michael, hurry up,
he's reloading.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.147
Stay put.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.689
Michael,
Cavanaugh's getting away.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.984
Any chance of
micro-locking that chopper?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.117
Negative, Michael.

07:41.194 --> 07:44.425
He's behind those tanks and
out of my line of transmission.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.576
$300,000,
a new identity...

08:05.017 --> 08:07.542
a passport,
a ticket to Paraguay.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.454
That was the deal.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.984
That was for three months
in the joint.

08:14.894 --> 08:18.557
You let me rot in that hellhole
for over a year, Julian.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.457
That's gonna cost you.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.801
Come on, Jeff.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.832
What do you
want me to say?

08:25.004 --> 08:27.802
I had a judge in my pocket,
and I lost him to a coronary.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.341
It was an act of God.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.433
There was nothing I could do. Bull!

08:31.511 --> 08:34.308
Now, I knew Julian Martin
when he was Julio Martinez...

08:34.380 --> 08:36.905
and didn't even have
a green card, remember?

08:37.316 --> 08:41.376
You hit a grocery store for a couple of
six-packs and thought you'd scored big.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.547
Come on, don't try
to snow me now.

08:43.956 --> 08:47.483
Now, you sat on your hands until
I threatened to go to the DA.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.391
Now, I could've copped
a plea and walked...

08:50.463 --> 08:51.930
and I still can.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.464
A flat million,
that's the deal.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.176
You ungrateful
little punk.

09:06.112 --> 09:09.809
If it wasn't for me, you'd still
be hustling in the old neighborhood.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.206
You know...

09:11.284 --> 09:13.844
you're pushing real hard
for a guy who screwed up.

09:13.920 --> 09:14.978
What're you talking about?

09:15.054 --> 09:17.579
I'm talking about
your friend Knight.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.691
It took me two years
to get him off my back.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.420
You're out of
the joint one hour...

09:22.495 --> 09:24.053
and you bring him
down on me again.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.860
That's your problem, Julian.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.262
Now I'll consider this
a down payment.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.032
Get the rest of it to me
by the end of the day.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.366
Snyder.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.878
Banks are already closed
for the weekend, genius.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.980
Besides, nobody...

09:49.722 --> 09:52.316
and I mean nobody,
takes my money...

09:52.525 --> 09:54.425
and leaves me
holding the bag.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.756
Oh, I'll take care of Knight.

09:57.563 --> 10:01.624
But you, my friend, you're not
going anywhere until he's dead.

10:01.767 --> 10:06.204
One call and my friend sends
a package to the DA, Julio.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.068
And I can drop a dime
on you like that.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.170
And blow a cool million? Nah.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.483
You're stupid, Jeff...

10:19.318 --> 10:21.047
but not that stupid.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.747
Now don't leave here...

10:23.823 --> 10:27.122
because if you get busted,
we both go down.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.882
Devon, that chopper
scooped Cavanaugh...

10:50.950 --> 10:52.474
right out of my hands.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.314
Now I'm telling you
this is a lot more...

10:54.387 --> 10:56.446
than a couple of cons
making a run for the fence.

10:56.522 --> 10:57.648
I agree, Michael.

10:57.723 --> 11:01.181
Cavanaugh must have made some powerful
connections while he was in prison.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.387
I think he had them
before he went in.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.225
Let's check his records.

11:16.442 --> 11:17.636
Go away, please.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.075
And be quiet.

11:22.548 --> 11:24.948
I have no intention
of giving your fleas...

11:25.017 --> 11:27.349
sanctuary in my upholstery.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.558
But under
the circumstances...

11:41.233 --> 11:43.326
I know, I know.
I'm working on it.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.243
All clear, pooch.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.247
But please don't
make this a habit.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.881
My auto-vac system isn't
programmed for paw prints.

12:07.126 --> 12:08.252
Here it is, Julian Martin.

12:08.327 --> 12:10.318
Two years ago, he and Cavanaugh
were knotted together...

12:10.396 --> 12:12.193
tighter than
a family of snakes.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.755
And ever since then, Martin
has posed as a model citizen...

12:14.834 --> 12:16.631
and respected
businessman...

12:16.902 --> 12:19.962
making absolutely sure
that nothing soils his hands.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.909
Now why would he risk helping
a lowlife like Cavanaugh...

12:23.976 --> 12:25.671
to break out of prison?

12:26.812 --> 12:28.939
Maybe he had no choice.

12:35.354 --> 12:38.414
Devon, the guy Cavanaugh killed
was an accountant, remember?

12:38.491 --> 12:41.255
He'd blown the whistle on
several of Martin's operations.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.955
He claimed that
they were syndicate laundries.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.558
We never came up
with the records...

12:46.632 --> 12:48.566
that tied Martin
to the victim.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.659
You may have a point.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.930
According to this, the prosecutor's
office had to abandon the case...

12:54.006 --> 12:55.997
against Martin for lack
of sufficient evidence.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.406
Could be something
to do with that.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.876
Yes, but that's merely
a theory, Michael.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.345
What we need is enough
evidence to convince the jury.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.144
Don't you see? Martin's just
given us a way to get it.

13:05.217 --> 13:08.015
We nail Cavanaugh, we nail
Martin, and vice versa.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.482
Hey, Michael.

13:10.556 --> 13:14.253
Now, you can't take on this Martin dude
without some heavy-duty backup, my man.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.590
I think he's got all
the backup he can handle, RC.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.290
Remember, Michael, you said I
could go as long as I stay in KITT.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.128
That's right.
RC, I'm saving you...

13:21.200 --> 13:22.724
for the double
heavy-duty action.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.860
You dig?

13:23.936 --> 13:27.633
RC, would you refrain from polluting
this office with your canned litter?

13:27.706 --> 13:28.798
You dig?

13:29.608 --> 13:30.632
You got it, skipper.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.218
Next, Ginger models
a Grimaldi original...

13:40.286 --> 13:42.550
in blue-black
floral lycratex.

13:42.621 --> 13:45.749
Perfect for quick dips,
quick tans, and quick changes.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.589
Marilee wears
a coral and azure v-front...

13:52.665 --> 13:55.657
She's the one I was telling
you about, Councilman.

13:55.734 --> 13:56.894
Pretty, huh?

13:57.236 --> 13:59.329
This stunning
hot pink terrycloth...

13:59.405 --> 14:00.633
By the way...

14:00.806 --> 14:05.038
I keep hearing more and more talk
about offshore drilling areas.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.446
I mean, if those tidelands just
happen to be rezoned for commercial...

14:08.514 --> 14:09.811
Julian, you...

14:10.749 --> 14:13.377
know my commission
can't be compromised...

14:13.953 --> 14:15.887
in this matter.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.484
Of course not, Councilman.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.295
But, as you
very well know...

14:25.264 --> 14:28.131
everyone profits
from a healthy economy.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.224
Everyone.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.002
What's he doing here?

14:32.071 --> 14:33.902
I got people looking
all over for him.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.203
Well, it looks like
he saved you the trouble.

14:36.275 --> 14:38.709
Find out how
he got past the guards.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.811
Afternoon, gentlemen.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.979
I don't know how you got
in here, Knight...

14:48.053 --> 14:49.281
but it's time to leave.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.051
Soon as you tell me
where I can find Cavanaugh.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.416
Cavanaugh?

14:54.159 --> 14:57.060
Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
Maybe this rings a bell.

14:57.129 --> 14:58.756
You just broke him
out of prison.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.264
And I know why.

15:00.332 --> 15:01.856
Jeffrey Cavanaugh?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.464
Don't tell me.
I'd prefer not to know.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.061
Councilman. Excuse me.
Councilman!

15:07.139 --> 15:08.401
I'll clean this up
in a minute.

15:08.474 --> 15:11.443
That's right, that's right,
laundry's one of your specialties.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.410
You got away squeaky clean
two years ago.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.538
But this time I'm going to
be right on top of you...

15:15.614 --> 15:17.946
until I see your neck
in a wringer.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.072
Ciao.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.286
His name was
on the roster.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.752
Cancel his membership.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.388
That's no ordinary hit,
Julian.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.064
If you want to get Knight...

15:36.502 --> 15:39.528
you have to deal with that
car of his at the same time.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.497
He's got to have a weak spot.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.540
Now, you find it.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.808
Get me Devon,
will you, pal?

15:48.881 --> 15:50.610
Right away, Michael.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.048
Something to report,
Michael?

15:52.117 --> 15:55.280
Yeah. I jerked Martin's cord,
and he came right at me.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.815
Sounds as if he has
something to hide.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.723
His name is Cavanaugh.
The question is, where?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.284
Look, I need locations
on all of Martin's operations.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.193
I'll get Bonnie working
on it right away.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.526
Thank you.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.232
Look, Karen, I'm sorry
about all this.

16:11.303 --> 16:14.864
Are you kidding? I've got
enough material for two PhDs.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.704
I do think I've had
enough today, though.

16:17.776 --> 16:18.868
Me, too.

16:18.944 --> 16:20.571
I think I'll drop you off
at your home.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.513
Nothing much is gonna happen
until we get that data from Devon.

16:23.582 --> 16:24.708
Good.

16:24.783 --> 16:29.015
By the way, I make the best pasta
primavera this side of the Spanish Steps.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.715
What do you say?

16:31.256 --> 16:35.056
I'd say I'd take your pasta
over the Spanish Steps any day.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.230
So...

16:51.810 --> 16:54.176
did you find a way
to get to Knight?

16:55.814 --> 16:56.940
Two of them.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.212
He works with one...

17:06.724 --> 17:08.249
plays with the other.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.627
Good.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.352
You again?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.892
And him again.
Doesn't he ever give up?

17:49.435 --> 17:51.062
Come on, get in.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.180
Kindly keep your paws
to yourself, mister.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.720
I believe the ones
you're after...

18:09.788 --> 18:12.780
are scurrying between those
houses across the street.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.528
Good morning, Michael.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.655
Michael...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.332
Are you all right?

18:22.734 --> 18:24.759
You're looking a little
scruffy this morning...

18:24.837 --> 18:26.771
if you don't mind
my saying so.

18:34.346 --> 18:35.677
What is it?

18:35.747 --> 18:38.238
Devon just called.
I gave him Karen's number.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.306
He should be...

18:42.521 --> 18:44.352
Stay right there.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.947
I'll be right back.

18:51.563 --> 18:52.860
Hello, Devon.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.159
Michael, there you are.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.292
I had some trouble
getting through to you.

18:56.368 --> 18:59.132
Julian Martin just called. He
wants to see you right away.

18:59.204 --> 19:02.298
I'm afraid I'm still working on
that information you requested.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.001
I don't think
we're gonna need it.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.068
Sounds to me like Martin's
going to cop out on Cavanaugh.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.875
I'll get on it right away.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.708
Look, I gotta
check this out...

19:11.783 --> 19:14.343
and I'll be back
for breakfast.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.752
Okay, bye.
Bye.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.865
Did I just see
what I think I saw?

19:33.939 --> 19:35.566
What do you think
you saw, Michael?

19:35.641 --> 19:36.801
I saw...

19:36.875 --> 19:38.035
Forget it.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.011
I think I should have finished
that cup of espresso.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.969
Thank you.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.513
Mr. Knight.
Sit down, please.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.884
Why don't you order something to
eat? The food here is excellent.

20:29.394 --> 20:33.626
You know, I like to see a new member
get everything he's got coming to him.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.700
Look, this powwow was
your idea.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.236
Why don't you just
get to the point?

20:39.304 --> 20:41.067
I don't have time
to play any games.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.869
You had plenty of time yesterday
when you embarrassed me...

20:43.942 --> 20:45.807
in front of the councilman.

20:45.877 --> 20:47.367
Now it's my turn.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.582
Seen the papers?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.645
You know, every once in a while
I come across a nasty story...

20:55.721 --> 20:56.949
about someone I know.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.752
Yeah, well, I'm working
on a headline of my own.

21:00.392 --> 21:03.020
"Julian Martin indicted."

21:03.795 --> 21:05.695
Well,
check tonight's edition.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.989
You'll find one
that says...

21:08.066 --> 21:10.398
"Graduate student abducted."

21:11.303 --> 21:13.737
And I think
her name was Karen.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.632
Karen something.
Sit down!

21:17.743 --> 21:19.005
Relax.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.778
You can't shoot me here,
and you know it.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.576
Oh, yes, I can
if you attack me.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.846
I'll do a hell of a lot more
than that if you hurt Karen.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.148
If you think kidnapping her
is gonna make me back off...

21:29.221 --> 21:30.688
you're wrong, man.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.224
It's just gonna make me
come on a lot stronger.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.123
Well, don't worry, man.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.326
It's only a rumor.

21:37.396 --> 21:38.693
Maybe I made a mistake.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.392
That's two mistakes,
counting Cavanaugh.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.333
And I'm gonna use them both
to nail you to the wall.

22:04.790 --> 22:08.419
Well, it looks like she put up a
fight, pal, but came out second best.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.653
Scan everything in sight.

22:09.728 --> 22:11.855
I'm too far away
to get any detail, Michael.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.558
All right, work through
my com-link, will you?

22:18.937 --> 22:20.427
Hold it, Michael.
Right there.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.564
I just picked up
a handprint on that wall.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.370
All right, run a comparison.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.809
Start with Martin,
Snyder and Cavanaugh.

22:26.978 --> 22:30.004
I want as much hard evidence
as I can get.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.572
What's this?
It's still wet.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.346
It appears to be
a manufactured substance.

22:35.487 --> 22:36.886
All right.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.385
Let's do
a chemical analysis, huh?

22:39.491 --> 22:42.483
Maybe we can get a fix on
where they've taken Karen.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.834
I'm really sorry
about this.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.472
But, you know, you can thank your
boyfriend for the inconvenience.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.379
Well, I'll be sure
to mention your name.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.577
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?

23:09.020 --> 23:10.885
Where's Cavanaugh?

23:10.956 --> 23:13.481
The word is
he made a call and split.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.287
He could be anywhere.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.622
Damn!

23:17.662 --> 23:18.754
Come here.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.665
You know,
Jeffrey and I go way back.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.401
And whenever we were
up against it...

23:24.469 --> 23:26.835
the first thing we'd do
was we'd make sure...

23:26.905 --> 23:29.305
our insurance was
still in force.

23:29.641 --> 23:32.474
Now I'll bet you
anything...

23:32.644 --> 23:35.306
that right now
he's with that friend...

23:36.314 --> 23:39.442
who's got the evidence
that's keeping him alive.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.315
What do you
want to do, Julian?

23:41.386 --> 23:43.581
Call that lady
at the phone company...

23:43.655 --> 23:45.213
have her trace the call.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.951
Get me an address, okay?

23:47.826 --> 23:48.986
Good.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.546
Giving it to Julian
in exchange for the million?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.013
What are you, nuts?

24:11.082 --> 24:14.347
He'd blow me away in a second
if he got his hands on this.

24:14.419 --> 24:15.909
Oh, I'm...

24:15.987 --> 24:17.852
Jodie, I'm sorry.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.891
Look, I'm just so wired.

24:21.827 --> 24:23.419
I got to go.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.060
I love you, I love you.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.655
I love you, too.

24:27.732 --> 24:29.222
I love you.

24:35.907 --> 24:37.397
Karen kidnapped?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.841
That's very distressing.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.572
I can't help feeling I should
have foreseen the possibility.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.580
Have you reported it
to the authorities yet?

24:43.648 --> 24:44.706
No.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.717
No, I think
we should hold off.

24:46.818 --> 24:50.276
I don't want to make it easier for
Martin to kill her than to keep her.

24:50.355 --> 24:52.346
Do you have any ideas
as to her whereabouts?

24:52.424 --> 24:54.392
KITT and I came up
with a couple of things.

24:54.459 --> 24:55.551
Anything yet, pal?

24:55.627 --> 24:56.685
Yes, Michael.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.594
The handprint belongs to
Snyder, Martin's bodyguard.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.861
I've also determined the substance
is a varnish of some kind.

25:02.934 --> 25:05.402
I'm still breaking down
its chemical composition.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.596
All right, keep at it.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.901
Oh, and have him
clear a channel, Michael.

25:08.974 --> 25:12.307
I'm ready to transmit that
data on Martin's operations.

25:12.377 --> 25:13.401
Perhaps it'll help.

25:13.478 --> 25:15.571
Let's hope so, Devon.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.615
I'm the one
who got Karen into this.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.673
I wanna make sure
I get her out.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.618
This ought to do it.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.389
What about the address your
friend is running down for us?

25:29.461 --> 25:30.689
She was off duty
when I called.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.196
Took a while to track her
down. She's working on it now.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.392
I thought I told you
not to leave.

25:35.467 --> 25:38.334
Worried about me getting hit
by a bus or something?

25:39.271 --> 25:42.707
If you're thinking of arranging
a little accident or something...

25:42.774 --> 25:44.002
forget it, Julian.

25:44.075 --> 25:46.873
I mean, anything that happens to
me, the DA's gonna get that ledger.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.243
Oh, yeah,
I'd like to have my money.

25:49.314 --> 25:53.341
Well, Knight's about
to become history.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.010
Why don't you
stick around and watch?

25:55.086 --> 25:56.781
Then you get
your money. Mmm?

26:09.634 --> 26:11.101
Here's the speech.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.696
You make it
like you mean it.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.175
Clear?

26:21.246 --> 26:22.804
Sorry it took so long,
Michael.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.816
I've finally identified the
chemical composition of that varnish.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.819
It's a polycarbonic compound with a
densely packed molecular structure...

26:28.887 --> 26:30.013
very similar...

26:30.088 --> 26:32.113
Come on, pal, will you give me
the bottom line?

26:32.190 --> 26:34.488
It's a special custom-made
marine varnish.

26:34.559 --> 26:38.051
All right. We just narrowed
the search to the marina area.

26:38.129 --> 26:39.494
Michael...

26:39.764 --> 26:41.425
Karen's calling.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.961
I'll make it
a three-way patch.

26:44.035 --> 26:45.059
Michael? Michael...

26:45.136 --> 26:47.195
Martin's people came after me.
But I escaped.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.705
Where are you?
Are you okay?

26:48.773 --> 26:50.741
Just listen.
I don't have much time.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.437
They came after me. I'm stuck
in this shipping place...

26:53.511 --> 26:55.445
Ludlow and the waterfront.
Hurry.

26:55.513 --> 26:56.707
I'm on my way!

26:56.781 --> 26:59.079
Michael? Cave canem.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.349
Okay, pal,
super pursuit mode.

27:16.668 --> 27:19.136
Julian, he took the bait.

27:19.738 --> 27:20.864
Good.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.204
Reel him in and gut him.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.317
All right,
we're getting close.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.876
Let's close it down.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.565
There doesn't seem to be
anyone around, Michael.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.870
Why are we
stopping out here?

27:58.943 --> 28:00.570
You heard what Karen said.

28:00.645 --> 28:01.771
Cave canem.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.672
She was warning us
it's a trap, pal.

28:04.749 --> 28:06.614
Scan the place.
See if you can locate her.

28:08.119 --> 28:10.610
It's no use, Michael. I'm
getting too much interference.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.623
There's a concentration
of lead in the area.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.556
All right, you go in
and keep them busy.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.719
I wanna do a little
investigating on my own.

28:16.795 --> 28:18.888
But if it's a trap,
you'll be a lot safer in me.

28:18.963 --> 28:20.658
Safe and predictable.

28:20.732 --> 28:22.529
I'm the one they want.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.699
While they're
coming at you...

28:24.769 --> 28:26.862
I want to be
searching for Karen.

28:29.607 --> 28:30.904
Tinted windows.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.882
Okay, pal, go for it.

29:09.914 --> 29:10.938
Any sign of him yet?

29:11.015 --> 29:12.107
Negative, Michael.

29:12.183 --> 29:15.084
I'm beginning to think
Martin's playing games with us.

29:15.153 --> 29:17.678
Michael, there's a giant
forklift coming straight at me.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.189
All right,
keep them busy, pal.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.090
I need all the time I can get
to search for Karen.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.157
Make that two more
giant forklifts!

29:32.971 --> 29:34.165
I'm in trouble, Michael!

29:34.239 --> 29:36.503
They're going to scoop me off
the ground with their forks!

29:36.574 --> 29:39.702
Okay, I'm on my way. You
better turbo-boost out of there.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.045
I've fallen into a trap
of some kind, Michael!

29:46.117 --> 29:47.379
They've got me!

29:50.088 --> 29:51.077
KITT?

29:51.156 --> 29:52.623
I'm in a large steel box.

29:52.690 --> 29:55.818
I'm gonna try to turbo boost
my way out of here, Michael.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.052
Where are you, buddy?

30:01.065 --> 30:05.126
It's no use. I can't get a running start
to generate power to penetrate steel.

30:05.203 --> 30:06.227
Do you have any suggestions?

30:06.304 --> 30:08.169
KITT, talk to me!

30:08.239 --> 30:10.764
Michael? Michael,
why aren't you responding?

30:11.743 --> 30:14.007
KITT, I can't hear you.
Where are you?

30:18.817 --> 30:19.806
KITT?

30:25.924 --> 30:27.824
Talk to me, buddy.
Talk to me!

30:32.263 --> 30:33.423
KITT?

30:33.631 --> 30:34.825
KITT!

30:49.714 --> 30:52.740
I've scanned the area and reconstructed
the movement of the vehicles.

30:54.085 --> 30:56.280
These tread marks were made
by the forklifts.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.481
And these are
definitely KITT's.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.255
Looks like they trapped him in
some sort of pincer movement.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.194
Well, whatever they did,
it worked.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.663
They gave him
one escape route...

31:07.732 --> 31:09.893
he took it,
ended up in that hole.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.663
Clever dudes, man.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.226
But where'd he go?

31:13.304 --> 31:16.671
Judging from those other tracks,
into one of the containers...

31:16.741 --> 31:18.106
and trucked away.

31:36.327 --> 31:38.591
I will handle
this one myself.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.290
Give me the Uzi.

31:44.435 --> 31:46.528
I don't understand
what's going wrong, Michael.

31:46.604 --> 31:48.902
Lead. The containers have
got to be lined with lead.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.942
KITT's always had a problem
scanning because of that.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.008
Well, they got Karen,
and now they got KITT.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.778
I'm the one
they want here!

32:00.852 --> 32:03.548
Maybe I should just go to Martin
and offer myself in exchange.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.849
Hey, whoa!

32:05.123 --> 32:07.318
Hey, I'm into chivalry
myself, man.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.384
But Martin's the kind of guy that'd
say to you, "Yeah, come ahead."

32:10.461 --> 32:12.452
And then he'd
blow y'all away.

32:14.999 --> 32:17.058
Come on, come on.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.740
It's KITT! He's alive!

32:23.808 --> 32:25.332
He's transmitting a signal.

32:27.578 --> 32:29.773
Somewhere northwest of here.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.518
His signal's too weak
to compute exactly where.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.849
That's all we've got.
No, it isn't.

32:41.926 --> 32:44.394
Look, we narrowed the search
for Karen to the marina area.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.987
Chances are they're
keeping KITT there, too.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.454
You're right.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.161
The data I transmitted earlier
listed numerous Martin operations...

32:51.235 --> 32:52.327
on the waterfront.

32:52.403 --> 32:53.768
I'm out of here.

32:57.675 --> 32:58.937
Uh...

32:59.010 --> 33:01.478
What are you gonna use
for transportation?

33:02.246 --> 33:04.612
What am I gonna use
for transportation?

33:05.883 --> 33:07.009
Follow me.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.623
Stand on it, RC.
Every second counts.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.318
You got it, my man.

33:22.767 --> 33:24.701
You handle this rig
like a pro.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.438
It's bulletproof.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.139
Rip open the T-top!

33:53.231 --> 33:54.357
Get up.

33:54.899 --> 33:56.230
Get out of there.

34:02.407 --> 34:05.308
Open up, Knight,
or I kill the girl.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.501
No, Michael,
don't do it!

34:09.746 --> 34:11.078
Last call, Knight.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.049
Open up or she dies!

34:13.117 --> 34:16.348
This is the one time I'm glad
you're not with me, Michael.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.029
Knight is not there,
you idiots!

34:26.664 --> 34:28.130
Great move, Julian.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.326
Your clowns kidnapped
an empty car!

34:33.538 --> 34:35.972
This is what it's
all about.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.337
I mean, like I've
been kinda missing...

34:37.408 --> 34:39.137
the Street Avenger action,
you know, man?

34:39.210 --> 34:40.609
Action! You and me.

34:40.678 --> 34:41.871
Hey, wait up, wait up.
Slow down. Slow down.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.675
All right,
we're getting close.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.010
KITT's signal's dead ahead.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.074
Hang a right
at the next corner.

34:47.952 --> 34:50.819
Don't give me this stuff
about banking hours.

34:50.888 --> 34:52.822
You got cash planted
all over this town...

34:52.889 --> 34:54.414
and I want mine now!

34:59.697 --> 35:02.291
I said when Knight's dead...

35:03.501 --> 35:04.627
and I meant it.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.397
And so did I
about my little friend...

35:06.471 --> 35:08.098
giving the records
to the DA.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.732
Now, you've got till
noon today. That's it.

35:15.746 --> 35:17.077
I can't believe it.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.811
This little punk has got me
between a rock and a hard place.

35:21.819 --> 35:25.346
That's what I get for pulling
his butt out of jail.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.623
I tell you...

35:27.959 --> 35:32.020
there's nothing that I want more
than to pull his plug right now.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.090
Start pulling.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.224
No more rock,
no more hard place.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.095
His little friend's name
is Jodie Hopkins.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.761
I've got the address
right here.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.542
Jodie Hopkins.

35:48.846 --> 35:51.280
Cavanaugh, come here.

35:54.285 --> 35:56.981
Actually, I got
good news for you.

35:57.688 --> 36:00.589
This little
friend of yours...

36:01.359 --> 36:03.793
it's somebody
we grew up with, isn't it?

36:03.861 --> 36:06.728
Maybe. What's it to you?
What's this all about?

36:07.198 --> 36:08.256
Blackmail.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.869
I really can't blame you
for keeping her to yourself.

36:12.403 --> 36:16.772
I mean, Jodie Hopkins was always
a very special woman, wasn't she?

36:18.709 --> 36:21.837
Any message you want me to
pass on to her when I see her?

36:23.548 --> 36:26.142
See? I told you
I had good news.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.379
And bad news.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.498
We got one more piece
of business with Jodie.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.400
Hold it, RC. Pull in here.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.971
Wait a minute.

36:53.945 --> 36:57.005
That building right there,
that's got to be the one.

36:57.081 --> 37:00.380
All right. Let's rev this baby up
and blow right through those doors.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.544
Let's not and say we did.
You sit right here...

37:02.620 --> 37:05.145
and you keep your hands
folded. You got that?

37:08.159 --> 37:09.922
KITT, can you read me?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.756
Like you were next to me,
Michael.

37:11.829 --> 37:14.423
I am, pal. Right outside.

37:14.498 --> 37:16.966
Oh, I was hoping
you were going to say that.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.332
How are things going
in there? Is Karen okay?

37:19.403 --> 37:21.166
I think so,
but I can't be certain.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.707
I'm still inside this
claustrophobic container...

37:23.774 --> 37:25.708
and can't send
lateral transmissions.

37:25.776 --> 37:27.641
Don't worry.
Not too much longer.

37:27.712 --> 37:29.407
How many of Martin's men
are in there?

37:29.480 --> 37:31.004
Three, from the sound
of their voices.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.710
All right, it's gonna take me a
couple of minutes to get into position.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.183
You hang in there.

37:35.453 --> 37:36.545
I'm gonna need your help.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.145
All right. I wanna go in
there with you, Michael.

37:38.222 --> 37:40.486
On the outside. You get
yourself to a pay phone...

37:40.558 --> 37:43.254
you call Devon and you
request some police backup.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.591
Then I'm gonna need you
to back me up. You dig?

37:45.663 --> 37:46.789
I can dig it, my man.

37:46.864 --> 37:50.129
I told you I was saving you
for the heavy-duty action stuff.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.611
All right, KITT.
I'm inside.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.973
We're gonna
raid the place.

39:10.047 --> 39:11.275
You get my meaning?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.544
I'm reading you
loud and clear.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.590
All right.
Let's do it.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.958
This is the police.
You're surrounded.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.727
Throw out your guns and come
out with your hands up!

39:35.940 --> 39:37.305
There's nothing.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.644
Get the girl,
I'll get the car!

39:52.590 --> 39:53.852
Get him, KITT!

40:06.570 --> 40:09.061
The man said, "stay,"
and you're staying.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.836
Good work, pal. All right, give
me some help with these cuffs.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.434
No problem, Michael.
They're standard issue.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.504
You, okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.706
Martin's gone.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.579
You know where?
I'll tell you on the way.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.675
All right, hop in.
Head downtown.

40:22.887 --> 40:24.821
All right, KITT.
Open the door.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.985
All right, pal.
We don't have much time.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.859
Super pursuit mode.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.304
That's the house.

40:46.510 --> 40:48.444
Okay, I'm gonna park
around the back.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.309
I don't wanna be announced.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.546
All right, you said you'd tell
me about Martin on the way.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.488
I'd say it's time
to start talking.

41:01.559 --> 41:03.083
Martin's got
the evidence, Michael.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.094
I figured that all along.

41:05.162 --> 41:06.857
All right, look,
we've got to beat him to it.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.489
Do you have any idea
where he's headed?

41:08.566 --> 41:10.830
All I know is I heard them say
something about Jodie Hopkins.

41:10.901 --> 41:11.890
That's all I've got.

41:11.969 --> 41:12.993
Maybe that's all we need.

41:13.070 --> 41:15.368
KITT, give me everything
you got on one Jodie Hopkins.

41:15.439 --> 41:17.168
Right away, Michael.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.406
I found Jodie Hopkins,
Michael...

41:21.479 --> 41:22.741
but there are three listings.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.747
Bel Air, Beverly Hills
and South Gate.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.009
Good work.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.311
Question is, which one?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.113
I don't know
if this will help, Michael...

41:29.186 --> 41:32.314
but I overheard something about Jodie
and Cavanaugh growing up together.

41:32.389 --> 41:36.519
Cavanaugh doesn't strike me as the kind
of guy who grew up in a chic neighborhood.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.563
Plot me the fastest course
to the South Gate address.

41:50.574 --> 41:51.768
Jeffrey?

41:58.749 --> 42:00.046
Hi, Jodie.

42:00.117 --> 42:01.448
Long time no see.

42:02.119 --> 42:04.644
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

42:04.722 --> 42:07.247
Your blackmailing
boyfriend is dead.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.416
Dead? No.

42:08.492 --> 42:09.618
Oh, yeah.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.358
You're next...

42:12.263 --> 42:14.356
if you don't hand over
those records he gave you.

42:14.431 --> 42:16.126
I don't have them.

42:17.401 --> 42:18.800
Even if I knew
where they were...

42:18.869 --> 42:20.769
you'd kill me as soon as
I gave them to you.

42:22.139 --> 42:23.697
I know you would.

42:26.443 --> 42:31.039
Well, there is only one way
to find out, isn't there?

42:47.097 --> 42:50.328
All right, I don't see Martin's
car. Scan the place for me.

42:50.968 --> 42:53.027
I'm picking up
only one person, Michael.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.298
A female who appears nervous,
but uninjured.

42:55.372 --> 42:56.464
All right, you...

42:56.540 --> 42:58.007
I know. Stay put.

43:03.981 --> 43:05.278
Jodie?

43:06.951 --> 43:08.111
Who is it?

43:08.185 --> 43:09.948
My name is
Michael Knight.

43:10.054 --> 43:11.544
I'm looking for Martin.

43:11.622 --> 43:12.987
Open up, please.

43:15.326 --> 43:16.315
Jodie...

43:17.428 --> 43:19.225
tell me you didn't
give him the evidence.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.321
I didn't.
I didn't have it...

43:21.398 --> 43:22.865
but I told him
where it was.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.059
Are you the police?

43:24.134 --> 43:26.261
No, no. Look,
there's no time to explain.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.237
Where's Martin?
Where'd he go?

43:30.474 --> 43:34.740
All right, the evidence is in a brown
'78 Chevy in a downtown parking structure.

43:42.553 --> 43:45.113
The parking structure
is dead ahead, Michael.

44:08.779 --> 44:11.145
All right, let's go back
to cruise mode.

44:14.251 --> 44:16.719
Michael, there are
two parking structures.

44:19.757 --> 44:22.783
All right, KITT, scan the
area for the Chevy, will you?

44:24.294 --> 44:26.125
I've picked up
a brown '78 sedan...

44:26.196 --> 44:27.857
on top of the west structure,
Michael.

44:27.931 --> 44:29.057
Let's do it.

44:44.715 --> 44:46.512
KITT, that's a brown Chevy,
all right...

44:46.583 --> 44:49.313
but that sure isn't Snyder
and Martin. What's going on?

44:49.386 --> 44:52.253
My scanner just picked up an identical
vehicle on the opposite tower.

44:52.322 --> 44:54.153
All right, give me
a close-up real fast.

44:54.224 --> 44:55.714
Right away, Michael.

45:00.464 --> 45:01.522
They've got it, Michael.

45:01.598 --> 45:04.499
All right, it's too late
to cut them off down below.

45:04.568 --> 45:05.728
You think we can make it?

45:05.803 --> 45:07.828
It's 20 feet more
than my previous record.

45:07.905 --> 45:10.203
You're not doing
what I think you're doing?

45:10.274 --> 45:12.674
Records are made
to be broken.

45:12.810 --> 45:14.072
Let's do it.

45:24.688 --> 45:25.712
You ready?

45:25.789 --> 45:27.780
You are doing
what I think you're doing.

45:27.858 --> 45:30.019
Give me all
the turbo boost you got!

45:44.675 --> 45:45.937
Get him!

45:54.852 --> 45:56.581
Take Snyder, pal.
Martin's mine.

45:56.653 --> 45:58.018
Hold on, Karen.

46:22.079 --> 46:24.309
I can't wait to see
tonight's headlines.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.950
Devon, I'm telling you,
you should've seen that jump.

46:38.028 --> 46:39.393
KITT was beautiful!

46:39.463 --> 46:40.987
Just like a gazelle.

46:41.064 --> 46:43.396
Michael, I prefer to be
likened to a rocket.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.368
Cars with animal names
are very common.

46:46.703 --> 46:49.365
You're right, KITT.
And you're one of a kind.

46:49.439 --> 46:51.669
Sort of like
a national treasure.

46:51.742 --> 46:54.040
And you've earned
your privacy.

46:54.211 --> 46:56.702
What are you using
as a basis for your thesis?

46:56.780 --> 46:58.042
"Michael Knight.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.440
"Sexiest crime fighter
in America."

47:01.451 --> 47:03.419
I think
the final interview...

47:03.487 --> 47:05.478
should be held
by candlelight...

47:05.556 --> 47:07.080
at a very private party...

47:07.157 --> 47:09.148
on a very private sailboat.

47:09.226 --> 47:10.284
Karen, thank you...

47:10.360 --> 47:12.328
but would you consider
doing me another favor?

47:12.396 --> 47:13.454
Anything.

47:13.530 --> 47:14.963
Would you adopt
a small dog?

47:15.032 --> 47:16.021
Dog?

47:16.099 --> 47:18.226
You might say
he's a friend of mine.

47:18.302 --> 47:20.463
Then I did see
what I thought I saw.

47:20.537 --> 47:23.097
No wonder I've been
feeling itchy lately.

47:23.173 --> 47:25.300
Sorry, Michael,
he needed a place to hide...

47:25.375 --> 47:27.935
and fleas are not
a serious ailment.

47:28.445 --> 47:29.878
Goodbye.
