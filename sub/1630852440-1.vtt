00:34.034 --> 00:36.953
<i>Y'all know for hundreds of years</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:39.289
<i>Black people been asking for reparations.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:43.334
<i>And every time I brought it up,</i>

00:43.418 --> 00:45.211
<i>"That's not realistic."</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:47.839
<i>"Y'all are 13% of the population."</i>

<i>"America can't afford</i>

<i>Everything's on the table.</i>

01:27.420 --> 01:32.050
<i>And they don't like it when we protest.</i>
<i>Groups of us just fucking piss people off.</i>

01:33.134 --> 01:38.014
<i>America treats Black people</i>
<i>the way cashiers treat pennies.</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:43.311
<i>Legally, they have</i>
<i>to accept us everywhere…</i>

<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

01:57.784 --> 01:59.369

01:59.452 --> 02:01.037
<i>And the police shooting…</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:03.289
<i>Every time the cops shoot</i>
<i>an unarmed Black man,</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:05.792
<i>they always be like,</i>
<i>"I was afraid for my life."</i>

<i>"Niggas was fast."</i>

02:09.254 --> 02:10.964
<i>It's the only job you get to do that.</i>

02:11.047 --> 02:14.968
<i>The Supreme Court decided</i>
<i>a policeman is allowed to use deadly force</i>

<i>You can kill a motherfucker</i>
<i>when you afraid,</i>

02:24.853 --> 02:26.855
<i>but I think before we let you be a cop,</i>

02:26.938 --> 02:29.190
<i>we should find out</i>
<i>what you afraid of first.</i>

02:29.274 --> 02:31.651
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

02:31.734 --> 02:32.819
<i>That's reasonable.</i>

02:36.156 --> 02:37.532
<i>I mean that literally.</i>

02:37.615 --> 02:40.910
<i>I think the final exam at Police Academy</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:43.246
<i>should just be a haunted house. Right?</i>

02:43.329 --> 02:44.622
<i>[audience laughing]</i>

02:48.251 --> 02:50.587
<i>But instead of skeletons</i>
<i>and witches and stuff,</i>

02:50.670 --> 02:53.631
<i>it's just Black people</i>
<i>doing everyday activities. You know?</i>

02:56.259 --> 03:00.346
<i>You gotta make it from the front yard</i>
<i>to the cookout in the backyard,</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.765
<i>without killing nobody. You know?</i>

03:03.474 --> 03:05.393
<i>You get your badge at the grill.</i>

03:08.479 --> 03:09.856
<i>Sounds reasonable.</i>

03:11.941 --> 03:15.820
<i>And they always be like,</i>
<i>"Oh, it's just a few bad apples."</i>

03:16.446 --> 03:19.407
<i>How the fuck am I supposed to know</i>
<i>who the bad apples are?</i>

03:19.490 --> 03:22.076
<i>I don't. So what I do is I just avoid it.</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:25.038
<i>If I have an emergency</i>
<i>and I gotta call 911,</i>

03:25.121 --> 03:27.916
<i>I tell them only send firefighters.</i>

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
<i>'Cause I usually don't need the guns.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:34.172
<i>I just need the bravery. See?</i>

03:37.091 --> 03:39.177
<i>Firefighters are just as brave as police.</i>

03:39.260 --> 03:42.805
<i>They will run</i>
<i>into a building that is on fire</i>

03:44.307 --> 03:46.059
<i>with nothing but an axe.</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:52.065
<i>But I've never heard any reports</i>
<i>of a firefighter being startled</i>

03:52.148 --> 03:53.608

<i>I thought you was fire. I, uh…"</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:09.290
<i>"He was flickering.</i>
<i>Y'all seen him flicker."</i>

04:11.584 --> 04:12.877
<i>Since I'm a young Black man,</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:16.464
<i>everybody thinks</i>
<i>that my biggest fear is racist cops.</i>

04:18.466 --> 04:21.344
<i>I'm way more afraid of racist lifeguards.</i>

04:23.638 --> 04:25.139
<i>Nobody thinks about them.</i>

04:26.516 --> 04:29.227
<i>'Cause a racist cop</i>
<i>has to at least break a sweat.</i>

04:30.853 --> 04:33.773
<i>Right? File some false paperwork.</i>
<i>Lie to somebody.</i>

04:35.566 --> 04:38.444
<i>A racist lifeguard</i>
<i>just has to not notice you out there.</i>

04:42.115 --> 04:43.116

04:45.118 --> 04:46.619
<i>So ask yourselves,</i>

04:47.120 --> 04:49.580
<i>is it that Black people can't swim?</i>

04:53.543 --> 04:55.378
<i>Or have we been the victims</i>

04:55.878 --> 04:58.464
<i>of a decades-long conspiracy</i>

04:58.548 --> 05:00.925
<i>by the aquatic wing of the Ku Klux Klan?</i>

05:01.759 --> 05:03.303
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

05:10.184 --> 05:13.438
<i>I have a lot of jokes shitting on cops</i>

05:14.439 --> 05:17.525
<i>and some people take that</i>
<i>to mean that I hate police.</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:18.985
<i>And that's not true.</i>

05:19.068 --> 05:21.654
<i>Right? I mean, first of all,</i>
<i>everybody hates police.</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:24.449
<i>Even police hate police.</i>

05:25.325 --> 05:26.242
<i>Right? And listen…</i>

05:26.326 --> 05:29.454
<i>Look, my comedy is not political.</i>
<i>I don't… I'm not judging you.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:32.248
<i>Right? I don't care</i>
<i>if you're a conservative</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:34.250
<i>or a decent human being. Right? What…</i>

05:35.835 --> 05:37.045
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:40.506
<i>What matters here</i>
<i>is that we're honest. Right?</i>

05:40.590 --> 05:44.052
<i>And the honest-to-God truth is,</i>
<i>regardless of who you voted for,</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:47.847
<i>if you pull out your driveway right now</i>
<i>and you hear that, "Whoop-whoop,"</i>

05:48.389 --> 05:51.059
<i>you're not gonna be like,</i>
<i>"Oh, thank God. A hero."</i>

05:53.144 --> 05:55.021
<i>No. No one reacts that way.</i>

05:55.104 --> 05:56.814
<i>Everyone has the same reaction.</i>

05:56.898 --> 05:58.399
<i>"Fuck him. Fuck!"</i>

06:01.277 --> 06:03.029
<i>There's a reason everybody hates cops.</i>

06:03.112 --> 06:06.157
<i>It's because every interaction</i>
<i>with a cop is negative.</i>

06:06.240 --> 06:08.034
<i>Every time you see a cop,</i>

06:08.117 --> 06:10.036
<i>you know it's gonna cost you money.</i>

06:11.037 --> 06:14.248
<i>So you like, "Fuck him,"</i>
<i>at the very least. Right?</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:19.462
<i>So I think cops</i>
<i>should carry around little prizes.</i>

06:22.131 --> 06:24.175
<i>Every now and then</i>
<i>they just pull you over</i>

06:24.258 --> 06:26.594

<i>out there. You know?</i>

06:27.178 --> 06:29.138
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

06:29.222 --> 06:32.433
<i>Yeah. That way,</i>
<i>you see them sirens and there's hope.</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:35.561
<i>You're like, "You know what?</i>
<i>I've been good this whole time."</i>

06:35.645 --> 06:36.979
<i>"Maybe this is something."</i>

06:38.481 --> 06:40.316
<i>Like, "Do you know why I stopped you?"</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:43.194
<i>"Was it that awesome left turn</i>
<i>I made back there?"</i>

06:43.820 --> 06:45.947
<i>"I think I'm feeling something." You know?</i>

06:46.572 --> 06:48.616
<i>Like, "Yeah, man,</i>
<i>I followed you for ten exits."</i>

06:48.699 --> 06:50.576
<i>"That was three outstanding merges."</i>

06:50.660 --> 06:52.995
<i>"Enjoy your Starbucks</i>
<i>on the city of New York."</i>

06:58.709 --> 07:00.920
<i>Uh, y'all should know this about me.</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:03.798
<i>I am a veteran</i>
<i>of the United States Marine Corps.</i>

07:03.881 --> 07:04.924
<i>-[cheering]</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

07:05.633 --> 07:07.718
<i>No. Please. No. No, no, no.</i>

07:07.802 --> 07:09.887
<i>I'm not a hero. I was just there.</i>

07:09.971 --> 07:11.222
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

07:11.305 --> 07:15.977
<i>I joined for the college money</i>
<i>in March of 2001.</i>

07:16.811 --> 07:19.814
<i>I didn't know we was getting attacked</i>
<i>in September. You know?</i>

07:20.356 --> 07:22.775
<i>Bin Laden fucked up my whole life plan.</i>

07:24.610 --> 07:28.656
<i>I only bring it up because I was</i>
<i>the only Black person in my platoon</i>

07:28.739 --> 07:30.825
<i>for about two years. You know?</i>

07:30.908 --> 07:34.579
<i>I was a lot</i>
<i>of white people's first Black friend.</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:39.208
<i>Yeah. Which, I guess,</i>
<i>does make me a hero of sorts. You know?</i>

07:39.709 --> 07:41.878
<i>-If you think about it.</i>
<i>-[audience applauds]</i>

07:41.961 --> 07:43.838
<i>I trained a lot of you motherfuckers.</i>

07:46.048 --> 07:48.301
<i>It was my first time</i>
<i>being around white people.</i>

07:48.384 --> 07:51.137
<i>I was immersed.</i>
<i>I got my PhD in white folks.</i>

07:51.804 --> 07:55.099
<i>I know how y'all think.</i>
<i>I know what moves your white spirit.</i>

07:57.101 --> 07:59.687
<i>Yeah. I know two things are true</i>

07:59.770 --> 08:02.857
<i>about every white person,</i>
<i>and you can't convince me otherwise.</i>

08:03.357 --> 08:08.446
<i>One is that you can distract</i>
<i>any group of white men with a hacky sack.</i>

08:10.740 --> 08:12.617
<i>I can't explain this phenomenon.</i>

08:13.993 --> 08:16.412
<i>But, ladies,</i>
<i>it's more effective than a rape whistle.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:18.873
<i>Keep one in your purse.</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:22.919
<i>If there's a group of frat boys</i>
<i>following too close,</i>

08:23.002 --> 08:24.921
<i>just toss it over your shoulder.</i>

08:26.172 --> 08:30.384
<i>100% of the time, the dude in the front</i>
<i>will be like, "Whoa! Hey, hey!"</i>

08:31.302 --> 08:32.970
<i>Like, they can't resist.</i>

08:34.263 --> 08:35.640
<i>It's like catnip.</i>

08:38.851 --> 08:42.104
<i>Yeah. And the second thing</i>
<i>I know is true about all white folks</i>

08:42.647 --> 08:45.274
<i>is that all of y'all</i>
<i>wanna say "nigga" a little bit.</i>

08:47.443 --> 08:51.072
<i>Yeah. This is peer-reviewed research.</i>
<i>I don't give a fuck how you feel about it.</i>

08:52.448 --> 08:56.202
<i>Right? 'Cause it's the only thing</i>
<i>in America you can't just freely do.</i>

08:56.911 --> 08:59.830
<i>You gotta think about it.</i>
<i>You gotta make sure the coast is clear.</i>

09:00.331 --> 09:01.207
<i>You know?</i>

09:02.041 --> 09:04.293
<i>You see a group</i>
<i>of Black people in the corner.</i>

09:04.794 --> 09:08.256
<i>They tossing N-words around</i>
<i>like they juggling knives.</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:11.968
<i>You think to yourself, "Ooh, dangerous!"</i>

09:12.969 --> 09:14.679
<i>"I wish I could participate."</i>

09:16.681 --> 09:19.267
<i>Right? It makes you feel 99% free.</i>

09:22.645 --> 09:26.148
<i>It's okay. We being honest here.</i>
<i>Right? All of you have done it.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:29.193
<i>You got comfortable</i>
<i>with your first Black person.</i>

09:29.986 --> 09:32.321
<i>Right? You waited for your moment.</i>

09:33.948 --> 09:36.367
<i>You try to slip a "nigga"</i>
<i>into the situation.</i>

09:37.451 --> 09:38.703
<i>Be honest.</i>

09:40.788 --> 09:44.041
<i>And you didn't get the response</i>
<i>you was looking for. Did you?</i>

09:46.002 --> 09:48.796
<i>Then, what did you do?</i>
<i>You try to act confused.</i>

09:48.879 --> 09:52.466
<i>[nervously] "I'm sorry. It's just a word.</i>
<i>Y'all be saying it, and…"</i>

09:52.550 --> 09:54.051
<i>"What if it's in a song?"</i>

09:55.052 --> 09:57.722
<i>"What if it ends with an 'A'</i>
<i>and not an 'ER'?"</i>

09:58.222 --> 09:59.932
<i>All that bullshit. Right?</i>

10:00.016 --> 10:01.892
<i>Here's the thing. I'll give it to you.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:05.605
<i>Logically speaking,</i>
<i>it don't make 100% sense.</i>

10:06.564 --> 10:09.066
<i>But it don't have to.</i>
<i>Just follow the rules, nigga.</i>

10:10.484 --> 10:12.111
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:15.823
<i>Because you do understand the concept</i>

<i>that there's certain shit</i>
<i>you just can't say to certain people.</i>

10:19.076 --> 10:21.621
<i>You only get confused</i>
<i>with the word "nigga."</i>

10:22.121 --> 10:25.791
<i>For example, you don't call</i>
<i>your mother by her first name.</i>

10:26.375 --> 10:28.210
<i>Unless you a fucking weirdo.</i>

10:29.503 --> 10:32.298
<i>Right? Only the weird kids</i>
<i>did that where I'm from.</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:34.592
<i>Right? Sir, what is your mother's name?</i>

10:34.675 --> 10:36.552
<i>-[man] Eileen.</i>
<i>-Eileen.</i>

<i>-Do you call her Eileen to her face?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

10:39.055 --> 10:40.097
<i>No. Not at all.</i>

10:41.390 --> 10:43.726
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>
<i>That's her name, is it not?</i>

10:43.809 --> 10:45.728
<i>-Other people call her Eileen?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

10:45.811 --> 10:47.563

<i>-Right?</i>

<i>-No, sir.</i>
<i>-It ends with an "A," not an "ER."</i>

11:16.676 --> 11:19.303
<i>But you don't fucking call her that.</i>

<i>-[audience applauds]</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

11:22.139 --> 11:23.015
<i>That's…</i>

<i>Okay. One last one.</i>
<i>Sir, what is your mother's first name?</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
<i>-[man] Carol.</i>
<i>-Carol.</i>

11:27.019 --> 11:28.938

<i>No!</i>

<i>See how easy it is</i>
<i>not to say "nigga" to people?</i>

11:34.110 --> 11:36.112
<i>[audience applauding]</i>

11:37.571 --> 11:38.406
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:44.870 --> 11:45.996
<i>Now here's the irony.</i>

11:46.080 --> 11:50.167
<i>The first person that ever called me</i>
<i>a nigga was my grandmother.</i>

11:51.252 --> 11:53.587
<i>Yeah. I'll never forget.</i>
<i>I was seven years old.</i>

11:53.671 --> 11:58.217
<i>She called me from all the way across</i>
<i>her big-ass slave plantation of a house.</i>

12:00.052 --> 12:03.848
<i>Right? Something y'all need to understand</i>
<i>about being a child in the '80s,</i>

12:03.931 --> 12:07.184
<i>is one, when your parents</i>
<i>called you from across the house,</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:10.187
<i>you had to go see what they wanted.</i>
<i>You couldn't yell back.</i>

12:11.063 --> 12:12.523
<i>Right? You couldn't… "Brian!"</i>

12:12.606 --> 12:15.651
<i>You couldn't be like, "What?"</i>
<i>That'd get you fucked up. Right?</i>

12:16.819 --> 12:18.404
<i>And the second thing is,</i>

12:19.071 --> 12:22.992
<i>home video games was new</i>
<i>and there wasn't no saves, nigga. So…</i>

12:23.075 --> 12:24.910
<i>And grandma didn't give a fuck…</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:30.332
<i>how long you was playing </i>Mario Bros.,
<i>how far you got, how difficult it was.</i>

12:30.416 --> 12:32.376
<i>"Get your ass up here." Right?</i>

12:33.586 --> 12:36.255
<i>She called me from across the house.</i>
<i>I passed the sticks.</i>

12:37.882 --> 12:41.177
<i>And </i>all<i> she wanted</i>
<i>was for me to open the window</i>

12:41.677 --> 12:44.180
<i>that she was sitting right beside.</i>

12:45.222 --> 12:47.391
<i>Right? Straight power play.</i>

12:50.603 --> 12:52.605
<i>Right? And I know</i>
<i>I didn't say it out loud,</i>

12:52.688 --> 12:55.399
<i>but she heard "lazy bitch"</i>
<i>or whatever. Right?</i>

13:00.863 --> 13:04.867
<i>She lost her fucking mind, son.</i>

13:04.950 --> 13:07.369
<i>All of a sudden, no arthritis.</i>

13:09.163 --> 13:11.165
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

13:13.083 --> 13:15.002
<i>She hopped up out of this chair.</i>

13:15.836 --> 13:19.131
<i>She doubled in size</i>
<i>like an anime villain. Right?</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:23.427
<i>And I'll never forget this moment.</i>
<i>It's burned into my brain.</i>

13:23.928 --> 13:25.596
<i>She goes, "Nigga,</i>

13:27.264 --> 13:30.768
<i>it's about to be some smoke</i>
<i>in the motherfucking city!"</i>

13:34.438 --> 13:35.272
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:35.356 --> 13:38.818
<i>Something else you need to understand</i>
<i>is that all older Black women,</i>

13:38.901 --> 13:40.319
<i>they have a glossary</i>

13:41.529 --> 13:42.738
<i>of threats</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:46.242
<i>that are also riddles.</i>

13:51.872 --> 13:55.709
<i>They serve two purposes.</i>
<i>One is to confuse the opponent…</i>

13:57.670 --> 14:00.381
<i>and the second</i>
<i>is to make you sound crazy</i>

14:00.464 --> 14:02.383
<i>if you call Child Protective Services.</i>

14:02.466 --> 14:03.342
<i>Right?</i>

14:06.929 --> 14:09.056
<i>But I'm seven. I don't know riddles.</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:13.310
<i>So I just have this look</i>
<i>of confusion on my face. I'm confused.</i>

14:14.311 --> 14:16.480
<i>But something else I didn't know,</i>
<i>'cause I was seven,</i>

14:16.564 --> 14:19.233
<i>is that the look of confusion</i>
<i>is the same look</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:21.986
<i>as, "Fuck you trying to do, bitch?"</i>

14:25.406 --> 14:29.326
<i>And that's how she interpreted it.</i>
<i>You know? As a direct challenge.</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:35.791
<i>She grabbed me under my armpit,</i>
<i>hit me with a vicious knee. Boom!</i>

14:36.458 --> 14:38.210
<i>Did a perfect hip toss.</i>

14:39.378 --> 14:43.048
<i>Threw me into the opposite wall.</i>
<i>I fucking landed upside down on my head.</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:46.427
<i>Now, by this time,</i>
<i>all the other kids she was babysitting</i>

14:46.510 --> 14:48.304
<i>in the house, they gathered around.</i>

14:48.387 --> 14:50.598
<i>Nieces, nephews,</i>
<i>neighbors' kids, grandbabies.</i>

14:50.681 --> 14:53.434
<i>We liked to see each other</i>
<i>get fucked up back then. Right?</i>

14:54.518 --> 14:56.312
<i>She wanted to set an example.</i>
<i>She goes,</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:58.397
<i>"Now what did you learn, little nigga?"</i>

15:00.482 --> 15:02.902
<i>I know what she wanted.</i>
<i>She wanted me to be like,</i>

15:02.985 --> 15:06.906
<i>"Don't ever talk back to you</i>
<i>or call you…" [blubbering]</i>

15:06.989 --> 15:08.782
<i>Right? That's what she wanted.</i>

15:08.866 --> 15:11.410
<i>And if it was any other day,</i>
<i>I would've gave her that.</i>

15:13.370 --> 15:18.167
<i>But something deep down in me</i>
<i>that day was like, "Today, we fight back."</i>

15:21.837 --> 15:24.173
<i>And she goes,</i>
<i>"What did you learn, little nigga?"</i>

15:24.256 --> 15:28.093
<i>I was like, "Well, you had the energy</i>
<i>to throw me across the kitchen."</i>

15:28.177 --> 15:30.512
<i>"You could've just got up</i>
<i>and opened the window…"</i>

15:30.596 --> 15:32.848
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

15:40.147 --> 15:41.106
<i>"…Cynthia."</i>

15:41.815 --> 15:43.776
<i>[audience exclaims in shock]</i>

15:48.739 --> 15:51.075
<i>I was in the hospital for two days.</i>

15:54.203 --> 15:56.497
<i>And on the third day,</i>
<i>I was in foster care.</i>

15:59.875 --> 16:03.003
<i>The wild shit about foster care,</i>
<i>they send you to therapy right away.</i>

16:03.087 --> 16:04.838
<i>Seven years old talking to a therapist.</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:08.008
<i>And you know the state</i>
<i>can't afford the expensive therapists.</i>

16:08.092 --> 16:10.761
<i>So they get these white girls</i>
<i>fresh out of college.</i>

16:12.972 --> 16:15.933
<i>Right? They only seen Black people</i>
<i>in pamphlets and shit.</i>

16:16.016 --> 16:17.267
<i>You know? They don't…</i>

16:19.186 --> 16:21.522
<i>And they try to be relatable and shit.</i>

16:21.605 --> 16:24.525
<i>I would fire 'em all the time.</i>
<i>"Fuck you, bitch. Fuck you."</i>

16:25.150 --> 16:27.027
<i>Because they'd always start the same way.</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:30.239
<i>"Hey. Listen, little man.</i>
<i>Says here you've been traumatized."</i>

16:32.032 --> 16:36.453
<i>"Yeah, and you having trouble</i>
<i>trusting adults, but you can trust me."</i>

16:36.537 --> 16:37.830
<i>"I'm Dr. Trust."</i>

16:39.039 --> 16:42.001
<i>"Anything you say to me</i>
<i>is just between you and I."</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:46.964
<i>"In fact, it's against the law</i>
<i>for me to share it with anybody else."</i>

16:47.464 --> 16:51.969
<i>"Unless you tell me that you're thinking</i>
<i>about harming yourself or someone else."</i>

16:52.052 --> 16:53.762
<i>"Then I have to report that."</i>

16:54.263 --> 16:57.099
<i>I be like, "Okay.</i>
<i>Well, I guess we're done here, bitch."</i>

16:57.182 --> 16:58.892
<i>"'Cause that's all I think about…</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:01.478
<i>is revenge." [laughs]</i>

17:02.396 --> 17:04.231
<i>Right? I'm gonna get that old bitch.</i>

17:06.442 --> 17:09.528
<i>Yeah. So it took me a while,</i>
<i>but I figured it out late. Okay?</i>

17:09.611 --> 17:11.155
<i>To get the full life hack,</i>

17:11.238 --> 17:14.199
<i>you need a therapist </i>and<i> a priest.</i>

17:15.367 --> 17:18.037
<i>Right. You don't have</i>
<i>to be Catholic to talk to a priest.</i>

17:18.120 --> 17:20.998
<i>Just walk into a Catholic church.</i>
<i>They welcome. You know?</i>

17:21.540 --> 17:22.958
<i>You can tell a priest anything.</i>

17:23.042 --> 17:25.502
<i>You could tell a priest</i>
<i>you just killed somebody</i>

17:25.586 --> 17:27.713
<i>and they'll be like,</i>
<i>"Say two 'Our Fathers'</i>

17:28.672 --> 17:31.008
<i>and drop something in the collections."</i>
<i>You know?</i>

17:33.635 --> 17:36.055
<i>But priests don't write prescriptions.</i>
<i>You know?</i>

17:36.555 --> 17:38.599
<i>So if you want 360 coverage…</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:42.519
<i>you need both. Right?</i>
<i>You get a therapist and a priest.</i>

17:42.603 --> 17:45.981
<i>You use the priest,</i>
<i>tell him who you want to kill,</i>

17:46.899 --> 17:49.777
<i>and you tell the therapist</i>
<i>who molested you.</i>

17:50.694 --> 17:53.655
<i>-[audience members exclaim]</i>
<i>-[scattered applause]</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:58.702
<i>It was the priest, guys.</i>
<i>Are y'all keeping up with me?</i>

18:00.162 --> 18:02.039
<i>Salvation ain't free.</i>

18:02.122 --> 18:03.332
<i>Give up them cheeks.</i>

18:03.415 --> 18:05.417
<i>[audience members groaning]</i>

18:08.504 --> 18:09.338
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:09.963 --> 18:11.298
<i>That's why I do drugs.</i>

18:13.675 --> 18:15.761
<i>Yeah, man.</i>
<i>I don't get these drug-free people.</i>

18:15.844 --> 18:16.845
<i>Drugs get a bad rep</i>

18:16.929 --> 18:19.515
<i>'cause they ruin</i>
<i>people's lives or whatever, but…</i>

18:21.725 --> 18:23.060
<i>so does reality.</i>

18:25.771 --> 18:27.397
<i>Why are drugs illegal for everybody</i>

18:27.481 --> 18:30.150
<i>just because some of y'all</i>
<i>can't keep your shit together?</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:32.236
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

18:32.319 --> 18:34.488
<i>[audience cheers and applauds]</i>

18:38.283 --> 18:40.077
<i>It should be like points on your license.</i>

18:40.160 --> 18:43.163
<i>If you keep fucking up on drugs,</i>
you <i>can't do drugs.</i>

18:43.956 --> 18:47.876
<i>You gotta go to the DMV and get approved</i>
<i>for your drugs every year.</i>

18:48.961 --> 18:51.880
<i>Like, "Hey. Look.</i>
<i>You good for the mushrooms,</i>

18:51.964 --> 18:53.841
<i>but you fucked up at the last Coachella."</i>

18:53.924 --> 18:56.677
<i>"No molly for you</i>
<i>for the rest of the year."</i>

18:57.344 --> 18:59.054
<i>That seems reasonable to me.</i>

19:00.556 --> 19:01.723
<i>These anti-drug people,</i>

19:01.807 --> 19:04.726
<i>what they won't admit</i>
<i>is some people are better on drugs.</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:08.730
<i>Right? Some people at they best on drugs.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:10.983
<i>You ever have a friend get sober</i>

19:11.066 --> 19:13.193
<i>and then you realize they lame as fuck?</i>

19:18.115 --> 19:21.952
<i>The problem is, we look at drugs</i>
<i>like there are good drugs and bad drugs.</i>

19:22.035 --> 19:23.078
<i>That's not true.</i>

19:23.579 --> 19:26.623
<i>There's just the right drugs</i>
<i>and the wrong drugs for you.</i>

19:27.666 --> 19:29.585
<i>There's no good drug, bad drug.</i>

19:29.668 --> 19:32.629
<i>Okay? That's just your way</i>
<i>to fucking judge people.</i>

19:32.713 --> 19:34.173
<i>I'll give you a perfect example.</i>

19:34.256 --> 19:36.967
<i>We all agree meth</i>
<i>is a dirty, ugly, nasty drug. Right?</i>

19:37.050 --> 19:39.678
<i>Methamphetamines destroys people. Yeah.</i>

19:39.761 --> 19:40.721
<i>But guess what?</i>

19:41.221 --> 19:45.058
<i>There's a 24-hour McDonald's</i>
<i>in Los Angeles that I love.</i>

19:50.480 --> 19:54.193
<i>And the night manager,</i>
<i>the guy that work 11:00 to 7:00,</i>

19:55.569 --> 19:57.613
<i>he is always on meth.</i>

19:59.072 --> 20:01.867
<i>Every time I see this guy,</i>
<i>he's on 11, son.</i>

20:04.119 --> 20:05.704
<i>But whenever he's in the building,</i>

20:05.787 --> 20:08.916
<i>all the sandwiches come out</i>
<i>looking just like the pictures.</i>

<i>-Yeah. My personal drug is weed.</i>
<i>-[audience member cheers]</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:24.097
<i>I… It's not really something to cheer.</i>
<i>It's just an activity. Um…</i>

20:25.724 --> 20:29.144
<i>I learned the hard way a long time ago</i>
<i>that it's not good to be a stoner.</i>

20:29.228 --> 20:31.355
<i>Just high all day every day.</i>
<i>You can't do that.</i>

20:31.438 --> 20:35.734
<i>You should never be high in a situation</i>
<i>where you can't risk being confused.</i>

20:38.111 --> 20:42.157
<i>Okay? 'Cause weed can fuck you up.</i>
<i>There is a such thing as "too high."</i>

20:42.950 --> 20:44.660
<i>Right? And when you get too high,</i>

20:44.743 --> 20:46.578
<i>some people describe it as paranoia.</i>

20:47.454 --> 20:48.956
<i>But what it really is,</i>

20:49.039 --> 20:53.252
<i>is that you just keep thinking when you</i>
<i>normally would've stopped thinking.</i>

20:54.962 --> 20:55.837
<i>Right?</i>

20:55.921 --> 20:58.507
<i>Your normal thought process is,</i>

20:58.590 --> 21:02.094
<i>you ponder something,</i>
<i>you reach a conclusion, you're finished.</i>

21:03.553 --> 21:04.596
<i>When you're too high,</i>

21:04.680 --> 21:07.099
<i>you ponder something,</i>
<i>you reach a conclusion,</i>

21:07.182 --> 21:10.727
<i>then you ponder the conclusion,</i>
<i>then you ponder that conclusion…</i>

21:10.811 --> 21:12.020
<i>Next thing you know,</i>

21:12.104 --> 21:14.982
<i>you way the fuck out on left field</i>
<i>from when you started. Right?</i>

21:15.941 --> 21:19.486
<i>Last time I got way too high,</i>
<i>I turned to my friend and said, "Hey, uh,</i>

21:19.569 --> 21:24.157
<i>have they ever thought about just giving</i>
<i>pedophiles their own baby pictures?"</i>

21:30.247 --> 21:31.665
<i>"That's a victimless crime."</i>

<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>"Man, that's brilliant, but, uh…</i>

21:41.675 --> 21:43.427
<i>we were talking about the economy."</i>

21:43.510 --> 21:46.054
<i>I was like, "Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm fucking high. Sorry."</i>

21:46.138 --> 21:48.140
<i>[scattered applause]</i>

21:49.308 --> 21:50.142
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:50.684 --> 21:53.770
<i>This is when I really learned</i>
<i>the lesson you can't be too high. So…</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:56.273
<i>I was too high one day</i>
<i>and I was on WebMD.</i>

21:56.898 --> 21:58.150
<i>-[audience groans]</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

21:58.233 --> 21:59.735
<i>Yeah. And if you not familiar,</i>

21:59.818 --> 22:03.113
<i>WebMD is just a website</i>
<i>for hypochondriacs.</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:08.535
<i>It's just an online doctor to help you</i>
<i>diagnose yourself with diseases,</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:12.122
<i>with no medical professionals present.</i>
<i>Right? It's a horrible idea.</i>

22:12.706 --> 22:14.750
<i>And the way it works is, you go there,</i>

22:14.833 --> 22:18.754
<i>there's a drawing of a human,</i>
<i>you click on whatever part of you hurts.</i>

22:19.254 --> 22:21.423
<i>They zoom in,</i>
<i>and on the left side of the screen</i>

22:21.506 --> 22:25.093
<i>they give you a list of all the symptoms</i>
<i>that part of you could possibly have.</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:26.595
<i>If you click on a symptom,</i>

22:26.678 --> 22:30.390
<i>on other side of the screen</i>
<i>they'll give you 5,000 diseases</i>

22:30.474 --> 22:31.683
<i>that you might have.</i>

22:32.184 --> 22:36.104
<i>And if you click on another symptom,</i>
<i>that 5,000 goes down to 2,500.</i>

22:36.188 --> 22:38.482
<i>Another symptom,</i>
<i>it goes down to 1,000. Right?</i>

22:38.565 --> 22:41.985
<i>But here's the bullshit.</i>
<i>You will never get it down to one.</i>

22:43.403 --> 22:46.615
<i>You can click every symptom in that list,</i>
<i>and you'll never get it down to one.</i>

22:46.698 --> 22:49.117
<i>You'll end up</i>
<i>with at least three diseases.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:50.702
<i>Maybe you familiar with a couple,</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:53.163
<i>but at least one of 'em</i>
<i>will scare the shit out of you.</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:56.083
<i>If you tell WebMD,</i>
<i>"Oh, I have a sore throat,"</i>

22:56.166 --> 22:58.251
<i>WebMD will be like, "Oh, that's the…</i>

22:58.335 --> 22:59.461
<i>That's that COVID."</i>

22:59.544 --> 23:01.880
<i>You like, "No, man. I'm double vaxxed."</i>

<i>They're like, "That's the seasonal flu."</i>

23:03.924 --> 23:06.718
<i>You're like, "No, man.</i>
<i>I got my flu vaccine after the COVID."</i>

23:06.802 --> 23:10.055
<i>Like, "Okay. Well, that's full-blown AIDS.</i>
<i>You're gonna die."</i>

23:10.597 --> 23:11.431
<i>Um…</i>

23:14.393 --> 23:15.560
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:22.192
<i>So everybody knows what weed does,</i>
<i>knows what WebMD is. Here's my story.</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:25.570
<i>I'm too high.</i>
<i>I'm on this website. My throat hurts.</i>

23:26.571 --> 23:29.616
<i>I click on "neck."</i>
<i>I'm scrolling through the neck symptoms.</i>

23:30.492 --> 23:34.871
<i>And one of the symptoms</i>
<i>is "short, wide neck."</i>

23:37.958 --> 23:38.792
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:39.292 --> 23:41.795
<i>You may have noticed</i>
<i>I have a short, wide neck.</i>

23:42.546 --> 23:45.590
<i>Um, I've always had</i>
<i>a bigger-than-usual head</i>

23:46.091 --> 23:48.260
<i>since my grandma</i>
<i>threw me against the wall.</i>

23:49.970 --> 23:53.473
<i>And my neck has just grown thicker</i>
<i>to keep it stable. Right?</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:55.600
<i>So, I'm just curious,</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:57.727
<i>what the fuck disease</i>

23:58.228 --> 23:59.688
<i>is that a symptom for?</i>

24:00.313 --> 24:01.565
<i>So I clicked on it.</i>

24:02.524 --> 24:05.068
<i>And this was my first time</i>
<i>ever using WebMD.</i>

24:05.152 --> 24:06.736
<i>I clicked on one symptom.</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:09.614
<i>I got one disease.</i>

24:11.324 --> 24:12.868
<i>It was Down syndrome.</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:15.078
<i>[audience exclaims and laughs]</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:17.706
<i>Yeah.</i>

24:19.416 --> 24:21.877
<i>And like I said,</i>
<i>under normal circumstances,</i>

24:22.878 --> 24:26.256
<i>I'd be fairly certain</i>
<i>that I don't have Down syndrome, right?</i>

24:27.799 --> 24:28.925
<i>I was very high.</i>

24:33.180 --> 24:36.475
<i>And so my first thought was,</i>
<i>"Brian, that is ridiculous."</i>

24:37.476 --> 24:41.062
<i>"You don't have Down syndrome.</i>
<i>Someone would've said something by now."</i>

24:47.068 --> 24:49.988
<i>But my next thought was, "Unless…</i>

24:52.449 --> 24:54.576
<i>part of having Down syndrome</i>

24:55.619 --> 24:58.538
<i>is believing you don't</i>
<i>have Down syndrome." Right? Like…</i>

25:00.874 --> 25:02.918
<i>What if this is just a delusion</i>

25:03.960 --> 25:06.338
<i>that I'm a real comedian, uh,</i>

25:06.421 --> 25:07.714
<i>on Netflix?</i>

25:09.257 --> 25:11.510
<i>But what's happening in reality is,</i>

25:12.093 --> 25:15.347
<i>I'm just standing on the table</i>
<i>at my Make-a-Wish benefit, and…</i>

25:15.430 --> 25:17.432
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

25:20.227 --> 25:23.772
<i>Y'all are just cheering for me 'cause</i>
<i>I'm retarded and I'm trying my hardest.</i>

25:23.855 --> 25:26.316
<i>Like, "Oh, no. He is so brave."</i>

25:27.526 --> 25:28.818
<i>"Look at him."</i>

25:29.361 --> 25:30.737
<i>"Going after it."</i>

25:35.951 --> 25:40.330
<i>Listen. I know some of you</i>
<i>are, uh, judging me</i>

25:40.413 --> 25:43.250
<i>for my use of the word "retarded."</i>

25:43.333 --> 25:46.044
<i>I wanna address that directly, head-on.</i>

25:48.129 --> 25:50.340
<i>Okay. I want you to know</i>
<i>it was not an accident.</i>

25:50.423 --> 25:51.758
<i>I'm a professional.</i>

25:52.884 --> 25:55.512
<i>I continue to use the word "retarded"</i>

25:56.304 --> 26:00.100
<i>because I always</i>
<i>let retarded people say "nigga."</i>

26:00.850 --> 26:02.227
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

26:02.310 --> 26:03.562
<i>A deal's a deal.</i>

26:07.649 --> 26:09.067
<i>It's not for everybody.</i>

26:11.361 --> 26:12.737
<i>It's not for everybody.</i>

26:20.954 --> 26:23.123
<i>I wanna tell y'all, uh,</i>

26:23.206 --> 26:27.377
<i>the story of how Google saved my life.</i>

26:28.670 --> 26:32.257
<i>Yeah. Google the corporation,</i>
<i>the evil fucking monster.</i>

26:32.340 --> 26:34.551
<i>They're the reason I'm alive today.</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:38.138
<i>Right? And if you don't know this,</i>

26:38.221 --> 26:41.683
<i>Google will not tell you</i>
<i>how to kill yourself.</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:43.768
<i>Did you know that?</i>

26:43.852 --> 26:46.563
<i>If you Google, "How do I kill myself?"</i>

26:46.646 --> 26:49.107
<i>Google will respond, "You're not alone."</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:53.069
<i>And they'll give you</i>
<i>the number to the suicide hotline.</i>

26:53.570 --> 26:56.239
<i>Right. Which is kind of bullshit,</i>
<i>'cause, like…</i>

26:56.781 --> 27:00.076
<i>I mean, we live in a country</i>
<i>where every other emergency is 911,</i>

27:00.160 --> 27:02.162
<i>but if you about to blow</i>
<i>your fucking brains out,</i>

27:02.245 --> 27:04.164
<i>it's a 1-800 number that nobody knows.</i>

27:05.123 --> 27:07.917
<i>And it's not even one of the catchy ones</i>
<i>that spells a word,</i>

27:08.001 --> 27:09.711
<i>like "1-800-dentist" or something.</i>

27:09.794 --> 27:11.963
<i>It's just random digits.</i>

27:13.840 --> 27:17.969
<i>But anyway, Google would not</i>
<i>tell me how to kill myself.</i>

27:18.053 --> 27:21.389
<i>So I had to go to Reddit,</i>
<i>and Reddit was like, "Oh, that's easy."</i>

27:21.473 --> 27:24.017
<i>[audience laughs and applauds]</i>

27:25.518 --> 27:27.437
<i>"Suicide? We got five of those."</i>

27:28.229 --> 27:31.691
<i>And I learned a lesson that day.</i>
<i>I learned that, uh,</i>

27:31.775 --> 27:34.736
<i>your body's panic response to breathe,</i>

27:34.819 --> 27:37.197
<i>that doesn't come</i>
<i>from you not getting oxygen,</i>

27:37.280 --> 27:40.241
<i>it comes from you not expelling CO2.</i>

27:40.325 --> 27:41.660
<i>Right? So basically,</i>

27:41.743 --> 27:45.205
<i>if you just breathe in an inert gas,</i>
<i>you'll just pass out. Right?</i>

27:45.288 --> 27:48.833
<i>So the best thing to do</i>
<i>is go get a used car.</i>

27:50.043 --> 27:52.170
<i>Right? One that won't pass the smog.</i>

27:52.253 --> 27:54.589
<i>Preferably something before the year 2000.</i>

27:55.382 --> 27:57.384
<i>Right? Park it in the garage,</i>

27:57.467 --> 28:01.012
<i>run a hose from the tailpipe</i>
<i>to a cracked window,</i>

28:01.638 --> 28:02.972
<i>start it up,</i>

28:03.056 --> 28:04.933
<i>put on your favorite jam,</i>

28:06.059 --> 28:07.811
<i>and then wait to meet Jesus.</i>

28:08.895 --> 28:10.939
<i>I was like, "Oh, that is easy."</i>

28:11.022 --> 28:13.775
<i>"How come Google</i>
<i>wouldn't just fucking tell me that?"</i>

28:15.610 --> 28:19.739
<i>So I went to go e-mail my therapist</i>
<i>to cancel my future appointments. Right?</i>

28:21.449 --> 28:23.284
<i>And I open up my Gmail</i>

28:23.910 --> 28:27.163
<i>and there's a Google ad for a '97 Camry.</i>

28:27.247 --> 28:29.582
<i>And I was like, "Oh, these motherfuckers."</i>

28:32.168 --> 28:34.212
<i>"Trying to profit off the back-end."</i>

28:34.295 --> 28:35.964
<i>[audience applauds]</i>

28:38.174 --> 28:40.218
<i>So I'm staying alive out of spite.</i>

28:41.469 --> 28:43.221
<i>As long as there's a Google,</i>

28:44.180 --> 28:45.849
<i>there'll be a Brian Simpson.</i>

28:45.932 --> 28:48.435
