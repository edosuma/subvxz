00:01.660 --> 00:03.525
_ PETER:
Again, I want to thank you
for your service.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.492
My assistant
will validate your parking.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.204
I'm sending these infractions
of Mr. Gardner's

00:11.240 --> 00:12.400
to the bar association.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.603
If you won't pursue him,
they will.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.473
Do what you gotta do.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.011
Now get out of my office.

00:20.850 --> 00:23.444
* Here I go

00:23.490 --> 00:26.414
* Watch me
* Here she goes,
here she goes now *

00:26.460 --> 00:28.655
* Here I go again

00:28.690 --> 00:30.521
* On my own

00:30.560 --> 00:32.391
* Here she goes, here she goes *

00:32.430 --> 00:36.366
* Going down the only road
I've ever known *

00:36.400 --> 00:37.697
* Ooh-ooh *

00:37.730 --> 00:41.131
* Like a drifter I was born
to walk alone... *

00:41.170 --> 00:42.535
It's over.

00:42.570 --> 00:44.060
It is.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.668
Odd, huh?

00:45.710 --> 00:46.802
Get used to it.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.479
Diane, Viola Walsh on line one.
Yeah. Be right there.

00:49.510 --> 00:51.444
Syna?
Yeah, we go to
court tomorrow.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.415
My guess, an
eleventh-hour offer.

00:54.450 --> 00:56.441
Oh, and, Will,
Cary Agos for you.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.718
Oh. There it is.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.411
The official word.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.224
Or he wants
to indict me again.
(laughs)

01:02.260 --> 01:04.251
WILL (on phone):
Hey, Cary, how you doing?

01:04.290 --> 01:06.121
Ah, I'm okay.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.559
I think you know
why I'm calling.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.591
IhopeI know
why you're calling.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.739
You're safe.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.565
No indictment, and we're
not coming after you again.

01:17.610 --> 01:18.736
Thanks.

01:18.770 --> 01:21.102
No. No, you guys,
you played this smart.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.671
Go celebrate.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.075
Thanks, man.

01:30.450 --> 01:33.453
You have 23 calls.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.287
All congratulations.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.481
Six judges among them,
and Lionel Deerfield.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.452
He said it was important
you call him tonight,

01:39.500 --> 01:41.354
it's an emergency.
Yep.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.560
I think I can do without

01:43.600 --> 01:45.568
Lionel Deerfield's
good cheer tonight.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.568
* Here I go

01:47.600 --> 01:49.602
* I guess

01:49.640 --> 01:50.834
* I'm just

01:50.870 --> 01:53.805
_ * Another heart
In need of rescue *

01:53.840 --> 01:56.707
* Waiting on love's sweet

01:56.750 --> 01:59.469
* Sweet charity...

01:59.520 --> 02:02.284
DIANE:
They're on their way in now.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.185
No, we're setting things up now.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.450
Okay. Thanks, Alicia.
See you in a minute.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.479
I want in.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.249
(laughs)

02:09.290 --> 02:10.484
I handed it off when I thought

02:10.530 --> 02:11.383
I was going to jail.
I'm not going to jail.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.694
You had a brush with death,
my friend.

02:13.730 --> 02:14.856
Take a week.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.390
No, the adrenaline's pumping.

02:16.430 --> 02:17.590
I'm ready to take someone down.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.460
Okay, then.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.559
Let's take 'em down.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.398
(upbeat music playing)

02:33.250 --> 02:34.319
WILL:
HI.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.614
Hi.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.811
I'm so glad, Will, really.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.852
I am, too.
Thank you.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.482
So, anyway,
they're going to be here

02:44.530 --> 02:45.588
in a few minutes
for negotiations.

02:45.630 --> 02:46.722
Can you greet them?
Sure.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.648
Viola Walsh.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.497
Yeah. Why?

02:50.530 --> 02:51.929
Last time she was here,

02:51.970 --> 02:53.597
she asked me to join her firm.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.631
Really?

02:56.570 --> 02:58.606
Maybe you could use that.
(laughs)

02:58.640 --> 03:00.608
(elevator bell dings, music
and party chatter continues)

03:00.640 --> 03:02.847
Ms. Walsh.
Mr. Gross.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.507
Y
es, and you're...?

03:04.550 --> 03:06.518
Alicia. Florrick.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.847
Oh. Yes, right.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.542
So, this is where
creativity goes to die.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.558
Oh, no, that's
the next floor.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.682
Is that supposed
to be funny?

03:13.720 --> 03:15.381
It-it is.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.684
Well, I didn't
think it was funny.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.288
Must've been
my delivery.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.321
This way, please.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.619
(Alicia clears throat)

03:24.670 --> 03:26.490
Diane!

03:26.540 --> 03:27.666
William.

03:27.700 --> 03:28.860
My two favorite people.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.367
Viola. Always a pleasure.

03:30.410 --> 03:31.707
And Neil Gross,
in his patented hoodie.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.276
I'm just waiting to
get my blood sucked.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.232
We seem to be catching you
in the middle of a party.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.441
Casual Wednesdays.
VIOLA:
Wow.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.244
Look at these
wonderful exhibits.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.679
Well, you just seem to be

03:41.720 --> 03:43.540
girding yourself for battle,
aren't you?

03:43.590 --> 03:44.409
Hello.

03:44.450 --> 03:46.554
Oh, this is Caitlin.
She's sitting in.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.683
GROSS:
Can we start?

03:48.720 --> 03:50.358
Mr. Gross, hello.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.551
You created a suite
of software...
VIOLA: Oh, excuse me.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.522
We _don't need to
reVIew the case.
Oh, this isn't a review.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.993
This is my opening argument.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.691
Oh.
You created a suite of

03:57.730 --> 03:59.994
decryption software
entitled CoursePoint.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.769
It's not decryption software.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.301
It's data-mining.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.365
And your company sold it
to the Syrian government.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.900
We would deny that.
And the Syrian electronic army

04:06.940 --> 04:10.376
used this software
to decrypt and obstruct

04:10.410 --> 04:12.310
private e-mails
and chats in order to

04:12.350 --> 04:14.773
arrest, torture,
and murder protestors.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.618
We represent the three
American protestors,

04:17.650 --> 04:19.459
and we are asking that
their families be awarded

04:19.490 --> 04:20.889
$1 million for damages

04:20.920 --> 04:23.457
Uh...
and $16 million
for pain and suffering.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.720
Maybe my taste for hypocrisy
is at an all-time low.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.819
Discussing dissidents while

04:27.860 --> 04:29.396
party music's playing
in the next room...

04:29.430 --> 04:31.466
Can we just get to the
core of the problem?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.661
You don't care about
these protestors.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.497
You care about your top
client, Patric Edelstein.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.303
Oops.
He's battling me for control

04:37.340 --> 04:38.500
of the international
sobeare market.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.030
This is just one more attempt

04:40.080 --> 04:41.809
to embarrass me in order
to make way for hIm.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.047
It's death by
a thousand paper cuts.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.399
This is one paper cut.

04:45.450 --> 04:47.475
Yes. We represent
your chief competitor.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.819
But no, this is not
about paper cuts.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.750
This is about the families
of Mohammed Hazouri,

04:52.790 --> 04:55.350
Amy Newton,
and Sara Fellner.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.585
Okay. All good to know.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.598
But here's our offer.
Are you ready?

04:59.630 --> 05:02.497
$100,000 and
an endowed scholarship

05:02.530 --> 05:03.895
to advance the causes

05:03.930 --> 05:05.090
exemplified by
these fine youths,

05:05.130 --> 05:07.098
and a joint statement
of agreement

05:07.140 --> 05:09.335
saying that
we will more strictly supervise

05:09.370 --> 05:11.338
third-party sales
of our software.

05:11.370 --> 05:12.803
CAITLIN:
That's why you
brought us in here?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.009
(whispering):
M-May I speak to you
for a moment, please?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.747
Caitlin...

05:22.790 --> 05:24.644
I know you thought you were
being helpful in there,

05:24.690 --> 05:25.816
but you really
shouldn't talk.

05:25.850 --> 05:27.351
Will asked me to.

05:27.390 --> 05:29.449
He... What?

05:29.490 --> 05:31.629
Will asked me to say that,
no matter what their offer was.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.497
Uh, how close are we, Samir?

05:36.530 --> 05:38.521
Uh, why? Is there
somewhere else you need to be?

05:38.570 --> 05:39.832
Yeah.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.758
You know, it's tough
getting cross town.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.007
You need to come to Syria,
Kalinda. You live in boredom.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.735
Our days are filled
with excitement.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.431
You make it sound very tempting.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.745
Two protestors dead
in Damascus today.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.714
Yes, I know. I...

05:53.650 --> 05:55.845
(Samir speaking quietly)

05:55.880 --> 05:58.485
I should have confirmation on
the middleman in three minutes.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.380
_ KALINDA:
You keeping yourself safe there?

06:01.420 --> 06:03.081
Oh, yes.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.859
I have friends in
the Mukhabarat, the Shabeeha,

06:04.890 --> 06:06.391
and the protestors.

06:06.430 --> 06:07.897
I have, uh,
covered my bases well.

06:07.930 --> 06:11.866
Oh, I saw, uh,
Barbara Walters yesterday.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.390
Really?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.691
Yes, uh, she was here
to interview our president.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.766
She had, um...
much better hair

06:17.810 --> 06:18.765
than I thought.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.630
(giggles, phone rings)
Uh, excuse me, Samir.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.898
Yes, Eli?
ELI:
Did you talk to Stacie Hall?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.144
Uh, it's not a good time.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.772
No. I need to know now.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.949
Did you talk to Stacie Hall
about my ex-wife?

06:27.980 --> 06:29.811
Can we discuss this later?
I'm on with Syria.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.738
No. Kalinda, I want...

06:31.790 --> 06:33.758
...right now.
What's the emergency, Eli?

06:33.790 --> 06:35.815
Why?
Why what?

06:35.860 --> 06:38.454
Why did my ex-wife hire Stacie
Hall as a campaign strategist

06:38.490 --> 06:39.798
for her upcoming
State Senate campaign?

06:39.830 --> 06:41.752
Why does my ex-husband care?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.768
I care because
she is my competition,

06:43.800 --> 06:45.927
and she has poached
three of my clients!

06:45.970 --> 06:48.165
So she's good?
(sighs loudly)

06:48.200 --> 06:50.464
Vanessa! She is
out destabilize me,

06:50.510 --> 06:52.137
and that is why she's
offering to represent you.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.432
Oh, really? My mistake.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.777
I thought my campaign
was about me,

06:54.810 --> 06:55.731
_but of course
it's about you.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.771
This is not narcissism, Vanessa.

06:57.810 --> 06:59.209
It's strategy.
Eli, you turned me down.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.478
I asked you to consult
on my campaign...

07:00.520 --> 07:03.648
Which I did.
...until we got into one
of our postmarital spats,

07:03.690 --> 07:04.816
and we decided
not to work together.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.818
So I sought out Stacie,
that's all.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.078
She didn't seek me out.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.781
Uh-oh.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.650
Eli's mind is at work.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.894
I get it.

07:13.930 --> 07:15.795
I get it. This is to try
and get me back

07:15.830 --> 07:17.559
on your campaign.
Oh, my God.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.828
You're telling me
it's just a coincidence

07:18.870 --> 07:20.497
that you pursued my competitor?
I'm not telling you anything.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.701
It makes sense. You have
your bin Laden problem...

07:22.740 --> 07:24.708
I didn't know he
was a bin Laden!

07:24.740 --> 07:26.002
And if I'm on your staff,
it looks better.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.701
"See? Her husband doesn't mind

07:27.740 --> 07:30.174
that she slept with
a bin Laden."
Okay. Thanks for this.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.075
Whenever I feel nostalgic
about our time together, Eli,

07:32.110 --> 07:34.908
you always toss me one of these
bracing little tte--ttes.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.625
Okay, okay, wait. Wait.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.628
Uh...

07:44.660 --> 07:46.651
(clears throat)

07:46.700 --> 07:47.928
Don't go with the green border.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.962
Why? It's about the environment.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.490
Yeah. Voters don't think
"nature" when they see green.

07:51.530 --> 07:54.067
They think "bad skin."
Look at the McCain campaign.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.637
And that is _not
your best Side.

07:56.670 --> 07:57.864
You know.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.731
You need warmer lighting.

08:00.780 --> 08:01.929
Gold is good for you.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.868
Stacie thought gold
was too on-the-nose.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.549
Oh, geez!
On-the-noseis good.

08:06.580 --> 08:09.140
You're not trying
to win the Nobel.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.147
Okay.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.987
Thanks, Eli.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.851
(clears throat)

08:13.890 --> 08:17.257
Do you really get nostalgic
about our time together?

08:18.260 --> 08:19.625
Good night, Eli.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.198
VIOLA:
Here's your problem.

08:23.230 --> 08:25.118
To win, you need to
prove two things:

08:25.170 --> 08:28.867
One, that my client knowingly
sold the software to Syria--

08:28.900 --> 08:30.003
a high bar in itself-- and two,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.929
that he knew that the software
would be used to capture

08:32.980 --> 08:34.572
and kill protestors.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.804
Good luck with that.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.979
You-you got the invoice
in your hand?

08:38.010 --> 08:41.639
Uh, yes. It was, uh,
routed through, uh, Dubai.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.819
Thanks, Samir.
Um, I'll be in touch, okay?

08:43.850 --> 08:45.841
No, no. I will be
in touch with you.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.654
Okay? Just send me an e-mail
with three question marks,

08:48.690 --> 08:51.022
and I will call you. Okay?

08:51.060 --> 08:52.948
It's, um... safer, that way.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.649
Okay, good. Um...

08:54.700 --> 08:55.826
Stay safe, my friend.

08:55.860 --> 09:00.035
WILL:
And as kind as your
financial offer is,

09:00.070 --> 09:01.890
we'll take our chances in court.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.305
Don't you want to check
with your clients first?

09:03.340 --> 09:04.762
They've given us
permission to reject

09:04.810 --> 09:06.004
any unreasonable amount.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.632
Well, you're not
going to get any more.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.931
I'll make it my life's mission

09:08.980 --> 09:11.801
to get more.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.841
(music and party chatter
continues)

09:14.680 --> 09:15.908
(sighs)

09:15.950 --> 09:16.746
That was odd.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.213
What was?
The offer was too lowball.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.615
It's like they're

09:20.660 --> 09:23.026
challenging us to
take it to court.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.288
Hello, Lionel.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.594
I would've called, but
it's been crazy here.

09:31.630 --> 09:32.597
Hello, Will.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.130
Can we go someplace
private?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.296
Sure.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.705
This way.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.903
* I like the way
you look at me *

09:39.940 --> 09:43.171
* Your pretty, pretty eyes...

09:43.210 --> 09:46.077
(light switch clicking)

09:46.110 --> 09:48.112
Things seem to be
falling apart here.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.914
So what's the emergency?

09:51.950 --> 09:53.781
Have you talked to
anybody at the bar?

09:53.820 --> 09:55.708
At the bar? What bar?

09:55.760 --> 09:58.058
The bar's Attorney Compliance
and Disciplinary Board.

09:58.090 --> 10:01.093
Oh. No. Why?

10:01.130 --> 10:03.098
We're pursuing your disbarment.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.937
Wh-What are you talking about?

10:11.970 --> 10:14.677
I'm on the
reVIew panel.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.132
Look, I know I shouldn't
be saying anything,

10:16.180 --> 10:17.943
I've_ been sworn to
confidentiality, but...

10:17.980 --> 10:21.040
we received anonymous
charges that you took

10:21.080 --> 10:23.241
$45,000 from a
client's account.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.918
And put it back.
15 years ago.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.884
There's no statute of
limitations with disbarment.

10:32.260 --> 10:35.093
We start disciplinary
proceedings tomorrow.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.998
I'm sorry, I just...

10:39.030 --> 10:40.895
I thought you
should know.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.101
Don't say I said anything.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.131
* I like the way
you look at me *

10:49.180 --> 10:51.045
(door closes)

10:51.080 --> 10:54.072
* Your pretty, pretty eyes

10:54.120 --> 10:57.283
* I like the way you love me

10:57.320 --> 11:01.017
*

11:01.060 --> 11:04.086
* I like the way
you hold my hand *

11:04.130 --> 11:07.429
* The way you
make me understand *

11:07.460 --> 11:10.861
* The way you tell me
that you love me *

11:10.900 --> 11:13.835
* As I love you.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.061
(people chattering)

11:20.810 --> 11:22.698
Uh, before we begin,

11:22.750 --> 11:25.947
I want to take a few minutes
to talk about something

11:25.980 --> 11:31.213
that is happening a mere
100 yards from this courthouse:

11:31.250 --> 11:33.115
Occupy Wall Street!

11:35.320 --> 11:38.983
Yes, these amazing young men
and women are braving

11:39.030 --> 11:40.019
36-degree weather,

11:40.060 --> 11:43.063
with the grit in their eyes
of a shared cause,

11:43.100 --> 11:45.466
and all to challenge the system.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.095
And I, for one, I...

11:49.140 --> 11:50.767
I salute them.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.000
Well, that's all right.
That's all I want to say.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.405
And with that,
we should get started, so...

12:06.990 --> 12:09.083
Do you want me to take
the first witness?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.849
No, I'm good.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.153
(people chanting in Arabic)

12:19.940 --> 12:20.998
WILL:
And that's you?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.530
Yes.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.868
And you and your sister
were in Syria why?

12:24.910 --> 12:26.059
We were studying Arabic

12:26.110 --> 12:28.032
at the Al-Baath University
in Homs.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.344
(chanting continues)

12:31.850 --> 12:33.112
(gunshots)

12:33.150 --> 12:34.515
(protesters screaming)

12:34.550 --> 12:36.313
(gunshots continue)

12:37.890 --> 12:39.039
And who is this?

12:39.090 --> 12:42.082
My sister... Sara.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.452
She told me to take the camera.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.526
She wanted the video to get out.

12:47.830 --> 12:50.060
(blow lands, people shouting)

12:52.530 --> 12:54.998
And then
what happened?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.359
(sniffles)

12:56.400 --> 12:59.130
The officers took us
into custody.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.104
Saydnaya Prison in Homs.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.199
And the al-Mukhabarat
al-'Askariwa...

13:03.250 --> 13:05.002
That's military intelligence?
Yes.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.211
They had a transcript
of a cell call

13:07.250 --> 13:08.877
I had with Sara a week earlier,

13:08.920 --> 13:10.012
and he kept repeating it.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.847
And that's why
you were arrested?

13:11.890 --> 13:14.154
Yes. We discussed joining
the protest on the call.

13:14.190 --> 13:17.125
Do you have any idea
how they intercepted this call?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.082
_ Yes._ There was a PC
in the interrogation room,

13:19.130 --> 13:20.995
and he kept reading it
from the screen.

13:21.030 --> 13:24.522
But what does that have
to do with Mr. Gross's company?

13:24.570 --> 13:26.094
Couldn't that have been
any software?

13:26.130 --> 13:28.394
No. When they took me
to my cell,

13:28.440 --> 13:30.032
I saw the logo on the screen.

13:30.070 --> 13:32.459
It was the chess piece logo
from Chumhum.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.831
_And that was the last
time you saw Sara alive?

13:34.880 --> 13:37.201
Yes. When the guards looked
through her passport,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.138
they saw a stamp for Israel.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.613
We had gone
a year before,

13:40.650 --> 13:42.515
but my stamp was
too faint to see,

13:42.550 --> 13:45.246
so they let me go,
and they kept her.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.281
You were demonstrating
peacefully, Jimmy?

13:47.320 --> 13:48.981
You and Sara?

13:49.020 --> 13:52.148
Yes.
Much like Occupy Wall Street...

13:52.190 --> 13:53.293
Oh, come on.

13:53.330 --> 13:54.888
Objection, Your Honor.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.296
Your Honor, I am merely showing
the victim's intentions.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.935
No, you're merely playing into
His Honor's stated sympathy.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.164
Okay, thank you, both of you.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.031
I think you'll find
that I'm made

14:03.070 --> 14:04.298
of sterner stuff,
Mr. Gardner, Ms...?

14:04.340 --> 14:06.160
Walsh.
Walsh,

14:06.210 --> 14:08.201
than to have my sympathies
so easily plucked.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.434
So, any further questions?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.573
No, Your Honor.

14:11.610 --> 14:14.317
Mr. Fellner, you know that
Chumhum has

14:14.350 --> 14:17.080
many software products
that use the same logo?
Yes.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.247
Business software,
word processors, spreadsheets,

14:19.290 --> 14:22.259
and all are designated to use
the same chess piece logo?

14:22.290 --> 14:25.123
Yes.
So couldn't it
have been one

14:25.160 --> 14:26.627
of Mr. Gross's other
sobeare products,

14:26.660 --> 14:29.128
say, his word processing
sobeare, for example, that you

14:29.160 --> 14:30.320
saw on the screen
that you mentioned?
No.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.258
But you aren't certain?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.666
All the software has different
colored chess pieces.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.565
This chess piece was red.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.966
WILL: Just so we're clear,
Your Honor, red is

14:39.010 --> 14:40.102
the color of the logo...

14:40.140 --> 14:42.438
Objection, Your Honor.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.075
Do we all get to testify
into the record now?

14:46.110 --> 14:47.145
Okay, we're going to be making
some changes around here,

14:47.180 --> 14:50.149
shuffling a few people around.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.441
Is this about
the failed grand jury?

14:51.490 --> 14:52.639
No, this is about
a lot of things,

14:52.690 --> 14:54.510
not just any one thing.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.289
Some of us weren't consulted on

14:56.320 --> 14:57.355
that judicial bribery
investigation.

14:57.390 --> 15:00.223
CARY: We're not gonna
finger-point around here.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.194
No one's to blame, and
everyone's to blame.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.528
So I will be visiting with you
each individually

15:04.570 --> 15:07.095
to discuss new priorities,
all right? Thank you very much.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.163
Too bad that didn't
work out for you.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.007
Go to hell.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.047
DIANE: I heard you did
well in court today.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.417
I did.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.089
And yet...

15:38.270 --> 15:42.491
The Attorney Compliance
and Disciplinary Board

15:42.540 --> 15:44.337
is pursuing
my disbarment.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.338
Uh... Why?

15:46.370 --> 15:48.338
The $45,000 I borrowed
15 years ago.

15:48.380 --> 15:52.248
No statute of limitations.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.976
My guess is Wendy slipped
the charges to them

15:55.020 --> 15:56.248
as a late hit.

15:56.280 --> 15:57.508
We have to fight it.

15:57.550 --> 15:58.517
Fight what?

15:58.550 --> 16:00.108
I did it.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.650
It was a long time ago,

16:01.690 --> 16:04.284
but I did it.
Yes. And we have to point out

16:04.330 --> 16:05.228
their hypocrisy in pursuing you.

16:05.260 --> 16:07.649
One thing I've noticed,
people in judgment

16:07.700 --> 16:10.419
don't care
about their hypocrisy.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.268
Then you throw yourself
at the mercy of the board.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.509
It never ends, does it?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.232
Once they have you
in their grasp...

16:23.180 --> 16:25.205
...they never let go.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.481
(elevator bell dings)

16:37.090 --> 16:38.523
Eli.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.096
Diane.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.391
Why are you doing it?

16:47.400 --> 16:50.198
_ Nora! _ _
There is someone in my office!

16:50.240 --> 16:51.559
Why are you undercutting
me with your wife?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.339
Ex-wife.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.076
You can't just come in here.
You call ahead.

16:56.110 --> 16:57.407
Well, you left one of your socks
last night.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.179
I needed to return it.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.417
I did not. That is not my sock.
What am I, Santa?

17:01.450 --> 17:03.509
Oh, it's mine.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.518
What's wrong with green? There's
nothing wrong with green.

17:05.550 --> 17:08.417
For trees and split
pea soup, nothing.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.711
But for campaign
brochures...

17:09.760 --> 17:13.321
This is not Campaign 101.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.657
Then stop undercutting me
with your wife.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.429
Then do a better job.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.792
Well, your ex-clients seem to
think I'm doing a better job.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.559
Okay. You got me there.
Good-bye.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.760
I need to see you again.

17:25.370 --> 17:26.632
No.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.399
Last night was amazing.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.101
I can_still tas_te
you this morning.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.347
Oh, okay.
Thank you. G... Good-bye.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.747
REPORTER:
At least 75 people
are reported dead in Syria

17:36.780 --> 17:39.817
in one of the bloodiest days
since the uprising began.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.683
The violence comes a day after
41 people were killed,

17:42.720 --> 17:44.426
including five women...

17:44.460 --> 17:47.327
Hi, remember me?
Stacie Hall.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.521
Yeah. How are you?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.597
Good. I have a
quick question.
Okay.

17:52.630 --> 17:56.066
How did you find out
she slept with bin Laden?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.837
Why don't we discuss this
somewhere else?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.873
Not that bin Laden.
Not Osama.

18:02.910 --> 18:04.798
(knock on door)

18:04.850 --> 18:06.169
Patric Edelstein
wants an update.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.370
The conference room.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.284
What?

18:10.320 --> 18:13.118
So we are doing this
for Edelstein?

18:14.390 --> 18:16.449
Conference room.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.249
The class rejected
the offer of a scholarship

18:22.300 --> 18:24.598
of $100,000
and a joint statement.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.166
And so now
we're at trial.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.428
And what are our chances?
Fifty-fifty.

18:27.470 --> 18:29.165
But our intent
is to use the trial

18:29.200 --> 18:30.337
to apply further pressure
to Neil Gross

18:30.370 --> 18:33.476
and get a more lucrative
settlement.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.876
So I have to ask something
of you.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.344
Okay.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.371
I need you to settle.

18:42.420 --> 18:45.844
We'd rather not have
Congress look into

18:45.890 --> 18:47.619
our foreign sales
of decryption software.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.254
I would imagine
that would work for you,

18:50.290 --> 18:51.382
having Congress look
into Neil Gross.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.295
No. Unfortunately,
on this point,

18:53.330 --> 18:56.652
Neil _Gross's interests and
my interests are aligned.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.328
Congress will turn
this into a circus.

18:59.370 --> 19:01.497
This trial is giving
it more prominence.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.758
We don't represent you
mmsmm.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.404
We represent the class,

19:06.440 --> 19:08.738
the three families
of the dead protesters.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.668
Yes, but I referred
them to you.

19:10.710 --> 19:12.439
I understand that.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.243
But when we agreed
to take their case,

19:14.280 --> 19:15.474
they became our clients,
not you.

19:15.520 --> 19:16.475
I'm sorry.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.283
This isn't...

19:20.360 --> 19:22.487
...really what I wanted.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.283
I'm sorry.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.458
We can't help you here.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.795
Are we going to be
all right here?

19:32.830 --> 19:35.367
I don't know.
He may leave.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.697
That's the breaks.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.501
Mr. Deerfield,
do you have a minute?

19:40.540 --> 19:42.337
Yes. Uh...

19:42.380 --> 19:43.779
Diane Lockhart, right?

19:43.810 --> 19:47.416
Yes. I'd |ike_to talk
to you about Will Gardner.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.712
My name is Kassim Al-Khoury.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.980
I'm a software wholesaler,
working out of Dubai.

19:55.020 --> 19:57.580
And you've had dealings
with Mr. Gross's company?

19:57.630 --> 19:59.427
Yes. We admire you

19:59.460 --> 20:00.996
greatly, Mr. Gross.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.622
I've read your
biography three times.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.491
And where did you have dealings
with Mr. Gross's company?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.794
In Dubai, at the yearly
technology trade show.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.889
The trade show colloquially
referred to as

20:08.940 --> 20:10.965
"The Wiretapper's Ball"?

20:11.010 --> 20:13.899
Yes. Various Western companies
sell their wares there.

20:13.940 --> 20:16.238
And many totalitarian
governments shop there

20:16.280 --> 20:19.499
for spy tech and
data-mining software?

20:19.550 --> 20:21.814
Yes. but also corporations
who want to encourage

20:21.850 --> 20:23.613
employee productivity.

20:23.650 --> 20:25.743
(Abernathy sniffles, sobs)
Also law enforcement...

20:28.420 --> 20:30.627
Oh, sorry.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.252
Please continue.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.951
We can take a break,
Your Honor.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.524
No, no, no, no.
No, it's nothing.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.596
Over lunch, I went to offer
moral support

20:37.630 --> 20:38.927
to Occupy Wall Street.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.892
And it's because
of the pepper spray.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.838
(clears throat)

20:45.870 --> 20:47.872
At the Wiretapper's Ball,

20:47.910 --> 20:51.539
you bought some of Mr. Gross's
CoursePoint software?

20:51.580 --> 20:52.478
Yes.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.341
And you sold it
to representatives of Syria?

20:54.380 --> 20:55.449
Yes.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.845
And this was because
Chumhum itself

20:56.880 --> 21:00.281
couldn't sell software
to the Syrians?

21:00.320 --> 21:02.788
Yes, the American trade embargo
required using a middleman.

21:02.820 --> 21:03.980
That is me.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.021
And this is, in fact,
your invoice,

21:06.060 --> 21:08.449
selling CoursePoint
to the Syrians?

21:08.500 --> 21:09.922
Yes, it is.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.428
And did Chumhum know you were
reselling sobeare to Syria?

21:12.470 --> 21:16.292
Oh, yes. I sent the
invoices to them as well.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.501
No further questions.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.407
(blowing nose)

21:21.440 --> 21:23.544
I, um, Ms. Walsh,

21:23.580 --> 21:25.070
do you have
any questions?

21:25.110 --> 21:26.543
Yes, Your Honor.

21:26.580 --> 21:29.777
You hold a grudge

21:29.820 --> 21:31.378
against Mr. Gross's firm,
don't you?

21:31.420 --> 21:32.512
No. What do you mean?

21:32.550 --> 21:34.689
I mean, that you sued Mr. Gross
for nonpayment of debt.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.848
No. We had a disagreement over
Euro-to-dollar conversions.

21:37.890 --> 21:41.553
Well, didn't Mr. Gross's company
refuse to pay you

21:41.600 --> 21:43.625
precisely because
you were selling

21:43.670 --> 21:45.820
spy software
to Middle Eastern regimes?

21:45.870 --> 21:47.599
No, that is not true.
(whispering)

21:49.400 --> 21:50.332
No further questions,
Your Honor,

21:50.370 --> 21:51.928
but we_would like to recall
Jimmy Fellner.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.701
Why are you suing,
Jimmy?

21:55.740 --> 21:57.799
Because my sister's dead,
and she doesn't have to be.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.078
(Abernathy sobbing)

21:59.110 --> 22:00.509
(sniffling)

22:00.550 --> 22:02.370
Sorry.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.479
Ignore me.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.557
And that's why everyone
in this class action

22:07.590 --> 22:09.319
is suing, right?
Yes.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.621
That's your sister?

22:11.660 --> 22:13.423
Yes.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.052
And who's this?

22:15.100 --> 22:16.658
It looks like my sister,

22:16.700 --> 22:18.429
but I've never seen
that photo before.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.665
But it would appear
to be your sister.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.793
Yes, where was it taken?
We just got this photo

22:22.840 --> 22:24.762
from a Syrian
rebellion Web site.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.107
It was taken three days ago.

22:26.140 --> 22:27.437
Objection, Your Honor.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.572
Why would you object?

22:28.610 --> 22:29.872
We've just given
your client good news.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.138
His sister is alive.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.579
WILL:
We have no way to confirm

22:32.610 --> 22:33.611
the providence of this.

22:33.650 --> 22:34.810
Oh, my God.
Jimmy,

22:34.850 --> 22:37.068
you yourself said
that you're suing

22:37.120 --> 22:39.111
because
your Sister is dead.

22:39.150 --> 22:42.483
Well, this is evidence
that she's alive.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.626
DEERFIELD:
Mr. Will Gardner,

22:48.660 --> 22:51.993
one of the objectives of
the State Bar Disciplinary Board

22:52.030 --> 22:54.692
is to maintain the honor
and integrity

22:54.740 --> 22:56.492
of the practice of the law

22:56.540 --> 22:59.907
and to promote the general
welfare of the members thereof.

22:59.940 --> 23:02.829
To this purpose, we have
collected sufﬁcient evidence

23:02.880 --> 23:06.839
regarding the theft of $45,000
we believe

23:06.880 --> 23:09.474
warrants dis_barment
proceedings.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.646
Do you understand?

23:10.690 --> 23:11.918
Yes.

23:11.950 --> 23:13.087
In all matters,

23:13.120 --> 23:15.509
this board attempts
to show deference

23:15.560 --> 23:17.482
to any calls for leniency.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.622
It has come to our attention

23:18.660 --> 23:21.720
that you have been responsible
for the establishment

23:21.760 --> 23:23.921
of the pro bono department
in your firm.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.598
At a time when most firms

23:26.630 --> 23:28.666
are curtailing their
pro bono efforts,

23:28.700 --> 23:30.964
it is heartening to see
that Lockhart & Gardner

23:31.010 --> 23:34.537
is stepping those efforts
up, at your direction.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.673
For this reason,

23:36.710 --> 23:39.941
we would like to offer you
the option of suspension.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.948
Six months probation.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.618
No cases, no clients,

23:43.650 --> 23:46.619
no entering a courtroom
except as a private citizen.

23:46.650 --> 23:49.915
And if I decline?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.985
Then we proceed
to a disbarment hearing.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.919
And the determination
of this panel

23:54.960 --> 23:57.827
will be permanent.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.622
(all talking at once)

23:59.670 --> 24:01.194
We have to;
we have to drop the suit.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.434
That's exactly what
the other side wants.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.700
JIMMY:
I don't want anything out there
that could jeopardize

24:04.740 --> 24:06.605
my sister's life.
WOMAN: You're being irrational.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.130
What if it were Amy?

24:08.180 --> 24:09.807
You'd still be thinking
about monetary damages?

24:09.840 --> 24:13.913
If we walk away, this company
goes about its business,

24:13.950 --> 24:16.646
and who's to say there's
not another Amy or Sara

24:16.680 --> 24:17.988
in the future?

24:18.020 --> 24:19.783
That's exactly right.
Which is why...

24:19.820 --> 24:22.118
(all talking at once)

24:25.630 --> 24:28.053
The majority of
the class rules.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.558
Yes, but we put Kalinda on
finding out more about Sara.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.897
Good, I'm on it.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.033
You talked to the board?

24:37.070 --> 24:38.833
What did they say?

24:38.870 --> 24:42.670
Six months suspension.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.200
How long do you have?

24:44.250 --> 24:46.070
They need a
decision tomorrow.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.249
Fight it, Will.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.548
Six months away from the law
will kill you.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.048
KALINDA:
The photo of Sara
was on the Web site

25:00.090 --> 25:02.149
of a blogger who goes
by Pink Damascus.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.998
A lesbian activist chronicling
the protests in Syria.

25:05.030 --> 25:07.225
She's been a huge thorn
in the side of the Assad regime.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.033
Can you find her?
If we know who took

25:09.070 --> 25:10.230
the picture,
we can find Sara.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.761
I have some ideas.

25:14.010 --> 25:16.103
Caitlin?

25:16.140 --> 25:19.075
Has Viola asked you
to join her firm?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.848
Yes.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.812
I said no.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.681
Yes, just so you know,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.154
other firms will try
to distract you

25:28.190 --> 25:29.657
by asking you
to join them.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.180
It means nothing.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.790
They never trust you
if they poach you.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.752
It's best to
stay loyal.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.119
_ I wasn't
taking it seriously.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.821
I know.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.223
Am I doing well here?

25:40.270 --> 25:41.760
You are.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.869
Very well.

25:42.900 --> 25:43.969
Good.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.331
Thank you.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.179
ELI:
This is first-rate

25:48.210 --> 25:49.871
idiocy!

25:49.910 --> 25:52.174
Is that why you brought us
in here, Eli, to insult me?

25:52.210 --> 25:54.144
You slept with a bin Laden;
you can't just ignore that.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.045
How do you know
we're ignoring it?
You grilled Kalinda

25:56.080 --> 25:57.149
on how she figured it out.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.317
You can't just close off
those channels.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.341
Hm, you're right, Vanessa.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.881
_ His left vein in
his temple pulsates

26:02.920 --> 26:05.150
when he gets angry.
It won't work.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.181
If Kalinda figured it out,
it's only a matter of time

26:07.230 --> 26:08.356
before it becomes public.
So,

26:08.400 --> 26:09.628
what's your suggestion?

26:11.800 --> 26:12.892
Own it.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.898
Be the one
to bring it forward.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.067
Cloak it in
open-mindedness.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.965
Pushing back against
anti-Islamic prejudices.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.102
It's only a name.

26:20.140 --> 26:22.233
Our president had
the same middle name

26:22.280 --> 26:24.669
as a genocidal dictator,
and we still elected him.

26:24.710 --> 26:28.919
This guy, your, um,
hotel financier,

26:28.950 --> 26:30.212
the one you slept with
while we were married...

26:30.250 --> 26:31.842
Eli. _
What? I'm being

26:31.890 --> 26:33.619
just as accurate
as the press will be.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.957
You know, this is getting
messy; maybe I should

26:34.990 --> 26:36.617
just back off.
No, Stacie, give us

26:36.660 --> 26:38.878
a minute.
Sure. Oh, there my sock is.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.788
(door closes)

26:44.830 --> 26:47.094
So, who are you obsessed with,
her or me?

26:47.130 --> 26:48.939
No one.

26:48.970 --> 26:51.029
I'm just helping.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.061
I don't like her hurting you.

26:53.110 --> 26:54.998
Okay, do me a favor.

26:55.040 --> 26:56.871
Either stop caring

26:56.910 --> 26:59.071
or officially get on board.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.913
So, Cary, how's it hanging?

27:05.950 --> 27:07.952
(chuckles)

27:11.360 --> 27:13.954
I need you to take
a step back from court

27:14.000 --> 27:16.889
_ and do some
child support enforcement.

27:16.930 --> 27:19.023
You need me to?

27:19.070 --> 27:21.231
Yeah.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.261
We were both

27:23.300 --> 27:25.302
on that judicial
bribery investigation.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.807
It wasn't just me.
This is what Peter needs.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.728
So it's Peter, not you.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.998
It's what the office needs.

27:36.020 --> 27:37.715
And you're just gonna
go along with it.

27:37.750 --> 27:38.785
Right?

27:38.820 --> 27:41.311
You knew I was following
Wendy Scott-Carr's orders,

27:41.360 --> 27:43.112
but you don't give a damn.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.923
Dana...
No.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.690
You don't get
to say it like that.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.789
No, Mr. Agos, you don't.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.024
It won't be very long...

27:51.070 --> 27:52.423
Good-bye.

27:52.470 --> 27:53.937
What does that mean?

27:56.270 --> 27:58.932
SAMIR:
Yes, I see the photo of Sara,

27:58.970 --> 28:00.232
but I cannot help.

28:00.270 --> 28:02.135
It could have been taken
anywhere in Syria.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.307
And what about the blog
where it surfaced?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.308
(man shouting)
Can you... can you help us
find Pink Damascus?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.848
Samir?

28:10.890 --> 28:13.211
Are you there?

28:13.250 --> 28:14.808
Samir?

28:16.890 --> 28:18.152
I cannot stay here long.

28:18.190 --> 28:19.953
I understand.

28:19.990 --> 28:20.957
Uh, yes, yes,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.922
we know this Web site.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.190
No one really knows
where this Pink Damascus is.

28:25.230 --> 28:28.097
If you learn a neighborhood,
I will keep trying.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.732
(man shouting)
I have to go.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.874
I can't help.

28:34.910 --> 28:36.434
That's not
technically true.
I thought I was getting

28:36.480 --> 28:39.301
and update from Will Gardner.
Pink Damascus has a
Sleuthway account, sir,

28:39.350 --> 28:41.215
and if we could
just contact her...

28:41.250 --> 28:42.979
Our privacy policy is
the cornerstone of my company.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.942
If it got out that I released
a user's confidential informa...

28:44.990 --> 28:47.515
Better than if it got out
that you prioritized

28:47.550 --> 28:49.757
company policy over the life
of a 23-year-old girl.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.257
(ringing)

28:57.830 --> 29:00.162
MAN:
Yeah?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.361
Can I help you?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.958
I'm sorry.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.432
I think I got the wrong person.

29:05.470 --> 29:07.358
Who did you think I was?

29:07.410 --> 29:10.004
A lesbian blogger from Syria.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.974
Pink Damascus?

29:12.010 --> 29:13.841
Sorry to disappoint.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.815
Have you heard of her?

29:16.850 --> 29:19.887
Yeah, you know,
I keep up with the news.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.115
Yeah, imagine the public uproar

29:22.160 --> 29:24.025
if it were revealed
that Pink Damascus is actually

29:24.060 --> 29:26.153
a 30-something-year-old guy
living in Kansas,

29:26.190 --> 29:28.522
pretending.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.960
Where'd you come up with Kansas?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.991
Your Rock Chalk pillow,
the KU cheer.

29:33.030 --> 29:33.860
You know,

29:33.900 --> 29:36.095
you could face
felony fraud charges.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.869
That's five to eight years
in federal prison.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.866
You're lying.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.798
I work for a law firm.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.376
Try me.

29:44.410 --> 29:46.139
What do you want?

29:47.850 --> 29:49.909
He only had an IP address

29:49.950 --> 29:51.178
for the person who
sent him the photo.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.414
"Hell?

29:52.450 --> 29:53.986
Yeah, imagine that.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.385
Misrepresenting himself
on the Internet.

29:55.420 --> 29:59.049
I traced the
IP address to Homs.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.194
An Internet cafe in
the Al-Sinaa district.

30:01.230 --> 30:04.097
Good, you'll pass this
on to your contact in Syria?

30:04.130 --> 30:05.529
Yeah.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.036
You _wanted to discuss
the Neil Gross questioning?

30:10.070 --> 30:11.560
Yeah.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.032
No.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.479
You...

30:15.510 --> 30:17.375
want me to...
No, stay.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.173
Close the door a second.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.994
I didn't tell you about the
grand jury investigation before,

30:35.030 --> 30:36.258
and that was a mistake.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.063
And you're safe.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.067
Yes.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.864
I mean, it's moved to
a possible disbarment,

30:41.900 --> 30:43.299
and I've been given a choice.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.898
Wait, what?

30:44.940 --> 30:46.999
The Disciplinary Board is
looking into disbarring me.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.132
Oh, my God.

30:48.180 --> 30:48.908
Will...
It's okay.

30:48.940 --> 30:51.977
It's just... I'm
used to it now.

30:52.010 --> 30:53.102
Funny.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.617
Anyway, I've been
given a choice.

30:54.650 --> 30:57.039
Fight disbarment or take

30:57.080 --> 30:59.116
a six-month suspension.
You can't; you don't deserve
to be disbarred.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.959
I do deserve to be disbarred.

31:00.990 --> 31:02.412
I took money from
a client's account.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.189
15 years ago.
But I did it.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.154
And you know what?

31:07.190 --> 31:09.351
The only reason I'm
being offered leniency

31:09.400 --> 31:11.391
is because of our...

31:13.070 --> 31:14.935
It's because of our
pro bono program.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.096
Something I fought

31:16.140 --> 31:17.664
tooth and nail.
You didn't.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.032
I did.

31:20.070 --> 31:23.073
I'm taking the
six month suspension.

31:23.110 --> 31:24.099
I did wrong.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.141
I should face
the consequences.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.415
There it is.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.111
I've just decided, thank you.

31:37.260 --> 31:39.228
You're giving up the law
for six months?

31:39.260 --> 31:40.989
Yeah.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.327
Weird, huh?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.362
I can't imagine it.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.265
You did for over a decade.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.160
Yes.

31:53.210 --> 31:56.270
Okay, I better tell someone.

31:58.610 --> 32:00.601
(door opens, closes)

32:08.120 --> 32:10.259
DIANE:
Okay, then you'll close out
the Neil Gross case,

32:10.290 --> 32:12.178
and I'll reassign your other
cases to the partners.

32:12.230 --> 32:13.629
How soon can you get me
a rundown?

32:13.660 --> 32:15.423
End of the day.
Good.

32:15.460 --> 32:16.620
You won't be able

32:16.660 --> 32:18.059
to come into the office

32:18.100 --> 32:19.988
unless_ it's related
to handing off cases

32:20.030 --> 32:21.691
or the business
of the firm.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.435
I'll file the papers
with the bar

32:23.470 --> 32:24.732
about the firm's
name change.

32:24.770 --> 32:26.738
Lockhart &_AssociateS
seems Simplest.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.931
Unless you have
any objections.

32:30.010 --> 32:31.705
So, we're done.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.342
For now.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.059
You'll still have a place
when you come back.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.191
Technology doesn't take sideS.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.095
Is that how you
rationalize doing business

32:52.130 --> 32:53.495
with autocratic regimes?
Objection.

32:53.530 --> 32:54.599
Argumentative.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.062
Yes, sustained.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.241
Mr. Gross,

33:09.280 --> 33:13.489
doeS your company sell to the
governments of Saudi Arabia

33:13.520 --> 33:14.612
and Bahrain?

33:14.660 --> 33:18.585
You mean, allies of the United
States with whom we have

33:18.630 --> 33:20.052
full diplomatic
and trade relations?

33:20.090 --> 33:21.022
Yes, we do.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.493
We_ never discussed this
line of questioning.

33:22.530 --> 33:24.020
Your social networking Web Site,
Chumhum--

33:24.070 --> 33:25.799
did you not turn over
the addresses

33:25.830 --> 33:27.593
of Chinese dissidents
to the Beijing...?

33:27.630 --> 33:28.733
Objection.
Relevance.

33:28.770 --> 33:31.034
Mr. Gross's lack of compunction
in dealing with regimes

33:31.070 --> 33:32.799
that_torture and kill
their own people,

33:32.840 --> 33:34.774
not to mention Amy Newton,

33:34.810 --> 33:36.368
Sara Fellner,
Mohammed Hazouri...

33:36.410 --> 33:38.048
Your Honor, I understand where
your sympathies lie...

33:38.080 --> 33:39.445
Ms. Walsh, stop that, please.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.176
I know you're trying
to drive a theme to help you

33:42.220 --> 33:44.381
in your appeal,
but don't do it at my expense.

33:44.420 --> 33:46.149
Your Honor, I wasn't.
You were, ma'am.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.487
And I don't mean to fly off
the handle here,

33:47.520 --> 33:48.782
but I am being objective.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.028
So, objection... sustained.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.690
Let's talk about CoursePoint,
Mr. Gross.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.721
It emits a ping
to your central servers

33:58.770 --> 34:00.089
when it's in use, does it not?

34:00.130 --> 34:01.131
Kind of a homing signal?

34:01.170 --> 34:03.195
Again, relevance.
If Mr. Gardner is so curious

34:03.240 --> 34:06.107
about the nutS and bolts
of our program,

34:06.140 --> 34:07.368
I recommend that he go

34:07.410 --> 34:10.072
to the software convention
in LaS Vegas next month.

34:10.110 --> 34:13.079
Regardless of how the program
waS obtained, Your Honor,

34:13.110 --> 34:14.441
how the program operates
is precisely

34:14.480 --> 34:15.515
what attracts
it to users.

34:15.550 --> 34:18.087
Your logic is... logical.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.145
Your objection is overruled,
Ms. Walsh.

34:20.190 --> 34:21.487
GROSS:
Uh, yes.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.657
When the software
is in use,

34:22.690 --> 34:24.282
it interfaces with
our server.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.480
So you are able
to identify when and where

34:26.530 --> 34:28.088
CoursePoint is active?

34:28.130 --> 34:29.256
Yes, we are.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.792
Well, then wouldn't it follow
that you had full knowledge

34:32.830 --> 34:34.639
that your product
waS being used

34:34.670 --> 34:35.864
by the Syrian
government?

34:35.900 --> 34:37.458
I've never denied that.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.435
But as I have maintained,
repeatedly,

34:40.470 --> 34:43.109
neither I nor my company
provided it to them.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.141
Can you tell if those pingS

34:52.190 --> 34:53.612
were being sent
from the city of HomS?

34:53.650 --> 34:54.753
Objection.
Beyond irrelevant.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.189
If you wanted to,

34:56.220 --> 34:57.881
Mr. Gross, you could tell where

34:57.920 --> 34:59.820
my client's Sister
waS being held right now.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.851
That doesn't
even make sense!
It does if she's being held

35:01.900 --> 35:04.721
in the same place Mr. Gross's
program is being used!

35:04.770 --> 35:06.863
Objection, Your Honor!
And I sustain

35:06.900 --> 35:08.458
Ms. Walsh'S objections.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.601
(low murmuring)

35:23.950 --> 35:25.884
Mostly good cross.

35:25.920 --> 35:26.841
Thank you.

35:26.890 --> 35:29.415
You tried to take
Neil Gross out at the knees.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.223
Only because no one else has.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.522
Be smart, Will.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.721
Don't argue from passion--
it cloudS your thinking.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.455
You think I've forgotten
about the case?

35:36.500 --> 35:38.388
That I'm suddenly hell-bent
on finding Sara?

35:38.430 --> 35:40.295
I think you're trying
to hit a home run

35:40.330 --> 35:41.399
with your last at bat.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.204
It's just an observation.

35:47.610 --> 35:50.306
I don't have much time
to prove anything.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.942
YeS.
Is that a yeS-yes,

35:53.980 --> 35:55.641
or an I-really-don't-want-to-

35:55.680 --> 35:57.272
but-my-ex-wife-haS-
worn-me-down yes?

35:57.320 --> 35:58.787
Does it make any difference?

35:58.820 --> 36:00.412
Yes, I will consult
on your campaign.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.214
And yes, I will even take my
marching orders from Stacie.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.387
Eli, I don't want you
if you don't want to.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.819
Okay, okay, okay, first
lesson about being

36:07.860 --> 36:09.327
an elected official: when
you get what you want...

36:09.360 --> 36:11.157
shut up!

36:14.400 --> 36:15.799
What?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.865
I miSS arguing with you.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.337
Well, I'm sure we'll now have
plenty of opportunities

36:22.380 --> 36:23.904
to_ relive those
glorious moments.

36:23.940 --> 36:24.872
I'll send over
the latest budget.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.878
You've always been good
about finding the fat.

36:26.910 --> 36:29.549
And I have some position papers
I'd like you to mark up.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.741
Mm-hmm. Well, you know
where to find me.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.685
Win or lose, this'll be nice.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.691
Diane, you needed something?

36:42.730 --> 36:44.266
Oh, yes.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.858
Will talked to you
about his decision?

36:45.900 --> 36:47.265
He did.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.961
_Go_od. _
I'm reaSSIgning hiS cases.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.265
I need you to take
thiS one solo.

36:52.310 --> 36:54.335
Will and I would like
to keep it under the radar.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.268
Who's the client?

36:56.310 --> 36:57.072
WILL:
Kalinda.

36:57.110 --> 36:59.340
_ DIANE:
It's primarily a tax case.

36:59.380 --> 37:02.838
Kalinda has a variety
of complications,

37:02.880 --> 37:03.949
some business, some personal.

37:03.980 --> 37:06.289
Several of which began
before She joined the firm.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.584
I appreciate
your confidence,

37:08.620 --> 37:11.521
but I would think a tax lawyer
might be more qualified.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.983
It's past what a tax lawyer
can do, which iS why

37:14.030 --> 37:16.555
I was handling it, and why
we want you to take over.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.420
You and Kalinda should talk
aS soon as pOSSlble.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.893
They are holding her
in an empty...

37:23.940 --> 37:24.964
Al-Sinaa district.

37:25.010 --> 37:29.606
Samir, you cut out.
Can you please repeat again?

37:29.640 --> 37:32.040
They are holding her in an empty
school in the Al-Sinaa district.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.445
They use these abandoned
buildings

37:33.480 --> 37:34.970
instead of prisons
to hold people.

37:35.020 --> 37:39.047
It makeS it a lot harder to find
someone you are looking for.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.842
And you're absolutely sure
she's there?

37:40.890 --> 37:43.017
As sure aS it is possible.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.324
I might be able
to get her out,

37:45.360 --> 37:47.385
but I will need
50,000 US. dollars.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.658
To pay a bribe?

37:50.330 --> 37:51.558
I will handle it, okay?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.036
But there's just
about four hours,

37:55.070 --> 37:56.731
so I need the money
immediately.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.567
We'll wire it.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.807
Samir, tell us where
to wire it.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.501
Okay, you want to wire it

38:03.540 --> 38:05.599
...central bank...
(static crackles)

38:05.650 --> 38:07.572
Did you get that?

38:07.610 --> 38:08.816
Samir?

38:08.850 --> 38:11.842
Hello?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.915
I know how we're going
mwmmmwm.

38:13.950 --> 38:14.985
How?

38:15.020 --> 38:17.352
Tech support.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.756
DineSh Rekhi.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.722
I work on the Chumhum help desk.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.761
But to my customers, I'm Roger.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.631
Have you received calls
from userS

38:28.670 --> 38:30.991
seeking help
with CoursePoint?

38:31.040 --> 38:34.009
YeS. It's a complex program,
and there's still

38:34.040 --> 38:36.531
a bug or two to be worked out.
Sorry, Mr. Gross,

38:36.580 --> 38:37.638
but all programs
have bugs.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.604
And how many calls have
you received since March 2011,

38:40.650 --> 38:41.947
when the Syrian
uprising began?

38:41.980 --> 38:43.015
Hundreds.

38:43.050 --> 38:45.041
Did any of those
calls come

38:45.090 --> 38:46.648
from customers in Syria?

38:46.690 --> 38:47.941
YeS.

38:47.990 --> 38:49.355
And who were those customers?

38:49.390 --> 38:50.152
Government users

38:50.190 --> 38:53.489
from the Ministry
of the Interior.

38:53.530 --> 38:54.428
The agency that oversees
Syrian security forces?

38:54.460 --> 38:56.451
I don't know.
I just answer the phoneS.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.821
How can you know
for certain who'S calling?

38:58.870 --> 39:01.862
Every user who calls must
identify their license number.

39:01.900 --> 39:04.403
It's part of the user agreement.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.931
_ WILL: _
So Syrian government agenCIeS
bought the software

39:06.970 --> 39:09.609
and registered it,
just like any other honest user?

39:09.640 --> 39:11.403
It appears so.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.940
But they couldn't use it
without your help.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.618
YeS.

39:14.650 --> 39:17.118
So, Chumhum iS helping
the Syrian government arrest

39:17.150 --> 39:18.515
and torture
protesters.

39:18.550 --> 39:19.778
Your Honor,
I'd like to request a recess

39:19.820 --> 39:22.118
_ to_ confer
With plaintiff counsel.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.924
ABERNATHY:
Harmony and concord
between the two sides.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.882
I'm inSpired.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.464
They have her.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.535
(static crackling)

39:42.680 --> 39:45.547
Sara?

39:45.580 --> 39:48.743
(static crackling)

39:48.780 --> 39:52.819
Greetings from Ramstein
Air Base.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.387
It's my first trip to Germany.

39:57.590 --> 39:58.727
(sniffles)

39:58.760 --> 40:00.557
You look like hell.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.828
You look perfect.

40:04.870 --> 40:08.636
(sobS, laughs)

40:16.480 --> 40:17.936
KALIN_DA:
Samir?

40:17.980 --> 40:20.141
Hello?

40:23.580 --> 40:24.786
Salaam alaikum.

40:24.820 --> 40:26.708
Is Samir available?

40:26.750 --> 40:29.651
No.

40:29.690 --> 40:30.952
He'S not here.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.794
I just wanted
to let him know that...

40:35.830 --> 40:37.923
I said he's not here.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.791
Do you know
when he might be back?

40:39.830 --> 40:42.663
Samir is gone.

40:44.570 --> 40:45.559
I-I'm sorry.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.838
We cannot talk anymore.

40:46.870 --> 40:49.532
Do not call again.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.488
REPORTER:
At least four people
have been killed

41:01.520 --> 41:03.954
after army troops stormed
the town of Talkalakh

41:03.990 --> 41:05.628
in western Syria.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.652
According to residents,
the town is under lockdown

41:08.700 --> 41:09.951
with government security...

41:10.000 --> 41:13.629
* And here to read the future

41:15.300 --> 41:20.806
* But forced
to breathe out the past *

41:23.680 --> 41:28.913
* And too many conversations

41:28.950 --> 41:35.219
* To uncover
what was purposefully lost *

41:36.320 --> 41:38.788
*Ah

41:42.630 --> 41:44.825
*Ah

41:46.700 --> 41:48.691
*Ah

41:51.810 --> 41:56.804
* Now we all look so desperate

41:57.810 --> 42:01.849
* Showing the guidance
that we lack *

42:05.620 --> 42:11.217
* And we used to be so wistful

42:11.260 --> 42:17.096
* I guess we feel it'S safer
holding back *

42:17.130 --> 42:20.293
* If I were to stay

42:20.330 --> 42:23.697
* Here between us...

42:23.740 --> 42:26.766
Burning the midnight 0”
even on your last day?

42:26.810 --> 42:30.075
I thought I could squeeze out
one last billable hour.

42:32.810 --> 42:34.107
Any idea what
you're gonna do?

42:34.150 --> 42:37.039
Maybe write a rock opera?

42:37.080 --> 42:39.947
There hasn't been a decent one
since The Wall.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.287
I'm sure it'll be great.

42:41.320 --> 42:44.756
I don't think Pink Floyd
has anything to worry about.

42:44.790 --> 42:46.121
(elevator bell dings)

42:46.160 --> 42:47.923
Will, if there's
anything you need...

42:47.960 --> 42:49.359
I'm good.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.789
But thankS.

42:58.940 --> 43:02.728
Follow Diane'S lead, Alicia.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.771
You'll do fine.
