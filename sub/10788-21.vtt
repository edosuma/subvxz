WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.125
YOU'RE STILL STUDYING?

00:04.125 --> 00:06.000
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
WELL, IT'S JUST...

00:07.000 --> 00:08.291
IT'S JUST THAT YOU

00:08.291 --> 00:10.166
HALF EXPECTED
TO SEE ME
LYING ON THE GROUND

00:10.166 --> 00:12.500
WITH A BEER BONG
DANGLING OUT OF
MY THROAT, RIGHT?

00:12.500 --> 00:14.375
WELL, FORGIVE THE MOMENTARY
LACK OF FAITH,

00:14.375 --> 00:16.332
BUT YOU WERE RECENTLY SEEN
ATTEMPTING FLIGHT.

00:16.332 --> 00:17.834
YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S NOTHIN'

00:17.834 --> 00:19.834
LIKE GETTIN' PULLED
OUT OF A SWIMMING POOL
FACE DOWN

00:19.834 --> 00:21.291
TO MAKE A GUY
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
CHANGING HIS WAYS.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.125
YEAH. YOUR RECENT EXPLOITS
AT SPRING BREAK

00:23.125 --> 00:26.000
DO QUALIFY YOU
FOR OFFICIAL ROCK BOTTOM.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.667
YEAH. WELL,
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO

00:27.667 --> 00:30.417
IS LEARN AN ENTIRE
SEMESTER OF ADVANCED
MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS

00:30.417 --> 00:33.750
IN THE NEXT 18 HOURS
SO THAT I CAN PASS
THIS EXAM,

00:33.750 --> 00:34.708
STAY IN SCHOOL,
AND HAVE BACK

00:34.708 --> 00:37.917
THAT ELUSIVE ENTITY
WE CALL "A LIFE."

00:37.917 --> 00:40.250
WELL, I'M GONNA BE
AT WORK ALL NIGHT,

00:40.250 --> 00:42.750
SO YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO STAY HERE AND STUDY
AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.458
NAH. THANKS,
BUT I THINK IT'S OK
TO GET BACK TO GRAM'S.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.291
SHE AND MR. SMALLS
HAVE TO BE DONE
PRACTICING CHOIR BY NOW.

00:49.291 --> 00:52.041
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
THAT THEY ASKED YOU TO LEAVE

00:52.041 --> 00:55.000
SO THAT THEY COULD
REHEARSE JESUS LOVES ME
IN PRIVATE, DO YOU?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.667
PLEASE, JUST DON'T TRY
AND TAKE THAT--THAT MYTH
AWAY FROM ME, ALL RIGHT?

00:59.667 --> 01:02.708
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT, UH, WE JUST DON'T
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.041
SEE YA.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.625
DOES BEING PROPOSITIONED
BY YOUR BOSS COUNT
AS ONE OF THOSE THINGS?

01:11.208 --> 01:14.125
YOUR  BOSS?

01:14.125 --> 01:16.750
BOSS THAT FIRED AUDREY?

01:16.750 --> 01:18.000
"BOSS THAT KISSED ME
DIRECTLY AFTER
I ASKED HER

01:18.000 --> 01:19.917
TO GIVE AUDREY
HER JOB BACK" BOSS.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.250
WELL, THAT'S
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.667
AND STRANGELY, I THINK

01:23.667 --> 01:25.583
THAT AUDREY
WOULD CONCENTRATE
MORE ON THE SEXUAL

01:25.583 --> 01:26.750
AND LESS ON
THE HARASSMENT.

01:26.750 --> 01:27.875
I SAY YOU
SHOULDN'T TELL HER.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.875
BUT FOR THE FACT
THAT HONESTY IS REALLY

01:29.875 --> 01:31.250
THE CORNERSTONE OF
A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP

01:31.250 --> 01:32.041
AND SHE KISSED
HER EX-BOYFRIEND

01:32.041 --> 01:33.083
AT SPRING BREAK
AND TOLD ME.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.375
WELL, ALL RIGHT,
BUT YOU WEREN'T

01:35.375 --> 01:37.083
FOOLIN' AROUND WITH
AN OLD FLAME HERE, OK?

01:37.083 --> 01:37.917
YOU GOT KISSED
AGAINST YOUR WILL.

01:37.917 --> 01:40.125
THIS IS TRUE.
ANY CHANCE

01:40.125 --> 01:41.583
THIS WOMAN'S GONNA
DEVELOP A CONSCIENCE

01:41.583 --> 01:42.583
AND OPEN UP TO AUDREY?

01:42.583 --> 01:43.917
NONE.
IS IT GONNA
HAPPEN AGAIN?

01:43.917 --> 01:44.667
NOT ON MY WATCH.
I DON'T SEE

01:44.667 --> 01:45.583
ANY REASON
TO TELL AUDREY.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.875
EXCEPT I'D FEEL
MUCH LESS GUILTY.

01:47.875 --> 01:48.959
WHY? YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.166
SHE'S HOT.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.750
RIGHT? COME ON, PACE.
FESS UP.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.792
SHE'S A TOTAL HOTTIE,
RIGHT?

01:57.792 --> 01:59.375
I REALLY DON'T SEE
HOW THAT'S RELEVANT, OK?

01:59.375 --> 02:00.458
I'M A VICTIM HERE.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.291
A VICTIM OF UNWANTED
SEXUAL ADVANCES.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.083
PACE.

02:04.083 --> 02:07.166
OK, PERHAPS NOT
ENTIRELY UNWANTED.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.542
SO HOW HOT IS SHE?

02:09.917 --> 02:11.291
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.458
HI. I'M ALEX.

02:15.458 --> 02:19.208
HI. I'M, UH,
I'M JAKE--UH, JACK.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.542
YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE IN TROUBLE.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.000
[LAUGHS]

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I'M REALLY
FLATTERED, ALEX,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.291
BUT DIDN'T ANYBODY EVER
TELL YOU THAT NO MEANS
NO?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.875
LOOK, PACEY,
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO...

03:29.875 --> 03:30.917
JUMP YOUR BONES.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.875
YOU DIDN'T?

03:32.875 --> 03:34.083
NO. I CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.375
I HOPE YOU ACCEPT THIS.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.041
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT COMING ONTO YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.000
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING
TO DO.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.875
WELL, SOMEHOW,
I'VE MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.375
YEAH, I JUST GOT OUT
OF A DOOMED RELATIONSHIP
BEFORE I MOVED HERE,

03:46.375 --> 03:48.959
AND I REALLY HAVEN'T
MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS YET,

03:48.959 --> 03:51.625
AND I WAS JUST FEELING
KIND OF LONELY.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.917
OBVIOUSLY, I COMPLETELY
MISJUDGED THAT SITUATION.

03:54.917 --> 03:57.250
SO I FEEL LIKE A FOOL.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.083
WELL, IT'S NOTHING WORTH
BEATING YOURSELF UP OVER.

03:59.083 --> 04:02.000
NO, IT'S JUST
SO EMBARRASSING.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.917
I MEAN, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHY I'M STILL SINGLE.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.917
WHY, 'CAUSE YOU
KISS THE HELP?

04:06.917 --> 04:10.333
NO. BECAUSE I TAKE GETTING
WHAT I WANT FOR GRANTED.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.000
LOOK, YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
I RESPECT THAT.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.583
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

04:14.583 --> 04:17.375
I'M HOPING THAT SHE'LL
COME BACK TO WORK WITH US.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.750
DO YOU THINK
THAT SHE MIGHT?

04:18.750 --> 04:19.834
YEAH, WELL, I CAN
CERTAINLY TALK TO HER.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.125
GREAT.

04:21.125 --> 04:24.083
AND LISTEN, NO MATTER

04:24.083 --> 04:26.750
HOW CUTE YOU ARE
IN YOUR UNIFORM,

04:26.750 --> 04:30.875
I PROMISE FROM NOW ON
COMPLETE PROFESSIONALISM.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.000
DEAL?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.250
YEAH, I THINK I CAN WORK
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.917
HEH.
HEH.

04:36.917 --> 04:37.542
WOW.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.917
THIS IS A REALLY NICE PLACE
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.750
I MEAN, I MUST BE SERIOUSLY
OVERPAYING YOU.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.625
NO, NO. IT'S BRECHER'S
OLD APARTMENT.

04:47.625 --> 04:48.792
I'M JUST SQUATTING HERE

04:48.792 --> 04:49.834
UNTIL THEY FIND A NEW TENANT
TO PICK UP HER LEASE.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.625
OH, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A PLACE.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.542
HEY, MAYBE I'LL GRAB IT

04:53.542 --> 04:56.083
AND LET YOU LIVE HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
RENT-FREE.

04:56.083 --> 04:56.500
WE COULD
WORK SOMETHIN' OUT.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.917
WORK SOMETHING OUT?

05:00.917 --> 05:02.291
OH, LIGHTEN UP, PACEY.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.458
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
THE APARTMENT.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.875
OF COURSE.

05:30.375 --> 05:31.542
[WHISPERING] Oh, sorry.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.291
[LAUGHING]

05:46.959 --> 05:48.125
YOU'RE LAUGHING AGAIN.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.417
OH, SORRY.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.500
SORRY.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.417
IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE

05:53.417 --> 05:56.834
THAT THE SAME GUY
WHO GAVE US SPINAL TAP
GAVE US THE STORY OF US.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.583
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
I HAVE TO SPEND MY ENTIRE NIGHT

05:59.583 --> 06:01.583
PREPARING FOR FINALS TOMORROW
WHILE YOU GET TO WATCH MOVIES.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.917
I HAVE FINALS.
I'M UNDER PRESSURE.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.667
I'VE GOT 5 MOVIES
TO GET THROUGH.

06:05.667 --> 06:09.125
SOUNDS A LOT BETTER
THAN A MACROECONOMIC TEXTBOOK
IN MEDIEVAL LITERATURE.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.500
ONE OF THE MOVIES I HAVE
TO SEE IS PLAYING IN TOWN.
YOU WANNA TAKE A BREAK?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.792
OH, I CAN'T, DAWSON.
I HAVE MAJOR CATCH-UP
TO DO TONIGHT.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.375
SEE, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU GET YOURSELF
A LIFE.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.834
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
GETTING STRAIGHT As,

06:18.834 --> 06:20.375
AND THEN THERE WAS
THIS SINGING INCIDENT
IN A BAR,

06:20.375 --> 06:23.917
AND NOW HERE I AM,
SEVERAL CHAPTERS BEHIND
IN MY READING ASSIGNMENT.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.291
YOU'RE NOT HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT
THIS NEW LIFE, ARE YOU?

06:26.291 --> 06:27.375
YEAH. I'M NEVER GOING
TO TAKE A CLASS AGAIN

06:27.375 --> 06:29.000
WHERE THEY MAKE YOU
READ BEOWULF.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.917
RIGHT.

06:31.917 --> 06:33.792
DAWSON...

06:35.583 --> 06:37.667
WHILE I'M GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR COMPANY

06:37.667 --> 06:39.417
AND REALLY GLAD THAT YOU
WANTED TO HANG OUT WITH ME
AND STUDY FOR FINALS,

06:39.417 --> 06:41.834
DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD DO IT QUIETLY?

06:41.834 --> 06:42.792
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.708
HA HA HA!

06:55.125 --> 06:57.291
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
CATCH THAT MOVIE NOW.

06:58.250 --> 06:58.667
GOOD IDEA.

07:02.708 --> 07:06.041
I'M PULLING OUT
THE BIG GUNS TONIGHT, JACK.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.333
GINGKO BILOBA.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.917
STIMULATES THE MEMORY,

07:10.917 --> 07:12.583
IMPROVES MENTAL ACUITY.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.417
I'M GONNA NEED A LOT
MORE THAN HERBAL TEA
TO LEARN THIS STUFF.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.417
WELL, NATURAL GINKGOLIDES
AND FAITH--

07:18.417 --> 07:20.083
A POWERFUL COMBINATION.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.750
SORRY, GRAMS,
BUT I AM WAY BEYOND

07:22.750 --> 07:24.417
BLIND, CAN-DO ENTHUSIASM
AT THIS POINT.

07:24.417 --> 07:28.917
I'M NOW DEEP INTO FEAR
AND PANIC.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.458
NOW, YOU'VE MANAGED

07:30.458 --> 07:34.375
TO ADEQUATELY
PREPARE FOR ALL YOUR
OTHER EXAMINATIONS.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.750
I'M QUITE CERTAIN
YOU CAN DO THE SAME
FOR THIS ONE.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.625
I COULD FUDGE MY WAY THROUGH
THE ENGLISH LIT ESSAYS.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.125
INTRO TO ARCHEOLOGY
IS MULTIPLE-CHOICE.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.500
BUT THIS STUFF, I MEAN,
MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.834
YOU EITHER KNOW IT OR YOU DON'T,
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T KNOW IT.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.458
WELL, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
ENLIST SOME HELP FROM
ONE OF YOUR CLASSMATES.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.792
HEH. PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF MY CLASSMATES

07:52.792 --> 07:54.875
BECAUSE PERHAPS
I HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TO CLASS.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.667
PERHAPS THAT'S WHY I DON'T
EVEN HAVE THE NOTES I NEED
TO UNDERSTAND THE TEXTBOOKS.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.125
OH, DEAR BOY.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.875
I KNOW IT SEEMS
ALL HOPE IS LOST,

08:01.875 --> 08:02.458
BUT REMEMBER--

08:02.458 --> 08:04.625
I LOVE YOU, GRAMS,

08:04.625 --> 08:06.500
BUT PLEASE DON'T LAUNCH
INTO A SPEECH

08:06.500 --> 08:08.792
ABOUT DANIEL IN
THE LION'S DEN RIGHT NOW.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.041
A LITTLE
DAVID AND GOLIATH?

08:10.041 --> 08:11.166
MM-MMM.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.333
NEED SOME
NEW MATERIAL, EH?

08:13.333 --> 08:15.041
YEAH, YOU DO.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.125
MM.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.625
CAN I HAVE THE GINKY,
PLEASE?

08:18.625 --> 08:21.417
TO HELL WITH HERBAL TEA.
YOU NEED COFFEE,
AND A LOT OF IT.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.959
NOW HIT THOSE BOOKS.

08:22.959 --> 08:25.417
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH THIS.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.291
OF ALL
THE MOVIE JOINTS
IN ALL THE TOWNS

08:37.291 --> 08:39.457
IN ALL THE WORLD...

08:39.457 --> 08:42.250
SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE
IS 14 YEARS OLD.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.667
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE
FOR YOUR REVIEW.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.917
I'M NOT HERE FOR WORK.

08:44.917 --> 08:47.000
PLEASURE?
NO, A DATE.

08:47.000 --> 08:47.500
NOT ONE AND THE SAME?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.166
NOT SO MUCH.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.834
WHERE IS HE?

08:50.834 --> 08:53.792
PROBABLY STILL
IN STORYTELLING  WITH
THE REST OF THE FREAKS.

08:53.792 --> 08:55.625
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE HE COMES OUT.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.291
YOU SEEN IT?

09:00.291 --> 09:02.000
STORYTELLING?
NO INTEREST.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.875
SO, YOU JUST WENT
AND SAW A DIFFERENT
MOVIE?

09:04.875 --> 09:05.917
I LEFT HIM IN THERE,
ACTUALLY.

09:05.917 --> 09:07.875
WHY?

09:07.875 --> 09:10.000
WHAT KIND OF A MAN
SUCKS A JORDAN ALMOND?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.125
HA HA.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.208
YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU WALKED OUT ON A DATE

09:14.208 --> 09:16.375
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE WAY THE GUY ATE
HIS CANDY?

09:16.375 --> 09:17.750
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
THE NOISE HE WAS MAKING.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.291
OH, AND WHEN WE PARKED,
CAR COVER.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.458
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU
YOU'RE A VERY CRITICAL
PERSON?

09:22.458 --> 09:24.583
THANK YOU.
WE ALL HAVE OUR GIFTS,

09:24.583 --> 09:27.625
AND SOME OF US HAVE
FIGURED OUT HOW TO SCAM
A LIVING OUT OF 'EM.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.542
I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF
HOW YOU MAKE A LIVING.

09:29.542 --> 09:30.708
LET'S SEE, HOW WAS IT?

09:30.708 --> 09:32.583
"DESPITE A TRULY
INSPIRED ENDING

09:32.583 --> 09:34.583
"WHICH SHOULD GARNER HIM
SOME ATTENTION,

09:34.583 --> 09:36.166
"MR. LEERY'S
FIRST EFFORT

09:36.166 --> 09:39.333
"IS AT TIMES IMITATIVE,
DERIVATIVE,

09:39.333 --> 09:41.166
AND FULL OF UNEXPLORED
POTENTIAL."

09:41.166 --> 09:44.583
THAT'S NOT A SLAM.
HEY, YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME
TO GO EASY ON YOU

09:44.583 --> 09:46.041
JUST BECAUSE WE KISSED,
DID YOU?

09:46.041 --> 09:47.291
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
CRITIQUE THE KISS.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.333
WHO SAYS I DIDN'T?

09:49.333 --> 09:50.583
[CHUCKLES]

09:50.583 --> 09:53.917
I LIKE YOUR WORK, DAWSON,
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.708
SO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
TESTED THE DATING WATERS
OF INSANITY?

09:56.708 --> 09:59.750
NO. NO, I'M JUST HERE
STUDYING FOR FINALS,

09:59.750 --> 10:02.083
DOING RESEARCH
FOR A PAPER ON
FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.708
SMART BOY.

10:03.708 --> 10:06.458
HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE
ONE OF MY FAVORITE FILMS
BY A NEW DIRECTOR?

10:06.458 --> 10:07.375
NOW?

10:07.375 --> 10:08.583
SURE. IT'S TOO EARLY
TO GO TO BED.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.750
WE COULD GO BACK
TO MY PLACE.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.291
HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT
A JORDAN ALMOND-SUCKER?

10:13.291 --> 10:15.291
OH, I KNOW.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.375
ANYWAY, ALL I KEEP
IN MY HOUSE ARE JUNIOR MINTS.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.417
IN THE FREEZER?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.625
WHERE ELSE?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.875
SO SHE WANTS ME
TO COME BACK?

10:23.875 --> 10:26.417
I TOLD YOU
I'D GET YOU YOUR JOB BACK.
CAN I DELIVER OR WHAT?

10:26.417 --> 10:27.875
SHE JUST
CHANGED HER MIND?

10:27.875 --> 10:29.834
ALEX CAME TO ME
THIS AFTERNOON AND TOLD ME

10:29.834 --> 10:31.917
TO TELL YOU THAT
YOU HAVE YOUR JOB BACK.

10:31.917 --> 10:33.959
SO, YOU SEE?
SHE'S NOT THE WENCH
THAT YOU THINK SHE IS.

10:33.959 --> 10:35.959
OH, PFFT, I KNOW EXACTLY
WHO SHE IS, AND SHE
KNOWS EXACTLY WHO I AM.

10:35.959 --> 10:39.333
BELIEVE ME,
WOMEN SPEAK A SHORTHAND
WITH EACH OTHER.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.208
WELL, NOT TO KNOCK
THE ESTROGENIC MORSE CODE,

10:41.208 --> 10:43.458
BUT I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE
MISJUDGED HER A LITTLE BIT.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.667
OH, HAVE I? AND WHAT
REASON DID SHE GIVE

10:45.667 --> 10:47.166
FOR SUDDENLY
CHANGING HER MIND?

10:47.166 --> 10:49.417
LOOK, DOES IT
REALLY MATTER?
HUMOR ME.

10:49.417 --> 10:50.667
BECAUSE SHE WAS
BEING NICE.
WHY?

10:50.667 --> 10:54.125
BECAUSE SHE'S
A NICE PERSON.
BULL.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.959
AND BECAUSE
I ASKED HER, OK?

10:56.959 --> 11:00.125
OH, OK. SO SHE WAS
BEING NICE TO YOU.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.125
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU GOT YOUR JOB BACK.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.458
SO, IF YOU COULD JUST
GO PUT ON YOUR UNIFORM,

11:03.458 --> 11:06.625
THEN WE CAN RESUME
OUR USUAL INAPPROPRIATE
WORK BANTER, OK?

11:06.625 --> 11:08.667
I THINK SHE WANTS YOU.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.667
COME ON.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.250
I HAVE SEEN THE WAY
THAT SHE LOOKS AT YOU.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.333
THIS WOMAN
WOULD ONLY BE NICE
IF IT SERVED HER.

11:13.333 --> 11:16.500
ALEX TOLD ME
THAT SHE REALIZED WHAT
A WONDERFUL WAITRESS YOU ARE

11:16.500 --> 11:18.834
AND SHE JUST DIDN'T
WANT THE RESTAURANT
TO LOSE YOU, OK?

11:18.834 --> 11:21.333
HAS SHE HIT ON YOU?
NO.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.834
I AM
A TERRIBLE WAITRESS,
AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

11:23.834 --> 11:25.834
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU'VE BEEN GETTING
MUCH BETTER LATELY.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.708
OH, PLEASE. I WOULD'VE
BEEN OUT OF HERE ON DAY ONE
IF IT WASN'T FOR MY BOOBS.

11:28.708 --> 11:29.875
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT
LIKE THAT--

11:29.875 --> 11:31.166
WHOA, WHOA.
DID SHE HIT ON YOU?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.041
NO, AND NOW YOU'RE
BEING KIND OF RIDICULOUS.

11:33.041 --> 11:33.959
YOUR PULSE JUMPED.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.417
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MAKING ME NERVOUS.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.083
YOUR PULSE IS RACING.
YOU ARE AFRAID
OF SOMETHING.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.917
YOU HAVE YOUR FINGERS
TO MY JUGULAR!
I'M AFRAID OF DYING!

11:39.917 --> 11:41.834
LOOK, I'M WILLING
TO BEND THE RULES

11:41.834 --> 11:43.250
ON INTER-OFFICE
RELATIONSHIPS,

11:43.250 --> 11:45.333
BUT COULD YOU PLEASE TRY
TO KEEP IT PRIVATE?

11:45.333 --> 11:47.834
YES, I THINK WE CAN
PROBABLY DO THAT,
RIGHT, HONEY?

11:47.834 --> 11:49.208
SURE.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.041
WELL, I'M SO GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK, AUDREY.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.375
REALLY, YOU'RE A VITAL PART
OF OUR SERVING TEAM.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.417
THANKS.

11:54.417 --> 11:55.083
[SNAPS FINGERS]

11:55.083 --> 11:57.125
YOU SEE?
COMPLETELY.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.250
HAVING ME BACK
IS THE LAST THING
THAT WOMAN WANTS.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.083
THEN WHY WOULD SHE SAY IT?!

12:01.083 --> 12:03.542
'CAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT
THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL
THAT I EVER WOULD.

12:03.542 --> 12:06.000
OH. WHAT IS IT
THAT I'M MISSING HERE?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.166
EVERYTHING!

12:07.166 --> 12:09.583
GOD, I AM QUITTING!

12:11.417 --> 12:13.625
I LIKE YOUR PLACE.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.834
IT'S VERY BRIDGET-JONES-
MEETS-FILM-GEEK.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.500
SOME GIRLS
COLLECT SHOES.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.417
I PRETTY MUCH
KEEP AMAZON IN BUSINESS.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.417
BEEN THAT WAY
SINCE I WAS A KID.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.834
OH, NOW HERE
IS A TRULY GREAT FILM.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.708
TRAFFIC?
YEAH, YEAH.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.166
HEY, SODERBERGH
FINALLY FOUND HIS VOICE.

12:28.166 --> 12:31.750
YOU PREFER
A LONG, SELF-IMPORTANT
HOLLYWOOD MOVIE

12:31.750 --> 12:33.291
OVER A UNIQUE
INDEPENDENT FIRST FILM?

12:33.291 --> 12:36.417
SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE
IS BASICALLY JUST A THROWBACK

12:36.417 --> 12:39.125
TO ALL THOSE
WONDERFUL OLD CLASSICS
WHERE ALL PEOPLE DO IS TALK,

12:39.125 --> 12:41.542
AND WHENEVER
ANYTHING TAKES PLACE
THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE,

12:41.542 --> 12:43.125
HE HAS THE CAMERA CUT AWAY.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.583
IT TAKES A WHILE FOR
YOUNG FILMMAKERS TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.583
[LAUGHS] THAT'S A PRETTY
BROAD GENERALIZATION.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.417
NAME A TRULY ORIGINAL MOVIE
BY A FIRST-TIME DIRECTOR.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.125
RESERVOIR DOGS,
LES MISTONS,

12:53.125 --> 12:55.625
STRICTLY BALLROOM,
DINER, MALTESE FALCON,

12:55.625 --> 12:57.625
BODY HEAT, CLERKS,
ORDINARY PEOPLE,

12:57.625 --> 12:59.458
SAY ANYTHING.  WHAT?

12:59.458 --> 13:01.166
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
YOU.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.166
I'VE BEEN
PRETTY ENGULFED
IN MY STUDIES LATELY.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.166
DON'T TELL ME.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.500
THE THESIS
FOR YOUR FINAL PAPER:

13:07.500 --> 13:08.834
"SODERBERGH'S FIRST FILM
SHOWS US

13:08.834 --> 13:12.250
"HOW SUBTLY PROVOCATIVE
THE MOVIES CAN BE,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.750
THAT JUST TALK
CAN BE AN EROGENOUS ZONE."

13:14.750 --> 13:16.500
YOU DON'T AGREE?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.917
I SUPPOSE IT DEPENDS
WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.959
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA WATCH A MOVIE.

13:26.959 --> 13:29.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
CHANGE OF PLAN.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.625
WOW.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.959
THAT HAPPENED.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.458
YEAH, IT DID.

13:44.959 --> 13:47.834
I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.
HMM?

13:47.834 --> 13:51.417
THIS WHOLE BUSINESS OF
PEOPLE ASKING EACH OTHER
HOW IT WAS AFTERWARDS

13:51.417 --> 13:52.875
COMES FROM MOVIES.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.166
SURE, IT'S
AN EXPOSITIONAL DEVICE

13:55.166 --> 13:56.000
NEEDED BECAUSE
OF THE CUTAWAY.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.500
THERE'S NO CUTAWAY
IN REAL LIFE.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.000
NO AUDIENCE TO SPOON-FEED
SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T
ALLOWED TO SEE.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.166
I LIKE THAT.

14:04.625 --> 14:05.959
ME, TOO.

14:20.625 --> 14:21.500
GIVE ME THAT.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.000
HEH. YOU WERE
A FILMMAKING MAJOR?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
YEAH, AMAZING,
ISN'T IT?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
I TOTALLY HAD YOU PEGGED

14:26.000 --> 14:27.458
AS A CRITICAL STUDIES
MAJOR.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.542
WELL, YOU LEARN
SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY.
NOW GIVE ME THE TAPE.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.458
NO, WE'RE POPPIN'
THIS IN THE VCR.
NO, NO.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.792
COME ON. I SHOWED YOU
MINE, AND I SHOULD
GET TO SEE YOURS.

14:32.792 --> 14:36.667
NO WAY. DAWSON,
I'M SERIOUS.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.083
I CAN SEE THAT.
[SIGHS]

14:52.792 --> 14:53.875

14:53.875 --> 14:56.250

IN SUMMER SCHOOL.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.750
BUT YOU ARE MY ROOMMATE,

14:59.750 --> 15:02.792
AND I AM LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO BE HERE FOR YOU, SO...

15:02.792 --> 15:03.917
DO TELL.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.458
IN PRECISELY WHAT WAY
DOTH A MALE SUCKAGE OCCUR?

15:06.458 --> 15:07.708
WHAT?

15:07.708 --> 15:09.834
BEOWULF  OVERDOSE.

15:09.834 --> 15:12.333
I THINK HE COULD
BE CHEATING ON ME.
WHO?

15:12.333 --> 15:15.875
CARLOS,
THE DORM SECURITY GUARD.
WHO DO YOU THINK? PACEY.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.750
[LAUGHS]
PACEY DOESN'T CHEAT.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.875
OH, YEAH? GET THIS.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.291
SO HE ASKS
MRS. ROBINSON

15:22.291 --> 15:24.708
TO GIVE ME
MY JOB BACK,
AND SHE AGREES.

15:24.708 --> 15:27.667
AND FROM THAT YOU DEDUCE
THAT HE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH HER?

15:27.667 --> 15:28.834
SHE'S THE AFFAIR TYPE.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.375
THOSE DONNA KARAN
BUSINESS SUITS
DON'T FOOL ME.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.208
SHE IS A FEMME FATALE
WITH AN MBA IN HOW
TO TAKE YOUR MAN AWAY.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.708
AUDREY, IF SHE WANTS
YOUR BOYFRIEND,

15:35.708 --> 15:36.708
WHY WOULD SHE OFFER
TO KEEP YOU AROUND?

15:36.708 --> 15:40.291
TO KEEP HIM HAPPY.
TO KEEP HIM OFF-GUARD.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.041
IT'S ALL PART OF
HER CRAFTY LITTLE PLAN.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.917
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE EXPRESSION, "KEEP
YOUR ENEMIES CLOSE"?

15:43.917 --> 15:45.959
HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD THE EXPRESSION,
"YOU NEED TO BE MEDICATED"?

15:45.959 --> 15:47.625
HE IS COVERING
SOMETHING, JOEY.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.041
I KNOW HE IS, OK?
I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT,

15:49.041 --> 15:51.375
BUT I CAN TELL
FROM HIS BEHAVIOR

15:51.375 --> 15:52.625
THAT HE'S KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM ME.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.041
MAYBE IT'S A FAMILY THING,

15:54.041 --> 15:57.041
OR MAYBE HE'S HAVING
A PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE
HE'S SUPERVISING.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.625
NOT EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT YOU, AUDREY.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.291
WELL,
MOST EVERYTHING IS.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.041
OK, UM,

16:05.041 --> 16:07.708
WELL, MAYBE HE'S
PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR YOU,

16:17.417 --> 16:20.625
MAYBE HE'S JUST
PLANNING A SURPRISE
OR SOMETHING.

16:20.625 --> 16:21.875
THERE YOU GO.

COMING UP SOON, RIGHT?

16:30.208 --> 16:31.333

TO ANNOY YOU.

WELL, IT'S GETTIN'
KIND OF LATE, YOU KNOW?

16:58.834 --> 17:01.041
OH. I HAVE TO GET
ALL THIS WORK FINISHED

17:01.041 --> 17:02.125
AND SENT OFF

IF YOU WANT TO BE HERE,

17:10.500 --> 17:12.165
THERE'S A TON OF STUFF
I COULD DO IN THE KITCHEN.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.875
OH, NO, NO. GO HOME.
GO BE WITH YOUR AUDREY.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.458

YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT?

17:16.458 --> 17:17.791
I'M A BIG GIRL, PACEY.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.666

17:19.666 --> 17:22.666
HEH HEH. I'M STAYING
IN A LITTLE PLACE
AROUND THE CORNER.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.250
WHEN I'M FINISHED,
I'M JUST GONNA
WALK THERE.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.208
YEAH, I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE
A REAL HIP, ARTSY NEIGHBORHOOD
DURING THE DAY,

17:28.208 --> 17:30.583
BUT IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING AT NIGHT,
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.792
UM, I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.875
US GIRLS
ARE STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.083

WHAT MY FRIEND JOEY SAID

17:38.083 --> 17:41.583
RIGHT BEFORE SHE MET UP
WITH A 9-MILLIMETER

THESE BOOKS.

RIGHT NOW BECAUSE
I'LL CARRY THEM FOR YOU.

17:47.208 --> 17:48.208

OH, YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT ALL THE GIRLS SAY

17:52.542 --> 17:54.208
RIGHT BEFORE
THEY SEE MY SOCKS.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.708
HEH. HA HA.

17:55.708 --> 18:00.041
MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED
IS A GIRL WHO KNOWS
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

18:00.041 --> 18:03.959
AND MAYBE YOU JUST
NEED TO LET A GUY
WALK YOU HOME.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.625

YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT, JACK.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.083
COME ON, BLOSSOM.
I KNOW SIGMA
HAS A WHOLE FILE

18:54.083 --> 18:56.875

OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

18:59.125 --> 19:01.500
HAS ANYONE HERE EVER HEARD
OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.125
MUST BE JUST A RUMOR.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.875
ANYWAYS, IF SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WERE TO EXIST,

19:05.875 --> 19:09.625
OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE
COMPLETELY OFF LIMITS
TO, UH, NON-BROTHERS.

OUR DIFFERENCES,

REALLY NOTHING THE BROTHERHOOD
CAN DO FOR YOU.

TO BE A JERK BECAUSE
IT'S IN YOUR NATURE, FINE,

ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

ABOUT YOUR MOVIE THAT
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE?

20:16.917 --> 20:21.500
IT'S JUST TOO PERSONAL.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.959

IN THIS AREA IS LIMITED,

YEAH, NOT
IN A COMMON WAY.

IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
MASTERWORK OF STINKAGE.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.291
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING
WE CAN EVEN TOLERATE

20:46.291 --> 20:47.583
BEING IN
THE SAME ROOM WITH
THE VIDEOTAPE OF IT.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.667

A LITTLE HARD ON YOURSELF?

20:49.667 --> 20:50.875
OH, NO.

20:50.875 --> 20:51.875
'CAUSE I'VE READ
YOUR REVIEWS.

20:52.917 --> 20:56.500
I WASN'T ALONE IN
MY PARTICULAR OPINION.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.083
SO, WHAT, YOU JUST NEVER
WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE?

20:58.083 --> 21:00.500
DAWSON, I LOVE MOVIES.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.708
I STARTED FAKING SICK
IN THE THIRD GRADE

21:01.708 --> 21:04.041
JUST SO THAT
I COULD STAY HOME
AND WATCH THEM...

21:04.041 --> 21:04.959
I STARTED IN THE FIFTH.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.291
AND NOW I'M A GROWNUP
WHO GETS PAID

21:06.291 --> 21:07.625
TO WATCH THEM
ALL DAY LONG.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.166
THAT SOUNDS GREAT,

21:09.166 --> 21:11.125
BUT YOU NEVER
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.542
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER WANTED
TO MAKE ANOTHER FILM?

21:13.542 --> 21:15.291
THE FIRST ONE
WAS SUCH A DISASTER.

21:15.291 --> 21:16.667
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO IT AGAIN?

21:16.667 --> 21:19.875
A VERY ATTRACTIVE GIRL
ONCE TOLD ME
THAT IT TAKES A WHILE

21:19.875 --> 21:22.125
FOR YOUNG FILMMAKERS
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY WANNA SAY.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.083
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
QUIT MY JOB

21:24.083 --> 21:26.041
AND USE MY CREDIT CARDS
TO FINANCE A MOVIE NOW?

21:26.041 --> 21:27.875
YOU WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST.

21:27.875 --> 21:32.083
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE
THE SAME RAW TALENT
THAT YOU HAVE, DAWSON.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.792
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.500
FILMMAKING WAS
SOMETHING I LOVED,

21:36.500 --> 21:37.750
BUT I WAS
GIVEN A CHANCE
TO DO THIS JOB,

21:37.750 --> 21:40.125
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT I'M PRETTY
DAMN GREAT AT IT,

21:40.125 --> 21:41.291
AND THAT
MAKES ME HAPPY.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.667
SO I LEFT
FILMMAKING BEHIND,

21:42.667 --> 21:43.417
AND I MOVED ON
WITH MY LIFE.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.291
SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE
TO LET THINGS GO LIKE THAT.

21:49.291 --> 21:55.208
IT SOUNDS VERY SMART
AND PRACTICAL.

21:55.208 --> 21:57.250

CONSIDER TAKING OVER
