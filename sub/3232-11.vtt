00:33.573 --> 00:35.032
What's up?
-How's it going?

00:40.455 --> 00:41.456
All right.

01:06.522 --> 01:07.899
What you need?

01:11.277 --> 01:13.488
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

01:18.117 --> 01:20.244
Yeah. Punk bitches.

02:10.502 --> 02:11.629
Bounce, little man.

02:11.838 --> 02:15.341
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.802
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.304
Get your ass up here now.

02:23.850 --> 02:27.103
What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

02:28.146 --> 02:30.314
What are you waiting for? Go!

03:36.422 --> 03:39.884
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

03:40.093 --> 03:43.304
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

03:43.513 --> 03:44.764
Absolutely.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.349
As you know...

03:46.557 --> 03:49.560
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

03:51.646 --> 03:53.523
That may no longer be the case.

03:53.731 --> 03:58.236
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

03:58.444 --> 04:00.238
Maybe a pretty good option.

04:00.446 --> 04:03.116
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

04:03.324 --> 04:05.910
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

04:06.119 --> 04:08.454
He's got a good track record.

04:08.663 --> 04:10.248
Pretty good.

04:10.957 --> 04:13.000
It sounds...

04:14.293 --> 04:15.420
...aggressive.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.755
Yes. Very much so.

04:17.964 --> 04:20.757
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

04:20.966 --> 04:23.261
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

04:23.469 --> 04:25.596
And it will.

04:26.431 --> 04:29.475
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

04:29.684 --> 04:32.770
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

04:33.646 --> 04:35.440
...but that's all.

04:35.648 --> 04:37.442
In my opinion...

04:37.650 --> 04:39.944
...if you're willing to take some risk...

04:40.153 --> 04:42.280
...then this offers the best chance.

04:48.828 --> 04:52.874
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

04:53.082 --> 04:55.877
I'd say between 170-...

04:56.085 --> 04:58.504
...and 200,000, all in.

04:58.713 --> 05:02.300
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

05:02.508 --> 05:05.303
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

05:07.388 --> 05:10.975
This is obviously a big decision...

05:11.184 --> 05:14.479
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

05:15.438 --> 05:16.898
No.

05:17.732 --> 05:19.358
I'll do it.

05:24.405 --> 05:29.327
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

05:30.661 --> 05:33.623
I just think it's the way to go.

05:36.584 --> 05:41.005
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

05:42.006 --> 05:44.300
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

05:44.509 --> 05:46.302
...for another couple of weeks...

05:46.511 --> 05:48.805
...and then we'll have at it.

05:50.223 --> 05:52.266
That's tricky.

05:55.061 --> 05:58.523
When's the due date?
-It's the 21 st.

05:58.731 --> 06:00.066
So two weeks and change?

06:00.274 --> 06:02.485
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

06:02.693 --> 06:05.822
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

06:06.030 --> 06:09.367
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

06:10.952 --> 06:12.370
Yeah.

06:29.512 --> 06:32.056
Fourteen messages...

06:32.265 --> 06:34.142
God.

06:37.103 --> 06:38.688
<i>-Yeah.
-It's me.</i>

06:38.896 --> 06:42.316
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

06:42.525 --> 06:43.901
Working.

06:44.110 --> 06:45.445
What is it?

06:48.573 --> 06:50.199
Combo's dead.

06:50.825 --> 06:52.410
<i>Shot.</i>

06:54.120 --> 06:55.246
Which one is he?

06:56.497 --> 06:58.082
You did not just say that to me.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.752
<i>-Jesse, listen-
-That figures.</i>

07:13.473 --> 07:15.058
What's the word on the street?

07:15.850 --> 07:17.894
No one's dropping no names.

07:18.102 --> 07:21.272
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

07:21.481 --> 07:25.276
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

07:26.319 --> 07:30.782
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

07:30.990 --> 07:32.784
...what'd you expect?

07:33.993 --> 07:35.328
I don't know.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.205
You don't know?

07:38.414 --> 07:40.249
Is that all you got?

07:41.501 --> 07:44.295
I'll do right by Combo's people.

07:46.130 --> 07:50.760
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

07:53.012 --> 07:55.640
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

07:55.848 --> 08:00.269
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

08:01.270 --> 08:02.730
I'm on probation, man.

08:02.939 --> 08:05.817
Fast track to Los Lunas.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.404
We're on the verge...

08:09.612 --> 08:13.825
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

08:14.033 --> 08:16.494
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

08:18.329 --> 08:22.333
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.294
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

08:25.503 --> 08:28.381
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

08:28.923 --> 08:31.884
...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
-Yeah?

08:32.092 --> 08:33.845
His junkie bitch copped to it.

08:34.721 --> 08:37.014
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

08:42.019 --> 08:43.520
Everyone knows?

08:45.690 --> 08:49.360
Why didn't you say something?
-I don't know, man.

08:49.569 --> 08:51.028
Because we like you and all.

08:51.237 --> 08:54.365
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

08:55.241 --> 08:56.534
We'll get by.

08:56.743 --> 09:00.538
All right? We'll make it.
-Sorry, Jesse.

09:01.330 --> 09:02.874
I'm out.

09:12.091 --> 09:16.763
We have had a bit of a setback.

09:17.430 --> 09:20.975
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

09:21.184 --> 09:23.978
How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

09:24.187 --> 09:27.356
You are in charge of distribution.
-You said expand the territory.

09:27.565 --> 09:29.984
Doesn't mean you become careless.
-Guys, guys! Hey!

09:30.193 --> 09:33.071
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

09:33.279 --> 09:35.907
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

09:36.115 --> 09:38.159
Now, setback. Go.

09:39.118 --> 09:42.455
One of our dealers was murdered.

09:43.456 --> 09:47.585
It was some kind of turf dispute...

09:47.794 --> 09:49.921
...and apparently we lost.

09:50.296 --> 09:51.839
And then everyone quit on us.

09:52.048 --> 09:55.927
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

09:56.135 --> 09:58.596
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

09:58.805 --> 10:00.848
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

10:03.851 --> 10:05.603
Well, there's your silver lining.

10:05.812 --> 10:08.606
How about you?
How's the health situation?

10:08.815 --> 10:12.110
It's better. Do you mind?

10:12.318 --> 10:13.778
Better?

10:15.279 --> 10:17.156
Yeah, it's...

10:19.200 --> 10:23.413
...looking a little more positive.

10:23.621 --> 10:25.373
I may have more time than I thought.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.417
Outstanding.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.919
Now, as to your dead guy:

10:30.128 --> 10:31.921
occupational hazard.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.381
Drug dealer getting shot?

10:33.589 --> 10:37.635
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

10:37.844 --> 10:40.930
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

10:43.307 --> 10:45.309
Thirty-eight and change.

10:45.518 --> 10:47.395
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

10:47.603 --> 10:48.813
Pounds.

10:51.691 --> 10:54.277
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.571
Guys!

10:56.779 --> 10:58.656
Why the long faces here?

10:58.865 --> 11:00.992
You're sitting on a gold mine.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.286
A gold mine we can't sell.

11:03.494 --> 11:05.788
We need a proper infrastructure.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.332
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

11:08.541 --> 11:10.376
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

11:10.585 --> 11:13.671
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.840
Payback. That's what we need.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.513
God.

11:24.223 --> 11:27.643
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

11:31.314 --> 11:34.692
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

11:35.401 --> 11:37.403
We need your help.

11:38.988 --> 11:41.699
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

11:41.908 --> 11:43.576
Ready for this? Here goes.

11:43.785 --> 11:47.705
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

11:47.914 --> 11:50.375
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.002
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

11:53.211 --> 11:57.632
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.051
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

12:00.259 --> 12:02.887
What, some tattooed speed freak?

12:03.096 --> 12:06.516
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

12:06.724 --> 12:08.518
Somebody who treats your product...

12:08.726 --> 12:12.105
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

12:12.313 --> 12:15.525
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

12:15.733 --> 12:20.071
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.908
You know someone like that?

12:24.117 --> 12:28.079
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

12:28.287 --> 12:30.164
Who knows another guy.

12:30.373 --> 12:34.210
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.256
Well, what's his name?

12:39.590 --> 12:41.050
I have no idea.

12:41.926 --> 12:45.722
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

12:46.889 --> 12:49.058
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

12:49.267 --> 12:51.269
...he sounds a little like you.

12:56.232 --> 12:59.068
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

12:59.277 --> 13:01.863
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

13:02.071 --> 13:05.116
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

13:05.324 --> 13:08.870
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

13:09.078 --> 13:11.122
I need you to leave.

13:19.964 --> 13:22.091
Look, there's...

13:23.092 --> 13:26.179
...some stuff about me
you don't know and...

13:30.224 --> 13:31.726
Like you're a drug dealer?

13:33.519 --> 13:35.063
I kind of got that.

13:36.481 --> 13:40.401
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

13:46.699 --> 13:49.160
One of my guys...

13:49.911 --> 13:52.747
...a friend who worked for me...

13:53.873 --> 13:55.124
...got murdered.

13:57.001 --> 13:59.253
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

14:01.172 --> 14:05.176
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

14:05.385 --> 14:09.430
...being that you're in a programme
and all and...

14:12.600 --> 14:14.477
You could come with me
to a meeting.

14:16.521 --> 14:18.106
No.

14:19.273 --> 14:20.817
No meetings.

14:21.567 --> 14:25.279
We could just get out of here.

14:27.657 --> 14:31.953
It won't help.
-Yeah, it will.

14:32.161 --> 14:34.622
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

14:34.831 --> 14:36.374
I just...

14:36.582 --> 14:40.336
All right, I really just need you to go.

15:47.987 --> 15:49.947
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

15:50.156 --> 15:51.741
Thank you.

16:22.939 --> 16:24.690
You're late.

16:26.192 --> 16:27.485
Yeah.

16:27.693 --> 16:30.488
We're in the big time now.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.408
So where's the kingpin?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.828
Your guess is as good as mine.

16:40.415 --> 16:43.000
So you get the dude's name?

16:43.376 --> 16:44.836
Nope.

16:45.044 --> 16:48.297
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

16:48.506 --> 16:51.592
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

16:54.887 --> 16:57.181
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

16:57.390 --> 16:59.642
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

16:59.851 --> 17:01.519
...looking like a couple chumps?

17:01.728 --> 17:04.521
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

17:05.021 --> 17:06.273
Fine, thanks.

17:08.526 --> 17:11.487
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

17:12.155 --> 17:13.781
I don't get you, man.

17:13.990 --> 17:17.785
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

17:18.994 --> 17:22.330
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.291
Yeah, what about after?

17:24.500 --> 17:27.878
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

17:28.087 --> 17:30.548
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

17:30.757 --> 17:32.884
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

17:33.426 --> 17:36.679
Things have changed.
-Oh, I know.

17:37.513 --> 17:39.307
We got a guy killed.

17:42.977 --> 17:44.645
You know what?

17:46.105 --> 17:47.356
This is bullshit.

17:48.274 --> 17:50.401
I'm out of here.
-Hey.

18:00.286 --> 18:03.414
I think she's waking up from a nap.

18:03.623 --> 18:07.043
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

18:11.589 --> 18:13.257
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

18:13.466 --> 18:15.134
You're on the low side of normal.

18:15.343 --> 18:17.929
What? How low?

18:18.137 --> 18:21.265
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

18:21.474 --> 18:24.977
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.939
Hey.

18:28.147 --> 18:30.274
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

18:30.483 --> 18:32.443
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

18:32.652 --> 18:34.654
Sorry. Hi.
-Hi.

18:34.862 --> 18:37.281
What did I miss?
-For your refrigerator.

18:38.199 --> 18:39.575
Oh, my God.

18:39.784 --> 18:40.993
Look at her.

18:41.202 --> 18:42.620
Look.
-Yeah.

18:42.829 --> 18:45.456
God. It's like she's here already.

18:45.665 --> 18:49.252
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.671
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

18:51.879 --> 18:53.798
It's time to make a decision.

18:54.006 --> 18:57.135
You know what I'm gonna say.
-The C-section?

18:57.343 --> 18:59.595
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

18:59.804 --> 19:05.727
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so...

19:06.185 --> 19:08.855
For the baby, I say yes.

19:09.063 --> 19:11.816
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

19:12.024 --> 19:16.320
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

19:16.529 --> 19:17.989
...a week from Friday?

19:20.867 --> 19:22.660
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

19:27.373 --> 19:29.208
We have a birthday.

19:29.709 --> 19:31.252
The 16th.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.588
I like it.
-Yeah.

19:34.922 --> 19:37.091
You know, speaking of birthdays...

19:37.300 --> 19:40.845
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

19:41.054 --> 19:43.848
It's an hour before closing.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.100
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

19:46.309 --> 19:48.519
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

19:48.728 --> 19:50.354
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

19:50.855 --> 19:52.106
Why you?

19:53.066 --> 19:56.819
Because I said I would...?

19:57.028 --> 19:59.614
It is the least I can do.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.742
Okay?
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.327
Bye.
-Bye.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.919
Let's get out of here.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.338
You know, go do something.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.633
Seriously.

21:00.967 --> 21:04.262
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.806
Let's take a drive.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.437
Sure.

21:30.955 --> 21:33.916
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.044
We're halfway through the job.

21:36.627 --> 21:41.132
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

21:41.966 --> 21:44.927
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

21:45.136 --> 21:46.387
I gotta go.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.598
Dean, I gotta go.

21:48.806 --> 21:50.975
Okay, all right.

21:53.978 --> 21:56.814
Happy birthday!

21:57.690 --> 21:58.983
Happy birthday!

21:59.192 --> 22:02.403
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.323
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

22:06.157 --> 22:09.160
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

22:09.369 --> 22:13.247
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

22:13.456 --> 22:16.667
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

22:18.961 --> 22:21.506
Wait. Skyler?
-Yes?

22:21.714 --> 22:23.299
I wanna hear it first.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.760
Absolutely not. No way.

22:25.968 --> 22:28.221
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

22:28.429 --> 22:31.182
Yes, I can. Watch me.
-Please!

22:31.391 --> 22:35.186
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.856
Come on. It was so good last time.
-It was ages ago.

22:39.065 --> 22:41.943
And I'm enormous now.

22:42.151 --> 22:44.362
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

22:44.570 --> 22:46.864
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

22:47.073 --> 22:49.492
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.452
Seriously.
-Yes, come on, Skyler.

22:51.661 --> 22:56.374
<i>-Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
-It's obscene.</i>

22:56.582 --> 22:59.544
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>

23:09.846 --> 23:15.226
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

23:16.602 --> 23:22.066
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

23:23.609 --> 23:29.824
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

23:30.033 --> 23:34.328
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

23:35.955 --> 23:38.916
<i>Happy birthday</i>

23:40.460 --> 23:43.588
<i>To you</i>

23:47.592 --> 23:49.260
That was fantastic.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.304
Isn't she great, huh?

23:52.055 --> 23:53.890
Okay, here we go.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.613
<i>-He wasn't there.
-Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

24:08.821 --> 24:11.366
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

24:11.574 --> 24:12.700
Nobody came.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.536
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

24:15.745 --> 24:17.997
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

24:18.206 --> 24:20.041
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

24:20.249 --> 24:21.751
<i>-Where was he?
-Who knows?</i>

24:21.959 --> 24:24.629
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

24:24.837 --> 24:26.631
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

24:26.839 --> 24:31.219
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.888
What? What do you mean?

24:34.097 --> 24:35.473
No deal. No dice.

24:35.681 --> 24:37.642
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.102
Wait a minute.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.813
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

24:42.021 --> 24:45.149
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

24:45.983 --> 24:49.821
He's skittish, like a deer.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.074
Call him back.

24:53.282 --> 24:55.326
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

24:55.535 --> 24:58.162
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.623
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

25:00.832 --> 25:03.084
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

25:03.292 --> 25:04.961
Second of all, it's over.

25:05.169 --> 25:07.630
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual...</i>

25:07.839 --> 25:10.216
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>

25:11.467 --> 25:12.677
Look...

25:12.885 --> 25:15.513
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

25:15.722 --> 25:17.473
...but don't get your hopes up.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.435
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

25:20.643 --> 25:22.186
Damn it.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.707
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

27:13.047 --> 27:14.799
Can I help you, sir?

27:16.676 --> 27:18.928
Diet Coke, please.

27:21.013 --> 27:23.891
And five minutes of your time.

27:34.444 --> 27:37.155
What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.491
Please.

27:52.003 --> 27:56.215
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

27:57.592 --> 28:00.303
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

28:01.345 --> 28:05.058
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

28:05.808 --> 28:08.269
I believe that person was you.

28:08.728 --> 28:12.023
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

28:13.357 --> 28:14.776
I don't think I am.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.740
Sir, if you have a complaint...

28:20.948 --> 28:23.201
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

28:23.409 --> 28:25.870
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

28:27.413 --> 28:30.333
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

28:30.541 --> 28:32.835
...is very careful.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.046
A cautious man.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.758
I believe we're alike in that way.

28:40.843 --> 28:44.514
If you are who I think you are...

28:45.056 --> 28:47.141
...you should give me another chance.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.066
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.696
You are not a cautious man at all.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.907
Your partner was late
and he was high.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.828
Yes. Yes, he was.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.832
He's high often, isn't he?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.212
You have poor judgement.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.674
I can't work with someone
with poor judgement.

29:19.882 --> 29:23.010
Are you familiar with my product?

29:23.636 --> 29:27.223
I've been told it's excellent.
-It is impeccable.

29:28.474 --> 29:29.892
It is the purest...

29:30.101 --> 29:33.563
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

29:33.771 --> 29:36.107
That is not the only factor.

29:36.315 --> 29:40.278
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

29:40.486 --> 29:42.947
...and your customers would pay it.

29:43.489 --> 29:45.241
Hands down.

29:45.992 --> 29:52.415
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

29:53.332 --> 29:54.625
You won't see him.

29:54.834 --> 29:57.587
You won't interact with him.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.797
Forget he exists.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.634
I have to ask.

30:05.386 --> 30:06.471
Why?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.473
Why him?

30:10.850 --> 30:13.686
Because he does what I say.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.565
Because I can trust him.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.319
How much product
do you have on hand?

30:22.111 --> 30:23.988
Thirty-eight pounds.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.824
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.916
Will I hear from you?

30:37.585 --> 30:38.961
I have your numbers.

30:43.174 --> 30:47.136
You can never trust a drug addict.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.862
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

31:05.071 --> 31:08.241
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.994
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.746
Dribs and drabs.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.040
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

31:16.249 --> 31:19.711
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

31:19.919 --> 31:25.007
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

31:27.927 --> 31:31.681
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

31:31.889 --> 31:34.892
I found six other instances...

31:36.060 --> 31:38.604
...of revenues being under-reported.

31:39.605 --> 31:42.316
And I've only just started
to look into it.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.903
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.364
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.450
Most of the time, they overestimate.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.077
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

31:53.286 --> 31:55.413
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

31:55.621 --> 31:57.248
Obviously, we forgot...

31:57.457 --> 32:01.461
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

32:01.669 --> 32:04.922
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

32:05.131 --> 32:08.760
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.220
Right.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.014
Right...

32:13.222 --> 32:17.852
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

32:18.061 --> 32:20.438
...to try and sort this out.

32:21.564 --> 32:25.610
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.113
In a few cases...

32:30.531 --> 32:33.785
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.539
Ted.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.343
All right.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.721
You got me.

32:54.263 --> 32:59.143
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.730
What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

33:02.939 --> 33:05.108
...about saving a company.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.110
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

33:07.318 --> 33:09.112
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

33:09.320 --> 33:12.615
...and their college funds
for their kids.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.659
Not to mention my own.

33:14.867 --> 33:17.453
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.330
Yes, it does, Skyler.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.457
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.961
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.629
If I don't keep up-
-Ted.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.674
People go to prison for this.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.766
My dad built this company
from nothing.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.103
We make things here.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.356
The people who work here
are like family.

33:45.898 --> 33:49.652
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.324
Sky...

33:58.119 --> 34:00.121
...don't report this.

34:01.122 --> 34:02.707
Please.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.587
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.886
But I can't be a part of it.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.431
I know.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.310
I know. I just wish...

34:23.436 --> 34:25.146
I'm sorry.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.108
I don't want you to go.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.920
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

34:50.129 --> 34:52.882
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

34:53.091 --> 34:54.926
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

34:55.134 --> 34:56.594
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

34:56.803 --> 34:58.763
<i>Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.</i>

34:58.971 --> 35:01.057
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...</i>

35:01.265 --> 35:03.226
<i>...everyone was all choked up
and shit.</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:06.104
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

35:06.312 --> 35:08.272
<i>And you should have
seen the coffin.</i>

35:08.481 --> 35:10.358
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

35:10.566 --> 35:13.653
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

35:13.861 --> 35:16.823
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

35:17.031 --> 35:20.243
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

35:20.451 --> 35:23.538
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

36:06.039 --> 36:07.999
I like to mix some ice with it.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.216
Hold that.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.053
What's it feel like?

37:05.723 --> 37:07.517
There's a chill.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.978
Don't freak out. It passes.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.730
And then...

37:12.939 --> 37:14.065
You'll see.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.488
I'll meet you there.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.876
Take that off.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.862
Phones off, please.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.007
Pipes, I guess.

40:26.215 --> 40:29.010
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.679
Eyes on your paper.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.112
Yes.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.003
Excuse me, where's the manager?

41:04.212 --> 41:06.506
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

41:06.714 --> 41:10.134
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

41:10.343 --> 41:13.221
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.972
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.016
Oh, owner. Okay.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.977
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.480
He could be at any one of them.

41:23.648 --> 41:27.235
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

41:27.443 --> 41:30.154
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

41:30.363 --> 41:33.449
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.493
No, no.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.662
What's his name?
-Gustavo.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.372
Gus.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.581
Thank you.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.296
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.967
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.510
One hour.
-What?

41:52.719 --> 41:54.095
One hour. You in or out?

41:54.721 --> 41:57.890
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.101
One hour. If you miss it...

42:00.309 --> 42:03.020
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.863
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

42:12.071 --> 42:15.199
<i>-Come on! Come on!
-Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

42:15.408 --> 42:18.202
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.246
Pick up the phone.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.791
I'm coming by. I need the product.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.793
I need the product now.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.676
Oh, God.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.606
Jesse.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.653
Jesse!

43:34.278 --> 43:35.905
Jesse.

43:36.739 --> 43:38.449
Jesse.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.055
Jesse. Jesse.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.016
Jesse.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.999
Jesse.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.792
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.669
Jesse.

44:32.420 --> 44:35.006
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

44:35.214 --> 44:36.340
Wake up!

44:36.549 --> 44:38.134
Come on, damn it.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.635
Wake up.

44:41.012 --> 44:42.013
Where'd you put it?

44:42.221 --> 44:43.973
Where's the product?
-Get off of me.

44:44.182 --> 44:47.060
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

44:47.268 --> 44:49.020
In the kitchen.
-Where?

44:49.854 --> 44:51.856
Under the sink.

45:54.293 --> 45:59.257
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
