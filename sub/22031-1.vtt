00:45.621 --> 00:48.146
What're you doing, Sprout, huh?

00:48.673 --> 00:51.853
What are you doing?
Come here, look at you.

00:51.887 --> 00:54.558
Ah.

00:54.592 --> 00:56.527
You gonna walk for me?

00:56.561 --> 00:58.399
You gonna walk for your dad?

00:58.434 --> 01:00.340
Let's try walking again.

01:00.374 --> 01:02.046
There you go.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.914
All right, there you go.

01:03.949 --> 01:07.054
Look at you, big boy now, huh?

01:07.089 --> 01:08.657
There.

01:08.692 --> 01:10.998
See? It's easy.

01:11.033 --> 01:13.789
Huh? Look at you.
(Kisses)

01:14.841 --> 01:17.314
Keep going, keep going.

01:18.917 --> 01:21.658
Sure you want him
to learn to walk so soon?

01:21.694 --> 01:23.968
Well, he's almost a year old.

01:24.002 --> 01:26.587
Faster he learns to walk,
the sooner he learns to march.

01:27.302 --> 01:29.045
That's a good point.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.386
Nah, you're a smart one, Thomas, huh?

01:31.549 --> 01:34.325
Just like your ma, huh?

01:34.359 --> 01:36.163
(Door opens)

01:41.573 --> 01:43.271
Afternoon.

02:04.579 --> 02:07.113
I thought regulars were trained
to fold their own bedding.

02:07.148 --> 02:10.419
He'll be out before Christmas.

02:10.454 --> 02:11.953
They will.

02:11.987 --> 02:15.325
This fighting can't last.

02:15.359 --> 02:18.731
If one redcoat in the house is as
close as it comes to us, then...

02:21.201 --> 02:25.172
then I shall thank the Lord
and be done with it.

02:39.894 --> 02:43.564
(Blade slices)

03:05.530 --> 03:08.798
(Men laughing, chattering)

03:14.308 --> 03:18.479
It's a pity His Majesty don't
pay for scalps no more, huh?

03:18.513 --> 03:20.682
Used to offer 130 cobs a head.

03:20.716 --> 03:23.320
For men, not for boys under 12.

03:23.355 --> 03:24.956
(Men laugh)

03:24.991 --> 03:29.463
That's all Washington
has left to send is boys.

03:30.832 --> 03:32.699
Aye, Major?

03:32.734 --> 03:36.670
Washington coulda had men.
(Urinating)

03:36.705 --> 03:39.476
Coulda had Rangers.

03:40.073 --> 03:44.033
If he were bolder,
not so tight with his purse.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.000
Those pups died for nothing.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.568
<i>â™ª Across the hills... â™ª</i>

03:54.854 --> 03:56.890

03:56.924 --> 04:00.927
(Footsteps sloshing)

04:00.962 --> 04:04.330
- (Gasps)
- (Blade slicing)

04:11.907 --> 04:14.076
(Groans)

04:29.787 --> 04:31.453
(Gurgling)

04:35.393 --> 04:38.529
(Singing continues)

04:48.578 --> 04:50.279
Welsh!

04:52.383 --> 04:54.620
Oi, Welsh!

04:54.654 --> 04:56.623
Are you done yet?

05:14.538 --> 05:17.106
(Slices)

05:23.608 --> 05:25.508
The damn fool makes for the trees

05:25.542 --> 05:27.343
when I've told him a hundred times,

05:27.377 --> 05:29.812
you start on the outside
and work your way in.

05:29.846 --> 05:32.480
He's a greenhorn, huh?

05:41.988 --> 05:45.755
(Imitates birdcall)

05:51.961 --> 05:54.364
- Ah!
- (Grunts)

05:54.398 --> 05:56.401
MAN: Come on, lads!
Let's run him, boys!

05:56.435 --> 05:59.237
Let's run him like a dog!

06:02.513 --> 06:04.783
- Come on, lads!
- (Shouting)

06:04.817 --> 06:07.119
(Gunfire)

06:14.595 --> 06:17.662
SOLDIER: They were waiting for us.
They knew where we would be.

06:17.696 --> 06:20.668
- MAN: They couldn't have known.
- They were waiting.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.271
How?

06:25.305 --> 06:29.108
These were not
Tory militia or Regulars.

06:29.143 --> 06:33.378
They... they were Queen's Rangers.

06:42.891 --> 06:45.126
Was it Robert Rogers?

06:48.765 --> 06:50.231
It was luck, then.

06:50.266 --> 06:53.400
Just bad luck you ran into him.

06:53.434 --> 06:54.903
I asked for a coat.

06:54.937 --> 06:56.405
Luck?

06:56.440 --> 06:59.343
Sir, luck had nothing to do with this.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.177
We both know that. The...

07:02.978 --> 07:06.751
The British, they use Rogers and
his mercenaries like a bear trap,

07:06.785 --> 07:08.918
and they knew precisely
where to set him.

07:08.952 --> 07:11.421
This was an ambush planned in advance.

07:11.456 --> 07:14.460
Are you saying there's a
breach within our ranks?

07:27.501 --> 07:29.599
I'm saying

07:29.634 --> 07:33.170
that they have spies everywhere, sir...

07:34.339 --> 07:37.273
and that we need the same.

07:37.307 --> 07:39.274
See to your shoulder.

07:39.309 --> 07:41.476
After you've recovered,
I'll assign you new men.

07:41.510 --> 07:44.845
General, please.
These scouting runs, they're suicide.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.115
We have discussed this,
Captain Tallmadge.

07:47.149 --> 07:50.017
I will not waste money on informers.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.487
I agree, sir.
All I would need from you

07:52.521 --> 07:57.288
is one man to serve as a courier
between myself and a friend in New York.

07:57.322 --> 08:00.392
- If we can establish...
- New York?

08:00.426 --> 08:03.229
After Washington has burned it
to the ground upon our retreat?

08:04.131 --> 08:05.498
Benjamin...

08:07.366 --> 08:10.165
we have no friends in New York.

08:14.502 --> 08:17.237
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

08:17.271 --> 08:19.572

08:57.968 --> 08:59.786
It's bad.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.828

Come on.

09:49.863 --> 09:52.129
(Clicks tongue)
Come on, hup.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.373
(Bleating)

10:18.243 --> 10:21.044
(Men cheering, laughing)

10:27.047 --> 10:29.017
(Coins jingle)

10:30.836 --> 10:34.510
Mr. Strong! Four ales, please!

10:49.236 --> 10:53.141
- Good evening, Selah.
- Thought you didn't like my tavern.

11:00.316 --> 11:03.581
- What's this?
- I said I would repay my debt.

11:04.086 --> 11:06.955
We're not even halfway
through the season.

11:06.989 --> 11:09.124
This is only half of what I owe.

11:10.959 --> 11:14.261
- The harvest isn't coming in as I hoped.
- Loopers or maggots?

11:14.296 --> 11:16.162
I just need more time, Selah,
and then next season, I swear...

11:16.196 --> 11:19.301
Next season? Of course, why not?

11:19.335 --> 11:24.307
Perhaps by then you just pay me
back with my own cauliflower.

11:27.315 --> 11:28.949
Abraham.

11:36.256 --> 11:38.590
To what do we owe the pleasure?

11:38.625 --> 11:41.960
Abe and I were
just discussing maggots.

11:41.994 --> 11:43.461
Maggots?

11:43.496 --> 11:45.798
Mrs. Strong, here, here!

11:48.469 --> 11:51.971
I hear they've been dethroned
as Setauket's reigning pests.

11:52.006 --> 11:55.341
- Ahem.
- Your rooms are ready, gentlemen.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.942
Well, I should be off, so...

11:57.976 --> 11:59.810
No, now, wait.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.179
We hardly see you anymore.

12:03.114 --> 12:06.485
How is Mary and Thomas?

12:06.520 --> 12:08.220
They're both well.

12:09.656 --> 12:12.359
- I really should...
- You should come for dinner

12:12.393 --> 12:14.260
at our house. The three of you.

12:14.295 --> 12:17.797
- SELAH: Anna.
- I fear that wouldn't feel right.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.100
I owe your husband a debt.

12:24.135 --> 12:27.501
I would be shamed for you to cook
for us while I'm in arrears.

12:28.435 --> 12:30.369
I didn't know about this.

12:31.404 --> 12:34.472
Bloody news! Bloody news!

12:34.507 --> 12:37.573
"Where are the rebels now?"

12:37.608 --> 12:40.777
To the brave Patriot commander

12:40.812 --> 12:43.481
on the eve of his retreat...

12:43.515 --> 12:47.218
"Pardon, his charge
into northern New Jersey."

12:47.252 --> 12:48.820
(Soldiers laughing)

12:48.855 --> 12:51.791
"Pulled back from the line,
a most propitious sign,

12:51.825 --> 12:54.395
for Mrs. Washington, that sow."

12:54.429 --> 12:57.699
(Laughing)

12:57.733 --> 13:00.770
"Alas, before his return,
dear Georgie must discern

13:00.804 --> 13:03.806
in what place he should
sheathe his saber."

13:03.840 --> 13:05.274
(Laughing continues)

13:05.309 --> 13:07.644
- SOLDIER: "But surely..."
- Go upstairs.

13:07.678 --> 13:09.130
Selah, don't.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.806
"...the joke of it all
is that his scabbard calls

13:11.883 --> 13:15.087
for any puff's sword he can stow."

13:15.121 --> 13:19.259
(Laughing, pounding)

13:21.663 --> 13:23.231
Get out, Robeson.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.464
I'm sorry, did I offend

13:26.499 --> 13:28.766
your sensitive liberal puff cake?

13:28.801 --> 13:30.969
You offended my wife.
Now, leave.

13:31.003 --> 13:34.139
MAN:
Come off it, man.

13:34.173 --> 13:37.709
We're celebrating your
king's victory in New York.

13:37.743 --> 13:39.578
ROBESON: Though we understand
how that might upset

13:39.612 --> 13:42.112
a certain delegate
to the Provincial Congress.

13:42.146 --> 13:43.979
- Drunk.
- Whig.

13:50.116 --> 13:52.984
- You stupid...
- Anna, don't, don't, don't.

13:53.019 --> 13:55.053
(Glass shatters)

13:55.087 --> 13:56.322
(Groans)

13:56.356 --> 13:58.760
SOLDIER:
Did he just hit Captain Joyce?

14:01.229 --> 14:03.330
(Glasses shatter)

14:05.002 --> 14:07.272
(Groans)

14:08.641 --> 14:10.242
Let me help you.
Let me get that for you.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.655
- Out of my way.
- Here, it's fine.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.917
Take your coat off.
There you are, just...

14:14.952 --> 14:17.223
- (Fabric rips)
- Ah!

14:17.257 --> 14:19.658
Release the captain, please.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.600
Of course.

14:24.634 --> 14:26.202
(Groans)

14:27.904 --> 14:30.642
(Coughs)

14:34.445 --> 14:36.646
(Glass shattering)

14:39.518 --> 14:41.620
(Sawing)

14:45.821 --> 14:48.989
Leave room for two nooses.

14:51.492 --> 14:53.269
JOYCE:
Court-martialed?

14:53.931 --> 14:56.897
Major, please. Show mercy.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.400
Law, order,

14:59.734 --> 15:02.103
authority.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.839
We are the beacon of authority

15:03.874 --> 15:05.341
in these colonies, Captain,

15:05.375 --> 15:08.208
and we bear the burden
of that authority.

15:08.243 --> 15:10.143
Major...

15:10.177 --> 15:13.579
"Because authority,
though it err like others,"

15:13.613 --> 15:17.082
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself

15:17.116 --> 15:20.352
"that skins the vice o' the top."

15:20.387 --> 15:23.187
- Do you understand?
- Is the major in?

15:23.222 --> 15:25.009
Wait here.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.860
Sir, this colonist has struck

15:27.894 --> 15:30.394
an officer of His Majesty's
Royal Army.

15:30.428 --> 15:32.196
Now, once I testify...

15:32.230 --> 15:34.832
- You will not be court-martialed here.
- Oh.

15:34.867 --> 15:37.437
You will return to England,

15:37.471 --> 15:41.141
where you'll be cashiered
directly upon arrival.

15:41.175 --> 15:42.609
Dismissed.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.035
I knew that you would come.

16:06.069 --> 16:08.971
I wish to offer my services,
for whatever they may be worth.

16:09.005 --> 16:12.243
Mm, this is not a matter
for the provincial court.

16:12.277 --> 16:15.483
One of my men was assaulted.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.551
- This must be redressed.
- Without question.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.453
But by the looks
of Captain Joyce just now,

16:19.487 --> 16:21.087
I can tell there's more to this story,

16:21.121 --> 16:23.926
and I thought I would
shed light on a few facts

16:23.961 --> 16:25.895
in the service of clarity.

16:25.929 --> 16:29.331
It involves some social
history of Setauket.

16:29.365 --> 16:31.300
Provincial ephemera

16:31.334 --> 16:33.336
and the passions of young people.

16:33.370 --> 16:34.504
Probably worthless.

16:34.538 --> 16:38.241
(Blows)
What history?

16:40.083 --> 16:44.282
Anna Strong,
the wife of Selah Strong,

16:44.316 --> 16:48.919
was engaged three years ago
to Abraham Woodhull.

16:48.953 --> 16:50.686
You mean Abraham, your son.

16:50.721 --> 16:53.026
Yes, they were childhood
friends, you see,

16:53.060 --> 16:55.397
and our families shared friendship

16:55.431 --> 16:59.799
until her father's patriot
politics drove us to disagreement.

16:59.834 --> 17:03.806
Anna, unfortunately, took
her father's views to heart

17:03.840 --> 17:07.174
and so broke the heart of my son,

17:07.209 --> 17:09.477
who was raised to love
the law above all else.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.114
"Love will not be spurred
to what it loathes."

17:15.483 --> 17:18.663
So, why, then, did he rush
to the aid of her husband,

17:18.686 --> 17:21.790
a suspected patriot?

17:21.824 --> 17:25.060
Abraham has a dreamer's heart,

17:25.095 --> 17:27.097
a romantic heart,

17:27.132 --> 17:30.299
his mother's heart, if truth be told.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.137
And he keeps room there for Anna

17:33.171 --> 17:35.005
in spite of her betrayal.

17:35.039 --> 17:37.540
Mm.

17:37.574 --> 17:39.842
"Alas, that love,

17:39.876 --> 17:42.612
so gentle in his view..."

17:42.646 --> 17:46.818
BOTH: "...should be so
tyrannous and rough in proof."

17:54.726 --> 17:57.095
(Panting)

18:00.938 --> 18:02.771
Evening, Woodhull.

18:02.805 --> 18:04.239
What are you doing?

18:04.273 --> 18:06.510
(Slices rope)

18:07.446 --> 18:09.146
Where are you taking Selah?

18:09.181 --> 18:12.614
It's past curfew.
Run home to your father.

18:16.016 --> 18:19.852
(Thunder crashing)

18:37.959 --> 18:39.661
(Door opens)

18:39.696 --> 18:42.196
(Panting)

18:42.230 --> 18:44.065
(Door closes)

18:46.801 --> 18:48.968
- Let me see you.
- I'm fine.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.403
Just a few bumps, that's all.

18:50.437 --> 18:52.304
(Winces)
Ah, ah.

18:52.338 --> 18:54.973
How did this happen?
Why would you even go to that place?

18:55.008 --> 18:56.909
Mary, Mary.

18:56.944 --> 18:59.881
I'm fine. I'm home.

19:01.582 --> 19:03.450
I went down the tavern
for a drink, is all.

19:03.485 --> 19:06.722
Lord knows I could do with another one.
(Winces)

19:06.757 --> 19:09.290
- Eat something first.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.802
(Groans)

19:29.811 --> 19:31.380
Is that one of mine?

19:31.415 --> 19:33.082
They were your brother's
before they were yours.

19:33.117 --> 19:34.784
I thought you wouldn't mind
if I brought one

19:34.819 --> 19:37.187
for my little soldier here.

19:37.221 --> 19:39.430
I don't know what
Major Hewlett told you

19:39.596 --> 19:42.393
or what was said to him, but the
fault with this lies with...

19:42.428 --> 19:45.127
- Selah Strong.
- With John Robeson.

19:45.161 --> 19:48.093
He was the one
who started the fight.

19:48.128 --> 19:50.860
And Captain Joyce,
who was well into his cup,

19:50.894 --> 19:52.798
slipped and cut his hand
on one. That is all.

19:52.832 --> 19:54.267
I doubt that's how he'll testify,

19:54.302 --> 19:56.770
so be glad that testimony
won't name you.

19:59.006 --> 20:00.406
Abraham...

20:02.109 --> 20:04.343
why did you take money
from that man?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.653
I warned you about Selah Strong.

20:07.778 --> 20:11.515
- He's choleric by nature.
- (Thomas crying)

20:11.550 --> 20:14.752
You should've come to me if
you needed specie or credit.

20:14.787 --> 20:16.385
I have contacts on New York Island

20:16.419 --> 20:18.384
who'd buy my hogs
at twice the market value.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.052
All I need is someone
to run them into the city.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.692
Sprout, let me give you
a little piece of advice

20:23.726 --> 20:26.463
that my father here gave to me once.

20:26.497 --> 20:28.898
"Neither a lender nor a borrower be."

20:28.932 --> 20:30.266
You wouldn't have borrowed.
You would have worked.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.267
(Thomas crying)

20:35.068 --> 20:37.238
Good boy. Shh.

20:37.272 --> 20:38.840
Good boy.

20:38.874 --> 20:40.441
Good night.

20:47.682 --> 20:49.251
(Sighs)

20:49.285 --> 20:51.487
(Winces)
Let's have it.

21:02.671 --> 21:04.737
I'll speak plain now.

21:06.339 --> 21:09.407
You have responsibilities
to more than this farm,

21:09.441 --> 21:11.007
to more than yourself.

21:11.042 --> 21:14.944
- But, Father, I...
- Legacy is everything.

21:14.978 --> 21:19.282
If you wish to preserve ours,
then stay away from those

21:19.316 --> 21:22.186
who've already chosen
to sully theirs.

21:22.221 --> 21:25.888
The Smiths, the Strongs,
the Tallmadges...

21:25.923 --> 21:28.024
they chose the wrong side.

21:29.060 --> 21:30.561
I wasn't taking sides.

21:34.131 --> 21:36.830
I was just trying to do right.

21:36.865 --> 21:39.701
Try harder.

21:41.705 --> 21:43.370
And think on my offer.

21:44.706 --> 21:46.642
Good night.

21:49.879 --> 21:53.680
(Door opens, closes)

21:54.848 --> 21:58.250
(Rain pattering)

22:03.386 --> 22:05.719
(Shivering)

22:05.753 --> 22:07.386
- Who's that? Who's there?
- It's me, it's me.

22:07.420 --> 22:10.021
What are you doing?
There's a sentry.

22:10.056 --> 22:12.256
He's staying dry for now.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.893
We don't have much time,
all right, so please listen well.

22:14.927 --> 22:17.462
They are planning to charge
you with insurrection.

22:17.496 --> 22:19.399
I struck a redcoat,
that's all that matters.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.734
No, no, not if you plead
guilty to the first charge.

22:21.768 --> 22:24.169
Look, everyone knows
that Joyce is a drunkard.

22:24.203 --> 22:27.872
They don't want to hang anyone in
Setauket, not in secure territory.

22:27.906 --> 22:31.644
They're gonna send you
instead to the Jersey.

22:31.678 --> 22:34.412
- Prison ship?
- Where you have friends.

22:34.446 --> 22:36.946
You know others who have gone
and others who have gotten out.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.299
- If you bribe someone...
- Is that why you came here?

22:39.376 --> 22:41.372
To tell me this?

22:41.623 --> 22:43.223
No, I came here to warn you.

22:43.257 --> 22:45.591
And to have me forgive
your debt, no doubt.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.427
No, I said I'd repay my debt in full.

22:47.461 --> 22:49.331
I promised you that.

22:51.267 --> 22:53.867
I'll make you a new deal.

22:53.902 --> 22:55.635
What?

22:58.575 --> 23:00.675
Take care of her for me.

23:07.148 --> 23:10.752
She'll be all alone to run
our house and the tavern.

23:14.857 --> 23:18.491
You take care of Anna while I'm gone

23:18.526 --> 23:20.695
and I will forgive you your debt.

23:20.729 --> 23:23.032
I don't need your forgiveness.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.838
You are her husband, Selah.

23:31.508 --> 23:34.375
And I'm going to repay my debt.

25:46.702 --> 25:49.069
This is all very secret.

25:49.104 --> 25:52.937
This is war.
You never know who's listening.

25:52.972 --> 25:55.375
Some intelligence for you, John.

25:55.409 --> 25:57.945
England controls the harbor,

25:57.979 --> 26:00.813
a bunch of blokes in red out there,

26:00.848 --> 26:03.230
big navy behind 'em.

26:05.380 --> 26:06.713
Thank you.

26:06.748 --> 26:09.048
This is why you're worth
every penny,

26:09.082 --> 26:11.915
no matter what
General Clinton says.

26:11.950 --> 26:15.650
- Oh, what's that?
- A test.

26:16.068 --> 26:17.770
Not for me.

26:17.804 --> 26:19.805
For my source
within the rebel camp.

26:19.839 --> 26:23.373
It's the location of a
secret store in Connecticut,

26:23.407 --> 26:25.876
a safe house.

26:25.910 --> 26:27.947
We want you to give it
the treatment

26:27.981 --> 26:29.550
you gave the Continental Dragoons.

26:29.585 --> 26:31.453
Scraps.

26:31.488 --> 26:33.623
Feed it to your Regulars.

26:33.657 --> 26:36.028
If the intelligence
continues to prove true,

26:36.062 --> 26:39.065
I can trust his word
on targets with higher value...

26:40.433 --> 26:43.233
- (Tinkling)
- ...like Washington.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.505
Who is this mythical
source of yours, John?

26:50.743 --> 26:52.908
Someone I know?

26:54.543 --> 26:56.077
You won't do it?

27:00.219 --> 27:02.154
- For double, we will.

27:02.189 --> 27:04.722
Recompense for the last test.

27:04.755 --> 27:08.490
Recompense? You lost one man.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.926
And a coat.

27:11.961 --> 27:14.397
And a bonnet.

27:54.471 --> 27:56.339
- Don't bloody move.
- Wait, wait.

27:56.374 --> 27:57.906
I only came here to trade.

27:57.940 --> 28:00.139
I've got cabbage.
Fresh cabbage, four bushel.

28:00.173 --> 28:04.975
Four bushel?
You got nothing I want, Woody.

28:05.009 --> 28:07.376
- Woody?
- Yeah.

28:07.410 --> 28:09.442
- Caleb!
- (Laughs)

28:09.476 --> 28:11.776
Let me look at that boy.
Look at that face.

28:11.811 --> 28:14.276
- Caleb Brewster.
- (Laughs)

28:14.310 --> 28:17.746
Right, I was hoping to see
someone I knew come across.

28:17.781 --> 28:20.979
But this privateer here,
this pirate of produce...

28:21.014 --> 28:23.917
- Come here! (Grunts)
- ...this Viking of vegetables!

28:23.951 --> 28:25.287

28:25.322 --> 28:28.093
Vintage Brewster.

28:30.329 --> 28:32.798

- Greenland?

28:32.832 --> 28:34.399
- Yeah.
- It ain't green.

28:34.433 --> 28:36.333
- Oh.
- Aye.

28:36.367 --> 28:37.700
Well, it's right up your alley,
though, isn't it, Caleb?

28:37.735 --> 28:39.936
- Aye.
- Harpoons and darkness

28:39.970 --> 28:42.304
and vomiting seamen in boats
and all that stuff.

28:42.338 --> 28:44.872
And more lucre than you've
ever seen, farm boy.

28:44.906 --> 28:47.174
Outside this black market, of course.

28:47.208 --> 28:50.742
Where else am I gonna trade
this finest cask of Madeira

28:50.777 --> 28:53.881
for a head of Setauket cabbage?

28:53.916 --> 28:55.915
All because of those
poor souls in the Bowery

28:55.950 --> 28:57.781
can't get no healthy greens.

28:57.815 --> 28:59.717
And those across the Hudson

28:59.752 --> 29:03.190
can't get no decent box of tea.

29:03.224 --> 29:06.124
I never said I was trading for tea.

29:07.293 --> 29:10.363
I do have silk, though, from Cathay.

29:10.397 --> 29:12.266
Pounds, Caleb.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.870
My haul there, it's worth 20.

29:14.904 --> 29:17.006
(Laughs)

29:17.040 --> 29:18.920
I'll pay you double that
in Continental dollars.

29:18.942 --> 29:20.610
(Scoffs)
No, you're fine.

29:20.644 --> 29:22.780
I've already wiped my arse today.
Thanks, Caleb.

29:22.814 --> 29:25.083
Now I gotta be heading back.

29:25.117 --> 29:26.952
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:28.722 --> 29:31.259
You're in such a hurry
to leave your old friend, huh?

29:31.293 --> 29:35.268
Who knows when we'll
see each other again?

29:35.302 --> 29:39.208
You know I can't
show my face back home.

29:39.242 --> 29:42.379
You know, I hear that
they tore out the pulpit

29:42.413 --> 29:43.945
from Reverend Tallmadge's church.

29:43.980 --> 29:47.280
Ripped out the pews,
made it into barracks.

29:47.314 --> 29:48.851
Is that true?

29:53.591 --> 29:55.691
How many are stationed there?

29:58.059 --> 30:00.894
Look, I just keep my eye
on my crop, mostly.

30:00.928 --> 30:02.861
When you're not smuggling it.

30:02.895 --> 30:04.229
No, this was a onetime deal.

30:04.263 --> 30:06.699
Onetime?

30:06.733 --> 30:09.567
You won't see my face again
until the war is over.

30:43.335 --> 30:45.134
You all right?

30:46.972 --> 30:50.141
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I didn't hear you.

30:50.175 --> 30:51.811
Captain.

30:52.102 --> 30:56.050
I purchased Captain Joyce's commission
in the wake of his death.

30:56.085 --> 30:57.983
Death?

30:58.017 --> 31:01.952
His body was found this morning
in a field with his throat slit.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.524
You haven't heard?

31:04.558 --> 31:07.197
No, I...

31:07.231 --> 31:09.333
I've been at home.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.434
Have you seen Abraham Woodhull?

31:12.469 --> 31:16.074
What? No.

31:16.109 --> 31:17.977
Why are you asking me this?

31:18.011 --> 31:20.479
An officer in
His Majesty's Army is dead

31:20.513 --> 31:22.515
following an altercation
with your husband

31:22.550 --> 31:24.154
and with Mr. Woodhull.

31:24.188 --> 31:26.827
Now, your husband has been
shipped off to prison

31:26.861 --> 31:29.528
and Mr. Woodhull
is nowhere to be found.

31:29.562 --> 31:32.198
(Breathing heavily)

31:36.940 --> 31:39.076
I meant no...

31:40.346 --> 31:42.214
Wait.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.651
Accept my apology.

31:49.724 --> 31:51.992
I know how you must feel...

31:53.260 --> 31:55.493
with your husband gone,

31:55.528 --> 31:58.066
in your house alone.

31:59.736 --> 32:02.639
I can only imagine your distress.

32:04.942 --> 32:08.348
You need someone to protect you.

32:08.382 --> 32:12.519
Captain, I beg you,
if you are a gentleman,

32:12.554 --> 32:15.723
let me attend to my house in peace.

32:18.398 --> 32:19.800
Thank you.

32:19.834 --> 32:23.236
I shall have my laundry
ready by week's end.

32:23.270 --> 32:26.305
This is my house, too.

32:26.340 --> 32:29.977
I'm to be quartered here
by order of Major Hewlett.

32:30.012 --> 32:33.047
I've already chosen which room.

32:41.919 --> 32:45.389
(Insects chirping)

33:16.334 --> 33:19.136
(Snoring)

33:32.951 --> 33:35.317
- (Gunshot)
- (Gasps)

33:38.154 --> 33:40.188
I'm not armed. Not armed.

33:40.223 --> 33:41.755
Identify yourself.

33:41.789 --> 33:45.559
Abraham Woodhull, from Setauket.

33:47.196 --> 33:50.263
- Nice night for a sail, Woodhull?
- I thought so, yeah.

33:50.297 --> 33:52.396
What's under the tarp?

33:56.002 --> 33:59.343
Could I maybe interest you
gentlemen in a nice bolt of silk?

34:00.978 --> 34:03.777
You're under arrest by order
of the Continental Congress.

34:03.811 --> 34:07.545
- Charge is illegal trade.
- Wait! Wait!

34:07.579 --> 34:10.780
(Muffled yelling)

34:10.813 --> 34:12.650
You're not just a smuggler, are you?

34:12.685 --> 34:15.418
(Coughing, gasping)

34:15.453 --> 34:17.387
(Muffled yelling)

34:17.422 --> 34:20.592
- (Water dripping)
- (Abe coughing)

34:20.627 --> 34:24.625
Enough! That's enough.

34:26.693 --> 34:28.695
(Gasping)

34:28.728 --> 34:32.166
I know him. He's not a spy.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.199
(Abe coughing)

34:35.233 --> 34:38.703
Your name came through
on a dispatch, Mr. Woodhull.

34:39.737 --> 34:41.409
Ben?

34:41.444 --> 34:43.844
Tallmadge, is that you?

34:43.879 --> 34:46.145
I set out from camp immediately.

34:50.985 --> 34:53.985
It is you. It is you, thank God.

34:54.021 --> 34:56.056
Thank God.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.431
Ben, can you get me out of here?

35:00.465 --> 35:01.999
Of course you can. Look at you.

35:02.033 --> 35:05.171
- All right, just slow down.
- Look at you.

35:05.205 --> 35:07.671
Ben, you know me.
I'm no smuggler.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.074
- This is the first time...
- I know that, I know.

35:10.109 --> 35:13.243
I told them
that you were a man of integrity

35:13.276 --> 35:15.677
and that you'd make
every effort to cooperate.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.911
Thank you.

35:17.945 --> 35:19.277
Cooperate?

35:19.311 --> 35:21.410
They need to know
who your contact was,

35:21.444 --> 35:23.777
to make sure you weren't
giving aid to the enemy.

35:25.045 --> 35:26.782
Ben, who is the enemy?

35:26.903 --> 35:28.632
I told them that you
would never do something like that.

35:28.667 --> 35:31.584
You know both sides
close an eye to this trade.

35:31.618 --> 35:34.186
Trust me,
the enemy did not benefit here.

35:34.220 --> 35:37.924
I do, I do trust you, Abe,
and I can get you out,

35:37.959 --> 35:40.861
but you have to tell me who your
contact was at Frog's Point.

35:44.465 --> 35:46.868
What's your true purpose here?

35:48.572 --> 35:51.873
You didn't ride all this way
just to get me out of trouble.

35:51.907 --> 35:55.745
This is a pardon for your release

35:55.780 --> 35:57.413
signed by Governor Trumbull...

35:57.447 --> 35:59.448
whom I convinced you were a friend.

35:59.483 --> 36:01.051
Yeah...

36:01.086 --> 36:02.556
if I tell you who I traded with.

36:02.590 --> 36:04.070
Look, this shouldn't be a negotiation.

36:04.093 --> 36:05.559
Well, good, because
I'm not giving the name

36:05.593 --> 36:07.660
of someone who's just trying to get by

36:07.695 --> 36:10.700
and who doesn't deserve
to be thrown in this hell

36:10.735 --> 36:13.268
by the same Congress that
declares for our freedom.

36:13.302 --> 36:15.702
I won't do it.

36:27.278 --> 36:29.343
Why are you really here?

36:29.377 --> 36:33.248
As I said, I have a permit signed by
the governor for you to return home.

36:33.283 --> 36:37.749
He signed it after receiving word
from General Washington himself.

36:37.784 --> 36:41.721
- Washington...
- (Chatting)

36:41.756 --> 36:44.157
Look, we're of a mind

36:44.191 --> 36:46.657
that if you can smuggle cabbage,

36:46.691 --> 36:50.160
you can smuggle something
more valuable...

36:50.194 --> 36:52.029
information.

36:52.063 --> 36:55.331
- You've come to enlist me?
- To recruit you.

36:55.365 --> 36:57.667
(Chuckles)

36:57.668 --> 37:01.268
Abe, Congress does a lot more
than just declare for your freedom.

37:01.305 --> 37:04.640
They fight for it. I fight for it.
Men die for it.

37:04.675 --> 37:06.442
Well, I don't ask anyone
to fight for me.

37:06.476 --> 37:08.943
I'm asking you.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.979
Come on, we grew up together, Abe,

37:12.013 --> 37:14.315
and I remember who you are,
even if you've forgotten.

37:14.350 --> 37:17.486
All I ask is that you
fight for what you believe in.

37:20.919 --> 37:22.839
I don't know what information
I could possibly...

37:22.862 --> 37:25.364
Military... number of men,
number of cannons,

37:25.399 --> 37:27.367
naval transports,
whether they're moving,

37:27.401 --> 37:29.370
if so, where, what arrivals...

37:29.404 --> 37:30.938
Ben, do you realize
what you're asking me?

37:30.973 --> 37:33.277
You won't have to risk
crossing the Belt again.

37:33.311 --> 37:34.978
Instead, you'll signal for a courier.

37:35.012 --> 37:37.145
I have a system all worked out.

37:39.916 --> 37:43.155
Well, have you worked out
how to explain my absence?

37:43.190 --> 37:44.992
I was supposed to be back yesterday.

37:45.026 --> 37:47.093
Use the truth.

37:47.127 --> 37:48.562
You were on the black market.

37:48.596 --> 37:50.131
Both sides close an eye to that trade.

37:55.269 --> 37:57.470
Well, I shall need proof of that.

37:57.505 --> 37:59.405
The silk...

38:01.675 --> 38:03.243
and the 12 pounds.

38:03.277 --> 38:04.977
(Scoffs)

38:11.352 --> 38:13.352
(Coins jingle)

38:15.454 --> 38:17.253
So, that's it?

38:19.556 --> 38:21.491
You're free.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.110
(Water sloshing)

39:05.245 --> 39:06.546
All right.

39:06.581 --> 39:09.614
(Breathing heavily)

39:09.649 --> 39:11.049
(Shouts)

39:18.791 --> 39:21.056
(Groans)

39:21.091 --> 39:23.625
Robeson, over here!

39:23.659 --> 39:25.593
Robeson, I need help!

39:25.627 --> 39:27.993
(Groans)

39:39.501 --> 39:42.941
(Panting)

39:55.798 --> 39:57.567
There!

39:57.601 --> 39:58.835
SOLDIER:
Stand still!

39:58.870 --> 40:01.907
Wait, no. No, no, wait, wait.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.307
Wait, no, no.
Wait, you've got the wrong...

40:03.342 --> 40:05.274
(Groans)

40:05.307 --> 40:07.174
I've been mugged.

40:07.208 --> 40:09.277
And now you'll be hanged.

40:20.423 --> 40:23.759
We found him wandering.
Looks like he's been in a fight.

40:23.793 --> 40:25.361
Abraham, where have you been?

40:25.396 --> 40:26.696
I've been looking all over for you.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.230
We'll ask the questions, Judge.

40:28.264 --> 40:29.963
I will ask the questions.

40:29.997 --> 40:32.731
Captain Joyce was found
murdered this Tuesday morning,

40:32.765 --> 40:34.596
and you have been missing
since... since...

40:34.631 --> 40:37.934
Since Monday evening
when he was released.

40:37.969 --> 40:40.805
(Panting)
Captain Joyce is dead?

40:40.839 --> 40:42.526
Where were you?

40:46.043 --> 40:48.544
I was with the enemy, sir.

40:49.290 --> 40:53.612
I set out early Tuesday with a
cargo of cabbage from my field.

40:55.014 --> 40:57.281
My aim was to barter it
on the London Trade.

40:57.315 --> 41:01.116
And I did so for 12 pound sterling
and a bundle of silk.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.516
On my return home that night,

41:03.551 --> 41:06.556
I was overtaken by a brig
sloop just off the coast.

41:07.409 --> 41:10.727
The crew claimed that I'd defied
the authority of Congress

41:10.761 --> 41:12.765
and their justice was to rob me

41:12.931 --> 41:14.867
and beat me and throw me
overboard, sir.

41:14.901 --> 41:17.684
It seems like they also
robbed you of any proof

41:17.809 --> 41:19.870
of your tragic tale.

41:24.675 --> 41:27.077
I concealed it before
they boarded my scow.

41:28.680 --> 41:32.050
- The money they took.
- Damn bloody fool!

41:32.085 --> 41:34.853
Given to greed and
deserved what you got.

41:34.887 --> 41:38.154
Sir, marked dispatch
just arrived for you.

41:38.189 --> 41:40.791
Did you note the identity
of the assailants?

41:40.825 --> 41:43.292
I know some of them, sir,
but it was very dark...

41:43.326 --> 41:45.597
Smuggling is a crime,
and you will answer for it,

41:45.631 --> 41:48.332
but more pressing are the
activities of these privateers.

41:48.366 --> 41:50.530
Major...
(Whispers)

41:50.655 --> 41:53.773
Yes, return to your home,
see to your family,

41:53.807 --> 41:55.673
and then report
to your father's at 7:00,

41:55.708 --> 41:57.908
and there we'll discuss
names and other details.

41:57.942 --> 42:00.979
Captain, escort
Mr. Woodhull from the fort

42:01.013 --> 42:02.782
unmolested.

42:02.816 --> 42:04.748
Yes, sir.

42:23.535 --> 42:25.435
Just because
you confessed to smuggling

42:25.469 --> 42:27.870
doesn't give you an alibi for Joyce.

42:27.904 --> 42:30.107
I've never killed anyone.

42:30.232 --> 42:33.140
I have. Plenty just like you.

42:33.175 --> 42:36.109
You may have fooled the major,
but not me.

42:42.512 --> 42:44.612
Travel safe!

43:14.973 --> 43:17.206
(Gasps)

43:17.241 --> 43:18.775
What are you doing here?

43:18.809 --> 43:20.611
Giving you this.

43:20.645 --> 43:22.179
It's what I owe Selah.

43:22.214 --> 43:23.983
You can use it to buy his parole.

43:25.454 --> 43:27.522
- What happened?
- I have to go.

43:27.557 --> 43:30.590
Wait, wait, I can't take this.

43:30.624 --> 43:31.992
- Why not?
- I can't take this.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.761
- Why?
- He'll find it.

43:33.795 --> 43:35.498
Who?

43:39.505 --> 43:41.037
Simcoe.

43:41.072 --> 43:43.174
The Welshman.

43:43.208 --> 43:46.443
- The one who put a pistol to your head.
- Yeah. I know of him.

43:46.477 --> 43:49.813
- He's being billeted here and...
- What's he done to you?

43:49.848 --> 43:52.185
- Has he touched you?
- He...

43:55.087 --> 43:58.422
I hear him outside my door at night.

43:58.456 --> 44:01.190
And he's been in my room when
I haven't, I'm certain of it.

44:01.224 --> 44:04.096
And if he finds I'm hiding silver
you took off a dead soldier...

44:04.131 --> 44:06.264
Wait, what?

44:06.298 --> 44:09.765
You think I killed Captain Joyce?
You believe that?

44:09.800 --> 44:12.369
You know me.
I didn't kill anyone.

44:14.371 --> 44:17.873
What soldier do you know of that
carries 12 pounds sterling on his person?

44:17.908 --> 44:19.675
- Tell me that.
- None.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.578
And no farmer, either.
Where did you get it?

44:21.612 --> 44:24.547
- (Door creaks)
- Come here, come here.

44:27.185 --> 44:29.856
Look, I had to trade some goods.

44:29.891 --> 44:32.526
Caleb Brewster is running a shop out
of his whale boat on Devil's Belt.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.428
- I had to trade with him.
- Caleb?

44:35.463 --> 44:37.197
You saw him? How is he?

44:37.231 --> 44:38.999
He's the same as ever.

44:39.034 --> 44:41.669
He's unshaven, he's insane.

44:41.703 --> 44:44.339
(Chuckles)

44:44.374 --> 44:46.406
I saw Ben Tallmadge, too.

44:46.441 --> 44:48.642
What? You saw him?

44:48.676 --> 44:51.046
- They were together?
- No, no.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.615
Ben is a...

44:52.649 --> 44:55.049
he's a Connecticut Dragoon now.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.517
He's got a shiny helmet and all.

44:59.054 --> 45:01.957
He tried to recruit me
for a secret mission.

45:01.991 --> 45:04.523
- Against the British?
- Don't worry, I won't do it.

45:04.557 --> 45:06.760
Why not?

45:09.532 --> 45:11.734
What are you waiting for?

45:13.640 --> 45:16.208
What more do they need
to take from us?

45:16.243 --> 45:19.510
- (Jingles)
- Anna.

45:19.545 --> 45:21.580
Anna?

45:27.885 --> 45:30.289
(Coins jingle)

45:40.703 --> 45:44.637
Whatever you're doing, don't.

45:46.007 --> 45:48.143
We can't afford to lose you.

45:52.445 --> 45:54.614
We?

45:56.918 --> 45:59.322
I can't.

46:09.820 --> 46:12.121
HEWLETT:
Excellent, as always.

46:12.156 --> 46:13.623
Credit goes to Aberdeen.

46:13.658 --> 46:16.458
I merely raise the pork.
She performs the alchemy.

46:17.559 --> 46:20.493
You've hardly touched yours.

46:21.265 --> 46:24.364
It's hard to eat
on a guilty stomach, I suppose.

46:24.399 --> 46:25.703
My apologies.

46:28.334 --> 46:31.001
Abraham, what I could not
say earlier

46:31.035 --> 46:34.303
from my pulpit, as it were,

46:34.337 --> 46:36.806
is that I view your crime
as a mere symptom

46:36.840 --> 46:39.009
of a more serious disease

46:39.043 --> 46:41.176
that is afflicting these colonies...

46:41.210 --> 46:43.645
- Anarchy.
- You mean self-rule.

46:43.680 --> 46:47.049
I mean chaos masquerading as freedom.

46:47.083 --> 46:50.082
An excuse for criminal activity
and every man for himself.

46:50.117 --> 46:52.487
Well said. If these upstarts

46:52.522 --> 46:54.491
were truly concerned
with your liberty,

46:54.525 --> 46:56.526
they wouldn't encourage
smuggling on the one hand

46:56.561 --> 46:58.529
and then roll you on the other.

46:58.563 --> 47:01.201
So, we all must pay a tax.

47:01.236 --> 47:04.272
The question is just who will collect?

47:07.541 --> 47:10.808
"Oh, God, that one might
read the book of fate"

47:10.842 --> 47:13.910
and see the revolution of the times

47:13.945 --> 47:15.979
make mountains level.

47:16.013 --> 47:19.150
"And the continent,
weary of solid firmness..."

47:19.183 --> 47:22.184
BOTH:
"...melt itself into the sea."

47:22.219 --> 47:25.053
Ah, your father is the only man
that I can find here

47:25.088 --> 47:27.021
with an affection for the humanities.

47:27.055 --> 47:29.225
Did you pass your trivium
onto your son?

47:29.259 --> 47:31.197
No, man is above the law.

47:31.231 --> 47:34.801
That is what you taught me,
and I will gladly accept

47:34.836 --> 47:37.405
whatever punishment you deem
fit for my forgetting it.

47:37.439 --> 47:40.006
I doubt you can afford
to pay the fine.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.138
(Sighs) It pains me to
recommend imprisonment,

47:43.171 --> 47:44.903
but we must have no favorites.

47:46.140 --> 47:50.308
Ahem, there may be a temporary salve.

47:50.343 --> 47:53.914
His Majesty has decreed that
any of his errant subjects

47:53.948 --> 47:56.216
may be forgiven their transgressions

47:56.250 --> 47:58.551
if they pledge an oath...

47:58.585 --> 48:00.822
- An oath of loyalty, yes.
- Yes.

48:00.856 --> 48:02.492
That is ideal.

48:02.527 --> 48:04.160
It's a public oath and...

48:04.195 --> 48:05.761
- (Snaps)
- Paper.

48:05.795 --> 48:07.730
When it becomes clear
that your cooperation

48:07.765 --> 48:09.099
assisted in the capture of the enemy,

48:09.134 --> 48:11.306
then any doubt will be put to rest.

48:17.945 --> 48:19.747
Sir?

48:19.782 --> 48:24.515
The names of the men
who attacked you, remember?

48:27.120 --> 48:29.754
Yes, ahem.

48:29.789 --> 48:34.361
The, um... They were boys
from Hempstead.

48:34.396 --> 48:36.698
- Presbyterians.
- Mm.

48:36.732 --> 48:38.834
Their names were

48:38.868 --> 48:41.671
Daniel Taylor,

48:41.705 --> 48:44.008
William Washburn,

48:44.042 --> 48:46.911
Matthew Mitchell.

48:46.945 --> 48:50.980
And then there was
another one called Simon.

48:51.014 --> 48:54.952
Didn't catch his family name,
but he was a fat one.

48:54.986 --> 48:58.958
He was mean, with his head
shaved to the scalp.

48:58.993 --> 49:02.332
HEWLETT:
Excellent.

49:02.366 --> 49:05.500
I shall pass this on to Captain Simcoe

49:05.535 --> 49:08.840
with instructions that if he should
encounter any of these men on his raid,

49:08.874 --> 49:12.078
- he will give them no quarter.
- Raid?

49:13.947 --> 49:18.313
The dispatch that I received
today was from York City.

49:18.347 --> 49:21.649
It's intelligence regarding a
rebel safe house across the Sound

49:21.684 --> 49:23.984
where they're launching
their strikes from.

49:26.052 --> 49:28.921
We'll cross at night,
just like your attackers.

49:28.955 --> 49:31.522
(Muted)
Silent approach,

49:31.556 --> 49:33.758
bayonets fixed.

49:33.792 --> 49:36.362
Give them their own medicine.

49:37.497 --> 49:39.929
RICHARD:
Are you all right, son?

49:39.963 --> 49:42.999
Not feeling true?

49:44.468 --> 49:46.569
Oh, you must be exhausted.

49:46.603 --> 49:48.536
Why don't you off to bed?

49:48.571 --> 49:52.139
Yes. Please excuse me.

49:58.109 --> 50:00.412
(Door opens)

50:29.781 --> 50:31.782
(Figurines clatter)

50:40.727 --> 50:44.061
(Faint chatter)

51:22.689 --> 51:24.530
ANDRE'S VOICE:
"You will have heard, dear sir,"

51:24.554 --> 51:26.390
I doubt not long before this
can have reached you

51:26.424 --> 51:28.393
that the rebels have been
routed from Harlem

51:28.427 --> 51:30.926
and the whole house of York Island
has been made safe

51:30.961 --> 51:32.294
from further harassment."

51:32.328 --> 51:35.765
Harlem? This is ancient news.

51:35.800 --> 51:39.001
- (Bell rings)
- HEWLETT: Aberdeen.

51:46.894 --> 51:49.494
ANDRE'S VOICE: "I harbor no doubt
that we will seize high command"

51:49.518 --> 51:51.954
before winter sets in."

51:55.391 --> 51:57.794
"Rebels' safe house. Connecticut,

51:57.828 --> 52:01.365
Meigs Harbor. Show no quarter."

52:09.943 --> 52:12.412
(Soldiers cheering, chattering)

52:14.783 --> 52:18.483
<i>â™ª I don't want to go to war â™ª</i>

52:18.517 --> 52:21.119
<i>â™ª I'd rather stay at home â™ª</i>

52:21.153 --> 52:23.655
<i>â™ª Around the streets to roam â™ª</i>

52:23.689 --> 52:27.488
<i>â™ª And live on the earnings
of a highborn whore... â™ª</i>

52:27.522 --> 52:29.856
(Faint singing continues)

52:32.357 --> 52:34.525
(Muffled yell)

52:34.559 --> 52:36.593
You only have a few moments,
so I must be quick and clear

52:36.627 --> 52:38.561
and you must hear every word.

52:40.496 --> 52:43.831
I think I might've found a way to
rid ourselves of Captain Simcoe.

52:43.866 --> 52:45.535
- Simcoe?
- Yes.

52:45.569 --> 52:47.102
He's upstairs. Are you insane?

52:47.135 --> 52:49.535
But no one will know we're involved.

52:49.569 --> 52:53.002
Ben Tallmadge has devised a way
so we can signal him in secret.

52:53.036 --> 52:54.937
Ben? He's coming here?

52:54.971 --> 52:57.438
No, he'll send a courier.

52:57.472 --> 52:59.439
We'll meet in one of the
coves along the bay

52:59.474 --> 53:01.507
and you will signal him which one.

53:01.542 --> 53:03.275
I will?

53:03.310 --> 53:05.910
Yes, your home backs onto the water.

53:05.945 --> 53:09.646
When you hang a black
petticoat from your peg line,

53:09.681 --> 53:11.280
they'll know when I'm ready to meet.

53:11.315 --> 53:14.816
- Black petticoat.
- Look, it's not my plan.

53:14.851 --> 53:17.321
It's some idea of Ben's with...

53:17.355 --> 53:20.125
with General Washington,
but it's how we get Simcoe.

53:20.159 --> 53:22.794
(Footsteps descending stairs)

53:22.828 --> 53:24.461
Need any help down here?

53:24.495 --> 53:28.299
Uh, yes, thank you.
A bit heavy for me.

53:34.909 --> 53:37.178
Barrel.

53:37.212 --> 53:39.314
"Over a barrel."

53:39.349 --> 53:43.417
(Simcoe chuckles)
You know what saying I fancy?

53:44.721 --> 53:47.324
"Over a barrel."

53:49.392 --> 53:51.827
Do you like that one?

53:51.861 --> 53:55.000
- Your men are thirsty.
- They can wait.

53:56.336 --> 54:00.271
They do what I tell them to do...

54:01.573 --> 54:04.040
because they know
what's good for them.

54:09.044 --> 54:11.013
I expect.

54:12.714 --> 54:14.948
You're captain now.

54:14.982 --> 54:19.152
I took note of the
epaulette on your coat.

54:21.787 --> 54:25.554
I'll take special care not to damage it

54:25.588 --> 54:27.524
when I finish your laundry.

54:30.560 --> 54:35.328
I'll hang it myself,
just as you requested.

54:37.063 --> 54:40.031
It'll be waiting
for you Saturday morning.

54:40.065 --> 54:42.936
I'll be gone Saturday.
Back Monday.

54:42.971 --> 54:44.369
Monday, then.

54:44.404 --> 54:49.374
Now, my husband and I
used to lift these together.

54:50.710 --> 54:52.811
Shall we?

54:52.845 --> 54:55.081
No need.

55:07.764 --> 55:09.765
(Knife clatters)

55:25.676 --> 55:27.807
What she doin'?

55:44.871 --> 55:46.472
(Blade rings)

55:49.675 --> 55:51.141
Quicker this time, huh?

55:51.176 --> 55:54.078
Oh, Jesus, Caleb.
What are you doing here?

55:54.112 --> 55:57.181
How's about you lower
the butter knife first?

56:01.554 --> 56:03.191
- What of Ben?
- Huh?

56:03.226 --> 56:05.061
Ben Tallmadge, did he catch you?

56:05.095 --> 56:07.695
- Did he find you?
- He didn't find me.

56:07.730 --> 56:09.065
We found you.

56:09.099 --> 56:10.869
What?

56:10.903 --> 56:12.771
We found you.

56:15.607 --> 56:18.144
- You?
- Yeah.

56:18.179 --> 56:20.983
- You're the courier?
- That's right, now he gets it.

56:21.017 --> 56:23.686
But we... back at Frog's Point...

56:23.720 --> 56:26.553
Yeah, that was the first interview.

56:26.587 --> 56:28.655
The second was with Ben.

56:28.689 --> 56:31.861
You passed muster when you
refused to give up my name.

56:31.895 --> 56:34.832
Just want you to know
I was very touched by that.

56:34.867 --> 56:36.801
You set me up?

56:38.005 --> 56:39.975
You bastard!

56:42.047 --> 56:44.015
Get off! Get off!

56:46.153 --> 56:47.856
I'm Second Company,
Fourth Battalion,

56:47.890 --> 56:49.959
New York Regiment, all right?

56:49.994 --> 56:53.026
I'm assigned to Captain Tallmadge
for special detail.

56:54.629 --> 56:57.332
Anything you give me
goes straight to Ben.

56:59.233 --> 57:01.267
- Who else knows my name?
- No one.

57:01.301 --> 57:03.035
Speak true!
Who else knows my name?

57:03.070 --> 57:05.973
No one.

57:06.008 --> 57:07.776
Get off.

57:10.314 --> 57:11.716
Or hers!

57:19.694 --> 57:22.693
Now, she put a petticoat
on that line for a reason.

57:22.727 --> 57:24.726
What?

57:26.530 --> 57:30.097
I think you know something, Abe.

57:30.132 --> 57:32.333
I think you wanna tell me.

57:32.367 --> 57:35.503
Huh?

57:35.538 --> 57:38.539
Come here.

57:38.573 --> 57:41.944
You get a taste for boiling these
lobsters and you'll want more.

57:41.979 --> 57:45.447
Yeah? And once I pass this up
the ladder, they'll want more.

57:45.481 --> 57:48.985
Washington's been trying to get a man
inside the city since Howe took it over.

57:49.019 --> 57:52.555
Well, he'll have to find
someone else, then, won't he?

57:52.589 --> 57:54.390
This was a onetime deal for me.

57:54.425 --> 57:56.610
Just like the last one?

58:01.097 --> 58:03.699
Are you gonna tell me
what you know or not?

58:13.245 --> 58:16.579
I, Abraham Woodhull,
do sincerely...

58:16.613 --> 58:18.514
Louder.

58:24.254 --> 58:27.088
(Loudly)
I, Abraham Woodhull...

58:29.355 --> 58:33.958
do sincerely and faithfully
promise and swear

58:35.142 --> 58:40.277
that I will bear true allegiance
to His Majesty, King George III.

58:44.068 --> 58:46.646
And that, with heart and hands,

58:47.870 --> 58:49.773
life and goods...

58:52.341 --> 58:55.877
will maintain and defend
His Majesty's government...

58:59.579 --> 59:01.548
Get ready.

59:01.582 --> 59:03.261
Present.

59:04.187 --> 59:06.747
...and the laws of the
province of New York...

59:06.782 --> 59:08.180
SIMCOE:
Fire!

59:10.349 --> 59:12.418
...against all traitorous conspiracies...

59:12.453 --> 59:15.790
- SIMCOE: Regulars, present...
- ...and attempts...

59:15.824 --> 59:18.592
Fire!

59:18.627 --> 59:20.627
ABE:
...shall be made against his person...

59:20.661 --> 59:22.396
(Shouting)

59:22.430 --> 59:25.068
ABE:
...crown

59:25.103 --> 59:27.304
or dignity.

59:27.339 --> 59:29.740
- (Gunshots)
- (Screaming)

59:31.142 --> 59:34.279
And I will do my utmost endeavor...

59:34.313 --> 59:36.011
(Grunts)

59:36.046 --> 59:39.616
ABE: ...and make known to His Majesty
and his successors...

59:39.650 --> 59:42.220
(Gunfire continues)

59:49.330 --> 59:50.996
Come on!

59:52.564 --> 59:54.799
(Shouting)

01:00:00.275 --> 01:00:04.446
...all treasons
and traitorous conspiracies

01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:08.192
which I shall know to be against,
or any of them.

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:12.852
(Gasping)

01:00:12.886 --> 01:00:14.988
(Groans)

01:00:17.892 --> 01:00:20.726
(Groaning)

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.630
Captain Simcoe?

01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:24.668
Where'd you come from?

01:00:24.702 --> 01:00:27.804
A little place you may have
heard of called Setauket.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:33.740
- God save the King!
- ALL: God save the King.

01:00:33.775 --> 01:00:36.077
(Scattered applause)

01:00:56.529 --> 01:00:58.534
Tie him down.

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:15.479
What's that for?

01:01:16.668 --> 01:01:19.252
I'm sending my best wishes
to Robert Rogers.

01:01:19.287 --> 01:01:22.623
I was half hoping
he'd show up today.

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:25.624
Oi, well done.

01:01:25.659 --> 01:01:27.427
Yeah, you, too.

01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:30.830
This doesn't feel right, Ben.

01:01:30.865 --> 01:01:32.964
Yeah, I know.

01:01:34.334 --> 01:01:36.537
General Scott asked me if I thought

01:01:36.571 --> 01:01:39.138
there was a breach within our ranks.

01:01:39.172 --> 01:01:42.273
I have no better way to explain how
the redcoats even learned about...

01:01:42.307 --> 01:01:45.544
No, Ben, I mean that
Woody came through for us,

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:48.677
and his sole request,
we choose not to honor.

01:01:51.046 --> 01:01:53.149
We will.

01:01:53.183 --> 01:01:56.553
After we pull the truth out of him.

01:01:56.587 --> 01:01:59.951
He might know which friend
is truly our enemy.

01:02:01.686 --> 01:02:03.887
All right, men, let's move out!

01:02:13.601 --> 01:02:15.842
We should collect a five-pound
of flour while we're here.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:18.300
All right, all right.

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:23.371
I thought that you
presented yourself well.

01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:26.341
Thank you, thank you.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.515
I thought this little fella
did awfully well as well.

01:02:30.818 --> 01:02:33.319
- Not so much as a peep.
- Ha, that's my boy.

01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:36.123
That's my boy.
Come here, come here.

01:02:36.158 --> 01:02:38.193
Come here to Daddy. There you go.

01:02:38.227 --> 01:02:39.829
There you go.

01:02:39.863 --> 01:02:42.332
You all right? Huh?

01:02:42.366 --> 01:02:43.767
You like to listen
to your father, Sprout?

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.339
Huh? You like to listen to your father?

01:02:46.374 --> 01:02:48.710
A lost art.

01:02:49.945 --> 01:02:52.278
That was impressive.

01:02:52.313 --> 01:02:54.712
Well, I was very happy to do it.

01:02:54.747 --> 01:02:56.581
Were you?

01:02:59.087 --> 01:03:02.525
There are no boys in
Hempstead with those names.

01:03:04.394 --> 01:03:07.297
- Come again?
- I know you lied.

01:03:13.867 --> 01:03:16.604
Don't try and deny it.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.239
You lied to Major Hewlett in my house,

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:22.845
in front of me.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:25.077
Did you kill Captain Joyce?

01:03:26.471 --> 01:03:28.646
Is that what you believe?

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.945
I don't know what you're hiding,

01:03:30.979 --> 01:03:34.715
but I do know that you will tell me
because you will have no choice.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.617
