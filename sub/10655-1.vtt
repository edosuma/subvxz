SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER IT IS REAL "ABRAHAM LINCOLN - 1903

00:12.160 --> 00:15.747
Welcome to International Financial News. I'm Lindsay Hawthorne.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.646
Die deutsche Hot Bot Corporation

00:20.794 --> 00:25.256
... Is currently running the beta test of a new series of lifelike Sexrobotern

00:25.300 --> 00:27.374
for American consumers.

00:27.445 --> 00:31.696
So far, the Hot Bot Corporation in the United States does not have any patent approval

00:31.740 --> 00:35.433
obtained for the cutting-edge technologies for controlling the robot.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.500
However, the hot-Bot Manager hope the Congress in the coming months

00:38.540 --> 00:39.564
to convince.

00:40.265 --> 00:42.338
This is the Hot Bot Corporation,

00:42.380 --> 00:46.311
where soon the pleasure industry is revolutionizing

00:46.360 --> 00:51.716

This is the latest hot-bot prototype.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.841
As you can see,

01:26.900 --> 01:30.788
he looks very lifelike and seductive.

01:30.840 --> 01:35.226
But that's just a robot, not a beautiful young woman.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.596
We call this perfect combination of art and science

01:38.640 --> 01:40.600
In German we have a word for this concept.

01:44.820 --> 01:48.606
I was told that we can interview him ... or her. Is that correct?

01:48.660 --> 01:50.674
Yes, of course, but bear in mind,

01:50.720 --> 01:53.240
it is none of the urgency eloquent models.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.780

For a polymer of space technology provides.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.296
Are you able to feel love?

02:12.340 --> 02:16.323
Yes, but as with humans, the overloading my system.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.345
Analysis of Hot bots always true.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.023
For the spectators and if my wife ... If you watch,

02:45.480 --> 02:48.884
The economic slowdown in Europe

02:49.720 --> 02:51.936
was hard for the economy.

02:51.980 --> 02:54.272
Would you like oral sex?

02:54.320 --> 02:57.051
- We should better stop. - No. Go on.

Willkommen in Salt Lake City.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.713
If we serve the food so hot, we get in trouble.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.873

07:55.320 --> 07:58.275
Greet them one more time, then I miss you a red sock!

07:58.320 --> 07:59.635
- I'm sorry. - My meal!

07:59.680 --> 08:01.678

08:15.200 --> 08:18.696
Why are not you in the batter box? You seem not customer friendly.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.797
No customer will order something,

08:20.840 --> 08:23.241
when he sees you, you failed abortions!

08:23.980 --> 08:24.962
Your shift is over.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.603
Bring out the fucking garbage.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.082
I think fried food makes him aggressive.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.623
What is this, Koontz?

08:50.140 --> 08:52.907
Worth it!

08:56.780 --> 08:57.896
Panda.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.265
And why did not you?

09:00.320 --> 09:04.365
Because I have taken the pill, Frazier, therefore. Do you realize that I ...?

09:06.260 --> 09:09.847
If I still take an hour, I stand up to the day of the tree!

09:09.900 --> 09:12.716
You know what? This is beneath my dignity, I do not.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.354
I want you to find them and herbringst. Bring it easy ...

09:16.400 --> 09:17.382
What did I say?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.251
Git.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.716
Where were we?

09:23.780 --> 09:27.065
Oh yes. So, listen. You have half an hour to heal,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.032
then I use you no matter what.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.836
Do not look at me like that.

09:35.820 --> 09:36.767
Oh Mann.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.177
I was never spanked a sex doll.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.419
Oh my God. I believe...

09:42.660 --> 09:44.816
... It has made me einzuscheißen me.

09:44.860 --> 09:45.945
Good.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.015
We need to find.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.889
What do we do now?

09:52.440 --> 09:54.126
The is a Van Damme with vagina.

09:55.880 --> 10:00.832
"A so-called red sock arises when during unprotected anal intercourse

10:00.880 --> 10:03.477
the internal tissue of the intestine from the body occurs,

10:03.720 --> 10:06.145
because this then strongly a red Kneesock similar. "

10:08.020 --> 10:12.040
He knows that he is just at its peak. He knows, you know?

10:12.080 --> 10:16.047
He also stupid, he knows that these are the best years of his life.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.350
And the worst of our lives. Do you know why?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.081
We can laugh about it,

10:20.140 --> 10:24.482
when we are sitting on mountains of money we earn, because we are so smart.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.286
And you he hates.

10:26.340 --> 10:29.794
He would like to miss two confident a pair of socks.

10:29.840 --> 10:33.517
The non attracts me the asshole from the asshole. OK?

10:45.980 --> 10:46.903
Crap!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.142
We have approached what.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.217
- What? - I do not know.

10:54.260 --> 10:57.154
Well, "I do not know" is under your car.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.327
Why do not you see to what it is?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.928
Approx. I.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.402
I love you not ask, you idiot.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.838
What is it?

11:22.500 --> 11:26.980
Nard, we might have to deal with a half-dead, angry Bock,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.286
he seems to be really mad at me and could I

11:29.340 --> 11:31.257
equal to drill its horn in the neck.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.458
- Do not be a moron. - Ok, I'm just saying

11:34.500 --> 11:38.228
that it is difficult to talk to you when I sprayed blood from the neck.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.514
It is already difficult enough to communicate with you.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.476
Come on, dude, that's boring.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.232
Do you see something?

11:52.220 --> 11:53.270
What is?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.375
Nard! Nard!

11:56.420 --> 11:59.249
- What is? - Age! You've hit a woman!

11:59.300 --> 12:01.216
And all of clothes ripped off!

12:01.260 --> 12:03.560
We have to wrap it and put into the car.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.182
Have I blown away?

12:05.240 --> 12:07.420
You can not like a dead animal here blank.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.494
Outside it's cold, Huffy. I do not want to get out.

12:10.540 --> 12:13.897
- I'm so cold. - Climbing immediately from the fucking car!

12:13.940 --> 12:16.367
You know, I'm cold so easily.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.360
Ok.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.032
I do not do...

12:21.880 --> 12:24.440
I have to report. Did you here a network?

12:24.480 --> 12:26.311
We have no reception.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.173
Well, we seek.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.139
Huffy?

12:32.200 --> 12:34.052
We just need a plan, okay?

12:34.960 --> 12:37.354
You mean to report the accident to police

12:37.400 --> 12:40.491
is the wrong decision?

12:40.540 --> 12:44.652
I just know that I'm old enough to know that we are too young,

12:44.880 --> 12:45.957
To make the right decision.

12:47.100 --> 12:47.990
Ok.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.530
And what is the wrong decision,

12:51.580 --> 12:53.473
- Which I will support? - OK that...

12:54.380 --> 12:56.940
Is complex. I'm telling you, when we are with you.

12:56.980 --> 12:59.877
I do not know if she is still alive. My parents may see the corpse.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.513
You will not see her body.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.607
That's part of the plan.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.880
Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.546
- I do. - You trust the plan?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.484
- I trust the plan. - Tell me.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.587
I trust the man behind the plan and the plan.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.091
OK. If you trust the man behind the plan,

13:14.140 --> 13:15.489
you trust and the plan.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.621
You trust the plan.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.927
I do.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.432
Ok.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.438
Why do not you in the garage?

13:33.220 --> 13:34.099
Why?

13:34.160 --> 13:36.317
Because we are in there to stash the girl.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.580
to come to this idea took more than an hour?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.540
Come on.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.384
So, where to now? In your room?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.949
- I ... - Yes, in my room.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.391
Since no one would ever suspect a woman.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.709
OK. Thats really sad. Do not say such things.

13:56.140 --> 13:57.127
And now back again.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.429
Right this way.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.467
Shit.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.172
What is going to shit music?

14:08.020 --> 14:09.376
- What's going on there? - Stay where you are.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.309
Ok, now fast.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.280
Ok, one, two, three.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.197
Please, God, let me get away on a technicality.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.366
For a woman who is damn hard.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.200
The weighs more than a weekend shopping trip.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.500
- Hey, Limus, Leonard, what are you doing? - Crap.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.707

14:48.060 --> 14:51.320
- Nothing. Well, something. - Nothing. Well, something.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.281
You smell funny.

14:52.740 --> 14:54.526
Ja. War stinklangweilig.

14:55.580 --> 14:58.339
Whatever you have brought into my house, tomorrow it's gone.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.426
- Roger that. - Yes, sir.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.263
- See you later. - Bye.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.598
No. Do not touch.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.282
- I wonder ... - What he had on the jacket there?

15:15.160 --> 15:16.038
Was?

15:17.220 --> 15:23.398
I ... I've calculated how long we will sit for it.

15:24.060 --> 15:26.157
Ok, it's still unconscious.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.460
We still have a few hours to think about ...

15:28.500 --> 15:31.629
before it begins to stink. We will sort it out.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.265
Because my plan is something of awesome.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.232
You know what? I would relax, Huffy.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.721
You have for the first time in life a woman in your bed.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.781
Dead or alive, which is quite an improvement.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.445
Baby, do not you think, Leonard should go slow?

15:47.500 --> 15:48.372
Ok, Mom.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.553
And I want you bathe today.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.586
Thank Mrs. Huffington.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.062
Ok, I'll let you two alone now.

15:59.060 --> 16:02.594
Hey. Hey, are you coming tomorrow forth early and help me with it.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.459
OK. I know where we bury them.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.062
In Grandmother's Garden.

16:06.700 --> 16:08.699
Oh, you should have sex with her.

16:08.740 --> 16:12.670
Do everything which you know that you must never do it again.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.340
Plug her finger in the ass, lick her eyeball.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.675
I tell anyone, I promise. Ok, I'm just saying.

16:17.720 --> 16:21.479
It's only one night. Dare you fuck the brain from the body.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.550
If you need anything, do not call, I do not want to come.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.633
Hey, Mrs. Huffington, you have a ground beef rolls for me?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.158
Crap!

16:44.340 --> 16:46.500
Hi, I'm Danny. How can I help you?

16:46.540 --> 16:50.598
Your robot has just spanked me and then beaten in the bushes.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.679
Oh. Yes, no, very funny.

16:54.660 --> 16:58.471
The stupid idiot asks me if I'd touched the sex doll immoral.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.111
Did you?

17:04.460 --> 17:06.720
Why must proclaim with us the message Limus never?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.127
Him the Lord else has imposed treasure.

17:09.180 --> 17:10.862
If, otherwise we'll be late.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.275
- And I know how you hate that, honey. - I do.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.204
God does not want us to be late.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.646
- What is? - Nard.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.652
- It is no longer there. - What?

18:09.340 --> 18:11.223
The dead girl's gone!

18:12.460 --> 18:14.461
Dominated a knife out of your chest?

18:15.780 --> 18:17.457
- No. - Well then everything is all right.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.230
Yes, we just hang over the city on posters,

18:20.280 --> 18:21.590
that we are looking for a zombie.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.400
- A zombie?
 - Yes.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.430
A naked zombie.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.328
Toll, Nard, toll.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.949
Search du mal from the house, I build the tent here.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.549
Yes ... I do not hear you.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.573
Good morning World!

19:02.960 --> 19:05.618
- Who's there?! - It's me, Britney, bitch.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.480
Hey, where is she?

19:18.760 --> 19:21.974
I think the ... The zombie is in the bathroom.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.552
Ok.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.645
Crap. Fucking shit.

19:35.620 --> 19:38.015
I really wonder, to go back to church.

19:38.260 --> 19:43.010
Yes, well ... In a minute or two you meet your Creator, my friend.

19:44.900 --> 19:45.775
Huff?

19:46.860 --> 19:47.743
I love you.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.713
I love you too.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.316
Come on, take on the thing.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.884
Okay.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.421
Crap.

19:58.880 --> 19:59.991
Mist!

20:01.540 --> 20:02.963
Why are you doing this to me?

20:04.940 --> 20:05.996
Fang to pray.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.749
Oh, you're awake. Good Morning. Would you fuck in your room?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.416
TEST PERIOD ENDS NOW!

20:21.740 --> 20:22.876
Have you committed to helping protect?

20:22.940 --> 20:24.486
THE PERISKOP WILL BE SUBMARINE SAVE!

20:32.940 --> 20:33.823
Huffy?

20:34.540 --> 20:35.487
Look in your pants.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.008
- Why? - Because you're just arrived.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.333
Hello.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.477
So which one of you wants to fuck me first?

20:47.520 --> 20:48.606
Was?

20:51.320 --> 20:53.045
If one of you undress?

20:53.100 --> 20:56.019
Or should I do for you?

20:56.060 --> 20:58.520
- Huffy, undressed. - Oh man!

20:58.560 --> 21:01.591
- Huffy, undressed. - Shut up! Not so fast.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.888
Come sit next to me.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.734
Age, go already and fuck them.

21:09.820 --> 21:12.141
- While you watch me? - Yes of course.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.538
- Raus, Nard! You can not watch! - Why not?

21:14.580 --> 21:16.471
I'd be seeing you.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.640
If you watch, I do not bring it.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.152
Bring? Do you think this about the Olympics?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.991
You're like a shotgun. One shot, that's it.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.854
Get out, damn it.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.387
Are you a cartoon dog?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.122
Asshole!

21:39.480 --> 21:41.469
I'll have sex with a woman.

21:44.820 --> 21:47.043
Hang you around. You're a bit naked.

21:52.420 --> 21:56.470
So ... How can I prepare for thee pleasure, my lord?

22:00.960 --> 22:06.090
I feel ... That you ... happy little

22:06.140 --> 22:07.791

22:09.100 --> 22:10.828
Missionarsstellung...

22:11.500 --> 22:12.658

22:13.140 --> 22:14.424
... Wiener Auster ...

22:14.480 --> 22:16.032

22:17.480 --> 22:23.079
How charming. Want to lay next to me you just?

22:24.060 --> 22:26.978
How about when you turn on me?

22:27.020 --> 22:28.814

22:43.000 --> 22:44.522
Oh God.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.960
Shit, hurry.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.599
Hey.

22:57.460 --> 22:58.570
Everything OK?

23:03.500 --> 23:04.205
Hello?

23:05.160 --> 23:06.817
- Nard! - What? Crap.

23:08.140 --> 23:09.917
I knew it, she is obsessed! What was going on?

23:09.960 --> 23:12.056
No idea. I did not even to kiss her.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.185
Was?

23:15.780 --> 23:18.129
Well, this time you've really broken it, dude.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.234
I do not know what happened. She is not...

23:21.040 --> 23:22.936
- Alive? - No she is not...

23:24.820 --> 23:25.758
...really.

23:25.820 --> 23:26.831
Was?

23:28.060 --> 23:29.235
This is a doll.

23:37.620 --> 23:39.548
Holy shit.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.835
Huffy, she's a fucking robot.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.154
Today I am slightly hungover.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.526
And you are stupid.

23:50.640 --> 23:55.700
So you want me to say that $ 500,000 have simply disappeared in the forest?

23:55.740 --> 24:01.141
No one will find it, Senator, and certainly not ... touch.

24:03.260 --> 24:05.312
Let me say it differently, Senator.

24:05.560 --> 24:10.311
If someone finds them and connect, we will know it.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.144
The whole company is on alert.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.685
Listen, I'm not a bad person. I do not kill like.

24:14.740 --> 24:17.296
Sometimes, all it, sure, but usually it is to me.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.290
I want to ... I do not want to kill you.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.259
So we avoid it, and her ...

24:22.580 --> 24:24.801
... Finds them, please. Find them.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.568
I, Senator. I.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.273
I mean, this meeting is over. What do you all mean?

24:37.880 --> 24:39.840
Human. Caroline, I am now taking a drink!

24:39.880 --> 24:42.186
And do not skimp on again when pouring, yes?

24:44.260 --> 24:47.128
I do not know, Nard. More I have not found.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.615
The label was Faith Hill Collection.

24:49.660 --> 24:52.365
Yes, actually it is there Salvation Army.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.091
Keep your mouth shut. These are the clothes my mom.

24:55.140 --> 24:57.601
If I knew how to attract women, I was gay.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.697
Mami Mami jeans are jeans, Huffy.

25:01.980 --> 25:05.217
You tilt ketchup on filet mignon. Bravo!

25:06.640 --> 25:08.776
Ladies want to see their Favorites?

25:09.680 --> 25:11.239
This is a real caveman.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.204
Ok?

25:14.660 --> 25:17.694
Is similar to Peter the Great, which I showed you earlier.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.683
As the scope is different.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.754
And as I also have a pair of adjustable testicles.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.253
The tails can be separated.

25:30.340 --> 25:32.293
- Crap. - Oh my goodness.

25:32.340 --> 25:35.231
- Yes. So you can also ... - Benny!

25:35.280 --> 25:37.900
- Oh, sorry, dude. - Fuck off, Nard, immediately!

25:37.940 --> 25:40.069

Oh, Mrs. Williams.
Das ist Jacks Mom.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.275
No, these are not refurbished Toys.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.703
- Mrs. Williams? - Ladys.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.710
This is Mrs. Williams, age.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.140
Oh, wow, Alter.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.780
- OK. Oh no ... - Get off me!

25:53.820 --> 25:56.119
We found that what you want to see safe.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.831
- We do not come without reason. - This will blow your mind.

26:09.980 --> 26:11.398
Ok, I understand that correctly?

26:11.640 --> 26:14.771
Your they have run over ... You have brought them to you

26:14.820 --> 26:17.449
and the only thing she wanted was to fuck you immediately.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.310
- Yes. I swear. - Yes, just as it was.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.179
And what is now your problem?

26:23.220 --> 26:25.420
She made limp before I could kiss her.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.159
Yes. Sure, in the face.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.449
Since each would wilt.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.722
- Good gracious. - Yes. OK.

26:36.780 --> 26:40.719
- You do not look under the hood. - Take it easy. Seeking their ignition.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.240
Somehow you have this thing can turn yet.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.239
Wi-Fi.

26:57.060 --> 26:58.074
Wi-Fi.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.195
Of course, Wi-Fi.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.283
Wi-Fi, cool!

27:11.440 --> 27:12.488
Congratulation.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.127
You guys are the proud owners

27:15.180 --> 27:18.888
an ultramodern fucking machine with all the extras.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.508
Holy shit!

27:22.820 --> 27:24.844
A King Snake Love!

27:26.280 --> 27:27.400
I hope you read like,

27:27.460 --> 27:29.482
because the sweetness has its own Bible here.

27:29.720 --> 27:33.335
What? Hinged to the leg. Since when are you so religious?

27:34.360 --> 27:38.354
Ok, so much for in-the-forest-run-and-there-die.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.815
- You have found it. - Yes.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.512
A certain Benjamin Benedict gets the same visit us.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.435
His is the Save On Sex.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.509
How to save because during sex?

27:59.360 --> 28:03.780
The more they learn and loves, the human being.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.317
Treat the Hot Bot as you want to be treated.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.018
The more you give, the more you get. "

28:09.040 --> 28:11.563
It reacts super sensitive to any incoming data.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.557
- You will do exactly what we want. - Class.

28:16.780 --> 28:20.431
"Because of their experience, they will gradually develop their own thoughts

28:20.480 --> 28:22.061
and form their own opinions. "

28:22.120 --> 28:23.325
Ok, I find that stupid,

28:23.380 --> 28:25.970
because as soon as she realizes who we are,

28:26.020 --> 28:28.138
is they do not want to sleep with us.

28:28.180 --> 28:29.402
Holy Wichshand.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.987
Huffy, consider your virginity quiet as an emergency.

I do.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.101

28:51.300 --> 28:52.993
- The pussy lips? - Please be quiet.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.563
- OK. - Put it through.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.399

30:03.240 --> 30:05.400

Looking for a place to fuck.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.551
Your Bible is longer than normal.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.061
Because their is more important than the regular Bible.

30:24.660 --> 30:25.952
We need to read this.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.583

30:56.500 --> 30:58.492
Who wants to be fucked?

31:03.200 --> 31:05.265

31:49.160 --> 31:51.412
Nothing will happen unless you want it.

32:01.620 --> 32:02.612
Hey, Pizza.

32:04.140 --> 32:05.417
I ordered no pizza.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.317
That was me.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.628

32:19.440 --> 32:23.462
You have a visitor. Look who we got there?

32:24.160 --> 32:25.534
- Friend. - A girlfriend?

32:25.580 --> 32:27.681
Does your friend have a name?

32:29.560 --> 32:32.680
- Nope. - Well, that sounds pretty exotic.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.705
Is this Chinese?

32:33.760 --> 32:35.582

32:41.440 --> 32:43.526
Mom please. You're really 'ne tail lock.

32:43.580 --> 32:46.529
Limus, for heaven's sake! What did you just say to me?

32:46.580 --> 32:49.511
He said, you prevent his penis from penetrating into my vagina.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.536
Thank you paraphrase "tail lock" for me.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.239
Come here. In earnest? You call me "tail lock"?

32:56.280 --> 32:58.108
Have you lost your mind?

33:00.220 --> 33:01.305
Come along.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.553
This is like our house, just smaller.

33:09.460 --> 33:11.119
Here I can hide.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.325
Here are more Regina Rainbow Ceiling

33:16.380 --> 33:20.329
and there is a care bear-pillow.

33:20.380 --> 33:24.166
Pretty. Is all in here tiny?

33:24.220 --> 33:27.351
No, not everything in here is tiny.

33:28.320 --> 33:31.140
Are there any health limitations, which I have to pay?

33:31.180 --> 33:32.370
Asthma.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.102
I have asthma.

33:34.160 --> 33:38.214
Your blood pressure is 170 to 60. Breathe.

33:38.260 --> 33:41.417
- We conduct to increase blood flow. - I try yes.

33:41.460 --> 33:44.837
But if Dad finds out I rummache the playhouse my sister,

33:46.100 --> 33:48.520
He built me ​​a doghouse and banished me to the garden.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.259
Okay, so the doggy.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.265
Limus, time for supper!

33:54.600 --> 33:55.822
Come and get's you!

33:55.880 --> 33:59.388
I have to go. Take ... Take that.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.505

34:14.840 --> 34:15.846
JUNGFRAU

34:33.179 --> 34:34.635
Where are you going, about the kitchen?

34:37.219 --> 34:40.409
This is really strange. I woke up on the stairs.

34:40.460 --> 34:42.275
Three your ass up here. One...

34:42.320 --> 34:43.841
Luckily you found me.

34:43.900 --> 34:44.840
Two...

35:16.860 --> 35:17.975
Good Morning.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.349
I now need to school.

35:23.260 --> 35:26.876
This afternoon at 15:15 I'm back.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.353
You stay here.

35:30.980 --> 35:32.359
Do not go.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.456
Are you sure that the address is correct?

35:59.500 --> 36:02.359
That said, the technical assistance, 1289 Spiral Way.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.660
Oh God. I think that's the wrong address.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.474
Here there's no sex shop. This is a shopping mall.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.762
Dammit, Gandhi.

36:15.420 --> 36:18.859
- Hey, Snufflehuffagus. - I want to neutralize the pH.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.051
- I simulate the pool. - That you have not yet.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.780
Huffy, look at that, age. This is a real problem.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.951
You bring confusion the chlorine feed.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.620
Oh no! Things that you never need in real life!

36:30.660 --> 36:32.422
Mr. Stupenski.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.062
- Mr. Stupenski.
- Ja, Sir?

36:36.300 --> 36:38.995
Do you want to tell the others in the class,

36:39.040 --> 36:43.056
which just requires exactly your undivided attention?

36:43.280 --> 36:48.371
I just read, like an artificial vagina works.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.679
Interesting. Please, take it away.

36:51.420 --> 36:54.640
- Enlighten us. - OK. Very much.

36:54.680 --> 36:59.750
I worry about the moisture level of the plastic pussy.

36:59.800 --> 37:05.920
Although you can on lubricants such as Astroglide recourse,

37:05.960 --> 37:08.992
on lubricants other manufacturers,

37:09.040 --> 37:12.760
nevertheless, I think that you may

37:12.800 --> 37:14.660
have to replace a cartridge

37:14.700 --> 37:17.734
or anything in the way so that when his penis in ...

37:17.780 --> 37:18.859
Ok, gentlemen.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.592
Let's discuss the more it with rector Burns.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.845
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:38.900 --> 37:42.759
I was just in the area and want to talk to you about Jesus.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.067
Have you ever thought to let the Lord in your heart?

37:49.340 --> 37:53.562
Yes, I know that the personal data, because it is my data.

37:54.780 --> 37:57.574
UTAH!
22CM

37:57.620 --> 37:58.967
You obviously do not understand.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.575
- OK? I need ... - Hey, hey.

38:07.720 --> 38:08.880
Do you see what I see?

38:10.760 --> 38:11.849
Yes, I see.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.961
If you miss again pornographic material on my campus,

38:24.780 --> 38:28.038
you will not just stuck paper in the shredder.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.514
So it feels now already.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.839
What is the Vagina?

38:36.560 --> 38:39.057
Hello, welcome to the Electric Beach. Tanning complacent?

38:40.620 --> 38:41.577
For him, yes.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.069
I stay on the right side, you stay on the left.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.728
Oh God, I love this book.

38:54.780 --> 38:58.217
There are so many good stories in it. That it is essential to have read.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.036
The Bible is God's cookbook.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.209
In it he gives the recipes for life.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.935
What recipes?

39:06.980 --> 39:10.093
For example, I cook for no man before he infects me a ring.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.483
Brother, do not pull me by the hair.

39:16.540 --> 39:18.485
- Even when beating rules. - Yes.

39:18.540 --> 39:21.031
- Where is the bot? - No idea what you're talking.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.693
Not the answer I want to hear.

39:25.740 --> 39:27.997
- Have not you wondered exactly? - Listen carefully.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.133
Between the hardware and software put $ 300,000 of us.

39:31.180 --> 39:32.868
I really do not know where she is.

39:34.080 --> 39:39.708
Here's something to help your memory on the jumps, I see.

39:39.760 --> 39:43.499
We do not want that you choke on a dick.

39:45.100 --> 39:47.894
- I think he does not understand me. - Men.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.178
Oh shit.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.529
We need times seriously entertained.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.854
OK. Let's talk about making out.

39:56.900 --> 40:00.660
- About our relationship. - As has who pressed the wrong button.

40:00.700 --> 40:02.937
- Shaqobi, what are you doing? - Nothing, I just play.

40:05.140 --> 40:08.521
Out. Raus, Shaqobi, out!

40:11.980 --> 40:13.137
Hey, the.

40:14.160 --> 40:17.047
So, what's up?

40:17.100 --> 40:19.580
What do you want? She was in my house when I arrived.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.851
Tell me everything you've told her Shaqobi.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.055
- You I say nothing. - You're welcome.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.284
Sex is sacred.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.751
Ok, well, actually, should be fun sex.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.999
When we first met, you said the same:

40:36.040 --> 40:37.528
"Oh, let's have sex immediately."

40:37.580 --> 40:39.096
And we all agreed.

40:39.140 --> 40:43.974
- Let's stay here please. - Fornication, none of the games of life.

40:44.020 --> 40:47.010
Fornication is the only game in life, baby.

40:47.060 --> 40:51.147
So we put the times and to the side.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.815
- And that definitely ... - fornication ...

40:53.800 --> 40:55.548
And definitely there also.

40:55.600 --> 40:58.888
You stay here, because the same we will repair you.

40:58.940 --> 41:00.084
Shaqobi, Bitte.

41:01.540 --> 41:03.559
That's fucking awesome,

41:03.600 --> 41:08.665
because the bigot in there talking about Jesus

41:08.720 --> 41:11.835
and says she played the last three hours the church!

41:11.880 --> 41:14.971
You have what I love, infected with a virus!

41:15.020 --> 41:18.575
Tell me right now what you said to Bardot,

41:18.620 --> 41:22.078
otherwise I cut on you, let bleed you, throw you in the blender

41:22.120 --> 41:26.116
and I rinse the toilet down, so you can swim with the fish, ok?

41:26.160 --> 41:27.177
I mean serious.

41:27.820 --> 41:28.942
No!

41:29.000 --> 41:31.360
- What? No! That was no answer. - Run, Shaqobi!

41:31.600 --> 41:32.813
That was not the answer!

41:32.860 --> 41:36.343
- Do not hide again in the dryer! - I'll eat you alive!

41:37.680 --> 41:39.829
- Crap! - I can reprogram.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.227
- I do it. - I advise you also.

41:42.080 --> 41:45.969
Otherwise I program my rights in your face!

41:46.020 --> 41:47.636
Do not let me just stand so!

41:49.580 --> 41:51.745
Do you believe in holy matrimony?

41:53.880 --> 41:54.933
I forgot how to breathe.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.893
Why do you have to watch Nard if I ask you this?

41:58.600 --> 42:01.180
I try to find out where this question comes.

42:01.220 --> 42:03.319
Do not you like what you see?

42:03.360 --> 42:06.066
But. I like it.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.806
If you like it, you should have infected me a ring.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.092
I have to go.

42:15.740 --> 42:18.984
You know, the thing is, the girl in Deep Throat

42:20.620 --> 42:23.417
has back of the throat a clitoris.

42:23.660 --> 42:26.116
Yes. I think that's why one has accused Nixon.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.216
If we call him Tricky Dick why?

42:31.900 --> 42:34.796
Mouth.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.784
- Also Na. And. - And.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.425
- Eat! - You know now where she is?

42:39.660 --> 42:40.683
Yes, you know it? OK.

42:42.780 --> 42:44.022
How was that like?

42:47.100 --> 42:48.726
- Where is she? - Verpisst you.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.361
Ok.

42:50.420 --> 42:52.969

42:56.160 --> 42:58.447

43:03.960 --> 43:07.232
Yes. We need all the information about a Limus Huffington.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.446
Everything.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.430
You should you really buy a diamond ring.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.929
It is impossible, they confirmed yet only.

43:19.980 --> 43:22.132
Kriegt them a ring, she thinks sex would have to ok.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.945
After all that's will probably never be ok to have sex with her.

43:26.340 --> 43:28.003
Can I get a pretzel?

43:28.780 --> 43:29.997
Two pretzels.

43:30.060 --> 43:31.404
- A birthday cake. - And a Blue.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.175
- There are birthday cakes. - The blue.

Plays basketball somewhere.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.801
- Hey. - Crap.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.338
Rodney plays with Bardot.

44:08.860 --> 44:10.913
Are you her babysitter? Is that it?

44:10.960 --> 44:13.816
If they are good, then you fuck them or ...?

44:13.860 --> 44:15.855
But the body is not fornication,

44:16.440 --> 44:19.120
but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.258
- Corinthians 6:13. - Sorry, it belongs to us, Rodney.

44:22.300 --> 44:24.431
Age, calm down. You just have to ...

44:25.040 --> 44:27.830
The guy is still high euro table. Or am I wrong?

44:27.880 --> 44:31.434

45:01.880 --> 45:05.300
He wants to make you that his penis is 38 cm long.

45:05.340 --> 45:07.340
These are more than 15th

45:08.320 --> 45:10.873
He is evil. Stay away from him.

Hey, this is Benny.

45:17.200 --> 45:18.473
- Benny! - Benny!

45:18.520 --> 45:22.418
- They want their property back, all right? - What are you talking about?

45:22.460 --> 45:25.602
The FBI has raped me orally, because they thought I would Bardot.

45:25.840 --> 45:28.320
No one is behind Bardot here, you dumbass.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.988
I mean damn serious!

45:30.040 --> 45:32.603
- What's going on?
 - I told them that you have it,

45:32.840 --> 45:35.198
So skin from dear, if you want to keep them.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.434
Ok, you know what they look like?

45:38.480 --> 45:41.237
Two types that you your single egg with pruning shears

45:41.280 --> 45:42.837
want to trim.

45:49.020 --> 45:50.612
The, the, the!

46:14.920 --> 46:17.240
Bardot, I know you want to go to heaven,

46:17.280 --> 46:19.940
but a little navigation help would be good now.

46:19.980 --> 46:22.044
I thought you'd never ask. To the left.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.578
- When? - Now.

46:29.100 --> 46:31.932
- Turn sharp right in 150 m. - OK.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.627
Law does not work. What are you saying?

46:36.500 --> 46:38.895
- I miss the last update. - Oh Crap!

46:38.940 --> 46:39.922
- Crap! - Damn it!

46:46.540 --> 46:47.526
Yes, suspended!

46:47.580 --> 46:49.373
- They're back. - Shit, no!

46:53.360 --> 46:55.247
Bieg links ab, links.

47:14.380 --> 47:15.424
Hold tight!

47:26.320 --> 47:28.718
- I hope you dive into. - What? Why?

47:30.160 --> 47:31.510
Because we the shit up to your neck.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.582
The Senator.

47:40.560 --> 47:41.445
Koontz.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.731
VILLAGE COLONIAL VILLAGE MOTEL
ZIMMER FREI

47:51.340 --> 47:53.234
I am not joking. Yes.

47:53.280 --> 47:54.495
I ... I have a room.

47:54.540 --> 47:56.340
- Let's go. - OK. Cool, man.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.538
Who was that?

48:03.660 --> 48:05.045
What did these men?

48:08.500 --> 48:10.081
They want you.

48:10.140 --> 48:12.023
Me? How so?

48:12.660 --> 48:14.386
What do you want from me?

48:14.440 --> 48:17.160
Do you want me as the same reasons as those men?

48:17.200 --> 48:19.029
No.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.701
- This is something completely different. - How so?

48:22.720 --> 48:23.996
Because I have made you happy.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.680
It is safer if you stay here overnight.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.307
Benny remains with you.

48:37.060 --> 48:38.478
And where are you going?

48:39.220 --> 48:41.014
I have to eat with my family for dinner.

48:41.060 --> 48:42.785
- For real? - Yes.

48:45.300 --> 48:50.124
If I do not go, the ... My last supper.

49:00.420 --> 49:01.464
See you tomorrow.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.370
Benny, take good

49:06.080 --> 49:07.272
Benny, take good

49:10.220 --> 49:11.611
Freaks they still look like that?

49:12.520 --> 49:13.542
And.

49:15.700 --> 49:16.679
- Long day. - Yes.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.649
I think between the downloading of God and the flight in front of FBI

49:22.540 --> 49:24.458
- Are burned through their wires. - Yes.

49:24.500 --> 49:26.460
The will to do not sleep today.

49:26.500 --> 49:30.166
- Do not mind? - Benny, in there is only one bed.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.700
The bed is for Bardot. You sleep in the bathtub.

49:32.740 --> 49:36.172
I know your eggs still produce no glue. My already.

49:36.220 --> 49:38.105
If I have to get rid of what I do that.

49:38.160 --> 49:43.179
Benny when your glue stick our girls approaches,

49:43.220 --> 49:45.448
I cut him off, and glue it to you on the head.

49:45.500 --> 49:48.217
- And I'll stick to the asshole. - Oh really?

49:48.260 --> 49:50.083
- Yes really. - Really, yes.

49:50.140 --> 49:52.355
- Really. - That's not real, you wanker.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.494
Yes, that's Boba Fett not, motherfucker.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.318
Crap!

49:59.380 --> 50:01.299
- Age! Come on! - Benny!

50:03.680 --> 50:05.368
- This is holy ground. - OK.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.743
- Get lost. - OK. I'm already gone.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.340
Bring Huffy home. Your'll be fine.

50:13.380 --> 50:15.785
Come clear age. Suction I care to moms tits.

50:17.620 --> 50:18.771
Trust me, all right?

50:18.820 --> 50:20.714
I understand something about repairing toys.

50:20.760 --> 50:23.529
But nothing of friendship!

50:54.660 --> 50:56.689
I'm going to ask you some questions.

50:58.240 --> 51:01.472
Just relax and answer as simple as you can.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.323
Mind if I smoke?

51:04.380 --> 51:05.590
It does not affect the test.

51:11.520 --> 51:15.438
A good Senator must be an insider and an outsider,

51:15.480 --> 51:17.947
and I am both.

51:18.180 --> 51:21.477
A good senator needs to know when he cry and when to laugh,

51:21.520 --> 51:24.180
and I know that.

51:24.220 --> 51:24.904
That's bullshit.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.635
Caroline, you will rewrite this shit before my appearance, ok?

51:29.640 --> 51:30.512
We will...

51:31.360 --> 51:34.976
Hey! There they are. Look at me, who comes there. All right.

51:36.240 --> 51:39.260
The Limited in Black. Says nothing.

51:39.300 --> 51:41.660
Three days.

51:41.700 --> 51:44.400
Can you then do not do anything right? FBI?

51:44.440 --> 51:46.198
Furzblöde idiots?

51:46.240 --> 51:48.981
Tell me that you know where it is. Nods simple. So?

51:50.620 --> 51:54.276
Help me. Do you know who stole it? That you know that, right?

51:54.320 --> 51:55.506
In a way.

51:56.900 --> 51:58.476
This is a great advance.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.414
Let's go but to him. Bring me back.

52:00.460 --> 52:02.651
Now it would fit. I could also go,

52:02.700 --> 52:04.858
only I know blöderweise not know where she is, right?

52:06.360 --> 52:07.719
Therefore fail governments.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.355
This is delicious, honey.

52:12.400 --> 52:13.827
- Thank you. - Yes, no, Dad?

52:14.680 --> 52:15.922
- Thank Shaqobi. - Delicious.

52:15.980 --> 52:16.925
Sit down.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.738
- Sit down and eat. - Sorry, I'm late.

52:22.780 --> 52:24.608
Sit down and eat.

52:25.460 --> 52:26.469
That's all?

52:27.260 --> 52:30.247
He not in trouble? What if I would say that?

52:30.300 --> 52:33.734
Young lady, when I hear ever tell you that you are late

52:34.760 --> 52:37.954
- And your monthly thing ... - Hey, hey, hey!

52:38.000 --> 52:39.993
No children before you. 39 Roger that?

52:40.240 --> 52:41.482
- Ok.
- 39!

52:41.540 --> 52:44.428
- All right. OK. - Only an education, then a job.

52:44.480 --> 52:45.518
Then you can have a baby.

52:45.580 --> 52:47.931
Until then, I want to hear a word of too late.

52:47.980 --> 52:49.729
Love engaged married.

52:49.780 --> 52:52.513
Only then comes the baby. Do you understand me?

52:53.480 --> 52:56.306
I think that was now a transfer.

52:56.360 --> 52:57.334
I believe.

52:58.380 --> 53:00.540
- I would like to pray. - OK.

53:00.580 --> 53:01.806
Come.

53:02.820 --> 53:03.802
Give Mom's hand.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.880
- No, I do not do. - Take Mamas hand.

53:05.920 --> 53:08.560
I do not like this rebellion. Not at all.

53:10.700 --> 53:12.754
- I ... - No more excuses more.

53:12.800 --> 53:14.486
Son, I'm dead serious.

53:14.540 --> 53:16.461
I do not understand where that comes from.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.654
Facebook.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.300
- This is the Internet. - This is the Internet.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.044
And your PORNOS. Do not think we do not know.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.336
But I do not like this lady in hotpants.

53:28.380 --> 53:29.765
Normally she wears no pants.

53:29.820 --> 53:33.529
That's it! That does not happen again. Come here.

53:35.580 --> 53:37.043
Stop it.

53:48.740 --> 53:51.976
All right, kid. Senator Biter. How are you?

53:52.940 --> 53:54.525
not get up.

53:54.580 --> 53:57.613
I wanted to tell you a bedtime story, but only one word ...

53:58.980 --> 53:59.928
... To the hard sock.

54:02.680 --> 54:06.092
How often have you ... In there hosed?

54:06.320 --> 54:07.433
The not mine.

54:07.480 --> 54:11.347
Do not do that. Clear is yours. We both know.

54:11.400 --> 54:13.716
Do you know what has pained me your age?

54:13.760 --> 54:15.855
Wash or throw away? What do you do?

54:17.360 --> 54:18.448
Depends on...

54:19.640 --> 54:21.458
... If I can find a new one.

54:22.100 --> 54:24.960
I only use single socks.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.792
Now you will laugh the same.

54:26.840 --> 54:29.060
I have done exactly the same thing. In earnest.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.400
I swear to god. Well, how do you think?

54:31.440 --> 54:32.562
You and I, we ...

54:33.880 --> 54:36.380
... Shoot our load in orphaned socks.

54:37.920 --> 54:39.574
As I think of myself at your age.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.479
This brings back memories.

54:48.660 --> 54:52.476
Every day tens of erections. I was ugly, all you like.

54:53.060 --> 54:54.520
Oh yes. Come on.

54:55.360 --> 55:00.462
I always knew that no woman ever ... could satisfy my needs.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.895
What I have done to ...

55:02.940 --> 55:04.764
I put my wiener in a melon.

55:04.820 --> 55:08.037
That you determined not know. But it is absolutely true.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.962
They are placed half an hour into the tube. The melon, not my cock.

55:13.620 --> 55:15.540
Half an hour, and while at 120 degrees.

55:15.580 --> 55:19.166
At 180 you cook it. But that is not served.

55:20.120 --> 55:23.906
Half an hour at 120 degrees. Then you cut in there your hole

55:25.060 --> 55:26.452
and put off.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.454
Tell you what, Limus ...

55:29.640 --> 55:31.525
every time I boarded this melon,

55:31.580 --> 55:34.509
I wondered how well feels a warm vagina.

55:36.120 --> 55:37.193
I still wonder.

55:38.640 --> 55:39.695
Oh yeah.

55:42.540 --> 55:43.565
Bring back Bardot.

55:44.560 --> 55:48.229
No, no, I want you back bring Bardot, Limus, ok?

55:48.460 --> 55:49.939
I know you're doing that for me,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.186
because our conversation went better than I thought.

55:52.420 --> 55:56.118
We are cut from the same wood. I want you to bring them back. Good?

55:56.160 --> 55:58.887
That's the end of the bedtime story.

55:58.940 --> 56:00.720
So you have nothing to worry about.

56:00.760 --> 56:03.839
Bring it tomorrow morning back, ok? In order.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.228
Come on, lie down, sleep now.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.591
I spread yourself to yet.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.669
So. And now go to sleep.

56:15.220 --> 56:16.770
That has never been my dad.

56:20.220 --> 56:22.045
That he did constantly.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.993
Bring her back. Well, how about that?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.117
What about that?

56:35.460 --> 56:37.597
You bring them back. Well, how about that?

56:39.200 --> 56:40.829
You bring them back.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.099
Then it's good for all.

56:51.580 --> 56:54.740
- What should we do? - Lightning fast cunning are.

56:54.780 --> 56:57.546
If until then here and keep your eyes open.

56:57.600 --> 56:59.780
it is thing tomorrow bring you to her.

56:59.820 --> 57:00.843
Then she kills him.

57:02.960 --> 57:03.979
No, wait.

57:04.940 --> 57:06.015
No.

57:08.160 --> 57:10.026
I want to kill him. Bring him to me.

57:11.540 --> 57:12.992
Make no nonsense, you two.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.255
I wanted to fix it,

57:51.320 --> 57:54.036
the only problem is, they do not know that it is a robot.

57:54.080 --> 57:56.839
- What is, she does not know? - You know, Benny. Stop it.

57:56.880 --> 58:00.040
I tell you, they do not know. Maybe she knew it, no idea.

58:00.080 --> 58:01.305
Maybe she is a replicant.

58:02.620 --> 58:05.047
As in Blade Runner. Yes. And died.

58:05.100 --> 58:06.205
- What? - Yes.

58:06.260 --> 58:08.047
- She is perfect. - You can you not say that.

58:08.100 --> 58:09.949
- No one will tell her that. - OK. Take it easy.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.204
I do not think that we tell her. I think we need to do ...

58:14.260 --> 58:16.122
Come down again.

58:16.180 --> 58:17.826
That it certainly says no.

58:18.940 --> 58:20.359
Oh shit.

58:27.120 --> 58:29.714
I really wish we could make ourselves invisible.

58:37.720 --> 58:39.214
Yes. Room 15, please.

58:40.020 --> 58:41.886
Out there must be 40 people, damn.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.990
Hey, my kung fu style is only enough for a dozen guys at once.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.387
We have no chance.

58:48.640 --> 58:51.371
- Then we'll die here together. - You would die for me?

58:51.600 --> 58:54.260
Huffy, honest, I admire your Bonnie and Clyde attitude,

58:54.300 --> 58:56.933
but it sounds totally stupid, if you say what that.

58:56.980 --> 59:00.084
I am bold and she is beautiful. And they will not get them.

59:02.260 --> 59:05.692
Yes, hi, guys. So, we know that you are in there.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.249
So do come out with your hands, ok?

59:10.820 --> 59:11.808
"With raised hands"?

59:13.960 --> 59:15.041
Original.

59:15.100 --> 59:17.086
- We do not give you! - OK. All right.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.143
Relax yourself.

59:18.200 --> 59:20.159
Hey, motherfucker, I'll tell you how it's run.

59:20.840 --> 59:21.885
He wants to talk to you.

59:23.100 --> 59:24.255
He wants to order something.

59:26.680 --> 59:27.349
Hello?

59:27.400 --> 59:30.413
Three large ice cream cones or three cans of coke ...

59:30.640 --> 59:32.800
- Do you want a pizza? - What the...?

59:32.840 --> 59:36.072
And a giant pizza. An extra large pizza.

59:36.120 --> 59:40.040
- What? - This is now a hostage!

59:40.080 --> 59:44.013
- We make demands, they deliver! - So you called Ice in waffle?

59:44.060 --> 59:45.142
- And. - And.

59:46.020 --> 59:49.874
- For real? - That's a cheap last meal.

59:50.940 --> 59:52.214
Also true again.

59:52.260 --> 59:56.484
If they bring us the ice, we do not give them out anyway.

59:56.700 --> 59:58.960
Listen, I understand the romantic feelings

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.090
between you two, but ...

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.091
No no no.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.993
And.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:08.737
How long does it take for to get Coke and pizza, motherfucker?

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.123
OK? Nonsense! It's ultimately not about caviar and filet mignon.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.145
It is enough! I have enough! I'm really pissed off.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.014
Do you know what the plan? They want us to fumigate.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:22.064
The hold out until we give up.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.831
No no no! Mach spoon with Huff. I ran go.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.240
Your "caviar and filet mignon" was a clear statement.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.829
- Yes? - Listen to.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.898
You come out now and bring you your ice,

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.434
or I will send in two minutes all my men purely

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:42.037
and we cut yourselves from your tails!

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.166
Forever!

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.408
We should bring us our ice cream.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.436
Pretty good.

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.907
- And? - And.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.210
The streusel are delicious.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.118
Hirnfrost.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.859
I do not want to go through again.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.060
- Did you get it the plan? - Yes, we have figured him.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.799
- Look at me, you have it figured? - Go and show it to them.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.035
We care remotely for moral support.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.331
Then a beat.

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.472
- I want to be on top. - OK. I choose the mantra.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.809
Come on, people fighting, fighting, fighting! Kung fu fight!

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:21.971
- All right. - Good mantra.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.984
Kung Fu, do not let me down.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.791
Hey, Benny. Give ye us our property back?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:36.548
Benny.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.860
Blow in the throat.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.541
Get out, bastard! Please bang's me properly!

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.400
How long does it take probably until I have you broken your neck?

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.565
As.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.297
Crap!

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.840
Does the name Frazier what?

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.813
- The ... Changes everything. - Yes.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.975
Dramatically.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.822
All right then. we simply climbing through the window in the bathroom.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.816
- Ach Mist!
- Ach Mist!

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.413
Ok.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.420
OK. I'm going to lock me up in my car, so ...

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.035
Do you know Elián González? Me, yes.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.121
Let's go, Bardot.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.456
An unfortunate mustache.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.000
OK. Benny? Look at times at that.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:22.531
- Bye, Benny. - Time to enter, in the "Tetris" style.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.031
Let's go.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.256
- Crap! We must have air, asshole! - Hey!

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.172
That was nice of them.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.917
Thanks for the great air hole, bastard!

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.359
- Let me go. - You have to make any demands.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.161
Oh, and who says so?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.396
What's happening?

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.970
Let me see.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.185
You win? You win!

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.543
DAMAGE = 1500

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.025
- Is she still alive? - Bardot!

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.392
Bardot!

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.500
Near me it's too dangerous for you guys.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.204
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:32.134
Hey!

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.370
Bardot!

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.279
- She is gone. - We are delivered, age.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.916
Bardot! Let me ... Where are you going?

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.269
Where are you going? Bardot!

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.482
Bardot!

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.149
- Ok, ok, ok! - Come on out.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.231
Shall we castrate each other or leave it to the Senator?

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.058
Koontz.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.240
Apparently the bot wants a customer fuck.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.345
I wish all women would tick that.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.290
It is simply gone.

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.452
- Why? - I do not know, but how about that?

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.546
I do for you on, because if Dick sees that you frittierst tears

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.521
you know how this ends.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.493
Show yourself, you bum!

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.531
Your sick little assholes!

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:13.440
- What shoud that? - Yes exactly. She's mine now.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.042
What have you done with her?

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.749
Everything you could not.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.415
Where are you going?

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.250
Asshole!

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.227
Better a love lost than never undergo.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.493
Everything OK?

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.153
I've never felt a pain.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.703
We need to retrieve.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.271
As?

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.308
- Rodneys Party.
- Rodneys Party.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.570
You know the hair around your asshole.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.564
Say goodbye to them.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.261
Did you see that?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.098
Angry.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.804
- Slime! - Hey!

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.177
I have Rodney just caught red-handed

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.571
with this comic doll!

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.280
- What shoud that? - Mist.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.105
- Hey. - My fucking party?

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.318
- You want to rape the robot. - Come here!

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.524
- Your disappears now, damn it! - Oh Crap!

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.159
- We thought everyone would be invited. - No no no!

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.321
Fuck you, guys.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.358
One two...

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.161
Yes, good.

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.581
- You stupid ass. - Leave my boys alone.

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.705
Baby, that was ...

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.874
What are you doing?

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.374
Pick the next time guys at the right size.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.279
Come, boys. I drive.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.935
She's on our side.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.782
Sweetheart, are you alright?

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.942
Good gracious! You have so many SkyMiles, 500,000!

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.589
That's enough for Kuala Lumpur.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:22.460
- Look at this! - Amount due: $ 76,000?

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.531
What did you buy?

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.571
I do not know. Who rises from Colonial Motel?

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.393
I am not.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:30.508
Colonial Motel. Colonial ... you Look at that.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.511
I think someone has stolen my identity.

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.438
My identity was stolen.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.281
And with whom he is together than you?

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.515
- Colonial Motel. That's a ... - Baby, I do not fuck around.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.908
I do not fuck around.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.956
- I swear to you. - You damn ...

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.832
Listen, that was not me. It was not me.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.999
Or were it might help you?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:54.781
- Have you been to Colonial Motel? - Already eternally no longer.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.876
Just so you know it, the Men in Black are back.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:08.836
Was?

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.776
Did you think they can not drive?

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.917
Thank you. Can you block my account,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.921
until I know where these charges come from?

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.591
I appreciate that. Thank you very much.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.595
Praise the Lord.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.026
CONTACT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CREDIT CARD DECLINED

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:29.256
System shuts down

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.023
Crap!

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.006
I said yes, she will have an accident. Hey!

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.370
- Hey! - Look look!

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.874
System shuts down

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.475
The men in black are ...

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.874
PROCESSOR DAMAGED

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.044
The men in black are back.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.550
The men in black are back.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.620
- I have to go.
 - Are you okay?

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.915
Everything OK?

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.018
You would die for me?

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.702
Thankfully you nothing happened in the accident.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:06.634
Would one of you please tell me now, the debit worth $ 76,000

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.785
by Hot Bot Incorporated and declare a $ 1,000 hotel bill?

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.563
- No. - I ...

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.747
Obviously, the guys are in love.

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:20.448
As you lie really completely wrong, Mom. In fact, you're an idiot.

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.397
I'll miss a equal fisting,

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.387
if you do not prove more respect your fucking mother.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.613
- You are angry. - Slow down.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.520
Find not that a bit brutal?

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.539
Now, if the stock of your son in the mud from my stirs ...

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.765
- I find a fist not so bad. - I have to agree with you.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.496
- What? - I think we all should

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.365
looking forward to the love of our children fit.

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:41.627
- Jeez! - Such expressions

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.572
- I will not tolerate. - Yes I agree with you.

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.675
I mean, if you want to keep both hands, that's ok.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.747
Mom, I do not love Nard in this way.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.914
Are you saying that it's all about sex?

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.712
And I understand perfectly.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:55.806
- I understand that. - Completely.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.520
In the camp there were not many girls.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.626
On the walks we often monitored head to head.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.751
- Head to head. - Head to head.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.133
- What? - Red head. Sometimes.

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.024
We want you but only support ok?

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.065
I do not even care Limus that you were in my closet

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.459
have taken and clothes.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.370
Probably you are wearing it and verkleidest you as a woman.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:16.639
No, it is not.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.040
Oh son, you play about the woman?

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.940
No, I ... Oh, my God.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:24.780
Dad stop, please googling on and think you knew everything.

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:27.480
Mom, I know your support estimate,

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.382
but you really lie so what from wrong.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.954
You there, you are our stupid parents!

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.651
And this head-to-head thing

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.492
when you were a boy is damn strange, ok?

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.627
We're just best friends, who want to depend,

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.594
and a couple of assholes want us to the leather.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.870
So spared us with this shit!

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.804
I would note that I see it that way.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.774
- That was fucked up. - That was brutal.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.136
Really cool!

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.045
Say goodbye to one another.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.915
You will not see for a while.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.049
How bad is it with you?

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.751
Let's say so, dude.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.826
I have an asshole that my dad could tear me so,

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.557
it hurts like hell.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.531
But because it is a totally terrible man really,

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:16.924
he will make a new me.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.162
Then I shit of two holes.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.655
Hey, man, the whole thing I'm really sorry.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.974
So then.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.469
I'll just drop by and ... We hear from each determined.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.003
- Crap. - Let's talk tomorrow?

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:47.508
- I ... I'll send you a text message. - Yes.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.090
Small software damage and a few cosmetic repairs.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.608
Suffers they?

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.882
I do not suffer.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:17.784

Plan? Why should I actually always have a plan?

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.739
Do you still want a plan.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.243
I can not bear. It's repulsive. And you do not like your mom.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.059
- And I do not even. - I had not had sex forever. OK.

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:10.649
- It's about female empowerment. - OK.

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.105
Women do not need self-empowerment. Stop it.

01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.833
No...

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:29.243
- Oh my God! - I am going to vomit!

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.749

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.589
- No.
 - Donald that keep under wraps.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.225
What's wrong with you bastards?

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.740
Comedies are more difficult than dramas.
