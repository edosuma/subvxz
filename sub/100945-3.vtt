WEBVTT

00:19.561 --> 00:20.520
Do you see it?

00:20.603 --> 00:21.438
No.

00:21.521 --> 00:24.774
No mention of rats, mice, rodents,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.943
rodent blood pressure tests?

00:27.027 --> 00:27.944
None.

00:28.903 --> 00:29.863
Wait.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.948
Oh, that says "House appropriations."

00:32.032 --> 00:33.992
So close to "mouse appropriations."

00:34.075 --> 00:36.119
This is an affront.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.428
Is he in?

00:53.511 --> 00:54.596
Yes. Yes, he is.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.808
What is this regarding?

00:58.892 --> 01:02.729
I am testifying with General Naird today

01:02.812 --> 01:04.898
at the budget hearing in Washington,

01:04.981 --> 01:08.777
and I would like to know
why my science budget

01:08.860 --> 01:11.112
pales in comparison

01:11.196 --> 01:16.701
to the riches devoted
to turning space into an orgy of death.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.080
ID?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
I left my ID at the lab.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.086
No one gets in without ID.

01:26.169 --> 01:31.549
Brad, will you tell this
prepubescent killing machine who I am?

01:31.883 --> 01:34.260
Uh, Duncan, this is Dr. Adrian Mallory.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.931
Well, I could confirm that
if he presented some ID.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.434
I entered the building without ID.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.145
Oh, wow.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.980
They should not have allowed that.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.412
The village idiot
is hiding in Naird's office!

02:04.999 --> 02:05.917
Anything?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.586
The project whereÂ I grow fur on plants
is gone.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.839
Well, that one was weird.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.925
You're weird.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.821
Thank you. Doctor... Mallory.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.573
You knew that.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.826
-Sorry, uh, he's in a meeting now.
-What meeting?

02:39.909 --> 02:41.786
Last-minute media prep with Fuck Tony.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.915
Fuck Tony says it's the most important
single hour of the general's life.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.958
Ugh.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.627
General Naird, you disgust me.
You're disgusting.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.670
Nobody's gonna say that.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.214
This is a congressional budget hearing,
not a roast.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.966
Yeah, well, as your head media consultant,

02:55.049 --> 02:57.552
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't prepare you for the worst.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.180
General Naird, you steaming pile of vomit!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.556
I hope you die!

03:01.639 --> 03:02.557
Okay, stop.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.060
Space Force is a bright, shiny new object

03:06.603 --> 03:08.188
that is asking for
the least amount of money

03:08.271 --> 03:09.314
of any of the armed forces.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.690
We haven't started any wars.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.525
We haven't had a My Lai yet.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.736
They're gonna embrace us with open arms.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.405
General Naird,
I did not say you could step down!

03:17.488 --> 03:21.242
Stop! I'll be back at 2100 hours.
Hold down the fort.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.995
Does all your authority on base
transfer to me while you're gone?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.914
All my responsibility. Half my authority.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.625
Oh. Is it okay if I still call you
in case anything...

03:28.708 --> 03:31.044
Brad, come on, dude. You're a general.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.545
-Come...
- Okay.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.589
See you on the flip, mustache.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.050
Hey, candies are for my visitors.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.384
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.929
Do you also own a van, you fucking creep?

03:41.846 --> 03:45.016
Yes, I do. And when my snoring
wakes my wife, I sleep in it.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.897
Where is my
rat blood pressure research funding?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.065
Do you hear yourself?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.609
And why are all my pages redacted?

03:54.692 --> 03:59.072
What, you don't think I could have
any valid thoughts about expenditures?

03:59.155 --> 04:01.741
Perhaps, but as a scientist,
you have a loyalty to reason.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.117
Makes you a little untrustworthy.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.327
Scientists are weird.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.412
It's why you're the only Muppet
that speaks nonsense.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.789
Even Animal uses words.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.915
Adrian, here's the deal.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.501
We are testifying
for the House Armed Services Committee.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.670
They are not going to give us
a billion dollars

04:13.753 --> 04:17.423
if we tell them we're going to use it
to give rats stomachaches.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.223
Sir, ready to go to the tarmac?

04:25.723 --> 04:26.933
Oh, good, you didn't leave yet.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.018
Hey, bug! What are you doing?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.104
Ditching first period just to see me off?

04:31.187 --> 04:33.481
No. Got suspended.
Gave a teacher the finger.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.524
Nice!

04:34.607 --> 04:36.734
You know, one time,
my history teacher gave me a "C,"

04:36.818 --> 04:38.611
so I planted drugs in his desk.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.489
And now,
he lives under a bridge like a troll.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.241
What do you mean, you got suspended?

04:43.324 --> 04:46.035
Yeah. My day's wide open,
so I can go to DC with you.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.705
You know, since you're responsible
for moving us to this hellhole

04:48.788 --> 04:49.622
and ruining my life.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.208
I mean, the least you could do
is let me see my old friends

04:52.292 --> 04:55.420
and shop at stores that don't, like,
exclusively sell Wrangler jeans.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.338
-Captain Ali?
-Yes, sir?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.675
Change of plans. I would like you
to keep an eye on my daughter today.

05:00.758 --> 05:03.803
Yes, sir. That is something
I'm capable of doing, sir,

05:03.886 --> 05:08.057
in addition to flying helicopters
in war zones, which is my job.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.770
Rat hemoglobins are substantially--

05:12.854 --> 05:14.981
Jesus, just let him fly the fucking thing!

05:16.733 --> 05:18.484
You're talking! He's gotta fly!

05:21.612 --> 05:23.781
-Whoops.
-What do you mean, "whoops"?

05:25.616 --> 05:28.077
-So, what are we gonna do?
-I don't know, same thing I always do.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.955
Go to the gym, walk the base a little,
maybe get some soft serve.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.290
Probably hit the gym again.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.918
Oh, I'm sorry. I bet you wish
you didn't flip off your teacher now, huh?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.671
Oh, and I bet you wish you didn't either.
Or worked a little harder in high school.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.922
Bitch, I got straight A's

05:40.006 --> 05:42.800
and a math degree
from the University of Hawaii, so back up.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.891
How big is this stupid base?

05:50.433 --> 05:51.559
Government waste.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.604
No wonder my high school
is just a row of portables by the highway.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.439
What are you talking about?
The gym is right up there.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.648
Or don't you live here?

05:57.732 --> 05:58.775
No, I live in DC.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.028
Ah, that's right, yes.
All right, that's the Pickering Building.

06:02.111 --> 06:05.323
Sometimes I take my lunch over there
and watch them build rocket engines.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.243
And that is where Dr. Banner works
with the gamma rays.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.914
Oh, and that's where we store
the vibranium that we stole from Wakanda.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.749
-Cool.
-Hey, what's up, Scraps?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.377
You know those clowns?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.253
And what's "Scraps"?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.964
Uh, yeah, I go to school with them.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.510
'Kay.

06:26.677 --> 06:30.139
Is it ironic we're taking
an empty C-130

06:30.223 --> 06:32.475
to a hearing on military waste?

06:32.558 --> 06:33.893
Adrian, stop spitting.

06:40.983 --> 06:41.943
What?

06:42.026 --> 06:44.404
I feel you overthinking this hearing.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.949
Isn't any thinking to you "overthinking"?

06:48.032 --> 06:52.995
"A good plan, violently executed now,
is better than a perfect plan next week."

06:53.079 --> 06:54.163
General Patton.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.208
"A pint of sweat
will save a gallon of blood."

06:57.291 --> 06:58.251
General Patton.

06:58.334 --> 07:01.587
"Someone needs to lead,
and someone needs to follow,

07:02.046 --> 07:04.590
but they are both equally
on the same team."

07:04.674 --> 07:05.508
General Naird.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.387
No, no, no! Not you. Joint Chiefs only.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.186
Ah, these hearings are bullcrap.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.856
We don't come clean about half our
defense spend, so what's the point?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.150
Well, it's not bullcrap for Space Force.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.152
First time
with your keister in the hot seat.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.194
Might be your last.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.574
Hey, guys!

07:29.657 --> 07:30.992
-What are you doing?
-Get out!

07:31.075 --> 07:32.577
- Out!
-No Coast Guard!

07:32.660 --> 07:34.662
Oh, come on, man.

07:35.079 --> 07:36.706
- Hey, Naird?
-Hmm?

07:36.789 --> 07:38.749
If you need any help
getting back at the Chinese

07:38.833 --> 07:42.086
for what they did to your satellite,
a little ground-and-pound...

07:43.421 --> 07:45.965
Whatever, I don't know. Let me know.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.800
Marines at your disposal.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.927
I appreciate the offer, but we're good.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.764
In fact, this little dust-up
with the Chinese made us even stronger.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.057
I'm kinda glad it happened.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.604
I just hope that our monkey
doesn't crack under Chinese interrogation.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.855
What?

08:01.772 --> 08:04.609
Never mind.
My main concern is our head scientist.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.861
He is just a pain in the ass.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.404
Yeah, I don't know how you do it.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.073
Imagine lab coats
telling us how to invade Iraq.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.452
"Oh, you can't bomb there,
that's an endangered yak."

08:15.703 --> 08:17.788
You seem pretty calm, Naird.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.831
Why wouldn't I be?

08:19.373 --> 08:22.210
Pentagon's got
a record-high budget request.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.711
And all because of you.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.757
A new branch that's done nothing
but blow up on launchpads

08:27.840 --> 08:30.968
and let the Chinese
slide their chopsticks up our buttholes.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.303
That's disgusting.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.013
Oh, it's disgusting, all right.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.518
Disgusting that Space Force
was taken from me

08:38.893 --> 08:41.395
and handed to a New Jersey nincompoop.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.564
But I'm sure the committee
will come to that conclusion

08:43.648 --> 08:44.941
after we testify.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.901
Get your junk out of my face, please.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.654
-Kneel.
-What?

08:49.737 --> 08:54.659
Kneel before me and pledge loyalty
to the great General Kick Grabaston,

08:54.742 --> 08:56.953
and I'll show mercy to you at the hearing.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.997
Space Force isn't going anywhere.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.208
And neither am I.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.710
Oh, you're going somewhere, Naird.
By the end of this hearing,

09:04.794 --> 09:07.630
I'm going to reabsorb Space Force
and its budget,

09:07.713 --> 09:10.007
like the world's most powerful tampon.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.470
I always thought that you were a tampon.

09:15.471 --> 09:19.475
Tampons spend all day in vaginas.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.562
Nothing manlier, if you ask me.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.565
All day? Five hours, tops.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.610
Three if you have uterine fibroids.
She knows what I'm talking about.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.614
Acknowledge my gender again,
and I will fuck you in the ass.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.825
Duly noted.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.121
Duly noted.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.380
I can't believe
this is how you spend your free time.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.090
You know,
you don't have to just sit there.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.968
You could maybe work out, or anything.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.220
No, I'm very aware of my options.
Thank you.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.141
Hey, Scraps. See any joints laying around
that we could smoke?

10:00.224 --> 10:01.475
That was a great one, Julio.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.227
I fucking nailed it!

10:04.020 --> 10:06.105
Hey. You two. Get back here.

10:07.481 --> 10:08.316
Now.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.361
Yeah, you, uh--Â  you said
something disrespectful to my guest,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.822
so you're gonna take a little run.
East launchpad.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.199
-That's very far, ma'am.
-And back.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.953
-That's almost twice as far, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am, right away. Running now.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.127
So, the story behind "Scraps" is--

10:28.210 --> 10:30.129
Oh, hey, I don't need to know.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.225
So, I thought you'd be
Miss Popular in school.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.146
Well, uh, "DC popular" is very different

10:47.229 --> 10:48.981
-from "Wild Horse popular."
-Ah.

10:49.065 --> 10:53.444
In Wild Horse, what matters
mostly relates to, uh, dirt bikes.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.197
-Yeah. Ability to chug Mountain Dew.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.783
Okay, but did you even give anyone
at school a chance,

10:58.866 --> 11:01.577
or did you just stroll in there
like a white Malia Obama?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.746
They didn't give me a chance.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790
Okay? I even pretended to like hunting.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.541
But they asked, "Hunting what?"

11:07.625 --> 11:09.877
-And then I panicked and said "whales."
-You did not.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.088
-Yeah.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.428
Dr. Mallory, is it?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.015
General Grabaston. Hi.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.892
Big fan.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.769
-Thank you.
-Big fan.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.980
So, how's it going at Space Force?

11:30.564 --> 11:31.774
Could be better.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.150
I bet.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.694
Naird is a brute.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.070
Mm.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.659
Damn shame about the ice.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.537
What ice?

11:45.162 --> 11:47.456
The ice that's melting
everywhere on Earth.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.126
Uh... yes.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.629
Yeah, I... I care about the ice...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.883
and the animals
that depend on that ice to live.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.510
Ice birds.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.178
Ice bears.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.014
Hmm.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.391
You know...

12:06.851 --> 12:09.687
if the committee loses faith
in Naird today,

12:10.146 --> 12:11.814
I would run Space Force.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.943
And I would have you operating
with twice the funding

12:16.026 --> 12:17.486
and none of the oversight.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.949
I'm not sure
we should be having this conversation.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.744
Oh, we're not having this conversation.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.371
I'll see you at the hearing.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.213
Prepare to have your mind blown.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.257
Please be aliens.Â Please be aliens.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.468
Okay, well, not quite.
But like our aliens,

12:40.551 --> 12:43.012
we do keep it frozen
and in locked containers.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.930
Meal Armstrong's?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.934
"One small snack for a man,
one large soda for mankind."

12:49.018 --> 12:49.852
-Wow.
-Yes!

12:49.935 --> 12:51.937
It is the best acai in Wild Horse.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.939
Well, I mean,
it's the only acai in Wild Horse.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.483
But it is so, so good.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.152
Hey. I know you.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.737
I've seen you taking a bath.

13:00.154 --> 13:00.988
-Mm--
-What?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.866
Your dad has photos of you on his desk.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.993
One when you're little and in the tub.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.912
You're General Naird's daughter, right?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.748
Although you look, um,
different in person.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.541
Less happy?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.668
No, I think you changed your hair.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.337
Duncan Tabner.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.505
Sweetwater, Alabama.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.507
Erin Naird.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.674
Abortionville, Blue State.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.967
Whoo! There she goes.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.844
That was a joke. She's joking, of course.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.970
And I got it.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.599
Uh, well, ladies.

13:28.682 --> 13:29.975
Enjoy your "ack-eye."

13:30.351 --> 13:33.145
It'll put that two-year-old's grin
right back on your puss.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.188
My puss?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.106
Southern for "face."

13:36.190 --> 13:38.108
Well, it's Northern for "pussy."

13:38.776 --> 13:40.736
So I wouldn't go around
saying that to people.

13:42.071 --> 13:42.988
Erin Naird.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.281
Ma'am.

13:46.992 --> 13:47.910
Okay.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.246
No. Okay, I'm not mad at that.
No, he's cute, right?

13:50.329 --> 13:51.872
And he's about your age, so...

13:52.957 --> 13:56.043
I'm seeing someone.
And, uh, "my age," too young for me.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.844
Congressman Schugler.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.303
What, no hug?

14:12.476 --> 14:15.187
Well, that was awkward and horrible.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.649
The man is about to grill you.
Let him bring it in for the real thing.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.986
Remember, you gotta embrace
to get those dollars for space.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.530
Representative Pitosi.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.074
What are you doing?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.202
I was just greeting you.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.288
We don't have that kind of relationship,
General.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.455
Yes, understood.

14:34.915 --> 14:35.916
Well done.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.334
Earning your pay.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.753
Maybe just play on your phone
for the rest of the day.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.756
He doesn't know how to hug.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.467
Why am I in trouble
because boomers are weird around women?

14:47.011 --> 14:47.928
Okay.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.179
You were right.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.057
-This acai is crazy good. Mm-hmm.
-Right?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.184
About as healthy
as a bowl of grape ice cream, too.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.895
Hey, baby!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.230
You came to see Daddy at work?

14:59.148 --> 15:00.107
And also, your father?

15:00.858 --> 15:01.692
Hey.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.776
-Hi.
-Give me a hug.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.111
-Okay.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.031
-Eh...
-Oh, uh, this is... this is Angela.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.909
Oh, are, um-- are you guys doing this?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.286
- Exactly, uh, right.
-Okay.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.496
We have much cultural exchange.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.664
-Yeah.
- Okay.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.584
Yeah, sure. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call you later.

15:19.043 --> 15:19.877
Okay.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.878
Okay. Bye.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.129
Yeah. Bye.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.466
Bye.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.683
-Nice guy.
-Don't.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.937
-Yeah, no, feels like a good match.
-Shut up.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.606
I mean, he's gotta be the nicest
of all the creepy older Russian dudes

15:40.689 --> 15:42.816
that you could be ruining your life with,
right?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.319
And, uh, who are you dating?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.404
The clutch on your helicopter?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.406
What? No, girl, I'm just jealous, okay?

15:49.490 --> 15:53.410
Look, if I could get some super
snappy-dressing foreign guy to like me

15:53.494 --> 15:55.412
because of my proximity
to classified information,

15:55.496 --> 15:57.331
I would totally jump at it.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.926
Hmm. No panty lines
on the angry young congresswoman.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.011
You know what that means.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.554
No panties.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.849
They actually make panties
that don't show panty lines.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.478
Oh, you think
she's wearing those types of panties?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.606
I believe
there's a higher degree of probability

16:22.690 --> 16:25.818
she's wearing those type of panties
than no panties at all.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.070
Would you two stop saying "panties"?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.114
You can't give me an order, Naird.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.115
Gentlemen...

16:32.408 --> 16:33.367
they're ready for you.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.744
Panties.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.332
Since when did you and Kick Grabaston
start hanging out

16:40.416 --> 16:42.584
and talking about women's underwear?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.920
He wanted my input. I gave it to him.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.756
That reminds me. Keep quiet in there,
unless I give you a signal.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.010
Did we agree on a signal?
I don't think so.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.596
How about, "Dr. Mallory will now explain

16:54.680 --> 16:57.141
how man and his barbaric nature

16:57.224 --> 17:00.144
will destroy space, as he has the Earth."

17:00.853 --> 17:01.770
Too wordy.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.647
I'll just tap on the table twice
with a pencil.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.648
Mm.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.251
Uh...

17:24.543 --> 17:25.753
General Naird,

17:26.503 --> 17:30.632
you're asking for a 150% increase

17:30.716 --> 17:33.969
in the budget for Space Force?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.972
Uh, and that will be used...

17:38.307 --> 17:39.933
To defend America.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.103
Chairwoman,

17:44.271 --> 17:47.149
I, uh, yield the rest of my time.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.069
This, uh, budget looks A-OK to me!

17:50.652 --> 17:52.237
And, uh, General Naird,

17:52.780 --> 17:53.739
thank you.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.284
I feel safer
knowing that we have satellites

17:57.367 --> 17:58.535
that can rain

17:58.619 --> 18:03.332
God's holy hellfire upon our enemies

18:03.415 --> 18:08.128
on this majestic, flat Earth of ours.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.255
Yes, Congressman,

18:10.339 --> 18:12.674
this Earth is certainly majestic.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.468
And flat.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.262
Well, jury's still out on that one.

18:18.305 --> 18:22.559
General Naird, I'll take some of
the gentlemen from Oklahoma's time

18:22.643 --> 18:25.896
that he yielded
to ask you one brief question.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.524
Why do you exist?

18:29.441 --> 18:32.611
The Yankees won the 1961 World Series

18:32.694 --> 18:35.614
and my parents got a little carried away
with their celebration.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.700
Okay!

18:39.076 --> 18:41.328
Charming, but no.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.580
I mean Space Force.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.417
It was much cheaper
under General Grabaston and the Air Force.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.045
Cheap generals are like cheap enchiladas.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.797
You end up paying for it on the back end.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.134
All due respect,
but under General Grabaston,

18:55.217 --> 18:59.304
our supremacy in space was eclipsed
by the Russians and the Chinese.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.431
It is my job

19:01.932 --> 19:04.268
to keep space safe for American interests.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.562
In order to do that, I need money.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.106
How exactly have you been making it safe?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.775
-That is top secret.
-Yes, I can see that.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.529
Or should I say... I can't see that.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.574
Well, we are making

19:19.158 --> 19:22.369
scientific leaps that are not top secret.

19:22.786 --> 19:27.833
Making the world
a better and cleaner place.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.043
Great.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.045
Tell us about that.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.551
Mm. Mm-hmm.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.978
- I'm all ears.
-Yeah.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.981
Yeah.
Well, if you're at a loss for words,

19:51.064 --> 19:54.026
I can yield to our youngest member,

19:54.109 --> 19:55.319
who rarely is.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.531
The committee recognizes
the congresswoman from New York,

20:00.073 --> 20:01.950
Anabela Ysidro-Campos.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.494
Yes.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.246
-General Naird.
-Hello.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.874
Your entire attitude seems to be,

20:08.957 --> 20:12.377
"Give us money
and don't look while we militarize space."

20:13.212 --> 20:15.923
Your head scientist is nodding.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.925
It is a condition.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.885
Drinking Bird Syndrome.

20:20.510 --> 20:21.887
Look, space...

20:23.555 --> 20:24.973
is hard.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.894
"Space is hard."

20:30.854 --> 20:32.773
If you haven't settled on a motto yet,

20:32.856 --> 20:35.359
may I suggest that
that become the new Space Force motto.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.278
Well... exactly.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.571
Tap-tap.

20:39.821 --> 20:40.989
Tap-tap.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.367
Tap!

20:44.159 --> 20:45.077
Tap-tap!

20:46.620 --> 20:49.831
Mmm. Tap-tap. Tap-tap.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.125
Tap-tap.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.132
Are you okay?

20:59.466 --> 21:00.300
Tap-tap.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.302
Just gentle. Gentle.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.098
Look... Just gentle!

21:06.181 --> 21:07.724
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.935
-Uh...
-No, seriously.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.520
What am I supposed to do here?

21:12.312 --> 21:14.564
Do you know what it's like
to have no one to talk to?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.986
I mean, if you don't have a dirt bike here
or you're not sniffing glue...

21:20.821 --> 21:21.738
Forget it.

21:25.826 --> 21:26.910
Get a job.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.788
Like where?

21:31.081 --> 21:33.083
I'm a high school junior with no skills.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.168
Well, okay, off base,

21:35.252 --> 21:37.629
we've got the cowboy boot store
down by the highway.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.381
Uh, the best restaurant in town,

21:39.464 --> 21:40.924
also known as the strip club.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.469
Actually, I know a place
that is closer to your house

21:44.553 --> 21:46.930
that needs
a sustenance procurement coordinator.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.473
What?

21:48.557 --> 21:51.476
It's just military
for "soft serve slinger."

21:51.893 --> 21:53.979
Yeah, I mean,
it's either that or the strip club.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.565
With your skinny butt, you're probably
gonna make more selling soft serve.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.650
Oh, that is until you
eat enough soft serve

21:58.734 --> 22:00.235
to make more at the strip club.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.488
It's kind of a
"eat for the job you want" kind of vibe.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.531
Mmm.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.158
General Naird,

22:06.992 --> 22:07.993
what is this?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.454
An orange?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.080
How much do you think it costs?

22:12.622 --> 22:13.457
A dollar?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.459
How much do you think it costs
Space Force?

22:15.542 --> 22:18.837
-Dollar-fifty?
-It costs $10,000.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.005
-Oh, shit.

22:20.088 --> 22:23.633
As part of your resupply launch
to the ISS last month,

22:23.717 --> 22:26.928
you sent up a variety of fresh,
non-dehydrated foods,

22:27.012 --> 22:31.725
including one orange,
at the transport cost of $10,000.

22:31.808 --> 22:36.104
Yeah, yes. It's been our policy since NASA
to allow astronauts one pound

22:36.188 --> 22:38.148
of the food of their choice
at each resupply.

22:38.231 --> 22:39.941
Even if it's a $10,000 orange?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.527
Well, sometimes
it's just not about saving money.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.822
Sometimes it is,
when it's a budget hearing.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.449
But, please, defend it.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.869
I wanna be able
to tell my constituents on food stamps

22:51.286 --> 22:54.748
why your agency needs a $10,000 orange.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.878
All right, I'll try.

23:03.131 --> 23:06.385
One thing you learn in the military
is that money doesn't matter.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.470
People matter.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.725
Thousands of people working tirelessly,
day and night.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.353
And we may have spent a billion dollars

23:16.436 --> 23:18.313
to put one astronaut in a position

23:18.397 --> 23:20.816
where they can do something
that'll benefit everybody.

23:21.566 --> 23:25.362
And that one astronaut
may be a human being

23:25.821 --> 23:28.949
who is risking her life
in a very dangerous pursuit.

23:29.491 --> 23:33.245
A human being who is not doing it
for the money, by the way.

23:34.079 --> 23:38.250
A human being who is battling fear

23:38.834 --> 23:42.087
and exhaustion and uncertainty.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.299
And who has been eating
dehydrated mac and cheese,

23:46.716 --> 23:49.719
mixed with her own filtered urine,
for the last month.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.558
I want her to have a taste of the Earth.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.394
And remember what she's fighting for.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.776
I see billionaires in the news

24:04.860 --> 24:09.156
who look at space
like it's where we're all going to go

24:09.239 --> 24:10.574
when we trash this planet.

24:10.657 --> 24:15.120
Well, there is no substitute in space
for this planet.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.332
You cannot make an orange
out of powder and urine,

24:19.416 --> 24:20.750
no matter how hard we try.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.669
Only God can make an orange.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.504
Well, whoever made it,

24:24.588 --> 24:27.007
we're the only place in the universe
you can get it.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.260
We better take care of this planet
and the people who live here.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.474
And what better reminder of the Earth
than an orange.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.727
Because an orange, like the Earth itself,

24:38.810 --> 24:41.271
is perfect and round.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.106
It's a flat rectangle!

24:43.190 --> 24:45.859
No, Bob, not really.

24:45.942 --> 24:49.696
Come on.
We are putting people's lives at risk

24:49.779 --> 24:53.200
in the pursuit of science
to solve our many problems.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.243
You don't get to drive my vulva!

24:55.327 --> 24:57.662
You don't get to drive my vulva!

24:57.746 --> 25:01.541
You don't get to drive my vulva!
You don't get to drive my vulva!

25:01.625 --> 25:04.794
No, no! This is Space Force!

25:05.462 --> 25:09.799
The Supreme Court nomination hearing
is Wednesday.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.677
What the fuck was that?

25:13.553 --> 25:15.138
All right, sorry. Sorry.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.724
-Got it.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.017
To sum up,

25:21.645 --> 25:23.104
this country has enough wealth

25:23.772 --> 25:27.943
that we can give an astronaut
who is risking her life for all of us

25:28.193 --> 25:30.362
an orange every once in a while.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.697
Pretty words,

25:33.031 --> 25:37.285
but I'm still not hearing any specifics
about the science.

25:37.494 --> 25:41.122
How do you help
my constituents on food stamps?

25:41.206 --> 25:44.417
Maybe it would be cheaper to give
your constituents a nutritional paste,

25:44.501 --> 25:45.794
if all you care about is money.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.587
Would you like us to work on that?

25:48.004 --> 25:49.756
Dr. Adrian Mallory,

25:49.839 --> 25:51.841
Chief Scientist, Space Force.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.055
If you want specifics,
we are developing a new climate satellite

25:57.556 --> 26:00.850
that will provide such precise forecasts

26:00.934 --> 26:05.272
that the advance warning times
for tornadoes and hurricanes

26:05.355 --> 26:06.439
will be tripled,

26:06.523 --> 26:11.736
potentially saving tens of thousands
of American lives

26:11.820 --> 26:16.950
and hundreds of billions
of American dollars in disaster relief.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.660
Sounds wonderful.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.120
It is.

26:20.203 --> 26:24.791
But what if a foreign aggressor
shoots that satellite down?

26:25.750 --> 26:29.462
Not every country with a presence in space

26:29.546 --> 26:32.465
believes in "good for all."

26:35.135 --> 26:36.094
Tap-tap.

26:40.140 --> 26:44.227
Dr. Mallory came to me recently
with a project near and dear to his heart.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.564
Something that could benefit
all humankind.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.150
I believe it involved rat diarrhea.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.029
And I would like him to be able
to continue his experiments

26:54.112 --> 26:56.156
without fear of them being destroyed.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.324
Wouldn't you agree?

26:59.117 --> 27:02.912
General Naird, Dr. Mallory,
you may step down.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.876
Not you, General Grabaston.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.462
I have questions for you.

27:12.213 --> 27:16.968
Why did you spend eight million
to upgrade the F-22

27:17.052 --> 27:19.387
with ostrich leather seats?

27:22.557 --> 27:26.811
Because ostriches are... feathery,

27:27.145 --> 27:29.356
like the magical Earth.
