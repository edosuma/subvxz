They always seem to have that
sort of farty, little sound on TV shows.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.166
[Glyn] Well, don't forget,
you're hearing it on a TV speaker,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.458
which is a grotty speaker.

19:44.541 --> 19:48.125
But see, this place sounds terrible now.
It may just be great.

-We really got good separation.
-[Glyn] Yeah.

19:59.458 --> 20:03.000
The thing is,
that an open-air sound is fantastic.

20:03.083 --> 20:06.208
I've always wanted to do something
in the open air.

20:06.291 --> 20:09.708
It'd be nice to try and find some way
to do it out of doors.

20:09.791 --> 20:10.791
[Glyn] It's so bloody cold.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.625
[Michael] It's your English rain which is
worrying about outdoors in this country.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.041
-[Glyn] Yeah, right.
-Snow or rain will do me.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.291
You know, wind and anything.
Make all that…

20:18.375 --> 20:20.750

-[Glyn laughs] Yes, you could.

have a few deaths on the set

20:28.416 --> 20:29.666

20:30.666 --> 20:33.375
I was very taken by the place
Denis talked about.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.291
[Glyn] Yeah. That was…

20:35.375 --> 20:37.833
Because I could see it outside torch-lit.

we're not going abroad.

20:44.791 --> 20:45.791
[Michael] Hmm.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.625

he doesn't wanna go abroad.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.541
No, and he put his foot down.

20:52.541 --> 20:54.208
-So…
-Yeah?

20:58.333 --> 21:01.083

[Glyn] He won't give up.

21:09.625 --> 21:11.583

they do their overdubs

[Glyn] He worked for Pye Color Television…

46:04.125 --> 46:06.708
[George] No, he was in England
and John Dunbar asked him

46:06.791 --> 46:09.416

for The Stones' tour.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.500
[Michael] Yeah.

46:10.583 --> 46:12.083

46:12.166 --> 46:14.833
Then he met John, and then he met us.

46:14.916 --> 46:16.833
-[Michael] Hmm.
-And he's been there ever since.

46:16.916 --> 46:17.916
[Michael] Hmm. Hmm.

story about Alex and his foot pedal am I?

46:21.750 --> 46:23.000
[Glyn] Have you actually tried it out or--

46:23.083 --> 46:26.000
You see, the thing is
he just comes across things

46:26.083 --> 46:29.833
and then he says,
"Oh, yeah, I've done this."

46:29.916 --> 46:31.500
But he hasn't actually made it

46:31.583 --> 46:34.791
because he's busy building
recording studios.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.125
[George Martin] I don't think we should
have Alex build one

we've only got 12 more days,

58:40.666 --> 58:44.291

you know I'm not trying to get you.

59:07.041 --> 59:10.791

"Look lads, the band,

59:15.458 --> 59:18.083

Now, whatever it is that will please you,
I'll do it.

Now come on. Look--

59:46.666 --> 59:49.166
We've gotta do this.
We've really gotta sort out this,

59:49.250 --> 59:53.125
'cause we're rehearsing, and we're trying
to, like, get it together for the TV show.

59:53.208 --> 59:56.500
So we really-- Like you said,
we've only been through four numbers.

59:57.708 --> 1:00:01.416
So we probably gotta get some system
to get through, like, 20 or 30,

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.166
and know them all and have learnt them.

1:00:03.250 --> 1:00:05.125
So that we get all the chords.

1:00:05.208 --> 1:00:07.666
-So we can all vamp them all.
-Yeah.

1:00:07.750 --> 1:00:10.375
Then we can, like,
all play every solo we need.

1:00:10.458 --> 1:00:13.208
But, like,
it's gotta sound as though it's improving.

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:24.541
[Paul] Yeah, I know what you mean.

1:00:24.625 --> 1:00:28.375
It's just that that way of doing it
puts me off the way I'm trying to do it.

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000
[Paul] Yeah.

1:00:37.708 --> 1:00:39.083
Let's do another song.

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.583
This is why we take so long.

1:00:46.750 --> 1:00:50.458
I think we play it shitty ten times,
and so it's sort of in there.

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:53.125
And then I think we could come
and play it quite good then.

None of us has had the idea

1:06:57.791 --> 1:06:58.958
Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1:06:59.041 --> 1:07:01.375
[Michael] And that's why, uh…

1:07:02.375 --> 1:07:04.708
I think if you all have decided
to do a show,

1:07:04.791 --> 1:07:06.208
then it should be the best show.

1:07:09.750 --> 1:07:10.750
Know what I mean?

1:07:10.833 --> 1:07:13.458

about that though, is that, uh,

1:07:14.291 --> 1:07:15.416
we don't want to go away.

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:17.166

-I mean, visually, it is fantastic.
-[Paul] But we're not going away.

1:07:22.333 --> 1:07:24.166
[Michael] My trouble is…

1:07:31.666 --> 1:07:33.041
We could make it like requests.

1:07:33.125 --> 1:07:35.708
[Paul] We should do the show
in a place we're not allowed to do it.

1:07:35.791 --> 1:07:38.125
You know, like, we should trespass,
go in, set up,

1:07:38.208 --> 1:07:40.666
and then get moved,
and that should be the show.

1:07:40.750 --> 1:07:44.083
I mean, you know,
if you put us in the Houses of Parliament,

1:07:44.166 --> 1:07:46.625
playing in the main gallery
at the Houses of Parliament,

1:07:46.708 --> 1:07:48.375
and getting forcibly ejected,

1:07:48.458 --> 1:07:50.875
still trying to play numbers,
and the police lifting you…

1:07:50.958 --> 1:07:52.625

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:54.375

boots and truncheons and all that.

1:08:00.666 --> 1:08:02.583
You have to take a bit of violence.

1:08:02.666 --> 1:08:03.958
I think that's too dangerous.

1:08:12.833 --> 1:08:14.541
But I don't mean for really sick kids.

1:08:14.625 --> 1:08:16.708
I mean for kids with broken legs.

1:08:16.791 --> 1:08:20.458
I mean, really, kind of,
1944 Hollywood musical Bing Crosby kids.

1:08:20.541 --> 1:08:24.208
[Paul] Or in a hospital,
they can't all get up and walk. [laughs]

1:08:24.291 --> 1:08:26.166
Except for the finale.

1:08:26.250 --> 1:08:27.291
[Michael] Oh, yes!

1:08:27.375 --> 1:08:30.541
[Paul] When John walks up to
the little girl and says, "Come here."

1:08:30.625 --> 1:08:32.208
And she gets up and walks.

1:08:32.291 --> 1:08:34.875
[Michael] Or maybe an orphans' home?
An orphans' home.

1:08:34.958 --> 1:08:37.125
Children are the hope
of the future department.

1:08:37.791 --> 1:08:39.958
What about an orphanage?

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:41.416
How does that grab you guys?

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:44.750
It's like, "Going once, going twice,
going three times and that's it."

1:08:44.833 --> 1:08:45.833
[Paul] No.

1:08:47.041 --> 1:08:49.291
[Michael] Orphanage--
Orphanage going downhill.

1:08:54.375 --> 1:08:56.208
What's the biggest charity in the world?

1:08:56.291 --> 1:08:57.416
I don't mean in terms of polio,

1:08:57.500 --> 1:08:59.583
but what's the most charitable thing
anybody could do?

1:08:59.666 --> 1:09:00.666
[George] They say--

1:09:00.750 --> 1:09:04.000
Don't they say, "Charity begins at home"?

1:09:04.083 --> 1:09:06.083
-[all laugh]
-[Paul] We'll do it at George's house.

1:09:06.166 --> 1:09:08.208
[all laugh]

1:09:10.833 --> 1:09:14.875
[Paul] We gotta have some serious reason
for doing this or else we won't.

1:09:16.416 --> 1:09:17.583
What's it for?

1:09:17.666 --> 1:09:19.416
Can't be for the money.

1:09:19.500 --> 1:09:22.875
I've decided the whole point of it
is communication.

1:09:22.958 --> 1:09:25.333
And to be on TV is communication.

1:09:25.416 --> 1:09:28.958
We've got a chance to smile at people,
like "All You Need Is Love."

1:09:29.041 --> 1:09:31.958
But-- So that's me incentive for doing it.

1:09:39.375 --> 1:09:43.625
The worst that we have is
a documentary of us making an LP

1:09:43.708 --> 1:09:45.083
if we don't get into a show.

1:09:45.166 --> 1:09:46.833
But we haven't played together, you see.

1:09:46.916 --> 1:09:48.208
That's the fucking thing.

1:09:48.291 --> 1:09:50.125
But when we do come together to play,

1:09:50.208 --> 1:09:52.500
we all just sort of talk
about the fucking past!

1:09:52.583 --> 1:09:54.333
We're like old age pensioners.

1:09:54.416 --> 1:09:56.541
"Remember the days when we used to rock?"

1:09:56.625 --> 1:09:59.750
You know, but we're here now,
and we can do it, you know?

1:09:59.833 --> 1:10:02.958
But, I mean, all I want to see
is enthusiasm!

1:10:04.291 --> 1:10:08.541
See, the thing is also I get to a bit
where I just sort of push all my ideas.

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:13.541
You know, I mean, a lot will come out
of it if we could get the enthusiasm.

1:10:13.625 --> 1:10:17.916
I mean, why are you here?
I'm here 'cause I wanna do a show.

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000
But I really don't feel
an awful lot of support.

1:10:21.083 --> 1:10:24.500
We keep coming up against that one,
and I keep saying,

1:10:24.583 --> 1:10:26.625
"Yeah well,
I'd like to do this, this and that."

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:30.833
And we end up doing something again
that nobody really wants to do.

1:10:30.916 --> 1:10:32.833
If this one turns into that,

1:10:32.916 --> 1:10:35.083
it should definitely be
the last for all of us.

1:10:35.166 --> 1:10:36.750
Because there just isn't any point.

1:10:36.833 --> 1:10:39.458
[Michael] I think that'd be sad.
I mean, as an audience. That'd be sad.

1:10:39.541 --> 1:10:41.958
Course it is!
It's stupid. It is just stupid.

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:46.208
You see, the people who are being stupid
are the four of us.

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:52.083
…which it always is.

1:10:52.166 --> 1:10:57.166
The Beatles have been in doldrums
for at least a year.

1:10:58.041 --> 1:11:02.125
Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away,
it's never been the same.

1:11:02.208 --> 1:11:04.875
I mean, we've been very negative
since Mr. Epstein passed away.

1:11:04.958 --> 1:11:08.958
And that's why all of us, in turn,
have been sick of the group.

1:11:09.041 --> 1:11:10.666
It's discipline we lack.

1:11:10.750 --> 1:11:11.791
We've never had discipline.

1:11:11.875 --> 1:11:14.625
We had a sort of slight,
symbolic discipline.

1:11:14.708 --> 1:11:16.166
Like Mr. Epstein.

1:11:16.250 --> 1:11:19.416
You know, and he sort of said,
"Get suits on," and we did.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:22.916
You know, and so we were always fighting
that discipline a bit.

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.041
[all chuckle]

1:11:24.125 --> 1:11:28.250
There really is no one there now
to say, "Do it."

1:11:28.333 --> 1:11:29.958
Whereas there always used to be.

1:11:30.041 --> 1:11:34.708
Daddy's gone away now,
and we're on our own at the holiday camp.

1:11:34.791 --> 1:11:38.958
I think we either go home or we do it.

1:11:43.875 --> 1:11:46.416
I think we've got a bit shy, you know?

1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:50.791
I think I've got a bit shy
of certain things, you know?

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:53.541
'Cause you know how often, like, on albums
we sometimes blow one of your songs,

1:11:53.625 --> 1:11:55.333
'cause we come in in the wrong mood.

1:11:55.416 --> 1:11:58.250
And you say,
"This is how it goes. I'll be back."

1:11:58.333 --> 1:12:01.291
And we're all just,
"Oh, well you…" [scats]

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:04.333
[Michael] That's why we're wrong
to throw away the show.

1:12:04.416 --> 1:12:05.958
Because there's no desire.

1:12:06.666 --> 1:12:09.250
[Paul] So it's like,
if we're doing the show,

1:12:09.333 --> 1:12:11.000
we're gonna have to work hard.

1:12:11.791 --> 1:12:14.458
And that means
by the time a week from now comes

1:12:14.541 --> 1:12:17.541
all these songs we've got,
we've gotta know perfectly.

1:12:20.541 --> 1:12:21.958
Because they just turn out shitty--

1:12:22.041 --> 1:12:25.416
No, but this-- Thinking it's not gonna
come out great won't help.

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:29.125
If we cancel the show now,
we'll be throwing it away.

1:12:29.208 --> 1:12:31.166
[Michael] But equally,
at the moment we haven't got a show

1:12:31.250 --> 1:12:32.791
and so none of us really want to do it.

1:12:32.875 --> 1:12:33.875
[Paul] I'll do it.

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:38.166
I'm not interested, you know, to spend
my fucking days farting around here,

1:12:38.250 --> 1:12:41.541
while everyone makes up their minds
whether they want to do it or not.

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:44.541
It's like Mal said last night,
"If you're gonna do the show here,

1:12:44.625 --> 1:12:47.041
you've gotta decide today."

1:12:47.125 --> 1:12:49.125
And as far as I can see,
there's only two ways.

1:12:49.208 --> 1:12:51.125
We're gonna do it,
or we're not gonna do it.

1:12:51.208 --> 1:12:53.500
And I want a decision!

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:55.166
[George] Maybe we should have a divorce.

1:12:55.250 --> 1:12:57.375
[Paul]
Well, I said that at the last meeting.

1:12:58.833 --> 1:13:00.458
But it's getting nearer, you know?

1:13:01.916 --> 1:13:03.375
[John] Who'd have the children?

1:13:04.541 --> 1:13:05.583
[Paul] Dick James.

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:06.750
[John] Oh, yeah.

1:13:08.458 --> 1:13:09.958
We all need you.

1:13:10.541 --> 1:13:13.333
And, you know,
if you all can't get it together,

1:13:13.416 --> 1:13:15.458
that's really very sad.

1:13:15.541 --> 1:13:18.958
So, I think what we should do now
is let you play a little

1:13:19.041 --> 1:13:21.291
and then you all have lunch together.

1:13:22.166 --> 1:13:25.375

They had a fellow on a trolley,

And you then being presented onstage,

1:26:18.541 --> 1:26:20.708
you should be sitting there
when they are coming in.

1:26:20.791 --> 1:26:24.041
[Paul] And then you open the doors
and we're in the middle of a number.

Or you're just sitting, waiting, and then
when everybody's there, then you start.

As opposed to you coming on
as The Beatles, it's much more intimate.

[chuckling] Yeah.

1:26:49.791 --> 1:26:52.583

are we going to do it here?

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:54.041
'Cause they've got to build
a control room.

1:26:54.125 --> 1:26:56.791

1:27:01.333 --> 1:27:02.500
No, I don't know anywhere.

1:27:02.583 --> 1:27:03.833

Where do you think?

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:06.875
[George Martin] I think you might as well
do it right here.

1:27:06.958 --> 1:27:09.458
[Paul] But, acoustically,
it's not very good here, is it?

1:27:09.541 --> 1:27:12.083
[George Martin] It's not as good
as it could be elsewhere, you know?

1:27:12.166 --> 1:27:13.666
[Paul] Now what would make it?

1:27:13.750 --> 1:27:15.916

And you'll see the sea
and you'll be in a theater.

1:33:11.375 --> 1:33:12.958
I mean, there's not a duff album.

1:33:13.041 --> 1:33:15.916
But see,
it is kind of like four years ago.

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:17.541
And there's nothing wrong
with four years ago,

1:33:17.625 --> 1:33:19.208
except we're all 28 now as opposed--

1:33:19.291 --> 1:33:22.583
-I don't mean that…
-We're all… Yes, we are.

1:33:22.666 --> 1:33:27.000
We're all 28, or whatever we are
in the group. Baby George there.

1:33:27.708 --> 1:33:30.958
I mean, it's not only you as the band
and it's not only them as songwriters.

1:33:31.041 --> 1:33:32.250
It is the four of you.

1:33:32.333 --> 1:33:35.208
[John] If you got a lot of blocks made,
you could build any formation you want.

1:33:35.291 --> 1:33:38.166
-[Denis] Fit in like a Meccano.
-If you've got box-shaped plastic,

1:33:38.250 --> 1:33:41.291
you can build it that long if you want,
or just have it that short.

1:33:41.375 --> 1:33:42.958
[Denis] Like Kubrick would do.

1:33:43.041 --> 1:33:45.041
And it's got to be the best.

1:33:45.125 --> 1:33:46.250
Because…

1:33:47.166 --> 1:33:49.625
I mean, the hearts of millions
are with you, you know what I mean?

1:33:49.708 --> 1:33:51.166
It's got to be the best. It can't--

1:33:53.541 --> 1:33:56.041
I'm not saying you owe it to the world
or anything like that.

1:33:56.125 --> 1:33:58.250
But if it is going to be
your last TV show--

1:34:05.458 --> 1:34:07.791
But I don't want you
to be unhappy 'cause, like…

1:34:07.875 --> 1:34:09.916
I love you
like I love your three colleagues.

1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.833
[Denis] You see, then it's nice to have
the levels where they can dance

1:34:12.916 --> 1:34:14.958
and, you know,
whatever they wanna do, you see?

1:34:15.041 --> 1:34:17.333
[John] Look, you could have
our thing plastic too.

1:34:17.416 --> 1:34:19.375
[Denis]
Yeah, that would be knockout to do that.

1:34:19.458 --> 1:34:23.125
And then we could do what we like
with the backing, have it go black or…

1:34:23.208 --> 1:34:24.208
-[John] Yeah, yeah.
-[Denis] Black.

1:34:24.291 --> 1:34:25.916
Or stark or something, you know?

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.750
See, I'd watch an hour of him
just playing the piano.

1:34:28.833 --> 1:34:30.208
Me too. Uh…

1:34:30.291 --> 1:34:31.541
'Cause he's so great.

1:34:32.250 --> 1:34:33.333
But, like, I think--

1:34:33.416 --> 1:34:36.708
See, I think we gotta find a place
which would complement it.

1:34:36.791 --> 1:34:40.583
And I don't see it being here on a stage
with tubular scaffolding around it.

1:34:40.666 --> 1:34:43.500
Then we can control all our lights
from a panel.

1:34:43.583 --> 1:34:45.250
And we can have what colors you like.

1:34:45.333 --> 1:34:47.750
[John] Yes. You'll always be able
to see us through everything.

1:34:47.833 --> 1:34:48.833
[Denis] That's right.

1:34:48.916 --> 1:34:51.208
[John] I'll have the plastic
when you're finished with it.

1:34:51.291 --> 1:34:54.416
Well, can we all talk about it?

1:34:54.500 --> 1:34:57.125
If-- You will take the veto off

1:34:57.208 --> 1:35:02.291
if you can be convinced
that we can get an audience out there.

1:35:03.916 --> 1:35:06.208
Okay, I love you. That's fine.

1:35:09.958 --> 1:35:10.791
Okay, thanks.

1:35:10.875 --> 1:35:14.333
I just do think,
like, this is unique in that…

1:35:24.750 --> 1:35:26.583
-[Michael] Well, I don't know.
-[all chuckling]

1:35:28.083 --> 1:35:29.833
-[Michael] I know, I left out George.
-[laughs]

1:35:53.250 --> 1:35:54.333
No, I think it's…

1:35:58.208 --> 1:35:59.250
Yeah.

1:35:59.333 --> 1:36:00.708
That's what I was thinking.

1:36:00.791 --> 1:36:02.208
[Denis chuckles]

1:36:04.958 --> 1:36:06.750
[Michael] The box thing, right?

1:36:08.250 --> 1:36:09.625
[Denis] Yeah. [chuckles]

1:36:14.833 --> 1:36:16.416
[Denis] Yeah. [chuckles]

1:36:19.708 --> 1:36:22.500
[Denis] I don't think it's practical
to do it in England. It's too bloody cold.

1:36:22.583 --> 1:36:25.458
[Michael] Yes, that was one of the reasons
we started veering off on these ideas

1:36:25.541 --> 1:36:28.208
was when we were looking at locations
that Friday after Christmas.

1:36:28.291 --> 1:36:29.708
We are in a film studio.

1:36:29.791 --> 1:36:32.958
We're going to build something so that…

1:36:33.041 --> 1:36:35.208
We shouldn't just try and build
something like the Tower Ballroom

1:36:35.291 --> 1:36:36.750
'cause we could go to the Tower Ballroom.

1:36:36.833 --> 1:36:40.416
But, once you get on a stage,
you are performers

1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:42.583
and you gotta have someone to do it to.

1:36:42.666 --> 1:36:44.375
Either the camera or real people, I think.

1:36:44.458 --> 1:36:45.458
[Paul] Yeah, we haven't--

1:36:45.541 --> 1:36:47.791
Any number we've done at the moment,
if we've noticed the camera on us

1:36:47.875 --> 1:36:49.250
we've tried to ignore it.

1:36:49.333 --> 1:36:52.708
[Michael] But you've either got to be
performing directly to the people at home

1:36:52.791 --> 1:36:54.166
or to an audience.

1:36:54.250 --> 1:36:56.208
[Paul]
See that's why I thought like a ballroom.

1:36:56.291 --> 1:36:57.750
If we did go right back.

1:36:57.833 --> 1:37:00.666
Like, "Come to the Tower Ballroom.
There's a dance on."

1:37:00.750 --> 1:37:03.708
You know?
Oh, incidentally, we'll be the band there.

1:37:03.791 --> 1:37:05.500
And then we go on
and we play all the numbers.

1:37:05.583 --> 1:37:08.166
[Michael]
But you're just not the local dance band.

1:37:08.250 --> 1:37:09.541
I don't think it's quite enough scope.

1:37:09.625 --> 1:37:11.541
[Glyn] I also think that
people are very interested

1:37:11.625 --> 1:37:13.250
in seeing how an audience would react.

1:37:13.333 --> 1:37:17.125
[Michael] Because the audience is so much
part of the first half of you, musically.

1:37:17.916 --> 1:37:21.833
[Paul] Okay, so we're all prepared
to do it with an audience.

1:37:21.916 --> 1:37:23.958
But you can't just have
the same old audience.

1:37:24.041 --> 1:37:25.416
[Denis]
What can you do that's new with them?

1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:28.208
[George] If we can just think of an image,
how we'd like to be,

1:37:28.291 --> 1:37:32.000
which could be like a nightclub act.

1:37:32.083 --> 1:37:36.333
Just the smoochy low lights
and about ten people.

1:37:36.416 --> 1:37:39.750
What's the point, when you could be
giving people happiness with a full house?

1:37:39.833 --> 1:37:41.250
Whatever kind of full house we decided.

1:37:41.333 --> 1:37:43.416
I mean, we have to think
about the audience.

1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:45.208
It really ought to be the whole world.

1:37:45.291 --> 1:37:49.000
[Denis] That's where-- Now we're going
right-- the whole circle back to Sabratha.

1:37:49.083 --> 1:37:52.791
[Michael] It is a location
which is marvelous in itself, by the sea.

1:37:52.875 --> 1:37:54.541
[Denis] What he's saying is right.

1:37:54.625 --> 1:37:55.625
It's the background.

1:37:56.500 --> 1:37:58.791
[Michael]
I don't think anything is gonna beat

1:37:58.875 --> 1:38:01.666
a perfect acoustic place
by the water, out of doors.

1:38:01.750 --> 1:38:03.166
[Ringo] For a rock and roll group?

1:38:14.916 --> 1:38:18.625
[Michael] Yes, I think we're gonna do
rock and roll at dawn or at night.

1:38:18.708 --> 1:38:20.958
I'm sure we can do rock and roll there
if we get the right audience.

1:38:21.041 --> 1:38:23.208
-George, come here.
-[George] I just wanna get it over with.

1:38:23.291 --> 1:38:25.416
-[chattering]
-[George] Yeah.

1:38:26.416 --> 1:38:27.416
-Hiya.
-Come on.

1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:28.416
[chuckling]

1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:30.541
-We're going to Africa.
-[Denis] We're off.

1:38:30.625 --> 1:38:33.500
-[Michael] We're off.
-[Paul] No, we're not. Not necessarily.

1:38:35.458 --> 1:38:36.458
[George] Where to?

1:38:37.583 --> 1:38:39.041
[all laughing]

1:38:50.041 --> 1:38:52.416
[John] See, it's like having
the most fantastic set on Earth,

1:38:52.500 --> 1:38:54.125
but we haven't made a set, you know?

1:38:54.208 --> 1:38:56.916
[Ringo] How many are gonna be looking
at the set besides us and him?

1:38:57.000 --> 1:39:00.208
[John] Every time we've done an album,
we've said, "Why are we stuck in EMI?"

1:39:00.291 --> 1:39:03.500
We could be doing it in LA.
We could be in France.

1:39:03.583 --> 1:39:05.583
And every time we do it,
and here we are again,

1:39:05.666 --> 1:39:07.625
building another bloody castle around us.

1:39:08.375 --> 1:39:10.500
-[Paul] Well said, John. Well said!
-[John] And this time we do it there.

1:39:10.583 --> 1:39:12.291
I'd be thrilled to do it.

1:39:12.375 --> 1:39:16.125
Just timing it so as the sun came up
just on the middle eight.

1:39:20.208 --> 1:39:21.666
[Michael] I think we've got to get--

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.625
[Paul] Look, we were gonna
give tickets away at this door here.

1:39:32.708 --> 1:39:35.208
We'd given out those tickets,
but they include a boat ride as well.

1:39:37.291 --> 1:39:40.208
[Paul] Okay, yeah.
We're doing a live show.

1:39:40.291 --> 1:39:42.375
And we're doing it in Arabia.

1:39:42.458 --> 1:39:43.750
[chuckles] And it's like…

1:39:43.833 --> 1:39:46.541
Whoever has been waiting
to see the lads rocking again.

1:39:46.625 --> 1:39:48.625
[George] It's just impractical to try
and get all those--

1:39:48.708 --> 1:39:49.708
But it's not, you see--

1:39:49.791 --> 1:39:52.875
Lug all them people there
and try and get all that equipment.

1:39:52.958 --> 1:39:54.583
[Paul] But then if it was their problem--

1:39:54.666 --> 1:39:57.208
[Denis] But if you say, "That's
what I want," that's what has to happen.

1:39:57.291 --> 1:39:59.625
-[John] That's not our problem.
-[George] Of course it's our problem.

1:39:59.708 --> 1:40:01.208
[Paul] Tell you what I'll offer you.

1:40:01.291 --> 1:40:05.375
If we're going away and we hire a boat
to take the audience with you…

1:40:05.458 --> 1:40:08.375
-That would be knockout.
-…we'll do a bloody show on a boat.

1:40:13.625 --> 1:40:14.833
[Michael] That's your code name.

1:40:14.916 --> 1:40:16.750
[Paul] No, he smoked some garlic once.

1:40:16.833 --> 1:40:19.666
[laughing]

1:40:19.750 --> 1:40:21.791
[Paul] So, like, I'll come in with you,

1:40:21.875 --> 1:40:24.625
as long as you can get a couple of boats.

1:40:24.708 --> 1:40:26.708
-The <i>QE 2</i>.
-[George] And then we're stuck

1:40:26.791 --> 1:40:29.333
with a bloody big boatload of people
for two weeks.

1:40:29.416 --> 1:40:33.416
At least you can go home from here.
You can get away from it all.

1:40:35.041 --> 1:40:39.666
[George] I think the idea of the boat
is completely insane.

1:40:39.750 --> 1:40:42.833
It's very expensive and insane, and…

1:40:43.750 --> 1:40:45.916
[Denis] I think it should be
the least of our worries.

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.250
Money. I really do.

1:40:48.708 --> 1:40:51.458
[John] If P&O will do a deal with Storm,
they'll do one with us.

1:40:56.208 --> 1:40:59.625
We should be able to get the boat
for the publicity they get from it.

1:41:02.833 --> 1:41:05.375
[Denis] It's gonna be great.
You'd love the place.

1:41:05.458 --> 1:41:07.791
[Ringo] I've moved to Yugoslavia!
[chuckles]

1:41:07.875 --> 1:41:12.833
I may love the place, but I'd rather
do the show, then go and love the place.

1:41:12.916 --> 1:41:14.125
[laughing]

1:41:14.208 --> 1:41:16.500
[Ringo] How're you gonna get a ship
in a couple of days?

1:41:17.833 --> 1:41:19.541
[Ringo] I was there. Yes, I know.

1:41:19.625 --> 1:41:22.833
But they were passing by
and you only used them for a few hours.

1:41:22.916 --> 1:41:25.500
I've seen it, John.
I went to the premiere.

1:41:25.583 --> 1:41:27.583
-[John] Did you enjoy it?
-[Ringo] I thought you were great.

1:41:27.666 --> 1:41:29.541
-[John] Thanks a lot, Ringo.
-[laughing]

1:41:40.333 --> 1:41:41.708
[Ringo] Still not the same.

1:41:41.791 --> 1:41:45.583
If you'll say yes, and if we get it
together, then will you go?

1:41:49.041 --> 1:41:53.625
[Michael] Well, I feel, as the trade says,
"The vibes are very good at the moment."

1:41:53.708 --> 1:41:56.375
But we can all say yes now
and somebody can decide no tomorrow.

1:41:56.458 --> 1:41:58.708
-It's not gonna make any odds.
-Yeah.

1:41:58.791 --> 1:42:01.000
-[Ringo] Good night, everybody!
-[Michael] Good night, Russia.

1:42:01.083 --> 1:42:02.916
-[Ringo] That's a wrap.
-[Denis] I'll see you in Sabratha!

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:04.958
[John] Let's pretend I wasn't here again.

-No.

[Michael speaks indistinctly]

1:42:22.291 --> 1:42:23.583
