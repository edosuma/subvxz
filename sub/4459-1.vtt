01:52.761 --> 01:56.388
Lord Henry Wotton had set
himself early in life to the serious study...

01:56.598 --> 02:00.935
...of the great aristocratic art
of doing absolutely nothing.

02:01.144 --> 02:02.770
He lived only for pleasure...

02:02.979 --> 02:05.940
...but his greatest pleasure was to observe
the emotions of his friends...

02:06.107 --> 02:09.318
...while experiencing none of his own.

02:09.527 --> 02:15.115
He diverted himself by exercising
a subtle influence on the lives of others.

02:17.994 --> 02:20.371
Eighteen, I think you said, sir.

02:22.999 --> 02:25.459
- Shall I wait, sir?
- Yes.

02:29.089 --> 02:32.758
Among Lord Henry's friends
was the painter Basil Hallward.

02:32.968 --> 02:35.844
He had been strangely secretive
about his latest painting...

02:36.054 --> 02:37.972
...and Lord Henry, sensing a mystery...

02:38.181 --> 02:42.434
...determined to discover what it was
that his friend wished to conceal.

02:43.687 --> 02:46.939
Uh, I'm sorry, my lord,
Mr. Hallward is not at home.

02:47.983 --> 02:50.985
Mr. Hallward doesn't wish to be disturbed.

03:13.717 --> 03:17.011
It's your best work, Basil.
The best thing you've ever done.

03:17.220 --> 03:20.347
Of course, I can't believe that anyone
is really as handsome as that portrait.

03:20.557 --> 03:23.225
Who is he? What's his name?
Why are you being so secretive about it?

03:23.435 --> 03:24.435
It's a great painting.

03:24.644 --> 03:27.146
You ought to send it to the Grosvenor
and let everyone admire it.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.982
- I shall not send it anywhere.
- But why?

03:30.191 --> 03:32.693
- I've put too much of myself into it.
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:32.902 --> 03:36.196
I knew you'd laugh,
but it's true all the same.

03:36.406 --> 03:40.034
Well, there certainly isn't any resemblance
between you and this young Adonis.

03:40.243 --> 03:44.204
You have an intellectual expression,
and intellect destroys the beauty of any face.

03:44.414 --> 03:47.082
Don't flatter yourself, Basil.
You're not in the least like him.

03:47.292 --> 03:50.711
Of course I'm not like him.
And I'm glad of it.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.505
"The Wisdom of Buddha."

03:53.715 --> 03:56.008
You always did have
a passion for virtue, Basil.

03:56.217 --> 03:57.760
Why are you glad you're not like him?

03:57.969 --> 04:00.054
We suffer for what the gods give us...

04:00.263 --> 04:02.931
...and I'm afraid Dorian Gray will pay
for his good looks.

04:03.141 --> 04:05.893
Dorian Gray. Is that his name?

04:06.102 --> 04:09.021
Yes. I didn't intend to tell it to you.

04:11.566 --> 04:14.485
If I'm going to keep visiting you,
I'll have to send some good sherry.

04:14.694 --> 04:17.821
- Why didn't you intend to tell me his name?
- I can't explain.

04:18.031 --> 04:20.783
As I've grown older,
I've come to love secrecy.

04:20.992 --> 04:22.743
I suppose that sounds foolish to you.

04:22.952 --> 04:26.497
Come into the garden.
It doesn't sound foolish to me at all.

04:26.706 --> 04:29.416
You forget that I am married
and that the one charm of marriage...

04:29.626 --> 04:33.045
...is that it makes a life of deception
absolutely necessary to both parties.

04:33.254 --> 04:35.672
I believe you are really
a very good husband, Harry...

04:35.882 --> 04:38.550
...but that you are thoroughly ashamed
of your own virtues.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.470
- Your cynicism is simply a pose.
- Being natural is simply a pose...

04:41.679 --> 04:44.681
...and the most irritating pose I know.
But you haven't answered my question.

04:44.891 --> 04:48.185
I want to know the real reason why
you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.

04:48.395 --> 04:52.439
There is really very little to tell, Harry.
Besides, I'm afraid you will hardly believe it.

04:52.649 --> 04:55.109
I can believe anything provided
that it is quite incredible.

04:55.318 --> 04:57.319
I'm afraid this will seem so.

04:57.529 --> 05:01.615
There is something I can't quite understand.

05:01.825 --> 05:04.743
- Something mystic about it.
- Mystic?

05:04.953 --> 05:08.622
I don't know how to explain it,
but whenever Dorian poses for me...

05:08.832 --> 05:12.543
...it seems as if a power outside myself
were guiding my hand.

05:12.752 --> 05:17.423
It's as if the painting had a life of its own,
independent of me.

05:17.632 --> 05:19.675
That's why I'm not going to exhibit it.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.302
It belongs rightfully to Dorian,
and I shall give it to him.

05:22.512 --> 05:25.931
I want to meet this extraordinary young man.
I think we shall be friends.

05:26.141 --> 05:29.351
I choose my friends for their good looks
and my enemies for their good intellects.

05:29.561 --> 05:31.979
A man cannot be too careful
in his choice of enemies.

05:32.188 --> 05:35.524
Harry, I despise your principles,
but I do enjoy the way you express them.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.317
I like persons better than principles...

05:37.527 --> 05:40.154
...and persons with no principles
better than anything else.

05:40.363 --> 05:42.823
- Now I remember.
- Remember what, Harry?

05:43.032 --> 05:47.661
- Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.
- Where was it?

05:47.871 --> 05:50.622
Well, don't look so startled.
It was at my Aunt Agatha's.

05:50.832 --> 05:53.333
My aunt told me that she had discovered
a wonderful young man...

05:53.543 --> 05:56.545
...who was going to help with her charities
and that his name was Dorian Gray.

05:56.754 --> 06:00.048
I pictured somebody
with spectacles and lank hair...

06:00.258 --> 06:02.634
...tramping about on huge feet,
and so I avoided meeting him.

06:02.844 --> 06:04.470
That's a very common type of butterfly.

06:04.679 --> 06:07.681
Limenitis sibylla.
It hardly belongs in a gentleman's garden.

06:07.891 --> 06:10.726
- I'm glad you didn't meet Dorian Gray.
- Why?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.853
I don't want you to meet him.

06:16.691 --> 06:18.650
Who's that at your piano, Basil?

06:33.917 --> 06:36.210
- You've come early today, Dorian.
- Have I?

06:36.419 --> 06:38.712
You must lend me these pieces, Basil.
I want to learn them.

06:38.922 --> 06:40.714
Depends on how you sit this afternoon.

06:40.924 --> 06:42.799
I thought the picture was going
to be done today.

06:43.009 --> 06:44.218
It will be.

06:44.427 --> 06:46.762
Please go on, Mr. Gray.
You play brilliantly.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.598
This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian.
An old Oxford friend of mine.

06:49.807 --> 06:51.391
My aunt has spoken to me about you.

06:51.601 --> 06:54.269
You are one of her favorites
and one of her victims too.

06:54.479 --> 06:57.689
- You shouldn't go in for philanthropy.
- Harry, I want to finish this picture.

06:57.899 --> 06:59.858
Would you think it rude
if I asked you to go away?

07:00.068 --> 07:01.151
Am I to go, Mr. Gray?

07:01.361 --> 07:04.404
- Stay and tell me why not philanthropy.
- You don't really mind, do you, Basil?

07:04.614 --> 07:07.491
You've told me that you liked your sitters
to have someone to chat to.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.993
Sit down then, Harry.

07:10.203 --> 07:11.870
Now, Dorian, get up on the platform...

07:12.080 --> 07:14.331
...and don't pay any attention
to what Lord Henry says.

07:14.541 --> 07:18.585
He has a bad influence over his friends,
with the single exception of myself.

07:18.795 --> 07:20.837
Have you really a bad influence, Lord Henry?

07:21.047 --> 07:23.757
There's no such thing
as a good influence, Mr. Gray.

07:23.967 --> 07:26.635
- All influence is immoral.
- Why?

07:26.844 --> 07:29.137
Because the aim of life is self-development.

07:29.347 --> 07:32.015
To realize one's nature perfectly.

07:32.225 --> 07:34.226
That's what we're here for.

07:34.435 --> 07:36.770
A man should live out his life
fully and completely...

07:36.980 --> 07:39.982
...give form to every feeling,
expression to every thought...

07:40.191 --> 07:42.025
...reality to every dream.

07:42.235 --> 07:46.196
Every impulse that we suppress
broods in the mind and poisons us.

07:46.406 --> 07:50.242
There's only one way to get rid
of a temptation and that's to yield to it.

07:50.451 --> 07:52.995
Resist it and the soul grows sick...

07:53.204 --> 07:56.373
...with longing for the things
it has forbidden to itself.

07:56.583 --> 08:00.252
There is nothing that can cure the soul
but the senses.

08:00.461 --> 08:04.631
Just as there is nothing that can cure
the senses but the soul.

08:04.841 --> 08:07.467
Turn your head a little more
to the left, Dorian.

08:07.677 --> 08:09.636
The gods have been good to you, Mr. Gray.

08:09.846 --> 08:10.887
Why do you say that?

08:11.097 --> 08:12.639
You have the most marvelous youth...

08:12.849 --> 08:15.976
...and youth is the one thing worth having.
- I don't feel that, Lord Henry.

08:16.185 --> 08:18.604
You don't feel it now,
but some day you'll feel it terribly.

08:18.813 --> 08:21.315
What the gods give,
they quickly take away.

08:21.524 --> 08:23.483
Time is jealous of you, Mr. Gray.

08:23.693 --> 08:27.529
Don't squander the gold of your days.
Live. Let nothing be lost upon you.

08:27.739 --> 08:29.323
Be afraid of nothing.

08:29.532 --> 08:32.075
There is such a little time
that your youth will last...

08:32.285 --> 08:33.952
...and you can never get it back.

08:34.162 --> 08:35.829
As we grow older,
our memories are haunted...

08:36.039 --> 08:40.375
...by the exquisite temptations
we hadn't the courage to yield to.

08:40.585 --> 08:42.419
The world is yours for a season.

08:42.629 --> 08:45.380
It would be tragic if you realized too late...

08:45.590 --> 08:47.466
...as so many others do...

08:47.675 --> 08:52.596
...that there is only one thing in the world
worth having, and that is youth.

08:53.264 --> 08:57.559
Dorian Gray had never heard
the praise of folly so eloquently expressed.

08:57.769 --> 09:01.021
The creed of pleasure
soared into a philosophy of life...

09:01.230 --> 09:04.691
...while Dorian stood
as if he were under a spell.

09:04.901 --> 09:09.404
He felt afraid of Lord Henry's ideas
and ashamed of himself for being afraid.

09:09.614 --> 09:12.658
It was as if he were learning
to know himself for the first time...

09:12.867 --> 09:17.204
...as if a stranger had revealed
his own most secret thoughts to him.

09:17.413 --> 09:20.832
For the first time
he became conscious of his youth...

09:21.042 --> 09:25.170
...and conscious of the fact that one day
he would lose it.

09:26.047 --> 09:27.547
My visit hasn't been wasted.

09:27.757 --> 09:30.217
I've found a rare and beautiful butterfly,
Euvanesse antiope.

09:30.426 --> 09:33.887
It's very unusual in England.
Don't you think it's beautiful, Mr. Gray?

09:34.472 --> 09:37.683
- Yes, Lord Henry, very beautiful.
- You may sit down now, Dorian.

09:37.892 --> 09:39.309
I'm glad you met Lord Henry.

09:39.519 --> 09:42.062
- Are you glad, Mr. Gray?
- I'm glad now.

09:42.271 --> 09:45.107
- I wonder if I shall always be glad.
- "Always"?

09:45.316 --> 09:47.984
That's a dreadful word.
It makes me shudder to hear it.

09:48.194 --> 09:49.361
Women are so fond of using it.

09:49.570 --> 09:52.406
They spoil every romance
by trying to make it last forever.

09:52.615 --> 09:55.242
The only difference between a caprice
and a life-long passion is...

09:55.451 --> 09:56.868
...the caprice lasts a little longer.

09:57.078 --> 09:59.246
But I believe our hostess has appeared.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.586
You're just in time, darling...

10:06.796 --> 10:08.922
...to witness my signature
to Dorian's painting.

10:09.132 --> 10:10.507
Could I sign it too?

10:10.717 --> 10:13.552
Well, I think you're entitled to.
Since you haven't missed a sitting.

10:13.761 --> 10:15.095
Here.

10:15.888 --> 10:17.639
G for Gladys.

10:19.016 --> 10:21.685
Which do you prefer, Gladys,
Dorian Gray or his picture?

10:21.894 --> 10:23.770
I like Dorian best.

10:23.980 --> 10:26.648
Heh. You prefer him today,
but when you are a young lady...

10:26.858 --> 10:29.901
...and are turning all the heads in London,
you may prefer the portrait.

10:30.111 --> 10:33.113
For it will look just as it does today,
but we shall all be changed.

10:33.322 --> 10:36.908
And not for the better.
Your uncle and I and even Dorian.

10:37.660 --> 10:38.952
Dorian won't change.

10:39.162 --> 10:41.955
Dorian will stay just as he is until I'm grown.

10:42.165 --> 10:44.249
Won't you, Dorian?

10:45.209 --> 10:46.752
Of course I shall, darling.

10:46.961 --> 10:51.173
You may say goodbye now, precious.
Nanny's waiting. Come along. Hurry.

10:52.633 --> 10:55.010
- On your way.
- What about me, young lady?

10:55.219 --> 10:57.471
Has Dorian Gray stolen you
from me completely?

10:57.680 --> 11:00.015
- Goodbye, Lord Henry.
- Heh.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.310
When this is known, I shall be torn to shreds
in every drawing room in London.

11:03.853 --> 11:06.146
Don't you think
a gentleman should remove his hat...

11:06.355 --> 11:07.939
...in the presence of a lady, Parker?

11:10.151 --> 11:13.570
I never take off my hat
except when I'm out of doors.

11:13.780 --> 11:16.615
She'll be as lovely
as your sister was, Basil.

11:17.283 --> 11:18.742
Yes.

11:18.951 --> 11:21.995
But I'm afraid Dorian has stolen
her heart from me too.

11:22.205 --> 11:27.334
I must congratulate you, Basil.
Look at yourself, Mr. Gray.

11:49.398 --> 11:53.109
As I grow old,
this picture will remain always young.

11:57.073 --> 11:58.782
If it were only the other way.

11:58.991 --> 12:03.119
If it were I who was always to be young
and the picture that was to grow old.

12:03.329 --> 12:05.372
You would hardly care
for such an arrangement, Basil.

12:05.581 --> 12:08.208
- It would be hard lines on your work.
- I should object strongly.

12:08.417 --> 12:11.545
You oughtn't to express such a wish
in the presence of that cat, Dorian.

12:11.754 --> 12:15.006
It's one of the 73 great gods of Egypt
and is quite capable of granting your wish.

12:16.926 --> 12:18.343
Lord Henry is right.

12:18.553 --> 12:21.054
I know now that when one loses one's youth,
one loses everything.

12:22.181 --> 12:26.142
Perhaps a cup of tea will bring you around.
You'll have some, too, won't you, Harry?

12:26.352 --> 12:28.311
Or do you object
to such simple pleasures?

12:28.521 --> 12:31.690
I adore simple pleasures.
They're the last refuge of the complex.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.860
It's more than a painting.
It's part of myself.

12:35.069 --> 12:38.321
As soon as you're varnished and framed,
Dorian, you will be sent home.

12:38.531 --> 12:40.240
You can do whatever you like
with yourself.

12:40.449 --> 12:44.160
Better send along the Egyptian cat. The god
and the picture shouldn't be separated.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.538
I will, if Dorian wants it.

12:47.707 --> 12:52.002
If only the picture could change,
and I could be always what I am now.

12:52.211 --> 12:53.795
For that I would give everything.

12:54.005 --> 12:57.007
Yes, there's nothing in the whole world
I would not give.

12:57.216 --> 12:59.217
I would give my soul for that.

13:11.606 --> 13:14.691
Dorian began to venture alone
on warm summer evenings...

13:14.942 --> 13:17.777
...into surroundings
which were strange to him.

13:21.198 --> 13:24.743
Filled with curiosity about places
and people remote from his own experience...

13:24.952 --> 13:27.787
...he wandered to the half-world of London...

13:27.997 --> 13:31.458
...the words of Lord Henry
vibrating in his mind.

13:31.667 --> 13:36.129
"Live. Let nothing be lost upon you.
Be afraid of nothing."

14:01.656 --> 14:04.240
The Two Turtles is honored
by the visit of a gentleman.

14:09.121 --> 14:10.872
If you please, sir.

14:50.913 --> 14:53.915
I give you the sweetheart
of the Two Turtles.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.876
Our own Sibyl Vane!

15:11.684 --> 15:17.522
Snow was very plentiful
And crumbs were very few

15:17.732 --> 15:19.774
When a weather-beaten sparrow

15:20.026 --> 15:24.154
Through a mansion window flew

15:24.363 --> 15:28.074
Her eye fell on a golden cage

15:28.284 --> 15:32.454
A sweet love song she heard

15:32.663 --> 15:36.082
Sung by a pet canary there

15:36.292 --> 15:40.628
A handsome yellow bird

15:40.838 --> 15:45.884
He said to her, "Miss Sparrow
I've been struck by Cupid's arrow

15:46.093 --> 15:50.930
Will you share my cage with me?"

15:51.766 --> 15:54.934
She looked up at his castle

15:55.144 --> 15:58.938
With its ribbon and its tassel

15:59.106 --> 16:05.445
And in plaintive tones said she

16:06.947 --> 16:10.617
"Goodbye, little yellow bird

16:10.826 --> 16:14.579
I'd rather brave the cold

16:14.789 --> 16:17.457
On a leafless tree

16:17.666 --> 16:21.336
Than a prisoner be

16:21.545 --> 16:26.424
In a cage of gold"

16:29.345 --> 16:32.305
I'd gladly introduce you, sir,
but she's proud.

16:32.515 --> 16:34.432
She won't meet anybody.

16:38.479 --> 16:40.146
Come, my delightful dove.

16:40.356 --> 16:44.150
Descend and make a pilgrimage
with me among these mortals.

16:50.116 --> 16:53.368
The spoiled and petted yellow bird

16:53.577 --> 16:56.496
Could scarce believe it true

16:56.705 --> 17:00.125
That a common sparrow should refuse

17:00.334 --> 17:04.337
A bird with blood so blue

17:04.547 --> 17:10.343
He told her the advantages
Of riches and of gold

17:10.553 --> 17:13.805
She answered that her liberty

17:14.014 --> 17:18.101
For gold could not be sold

17:18.310 --> 17:22.647
She said, "I must be going"
But he cried, "No, no, it's snowing

17:22.857 --> 17:27.735
And the wintry winds so blow

17:27.945 --> 17:31.156
Stay with me, my little dearie

17:31.365 --> 17:35.326
For without you, it would be dreary"

17:35.536 --> 17:41.207
But she only sighed, "Ah, no"

17:42.835 --> 17:45.712
"Goodbye, little yellow bird

17:47.089 --> 17:51.384
I'd gladly mate with you

17:51.594 --> 17:55.722
I love you, little yellow bird

17:55.931 --> 18:00.351
But I love my freedom too

18:00.561 --> 18:04.814
So goodbye, little yellow bird

18:05.024 --> 18:09.402
I'd rather brave the cold

18:09.612 --> 18:12.572
On a leafless tree

18:12.781 --> 18:16.409
Than a prisoner be

18:16.619 --> 18:19.579
In a cage

18:19.788 --> 18:23.625
Of gold"

18:38.641 --> 18:42.685
She's taken with you, sir.
Say the word and I'll take you backstage.

18:42.895 --> 18:44.562
Thank you, no.

18:48.192 --> 18:52.654
Night after night Dorian went
to the Two Turtles to watch Sibyl Vane.

18:52.863 --> 18:55.114
A patron of the arts, Mrs. Vane.

18:55.324 --> 18:58.034
He's come to the Two Turtles
each evening for a fortnight.

18:58.244 --> 19:01.287
He wants to tell you
how much he admires your daughter.

19:03.415 --> 19:06.125
If you will permit me,
I have a request to make.

19:06.335 --> 19:08.002
You're very kind, sir.

19:08.212 --> 19:12.298
Miss Vane, will you sing
"The Little Yellow Bird" for me now?

19:12.508 --> 19:14.342
She will, sir, gladly.

19:14.551 --> 19:17.428
But there's no one to play for me.
Everyone's gone.

19:17.638 --> 19:19.889
I think I might manage
the accompaniment.

19:20.099 --> 19:22.350
You will, won't you, dearie?

19:23.602 --> 19:24.978
Yes.

19:26.438 --> 19:28.523
On one condition.

19:31.652 --> 19:32.944
Please.

19:38.534 --> 19:41.577
I apologize for my daughter.

19:51.338 --> 19:56.050
So goodbye, little yellow bird

19:56.260 --> 20:00.888
I'd rather brave the cold

20:01.098 --> 20:04.309
On a leafless tree

20:04.518 --> 20:08.271
Than a prisoner be

20:08.480 --> 20:14.527
In a cage of gold

21:48.997 --> 21:52.792
It's wonderful. Did...? Did you write it?

21:55.462 --> 21:58.464
Frederic Chopin wrote it
for a woman he loved.

21:58.674 --> 22:01.926
Her name was George Sand.
Someday I'll tell you about them.

22:02.136 --> 22:03.886
I should like that.

22:11.019 --> 22:12.603
What did the music mean to you?

22:13.772 --> 22:17.567
I don't know. It is full of emotion.

22:17.776 --> 22:19.527
But it's not happy.

22:19.736 --> 22:22.029
No, it's not happy.

22:22.239 --> 22:23.948
Why was he unhappy?

22:30.581 --> 22:33.541
Perhaps because he felt
his youth slipping away from him.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.377
- What an odd thing for you to say.
- Why?

22:36.587 --> 22:40.006
- You are so young.
- Yes.

22:40.507 --> 22:41.924
And you also.

22:45.345 --> 22:48.473
What is the music called? Has it a name?

22:48.682 --> 22:53.019
A kind of name. It is called "Prelude."

23:35.187 --> 23:38.064
- Is this the way you watch Sibyl, Mother?
- You don't understand, James.

23:38.273 --> 23:39.941
I wish I wasn't going to Australia.

23:40.150 --> 23:42.235
I'd cancel it
if my articles hadn't been signed.

23:42.444 --> 23:45.613
I want Sibyl to make a brilliant marriage.
Actresses marry into the upper classes.

23:45.822 --> 23:48.449
- I almost did myself.
- Who is this young dandy? What's his name?

23:48.659 --> 23:50.409
Oh, I don't know his name, but he's rich.

23:50.619 --> 23:52.578
What's his name, Sibyl?
How often has he been here?

23:52.788 --> 23:54.789
- What are his intentions?
- I don't know.

23:54.998 --> 23:58.417
But I do know his name. It is Sir Tristan.

23:58.627 --> 24:00.753
You don't know his name
and yet you permitted him to...

24:00.963 --> 24:04.048
Your brother's right, Sibyl, you ought
not to have permitted such familiarity.

24:04.258 --> 24:06.842
He is good. I know it.
There is no evil in him.

24:07.052 --> 24:08.803
- Did you see his face?
- No, but I wish I had.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.639
If he ever does you any wrong,
I'll track him down and kill him.

24:11.848 --> 24:14.850
Jim! You're foolish, Jim. Utterly foolish.

24:15.060 --> 24:17.478
You talk like one of the melodramas
Mother used to act in.

24:17.688 --> 24:21.399
That was when acting was understood.
I received a lot of attention in those days.

24:21.608 --> 24:25.111
All I say is watch over Sibyl, Mother.
Watch over her while I'm gone.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.612
Jim.

24:36.164 --> 24:37.748
You're going away tonight.

24:37.958 --> 24:41.335
The ship will take you far away
over the dark waters.

24:41.545 --> 24:44.547
Don't let me remember you
angry and troubled.

24:54.600 --> 24:55.933
That's better.

24:57.394 --> 24:59.478
Can't you read what people are
in their faces?

25:02.107 --> 25:04.817
You think I'm silly
when I call him Sir Tristan.

25:05.027 --> 25:07.153
But to me he's like
one of King Arthur's knights...

25:07.362 --> 25:09.822
...that we used to read about
when we were children...

25:10.032 --> 25:14.619
...who took the vow of chivalry
to battle against all evil-doers.

25:14.828 --> 25:17.747
To defend the right to protect all women.

25:17.956 --> 25:21.083
To be true in friendship
and faithful in love.

25:23.545 --> 25:27.757
You can't go wrong with this one, sir.
I've never heard a sweeter warbler.

25:41.438 --> 25:42.855
Little yellow bird.

25:46.234 --> 25:48.694
- Late as usual, Harry.
- Please forgive me, Aunt Agatha.

25:48.904 --> 25:51.197
Punctuality is the thief of time, Harry says.

25:51.406 --> 25:53.991
Victoria, darling, how nice.

25:55.243 --> 25:56.869
I love coming to your house, Aunt Agatha.

25:57.079 --> 25:59.497
It's one of the few places
I'm likely to meet my husband.

26:00.874 --> 26:02.208
Oh, I'm always dropping it.

26:02.417 --> 26:04.835
Mr. Gray has something terribly important
to tell you, Harry.

26:05.045 --> 26:06.420
We're all dying to learn what it is.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.548
I imagine it can wait
until luncheon is over.

26:09.758 --> 26:11.550
I'm vexed with you, Harry.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.553
Why do you try to persuade Mr. Gray
to give up the East End?

26:14.763 --> 26:17.598
He's a wonderful musician,
and they love his playing.

26:17.808 --> 26:20.059
The East End is a very important problem.

26:20.268 --> 26:25.064
Quite so. It's the problem of slavery,
and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.

26:25.273 --> 26:27.400
I suspect we're interested in the poor...

26:27.609 --> 26:29.193
...in order to amuse ourselves.

26:29.403 --> 26:32.405
Especially as we grow older
and are unfit for other amusements.

26:32.614 --> 26:35.241
Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me
how to become young again.

26:35.450 --> 26:38.244
Can you remember any great errors
that you committed in your early days?

26:38.453 --> 26:40.454
- A great many, I fear.
- Then commit them over again.

26:40.664 --> 26:43.207
To regain one's youth,
one has merely to repeat one's follies.

26:43.417 --> 26:44.417
A delightful theory.

26:44.626 --> 26:47.169
- A dangerous theory.
- One of the great secrets of life.

26:47.379 --> 26:49.380
Most people die
of a creeping common sense...

26:49.589 --> 26:52.800
...and discover too late that the only things
one never regrets are one's mistakes.

26:53.009 --> 26:56.262
But surely if one lives for oneself,
one pays a terrible price for doing so.

26:56.471 --> 26:58.264
Yes, we are overcharged for everything now.

26:58.473 --> 27:01.892
- One has to pay in other ways than money.
- What sort of ways, Sir Thomas?

27:02.102 --> 27:07.022
I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in...
Well, in the consciousness of degradation.

27:07.232 --> 27:09.358
No civilized man ever regrets a pleasure...

27:09.568 --> 27:12.069
...and no uncivilized man
ever knows what a pleasure is.

27:12.279 --> 27:14.488
I know what pleasure is.
It's to adore someone.

27:14.698 --> 27:17.366
In that case, I think I can guess
what it is you have to tell me.

27:20.078 --> 27:22.037
But adoring someone is better
than being adored.

27:22.247 --> 27:24.248
Being adored is a nuisance.
You will discover...

27:24.458 --> 27:26.959
...that women treat us
just as humanity treats its gods.

27:27.169 --> 27:29.879
They worship us and keep bothering us
to do something for them.

27:30.088 --> 27:31.630
Harry, you're incorrigible.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.508
You must admit that women give men
the very gold of their lives.

27:34.718 --> 27:36.969
But they invariably want it back
in such small change.

27:37.179 --> 27:39.013
Women, as a witty Frenchman put it...

27:39.222 --> 27:42.641
...inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces
and prevent us from carrying them out.

27:42.851 --> 27:43.809
I don't understand you.

27:44.019 --> 27:46.353
You seem to know us women awfully well,
Lord Henry.

27:46.563 --> 27:48.272
I am analyzing women at present.

27:48.482 --> 27:50.858
The subject is less difficult
than I was led to believe.

27:51.067 --> 27:53.486
Women represent
the triumph of matter over mind...

27:53.695 --> 27:57.406
...just as men represent
the triumph of mind over morals.

27:57.616 --> 27:59.992
These views are horrifying, Lady Agatha.

28:00.202 --> 28:02.787
I did not expect to hear
the devil's advocate at your table.

28:02.996 --> 28:05.372
I apologize for the intelligence
of my remarks, Sir Thomas.

28:05.582 --> 28:08.584
I'd forgotten that you were
a member of parliament.

28:10.796 --> 28:13.839
You will forgive me, Lady Agatha,
if I leave at once.

28:14.049 --> 28:16.634
Before the quail, Sir Thomas?
The first quail of the season?

28:16.843 --> 28:18.344
I ordered them especially for you.

28:18.553 --> 28:20.721
No, surely not before the quail, Sir Thomas.

28:20.931 --> 28:23.974
Think with the Liberals and eat with the Tories.
Isn't that the rule?

28:24.184 --> 28:27.186
How men argue. I can never
make out what they're talking about.

28:27.395 --> 28:28.979
Do sit down, Sir Thomas.

28:29.147 --> 28:31.899
Lord Henry's ideas
are demoralizing and delightful.

28:32.108 --> 28:34.610
They're not to be taken seriously.

28:47.958 --> 28:51.794
I confess,
I never could resist Lady Agatha's quail.

28:53.755 --> 28:56.340
Well, Dorian, what have you to tell me
that is so important?

28:56.550 --> 28:59.468
From what you said at luncheon,
my guess is that you've fallen in love.

28:59.678 --> 29:01.720
I'm engaged to be married.

29:09.896 --> 29:12.481
Now that we're on our way,
perhaps you'll tell me where we're going.

29:12.691 --> 29:15.234
- Grosvenor Square, Number Seven.
- It's Dorian we're going to see?

29:15.443 --> 29:18.654
We're going to pick him up and then see
the young woman he's engaged to marry.

29:18.864 --> 29:22.449
- Dorian engaged? To whom, Harry?
- To an actress in a cheap vaudeville.

29:22.659 --> 29:24.827
An actress.
With dyed hair and a painted face?

29:25.036 --> 29:26.704
Don't run down dyed hair
and painted faces.

29:26.913 --> 29:30.332
- There's an extraordinary charm in them.
- But surely you can't be serious.

29:30.542 --> 29:33.836
- I hope I shall never be more serious.
- You don't approve.

29:34.045 --> 29:37.548
- You can't possibly.
- I never approve or disapprove of anything.

29:37.757 --> 29:40.801
Dorian falls in love with a beautiful girl
and proposes to marry her. Why not?

29:41.011 --> 29:42.261
Every experience is of value.

29:42.470 --> 29:45.180
Whatever can be said against marriage,
it's certainly an experience.

29:45.390 --> 29:46.849
Dorian will make this girl his wife.

29:47.058 --> 29:49.435
Six months later,
he'll become infatuated with someone else.

29:49.644 --> 29:53.063
- You think he could be so unfaithful?
- Faithfulness is merely laziness.

29:53.273 --> 29:55.941
Number Seven, sir.

29:57.319 --> 29:58.903
I've been watching for you.

29:59.112 --> 30:00.779
Go to Lower Euston Road, Number 22.

30:00.989 --> 30:02.239
Lower Euston Road, sir?

30:02.449 --> 30:04.575
- Lower Euston Road.
- Yes, sir.

30:07.203 --> 30:10.873
They're always surprised
when I give them that address. Hurry.

30:11.082 --> 30:13.459
I want you to get there in time
to meet her before she sings.

30:13.668 --> 30:16.462
I hope you'll always be as happy
as you are at this moment, Dorian.

30:16.671 --> 30:19.131
Thank you, Basil.
Our engagement is still a dead secret.

30:19.341 --> 30:22.009
- She's not even told her mother.
- What will your guardian say?

30:22.218 --> 30:24.470
Lord Radley will be furious.
But there's nothing he can do.

30:24.679 --> 30:25.971
May I ask you a question?

30:26.181 --> 30:28.307
At what particular point
did you mention marriage?

30:28.516 --> 30:30.142
I didn't make any formal proposal, Harry.

30:30.352 --> 30:33.312
I told her I loved her, and she said
she was not worthy to be my wife.

30:33.521 --> 30:36.273
- "Not worthy."
- Women are wonderfully practical.

30:36.483 --> 30:40.319
In situations of that kind, we often forget to say
anything about marriage and they remind us.

30:40.528 --> 30:42.488
Sibyl has made me forget
your poisonous theories.

30:42.697 --> 30:44.990
- Which theories?
- Your theories about life, about pleasure.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.493
Pleasure is the only thing
worth having a theory about.

30:47.702 --> 30:49.203
It's nature's sign of approval.

30:49.412 --> 30:52.790
When we're happy, we're always good.
When we're good, we're not always happy.

30:52.999 --> 30:54.959
Sibyl is the answer
to all your cynicism, Harry.

30:55.168 --> 30:57.336
I believe you'll understand that
when you see her.

30:57.545 --> 31:01.715
So goodbye, little yellow bird

31:01.925 --> 31:06.470
I'd rather brave the cold

31:06.680 --> 31:09.473
On a leafless tree

31:09.683 --> 31:13.519
Than a prisoner be

31:13.728 --> 31:20.526
In a cage of gold

31:32.080 --> 31:34.456
This marriage is quite right.
I didn't think so at first...

31:34.666 --> 31:36.542
...but the moment we met her,
I was convinced.

31:36.751 --> 31:38.919
She's charming and innocent,
transparently so.

31:39.129 --> 31:43.132
- I knew you would say that.
- She's all that you say, but I don't agree.

31:45.176 --> 31:47.594
I believe she loves you so much,
you have no need to marry her.

31:47.804 --> 31:49.972
What wickedness
are you contemplating now?

31:50.181 --> 31:52.516
I ought to be angry with you, Harry,
but I'm much too happy.

31:52.726 --> 31:54.643
All I know is that Sibyl is sacred to me.

31:54.853 --> 31:57.062
It's only the sacred things
that are worth touching.

31:57.272 --> 32:00.065
I begin to find you disgusting.
Don't listen to him, Dorian.

32:00.275 --> 32:03.068
Don't worry, Basil.
I'm immune to his ideas now.

32:03.278 --> 32:06.321
In that case, I needn't tell you how
I should proceed if I were in your place.

32:06.531 --> 32:08.240
What would you do? I'm curious to know.

32:08.450 --> 32:11.952
Well, I should invite her to come
to my house to see Basil's portrait.

32:12.162 --> 32:14.913
When she said it was time for her to go,
I should ask her not to leave.

32:15.123 --> 32:17.750
She'd be shocked, of course.
I'd pretend to be disappointed in her.

32:17.959 --> 32:20.252
If she still wished to go,
I'd become cold and indifferent.

32:20.462 --> 32:22.588
I'd, uh, ask her to let herself out...

32:22.797 --> 32:25.591
...saying that I couldn't bear sad farewells.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.677
But if she left, then I'd believe her
to be as good as she is beautiful...

32:28.887 --> 32:31.138
...and I'd beg her forgiveness
and marry her.

32:31.347 --> 32:33.390
I've always thought
your wickedness a pose.

32:33.600 --> 32:36.894
I know better now.
You're an unmitigated cad.

32:37.729 --> 32:40.189
Will you try my experiment, Dorian?

32:44.152 --> 32:47.780
Miss Vane. Miss Vane, has Sir Tristan,
as you have so charmingly called him...

32:47.989 --> 32:51.617
...ever invited you to see the wonderful portrait
that Basil Hallward has made of him?

32:51.826 --> 32:54.870
No, he hasn't. I should love to see it. May I?

32:55.580 --> 32:58.207
Of course you may, darling.
Tonight, if you wish.

33:15.350 --> 33:19.853
I shall always remember this room,
just as it is now.

33:20.730 --> 33:25.859
The lamplight, you at the piano,
my own happiness.

33:42.752 --> 33:45.212
Your clock thinks
it's time for me to go home.

33:45.421 --> 33:47.172
Clocks can't help being disagreeable.

33:47.382 --> 33:49.508
They think it's their duty.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.184
It's that cat.

33:59.394 --> 34:01.687
I thought I saw its eyes move.

34:02.188 --> 34:03.730
Perhaps you did.

34:03.940 --> 34:06.775
Lord Henry says it's one
of the 73 great gods of Egypt.

34:06.985 --> 34:11.405
- Doesn't it frighten you?
- It does a little. Listen to this.

34:12.740 --> 34:17.369
Dawn follows Dawn, and Nights grow old
And all the while this curious cat

34:17.579 --> 34:22.791
Lies couching on the Chinese mat
With eyes of satin rimmed with gold.

34:23.001 --> 34:26.795
Get hence, you loathsome mystery!
Hideous animal, get hence!

34:27.005 --> 34:31.550
You wake in me each bestial sense
You make me what I would not be.

34:31.759 --> 34:34.303
You make my creed a barren sham

34:34.512 --> 34:40.767
You wake foul dreams of sensual life

34:51.613 --> 34:54.656
What a strange poem. Who wrote it?

34:54.866 --> 34:57.034
A brilliant young Irishman out of Oxford.

34:57.243 --> 34:59.453
His name is Oscar Wilde.

35:04.626 --> 35:06.835
Why do you look at me so strangely?

35:07.837 --> 35:11.673
What would you do, Sibyl,
if I should say to you...

35:11.883 --> 35:15.010
..."Don't leave me now, don't go home"?

35:26.397 --> 35:27.898
What would you do, Sibyl?

35:58.221 --> 36:01.223
I suppose I should have expected
a conventional reaction.

36:03.559 --> 36:04.935
Good night, then.

36:06.896 --> 36:08.397
Good night.

36:09.315 --> 36:13.485
You don't mind letting yourself out, do you?
I can't bear sad farewells.

38:09.227 --> 38:12.104
A wise friend warned me
that your innocence...

38:12.313 --> 38:14.064
...upon which I would have staked my life...

38:14.273 --> 38:16.650
...would fail to meet the test
I set before you.

38:16.859 --> 38:20.362
I called his wisdom cynicism,
but now I know better.

38:20.571 --> 38:21.947
You have killed my love.

38:22.156 --> 38:23.990
You have been false, not to me...

38:24.200 --> 38:26.284
...but to the ideal I had formed of you.

38:26.494 --> 38:30.080
You used to stir my imagination.
Now you are nothing to me.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.375
I will never see you again.
I will never mention your name.

38:33.584 --> 38:37.879
I will never think of you.
Henceforth, I shall live only for pleasure.

38:38.089 --> 38:40.006
Everything else is meaningless.

38:40.216 --> 38:42.884
And if this leads me
to the destruction of my soul...

38:43.094 --> 38:45.554
...then it is only you who are responsible.

38:45.763 --> 38:47.305
Do not try to see me.

38:47.515 --> 38:50.976
I shall leave England
and not return for a long time.

38:51.185 --> 38:53.478
I am sending with this letter
a gift of money...

38:53.688 --> 38:56.773
...which will compensate you
for any disappointment you may feel.

38:56.983 --> 38:59.526
I have been living in a land of illusions.

38:59.735 --> 39:01.945
Now, I shall make an end of dreams.

39:02.738 --> 39:04.656
My real life begins.

39:04.866 --> 39:10.620
My own life, in which you cannot
possibly have any part.

39:25.970 --> 39:28.013
Five minutes, Miss Vane.

39:43.446 --> 39:47.616
In spite of himself,
Dorian was troubled by what he had done.

39:47.825 --> 39:51.077
His uneasy conscience
made him avoid those he knew...

39:51.287 --> 39:54.372
...and all night he had wandered alone
through the dimly lit streets...

39:54.582 --> 39:57.792
...and evil-looking houses
of the London half-world.

39:58.794 --> 40:02.380
When at last he returned to his silent,
shuttered house in Mayfair...

40:02.590 --> 40:07.177
...he could not overcome
a sense of something ominous impending.

40:12.099 --> 40:16.102
His eye fell on the portrait
Basil Hallward had painted of him.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.292
In the dim, shaded light...

40:39.502 --> 40:43.755
...the face appeared to him
to be a little changed.

40:43.965 --> 40:47.425
The expression looked somehow different.

40:48.344 --> 40:51.763
One would have said that there was
a touch of cruelty in the mouth.

40:53.808 --> 40:55.684
It was very strange.

41:15.955 --> 41:19.583
There was no doubt
that the whole expression had altered.

41:21.335 --> 41:25.422
The lines of cruelty about the mouth
were unmistakable.

41:40.980 --> 41:43.857
There was no such expression on his face.

41:48.029 --> 41:52.073
If only the picture could change,
and I could be always as I am now.

41:52.283 --> 41:54.242
For that I would give everything.

41:54.452 --> 41:57.746
Yes, there is nothing in the whole world
I would not give.

41:57.955 --> 42:00.290
I would give my soul for that.

42:02.460 --> 42:05.545
But, surely, his wish had not been fulfilled.

42:06.505 --> 42:11.051
Such things were impossible.
It was monstrous even to think of it.

42:14.096 --> 42:17.515
What if someone else observed
the horrible change, his valet, perhaps?

42:17.725 --> 42:21.853
What if Basil Hallward came
and asked to look at his own picture?

42:30.279 --> 42:33.531
But he was being ridiculous.
This was a mere hallucination.

42:33.741 --> 42:36.826
An illusion brought on by his troubled senses.

42:37.620 --> 42:41.331
The picture had not changed.
He was mad to think so.

42:41.540 --> 42:44.376
A painted canvas could not alter.

42:46.379 --> 42:49.714
He would look at it again after he had slept,
when he was calmer...

42:49.924 --> 42:53.051
...and he would laugh at this fantastic idea.

42:55.221 --> 42:59.057
But in the afternoon when he returned
to examine the portrait again...

42:59.266 --> 43:01.226
...fantastic as the idea was...

43:01.435 --> 43:05.689
...his memory of that cruel look
was disturbingly vivid.

43:16.659 --> 43:20.870
It was true. The expression had altered.

43:21.872 --> 43:26.459
There was no doubt of it.
It was incredible, and yet it was a fact.

43:28.379 --> 43:32.674
Was this portrait to become for him
the emblem of his own conscience?

43:32.883 --> 43:35.927
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?

43:37.888 --> 43:40.765
But if this painting was to be
his conscience made visible...

43:40.975 --> 43:43.017
...then he would let it instruct him.

43:43.227 --> 43:45.145
He would give it no reason
to reproach him.

43:45.354 --> 43:47.772
He would live purely and nobly.

43:51.068 --> 43:54.154
He had been cruel to Sibyl Vane.
But it was not too late to make that right.

43:54.363 --> 43:56.364
She could still be his wife.

43:56.574 --> 43:58.825
He would marry her.
They could be happy together.

43:59.034 --> 44:02.036
He implored her forgiveness.
He blamed himself.

44:02.246 --> 44:04.956
He gave way to the luxury of self-reproach.

44:06.625 --> 44:09.961
When he finished the letter,
he felt that he had been forgiven.

44:13.132 --> 44:15.842
Dorian, let me in. I must see you.

44:19.263 --> 44:21.973
Open the door, Dorian.
I'll not go away until I see you.

44:30.316 --> 44:32.650
Dorian, let me in.

44:37.364 --> 44:41.493
You shouldn't lock yourself in like this, Dorian.
I'm sorry for it all, dreadfully sorry.

44:41.702 --> 44:44.162
- You mean about Sibyl Vane?
- Yes, of course.

44:44.371 --> 44:46.247
It's all right now.
I'm actually grateful to you.

44:46.457 --> 44:47.916
I've learned to know myself better.

44:48.125 --> 44:51.503
I know you will sneer at me, but from now on,
I'm going to do as my conscience bids me.

44:51.712 --> 44:55.089
- What on earth are you talking about?
- About Sibyl Vane. I'm going to marry her.

44:55.299 --> 44:57.759
- Marry her?
- I know what you're going to say.

44:57.968 --> 45:00.303
Something cynical about marriage.
Don't say it.

45:00.513 --> 45:04.349
Two weeks ago, I asked Sibyl to marry me.
I'm not going to break my word to her.

45:04.558 --> 45:06.643
- Then you don't know.
- Know what?

45:06.852 --> 45:09.979
- Haven't you read the morning papers?
- No, I haven't.

45:17.071 --> 45:19.322
What is it, Harry? What's happened?

45:25.913 --> 45:27.747
Sibyl Vane is dead.

45:47.893 --> 45:50.728
That's why I hurried here.
I didn't want you to see anyone until I came.

45:50.938 --> 45:53.523
When I found you'd locked yourself in,
I assumed you knew about it.

45:53.732 --> 45:55.733
There'll be an inquest.
You mustn't get involved.

45:55.943 --> 45:58.736
They don't know your name at the theater,
I suppose, so it's all right.

45:58.946 --> 46:01.155
Did Sibyl?

46:01.782 --> 46:04.659
- Tell me everything, Harry.
- It was obviously not an accident.

46:04.869 --> 46:06.995
Though I suppose
it must be put that way to the public.

46:07.204 --> 46:09.831
Half past 12 or so, she was leaving
the theater with her mother...

46:10.040 --> 46:13.084
...when she said she'd forgotten something
and went back to her dressing room.

46:13.294 --> 46:15.587
She didn't come down again.
They found her on the floor.

46:15.796 --> 46:18.006
She'd swallowed something.
By mistake, they say.

46:18.215 --> 46:20.258
She died instantaneously.

46:21.677 --> 46:24.220
It's tragic,
but you mustn't let yourself brood over it.

46:24.430 --> 46:27.390
You must learn to see it
in its proper perspective.

46:27.600 --> 46:29.934
You must put it out of your mind.
Come and dine with me.

46:30.144 --> 46:32.270
Afterwards, we'll look in at the opera.
Don Giovanni.

46:32.479 --> 46:34.731
Everybody'll be there,
and you can come to my sister's box.

46:35.482 --> 46:37.650
So I have murdered Sibyl Vane...

46:37.860 --> 46:41.905
...as surely as if I'd cut her throat.
- I can't see why you should blame yourself.

46:42.114 --> 46:44.365
I suppose she foolishly
thought she'd lost you.

46:44.575 --> 46:46.492
But no woman destroys herself
who isn't already unbalanced...

46:46.702 --> 46:47.869
Where do you keep your sherry?

46:48.078 --> 46:49.579
If you'd married this girl,
you would've been wretched,

46:49.788 --> 46:51.247
and so in time would
she have been.

46:51.457 --> 46:53.625
I assure you, the whole thing
would have been an absolute failure.

46:53.834 --> 46:56.336
I remember your saying
there's a fatality about good resolutions.

46:56.545 --> 46:57.837
They're always made too late.

46:58.047 --> 47:00.298
- Mine certainly were.
- You should look upon this tragedy...

47:00.507 --> 47:02.634
...as an episode
in the wonderful spectacle of life.

47:02.843 --> 47:06.512
What is it that has really happened?
Someone has killed herself for love of you.

47:06.722 --> 47:08.890
I wish that I'd had such an experience.

47:09.099 --> 47:11.267
The women who have admired me...
There have been some.

47:11.477 --> 47:14.270
- have insisted on living on long after
I have ceased to care for them...

47:14.480 --> 47:17.273
...or they to care for me.
They've become stout and tedious.

47:17.483 --> 47:19.317
When I meet them,
they go in for reminiscences.

47:19.526 --> 47:21.945
That awful memory of woman.
Drink, it'll make you feel better.

47:22.154 --> 47:24.489
I found myself sitting next
to such a woman the other night.

47:24.698 --> 47:26.824
She once proposed to sacrifice
the whole world for me.

47:27.034 --> 47:29.702
Always a dreadful moment.
It fills one with the terror of eternity.

47:29.912 --> 47:32.914
It happened years ago,
but she dragged the whole thing out again...

47:33.123 --> 47:36.834
...and she assured me that I'd spoiled her life.
However, she ate an enormous dinner.

47:37.044 --> 47:41.005
Not one of the women I've known would
have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.

47:41.215 --> 47:43.424
But you haven't told me yet
if you will dine with me.

47:43.634 --> 47:45.176
I don't feel up to it, Harry.

47:45.386 --> 47:47.303
Then perhaps you'll join me later at the opera.

47:47.513 --> 47:50.682
My sister's box number is 27.
It's on the Grand Tier.

47:50.891 --> 47:54.185
You'll see her name on the door.
I hope to see you before half past 9.

47:54.395 --> 47:57.146
I don't want you to miss
de Reszke in the duet.

48:11.620 --> 48:15.164
I'm sorry, Mr. Hallward. Mr. Gray isn't in.
He's gone to the opera.

48:15.374 --> 48:18.543
- To the opera?
- Yes, sir. Is there any message, sir?

48:20.337 --> 48:22.880
No. No, I'll come by in the morning.

48:46.572 --> 48:47.739
But in the morning...

48:47.948 --> 48:50.867
...Dorian no longer wanted
the consolation of his friend...

48:51.076 --> 48:53.036
...nor his reproaches.

48:53.245 --> 48:55.913
His pride and his sense of guilt
prompted him...

48:56.123 --> 48:58.291
...to assume an air of indifference.

49:04.465 --> 49:05.882
Hello, Basil. Sorry to keep you.

49:06.091 --> 49:08.259
- Have you had breakfast?
- Yes, I have, thank you.

49:08.469 --> 49:11.304
I'm famished. You don't mind
if I have a bite while we talk?

49:11.513 --> 49:13.097
Of course not.

49:15.642 --> 49:19.479
You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane
was lying dead in some sordid lodging?

49:19.688 --> 49:23.483
- What is past is past.
- You call yesterday the past?

49:23.692 --> 49:26.569
It's only shallow people
who require years to get rid of an emotion.

49:26.779 --> 49:28.112
A man who is master of himself...

49:28.322 --> 49:30.948
...can end a sorrow as easily
as he can invent a pleasure.

49:31.158 --> 49:32.992
I don't want to be at the mercy
of my emotions.

49:33.202 --> 49:35.119
I want to use them, enjoy them,
and dominate them.

49:35.329 --> 49:38.206
Something has changed you completely,
Dorian.

49:39.291 --> 49:41.250
You look exactly the same.

49:41.460 --> 49:44.087
You talk as if you had no heart,
no pity in you.

49:44.296 --> 49:45.588
You've come too late.

49:45.798 --> 49:48.257
If you had come in yesterday
at a particular moment...

49:48.467 --> 49:51.052
...about half past 5 or a quarter to 6...

49:51.261 --> 49:53.554
...you would've seen how deeply
I was affected.

49:53.764 --> 49:57.141
Even Harry, who brought me the news,
had no idea what I was going through.

49:57.351 --> 50:00.770
I suffered immensely. Then it passed away.

50:01.396 --> 50:04.857
I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can.

50:05.067 --> 50:08.069
This isn't you talking, Dorian.
These are Harry's ideas.

50:08.278 --> 50:09.654
It has nothing to do with Harry.

50:09.863 --> 50:12.573
I suppose Harry didn't give you
that yellow book I saw on your table.

50:12.783 --> 50:14.325
- What's wrong with it?
- Everything.

50:14.535 --> 50:17.745
It's vile, evil, corrupt, decadent. I detest it.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.249
What would you like me to read, Basil?

50:25.462 --> 50:26.963
Since you asked me.

50:28.507 --> 50:30.883
- "The Light of Asia."
- I'm never without it.

50:31.093 --> 50:35.012
- The story of Buddha, isn't it?
- The story of Buddha, a good man.

50:35.222 --> 50:38.349
- Promise me you'll read it, Dorian.
- I promise.

50:42.312 --> 50:45.773
You've done a sketch of Sibyl.
It's charming. May I have it?

50:45.983 --> 50:49.193
Of course. I must go now, Dorian.

50:49.820 --> 50:52.989
I'm relieved to find you in such good spirits,
in spite of what has happened.

50:53.198 --> 50:56.033
Thank you, Basil.
It's good of you to be so concerned.

50:58.036 --> 51:01.205
Before I go, I'd like to look at the painting
I did of you.

51:02.708 --> 51:04.167
There's a screen in front of it.

51:04.376 --> 51:06.377
I thought the room looked different
when I came in.

51:06.587 --> 51:08.421
The light was too strong on the portrait.

51:08.630 --> 51:09.714
Surely not.

51:09.923 --> 51:11.924
It's an admirable place for it.

51:16.221 --> 51:17.346
Wait.

51:17.556 --> 51:19.265
You must not look at it.

51:19.474 --> 51:22.059
Not look at my own work?
You're not serious.

51:22.269 --> 51:24.770
- Why shouldn't I look at it?
- I don't offer any explanation...

51:24.980 --> 51:27.857
...and you're not to ask for any,
but if you try to look at that picture...

51:28.066 --> 51:30.776
...on my word of honor,
I will never speak to you again.

51:30.986 --> 51:34.071
What on earth is the matter with you?
I'm planning to exhibit it next month.

51:34.281 --> 51:36.532
- That's why I wanted to look at it.
- Exhibit it?

51:36.742 --> 51:38.910
But you told me a month ago,
you would never exhibit it.

51:39.119 --> 51:41.370
You told Harry the same thing.

51:41.580 --> 51:44.916
At that time the painting
had a strange fascination for me.

51:45.125 --> 51:47.877
It seemed almost to have a life of its own.

51:48.086 --> 51:51.797
It affected me so much,
I felt I couldn't let it be seen publicly.

51:53.258 --> 51:56.093
Perhaps you've seen
the same mysterious quality in it, Dorian?

51:56.303 --> 51:58.596
Have you noticed something curious
in the painting?

51:58.805 --> 52:03.559
Something that at first did not strike you,
but that revealed itself to you suddenly?

52:04.603 --> 52:07.772
- I see you did.
- I saw something in it.

52:08.440 --> 52:11.275
Something that seemed
to be very curious.

52:11.485 --> 52:13.152
You were right.

52:13.362 --> 52:15.863
There can be something fatal
about a portrait.

52:17.199 --> 52:19.450
I think I understand what you feel about it.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.452
And I respect your wishes.

52:21.662 --> 52:24.455
Perhaps someday
you'll recover from it, as I did.

52:25.082 --> 52:27.708
At any rate, I'll certainly not let it destroy
our friendship.

52:27.918 --> 52:29.460
I'm glad of that.

52:29.670 --> 52:30.920
Goodbye, Dorian.

52:32.381 --> 52:33.798
Goodbye, Basil.

52:39.429 --> 52:42.682
It had been mad of him to allow
the thing to remain, even for an hour...

52:42.891 --> 52:46.018
...in a room to which
any of his friends had access.

52:46.228 --> 52:50.314
Henceforth, he must be on his guard
against everyone.

53:00.575 --> 53:03.494
At the top of the house
was his old schoolroom...

53:03.704 --> 53:05.496
...which had not been used for years.

53:05.706 --> 53:07.915
No one ever entered it.

53:08.125 --> 53:10.918
Nothing was in it
but his old school books and his toys...

53:11.128 --> 53:13.004
...gathering dust and cobwebs.

53:13.213 --> 53:16.173
The picture could be safely hidden away there.

53:16.383 --> 53:19.969
He could lock it up.
He himself would keep the key.

53:21.388 --> 53:24.515
There was no need for the servants
ever to enter the room.

53:47.247 --> 53:51.625
He would have to let Victor go,
and the others.

53:51.835 --> 53:55.171
He must bring new servants into the house.

54:06.016 --> 54:08.225
In this room,
every moment of his childhood...

54:08.435 --> 54:11.270
...and its stainless purity came back to him.

54:12.564 --> 54:15.191
Here among the innocent souvenirs
of his childhood...

54:15.400 --> 54:19.153
...the hideous portrait
would be forever hidden away.

54:21.406 --> 54:25.576
The face painted in the canvas
could grow bestial, sodden and unclean.

54:25.786 --> 54:30.831
No one would ever see it.
No one, except himself.

54:33.794 --> 54:35.211
He was to have eternal youth...

54:35.420 --> 54:38.714
...while the portrait bore
the burden of his shame.

54:42.803 --> 54:46.889
He was caught in an evil destiny.

54:50.811 --> 54:54.397
As the years passed,
the miracle of Dorian's changeless youth...

54:54.606 --> 54:57.483
...caused wonder but rarely suspicion.

54:58.068 --> 55:00.611
Even those who had heard
the most evil things against him...

55:00.821 --> 55:02.947
...the strange rumors about his mode of life...

55:03.156 --> 55:06.242
...which spread through London
and became the chatter of the clubs...

55:06.451 --> 55:09.912
...could not believe anything
to his dishonor when they saw him.

55:10.122 --> 55:11.622
He had always the look of one...

55:11.832 --> 55:15.126
...who had kept himself
unspotted from the world.

55:18.713 --> 55:23.551
But while he fascinated many,
there were not a few who distrusted him.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.512
Curious stories were current about him.

55:26.721 --> 55:28.722
It was rumored
that he had been seen in a low den...

55:28.932 --> 55:31.016
...in the distant parts of Whitechapel.

55:31.226 --> 55:34.103
His extraordinary absences
became notorious...

55:34.312 --> 55:37.314
...and when he reappeared again in society,
men would whisper to each other...

55:37.524 --> 55:42.403
...in corners, or pass him with a sneer,
or look at him with cold, searching eyes.

55:43.113 --> 55:45.114
Some of those
who had been most intimate with him...

55:45.323 --> 55:48.242
...appeared after a time to shun him.

55:49.035 --> 55:51.579
Women who, for his sake,
had set convention at defiance...

55:51.788 --> 55:55.124
...were seen to grow pale
if Dorian Gray entered the room.

55:56.251 --> 55:58.085
He could not endure
to be long out of England...

55:58.295 --> 56:02.256
...or to be separated from the picture,
it was such a part of his life.

56:02.466 --> 56:04.008
He was afraid that during his absence...

56:04.217 --> 56:06.886
...someone might gain access to the room
where it was hidden.

56:08.472 --> 56:10.347
Then, suddenly,
some night he would go down...

56:10.557 --> 56:15.936
...to dreadful places near Bluegate Fields,
and stay there, day after day.

56:56.728 --> 57:00.064
When he had recovered
from these visits to the abyss...

57:00.273 --> 57:05.528
...he would stand in front of the picture,
sometimes loathing it and himself...

57:05.737 --> 57:09.031
...but filled at other times
with that pride of individualism...

57:09.241 --> 57:11.909
...that is half the fascination of evil.

57:12.118 --> 57:14.703
He would examine with minute care
the hideous lines...

57:14.913 --> 57:16.997
...that scarred the wrinkling forehead...

57:17.207 --> 57:19.750
...or crawled around
the heavy sensual mouth...

57:19.960 --> 57:25.422
...wondering which were more horrible,
the signs of sin or the signs of age.

57:27.133 --> 57:30.219
He found reasons to justify his actions.

57:30.428 --> 57:35.766
He told himself that man was a being
with myriad lives and myriad sensations.

57:35.976 --> 57:39.728
To live a simple, sincere, honest life
was hardly to live at all.

57:39.938 --> 57:44.733
Was insincerity such a terrible thing?
Dorian thought not.

57:44.943 --> 57:49.280
It was merely a method by which
we could multiply our personalities.

57:50.490 --> 57:54.410
Yet, there was one person towards whom
he found it difficult to be insincere.

57:54.619 --> 57:58.956
It was Basil Hallward's niece, Gladys,
who had loved him since she was a child.

58:00.125 --> 58:05.170
Goodbye, little yellow bird

58:05.380 --> 58:11.135
I'd rather brave the cold

58:11.886 --> 58:14.972
On a leafless tree

58:15.181 --> 58:18.642
Than a prisoner be

58:18.852 --> 58:24.773
In a cage of gold

58:25.942 --> 58:29.695
I was close by and came in for a moment.
I found this old song in your piano bench.

58:29.904 --> 58:31.488
It's charming.

58:31.698 --> 58:34.116
So is the face
that my uncle sketched on it.

58:34.326 --> 58:37.620
He did do it, didn't he?
I know his style so well.

58:39.623 --> 58:41.915
Did she sing this song?

58:42.125 --> 58:45.377
Who is she? Do tell me about her.

58:46.421 --> 58:50.591
She died many years ago,
when you were only a little girl.

58:52.886 --> 58:55.346
Did you love her very much, Dorian?

58:56.848 --> 58:58.140
Yes.

59:03.730 --> 59:05.981
Goodbye, Dorian.
I'm looking forward to your party tonight.

59:06.191 --> 59:09.151
I'm sure it will be wonderful.
Your parties always are.

59:16.076 --> 59:18.327
I'm not really as lovely as that picture,
am I, darling?

59:18.536 --> 59:19.870
Of course not.

59:21.414 --> 59:24.541
I think I've discovered
why Dorian hasn't proposed to me.

59:24.751 --> 59:26.210
And I've decided what to do about it.

59:26.419 --> 59:28.420
And what have you decided to do about it?

59:28.630 --> 59:31.590
I'm going to ask him
to marry me, tonight, perhaps.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.384
What about David Stone?

59:33.593 --> 59:35.302
You think he'd take you to Dorian's party...

59:35.512 --> 59:37.680
...if he knew your intentions?
- Of course he would.

59:37.889 --> 59:40.849
Nothing petty about David,
but I don't intend to tell him.

59:41.059 --> 59:43.435
- No, don't tell David.
- David, you cad.

59:43.645 --> 59:45.521
I never thought you'd be an eavesdropper.

59:45.730 --> 59:48.315
Don't be alarmed about Dorian Gray.
I'm the one Gladys will marry.

59:48.525 --> 59:50.192
Of course, I have nothing to say about it.

59:50.402 --> 59:53.821
- I wouldn't let you marry that devil.
- I'll not have you say anything against him.

59:54.030 --> 59:56.240
I don't have to.
There are plenty of others to say it.

59:56.449 --> 1:00:00.202
Lies and jealousy. There's no evil in Dorian.
Anybody can see that by looking at him.

1:00:00.412 --> 1:00:01.829
He hasn't asked you yet.

1:00:02.038 --> 1:00:04.581
You heard what I said.
I'm going to ask him myself.

1:00:04.791 --> 1:00:09.253
- In front of all those people, I suppose.
- I'll get him alone. It's a big house.

1:00:09.462 --> 1:00:12.089
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, David.

1:01:00.305 --> 1:01:02.973
What's wrong, Dorian?
Why don't you answer me?

1:01:03.183 --> 1:01:05.851
Is there something else?
Something I don't know about?

1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:07.936
You must have heard the stories
they tell of me.

1:01:08.146 --> 1:01:10.522
- Don't they frighten you?
- I don't believe them.

1:01:10.732 --> 1:01:14.401
- Suppose I were to tell you that they're true.
- I will never believe anything evil of you.

1:01:18.031 --> 1:01:19.823
What do you know of evil?

1:01:21.201 --> 1:01:23.494
I only know there is none in you.

1:01:24.287 --> 1:01:28.290
If you had some great trouble, Dorian,
I would want to share it.

1:01:29.125 --> 1:01:32.002
If I were to marry you,
it would be an incredible wickedness.

1:01:33.755 --> 1:01:36.673
Is that a way of saying you don't love me?

1:01:41.429 --> 1:01:42.846
If you like.

1:02:03.535 --> 1:02:06.453
It's very beautiful, Dorian. Thank you.

1:02:09.582 --> 1:02:11.208
Would you find David for me?

1:02:13.294 --> 1:02:15.003
I must go now.

1:02:37.485 --> 1:02:39.069
I've been exploring your house, Dorian.

1:02:39.279 --> 1:02:41.280
You don't mind, do you?
It's better than a museum.

1:02:41.489 --> 1:02:42.447
I see.

1:02:42.657 --> 1:02:45.909
You must have some priceless possessions
in that room if you keep them locked up.

1:02:46.119 --> 1:02:47.786
May I see them sometime?

1:02:48.580 --> 1:02:50.664
What rare things have you stored away there,
Dorian?

1:02:50.874 --> 1:02:53.041
Skeletons of inquisitive guests.

1:02:53.877 --> 1:02:57.588
- I suspected as much.
- I want to leave now, David.

1:02:57.797 --> 1:03:00.757
- Of course.
- Good night, Dorian.

1:03:00.967 --> 1:03:02.885
- Good night.
- Good night.

1:03:03.094 --> 1:03:04.469
Good night.

1:03:28.661 --> 1:03:31.538
It was the ninth of November,
the eve of his own 38th birthday...

1:03:31.748 --> 1:03:34.291
...as Dorian often remembered afterwards.

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:37.085
He was walking home about 11:00
from Lord Henry's...

1:03:37.295 --> 1:03:39.296
...where he had been dining.

1:03:39.505 --> 1:03:41.715
A strange sense of fear
for which he could not account...

1:03:41.925 --> 1:03:44.593
...came over him
at the sight of Basil Hallward...

1:03:44.802 --> 1:03:48.388
...and prevented him
from making any sign of recognition.

1:03:48.598 --> 1:03:49.848
Dorian.

1:03:51.309 --> 1:03:54.937
I thought it was you or your fur coat,
but I wasn't sure.

1:03:55.146 --> 1:03:56.605
- Didn't you recognize me?
- In this fog?

1:03:56.814 --> 1:03:58.398
I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square.

1:03:58.608 --> 1:04:01.109
My house is somewhere about here,
but I'm not certain of it.

1:04:01.319 --> 1:04:03.654
I've been waiting for you
in your library ever since 9:00.

1:04:03.863 --> 1:04:06.281
Finally, I took pity on your man
and told him to go to bed.

1:04:06.491 --> 1:04:10.118
I'm off to Paris on the midnight train,
and I wanted to see you before I left.

1:04:10.328 --> 1:04:11.787
It's luck running into you like this.

1:04:11.996 --> 1:04:14.581
I haven't seen you in ages.
I suppose you'll be back soon.

1:04:14.791 --> 1:04:16.667
No. I shall be out of England
for several months.

1:04:16.876 --> 1:04:19.294
I'm going to take a studio in Paris
and shut myself up...

1:04:19.504 --> 1:04:21.421
...until I finish a picture I have in my head.

1:04:21.631 --> 1:04:25.175
Gladys is coming over to join me later on.
May I come in for a moment?

1:04:25.385 --> 1:04:26.760
Won't you miss your train?

1:04:26.970 --> 1:04:30.055
It doesn't leave until 12:15,
and it's only just 11.

1:04:30.264 --> 1:04:34.309
I was on my way to the club to look for you.
There won't be any delay about my luggage...

1:04:34.519 --> 1:04:37.980
...as I've sent on my heavy things.
All I have with me is in this bag.

1:04:38.189 --> 1:04:40.148
Come in, or the fog will get into the house.

1:04:43.861 --> 1:04:46.363
I hope you're not going to talk
about anything serious.

1:04:46.572 --> 1:04:49.950
Nothing is serious nowadays.
At least nothing should be.

1:04:50.159 --> 1:04:52.869
What I have to say to you is serious, Dorian.

1:04:53.079 --> 1:04:56.873
Don't frown like that.
You make it so much more difficult for me.

1:04:58.876 --> 1:05:01.169
I hope it's not about myself.

1:05:01.921 --> 1:05:03.422
I'm tired of myself.

1:05:03.631 --> 1:05:07.092
It is about yourself and I must say it to you.

1:05:07.885 --> 1:05:11.013
- I'll only keep you half an hour.
- You sound terrifying, Basil.

1:05:11.222 --> 1:05:13.432
It's for your sake I'm speaking.

1:05:13.641 --> 1:05:16.893
I think you should know the things
that are being said against you in London.

1:05:18.730 --> 1:05:21.773
I don't want to know them.
I love scandals about other people...

1:05:21.983 --> 1:05:26.028
...but scandals about myself
don't interest me. They lack novelty.

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:30.073
You must be interested
in your own reputation.

1:05:31.367 --> 1:05:35.704
Mind you, I don't believe these rumors.
I can't believe them when I see you.

1:05:35.913 --> 1:05:37.581
There aren't any secret vices.

1:05:37.790 --> 1:05:40.667
Such things write themselves
across a man's face.

1:05:40.877 --> 1:05:42.419
You, with your untroubled youth...

1:05:42.628 --> 1:05:45.505
...I find it hard to credit anything
against you.

1:05:45.715 --> 1:05:48.383
When I hear all these hideous things
that people whisper about you...

1:05:48.593 --> 1:05:49.634
...I don't know what to say.

1:05:49.844 --> 1:05:52.804
I absolve you from the necessity
of defending me.

1:05:53.014 --> 1:05:54.931
You can't dismiss these charges so lightly.

1:05:55.141 --> 1:05:58.393
Why does a man like the Duke of Harwick
leave the room of a club when you enter it?

1:05:58.603 --> 1:06:02.064
Not because he knows anything about my life,
but because I know everything about his.

1:06:02.273 --> 1:06:04.483
But why are your friendships
so fatal to people?

1:06:04.692 --> 1:06:07.277
There was that wretched boy
in the Guards who committed suicide.

1:06:07.487 --> 1:06:10.197
What about Adrian Singleton
and Lord Wayne's son?

1:06:10.406 --> 1:06:12.240
What gentleman will be seen
with either of them?

1:06:12.450 --> 1:06:14.576
The boy in the Guards was so in love
with a woman...

1:06:14.786 --> 1:06:17.287
...he felt he couldn't live without her.
Am I to blame for that?

1:06:17.497 --> 1:06:20.874
Wayne's silly son marries a woman
no one will receive. Is that my fault?

1:06:21.084 --> 1:06:23.627
Adrian Singleton writes
his friend's name across a bill.

1:06:23.836 --> 1:06:25.253
Am I his keeper?

1:06:25.463 --> 1:06:29.049
Still, one has a right to judge a man
by the effect he has on his friends.

1:06:29.258 --> 1:06:32.511
Yours seem filled
with an insatiable madness for pleasure.

1:06:33.346 --> 1:06:36.014
And when I think of how fond Gladys is of you.

1:06:37.350 --> 1:06:40.685
- What has Gladys to do with this?
- Nothing, I hope.

1:06:40.895 --> 1:06:43.313
And nothing in the future,
if I can prevent it.

1:06:45.149 --> 1:06:47.818
I'm told things
it seems impossible to doubt.

1:06:48.027 --> 1:06:50.445
Lord Wallace was one
of my greatest friends at Oxford.

1:06:50.655 --> 1:06:54.783
He showed me a letter that his wife had written
when she was dying in her villa at Montone.

1:06:54.992 --> 1:06:58.453
Your name was implicated
in the most terrible confession I ever read.

1:06:58.663 --> 1:07:00.664
I told him it was absurd...

1:07:00.873 --> 1:07:04.626
...that I knew you, and that you were
incapable of anything of the kind.

1:07:04.836 --> 1:07:07.712
"Know." Do I know you?

1:07:07.922 --> 1:07:10.507
Before I could answer that,
I should have to see your soul.

1:07:13.678 --> 1:07:16.429
- To see my soul?
- Yes. To see your soul.

1:07:16.639 --> 1:07:18.473
But only God can do that.

1:07:28.568 --> 1:07:31.153
You shall see it yourself, tonight.

1:07:33.114 --> 1:07:36.867
Why shouldn't you look at it?
It's your own handiwork.

1:07:37.451 --> 1:07:39.536
You can tell the world afterward if you like.

1:07:39.745 --> 1:07:42.914
No one will believe you.
You've chatted enough about corruption.

1:07:43.124 --> 1:07:45.125
Now you'll look at it.

1:07:45.751 --> 1:07:47.669
I'll show you my soul.

1:07:47.879 --> 1:07:50.547
I can make no sense
out of what you're saying, Dorian.

1:07:50.756 --> 1:07:55.510
I only ask you to give me some answer
to the charges that are made against you.

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.305
Tell me they aren't true,
and I'll believe you.

1:07:58.514 --> 1:08:01.683
Come upstairs, Basil.
I keep a diary of my life from day to day.

1:08:01.893 --> 1:08:03.727
It never leaves the room
in which it is written.

1:08:03.936 --> 1:08:05.270
I'll show it to you.

1:08:05.479 --> 1:08:08.773
I don't want to read anything.
All I want is a plain answer to my question.

1:08:08.983 --> 1:08:12.235
You'll find that upstairs.
You won't have to read long.

1:08:47.772 --> 1:08:51.608
You're the one man in the world
who's entitled to know everything about me.

1:08:53.694 --> 1:08:56.696
You've had more to do with my life
than you think.

1:09:05.998 --> 1:09:08.917
You think it's only God who sees the soul.

1:09:45.413 --> 1:09:48.540
In spite of the indescribable
corruption of the portrait...

1:09:48.749 --> 1:09:52.502
...Basil was still able to recognize
his painting of Dorian.

1:10:00.344 --> 1:10:04.973
It was from within apparently
that the foulness and horror came.

1:10:07.601 --> 1:10:12.814
It was as if some moral leprosy
were eating the thing away.

1:10:20.156 --> 1:10:22.240
He could not believe
that he had made this portrait...

1:10:22.450 --> 1:10:25.994
...yet there was his own name,
just as he had painted it.

1:10:48.768 --> 1:10:52.645
But this is monstrous.
It's beyond nature, beyond reason.

1:10:52.855 --> 1:10:55.523
What does it mean?

1:10:55.733 --> 1:10:58.735
On the day you finished this painting,
I made a wish.

1:10:58.944 --> 1:11:00.904
Perhaps you would call it a prayer.

1:11:04.033 --> 1:11:06.034
My wish was granted.

1:11:06.243 --> 1:11:08.745
But you told me
you had destroyed my painting.

1:11:08.954 --> 1:11:14.084
- I was wrong. It has destroyed me.
- It has the eyes of a devil.

1:11:15.044 --> 1:11:17.879
Each of us has heaven and hell in him.

1:11:18.089 --> 1:11:20.757
But if this is true, if this is
what you have done with your life...

1:11:20.966 --> 1:11:24.469
...it is far worse than anything
that's been said of you.

1:11:29.642 --> 1:11:31.976
Do you know how to pray, Dorian?

1:11:39.819 --> 1:11:42.028
What is it we were taught
to say in our boyhood?

1:11:42.238 --> 1:11:44.823
Lead us not into temptation.
Forgive us our sins.

1:11:45.032 --> 1:11:48.451
Wash away our iniquities.
Let us say them together.

1:11:49.036 --> 1:11:52.122
- It's too late, Basil.
- The prayer of your pride was answered.

1:11:52.331 --> 1:11:54.290
The prayer of your repentance
may be answered also.

1:11:57.670 --> 1:12:01.923
Do you think I haven't tried?
I tell you, it's no use.

1:12:02.133 --> 1:12:03.800
Isn't there a verse somewhere?

1:12:04.009 --> 1:12:07.846
Though your sins be as scarlet,
yet I will make them white as snow.

1:12:12.393 --> 1:12:16.479
Only last week, Gladys recalled the day
this painting was finished.

1:12:16.689 --> 1:12:19.858
She remembered putting her initial
under my signature.

1:12:20.067 --> 1:12:22.527
There it is, just as she made it.

1:12:23.654 --> 1:12:25.697
If she could see it now.

1:12:29.243 --> 1:12:31.453
I can still pray, Dorian, if you can't.

1:12:34.248 --> 1:12:36.458
Gladys must never know.

1:12:36.667 --> 1:12:40.712
Yet sometime, somehow,
Basil might reveal his secret to her.

1:12:40.921 --> 1:12:44.966
The one person in the world
whose good opinion was indispensable to him.

1:12:49.472 --> 1:12:52.640
An uncontrollable feeling of hatred
for Basil came over him...

1:12:52.850 --> 1:12:55.268
...together with a terror of the knowledge
he had given him...

1:12:55.478 --> 1:12:56.811
...and the use he might make of it.

1:12:57.021 --> 1:13:01.566
Panic seized him. He felt like a hunted animal,
cornered, desperate.

1:14:20.479 --> 1:14:24.315
It was as if the painting had
sweated a dew of blood.

1:14:47.631 --> 1:14:52.719
He felt that he had struck a mortal blow,
not only at his friend but at himself.

1:14:53.679 --> 1:14:55.805
It seemed to him unbearable...

1:14:56.015 --> 1:14:59.809
...that what he had done
could never be undone.

1:15:19.204 --> 1:15:20.913
Basil was dead.

1:15:21.874 --> 1:15:25.335
Men were strangled in England
for what he had done.

1:15:25.544 --> 1:15:28.004
And yet what evidence
was there against him?

1:15:29.089 --> 1:15:33.426
Basil had left the house at 11.
No one had seen him come in again.

1:15:33.636 --> 1:15:37.221
Most of the servants were at Selby.
His valet had gone to bed.

1:15:37.973 --> 1:15:39.015
Paris.

1:15:39.224 --> 1:15:43.978
It was to Paris that Basil had gone
by the midnight train as he had intended.

1:16:30.401 --> 1:16:32.819
I'm sorry to wake you, Francis.
I forgot my latchkey.

1:16:33.028 --> 1:16:33.986
What time is it?

1:16:34.196 --> 1:16:36.739
- Half past 12, sir.
- Half past 12.

1:16:36.949 --> 1:16:39.367
You must wake me at 9 in the morning.
I have some work to do.

1:16:39.576 --> 1:16:40.660
Yes, sir.

1:16:43.622 --> 1:16:45.415
Did anyone call this evening?

1:16:45.624 --> 1:16:49.877
Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed till 11
and then he went to catch his train.

1:16:50.087 --> 1:16:51.421
He said he was leaving for Paris.

1:16:51.630 --> 1:16:53.798
I'm sorry I didn't see him.
Did he leave any message?

1:16:54.007 --> 1:16:57.635
He said he would write you from Paris
if he didn't find you at your club.

1:16:57.845 --> 1:17:01.305
- Thank you, Francis.
- Is there anything more, sir?

1:17:01.515 --> 1:17:04.517
I'm going to write a letter.
I'd like you to deliver it early in the morning.

1:17:04.727 --> 1:17:07.103
Mr. Allen Campbell.
You'll find the address on the envelope.

1:17:07.312 --> 1:17:09.397
Yes, sir. Good night, sir.

1:17:15.112 --> 1:17:18.531
In the morning, when Allen
Campbell received his letter, he would come.

1:17:18.741 --> 1:17:20.366
He would come at once.

1:17:23.746 --> 1:17:28.124
Allen would help him.
He was the only one who could help him now.

1:17:28.333 --> 1:17:31.294
But what if Allen Campbell
should be out of England?

1:17:31.503 --> 1:17:34.422
Days would pass
before he could come back.

1:17:36.341 --> 1:17:38.760
Perhaps he would refuse to come.

1:17:42.723 --> 1:17:44.807
Mr. Allen Campbell, sir.

1:17:46.643 --> 1:17:48.728
This is kind of you, Allen.

1:17:54.943 --> 1:17:57.653
You said it was a matter of life and death.

1:17:57.863 --> 1:17:59.322
Listen to this.

1:18:01.366 --> 1:18:04.118
I sent my Soul through the Invisible

1:18:04.328 --> 1:18:07.079
Some letter of that After-life to spell:

1:18:07.289 --> 1:18:09.540
And by and by my Soul return'd to me

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:15.421
And answer'd "I Myself am Heav'n and Hell:"

1:18:18.342 --> 1:18:19.759
That's quite good, don't you think?

1:18:19.968 --> 1:18:23.012
I didn't come here to discuss
the verses of Omar Khayyam.

1:18:23.222 --> 1:18:26.432
No, of course not. Please sit down, Allen.
I'll tell you why I sent for you.

1:18:31.396 --> 1:18:33.356
Allen, in a locked room
at the top of this house...

1:18:33.565 --> 1:18:36.442
...a room to which no one
but myself has access...

1:18:36.652 --> 1:18:39.320
...a dead man is lying across a table.

1:18:39.530 --> 1:18:41.656
He's been dead for 10 hours.

1:18:41.865 --> 1:18:45.535
Who he is, why he died, how he died,
are matters that do not concern you.

1:18:45.744 --> 1:18:47.954
- What you must do is...
- There's no need for you to go on.

1:18:48.163 --> 1:18:49.831
Your horrible secrets don't interest me.

1:18:54.753 --> 1:18:57.255
They'll have to interest you.

1:18:57.464 --> 1:19:00.007
You are the one man
who is able to save me.

1:19:00.217 --> 1:19:01.384
You are scientific, Allen.

1:19:01.593 --> 1:19:04.971
I have seen your name in scientific reviews
in connection with certain experiments.

1:19:05.180 --> 1:19:06.639
What has that to do with you?

1:19:06.849 --> 1:19:09.851
What you have got to do is to destroy
the thing that is upstairs.

1:19:10.060 --> 1:19:12.228
Destroy it so that not a vestige is left.

1:19:12.437 --> 1:19:16.190
Nobody saw this person come into the house.
He is supposed to be in Paris.

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:19.360
When he is missed,
not a trace of him must be found here.

1:19:19.570 --> 1:19:22.154
You must change him
and everything that belongs to him...

1:19:22.364 --> 1:19:25.575
...including his coat and his traveling bag,
which I have locked up in this room...

1:19:25.784 --> 1:19:27.034
...into a handful of ashes.

1:19:27.244 --> 1:19:31.414
You must be insane to suppose
I'd lift a finger to help you.

1:19:32.291 --> 1:19:35.585
- It was suicide, Allen.
- What drove him to it?

1:19:35.794 --> 1:19:37.169
You won't do this for me?

1:19:37.379 --> 1:19:40.756
How can you ask me, of all men,
to mix myself up in this horror?

1:19:43.135 --> 1:19:47.346
Allen, it was murder. I killed him.

1:19:49.266 --> 1:19:51.100
He was responsible for the ruin of my life.

1:19:51.310 --> 1:19:53.394
He didn't intend it,
but the result was the same.

1:19:53.604 --> 1:19:54.854
You are certain to be caught.

1:19:55.063 --> 1:19:58.357
No man commits a crime
without doing something stupid.

1:19:58.609 --> 1:20:01.777
- I'll have no part of it.
- We were friends once, Allen.

1:20:01.987 --> 1:20:03.237
I regret that.

1:20:03.447 --> 1:20:06.115
Don't you understand
that if you don't help me, I'm lost?

1:20:06.325 --> 1:20:09.493
- They will hang me for what I have done.
- Let them.

1:20:09.703 --> 1:20:12.204
- You refuse?
- Yes.

1:20:12.414 --> 1:20:14.206
- I entreat you.
- It's useless.

1:20:16.293 --> 1:20:19.337
I'm sorry, Allen.
You leave me no alternative.

1:20:19.546 --> 1:20:22.632
I've written a letter. Here it is.

1:20:24.676 --> 1:20:26.552
You see the address.

1:20:26.762 --> 1:20:30.473
If you don't help me, I must send it.
If you don't help me, I will send it.

1:20:30.682 --> 1:20:33.267
You know what the result will be.

1:20:43.153 --> 1:20:44.779
The thing is quite simple, Allen.

1:20:46.323 --> 1:20:48.115
It would kill her.

1:20:49.034 --> 1:20:52.578
I didn't think you would want
her name involved in such a scandal.

1:20:55.415 --> 1:20:57.333
I cannot do it.

1:20:57.542 --> 1:20:58.918
You have no choice.

1:21:04.341 --> 1:21:09.136
I shall have to go home
and get some things from the laboratory.

1:21:13.809 --> 1:21:15.851
You've saved my life.

1:21:26.238 --> 1:21:28.698
Dorian dined that evening
with Lady Narborough...

1:21:28.907 --> 1:21:31.492
...who had what Lord Henry described as...

1:21:31.702 --> 1:21:35.037
...the remains
of a really remarkable ugliness.

1:21:36.623 --> 1:21:37.957
You left early last night, Dorian.

1:21:38.166 --> 1:21:40.668
Did you go straight home,
or did you go to the club?

1:21:40.877 --> 1:21:44.130
Why are you so inquisitive, Harry?
I came in at half past 12.

1:21:44.339 --> 1:21:46.590
If you want any corroborative evidence,
you can ask my man.

1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:49.885
- Remember your promise, Lord Henry.
- There are two hours unaccounted for...

1:21:50.095 --> 1:21:52.930
...I suspect will bear investigation.
Or perhaps they will not.

1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:55.224
You've hardly touched
my beautiful dinner, Lord Henry.

1:21:55.434 --> 1:21:56.434
I believe you're in love.

1:21:56.643 --> 1:21:59.020
I haven't been in love.
Not since Madame de Farrol left.

1:21:59.229 --> 1:22:01.272
- Madame de Farrol?
- She's a wonderful woman.

1:22:01.481 --> 1:22:04.108
When her third husband died,
her hair turned quite gold from grief.

1:22:04.317 --> 1:22:05.735
What's her fourth husband like?

1:22:05.944 --> 1:22:08.237
Husbands of beautiful women belong
to the criminal classes.

1:22:08.447 --> 1:22:10.698
I'm not surprised
that the world says you're wicked.

1:22:10.907 --> 1:22:13.701
What world says that, Lady Narborough?
It can only be the next world.

1:22:13.910 --> 1:22:15.745
This world and Harry are on excellent terms.

1:22:15.954 --> 1:22:17.413
Everyone I know says he's wicked.

1:22:17.622 --> 1:22:19.582
It's monstrous
the way people go about nowadays...

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:23.753
...saying things behind one's back
that are absolutely and entirely true.

1:22:23.962 --> 1:22:25.504
Women love us for our defects.

1:22:25.714 --> 1:22:29.050
If we have enough of them,
they'll forgive us anything, even our intellects.

1:22:29.259 --> 1:22:32.053
At any rate, no one'll ever persuade me
that Mr. Gray is wicked.

1:22:32.262 --> 1:22:34.764
And I shall never forgive him
for remaining a bachelor.

1:22:34.973 --> 1:22:37.224
Don't you think we ought to find
a wife for Mr. Gray?

1:22:37.434 --> 1:22:38.642
I'm always telling him so.

1:22:38.852 --> 1:22:40.728
I shall go through Debrett tonight...

1:22:40.937 --> 1:22:43.439
...and draw out a list
of all the eligible young ladies.

1:22:43.648 --> 1:22:46.400
- With their ages?
- Only slightly edited.

1:22:46.610 --> 1:22:49.862
I want it to be a suitable alliance.
I want you both to be happy.

1:22:50.072 --> 1:22:52.031
I shall save you the trouble of looking.

1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:54.575
I have already chosen her,
if she will have me.

1:22:54.785 --> 1:22:56.952
I don't believe it.

1:22:57.162 --> 1:22:59.455
Gladys, darling. Will you marry me?

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:10.841
Of course I will, darling.

1:23:11.051 --> 1:23:13.135
This is the only marriage
I've ever approved of.

1:23:13.345 --> 1:23:15.137
- How exciting.
- That is a stunner.

1:23:15.347 --> 1:23:17.598
- I'm so happy for you.
- I congratulate you both.

1:23:24.731 --> 1:23:27.650
For months, the mysterious
disappearance of Basil Hallward...

1:23:27.859 --> 1:23:29.902
...was the sensation of London.

1:23:33.532 --> 1:23:35.658
You don't mind if I go on with my work
while we talk?

1:23:35.867 --> 1:23:38.369
- Not at all.
- It's a matter of some urgency.

1:23:38.578 --> 1:23:41.831
- Tell me what you discovered in France.
- We discovered nothing, nothing at all.

1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:44.667
We hunted up everyone
even remotely acquainted with my uncle...

1:23:44.876 --> 1:23:46.669
...but not one had seen him
or heard from him.

1:23:46.878 --> 1:23:49.171
The Paris police don't believe
he ever arrived in France.

1:23:49.381 --> 1:23:52.633
And here, at Scotland Yard, we're equally
convinced he did leave London.

1:23:52.843 --> 1:23:55.594
The man in the gray ulster
who boarded the train at Victoria Station...

1:23:55.804 --> 1:23:57.179
...was undoubtedly Basil Hallward.

1:23:59.516 --> 1:24:01.433
What are we to do now?

1:24:01.643 --> 1:24:05.437
You're both young.
I understand you're engaged to marry.

1:24:05.647 --> 1:24:09.775
Go on with your own lives peacefully.
Believe me, that's the best course.

1:24:09.985 --> 1:24:12.319
I promise you,
Scotland Yard will not forget Basil Hallward.

1:24:12.529 --> 1:24:15.197
I thought it might be good for Gladys
to go away for a while.

1:24:15.407 --> 1:24:16.365
It would be.

1:24:16.575 --> 1:24:18.200
I'm going to Selby tomorrow.

1:24:18.410 --> 1:24:20.911
I've persuaded Gladys to join me
with some friends on Thursday.

1:24:21.121 --> 1:24:24.248
Others are coming for the pheasant shooting.
We'd be delighted if you'd join us.

1:24:24.457 --> 1:24:26.709
Oh, I'm afraid I can't get away.
But I'm glad you're going.

1:24:26.918 --> 1:24:28.335
The diversion will do you good.

1:24:28.545 --> 1:24:30.337
Thank you, Sir Robert.
You've been very kind.

1:24:30.547 --> 1:24:31.797
Not at all.

1:24:35.135 --> 1:24:36.719
Mr. Gray?

1:24:36.928 --> 1:24:39.471
Are you acquainted with a young man
named Allen Campbell?

1:24:40.974 --> 1:24:42.892
Why, yes. At one time we were great friends.

1:24:43.101 --> 1:24:46.312
It's been a long time since I've seen him.
Why do you ask?

1:24:46.521 --> 1:24:49.356
I've just received a very tragic notice.

1:24:49.566 --> 1:24:52.735
This morning,
Allen Campbell died by his own hand.

1:24:53.486 --> 1:24:56.405
- Why on earth should Allen Campbell?
- Why, indeed.

1:24:56.615 --> 1:24:59.408
I thought you might give me a clue.
He had everything to live for.

1:24:59.618 --> 1:25:02.536
He was just beginning to achieve
a name for himself in science.

1:25:02.746 --> 1:25:05.915
He left no note or letter,
no explanation of any sort?

1:25:06.124 --> 1:25:09.752
None. Whatever drove him to it,
he took the secret with him.

1:25:09.961 --> 1:25:13.088
How little we really know
of what goes on inside a man.

1:25:16.301 --> 1:25:17.593
Yes.

1:25:22.390 --> 1:25:25.684
You've been sad all evening.
Is it Allen Campbell?

1:25:26.436 --> 1:25:28.812
- Perhaps.
- I'm sorry.

1:25:36.279 --> 1:25:38.072
Let's be married soon, in a fortnight.

1:25:38.281 --> 1:25:41.033
A simple wedding
with only our closest friends.

1:25:41.243 --> 1:25:43.410
A fortnight? You call that soon?

1:25:55.507 --> 1:25:56.632
Good night, darling.

1:25:56.841 --> 1:25:59.093
I'll come to Selby
on Thursday afternoon with Janet.

1:25:59.302 --> 1:26:01.178
I'll be at the station.

1:26:10.814 --> 1:26:13.107
Allen Campbell.

1:26:13.316 --> 1:26:16.485
Would Allen's blood
be on the painting now?

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:22.366
There were other roads to forgetfulness
than the one that Allen took.

1:26:22.575 --> 1:26:24.827
- Where to, sir?
- Bluegate Fields.

1:26:27.205 --> 1:26:28.747
Yes, sir.

1:26:30.417 --> 1:26:34.169
One day we shall be awakened
with suffering and dismay...

1:26:34.379 --> 1:26:38.132
...to the realization
that the soul is not a superstition.

1:26:38.341 --> 1:26:44.179
Nor the spirit of man, a material substance
that can be viewed under a microscope.

1:26:45.140 --> 1:26:49.018
The eternal words are as true today
as when he uttered them.

1:26:49.853 --> 1:26:53.939
What shall it profit a man
if he gain the whole world...

1:26:54.149 --> 1:26:56.525
...and lose his soul?

1:26:56.735 --> 1:26:58.986
The soul is not an illusion.

1:26:59.195 --> 1:27:01.572
It is a terrible reality.

1:27:01.781 --> 1:27:04.950
It can be bought and sold
and bartered away.

1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:07.703
It can be poisoned or made perfect.

1:27:08.705 --> 1:27:14.043
That man, rich or poor, who has the light
of faith and charity within himself...

1:27:14.252 --> 1:27:17.504
...even though he were plunged
into the very pit of darkness...

1:27:18.256 --> 1:27:21.884
...would still enjoy the clear light of day.

1:27:23.053 --> 1:27:26.889
But the wretched creature
whose soul is filled with dark thoughts...

1:27:27.098 --> 1:27:30.142
...and foul deeds must dwell in darkness.

1:27:30.352 --> 1:27:33.520
Even though he walk
under the noonday sun...

1:27:33.730 --> 1:27:36.940
...he must carry his own vile
dungeon round with him.

1:28:54.602 --> 1:28:56.770
What's that you're playing?

1:28:57.689 --> 1:28:59.314
It has a name, hasn't it?

1:29:00.859 --> 1:29:03.485
A kind of name.

1:29:03.695 --> 1:29:06.488
It's called "Prelude."

1:29:07.824 --> 1:29:09.324
Play something else.

1:29:22.797 --> 1:29:25.340
Why you do not like that music?

1:29:25.550 --> 1:29:28.635
I heard someone play that piece before.

1:29:33.224 --> 1:29:36.018
- Eighteen years ago.
- A woman?

1:29:38.813 --> 1:29:42.024
Every time I get back to London,
I look for him.

1:29:42.734 --> 1:29:46.820
"Sir Tristan," my sister called him.
Because he was like a knight.

1:29:48.072 --> 1:29:51.700
If he was in Rangoon or Valparaiso,
I'd find him.

1:29:51.910 --> 1:29:55.537
But in London,
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

1:29:56.706 --> 1:29:58.707
I don't know his real name.

1:30:00.043 --> 1:30:02.127
I don't even know what he looks like.

1:30:02.337 --> 1:30:04.213
And when you find him,
what will you do?

1:30:10.220 --> 1:30:13.472
Maybe he's dead already.
Did you think of that?

1:30:22.398 --> 1:30:24.316
I'll keep on looking.

1:30:27.862 --> 1:30:29.863
You're not English.

1:30:30.615 --> 1:30:32.533
What is English?

1:30:33.326 --> 1:30:37.412
There are men and there are women.

1:30:40.333 --> 1:30:42.918
This is Sir Tristan, Kate darling.

1:30:43.127 --> 1:30:45.170
I've asked you not to call me that, Adrian.

1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:49.424
I heard Lord Henry call you Sir Tristan,
and at the time I thought it fit.

1:30:50.969 --> 1:30:54.763
- Why do we never see you?
- I have all I need here.

1:30:55.807 --> 1:30:59.560
Drink and drugs and no friends.

1:31:00.937 --> 1:31:03.063
I've had too many friends.

1:31:04.691 --> 1:31:08.694
Oh, he's drawing a picture of you, sir.
Come and look at it.

1:31:09.529 --> 1:31:14.324
What would you like?
A song, a poem, a painting?

1:31:17.161 --> 1:31:19.788
I do all three surpassingly well.

1:31:23.418 --> 1:31:25.961
It seems to me there's something lacking.

1:31:33.511 --> 1:31:34.803
I have it.

1:31:37.265 --> 1:31:39.558
But grim to see

1:31:44.981 --> 1:31:46.857
Is the gallows-tree

1:31:47.859 --> 1:31:49.610
Goodbye, Adrian.

1:31:51.696 --> 1:31:56.325
And, green or dry, a man must die
Before it bears its fruit!

1:31:56.534 --> 1:31:57.909
Goodbye, Sir Tristan.

1:32:06.085 --> 1:32:07.669
What did you call him?

1:32:10.131 --> 1:32:11.548
Sit down.

1:32:11.758 --> 1:32:14.885
I'll draw your picture
for the price of three drinks.

1:32:15.928 --> 1:32:18.597
- Four drinks.
- Sir Tristan, you said.

1:32:18.806 --> 1:32:23.393
And Sir Tristan rode forth into the forest,
seeking his only love.

1:32:25.313 --> 1:32:27.230
He has gone to kill your friend.

1:32:29.484 --> 1:32:32.027
Justice has come to England...

1:32:33.655 --> 1:32:36.073
...without wig or gown.

1:32:36.741 --> 1:32:38.367
Come on, Kate.

1:32:41.204 --> 1:32:43.455
- If it's money you want...
- I'm Sibyl Vane's brother.

1:32:43.665 --> 1:32:45.707
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No, nothing.

1:32:45.917 --> 1:32:48.043
Why are you called Sir Tristan?

1:32:48.252 --> 1:32:49.461
It happens to be my name.

1:32:49.671 --> 1:32:53.131
You're lying.
Eighteen years I've been looking for you.

1:32:53.341 --> 1:32:55.258
How old do you think I am?

1:33:17.365 --> 1:33:20.575
Why didn't you murder him?
They could only have hanged you for it.

1:33:20.785 --> 1:33:24.371
He's not the man I'm looking for.
He's too young.

1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:27.624
- How old do you think he is?
- Twenty-two, I'd say.

1:33:29.752 --> 1:33:31.753
What are you laughing at?

1:33:32.797 --> 1:33:36.591
Dorian Gray has looked 22
for the last 20 years.

1:33:40.138 --> 1:33:42.097
What did you say his name was?

1:34:13.713 --> 1:34:16.882
When a man says he's exhausted life,
you may be sure that life has exhausted him.

1:34:17.091 --> 1:34:19.092
But in your case,
this strange impulse to be good...

1:34:19.302 --> 1:34:21.052
...is the effect
of your approaching marriage.

1:34:21.262 --> 1:34:23.972
It will wear off in time.
Do you mind pulling down that blind?

1:34:24.182 --> 1:34:27.809
Not at all. The truth is I want to be better.
I'm determined to be better.

1:34:28.019 --> 1:34:30.645
At least it will be a novel sensation,
and needn't become a habit.

1:34:30.855 --> 1:34:34.608
Marriage itself is merely a habit,
a very bad habit.

1:34:35.318 --> 1:34:37.569
I trust it won't make you
a hopelessly reformed character.

1:34:37.779 --> 1:34:40.739
Harry, I've been away so long.
What are people talking about in London?

1:34:40.948 --> 1:34:42.699
They were talking
about Basil's disappearance.

1:34:42.909 --> 1:34:45.827
But now they are completely taken up
with Allen Campbell's suicide.

1:34:46.037 --> 1:34:48.497
- What do you think happened to Basil?
- I haven't the slightest.

1:34:48.706 --> 1:34:51.833
I suppose in a fortnight, we shall be told
that he's been seen in San Francisco.

1:34:52.043 --> 1:34:54.961
Everyone who disappears is said
to be seen in San Francisco.

1:34:55.171 --> 1:34:58.131
It must be a delightful city
and possess the attractions of the next world.

1:34:58.341 --> 1:35:00.675
He was a fine painter. I'm certain of that.

1:35:00.885 --> 1:35:03.637
The best thing that Basil ever did
was that wonderful portrait of you.

1:35:03.846 --> 1:35:06.473
I remember you told me it was stolen
or destroyed or something.

1:35:06.682 --> 1:35:07.641
What is your secret?

1:35:07.850 --> 1:35:10.560
You don't look a day older than you did
when that portrait was painted.

1:35:10.770 --> 1:35:12.646
Perhaps I'll tell you some day.

1:35:12.855 --> 1:35:14.898
To get back my youth,
I'd do anything in the world...

1:35:15.107 --> 1:35:17.818
...except get up early,
take exercise or be respectable.

1:35:18.778 --> 1:35:22.823
I sometimes think I'd give anything if I could
change and grow old like other people.

1:35:48.182 --> 1:35:50.892
My good resolutions
may have come too late.

1:35:52.061 --> 1:35:55.188
Though Dorian placed guards
about the estate...

1:35:55.398 --> 1:35:58.525
...the consciousness of being hunted,
snared, tracked down...

1:35:58.734 --> 1:36:01.069
...began to dominate him.

1:36:01.279 --> 1:36:02.654
In the small hours of the night...

1:36:02.864 --> 1:36:06.241
...when every sound is seized upon
by the distraught imagination...

1:36:06.450 --> 1:36:09.411
...remorse and terror laid hold of him.

1:36:10.288 --> 1:36:15.208
Each detail of his crimes came back to him
in nightmares with added horror...

1:36:15.418 --> 1:36:19.421
...haunting him relentlessly
with the living death of his soul.

1:36:23.134 --> 1:36:29.264
With the day came the cruel necessity
to dissemble to Gladys and to his guests.

1:36:35.605 --> 1:36:37.564
- Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?
- Not very good.

1:36:37.773 --> 1:36:39.649
I think most of the birds
have gone to the open.

1:36:39.859 --> 1:36:42.360
It may be better after lunch,
when we get to new ground.

1:36:47.575 --> 1:36:49.951
- Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.
- Nonsense!

1:36:52.830 --> 1:36:54.623
Good heavens, I've hit a beater.

1:36:54.832 --> 1:36:56.833
What an idiot the man was
to get in front of the gun.

1:36:57.043 --> 1:36:58.960
Stop shooting there. A man's hurt.

1:36:59.170 --> 1:37:00.795
Where sir? Where is he?

1:37:01.005 --> 1:37:04.049
Here. Why on earth
don't you keep your men back?

1:37:04.258 --> 1:37:06.134
Spoiled my shooting for the day.

1:37:19.523 --> 1:37:22.067
The shooting's stopped for today.
It wouldn't look well to go on.

1:37:22.276 --> 1:37:23.485
- Is the man?
- Yes, he's dead.

1:37:23.694 --> 1:37:25.862
He received a full charge in his chest.

1:37:30.284 --> 1:37:31.284
Thornton, come in.

1:37:31.494 --> 1:37:34.037
I suppose you've come about
the unfortunate accident this morning.

1:37:34.246 --> 1:37:37.916
Was he married? Did he have any dependents?
I'll write them any sum you think necessary.

1:37:38.125 --> 1:37:41.252
We don't know who he is, sir.
That's why I took the liberty of coming to you.

1:37:41.462 --> 1:37:43.838
- Wasn't he one of your men?
- No, sir. Never saw him before.

1:37:44.048 --> 1:37:45.799
Seems like a sailor.

1:37:46.842 --> 1:37:49.511
- A sailor.
- Looks as if he'd been a sort of sailor.

1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:52.347
Tattooed on both arms
and that kind of thing.

1:37:52.556 --> 1:37:55.058
Wasn't anything found on him?
Anything that would tell his name?

1:37:55.309 --> 1:37:57.310
Some money, not much, and a six-shooter.

1:37:57.520 --> 1:37:58.770
No name of any kind.

1:37:58.980 --> 1:38:03.441
Decent-looking man, sir. But rough-like.
A sort of sailor, we think.

1:38:03.651 --> 1:38:06.778
- Where is the body?
- In an empty stable at the home farm, sir.

1:38:17.081 --> 1:38:18.707
Show me his face.

1:38:41.897 --> 1:38:43.314
Come in.

1:38:45.151 --> 1:38:47.110
What is it, Dorian?

1:38:47.319 --> 1:38:50.071
Oh, but you haven't changed.
You'll be late for dinner.

1:38:52.950 --> 1:38:54.784
I wanted to look at you.

1:38:57.329 --> 1:39:00.749
I know, darling.
I've felt that way so often about you.

1:39:10.885 --> 1:39:14.846
- Goodbye, Gladys.
- Goodbye? Until half past 8.

1:39:17.683 --> 1:39:19.267
Until half past 8.

1:39:39.789 --> 1:39:40.747
Go on.

1:39:45.002 --> 1:39:47.712
- Shall I go on, sir?
- Yes.

1:39:50.007 --> 1:39:51.341
Dorian.

1:39:52.718 --> 1:39:54.094
Dorian!

1:40:11.278 --> 1:40:14.823
David. What brings you to Selby?
Have you seen Dorian?

1:40:15.908 --> 1:40:17.700
Well, what is it? What's happened?

1:40:17.910 --> 1:40:19.828
Dorian's gone to London. Didn't you know?

1:40:20.037 --> 1:40:21.746
David passed him on his way
from the station.

1:40:21.956 --> 1:40:24.332
- It's strange, his rushing away.
- He looked black as thunder.

1:40:24.542 --> 1:40:26.292
I thought he'd found out
what I've been up to.

1:40:26.502 --> 1:40:28.211
What have you been up to, David?

1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:32.674
You'll put it down to jealousy.
I don't deny jealousy's mixed up in it.

1:40:32.883 --> 1:40:34.425
I had a dreadful presentiment about you.

1:40:34.635 --> 1:40:36.761
And when you announced
the date of your marriage, I...

1:40:36.971 --> 1:40:39.389
I grew desperate.
I wanted to do anything to try and stop it.

1:40:39.598 --> 1:40:41.516
What is it you've done, David?

1:40:42.601 --> 1:40:44.602
There is a locked room
at the top of Dorian's house.

1:40:44.812 --> 1:40:46.354
I didn't think
it was important at first.

1:40:46.564 --> 1:40:48.815
He could have locked up anything
he wanted to keep safe...

1:40:49.024 --> 1:40:50.358
...from the servants even.

1:40:50.568 --> 1:40:53.528
But then one of Dorian's valets came
to see me about a position.

1:40:53.737 --> 1:40:56.197
It struck me how often Dorian
changed his servants.

1:40:56.407 --> 1:41:00.201
This one told me that Dorian would go
into that room at all hours and lock himself in.

1:41:00.411 --> 1:41:04.205
One night he heard a noise and went
to investigate. It was 4:00 in the morning.

1:41:04.415 --> 1:41:07.167
Dorian came out of the room
and looked at him in the strangest way.

1:41:07.376 --> 1:41:09.252
As if he could kill him, he said.

1:41:09.461 --> 1:41:12.005
Then he accused him of spying
and sacked him.

1:41:12.214 --> 1:41:14.215
I began to feel that if I could get
into that room...

1:41:14.425 --> 1:41:17.302
...I might find something
that would put a stop to this marriage.

1:41:17.511 --> 1:41:18.636
And did you get in?

1:41:26.103 --> 1:41:29.272
I bribed one of his servants to get me
an impression of the lock.

1:41:29.481 --> 1:41:31.107
Here's the key.

1:41:32.818 --> 1:41:36.487
I waited until Dorian came down here
to Selby and then I let myself in.

1:41:37.615 --> 1:41:40.909
I know you'll despise me for stooping
to such measures, but I'm not important.

1:41:41.118 --> 1:41:43.870
It doesn't matter what happens to me
or even what you think of me...

1:41:44.079 --> 1:41:47.040
...if I can stop you from marrying him.
- What did you find in the room?

1:41:48.459 --> 1:41:50.919
Nothing to help me, really.
It's just an old schoolroom.

1:41:51.128 --> 1:41:53.087
And there's a huge portrait
with a covering over it.

1:41:53.297 --> 1:41:56.341
- A portrait? Of whom?
- I don't know.

1:41:57.259 --> 1:42:00.470
The original must be a monstrous person,
if an original exists.

1:42:00.679 --> 1:42:04.766
It has a vague family resemblance to Dorian.
A sort of middle-aged, mad, gruesome uncle...

1:42:04.975 --> 1:42:07.560
...with a debauched face
and blood all over him.

1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:10.438
It was painted by your uncle.

1:42:10.648 --> 1:42:13.942
- My uncle never painted such a picture.
- He signed it.

1:42:16.237 --> 1:42:18.112
I'd been counting so much
on finding something...

1:42:18.322 --> 1:42:20.448
...that I decided it was just jealousy
on my part...

1:42:20.658 --> 1:42:23.201
...and I'd been doing Dorian a great injustice.

1:42:23.410 --> 1:42:27.038
I had an impulse to come down here
and make a clean breast of it to both of you.

1:42:27.248 --> 1:42:29.374
Give you my blessing
and ask your forgiveness.

1:42:29.583 --> 1:42:31.751
Can you describe the portrait
in greater detail?

1:42:33.170 --> 1:42:36.256
There's a curious cat in it.
Like the one in Dorian's drawing room.

1:42:36.465 --> 1:42:40.885
Only in the portrait the eyes shine
in an evil way that's indescribable.

1:42:47.726 --> 1:42:51.062
Did you notice anything unusual
about the signature?

1:42:51.272 --> 1:42:52.772
No, I don't think so.

1:42:55.567 --> 1:42:57.819
Now that I see you, Gladys.
I can't say what I intended to.

1:42:58.028 --> 1:42:59.529
I'd be lying if I did.

1:42:59.738 --> 1:43:02.073
I know this marriage is wrong.
You can't go through with it.

1:43:02.283 --> 1:43:04.409
There's something strange
and evil in Dorian.

1:43:04.618 --> 1:43:08.246
Was there a letter G under the signature
on that painting, David?

1:43:08.455 --> 1:43:09.872
Like this?

1:43:11.375 --> 1:43:14.002
I believe there was. How did you know?

1:43:19.550 --> 1:43:22.302
- Yes, Gibson?
- I beg your pardon, miss.

1:43:22.511 --> 1:43:25.805
But Mr. Gray asked me to bring you
this letter when I got back from the station.

1:43:26.015 --> 1:43:29.142
- He said I must give it to you in person.
- Thank you.

1:43:43.949 --> 1:43:46.117
Once I said that if I were to marry you...

1:43:46.327 --> 1:43:48.286
...it would be an incredible wickedness.

1:43:48.495 --> 1:43:51.497
You thought it was a way of saying
that I didn't love you.

1:43:51.707 --> 1:43:55.668
You must know that I do love you,
more than anything in the world.

1:43:55.878 --> 1:43:58.796
But I can only bring disaster
on those who love me.

1:43:59.006 --> 1:44:03.718
If you knew how I've already wronged you,
you would turn from me in horror.

1:44:03.927 --> 1:44:05.845
You will never see me again.

1:44:06.055 --> 1:44:10.141
Try to remember me, dear Gladys,
without bitterness.

1:44:10.809 --> 1:44:14.812
This is the only good thing
I have ever done.

1:44:16.857 --> 1:44:20.151
Won't you tell us what it is, Gladys?
Perhaps we can help you.

1:44:24.365 --> 1:44:26.407
We must go to London at once.

1:44:34.083 --> 1:44:36.959
Was it true that one could never change?

1:44:38.128 --> 1:44:40.755
He longed for the unstained purity
of his youth...

1:44:40.964 --> 1:44:43.716
...before he had prayed in a monstrous moment
of pride and passion...

1:44:43.926 --> 1:44:48.429
...that the painting should bear the burden
of the years and of his corruption.

1:44:50.974 --> 1:44:52.558
Sibyl Vane was dead.

1:44:53.268 --> 1:44:56.270
And now her brother would be hidden
in a nameless grave.

1:44:56.480 --> 1:44:58.523
Allen Campbell had shot himself.

1:44:58.732 --> 1:45:00.024
And Basil...

1:45:05.823 --> 1:45:07.657
Nothing could alter that.

1:45:09.368 --> 1:45:12.120
It was of the future that he must think.

1:45:14.164 --> 1:45:16.207
He had spared Gladys.

1:45:16.417 --> 1:45:19.794
Would there be any sign
of his one good deed in the portrait?

1:45:42.818 --> 1:45:48.698
It was there, almost imperceptible,
but surely it was there in the eyes...

1:45:48.907 --> 1:45:51.826
...struggling through the horror
and the loathsomeness.

1:45:52.035 --> 1:45:54.287
There was hope for him, then.

1:45:57.249 --> 1:46:00.668
He would go away, leave England forever,
live obscurely in a distant country...

1:46:00.878 --> 1:46:04.255
...find peace in a life of humility
and self-denial.

1:46:04.465 --> 1:46:07.967
He would expel every sign of evil
from the painted face.

1:46:08.177 --> 1:46:11.304
He would watch
the hideousness fade and change.

1:46:12.473 --> 1:46:16.058
But the painting would always be there
to tempt his weakness.

1:46:17.060 --> 1:46:18.686
Better to destroy it...

1:46:18.896 --> 1:46:21.314
...to grow old inevitably
as all men grow old.

1:46:21.523 --> 1:46:25.443
If he fell into evil ways,
to be punished as all men are punished.

1:46:25.652 --> 1:46:30.948
Better if each sin of his life were
to bring its sure, swift penalty.

1:46:32.326 --> 1:46:36.204
The knife that had killed Basil Hallward
would kill his portrait also...

1:46:36.413 --> 1:46:40.625
...and free him at a stroke
from the evil enchantment of the past.

1:47:02.105 --> 1:47:05.566
But when the knife pierced
the heart of the portrait...

1:47:05.776 --> 1:47:08.236
...an extraordinary thing happened.

1:47:41.186 --> 1:47:44.188
Pray, Father, forgive me.
Pray, Father, forgive me for I have sinned.

1:47:44.398 --> 1:47:46.190
Pray, Father, forgive me for I have sinned.

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:49.318
Through my fault,
through my most grievous faults.

1:48:37.701 --> 1:48:39.785
Heaven forgive me.

1:48:52.341 --> 1:48:54.342
Take Gladys home, David.
