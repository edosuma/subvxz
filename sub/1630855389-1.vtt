Aw, she's still asleep.

03:17.500 --> 03:22.208
Oh, well, I'll just have to eat
all those pancakes myself then.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.583
Tricked you!

03:26.541 --> 03:28.458
Happy birthday, Bunny.

03:29.666 --> 03:31.708
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.583
Mum?

03:41.666 --> 03:42.625
-Mum?
-Hmm?

03:42.708 --> 03:43.875
You're burning them.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.083
Oh, Jesus.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.250
Here you go. Ta-da!

03:52.916 --> 03:56.333
Oh, okay. Here, put that on.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.708
Looking forward to your party?

04:00.208 --> 04:01.750
-Is Daddy coming?
-Yeah.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.958
-And Denise?
-Mmm-hmm.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.500
Toby, your dad, Denise, everyone.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.708
Not everyone.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.375
Not Grandpa.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.500
I miss him.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, I miss him too, Bunny.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.458
-Two dolphins, yes.
-Yeah?

04:31.541 --> 04:33.500
And the blue one I like the most,

04:33.583 --> 04:37.458
'cause he can camouflage in the water,
and he has a beanbag to himself.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.875
Okay, well…

04:38.958 --> 04:41.166
And has only a cushion and a beanbag.

04:53.791 --> 04:54.875
Bye-bye, Mummy!

04:56.166 --> 04:57.125
Bye, sweetheart.

05:02.291 --> 05:03.291
How's work?

05:03.791 --> 05:06.291
Oh, it's okay. It's work.

05:07.625 --> 05:08.625
Ready.

05:08.708 --> 05:09.583
Great.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.750
Okay,
I'm just gonna place the probe.

05:25.875 --> 05:26.708
That's it.

05:31.958 --> 05:33.500
Just looking for the sac

05:34.125 --> 05:37.958
and the fetal pole, and…

05:40.541 --> 05:43.208
That, Jordie, is a little heartbeat.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.833
Oh. Yeah.

05:52.375 --> 05:56.541
No. You better not be doing
what I think you're doing.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.083
Uh, Mia?

06:18.291 --> 06:19.333
Is Joan coming?

06:21.625 --> 06:22.458
What?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.875
To my party, is Joan coming?

06:26.166 --> 06:29.958
Uh, what makes you think
that Joan might be there?

06:32.541 --> 06:33.375
I miss her.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.916
Isn't it a bit hard to miss somebody
if you've never met them?

06:44.208 --> 06:46.708
I miss people I've never met all the time.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.750
Mummy, why's the door up?

07:27.375 --> 07:28.458
I don't know.

07:54.666 --> 07:57.208
Mum, look what I got!

07:59.291 --> 08:01.000
Aren't you cute!

08:08.500 --> 08:10.750
I know, I know, I know, I know.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.375
You're so cute. I love you.

08:13.458 --> 08:17.375
Uh, it's probably just escaped
from someone's backyard.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.083
But she was sitting here, waiting for me.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.125
Um.

08:23.625 --> 08:24.791
Is that from Daddy?

08:26.375 --> 08:29.125
No. He's coming tonight, remember?

08:30.375 --> 08:31.500
Who's it from?

08:32.625 --> 08:33.750
It's for me.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.916
-Another card about Grandpa?
-Yeah.

08:41.958 --> 08:43.625
I'm gonna call her "Rabbit."

08:59.250 --> 09:00.166
They're here!

09:02.791 --> 09:04.541
There's my birthday girl!

09:06.375 --> 09:08.750
-Happy birthday, sweetheart!
-Hi, Daddy!

09:09.750 --> 09:12.416
-Ah, it's pouring a gale out there.
- Come in, come in.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.958
-Does he need something?
-Oh, he's fine.

09:17.041 --> 09:19.625
I just picked him up from his dad's.
He didn't want to leave.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.083
Where's Denise?

09:21.166 --> 09:24.041
Um, she's coming straight from work.
She'll be here soon.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.541
I love you.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.583
I'm gonna have to put posters up.

09:33.375 --> 09:34.708
Or you could let her keep it.

09:39.958 --> 09:41.083
How've you been coping?

09:41.666 --> 09:42.916
Hmm, good.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.250
Yeah?

09:47.750 --> 09:50.666
Well, I saw all the boxes.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.541
What?

09:53.208 --> 09:54.625
The boxes in the garage.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.875
-When I went to check on the kids.
-Hmm.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.291
I hope you'll tell me
if you're ever… not good.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.750
Dinner's ready!

10:26.458 --> 10:28.500
Maybe we should just cut the cake.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.375
I'm so sorry. She's--
She's two minutes away.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.958
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry about this.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.041
How are you guys? How's Denise?

10:38.666 --> 10:39.791
Uh, yeah, good.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.583
Good. Um…

10:44.416 --> 10:45.250
Yeah.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.375
We, uh…

10:49.833 --> 10:51.833
-Hmm?

10:53.375 --> 10:54.875
-What?
-We…

10:55.583 --> 10:59.416
We… are trying for a baby.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.666
I thought Mia was gonna be an only child,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.291
and we agreed upon that.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.083
You agreed.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.458
-Hmm.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.083
- Hello?
- We're in here.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.000
-Hi!
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.041
-Hi!
- Hey.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.250
What did I miss?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.791
Well, apart from dinner, nothing. Just--

11:20.875 --> 11:22.458
-Kids downstairs?
-Yeah.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.583
-Hey.
-Pete was just telling me the good news.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.000
Yeah, right.
I'm thrilled, actually.

11:27.083 --> 11:30.208
It'll be more work,
but the pay is fantastic.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.916
-And, frankly, I was done--
-Oh, no, no. That--

11:33.000 --> 11:35.166
That you guys are trying for a baby.

11:35.833 --> 11:36.750
Oh!

11:42.208 --> 11:43.208
Mia?

11:44.416 --> 11:47.250
Mia? It's okay. I'm coming, honey.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.583
- Mum!
-Mia? You okay?

11:49.666 --> 11:50.666
Toby hit me.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.416
What? Are you all right?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.833
-You-- You don't hit!
-Sarah!

11:55.750 --> 11:58.125
Sweetheart, let's see. Here, let me see.

11:59.541 --> 12:01.416
He's only three, Mia.
He doesn't understand.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.625
-You little shit.
-Jesus, Sarah.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.791
-Hey! Don't hit!
-Sarah!

12:09.875 --> 12:10.708
Sorry.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.375
Is that a birthday cake
I saw in the kitchen?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.208
Why don't we go and have some cake?

12:23.208 --> 12:24.208
Yeah. Yeah.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.250
Come on, darling.

12:35.791 --> 12:36.625
Sorry.

12:37.666 --> 12:38.875
He is a little shit.

14:21.791 --> 14:23.250
Yeah, piss off.

14:25.583 --> 14:27.333
Yeah, go on, fuck off.

14:29.083 --> 14:29.916
Go on.

14:54.833 --> 14:55.666
Ow.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.291
God.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.458
What is that?

16:02.833 --> 16:03.791
I made it.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.500
Mia, you have fur all over you.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.208
-Can you take this off, please?
- Don't!

16:17.750 --> 16:19.000
Oh, well…

16:19.708 --> 16:20.666
Love you, Bunny.

16:36.708 --> 16:39.750
This is Sandy McLennan
from Warrendi Nursing Home.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.625
Dr. Gregory, we'd like to meet with you
to discuss your mother Joan's condition.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.500
In person, if possible.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.333
Can you please get in touch
to arrange a time? Thank you.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.083
Hi. Sorry.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.541
-Sorry.
-Uh, you're welcome to call ahead.

17:33.625 --> 17:34.458
Yes.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.000
Yeah, I was driving. Sorry.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.958
-Um, what-- Uh, where is she?
-She went out to play. She's with Nowa.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.000
Okay, um…

17:45.708 --> 17:46.541
Fuck.

17:50.916 --> 17:51.791
Where's Mia?

17:52.875 --> 17:55.250
Um, she was just here.

17:55.958 --> 17:56.833
Uh-huh?

17:58.541 --> 17:59.416
Mia?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.041
-Hey, Tubby, have you seen Mia?
-No.

18:33.916 --> 18:37.541
You know, you can always tell me
if there's someone bullying you, Mia.

18:41.416 --> 18:44.000
Is there someone bullying you?

18:49.208 --> 18:50.125
Sure?

18:54.291 --> 18:57.375
Why won't you tell me
why you were so upset today, Bunny?

19:02.000 --> 19:02.833
Sweetheart?

19:04.791 --> 19:05.875
I miss her.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.458
Who do you miss?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.000
My mummy.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.208
Oh.

19:21.250 --> 19:25.083
Mia. I'm your mummy. You know that.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.291
I'm right here.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.291
Do you mean Denise?

19:42.916 --> 19:43.750
Uh…

19:44.416 --> 19:47.250
All right, Mia. Hop out.
Gotta get ready for bed.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.833
- Guess who?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.250
Um, can you take that off, please?

20:30.666 --> 20:31.916
Who was on the phone?

20:34.125 --> 20:35.125
Uh…

20:37.166 --> 20:38.000
Nobody.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.666
A ghost.

20:50.000 --> 20:50.833
Yeah, maybe.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.125
Come on, homework.

21:06.208 --> 21:10.250
So we have to put the trunk
in the family tree about here.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.416
Mmm-hmm.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.541
And all the people are the leaves.

21:14.625 --> 21:15.458
Okay.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.208
You know Grandpa?

21:24.666 --> 21:25.500
Hmm?

21:26.000 --> 21:26.958
How he died…

21:28.583 --> 21:29.416
Yeah.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.083
And we went to the funeral.

21:34.125 --> 21:34.958
Mmm-hmm.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.375
Was Joan there?

21:40.833 --> 21:41.666
Uh…

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
No, she wasn't, Bunny.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.166
Why not?

21:50.625 --> 21:51.458
Well…

21:53.708 --> 21:55.958
Uh, she lives very far away.

21:57.458 --> 22:00.500
We need to stick photos in too.
How far away?

22:02.083 --> 22:03.333
Did you say photos?

22:04.625 --> 22:06.875
-Yes.
-Can't we just draw the pictures?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.583
I need photos.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.958
Well, I'm gonna need them back.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.500
Where's Joan?

22:39.708 --> 22:40.583
Um…

22:41.583 --> 22:44.125
-I don't have any photos of her.
-Why not?

22:50.250 --> 22:52.916
I haven't seen her in a long time.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.375
I don't stay in touch with her.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.333
Why not?

23:01.375 --> 23:03.500
Well, that's just the way it is, Bunny.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.000
But I need a photo of Joan.

23:09.375 --> 23:12.958
Maybe Grandpa
had some in his boxes.

23:18.791 --> 23:20.166
Hmm.

23:20.250 --> 23:21.250
He might.

23:23.416 --> 23:24.375
Please.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.791
Um, you know what?

23:31.375 --> 23:33.000
Maybe we can look tomorrow.

23:34.916 --> 23:35.875
But not tonight.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.250
- I've been looking for that.

24:54.666 --> 24:57.000
-Hey!
-That's not for you.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.666
-What are you doing out of bed?
-It's mine. I've been looking for it.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.166
No, it's not. Go back to sleep.

25:46.666 --> 25:49.666
- It was dark and I couldn't wake up.
-I know, Bunny.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.000
It was just a dream.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.750
It was just a bad dream.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.500
Did you take this to bed with you?

26:09.083 --> 26:10.041
Why?

26:11.833 --> 26:12.666
It's me.

26:13.875 --> 26:16.625
Uh, I don't want you taking
things that aren't yours.

26:17.250 --> 26:19.000
But it is mine. It's me.

26:19.583 --> 26:20.458
It's not you.

26:21.666 --> 26:23.333
How do you know it's not me?

26:25.041 --> 26:27.166
Because it was taken before you were born.

26:27.666 --> 26:28.666
Come on, get in.

26:29.750 --> 26:30.625
Go to bed.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.166
All right. All right, good night--

26:43.833 --> 26:44.708
Mia, what--

26:45.791 --> 26:46.666
Hang on.

26:47.791 --> 26:51.083
Sweetheart, you-- Did you hurt yourself?

26:54.666 --> 26:56.541
Did someone at school do this to you?

26:57.958 --> 27:00.500
Is-- Mia, is someone hurting you?

27:06.666 --> 27:07.875
I want to see Joan.

27:09.791 --> 27:10.750
Uh…

27:14.375 --> 27:17.291
Well, Joan's… Joan's not well.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.000
Well, maybe if she sees me,
she'll feel better.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.291
I would feel better.

27:26.166 --> 27:30.250
-No, I don't think so, Bunny.
-I want to see Joan.

27:30.333 --> 27:31.250
Go to sleep.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.333
I want to see Joan.

27:34.416 --> 27:40.041
I want to see Joan!
I want to see Joan!

27:40.125 --> 27:42.458
Why can't I see Joan?

27:42.541 --> 27:49.166
I want to see Joan! I want to see Joan!

28:50.541 --> 28:52.958
Shit. Shit. Oh, my God. Shit.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.583
I didn't see you hit anything.

29:18.916 --> 29:19.875
You sure?

29:21.291 --> 29:24.375
-Why do you need to look for it?
-Because it might be injured.

29:25.583 --> 29:26.458
Then what?

29:30.416 --> 29:31.333
Oh.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.583
Well, it might be suffering.

29:34.375 --> 29:35.583
Will you kill it?

29:44.250 --> 29:47.500
Uh, you sure you didn't see anything?

30:17.666 --> 30:18.833
Are we here?

30:25.000 --> 30:25.833
Are we?

30:28.625 --> 30:30.333
Sweetheart, your nose is bleeding.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.833
Jesus, what? How'd that happen? Here.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.458
Um, okay. Let's go.

30:53.208 --> 30:56.458
I appreciate you coming here.
Your mother talks about you.

30:57.416 --> 31:00.000
You said we needed
to discuss her condition.

31:00.833 --> 31:05.583
Now, Sarah, I understand
that your father hoped temporary care here

31:05.666 --> 31:07.625
would provide Joan with respite.

31:07.708 --> 31:10.291
What Dad did for Joan was his business.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.000
I didn't involve myself.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.041
Oh, I understand that,
and I'm sorry for your loss.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.125
Your dad was a kind man.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.250
I'm afraid
it's my responsibility to tell you

31:20.333 --> 31:23.125
that Joan will require ongoing care.

31:24.291 --> 31:27.125
Uh, I'm sorry.
Is this about increased fees?

31:28.083 --> 31:30.750
Uh, there are additional costs but--

31:30.833 --> 31:33.125
Uh, you… You have my email.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.625
I didn't need to come in for this. Sorry.

31:36.416 --> 31:39.875
I know that you may have
phoned Dad all the time,

31:39.958 --> 31:42.500
but I've been explicit
about limiting necessary contact.

31:42.583 --> 31:45.000
I didn't even know he'd put her here
until he was dying.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.583
I know about your estrangement.

31:49.666 --> 31:53.458
But, Sarah, this is not simply
a matter of administration.

31:55.083 --> 31:57.416
Your mother
has been diagnosed with dementia.

31:59.833 --> 32:00.750
I'm so sorry.

32:03.708 --> 32:04.958
Uh, how bad is it?

32:05.791 --> 32:08.041
She's been forgetting to wash herself.

32:08.541 --> 32:09.666
Forgetting to eat.

32:10.625 --> 32:13.041
She keeps asking for you
in moments of lucidity.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.958
Now, that's a first.

32:19.166 --> 32:21.333
- You excited to meet your grandma?
-Yeah.

32:25.833 --> 32:27.958
She's had
a bit of a rough morning.

32:32.083 --> 32:32.958
Joan…

32:34.958 --> 32:36.125
you remember Sarah?

32:39.666 --> 32:40.500
Your daughter.

32:47.000 --> 32:47.875
Hello.

32:48.875 --> 32:49.958
Uh, Mia…

32:55.916 --> 32:57.041
Alice?

32:58.291 --> 32:59.125
Oh.

33:00.583 --> 33:01.500
Alice.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.208
Joan, this is Mia, Sarah's daughter.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.916
-Mia's your granddaughter.
- Oh!

33:09.000 --> 33:10.958
I'm here now. Don't be sad.

33:11.583 --> 33:16.250
Oh, I've missed you so much.
So much.

33:17.375 --> 33:21.083
Where have you been? Where have you been?

33:21.166 --> 33:22.750
I love you so much.

33:23.708 --> 33:27.291
-You belong to me.
- Joan, calm down. Please, Joan.

33:27.375 --> 33:29.500
-Okay, that's enough.
- Joan, let go.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.041
-Get away from me!
-Don't!

33:31.125 --> 33:32.916
- Joan, come on.
-Joan's had enough.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.916
-Let's leave.
- No, I don't want to!

33:35.000 --> 33:36.875
- Don't leave me!
-I don't want to go!

33:36.958 --> 33:39.583
-Stop, Mia. We're going.
-I don't want to go!

33:39.666 --> 33:41.833
-I want to play with Joan.
-Let go, please.

33:41.916 --> 33:44.083
-Alice!
- I don't want to go!

33:44.166 --> 33:46.000
Calm down. Calm down.

33:46.083 --> 33:48.250
Alice! Alice!

33:48.333 --> 33:50.500
No! I don't want to go!

33:50.583 --> 33:51.500
Alice!

33:51.583 --> 33:53.750
-No! I don't want to.
-Mia.

33:53.833 --> 33:57.750
-Stop! Stop!
-Mia, just let me put your seatbelt on.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.291
-Ow!
- I don't want to!

34:00.375 --> 34:02.708
-Mia, put your legs inside.
-I want to stay with Joan!

34:02.791 --> 34:05.958
-Put your legs in--
-I want to stay with Joan!

34:06.041 --> 34:07.291
Mia, stop it!

34:07.375 --> 34:08.666
-Oh, God.
-Stop.

34:08.750 --> 34:11.208
-Stop it now.
-Stop!

34:12.625 --> 34:14.958
-Stop kicking me.
-No! I want to stay with--

34:17.166 --> 34:18.833
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:19.958 --> 34:22.041
Please, baby.
Bunny, let me see. I'm so sorry.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.791
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.083
Sweetheart…

34:50.791 --> 34:55.083
I know that you
might not understand why Mummy is…

34:58.916 --> 35:01.291
-Mia. Listen, Mia.

35:01.375 --> 35:02.583
Wait. I wanna have a conv--

35:27.041 --> 35:27.958
Sarah?

35:30.375 --> 35:31.208
Sarah?

35:32.458 --> 35:35.375
I said it looks like
you've both been in the wars.

35:35.458 --> 35:38.083
Oh. Oh, oh.

35:38.166 --> 35:39.916
Yeah, it's awful. Yeah.

35:40.958 --> 35:42.000
I didn't mean to.

35:43.166 --> 35:44.041
Obviously.

35:46.666 --> 35:47.750
How are things at home?

35:48.708 --> 35:49.541
Good.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.166
Yeah. I mean, you know, hard,

35:53.625 --> 35:55.875
given the circumstances,
but we're doing okay.

35:57.291 --> 36:01.000
And do you think Mia's coping
with the loss of her grandfather?

36:02.666 --> 36:05.416
Um, what do you mean, "coping"?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.875
Sarah, the school is here to support.

36:13.208 --> 36:16.208
It's clear there's
something troubling Mia. That's all.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.541
Right, well, I--

36:19.625 --> 36:21.875
Yes, I did wonder
whether she's being bullied.

36:23.708 --> 36:26.833
I think it's something
quite different than that.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.041
Sorry, turn it over.

36:44.125 --> 36:47.125
I've been finding these
on the back of her homework.

36:48.833 --> 36:49.916
What? Wha--

36:51.083 --> 36:55.625
Sarah, I think that Mia
is struggling to control her anxiety.

36:58.875 --> 36:59.708
Okay.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.958
Most kids experience anxiety
at some time or another.

37:05.041 --> 37:09.875
You know, things change.
The loss of a loved one is difficult.

37:10.625 --> 37:13.291
But I think that Mia
may need some extra help.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.291
Do you have a good family GP?

37:20.541 --> 37:23.375
Oh, do you mean… professional help?

37:25.791 --> 37:27.500
Look, it can't hurt.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.541
Sweetheart, do you wanna--

37:35.625 --> 37:38.583
Do you wanna talk
about what's been happening lately?

37:41.583 --> 37:43.958
You haven't really been yourself.

37:45.625 --> 37:47.250
I don't think I am myself.

37:51.625 --> 37:52.541
What?

37:54.416 --> 37:56.333
What does-- What does that mean, Mia?

38:00.125 --> 38:00.958
Mia?

38:02.500 --> 38:03.833
Don't call me that.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.708
I want you to call me Alice.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.500
But your name is Mia.

38:23.625 --> 38:24.583
No.

38:25.416 --> 38:26.333
Alice.

38:34.625 --> 38:35.625
I wanna go home.

38:44.916 --> 38:45.750
Mia!

38:47.000 --> 38:47.833
Mia?

38:56.666 --> 38:59.625
Our Dog Knows Words.

39:00.208 --> 39:03.375
-Hmm, that's a pretty clever dog.
-Look.

39:03.916 --> 39:05.833
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

39:17.666 --> 39:20.791
-Bunny, you can't draw in library books.
-I didn't.

39:23.416 --> 39:26.375
Mia, you're not gonna get in trouble
if you just tell the truth.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.833
I didn't do anything.

39:29.375 --> 39:31.166
Stop lying to me.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.000
I'm not lying.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.750
Well, you are,
because you've drawn in a library book.

39:35.833 --> 39:36.708
I haven't.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.583
I don't understand
what's going on with you lately, Mia.

39:41.708 --> 39:43.333
I need to see Joan.

39:43.416 --> 39:44.250
What?

39:47.916 --> 39:49.791
Why do you need to see Joan?

39:50.416 --> 39:52.666
You never even met her till yesterday.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.833
She says she loves me and I belong to her.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.916
You don't belong to her.
You…

40:00.000 --> 40:01.208
You don't even know her.

40:04.791 --> 40:07.875
She's sick, Bunny.
She doesn't know who you are.

40:07.958 --> 40:10.666
She doesn't know who I am.
She doesn't know who anyone is.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.125
She does know who I am.

40:12.208 --> 40:13.916
No, she doesn't, Mia.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.416
-I'm going to see her.
-No, you're not.

40:21.708 --> 40:23.541
Bunny, you are going to sleep.

40:34.125 --> 40:36.125
You're not my real mummy.

40:38.083 --> 40:39.291
I want to go home.

40:48.958 --> 40:50.416
Hi, Sarah.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.416
Uh, hi.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.541
Sorry. Hi, Denise. Um…

40:55.625 --> 40:56.583
Is Pete home?

40:57.208 --> 40:59.708
Uh, no. Uh, no, he's not.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.250
Okay, um, could you
just let him know that I called?

41:03.333 --> 41:04.583
It's, uh… It's about Mia.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.250
Yeah, yeah. Is everything okay?

41:08.250 --> 41:09.666
Yeah, everything's fine.

41:10.541 --> 41:13.791
Just need to run a few things past him.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.166
Yeah. Um…

41:17.041 --> 41:18.125
Yeah, of course. Um…

41:19.416 --> 41:23.125
I mean, I'm… I'm always here,
if you need to talk.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.583
Oh. Um…

41:28.833 --> 41:29.875
Great, thanks.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.416
Okay. Um…

41:35.375 --> 41:38.000
Hey, I'm sorry
about what happened with Toby.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.708
I-- I completely understand
why you lost your temper.

41:41.500 --> 41:45.791
It's been really hard for you
with your father's passing and…

41:50.416 --> 41:54.250
Pete mentioned it might have
brought up all that stuff from before

41:54.333 --> 41:55.333
with your sister.

41:58.166 --> 41:59.166
What do you mean?

42:00.875 --> 42:02.625
God, Sarah, I'm so sorry.

42:03.791 --> 42:06.125
I can't imagine
what it must have been like.

42:11.291 --> 42:12.250
Sarah?

42:13.083 --> 42:15.375
No, Denise. You can't.

43:49.166 --> 43:50.041
Dad.

45:08.375 --> 45:09.375
You're a good…

45:11.666 --> 45:12.791
You're a good girl.

45:16.041 --> 45:19.083
You're a good… You're a good girl.

46:30.083 --> 46:32.833
- Sarah.
- What the fuck did you tell her?

46:32.916 --> 46:34.000
What?

46:34.083 --> 46:36.333
Denise.
"All that stuff from before."

46:36.833 --> 46:39.541
I thought it was important that she know.

46:39.625 --> 46:41.041
For fuck's sake, Pete.

46:41.125 --> 46:43.000
She's a social worker, Sarah.

46:43.083 --> 46:46.458
She understands, you know,
trauma, family stuff.

46:46.541 --> 46:49.458
She understands nothing.
She doesn't need to understand anything.

46:49.541 --> 46:51.750
-It has nothing to do with her.
-Okay. Okay.

46:52.791 --> 46:53.791
I'm sorry.

46:54.625 --> 46:55.541
How's Mia?

46:58.500 --> 46:59.708
She's fine.

46:59.791 --> 47:00.625
Really?

47:01.291 --> 47:04.750
Because the school called me,
and they said they've spoken to you too.

47:05.416 --> 47:06.333
Mmm-hmm.

47:07.375 --> 47:08.708
What's going on?

47:08.791 --> 47:11.875
She-- [sighs] She wanted--
She wanted to see Joan again.

47:11.958 --> 47:13.541
Then take her, Sarah.

47:13.625 --> 47:16.250
-No. Pete, it's--
-Sarah, it'll be all right.

47:17.375 --> 47:20.375
Take Mia, show her the house,
clear it out, and pack it up.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.416
-Put a fucking lid on it.
-No, Pete--

47:24.500 --> 47:27.625
Sarah, let Mia have
a relationship with her grandma.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.458
Can people come back?

48:09.875 --> 48:12.958
-Come back from where?
-From where they go when they die.

48:15.375 --> 48:16.625
Uh, um…

48:19.916 --> 48:21.291
No, Bunny.

48:22.416 --> 48:24.708
Grandpa said
he would come back as a pelican.

48:26.166 --> 48:27.000
Did he?

48:27.875 --> 48:29.208
I don't remember that.

48:30.958 --> 48:34.791
It was our little secret.
He said he wanted to keep an eye on you.

49:26.541 --> 49:27.875
Does Joan live here?

49:31.333 --> 49:32.166
Mum?

49:33.416 --> 49:34.250
No.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.041
No, she used to.

49:37.916 --> 49:40.791
No, this is where
I lived when I was little.

50:36.833 --> 50:37.791
It's open!

50:39.333 --> 50:40.250
How'd you open it?

50:42.041 --> 50:43.250
Under the pot plant.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.541
Okay, well…

50:50.000 --> 50:51.958
Okay, well, wait. Wait, Mia.

50:53.791 --> 50:54.666
Wait.

50:57.041 --> 50:57.875
Hey, wait.

51:38.250 --> 51:40.750
Hey, I'm gonna sleep in here.

51:41.875 --> 51:42.750
What?

51:43.708 --> 51:45.958
No, Mia. No, hang on.

51:47.458 --> 51:48.625
Look, it's me.

51:49.583 --> 51:51.583
No, it's-- That's not you.

51:51.666 --> 51:52.708
Yes, it is.

51:52.791 --> 51:55.250
No, it's not.
Come on, I don't wanna be in here.

51:56.083 --> 51:56.958
Why not?

51:58.625 --> 52:00.583
Uh-- Because I don't! Come on.

52:00.666 --> 52:01.916
But I like it in here.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.500
No, out. Now.

52:04.166 --> 52:05.083
It's my room.

52:05.708 --> 52:06.666
Mia, out.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.250
Come on, out. Get out. I don't want to--

52:10.333 --> 52:12.750
-No.
-I don't want to be in here. Get out.

52:12.833 --> 52:14.750
-No!
-Just-- Come on!

52:19.250 --> 52:21.041
You're a terrible person.

52:52.916 --> 52:54.125
What are you drawing?

52:58.958 --> 52:59.958
It's for Joan.

53:03.000 --> 53:03.833
Oh.

53:05.833 --> 53:06.708
Can't I see?

53:11.500 --> 53:13.041
Can you draw me one after?

53:14.791 --> 53:15.666
Okay.

53:25.708 --> 53:26.958
So, you lived here?

53:27.916 --> 53:29.541
Uh, yeah.

53:30.583 --> 53:32.541
Before Grandpa and I moved to the city.

53:43.375 --> 53:44.708
Why'd you move away?

53:47.791 --> 53:49.291
Um, I don't…

53:51.250 --> 53:52.750
I don't like to talk about it.

53:55.333 --> 53:56.166
Why?

54:01.500 --> 54:03.041
Because it makes me sad.

54:05.833 --> 54:06.666
Why?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.208
I said I don't want to talk about it, Mia.

54:16.250 --> 54:17.791
My name is Alice.

54:21.333 --> 54:22.250
Mia…

54:24.541 --> 54:28.291
Mia, I need you to tell me
if someone has said something to you.

54:29.166 --> 54:32.416
Denise… maybe? Or-- or your dad?

54:37.166 --> 54:38.458
About what?

54:41.375 --> 54:44.583
If someone has said
something to you about Alice.

54:45.791 --> 54:47.666
I am Alice.

54:49.208 --> 54:52.333
Please. [shudders] Mia, this isn't a game.

54:54.083 --> 54:57.333
Tell me if someone has said something
to you that they shouldn't have.

54:57.416 --> 54:59.666
No one tells me anything.

55:08.958 --> 55:09.875
Okay.

55:13.208 --> 55:14.375
I had a sister.

55:17.166 --> 55:19.250
Her name was Alice.

55:25.708 --> 55:26.916
Where is she?

55:30.583 --> 55:31.666
She went missing.

55:33.250 --> 55:34.541
A long time ago.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.125
When she was only seven.

55:40.708 --> 55:41.833
I'm back.

55:41.916 --> 55:43.000
I'm your sister.

55:43.708 --> 55:44.750
I'm seven.

55:46.166 --> 55:47.375
Mia…

55:47.458 --> 55:49.083
-Alice.
-Stop it.

55:51.666 --> 55:52.916
I'm Alice.

55:53.708 --> 55:55.000
Mia, stop it.

55:55.083 --> 55:56.833
I came back. I'm Alice.

55:56.916 --> 55:58.250
Just stop it, Mia.

55:58.333 --> 56:01.041
-It is not fun--
- I'm Alice! I'm Alice! I'm Alice!

56:07.041 --> 56:09.291
Mia! Mia.

56:10.750 --> 56:14.916
Mia, look, I know you don't understand,
but it really hurts Mummy…

56:17.458 --> 56:18.458
Bunny.

56:21.458 --> 56:22.458
Oh, sweetheart.

56:25.458 --> 56:26.583
I'll get you a tissue.

58:05.666 --> 58:07.458
Looking forward
to seeing your grandma?

58:07.541 --> 58:11.458
-Yes.
-Excellent. Up here, your first right.

58:12.958 --> 58:15.250
-Mia. Mia.
-I'll be here if you need me.

58:15.333 --> 58:16.458
- I'm back!
-Thank you.

58:19.875 --> 58:20.791
Oh.

58:22.791 --> 58:23.875
Sarah.

58:25.541 --> 58:28.625
Oh, we were here before,
and you didn't recognize me.

58:32.250 --> 58:33.375
Mia?

58:37.125 --> 58:38.083
Oh.

58:38.833 --> 58:40.583
Thank you for bringing her.

58:41.625 --> 58:42.458
You well?

58:43.750 --> 58:44.750
Yeah, we're okay.

58:45.833 --> 58:46.791
Your father?

58:48.791 --> 58:49.625
Dad's…

58:50.708 --> 58:52.041
Dad's dead. He died.

58:52.875 --> 58:54.166
Oh, yes. I knew that.

58:56.833 --> 58:57.958
Do you remember me?

59:01.000 --> 59:06.666
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a very, very long time.

59:07.333 --> 59:12.166
Albert told me all about you, little Mia.

59:13.250 --> 59:14.083
No.

59:14.625 --> 59:15.458
Alice.

59:16.041 --> 59:17.833
- Uh, Mia.
- You called me Alice.

59:17.916 --> 59:19.583
- Mia, stop it.
-I don't understand.

59:19.666 --> 59:22.333
-My name is Alice. You said--
-We're gonna go. Come on.

59:22.416 --> 59:24.416
-Why don't you remember me?
- Mia, come on.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.416
Ow!

59:25.500 --> 59:27.041
I hate you!

59:29.375 --> 59:31.333
Mia. Mia.

59:33.541 --> 59:34.500
Mia!

59:47.875 --> 59:49.166
It's a long way down.

59:56.708 --> 59:57.958
I wanna show you something.

01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:34.625
Come on.

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:00.916
Can you tell me about her?

01:01:04.416 --> 01:01:05.583
Oh, uh…

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.875
She was very pretty.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.000
She had, uh… dark hair and freckles.

01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:15.208
Like me?

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.916
Yeah, just like you.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.500
What was she like?

01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:28.625
Uh…

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:30.916
We were different.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.791
And we… fought a lot.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.791
Sisters fight a lot.

01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:49.083
She liked animals.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.875
She'd, um… She'd find animals
and bring them home and look after them.

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:01.041
What kind of animals? Rabbit?

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:06.875
No. Dogs. And… found a bird once.

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:15.291
My dad used to catch wild rabbits.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.416
They were pests.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.916
I used to help him check the traps,
but she didn't like that.

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.708
Did she like games?

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:30.208
Yeah.

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:33.083
Chasey?

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.083
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:36.166
Hide-and-seek?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:37.916
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:40.416
No.

01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:46.708
I don't like hide-and-seek.
You don't look for me.

01:02:47.333 --> 01:02:48.416
Mia?

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.875
You don't like me.

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:53.291
You make me hide and hide and hide.

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:55.750
-Mia.
-You make me hide all day.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.625
You don't want to find me. You lock me in.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.041
Stop it, Mia.

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.000
I hate you!

01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:03.458
Mia.

01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.625
Mia!

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:08.666
Mia.

01:03:11.458 --> 01:03:12.625
-Mia.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.375
Go away.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.375
-Mia!

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:39.791
You've called Pete.
I can't take your call at the moment.

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.375
So leave a message.

01:03:41.458 --> 01:03:42.750
Uh, hi, Pete, um…

01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:47.208
I don't know if you or Denise
had said something to Mia,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.791
but she knows about Alice.

01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:58.583
And for whatever fucking reason,
she's pretending to be her.

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:03.458
So if you could call me back, um…

01:04:05.791 --> 01:04:06.791
I don't…

01:04:08.375 --> 01:04:10.583
I don't feel good, Pete.

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:21.041
- Guess who?

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.000
What are you wearing?

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:34.125
It's mine.

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.583
It is mine.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:25.291
Go to sleep.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.583
- Guess who?

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:20.875
I want to sell the house.

01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:24.083
Sarah…

01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:28.458
I'll pay for this place, this facility.
You can stay here.

01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:31.583
-I don't need--
-Dad asked me to before he died.

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:34.458
I know that…

01:09:36.458 --> 01:09:40.583
you still spoke, but I didn't know--
I didn't know all this.

01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:44.291
Oh.
You don't need to sell the house.

01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:47.750
I'm gonna go back there when I leave here.

01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:50.416
It's what your father and I agreed.

01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:53.041
You can't go back there.

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:55.583
But it's her home.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.125
She's not coming back.

01:10:04.375 --> 01:10:05.333
She's not.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:11.000
What do you think's gonna happen?
She'll stroll through the door one day?

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.208
You've wasted your life waiting for her.

01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.458
-You're a nasty little thing.

01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:21.000
I don't want to look at you.
I can't stand the sight of you.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.791
I should never have left her with you.

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.708
-She's not safe with you.
-Ow!

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.250
-She's--
-Get off me!

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:42.083
Mia?

01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:47.416
Mia?

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:07.541
Mia?

01:11:13.541 --> 01:11:14.541
Sweetheart?

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:21.041
Shit.

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:27.666
Mia? Sweetheart?

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:37.166
Mia?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.916
Sweetheart?

01:11:47.708 --> 01:11:48.541
Mia?

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:52.583
Mia?

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:01.416
Mia?

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:09.750
Mia?

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:39.833
Found you.

01:12:46.916 --> 01:12:48.750
You never, ever do that again.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:51.125
-Do you hear me?
-I woke up and you weren't there.

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:54.041
I don't care.
What if something had happened to you?

01:12:54.125 --> 01:12:56.666
And did you--
Did you put the pictures back up?

01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.291
No.

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.458
-Did you go into the shed?
-I didn't do anything.

01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:09.333
Joan is not gonna come back here.

01:13:09.416 --> 01:13:11.250
-So we need to pack everything up.
-No!

01:13:13.416 --> 01:13:16.458
You need to pack your things.
I am taking you home tomorrow.

01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:17.875
This is my home.

01:13:19.916 --> 01:13:20.750
Uh.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:25.791
I'm gonna have a shower. Just stay inside.

01:14:16.166 --> 01:14:17.333
I'm sorry, Bunny.

01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:20.791
I didn't mean to yell.

01:14:56.875 --> 01:14:57.833
Sarah.

01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:26.541
Where's Alice?

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:43.583
Mia?

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:47.000
- Mia?

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:49.000
Mia?

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.333
Mia?

01:15:51.875 --> 01:15:55.083
Mia, what's happening? Mia, it's okay.
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:57.541
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
You're having a nightmare.

01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:59.708
-It's okay. You're having a nightmare.

01:15:59.791 --> 01:16:02.625
Sweetheart, it's just a dream. It's okay.
You're all right.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:05.000
-Hey.

01:16:06.541 --> 01:16:09.500
What's this? What's this? No, no.

01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:10.583
What?

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.041
-What?
-No, you're hurt.

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:15.708
- What?
-Let me see. Let me see.

01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:18.541
-What?
-Just let me see. I just need to--

01:16:18.625 --> 01:16:21.000
-Did you hurt yourself?
-What? Stop it!

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:35.208
-Just hold still. I need to get in here.
-Stop it.

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:36.958
-I need to see what you've done--
-Stop it!

01:16:37.041 --> 01:16:39.083
-No. Mia, I need to--
-Stop. Please, Mummy.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:41.250
-It hurts! Stop!
-Mia, don't. I just--

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:42.458
Stop it. Ow.

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:44.916
Mia, just let me--

01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:51.791
What?

01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:56.541
Mia, I'm sorry.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:52.333
You locked me in!

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:56.291
Alice!

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.666
Alice, don't…

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.166
I can't… Alice…

01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:06.333
Help…

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:17.875
Alice!

01:20:19.041 --> 01:20:20.083
Alice!

01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:21.125
Alice!

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:25.125
Alice, I'm sorry!

01:20:26.166 --> 01:20:27.166
Alice! I didn't…

01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:29.916
Alice!

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:37.500
Alice!

01:20:38.708 --> 01:20:39.625
Alice!

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.333
-Jesus!

01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:45.416
Alice!

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:49.875
Let me in, Alice!

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:51.000
Open the door!

01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:52.208
Let me in!

01:20:52.833 --> 01:20:57.750
Please, let me in, Alice!
Please, let me in, Alice!

01:23:02.458 --> 01:23:04.375
- Sarah?

01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:09.833
Sarah!

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:12.458
Sarah!

01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:14.375
Sarah?

01:23:21.458 --> 01:23:23.500
Oh, God. No!

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:26.916
Sarah!

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:32.083
Jesus, Sarah.
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

01:23:32.166 --> 01:23:33.083
Don't.

01:23:34.708 --> 01:23:35.875
What the fuck's going on?

01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:37.625
- Uh…
-Where's Mia?

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:38.541
She's…

01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:41.416
-She's-- She's in there.
-Mia?

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.916
-In where? Where?
-In there!

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:44.833
Here?

01:23:45.416 --> 01:23:46.250
Mia?

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:50.625
Mia?

01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:54.250
-Mia?
-How did she…

01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.333
- Mia!
- Mia?

01:23:59.166 --> 01:24:00.041
Mia!

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:01.916
-Mia!

01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:05.291
Mia!

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.458
Mia!

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:16.375
Mia?

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:18.666
-It's Dad, Bunny!
-Sweetheart?

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:20.666
Mia!

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:24.500
Mia!

01:24:26.833 --> 01:24:27.708
Mia!

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:30.500
Mia!

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:33.583
Mia!

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:38.666
Mia? Mia!

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:40.708
Sarah!

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:43.666
Mia!

01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:01.916
Sarah!

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.583
Help! Help! Someone help.

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:11.208
Help! Help!

01:25:17.916 --> 01:25:19.541
Oh, God.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.375
Mia!

01:25:25.791 --> 01:25:26.666
Mia!

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.666
-Thank God! Baby.
-Bunny. Bunny, you're…

01:25:33.416 --> 01:25:34.416
Come here!

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.625
Did you find her?

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.166
Yes.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.541
Alice.

01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:12.208
Alice is…

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.541
Alice is dead.

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:27.416
Oh, no.

01:27:28.333 --> 01:27:29.541
I don't think so.

01:27:32.625 --> 01:27:34.333
I don't think she's dead.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:00.250
Sorry, you're not allowed
to be in here.

01:28:01.625 --> 01:28:03.291
Oh, sorry, I'm…

01:28:03.875 --> 01:28:05.041
Are you all right?

01:28:05.708 --> 01:28:07.000
Yeah, fine. Sorry.

01:29:15.208 --> 01:29:16.375
I'm sorry.

01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.541
For the things I did to you.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.583
 What did you do?

01:29:32.583 --> 01:29:33.583
I hurt you.

01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:39.041
 What else?

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:44.666
I told--

01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.833
I told Mum you ran away.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:01.666
Why?

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.208
 Because I…

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:13.125
Because I didn't wanna tell her the truth.

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:20.458
 You're a monster.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:33.000
 I'm a monster.

01:31:59.541 --> 01:32:00.500
Mia?
