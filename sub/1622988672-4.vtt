WEBVTT

00:47.297 --> 00:49.091
Has he opened the box?

00:50.509 --> 00:52.386
You didn't tell me
there were gonna be naked people.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.680
I didn't know. Dave didn't mention it.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.016
Oh, no. Is Dave gonna be naked?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.020
His character is called
"The Unprotected Seeker of Truth,"

01:02.104 --> 01:03.438
so I'm thinking yes.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.147
I cannot see Dave naked.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.567
Sure you can, we're doctors.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.986
I operate on knees.
This is way above my pay gra--

01:09.069 --> 01:10.320
It's Dave.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.405
Abort.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.448
Abort.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.660
Because I know not what is inside.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.744
I'm sorry.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.496
-I'm sorry.
-Pardon me.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.331
-I'm sorry.
-Liar.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.125
-I'm trying.
-Go. Hurry. Hurry.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.459
Walk on your toes.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.220
Oh, my God.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.640
Wow.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.143
It's beautiful.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.145
Gotcha.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.647
I love you.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.692
Oh, I'm sorry. That just--

01:48.775 --> 01:50.652
I don't want you to feel any pressure.

01:50.736 --> 01:54.406
And also, it's weird to say that the night
we saw Dave's penis, so maybe just--

01:54.489 --> 01:55.866
I love you too.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.505
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.966
I meet with parents Thursdays
between 3:00 and 5:00.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.426
Good thing I'm not a parent.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.222
Josh Skinner. Dr. Josh Skinner.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.182
Oh, I know who you are.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.310
You're the one who broke
poor Betsy McDonough's heart,

02:23.393 --> 02:25.395
then crossed the footbridge
with every woman in town

02:25.479 --> 02:27.105
in some pathetic attempt to bag a wife.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.775
And how'd that work out?
Get yourself a good one?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.401
I'm still looking.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.153
Please, don't waste
your time looking here.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.822
I wouldn't cross that bridge
with you for $100.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.075
Actually, I'm looking for a place to stay.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.118
Heard there was a room
to let above the schoolhouse.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.453
You heard wrong.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.331
Now, If you don't mind,
I have more important things to do.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.625
So Mildred Layton got to you too.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.418
Mildred Layton?

02:48.502 --> 02:52.798
She had my girlf--
ex and me kicked out of the inn,

02:52.881 --> 02:55.551
and has everyone else in town
so scared they won't put us up.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.135
That woman is a menace.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.762
You know, she's constantly meddling,

02:58.846 --> 03:01.223
trying to tell me what to teach
in my own classroom.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.560
She took my book on wildflowers
and crossed out all the stamens.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.061
So she's got a problem with you too.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.480
Yeah, that lines up.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.192
So what's her deal?
She controls the whole town?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.653
Pretty much. But she doesn't control me.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.906
I can think of a great way to prove that.

03:23.412 --> 03:27.749
I suppose I could
use a handyman around here.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.669
In exchange for the room.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.005
Oh, yes. Handyman.

03:33.088 --> 03:37.217
Super handy. Hung all the pictures
in my apartment in, like, an hour.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.387
Eyeballed everything.
It's pretty impressive.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.056
You must have felt so virile.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.184
You can start tomorrow morning at 9:00.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.186
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.520
Gotcha.

03:49.938 --> 03:50.939
Thank you.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.078
-Make it 8:00.
-You got it.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.999
Here is what I expect from my nurse:

04:09.082 --> 04:13.879
Hard work, discipline and a willingness
to follow all of my orders to the letter.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.839
Absolutely.

04:16.632 --> 04:21.428
So, Dr. Lopez, have you had many nurses?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.222
I have.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.642
Now I will like to show you my equipment.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.770
This is called an obstetric perforator.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.649
Really? Looks like something you'd use
to eat lobster.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.444
Papa?

04:38.278 --> 04:41.031
I'm sorry, son, I just needed
to grab something.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.283
What did you take?

04:44.660 --> 04:46.578
What is it? Show me.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.709
Papa, that is a surgical lubricant.
What could you possibly want it for?

04:53.460 --> 04:56.630
-It's private.
-Not when it's my lubricant.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.757
Come on. Just let them have it.

04:58.841 --> 05:02.052
And now you have encouraged my new nurse
to question my authority.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.181
Fine. Your mama and I are feeling amorous,

05:06.265 --> 05:08.725
and the last time it really helped, so--

05:08.809 --> 05:11.812
-Papa, there is a lady present.
-Oh, I'm good.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.481
You are too old for the act of love.
It's unseemly.

05:14.565 --> 05:15.816
Put it back this instant.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.906
My apologies. You'll find
I don't appreciate interruptions.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.118
-Doc Lopez, I'm sorry, but--
-Young lady, I told you I cannot help you.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.202
-But I--
-Nancy!

05:27.286 --> 05:30.205
If you are determined to have a child
out of wedlock, that is your concern.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.292
But I will have nothing to do with it.
Now please, leave this office.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.293
Wait, what?

05:36.003 --> 05:37.754
What is wrong with you?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.756
You can't just turn away that girl.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.134
I have every right to choose
whom I will take on as a patient.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.344
But you're the only doctor in town.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.140
Epiphany.

05:48.223 --> 05:53.145
E-P-I-P-H-A-N-Y. Epiphany.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.563
Well done, Zaneeta.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.482
Tommy, your word is "catharsis."

05:58.400 --> 06:00.444
-Catharsis. C-A--
-Hey!

06:01.528 --> 06:04.823
Children, say good morning
to our new handyman, Dr. Skinner.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.035
Good morning, Dr. Skinner.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.537
Hey, kids.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.373
'Sup.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.293
So, where should I start?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.129
The door to the supply closet
has been jammed for weeks.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.172
On it.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.174
Now, Tommy, let's resume.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.053
-Your word is "catharsis."
-Miss Tate?

06:27.179 --> 06:30.098
Yeah, this is really stuck.
Do you have any other jobs?

06:30.182 --> 06:31.517
So you're just going to give up?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.186
No, I'm not giving up.
I'm just moving on to something else.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.647
So, giving up.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.483
Children, what does
Shakespeare have to say about that?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.736
"Cowards die many times
before their death;

06:42.819 --> 06:45.948
the valiant never taste
of death but once."

06:46.698 --> 06:51.787
Shakespeare. So perceptive,
and so beautifully expressed.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.121
What does that even mean?

06:53.705 --> 06:57.000
It means that taking
the easy way out never pays.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.295
Let's see how I can explain it.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.883
Oh, seriously,
no musical explanation needed. I get it.

07:04.967 --> 07:11.849
When you've got a job to do
You must try with all your heart

07:11.932 --> 07:15.894
Life's profoundest joys
Go to girls and boys

07:15.978 --> 07:18.981
Who finish what they start

07:19.064 --> 07:23.402
When faced with work
The shirkers shirk because

07:23.485 --> 07:26.029
It's no longer fun

07:26.113 --> 07:29.324
But the chaps for whom
The whole world claps

07:29.408 --> 07:33.036
Are the chaps who keep at it
Till the job is done

07:33.120 --> 07:35.873
-Yeah.
-Oh, at times you'll want to say

07:36.748 --> 07:39.459
"I've got nothing left to give"

07:40.210 --> 07:44.715
But a life that's lived partway
Is no way to live

07:46.175 --> 07:47.176
Stop. Okay.

07:47.259 --> 07:54.224
So here's a slice of good advice
That I'm obliged to impart

07:54.308 --> 07:59.062
You must always try your best
With all of your heart

08:00.314 --> 08:03.150
Miss Tate is right.
How can you live a life partway?

08:03.233 --> 08:04.818
Or be half a friend?

08:04.902 --> 08:07.154
Why do you keep giving up, Dr. Skinner?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.280
Yeah. Why?

08:08.864 --> 08:11.158
Hey, back off. It's a door.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.492
Is it?

08:13.702 --> 08:17.581
-When you've got a job to do
-When you've got a job to do

08:17.664 --> 08:21.001
-You must try with all your heart
-You must try with all your heart

08:21.084 --> 08:22.461
Life's profoundest joys

08:22.544 --> 08:24.338
-Go to girls and boys
-Girls and boys

08:24.421 --> 08:28.008
-Who finish what they start
-S-T-A-R-T!

08:28.091 --> 08:31.136
When faced with work
The shirkers shirk

08:31.220 --> 08:34.847
-Because it's no longer fun
-F-U-N!

08:34.932 --> 08:38.184
But the chaps for whom
The whole world claps

08:38.268 --> 08:41.938
Are the chaps who keep at it
Till the job is done

08:42.022 --> 08:45.567
-Oh, at times you'll want to say
-Oh, at times you'll want to say

08:45.651 --> 08:49.196
-"I've got nothing left to give"
-"I've got nothing left to give"

08:49.279 --> 08:51.865
But a life that's lived partway

08:51.949 --> 08:56.036
-Is no way to live
-It's no way to L-I-V-E!

08:56.119 --> 09:03.043
So here's a slice of good advice
That I'm obliged to impart

09:03.126 --> 09:07.714
You must always try your best
With all of your heart

09:09.299 --> 09:11.468
Not into singing, huh? I get it.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.178
I'm no good at music.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.914
So here's a slice of good advice

10:21.997 --> 10:24.416
That I'm obliged to impart

10:24.499 --> 10:27.169
You must always try your best

10:28.670 --> 10:30.839
Though life puts you to the test

10:32.382 --> 10:37.012
You must always try your best

10:37.095 --> 10:38.347
With all of your

10:38.430 --> 10:40.599
Heart

10:40.682 --> 10:42.851
H-E-A-R-T!

10:42.935 --> 10:44.144
Heart!

10:46.730 --> 10:48.106
Yes!

10:48.815 --> 10:51.568
Why are they laughing?
Nothing even remotely funny just happened.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.099
Can I tempt you with anything?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.185
What would you recommend?

11:25.269 --> 11:28.063
Most folks are partial
to Helen Pritt's corn brittle

11:28.146 --> 11:30.107
or Aunt Polly's shoofly pie.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.485
Unfortunately, no one seems
to be interested in my rhubarb squares.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.696
Oh, I love rhubarb squares.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.239
You do? Me too.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.033
And I thought I was the only one.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.578
Well, they're definitely
not for everybody.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.665
-I'll take two.
-Wonderful.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.796
Here. I'd hate to enjoy it alone.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.131
Oh, thank you.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.051
Howard, don't forget your diet.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.804
We don't wanna have to get your fat pants
down from the attic again.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.431
Sorry, Mildred.

12:25.621 --> 12:26.830
I found you!

12:27.664 --> 12:30.167
Oh, don't worry, Nancy.
No, no, I'm here to help.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.877
I assume this is the father?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.879
Yes, ma'am. Seaman Freddy Driggs.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.714
Thank you for your service.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.676
You're pregnant and living in this shack?

12:39.760 --> 12:41.595
My parents don't want a scandal.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.639
But please don't tell them
Freddy was here.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.265
Nancy and I wanna get married, honest.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.142
But her ma doesn't approve of sailors

12:47.226 --> 12:50.020
on account of the way we curse
so dad gum much-- Sorry.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.563
So we can't.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.273
Hey. You'll get no judgment from me.

12:53.357 --> 12:56.193
I just wanna make sure
you and your baby are safe.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.444
How many months along are you?

12:57.528 --> 13:01.156
I'm not sure. I've got so many questions
and no idea who to ask.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.076
For instance,
where does the baby come out?

13:04.159 --> 13:07.329
I feel like there are a couple of options
but both seem crazy.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.457
The baby comes out of your vagina, Nancy.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.501
Really?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.670
Ma'am, I don't even
use language like that.

13:14.753 --> 13:18.090
It's just medical terminology, Freddy.
Nothing to be afraid of.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.261
Let's see if I can make it easier for you.

13:27.516 --> 13:31.395
Vagina is where the penis goes

13:31.478 --> 13:34.898
Ovaries make eggs for you and me

13:35.858 --> 13:39.111
Testes are where the sperm repose

13:39.194 --> 13:42.948
Cervix is where they can swim free

13:43.615 --> 13:46.952
Fallopian tubes are
Where both of them meet

13:47.828 --> 13:51.540
Uterus is where cells start to sprout

13:51.623 --> 13:55.335
Placenta is what they like to eat

13:55.419 --> 13:59.131
Till the baby comes straight out--

14:00.507 --> 14:02.467
-The vagina?
-That's right!

14:02.551 --> 14:03.635
Now sing with me.

14:05.470 --> 14:09.474
-Vagina
-Is where the penis goes

14:09.558 --> 14:13.562
-Ovaries
-Make eggs for you and me

14:13.645 --> 14:17.441
-Testes
-Are where the sperm repose

14:17.524 --> 14:21.528
-Cervix
-Is where they can swim free

14:21.612 --> 14:25.574
-Fallopian tubes
-Are where both of them meet

14:25.657 --> 14:29.328
-Uterus
-Is where cells start to sprout

14:29.411 --> 14:32.998
-Placenta
-Is what they like to eat

14:33.081 --> 14:37.753
Till the baby comes straight out
The vagina

14:42.257 --> 14:44.384
Ow! Son of a bitch.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.558
This must be the Skinner Feeling
I've heard so much about.

14:51.642 --> 14:55.604
Hey. Just trying to do my best
with all of my heart.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.440
Well, clearly the door's
gotten the better of you.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.485
Maybe try assaulting
the toolbox again tomorrow?

15:02.903 --> 15:04.363
You!

15:04.446 --> 15:05.948
Don't shoot!

15:06.031 --> 15:07.324
I'm not gonna shoot.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
'Cause you're headed
with me and my Betsy right now

15:09.493 --> 15:10.869
to the church to get married.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.912
What?

15:11.995 --> 15:15.457
Hey! You listen here,
Patrick McDoogal McDonough.

15:15.541 --> 15:16.959
You will not come into my classroom

15:17.042 --> 15:18.669
waving a gun around
and ranting like a lunatic.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.753
Do you understand me?

15:19.837 --> 15:21.171
Yes, ma'am.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.131
Do you really think so little
of your daughter

15:23.215 --> 15:25.968
that you feel the need to threaten men
to get them to marry her?

15:26.051 --> 15:28.470
-Do you, Papa?
-Well, I thought--

15:28.554 --> 15:31.265
I don't see a whole lot of thinking
going on in that head of yours.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.685
But you are going to go home
and think about your behavior,

15:34.768 --> 15:36.895
and let your daughter live her own life.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.106
-Is that clear?
-Yes, ma'am.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.066
Can I have my gun?

15:41.149 --> 15:44.778
You will get this back when I think
you have learned your lesson. Now get.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.579
Thank you.

15:54.288 --> 15:58.625
Must be hard being the only one around
here with an actual functioning brain.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.795
They're not so bad.
They're just set in their ways, is all.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.674
I try to encourage them
to be more modern, but…

16:06.925 --> 16:08.427
Have you heard of a brassiere?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.014
-Rings a bell.
-It's a wonderful new invention

16:12.097 --> 16:15.184
that frees the woman's bosom
from the bondage of the corset.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.560
I love it.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.355
But of course Mildred and her biddies
have banned them. It's ridiculous.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.733
So ridiculous. Brassieres are the best.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.654
I imagine we all must seem
very provincial and backwards

16:27.738 --> 16:30.782
to someone as cosmopolitan as yourself.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.453
So, what's it like
where you come from? The big city.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.039
Well…

16:38.415 --> 16:40.125
No, no, no, no!

16:40.209 --> 16:43.420
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
-I'm not doing this.

16:43.504 --> 16:46.256
Okay. Fine. Don't tell me.

16:46.340 --> 16:48.842
-Have a nice evening, Dr. Skinner.
-No--

16:54.389 --> 16:56.683
So in the future, Pete,

16:56.767 --> 17:00.646
let's stay away from
boiling pots of corn puddin', okay?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.940
Just knowing you and your whole deal.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.242
Ow!

17:17.412 --> 17:20.249
So you're a nurse now. Where's the doctor?

17:20.332 --> 17:21.290
He's out fishing.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.085
What do you want? Why are you here?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.046
I kinda-- I was…

17:26.128 --> 17:27.881
-You need my help.
-Yeah.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.050
Really? Don't know if you remember,

17:30.133 --> 17:32.219
but we're broken up and I hate you.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.097
I know, I know.
But I have nowhere else to turn. Please.

17:36.849 --> 17:37.891
Fine. What is it?

17:37.975 --> 17:39.810
Okay, so you remember when
I tried to cross the bridge

17:39.893 --> 17:40.894
with every woman in town?

17:40.978 --> 17:43.063
Yes, I remember.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.899
There's one woman in town I missed.
Emma Tate, the schoolmarm.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.860
So I'm thinking she must be my ticket out.

17:47.943 --> 17:49.695
You gonna find true love
with the schoolmarm?

17:49.778 --> 17:52.030
I don't know.
I just know it's not going well.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.408
Yesterday we were talking and
then music started to play out of nowhere,

17:54.491 --> 17:55.367
and she stormed off.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.911
-You were supposed to sing.
-I guess.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.998
Josh, you're in a musical.
That's how musicals work.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.791
When you're too emotional to talk,
you sing.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.626
When you're too emotional to sing,
you dance.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.503
What happens when
you're too emotional to dance?

18:06.587 --> 18:08.005
Does it loop back around to talking?

18:08.088 --> 18:10.090
'Cause I feel like that's
where I'm at right now.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.843
Look, there's gotta be another way.
You know musicals.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.721
Any tips for me? Like what musical I'm in.

18:16.805 --> 18:20.267
I'm so torn
between really not wanting to help you

18:20.350 --> 18:23.520
and really wanting
to show off how much I know.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.190
Damn it. Okay.

18:26.273 --> 18:30.110
She's a teacher accompanied
by a young boy. That's very Music Man.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.486
And who would I be in that?

18:31.570 --> 18:34.948
Harold Hill. A morally adrift narcissist
who needs to change.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.700
-All right.
-Or it could be King and I.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.827
-In that I'm…
-A morally adrift narcissist

18:38.911 --> 18:39.912
who needs to change.

18:39.995 --> 18:42.414
Okay, now I feel like
that's just your opinion of me.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.458
-You're gonna have to sing, Josh.
-Not happening.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.419
So what did the Music Man do
to win over the teacher in their musical?

18:48.086 --> 18:50.547
-He gave her little brother a trumpet.
-Why?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.759
Why "Shipoopi"? I don't know.
Do you need to know the whole plot?

18:53.842 --> 18:55.135
-How much time do you have?
-Never mind.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.428
Trumpet. Little brother. Got it.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.639
-I think it's a little more than that.
-Nurse Melissa!

18:58.722 --> 19:00.349
-Nurse Melissa!
-I'm a doctor.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.059
I think I'm having the baby!

19:02.142 --> 19:03.769
Okay. Come on in. Let's do this.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.687
-But Doc Lopez--
-Screw Doc Lopez.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.147
Let's get you on the table.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.403
Okay.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.030
What are you doing?

19:15.113 --> 19:16.281
Figured you could use a hand.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.284
Yeah, I could.

19:30.546 --> 19:31.755
That was amazing.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.758
-You were amazing.
-No.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.885
-You were.
-Okay, I was.

19:36.969 --> 19:40.097
But to be fair,
being in a musical made it pretty easy.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.850
It's the first time I've ever had
a baby come out completely dry.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.017
Yeah, that was weird.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.145
But it was great to have your help,
so thank you.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.356
Happy to do it.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.361
Guess you better go find that trumpet.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.947
Yeah. Right.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.324
Good luck.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.578
-Good luck to you too.
-Thanks.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.148
Is it true what I heard?

20:31.231 --> 20:33.817
Did you deliver Nancy's baby
against my orders?

20:33.901 --> 20:35.611
Yes, because I'm a doctor.

20:35.694 --> 20:39.489
I am. And you know
what doctors are supposed to do?

20:39.573 --> 20:40.824
Help people.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.284
Well, you had no right to do that.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.953
This is my practice and I make the rules.

20:45.037 --> 20:47.706
Speaking of, how did this tube end up
on my parents' nightstand?

20:47.789 --> 20:48.999
I gave it to them.

20:49.625 --> 20:53.045
You have no boundaries. No decency.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.674
I have no decency?

20:57.758 --> 21:00.260
You refused to treat a woman in need.

21:00.344 --> 21:04.223
I'm sorry. I don't care
how ridiculously handsome you are.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.350
You're just wrong. About Nancy,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.393
about your parents, about everything.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.647
If your parents wanna have sex,
let them have sex.

21:11.730 --> 21:13.398
In fact, you know what?

21:13.941 --> 21:16.944
I'm not only gonna keep encouraging
your parents to get it on,

21:17.027 --> 21:19.947
I'm gonna teach them ways
to make their sex lives even better.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.740
Every position in the Kama-sutra.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.576
Pleasure for the sake of pleasure itself.

21:24.660 --> 21:29.790
And finally, in spite of you,
they are going to truly live.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.838
We are gathered here today to say goodbye

21:35.921 --> 21:37.339
to Old Doc Lopez,

21:37.422 --> 21:40.050
who unexpectedly left us this week

21:40.133 --> 21:42.970
as a result of engaging in
what is apparently known as

21:43.053 --> 21:44.596
an "Egyptian hucklebuck."

21:45.889 --> 21:48.267
We all must experience sorrow,

21:48.350 --> 21:51.979
but it seems the Lopez family
has endured much more than its share.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.649
Just two years ago,
I was up here delivering the eulogy

21:55.732 --> 21:58.277
for Jorge's dear wife, Norma.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.740
So, what do we do
when life hands us tragedy like this?

22:04.950 --> 22:08.537
When the love of God is so far away?

22:09.705 --> 22:12.291
And hope so distant?

22:15.002 --> 22:16.628
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.006
Are you all right?

22:19.089 --> 22:20.382
It was my fault.

22:20.465 --> 22:24.845
I'm the one who encouraged him
to stretch his sexual repertoire.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.889
That heart attack was gonna happen
no matter what.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.849
You know that, right?
It was just hibernating.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.809
-A wise man once said…
-I guess.

22:32.603 --> 22:34.188
So, that's your doctor, huh?

22:34.271 --> 22:37.649
He's moderately attractive.
For a man his age.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.485
How's it going with your schoolmarm?

22:40.569 --> 22:42.487
Can't find a trumpet anywhere.

22:42.571 --> 22:45.115
I still don't see how that's gonna
make her fall in love with me.

22:45.199 --> 22:48.118
Look, romance in musicals
isn't always logical. Okay?

22:48.202 --> 22:50.787
That's why they usually let
the songs do the heavy lifting.

22:50.871 --> 22:52.080
I'm not singing.

22:52.164 --> 22:55.167
Are we truly living our lives
to the fullest?

22:56.710 --> 22:59.379
Do we have the courage
to always follow our hearts?

23:00.339 --> 23:03.842
And are we using everything
God has blessed us with?

23:03.926 --> 23:07.221
He makes a great point, huh?
About following our hearts.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.892
I'd like to. I would. But…

23:11.975 --> 23:16.063
Because our brief sojourn here
on earth is a gift from God.

23:17.022 --> 23:20.567
And he would not have us
waste a single minute of it.

23:22.694 --> 23:23.904
You know what?

23:24.988 --> 23:25.989
You're right.

23:26.073 --> 23:29.701
A wise man once said,
"The stars are always shining…

23:30.702 --> 23:33.622
-but it's only at night"--
-Oh, no. I didn't mean right now.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.542
Reverend,
I have something I'd like to say.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.918
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.756
The reverend is right.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.969
Life is precious,
and we shouldn't waste a single minute.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.805
So…

23:50.514 --> 23:53.934
there's something
I've wanted to say for years…

23:55.018 --> 23:56.603
but have never had the courage.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.398
Florence,

24:00.148 --> 24:02.568
my dearest, I love you so much.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.070
But…

24:06.655 --> 24:09.157
I'm a homosexual.

24:11.535 --> 24:12.744
A what?

24:14.913 --> 24:19.960
I'm a homosexual

24:20.043 --> 24:25.340
It's no longer subtextual

24:25.424 --> 24:27.801
I'm attracted to men

24:28.427 --> 24:32.890
Not you men, you're dull

24:34.099 --> 24:41.064
But I'm a homosexual

24:47.446 --> 24:48.864
Florence, wait!

25:00.792 --> 25:03.462
-Hey, Carson.
-Hey, Dr. Skinner.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.255
Got a little something for ya.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.383
What's that?

25:08.467 --> 25:09.593
It's a kazoo.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.221
And I know you'd probably prefer a trumpet
but there aren't any in town.

25:12.304 --> 25:13.764
And besides, a kazoo is much better

25:13.847 --> 25:16.266
because you don't have to take lessons
or practice, or anything.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.560
You just hum into it and music comes out.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.359
The other kids will just make fun of me.

25:26.109 --> 25:29.488
-Why do you say that?
-Because they always make fun of me.

25:29.571 --> 25:32.574
I'm an outcast.
I guess I just don't fit in.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.495
I know how you feel, buddy.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.622
-You do?
-Sure.

25:38.705 --> 25:41.166
When I was in school to be a doctor,
I didn't fit in either.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.544
There wasn't anybody like me
in my whole group.

25:43.627 --> 25:46.922
And to tell the truth,
it got pretty lonely sometimes.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.258
But you know what I did?
I said, "Screw 'em."

25:49.341 --> 25:50.509
"Screw 'em"?

25:52.970 --> 25:56.306
I realized it didn't matter
what they thought.

25:56.390 --> 25:58.392
It only mattered what I thought.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.270
And so I worked hard, I became a doctor,

26:01.353 --> 26:03.355
and now I have a ton of friends.

26:03.981 --> 26:07.526
Including Carmelo Anthony,
who is a famous basketball player,

26:07.609 --> 26:11.822
whose knee I once fixed
and hooked me up with courtside seats.

26:11.905 --> 26:15.409
And those babies go for, like,
$2,500 a pop.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.703
-Wow!
-Exactly. So, come on.

26:18.912 --> 26:19.913
Give it a try.

26:25.878 --> 26:27.087
Right.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.467
Wow! I did it! I made music!

26:33.260 --> 26:36.180
-Sister! Sister! Sister!
-Yes?

26:36.263 --> 26:38.891
Dr. Skinner gave me
the most amazing thing ever!

26:38.974 --> 26:41.518
A kazoo! Look, I can make music!

26:46.690 --> 26:48.066
That's great!

26:52.571 --> 26:53.780
Holy shit, it worked.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.921
Doctor?

27:11.089 --> 27:12.090
Are you all right?

27:13.634 --> 27:17.846
Oh, Melissa.
Sorry, I was just out here thinking.

27:18.889 --> 27:20.140
It's been quite a day.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.061
I didn't know about your wife.

27:24.144 --> 27:27.439
I'm so sorry.
You must have loved her very much.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.192
Yes, I did.

27:30.275 --> 27:34.571
And I want you to know
how sorry I am about your father.

27:35.364 --> 27:38.033
I feel like if it weren't for me,
he'd still be around.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.869
Oh, no, no.
Melissa, you must never blame yourself.

27:40.953 --> 27:42.329
Never.

27:42.412 --> 27:46.416
Because of you, his last moments
were filled with joy. And love.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.878
No thanks to me. No, no.

27:49.962 --> 27:52.840
I am Dr. Jorge Sebastian Federico Lopez,

27:52.923 --> 27:56.218
a controlling perfectionist who
won't just let people be who they are.

27:56.301 --> 27:59.304
I hate that about myself. I hate it.

27:59.388 --> 28:03.934
Well, I mean, there are
positive aspects to those qualities too.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.602
That's what I told myself.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.689
And in the meantime,
I was making the people I love miserable.

28:09.731 --> 28:13.527
But then you showed up,
standing up to me, speaking your mind.

28:13.610 --> 28:16.071
Yes, initially I hated it,

28:16.154 --> 28:17.573
but now I've realized…

28:18.907 --> 28:20.158
that you were right.

28:20.784 --> 28:23.620
And I was wrong. About everything.

28:23.704 --> 28:27.833
That's the sexiest thing
any man has ever said to me.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.252
You've changed me, Melissa.

28:31.503 --> 28:32.504
Thank you.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.304
How does this even work?

28:43.015 --> 28:44.016
Any luck?

28:45.517 --> 28:46.518
Nope.

28:48.437 --> 28:50.522
I'm kind of the worst handyman ever.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.232
Been here a week, haven't fixed anything.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.483
Except Carson.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.320
Thank you for reaching out to him.

28:57.196 --> 29:00.866
He's had such a hard time growing up
without a mother or a father.

29:01.491 --> 29:04.161
I've tried introducing
the important things in life to him.

29:04.244 --> 29:09.041
You know, compassion, integrity,
that there should always be a third thing.

29:09.124 --> 29:12.211
But clearly there's so much
I've denied him.

29:12.294 --> 29:13.837
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.465
He's a great kid,
and that's because of you.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.383
A lot of people
in this town would disagree.

29:18.467 --> 29:19.718
Who cares what they think?

29:20.552 --> 29:22.387
You're better
than all of them put together.

29:25.057 --> 29:26.934
Josh Skinner.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.478
You are not the man
that I thought you were.

29:31.522 --> 29:32.606
Doctor?

29:32.689 --> 29:35.609
Melissa, what the mayor
did today has inspired me.

29:36.860 --> 29:40.572
I know this is sudden,
but I don't wanna waste another minute.

29:41.365 --> 29:46.870
Suddenly I find myself forgetting

29:47.538 --> 29:53.126
All the things
That bounce around my brain

29:53.210 --> 29:58.131
Suddenly I want to plan a wedding

29:58.799 --> 30:04.346
Although I know
That's perfectly insane

30:05.013 --> 30:10.018
There's no sense
In trying to explain it

30:10.936 --> 30:16.149
What and where and why
And when and how

30:16.859 --> 30:22.364
All I know is suddenly I love you

30:23.031 --> 30:29.955
And suddenly that's
All that matters now

30:31.164 --> 30:34.501
-Emma…
-If this seems sudden, well, it is.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.671
But after what happened
today at the funeral,

30:37.754 --> 30:40.924
it just feels wrong to keep it inside.

30:41.508 --> 30:46.763
Suddenly it seems I'm not the teacher

30:47.389 --> 30:51.935
And there's so much more
For me to learn

30:53.061 --> 30:58.567
Suddenly I want to call a preacher

30:58.650 --> 31:03.739
And that's the sort of thought
I used to spurn

31:04.781 --> 31:10.120
There's no sense
In trying to explain it

31:10.662 --> 31:15.959
What and where and why
And when and how

31:16.752 --> 31:22.758
All I know is suddenly I love you

31:22.841 --> 31:29.431
And suddenly that's
All that matters now

31:59.002 --> 32:04.758
There's no sense
In trying to explain it

32:04.842 --> 32:10.514
What and where and why
And when and how

32:11.390 --> 32:17.938
All I know is suddenly I love you

32:18.605 --> 32:23.902
And suddenly that's all that matters

32:23.986 --> 32:27.239
Now

32:48.927 --> 32:52.806
-When you've got a job to do
-When you've got a job to do

32:52.890 --> 32:56.226
-You must try with all your heart
-You must try with all your heart

32:56.310 --> 32:57.686
Life's profoundest joys

32:57.769 --> 32:59.563
-Go to girls and boys
-Girls and boys

32:59.646 --> 33:03.233
-Who finish what they start
-S-T-A-R-T!

33:03.317 --> 33:10.032
So here's a slice of good advice
That I'm obliged to impart

33:10.115 --> 33:14.912
You must always try your best
With all of your heart

33:50.989 --> 33:53.534
So here's a slice of good advice

33:53.617 --> 33:56.036
That I'm obliged to impart

33:56.119 --> 33:58.622
You must always try your best

33:58.705 --> 34:01.124
Though life puts you to the test

34:01.208 --> 34:05.838
You must always try your best

34:05.921 --> 34:07.172
With all of your

34:07.256 --> 34:10.759
-Heart
-H-E-A-R-T!
