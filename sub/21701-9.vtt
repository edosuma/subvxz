WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.433 --> 00:12.333
House party!
(cheering, laughter)

00:12.400 --> 00:15.667
It's Aaron's birthday.
Let's fucking have it!

00:15.733 --> 00:17.967
(cheering)

00:19.067 --> 00:20.767
I feel great tonight.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.000
Me and Ryan are off to the shag
pad
for a little sleepover.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.933
you don't pull,
Abbie will have beat you.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.200
yeah

00:29.267 --> 00:30.600
This is awkward.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.467
That girl!

00:36.367 --> 00:38.267
(giggling)
I am fucking back.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.433
I'm in bed mortal and can't help
but say them three little words.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.267
What?

00:47.333 --> 00:48.433
Fuck!

00:48.500 --> 00:50.400
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.900
I said I love you.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.833
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

00:55.900 --> 00:58.433
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.833
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.967
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:04.033 --> 01:05.933
I'm preened to perfection.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.400
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:08.467 --> 01:11.233
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:11.300 --> 01:14.167
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:14.233 --> 01:17.333
My quiff's pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.900
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:34.367 --> 01:36.067
Wakey-wakey!

01:36.900 --> 01:37.933
Oh, yes!

01:38.000 --> 01:40.700
Top shagger!
That was the touch of a shagger.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.000
(sighs contentedly)
How was it?

01:44.067 --> 01:45.167
(indistinct)

01:45.233 --> 01:49.700
I don't want to give away too
much,
but I've hardly had any sleep.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.733
Marnie kept getting in my bed
and out.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.633
I went, "Goodnight. Love you."

01:53.700 --> 01:56.867
Last night Marnie said
she wasn't ready for a
relationship,

01:56.933 --> 01:59.900
so I thought I'd give her space
and we'd sleep on our own.

01:59.967 --> 02:03.667
But I've got a feeling I didn't
help
by telling her I fucking loved
her.

02:03.733 --> 02:06.733
She come back and kissed us
on the cheek and went to bed.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.133
Aaron's trying to brush off
what he said.

02:09.199 --> 02:13.100
I know him better than anyone.
I know that kid's in love.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.867
I'm just not sure
Marnie feels the same.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.867
(Nathan) Morning.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.367
It doesn't matter if you care
about Gary or not,

02:25.433 --> 02:27.733
be honest,
did it make you a bit jealous?

02:27.800 --> 02:30.967
yellow, he pulled, but it's fair
game, do you know what I mean?

02:31.033 --> 02:33.767
If I hadn't got with
Gary's best mate,

02:33.833 --> 02:35.767
I probably would have kicked
off.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.867
But we're even now. It's fair
game.

02:37.933 --> 02:40.000
Yous, are yous listening?

02:40.067 --> 02:45.300
Last night, as I was leaving,
Aaron went... "Love you."

02:46.900 --> 02:48.567
What are you gonna do about it?

02:48.633 --> 02:51.567
It's a different story
if he said it when he was sober.

02:51.633 --> 02:54.400
Aaron went and dropped the
L-bomb
last night.

02:54.467 --> 02:57.233
Marnie says he just said it
because he's mortal,

02:57.300 --> 03:02.600
but the fact is the truth
always comes out when you're
drunk.

03:02.667 --> 03:03.867
(fart)

03:03.933 --> 03:05.400
Was that you?
No.

03:05.467 --> 03:06.833
It was me.

03:09.133 --> 03:12.700
Everyone... howay! Breakfast!

03:14.133 --> 03:16.233
Gary's called us all for
breakfast,

03:16.300 --> 03:18.900
and Abbie is down there
faster than Usain Bolt.

03:18.967 --> 03:22.900
Either she's starving or she
wants
to know the gossip from last
night.

03:22.967 --> 03:24.133
So, did you shag?

03:24.200 --> 03:26.900
Er... yes.

03:26.967 --> 03:30.400
You did? Whoa!
(Sophie) A man should never
tell!

03:30.467 --> 03:32.833
Me and Gary
have both shagged other people

03:32.900 --> 03:35.067
and things are still cool
between us.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.167
That's the way it should be.

03:37.233 --> 03:40.567
Be careful cooking in this
disgusting mess. You'll get ill.

03:40.633 --> 03:43.633
I'm hoping today can be
as chilled as yesterday

03:43.700 --> 03:45.267
when we binned off work.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.200
But I'm worried Anna has been
quiet
since then.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.733
(Anna) Hi, folks.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.133
Hi, Anna. Can you gather round,
please? Gather round the sofas.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.733
First thing that comes to my
head is
we fucked work off yesterday.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.833
Shit!

04:09.900 --> 04:13.067
So, yesterday,
I sent Gary, Marnie and Aaron

04:13.133 --> 04:15.833
to flyer Newcastle
to drum up some business.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.333
How did it go?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.200
yellow, decent.

04:20.367 --> 04:23.400
We're handing flyers out
saying come to Newcastle...

04:23.467 --> 04:24.933
...in Newcastle.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.033
So we chucked them in the bin.
You chucked them in the bin?

04:30.067 --> 04:32.167
We're in the shit now, aren't
we?

04:32.233 --> 04:36.167
Well, as a punishment, you three
are
going on the streets of
Newcastle

04:36.233 --> 04:37.800
to pick up chewing gum.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.900
(laughter)
There's your uniforms.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.200
If you went to work
in the first place,

04:44.267 --> 04:46.567
you wouldn't have to do this,
would you?

04:46.633 --> 04:49.667
The rest of yous, three of yous,

04:49.733 --> 04:52.733
I want you to go and make a
jingle
to advertise Toon Tours.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.667
(Chloe) Jingle?! What's that?

04:54.733 --> 04:58.300
The only jingle I know is Jingle
Bells, and it's not Christmas.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.900
Get ready, you've got your
uniforms
for today.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.333
Bye, Anna.
Bye.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.967
(various) Bye, Anna.

05:08.267 --> 05:12.033
I'm going to let Nathan, Abbie
and Chloe go off and do a
jingle.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.900
I'd much rather clean the house
than make an absolute tit of
myself.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.600
This is a joke.
I don't know what's worse,

05:19.667 --> 05:22.233
picking up gum
or wearing bright yellow vests.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.600
Was skiving really worth it?

05:27.900 --> 05:30.100
Bye, Sophie.
Bye, Sophie.

05:30.167 --> 05:33.567
Make sure you get everything
spick and spam. (flies buzz)

05:42.467 --> 05:45.933
We're on the quayside,
scraping chewing gum off the
floor.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.367
I've never been so embarrassed
in my life.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.533
This is absolutely pathetic.

05:53.467 --> 05:57.667
Work together, play together,
stay together. (laughter)

06:00.067 --> 06:03.900
Aaron's asleep. That means
there's
only me and Marnie scraping gum.

06:03.967 --> 06:07.700
This will be a good chance to
have
a word and see where they are
at.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.733
He has made us really happy
in a long time.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.767
But I've got a massive guard up
when it comes to Aaron.

06:16.833 --> 06:20.033
I think Aaron is besotted by
you.
Besotted is fair enough.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.733
I'm besotted by him.
You've got to drop that wall.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.067
Gary gives really good advice.
He's right.

06:25.133 --> 06:28.833
I need to be honest with Aaron
and
tell him why I've been so
guarded.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.900
I hope he sees
where I'm coming from.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.467
If not, we're in trouble.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.733
You and Aaron need to talk about
it.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.100
I'm not going to say anything,
I'm not taking sides.

06:38.167 --> 06:40.733
It's a big talk to have,
but yous need to have it.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.400
Yeah.
Right, howay.

06:42.467 --> 06:46.567
I will definitely think twice
before
throwing chewing gum on the
floor.

06:46.633 --> 06:50.267
But for now, I am done.
Get me back to that house.

06:58.733 --> 06:59.800
Done.

06:59.867 --> 07:02.267
I hate cleaning
and I'm fucking knackered.

07:02.333 --> 07:06.500
Now it's time to chill out,
unwind and relax.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.767
Hello, you.
Hello, you.

07:10.833 --> 07:13.333
Fucking hell! You cleaned up?
I actually did.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.033
You've done well.
Well done.

07:17.267 --> 07:20.200
We've arrived at the studio
and it's the real deal.

07:20.267 --> 07:23.933
Anna wants a proper jingle
so that she can sell the
business.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.767
Write words that rhyme with
"tours" and "toon".

07:26.833 --> 07:28.833
Toon.
Baboon.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.967
Abbie and Chloe haven't got
a brain stem between them,

07:32.033 --> 07:33.967
so it's down to me
to write this song.

07:34.033 --> 07:36.000
# Newcastle is full of kebabs

07:36.067 --> 07:38.000
# And all the girls
Are massive slags

07:38.067 --> 07:40.200
(laughter)
That's a good one.

07:40.267 --> 07:42.500
Do it once.
Go ch-ch-ch at the beginning.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.300
Don't do it again until the end.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.333
What a fucking liberty.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.533
One, two, three, go!

07:47.600 --> 07:49.467
# Ch-ch-ch, Toon Tours!

07:49.533 --> 07:51.800
# Go clubbing at night
# Toon Tours!

07:51.867 --> 07:53.367
Yeah, that's good!

07:53.433 --> 07:57.133
We fucking nailed that jingle.
Maybe I should be a rapper.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.000
How are we that good?!

08:02.333 --> 08:04.700
Bijoux, Tup Tup, going to
Floritas.

08:04.767 --> 08:08.033
All that we need is a good
senorita.
(laughter)

08:08.100 --> 08:11.833
The others still aren't back
from
work. How hard can this jingle
be?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.600
I bet it'll be fucking shite.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.667
I think we did a good song,
we performed it amazingly.

08:16.733 --> 08:17.767
Anna will be proud.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.667
I cannot wait for everyone
to hear our jingle.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.300
Rihanna has got nowt on us,
like.

08:23.367 --> 08:24.700
I hope they like it.

08:24.767 --> 08:27.300
Hiya! Is everyone here?

08:27.367 --> 08:28.600
Yeah, we're ready.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.433
The others come back from work.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.167
I can tell,
before they even press play,

08:33.232 --> 08:35.033
this jingle is gonna be shit.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.866
# Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch, Toon Tours!

08:39.933 --> 08:42.167
(Nathan stutters)
# Toon Tours!

08:42.232 --> 08:44.232
# Party crew!
# Toon Tours!

08:44.300 --> 08:45.867
# So see the sights

08:45.933 --> 08:48.033
# Toon Tours!
# Come party at night

08:48.100 --> 08:51.033
This is never, ever gonna get
any custom to Newcastle.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.867
If anything,
it's gonna scare the fuckers
off.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.800
(laughter)
That is the fucking worst.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.500
They've been out all day

08:58.567 --> 09:01.933
and come back with a jingle
that lasted about five seconds.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.233
Fucking hell!

09:03.300 --> 09:06.967
Girls, let's get ready for
tonight.
Oh, there's the lead singer.

09:07.033 --> 09:09.767
Come on, Kelly, come on,
Michelle.
Always a diva.

09:09.833 --> 09:11.200
Toon Tours!
Bye, guys.

09:11.267 --> 09:13.300
Look at Nathan's band.
Toon Tours!

09:13.367 --> 09:16.233
(all) # I wanna have a life
Toon Tours!

09:20.733 --> 09:24.367
Tonight is going to be
an amazing night. Let's get on
one!

09:36.500 --> 09:40.467
Girls! (Marnie) Everyone's
buzzing,
but I need to have a chat with
Aaron

09:40.533 --> 09:41.933
so I'm dreading it.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.233
Let's have it!
(various) Cheers!

09:46.500 --> 09:48.333
I think we're in for a good one.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.100
Maybe if you treat us better
we'd still be together now.

09:54.167 --> 09:56.800
Oh, fuck off, man.
You fuck off! Fucking divvy.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.333
I don't even know
if we'll ever fix this.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.867
Smash his fucking head in!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:06.000 --> 10:06.200
.

10:08.700 --> 10:08.900
.

10:18.833 --> 10:21.667
We get to Bijou and thank fuck,
it's banging.

10:21.733 --> 10:23.100
(shouting)

10:23.167 --> 10:25.000
I think we're in for a good one
tonight.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.900
Everyone knows that Marnie
and Aaron want different things
now.

10:43.967 --> 10:46.433
That's everyone apart from
Aaron.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.267
Talking to Sophie feels so easy
to tell her how I feel about
Aaron.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.233
When I'm talking to him
it's gonna be a different story,

11:05.300 --> 11:06.367
and I'm dreading it.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.500
I'm so glad to me and Gary are
cool.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.967
Things could have got
awkward between us.

11:38.033 --> 11:40.567
We've become really good mates.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.933
That's what good mates do.
Right?

11:56.633 --> 11:59.067
Even though
me and Gary have both pulled,

11:59.133 --> 12:01.967
there's definitely still a spark
cos here he is,

12:02.033 --> 12:04.500
on a night out,
still cracking on with us,

12:04.567 --> 12:05.800
and I'm fine with that.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.433
(Marnie) I feel so nervous.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.700
I don't know why.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.300
I think it's because
he wants more than I do.

12:37.867 --> 12:40.800
I can't believe
Marnie is putting this on me
again.

12:40.867 --> 12:43.000
She fucked off with someone
else.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.233
I didn't shit on her.
She shat on me.

12:59.867 --> 13:04.000
I moved on with someone else,
Aaron,
because you treat me like shit.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.633
What don't you get about it?

13:05.700 --> 13:08.500
Maybe if you treat us better
we'd still be together.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.067
(Sophie)
It's such a shame their
conversation

13:22.133 --> 13:24.933
looks the total opposite
of relationship goals.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.067
Fuck! This is a mess.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.467
At work today, I told Marnie
to drop her guard with Aaron.

13:51.533 --> 13:55.067
But it looks like
she's fucking buried it.

13:59.767 --> 14:03.367
Everyone is on Marnie's side
because she's playing the
victim.

14:03.433 --> 14:05.367
It's a good job I've got Gaz.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.333
And, to be fair, that's all I
need.

14:21.367 --> 14:22.900
This night has gone to shit.

14:22.967 --> 14:25.333
I fucked Marnie off
and she's fucked me off.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.667
That's the last thing
I wanted to happen.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.200
I don't even know
if we'll be able to fix this.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.767
This is heart-breaking.

14:39.833 --> 14:42.700
It looks like
Maron isn't gonna happen.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.033
(Chloe) The night has not ended
well.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.733
Marnie and Aaron have kicked off
so I'm getting everyone out here

15:09.800 --> 15:12.800
cos maybe some fresh air
will clear their heads.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.133
(Nathan) Hello, you! Go, go, go!

15:25.400 --> 15:27.500
(yells) Yes!

15:29.533 --> 15:32.433
All I'm doing is eating
and keeping my head down.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.900
Cos if I make eye contact
with Marnie,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.200
it's gonna kick off
and I don't want that.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.767
I think I need to go on a diet.
I look like I'm with child

15:40.833 --> 15:43.033
(laughter)

15:43.100 --> 15:45.167
Don't worry about that. Have a
dip.

15:45.233 --> 15:47.000
One more won't hurt.
Won't hurt.

15:47.067 --> 15:49.467
Tonight is like Christmas Eve,

15:49.533 --> 15:52.200
cos tomorrow
is our last full day in the
house.

15:52.267 --> 15:56.133
At night, no twatting around. We
need
to get to bed so we are fresh.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.333
Not when you were with
another girl last night.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.467
Nice one for trying, though.
See you.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.333
I'm pissed off.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.400
Tonight me and Aaron argued.
Again.

16:20.467 --> 16:22.933
I'm just gonna
deal with it tomorrow.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.967
(Aaron) Night, Gary,
you skinny little bitch!

16:40.833 --> 16:43.167
(yawns)

16:43.233 --> 16:46.000
That chat I had with her
turned sour very quickly.

16:46.067 --> 16:48.367
What, last night?
Very quickly.

16:48.433 --> 16:50.400
It's the last day, so all we
need now

16:50.467 --> 16:52.867
is Marnie and Aaron
to sort their shit out.

16:52.933 --> 16:57.667
I hate being frosty on the last
day.
I want it to be nice.

16:57.733 --> 17:00.100
I was gutted when I woke up
without Marnie.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.900
We can't agree what we want,
so we get pissed off.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.967
I just hope we can make up
before we leave the house.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.733
Morning. What about you and
Aaron?
I seen you arguing last night.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.400
He's just very, very
argumentative,
isn't he?

17:21.467 --> 17:24.800
Now I understand why I was
so nervous about chatting to
Aaron.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.933
It's cos I knew
it was gonna go to shit.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.200
I don't want to leave here
on bad terms,

17:29.267 --> 17:31.867
but I also want to avoid
having that chat again.

17:31.933 --> 17:33.667
(sighs) Oh, I don't know.

17:33.733 --> 17:36.300
Gary was very flirty with you
last night.

17:36.367 --> 17:40.100
He was flirting with us and he
was
like, "We're gonna go for a
cuddle."

17:40.167 --> 17:41.667
I went, "Oh, I dunno."

17:41.733 --> 17:45.700
It wasn't easy saying no to Gaz
last
night cos we do like each other,

17:45.767 --> 17:48.167
but I know our friendship is
more important.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.433
Bravo to that.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.367
Bravo.

17:52.433 --> 17:55.033
This is our last full day
in the house,

17:55.100 --> 17:58.467
so we need a good, old pile-on!

17:58.533 --> 18:02.167
Shag him! Shag him! Shag him!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:02.233 --> 18:05.967
Shag him! Shag him!
(shouting, groaning)

18:06.033 --> 18:09.567
He's definitely got a stiffy.
Chloe, your tits are in my face.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.433
I'm excited.
It's ages we've been in here
now.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.733
I know it does, doesn't it?
(phone rings)

18:19.800 --> 18:20.833
Ah, hell!

18:20.900 --> 18:24.133
Me and Nathan are chilling
on the sofa and the phone rings.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.600
Fuck's sake,
there's only one day left.

18:26.667 --> 18:27.800
I hope it's not Anna.

18:27.867 --> 18:31.167
(sultry voice) Hello, sex line.
"Hi, Sophie. How are you?"

18:31.233 --> 18:33.600
Eh? How did she know it was me?

18:33.667 --> 18:36.433
"I've got a job for you,
you're going to Durham."

18:36.500 --> 18:39.300
"Now, I need you to hand out
flyers
for Toon Tours

18:39.367 --> 18:43.033
while singing the jingle
that the others recorded
yesterday."

18:43.100 --> 18:44.233
Oh, I'm up for that.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.833
I can't believe it.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.300
It's our last day and now she's
saying we've got to work again.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.033
Bye.
"See you later."

18:51.100 --> 18:53.733
That cannot be work.
Right, go on.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.733
Me, Abbie and Chloe...
have got to go to Durham,

18:57.800 --> 19:00.933
and hand out flyers
dressed in a costume.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.200
(laughs)
What?

19:02.267 --> 19:05.433
Me, Abbie and Sophie
are going to work? You what?!

19:05.500 --> 19:08.933
Is that a joke?
Are you ready for this bit?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.933
We've got to sing the jingle.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.633
(laughter)
Oh, my God!

19:13.700 --> 19:14.867
Wow!

19:14.933 --> 19:17.300
Let's go for a drink
and watch them do this.

19:17.367 --> 19:18.800
Are you up for it?
No.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.400
I'm gonna meet yous in Durham.
Why? I've got a surprise.

19:22.467 --> 19:25.533
If Sophie and Nathan and Chloe
are going to work in Durham,

19:25.600 --> 19:27.433
and everyone else is on the
piss,

19:27.500 --> 19:31.767
I'm going to meet everyone there
with
a nice surprise for the last
day.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.767
Right, come on, girls.
Coming.

19:38.833 --> 19:41.400
I can't wait to watch the show.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.733
It's always good to get out of
Newcastle, especially with the
sun.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.667
We've got to Durham, it's rammed
and on the river it's beautiful.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.867
We'll get ready first.
It's very busy.

19:58.933 --> 20:01.667
There's perfect.
We'll go and watch from there.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.533
Go on, then. See you later.
It's absolutely chocka.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.900
I would hate to be wearing
one of them costumes today.

20:07.967 --> 20:10.733
Abbie, make sure you sing.
I want to hear your voice.

20:10.800 --> 20:15.133
Right, just like that. You
actually
look like a fancy dress girl
band.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.167
What about me?
Oh, shit.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.500
# Toon Tours!
We're coming for you

20:20.567 --> 20:22.633
# And I need a fucking poo in
the loo

20:22.700 --> 20:24.400
# And this is my finale.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.200
Good job! Good job!

20:27.467 --> 20:31.000
It is
absolutely fucking boiling
outside,

20:31.067 --> 20:35.000
and me and Abbie have tight
catsuits.
I'm sweating fucking clams here.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.300
What you think we are?

20:39.367 --> 20:42.433
The Tyne Bridge.
(cheering)

20:42.500 --> 20:45.367
I don't know what bridge
everyone's been looking at,

20:45.433 --> 20:47.967
but I don't think
these look anything like it.

20:48.033 --> 20:51.167
(Marnie) What the fuck is that?
Where's the middle bit?

20:51.233 --> 20:54.233
Watching them all making
a fucking tit of themselves,

20:54.300 --> 20:56.000
I'm so pleased that isn't me.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.000
Seeing as though we're here
alone,

20:58.067 --> 21:01.200
might as well take this
opportunity
to do a bit of role play.

21:01.267 --> 21:04.667
While the others are at work,
I've got Marnie and Aaron to
myself.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.700
I think I've got a plan in mind
that might help.

21:08.533 --> 21:11.000
The important thing about this
is we listen.

21:11.067 --> 21:13.500
Yeah. Marnie,
you say what you want to say.

21:13.567 --> 21:17.367
Aaron, you listen, you wait, you
don't reply until I tell you to.
Go.

21:17.433 --> 21:20.833
I'm not really into counselling,
but I may as well give it a go.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.567
The last day,
what's the worst that can
happen?

21:23.633 --> 21:27.900
I find that as soon as I try
and get my point across to
Aaron,

21:27.967 --> 21:32.500
he doesn't register it, and he
just
turns it all back round onto me.

21:32.567 --> 21:35.933
Aaron, how do you feel about
that?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.333
(laughs) Say that again.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.167
For some reason
Nathan wants to play counsellor,

21:41.233 --> 21:44.000
so me and Marnie
can get everything off our
chests.

21:44.067 --> 21:45.700
This is gonna end in tears.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.367
Think first then speak.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.367
I hate being in the wrong.

21:50.433 --> 21:52.167
I fucking hate it.

21:52.233 --> 21:55.600
What the hell, Nathan?
You're getting Aaron to be
honest.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.300
Maybe this whole counselling
idea
isn't so bad.

21:58.367 --> 22:01.200
Why now... do you admit that?
Cos Nathan's here.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.967
Nathan's here for back-up.

22:03.033 --> 22:05.400
You have to get a counsellor
to admit that?

22:05.467 --> 22:08.067
So far, this is going amazing.

22:08.133 --> 22:10.633
They're actually listening
to each other speak.

22:10.700 --> 22:13.033
God, this is perfect!

22:13.100 --> 22:15.967
Am I second best to your life?

22:16.033 --> 22:18.500
No. Am I second best to your
life?

22:18.567 --> 22:19.600
No. Because I...

22:19.667 --> 22:24.033
I tried to give it a go with you
before I got in a relationship.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.867
You didn't though.
I'm not going to get into this.

22:26.933 --> 22:28.767
I'm not going to dwell on the
past.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.000
The past is why
I've got trust issues now.

22:31.067 --> 22:33.167
Aaron hates talking about the
past,

22:33.233 --> 22:35.800
but if it wasn't for the way
he treated us then,

22:35.867 --> 22:39.500
I wouldn't be scared to commit
now.
He's only got himself to blame.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.667
I'm just scared
of getting hurt again.

22:41.733 --> 22:43.533
I'm asking you what you want.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.867
You fucking mugged me off, man.
Shut up.

22:45.933 --> 22:47.500
Fucking shut up.
You did.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.400
You always play the victim.
You do.

22:49.467 --> 22:52.967
Right, listen. Listen...
You didn't treat us nice.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.933
You called us a cunt
every time you drank.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.267
You fucking turned into
one. You left us.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.967
Well, obviously,
because you called us a cunt.

23:01.033 --> 23:04.867
Oh, shit! I don't think
I'm qualified for this.

23:04.933 --> 23:07.600
Right now, I fucking hate men.

23:07.667 --> 23:09.900
I hate you and I hate you.

23:09.967 --> 23:12.733
I'm just the counsellor.
I'm not in a relationship.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.800
Fucking hell, me and Marnie are
having an argument through
Nathan.

23:16.867 --> 23:18.733
(they talk over each other)

23:18.800 --> 23:21.667
Let's talk about now.
Can't change what happened.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.500
Can I just...
No!

23:23.567 --> 23:25.500
Listen!
See? She's getting angry.

23:25.567 --> 23:28.033
You can't speak to her.
This is why I'm here.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.700
I think these two
actually forgot I'm here.

23:30.767 --> 23:33.767
Because they sat there
arguing amongst themselves.

23:33.833 --> 23:34.833
Awkward.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.800
Get off us, man! Get off us.
Oh, fuck off, man.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.567
You fuck off!
Fucking divvy!

23:39.633 --> 23:41.667
I'll smash his fucking head in.

23:41.733 --> 23:44.467
I mean... that went well(!)

23:46.400 --> 23:47.533
(cheering)

23:47.600 --> 23:49.933
It's our last night.
It's gonna be a belter.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.467
(Gary) Aaron could be back on
track.
(cheering)

23:54.533 --> 23:56.400
I think I'm actually gonna
faint.

23:57.467 --> 23:59.733
(groaning)
What better way to end the night

23:59.800 --> 24:01.800
than some make-up sex?
(giggling)

24:01.867 --> 24:03.833
Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:06.467 --> 24:06.667
.

24:09.200 --> 24:09.400
.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.433
Hi.
Hello.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.367
We fucking nailed work.
I'm dying for a drink, like.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.033
I got through the job.
That's what matters.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.267
I would have much rather
been with you.

24:30.333 --> 24:33.300
I don't think so.
Me and Aaron ended up arguing
again.

24:33.367 --> 24:34.933
Why? What over?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.133
We weren't arguing.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.600
Nathan was having to be the
mediator,
like a counsellor.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.467
I haven't got a clue
what's been going on,

24:42.533 --> 24:44.800
but it sounds like
it's been kicking off

24:44.867 --> 24:47.000
and Nathan has been Jeremy Kyle.

24:47.067 --> 24:50.067
He seems to have it in his head
that it's just easy for me

24:50.133 --> 24:53.467
to come in and get with him,
and then go out and do my own
thing.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.833
But that's not the case.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.733
"I tried my hardest
to be with you last year,

24:57.800 --> 25:00.067
and it was you
who wouldn't commit to me."

25:00.133 --> 25:01.833
I used to think Aaron loved us,

25:01.900 --> 25:04.533
but sometimes I think now
you can't be horrible

25:04.600 --> 25:07.300
and say horrible things
to someone you care about.

25:07.367 --> 25:10.200
I don't think he is ready
to give it a go. Nah.

25:10.267 --> 25:12.933
If you said to him,
"Let's get in a relationship,"

25:13.000 --> 25:14.667
I don't think he'd say yes.
Yeah.

25:14.733 --> 25:18.367
I love Maron together, but I
don't
think it's the right time for
them

25:18.433 --> 25:21.967
to be in a relationship.
All they're doing is arguing.

25:22.033 --> 25:24.900
Marnie, I'm not being funny
but your top says it all.

25:24.967 --> 25:26.400
(laughs)

25:26.467 --> 25:27.667
That's what I say.

25:27.733 --> 25:29.733
Dump the lot of them.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.067
The honeymoon period
is now over with us.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.900
I just hope we can sort things
out

25:33.967 --> 25:36.333
and become friends again
before we leave.

25:38.967 --> 25:41.233
Hello, guys.
Hi.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.033
I'm just getting the chives
out of Nathan's teeth.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.133
Has anyone heard from Gaz?
Where the fuck is he?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.833
Gary hasn't been with us today

25:48.900 --> 25:50.900
and we wondered
where the fuck is he?

25:51.733 --> 25:53.267
(Nathan) Oh, here he comes!

25:53.333 --> 25:56.767
Finally he rocks up and he's got
something massive in his hand.

25:56.833 --> 25:58.300
What the hell?

25:58.367 --> 26:00.000
Here it is.
(cheering)

26:01.000 --> 26:03.900
I cannot wait for them
to see my surprise!

26:03.967 --> 26:06.900
Do yous like it?

26:06.967 --> 26:09.867
Gary, you could have picked
a better picture, man!

26:09.933 --> 26:11.100
Aw!

26:11.167 --> 26:12.500
Do you like it?
I love it!

26:12.567 --> 26:15.533
"Sometimes fighting,
always loving, family!"

26:15.600 --> 26:17.300
That's actually a nice photo.

26:17.367 --> 26:21.133
This goes to show that Gary
actually
does have a nice little heart.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.133
The reason I picked that
picture,

26:23.200 --> 26:25.467
that was one of the best trips
we've had.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.767
I actually really can't wait
to get back and get out tonight.

26:28.833 --> 26:31.033
It's going to be a fucking good
one!

26:31.100 --> 26:34.900
Minus Aaron and Marnie's
fall-out,
today's actually been wicked.

26:34.967 --> 26:39.700
I just hope we can continue the
fun
tonight cos it is the last
night.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.433
(whooping)

26:43.667 --> 26:46.800
Sophie, get off my cock!
Oh, my God, it is hard.

26:50.367 --> 26:53.167
Lads, what do you think
about putting it here?

26:53.233 --> 26:55.233
(cheering)

26:55.300 --> 26:56.633
Perfect.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.233
(cheering, applause)

26:59.567 --> 27:02.100
Right, I want to be in
that mood again tonight.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.400
It's our last night,
let's go out with...

27:04.467 --> 27:08.600
Honestly, let's have the best
night
ever! (cheering) Go, go, go!

27:08.667 --> 27:10.800
Tonight
is gonna be better than Rome.

27:10.867 --> 27:12.767
Who needs old buildings and
pasta,

27:12.833 --> 27:17.000
when you've got the Tyne Bridge
and fucking kebabs? Come on!

27:20.200 --> 27:23.400
I can see your willy.
If you get a hard-on, I'm
leaving.

27:23.467 --> 27:24.833
(laughs sarcastically)

27:33.133 --> 27:34.267
(all) Cheers.

27:34.333 --> 27:37.833
Tonight is our last night and
because we've had such a good
time,

27:37.900 --> 27:40.733
I don't want any drama with
me and Aaron to ruin it.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.800
Tonight we're going out with a
bang.

27:42.867 --> 27:45.300
(cheering)

27:48.133 --> 27:49.533
(Nathan) Last night!

27:57.567 --> 27:59.833
The club's bouncing,
it's our last night,

27:59.900 --> 28:01.433
it's gonna be a pure belter!

28:12.533 --> 28:13.767
Chloe!

28:22.400 --> 28:26.100
I'm so happy I didn't lose my
most
important friendship in this
house.

28:26.167 --> 28:28.400
Me and Nathan
are even closer than ever,

28:28.467 --> 28:31.300
and I want him to know
exactly how much I care for him.

28:36.667 --> 28:40.800
There has been a rocky road for
us,
but we've put our differences
aside,

28:40.867 --> 28:44.133
we're reflecting on the past
and we know we've been stupid.

28:49.267 --> 28:50.667
Yeah!

28:56.000 --> 28:59.700
Aaron, talk to Marnie. I know
you don't want to but you have
to,

28:59.767 --> 29:01.700
because it's the last night.

29:18.033 --> 29:21.867
Mine and Marnie's relationship,
or
whatever it is, means so much to
us.

29:21.933 --> 29:23.667
And we have to get it sorted
now.

29:45.467 --> 29:48.200
This is everything
I've ever wanted from Aaron.

29:48.267 --> 29:51.267
He's taking responsibility,
speaking from the heart

29:51.333 --> 29:54.767
and he's being serious. It's the
best apology I've ever heard.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.600
I'm keeping a close eye
on Marnie and Aaron.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.700
So far, so good.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.100
I'm so happy that we've made up.

30:22.167 --> 30:24.433
But why didn't he say all this
last year?

30:24.500 --> 30:27.867
I was ready. And I'm not now.
Aaron needs to understand that.

30:30.667 --> 30:34.300
There's been no drinks thrown,
no tears, nobody's stormed off.

30:34.367 --> 30:38.367
I don't want to tempt fate but I
think Maron could be back on
track.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.133
I'm not sure where
this leaves me and Marns.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.667
I'm just glad to be back
to how we were before.

30:47.733 --> 30:50.733
I'm not gonna push it.
I just wanna have a good night.

30:54.133 --> 30:58.167
Yes! This is it. It's our last
night,
it's absolutely epic.

31:10.767 --> 31:14.400
With Scottie I was so down
and I always felt shit about
myself.

31:14.467 --> 31:18.367
But with Gary I feel like he's
really helped boost my
confidence.

31:22.867 --> 31:25.600
I'm pleased we didn't
take things to the next level.

31:25.667 --> 31:28.500
I feel if we had it would have
made things complicated.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.067
(laughs)
We're really good friends.

31:34.133 --> 31:36.900
But I can't rule out
a harmless flirt in the future.

31:52.633 --> 31:56.133
I'm so gutted it's the last
night,
but we have ended it on a high.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.667
No one has fell out.
We're all friends again.

32:02.867 --> 32:05.600
The night's come to an end
and Chloe's got an idea.

32:05.667 --> 32:08.133
She wants us all
to go to a kebab shop.

32:08.200 --> 32:12.300
I'm not gonna lie, I can't
fucking
wait cos I'm absolutely
starving.

32:12.367 --> 32:14.733
(they chant "kebab" repeatedly)

32:19.400 --> 32:22.600
We get to the kebab shop
and things go mental pretty
quick!

32:22.667 --> 32:25.333
I don't know why
we are not just normal.

32:26.667 --> 32:29.000
I will! Me!
Be careful.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.600
(chanting) Spray it like it's
cum!
Spray it like it's cum!

32:33.667 --> 32:35.167
(cheering)

32:36.267 --> 32:40.233
Chloe got more garlic sauce
in her hair than in my food!

32:40.300 --> 32:41.400
She is shit.

32:41.467 --> 32:46.300
Right, I wanna see if you can
fit
a whole pizza in your mouth.
Right?

32:46.367 --> 32:50.133
It wouldn't be the last night
without another challenge for
Nathan.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.233
Nathan, a whole pizza in your
mouth.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.833
It's a bad idea.
No, no, he's all right.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.633
Nathan can fit 18 chicken
nuggets
in his mouth.

32:59.700 --> 33:04.133
But can you fit a margherita
pizza
in that fucking big mouth of
yours?

33:04.200 --> 33:05.233
Oh, my God!

33:05.300 --> 33:06.967
(chanting) Nathan! Nathan!

33:07.033 --> 33:08.167
One more slice!

33:08.233 --> 33:10.267
I feel sick
with what I've just seen.

33:10.333 --> 33:12.367
I think I'm actually gonna
faint.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.900
(cheering)

33:18.167 --> 33:20.900
That's ten whole inches in my
mouth.

33:20.967 --> 33:23.867
God, my mother would be so
proud!

33:23.933 --> 33:26.300
I think we're ready to go home
now.

33:26.367 --> 33:28.233
I'm stuffed and I stink of
garlic.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.767
I need to get home
so I can have a lie-down.

33:37.067 --> 33:40.033
I've checked out,
I'm not gonna fucking lie!

33:40.100 --> 33:42.000
(Abbie) I had the best night
ever.

33:42.067 --> 33:45.033
There was no kick-offs
and everyone had loads of fun.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.533
It makes me even more gutted
to have to leave.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.733
Slumber party!
(cheering)

33:50.800 --> 33:52.367
Howay, then.
(indistinct)

33:52.433 --> 33:55.333
I don't want to the party to
stop,
so I want everyone

33:55.400 --> 33:58.867
to pull their mattress in
the girls' room for a slumber
party.

34:05.267 --> 34:08.333
We get back and decide
there's only one thing left to
do.

34:08.400 --> 34:09.933
That is all sleep together.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.333
But Sophie's fell asleep on the
sofa.
I am not having that.

34:14.900 --> 34:18.033
(Chloe)
I can't find my fucking eyelash!

34:20.333 --> 34:22.699
I'm so glad that me and Marns
have made up,

34:22.766 --> 34:26.733
and what better way to spend our
last night than together in bed?

34:30.333 --> 34:32.632
Night, Nathan.
Night, Sophie.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.400
Night, Gary.
Night, Chloe.

34:34.467 --> 34:36.300
(Chloe) Night, everyone.

34:36.367 --> 34:37.766
Me and Aaron have made up,

34:37.833 --> 34:41.033
so what better way to end the
night
than some make-up sex?

34:42.833 --> 34:44.233
I'm trying to go to sleep,

34:44.300 --> 34:46.400
but all I can hear
is clop-clop-clop.

34:46.467 --> 34:49.300
Chloe just said you were
fingering.
(Marnie) Who?!

34:49.367 --> 34:50.500
I heard fingering.

34:50.567 --> 34:53.500
How would you hear fingering?
(imitates fingering)

34:53.567 --> 34:54.833
That was kissing, man!

34:54.900 --> 34:58.267
Urgh! Are you gonna shag him,
then?
You bunch of fucking nuns!

34:58.333 --> 34:59.467
(giggles)

34:59.533 --> 35:02.033
If that's the kinky shit
they get up to in here,

35:02.100 --> 35:04.333
I wonder what they're gonna do
next door.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.900
(moans)

35:07.000 --> 35:10.567
Chloe can be a bit of a perv
but she's rubbing off on me,

35:10.633 --> 35:13.267
so we're gonna spy on
Marnie and Aaron shagging.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.900
(giggling)

35:21.033 --> 35:22.367
Love yous.
Bye, Abbie.

35:22.433 --> 35:25.700
All right, all right. This time
I'm a proper family member.

35:25.767 --> 35:26.900
To the oldies.

35:26.967 --> 35:28.633
I just love it!

35:28.700 --> 35:31.733
I'll never give up faith on
Maron.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.600
We're soulmates.
No one can take that away from
us.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:39.967 --> 35:40.167
.

35:42.667 --> 35:42.867
.

35:56.133 --> 36:00.267
(Chloe) Well, good morning!
Rise and shine, my camper
friends!

36:00.333 --> 36:04.633
A whole fucking pizza in my
mouth!

36:04.700 --> 36:06.900
You fit a slice of pizza
in your top lip.

36:06.967 --> 36:09.567
Well, it's the wonders of
filler.

36:09.633 --> 36:14.133
(Sophie) Everyone was having a
laugh,
Aaron and Marnie made up.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.933
They can't stay away
from each other for too long.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.200
I think Aaron and Marnie
are meant to be.

36:19.267 --> 36:20.733
They do have up and downs,

36:20.800 --> 36:23.600
but there's a reason
they're meant to be together.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.733
I personally can't wait
to buy a hat for the wedding
day!

36:28.367 --> 36:30.767
Well, I wasn't expecting
to wake up in here.

36:30.833 --> 36:34.433
That's just what happens when
we're best friends with
benefits.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.500
(they laugh)

36:35.567 --> 36:38.000
After yesterday,
I just can't believe

36:38.067 --> 36:40.700
me and Aaron are back here,
waking up together.

36:40.767 --> 36:42.433
Some things never change.

36:42.500 --> 36:46.633
The nicest, most beautiful
speech
I've ever heard. (laughs)

36:46.700 --> 36:48.367
It wasn't a speech!

36:49.433 --> 36:52.633
Whatever it was, it was great.
Thought I'd get things off my
chest.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.933
I still can't get over
how lovely Aaron was last night.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.067
He finally owned up
and took some responsibility

36:59.133 --> 37:01.000
for why we've never worked out.

37:01.067 --> 37:03.300
I'm just so pleased that,
like...

37:03.367 --> 37:07.067
how I much I wanted you to just
be
honest and open about how you
feel.

37:07.133 --> 37:10.400
Last night you finally were,
and that's all I wanted,

37:10.467 --> 37:12.533
so I'm so happy and grateful.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.833
Thank you.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.867
It sounds like last night
I said all the right things,

37:16.933 --> 37:19.567
so, Marns, does this mean
we can be together now?

37:19.633 --> 37:22.167
I think you should
make the breakfast.

37:22.233 --> 37:24.833
(Nathan) I think
we should get ready and pack.

37:29.233 --> 37:31.933
(Chloe) This time round
has been so brilliant.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.867
Now we need to pack, pronto!

37:37.067 --> 37:38.567
Oh, a fiver!

37:40.667 --> 37:43.667
I can't believe
it's time to go home so soon.

37:43.733 --> 37:46.533
I am gonna really miss
my Geordie family.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.100
What about this?
A lot of memories with this.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.700
That is disgusting,
it's still got crust on it.

37:51.767 --> 37:54.233
Which one of yous
has actually used that?

37:54.300 --> 37:56.200
All of us.
I haven't.

37:56.267 --> 37:59.500
I haven't. I went to use it
and the batteries ran out on us.

38:01.467 --> 38:04.000
Behind you!
Go, go, go, go, go!

38:09.567 --> 38:12.467
Before we leave
we've got one thing we need to
do,

38:12.533 --> 38:15.067
check on the ducks,
Skinny and Squeaky.

38:15.133 --> 38:17.500
Just wanna say bye,
Skinny and Squeaky.

38:17.567 --> 38:20.267
I never thought
I'd get to live with a duck.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.100
Bye, Squeaky and Skinny.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.967
I have loved being your mam,
but your wicked stepmother Anna

38:26.033 --> 38:29.333
is gonna be here soon
to take you to a loving home.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.100
Cheers for the eggs!

38:33.433 --> 38:36.433
Right, well, me and Nathan's
gotta catch a bus.

38:36.500 --> 38:40.200
I can't drive, she can't drive,
so we're going to get the bus.

38:40.267 --> 38:42.067
Love yous. Bye, Abbie.

38:42.133 --> 38:43.933
Bye, Nath.
Bye, baby girl.

38:45.733 --> 38:48.233
This is it,
this is time to say goodbye.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.900
I don't know why I get this
emotional
cos we all live in Newcastle.

38:50.967 --> 38:52.567
all around the corner
from each other.

38:52.633 --> 38:54.533
Do you want to have a race?
Yeah.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.733
Nathan, wait for me!

39:00.800 --> 39:02.433
It's all right, darling.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.767
It's so emotional,
leaving this house.

39:04.833 --> 39:06.833
Last time I was just a newbie.

39:06.900 --> 39:11.000
But this time I'm a proper
family member, so it's happy
tears.

39:11.067 --> 39:13.433
Right, kiss.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.833
Not on the lips!

39:14.900 --> 39:18.233
Ah! Went in there! In for the
kill.
Right, get in the car, Nanna.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.733
See you later.
Bye, darling.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.867
How embarrassing are you, Nanna?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.167
(cries)

39:27.233 --> 39:30.533
I've seen you go through
such a horrible time.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.800
Aaron, if it wasn't for you,
she's been so happy

39:33.867 --> 39:35.433
and you've helped that as well.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.933
I'm crying like a divvy!

39:37.000 --> 39:39.867
It means the world to us
to see Marnie happy.

39:39.933 --> 39:42.600
And Aaron is the one to thank
for that.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.333
To the oldies!
(laughter)

39:44.400 --> 39:48.233
I'm really going to miss that
house.
You miss everything about it.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.767
And I can't wait to come back!

39:51.867 --> 39:53.233
(horn honks)

39:53.300 --> 39:55.900
I've had the best time
I've had here in a long time.

39:55.967 --> 39:58.800
I came in newly single,
a little bit confused,

39:58.867 --> 40:03.000
and I'm leaving fresh and I feel
like
I've got a new lease of life.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.433
And, yous two,
try going on a fucking date.

40:07.300 --> 40:10.500
It is wicked having Gaz in here.
We're like brothers.

40:10.567 --> 40:13.233
We don't argue
and if I'm in the wrong he tells
us.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.667
That's why I fucking love that
kid.

40:19.500 --> 40:24.267
Listen... I do think we're
soulmates, in a... in a certain
way.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.867
So, what does that mean,
in the long run?

40:26.933 --> 40:31.033
I'll never, ever, ever
give up faith on Maron.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.167
Me and Aaron have history
together.

40:33.233 --> 40:35.633
That can bring us together
or tear us apart.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.800
But we're soulmates and no one
can take that away from us.

40:38.867 --> 40:42.967
One day we'll put all
differences
aside and it will just... work.

40:43.867 --> 40:45.933
Well, hopefully. Give us a
cuddle.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
I come in this house
with Marnie as one of my best
mates.

40:49.067 --> 40:51.233
Every day
we got stronger and stronger.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.433
Now I'm leaving,
I'm hoping something will
happen.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.933
You never know, next time we
might
be boyfriend and girlfriend.

40:58.933 --> 41:00.900
If you wanted a lift
you'd be fucked.

41:00.967 --> 41:02.467
Give us a cuddle.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.033
Bye. Don't go too fast!

41:07.333 --> 41:11.067
Right, I said not too fast!

41:11.133 --> 41:12.367
(cackles)

41:12.433 --> 41:14.767
Everyone gets so emotional
leaving,

41:14.833 --> 41:16.800
but I don't think
it needs to be sad.

41:16.867 --> 41:19.667
I feel so happy,
the happiest I've ever felt.

41:19.733 --> 41:21.633
I just can't wait to get back
in!

41:31.833 --> 41:34.133
Who wants to come to Newcastle?

41:34.200 --> 41:38.733
(shouting, cheering)

41:38.800 --> 41:40.200
Bring... it... on!

41:42.033 --> 41:44.400
I haven't even shaved my minge.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.400
Go on!

41:49.433 --> 41:50.800
Have you missed me?

41:50.867 --> 41:54.033
(cheering)
All I wanna do is get the job
done.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.433
Go on, Aaron!

41:56.500 --> 41:57.833
(cheering)

41:57.900 --> 41:58.967
He has won!

41:59.033 --> 42:01.300
(cheering)

42:03.700 --> 42:04.700
What the hell?

42:08.900 --> 42:12.333
Scotty and Marty
won't be retuning to the house.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.633
Ah, shite!

42:15.700 --> 42:19.233
This is mine and Marnie's
first proper date.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.033
You are like my best friend.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.600
Best friend
who puts his willy in your
mouth!

42:23.667 --> 42:26.500
Let's make Rome pure radge!

42:30.200 --> 42:31.267
When in Rome...

42:31.333 --> 42:34.300
Oh, my God! What is that?

42:34.367 --> 42:36.067
I'm scarred for life.

42:36.133 --> 42:37.433
Go on, Nathan!

42:37.500 --> 42:40.067
(chanting, shouting)

42:40.133 --> 42:41.267
Yes!

42:42.533 --> 42:43.933
What the fuck, man?

42:47.167 --> 42:49.933
Everyone is on a fucking whitie.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.200
Oh, what the fuck was that?

42:54.267 --> 42:56.633
I'm not joking. I need an
ambulance.

42:56.700 --> 42:59.800
What cures a hangover, ladies?
Cock!

43:02.267 --> 43:05.200
I swear to God it was just a
finger.
(imitates fingering)

43:05.267 --> 43:06.633
House party!

43:06.700 --> 43:09.300
(cheering, laughter)

43:13.333 --> 43:15.267
We're friends with benefits.

43:18.267 --> 43:20.300
I fucked her off
and she fucked me off.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.533
You're an
attention-seeking little twat!

43:24.600 --> 43:26.333
(clattering)

43:26.400 --> 43:27.900
(yells)

43:27.967 --> 43:30.533
(sniffs) I've got snot on my
nose.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.567
You're annoying but I love you.
Are we friends? Yeah.

43:33.633 --> 43:36.000
I'm really gonna miss these
radgies.

43:38.267 --> 43:40.300
We have arguments
and then we make up.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.567
We're a family,
brothers and sisters.

43:42.633 --> 43:43.833
That's just how it is.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.533
(Nathan)

44:15.867 --> 44:16.067
.
