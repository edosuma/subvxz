00:20.480 --> 00:21.480
Lunch, Melissa.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.600
-Parth, I just got your email.
<i>-</i> <i>Mr. Price, I need your--</i>

00:25.680 --> 00:29.360
No, I do not agree
with this analysis of the situation.

00:29.440 --> 00:32.360
-The developer has set a timetable.
<i>-Well, that timetable isn't--</i>

00:32.440 --> 00:35.440
And we will be sticking to that timetable,
come hell or high water.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.880
<i>Mr. Price,</i>
<i>the schedule in our agreement...</i>

00:40.120 --> 00:43.200
Parth, you're wasting
your breath, and my time.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.840
<i>There's been unexpected delays.</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:46.840
Redraft the email.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.560
And a flat white, please, extra warm.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.000
And a flat white, please, extra warm.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.520
-Everything okay?
-Sorry?

01:17.960 --> 01:19.040
Nothing. Forget it.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.960
Thank you.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.600
Thank you.

01:32.080 --> 01:32.960
May I?

01:35.680 --> 01:36.960
I'd rather you didn't.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.400
-Okay, so, you know what? I'll just--
-I know all about you.

01:48.680 --> 01:49.760
Meaning?

01:51.560 --> 01:53.400
You're what they used to call
a "ladies man."

01:53.480 --> 01:55.840
-A shagger, likes to put it about.
-Christ.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.840
Sit down, Mr. Price.

01:57.920 --> 01:58.960
You'll wanna hear this.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.480
The affairs you've had over the years...

02:08.520 --> 02:09.880
it's caused a lot of pain.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.280
-A lot of unhappiness.
-Who are you?

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
Just someone who knows.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.000
Yeah.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.360
-Who sent you?
-No one.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.920
No one? Oh, because I don't know you,
you certainly don't know me.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.240
I know enough.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.320
What do you want?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Nothing.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.920
Then I think we're done here.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
You have a child.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.880
-From one of your many affairs.

02:39.680 --> 02:40.720
What?

02:40.800 --> 02:41.960
I have proof.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.880
It's a baby.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.600
-Could be anyone's.
-It's yours.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
Mm-hmm.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.720
With whom? With which woman?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.320
So many, you can't remember.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.080
If you're looking for money,
you're gonna have to do better than that.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.760
Who is it? Is it a boy or a girl?

03:05.320 --> 03:07.120
I'm gonna have to meet this child.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.520
Wait!

03:35.560 --> 03:37.960
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:38.040 --> 03:40.600
<i>♪ Danger knocking at my door ♪</i>

03:41.080 --> 03:43.480
<i>♪ Don't come 'round here no more ♪</i>

03:43.720 --> 03:46.080
<i>♪ I check the locks</i>
<i>Shut the windows down ♪</i>

03:46.160 --> 03:49.120
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

03:57.440 --> 03:59.840
<i>♪ This monster's back in town ♪</i>

04:26.520 --> 04:27.640
Johanna?

05:00.080 --> 05:01.520
<i>Hi, this is Phillip.</i>

05:01.840 --> 05:03.600
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

05:05.680 --> 05:08.320
Shit, shit, shit.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.360
I'm fine! I'm fine!

05:15.160 --> 05:16.840
I need to be on this case.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.240
Don't tell them I know her.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.160
Okay.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.520
Shit! Shit! Shit!

05:22.600 --> 05:25.200
I showed Katz a photograph
of us on holiday.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.880
It's okay. I'll speak to him.
You won't say anything, all right?

05:45.280 --> 05:46.320
I'll get it!

05:48.840 --> 05:50.600
-Hey, mate.
-You lied to me.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.520
-What?
-Why did my wife call you?

05:56.840 --> 05:58.000
I'm just popping out!

06:02.040 --> 06:04.720
Glad to get out, actually.
Cat's been sick, vomiting everywhere.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.440
Too much cheese. Tell 'em over and over,

06:06.520 --> 06:08.040
-"Don't feed it gorgonzola."
-Tripp?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.640
-She called me, yeah.
-Yeah, it lasted three minutes.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.320
You've done your homework.
How'd you know?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.560
Funny response. Checked the phone records.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.400
So why did she call you?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.120
You know why she called me.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.800
The stolen money thing.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.800
Yeah, the stolen money thing.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.440
Wait, no.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.640
The last time we spoke,
you looked me in the eye

06:33.720 --> 06:35.400
and you told me she would never do that.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.320
I lied...

06:36.920 --> 06:39.000
to protect you, as a mate.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.120
So... what did she say?

06:46.240 --> 06:49.800
She said she needed more time. I told her
that she'd done a lot of stalling.

06:49.880 --> 06:50.960
Stalling? What do you mean?

06:51.040 --> 06:53.080
Well, people know
and that she had to confront it.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.280
Why didn't you come to me?
You should've said something.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.600
-Wanna know why I didn't tell you?
-Yeah, I do wanna know!

06:57.680 --> 06:59.160
Because Corinne told me not to.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.480
She didn't want you knowing.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.880
I'm sorry, Adam. She called me.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.880
-She asked for more time.
-Did you give it to her?

07:04.960 --> 07:06.000
-No, I didn't.
-Why?

07:06.080 --> 07:07.600
Because it needed dealing with.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.240
Adam, nobody wants this to be happening.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.200
But let's face it, mate,
she's got herself--

07:14.280 --> 07:16.560
Tripp, just ask yourself,
why would she do this?

07:17.280 --> 07:18.560
We don't need the cash.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.360
Well, not so much
that she'd risk everything.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.680
-She begged me for another week.
-Okay.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.480
She said that she had a way
of proving she was innocent.

07:25.560 --> 07:26.880
-Did you believe her?
-No.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.120
Why could you not just give her
the extra fucking time?

07:48.920 --> 07:51.080
-Mom?
-Oh, hello.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.520
-Uh, Ryan?
-Thomas.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.400
<i>Right.</i>

07:55.480 --> 07:57.440
It's... Granddad.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.360
Hi, Granddad.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.040
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

08:02.120 --> 08:03.760
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.320
<i>Great. How's... tennis?</i>
<i>Do you still play tennis?</i>

08:06.760 --> 08:08.160
It's more... more football, really.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.480
Right, football.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.680
Fantastic.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.080
Um...

08:13.160 --> 08:14.680
I should come and watch you.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.720
<i>Which team is it?</i>

08:21.880 --> 08:23.560
Can you tell by the blood splatter

08:23.640 --> 08:25.800
-how close the killer was stood?
-Close.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.920
<i>-Point blank, really.</i>

08:28.560 --> 08:30.840
Through the knee caps, forehead.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.680
So it could've been someone
known to her.

08:34.080 --> 08:34.920
Or a robbery.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
There's evidence to suggest a robbery.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.280
Forced entry at the rear,
the till's been cleared.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.520
But in contradiction,
she was still wearing her wedding ring,

08:42.600 --> 08:43.760
her phone was still here.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.960
Too many high value items not taken.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.840
We should find out where the husband was.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.800
She's been shot.

08:49.880 --> 08:50.800
So?

08:50.880 --> 08:53.480
I don't see a domestic dispute
being settled with a gun.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.400
Stranger things have happened.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.880
It's not the husband.

08:58.600 --> 08:59.720
It could be anyone.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.720
But best guess is someone
tried to make it look like a robbery.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.160
So she was surprised.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.840
Or she invited them in
and then they produced a weapon.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.400
But who brings a gun to a cake shop?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.160
We need to talk to people
who were here that day,

09:17.240 --> 09:20.680
find out if there were any disagreements,
any problems with anyone.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.200
-Who's looking at CCTV?
-I'll do it.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.120
Okay.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.160
Phone me if it throws light on anything.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.040
I need to go speak to the family.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.160
And ask the husband if he did it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Where's Mom?

09:38.560 --> 09:39.600
I've told you, she's away.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.160
What do you mean, away?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.280
She's at a teacher thing.
Have you boys eaten?

09:43.360 --> 09:45.040
-This is crap.
-Hey.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.160
Teacher thing?
She was just at a teacher thing.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.600
So why isn't she calling us back?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.640
-Are you two splitting up?
-What? No.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.560
-So why were you arguing?
-When?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.800
-The other day, in the garden.
-We have a right to know.

09:54.880 --> 09:56.160
Boys, your mom and I have lives.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.240
Big surprise,
we occasionally yell at one another.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.480
So where is she?

09:59.560 --> 10:01.000
-I told you.
-You're fucking lying!

10:01.080 --> 10:02.800
Hey! Do not use that language
in this house.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.720
Teacher thing? Another city?

10:05.160 --> 10:07.200
So why is her phone two miles away?

10:09.440 --> 10:10.520
How do you know that?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.600
Tracker app from when
you first gave me a phone.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.160
Which you uninstalled.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.000
Mom put it on her phone. It was only fair
I could see where she was.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.320
So she didn't delete it?

10:19.880 --> 10:22.080
-We put it back on my phone, logged in--
-Show me.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.560
So you gonna tell us what happened?

10:26.640 --> 10:27.800
Why she isn't here?

10:28.240 --> 10:29.760
Are you sure this is up to date?

10:29.840 --> 10:30.920
Yeah, I refreshed it.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.160
Ah... I really need to reach her.
Get yourselves some dinner.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.400
-No chance. We're coming.
-I'm gonna take your phone--

10:36.480 --> 10:38.160
Dad, we're coming.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.200
What are you doing here?

10:42.280 --> 10:44.440
Small matter
of my house being knocked down.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.120
You're not answering your phone.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.840
Don't have time. We're off to get Corinne.

10:47.920 --> 10:48.800
Right.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.560
Yeah, she's, uh... just across town.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.560
-Apparently.
-Right.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.160
I'll come with you.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.400
Left here, then half a mile.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.120
I can't go left. It's a no entry.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.720
You got a girlfriend?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.160
No.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.920
Nah, me neither.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.000
They're nothing but trouble.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.480
Last one gave me an ulcer.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.560
By the way, Granddad rang.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.760
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

11:21.840 --> 11:22.720
Says he wants to talk.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.120
Great.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.480
-Hang on. Shit.
-What?

11:27.040 --> 11:29.160
-It's moving, she's going somewhere.
- Where?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.200
-Well, how should I know?
-Which direction?

11:31.280 --> 11:33.400
Wait, speed up, you might catch her. Shit.

11:33.480 --> 11:34.760
It's away from us, towards town.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.680
If she's going this fast,
she must be in a car or a bike.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.880
Whose car is she in?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.960
Uh... Maybe she's getting
a lift or something.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.480
To where?

11:42.560 --> 11:44.200
Town. She's going up the hill
to Ryecroft.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.720
-Ryecroft?
-What about it?

11:45.800 --> 11:47.520
Well, that's a station.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.960
-Yeah, that direction.
-Do you think she's getting a train?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.520
God, I hope not.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.160
-Which platform?
- I don't know.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.520
-Let's each take one.
-Dad, there are five.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.560
Me and Martin will do one and two.
You do three, you do four.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.240
-Anything?
-No. She's not in the café.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.840
Any joy?

12:56.280 --> 12:57.360
Nothing. You?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.480
What does the app say?

12:58.560 --> 12:59.800
Uh...

12:59.880 --> 13:01.440
-No movement.
<i>-So she's here somewhere.</i>

13:01.520 --> 13:02.560
Yeah.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.960
Okay, there's a train on my platform.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.200
It looks like there's one
on platform five.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.800
On my way.

13:09.840 --> 13:10.760
God! Sorry!

13:32.720 --> 13:33.560
Mom?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.720
Looks like she stopped at Harpurton.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.640
What now?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.200
She's not moving.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.800
Why would she get off at Harpurton?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.680
Does she know anyone in Harpurton?

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
Where's Harpurton?

14:55.440 --> 14:56.360
What's the tracker say?

14:56.440 --> 14:58.960
She's not moving.
Look, it's not even streets.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.600
What is that? Fields?

15:00.680 --> 15:02.080
Why would she be in fields?

15:02.160 --> 15:04.120
I'm sure there's some
rational explanation.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.840
Come on, let's go.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
Is she still there?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.160
- Yeah.
- How close?

15:14.240 --> 15:15.480
Top of here, then right.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.520
-Ryan
-Ryan!

15:20.200 --> 15:22.480
Mom? Mom?

15:23.800 --> 15:24.800
She's not here.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.240
It's just a bridge.
It's just a fucking bridge!

15:28.320 --> 15:29.760
Mom!

15:32.160 --> 15:33.280
Well, what's the app say?

15:36.080 --> 15:37.160
Here.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.200
Ryan?

15:49.040 --> 15:49.880
Ryan?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
- Ryan?

15:59.160 --> 16:00.000
Ryan?

16:01.080 --> 16:02.280
Ryan, stop!

16:08.480 --> 16:09.560
It's here.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.120
Why's her phone here?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.120
Oh, God.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.240
She hasn't...

16:19.800 --> 16:20.840
Ryan, no. No, no, no!

16:21.560 --> 16:22.960
Don't even think about it.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.680
-Why is it there, Dad?!
-Listen, there's no reason to think that.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.280
-Look, your mom would never ever do that.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.440
She'd never leave you.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.120
Thomas, tell him.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.560
She wouldn't.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.360
- Why there?
-Somebody probably found the phone

16:38.440 --> 16:40.360
and just dumped it there, okay?

16:40.440 --> 16:41.960
-I don't get it.
-Look...

16:42.480 --> 16:47.120
Look, your mom texted me to say that
she just needed some time to herself.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.520
-Just some time alone, but this...
-Dad, I don't get it.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.160
No. No, she'd never do that.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.600
Come here. It's all right.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
We'll find her.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.280
We'll find her.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.560
Think I should go to the police?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
And say what?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.200
"My wife just asked
for some time to herself

17:18.280 --> 17:19.760
and now she hasn't come home."

17:20.240 --> 17:21.400
The phone on the bridge.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.760
Adam, we were right behind.
We would have seen something.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.280
There's no way.

17:30.000 --> 17:30.880
Unless...

17:31.440 --> 17:32.280
What?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.120
You think she might be trying to fake it?

17:35.200 --> 17:36.400
-Would she do that?
-No.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.160
-No.
-All right.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.480
Well, the next question is...

17:42.200 --> 17:43.360
who put it there?

17:52.920 --> 17:53.920
Hello.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.600
Can I come in, Ian?

18:11.680 --> 18:13.040
How do I tell Kimberley?

18:15.360 --> 18:16.560
How do I do that?

18:18.360 --> 18:19.600
I can help if you like.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.720
And say what?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Murdered?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.400
I mean, it's not an accident, is it?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.200
Not something unavoidable.
Someone wanted to hurt her.

18:33.640 --> 18:34.720
I could, uh...

18:35.480 --> 18:37.400
I should go over. She's at uni.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.160
Maybe I should go over.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.800
Why would anyone do this?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.920
That's...
that's what we've gotta find out.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.480
Um...

19:05.360 --> 19:08.080
Initial thoughts
are some kind of robbery, but...

19:09.320 --> 19:10.640
that might not be correct.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.840
I'm so sorry, Ian.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.800
All I can say is we'll find them, we will.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.200
We'll get the bastard who did this.

20:05.560 --> 20:07.400
<i>Jo, I've just heard. Come home.</i>

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
Hey.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.600
There's tea in the pot.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.600
And I made some scones earlier.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.560
If you're in a scone-y kind of mood.

20:38.680 --> 20:39.760
Oh, and fresh cream.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.520
No point without the cream, is there?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.640
And jam.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.760
Do you want the scone
before or after the hug?

21:01.800 --> 21:03.680
You've lost your closest friend.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.480
But I'm here.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.680
Husband, mate, it doesn't matter.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.480
You're home now.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.520
Let it out.

21:38.080 --> 21:38.960
It's okay.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.360
Don't answer my next statement with...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.280
"I can't."

22:03.560 --> 22:05.320
You're not gonna suggest sex, are you?

22:11.520 --> 22:12.720
Take some time off.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.560
I can't.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.320
I really can't.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.360
Jo, you shouldn't be
anywhere near this case.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.360
You're emotionally invested.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.760
Just go in and tell them...

22:29.320 --> 22:32.120
and ask for a fortnight away.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.800
Jo...

22:39.560 --> 22:40.480
Grieve.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.400
Stay at home.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.760
And grieve.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.760
I can't.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.920
Trust me, there's nothing to this.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.560
So where is she?

23:06.480 --> 23:07.480
I don't know.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.160
She never does this, Dad.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.360
Just...

23:16.960 --> 23:17.920
goes.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.520
Ignores us.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.320
Look, I know you're worried,
but Mom just...

23:25.400 --> 23:26.520
needed some space.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.440
From you.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.240
Not us.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.840
Why isn't she answering our calls?

23:35.400 --> 23:36.840
I don't know.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.280
Come here.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.400
It's here.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.000
<i>Why is her phone here?</i>

24:46.800 --> 24:47.640
Shit.

25:08.000 --> 25:08.840
Hey.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.480
It's been a long while.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.600
It has.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.040
How's things?

25:26.600 --> 25:27.680
Things are fine.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.040
How's work?

25:30.440 --> 25:31.800
Busy. Lots of clients.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.120
You didn't come for small talk.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.440
No.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.840
Beer?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.800
-Lunchtime?
-That never used to stop you.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.480
Okay.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.960
-Thanks.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.720
So...

26:05.080 --> 26:05.920
So...

26:08.480 --> 26:10.200
Look, Adam, you calling was...

26:13.120 --> 26:16.400
I can't really handle a big thing here,
so you wanna just tell me what you want?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.080
Did my wife ever call you?

26:27.760 --> 26:28.840
Yeah, she did.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.320
When?

26:30.920 --> 26:32.400
When do you think? When we were...

26:34.680 --> 26:36.760
A couple of years ago during the case.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.320
You never told me.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.360
No. I wonder why.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.880
Look, what difference does it make?
It's all way back.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.680
What did she say?

26:48.880 --> 26:50.200
She knew you'd been to my house.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.640
Uh, what else?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.600
She wanted to know why you were there.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.440
What did you tell her?

27:01.280 --> 27:02.120
That it was work.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.840
Did she believe you?

27:07.880 --> 27:08.840
What do you think?

27:11.640 --> 27:12.520
But you...

27:13.280 --> 27:14.480
told her it was nothing.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.080
It was nothing.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.560
Professional people get close.
It was a tough case. It happens.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.800
Yeah, you tell yourself that.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.960
What's that supposed to mean?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.080
-For Christ's sake, what am I doing here?
-Sally.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.920
You wanted it as much as I did.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.240
You were standing right on the line.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.840
Teetering.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.120
We could be sitting here now
as a fucking couple, Adam.

27:43.560 --> 27:44.440
And...

27:45.400 --> 27:46.840
we agreed to step back.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.400
Oh, yes, we did.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.160
You were married. It was the right thing.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.320
She contacted me again
a couple of weeks later.

28:01.760 --> 28:04.640
Warned me away, told me
what it would do to her, to your family.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.840
Made me feel like a piece of shit.

28:07.640 --> 28:10.080
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to have a woman,

28:10.160 --> 28:13.080
a mother, ring you
and call you all kinds of homewrecker?

28:16.080 --> 28:18.440
I told her it was all rubbish,
but she knew, Adam.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.360
Women know.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.960
I don't know why you're trawling
all this up, but this was a mistake.

28:26.040 --> 28:26.880
Hey.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.760
You're looking well.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.160
Bye, Adam.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.080
Come on, it'll be good. Another baby.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.360
Remember how happy we were
when we had Tom and Ryan?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.040
It's gone.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.360
I've lost it.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.440
You didn't have to stay
when she told you she was pregnant.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.080
We all have our secrets, Adam.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.480
Even you.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.920
-Hi.
- Hello, sir. How can I help?

30:05.600 --> 30:07.480
I need to report a missing person.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.280
Okay. I just need to take a few details.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.880
Are you okay to speak to me in...

30:21.680 --> 30:23.000
Oh, Johanna.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.360
Right, do you want the weird news
or the really weird news?

30:25.440 --> 30:26.440
Weird news.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.840
CCTV from the café,
day she was murdered, completely wiped.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.040
How do you know wiped,
not just never recorded?

30:32.120 --> 30:35.200
Something to do with aggressive data.
You know how those tech guys talk.

30:35.280 --> 30:37.000
Right, so the murderer wiped it,

30:37.080 --> 30:39.840
which means they have access to the office
or they found her keys.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.680
So we need to fingerprint the keys

30:42.760 --> 30:44.680
and the office
and all of the machines up there.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.600
On it.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.800
Also, check if they've got
any kind of backup system.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.880
-Sometimes they save it to the cloud.
-Double on it.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.920
And then check external cameras.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.760
'Cause there must be
some kind of CCTV nearby.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.440
Hang on.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.120
-What's the really weird news?
-Oh.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.080
I had a ham salad for lunch...

31:00.880 --> 31:02.520
but my fingers smell like fish.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.200
Weird.

31:05.880 --> 31:06.880
Wha...?

31:42.680 --> 31:45.320
Mom came to see me
a few days ago.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.240
On campus.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.480
Right.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.120
My dad didn't though.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.720
Right.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.240
She was...

31:55.600 --> 31:56.480
anxious.

31:57.880 --> 31:58.720
She was...

32:01.760 --> 32:02.640
worried about me.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.280
Worried how I was settling in.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.400
My finances.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.040
What was she worried about that for?

32:14.520 --> 32:15.400
Just...

32:19.840 --> 32:22.320
Why was she planning to fly away with you?
That's so weird.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.080
Not really. We talked about it for years.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.240
Yeah, but why now?

32:30.520 --> 32:32.440
I'm...

32:32.920 --> 32:34.800
planning on retiring and...

32:35.640 --> 32:37.440
-I've left Phillip.
-Yeah, but Mom hadn't.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.600
She had my dad, a business.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.040
She wanted adventure.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.400
Life can be same-y. She just wanted...

32:46.480 --> 32:47.440
What?

32:49.400 --> 32:51.200
-Are you a lesbian?
-I'm sorry?

32:51.280 --> 32:52.360
-Were you and my mom--
-No.

32:52.440 --> 32:53.400
You loved her, right?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.440
Yes.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.360
As a friend, as...

32:59.800 --> 33:00.760
She was special.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.480
I wasn't trying to steal her.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.280
I was unhappy and I needed a change,

33:10.360 --> 33:12.600
and for whatever reason,

33:12.680 --> 33:14.880
your mom wanted to take some time too.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.240
You should look into her finances.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.040
I think she might...

33:33.560 --> 33:35.440
Someone was trying to blackmail her.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.560
Blackmail?

33:40.120 --> 33:41.080
She said...

33:43.360 --> 33:44.680
someone came to see her.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.120
A woman.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.960
I don't know any of the details.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.280
Oh, you're not even up!

34:47.840 --> 34:49.880
Come on! Football! Cup game!

34:49.960 --> 34:51.040
I've gotta pick up Daisy!

34:51.120 --> 34:52.760
Oh, I can't find a clean kit!

34:52.840 --> 34:53.880
Have I got a clean kit?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.440
Mom usually sorts this stuff.

34:56.160 --> 34:58.480
-Why don't you check the linen basket?
-Get up!

34:59.240 --> 35:00.560
Hope they're not dirty.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.760
All right, everybody out.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.200
Thank you, Mr. Price.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.600
You okay?

35:13.680 --> 35:14.520
Yeah.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.520
Go on.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.960
I think my dad's
keeping something from me.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.880
He and Mom had a fight.
He's not telling me something.

35:25.960 --> 35:27.040
Like what?

35:29.200 --> 35:31.960
Don't know. It's like
she abandoned her whole family.

35:32.040 --> 35:32.920
Hey.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.440
Come on.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.920
It's gonna be okay.

35:38.080 --> 35:41.080
My mom and dad went through it all,
and it works itself out.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.000
-Kind of.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.520
Hey, Liv.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.240
-Hey.
- You okay?

35:49.320 --> 35:50.360
Not really.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.800
Got these terrible cramps,
but hopefully the fresh air will help.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.760
-I came to see Mike.
-Why?

35:56.080 --> 35:57.200
He got arrested.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.720
Well, I know, but--

35:58.800 --> 36:00.120
It's so weird, isn't it?

36:00.200 --> 36:01.080
That night.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.440
What happened with Dante,
the alpaca head.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.040
Do you think it was all him?

36:05.120 --> 36:07.360
Something seriously strange has gone down.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.200
How's Ella?

36:09.720 --> 36:10.960
Yep, she's good.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.280
Poor girl.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.200
Anyway, back on planet Earth.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.920
I'm sure someone knows the truth
about all this.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.640
It'll come out. It always does.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.400
We need to talk to Mike.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.320
Half time.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.120
Come on!

36:35.000 --> 36:35.960
Well done, mate.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.240
Going for glory.
There's no shame in that.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.360
Hi, Ryan.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.880
You might not remember him.
This is your granddad.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.160
Hi, Grandpa.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.520
I came to see the boy play.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.600
The boy?

36:52.680 --> 36:53.640
Thomas.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.720
He told me he had a match when I called.
I did ask for you to call me back.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.880
Yeah, well, been a bit busy.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.440
You're trying to keep insane old men
in houses marked for demolition?

37:03.520 --> 37:05.960
-If you've come to my son's match to--
-I haven't.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.160
Well, what have you come for then, really?

37:10.120 --> 37:11.040
Can I buy you a coffee?

37:11.120 --> 37:12.640
I'm watching the football.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.840
In the interval.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.560
The... halftime.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.120
Okay.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.280
Lose the baseball cap.

37:24.680 --> 37:26.080
Ooh...

37:29.560 --> 37:33.120
So, I don't want to be overly dramatic
about this, Adam.

37:33.200 --> 37:34.200
Uh...

37:35.000 --> 37:36.040
I've had some...

37:36.720 --> 37:38.960
something of a Damascene conversion.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.120
Damascene?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.160
-From Saint Paul--
-I know what it is.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.480
Something happened recently
that made me reflect.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.400
-Wow, reflect?
-Mmm.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.360
Reflect.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.520
How did that make you feel,

37:53.600 --> 37:56.200
experiencing such a new emotion?

38:00.560 --> 38:01.400
What happened?

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
Doesn't matter what.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.280
Piss off, "Damascene conversion."
What happened?

38:07.640 --> 38:10.040
There was this, um...

38:11.600 --> 38:13.400
this encounter, and...

38:14.520 --> 38:15.760
something from my...

38:16.440 --> 38:18.440
Look. The point is...

38:19.920 --> 38:22.880
I was a poor father, and...
and an even worse grandfather.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.760
Absent. I...

38:25.680 --> 38:26.720
Driven by...

38:27.200 --> 38:28.880
-other factors over the years.
-Your dick.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.080
-Other factors.
-Your dick.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.360
Look, Adam...

38:32.720 --> 38:34.440
All right, sometimes my dick.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.280
I can't turn things around,
I can't turn back the clock.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.720
Do I wish I'd treated your mother better?

38:41.800 --> 38:43.560
Yes. Do I wish I'd been...

38:44.280 --> 38:46.320
more paternal to you
when you were younger?

38:46.800 --> 38:48.480
Emphatically, yes.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.840
The only way I can change things
is from this day forward, I...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.120
I wanna make amends.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.160
I wanna be a bigger part
of your life, of the boys' lives.

38:59.720 --> 39:00.880
I want...

39:03.000 --> 39:04.760
You think I'm full of shit, don't you?

39:05.680 --> 39:06.880
-No.
-Well, then what?

39:08.400 --> 39:11.320
All this shit you create for yourself...

39:12.600 --> 39:13.600
who you are...

39:15.400 --> 39:16.920
I've had to fight against that...

39:17.800 --> 39:19.720
against becoming you.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.200
Passing it on to my boys.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.440
I haven't always succeeded.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.440
I'm sorry.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.520
-Soon as you get that ball...
- What do they know?

39:42.600 --> 39:44.080
Nothing. <i>Nada.</i>

39:45.360 --> 39:46.920
Did they ask who organized the rave?

39:47.560 --> 39:50.280
I told them Adam Pueman.

39:52.040 --> 39:52.960
Huh?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.280
It's an anagram of "made up name."

39:57.000 --> 39:57.840
You serious?

39:57.920 --> 40:00.000
You lied to the police?
They know there were dealers.

40:00.080 --> 40:00.920
Tom...

40:01.440 --> 40:03.920
all they give a shit about is Dante.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.680
If he dies, it's a fucking murder inquiry.

40:07.760 --> 40:09.960
So who organized the rave,

40:10.040 --> 40:13.160
and who were dealing,
are not their main concern.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.320
Thomas, second half!

40:15.160 --> 40:16.200
What are you three doing?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.800
I'm measuring their dicks
to put an end to an argument.

40:22.800 --> 40:24.960
Adam Pueman. Fuck's sake.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.240
- Olivia!

40:26.320 --> 40:27.280
Shit, it's Olivia.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.560
-You okay?
-What's happened to her?

40:30.640 --> 40:31.480
Liv!

40:31.560 --> 40:33.200
-What's going on?
-Liv? Can you hear me?

40:33.280 --> 40:35.760
-You okay?
-Obviously she's not okay, is she?

40:35.840 --> 40:36.680
-Mike!
-What?

40:36.760 --> 40:37.880
-You okay?
-Livia!

40:43.120 --> 40:44.240
Ella, come on.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.640
Just forget about those photos.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.920
Try and eat something.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.160
Hey, mate, how you doing?

41:52.680 --> 41:53.520
Olivia!

41:54.040 --> 41:54.880
Olivia...

41:54.960 --> 41:57.400
I'm fine. Honestly, Dad, I'm okay.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.360
Case from nine months ago.

42:05.440 --> 42:08.400
Blackmail of a woman committing adultery
with her son's teacher.

42:08.920 --> 42:11.080
The blackmailer was asking
for 10,000 pounds.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.240
No one charged?

42:12.320 --> 42:14.280
Nope. The case went nowhere.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.520
Get financial records,
whatever we can find:

42:17.600 --> 42:19.240
personal and business.

42:19.320 --> 42:21.600
And Heidi's recent phone history.

42:21.680 --> 42:24.600
If someone was trying to blackmail her,
there must be a traceable link.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.440
Yo, Jojo.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.320
What do you want, idiot?

42:28.400 --> 42:29.400
Interesting development.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.760
The office at Heidi's café,
we did some forensics,

42:31.840 --> 42:33.760
and we found something
that could be significant.

42:35.640 --> 42:36.600
Like what?

42:37.080 --> 42:38.200
Boys, dinner's ready.

42:46.160 --> 42:47.520
-Mr. Price?
-Yeah.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.080
I am DS Johanna Griffin.
This is DC Wesley Ross.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.360
Is this about my wife?

42:52.800 --> 42:55.080
-Corinne?
-Is she all right? Have you found her?

42:57.040 --> 42:57.960
No.

42:58.720 --> 42:59.560
Can we come in?

43:01.880 --> 43:02.720
No.

43:03.440 --> 43:04.560
What's happened?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.640
I've got kids inside.
Just tell me what's happened.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.680
We need to speak to your wife immediately.

43:12.080 --> 43:12.920
Why?

43:13.880 --> 43:17.000
We have reason to believe your wife
was at the scene of a murder.
