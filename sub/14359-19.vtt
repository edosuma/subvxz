(vacuum cleaner whirring)

00:10.385 --> 00:12.471
LOIS:

00:10.385 --> 00:12.471
Hal?

00:16.266 --> 00:17.058
Are you smoking again?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.059
No!

00:18.101 --> 00:19.520
I am cleaning.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.229
Do you smell smoke?

00:19.561 --> 00:21.229
No, but I...

00:21.271 --> 00:23.231
No, Lois, if I wanted

00:21.271 --> 00:23.231
to smoke a cigar

00:23.273 --> 00:25.066
I wouldn't be sneaking around

00:25.108 --> 00:26.318
like a scared little

00:25.108 --> 00:26.318
schoolboy.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.488
I  would do it

00:26.360 --> 00:29.488
out in the open like a man.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.119
That was our third shop vac.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.080
That is our last shop vac.

Francis, I don't want to hear

01:17.369 --> 01:18.495
another argument about it.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.956
You are going to fix

01:18.537 --> 01:20.956
the roof.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.499
That is totally unfair!

01:22.541 --> 01:23.918
I come home

01:22.541 --> 01:23.918
from school and

01:23.959 --> 01:25.126
you immediately

01:23.959 --> 01:25.126
put me to work.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.127
Well, someone has to do it,

01:26.169 --> 01:28.213
and you know your father

01:26.169 --> 01:28.213
is terrified of heights.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.131
He is not terrified!

01:30.173 --> 01:31.717
The last time

01:30.173 --> 01:31.717
he changed a lightbulb,

01:31.759 --> 01:33.385
we had to talk him down

01:31.759 --> 01:33.385
from the table.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.136
You are going to do this.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.389
Why don't you just put

01:35.178 --> 01:37.389
a choke chain around my neck

01:37.431 --> 01:39.266
and make me sleep

01:37.431 --> 01:39.266
in the garage?!

01:40.768 --> 01:43.645
This is what we call

01:40.768 --> 01:43.645
a "level four" rage.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.189
The only way not to get nailed

01:43.687 --> 01:46.189
is to make no sudden moves

01:46.231 --> 01:50.151
and avoid eye contact

01:46.231 --> 01:50.151
at all costs.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.613
(spoon clatters

01:50.193 --> 01:52.613
on bowl)

01:54.865 --> 01:56.157
And  you...

01:56.199 --> 01:58.326
You think just because

01:56.199 --> 01:58.326
you hide the note,

01:58.368 --> 02:00.370
the parent-teacher meeting

01:58.368 --> 02:00.370
will just go away?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.414
Mom, Mr. Woodward

02:00.412 --> 02:02.414
is totally out to get me.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.083
Every teacher

02:02.456 --> 02:04.083
since kindergarten

02:04.124 --> 02:05.084
has been out to get you.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.919
I know. It upsets me, too.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.088
(sniffs)

02:28.231 --> 02:30.109
(Hal whistling)

02:30.150 --> 02:33.570
Why is the drain

02:30.150 --> 02:33.570
still clogged?

02:33.612 --> 02:37.198
(stammering)

02:37.240 --> 02:39.409
Uh, honey, there was

02:37.240 --> 02:39.409
a, you know...

02:39.451 --> 02:41.202
I was only seconds away from...

02:41.244 --> 02:42.287
It's a funny thing,

02:41.244 --> 02:42.287
see...

02:42.329 --> 02:44.581
Oh, what a mess!

02:42.329 --> 02:44.581
Look at that!

02:44.623 --> 02:48.209
That is a milk ring

02:44.623 --> 02:48.209
on the table.

02:49.962 --> 02:54.800
Reese is still searching

02:49.962 --> 02:54.800
for academic truth.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.385
His...

02:57.427 --> 03:00.221
focus is diffuse.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.474
His initiative

03:00.263 --> 03:02.474
is waning, and...

03:02.516 --> 03:05.602
it's preventing

03:02.516 --> 03:05.602
his full potentiation.

03:05.644 --> 03:08.271
What?

03:08.313 --> 03:12.442
To put it simply,

03:08.313 --> 03:12.442
Reese isn't self-actualized.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.235
Look, maybe I could

03:12.484 --> 03:14.235
just give you a topic

03:14.277 --> 03:16.404
and you could tell

03:14.277 --> 03:16.404
us "good" or "bad."

03:16.446 --> 03:17.698
That would help

03:16.446 --> 03:17.698
us here.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.242
Reese is flunking

03:17.739 --> 03:21.242
almost every subject,

03:21.284 --> 03:23.244
and I'm going to recommend

03:23.286 --> 03:26.040
that he be moved

03:23.286 --> 03:26.040
into the remedial class.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.833
And that's

03:26.081 --> 03:27.833
a euphemism for...

03:27.875 --> 03:29.501
The remedial class.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.252
(laughs)

03:31.294 --> 03:35.256
No.  No, no, no,

03:31.294 --> 03:35.256
no, no, no, no.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
No,  no,  that is

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
not an option.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.301
We'll get him

03:37.300 --> 03:38.301
to buckle down.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.511
I hope it's that simple.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.055
Reese will get

03:39.553 --> 03:41.055
back on track.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.514
We'll see to it

03:41.096 --> 03:42.514
if it kills him.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.517
I'm glad to see

03:42.556 --> 03:45.517
your level of commitment.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.936
I'm really happy we had

03:45.559 --> 03:47.936
this chance to talk.

03:47.978 --> 03:51.148
So we can go now.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.649
I don't want to hear

03:51.190 --> 03:52.649
any excuses.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.275
You will sit down every night

03:54.317 --> 03:56.277
and work

03:54.317 --> 03:56.277
until those grades are up.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.654
Why do  I  have to tutor him?

03:57.696 --> 03:58.446
Because

03:58.488 --> 03:59.781
God gave you a giant brain.

03:59.823 --> 04:00.908
Blame him.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.492
Reese screws up,

04:00.949 --> 04:02.492
and I get punished for it?

04:02.534 --> 04:03.785
Where's the logic

04:02.534 --> 04:03.785
in  that?

04:03.827 --> 04:06.496
Malcolm, I have zero tolerance

04:03.827 --> 04:06.496
on this one.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.457
Finally, Mom found

04:06.538 --> 04:09.457
the courage to

04:06.538 --> 04:09.457
speak her mind.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.919
Why aren't you fixing that roof?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.295
It's 40 degrees out there.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.295
I'll freeze.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.296
And it's going to rain.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.091
That's why you have to fix

04:15.338 --> 04:17.091
the roof.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.300
Well, maybe if you didn't buy

04:17.132 --> 04:19.300
such crappy shingles,

04:19.342 --> 04:20.468
it wouldn't leak all the time.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.345
Francis, as long as you are

04:20.510 --> 04:22.345
in this house,

04:22.387 --> 04:24.305
you will do as I say.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.891
You know what, Mom?

04:25.933 --> 04:26.850
No.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.311
I'm too old to be

04:26.892 --> 04:30.311
bullied by you.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.980
Our whole lives,

04:30.353 --> 04:31.980
you have done nothing

04:32.022 --> 04:34.482
but dictate what

04:32.022 --> 04:34.482
you  wanted.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.110
You're the boss

04:34.524 --> 04:36.110
of the world,

04:36.151 --> 04:37.318
and we're all

04:36.151 --> 04:37.318
sick of it.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.321
This may be your roof,

04:37.360 --> 04:40.321
but we live here, too.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.322
We are human beings

04:41.364 --> 04:43.324
with rights, and I'm hereby

04:41.364 --> 04:43.324
putting an end

04:43.366 --> 04:44.576
to your reign of terror.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.327
You should have seen

04:44.618 --> 04:46.327
the look on her face.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.704
It was  totally

04:46.369 --> 04:47.704
worth it.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.331
Sounds like

04:47.746 --> 04:50.331
you-you've had it rough.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.417
Oh, man, you have  no  idea.

04:54.836 --> 04:55.712
Thanks.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.006
I've got a place

04:55.754 --> 04:58.006
near the bus station.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.342
It's warm and fairly dry.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.344
You can stay there

05:01.384 --> 05:03.344
for a while.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.346
If-if you want to.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.932
You'd do that for me?

05:06.974 --> 05:07.933
It's a tough world.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.228
We've got to look out

05:07.975 --> 05:11.228
for each other.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.438
Thanks.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.777
Richie!

05:17.317 --> 05:18.777
Dude!

05:18.819 --> 05:20.361
I heard your mom kicked you out.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.655
You want to stay at my place?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.448
You are a  lifesaver!

05:23.490 --> 05:24.866
Could you give me a lift to...

05:24.908 --> 05:27.577
Sorry, man. We're

05:24.908 --> 05:27.577
going the other way.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.002
Hi.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.544
Why aren't you flying?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.173
My name is Dewey.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.382
Good to meet you, Tony.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.759
Want to play?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.137
Okay, but I get to be

05:42.801 --> 05:45.137
the red team.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.390
Look, I don't like this

05:47.430 --> 05:49.390
any better than you do.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.976
Let's just get

05:49.432 --> 05:50.976
it over with.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.394
Dude, this book's

05:51.018 --> 05:53.394
totally wrecked.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.395
What did you

05:53.436 --> 05:54.395
do to it?

05:54.437 --> 05:55.563
I threw it at a duck.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.275
Well, where's

05:55.605 --> 05:58.275
your math book?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.400
Which half?

05:59.442 --> 06:01.320
We'll just start

05:59.442 --> 06:01.320
with geography, then.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.403
I don't  take  geography!

06:02.445 --> 06:03.404
Yes, you do.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.406
You got a grade in it.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.742
Oh, that  can't  be good.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.578
Mi casa es su casa.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.789
This may be

06:10.620 --> 06:12.789
my parents' house,

06:12.831 --> 06:14.082
but, dude...

06:14.124 --> 06:16.126
down here,

06:14.124 --> 06:16.126
anything goes.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.045
Oh! What is that smell?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.420
It could be

06:18.086 --> 06:19.420
the laundry.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.215
It could be

06:19.462 --> 06:21.215
the mildew.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.465
It could be

06:21.256 --> 06:22.465
that rat I shot.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.425
I think I wounded it.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.427
It probably crawled

06:24.467 --> 06:26.427
into a hole in the wall

06:26.469 --> 06:29.430
to die or something.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.431
What's this?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
It's your bed.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
You got to blow it up.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.436
(television

06:32.851 --> 06:35.436
playing softly)

06:35.478 --> 06:39.440
Welcome to Chez Richie.

06:39.482 --> 06:44.445
Rule number one:

06:39.482 --> 06:44.445
there are no rules.

06:44.487 --> 06:49.076
Rule number two:

06:44.487 --> 06:49.076
no shoes on the sofa.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.169
It is  so  real.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.096
Come on. What's the answer?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.722
You can do this.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.486
We've gone over this

07:21.108 --> 07:25.486
a thousand times.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.322
You have to carry the tenths.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.407
Tenths have to go someplace.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.575
Tenths don't just float around.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.659
Get smarter already!

07:31.701 --> 07:34.746
Think. Make your brain work.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.082
I could be outside doing

07:34.788 --> 07:37.082
anything  other than this.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.500
But, no. I'm stuck in here

07:37.124 --> 07:39.500
babysitting this...

07:39.542 --> 07:41.502
4.2.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.504
That's right.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
I mean...

07:45.548 --> 07:47.508
I actually understand this.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.095
The tenths have to go someplace.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.722
Great. Let's move on

07:50.137 --> 07:52.722
to the next one.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.358
(hammering)

08:09.572 --> 08:10.531
(sighs)

08:10.573 --> 08:13.701
Hal! Come down from there!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.412
(high-pitched voice):

08:13.743 --> 08:15.412
Hi, honey.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.414
What do you think

08:15.454 --> 08:17.414
you're doing?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.582
Oh, just... fixing

08:17.456 --> 08:19.582
the shingles.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.376
Francis has responsibilities.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.128
You can't keep covering for him.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.463
This is not about him.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.922
It's about me.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.799
I just wanted to get

08:25.964 --> 08:27.799
some fresh air and...

08:27.841 --> 08:30.551
the view from up here is...

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
is incredible.

08:32.262 --> 08:36.391
Did you ever think

08:32.262 --> 08:36.391
that I might be

08:32.262 --> 08:36.391
enjoying myself?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.559
(screaming hysterically)

08:38.601 --> 08:41.729
I spent two days on it.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.399
There was even a paragraph

08:41.771 --> 08:44.399
that I thought really sucked

08:44.441 --> 08:46.151
so I went back and rewrote it.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.819
Malcolm, I'd never

08:46.193 --> 08:47.819
done that before,

08:47.861 --> 08:50.238
but last night...

08:47.861 --> 08:50.238
I mean, look at me.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.158
I'm going on and on

08:50.280 --> 08:53.158
while you're sitting

08:50.280 --> 08:53.158
here trying to read.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.284
How's the grammar?

08:54.326 --> 08:56.286
Never mind.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.413
Reese...

08:58.455 --> 09:01.666
This is C-minus work.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.377
All right!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.377
Nice job!

09:03.418 --> 09:05.045
You're not just saying that?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.422
No. This is seriously the best

09:05.086 --> 09:07.422
work I've ever seen you do.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.423
Yes! That's great!

09:08.465 --> 09:09.966
I couldn't have done it

09:08.465 --> 09:09.966
without you!

09:10.008 --> 09:11.051
Thanks, Malcolm.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.802
BOTH:

09:11.092 --> 09:12.802
Ew!

09:15.096 --> 09:17.391
I kicked your ass!

09:17.432 --> 09:18.599
LOIS:

09:17.432 --> 09:18.599
You got another "F"!

09:18.641 --> 09:20.018
Mom, I read that paper.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.853
It's not an "F"!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.853
Then what is this?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.646
We've been studying

09:21.895 --> 09:23.646
four hours a night.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.981
Well, guess what.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.981
It's not enough.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.607
You're going to study

09:25.023 --> 09:26.607
eight hours a night

09:26.649 --> 09:28.235
if that's what it takes

09:26.649 --> 09:28.235
to get your grades up,

09:28.276 --> 09:29.777
and that's what

09:28.276 --> 09:29.777
you're going to do.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.777
But, Mom...

09:29.819 --> 09:30.987
I don't see a mother here.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.655
All I see is a warden

09:31.029 --> 09:32.655
with two prisoners

09:32.697 --> 09:33.823
who are out of their cell.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.200
Now get back in there!

09:35.242 --> 09:38.995
HAL:

09:35.242 --> 09:38.995
Oh, oh, oh!

09:39.037 --> 09:40.621
Not like this.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.623
(screaming)

09:42.665 --> 09:44.834
I'm okay! I'm okay!

09:51.674 --> 09:53.218
Okay, you know what?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.844
It's freezing, but

09:53.260 --> 09:54.844
I don't need heat

09:54.886 --> 09:56.513
'cause I got

09:54.886 --> 09:56.513
justice on my side.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.638
Mom will cave.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.639
She'll cave.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.850
It's going to

09:58.681 --> 10:00.850
be so sweet.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.352
(grunts)

10:02.394 --> 10:05.021
Could you do that in

10:02.394 --> 10:05.021
the bathroom, Richie?

10:05.063 --> 10:08.316
Dude, no one's going in there

10:05.063 --> 10:08.316
for at least six hours.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.652
Well, then, could you do it

10:08.358 --> 10:11.652
over a wastebasket or something?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.947
And can we cool it

10:11.694 --> 10:13.947
on the porno for,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.947
like, five minutes?

10:13.988 --> 10:15.865
Yeah. When this is over,

10:13.988 --> 10:15.865
I'll just pop in

10:15.907 --> 10:17.284
Sluts of the Big Ten.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.035
No. No more porn.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.287
Dude...

10:20.328 --> 10:22.497
that's a documentary.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.542
Ow!

10:25.584 --> 10:27.252
God, my eye!

10:27.294 --> 10:29.254
Hey, try to find

10:27.294 --> 10:29.254
that toenail, Francis.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.590
It is so creepy

10:29.296 --> 10:31.590
to step on those things.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.673
Ow!

10:32.715 --> 10:34.675
Come on, Reese, the

10:32.715 --> 10:34.675
test is in two hours!

10:34.717 --> 10:35.927
This is too much, Malcolm.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.512
I'll never pass this thing.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.056
There's 30 true-false

10:37.554 --> 10:40.056
questions and five essays.

10:40.098 --> 10:40.974
It's impossible.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.683
So, Reese,

10:41.015 --> 10:42.683
today's the big test?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.478
What do you have to get

10:42.725 --> 10:44.478
on this thing

10:44.519 --> 10:46.396
to say out of remedial class?

10:46.438 --> 10:48.523
A "B."

10:48.565 --> 10:49.608
(laughter)

10:49.649 --> 10:51.359
No, guys, he's serious.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.695
But you're... an idiot.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.406
You're right.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.326
Yeah. The only way

10:56.448 --> 10:59.326
this idiot's going

10:56.448 --> 10:59.326
to pass the test

10:59.367 --> 11:01.702
is if somebody else

10:59.367 --> 11:01.702
takes it for the idiot.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.538
Right, idiot?

11:03.580 --> 11:04.705
Stevie set the precedent!

11:04.747 --> 11:05.873
You had a chance

11:04.747 --> 11:05.873
for rebuttal,

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
but since you

11:05.915 --> 11:06.916
didn't answer

11:06.958 --> 11:08.168
you waived your right!

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
Therefore, it's an

11:08.209 --> 11:09.710
agreed-upon term!

11:09.752 --> 11:11.754
What am I going to do?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.756
I can't get put in

11:11.796 --> 11:13.756
the remedial class.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.634
They walk to

11:13.798 --> 11:15.634
the cafeteria

11:15.674 --> 11:17.135
holding each other's belts.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.219
Unless...

11:18.261 --> 11:19.513
maybe Lloyd's right.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.723
Maybe someone  should

11:19.554 --> 11:22.723
take the test for you.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.725
You mean cheat?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.726
We can't cheat.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.228
Mom will kill us.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.229
And it's wrong.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.191
But more importantly,

11:28.271 --> 11:31.191
Mom would kill us!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.109
Hey, we're out

11:31.232 --> 11:33.109
of options here, Reese.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.529
You're going to get caught.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.529
No, we're not.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.613
And you know why?

11:36.655 --> 11:38.615
Because we have four

11:36.655 --> 11:38.615
brilliant minds here

11:38.657 --> 11:39.782
to help plan this out.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.742
You had to appeal to my vanity,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.742
didn't you?

11:41.784 --> 11:42.743
I'm in.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.621
I'm sorry,

11:42.785 --> 11:44.621
but I am honor-bound

11:44.663 --> 11:47.832
to report this conversation

11:44.663 --> 11:47.832
to the vice-principal.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.750
Then we're

11:47.874 --> 11:49.750
honor-bound to report

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
you still sleep

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
with an Elmo blankie.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.254
Okay, I'm in.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.935
We, uh...

12:04.807 --> 12:07.935
here's the VCR you ordered.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.646
I didn't order a VCR.

12:09.688 --> 12:10.813
Yes, you did!

12:10.855 --> 12:11.939
Feel free to call and verify.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.608
I know the extension number.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.193
There's someone there right now.

12:15.235 --> 12:15.860
That won't be...

12:15.902 --> 12:17.028
Or you can take a look

12:17.070 --> 12:18.238
at this A/V

12:17.070 --> 12:18.238
equipment schedule.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.781
Your name and class hour's

12:18.279 --> 12:20.781
right here on page seven

12:20.823 --> 12:21.782
in nonstudent handwriting.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
WOODWARD:

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
All right.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.203
Go ahead and leave it.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.787
Okay.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
No, no, you said

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
you didn't order a cart

12:28.831 --> 12:30.166
so you're not going to get one.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.044
We'll just be leaving and

12:30.208 --> 12:33.044
pushing this out the door.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.880
Ah, here it is!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.440
Hey, watch out!

12:53.481 --> 12:57.068
Be... the cannonball.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.824
Are you all right?

13:03.866 --> 13:06.953
Way to go... hot rod!

13:22.176 --> 13:24.512
(coughing)

13:41.780 --> 13:45.032
Okay, well, there's the rat.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.868
No, Tony, that's not fair.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.872
Today it's my cartoons

13:47.910 --> 13:51.872
before  school

13:51.914 --> 13:54.875
and your cartoons  after  school.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
Fine, Tony, be that way.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.132
I don't want to be

13:57.295 --> 14:01.132
your friend anyway.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.891
Tony!

14:10.933 --> 14:13.186
I can't stay mad at you either.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.895
Hey...

14:15.938 --> 14:17.898
Did you get that

14:15.938 --> 14:17.898
history test back yet?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.066
Not yet.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.066
No, haven't seen it.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.236
You both better

14:19.108 --> 14:22.236
pray for a "B."

14:23.946 --> 14:25.906
Hey, did Francis call

14:23.946 --> 14:25.906
you at work yet?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
No. No, I haven't talked to him

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
since he...

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
He thinks he's making

14:27.950 --> 14:29.910
some kind of point

14:29.952 --> 14:30.995
by cutting off all contact.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.121
You know, he should know.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.373
Till he's ready

14:32.163 --> 14:33.373
to apologize,

14:33.414 --> 14:34.915
there's really no

14:33.414 --> 14:34.915
reason to call.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.626
I can't wait to see

14:34.957 --> 14:36.626
the look on his face

14:36.668 --> 14:38.919
when he realizes that

14:36.668 --> 14:38.919
we have figured him out.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.922
Ah! What have we

14:38.961 --> 14:41.922
to figure out, dear?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.508
That I'm in it

14:41.964 --> 14:43.508
for the long haul.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.925
He should know

14:44.967 --> 14:46.511
I am prepared

14:44.967 --> 14:46.511
to go the distance!

14:46.553 --> 14:49.723
You know, I think he likes

14:46.553 --> 14:49.723
tomatoes on his sandwich.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.931
Other bag, Hal.

14:50.973 --> 14:51.932
Ah, right. Bye.

14:51.974 --> 14:52.933
Bye.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.728
LLOYD:

14:52.975 --> 14:54.728
A masterful "B,"

14:54.769 --> 14:55.936
Malcolm.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.731
I could never dumb

14:55.978 --> 14:57.731
myself down like this.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.939
I find this "F"

14:58.981 --> 15:00.817
very troubling.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.944
Something... stinks.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.739
He knows we cheated!

15:05.780 --> 15:08.949
We're going to have

15:05.780 --> 15:08.949
to start cutting separate deals.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.244
He doesn't know anything,

15:08.991 --> 15:11.244
Dabney.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.663
I'm gonna go talk to him.

15:13.705 --> 15:14.581
Mr. Woodward?

15:14.622 --> 15:15.956
I'm Malcolm,

15:14.622 --> 15:15.956
I'm Reese's brother.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.208
Oh, hi, how are you?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.334
Well, Reese is upset.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.127
He thinks he did

15:18.376 --> 15:20.127
better than an "F"

15:20.169 --> 15:21.337
on his history test.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.882
I read it over,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.882
and I sort of thought...

15:23.923 --> 15:24.965
it wasn't half bad.

15:25.007 --> 15:26.342
Do you think

15:25.007 --> 15:26.342
there's any way

15:26.384 --> 15:28.135
you can maybe

15:26.384 --> 15:28.135
take another look?

15:28.177 --> 15:31.138
Malcolm, you should be

15:28.177 --> 15:31.138
commended for your fraternity,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.140
but, uh, the test

15:31.180 --> 15:33.140
deserved an "F."

15:33.182 --> 15:35.602
Mr. Woodward, maybe if you

15:33.182 --> 15:35.602
just looked at it again...

15:35.643 --> 15:37.978
I can't spend a disproportionate

15:35.643 --> 15:37.978
amount of time on Reese.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.564
It's not fair

15:38.020 --> 15:39.564
to the other students.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.816
But he didn't deserve

15:39.606 --> 15:41.816
an "F" on this.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.277
Look, Malcolm, I-I've been

15:41.858 --> 15:44.277
a teacher for a long time

15:44.318 --> 15:46.487
and, uh, I think I know

15:44.318 --> 15:46.487
what Reese is capable of.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.239
I really don't think

15:46.529 --> 15:48.239
you do, because...

15:48.281 --> 15:51.451
Look, you may not want

15:48.281 --> 15:51.451
to hear this about your brother,

15:51.492 --> 15:54.412
but I've known kids like Reese

15:51.492 --> 15:54.412
my whole life.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.204
They're the ones

15:55.246 --> 15:56.456
who throw water at you

15:56.497 --> 15:58.165
so it looks like

15:56.497 --> 15:58.165
you wet your pants.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.626
They aim for your legs

15:59.667 --> 16:00.627
in dodgeball,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.087
and you fall down

16:00.668 --> 16:03.087
and you break your jaw

16:03.129 --> 16:05.506
and you need to have

16:03.129 --> 16:05.506
your mouth wired shut

16:05.548 --> 16:07.383
and your teeth

16:05.548 --> 16:07.383
don't set properly.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.636
And you spend six years

16:07.425 --> 16:09.636
in orthodontia

16:09.677 --> 16:12.472
with the most painfully

16:09.677 --> 16:12.472
embarrassing headgear

16:12.513 --> 16:13.932
ever designed,

16:13.973 --> 16:21.021
which is only because they

16:13.973 --> 16:21.021
don't feel fully actualized.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
That guy's totally

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
out to get you.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.318
Man! I was just using that

16:23.065 --> 16:25.318
as an excuse.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.737
He is so dead

16:25.359 --> 16:27.737
when Mom finds out!

16:27.779 --> 16:29.029
Reese, we can't bust him.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
If we rat him out,

16:29.071 --> 16:31.031
then Mom will know

16:31.073 --> 16:33.743
we cheated.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.954
We're doomed.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.831
KIDS (chanting):

16:35.995 --> 16:37.831
Two is after one.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.750
Three is after two.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.336
Four is after three.

16:43.377 --> 16:48.716
Something is after something

16:48.758 --> 16:50.885
and then we get

16:48.758 --> 16:50.885
to ten!

16:52.679 --> 16:54.054
(footsteps on stairs)

16:54.096 --> 16:55.890
Good lord!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.890
FRANCIS:

16:54.096 --> 16:55.890
Thank God

16:54.096 --> 16:55.890
you're here!

16:55.932 --> 16:58.058
I was afraid you weren't going

16:55.932 --> 16:58.058
to get my message at work.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.352
What happened

16:58.100 --> 16:59.352
to your eye...?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.061
Hey, how do you guys want

16:59.393 --> 17:01.061
your burgers?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.104
Just a sec, man.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.481
All right, so

17:02.146 --> 17:03.481
I got it all worked out.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.942
You tell Mom that you need me

17:03.523 --> 17:05.942
to repair the lawnmower,

17:05.984 --> 17:07.067
and then I hang out

17:05.984 --> 17:07.067
and I just...

17:07.109 --> 17:09.236
No, no, I-I'm just not going

17:07.109 --> 17:09.236
to do that, Francis.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.154
Hey, you

17:09.278 --> 17:10.154
guys better

17:10.196 --> 17:11.280
figure it out quick.

17:11.322 --> 17:13.240
This cheap-ass trash can's

17:11.322 --> 17:13.240
melting.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.075
Well, maybe you could

17:13.282 --> 17:15.075
talk to her then?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.328
Just calm her down

17:15.117 --> 17:17.328
so that I could come

17:15.117 --> 17:17.328
home, maybe today even?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.956
Francis, you've got to stop

17:17.370 --> 17:19.956
putting me in the middle!

17:19.998 --> 17:21.374
What, you're just going to let

17:19.998 --> 17:21.374
her win this round, too?!

17:21.415 --> 17:22.542
Francis, there is

17:21.415 --> 17:22.542
nothing that I can do.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.084
You know what

17:22.583 --> 17:24.084
the problem is here?

17:24.126 --> 17:26.086
You and your mother

17:24.126 --> 17:26.086
are exactly alike!

17:26.128 --> 17:27.087
That's a lie!

17:27.129 --> 17:28.255
That is  true!

17:28.297 --> 17:30.257
You're both stubborn

17:28.297 --> 17:30.257
and unwilling to bend.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.092
So, fine, you win!

17:32.134 --> 17:33.093
Congratulations!

17:33.135 --> 17:34.595
This is your prize!

17:34.637 --> 17:36.723
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:34.637 --> 17:36.723
I have to go.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.559
It smells like something died

17:36.764 --> 17:39.559
in here.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.604
Your father's right, man.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.315
Sometimes you can be

17:43.646 --> 17:46.315
so stupid.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.027
Uh-oh.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.112
WOODWARD:

17:51.153 --> 17:52.112
I'm sorry.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.115
No one wanted it to

17:52.154 --> 17:55.115
turn out this way.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.702
I feel like

17:55.157 --> 17:57.702
I let Reese down.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.495
Just keep moving, Tony.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.706
So where does

17:59.537 --> 18:01.706
this leave us?

18:01.748 --> 18:06.002
I think it's best if we make

18:01.748 --> 18:06.002
the switch as soon as possible.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.713
We need to look at this

18:08.755 --> 18:09.589
as an opportunity.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.466
Big opportunity,

18:09.630 --> 18:12.466
being in the dumb class.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.595
Reese, this isn't

18:13.968 --> 18:15.595
what I wanted,

18:15.636 --> 18:18.014
but you haven't

18:15.636 --> 18:18.014
left us any choice.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.810
Mom, don't do this.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.144
It's not

18:22.852 --> 18:24.144
Reese's fault.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.813
He didn't deserve an "F"

18:24.186 --> 18:25.813
on that test.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.232
Malcolm, we've already

18:25.855 --> 18:28.232
had this discussion.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.150
I saw the test,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.150
he did a good job.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.193
He deserved a "B."

18:31.235 --> 18:33.153
This guy is totally

18:31.235 --> 18:33.153
out to get him.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.154
Malcolm...

18:34.196 --> 18:35.573
Look, I'm sorry

18:34.196 --> 18:35.573
you feel that way,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.867
but you can't blame me

18:35.615 --> 18:37.867
for Reese's shortcomings.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.201
Mom, this is the test.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.536
Take a look

18:39.243 --> 18:40.536
at this question.

18:40.578 --> 18:43.039
"What was the cause

18:40.578 --> 18:43.039
of the Great Depression?"

18:43.081 --> 18:44.206
He put down "Black Thursday."

18:44.248 --> 18:45.541
That's a correct answer.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.251
No, that's only

18:45.583 --> 18:47.251
a partial answer.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.420
To get full credit

18:47.293 --> 18:49.420
he should have included

18:49.462 --> 18:51.255
the vast overproduction

18:49.462 --> 18:51.255
in the U.S.,

18:51.297 --> 18:53.466
protectionism

18:51.297 --> 18:53.466
in the foreign markets....

18:53.507 --> 18:54.383
Overexpansion

18:53.507 --> 18:54.383
of credit

18:54.425 --> 18:56.052
and stock market

18:54.425 --> 18:56.052
speculation?

18:56.094 --> 18:57.177
Yes. That would

18:56.094 --> 18:57.177
have been

18:57.219 --> 18:58.471
a complete answer.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
Ha! You didn't read

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
the answer

19:00.222 --> 19:02.182
because that's exactly

19:00.222 --> 19:02.182
what I wrote.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.226
"I" wrote?

19:05.519 --> 19:08.397
The royal "I,"

19:05.519 --> 19:08.397
as in Reese.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.399
Because I think

19:08.439 --> 19:10.399
we can all identify

19:10.441 --> 19:12.192
with what he's going through.

19:12.234 --> 19:16.489
You took that test,

19:12.234 --> 19:16.489
didn't you?

19:17.698 --> 19:18.449
You cheated...

19:18.491 --> 19:20.910
You let him cheat for you?

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
You gave something

19:22.244 --> 19:25.205
he wrote an "F"?!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.707
(thunder crashes)

19:26.749 --> 19:28.417
You  are  out to get him.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.586
Oh, I can't wait to see you

19:28.459 --> 19:30.586
expelled or disbarred

19:30.628 --> 19:31.921
or whatever it is they do

19:31.963 --> 19:34.381
to creepy little men

19:31.963 --> 19:34.381
who abuse their power.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.383
There is no need

19:34.423 --> 19:36.383
for name-calling.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.219
I suggest we just leave

19:36.425 --> 19:39.219
things as they are...

19:39.261 --> 19:40.513
Oh, I don't think so.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.598
WOODWARD:

19:40.554 --> 19:42.598
Here's the situation:

19:42.640 --> 19:43.808
if you notify the school,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.226
then the school will find out

19:43.850 --> 19:46.226
Malcolm cheated.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.812
He'll be expelled.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.814
Don't you threaten me.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.231
This isn't a threat.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.441
I just don't think

19:51.273 --> 19:52.441
you'd throw away

19:52.483 --> 19:55.153
the son who achieves for...

19:55.194 --> 19:56.904
well, Reese.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.448
You don't think I'd

19:56.946 --> 19:59.448
sacrifice this one?

20:00.449 --> 20:02.160
Let me explain

20:00.449 --> 20:02.160
something to you.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.037
I would sell Malcolm

20:02.201 --> 20:04.037
down the river

20:04.078 --> 20:05.287
in a heartbeat

20:04.078 --> 20:05.287
to save Reese.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
What?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
Malcolm's

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
gonna be fine

20:07.289 --> 20:08.124
no matter what happens.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.249
Maybe he'll have to go

20:09.291 --> 20:11.169
to junior college or

20:09.291 --> 20:11.169
start off blue collar,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.253
but he'll work his way up

20:11.210 --> 20:13.253
to management eventually.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.714
Reese is the one

20:13.295 --> 20:14.714
who needs saving.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.300
I don't believe you.

20:19.385 --> 20:23.514
No mother could ever be

20:19.385 --> 20:23.514
that callous to her own son.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.268
Mom, please let me come home!

20:28.310 --> 20:31.271
I'm cold and I'm hungry!

20:31.313 --> 20:32.773
Please,

20:31.313 --> 20:32.773
I'll fix the roof!

20:32.815 --> 20:36.276
I'll paint the house,

20:32.815 --> 20:36.276
I'll do anything, Mom!

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
Please, just let me live

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
indoors, Mom!

20:38.487 --> 20:40.322
Please, I want to be warm again!

20:40.364 --> 20:41.866
Mom, please!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.201
(sobbing)

20:44.326 --> 20:47.205
Maybe we can work something out.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.291
There you go, Tony.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.543
Night-night.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.090
Oh, my God, look at

20:54.336 --> 20:57.090
the size of that thing.

20:57.131 --> 20:57.882
(screams)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.133
Dewey, what in the...?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.928
Run, Tony, Run!

21:03.345 --> 21:06.306
Why are they always named Tony?

21:06.348 --> 21:07.892
Bye, Tony.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.853
I love you.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.941
(hammers pounding)

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
Yeah, it's cold, filthy

21:20.404 --> 21:22.322
and dangerous,

21:22.364 --> 21:23.699
but I say we got off easy.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.326
If we all pitch in,

21:23.741 --> 21:26.326
we should be done in a week.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.328
Hey, hurry up.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.538
I'm trying.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.166
I've got tar in my eyes.
