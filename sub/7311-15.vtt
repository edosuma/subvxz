WEBVTT

00:03.710 --> 00:05.186
You want to make a statement?

00:05.210 --> 00:07.116
- You want to gangsta up, homie?
- Yeah.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.906
You got to go bold, all right?
Double action old school.

00:09.930 --> 00:14.770
It's sweet, it's simple, accurate
never jams Here we go, give it a try.

00:15.430 --> 00:18.380
- Where?
- I don't know-just-just shoot the pipe.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.680
Nice shot.

00:23.910 --> 00:24.986
What else you got?

00:25.010 --> 00:27.480
All right, got the homie's
best friend here, all right?

00:27.510 --> 00:29.836
It's a nine mill, it's
Beretta it's Italian.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.740
All right, it's 15
plus one in the snout

00:31.780 --> 00:33.650
I'll throw in a box of
hollow point hot loads.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.496
Trust me, your stuff
will be safe, okay?

00:35.520 --> 00:37.610
Here, here we go.

00:41.990 --> 00:43.000
Bad boy is tight!

00:43.040 --> 00:46.200
You ain't seen the
baddest boy yet, all right?

00:48.470 --> 00:52.510
Sweet mother of God
The pagans shall quake.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.866
It's a Tech 9 It's
top of the line.

00:54.890 --> 00:56.050
Fully automatic.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.440
You can empty the clip
in four seconds flat.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.146
- Are you man enough for this?
- Yeah.

01:00.170 --> 01:01.026
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.370
Yeah, all right, give it
a shot, give it a ride.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.360
- You like that?
- Yeah.

01:09.710 --> 01:12.500
- You're looking taller already, buddy.
- Yeah!

01:27.160 --> 01:29.370
Let's get the hell out of
here! Let's go! Let's go!

02:01.770 --> 02:03.266
Miss anything, McLovin?

02:03.290 --> 02:06.746
Just this It's from a woman
named Melinda She had to postpone.

02:06.770 --> 02:07.740
Postpone what?

02:07.770 --> 02:11.246
I don't know Figured
that you'd figure it out.

02:11.270 --> 02:13.726
How did she sound?

02:13.750 --> 02:16.926
I ask the question, you give
the answer How did she sound?

02:16.950 --> 02:19.420
- I don't know, Tony.
- You don't know.

02:20.150 --> 02:23.016
Well, why don't you try using
your words, Mr Gem City?

02:23.040 --> 02:25.686
Devastated? Despondent?

02:25.710 --> 02:27.336
Delighted.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.586
All right What's
her number, McDetail?

02:29.610 --> 02:30.630
She didn't leave one.

02:30.660 --> 02:34.906
It's customary to get a name, a
number and a complete message.

02:34.930 --> 02:38.500
This is not a complete message
This is a complete mess.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.950
Melinda.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.746
How many Melindas do
you have in that thing?

02:45.770 --> 02:48.286
I don't know It could have been
the girl I talked to at the gym.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.390
You don't go to the gym.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.626
Maybe it was the girl I
talked to at the dog park.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.250
You don't have a dog.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.887
Oh, it could have been that girl I met
at the concession stand.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.453
While my date was in the bathroom.

02:59.488 --> 03:00.700
You need a secretary.

03:00.740 --> 03:01.690
Or a therapist.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.826
Or both.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.846
Shots fired in Liberty
Heights Saddle it up.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.716
If we were called every time shots
were fired at Liberty Heights.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.790
Yeah, Well, Metro responded
They found a dead Marine.

03:13.130 --> 03:16.380
Victim is Private First
Class Emilio Salazar.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.026
Joined the Marines four months ago.

03:18.050 --> 03:20.056
Scheduled for deployment next week.

03:20.080 --> 03:20.956
Ducky?

03:20.980 --> 03:23.950
Stuck in traffic Should
be here in about 20 minutes.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.406
Nine millimeter shells
Possibly two guns.

03:26.430 --> 03:29.983
And based on the level
of penetration on that wall

03:30.018 --> 03:32.501
I would say 357.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.606
No shells, which means a revolver.

03:35.630 --> 03:36.936
One shooter, three weapons.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.000
There's two sets of footprints.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.486
Shooter could have had a spotter.

03:41.510 --> 03:43.810
Or a lookout - Or a witness.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.100
Hey, DiNozzo

03:48.050 --> 03:48.930
McGee.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.606
New Marine regulations
don't allow for exposed ink.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.696
He had his tat removed, laser.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.896
Looks like "P".

03:56.920 --> 03:58.690
It looks like this.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.296
PCS

04:00.320 --> 04:02.636
All right, I'll check
with Metro's gang unit.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.080
Bullets hit the skylight

04:06.480 --> 04:08.396
killing our Marine.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.936
Sending him on a very
short bungee plunge.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.296
But why shoot your
hostage from down here?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.936
Maybe they were sending a message.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.130
The kind McGee takes-
cryptic, hard to decipher.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.610
Blood.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.656
This blood is dried.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.526
But Metro made their "shots
fired" call less than an hour ago.

04:37.550 --> 04:40.350
Looks like the West
just got a bit wilder.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.620
Cuffs, boss.

04:45.180 --> 04:47.276
Skin, blood.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.730
This guy was strapped
up here for a while.

04:49.770 --> 04:53.056
That's why prefer
the fur handcuffs.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.956
Not really, boss That's for her

04:54.980 --> 04:57.220
I don't wear the cuffs.

04:58.060 --> 05:00.676
Someone was trying
to send a message.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.076
Written in blood.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.980
Phone number?

05:05.110 --> 05:06.496
Not a phone number

05:06.520 --> 05:08.326
I don't know what the "G"
stands for, but it's nine digits.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.186
Could be a military
service number I'll run it.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.740
You don't have to.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.920
It's mine.

05:26.210 --> 05:27.446
Where is he?

05:27.470 --> 05:29.236
Um, I'm not exactly sure, Director.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.906
Tell him I need to see him

05:30.930 --> 05:33.096
I will give him the message.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.216
And the nature of the message

05:34.240 --> 05:37.486
I'll include who it's
from, and the number.

05:37.510 --> 05:41.970
Why would anyone leave Gibbs' Marine
service number on a rooftop crime scene.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.576
Agent Gibbs' desk.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.566
No, he's not here.

05:49.590 --> 05:52.706
But I'd be happy to
take a detailed message.

05:52.730 --> 05:55.246
Flight arrives at 2:30.

05:55.270 --> 05:58.360
Can I take a name
or a return number?

05:58.390 --> 06:00.310
Oh, okay I will.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.946
A name and a number.

06:02.970 --> 06:05.196
Enough, okay? I understand

06:05.220 --> 06:06.656
I am sorry, but what
do you want me to do?

06:06.680 --> 06:08.128
You want me to sort through
the database.

06:08.152 --> 06:10.412
Of every call that came into
the switchboard this morning.

06:10.436 --> 06:14.126
And match incoming call to your desk
phone using a date and a time stamp?

06:14.150 --> 06:16.630
Yeah, actually That'd
be great Thanks.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.346
Oh, hey, boss, got two messages for
you, actually, right there Sorry.

06:21.370 --> 06:24.280
Director Vance wants you to
call him back ASAP, and the, uh

06:24.310 --> 06:28.420
the other is, uh And then
there's-there's that one.

06:28.870 --> 06:32.806
Um, it says that the flight arrives
at 2:30 It's from M Street Travel

06:32.830 --> 06:34.100
I assume that's a travel agent.

06:34.130 --> 06:36.106
Didn't say where the flight was
from or who the passenger was.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.006
But if you want to share
that, you can feel.

06:38.030 --> 06:39.536
Dead Marine?

06:39.560 --> 06:42.066
PFC Emilio Salazar Service record

06:42.090 --> 06:45.406
18-year-old Completed basic training
at Parris Island two months ago.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.436
And was stationed at Quantico.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.140
Had more than a service record.

06:50.170 --> 06:54.080
Criminal record goes back
to 2003, when Emilio was 12.

06:54.110 --> 06:56.520
All juvenile offenses
All gang-related.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.030
Gang tattoos.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.466
Or Pecados Capitales.

07:01.490 --> 07:02.480
Capital Fish?

07:02.510 --> 07:05.016
Deadly Sins, you
idiot Fish is pescado.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.306
Don't scoff at me.

07:06.330 --> 07:07.856
Lots of gangs are
named after deadly fish.

07:07.880 --> 07:12.400
There's the Sharks, there's
the Barracudas.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.430
Rumble Fish.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.036
These guys are also
known as the PCs.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.756
Sounds like your kind
of gang, McMotherboard.

07:18.780 --> 07:23.286
Kid lives through six years in a gang
can't survive four months as a Marine.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.916
Maybe someone didn't want
him to leave the gang?

07:25.940 --> 07:28.150
Maybe a rival gang killed him?

07:28.180 --> 07:31.660
Though that wouldn't explain
your service number, boss.

07:31.970 --> 07:33.446
Focus on tracking the killer.

07:33.470 --> 07:35.376
And what about the other person
who may have been held there?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.416
Find the shooter

07:36.440 --> 07:38.346
Vance wanted to call him ASAP, boss.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.000
Heard you the first time, DiNozzo.

07:47.380 --> 07:52.030
Private Jackson, do not shut your
eyes when you squeeze the trigger!

07:54.360 --> 07:57.520
Eyes off the toys, David
We didn't come here to play.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.966
I have not been to
the range in days.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.956
No talking on the range, please.

08:01.980 --> 08:05.025
Well, that's going to be a real
problem, Staff Sergeant Medina.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.038
'Cause I'm real talky
and I have a badge.

08:09.910 --> 08:12.840
Is there somewhere we can talk?

08:14.340 --> 08:19.150
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Clear and lock 'em! Stand by!

08:20.310 --> 08:22.800
Thank you.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.580
A man in your unit
was killed last night.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.236
- How'd it happen?
- Firefight He lost.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.996
- Someone shot him?
- Several times.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.200
You know who did it?

08:35.230 --> 08:37.206
If we did, we would not be here.

08:37.230 --> 08:38.740
Thought you could help.

08:38.770 --> 08:40.025
Any way I can.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.395
He was killed in the
neighborhood where he grew up.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.426
He ever talk about his
past? Gangs, trouble?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.706
All the time He was
trying to escape it.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.320
So you knew he had a record
before he joined the Marines?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.891
Some of these kids grew up in a jungle.

08:50.915 --> 08:53.237
A lot more dangerous than the desert
we're sending them to, you know?

08:53.261 --> 08:57.136
Salazar ever drop names, gang
affiliations, enemies?

08:57.160 --> 08:58.520
Nothing specific.

08:58.560 --> 09:03.487
He had troubles like any kid
who runs in gang circles.

09:03.511 --> 09:04.345
But he didn't name anybody.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.840
If you can think of
anything, let me know.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.750
Berettas-nine
millimeter - Feel free.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.876
- Do you mind?
- Not at all, ma'am.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.090
Do your best.

09:21.740 --> 09:22.886
Oh, God.

09:22.910 --> 09:26.050
Stand by, station two, for live fire!

09:32.690 --> 09:34.810
I prefer the SIG.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.920
A lot of women have
trouble with the Beretta.

09:37.950 --> 09:40.006
Thing's got too much of a kick.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.510
Your sight is a
few millimeters off.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.310
- Really?
- Really.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.357
Prior to PFC Salazar's demise.

09:54.392 --> 09:58.155
Handcuffs made these
abrasions and lacerations.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.246
Yeah, well, he wasn't
held there long.

10:00.270 --> 10:03.856
No He was executed almost
immediately upon his confinement.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.026
As to the cause of
death... Gunshots.

10:07.050 --> 10:08.386
Well, yes and no.

10:08.410 --> 10:12.040
These wounds were made
by machine-gun fire.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.476
The spacing is too symmetrical
for random shooting.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.670
Also, they showed no signs of
redness or braiding and bruising,

10:19.700 --> 10:24.150
indicating that our private was
long dead when he was strafed.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.210
How long?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.960
About six hours based
on his liver temperature.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.680
And here

10:29.710 --> 10:35.136
single round, nine millimeter
punctured the pericardial sac,

10:35.160 --> 10:37.930
causing a cardiac tamponade.

10:37.970 --> 10:42.356
He suffered greatly, Jethro-
perhaps for 20 or 30 minutes-

10:42.380 --> 10:45.096
and he did not die quickly.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.530
The bullet that killed him?

10:46.560 --> 10:50.150
In the capable
hands of Abby Sciuto.

10:51.420 --> 10:56.580
You've never left a scene of a crime
before I arrived until this one, Jethro.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.906
Yeah Had something else to do.

10:59.930 --> 11:03.720
Something to do with your
Marine Corps service number?

11:09.550 --> 11:13.110
I was wondering the
same thing myself.

11:14.130 --> 11:16.636
You're avoiding me

11:16.660 --> 11:19.880
I've been busy
solving a murder, Leon.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.700
When I have something, you'll
be the first to know.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.040
I'm looking for a Marine file.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.470
A classified one.

11:32.510 --> 11:34.926
Top secret, eyes only.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.446
Black Ops.

11:36.470 --> 11:40.560
Gunnery Sergeant
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.816
Next time you having guests, probie
have some scotch in the house.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.233
Ah, you couldn't sweet-talk
the flight attendant.

11:48.268 --> 11:49.075
Out a few of those little bottles?

11:49.110 --> 11:51.826
He wasn't my type - Right.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.956
What's so urgent?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.506
You pulled me away
from my granddaughter.

11:56.530 --> 11:59.540
Just celebrated
her second birthday.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.700
I'm looking for somebody

12:04.590 --> 12:07.100
Rose

12:07.640 --> 12:09.676
Vance know I'm here yet?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.736
Not yet.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.500
Maybe I should borrow a tie

12:15.310 --> 12:18.490
Colombia was a long time ago, gunny.

12:33.570 --> 12:36.500
Only one person knew about her.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.176
You

12:38.200 --> 12:40.666
18 years is a long time, probie.

12:40.690 --> 12:43.636
She's in DCToday

12:43.660 --> 12:45.670
Mike.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.130
What do you want me to say?

12:48.160 --> 12:50.766
Whatever you're not saying.

12:50.790 --> 12:54.216
Well, how do you know
she's here, for sure?

12:54.240 --> 12:58.566
My Marine service number was
written on the roof of a crime scene.

12:58.590 --> 13:00.710
In blood.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.750
That could have been anybody.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.480
I put a "G" on the
end of it, just for her.

13:09.340 --> 13:12.180
I brought her here 17 years ago.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.410
Where is she now?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.776
I haven't seen her since
the day I dropped her off.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.120
Let's start there.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.450
You put her here?

13:42.480 --> 13:45.180
Wasn't such a hellhole then.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.706
Que paso?

13:47.730 --> 13:49.860
Que es lo que miras?

13:56.430 --> 13:59.060
I'm looking for Rose Tamayo.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.760
Ma, alguien esta a la puerta.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.670
Que se les ofrece?

14:08.700 --> 14:11.036
Buscando Rosa Tamayo?

14:11.060 --> 14:14.690
Ella se murio hace diez aÃ±os.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.686
We're a little late.

14:17.710 --> 14:20.320
She died ten years ago.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.770
Guess somebody else knows your
Marine service number, probie.

14:35.910 --> 14:37.976
Howdy, Leon

14:38.000 --> 14:40.120
Mike.

14:40.650 --> 14:43.646
He has information
on a current case.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.906
And I need his help.

14:45.930 --> 14:49.416
Thanks for sorting out that
little pension problem, Leon.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.416
Appreciate it

14:50.440 --> 14:54.650
I didn't do anything I wouldn't
have done for any former agent, Mike.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.670
All by the book.

14:55.700 --> 14:57.866
Absolutely By the book.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.246
That's how we operate now.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.950
Wouldn't have it
any other way, Leon.

15:08.590 --> 15:10.180
Think he noticed my tie?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.256
What do we got?

15:11.280 --> 15:13.596
We canvassed the area
No one is talking.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.906
- There is a smurf war.
- Turf war

15:15.930 --> 15:19.206
between two competing gangs, the
PCs and the Verde Psychos.

15:19.230 --> 15:20.030
Ballistics.

15:20.070 --> 15:22.606
We matched the slug that
killed PFC Salazar to a gun

15:22.630 --> 15:26.436
that was used in an unsolved
robbery two weeks ago And.

15:26.460 --> 15:32.204
Metro's chief suspect is
Victor Carmado, a k a Popeye.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.150
Victor Carmado is a
known member of the PCs.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.320
He was hanging out with his
posse at Liberty Heights today

15:41.350 --> 15:44.090
DiNozzo, Ziva, bring him in.

15:58.650 --> 16:00.216
Abby!

16:00.240 --> 16:03.206
- Howdy, darling!
- Franks! What are you doing here?

16:03.230 --> 16:07.270
Probie thinks I'm here helping him, but
it was just an excuse to come see you.

16:09.210 --> 16:11.790
Abs, turn it down.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.850
This is so cool.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.120
Someone writes your service number
on a roof, and then you just show up.

16:20.150 --> 16:23.596
It's like sending out the bat signal
and having Batman just show up.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.456
And his mentor, Ra's al Ghul.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.356
Or-or like Princess
Lela sending a hologram.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.580
"Help me, Obi-Wan."

16:30.610 --> 16:34.890
And then getting Obi-Wan
with his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn.

16:36.490 --> 16:39.310
You know, it's weird 'cause Liam
Neeson played both the mentors.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.730
You gonna tell me why I'm here?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.580
Oh, um, I ran the blood
from the service number.

16:43.610 --> 16:46.936
It does not match our
dead Marine, Emilio Salazar

16:46.960 --> 16:48.576
I already know that.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.710
Of course you do.

16:49.740 --> 16:50.821
Well, hopefully
it'll be news to you.

16:50.845 --> 16:53.406
That the blood
did belong to another Marine.

16:53.590 --> 16:56.880
Private First Class Tomas Tamayo.

16:57.570 --> 17:00.350
Judging by the look on your
face, that is news to you.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.890
Um, he comes from the same
neighborhood as PFC Salazar.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.011
According to his records.

17:05.046 --> 17:08.183
His mother died ten years ago
after emigrating from Colombia

17:10.130 --> 17:12.119
Rose had a son?

17:12.150 --> 17:15.390
Uh, yeah He was about a year
old when I brought her here.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.069
You knew?

17:18.510 --> 17:21.190
I'm guessing you didn't.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.430
I need an address, Abs

17:23.460 --> 17:25.480
57 Kensington Street.

17:25.510 --> 17:28.060
The home belongs to a
woman named Maggie Scott.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.790
Might want to take
this slow, probie.

17:29.830 --> 17:32.180
Might not like where it leads you.

17:52.270 --> 17:54.900
Popeye Carmado? NCIS.

17:55.610 --> 17:58.070
Are we all listening
to the same song?

17:58.100 --> 18:01.336
Let me guess Ricky Martin fans.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.540
"Livin' La Vida Loca."

18:03.580 --> 18:04.820
You ought to leave, man.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.706
But we just got here.

18:06.730 --> 18:09.596
Yeah But this is a very
dangerous neighborhood.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.220
That's why I brought her.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.940
La Bonita es una federale.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.216
Federales saben buenas.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.740
La Bonita will kick your ass.

18:21.110 --> 18:22.696
Is that right?

18:22.720 --> 18:25.400
You know, bad things happen
in this place, mamita.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.256
But it's so homey, homey

18:28.280 --> 18:30.380
I love what you've
done with the wall here.

18:30.420 --> 18:32.920
"Snoopy loves Chiquita?"

18:32.950 --> 18:35.850
Which one of you sleeps on a
doghouse and which one's a bana?

18:35.890 --> 18:39.050
I'm guessing the love is
between you two Am I wrong?

18:42.460 --> 18:45.040
Think they want to play
rock, paper, scissors?

18:46.880 --> 18:49.140
- You got them?
- I've got them.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.936
What's the matter? Popeye didn't
eat his spinach this morning?

18:56.960 --> 18:59.496
Rico! Chuy!

18:59.520 --> 19:04.160
Rico Suave's stuck in the '90s, and
Chewie's back with theMillennium Falcon.

19:04.190 --> 19:07.260
Let's go see how La Bonitadid.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.780
What took you so long?

19:17.560 --> 19:19.500
McGee!

19:20.090 --> 19:23.236
What are you doing? Why are you
digging through the NCIS database?

19:23.260 --> 19:26.400
This woman called for Tony, and
I didn't get the number.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.780
It was blocked by the carrier, so
I am trying to coordinate a trace.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.470
Well, drop the call This
is much more important.

19:33.890 --> 19:36.160
Okay, what's up?

19:36.620 --> 19:37.876
I heard something.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.700
Not a complete something, a
partial something.

19:40.730 --> 19:44.780
But enough of something to make
me think it means something.

19:44.810 --> 19:50.070
So I need to know if there's any
other something that you know about?

19:50.680 --> 19:53.950
What-I'm-I'm lost.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.786
Okay It's something about Gibbs.

19:59.810 --> 20:04.316
And Colombia And
a woman named Rose.

20:04.340 --> 20:07.060
And a son she had 18 years ago.

20:07.090 --> 20:11.340
That would been 1991-
before Gibbs joined NCIS.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.476
Come on, McGee.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.056
Type something about the
something into something.

20:16.080 --> 20:18.330
Open, he's open.

20:19.420 --> 20:21.200
Give me the ball.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.426
Shoot it.

20:24.450 --> 20:26.500
Nice shooting, lady.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.230
Get a lot of practice around here.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.170
You Maggie Scott?

20:30.970 --> 20:33.290
Hey, Henry, come in for me, okay?

20:35.230 --> 20:37.206
What happened? You guys Metro?

20:37.230 --> 20:38.696
NCIS

20:38.720 --> 20:40.346
Who got hit? Somebody
from this block?

20:40.370 --> 20:43.900
I understand this is the
home of Thomas Tamayo.

20:44.470 --> 20:45.756
Why? Is he all right?

20:45.780 --> 20:48.560
He was involved in a murder.

20:48.860 --> 20:50.000
Oh, my God.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.490
No, he wasn't the victim.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.370
Someone a couple of streets over

20:53.400 --> 20:55.810
Emilio Salazar

20:57.170 --> 21:01.356
Emilio Yeah, he's a, uh, he's
a friend of Tomas's.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.676
His mother, has anyone
contacted Emilio's mother?

21:03.700 --> 21:06.256
Being done now Where is Tomas?

21:06.280 --> 21:09.156
He's on leave, Cape
Hatteras Before Afghanistan.

21:09.180 --> 21:12.046
Wrong He was at a crime
scene last night in DC.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.360
Hold on.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.996
You were his legal guardian?

21:15.020 --> 21:16.926
Legal guardian to
a lot of these kids.

21:16.950 --> 21:18.206
Keeps them out of the system

21:18.230 --> 21:20.416
I just watch them till their
moms get home from work.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.076
Most of them don't have fathers.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.626
Two of them lost
siblings, past couple months.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.256
War?

21:26.280 --> 21:28.466
Gang war.

21:28.490 --> 21:30.600
You're not from
around here, are you?

21:30.640 --> 21:33.446
I moved here after college
Part of the Vista program

21:33.470 --> 21:34.790
I never left.

21:34.820 --> 21:36.976
How'd you become Thomas's guardian?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.950
Tomas moved in about 12 years back.

21:40.990 --> 21:44.470
Then when Rose got sick-
his mother has cancer-

21:44.810 --> 21:47.060
she asked me to look after him.

21:47.260 --> 21:50.590
He's a good kid He's
a really good kid.

21:52.730 --> 21:55.806
Oh, my God, It's okay He's here.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.750
It's Tomas It's Tomas

21:58.990 --> 22:01.090
Tomas!

22:02.820 --> 22:06.666
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine What is this?

22:06.690 --> 22:08.810
I was so worried about you.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.340
What's going on?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.916
You want to tell us where you
been for the past 48 hours?

22:24.940 --> 22:26.636
Cape Hatteras with friends.

22:26.660 --> 22:27.920
We checked.

22:27.950 --> 22:32.276
Your cell calls were all made
from a two-block area of DC.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.186
Why were you being held here?

22:34.210 --> 22:36.110
I wasn't.

22:36.990 --> 22:40.020
My military service number.

22:41.050 --> 22:44.220
Your blood on the roof.

22:47.250 --> 22:50.726
You got my attention, Thomas
I'm here What do you want?

22:50.750 --> 22:53.276
It wasn't me

22:53.300 --> 22:55.800
I cut myself traing

22:56.870 --> 22:58.500
Gibbs and the kid.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.470
It was your damn blood on the roof.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.366
- What's the connection?
- We tested it.

23:02.390 --> 23:04.486
And why the kid gloves?

23:04.510 --> 23:06.096
Hey, let me out!

23:06.120 --> 23:07.366
Our friend from the hood.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.106
- Think he's chilled long enough?
- Let me out of here, man!

23:09.130 --> 23:11.040
Time to unpop his cork.

23:13.980 --> 23:15.090
Let me out of here!

23:15.120 --> 23:18.516
Cool it, Coolio! No
gangbanging on the walls.

23:18.540 --> 23:19.816
Sit down

23:19.840 --> 23:21.696
- I ain't sitting down.
- Sientate!

23:21.720 --> 23:24.306
Or do you want La Bonita
to sit your ass down?

23:24.330 --> 23:26.890
I thought you all forgot
about me, that's all.

23:27.260 --> 23:29.526
You in a hurry to
get somewhere, Popeye?

23:29.550 --> 23:32.896
'Cause you sure ain't going home to
Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea any time soon.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.180
You're going to prison.

23:34.210 --> 23:35.280
Says who?

23:35.320 --> 23:39.156
Says the nine-millimeter slug we
pulled out of PFC Emilio Salazar.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.096
Matches the slug from another
shooting you were involved in.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.080
If witnesses put me there, I'd
have been locked up already.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.900
We have a dead Marine, former
gang member of yours.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.870
This is the murder weapon.

23:50.900 --> 23:54.350
Found dumped in a storm
drain Recognize it?

23:56.550 --> 24:00.020
That's it? That's all you got?

24:00.390 --> 24:02.720
It's all we need.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.260
It's all circumstantial.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.210
I think you got nothing.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.010
I think what you
need is a confession.

24:14.620 --> 24:20.046
You are looking at ten years for
accessory to a murder of a USMarine.

24:20.070 --> 24:23.310
More if we tag you for murder one.

24:23.510 --> 24:26.726
Your sweat was on that roof.

24:26.750 --> 24:29.520
Your pee was on that roof.

24:29.550 --> 24:32.016
Your blood was on that roof.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.196
You gonna tell us what
happened on that roof?

24:35.220 --> 24:37.450
You're gonna tell us
who else was there.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.646
Who put that bullet in PFC Salazar.

24:40.670 --> 24:43.800
We're gonna have to
assume it was you.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.346
I didn't kill Emilio.

24:47.370 --> 24:49.286
- Who did?
- Me

24:49.310 --> 24:51.376
I killed the little bitch.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.576
You killed PFC Salazar?

24:53.600 --> 24:57.986
Yeah, I did it You got me.

24:58.010 --> 25:00.500
The fool deserved to die.

25:01.140 --> 25:02.586
How'd it go down, Victor?

25:02.610 --> 25:04.556
I shot him That's
how it went down.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.020
Put the gun to his head-pow.

25:07.050 --> 25:08.060
Blew his brains out.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.530
You shot him in the head?

25:09.560 --> 25:11.480
Lights out, baby.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.280
JFK style.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.776
Back and to the
left, know what I'm saying?

25:15.800 --> 25:18.936
One shot to the chest.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.240
That's what killed
your friend Emilio.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.150
But he didn't die right
away It took time.

25:26.930 --> 25:30.040
Maybe 20 minutes.

25:30.750 --> 25:33.100
Bullet nicked his heart.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.776
Blood poured into his lungs.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.886
- Remember, Tomas?
- No.

25:37.910 --> 25:40.110
He would have had
trouble breathing.

25:40.140 --> 25:42.640
The pain must have
been excruciating.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.026
But you know all this
don't you, Marine?

25:44.050 --> 25:46.117
I wasn't there.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.006
Popeye didn't pop the guy.

25:52.030 --> 25:54.300
No way a kid like that
took down two Marines.

25:54.340 --> 25:57.396
Probably taking credit for a
street kill to elevate his stature.

25:57.420 --> 25:58.826
Get anything on PFC Tamayo?

25:58.850 --> 26:00.826
- He's scared.
- He's hiding something.

26:00.850 --> 26:01.966
They both are.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.810
Something more going on than that.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.126
You're right, probie.

26:05.150 --> 26:07.266
Gangbangers don't
kidnap their enemies.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.536
They shoot them in the street.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.900
Somebody's pulling
strings, calling shots

26:10.930 --> 26:12.420
I think I know who

26:12.450 --> 26:15.940
I've been crosschecking the Metro Gang
Task Force's list of known PC members

26:15.970 --> 26:18.060
against cell numbers
registered in their names.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.860
One common phone
number keeps popping up.

26:19.900 --> 26:21.725
It's a number from outside
the neighborhood.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.351
That called almost every member
of the PC gang.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.720
That's the COfrom
the shooting range.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.590
Staff sergeant Vicente Medina.

26:29.620 --> 26:32.176
That's not all I looked into
the staff sergeant's history.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.646
It seems he shares a bit more
than phone records in common.

26:35.670 --> 26:38.806
He wasn't just
recruiting from the PCs.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.030
He was a member.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.710
Get him in here.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.816
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Meet you in my office

26:46.840 --> 26:48.720
I'll be right there.

26:50.430 --> 26:53.150
Marine file - It's yours.

26:53.690 --> 26:57.030
I haven't read it yet, and I
won't if you'd prefer I didn't.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.713
I thought it might shed some light
on what the hell happened in Colombia

27:00.737 --> 27:03.754
18 years ago
unless you'd prefer to.

27:05.620 --> 27:07.236
I got nothing to hide, Leon.

27:07.260 --> 27:09.980
Everybody's got something to hide.

27:12.070 --> 27:14.240
Franks a part of this?

27:14.270 --> 27:16.400
A little part.

27:21.530 --> 27:24.670
Some good stuff in
the last five pages.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.400
How many men have you killed?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.780
Seven confirmed.

27:41.810 --> 27:43.566
Where?

27:43.590 --> 27:48.890
Three in Anbar, two in Fallouja, one
in Baghdad, one in Tora Bora.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.150
How about Washington, DC?

27:53.700 --> 27:54.940
None.

27:54.980 --> 27:58.286
You knew Emilio Salazar?

27:58.310 --> 27:59.830
His platoon sergeant, sir.

27:59.860 --> 28:02.590
He's a gang member
just like you are.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.590
That was a long time ago.

28:04.630 --> 28:05.916
That was last night!

28:05.940 --> 28:07.680
Sir, I did not kill that Marine!

28:07.720 --> 28:10.010
Whatwereyou doing last night?

28:10.040 --> 28:12.716
I was at home watching TV.

28:12.740 --> 28:15.910
Anybody watching you watching TV?

28:16.790 --> 28:18.050
No.

28:18.100 --> 28:22.450
Your place is 20 minutes
from our crime scene.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.456
Phone records.

28:25.480 --> 28:30.220
You made contact with half the
PC posse over the past six months.

28:32.690 --> 28:35.666
Rap sheet; Yours.

28:35.690 --> 28:39.160
Shot caller for the
PCs for three years.

28:40.350 --> 28:43.596
Once a Marine, always a Marine.

28:43.620 --> 28:47.076
Or once a PC, always a PC

28:47.100 --> 28:49.766
I lived the life
It's not a secret

28:49.790 --> 28:53.307
I liked it, till I saw what
was happening to my friends.

28:53.342 --> 28:58.666
In dead or jail by 17
so I joined the Marine Corps.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.607
Made me a better person
came back to the hood.

29:00.642 --> 29:03.354
And tried to convince others
to make something of themselves.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.060
Ran a system-wide facial
recognition search

29:12.090 --> 29:14.740
I thought you'd want
to see this right away.

29:20.590 --> 29:23.130
Okay, let's try this again
Where were you last night?

29:24.160 --> 29:26.870
I... I told you I was at home

29:27.240 --> 29:30.376
Baltimore! That was
taken last night!

29:30.400 --> 29:32.100
You couldn't have killed him.

29:32.130 --> 29:34.460
Why are you lying?

29:37.590 --> 29:40.640
I went to visit my son.

29:41.300 --> 29:43.110
When I was 15, I made some mistakes

29:43.140 --> 29:46.710
I got a girl pregnant
And my wife

29:49.550 --> 29:52.280
she doesn't know I have a kid.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.650
I know what we got; Nothing.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.880
Guess we all make
mistakes, huh, probie?

30:08.120 --> 30:11.256
Got two Marines chained
to a roof Don't know why.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.986
Got somebody behind it pulling
strings Don't know who.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.339
Can we wind the clock back
to the part.

30:15.363 --> 30:17.609
Where we find out what
Gibbs was doing in Colombia?

30:17.644 --> 30:19.530
Or how it is connected to the gang?

30:19.560 --> 30:22.810
Got a punk who didn't kill
anybody who says he did,

30:22.840 --> 30:26.940
and a kid who wrote probie's service
number in blood saying he didn't.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.396
You done?

30:28.420 --> 30:31.086
Done watching you shave
with a butter knife.

30:31.110 --> 30:32.500
Let me talk to that kid

30:32.550 --> 30:34.730
I'll get him to tell us what
the hell's going on here

30:34.770 --> 30:36.810
I can't do that, Mike I let him go.

30:37.260 --> 30:38.120
You what?

30:38.150 --> 30:39.966
If you want to find
something, you follow it

30:39.990 --> 30:42.240
I learned that one from you.

30:45.020 --> 30:47.060
You two.

30:47.990 --> 30:51.030
MTAC with McGee - Got it, boss.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.916
Think I don't know
what you're doing?

31:06.940 --> 31:08.940
Trying to get that boy off?

31:08.970 --> 31:11.680
Yeah, gonna lead us to the truth.

31:11.710 --> 31:12.790
The truth.

31:12.820 --> 31:16.810
Yeah, which you should
have told me 17 years ago.

31:20.490 --> 31:25.130
When I got Rose out of Colombia, you
were happily married again.

31:25.170 --> 31:28.120
- Or so I thought.
- What's the truth?

31:28.780 --> 31:32.090
The truth is, she
didn't want you to know!

31:33.910 --> 31:36.790
She knew you were still putting
the pieces back together.

31:36.825 --> 31:38.619
After Shannon and Kelly.

31:39.250 --> 31:42.250
Didn't want to
complicate your life.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.590
Guess she didn't get
her wish after all.

31:47.550 --> 31:50.760
Maybe Gibbs was on a covert mission
to suppress the Fujimori coup.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.600
That was Peru, not Colombia.

31:54.050 --> 31:58.950
Okay, boss, we're still following the
GPS signal from PFC Tamayo's cell phone.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.950
He drove to Quantico He's
been there about 20 minutes.

32:08.770 --> 32:10.630
Quantico's that way, probie.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.446
We're not going to Quantico That's
his first stop We're going to his last.

32:14.470 --> 32:17.236
Like the lady
said, Mike "It's a war".

32:17.260 --> 32:20.110
So he's down in Colombia in Bogota.

32:20.150 --> 32:21.960
He saves President Clinton's life,

32:22.000 --> 32:24.870
but nobody can talk about
it because it's super secret

32:24.900 --> 32:27.080
Clinton did not serve until '93.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.090
Stop obsessing!

32:28.120 --> 32:30.506
I'm not obsessing! I'm
a little preoccupied

32:30.530 --> 32:35.040
I'm a tad fascinated by the whole
subject, but I amnot obsessing.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.200
What was he doing in
Colombia 17 years ago?

32:39.240 --> 32:42.766
18 years ago- and
it's classified, DiNozzo.

32:42.790 --> 32:46.500
Is that classified, too, or can
you share with your director?

32:47.600 --> 32:50.450
We're, uh, tracking a
suspect for Gibbs, Director

32:50.480 --> 32:52.770
Franks is with him?

32:54.980 --> 32:56.336
That's what I thought.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.500
PFC Tamayo's just left Quantico.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.230
He's now headed
towards Liberty Heights.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.426
So, what do you want us to do?

33:01.450 --> 33:04.086
Whatever you were doing
before I walked in.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.406
What's Tamayo's duty
assignment at Quantico?

33:06.430 --> 33:07.900
Guard duty at the base armory.

33:07.930 --> 33:08.850
And the dead Marine?

33:08.900 --> 33:12.116
PFC Salazar was also
a guard at the armory.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.826
Means they both had
access to the armory codes.

33:14.850 --> 33:16.626
Stepping back Excuse me.

33:16.650 --> 33:19.030
- Get base security on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

33:21.720 --> 33:26.270
Hey, if this kid starts shooting
you're gonna shoot back, right?

33:31.750 --> 33:34.480
This is a really bad time, Leon

33:34.510 --> 33:37.360
I just got off the phone with
the Armory OICat Quantico.

33:37.390 --> 33:40.020
Four crates of M-4
assault rifles are missing.

33:40.050 --> 33:42.370
That's your PFC Tamayo, Gibbs.

33:42.410 --> 33:44.906
Gangs, guns It adds up.

33:44.930 --> 33:47.260
We're still monitoring his GPS.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.466
- He's headed back toward the projects.
- The projects?

33:49.490 --> 33:52.070
Yeah, we got him, we got him.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.566
I did what you wanted, okay?

34:02.590 --> 34:04.156
No, you listen to me!

34:04.180 --> 34:05.430
You want 'em, you come get 'em.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.670
Second floor-I'm waiting.

34:08.020 --> 34:10.770
This is about to get
real interesting, probie.

34:15.550 --> 34:18.290
McGee, building across the street.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.246
Traffic camera, 3837 Ashton.

34:21.270 --> 34:24.020
Got it - Record it.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.150
Recording.

34:43.810 --> 34:45.766
You alone, homes?

34:45.790 --> 34:47.735
Zoom in on those guys.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.815
In Those two.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.230
Aren't those the two guys?

34:52.270 --> 34:55.326
Chuy and Rico I should
have hit them harder.

34:55.350 --> 34:56.485
You got 'em?

34:56.510 --> 35:00.716
Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Put your hands
in the air! Put your hands in the air!

35:00.740 --> 35:03.920
You thought you were gonna use
Marine guns to kill my friends?

35:03.950 --> 35:05.090
Something's going down.

35:05.130 --> 35:06.110
Somebody's behind him

35:06.140 --> 35:08.270
McGee, zoom out, zoom out.

35:11.010 --> 35:13.400
No! This ends here!

35:17.900 --> 35:19.940
What the hell?

35:29.890 --> 35:31.190
Don't move, Sergeant

35:32.610 --> 35:35.170
DiNozzo, call for an
ambulance and backup.

35:40.290 --> 35:44.486
Everywhere you
go, kid, somebody gets shot

35:44.510 --> 35:48.106
3832 Ashton shots fired
Possible multiple casualties.

35:48.130 --> 35:50.500
Keep pressure on it, Sergeant.

35:55.380 --> 35:56.690
Hey, Leon.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.690
Let me talk to him.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.836
He's busy Can I take a message?

35:59.860 --> 36:01.590
You just shot somebody, Franks.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.126
Yeah All by the book, Leon.

36:04.150 --> 36:06.590
Retired-agent-involved shooting.

36:06.620 --> 36:09.040
That's still a form KJ-65, right?

36:09.070 --> 36:11.810
- Nice talking to you, Leon.
- Fra.

36:13.710 --> 36:15.990
It was me.

36:16.790 --> 36:18.784
I ordered him to take those weapons
off the base.

36:18.819 --> 36:20.137
And bring 'em here like they wanted.

36:20.161 --> 36:21.460
Why?

36:21.490 --> 36:24.190
- Because I was.
- No, not you You.

36:25.940 --> 36:28.596
They held me on the roof.

36:28.620 --> 36:32.336
Said they'd hurt everyone I love
unless I got them the assault weapons.

36:32.360 --> 36:33.710
I... I didn't believe them.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.296
They used to be my friends.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.870
Then they threatened Emilio.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.240
Shot him in front of me.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.320
I thought they were
gonna kill me, too.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.110
That why you wrote
my service number?

36:47.200 --> 36:49.666
When I found out you were
NCIS, I wanted to tell you, but

36:49.690 --> 36:51.770
I ordered him not to.

36:53.560 --> 36:54.870
Why?

36:54.910 --> 36:57.637
Using Marine guns
to kill kids in my hood.

36:57.672 --> 37:00.365
Kids I was trying to save
it made me sick.

37:01.460 --> 37:04.770
I wanted to handle it myself.

37:06.150 --> 37:09.310
We take care of our own.

37:17.140 --> 37:19.996
Those guys are just the hired help.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.896
- That is all you have to say?
- Yes

37:22.920 --> 37:25.546
I did it, I admit it I'll
give you a full confession.

37:25.570 --> 37:27.616
Can I talk to him?

37:27.640 --> 37:29.110
No, he's going to prison.

37:29.150 --> 37:29.846
Please, I.

37:29.870 --> 37:33.316
He stole weapons from a Marine
base to arm a street gang.

37:33.340 --> 37:35.560
People died.

37:36.050 --> 37:38.510
He confessed to everything.

37:38.540 --> 37:41.110
All of it, his idea.

37:41.870 --> 37:44.560
And he's going away.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.980
Unless you've got something to say.

37:52.720 --> 37:56.860
Wait He didn't do
anything He's lying.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.440
Hold up.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.250
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

38:05.290 --> 38:08.866
They were supposed to scare them so
that Tomas or Emilio would get the guns.

38:08.890 --> 38:12.186
For the PC's Emilio
wasn't supposed to get shot.

38:12.210 --> 38:15.410
That was an accident, I swear.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.080
Who need weapons, Maggie?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.790
Our kids.

38:19.820 --> 38:22.050
In the neighborhood, on our block.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.690
They were getting killed every day.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.440
Slaughtered by drug
dealers and bigger gangs.

38:27.490 --> 38:30.610
They are dying every day!

38:31.600 --> 38:32.980
I had to protect them.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.710
By what, arming them
with assault rifles?

38:35.750 --> 38:37.120
I grew up in the Cold War.

38:37.170 --> 38:38.490
My dad talked about deterrence-

38:38.530 --> 38:42.880
if you build up an arsenal that rivals
your enemy's, they won't attack you.

38:45.270 --> 38:47.900
You understand?

39:05.880 --> 39:09.650
Case closed-my
case, and you being on it.

39:11.280 --> 39:15.250
"Melinda 555-0199."

39:16.530 --> 39:18.750
Hold the phone, Malone, I
know that number.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.740
You should-it's
your dentist's office.

39:20.780 --> 39:22.780
They rescheduled your appointment.

39:22.830 --> 39:24.660
Ooh, thatMelinda.

39:24.690 --> 39:27.146
The one with the man hands.

39:27.170 --> 39:29.410
Well, I hope you
learned a lesson, probie.

39:29.440 --> 39:32.216
Yeah-never to pick
up your phone again.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.706
Wait a second.

39:34.730 --> 39:37.080
It was right in front
of me the whole time

39:38.340 --> 39:40.656
Franks! I've got
a question for you.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.126
Got a plane to catch

39:43.150 --> 39:45.380
18 years ago, Colombia

39:45.420 --> 39:47.730
Gibbs was doing drug
interdiction down there

39:47.770 --> 39:49.960
Tomas is 18, from Colombia.

39:49.990 --> 39:53.160
Knows Gibbs's Marine
service number.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.900
Question?

39:54.930 --> 39:57.486
Is Gibbs Tomas's father?

39:57.510 --> 40:01.360
Tell probie thanks for the lend.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.460
No Sit down As you were.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.016
Your orders.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.740
Shipping out to Afghanistan.

40:16.610 --> 40:19.180
I... I'm not going to jail?

40:21.120 --> 40:24.170
You helped the investigation.

40:30.150 --> 40:33.240
My mother used to tell me
this story about a Marine.

40:35.590 --> 40:38.810
He came to help out our village.

40:40.410 --> 40:43.350
But the drug cartel
came after him

40:44.710 --> 40:47.270
shot him He almost died.

40:53.010 --> 40:56.670
She hid him, helped him heal.

41:08.370 --> 41:10.836
That was you.

41:10.860 --> 41:13.666
And when you finally got well

41:13.690 --> 41:16.210
you told her that if
she ever need any help,

41:16.240 --> 41:19.840
she could give that number to
any Marine and you would find her.

41:21.620 --> 41:24.950
She made me memorize that number.

41:26.240 --> 41:29.410
You're the reason
I became a Marine.

41:40.050 --> 41:44.390
When your mother saved my life, she
was already pregnant with you.

41:51.020 --> 41:53.800
Most people, they don't
get a second chance.

41:59.650 --> 42:01.680
Good luck.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.930
Semper Fi.

42:07.810 --> 42:10.410
Ooh-rah.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.331
Read about the mission
to eliminate Cesar Castillo.

42:16.366 --> 42:18.435
From the Cali Cartel in Colombia.

42:19.140 --> 42:20.460
Good read?

42:20.490 --> 42:22.866
It was impressive.

42:22.890 --> 42:27.000
Took out your target with one
shot to the heart from 1, 200 yards.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.260
This Castillo was a piece of work.

42:29.290 --> 42:33.470
Drug dealer, torturer, rapist.

42:33.940 --> 42:35.520
I did my job.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.520
And the mission would've gone
off without a hitch.

42:37.922 --> 42:39.962
If you hadn't been wounded.

42:40.650 --> 42:44.656
Well, I guess you're
all caught up now, Leon.

42:44.680 --> 42:48.890
Must've been poignant helping out the
son of the woman that saved your life.

42:50.570 --> 42:53.930
Did you tell the boy that the
man you killed was his father?
