00:08.720 --> 00:11.824
I don't want
no English glitter prince.

00:11.871 --> 00:12.913
What do you think?

00:13.205 --> 00:14.832
And while
you're entertaining them...

00:14.877 --> 00:16.894
we'll stick our nose
into their business.

your friends are in trouble.

00:24.842 --> 00:26.218
I think you should
go and help them.

00:27.085 --> 00:28.581
We give up!
We give up!

00:28.636 --> 00:30.222

02:27.714 --> 02:32.219
Yeah, you see this whole thing is
just a simple matter of economics.

02:32.344 --> 02:35.055
I took couple of night
courses last semester.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.808
Boy, I wanna tell you what a
difference that has made.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.184
See, Murdock...

02:39.977 --> 02:41.228
Murdock.

02:42.662 --> 02:47.150
Creative accounting is just like
any other applied art form, see?

02:47.317 --> 02:48.610
Understanding debits
and credits.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.029
Understanding where
you can gain the edge...

02:51.113 --> 02:55.158
by calling something an expense
instead of a direct cost.

02:55.284 --> 02:57.828
Now, this deal that I've set up
at The Floor 'Em is a classic.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.664
I mean, classic case in point.

03:01.957 --> 03:03.542
Murdock, am I boring you, hmm?

03:03.625 --> 03:04.751
'Cause I can stop, you know.

03:04.835 --> 03:07.504
I'm just trying to tell you how you're
gonna make a couple hundred grand.

03:07.587 --> 03:08.755
That's all I'm trying to do.

03:08.839 --> 03:11.049
- Boy, I see what you mean, Face.
- Yeah.

03:11.174 --> 03:13.135
You weren't even listening.
You were sound asleep.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.262
You just tried
to explain to me...

03:15.345 --> 03:17.389
how you was gonna cheat
this guy at the roadhouse.

03:17.472 --> 03:19.558
Not a roadhouse, Murdock.
It's an auditorium.

03:19.683 --> 03:22.394
I am an artists'
booking agent, right?

03:22.477 --> 03:24.896
Wrong. You're a scam agent
booking artists.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.273
Same thing.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.067
Now, look, my buddy at
Peach Pear Management...

03:29.151 --> 03:31.737
has told me that if I can
guarantee him a full house...

03:31.903 --> 03:34.239
he is gonna send me...
Ready?

03:34.406 --> 03:35.991
Cowboy George...

03:36.116 --> 03:38.785
for a weekend gig. Can you believe it?
Cowboy George.

03:38.869 --> 03:40.203
Who is Cowboy George?

03:40.287 --> 03:42.789
Am I hearing this right?
Don't you listen to the radio?

03:42.873 --> 03:45.792
I don't need to. I already got lots
of pretty music inside my head.

03:45.917 --> 03:46.668
Yeah.

03:46.752 --> 03:50.172
The song <i>Three Blind Mice</i> sung by the
Lennon Sisters is going through my head.

03:50.255 --> 03:52.632
I need a change.
It's beginning to bug me.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.426
Well, you're going
to get your chance...

03:54.509 --> 03:56.887
because tomorrow
Cowboy George...

03:57.054 --> 03:59.514
and the Range Rats are going
to play at The Floor 'Em...

03:59.598 --> 04:04.394
and they're going to make the
A-Team $300,000 in profits.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.670
So, we gonna cut
a fat deal, huh, Face?

04:30.796 --> 04:34.800
Right. Gonna guarantee the
house, take 100% of the profits.

04:34.925 --> 04:37.010
No house split.
That's important, see...

04:37.094 --> 04:39.471
'cause nightclub owner,
they can beat you at the gate.

04:39.638 --> 04:41.306
Boy, have I got this game down.

04:41.390 --> 04:44.059
I'm so glad
I took that night course.

04:59.783 --> 05:01.535
Excuse me, boys, I'm...

05:01.701 --> 05:02.494
How you doing?

05:02.577 --> 05:04.287
I'm looking for Chuck Danford.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.622
We're closed.

05:05.914 --> 05:08.250
Ah, listen,
I'm Templeton Peck...

05:08.333 --> 05:10.085
of Peach Pear Artists'
Management.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.879
Yeah, I believe I spoke with you
the other day about my client.

05:12.963 --> 05:15.132
It's Cowboy George
and the Range Rats.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.801
No kiddin'.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.053
- How do, how do?
- How do?

05:20.137 --> 05:23.098
- Chuck Danford.
- Oh, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuckie.

05:23.432 --> 05:25.100
Remmey St. Starland here.

05:26.112 --> 05:27.811
That's a funny name.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.147
Thank you.
Made it up myself.

05:32.023 --> 05:35.652
Well, when's old Cowboy George
gonna bust on in here?

05:35.777 --> 05:38.530
Tomorrow. Yeah,
we at Peach Pear Management...

05:38.613 --> 05:40.449
I tell you, we're real glad
to get your call.

05:40.532 --> 05:41.950
Yes, and I'm telling you...

05:42.242 --> 05:45.203
Cowboy George is gonna
fill this place up.

05:45.704 --> 05:46.663
He better.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.540
Yeah, of course I'm
four-walling this deal...

05:48.623 --> 05:51.001
on a minimum guarantee
of $25,000.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.211
That's against a guaranteed
100% of the house.

05:53.295 --> 05:57.632
Now, you keep the overrides on all
concessions with a 20% kickback to us.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.511
I don't rightly understand
a word you're saying, mister.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.723
We talkin' Hollywood talk,
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuckie.

06:04.806 --> 06:07.392
And he's using
a stardust dialect.

06:07.517 --> 06:08.935
What I'm saying here, Chuck...

06:09.060 --> 06:12.731
is this is an envelope, see,
with $20,000 in it.

06:12.814 --> 06:14.316
That rents The Floor 'Em
for a day.

06:14.441 --> 06:18.028
I take the gate, and you get
80% of drinks and sandwiches.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.071
Good. That was the deal.

06:20.197 --> 06:21.573
Why didn't you just say that?

06:21.698 --> 06:22.616
I did.

06:22.741 --> 06:23.992
You guys work it out, okay?

06:24.075 --> 06:25.535
I'll prep the docs...

06:25.619 --> 06:28.663
then we'll ink the pad and skyrocket
out of here. How about it?

06:32.834 --> 06:34.044
What's he sayin'?

06:34.127 --> 06:37.964
Oh, prepare the documents,
sign the deal and leave.

06:38.048 --> 06:39.216
Why didn't he say that?

06:39.341 --> 06:40.342
He did.

06:40.425 --> 06:42.385
- Ah, just a minute.
- Yeah.

06:42.469 --> 06:45.597
Uh, the boys on this
pipeline are rough.

06:45.764 --> 06:47.849
Now, you don't give 'em
Cowboy George...

06:48.308 --> 06:49.601
they'll kill you.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.402
Just you watch, Murdock,
timing, good business sense...

06:59.486 --> 07:03.323
with a little tricky accounting
is gonna make us rich.

07:03.406 --> 07:05.951
- What now?
- Pickup Cowboy George.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.494
He's comin' out on
the plane from Phoenix.

07:07.577 --> 07:09.797
Should be into the Dry
Creek Airport in about...

07:09.922 --> 07:11.748
- 15 minutes?
- Right.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.426
Well, I guess you're right,
Face...

07:23.552 --> 07:25.303
I mean, as long as we can get
that Cowboy George.

07:25.387 --> 07:27.764
What do you mean, "As long
as we get Cowboy George"?

07:27.847 --> 07:29.182
We got him, all right?

07:29.266 --> 07:33.311
Listen, my very good friend Dashiel
Goldman represents him, okay?

07:33.436 --> 07:36.982
After all, I'm getting a 50-50
cut on this weekend gig.

07:37.148 --> 07:38.817
You mean this guy...

07:38.942 --> 07:42.237
is gonna give you this hot act just
so that you can make all this money?

07:42.320 --> 07:46.533
Yeah, see, I helped him out with a little
scrape he had with his ex-wife last year.

07:46.741 --> 07:49.244
Yeah, anyway, the deal is done.
Don't worry.

07:49.327 --> 07:51.288
Cowboy George is ours.

07:51.580 --> 07:52.914
I don't see him.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.379
Uh, Cowboy George?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.131
Yo, Cowboy George?

08:01.298 --> 08:03.592
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Templeton Peck...

08:03.675 --> 08:05.218
from Peach Pear Management.
Is that you?

08:05.343 --> 08:07.053
Uh, yeah, that's me.

08:07.137 --> 08:08.722
I'm looking for Cowboy George.

08:08.847 --> 08:10.724
Well, I'm almost him.
I'm Boy George. Hi.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.267
Dash Goldman sent me out
to meet you here.

08:12.350 --> 08:13.893
You picked up the
guarantee on my contract.

08:13.977 --> 08:16.146
We're heading
for the last roundup.

08:16.771 --> 08:17.897
What are you trying to say, man?

08:17.981 --> 08:20.233
Wait a minute, see, I agreed...

08:20.317 --> 08:22.277
to book Cowboy George...

08:22.485 --> 08:25.071
Well, I'm Boy George and I agreed
to play the Arizona Forum.

08:25.196 --> 08:26.031
Forum?

08:26.114 --> 08:27.907
Oh, well,
there is no Forum here.

08:28.033 --> 08:31.369
I mean, this is a barn, it's a dance hall.
It's called The Floor 'Em.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.913
Guys with broken noses,
they drink there...

08:33.996 --> 08:35.832
hit each other over the head
with table legs...

08:35.914 --> 08:37.207
It's not your--

08:37.667 --> 08:39.376
But Dash Goldman told me
you picked up my contract...

08:39.461 --> 08:42.672
that you would guarantee me 60% of
what I earned at my last gig...

08:42.756 --> 08:44.090
which was at, you know,
Madison Square Gardens.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.550
Like $2 million, man.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.637
Dash Goldman ducked and we
took the bullet in the chest.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.514
Uh, let me get
this straight now. I...

08:51.931 --> 08:55.018
owe you 60% of $2 million.

08:56.478 --> 08:57.979
Uh, uh...

08:58.271 --> 09:01.524
Yeah, well, let's see, now,
that's $1.2 million.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.401
That's right.
I mean, pay or play, man.

09:03.485 --> 09:05.445
I tell you what,
let's go look at the place.

09:05.570 --> 09:08.070
Let's go and look at the hall 'cause I
wouldn't mind seeing what it's like, you know.

09:08.121 --> 09:09.623
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

09:17.248 --> 09:19.292
You gotta be kiddin'.

09:19.751 --> 09:22.587
They don't want no English rock
star with eyeball glitter.

09:22.712 --> 09:24.089
This is a tough crowd.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.799
Look, I don't wanna
hear from you, all right?

09:25.882 --> 09:27.008
You got your $20,000.

09:27.092 --> 09:27.967
You're out of it.

09:28.093 --> 09:30.762
It's not your problem, Chuck.

09:32.514 --> 09:33.598
Now, look...

09:33.640 --> 09:36.810
I wanted Cowboy George. You said
you'd deliver Cowboy George.

09:36.935 --> 09:38.770
Now, I gotta fill this place,
you understand?

09:38.895 --> 09:40.105
What do you care?

09:40.230 --> 09:41.773
I rented the hall.

09:41.856 --> 09:43.817
Look, I got bigger problems, Chuck.
Okay?

09:43.900 --> 09:45.276
Now, get lost.

09:51.366 --> 09:54.452
Okay, partner, let me
say this so you hear...

09:54.953 --> 09:57.163
I want Cowboy George.

09:57.372 --> 10:00.458
I don't want
no English glitter prince.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.378
Now, Cowboy George shows up...

10:03.837 --> 10:08.216
or you show up in a concrete bathrobe
at the bottom of Frazier Dam.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.801
Yeah, well, I...

10:10.009 --> 10:11.469
Let him loose, Chuckie.

10:11.761 --> 10:14.764
Besides inking pads
and skying here and there...

10:15.348 --> 10:18.268
I also like to blow holes
in the heads of rednecks.

10:21.771 --> 10:22.772
Excuse me.

10:22.897 --> 10:26.401
I can't play this place because
it's a certified toilet.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.529
Toilet?
Could we discuss this outside?

10:29.738 --> 10:32.365
Actually, I don't think
it's so bad...

10:35.660 --> 10:36.995
We're in trouble.

10:37.287 --> 10:40.457
Call Kurt in Twin Rivers
and tell him we got a problem.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.041
Kurt ain't gonna like it.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.877
Armored car comes in tomorrow.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.170
Look, it ain't my fault.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.671
I called
the management company...

10:46.796 --> 10:48.131
I booked Cowboy George...

10:48.214 --> 10:50.842
and some turkey in a
sequined coat shows up.

10:50.925 --> 10:52.385
Well, that's Boy George.

10:52.510 --> 10:54.721
He's a big top 40
rock and roll star.

10:54.846 --> 10:57.098
And he won't draw flies
in this valley.

10:57.182 --> 10:58.516
Now, get on the phone.

11:00.185 --> 11:03.855
What do you mean,
you've "got Boy George"?

11:03.980 --> 11:07.192
Just what I told you.
Dash Goldman stiffed me.

11:07.317 --> 11:08.485
Well, he didn't stiff you.

11:08.568 --> 11:11.696
Boy George is 100 times
the act that Cowboy George is.

11:11.821 --> 11:15.658
Yeah, well, let's just say that there
are some contractual inadequacies...

11:15.742 --> 11:17.744
that make this deal
less than perfect, okay?

11:17.827 --> 11:19.037
Besides...

11:20.288 --> 11:21.915
well, there's...

11:22.040 --> 11:23.917
I think there's something
going on down here.

11:24.042 --> 11:26.085
I told you, this guy
threatened to kill me.

11:26.169 --> 11:29.339
What for? You rented his
joint, you gave him $20,000.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.382
My point, exactly.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.302
I got Murdock following
one of his henchmen.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.631
Hey, Hannibal, why's Face out
here spending our money?

12:53.715 --> 12:54.883
It ain't right.

12:55.133 --> 12:57.969
Ever since he took that show
business accounting course...

12:58.094 --> 13:00.221
he's been in
the fiscal twilight zone.

13:00.305 --> 13:01.806
That Dash Golden dude...

13:01.931 --> 13:04.475
I wouldn't let him hold my wallet
if I had a gun trained on him.

13:04.559 --> 13:05.810
Yeah, he's pretty slippery.

13:05.935 --> 13:08.021
Face is trying to get
something going between jobs.

13:08.146 --> 13:09.898
And we all got
our outside interests.

13:09.981 --> 13:14.193
You got your daycare center, Murdock's
got his psychosis, I got my acting.

13:14.277 --> 13:15.528
Hannibal, you ain't no actor.

13:15.612 --> 13:17.906
You don't find actors
dressing up like lizards.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.491
That's a very narrow
interpretation, B.A.

13:20.575 --> 13:22.118
Boris Karloff wouldn't like it.

13:22.243 --> 13:25.163
Now, imagine me
with a wig and a hat.

13:25.830 --> 13:26.956
How do I look?

13:27.498 --> 13:28.708
Pretty good.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.169
Chuck wagon chili
on a honey roll, son.

13:31.294 --> 13:34.672
That's the turn off up there. We got
to meet Face at the Adobe Inn, Room 6.

13:46.726 --> 13:49.646
Oh, boy, am I glad you're here.

13:49.812 --> 13:52.690
You look...
Hey, that's terrific.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.233
How you doing, B.A.?

13:54.317 --> 13:57.487
Terrible, man. Hannibal tells me
you're out here wasting our money.

13:57.612 --> 14:00.281
Well, I'm... That's a very
narrow interpretation of it.

14:00.365 --> 14:01.658
Everybody keeps saying that...

14:01.783 --> 14:04.953
but I'm still waiting for your explanation
to what happened to our $20,000.

14:05.119 --> 14:07.914
Well, let's not stand
around outside. Come on in.

14:10.667 --> 14:11.751
Uh, George...

14:11.918 --> 14:15.046
George, I'd like to introduce you
to some very good friends of mine.

14:15.129 --> 14:16.172
This is Hannibal Smith.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.215
- How do you do?
- Hi, how are you doing?

14:17.298 --> 14:19.467
- And B.A. Baracus.
- Hi.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.970
This place is really American.

14:22.053 --> 14:24.472
But I think the people will like
us once they hear the music.

14:24.555 --> 14:26.432
Boy George. Wow.

14:26.557 --> 14:27.684
How are you?

14:30.687 --> 14:32.146
How you doing, Murdock?

14:32.313 --> 14:33.856
These Lennon Sisters...

14:33.940 --> 14:36.651
they just won't stop
singing in my head.

14:36.985 --> 14:40.989
Will you cut it out, girls, and
give this mice song some time off?

14:41.155 --> 14:42.573
What's he talking about, Face?

14:42.699 --> 14:46.869
Yeah, well, he's got a
song stuck in his head.

14:47.370 --> 14:48.705
Murdock...

14:48.871 --> 14:52.000
will you tell Hannibal about the building,
the guys with the machine guns?

14:52.083 --> 14:56.337
I followed this cowboy to a building
about 10 miles out of town.

14:56.671 --> 15:00.466
And they have M60s
mounted on a jeep.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.844
I couldn't overhear
everything...

15:03.177 --> 15:06.097
because these girls are making
so much racket in my head.

15:06.222 --> 15:07.390
Something's going on here,
Hannibal.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.517
I been running this thing
around in my head and...

15:09.642 --> 15:10.852
well, one thing's for sure.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.271
They want Cowboy George
to play at The Floor 'Em...

15:13.354 --> 15:16.607
to draw in all those cowboys who've
been out working on the pipeline.

15:16.691 --> 15:20.236
You know, now for some reason, they don't
think that Boy George here can draw...

15:20.319 --> 15:22.822
the country-western audience. That's
why they're trying to kill me.

15:22.905 --> 15:25.366
Why they need to fill that
auditorium, I don't know.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.869
Why don't we go on down to The Floor
'Em and tell Chuck Danford...

15:27.952 --> 15:29.787
that Cowboy George has arrived.

15:30.121 --> 15:32.290
Well, that's great, you guys,
but I came here to sing.

15:32.373 --> 15:34.876
Oh, you'll sing. You'll be
the opening act for me.

15:35.043 --> 15:36.544
And while
you're entertaining them...

15:36.627 --> 15:38.880
we'll stick our nose
into their business.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.423
Whatever it is.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.841
Yeah, well, I feel
really bad about this...

15:41.924 --> 15:44.093
because you guys have gotta
give me $1.2 million.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.553
And I've seen that hall.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.764
Five quid a head,
you ain't gonna make it.

15:47.847 --> 15:49.640
This is a bad deal.

15:49.724 --> 15:50.558
Face.

15:50.641 --> 15:53.061
Yeah, that was the kicker.

15:53.311 --> 15:54.812
Yeah, but I've been so busy...

15:54.896 --> 15:58.066
I haven't had a chance to explain
our little contractual divot here.

15:58.149 --> 16:01.360
Face, $1.2 million
is not a divot...

16:01.444 --> 16:02.487
it is a crater.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.280
All right, girls, girls,
girls, be quiet.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.240
The big kids are trying
to talk here now.

16:06.365 --> 16:09.702
See, he was so busy counting
the money in his head...

16:09.827 --> 16:11.913
he failed to read the fine
print in the contract...

16:11.996 --> 16:14.916
which said that
acts could be substituted.

16:14.999 --> 16:17.919
My copy of the contract
was smudged.

16:19.170 --> 16:20.797
Yeah, well, I just...

16:20.922 --> 16:22.632
You know, when you do
business with people...

16:22.715 --> 16:25.676
there's a certain degree of trust
that's involved in the deal.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.847
Face, how could you trust
a guy named Dash?

16:29.931 --> 16:32.100
You see, he owes me
a little favor...

16:32.183 --> 16:34.894
'cause I helped him out
with his ex-wife.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.271
Yeah.

16:37.480 --> 16:41.567
Look, it just never occurred to me that
he'd knife me in the back on this thing.

16:41.692 --> 16:44.320
This is terrible. I mean, I hate to
see you guys get stuck with this...

16:44.445 --> 16:47.281
you know, but I think this Mr.
Goldman's a bit of a pirate.

16:47.365 --> 16:49.075
You know, maybe we can work
something out.

16:49.158 --> 16:50.618
Well, George, George...

16:50.701 --> 16:53.454
George, you really are
one of the great ones.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.039
Well, I'll talk to
the rest of the guys...

16:55.123 --> 16:57.125
and maybe we can cut the guarantee
in half... or something.

16:57.291 --> 16:59.085
Half?
Half.

16:59.168 --> 17:00.586
$600,000?

17:00.962 --> 17:03.548
Ah, gee, that's very
generous of you, George.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.800
But, you see, to be
perfectly frank, I mean...

17:06.884 --> 17:08.803
we're not gonna be able
to come up with that.

17:08.886 --> 17:11.347
You know,
we'd need a huge auditorium.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.308
We could do an outside concert, you know.
We can advertise on the TV.

17:14.433 --> 17:15.518
We can pull this off.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.563
I can do the radio gig. I'm primed
for the airwaves. I can do it, guys.

17:18.688 --> 17:19.646
Really, I can.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.731
I don't know.

17:20.815 --> 17:24.652
This valley, you know, it may not be keyed
to your audience demographics, George.

17:24.734 --> 17:26.570
Nonsense.
Everybody likes Culture Club.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.073
Hey, Face, he's right.
They're great.

17:30.408 --> 17:32.910
Well, it's time to go down
to The Floor 'Em...

17:32.994 --> 17:37.081
and have Cowboy George
lay his card on the bar.

17:42.211 --> 17:45.381
Got some warm beer and some
stale pretzels in this dump?

17:45.882 --> 17:47.842
Son of a gun...

17:48.050 --> 17:49.343
you did show.

17:49.427 --> 17:52.763
I was beginnin' to believe that bookin' agent
of yours was tryin' to pull a fast one.

17:52.889 --> 17:55.558
Better put the amps and the
heavy stuff on the stage.

17:56.017 --> 17:58.644
Cowboy George in the flesh.

17:58.811 --> 17:59.896
I just can't believe it.

17:59.979 --> 18:02.023
You gonna get
their blood pumpin'.

18:03.816 --> 18:07.278
And you must be that scuzzbucket
they call Chuck Danford.

18:07.486 --> 18:08.696
Hey, now...

18:09.071 --> 18:11.157
take it easy. Be nice.

18:11.282 --> 18:14.702
Mighty tough on my man,
Temp Peck.

18:15.286 --> 18:16.913
Yeah, well...

18:18.664 --> 18:20.458
I'll apologize, because of you.

18:20.625 --> 18:23.044
- Where is he?
- He's over at the radio station.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.713
Getting the ad campaign ready.

18:25.796 --> 18:27.089
<i>When we talked on the phone...</i>

18:27.173 --> 18:29.550
<i>you said that there would be
a guest DJ from Los Angeles.</i>

18:29.634 --> 18:31.219
<i>Now I held the spot open...</i>

18:31.302 --> 18:33.512
<i>because you said it would
be somebody on this list.</i>

18:33.596 --> 18:35.890
Right. Right, I know.

18:35.973 --> 18:39.477
I know. But, you see, that was
before I was in Phoenix...

18:39.560 --> 18:43.147
and I found out that Pecos
Bob Steel was available.

18:43.272 --> 18:46.651
That man has won the Country
Mike Award, three years running.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.612
Four.
I was runner up in 1980.

18:49.695 --> 18:53.115
But I lost to Spinnin' Jack
Spiner on Country 109.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.659
But I never should've lost to
Spiner 'cause he's nothing...

18:54.784 --> 18:56.035
but a Chiquita banana
with a straw hat.

18:56.118 --> 18:59.205
And I think he bought it. But then,
hey, how could you ever prove it?

18:59.455 --> 19:02.500
Yeah, right. So we're pretty
lucky to get Pecos Bob here...

19:02.583 --> 19:04.460
to do this little
afternoon guest stint.

19:04.585 --> 19:07.380
Uh, could you do a little
fast rap for me, please?

19:07.505 --> 19:09.924
Now you're cookin' the beef and rollin'
the leaf with the real Bob Steel...

19:10.007 --> 19:12.635
where yours truly, the caped crusader
of sound, gonna make it all happen.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.886
- I wanna take it to the border...
- That's fine.

19:13.970 --> 19:15.471
...where Kenny and Dolly are
gonna light up the night...

19:15.554 --> 19:17.473
with their new country
rendition of Badlands...

19:17.682 --> 19:19.016
right here on
the night beacon of sound...

19:19.141 --> 19:21.018
K-GAB Radio.
- That's fine, Bobby.

19:21.143 --> 19:24.230
The last stand for country
music here in this country...

19:24.313 --> 19:26.607
where the old sidewinder
himself, Pecos Bob Steel...

19:26.691 --> 19:28.609

They're not going to stop now.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.412
Okay, just be quiet.

19:40.288 --> 19:42.373
So, Herm... What do you say?
When can he start?

19:42.456 --> 19:46.127
Now he's gotta do a few promos for the
Cowboy George concert down at The Floor 'Em.

19:46.168 --> 19:48.379
Fine, the next shift
is in four minutes.

19:48.462 --> 19:52.216
Stop, girls. Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:52.341 --> 19:54.677
He's just fooling around. You
know, don't worry, it's...

19:54.844 --> 19:58.889
You know these DJs. They're just
a bunch of crazy, funny guys.

20:00.725 --> 20:03.686
This is Bill Sutter
from Sutter Feed and Grain...

20:03.769 --> 20:07.064
saying, "Thanks, neighbors
and adios."

20:07.982 --> 20:09.442
I gotta get back to the store.

20:09.525 --> 20:11.694
Okay, well,
see you tomorrow, Bill.

20:16.198 --> 20:18.075
You got the drift
of the board, Bob, there?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.828
Uh, right, right.
Uh, Herm...

20:21.162 --> 20:24.248
Herm,
there's a little gig I do...

20:24.290 --> 20:26.751
with the Lennon Sisters.

20:27.209 --> 20:31.380
You wouldn't, by any chance, have one
of their albums round here, would you?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.050
Oh, well,
I got a copy of their...

20:34.175 --> 20:36.052
Too Marvelous For Words
album over there...

20:36.135 --> 20:39.138
but I think you better
stick with C&W Top 40--

20:39.221 --> 20:41.640
Oh, right, right. Herm, thanks, we're fine.
I think we got it.

20:41.724 --> 20:43.476
Everything's gonna turn out
real good.

20:43.559 --> 20:45.144
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

20:50.107 --> 20:53.486
Murdock, don't. I repeat, do
not play the Lennon Sisters.

20:54.695 --> 20:56.864
I'm in deep trouble here. You
know, I got to fill that hall.

20:56.947 --> 20:58.491
In fact, I got
to overfill that hall.

20:58.574 --> 21:01.202
See, I'm thinking if I can
set up three or four shows...

21:01.285 --> 21:02.620
maybe I can dig us
out of this ditch.

21:02.703 --> 21:04.830
Why don't you trust
the old sidewinder here?

21:04.955 --> 21:06.916
Turn on your radio
and just get out of here.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.377
Let the Prince of Platters do his tricks.
Come on. Come on.

21:11.379 --> 21:14.465
Don't forget the commercials, okay?
Boy George followed by Cowboy George.

21:14.590 --> 21:15.758
Get out of here.

21:27.228 --> 21:29.480
Out of the west
and into your living room...

21:29.563 --> 21:32.233
this is the old
sidewinder himself...

21:32.316 --> 21:34.026
Pecos Bob Steel...

21:34.151 --> 21:38.197
ambushing you with
the biggest hits on record.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.157
Now, buckle your seatbelts...

21:40.241 --> 21:43.702
'cause this stagecoach is a-rolling
with your favorite sounds.

21:43.828 --> 21:47.123
Out of the past,
the Lennon Sisters...

21:47.206 --> 21:50.584
singing the title song
from their hit album...

21:50.709 --> 21:53.796
<i>Too Marvelous For Words.</i>

21:53.963 --> 21:58.592
<i>Too Marvelous For Words.</i>

21:58.968 --> 22:03.931
<i>♪ You're just too marvelous ♪</i>

22:04.265 --> 22:06.517
<i>♪ Too marvelous ♪</i>

22:32.084 --> 22:35.337
This is the old diamondback,
Pecos Bob Steel...

22:35.462 --> 22:37.840
laying the wax and spinning
the sounds for you...

22:37.965 --> 22:41.135
on KGAB, K-GAB radio.

22:41.218 --> 22:43.345
Hey, how about a change of pace?

22:43.429 --> 22:46.056
Something out of the past,
an oldie but a goodie.

22:46.140 --> 22:48.934
Something from
the Lennon Sisters...

22:49.018 --> 22:52.146
and their hit album,
Too Marvelous For Words...

22:52.229 --> 22:53.522
this is...

22:54.899 --> 22:56.942
<i>Mr. Clarinet Man.</i>

22:57.026 --> 22:58.110
But...

22:58.235 --> 23:00.321
before we travel down
those tracks, partners...

23:00.613 --> 23:03.866
let me remind you about the great double
bill that we have tonight at The Floor 'Em.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.869
It's gonna be the two Georges in concert,
mixing and matching their sounds.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.288
First, it will be Boy George
and the Culture Club...

23:09.413 --> 23:13.000
and then it will be Cowboy
George and the Range Rats.

23:13.125 --> 23:17.338
So, y'all show up and tell them that Pecos
Bob engraved your invitation right here...

23:17.463 --> 23:20.841

24:29.076 --> 24:30.911
Cowboy George.
Telephone.

24:33.497 --> 24:34.456
Thanks.

24:35.457 --> 24:37.710
Howdy.
This is Cowboy George.

24:37.793 --> 24:39.128
Hey, man, it's going down.

24:39.253 --> 24:40.629
They're headed toward
Twin Rivers.

24:40.754 --> 24:41.797
Gotcha.

24:46.260 --> 24:49.138
<i>And now, straight from...</i>

24:49.221 --> 24:50.431
George...

24:51.473 --> 24:53.183
you're gonna have to
go on and stay on.

24:53.267 --> 24:54.601
I may not make it back.

24:54.810 --> 24:56.228
You're supposed to be
bailing me out of this.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.771
I mean, this is not
my kind of crowd.

24:57.855 --> 24:59.106
And I will if I can.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.109
I'll give you a great intro.

25:02.443 --> 25:05.404
Well, I'll go on. But these
people are in for a surprise.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.831
Really cool.

25:22.713 --> 25:24.256
I hear you been
out in the wilderness...

25:24.381 --> 25:26.133
for about three months
laying a pipeline...

25:26.258 --> 25:28.761
and we aim to entertain you.

25:31.805 --> 25:35.142
So, you just sit back and relax.

25:35.309 --> 25:37.102
'Cause opening for me tonight...

25:37.269 --> 25:39.938

is your most attractive trait.

36:35.385 --> 36:36.553
I know.

36:51.234 --> 36:53.778
Hey, open the door!
Open the door!

36:54.195 --> 36:56.031
Doesn't sound like our fan club.

36:58.408 --> 36:59.659
Come on, guys.

37:00.243 --> 37:03.163
Face, see if there's a back
door out of this joint.

37:17.010 --> 37:18.845
Okay, boys, get that bench.

37:22.015 --> 37:23.016
Find anything?

37:23.099 --> 37:25.602
Oh, yeah,
I found the real sheriff.

37:26.728 --> 37:27.812
Dead.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.773
Oh, man, they gonna
think we killed him.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.943
This situation
has some ragged edges.

37:34.110 --> 37:36.321
Yeah. Well, you'll come
up with something.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.948
I can't think
with all this noise.

37:57.592 --> 37:59.469
I think that we need
a little diversion here.

37:59.552 --> 38:00.887
Why don't we do something
to help with it?

38:01.012 --> 38:02.013
Come on.

38:07.894 --> 38:10.605
Face usually does this.
It looks easy but...

38:10.855 --> 38:12.190
Hold on, hold on.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.025
I got a bobby.

38:14.109 --> 38:15.360
A... Oh.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.786
See, a really honest man doesn't have
an appetite for this sort of thing.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.454
Yeah, but who needs honesty?

38:35.672 --> 38:37.257
Get a idea.

38:41.261 --> 38:43.138
Idea. Idea.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.303
What do you think?

38:48.560 --> 38:51.187
Not if you wanna get
past those cowboys. No way.

38:52.355 --> 38:53.690
How about this?

38:54.482 --> 38:56.317
Mmm, it loses your eyes.

38:57.485 --> 38:59.696
This is it.
Perfect fit, too.

38:59.863 --> 39:00.989
Really?

39:02.073 --> 39:03.324
A bonnet!

39:17.130 --> 39:19.340
Please, please.

39:20.842 --> 39:25.305
One of the men inside is the
father of my unborn child.

39:30.226 --> 39:33.396
Look, lady, they stole our money
and knocked over the bank.

39:33.521 --> 39:34.480
And we're gonna hang them.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.567
Oh, no, please, please, please.

39:38.943 --> 39:43.531
He only stole the money
because of the baby.

39:43.907 --> 39:47.285
We had such wonderful plans...

39:47.410 --> 39:48.786
for the child.

39:49.037 --> 39:52.457
Because we all must learn to
appreciate the Lennon Sisters.

39:52.582 --> 39:55.960
I know, I know it's not right...

39:56.044 --> 39:57.712
that he stole your money.

39:58.421 --> 40:02.842
But I also know that if you
allow me to go into the jail...

40:03.009 --> 40:04.844
untouched, unharmed...

40:05.428 --> 40:07.430
that I can convince him...

40:08.014 --> 40:09.849
to give you back your money.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.726
What if they won't?

40:12.310 --> 40:14.270
Well, if you hang them...

40:14.354 --> 40:16.439
you'll never get
your money back.

40:16.522 --> 40:19.567
Oh, please, if you
won't do it for me...

40:20.235 --> 40:22.862
do it for my baby.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.324
Okay, lady,
you got five minutes.

40:26.574 --> 40:27.784
Thank you.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.128
Herbert.
Herbert, it's Cynthia.

40:39.420 --> 40:42.006
Open up, darling.
We've got to talk.

40:42.298 --> 40:44.801
Cynthia? Go away.

40:44.926 --> 40:46.386
I can't.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.472
Herbert, oh, Herbert,
we've got to talk...

40:49.555 --> 40:50.807
for the baby.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.934
Baby? What that fool
talking about?

40:52.976 --> 40:54.644
I don't know. Let's
open up and find out.

41:03.278 --> 41:05.071
Oh, you handsome
pile of trouble.

41:05.154 --> 41:07.365
I didn't realize all that
you did for little Herbert.

41:07.448 --> 41:09.075
Man, are you the ugliest
woman I ever seen!

41:09.158 --> 41:10.576
I think I'm gonna
like the baby though.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.954
I chose the Lamaze
method of delivery.

41:13.037 --> 41:15.581
Hold your breath and
remember your exercises.

41:16.082 --> 41:18.167
Explosives. Oh.

41:18.334 --> 41:19.377
Uh-huh.

41:20.837 --> 41:22.422
Great, Murdock.

41:22.839 --> 41:23.965
Great.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.260
You know, Murdock, you look
better to me as a woman...

41:27.343 --> 41:28.386
than you do as a man.

41:28.469 --> 41:30.263
Face, I don't have time
for that sort of thing now.

41:30.346 --> 41:32.140
Boy George is waiting behind the
Sheriff's office. We've gotta go.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.975
Come on, man,
let's mine these walls.

41:53.745 --> 41:54.829
Watch.

41:56.289 --> 41:57.457
Time's up!

42:09.469 --> 42:11.262
Come on, guys,
let's go after them.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.353
Tell me about
that building you saw.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.228
No, forget about that.

42:19.312 --> 42:20.521
They said something
about the airport.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.357
B.A., hit it right
on the next dirt road.

42:22.482 --> 42:23.775
This is great.

44:31.068 --> 44:32.737
Totally awesome, Hannibal.

44:37.825 --> 44:39.243
Hey, what's going on here?

44:39.368 --> 44:40.578
Here's your money.

44:41.329 --> 44:42.705
These are the guys who took it.

44:42.788 --> 44:43.581
Yeah, but I thought that--

44:43.706 --> 44:45.666
Now, they killed the sheriff
over at Twin Rivers.

44:45.791 --> 44:47.043
This guy's no sheriff.

44:47.126 --> 44:50.004
Run a make on him, you'll get a
book and sheet 10 feet long.

44:50.171 --> 44:52.006
I guess we owe you guys
an apology, huh?

44:52.131 --> 44:53.883
What about me? I'm the
one who lost the baby.

44:54.050 --> 44:55.218
Oh-oh, they're at it again,
Colonel.

44:55.301 --> 44:57.053
Only this time they're singing
No Place Like Home.

44:57.136 --> 44:59.055
Great idea, Murdock.
Let's go.

45:04.352 --> 45:07.313
Hey. Hey,
who are you guys?

45:07.480 --> 45:08.689
We're the A-Team.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.608
- Son of a gun.
- So there.

45:16.405 --> 45:22.620
We want George!
We want George!

45:22.745 --> 45:24.789
Neat crowd, huh.
Music lovers, all.

45:24.914 --> 45:26.624
Reminds me of a lynch
crowd I once saw.

45:26.707 --> 45:28.084
Now, Face, this is one...

45:28.167 --> 45:29.502
you gonna have to explain to me.

45:29.585 --> 45:32.421
I mean, you been trying to teach me
how to be a rocko-socko agent...

45:32.505 --> 45:34.507
but you haven't given me any
inkling, not an inkling...

45:34.590 --> 45:36.008
as to how you pulled this off.

45:36.175 --> 45:39.553
Yeah, man, how come you don't owe Boy
George his couple of million dollars?

45:39.679 --> 45:40.846
Yeah.
Yeah.

45:40.930 --> 45:41.597
Yeah.

45:41.722 --> 45:44.517
Anyone can get Boy George
to play a large auditorium.

45:44.642 --> 45:48.521
How many guys do you know can get
him to play to a crowd like this?

45:48.938 --> 45:56.946
We want George!
We want George!

45:57.113 --> 46:00.199
If I can have your attention
here. Please.

46:00.533 --> 46:02.660
Let's have
a big, warm welcome...

46:02.743 --> 46:05.204
for the Culture Club.

46:15.423 --> 46:19.760
And now, without further ado,
the roughest, toughest...

46:19.844 --> 46:22.471
cowpoke to ever
ride the range...

46:22.638 --> 46:25.850
