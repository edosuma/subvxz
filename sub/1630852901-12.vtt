00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.041 --> 01:00.458


01:13.833 --> 01:16.291
-It's not in here.
-He moved it again.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.666
Nope. Not here.

01:20.791 --> 01:22.625
Not under here either.

01:33.291 --> 01:34.250
Bingo!

01:45.083 --> 01:46.166
Aw, jeez.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.541
We gotta get these fixed
before Elder Kettle wakes up.

01:53.708 --> 01:56.791
Boys, have you seen my glasses?

01:56.875 --> 01:57.875
-Oof!

01:57.958 --> 02:01.833
No, no, Kettle. You lost 'em somewhere.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.416
Just like you… Oof!

02:05.916 --> 02:07.750
…always do.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.333
Oh! There you are.

02:10.416 --> 02:12.291
Okay, boys. Listen.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.666
Stay put. I'll find 'em.

02:14.750 --> 02:18.416
Last thing I need
is you two stepping on 'em. Got it?

02:21.458 --> 02:22.791
Wow.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.791
You're actually listening for once.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.833
Thank you, boys.

02:29.125 --> 02:30.500
-Ow!

02:35.583 --> 02:37.125
Let me get this straight.

02:37.208 --> 02:42.208
You mean to tell me you two couldn't get
a cookie jar from a sleeping old man?

02:43.333 --> 02:45.875
Look, lady, can you fix 'em or not?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.916
Of course. But I don't like your tone.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.083
Hmph!

02:54.416 --> 02:57.916
Kindly turn that down. I hate music!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.833
We're not playing music.

03:15.666 --> 03:19.291


03:25.041 --> 03:26.500


03:26.583 --> 03:28.208
What the heck was that?!

03:30.583 --> 03:32.583
Hey! Get back here!

03:35.458 --> 03:37.625
You seen a chalice run past here?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.666
Oops. Uh, sorry.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.166
Uh…

03:46.958 --> 03:49.333


03:58.875 --> 04:00.250


04:02.416 --> 04:04.041


04:12.708 --> 04:13.583
Ho, ho, ho!

04:15.208 --> 04:16.750
Aw…

04:17.291 --> 04:18.166
Oh!

04:37.625 --> 04:38.875
Yay!

04:38.958 --> 04:39.791
Tickets.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.416
That's not a ticket.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.291
How about now?

04:52.708 --> 04:54.166
Ooh!

05:08.208 --> 05:10.916
How does she get people
to just give her stuff?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.958
She could definitely help us
get Elder Kettle's cookies.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.250
Shh!

05:15.791 --> 05:16.625
Sorry.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.291


05:23.041 --> 05:25.125
-Hey, where'd she go?
-I don't know.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.750
It's like she just disappeared.

05:28.708 --> 05:29.750
Whoa! Oof!

05:29.833 --> 05:31.666
All right, who are you two working for?

05:31.750 --> 05:33.666
Working? We don't have jobs.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.375
Yeah. We're just a couple of dum-dums.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.250
Zip it, ding-dong.
She don't gotta know we're dum-dums.

05:39.333 --> 05:42.458
Why are you following me? Spill the beans
or you'll be spilling milk!

05:42.541 --> 05:45.375
We just wanna learn
how you get so much free stuff.

05:45.458 --> 05:47.166
And maybe hang out?

05:47.250 --> 05:49.291
That's all, Ms…

05:49.375 --> 05:52.125
The name's Chalice. Ms. Chalice.

05:52.208 --> 05:55.000
You don't wanna get mixed up
with a gal like me.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.208
This chalice is nothing but trouble.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.375
We love trouble!

05:58.458 --> 05:59.291
We do?

05:59.375 --> 06:03.708
Yeah. Why, just this morning,
we decided to steal cookies

06:03.791 --> 06:05.625
from our elderly caretaker.

06:05.708 --> 06:09.916
When you put it like that,
I suppose we <i>do</i> love trouble.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.750
Oh, brother.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.750
Looks like I got a couple
of real degenerates on my hands.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.916
Yep. Degenerates.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.500
We didn't actually get the cookies though.

06:21.000 --> 06:21.958
-Hey!
-What?

06:22.041 --> 06:24.500
We need her help.
We might as well be honest.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.250
One thing you gotta know about me,

06:26.333 --> 06:29.375
I get by without partners,
friends, anyone or anything.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.958
This is a solo act. A one-person show.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.166
Aw!

06:33.666 --> 06:35.791
But your pathetic story charms me.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.791
Wanna know how I do what I do?

06:37.875 --> 06:38.875
Yeah!

06:38.958 --> 06:40.375
You <i>really</i> wanna know?

06:40.458 --> 06:41.791
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

06:41.875 --> 06:43.416
Okay, then. Pay attention.

06:48.875 --> 06:53.166


06:58.833 --> 07:03.416


07:43.000 --> 07:45.666


07:45.750 --> 07:48.041


07:48.125 --> 07:52.166


08:02.125 --> 08:03.916
What a day.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.166
You said it.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.458
I gotta admit, I don't usually
stick around in one place this long.

08:08.541 --> 08:11.333
But you two are kinda fun.
Ready for your test?

08:11.416 --> 08:12.416
Test?!

08:12.500 --> 08:15.708
Come on. You two are naturals!
It's gonna be a breeze.

08:16.916 --> 08:20.333
All you gotta do
is charm your way past that guy.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.291
Get inside and there's a surprise.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.833
Surprise? We love surprises!

08:35.708 --> 08:37.666


08:48.416 --> 08:50.166


08:54.166 --> 08:56.500


09:08.000 --> 09:10.416
-Hey, it worked!
-We <i>are</i> charming.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.625
Great job, boys. Now here's your surprise!

09:19.541 --> 09:21.083
Is this a…

09:24.083 --> 09:26.250
Cookie factory!

09:26.333 --> 09:28.791
That's right. And it's all-you-can-eat.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.791
Shh!

09:43.916 --> 09:46.208
Gee, what a couple of ding-dongs.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.541
Cheese it, boys! The cops!

09:51.416 --> 09:52.250
Cops?!

09:55.458 --> 09:56.958
This is the police!

09:57.041 --> 09:58.708
We have you surrounded!

10:00.291 --> 10:01.708
Come on!

10:02.625 --> 10:03.458
Get up!

10:04.250 --> 10:06.125
-We gotta scram!

10:09.416 --> 10:10.250
Sorry, boys.

10:10.333 --> 10:13.250
I like ya, but not enough
to tangle with the cops.

10:14.916 --> 10:16.000
So long, fellas.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.916
My mug.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.166
Oh, what happened? Where's Chalice?

10:26.458 --> 10:27.916
You're under arrest!

10:39.041 --> 10:39.875
Whoa!
