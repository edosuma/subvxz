[music playing]

00:08.523 --> 00:11.271
Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express.

00:11.375 --> 00:15.864
Come and watch Pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:15.969 --> 00:18.926
they were given by him upstairs.

00:19.030 --> 00:23.553
And kids they're convinced aren't actually theirs.

00:23.658 --> 00:27.276
What sounds on earth could ever replace kids needing

00:27.380 --> 00:29.780
money and wives in your face.

00:29.885 --> 00:32.738
Because this, people reckon, and me included,

00:32.843 --> 00:37.469
is why pubs and drugs were kindly invented,

00:37.574 --> 00:39.871
to calm us all down.

00:39.975 --> 00:41.888
Stop us going mental.

00:41.993 --> 00:46.516
These are Chatsworth Estate's basic essentials.

00:46.620 --> 00:50.760
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:50.865 --> 00:54.587
You shit on our heads, but you pay the taxes.

00:59.145 --> 01:02.763
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers,

01:02.868 --> 01:05.512
who'll come on your face for the price of a beer.

01:05.616 --> 01:07.912
Make poverty history.

01:08.016 --> 01:09.931
Cheaper drugs now.

01:10.035 --> 01:12.957
Make poverty history.

01:13.062 --> 01:16.054
Cheaper drugs now.

01:16.158 --> 01:17.028
Scatter!

01:24.160 --> 01:25.726
MICKY MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): I used to fall over

01:25.830 --> 01:27.813
on purpose, when I was little.

01:27.918 --> 01:31.571
I loved having stingy stuff on my cuts.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.415
Hugs.

01:33.519 --> 01:35.364
[inaudible] missed a [inaudible] plaster.

01:35.468 --> 01:38.390
When I picked off my scabs to get more TLC,

01:38.495 --> 01:39.677
mom sussed us out--

01:39.782 --> 01:42.947
told me to do my own fucking first aid--

01:43.053 --> 01:44.896
stopped mothering me.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.749
But I realized she was teaching us a lesson--

01:47.853 --> 01:50.810
you got to be a big boy, look out for number one, right?

01:50.915 --> 01:54.220
But what happens if you can't take care of yourself?

01:54.324 --> 01:57.455
One day, chicken Licking was playing under an oak tree

01:57.560 --> 01:59.509
when suddenly, an acorn fell on his head.

01:59.613 --> 02:02.361
Poor chicken Licking didn't know that it was an acorn.

02:02.466 --> 02:04.275
He thought the sky was falling down,

02:04.379 --> 02:05.945
so he hurried off to tell the King.

02:06.050 --> 02:06.885
This is serious.

02:21.706 --> 02:22.645
Fucking, Mimi.

02:35.727 --> 02:36.771
Fucking, Kelly.

02:48.461 --> 02:50.861
MIMI MAGUIRE: Patrick, there's a queue out here.

02:50.965 --> 02:53.575
Yeah, I won't be long.

02:53.679 --> 02:56.671
MICKY MAGUIRE : I've got a bladder full of beer.

02:56.776 --> 02:57.437
Sink.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.107
Empty it first, though.

03:02.691 --> 03:03.943
[knocking]

03:04.047 --> 03:05.231
MIMI MAGUIRE: Fuck's sake, Paddy.

03:12.954 --> 03:14.833
Sleepwalking.

03:14.937 --> 03:16.085
Improvising.

03:16.189 --> 03:18.311
Your father's moved into the bathroom.

03:18.417 --> 03:20.677
Oh, you can tell number son's moved back home.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.730
I have to piss in Ivan's yard.

03:22.835 --> 03:25.026
Oy.

03:25.131 --> 03:26.106
Get a move on.

03:26.210 --> 03:27.497
I want us all there when they bring

03:27.601 --> 03:30.768
our Shane out of his coma.

03:30.872 --> 03:32.924
- I'm not sure I can be there. - You are.

03:33.029 --> 03:34.699
But what if he doesn't wake up?

03:34.803 --> 03:37.691
What if he's special?

03:37.795 --> 03:39.082
He'll be fine.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.414
The doctor said there was low levels of brain activity.

03:41.518 --> 03:43.780
PADDY MAGUIRE: We didn't need a scan to tell us that.

03:43.884 --> 03:46.284
Be a man and do as your mother says.

03:46.388 --> 03:47.642
Right.

03:47.746 --> 03:49.938
Please god, our Shane won't wake up a cabbage,

03:50.042 --> 03:55.852
but if it's his will, we stay strong.

03:55.956 --> 03:58.879
OK.

03:58.983 --> 04:00.375
All right.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.924
Chop, chop, upstairs, get ready-- quick as you can.

04:04.028 --> 04:06.602
[baby crying]

04:10.673 --> 04:14.222
Oh, [inaudible] she's crying.

04:14.327 --> 04:16.310
Small man, your sister.

04:16.414 --> 04:18.466
Sorry, don't know that sort of crying.

04:18.572 --> 04:21.493
It's not a hungry cry, so I can't feed her.

04:21.598 --> 04:23.408
It's not a change me sound, and she

04:23.512 --> 04:26.017
slept all through the night, so she can't be tired.

04:26.121 --> 04:27.409
Poor little thing.

04:27.513 --> 04:29.182
Where is every one?

04:29.286 --> 04:30.504
No molester--

04:30.609 --> 04:32.140
LIAM GALLAGHER: Debbie's doing her homework.

04:32.245 --> 04:34.228
Piss off waste men.

04:34.332 --> 04:35.376
LIAM GALLAGHER: Carl's is getting

04:35.480 --> 04:37.776
ready for his footie match.

04:37.881 --> 04:40.525
And, um-- dad's doing some housework.

04:40.629 --> 04:41.777
Right.

04:41.881 --> 04:45.013
Fetch everyone now-- family conference.

04:45.117 --> 04:46.475
All right, all right, listen up.

04:46.579 --> 04:48.771
I've called us all together, because your daughter's

04:48.875 --> 04:50.614
got thrush.

04:50.718 --> 04:52.771
You OK with this being discussed?

04:52.876 --> 04:53.711
Not me.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.320
Stella-- she got a mouth infection.

04:56.425 --> 04:58.825
Someone's not been sterilizing her bottles.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.112
She'll end up in social services.

05:07.837 --> 05:08.880
I rinse them.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.377
I rinse them.

05:10.481 --> 05:12.116
NORMA STARKEY: OK look, we'll get us some antibiotics

05:12.220 --> 05:13.090
to clear it up.

05:13.194 --> 05:14.516
But this can't happen.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.429
It's up to us to look after her now.

05:16.534 --> 05:18.657
Look, I've drawn up this rota, right?

05:18.761 --> 05:20.222
Whoa, whoa, noise, noise.

05:20.326 --> 05:21.788
What's all this us and we?

05:21.892 --> 05:25.510

Fuck's it to you?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.643
Ah, dad?

05:32.747 --> 05:38.279
No, she loiters, scraps off our table, her mate's done one.

05:38.384 --> 05:39.845
Why is she still here?

05:50.352 --> 05:52.021
You need to look after Stella properly.

05:56.302 --> 05:59.015
Talking to a professional--

05:59.119 --> 06:00.859
raised more kids than Barnardo's.

06:09.557 --> 06:11.574
Oh wake up, bruv.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.219
Please, don't be soft.

06:14.323 --> 06:17.942
I'm just going to get some fresh air.

06:18.046 --> 06:19.055
MIMI MAGUIRE: I'll keep watch.

06:19.159 --> 06:20.272
He moved, I think.

06:24.900 --> 06:25.770
There.

06:25.874 --> 06:26.813
I'll fetch the doctor.

06:26.918 --> 06:29.840
Shane, can you hear me?

06:34.432 --> 06:36.207
Oh, my baby.

06:36.311 --> 06:38.225
Shane, it's your mom.

06:38.329 --> 06:39.582
Say something.

06:39.687 --> 06:40.556
SHANE MAGUIRE: Hello.

06:43.966 --> 06:45.567
Hiya, kid.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.376
How's the loaf?

06:47.480 --> 06:50.194
It hurt.

06:50.298 --> 07:02.788
[inaudible] oh, uh-- what is wrong with my hands?

07:02.892 --> 07:04.180
What is wrong with me?

CARL GALLAGHER: All right, Norma, you've

07:16.496 --> 07:18.444

07:18.548 --> 07:19.628
I'm away then.

07:19.732 --> 07:20.427
OK.

07:20.532 --> 07:21.541
For good like.

07:21.645 --> 07:22.723
LIP GALLAGHER: Take it easy.

07:35.248 --> 07:36.502
Can you open this for us?

07:39.076 --> 07:39.946
All right.

07:43.077 --> 07:45.408
Thanks.

07:45.512 --> 07:47.843
Are you off then?

07:47.948 --> 07:49.687
Do you think I should stay?

07:49.792 --> 07:52.158
If I had to stay out here for as long as you have,

07:52.262 --> 07:53.585
I'd probably want to go home.

07:56.298 --> 07:58.421
Well this-- this is my--

07:58.525 --> 08:01.342
See ya.

08:01.447 --> 08:04.022
[music playing]

08:26.949 --> 08:28.620
Don't like it.

08:28.724 --> 08:30.116
Stop mucking around.

08:30.220 --> 08:31.333
Eat it.

08:31.437 --> 08:33.803
Be a good girl for your mum, Katie.

08:33.908 --> 08:35.926
She's looking pretty for you, too.

08:36.030 --> 08:37.909
She got a bit of color in cheeks.

08:38.013 --> 08:41.597
Has she been on her jollies without telling?

08:41.701 --> 08:42.745
You're all right Karen.

08:42.849 --> 08:43.893
I'll replace it.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.494
I don't mind.

08:45.598 --> 08:49.633
It's just it's decent stuff, and a little goes a long way.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.408
I wanted to try something darker.

08:51.512 --> 08:54.052
Joe goes on at me looking anemic.

08:54.157 --> 08:55.374
I wouldn't put up with that.

08:55.479 --> 08:56.661
I don't want to.

08:56.765 --> 08:58.332
I wanted a change, that's all.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.290
Who let you in?

09:05.394 --> 09:06.647
Your cleaner.

09:06.751 --> 09:09.604
I told her I had a mighty urge to snog my girlfriend.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.900
Morning, beautiful.

09:12.005 --> 09:13.153
Big game today, isn't it?

09:13.257 --> 09:15.310
Aye, going to get stuck into this lot.

09:18.337 --> 09:21.329
Have you been on a sun bed?

09:21.433 --> 09:22.965
Out of the tub.

09:23.069 --> 09:25.748
You know, trying a new look.

09:25.852 --> 09:29.331
Well, I think she looks great.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.288
Oh, sorry, totally missed my cue, there, didn't I?

09:38.307 --> 09:39.351
MANDY MAGUIRE: Joe--

09:43.317 --> 09:44.257
PADDY MAGUIRE: Thanks, doctor.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.657
I appreciate it.

09:46.761 --> 09:48.327
You won't win brain of Britain,

09:48.432 --> 09:49.441
but you're coming home.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.762
They need the bed.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.258
You remember what happened, don't you?

09:52.363 --> 09:54.764
You're not going to go Borne identity?

09:54.868 --> 09:56.155
No.

09:56.259 --> 10:01.444
Me and Kell, we were conning Larry and Leonard.

10:01.548 --> 10:03.566
- He's getting mixed up. - And I was--

10:03.671 --> 10:06.071
you fooled him and I--

10:06.175 --> 10:09.445
I robbed him.

10:09.551 --> 10:13.273
One come-- came and punched me.

10:13.377 --> 10:15.848
You fucking devious tart.

10:15.952 --> 10:16.961
I should have known.

10:17.066 --> 10:18.109
Drop it, Mimo.

10:18.214 --> 10:21.275
This is between me and her.

10:21.379 --> 10:22.040
You OK.

10:22.145 --> 10:23.014
Fine.

10:23.119 --> 10:25.137
Just bastard heartburn.

10:25.241 --> 10:26.285
This is mad.

10:26.389 --> 10:28.199
We should be celebrating.

10:28.303 --> 10:29.242
Oh I will.

10:29.347 --> 10:32.199
And so will my son without you.

10:32.304 --> 10:34.427
He's coming home to get some proper care.

10:34.531 --> 10:36.687
I can look after him.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.740
You going to feed him, wash him,

10:38.845 --> 10:41.697
speech therapy, physiotherapy--

10:41.802 --> 10:44.203
big difference dressing as a dirty nurse

10:44.307 --> 10:45.942
and wiping a dirty arse.

10:46.047 --> 10:47.334
That's enough.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.665
Just giving her a chance to walk.

10:49.769 --> 10:51.057
I know she's thinking about it.

CARL GALLAGHER: I'm telling you, boss.

11:24.527 --> 11:25.709
Stick us up front.

11:25.813 --> 11:27.380
Keep playing the ball like over the top.

11:27.484 --> 11:28.145
And [inaudible].

11:28.249 --> 11:29.780
I'll run all day, me.

11:29.884 --> 11:32.111
Speed, creatine, and Viagra-- reckons it will make him more

11:32.216 --> 11:33.642
potent in front of the goal. - Right.

11:33.746 --> 11:35.381
Well, I'm loving the commitment, Carlos,

11:35.486 --> 11:37.782
but you might want to stick to more traditional methods

11:37.886 --> 11:39.139
of conditioning.

11:39.244 --> 11:41.227
Karen, when you get a sec--

11:41.331 --> 11:43.419
microwave, full power, for a minute.

11:43.523 --> 11:44.427
Ta.

11:44.532 --> 11:45.784
Pre-match meal for the lads.

11:45.889 --> 11:47.280
I'm not fucking eat that.

11:47.385 --> 11:49.855
You are eating it.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.629
I'll do it.

11:51.733 --> 11:55.213
What's he like.

11:55.317 --> 11:56.048
Wanker.

11:56.152 --> 11:57.056
You reckon?

11:57.161 --> 11:58.065
Pff.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.283
Captain of the footie team.

11:59.388 --> 12:00.848
Big fucking mick.

12:00.954 --> 12:05.894
Calling all the shots-- says jump, and you jump, or else.

12:05.998 --> 12:06.868
Or else what?

12:10.348 --> 12:11.217
I don't know.

12:11.321 --> 12:12.539
He'll play you left back.

12:12.644 --> 12:13.896
[cheers]

12:14.000 --> 12:16.400
Nice one, dude.

12:16.505 --> 12:18.836
Hey, Jonesy, good man.

12:18.941 --> 12:23.220
You know that local custom-- he who jacks the bandit--

12:23.324 --> 12:24.403
Fuck off.

12:29.378 --> 12:31.223
Well what if he stays like this?

12:31.327 --> 12:35.536
Can't walk, can't talk, people trying not to look as he

12:35.641 --> 12:37.276
drags himself along the street?

12:37.380 --> 12:38.668
He will get better.

12:38.772 --> 12:41.729
It's just going to take time and help.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.373
Listen, I didn't exactly grow up dreaming of emptying

12:44.478 --> 12:48.827
colostomy bags all day, but some patients really need your help.

12:48.931 --> 12:50.844
They can't do it themselves.

12:50.949 --> 12:53.280
Well, apart from the perverts who shit themselves

12:53.384 --> 12:54.358
just to get a bed bath.

12:54.464 --> 12:57.525
Murder, aren't they?

12:57.629 --> 12:59.194
You can do this.

12:59.299 --> 13:01.908
Your job is all about taking care of people.

13:02.013 --> 13:06.605
Just see it as another personal service.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.205
Anyway, better get back.

13:08.310 --> 13:10.537
Floor management subcontract me job out at twice the cost.

13:19.408 --> 13:20.766
PADDY MAGUIRE: Oy!

13:20.870 --> 13:22.505
Watch where the fuck you're going, all right?

13:22.609 --> 13:23.479
Fuck you.

13:52.147 --> 13:54.409
KELLY BALL: Easy bruiser.

13:54.513 --> 13:56.322
You'll give me a heart attack.

13:56.428 --> 13:58.550
Miss the target, you'll give yourself one.

13:58.654 --> 14:01.298
You can't find a decent vein, because of UV lights in here

14:01.402 --> 14:03.281
to stop them showing up.

14:03.386 --> 14:06.691
You could always try your eye, or your nuts--

14:06.795 --> 14:09.648
depends on what you need it, or them, I suppose.

14:09.752 --> 14:10.656
Leave me alone.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.118
And let you collapse a vein--

14:12.223 --> 14:13.719
can you imagine your missus?

14:13.823 --> 14:16.850
My Paddy, dead on the bog.

14:16.954 --> 14:18.519
Needle hanging off him.

14:18.624 --> 14:21.408
And you fucking knew he was using?

14:21.512 --> 14:23.008
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

14:23.113 --> 14:25.200
Not really.

14:25.304 --> 14:26.208
Come here.

14:26.313 --> 14:28.400
Looks like you got a bubble.

14:28.506 --> 14:30.593
It makes no odds to me, just want

14:30.697 --> 14:31.845
to check you're doing it right.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.421
You should tell her--

14:38.525 --> 14:39.847
Mimo.

14:39.951 --> 14:42.179
Give her a chance to fight for you,

14:42.283 --> 14:47.258
because when you need smack, no way could she compete.

14:47.362 --> 14:49.554
Shane's coming back with me.

14:49.659 --> 14:52.999
Find a way of squaring that with his mom.

14:53.103 --> 14:54.043
Fine.

14:54.147 --> 14:55.433
Give it here.

14:55.539 --> 14:59.017
And you-- let him do his own thing outside the family--

14:59.122 --> 15:01.175
no taxing.

15:01.279 --> 15:03.958
OK.

15:04.062 --> 15:04.967
Weren't a bubble.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.149
Syringe is cracked.

15:06.254 --> 15:08.168
It's useless.

15:08.272 --> 15:10.707
Fuck off.

15:10.811 --> 15:13.213
Where you going?

15:13.317 --> 15:14.535
What am I supposed to do?

15:14.639 --> 15:16.413
It depends how desperate you are.

15:16.518 --> 15:18.988
You could always neck it, wait for it to work.

15:19.093 --> 15:20.066
Very funny.

15:20.171 --> 15:22.537
I need it now.

15:22.641 --> 15:23.546
Give us ten bob.

15:52.561 --> 15:55.101
[fire alarm]

16:00.807 --> 16:04.531
[laughing]

16:04.635 --> 16:05.539
Fire alarm.

16:05.643 --> 16:08.183
All visitors have to do one.

16:08.288 --> 16:09.193
Be back soon, love.

16:09.297 --> 16:10.132
Be brave, son.

16:27.562 --> 16:30.798
Where the fucking hell have you been?

16:30.903 --> 16:31.981
You're soaking wet.

16:37.652 --> 16:38.556
Devious slag.

16:44.158 --> 16:46.141
There you go.

16:46.245 --> 16:47.776
Are you all right?

16:51.081 --> 16:51.951
Oh, cheers.

16:52.055 --> 16:54.457
It's all right.

16:54.561 --> 16:57.935
Well let's get you comfy.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.441
Pillows-- up or down?

17:00.545 --> 17:02.146
Up, I rec.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.372
You've been on your back more than me, past week.

17:09.382 --> 17:10.599
What's the matter?

17:13.522 --> 17:15.053
Bollocks.

17:15.157 --> 17:17.105
I'm a fucking retard.

17:17.211 --> 17:18.185
Shh.

17:18.289 --> 17:19.157
Don't say that.

17:19.262 --> 17:20.098
Look at me.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.430
I can't even talk.

17:29.109 --> 17:32.762
What if-- what if I can't get better?

17:32.867 --> 17:33.911
You're going to get right.

17:34.015 --> 17:35.650
How can you-- you don't know that.

17:35.754 --> 17:40.103
I chuffin' well do, cause I'm going to fix you.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.782
I can do this.

17:42.886 --> 17:43.930
You just need to trust me.

17:44.034 --> 17:44.870
OK?

17:49.844 --> 17:51.098
Beer's off.

17:51.202 --> 17:52.524
So? Change it.

17:52.628 --> 17:53.498
Well, can't you do it?

18:13.886 --> 18:15.869
KAREN GALLAGHER: Everything all right?

18:15.974 --> 18:17.017
Fine.

18:17.122 --> 18:18.235
Fancy going out tomorrow night?

18:18.340 --> 18:19.626
Good for me to get out of here.

18:19.730 --> 18:20.984
Go for a dance and a proper chat.

18:21.088 --> 18:21.923
Yeah.

18:22.028 --> 18:23.210
I'll ran it past Joe.

18:23.314 --> 18:24.324
Why, what's it to him?

18:24.428 --> 18:25.506
He might have something planned.

18:25.610 --> 18:28.324
I won't hold me breath then.

18:28.429 --> 18:29.647
What's that supposed to mean.

18:29.751 --> 18:32.187
You don't always have to do what Joe says.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.161
I know, Karen.

18:33.265 --> 18:34.309
I'm just saying.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.352
Well don't bother.

18:38.623 --> 18:41.406
Ian, can you man the bar for a minute?

18:41.511 --> 18:42.380
Yeah.

18:45.790 --> 18:46.903
Look at me.

18:47.008 --> 18:50.487
Me heart's going like fucking clappers.

18:50.592 --> 18:51.461
Am I going to die?

18:51.565 --> 18:52.922
Could you try?

18:53.026 --> 18:54.210
Because then we'd get this much abandoned instead

18:54.314 --> 18:56.888
of having to start a man down.

18:56.993 --> 18:58.141
What the fuck is that?

19:01.168 --> 19:04.508
PLAYER: Right, ten minutes to kick-off.

19:04.612 --> 19:05.969
Yeah, all right, ref.

19:06.074 --> 19:07.535
I won't be a sec.

19:10.736 --> 19:12.023
If you're looking for Jamie--

19:12.128 --> 19:13.693
I'm not here to see him.

19:13.797 --> 19:16.233
All right, well, we're just about to kick-off.

19:16.337 --> 19:17.972
Well, you can go when I'm done.

19:18.076 --> 19:20.268
You don't get everything your own way, tough guy.

19:20.373 --> 19:21.034
All right.

19:21.139 --> 19:21.486
Whatever, Karen.

19:25.731 --> 19:30.811
I know what you've been up to, and it stops right now.

19:30.915 --> 19:32.446
You've lost me.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.011
You don't think I know why Mandy slapped

19:34.115 --> 19:35.612
all that fake tanner on her.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.934
Listen to me, whatever you two have been yapping about--

19:37.038 --> 19:40.448
She said nothing. She doesn't have to.

19:40.552 --> 19:46.223
Oh, so it's all [inaudible] This

19:46.327 --> 19:47.580
is what happens when you've got too

19:47.684 --> 19:49.563
much spare time on your hands.

19:49.667 --> 19:50.989
You need to get laid.

19:54.817 --> 19:56.382
Take your hands off me.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.087
I'll scream and Jamie will be here--

19:58.191 --> 19:59.479
Oh, what, him?

20:04.594 --> 20:07.168
[music playing]

20:22.824 --> 20:25.399
[voices]

20:45.613 --> 20:48.049
Ah!

20:48.153 --> 20:49.231
He's always the last out.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.258
He's superstitious.

20:52.362 --> 20:53.615
I'll chase him up, yeah?

20:53.719 --> 20:54.588
All right then.

20:54.694 --> 20:57.685
Yeah.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.807
Ah.

20:59.913 --> 21:01.199
JAMIE MAGUIRE: Fuck sake, Joe.

21:01.304 --> 21:02.521
It's getting cold out here, mate.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.088
What the fuck you doing?

21:08.193 --> 21:09.411
I'm just warming up, mate.

21:09.515 --> 21:12.506
My hamstring's tighter than a banjo string.

21:12.611 --> 21:13.898
Just give a sec, yeah?

21:14.003 --> 21:14.977
I'm going to go for a piss. JAMIE MAGUIRE: Yeah.

21:15.081 --> 21:16.020
Well, hurry up, mate.

21:16.125 --> 21:16.717
The ref's going to start without ya.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.509
Fuck.

21:31.398 --> 21:32.930
That were close.

21:33.034 --> 21:34.704
How did he get bored of that?

21:34.808 --> 21:35.504
Fucking prick.

21:35.609 --> 21:36.652
JOE PRITCHARD: What?

21:36.757 --> 21:38.009
Fuck off.

21:38.113 --> 21:39.854
KAREN GALLAGHER: Well, you want a go at me now an' all?

21:39.958 --> 21:41.314
JOE PRITCHARD: What do you think I am?

21:41.419 --> 21:43.436
KAREN GALLAGHER: I don't think--

21:43.541 --> 21:45.628
I know.

21:45.732 --> 21:46.777
Touch Mandy again--

21:46.881 --> 21:50.500
I would never hurt Mandy, never.

21:50.604 --> 21:51.473
Fuck me.

21:51.578 --> 21:52.587
People in glass houses.

21:52.691 --> 21:53.561
You what?

21:53.665 --> 21:55.753
You heard.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.327
I've seen the way you treat Jamie, nipping at his head

21:58.431 --> 21:59.302
all the time.

21:59.406 --> 22:01.737
Lad's a shadow of.

22:01.841 --> 22:04.764
And I don't think you can really make threats now.

22:17.185 --> 22:21.116
Oh see oh see, don't you stop, just set

22:21.220 --> 22:22.856
your feet down to the bishop.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.474
A couple of these and a bucket of ale.

22:33.293 --> 22:36.355
Don't give a toss if you haven't got a tail.

22:36.459 --> 22:41.818
[inaudible] and the wheels go round.

22:41.922 --> 22:44.879
RUBY: Hello?

22:44.983 --> 22:45.923
What? what?

22:46.027 --> 22:46.862
RUBY: Hello?

22:49.193 --> 22:50.028
All right.

22:55.559 --> 22:58.274
You always were a grumpy bitch in the morning.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.544
Oh, Ru.

23:01.649 --> 23:03.248
What you dressed like a politician for?

23:03.354 --> 23:04.745
I run the yard now.

23:04.849 --> 23:07.146
Got to distinguish myself from the drivers somehow.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.476
Oh, jeez.

23:09.581 --> 23:11.111
Well, can I come in?

23:11.216 --> 23:12.329
Oh, yeah.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.964
Sorry, I'm still a bit--

23:22.975 --> 23:24.367
What are you doing?

23:24.472 --> 23:27.743
It came loose.

23:27.847 --> 23:28.681
Fine.

23:28.786 --> 23:30.491
I'll put it back.

23:30.596 --> 23:32.230
No.

23:32.335 --> 23:33.935
Shane's flown the nest.

23:34.040 --> 23:38.597
It's time I started looking after the ones under my nose.

23:38.702 --> 23:40.128
It's good to have you back, Jamie.

23:40.232 --> 23:42.911
Well, let's hope it's not for long, eh?

23:43.016 --> 23:45.521
I'm moving back here at my age?

23:45.625 --> 23:46.460
It's not exactly progress.

23:54.254 --> 23:55.958
Do you want to go home?

23:56.063 --> 23:58.116
I don't--

23:58.220 --> 24:03.508
I don't want it ruining it for us.

24:03.613 --> 24:04.657
It won't.

24:07.996 --> 24:14.119
Sometimes, shit's sent to test us.

24:14.224 --> 24:16.659
We'll get through this. We'll get through owt.

24:19.373 --> 24:20.800
And we will, I promise.

24:24.627 --> 24:27.375
Got a sec?

24:27.479 --> 24:29.324
Practice your p sounds, eh?

24:29.428 --> 24:32.073
puh, puh.

24:32.177 --> 24:33.011
Puh.

24:36.978 --> 24:39.309
Puh.

24:39.413 --> 24:40.561
Fancy giving him a break?

24:40.666 --> 24:41.883
Backlog.

24:41.988 --> 24:43.518
I just want to get somewhere, so he don't lose heart.

24:43.623 --> 24:45.954
Let me crack on for a bit.

24:46.058 --> 24:46.894
Puh.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.330
I've got an idea.

24:53.435 --> 24:56.566
We're going to play a little game of little footie.

24:56.670 --> 24:58.061
Watch the lips.

24:58.166 --> 25:02.550
I want you to put the ball between the puh, puh, puh,

25:02.654 --> 25:04.151
posts.

25:04.255 --> 25:08.221
Use what's left of your imagination.

25:08.326 --> 25:10.900
[whistle blow]

25:12.465 --> 25:13.996
Puh.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.458
Buh. Buh.

25:15.562 --> 25:16.501
Puh.

25:16.606 --> 25:18.032
Puh.

25:18.136 --> 25:19.703
Again. Breathe.

25:19.807 --> 25:21.163
- Buh. - Go on.

25:21.268 --> 25:22.103
Puh.

25:22.207 --> 25:23.111
Puh.

25:23.216 --> 25:25.895
Puh.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.634
Let me help the girls out for a bit.

25:27.739 --> 25:28.852
No.

25:28.957 --> 25:30.070
G-- on more goal.

25:30.174 --> 25:32.540
Come on.

25:32.645 --> 25:34.384
OK.

25:34.488 --> 25:36.054
Go on, big shot.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.063
Puh.

25:37.168 --> 25:40.055
Goal!

25:40.159 --> 25:42.942
Ha, ha.

25:43.048 --> 25:45.901
I fucking love your heart, Shane Maguire.

25:49.205 --> 25:50.910
- Ditto. - Ditto.

25:51.014 --> 25:51.919
Yeah.

25:52.023 --> 25:53.937
Right.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.503
Let's do some work on your t's, eh?

26:10.811 --> 26:11.716
Kettle's boiled.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.690
Sorry.

26:15.404 --> 26:17.665
Like what you've done with the place.

26:17.769 --> 26:19.926
Oh, it's my mother's old stuff.

26:20.031 --> 26:22.919
I never quite got around to throwing it away.

26:23.023 --> 26:24.171
Home from home.

26:24.275 --> 26:26.502
Oh, I'm not that far, actually.

26:26.607 --> 26:30.434
That's my regular gaff over there.

26:30.538 --> 26:31.408
What's going on, Nu?

26:31.512 --> 26:32.381
Nothing.

26:32.487 --> 26:33.878
Everything's grand.

26:33.982 --> 26:35.722
I'm just between--

26:35.827 --> 26:36.696
Between what?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.157
--lives, I suppose.

26:46.473 --> 26:47.516
Did you love her?

26:51.517 --> 26:53.918
Probably too much.

26:54.023 --> 26:55.275
She fucked off, of course.

26:58.302 --> 27:01.364
Lately, I just don't where I'm supposed to be.

27:01.468 --> 27:03.311
I'm like the shit on the shoe of this family,

27:03.417 --> 27:05.399
and they try and scrape us off, but I'm always

27:05.504 --> 27:09.818
fucking there, lingering.

27:09.922 --> 27:12.392
I don't know why I'm still fucking there.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.167
You're not shit.

27:14.271 --> 27:17.194
There's tea on the other end-- almost certainly is.

27:17.298 --> 27:20.986
Come on, let's go back to my place, brew a decent copper,

27:21.091 --> 27:24.222
get you fed, have a shower, maybe.

27:24.326 --> 27:27.910
You're amongst friends, mate.

27:28.014 --> 27:28.884
Cheers.

27:28.988 --> 27:31.563
[music playing]

27:42.974 --> 27:44.574
That's fuck off.

27:44.679 --> 27:46.453
Yes.

27:46.558 --> 27:47.393
Lillian?

27:50.280 --> 27:53.864
Fuck off yourself, skinny bint.

27:53.968 --> 27:55.395
So what's, fuck me, then?

27:57.969 --> 28:01.379
You're living rent free at his place,

28:01.483 --> 28:03.362
and you're charging him for babysitting?

28:03.466 --> 28:05.624
Well, he's a full-time job.

28:05.728 --> 28:07.433
And you don't give a toss where the money

28:07.537 --> 28:09.450
is coming from, or about him?

28:12.582 --> 28:15.783
I think you need to buy this old man a drink, son.

28:15.887 --> 28:16.757
Mark it.

28:16.862 --> 28:17.696
Mark what?

28:20.584 --> 28:22.637
I have never been so proud of you.

28:27.508 --> 28:28.343
Oy, Carl?

28:31.335 --> 28:32.865
Uh-- lager, please?

28:32.970 --> 28:35.650
JAMIE MAGUIRE: All six goals came from us messing up.

28:35.754 --> 28:37.284
We just switched off.

28:37.389 --> 28:38.781
As for fuckwit, here--

28:38.885 --> 28:39.789
Well you can't blame me.

28:39.893 --> 28:42.225
I wasn't even on the pitch.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.242
Any thoughts for the captain?

28:44.347 --> 28:46.748
Well it's obvious where the problem is mate--

28:46.852 --> 28:51.236
spineless, no fight, a bunch of fucking pussies--

28:51.340 --> 28:52.175
Piss off.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.288
Problem, Carlos?

28:53.393 --> 28:54.263
Joe?

28:58.716 --> 29:00.073
Finally-- a reaction.

29:00.177 --> 29:03.100
A bit harder on the pitch, and less hard ons off.

29:03.204 --> 29:04.875
Don't.

29:04.979 --> 29:08.562
My chub's only just gone down.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.206
Still fancy doing something tonight?

29:11.310 --> 29:12.424
Don't want to put you out.

29:12.528 --> 29:13.607
You're not.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.356
Good to get away from here for a bit.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.434
Get me mam to mind Katie.

29:22.861 --> 29:24.288
Take the whole bottle mate.

29:24.392 --> 29:31.351
Not even a text to say he'd slept OK, asked after us.

29:31.455 --> 29:34.343
Selfish slut.

29:34.447 --> 29:36.917
I'm sorry, am I boring you?

29:37.021 --> 29:38.518
Just tired.

29:38.622 --> 29:40.605
You're always tired.

29:40.709 --> 29:42.414
He's only been there a day.

29:42.518 --> 29:44.746
Poor girl's probably got her work cut out.

29:44.850 --> 29:45.858
It's not right.

29:45.964 --> 29:47.286
Sons need their mothers.

29:52.121 --> 29:53.791
What the hell are you doing?

29:53.895 --> 29:55.322
KELLY BALL: Speech therapy.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.976
He's relearning how to make tih sounds.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.715
Already got him p'd.

30:00.819 --> 30:01.689
Making a fool of him.

30:01.793 --> 30:03.846
I'm making him better.

30:03.950 --> 30:05.934
If the boy is improving--

30:06.038 --> 30:07.882
Why are you siding with her all of a sudden?

30:07.987 --> 30:11.918
Just trying to keep the peace.

30:12.022 --> 30:13.935
Whenever you want home, your ma's

30:14.040 --> 30:16.301
hot pot in front of the box--

30:16.405 --> 30:18.146
just say the words.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.676
If he can pronounce it.

30:30.044 --> 30:31.783
What, sweet face?

30:31.889 --> 30:37.142
I just realized you're only doing it-- doing

30:37.246 --> 30:39.229
this to get one over on me mom.

30:39.334 --> 30:41.525
No, I'm not.

30:41.630 --> 30:42.917
OK.

30:43.022 --> 30:44.831
I wanted to prove a point, but I want you to get better.

30:44.935 --> 30:49.006
Because you can't stand seeing me like this.

30:49.110 --> 30:49.841
No.

30:49.945 --> 30:54.225
Stop feeling sorry for me.

30:54.329 --> 30:56.346
I don't want you--

30:56.451 --> 30:58.574
your fucking pity.

31:12.629 --> 31:14.508
Sorry, I dozed off.

31:14.613 --> 31:15.726
You must have needed it.

31:19.623 --> 31:20.631
Anything?

31:20.735 --> 31:21.606
What?

31:21.710 --> 31:22.545
Oh, no.

31:22.650 --> 31:23.798
Just checking the time.

31:23.902 --> 31:25.398
But no messages.

31:25.503 --> 31:26.372
No.

31:32.495 --> 31:33.991
Well, you've done well yourself, Ru.

31:34.096 --> 31:36.740
Look, not design.

31:36.844 --> 31:39.210
I fell about it at auction and then didn't have

31:39.314 --> 31:40.498
the cash to see it through.

31:40.602 --> 31:41.472
It's nice.

31:41.576 --> 31:42.411
Oy.

31:45.507 --> 31:47.908
You're the only person to ever call me Ru.

31:48.013 --> 31:49.474
Do you know that?

31:49.578 --> 31:52.779
A fellow in the office did for a while, but I nipped it.

31:52.883 --> 31:54.658
So when did you come off the lorries?

31:54.762 --> 31:57.267
I was never a [inaudible], Nu.

31:57.371 --> 31:59.181
Driving weren't for me.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.199
Kept getting my nails caught in the pallet.

32:01.303 --> 32:02.590
Ha.

32:02.695 --> 32:04.330
It's funny how things turn out, eh?

32:04.434 --> 32:06.870
Things haven't turned out like anything.

32:06.974 --> 32:08.470
Life's a work in-progress.

32:08.575 --> 32:09.688
You can always make changes.

32:18.107 --> 32:19.290
- What? - You stop it.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.403
You're going to give me an heart attack,

32:20.508 --> 32:23.500
or yourself an amputation.

32:23.605 --> 32:24.857
Sorry.

32:24.961 --> 32:28.545
It's just Shane's skank's taking the piss,

32:28.649 --> 32:30.702
and your dad's on her side.

32:30.807 --> 32:32.824
Jamie can't stand to be here.

32:32.928 --> 32:35.607
It's like it's open season on me.

32:35.713 --> 32:37.556
It's not.

32:37.660 --> 32:39.400
You say anything to please people--

32:39.505 --> 32:40.722
have done all your life.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.184
No I don't.

32:42.288 --> 32:46.463
You don't know nothing about me, how I'm feeling, who I'm with--

32:46.567 --> 32:47.715
you haven't got a clue.

32:47.819 --> 32:50.846
Twist the knife, son.

32:50.951 --> 32:53.074
I'm not having a go, but will you stop

32:53.178 --> 32:54.987
feeling sorry for yourself.

32:55.091 --> 32:56.518
You're supposed to be our mom.

33:00.727 --> 33:02.015
Yeah.

33:02.119 --> 33:03.824
You're right.

33:03.928 --> 33:08.520
And while I'm here, that junkie's giving my Shane rehab.

33:08.625 --> 33:10.017
I brought him into this world.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.383
I can give him life again.

33:12.487 --> 33:14.261
Nobody loves her son like he's mom.

33:17.044 --> 33:19.654
Ever talk to me like that again, and you'll be

33:19.759 --> 33:20.907
gargling with your testicles.

33:21.011 --> 33:21.881
Right?

33:21.985 --> 33:22.994
Right.

33:34.510 --> 33:49.958
[sighs] [inaudible]

33:50.062 --> 33:51.175
Oh, my baby.

33:54.377 --> 33:56.081
Oh, my baby.

33:56.186 --> 33:58.482
Oh, who's there?

33:58.586 --> 34:02.134
You think that's making my son better?

34:02.239 --> 34:03.596
Think?

34:03.700 --> 34:04.918
Shane's resting.

34:05.023 --> 34:07.284
On the fucking floor!

34:07.389 --> 34:09.024
I'm taking him home for some normality.

34:09.128 --> 34:10.937
It's very normal at your house.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.824
Get that in order, before you come around here cursing me.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.295
You're a smackhead slag, living

34:16.400 --> 34:18.277
in a fucking knocking shop.

34:18.382 --> 34:19.670
How's hubby doing?

34:19.774 --> 34:21.827
You pull me up for neglecting Shane,

34:21.931 --> 34:24.924
while your man's wasting away in front of your very eyes.

34:25.027 --> 34:26.315
He's got a bug.

34:26.418 --> 34:27.706
And I'm Mary Poppins.

34:27.811 --> 34:29.829
Nice to fucking meet ya.

34:29.933 --> 34:31.569
Take the blinkers off, Mimi.

34:31.672 --> 34:33.621
You poisonous bitch.

34:33.725 --> 34:35.674
I'm going to fucking kill you.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.031
He's a smackhead.

34:37.135 --> 34:38.944
That's why he's so wasted.

34:39.047 --> 34:40.406
I seen him.

34:40.510 --> 34:43.502
I had to help, he was so desperate.

34:43.606 --> 34:45.275
Oh, you think all that--

34:45.380 --> 34:48.652
mother fucking superior.

34:48.755 --> 34:49.938
Your family's in bits.

34:52.444 --> 34:55.818
Maybe you should take a look in the mirror.

34:55.922 --> 34:56.931
Enough.

35:10.570 --> 35:13.423
RUBY: I've got a spare room.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.337
You could move in here until you get

35:15.441 --> 35:18.364
yourself sorted out, or longer.

35:18.468 --> 35:19.616
Oh, look--

35:19.720 --> 35:21.181
I don't think I'm ready for that Ru, it's a bit--

35:21.286 --> 35:22.539
Hey, I'm not proposing.

35:22.643 --> 35:24.905
There's no civil ceremony on the cards.

35:25.009 --> 35:27.513
I'm just trying to help out--

35:27.618 --> 35:29.949
no strings.

35:30.054 --> 35:31.688
Why are you doing this?

35:31.793 --> 35:34.020
As I recall, when we split up, you weren't too happy.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.447
You popped me cherry, no--

35:39.552 --> 35:42.230
at least my dike cherry.

35:42.335 --> 35:45.918
It was a bit of a confusing time.

35:46.023 --> 35:49.328
I know I behaved like a dick-- don't we all?

35:55.521 --> 35:56.634
You've nothing to worry about.

35:59.661 --> 36:02.062
I don't believe in love.

36:02.166 --> 36:05.715
It becomes a dead weight around your neck before long.

36:05.819 --> 36:09.055
I look after me these days, and if there's

36:09.159 --> 36:14.239
a bit of something along the way, then all the better.

36:29.373 --> 36:30.243
Three.

36:39.915 --> 36:45.378
I know I've been a numpty and pushy.

36:45.482 --> 36:48.509
I just wanted you back faster.

36:48.613 --> 36:53.832
I'd love you if you were laying mute and seeing 10 of me.

36:53.936 --> 36:55.711
Two is more than enough.

36:59.329 --> 37:02.217
So are we mates again?

37:02.321 --> 37:03.539
I forgive you.

37:03.643 --> 37:04.618
Fuck off.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.878
Let me have a shit in peace, will you?

37:12.271 --> 37:13.385
Shh, shh, shit.

37:50.577 --> 37:53.048
I thought you were with Shane.

37:53.152 --> 37:54.613
That's not what you think.

37:54.718 --> 37:56.353
I'm sick of hearing lies.

37:56.457 --> 37:59.623
It wasn't my fault.

37:59.727 --> 38:02.197
Don't get high on your own supply--

38:02.302 --> 38:03.659
golden rule.

38:03.763 --> 38:05.885
That's what separates us from them.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.999
I fucked up.

38:09.886 --> 38:11.000
Never went to Spain.

38:11.104 --> 38:12.426
Never even got on the flight.

38:12.531 --> 38:17.958
They shafted us-- stuck a hit over my head,

38:18.063 --> 38:26.413
and tortured me, on our remaining children's lives.

38:26.517 --> 38:27.387
I want names.

38:27.491 --> 38:29.613
They're long gone.

38:29.718 --> 38:30.971
Very convenient.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.083
They tricked me.

38:35.529 --> 38:38.660
Pumped me full of smack till I was hooked, and tossed me

38:38.764 --> 38:44.748
on the street with this fucking curse,

38:44.852 --> 38:47.357
to remind me of how stupid I was.

38:47.461 --> 38:50.871
Drug dealers don't shove needles in the competition

38:50.975 --> 38:54.002
for no reason.

38:54.107 --> 38:55.324
Please, believe me.

39:06.771 --> 39:09.276
I don't know anything, anymore.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.129
Don't know who my kids are, if they're happy or not.

39:14.634 --> 39:15.504
Why?

39:18.461 --> 39:21.349
I don't know what shit you're in, but you're clearly lying.

39:24.237 --> 39:27.124
I'm not.

39:27.228 --> 39:30.395
I don't know who I am.

39:30.499 --> 39:32.517
When did I become surplus to requirements?

39:35.196 --> 39:37.074
Is this is my fault?

39:37.179 --> 39:40.032
Am I to blame?

39:40.137 --> 39:40.971
No.

39:43.477 --> 39:44.346
Jesus, no.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.384
[music playing]

39:52.488 --> 39:56.523
So what do you make of Joe, then, really?

39:56.627 --> 39:57.915
He's nice.

39:58.019 --> 39:59.759
You weren't saying that yesterday.

39:59.863 --> 40:02.577
You said he was bossing me.

40:02.681 --> 40:04.630
God, how strong is that?

40:04.734 --> 40:07.309
Karen?

40:07.413 --> 40:10.370
Well, considering my current circumstances,

40:10.475 --> 40:12.354
I am not really the best judge.

40:15.102 --> 40:20.182
Come on, bloke-free night, remember?

40:20.286 --> 40:21.121
Woo!

40:29.436 --> 40:33.577
[phone buzzing]

40:33.681 --> 40:34.899
RUBY: Anything important?

40:35.003 --> 40:37.334
It's Just Liam.

40:37.438 --> 40:39.421
He wants to know if I've seen the remote for the telly.

40:39.525 --> 40:40.569
Cheeky bastard.

40:44.083 --> 40:45.441
You know what you were saying earlier

40:45.545 --> 40:47.563
about not believing in love--

40:47.667 --> 40:49.580
did you mean that?

40:49.685 --> 40:52.851
You're born alone and you die alone.

40:52.956 --> 40:55.321
Anything else is just a romantic notion.

40:55.426 --> 41:00.401
Well maybe, but living with no hope.

41:00.506 --> 41:02.384
Look after number one--

41:02.488 --> 41:04.367
you don't need to rely on hope.

41:04.471 --> 41:07.255
Well, I'm not the world's greatest optimist,

41:07.360 --> 41:08.856
but that's a bit of a cold outlook.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.465
RUBY: Kept you warm enough earlier on.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.900
It's like shutting down a whole area

41:14.005 --> 41:15.466
of life for yourself.

41:20.928 --> 41:22.912
You're not replying?

41:23.016 --> 41:24.198
Well, I know where it is.

41:34.045 --> 41:34.810
Not now.

41:34.914 --> 41:36.376
I'm not here to fight.

41:36.480 --> 41:40.934
I said some stuff you just don't say, so I--

41:41.038 --> 41:43.300
- Me. - Yeah.

41:43.404 --> 41:45.178
Well the mother-in-law, kind of.

41:53.355 --> 41:55.442
I went too far.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.590
Sorry.

42:01.635 --> 42:04.626
Is he in?

42:04.730 --> 42:06.471
And does he know that you know?

42:06.575 --> 42:08.767
Oh yeah.

42:08.871 --> 42:10.054
It's for the best.

42:10.159 --> 42:11.550
You don't want to do this by yourself.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.499
Fucking gobshite-- none of your business.

42:13.603 --> 42:14.751
Keep your voice down.

42:14.855 --> 42:15.725
Don't blame her.

42:15.829 --> 42:17.013
At least she had the bottle to say.

42:17.117 --> 42:19.413
Where you going?

42:19.517 --> 42:21.883
Just let me do it my way.

42:21.987 --> 42:24.006
I'll wean myself off. - Christ.

42:24.110 --> 42:27.937
I hate this as much as you, but I've been away too long.

42:28.041 --> 42:29.363
Rivals are circling.

42:29.468 --> 42:31.138
And I can't stay at home waiting for this to pass.

42:31.242 --> 42:32.982
We've survived worse than this.

42:33.086 --> 42:34.165
There is no worse than this.

42:34.269 --> 42:36.113
This family needs you.

42:36.217 --> 42:37.852
I won't be long.

42:37.957 --> 42:39.767
Fine. Go.

42:39.871 --> 42:40.879
And don't come back.

42:47.524 --> 42:48.395
Go to bed, Paddy.

42:48.499 --> 42:50.413
You can sleep through it.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.431
You need us.

42:56.535 --> 42:58.171
Think about it.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.388
You know how this ends.

43:15.219 --> 43:17.480
Should have let the bastard go.

43:17.585 --> 43:18.837
He's trying.

43:18.942 --> 43:20.924
There's still a chance.

43:21.029 --> 43:22.769
He's had his chance.

43:22.873 --> 43:26.179
I know you feel betrayed, but all the time you sit

43:26.283 --> 43:29.449
here stewing, is time wasted.

43:29.553 --> 43:32.720
You can help him, but you have to act now.

43:38.217 --> 43:40.130
[laughter]

43:40.234 --> 43:41.556
- Nearly there now. - Right.

43:41.661 --> 43:42.530
This way.

43:42.635 --> 43:44.131
Oh, man down.

43:44.235 --> 43:46.044
Oh for fuck's sake.

43:46.149 --> 43:47.819
There we go.

43:47.923 --> 43:48.793
Right.

43:48.897 --> 43:49.732
Sit down.

43:49.837 --> 43:50.532
Right.

43:50.637 --> 43:51.785
Jamie, fetch her a brew.

43:57.595 --> 43:59.683
Good night, then?

43:59.787 --> 44:00.622
You?

44:00.727 --> 44:01.701
No, it was quiet.

44:01.805 --> 44:02.744
Did you miss us?

44:02.849 --> 44:05.389
Obviously.

44:05.493 --> 44:06.919
I bet.

44:07.024 --> 44:09.981
So Joe, when's our next match?

44:10.085 --> 44:11.024
It's a week Saturday.

44:11.129 --> 44:13.460
Why, are you going to pop down?

44:13.565 --> 44:17.357
Will I get to come in the changing room?

44:17.461 --> 44:19.270
No fun otherwise.

44:19.375 --> 44:20.767
No fun at all.

44:20.871 --> 44:24.524
Their arses aren't exactly premiership standard.

44:24.629 --> 44:27.029
Who's looking at the arses?

44:27.133 --> 44:29.812
Behave.

44:29.916 --> 44:31.030
Going make me?

44:39.832 --> 44:41.642
What?

44:41.746 --> 44:44.146
I'm only messing with him.

44:44.251 --> 44:46.582
You're all right with that, aren't you, Joe?

44:46.686 --> 44:47.521
Yeah.

44:47.626 --> 44:48.809
You two get off.

44:48.913 --> 44:49.783
I'll see to her.

44:49.887 --> 44:52.532
- What, you? - Right.

44:52.636 --> 44:55.106
I think we should call it a night and go back to mine.

44:55.210 --> 44:56.220
Maybe I should stay.

45:01.229 --> 45:03.143
See you tomorrow, Karen.

45:03.248 --> 45:04.570
Yep.

45:04.674 --> 45:06.170
JAMIE MAGUIRE: Right.

45:06.275 --> 45:07.527
Let's get you upstairs, eh?

45:07.631 --> 45:09.963
Fuck off.

45:10.067 --> 45:11.389
I can walk.

45:14.903 --> 45:18.521
Hey, hey, put your arm around me.

45:32.994 --> 45:36.091
You got a diary full of appointments?

45:36.195 --> 45:37.413
No.

45:37.517 --> 45:38.457
I'm going home.

45:38.561 --> 45:39.396
Eh?

45:42.388 --> 45:43.745
Where?

45:43.850 --> 45:44.962
To them.

45:45.066 --> 45:46.111
To the kids.

45:46.216 --> 45:49.451
You're happy just to be a doormat.

45:49.555 --> 45:54.774
There are moments, tiny maybe, but good ones.

45:57.661 --> 45:58.775
I'd like to leave me gear in the yard

45:58.879 --> 46:00.236
though, you know, just in case.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.369
You're always welcome.

46:13.700 --> 46:16.275
FRANK GALLAGHER: The only place Stella actually settles

46:16.380 --> 46:17.701
is the Jockey.

46:17.806 --> 46:20.345
It doesn't mean you have to sit in there all day

46:20.450 --> 46:21.563
pissing away the housekeeping.

46:21.668 --> 46:23.408
It's a business, not a shelter.

46:23.512 --> 46:24.799
What are we going to do for food?

46:24.903 --> 46:28.034
How are we going to feed Stella?

46:28.139 --> 46:32.558
NORMA STARKEY: With my money from the lorries.

46:32.662 --> 46:33.776
I'm home.

46:33.880 --> 46:35.550
Oh yeah, Norma left.

46:39.830 --> 46:42.264
I love you.

46:42.369 --> 46:46.439
I'll even put up with this shit, because my heart is here,

46:46.544 --> 46:48.318
and that's what matters.

46:48.423 --> 46:54.372
I think you'll find names on leases, matters more, legally.

46:54.476 --> 46:56.634
NORMA STARKEY: All I'm asking for is a shelf in the fridge,

46:56.738 --> 46:58.964
some space for me shite round the bath,

46:59.069 --> 47:02.618
and just maybe a bit of sensitivity, now and then.

47:05.088 --> 47:09.784
In return, I'll chip in a quarter of me take home.

47:09.889 --> 47:14.238
I've got a 12:30 kick-off.

47:14.342 --> 47:16.744
[baby crying]

47:34.139 --> 47:34.974
Missed you.

47:37.723 --> 47:40.193
Missed you.

47:40.297 --> 47:41.724
God, you're easily bought, son.

47:43.637 --> 47:44.994
MICKY MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): We all need

47:45.099 --> 47:46.560
a hand, every now and again.

47:50.735 --> 47:52.127
Some more than others and--

47:52.231 --> 47:53.344
You're getting there.

47:53.448 --> 47:54.353
MICKY MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): --whether

47:54.457 --> 47:54.980
we like it or fucking not--

47:55.084 --> 47:56.092
Fuck

47:56.197 --> 47:57.519
MICKY MAGUIRE (VOICEOVER): --whether it's

47:57.623 --> 47:58.981
having to struggle little bits of hair

47:59.085 --> 48:05.869
held up when we're throwing up, being like hugged

48:05.974 --> 48:07.156
when we feel shit.

48:10.218 --> 48:12.758
Nobody can get by on their own.

48:12.862 --> 48:15.437
[music playing]

48:59.901 --> 49:01.814
[inaudible]

49:01.919 --> 49:02.754
Whoa!

49:02.858 --> 49:03.623
Oh my--

49:03.728 --> 49:07.137
Lock on the door costs extra.

49:07.242 --> 49:08.599
Oh you dirty--

49:08.703 --> 49:11.347
oh, you're fucking me.

49:11.452 --> 49:13.434
In your dreams.
