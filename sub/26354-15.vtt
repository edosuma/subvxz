00:20.718 --> 00:22.638
Gene, Tina, hurry up.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.476
Those eggs aren't gonna eat themselves.

00:24.484 --> 00:27.068
But they will eat this
bacon. Eat it. Eat it!

00:27.093 --> 00:28.639
I'm leaving for school in three minutes

00:28.664 --> 00:30.374
with or without you,
and I'm the only one

00:30.399 --> 00:31.789
- who knows the way.
- We know the way.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.830
You turn left where that
cloud looks like a dolphin.

00:33.855 --> 00:35.855
Louise, what's the big
rush to get to school?

00:35.880 --> 00:38.187
Because I only get to
be principal for one day,

00:38.212 --> 00:39.633
and I don't want to miss a minute of it.

00:39.658 --> 00:41.492
Oh, yeah, your big prize.

00:41.517 --> 00:43.977
For selling the most candy
bars in that school thing.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.132
My little Glengarry Glen Louise.

00:46.157 --> 00:48.197
I busted my ass hawking that choc.

00:48.230 --> 00:50.190
And possibly broke some laws.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.969
Four bucks for a candy bar?

00:52.994 --> 00:55.704
I can get you onto
Sweet Street for three.

00:56.729 --> 00:58.581
Instead of a dumb tip for my mom,

00:58.606 --> 01:00.986
how about some chocolate for your mom?

01:01.011 --> 01:03.681
Chocolate bars! Get your chocolate bars!

01:03.706 --> 01:06.432
Very unofficial treat of the Wonderdogs.

01:06.457 --> 01:07.827
Hello. Bye!

01:07.852 --> 01:09.692
Wait a minute. You sold me so many.

01:09.717 --> 01:12.387
And I'm beginning to think
there never was a golden ticket.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.912
So, sweetie, what are
you gonna do as principal?

01:14.937 --> 01:16.643
Oh, you know, abuse my power

01:16.668 --> 01:18.208
- to the fullest extent.
- Cool.

01:18.237 --> 01:21.107
But my number-one goal?
The Cabinet of Confiscation.

01:21.132 --> 01:23.172
What's the Cabinet of Confiscation?

01:23.197 --> 01:26.487
It's a year's worth of priceless
loot confiscated from students.

01:26.512 --> 01:29.772
All in one place:
Principal Spoors' office.

01:29.797 --> 01:32.119
The fidget spinners
alone are worth millions.

01:32.144 --> 01:34.064
We're talking inappropriate comic books,

01:34.089 --> 01:36.049
fireworks, fake vomit.

01:36.074 --> 01:37.180
That's my favorite kind of vomit.

01:37.205 --> 01:38.789
Um, Louise, I guess something else

01:38.821 --> 01:40.611
you could get out of being principal

01:40.636 --> 01:43.926
is learning about, you know,
leadership and responsibility.

01:43.951 --> 01:46.245
Oh.

01:46.270 --> 01:49.376
Uh, yeah, I agree. Good stuff, Bob.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.878
Uh, I'm the good parent.
Everyone remember that.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.924
Let's roll! I'm driving.

01:54.393 --> 01:55.699
Morning, Ms. Schnur.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.985
Coffee, two sugars.
Actually, seven sugars.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.471
You know what? Just make it sugar.

01:59.504 --> 02:01.189
- Excuse me?
- We're about to dive into

02:01.214 --> 02:02.964
my First Hundred Minutes agenda,

02:02.989 --> 02:05.289
so you may want to hit the
bathroom before we start.

02:05.314 --> 02:07.484
First off, I only go at home.

02:07.509 --> 02:10.133
Kids aren't the only ones who
have trouble going at school.

02:10.158 --> 02:12.079
Second, I don't work for you, Louise.

02:12.104 --> 02:14.401
How about a little less chitchat, babe?

02:15.064 --> 02:17.144
- Weird.
- There she is.

02:17.169 --> 02:18.759
Principal for a Day.

02:18.894 --> 02:20.104
Uh, why is my door locked?

02:20.194 --> 02:21.774
- Your door?
- Principal?

02:21.799 --> 02:24.259
You know you're not
really principal, right?

02:24.284 --> 02:28.114
- It's a ceremonial role.
- Ceremonial?

02:28.139 --> 02:29.525
You get to supervise the flag-raising,

02:29.550 --> 02:30.970
water the school plant,

02:30.995 --> 02:32.745
phone in today's
attendance to the district.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.830
That's a fun voice mail to leave.

02:34.994 --> 02:36.850
Ordinarily, Principal Spoors

02:36.874 --> 02:38.164
would walk you through your day,

02:38.189 --> 02:40.439
but he's attending a
leadership conference.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.849
Leadership.

02:41.874 --> 02:43.294
- Wha... ?
- Nothing.

02:43.319 --> 02:45.479
All right. Let's get this
crap show on the road.

02:45.504 --> 02:46.884
I've got counseling to do.

02:46.909 --> 02:48.459
I'm breaking in a new therapy doll:

02:48.484 --> 02:50.614
Online Shamin' Damon.

02:58.538 --> 03:01.619
Whew! What a full day
of being principal.

03:01.644 --> 03:04.694
It's only 9:15. I
haven't done anything yet.

03:04.719 --> 03:06.639
You still have the
flag-lowering at 3:00,

03:06.664 --> 03:09.004
so get your backpack and go be

03:09.029 --> 03:10.954
a regular below-average
student for six hours.

03:10.979 --> 03:12.960
What a rip-off!

03:17.164 --> 03:20.044
Ms. Schnur, do you have
a bobby pin I can borrow?

03:20.069 --> 03:21.199
Like, this one?

03:21.224 --> 03:23.570
I could probably spare that one.

03:23.595 --> 03:25.595
Ooh, that's a nice paper clip.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.620
- You've got taste, lady.
- Thank you.

03:27.645 --> 03:32.109
Ms. Schnur, your nephew...
Has he done anything lately?

03:32.134 --> 03:34.014
Nathan? Oh, my God.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.249
- Where to begin?
- Just begin.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.789
He got into magic camp, this kid.

03:37.814 --> 03:39.194
- Mmm.
- Not the sleepover one.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.202
Uh, he's got some issues, but...

03:42.274 --> 03:43.644
Hi, Teddy.

03:43.669 --> 03:44.709
Why are you, um...

03:44.734 --> 03:46.210
Do you...  do you need something?

03:46.234 --> 03:47.444
No, uh, just watching.

03:47.469 --> 03:49.269
Sometimes I pretend this
cutout is a TV screen

03:49.294 --> 03:52.089
and I'm watching a cooking
show called Mustache Kitchen.

03:52.114 --> 03:53.824
- Ooh, I'd watch that.
- Uh...

03:53.849 --> 03:55.155
I mean, they're-they're hit or miss,

03:55.180 --> 03:56.560
but this episode's pretty good.

03:56.585 --> 03:58.712
Bob's flipping burgers,
moving stuff around.

03:58.737 --> 04:01.060
-Oh, my God.
-Where'd you learn your spatula technique?

04:01.084 --> 04:03.714
I mean, is it all in the
wrist? Your delicate wrists?

04:03.739 --> 04:05.409
Or the forearm? How do you do it?

04:05.434 --> 04:08.439
I-I don't know. I mean, I don't
really, uh, think about it.

04:08.464 --> 04:11.004
I just, uh, do it, I think.

04:11.029 --> 04:12.239
Oops. Huh.

04:12.264 --> 04:14.181
- Huh...  - Huh,
that's-that's weird.

04:14.206 --> 04:16.724
All right, um, this
next flip will be fine.

04:16.844 --> 04:18.764
Oh, crap, I broke that one in half.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.039
Bob, what's going on?

04:20.064 --> 04:21.829
- What'd you do to those burgers?
- I don't know.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.524
I was fine, then Teddy started asking me

04:23.549 --> 04:25.144
stupid questions and got me...

04:25.234 --> 04:26.330
- Not stupid.
- Thinking about it,

04:26.354 --> 04:27.944
and now I can't flip a burger.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.729
No, no, no, Teddy.
Don't ask Bob questions.

04:30.754 --> 04:32.169
His brain's not built for that.

04:32.194 --> 04:33.904
When I met him, he could tie a tie.

04:33.994 --> 04:35.494
Then I asked him to show me how,

04:35.574 --> 04:37.284
and he couldn't tie
a tie for five years.

04:37.414 --> 04:40.084
Boy, this is a really
interesting Mustache Kitchen.

04:40.204 --> 04:42.414
And then last month, Nathan entered

04:42.544 --> 04:43.914
the New Yorker caption contest...

04:44.044 --> 04:45.544
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- And was robbed,

04:45.674 --> 04:48.054
in my opinion and everyone's opinion.

04:48.134 --> 04:50.264
- Cabinet of Confiscation.
- The winning one

04:50.384 --> 04:53.004
- was not even good.
- Combination lock? No!

04:53.134 --> 04:54.884
What are you doing in here?

04:55.014 --> 04:57.054
I'm being the fricking principal.

04:57.184 --> 04:58.304
But you're not, though.

04:58.394 --> 04:59.530
My God, Spoors' private bathroom.

04:59.554 --> 05:01.144
I've never seen the inside.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.789
Spoors doesn't share his bathroom

05:02.814 --> 05:05.434
with his poor secretary
with the shy bladder?

05:05.524 --> 05:08.144
It's not my bladder. But no, he doesn't.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.364
Ms. Schnur, I'm here. You're here.

05:10.389 --> 05:13.089
The bathroom is here. And
Principal Spoors isn't.

05:13.114 --> 05:15.938
So why don't you tell me
the combination to that lock?

05:15.963 --> 05:19.464
- Only Spoors knows it.
- Ugh! All right.

05:19.489 --> 05:22.059
Pivoting to the rest of my agenda.

05:22.084 --> 05:24.452
Ah. I would like some blank

05:24.477 --> 05:26.519
"from the office of the
principal" letterhead.

05:26.544 --> 05:28.829
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.854 --> 05:31.860
How about you enjoy some
time in the private bathroom

05:31.885 --> 05:34.765
while I enjoy some time cranking
out some very official memos.

05:34.964 --> 05:36.094
Everybody wins.

05:36.174 --> 05:37.764
The toilet loses.

05:37.844 --> 05:39.885
There's a stack of
letterhead in that drawer.

05:39.910 --> 05:41.949
Looks like we've both
got some work to do.

05:41.974 --> 05:45.854
See you on the other
side...  Principal Louise.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.914
Check it out, peeps. New class schedule.

05:51.944 --> 05:53.944
Straight from the principal's office.

05:54.074 --> 05:56.614
Double recess? No more study hall?

05:56.654 --> 05:59.104
How do you like our
educational system now, Norway?

05:59.129 --> 06:02.838
And double lunch. Now I can chew
my food like I'm supposed to.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.834
Wow. Louise is actually doing it.

06:04.874 --> 06:06.414
If she's really gonna be the principal,

06:06.439 --> 06:08.899
I'm gonna be the prance-able.

06:08.924 --> 06:12.109
Now I can drive Uber for
15 minutes instead of ten.

06:12.134 --> 06:13.544
Wh-What's all the hubbub?

06:13.729 --> 06:15.324
Louise can't do this.

06:15.349 --> 06:17.649
It's "from the office of the principal."

06:17.674 --> 06:19.224
It looks official, right?

06:19.249 --> 06:22.069
If we want it to, which we do.

06:22.094 --> 06:23.764
She's gone rogue.

06:23.789 --> 06:26.619
- No prancing in the hall!
- Ah, boo.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.119
Bob, we're getting

06:28.144 --> 06:29.064
a little behind here.

06:29.144 --> 06:30.774
This one guy's been waiting.

06:30.799 --> 06:32.599
I'm running out of
excuses, so I told him

06:32.624 --> 06:34.754
our regular chef is away
and you're his dumb twin.

06:34.779 --> 06:36.424
I'm doing my best, Lin.

06:37.219 --> 06:38.469
Damn it!

06:38.494 --> 06:40.354
Bob, I-I think I know what this is.

06:40.379 --> 06:42.759
- You've got the yips.
- Yips? What are yips?

06:42.784 --> 06:44.814
They're a mental block
that pro athletes get.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.969
Like that baseball catcher
who got so in his head,

06:46.994 --> 06:49.204
he couldn't even throw the
ball back to the pitcher.

06:49.229 --> 06:51.899
He had to walk it back
while everyone booed.

06:51.931 --> 06:53.609
Flip yips!

06:53.634 --> 06:55.874
Flipping burgers is literally
the only thing I'm good at.

06:55.924 --> 06:58.594
Teddy, what do those sports guys
with the yips do to get better?

06:58.634 --> 06:59.990
Oh, there's all kinds of therapies.

07:00.014 --> 07:02.764
They change their grip,
do breathing exercises,

07:02.789 --> 07:05.029
hypnosis, but mostly
they retire in shame

07:05.054 --> 07:06.354
'cause none of that stuff works.

07:06.394 --> 07:08.224
Oh, crap.

07:08.314 --> 07:11.104
Ah...  I just came over here
for some peace and quiet.

07:11.129 --> 07:14.499
My restaurant's packed and loud. Zoom!

07:14.524 --> 07:17.444
- Go away, Jimmy.
- Yeah, go away. It's a bad time.

07:17.469 --> 07:19.389
So, like, uh, every day?

07:19.422 --> 07:21.144
Nothing's going on with
Bob, that's for sure.

07:21.169 --> 07:23.469
Oh, yeah, Bob looks sweatier than usual.

07:23.494 --> 07:25.124
What, is he having a baby back there?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.494
- Bob's got the yips, Jimmy.
- Lin, stop.

07:27.519 --> 07:29.519
He can't flip a burger,
but we still love him.

07:29.544 --> 07:31.504
Bob's got yips!

07:31.529 --> 07:33.989
Like that, uh, catcher
I used to boo. Hilarious.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.536
-Can I get a burger?
-Ooh, geez. I don't know. Can he, Bob?

07:37.561 --> 07:39.419
Hey, yip yip yip yip yip yip
yip yip yip yip yip yip yip!

07:40.325 --> 07:41.594
Yeah, you have the go-ahead.

07:41.674 --> 07:43.200
You can start building
the pool right away.

07:43.224 --> 07:45.344
And we're gonna go
with three crazy slides.

07:45.434 --> 07:46.934
I don't want sane slides.

07:47.014 --> 07:49.104
Okay, Principal Louise. Fun's over.

07:49.184 --> 07:51.814
Uh, my office hours aren't
till this afternoon, Phillip.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.334
Oh, I guess I could come back...  No!

07:53.394 --> 07:55.104
What am I saying? Get out of that chair.

07:55.194 --> 07:58.064
Why don't you have a lollipop
and we'll talk this over.

07:58.154 --> 08:00.234
Talking it over, no. Lollipop, yes.

08:00.284 --> 08:02.654
Well, I'm not budging
from this seat, so...

08:02.679 --> 08:04.969
Just roll with it, Louise.

08:04.994 --> 08:07.324
Damn it. This is lime, not sour apple.

08:09.059 --> 08:11.059
You're not supposed
to go in that bathroom.

08:11.084 --> 08:12.954
- How was it?
- Paradise.

08:12.979 --> 08:14.439
Where's Principal Louise?

08:14.464 --> 08:16.254
There is no Principal Louise.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.989
Attention, faculty and students.

08:18.014 --> 08:21.189
This is Principal Louise.
Recess is now tripled.

08:21.214 --> 08:23.070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:23.094 --> 08:24.134
Louise, what if...

08:24.184 --> 08:26.024
- we turn PE into...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:26.049 --> 08:29.579
Oh, and PE will now be
sensual reggae dance hour.

08:29.604 --> 08:30.494
Mm!

08:30.534 --> 08:32.789
Ooh, Louise, can it be Wacky Hat Day?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.789
Oh, it's just that, Gene,
where are people supposed

08:34.813 --> 08:36.234
to get hats on short notice?

08:36.313 --> 08:37.693
Please give me this!

08:37.774 --> 08:41.443
- It's Wacky Hat Day.
- Yes!

08:41.484 --> 08:44.654
- Louise, Mr. Frond is coming.
- Also, Mr. Frond has hidden

08:44.704 --> 08:46.624
a five-dollar bill in his shoe.

08:46.744 --> 08:49.164
First student to get it out
of there can take it home!

08:49.204 --> 08:52.664
- I don't have money in my shoes!
- Give it to me!

08:52.754 --> 08:55.804
She's getting away!

08:56.656 --> 08:59.464
New policy. Henceforth, all
teachers have to speak...

08:59.544 --> 09:02.424
"Have to speak with an
Italian accent." Cool.

09:02.449 --> 09:05.859
"Passing notes is allowed."
Nice. That's my medium.

09:05.884 --> 09:09.320
"Gum chewing is now a class."
Oh, my God, I might graduate.

09:10.468 --> 09:11.949
First lunch is over.

09:11.974 --> 09:15.184
Second lunch begins. Bon appetoots!

09:15.314 --> 09:19.104
♪ ♪

09:19.129 --> 09:21.364
Attention! All tetherballs 
shall be untethered

09:21.404 --> 09:24.697
- and set free!
- It's chaos.

09:24.721 --> 09:26.283
_

09:26.284 --> 09:28.284
I'm Tammy, and I'm here with Louise,

09:28.414 --> 09:30.334
our popular Principal for a Day.

09:30.374 --> 09:33.084
I'm also popular. Did you
think I would ever talk to you?

09:33.164 --> 09:36.809
Of course I hoped not, Tammy,
but I'm everyone's principal.

09:36.939 --> 09:38.649
Hmm. Jocelyn is in the hall,

09:38.674 --> 09:40.384
getting some reactions to your day.

09:40.409 --> 09:41.949
I'm passing some of my best notes.

09:42.094 --> 09:45.054
Yeah, Zeke's on fire. Highly quotable.

09:45.174 --> 09:47.304
Wacky Hat Day has been a huge success,

09:47.384 --> 09:48.804
despite what you might have heard!

09:48.884 --> 09:50.434
The scores on the quiz I gave today

09:50.514 --> 09:51.934
were the highest of the year.

09:52.014 --> 09:54.684
I think the extra recess
really helped the kids focus.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.404
- What did I get?
- Let's talk off the air.

09:56.484 --> 09:57.494
Oh.

10:00.194 --> 10:01.944
The news studio.

10:02.089 --> 10:04.839
You can't go in there. The light is on.

10:04.864 --> 10:06.324
Ah! I've got you! I...

10:06.499 --> 10:08.379
Where's Louise? She was just on TV.

10:08.404 --> 10:10.064
She left already. We're not live.

10:10.089 --> 10:12.219
We're, like, on a delay,
in case kids swear.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.624
- Damn it!
- Yeah, like that.

10:14.664 --> 10:16.084
You know what, Schnur?

10:16.164 --> 10:18.454
I kind of got into this
principal thing for myself,

10:18.544 --> 10:22.214
but I feel like I'm actually
helping people? Is that crazy?

10:22.239 --> 10:24.109
The amount you
have done in one day.

10:24.134 --> 10:26.804
- And the amount you've done.
- Thank you.

10:26.844 --> 10:29.094
Hey-oh. Looking for Principal Spoors.

10:29.184 --> 10:31.024
- You're not him.
- No, I am not.

10:31.054 --> 10:32.514
I know that because you're a kid.

10:32.644 --> 10:34.724
And because Principal
Spoors is my brother-in-law.

10:34.814 --> 10:37.694
- Who is that?
- I'm Don, the new guidance counselor.

10:37.719 --> 10:40.789
But we already have a
guidance counselor, Mr. Frond.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, that's probably
the guy getting fired

10:42.024 --> 10:43.274
so I can have his job.

10:43.314 --> 10:45.094
Mr. Frond's getting fired?

10:45.119 --> 10:46.129
Am I dreaming?

10:46.154 --> 10:47.864
You're real, right?

10:47.904 --> 10:50.943
- Oh, I try to keep it real.
- Yeah, you do.

10:53.497 --> 10:55.482
So you're Principal
Spoors' brother-in-law?

10:55.507 --> 10:58.124
Yeah. He married my sister.
Or I married his sister.

10:58.149 --> 11:00.545
Anyway, one of those sisters
nagged him into giving me a job.

11:00.584 --> 11:04.083
Oy, Spoors always picks days
he's out for people to be fired.

11:04.108 --> 11:06.424
Then he makes me do it. Wimp.

11:06.449 --> 11:08.739
You're gonna fire Mr. Frond right now?

11:08.764 --> 11:10.974
Can, uh, I watch?

11:11.054 --> 11:13.474
First, Mr. Frond has to
give Don his orientation.

11:14.153 --> 11:16.119
The fired person
orients the hired person

11:16.144 --> 11:18.144
before they know they're fired.

11:18.169 --> 11:19.999
You get a much better
orienting that way.

11:20.024 --> 11:21.814
Yeah, I can see that.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.169
Hi, Mr. Frond.

11:23.194 --> 11:24.354
This is Don.

11:24.444 --> 11:26.114
He is joining our counseling department,

11:26.139 --> 11:28.589
and that's all I'm gonna
say about that for now.

11:28.614 --> 11:30.614
Finally, some help around here.

11:30.639 --> 11:32.430
I've been begging
Principal Spoors for months.

11:32.454 --> 11:34.021
Yo-boy.

11:34.046 --> 11:36.044
Okay, I'm gonna have to
orient you quickly, Don,

11:36.124 --> 11:38.204
because I'm dealing with a
bit of an emergency today.

11:38.244 --> 11:39.954
Any questions before we get started?

11:40.084 --> 11:42.254
Yes. Should I be paying attention,

11:42.294 --> 11:44.174
or is it enough if I
nod every now and then

11:44.254 --> 11:45.334
like I'm getting it?

11:45.384 --> 11:47.504
- Um, pay attention?
- Mm-hmm.

11:47.594 --> 11:51.014
Look at him. Mr. Frond
has no idea what's going on.

11:51.094 --> 11:52.804
He's orienting his own executioner.

11:52.884 --> 11:54.634
Like the old Domino's Pizza crust

11:54.684 --> 11:57.344
teaching the new Domino's
Pizza crust how to be crusty.

11:57.369 --> 11:59.079
So now's our chance to bust

11:59.104 --> 12:01.564
the Cabinet of Confiscation wide open.

12:01.589 --> 12:05.009
Forget combinations. We
need overwhelming force.

12:05.154 --> 12:08.684
Ah, Mr. Branca. Do you have
a crowbar we could borrow?

12:08.709 --> 12:11.129
A personal crowbar or a work crowbar?

12:11.154 --> 12:13.864
Beware, my personal crowbar is haunted.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.494
Okay, your work crowbar, then.

12:15.574 --> 12:17.204
Oh, I got that one downstairs.

12:17.229 --> 12:19.059
- Can we go get it?
- No, it's here.

12:19.084 --> 12:21.414
"Downstairs" is what I call my pants.

12:21.649 --> 12:22.979
Crap!

12:23.004 --> 12:24.784
Stupid! No, no!

12:24.809 --> 12:26.979
Can I interest you in
the Burger of the Day?

12:27.004 --> 12:28.190
- Oh, double crap!
- It's...  fries.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.424
Wait! I did it!

12:29.554 --> 12:31.314
Lin! I figured it out! Come see!

12:31.344 --> 12:32.844
- Oh, thank God.
- Yay, Bobby!

12:32.974 --> 12:34.394
It's just a little bit different.

12:34.514 --> 12:36.684
I slide the spatula under
the burger like normal.

12:36.764 --> 12:38.054
Sure, right.

12:38.184 --> 12:40.054
Then I bring in the second spatula.

12:40.144 --> 12:41.434
Second spatula?

12:41.459 --> 12:43.879
And I kind of push it
from one to the other.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.064
Then I rest for a sec. Whew.

12:46.209 --> 12:49.129
Then I turn the handle
of both spatulas...

12:49.154 --> 12:52.644
Delicate...  Ta-da!
Well? What do you think?

12:52.669 --> 12:55.129
It makes me feel...  sorry for you?

12:55.154 --> 12:57.074
It's kind of the burger-man equivalent

12:57.099 --> 12:58.969
of walking the ball back
to the pitcher, right?

12:59.124 --> 13:00.874
-You think I don't know that, Teddy?!
-Aah!

13:00.954 --> 13:02.494
Something's wrong with my brain!

13:02.519 --> 13:05.269
It's a very simple task,
and I'm not even close.

13:05.294 --> 13:07.424
I'm broken! And you did this!

13:07.504 --> 13:09.214
You did this, Teddy!

13:09.239 --> 13:10.829
Bob, Bob, Bob, hey.

13:10.854 --> 13:13.774
- Easy. Come here.
- Oh! Hold me!

13:13.844 --> 13:16.384
There, there. There he is. Ow! Ow!

13:16.514 --> 13:17.974
Easy with those spatulas!

13:18.054 --> 13:20.094
It's slow, but I think
we're getting there.

13:20.144 --> 13:22.104
That's the name of my one-man show.

13:22.184 --> 13:24.974
So how about I take all
the truly messed-up kids

13:25.104 --> 13:26.984
and you tackle Peter Pescadero?

13:27.104 --> 13:28.944
He's got a weird belly button,

13:28.984 --> 13:31.064
and about every three
weeks or so, a kid sees it.

13:31.089 --> 13:32.420
I don't know. My belly button's perfect,

13:32.444 --> 13:34.074
and he might sense that.

13:34.154 --> 13:36.904
Ms. Schnur will take your
picture for your I.D. card.

13:36.929 --> 13:38.889
And that completes your orientation.

13:38.914 --> 13:40.619
Oy. So, Mr. Frond...

13:40.644 --> 13:42.179
What's that?

13:42.204 --> 13:45.204
Louise! The Cabinet of Confiscation!

13:45.254 --> 13:48.094
- Mr. Branca's work crowbar!
- Did you do it?

13:48.119 --> 13:50.268
Not yet. I was just in my windup.

13:50.293 --> 13:53.004
- Do what?
- Aw, you poor, poor man.

13:53.094 --> 13:54.754
Poor me? Poor you!

13:54.844 --> 13:56.124
All right, I'm just gonna say it.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.804
Don is here to replace you.

13:57.884 --> 14:00.134
Nice try. Don is completely unqualified.

14:00.224 --> 14:02.014
That's not what my mom says.

14:02.144 --> 14:03.894
Damn it, I meant to say "your mom."

14:03.974 --> 14:06.414
Mr. Frond, Ms. Schnur's gonna
ask you to take a walk with her.

14:06.484 --> 14:07.581
No, she's not.

14:07.606 --> 14:09.379
Let's take a little walk, Mr. Frond.

14:09.404 --> 14:10.954
Seriously?

14:11.064 --> 14:13.484
That's how I feel any time
I have to walk anywhere.

14:13.614 --> 14:16.034
- But I love my job.
- Ew.

14:16.114 --> 14:17.364
Fine.

14:17.404 --> 14:20.114
Make sure Eli gets his placebo Ritalin.

14:20.244 --> 14:21.704
It's, uh, a raisin.

14:21.744 --> 14:23.374
If Jessica gets ragey before lunch,

14:23.454 --> 14:26.204
it's just low blood
sugar. Give her a raisin.

14:26.294 --> 14:27.874
Mr. Frond will be okay, right?

14:27.964 --> 14:30.014
He could probably do with some time off.

14:30.044 --> 14:31.874
And Don, he's gonna
work out great for us

14:31.964 --> 14:33.044
as a guidance counselor.

14:33.174 --> 14:34.884
He's dumb, and he doesn't give a crap.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.344
Unlike Mr. Phillip
"Cares Too Much" Frond.

14:37.464 --> 14:39.014
I've never heard his full name.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.054
- It's pretty.
- He's always busting his butt,

14:41.184 --> 14:43.514
doing his best to actually counsel kids,

14:43.604 --> 14:46.114
the big, dopey son of a...

14:46.144 --> 14:49.234
I don't feel as great 
about this as I want to.

14:49.314 --> 14:50.984
Whew. I'm glad to hear you say that.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.345
It's kind of what I was feeling,
but you're the principal,

14:53.404 --> 14:55.004
and I guess I'm
intimidated by authority.

14:55.114 --> 14:57.441
I was totally on the same page, too.

14:57.466 --> 14:59.014
Uh, glad you both finally came around.

14:59.039 --> 15:01.089
Huh, something's written
on a piece of tape

15:01.114 --> 15:02.164
on the back of this lock.

15:02.204 --> 15:03.874
"One, one, one, one."

15:03.899 --> 15:06.519
He wrote the combination
on the back of the lock?

15:06.544 --> 15:08.094
And we never turned the lock over?

15:08.119 --> 15:10.443
And he couldn't remember
"one, one, one, one"?

15:13.429 --> 15:16.107
It's everything we ever dreamed of.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.134
- Whoopee cushions.
- Cans of Jolt.

15:18.214 --> 15:20.674
Rubber snake. Oh, no,
that's a dead real one.

15:20.804 --> 15:22.434
Guys, listen.

15:22.459 --> 15:25.029
We can either have the
best afternoon of our lives

15:25.054 --> 15:27.814
playing with this stuff,
or we can save Frond's job

15:27.854 --> 15:30.144
while I'm still principal.
There's not time to do both.

15:30.234 --> 15:31.994
Can I at least make the dead snake

15:32.064 --> 15:34.040
- sit on the whoopee cushion?
- All right, real quick.

15:34.064 --> 15:36.341
Okay, let's go.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.576
Principal Spoors
comes back tomorrow.

15:41.601 --> 15:44.787
So we've only got to the end
of the day to make Don gone.

15:44.812 --> 15:46.716
It's almost 2:00.
There's no time to waste.

15:46.748 --> 15:49.254
Wait. Wasting time.
That gives me an idea.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.983
What's the biggest time
waster of all at school?

15:52.008 --> 15:54.498
That thing I do where I take
all my pencils to the bathroom

15:54.523 --> 15:55.943
and give them each a little bath?

15:55.968 --> 15:57.468
No, assemblies.

15:57.493 --> 16:00.535
As principal, I'll
call a special assembly

16:00.560 --> 16:02.863
to give Frond a fond farewell.

16:02.888 --> 16:04.768
A Frond-well, for short.

16:04.793 --> 16:06.453
And to welcome the
new guidance counselor.

16:06.478 --> 16:08.548
Oh, my God, that sounds like...

16:08.573 --> 16:10.913
just a super thoughtful thing to do?

16:10.938 --> 16:12.778
It won't be thoughtful.

16:12.923 --> 16:14.963
But it will be super.

16:14.988 --> 16:18.108
Okay, sounding more ominous
now, the way you said it.

16:18.198 --> 16:21.144
Bob, Linda! I think I got it!

16:21.169 --> 16:23.223
- What? What, Teddy?
- All Bob can think of

16:23.248 --> 16:25.068
is how he's gonna mess up the burger.

16:25.093 --> 16:28.262
So he does! He needs something
else to fill his brain.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.537
Like that baseball
movie with Kevin Costner.

16:30.562 --> 16:32.562
- Oh, yeah, Bill Durham.
- Bull.

16:32.587 --> 16:34.757
Don't say that till
you hear the idea, Bob.

16:34.797 --> 16:37.047
No. The mo...  the char...  Forget it.

16:37.072 --> 16:39.312
So, not Bill Durham, but
the other guy, the pitcher,

16:39.337 --> 16:40.537
was crazy wild.

16:40.562 --> 16:41.982
So to take his mind off it,

16:42.007 --> 16:43.153
that lady gave him her underwear.

16:43.177 --> 16:44.837
Bob's not wearing my underwear.

16:44.862 --> 16:46.862
I got them stretched out
just the way I like them.

16:46.887 --> 16:49.231
No, no. You don't have
to wear Linda's underwear.

16:49.256 --> 16:51.388
-Okay.
-I'm talking about Jimmy's Pesto's.

16:51.435 --> 16:53.904
Oh, my God. Wait. How did you get those?

16:53.912 --> 16:55.672
I bribed his bartender
Trev to sneak them out

16:55.742 --> 16:57.122
of Jimmy's gym bag.

16:57.147 --> 16:59.607
Now I got to build Trev a
pretty intricate doghouse.

16:59.632 --> 17:01.058
Well, I'm not wearing those, either.

17:01.082 --> 17:02.542
Bob, you gotta try.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.487
Put that Pesto in your
pants. It's our only hope.

17:04.737 --> 17:06.357
Are they clean?

17:08.107 --> 17:09.357
They are not.

17:09.382 --> 17:11.932
Hi. Acting Principal Louise here.

17:13.821 --> 17:15.972
You're welcome. As you may have heard,

17:16.012 --> 17:18.852
Mr. Frond is leaving the
school he's been at forever.

17:18.877 --> 17:21.827
He's the pest in the vest
who's always distressed.

17:21.852 --> 17:23.982
He's Mr. Frond. A few words?

17:24.007 --> 17:27.717
Uh, I'm disappointed but undaunted.

17:27.821 --> 17:30.612
So, tomorrow, I get up, get dressed,

17:30.637 --> 17:33.277
blank space, blank
space, go to bed early.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.422
Oh, my God, I have no idea what to do.

17:35.492 --> 17:36.912
Except keep it from Mother.

17:36.992 --> 17:39.269
- Hot mic, Mr. F.!
- Huh? Oh, yes.

17:39.294 --> 17:41.212
I-I'm gonna go pack up my office.

17:41.292 --> 17:43.712
That zen garden isn't gonna travel well.

17:43.737 --> 17:45.817
Now let's meet our
new guidance counselor.

17:45.842 --> 17:48.302
Don. Where do you guys go to school?

17:48.342 --> 17:50.676
Oh. Here. Right.

17:50.701 --> 17:52.340
Jokes. Thank you. Good night.

17:52.365 --> 17:54.262
Don, since you're up
here, maybe you could take

17:54.342 --> 17:55.942
a few counseling
questions from students?

17:56.052 --> 17:58.002
Oh, I don't think anybody
wants to, uh, hear...

17:58.027 --> 17:59.907
- We got one here, Don.
- Okay.

17:59.932 --> 18:02.482
My hamster got killed by our Roomba,

18:02.507 --> 18:04.394
and I'm having trouble moving on.

18:04.419 --> 18:07.022
Young girl's first
experience with death. Don?

18:07.047 --> 18:09.507
Uh...  I'll have to come
back to that, I think.

18:09.612 --> 18:12.151
Young man here has a
question about puberty.

18:12.176 --> 18:14.677
Ever since I started
getting hair on my...

18:14.702 --> 18:16.468
You know what? Let's go back
to the, uh, hamster girl.

18:16.492 --> 18:17.678
I have one over here, Don.

18:17.702 --> 18:19.162
A friend of mine is asthmatic,

18:19.187 --> 18:20.977
and his parents are divorced.

18:21.002 --> 18:23.292
He's wondering if maybe
it's the asthma's fault?

18:23.437 --> 18:25.147
- Uh...  yeah, maybe.
- What?

18:25.172 --> 18:28.112
My brothers are twins,
but there's only one of me,

18:28.137 --> 18:30.857
and it feels like a rip-off.
Where's my twin, Don?

18:30.882 --> 18:32.012
Where's my twin?

18:32.092 --> 18:33.842
I'm right here, Jay-Ju. I got you.

18:33.882 --> 18:35.432
You don't look like me!

18:35.512 --> 18:37.392
Not a criteria for friendship. I get it.

18:37.432 --> 18:39.432
Can I...  can I get a glass
of some water, please?

18:39.562 --> 18:41.932
We're a school, not a
five-star restaurant, Don.

18:41.982 --> 18:45.092
He was lying there
with his little legs in the air.

18:45.117 --> 18:47.247
Just like when I found Grandpa.

18:47.272 --> 18:50.692
Why does everything die?

18:50.717 --> 18:53.722
You know, I think...  mic...  cut out...

18:53.747 --> 18:55.547
Uh, no. Mic's working fine for me.

18:55.572 --> 18:57.662
All right, Don, answer the questions.

18:57.687 --> 19:00.715
How's banana hands doing? Zoom!

19:00.792 --> 19:03.362
Show's over, Jimmy. Bob got yip therapy.

19:03.387 --> 19:05.057
Yeah, right.

19:05.082 --> 19:06.712
No, Jimmy, I'm back.

19:06.752 --> 19:08.082
Square in the middle of the grill.

19:08.107 --> 19:09.777
- That's my Bobby.
- Fluke.

19:09.802 --> 19:12.262
Fluke you, Jimmy. Bob's all better.

19:12.287 --> 19:14.947
- And it's thanks to you, pal.
- Thanks to me.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.122
You helped me in a very intimate way.

19:17.147 --> 19:18.737
Don't say "intimate." Come on.

19:18.762 --> 19:20.012
You eating? It's on me.

19:20.037 --> 19:21.747
The burgers are on me.

19:21.772 --> 19:23.578
I'm not talking about
something else being on me.

19:23.602 --> 19:24.812
But I...  could.

19:24.892 --> 19:26.062
You know, you're being weird.

19:26.142 --> 19:28.062
If I wanted weird, I'd listen to Trev

19:28.087 --> 19:30.127
talk about some crazy
doghouse he's getting.

19:30.152 --> 19:33.007
I've enjoyed our brief time, Jimmy.

19:33.032 --> 19:35.192
Go back to underwear you came from.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.062
Stop saying things I-I don't get.

19:37.087 --> 19:39.479
I'm leaving. Have fun
with your stupid words.

19:39.504 --> 19:40.492
Bye.

19:40.582 --> 19:42.702
Hey, Bob. Any way I could
get a turn in those things?

19:42.832 --> 19:43.978
I got to fix a roof tomorrow.

19:44.002 --> 19:45.662
I could use any help I could get.

19:45.792 --> 19:48.082
- Mmm...
- Aw, Bob, let Teddy wear 'em.

19:48.107 --> 19:49.397
He's gonna do a roof.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.842
All right. But I want them back.

19:51.882 --> 19:52.938
- You're the one who copies me.
- You copy me, Jocelyn.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.737
Sorry. Who had brown
hair until she met me

19:54.762 --> 19:56.408
-and now she's blonde?
-I'd have to look at you to copy you.

19:56.432 --> 19:58.278
-I don't even like to look at you. Whatever.
-Whatever.

19:58.302 --> 20:00.012
Best friends in crisis. Don?

20:00.052 --> 20:03.566
I...  I left...  an ice
cream cake in my trunk.

20:04.707 --> 20:06.522
All right. It's not a friend.

20:06.602 --> 20:08.232
It's me.

20:08.272 --> 20:11.272
Good assembly. Did Peter
Pescadero confess to a crime?

20:11.297 --> 20:13.651
Ah. Don just quit.

20:13.676 --> 20:15.087
Says a tree fell on him.

20:15.112 --> 20:16.956
- Aw.
- Great, great.

20:16.981 --> 20:18.232
Now let's find Mr. Frond.

20:18.257 --> 20:20.297
He left the assembly early. Come on.

20:20.322 --> 20:23.401
- Mr. Frond, stop.
- Not now, Louise.

20:23.426 --> 20:25.832
I just want to go home and
get in the bath with my cats.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.437
We've got a major situation.

20:27.462 --> 20:29.767
- Don quit.
- What? He did?

20:29.792 --> 20:31.992
So the school needs
a guidance counselor.

20:32.017 --> 20:34.331
I'm only gonna be principal
for three more minutes.

20:34.356 --> 20:36.857
I want the last thing I
do to be hiring you back.

20:36.882 --> 20:39.382
You have no authority to
offer me a job, Louise.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.515
- Hmm, in that case...
- I accept. Thank God.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.827
Good negotiation.

20:42.852 --> 20:44.908
Maybe you should've asked
for a better parking place?

20:44.932 --> 20:46.892
Come on. Let's move you
back into your office.

20:46.981 --> 20:49.037
It's a good thing you didn't
grab all your stuff yet.

20:49.070 --> 20:51.200
- This is all my stuff.
- Oh.

20:51.272 --> 20:53.152
You know, Louise, as a principal today,

20:53.177 --> 20:55.398
you were actually pretty good.

20:55.423 --> 20:56.717
Thanks, Mr. Frond.

20:56.742 --> 20:58.702
You're pretty good. For noticing that.

20:58.821 --> 21:01.007
Whoops! It's fine. Don't look.
