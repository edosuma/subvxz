00:03.420 --> 00:04.754
OH, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

00:04.879 --> 00:06.297
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:06.339 --> 00:10.343
ALL THIS TIME, ACCUSING ME!
I AM NOT COMING HOME TONIGHT.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.429
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CALL ME
YESTERDAY.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.264
I FELL ASLEEP THE MINUTE
I GOT HOME.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.558
EVERYTHING NORMAL?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.477

00:47.589 --> 00:49.758

00:50.216 --> 00:52.177
NO FORCED ENTRY.
BACK ROOM'S RANSACKED.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.261

00:53.470 --> 00:55.555

FOUND THE DOOR OPEN.

YOU TALK TO HIM?

00:56.765 --> 00:57.766
NO, I JUST GOT HERE.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.226
JONES, MEDAVOY, AND ORTIZ
ARE DOING A CANVASS.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.854
DOBBS, COME ON.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.233

01:14.199 --> 01:16.534
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHEN'D YOU FIND HIM?

01:16.785 --> 01:19.746
I FOUND THE DOOR OPEN AROUND
3:00 JUST AFTER CLOCKING IN

01:19.829 --> 01:21.289
AT THE CHECKPOINT AROUND
THE CORNER.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.707
I COULD TELL YOU EXACTLY.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.334
THE DOC GENERALLY HERE
THIS LATE?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.669
I'M ONLY WORKING HERE
THREE WEEKS.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.963
YOU SEE ANYBODY LAST NIGHT
THAT DIDN'T BELONG?

01:29.130 --> 01:31.132
AROUND 1:30,
DOING MY ROUNDS.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.803
I SAW THIS TALL WHITE GUY
SORT OF HANGING OUT BY
THE ALLEY NEXT DOOR.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.471
SORT OF HALF IN, HALF OUT.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.514
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

01:37.806 --> 01:40.600
NO, BUT HE WAS GONE WHEN
I CAME AROUND AGAIN AT 2:00.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.353
YOU DON'T TALK TO SUSPICIOUS
PEOPLE HANGING AROUND ALLEYWAYS?

01:43.770 --> 01:44.813
I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS A JUNKIE.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.022
DID YOU HEAR SHOTS?

01:46.189 --> 01:48.983
NO, BUT WHOEVER DID THIS COULD
HAVE USED A SILENCER.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.114
YOUR LITTLE SECURITY OFFICE
GOT A TV?

01:54.405 --> 01:55.031
YEAH.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.867
GOT A LITTLE SPACE HEATER, TOO?
KEEPS THE PLACE COZY?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.869
I MIGHT HAVE RESTED MY EYES
FOR A MINUTE.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.746
YEAH, RIGHT.
THANKS.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.249
WHAT,
DID HE KICK YOUR DOG?

02:04.624 --> 02:05.625
YOU GOT SOMETHING?

02:05.708 --> 02:07.252

ARE YOU OKAY?

02:22.058 --> 02:23.101
I'M FINE.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.145
DID I DO SOMETHING LAST NIGHT
THAT MADE YOU ANGRY?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.980
NO. IT WAS A FUN TIME.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.026
THE LITTLE KISS--DID IT MAKE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE?

02:32.068 --> 02:32.944
NO, IT WAS FINE.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.823
WE SHOULD LOOK FOR A WAY TO GET
TO THE D.O.A.'s FAMILY.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.651

YEAR'S CASES,

03:54.734 --> 03:58.488

04:02.367 --> 04:04.369
AND I RECOMMEND WAITING UNTIL
THERE'S A PILE

04:04.452 --> 04:06.412
RATHER THAN RUNNING OFF THE
MINUTE SOMETHING COMES IN.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.457
JOHN, I KNOW HOW TO FILE.
MONKEYS CAN FILE.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.752
THE COMPUTER IS FOR...

04:12.877 --> 04:14.921

I CLEARED IT WITH THE BOROUGH.

04:16.756 --> 04:19.342
YEAH, YEAH, I AM.
I WRITE MOVIES.

04:19.592 --> 04:21.219

ANYTHING

SPELLING.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.908

04:43.992 --> 04:46.035
NO, NO OTHER TENANTS WERE IN
THERE LATE.

ANGELA STOKES?

04:49.789 --> 04:51.082
A TON OF PROSS COLLARS.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.209
VICE HAS A LOCATION TO LOOK
FOR HER.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.337
WE GOT NARCOTICS SWEEPING THE
AREA AROUND THE BUILDING.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.340
THERE'S A METHADONE CLINIC A
BLOCK DOWN WHERE JUNKIES BUY.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.341
MAYBE ONE OF THEM SAW
SOMETHING.

05:00.717 --> 05:01.801

LINE ONE.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.220
WE PAWED THROUGH THE D.O.A.'s
RECORDS

05:04.262 --> 05:06.222
AND FOUND A SECOND OFFICE
IN CHELSEA.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.683
HE WORKED WITH A PARTNER --
RAYMOND CHAMBERS.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.767

TERIK EL RAHIM.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.807
A HOMELESS GUY CALLED IT IN FROM
THE CORNER BODEGA.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.683
WHO'S THIS?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.852
THE D.O.A.'s GIRLFRIEND,
A NATALIE INNISS.

05:52.852 --> 05:53.895
HOW'D SHE GET HIP?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.146
OFF THE D.O.A.'s I.D.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.523

NOTIFICATION.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.858
HOW LONG YOU BEEN ON THE

06:16.584 --> 06:18.753
VERY SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
IS THIS YOUR BOYFRIEND?

06:18.753 --> 06:19.670
YES.

THIS MORNING.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.554
WHERE WAS HE OFF TO?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.139
MA'AM? MA'AM?

06:30.139 --> 06:31.933
MA'AM, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
COME ON. COME ON.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.685
I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT THIS IS A CRIME SCENE,

06:34.685 --> 06:36.604
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WANT US TO
CATCH WHOEVER DID THIS,

06:36.604 --> 06:37.939
YOU GOTTA LEAVE
THE SCENE ALONE.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.399
YOU CAN HOLD HIS HAND
ALL YOU WANT

06:39.399 --> 06:41.275
AFTER THE CRIME SCENE'S
DONE.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.527
COME ON. TAKE HER.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.655
[ CRYING ]

06:50.827 --> 06:52.620
COME ON IN, DR. CHAMBERS.
HAVE A SEAT.

06:53.746 --> 06:54.789
BEFORE WE SAY ANYTHING,

06:54.872 --> 06:57.083
I NEED YOU TO KNOW HOW
DEVASTATING THIS IS,

06:57.250 --> 06:59.419
AND NOT JUST TO ME
AND DR. LU'S FAMILY,

06:59.502 --> 07:01.295
BUT TO HIS WHOLE COMMUNITY
OF PATIENTS.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.338
OF COURSE.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.715
WERE YOU AND DR. LU
PARTNERS LONG?

07:04.882 --> 07:07.009
SEVEN YEARS.
HE PICKED ME UP
OUT OF COLUMBIA

07:07.385 --> 07:09.387
DOES HE HAVE ANY ENEMIES
YOU KNOW OF?
NONE.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.431
WAS HE FAITHFUL TO HIS
WIFE?

07:11.556 --> 07:12.849
RELIGIOUSLY DEVOTED.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.225
HOW WAS BUSINESS?

07:14.308 --> 07:15.893
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

07:15.893 --> 07:18.563
WE'VE BEEN BILLING $80,000 TO
$100,000 A MONTH, SO THRIVING,

07:19.063 --> 07:20.982
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT MOTIVATED
DR. LU.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.775
HE WAS COMMUNITY-ORIENTED.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.361
HENCE THE CHARITY CLINIC.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.613
AND THAT'S WHERE WE FOUND HIM,
THE CHARITY CLINIC?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.198
HE WORKED THERE
ONE DAY A WEEK,

07:29.407 --> 07:31.742
ALL FREE,
ALL ON HIS OWN TIME.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.495
HE GAVE EVERY OUNCE OF HIMSELF
FOR NOTHING,

07:34.787 --> 07:36.664
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THAT'S WHAT
GOT HIM KILLED.

07:36.747 --> 07:37.665
HOW SO?

07:37.707 --> 07:41.711
HE TREATED SCUM DOWN THERE --
WHORES, JUNKIES, CRACK HEADS.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.505
THEY WOULD STEAL FROM HIM.
THEY'D GET ABUSIVE.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.715
ANYONE SPECIFIC?

07:46.257 --> 07:47.633
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.303
DID THE DOCTOR EVER MENTION AN
ANGELA STOKES?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.472
WE FOUND HER NAME ON A
PRESCRIPTION SHEET.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.267
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF HER, AND
IT'S PROBABLY NOT HER REAL NAME.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.478
SO WHEN YOU SAY YOU THINK IT WAS
ONE OF HIS PATIENTS,

07:58.978 --> 08:01.772
THAT'S LESS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF
A THREAT AND MORE SPECULATION.

08:01.814 --> 08:05.318
WHICH I BASE ON HAVING ROTATED
THROUGH PLENTY OF COUNTY E.R.s,

08:05.401 --> 08:07.778
WHERE I TREATED ENOUGH SHOOTERS,
ABSCESSES,

08:07.862 --> 08:11.115
AND O.D.s AND CRACK BABIES TO
KNOW THAT THOSE PEOPLE --

08:11.699 --> 08:13.451
RACE NONSPECIFIC --

08:13.493 --> 08:15.828
PLACE ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE ON
HUMAN LIFE,

08:15.870 --> 08:16.996
THEIR OWN OR OTHERS'.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.081
I TAKE IT YOU DIDN'T
PUT IN A LOT OF TIME

08:19.123 --> 08:20.333
AT DR. LU'S FREE CLINIC.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.585
I ADMIRED HIM FOR HIS EFFORTS,
BUT NO.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.129
I DID MY TIME DEALING
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.759
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:30.051 --> 08:30.885
WE'RE DONE.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.888
I PROMISED ALBERT'S WIFE I'D
SERVE AS LIAISON,

08:33.930 --> 08:35.306
SO WHEN THERE'S DEVELOPMENTS,

08:35.306 --> 08:37.099
I NEED TO BE CONTACTED
IMMEDIATELY.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.063
PRICK.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.235
OH, HEY, JOHN WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU

08:47.318 --> 08:49.237
THAT VICE FOUND
ANGELA STOKES.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.112
THEY'RE BRINGING HER IN.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.366
CAN I GET SOME MUD?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.784
HELP YOURSELF.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.371
SO I OVERHEARD YOU'RE A
SCREENWRITER.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.081
YEP.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.874
ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE SEEN?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.167
NO, NOT YET.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.669
SO WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO
WRITE ABOUT?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.337
WHAT'S YOUR GENRE?

09:06.546 --> 09:10.216
I DON'T PIGEONHOLE MYSELF, BUT I
LIKE SCI-FI, THRILLERS.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.511
I WAS WORKING ON THIS
FISH-OUT-OF-WATER
ROMANTIC COMEDY, BUT...

09:13.719 --> 09:15.054
STALLED ON ME.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.014
NOW I'M HEADING INTO MORE
REALITY-BASED SUBJECT MATTER.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.100
LIKE POLICE WORK?

09:20.184 --> 09:21.227
IT CROSSED MY MIND.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.231
I'VE GOT ABOUT A MILLION STORIES
AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID

09:25.314 --> 09:28.442
THAT IN THE RIGHT HANDS, THEY'D
MAKE A GREAT FEATURE FILM.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.653
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
THEIR LIVES WOULD MAKE
A GOOD MOVIE.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.780
99% OF THEM ARE WRONG.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.366
HEY, THIS IS
THE 1% HERE, PAL.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.623
BUT SINCE YOU ARE LOOKING INTO
REALITY-BASED SUBJECT MATTER,

09:42.707 --> 09:44.667
MAYBE I COULD TELL YOU SOME
OF MY STORIES,

09:44.917 --> 09:46.669
PITCH THEM TO YOU,
SEE WHAT YOU THINK.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.920
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.094
SHOCKING AS IT MAY SEEM, I<i> HAVE</i>
LED AN INTERESTING LIFE.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.430
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.307
OKAY, THANKS.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.104
TERIK EL RAHIM OWED TWO YEARS
PAROLE ON A ROBBERY-HOMICIDE

10:05.104 --> 10:06.147
FROM 20 YEARS AGO.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.690
BACK THEN, HE WAS
MARVIN WINTERS.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.816
MARVIN WINTERS?

10:09.108 --> 10:11.485
A MARKET ON BOWERY, RIGHT?
HE BEAT THE OWNER WITH A PIPE?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.822
THAT WAS ONE OF THE WORST
BEATINGS I EVER SEEN.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.617
AND THAT WAS JUST A ROBBERY?
NO GRUDGE?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.369
HIM AND A PARTNER WENT IN ALL
DOPED UP.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.621
WINTERS JUST LOST IT.

10:21.954 --> 10:22.997
GUESS IT CAME BACK TO HIM.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.916
HIS P.O. IS LANCE EDMUNDS.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.502
HE SAYS HE'LL KEEP HIMSELF
AVAILABLE ALL DAY.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.463
VICE IS ON THEIR WAY WITH
ANGELA STOKES.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.214
RITA, CONNIE,
YOU TWO TALK TO HER?

10:33.132 --> 10:34.091
YOU GOT IT.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.355
YOU KNOW THIS IS A LOT OF
ATTENTION

10:47.355 --> 10:48.648
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF DOPE.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.024
AND HOOKING.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.442
I GOTTA EAT!

10:52.234 --> 10:54.153
WHERE WERE YOU EARLY THIS
MORNING, ANGELA?

10:54.236 --> 10:54.945
WORKING.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.530
ON WHO?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.115
WHAT'S UP?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.784
ACCOUNT FOR YOUR TIME LAST
NIGHT, ANGELA.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.661
WITH A LOT OF JOHNS I
DIDN'T KNOW

11:01.744 --> 11:03.162
AND DIDN'T ASK FOR I.D.,
WHY?

11:03.412 --> 11:04.789
YOU KNOW DR. ALBERT LU?

11:05.414 --> 11:06.832
HE'S MY DOCTOR.
FOR WHAT?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.250
ISN'T THAT BETWEEN HIM
AND ME?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.710
ISN'T THERE A LAW ABOUT THAT?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.629
IT TAKES A BACK SEAT TO SOLVING
A HOMICIDE.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.005
WHAT HOMICIDE?

11:16.050 --> 11:19.887
YOU'RE SAYING DR. LU --
DR. LU'S DEAD?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.222
WHAT'D YOU SEE HIM FOR?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.598
FOR, YOU KNOW, THINGS.
HEALTH.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.309
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
HE'S DEAD?

11:25.393 --> 11:26.644
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

11:26.769 --> 11:27.895
A WHILE AGO.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.730
YOU TALK TO HIM RECENTLY?
NO.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.525
HOW COME WE FOUND HIM WITH A
PRESCRIPTION IN HIS POCKET

11:32.608 --> 11:33.901
MADE OUT TO YOU DATED TODAY?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.028
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO GET OFF
YOUR CHEST?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.489
I CALLED HIM ABOUT SOME
BACK PAIN.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.490
HE WROTE ME A SCRIPT

11:39.490 --> 11:40.783
WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.952
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME AN
EXAMINATION, BUT HE DIDN'T.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.662
GAVE IT TO ME ANYWAY.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.706
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK HE
WAS DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.999
BEING SO PROTECTIVE, YOU MUST
HAVE BEEN CLOSE.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.543
HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.712
ANYONE YOU CAN THINK OF WHO
MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT DIFFERENT?

11:52.878 --> 11:53.754
NO.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.048
ALL HE DID WAS HELP PEOPLE.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.759
NEVER ASKED FOR MONEY,
NEVER ASKED ANY QUESTIONS.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.053
LIKE, "DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
BACK PAIN, OR DO YOU JUST
HAVE A HABIT?"

12:01.095 --> 12:04.098
EXCUSE ME, BUT 15 YEARS OF
GETTING TWISTED AROUND IN CARS

12:04.140 --> 12:06.142
AND DOING GUYS UP
AGAINST WALLS TAKES A TOLL.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.351
I BET.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.395
NOT TO MENTION GETTING BEAT
ABOUT 60 TIMES.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.356
DID ME A FAVOR
'CAUSE HE WAS A GOOD GUY.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.608
COME ON, ANGELA, YOU'RE GOING IN
FOR THE POSSESSION.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.738
WE'LL TALK TO THE D.A., SEE IF
WE CAN GET YOU SOME PLAY.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.823
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU'RE GOING
DOWNSTAIRS TO A CELL.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.783
GREAT.
PERFECT DAY.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.087
TERIK WAS THE MOST IDEAL PAROLEE
I'VE DEALT WITH.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.382
THAT'S OKAY, YOU CAN CALL HIM
MARVIN IN FRONT OF US.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.968
THIS ISN'T A GUY WHO TOOK THE
MUSLIM NAME BECAUSE IT WAS COOL.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.470
HE WAS BEHIND THE PROGRAM.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.555
LIKE WHAT, HE STOPPED EATING
PORK?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.348
IN THE YEAR AND HALF
HE'S BEEN OUT,

12:46.348 --> 12:48.476
HE'S STARTED UP A
COMMUNITY-ACTIVIST ORGANIZATION

12:48.476 --> 12:49.977
CALLED LIFE SEEDS--
LIFE SEEDS.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.021
WHICH IS
FUNDED BY DONATIONS

12:52.271 --> 12:54.231
HE WENT OUT AND GOT
FROM MAJOR CORPORATIONS.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.150
SO HE WAS A SHAKEDOWN
ARTIST.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.151
NO, HE WASN'T.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.487
EVERY DIME OF THAT MONEY WENT TO
COMMUNITY SERVICES.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.738
YOU SAW THE BOOKS?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.448
CONN'S COMMUNITY CENTER?

13:02.990 --> 13:04.950
THAT WAS RENOVATED WITH MONEY
TERIK RAISED.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.994
PABLO ESCOBAR BUILT SOCCER
FIELDS

13:07.036 --> 13:09.663
WHEN HE WASN'T MOVING TONS OF
COKE AND WHACKING JUDGES.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.831
WHO WERE HIS ASSOCIATES?

13:11.415 --> 13:12.833
LOTS OF PEOPLE.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.044
HE WAS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY
RAISING MONEY,
SPEAKING IN SCHOOLS.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.713
WHO WAS CLOSE TO HIM BESIDES
HIS GIRLFRIEND, NATALIE?

13:17.838 --> 13:19.256
HE HAD A BUDDY
ERIC GREEN.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.801
ERIC GREEN, WHO WAS IN ON
ROBBING

13:21.801 --> 13:24.595
AND BEATING THAT OLD MAN TO
DEATH 20 YEARS AGO.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.639
YEAH, ERIC DID 15 YEARS.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.391
THEY HOOKED BACK UP AFTER TERIK
GOT OUT, BUT THEY'RE BOTH CLEAN.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.852
ERIC WORKS FOR TERIK AT
LIFE SEEDS.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.729
TERIK WATCHES OUT FOR HIM.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.189
WATCHED OUT FOR HIM.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.358
TERIK HAVE ANY PROBLEMS

13:37.858 --> 13:39.860
FIRST TWO YEARS,

13:40.152 --> 13:42.154
NOTHING THE LAST 16 YEARS --

13:42.238 --> 13:44.782
MODEL PRISONER, MADE THE BOARD

13:45.074 --> 13:48.828
LET'S GO TALK TO HIS SCUMBAG
ACCOMPLICE, ERIC GREEN.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.164
HEY. WE KNOW WHAT TERIK DID.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.125
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY
WAS OUT THERE TRYING TO
MAKE A DIFFERENCE

13:55.209 --> 13:56.460
WITH THE SECOND CHANCE HE GOT.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.671

14:04.927 --> 14:06.011
HAVE A SEAT, ERIC.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.392

FRIEND TERIK.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.311
YEAH, I HEARD.
HIS GIRLFRIEND TOLD ME.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.813
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.022
I DON'T KNOW WHO DID HIM.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.566
HE SCREW ANYBODY OVER?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.443
NO, TERIK KEPT HIS NOSE CLEAN
SINCE HE GOT OUT.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.573
HE KEEP WOMEN ON THE SIDE, ONE
OF THEM GET PISSED OFF, MAYBE?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.033
NO,
HIM AND NATALIE WERE SOLID.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.494
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU, TERIK WAS
STRAIGHT-UP MUSLIM.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.912
HE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND,
RIGHT?

14:32.413 --> 14:35.124
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO HELP US FIND WHO KILLED HIM?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.877
YOU GONNA FIND
THIS OUT ANYWAY. BUT...

14:38.544 --> 14:41.088
LAST WEEK,
HE HAD TO FIRE THIS KID

14:41.088 --> 14:43.674
WHO WAS WORKING OVER AT HIS
COMMUNITY DEAL, LIFE SEEDS.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.050
FOR WHAT?
TAKING MONEY.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.595
CASH DONATION CAME IN, KID
POCKETED IT.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.471
TERIK FIRED HIM

14:51.181 --> 14:53.726

15:13.662 --> 15:14.872

AROUND THAT PLACE.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.541
BEATS WORKING.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.211
OR DID YOU GET ALL
"REHABILITATED" TOO,

15:21.545 --> 15:25.174
IF TARIK WAS HERE, HE WOULD SAY
ASSALAMU ALALIKUM--

15:25.549 --> 15:28.594
GOD'S PEACE BE UPON YOU,
MY BROTHER.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.723
I DIDN'T KILL TERIK.
I WISH I KNEW WHO DID.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.683

15:34.767 --> 15:36.769
DON'T DEPUTIZE YOURSELF

18:15.761 --> 18:17.429
MUST HAVE PISSED YOU OFF,
GETTING FIRED.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.390

GOING ON.

PUMPED INTO HIM --

30:37.710 --> 30:39.546

ROBBERY."

FROM SOMETHING PRIOR.

YOU'LL GO DOWN AS A PSYCHO

WAS IT SOMETHING OF A SEXUAL

31:56.205 --> 31:57.457

WANTED ANOTHER GET-TOGETHER.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.547
SHE SAID YEAH,
SO I WENT BACK.

BE A ROBBERY.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.449
HEY, JOSH, WILL YOU GET HER
DOWNSTAIRS FOR ME?

40:11.700 --> 40:13.369

40:16.080 --> 40:17.415
I ASKED TO BE KEPT INFORMED.

40:17.456 --> 40:18.499
WE'VE BEEN BUSY

40:18.582 --> 40:20.292
THE ASIAN-AMERICAN PHYSICIANS
ASSOCIATION

40:20.292 --> 40:23.170
WANTS TO RUN AN IN-DEPTH
OBITUARY ON DR. LU.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.881
THEY WOULD LIKE SOME INFORMATION
ABOUT THE MURDER.

40:26.132 --> 40:29.468
THE WOMAN THAT WAS HERE, DOC --
THE PROSTITUTE -- WAS INVOLVED,

40:29.468 --> 40:31.512
AS WAS A 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO
CAN'T STOP CRYING

40:31.512 --> 40:33.347
'CAUSE OF THE SICK THINGS YOUR
PARTNER DID TO HER.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.266
YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE?

40:47.903 --> 40:50.823
UH, I SCREWED UP TODAY.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.408
THE GUY WENT.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.826
YEAH, BUT I DID IT WRONG.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.161
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:57.746 --> 40:58.414
MY BAD.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.332
PBBHHT.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.377

41:07.756 --> 41:08.632
GOOD NIGHT.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.722
YOU GOT TIME FOR A COFFEE BEFORE
YOU HEAD HOME?

41:15.639 --> 41:17.141

THAT VALERIE LOST THE BABY.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.125
THANKS.

41:45.252 --> 41:46.545
I'VE BEEN A REAL IDIOT
LATELY.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.297
IT'S NOT ALL ON YOU.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.842
NO, I SAW YOU BECOMING FRIENDS
WITH CLARK,

41:51.926 --> 41:54.512
AND I FELT THREATENED, AND I
ACTED OUT.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.640
I APOLOGIZE.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.394
ACCEPTED.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.232
THAT'S IT.
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

42:07.399 --> 42:10.402
HEY, AFTER I FINISH WITH ANGELA
IN CENTRAL BOOKING,

42:10.486 --> 42:13.030
I WAS GONNA WATCH THE KNICK

"SHOW ME" STATE AGAIN?

42:33.717 --> 42:34.593
MISSOURI.

42:35.302 --> 42:38.055
HERE'S TO THE "SHOW ME" STATE
OF MISSOURI --

42:38.180 --> 42:39.306
WHATEVER THE HELL
THAT MEANS.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.935
SHOW ME? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
SHOW ME WHAT?

42:43.143 --> 42:44.103
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.564
I THINK IT'S ABOUT THEM BEING
SKEPTICS OR SOMETHING.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.565
HMM.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.568
HEY, RITA, YOU EXPECTING YOUR
HUSBAND?

I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

42:56.865 --> 42:57.866

42:57.950 --> 43:01.954
ISN'T THIS COZY?
COZY, COZY, COZY.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.038

43:03.038 --> 43:04.790

43:04.873 --> 43:07.084
YOU KNEW WHAT, DON?
YOU'RE DRUNK. GO HOME.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.127
I'LL GET YOU A CAB.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.878
HOW LONG YOU BEEN BANGING HER,
TONY, HUH?

43:10.129 --> 43:11.672
DON'T MAKE AN ASS
OF YOURSELF.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.549
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE A WHITE GUY

43:13.549 --> 43:15.301
PULLING ONE OF YOUR GIRLS OUT OF
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

43:15.301 --> 43:16.927
DON'T COME BY OUR
STATION HOUSE AGAIN.

43:16.927 --> 43:17.761
I'M TELLING YOU.

43:17.761 --> 43:18.887
YOU BANGING HER, TOO,
TOUGH GUY?

43:19.054 --> 43:21.390
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO THROW
YOU OUT ON YOUR ASS.

43:21.974 --> 43:22.891
IT'S OKAY.

43:25.561 --> 43:26.854
I'M SORRY.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.314
JUST GO!

43:29.815 --> 43:30.816
I MISS YOU.

43:31.025 --> 43:31.942
OH, MY GOD.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.236
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I'VE
DONE,

43:34.445 --> 43:36.113
BUT I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOU,

43:36.196 --> 43:39.158
AND I'M JUST ASKING
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

43:39.325 --> 43:40.117
NO.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.201
I LOVE YOU.

43:41.201 --> 43:43.370
IT'S OVER!
YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT!

43:43.787 --> 43:45.247
NEITHER ONE OF US WAS
PERFECT.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.374
I NEVER CHEATED ON YOU,
DON.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.627
I KNOW YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT
TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER,

43:49.627 --> 43:50.794
BUT I NEVER DID.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.005
SO YOU WANT TO BE ENEMIES,
I GUESS, HUH?

43:53.255 --> 43:54.673
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

43:54.757 --> 43:55.758
ENEMIES IT IS.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.321
HERE YOU GO.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.908
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE GOT OUR COFFEE NOW.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.994
DID EVERYTHING GO ALL RIGHT
AFTER I LEFT LAST NIGHT?

44:24.078 --> 44:25.037
YEAH.

44:25.579 --> 44:26.747
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

44:27.164 --> 44:30.125
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.
YOU TRYING TO TALK ME INTO ONE?

44:30.125 --> 44:32.002
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING COMPLETELY
WEIRD TODAY.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.295
STOP IT.

44:35.464 --> 44:37.257
IS IT ABOUT ME KISSING YOU
LAST NIGHT?

44:37.758 --> 44:41.637
NO, WHAT WOULD THE BIG DEAL BE
ABOUT...YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD I...

44:44.848 --> 44:46.225
YEAH. YEAH, IT IS.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.059
ANDY...

44:48.727 --> 44:50.270
I LOVE YOU AND THEO DEARLY.

44:50.646 --> 44:51.730
I REALLY DO.

44:52.147 --> 44:53.315
AND LAST NIGHT, I WAS...

44:55.609 --> 44:58.612
I WAS JUST SO HAPPY,
IT JUST CAME OUT.

44:58.904 --> 45:01.699
I WASN'T TRYING TO BE COY
OR FLIRT.

45:01.907 --> 45:05.619
WELL, ALL IT DID WAS
MAKE ME THINK

45:06.453 --> 45:08.580
HOW WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF
TIME TOGETHER

45:09.039 --> 45:11.083
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE SPENDING YOUR
NIGHTS OUT THERE

45:11.083 --> 45:14.211
MEETING SOME GUY THAT YOU COULD
BE WITH, GO THE DISTANCE WITH.

45:15.921 --> 45:17.840
THANK YOU FOR LOOKING OUT
FOR ME LIKE THAT,

45:17.840 --> 45:18.924
BUT I'M FINE.

45:19.174 --> 45:22.386
AND THIS SPENDING TIME WITH YOU
AND THEO HAS MEANT A LOT TO ME.

45:23.178 --> 45:24.847
IT FEELS COMFORTABLE.

45:26.390 --> 45:27.725
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.645
AND I'VE BEEN HOPING...

45:32.563 --> 45:34.815
THAT IT'S BEEN MAKING YOU
FEEL GOOD, TOO.

45:37.234 --> 45:38.569
IT HAS.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.238
GOOD.

45:41.739 --> 45:46.326
ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE GONNA
NEED TO FIND SOMEONE YOUR AGE

45:46.410 --> 45:48.579
TO HAVE KIDS WITH AND START A
FAMILY WITH.

45:49.037 --> 45:50.247
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

45:50.372 --> 45:51.248
SURE IT WILL.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.250
YOU'LL FIND THE RIGHT GUY,
AND BOOM.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.835
I CAN'T HAVE KIDS.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.381
LIKE, PHYSICALLY, I'M NOT
ABLE TO.

46:00.090 --> 46:03.218
I HAD COMPLICATIONS WHEN I WAS
15 WHEN ALL THAT HAPPENED,

46:03.302 --> 46:06.221
AND, UH, I CAN'T.

46:07.139 --> 46:08.140
OH.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.811
SO SPENDING ALL THIS TIME
TOGETHER,

46:12.811 --> 46:14.521
IT'S ABOUT SPENDING TIME
WITH THEO.

46:17.649 --> 46:18.650
[ SIGHS ]

46:18.650 --> 46:22.279
IF THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU,
THEN OKAY.

46:23.697 --> 46:25.324
I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE
YOUR LIFE.
