NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:01.480 --> 01:02.600
Hi, Mr. Max.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.640
How's it going, Yoli? All ready?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.840
Yes, all packed and ready, sir.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.200
I'll put Ander on, okay?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.400
-Dad!
-Tiger.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.880
-Ready to travel?
-Yeah.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.120
We're not putting the guitar
in the trailer, right?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.840
How about up front?

01:19.920 --> 01:21.240
Of course.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.160
Hey, have you said goodbye
to your buddies?

01:23.240 --> 01:25.760
Sort of. Only David and Lucas.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.880
The others don't really like me.

01:29.960 --> 01:30.800
Right.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.160
Listen, son,
you can count your real friends

01:34.240 --> 01:37.200
on the fingers of one hand,
and there aren't many.

01:37.280 --> 01:40.600
You'll probably have fingers to spare.
So don't worry about it. All right, son?

01:40.680 --> 01:43.080
Okay, but don't be long, Dad.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.560
How much did he ask for?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.480
Half a million.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.400
-A year?
-A month.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.720
Lucero is here.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
You better stay put.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.200
These Colombians already know us.
One of us will be enough.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.880
Lucero!

03:15.400 --> 03:19.000
-There you are, mofo!
-Don't you ever change or what?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.800
-How are you, buddy?
-I'm fine.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.240
Got a light, guys?

03:28.160 --> 03:29.320
I was with your son yesterday.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.560
We agreed you'd support us
in the conclave of families.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.160
-My father can be president.
-And my son the treasurer.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.280
You always liked counting bills, huh?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.520
You and Tomasín. By the way,

03:45.880 --> 03:47.000
here it is.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.720
The conclave will be in half an hour.
Your father must be on his way.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.680
Let's make a toast.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.120
Cheers.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.160
To health and wealth.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.520
Papa San already transferred his part.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.760
I'll divert it to our secure accounts
and 18% to your reserve fund.

04:21.080 --> 04:21.920
Done.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.960
What did Dimitri say?

04:24.040 --> 04:26.400
He'll back you if the Colombians do.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.560
Romeo is greedy, but he's reasonable.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.600
Don't you think so?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.360
Five hundred thousand…

04:37.680 --> 04:38.520
a month.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.920
Tomasín!

04:45.520 --> 04:48.200
Tell these motherfuckers
to lower their weapons, buddy.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.960
-Motherfucker!
-Freeze!

04:55.800 --> 04:57.200
Don't move!

04:57.880 --> 05:00.000
Kill the fucking bastard!

05:03.560 --> 05:04.720
I'm here, motherfucker!

05:13.200 --> 05:15.080
This way! Quick! Bend down!

05:16.040 --> 05:17.400
Come on!

05:33.280 --> 05:34.400
Fucking Colombians.

05:34.480 --> 05:37.160
I knew it.
I told you they weren't to be trusted.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.360
Rafa!

05:40.680 --> 05:43.640
Call my father. Tell him Romeo backed out.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.560
The meeting's a trap.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.240
We need to spill some blood,
little brother.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.960
We have a problem.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.200
-You son of a bitch!
-Lucero!

07:17.400 --> 07:19.080
The taste of death.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.400
Please, don't! Please, don't kill us!

07:54.880 --> 07:56.320
Get up, you dirty rat.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.960
I can't stand this bastard.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.520
This wasn't the plan.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.480
No. But this bastard wanted
to fuck us up, and he lost.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.600
Now what?

08:23.240 --> 08:24.320
Father is on his way.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.560
-Will you talk with him?
-Yeah.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.240
Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.960
I know these things are tough for you,
but he'll understand.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.760
Go home.
A new life is waiting for you, bastard.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.480
You were like a brother.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.680
Faithful and loyal to my family.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.840
You deserve the best.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
Love you, bro.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.000
Me too.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.520
I'll miss you.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.240
Bet you will.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.720
Sunshine, beach.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.840
Your son running around.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.680
You'll be thinking about me all day.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.160
Take care.

09:06.000 --> 09:06.840
Bro.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.920
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Max.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.040
-Did you bring the pick?
-Come here.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.880
-How about a hello?
-Hello. Show it to me.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.360
Here it is.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.600
Tiger, you're getting stronger every day.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.680
Yoli, remember to give the keys
to the owner.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.600
Okay?

09:42.840 --> 09:43.960
Thanks for everything.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.040
You, get ready. We're finally leaving.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.480
-Good luck, Mr. Max.
-Thanks.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.560
Take care, Ander.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.160
Father.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.280
-How are you?
-Not good.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.520
I don't know
if the cancer will kill me first

10:07.680 --> 10:08.880
or your crazy ideas.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.720
Max?

10:12.840 --> 10:13.760
Where is he?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.560
You were meant to come here to pay.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.680
Not this.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.640
The final shot is mine.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.040
Father, it was a trap.
They planned to take me hostage.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.560
And make Romeo the head of the conclave.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.440
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.120
I was with him yesterday. We had a deal.

10:50.040 --> 10:53.200
I never got the impression
he was unsatisfied.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.720
But what do you think
the conclave will make of this?

10:58.480 --> 10:59.680
I'll disappear for a while.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.840
You have no idea how this business works

11:02.920 --> 11:05.680
unless it means spilling blood!

11:05.760 --> 11:07.880
Blood is necessary to make it work.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.520
Do you think this is America?

11:10.160 --> 11:11.840
This is Barcelona.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.120
Things don't work like that here,
understand?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.440
Since you came back from Japan,

11:22.440 --> 11:25.520
it's like you don't care
who lives and who dies.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.440
Son,

11:31.480 --> 11:33.800
you've changed, but not for the better.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.640
You sent me there.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.400
So that you'd learn
about the value of loyalty,

11:42.480 --> 11:43.560
the hierarchy--

11:43.640 --> 11:44.880
The Yakuza.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.680
Lucero,

11:47.600 --> 11:50.320
things are going to change.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.440
Yes.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.280
So I've heard.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.800
Cancel the transfers
and the clean-up team.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.560
I want everyone to see this.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.880
Your weakness puts us at risk, Father.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.560
Lucero, talk with your brother and sister.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.880
Let them explain it to you.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.400
You adopted María.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.280
And Max is just your hit man.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.200
A hit man who saved your life
on more than one occasion.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.920
You all grew up together.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.720
You're like brothers.

12:34.800 --> 12:37.440
We're not fucking brothers.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.360
I'm your only son!

12:40.440 --> 12:41.720
Your own flesh and blood!

12:42.880 --> 12:44.880
You were going to leave them in charge.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.080
No, I swear I wasn't.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.320
Head or heart?

12:51.840 --> 12:52.720
Dad?

12:53.240 --> 12:54.360
Head or heart?

12:59.080 --> 13:01.160
Head.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.080
I can't find María anywhere.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.800
Can you hear it, Dad?
I've been practicing all afternoon.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.720
Sounds good.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.840
When I'm famous, and on tour,
I'll dedicate this one to you.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.520
"This one is for my father!"

13:41.640 --> 13:42.840
Dad.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.920
What is it?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.440
There are people in the hallway.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.000
Hide, Ander!

15:02.600 --> 15:03.880
Ander, stay on the floor!

15:32.920 --> 15:34.880
Know who your son always reminds me of?

15:37.760 --> 15:38.760
My brother.

15:40.280 --> 15:41.120
Remember him?

15:42.080 --> 15:42.960
I don't know.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.080
The way he talks is the same, isn't it?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.040
You made Ricardo throw him out.

15:50.840 --> 15:55.640
What did you say? You said he was
too fond of blood or something like that.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.640
Finito, I didn't do anything
to your brother.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.680
I know.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.240
Yeah, I know, Máximo.
You didn't do anything.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.680
Is that why he committed suicide in jail?

16:08.080 --> 16:09.000
Please.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
He's my son.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.080
Don't worry.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.080
-Look.
-No!

16:40.160 --> 16:41.600
Tell me he didn't suffer.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.640
Didn't feel a thing, just like you wanted.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.840
-A happy end.
-Good job.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.800
-I knew I could trust you.
-Sure, you can.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.400
TWO YEARS LATER

17:06.760 --> 17:07.600
Daniela!

17:09.760 --> 17:10.720
It wasn't my fault.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.320
Damn tutorial, always the same.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.720
-Right.
-Leo!

17:14.800 --> 17:15.960
Come here a sec.

17:16.880 --> 17:17.760
Come here!

17:20.280 --> 17:21.160
Leo.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.640
You have one minute.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.720
-What's up? Got my gear?
-How are you?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.320
How much do you want? Twenty?

17:30.400 --> 17:31.240
Yeah.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.920
-Enjoy.
-Take care.

18:10.520 --> 18:14.360
If you had all the money in the world,
all the money you want, what would you do?

18:16.200 --> 18:19.000
We always said we'd go parachuting,
remember?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.320
I would buy myself a giant island.

18:34.800 --> 18:35.640
Hang on.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.000
GARAGE

19:00.920 --> 19:01.760
Hi!

19:02.320 --> 19:03.360
Anyone home?

19:08.800 --> 19:09.640
Did you see him?

19:19.280 --> 19:20.120
Hi.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.480
Hi.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.360
Hi there, Grandpa.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.800
It hasn't been the same
since Los Lobos were on.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.520
Here.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.120
Hey.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.520
There's a lot more than usual.
What are you up to?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.160
I got a new job at a garage.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.080
-The Gothic Quarter.
-Yeah.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.880
Near the square with the graffiti.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.160
-What you doing, Tomy?
-Math.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.400
You'll have to teach me.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.680
I suck at math.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.760
Grandpa will get mad
if he sees you with his guitar.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.720
And?

20:03.240 --> 20:04.280
How is your birthday going?

20:07.360 --> 20:08.240
Did Mom remember?

20:09.640 --> 20:11.080
She gave me this T-shirt.

20:14.040 --> 20:14.880
It's cool.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.360
Giving clothes as a present isn't cool.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.120
What a bummer. I bought you clothes too.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.280
Shall I return it?

20:26.360 --> 20:27.200
No.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.560
No?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.560
-Want it?
-Yeah.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.920
Come here.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.480
I knew you'd get--

20:45.160 --> 20:46.200
This is…

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Leo, this is the best one!

20:49.080 --> 20:49.960
Awesome!

20:50.040 --> 20:53.000
Don't let Mom see it. She could sell it.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.360
Hi.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.800
Where are you?

21:04.880 --> 21:06.840
Don't kid me. I know you're not out.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.000
The signal sucks.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.480
Where are you?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.280
Where are you?

21:13.360 --> 21:16.360
I'm at home. It's my brother's birthday.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.920
Blow out the candles real fast
and head over to Charm.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.320
Charm?

21:24.040 --> 21:25.960
Isn't that outside our turf?

21:26.040 --> 21:27.760
Not anymore. Got a problem?

21:27.840 --> 21:29.200
No, none.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.200
That brat is here again.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.160
Thanks, bro.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.360
Tell the boss it's the third time.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.280
Yes.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.120
Get off me! What the fuck are you doing?

21:49.520 --> 21:53.040
If I see you dealing in Charm,
I'll kill you.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.160
This is your last warning, okay?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.720
Help me, please!

21:58.800 --> 22:01.160
Help! I'm being mugged!

22:02.920 --> 22:04.440
Don't touch me again, you fat fuck!

22:04.520 --> 22:06.320
-What are you doing?
-You son of a bitch!

22:06.400 --> 22:07.760
Wanna die, or what?

22:07.840 --> 22:08.960
Get off him.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.400
What the fuck you looking at, buddy?

22:16.080 --> 22:18.080
Right! Go away and mind your own business.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.240
I feel like beating someone real hard.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.720
And you're asking for it.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.240
That was so cool, man.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.200
Hey!

22:49.960 --> 22:50.800
Hey, you!

22:52.080 --> 22:52.920
Wait!

22:56.040 --> 22:56.880
Hey.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.920
All right, dude.
I just wanted to thank you.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.560
That was amazing.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.080
That was so kick-ass.

23:23.920 --> 23:24.920
I can see you.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.000
Okay, dude. Well, thanks anyway.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.280
I'm outta here.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.920
I mean it, buddy. You were amazing.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.440
Stop making a fuss.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.480
I thought my place was a mess.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.480
-You live in a garage?
-I don't live here. I live in there.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.200
I prefer the garage.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.800
Is that a real '73 Gibson?

24:40.080 --> 24:41.600
You ask a lot of questions.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.320
Shit, that really stings.
What the hell is it?

24:47.840 --> 24:48.960
Disinfectant.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.960
Well, it hurts.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.600
Disinfectant doesn't hurt. Wounds do.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.160
Whatever you say.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.160
Do you play?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.040
No.

25:09.520 --> 25:10.640
It belonged to my son.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.760
Sweet present you gave him.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.200
All my old man gave me
before he left were beatings.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.680
But I'm not complaining.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.560
Things are looking up.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.400
Everyone makes a living
whatever way they can.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.320
I plan to quit as soon as I save a bit.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.080
My cousin is gonna get me a job
in his company. He earns a lot of dough.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.160
Right.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.240
Whatever you say, kid.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.160
Even though it's battered,
it's a pity you don't play it.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.920
See you, Bruce Lee!

26:18.960 --> 26:19.800
Dad.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.560
There are people in the hallway.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.360
Hide, Ander!

26:26.760 --> 26:28.720
Know who your son always reminds me of?

26:29.240 --> 26:30.640
My brother. Remember him?

26:31.160 --> 26:33.560
No!

26:37.360 --> 26:39.480
We only have one chance to catch Lucero.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.400
He's been missing for two years,
but we finally know where he'll turn up.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.440
The conclave.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.640
Yay!

26:47.440 --> 26:48.920
Time for another go!

26:50.040 --> 26:53.680
Time for another go. One, two… Yay!

26:53.760 --> 26:55.600
Now he's stood up.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.280
Fantastic!

27:03.520 --> 27:04.360
New players.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.760
Where's your boss?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.480
You don't say?

27:29.400 --> 27:31.360
Papa San, where?

27:35.600 --> 27:36.560
Go on, ask her.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.040
I'm Japanese. She's Chinese.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.000
We don't speak the same language.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.040
All right.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.440
Okay, arigato, everyone!

27:52.560 --> 27:54.160
Turn off that music, goddamn it!

27:54.960 --> 27:56.880
Let's see if we understand each other.

27:57.680 --> 28:00.040
Today, in the Chinese casino,

28:01.240 --> 28:02.320
in the "cachino,"

28:04.880 --> 28:06.520
we have a new gambling table.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.240
The nosey croupier's table, that's me.

28:11.120 --> 28:11.960
All right?

28:12.040 --> 28:15.440
I'll ask questions, and there's
a prize for whoever gets it right.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.400
And those who don't

28:19.640 --> 28:20.600
will be kicked out.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.240
First question.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.640
Where is Papa San?

28:28.680 --> 28:29.920
Easy, huh?

28:42.560 --> 28:43.560
Do you get me?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.320
Same question, ma'am.

28:49.560 --> 28:50.640
Where is Papa San?

28:52.800 --> 28:53.840
Nothing?

28:59.360 --> 29:00.920
It's Mr. Miyagi!

29:02.600 --> 29:04.560
Jesus. Professor Miyagi.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.560
That's enough.

29:22.520 --> 29:23.360
Papa San?

29:27.560 --> 29:29.280
What? Didn't know it was a woman?

29:31.840 --> 29:32.920
You're kidding me.

29:33.720 --> 29:34.560
Come over here.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.840
Hi, old friend. How are you?

29:46.920 --> 29:49.240
-You haven't changed.
-You too.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.680
You're still hiding
like the dirty rat you are,

29:54.280 --> 29:57.040
and you weren't even brave enough
to come here in person.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.240
I'm not hiding.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.720
I'm enjoying my free time with my family.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.400
Charito, here. Take her.

30:04.920 --> 30:08.400
Listen. First of all, I'd like to ask you

30:08.480 --> 30:10.440
to back me in the next conclave.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.400
I want to be the head.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.280
Your father was a good man.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.160
I was fond of him.
There was mutual respect.

30:19.240 --> 30:20.080
But you,

30:21.480 --> 30:23.400
I'll never back you.

30:24.680 --> 30:25.520
Forget it.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.240
All right, then consider this.

30:29.360 --> 30:30.880
A hostile takeover.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.080
Fucking Russians again.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.960
I told you, they're real bastards.
Charm is a shithole.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.360
-You have my dough. Give me my dough.
-Always bad news.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.000
Not much dough.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.360
They took half of it.
That's all I could save.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.000
If I tell you to go to Charm,
you go to Charm. Okay?

31:31.960 --> 31:32.800
Okay.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.440
Jackie Chan!

31:44.600 --> 31:47.520
Your playing sucks.
If you want, I'll tune it for you.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.760
My grandpa plays awesome
when he's not drunk.

32:00.040 --> 32:03.640
But he likes more flamenco, rumba.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.080
I play anything but that.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.480
Then form a band, kid.

32:11.560 --> 32:12.480
You're joking?

32:13.120 --> 32:16.360
Share the dough with others? No way.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.520
Now we're talking.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.840
Tuned.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.680
And free. No charge.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.400
I'm Leo.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.400
Max.

32:40.600 --> 32:41.440
Max.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.600
I can give you guitar lessons.

32:49.320 --> 32:50.840
And you can teach me a bit of…

32:56.600 --> 32:57.680
Why wait?

33:00.320 --> 33:01.240
Faster.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.480
Very well.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.000
Cover yourself.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.040
-Okay, see you.
-Guard. Strike.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.360
Guard. Strike.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.200
You thought I'd do it wrong?

33:35.000 --> 33:35.840
I can't go on.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.440
I'm outta here. That was awesome, dude.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.080
Call me. We can do it again.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.400
Bye, Chuck Norris!

34:11.800 --> 34:12.800
Here it is.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.760
What about you?

34:15.520 --> 34:16.400
Checkmate!

34:20.040 --> 34:21.680
What are you talking about?

34:51.560 --> 34:54.520
I need you to go to Barcelona in person.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.320
Speed things up with the Russians.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.280
We need to provoke them more.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.040
After what happened to Papa San,
the conclave wouldn't forgive me

35:04.120 --> 35:08.080
if I killed that scumbag Dimitri
and took over as leader.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.880
They have to see
we're defending ourselves.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.480
They attack us first.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.080
You can't do it.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.080
It's weird when you do it.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.880
Not like that.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.320
Like this.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.400
-Hi.
-What's up, bro?

35:36.320 --> 35:39.160
-You go back to Charm tonight.
-Jesus, dude.

35:40.160 --> 35:41.360
Can you send someone else?

35:41.880 --> 35:44.000
Tonight is the neighborhood fair.
Lots of people.

35:44.080 --> 35:45.440
We'll make a killing tonight.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.880
I don't wanna go. Send someone else.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.960
The Russians know
there'll be trouble if they touch you.

35:51.560 --> 35:55.000
We're like a family, Leo. Your family.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.480
If they touch you, it affects all of us.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.000
Little shit hung up on me.

36:04.720 --> 36:09.360
If I win the lottery,
I'll get you out of this shit you're in.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.560
Fucking kid. Go after him!

36:40.240 --> 36:41.440
Move!

36:44.120 --> 36:45.520
Over there!

36:51.720 --> 36:53.560
What the fuck is your game?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.960
First you hang up on me,
then you avoid me.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.000
I didn't recognize you, Jaro.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.920
What? Do you need glasses now?

37:10.600 --> 37:11.680
What are you doing?

37:11.760 --> 37:14.920
I heard you're making a bit on the side.
At my expense.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.120
That's a lie.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.040
I swear I haven't taken anything.

37:19.120 --> 37:21.720
-I'm clear. I swear.
-A lie? Let's see.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.080
Perhaps your pants are stuffed with bills.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.680
Take that away!

37:34.680 --> 37:35.840
Come here, you bastard.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.040
What are you doing, man?

37:44.280 --> 37:46.560
-If I tell you to go to Charm…
-Motherfucker!

37:47.200 --> 37:48.440
…you go to fucking Charm.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.960
I knew that the code would work.
Know where Leo is?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.320
Why would I?

38:15.280 --> 38:18.120
Because you're friends?
That's what he told me.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.640
Didn't you save him from the Russians?

38:25.840 --> 38:27.000
I can't find him.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.520
I asked around. No one knows where he is.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.520
He was siphoning off money.
If Jaro found him…

38:40.160 --> 38:42.640
Well, if you see him,
tell him to give me a ring.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.560
Okay?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.360
You're a bit weird, aren't you?

39:29.720 --> 39:32.280
I HEARD YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

39:34.440 --> 39:37.840
WHERE ARE YOU?

40:05.480 --> 40:06.520
What happened?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.840
That motherfucker Jaro did it.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.640
The bastard smashed up my hand.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.440
What did you expect?

40:17.400 --> 40:20.320
-You were stealing from them.
-I wasn't stealing from them.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.560
What do you expect
with the shit they pay me?

40:31.800 --> 40:34.800
I can't pay my old lady's rent,
certainly can't support them.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
Yeah, I stole.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.920
I was stealing.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.320
If I had a dad, this wouldn't happen.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.280
But I don't, so that's that.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.040
You need to see a doctor.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.680
No fucking way.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.480
If we go to a hospital,
they'll call my mom.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.880
I don't want problems with her,
believe me.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.120
She loses it when she gets mad.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.120
Don't mess it up for me.
Who are you calling?

41:15.640 --> 41:16.480
Wait here.

41:23.680 --> 41:26.200
-Thanks. I know this isn't the plan--
-Exactly.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.320
You know the conclave is in a week.
What the hell is this?

41:30.960 --> 41:33.240
-You've been distracted since that kid--
-Leo.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.960
His name's Leo.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.440
Tell him to get in. I'll deal with it.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.120
Hiya.

41:57.960 --> 41:58.800
And you.

41:59.680 --> 42:00.720
Focus.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.520
Go. Watch out for the bike.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.360
Any problem, partners?

42:15.560 --> 42:16.560
Let them through.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.120
Dimitri doesn't want trouble.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.280
They're Lucero's boys.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.840
Order a few Jager bottles
and bring me some good gear.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.400
I'll be out in a second.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.280
What the fuck you staring at?

42:52.600 --> 42:54.320
I'm into babes.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.720
And young guys too.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.240
Calling me a faggot? Do you know who--

43:03.240 --> 43:04.960
I don't give a shit who you are.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.240
Help me!

43:06.320 --> 43:08.480
Get this crazy fuck off me!

43:09.600 --> 43:10.640
Come on!

43:11.440 --> 43:12.480
Máximo?

43:14.520 --> 43:16.040
Why the fuck do you know him?

43:16.120 --> 43:17.760
Where are you going?

43:17.840 --> 43:19.400
Help me, goddamn it!

43:21.520 --> 43:23.760
Do you want money?
Is that what you want, dough?

43:25.920 --> 43:27.400
-Who do you work for?
-What?

43:30.360 --> 43:32.120
Beat his ass! Goddamn it!

43:37.120 --> 43:38.800
I won't ask you again, asshole.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.760
One question, one answer.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.520
Okay, I get it.

43:56.040 --> 43:58.840
His name's Urquiza, okay?

43:58.920 --> 44:01.360
But don't mess with him.
I'm telling you the truth.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.720
-Don't mess with him.
-You telling me what to do?

44:11.800 --> 44:16.360
Stop, please.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.040
You're hitting me, retards!

44:26.720 --> 44:27.800
Where is he?

44:27.880 --> 44:29.040
Where is he?

44:30.120 --> 44:31.760
Are you a total jerk or what?

44:31.840 --> 44:33.520
Why repeat everything I say?

44:34.600 --> 44:36.840
In Seven Rain. That's where he works.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.880
I don't know where he lives,
but he works there.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.080
Did you know the kid played guitar?

44:50.160 --> 44:52.960
Guitar? I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.440
You smashed up his hand.

44:55.520 --> 44:58.400
Are you fucking getting up?
Don't be a pussy.

45:23.760 --> 45:25.160
Now does it ring a bell?

45:28.280 --> 45:30.680
Fucking old man!

45:32.160 --> 45:33.120
Leo!

45:33.200 --> 45:34.680
You are talking about Leo!

45:41.040 --> 45:41.880
Man!

45:45.480 --> 45:46.560
Put your hands there.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.880
I don't get it. Are you his dad or what?

45:48.960 --> 45:51.080
He's just a fucking kid.
Who the fuck cares?

45:51.160 --> 45:52.840
Put your hands there,
or it'll be your head.

45:52.920 --> 45:54.160
Don't, please!

45:54.680 --> 45:56.440
My organization will come after you.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.280
Did you hear me?

45:58.360 --> 46:00.800
No! Please don't!

46:00.880 --> 46:04.120
When you come, bring coffee.
I'll serve the biscuits.

46:37.200 --> 46:38.240
Where is he?

46:38.760 --> 46:41.320
I fixed up his hand
and gave him something to sleep.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.000
Want to train a bit?

46:56.040 --> 46:57.040
Want a thrashing?

47:12.360 --> 47:13.800
Find out anything new?

47:14.560 --> 47:17.160
The kid works for people
who want to screw the Russians.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.680
You're risking two years' work
for someone you don't even know.

47:25.760 --> 47:26.760
He's a kid, María.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.000
A kid who's distracting you from our plan.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.560
We talked about it a thousand times.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.640
We only have one chance to catch Lucero.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.520
The conclave.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.320
There's a date.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.280
He'll be there.

47:48.160 --> 47:51.120
Two years without a trace,
now we know where he'll be.

47:52.480 --> 47:53.880
It's our only chance.

47:59.240 --> 48:02.480
If the families forgive him,
he'll be untouchable.

48:03.320 --> 48:05.320
Stop worrying about me and train harder.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.760
Let go. You're hurting me!

48:36.600 --> 48:38.000
Cut it out, María!

48:40.120 --> 48:41.480
The guys screwing Dimitri…

48:42.600 --> 48:43.600
Got a name?

48:49.520 --> 48:51.080
Urquiza. Ring a bell?

48:53.920 --> 48:54.760
No.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.680
But I'll check it out.

49:01.800 --> 49:05.240
If they work for Lucero and saw you,
we'll have to move again.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.200
My father's reserve fund is almost empty.

49:38.880 --> 49:41.880
Jesus! My God. I see you provoked them,
and it worked. Well done, Jaro.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.720
It wasn't the Russians.

49:43.800 --> 49:44.880
Doesn't look like it.

49:44.960 --> 49:46.840
It was some crazy fuck, okay?

49:46.920 --> 49:48.800
-Some crazy fuck.
-A crazy fuck?

49:51.200 --> 49:52.040
Towel.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.200
One of the kids I use
to provoke them has a…

49:58.280 --> 50:01.360
I don't know.
A father, an uncle, a boyfriend.

50:01.440 --> 50:03.400
Don't you have a boyfriend
who protects you, Jaro?

50:06.040 --> 50:10.640
That motherfucker was a combination
of John Wayne and Bruce Lee.

50:12.080 --> 50:14.240
He beat the shit out of us
without blinking.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.280
John Wayne and Bruce Lee?

50:19.560 --> 50:22.040
Does he work for them? Was he Russian?

50:22.640 --> 50:24.720
He wasn't Russian, damn it!

50:24.800 --> 50:28.360
He was only there
because I warned some fucking kid

50:28.440 --> 50:29.720
who nobody cares about!

50:29.800 --> 50:32.320
He was stealing money from us, okay?

50:34.600 --> 50:37.520
Can you believe one of my men
ran away when he saw the guy?

50:37.600 --> 50:38.960
He ran away!

50:39.040 --> 50:39.880
Towel.

50:40.880 --> 50:41.920
Maybe he knew him?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.760
I guess so.
Yeah, he called him by his name.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.520
So he did know him, Jaro.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.040
Yeah, what was it?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.280
Shit, what was the name?

50:51.640 --> 50:54.200
-Like in that movie about the Romans.
-Spartacus?

50:54.280 --> 50:56.600
No, why would he be called that?

50:56.680 --> 51:00.160
The other one, the good one. Gladiator.

51:03.400 --> 51:04.560
What's his name?

51:04.640 --> 51:05.720
Jesus, what was it?

51:07.160 --> 51:09.400
-Máximo.
-That's it. Máximo.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.320
Máximo, motherfucker.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.320
Do we know where that kid lives?

51:50.920 --> 51:52.480
-Where are you going?
-Home.

51:53.120 --> 51:56.400
Kid, if they are looking for you,
it's the first place they'll go.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.960
I know,
but I'm not going to wait here forever.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.400
Thanks for everything, huh?

52:05.120 --> 52:07.280
And you?
Are you going to do something or what?

52:29.520 --> 52:31.280
BE ALERT
CALL ME IF YOU SEE THE KID

52:31.360 --> 52:33.480
DON'T GO UP
DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE COME

52:33.560 --> 52:34.920
Great.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.600
Stop.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.200
-Got a little brother?
-Yeah.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.800
Always watching cartoons.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.880
-Wait. I'll go in first.
-Max, chill out. Take it easy.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.600
Trick or treat!

53:05.600 --> 53:06.840
Happy Halloween!

53:07.560 --> 53:09.000
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

53:10.080 --> 53:12.120
Hi! You're just in time.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.600
Grandma, do you want
to play trick or treat with us?

53:28.920 --> 53:30.160
You must be Leo, right?

53:31.760 --> 53:33.640
Just talking about you with your mom.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.280
And about your new job at the garage.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.440
What have you done?

53:51.320 --> 53:52.520
You son of a bitch!

53:55.000 --> 53:56.480
You!

54:33.880 --> 54:35.360
You should be dead, bastard.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.600
Like your brother or like my son?

54:50.600 --> 54:52.680
Leo! Take it easy, don't do it.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.640
-Get out of the way, Max.
-Please, Leo.

54:54.720 --> 54:55.960
Get out of the way!

54:56.040 --> 54:57.440
Put the gun down.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.760
Get out of the way!

55:02.360 --> 55:04.320
-Let him go.
-I'll let him go now.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.440
Look, I'm doing it.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.960
I'm letting him go, man.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.280
-The kid was the perfect excuse.
-Sure.

56:02.360 --> 56:05.520
They wanted the Russians to kill him
so the conclave couldn't object.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.120
Lucero was just defending himself.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.000
And Finito?

56:11.440 --> 56:12.280
Did he see you?

56:13.720 --> 56:14.560
Yes.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.400
I couldn't finish him off.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.120
Fuck! I don't believe it!

56:19.840 --> 56:21.280
You screwed up our plan.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.560
When Lucero finds out you're alive,
it'll be impossible to catch him.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.720
Or even worse, he won't turn up.

56:28.240 --> 56:29.640
Know what you've just done?

56:30.480 --> 56:32.240
How could I be such a jerk?

56:33.280 --> 56:34.800
They killed them because of me.

56:37.120 --> 56:37.960
Leo.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.000
Leo.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.400
-Take it easy.
-You guys don't get it.

56:47.040 --> 56:50.240
You've no fucking idea
what I'm feeling right now.

56:50.320 --> 56:54.680
It hurts so bad, right here in my chest.

56:54.760 --> 56:55.600
Leo.

56:56.120 --> 56:58.200
They killed his son two years ago.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.320
They killed my father too.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.280
I completely understand your pain.

57:08.160 --> 57:11.280
It's the same one that breaks
and destroys us every single day.

57:15.640 --> 57:17.640
It doesn't let you move on or forget.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.160
Max.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.720
When I got you out of that house,

58:08.400 --> 58:10.320
all I felt was pain and anger.

58:14.080 --> 58:16.480
I couldn't believe
we'd been betrayed like that.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.360
But…

58:22.880 --> 58:25.400
I think that now is the time
to look for alternatives.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.440
We should leave here

58:30.400 --> 58:32.240
and calmly think up another plan.

58:36.960 --> 58:37.800
Or just quit.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.200
Besides,

58:45.840 --> 58:46.680
the kid…

58:48.440 --> 58:49.880
the kid doesn't have anyone.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.880
Running away isn't my style.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.400
I hacked Urquiza's phone.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.320
Perfect.

59:08.440 --> 59:09.960
Actually, it's not that great.

59:10.720 --> 59:12.680
Finito called him to request backup

59:12.760 --> 59:15.000
for a party at your garage.
They're on their way.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.160
Did Finito tell him who I am?

59:18.120 --> 59:19.600
-No.
-I knew it.

59:20.120 --> 59:23.400
I know that motherfucker. He wants
to sort it out before Lucero hears.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.440
-We still have time.
-I'll think of something.

59:27.280 --> 59:28.640
There's only one plan.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.400
I'm going to kill them all.

1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:02.080
Hello.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:03.040
Hello, Dimitri.

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:04.920
Long time since we spoke.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:06.800
We need to have a chat.

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:04.840
The garage burned down.

1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:08.440
We need to get him there sooner.
Tell me about Urquiza.

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.640
From what I could gather,

1:04:10.720 --> 1:04:12.360
Urquiza is the manager of a club.

1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:16.800
Seven Rain. It's actually a cover
for Lucero's money laundering.

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:20.400
Urquiza is a drunk
with his fingers in the till.

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.720
Rafa turns a blind eye
because he's his friend.

1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:24.920
But Lucero thinks he's a jerk.

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.680
And he has terrible taste in shoes.

1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.520
María, the club.

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:33.160
Max, it's best if you go through the back.

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:40.960
Sorry, sir, you can't park there.

1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:42.440
We're closed.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.520
Take it around the back.

1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:45.960
Scratch it, you pay for it.

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:50.520
Didn't you hear the new guy?

1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:51.800
We're closed.

1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:11.200
Seven Rain, let's see.

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:12.600
Beat it.

1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:16.120
A turnover of 10 million euros a month.

1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:19.000
Except today. They expect 98 million euros

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:22.360
that Lucero has to deliver
before meeting the conclave.

1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:24.800
Peace has a price.

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:27.360
I'll swing by and have a drink.

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:40.720
Who's that fucker?

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:50.280
It's a big operation.
There'll be lots of guards. About 18.

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:53.720
Six at the main entrance.

1:05:55.800 --> 1:05:57.000
Six inside.

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:00.120
And six between the storeroom
and the backdoor.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:02.640
Fuck, he's over there!

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:06.200
That's where suppliers go in,
plus the money to be laundered.

1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:08.920
How do they do it?

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:16.080
They go in camouflage in a van
with equipment for gigs.

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:19.040
But instead of lights,
the boxes are full of bills.

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:21.760
They must deliver it personally
to Urquiza in his office.

1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:23.560
Clean and simple.

1:06:23.640 --> 1:06:26.080
How long before the van arrives?

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:27.280
You have about 20 minutes.

1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:31.520
Fuck!

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:35.480
I'll send a message to Lucero
so he crawls out of his hole.

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:38.840
But, Max, why not come here
and we'll think up another plan?

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:07.160
No!

1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:08.320
Where are you going?

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:15.360
No!

1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:26.240
-You know Lucero, right?
-Yes.

1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:28.640
Good. Give him this message.

1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:47.440
You. Take out what's inside.

1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:50.160
Put it in the trailer. Hurry!

1:07:53.960 --> 1:07:55.000
All of it?

1:07:56.800 --> 1:07:57.640
All of it.

1:08:10.840 --> 1:08:12.280
I…

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:15.280
I can't…

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.320
Rafa.

1:08:17.400 --> 1:08:20.600
He was an animal, Rafa, an animal.

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:22.520
Wanna drink?

1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:26.560
Explain properly. I don't understand.

1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:29.720
Did the Russians do this or what?

1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:32.120
I'm a bookkeeper, Rafa.

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:36.680
I'm a bookkeeper. I don't know.

1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:41.000
Some guy who spoke Spanish, same as me.

1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:45.640
He stormed in here and killed all of them.

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:50.480
And he gave me a message for Lucero.

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:52.160
-A guy--
-A guy?

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:53.520
Spoke like me.

1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:55.000
A guy by himself?

1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:57.800
A guy by himself, Rafa.

1:08:57.880 --> 1:08:59.560
-He--
-Shut up.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:00.840
A guy…

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:02.760
What was the fucking message?

1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:05.640
Heart…

1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:08.880
No! Head or heart?

1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:13.800
Head or heart?

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.560
And he gave me this cell phone.

1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:17.960
This cell.

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:23.320
He's going to call Lucero in 24 hours.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.560
And Lucero has to pick up.

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:31.120
Lucero, here, in Barcelona,
and the worst part is…

1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:37.680
the guy knew where the cash was.

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:46.240
Rafa, how will you tell Lucero
about the cash?

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:51.760
Huh?

1:10:18.080 --> 1:10:19.040
Lie down.

1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:25.480
-What happened?
-It's nothing. Don't worry.

1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:26.720
Nothing?

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:29.720
It's a serious wound. I'll need
to sedate you to take the bullet out.

1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:40.200
Max, that trailer is full of money.

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.640
Forget the sedative.

1:10:42.720 --> 1:10:45.360
Lucero probably got the message by now.
They'll be looking for me.

1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:46.480
Okay, this'll hurt.

1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:51.720
Why do you never listen to me?
Yet here I am.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:53.600
Who the fuck shot you?

1:10:54.120 --> 1:10:55.120
Know what?

1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:57.960
They're going to kill you,
and I won't be here to see it.

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.920
What the hell is up with you guys?

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.640
You're like two fucking kids.

1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:10.000
I hope this will shut you up for a while.

1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:16.800
Take the next one out yourself, you jerk.

1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:30.280
How is my favorite Russian?

1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:31.560
Good. And you?

1:11:31.640 --> 1:11:32.640
Fine. Just arrived.

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:33.600
Are you in Barcelona?

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.240
Yeah. All good here.

1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:36.720
Are you broke?

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:39.120
No, that's just rumors. Bullshit.

1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:41.240
Trust me, we're fine.
See you in a few days.

1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:42.760
Bye.

1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.080
Did that guy say, "Head or heart"?

1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:49.240
I wasn't there,
but Urquiza said that was the question.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:51.000
I want him to tell me to my face.

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:55.840
He kept the cash too.

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:20.360
I just blew out the candles
on my daughter's first birthday cake

1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:21.720
on FaceTime.

1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:26.240
And I have to be here with you guys
instead of being with them.

1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.200
Jesus Christ. That makes me…

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:30.960
Pissed?

1:12:32.200 --> 1:12:33.040
Screwed.

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:36.720
Lucero.

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:37.760
Why is he tied up?

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.360
Aren't there enough men here?

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:42.920
Oh my goodness.

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:44.320
Hold this.

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:48.520
Why is there black plastic underneath?

1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.200
-Get away from me.
-Thank you.

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:54.840
98 million vanished? Doesn't matter.

1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:57.520
My reconciliation with the conclave?

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:00.040
-I'll think of something.
-Yes.

1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:03.000
I'm sure we will think of something.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:04.560
Yes, but in return…

1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:12.840
I need to know everything
about that motherfucker.

1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:17.240
The color of his hair, his skin,
his eyebrows, his eyes, type of nose.

1:13:17.880 --> 1:13:20.240
Everything.
If he pisses standing up or sitting.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:21.800
Start talking.

1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:25.720
You can see it recorded
on the CCTV cameras.

1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:30.040
Black and white.
A guy like me. He had a beard. His eyes…

1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:33.640
I don't remember.
He was crazy, went ape shit.

1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:37.080
He got into the Porsche

1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:42.000
and put your cash in the trailer.

1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:43.400
I didn't talk to anyone.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:46.720
What you're going to promise me,
here and now,

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.640
is that you'll never blab again.

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:50.640
No.

1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:53.320
Never.

1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:56.880
Done.

1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:58.240
All sorted.

1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:00.640
Huh?

1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:08.000
No.

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:09.920
No!

1:14:13.160 --> 1:14:15.040
-What's that?
-To cut out your tongue.

1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:16.480
No!

1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:19.440
Then my buddies will take you
to the hospital,

1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.640
sew you up, physio--

1:14:21.720 --> 1:14:23.200
It can't be sewn.

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:25.640
-Lucero, I can't do it.
-You can't?

1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:27.720
-How long have I…
-You can't?

1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:29.840
You can't do this to me.

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.320
But you can screw me over?

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:35.480
You can let some crazy guy
steal 98 million from me!

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:38.440
Behave like a man!

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.520
Show me respect and loyalty!

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:42.040
You can't do that?

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:46.560
Give me that fucking knife!

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.560
-Open your mouth! Open it!
-No!

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:51.720
Come here. Open your mouth! Open it!

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:52.960
Open!

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:04.000
He struggled too much.

1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:05.880
I stuck it in his eye.

1:15:08.520 --> 1:15:09.520
Is this the phone?

1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:11.320
Give it to me.

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.520
You had it way too long.

1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:18.200
Bring me my cake.

1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:27.080
Where's Finito?

1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:28.000
He's on his way.

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.400
He said he had trouble with Jaro.

1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:35.280
Lots of blood.

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:39.360
There are a few loose ends,
but everything is under control.

1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:46.200
What the fuck is your problem?

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:49.080
Cruelty makes us weak.

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.800
It makes them respect me.

1:15:52.880 --> 1:15:55.800
They fear you. They don't respect you.

1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:57.720
Fear is enough for me.

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:01.600
Do I look weak to you?

1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:03.960
Is that it?

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.840
There is no honor without respect.

1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:08.920
Don't give me that!

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:13.400
I don't believe in codes

1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:14.720
or any of that bullshit!

1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:17.520
That was what killed Máximo.

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:20.120
You killed him.

1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.760
You killed him and his son.

1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:24.360
He was weak.

1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:26.640
Weak for having a son?

1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:12.600
Where is he?
The big guy with the ponytail?

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:30.640
Shit!

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:32.400
Tell me, or I'll plug you.

1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:36.040
You mean him?

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:42.080
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.480
What are you looking at? Huh?

1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:07.560
Why did you come? Huh?

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:09.240
Why did you come?

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:18.040
Listen up, kid.

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:21.720
I don't know what you're looking for,
but I know what I want.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:23.920
Máximo.

1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:27.800
Where the hell is he?

1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:31.200
Come on. Please pick up.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:42.400
-Who's the kid?
-It's personal.

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:45.160
-What do you mean by that?
-It's personal.

1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:47.240
Beat it.

1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:49.400
Max will kill you.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:52.480
Max? Wasn't he dead?

1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:55.480
-He'll kill you.
-I'll take care of him.

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:16.920
Just what I needed.

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:44.200
Let me see.

1:19:47.560 --> 1:19:48.400
Jesus.

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:53.600
Hey, kid. Hang in there.

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:56.000
We're nearly there.

1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:13.960
Come on.

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:29.640
Come on.

1:20:33.680 --> 1:20:36.000
-You told me he was dead.
-Because he was.

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:37.320
You swore to me, Finito.

1:20:38.280 --> 1:20:41.640
I even heard you bragging
you'd killed him barehanded.

1:20:41.720 --> 1:20:43.080
He was dead, Lucero.

1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:46.080
I don't know
how the fuck he got out alive.

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:48.440
But he did, didn't he?

1:20:50.360 --> 1:20:53.040
Now all he wants is to take revenge,
regain his honor.

1:20:57.960 --> 1:20:59.000
Let me sort it out.

1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:00.840
I don't know.

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:06.120
I need to speak with the conclave.
In person.

1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:10.040
Bring it forward, ask for protection.

1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:11.760
You'd lower yourself, Lucero.

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:14.720
Go on, get out of here.

1:21:15.400 --> 1:21:16.440
Move it.

1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:24.960
Hello.

1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:26.720
Dimitri. How are you, friend?

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:28.000
Good, and you?

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:31.080
Fine. Listen, I have a favor to ask.

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:34.400
I know this is complicated,
but you can help me.

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:42.360
Last night they tailed them
to the hospital.

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:44.560
They're still there.
What do I say to them?

1:22:58.120 --> 1:22:59.040
Come on!

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:01.920
Please leave your message after the tone.

1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:05.880
Listen, I'm at Hospital del Mar, room 512.

1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:07.600
Leo went to find Finito,

1:23:07.680 --> 1:23:10.160
and he got beaten so hard
he can hardly breathe.

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:20.840
My old friend.

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.120
Ex-friend.

1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:27.080
I always thought
that you'd be the boss one day.

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:29.480
A boss with values, with morals.

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:30.920
You're a traitor.

1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:33.840
You abandoned Ricardo.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:35.760
You left Lucero as the only choice.

1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:12.080
You should have stayed.

1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:16.520
You should have been the boss.
You screwed up everything.

1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:19.720
And Lucero, who more than disowned you,

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:22.640
ended up doing the same as you!

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.440
-Where can I find him?
-Too late.

1:26:31.040 --> 1:26:34.040
He moved the conclave forward
to be under their protection.

1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:35.360
How will he pay them?

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:36.880
I have his money.

1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.280
Don't worry about that.
I'll take it back to him.

1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:41.720
He'll be untouchable after the conclave.

1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:43.800
Lucero beat you.

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:45.240
Once again.

1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:05.000
Thanks for the information.

1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:36.400
We're the first here.

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:38.960
Whatever.

1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:50.120
Everyone to their posts.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.200
You steal my money.

1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:27.800
You kill my people.

1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:31.040
Show your face, motherfucker.

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:33.840
Have some honor.

1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:38.600
Do you hear me?

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:50.480
You have one new voicemail.

1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:52.160
Max.

1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:58.000
Listen, I'm at Hospital del Mar, room 512.

1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:02.600
Leo went to find Finito,

1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:05.040
and he got beaten so hard
he can hardly breathe.

1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:12.040
The time has come to quit.

1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:15.400
We've dealt with this shit for two years.

1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:17.920
And for what?

1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:22.160
They've destroyed Leo's family.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:24.480
And they've destroyed us.

1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:30.480
I couldn't stand seeing you die again.

1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:36.400
So I'm taking the kid with me,

1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:42.880
far away from all this endless violence

1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.120
that only kills those you love.

1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:52.800
I hope that…

1:29:54.560 --> 1:29:55.760
you come with us.

1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:00.160
Speak later. Think about it.

1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:25.000
I'm sorry.

1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:27.720
I couldn't take it.

1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:30.640
I told them where you were.

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:35.080
Don't worry.

1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:37.800
I'm still here.

1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:40.600
You were really brave.

1:30:43.280 --> 1:30:44.200
Brave?

1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:47.800
That guy destroyed everything I loved.

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.520
And I couldn't even give him a bruise.

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.160
What good is being brave?

1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:01.480
If you hadn't stood between us
at my house,

1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:04.920
I swear that guy would be dead now.

1:31:07.280 --> 1:31:10.040
I know it wouldn't bring back my family…

1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:12.600
He should be resting.

1:31:14.040 --> 1:31:15.480
It's best you let him sleep.

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:23.600
…but I'd feel better.

1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:29.280
Much better.

1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:52.440
Lucero.

1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:55.080
It's him.

1:31:55.640 --> 1:31:56.480
He's here.

1:31:58.520 --> 1:31:59.360
Of course he is.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.360
I'll be Yakuza!

1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:35.960
He's waiting for you.

1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:43.000
Back up!

1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:20.280
The brother who came back from the dead.

1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:25.840
I'm not your brother, motherfucker.

1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:27.680
Christ.

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:29.160
You've finally accepted it.

1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:31.960
No, we're not brothers.

1:35:32.600 --> 1:35:33.560
But my father…

1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:36.560
My father loved you as a son.

1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.200
I did have a son.

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:40.520
-And you had him murdered!
-That's also true.

1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:44.720
You'd be with him
if it weren't for Finito.

1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:49.320
But you insisted on abandoning him
on his journey to heaven.

1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:51.800
I didn't abandon anyone.

1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:54.080
I earned my right to choose my own way.

1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:56.200
You didn't choose anything, jerk.

1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:00.400
My father chose it for us.

1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:02.280
How ironic.

1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:05.120
Father was annoyed
I wanted to be exactly like him.

1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:09.840
As time went by, he began to fear me.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:12.440
He loved you though.

1:36:13.240 --> 1:36:14.720
He respected you!

1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:16.920
I'm not here to discuss Ricardo.

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:20.320
I came to kill you.

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:13.240
Let's spill some blood, little brother.

1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.400
Well done, little brother.

1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:36.880
You don't drop the katana anymore.

1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:01.840
Those little Buddhas taught you well.

1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:06.600
One more?

1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:07.960
One more.

1:39:20.840 --> 1:39:22.520
Wait.

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:25.560
It seems you were right about honor.

1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:27.040
I don't have any.

1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:28.880
Finito!

1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:30.360
Look who came to see us.

1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:34.160
Little sister!

1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:36.280
María!

1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:42.760
A family reunion.

1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:48.800
Come on.

1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:56.520
Come here.

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:58.040
Let's see, now.

1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:43.480
I don't recognize you, Máximo.

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:44.680
I don't recognize you.

1:40:57.320 --> 1:40:58.160
Finito.

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.520
Finish your fucking job once and for all.

1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:01.880
Get to it.

1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:08.280
Come here, sis.

1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.800
Second time's the charm, motherfucker.

1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:17.960
Sit over here nice and still.

1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:20.680
Rot in hell.

1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:23.080
Bastard.

1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:47.240
Head or heart?

1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:52.520
Will you spare my family?

1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:05.280
The same way you
and your men spared Leo's family?

1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:06.480
Screw you!

1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:16.120
Cool wheels.

1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:17.720
Really cool.

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:20.920
It's a bit small, don't you think?

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:32.360
I'll get in the back.

1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:35.920
But don't get used to it.
There are still hierarchies in life.

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:37.200
Keep that in mind.

1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:46.160
Leo. Did you say goodbye to your friend?

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:48.120
Of course.

1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:53.240
Friends are important.

1:45:57.280 --> 1:45:58.120
Aren't they?

1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.600
UNKNOWN NUMBER

1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:22.920
Hello?

1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:24.640
My dear María.

1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:26.160
I was waiting for your call.

1:46:26.240 --> 1:46:28.960
Not for you to run off. Are we good?

1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:31.080
You tell me. Are we good?

1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:33.040
We ruined the conclave for you.

1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:34.400
The conclave is tomorrow.

1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:36.320
The only thing I did

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:37.680
was set a time and place

1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:39.240
for our meeting with Lucero.

1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:40.600
What?

1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:42.440
I never thanked you

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:45.080
for calling me to save Max.

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:47.400
It was very useful.

1:46:51.840 --> 1:46:53.120
What's up?

1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:55.600
-I was thinking that…
-What?

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.720
Not this dumb stuff again?

1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:07.000
Can you save it for another time?

1:47:07.080 --> 1:47:09.280
It's not too much to ask, is it?

1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:12.160
It's really gross, seriously.

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:04.240
