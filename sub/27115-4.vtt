- Previously

00:03.033 --> 00:03.500
- Previously
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:06.367 --> 00:09.166
You just kissed
a pinkie promise with me.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.166
- You've been used
to wanting to make sure

00:12.200 --> 00:13.633
you're friends with everyone,

00:13.667 --> 00:16.467
that it ends up just ----ing
biting you in the ass

00:16.500 --> 00:19.100
because you have no loyalty
to anyone.

00:19.133 --> 00:21.500
- So you've been
sleeping with James

00:21.533 --> 00:24.100
since Coachella
two years ago?

00:24.133 --> 00:26.100
- I've been sleeping with him
for three years.

00:26.133 --> 00:30.100
- I just feel like
I need more proof.

00:30.133 --> 00:32.100
- Come on,
you cannot be this dumb.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.500
- I'm not dumb, Lala.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.300
- That's offensive!
- As someone who's supposed

00:35.333 --> 00:38.600
to support other women,
I feel like you're not.

00:38.633 --> 00:41.033
- Like, what's going on with
your

00:42.533 --> 00:44.567
Those shorts
aren't working for you, babe.

00:49.233 --> 00:50.600
- No.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.133
The James that I see
treats me like a queen.

00:53.166 --> 00:56.333
- I am not willing to work
in a place that is tolerated.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.500
say and do whatever
he wants to anyone.

01:29.533 --> 01:32.133
I just--I had just had enough.

01:32.166 --> 01:35.200
If he's still working here,
I will not.

01:35.233 --> 01:38.433
- So, basically,
it's an ultimatum.

01:38.467 --> 01:41.467
- I've only given
one ultimatum in my life,

01:41.500 --> 01:44.133
and that was to Tom.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.600
And that worked,
so maybe this is an ultimatum.

01:49.300 --> 01:50.700
- Over nine years,

01:50.734 --> 01:53.333
Katie hasn't ever
given me an ultimatum.

01:53.367 --> 01:55.166
You never hear a peep
out of her.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.667
You've just got to trust me
to deal with it, okay?

01:57.700 --> 02:00.266
But this decision
actually affects

02:00.300 --> 02:01.667

02:01.700 --> 02:04.200
Tuesday has been
very successful,

02:04.233 --> 02:07.533

02:07.567 --> 02:11.734
kind of on a daily basis
of what they're making.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.500
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.200
How are you?

02:15.233 --> 02:16.500
- Yeah.

02:16.533 --> 02:18.567
- It's hard for me
to make this decision.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.166
I need to talk to you.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.567
I just had a conversation
with Katie.

02:25.700 --> 02:26.734
Bad news.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.700
- No.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.200
It's just, we have
to sort something out.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.367
- Okay.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.133
- Katie came to me
and she just said

02:35.166 --> 02:37.467
that he was body-shaming her.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.233
- James.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.633
- You know, just putting it
out, putting it out.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.367
Said, "I don't want
to work in a place

02:48.400 --> 02:50.300
that supports
someone like him."

02:54.266 --> 02:55.633
People are coming
to see him play.

We're gonna party all night!

03:09.433 --> 03:12.367
What we gonna do?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.734

the last part of my transition.

03:38.567 --> 03:39.734
- Wow.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.700
- They're taking
all the fat

03:41.734 --> 03:44.533
and then inject it all
in my ass and my hips.

03:44.567 --> 03:45.633
- Yes.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.433
- After ten years of waiting,

03:48.467 --> 03:50.400
You know,
going to male to female,

03:50.433 --> 03:52.433
I'm achieving something
that I've always dreamed of,

03:52.467 --> 03:54.000
so it's pretty magical.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.567
Surgery is five hours,
and I'm actually staying

03:56.600 --> 03:58.700
at a place in Santa Monica
overnight.

03:58.734 --> 04:00.633
- Santa Monica, that's, like,
five minutes from me

04:00.667 --> 04:04.266
so, like, literally, I just
have to finish moving today

04:04.300 --> 04:06.367
and then I'll be
in Marina all night.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.533
I've been wanting to make
the move to the west side

04:08.567 --> 04:10.367
in the Marina
for so many years,

04:10.400 --> 04:12.000
and I just never
had the balls to do it.

04:12.033 --> 04:14.333
James is gonna help me
finish moving and whatnot,

04:14.367 --> 04:16.200
but I was like,
"We need to talk."

04:16.233 --> 04:18.000
Call me an asshole, but, like,

04:18.033 --> 04:20.433
James did already agree to help
me move out of my apartment.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.367
We are neighbors
in my old spot,

04:22.400 --> 04:26.700
so I figure I can kill
two birds with one stone,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.266
have him pack up my car,
get that out of the way,

04:29.300 --> 04:31.200
and then I'm gonna sit his ass
down and put him in his place.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.300
Literally what just
put me over the edge

04:33.333 --> 04:35.433
is when Stassi told me what
he said to Katie at Pride.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.367
She's like, "This is our issue
with you, Scheana,

04:37.400 --> 04:38.367
You have no loyalty."

04:38.400 --> 04:40.567
And, like, I don't want

04:40.600 --> 04:41.700
to have to say
these things to him,

04:41.734 --> 04:43.300
but, like,
I'm sick of people

04:43.333 --> 04:44.633
feeling like
I'm not a loyal friend.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.667
I need to take a stand
and make decisions.

04:47.700 --> 04:52.033
- This feels like classic
old-school Scheana.

04:52.066 --> 04:54.266
Like, she has
to take drastic action

04:54.300 --> 04:57.633
to prove her loyalty
to Katie, Kristen, and Stassi.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.600

friends with James

04:59.633 --> 05:01.667
and still try to be friends
with the other girls.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.266

05:05.500 --> 05:06.767
- Oh, my God.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.767
- I am nervous.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.500

05:22.767 --> 05:25.033
I'm so nervous for her.

She's getting cut open

05:26.066 --> 05:27.033

05:49.533 --> 05:51.633
God.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.000
There's got to be a easier way.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.567
I love cheese,

05:54.600 --> 05:57.400
like cheddar cheese,
sharp cheese,

05:57.433 --> 06:00.066
shredded cheese,
string cheese,

06:00.100 --> 06:01.767
woda, gouda,
or something like that.

Cheese in a can.

I don't know if this is gonna
work to melt the cheese.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.100
I've never done it this way.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.567
This is what this is for,
experiment.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.400
- How was your girls' night
last night?

06:14.433 --> 06:15.767

had a good time.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Raquel did
end up showing up.

06:18.033 --> 06:21.467
She doesn't really believe
that he cheated.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.000
- Why stay in something
where you just--

06:23.033 --> 06:26.400
you just get walked
all over all the time?

06:26.433 --> 06:28.633
I mean, honestly,
I think Raquel is probably

06:28.667 --> 06:30.567
the best girlfriend
for him to date.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.433
There is not one woman
that I know

06:32.467 --> 06:33.767
that would put up
with that sh--.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
- I just didn't
want her to feel

06:35.033 --> 06:36.000
like she was being attacked.

06:36.033 --> 06:37.533
- Being attacked, yeah.

06:37.567 --> 06:39.367
I mean, I knew she was
dumb as rocks before,

06:39.400 --> 06:42.000
but she's really--yep, she's--
yeah, I don't know.

06:42.033 --> 06:44.100
There's only a couple marbles
rolling around up there.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.767
That's actually
really good.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.500
- That's really good.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.667
I don't know,
maybe we can have people over.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.100
I can cook a dinner.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.633
We could have this
as a appetizer.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.767
- I'm gonna be more
of the business side of this

06:54.000 --> 06:55.400
since this is
more your thing.

06:55.433 --> 06:56.667
- I mean, we're gonna
have to Google it all

06:56.700 --> 06:58.033
and, like, figure out
how to do the permits.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.767
- Permits so that we can sell.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.400
- Yeah, like, get in.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.633
Do you go to the city?

07:06.667 --> 07:08.066
- Maybe you can just
go look and see,

07:08.100 --> 07:10.133
like, what all we need.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.567
You wanna be
the business person,

07:11.600 --> 07:13.667
then you want
to handle the business.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.433
- It's kind of late
in the day on a Friday.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.000
It's gonna be tough, but
I'll just see what I can do.

07:17.033 --> 07:18.567
I know what it takes
to run a business.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.367
What's the code to get in here,
this thing?

07:20.400 --> 07:21.734
- Your birthday.
- Oh.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.333
- I d--I mean,
after saying that,

07:27.367 --> 07:29.033
I really don't know.

07:30.467 --> 07:33.433
I don't know, but I do know,
like, kind of the basics.

07:33.467 --> 07:35.133
You have to be willing
to put in the work.

07:35.166 --> 07:39.066
How to sell food.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.500
This is hard work, hon.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.400
- This is, like, a novel.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.500
We need to get, like, a permit
for the health department.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.667
We need to have a kitchen,
like, a commercial kitchen.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.433
It's not that hard,

07:51.467 --> 07:52.700
it's just a little
time-consuming, that's all.

07:52.734 --> 07:54.400
- We definitely
gotta get all that done.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.166
- It doesn't matter if
I do it today or Sunday,

07:56.200 --> 07:57.600
plus I don't have a printer.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.133
I don't know who the hell
has a printer.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.033
- Jax has one job in this
beer cheese partnership.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.166
- Like, who knows,
next week,

08:03.200 --> 08:04.667
they're gonna
add another permit.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.767
They just make it really
difficult for people.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.467
They really do.
- Yeah.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.433
But I have a feeling
I'll probably finish

08:09.467 --> 08:11.100
the majority of the paperwork.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.700
Are you good?

08:14.066 --> 08:15.667
- Coming up...

08:15.700 --> 08:17.633
- James is mean to people
for absolutely no reason.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.166
- I don't even want to work
at a place if that's tolerated.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.533
So I went and sat down
with Lisa and I told her

08:22.567 --> 08:23.767
either he goes or I go.

08:32.233 --> 08:32.700
- ♪ Here we are,

We're waiting now to hear
from the awning company,

08:46.600 --> 08:48.467
when they can
put the awning up.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.533
- I just want to open it now.

08:49.567 --> 08:50.767
It's just gone on too long.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
- The water company
wants $167,000--

08:55.033 --> 08:56.233
- It doesn't make
any sense to me.

08:56.266 --> 08:58.433
It's ridiculous.

08:58.467 --> 09:01.734
There's so much that goes
into building a restaurant.

09:01.767 --> 09:03.700
A lot of it,
you actually can't see,

09:03.734 --> 09:05.700
and we're right at that moment

09:05.734 --> 09:07.266
where everything's
gonna change,

09:07.300 --> 09:10.667
but right now,
it looks like an empty space

09:10.700 --> 09:12.133
that needs a lot of love.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.166
- Hey, guys.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.533
- Oh, well, do come in.

09:14.567 --> 09:15.734
I'm looking
to strangle someone.

09:17.600 --> 09:22.633
- The water company want
$165,000 to connect the water.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.200
- That's outrageous.
- Outrageous.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.567
- That's insane.

You hate me. You hate me.
You hate--you hate--hate me.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.433

important enough to hate.

18:26.467 --> 18:27.533
Sit down.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.734
- I always freakin' lose.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.266
- I brought my planner.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.667
- Yes, I'm so excited.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.467
- On its birthday.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.533
I have to show you.

18:39.166 --> 18:40.633
- Yes.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.533
- Holy sh--.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.633
- Okay, so...

18:45.667 --> 18:47.633
- First of all, our theme
is the ----ing best.

18:47.667 --> 18:51.200
- It is the best because no one
ever does winter in summer.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.266
- Winter is here.
- Yes.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.233

that Kristen found is, like--

18:56.500 --> 18:58.333

- Super sick.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.600

can be Christmasy.

19:01.667 --> 19:04.233
Like, any type.
- Icy, Christmasy,

19:04.266 --> 19:05.667
Hanukkah, I mean, whatever.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.567
- Should we have
a Christmas tree?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.166
- There's no such thing
as too much.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.000
- Yes, no such thing.

19:11.033 --> 19:14.233

throwing a joint birthday party

19:14.266 --> 19:18.300

I didn't really like.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.700
I don't understand
what you're doing.

19:19.734 --> 19:21.166
- Because I care about Katie.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.433
I don't give a
about you.

19:23.467 --> 19:28.200

that she's pretty bratty,

19:32.400 --> 19:34.233

and I are cool,

19:34.266 --> 19:38.000

this amazing birthday blowout

19:38.033 --> 19:39.467

be nice to me?

19:50.333 --> 19:52.033

see the good in me?

19:52.066 --> 19:54.500

the boss of everybody.

I was here on Pride,

26:05.667 --> 26:07.166

26:07.200 --> 26:10.233

- Are you cool if I take
a little bit of a break?

28:02.266 --> 28:04.400
- Yeah, you're fine, go.
- Okay.

28:14.467 --> 28:18.066
That's intense in there.

28:18.100 --> 28:22.133
So I wanted to talk to you
about a few things.

28:22.166 --> 28:26.467
First, at Pride,
I was absolutely not okay

28:26.500 --> 28:30.367
with you saying to me,
"You claim to support women."

28:30.400 --> 28:32.367
I can't support someone

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
when you don't even
support yourself.

28:34.433 --> 28:37.133
That being said, I know
people are coming at you

28:37.166 --> 28:39.367
from all angles telling you
that your man creeps around.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.367
That's, like,
a known fact, okay?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.367
I watched him do it
in front of me.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.767
You're the only person,
Raquel, that doesn't see it.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.266
Like, I--I hate
that I called you dumb,

28:49.300 --> 28:51.133
but what else do you
want me to call you?

28:51.166 --> 28:52.333
What's going on
in front of you--

28:52.367 --> 28:53.500
- I'm not dumb,
first of all.

28:53.533 --> 28:56.333
I just graduated
with my degree.

28:56.367 --> 29:00.133
- I graduated
from college, Lala.

29:00.166 --> 29:02.734
A lot of people graduate
with their degree, Raquel.

29:02.767 --> 29:06.400
Raquel literally has the girl
that James ----ed in front

29:06.433 --> 29:10.266
of her saying, "I hooked
up with your man at this time.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.467
This is what we did before,"
and Raquel is sitting there

29:12.500 --> 29:15.333
like, "I just need
more evidence."

29:15.367 --> 29:16.767
Your man is
not Johnny Depp.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.467
People don't just say
that they ----ed him.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.333
Like, you're the only person

29:20.367 --> 29:22.734
that's not embarrassed that
they ----ed him, to be honest.

29:22.767 --> 29:25.133
- No, I am embarrassed,
I am.

29:25.166 --> 29:28.000
- I do nothing
but support other women.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.200
I'm telling you right now,

29:29.233 --> 29:31.066
girl, you're trudging
in deep waters.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.166
- See, here we go.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.400
- This is what
I'm talking about.

29:33.433 --> 29:34.400
- This is what
I'm talking about.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.000
- Wake up, wake up.

29:36.033 --> 29:38.066
- Lala, stop clapping
in my face.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.500
It's not cute.
- Oh, my God.

29:39.533 --> 29:41.333
- If I saw
someone struggling...

29:41.367 --> 29:43.000
- You've never told me
that you're struggling.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.400
- Then I would want
to help that person

29:44.433 --> 29:46.734
and build them up
instead of tear them down

29:46.767 --> 29:50.066
like you and Logan
did countless times.

29:50.100 --> 29:53.033
Just have fun together
being BFFs

29:53.066 --> 29:55.233
and talking sh--
behind my back.

29:55.266 --> 30:00.033
"Oh, my God,
she is so ----ing dumb."

30:00.066 --> 30:02.300
- You're bonding over
talking sh-- about James.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.467

over the fact

30:03.500 --> 30:06.066
that my dad died,
you ----ing twat.

30:08.033 --> 30:09.300
- Stupid.

30:09.333 --> 30:11.367
This whole conversation
has nothing to do

30:11.400 --> 30:13.333
with your dad passing away.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.433
- Get away from me.
Get away from me.

30:16.467 --> 30:19.400
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

30:19.433 --> 30:21.200

30:21.233 --> 30:24.100
She heard one thing
that she didn't like,

30:24.133 --> 30:26.300

the dad card.

Let's go outside.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.533

We're gonna go.

Tell Diana I'm gonna
pop out, like, stat.
