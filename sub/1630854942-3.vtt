I love you, Billie.

I love you too.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.101
Hello, <i>khoshgelam.</i>

03:05.101 --> 03:09.397
- I've been thinking about you all morning.
- Yeah? What kind of thoughts?

03:09.397 --> 03:15.445
Oh, very, very good ones,
and some very bad ones too.

03:15.445 --> 03:20.783
I swear the days you're in Connecticut
are the longest three days of my life.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.744
I'm back tonight,

03:22.744 --> 03:25.371
and I can't wait to see you
at the holiday party.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.708
<i>You better have
some of that babaganoush waiting for me.</i>

03:29.375 --> 03:33.296
Yes, ma'am.
But you sure you're gonna be okay coming?

03:34.213 --> 03:36.966
I know it might be weird for you
with Brad and Gigi there.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.719
Oh, I'll be fine.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.348
I mean, I actually haven't even
thought about him in a while.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.602
Besides, I'll have my girl Sasha,
so it'll all be good.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.646
And you'll have me.

03:53.149 --> 03:59.239
Okay, I have to get the kids ready,
so I will see you tonight, <i>azizam.</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:01.699
Until then, <i>eshghe man.</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:36.734
Okay. Ha.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.404
Oh. Whoo!

04:39.404 --> 04:43.032
She's back.
Thought we lost you to cyberspace forever.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.576
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:45.576 --> 04:49.789
You know social's a big part of my brand,
especially if I want a huge turnout today.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.001
I've never headlined anything this major.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.252
I know...

04:54.252 --> 04:57.505
today is not exactly about the male gaze,

04:57.505 --> 05:00.508
but I do love watching you
in your element.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.886
I was hoping I could come with.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.852
Um, I don't know.
It's kind of a girl thing.

05:10.852 --> 05:15.231
You know, lots of sugar scrubs,
jade eggs, vibrator necklaces.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.192
I love vibrator necklaces.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.030
But you know what I love even more?
Being a part of your life.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.825
- All the way.
- Kam.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.538
I know you're all about setting boundaries
and carving out independence,

05:30.538 --> 05:33.583
but I feel like I've been a part of this.

05:33.583 --> 05:39.213
You have, and it's been really wonderful
and really fucking weird all at once.

05:42.258 --> 05:46.804
Okay, real talk. After I made the decision
not to go to California with you,

05:46.804 --> 05:49.932
I organized my life in
a very specific way.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.518
I've always felt
having a partner would limit me.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.563
But...

05:58.024 --> 05:59.567
these last three months...

06:01.694 --> 06:05.198
I don't know, I've felt sustained by it.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.283
Good.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.119
That's what I want.

06:10.119 --> 06:14.207
See, I can be the Stedman to your Oprah.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.210
Boy, you are definitely
the Jay-Z to my Beyoncé.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.128
Then let me come with you today.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.840
I don't want to hear
about your latest triumph

06:22.840 --> 06:25.426
over a glass of wine
at the end of the day.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.345
I wanna be there, babe.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.098
Hashtag, "IRL."

06:31.974 --> 06:36.270
Besides, I am really good at girl things.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.772
Want me to show you?

06:38.272 --> 06:39.482
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.399
Okay.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.944
- Let me show you.
- Okay.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.292
You almost there?
My jaw is starting to lock.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.254
Maybe you can try
using a little less teeth.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.214
You know what? Forget it.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.217
Wake up, dude.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.719
A lot of guys love my blowjobs.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.889
Slut.

07:12.849 --> 07:13.891
I heard that.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.977
Yeah? Well, I heard you.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.395
That's a first.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.777
Okay, honey.

07:25.987 --> 07:30.199
I'm gonna see you in three sleeps.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.701
That's a long time.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.871
I know,
but you can FaceTime me whenever you want.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.038
You know that.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.459
What do you do
when you're not here with me and Ellary?

07:40.501 --> 07:44.505
Well, I go to school, just like you.

07:45.423 --> 07:50.928
I do my homework, I teach classes,
and then sometimes I see Auntie Sasha.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.348
Do you have a friend
like Daddy has Francesca?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.644
You know Francesca?

07:58.644 --> 08:01.063
She came for dinner. We made cookies.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.359
So Francesca's been to the house.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.195
She brought me Waddles.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.740
- Waddles?
- My penguin.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.416
- Billie? What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jill. I just need to talk to Cooper.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.710
But Cooper doesn't work here anymore.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.254
What are you talking about?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.549
He hasn't worked here for months.
Didn't he tell you?

08:30.927 --> 08:33.012
No, he didn't.

08:33.012 --> 08:34.013
Ah.

08:34.680 --> 08:38.935
Well, he made quite an exit.
Everyone's still talking about it.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.896
I think he's working
for Morgan Stanley now.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.774
Excuse me.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.958
If it ain't the Wolf of Wall Street.

09:01.958 --> 09:05.336
- Yo! Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No, it's all good.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.129
Your assistant got me a matcha latte.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.757
Can't believe
you guys have an in-house barista.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.593
All they give us at Frugal Sky
are shitty poppy seed bagels.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.720
How are things over at Do-Gooder, Inc.?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.973
A lot better
since slamming the receptionist.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.140
Jill?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.017
Jill!

09:20.893 --> 09:22.228
Fuck.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.022
I always say Jane,
but you're right, it's Jill.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.649
- Dev.
- I know.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.609
I know, you and Francesca,

09:28.609 --> 09:31.237
but fuck cautionary tales
because it's Christmas,

09:31.237 --> 09:35.533
and Jill is the perfect stocking stuffer
to cure my holiday blue balls.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.827
- Does Trina know?
- I don't know, probably.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.289
Trina's a lot of things,
but she ain't dumb. What about you?

09:41.289 --> 09:44.166
You and Franny
still riding off into the sunset together?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.670
Yeah. Yeah, things are good.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.756
So where are you taking me to lunch?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.262
Nice try, but you're the one
with the company black card,

09:56.262 --> 09:58.264
so I'm thinking we hit Masa.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.183
All right.
I could go for a little omakase.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.479
Oh, shit.

10:07.481 --> 10:10.651
I'm sorry, Dev. I gotta take a rain check.
It's a Billie thing.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.653
Hey, crazy never sleeps, right?

10:12.653 --> 10:13.779
Tell me about it.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.115
I'll talk to you.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.836
As you can see on my résumé,
I was here for eight years.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.214
Ed Fredlich
promoted me to Junior VP at 24,

10:32.214 --> 10:35.217
making me the youngest exec
to lead my own team at the time.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.012
Oh, you knew Ed Fredlich?

10:38.012 --> 10:41.766
Yes, he was my mentor.
The two of us signed Dove together.

10:41.766 --> 10:47.605
Well, Ed's a legend around here,
but when was that?

10:48.773 --> 10:49.982
2008.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.319
Oh, my God.
That was the year I got my braces.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.237
Middle school can be so brutal, right?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.489
Oh. Tell me about it.

10:56.489 --> 11:00.242
My daughter just started, and her moods...
I'd forgotten all about that.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.745
Your daughter's in middle school?

11:04.955 --> 11:07.875
I took some time off to raise my kids,

11:08.709 --> 11:12.338
but that experience
has given me new perspective,

11:12.338 --> 11:15.549
especially on how to appeal
to the burgeoning mommy market.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.428
And considering 80% of your clients
cater to those consumers,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.806
that knowledge could be a real asset.

11:22.640 --> 11:27.269
- What's your social media presence like?
- I have over 1000 Facebook friends.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.692
You sound just like my mom.
She's really into Facebook too.

11:33.692 --> 11:37.905
No, I meant Instagram, TikTok, Twitter.
Are you familiar with Peanut?

11:39.949 --> 11:43.702
The landscape's changed
quite significantly since you worked here.

11:43.702 --> 11:47.790
No one watches commercials.
It's all about Twitch and Clubhouse.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.917
I pick things up very quickly.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.627
I'm sure you do.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.881
Thank you so much for coming in.
Let me give this a thought.

11:57.591 --> 12:01.262
- Would you like a list of my references?
- That's not necessary.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.557
It was really nice meeting you.
A real history lesson.

12:11.689 --> 12:17.027
<i>♪ Everyone says, "Follow the rules
Do what we do, don't make a scene..." ♪</i>

12:18.654 --> 12:22.366
Whoa. I have never seen
so many vibrators in my life.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.244
Sasha!
Sangita Patel from <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

12:25.244 --> 12:26.620
Can I have a few words?

12:26.620 --> 12:29.165
Uh, yeah, of course!

12:30.499 --> 12:32.334
Go on now, give me your coat.

12:33.752 --> 12:39.133
I'm here with Sasha Snow, the mastermind
behind today's uber-empowering event,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.594
Independent Woman 4 Life.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.387
You must be thrilled by the turnout.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.764
Thank you, Sangita. We are.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.602
Especially because
20% of today's proceeds will go towards

12:49.602 --> 12:52.855
micro-financing female entrepreneurs
in developing countries,

12:52.855 --> 12:56.275
so we're hoping to sell a lot of T-shirts.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.737
Fabulous! But if you don't mind,
I'd like to talk about you.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.698
Oh, honey, I never mind.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.241
What do you wanna know?

13:04.241 --> 13:07.411
Three months ago,
you were a best-selling author,

13:07.411 --> 13:09.371
but still relatively unknown.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.582
Now you're practically a household name,

13:11.582 --> 13:15.169
leading the charge
for smart young women everywhere.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.962
What's your secret?

13:17.546 --> 13:20.674
- Well, I have a really great agent.
- Of course.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.429
But also...

13:27.056 --> 13:28.974
I have a really great boyfriend.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.144
You have a boyfriend?

13:32.144 --> 13:36.565
Can you tell our viewers anything
about this lucky mystery man?

13:36.565 --> 13:39.527
I'll do you one better. Kam.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.153
- Oh, no, no.
-  Come here.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.198
- Come on, don't be shy.
-  Okay, all right.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.117
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.578
This is Dr. Kamani Evans.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.289
He provides medical disaster relief
all over the world

13:52.289 --> 13:55.000
through his non-profit First Do No Harm.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.211
So nice to meet you.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.088
The pleasure's all mine.

13:59.088 --> 14:03.217
A charming doctor that looks like that?
Hell of a secret weapon.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.927
What does this mean for the future?

14:04.927 --> 14:08.430
Will upcoming books
be written by Sasha Evans?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.268
Girl, please.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.438
If anything, he'll be treating patients
as Dr. Kamani Snow.

14:17.773 --> 14:22.403
So tell me, are you able
to be unapologetically sexual,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.780
as you call it in the book,
with Dr. Kamani?

14:24.780 --> 14:26.490
Oh, absolutely.

14:26.490 --> 14:30.077
You know, Kam was actually my first.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.663
Talk about coming full circle.

14:32.663 --> 14:37.167
Oh, I got your full circle.
This man knows how to work my situation.

14:37.167 --> 14:40.421
Now, there's a visual
I'll be taking to bed tonight.

14:40.421 --> 14:44.049
Then take this. He does this thing,
it's called the butter churner.

14:44.049 --> 14:48.846
- He lifts my legs, stands in front of me--
- Okay, I think that's enough.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.347
Tell me more!

14:50.347 --> 14:55.603
No, seriously, I'm telling you,
the butter churner will change your life.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.479
I'll do a post about it. Check for it.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.566
Okay, maybe we should talk more
about microfinancing. Anybody?

15:00.566 --> 15:03.319
You two are so adorable.
Thank you so much!

15:03.319 --> 15:04.486
Thank you.

15:04.486 --> 15:10.200
Merry Christmas!
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

15:11.243 --> 15:13.162
So you won't even meet me indoors now?

15:14.038 --> 15:16.874
Hmm. Oh, I don't know.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.877
Just feels safer to have witnesses.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.630
You quit Blue Sky without even telling me.

15:22.630 --> 15:26.884
Whoops. Sorry, Mom. Guess I forgot
to have my permission slip signed.

15:26.884 --> 15:30.638
Oh, Jesus, Cooper.
And now you're back with the evil empire?

15:30.638 --> 15:33.349
Whatever happened
to working for principles?

15:33.349 --> 15:35.267
You called me to talk about morality?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.437
If that's the case,
it will be a short conversation.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.898
Okay, all right.
I called to talk about Francesca.

15:41.523 --> 15:45.110
- Are you two dating now?
- I don't think that's your business.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.238
It is when you're
introducing her to our kids.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.659
I assumed we would
discuss something like that first.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.495
Well, you assumed wrong again.

15:55.996 --> 16:01.752
Cooper, I have been trying so hard
to do things the right way

16:01.752 --> 16:03.587
for the sake of our kids.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.631
Then you have nothing to worry about.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.426
Francesca's amazing
with Hudson and Ellary.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.305
Does she spend the night
when she visits the house?

16:13.305 --> 16:17.059
No. But I do spend the night
at her place when I'm in the city.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.312
You told the lawyers
you were staying with your brother.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.273
Please. As if this is any different
from your arrangement.

16:23.273 --> 16:26.902
An empty apartment, which,
let's be honest, is just a PO box,

16:26.902 --> 16:28.904
while you shack up with Brad.

16:28.904 --> 16:33.367
Cooper, no. Brad and I are not together.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.577
Oh, no. No, of course not.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.539
No, he's having a baby with someone else.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.874
We've both moved on.

16:44.128 --> 16:48.841
Oh, Cooper.
I told you this was never about Brad.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.677
Which means...

16:56.515 --> 16:58.100
that this is about me.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.606
Got it.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.276
Cooper, wait.

17:10.404 --> 17:15.826
You should have seen him, Sash.
It was like his whole world split open.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.580
And I tried telling him all along
that this wasn't about Brad,

17:19.580 --> 17:21.331
but he wouldn't listen.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.959
He was just so angry.

17:24.501 --> 17:31.258
But today I saw how much pain there was
underneath all that anger.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.096
I'm worried about him, Sash.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.766
Cooper's a rich, handsome white guy
in Manhattan, okay?

17:38.766 --> 17:42.311
- He's gonna be fine.
- I'm not so sure he is.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.563
It's not your sink, not your dishes.

17:45.522 --> 17:49.151
- Cooper's not your husband anymore.
- We were together for nine years, Sasha.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
He's the father of my children.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.115
And he will continue
to be best dad ever to those kids.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.786
But for you, he's in the past.

17:59.745 --> 18:04.249
Majid is your future, and he is amazing.

18:04.249 --> 18:09.421
I mean, not Kam amazing,
but still pretty fucking great.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.673
- Pretty fucking great. Yeah.

18:26.563 --> 18:27.606
Trina.

18:29.399 --> 18:33.153
- Cooper.
- Hey. What are you doing in the city, huh?

18:33.987 --> 18:35.030
Big shopping day?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.950
More like retail therapy.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.870
Ugh. Sounds like you had
as crappy a day as I did.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.416
I actually had a meeting
about getting my old job back.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.669
Oh, no kidding? How'd that go?

18:48.669 --> 18:50.629
When it was over, I ran to Bergdorf's

18:50.629 --> 18:53.173
and dropped four grand
on a studded McQueen knuckle clutch,

18:53.173 --> 18:55.592
so super practical.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.806
All they want are 20-something influencers
with mega followers.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.725
- Ugh. What a world, huh?
- Yeah.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.104
Do you have a Twitch?

19:09.231 --> 19:11.608
Do I--? No.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.571
Does it look like I do? Because my eye
will flutter sometimes when I'm tired.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.490
- It's a streaming platform.
- Oh, God.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.951
At least I'm not the last person
to hear about it.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.290
Well, this is me.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.795
Please don't say anything to Devon.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.798
I didn't even tell him
I was going for the interview.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.342
I'm invisible enough at home.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.720
I don't wanna give him
more excuses to dismiss me.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.471
No, no, no, of course not.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
But I think it's great
you're putting yourself out there.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.688
They'd be lucky to have you.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.275
I remember when we first met,

19:53.275 --> 19:55.944
you were absolutely crushing it
in the ad world.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.572
I'm glad someone remembers that person.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.370
Well, get home safe, okay?

20:08.165 --> 20:08.999
Cooper.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.630
Do you ever think about that night?

20:15.505 --> 20:16.757
At the party.

20:23.430 --> 20:28.185
Yeah. I think about it all the time.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.228
Me too.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.820
- What time do your kids go to bed?
- Nine o'clock. Why?

20:39.655 --> 20:42.366
Think maybe you could sneak out
without getting noticed?

20:45.619 --> 20:52.626
<i>♪ I won't be home for Christmas
Darling, not this year ♪</i>

20:53.335 --> 20:56.838
<i>♪ The trains have all stopped

20:56.838 --> 21:00.300
<i>♪ The snow's up to our ears... ♪</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:04.221
Holy holiday party!

21:04.221 --> 21:05.305
Right?

21:07.808 --> 21:10.727
They're serving 1942 at the open bar?

21:10.727 --> 21:16.525
Oh, yo. Don't mess this up, Billie,
because your boy Majid's a keeper.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.027
So I guess we're starting with tequila.

21:19.027 --> 21:21.738
Mm!

21:23.448 --> 21:24.533
Bills, you want?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.827
I'll catch you guys later.

21:26.827 --> 21:30.372
I'm go gonna find Majid <i>joon,</i>
my sexy boyfriend.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.832
Have fun.

21:51.435 --> 21:56.231
There's my babies. Hi, Ells!

21:56.940 --> 21:59.985
- Hi, Daddy.
- How are you, buddy? I missed you.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.695
Hi, Cooper.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.573
Olga. Hi.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.787
How would you like to
take the night off tonight?

22:12.164 --> 22:14.916
What are you talking about? No, I'm fine.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.961
Oh, please.
You have been working non-stop lately,

22:17.961 --> 22:21.173
and you deserve this,
so here, I insist, all right?

22:21.173 --> 22:26.011
I want you to go get yourself
a nice dinner, go see a movie.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.558
I suppose I could go
and see my sister's new condo.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.268
She's been asking me to stay over.

22:33.268 --> 22:38.065
Yeah, I think that's a fantastic idea,
so I'm gonna just take that, all right?

22:38.065 --> 22:40.609
And why don't you go get ready?

22:48.658 --> 22:51.828
All right, kiddos, who's ready for PJs?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.873
Ells, yes? Hudson, yeah? Huh?

23:01.004 --> 23:04.341
- Billie? Hey. Look what I have.
- Oh.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.305
Who was that woman?

23:10.305 --> 23:11.348
What woman?

23:12.265 --> 23:15.685
The Kim Cattrall look-a-like
that was nuzzled up to your neck,

23:15.685 --> 23:17.479
trying to, what, guess your cologne?

23:17.479 --> 23:19.940
That's just Crystal.
She's one of our investors.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.067
She seemed pretty invested in you.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.278
She's just tipsy.
She acts that way with everyone.

23:25.278 --> 23:28.115
Besides, I'm in the restaurant business.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.535
Pretending to flirt with the ladies
is part of the gig.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.622
Sorry to interrupt.
Mind if I steal Billie for a sec?

23:36.998 --> 23:39.918
- You owe me a dance later. Okay?
- Okay, all right.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.130
What's going on?

23:43.630 --> 23:45.549
I wanted to give you a heads up.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.345
I just saw Brad and Gigi, and they are...

23:57.602 --> 23:58.520
...married.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.899
<i>♪ We'll be happier ♪</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:06.778
<i>♪ Than we have... ♪</i>

24:10.782 --> 24:13.827
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Do you wanna get out of here?

24:13.827 --> 24:16.997
I don't get it. I thought I'd be fine.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.666
I am in love with Majid.

24:19.666 --> 24:23.253
I mean, I haven't even thought
about Brad in months, but...

24:24.796 --> 24:26.214
He's married?

24:27.674 --> 24:28.592
I know.

24:29.259 --> 24:32.012
I keep trying to do what you say
and live in the future,

24:32.012 --> 24:34.890
but the past just keeps
kicking me in the ass.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.726
- They're headed this way.
- Okay.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.811
- You want me to stay?
- I'm fine. It's okay.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.813
I've got my big girl panties on.
It's okay.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.648
- I'll be there if you need me.
- Okay.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.649
You got this.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.986
- Billie, hi! It's so good to see you.
- Hi.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.572
- You remember Gigi?
- Yes, of course.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.033
And I just heard the news. Congrats.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.034
Thank you.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.828
It was the best weekend I've ever had.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.914
We snuck away to Playa del Carmen.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.041
It was very intimate, family only.

25:01.041 --> 25:05.670
Well, it was supposed to be until he flew
my best friends out to surprise me.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.214
But the biggest surprise of all,

25:07.214 --> 25:11.092
he got Enrique Iglesias
to serenade us on our first dance.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.220
- How amazing is that?
- Enrique? Wow!

25:13.220 --> 25:16.723
He was in Cancun on vacation
with his family, anyway, so...

25:16.723 --> 25:18.516
Brad's so modest.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.810
He really pulled out all the stops.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.896
The only thing you didn't do
was get a haircut.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.023
- Oh.
- But he did shave.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.652
Oh, my gosh. Is that Natalia?

25:29.194 --> 25:31.988
Would you excuse me? I haven't seen her
since we were Angels together.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.907
We walked the show in Shanghai.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.034
Excuse me.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.079
Angels, as in...?

25:39.079 --> 25:40.997
Victoria's Secret, yeah.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.250
So that's...

25:44.334 --> 25:46.002
your wife.

25:47.629 --> 25:51.841
Yeah. I thought about reaching out
to let you know, but--

25:51.841 --> 25:53.385
Oh, why would you?

25:55.595 --> 25:58.390
This is a good thing, you know. Um...

25:59.057 --> 25:59.975
For you.

26:01.685 --> 26:02.811
For your baby.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.653
I'm so sorry, Billie.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.824
For what?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.201
Picking her?

26:28.670 --> 26:31.423
- Billie, I--
- No, don't. Don't.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.553
I can't.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.490
We can have the life
we always should have had.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.992
It's not too late.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.786
I'm telling you, B. I've got you.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.288
This can be real.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.171
Billie. Hi.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.965
I swear I have to pee every 30 minutes.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.010
This baby is using my bladder
as a punching bag.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.347
Yes, I-- I remember those days. Yeah.

27:20.347 --> 27:24.267
I'm glad I ran into you.
I was hoping we'd get the chance to talk.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.727
About what?

27:26.269 --> 27:28.396
None of my other friends have kids yet,

27:28.396 --> 27:30.357
and I have been dying to get some advice

27:30.357 --> 27:32.525
from someone
who's been through it all before.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.778
Brad says you're an amazing mother.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.155
- He told you that?
- He did.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.325
Anyway, sorry to just
put it all out there,

27:40.325 --> 27:41.785
but did you breastfeed?

27:42.827 --> 27:45.830
Yes. Yes, I did. I did. I, um--

27:45.830 --> 27:48.583
I breastfed both of my kids.

27:48.583 --> 27:51.127
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Yeah.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.589
See, I really want to,
but my mom says it ruins your boobs

27:54.589 --> 27:57.050
and that pump thing looks frightening.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.845
Well, I mean,
you get used to it, you know.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.641
Besides, if you want a night off,
let alone to go back to work,

28:04.641 --> 28:08.603
then that thing is gonna become...
your breast friend.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.272
Good to know.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.192
Yeah. Brad is set on nursing.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.987
- He's reading this book on the benefits--
- Of breastfeeding?

28:17.987 --> 28:20.949
I know, right?
He's been reading all the parenting books.

28:20.949 --> 28:24.285
Brad! Who would have thought?

28:24.285 --> 28:26.579
He wants to do this thing
called the family bed.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.998
Yeah, yeah.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.835
- Yeah, where he wants our son to sleep--
- Oh, um...

28:32.544 --> 28:34.546
It's a boy?

28:35.630 --> 28:36.798
Brad's ecstatic.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.510
He said he didn't care either way,
but I know he wanted a son.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.763
Anyway, he wants us
to all sleep in the big bed

28:43.763 --> 28:46.558
to maximize skin-to-skin contact,
which is so sweet, really,

28:46.558 --> 28:49.602
but I've just heard it's so important
to get the baby in his crib

28:49.602 --> 28:52.939
as early as possible if there's any hope
of having a post-baby sex life.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.733
You know what? Just stop. Um...

28:55.608 --> 28:59.946
Honestly, we could debate this forever,
but I'll just tell you this,

28:59.946 --> 29:03.241
co-sleeping, at least at first,
makes nighttime feedings easier,

29:03.241 --> 29:06.828
but then eventually,
you'll want to get the baby into...

29:07.996 --> 29:12.083
his own crib, because you'll want
that time for yourself...

29:14.169 --> 29:15.420
and for your husband.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.798
- Billie, wait.
- I'm sorry, I just, uh--

29:20.341 --> 29:21.634
I need to go find Majid.

30:16.564 --> 30:17.524
You came.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.734
Well, not yet.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.153
But hopefully, very soon.

30:31.037 --> 30:34.082
Can I get you a glass of wine, or...?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.542
Um...

30:36.709 --> 30:38.044
Okay, then.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.108
- Shh.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.777
Sorry.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.118
Hey. Come with me.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.035
Okay.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.170
That's Billie's?

31:29.554 --> 31:30.763
Billie's not here.

31:32.849 --> 31:33.683
We are.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.278
Mm.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.989
Now that is an outfit.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.742
Did you pick that up at Bergdorf's too?

31:52.994 --> 31:56.122
Wait till you see what else
I've got in store for you.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.085
This is your lucky night, Cooper Connelly.

32:06.758 --> 32:11.012
- You've been a very naughty boy.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.264
- I have been, haven't I?
- Mm.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.100
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

32:26.653 --> 32:28.321
Is this what you want?

32:28.947 --> 32:29.989
Yes.

32:31.991 --> 32:32.992
Beg me.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.536
Oh...

32:36.496 --> 32:41.000
Please, please, please.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.377
-  Daddy?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.880
Hudson, get out of here!

32:48.800 --> 32:49.634
Shit!

32:53.096 --> 32:56.557
<i>♪ You're not leaving here tonight ♪</i>

32:56.557 --> 32:59.227
<i>♪ We're tucked in safe and tight ♪</i>

32:59.227 --> 33:02.105
<i>♪ Our fire has a little bit of life... ♪</i>

33:02.105 --> 33:03.773
Hey. I'm so sorry.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.192
Have you guys seen Majid?
I can't find him anywhere.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.112
Are you okay? How'd it go with Brad?

33:09.737 --> 33:11.531
- I can't even think about it.
-  Uh-oh.

33:11.531 --> 33:15.034
Do I need to kick some Aussie ass?
Slash some motorcycle tires?

33:15.034 --> 33:16.911
It was fucking awful.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.580
- I'll get us drinks.
- Thank you.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.795
He said he was sorry,
which was humiliating.

33:25.795 --> 33:29.590
And then his wife cornered me
with questions about motherhood,

33:29.590 --> 33:31.759
like I'm the freaking La Leche League.

33:31.759 --> 33:34.137
- I could not hate her more.
- No.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.222
That's the worst part.

33:36.222 --> 33:38.349
She's so nice.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.309
She's way too nice to be friends with us.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.438
And, apparently,
Brad has become super dad,

33:43.438 --> 33:46.482
doing all the things we were
supposed to do when we were together,

33:46.482 --> 33:49.360
as if I was the trial run,
then he got it all right with her.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.280
I just really need
to find my fucking boyfriend.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.115
Okay, we will find him.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.284
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:56.284 --> 33:59.454
No. You go find Kam, okay?

33:59.454 --> 34:00.788
Enjoy your evening.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.957
- I'm gonna be fine, okay?
- Oh, okay.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.168
- Hi, Clare. Have you seen Majid?
- Hi.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.587
I haven't. Maybe try the office?

34:07.587 --> 34:08.671
Oh, yes.

34:12.341 --> 34:14.302
-  Crystal.
- Oh, my God.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.386
Oh, shit.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.847
Is this part of the restaurant biz too?

34:17.847 --> 34:19.223
Just let me explain.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.308
Go to hell.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.603
Billie! Wait!

34:23.603 --> 34:26.731
- No.
- Please, just hear me out.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.192
I trusted you. You said you loved me.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.610
I do love you.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.196
This thing with Crystal, it's complicated.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.615
You think my life isn't complicated?

34:35.615 --> 34:38.076
I told you everything about my marriage,

34:38.076 --> 34:40.369
about the mistakes that I made,

34:40.369 --> 34:42.246
- about Brad.
- I know.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.124
I didn't want any secrets
this time around,

34:45.124 --> 34:47.877
so you need to be
honest with me right now.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.048
Can we please
just go back inside and talk?

34:55.343 --> 34:56.761
- Hudson.
-  <i>Mommy!</i>

34:56.761 --> 35:00.056
Hey, honey. Hey.
What's going on? Are you okay?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.641
<i>Daddy yelled at me.</i>

35:01.641 --> 35:04.519
Okay, what are you talking about?

35:04.519 --> 35:07.146
- Why are you still awake?
<i>- Daddy was stuck on the bed,</i>

35:07.146 --> 35:09.440
<i>and Trina was there,
and she wasn't wearing any--</i>

35:09.440 --> 35:11.442
- Oh, my God.
-  <i>Hudson! What are you doing?</i>

35:11.442 --> 35:13.778
-  Cooper, what is going on?
-  <i>I want Mommy!</i>

35:13.778 --> 35:15.113
<i>I got it handled, Billie. Okay?</i>

35:15.113 --> 35:16.656
<i>- It's my night.
- I want Mommy!</i>

35:17.740 --> 35:19.700
Billie. Please.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.537
I can't deal with you
or any of this right now.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.746
I need to go see my son.

35:23.746 --> 35:28.167
- I can drive you.
- Right. Because that's not complicated.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.262
Fuck!

35:41.889 --> 35:42.849
Hey, Sash.

35:45.601 --> 35:50.940
Brad Simon. Trouble from Down Under.
Have you seen Billie?

35:51.482 --> 35:54.902
No, is she okay? We talked earlier.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.238
I'm sure she's fine.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.616
Probably cozied up in a corner with Majid.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.829
Hey, congrats on your big news.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.707
Never thought I'd see the day.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.543
You're finally gonna be a dad.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.711
Yeah, it's, uh...

36:12.753 --> 36:14.839
It's all happening really fast.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.760
I just hope you know what you're doing.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.222
For everyone's sake.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.065
Any sign of her?

36:33.065 --> 36:34.609
No, I looked everywhere.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.112
Well, maybe she left with Majid.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.948
I do hope she's all right.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.996
You're such a good boyfriend.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.207
Well...

36:50.917 --> 36:52.001
I love you.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.379
So I better be.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.343
I love you too.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.856
Sorry, I gotta take this.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.026
Let me guess. Mick?

37:20.488 --> 37:22.782
Mick. Hey, what's up?

37:22.782 --> 37:26.869
Not your Q score, that's for damn sure.
Have you seen Twitter?

37:26.869 --> 37:29.330
Uh, no, why? What's wrong?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.332
Open it the fuck right now.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.131
Oh, fuck.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.677
"Oh, fuck" is right, Miss Dependent.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.346
We need to turn this shit around fast.

37:45.346 --> 37:48.391
I don't know who this guy is,
but he's killing your brand.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.412
Billie, you don't need to be here.
I told you, I've got this.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.289
Are you kidding me right now?

38:11.289 --> 38:12.957
What the hell were you thinking?

38:12.957 --> 38:16.419
With Trina, in our house,
in front of our son?

38:16.419 --> 38:17.545
Mommy!

38:19.088 --> 38:20.256
Hudson!

38:21.299 --> 38:22.258
Hi.

38:22.258 --> 38:25.636
Let's go to bed. Oh, my big boy!

38:41.569 --> 38:44.905
You've been staring at that thing
for two days straight.

38:44.905 --> 38:47.074
You're gonna go cross-eyed, you know that?

38:48.200 --> 38:50.328
I just can't believe it's real.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.249
But you're right.
I should probably throw this away.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.335
Ah-ah-ah. Not a chance.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.046
I'm gonna get this thing framed. Yeah.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.507
That's what I'm gonna do.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.180
Honey. Are you okay?

39:10.389 --> 39:12.808
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Just--

39:13.351 --> 39:16.562
Just all holiday-partied out, that's all.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.023
I'm good.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.568
I'm not sure that's it.

39:24.695 --> 39:28.032
I think tonight was harder for Billie
than you said it would be.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.577
And I think it was harder for you too.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.831
No, Gigi, look, I told you.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.794
What Billie and I had,

39:41.045 --> 39:42.254
it's in the past.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.594
You are my wife.

39:52.598 --> 39:54.433
You're the mother of my son.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.021
And I am so damn happy

39:59.021 --> 40:01.649
I get to spend
the rest of my life with you.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.152
Are you sure?

40:08.656 --> 40:11.242
Because I know a way to make you sure.

40:13.869 --> 40:17.289
To make sure that I am the only woman
on your mind.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.454
Cooper?

41:03.961 --> 41:05.045
Hudson's asleep.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.972
Look, I know I messed up. I--

41:14.972 --> 41:16.807
Cooper, just tell me what's going on.

41:18.684 --> 41:22.730
I-- I know you're hurting,
but Trina's your best friend's wife.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.315
And what about Francesca?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.774
I don't-- I don't know.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.277
Okay? I don't know what I'm doing.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.198
I thought Francesca was the answer, but...

41:37.495 --> 41:39.288
It's like there's this...

41:40.331 --> 41:42.208
this emptiness, there's this...

41:43.542 --> 41:46.504
this void inside me
that I'm trying to fill.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.131
Maybe I'm trying to fuck my troubles away.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.510
Nothing feels right.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.264
I just miss you, Billie.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.682
I miss us...

41:59.767 --> 42:03.062
together in this house with our family.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.609
Oh, Cooper.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.698
I am so sorry...

42:16.992 --> 42:19.036
for so many things.

42:21.664 --> 42:25.751
But I am especially sorry for hurting you.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.422
I really do want us to work through this.

42:30.422 --> 42:31.507
Maybe...

42:33.133 --> 42:37.096
Maybe we could go to counseling after all?

42:41.725 --> 42:43.352
Don't go home to the city.

42:45.646 --> 42:48.816
Spend the night here.
We can wake up together with the kids.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.070
That's not what I meant.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.907
Yeah, but if you're not with Brad...

43:06.500 --> 43:07.710
There's somebody else.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.092
You need to go.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.886
Cooper, hang on.
Hang on a second. We should talk.

43:17.886 --> 43:21.223
- I said get out.
- Okay, please don't do this again.

43:21.223 --> 43:24.310
