00:26.398 --> 00:27.912
Next item on the agenda,

00:27.913 --> 00:29.794
I'm afraid that
due to funding cuts,

00:29.795 --> 00:32.234
we've had to sell the
science department skeleton

00:32.235 --> 00:33.119
and replace it with

00:33.120 --> 00:34.678
this Halloween costume.

00:35.222 --> 00:36.221
Thank you, Willie.

00:36.222 --> 00:37.629
Now, please return it

00:37.630 --> 00:38.761
to its plastic snap case.

00:39.086 --> 00:40.260
Moving on--

00:40.264 --> 00:41.701
our class trip to Italy

00:41.701 --> 00:44.010
is now spaghetti night
at Papa John's,

00:44.010 --> 00:46.232
and your $1,500 deposits

00:46.239 --> 00:47.912
will not be refunded.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.832
Ooh, Papa John's!

00:49.836 --> 00:51.550
We will conclude by
passing around a sheet

00:51.566 --> 00:53.691
on which I would like
everyone's e-mail address.

00:59.887 --> 01:00.711
What's wrong?

01:00.716 --> 01:02.923
I can't fill out
that clipboard.

01:03.075 --> 01:04.912
I don't have e-mail.

01:06.096 --> 01:07.960
Oh, Marge, you got
to get on the Net.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.142
It's got all the best
conspiracy theories.

01:10.147 --> 01:13.370
Did you know that Hezbollah
owns Little Dolly Snack Cakes?

01:13.388 --> 01:15.270
This stuff will
rock your world!

01:15.278 --> 01:18.991
Fine, I'll log onto
Wahoo or Yippy

01:18.998 --> 01:22.433
or A-O-K or Pooka-dooka,
whatever it's called.

01:22.436 --> 01:24.363
Can we move this
meeting along?

01:24.367 --> 01:25.650
I pay my taxes,

01:25.658 --> 01:27.923
I expect my orange drink!

01:32.385 --> 01:34.121
Ambrosia!

01:34.616 --> 01:35.563
And this Web site

01:35.565 --> 01:36.771
will tell you the weather.

01:36.866 --> 01:37.842
Sunny ?

01:39.178 --> 01:40.690
I never have to look out

01:40.696 --> 01:41.992
the window again.

01:41.996 --> 01:43.560
<i>Let's go surfing now,</i>

01:43.565 --> 01:45.181
<i>everybody's learning how</i>

01:45.197 --> 01:47.812
<i>Come on and safari with me</i>

01:47.818 --> 01:50.531
Paper towels
for 69 cents.

01:50.537 --> 01:52.053
68 cents.

01:52.056 --> 01:53.692
66 cents!

01:53.698 --> 01:54.982
Kids, get in the car!

01:54.987 --> 01:57.283
We're going to Pennsylvania!

01:57.597 --> 01:58.373
Ooh.

02:02.328 --> 02:06.170
629,000 results?!

02:06.175 --> 02:07.200
Wow.

02:07.206 --> 02:08.293
And all this time,

02:08.295 --> 02:11.009
I thought "Googling yourself"
meant the other thing.

02:11.848 --> 02:13.351
Your House From Space

02:15.147 --> 02:16.843
It's our house!

02:16.848 --> 02:18.931
But what's that thing ?

02:20.198 --> 02:21.540
Everyone can see you!

02:21.548 --> 02:22.781
Get inside!

02:22.786 --> 02:23.462
Never !

02:24.455 --> 02:26.242
Just put on a towel!

02:26.247 --> 02:28.192
Why don't I just
put on a dress?

02:30.678 --> 02:32.410
Homer, you've met my parents.

02:32.538 --> 02:34.393
Not naked, I haven't.

02:35.586 --> 02:37.280
That Internet has it all.

02:37.286 --> 02:38.813
Today, I found I had the same

02:38.817 --> 02:40.642
birthday as Randy Quaid,

02:40.645 --> 02:42.380
I MapQuested a great new

02:42.398 --> 02:43.731
route to the armory,

02:43.738 --> 02:45.543
and I got a list of local houses

02:45.548 --> 02:46.973
where I'm not letting you kids

02:46.978 --> 02:48.201
trick or treat anymore.

02:48.217 --> 02:49.473
I'm proud of you, Mom.

02:49.476 --> 02:50.982
You're like
Christopher Columbus.

02:50.985 --> 02:52.951
You discovered something
millions of people

02:52.958 --> 02:54.370
knew about before you.

02:57.946 --> 02:59.653
MailBox
Welcome Marge
You have No new messages.

02:59.658 --> 03:01.481
I sent everyone I know an e-card

03:01.487 --> 03:02.923
for St. Patrick's Day,

03:02.928 --> 03:05.151
but not one person
wrote me back.

03:05.358 --> 03:06.960
Hmm. Maybe if I hit "Refresh."

03:07.896 --> 03:08.872
Still nothing.

03:08.877 --> 03:10.742
But maybe now. Or now.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.691
The only thing that changes

03:13.697 --> 03:15.572
is the banner ad.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.653
Ooh.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.943
Earthland Realms?

03:27.115 --> 03:29.342
Earthland Realms
is a multiplayer

03:29.348 --> 03:31.172
online role-playing game.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.732
Do you agree to the following
terms and conditions?

03:37.396 --> 03:39.193
"For amusement only.

03:39.195 --> 03:42.591
Credit card information may be sold to Korean gangsters."

03:42.595 --> 03:44.271
Just click "Agree."

03:44.275 --> 03:46.893
Step one, create your character.

03:48.697 --> 03:49.861
Let's see.

03:49.865 --> 03:52.802
What kind of goofy
goobly should I be?

03:52.806 --> 03:53.671
Whoa.

03:53.678 --> 03:55.832
Look at those bazooms.

03:55.837 --> 03:57.453
Who designed this character?

03:57.458 --> 03:58.760
Probably a man.

03:59.087 --> 04:01.421
Hmm! I can make her look any way I want.

04:01.425 --> 04:02.402
Let's see.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.991
Hair: blue.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.630
Shoes: sensible.

04:05.638 --> 04:07.710
Body type: Olive Oyl.

04:07.796 --> 04:09.193
Face: other.

04:09.568 --> 04:10.750
That's better.

04:10.756 --> 04:12.832
Now, let's role... play.

04:14.177 --> 04:17.101
Wow, it's like a renaissance fair,

04:17.107 --> 04:19.480
but without all the chubby couples.

04:20.875 --> 04:23.351
This is really annoying.

04:23.355 --> 04:24.903
You're telling me.

04:27.905 --> 04:29.452
Greetings, Cleric.

04:29.455 --> 04:32.381
Will you undertake a quest on my behalf?

04:32.386 --> 04:35.272
Eh, maybe I should run this by my husband first.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.561
Things are more fun if you just answer "yes."

04:37.566 --> 04:38.392
Then, yes.

04:38.396 --> 04:41.321
Hither me forth on mine arduous quest.

04:41.338 --> 04:42.863
Once again,just "yes."

04:42.867 --> 04:43.881
Yes.

04:43.887 --> 04:47.770
First, you must find the Armandahl of Nuxinor.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.830
All I see is that rock.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.110
You have found it!

04:52.115 --> 04:53.373
Oh!

04:54.347 --> 04:58.252
Okay, activate my level seven power stones.

05:00.006 --> 05:02.280
Wield the orb of oblivion.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.131
And zap!

05:09.017 --> 05:11.491
Hmm, needs more goat soul.

05:11.495 --> 05:12.312
Mom?!

05:12.917 --> 05:15.353
What are you kids doing up so late?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.322
We just got up.

05:16.327 --> 05:17.583
It's 7:00 a.m.

05:18.126 --> 05:20.300
I was on the computer all night!

05:20.356 --> 05:22.241
Actually, it's Saturday.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.332
I played a day and a night.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.343
Bart, it's not Saturday.

05:28.348 --> 05:28.842
Shh.

05:33.656 --> 05:36.173
I should get some sleep.

05:39.475 --> 05:41.842
I better check on my elf-self.

05:46.577 --> 05:47.912
Thank you.
Come again.

05:47.918 --> 05:49.112
Apu?

05:49.118 --> 05:50.190
Mrs. Homer.

05:50.195 --> 05:52.152
How nice to see you in the Realms.

05:52.157 --> 05:53.850
How did you get in my game?

05:53.867 --> 05:54.891
Are you a virus?

05:54.896 --> 05:55.552
Oh, no.

05:55.557 --> 05:57.082
I, too, am online playing.

05:57.097 --> 05:58.403
That cobra king over there

05:58.406 --> 05:59.740
is actually Snake.

05:59.824 --> 06:03.212
The prison guards think I'm getting
my online law degree.

06:03.301 --> 06:04.268
Ha, ha!

06:04.390 --> 06:06.942
And that beguiling enchantress is Mrs. Krabappel.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.450
This game is a great way to meet eligible men

06:09.458 --> 06:10.800
who can afford a computer.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.490
Or have access to one
at the school library.

06:15.617 --> 06:18.870
It's amazing how you can
be a turkey in every reality.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.872
What's important is we're talking.

06:22.145 --> 06:22.963
I'm Moe.

06:22.968 --> 06:24.913
I'm playing this while I'm on the can.

06:24.916 --> 06:26.661
Wow, Moe!

06:26.667 --> 06:27.912
You're a troll.

06:27.918 --> 06:28.791
What ?
No.

06:28.798 --> 06:31.080
My character's supposed to look like me.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.261
Why does everyone keep thinking I'm a troll?!

06:47.906 --> 06:49.552
Who are we hiding from?

06:49.557 --> 06:50.571
The Shadow Knight.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.591
Where he rides, death is sure to follow.

06:53.677 --> 06:54.702
The Shadow Knight?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.271
He's the most evil,destructive player in this game.

06:57.278 --> 06:59.711
He once beat me to death with my own life bar.

07:01.936 --> 07:02.512
Mmm...

07:03.115 --> 07:03.603
mmm.

07:05.598 --> 07:08.982
Who dares battle with the Shadow Knight?

07:11.545 --> 07:12.501
Oh...

07:16.897 --> 07:18.090
He was a good man.

07:20.158 --> 07:21.811
A good, moist man.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.271
Eww.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.961
I can't watch this.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.820
Another senseless killing by...

07:31.827 --> 07:33.722
the Shadow Knight!

07:33.727 --> 07:34.650
Hmm?

07:37.937 --> 07:40.511
My son is an evil knight!

07:41.518 --> 07:45.460
The most successful evil knight in all the Earthland Realms!

07:45.466 --> 07:46.351
Not bad.

07:49.905 --> 07:52.531
Aye carumba, what a day!

07:53.426 --> 07:54.953
Brave sir knight?

07:54.958 --> 07:56.201
What is it, Lady Milhouse?

07:56.205 --> 07:57.390
I'm not a lady,

07:57.395 --> 08:00.423
it's a spell, a spell you said you'd reverse.

08:00.428 --> 08:01.893
Yeah, yeah, it's on my list.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.931
Anyway, someone's here to see you.

08:03.937 --> 08:04.743
Hi, Bart!

08:04.746 --> 08:05.993
It's your mom!

08:05.996 --> 08:08.013
I'm in your videogame with you!

08:08.015 --> 08:08.603
What?

08:10.345 --> 08:11.770
Why Milhouse,

08:11.775 --> 08:13.263
don't you look pretty!

08:13.266 --> 08:14.803
It's a spell!

08:14.858 --> 08:16.303
And thank you.

08:17.655 --> 08:19.830
Mom, what are you doing in my game?!

08:19.837 --> 08:20.663
How would you like it

08:20.668 --> 08:22.570
if I suddenly started going shopping with you?

08:22.577 --> 08:24.200
I'd like that very much.

08:26.397 --> 08:28.941
Uh, wh-what can I get ya,Mr. Shadow Knight, sir?

08:28.948 --> 08:30.283
A grog? Grog light?

08:30.297 --> 08:31.772
Uh, diet grog with lemon?

08:31.776 --> 08:34.811
Just wring the blood from this pixie head.

08:34.836 --> 08:35.371
Yes, sir.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.501
Hi, everybody!

08:37.568 --> 08:39.212
How do you play this game?

08:39.216 --> 08:39.760
Ow!

08:39.765 --> 08:41.140
Haaaaaaa....

08:41.148 --> 08:42.732
Oooohh!!

08:44.658 --> 08:47.103
Now flog yourself with this mace

08:47.106 --> 08:50.023
while reciting the Goblin's Code!

08:50.028 --> 08:51.201
Goblin's Code,yes, sir!

08:51.205 --> 08:53.480
All goblins must be free of visible worms.

08:53.486 --> 08:54.043
Oooh!

08:54.045 --> 08:55.252
In the presence of a lady,

08:55.256 --> 08:57.653
a goblin must remove his hat and ears.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.523
Bart, are you drinking?

09:05.085 --> 09:06.293
Mom!

09:07.405 --> 09:09.873
You're making me look bad
in front of my minions!

09:09.878 --> 09:12.140
If they think less of you because of me,

09:12.146 --> 09:14.102
then they're not really your minions.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.082
I'm going off to explore

09:16.086 --> 09:17.400
the Crevices of Lagrimmar.

09:17.506 --> 09:19.100
Great, I'll come with you.

09:19.106 --> 09:20.263
Shouldn't you bundle up?

09:20.368 --> 09:22.262
Here, let me enchant your pants.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.070
Hey, Lisa,

09:25.076 --> 09:26.723
self-conscious about your shins?

09:26.727 --> 09:29.252
In my day, girls were worried about their boobs.

09:29.255 --> 09:31.491
Dad, I'm going to play soccer.

09:33.528 --> 09:34.813
I fell in love with the game

09:34.816 --> 09:36.663
when I saw Bend It Like Beckham.

09:38.087 --> 09:40.572
Father, I am proud
of my cultural heritage,

09:40.738 --> 09:42.241
but I also love soccer !

09:43.475 --> 09:45.410
You tell him, Jesminder !

09:45.597 --> 09:47.331
I forbid you to bend
it like Beckham.

09:47.607 --> 09:49.682
Plus, you must marry
this complete stranger.

09:49.868 --> 09:52.082
His father is an important
business acquaintance of mine.

09:52.267 --> 09:53.401
Love counts for nothing !

09:53.527 --> 09:55.022
You tell her, Mr. Dhanabhai !

09:55.206 --> 09:57.420
Business contacts are more
important than love!

09:59.387 --> 10:00.923
Wait, that's soccer ?

10:01.097 --> 10:03.003
I always called it "human foosball."

10:03.117 --> 10:04.771
Would you like me to
take you to your game ?

10:04.868 --> 10:06.371
You already promised you would.

10:06.568 --> 10:07.892
Aw, do I have to ?

10:11.217 --> 10:12.400
Okay, Morty, I'll tell them.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.560
Sorry, ladies.

10:13.705 --> 10:16.230
We got no referee,
so the game's been canceled.

10:18.087 --> 10:20.900
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you're very disappointed.

10:22.535 --> 10:24.412
- What happened to the ref ?
- He quit !

10:24.628 --> 10:26.321
Being a ref is athankless job...

10:26.508 --> 10:27.552
the parents hate ya...

10:27.715 --> 10:30.331
the only upside is the kids
share their snack with you.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.271
Did someone say "snack" ?

10:34.657 --> 10:35.761
I'll be your ref!

10:37.637 --> 10:39.151
Dad, where'd you get that outfit ?

10:39.316 --> 10:40.600
I got fired from Foot Locker.

10:41.176 --> 10:44.053
<i>Kicks just keep getting
harder to find...</i>

10:45.016 --> 10:46.093
What's the matter, buddy ?

10:46.195 --> 10:48.023
The American flag not
good enough for ya ?

10:49.176 --> 10:50.512
That was my father.

10:50.727 --> 10:52.012
I'm your father now.

10:52.198 --> 10:53.343
I'm open !
I'm open !

10:54.115 --> 10:56.611
<i>No, but not with kicks</i>

10:58.166 --> 11:00.472
<i>You just need help, girl...</i>

11:05.468 --> 11:07.073
So... tired.

11:10.647 --> 11:13.313
Could someone bring me
another barf cone ?

11:13.918 --> 11:16.622
So... I thought it went real well.

11:17.045 --> 11:18.823
Until I swallowed the whistle.

11:19.086 --> 11:20.482
You don't evenknow the rules!

11:20.608 --> 11:23.851
This cld be my new thing,
and you're turning it into a joke!

11:24.187 --> 11:26.701
- Hilarious joke ?
- Sadly, no.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.380
I'm disappointed with the way
you acted today...

11:29.808 --> 11:31.130
but I'm not surprised.

11:44.235 --> 11:45.810
Oh, let's see.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.660
Should I take the Trail of
Death, or the Path of Doom?

11:48.985 --> 11:50.262
Maybe I should just go back.

11:53.815 --> 11:55.843
Is this Wall Street Journal online?

11:59.696 --> 12:00.791
Well, well,

12:00.916 --> 12:03.910
looks like something's finally
about to happen in this game.

12:03.996 --> 12:04.841
Just in time.

12:04.938 --> 12:06.863
I was about to go to
the Pottery Barn site

12:06.945 --> 12:08.292
to get design ideas.

12:11.516 --> 12:12.841
It's the Shadow Knight !

12:13.018 --> 12:14.640
- Run !
- I forget how to do that.

12:14.765 --> 12:15.761
Control-shift-R...

12:18.766 --> 12:20.011
Thank you, Bart.

12:20.137 --> 12:22.313
This frame grab's going
on my coffee cup.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.183
You guys wanna meet
at the Kwik-E-Mart?

12:25.265 --> 12:26.461
I'm in the tub right now.

12:26.618 --> 12:27.841
I'm in Denmark!

12:31.766 --> 12:33.140
Hand ball !
Direct kick !

12:34.966 --> 12:36.490
Dad, I'm impressed !

12:36.587 --> 12:38.562
You've become
a much better referee.

12:38.737 --> 12:39.532
Thanks, honey.

12:39.716 --> 12:43.740
After what you said to me,
I watched hours and hours of soccer.

12:43.968 --> 12:45.130
I almost saw a goal !

12:45.398 --> 12:48.490
But there were so many ads
for Spanish cell phones.

12:52.248 --> 12:53.242
Do it, sweetie!

12:53.366 --> 12:54.943
Save our troubled marriage!

13:02.517 --> 13:03.661
Foul on 23 !

13:03.767 --> 13:04.560
That's crazy.

13:04.668 --> 13:07.172
Your daughter just tripped
on her own clumsy feet!

13:07.387 --> 13:08.970
Come on, Lisa.
Admit it !

13:10.515 --> 13:13.681
I'm a spectator addressing
a player-- answer me!

13:15.087 --> 13:17.521
I said foul on 23!

13:20.877 --> 13:23.620
You are so blind,
even Jesus couldn't heal you!

13:23.807 --> 13:26.561
Helen, please.
Don't drop the J bomb.

13:26.668 --> 13:28.911
Well, I'm throwing you
both out of the game!

13:39.106 --> 13:40.363
She tripped me.

13:45.277 --> 13:46.461
Foul on the other girl.

13:46.578 --> 13:47.861
Lisa gets apenalty kick,

13:48.016 --> 13:49.850
and every other
kid has to pay her a dollar.

13:50.107 --> 13:51.540
That is an outrage !

13:51.616 --> 13:53.212
Your daughter's been
floppin' all day !

13:53.308 --> 13:55.363
She has not.
Your daughter's rty player.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.923
Sir, I have sired adum-dum,
a mush-head,

13:59.038 --> 14:00.803
a what's-it, a dog boy,

14:00.976 --> 14:03.682
and somethin' with a
human face and fish body,

14:03.768 --> 14:07.582
what we called Kevin,
but my young'uns is not dirty players.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.951
I don't need a soccer lecture
from a hillbilly.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.553
That's hill-William to you, sir.

14:12.725 --> 14:15.521
How about a lecture from me,
Ronaldo ?

14:16.157 --> 14:17.393
Ronaldo ?!

14:17.615 --> 14:21.770
Winner of two World Cups and three FIFA
Player of the Year awards ?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.531
Yes, I what you said.

14:23.806 --> 14:26.742
Now I travel the world
exposiloppers,

14:26.926 --> 14:28.701
and your daughter is a flopper.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.313
Now, Ronaldo away !

14:32.775 --> 14:33.982
You heard Geraldo.

14:34.176 --> 14:35.253
What's it gonna be ?

14:38.636 --> 14:39.640
Yellow card !

14:40.375 --> 14:42.450
You can't give me a yellow card.

14:42.617 --> 14:43.882
You're my father.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.513
When I put on these
shorts, I'm not your father anymore,

14:46.708 --> 14:48.022
and judging by how tight they are,

14:48.088 --> 14:49.892
I'm never going to be
anyone else's, either.

14:50.755 --> 14:53.491
This is what I think
of your yellow card!

14:54.325 --> 14:56.330
Unsportsman
like conduct.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.621
That's a red card.

14:57.807 --> 14:59.560
- You're out of the game !
- But... but...

14:59.806 --> 15:00.810
Oh !

15:01.636 --> 15:04.192
Another family broken
up by Ronaldo.

15:04.587 --> 15:05.651
Yes !

15:06.805 --> 15:07.993
What a fun quest !

15:08.167 --> 15:10.632
Aren't you glad I made you
take that na thedle?

15:10.766 --> 15:11.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:11.808 --> 15:13.853
Let me just put this holy
grail in my trophy room.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.512
Whoa !
Where's al stuff ?!

15:17.746 --> 15:19.231
I thought all the swords

15:19.446 --> 15:22.720
and severed heads were kind
of gory, so I redecorated

15:22.806 --> 15:25.002
using the Hello Kitty
expansion pack.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.601
No !

15:32.628 --> 15:33.420
Mom ?

15:34.095 --> 15:34.992
Mom ?!

15:35.516 --> 15:38.501
I was killed by my own son.

15:40.377 --> 15:42.173
How could you kill
your own mother?

15:42.308 --> 15:43.353
It was just a game.

15:43.598 --> 15:46.602
A game I used to enjoy
before you mommed all oit.

15:46.975 --> 15:48.033
Lisa, sweetie,

15:48.186 --> 15:49.982
- I was just following the rules.
- Great.

15:50.156 --> 15:52.091
The one time you actually
do something right,

15:52.305 --> 15:53.943
you ruin my life.

15:56.377 --> 15:58.141
I thinkI'l
l go to bed.

15:58.316 --> 16:01.561
- It's 5:00 in the afternoon.
- Who cares ? I'm dead.

16:02.035 --> 16:03.372
Ju' nys!

16:03.536 --> 16:04.583
Those damesare cheesed.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.420
Son, I'll never understand
women if I live to be 40.

16:08.665 --> 16:11.640
- Big if.
- Enjoy me while I last.

16:15.417 --> 16:16.691
Want to go slam a few beers ?

16:16.817 --> 16:18.383
- If you watch me ?
- You know it.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.383
What's the matter,
Homer and Bart?

16:24.558 --> 16:26.970
Lisa's mad at me,
and Marge is am.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.962
Well, I'm juthe bartender here,

16:29.127 --> 16:31.081
but it seems to me, you
could win Lisa back

16:31.217 --> 16:32.731
by appealing to hersense of reason,

16:33.017 --> 16:34.021
and you could win your Mom back

16:34.125 --> 16:35.793
by appealing to her feelings.

16:36.048 --> 16:38.170
He, Moe, you give good advice.

16:38.346 --> 16:40.642
Yeah. What have you done
of the real Moe ?

16:49.845 --> 16:52.490
Lisa honey,
I brought you something

16:52.775 --> 16:55.590
- a DVD !
- Not interested.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.342
A documentary.

16:57.525 --> 16:58.900
By the BBC.

16:59.216 --> 17:01.611
In coorporation with Canal +.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.162
Give me ! Give me !

17:06.377 --> 17:08.819
Brighton, England, 1985.

17:09.095 --> 17:11.790
Manchester United plays
Sussexton-Hamptonshire-Unleath

17:12.107 --> 17:14.193
when a deadly riot breaks
out in the stands.

17:14.476 --> 17:16.621
Oi, your boy's a flopper he is.

17:16.796 --> 17:18.151
No he isn't ! He isn't !

17:18.348 --> 17:19.893
Your mother can kiss me bum.

17:33.656 --> 17:34.920
22 years later,

17:35.195 --> 17:36.613
this riot is still going on.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.550
Last year in Brazil,

17:42.718 --> 17:44.661
an on-field scuffle
turned so violent,

17:44.896 --> 17:47.450
locals say a statue of
the Virgin Mary came alive...

17:48.658 --> 17:50.173
and beat the holy snot out

17:50.266 --> 17:51.091
of everyone.

18:11.707 --> 18:13.340
Mom, I'm going to give you life

18:13.496 --> 18:15.230
the way I imagineyou gave me life--

18:15.406 --> 18:17.182
by pressing alt-F-5 repeatedly.

18:29.047 --> 18:31.760
Bart, you brought me back to life!

18:33.068 --> 18:34.312
As best you could.

18:45.536 --> 18:47.241
Sweetie, are you
here to forgive me?

18:48.025 --> 18:48.791
No.

18:49.696 --> 18:53.092
Oh! But to get that DVD,
I had to become a PBS subscriber.

18:53.357 --> 18:56.923
Now I'm paying for crap
like American Masters.

18:58.536 --> 19:01.813
Dad, I can't forgive you,
because there's nothing to forgive.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.581
You were right
to kick me out of that game.

19:04.786 --> 19:06.740
Soccer was making me insane,

19:06.957 --> 19:10.002
just as it did the continents
of Europe and South America.

19:10.205 --> 19:12.153
Those places are pretty terrible.

19:12.408 --> 19:14.143
So from now on,
I'll play soccer

19:14.348 --> 19:17.033
for the same reason
I study chemistry-- for fun.

19:18.738 --> 19:19.923
Do you want to play a little?

19:20.116 --> 19:21.531
I sure do.

19:22.825 --> 19:25.493
Wait till I tell the other moms
you gave two-thirds

19:25.648 --> 19:27.731
of your lifeforce to save me.

19:27.937 --> 19:29.321
What a good boy.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.240
This way.

19:32.495 --> 19:34.632
Slay him and take
his experience points!

19:36.058 --> 19:36.933
Wait. Stop !

19:37.095 --> 19:41.202
If you kill me, I'll egg
your houses in real life!

19:41.505 --> 19:42.711
It's still worth it.

19:43.896 --> 19:44.912
I live in a loft !

19:46.545 --> 19:48.231
My jewels!

19:51.896 --> 19:53.730
All righ t
! I gothis flame sword !

19:58.816 --> 20:00.230
Aw, come on.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.930
The Shadow Knights
hall rule no more

20:07.168 --> 20:09.622
We've spilt his blood
upon the floor

20:10.526 --> 20:12.903
With a hi and a ho
and a trolly lolly lay

20:13.278 --> 20:17.363
It's the jolly merrymonth of May!

20:21.488 --> 20:22.601
Don't worry, honey.

20:22.775 --> 20:25.110
I'll hunt down our friends
who murdered you...

20:25.336 --> 20:26.941
one by one.

20:28.107 --> 20:29.941
Whatever.
I'm gonna go play outside.

20:38.017 --> 20:39.071
Look what I can do !

20:43.665 --> 20:45.122
I have taught you well.

20:45.776 --> 20:46.853
Too well.

20:48.777 --> 20:50.441
Mom, are you sure you
don't want to play?

20:50.637 --> 20:52.143
No, no. I'm fine.

20:55.757 --> 20:58.480
Why am I paying $14.95
a month for this?
