WEBVTT

00:21.005 --> 00:22.925
How was everything, madam?

00:23.005 --> 00:25.285
I'm afraid I won't be paying.

00:25.365 --> 00:27.325
There was a hair in my food.

00:27.405 --> 00:30.165
Sloppy, very sloppy.

00:30.245 --> 00:31.725
But you still ate the food.

00:31.805 --> 00:34.165
And this is the third time this week
this has happened.

00:34.245 --> 00:38.325
What can I say? Maybe you British people
need to shave your chefs more often.

00:39.365 --> 00:42.045
It's almost as though you're trying
to get out of paying the bill.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.245
You are hilarious.

00:47.325 --> 00:49.245
That really tickled me.

00:52.845 --> 00:58.285
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:17.925 --> 01:19.165
Shit!

01:35.085 --> 01:37.885
-Hey there, Dylan.
-Ivy, it's not what it looks like.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.485
Er, what <i>does </i>it look like?

01:39.565 --> 01:41.405
-Like you're dealing drugs.
-No. No way.

01:41.485 --> 01:47.165
Mate, mate. I think I gave you two 20s
instead of a 20 and a ten for the drugs.

01:49.045 --> 01:51.245
Go on. Just don't tell Mum and Dad.

01:51.325 --> 01:52.845
What kind of drugs are we talking about?

01:52.925 --> 01:55.285
Quaalude, K2, benzodiazepine?

01:55.365 --> 01:58.165
-So hot right now.
-How do you know all of this?

01:58.245 --> 02:01.085
I used to live four doors down
from Snoop Dogg.

02:01.165 --> 02:03.645
We used to get high
and watch American Idol.

02:03.725 --> 02:06.725
Man, I miss Snoop Dogg Sundays.

02:08.205 --> 02:11.165
-Do you want to see my weed farm?
-Hell, yeah!

02:11.765 --> 02:12.765
Ha!

02:17.165 --> 02:20.845
Yeah, we're used to showing people
round bungalows, so this is a nice change.

02:22.125 --> 02:23.125
Whoa!

02:24.165 --> 02:26.325
-Come on in.
-Alrighty, then.

02:29.725 --> 02:33.085
This place is huge!
It reminds me of my old pool house.

02:33.645 --> 02:36.165
Literally,
there's just an attic sitting there.

02:36.245 --> 02:38.285
Why not make a little bit of extra money?

02:39.445 --> 02:43.525
-Welcome to my drug empire.

02:50.405 --> 02:51.645
What have you got?

02:51.725 --> 02:54.725
Some of my old diaries. I thought I might
write them up into a book.

02:54.805 --> 02:56.445
Is this because of your sister?

02:56.525 --> 02:59.765
Ken, you're great just as you are.
Look at what you've achieved.

02:59.845 --> 03:01.045
What have I achieved?

03:02.685 --> 03:05.885
Um, well... I wasn't really expecting
a follow-up there.

03:05.965 --> 03:06.965
Thank you.

03:07.045 --> 03:08.485
Morning, Thompsons.

03:09.405 --> 03:11.805
Can't stay and chat,
got deals to do, but I just thought

03:11.885 --> 03:14.685
I'd bring round some gifts
before I go and meet Auntie Ivy.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.285
Mum, that's for you.
Rach, there you are.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.645
I don't really like you spending
so much time with her, Dylan.

03:19.725 --> 03:23.845
She's a very damaged,
troubled individual with amazing hair.

03:23.925 --> 03:25.645
No offence, but she's much cooler
than any of you pricks.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.405
Dylan, that is very offensive.

03:27.485 --> 03:30.205
-Wow, Armani?
-Mm, the real deal.

03:30.285 --> 03:32.245
Yeah, there's only one R in Armani.

03:33.285 --> 03:34.605
Yeah, all right, they're fakes

03:34.685 --> 03:36.805
but come on, they're the best fakes
on the market, they weren't cheap.

03:36.885 --> 03:40.605
There <i>are </i>other ways of showing someone
you love them other than consumerism.

03:40.685 --> 03:42.285
Me and Tash were talking
about this yesterday.

03:42.365 --> 03:44.565
We think we should just get rid
of consumerism.

03:44.645 --> 03:46.165
-Just get rid of it, yeah?
- Yeah.

03:46.245 --> 03:49.925
So all shops and businesses have gone?
I hope you've grown some veg, Rachel,

03:50.005 --> 03:51.805
because there's going to be shit-all
for dinner tonight.

03:51.885 --> 03:53.365
-Well-argued, Dad.
-Mm.

03:53.445 --> 03:55.485
Aw, there's an inscription.
"Love you, Mum."

03:56.845 --> 04:00.965
-"Twat"? Thanks.
-Oi, where's my gift?

04:02.845 --> 04:05.525
A grand cash
if you shit yourself right now.

04:05.605 --> 04:07.405
Dylan, I have told you before,

04:07.485 --> 04:09.605
I'm not going to deliberately
shit my pants.

04:09.685 --> 04:12.885
Fair enough,
but I'll find your ceiling one day.

04:14.245 --> 04:15.565
Oh, wow. Listen to this.

04:15.645 --> 04:18.365
"Met a girl at The Hummingbird
tonight - Lorna.

04:18.445 --> 04:20.445
Asked her out for a drink next week."

04:20.525 --> 04:21.965
Aw, you two!

04:22.045 --> 04:23.445
-Sweet, wasn't I?
-Yeah!

04:23.525 --> 04:25.805
"She seems all right,
but don't know if it'll go anywhere.

04:25.885 --> 04:27.405
She is only an estate agent."

04:29.045 --> 04:31.965
Oh. Now, context is important here.

04:32.045 --> 04:33.805
Only an estate agent?

04:33.885 --> 04:37.885
Ken, I had men fighting
in the streets over me.

04:37.965 --> 04:40.925
Well, you didn't, did you, Lorn?
You just lived in a rough area.

04:41.485 --> 04:44.245
Come on, Lorn. Everyone thinks
estate agents are cocks.

04:46.045 --> 04:49.205
Great. I'm a cock. Thanks very much.

04:49.765 --> 04:52.685
-No, Lorn... Lorn!

04:52.765 --> 04:54.845
Look at Dylan, it sort of proves my point.

04:55.845 --> 04:58.005
"Boy George was on
<i>Top Of The Pops </i>again.

04:58.085 --> 04:59.445
She's beautiful."

05:00.245 --> 05:02.885
The '80s were a very confusing decade.

05:05.245 --> 05:09.005
I've got a surprise for you.
We've slightly expanded.

05:09.085 --> 05:10.285
Lights, Dylan.

05:12.965 --> 05:15.405
Oh, my God!

05:15.485 --> 05:16.805
Give me the lead.

05:18.565 --> 05:20.125
It's massive!

05:20.605 --> 05:24.685
-I can't believe you've done all of this.
-Please! It was your idea.

05:24.765 --> 05:27.965
Think of me as barely involved,
untraceable.

05:28.525 --> 05:31.165
I'm willing to give you 100% of the credit

05:31.245 --> 05:33.165
for just 50% of the money.

05:33.245 --> 05:36.925
That is so solid of you to do that because
you're the one who's done all the work.

05:37.005 --> 05:39.645
Okey-dokey. We're done here.

05:40.325 --> 05:42.885
Just think about the money
you'll be making.
You'll be able to buy a place like this!

05:45.605 --> 05:50.965
Yeah. Eight beds, swimming pool.
Heck, this place even has a panic room.

05:51.525 --> 05:54.605
Panic room!
We used to have his and hers panic rooms.

05:54.685 --> 05:58.765
Ivy, so, obviously being
a drug dealer is really great

05:58.845 --> 06:02.645
and I'm not scared of prison,
you know, I <i>can </i>do time,

06:02.725 --> 06:06.685
but it's just this whole thing now
all of a sudden seems

06:06.765 --> 06:09.805
a <i>lot </i>more illegal
than what I had going before.

06:09.885 --> 06:11.725
Illegal? It's weed.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.685
In America, you can buy it at the store.

06:13.765 --> 06:17.645
And you are American,
so none of this is illegal.

06:17.725 --> 06:20.005
-My God, that's awesome.
-Sure.

06:20.085 --> 06:22.925
Today, weed farm,
tomorrow, drug factory.

06:23.005 --> 06:25.605
And you know what happens
in drug factories?

06:25.685 --> 06:27.045
Er... murders?

06:27.125 --> 06:31.685
The women have to go topless
to stop them from stealing the product.

06:32.645 --> 06:34.685
But, hang on, when you say topless,
do you mean like bras

06:34.765 --> 06:36.525
or is it actually all out?

06:37.645 --> 06:39.485
Cos sometimes when you go
to these topless beaches,

06:39.565 --> 06:42.805
you get there and the women aren't even
properly topless and it's like,

06:42.885 --> 06:45.085
"I've driven all the way there,
and they must know as well as I do

06:45.165 --> 06:47.645
that petrol does not grow on trees."

06:47.725 --> 06:51.045
-They can be as topless as you want.
-Well, then, count me in, partner.

06:52.005 --> 06:53.525
Silent partner.

06:54.165 --> 06:55.365
Well, OK, then.

06:56.725 --> 06:58.925
Your mum's still not
returning my texts.

06:59.005 --> 07:00.405
What should I do?

07:00.485 --> 07:03.285
Maybe say, "Sorry I belittled
your career, your life,

07:03.365 --> 07:05.525
and cheapened any sense
of self-worth that you have."

07:05.605 --> 07:08.125
Rachel, it was something I wrote
30 years ago.

07:08.205 --> 07:11.205
Besides, estate agents aren't
exactly saving lives, are they?

07:11.285 --> 07:12.965
Later, Dad.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.965
-Where are you off to?
-I'm off to meet Ben and Tash.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.965
You're not still into Ben, are you?

07:20.045 --> 07:22.805
You're spending a lot of time with him
and his new girlfriend.

07:22.885 --> 07:25.045
Oh, my God! No way.

07:25.125 --> 07:27.725
I mean, I love Ben, but he's Ben.

07:27.805 --> 07:31.245
But Tash? Tash is really cool.
We're all going to this protest art thing.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.445
There'll be hundreds of us naked
outside the Bull Ring.

07:33.525 --> 07:36.005
-Why?
-We're protesting inequality.

07:36.085 --> 07:40.045
Right. Well, I'm sure inequality is going
to take a while to get over that kicking.

07:50.725 --> 07:52.205
Yes, hello.

07:52.285 --> 07:56.125
I wonder if I could book an appointment
to see the three-bed terrace on Coalville.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.645
Great.

07:58.725 --> 08:00.965
Who, um... Who covers that area for you?

08:02.605 --> 08:04.605
Lorna Thompson, OK.

08:05.165 --> 08:07.285
Yeah. My name?

08:08.485 --> 08:09.965
It's, um...

08:13.085 --> 08:14.405
David Steel.

08:24.205 --> 08:25.965
Mr Steel? Lorna Thom--

08:27.565 --> 08:30.805
-Ken.
-28 years ago, I was wrong.

08:31.805 --> 08:33.405
I made a mistake.

08:33.485 --> 08:35.925
You're not just an estate agent.
You're a hero.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.765
-Aw!
-And anyway,

08:38.845 --> 08:42.405
yeah, there's a few bad apples,
but if it wasn't for estate agents,

08:42.485 --> 08:45.285
where would <i>The Apprentice</i>
get all their wankers from?

08:46.445 --> 08:48.205
Sorry?

08:48.285 --> 08:50.605
Oh, come here, you big softie.

08:56.605 --> 09:00.205
You sure know how to make
a big romantic gesture, Ken.

09:00.285 --> 09:03.085
I'm not Ken.
Ken belittles people's careers.

09:03.165 --> 09:04.725
David Steel would never do that.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.285
Although he did have
some pretty harsh words

09:07.365 --> 09:09.565
to say about
David Owen's leadership of the SDP.

09:10.805 --> 09:12.645
Sorry. Champagne?

09:12.725 --> 09:14.765
Maybe later,

09:14.845 --> 09:17.645
-Mr Steel.
-Ooh, call me David.

09:21.765 --> 09:24.725
Tell me more about David Steel.

09:24.805 --> 09:29.885
Really? Well, Liberal leader
from '76 to '88.

09:29.965 --> 09:32.325
-For my money, Steel--
-Shut up, Ken.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.205
I don't need the actual facts.

09:34.285 --> 09:35.885
You're ruining the moment.

09:35.965 --> 09:37.485
Are we having a moment?

09:38.045 --> 09:42.805
Well, we're alone together
in an empty house,

09:42.885 --> 09:47.005
and you have 45 minutes
of your viewing time left.

09:49.645 --> 09:51.085
Yes!

09:57.485 --> 09:59.925
-Mm.
-Ha! It's on your nose.

10:00.005 --> 10:02.045
-Oh.
-It's on yours now.

10:02.125 --> 10:04.805
-What's up with you two?

10:04.885 --> 10:06.045
Have you joined a cult?

10:06.125 --> 10:09.045
Just a man and a woman
high on love and life, Rachel.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.045
-OK.
-Let's just say

10:11.125 --> 10:13.245
your dad has made his way back
into my good books.

10:13.325 --> 10:15.885
-Ah, that's nice.
-Twice.

10:18.685 --> 10:20.445
Ooh!

10:21.725 --> 10:23.245
Num-num-num!

10:25.605 --> 10:27.805
We might need some help
when it comes time to harvest.

10:27.885 --> 10:29.285
The homeless will work for nothing, right?

10:30.045 --> 10:32.925
Ah. You two have been spending
a lot of time together.

10:33.485 --> 10:36.845
What can I say?
We're growing our relationship.

10:38.285 --> 10:41.445
Yeah. I guess <i>we'd farm </i>a much b--

10:41.525 --> 10:43.965
-Shut up now, Dylan, honey.
-OK.

10:44.525 --> 10:45.885
Right.

10:47.325 --> 10:48.605
Jesus!

10:49.525 --> 10:51.765
-Steve!
-Rachel, nice evening.

10:51.845 --> 10:53.965
It's starting to really feel like spring.

10:54.045 --> 10:57.645
-What are you doing?
-Just checking up on my beloved, Ivy.

10:58.285 --> 11:00.285
There's something weird going on
between her and Dylan.

11:00.365 --> 11:01.845
Yeah, I've sort of noticed that.

11:01.925 --> 11:04.805
Spending the whole day together,
private conversations.

11:04.885 --> 11:07.725
Yeah, pretty clear
what's happening here.

11:07.805 --> 11:10.685
An incestuous
aunt and nephew relationship.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.325
Are you insane?

11:13.405 --> 11:15.925
-Incest! That is not what is happening.
-It's obvious.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.565
I blame <i>Game Of Thrones</i>.It used
to be that incest was frowned upon.

11:18.645 --> 11:19.645
Illegal.

11:19.725 --> 11:22.005
Since your Lannisters are doing
the Norfolk nasty every other week,

11:22.085 --> 11:23.645
the box is wide open.

11:23.725 --> 11:27.205
Steve, even for you, this is mental, there
is no incest going on in our family.

11:27.285 --> 11:29.925
Coming from a woman
who slept with her husband's son?

11:30.005 --> 11:31.445
That was...

11:31.525 --> 11:33.965
complicated,
and there is nothing going on here.

11:34.045 --> 11:35.565
-Dylan would never...
-Hmm.

11:35.645 --> 11:37.605
-I mean, he'd probably never...
-Yeah.

11:37.685 --> 11:39.805
-Mind you, he has done some weird stuff.
-He has.

11:39.885 --> 11:41.405
Even he'd... Wouldn't he?

11:41.485 --> 11:42.525
Hmm.

11:44.525 --> 11:47.325
-Yeah!

11:49.605 --> 11:52.365
Only one way to find out. Tomorrow,
you and me, we'll follow them.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.685
A good old-fashioned stakeout.

11:53.765 --> 11:56.765
OK, fine, but if I agree to do this, you
leave us alone and stop watching us eat.

11:57.645 --> 11:59.125
-Deal.
-OK.

11:59.205 --> 12:01.925
See you at 0800, and bring a gun,
if you've got one.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.925
-Good evening, Mr Steel.

12:12.645 --> 12:13.645
Oh!

12:19.165 --> 12:21.245
-Get on with it!

12:23.525 --> 12:25.845
-Ms Thompson.
-You find me alone.

12:25.925 --> 12:27.765
My husband's just popped out.

12:27.845 --> 12:31.765
The man's a damn fool, leaving you alone
with a man like me around.

12:31.845 --> 12:33.125
-Yeah, the prick.
-Lorn!

12:33.205 --> 12:35.845
Sorry. Got a bit too into it.
Come on, kiss me.

12:41.765 --> 12:43.765
David, you're so powerful.

12:43.845 --> 12:46.565
Well, what David Steel wants, he gets.

12:47.085 --> 12:49.765
That's why, as a relatively unknown
Liberal backbencher,

12:49.845 --> 12:52.845
he was able to pass
meaningful reform on abortion.

12:52.925 --> 12:54.485
OK, let's stop, Ken.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.405
-Sorry, love, it's just not the same.
-No, I know.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.445
It's just... earlier was so bad,

13:00.525 --> 13:03.245
so exciting, in a... in a strange house.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.645
We could have been caught
at any moment.

13:05.725 --> 13:08.005
I've got an hour free
for viewings tomorrow.

13:08.085 --> 13:12.125
Do you think David Steel would like
to view another property?

13:12.645 --> 13:14.045
Well, I hear he's in town,

13:14.125 --> 13:16.525
and he loved what he saw today,

13:16.605 --> 13:19.325
and he is a very motivated buyer.

13:19.405 --> 13:20.765
Oh, yeah?

13:20.845 --> 13:24.165
-I hear he has a sizeable deposit.
-Yes, he does.

13:25.645 --> 13:28.285
-And he's chain-free.
-That one doesn't work.

13:28.365 --> 13:30.165
No, it doesn't.

13:30.245 --> 13:33.205
Better get some sleep, Mr Steel, you're
going to need your energy tomorrow.

13:33.285 --> 13:34.685
Ooh!

13:35.445 --> 13:37.325
-Night, Lorn.
-Night, Ken.

14:36.685 --> 14:37.805
Look at it.

14:37.885 --> 14:40.645
My own drug empire.

14:41.205 --> 14:45.285
Made this much money in a week!
Man, we make a good team.

14:45.365 --> 14:46.965
My brains and your...

14:48.245 --> 14:50.725
-teeth?
-Yeah, I've always had really good teeth.

14:50.805 --> 14:52.125
Grab the broken lamp.

14:52.205 --> 14:53.965
We gotta get out of here

14:54.045 --> 14:55.885
and let the money grow.

15:00.565 --> 15:01.885
So, what do we do now?

15:01.965 --> 15:06.165
Play the old waiting game,
the old watch and wait,

15:06.245 --> 15:10.525
look and learn,
hide and seek, dance--

15:10.605 --> 15:12.525
Yeah, can we do it without talking?

15:12.605 --> 15:15.485
Not my style, Rach.

15:17.925 --> 15:20.165
Can I tempt you to some stakeout food?

15:20.245 --> 15:23.045
Ugh! Steve, why the hell
have you brought a tub of lamb?

15:23.125 --> 15:25.045
It's got everything - protein, vitamins.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.485
Zinc for testosterone.
Vital if things kick off.

15:28.565 --> 15:31.125
No, I can't have lamb, I'm vegan now.

15:31.205 --> 15:34.565
Me and Tash are both vegan.
Actually, it's really interesting--

15:34.645 --> 15:37.085
I hate to break it to you, Rachel,
it's not interesting.

15:38.845 --> 15:40.485
It's not interesting at all.

15:42.765 --> 15:45.845
-Ugh.
-I've made us a stakeout mix tape.

15:45.925 --> 15:49.245
-Hope you like show tunes.

15:53.725 --> 15:55.045
Hey, Tash.

15:55.685 --> 15:57.565
Yeah, I'm on a stakeout.

15:58.285 --> 15:59.605
No, Steve!

16:00.165 --> 16:02.445
Yeah, I know, mental, right?

16:02.925 --> 16:07.005
Oh, no, you're right.
Er, "mental" is a problematic term.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.325
I said
it's a problematic term.

16:11.165 --> 16:12.765
You've been a real find.

16:12.845 --> 16:14.925
When I first came to Lichfield,
England,

16:15.005 --> 16:18.565
I thought all the Thompsons
were failures, no offence.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.325
I mean, they are, they are all fuck-ups.

16:20.405 --> 16:23.925
Well, but not you.
You've got Big Jack's genes.

16:24.445 --> 16:27.205
I tell you what,
you are not the only one with brains

16:27.285 --> 16:29.205
cos I have come up with the best plan

16:29.285 --> 16:31.925
for how we can shift the rest of our weed.

16:32.005 --> 16:32.925
Great!

16:33.005 --> 16:36.445
Who better to deal drugs
than drug dealers?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.285
Come again?

16:38.365 --> 16:41.205
Yeah, so I've been in touch
with a big local dealer,

16:41.285 --> 16:44.205
told him about our setup,
asked him to come down for a sample.

16:44.285 --> 16:48.005
-Genius or what?
-Dylan, you total idiot!

16:48.645 --> 16:54.525
We have no security and you advertised
our setup to a rival drug dealer!

16:55.245 --> 16:56.885
He's not going to steal it.

16:56.965 --> 16:59.605
-It's the dealers' code.
-Oh, my God!

17:00.165 --> 17:03.005
Did Lorna drop you on your head every day?
-Is that why there's nothing in there?

17:07.085 --> 17:08.765
-Panic room.
-Panic room.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.725
-Fucking heels!
-This way!

17:19.285 --> 17:20.525
Shit! Shit! Shit!

17:20.605 --> 17:22.525
-What are we going to do?
-Sit your ass down!

17:22.605 --> 17:25.205
Think about how dumb you are
and hope they don't break into the attic.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.685
God, they are really
tearing the place apart.

17:32.925 --> 17:36.005
No, you're too strong, David.
You're too powerful.

17:37.725 --> 17:38.845
Oh!

17:44.325 --> 17:48.485
Take me upstairs, David!
Take me upstairs and make love to me.

17:48.565 --> 17:51.165
-Say my name.
- David Steel.

17:53.245 --> 17:54.685
Vote for me!

17:54.765 --> 17:56.045
Vote for me.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.285
-I'll be your ballot box, David.
-Vote for me!

18:04.205 --> 18:05.565
Ivy.

18:08.285 --> 18:10.245
-Nothing happened?
-Nope.

18:11.165 --> 18:13.285
-No?
-No.

18:15.085 --> 18:16.445
I'm gonna take a look.

18:32.405 --> 18:36.165
There must be some way
of getting the security system online.

18:37.805 --> 18:39.285
I did it!

18:39.365 --> 18:41.325
<i>-Yes! Yes!</i>

18:41.405 --> 18:43.325
-Ugh.

18:43.885 --> 18:45.845
You are shitting me.

18:46.405 --> 18:50.005
<i>I'm the founder of the Lib Dems!</i>
<i>I'm the founder of the Lib Dems!</i>

18:50.085 --> 18:52.845
-Look at your parents.
<i>-I started the whole movement!</i>

18:52.925 --> 18:55.085
- We've got company.

18:55.165 --> 18:56.885
Do you think
they're the drug dealers?

18:56.965 --> 19:00.125
-Of course they're the drug dealers.
-Shit, what if they find Mum and Dad?

19:00.205 --> 19:02.925
-Good point, champ, go get 'em.
-I am not going near that.

19:03.005 --> 19:05.405
You're the one who invited
rival drug dealers to our weed farm.

19:11.045 --> 19:12.285
Fuck!

19:16.245 --> 19:17.245
Ivy!

19:17.325 --> 19:18.765
I'm coming!

19:25.205 --> 19:28.485
-Boo!
-Ah! Fucking hell, Tash.

19:28.565 --> 19:32.325
You shit yourself. I thought
we'd come along, join the stakeout.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.245
It's not anything dangerous, is it?

19:34.325 --> 19:37.005
No, it's pretty boring, Ben,
to be honest with you.

19:41.165 --> 19:43.765
Right, put some clothes on,
you are both coming with me.

19:43.845 --> 19:45.565
-Dylan!
-I don't want to hear about it, OK?

19:45.645 --> 19:49.325
-Cover yourselves up and come quickly.
-I'm dressed, Dylan. I'm dressed!

19:50.205 --> 19:52.805
What the hell are you doing here?
I had a viewing booked.

19:52.885 --> 19:55.085
Yes, I saw your "viewing", Mum,

19:55.165 --> 19:56.605
and I will deal with that one day
in therapy,

19:56.685 --> 20:00.125
but right now the priority is
to just get the fuck out of here.

20:00.205 --> 20:01.285
Where's Dad?

20:10.445 --> 20:11.365
Oh.

20:14.205 --> 20:15.485
Yeah!

20:15.565 --> 20:16.565
Pow!

20:17.885 --> 20:19.485
Ooh, David!

20:24.925 --> 20:26.685
Steve should be out by now.

20:27.805 --> 20:29.885
-What if he's in trouble?
-Let's check it out.

20:29.965 --> 20:32.685
Or we could just stay here and, um...

20:32.765 --> 20:34.085
No, OK.

20:34.725 --> 20:38.405
-You're in a drug turf war?
-Only a little one, Mum.

20:38.485 --> 20:40.365
This is your doing, isn't it?

20:40.445 --> 20:43.165
I knew you were a bad influence
the minute you came into our house.

20:43.245 --> 20:45.325
I didn't know anything
about your son's weed farm.

20:45.405 --> 20:46.925
I'm as shocked as you are.

20:47.005 --> 20:50.125
We have to do something.
Your dad could be caught at any minute.

20:51.525 --> 20:52.845
Bloody hell, is he dancing?

20:55.285 --> 20:57.845
-Yes, please, police.
-Not a good play, Lorna.

20:57.925 --> 21:00.725
The police come, you have to show
them your son's drug empire.

21:00.805 --> 21:02.765
Oh, Mum, I can't go to prison.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.365
Please tell the policeman I'm not going
to prison, Mum. I'll be good.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.685
Fine, but get your dad out of there now,
and give those men your dope.

21:11.765 --> 21:14.485
-Oh, Mum, nobody calls it dope.
-Just do it, Dylan.

21:15.445 --> 21:16.485
Bad idea, Dylan.

21:16.565 --> 21:18.645
Think about the money,
all that hard work.

21:18.725 --> 21:20.605
You want to give it away for Ken?

21:26.725 --> 21:28.525
Bloody hell! Steve!

21:32.405 --> 21:34.725
-What happened?
-Dad!

21:34.805 --> 21:36.965
-What the f...?
-Ken!

21:37.525 --> 21:39.005
What are you doing here?

21:39.085 --> 21:42.405
Open your eyes, Rachel!
He's in on the old incest thing, too.
Couldn't resist, could you, Ken, eh?
Picking apples from your own orchard?

21:45.885 --> 21:48.045
Shut up, Steve. What is going on?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.485
-Right!

21:49.565 --> 21:51.525
Give us the farm now,
or we do it the hard way.

21:51.605 --> 21:52.925
Who the fuck are you?

21:53.005 --> 21:56.085
No! Stop, stop, please,
take everything, take the whole farm,

21:56.165 --> 21:58.165
just don't hurt anyone, especially me.

21:58.245 --> 22:00.805
-Everything?
-Yeah, go for it. I'll give you the keys.

22:00.885 --> 22:04.245
Don't shoot! Just don't shoot.
We can sort this out through dialogue.

22:04.325 --> 22:06.005
Mum, I've sorted it, OK?

22:06.085 --> 22:09.605
-They're going to leave.
-Dylan set up a drug farm in this house.

22:09.685 --> 22:10.965
Did he, indeed?

22:11.045 --> 22:13.845
I hope you have learned
a valuable lesson, young man.

22:13.925 --> 22:17.325
Yes, I did, actually, it was don't break
into random houses and start shagging.

22:17.405 --> 22:19.045
Oh, wait! That was you, Dad.

22:19.125 --> 22:21.965
..reduced, but it really does have to be
seen to be believe--

22:24.525 --> 22:25.685
Lorna?

22:25.765 --> 22:26.805
Hi.

22:27.365 --> 22:29.205
Oh, hi, Amanda. Er...

22:30.005 --> 22:33.005
-You remember my husband, Ken?
-Hello, Amanda.

22:35.445 --> 22:37.725
Don't forget to show them
round the library.

22:37.805 --> 22:40.885
-It's a lovely space, isn't it, everyone?
-It's beautiful.

22:40.965 --> 22:42.165
It's full of books.

22:42.245 --> 22:44.325
And I believe the schools
are excellent in the area.

22:45.485 --> 22:48.565
-Really excellent.
-Yeah. I went to that school.

22:49.205 --> 22:51.165
I got really good marks, actually.
