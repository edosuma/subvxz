01:05.649 --> 01:08.739
People are throwing colored powder
and buckets of water at each other...

01:08.777 --> 01:10.697
and I keep getting hit in the face
with this stuff.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.907
So at this point, I must look like
some kind of crazy clown.

01:14.950 --> 01:19.450
And all the while, we're trying to carry on
this incredibly serious discussion...

01:19.496 --> 01:21.706
about antique furniture.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.878
And he's telling me about this piece that
he's found that he thinks I might like.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.208
And then, out of nowhere, he says...

01:26.253 --> 01:28.173
I'm pregnant.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.088
Seriously?

01:55.324 --> 01:56.784
It is beautiful.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.450
It's crazy.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.958
Baby, I don't want to go back.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
What if we stayed here?

02:08.044 --> 02:09.755
Started a family here.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.296
Are you serious?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.466
Why not?

02:14.510 --> 02:17.510
I'm going to have to come three times
a year to source antiques anyway.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.887
What's to keep us from
setting up our base here?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.770
What do you think?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.231
I don't know.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.438
This yours?

02:30.692 --> 02:31.742
Hey.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.699
What are you saying?

02:39.117 --> 02:42.407
I'm asking her if you and I
should stay here forever.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.879
How can you sleep?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.380
So peacefully!

03:31.753 --> 03:34.173
Sweetheart, stop. Stop.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.514
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.929
It's okay.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.637
Stop it, stop it.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.717
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.352
I got you. It's okay, I got you.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.669
Winston, come on.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.461
Winston.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.378
Good boy! Good boy.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.798
Come on, boy.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.295
Come on, Winston.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.518
Lucy.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.559
Come on.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.768
Morning, sweetheart.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.194
- Morning.
- How did you sleep?

04:34.233 --> 04:35.233
Good.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.395
Morning, Piki.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.573
Morning, sir.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.254
Michael.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.721
Yeah, what's up?

05:01.885 --> 05:02.885
I am...

05:03.720 --> 05:07.020
Hey, you don't have to say anything, okay?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.727
I'm lost, Michael.
I don't know if I can live with it.

05:09.768 --> 05:10.888
We're going to be fine.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.726
We'll get through this.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.396
Maria?

06:44.947 --> 06:45.947
Hello?

06:47.366 --> 06:49.776
Mrs. Harwood
retired early for the night, sir.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.196
She had a migraine.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.665
I put Lucy to bed.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.206
Right.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.001
Okay.

06:58.043 --> 06:58.923
'Night, sir.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.091
Night-night, Piki.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.251
Those are F and G fingers.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.507
F and G fingers.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.378
Wrists up like there's an orange.

07:46.425 --> 07:50.105
And a one, two,
a one, two, three, four!

08:12.075 --> 08:13.275
What?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.162
Yeah!

08:15.621 --> 08:16.751
Well done.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.249
A bunch of scribbles.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.330
You guys are fantastic!
Was that really you playing?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.134
It was too good. You sure it wasn't Mommy?

08:24.546 --> 08:25.546
No.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.007
You're telling me it was
really you playing?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.680
That's basically it.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.549
- Can't believe it! My children are geniuses.
- Yeah.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.885
- I'm so proud of you both.
- They worked on it all day just for you.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.232
Happy Father's Day.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.304
We're going to get through this.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.099
Maria?

09:18.725 --> 09:19.805
Maria!

09:19.852 --> 09:21.982
Maria! Open your eyes, sweetheart.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.978
Can you hear me? Maria?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.396
I need you to listen to my voice, please.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.784
Sweetheart, I need you to focus, okay?

09:30.821 --> 09:32.781
I need you to fight this. Please!

09:32.823 --> 09:34.703
Maria, I can't live without you.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.121
Mommy!

09:39.162 --> 09:40.412
Please help me.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.615
Mommy! Mommy!

09:42.416 --> 09:44.706
Mommy, I can't get free!

09:44.751 --> 09:46.631
My leg's stuck!

09:46.879 --> 09:48.129
Luce?

09:48.172 --> 09:49.712
Lucy. No, no, no.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.296
Lucy, please wake up, baby.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.061
- Mommy, get me out!
- Lucy, please wake up!

09:53.760 --> 09:55.010
No, no, no!

09:55.762 --> 09:57.972
Mommy, I can't get free! It hurts!

10:05.314 --> 10:06.944
Please get me out!

10:13.655 --> 10:14.855
Okay, okay.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.157
Please wake up.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.241
I'm scared!

10:18.285 --> 10:21.005
I know you're scared!
I'm scared, too! Pull!

10:21.038 --> 10:23.038
Okay? Oliver, come on.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.461
I don't care if it hurts, you have to pull.
You have to pull!

10:25.501 --> 10:28.001
I know it hurts. You have to pull.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.762
Keep your nose up.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.338
Keep your nose all the way up.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.014
Keep your nose on the ceiling.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.143
We're all going to be okay.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.683
Okay. Okay.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.430
Baby.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.440
I don't know what to do.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.362
Please don't leave me!

10:50.400 --> 10:51.530
I'm sorry, baby.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.818
Mommy!

11:09.461 --> 11:11.301
We need help! Please.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.420
Please, somebody!

11:13.465 --> 11:14.585
We need help!

11:14.633 --> 11:15.883
My boy's in the car!

11:15.926 --> 11:17.756
My boy's in the car! Please!

11:22.766 --> 11:25.226
No! No! My boy!

11:25.269 --> 11:26.689
Ollie!

11:27.104 --> 11:29.274
No, my boy's in the car!

11:29.314 --> 11:31.404
We need to get my boy!

11:31.441 --> 11:33.111
Ollie!

11:33.151 --> 11:34.191
Ollie!

11:48.876 --> 11:49.996
Michael.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.003
Yeah.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.554
She's going to be fine.
But she took a lot of pills.

12:04.683 --> 12:07.353
You are in Bombay Hospital.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.735
Where's Michael?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.364
He's talking to the doctor.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.241
You are lucky to be alive, Mrs. Harwood.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.026
I just can't bear life without him.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.578
I had a daughter once.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.258
Anushka.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.894
She fell into a pond while
trying to pick some plants.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.761
I was looking away for only one minute.

12:50.437 --> 12:54.187
What if I could bring your son
back to you just one more time?

12:56.109 --> 12:59.779
What if I could give you the chance
to say your final goodbye?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.283
What are you talking about?

13:03.951 --> 13:06.951
I was born in a village in South India.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.582
Surrounding our village
was a big forest.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.925
And deep within this forest...

13:14.753 --> 13:16.803
there was an abandoned temple.

13:18.298 --> 13:23.718
It is said that the line between
the world of the dead and the living...

13:24.388 --> 13:27.388
is very thin at this place.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.477
You should go there.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.650
Take the ashes of your son...

13:39.486 --> 13:41.736
spread them on the steps
of this temple...

13:42.406 --> 13:43.986
lock yourself inside...

13:44.449 --> 13:46.489
and when night comes...

13:46.994 --> 13:48.584
he will come to you.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.787
And you will be able to talk to him
through the door of the temple...

13:54.626 --> 13:56.286
say your final goodbye.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.144
I will leave you two alone.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.538
I was so scared I lost you.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.715
I'm sorry.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.263
I'm so, so sorry.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.059
Come on.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.194
Come on, boy.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.625
If we do this...

15:51.326 --> 15:53.786
you have to promise me one thing.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.460
When Oliver comes to you at the temple,
you will be able to speak to him.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.920
But no matter what you do...

16:03.422 --> 16:07.472
no matter what he says
or how much ever he pleads...

16:09.303 --> 16:12.433
you must not open the door.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.972
Promise me.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.596
I promise.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.534
It has been too long.

17:16.494 --> 17:17.704
Let me go.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.050
Khan.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.772
They are the Aghori.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.283
They live by the cremation sites.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.910
They cover themselves in the ashes...

18:34.907 --> 18:37.117
and they feed off the flesh of the dead.

18:39.286 --> 18:43.116
For they believe it helps them communicate
with the other side.

19:09.441 --> 19:12.441
My village is the last stop,
then follow my instructions.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.486
God, Michael.

19:13.529 --> 19:14.449
I will give him your note.

19:14.488 --> 19:16.608
No, he's going to be frantic,
and Lucy needs to know where I am.

19:16.657 --> 19:18.657
I will take care of everything.

19:50.065 --> 19:53.145
Dear Michael, please don't be worried.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.703
I'm just taking a couple of days
to sort my head out.

19:56.989 --> 19:59.699
I desperately want to find a way
to move on...

19:59.741 --> 20:02.081
so that we can be a family again.

20:03.704 --> 20:07.044
I love you and Lucy so, so much.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.749
Be home soon. Maria.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.807
I love you so much.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.533
Who's there?

28:22.160 --> 28:23.200
Oliver?

28:27.541 --> 28:28.711
Who are you?

29:21.011 --> 29:22.221
Oliver?

29:22.638 --> 29:23.718
Mommy?

29:26.141 --> 29:27.731
Mommy, is that you?

29:28.101 --> 29:30.441
Oliver, it's Mommy. Can you hear me?

29:30.479 --> 29:31.479
Yes.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.357
Yes, I can hear you.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.941
Where am I, Mommy?

29:35.984 --> 29:37.824
Baby, press yourself close.

29:37.861 --> 29:40.241
Come up right against the door
and press yourself close...

29:40.280 --> 29:42.120
so we can be close together, okay?

29:43.617 --> 29:45.037
Are you there?

29:45.077 --> 29:46.287
Yes, Mommy.

29:51.500 --> 29:54.340
Oliver, I miss you.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.924
I miss you so much, baby.

29:59.091 --> 30:00.381
You know I love you, right?

30:01.552 --> 30:03.262
More than life itself.

30:03.303 --> 30:04.473
I miss you, too.

30:05.097 --> 30:06.637
I miss Daddy and Lucy.

30:08.475 --> 30:11.055
Oliver, Momma has something to tell you.

30:12.437 --> 30:15.857
I came here because
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

30:17.526 --> 30:19.686
I'm sorry for leaving you.

30:20.362 --> 30:21.912
It wasn't your fault.

30:25.534 --> 30:26.994
I love you, Mommy.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.825
Baby, I think about you day and night.

30:31.248 --> 30:33.498
I wish I could hold you in my arms.

30:39.548 --> 30:41.298
The door won't open.

30:41.341 --> 30:42.511
I can't get in.

30:42.551 --> 30:45.601
I know, baby.
I'm not allowed to let you in.

30:46.305 --> 30:50.025
It's dark out here. I want to come in.

30:50.058 --> 30:53.228
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

30:53.270 --> 30:57.320
Please, Mommy, open the door.
I want to hug you.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.608
It's okay, baby.

31:00.736 --> 31:03.606
It's okay to cry. Mommy's crying, too.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.584
I have to go now, Mommy.

31:07.618 --> 31:08.618
What?

31:08.660 --> 31:10.540
I have to go back now, Mommy.

31:10.579 --> 31:11.789
No!

31:11.830 --> 31:13.580
No, you just got here.

31:14.291 --> 31:17.591
No, please. Baby, no, don't go.

31:17.628 --> 31:20.668
Don't go. I just want
a few more minutes, okay?

31:20.714 --> 31:22.764
Just a few more minutes, baby.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.299
Please. Please, Oliver!

31:28.472 --> 31:30.312
Where are you?

31:35.312 --> 31:36.402
Ollie?

31:37.814 --> 31:38.984
Oliver!

31:40.526 --> 31:41.736
Oliver!

31:48.825 --> 31:51.075
I love you, baby.

32:54.224 --> 32:55.604
Maria?

32:55.934 --> 32:56.944
Maria?

33:00.230 --> 33:01.310
Maria.

33:14.995 --> 33:16.335
There's nobody out here.

33:24.463 --> 33:27.133
Quiet! Buddy, what's wrong with you?

33:27.174 --> 33:28.224
Relax.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.338
Are you all right?

33:30.427 --> 33:32.297
Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing up?

33:32.846 --> 33:34.256
Is Mommy home?

33:34.723 --> 33:36.473
No, not yet. She will be soon.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.017
Let's get you back to bed. Come on.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.616
How much tea would you like?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.250
The whole glass.

34:49.214 --> 34:51.554
That's not how
you're supposed to drink tea.

34:51.842 --> 34:54.472
You're supposed to drink tea like this.

35:25.792 --> 35:26.792
Khan?

35:28.295 --> 35:30.135
Where did you come from?

36:44.496 --> 36:45.496
Mommy!

36:46.164 --> 36:47.214
Hello.

36:47.666 --> 36:48.786
I missed you so much.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.536
I missed you, too.

36:53.547 --> 36:55.297
Stop it! That tickles!

36:59.344 --> 37:02.144
Lucy, let's get Winston a snack.

37:02.181 --> 37:04.061
- Come.
- Come on, Winston.

37:04.558 --> 37:05.558
Come.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.270
I was worried sick. Where were you?

37:08.312 --> 37:09.942
I was trying to get better.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.440
You couldn't have...

37:11.481 --> 37:13.111
We would have come with you.

37:13.150 --> 37:14.530
I know, I know.

37:21.575 --> 37:23.875
Hey, I'm back.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.996
I'm really back. I'm back for you.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.579
I'm back for Lucy.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.135
What's going on?

39:01.175 --> 39:03.845
It's okay, it's okay. It's just Winston.

39:04.636 --> 39:05.796
I got him.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.193
Come on, you.

39:25.616 --> 39:27.446
Go to bed. Go to bed.

40:02.236 --> 40:03.646
Momma's here now.

41:04.298 --> 41:05.628
Miss Lucy?

41:10.679 --> 41:12.179
Where are you?

41:32.451 --> 41:35.041
Ooh, ooh, my name is

41:35.078 --> 41:37.788
L-I L-I chicka-ni chicka-ni

41:37.831 --> 41:40.541
Ooh, ooh, my name is

41:40.584 --> 41:43.344
L-I L-I chicka-ni chicka-ni

41:43.378 --> 41:45.918
Ooh, ooh, my name is

41:45.964 --> 41:47.924
L-I L-I chicka...

41:49.009 --> 41:50.259
Hello, Mommy.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.309
What you doing in here, Luce?

41:55.807 --> 41:57.927
Just playing with my dolls.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.686
And who were you talking to?

42:01.230 --> 42:02.400
Just my dolls.

42:03.273 --> 42:04.403
Okay.

42:05.442 --> 42:08.532
Well, you know that Momma doesn't like
people playing up here, right?

42:08.570 --> 42:12.570
So how about we go back downstairs?

42:13.283 --> 42:14.283
Okay, Mommy.

42:15.035 --> 42:16.325
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

42:27.172 --> 42:28.512
Mommy, are you coming?

42:28.549 --> 42:30.049
Yeah, I'll be right there, babe.

43:13.177 --> 43:15.387
Miss Lucy, that sounds...

43:38.118 --> 43:39.828
Hey, Luce, where did you get Khan?

43:43.874 --> 43:44.874
Hey.

43:45.876 --> 43:47.786
Hey, look at me, Luce.

43:51.798 --> 43:54.798
I have something to show you,
but it's a secret.

43:55.385 --> 44:00.175
Lucy, I need you to tell me
where you got the tiger, okay?

44:01.683 --> 44:04.523
Did Piki give him to you?

44:05.979 --> 44:07.149
Look, Mommy.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.896
Lucy, please stop.

44:13.529 --> 44:14.609
Lucy.

44:14.655 --> 44:17.495
Lucy, I need to talk to you about...

44:29.586 --> 44:31.756
Oliver's come back, Mommy.

45:08.542 --> 45:10.922
Nighty-night, sleep you tight.

45:10.961 --> 45:14.051
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

45:16.550 --> 45:19.260
You won't tell Daddy, will you?

45:19.720 --> 45:21.100
About Oliver.

45:22.764 --> 45:24.474
Why do you say that, love?

45:27.102 --> 45:29.062
I think Oliver's hiding.

45:30.898 --> 45:32.518
Who's he hiding from?

45:32.566 --> 45:34.396
He doesn't want to tell me.

45:34.443 --> 45:36.153
Just don't tell Daddy.

45:39.489 --> 45:42.949
Well, what if we wait until
Oliver's ready to tell him?

45:43.577 --> 45:45.327
Promise?

45:46.121 --> 45:47.911
Yeah, I promise.

45:49.249 --> 45:50.579
Get some sleep.

45:52.419 --> 45:53.499
I love you.

45:59.468 --> 46:00.678
Good night.

46:44.304 --> 46:45.264
Good night.

46:45.305 --> 46:46.805
Sleep tight.

46:47.516 --> 46:49.636
And don't let the bedbugs bite.

47:26.555 --> 47:27.565
Okay.

47:29.308 --> 47:32.138
Okay, let's see where we left off.

47:41.862 --> 47:43.992
"Directly in front of him...

47:44.031 --> 47:45.991
"holding on by a low branch...

47:46.033 --> 47:49.953
"stood a naked brown baby
who could just barely walk...

47:49.995 --> 47:54.755
"as soft and as dimpled a little atom
as ever came to a wolf's cave at night."

48:17.231 --> 48:18.771
Hey, sweetheart.

48:19.066 --> 48:20.726
I was just coming to find you.

48:20.776 --> 48:22.486
Did I miss saying good night to Luce?

48:22.528 --> 48:24.648
It's okay.
I kissed her good night for you.

48:24.696 --> 48:25.736
Okay.

48:26.448 --> 48:27.618
Sorry I was late.

48:28.116 --> 48:29.276
It's okay.

48:30.118 --> 48:31.698
Are you all right? You're trembling.

48:33.121 --> 48:34.331
I don't know.

48:34.373 --> 48:35.333
What's going on?

48:35.374 --> 48:38.674
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good.

48:38.710 --> 48:40.590
I'm really, really good.

48:42.214 --> 48:43.474
Good.

49:44.985 --> 49:46.195
Hello.

49:47.029 --> 49:48.149
Hello?

49:50.657 --> 49:51.827
Hello?

49:52.701 --> 49:54.451
Oliver, where are you?

50:16.517 --> 50:18.137
What's going on? What happened?

50:18.185 --> 50:19.485
What happened, baby?

50:19.520 --> 50:20.560
Are you all right?

50:20.604 --> 50:22.024
It's a dream. Just a dream.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.320
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

50:26.360 --> 50:27.360
Yeah.

51:24.084 --> 51:25.084
Mommy!

51:27.337 --> 51:28.707
Mommy!

51:30.591 --> 51:31.931
What is it, baby?

51:32.593 --> 51:34.263
Chil and Bill are dead.

51:34.595 --> 51:35.595
What?

51:36.263 --> 51:38.893
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

51:40.434 --> 51:43.524
The gardener found all the fish
dead in the pond.

51:43.562 --> 51:46.112
And all the plants are dying.

51:50.944 --> 51:53.494
Can we bury Chil and Bill in the sea?

51:53.906 --> 51:54.906
In the sea?

51:56.074 --> 51:59.584
Piki said people in India
get buried in the sea.

51:59.620 --> 52:01.200
Of course. Yes, we can.

52:01.246 --> 52:03.086
How about you go get something
to bury them in?

52:13.133 --> 52:15.093
You should have worn white.

52:15.135 --> 52:17.095
I wore a white scarf. That's not enough?

52:17.137 --> 52:18.137
No.

52:18.639 --> 52:21.469
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude
to Chil and Bill.

52:22.476 --> 52:24.476
It's a good spot right here.

52:31.360 --> 52:33.820
Bye-bye, Chil. Bye-bye, Bill.

52:40.118 --> 52:42.118
Mommy, who's that man?

52:44.164 --> 52:45.604
It's all right, baby. He's far away.

52:45.791 --> 52:47.131
Not that man, Mommy!

52:47.167 --> 52:48.167
That man!

53:03.851 --> 53:06.311
Why did that man put ash on your face?

53:06.353 --> 53:07.653
I don't know, love.

53:07.688 --> 53:08.978
Did I get it all?

53:09.022 --> 53:10.022
Yeah, you got it.

53:10.983 --> 53:11.983
Yeah?

53:47.936 --> 53:49.396
Luce stay behind me.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.630
Oliver?

55:03.720 --> 55:05.720
Oliver, do you want to play?

55:12.980 --> 55:17.230
Are you coming out to play, Stanley?

55:17.818 --> 55:19.028
I can't.

55:19.403 --> 55:22.493
Someone painted the wall pink...

55:24.825 --> 55:26.205
I got the blame.

55:34.168 --> 55:37.208
Detective Calamity at your service, sir.

55:38.547 --> 55:40.127
Do we have any clues?

55:40.174 --> 55:41.424
He did it! He did it!

56:04.364 --> 56:05.954
What is it, Winston?

56:07.367 --> 56:09.577
Sounds like you need a detective.

56:23.217 --> 56:24.757
Look at you. Right where you belong.

56:27.387 --> 56:30.387
Okay, baby girl.
Let's get those nits out.

56:31.350 --> 56:33.310
I don't have nits.

56:33.352 --> 56:36.522
Nits like clean hair. Daddy told me.

56:36.563 --> 56:38.983
Okay, well, then you certainly
don't have them, Grumpy-stiltskin.

56:39.024 --> 56:40.074
Turn around.

56:40.609 --> 56:41.649
Turn around.

56:43.195 --> 56:45.205
Come on, come on, come on.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.950
Lucy, what happened to your shoulder?

56:52.371 --> 56:54.911
I don't think I like Oliver anymore.

56:54.957 --> 56:56.327
He's mean.

57:21.066 --> 57:23.606
Oliver, I saw those bite marks on Lucy.

57:24.778 --> 57:27.318
You can't hurt your sister, all right?

57:34.454 --> 57:35.664
I said "no".

57:44.631 --> 57:46.011
Oliver, you let me out.

57:57.728 --> 57:58.898
Okay.

57:59.521 --> 58:00.811
I'll read to you.

58:00.856 --> 58:03.356
As long as you promise
not to hurt Lucy again.

58:06.486 --> 58:07.696
Will you promise me?

58:22.211 --> 58:24.301
"Shere Khan moved through the forest.

58:24.338 --> 58:27.918
"He heard the thunder of their hooves,
and lumbered down the ravine...

58:27.966 --> 58:30.546
"looking from side to side
for any way of escape."

58:44.983 --> 58:45.943
Hello?

58:45.984 --> 58:47.034
Hey, darling.

58:47.069 --> 58:49.649
How was your day?
Did you have fun with Luce?

58:49.696 --> 58:51.356
Yeah, I just put her to bed.

58:51.406 --> 58:52.406
Okay.

58:53.659 --> 58:56.409
I'm really sorry, but I've got to be here
for a couple more hours.

58:56.453 --> 58:59.963
Shall I ask Piki to keep something warm
for you or are you going to eat there?

58:59.998 --> 59:01.208
No, it's okay.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.130
I'm just going to grab something here.

59:03.168 --> 59:06.168
But I just wanted to tell you
that I miss you.

59:06.213 --> 59:07.383
I miss you, too.

59:07.714 --> 59:11.054
All right. I love you.
Give Luce a kiss for me.

59:11.093 --> 59:12.513
Will do. Love you, too.

59:12.553 --> 59:13.643
Bye.

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:32.511
Oliver?

01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:10.004
I see you there.

01:01:12.923 --> 01:01:14.343
I'll call the police!

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:20.012
Go on!

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:25.604
Go. Go!

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.227
Get out! Get out of my house!

01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:13.735
You have no idea what you have done.

01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:20.693
Did you think that you could bring back
somebody from the world of the dead...

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.238
and they would be the same?

01:02:23.493 --> 01:02:25.453
Did you think there would be
no consequences?

01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:27.155
I don't understand.

01:02:27.497 --> 01:02:30.287
Hindus believe in the purification
and reincarnation of the soul.

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.745
That can never happen to Oliver now...

01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:36.455
because he has returned to this life.

01:02:36.507 --> 01:02:39.127
Instead, his soul will putrefy.

01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:40.886
You have seen her, haven't you?

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:42.178
Myrtu.

01:02:42.596 --> 01:02:45.886
She is getting closer to this world
every day.

01:02:45.933 --> 01:02:49.063
When you opened the door, you upset
the balance between life and death...

01:02:49.102 --> 01:02:51.152
and you awoke her.

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:54.018
She is the gatekeeper of the underworld.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:58.155
She is here to take Oliver back
to the world of the dead.

01:02:58.195 --> 01:03:01.745
And she will destroy anything
that comes in her way.

01:03:01.782 --> 01:03:04.412
Oliver is no longer your son,
Mrs. Harwood.

01:03:04.451 --> 01:03:06.951
Do you understand what I am telling you?

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:09.115
He is evil.

01:03:10.624 --> 01:03:14.004
Burn every possession of his.
Destroy every photograph.

01:03:14.044 --> 01:03:17.264
Get rid of anything which is
an anchor for him to this life...

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:19.417
and pray that he will return
to the world of the dead.

01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:20.466
You are out of your mind.

01:03:20.717 --> 01:03:22.967
I should never have told you
about the temple!

01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:27.676
I thought I was trying to help you.

01:03:48.996 --> 01:03:50.156
Lucy?

01:03:57.838 --> 01:03:59.338
Baby.

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:01.127
Hey.

01:04:01.842 --> 01:04:03.132
Are you okay?

01:04:07.472 --> 01:04:08.682
Lucy?

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:11.805
Mommy.

01:04:12.686 --> 01:04:14.846
You woke me up.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:35.708
Are you okay?

01:04:38.337 --> 01:04:39.547
Yes.

01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:43.167
Yes.

01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:45.757
Come on. I've got to get dry.

01:04:57.356 --> 01:04:59.396
I just think it would be
a really good idea.

01:05:00.526 --> 01:05:02.736
I can't remember the last time
Lucy saw her cousins.

01:05:02.778 --> 01:05:03.738
I know.

01:05:03.779 --> 01:05:05.069
It would be amazing.

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.913
I would love that.

01:05:07.616 --> 01:05:10.736
I'm just not sure it's the best timing
for business, but...

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.210
You are always saying that
you never have any time to relax.

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:17.248
You know, she's got a month
before she starts school...

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:22.126
and we haven't been to the States
for so long.

01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:43.152
Are you okay?

01:05:45.279 --> 01:05:47.279
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:47.948 --> 01:05:49.948
Yeah? You seem kind of flushed.

01:05:50.617 --> 01:05:53.447
I'm just coming down with something.
Luce!

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.080
Luce?

01:05:56.123 --> 01:05:57.213
Lucy?

01:05:57.249 --> 01:05:58.459
- Luce?
- Lucy?

01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:00.753
Lucy!

01:06:00.794 --> 01:06:02.034
I'll go look for her out front.

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:03.087
Luce?

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.130
Lucy?

01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:07.588
Mommy!

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:08.644
Lucy!

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.470
Luce!

01:06:21.607 --> 01:06:22.607
Lucy!

01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:24.937
Luce!

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.075
Lucy!

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.248
Mommy!

01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:46.756
Lucy!

01:07:28.048 --> 01:07:29.218
Maria!

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:30.550
Hey.

01:07:40.644 --> 01:07:42.404
Michael! Where were you?

01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.153
She was just out front.
I tried to tell you, but you'd run off.

01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:47.651
I couldn't find you.

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:58.142
I know you're there.

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:09.998
Oliver, stop it!

01:10:59.384 --> 01:11:00.384
Amma.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.113
Amma.

01:11:26.286 --> 01:11:27.616
Anushka?

01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:41.072
Look, Mommy. It's Oliver's book.

01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:42.111
Thank you.

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.376
What is this?

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:56.879
I'm not sure.

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:21.285
Maria? Maria!

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:22.108
Michael!

01:13:22.152 --> 01:13:23.192
What?

01:13:23.237 --> 01:13:24.197
Lucy, come here.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:25.158
Stay there.

01:13:25.197 --> 01:13:27.067
- I got you. It's okay.
- What is it, Mommy?

01:13:27.908 --> 01:13:29.078
It's okay.

01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:22.049
"And when the drawbridge closed
with a bang...

01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:24.707
"all the people were safe inside.

01:14:24.756 --> 01:14:28.386
"And deep in the dark forest
the dragon curled up in a heap...

01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:30.047
"and went to sleep."

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.637
I think you can curl up in a heap
and go to sleep now.

01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:41.649
You don't think that Oliver
did that to Piki, do you?

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:44.567
No.

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:50.487
No, I think what happened to Piki
was just a terrible, terrible accident.

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:52.164
Are you sure?

01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:54.406
Yes, I am.

01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:57.910
Now, how about you hop into bed?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.250
Been a long day, little one.

01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:09.764
Can Winston sleep with me tonight?

01:15:10.802 --> 01:15:12.682
I suppose that's a yes, isn't it?

01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:15.597
Do not hog all the bed.

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:17.853
Have sweet dreams. I love you.

01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:22.305
Is Piki in heaven now?

01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:27.816
I think so, yes.

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:39.791
Why isn't Oliver in heaven?

01:15:46.046 --> 01:15:47.956
It's time for bed, sweet girl.

01:15:48.507 --> 01:15:50.377
I'll see you in the morning.

01:17:08.545 --> 01:17:09.705
Lucy?

01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:12.337
Baby, are you all right?

01:17:15.177 --> 01:17:16.257
Luce?

01:17:21.475 --> 01:17:22.475
Lucy.

01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.438
Lucy.

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:33.069
Lucy?

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:35.316
Luce!

01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:37.823
Lucy!

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:39.989
Lucy!

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:48.464
Lucy!

01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:55.381
Luce?

01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:57.765
Are you in here?

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:59.513
Baby, are you hiding from...

01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:01.015
No, no, no.

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:02.716
No, no!

01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:28.921
Lucy?

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:32.421
Luce.

01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:35.882
Oh, my God, sweet girl. You scared me.

01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:37.931
So much.

01:18:40.012 --> 01:18:41.722
What are you doing out here, baby?

01:18:41.763 --> 01:18:44.023
I wanted to feel the wind on my skin.

01:18:44.057 --> 01:18:45.267
It tickles.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:47.980
Okay.

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:50.607
Okay, come on, let's go to bed.

01:18:59.364 --> 01:19:01.834
Hey, guys. What's going on?

01:19:02.576 --> 01:19:03.616
Daddy!

01:19:04.036 --> 01:19:05.076
Hey, you.

01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:07.874
What are you doing out here
so late, pumpkin?

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.515
I think
she might have been sleepwalking.

01:19:12.294 --> 01:19:13.804
I missed you, Daddy.

01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:18.218
I missed you, too, sweetheart.

01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:22.221
How about we get you back to bed?
Come on.

01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:24.603
I love you, Daddy.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.020
I love you, too...

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600
What...

01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:30.021
What?

01:19:30.062 --> 01:19:31.192
- Michael.
- No, no, no.

01:19:32.856 --> 01:19:34.066
Michael.

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.693
No. No!

01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:41.033
Michael.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:54.002
It's got to burn. It's got to burn.

01:19:54.044 --> 01:19:56.634
What? Why?

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.010
Because Oliver came back.

01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:04.764
What?

01:20:05.013 --> 01:20:07.393
Oliver came back,
and I think he killed Piki.

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:10.232
Because she tried to burn
all of his things to send him back...

01:20:10.269 --> 01:20:11.729
because he's not our boy anymore.

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:13.060
Stop.

01:20:14.273 --> 01:20:15.483
Darling, stop.

01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:17.444
I know it sounds absolutely crazy,
but it's true.

01:20:17.818 --> 01:20:19.528
Right, Luce? Right?

01:20:20.988 --> 01:20:23.618
I don't know
what you're talking about, Mommy.

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:26.327
No, no, baby, it's okay. It's okay.

01:20:26.368 --> 01:20:27.738
We can tell Daddy now.

01:20:27.786 --> 01:20:29.786
Tell him about your brother.
Tell him about the piano.

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:31.460
Tell him about the piano.

01:20:32.457 --> 01:20:35.707
I don't know what you're saying.
Oliver's dead.

01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:39.258
Luce, I don't know why you're doing this
right now, okay?

01:20:39.298 --> 01:20:41.218
But you need to
tell your father the truth.

01:20:41.258 --> 01:20:42.678
You need to tell him.

01:20:43.135 --> 01:20:44.895
I don't know what you mean, Mommy.

01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:46.178
Lucy, you have to tell him!

01:20:46.221 --> 01:20:48.261
Enough! Enough!

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:51.520
You're scaring her.

01:20:52.686 --> 01:20:55.516
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...

01:21:01.528 --> 01:21:02.818
It's all right.

01:21:02.863 --> 01:21:04.913
Let's get you to bed, sweetheart.

01:21:05.949 --> 01:21:07.119
All right.

01:21:09.745 --> 01:21:11.295
You feel better, poppet?

01:21:11.622 --> 01:21:13.292
Now that you're here, Daddy.

01:21:16.877 --> 01:21:19.247
You sleep well, okay? I love you.

01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:20.506
I love you, too.

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:22.377
Lucy, please tell Daddy about Oliver.

01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:25.844
Maria, sweetheart,
you're not thinking straight.

01:21:25.886 --> 01:21:27.546
- Can we talk about this downstairs?
- I'm not making it up.

01:21:27.596 --> 01:21:30.716
I understand you don't think
you're making it up, but I...

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:34.940
What?

01:21:38.232 --> 01:21:39.822
Oliver, what have you done?

01:21:45.155 --> 01:21:46.195
Maria?

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.620
He's possessed her.

01:21:47.658 --> 01:21:49.198
Maria, would you listen to yourself?

01:21:49.243 --> 01:21:50.493
No, no, no!

01:21:51.578 --> 01:21:52.788
Oliver?

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:56.001
Maria.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:58.461
We can be together again.

01:21:58.502 --> 01:22:00.092
You leave your sister alone!

01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:01.548
Daddy, I'm scared!

01:22:01.588 --> 01:22:02.588
Stop!

01:22:07.803 --> 01:22:09.053
Come here, sweetheart.

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:10.466
It's going to be all right.

01:22:10.514 --> 01:22:11.814
Michael.

01:22:12.933 --> 01:22:14.143
You need help.

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:17.144
I'm going to get you the help you need,
and everything is going to be okay.

01:22:22.943 --> 01:22:25.493
Okay. Are you all right, sweetheart?

01:22:25.529 --> 01:22:26.819
Mommy was hurting me.

01:22:26.864 --> 01:22:29.124
No, no.
Mommy's just not herself right now.

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:30.987
But she loves you very much.

01:22:31.368 --> 01:22:32.788
And so do I.

01:22:33.871 --> 01:22:35.291
Where are we going?

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:37.170
We're going on a little adventure.

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:50.796
What do you want?

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.400
Okay.

01:23:07.863 --> 01:23:10.423
Just stay here. I'm going to make
a quick call, okay, sweetheart?

01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.661
Everything's going to be fine.

01:23:14.161 --> 01:23:15.201
Okay.

01:23:15.495 --> 01:23:16.575
Come on.

01:23:18.749 --> 01:23:19.869
Come on.

01:23:40.187 --> 01:23:41.267
Hello. Hi.

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:49.740
Yes, okay, my address is Dobra Villa,
satrah, Carter Road, in Bandra.

01:23:50.072 --> 01:23:52.822
Yes, there's a group of men
outside my house...

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:55.536
and I think they're trying to break in
and get my daughter...

01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:57.759
I'm not sure,
but I need help immediately.

01:23:58.872 --> 01:24:00.042
Bad dog.

01:24:00.874 --> 01:24:02.044
Yes. Yes.

01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:03.746
As fast as you can.

01:24:05.254 --> 01:24:06.504
Quiet.

01:24:06.547 --> 01:24:09.217
I don't know, but they're naked almost.

01:24:09.258 --> 01:24:10.758
Okay, please hurry. Yes.

01:24:14.888 --> 01:24:16.388
Lucy, what...

01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:21.480
Oh, my God. Baby.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.610
What did you do?

01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:27.532
Winston was being naughty.

01:24:27.568 --> 01:24:29.398
So I had to teach him a lesson.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.380
You're not going to be naughty
as well...

01:24:33.407 --> 01:24:35.077
are you, Daddy?

01:24:36.159 --> 01:24:37.159
No!

01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:40.411
It's just Mommy and me now.

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:51.377
I'm sorry, Daddy.

01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:53.595
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:24:57.472 --> 01:24:59.932
You're making a mess
all over the kitchen floor.

01:24:59.975 --> 01:25:01.735
Mommy will be mad.

01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:05.229
Lucy, what are you doing?

01:25:05.731 --> 01:25:07.611
I'm not Lucy. I'm Oliver.

01:25:08.483 --> 01:25:09.943
No.

01:25:10.277 --> 01:25:11.777
But I am!

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:46.193
Michael?

01:26:13.799 --> 01:26:14.839
Michael.

01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:25.481
Michael?

01:26:42.077 --> 01:26:43.367
Oliver!

01:26:50.878 --> 01:26:52.748
Help me, Mommy!
Help me, Mommy!

01:26:53.046 --> 01:26:54.336
Leave her alone!

01:26:58.093 --> 01:26:59.183
Lucy!

01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:00.509
- Mommy.
- Lucy!

01:27:00.554 --> 01:27:01.554
Baby!

01:27:03.056 --> 01:27:04.056
Luce!

01:27:11.773 --> 01:27:12.773
Lucy!

01:27:43.639 --> 01:27:44.969
No!

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.310
Lucy!

01:27:50.479 --> 01:27:51.479
No!

01:27:54.983 --> 01:27:57.403
Oliver, you leave Lucy
and you come to me.

01:27:57.986 --> 01:27:59.946
You come to me. Do you hear me?

01:27:59.988 --> 01:28:01.238
I don't want to go back.

01:28:01.281 --> 01:28:03.621
I know. I know. But I'll go with you.

01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.294
All right?

01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:14.424
You'll be safe. You're safe.
I've got you. I've got you.

01:28:25.597 --> 01:28:27.267
Take me instead.

01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:29.478
No!

01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:33.855
No! No!

01:28:34.314 --> 01:28:35.324
Maria!

01:28:36.817 --> 01:28:38.107
No!

01:28:38.986 --> 01:28:40.316
Let me go!

01:30:09.743 --> 01:30:10.793

01:30:19.962 --> 01:30:21.422
Mommy!

Michael?

01:30:40.774 --> 01:30:42.904
Maria, can you hear me?

01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:45.107
Michael, where are you?

01:30:45.821 --> 01:30:47.411
I'm right here, sweetheart.

01:30:48.574 --> 01:30:50.244
I can't believe I can hear your voice.

01:30:51.577 --> 01:30:52.657
Sweetheart?

01:30:54.329 --> 01:30:55.329
Maria?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.250

01:31:04.631 --> 01:31:06.591

- Please, I need to see you.
- Michael.

01:31:08.927 --> 01:31:09.967
I need to see your face.
