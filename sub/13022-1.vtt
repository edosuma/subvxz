WEBVTT

02:16.886 --> 02:20.806
When I was 11,
rabies went around.

02:38.700 --> 02:44.955
My dog caught rabies
and bit its mother to death,

02:45.081 --> 02:49.459
then it killed anything
it could bite.

02:50.253 --> 02:56.383
When the neighbours tried
to beat it to death, it ran away.

02:56.467 --> 02:59.511
- West wind kong.
- And chow.

03:00.305 --> 03:04.057
It's outside hand at 4 points.
You got 16 points.

03:06.686 --> 03:11.231
Days later, it came back,
skinny and pitiful as ever.

03:12.442 --> 03:16.236
There was nothing
behind its dark eyes,

03:16.321 --> 03:20.782
it looked at me for a while
then slowly lay on the ground and died.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.079
I buried the dog
behind our neighbourhood,

03:26.998 --> 03:31.919
but the elders dug it up that night
and it was devoured.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.008
Red dragon kong.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.186
I got double kong.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.689
Double kong? Hold on.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.902
Kong and...

03:57.820 --> 03:59.696
...chow.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.532
You lost again.

04:04.410 --> 04:08.080
Why am I doing so well?
Are you my lucky charm?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.791
- Kong, chow...
- What the hell?

04:10.875 --> 04:12.918
Chow, 16 points and 32...

04:14.128 --> 04:17.089
Hey, you still owe me more.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.426
Who the fuck is that?

04:30.561 --> 04:33.230
The reason why I thought of it

04:33.314 --> 04:37.901
was because the rabies
that vanished had come back.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.544
It's going around.

04:57.088 --> 05:00.340
THE YELLOW SEA

05:05.096 --> 05:10.809
The Cab Driver

05:16.607 --> 05:18.984
Yanji, Yanbian region, China

06:35.686 --> 06:37.354
What time did you get in?

06:39.565 --> 06:43.235
I said, what time did you get in?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.988
Four...

06:47.073 --> 06:49.074
Did you play mahjong again?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.536
I told you to cut that shit out.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.415
Let me remind you again.

06:56.541 --> 07:03.046
Even if I sell your eyes, guts,
and your daughter to a sleazy pimp,

07:03.131 --> 07:06.591
it still won't cover your debt.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.552
So if you're like this...

07:08.678 --> 07:10.095
I'm sorry.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.596
Sorry?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.267
You're sorry?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.525
Is 60,000 yuan a joke?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.610
You're going to pay it off
by playing mahjong?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.951
Hey, asshole!

07:34.036 --> 07:36.371
Don't wash, just go.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.752
Go make some money.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.765
Son of a bitch!

08:54.492 --> 08:56.201
Goddammit.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.456
Ma'am!

09:03.251 --> 09:05.085
- Ma'am!
- Go away, I'm done with you.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.170
Check for me.
I'm sure it's in.

09:07.255 --> 09:11.007
Your wife's cheating on you.
Why would she send you money?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.093
Do you not want to work anymore?

09:13.177 --> 09:14.678
OK, fine.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.599
Yappy bastard! So annoying.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.814
Yeah, can you check for any deposits
from Korea?

09:25.898 --> 09:29.109
Kim Gu-nam.
It should be from Lee Hwa-ja.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.028
Nothing? Got it.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.241
- It's not in.
- Are you sure?

09:36.367 --> 09:39.286
Why would I cheat you about deposits?

09:42.123 --> 09:44.374
Many become whores after crossing.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.377
Just think of her as dead
and stop coming here.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.712
Watch your mouth!

09:52.466 --> 09:54.426
Stupid bastard.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.735
Son-in-law, I'm sorry.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.585
Pay up.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.387
Hey, hey?

11:21.972 --> 11:23.640
No money?

11:25.309 --> 11:28.228
Boss, this guy's done,
get us another.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.147
Not leaving?

11:32.775 --> 11:35.819
Go away, you fucking Joseonjok!

11:35.945 --> 11:37.278
Get the fuck out!

12:19.447 --> 12:21.448
Fucking whore.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.934
Had a bad dream?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.232
Dreams are supposed to be
the opposite.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.360
There's good news.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.739
You've got a saviour.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.264
Mr Myun!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.897
Mr Myun! Been well?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.900
Come on. This guy here is...

13:38.984 --> 13:40.276
I got it. Go on.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.656
Go and wait.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.533
I'll send him back when I'm done.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.676
Fucking lowlifes.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.639
Do you know who I am?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.518
I'm Myun, good to see you.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.234
What a hand...

14:29.577 --> 14:30.910
Have you eaten?

14:32.746 --> 14:34.038
Let's go and eat.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.771
I heard you lost contact
with your wife in Korea.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.858
And you're left to repay the debt
for her visa.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.988
60,000 yuan?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.870
Those fucking losers charged 60?

15:15.623 --> 15:21.377
You must want to kill your wife.
It's obvious she's cheating on you.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.383
Hey, hey!
Hear me out before you go.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.680
Sit, come and sit.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.565
What a character...

15:43.567 --> 15:46.027
Bad temper, but not a goon.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.364
Always get beaten,
but don't look pitiful.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.032
Strange.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.911
Name's Gu-nam, right?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.287
Yeah.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.253
Gu-nam...

16:06.256 --> 16:08.925
Go and kill someone in Korea for me.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.931
You think this is a joke?

16:15.849 --> 16:18.559
You can never repay your debt here.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.230
Do you want to live like those dogs
all your life?

16:26.944 --> 16:31.572
Go and see your wife, too.
You can bring her back or kill her.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.617
Just go and do the job.

16:34.743 --> 16:37.120
And start your life over.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.794
I knew you couldn't make up
your mind.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.299
Call me soon,
before I find someone else.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.003
Cleaning chicken shit?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.882
Hi, sweetheart!

17:31.008 --> 17:33.176
Seung-hee, Daddy's here!

17:37.765 --> 17:40.975
Sweetheart, eat.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.942
Her mother still hasn't called?

17:52.029 --> 17:55.114
I knew she wasn't right
from the way she looked.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.241
Eyes all slit up,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.870
she looked like a whore
who needs to screw every day.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.914
Have you gone mad?
Watch your mouth.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.001
Not in front of the kid.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.880
Your eyes are slit up too.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.049
You're a real bastard.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.887
Make some money and go to Korea.

18:17.971 --> 18:22.642
Find a good wife there
and have a new life together.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.894
I'll raise her so don't worry.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.292
You're here.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.465
Memorise it.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.474
All of it.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.770
Recite it.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.858
Seoul, Gangnam Nonhyun 99-1,
Kim Seung-hyun.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.860
Don't forget it.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.029
If you forget,
your family's all dead.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.546
There's 3,000 yuan.
About $500.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.466
It should be enough in Korea.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.969
Take it.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.976
There's 57,000 yuan.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.688
I'll give you the pin number
after the job. It'll be yours. Good?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.361
Ah, one more thing,
you have to bring me his finger.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.696
The thumb.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.616
Got it.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.651
Have a good trip!

21:34.418 --> 21:37.336
Dalian, China

23:45.757 --> 23:47.591
Everyone! Wake up!

23:47.717 --> 23:49.218
Get up! Hurry!

23:49.344 --> 23:52.221
Hey, wake up!

23:52.305 --> 23:53.389
Hurry up!

23:53.974 --> 23:55.099
Wake up!

23:55.684 --> 23:58.352
Get out! Hurry up!

23:59.229 --> 24:02.773
Quickly! Up, up!

24:02.899 --> 24:05.568
Get out fast! Out! Quick!

24:11.408 --> 24:13.742
Jump, you bitch!

24:22.169 --> 24:24.211
- Done?
- Go! Go!

24:49.821 --> 24:55.451
The Killer

24:59.206 --> 25:01.999
Ulsan, South Korea

25:23.104 --> 25:26.565
Ulju Seafood

25:58.098 --> 25:59.890
Damn lighter.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.353
Give me that light.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.869
Hey, give me the note.

26:30.755 --> 26:34.216
It's the boat back with the date.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.051
Exactly 10 days later.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.638
January 16.
Incheon 472-1 Haechun Inn

26:41.433 --> 26:43.976
It won't wait for you.

26:44.060 --> 26:49.732
Also, I don't know why you're here,
but wear a cap.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.400
You stand out.

26:54.070 --> 26:56.780
Ulsan Bus Terminal

27:06.750 --> 27:09.710
Seoul, South Korea

27:29.773 --> 27:32.149
Seoul, Gangnam

27:33.485 --> 27:38.155
99-1, Kim Seung-hyun.

27:49.376 --> 27:50.376
Nonhyundong 99-1

28:03.848 --> 28:04.682
Mr Kim Seung-hyun

28:04.808 --> 28:06.308
Kim Seung-hyun...

31:29.929 --> 31:32.973
Watch Repair

31:36.019 --> 31:37.853
Ansan Station

31:40.398 --> 31:42.566
- Lamb skewer.
- Beer?

31:44.402 --> 31:45.944
Miss?

31:47.071 --> 31:48.822
Do you...

31:51.993 --> 31:54.328
...know this woman?

31:54.412 --> 31:56.705
I don't know.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.708
I heard she worked here,
about a year ago.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.211
I'm not sure.
Ask the owner when he gets in.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.552
She left, after a month...or two?

32:10.678 --> 32:13.096
I think she said
she was going to Garibong.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.182
- Where?
- Seoul, Garibong.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.226
- Whereabouts?
- Who knows.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.897
I doubt she'll still be there though.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.816
Why? Can't get in touch?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.113
Hey, come closer.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.911
How many couples here,
you think are married?

32:36.037 --> 32:41.208
Forget her. Orjust ignore it.
Don't cause trouble.

32:41.292 --> 32:44.753
Joseonjoks get deported right away.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.505
Make some money quietly and leave.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.771
Good work today!
See you all tomorrow!

33:22.834 --> 33:25.669
- Take care.
- Good night!

34:33.862 --> 34:35.197
You surprised me.

34:37.449 --> 34:39.909
Where did you come from?

34:43.456 --> 34:45.748
I said where?

34:45.875 --> 34:48.543
I, uh...floor two.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.922
Then why did you take
the elevator down?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.594
Joseonjok?

35:02.600 --> 35:07.854
- Who are you?
- Let him be. He's a Joseonjok.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.483
Don't stay here because it's cold.
Got it?

35:11.567 --> 35:12.943
Yeah.

35:18.407 --> 35:19.449
Hey!

35:22.662 --> 35:24.454
Come here.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.832
Come.

35:29.710 --> 35:33.421
If you need a place to stay,
go to the sauna over there.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.258
Take it.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.426
Here.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.018
Get the shutter.

36:32.356 --> 36:35.483
3:10. 2:10, 3:10.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.862
2:10, 3:10.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.241
2:10, the bar.

36:43.326 --> 36:46.453
3:10, shutter down.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.497
Lights...driver.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.584
2:10, the bar.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.379
Kim Seung-hyun...

38:31.809 --> 38:33.768
Shit.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.380
Ah, the thumb.

39:07.511 --> 39:11.181
Finger, thumb.
Thumb, finger.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.715
Garibong Street Market

39:47.551 --> 39:50.512
- Do you know this woman?
- I don't know her.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.974
Go straight and you'll see
the alley to the bars.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.444
I haven't seen her.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.573
I don't know.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.092
- Please come in.
- I'm looking for someone.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.265
I know her. Isn't it Hwa-ja?

40:35.975 --> 40:41.396
There was a regular customer,
he delivered fish to the sushi place.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.315
They were real close,
like brother and sister.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.529
Then he said there was an opening
at a sushi place in Gangnam,

40:49.613 --> 40:52.240
so she left.

40:52.324 --> 40:55.076
He comes around frequently,
so ask him yourself.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.619
What's his name?

40:56.745 --> 41:00.707
Don't know. But look for a white truck.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.709
A truck with a fish tank.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.712
Were they lovers?

41:07.214 --> 41:08.923
Who knows.

41:51.091 --> 41:52.634
Hey.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.262
Yes?

42:00.392 --> 42:01.809
You know this woman?

42:02.561 --> 42:04.812
Yeah, but why?

42:14.657 --> 42:16.991
Where is she?

42:17.076 --> 42:19.702
- Do you know where she is?
- Yes, yes, yes...

43:46.248 --> 43:47.415
Who are you?

43:47.499 --> 43:50.877
The woman next door.
Do you know where she went?

43:52.171 --> 43:55.214
She had a big fight with some guy.
They're not in?

43:55.924 --> 43:59.552
- When was that?
- Not long ago. About an hour?

44:00.679 --> 44:04.641
An hour...
Did you see the man's face?

44:04.767 --> 44:07.685
Of course not. Who are you?

45:12.668 --> 45:14.335
Mokpo Seafood Distribution

45:14.420 --> 45:18.506
The number you've reached
is not in service...

45:27.891 --> 45:29.350
Myun Jung-hak
139-0448-7262

45:45.200 --> 45:47.618
- Yes?
- Mr Myun, it's Gu-nam.

45:47.703 --> 45:51.789
Oh, Gu-nam.
How's the job going?

45:52.458 --> 45:54.751
Sir, something came up.

45:54.877 --> 45:58.379
About the boat back.
Could you extend the date?

45:58.505 --> 46:00.381
What are you talking about?

46:00.507 --> 46:04.051
The boat is leaving tomorrow.
Maybe just 2 extra days.

46:04.136 --> 46:07.638
- Is something distracting you?
- It's not that...

46:07.723 --> 46:10.725
I'm not in charge of the boat.
Just get the job done.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.852
Or you know what'll happen.

46:12.936 --> 46:17.148
I'm sending someone to your mother's,
think carefully now.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.317
Mr Myun?

46:30.078 --> 46:31.579
Who is it?

46:33.540 --> 46:37.585
Sir, let me ask you a favour.

46:38.462 --> 46:42.381
If the woman next door,
or even the man,

46:42.466 --> 46:45.426
whoever comes,
please don't let them leave.

46:45.511 --> 46:51.265
I'll be back by 4:00am,
just until then.

47:46.363 --> 47:48.823
- Have a good night!
- See you tomorrow!

55:24.946 --> 55:27.948
You son of a bitch! Stop right there!
I said stop, son of a bitch!

55:28.033 --> 55:31.118
Over here! He's over there!

57:45.211 --> 57:46.587
Over there!

58:13.948 --> 58:21.079
Joseonjok

58:45.271 --> 58:47.189
Yes?

58:47.315 --> 58:48.899
Yeah...

58:57.242 --> 59:00.994
...please report it
to the nearest police station.

59:02.038 --> 59:06.333
Asian Games judo silver medallist
Professor Kim Seung-hyun

59:06.417 --> 59:10.629
was viciously murdered at his home.

59:10.713 --> 59:15.592
Three men were seen scouting
the building in the past few days.

59:15.677 --> 59:19.513
Police are suspecting a contract kill

59:19.597 --> 59:23.850
based on the professor's missing thumb.

59:23.935 --> 59:29.898
The police are in searching
for the suspect who fled the scene.

59:44.497 --> 59:47.040

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.649
Myun Jung-hak

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:15.235
The number you've reached
is not in service.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.335
Hello? It's Gu-nam.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:37.883
I can't get in touch
with Mr Myun you introduced.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.926
Hello? Hello?

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.126
Boss, it's me.

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:16.546
Who's at the driver's place?

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.803
Shit, just drive.

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:25.013
All right.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.527
Do you know the man who got away?

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:39.986
No...

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:44.241
- Not going to look for him?
- We will.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:47.869
"We will"?

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:55.335
Asshole, this is unacceptable.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.337
I should fucking kill you.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.214
Hey.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.302
Hey!

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.679
Sir.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:09.391
I don't care how much it costs,
find that son of a bitch.

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:12.728
- Before the cops do.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.604
And after you find him...

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.443
...kill him.

01:02:25.324 --> 01:02:27.826
Lower it. Lower.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.377
Manager? Manager!

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:38.712
Yeah?

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.965
- Sir, was there anything missing?
- About $200 from the drawer...

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:44.384
Was there any uniform missing?

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:56.646
Hwasung City

01:02:57.857 --> 01:02:58.607
Hwasung

01:03:01.235 --> 01:03:02.402
One ticket for Hwasung.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.977
You fucking bitch!
Who do you think I am?

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:39.606
You're fucking dead!

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:41.191
You're dead. Come out!

01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:43.068
You are dead today!
Come here!

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.945
Fucking come here!

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.648
- What's the sound of a car?
- Broom-broom.

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.528
- Should we sing a lullaby for Teddy?
- Yes.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.615
Are you sleepy too?

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:51.219
Excuse me.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:09.195
Excuse me, this is a security check.
Could you show me your ID?

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:16.244
Sir?

01:05:22.209 --> 01:05:23.752
You! Don't move!

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.545
Freeze!

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:29.174
Stop right there! I'll shoot!
Goddammit!

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:33.470
Shit, stay where you are.
Don't move.

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:36.723
- Hong-sik, hold him down!
- Don't move!

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:40.435
I'm getting the cuffs!
I've got them, I've got them!

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.399
Hong-sik! Just a moment!
Hold him down!

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.276
Let him go!

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.489
- Shoot him! Shoot!
- Hong-sik, hold him!

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.532
Let him go!

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.912
Just shoot!

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:03.291
Hong-sik! Hong-sik!

01:06:05.294 --> 01:06:06.795
Hong-sik!

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.254
What's wrong?

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:12.425
Hong-sik! Did you get hit?

01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:13.927
Are you hit?

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.138
You son of a bitch!

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.648
Stop right there!

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.277
I said stop!

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:32.612
You're dead!

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:02.267
Hong-sik! Hong-sik!

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.437
You said to shoot,
but why did you get hit?

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.939
Fucking idiots.

01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:15.113
Who are they?

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:29.687
Professor's killer is Joseonjok.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:34.234
The driver hired a cheap Joseonjok
to get a larger cut.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:37.069
Or maybe you did.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.700
- Did you do it?
- Of course not, sir.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.370
Then that driver did it?

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.415
Yes, I believe so.

01:08:54.087 --> 01:08:55.587
Fucking moron.

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:02.428
It's obvious he'll flee the country,
round up those Joseonjoks,

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:04.805
and find out which boat he'll take.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:07.350
- Yes, sir.
- Cops aren't stupid.

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.352
They'll get him
before he gets on the boat.

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:12.856
- Kill him before then. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.453
- It's Sang-chun.
- Call him.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.874
Yes, sir, I got it.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.879
Grab that fuck!

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:33.937
Get started.

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:40.735
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:50.620
Fuck!

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.546
Bring the boss.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:31.536
That Joseonjok,
looks like he was smuggled in.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.747
After all this mess,
that's all you've got to report?

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.916
And?

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:41.713
There's a broker who handles this work.
He must have helped for sure.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.299
- Where's the broker?
- There isn't one in Korea.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:46.217
Is that all?

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.765
There used to be a couple of them,

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:55.768
but now there's only one in Yanji,
named Myun, a Joseonjok.

01:11:55.894 --> 01:11:58.021
His real name is Myun...

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.485
Myun... What was it?

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:07.196
Ah, Jung-hak.
It's Myun Jung-hak.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:09.407
If we eliminate the broker,

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:13.161
we remove the central figure
of this incident.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.955
- Even if the Joseonjok is captured...
- Myun Jung-hak?

01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:17.832
Yes, sir.

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.418
Are you sure about this?

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:23.087
These people don't know
the Joseonjok,

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.964
so it'd mean he was smuggled in.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:28.509
It's 100% certain Myun sent him.

01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:34.766
Then go to Yanji
and get this Myun Jung-hak.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.018
- Get him and...
- I'll take care of him.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:02.043
Ulju Seafood

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.489
...no evidence thus far to pinpoint
his whereabouts.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:37.620
Due to the harsh terrain and
the many roads to neighbouring areas,

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:41.874
the suspect may have slipped
through the police barricade already.

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:48.840
Body parts were discovered
in Garibong this morning.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:54.262
The body inside the bag is presumed
to be of a female Joseonjok.

01:13:55.013 --> 01:14:01.644
A Joseonjok resident discovered
an abandoned bag near his home.

01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:06.232
He found the body parts in the bag
and contacted the police.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:12.113
The neck and arms were severed,
and the victim is in her early 30's.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:16.534
Also, it was discovered
in a Joseonjok community,

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:20.913
and she may be one as well.

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.318
Magic Castle Bar

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.967
Yanji, China

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.269
Welcome.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.357
How can I help you?

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.025
Give me a room.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:35.613
OK, just a moment.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:45.081
- Is there a suite?
- There is, but it's currently occupied.

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:47.875
By Myun Jung-hak?

01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:49.835
No need to be surprised.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:57.385
Want to earn some cash?

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.242
Who are you?

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.798
Get me a towel.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.103
It's done,
what should we do with them?

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.106
Toss the heads and
feed the rest to the dogs.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:45.451
Your boss's name is Kim Tae-won?

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.039
Mr Kim Tae-won...

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:56.504
Perhaps too late?
There's no answer.

01:18:12.562 --> 01:18:14.146
Goddamn idiot.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:18.442
- Any calls from Choi?
- No, sir.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:20.569
That bastard...

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.113
Lexy Massage Parlour

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.366
- An office?
- Full of gangsters, obviously.

01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.535
Here he comes.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.542
So, is it confirmed?

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:38.170
Yes. It's under someone else's name
but it's Kim Seung-hyun's.

01:18:38.296 --> 01:18:41.173
So Kim owned
a total of seven businesses.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:44.343
Four massage parlours
and three salons.

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:49.932
Wasn't he a professor?
Gangster, no doubt.

01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:53.185
Busan, South Korea

01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:02.278
Magic Castle Bar

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.028
Why did you do it?
Was it because of money?

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:47.656
I don't know.
Mr Myun told us...

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:53.829
- Call Myun Jung-hak now!
- We just did what he told us to do!

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.380
Do I look like a fucking cockroach?

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:07.176
How could you do this to me?

01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:17.269
I apologise for the mess.

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:21.857
The suspect popped up in Busan,
it's really nuts here.

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:25.277
We did some research.

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.113
Professor Kim was quite
a figurehead in the underworld.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:33.911
- I was told you two were quite close.
- Yes.

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.454
What's your relation?

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.750
You know, we were like brothers.

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:43.212
Hell of a brother.

01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:50.302
You heard that the suspect fled
the security check a few days ago?

01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:51.679
Yes.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:56.600
We spotted your company cars
and your employees.

01:21:00.647 --> 01:21:04.108
We dug deeper and noticed
that you invested in Professor Kim.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.319
A little.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:16.328
Are you...
looking for the suspect?

01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:42.021
- Still can't reach Choi?
- No, sir.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.274
Even his boys?

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.737
Sons of bitches.

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.656
I'm going nuts here.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.367
Should I drive you home?

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:58.829
Go to Joo-young's.

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:41.789
Doesn't it bother you at all?

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:43.832
What?

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.711
You were close to the professor.

01:22:57.347 --> 01:22:59.932
Why did you do it?

01:23:17.283 --> 01:23:18.742
Choi

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:21.245
Where are you?

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.955
Mr Kim Tae-won?

01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:24.456
Who is this?

01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:29.545
I'm Myun from Yanji.
You know who I am.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:37.302
Hello?

01:23:38.513 --> 01:23:39.763
Yes?

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:44.268
I just arrived in Seoul with Choi.
Let's meet. How's tonight?

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:47.396
Are you listening?

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:51.525
Is he deaf? Hello?

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:53.861
Hello?

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:57.364
Is Choi with you?

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:01.618
What the fuck? Take this.

01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:03.996
Come on!

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.791
Yes, boss...

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:11.170
What the hell...are you doing?

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:14.631
We...just arrived at the airport.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:19.178
What a spineless bastard.
Give it back!

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:24.725
Mr Kim? I'm sending Choi over,
listen to what he says and call me.

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:27.853
You got it or not?

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:34.193
Is this guy retarded?
Hey, Kim Tae-won!

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:39.531
What a motherfucker.

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:43.035
Hey, Mr Myun!

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.870
You're here!

01:24:44.954 --> 01:24:47.372
- Nice to see you
- It's been so long.

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:54.421
What's wrong?

01:24:58.718 --> 01:25:01.512
Tell him exactly what I said.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:06.058
Don't get any ideas,
I'll spread the rumours. Got it?

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:07.559
Yes.

01:25:25.036 --> 01:25:27.704
I sent the money.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:38.632
Yeah, it's me.
The money's sent so check it.

01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:42.761
2:00am? Got it.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.269
How is this going to work?

01:25:50.895 --> 01:25:52.312
Spill it.

01:25:52.438 --> 01:25:57.943
It's to Dalian, China.
2:00am at Busan Harbour, pier 6.

01:25:58.027 --> 01:25:59.987
Tonight?

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.115
That's it?

01:26:08.204 --> 01:26:10.664
Ah, good evening!

01:26:14.085 --> 01:26:15.627
May I sit here?

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.969
What a handsome boss.

01:26:25.638 --> 01:26:28.432
Have you heard my proposal?

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:32.853
And?

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.983
As you know, Mr Kim,

01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:42.029
I have a hand in trafficking boats
between Korea and China.

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:46.200
I saw it in the news
that Gu-nam's in Busan.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.535
Why else would he be there?

01:26:48.661 --> 01:26:51.955
He can't get past me.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.004
All right, go ahead then.

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.964
Yeah?

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.550
Proceed?

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.596
But I'll split the payment.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.558
30 grand up front,
and rest when the job's done.

01:27:11.684 --> 01:27:14.561
Ah...why would you do this?

01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:16.980
- That's the deal.
- What if you say otherwise then?

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.816
You know our situation,
it won't happen.

01:27:22.862 --> 01:27:25.280
I'll proceed with your trust.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:27.991
- Very well.
- Good.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:31.703
Here, we're family now.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:38.210
I'm sorry about your employees
the other day...

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.170
Not another word.

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.884
Is that him?

01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:48.845
He looks good...

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.768
Boss.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.856
Yeah, Mr Park?
It's me, Myun.

01:28:01.567 --> 01:28:06.071
Are you in Busan?
I need to see you right away.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:08.907
I'm here in Korea.

01:28:14.205 --> 01:28:16.415
Why is this asshole not answering?

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:24.131
It's me. Why isn't Young-bae
answering? His phone's on.

01:28:24.882 --> 01:28:26.675
Look into it.

01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:29.761
- Not answering, right?
- Looks like it.

01:28:29.887 --> 01:28:32.764
When Gu-nam arrived,
where's the place you kept him?

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:36.476
- Ulsan. Why?
- Take me there.

01:28:38.771 --> 01:28:42.774
...the tension will rise even higher
among politicians.

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.111
A suspect ofthe Garibong murder
was identified

01:28:46.195 --> 01:28:49.740
as a seafood distributor
in his 40's.

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:53.160
The victim was identified
as a Joseonjok in her early 30's.

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:58.957
The arrest was made today,
and the police are questioning him.

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:04.129
The suspect is said
to have confessed to the crime.

01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:08.800
The murder is reported
to be a crime of passion.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:16.224
We lived together. I got her the job
and gave her some extra money.

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:20.395
But she wanted to go back to China

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.441
to meet her husband.
I was drunk and just lost it...

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:26.026
Mokpo Seafoods

01:29:26.152 --> 01:29:27.694
How do you feel now?

01:29:29.989 --> 01:29:31.406
I'm sorry.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:37.662
The police are investigating
the location ofthe remaining limbs...

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:44.169
- Hello?
- Yes.

01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:46.171
I understand your situation,

01:29:46.255 --> 01:29:49.007
but we can't give out the identity
ofthe victim to anyone.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:54.846
She's... Her name is Lee Hwa-ja,
just tell me if it's her or not.

01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:57.349
Sir, we can't do that over the phone.

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:59.976
You have to go
to the police station...

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:03.814
The killer's business is...
Mokpo Seafood...

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.065
His number is 016...

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:08.819
We can't give out the information
because of privacy issues, sir.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:12.906
Please, this could be my wife.
I really need to find out.

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:16.076
Lee Hwa-ja, Mokpo Seafood.

01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:17.869
Sir, please understand...

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:20.997
Stop saying "sir",
you don't fucking know me!

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.253
- That it?
- Yeah.

01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:11.548
Everyone out!

01:31:18.514 --> 01:31:19.389
Pier 6

01:31:21.601 --> 01:31:22.767
No Trespassing

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.400
Did Young-bae send you?

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:15.070
Come out.

01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:33.213
Did you bring the money?

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.007
Here.

01:32:43.683 --> 01:32:45.308
Follow me.

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:57.779
Inside.

01:32:57.863 --> 01:32:59.656
Get inside.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:10.166
Hold on.

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:11.835
Lock it!

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.629
Lock it, dammit!

01:33:14.714 --> 01:33:17.632
Shit!

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:23.722
Son of bitch!

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.225
Stop him! My arm!

01:33:27.351 --> 01:33:28.393
What the hell?

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:38.028
Fucker!

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.654
Get him!

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:41.740
Son of bitch!

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:07.766
He's right there.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.353
Just climb over!

01:34:15.775 --> 01:34:18.485
- Get him!
- What's taking so long?

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.111
Grab him!

01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:21.696
Get the fucker!

01:34:21.781 --> 01:34:23.406
Hurry! Run for him!

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:24.491
Run!

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.326
Get him!

01:34:28.412 --> 01:34:30.747
Go get him! Stop him!

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:35.460
Get him!

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:37.337
Get the fucker!

01:34:39.131 --> 01:34:41.549
Everyone, get him!

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:46.054
Get him!

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:50.308
Stop him!

01:34:50.434 --> 01:34:51.810
Kill him!

01:35:47.366 --> 01:35:49.033
You son of bitch!

01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:08.219
Stop!

01:36:08.888 --> 01:36:10.722
Everyone step aside!

01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:14.225
Step aside!

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:17.896
Fucking morons,
can't even catch a cornered rat.

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:20.648
- Son of a bitch...
- Give me that.

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:23.568
- Gu-nam.
- You son of a bitch!

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.544
Shifty bastard.

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:46.925
What are you waiting for?
Go get him!

01:36:48.427 --> 01:36:50.512
Why are you running that way?
Damn it!

01:43:18.233 --> 01:43:24.322
The Yellow Sea

01:43:30.787 --> 01:43:33.831
- Why were you at Busan Port?
- For sightseeing.

01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:38.169
You're saying Myun met
with Kim Tae-won?

01:43:38.295 --> 01:43:39.378
Yes.

01:43:39.504 --> 01:43:41.881
And right after they met,

01:43:42.007 --> 01:43:46.093
he went to Busan with you all,
is that correct?

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:47.178
Yes.

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:52.683
- Kim will deny everything, naturally.
- We have to find Myun then.

01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:58.272
Shit. Where the fuck
do we find him?

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.554
I'm going to sleep.

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.397
Dirty bastards!

01:44:40.565 --> 01:44:42.191
So fucking messy.

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.250
Wait a minute...

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.588
Stupid idiot.

01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:07.842
What the hell am I doing?

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.930
Hello, Choi?
Bring your boss here.

01:45:13.598 --> 01:45:15.182
It's very important.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.074
Shit, I can't tell.

01:45:32.784 --> 01:45:35.328
Hello? It's me.

01:45:35.454 --> 01:45:37.747
I checked the body.

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.916
It's her.
It's the same person as the photo.

01:45:43.795 --> 01:45:45.421
Hello?

01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:47.131
Are you sure?

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:50.926
Yes, I'm sure.
I knew it was her in one glance.

01:45:51.636 --> 01:45:53.971
Hello? Hello?

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.933
Go on.

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:01.479
Also, they have to cremate her
right away.

01:46:01.605 --> 01:46:06.776
Normally it costs $3,000,
but I found a place that'll do for two.

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.111
Can you put together two grand?

01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.239
Hello?

01:46:12.824 --> 01:46:14.492
Go ahead.

01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:50.361
- Put my daughter on.
- Has something happened?

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.489
- Gu-nam?
- It's nothing.

01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:58.869
Will you just put her on?
Get her for me.

01:46:58.954 --> 01:47:04.875
Do you know what time it is?
Tell me what's going on.

01:48:37.052 --> 01:48:38.552
Mr Kim.

01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:42.806
Kim Tae-won?

01:48:44.059 --> 01:48:45.643
Conniving bastard.

01:50:12.063 --> 01:50:17.276
"...and increase in number;
fill the earth and subdue it.

01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:20.487
"Rule over the fish of the sea
and the birds of the air

01:50:20.572 --> 01:50:25.409
"and over every living creature
that moves on the ground."

01:50:25.535 --> 01:50:27.244
- Amen!
- Then God said...

01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:29.830
How could you let him slip away,
you morons?

01:50:29.914 --> 01:50:32.875
Find that fucker! Find him!

01:51:50.245 --> 01:51:51.662
It's OK.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:13.976
I'm sorry.

01:52:17.564 --> 01:52:19.940
You won't believe me,

01:52:20.024 --> 01:52:22.651
but I'm not the one
who killed your husband.

01:52:25.655 --> 01:52:27.322
The killer was...

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.075
...his driver.

01:52:35.999 --> 01:52:40.878
I can't...go back to China.

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:47.259
I'll probably die here.

01:52:50.013 --> 01:52:52.055
But before I die...

01:52:53.892 --> 01:52:57.936
...I need to find out
who started this,

01:52:59.898 --> 01:53:02.316
how it happened.

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:06.069
Only after I find out,

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:10.115
can I then die.

01:53:16.748 --> 01:53:20.834
And when I see him,
I'll kill him for you.

01:53:29.385 --> 01:53:31.470
Please answer my questions.

01:53:42.357 --> 01:53:43.774
Welcome.

01:53:47.111 --> 01:53:49.279
Sir, please take off your shoes.

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:57.454
Who's the boss here?

01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:08.298
Hey!

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:24.189
Is this it?

01:55:08.151 --> 01:55:09.651
What?

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:13.238
A couple of hours ago,
we were out looking for Myun,

01:55:13.364 --> 01:55:17.576
and we found someone who
ordered the hit on the professor.

01:55:17.702 --> 01:55:20.537
What are you talking about?

01:55:20.663 --> 01:55:23.498
He said he paid to have
the professor killed.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:26.376
He was bragging
to his drinking buddies.

01:55:26.502 --> 01:55:28.879
You're not making any sense.

01:55:30.715 --> 01:55:33.717
- Where is this asshole?
- He's in the basement.

01:55:40.892 --> 01:55:43.060
- This is him?
- Yes.

01:55:45.521 --> 01:55:47.356
Explain to me what happened.

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:50.734
This sounds real, sir.
He works as a waiter in town...

01:55:50.818 --> 01:55:53.278
You be quiet.

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:56.865
Tell me, before I kill you.

01:55:57.909 --> 01:56:02.162
He said, he wanted to kill someone...

01:56:02.246 --> 01:56:06.583
- Who?
- A customer, he comes in often...

01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:09.294
This is him.

01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:11.254
HK Bank
Manager Kim Jung-hwan

01:56:13.049 --> 01:56:15.550
He asked you to do it?

01:56:16.552 --> 01:56:20.555
He talked about it
whenever he drank.

01:56:21.891 --> 01:56:24.726
- I said, did he ask you to do it?
- Yes, yes.

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.145
So what did you do?

01:56:27.271 --> 01:56:34.945
My wife knows someone in Yanji
and he does this kind of work.

01:56:35.029 --> 01:56:37.114
So you hired him?

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:38.907
Yes.

01:56:41.119 --> 01:56:46.248
- And then?
- I don't know. I really don't know!

01:56:48.126 --> 01:56:53.296
Then who is it in Yanji,
the one your wife knows?

01:56:53.381 --> 01:56:54.965
It's Myun Jung-hak.

01:56:55.049 --> 01:56:56.758
Shut the fuck up!

01:57:00.763 --> 01:57:03.974
What's his name?

01:57:05.643 --> 01:57:07.060
Myu...

01:57:07.979 --> 01:57:10.063
Myun Jung-hak.

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:26.329
Get Choi over here.

01:57:36.174 --> 01:57:38.091
Hello?

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.432
Who the hell?

01:57:55.526 --> 01:57:56.860
Speak.

01:58:14.212 --> 01:58:16.171
I'll talk. I will.

01:58:21.677 --> 01:58:23.553
Kim Tae-won...

01:58:23.638 --> 01:58:24.763
Who?

01:58:24.889 --> 01:58:27.724
Kim Tae-won.
It's Kim Tae-won.

01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:29.643
What is he?

01:58:35.817 --> 01:58:37.484
President Kim Tae-won

01:58:39.237 --> 01:58:41.822
Where are you, you fuck!

01:58:43.032 --> 01:58:44.783
Son of a bitch...

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.411
Go and drag his ass over here.

02:00:12.788 --> 02:00:16.333
Do we have to stab him?
Can't we just bury him?

02:00:16.459 --> 02:00:18.418
- What if he attacks?
- But he's still human...

02:00:18.502 --> 02:00:21.504
Stop saying that!
Got to finish what we started.

02:00:23.466 --> 02:00:26.676
Just close your eyes and stab him.
Got it?

02:00:28.763 --> 02:00:30.180
Get out.

02:00:35.102 --> 02:00:38.188
- Open the trunk on three.
- OK.

02:00:39.482 --> 02:00:40.774
One.

02:00:40.858 --> 02:00:42.901
Two.

02:00:43.027 --> 02:00:44.277
Three!

02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:28.405
I'm so sorry.

02:01:28.531 --> 02:01:33.410
I'll give you his share.
Let's divide the money and split.

02:01:37.415 --> 02:01:41.376
I'm a Joseonjok, too,
also from Yanji.

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:45.255
I'll kill the man who hired me.
I'll do it!

02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:50.343
His business card is in the car,
go take a look.

02:01:50.428 --> 02:01:54.139
Don't come any closer,
you crazy bastard!

02:02:15.786 --> 02:02:17.996
HK Bank
Manager Kim Jung-hwan

02:02:42.271 --> 02:02:45.065
Go bring me his shirt.

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:01.706
Roll it.

02:03:03.125 --> 02:03:05.001
Dress this wound!

02:03:26.524 --> 02:03:28.024
Mr Kim.

02:03:29.652 --> 02:03:31.986
Give me rest of the money.

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:33.947
Of course.

02:03:34.031 --> 02:03:36.491
- Right now.
- Now?

02:03:38.702 --> 02:03:42.205
- It's too early...
- Is that so?

02:03:44.166 --> 02:03:47.710
- Then let's wait somewhere.
- Where...where?

02:03:49.338 --> 02:03:52.173
- Your home.
- That's...

02:03:52.258 --> 02:03:54.008
Shut your mouth!

02:03:57.888 --> 02:04:00.014
Open that hole again,
I'll cut your head off!

02:04:24.081 --> 02:04:25.582
You slimy fuck!

02:05:07.082 --> 02:05:08.791
Fucking rat.

02:08:24.738 --> 02:08:26.322
Kim Tae-won

02:08:37.626 --> 02:08:42.755
He fucked my woman...
in my home.

02:08:43.799 --> 02:08:53.224
He fucked my woman...

02:08:54.017 --> 02:08:56.269
...in my own home.

02:08:56.770 --> 02:09:00.273
He...fucked...her.

02:09:14.037 --> 02:09:20.209
Meanwhile, the police reports
that the suspect at large

02:09:20.294 --> 02:09:23.713
is considered armed
and dangerous.

02:09:23.797 --> 02:09:30.553
This just in. Moments ago, the body
of Kim Tae-won was discovered.

02:09:30.637 --> 02:09:32.889
He was under investigation

02:09:33.015 --> 02:09:36.726
in connection with the murder
of Professor Kim...

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:21.390
Hey!

02:12:30.442 --> 02:12:32.068
Start the engine.

02:14:56.129 --> 02:14:59.048
