00:31.988 --> 00:33.922
Welcome to Starbase 11 ,
Captain.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.548
The commodore's
waiting to see you.

00:35.625 --> 00:38.321
He's curious why you
changed course and came here.

00:42.832 --> 00:44.493
We received
a subspace message

00:44.568 --> 00:46.058
to divert here
immediately.

00:46.136 --> 00:49.003
This base sent
no message, Captain.

00:56.079 --> 00:58.513
Oh,Jim, I just can't
understand this.

00:58.582 --> 01:00.447
Mr. Spock received
a starbase transmission,

01:00.517 --> 01:02.451
a message from former
Enterprise commander

01:02.519 --> 01:04.077
Fleet Captain Pike,

01:04.154 --> 01:05.917
urgently requesting
we divert here.

01:05.989 --> 01:07.217
Impossible.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.952
If my first officer states
he received a transmission--

01:10.026 --> 01:11.459
I'm not doubting
anyone's word.

01:11.528 --> 01:12.961
I'm telling you
it's impossible.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.257
Why?

01:14.331 --> 01:16.026
You don't know?

01:16.099 --> 01:17.464
You actually don't know

01:17.534 --> 01:19.468
what's happened
to Captain Pike?

01:19.536 --> 01:21.970
There's been subspace chatter
about it for months.

01:22.038 --> 01:25.633
I'm sorry to be
the one to show you.

01:25.709 --> 01:28.303
He's upstairs in
the medical section.

01:38.555 --> 01:40.489
You ever met
Chris Pike?

01:40.557 --> 01:42.991
When he was promoted
to fleet captain.

01:43.059 --> 01:44.492
About your age.

01:44.561 --> 01:45.994
Big, handsome man--
vital, active.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.122
Spock served with him
for several years.

01:49.199 --> 01:51.360
11 years,
4 months, 5 days.

01:51.434 --> 01:52.867
What's his problem,
Commodore?

01:52.936 --> 01:54.995
Inspection tour
of a cadet vessel.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.504
Old Class "J" starship.

01:56.573 --> 01:58.905
One of the
battle plates ruptured.

02:01.111 --> 02:02.942
The delta rays?

02:04.514 --> 02:05.947
He went in
bringing out

02:06.016 --> 02:08.314
all those kids
that were still alive.

02:08.384 --> 02:10.410
Just wanted you gentlemen
to be prepared.

02:19.529 --> 02:21.463
[Commodore Mendez]
Captain Pike.

02:47.757 --> 02:50.988
Captain, you remember
these gentlemen.

02:51.061 --> 02:52.995
They wanted
to visit you.

02:55.565 --> 02:57.556
Two flashes mean no.

03:02.772 --> 03:05.605
I thought you might make
an exception for them.

03:08.011 --> 03:10.445
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

03:10.513 --> 03:13.573
Chris, if there's anything
I can do for you...

03:18.521 --> 03:20.489
Captain Pike,

03:20.557 --> 03:22.957
may I remain
for a moment?

03:38.541 --> 03:41.908
You know why
I've come, Captain.

03:41.978 --> 03:44.469
It's only six days away
at maximum warp.

03:44.547 --> 03:45.980
I have it
well-planned.

03:55.759 --> 03:58.990
I have never disobeyed
your orders before, Captain,

03:59.062 --> 04:01.428
but this time I must.

04:02.999 --> 04:03.988
I know.

04:04.067 --> 04:07.002
I know it is treachery
and it's mutiny...

04:09.272 --> 04:11.740
but I must do this.

04:14.177 --> 04:16.111
I have no choice.

04:28.525 --> 04:32.461
Space--
the final frontier.

04:32.529 --> 04:36.295
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

04:36.366 --> 04:38.300
Its five-year mission--

04:38.368 --> 04:40.962
to explore
strange new worlds,

04:41.037 --> 04:45.030
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:45.108 --> 04:48.976
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

05:27.617 --> 05:29.050
Once more,Jose.

05:29.118 --> 05:31.109
Spock stated he received
a message to come here.

05:31.187 --> 05:33.121
He entered same
in his log.

05:33.189 --> 05:35.123
That's all the proof
I require.

05:35.191 --> 05:37.125
What do those
record tapes show?

05:37.193 --> 05:39.127
No message
sent from here.

05:39.195 --> 05:41.629
No message received
by your vessel.

05:41.698 --> 05:43.632
Then I suggest
the record tapes

05:43.700 --> 05:45.133
have been
deliberately changed.

05:45.201 --> 05:48.364
A computer expert
can change record tapes,

05:48.438 --> 05:49.871
say anything,
say nothing.

05:49.939 --> 05:51.873
Your first officer's
former captain

05:51.941 --> 05:53.568
is horribly injured
at this base.

05:53.643 --> 05:56.874
That first officer's the only
one who heard that message.

05:56.946 --> 05:59.141
He could have
requested leave.

05:59.215 --> 06:00.580
I would have granted it.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.584
Well, that's true.
Of course.

06:07.657 --> 06:10.091
Who would want
to divert us here?

06:10.159 --> 06:12.093
There's no trouble

06:12.161 --> 06:14.595
in the space sector
we're patrolling now.

06:14.664 --> 06:17.098
No alien problems.

06:20.069 --> 06:21.502
Computer Center.

06:22.672 --> 06:24.105
Chief Humboldt here, sir.

06:24.173 --> 06:27.609
Have you rechecked all the record
tapes on the date in question?

06:27.677 --> 06:28.644
Yes, sir.

06:28.711 --> 06:31.111
Coulda message
have been sent from here

06:31.180 --> 06:32.613
without us knowing it?

06:32.682 --> 06:33.614
Negative, Commodore.

06:33.683 --> 06:35.116
We've checked
everything possible.

06:35.184 --> 06:36.116
All right.

06:36.185 --> 06:37.618
Start checking
the impossible.

06:37.687 --> 06:39.120
Mendez out.

07:22.665 --> 07:25.099
Oh, have I introduced
Miss Piper,Jim?

07:25.168 --> 07:27.602
This is Captain Kirk,
Miss Piper.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.501
I recognized the captain
immediately.

07:29.572 --> 07:32.006
A mutual friend
described you, sir--

07:32.075 --> 07:33.599
Lieutenant Helen Johansson.

07:33.676 --> 07:35.541
Helen described...

07:35.612 --> 07:37.773
She merely mentioned
she knew you, sir.

07:37.847 --> 07:40.008
Oh.

07:42.251 --> 07:44.481
You have something
to report, Miss Piper?

07:44.554 --> 07:45.987
Oh, yes, sir.

07:46.055 --> 07:47.488
I'm afraid
our investigation

07:47.557 --> 07:49.491
turned up
very little, Commodore.

07:49.559 --> 07:50.992
There is, of course,

07:51.060 --> 07:54.029
Mr. Spock's years of service
with Captain Pike.

07:54.097 --> 07:56.122
Indications of loyalty
to this former commander.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.633
A Vulcan can
no sooner be disloyal

07:58.701 --> 08:00.566
than he can exist
without breathing,

08:00.637 --> 08:02.400
present commander
as well as past.

08:02.472 --> 08:05.066
We're forced to consider
every possibility, sir.

08:05.141 --> 08:08.304
Captain Pike could not
have sent a message.

08:08.378 --> 08:09.811
He's under observation

08:09.879 --> 08:11.710
every minute
of every day.

08:11.781 --> 08:13.373
And totally
unable to move.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.882
His wheel chair
is constructed

08:14.951 --> 08:17.181
to respond
to his brain waves.

08:17.253 --> 08:20.086
Oh, he can turn it,
move it forwards,

08:20.156 --> 08:21.646
or backwards
slightly.

08:21.724 --> 08:24.215
Through the light,
he can say yes or no.

08:24.293 --> 08:26.352
But that's it,Jim.

08:26.429 --> 08:29.592
That's as much as
that poor devil can do.

08:29.666 --> 08:32.601
His mind is as active
as yours and mine,

08:32.669 --> 08:34.102
but it's trapped inside

08:34.169 --> 08:36.263
a useless
vegetating body.

08:36.339 --> 08:39.102
He's kept alive
mechanically...

08:39.174 --> 08:41.871
a battery-driven heart.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.538
There's no way he
could even have asked

08:44.614 --> 08:46.013
for that message
to be sent?

08:54.023 --> 08:56.287
[Spock's Voice, Slow Speed]
Starbase Operations.

08:56.359 --> 08:58.122
[Faster Speed]
Starbase Operations.

08:58.194 --> 09:00.059
[Normal]
Starbase Operations.

09:00.129 --> 09:02.063
[Fastest Speed]
Starbase Operations.

09:02.131 --> 09:03.564
[Slower Speed]
Starbase Operations.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.066
[Normal Speed]
Starbase Operations.

09:05.134 --> 09:06.567
Starbase Operations...

09:06.636 --> 09:08.069
Starbase Operations,
Enterprise...

09:08.137 --> 09:10.765
Standby to receive
new orders, Enterprise.

09:19.649 --> 09:22.584
Starbase Operation,
Mr. Hansen.

09:22.652 --> 09:24.586
Starbase Operations
to Enterprise.

09:24.654 --> 09:27.589
Standby to receive
new orders.

09:27.657 --> 09:29.090
They're to be fed

09:29.158 --> 09:31.592
directly into
the ship's computers.

09:31.661 --> 09:34.095
This is top-secret
and scrambled.

09:41.671 --> 09:44.105
Enterprise standing by.

09:47.677 --> 09:50.111
Request confirmation.

09:52.682 --> 09:55.116
Enterprise
to starbase.

09:55.184 --> 09:56.776
Request confirmation.

09:56.853 --> 09:58.286
This is
a security area.

09:58.354 --> 09:59.616
I have security
clearance, Chief.

09:59.689 --> 10:02.624
Who gave you clearance?
I haven't been notified.

10:02.692 --> 10:04.626
You're
cross-circuiting the--

10:07.697 --> 10:09.096
Whose tapes are these?

10:10.233 --> 10:12.133
Repeat, Enterprise
to starbase.

10:12.201 --> 10:13.634
Orders received.

10:13.703 --> 10:15.136
We need operating
confirmation

10:15.204 --> 10:17.138
from the ship's
captain.

10:18.941 --> 10:20.636
Come in, starbase.

10:20.710 --> 10:22.302
Come in, Captain Kirk.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.613
This is Captain Kirk.

10:25.681 --> 10:27.512
You have confirmation,
Miss Uhura.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.574
Hansen here, Captain.

10:29.652 --> 10:31.620
Our destination has been
scramble-fed into ship's computers.

10:31.687 --> 10:33.621
How can I handle
the helm

10:33.689 --> 10:36.123
if I don't know
where we'regoing?

10:37.693 --> 10:39.627
Mr. Spock
is with me here.

10:39.695 --> 10:42.129
He'll answer all questions.
Kirk out.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.128
This is Mr. Spock.

10:50.206 --> 10:53.505
The ship's computers will
handle the helm on this voyage.

10:53.576 --> 10:56.136
Course will be set
automatically.

10:56.212 --> 10:57.645
You will not
discuss this

10:57.713 --> 10:59.578
with ship's crew
or starbase personnel.

10:59.649 --> 11:00.946
Do you read?

11:01.017 --> 11:02.382
Acknowledge, sir.

11:02.451 --> 11:03.383
Stand by.

11:03.452 --> 11:06.080
We'll warp out of orbit
in one hour.

11:23.673 --> 11:25.607
He keeps blinking no.

11:25.675 --> 11:27.609
No to what?

11:27.677 --> 11:29.110
They've tried
questioning him.

11:29.178 --> 11:32.113
He's almost agitated himself
into a coma.

11:32.181 --> 11:34.115
How long will he live?

11:34.183 --> 11:36.617
As long as any of us.

11:36.686 --> 11:38.119
Blast medicine anyway.

11:38.187 --> 11:41.623
We've learned to tie into
every human organ in the body

11:41.691 --> 11:43.124
except one--
the brain.

11:43.192 --> 11:46.127
The brain is what life
is all about.

11:46.195 --> 11:49.130
That man can think
any thought that we can,

11:49.198 --> 11:54.135
and love, hope,
dream as much as we can,

11:54.203 --> 11:57.639
but he can't reach out,
and no one can reach in.

11:57.707 --> 12:01.074
He keeps blinking no.

12:01.143 --> 12:02.576
No to what?

12:02.645 --> 12:05.079
They could question him
for days, weeks,

12:05.147 --> 12:08.082
before they stumble
on the right thing.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.583
Bones...

12:11.153 --> 12:14.589
Could this have anything
to do with Spock?

12:14.657 --> 12:17.592
I don't read you
at all,Jim.

12:17.660 --> 12:20.595
What I mean is...

12:20.663 --> 12:23.097
either a message
was received...

12:30.673 --> 12:33.107
It was one
of two things.

12:33.175 --> 12:35.109
Either someone
sent a message

12:35.177 --> 12:36.610
diverting us here,

12:36.679 --> 12:39.239
or someone lied
about receiving it.

12:39.315 --> 12:41.408
Could that someone
be Mr. Spock?

12:41.484 --> 12:43.918
Forgetting how well
we both know Spock,

12:43.986 --> 12:45.613
the fact
that he's a Vulcan

12:45.688 --> 12:48.384
means he's incapable
of telling a lie.

12:48.457 --> 12:50.618
He's also half human.

12:50.693 --> 12:53.127
And that half is
completely submerged.

12:53.195 --> 12:55.629
To be caught
acting like us

12:55.698 --> 12:57.632
or even thinking like us

12:57.700 --> 12:59.133
would completely
embarrass him.

12:59.201 --> 13:01.066
Someone's interfering
with my command.

13:01.137 --> 13:03.071
I mean to find out who.

13:03.139 --> 13:05.073
If you had
the technical know-how,

13:05.141 --> 13:06.574
I'd suspect you.

13:06.642 --> 13:08.405
But you don't.
Spock does.

13:08.477 --> 13:09.842
He would not make--

13:09.912 --> 13:12.779
There's a false entry
in the log right now.

13:12.848 --> 13:13.780
Explain that.

13:13.849 --> 13:14.781
I can't.

13:14.850 --> 13:16.477
But to question Spock?

13:16.552 --> 13:17.484
Me, yes.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.578
I could run off
half-cocked.

13:19.655 --> 13:21.589
So could you,
but not Spock.

13:21.657 --> 13:22.988
That's impossible.

13:23.059 --> 13:25.493
Dr. McCoy, report
to Transporter Control.

13:25.561 --> 13:27.586
Dr. McCoy
to Transporter Control.

13:27.663 --> 13:29.096
McCoy here.

13:29.165 --> 13:31.599
You're needed aboard
the Enterprise, doctor.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.599
Medical emergency.

13:32.668 --> 13:34.101
Well, what is it?

13:34.170 --> 13:36.104
Sickness, injury...
how bad is it?

13:36.172 --> 13:38.606
That'sall we have
on it, Doctor.

13:38.674 --> 13:40.107
Just needed aboard.

13:45.681 --> 13:49.617
Probably somebody
discovered a hangnail.

13:49.685 --> 13:52.620
I'll beam up
and let you know,Jim.

13:59.628 --> 14:03.064
"For eyes of
Starfleet Command only."

14:03.132 --> 14:04.565
Oh, I'm certifying

14:04.633 --> 14:07.067
I ordered you
to read it.

14:07.136 --> 14:10.230
Know anything at all
about this planet?

14:10.306 --> 14:12.399
What every captain knows--
General Order 7.

14:12.475 --> 14:14.568
No vessel under
any condition,

14:14.643 --> 14:17.077
emergency or otherwise,
is to visit Talos IV.

14:17.146 --> 14:20.081
To do so is the only
death penalty left on our books.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.083
Only Fleet Command
knows why.

14:22.151 --> 14:23.846
Not even this file
explains that.

14:28.657 --> 14:31.091
But it does name
the only Earth ship

14:31.160 --> 14:33.094
that ever visited
the planet.

14:38.467 --> 14:39.695
The Enterprise...

14:42.004 --> 14:43.938
commanded by Captain
Christopher Pike.

14:44.006 --> 14:46.873
With a half Vulcan
science officer named Spock.

14:48.677 --> 14:49.609
Commodore!

14:49.678 --> 14:51.669
Captain Pike, he's gone!

14:55.184 --> 14:57.118
Mendez here. What is it?

14:57.186 --> 14:58.619
Starship Enterprise,
Commodore.

14:58.687 --> 15:00.552
It's warping
out of orbit.

15:00.623 --> 15:02.557
Refuses to acknowledge
our signal.

15:15.771 --> 15:17.705
Out of orbit,
Mr. Spock.

15:17.773 --> 15:20.708
Seems strange
with no navigator on duty.

15:20.776 --> 15:23.244
The Enterprise knows
where she's going.

15:28.117 --> 15:30.176
Someone's trying
to hail us, sir.

15:30.252 --> 15:32.186
Maintain radio silence,
Lieutenant.

15:36.592 --> 15:38.526
This is
First Officer Spock.

15:38.594 --> 15:40.528
Per Starfleet orders
this date,

15:40.596 --> 15:42.029
I have been placed

15:42.098 --> 15:44.032
in temporary command
of the Enterprise.

15:46.102 --> 15:48.036
While our destination
is secret,

15:48.104 --> 15:50.231
our mission is
relatively simple.

15:50.306 --> 15:52.536
Starbase Command
has assigned Captain Kirk

15:52.608 --> 15:54.007
medical rest leave

15:54.076 --> 15:55.509
until our return.

15:55.578 --> 15:57.546
His instructions are
to obey my orders

15:57.613 --> 15:59.308
as you would his.

15:59.381 --> 16:00.973
First officer out.

16:01.050 --> 16:02.984
What's going on
around here?

16:03.052 --> 16:05.486
Who said Jim needed
a medical rest leave?

16:05.554 --> 16:08.523
This call about me
being needed aboard--

16:08.591 --> 16:10.354
No call was made.

16:10.426 --> 16:11.984
Doctor,
I regret they elected

16:12.061 --> 16:13.995
to keep certain things
from you.

16:14.063 --> 16:16.497
Will you come with me,
please?

16:30.746 --> 16:33.010
What is this, Spock?

16:34.083 --> 16:36.017
Captain,
are you all right?

16:36.085 --> 16:38.019
I see that you're
still signaling--

16:38.087 --> 16:39.520
Doctor,
one moment, please.

16:45.427 --> 16:46.860
Kirk to Dr. McCoy.

16:46.929 --> 16:49.022
I'm recordingyou
thismessage, Bones,

16:49.098 --> 16:51.032
so there willbe
no misunderstanding.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.534
I'm sorrto have
to make it an order.

16:53.602 --> 16:55.536
You're not to
disturb Captain Pike.

16:55.604 --> 16:57.731
Simply take
good care of him.

16:57.806 --> 16:59.967
Follow Spock's instructions
to the letter.

17:00.042 --> 17:00.974
Kirk out.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.493
Sir, scanners report
an object following us

17:20.563 --> 17:23.123
about the size of
a starbase shuttlecraft.

17:27.336 --> 17:28.769
Shall we reverse helm?

17:28.837 --> 17:30.771
Take no action,
Mr. Hansen.

17:34.076 --> 17:36.510
But at our speed,
they'll never catch us.

17:36.579 --> 17:39.013
In case they want
to reach us--

17:39.081 --> 17:41.515
You have your orders,
Mr. Hansen.

17:41.584 --> 17:43.347
We'll make no contact.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.980
Starbase Shuttlecraft 1
to Enterprise.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.982
Come in, please.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.483
Enterprise...

18:16.552 --> 18:18.986
Commodore Mendez
and Captain Kirk.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.989
If you read me,
you are ordered to reply.

18:22.057 --> 18:24.992
Repeating it on all
emergency frequencies,Jim.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.496
Spock is headed for Talos IV,
all right.

18:28.564 --> 18:31.499
Pulling ahead of us fast.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.501
Fuel is down to 63.3.

18:33.569 --> 18:35.503
If we turn back now,

18:35.571 --> 18:37.505
we've just got
barely enough

18:37.573 --> 18:39.507
to get us back
to the base.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.510
Shuttlecraft
to Enterprise, come in.

18:43.579 --> 18:47.015
Shuttlecraft
to Enterprise, come in.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.517
Enterprise,
come in!

19:01.030 --> 19:02.463
Librar computer.

19:02.531 --> 19:04.123
Lock on to sensors.

19:04.199 --> 19:06.963
Measure object
now following the Enterprise.

19:10.039 --> 19:11.472
Computed.

19:11.540 --> 19:13.974
Object isa Class "F"
shuttlecraft--

19:14.043 --> 19:16.978
Uranium metalshell,
ion enginepower--

19:17.046 --> 19:18.479
Stop.

19:18.547 --> 19:20.981
How long before
shuttlecraft's fuel supply

19:21.050 --> 19:22.984
forces return
to starbase?

19:26.055 --> 19:27.488
Computed.

19:27.556 --> 19:32.493
Shuttlecraft is already
pastpoint of safe return.

19:56.585 --> 19:58.519
[Power Draining]

20:01.090 --> 20:03.524
We coast.

20:03.592 --> 20:06.527
Blast you any way.

20:06.595 --> 20:09.428
You had no right
to come along.

20:09.498 --> 20:10.522
R.H.I.P., Captain--

20:10.599 --> 20:12.533
Rank has its privileges.

20:18.607 --> 20:21.007
Two hours
of oxygen left.

20:21.076 --> 20:23.237
Wonderful.

20:23.312 --> 20:26.042
Part of me hopes the Enterprise
won't come back for us.

20:26.115 --> 20:28.049
We step on that deck,

20:28.117 --> 20:30.176
Spock is court-martialed,
disgraced.

20:30.252 --> 20:31.549
He's dead...

20:31.620 --> 20:34.054
if he makes it
to Talos IV.

20:37.126 --> 20:40.061
Why would he want
to get Pike there?

20:40.129 --> 20:41.562
The command reports stated

20:41.630 --> 20:44.565
Talos contained no practical
benefits to mankind.

20:44.633 --> 20:47.568
Spock would have some logical
reason for going there.

20:47.636 --> 20:48.728
Maybe.

20:48.804 --> 20:50.567
Maybe he's
just gone mad.

21:02.851 --> 21:05.786
I keep wondering
who might be after us.

21:05.854 --> 21:08.789
I keep coming up
with the same answers.

21:08.857 --> 21:13.021
But I can't be right,
can l, Mr. Spock?

21:13.095 --> 21:14.027
Computer control.

21:14.096 --> 21:17.259
Lock on to shuttlecraft
following us.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.534
Lockedon.
Tractorbeam ready.

21:20.602 --> 21:23.537
Go to tape
Abel 7 Baker.

21:23.605 --> 21:26.039
Execute instructions.

21:26.108 --> 21:29.043
Is it the captain,
Mr. Spock?

21:33.615 --> 21:36.607
Sir, the engines
are reversing.

21:43.125 --> 21:46.060
She's brought herself
to a dead stop.

21:46.128 --> 21:48.562
This is the first officer
speaking.

21:48.630 --> 21:52.066
Security, send an armed team
to the bridge.

21:52.134 --> 21:55.331
Transporter Room, stand by
to beam Captain Kirk aboard.

21:55.404 --> 21:56.837
Effective until then,

21:56.905 --> 21:59.169
Lieutenant Hansen is
in operational command.

21:59.241 --> 22:00.265
Sir?

22:00.342 --> 22:02.503
First officer out.

22:04.079 --> 22:06.013
Doctor, as
senior officer present,

22:06.081 --> 22:09.016
I present myself to you
for arrest.

22:09.084 --> 22:10.016
You what?

22:10.085 --> 22:11.109
The charge...

22:11.186 --> 22:13.814
is mutiny, Doctor.

22:13.889 --> 22:16.983
I never received orders
to take command.

22:24.099 --> 22:26.033
Security reporting,
Mr. Spock.

22:29.605 --> 22:31.038
Doctor.

22:32.608 --> 22:35.042
Mr. Spock is, uh...

22:35.110 --> 22:36.202
under arrest.

22:36.278 --> 22:38.838
Is confinement
to quarters enough?

22:38.914 --> 22:39.846
Adequate, Doctor.

22:39.915 --> 22:41.644
I'll make no trouble.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.054
Well, confine him.

22:47.122 --> 22:48.555
Yes, sir.

22:56.899 --> 22:59.993
Store our shuttlecraft
on the hangar deck, Mr. Scott.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.501
Beam us directly aboard.

23:01.570 --> 23:03.197
All right.
Locked on to you.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.516
Transferring command
to you, sir.

23:16.585 --> 23:18.519
Accepting command.
Where's Mr. Spock?

23:18.587 --> 23:20.111
In his quarters,
under arrest.

23:20.188 --> 23:21.120
His quarters?

23:21.189 --> 23:23.282
After what he's done,
Lieutenant?

23:23.358 --> 23:24.791
Captain from bridge.

23:24.860 --> 23:26.794
The enginesare coming on.

23:26.862 --> 23:28.523
Reverse power.
Hold this position.

23:28.597 --> 23:30.030
Tell whoever
gave those orders--

23:30.098 --> 23:31.531
Sir, there's nobody
giving orders.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.535
Mr. Spock has the computers
running the ship.

23:34.603 --> 23:37.037
Disengage
computer control, Uhura.

23:37.105 --> 23:38.538
We can't disengage,
Captain.

23:38.607 --> 23:40.040
The helm
doesnot respond.

23:40.108 --> 23:41.541
[Muttering]

23:43.111 --> 23:45.545
Computer control,
come in.

23:45.614 --> 23:46.546
Computer.

23:46.615 --> 23:48.048
Disengage from helm.

23:48.116 --> 23:50.607
Unable to comply.

23:50.686 --> 23:52.119
This is the captain.

23:52.187 --> 23:53.620
On voice command,

23:53.689 --> 23:55.554
you will override all
contra instructions.

23:55.624 --> 23:56.750
Voice command...

23:56.825 --> 23:59.487
disengage from helm.

23:59.561 --> 24:02.121
Unable to comply.

24:02.197 --> 24:04.631
Any such attempt
will cross-circuit

24:04.700 --> 24:06.497
vessel's
life-supporting system.

24:06.568 --> 24:09.503
Computer control
cannot be disengaged

24:09.571 --> 24:12.506
until vessel reaches
planet Talos IV.

24:26.822 --> 24:30.758
Captain's log--
stardate 3012.4.

24:30.826 --> 24:33.260
Despite ourbest efforts
to disengage computers,

24:33.328 --> 24:35.762
the Enterprise is still
lockedon a heading

24:35.831 --> 24:39.096
for the mysterious planet
Talos IV.

24:39.167 --> 24:42.261
Meanwhile, as required by
Starfleet general orders,

24:42.337 --> 24:44.771
apreliminar hearing
on Lieutenant Commander Spock

24:44.840 --> 24:46.102
is being convened.

24:46.174 --> 24:48.768
And in all the years
of my service,

24:48.844 --> 24:52.109
this is the most painful
moment I've ever faced.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.613
This hearing
is convened.

24:58.186 --> 24:59.915
Mr. Spock...

24:59.988 --> 25:01.421
you're aware
of your right

25:01.490 --> 25:02.923
to counsel
of your choice?

25:02.991 --> 25:05.050
Sir, I waive counsel.

25:05.127 --> 25:07.561
Further, I waive
rights to this hearing

25:07.629 --> 25:09.358
and request
immediate court-martial.

25:09.431 --> 25:11.262
Request denied.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.494
May I inquire
on what grounds, Captain?

25:15.570 --> 25:18.004
A mutiny requires
a trial board

25:18.073 --> 25:20.473
of no less than three
command officers.

25:20.542 --> 25:21.975
Since there are
only two

25:22.044 --> 25:23.306
of that rank
available--

25:23.378 --> 25:24.811
Sir, I must point out

25:24.880 --> 25:27.314
there are three officers
of command rank available--

25:27.382 --> 25:29.646
yourself, Commodore Mendez,

25:29.718 --> 25:31.549
and Captain Christopher Pike.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.882
Denied.

25:32.954 --> 25:34.922
Captain Pike is
a complete invalid.

25:36.191 --> 25:37.453
I believe you'll find

25:37.526 --> 25:39.426
he's still
on the active duty list.

25:41.129 --> 25:43.359
We didn't have the heart
to retire him.

25:43.432 --> 25:44.660
He's got you.

25:44.733 --> 25:46.963
Whatever he's up to,
he's planned it well.

25:52.874 --> 25:56.469
Captain's log--
stardate 3012.6.

25:56.545 --> 25:58.308
General court-martial
convened.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.575
Mr. Spock has
again waived counsel

26:00.649 --> 26:02.913
and has entered
aplea of guilty.

26:08.156 --> 26:09.748
Mr. Spock,

26:09.825 --> 26:12.419
are you aware
in pleading guilty

26:12.494 --> 26:13.756
that a further charge

26:13.829 --> 26:15.091
involving the death penalty

26:15.163 --> 26:16.596
must be held against you

26:16.665 --> 26:19.099
should this vessel
enter the Talos stargroup?

26:19.167 --> 26:20.327
I am.

26:20.402 --> 26:22.495
Why?

26:22.571 --> 26:24.835
What does it
accomplish to go there

26:24.906 --> 26:26.999
or to take
Captain Pike there?

26:27.075 --> 26:29.509
I want to know why.

26:29.578 --> 26:32.513
Are your comments a part
of the record, sir?

26:32.581 --> 26:34.674
Yes, it's on
the record.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.012
Thank you.

26:36.084 --> 26:38.279
Request monitor screen
be engaged.

26:38.353 --> 26:39.479
For what purpose?

26:39.554 --> 26:40.987
To comply
with the request

26:41.056 --> 26:42.318
you just made, sir--

26:42.390 --> 26:43.823
that I explain
the importance

26:43.892 --> 26:45.291
of going to Talos IV.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.624
By asking why,
you've opened the door

26:47.696 --> 26:50.597
to any evidence
he may wish to present--

26:50.665 --> 26:52.963
Apparently
what he had in mind.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.968
Present your evidence.

26:55.036 --> 26:56.094
Screen on.

27:07.883 --> 27:09.646
This is 1 3 years ago.

27:11.386 --> 27:13.149
The Enterprise.

27:16.391 --> 27:19.326
And its commander--
Captain Christopher Pike.

27:34.209 --> 27:35.642
Definitely something
out there, Captain,

27:35.710 --> 27:36.972
headed this way.

27:39.447 --> 27:40.709
Screen off.

27:42.784 --> 27:44.376
Chris,

27:44.452 --> 27:46.886
was that really you
on the screen?

27:48.957 --> 27:50.390
That's impossible.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.552
Mr. Spock,

27:53.628 --> 27:55.061
no vessel
makes record tapes

27:55.130 --> 27:56.688
in that detail,
that perfect.

27:56.765 --> 27:58.027
What were we watching?

27:58.099 --> 28:00.090
I cannot tell you
at this time.

28:00.168 --> 28:01.635
Captain Pike,

28:01.703 --> 28:04.194
were any record tapes
of this nature made

28:04.272 --> 28:05.534
during your voyage?

28:10.779 --> 28:12.212
The court
is not obliged

28:12.280 --> 28:14.407
to view evidence
without knowing its source.

28:14.482 --> 28:17.747
Unless the court
asks a prisoner why, Commodore.

28:17.819 --> 28:19.446
You did
ask that question.

28:19.521 --> 28:22.115
You mean I was
maneuvered into asking.

28:22.190 --> 28:24.055
Your evidence
is out of order.

28:24.125 --> 28:26.355
I contest that.
I want to see more.

28:26.428 --> 28:27.861
You have that right,
Captain.

28:27.929 --> 28:29.362
But just because
the prisoner

28:29.431 --> 28:32.025
is your first officer
and your personal friend--

28:32.100 --> 28:33.931
That has nothing
to do with it.

28:34.002 --> 28:35.867
Very well. Continue.

28:35.937 --> 28:38.872
Screen on, Mr. Scott.

28:40.275 --> 28:41.537
No.
It'ssomething else.

28:41.610 --> 28:43.043
There's still
something out there.

28:43.111 --> 28:44.373
As I stated, gentlemen,

28:44.446 --> 28:46.038
this was 13 years ago.

28:46.114 --> 28:47.706
We were on routine patrol

28:47.782 --> 28:50.615
when the ship's sensors
detected something ahead.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.620
At first we were not
certain what it was.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.883
Coming to speed of light.
Collision course.

29:06.902 --> 29:09.268
The meteorite beam
has not deflected it, Captain.

29:09.337 --> 29:10.463
Evasive maneuvers, sir?

29:10.538 --> 29:12.005
Steady as we go.

29:24.185 --> 29:25.777
It's a radio wave, sir.

29:25.854 --> 29:28.288
We're passing through
an old-style distress signal.

29:29.858 --> 29:31.792
They were keyed
to cause interference

29:31.860 --> 29:34.454
and attract attention
this way.

29:34.529 --> 29:37.464
A ship in trouble
making a forced landing, sir.

29:37.532 --> 29:38.965
That's it.
No other message.

29:39.034 --> 29:40.296
I have a fix.

29:40.368 --> 29:42.302
It comes from
the Talos stargroup.

29:42.370 --> 29:45.362
We've no ships
or Earth colonies that far out.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.874
Their call letters check
with a survey expedition.

29:47.943 --> 29:50.036
S.S. Columbia disappeared
in that region

29:50.111 --> 29:51.510
approximately 18 years ago.

29:51.579 --> 29:53.012
It would
take that long

29:53.081 --> 29:54.844
for a radio beam
to travel.

29:55.917 --> 29:56.884
Records show

29:56.952 --> 29:59.011
the Talos group
has never been explored.

29:59.087 --> 30:00.486
Solar system
similar to Earth.

30:00.555 --> 30:01.988
11 planets.

30:02.057 --> 30:05.823
Number IV seems
to be Class "M"--

30:06.895 --> 30:07.987
Oxygen atmosphere.

30:09.230 --> 30:11.130
Then they could
still be alive,

30:11.199 --> 30:12.393
even after 18 years.

30:12.467 --> 30:14.298
If they survived
the crash.

30:14.369 --> 30:17.065
We aren't going to go,
to be certain?

30:17.138 --> 30:20.232
Not without any indication
of survivors, no.

30:20.308 --> 30:22.242
We'll continue
to the Vega Colony,

30:22.310 --> 30:25.211
take care of our own
sick and injured first.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.874
You have the helm.
Maintain present course.

30:27.949 --> 30:29.041
Yes, sir.

30:51.473 --> 30:52.565
Boyce here.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.574
Drop by my cabin,
Doctor.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.911
[Knock on Door]

31:11.459 --> 31:13.552
What's that?

31:13.628 --> 31:15.892
I didn't say there's
anything wrong with me.

31:17.265 --> 31:20.894
I understand we picked up
a distress signal.

31:20.969 --> 31:21.993
That's right.

31:23.538 --> 31:25.972
Unless we get anything
more positive on it,

31:26.041 --> 31:28.635
the condition of our own
crew takes precedent.

31:28.710 --> 31:31.770
I'd like to log the ship's
doctor's opinion, too.

31:31.846 --> 31:34.371
Oh, I concur
with yours, definitely.

31:35.617 --> 31:37.551
Good. I'm glad you do.

31:37.619 --> 31:40.213
We're going to stop first
at the Vega Colony

31:40.288 --> 31:42.722
and replace anybody
who needs hospitalization

31:42.791 --> 31:44.224
and also--

31:44.292 --> 31:46.556
What are you putting
in there, ice?

31:47.629 --> 31:49.893
Who wants
a warm martini?

31:51.800 --> 31:54.394
What makes you think
I need one?

31:54.469 --> 31:56.232
Sometimes...

31:56.304 --> 31:58.568
a man will tell
his bartender things

31:58.640 --> 32:01.165
he'll...never
tell his doctor.

32:04.079 --> 32:06.172
What's been
on your mind, Chris,

32:06.247 --> 32:07.680
the fight on Rigel 7?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.183
Shouldn't it be?

32:10.251 --> 32:13.186
My only yeoman and two others
dead, seven injured.

32:13.254 --> 32:15.688
Was there anything
you personally could have done?

32:15.757 --> 32:17.190
I should have
smelled trouble

32:17.258 --> 32:18.691
when I saw the swords.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.695
Instead I got attacked
by one of their warriors.

32:21.763 --> 32:23.697
Chris, you set
standards for yourself

32:23.765 --> 32:25.027
no one could meet.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.193
You treat everyone
like a human being

32:27.268 --> 32:28.257
except yourself.

32:28.336 --> 32:30.270
And now you're tired,
and you--

32:30.338 --> 32:32.602
You bet I'm tired.

32:32.674 --> 32:34.266
You bet.

32:34.342 --> 32:37.277
I'm tired of being responsible
for 203 lives,

32:37.345 --> 32:38.778
and I'm tired
of deciding

32:38.847 --> 32:41.281
which mission is too risky
and which isn't

32:41.349 --> 32:43.613
and who's going
on the landing party

32:43.685 --> 32:45.118
and who doesn't

32:45.186 --> 32:46.949
and who lives...

32:47.021 --> 32:48.613
and who dies.

32:51.025 --> 32:52.856
Boy,
I've had it, Phil.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.020
To the point of
taking my advice--

32:55.096 --> 32:56.188
a rest leave?

32:56.264 --> 32:58.698
To the point
of considering resigning.

33:00.201 --> 33:02.135
And do what?

33:02.203 --> 33:04.797
Well, for one thing,
go home.

33:06.708 --> 33:09.302
Nice little town with...

33:09.377 --> 33:11.641
50 miles of park land
around it.

33:13.381 --> 33:15.815
Remember I told you
I had two horses?

33:15.884 --> 33:18.978
We used to take food
and ride out all day.

33:19.053 --> 33:20.486
Ah, that sounds
exciting--

33:20.555 --> 33:22.989
ride out with
a picnic lunch every day.

33:23.057 --> 33:25.992
I said that's
one place I might go.

33:26.060 --> 33:28.494
Or I might go
into business on Regulus

33:28.563 --> 33:29.996
or on the Orion colony.

33:30.064 --> 33:31.326
You, an Orion trader,

33:31.399 --> 33:33.333
dealing in green animal,
women slaves?

33:33.401 --> 33:36.165
The point is this isn't
the only life available.

33:36.237 --> 33:38.432
There's a galaxy of things
to choose from.

33:38.506 --> 33:39.598
Not for you.

33:42.343 --> 33:43.935
A man either lives life

33:44.012 --> 33:45.445
as it happens to him,

33:45.513 --> 33:47.606
meets it head-on,
and licks it,

33:47.682 --> 33:49.274
or he...

33:49.350 --> 33:50.942
turns his back on it

33:51.019 --> 33:52.611
and starts
to wither away.

33:52.687 --> 33:54.951
Now you're beginning
to talk like a doctor,

33:55.023 --> 33:56.115
bartender.

33:56.191 --> 33:57.624
Take your choice.

33:57.692 --> 34:00.559
We both get the same two kinds
of customers--

34:00.628 --> 34:03.062
the living...
and the dying.

34:05.433 --> 34:09.369
[Intercom Whistles]

34:09.437 --> 34:10.870
Mr. Spock here.

34:10.938 --> 34:13.032
We're intercepting
a follow-up message.

34:13.107 --> 34:15.701
There are crash
survivors on Talos.

34:22.116 --> 34:23.947
" 11 survivors from crash.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.610
gravity and oxygen
within limits.

34:25.687 --> 34:27.120
food and water obtainable,

34:27.188 --> 34:28.120
but unless..."

34:28.188 --> 34:31.056
The message faded
at that point, sir.

34:41.869 --> 34:43.632
Address inner craft.

34:43.705 --> 34:45.467
System open.

34:45.540 --> 34:47.474
This is the captain.

34:47.542 --> 34:50.170
Our destination is
the Talos stargroup.

34:50.245 --> 34:53.510
Our time warp, Factor 7.

34:57.085 --> 34:59.952
Course computed
andon the screen.

35:00.021 --> 35:01.682
All deck shave
acknowledged, sir.

35:01.756 --> 35:03.621
Engage.

35:04.692 --> 35:05.784
Screen off.

35:08.196 --> 35:09.754
Mr. Spock,

35:09.831 --> 35:12.732
I'm truly amazed at
your technical prowess

35:12.800 --> 35:14.700
in some how
manufacturing all this.

35:14.769 --> 35:17.135
I congratulate you
on your imagination.

35:17.205 --> 35:19.605
But this is a court
of space law,

35:19.674 --> 35:20.936
not a theater.

35:21.009 --> 35:22.101
Captain,

35:22.176 --> 35:24.610
please tell the court
this is not imagination,

35:24.679 --> 35:27.113
nor some clever
photographic record.

35:27.181 --> 35:29.115
Are we seeing
the actual events

35:29.183 --> 35:30.445
of 13 years ago?

35:31.853 --> 35:33.616
Yes, gentlemen.

35:33.688 --> 35:35.952
On that screen
as it happened--

35:36.024 --> 35:37.286
the incredible experience

35:37.358 --> 35:39.622
of Captain Christopher Pike
on Talos IV.

35:39.694 --> 35:40.956
If, after
witnessing this,

35:41.029 --> 35:43.896
the court wishes
to turn this vessel back,

35:43.965 --> 35:46.695
I will release this ship
to manual control.

35:46.768 --> 35:48.861
You're in no position
to bargain.

35:48.936 --> 35:50.198
This is ridiculous.

35:50.271 --> 35:52.205
This man mutinied,
stole your ship,

35:52.273 --> 35:53.535
abducted Captain Pike.

35:53.608 --> 35:55.041
This has gone far enough.

35:55.109 --> 35:57.043
We haven't heard
the full story.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.373
I vote to continue.

35:58.446 --> 36:00.311
I vote we do not.
Deadlock.

36:00.381 --> 36:03.145
There's still one member
of the trial board

36:03.217 --> 36:04.650
to be heard from.

36:04.719 --> 36:06.846
Very well.
Captain Pike,

36:06.921 --> 36:08.183
it's up to you.

36:08.256 --> 36:10.190
Do we continue
under these conditions?

36:12.927 --> 36:14.224
Yes.

36:25.606 --> 36:27.540
Captain's log
supplemental.

36:27.608 --> 36:28.973
Mr. Spock,
on trial for mutiny,

36:29.043 --> 36:31.637
has forced the court
to accept unusual evidence.

36:31.713 --> 36:33.476
On our monitor screen,

36:33.548 --> 36:36.312
the voyage of Captain Pike
andthe Enterprise

36:36.384 --> 36:39.478
to the one forbidden world
in all the galaxy.

36:39.554 --> 36:40.486
Screen on.

36:57.038 --> 36:58.835
We've settled
into orbit, sir.

37:01.843 --> 37:03.435
Geological lab report
complete, Captain.

37:03.511 --> 37:05.103
Preliminary
lab survey ready, sir.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.111
Spectography?

37:06.180 --> 37:07.442
Our reading shows

37:07.515 --> 37:08.948
an oxygen/nitrogen
atmosphere, sir,

37:09.016 --> 37:10.278
heavy with
inert elements.

37:10.351 --> 37:11.283
Gravity?

37:11.352 --> 37:12.512
0.9 of Earth.

37:12.587 --> 37:14.248
Captain,
reflections, sir,

37:14.322 --> 37:15.755
from the planet's
surface.

37:18.459 --> 37:19.721
As I read it,

37:19.794 --> 37:22.388
they polarize out
as rounded metal bits.

37:22.463 --> 37:24.727
Could be parts
of a spaceship hull.

37:24.799 --> 37:27.063
Prep a landing party
of six.

37:27.135 --> 37:28.659
You feel up to it?

37:28.736 --> 37:29.668
Yes, sir.

37:33.574 --> 37:35.007
Sorry, number one.

37:35.076 --> 37:37.010
With little information
on this planet,

37:37.078 --> 37:39.512
we'll have to leave our
most experienced officer

37:39.580 --> 37:40.842
here covering us.

37:40.915 --> 37:42.177
Of course, sir.

37:56.431 --> 37:58.626
There's no indication
of problems down there,

37:58.699 --> 38:00.132
but let's
not take chances.

38:00.201 --> 38:02.135
There's a canyon
to the left.

38:02.203 --> 38:04.137
We can land you
there unobserved.

38:04.205 --> 38:05.137
Right.

40:09.096 --> 40:10.188
Sir.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.472
They're men.

40:28.883 --> 40:30.373
They're humans.

40:34.956 --> 40:36.218

Enterprise.

lnstitute.

40:41.729 --> 40:42.991
Is Earth all right?

40:43.064 --> 40:44.656
You'll see it
very soon.

40:44.732 --> 40:47.360
You won't believe
how fast you'll get back.

40:47.435 --> 40:48.902
The time barrier's
been broken.

40:48.970 --> 40:50.403
Our new ships can--

41:01.582 --> 41:03.743
This is Vina.

41:03.818 --> 41:05.080
Her parents are dead.

41:05.152 --> 41:07.586
She was born
almost as we crashed.

41:54.201 --> 41:55.293
Enterprise.

41:55.369 --> 41:56.802
Landingparty,
come in.

41:56.871 --> 41:58.395
We'll begin transporting
the survivors

41:58.472 --> 42:01.236
and their effects
up to you very shortly.

42:01.308 --> 42:02.741
Quartersare being
prepared, sir.

42:02.810 --> 42:05.404
Have I permission
to send scientific parties now?

42:05.479 --> 42:06.571
Affirmative on the--

42:08.983 --> 42:12.919
You appear to be healthy
and intelligent, Captain--

42:12.987 --> 42:15.820
a prime specimen.

42:15.890 --> 42:18.825
I didn't get
that last message, Captain.

42:18.893 --> 42:20.485
Uh...

42:20.561 --> 42:22.290
affirmative on request.

42:23.397 --> 42:24.796
Landing party out.

42:24.865 --> 42:28.301
You must forgive
her choice of words, Captain.

42:28.369 --> 42:29.802
She's lived
her whole life

42:29.870 --> 42:31.804
with a collection
of a ging scientists.

42:31.872 --> 42:34.306
If they can, uh,
spare you a moment,

42:34.375 --> 42:36.605
I'd like to make
my medical report.

42:36.677 --> 42:37.939
I think it's time

42:38.012 --> 42:39.946
to show the captain
our secret.

42:40.014 --> 42:42.881
Their health
is excellent,

42:42.950 --> 42:44.212
almost too good.

42:44.285 --> 42:46.219
There's a reason
for our condition,

42:46.287 --> 42:47.720
but we've
had some doubt

42:47.788 --> 42:50.382
if Earth is ready
to learn the secret.

42:50.458 --> 42:51.891
Let the girl
show you.

42:51.959 --> 42:53.392
We'll accept
your judgment.

43:12.747 --> 43:13.839
You're tired.

43:13.914 --> 43:16.348
But don't worry.
You'll feel much better soon.

43:26.761 --> 43:28.456
Don't you see it?

43:30.664 --> 43:32.757
Here and here.

43:34.268 --> 43:35.860
I...

43:35.936 --> 43:37.733
I don't understand.

43:37.805 --> 43:39.568
You will.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.904
You're a perfect choice.

43:59.794 --> 44:01.386
Captain!

45:06.794 --> 45:07.886
Spock here.

45:07.962 --> 45:09.827
Landing party, come in.

45:09.897 --> 45:12.832
There is no survivors'
encampment, Number One.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.460
This is all
some sort of trap.

45:15.536 --> 45:17.333
We've lost the captain.

45:17.404 --> 45:19.031
Do you read?

45:19.106 --> 45:21.870
[Intercom Whistles]

45:24.945 --> 45:26.207
What is it?

45:26.280 --> 45:27.645
It's for Commodore Mendez.

45:27.715 --> 45:30.479
Plead signal for you, sir.
Go ahead, Uhura.

45:30.551 --> 45:33.486
Commodore Mendez, urgent.

45:33.554 --> 45:35.317
Subspace monitors show

45:35.389 --> 45:38.654
Enterprise receiving
transmissions

45:38.726 --> 45:41.160
from planet Talos IV

45:41.228 --> 45:44.664
in violation of Starfleet
general orders.

45:44.732 --> 45:48.327
Receiving transmissions
from Talos IV.

45:48.402 --> 45:50.700
Then the images
we've been seeing are...

45:50.771 --> 45:52.204
Coming from Talos IV, sir.

45:52.273 --> 45:54.036
Captain Kirk
is here by relieved.

45:54.108 --> 45:57.373
You are ordered to assume
command of the Enterprise.

45:57.444 --> 45:59.139
Disable vessel
if necessar

45:59.213 --> 46:00.976
to prevent further contact.

46:01.048 --> 46:03.482
Message signed--
Comsole, Starfleet Command.

46:03.550 --> 46:05.711
Mr. Spock, you're
aware of the orders

46:05.786 --> 46:07.583
regarding any contact
with Talos IV.

46:07.655 --> 46:10.089
You have deliberately invited
the death penalty.

46:10.157 --> 46:12.057
You've not only
finished yourself, Spock,

46:12.126 --> 46:14.560
but you've finished
your captain as well.

46:14.628 --> 46:15.890
Commodore must be aware

46:15.963 --> 46:18.227
that Captain Kirk
knew nothing of this.

46:18.299 --> 46:19.766
A captain's responsible
for everything

46:19.833 --> 46:21.425
that occurs
on his ship.

46:21.502 --> 46:23.595
I order you to
return this vessel

46:23.671 --> 46:24.933
back to manual control.

46:32.346 --> 46:34.780
Sir...

46:34.848 --> 46:36.281
I respect fully decline.

46:37.518 --> 46:39.713
Very well. You've earned
the consequences.

46:39.787 --> 46:41.379
This court is in recess.

47:08.082 --> 47:10.016
Do you know
what you're doing?

47:10.084 --> 47:11.483
Have you
lost your mind?

47:11.552 --> 47:12.484
Captain.

47:12.553 --> 47:14.487
Jim, please...

47:14.555 --> 47:16.147
don't stop me.

47:16.223 --> 47:17.986
Don't let him stop me.

47:18.058 --> 47:21.550
It's your career
and Captain Pike's life.

47:21.628 --> 47:24.119
You must see the rest
of the transmission.

47:34.708 --> 47:36.141
Lock him up.
