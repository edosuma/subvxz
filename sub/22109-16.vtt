WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.310
(school bell ringing)

00:09.343 --> 00:12.046
Okay, children,
everyone pick an instrument.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.214
Doesn't matter which one.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.315
Everyone's gonna be bad.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.316
(chattering)

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
Eh, who cares? I'm union.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.654
I told you,
I am not playing an instrument.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.923
You're playing an instrument.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.226
Mom, music is made by computers,

00:25.259 --> 00:28.929
not rusty metal you put
in your-- ugh-- mouth.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.932
Look, your mom thinks
that forcing you to do music

00:31.965 --> 00:34.102
in school will somehow make you
into a different person

00:34.135 --> 00:36.770
than we all know you are--
which it won't-- so just do it,

00:36.804 --> 00:38.772
or I'll cut all your shorts
into skirts.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.940
Fine.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.975
What about this stupid thing?

00:44.112 --> 00:46.114
-(blowing notes)
-(kids grunting)

00:49.483 --> 00:50.951
(gasps)

00:50.984 --> 00:52.753
Why don't you try this clarinet?

00:52.786 --> 00:55.423
It's like the recorder,
but cooler.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.524
(groans)

00:56.557 --> 00:59.026
(upbeat march playing)

00:59.059 --> 01:00.394
(yelling)

01:02.130 --> 01:04.498
What about this hobo guitar?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
(light classical music playing)

01:08.569 --> 01:10.938
-(people screaming)
-(laughs)

01:10.971 --> 01:13.474
At least he was wearing
a tuxedo.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.109
Now can we get out of here?

01:15.143 --> 01:17.245
The Wi-Fi sucks,
and I'm trying to click through

01:17.278 --> 01:20.080
this slideshow of celebrities
who let themselves go.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.083
Word is that number four
is insane.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.952
And here's the form which says

01:24.985 --> 01:26.987
you're responsible
for the instrument.

01:28.989 --> 01:33.327
So, if I break the violin,
Homer has to pay?

01:33.361 --> 01:35.296
Homer has to pay?

01:35.329 --> 01:37.398
The school is lending
your son an instrument

01:37.431 --> 01:39.800
that's worth $430.

01:40.834 --> 01:41.969
(gasps)

01:42.002 --> 01:43.637
(shrieking melodically)

01:43.671 --> 01:48.809
Violin, you and me are gonna
make beautiful music together.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.844
(Symphony No. 5
by Beethoven playing)

02:13.301 --> 02:15.936
Bart? Bart?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.339
$430 violin?

02:21.141 --> 02:24.512
If the beer's in a frosted mug,
you're not an alcoholic,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.714
you're an aficionado.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.016
-(shrieks)
-Hello, Father.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.951
Thank you for
taking responsibility

02:30.984 --> 02:33.120
for this lovely instrument.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.055
I trust you find its music...

02:35.088 --> 02:37.658
-(plays screeching note)
-soothing.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.693
Come on, dude,
just leave me alone.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.530
I'm a good man.
I've got kids!

02:42.563 --> 02:44.398
You're right,
I've been too hard on you.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.200
Here you go. Catch.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.035
*

02:51.505 --> 02:53.507
*

02:56.009 --> 02:57.645
(laughs)

02:57.678 --> 03:00.648
You. You.
I took you into my home,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.583
and you've stolen everything
from me.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.218
You know what this is?

03:04.252 --> 03:07.087
It's me playing
the world's smallest violin.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.256
(laughs)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.290
(yells)

03:12.025 --> 03:13.594
(panting)

03:13.627 --> 03:15.329
I'm free. I'm free.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.964
I'm finally free!

03:19.300 --> 03:21.335
Mwah!

03:21.369 --> 03:23.170
(gasps)
Where are you going?

03:23.203 --> 03:27.875
To do to my brain what I just
did to your dreams for our son.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.445
LENNY, CARL and BARNEY:
Chug, chug, chug!

03:31.479 --> 03:33.447
Chug, chug, chug!

03:33.481 --> 03:34.882
(train chugging)

03:34.915 --> 03:37.084
-(whistle toots)
-(chuckles)

03:37.117 --> 03:41.121
The little engine that could...
get me wasted.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.924
Yeah, everyone loves
the ol' Disorient Express.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.859
-(whistle toots)
-(phone ringing)

03:45.893 --> 03:47.561
Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.797
What? You have
the nerve to call me?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.932
Why don't you delete my number
from your phone,

03:51.965 --> 03:53.601
then put the phone in a sock,

03:53.634 --> 03:55.202
and then beat yourself
in the head

03:55.235 --> 03:58.872
till your face looks like
motor lodge buffet eggs!

03:58.906 --> 04:00.874
(chuckles)
Yeah, another prank call, huh?

04:00.908 --> 04:03.777
Who was it this time, uh,
"Anita Manbone"?

04:03.811 --> 04:05.245
"Ivan Talickya"?

04:05.279 --> 04:06.947
Ooh, ooh, I got one.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.082
"John Rootbeer."

04:10.618 --> 04:11.919
Eh, it wasn't no prankster.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.054
It was someone I know
all too well.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.424
-Oh, who?
-Shut your stinkin' face-hole!

04:16.457 --> 04:18.626
That's who it was, okay?!
Bar's closed!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.994
Everybody get out! Get out!

04:23.163 --> 04:24.298
(groans)

04:24.332 --> 04:25.899
(blows)

04:25.933 --> 04:26.900
(buzzes)

04:26.934 --> 04:29.903
Oh, stupid drunk breath.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.104
Ah.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.006
-(blows)
-(buzzes)

04:33.040 --> 04:34.608
Oh, stupid drunk dog!

04:34.642 --> 04:38.011
(barking)

04:38.045 --> 04:41.148
Guess I'll have to order
a ride on my smartphone.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.785
Get in.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.354
(car door closes)

04:46.387 --> 04:49.122
No mints?
I should've just called Uber.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.360
Hey. What's with Moe?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.027
It's too late for the cockfights

04:54.061 --> 04:55.796
and too early
for the rat fights.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.466
He's been extra psycho
since he got that phone call.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.933
(muttering):
I just want to...

04:59.967 --> 05:01.969
(grunting, shouting)

05:02.002 --> 05:04.338
Oh, it sounds like that time
you lit the barbecue

05:04.372 --> 05:05.806
with a possum inside.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.140
(Moe panting)

05:07.174 --> 05:08.976
Hmm, maybe we should follow him.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.611
Mm, you're the sober one.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.847
Call me, will you?
Oh, I'll meet you, all right.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.449
I'll meet you good.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.852
(Moe muttering)

05:18.886 --> 05:20.888
(grunting, shouting)

05:25.593 --> 05:27.961
(shouting)

05:27.995 --> 05:29.497
-I'll kill you.
-(choking)

05:29.530 --> 05:30.864
I'll kill you, you dirty mug!

05:30.898 --> 05:32.666
You've got to stop them.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.704
Let me go, huh?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.305
I'm one loafer smack away

05:38.338 --> 05:40.240
from tearing off
his whole hair system!

05:40.273 --> 05:42.810
Why are you fighting
with an old man?

05:42.843 --> 05:45.513
Because this old man...
(panting)

05:45.546 --> 05:47.347
is my old man.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.883
Morty Szyslak.
Nice to meet you.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.152
You mean nothing to me. Huh?

05:52.185 --> 05:55.423
All you are is a rotten old
rib roast covered in cologne.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.190
You ungrateful punk.

05:57.224 --> 06:00.093
You're not worthy to walk
through a cloud of my scent.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.829
I never should've called you.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.797
On that we agree.

06:05.232 --> 06:09.937
The saddest thing in the world
is seeing a family broken apart.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.673
-(drunken growling)
-(chuckles)

06:12.706 --> 06:14.274
Drunk dog.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.183
Oh, I ain't seen
my pops for years.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.786
After he called,
I weakened and went to meet him.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.021
But one sniff of
"Eau de Sportcoat,"

06:28.055 --> 06:30.357
and my shoe was in my hand.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.927
How could you go so long
without seeing your own father?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.797
Seriously, how'd you do it?
It sounds amazing.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.265
Yeah, well, let me explain.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.101
You know how the world
sees me as a... a...

06:41.134 --> 06:43.136
-Human toilet brush?
-Bingo.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.773
Well, I'm the white sheep
of my family.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.308
They're involved
in a very evil business.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.578
-Illegal drugs?
-No, worse.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.647
-Prescription drugs?
-Oh, well, not that bad.

06:53.681 --> 06:57.384
The Szyslaks are...
mattress salesmen.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.453
-(both gasp)
-Eh, I know, I know.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.089
They're like mortgage brokers
without the moral code.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.091
Charging people 1,200 bucks

07:04.124 --> 07:06.494
for what's essentially
a big bag of hay.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.498
(humming)

07:12.500 --> 07:16.069
Growing up, it was me, my dad
and my brother and sister.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.105
We were the biggest
mattress chain in town,

07:18.138 --> 07:21.108
mainly thanks
to our local TV ads.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.143
(grunts)
How does it...?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.344
There it is.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.114
(fanfare playing)

07:27.147 --> 07:29.116
Here ye, hear ye!

07:29.149 --> 07:32.119
I declare the best deals
in all the land!

07:32.152 --> 07:34.822
And don't ye forget:
no credit...

07:34.855 --> 07:36.624
No problem!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.325
So come on down
to Mattress King,

07:38.358 --> 07:41.028
at any one of our many
convenient locations.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.765
We'll have you sleeping
on a new mattress

07:44.798 --> 07:46.834
-to...
-Knight!

07:46.867 --> 07:49.136
-And cut.
-Great work, kids.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.138
Everyone gets an onion.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.843
MOE: But there was another
reason for our success,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.477
as I was about to learn.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.714
Son, your voice is finally
gravelly enough

08:00.748 --> 08:04.618
for you to learn what it takes
to survive in the sleep biz.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
Bedbugs?!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.722
These are Hungarian
mattress gnashers.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.624
The only way to get rid of them

08:10.658 --> 08:13.694
is to walk away from your house
naked and start a new life.

08:13.727 --> 08:14.928
(chuckles)

08:17.030 --> 08:19.700
Y-You're gonna
sabotage our rivals?

08:19.733 --> 08:22.202
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You are.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.739
You want to be a sandman,
a slumber jack, a yawn jockey?

08:25.773 --> 08:29.342
This is what it takes.
It's the Szyslak way.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.057
MOE: They were
the competition, sure,

08:44.091 --> 08:45.759
but they were a family, too.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.195
I couldn't ruin them.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.200
You should be proud.
You did a good deed.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.870
Yeah, well, that good deed
ruin't my life.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.339
That family I took pity on,

08:59.372 --> 09:02.209
they doused
our mattresses with bedbugs.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.945
The Szyslak empire was ruin't.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.214
Soon, we were down
to just a few locations.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.783
My pops never said
how disappointed he was,

09:09.817 --> 09:11.852
but he let me know
in his own way,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.854
by kicking me out
and turning my room

09:13.887 --> 09:16.624
into a home gym he never used.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.292
My brother and sister took
my place in my father's heart.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.562
The only connection I had
with Pops was LinkedIn.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.564
(gasps)
That's worse than nothing.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.700
Why do you think your dad
reached around to you

09:26.734 --> 09:28.368
after all these years?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.938
I don't care.
I don't care so much!

09:30.971 --> 09:32.773
Moe, you will never have peace

09:32.806 --> 09:34.908
until you make up
with your father.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.977
Honey, I need you to hear this:

09:37.010 --> 09:41.281
sticking your nose in Moe's
horrible life will end badly.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.951
Homer, what's your
favorite movie?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.452
Fast & Furious 6.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.420
And what's the theme
of that movie?

09:47.454 --> 09:48.789
Cars.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.457
What's the other theme?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.592
(gasps)
Family.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.094
She's right, Moe.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.830
You got to give your cars
a second chance.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.335
-BART and LISA: Is that
your family's mattress store?
-MOE: No.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.937
Is that your family's
mattress store?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.438
-No.
-Is that your family's
mattress store?

10:05.472 --> 10:06.606
No!

10:06.640 --> 10:07.941
Geez, I never noticed

10:07.975 --> 10:09.910
how many mattress stores
there are.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.345
Yeah, you never do
till you're shopping for one.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.447
Then they're
freakin' everywhere.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.787
That mattress looked perfectly
fine when it was delivered.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.756
It's not my fault
you flipped it over!

10:22.790 --> 10:24.758
Mr. Szyslak,
I've brought someone here

10:24.792 --> 10:27.127
who still cares for you.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.262
Um, hey there, Pops.

10:29.296 --> 10:33.300
I'm, uh, I'm sorry about
shoe-slapping your face and all.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.036
Well, maybe I had it coming.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.637
You hittin' that?

10:37.671 --> 10:40.974
-Can I, uh, say I am?
-Mm-mm.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.112
That must be
Moe's brother and sister.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.782
They don't look ugly like Moe,
but I'm still feeling the ugly.

10:48.816 --> 10:52.519
Ugh. That one's eating
Chinese food with scissors.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.922
(Lisa, Homer and Bart shudder)

10:56.156 --> 10:58.125
Hey, what's Ugly Do-Right
doing here?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.893
He ain't no mattress man.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.964
I will never forgive you for
what you made Dad did to you.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.000
Oh, so we're doing the "what
I done made Dad did" thing?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.036
Because I can did this
all day long!

11:09.069 --> 11:10.670
Shut up, you box springs!

11:10.704 --> 11:12.472
I'm the one what reached around

11:12.505 --> 11:14.374
to this cesspool
of disappointment.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.210
You know, to make amends.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.546
-Amends?!
-Amends?!
-Amends?!

11:19.579 --> 11:22.582
There's no reason
for this to come to shoes!

11:22.615 --> 11:25.018
I want you all
to come to our house

11:25.052 --> 11:26.854
for a family forgiveness dinner.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.255
We'll be there.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.090
Can I bring
a bottle of something?

11:30.123 --> 11:31.759
That would be lovely.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.027
You want oxy or Demerol?

11:34.061 --> 11:35.328
MARGE:
Okay, the brother here,

11:35.362 --> 11:37.330
the father there, Moe here...

11:37.364 --> 11:38.932
No. No good.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
You know,
when this all ends horribly,

11:40.968 --> 11:43.937
it's gonna be pretty hard
not to say "I told you so."

11:43.971 --> 11:45.372
Just don't say it.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.440
You've never been married,
have you, Lisa?

11:47.474 --> 11:49.209
When you love someone very much,

11:49.242 --> 11:52.045
the toughest thing
is not to rub their face

11:52.079 --> 11:54.882
in their horrible screw-ups.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.119
(Marge groaning worriedly)

11:59.152 --> 12:02.722
So, okay, here's a fun game.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.958
Everyone take turns
saying something nice

12:04.992 --> 12:07.427
about a person
they're related to.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.730
I'll start.
Lisa has lovely penmanship.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.866
Thank you, Mom.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.769
Me? Uh, well, it's...

12:15.803 --> 12:19.807
admirable how my stupid father
reached around to this traitor!

12:19.840 --> 12:21.809
I'm impressed
that you better shut up

12:21.842 --> 12:23.676
and make nice with the traitor!

12:25.478 --> 12:28.315
I like that Bart...

12:28.348 --> 12:32.619
uh... Bart is... he, uh...

12:32.652 --> 12:34.788
Can I do two Lisas?

12:34.822 --> 12:37.457
-Dinner fight!
-Yeah, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Huh?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.360
Homer! Go to phase two.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.765
'Twas the sale before Christmas,
and all through the store

12:45.799 --> 12:50.103
All the deals were amazing
on twin sets and more!

12:50.137 --> 12:53.573
(to "Silent Night"):
* Mattress night

12:53.606 --> 12:57.010
* Low, low price

12:57.044 --> 13:00.780
* No payments due, but...

13:00.814 --> 13:02.950
Am I the only one
feeling all oniony

13:02.983 --> 13:04.952
about the way things used to be?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.154
We were dressed
as stinkin' reindeer,

13:07.187 --> 13:09.422
but we were really
a stinkin' family.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.658
Oh, I miss you frigs.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.994
MOE/MARV/MINNIE:
Aw...

13:14.027 --> 13:16.763
Marge, thank you for
reaching around to my family.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.599
I got something
to tell all of youse.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.634
I'm retiring.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.502
(all gasp)

13:22.535 --> 13:23.971
Sleepy is the head

13:24.004 --> 13:25.973
that wears the mattress crown.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.942
That's right,
my springs have sprung.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.644
-To my son, I give a store.
-(gasps)

13:31.678 --> 13:34.948
-To my daughter, I give a store.
-Aw.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.649
Well, good dinner, everyone.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.452
I'll see youse at the funeral
of whoever dies first.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.122
And to my oldest son,
I give a store.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.223
(gasps)

13:43.256 --> 13:46.293
Wha...?
I buried this dream so deep,

13:46.326 --> 13:49.696
no amount of self-harm
could ever carve it out.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.766
Aw.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.969
(inhales deeply)

13:56.003 --> 13:59.006
Oh, the smell
of foam off-gassing.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.442
When I cross this threshold,
I begin a new life!

14:03.776 --> 14:05.412
This is the first time

14:05.445 --> 14:07.915
that I've ever been carried
into a store.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.383
Look at me now,
Lady Foot Locker!

14:10.417 --> 14:11.919
Look at me now.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.927
Hey, everyone.
Hey, thanks for coming out.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.062
Uh, if anybody wants
a glass of wine,

14:22.095 --> 14:23.997
they're on the memory foam.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.234
-(amazed gasps)
-CLETUS: Oh! Hot dang.
My goodness.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.536
Okay, okay, all right,
shut your, shut your faces.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.940
Uh, the commercial that me and
my brother and sister all made

14:32.973 --> 14:35.008
is about to air now.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.743
-I cannot tell a lie.
-("Yankee Doodle" playing)

14:36.776 --> 14:39.346
It's good to be back
in the mattress biz.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.215
Sleep softly
and carry a big discount!

14:42.249 --> 14:44.784
And now we're freeing
the savings!

14:44.817 --> 14:48.521
So rush-more to Mattress King
Slumber Super Stores,

14:48.555 --> 14:52.292
as we all welcome our big
brother Moe back to the family!

14:53.126 --> 14:54.194
MINNIE:
And remember,

14:54.227 --> 14:55.595
at Moe's location,

14:55.628 --> 14:58.865
every mattress
had someone die on it.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.300
(people gasping, murmuring)

15:00.333 --> 15:03.470
-(people groaning)
-Dead-o's on my mattresses?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.939
Hey, hey, somebody messed
with our commercial.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.275
MARV:
Who died on Moe's mattresses?

15:08.308 --> 15:10.277
-Shut-ins. Fat people.
-(people gasping)

15:10.310 --> 15:13.446
MARV and MINNIE:
And inmates! Inmates! Inmates!

15:13.480 --> 15:15.115
No, no, it's all lies!
Come back!

15:15.148 --> 15:16.783
My mattresses are brand-new!

15:16.816 --> 15:18.785
Made in the finest
Filipino sweatshops

15:18.818 --> 15:21.121
by the cutest kids you ever saw!

15:21.154 --> 15:23.223
-That's a gross a-mattress!
-(clamoring)

15:23.256 --> 15:26.626
They betrayed me.
Stabbed me right in the hump.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.228
Sorry, big brother.
(chuckles)

15:28.261 --> 15:31.164
We saw an opportunity to knock
you out of the family business,

15:31.198 --> 15:32.599
and we took it.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.234
It's the Szyslak way.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.236
(laughing)

15:36.269 --> 15:38.505
But I-I brought them together.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.507
How could things end so badly?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.409
HOMER:
Don't say "I told you so."

15:42.442 --> 15:43.910
Don't say "I told you so."
Don't say "I told you so."

15:43.943 --> 15:46.179
Maybe I shouldn't
have gotten involved.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.515
Don't say "I told you so."
Don't say "I told you so."

15:48.548 --> 15:50.183
Why didn't somebody warn me?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.019
Don't say "I told you so."

15:52.052 --> 15:54.487
I told... (choking)

15:59.626 --> 16:02.962
(mattress hissing)

16:02.996 --> 16:05.798
When my pop finds out
I got played for a chump, huh,

16:05.832 --> 16:08.968
he'll wish he never reached
around to me in the first place.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.970
Moe, I'm so sorry.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.306
For the first time,
I'm going to offer you

16:13.340 --> 16:15.175
platonic physical comfort.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.511
-(Moe grunting excitedly)
-(Marge groaning)

16:18.545 --> 16:20.847
I just can't
go through with it.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.383
Aw, it's all right.
You got closer than most.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.053
But I have to believe
it's not too late

16:26.086 --> 16:29.122
to reach around and fix things
with your family.

16:29.156 --> 16:32.059
No, no, no.
I tried things the Marge way.

16:32.092 --> 16:35.328
Now I'm gonna do this
the Szyslak way.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.130
No. No!

16:37.164 --> 16:39.332
That's right, me and my family,

16:39.366 --> 16:41.834
we're going
to the mattresses, baby!

16:43.570 --> 16:45.738
I better go with him.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.974
To make sure I see it.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.477
*

16:50.510 --> 16:52.179
(pop, air hissing)

17:17.437 --> 17:19.872
-(Marge groaning worriedly)
-(Moe and Homer panting)

17:19.906 --> 17:21.874
(gasps) Oh, my God.
What happened?

17:21.908 --> 17:24.211
We cut 'em up good.
(chuckles)

17:24.244 --> 17:26.679
They ain't so pretty no more!

17:26.713 --> 17:28.948
-(Moe chuckles)
-(Marge screams)

17:28.981 --> 17:31.684
All this was just
revenge appetizers!

17:31.718 --> 17:34.187
Tonight is the main course.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.623
And I'm serving it up
family style.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.225
(maniacal laughing)

17:38.258 --> 17:40.960
There's only one man
who can stop this.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.299
Sir, this shirt depicts
an octopus sportfishing

17:46.333 --> 17:48.135
and drinking a mai tai.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.638
It's the bestseller in our
Retired Blowhard collection.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.939
Oh, yeah.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.042
I can see myself
watching golf in this.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.711
Mr. Szyslak Sr.,
you've got to do something!

17:58.745 --> 18:01.581
Your children are
tearing each other apart!

18:01.614 --> 18:03.783
No, no. I'm retired now.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.119
Let them work out
their own little tiffs.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.355
Does this look like a tiff?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
Free mattresses?!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.827
The time for leisure wear
is over.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.632
Mahalo, sir.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.469
Moe's in there, and I've never
seen him this angry before,

18:22.502 --> 18:25.938
not even when he lost
that angriest man contest.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.940
He's crazy!
He's gonna do it!

18:27.974 --> 18:29.976
He's really gonna do it!

18:31.611 --> 18:33.313
I'm up here, Pops.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.782
I'm playing with
my little brother and sister.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.484
Just like old times.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.019
(maniacal laughing)

18:42.522 --> 18:44.624
(gasps)
Hungarian mattress gnashers!

18:44.657 --> 18:49.496
If he releases those bugs,
all our mattresses are ruined!

18:49.529 --> 18:54.334
Not mine. My mattresses
are safe and sound.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.503
-(Barney burps)
-(dog burps)

18:56.536 --> 18:58.971
All my enemies... gnashed!

18:59.005 --> 19:01.274
It's the Szyslak way!

19:01.308 --> 19:03.776
(gasps)
Morty! Do something!

19:03.810 --> 19:06.879
(maniacal laughing)

19:08.881 --> 19:11.351
Do it! Smash that jar!

19:11.384 --> 19:13.786
Take what's rightfully yours!

19:13.820 --> 19:16.456
-Wait, what?
-You wanted him to dooze this?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.891
He's finally man enough
to finish the job,

19:18.925 --> 19:21.361
just like he should've
all those years ago.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.862
Do it, son!

19:22.895 --> 19:24.831
Everything will be yours!

19:24.864 --> 19:27.133
Do it for your king!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.869
(droning):
Do it for your king.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.909
*

19:47.587 --> 19:49.856
I can't do it.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.258
ALL:
Wha...?!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.592
Sorry, Pops.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.428
I guess I'll never live
the Szyslak way.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.566
Oh, Moe, you're a good man.

19:59.599 --> 20:03.035
And these soulless mattress
jackals don't deserve you.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.037
I never thought I'd say this,

20:05.071 --> 20:08.775
but some families
just don't belong together.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.278
-(all grunting)
-Yeah, yeah, I'll kill ya!

20:12.912 --> 20:15.248
