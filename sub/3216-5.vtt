00:04.547 --> 00:06.382
Take your brother outside, fast.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.008
Now, Dean. Go!

00:09.510 --> 00:10.720
JOHN:
Mary! No!

00:12.972 --> 00:14.932
Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.976
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.020
I swore I was done hunting.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.523
I can't do this alone.

00:22.732 --> 00:24.024
(GASPS)

00:24.108 --> 00:25.526
No!

00:27.611 --> 00:28.738
We got work to do.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.866
This is Dad's single
most valuable possession.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.410
Everything he knows
about every evil thing is in here.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.537
He wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:36.746 --> 00:39.582
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:39.790 --> 00:43.210
I gotta find Jessica's killer.
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:43.294 --> 00:46.297
Sam, you know we're gonna
find Dad, right?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.382
Yeah, I know.

TYLER: Okay, your turn. Truth or dare?
-Truth.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.063
Do you wanna make out
with Benjy Swartz?

01:04.231 --> 01:07.276
-Dare.
-Okay, lame.

01:07.485 --> 01:09.653
You have to...

01:09.862 --> 01:11.989
...say "Bloody Mary" in the bathroom.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.366
Is that the best
you can come up with?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.035
Who's Bloody Mary?

01:16.243 --> 01:17.912
She's this witch.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.080
I heard she was a lady
killed in a car crash.

01:20.331 --> 01:21.916
It doesn't matter who she is.

01:22.124 --> 01:25.211
Point is, if you say her name three times
in the bathroom mirror...

01:25.419 --> 01:27.087
...she appears...

01:27.338 --> 01:29.006
...and scratches your eyes out!

01:29.215 --> 01:30.800
(GIRLS GIGGLING)

01:31.467 --> 01:33.928
So why would anyone say it?

01:34.136 --> 01:36.347
Because it isn't real.

01:36.972 --> 01:38.599
No turning on the lights.

01:38.808 --> 01:42.269
And remember: three times.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.462
Bloody Mary.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.132
This is so stupid.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.720
Bloody Mary.

Lily...

02:41.745 --> 02:43.247

02:43.455 --> 02:44.498
Sorry, Daddy.

Sorry, Mr. Shoemaker.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.999
SARI:
You so like him.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.502
Hey, geek.
You guys having fun?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.212
You're out past curfew.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.340
Thanks, Dad.

Why, Sam?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.344
No!

Why, Sam? Why, Sam?

DEAN:
Sam, wake up!

04:33.357 --> 04:35.901
Take it I was having a nightmare.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.278
Yeah. Another one.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.825
Hey, at least I got some sleep.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.828
Sooner or later,
we're gonna have to talk about this.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.413
-We're here?
-Yep.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.999
Welcome to Toledo, Ohio.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.295
SAM: What do you think
happened to this guy?

04:55.379 --> 04:57.631
That's what we're gonna find out.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.218
Let's go.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.374
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.335
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, we're the...

05:35.544 --> 05:36.670
...med students.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.173
-Sorry?
-Oh, Doctor...

05:39.381 --> 05:40.966
...Feiklowicz didn't tell you?

05:41.216 --> 05:42.843
We talked to him on the phone. He--

05:43.052 --> 05:44.261
We're from Ohio State.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.347
He's supposed to show us
the Shoemaker corpse. For our paper.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.142
-Well, I'm sorry. He's at lunch.
-Oh.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.353
Well, he said--
Well, you know, it doesn't matter.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.523
-You don't mind showing us the body?
-Sorry, I can't.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.943
Doc will be back in an hour.
You can wait for him, if you want.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.945
An hour? Ooh.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.740
We gotta be heading back
to Columbus by then.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.784
Look, this paper's half our grade.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.912
-So if you don't mind helping us out--
-Look, man.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.330
No.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.474
Follow me.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.354
Dude, I earned that money.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.106
You won it in a poker game.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.482
Yeah.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.943
Now, the newspaper said
his daughter found him.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.569
She said his eyes were bleeding.

06:42.778 --> 06:46.573
More than that.
They practically liquefied.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.953
DEAN:
Any sign of a struggle?

06:51.161 --> 06:53.539
-Maybe somebody did it to him?
MORGUE TECH: Nope.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.874
Besides the daughter, he was all alone.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.252
What's the official cause of death?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.754
Doc's not sure.
He's thinking massive stroke...

07:00.963 --> 07:02.840
...maybe an aneurysm.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.217
Something burst up in there,
that's for sure.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.595
-What do you mean?
-Intense cerebral bleeding.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.141
This guy had more blood in his skull
than anyone I've ever seen.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.977
But the eyes.
What would cause something like that?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.478
Capillaries can burst.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.939
A lot of bloodshot eyes
with stroke victims.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.608
Yeah, you ever see exploding eyeballs?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.193
That's a first for me.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.612
But, hey, I'm not the doctor.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.574
Hey, think we could look
at the police report?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.701
You know, for our paper.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.620
I'm not really supposed to
show you that.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.503
SAM: Might not be one of ours.
Might just be some freak medical thing.

07:41.587 --> 07:46.341
How many times in Dad's long career
has it been a freak medical thing...

07:46.425 --> 07:49.678
...and not some sign of
awful supernatural death?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.722
Almost never.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.932
-Exactly.
SAM: All right.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.726
Let's go talk to the daughter.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.896
(CHATTERING)

08:04.860 --> 08:07.237
I feel like we're underdressed.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.549
-You must be Donna, right?
-Yeah.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.512
-Hi. We're really sorry.
-Thank you.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.682
I'm Sam. This is Dean.

08:35.766 --> 08:38.060
We worked with your dad.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.521
-You did?
-Yeah. This whole thing....

08:41.730 --> 08:43.649
I mean, a stroke.

08:44.233 --> 08:47.653
-I don't think she really wants to talk.
-It's okay. I'm okay.

08:49.071 --> 08:52.699
Were there ever any symptoms?
Dizziness? Migraines?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.618
No.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.664
-That's because it wasn't a stroke.
-Lily, don't say that.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.875
-What?
-I'm sorry. She's just upset.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.961
No, it happened because of me.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.130
-Sweetie, it didn't.
-Lily...

09:07.214 --> 09:09.675
...why would you say
something like that?

09:09.758 --> 09:11.677
Right before he died, I said it.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.929
-You said what?
-"Bloody Mary."

09:14.137 --> 09:16.682
Three times in the bathroom mirror.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
She took his eyes.
That's what she does.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.647
That's not why Dad died.
This isn't your fault.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.066
I think your sister's right, Lily.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.152
There's no way
it could've been Bloody Mary.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.571
I mean, your dad didn't say it.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.990
Did he?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.784
No, I don't think so.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.853
SAM:
The Bloody Mary Legend.

10:03.729 --> 10:06.106
Dad ever find any evidence
that it was a real thing?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.775
Not that I know of.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.825
SAM:
I mean, everywhere else...

10:16.908 --> 10:20.954
...all over the country,
kids play Bloody Mary...

10:21.038 --> 10:23.248
...and as far as we know,
nobody dies from it.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.585
Maybe everywhere it's a story,
but here it's actually happening.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.004
The place where the legend began?

10:29.838 --> 10:33.216
But according to the legend,
the person who says--

10:35.010 --> 10:37.679
The person who says
you-know-what gets it.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.848
-But here--
-Shoemaker gets it instead.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.558
Right.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.977
Never heard anything like that before.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.646
Still, the guy did die
right in front of the mirror.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.483
And the daughter's right.
The way the legend goes...

10:49.691 --> 10:51.693
...you-know-who scratches
your eyes out.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.112
It's worth checking in to.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.412
What are you doing up here?

11:02.788 --> 11:06.291
We-- We had to go to the bathroom.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.667
Who are you?

11:08.460 --> 11:11.046
Like we said downstairs,
we work with Donna's dad.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.799
He was a day trader or something.
He worked by himself.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.717
No, I know. I meant--

11:15.801 --> 11:18.762
And all those
weird questions downstairs.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.847
What was that?

11:22.015 --> 11:25.602
So you tell me what's going on,
or I start screaming.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.687
-All right.
-All right.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.024
We think something happened
to Donna's dad.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.818
Yeah, a stroke.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.821
That's not the sign of a typical stroke.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.074
We think it might be something else.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.577
-Like what?
-Honestly...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.830
...we don't know yet.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.332
But we don't want it
to happen to anyone else.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.042
That's the truth.

11:49.251 --> 11:52.254
So if you're gonna scream...

11:52.462 --> 11:53.713
...go right ahead.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.259
Who are you, cops?

11:59.886 --> 12:01.930
-Something like that.
-Tell you what.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.516
Here. You think of anything...

12:04.599 --> 12:07.727
...you or your friends notice
anything strange, out of the ordinary...

12:07.978 --> 12:09.855
...just give us a call.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.531
Say Bloody Mary really is
haunting this town.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.491
There's gonna be some proof, right?

12:21.700 --> 12:22.951
A local woman who died nasty.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.078
But a legend this widespread,
it's hard.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.164
There's like 50 versions
of who she is.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.166
One says she's a witch,
another says...

12:29.374 --> 12:31.877
...she's a mutilated bride.
There's a lot more.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.670
So, what are we looking for?

12:33.879 --> 12:37.048
Every version's got things in common.
It's always a woman named Mary.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.509
And she always dies
right in front of a mirror.

12:39.718 --> 12:43.054
We gotta search newspapers,
public records, as far back as they go...

12:43.263 --> 12:45.515
...see if we can find a Mary
who fits the bill.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.393
-Well, that sounds annoying.
-No, it won't be so bad...

12:48.643 --> 12:50.270
...as long as we....

12:51.771 --> 12:55.692
Huh, I take it back.
This will be very annoying.

12:57.652 --> 13:00.947
I'm not sure. They were cops
or detectives or something.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.991
JILL:
Whoever they were, they were cute.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.118
CHARLIE (ON PHONE): Jill.
-You didn't think so?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.746
Yeah, okay, they were cute, but still...

13:07.954 --> 13:10.832
...do you think something could have
happened to Donna's dad?

13:10.916 --> 13:12.751
JILL (ON PHONE):
Maybe Lily was right.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.003
Maybe Bloody Mary got him.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.880
Ha, ha. Very funny.

13:17.714 --> 13:23.011
Wait, I'm sorry.
Was that fear I hear in your voice?

13:23.094 --> 13:24.179
No.

13:25.222 --> 13:28.183
Charlie, I'm walking
to the bathroom mirror right now.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.560
Jill, quit it.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.149
Oh, no. I can't help myself.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.860
I'm gonna say it.

13:38.944 --> 13:42.364
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary...

13:42.447 --> 13:45.825
...Bloody Mary.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.954
Jill?

13:51.623 --> 13:52.958
(SCREAMING ON PHONE)

13:53.041 --> 13:55.085
Jill!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.380
(JILL LAUGHS)

13:58.630 --> 14:01.591
You're such a freak.
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.055
(GASPING)

14:56.104 --> 14:58.231
You did it.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.653
You killed that boy.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.427
JESSICA:
Why, Sam?

15:31.056 --> 15:32.599
Why'd you let me fall asleep?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.435
Because I'm an awesome brother.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.480
So, what did you dream about?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.483
Lollipops and candy canes.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.986
Yeah, sure.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.491
You find anything?

15:49.699 --> 15:52.410
Oh, besides a whole new level
of frustration?

15:52.619 --> 15:55.830
No. I've looked at everything.

15:56.706 --> 16:00.585
A few local women, Laura and Cathryn,
committed suicide in front of a mirror.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.756
And a giant mirror fell on
a guy named Dave, but...

16:05.507 --> 16:07.384
...no Mary.

(SIGHS)

16:10.512 --> 16:12.639
Maybe we just haven't found it yet.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.434
I've also been searching for
strange deaths in the area.

16:16.643 --> 16:21.147
You know, eyeball bleeding,
that sort of thing. There's nothing.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.525
Whatever's happening here
maybe just ain't Mary.

Hello?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.539
(SOBBING)

16:37.914 --> 16:41.501
And they found her
on the bathroom floor.

16:41.918 --> 16:45.547
And her-- Her eyes.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.133
They were gone.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.135
I'm sorry.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.346
And she said it.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.641
I heard her say it.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.146
But it couldn't be because of that.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.607
I'm insane, right?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.027
No, you're not insane.

17:08.236 --> 17:11.448
God, that makes me feel
so much worse.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.199
Look.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.912
We think something's happening here.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.832
Something that can't be explained.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.626
And we're gonna stop it.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.421
But we could use your help.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.856
What did you tell Jill's mom?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.693
I just said I needed some time alone
with Jill's pictures and things.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.570
I hate lying to her.

What are you guys looking for?

17:59.329 --> 18:01.331
We'll let you know
as soon as we find it.

Hey, night vision.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.253
SAM:
Thanks. Perfect.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.716
Do I look like Paris Hilton?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.563
So I don't get it.
I mean, the first victim...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.650
...didn't summon Mary,
and the second victim did.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.401
How is she choosing them?

18:30.485 --> 18:31.694
Beats me.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.034
I wanna know why
Jill said it in the first place.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.370
It was just a joke.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.040
Well, somebody's gonna say it again.
It's just a matter of time.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.512
SAM:
Hey.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.515
There's a black light
in the trunk, right?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.080
Gary Bryman?

19:25.540 --> 19:26.749
You know who that is?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.210
No.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.305
So Gary Bryman
was an 8-year-old boy.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.724
Two years ago,
he was killed in a hit-and-run.

19:42.807 --> 19:46.227
The car was described as
a black Toyota Camry...

19:46.311 --> 19:48.813
...but nobody got the plates
or saw the driver.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.732
Oh, my God.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.776
-What?
-Jill drove that car.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.323
We need to get
to your friend Donna's house.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.084
SAM:
Linda Shoemaker.

20:12.629 --> 20:16.215
-Why are you asking me this?
-Look, we're sorry, but it's important.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.135
Yeah. Linda's my mom, okay?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.888
And she overdosed on sleeping pills.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.848
It was an accident, and that's it.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.895
-I think you should leave.
-Donna, just--

20:28.978 --> 20:30.229
Just get out of my house!

20:34.025 --> 20:35.735
Oh, my God.

20:35.944 --> 20:39.447
Do you really think her dad
could've killed her mom?

20:40.156 --> 20:41.699
Maybe.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.952
I think I should stick around.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.704
All right. Whatever you do, don't....

20:46.913 --> 20:49.791
Believe me, I won't say it.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.756
Wait, wait, wait.
You're doing a nationwide search?

20:56.965 --> 21:00.426
Yep. The NCIC, the FBI database.

21:00.635 --> 21:04.222
At this point, any Mary who died in front
of a mirror is good enough for me.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.558
But if she's haunting the town,
she should've died in the town.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.395
There's nothing local.
Unless you got a better idea....

21:10.603 --> 21:13.898
-It seems like there's a pattern.
-I was thinking the same thing.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.944
-Mr. Shoemaker and Jill's hit-and-run--
-Both had secrets where people died.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.072
There's folklore about mirrors.
They reveal your lies...

21:21.155 --> 21:23.950
...your secrets.
They're a true reflection of your soul...

21:24.033 --> 21:25.702
...which is why it's bad luck
to break them.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.828
Right, right.

21:26.911 --> 21:31.207
So maybe if you've got a secret,
like a real nasty one, then Mary sees it...

21:31.290 --> 21:34.794
-...and punishes you for it.
-Whether you summoned her or not.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.587
Take a look at this.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.019
Looks like the same handprint.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.396
Her name was Mary Worthington.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.858
An unsolved murder in
Fort Wayne, Indiana.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.861
JACKSON:
I was on the job for 35 years.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.905
Detective for most of that.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.616
Now, everybody packs it in
with a few loose ends.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.703
But the Mary Worthington murder...

22:09.245 --> 22:10.830
...that one still gets me.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.790
What exactly happened?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.460
You boys said you were reporters.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.838
We know Mary was 19,
lived by herself.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.216
She won a few beauty contests.
Dreamt of getting out of Indiana...

22:22.425 --> 22:26.054
...being an actress.
And we know the night of March 29th...

22:26.137 --> 22:29.766
...someone broke into her apartment
and murdered her.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.476
Cut out her eyes with a knife.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.020
That's right.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.149
When we ask you what happened,
we wanna know what...

22:38.357 --> 22:40.443
...you think happened.

22:42.737 --> 22:46.074
JACKSON: Technically, I'm not
supposed to have a copy of this.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.331
Now...

22:54.082 --> 22:55.333
...see that there?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.127
-"T-R-E"?
-Yeah.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.963
I think Mary was trying to
spell the name of her killer.

23:01.047 --> 23:04.467
-You know who it was?
-Not for sure.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.720
But there was a local man,
a surgeon.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.597
Trevor Samson.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.974
And I think he cut her up good.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.310
Now, why would he do
something like that?

23:14.519 --> 23:17.313
Her diary mentioned
a man that she was seeing.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.899
She called him by his initial, T.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.361
Well, her last entry...

23:23.569 --> 23:26.405
...she was gonna tell T's wife
all about their affair.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.325
But how do you know it was
this guy Samson who killed her?

23:29.534 --> 23:31.994
It's hard to say.

23:33.287 --> 23:36.791
But the way her eyes were cut out,
it was almost professional.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.168
But you could never prove it?

23:39.377 --> 23:42.922
No. No prints, no witnesses.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.423
He was meticulous.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.010
Is he still alive?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.721
Nope.

23:52.265 --> 23:56.978
If you ask me,
Mary spent her last living moments...

23:57.186 --> 24:00.398
...trying to expose this guy's secret.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.943
But she never could.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.154
Where's she buried?

24:07.655 --> 24:10.199
She wasn't. She was cremated.

24:13.035 --> 24:16.080
What about that mirror?
It's not in some evidence lockup, is it?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.208
No.

24:19.417 --> 24:23.212
It was returned to Mary's family
a long time ago.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.048
You have the names of her family,
by any chance?

They were only trying to help.
Please, Donna, you have to believe me.

to believe this crap. She's 12.

And the way Jill died.

Okay, so Bloody Mary...

24:59.457 --> 25:02.877
-No!
-...Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.048
See? Nothing happened.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.716
Why would you do that?

25:08.799 --> 25:10.092
Oh, my God.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.970
There really is something
wrong with you.

25:26.317 --> 25:30.988
Elements that lose electrons
become positive ions...

25:31.197 --> 25:34.867
...which are smaller than other atoms
of the same element.

25:35.076 --> 25:40.665
Therefore, the ionic radius is smaller
than the atomic radius.

Okay. Well, maybe next time.
All right, thanks.

-So?
-So that was Mary's brother.

26:18.411 --> 26:22.373
The mirror was in the family for years
until he sold it.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.750
One week ago.

26:25.126 --> 26:28.963
To a store called Estate Antiques.
A store in Toledo.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.717
So wherever the mirror goes,
Mary goes?

26:32.925 --> 26:35.177
Her spirit's definitely
tied up with it somehow.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.806
Isn't there an old superstition that says
mirrors can capture spirits?

26:39.056 --> 26:40.766
When someone
would die in a house...

26:40.975 --> 26:44.145
...people would cover the mirrors
so the ghost wouldn't get trapped.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.814
Mary dies in front of a mirror,
it draws in her spirit.

26:46.897 --> 26:50.151
Yeah, but how can she move through,
like, a hundred different mirrors?

26:50.359 --> 26:54.405
I don't know, but if the mirror's a
source, I say we find it and smash it.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.521
We were in the bathroom.
Donna said it.

That's not what we're talking about.

Where someone got hurt.

28:28.916 --> 28:30.167
Can you tell us about it?

28:34.171 --> 28:35.714
I had this boyfriend.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.844
I loved him...

28:41.345 --> 28:43.889
...but he kind of scared me too,
you know?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.892
And one night...

28:47.101 --> 28:50.938
...at his house, we got in this fight...

28:52.106 --> 28:54.400
...and I broke up with him.

28:54.608 --> 28:58.195
And he got upset,
and he said he needed me...

28:58.404 --> 28:59.947
...and he loved me.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.491
And he said:

29:02.700 --> 29:06.120
"Charlie, if you walk out that door
right now, I'm gonna kill myself."

29:08.706 --> 29:11.292
And do you know what I said?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.211
I said, "Go ahead."

29:16.130 --> 29:18.257
And I left.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.052
How could I say that?

How could I leave him like that?

I just--

29:33.981 --> 29:36.775
I didn't believe him, you know?

someone died.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.889
That's good enough for Mary.

30:07.097 --> 30:08.265
I guess.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.768
You know, I've been thinking.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.354
It might not be enough
to just smash that mirror.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.439
Why? What do you mean?

30:15.523 --> 30:18.567
Well, Mary's hard to pin down.
She moves from mirror to mirror.

30:18.651 --> 30:22.321
So who's to say that she's not gonna
just keep hiding in them forever?

30:22.988 --> 30:25.032
So maybe...

30:25.407 --> 30:28.118
...we should try to pin her down.

You know, summon her to her mirror...

30:31.205 --> 30:32.456
...and then smash it.

-How do you know that's gonna work?
-I don't.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.462
Not for sure.

You think that's your dirty little secret?
That you killed her somehow?

31:13.163 --> 31:15.583
Sam, this has gotta stop, man.

31:16.959 --> 31:22.298
I mean, the nightmares and calling her
name out in the middle of the night...

31:22.506 --> 31:24.550
...it's gonna kill you.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.177
Now, listen to me.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.846
It wasn't your fault.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.684
If you wanna blame something,
then blame the thing that killed her.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.771
Hell, why don't you take a swing at me.
I dragged you away from her.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.398
I don't blame you.

31:39.732 --> 31:43.068
You shouldn't blame yourself.
There's nothing you could've done.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.446
-I could've warned her.
-About what?

31:45.654 --> 31:48.198
You didn't know what
was gonna happen.

31:48.782 --> 31:52.202
And besides, all of this isn't a secret.
I mean, I know all about it.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.912
It's not gonna work with Mary.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.998
No, you don't.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.877
-I don't what?
-You don't know all about it.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.463
I haven't told you everything.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.507
What are you talking about?

32:05.591 --> 32:09.261
Well, it wouldn't really be a secret
if I told you, would it?

32:14.892 --> 32:16.393
No.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.647
I don't like it. It's not gonna happen.
Forget it.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.567
Dean, that girl back there
is going to die...

32:23.651 --> 32:27.488
...unless we do something about it.
And you know what?

32:27.571 --> 32:31.575
Who knows how many more people
are gonna die after that?

32:31.825 --> 32:34.036
Now, we're doing this.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.166
You've got to let me do this.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.355
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:05.442 --> 33:09.196
Well, that's just great.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.748
All right, let's start looking.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.580
Maybe they've already sold it.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.712
I don't think so.

34:19.183 --> 34:20.684
DEAN:
That's it.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.355
You sure about this?

34:41.205 --> 34:42.456
Bloody Mary.

34:45.459 --> 34:47.377
Bloody Mary.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.014
Bloody Mary.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.862
I'll go check that out, you stay here.
Be careful.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.491
Smash anything that moves.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.795
Crap.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.380
(CAR APPROACHING)

35:47.729 --> 35:50.148
SECURITY GUARD: Hold it!
-Whoa, guys.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.860
False alarm. I tripped the system.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.361
SECURITY GUARD:
Who are you?

35:54.528 --> 35:55.696
I'm the boss's kid.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.116
You're Mr. Yamashiro's kid?

36:14.590 --> 36:16.216
Come on.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.552
Come into this one.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.613
(GASPS AND GROANS)

36:41.783 --> 36:43.785
It's your fault.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.829
You killed her.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.376
You killed Jessica.

36:53.837 --> 36:57.841
-Like I said, I was adopted.
-Yeah.

36:59.843 --> 37:03.847
You know, I just-- I really don't
have time for this right now.

37:05.015 --> 37:06.183
(GRUNTING)

37:10.020 --> 37:12.773
You never told her the truth,
who you really were.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.984
But it's more than that, isn't it?

37:16.485 --> 37:18.278
Those nightmares you've been having...

37:18.487 --> 37:20.238
...of Jessica dying...

37:20.447 --> 37:22.074
...screaming...

37:22.282 --> 37:23.951
...burning.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.162
You had them for days
before she died.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.705
Didn't you?

37:29.164 --> 37:30.207
(GROANING)

37:30.832 --> 37:32.542
You were so desperate to be normal...

37:32.793 --> 37:35.045
...to believe they were just dreams.

37:35.128 --> 37:37.172
How could you ignore them like that?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.175
How could you leave her alone to die?

37:42.427 --> 37:44.513
You dreamt it would happen!

37:45.055 --> 37:46.640
(DEAN YELLS)

(GASPING)

37:52.354 --> 37:54.731
Sammy? Sammy?

37:55.565 --> 37:57.109
It's Sam.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.071
-God. You okay?
-Yeah.

38:02.531 --> 38:03.907
Come on, come on.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.200

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

38:31.560 --> 38:33.603
(GROANING)

39:06.636 --> 39:09.014
You killed them.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.141
All those people.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.644
You killed them.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.565
(GASPING)

39:42.172 --> 39:43.632
Hey, Sam?

39:43.840 --> 39:45.592
Yeah?

39:46.093 --> 39:49.221
This has gotta be like, what,
600 years bad luck?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.498
So this is really over?

40:18.250 --> 40:19.793
Yeah, it's over.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.712
Thank you.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.517
Charlie.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.690
Your boyfriend's death....

40:41.898 --> 40:44.067
You really should try
to forgive yourself.

40:44.276 --> 40:48.655
No matter what you did,
you probably couldn't have stopped it.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.241
Sometimes bad things just happen.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.546
That's good advice.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.646
Hey, Sam?

41:22.105 --> 41:23.773
Yeah?

41:24.024 --> 41:26.109
Now that this is all over...

41:26.318 --> 41:29.279
...I want you to tell me
what that secret was.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.076
Look.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.662
You're my brother...

41:38.038 --> 41:40.165
...and I'd die for you.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.794
But there are some things
I need to keep to myself.
