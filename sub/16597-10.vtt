00:04.656 --> 00:06.397
Molly.
I found boy for you.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.660
What? Why?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.010
At the Korean barber.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.837
I go twice a week for trim
upstairs and downstairs.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.189
Hair and mustache.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.278
Longest second of my life.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.541
His name is Jae.
He's my barber's grandson.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.846
He's perfect for you.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.413
He's Korean and a boy.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.591
Oh. Thanks,
but I'm good for now.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.332
I really want
to start college single.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.073
So you can study a lot
and have no distractions?

00:31.422 --> 00:32.554
Yeah!

00:33.859 --> 00:35.687
He also has
bad-boy vibe.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.254
Very sexy!

00:38.473 --> 00:40.214
Grandpa,
I don't think you get it.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.606
She wants to focus
on her studies.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.089
I don't know how I feel
about your dad setting
Molly up.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.178
Eh, It's a Korean thing.
He used to set me up.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.137
It was a Dumpster fire
every time.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.139
That's how I knew
you were the one.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.444
When am I gonna know
you're the one?

00:55.664 --> 00:57.274
I'm glad your dad
feels at home here,

00:57.318 --> 01:00.408
but he needs to ask
before he just does things.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.453
He's been digging a hole
in the backyard for a week

01:02.497 --> 01:04.934
and won't tell anyone why.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.676
And, despite what
our grocery list
clearly states,

01:07.719 --> 01:10.287
he buys crunchy instead
of creamy peanut butter.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.376
I hate crunchy.
You can't spread it.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.682
Fine.
I won't tell anyone.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.252
I almost forgot,
I bought you some new jeans.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.079
Boot cut is out.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.169
I know.
She's stuck in the '90s.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.649
Say hi to Smash Mouth
for me.

01:24.693 --> 01:28.262
Okay, well, I'm headed to
the wellness seminar.

01:28.305 --> 01:30.177
Call me after
and let me know how it went.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.526
How what went?

01:31.569 --> 01:33.397
Tell me you didn't forget.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.833
I didn't forget.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.226
What didn't I forget?

01:36.270 --> 01:38.098
Dave's parent-teacher
conference.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.577
You promised
you'd cover it.

01:39.621 --> 01:42.450
I would if I could, but I'm
draining Mr. Jacobs' knee.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.539
It's his daughter's wedding
this weekend,

01:44.582 --> 01:46.497
and he can't do the
Achy Breaky Heart
on crutches.

01:46.541 --> 01:50.066
I mean, I could,
but I'm an exceptional dancer.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.503
How does that work its way
into every conversation?

01:52.547 --> 01:54.462
I don't know, Allison.
I guess I'm just that good.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.639
I can go
to Dave's conference.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.119
No. No.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.904
That's very nice, but it's
a parent/teacher conference.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.645
I'm a parent.

02:03.688 --> 02:04.863
[GASPS]
Good point, Papa.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.562
I'll leave you
to discuss.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.693
I...

02:11.348 --> 02:12.915
My dad can handle it.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.396
I mean, he went to all
my parent/teacher conferences,

02:15.439 --> 02:17.093
and Dave's are just about
how great he is.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.529
Pretty different than mine.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.271
"Ken doesn't sit still.
He talks too much.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.404
"But, man, is he
an exceptional dancer."

02:24.318 --> 02:25.536
Fine!

02:25.580 --> 02:27.321
Dad, you're in.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.845
That's why I get mustache
trimmed twice a week.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.281
You never know.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.936
Just get the facts, okay?

02:33.979 --> 02:35.285
And try to smile.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.721
I smile all the time.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.332
I'm smiling right now.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.638
Great.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.859
Oh. And can you also pick up
some creamy peanut butter?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.774
Creamy peanut butter
is a rip-off!

02:45.817 --> 02:47.254
Where's the nuts?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.823
Okay, I love you guys, too.
Bye.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

02:56.350 --> 02:57.307
Chello?

02:58.003 --> 03:00.441
Oh, hi, Dr. Yee.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.138
Mm-hmm. I did see
Mr. Hubert's blood work.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.358
It seemed fine.
I called him.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.101
No, I didn't know
Mr. Hubert had a history
of prostate cancer.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.929
It wasn't in his file.
I didn't...

03:10.973 --> 03:12.409
Excuse me?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.629
You're accusing me
of making a mistake?

03:14.672 --> 03:17.545
Whoa! Dr. Park
doesn't make mistakes, son,

03:17.588 --> 03:19.808
so you must have
the wrong number.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.897
Yes, obviously,
it's the right number.
I answered it.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.855
That was just a colorful way
of making my point.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.734
Well, you must be
a very proud grandpa.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.126
[CHUCKLES]

03:34.170 --> 03:37.304
Dave's so bright
and engaged.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.088
I've been teaching
a long time,

03:39.131 --> 03:41.612
and you don't come across
many Dave Parks.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.440
Oh, and his smile,

03:43.484 --> 03:45.834
I love his smile.
[CHUCKLES]

03:45.877 --> 03:48.140
Smiling is overvalued
by Americans.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.666
Well, okay. Maybe.
[CHUCKLES]

03:51.709 --> 03:53.755
But he has a good one.
[CHUCKLES]

03:53.798 --> 03:56.192
And Dave's easily getting
straight A's,

03:56.236 --> 03:57.759
so no complaints here.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.630
Well, complaints here.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.764
Excuse me?

04:02.807 --> 04:04.200
This work is nonsense.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.550
He's not feeling
challenged.

04:06.594 --> 04:09.858
Well, I'm certainly feeling
challenged in this moment.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.036
No student
should get straight
A's so easy

04:14.079 --> 04:16.908
and smile all the time.

04:16.952 --> 04:20.390
I promise I create
a challenging environment.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.218
Me too!

04:24.481 --> 04:26.701
And what is
the capital of Peru?

04:26.744 --> 04:28.877
Lima!Right again, Dave.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.139
Great job.

04:33.882 --> 04:36.624
And who knows
the capital of Argentina?

04:37.189 --> 04:38.321
That's it?

04:38.365 --> 04:41.585
No, no, no, no.
That's too easy.

04:41.629 --> 04:44.284
Make Dave list all of Peru's
bordering countries

04:44.327 --> 04:46.416
and major exports,
in Spanish.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.420
Mr. Park,
as we discussed,

04:50.464 --> 04:53.336
the school allows
silent observers in class.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.035
So when the hand goes up,
the mouth goes...

04:57.079 --> 05:00.125
That may work
with these sheep,
but it's not gonna work on me.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.562
Dave know this stuff
already.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.825
But the other students don't.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.957
That's their problem!

05:06.001 --> 05:07.829
When they grow up,
they'll be working for him!

05:10.135 --> 05:12.703
Okay, thanks, Grandpa.

05:12.747 --> 05:15.576
By the way, the capital
of Argentina is Buenos Aires.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.753
Guess we're past that.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.719
I can't believe
that weasel-faced urologist,

05:28.763 --> 05:31.156
calling me at home,
accusing me of making
a mistake.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.767
Wait. I thought
you never met him before.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.073
I haven't, but I could
tell he has a weasel face
over the phone.

05:35.117 --> 05:38.076
That's how powerful
it is.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.775
I obviously didn't know
Mr. Hubert had a history
of prostate cancer,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.559
or I would have known
his PSA should have been zero

05:42.603 --> 05:44.431
before it was sent
to the urologist for review.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.780
Right?

05:45.823 --> 05:48.870
It's like "urine" the wrong,
Weasel Face!

05:48.913 --> 05:51.307
[BOTH LAUGH]

05:51.351 --> 05:53.265
To be clear,
I'm only laughing because
it supports my point.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.269
So,
Dave's principal called.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.706
There was a fight
at school.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.099
Get it, Dave!

06:01.143 --> 06:03.188
It wasn't Dave.
It was Ken's dad.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.799
Get it, Ken's dad!

06:06.104 --> 06:08.411
He caused a disturbance,
demeaned children,

06:08.455 --> 06:10.587
and said he'd stop
when he was dead.

06:10.631 --> 06:12.850
Ha! Classic Papa.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.722
This is why I didn't want him
going to Dave's conference.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.071
You have to talk
to him tonight

06:16.114 --> 06:17.681
and tell him
how out-of-line he was.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.901
I will totally do that
and not sit in the driveway

06:19.944 --> 06:21.468
until I think
you've already done it.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.385
Ha! Here it is.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.865
Mr. Hubert's
medical intake form.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.127
Zoink!

06:29.171 --> 06:31.652
This will vindicate me.
[CHUCKLES]

06:31.695 --> 06:34.437
Right under "medical history,"
it says...

06:36.526 --> 06:37.832
"prostate cancer."

06:37.875 --> 06:38.746
Damn it!

06:38.789 --> 06:40.095
Aw, man.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.489
Ken, it's okay.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.447
Luckily, Mr. Hubert
has no symptoms

06:44.491 --> 06:45.927
and is being followed up
with appropriate treatment

06:45.970 --> 06:47.145
by Dr. Yee.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.321
But he was my patient.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.236
Okay,
just get ahold of I.T.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.238
We got to make sure
oversights like this
never happen again.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.979
Will do. Right away.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.027
Hey. Hey!

Everybody makes mistakes.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.597
Hmm? No. Impossible.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.337
There are no mistakes
at Welltopia...

07:05.381 --> 07:09.037
just acts of God
we could never
legally anticipate.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.432
Well, I made a mistake,
and not a small one.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.609
Call Mr. Hubert.
I want to apologize.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.784
Whoa! Whoa.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.090
There are no apologies
at Welltopia.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.005
No, an apology is
an admission of fault.

07:21.049 --> 07:23.573
Mr. Hubert? Please hold.
I got him on the line.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.619
I got this. Hello.
This is Pat Hein.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.229
I'm the supervisor
here at Welltopia,

07:27.272 --> 07:29.971
and I just want to say
from the bottom of my heart,

07:30.014 --> 07:32.016
I understand
that you were dealt
a bad hand,

07:32.060 --> 07:34.715
but all's well
that ends well.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.847
Okay, then.
You have a good day.

07:39.415 --> 07:41.678
"All's well that ends well"?

07:41.722 --> 07:43.201
Yes, Ken.

07:43.245 --> 07:46.814
That's what we at
Welltopia call a statement
of non-apology.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.773
It pacifies the patient
without admitting legal fault.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.688
You're welcome
to say things like

07:51.732 --> 07:55.431
"I regret your misfortune"
or "Ooh! Tough stuff, buddy."

07:57.041 --> 07:58.826
This is ridiculous, Pat.
Mr. Hubert could have died.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.175
Bup, bup!

08:00.218 --> 08:02.569
No one dies at Welltopia.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.309
They just become
inactive patients.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.403
Oh. Hello.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.710
Mm.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.756
Anything you want to tell me
about Dave's conference today?

08:16.583 --> 08:18.367
I smiled the whole time.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.108
Bad advice.
Did not go over well.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.591
Are you sure
it was the smiling
that didn't go over well,

08:24.634 --> 08:25.983
or could it have been

08:26.027 --> 08:28.551
you insisting everyone
at school was bad
at their jobs?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.032
Seems like
the smiling thing.

08:32.816 --> 08:35.776
Come on!
Don't you think Dave
should be challenged more?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.604
Maybe he could be,
but I'm not sure

08:37.647 --> 08:39.954
calling Miss Flanagan
a glorified babysitter

08:39.997 --> 08:41.259
is the way to get there.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.696
I never said "glorified."

08:44.132 --> 08:45.568
Great. You're home.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.352
Why don't the two of you
have a chat,

08:47.396 --> 08:49.354
while I call everyone
on Dave's class phone tree

08:49.398 --> 08:50.965
and tell them
they're not sheep?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.314
But they are!

08:56.579 --> 08:58.450
Dad,
what were you thinking?

08:58.494 --> 08:59.930
I was just trying
to help.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.411
Even if you're trying to help,
Park men aren't always

09:02.454 --> 09:04.500
the perfect gods
we believe ourselves to be.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.937
Sometimes
we make mistakes.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.984
Sometimes they're big mistakes
we really should have caught.

09:10.027 --> 09:11.768
I really think
it was the smiling thing.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.384
Well, talked to my dad.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.473
How'd it go?Excellent.

09:21.517 --> 09:24.520
He was quick to see
the error of his ways
and pledged to do better.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.261
Really?No. He's my dad.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.570
What's wrong with you?

but, I can't do it.

09:40.318 --> 09:41.493

09:41.537 --> 09:43.626
Next time, just don't forget
about the conference.

Oh, no,
it's not about that.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.934
That was totally on you
for not reminding me.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.634
It's about a patient.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.245
I missed an abnormal PSA.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.812
Oh, Ken. Really?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.510
It was right there
in his chart.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.251
I never make mistakes
like this.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.776
[SIGHS]

10:02.819 --> 10:05.256
I know it's hard,
but you're gonna get
through this.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.345
I'm so sorry.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.130
How's the patient doing?

10:09.173 --> 10:10.871
He's asymptomatic.
He's getting treatment
tomorrow.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.524
Well, that's a relief.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.179
No symptoms? Sounds like
he's gonna be fine.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.486
Yeah. You're right.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.575
[SCOFFS]

10:19.619 --> 10:21.446
Maybe I'm just
blowing it out of proportion.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.057
You're being sued.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.675
Mr. Hubert's suing me?
I'm being sued?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.242
I'm just gonna
close this.

10:37.027 --> 10:40.552
This is why we don't apologize
for mistakes we never made.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.033
Or maybe he never
would have sued at all if
I had apologized.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.295
Yes! Preach!

10:45.383 --> 10:46.907
Or he would have sued
anyway,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.648
and you'd be on record
admitting fault.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
Yes! Preach!

10:50.737 --> 10:52.652
Sorry. I'm so easily swayed.

10:54.088 --> 10:57.482
Ken, just lay low,
all right?

10:57.526 --> 10:59.789
Thanks to your nagging,
the new system's
already in place,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.748
and the problem's
been solved.

11:01.791 --> 11:02.923
Just let the lawyers
handle it.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.838
Those sick bastards
love this sort of thing.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.230
But this doesn't seem right.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.319
I'm sorry, Ken.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.452
Let me rephrase that.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.541
Ooh.
Tough stuff, buddy.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.370
But it's company policy.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.330
I get it.
I'm a Welltopia employee.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.335
But I'm a doctor first.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.772
Find Mr. Hubert.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.034
Yes! Preach!

11:28.252 --> 11:29.166
He won me back.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.739
What's going on?
I had to cancel a session
to come down here.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.523
I figured out a way
to fix everything.

11:38.567 --> 11:41.178
Sixth grade's too easy.
Dave could move to
seventh grade.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.876
They just need
your signature.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.792
What? No! I don't want him
skipping a year.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.532
But Dave is so excited.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.143
You already told him?

11:49.186 --> 11:51.362
Here, kid. I won't be
needing this where I'm going.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.017
Mommy, did you hear?

11:54.061 --> 11:55.627
I got promoted
to seventh grade!

11:55.671 --> 11:57.194
Which is perfect,

11:57.238 --> 11:58.979
because in seventh grade,
you can take robotics,

11:59.022 --> 12:00.981
and as the club motto goes,

12:01.024 --> 12:03.984
"The best way to make friends
is to build them."

12:04.027 --> 12:06.290
I'm sorry, Dave.
You're not moving up a grade.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.336
But Grandpa said I...Grandpa doesn't
get to decide.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.816
Why?Why?

12:10.860 --> 12:12.035
Because I'm your parent.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.994
I get to decide
what grade you're in

12:14.037 --> 12:15.430
and what consistency
your peanut butter is.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.649
Whatever.

12:17.693 --> 12:18.912
Great job, Mommy!

12:24.569 --> 12:25.440
Sorry for the up-and-back.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.446
Clark.Yeah.

12:31.489 --> 12:32.752
You seen Dr. Park?

12:34.797 --> 12:37.452
Yeah, I have seen Ken,
a bunch.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.932
That's pretty vague

12:38.975 --> 12:41.282
for someone charged with
knowing his whereabouts.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.805
Damona.Huh?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.417
Have you seen Ken?

12:46.461 --> 12:48.593
Yeah.
I mean, he's skinny, so, you
know, he's very easy to miss,

12:48.637 --> 12:49.769
but, yeah, I've seen him.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.338
Uh... [COUGHS]

something on your computer?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.696
Uh...No, I was...

13:04.740 --> 13:07.090
No, he's, um,
he's looking at porn.

Porn, yeah.Porn, Yes.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.746
Nasty stuff.DAMONA: It is.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.052
This is really,
It's pretty bad.

13:14.532 --> 13:15.882
PAT: Oh, yeah.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.623
It's that
bowling-themed porn.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.627
Starring our patient
Mr. Hubert and his
bowling league

13:22.671 --> 13:26.980
that apparently meets
tonight at Pins N' Things
in Long Beach.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.112
Yeah, I like it
when there's a story.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.465
[PINS CRASH]

13:37.468 --> 13:40.515
Ken! Ken, Ken, Ken, Ken,
Ken, Ken, Ken!

13:40.558 --> 13:42.212
What are you guys
doing here?Pat knows you're here.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.693
We tried to call you,
but he's on his way.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.565
And his eye was doing
that twitching thing,
so he means business.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.176
Or he just has to pee.
One of the two.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.919
Okay.
Then it's now or never.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.879
Excuse me.
Mr. Hubert?

13:56.923 --> 13:58.794
Dr. Park.
What are you doing here?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.013
Looking for you.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.492
How'd you find me?

14:01.536 --> 14:03.016
Oh, I Facebook-stalked you
and saw

14:03.059 --> 14:04.365
that your bowling league
met tonight.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
And, uh,
happy belated birthday.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.586
Thank you!

14:08.630 --> 14:09.674
Aren't you his nurse?

14:09.718 --> 14:10.850
And friend.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.634
And you're his friend,
too?

14:12.677 --> 14:17.639
No. I just drove all the way
down to Long Beach to bowl.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.424
Look, my lawyer told me
not to talk to anybody
from Welltopia, so...

14:20.468 --> 14:23.906
Okay, look, Mr. Hubert,
I came here to say I'm...

14:23.950 --> 14:25.299
An idiot.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.517
I mean, as a man.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.476
As a doctor,
he's legally beyond reproach.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.827
Walk with me, dummy.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.791
Ken,
you cannot do this.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.793
You cannot apologize
to that patient.

14:41.837 --> 14:43.404
I have to.
He deserves better...

14:43.447 --> 14:44.753
Ken, listen to me.

14:44.796 --> 14:47.234
If you apologize to him,
you will lose your job.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.976
Then you will not be
able to give any care
to any patient.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.891
Now,
who's that gonna help?

14:51.934 --> 14:54.110
I knew
that twitch meant business.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.069
Be scared, little man.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.462
Yeah, but go with
your heart, big man.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.160

I'm just trying to
build him up.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.988
I don't know
what you're all doing here,

15:02.031 --> 15:03.250

uncomfortable,

15:03.293 --> 15:04.729
so either you leave
or I'm gone.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.267
That was a mistake.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.747
No crap!
That was a full beer!

15:22.791 --> 15:24.619
What kind of doctor
is this?

15:25.533 --> 15:26.969
I'm the kind of doctor

15:27.013 --> 15:29.754
who doesn't knock beers
out of people's hands.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.626
You just did.
We all saw it.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.457
When I do knock a beer
out of someone's hand,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.416
that person
deserves an apology.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.550
I'm sorry I knocked the beer
out of your hand.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.507
It's just a beer.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.118
Stay with me here.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.164
The beer results...

15:48.208 --> 15:51.037
They were normal
for normal beer drinkers,

15:51.080 --> 15:53.474
but you're not
a normal beer drinker.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.129
I should have caught it.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.654
ALL: Oh.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.919
I should have apologized
to you,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.877
but I work for
a giant corporation,

16:05.921 --> 16:08.402
and they have strict rules
for this sort of thing.

16:08.445 --> 16:10.099
But I'm not some doctor
who makes a mistake

16:10.143 --> 16:12.188
and doesn't think about it
afterwards.

16:12.232 --> 16:16.149
I'm a doctor who
makes a mistake and
is never the same again,

16:16.192 --> 16:18.673
because the cost
isn't just some patient.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.066
The cost is you.

16:22.851 --> 16:24.200
I'm really sorry
I let you down,

16:24.244 --> 16:26.159
but we've already
implemented a system

16:26.202 --> 16:29.205
to ensure this
will never happen to
you or anyone else.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.729
Thanks for apologizing.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.775
It means a lot to me.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.951
Well, that's why
it's our policy.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.915
Look, I'm just relieved
you're okay.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.004
You know?

16:53.838 --> 16:56.624
Uh, Don, you want Mike
to roll for you?

16:56.667 --> 16:58.060
Tell him "Yes."

17:01.759 --> 17:03.935
Molly. I have Jae's number
for you.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.372
Maybe you can call him
right now.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.027
Oh. Um...
I'll do that later.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.029
Oh.

17:10.072 --> 17:12.857
When you have more privacy
to flirt and giggle?

17:17.297 --> 17:18.907
Oh! Nice jeans, Mom.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.082
Those new?

17:24.478 --> 17:27.437
Look, I'm sorry
I snapped at you
at the school.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.614
Dave should be
in seventh grade.

17:30.658 --> 17:33.139
I had Ken skip a grade
so he was challenged.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.228
And it wasn't good
for him.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.534
He was the smallest kid
in elementary school,

17:37.578 --> 17:39.319
high school, college,

17:39.362 --> 17:41.408
even medical school,
come to think of it.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
But Ken's a doctor.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.500
Yes, he's brilliant
and successful,

17:46.543 --> 17:49.198
but a lot of times,
he felt like an outsider.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.461
I just don't want the
same for Dave.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.898
I was very nervous
for Ken.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.205
He didn't lose his virginity
until med school.

17:56.249 --> 17:57.554
That's younger
than I would have guessed.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.820
But being challenged
is important.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.518
It is.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.390
But you need to trust us
to figure out how to do that.

18:07.434 --> 18:08.696
I'm a great mom,

18:08.739 --> 18:10.698
and Ken is a good dad.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.745
He learned
from one of the best.

18:14.789 --> 18:17.922
Next time, let's just
talk about this stuff first.

18:17.966 --> 18:21.839
I just want to be able
to help around here,
earn my keep.

18:21.883 --> 18:25.104
Don't worry.
We'll find a way to get
the most we can out of you.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.584
Okay.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.719
So what's up with the
hole in the backyard?

18:31.762 --> 18:33.112
Are you planting a tree?

18:33.155 --> 18:34.287
[LAUGHS]

18:35.331 --> 18:36.376
Uh, sure.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.383
Molly, there's a Jae here
to see you...

18:43.426 --> 18:45.515
Korean, bad-boy vibe.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.170

trying to set me up with?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.304
I'll get rid of him.

but our grandfathers
are outside

with a minister
and a deejay.

All right, pal,
move it along.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.202

Why don't you go upstairs?

19:20.246 --> 19:21.290
Okay.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.249
But you're wasting
your time, K-Pop.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.207
She wants to focus
on her studies.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.603
So, other than being Korean
and a boy,

19:30.647 --> 19:32.562
what else are you about?

19:32.606 --> 19:34.869
Well, that's most of it.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.654
But I want to hear
about you.

19:37.698 --> 19:41.092
Uh, your grandfather said
you want to be a doctor?

19:41.136 --> 19:43.007
[LAUGHS]
Yeah. That...

19:51.277 --> 19:52.930
Hey.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.105
Where have you been?

19:54.149 --> 19:55.977
I drove all the way
to Long Beach

19:56.020 --> 19:57.631
to apologize
to that patient.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.025
You made that kind of effort
to apologize to someone?

20:01.069 --> 20:03.332
Spare me the lie
and just tell me you're
having an affair.

20:04.681 --> 20:05.987
So, he's okay?

20:06.030 --> 20:07.597
More than okay.
He bowled a 240.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.514
And the legal department
just e-mailed me.

20:11.558 --> 20:12.472
They already dropped
the lawsuit.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.778
That's amazing!

20:14.822 --> 20:16.258
[LAUGHING] Oh!

20:16.302 --> 20:18.565
I'm really
proud of you.Thanks.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.524
And while I'm on
my apology tour,

20:21.568 --> 20:23.483
I'm sorry I forgot
about Dave's conference.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.528
I don't always
listen to you,

20:25.572 --> 20:27.617
and sometimes that just means
me missing the backstory

20:27.661 --> 20:29.837
as to why you always cry
at car washes, but...

20:31.447 --> 20:33.362
sometimes
there are worse consequences.

20:33.406 --> 20:36.104
Look, I know your
dad's just trying to help
out around here,

20:36.147 --> 20:39.368
and I realize
I could use that to
my advantage.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.718
He's gonna help Dave
build a robot after school.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.024
Your dad
was an engineer,

20:43.067 --> 20:45.156
and it's a good way
to challenge Dave.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.811
See? That was long,
and there were some
really boring parts,

20:47.855 --> 20:49.596
but I listened
to the whole thing.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.686
I really am sorry.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.035
Wow. I'm getting
so good at this.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.645
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.561
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.347
Well, now I guess I can drop
my emotional lawsuit.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.132
Mm. You sure
you want to do that?

21:04.175 --> 21:06.395
Because
you're going to be awarded

21:06.439 --> 21:08.441
some pretty delicious
damages.

21:08.484 --> 21:11.139
[GASPS]
Creamy peanut butter!

21:11.182 --> 21:13.489
[LAUGHS]
It's for my girlfriend,
but she won't mind.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.664
[LAUGHS]

21:15.839 --> 21:17.188
Ohh![LAUGHS]
