Huh?

01:03.250 --> 01:05.580
What is going on?

01:07.960 --> 01:09.880
Star, wake up.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.170
Marco, we're late for school.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.880
- I'm not Marco.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.080
Oh. Oh, no.
The High Commission.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.920
Leave it.
There's no time.

01:28.290 --> 01:30.080
There's no way out.
What are you doing?

01:30.080 --> 01:31.710
Escape route blast!

01:46.420 --> 01:48.710
Magic is not supposed
to do that.

01:48.710 --> 01:50.290
I'm not sure
what that was.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.670
But my magic's gone.

01:53.670 --> 01:55.420
- Rats.
- It will be okay.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.790
No, rats.
We gotta hide.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.670
- Narwhal--
- Star, no.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.290
Mom, you can't take
my wand.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.920
It was mine first.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.380
No more magic until
we find a way to stop this.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.250
I've got an idea.

02:16.250 --> 02:20.040
Let's go destroy
Toffee.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.080
Come on, Mom,
let's just go.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.080
- Let's go kill him.
- Star, no.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.170
Well, then,
what's the plan, Mom?

02:26.170 --> 02:27.920
'Cause I ain't
seein' one.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.750
Oh, Star.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.710
I don't have
a plan.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.170
I'm just trying
to keep you safe, okay?

02:33.170 --> 02:35.960
Okay.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.670
Well, can't stay out here.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.710
It's creepy.

02:40.710 --> 02:42.460
We need
another hiding place.

02:42.460 --> 02:43.830
Ribbit.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.710
Ribbit.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.790
Ribbit.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.920
I think I have an idea
where we can go.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.790
But you have to trust me.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.040
Buffrog!

03:02.040 --> 03:04.750
Star Butterfly!

03:04.750 --> 03:07.170
Oh, my little sweet potato.
It's been too long.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.580
QUEEN MOON: Ahem.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.750
Oh, Queen Moon.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.750
Greetings.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.750
Mom, this is
Yvgeny Bulgoyaboff.

03:15.750 --> 03:18.500
Please, call me
Buffrog.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.750
- He used to work for
Ludo, but he's cool now.
!

03:20.750 --> 03:23.330
Hey, Buffrog, can we
crash with you
for a night?

03:23.330 --> 03:26.290
Of course. I owe you
for all that tadpole-sitting.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.290
Star, can I
speak with you?

03:28.290 --> 03:31.500
We cannot
stay with him.
He's a monster.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.460
Mom, get with the times.
Not all monsters are bad.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.920
Well, it seems we have
no other choice.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.920
Uh, welcome to my...

03:46.920 --> 03:48.880
home.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.750
Boop.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.330
You're in luck.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.120
It's rainy season.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.460
Ah, so good
for the skin.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.330
Oh, uh, no shoes in house.

04:00.330 --> 04:02.880
I am, how you say,
germophobe.

04:02.880 --> 04:08.920
I feel so free.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.170
Buffrog, wonderful home.

04:11.170 --> 04:12.960
Oh, thank you.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.540
Is a bit of a mess
right now.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.380
Please take a seat.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.290
Oh! Are those...

04:18.290 --> 04:20.080
slugs?

04:20.080 --> 04:22.920
Slugs keep
furniture clean.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.920
I thought everyone
knew that.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.080
I'll stand.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.250
Yo, Buffrog,
where them babies at?

04:29.250 --> 04:32.290
Oh, I just put them
down for nap.

04:32.290 --> 04:33.790
Babies!

04:33.790 --> 04:38.580
Oh, I missed
you little baby faces so much.

04:38.580 --> 04:41.500
Oh, my gosh,
you have little baby arms!

04:41.500 --> 04:44.500
Yes, all except
little Katrina.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.540
She is
late bloomer.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.880
Oh, you little special
snowflake.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.880
Babies, say hello to
Queen Butterfly.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.580
That really isn't--

04:55.170 --> 04:58.120
Star, I have been
so worried about you.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.540
Why? I'm good.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.540
Well, when Ludo
took your castle,

05:01.540 --> 05:03.290
I thought, you know...

05:05.120 --> 05:07.750
Whoa, wait.
Toffee has our castle?

05:07.750 --> 05:10.000
Toffee is dead.
Ludo in castle.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.880
Ugh! Toffee not dead.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.790
Toffee inside Ludo.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.420
Oh, I see.
So creepy.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.790
Papa! Dad's still
in the castle!

05:18.790 --> 05:19.920
We have to go save him.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.750
No.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.710
He is your husband!

05:25.710 --> 05:27.620
Star, I've made
my decision.

05:27.620 --> 05:29.000
We stay here.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.170
Excuse me.
Where is your wash room?

05:31.170 --> 05:33.080
Uh, wash room?

05:33.080 --> 05:35.170
Yes. I'd like to
freshen up a bit.

05:35.170 --> 05:36.540
She needs to
make boom-boom.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.880
Oh! The wash room

05:38.880 --> 05:41.380
- is out back.
- Thank you.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.290
I'm sorry.
My mom's got...

05:45.290 --> 05:46.750
monster issues.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.750
Yes, I'm getting
certain vibe from her.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.620
Yeah, we all are.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.920
But Buffrog, I came here
for a favor.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.330
Of course.
Anything for you.

05:57.330 --> 05:58.920
I need you to
hang out with my mom.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.830
I need you to
keep her busy
while I go find Toffee.

06:00.830 --> 06:03.540
Star, Toffee
is very dangerous.

06:03.540 --> 06:05.580
Do you have plan?

06:05.580 --> 06:07.920
- I have plan.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.880
I have plan.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.500
Okay. When Moon returns,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.380
I will distract her.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.960
Distract me
from what?

06:15.960 --> 06:17.880
Uh, from this.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.710
I didn't want you

06:20.710 --> 06:21.920
to see it.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.290
Bad choices in past.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.170
Oh. Thank you.

06:25.170 --> 06:28.580
So what do you monsters
do for entertainment?

06:28.580 --> 06:31.080
Uh, we could smash bugs.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.790
We could play board game.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.880
Great idea, Buffrog.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.250
And I will hang out
with the babies

06:37.250 --> 06:39.460
in their room.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.170
Your daughter
is very strange.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.710
Thank you.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.750
We have many option
of board game.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.120
Monster Conquerors,
Castle Crushers,

06:57.120 --> 07:00.380
Kill the Queen,
Mewman Versus Monster,

07:00.380 --> 07:03.830
or my favorite,
Puddle Defender.

07:03.830 --> 07:05.960
Mmm, interesting.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.960
I like babushka monster.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.920
I don't know why,
but I'm drawn to this one.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.120
Okay, the rules of
Puddle Defender are,

07:14.120 --> 07:15.670
uh...

07:15.670 --> 07:16.960
Um...

07:16.960 --> 07:19.580
the rules are...

07:19.580 --> 07:20.790
Yes?

07:20.790 --> 07:23.120
Uh, rules are simple.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.750
The evil bloodthirsty Mewman,
that's you,

07:25.750 --> 07:29.380
must try and sneak past watchful
Monster parent, that's me.

07:29.380 --> 07:32.920
Break into daycare,
explode helpless monster babies,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.000
and turn them into
stew for eating.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.830
That is horrible!

07:39.120 --> 07:40.830
Hey, here is dice!

07:40.830 --> 07:42.750
You roll first.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.790
QUEEN MOON: Seven.
One, two, three, four,

07:44.790 --> 07:46.920
five, six, seven.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.670
"You are filthy Mewman.

07:48.670 --> 07:51.040
Use teeth-sharpening spell

07:51.040 --> 07:53.880
for better eating of
monster babies." Really?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.170
Is this fun?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.040
Who will get to
daycare first?

07:57.040 --> 07:59.460
Suspense is killing me.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.460
"Congratulations."
Oh.

08:01.460 --> 08:04.040
"You set a Mewman camp
on fire.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.040
Collect four corn pieces
from bank."

08:06.040 --> 08:07.210
Come on.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.250
Oh, you land in
mud puddle.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.170
You get nothing.
Tough break.

08:13.170 --> 08:15.460
This game seems
a tad biased.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.920
Really? I never noticed.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.210
Yay! I get more corn.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.920
Did you hear something?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.120
I hear nothing.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.210
You know, it's monsters
that eat Mewman babies.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.830
Oh, really?

08:31.830 --> 08:34.620
Can you name a time

08:34.620 --> 08:36.830
when monsters have
ever done such a thing?

08:36.830 --> 08:39.790
Well, no, but
when I was a child,

08:39.790 --> 08:42.000
we played a game called
Castle Defender

08:42.000 --> 08:45.750
about Mewmans protecting our
babies from ravenous monsters.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.830
That idea had
to come from somewhere.

08:47.830 --> 08:51.710
Because it was in
a children's board game?

08:51.710 --> 08:53.750
I just think that monsters
would have less of a reputation

08:53.750 --> 08:56.380
if they didn't act
so bloodthirsty all the time.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.120
Monsters only act that way

08:58.120 --> 09:00.380
to protect
their babies from Mewmans.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.170
You may not understand,

09:02.170 --> 09:04.380
but monsters will do
anything for our children.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.040
Don't talk to me about
what I'm willing to do.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.880
Why do you think
I'm here in this swamp?

09:08.880 --> 09:10.880
To protect Star from Toffee!

09:10.880 --> 09:13.580
Don't you think I'm worried to
death about my husband?

09:13.580 --> 09:16.460
But I have to keep my child
safe at all costs!

09:16.460 --> 09:18.670
Something you probably
wouldn't understand,

09:18.670 --> 09:20.920
because you're a monster.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.380
You insult me,
Queen Moon.

09:24.380 --> 09:28.420
My buffbabies,
they are my life.

09:28.420 --> 09:32.580
And that is why,
Star Butterfly...

09:33.960 --> 09:35.420
I will not
help you escape.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.790
- Star!
- Buffrog!

09:36.790 --> 09:38.790
Star will be safe here.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.830
Keeps babies in,
and dangers out.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.500
I should have
realized.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.540
But of course.
You're a parent, too.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.710
I can't believe
you're taking her side.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.960
BOTH: Go to your room!

09:57.420 --> 09:59.670
- Kids.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.920
Scared ol' mama.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.420
Two-timing Buffrog.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.040
What's their plan, huh?

10:05.040 --> 10:06.920
Just avoid your problems
to death.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.670
Great plan.
It's a terrible plan.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.880
I've got plans.
I've got big plans.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.750
But no, they stuck me
in here.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.880
We can help you.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.380
Not now. I'm thinking.
Who said that?

10:17.380 --> 10:18.750
It was me, Katrina.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.960
You guys can talk?!

10:20.960 --> 10:22.710
Just me so far.

10:22.710 --> 10:24.040
I haven't told my dad yet.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.120
There's something else
I haven't told him.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.960
Holy moley!

10:31.960 --> 10:33.710
Sometimes we gotta
sneak out to the club

10:33.710 --> 10:36.250
- and go dancing.
- I feel ya, girl.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.920
All clear.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.210
Wow. We made it.

10:44.790 --> 10:46.920
The plan for
beating Toffee?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.710
Oh, right.

10:49.710 --> 10:50.750
I don't have one.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.540
What?

10:52.540 --> 10:54.120
Yeah, planning's
not really my thing.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.880
I kinda just go for it.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.880
That is a terrible plan.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.830
Oh, my precious
little ribbit babies.

11:00.830 --> 11:01.920
Don't you worry.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.420
I'm very worried.

11:03.420 --> 11:06.170
I'll see you
after I destroy Toffee.

11:10.790 --> 11:12.170
She's gonna die.
