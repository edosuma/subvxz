00:03.500 --> 00:05.220
<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.500
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.580 --> 00:10.300
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

00:10.380 --> 00:12.620
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

00:12.700 --> 00:17.060
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

00:17.140 --> 00:18.620
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

00:18.700 --> 00:20.500
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

00:20.580 --> 00:21.900
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:23.740
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

00:23.820 --> 00:24.940
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

00:25.020 --> 00:27.300
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

00:27.380 --> 00:28.900
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

00:28.980 --> 00:30.340
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

00:30.420 --> 00:32.580
<i>* Together *</i>

00:32.659 --> 00:34.020
<i>* Forever *</i>

00:34.100 --> 00:37.780
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

00:37.860 --> 00:38.980
<i>* Together *</i>

00:39.060 --> 00:40.700
<i>* Forever *</i>

00:40.780 --> 00:41.940
<i>* Together *</i>

00:42.020 --> 00:44.820
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

00:44.900 --> 00:48.500
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

00:51.540 --> 00:55.700
Now I focus on the center
of the ball and...

00:57.980 --> 00:59.060
See? It's simple.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.260
We already did water balls.

01:01.340 --> 01:03.300
Revision never hurt anyone,
Amaris.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.180
You have to practice until
your powers are second nature.

01:07.180 --> 01:10.140
Now, does anyone know
how to shrink it?

01:10.220 --> 01:11.780
How about this?

01:32.020 --> 01:33.660
Principal Santos?

01:33.740 --> 01:36.380
Evie. What can I do for you?

01:37.300 --> 01:39.940
Um...
Oh, don't worry, you look busy.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.060
Oh, no. It's just admin stuff.

01:42.140 --> 01:43.660
It never seems to end.

01:43.740 --> 01:45.220
Do you miss teaching?

01:46.260 --> 01:48.580
You were one of my favorites.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.140
Thank you, Evie.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.540
And now, what do you need?

01:51.620 --> 01:54.740
Good afternoon,
Principal Santos.

01:54.820 --> 01:56.340
Good afternoon, Ms. Trumble.

01:56.420 --> 01:57.820
Evie.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.340
Can I help you?
-No, no.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.700
I was just wondering if you were
looking forward to the weekend?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.420
I always enjoy the weekend.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.979
I was referring to tomorrow's review
of your position as principal.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.500
Of course.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.500
I've been so busy,
it slipped my mind.

02:15.940 --> 02:18.420
I'm surprised you're taking
such a casual approach

02:18.500 --> 02:19.820
to such a serious matter.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.900
I do indeed regard
it as serious.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.580
So do I.

02:24.660 --> 02:28.940
In fact... I'm putting
myself forward for the position.

02:29.780 --> 02:32.020
Evie.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.820
I'm a good teacher.
Yes, you are.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.460
I'm careful. I make sure
they get the basics right.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.620
Yes, you do.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.540
So why are they giving me
such a hard time?

02:43.620 --> 02:46.460
I'm sure you never did that
to your teachers.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.660
Maybe you need to
challenge them.

02:48.740 --> 02:50.700
Be inventive.

02:50.780 --> 02:53.060
Show them something special that
will encourage them to learn.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.460
Like what?

02:55.900 --> 02:59.300
The accelerated growth spell.
- Yes.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.900
I used to love this when I was little.
-I'm sure your class will too.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.260
With a little moon ring magic...

03:05.020 --> 03:06.500
Fijian seaweed becomes...

03:08.700 --> 03:10.460
instant growth accelerator.

03:10.540 --> 03:13.100
Now comes the fun part.

03:13.180 --> 03:16.580
Place a bulb in water,
then we add...

03:16.660 --> 03:17.780
Can I do it?

03:20.780 --> 03:23.140
And now we add
the growth accelerator...

03:23.220 --> 03:24.900
to speed up the
plant's life cycle.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.660
Even Amaris is
going to love this.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.780
That's it. My homework is done.

03:50.860 --> 03:54.140
Now it's just you and me
for the entire evening.

03:54.220 --> 03:56.060
And don't forget the
most important thing.

03:56.140 --> 03:57.220
Mmm-hmm?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.620
Pizza.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.860
Oh, you are such a romantic.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.620
Knock, knock.

04:05.820 --> 04:07.860
Not disturbing you, am I?

04:07.940 --> 04:10.020
No, of course not. Come in.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.700
I got these for you.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.700
Tertiary course guides.

04:19.779 --> 04:22.660
Well, you've got to start thinking
about what you want to study next year.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.740
I can't wait to read them.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.900
Uh, Dr. Blakely...

04:26.980 --> 04:29.540
is Rita gonna be the principal next year?
-Why do you ask?

04:29.620 --> 04:31.220
Well, you're the chairman
of the school board,

04:31.300 --> 04:33.180
and I heard it's
her review tomorrow.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.780
Well, the board is very pleased
with her work.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.060
And between you and me...

04:39.140 --> 04:42.020
all Rita has to do is turn up
and the job is hers.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.340
Mmm.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.140
It's Saturday, Rita.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.580
You're not going to school?

05:00.660 --> 05:02.340
My job review's at 2:30

05:02.420 --> 05:04.380
so I thought I'd go in early
and get some work done.

05:04.460 --> 05:05.980
Would you like some tea?

05:06.060 --> 05:07.980
I've just made some.
-Mmm, thank you.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.700
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for ages.

05:23.780 --> 05:27.260
Nothing like a swim
to the reef to wake you up.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.700
I would have won if you hadn't gone
before I finished counting down.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.460
Did anyone say life was fair?

05:34.100 --> 05:35.140
Oh...

05:35.220 --> 05:38.580
I can't wait to show these little
mermaids they don't know everything.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.740
Where did you put the
growth accelerator?

05:41.820 --> 05:43.620
I thought I put it here.

05:45.700 --> 05:46.860
Oh, here it is.

05:46.940 --> 05:49.060
You want tea?
I'll make some more.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.700
You made tea with this?

05:51.780 --> 05:52.900
Yeah,
I just made a cup for Rita.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.980
Bad tea.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.780
Ah,
you guys look pretty chilled.

06:20.860 --> 06:23.140
We worked hard for it.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.180
Homework done, every
conceivable chore completed.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.700
Nothing to do for the
rest of the day but relax.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.420
I could always use a hand cleaning.
-Sorry, David.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.620
There's a patch of sand on the
beach with our names on it.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.660
Speaking of the beach...

06:36.740 --> 06:37.820
shall we?
-Oh.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.580
Evie, you know that cute little
sundress you showed me yesterday?

06:41.660 --> 06:43.500
I really think I want it.

06:44.660 --> 06:47.580
We were just about to go, Carly.
-Can I try it on?

06:47.660 --> 06:50.700
It'll just take a sec.
Please, please, please?

07:00.380 --> 07:02.260
Not a bad looking old duck,
am I?

07:02.980 --> 07:06.460
How could you do this?
-I didn't know what that stuff was.

07:06.540 --> 07:09.420
The jars look exactly the same.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.940
How am I supposed to know which
one has the real tea in it?

07:12.020 --> 07:13.980
At least we have until Monday
to undo this.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.060
Uh... actually, we don't.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.060
Rita has her job review at 2:30.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.140
That's in three hours.
-Oh, great.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.420
We need a reversal potion.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.380
Mimmi, you can do that.
-No, I can't.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.580
What do you mean you can't?
You know all the potions.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.780
No, I don't.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.020
Uh... I do.

07:35.420 --> 07:38.820
Now, uh... What was it?

07:38.900 --> 07:40.180
Oh, no.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.700
No, that's not it.

07:41.780 --> 07:44.340
Uh... mmm, give me a minute.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.580
Uh...

07:46.860 --> 07:48.940
You should see your faces.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.020
I'm kidding.
I'll tell you what you need.

07:56.060 --> 08:00.300
Sea grass, green algae, red
algae, sea sponges and, uh...

08:00.380 --> 08:02.060
sea slug slime.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:02.140 --> 08:03.420
Is that all we need?

08:04.460 --> 08:06.020
Rita?
-Hmm?

08:07.700 --> 08:08.780
What?

08:08.860 --> 08:12.420
The ingredients for
the reversal potion?

08:13.420 --> 08:17.140
Yes, that's right,
and don't forget the kelp.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.580
We need kelp too?
-Of course we need kelp.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.980
How can you make a
potion without kelp?

08:23.380 --> 08:26.340
We divide up the list, we should be
able to find the stuff in no time.

08:26.420 --> 08:29.740
Mmm.
-Can I not do the sea slug thing?

08:29.820 --> 08:31.300
I have a problem with slime.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.059
Excuse me?

08:34.140 --> 08:36.220
Could someone get
me a glass of water?

08:36.299 --> 08:39.059
I... I don't fancy
those stairs on my own.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.419
Maybe I should
stay and watch her.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.780
Good luck with that.

08:52.060 --> 08:54.060
Can I get you anything else?

08:54.140 --> 08:55.660
A blanket would be nice.

08:56.700 --> 09:00.540
And may I say
what a lovely grotto you have.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.180
Um...

09:02.260 --> 09:05.700
actually, it's your...
-Got you again.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.140
You're early, Ms. Trumble.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.300
Your interview isn't until 3:30.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.020
I'm quite aware, Dr. Blakely.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.780
I left home early in case of
motor accidents on the highway.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.100
This interview is
very important to me.

09:33.180 --> 09:35.460
Your commitment is commendable,
Ms. Trumble.

09:42.380 --> 09:44.300
Happy?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.380
Might be time for
an ice cream though.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.700
Does your stomach
ever take a break?

09:51.780 --> 09:54.660
Hi, guys.
Carly told me you'd be here.

09:54.740 --> 09:58.580
Now that I've left the café business,
I'm thinking about going into a new one...

09:58.660 --> 10:01.460
a juice bar,
actually on the beach.

10:01.540 --> 10:04.180
Cam...
- I know, it's a great idea.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.580
I've come up with
a list of names...

10:06.660 --> 10:09.260
...see which one you
guys like the best.

10:09.340 --> 10:13.260
Juiced, Juicerama, Surf Juice.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.660
Not doing it for you?
I've got more.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.980
"Juice Junction, Juice-em-up."

10:21.060 --> 10:23.540
What about...
"Every Which Way But Juice"?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.140
Where are you going?

10:34.220 --> 10:36.460
I'd like to sit in the sun.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.420
Well, I don't think that's
a good idea in your, um...

10:40.500 --> 10:41.540
condition.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.140
Really?

10:43.220 --> 10:46.140
But I thought it might help me
remember the final ingredient

10:46.220 --> 10:48.300
for the reversal potion.

10:48.380 --> 10:50.060
There's a final ingredient?

10:50.140 --> 10:52.100
Oh, I don't know, dear.
Is there?

10:53.380 --> 10:56.380
Let's talk about it outside,
in the sun.

11:19.860 --> 11:21.660
<i>Isn't it amazing?</i>

11:22.420 --> 11:25.700
Two worlds so close together,
but...

11:25.780 --> 11:27.540
so different.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.020
It's amazing.

11:30.980 --> 11:33.900
Now,
about that final ingredient.

11:33.980 --> 11:39.580
I thought if I could live here
and learn about land people...

11:39.660 --> 11:42.140
I might help us
understand each other.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.740
But you never went
back to the sea.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.820
Oh, I thought about it...

11:47.900 --> 11:50.500
but I enjoyed what I
was doing here and...

11:50.580 --> 11:52.780
Well, the years went by...

11:53.980 --> 11:55.620
so quickly.

11:55.700 --> 11:58.140
Do you regret not going back?

11:59.460 --> 12:00.660
No.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.420
No, it's been a fulfilling life.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.020
And I might never have met you.

12:17.260 --> 12:19.180
It appears Principal Santos
has been delayed.

12:20.380 --> 12:22.300
We'll see you now, Ms. Trumble.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.700
We got everything.
-Well, not quite.

12:36.780 --> 12:38.300
There's another ingredient.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.180
Rita's been holding out on us.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.340
Naughty Rita...

12:44.020 --> 12:45.740
Where did she...

12:46.780 --> 12:49.380
I just wanted to see
if I could still do that.

12:50.260 --> 12:51.540
Stop fooling around, Rita.

12:52.180 --> 12:55.060
We need to reverse this so we
can get you to the interview.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.020
We're too late. It's 2:30.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.860
We need to buy some time.

12:59.940 --> 13:00.980
Where's Rita's phone?

13:01.060 --> 13:02.980
I'll text Dr. Blakely.

13:03.060 --> 13:07.100
I know I have a reputation
for being tough.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.460
The students'
nickname for me is Ms. Trouble,

13:10.540 --> 13:11.820
but I'm tough

13:11.900 --> 13:14.180
because I care about
these young people.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.500
A good education is their
path to a bright future.

13:18.580 --> 13:23.540
Like seeds, they need
nutritious soil to germinate.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.380
What's the final ingredient?

13:25.460 --> 13:26.940
You girls look so serious.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.580
This is serious, Rita.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.820
If you don't get to the review,
you could lose your job.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.020
Oh.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.500
Oh, all right.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.940
Uh, to complete the potion you
need to add three drops of...

13:41.900 --> 13:43.140
Three drops of what?

13:43.220 --> 13:44.500
Oh, dear.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.340
I can't seem to remember.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.100
Stop kidding around, Rita.

13:49.180 --> 13:50.740
But I'm not kidding.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.060
I really can't remember.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.620
Strawberry and
chocolate for you.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.260
Banana and licorice for me.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.300
Banana and licorice?
-Hey, don't knock it until you try it.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.060
Uh, thanks, but I want to
stay friends with my stomach.

14:14.060 --> 14:17.580
Green algae.
-Are you sure? It's very green already.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.140
They're not going to wait much
longer. We better move it.

14:24.220 --> 14:26.420
Rita, the final ingredient?
Think.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.180
Don't yell at me.

14:29.260 --> 14:30.940
Now what was it?

14:33.300 --> 14:34.820
Oh, it's no use.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.980
Call Zac.
-Okay.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.580
I knew it couldn't last.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.380
Hey, Weilan.

14:51.460 --> 14:53.020
What?

14:55.140 --> 14:56.180
Now?

15:00.060 --> 15:03.220
During her time
as Principal of Suncoast High,

15:03.300 --> 15:06.820
Principal Santos has done a
wonderful job running the school.

15:07.620 --> 15:11.340
But I believe it's
time for change.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.660
Dad?

15:14.740 --> 15:17.140
Zac? What are you doing?

15:17.220 --> 15:20.180
Uh, I need to speak to you.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.660
I'm in the middle
of an interview.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.580
It's really important.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.060
Please.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.820
This better be important.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.820
I was looking through
the booklets you gave me.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.140
Yes?
-Very informative, weren't they, Evie?

15:39.220 --> 15:40.460
Very.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.540
In fact, there are a couple
of courses I'm interested in.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.540
That's very nice. Now,
why did you get me out here?

15:46.620 --> 15:48.660
After reading the guides
and talking to Evie,

15:48.740 --> 15:50.420
we discussed it a lot,
didn't we?

15:50.500 --> 15:53.540
We canvassed a lot of
possibilities, Dr. Blakely.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.500
Looked at all the options...

15:55.580 --> 15:56.860
Would you please get on with it?

15:56.940 --> 15:58.500
I want to be a doctor, like you.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.020
That's very flattering, Zac,

16:00.100 --> 16:02.340
but you could have waited
to tell me till I got home.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.140
You said I should make a decision,
and I wanted to let you know.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.460
We'll discuss this later.

16:07.540 --> 16:08.900
Dad?

16:13.260 --> 16:14.500
Now what?

16:16.220 --> 16:18.740
Rita, I don't mean
to hassle you, but...

16:19.900 --> 16:21.980
Seaweed extract!

16:22.060 --> 16:24.220
Oh, that's what it is.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.900
Mmm.

16:25.980 --> 16:30.180
Is it the tufted seaweed
or the broadleaf seaweed?

16:30.260 --> 16:32.100
Oh, I can't remember.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.980
How do we decide?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.620
Well,
Rita said it's one of them,

16:36.700 --> 16:38.500
so we have an even chance
of getting it right.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.660
Or getting it wrong.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.900
I say pick one and go for it.

16:44.740 --> 16:46.700
For goodness sake.

16:50.580 --> 16:53.500
As I see it,
the principal of a school

16:53.580 --> 16:55.780
is like the captain of a ship...

16:55.860 --> 16:58.140
steering her staff and students

16:58.220 --> 17:00.140
across a vast ocean...

17:00.980 --> 17:05.619
through the peaks and troughs
of the academic year.

17:14.740 --> 17:17.220
We'll give you a moment,
Ms. Trumble.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.020
That won't be necessary,
Dr. Blakely.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.300
With my strong hand at the helm,

17:22.380 --> 17:27.940
I am confident that
I can steer the proud ship,

17:28.020 --> 17:30.100
named Suncoast High,

17:30.180 --> 17:32.500
safely to harbor.

17:34.260 --> 17:39.260
Thank you, Ms. Trumble, for a
most interesting presentation.

17:39.340 --> 17:41.580
You'll have our
decision by Monday.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.460
Rita?

18:13.140 --> 18:14.780
It's ready.

18:18.020 --> 18:21.700
If this works, there's still a
chance for you to make the interview.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.820
Dr. Blakely!

18:53.900 --> 18:56.700
Principal Santos? What happened?

18:56.780 --> 19:01.300
I'm so very sorry.
I had... an unexpected holdup.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.900
The board members
are still here.

19:02.980 --> 19:04.700
I'm sure they'd be happy
to conduct your review.

19:04.780 --> 19:06.260
Come on, we'd better hurry.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.620
Principal Santos?

19:13.900 --> 19:14.980
What's wrong?

19:21.580 --> 19:24.180
You know the hardest thing
about being old?

19:25.260 --> 19:29.100
It's looking back and seeing
how far away some things are.

19:34.020 --> 19:36.020
I'm going to miss Suncoast High.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.860
Maybe Ms. Trumble
won't be as bad as we think.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.100
Are you kidding?

19:54.180 --> 19:55.620
She'll be worse.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.780
How could Rita quit on us?

19:58.860 --> 20:01.140
I don't think you
should see it like that.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.380
And I think I know why.

20:07.220 --> 20:08.700
Enlighten us, please.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.580
There's nothing harder than
being caught between two worlds.

20:13.660 --> 20:16.500
Eventually...
one of them has to win.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.420
You really giving it up?

20:42.860 --> 20:45.820
Today, when I was
looking out at the ocean,

20:45.900 --> 20:48.380
I felt something I haven't felt
in a long time.

20:49.460 --> 20:53.100
I love teaching, but...
I miss the sea.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.260
What are you going to do?

20:56.460 --> 20:58.220
I don't know.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.020
But right now...

21:01.580 --> 21:03.060
I need a swim.

21:21.260 --> 21:22.540
Ondina?

21:23.820 --> 21:25.620
You wanted to speak to me?

21:25.700 --> 21:26.820
Not exactly.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.380
Veridia?

21:32.460 --> 21:33.900
Rita.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.740
I have a problem.

21:35.820 --> 21:39.500
Ondina feels that she has taken
her students as far as she can.

21:39.580 --> 21:43.420
She feels that what they require now is
a teacher who can truly inspire them.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.620
You wouldn't happen to know
someone like that, would you?

21:47.700 --> 21:50.460
Someone who can unlock
our young mermaids' potential.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.780
I might know someone.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.780
That was a great thing you did,
giving your job to Rita.

22:03.860 --> 22:06.180
No big deal.
Rita was born to teach.

22:06.260 --> 22:08.980
I bet you won't be missing
those little mermaids.

22:09.060 --> 22:10.700
Actually, I will.

22:17.820 --> 22:19.420
It's simple.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.620
The ball must be formed
perfectly in your mind...

22:24.700 --> 22:26.940
and then it will be
perfect in reality.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.700
We've done this before.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.180
It's so old.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.380
That's true, Amaris...

22:35.140 --> 22:38.420
but what you might not realize
is that with just a simple twist

22:38.500 --> 22:41.100
what was old can
become something...

22:43.740 --> 22:45.100
magical.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.780
Wow!

22:49.580 --> 22:52.140
Whoa!
-Amazing!

22:56.740 --> 22:58.300
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:58.380 --> 22:59.860
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:59.940 --> 23:03.260
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:03.340 --> 23:05.180
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

23:05.260 --> 23:10.340
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:10.420 --> 23:11.820
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:11.900 --> 23:13.380
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:13.460 --> 23:14.740
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:14.820 --> 23:17.020
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:17.100 --> 23:18.220
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:18.300 --> 23:20.180
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:20.260 --> 23:21.500
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:21.580 --> 23:23.940
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:24.020 --> 23:25.580
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:25.660 --> 23:28.300
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:28.380 --> 23:30.660
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:30.740 --> 23:32.340
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:32.420 --> 23:34.940
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:35.020 --> 23:36.580
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

23:36.660 --> 23:38.220
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:38.300 --> 23:39.820
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:39.900 --> 23:41.420
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:41.500 --> 23:43.660
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:43.740 --> 23:44.900
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:44.980 --> 23:46.540
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:46.620 --> 23:48.020
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:48.100 --> 23:50.340
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:50.420 --> 23:51.740
<i>* Together *</i>

23:51.820 --> 23:53.620
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:53.700 --> 23:56.900
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

23:56.980 --> 23:58.580
<i>* Together *</i>

23:58.660 --> 24:00.220
<i>* Forever *</i>

24:00.300 --> 24:01.420
<i>* Together *</i>

24:01.500 --> 24:04.900
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

24:06.580 --> 24:09.220
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>
