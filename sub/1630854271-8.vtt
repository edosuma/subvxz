WEBVTT

00:04.754 --> 00:07.465
* Well, if they freed me
from this prison *

00:07.507 --> 00:09.467
* If that old railroad train
was mine *

00:09.509 --> 00:11.720
Tanner has a tendency
to go into the growl,

00:11.761 --> 00:14.347
where Austin keeps his tone
a little cleaner.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.349
* Well, far from
Folsom Prison *

00:16.391 --> 00:18.435
Blake, who's the winner
of this battle?

00:18.476 --> 00:21.438
There's two ways to go here,
and they're both right.

00:21.479 --> 00:28.194
**

00:28.236 --> 00:30.363
Uh, the winner of this battle
is Austin.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.491
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:33.533 --> 00:34.617
Thataboy.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.828
Austin and Tanner
did an incredible job.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.372
At the end of the day,
I just feel like Austin

00:39.414 --> 00:41.958
is in touch
with that classic country sound,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.461
and I think it's important
for this show to have an artist

00:44.502 --> 00:47.422
that represents not only country
music but that time period.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.050
Coach, let me remind you that
Tanner's available to save.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.551
Tanner, anything
you want to say to Coach?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.345
I just want to say
I really appreciate y'all

00:53.386 --> 00:55.305
putting faith in me
and letting me come out here.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.307
I'm very thankful.
I'm just happy to be here.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.768
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Tanner Fussell

00:59.809 --> 01:01.144
one more time!
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:01.186 --> 01:02.687
So good!

01:02.729 --> 01:05.065
Blake: We have these
three-way knockouts coming.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.816
It just makes it
that much more important

01:06.858 --> 01:09.402
to build the best team
that you possibly can.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.321
And sadly, that also means
there's going to be

01:11.363 --> 01:14.366
a flood of really talented
people going home.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.202
Man: <i>Okay. Good to go.</i>
<i>One minute out.</i>

01:17.243 --> 01:18.370
Ah-ah-ah.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.121
Bom-bom-bom-bom.
Bom-bom-bom-bom.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.581
Blake: Oh, Gwen,
you got a tough one.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.750
Oh, my gosh.
Ugh! I know!

01:23.792 --> 01:24.959
This one's so hard.

01:25.001 --> 01:26.753
They're little.
He even drew his flowers.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.463
They're little puppy dogs.
Yeah.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.632
There's nothing different about
today than the rehearsals.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.425
Just that other people
are here.
True.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.552
That's it. Just do you.
Alright. Have some fun.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.887
I will.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.431
* Unh, alright, do it *

01:38.473 --> 01:40.433
Hi. Sean! Yes!
Hey. What's up?

01:40.475 --> 01:43.561
As my adviser this season,
I have Sean Paul.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.272
It's just amazing
to be able to work with him

01:46.314 --> 01:47.774
because he's collaborated

01:47.816 --> 01:51.152
with huge artists
like BeyoncÃ©, Rihanna.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.779
<i>Salud, salud.</i>
This is so crazy

01:52.821 --> 01:55.115
'cause we just have a song
together that just came out.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.952
* Baby, won't you
light my fire? *

01:58.993 --> 02:00.286
* Bidi-bang, bang, bang *

02:00.328 --> 02:02.205
* Lemme tell ya,
what a piece of hotness *

02:02.247 --> 02:03.623
* When da fire touch skin *
Hey!

02:03.665 --> 02:06.751
* When da neighbors get vex
and get up and knockin' *

02:06.793 --> 02:09.796
Gwen: He writes music that gets
the whole party going

02:09.838 --> 02:12.173
and gets people in trouble,
really.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.592
* Won't you
light my fire? *

02:14.634 --> 02:16.302
* I got you, I got you *

02:16.344 --> 02:18.638
Sean: When Gwen asked me
to be an adviser,

02:18.680 --> 02:20.682
I thought it was
a perfect opportunity for me

02:20.724 --> 02:24.811
to impart some of the knowledge
I've learned over the years.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.312
[ Cheers and applause ]

02:26.354 --> 02:28.857
Gwen: Yes!
That was unexpected.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.485
"The Voice" is definitely
about more raw talent for me.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.696
It's one of the reasons
I like this show.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.823
This is two
of my teammates.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.908
Jillian was the one
that came out,

02:38.950 --> 02:42.245
and she had, like, the craziest
opening lines to the song.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.663
And you were like, "Bang!"

02:43.705 --> 02:45.290
Immediately I was like,
"This girl's for me."

02:45.331 --> 02:47.334
* When I'm down,
I get real down *

02:47.375 --> 02:48.418
* When I'm high,
I don't come down *

02:48.460 --> 02:49.919
Just a few months ago,

02:49.961 --> 02:52.464
I was sitting on my couch
at home watching "The Voice"

02:52.505 --> 02:55.175
with my family,
and now I'm here.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.259
That's crazy.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.054
You're a really good
singer.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.638
I'm so very grateful.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.681
Aah!

03:01.723 --> 03:03.683
My family is very supportive.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.769
They will do anything
for me to succeed.

03:05.810 --> 03:10.273
Got a stepmom, a stepdad,
three new stepsisters,

03:10.315 --> 03:13.360
a stepbrother,
and a biological sister.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.570
One big happy family. I love it.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.031
I pressed my button 'cause
I loved her voice so much.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.366
She's really young.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.284
So today will be, like,
really telling.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.911
And then Rowan
was spectacular.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.372
I really feel like she's
something really special.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.040
She has that star thing.
Mm-hmm.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.709
* You betrayed me *

03:29.751 --> 03:31.378
* 'Cause I know that you... *

03:31.419 --> 03:32.837
Ever since the age of 13,

03:32.879 --> 03:34.631
I've been interested
in coming on "The Voice,"

03:34.673 --> 03:36.424
but I never thought
it would, like, actually happen.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.968
At 16 years old,
to channel that emotion,

03:39.010 --> 03:40.387
I need to work with you.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.722
My grandma has been
a huge inspiration for me.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.850
She introduced me
to older '60s bands,

03:45.892 --> 03:47.727
and she would play
around the house all the time.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.896
That's how it started,
and then I did theater.

03:49.938 --> 03:54.275
It's really where I found
my love for being on stage.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.569
So to finally be here
at the Battles

03:56.611 --> 03:59.280
is beyond what I imagined,

03:59.322 --> 04:02.158
and it's very awesome,
very awesome.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.744
There they are.
Look how cute.
Oh, my God.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.704
Oh, my gosh!

04:05.745 --> 04:07.414
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.665
Hi!
Hi!

04:08.707 --> 04:09.749
Oh, my gosh! Sean Paul!
Sean Paul!

04:09.791 --> 04:11.501
Jillian:
Sean Paul is a huge star.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.088
He knows how to get you hyped,
excited, in the zone.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.591
His amount of hits and joy
that he's brought to people

04:18.633 --> 04:20.427
around the world
and parties.
Oh, yeah. 100%.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.720
He's gonna be
really helpful

04:21.761 --> 04:23.847
with you to get
the audience engaged.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.683
I'm just, like, in the presence
of a musical genius

04:26.725 --> 04:29.811
right now, and I'm like, "Aah!"

04:29.853 --> 04:31.730
I'm just here,
like, as a mama...
Yeah.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.524
...to help you guys download
whatever I've learned.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.401
He's gonna download
whatever he knows.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.736
I'm the uncle.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.154
Yes. The uncle.
I love it.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.947
I'm, like,
such a huge fan.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.116
Honestly a dream
come true for me, too,

04:43.158 --> 04:44.784
and I'm so glad
to be here.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.161
I'm so grateful
that you're here.
This is crazy.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.620
This is unreal.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.289
Gwen: What did you think
when you guys were paired?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.290
So excited.
We were so excited.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.541
Oh, my God.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.084
We're best friends.
Oh, you are?!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.377
Yes.
Yeah.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.255
* Introduced me
to your family *

04:57.297 --> 05:00.884
I gave them "Fingers Crossed"
by Lauren Spencer-Smith.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.596
This is a contemporary song.
Perfect lyrics for young girls.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.766
* Making plans to travel
around the world *

05:07.807 --> 05:13.146
Rowan, she's so young but
can access her heart so easily.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.647
* Now, I *

05:14.689 --> 05:17.400
She can take lyrics
that she didn't write

05:17.442 --> 05:19.652
and make you believe
that she wrote them.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.029
She's very gifted.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.824
* I want all the tears back
that I cried *

05:24.866 --> 05:27.660
Jillian had a lot of emotion
when she sings.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.997
She had a lot of confidence.
She had a lot of personality.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.916
She really blew me away.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.419
Together:
* Cr-o-o-o-ossed *

05:36.461 --> 05:37.671
That sounds so pretty,
you guys.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.922
That was awesome.
Both: Thank you.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.423
You can tell you guys
are friends.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.300
There's definitely love
in the room.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.010
There definitely is.
So much love.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.179
Especially when you guys looked
at each other at the end there.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.348
So keep that up.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.392
When you're doing
your fancy stuff,

05:50.433 --> 05:52.602
which is
incredibly amazing,

05:52.644 --> 05:54.354
where it says, "You must have
your fingers crossed,"

05:54.396 --> 05:57.148
she almost is saying it like
it's such a backhanded thing.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.525
Yeah.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.859
So if you put, like,
a fancy thing on it,

05:59.901 --> 06:01.528
it takes away
from the emotion.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.196
Loses its purpose
a little bit.
You know?

06:03.238 --> 06:04.447
Right.
Jillian, you're starting

06:04.489 --> 06:06.032
to get a little nasally
and tight.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.826
I think that you
could be warmer.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.537
Open your voice up
a little bit more, round it out.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.288
Also, we need to work more
on your body language.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.833
Definitely.
You need to get off
that mike stand

06:14.874 --> 06:16.543
and start to get your body
to connect to the song

06:16.584 --> 06:18.044
a little bit more.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.963
Usually for me on stage,
if I'm having a bad day

06:20.005 --> 06:22.590
touring or whatever,
I look at the crowd,

06:22.632 --> 06:24.634
and there's people
who got smiles in their face

06:24.676 --> 06:27.220
because of the lyrics
I'm saying,

06:27.262 --> 06:31.766
and that automatically transfers
to my giving it back to them.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.728
So bring us into,
like, your world.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.105
This is such
a visual song,

06:37.147 --> 06:40.692
and if you don't do it right
with your facial expressions,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.402
you're missing
a really good opportunity.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.987
Yeah,
Like, you're not
going to say...

06:44.029 --> 06:47.490
* Introduce me to your family *
with your eyes shut.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.783
You're going to say --

06:48.825 --> 06:50.910
* Introduce me
to your family *

06:50.952 --> 06:52.579
You're desperate.
Yeah.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.539
And she's recalling it,
and she's telling you,

06:54.581 --> 06:56.583
"This is what I thought
was real,"

06:56.624 --> 06:58.752
later to find out,
at the end,

06:58.793 --> 07:00.920
you're going to say --
* Now I hate you *

07:00.962 --> 07:03.173
And it's gonna be jarring
for the audience

07:03.214 --> 07:05.216
'cause they're going to say,
"She just said she hated him."

07:05.258 --> 07:08.928
Getting into the character,
living that moment is very key.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.222
With No Doubt,
we would film every show

07:11.264 --> 07:12.599
and then we'd watch it back.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.768
And that's where you can
really see the truth.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.603
Yes. Definitely.
So if you want
to send me videos

07:16.644 --> 07:18.188
of, like, let's say you guys
are in your room

07:18.229 --> 07:19.814
and you just want to film
each other and send it to me,

07:19.856 --> 07:21.608
I'd love to see
what you're doing.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.942
Yeah.
Thank you.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.402
Jillian and I,
we're really good friends.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.779
* Remember when... *

07:25.820 --> 07:27.530
It's been helpful
when we're working together,

07:27.572 --> 07:29.074
but in the end,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.784
I definitely don't want
to be going home.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.994
This season, there will be
one steal and one save.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.622
There could be a situation
where both of us move on,

07:35.663 --> 07:37.624
and that's the situation
we both want.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.710
And if we work together to make
it, like, go well together.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.087
You have to visualize that.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.838
You have to feel it
in your heart,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.215
which I'm feeling right now.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.633
Gwen has a tough job.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.884
What am I gonna do?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.427
I don't know.
You're in trouble, Gwen.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.554
I know.
[ Laughter ]

07:57.352 --> 07:58.520
* This is "The Voice" *

07:58.561 --> 07:59.854
Daly:
Welcome back to the Battles

it's very emotive.
Thank you.

You guys are both
such great singers.

that I made a good decision."

you're really good.

Your tone
is so interesting.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.034

hitting were just stunning.

and you do a good job

sometimes it can derail people.

your record someday,

you're gonna sell
at least one copy -- to me.

on the Battle.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.247
Jillian, I felt like
at the beginning

12:27.288 --> 12:29.124
I could hear the nerves
in your voice.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.251
It's hard to come in soft
like that,

12:31.292 --> 12:33.044
especially
your style of singing.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.754
But you did great,
and you recovered

12:34.796 --> 12:36.756
and got better and better
through the performance.
Oh, yeah.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.384
You really did prove to me
how talented you are.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.886

it's pretty mind-blowing.

in the right moments,

the great Jazmine Sullivan.

Just love her authenticity.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.132

for themselves.

gonna happen for me.

that big moment is gonna be.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.756
Valarie: Jazmine has a career
that I would love to emulate.

17:27.797 --> 17:31.551
And with me being 41 years old,
it's never too late.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.136
Yay!

17:33.178 --> 17:35.388
I do have two
beautiful grandbabies --

17:35.430 --> 17:37.974
six-month-old grandbaby
and a two-month-old.

17:38.016 --> 17:41.811
Figured I'm a young grandmother,
you know. [ Laughs ]

17:41.853 --> 17:44.481
I want to be able
to let them see something

17:44.522 --> 17:47.150
that their grandmother did
later on in life.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.651
Pretty girl. Mwah.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.946
* I've given him,
I've given him *

17:51.988 --> 17:53.782
My Blind Audition day,

17:53.823 --> 17:56.451
it was a breath of fresh air
'cause I love to sing.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.453
John: You have such great energy
coming from you,

17:58.495 --> 18:00.705
and I would <i>love</i>
to have you on the team.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.417
I want to keep pushing
to show John that I can do it.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.044
So help them
get in the mood.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.046
Talk about how
you wrote this song.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.506
I really did it.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.466
I bust the windows
out of an ex-boyfriend's car.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.052
And then, like, that morning,
I wrote the song.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.136
Wow.
Wow.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.138
So don't cross Jazmine.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.015
If you like your car.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.266
[ Laughter ]

18:20.308 --> 18:22.519
Well, that's the truth.
Ah!

18:22.560 --> 18:26.773
* I bust the windows
out your car *

18:26.815 --> 18:30.193
* And, no, it didn't mend
my broken heart *

18:30.235 --> 18:34.364
The fact that I had to
sing her song in front of her...

18:34.406 --> 18:36.825
[ Chuckles ]

18:36.866 --> 18:38.451
Almost lost my mind.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.704
I'm very excited just to
be able to do her proud.

18:40.745 --> 18:44.374
* You can't just play
with people's feelings *

18:44.416 --> 18:46.876
Jazmine:
Dia had a beautiful voice.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.336
I wasn't expecting for her

18:48.378 --> 18:50.588
to have, like, a growl
at some points.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.716
And I feel like maybe
with me being there,

18:52.757 --> 18:54.884
it kind of made her
go a little harder.

18:54.926 --> 18:58.763
* I bust the windows
out your car *

18:58.805 --> 19:01.099
Valarie, she had,
like, her own flow.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.102
She, like, changed up
the rhythm sometimes.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.645
And I was all for it.

19:05.687 --> 19:06.896
Alright.
Whew, whew!

19:06.938 --> 19:08.732
Jazmine: It's a fun song.
It's just about

19:08.773 --> 19:10.400
getting the character right,
and then people feel that.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.694
Character.
So important.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.572
Dia, I feel like you could
give me a little more of that --

19:15.613 --> 19:17.741
If you think of, like,
Catwoman, just like...

19:17.782 --> 19:18.742
Ooh.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.369
* Didn't mend
my broken heart *

19:21.411 --> 19:22.662
Ooh, I like that.
Okay, okay.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.539
Righteous indignation.
Mm-hmm.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.708
He really done messed up.
He deserves this.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.876
That's right.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.419
And come off the note
a little quicker.

19:29.461 --> 19:30.754
Your notes are beautiful,

19:30.795 --> 19:32.881
but I think if you
cut them off some more,

19:32.922 --> 19:35.050
then it'll sound more
in the attitude of the song.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.135
I think it should be
a little less pretty.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.595
Okay.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.264
I want to be able to apply
the most organic emotion

19:41.306 --> 19:43.350
that I possibly can.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.893
I want to prove to John

19:44.934 --> 19:47.479
that there's a reason
why he turned around for me.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.397
* Real love *

19:49.439 --> 19:51.524
* I'm searching
for a real love *

19:51.566 --> 19:54.069
I love your energy,
your confidence.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.112
She's a star.
Thank you.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.782
Dia: Recently, since I moved
to North Carolina,

19:58.823 --> 20:01.701
I have my own in-house
recording studio.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.913
Kind of helps me to be able
to just formulate my own sound.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.791
I definitely feel like
this is my time to really

20:07.832 --> 20:11.294
show people a side to me
that they've never seen before.

20:11.336 --> 20:14.547
Valarie, I don't think you need
to do the background melody.

20:14.589 --> 20:16.883
* Dum-dum-dum,
da-bum, bum-bum-bah-nah *

20:16.925 --> 20:19.010
Do, like your own, like,
lead kind of version.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.387
* You broke my heart *

20:20.428 --> 20:21.805
Yeah.
Okay.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.264
[ Vocalizing ]

20:23.306 --> 20:24.933
Because you're not a background
singer. You're the lead.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.895
* And I bust the windows
out your car, yeah *

20:28.937 --> 20:30.438
Valarie:
Performing this song together,

20:30.480 --> 20:32.649
it's definitely
gonna be a battle.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.360
So I know I got to give more
and push more

20:35.402 --> 20:37.153
because she's in it to win it.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.697
I can't stop smiling.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.281
Me either. Honestly,
my cheekbones are like --

20:40.323 --> 20:42.158
Y'all killed the song!

20:42.200 --> 20:45.036
And you hear vocalists
interpret it their way,
and they kill it.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.579
Like, you made me feel it,
and I wrote it, so...

20:46.621 --> 20:47.997
Wow.
Aww.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.333
Thank you, Jazmine.
This is gonna be tough.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.502
John: Both of these ladies
are singing

20:52.544 --> 20:54.504
with their full energy

20:54.546 --> 20:56.006
and they're coming
with different tones,

20:56.047 --> 20:59.426
different styles,
but doing it really beautifully.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.559
* This is "The Voice" *

Welcome back to the Battles.

21:09.728 --> 21:14.149
Dia! Look at this outfit!

21:14.190 --> 21:15.608
Dia: In this moment,

21:15.650 --> 21:17.736
time to really show people
what's really inside,

21:17.777 --> 21:20.572
what I really
came here to do.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.407
Yes, Valarie!

21:22.449 --> 21:24.743
Valarie: Coming in here
at 41 years old,

21:24.784 --> 21:27.162
I'm gonna show my kids
and my grandchildren

21:27.203 --> 21:30.498
keep pushing, you'll be able
to make it to wherever it is

21:30.540 --> 21:31.916
that you want to be in life.

out your car *

have these ugly scars *

it helped a little bit *

* To think of how you'd feel
when you saw it *

22:29.099 --> 22:33.269
* I didn't know I had
that much strength *

22:33.311 --> 22:36.690
* But I'm glad you'll see
what happens when *

22:36.731 --> 22:41.986
* You see you can't
play with people's feelings *

22:42.028 --> 22:45.865
* Tell them you love them
and don't mean it *

22:45.907 --> 22:50.662

that it was juvenile *

I deserve to smile-ile *

22:54.374 --> 22:56.209

* Even though what you did
to me was much worse *

23:24.654 --> 23:26.406
* I had to do something *

23:26.448 --> 23:31.786
* So I bust the windows
out your car, yeah *

23:31.828 --> 23:35.915
* You know I did it
'cause I left my mark *

23:35.957 --> 23:40.628
* Wrote my initials
with a crow bar *

23:40.670 --> 23:44.007

into the dark *

out your car *

of this bull *

24:14.871 --> 24:17.082
Whoo!
Got 'em hyped in here!

24:17.123 --> 24:18.875
You almost wore
that outfit today.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.251
I did. I did wear it.

24:20.293 --> 24:22.087
And I changed it when I saw
what she had on.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.464
You two scared me a little bit
up there singing.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.757
That was like, "Wow."

24:25.799 --> 24:27.384
They'll bust the windows
out your car.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.928
I hope I never get -- cross ways
with either one of these two.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.347
You know, Dia, for me,
I think you had

24:32.389 --> 24:35.058
the overall more consistent
performance.

24:35.100 --> 24:39.020
But Valarie has this
explosive thing about her voice

24:39.062 --> 24:41.981
and it's so exciting
and it's just so much fun.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.858
Okay.
Camila:
I didn't know that song.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.152
That song is really sick.
That was a great choice.

24:46.194 --> 24:50.031
Jazmine Sullivan.
My adviser this season.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.742
It was sassy.
It was explosive.

24:52.784 --> 24:57.414
Valarie, technically, you have
more of a mastery of your voice.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.290
Your runs were so clean.

24:59.332 --> 25:03.920
And, Dia, your face
and your movement was conveying,

25:03.962 --> 25:05.755
I feel like,
the emotion of the song.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.632
Like, you're exciting to watch.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.384
I would probably pick Dia.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.885
[ Applause ]

25:10.927 --> 25:14.139
I think vocally you guys
are both equally as talented,

25:14.180 --> 25:17.142
but at the same time, Valarie,
you really know your voice.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.519
Like, it's very comfortable
for you.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.479
We really know who you are
as a singer.

25:21.521 --> 25:26.067
The problem was that when Dia
came out, she had this attitude

25:26.109 --> 25:28.194
and she was looking
at the audience like,

25:28.236 --> 25:31.698
"I'm about ready
to show you who I am."

25:31.740 --> 25:33.992
You're a really budding,
like, entertainer.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.494
I would say that Dia
kind of stole my heart

25:36.536 --> 25:37.912
in this performance.
John: Hm.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.873
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.166
John, you got the final word,

25:41.207 --> 25:43.084
but give us some thoughts
on that Battle.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.795
We talked a lot about being
in character for this song,

25:45.837 --> 25:50.175
and I felt like, Dia, you really
embraced that advice so well.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.886
Not only did you come out
with this dope outfit

25:52.927 --> 25:55.138
looking like a superstar,

25:55.180 --> 25:58.350
but you also carried yourself
with the demeanor of a star.

25:58.391 --> 26:02.020
Valarie, you can just
flat-out sing.
Thank you.

26:02.062 --> 26:07.025
And your voice has so much
electricity and power to it.

26:07.067 --> 26:10.987
So I have to figure out
what's the right way to go.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.822
And I'm stalling.
[ Laughs ]

26:12.864 --> 26:14.366

Valarie, congratulations!

26:50.568 --> 26:54.489
You're moving on
to the knockouts on Team Legend!

26:54.531 --> 26:57.450
John: Dia and Valarie.
I had to make a tough decision.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.577
I do believe that Dia
was a little bit better

26:59.619 --> 27:01.413
at being in character.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.456
You did so good.
You're such a great singer.
Thank you, thank you.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.792
We're just gonna keep going.
Alright?
Yes. Thank you.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.502
But I feel like
this is "The Voice,"

27:07.544 --> 27:10.088
and I still have to honor
the better vocalist

27:10.130 --> 27:11.965
when I think about who's
gonna advance on my team.

27:12.007 --> 27:13.383
Thank y'all! Thank y'all!

27:13.425 --> 27:15.510
And I feel like Valarie's
consistently been

27:15.552 --> 27:17.345
a better vocalist than Dia.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.180
Dia, anything you want
to say to your coach?

27:19.222 --> 27:21.224
Definitely.
It's an honor.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.977
This is not a loss.
This is only the beginning.
Yeah.

27:24.019 --> 27:26.312
And you will see more of
Dia Malai. Thank you.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.480
You're special!

27:27.522 --> 27:29.816
Give it up for Dia Malai,
everybody!

27:29.858 --> 27:31.317
Camila: The Battle round
are so exciting,

27:31.359 --> 27:33.236
but there's
so many talented people.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.904
It's really hard
to see people go home.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.489
You like Metallica?

27:36.531 --> 27:39.159
I only know, like, one song,
and I don't even know what song.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.910
"Enter Sandman"?
I don't even know.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.413
People have given me crap
over the years

27:43.455 --> 27:48.501
for not knowing certain songs,
but Camila is next-level.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.128
You like Guns N' Roses?

27:50.170 --> 27:52.005
I only know, like,
a few songs.

27:52.047 --> 27:54.341
One, I was not born
in America.

27:54.382 --> 27:56.009
Van Halen?

27:56.051 --> 27:58.345
I know maybe like one song.

27:58.386 --> 28:03.516
And how many songs from the past
30 years do you know, Blake?

28:03.558 --> 28:05.852
So, calm down. <i>Abuelo.</i>

28:05.894 --> 28:09.022
**

28:09.064 --> 28:11.524
Whoa!
Wow.
This place is shiny.

28:11.566 --> 28:14.986
I brought Charlie Puth
as my adviser for Team Camila.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.196
Charlie!
Camila!

28:16.237 --> 28:18.198
Thanks so much
for being here.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.866
My pleasure.
I'm right down the street.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.159
Oh, my God.
This is great.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.453
I've known Charlie
for six years now.

28:23.495 --> 28:27.123
He's an amazing singer,
producer, songwriter.

28:27.165 --> 28:29.793
I'm really, really excited.
I hope I can give --

28:29.834 --> 28:31.044
Some choreography notes?

28:31.086 --> 28:32.879
Because I clearly am
the world's best dancer.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.214
You have perfect moves.
Perfect moves.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.216
* You turn me on
like a light switch *

28:36.257 --> 28:38.551
Charlie Puth is incredible
at playing piano.

28:38.593 --> 28:42.347
He produces most, if not,
I think, all of his own songs.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.058
He's written songs for
so many successful artists, too.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.518
Justin Bieber, Maroon 5,
Pitbull.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.603
I think he can be
a great asset for Team Camila.

28:48.645 --> 28:50.605
He's gonna give some
really helpful feedback.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.565
I hope I don't let myself
get too technical

28:52.607 --> 28:54.442
because I just want them
to be themselves.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.236
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a great intention.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.947
Charlie: I wanted to be an
adviser because being able

28:58.988 --> 29:02.117
to share things
that I've learned

29:02.158 --> 29:04.369
and collected
in my musical brain

29:04.411 --> 29:05.954
with artists on "The Voice"

29:05.995 --> 29:09.290
fills my heart just as much
as having a successful song.

29:09.332 --> 29:10.875
I feel like, in a way,

29:10.917 --> 29:13.878
I could be imparting
some small amount of wisdom

29:13.920 --> 29:15.422
onto the next generation
of talent.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.173
Team Camila's
all about having fun.

29:17.215 --> 29:19.884
Well, I'm already having fun.
It's my pleasure being here.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.262
So, I have a save
and a steal.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.973
So I can steal,
for the Battle round,

29:25.015 --> 29:26.224
somebody off of...

29:26.266 --> 29:27.600
Another team.
Yeah.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.310
And let's say they were
both really great.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.604
Right.
Then I can save them.
I can save both of them.

29:31.646 --> 29:34.274
So these next two...

29:34.315 --> 29:36.985
Wait. I feel like this is about
to get really serious right now.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.445
So, Steve and Morgan
and their names.

29:38.486 --> 29:40.697
Both of them
are so experienced.

29:40.739 --> 29:45.076
They've been writing and
performing for a long time.

29:45.118 --> 29:46.619
They're both
from Nashville,

29:46.661 --> 29:48.788
so they have common ground
in their country roots.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.124
They're singing "Wrecking Ball"
by Miley Cyrus...

29:51.166 --> 29:53.251
Wow.
...which is kind of
an oddball choice...

29:53.293 --> 29:54.627
It is.
...because
they're very like --

29:54.669 --> 29:56.755
Kind of belt --
Like she sang "Hallelujah."

29:56.796 --> 30:00.050
* It's a cold
and it's a broken *

30:00.091 --> 30:04.554
* Hallelujah *

30:04.596 --> 30:06.181
And he sang
the super belt

30:06.222 --> 30:07.766
he sung in
"The Greatest Showman."

30:07.807 --> 30:10.393
* These hands
could hold the world *

30:10.435 --> 30:15.106
* But it will never be enough *

30:15.148 --> 30:17.567
You know, it's like
super pop for them.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.110
Right.
But, anyway,
let's meet them.

30:19.152 --> 30:21.571
Okay.
Come out, friends.

30:21.613 --> 30:22.989
Hey, guys!

30:23.031 --> 30:24.783
Hey!
What?!

30:24.824 --> 30:26.284
Hi!
Charlie Puth!

30:26.326 --> 30:27.577
Is that Charlie Puth?

30:27.619 --> 30:28.995
* Let's Marvin Gaye,
get it on *

30:29.037 --> 30:30.246
Oh, wow.
Whoo!

30:30.288 --> 30:31.706
Charlie Puth!

30:31.748 --> 30:35.293
He's constantly collabing
and writing and producing.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.670
I'm a big fan.
This is amazing!

30:36.711 --> 30:38.088
Thank you. Thank you.

30:38.129 --> 30:40.173
Did I just talk
to Charlie Puth?

30:40.215 --> 30:42.175
How are you guys?
Excited.

30:42.217 --> 30:43.927
Yeah.
How has it been?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.720
This is the best part --
Okay, First off,

30:45.762 --> 30:47.347
we both flew in
from Nashville together.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.848
Did you guys
know each other before?

30:48.890 --> 30:50.642
Mnh-mnh.
No.

30:50.684 --> 30:54.104
Morgan: We're both very singer
singer-songwriter types.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.231
It was a really cool mash-up,

30:56.272 --> 30:59.693
so I'm just very grateful
that she put us together.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.153
The power of a song can,
like, interrupt your world

31:02.195 --> 31:03.613
for a second,
and I hope everybody

31:03.655 --> 31:07.158
watching this feels
what we've been feeling.

31:07.200 --> 31:11.454
Life is pretty surreal
out here doing this.

31:11.496 --> 31:14.958
As a kid,
I watched my dad write songs.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.710
He was running a studio.

31:16.751 --> 31:20.213
And that instilled a lot
of knowledge around harmonies

31:20.255 --> 31:22.215
and how to be confident
on the mic.

31:22.257 --> 31:24.300
So being a successful songwriter

31:24.342 --> 31:26.720
really made my dad smile
a lot over the years.

31:26.761 --> 31:28.722
But I want to deliver
a performance that gets me

31:28.763 --> 31:32.767
to the next stage as a singer,
and this is, like, a dream.

31:32.809 --> 31:37.063
* So don't you ever say
I just walked away *

31:37.105 --> 31:39.774
* I will always want you *

31:39.816 --> 31:41.609
Camila:
I chose "Wrecking Ball" for them

31:41.651 --> 31:45.030
because they're both powerhouse
singers in different ways.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.282
And "Wrecking Ball"
is a really emotional song,

31:47.323 --> 31:49.117
and I feel like
they're great at belting

31:49.159 --> 31:51.077
and, like,
delivering those messages.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.705
* I never hit so hard
in love *

31:53.747 --> 31:57.083
Charlie: Steven's voice, it's
almost like an alto saxophone.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.710
It is loud and clear.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.338
There's not one instrument
that you can put on top of it.

32:01.379 --> 32:03.423
* You wreck me *

32:03.465 --> 32:06.801
* And I can't live a lie,
running for my life *

32:06.843 --> 32:08.762
Camila:
I think Morgan is so special.

32:08.803 --> 32:13.350
She's just so connected to her
humanity and her feelings,

32:13.391 --> 32:15.935
and it just bleeds
through her voice.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.104
That was so emotional.

32:18.146 --> 32:19.773
Yeah. Good. Good.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.358
That gave me leg chills!

32:21.399 --> 32:25.111
I feel like when you guys
lean into that honest place,

32:25.153 --> 32:27.447
like, singing it to each other,
which I feel like,

32:27.489 --> 32:29.574
Morgan, you're really,
really leaning into that.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.618
And I think, Steve, you could
lean into that even more.

32:31.659 --> 32:33.578
Right.
Because I think that
you don't even notice

32:33.620 --> 32:36.331
that it subconsciously
changes how you sing.

32:36.373 --> 32:39.292
Your body is naturally
gonna go to a place

32:39.334 --> 32:40.669
if you're thinking about

32:40.710 --> 32:42.629
a real-life situation
that happened to you.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.714
You're gonna make people
feel feelings.
Yeah.

32:44.756 --> 32:47.801
And also exploring different
textures and different emotions.

32:47.842 --> 32:48.802
Morgan: Yeah.
Right.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.470
Like, you could
whisper a line

32:50.512 --> 32:52.347
and have so much energy.

32:52.389 --> 32:54.265
That big emotion.
You know what I mean?

32:54.307 --> 32:55.975
Like -- Like an actor.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.394
I really relate with, like,

32:57.435 --> 32:59.854
"Don't ever say
I just walked away."

32:59.896 --> 33:02.607
Yeah.
I know how much
I've shown up.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.067
Like, "Don't you ever say."

33:04.109 --> 33:06.361
"Don't <i>ever</i>say I didn't
show up. Because I did."

33:06.403 --> 33:07.946
* I just walked away *

33:07.987 --> 33:10.824
Steven: This song is easy
to connect with, even though,

33:10.865 --> 33:13.243
you know, I'm not talking
about a big breakup.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.370
I've been married
for 18 years almost.

33:15.412 --> 33:17.997
But we know heartbreak because
that kind of comes along

33:18.039 --> 33:19.541
with the territory of love.

33:19.582 --> 33:22.627
This song is saying it
raw and unfiltered.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.337
Morgan, do you feel like
you experience

33:24.379 --> 33:26.756
a lot of emotions
in this, too?
Oh, yeah.

33:26.798 --> 33:30.844
I have had, we'll just say,
a very, very toxic person

33:30.885 --> 33:32.137
in my life.

33:32.178 --> 33:35.640
The more I was succeeding,
the more that person

33:35.682 --> 33:38.560
needed to take control
and bring me down to the point

33:38.601 --> 33:42.605
that I really did become
a complete shell of myself.

33:42.647 --> 33:45.650
So it's easy to go there
in this song.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.361
* Our hearts in vain,
we jumped *

33:48.403 --> 33:50.405
There's two different ways
of singing it, right?

33:50.447 --> 33:51.865
Like, you could go --

33:51.906 --> 33:53.992
* We clawed,
we chained our *
Mm-hmm.

33:54.034 --> 33:55.368
Or you could do the --

33:55.410 --> 33:59.080
* We clawed, we dah,
dah-nah, nah-dah *

33:59.122 --> 34:00.999
The slide is nice.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.460
Maybe later in it because
it's a bit more theatrical.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.420
But when you started off
like -- * We clawed *

34:05.462 --> 34:07.589
It's, like, actually
really nice. Yeah.

34:07.630 --> 34:10.592
You are gonna be having
your therapy session

34:10.633 --> 34:12.635
in front of a lot
of people, basically,

34:12.677 --> 34:16.014
and you are living these
vulnerable human feelings.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.683
It's kind of like telling a
monologue about your life story,

34:18.725 --> 34:21.186
is basically what this song
should feel like.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.396
* Came in like a wrecking ball *

34:23.438 --> 34:25.440
Camila: I think this Battle
is gonna be about

34:25.482 --> 34:28.526
who makes people
feel the feelings.

34:28.568 --> 34:31.112
Like, I think it's gonna be
about who can connect

34:31.154 --> 34:33.114
in the moment to that honesty.

34:33.156 --> 34:35.909
* You wreck me *

34:35.950 --> 34:37.160
Sick, guys.

34:37.202 --> 34:38.495
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.413
Morgan: It's been
a really cool experience.

34:40.455 --> 34:41.915
They gave really good feedback.

34:41.956 --> 34:44.417
I'm excited
that they were excited.

34:44.459 --> 34:45.919
Going with Camila, after today,

34:45.960 --> 34:47.837
I knew I made
the right decision.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.422
Y'all are awesome.
This is fun!

34:49.464 --> 34:51.591
That's gonna be
a hard one for Camila.

34:51.633 --> 34:52.801
Pray for us.
Yeah.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.511
No, guys.
It's gonna be so good.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.262
No! You got it!
Yeah, you have got it.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.347
Thank you!
It's there!

34:57.389 --> 34:58.682
I am super happy

34:58.723 --> 35:00.100
I do not have to make
the decision.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.601
They're good, right?

35:01.643 --> 35:03.895
They have that voice that, like,
cuts through on a record.

35:03.937 --> 35:05.855
Yeah. Totally.

35:11.319 --> 35:12.529
* This is "The Voice" *

35:12.570 --> 35:14.364
Daly:
Welcome back to the Battles.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.491
[ Cheers and applause ]

35:16.533 --> 35:18.284
Yeah!
Ohh!

35:18.326 --> 35:19.452
Whoo!

35:19.494 --> 35:21.162
Let the Battle begin.

35:21.204 --> 35:24.332
[ Cheers and applause ]

35:24.374 --> 35:31.423
**

35:31.464 --> 35:35.260
* We clawed, we chained
our hearts in vain *

35:35.301 --> 35:36.761
* We jumped *

35:36.803 --> 35:38.972
Together:
* Never asking why *

35:39.014 --> 35:43.018
* We kissed, I fell
under your spell *

35:43.059 --> 35:44.269
* A love *

35:44.310 --> 35:46.938
* No one could deny *

35:46.980 --> 35:51.192
* So don't you ever say
I just walked away *

35:51.234 --> 35:54.738
* I will always want you *

35:54.779 --> 35:58.658
* I can't live a lie,
running for my life *

35:58.700 --> 36:03.038
* I will always want you *

36:03.079 --> 36:06.875
* I came in
like a wrecking ball *

36:06.916 --> 36:10.337
* I never hit so hard
in love *

36:10.378 --> 36:14.424
* All I wanted was
to break your walls *

36:14.466 --> 36:16.593
* All you
ever did was *

36:16.634 --> 36:18.928
* Wreck me *

36:18.970 --> 36:23.725
* Yeah, you, you wreck me *

36:23.767 --> 36:28.229

* Never meant
to start a war *

36:34.569 --> 36:35.987
* Just wanted you to *

36:36.029 --> 36:38.406
* Let me in *

* I guess instead of

* Using force *

to break your walls *

37:14.484 --> 37:16.236
* Wreck me *

37:45.473 --> 37:48.226
Yeah!
Yeah.

37:48.268 --> 37:49.477
Yeah.

37:49.519 --> 37:51.104
That was so good!

37:51.146 --> 37:52.272
Ooh. [ Laughs ]

37:52.313 --> 37:53.398
Camila, wow.

37:53.440 --> 37:57.652
I know! I know.

37:57.694 --> 38:01.281
It's crazy how good
your voices sound together.

38:01.322 --> 38:05.577
Steve, you have a lot of
beautiful tones in your voice.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.495
It was very complementary
to Morgan,

38:07.537 --> 38:08.997
and it's hard
to separate it

38:09.039 --> 38:12.000
because Morgan was
working the fringe,

38:12.042 --> 38:13.335
first of all.

38:13.376 --> 38:14.669
Yeah, killing it.

38:14.711 --> 38:16.838
What I loved about your
performance, I think,

38:16.880 --> 38:18.840
was even before the chorus,

38:18.882 --> 38:20.842
I thought that you had given us
what you were gonna give us,

38:20.884 --> 38:23.553
and then when the chorus
came in, it was chilling.

38:23.595 --> 38:24.888
Like, it was crazy.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.474
And it was such
a great duet.

38:27.515 --> 38:28.808
Yeah.
Thank you.

38:28.850 --> 38:31.478
You both are just
really good singers.

38:31.519 --> 38:33.021
You have such
different tones.

38:33.063 --> 38:35.607
Steven, yours is kind of smooth,
and it's beautiful,

38:35.648 --> 38:37.108
and you have great range.
Thank you.

38:37.150 --> 38:39.527
Morgan's tone is just like fire,
you know?

38:39.569 --> 38:41.654
It's like -- One of the things
I love about Miley,

38:41.696 --> 38:43.615
I think she has
one of the coolest tones

38:43.656 --> 38:45.533
in pop music these days.

38:45.575 --> 38:48.036
I think, Morgan,
you remind me

38:48.078 --> 38:50.163
of that kind of singer
that has that raspiness.

38:50.205 --> 38:51.998
You just sound like
a recording artist

38:52.040 --> 38:54.584
that should be making records
and singing at the Grammys.

38:54.626 --> 38:58.963
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you so much. Ah.

38:59.005 --> 39:00.965
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
I think Steven --

39:01.007 --> 39:03.051
Man, you sang the hell
out of that thing, dude.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.387
I mean, you really did.
Thank you.

39:05.428 --> 39:07.597
Nothing about that
could have been simple.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.307
[ Laughter ]

39:09.349 --> 39:11.476
The thing about Morgan is
she's hanging in there with you,

39:11.518 --> 39:13.019
but then she hits

39:13.061 --> 39:15.897
that Bonnie Tyler gear
that you just go, "Whoa!"

39:15.939 --> 39:18.066
You know,
she not only hit that note,

39:18.108 --> 39:21.569
but it makes her voice do
that shred deal that it does.

39:21.611 --> 39:24.322
I would probably
go with Morgan.

39:24.364 --> 39:25.907
Thank you so much.

39:25.949 --> 39:28.618
Daly:
Thank you, Coaches.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.120
Camila, the final decision
is yours,

39:30.161 --> 39:32.455
but first give us some thoughts
on the Battle

39:32.497 --> 39:33.915
and then tell us the winner.

39:33.957 --> 39:37.335
That was my first Battle
as a coach on "The Voice,"

39:37.377 --> 39:42.757
and I had the pleasure
of welling up with pride.

39:42.799 --> 39:45.427
And, Morgan,
you have the gift

39:45.468 --> 39:47.053
of feeling things really deeply,

39:47.095 --> 39:49.973
and I think that just comes out
through your voice,

39:50.015 --> 39:53.018
but it also comes out
through your whole body

39:53.059 --> 39:54.477
when you're performing.

39:54.519 --> 39:57.522
And at the same time,
Steven, I don't think

39:57.564 --> 40:00.066
that we have
tapped into the song

40:00.108 --> 40:02.944
that has, like, brought
the house down yet.

40:02.986 --> 40:05.405
People don't know
what you can do yet.
Yeah.

40:05.447 --> 40:06.906
So I think both of you guys,

40:06.948 --> 40:08.950
I truly believe,
are so, so special.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.660
Tough decision, Camila.

40:10.702 --> 40:14.456
Who is the winner
of this battle?

40:14.497 --> 40:16.791
The winner
of this battle...

40:16.833 --> 40:22.130
**

40:22.172 --> 40:23.923
...is Morgan.

40:23.965 --> 40:26.259
Daly: Morgan moving on
to the knockouts!

40:26.301 --> 40:28.428
Congratulations!

40:28.470 --> 40:30.347
Camila: I was so proud
of Morgan and Steven.

40:30.388 --> 40:32.307
They both did a great job,
but I chose Morgan

40:32.349 --> 40:36.311
because I think that
she's irreplaceable on the show.

40:36.353 --> 40:38.104
Nobody can emote
like her.

40:38.146 --> 40:39.564
You look so beautiful.
Thank you.

40:39.606 --> 40:42.067
I think Morgan is somebody
that could definitely go

40:42.108 --> 40:43.193
all the way to the finale.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.653
Great job, Morgan.
Thank you.

40:45.695 --> 40:47.238
I feel very relieved.
[ Laughs ]

40:47.280 --> 40:49.657
Daly: Coaches, let me
remind you that Steven

40:49.699 --> 40:50.992
is available
to steal or save.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.911
Steven, anything you
want to say to Camila?

40:52.952 --> 40:56.664
Thank you so much.
I'm so honored to be up
here singing for y'all.

40:56.706 --> 40:58.750
This has been so fun.
Thank you.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.336
Give it up one more time
for Steven McMorran,

41:10.887 --> 41:12.263
Yes! Aah!

41:12.305 --> 41:14.182
We've got a save!

41:14.224 --> 41:16.434
Oh, my gosh!
I wasn't expecting that!

41:16.476 --> 41:20.146
Camila not letting anybody
on her team leave today!

41:20.188 --> 41:22.315
This is an emotional
roller coaster!

41:22.357 --> 41:23.858
I can't sleep peacefully

41:23.900 --> 41:26.736
knowing that we have not
cracked the code yet,

41:26.778 --> 41:28.488
that moment for you,
that song.

41:28.530 --> 41:29.698
Thank you.

41:29.739 --> 41:31.533
Daly: Give it up
for Steven McMorran!

41:31.574 --> 41:35.078
I only get one save,
and I see something in Steven

41:35.120 --> 41:37.914
that I want others to see.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.542
That was so cool!
So cool.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.712
The fact that Camila
used her one save on me

41:43.753 --> 41:45.714
has me feeling pretty humbled.

41:45.755 --> 41:49.050
Still in the game, baby!
Whoo!

41:49.092 --> 41:51.344
You saved me.
Thank you.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.388
Nice work, Camila.
Thanks, Blakers.

41:53.430 --> 41:55.724
I keep wanting to be
turned. I was like,
"When are we turning?"

41:55.765 --> 41:58.059
I was just thinking. I was like,
"They're about to turn us."

41:58.101 --> 42:00.437
I miss the turn.
I miss the danger.
