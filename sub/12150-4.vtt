00:01.929 --> 00:03.120
Previously on Angel:

00:03.729 --> 00:05.830
- I'm Lilah Morgan.
- Wolfram & Hart.

00:06.129 --> 00:10.630
I'm an associate here.
We're all pleased you're here, Darla.

00:11.529 --> 00:15.919
- I can't believe you're here.
- Let Darla take care of you.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.000
All you have to do is let me.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:00.130 --> 01:02.090
Exciting, isn't it?

01:03.130 --> 01:04.530
Darla.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.040
I didn't see you.

01:07.930 --> 01:11.859
Going through their things.
The hidden pieces of themselves...

01:12.129 --> 01:15.040
...locked up, giving you
a thrill of control.

01:16.930 --> 01:19.099
I keep up with his latest project.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.629
He's probably in my office right now.

01:22.930 --> 01:25.319
That's just how it works at our firm.

01:26.530 --> 01:30.849
All you busy little worker bees,
plotting your little schemes.

01:32.530 --> 01:33.650
Calynthia powder?

01:34.930 --> 01:38.370
That's how you keep Angel sleeping
when he's with you?

01:39.129 --> 01:42.920
There's nothing so lovely as dreams.
Everything's in them.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.359
Everything hidden.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.780
Open those chambers,
you'll truly understand someone...

01:49.930 --> 01:51.959
...and control them.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.719
And what's hidden
in Angel's secret chambers?

01:58.329 --> 01:59.379
Horrors.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.510
- That's typical of your type.
- At least I'm not a sheep.

02:07.849 --> 02:11.360
- I'm not a sheep!
- You've never had a single opinion...

02:12.050 --> 02:14.219
- ...You didn't read.
- At least I read.

02:15.050 --> 02:18.419
Don't even try it.
I was top 10 percent of my class.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.460
What class? "Advanced Bosoms"?

02:21.650 --> 02:24.110
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

02:24.650 --> 02:28.340
We were discussing whether or not
we should pay Gunn.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.659
- No, you weren't.
- Our discussions last three minutes.

02:35.449 --> 02:39.379
- Then it's strictly name-calling.
- Ebenezer doesn't want to share.

02:39.650 --> 02:42.879
I merely said Gunn
might be insulted by the offer.

02:43.849 --> 02:47.919
- He's a proud sort of fellow.
- He's been helping. He should be paid.

02:48.650 --> 02:51.530
- I'll think about it.
- No think. Pay.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.060
How about we pretend
that you work for me?

02:55.250 --> 02:58.870
- You're so unpleasant when--
- Let's pretend that you don't.

03:00.050 --> 03:02.509
You can't fire me. I'm Vision Girl.

03:06.849 --> 03:11.030
Okay, I'll think about asking him.
Maybe on a case-by-case.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.349
- My hero.
- I was gonna suggest that.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.229
Mm-hm.

03:16.449 --> 03:20.770
- Is there coffee?
- In the morning. It's 10:00 at night.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.949
I was disoriented.
I've been sleeping weird.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.620
Weird how?

03:30.849 --> 03:31.969
I don't know.

03:32.650 --> 03:36.689
It's been like this for a bit.
You sleep more, you're less rested.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.729
Are you dreaming?

03:47.050 --> 03:49.219
Boys, I think we have a customer.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.090
Okay, a girl. She's in an alley.

03:57.849 --> 03:59.530
Hollywood and Wilcox.

04:02.050 --> 04:04.189
- Oh, she's so scared.
- Go.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.520
God, he's gonna be too late.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.100
Why are you making us run around?

04:26.050 --> 04:30.019
Hey, I get it first.
Think I want your seconds? You pig.

04:32.050 --> 04:33.660
The guy's a pig.

05:47.449 --> 05:50.079
- So what do we got here?
- You're not--

05:50.449 --> 05:54.870
Get behind the tape. You wanna gawk,
go watch a high-speed chase on Fox.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.810
- Keep the tourists away.
- But--

05:58.250 --> 06:02.600
I'm out of Vice three weeks,
I come back to all this amateur crap.

06:03.649 --> 06:07.300
Pretend you're not a Cub Scout
and tell me about this.

06:07.850 --> 06:11.110
Well, detective, we had
to scrape him off the wall.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.399
Guys got pinned by a two-ton dumpster.

06:15.050 --> 06:18.740
- It fell on them?
- No, they were pinned to the wall.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.879
Looks like somebody
shoved it from the side.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.500
Have to be pretty strong.

06:27.649 --> 06:30.879
You're telling me.
Splashed them all the way up here.

06:36.649 --> 06:38.120
That's not their blood.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.050
Excuse me?

06:41.449 --> 06:45.350
You seen a girl tonight?
Maybe a little scared and beat up?

06:46.250 --> 06:47.829
Nobody but our Mr. Bills.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.110
You know, "Oh, no, Mr. Bill!"

06:52.850 --> 06:54.110
Right.

07:00.649 --> 07:02.329
So, what do we got here?

07:24.170 --> 07:25.639
Hey.

07:26.569 --> 07:27.759
What do you want?

07:28.970 --> 07:31.139
- You're bleeding.
- Stay away from me.

07:31.970 --> 07:35.899
- I just wanna ask you a few questions.
- You don't understand.

07:36.769 --> 07:41.339
I'm really upset right now,
and I think it's best if you just--

07:42.170 --> 07:45.120
- You were in that alley, weren't you?
- No! I mean....

07:45.769 --> 07:47.279
What alley?

07:47.569 --> 07:49.670
- I'm going.
- Hold on a second.

07:54.769 --> 07:58.740
Oh, God! I told you.
I tried to tell you.

08:00.170 --> 08:01.500
Please wait.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.199
What are you?

08:15.769 --> 08:18.540
I've come to help you.
My name is Angel.

08:20.569 --> 08:23.589
I stabbed an angel.
Now I'll never get into heaven.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.149
I'm not an angel. It's just a name.

08:27.769 --> 08:29.870
But how did you--?

08:31.370 --> 08:35.200
Well, I'm different
from most people, like you are.

08:37.970 --> 08:41.940
Those men in the alley,
they tried to hurt you, didn't they?

08:43.970 --> 08:47.659
- But you stopped them.
- I didn't mean to. They followed me.

08:48.169 --> 08:50.379
- It wasn't--
- It's okay.

08:51.169 --> 08:54.720
- Yeah, it's just great.
- You're not from L.A., are you?

08:55.970 --> 08:57.649
You got family in town?

09:00.169 --> 09:01.610
Me neither.

09:03.769 --> 09:06.649
Town kind of attracts loners,
don't you think?

09:07.370 --> 09:09.860
You can't make me go
anywhere with you.

09:12.169 --> 09:14.240
I think that message got through.

09:15.769 --> 09:17.070
I would never try.

09:18.169 --> 09:19.820
Wait.

09:20.570 --> 09:21.730
Take this.

09:23.570 --> 09:26.269
If you need anything,
a place to stay....

09:27.169 --> 09:29.940
- I'm staying with a friend.
- Someone to talk to.

09:30.769 --> 09:32.279
Think about it.

09:33.769 --> 09:35.139
I won't hurt you...

09:36.169 --> 09:38.029
...and you can't hurt me.

09:39.769 --> 09:41.309
You may need that.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.990
Okay, maybe she can hurt me a little.

10:10.370 --> 10:12.759
- Bethany.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

10:13.370 --> 10:15.470
I was starting to get worried.

10:24.769 --> 10:27.509
So how was the club? You have any fun?

10:28.370 --> 10:31.529
- It was okay.
- Any cute boys?

10:33.169 --> 10:37.740
Sorry I didn't go. Work got insane.
Our new clients are monsters.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.889
- Here, let me.
- Oh, I like folding.

10:41.570 --> 10:44.409
It's like a Zen exercise.
It levels me out.

10:45.169 --> 10:48.190
You've gotta let me help.
I've gotta at least--

10:48.769 --> 10:50.909
It's enough, you letting me stay.

10:51.169 --> 10:54.889
Didn't we vow you'd stop that?
Didn't we make a blood oath?

10:55.970 --> 10:58.429
I love having you here.

11:00.169 --> 11:04.240
You know, when you came
and spoke at our school, I was so:

11:05.570 --> 11:09.429
"There was someone who got out,
made it by themselves."

11:10.370 --> 11:13.419
- I'm saying it wrong. I--
- No, you're not.

11:15.169 --> 11:17.769
I couldn't believe
you even talked to me.

11:18.169 --> 11:21.679
See, you have no idea.
You're special, Bethany.

11:22.970 --> 11:25.320
In the non-retarded sense of the word.

11:25.970 --> 11:30.179
You think I tour high schools
saying "look me up" to everyone I meet?

11:31.370 --> 11:33.440
You have a power about you.

11:34.370 --> 11:37.039
Other people will start to know that.

11:39.769 --> 11:43.350
- I guess I'm getting kind of sleepy.
- I bet you are.

11:44.570 --> 11:48.399
I'm still kind of wired.
I might stare at the TV for a while.

11:49.370 --> 11:50.879
Good night, Lilah.

11:53.570 --> 11:55.179
Sweet dreams.

11:57.649 --> 12:00.950
I can't get this bandage to....
Stop moving.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.179
- I'm not.
- Then stop breathing.

12:03.649 --> 12:04.769
I don't breathe.

12:05.450 --> 12:09.240
Then stop flexing your manly
boob muscles, or whatever.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.059
- That's an ugly wound.
- Doesn't feel pretty.

12:13.850 --> 12:18.419
We should approach her with caution.
I guess you already figured that out.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.159
She's very powerful.
We must find out all we can.

12:22.850 --> 12:26.289
- Like oh, say, her name?
- I was impaled at the time.

12:27.049 --> 12:29.259
Of course. Perfectly understandable.

12:30.049 --> 12:34.299
You know how hard it is to think
straight with a rebar in your torso?

12:35.450 --> 12:38.610
Actually, I do.
Benefits of a Sunnydale education.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.240
- No address or anything?
- She's staying with a friend.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.580
Where do we keep the list
of "people with friends"?

12:47.450 --> 12:51.139
She's not local. Traces of an accent.
Northeast. Maybe Ohio.

12:51.649 --> 12:54.179
Everything about her says
she's on the run.

12:54.649 --> 12:58.549
- Look into northeastern runaways.
- Crossed with supernatural events.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.799
The way she is, she's not low-profile.

13:02.450 --> 13:05.539
Angel, you sure this isn't
a demon of some kind?

13:06.049 --> 13:09.419
- She's just a girl.
- One that could kill you by blinking.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.129
She needs help.
She's out of control.

13:13.850 --> 13:18.559
She's just lost.
What do we know about telekinesis?

13:20.450 --> 13:24.419
Ah, yes. The power of
moving things with one's mind.

13:26.450 --> 13:29.330
That's pretty much it.
The power of moving....

13:31.850 --> 13:34.200
I'm better with demons, really.

13:34.850 --> 13:36.809
Time to broaden your horizons.

13:39.649 --> 13:43.269
You call, I come.
Loaded for bear, ready for battle....

13:43.850 --> 13:45.809
- Any other "B" thing.
- What's that?

13:46.250 --> 13:49.509
Isn't this the thing?
My camp kids put it together.

13:49.850 --> 13:53.360
- I wanted to use it tonight.
- Men are all alike.

13:55.250 --> 13:58.870
- Fair one, you still saving my life?
- Every minute.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.700
- How's it going?
- You're alive, right?

14:02.450 --> 14:05.820
What kind of scaly pus-monster
will I slay this time?

14:06.049 --> 14:07.799
We need you to do legwork.

14:08.450 --> 14:11.429
Legwork? That means
I can't use my cool new ax.

14:12.049 --> 14:13.909
I'm trying to find a girl.

14:15.049 --> 14:17.399
She smashed two rapists
with a dumpster.

14:18.049 --> 14:20.610
- She must be hefty.
- We think she's psychic.

14:21.049 --> 14:25.370
- Telekinesis: the power of moving--
- I have heard the word.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.610
What should I do?

14:27.649 --> 14:30.139
- Find out about the guys who got--
- Smooshed?

14:31.250 --> 14:34.440
--near your neighborhood.
You think you can find them?

14:34.850 --> 14:37.620
Sure. But if I return on
the end of a spatula...

14:38.450 --> 14:40.980
...I'm expecting some
serious workman's comp.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.870
See? Workman's comp.
He wants to get paid.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.179
Cordelia--

14:45.649 --> 14:47.509
The poor man can't even
afford a real ax!

14:48.049 --> 14:49.100
Okay, okay.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.090
Look, I'll bring it up.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.919
I'm going to bed.
It's been a long day.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.279
You've been up for three hours.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.190
Cordelia....

15:03.049 --> 15:04.659
Find the girl.

16:11.049 --> 16:12.980
Shh, Rabbit.

16:17.649 --> 16:20.110
Let's go downstairs. Just you and me.

16:26.049 --> 16:28.220
Don't make a fuss, Rabbit.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.769
- Bethany....
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.309
Don't. Don't go!

17:10.450 --> 17:13.680
Remember, don't you?
In front of the fire...

17:14.049 --> 17:17.809
...with the gypsy girl,
all bound and gagged.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.880
We took her right there.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.160
We sucked her blood till she was dry.

17:49.089 --> 17:49.960
Well?

17:50.890 --> 17:53.349
Top of the middle of the day
to you too.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.500
No leads worth mentioning.

17:56.289 --> 17:59.410
Of course, we lost time
during my hour of sleep.

17:59.890 --> 18:03.539
Good thing I left clothes here,
or you'd smell me even now.

18:04.089 --> 18:05.279
Gunn check in?

18:05.890 --> 18:07.960
How about you? How's it coming?

18:08.289 --> 18:12.859
Most of my reading suggests that
telekinesis is a psychic phenomenon...

18:13.690 --> 18:16.710
...that occurs during
extreme emotional distress.

18:17.289 --> 18:20.410
That tracks. We gotta find her.

18:21.490 --> 18:23.880
Well, I think I may have a lead.

18:35.890 --> 18:37.049
How are you?

18:39.490 --> 18:42.299
Bethany. Bethany Chaulk.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.680
You said I couldn't hurt you.

18:47.890 --> 18:51.329
- That if I needed anything....
- You're safe here.

18:53.890 --> 18:56.349
We're all safe people.

18:58.089 --> 19:01.990
This is Wesley and Cordelia.

19:04.690 --> 19:07.109
So it's a family business, huh?

19:07.690 --> 19:09.970
Friends. Come on in.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.859
Sorry.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.119
I'm just so tired.

19:26.289 --> 19:29.240
- Would you like some tea?
- Yeah, please.

19:33.490 --> 19:37.529
You shouldn't worry. Angel does
this kind of thing all the time.

19:38.289 --> 19:40.150
Makes tea?

19:40.690 --> 19:44.480
Helps people. You know,
he helps people with problems.

19:46.089 --> 19:50.130
- So what's wrong with you?
- Where to begin?

19:53.289 --> 19:57.609
Well, our little girl gave you
one heck of a shiner, didn't she?

19:58.089 --> 20:00.440
Was the L.A. scenario too much?

20:01.089 --> 20:03.970
I assure you, I have
the utmost confidence that--

20:04.690 --> 20:06.900
Don't "utmost confidence" me.

20:07.690 --> 20:10.710
Some might say you've lost
control of this girl.

20:11.289 --> 20:14.519
If so, what happens when you
pull the trigger?

20:14.890 --> 20:19.279
She has the profile. But an assassin's
no good if it can't be controlled.

20:20.890 --> 20:22.680
But do you know what I say?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.289
Nonsense.

20:26.289 --> 20:28.609
I say Lilah Morgan found this girl...

20:28.690 --> 20:31.390
...Lilah Morgan recruited
this girl for a reason...

20:32.289 --> 20:34.750
...and Lilah Morgan's gonna
bring this girl...

20:35.289 --> 20:38.380
...into the welcoming arms
of Wolfram & Hart.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.819
I will find her.

20:44.890 --> 20:46.079
Hello.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.569
Bethany.

20:52.089 --> 20:55.420
No, I am so glad you called.
I was worried.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.450
No, I'm fine.

20:59.890 --> 21:01.329
Where are you?

21:08.529 --> 21:11.160
They're Cordy's. I feel kind of funny.

21:12.130 --> 21:13.289
You look nice.

21:14.529 --> 21:17.369
You get ahold of your friend?
Is she okay?

21:18.130 --> 21:21.640
She says she's fine. Worried about me.

21:22.329 --> 21:26.230
How do you explain...?
She'd just think I'm crazy.

21:27.730 --> 21:29.480
- Are you?
- What?

21:30.130 --> 21:32.970
Well, if you are, you know, crazy...

21:33.130 --> 21:37.380
...I just think things will go
smoother if I know up front.

21:39.130 --> 21:41.269
I probably am.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.339
I don't wanna....

21:44.529 --> 21:48.289
I don't wanna talk about me
and share, or whatever.

21:49.930 --> 21:51.750
We can talk about stuff, but....

21:53.529 --> 21:56.019
I don't know.
You're the expert, right?

21:56.529 --> 21:59.940
I wouldn't say that.
I just have experience in dealing...

22:00.730 --> 22:03.259
...with the kind of power
that needs control.

22:03.730 --> 22:06.680
I don't want to control it.
I want it gone.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.660
- What is she doing?
- They're talking, yes?

22:15.730 --> 22:20.150
There's something. She's got a vibe.
I'm getting a vibe. She's vibe-y.

22:20.529 --> 22:22.250
I didn't notice a vibe.

22:22.930 --> 22:25.839
All evidence to the contrary,
you're not a woman.

22:26.529 --> 22:30.670
Women and sex. It's not like you guys.
We see more levels.

22:33.130 --> 22:34.880
Are you even listening?

22:35.529 --> 22:39.849
It's like there's a flash.
Like something pops in my brain.

22:40.930 --> 22:42.190
And then...

22:42.730 --> 22:46.029
...it's like there's an undertow,
like there's no gravity.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.700
My body's being pulled
in different directions...

22:50.529 --> 22:52.210
...but inside, you know?

22:52.930 --> 22:54.009
Does it hurt?

22:54.730 --> 22:58.309
Yes. No. Just for a second,
then I'm back.

22:58.930 --> 23:01.490
You only feel it
when you make things move?

23:01.930 --> 23:06.279
I don't make them move. When I come to,
things aren't where I left them.

23:07.329 --> 23:10.210
- You've never done it on purpose?
- Of course not.

23:10.329 --> 23:13.839
You never thought, "That remote's far.
I'd have to get up--"

23:14.529 --> 23:16.109
It's not a parlor trick!

23:16.930 --> 23:18.930
It's-- It's a disease.

23:19.930 --> 23:23.970
We don't know what it is yet.
I just want to know about you.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.339
Don't ask stupid questions.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.039
"When were you potty-trained?
Name all your pets.

23:30.730 --> 23:32.519
Do you like hide-and-seek?"

23:33.130 --> 23:36.890
- They weren't on my list.
- You know nothing! I shouldn't be here.

23:37.930 --> 23:42.500
I agree. She doesn't want our help.
Let's not waste our time with her.

23:43.329 --> 23:45.859
- Wesley--
- There are people who need us...

23:46.329 --> 23:49.000
...with graver issues
than impulse control.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.319
- That's enough.
- Send her to her friend's.

23:52.930 --> 23:56.720
Toss the furniture. Maybe we
should send you to your father.

24:15.130 --> 24:17.690
- You sure nothing's broken?
- I'm sure.

24:18.130 --> 24:21.180
Nothing at all? Say, your brain?

24:22.329 --> 24:24.680
What happened to
"approach with caution" ?

24:25.329 --> 24:27.220
If she'd gotten her defenses up--

24:27.130 --> 24:31.059
She wouldn't be crying,
and you and Angel wouldn't be hurt.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.299
What did you say?

24:33.730 --> 24:37.140
- I mentioned her father.
- Well, who's her father?

24:37.930 --> 24:40.740
The trauma that can
produce psychic power...

24:41.529 --> 24:44.440
...usually involves abuse
of some kind, early on.

24:45.130 --> 24:47.130
You'd mentioned a sexual vibe.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.650
She made that crack
about "family business."

24:51.130 --> 24:54.460
Statistically speaking,
the father was the best guess.

24:55.930 --> 24:58.279
There's not enough yuck in the world.

24:59.529 --> 25:01.390
- How is she?
- Settling. You, go.

25:01.930 --> 25:05.190
You can't fire him! I'll quit too!
Unless you're firm.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.740
I'm not firing anyone.

25:07.930 --> 25:11.579
My presence won't help her
trust issues. I'll be at my flat.

25:12.130 --> 25:13.779
Call me if....

25:16.930 --> 25:18.609
It helps that we know.

25:20.529 --> 25:22.039
I hope so.

25:22.930 --> 25:25.910
- Stay at your place, in case she--
- Be careful.

25:27.730 --> 25:29.690
I doubt she'll go off again.

25:41.529 --> 25:42.650
There you are.

25:46.329 --> 25:48.079
I came up here.

25:49.329 --> 25:51.259
I feel safe up here.

25:52.930 --> 25:56.829
You did pick the one room
that may collapse to feel safe in.

25:59.529 --> 26:01.740
I'm really embarrassed.

26:02.529 --> 26:04.490
And that just makes me....

26:06.730 --> 26:09.819
Horrible things have happened,
been done to me.

26:10.329 --> 26:12.009
Guys have died...

26:13.329 --> 26:16.099
...and I'm freaking
because I'm so embarrassed.

26:18.130 --> 26:20.299
People are pathetic.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.059
I don't know.

26:25.329 --> 26:26.769
I like them.

26:29.529 --> 26:33.990
The time I've lived, I've seen
some horrors, scary behavior...

26:34.930 --> 26:39.069
...and a couple of fashion trends
I constantly pray to forget.

26:39.730 --> 26:41.589
But I see people try.

26:42.730 --> 26:47.049
- I've seen them try to be better.
- You sound like an old guy.

26:48.730 --> 26:51.289
Oh, you know, I'm very well-preserved.

26:52.930 --> 26:56.970
I'd like that.
To see people the way you do.

27:39.130 --> 27:41.019
- Darla?
- It's just me.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.049
What's up?

27:45.130 --> 27:48.009
What's--? Is there trouble?

27:48.730 --> 27:50.940
I just didn't want to sleep.

27:51.730 --> 27:55.279
I heard a voice in here
and thought maybe you were awake.

27:55.930 --> 27:57.650
I was having a nightmare.

27:58.930 --> 28:03.500
It looked like a pretty happy dream.
Or maybe the covers were just rumpled.

28:06.130 --> 28:09.180
I figured I'd come in.
It's nicer than my room.

28:10.930 --> 28:13.700
Is there something
you wanted to talk about?

28:15.130 --> 28:16.880
No.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.609
I figured we'd have fun.

28:19.329 --> 28:21.750
You can do stuff to me
and, you know...

28:24.130 --> 28:26.900
- ...we'll have some fun.
- That's not gonna happen.

28:27.730 --> 28:31.559
Like I'm some frightened little mouse?
I've done stuff.

28:31.930 --> 28:34.180
I can make you happy.

28:35.529 --> 28:38.019
You wouldn't like me when I'm happy.

28:40.930 --> 28:42.930
- Come on.
- It won't mean anything.

28:43.329 --> 28:45.190
- I said stop it.
- Get off me!

28:49.329 --> 28:52.000
You wanna make love,
but not be touched?

28:52.329 --> 28:55.210
"Make love"?
Are you from the 18th century?

28:58.930 --> 29:02.579
- I was just.... I just wanted--
- What did you want?

29:03.730 --> 29:08.259
- Are you shocked I'm a great big slut?
- You'll find I'm not easily shocked.

29:12.130 --> 29:16.450
Everyone thinks I'm so fragile
and innocent. Men love it.

29:17.529 --> 29:20.089
- Do you?
- Do I love it?

29:20.529 --> 29:21.930
Who cares?

29:24.130 --> 29:26.759
I'm like the chambermaid.

29:27.730 --> 29:29.099
I just leave.

29:31.329 --> 29:33.220
When a guy's on me, I....

29:34.930 --> 29:37.880
I made up the room, I showed him in...

29:38.529 --> 29:40.740
...and I leave till he's gone.

29:42.730 --> 29:45.990
Come back and clean up the mess.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.759
And the men?

29:52.329 --> 29:55.519
You think they'd notice
or care I'm not there?

29:55.930 --> 29:57.259
Would you?

29:59.529 --> 30:04.029
- Everyone's not as bad as you think.
- Oh, right. You love the people.

30:06.130 --> 30:09.890
You love them so much you've got
100 rooms to be alone in.

30:12.730 --> 30:16.559
I'm thinking maybe you're not
exactly qualified to help me.

30:18.730 --> 30:21.289
Maybe I'm the only one who is.

30:23.529 --> 30:26.440
- Try to get some sleep.
- Who's Darla?

30:28.329 --> 30:29.630
Good night, Bethany.

30:44.289 --> 30:46.180
He's not sleeping,

30:46.690 --> 30:49.640
- It puts a cramp in Lindsey's project.
- Yes, but--

30:50.289 --> 30:52.319
Lindsey understands the big picture.

30:53.289 --> 30:55.710
All his efforts
go towards that picture.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.539
Your girl is messing up his efforts.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.289
- I understand, sir.
- I know you do.

31:02.289 --> 31:05.619
Get her out. Not just for the sake
of the big picture.

31:07.690 --> 31:09.269
For yours.

31:12.490 --> 31:14.950
I feel funny. Sweaty funny, I think.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.309
Just try. You can always stop.

31:17.890 --> 31:21.299
- What if it blows up?
- I'll buy Cordelia a new one.

31:23.289 --> 31:26.170
Okay. Just drop it on the floor.

31:44.890 --> 31:45.940
See?

31:46.690 --> 31:48.690
You can control it.

31:55.690 --> 31:57.200
Nice look.

31:58.089 --> 32:00.089
Gunn wants you to meet him here.

32:01.089 --> 32:04.460
- Brentwood?
- I'll watch Bethany. We can shop.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.299
Sure. Sounds like fun.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.019
I'll be back soon.

32:10.690 --> 32:12.759
You're not gonna wear this?

32:14.890 --> 32:18.329
Knock, knock! This works great.
You break, I enter.

32:19.089 --> 32:23.660
- If he's still alive, I can't enter.
- Guy's on the critical list.

32:24.490 --> 32:25.609
You see what I'm seeing?

32:26.890 --> 32:31.390
- Doesn't fit the thug profile.
- No. I hear he was muscle for hire.

32:32.289 --> 32:34.960
- So he was sent.
- Somebody wanted her hurt.

32:35.890 --> 32:37.960
Or wanted to see what would happen.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.589
Look for an address book.
Checks, statements.

32:41.890 --> 32:44.559
I'm still dealing with this
ugly living room.

32:45.490 --> 32:48.509
- Some people shouldn't have money.
- About money...

32:49.089 --> 32:51.690
...how would you feel maybe...

32:52.089 --> 32:54.049
...on a case-by-case basis...?

32:55.690 --> 32:58.289
- Are you offering to pay me?
- Yeah.

32:59.289 --> 33:00.829
Cool.

33:05.289 --> 33:09.470
- You're a very graceful man.
- Someone's off the critical list.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.579
Rapist for hire. You see me crying?

33:24.490 --> 33:27.369
Wolfram & Hart,
How may I direct your call?

33:33.529 --> 33:37.880
- You were right, this is great.
- The vanilla makes it less latte-y.

33:38.329 --> 33:39.099
Yeah.

33:40.130 --> 33:44.450
Where I'm from, they just have coffee.
Everything else is "L.A. stuff."

33:44.930 --> 33:47.420
- Don't bone my boss.
- What?

33:48.529 --> 33:50.390
Angel's strictly a no-bone.

33:50.930 --> 33:54.549
I wasn't-- Cordelia, I don't
wanna sleep with Angel.

33:55.130 --> 33:59.240
The thing about Angel,
he's old-fashioned. Old-fashioned.

34:00.529 --> 34:03.829
Like, the age of chivalry.
He sees you as...

34:04.130 --> 34:05.710
...the damsel in distress.

34:06.529 --> 34:09.268
I think it's more
complicated than that.

34:09.530 --> 34:12.760
- Why are you--?
- I think you're kind of dangerous.

34:14.929 --> 34:19.389
I'm not being mean. I like you.
But you come on all helpless...

34:20.329 --> 34:23.980
...and people who have thought
you were helpless have died.

34:24.530 --> 34:28.320
Those men in the alley....
That was the only....

34:29.929 --> 34:31.230
They were gonna hurt me.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.590
You could have floated them away...

34:34.130 --> 34:37.849
...or spun them until they puked.
You squashed them.

34:43.730 --> 34:45.980
You don't know how scary it was.

34:47.329 --> 34:49.010
Yes, I do.

34:49.130 --> 34:53.099
I had a vision of you.
That's how Angel found you.

34:53.929 --> 34:55.440
I felt everything.

34:56.329 --> 35:00.829
And those guys are better off
squashed, I truly think.

35:01.730 --> 35:04.119
But in that moment,
a decision got made.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.119
I don't want that
to happen to my friends.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.750
Or, and I can't
stress this enough, me.

35:11.329 --> 35:14.349
No matter what,
sex complicates the equation...

35:15.530 --> 35:17.780
...even more than you think.

35:18.530 --> 35:20.000
I get it.

35:20.929 --> 35:24.159
- You don't have to worry.
- Good.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.550
- So are you and Angel--?
- Oh, no.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.730
I like my men less broody
and more spendy.

35:34.130 --> 35:36.900
He is kind of earnest.
He always seems--

35:37.730 --> 35:39.269
What a jerk.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.739
You're about to drop your--

35:41.929 --> 35:44.000
Stop! Police!

35:49.130 --> 35:50.849
Stay with me, stay with me.

35:51.530 --> 35:54.480
Come on! No, Bethany, come on!

35:55.130 --> 35:57.130
Come on! Come on, Bethany!

35:59.329 --> 36:03.050
Bethany! You can squash those guys!

36:03.530 --> 36:04.860
Cordelia!

36:05.929 --> 36:08.280
Tan van! Fetch!

36:22.130 --> 36:23.460
Take the wheel.

36:26.929 --> 36:28.159
Closer!

36:46.130 --> 36:48.340
Shut up! Just shut up!

36:49.130 --> 36:51.550
One more excuse,
and I'll bury you alive...

36:52.130 --> 36:55.360
...next to my house,
so I can hear you screaming.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.059
He took her to the hotel? Great.

37:01.130 --> 37:04.679
He wants to play with
little Miss Time Bomb, let him.

37:05.329 --> 37:06.980
Pull the trigger.

37:07.130 --> 37:09.449
- Bethany.
- No, it's someone else!

37:10.130 --> 37:12.269
I know Lilah.
She's not what you think.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.090
- She's my friend!
- Angel.

37:16.130 --> 37:19.710
It's not her! You're making it up!
You're playing with me!

37:20.329 --> 37:22.539
- I don't want to play!
- Control yourself.

37:22.730 --> 37:24.269
Don't touch me!

37:25.130 --> 37:26.949
Maybe she just needs a time-out.

37:27.530 --> 37:29.599
- Bethany, stop.
- I won't listen.

37:29.929 --> 37:31.369
- You can control this. Listen!
- No!

37:32.329 --> 37:36.050
You have the power here.
You gonna kill us? You gonna die?

37:36.530 --> 37:39.369
Then they win. Don't let them.

37:41.929 --> 37:43.679
Don't let them touch you.

38:02.929 --> 38:04.300
Hello, Rabbit.

38:15.530 --> 38:18.579
- Daddy.
- God, Bethany, I've been so worried.

38:20.329 --> 38:22.329
I couldn't have found you, except....

38:23.329 --> 38:26.519
Your friend Lilah and I
only want to help you.

38:35.929 --> 38:37.820
I know what you can do, Bethany.

38:40.130 --> 38:42.659
I know you don't mean to hurt anyone.

38:43.130 --> 38:45.269
You're a good girl. I know that.

38:46.130 --> 38:47.849
No more worries, all right?

38:49.130 --> 38:52.110
You're coming with me.
We'll be a family again.

38:56.929 --> 38:58.960
Wouldn't you like to stop running?

38:59.329 --> 39:02.099
To come back where
people know you, love you?

39:05.329 --> 39:07.820
It'll be just like it was before.

39:13.130 --> 39:15.380
I've missed you so much.

39:19.130 --> 39:20.880
Shh, Rabbit.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.320
Bethany--

39:30.530 --> 39:32.210
There you go.

39:32.929 --> 39:36.019
Why don't we go downstairs,
just you and me?

39:39.530 --> 39:41.039
What are you doing?

39:41.329 --> 39:43.079
Stop it! Put me down!

39:46.130 --> 39:48.550
I can't breathe.

39:50.329 --> 39:52.539
Help me, please! Stop her!

39:53.329 --> 39:56.590
Bethany, you've got the power.

39:56.929 --> 39:58.369
Use it.

39:59.929 --> 40:02.599
- Finish it.
- It hurts.

40:02.929 --> 40:04.719
Make it stop.

40:07.130 --> 40:08.320
Goodbye.

40:39.769 --> 40:43.880
You think that's it? Poof, you're
cured, the nightmares are gone?

40:44.570 --> 40:48.989
- I'm not an idiot or a child.
- Yes, you are, and you need us.

40:49.969 --> 40:53.800
Your powers will get out of control,
and you'll need a friend.

40:54.769 --> 40:57.650
Friends don't hire men
to rape and kidnap me.

40:58.369 --> 41:00.190
At least not my close ones.

41:01.369 --> 41:04.000
I was trying to make you stronger.

41:09.769 --> 41:11.210
Good job.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.710
Bethany. Bethany, wait.

41:14.570 --> 41:18.150
- You could've been important.
- You gotta learn to lose.

41:18.769 --> 41:20.309
You're not invited in.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.269
Don't try to find me. I mean it.

41:23.570 --> 41:27.260
But our firm doesn't want
to lose-- You're not....

41:28.969 --> 41:31.710
He is a vampire, you know.

41:33.170 --> 41:34.429
Weird.

41:38.570 --> 41:41.760
You'll have to find
someone else's brain to play with.

41:42.170 --> 41:44.269
Yeah, we have someone in mind.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.320
Good night, Lilah.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.000
Sweet dreams.

42:36.010 --> 42:37.829
Thank you, thank you very much,
