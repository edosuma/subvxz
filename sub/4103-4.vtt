Noah:
Prey/ous/y

sc rea m. . .

00:09.310 --> 00:11.062
Hudson:
I knew
lakewooa' had a h/Story.
(sc rea m s)

00:11.070 --> 00:12.606
You just don't expect
lightning to strike twice.

00:12.610 --> 00:13.929
Why didn't you tell me
you were daisy?

00:13.940 --> 00:15.635
Because it happened
a long time ago.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.278
Someone knows.

00:18.080 --> 00:18.876
He called you again?

00:18.880 --> 00:21.815
R/Yey:
Just before noah and i
were about to, you know...

00:21.820 --> 00:23.742
Tyler finally
texted back.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.842
He said he didn't do it.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.010
There is no way
out of this.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.908
So we can help
each other. Or not.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.785
But then it's every
man for himself.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.678
Man: (on phone)
i’m the one
thatis gonna lift the mask.

00:31.690 --> 00:34.750
I am done playing your games,
and i'm done with you.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.399
Where's brooke?
Where the hell is she?

00:37.400 --> 00:40.289
Riley, stay put.
I'm coming.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.192
Help!

00:43.040 --> 00:44.234
(grunting)

00:44.240 --> 00:45.002
(screams)

00:45.010 --> 00:46.329
Woman: (on radio)
suspect ty/er o ’ne/7/.

00:46.340 --> 00:50.504
Vehicle reported crashed
through construction
on kinca/d bridge.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.817
(sobbing) no.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.794
(sobbing)

01:16.570 --> 01:17.867
Emma?

01:17.870 --> 01:20.566
Emma, honey, they got him.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.299
They got tyler.
He crashed his car.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.702
Aw, honey.

01:27.580 --> 01:30.310
I'll be right back.
You stay here, okay?

01:30.320 --> 01:31.947
Okay. Okay.

01:34.990 --> 01:36.651
Is that riley?

01:36.660 --> 01:38.059
Oh, my god.

01:38.260 --> 01:39.750
How did this happen?

01:44.170 --> 01:48.334
Where was he?
She was right here!
Noah! Come on. Breathe.

01:48.340 --> 01:49.261
Noah, stop!

01:49.270 --> 01:51.135
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.903
Who would kill her?

01:52.910 --> 01:55.105
I need to know.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.747
Yeah. So do i.

02:23.070 --> 02:24.560
Hey.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.135
Hey.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.877
Man...

02:29.310 --> 02:30.607
How did this happen?

02:32.350 --> 02:33.703
It's my fault.
It's not.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.119
Look, riley marra was
murdered on my watch.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.111
At my station.
How is that not
my fault?

02:37.120 --> 02:38.940
You couldn't
foresee this.
No one could.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.783
Look, i underestimated
him, maggie.

02:42.020 --> 02:44.488
I let him distract me.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.020
Mom. Who is it?

02:46.030 --> 02:48.294
Emma, you shouldn't
be here. Come on.
Is it tyler?

02:48.300 --> 02:49.619
No. Sweetie.
Is he dead?

02:49.630 --> 02:52.963
The driver
was decapitated
during the crash.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.258
Newsome:
Hey, sheriff.
Yeah.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.904
They found this
near the car.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.740
That's the brandon james mask.

03:14.720 --> 03:19.089
Piper: (over podcast)
honest/y, guys, th/s Is
a tough one to talk about.

03:19.090 --> 03:22.059
I mean, i ’Ve covered
some terr/b/e things,

03:22.060 --> 03:24.221
But last night
i felt it.

03:24.230 --> 03:27.563
The hunt for ty/er o ’ne/i/
ended in tragedy

03:27.570 --> 03:30.198
And another lakewood
teen lost her life.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.509
And the press WIi/ be hyping
the curse of brandon james

03:33.510 --> 03:36.001
And looking for
someone to blame,

03:36.010 --> 03:38.740
But i ’ve met these kids.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.719
Their loss is .
imposs/b/e to descr/be.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.573
So i ’m not gonna try.

03:42.590 --> 03:48.210
My heartfelt condolences go
to the friends and fam/ly
of r/ley marra.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.211
I’m so sorry for your loss.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.221
Could you
turn that off?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.461
(sighs) i can't
believe she's gone.

04:02.470 --> 04:05.132
I can't believe
i abandoned her.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.809
Brooke, we both did.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.605
But you were
worried about me.

04:13.980 --> 04:16.676
And i was answering
a booty call.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.282
To a guy who
didn't even show.

04:18.290 --> 04:21.953
Brooke, it's
not your fault.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.287
(sniffles)

04:25.290 --> 04:29.454
You know, i don't think i'm
gonna make it through
this town hall thing.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.926
(sniffles)

04:30.930 --> 04:35.094
None of this waterproof
mascara actually is.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.729
Come here.

04:37.740 --> 04:41.278
You can go a day
without mascara.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.975
You know, riley had
those insane long lashes.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.277
(chuckles) yeah.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.339
She never had
to wear mascara.

04:54.490 --> 04:55.980
That bitch.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.321
I know.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.720
(sobbing)
i miss her, too.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.568
(door opens)

05:16.810 --> 05:18.072
Hey.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.002
Found you.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.819
Did you sleep
here last night?

05:27.620 --> 05:28.814
Thank you.

05:28.820 --> 05:32.449
If by "sleep," you mean
"stare numbly into space,"

05:32.460 --> 05:35.395
Then, yeah, i slept.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.723
What are you reading?

05:37.730 --> 05:44.135
Uh, highlights from my brief
text relationship with riley.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.799
"meet me by
the football field."

05:46.810 --> 05:48.937
(soft chuckle)
that's a really big one.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.443
Uh, "yes, my mom's
on a kale kick."

05:51.450 --> 05:52.405
That's disgusting.

05:52.410 --> 05:54.002
"who would win in
a cage match,

05:54.020 --> 05:55.373
Lady gaga or madonna?"

05:55.380 --> 05:56.642
Oh, definitely gaga.

05:56.650 --> 05:59.084
Yeah, gaga would
totally win, right?

05:59.090 --> 06:01.012
Kick her ass.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.257
Yeah.

06:06.260 --> 06:07.056
God.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.450
I don't know, the
Victorians had it right.

06:10.470 --> 06:14.395
You know, i wish i had,
like, a lock of her hair,

06:14.970 --> 06:16.665
Or something real.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.206
You know, not just pixels.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.375
You have memories.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.605
You know, maybe if
i'd punched my v-card,

06:25.610 --> 06:27.043
The rules of horror
would've kicked in.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.415
Maybe i'd be
the one who died.

06:28.420 --> 06:31.344
I don't think
that's how it works.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.688
I would offer
to deflower you,

06:35.690 --> 06:37.112
But i'd just be
taking advantage

06:37.130 --> 06:38.279
Of your heightened
emotional state,

06:38.290 --> 06:39.780
And we can't have that.
(scoffs) thank you.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.291
Yeah, that's very
kind of you.
Mmm.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.929
Well, i'd rather
channel my anguish

06:45.930 --> 06:48.160
Into something productive.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.859
Maybe vigilante justice.

06:51.270 --> 06:53.431
Hey, we could team up,

06:53.440 --> 06:56.204
"bi-curi_ou_s and
the Virgin."

06:56.750 --> 07:00.140
That's the world's saddest
crime-fighting duo.

07:00.150 --> 07:01.845
(chuckles)

07:01.850 --> 07:04.273
(both imitate explosion)

07:08.290 --> 07:09.518
Come on, virgin.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.883
We're gonna be late.

07:10.890 --> 07:16.021
No, you go. I'm not ready
to face reality yet.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.731
You see this? Tyler's car.
It's all over the web.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.332
Will: Yeah, and riley.

07:26.340 --> 07:27.238
She shouldn't be dead.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.403
I know. But tyler
and nina are gone.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.409
They can't hurt
us anymore.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.571
They weren't the
ones ready to slam me

07:34.580 --> 07:36.514
With a shovel last night.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.915
It's just you and me.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.345
We gotta trust each other.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.589
How you doing, em?

07:49.930 --> 07:52.694
I've been better.
Yeah.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.998
My dad's got index cards.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.707
How could there be
talking points today?

07:58.710 --> 08:00.803
(feedback blares)

08:01.110 --> 08:02.077
Good morning, my friends.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.901
I know that we're all still
reeling from the events
of the past few days.

08:04.910 --> 08:11.042
And the loss to our community
is something that we will be
feeling for years to come.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.842
Sheriff hudson?

08:15.820 --> 08:19.256
I know there are a lot of,
uh, rumors floating around.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.694
And i'm here to tell
you what we know.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.827
Last night, it appears
that tyler o'neill

08:23.830 --> 08:26.993
Attacked riley marra
outside the sheriff's station

08:27.000 --> 08:28.126
And then fled the scene.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.962
Riley died of her
injuries before
paramedics could arrive.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.437
Now, security
footage shows

08:33.440 --> 08:37.399
That her assailant
was wearing the same
mask as the person

08:37.410 --> 08:38.809
Who killed nina patterson.

08:38.810 --> 08:42.610
And that mask was found in
the wreckage of tyler's car.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.417
Our me is running
forensic tests

08:44.420 --> 08:47.241
To confirm that
the body found
inside that car

08:47.260 --> 08:50.752
Is in fact that
of tyler o'neill's.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.649
But i am confident
we've got our man.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.360
It's over.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.333
(murmuring)

09:08.310 --> 09:09.675
Hey, sheriff.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.305
Yeah?

09:10.310 --> 09:14.303
What about rachel murray?
Did tyler kill her, too?

09:14.850 --> 09:16.078
Afraid i can't
discuss that.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.479
We just opened
our investigation.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.185
But you are
investigating it, right?

09:19.190 --> 09:22.751
You're not just gonna pin it
on tyler to close the case?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.988
No one's pinning
anything on anyone.

09:26.930 --> 09:27.555
Emma,

09:27.560 --> 09:31.690
Maybe you should take your
friend to see one of those
grief counselors.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.165
Hey, audrey.
Come on.
I know.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.268
Audrey.

09:38.270 --> 09:41.330
Look, we're gonna
figure this out,
i promise.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.339
The crazy thing is,
i kind of want it
to be tyler.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.840
_ I know.
I just want it
to be over.

09:45.850 --> 09:49.445
Everyone does.
That's what
i'm worried about.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.711
You think the killer
is still out there.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.359
I don't know.
I hope not.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.727
Even if tyler did
kill riley and nina,

09:58.730 --> 10:02.052
Why would he have been
the one harassing me?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.856
It doesn't make sense.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.526
You're right.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.031
The mayor needs to
open the beaches,

10:09.040 --> 10:10.337
But he wants to be sure
the shark's dead.

10:10.340 --> 10:13.264
Yeah, well, the techs
are still sifting through
the wreckage,

10:13.280 --> 10:15.407
Picking up pieces,
literally.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.332
Maggie, come
on, it's me.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.370
Is this
tyler o'neill?

10:19.880 --> 10:20.403
(sighs)

10:20.420 --> 10:22.274
The hands are too
burned to pull prints.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.943
I started a dna panel,
but the results take time.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.713
Wouldn't dental
records be faster?

10:27.720 --> 10:30.188
If i had something
to compare them to.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.180
What do you mean?

10:31.190 --> 10:35.149
Well, the team has been
dragging the creek all night.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.924
But we can't seem
to find his head.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.604
(door opens)

10:54.750 --> 10:59.414
I'll have a triple
half-sweet 2% caramel
macchlato, please.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.650
That's a joke.
(chuckles)

11:02.060 --> 11:02.719
Yeah.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.780
No, hearing the sheriff
spell out what happened,

11:05.790 --> 11:07.781
I just had to
check on you.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.124
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:09.130 --> 11:12.827
Yeah, i thought that it would
be good to get back to work.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.195
But, um...

11:14.400 --> 11:17.631
Every shot i pour
makes me think of riley.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.467
(chuckles) her insane
espresso tolerance.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.337
Yeah, she could drink any
grad student under the table.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.205
That night we were
cramming for finals,

11:24.210 --> 11:26.599
_ She was
practically levitating.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.042
Yeah.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.985
(sobbing) yeah, she was.

11:43.230 --> 11:44.424
I'm... I'm sorry.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.694
No. No, don't be.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.997
Yeah.

11:51.610 --> 11:55.330
(sniffles) so,
is this what being
friends feels like?

11:55.580 --> 11:58.231
It's, uh, not so
terrible, huh?

12:00.550 --> 12:03.212
No. Not today.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.241
(mouthing)

12:06.250 --> 12:08.559
(phone rings)

12:08.890 --> 12:10.312
I'm sorry.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.623
Hey, brooke.
What's up?

12:12.630 --> 12:13.585
Brooke:
Grieﬁshopp/ng.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.455
I need advice picking
funeral nail polish.

12:16.470 --> 12:17.255
Come help me.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.228
Well, as uplifting as
that sounds, i've, uh,

12:20.240 --> 12:21.366
I've gotta go. I'm at work.

12:21.370 --> 12:25.158
What do you think, em?
Titanium, black onyx?

12:25.170 --> 12:27.434
Both sound equally
depressing to me.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.603
I got to go, i'll call
you later, okay?

12:33.180 --> 12:34.704
(sighs)

12:34.920 --> 12:36.774
Black onyx.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.846
(sighs)

12:38.850 --> 12:40.681
Riley would approve.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.249
(cell phone chimes)

13:02.880 --> 13:04.939
Emma: I heard your
podcast this morning.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.339
Thanks for what
you said about riley.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.842
I can't imagine what you
guys are going through.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.943
Yeah. You don't want to.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.556
Um, the usual?

13:15.560 --> 13:19.018
Uh, no, thank you.
Uh, double shot, to-go.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.158
So, uh...

13:21.160 --> 13:22.752
I heard that the ptb

13:22.760 --> 13:25.820
Is trying to pin
the blame on
your sheriff.

13:25.830 --> 13:28.196
I hope not.
It's not his fault.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.088
Oh, no, of course not.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.305
I mean, it's
tyler's fault.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.899
"lakewood slasher dead."

13:36.210 --> 13:39.270
That's what sells
ad banners on
huffpo, right?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.406
But you don't
think that's true?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.638
I think that people
need it to be tyler,

13:42.650 --> 13:46.746
And i also think
that your sheriff is
not the only person

13:46.760 --> 13:49.320
Who's gonna be
the scapegoat here.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.810
See you later.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.155
Thanks.
Thanks.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.699
Mom?

14:58.030 --> 14:59.429
Dad?

15:13.040 --> 15:13.961
Hey.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.505
Drinking on the job is
a new thing for you.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.238
They can't fire me.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.174
I'm the only one who knows
how to reset the router.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.171
At least take it slow.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.972
Noah?
Emma.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.413
Uh, welcome to
my nightmare.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.853
What's up?

15:28.860 --> 15:30.384
I got this
in the mail.

15:30.390 --> 15:33.223
I think the killer is sending
me some weird message.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.949
A yearbook?
That's not so weird.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.451
Oh, holy manson
family album!

15:38.470 --> 15:39.459
Hey.
Sorry.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.132
Just... These were
brandon's victims.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.129
He stole their faces.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.199
And then he
scratched out my dad's.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.734
The only survivor.

15:46.740 --> 15:48.731
I guess tyler could
have sent this,

15:48.740 --> 15:49.672
But it seems
a little analog

15:49.680 --> 15:52.376
For a killer who's been using
social media and cell cloning.

15:52.380 --> 15:55.349
Well, i mean he is
taking me to the past.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.414
Is this the message?

15:56.420 --> 15:59.218
Yeah. "the truth lies where
the mask was made."

15:59.220 --> 16:00.983
You know, the mask
brandon james wore

16:00.990 --> 16:03.151
Was actually
a surgical mask.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.584
Some say it was all that
held his face together...
Noah.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.251
Okay, okay.
Um, just...

16:08.260 --> 16:11.718
It was to protect
_ his s_utures from
Infection, post-op.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.163
So who made it?
I don't know.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.592
Brandon's surgeries were done
at lakewood general,

16:14.600 --> 16:20.004
Out on the turnpike,
but it closed down, like,
six or seven years ago.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.629
Please_tell me
we're gomg there!

16:23.650 --> 16:25.743
No. We're, we're
not going anywhere.

16:25.750 --> 16:26.978
But it's a great lead!

16:26.980 --> 16:29.369
Look, i know that you want
to do something for riley,

16:29.380 --> 16:31.769
And i do, too.
But, uh...

16:31.790 --> 16:34.008
This could
be a trap.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.758
Uh, yeah, fine. Okay.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.409
Why don't you take
it to the sheriff?

16:38.430 --> 16:40.785
Yeah, go be law-abiding
and whatever.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.325
I've got some
grief-gaming to do.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.469
I'll catch you later.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.393
Emma?

16:50.840 --> 16:53.138
Em, you're going to that
hospital alone, aren't you?

16:53.140 --> 16:56.405
I... Ijust keep
thinking about what
you said this morning.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.243
About what a relief it would
be if it actually was tyler

16:59.250 --> 17:00.444
Who was behind
all of this.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.839
And, i mean, if he sent
me that yearbook,

17:02.850 --> 17:05.273
And he's dead,
then this isn't a trap.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.314
He's not there
to ambush me.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.117
And you'd have
your answer.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.052
Yeah.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.585
But also,
if it wasn't him...

17:11.590 --> 17:13.478
Then we go together.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.625
Prepared.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.423
Okay.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.221
Cool.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.593
Should we take noah?
Oh, god, no.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.295
He'd be like a four-year-old
at disneyland.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.359
We'd have to put
a leash on him.

17:25.370 --> 17:26.837
Fair point.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.076
He can watch
the highlight reel.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.800
Let's go.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.353
(sighs)

17:44.360 --> 17:46.385
What's that about?
That was the city attorney.

17:46.390 --> 17:49.257
Riley marra's family
wants to file a civil case

17:49.260 --> 17:52.718
Against lakewood, naming
me the lead screw-up.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.263
Not the official term.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.267
(sighs)
look, i know
riley's parents.

17:57.270 --> 18:00.501
When the time is right,
i'll try talking to them.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.274
Rachel murray's name
came up today, too.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.100
I delayed
the investigation

18:05.110 --> 18:07.647
To give her family
a clay to mourn,

18:07.650 --> 18:09.641
But now it looks like
i'm covering something up.

18:09.650 --> 18:13.086
That's ridiculous.
You did nothing wrong.

18:14.390 --> 18:15.709
Hey,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.558
I'll back you up.

18:18.130 --> 18:21.258
Yeah. Well, let's hope
that's good enough.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.367
Hey, kitten. You okay?

18:27.370 --> 18:27.893
(sighs)

18:27.900 --> 18:30.892
My friends are dead and
everyone hates me.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.629
Other than that, perfect.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.631
Hey, did you
talk to mom?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.632
I keep trying her cell
and it just goes
straight to voicemail.

18:38.650 --> 18:43.178
Well, i don't think
the ashram allows phones.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.449
(sighs)

18:44.450 --> 18:45.883
Does she_ even know
what's gomg on here?

18:45.890 --> 18:50.509
Brooke, your mom
has perfected
the art of avoidance.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.488
I, on the other hand,
have to handle the press,

18:53.500 --> 18:54.319
The grieving parents,

18:54.330 --> 18:58.699
And a departmental screw-up
of darwin award proportions.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.665
(sighs) i'm sorry.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.968
I know you miss her.
So do i.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.531
But, um, you can
talk to me.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.609
(sighs)

19:10.610 --> 19:14.501
Now, what do you mean
everybody hates you?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.169
You're adorable.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.008
Forget it.

19:21.990 --> 19:23.309
(sighs)

19:27.800 --> 19:30.621
Yo! What's the 9-1-1?

19:30.830 --> 19:32.195
(exhales)

19:32.200 --> 19:32.928
I got into duke.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.933
Hell, yeah!
Huge congrats, bro.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.191
Thanks, man.

19:37.210 --> 19:40.259
Um, but no scholarship.

19:40.580 --> 19:45.176
So, i'm gonna be
paying 63 grand.

19:45.180 --> 19:48.206
Which may as well
be 63 million.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.217
Did you tell your dad?

19:51.250 --> 19:52.615
Not yet.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.555
(sighs) he'll never
co-sign for student loans,

19:55.560 --> 19:56.652
So that's it.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.810
I'm never getting out of here.

19:59.630 --> 20:04.420
You know, if you need
fast cash for tuition,

20:05.430 --> 20:07.193
There is another option.

20:11.870 --> 20:12.632
Blackmail?

20:12.640 --> 20:14.528
We're finally in
the clear and you
want to dive back in?

20:14.540 --> 20:15.700
We are still
in the clear.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.372
This guy has no
idea who we are.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.672
We don't even
have the video.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.648
It's on nina's laptop.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.142
There may be another copy.

20:26.150 --> 20:29.517
(scoffs) i knew you
didn't delete everything.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.748
We have an opportunity.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.388
Look, if the guy balks,
then we walk.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.153
No harm, no foul.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.095
But if he pays,

20:38.170 --> 20:39.728
Hello, duke.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.252
Emma: Okay. So,
what do you think?

21:10.270 --> 21:13.467
Uh, second thoughts
are setting in.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.806
Look, this guy killed riley
at the police station

21:19.810 --> 21:21.539
And nina at her house,
and i know for a fact

21:21.540 --> 21:24.600
That he was outside
my house the other night.

21:24.610 --> 21:27.579
If he wanted to kill me,
he's had plenty of chances.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.445
That's sketchy logic.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.513
But it almost
makes sense.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.585
All right,
let's gear up.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.864
You have a stun gun?

21:45.870 --> 21:48.862
Yeah. Over-protective dad.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.593
If your psycho friend
shows up,

21:50.610 --> 21:52.805
Push the button,
jam it into his junk.

21:52.810 --> 21:55.165
Sounds effective.
What about you?

21:56.040 --> 21:58.577
I'm old school.
Great.

22:02.180 --> 22:04.273
You ready?

22:04.750 --> 22:06.047
Yeah.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.927
After you.

22:13.930 --> 22:15.693
Thanks.
(chuckles)

22:29.940 --> 22:31.874
This place is huge.

22:32.880 --> 22:37.579
Maybe we should split up.
Hey, that is not
even remotely funny.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.943
Just a thought.
It's not funny.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.680
Audrey: Just
messing with you.
This way.

22:41.690 --> 22:43.180
Okay.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.284
Audrey: If tyler did
send you that yearbook,

22:47.300 --> 22:49.256
We're following
a dead man's trail.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.694
Great, or a live
man's trap.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.191
Who's to say a woman
couldn't torture and kill

22:54.200 --> 22:56.168
Just as well as a man?

22:56.840 --> 22:59.866
Well, it was a man's
voice that called me.

22:59.870 --> 23:02.202
(voice masked)
a voice l/ke this?
(gasps)

23:02.210 --> 23:03.802
$1.99 voice-changer app.

23:03.810 --> 23:06.142
We used it for _
rachel's zombie mowe.

23:06.150 --> 23:07.549
Please do not
do that again.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.417
I'm just saying,
it could be anybody.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.689
(sighs)

23:21.730 --> 23:23.152
Emma: God.

23:35.980 --> 23:38.073
Well, this can't be good.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.907
It keeps going.

23:49.960 --> 23:51.518
(metal clangs)

24:07.680 --> 24:09.978
(inhales) he's been here.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.675
What do you wanna do?

24:12.310 --> 24:15.973
I want to find that
son of a bitch.
Me, too.

24:55.290 --> 24:56.689
Oh, god.

25:00.390 --> 25:02.119
(flies buzzing)

25:11.340 --> 25:12.637
Is that a pig?

25:12.640 --> 25:16.098
Oh, god, i'm never
eating bacon again.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.239
The heart's gone.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.269
So's the head.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.010
My mom got
a heart in a box.

25:25.220 --> 25:28.678
This is where
it's from.
Lovely.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.615
Oh...
Help me find a light.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.369
Audrey: Noah was right.

25:51.780 --> 25:53.998
Emma: It's brandon james.

25:54.450 --> 25:58.318
Oh, my god, this must be
where they tried to fix him.

26:41.130 --> 26:43.155
The masks were custom-made
for brandon's face

26:43.160 --> 26:45.253
After each one
of the surgeries.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.192
There's more than one?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.365
Fabulous.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.206
(door thuds)

26:54.710 --> 26:56.177
Look.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.789
(charging)

27:34.220 --> 27:35.676
(grunts)

27:37.320 --> 27:39.515
(groans)

27:40.020 --> 27:41.214
Noah?

27:41.220 --> 27:41.914
What the hell!

27:41.920 --> 27:44.650
Did you just try to
tase my man-parts?

27:44.660 --> 27:46.457
Get up.
(grunts)

27:46.460 --> 27:47.722
What are you
doing here?

27:47.730 --> 27:49.220
Does that really
require an explanation?

27:49.230 --> 27:52.028
You know i wanna make
this guy pay just
as much as you do.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.328
Hey. Don't blame
emma. Blame me.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.537
Guys, we have
bigger problems.

27:57.970 --> 28:00.063
Holy christmas.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.238
Oh, i knew it.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.878
Oh, it's a genuine
killer's lair.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.802
That's a thing?
Oh, please don't
get him started.

28:05.810 --> 28:09.200
A lair is an extension of
the killer's psychosis.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.209
The root cellar in
psycho,

28:10.220 --> 28:12.472
Kevin spacey's
apartment in
seven,

28:12.490 --> 28:13.514
Hannibal lecter's kitchen.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.681
I mean, every fictional
killer has one.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.250
Emma: So he's
been living here?

28:18.730 --> 28:20.357
I highly doubt it.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.220
No, this looks staged.

28:22.230 --> 28:26.724
I mean, you see lairs on tv,
not in real life.

28:26.730 --> 28:27.697
Take
pretty little liars.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.191
They're always chock-full
of bloody clues

28:30.200 --> 28:32.236
And creepy
unrealistic icons.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.002
I mean, seriously,

28:33.010 --> 28:35.535
How would a get her hands
on four victorian dolls

28:35.540 --> 28:38.236
That look just like
the main characters?

28:38.250 --> 28:39.478
Where do you
shop for that?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.698
Evil american
girl doll store?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.119
(scoffs)

28:43.120 --> 28:45.475
I can't believe you two
came here without me.

28:45.490 --> 28:49.244
Yeah, you're right.
After you.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.616
(sighs)

29:08.380 --> 29:10.200
Audrey: This is rachel's.

29:10.210 --> 29:13.304
Emma: Nina's necklace.
Noah: This is
riley's keychain.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.005
Bastard took souvenirs.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.476
Jesus".

29:17.650 --> 29:19.015
Emma.

29:20.150 --> 29:22.789
Noah: The missing
yearbook pictures.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.478
It's you.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.885
And you're the star
of the show.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.024
I think we should go.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.260
Yeah, the charm
is wearing off.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.365
Audrey: Emma,
what are you doing?

29:37.370 --> 29:39.804
Oh, my god,
that's nina's laptop.

29:39.810 --> 29:41.300
Audrey: What?

29:44.480 --> 29:46.869
The police have
been looking for this.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.803
I bet.

29:52.750 --> 29:57.119
Whoa. Folders
for all her friends?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.314
Maybe photos?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.423
Noah: Was she friends
with the mayor?

30:00.430 --> 30:02.227
Principal showalter?

30:02.230 --> 30:03.026
The sheriff.

30:03.030 --> 30:05.897
Nina, what the hell
were you doing?

30:06.230 --> 30:07.663
(beeping)

30:09.170 --> 30:10.990
But i'd need some time.
I got it.

30:11.010 --> 30:11.829
Wait, hold on.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.432
Emma, we gotta take this.
This is evidence.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.702
We should let the
police deal with this.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.837
Because they handled
the riley situation so well.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.501
Emma, there's a file
with your name on it.

30:18.510 --> 30:19.772
Aren't you the least
bit curious?

30:19.780 --> 30:21.099
Ijust feel like
this is all a test.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.270
And when i fail,
people die.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.840
You didn't come
here to do nothing.

30:25.850 --> 30:26.782
(metal clanking)

30:26.790 --> 30:28.087
Hey, guys, _
someone's coming.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.183
Wait, does your camera
have an sd card?

30:30.190 --> 30:31.817
Yeah, hang on.

30:33.390 --> 30:34.948
Okay, come on, come on.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.552
Okay.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.752
Noah: Come on, emma, hurry up.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.499
Audrey: How much longer?
Emma: Ten seconds.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.195
We don't have 10 seconds.
I know. I know. I know.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.738
Uh, perimeter alert. Guys.
It's_ almost there.
Five seconds.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.867
Noah: Hey, seriously,
guys, we gotta go.

30:47.880 --> 30:48.665
(door opening)

30:48.680 --> 30:49.772
Guys, we gotta go.
Are we done?

30:49.780 --> 30:52.101
Audrey: Come on.
Let's go. Hurry up.
Noah: Emma, we gotta go!

30:52.110 --> 30:53.270
Emma: Okay, all right.
We're done.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.943
We got it, we got it,
we got it. Okay, okay.
Okay, let's go.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.084
Wait, guys, what's that?

31:01.090 --> 31:03.558
Noah: Oh, it's brandon's mask.
Audrey: Leave it.
We gotta go!

31:03.560 --> 31:05.619
Emma: There might
be dna on it.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.552
(all screaming)

31:11.370 --> 31:11.995
(panﬁng)

31:12.000 --> 31:14.491
Emma: Oh, my god.
Oh, man, that is wrong!

31:14.500 --> 31:15.319
That is tyler's head!

31:15.340 --> 31:18.195
There's no way
he killed anybody.
Emma: Come on. He's coming.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.962
Crap, we gotta go!

31:20.610 --> 31:22.635
(panﬁng)

31:27.310 --> 31:28.902
(emma grunting)

31:28.920 --> 31:30.672
Emma: Back exit!

31:31.590 --> 31:32.579
Go on!

31:32.590 --> 31:34.217
That side! (screams)

31:34.220 --> 31:35.881
(all screaming)

31:35.890 --> 31:38.017
You three, with me. Now.

31:38.030 --> 31:38.815
(siren wailing)

31:38.830 --> 31:41.048
What were
you thinking?
Yeah, what were you thinking?

31:41.060 --> 31:43.358
Every piece of evidence
in that hospital

31:43.360 --> 31:45.555
Is potentially inadmissible
because of you!

31:45.570 --> 31:47.424
How did you know
we were there?

31:47.430 --> 31:49.068
Anonymous tip.

31:49.270 --> 31:50.669
Someone saw you
guys breaking in.

31:50.670 --> 31:53.798
We swept that place a week
ago, looking for tyler.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.539
There was nothing.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.898
So why were you there?

32:03.380 --> 32:06.349
A package came
to the house.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.609
The 1994 lancers yearbook.

32:08.620 --> 32:12.056
He cut out people's faces,
he wrote things.

32:12.060 --> 32:12.924
Oh, my god, emma.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.454
Why didn't you
come straight here?

32:14.460 --> 32:15.757
Because the last
time i came here,

32:15.760 --> 32:17.990
It didn't really
end that well.

32:19.030 --> 32:20.019
Hey, that's not fair.

32:20.030 --> 32:22.123
Mom, none
of this is fair.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.539
Why didn't you tell
me about this?

32:23.540 --> 32:27.032
To try and stop more
people from dying.

32:27.310 --> 32:29.460
I said i didn't
think it was tyler.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.674
No one believed me.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.635
But you believe us now, right?

32:31.650 --> 32:34.699
Well, considering his
head is in that hospital

32:34.720 --> 32:36.745
And his body is in the car,

32:37.720 --> 32:38.709
Yeah.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.573
Glad we cleared that up.

32:39.590 --> 32:43.583
Sit down. Don't move.
I'm gonna need
your camera, audrey.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.353
Now all of you,
get out of here.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.679
Go home. Do me a favor.

32:46.690 --> 32:50.820
Any further contact,
you call me immediately.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.328
Let's go.
Get out of here.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.909
Hey, sweetheart.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.473
This just came for you.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.219
It's from your mother.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.610
I don't need another
tchotchke from india.

33:16.990 --> 33:19.083
Well, you're in luck,

33:19.090 --> 33:22.287
Cause this is
from sri lanka.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.599
Thought that buddhist
retreat was last year.

33:25.800 --> 33:26.960
I thought it didn't take.

33:26.970 --> 33:30.758
Well, apparently,
she's changed her mind.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.401
I don't know.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.571
I have a bad feeling.

33:39.850 --> 33:42.876
Which is perfectly
understandable.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.747
You just lost one of
your best friends.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.856
Such a sweet kid.
(sighs)

33:50.890 --> 33:53.654
Yeah, she really was.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.054
Unlike me.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.656
(sighs)

34:00.730 --> 34:02.527
You're tough, brooke.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.492
So am i.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.159
Doesn't always
make you popular.

34:06.170 --> 34:09.606
But it does make you...
(cell phone chimes)

34:11.250 --> 34:13.241
(sighs) ...Survivors.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.972
(scoffs) you really
don't get it, do you?

34:18.990 --> 34:22.289
Brooke. Brooke, i...
(cell phone chimes)

34:22.290 --> 34:23.757
(sighs)

34:54.290 --> 34:55.609
Brooke?

34:56.460 --> 34:59.679
(sighs) i got your text.
What's up?

35:01.400 --> 35:03.254
Everyone hates me.

35:03.630 --> 35:04.449
You saw the poll?

35:04.470 --> 35:06.961
(scoffs) did you vote
for me, too?

35:06.970 --> 35:08.096
Hell, no.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.489
I gotta keep
you around.

35:11.210 --> 35:16.204
Gotta have one unattainable
hottie to keep me grounded.

35:17.710 --> 35:20.372
Especially with riley
being gone.

35:22.850 --> 35:25.273
Last night,
i left my friend alone

35:25.290 --> 35:29.852
Because i just wanted
what i wanted.

35:30.060 --> 35:32.312
It's always
all about me.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.479
Or your girlish charm.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.229
No, it's not.

35:38.530 --> 35:41.294
I don't wanna
be that person.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.034
Come here.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.136
(sighs)

35:50.740 --> 35:52.207
Thank you.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.386
Noah: Withholding from the
police. Naughty, naughty.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.721
You know me.
(chuckles)

36:10.730 --> 36:13.096
Noah: Let's see
what we got here.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.100
Oh, crap, we ejected
the card too soon.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.829
There's no content.

36:20.170 --> 36:22.536
Wait, hold on.
Hold on, we got one.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.734
Now we just
need a password.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.607
What's something
nina would use?
Try "thunderbitch."

36:26.610 --> 36:27.975
Okay.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.974
Too obvious.
I can get around it.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.141
That was just
an amuse-bouche.

36:46.170 --> 36:48.764
Hey, piper.
Do you have a second?

36:48.770 --> 36:50.328
Emma. Perfect timing.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.968
I was just
wrapping things up.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.130
Wait, you're done?
You're leaving?

36:54.140 --> 36:56.108
I'm gonna grab some
man-on-the-street
reaction bits,

36:56.110 --> 36:58.772
Uh, request interviews from
police, get shut down,

36:58.780 --> 37:00.372
Rinse, repeat.
But, uh, yeah,

37:00.380 --> 37:02.109
The case is
pretty much done.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.076
Just came by to say
goodbye and, uh,

37:04.080 --> 37:05.616
Grab a late
for the road.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.588
Maybe you shouldn't.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.409
You know what, i know,

37:08.420 --> 37:09.614
I've been trying
to cut down,

37:09.620 --> 37:10.985
But you know what,
everybody has their vices...

37:10.990 --> 37:13.185
I'm not talking
about coffee.

37:15.330 --> 37:17.594
Okay. Does this
have anything to do

37:17.600 --> 37:20.364
With what happened
at the hospital yesterday?

37:20.370 --> 37:22.861
The sheriff isn't
sharing anything.

37:22.870 --> 37:25.839
You know, i can't
talk about specifics.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.035
I get it. You don't
have to say anything,

37:28.040 --> 37:31.669
But barista
to podcaster,

37:31.680 --> 37:35.400
If you were me,
would you stay

37:35.680 --> 37:37.341
Or would you go?

37:38.620 --> 37:40.178
I would stay.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.865
Oh, yeah.
You almost make
this look cool.

37:56.870 --> 37:59.759
Yeah, well, we're cooking.
We are cooking with gas.

37:59.770 --> 38:01.408
And there it went.

38:05.250 --> 38:05.875
We're in.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.939
You are jedi.
What is it?

38:07.950 --> 38:10.339
Uh, looks like
a video file.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.982
Oh, my god.
It's emma and will!

38:16.990 --> 38:18.082
Whoa.
Turn it off.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.682
Now, noah. Turn it off!
Yeah, yeah!

38:19.690 --> 38:21.248
Yeah, i'm trying.
I'm trying.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.228
Uploading?
Uploading where?

38:23.230 --> 38:25.027
Uh, it's a hidden executable.
I can't stop it!

38:25.030 --> 38:28.693
The file's just been
shared with the listserv.
What listserv?

38:28.700 --> 38:30.668
(phones beeping)

38:35.880 --> 38:37.006
Here you go.

38:37.010 --> 38:37.704
Thank you.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.928
While i'm still here, you're
gonna have to teach me

38:39.950 --> 38:42.510
How to do that foam,
squiggly-leaf thing.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.714
(phone beeps)

38:43.720 --> 38:45.176
Sure.

38:46.690 --> 38:48.248
(phones beeping)

38:57.500 --> 38:59.354
(indistinct murmurs)

38:59.930 --> 39:01.420
(gasps)

39:01.440 --> 39:03.067
(indistinct)

39:04.100 --> 39:05.795
Emma, what is it?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.204
You okay?

39:07.210 --> 39:08.905
Oh, my god.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.102
What?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.939
It's my first time.
