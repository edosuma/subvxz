00:38.872 --> 00:40.456
<i>I'm sexy, I'm cute</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.166
<i>I'm popular to boot</i>

00:42.167 --> 00:44.043
<i>I'm bitching, great hair</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:45.795
<i>The boys all love to stare</i>

00:45.796 --> 00:47.505
<i>I'm wanted, I'm hot</i>

00:47.506 --> 00:49.215
<i>I'm everything you're not</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:51.050
<i>I'm pretty, I'm cool</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.718
<i>I dominate this school</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.470
<i>Who am I? Just guess</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.180
<i>Guys wanna touch my chest</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:58.015
<i>I'm rocking, I smile</i>

00:58.016 --> 00:59.809
<i>And many think I'm vile</i>

00:59.810 --> 01:01.477
<i>I'm flying, I jump</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:03.479
<i>You can look but
don't you hump, whoo</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.022
<i>I'm major, I roar</i>

01:05.022 --> 01:06.816
<i>I swear I'm not a whore</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:08.568
<i>We cheer and we lead</i>

01:08.569 --> 01:10.570
<i>We act like we're on speed</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:12.154
<i>Hate us 'cause we're beautiful</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:13.614
<i>Well, we don't like you either</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:14.824
<i>We're cheerleaders</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:16.993
<i>We are cheerleaders, uh-huh</i>

01:16.994 --> 01:18.661
<i>Call me Big Red</i>

01:18.662 --> 01:20.580
<i>I'm Wh-Wh- Whitney</i>

01:20.581 --> 01:22.498
<i>C-C-C-Courtney</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:24.041
<i>Dude, it's Darcy</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:25.876
<i>I'm Big Bad Carver, yeah</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:27.837
<i>Just call me Kasey</i>

01:27.838 --> 01:30.587
<i>I'm still Big Red</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:33.301
<i>I sizzle, I scorch</i>

01:33.302 --> 01:35.011
<i>But now I pass the torch</i>

01:35.012 --> 01:36.721
<i>The ballots are in</i>

01:36.722 --> 01:38.514
<i>And one girl had to win</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.266
<i>She's perky, she's fun</i>

01:40.267 --> 01:41.642
<i>And now she's number one</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.227
<i>K-K-Kick it, Torrance</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:45.055
<i>T- T- T- Torrance</i>

01:56.825 --> 01:58.701
<i>I'm strong and I'm loud</i>

01:58.702 --> 02:00.036
<i>I'm gonna make you proud</i>

02:00.037 --> 02:01.746
<i>I'm T- T-T- Torrance</i>

02:01.747 --> 02:03.745
<i>Your captain Torrance</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:06.956
<i>Let's go, Toros</i>

02:07.878 --> 02:09.377
<i>We are the Toros</i>

02:09.378 --> 02:11.380
<i>The mighty, mighty Toros</i>

02:11.381 --> 02:12.840
<i>We're so terrific</i>

02:12.841 --> 02:15.092
<i>We must be Toros</i>

02:15.093 --> 02:17.011
- Yeah!
- Go, Toros!

02:17.012 --> 02:20.640
Yeah, come on! Yeah! All right!

02:24.978 --> 02:26.725
Oh, my God!

02:27.397 --> 02:28.981
- Nice rack!
- Huh?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.566
Oh, baby!

02:31.693 --> 02:33.277
Serves her right!

02:33.278 --> 02:35.446
Check out the hooters!

02:47.709 --> 02:49.126
Holy shit.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.810
Hey, hey, Mr. and Mrs. S.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.019
Oh, look, it's Aaron.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.893
Oh! Hello, Aaron.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.398
Hey, can I help?

03:10.399 --> 03:13.150
Oh, no. We're fine, thanks.
Really. Stay in your vehicle.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.228
You sure?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.863
Bye! Be back later!

03:17.864 --> 03:18.948
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.492
Hi.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.329
Come on, Tor.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.249
Can't mack on you
in front of the parentals.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.667
Bye-bye!

03:37.092 --> 03:39.677
Remember, he's leaving for college.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.970
Right.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.390
So, are you excited?

03:44.391 --> 03:45.599
Oh, yeah!

03:45.600 --> 03:49.353
It's college, Tor. I'm
really stoked, you know?

03:49.354 --> 03:53.566
It's just, you know,
I'm gonna miss you.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.025
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.028
But next year, it'll
be you and me reunited

03:58.029 --> 04:01.031
at Cal State Dominguez Hills.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.825
I'll be the experienced sophomore,

04:02.826 --> 04:05.536
you'll be the hot, new freshman.

04:05.537 --> 04:09.367
Yup. It'll be just like
high school, only better.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.333
Dorm rooms.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.660
Hmm.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.183
I got the door, Tor.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.267
Okay.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.852
I got the door, Tor.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.020
All right.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.223
- What's up, Aaron?
- Hey, what up, Grady?

04:34.024 --> 04:35.524
- Hey!
- Yeah!

04:35.525 --> 04:39.403
Hey, hey, remember, when you get
captain, act surprised, okay?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.696
Don't jinx me.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.781
Hi, Torrance.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.199
Hey, Aaron.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.700
Ah, ladies.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.826
Good luck at school.

04:45.827 --> 04:46.869
Thank you.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.663
Oh, Aaron, come to
one last practice?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.707
You know you're still my
favorite cheerleader.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.833
- Aw!
- Please?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.877
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta run.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.212
You're not staying for the vote?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.546
Hey, I really gotta beat traffic.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.215
I can't be late for orientation.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.418
- But I really want...
- Hey. Hey.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.297
Mmm. Trust me. You're gonna get it.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.307
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.898
- Did you vote?
- Oh, yeah.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.609
Darcy thinks she should get captain
'cause her dad pays for everything.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.402
He should use some of that
money to buy her a clue.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.487
Oh!

05:22.906 --> 05:24.198
Courtney'll get captain.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.075
The guys love clutching her butt.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.827
Yeah, she's got
a lot to hang on to.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.328
What's plural for "butt"?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.788
On one person, I mean.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.249
She puts the "ass" in "massive."

05:33.250 --> 05:35.292
You put the "lude" in "deluded."

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
Yo! Can I have all your votes?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.831
- Mine.
- Here's me.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.303
Thank you.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.931
We should get Big Red a gift, or at
least someone should say something.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.599
- Pass.
- Good riddance.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.684
I don't believe in osmosis.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.977
It's not brown-nosing.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.436
She's the departing captain.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
She did a lot for this squad.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.275
Oh, come on. Both of you sucked
before she whipped you into shape.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.443
Oh, whipped? Is that what that was?

06:01.444 --> 06:04.446
No one will miss Big Red, Tor.
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."

06:04.447 --> 06:07.032
She puts the "whore"
in "horrifying."

06:07.033 --> 06:09.326
You know, it's her last practice.
How would you feel?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.161
Big Red has no feelings.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.909
Just testicles.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.293
You guys are all great athletes.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.210
Thanks in large part to me.

06:20.922 --> 06:25.127
And I know that your new captain
will keep the tradition alive.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.137
Leading you to the
record sixth national

06:28.138 --> 06:31.432
cheerleading championship,
you know is yours.

06:31.433 --> 06:36.395
So, let's meet your new
leader, Torrance Shipman.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.940
Oh, my God!

06:39.608 --> 06:42.277
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

06:42.736 --> 06:43.944
That slut.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.447
Okay, Listen up!
I'd like to try a Wolf Wall.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.282
- Oh, excellent!
- Okay, yeah! We're all going to die.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.117
Torrance has got the fever, people.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.702
What's a Wolf's Wall?

06:51.703 --> 06:54.663
Only the hardest pyramid known
to cheerleading and mankind.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.874
The words "big" and
"britches" come to mind.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.084
She's crazy. She'll kill us all.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.296
Hello! Some of us have not spent
the entire summer working out.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.505
Right, Carver?

07:03.506 --> 07:06.342
Come on, guys!
Let's be different for once.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.927
We can't just rest on our laurels.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.219
Why does everybody say that?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.096
Maybe a laurel's
a good place to rest.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.597
Come on, man. You guys
suck. Let's do this.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.813
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.192
Five, six, seven, eight! Kick one.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.152
Carver!

07:25.153 --> 07:28.238
Five, six, seven, eight!
And one! Stick it!

07:28.239 --> 07:29.698
Come on, girls! Stick it for me!

07:30.951 --> 07:32.618
Five, six, seven, eight!

07:32.619 --> 07:37.120
Go one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Kick one!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.124
Good job! Whoo!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.876
Pinch some panties.
Someone's slacking.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.044
Do I look like a milkmaid?

07:42.045 --> 07:44.046
'Cause somebody feels like a cow!

07:44.047 --> 07:45.631
Carver, can you cradle out?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.379
You bet I can.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.636
Okay, ready? One, two, down, up!

07:50.637 --> 07:52.179
Carver!

07:59.229 --> 08:00.646
Carver!

08:01.022 --> 08:02.398
Are you okay?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.316
I'm fine, really.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.152
Don't you guys worry about me.
It's just a scratch.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.862
I'll be back to practice tomorrow,

08:08.863 --> 08:11.198
so don't you guys fret, okay?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.910
And I don't want you to worry at
all, because I'm a quick healer.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.371
I promise, you guys.
I'm gonna be there for you.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.580
You hear me?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.582
Guys?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.376
Bye!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.216
I got captain.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.177
Yeah, and you sent a girl to the
hospital on your first day.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.595
Aye, aye, Captain!

08:33.596 --> 08:36.265
You were listening
on the phone? Mom!

08:36.265 --> 08:37.433
It's true.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.102
She really should get her
own private line, you know.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.304
She's growing up so fast.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.732
Justin, go away.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.061
- At ease, Captain.
- Oh, shut up.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.989
Well, this blistering academic
schedule shouldn't get in your way.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.824
You should be happy about that.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.452
Why can't you accept the
fact that I'm not a genius?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.662
It just kills you that I'm
not an honor student.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.749
No. It kills me that you
barely make time to study.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.960
If you studied half as much as you
cheer, you'd be in great shape.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.045
Your priorities are...

09:06.046 --> 09:09.298
No! Those are your priorities!
Mine are just fine.

09:09.299 --> 09:13.302
Look, I'm just saying that
college might be less of a shock

09:13.303 --> 09:17.599
if you take an extra lab or
language course or something.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.224
What do you think?

09:19.225 --> 09:21.393
Will Advanced Chem
get you off my back?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.847
Not completely, but it'll help.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.189
Done.

09:25.607 --> 09:30.277
You know, mothers have killed to
get their daughters on squads.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.152
That mother didn't kill anyone.
She hired a hit man.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.543
Hmm.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.045
Everyone, we have a new student

09:48.046 --> 09:51.548
transferring from Mission Hills
High School in Los Angeles.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.377
Please welcome Cliff Pant-One.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.970
Pantone.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.221
Thanks.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.020
Loser!

10:10.360 --> 10:11.860
Loser!

10:14.697 --> 10:17.157
Wait, wait, wait. Was that, uh...

10:17.158 --> 10:19.785
Was that the "loser sneeze"
I just heard right there?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.488
Guys, come on.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.622
I mean, what is that,
from like the 1900s?

10:23.623 --> 10:27.084
Nobody does that anymore.
I don't think anybody does.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.544
When I lived in Kentucky...

10:28.545 --> 10:30.963
Did they still do the
loser sneeze in Kentucky?

10:30.964 --> 10:34.049
No. They had, uh,
guns and homemade bombs.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.175
What about LA?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.886
There was a lot of attitude
in LA, but no loser sneeze.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.056
I'm pretty sure the loser
sneeze is officially dead.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.429
Sorry.

10:44.853 --> 10:45.894
Loser!

10:47.564 --> 10:48.890
Nice.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.737
I don't think they got the
memo about the loser sneeze.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.777
Uh, no, apparently not.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.233
Cliff.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.947
Torrance.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.912
Advanced Chem. Yikes.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.115
Um, afraid so.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.917
Are you intimidated?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.961
Yeah, a little.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.039
- Really?
- No, not really.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.547
So, is that your band or something?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.430
The Clash? No, uh...

11:21.431 --> 11:26.518
It's a British punk band,
circa 1977 to 1983-ish.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.187
Original lineup, anyway.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.810
How vintage.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.990
Um, so I'll see you around then?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.817
Looks like it.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.828
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:44.829 --> 11:49.458
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie and Jan,
Jan, the cheerleading man.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.959
Hey, fags.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.295
Whoa, whoa. Just because we won
more trophies than you guys,

11:53.296 --> 11:55.797
that's no reason
to go get all malignant.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.132
Malignant this, tool.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.302
- Nice.
- Oh, right on!

12:00.303 --> 12:01.762
One of these days, man.

12:01.763 --> 12:02.971
Let it go.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.890
They never even won a single game.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.100
It's gotta be kinda rough on them.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.644
- Besides, they're dicks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.021
Les, tell me you have
Advanced Chem first period.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.481
Advanced Chem, first period.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.316
If you have a lab partner
already, I'm screwed.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.318
Torrance, it's only
the second day of school,

12:16.319 --> 12:19.238
and your academic insecurity
bit is completely tired.

12:21.282 --> 12:25.077
You know, everyone's saying your
ambition broke Carver's leg.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.163
When, really, it was the angle at
which she slammed into the ground.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.832
Kasey did a massive e-mail last
night. Misspelled "leg."

12:30.833 --> 12:31.959
Shut up!

12:31.960 --> 12:33.412
Two G's.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.838
Apparently, Carver gets home
schooling for the next three months.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.507
I'm cursed.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.550
Replacing her is gonna
be a nightmare.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.721
Well, that's why you're
the captain, Captain.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.015
Bring on the tyros, the
neophytes and the dilettanti.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.850
SAT's are over, Darcy.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.894
And you're still
jealous of my score.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.646
Are we sure Carver's
not malingering?

12:52.647 --> 12:55.857
Carver will strictly be cheering
in Special Olympics until March.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.401
Nationals are February 10th.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.361
Regionals are in, like, four weeks.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.654
I talked to her.
She's cool with this.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.114
Don't tell me Carver can cut school

13:02.115 --> 13:04.157
just because she broke
her leg in three places.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.034
Hello! Get a wheelchair!

13:06.035 --> 13:07.327
That lucky bitch.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.746
Tell me we're not actually
continuing this masquerade

13:09.747 --> 13:10.872
and having tryouts.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.709
Let's cut the crap
and pick somebody now.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.128
Whitney's little sister
Jamie is really teeny.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.713
She'll be easy to toss,
and she doesn't give lip.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.797
Just tongue.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.090
Oh, kiss my ass, Jan.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.216
I'd love to.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.093
If she's the best, Jamie's got it.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.137
But we have to see everyone.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.888
Ready, okay!

13:26.889 --> 13:28.807
Wait. Hold on.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.600
Let me try that again.
That was terrible.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.519
Ready, okay!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.097
Go, team...

13:36.065 --> 13:37.642
Ready, okay!

13:38.151 --> 13:39.234
Sorry.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.857
Ready, okay!

13:41.696 --> 13:42.897
Shit.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.823
Be aggressive.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.617
Be, be aggressive.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.744
How many cheers do we
actually have to memorize?

13:48.745 --> 13:49.911
Do we get paid for this?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.913
Oh, and do I have to
provide my own uniform?

13:59.297 --> 14:01.131
And I see you guys are wearing red.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.633
Um, that just does not work for me.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.757
Ready, okay!

14:05.970 --> 14:07.763
R-C-H!

14:08.848 --> 14:10.766
Toros all the way!

14:12.435 --> 14:15.559
I'm sorry. I just broke
up with my boyfriend.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.982
Pretty good.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.077
<i>Yo, yo, yo! What's up? What's up?</i>

14:30.078 --> 14:32.037
<i>It's time to get busy!</i>

14:32.038 --> 14:33.789
<i>So let's kick this shit</i>

14:33.790 --> 14:37.210
<i>And rock the CK
off your panties, yeah</i>

14:38.252 --> 14:41.421
<i>Give my regards to Broadway</i>

14:41.422 --> 14:44.591
<i>Remember me to Herald Square</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:45.675
<i>Tell all the gang...</i>

14:45.676 --> 14:47.219
Excuse me!

14:48.137 --> 14:50.465
What's with the song?

14:50.973 --> 14:53.972
Isn't this the audition
for <i>Pippin?</i>

14:54.268 --> 14:55.352
No.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.146
<i>Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise</i>

14:58.147 --> 15:00.774
<i>Tastes so good
make a grown man cry</i>

15:00.775 --> 15:03.610
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:09.775
<i>Whoo!</i>

15:10.785 --> 15:12.032
Hi.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.457
<i>Well, swinging on the front
porch Swinging on the lawn</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:20.377
<i>Swinging where we want
'cause there ain't nobody home</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:23.755
Okay, uh, any more questions?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.708
I think we're good.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.044
- Here's our girl.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.885
<i>Rancho Carne's not all talk</i>

15:31.514 --> 15:33.716
<i>All we know is Toros rock</i>

15:34.851 --> 15:37.554
<i>Shake your booties
Scream and shout</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:41.106
<i>Toro players work it out</i>

15:41.899 --> 15:43.442
Go, Toros!

15:50.741 --> 15:52.701
And do I really have to wear
those little underwear things?

15:52.702 --> 15:54.619
'Cause I don't like
wearing underwear.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.704
Thanks!

16:08.217 --> 16:10.051
Excuse me. Where'd you
park your Harley?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.554
Get real.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.974
Tattoos are strictly verboten.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.556
Sorry.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.362
I got bored during fourth period.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.941
You need to fill one of these out.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.491
Did it.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.625
Missy, is it?

16:41.626 --> 16:44.544
Okay, before we start, I'm afraid
we're gonna need to make sure

16:44.545 --> 16:46.922
you can do a standing back tuck.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.546
Standard procedure, you understand.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.879
Standing back handspring
back tuck, okay?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.647
Where's this girl from, Romania?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.648
Can she yell?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.442
We'll try an oldie.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.111
<i>Awesome, oh, wow!
Like, totally freak me out!</i>

17:10.112 --> 17:11.988
<i>- I mean, right on
- I mean, right on</i>

17:11.989 --> 17:14.317
<i>The Toros sure are number one</i>

17:16.117 --> 17:17.702
<i>I transferred from Los Angeles</i>

17:17.703 --> 17:19.371
<i>Your school has no gymnastics team</i>

17:19.372 --> 17:21.449
<i>This is a last resort</i>

17:24.502 --> 17:27.253
Okay, so I've never
cheered before. So what?

17:27.255 --> 17:29.297
How about something that
actually requires neurons?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.340
Do it.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.133
Front handspring,
step out, round off,

17:32.134 --> 17:33.843
back handspring,
step out, round off,

17:33.844 --> 17:36.672
back handspring,
full twisting lay out.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.998
Hey!

18:03.666 --> 18:04.874
Missy is bank.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.209
Uh, bankrupt.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.003
We've already so decided on Jamie.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.129
Yeah.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.840
Courtney, this is not a democracy.
It's a "cheerocracy."

18:11.841 --> 18:14.175
I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.554
You are being a "cheertator,"
Torrance, and a pain in my ass!

18:17.555 --> 18:19.382
We already voted.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.809
Besides, Missy looks
like an uber dyke.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.110
Courtney, I'm the captain.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.322
I'm pulling rank, and you
can fall in line or not.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.033
If we're gonna be the best,
we have to have the best.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.783
Missy's the poo.
So take a big whiff.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.051
You.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.469
And you.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.054
I mean, hi. I'm...

18:59.055 --> 19:00.848
A cheerleader.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.264
Uh, yeah. Head
cheerleader, to be exact.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.019
Wow.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.479
So, does Missy live here?

19:07.480 --> 19:10.440
Uh, actually, she moved
back to LA, yeah.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.817
Something about
evil cheerleaders or...

19:12.818 --> 19:15.612
Look, I'm serious.
We have to get her.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.238
Is her drug dependency
gonna be a problem?

19:17.239 --> 19:20.659
Cliff, shut up. What do you want?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.783
I want you on the squad.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.413
You're the best. They know it.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.332
They just reject the unfamiliar.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.000
Thanks, but, no, thanks.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.586
I mean, I plead temporary insanity.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.088
See, I'm a hard-core gymnast.

19:33.089 --> 19:37.050
No way jumping up and down, screaming,
"Go, team, go!" is gonna satisfy me.

19:37.051 --> 19:40.972
Look, we're gymnasts, too, except
no beam, no bars, no vault.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.466
Sorry. Not interested.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.642
What are you doing?

19:45.643 --> 19:48.853
Nothing, I just thought
that it was interesting

19:48.854 --> 19:51.022
hearing Torrance's point of view.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.482
How do you even know her?

19:52.483 --> 19:54.356
We're old friends.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.529
Ever been to a
cheerleading competition?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.280
Oh, you mean like a football game?

19:59.281 --> 20:00.865
No, not a game.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.742
Those are like practices for us.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.953
I'm talking about a tournament.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.788
ESPN cameras all around,

20:06.789 --> 20:08.790
hundreds of people
in the crowds cheering.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.995
Wait, people cheering cheerleaders?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.706
That's right. Lots of people.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.588
Here's the deal, Missy.
We're the shit. The best.

20:18.676 --> 20:19.968
We have fun, we work hard,

20:19.969 --> 20:22.470
and we win national championships.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.682
I'm offering you a chance
to be a part of that.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.435
Think about it, Miss. I mean,
you get to wear sassy outfits.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.606
You get to yell like you
care about something.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.775
She's not the cheering type.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.854
You know what?

20:39.405 --> 20:41.027
Count me in.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.032
Ready, girls?

20:46.787 --> 20:51.124
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

20:51.125 --> 20:54.419
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>

20:54.420 --> 20:57.756
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

20:57.757 --> 21:00.842
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>

21:00.843 --> 21:04.387
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

21:04.388 --> 21:06.848
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

21:06.849 --> 21:07.932
Here we go, girls.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.027
Hey, practice isn't over yet.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.071
Nice recruit, Torrance.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.200
A real captain would've seen
what I saw, a big dykey loser.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.403
I'd say that's strike two.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.669
What the hell is up?

21:36.670 --> 21:38.755
I went out on a limb for
you, and you just bail?

21:38.756 --> 21:39.923
I'm not about stealing.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.257
What are you talking about?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.051
You ripped off those cheers.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.346
Listen, Missy, our cheers
are 100% original.

21:46.347 --> 21:47.722
Count the trophies.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.140
Well, your trophies are bullshit,

21:49.141 --> 21:50.809
because you're a sad-ass liar.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.227
All right, that's it!
Get out of the car!

21:52.228 --> 21:54.395
I'm gonna kick your ass!

21:54.396 --> 21:55.939
Oh, really?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.769
Come on.

22:01.070 --> 22:04.239
You're in for a rude
awakening. Get in.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.942
What? No way.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.611
For real. Get in.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.316
Do your thing, Isis!

22:43.654 --> 22:48.234
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

22:48.450 --> 22:51.452
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>

22:51.453 --> 22:55.206
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>

22:55.207 --> 22:58.167
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>

22:58.168 --> 23:01.754
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

23:01.755 --> 23:02.964
<i>Slow it down</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:06.426
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>

23:06.427 --> 23:07.510
Here we go

23:48.510 --> 23:49.757
Hey!

23:50.512 --> 23:51.846
You guys enjoy the show?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.724
Yes, were the ethnic festivities
to your liking today?

23:54.725 --> 23:56.017
You guys are awesome.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.394
Really? You're ready
to share those trophies?

23:58.395 --> 24:01.356
Can we just beat these buffys
down so I can go home?

24:01.357 --> 24:02.899
I'm on curfew, girl.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.692
Look, there's no need for that.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.027
Oh, you know what? She's right.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.654
See, then we'd be
doing them a favor.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.614
See, then they could feel good
about sending Raggedy Ann up here

24:09.615 --> 24:10.907
to jack us for our cheers.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.033
Raggedy Ann?

24:12.034 --> 24:14.911
Ugly redhead with a video camera
permanently attached to her hand.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.163
Y'all have been coming up here for
years, trying to steal our routines.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.791
And we just love
seeing them on ESPN.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.875
What are you talking about?

24:20.876 --> 24:22.001
"Brrr, it's cold in here.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.212
"I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere?"

24:24.213 --> 24:26.214
I know you didn't think a
white girl made that shit up.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.382
I...

24:27.383 --> 24:29.050
Our free cheer service
is over as of this moment.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.718
- Over!
<i>- Finito!</i>

24:30.719 --> 24:33.388
God, it's like, every time we get some,
here y'all come, trying to steal it,

24:33.389 --> 24:36.557
putting blonde hair on it and
calling it something different.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.059
We've had the best squad
around for years,

24:38.060 --> 24:39.894
but no one's been able
to see what we can do.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.313
Oh, but you better believe all
that's gonna change this year.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.733
I'm captain, and I guarantee you
we'll make it to Nationals.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.736
So, just hand over the tape you made
tonight and we'll call it even for now.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.029
We don't have any tape.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.739
Really. We just came
to see the show.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.944
What? Come on, Isis.
Let me do this.

24:55.285 --> 24:58.864
You know what? Let's go.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.617
Wait a minute. So that's it?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.459
We're just gonna let them go?

25:03.460 --> 25:07.631
Yeah, because unlike
them, we have class.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.709
I swear I had no idea.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.632
Well, now you do.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.058
You been touched by an angel, girl.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.268
Jenelope, let's go.

25:20.269 --> 25:24.190
I can't believe those white
girls just came up here...

25:27.443 --> 25:30.570
We just so almost got our
asses kicked back there!

25:30.571 --> 25:32.488
I mean, I knew I'd seen
those routines before.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.488
We used to play East
Compton all the time.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.537
You really had no idea, did you?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.866
Do you know what this means?

25:42.416 --> 25:45.540
My entire cheerleading
career has been a lie.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.295
Well, look on the bright side.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.380
It's only cheerleading.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.504
I am only cheerleading.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.305
Do you believe in curses?

25:57.306 --> 25:59.554
What are you talking about?

26:00.059 --> 26:02.011
I think I'm cursed.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.013
And why is that?

26:04.646 --> 26:07.440
This past summer at cheer camp,

26:07.858 --> 26:10.607
all the new seniors
had to do a dare.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.404
See, there's this thing
called the spirit stick,

26:13.405 --> 26:15.653
and it can never,
ever touch the ground.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.117
Torrance Shipman, your mission,

26:18.118 --> 26:21.367
should you choose to
accept it, and you better,

26:21.455 --> 26:23.874
is to capture the spirit stick

26:23.916 --> 26:27.996
and drop it in front
of the entire camp.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.732
Y'all are such
an inspiration to us.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.068
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you guys

26:52.069 --> 26:54.271
and take a picture of you

26:57.282 --> 26:58.908
with the spirit stick.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.737
Here.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.267
Here.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.060
I don't want it now.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.313
No, it's okay. The spirit
stick doesn't lose anything.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.858
The person who drops it, however,

27:32.234 --> 27:34.357
goes to Hades!

27:38.490 --> 27:42.115
I don't mean to laugh, but
cheerleading urban legends?

27:42.995 --> 27:46.790
You're not jinxed. Shit happens.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.756
Hey, I have to tell you something.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.924
I'm on the phone, creep.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.509
I realize that, and normally

27:58.510 --> 28:01.012
I'd be listening on the other
line, but this is important.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.805
Okay, what?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.557
Oh! Get out!

28:04.558 --> 28:05.975
Thank you for listening.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.770
Yo.

28:09.771 --> 28:11.230
- Is Aaron around?
<i>- Back later.</i>

28:11.231 --> 28:12.607
- Do you know when?
<i>- No.</i>

28:12.608 --> 28:13.941
Have him call Torrance.
It's urgent.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.314
<i>All right.</i>

28:15.569 --> 28:17.112
Big Red totally screwed us!

28:17.446 --> 28:19.363
I mean monster screwed us!

28:19.364 --> 28:21.365
I put this to the entire squad.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.700
Swear you guys didn't know?

28:23.785 --> 28:26.120
Big Red didn't exactly let any of us
help with the routines, Torrance.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.872
I cannot believe she did this.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.832
I feel awful. It's depraved.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.418
I mean, those East Compton girls
wanted to grill our asses.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.128
Big Red ran the show, man.

28:34.129 --> 28:37.381
I mean, we were just flying
ignorami, for sobbing out loud.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.967
We can't go to Regionals
with a stolen routine.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.052
It's too risky.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.430
Changing the routine now would
be total murder-suicide.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.681
Seriously.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.305
Let's not put the "duh" in "dumb."

28:48.644 --> 28:50.561
How are East Compton
gonna prove anything?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.313
You people are unbelievable.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.523
I mean, we're talking
about cheating here.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.648
Sorry, new girl,
but nobody hit your buzzer.

28:57.819 --> 29:01.739
Look, I hate to be predictable,
but I don't give a shit.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.659
We learned that routine
fair and square.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.244
We logged the man-hours.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.369
Don't punish the squad
for Big Red's mistake.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.750
This isn't about cheating.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.581
This is about winning.
Everyone in favor of winning?

29:27.933 --> 29:30.685
I get what you're saying,
Missy, but there's no time.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.562
If we don't do the routine,
we've got nothing else.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.016
So, you in?

29:41.738 --> 29:43.235
Whatever.

29:51.373 --> 29:52.832
Get out of here!

29:52.833 --> 29:56.082
Hey, this is the living room.
It's public domain.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.005
<i>Yo.</i>

29:59.006 --> 30:00.965
Hey, may I please speak
to Aaron? It's Torrance.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.218
<i>He's not here. He's, uh...
He's not here. Bye.</i>

30:07.639 --> 30:09.765
I'll take Famous Losers
for 200, Alex.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.058
Shut up, moron!

30:11.059 --> 30:12.226
It's not my fault you're in love

30:12.227 --> 30:15.104
with a big gay cheerleader who
won't return your phone calls.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.522
Aaron is not gay.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.899
Oh, so someone just made
him become a cheerleader?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.193
He's just busy!

30:21.194 --> 30:23.488
Yeah, busy scamming on guys.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.108
Give me that!

30:27.743 --> 30:29.115
Bitch!

30:35.292 --> 30:36.960
Where is she?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.455
Come on.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.175
- Oh, baby!
- Oh!

30:44.259 --> 30:45.468
Whoo!

30:45.469 --> 30:47.386
No way.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.681
Sexy mama!

30:49.848 --> 30:53.267
Whoo! Take it off!

30:53.268 --> 30:54.845
Whoo!

30:56.104 --> 30:58.773
Come on. Go, sexy.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.646
Whoo! You're on fire, yeah!

31:05.113 --> 31:06.906
You sure I can stay over
at your house tonight?

31:06.907 --> 31:09.116
Totally fine. My parents
are at some benefit.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.452
They'll be pouring themselves
into bed around dawn.

31:11.453 --> 31:12.995
Good. We gotta start early.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.540
You'll be a star cheerleader yet.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.625
You know, all the
cheerleaders in the world

31:17.626 --> 31:18.959
wouldn't help our football team.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.544
Man, it's just wrong.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.797
Cheering for them
is just plain mean.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.799
Everybody comes to
see you ladies, anyway.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.884
Because we're such fine athletes.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.135
Oh, live with it.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.514
You'll be fighting off major oglers
while we defend our sexuality.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.638
What is your sexuality?

31:33.642 --> 31:38.097
Well, Jan's straight,
while I'm controversial.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.231
Are you trying to tell
me you speak fag?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.690
Oh, fluently.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.401
And Courtney and
Whitney, dyke-adelic?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.693
- No!
- Are you kidding?

31:44.694 --> 31:45.820
I don't think so.

31:45.821 --> 31:49.031
See, Courtney doesn't wear
anything under her spankies.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.491
That's no excuse, Jan.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.333
I can't help it if my
digits slip occasionally.

31:53.453 --> 31:55.621
Nuh-uh. Slip? Where?

31:55.622 --> 31:57.957
Oh, come on, Missy.
Don't make him say it.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.250
Oh, my God.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.418
My God, too.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.496
You're a sick man, Jan.

32:02.838 --> 32:04.380
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

32:04.381 --> 32:09.178
<i>put your hands together
for the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>

32:17.185 --> 32:20.354
<i>And now, without further
ado let's hear it</i>

32:20.355 --> 32:23.941
<i>for the five-time National
Cheerleading Champions,</i>

32:23.942 --> 32:25.943
<i>the mighty Toros!</i>

32:39.541 --> 32:42.745
Go! Go! Come on!

32:44.629 --> 32:45.713
We're number one!

32:45.714 --> 32:48.174
Come on! Let's hear it!

32:48.175 --> 32:50.423
Whoo! Yeah!

32:52.012 --> 32:54.555
Bring it on, baby!

32:54.556 --> 32:56.758
Come on! Let's hear it! Come on!

32:58.935 --> 33:00.557
Go, Toros!

33:04.316 --> 33:06.817
Come on, Toros! Whoo!

33:06.818 --> 33:08.402
Go, Toros!

33:10.322 --> 33:12.069
Come on, Toros!

33:13.450 --> 33:15.242
Come on. Yeah!

33:15.243 --> 33:17.411
Yeah, Toros! Yeah!

33:20.499 --> 33:22.541
Whoo!

33:22.542 --> 33:25.044
Come on, guys, let's do it!

33:25.045 --> 33:26.086
Ready?

33:26.087 --> 33:28.797
<i>Yo-ho, go, everybody!</i>

33:28.798 --> 33:31.091
Why don't you let your
cheerleaders play for you?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.844
At least they win shit occasionally.
Oh, man, is that the best you got?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.638
Yeah, come on, bring
it on, butt plug.

33:35.639 --> 33:36.722
You want more? Okay.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.891
While we're out here
kicking your ass,

33:38.892 --> 33:40.893
- your cheer boys are over there...
- Ooh.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.603
scamming on all your squirrel.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.272
Which is cool, since you
don't have dicks anyway.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.398
Mmm-hmm.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.901
Bitch! Punk!

34:05.252 --> 34:08.295
<i>Hey, Toros
That's right</i>

34:08.295 --> 34:10.464
<i>The red, black and white</i>

34:10.465 --> 34:12.632
<i>Guess what? Guess what?</i>

34:12.634 --> 34:14.380
<i>You really suck</i>

34:19.349 --> 34:22.810
<i>Hey, that's all right, that's okay</i>

34:22.811 --> 34:24.978
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>

34:24.980 --> 34:27.273
<i>That's all right That's okay</i>

34:27.274 --> 34:29.650
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>

34:35.489 --> 34:38.112
Come on, guys! Touchdown!
Let's go, yeah!

34:42.330 --> 34:43.656
Oh!

34:46.458 --> 34:47.831
Nice.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.009
<i>Fourteen-nothing.</i>

34:55.010 --> 34:56.712
- Go!
- Hut!

35:03.602 --> 35:06.103
<i>And with 4:50 left in
the third quarter...</i>

35:06.104 --> 35:07.271
Losers.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.940
<i>It's Costa Mesa 34, Toros nothing.</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:11.400
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>

35:11.401 --> 35:12.526
Work!

35:12.527 --> 35:14.570
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>

35:14.571 --> 35:16.030
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>

35:16.031 --> 35:17.072

<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>

35:35.550 --> 35:36.717
Oh!

35:38.053 --> 35:39.379
Ooh!

35:40.263 --> 35:41.555
Jan!

35:43.558 --> 35:46.181
Go, Toros!

35:46.936 --> 35:48.262
Yeah!

35:50.148 --> 35:51.850
Come on, Toros!

35:53.777 --> 35:55.402
You're, like,
totally his eye candy.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.571
God, I can't believe
you'd do that to Aaron.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.656
Do what?

35:58.657 --> 36:00.240
Especially with him.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.076
What are you talking about?

36:02.077 --> 36:04.745
Oh, don't play dumb. We're
better at it than you.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.413
You're having cheer sex with him.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.166
<i>Flag on the play, it's
called against...</i>

36:09.167 --> 36:11.752
<i>You guessed it, the Toros.</i>

36:11.753 --> 36:15.673
<i>Remember, our next defeat is scheduled
for next Friday night at 8:00.</i>

36:17.217 --> 36:19.169
Let's go, Toros!

36:20.178 --> 36:21.971
Let's go, Toros!

36:23.264 --> 36:25.137
Let's go, Toros!

36:26.184 --> 36:28.136
Let's go, Toros!

36:29.187 --> 36:30.980
All right!

36:31.064 --> 36:34.108
We're sweet, we got the
whip We can't be beat

36:34.109 --> 36:35.734
<i>We're the best
Our team's too cool</i>

36:35.735 --> 36:37.820
<i>We got the class
to rock this school</i>

36:37.821 --> 36:39.613
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

36:39.614 --> 36:42.783
<i>We bad, we got the
team, we can't be had</i>

36:42.784 --> 36:44.618
<i>We're the best
So score them points</i>

36:44.619 --> 36:46.537
<i>You win the game
We'll rock this joint</i>

36:46.538 --> 36:50.457
<i>Go, Toros, go, Toros
Go, go, go, Toros</i>

36:50.458 --> 36:54.336
<i>Go, Clovers, go, Clovers
Go, go, go, Clovers</i>

36:54.337 --> 36:56.255
<i>Our game is fierce and we are hip</i>

36:56.256 --> 36:58.173
<i>So get on back
You can't touch this</i>

36:58.174 --> 37:00.050
<i>Our game is bad
We're without peer</i>

37:00.051 --> 37:02.386
<i>So get that weakness outta here</i>

37:02.387 --> 37:04.638
<i>Tried to steal our bit
but you look like shit</i>

37:04.639 --> 37:06.724
<i>But we're the ones
who are down with it</i>

37:15.024 --> 37:17.651
I still say we use
the routine we have.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.111
If we have to start over, I quit.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.907
<i>And that's the game.</i>

37:23.324 --> 37:25.909
Whoever here is for a new
routine, raise your hand.

37:25.910 --> 37:30.456
<i>Final score. Cougars
42, Toros nothing.</i>

37:31.040 --> 37:33.868
<i>Jan's got spirit, yes, he do</i>

37:34.043 --> 37:37.042
<i>Jan's got spirit, how about you?</i>

37:37.464 --> 37:39.416
Dude, you just lost.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.347
So, is every game that eventful?

37:47.348 --> 37:49.050
No. Thank God.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.684
We have a real situation
on our hands.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.395
I mean, we were humiliated
on our own turf.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.522
We might have to have a rumble.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.691
This is a serious problem!

37:57.692 --> 37:59.815
Oh, so is your breath.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.238
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.082
What are you doing?

38:55.083 --> 38:57.456
Um...

39:03.925 --> 39:05.509
Where's the bathroom?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.010
Right there.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.303
Oh!

40:32.680 --> 40:34.257
Good night.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.717
Night.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.897
Are you into my brother?

40:41.898 --> 40:43.975
No. I have a boyfriend.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.052
Hello.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.178
<i>Aaron?</i>

41:13.179 --> 41:15.222
Tor, is that you?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.224
Where have you been?
I keep trying to call you.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.768
Yeah, I know. I've been, like,
totally busy with school

41:19.769 --> 41:21.728
and practice and stuff. What's up?

41:21.729 --> 41:23.063
Oh, it's bad, Aaron.

41:23.064 --> 41:26.066
Miss Red snaked our routines
from the East Compton Clovers.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.943
- All of our routines.
- What?

41:27.944 --> 41:29.277
And they found out about it.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.989
They showed up at the game.
Gauntlets were thrown.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.908
Tell me you didn't know about this.
I mean, I don't know what to do here.

41:34.909 --> 41:38.453
Of course, I didn't know,
but you gotta calm down.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.163
<i>This is not that big a deal.</i>

41:40.164 --> 41:42.374
<i>Everybody uses
everybody else's material.</i>

41:42.375 --> 41:44.418
It's like this unwritten
rule or something.

41:44.419 --> 41:45.752
That doesn't help me.

41:45.753 --> 41:47.421
We can't do their
routine at Regionals

41:47.422 --> 41:49.506
because they're gonna do
their routine at Regionals.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.925
Come on, Tor,
you need a new routine.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.593
That's all. No problem.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.387
Just hire a professional
choreographer.

41:55.388 --> 41:56.847
A choreographer?

41:56.848 --> 41:58.682
<i>Look, just think of it
as collaboration.</i>

41:58.683 --> 42:00.977
<i>The UCA totally
looks the other way.</i>

42:01.102 --> 42:05.105
Call this guy.
His name is Sparky Polastri.

42:05.106 --> 42:07.024
<i>- Pen.
- Remember Nationals last year?</i>

42:07.025 --> 42:09.234
Knows his shit, all right?

42:09.235 --> 42:13.113
Here's the number. It's 555-7219.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.699
Thanks, Aaron. You
always know what to do.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.652
Mmm-hmm. Bye, baby.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.955
Mmm, who was that?

42:21.414 --> 42:23.874
My sister. Mmm.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.043
But you're not my sister, are you?

42:27.462 --> 42:29.585
He says we should hire
a choreographer.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.050
<i>Hello.</i>

42:33.051 --> 42:35.379
Hi. May I please speak
to Sparky Polastri?

42:35.803 --> 42:38.138
He'll need three or four days
to teach us the routine.

42:38.139 --> 42:41.843
But here's the thing.
It's gonna cost us $2,000.

42:42.477 --> 42:45.645
What, do I have the letters
A-T-M tattooed on my forehead?

42:45.646 --> 42:48.349
We were thinking more
like D-A-D-D-Y.

42:50.026 --> 42:52.024
Maybe I can get 500.

42:52.028 --> 42:55.323
Okay, then we only need
1500 more by Monday.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.240
What's up, Whitney?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.366
Hi.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.494
Here we are at the Rancho
Carne Toro car wash,

43:00.495 --> 43:02.242
raising a little money.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.622
<i>Yeah, baby, yeah!</i>

43:08.878 --> 43:10.253
<i>Work it, Kasey!</i>

43:10.254 --> 43:11.505
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>

43:11.506 --> 43:13.379
<i>Come to mama.</i>

43:13.508 --> 43:14.716
<i>Soak it up.</i>

43:14.717 --> 43:16.384
<i>Working hard for our money?</i>

43:16.385 --> 43:17.677
<i>That's a good shot, Les.</i>

43:17.678 --> 43:19.221
You're right.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.724
<i>Giving it a little
buff job. That's good.</i>

43:22.725 --> 43:24.684
<i>Oh, that's attractive, Tor.</i>

43:24.685 --> 43:26.978
<i>Looking good. Shaking the booty.</i>

43:30.858 --> 43:32.943
<i>Missy, what the hell are you doing?</i>

43:37.365 --> 43:38.573
<i>Watch it!</i>

43:39.867 --> 43:42.365
<i>Dude, watch out for the camera.</i>

43:55.383 --> 43:56.508
Hey, perv.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.054
Hand over your 15 bucks
or get out of here.

44:01.055 --> 44:02.305
What are you doing?

44:02.306 --> 44:04.683
Making money from guys
ogling my goodies.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.560
Aw, I didn't need
to hear that. I didn't.

44:06.561 --> 44:08.353
That was an over-share.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.773
Hey, Torrance. Come here a sec.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.528
We'll just get this over with.

44:16.696 --> 44:19.615
My brother wants to
check out your rack.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.744
You know, I begged my
mom for a brother.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.413
He'd look a little ridiculous
in that bikini, wouldn't he?

44:26.414 --> 44:28.332
Yeah.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.622
So, nice car.

44:31.335 --> 44:32.878
Yeah. Um...

44:33.421 --> 44:35.755
What can I say? I drive hard.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.215
Shouldn't take long to wash.

44:37.216 --> 44:39.718
Oh, don't even worry about it.
I got all afternoon.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.887
I'll bet you do.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.433
Where the hell is this guy?

44:46.434 --> 44:49.269
Listen, we're lucky he's
even doing this for us.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.833
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

45:19.467 --> 45:21.135
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>

45:37.818 --> 45:39.361
Great.

45:43.366 --> 45:45.660
- Thanks for coming. We're...
- Don't speak.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.701
You. You have weak ankles.

45:56.045 --> 45:59.169
One of your calves
is bigger than the other.

45:59.423 --> 46:01.216
Too much makeup.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.469
Not enough makeup.
What's with the skin?

46:04.637 --> 46:06.931
Say it with me, "Sunlight"!

46:08.975 --> 46:11.394
Male cheerleaders. Enough said.

46:12.603 --> 46:13.975
Smile.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.606
Don't smile.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.059
Jackass.

46:19.068 --> 46:21.691
Good general tone and musculature.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.158
Report those compliments
to your ass

46:27.159 --> 46:30.454
before it gets so big
it forms its own Web site.

46:33.249 --> 46:36.584
And you, I take you
to be the captain,

46:36.585 --> 46:39.129
which means you'll probably
need more work than anyone.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.547
- Look, you don't...
- Shh...

46:40.548 --> 46:42.591
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.468
Don't speak. Don't think.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.922
Listen and learn.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.680
I'm a choreographer.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.974
That's what I do.

46:58.524 --> 47:01.273
You are cheerleaders.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.780
Cheerleaders are dancers
who have gone retarded.

47:05.323 --> 47:08.948
What you do is a tiny,
pathetic subset of dancing.

47:09.410 --> 47:13.496
I will attempt to transform your
robotic routines into poetry,

47:13.497 --> 47:15.040
written with the human body.

47:15.458 --> 47:19.252
Follow me or perish,
sweater monkeys.

47:20.671 --> 47:23.840
I want you to think of what
you ate today. Got it?

47:23.841 --> 47:28.137
Now cut that in half. This is called
a diet. Everyone start one today.

47:28.637 --> 47:31.556
Darcy, honey,
you should stop eating.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.226
You see, when you skip a meal, your
body feeds off its fat stores.

47:35.227 --> 47:38.681
And if you skip enough, maybe
your body will eat your ass.

47:40.232 --> 47:42.810
Why does everyone
have to go on a diet?

47:43.277 --> 47:46.112
Because in cheerleading,
we throw people in the air,

47:46.113 --> 47:48.611
and fat people don't go as high.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.117
Come on, come on.
Let's get back to work!

48:01.337 --> 48:03.922
Hold her up! I want dangerous!

48:03.923 --> 48:05.924
I wanna feel like somebody's
gonna snap their neck!

48:05.925 --> 48:08.927
Spirit fingers!
Give me spirit fingers!

48:08.928 --> 48:11.805
Spirit fingers. Give me spirit!

48:13.891 --> 48:16.184
Ouch! Ouch!

48:16.185 --> 48:17.932
What? I told you I'd catch you.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.023
Look, I understand you have
underwear up your ass right now,

48:22.024 --> 48:23.900
but it beats the hell
out of a shattered skull.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.478
Think about it.

48:39.125 --> 48:41.794
Okay, now, spirit fingers.
Spirit fingers!

48:43.504 --> 48:45.422
And spirit fingers!

48:51.345 --> 48:52.470
Oh, my God!

48:52.471 --> 48:54.639
These are not spirit fingers.

48:57.643 --> 49:00.392
These are spirit fingers.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.565
And these are gold.

49:04.108 --> 49:07.778
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

49:07.862 --> 49:11.489
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

49:11.490 --> 49:12.574
Screw this.

49:12.575 --> 49:14.903
I did not sign on
for spirit fingers.

49:16.370 --> 49:19.369
Come on! The spirit
fingers are great!

49:19.540 --> 49:21.040
Yeah, whatever.

49:21.041 --> 49:22.914
We are so screwed.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.089
What's the matter?

49:35.222 --> 49:36.674
You don't wanna know.

49:37.224 --> 49:40.473
Ah! Cheer crisis.

49:42.188 --> 49:45.688
I've just gotten so bogged
down in all this crap.

49:46.484 --> 49:49.733
Well, if it's crap,
why do you do it?

49:51.739 --> 49:52.780
I don't know.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.403
So quit.

49:54.658 --> 49:55.950
Maybe I should.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.368
Yeah, I mean, if you
don't like it anymore.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.946
I didn't say that.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.618
Sounds like it.

50:01.916 --> 50:03.917
I don't know what I want.

50:03.918 --> 50:07.086
I remember back when I cheered
at my school in Detroit.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.088
You cheered at your
other high school?

50:09.089 --> 50:12.634
No, I never cheered, but I know
what you're going through.

50:12.635 --> 50:16.885
And regardless of all the
politics and the doubts,

50:17.431 --> 50:19.099
and the crap,

50:20.017 --> 50:22.436
you just have to know
that you can do it.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.649
And if it helps,

50:28.317 --> 50:30.064
I know you can.

50:31.487 --> 50:32.779
You do?

50:33.447 --> 50:34.773
Yeah.

50:38.369 --> 50:42.494
All right, all right! I'm ready
to make a fool of myself.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.825
State regionals, here we come.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.681
So much better than last year.

51:12.194 --> 51:15.523
Welcome to the world of
competitive cheerleading.

51:24.665 --> 51:27.417
High school divisions,
please check the signs.

51:27.418 --> 51:29.294
If you're not here,
your division will be...

51:29.295 --> 51:32.505
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

51:32.506 --> 51:37.553
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...

51:42.683 --> 51:44.260
Broncos!

51:45.811 --> 51:47.604
Ready? Okay!

52:07.625 --> 52:09.751
Some of these uniforms
look so skanky.

52:09.752 --> 52:11.002
Whatever. They're white trash.

52:11.003 --> 52:12.883
- Where do they get them?
- They're white trash.

52:14.965 --> 52:18.465
Cutter, I'm gonna kick
your ass, you evil whore!

52:18.802 --> 52:20.595
Get over it, hag!

52:20.596 --> 52:22.930
She did not just hit me!

52:22.931 --> 52:24.557
No, she's a little kid.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.392
You little...

52:26.393 --> 52:27.936
Get off me!

52:28.854 --> 52:30.521
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it, Courtney!

52:40.574 --> 52:42.902
Hi. You, yes.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.577
Your head was down.

52:44.578 --> 52:47.330
Your head was down
during that move.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.123
How are you gonna give a proper
score if you're not looking,

52:49.124 --> 52:51.793
if your head is down during a move?

52:56.590 --> 53:00.927
Remember, they give extra points
for alacrity and effulgence.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.880
Did we bring those?

53:03.472 --> 53:04.969
Oh, no. Look who's here.

53:15.567 --> 53:16.814
Hi.

53:24.618 --> 53:25.827
We're in trouble.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.662
<i>And now, making their
first appearance</i>

53:27.663 --> 53:33.211
<i>at the UCA California Regionals,
the East Compton Clovers!</i>

53:34.253 --> 53:35.830
Yeah, Clovers!

54:14.376 --> 54:15.623
Stop.

54:41.945 --> 54:44.864
<i>I'm standing here with five-time
national returning champions,</i>

54:44.865 --> 54:46.532
the Rancho Carne Toros.

54:49.912 --> 54:52.955
Leading the squad this year
is senior Torrance Shipman.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.041
<i>Torrance, one of the things
we've come to expect</i>

54:55.042 --> 54:58.628
<i>from the Toros over the last few
years is a highly original routine.</i>

54:58.629 --> 54:59.921
<i>Can we expect the same this year?</i>

54:59.922 --> 55:03.132
<i>Well, I think everyone goes
out there the same way,</i>

55:03.133 --> 55:06.803
<i>being as prepared as they can be
and just hoping for the best.</i>

55:06.804 --> 55:08.095
<i>We're just glad to be back here,</i>

55:08.096 --> 55:10.656
<i>and eager to see what some of the
other squads have come up with.</i>

55:12.392 --> 55:14.560
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

55:14.561 --> 55:15.978
<i>Isn't that Sparky?</i>

55:15.979 --> 55:18.981
<i>Well, thank you, Rancho
Carne Toros, and good luck.</i>

55:18.982 --> 55:20.775
<i>- And now, the Mighty Muskrats...</i>
- Thanks.

55:20.776 --> 55:23.104
<i>of Mesa Cucamonga!</i>

55:29.409 --> 55:30.868
Spirit fingers.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.992
They stole our routine!

56:03.777 --> 56:06.112
Keep that Trojan spirit up!

56:06.113 --> 56:08.114
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!

56:08.115 --> 56:09.991
- It's the curse.
- What?

56:09.992 --> 56:11.158
The spirit stick curse.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.451
Oh, God, will you
lay off with that?

56:12.452 --> 56:14.662
There's no curse, and
you're not going to Hades.

56:14.663 --> 56:17.123
News flash! Look around.
We are in Hades!

56:17.124 --> 56:19.827
Rancho Carne! You're up next!

56:21.461 --> 56:24.338
<i>And now, from San
Diego, California,</i>

56:24.339 --> 56:26.757
<i>the five-time
national champions,</i>

56:26.758 --> 56:30.219
<i>the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>

56:30.220 --> 56:31.971
Yeah! Yeah!

56:34.975 --> 56:36.392
I bet this is good.

56:40.939 --> 56:43.517
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>

56:51.491 --> 56:53.193
Didn't we just see this routine?

58:05.732 --> 58:07.309
What the f...?

58:15.200 --> 58:19.951
<i>The Rancho Carne Toros,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

58:20.664 --> 58:22.207
Go, Toros!

58:22.708 --> 58:23.955
Think they screwed up.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.463
That was, um, interesting.

58:29.256 --> 58:31.716
Y'all should've just
stuck with our routines.

58:31.717 --> 58:32.842
Yeah.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.163
Don't worry. We'll send you
a postcard from Nationals.

58:35.762 --> 58:39.223
<i>Next up, the Fighting
Beavers of San Bernardino.</i>

58:39.224 --> 58:40.599
- Torrance Shipman?
- Yes.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.393
Tad Freeman, Universal
Cheer Association.

58:42.394 --> 58:43.853
We have a problem.

58:43.854 --> 58:45.438
A problem?

58:45.439 --> 58:47.273
Oh, yes, a very big problem.

58:47.274 --> 58:48.441
Hey.

58:48.442 --> 58:49.612
I don't know if you can imagine...

58:49.613 --> 58:52.153
- Hey. - ...The incredible sense
of <i>déja vu</i> I experienced

58:52.154 --> 58:54.947
as I was watching
that last routine.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.741
I wouldn't just now.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.785
- What?
- Official cheer business.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.621
Come on. It's me. Hey, Torrance!

59:02.622 --> 59:04.244
You see, I...

59:04.291 --> 59:05.993
Not now.

59:06.293 --> 59:08.621
That was smooth. Real smooth.

59:09.212 --> 59:10.379
I'll see her later.

59:10.380 --> 59:11.923
All righty.

59:15.135 --> 59:18.804
Oh, uh, by the way,
nice spirit fingers.

59:18.805 --> 59:20.848
Yeah. Well, here's another.

59:23.769 --> 59:25.019
Thanks.

59:25.020 --> 59:29.148
Obviously your Toros aren't the only
squad with this particular routine.

59:29.149 --> 59:34.153
Does the name Sparky Polastri
mean anything to you?

59:34.154 --> 59:35.863
- Sparky Polastri?
- Mmm-hmm.

59:35.864 --> 59:39.742
Apparently he's been peddling this same
routine up and down the California coast.

59:39.743 --> 59:41.741
Six squads total.

59:42.079 --> 59:45.372
We're holding an emergency session
of the discretionary panel.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.457
About what?

59:46.458 --> 59:48.501
We've never had a situation
like this before.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.002
We really should
disqualify you and...

59:50.003 --> 59:51.462
No, no, don't punish the squad.

59:51.463 --> 59:53.672
It was my choice to hire
Sparky, not theirs.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.674
Don't penalize everyone
for my bad judgment.

59:55.675 --> 59:58.636
But since there's
no precedent for this,

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.304
there's nothing in the rule
books that forbids it.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.556
It's simply frowned upon.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:05.601
And I suppose we can't disqualify
you on those grounds alone.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.437
As defending champions, you are
guaranteed a bid to Florida,

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.564
but know that
we'll be watching you.

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.985
And don't expect to show up
at finals with that routine.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:19.698
What are you doing? You're
wrecking everything I built!

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.243
Hey, hey, hey, it's not totally her fault.
I was the one that hooked up...

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.495
This season should have
been gravy, okay?

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:27.581
I handpicked the squad, I
delivered an idiot-proof routine.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.792
Platter, Nationals, hello!

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.502
Don't you mean a stolen routine?

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:34.213
Don't be so naive, Torrance.

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:37.049
Look, the truth is I was
a real leader, okay?

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:38.884
I did what I had to do
to win at Nationals,

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.053
and ever since I handed
the reins over to you,

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.973
you've run my squad
straight into the ground!

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.267
If I made any mistake
as a squad leader,

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.102
it wasn't borrowing cheers,

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.681
it was announcing you
as my successor.

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.062
Uh-uh. Not cool.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.032
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:03.409
Let me go. I just wanna
get out of here.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.286
Hey, Big Red's a bitch.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:08.247
We all know that.
Even she knows that.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.957
I don't know what
to do here, Aaron.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.751
Look. I know I haven't
always been there for you,

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.253
since I went to college.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.298
It's been a rough
transition, for both of us.

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:20.968
But I still care about you as much
as I ever did. You know that, right?

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.928
- You do?
- Of course.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.764
Which is why I hate to see you
like this, all stressed out.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.766
It's not good for you.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:31.562
You're a great cheerleader,
Tor, and you're cute as hell.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.516
It's just that maybe...

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.314
Maybe.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:43.449
You're just not captain material,

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.823
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.079
Maybe you should consider letting
Courtney and Whitney take over the squad.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.956
They're just like Big Red.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.625
You want me to give up captain?

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.169
Hey, let them deal
with the politics.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.796
You just do what you do best, Tor.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.340
You cheer.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.715
Cheer, Tor. Okay?

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:06.131
I just wanna see you happy.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.028
Bye.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.539
Sleep tight, sweetie.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.312
Friend of yours?

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.690
He's my boyfriend.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.108
Look, Cliff, I can explain.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:03.981
No. It's cool.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:12.956
Here, um, I made you a tape, too.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.248
Cliff...

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.621
<i>Hey, Torrance, uh, it's me, Cliff.</i>

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.707
Um, here's...

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.335
<i>I wrote something for
you, so here it is.</i>

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.172
Oh, Torrance

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:06.300
<i>Can't stand your cheerleading squad</i>

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:09.803
<i>But I love your pom-poms</i>

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:14.600
<i>I'd feed you bonbons all night</i>

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.851
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:24.860
<i>Yeah, you got me to feel
all those butterflies inside</i>

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.237
<i>In your locker I would hide</i>

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.115
<i>The truth,
It's only you I see</i>

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.368
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.995
<i>I'd bring you flowers everyday</i>

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.581
<i>Just to roll you in the hay</i>

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.292
<i>Well, I'm feeling fine
I'm right on time</i>

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:44.171
<i>I know I'll get my way</i>

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:49.301
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:52.096
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:54.515
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.975
<i>'Cause you're just what I need</i>

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.561
<i>And you're just what I need</i>

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.314
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.817
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:06.611
<i>Shout out</i>

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:15.744
Aaron called us last night.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.414
He told us you're turning
the squad over to us.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:21.875
We want you know that just because
you bit the big one as captain,

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.002
does not mean we're gonna
be super hard on you.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.337
- Oh!
- We'll treat you as if

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:27.339
you didn't screw us
into the ground.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:28.962
Gee, thanks.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.719
Everyone, Torrance
is not to be harmed.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.173
We've already decided
on a course of action.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.485
We're gonna forego
Nationals this year.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.852
Everyone's already agreed to it.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.854
- Uh, except me.
- And me!

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.605
Both of you can be replaced.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.566
I can't believe you guys.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:49.403
The only person who can officially resign
the post of captain is the captain,

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:50.863
and I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:52.531
Then we'll have to overthrow you.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:53.904
Which we will!

01:05:53.908 --> 01:05:55.451
Enough!

01:05:55.827 --> 01:06:00.205
Our whole cheering career, we've staked
our reputation on being the best,

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.999
the most inventive.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.287
Now we finally have a chance
to truly be original,

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.421
and you're all running scared.

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:08.714
She's crazy.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.215
I am not crazy,

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:12.426
and I'm not resigning
as captain either.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:14.136
You're gonna have to kill me first.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.714
That can be arranged.

01:06:15.847 --> 01:06:17.765
Shut it, Whitney! Let her talk!

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:21.727
Look, I know I've screwed
up royally as captain,

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.395
but I believe in this squad,

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.981
and I know we can
bounce back from this.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.358
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.194
It's gonna be hard work.

01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:33.864
We need a new routine,
something amazing and fresh,

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.534
and we've got less than
three weeks till Nationals.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:40.412
But if we can do it,
if we can pull this off,

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:43.457
then we can really
call ourselves original.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:44.791
Now who's with me?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.172
How about it, girls?

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.296
It's gonna be hard without you two.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.919
Fine.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:57.964
Sure. Whatever.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.300
Okay. Let's do this.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.852
<i>We're gonna devote every
waking hour to practice,</i>

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:07.606
<i>before school, in between
classes and after school.</i>

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:10.817
<i>Afternoon practices will
have to be twice as long.</i>

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:14.029
<i>We've gotta do whatever it takes
to be in perfect physical shape.</i>

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.948
Yeah. You can go a little harder.

01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:16.990
There, there.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.116
Yeah, that feels good.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.410
Maybe we should join the squad.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.204
- Push.
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:23.914
Fag!

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.877
<i>And since the football team sucks
no matter how hard we cheer,</i>

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.706
<i>we'll use night games
to practice, too.</i>

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.131
<i>But that's not all.</i>

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.008
<i>We're gonna study
other types of movement,</i>

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.882
<i>from swing dance,</i>

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.304
<i>to interpretive dance...</i>

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.348
And you flow and you...

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:44.309
<i>even mime.</i>

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:49.357
<i>We'll draw inspiration from martial
arts, musicals, everything.</i>

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.357
<i>You guys know
we've got the talent.</i>

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:58.033
<i>We've just gotta work our asses
off and trust our instincts.</i>

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.868
<i>All of our instincts.</i>

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.377
Tor!

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.170
Wow! What are you doing here?

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:14.339
Just wanted to come by and see you.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.716
Is this a bad time?

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.301
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.636
I'm super busy. I'm
working on this project...

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.846
Yeah, you sound super busy.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.348
I guess that's it.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.809
You were too busy to believe in me.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.685
Oh, no, no, but wait.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:31.481
You weren't too busy to sell me out
to Courtney and Whitney, were you?

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.729
Gee, now I'm confused.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:37.314
Well, I hope you're not
too busy to hear this.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:40.567
Kiss my ass, Aaron! It's over!

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.707
You're a great cheerleader, Aaron.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.792
It's just that...

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.917
Maybe you're not exactly
boyfriend material.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.796
Bye-bye.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:08:59.885
You're a cheerleader?

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:12.064
UCA just posted the Nationals
list on the Internet.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.483
East Compton isn't on it.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:17.944
They couldn't raise the money
in time. They're not going.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.738
What do you mean,
"They're not going"?

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.740
Torrance, that's good news.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.867
They cannot not go.
That's not good news.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.202
What are you talking about?

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.496
They don't go, we win.
Once again we're the best.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:31.750
I define best as competing against the
best there is out there and beating them.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.419
They have to go.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.005
It's so unfair.
The first inter-city squad

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.508
to get a bid to Nationals
and they can't afford to go?

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.801
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning
off into another dimension.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:42.928
Justin!

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.180
The company gets hit up for
money all the time, honey.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.305
I just can't.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.934
It's not that much money,
Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.185
Tell them the deal.
Maybe they'll wanna help.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.479
Yeah? Okay, I'll make the call,

01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:55.440
but I'll tell you,
they'll probably say no.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:56.900
Don't let them.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.944
Think of how much it'll
mean to East Compton.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.113
They deserve to go.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.282
Do the right thing, Dad!

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.322
Did that just happen?

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:10.827
Yeah.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:13.750
"Where we come from, cheer is
not a word we hear very often."

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.628
"They should call us
inspiration leaders instead."

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.755
Oh, that's deep. I like that.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.465
I don't know why we writing
to some talk-show host.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:22.342
It's like we begging
for charity or something.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.803
It's not charity. Pauletta
Patton's from our neighborhood.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.680
She'll understand
why we need the money.

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:27.931
Tell her we need to buy donuts.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.558
Her big butt will understand that.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.310
Ha-ha! Stop being
counterproductive, all right?

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:35.480
Lava, please stop teaching her these
big words before she choke on one.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:38.692
No, better I choke you, Lafred.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.777
- Look, Jenelope...
- You guys, stop!

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:42.946
Please. Damn!

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:48.201
Well, tell her about the late-night
practices we've been having.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.655
There you go. That's the kind of
stuff she wants to hear about.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.035
Now we're talking.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.056
You guys have to go to Nationals.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.009
Did you come up here
just to tell me that?

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.187
Here. I got my dad's company
to sponsor you guys.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:16.688
What is this, hush money?

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:17.814
No.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.192
Oh, right. It's guilt money.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.152
You pay our way in and you
sleep better at night

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:25.482
knowing how your whole world is
based on one big, old fat lie.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:28.530
Well, you know what?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.615
We don't need you.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.208
Why do you have to be so mean?

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:37.959
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.046
Look, I'm trying to be
strong for my squad, okay?

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.714
That's what a captain does.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.674
Well, I'm a captain, too, you know,

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:46.627
and I'm trying to make it right.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.430
You wanna make it right?

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.682
Then when you go
to Nationals, bring it.

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:55.727
Don't slack off because
you feel sorry for us.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.896
That way, when we beat you,

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:00.190
we'll know it's
because we're better.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.769
I'll bring it. Don't worry.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.441
I never do.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:13.954
Yeah, your parents
just have to sign it.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:16.039
Okay, bye.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.662
Bye, Tor.

01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:28.677
I listened to your tape.
I loved it.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.761
Great.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.596
Can I talk to you?

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.224
I was upset that night.
Aaron gave me a ride home.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:36.977
It was just a good-night
kiss. It meant nothing.

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:38.680
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:42.525
And I wanted you to know
that I broke up with him.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.653
Congratulations.

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.155
He didn't believe in me.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.407
You did!

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.616
Whatever.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:55.447
That's important to me!
You believed in me!

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:13.930
Bite me.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:17.183
Hanging out with the air heads has really
sharpened your verbal skills, huh?

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:18.636
Screw you.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.013
Said the cheerleader.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.726
That's right, I am a cheerleader,
and you're a dumb ass.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:28.862
Torrance likes you, okay?
She likes you.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.530
She has an odd way of showing it.

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:31.948
Don't be stupid.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.742
She broke up with
her boyfriend for you.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.445
Yeah.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:40.499
Look. Do us all a favor and get over
yourself and tell her how you feel.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.747
I thought I had.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:44.704
Well, try again.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:48.253
And let me give you a little
tip from a cheerleader.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:52.677
Be aggressive.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.848
<i>Now back to Paulette!</i>

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.051
Thank you. Thank you.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.937
Today on Pauletta, it's "Wish Day"!

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:07.565
<i>Today's letter comes from
East Compton, California.</i>

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:09.319
"Dear Pauletta,

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.864
"Where we come from, cheer is not
a word that you hear very often,

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.407
"but that's what we are,

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.243
"the cheerleaders of
East Compton High School.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:20.372
"They should really call us
inspiration leaders,

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.290
"because that's what we do.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.376
"We inspire the people
from our neighborhoods

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:27.045
"to believe that our team can win.

<i>"That's why we're asking you
to fulfill our wish</i>

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:32.717
"to send us to the National
Cheerleading Competition

"for the first time."

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:37.555
Well, Clovers, you got your wish.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:40.308
Audience, the East Compton Clovers!

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.814
<i>Hi, Pauletta.</i>

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:49.025
<i>We just wanna say how thankful
we are for all of your help.</i>

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:52.988
<i>Pauletta, you my girl!
You the bomb, baby!</i>

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.990
<i>Ooh, Pauletta, girl,
we love you so much, girl.</i>

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.574
<i>I want to say you don't
have to lose a pound.</i>

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:57.951
<i>We love you just the way you are!</i>

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.246
<i>Pauletta, we're gonna make you
an honorary Clover for life.</i>

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:02.497
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:08.795
Ooh! I'm gonna look
good in this, y'all.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.433
So, is your family coming?

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:23.810
I don't know if Cliff's coming.

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:25.895
I totally blew it with Cliff.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:27.939
Forget it. My brother's an idiot.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.483
You're his sister. You
don't see him like I do.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:34.484
Yeah, and that's a good thing,
'cause that would be a crime.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.946
Hey, ladies, wanna
see my spirit stick?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.919
<i>Hey, this is Cliff. Leave
a message after the...</i>

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.466
Hello. Hello?

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:58.970
<i>Lock your doors. Bolt your windows.</i>

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:02.807
<i>Daytona, Florida, has been
invaded by teenage cheerleaders.</i>

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:04.017
<i>And what do they want?</i>

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:08.104
<i>The chance to be the number one
cheerleading squad in the country.</i>

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:11.357
<i>You know, in high school, I couldn't
pay a cheerleader to talk to me.</i>

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.152
<i>Now, I'm surrounded by them,
and let's face it,</i>

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:19.616
<i>any sport that combines gymnastics,
dance and short skirts is okay by me.</i>

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:23.119
<i>ESPN2 welcomes you
to sunny Daytona, Florida,</i>

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.664
<i>for the Universal Cheer
Association Nationals 2000.</i>

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:30.126
<i>Fifty squads from 50 high
schools across the nation</i>

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.087
<i>are gathered here to duke it out.</i>

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:35.465
<i>You wanna talk pressure? Ha-ha.
These kids are feeling it.</i>

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:39.511
<i>One individual mistake
can cost a squad everything.</i>

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:44.343
<i>Who's got spirit? We do,
baby. Only on the deuce.</i>

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.236
Hey.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:59.322
Watch going out of bounds. They
deduct like crazy for that stuff.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.282
What, you going for
sainthood or something?

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.034
You don't wanna blow it
on something tiny.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:06.037
Look, me and my squad made it to the
big show without any of your help.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.286
I think we can handle it.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:10.834
Stay in bounds!

01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:14.379
If any of you step outside that
ugly blue carpet, you are dead.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.505
Happy?

01:17:15.506 --> 01:17:16.707
Yes.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.926
Tell your girl on the end she's about
a half second early on all her moves.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.262
Okay, I will. Happy?

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:23.806
Yep.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:26.179
Hey, remember.

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.053
Bring it.

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.690
And what the hell was that about?

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.564
It's boom, boom...

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:39.151
We just understand
each other, that's all.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.115
All right, let's do this.

01:17:42.116 --> 01:17:43.784
- One, two, three.
- Clovers!

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.168
<i>The field has been narrowed,
and the advancing squads</i>

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:19.003
<i>will move on to tomorrow's finals.</i>

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.838
<i>Defending champs, the Toros,</i>

01:19:20.839 --> 01:19:24.342
<i>have managed to come back from a
humiliating showing at Regionals.</i>

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.886
<i>But the real Cinderella
story here, of course,</i>

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:30.182
<i>is the Clovers of East
Compton, California.</i>

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.394
Kasey's popping zits again.

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:37.230
Gross, Kasey. You're totally
bedaubing the mirror.

01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:38.398
Clean it off.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.566
Okay, okay! All right.

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:47.532
I don't know what's scarier, neurotic
cheerleaders or the pressure to win.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:51.283
I could make a killing selling
something like Diet Prozac.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.871
Thank God you're here
this season, Missy.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.540
I couldn't have done it alone.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.125
Oh! Tear.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.249
No, I mean it!

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.344
Shut up! You don't have
it yet, you don't have it!

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:09.888
Give it up already!

<i>By sundown, only one squad</i>

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:20.232
<i>can call themselves UCA
National Champions 2000.</i>

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.774
Shit!

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.866
Where the hell are my spanky pants?

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:30.783
What's that on his head?

Don't be shy, ladies.
Donations are always welcome.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:38.038
Hey, babe. Are you
in a giving mood?

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.369
Sure.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:44.547
Get lost, freak, or I'm
gonna tell all your friends

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.257
that you were at a
cheerleading competition.

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:47.759
You wouldn't.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.382
Oh, I would.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.013
Hey, I recognize these.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:54.932
That was perfect.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:59.479
Your basket toss was amazing,
and no one saw that landing.

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:02.016
Really?

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.526
We should find your tooth.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.697
<i>Colorado Springs, Colorado!</i>

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.990
Hey.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:14.824
That last lift you did was amazing.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.746
Thanks.

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:18.706
Hey, good luck out there.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.708
Thanks, man. I'm Les.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.502
I'm Tim.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:23.795
It's nice to meet you.

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:25.171
Hey, I'll see you around?

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:26.669
Yeah.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.387
Okay, now focus and
don't be nervous.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.638
I'm not nervous.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:36.099
No, just try not to think
about the stakes, okay?

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:38.351
I'm totally cool. I'm so ready.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:43.183
The main thing that you must
remember is always smile!

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.022
Sorry.

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.323
Man, my stomach is killing me!

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:55.493
Yo, relax, girl. You're
making me even more nervous.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.947
You guys, look. Gather up.

01:21:58.497 --> 01:21:59.997
Guys, we got this.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:03.543
We have done this routine
a million times. Just relax.

01:22:03.544 --> 01:22:05.169
Forget about all those
faces out there

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:07.338
and just imagine that
we're back at our school,

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.465
in our gym, just doing our thing.

01:22:09.466 --> 01:22:11.092
We'll be fine. All right?

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:13.094
East Compton Clovers, you're up!

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.512
All right, now let's
do this, Clovers.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:15.805
Yeah!
