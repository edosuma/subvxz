Arrogance diminishes wisdom.}

00:16.975 --> 00:18.725
<i>Republic outpost overrun!</i>

00:19.291 --> 00:22.523
<i>The Jedi have lost all contact
with the clone security force</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:25.995
<i>stationed on the bleak
snow-covered planet of Orto-Plutonia.</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.289
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker,</i>

00:28.414 --> 00:31.280
<i>accompanied by dignitaries
from the nearby moon of Pantora,</i>

00:31.545 --> 00:34.408
<i>are sent to investigate
the disappearance of the clone troopers</i>

00:34.788 --> 00:37.388
<i>on the desolate
and forbidding landscape.</i>

00:43.317 --> 00:45.533
And this is the planet's
tropical zone.

00:45.658 --> 00:48.127
It's not Tatooine, that's for sure.

00:48.542 --> 00:51.129
Captain Rex,
have your men survey the area.

00:51.254 --> 00:54.354
Place as many sensor beacons
as you can before dark.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.938
Right away, sir.
Unload that gear!

00:57.063 --> 00:58.113
Let's move!

00:59.512 --> 01:02.563
Why would the Republic
want an outpost way out here?

01:03.051 --> 01:04.150
The chairman

01:04.757 --> 01:07.687
of Orto-Plutonia requested it?
Why?

01:09.265 --> 01:10.486
General Kenobi.

01:11.002 --> 01:12.952
Chairman Cho, Senator Chuchi.

01:13.384 --> 01:16.158
I suggest you wait here
until we can secure the area.

01:16.862 --> 01:18.828
I respect your judgment,
General Kenobi,

01:18.953 --> 01:22.717
but I will go where I choose.
This is sovereign Pantora territory.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.585
I thought this planet was uninhabited,
and therefore, it's not aligned.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.444
Our moon of Pantora
is the only civilization in this system.

01:30.849 --> 01:33.550
I'm the one who asked the Senate
to protect this planet.

01:34.192 --> 01:36.283
This wasteland belongs to us.

01:37.330 --> 01:39.227
With all due respect, Chairman,

01:39.352 --> 01:41.767
this is for the Senate to decide,
not us.

01:42.329 --> 01:44.529
But the Jedi report to the Senate,

01:44.716 --> 01:46.966
which is Senator Chuchi of Pantora.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.651
Technically speaking, Master Jedi,
the Chairman is correct.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.903
Since the planet is uninhabited,
the moon of Pantora reserves the right

01:54.072 --> 01:56.115
to continue as its protectorate.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.016
Point taken, Senator.

01:58.308 --> 02:00.642
Anakin, stay here with the Senator
and the droids

02:00.767 --> 02:02.459
while we secure the base.

02:15.881 --> 02:17.053
I don't get it.

02:17.565 --> 02:19.215
It must be Separatists.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.540
I am not sure.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.442
Might we go inside, Master Anakin?

02:24.728 --> 02:26.645
R2 would like to get
out of the cold.

02:28.553 --> 02:31.484
We'll go inside as soon as
Obi-Wan signals that it's safe.

02:36.586 --> 02:40.409
Do you think the Separatists're building
a forward base to attack Pantora?

02:40.848 --> 02:43.131
I don't think we're dealing
with Separatists.

02:43.256 --> 02:45.183
These computers
haven't been touched.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.680
Sir, our scouts have spotted
a droid base

02:47.805 --> 02:50.055
on the other side of the ice ridge.

03:09.297 --> 03:12.647
By the look of things,
I'd say whoever attacked our base

03:12.925 --> 03:15.229
took out the droids also.
Rex,

03:15.654 --> 03:17.627
help Anakin
place the sensor beacons.

03:17.752 --> 03:20.352
- You four, come with me.
- Yes, General.

03:20.970 --> 03:21.920
Let's go.

03:43.012 --> 03:44.348
Did you find anything?

03:48.028 --> 03:50.028
I found some large footprints.

03:50.744 --> 03:53.296
Have one of your men make a cast.

04:04.048 --> 04:07.348
- Sensors are in place.
- I think I've found something.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.831
Blast it.

04:12.397 --> 04:15.151
<i>685 to command.
There are too many of them!</i>

04:15.767 --> 04:18.981
<i>They've overrun the base.
We need reinforcements!</i>

04:20.077 --> 04:23.470
- What was that?
- Whatever it was, it's a good warrior.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.807
The droid's log indicates they were
investigating the southern canyon.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.467
Sounds like a good place to start.

04:33.163 --> 04:35.973
I want the weapon system back online
and the shields operational.

04:36.098 --> 04:38.270
There's no telling
what the Separatists have planned.

04:38.395 --> 04:40.447
Chairman, what makes you so certain

04:40.572 --> 04:42.572
the Separatists
are behind this attack?

04:43.132 --> 04:44.575
Look around, Senator.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.827
Isn't this carnage proof enough?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.480
I know,
but there are no dead droids here,

04:49.605 --> 04:52.481
no blast marks. The clones' injuries
were not consistent with what...

04:52.606 --> 04:55.627
So you're an expert on war now,
are you, Senator?

04:56.039 --> 04:57.189
No, Chairman.

04:57.885 --> 05:00.544
- No, I only...
- Let me tell you something, Senator.

05:00.669 --> 05:03.494
I have led our people
since before you were born.

05:03.619 --> 05:07.019
Ive seen 100 planets rise and fall
through force of arms.

05:07.327 --> 05:10.814
If it's not the Separatists,
it's a malevolentenemy nonetheless.

05:10.939 --> 05:13.552
And I will not let whoever it is
jeopardize the security

05:13.677 --> 05:15.427
of the people of Pantora.

05:15.552 --> 05:18.859
But if the Jedi discover
that the Separatists aren't behind this,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.611
then perhaps
there is a peaceful resolution.

05:22.391 --> 05:26.200
Senator, I am willing to fight and die
for my people.

05:26.747 --> 05:30.547
It's time to ask yourself
if you are brave enough to do the same.

05:37.194 --> 05:39.255
There's some kind of reflection
up there.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.623
Do you see it?

05:40.748 --> 05:41.620
Yep.

05:46.543 --> 05:49.043
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go.

06:23.128 --> 06:25.716
Steady, Anakin.
They're only curious.

06:28.427 --> 06:32.327
Let's not provoke them as the droids
and our troops must have done.

06:48.731 --> 06:50.785
Too bad we didn't bring 3PO along.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.172
How do you plan on communicating
with these things?

06:53.297 --> 06:56.356
Patience.
Maybe they're smarter than we are.

07:04.831 --> 07:06.478
Well, say something.

07:07.119 --> 07:08.269
Just shut up.

07:29.664 --> 07:31.574
We come to you in peace.

07:32.565 --> 07:34.393
We will not bring harm.

07:38.092 --> 07:38.892
Peace.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.913
Glad you made it back, sir.
It's getting nasty out there.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.386
You don't know the half of it.

08:23.892 --> 08:24.962
What did you find?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.756
It seems we've stumbled
onto an inhabited planet.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.166
Impossible.

08:29.437 --> 08:32.966
Our explorers have spent much time here
over the long history of Pantora.

08:33.091 --> 08:35.681
No one lives here.
They're trespassers.

08:36.096 --> 08:39.181
With respect, Chairman Cho,
these creatures, the Talz,

08:39.306 --> 08:41.804
aren't advanced enough
to master space travel.

08:41.929 --> 08:44.523
I think they may have been here
longer than Pantora.

08:44.864 --> 08:47.199
Whoever they are, they belong to us.

08:47.601 --> 08:49.570
This whole system belongs to us.

08:49.979 --> 08:52.784
Your majesty,
if there are life forms here,

08:53.076 --> 08:55.451
then the Senate
must decide jurisdiction.

08:55.619 --> 08:56.969
They are savages.

08:57.094 --> 08:59.746
Look at what they've done.
They've slaughtered your troops.

09:00.087 --> 09:02.187
They only want to be left alone.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.044
The droids attacked them, and I'm afraid
our outpost got caught in the middle.

09:06.434 --> 09:09.094
They must be subdued.
They're dangerous.

09:09.437 --> 09:11.675
Captain Rex,
prepare your troops for battle.

09:12.211 --> 09:14.803
We promised their chief
there would be no retaliation.

09:15.158 --> 09:17.946
We've arranged a meeting
between their high council and you

09:18.071 --> 09:20.271
and the Senator.
They want peace.

09:20.396 --> 09:22.728
We can't send troopers.
They'll think we lied.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.104
These creatures
are little more than animals.

09:25.229 --> 09:28.192
You can't lie to an animal.
They can't be trusted.

09:28.528 --> 09:30.392
- But, your majesty...
- No!

09:30.517 --> 09:32.727
It is obvious these creatures
are not covered

09:32.852 --> 09:34.849
by the convention
of civilized systems.

09:34.974 --> 09:36.950
The Jedi Council
has no say in the matter.

09:37.662 --> 09:40.512
If the Jedi are able
to communicate with them,

09:41.050 --> 09:42.706
their status is in doubt.

09:43.037 --> 09:45.500
Do you stand against your chairman,
Senator?

09:45.668 --> 09:47.085
Of course not, your majesty.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.500
If we're going to meet with Thi-Sen
and his council at the arranged time,

09:50.625 --> 09:51.844
we'll have to leave now.

10:01.473 --> 10:03.429
The gunships can't take off
in this storm.

10:03.554 --> 10:05.732
We don't have enough bikes
for the entire platoon.

10:05.857 --> 10:07.834
Have the rest of the men
stand by here.

10:07.959 --> 10:11.442
No matter what the chairman thinks,
we're not going to war.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.806
Captain, put your men
on that ice ridge.

10:33.931 --> 10:36.731
We will attack
as soon as the savages arrive.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.906
- There will be no attack, chairman.
- You will do as I command.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.381
This planet
is under my jurisdiction.

10:43.506 --> 10:46.006
Nothing is under your control,
Chairman.

10:46.131 --> 10:47.931
The Talz are already here.

10:48.056 --> 10:51.149
Their scouts have been following us
for some time.

10:51.678 --> 10:55.542
It seems thi-sen doesn't trust you
any more than you trust him.

11:03.483 --> 11:05.890
Rex, tell your men to stand down.

11:06.145 --> 11:08.750
Stay here and don't do anything
to provoke them.

11:09.195 --> 11:10.145
Yes, sir.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.636
Your Highness.
We have returned...

11:22.395 --> 11:23.495
As promised.

11:32.428 --> 11:34.628
These savages have no rights here.

11:35.912 --> 11:38.354
Chieftain Thi-Sen
welcomes you to his home

11:38.479 --> 11:41.853
and hopes you come in peace.
He wishes to be good neighbors,

11:41.978 --> 11:44.494
but he does not wish you
to remain on his planet.

11:44.818 --> 11:47.913
Listen, droid,
translate everything I say

11:48.282 --> 11:50.250
and exactly as I say it.

11:50.732 --> 11:53.210
Would you like me to in this matter?

11:53.502 --> 11:57.382
Not on your life, Senator.
There will be no diplomacy this time.

11:57.955 --> 12:00.385
Listen here, you savage, this world

12:00.553 --> 12:02.361
belongs to the moon of Pantora.

12:02.486 --> 12:05.890
And as the Supreme Chairman
and exalted ruler of Pantora,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.859
you will not command me to leave
this planet or do anything else.

12:10.507 --> 12:12.768
Your Majesty, we can't.

12:13.741 --> 12:15.442
Droid, tell him.

12:16.187 --> 12:17.074
Dear.

12:18.178 --> 12:21.218
I recommend
a less confrontational discussion.

12:21.343 --> 12:23.293
The Talz are easily provoked.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.433
That didn't go over very well.

12:30.558 --> 12:34.294
Chairman, I promised the Talz
that we would leave them in peace.

12:35.072 --> 12:37.255
This is now an internal affair
of Pantora.

12:40.255 --> 12:42.798
The great Thi-Sen, son of suns,

12:42.923 --> 12:45.996
asks again that you leave
or it will mean war.

12:46.449 --> 12:47.932
Then war it is.

13:09.843 --> 13:11.993
Troopers, mount up and follow me.

13:14.742 --> 13:15.874
What's up, general?

13:15.999 --> 13:18.630
You're gonna stay with the chairman
until we can work things out.

13:18.970 --> 13:20.720
Protect him at all costs.

13:21.043 --> 13:22.947
Mount up! We're moving out!

13:24.381 --> 13:27.097
Senator, you know
a preemptive strike is illegal.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.470
Isn't there anything you can do
to stop him?

13:29.595 --> 13:30.850
I'm afraid not.

13:30.975 --> 13:33.603
He has proclaimed this conflict
an internal affair.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.731
You could petition the Jedi council
for an intervention.

13:37.127 --> 13:39.234
You mean, without his authorization?

13:39.402 --> 13:41.653
There must be someone on your moon
who could approve it.

13:42.171 --> 13:45.021
The speaker of the assembly.
He has the power.

13:45.146 --> 13:47.599
Let's get back to the base.
The storm is letting up.

13:47.724 --> 13:49.753
Maybe we can get
a transmission through.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.713
Here they are.
Fire when you're in range.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.366
Sir, with all due respect,
we're only here to protect you.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.896
- Ambush!
- It's a trap. Kill them!

14:31.371 --> 14:33.288
We're surrounded.
Defensive formation!

14:38.521 --> 14:39.669
Chairman, get down!

14:57.939 --> 14:59.539
We've got to hold out!

15:04.983 --> 15:07.792
Fall back!
First squad, cover the retreat!

15:07.917 --> 15:08.817
Retreat?

15:08.942 --> 15:11.242
We can't retreat from these animals.

15:16.112 --> 15:17.012
Savages.

15:48.613 --> 15:50.100
<i>The assembly has decided</i>

15:50.225 --> 15:52.492
<i>that the actions of Chairman Cho
are out of order.</i>

15:52.970 --> 15:55.080
<i>Senator Chuchi,
you're given the authority</i>

15:55.205 --> 15:56.981
<i>to negotiate a peaceful settlement</i>

15:57.106 --> 15:59.624
<i>between the sovereign planet
of Pantora and the Talz.</i>

16:00.199 --> 16:03.149
- It is decided then.
- Pilot, let's get moving.

16:21.911 --> 16:23.161
Here they come!

16:32.056 --> 16:34.201
Senator, now that you have
the authority,

16:34.326 --> 16:36.578
how do you plan on making peace
with the Talz?

16:37.488 --> 16:40.888
Actually, Master Jedi,
since you're far more experienced,

16:41.013 --> 16:43.460
I was hoping you could negotiate
on Pantora's behalf.

16:46.049 --> 16:48.006
I'm afraid that's not possible,
Senator.

16:48.914 --> 16:51.637
But I don't understand.
The Jedi serve the Senate.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.655
- I must order you to...
- Senator,

16:53.780 --> 16:56.181
it is your people
the Talz are at war with.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.809
If the violence is to stop, it is you
who must represent your people.

18:16.339 --> 18:18.853
- Good to see you, sir.
- You okay, Rex?

18:18.978 --> 18:21.349
- It's just a scratch.
- What's going on?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.036
We're in quite a mess, sir.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.770
11 dead, the rest wounded,
including the Chairman.

18:31.056 --> 18:32.856
Chairman, can you hear me?

18:33.676 --> 18:35.113
Senator, good.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.505
You much avenge me.

18:39.139 --> 18:41.870
As my final command
as chairman of Pantora,

18:42.893 --> 18:45.365
I order you to destroy the Talz!

18:45.998 --> 18:48.398
I'm afraid
I cannot do that, Chairman.

18:48.523 --> 18:51.338
The Pantoran assembly
has called you out of order.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.006
I am to negotiate peace.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.561
No...

18:55.220 --> 18:56.270
Impossible!

18:56.736 --> 18:57.469
Peace?

18:58.771 --> 18:59.571
Never!

19:00.685 --> 19:02.867
I died for our... people.

19:09.542 --> 19:10.442
Senator,

19:11.227 --> 19:12.527
now is the time.

19:23.258 --> 19:25.455
Protocol droid, come with me.

19:25.849 --> 19:27.597
3PO, get going.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.197
Yes, Master Ani.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.035
Droid,

19:54.307 --> 19:56.657
- translate for me.
- Yes, Mistress.

20:01.757 --> 20:03.407
To die for one's people

20:03.655 --> 20:05.205
is a great sacrifice.

20:05.684 --> 20:07.434
To live for one's people,

20:08.093 --> 20:09.749
an even greater sacrifice.

20:16.491 --> 20:18.541
I choose to live for my people.

20:19.086 --> 20:20.218
What do you choose?

20:38.901 --> 20:40.738
He chooses to live as well.

20:41.086 --> 20:42.702
We will leave Orto-Plutonia

20:42.827 --> 20:46.103
under the watchful eyes of the Talz
from this day forth

20:46.228 --> 20:48.021
and recognize your sovereignty

20:48.205 --> 20:50.055
as a free and equal people.

21:19.054 --> 21:21.004
- Well done, Senator.
- Yes.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.014
Most impressive.

21:23.139 --> 21:24.789
Thank you, Master Jedi.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.328
Now that you have created peace
between your people and the Talz,

21:29.657 --> 21:31.504
remember one crucial thing.

21:31.629 --> 21:33.079
Yes, Master Kenobi?

21:33.407 --> 21:35.007
Make it last, Senator.

21:35.793 --> 21:36.943
Make it last.

21:37.441 --> 21:40.602
And be an example to others
so not only this war,

21:40.727 --> 21:43.872
but every war waged
may come to an end as well.

21:44.547 --> 21:45.397
I will.

21:45.878 --> 21:46.971
I promise you.

22:05.013 --> 22:07.063
<i>There's a treator in our midst.</i>

22:07.188 --> 22:10.538
- Take a seat, gentlemen.
- <i>And it's one of my brothers.</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:14.213
<i>First, someone sent General Kenobi
and Skywalker into a trap.</i>

22:14.338 --> 22:15.959
Come and get me, boys.

22:16.127 --> 22:16.877
Move!

22:17.161 --> 22:19.271
<i>Then, he blows up the hangar deck.</i>

22:19.396 --> 22:22.096
<i>It can only be one of my brothers.
But who?</i>

22:22.221 --> 22:23.121
<i>And why?</i>

22:23.551 --> 22:24.676
<i>I'm gonna find out.</i>

22:25.332 --> 22:26.657
- Stop!
- <i>Make him pay.</i>
