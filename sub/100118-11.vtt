WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.482
Previously onDynasty...You are a liar and a murderer!

00:04.526 --> 00:06.006
FALLON:
Why I'm moving out
of the manor.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.356
We're gonna put Blake away
for a long time.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.619
ADAM:
I-I just burned down
Father's vineyard.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.229
The only way that we're
gonna have a relationship

00:12.273 --> 00:13.622
is if we put
the past behind us.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.058
That's never gonna happen.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.147
Alexis was the one
that shot Mark

00:17.191 --> 00:18.105
and cost us our baby.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.672
Then we killed
an innocent man.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.383
This is quite a tantrum.

00:35.426 --> 00:36.906
Even for you, Blake.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.038
How the hell
did you get in here?

00:38.081 --> 00:39.300
Security at the manor has always

00:39.343 --> 00:40.736
had a soft spot for me.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.825
Now, do you want to chat,
or do you want

00:42.868 --> 00:44.783
to spill something else?Just your blood.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.091
I have nothing to say to you,
so don't even try to apologize.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.310
I won't.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.920
I don't have anything
to apologize for.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.095
Are you kidding?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.662
You shot and killed
Mark Jennings

00:53.705 --> 00:55.055
while aiming at my wife!

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
You forced me into desperation.

00:57.144 --> 01:00.147
And sometimes desperate women
shoot at desperate things.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.975
Are you seriously
blaming me for your actions?

01:03.019 --> 01:05.065
I'm not afraid of you.

01:05.108 --> 01:08.242
I can manipulate you
into doing anything I want.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.982
Including murder.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.087
JENNINGS:
Another nightmare?

01:28.262 --> 01:29.132
Yeah.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.307
But nothing time

01:30.351 --> 01:33.005
and a stronger sleeping
pill won't heal.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.529
How are you feeling?

01:34.572 --> 01:35.834
I'm angry.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.402
Aren't you?

01:38.446 --> 01:39.969
Alexis tricked us

01:40.012 --> 01:41.492
into killing
an innocent man.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.668
Cristal, Mack was no angel.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.192
Trust me, I'm furious.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.019
It's why I'm
not sleeping.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.282
God, I fell for her lies again.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.935
Then what's
our plan?

01:49.979 --> 01:52.155
How are we gonna make sure that
we never have to see her again?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.330
Honey, there's no plan.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.766
Alexis is like
a whack-a-mole game.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.029
You knock her down,
she just pops up somewhere else.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.118
It's a waste of our
time and our energy.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.162
So we just
ignore her.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.337
Hey, I need to get control

02:00.381 --> 02:01.556
of my life again.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.210
And that means not
letting her disrupt

02:03.253 --> 02:04.385
the momentum
that I have.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.213
I got a big day planned.

02:06.256 --> 02:08.780
And I got someone special
coming for you.

02:08.824 --> 02:12.219
All right?

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
It's time for you
to let your anger go.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.136
What if I don't
want to?

02:16.179 --> 02:17.441
Ow! Ow.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.270
Hey.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.316
Well, you'd better.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.448
Before you give yourself
third-degree burns.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.798
Please just
give it a shot for me.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.325
KIRBY:
"Blake Carrington is back

02:31.368 --> 02:32.978
"and ready to take what's his.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.371
"While a murder
trial would hinder

02:34.415 --> 02:35.677
"the progress of
most mortals,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.070
"it's only emboldened
Mr. Carrington,

02:38.114 --> 02:40.203
"who is poised and ready to
once again conquer Atlanta,

02:40.247 --> 02:41.813
if not the country."

02:41.857 --> 02:43.206
Gross.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.817
They are calling me
the "forgotten Carrington."

02:45.861 --> 02:47.297
And they're right.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.213
In the past 24 hours,
five possible investors

02:50.257 --> 02:51.997
have stopped calling me back,

02:52.041 --> 02:55.218
two magazines have decided I am
not a juicy enough cover story,

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
and a children's art competition
dropped me as a judge.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.048
Although that one
might be unrelated.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.049
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

03:00.092 --> 03:01.355
Well, I'm gonna stop swearing

03:01.398 --> 03:02.921
near elementary schools,
for one.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.358
No, about Blake.Listen.

03:04.401 --> 03:05.620
He can have Atlanta.

03:05.663 --> 03:08.840
I am taking Fallon Unlimited
international.

03:08.884 --> 03:11.234
Starting with our newly named

03:11.278 --> 03:12.888
Fallon Unlimited Streaming.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.324
You own a streaming service?

03:14.368 --> 03:16.108
You're not just talking
about your Netflix account?

03:16.152 --> 03:18.328
Kirby, of course I own
a streaming service.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.635
No, it was one of the assets
I bought with Femperial.

03:20.678 --> 03:23.246
But if I don't expand upon it,
it'll get lost in the sea

03:23.290 --> 03:24.943
with thousands of other
streaming services.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.728
And it will be very embarrassing
when I have to shut it down.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.469
Well, if you need more content,

03:28.512 --> 03:30.471
I have plenty of ideas
for TV shows.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.255
Mostly including dogs.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.344
Thank you, but I am
already in talks

03:34.388 --> 03:37.304
with a European network
called Corlent Media.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.306
I'll be an unstoppable
international force

03:39.349 --> 03:40.568
with them by my side.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.265
You know, with Blake
back on the scene,

03:42.309 --> 03:44.311
I have to work harder than ever
to get noticed.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.574
And that is exactly
what I am doing.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.710
Hello?

03:54.625 --> 03:56.279
Hello?

03:57.324 --> 03:58.368
Mother.

03:58.412 --> 03:59.587
Hello.

03:59.630 --> 04:00.979
Adam.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.329
What are you doing here?

04:02.372 --> 04:04.287
Painting.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.202
Blake kicked me
out of the manor,

04:06.246 --> 04:07.725
so I'm crashing here until I can

04:07.769 --> 04:09.161
figure out
what to do next.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.511
Please don't make me leave.

04:10.554 --> 04:13.818
Because your linens
are very soft and flowery.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.603
Of course you can stay.

04:15.646 --> 04:16.821
But I hope you're
not waiting

04:16.865 --> 04:18.345
for Blake to forgive you.

04:18.388 --> 04:19.737
He loved that vineyard
more than his own mother.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.391
He'll come around.
Hmm.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.263
And if he doesn't?

04:24.351 --> 04:27.484
Maybe you should reconsider
helping me and Jeff.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.313
You and I are more alike
than you may care to admit.

04:30.357 --> 04:34.143
But you can't just hang out
painting cats all day.

04:34.186 --> 04:36.363
I know how much
you need direction.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.190
Not if that direction
means hurting Blake.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.105
And that's what this marriage
is about, right?

04:40.149 --> 04:42.499
This grand plan to destroy him.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.196
I don't know what you mean.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.025
Jeff and I married for love.Mm.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.636
It would mean the world to me

04:48.679 --> 04:50.507
if my husband and son
could get along.

04:50.551 --> 04:51.900
Please just leave it, Mother.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.206
Trust me, right now,
I'm perfectly content

04:54.250 --> 04:55.295
remaining neutral.

04:57.906 --> 05:01.736
No one with the name Carrington
can remain neutral forever.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.352
Ah, uh, uh, uh, uh.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.701
I have to meet Fallon
for breakfast.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.876
And I can't be late,

05:11.920 --> 05:13.878
because every time I'm late,

05:13.922 --> 05:15.663
she guilts me
into a million favors.

05:15.706 --> 05:18.056
Uh, you know, I could eat, too.Mm.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.102
And I'd like to get
to know Fallon better.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.321
Didn't you used
to work for her?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.931
Trust me, nothing's changed.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.194
Other than maybe her highlights.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.153
Yeah, but she only met me
as Fletcher Myers, PR genius.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.460
Not Fletcher Myers,
boyfriend of Sam.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.986
I'm sorry, that just, uh,

05:35.030 --> 05:37.380
just slipped out.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.339
But I can tell
you're feeling really

05:39.382 --> 05:40.949
comfortable
and normal about it.

05:40.992 --> 05:41.950
What?

05:41.993 --> 05:43.386
No.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.866
Yes.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.346
I'm great.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.652
Should we talk?

05:48.696 --> 05:51.133
You look like you're about
to break out in hives.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.222
Can we please not
bring my skin into this?

05:53.265 --> 05:54.702
I'm fine.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.539
Adam?

06:07.889 --> 06:09.586
Hey. Kirby, hi.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.414
Um, I'd love to chat,

06:11.458 --> 06:12.807
but I'm a little busy right now.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.548
Busy... lurking?

06:14.591 --> 06:16.463
Look, Blake can't know I'm here.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.290
Aren't you two a little old
to be playing hide-and-seek?

06:18.334 --> 06:19.988
No, I need to get some stuff
from my old room,

06:20.031 --> 06:21.424
but Blake's banned me
from the manor.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.513
Oh, what'd you do
to get the boot?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.385
Um, just a little...

06:25.428 --> 06:26.777
arson.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.431
Can you really have
just a littlearson?

06:28.475 --> 06:29.867
Yeah.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.522
Well, seeing as
I'm officially a resident

06:32.566 --> 06:34.829
of the manor again, why don't I
just get your stuff for you?

06:34.872 --> 06:36.483
It's actually the least
I could do,

06:36.526 --> 06:38.267
seeing as you helped get me
out of Synergy.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.617
That would be great, because
I think I hear Blake coming.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.538
SAM:
I need to talk to you about
Fletcher and the "B" word.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.452
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.975
I'm about to show you a finger

06:51.019 --> 06:52.803
of my own if you don't start
paying attention to me.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.066
My merger is falling apart.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.459
You and Liam are
breaking up again?

06:56.503 --> 06:58.548
No. Liam is on some
writing retreat.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.028
I'm talking about...

07:00.071 --> 07:02.465
I was supposed to merge
with a European network, but now

07:02.509 --> 07:04.511
they're trying
to put my deal on ice.Why?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.426
Well, I don't know.
Apparently, I don't have enough

07:06.469 --> 07:08.166
existing European subscribers.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.472
So now they're
entertaining offers

07:09.516 --> 07:11.474
from larger streaming services.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476
I didn't know you had
a streaming service.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.999
Or is this just
your Netflix account,

07:15.043 --> 07:17.480
which, by the way,
stop changing your password.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.571
Fine, I'll entertain myself.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.443
Fletcher called me
his boyfriend earlier,

07:23.486 --> 07:25.140
and I kind of freaked.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.534
I-I guess I didn't see it
happening so soon, but...

07:27.577 --> 07:30.319
I mean, don't get me wrong,
our selfies are great.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.495
And-and the sex is...

07:32.539 --> 07:33.714
Well, I was gonna go
with "fire,"

07:33.757 --> 07:35.019
but I guess that works, too.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.499
They just ended negotiations.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.153
I can't have my merger
falling apart

07:38.196 --> 07:40.111
when Blake is getting
back into the game.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.896
If he's winning,
it's bad optics for me.

07:41.939 --> 07:44.028
You know, it's like
a-a ripple effect

07:44.072 --> 07:46.901
or a domino effect
or some kind of bad effect.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.556
Are you even listening to me?

07:49.599 --> 07:50.948
Whoa.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.080
What's with
the meat parade?

07:52.123 --> 07:53.603
Los Falcones.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.039
They're a huge soccer team
from Spain,

07:55.083 --> 07:56.867
and they're playing
the Atlantix tonight.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.870
Fletcher's turning it
into a big PR bonanza.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.612
Aw, are you still seeing him?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.527
I was literally

08:04.571 --> 08:06.050
just talking
about him.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.574
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:07.617 --> 08:09.793
This game is airing
in Spain, right?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.534
Mm-hmm.This is perfect.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.536
I can bring
Fallon Unlimited Streaming

08:13.580 --> 08:16.321
directly to
the Spanish consumers.

08:16.365 --> 08:17.540
How?

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
Well, I have to talk
to Culhane first,

08:19.586 --> 08:22.327
but if I can prove that
I'm turning things around,

08:22.371 --> 08:23.590
then Corlent will sign,

08:23.633 --> 08:25.374
I will save
my streaming service,

08:25.417 --> 08:28.072
and Blake will be reading
articles about me.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.988
Oh, no, I will not be forgotten.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.424
Oh, is that bacon?

08:57.406 --> 08:59.060
So, are you going to
tell me what this is?

08:59.103 --> 09:01.628
Because I know it's not
a random act of generosity.

09:01.671 --> 09:02.672
No offense.

09:02.716 --> 09:03.978
It's to celebrate
our partnership.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.675
You know, between
Fallon Unlimited Streaming

09:05.719 --> 09:07.329
and the Atlantix.

09:07.372 --> 09:09.070
Are you interested
in the stadium naming rights?

09:09.113 --> 09:11.115
Because the fans have their own
section with their names,

09:11.159 --> 09:12.943
but you can have the actual...No, no, no, no, no.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.510
That's a waste of money.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.818
But do you remember the time
I so generously signed over

09:17.861 --> 09:21.473
my shares of the Atlantix
to you, no strings attached?

09:21.517 --> 09:23.432
Let me guess, you want
to attach some strings.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.217
Well, according to my research,
half of Spain will be watching

09:26.261 --> 09:28.045
the soccer game tonight,
and I want in.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.960
If you don't want
the naming rights, then what?

09:30.004 --> 09:31.179
You want to be
the new goalkeeper?

09:31.222 --> 09:33.355
No, no. I have very
delicate fingers.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.618
But I was thinking I could
use the halftime show

09:35.662 --> 09:37.054
to promote my company

09:37.098 --> 09:38.969
and get my number
of subscribers up.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.318
Since when do you own
a streaming service?

09:40.362 --> 09:42.582
Well, since...
it's not the point.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.409
Look, I usually run
our mascot out there

09:44.453 --> 09:46.150
to keep the energy levels up
at halftime.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.152
This isn't the Super Bowl,
Fallon.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.676
No one actually watches
the halftime show.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.113
I have a feeling they're
gonna want to watch this.

09:52.156 --> 09:53.984
See?

09:54.028 --> 09:57.640
Fireworks, a drumline,
Fallon Unlimited signage

09:57.684 --> 10:00.861
across the entire stadium,
and of course,

10:00.904 --> 10:02.776
a limited promotion offer

10:02.819 --> 10:05.300
to my Spanish viewers
to subscribe.

10:05.343 --> 10:08.825
You do know the game
is tonight, right?

10:08.869 --> 10:11.828
Yeah, well, I'm having my
assistant work on the logistics.

10:11.872 --> 10:15.310
Sorry, Fletcher has
something small planned already.

10:15.353 --> 10:17.181
You know, to promote
the actual team.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.753
Look, we can run
a graphic on the screen

10:23.797 --> 10:26.147
and announce
that halftime is sponsored

10:26.190 --> 10:28.279
by your service,
but that's the best I can do.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.367
Take it or leave it.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.543
Oh... yeah, I'll take it.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.158
But we'd love an opportunity
to convey our enthusiasm

10:37.201 --> 10:39.551
to Mr. Sawyer over dinner.

10:39.595 --> 10:42.685
If you could just...

10:42.729 --> 10:45.514
Fine. Thank you. Thank you.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.866
He rejected our third offer and
won't even meet to discuss it.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
And now we've kicked up
enough dust

10:51.346 --> 10:52.869
that Blake is bound to notice.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.131
We have to move fast.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.176
We've done our homework, Jeff.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.438
It's time to use it.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.309
No, that was supposed to be
a last resort.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.268
Okay? I'm not comfortable
with blackmail.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.574
Nobody is comfortable
with blackmail.

11:02.618 --> 11:06.187
But I respect your morals,
so I have a solution: Adam.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.493
Adam is your solution?

11:08.537 --> 11:10.495
Your son is a wack job.

11:10.539 --> 11:11.801
No offense.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.411
He might have inherited
the worst

11:13.455 --> 11:15.239
of both Blake and myself.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.024
But that's what
makes him valuable.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.722
We bring him on
as a dirty work consultant.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.115
He'll do what
you don't want to do.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.377
I can't work with him.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.334
Okay?

11:23.378 --> 11:24.771
Just let this one rest.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.695
Tony. Hi.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.697
How are the kids?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.090
Honestly, that was
just rhetorical.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.224
I'm going to need a favor.

11:43.267 --> 11:45.269
Someone needs to tell Blake

11:45.313 --> 11:47.402
there's an intruder
on the property.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.231
ANDERS:
After recent
revelations,

11:50.274 --> 11:52.799
is it really wise to go
on a shopping spree right now?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.235
What do you mean by that?

11:54.278 --> 11:55.410
It would be perfectly
reasonable for you

11:55.453 --> 11:57.455
to take a little bit
more time to heal.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.848
Hey, buying is healing.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.458
That's why they call
it retail therapy.

12:00.502 --> 12:02.286
Now let's buy
some companies.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.768
Today is a day of healing.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.291
Let's start by taking

12:07.335 --> 12:09.424
a deep breath in
through the nose.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.297
And push it all out
through the mouth.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.430
Ah.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.174
People are calling this
the "Peloton of boxing."

12:20.217 --> 12:21.262
Anders, Anders, this is amazing.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.567
You got to
check this out.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.047
Tai chi is more my speed, sir.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.353
The company
is still private,

12:25.396 --> 12:28.008
and they currently have
eight investors.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.574
Well, buy them out.
Do I look like I want to be

12:29.618 --> 12:31.576
the ninth investor?
Get it done.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.798
TERRI:
So you're holding a lot
of tension in your shoulders.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.409
And...

12:38.453 --> 12:40.281
everywhere, actually.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.022
Can we try something else?

12:44.285 --> 12:47.505
Ugh, this alcoholic seltzer
is disgusting.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.507
Yeah, I know,
but it's a gold mine.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.595
Let's buy 'em out.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.163
Go.

12:53.207 --> 12:57.037
TERRI:
We use lemon quartz to cleanse,

12:57.080 --> 13:01.737
activate and balance
the third energy center.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.958
So release all of the negativity
you feel, and in its stead,

13:05.001 --> 13:08.831
invite in clarity,
communication

13:08.875 --> 13:11.138
and happiness.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.880
This isn't working.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.273
MARCUS:
This is SilverFlix.

13:16.317 --> 13:19.450
A media streaming service
with a healthy subscriber base,

13:19.494 --> 13:20.712
expanding daily.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.062
Well, sir, if I may, uh,

13:22.105 --> 13:23.890
purchasing this will put you

13:23.933 --> 13:25.935
in active competition
with Fallon, who's trying

13:25.979 --> 13:29.243
to rehabilitate her own
streaming service at the moment.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.680
Say no more. Let's make Fallon
work for something

13:31.723 --> 13:33.725
once in her life.
Buy it.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.336
TERRI:
I will monitor
your heart rate

13:35.379 --> 13:38.730
as we go through some
potential triggers.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.080
Ready?

13:47.957 --> 13:50.655
You're making
progress.

13:54.616 --> 13:55.922
You're spiking.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.404
Okay. Uh, you know what?

14:00.448 --> 14:03.407
It's time for you to see
a real therapist, Cristal.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.235
In with the light, out
with the negativity.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.196
Yep.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.111
Hey, I, uh... Ooh.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.026
You're not wearing a shirt.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.766
Was I supposed to be?Oh...

14:14.810 --> 14:17.160
No. I... I shouldn't
have said that out loud.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.422
I'm sorry. Um, anyway,

14:18.466 --> 14:20.772
here's some things
that looked important.

14:20.816 --> 14:21.948
Extension cord?

14:21.991 --> 14:23.210
Well, "important"

14:23.253 --> 14:24.385
means different things
to different people.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.995
It's great. Thank you.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.170
I appreciate it.

14:27.214 --> 14:30.739
Um, I wish I had
something to offer you.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.480
I have instant noodles.

14:32.523 --> 14:33.785
Oh, no. No, don't worry.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.831
I should be the one
thanking you.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.486
Hey, how about I cook you
dinner tonight? With real food.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.314
Not instant noodles.Well, it's been about a week

14:40.357 --> 14:43.273
since I've had real food,
so, yeah, sure.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.755
Cool. Well, you know,
feel free to wear a shirt.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.800
Or not. You know,
it's really up to you.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.413
Kirby.
Dad?

14:52.456 --> 14:53.805
Anders.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.720
What are you doing here?

14:55.764 --> 14:59.202
She was helping me get
some stuff from the manor.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.204
Ah. Well, perhaps she should

15:01.248 --> 15:03.467
take the opportunity
to grab the rest.

15:03.511 --> 15:06.818
Apparently, Tony the gardener
saw you skulking

15:06.862 --> 15:08.255
and alerted Blake
to the fact

15:08.298 --> 15:09.647
that you're staying
here in the loft.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.475
He wants you out
by month's end.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.477
Well, he can't do that.
Blake doesn't own the loft.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.826
My mother does.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.003
That's true, but he owns
all the land around it,

15:17.046 --> 15:18.918
so he can stop you
from coming or leaving.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.136
I'm sorry.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.749
Son of a bitch.

15:30.625 --> 15:34.281
Uh, so, 7:00 work for you?

15:35.325 --> 15:36.674
Mm-hmm.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.981
SAM:
I love presents.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.027
No, no, no, no.
It's not for you.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.072
These are for the
Corlent people.The who people?

15:43.116 --> 15:45.988
Corlent. The European network
I need to merge with.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.598
I told you about it
this morning.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.165
Yeah, I was totally
listening to you

15:49.209 --> 15:50.558
when you were
talking about that.Well,

15:50.601 --> 15:52.603
I sent the private jet

15:52.647 --> 15:54.823
to grab the CEO and his people

15:54.866 --> 15:57.173
so that we can meet in person
after the Atlantix game.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.566
They are very impressed
with my idea

15:58.609 --> 16:00.176
to corner the Spanish market.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.917
I never knew you were
so obsessed with Spain.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.005
Oh, of course.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.485
I love Spain.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.008
I'm so sorry.What happened?

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
Did the jet not leave
with the Corlent group?

16:07.531 --> 16:10.708
Well, they... a jet left,
and they did get on it, but...

16:10.752 --> 16:13.320
Come on. Spit it out.
What's going on?

16:13.363 --> 16:16.497
Apparently, your father bought
his own streaming service,

16:16.540 --> 16:19.369
and Corlent is interested
in partnering with him.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.371
So he also
got them a plane.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.546
You should go.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.639
I am going to kill that man.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.645
You are like a solar eclipse,

16:34.689 --> 16:37.648
just blotting out
everything that's not you.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.042
Would you relax?
It's just business.Yes.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.436
My business.
I was going international.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.307
You are supposed
to worry about Atlanta.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.701
But no, you have to find
the one thing I'm working on

16:46.744 --> 16:48.224
and try to sabotage it.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.097
It's just a coincidence, Fallon.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.576
You didn't invent
streaming media.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.014
I didn't even know you had
a streaming service.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.928
But it's what everyone
wants right now,

16:56.972 --> 16:58.669
and I'm no different.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.324
Oh, give me a break. You can't
even use an Apple TV remote

17:01.368 --> 17:02.891
without asking Anders for help.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.632
They're not user-friendly.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.242
And, you know, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

17:06.286 --> 17:10.116
I thought you'd be eager to rise
to the challenge, not run away

17:10.159 --> 17:11.291
like a little girl.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.945
Like a little girl.

17:13.989 --> 17:17.819
I am more than capable of
keeping up with you, Daddy.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.647
I'm not running anywhere.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.649
I will see you
on the battlefield.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.520
And I will shoot on sight.

17:23.564 --> 17:24.826
Hey, hey, whoa!

17:24.869 --> 17:26.436
Fallon!

17:26.480 --> 17:28.221
Shots fired.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.092
You two had a fight
in the lily pond

17:30.136 --> 17:31.528
because she totaled your car?

17:31.572 --> 17:34.314
I Googled the boundaries
of patient-therapist privilege

17:34.357 --> 17:37.230
in the state of Georgia, so yes.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.840
Why does that make you
so much angrier

17:38.883 --> 17:40.537
than some of the other things
she's done?

17:40.581 --> 17:44.628
Because not only
did she wreck my car,

17:44.672 --> 17:46.761
she-she blamed
someone else for it

17:46.804 --> 17:48.763
and let him take the punishment.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.765
And it was two cars she wrecked.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.333
Anger can often come
from the expectation

17:53.376 --> 17:55.813
that people
will treat us justly.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.815
You might need to adjust
your expectations.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.295
How do I do that?

17:59.339 --> 18:00.862
My professional
opinion?

18:00.905 --> 18:02.429
You have to see Alexis again.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.736
But I can tell
there's still something there

18:05.780 --> 18:07.129
you need from her.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.610
Maybe you're on the hunt
for a glimmer of humanity

18:09.653 --> 18:11.220
or something
that might

18:11.264 --> 18:12.700
justify her actions.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.441
There isn't anything
in the world

18:14.484 --> 18:17.966
that could justify
what she did to me and my car.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.881
It seems like
a waste of time.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.970
You can't control others,
Cristal.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.538
You can only control
your own reactions.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.760
Let this token personify
the control you need.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.415
If you feel your
anger consuming you,

18:32.459 --> 18:34.417
focus your energy
on the token.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.463
Harness it,

18:36.506 --> 18:40.423
and then release
it healthfully.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.600
Don't worry. Took me a while
to find my style, as well.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.167
How could he
do this to me?

18:45.211 --> 18:47.300
I've been on my best behavior
for weeks.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.779
You burned down
his winery.

18:48.823 --> 18:49.954
Since then.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.869
I wish I could say
I'm surprised,

18:51.913 --> 18:54.872
but Blake has never been
the forgive-and-forget type.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.528
Just know...

18:58.572 --> 19:00.487
I have your back.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.141
I will dig a tunnel
to the main road

19:02.184 --> 19:03.751
if that's what you need
to live here.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.535
Blake will not win.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.623
I promise.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.458
Mother, I'm so sorry.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.678
God, the things
I-I've done to you. I...

19:17.721 --> 19:20.246
When I first got
here, all I wanted

19:20.289 --> 19:21.682
was a perfect family,

19:21.725 --> 19:24.075
and I've blamed everyone else
for ruining that dream.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.687
But it's Blake.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.558
He's the one
who's fractured this family.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.605
Yeah.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.433
I think I'm ready.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.261
If you still want my help.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.480
I happen to have
something important in motion

19:37.524 --> 19:38.960
later this afternoon.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.701
Will Jeff be there?

19:40.744 --> 19:43.573
Not today.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.576
Today, it can be
just you and me.

19:47.577 --> 19:48.578
No. No, no, no.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.971
Please. You were
late to breakfast.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.581
You owe me.You were early.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.975
Well, I already created
a PR crisis at the hotel,

19:54.018 --> 19:55.455
so now you just need to
ask Fletcher for help

19:55.498 --> 19:57.239
so he leaves the stadium
while I go over there

19:57.283 --> 19:59.198
and make changes
to the halftime show he set up.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.503
What makes you think
Fletcher will choose me

20:00.547 --> 20:01.809
over his actual job?

20:01.852 --> 20:03.724
Oh, I don't know.
Do you think he'll choose

20:03.767 --> 20:06.205
his cute, charming boyfriend
who needs his help

20:06.248 --> 20:09.512
or that low-maintenance,
stupid, boring halftime show?

20:09.556 --> 20:10.861
I think we both know the answer.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.733
And seriously,
what are you so afraid of?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.213
Oh, I don't know.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.432
Maybe that my new b...Oh.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.218
That Fletcher will figure out
that I lied to him.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.176
Aren't there any other companies
you can merge with?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.309
No. Not now that Blake
is going after that one.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.614
If he wins Corlent,

20:24.658 --> 20:26.573
the story will read,
"Blake Carrington bests

20:26.616 --> 20:28.923
his loser daughter, Fallon
Carrington, once again,"

20:28.966 --> 20:30.446
and I will never
be taken seriously.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.882
And I have already promised
these people

20:31.926 --> 20:34.189
that the halftime show
will be a huge spectacle.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.757
Why would you promise that?Well, you know I always put
the Cartier before the horse.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.367
And it works. Always.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.457
Hold on. What PR crisis
did you start at my hotel?

20:41.501 --> 20:43.416
Oh, in a little while,

20:43.459 --> 20:45.113
people are going
to start picketing

20:45.156 --> 20:46.636
about your unfair
labor practices.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.334
I don't have
unfair labor practices.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.552
Which is why
you have to call

20:49.596 --> 20:50.988
Fletcher and get him over there.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.381
We can't have this turn

20:52.425 --> 20:54.253
into a PR nightmare.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.474
Cristal.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.084
Does she have
any weapons on her?

21:00.128 --> 21:01.695
Don't worry, I've been frisked.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.044
Twice.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.915
You can never be too careful.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.613
After all,
you did attack me unprovoked.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.268
Unprovoked? You...

21:10.747 --> 21:13.663
I'm not here for
a rematch, Alexis.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.405
I was just hoping to have
an adult conversation.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.234
My therapist feels it's
imperative for my healing.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.063
And your leaving is imperative
for my workout.

21:22.106 --> 21:25.719
Don't you feel any remorse
about what you did?

21:25.762 --> 21:27.503
Did you come here
hoping I would?

21:27.547 --> 21:30.201
That I would beg
for forgiveness?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.639
I find that
charmingly... sad.

21:32.682 --> 21:35.598
I don't understand how
you can be so callous.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.122
Practice, practice, practice.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.821
And it's going to be perfect
when I destroy you.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.997
You're insane!

21:44.694 --> 21:46.827
Now that the truth
has come out about everything,

21:46.870 --> 21:49.046
I don't have to pretend
to like you.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.744
And let's get real.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.486
Blake is never gonna
do anything to harm me.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.924
Thanks for the chat, Alexis.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.708
Let's do it
again sometime.Mmm.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.754
♪ She's a maniac...

22:03.583 --> 22:05.585
Finally.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.544
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.025
Jeff. What an
unpleasant surprise.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.766
Let me guess.
Alexis told you

22:12.809 --> 22:14.333
she was the one
you were meeting.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.986
Yeah, and I said
I didn't want to work with you.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.727
Yeah, I told her
the same thing.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.555
So I should probably go?

22:19.599 --> 22:20.948
Yeah. Yeah.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
Unless you're willing
to put aside

22:22.558 --> 22:23.690
our differences
just for today.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.561
I'm really not.All right, look.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.172
I don't know the specifics,
but it's a two-person job,

22:28.216 --> 22:30.697
and we need to bug a room
before a meeting.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.047
Alexis says
time is of the essence.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.570
Yeah. Then it was
reckless of her

22:34.614 --> 22:36.398
to waste a day
with this nonsense.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.704
Yeah, but if you back out now,

22:37.747 --> 22:39.836
it just gives Blake time
to slip out of trouble.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.666
I'm sorry about the poisoning.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.842
That was a bad judgment call
on my part.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.367
But it's over now,
and clearly, you're fine.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.107
All right, is it gonna
make you feel better

22:50.151 --> 22:51.631
if you punch me in the face?

22:55.852 --> 22:58.420
That did make me feel
a little better. Thanks.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.030
Your uniform's in the trunk.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.210
All right,
just keep it simple, okay?

23:06.254 --> 23:08.778
Just get in there, switch
the carbon monoxide detector

23:08.822 --> 23:10.476
in the room
with the one we miked up,

23:10.519 --> 23:12.478
and get out.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.090
Yeah?

23:16.133 --> 23:18.571
Hello. I am Boris
with hotel maintenance.

23:18.614 --> 23:19.876
I have come to replace

23:19.920 --> 23:21.312
carbon monoxide detector.

23:21.356 --> 23:22.836
That is not keeping it simple.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.054
Now's not a good time.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.447
Uh, it only take minute.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.057
I said it's not a good time.

23:27.101 --> 23:28.276
I'm expecting someone.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.844
Nyet.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.846
I cannot leave.
It is against law

23:32.889 --> 23:34.848
to stay in room
with malfunctioning detector.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.327
You'll have to switch rooms.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.503
No, no, no,
he can't switch rooms.

23:37.546 --> 23:38.721
I am not switching rooms.

23:38.765 --> 23:39.896
Please!

23:40.941 --> 23:42.856
I do not need
to install it now.

23:42.899 --> 23:46.294
If I could just leave it in
your room and come back later?

23:46.337 --> 23:48.818
I just can't let my boss
see me return with it. Please.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.517
Fine. Now get out of here.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.913
Boris out.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.917
And Mr. Culhane is
really okay with this?

24:00.961 --> 24:03.746
Okay with us putting on
a kick-ass halftime show

24:03.790 --> 24:05.661
and letting the world see
what you can do?

24:05.705 --> 24:07.402
Oh, I think
he's more than okay, Scotty.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.360
It's just what you're
asking me to do--

24:09.404 --> 24:11.624
you know, weaving in between
fireworks displays,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.234
jumping on a
trampoline.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.715
I mean, those moves
usually take me

24:15.758 --> 24:17.412
a full day
of training.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.806
I-I understand that what
Phil the Phoenix does out there

24:19.849 --> 24:23.157
doesn't seem very nuanced or
complicated to you, but it is.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.333
You shoot T-shirts
out of cannons.

24:25.376 --> 24:26.769
It's hardly
Cirque du Soleil.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.728
I went to Juilliard.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.773
Which is depressing, but...

24:30.817 --> 24:32.775
Juilliard is expensive.

24:32.819 --> 24:35.604
So how about I give you $50,000

24:35.648 --> 24:38.738
to not do the halftime show
and to keep your mouth shut?

24:38.781 --> 24:40.435
Leave the head,
take the cash?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.002
Come on, Scotty.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.790
I'll Venmo you.

24:47.834 --> 24:48.922
Here you go.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.229
Absolutely not.
Why don't you do it?

24:52.273 --> 24:55.145
No. I need to monitor the number
of subscribers coming in.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.539
Besides, you have
these strong, broad shoulders.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.150
You could fill out this costume
in ways I never could.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.501
I've already lied to Fletcher
once for you today.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.503
But I do have nice
shoulders, so thank you.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.982
Fletcher's busy dealing
with labor unrest, okay?

25:06.026 --> 25:07.767
All you have to do
is go out there

25:07.810 --> 25:09.159
and be your lively self
in front of

25:09.203 --> 25:11.161
the "Fallon Unlimited
for Spain" sign.

25:11.205 --> 25:13.120
Come on. It'll be fun.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.691
Fine, but only because this
is the closest I'll ever get

25:18.734 --> 25:21.868
to playing Pluto at Disneyland,
which has been a lifelong dream.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.870
Oh, it'll be great, I promise.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.611
Boop.JEFF:
Did you really think

25:25.654 --> 25:27.874
you could Parent Trapme
and Adam into liking each other?

25:27.917 --> 25:29.092
I don't know what that means.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.617
But this mission was
a success, I hope.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.053
Yes.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.403
But you deliberately
went against what I said.

25:35.446 --> 25:38.885
I took a calculated risk,
and clearly, it paid off.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.670
Adam's allegiance to
Blake is taken care of.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.803
And now the only thing
standing in the way

25:43.846 --> 25:46.022
of a fruitful
partnership is...Oh, me?

25:46.066 --> 25:48.677
I was gonna say "your
stubbornness," but yes, you.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.200
I told you I have my reasons.

25:50.244 --> 25:52.376
He is my son, Jeff.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.553
I-I know he can be
a little difficult,

25:54.596 --> 25:56.598
but deep down,
he has a good heart.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.383
He poisoned me.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.516
He purposely had
my office walls painted

26:01.560 --> 26:03.866
with toxic paint,
and I almost died.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.434
I'm still sick now,
though he doesn't know that,

26:06.477 --> 26:09.611
and I'd rather he not get
the satisfaction of finding out.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.048
I had no idea.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.963
Yeah, so you'll forgive me
if I'm not too keen

26:14.007 --> 26:16.052
on inviting my new son-in-law
to the family barbecue.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.838
I'm sorry.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.841
Look, from now on, we have got
to be on the same page,

26:21.884 --> 26:23.277
or this is not gonna work.

26:27.063 --> 26:30.023
Okay, T-minus five minutes
to showtime.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.502
Are you in position, Sam?

26:31.546 --> 26:33.809
Yes, but it's really hard
to see through this thing.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.071
What if I run into something?

26:35.115 --> 26:36.290
Oh, you'll be fine.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.813
What the hell is going on,
Fallon?

26:37.857 --> 26:39.423
We just heard a crazy rumor
about changes

26:39.467 --> 26:41.077
to the halftime show.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.167
Shouldn't you be at La Mirage
dealing with picketing workers?

26:44.211 --> 26:45.516
I know you did not do something

26:45.560 --> 26:47.040
I specifically asked you
not to do.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.998
Right?Well, it's basically
the same thing

26:49.042 --> 26:49.956
you guys had planned.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.218
Just a little bit flashier.

26:51.261 --> 26:52.872
You'll barely notice
the changes.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.918
Fallon, why does that man's
shirt say "pyrotechnics expert"?

26:55.962 --> 26:57.703
Well, I wasn't gonna hire
an amateur.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.705
Please tell me you did not
plan fireworks mid-game.

26:59.748 --> 27:01.663
Now I can't tell
if you want me to lie.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.231
Okay, you need
to call this off. Now.

27:11.586 --> 27:15.764
Blake Carrington Enterprises
expanded by about 800% today.

27:15.808 --> 27:17.374
Empire building
is hard work, but I'm

27:17.418 --> 27:19.072
starting to feel
like my old self again.

27:19.115 --> 27:20.682
Now I'm just waiting
on Corlent Media

27:20.726 --> 27:22.249
to get back to me
about a merger.

27:24.033 --> 27:27.210
Apparently, they're still
considering Fallon.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.345
Hey.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.694
What's going on in there?

27:32.738 --> 27:35.088
I don't understand why
you're attacking Fallon.

27:35.131 --> 27:36.437
Oh, so now
you're taking her side?

27:37.612 --> 27:39.353
Fallon likes to make me look
like a villain.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.398
Well, maybe you are.
You do it all the time.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.357
You manipulate the emotions
of others

27:43.400 --> 27:46.012
to serve your own selfish needs.

27:46.055 --> 27:48.579
Well, I'm starting to think this
crystal lady didn't do any good,

27:48.623 --> 27:50.973
because you're acting
very hostile.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.671
I saw Alexis today.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.586
Why would you subject yourself
to that screaming banshee?

27:55.630 --> 27:57.023
Because I needed to, Blake.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.155
I'm not ready to just move on.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.157
I thought we agreed not
to let her poison our lives.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.985
We did.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.031
But I can't stop wondering,

28:05.074 --> 28:07.033
if you had known it was Alexis,

28:07.076 --> 28:09.078
not Mack, who was responsible

28:09.122 --> 28:11.777
for the death
of our unborn child,

28:11.820 --> 28:14.214
would she have received
the same punishment?

28:16.129 --> 28:18.522
You can't torture yourself
with what-ifs.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.048
We both know the answer is "no."

28:22.091 --> 28:25.486
You won't do a damn thing
to punish that horrible woman,

28:25.529 --> 28:27.749
because you always
protect her.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.142
I just wish I knew why.

28:32.014 --> 28:34.147
Yes! Sam, it's working.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.410
Our website is getting loads
of traffic from Spain.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.152
Oh. Thank God.
No fireworks.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.023
Yep, we're all good.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.723
CULHANE:
Those are definitely fireworks.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.898
Give me that walkie, Fallon.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.334
You're gonna burn down
the damn field!

28:47.377 --> 28:49.249
Stop it!Give me the walkie!

28:49.292 --> 28:50.511
I can't understand
what you're saying.

28:50.554 --> 28:51.991
Give me the walkie!No!

28:52.034 --> 28:53.166
Go?

28:53.209 --> 28:54.123
You said "go," didn't you?

28:54.167 --> 28:55.603
Wait a minute.
Is that Sam?

28:57.474 --> 28:59.259
SAM:
Phil the Phoenix!Uh-oh.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.392
Sam?

29:04.133 --> 29:05.831
SAM:
Where is everyone?

29:05.874 --> 29:08.311
Sam, don't panic, but you are
ever-so-slightly on fire.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.313
What?! Do I stop, drop and roll?

29:10.357 --> 29:11.532
FALLON:
No, no, no, no, no.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.012
Just keep running
and get in front

29:13.055 --> 29:14.404
of the Fallon Unlimited sign.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.319
I'll send someone out
with a fire extinguisher.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.234
What is happening?!
Am I still on fire?

29:26.503 --> 29:29.115
WOMAN:
Whoa, look at the sign!

29:29.158 --> 29:32.335
MAN:
Does that say what I think
it says? Oh, no!

29:32.379 --> 29:33.423
Oh, that's unfortunate.

29:39.081 --> 29:39.952
This was really great.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.257
Thank you.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.651
It's really nice to have
a home-cooked meal.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.827
Though I'm not sure this is
gonna be home for much longer.

29:45.871 --> 29:46.915
What are you talking about?

29:47.960 --> 29:49.613
There's nothing
keeping me here.

29:49.657 --> 29:51.485
You know, Blake won't
speak to me, and...

29:51.528 --> 29:54.053
I've got no money
to my name.What about your mom?

29:54.096 --> 29:57.360
She has conditions
I'm not sure I can meet.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.623
So, you know, maybe it's
time for me to return

29:59.667 --> 30:02.191
to my life in
Montana as a vet.

30:02.235 --> 30:03.845
Oh, my God.
I had no idea you served.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.716
Ernarian.Oh.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.718
Right. Yeah, I did know that.

30:07.762 --> 30:10.852
Speaking as someone who recently
did what you're suggesting,

30:10.896 --> 30:13.246
I can promise that running away
doesn't fix anything.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.683
You do belong here, Adam.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.163
And then maybe you and I can get

30:17.206 --> 30:18.729
to know each other
a little better.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.516
You want one more?

30:22.559 --> 30:24.561
Yeah.Great.

30:35.746 --> 30:36.835
Oops.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.314
Well, you know what they say.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.403
There's no such thing
as bad press, right?

30:40.447 --> 30:42.362
They obviously
never saw this headline

30:42.405 --> 30:44.451
about the halftime show.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.018
Well, if you think
that's hostile,

30:46.061 --> 30:48.716
you should hear her talk
to her assistant. Crazy.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.283
This isn't funny, Sam.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.025
You send me here to the hotel
to deal with fake picketers,

30:53.068 --> 30:55.244
and then you help ruin
my halftime show?

30:55.288 --> 30:58.073
I mean, I'll be lucky
if I even have a job on Monday.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.597
It's Fallon. I'm telling you,
I don't know what it is,

31:00.641 --> 31:03.252
I don't know what she does
to me, but she's like a...

31:03.296 --> 31:04.427
a hypnotist.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.560
An evil hypnotist
with great clothes.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.301
Don't blame Fallon.
You're an adult.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.521
Well, does it help at all that
I feel somewhat humiliated?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.654
Oh, you mean a little
like how I felt this morning

31:13.697 --> 31:15.830
when you imploded at the mere
mention of the word "boyfriend"?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.876
I wouldn't say I imploded.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.355
You didn't exactly jump for joy.

31:19.399 --> 31:21.183
Sam,

31:21.227 --> 31:23.664
I really like you.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.840
A lot,
but I'm starting to wonder

31:25.884 --> 31:27.668
if you're intentionally
sabotaging our chances

31:27.711 --> 31:29.104
at a relationship.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.586
Can we please just go somewhere
and talk about this?

31:32.629 --> 31:34.762
I...I don't have
anything else to say.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.808
Fletcher...

31:40.811 --> 31:42.857
ADAM:
I hope you're happy.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.207
You successfully tricked me
into working with your husband.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.384
You poisoned him?!

31:48.428 --> 31:50.430
Okay, I can explain.I already know it was

31:50.473 --> 31:53.041
a symptom of your
misguided loyalty to Blake.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.869
Okay, good, 'cause I
really couldn't explain.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.958
What I don't know
is how my own flesh and blood

31:57.002 --> 31:58.829
could be so cruel.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.570
Uh, if I took a guess,

32:00.614 --> 32:02.137
it's probably in the genes.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.575
And I've done as much groveling
to Jeff as I can stomach.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.969
It is no longer
a question of apologizing, Adam.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.232
You're gonna have to prove
we can trust you.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.277
"We"?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.800
Jeff and I are a package deal.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.106
If you can't accept that,

32:14.149 --> 32:15.542
then I'm gonna be forced
to go along

32:15.585 --> 32:16.978
with Blake's decision
to kick you out of the loft.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.806
And I don't know that
you're ever gonna come back.

32:18.849 --> 32:19.807
Is that a threat?

32:19.850 --> 32:21.765
It's called parenting.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.681
And maybe if you
had had that growing up,

32:24.725 --> 32:27.467
you wouldn't be going around
poisoning decent people.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.079
All right, what do
you want me to do?

32:31.123 --> 32:33.125
Jeff won't listen
to a word I say.

32:34.865 --> 32:38.565
Depends on the words coming out
of your mouth, sweetheart.

32:38.608 --> 32:40.523
Do you realize how much
damage you've done, Fallon?

32:40.567 --> 32:42.090
Most people seemed
to think it was funny.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.613
You know what's not funny?

32:43.657 --> 32:46.007
Having to delay the second half
of a game an entire hour

32:46.051 --> 32:47.443
because the field is burned.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.444
Yeah, well, I'll pay for it.

32:48.488 --> 32:50.142
That's not the point, Fallon.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.622
The point is that I'm a fool
for allowing myself

32:52.666 --> 32:55.364
to be a casualty of the
Carrington infighting, again.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.105
I'm really sorry, okay?

32:57.149 --> 32:59.020
I know I went overboard.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.804
But I was just...

33:00.848 --> 33:03.372
I was trying to get out
of Blake's shadow.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.375
Yeah. Maybe you should ask
yourself why that even matters.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.986
But ask it somewhere else.

33:14.905 --> 33:17.691
Seriously?

33:17.734 --> 33:19.475
Did you not hear
a word I said?

33:19.519 --> 33:21.651
Please.
We only need five minutes.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.044
Get out of my house, Alexis.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.090
This arrangement
is about to be over.Jeff,

33:25.133 --> 33:28.615
for years, I have been trying
and failing to take down Blake.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.530
I have clawed,
crawled and begged,

33:30.573 --> 33:32.749
and I am sick
of fighting in the mud.

33:32.793 --> 33:35.535
You have given me my first
real chance at winning.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.276
But let's face
the facts.

33:37.319 --> 33:40.192
Blake is a powerful
and ruthless man,

33:40.235 --> 33:42.498
and we need all the help
that we can get.

33:42.542 --> 33:43.630
Yeah.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.023
Just not his.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.072
I know that you'll
never trust Adam.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.943
And I don't blame you.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.249
But why settle
for trust

33:54.293 --> 33:55.729
when you can have insurance?

33:58.688 --> 33:59.950
Just watch.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.611
My name is Adam Carrington.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.527
I want to confess
that I poisoned Jeff Colby

34:11.571 --> 34:13.877
with the intent
to make him sick,

34:13.921 --> 34:15.575
if not kill him.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.938
FALLON:
Hello, Daddy.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.505
Fallon, let me guess.

34:32.548 --> 34:35.856
Gonna blame me for that mess
of a halftime show somehow?

34:35.899 --> 34:38.032
No. I just want to make sure

34:38.076 --> 34:40.208
you understood
what's really going on here.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.993
You need to understand
that I am back in control,

34:43.037 --> 34:44.343
and nothing you

34:44.386 --> 34:46.519
or Alexis can say will
take that away from me.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.955
ALEXIS:
Control over what?

34:47.998 --> 34:50.000
You gave up control
a long time ago.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.441
ADAM: You've let us
take everything.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.660
You're pathetic,
Daddy.

34:57.704 --> 34:58.966
You know exactly

34:59.009 --> 35:00.315
when you lost
the reins,

35:00.359 --> 35:02.665
and you are
never getting them back.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.559
Lovely.
You're living in a hotel,

35:26.602 --> 35:27.951
eating from a buffet.

35:27.995 --> 35:28.952
Should I be
concerned?

35:28.996 --> 35:30.215
Why are you here again?

35:30.258 --> 35:31.868
I saw on TV
that you almost started

35:31.912 --> 35:33.696
another Spanish-American War.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.176
I came to check
that you're okay.

35:35.220 --> 35:36.873
I'll be fine.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.875
Also, I have no doubt

35:38.919 --> 35:40.877
that this is yet another
in a long line

35:40.921 --> 35:43.489
of Blake-induced episodes
for you.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.794
Let me guess.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.274
You're trying
to recruit me again.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.363
I'm trying to understand
why you continue

35:48.407 --> 35:51.149
to let your father
get under your skin.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.194
You're not
the forgotten Carrington.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.935
Oh, great.
So you read that article, too.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.632
The point is,

35:56.676 --> 35:59.026
if you want to see Blake get
what he deserves,

35:59.069 --> 36:00.810
then help me and my husband.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.291
Even Adam has been recruited
to our side.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.641
Okay, yeah, not an incentive.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.991
But you are right, Mom.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.080
I keep letting Blake
get under my skin.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.821
But joining whatever mod squad
you've thrown together

36:11.865 --> 36:13.258
isn't gonna solve that problem.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.347
But if you only knew
the next phase of our plan...

36:15.390 --> 36:16.739
No. Mom.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.393
I'm sorry,
but I can see my future,

36:18.437 --> 36:20.003
literally,
right in front of me.

36:21.309 --> 36:22.571
I'm talking about you.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.052
Yes, I got that.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.880
Look, I get

36:26.923 --> 36:29.883
that you enjoy having your life
defined by Blake's,

36:29.926 --> 36:31.711
but I cannot do it.

36:31.754 --> 36:35.889
I now realize the only person
I am competing against is me.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.065
And I cause myself
enough problems as it is

36:38.108 --> 36:39.066
without Blake's help.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.155
So, I am off.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.811
Please, feel free to charge
whatever you want to my room.

36:44.854 --> 36:46.247
My treat.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.554
You know I'm rich now, right?

36:48.597 --> 36:49.555
Yeah.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.947
For the moment.

36:54.690 --> 36:56.388
Hey.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.607
You look great in gym clothes.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.043
Duh.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.436
What are you doing here?

37:01.480 --> 37:03.090
I know I messed up.

37:03.133 --> 37:06.180
I think you were right
that there was a part of me

37:06.224 --> 37:07.660
sabotaging our shot
at a relationship.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.488
And the truth is that...

37:09.531 --> 37:12.665
it's scary to admit
how much I like you.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.015
I haven't liked anyone like
this in a long, long time.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.931
Sam...But I shouldn't have
acted the way I did

37:17.974 --> 37:19.585
when you said the
word "boyfriend."

37:19.628 --> 37:22.109
I guess I just felt that...

37:22.152 --> 37:24.764
I don't know, boyfriend is
one step closer to husband,

37:24.807 --> 37:26.679
which is one step
closer to divorce.

37:26.722 --> 37:29.116
Which I've already done.

37:29.159 --> 37:32.119
So I messed up.

37:32.162 --> 37:34.295
I'm sorry.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.123
You should've called me
before coming here.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.516
MAN:
Babe!

37:37.559 --> 37:39.169
Who you talking to?

37:39.213 --> 37:41.171
FLETCHER:
No one.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.173
Just some salesman.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.579
FALLON:
Knock, knock.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.845
Hey.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.152
I know I'm probably
the last person

38:05.195 --> 38:08.895
you'd like to see right now,
but I do have some good news.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.157
You invented a time machine

38:10.200 --> 38:11.811
so I can ban you
from yesterday's game?

38:11.854 --> 38:15.293
No. But I do love
that elusive Culhane humor.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.990
Let's chat.

38:17.033 --> 38:20.341
So, despite the halftime show
going a bit...

38:20.385 --> 38:22.256
off the rails yesterday,

38:22.300 --> 38:26.565
we did see a considerable spike
in our overseas subscriptions.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.741
I mean, not...
you know, not Spain,

38:28.784 --> 38:31.352
but other
European markets.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.789
You know, just centuries
of European rivalry

38:33.833 --> 38:35.574
and resentment
finally doing some good.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.097
Where is this going, Fallon?

38:37.140 --> 38:40.274
Well, Corlent was
so impressed by our numbers

38:40.318 --> 38:42.102
that they have decided

38:42.145 --> 38:44.017
to restart negotiations
for the merger,

38:44.060 --> 38:45.366
leaving Blake in the dust.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.325
Wake me up when this gets
to good news for me.

38:50.719 --> 38:54.332
It's an offer for the official
naming rights for the stadium.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.724
I figured
your team could use it.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.291
I thought you said
it was a giant waste of money.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.685
It's not a waste of money
if it's an investment in you.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.339
And just think
of it as gratuity

39:01.382 --> 39:03.123
for helping me realize
what I have to do.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.126
From here on out,

39:06.169 --> 39:08.694
I am no longer going to live

39:08.737 --> 39:11.697
in the shadow
of Blake Carrington.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.960
I think I owe you an apology.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.180
My therapist warned me

39:17.224 --> 39:19.269
that I may be at risk
of unleashing my anger

39:19.313 --> 39:21.184
on innocent bystanders.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.534
No, no, I owe you an apology.

39:22.577 --> 39:25.188
And I'm hardly innocent.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.582
You were right.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.497
I do protect Alexis,

39:29.541 --> 39:31.369
and I can't explain it.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.936
She's the mother
of your children.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.417
I know she's gonna be
a part of our life,

39:36.461 --> 39:38.854
no matter what we do.

39:38.898 --> 39:42.031
But anger just leads
to more anger.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.207
And I'm ready
to break the cycle.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.340
Me, too.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.214
I thought I needed to get
over my anger with Alexis

39:51.258 --> 39:52.781
by starting a new empire,

39:52.825 --> 39:55.393
but the truth is I lost
control over my life.

39:55.436 --> 39:57.525
And it started way before
the Mack situation.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.787
What do you mean?

39:58.831 --> 40:01.224
It started when I lost
Carrington Atlantic.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.444
That's when it
all went wrong.

40:03.488 --> 40:06.055
Since then, I've been
manipulated by Alexis,

40:06.099 --> 40:09.058
provoked by Fallon
and fooled by Adam.

40:09.102 --> 40:12.627
That was the moment
that I lost my grip.

40:12.671 --> 40:16.805
Carrington Atlantic
is my legacy,

40:16.849 --> 40:20.592
and it's time
it returned where it belongs.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.424
Jeff Colby.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.556
How many times
do I have to tell you?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.253
We're not selling.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.733
And who the
hell is this?

40:31.777 --> 40:33.735
Oh, this is
my wife.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.345
And my partner.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.695
We have something
that we think

40:36.738 --> 40:37.913
will change
your tune.

40:37.957 --> 40:39.306
JEFF:
Mm-hmm.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.701
DUSTIN: It's all there.
You don't have to count it.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.443
Now, how soon can we expect
the regulations to loosen?

40:45.486 --> 40:47.270
WOMAN:
Ideally, within a few months.

40:47.314 --> 40:48.837
But with the right donation,

40:48.881 --> 40:51.231
we could be talking weeks.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.234
Mm.Ooh, she quick, huh?

40:54.277 --> 40:55.453
Like a cat.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.933
Mm. That was Stephanie
Graham, wasn't it?

40:57.977 --> 41:01.197
Yeah.I think she works for the
Department of Natural Resources.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.851
That's right. Yeah,
when we first looked

41:02.895 --> 41:04.374
into your association
with her,

41:04.418 --> 41:06.812
we thought it was just
a little affair. But then,

41:06.855 --> 41:09.249
lucky for us, this is
so much worse, isn't it?

41:09.292 --> 41:11.817
I mean, doling out payouts
to a woman

41:11.860 --> 41:14.080
in charge of enforcing
environmental regulations?Mm-hmm.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.603
Mm.Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:15.647 --> 41:18.171
Getting caught won't be a
good look to the investors.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.172
Or-or the authorities.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.216
No.

41:21.261 --> 41:24.133
If I advise the board to sell,

41:24.177 --> 41:25.700
will you hand over
the recording?

41:27.876 --> 41:30.052
I think we can
discuss that.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.401
Yeah.

41:31.445 --> 41:33.055
We're gonna discuss that.
