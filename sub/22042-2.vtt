WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:02.346
- [Gordon] Tonight, on Hotel Hell,

00:02.346 --> 00:04.368
I'm in Longview, Washington
trying to save one

00:04.368 --> 00:06.871
of the Pacific North West's precious gems,

00:06.871 --> 00:09.347
which has been shamefully neglected.

00:09.347 --> 00:11.052
- Oh my gosh.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.513
- The wealthy hotel owner
has a drinking problem

00:13.513 --> 00:15.330
that is spiralling out of control.

00:16.537 --> 00:17.861
- They want to see the hotel owner jailed.

00:17.861 --> 00:20.657
- Phillip was arrested for DUI.

00:20.657 --> 00:22.178
(police siren)

00:22.178 --> 00:24.284
- [Gordon] 50 devoted staff are desperate

00:24.284 --> 00:25.243
to save their jobs.

00:25.243 --> 00:28.309
- We care about this place,
and we care about you,

00:28.309 --> 00:32.125
but a lot of us feel like you
don't give a damn about us.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.784
- You're calling your staff liars?

00:33.784 --> 00:34.889
- Yeah, I would call them fucking liars.

00:34.889 --> 00:36.609
- [Gordon] Can I get this
hotel back on the waggon

00:36.609 --> 00:38.593
before it's too late?

00:38.593 --> 00:41.287
(upbeat music)

01:04.772 --> 01:06.420
- Longview, Washington,

01:06.420 --> 01:08.756
voted one of America's prettiest towns

01:08.756 --> 01:12.895
is home to Pacific North West
jewel, the Monticello Hotel.

01:12.895 --> 01:15.304
Built in 1923 this historic building

01:15.304 --> 01:18.401
is current celebrating
its 90th anniversary.

01:18.401 --> 01:19.954
But unlike cheese and good wine,

01:19.954 --> 01:22.199
some things do not get better with age.

01:23.916 --> 01:25.199
- [Female Hotel Guest] Oh my gosh.

01:26.335 --> 01:27.379
- I'm Phillip Lovingfoss

01:27.379 --> 01:29.547
and I'm the owner of the Monticello Hotel.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.561
I've wanted to own the hotel
since I was eight years old.

01:32.561 --> 01:34.490
My mother worked here
when I was very young,

01:34.490 --> 01:36.773
and I remember all the cocktail waitresses

01:36.773 --> 01:39.839
and how beautiful they were
and wanted to be a part of it.

01:39.839 --> 01:40.923
- [Gordon] Some might say the story

01:40.923 --> 01:43.155
of how Phillip Lovingfoss
obtained the hotel

01:43.155 --> 01:44.781
is almost too good to be true.

01:44.781 --> 01:47.023
Others might call it a fairytale.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.608
- Phillip was a bartender here,

01:48.608 --> 01:51.913
he fell in love with the
owner Annabelle Juell.

01:51.913 --> 01:53.217
- I was in my early thirties

01:53.217 --> 01:55.490
when Annabelle and I first
started going together

01:55.490 --> 01:58.110
and she was in her mid sixties.

02:00.047 --> 02:01.141
- They were married,

02:01.141 --> 02:03.811
and when Annabelle passed away

02:03.811 --> 02:07.971
all of her assets were given to Phillip.

02:07.971 --> 02:10.185
- He inherited the Monticello Hotel.

02:12.935 --> 02:14.134
- [Gordon] With his inheritance,

02:14.134 --> 02:15.552
Phillip has been living the good life

02:15.552 --> 02:17.721
with his girlfriend and
general manager Ginger,

02:17.721 --> 02:20.306
who is also 30 years his senior.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.175
- TJ.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.882
- But despite the owner's fabulous wealth,

02:22.882 --> 02:24.915
the staff are underpaid.

02:24.915 --> 02:28.481
- I still make minimum wage
and I've been here 12 years.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.869
- Yeah, we're getting a new car.

02:30.869 --> 02:33.778
- Phillip flaunts his
wealth in front of us,

02:33.778 --> 02:35.582
don't flaunt it in our face

02:35.582 --> 02:39.117
when we're all wondering
do we put gas in the car

02:39.117 --> 02:41.599
or do we buy groceries.

02:41.599 --> 02:43.569
- This is fucking unreal.

02:43.569 --> 02:45.863
He's probably got
$150,000 worth of diamonds

02:45.863 --> 02:46.732
on his right arm,

02:46.732 --> 02:48.918
a ten carat diamond
ring on his left finger.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.128
He walked through the kitchen one day

02:50.128 --> 02:51.848
and somebody broke a glass,

02:51.848 --> 02:53.673
and he said "oh did I lose a stone?"

02:53.673 --> 02:56.833
I mean really, how fucking arrogant.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.129
- I wanna say fuck you.

03:00.034 --> 03:02.265
- While Phillip and Ginger have
been enjoying their wealth,

03:02.265 --> 03:05.018
the hotel has been terribly neglected.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.454
- Cigarette burns.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.682
- [Female Hotel Guest] Oh my gosh.

03:07.682 --> 03:08.911
- Even got some gum.

03:08.911 --> 03:11.358
- Seriously, that is so gross.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.099
- All the way down the
hall around the corner.

03:13.099 --> 03:16.873
Inside the beautiful
historic Monticello Hotel,

03:16.873 --> 03:18.426
there are only four suites

03:18.426 --> 03:21.858
and then there are countless
rooms stuffed with Phillip

03:21.858 --> 03:24.426
and Ginger's crap, instead of guests.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.061
- [Gordon] With only four
guest bedrooms available

03:27.061 --> 03:28.093
in the main hotel,

03:28.093 --> 03:29.907
most guests are unwittingly given rooms

03:29.907 --> 03:31.544
in the so called north wing,

03:31.544 --> 03:35.919
which is a characterless 1960's
shoe box motel next door.

03:35.919 --> 03:37.321
- I was hoping to stay in the hotel.

03:37.321 --> 03:39.198
- Don't really even feel
like staying here now.

03:39.198 --> 03:40.908
- [Gordon] And having
been ignored for years,

03:40.908 --> 03:43.254
the hotel is not generating
any new business,

03:43.254 --> 03:45.816
with a rapidly dwindling client base.

03:45.816 --> 03:48.655
- [Female Hotel Guest] Where's
Mary? She's not here with us.

03:48.655 --> 03:52.180
- [Gordon] This once glamorous
hotel has major problems.

03:52.180 --> 03:54.672
But Phillip's problem may be the biggest.

03:54.672 --> 03:58.210
- It is no big secret that Phillip drinks.

03:59.343 --> 04:00.772
- Phillip will come in here drunk.

04:00.772 --> 04:02.273
- Good job, you did a good job.

04:02.273 --> 04:04.119
- In front of all the staff

04:04.119 --> 04:05.943
and it's just an embarrassing mess.

04:07.814 --> 04:09.822
- And I think that Phillip could die

04:09.822 --> 04:11.369
if he doesn't stop drinking.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.889
It scares me.

04:13.889 --> 04:15.547
- [Gordon] The day before
I arrived in Longview,

04:15.547 --> 04:17.757
things reach crisis point.

04:17.757 --> 04:22.724
- I was pulled over, and
they charged me with a DUI.

04:23.788 --> 04:26.109
I was placed under arrest.

04:26.109 --> 04:28.091
They booked me in the Cowlitz County Jail

04:28.091 --> 04:31.073
and yesterday morning I was released.

04:31.073 --> 04:34.378
It's an unfortunate situation.

04:34.378 --> 04:36.621
Thank you, you guys have a good night.

04:36.621 --> 04:37.489
- Thank you.

04:37.489 --> 04:38.462
- [Gordon] This hotel, its staff,

04:38.462 --> 04:40.898
and the community deserve better.

04:41.969 --> 04:44.270
- Phil talked about closing it.

04:44.270 --> 04:47.172
If Gordon isn't able to
save this place for us,

04:47.172 --> 04:48.757
50 people will be out of jobs,

04:48.757 --> 04:51.228
and Phil will be on his
yacht in Seattle drunk.

04:51.228 --> 04:53.126
- Hey Nessa!

04:53.126 --> 04:56.723
- This place is a gem that
needs to be preserved.

04:56.723 --> 04:58.131
It's the heart of Longview.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.273
This town needs the Monticello.

05:04.828 --> 05:07.609
(upbeat music)

05:08.850 --> 05:11.997
- Gorgeous, that place is massive,

05:11.997 --> 05:13.845
and look at all those rooms for guests.

05:13.845 --> 05:16.576
Finally, somewhere nice to stay.

05:16.576 --> 05:19.298
I feel sorry for the
crappy motel next door.

05:19.298 --> 05:20.695
I'm amazed that place is still open,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.989
right next to a big
hotel like that, my god.

05:25.794 --> 05:27.574
Wow, look at those beautiful cars,

05:27.574 --> 05:29.381
there must be a car show on.

05:29.381 --> 05:32.856
Oh no, is somebody having
a laugh, Hotel Hell.

05:35.491 --> 05:37.639
Ladys Nite, who the fuck can't spell.

05:37.639 --> 05:38.963
Part Time Housekeeper,

05:38.963 --> 05:40.861
I can't think of anything
worse to advertise

05:40.861 --> 05:42.373
on the outside of your hotel.

05:45.147 --> 05:46.395
Morning.

05:46.395 --> 05:47.263
- Good morning.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.132
- First name is?
- Vanessa.

05:48.132 --> 05:49.703
- Vanessa, nice to see
you darling, Gordon.

05:49.703 --> 05:51.966
I see you're having a
classic car show today.

05:51.966 --> 05:54.583
- No, those all belong
to our owner, Phillip.

05:54.583 --> 05:55.766
- No, stop.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.263
- They do.

05:57.263 --> 05:58.201
- They belong to the owner?

05:58.201 --> 05:59.098
- Yes, they do.

05:59.098 --> 05:59.967
- What's with the plate,

05:59.967 --> 06:01.736
there's like Hotel Hell
on one of the plates?

06:01.736 --> 06:02.974
- Yes.

06:02.974 --> 06:04.001
- He did that for me?

06:04.001 --> 06:05.782
- I'm not sure if he did
it for you or for him.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.304
- Wow.

06:07.304 --> 06:10.276
- Jeff Dougie, employer
of the month, 2010.

06:10.276 --> 06:12.977
You know it's 2013.

06:12.977 --> 06:13.845
- I do, yes.

06:13.845 --> 06:14.749
- Are the staff that bad,

06:14.749 --> 06:17.742
there hasn't been a more
recent employee of the month?

06:17.742 --> 06:20.195
- Last I hear actually he was in jail.

06:21.099 --> 06:22.257
- Holy crap.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.967
- We have so many great employees,

06:23.967 --> 06:26.918
it's ridiculous that we're not
recognised more than we are.

06:26.918 --> 06:29.660
- Here's your card, and
here is your room code.

06:29.660 --> 06:30.810
You're in room 220.

06:30.810 --> 06:32.204
- Will you show me the way?

06:32.204 --> 06:33.779
- Oh sure if you'd like, shall we?

06:33.779 --> 06:34.647
- Please.

06:34.647 --> 06:35.572
- If you'll follow me.

06:35.572 --> 06:37.800
- I'll get that, we're going outside.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.669
- Yes.

06:38.669 --> 06:39.538
- Okay.

06:39.538 --> 06:40.406
- Just across here.

06:40.406 --> 06:41.954
- So you have to go out
to get back up again?

06:41.954 --> 06:42.822
- Yes.

06:45.115 --> 06:46.210
- And 220 right here.

06:48.387 --> 06:50.504
- But this is not the hotel.

06:50.504 --> 06:53.048
- This is our north wing motel.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.728
- Now why in the fuck would
I want to stay in here?

06:55.728 --> 06:57.010
- All we have available to rent

06:57.010 --> 06:59.130
in the hotel are four suites.

07:00.232 --> 07:02.099
- I'd rather stay in there next door.

07:02.099 --> 07:03.304
- Okay.

07:03.304 --> 07:04.173
- Than in this dump.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.041
- I'm sorry.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.906
- People want to stay in the hotel,

07:06.906 --> 07:08.678
they don't want to stay
in the cracker box.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.962
- Driving up here I didn't
expect to be put in a motel.

07:10.962 --> 07:13.217
- No I understand, and I am sorry.

07:15.091 --> 07:16.373
- All right, it's just right over here.

07:16.373 --> 07:17.698
- Thank you.

07:17.698 --> 07:18.566
- You're welcome.

07:18.566 --> 07:20.565
- Bloody hell, that sofa is hideous.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.995
Who would use a fucking
brown sofa like that?

07:24.016 --> 07:25.633
Oh my god it gets worse in here.

07:25.633 --> 07:26.957
This bed, is this antique?

07:26.957 --> 07:27.825
- No.

07:27.825 --> 07:29.637
The rooms are furnished
completely with stuff

07:29.637 --> 07:31.169
from Phillip and Ginger's home.

07:31.169 --> 07:33.307
- Oh dear, is the mattress from the house?

07:33.307 --> 07:34.176
- Yes.

07:34.176 --> 07:36.185
- You bring a mattress from
your house into your hotel?

07:36.185 --> 07:37.561
- I wouldn't.

07:37.561 --> 07:40.199
- They charge $250 a
night for that mattress.

07:40.199 --> 07:41.941
I don't even know what to say about it.

07:41.941 --> 07:45.152
When they get new stuff they
bring the old stuff here.

07:45.152 --> 07:47.717
- There's some storage rooms
that are full of old furniture.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.885
- Where are the storage
spaces, where is it?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.376
- Just down the hall.

07:52.649 --> 07:55.725
- Gees, it's like a
suite just full of crap.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.633
It's like a dumping ground.

07:57.633 --> 07:58.687
- There's more too.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.251
- Wow, you are kidding me.

08:00.251 --> 08:01.119
- I'm not.

08:01.119 --> 08:03.424
- Oh my god, look at this.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.923
- I wish I was kidding you.

08:05.923 --> 08:06.792
- This is insane.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.248
It's like a hoarder, just junk everywhere.

08:08.248 --> 08:09.499
I don't understand how the hotel owner

08:09.499 --> 08:11.731
would dump half their shit in hotel rooms

08:11.731 --> 08:12.599
and not rent them out.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.004
- Gordon was pretty appalled

08:14.004 --> 08:15.349
at the state of the storage rooms,

08:15.349 --> 08:16.947
how much crap there was in there.

08:16.947 --> 08:18.887
Just a big fucking waste.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.669
Okay.
- I appreciate it.

08:20.669 --> 08:22.043
- You're very welcome.
- Thank you.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.368
Wow this place is so disappointing.

08:24.368 --> 08:26.141
The biggest highlight
so far is the drive up.

08:26.141 --> 08:29.175
The minute you step
inside it's just, bizarre,

08:29.175 --> 08:30.437
I can't wait to meet the owner

08:30.437 --> 08:32.943
and find out what the hell
is going on in his head.

08:35.693 --> 08:38.474
(upbeat music)

08:42.345 --> 08:44.097
- I've just arrived at
the Monticello Hotel

08:44.097 --> 08:45.389
in Longview, Washington,

08:45.389 --> 08:48.017
and I'm shocked to discover
that there are four rooms

08:48.017 --> 08:49.665
for guests in this grand place,

08:49.665 --> 08:52.063
while others are being used for storage.

08:52.063 --> 08:56.390
Oh my god, it's like a
hoarder, just junk everywhere.

08:56.390 --> 08:58.632
I've got to meet the owner
and the general manager

08:58.632 --> 09:01.239
and figure out what else
is wrong with this place.

09:02.198 --> 09:03.293
- Nice to see you.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.837
- Very nice to see you, welcome
to the Monticello Hotel.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.058
- Thank you, what a gorgeous
place from the outside.

09:08.058 --> 09:08.927
- Gordon.

09:08.927 --> 09:09.795
- How are you?

09:09.795 --> 09:10.900
- Good.

09:10.900 --> 09:11.769
- So, you're Ginger?

09:11.769 --> 09:14.067
- Yes, this is my
significant other, Phillip.

09:15.962 --> 09:16.830
- There you go.

09:16.830 --> 09:17.891
- Is that true?

09:17.891 --> 09:18.759
- It's true.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.196
- Wow, look at that bling,
may I have a quick look,

09:21.196 --> 09:23.125
it looks like a super bowl ring, man.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.066
- Too heavy for me.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.401
- I thought there was a car fare here

09:28.401 --> 09:29.757
until someone told me they're yours.

09:29.757 --> 09:30.625
- They're mine.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.151
- Amazing.

09:32.151 --> 09:33.065
- Let's go into the lounge.

09:35.085 --> 09:36.712
- Did you always want to own a hotel?

09:36.712 --> 09:38.957
- Ever since I was a little
kid I wanted to own this hotel.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.893
- Serious? And what's
the building worth now?

09:40.893 --> 09:43.739
- Between probably $3 and $5 million.

09:43.739 --> 09:45.032
- It's extraordinary.

09:45.032 --> 09:45.901
- I inherited it.

09:45.901 --> 09:47.462
- All the estate?

09:47.462 --> 09:48.331
- Yes.

09:48.331 --> 09:49.224
- And if you don't mind me asking,

09:49.224 --> 09:51.345
what was that to the tune of?

09:51.345 --> 09:52.415
- $10 million.

09:52.415 --> 09:55.610
- Wow. Is the hotel making
money or losing money?

09:55.610 --> 09:57.170
- Its losing money, I've been carrying it.

09:57.170 --> 09:59.148
- How much are you losing?

09:59.148 --> 10:00.979
- $30 to $35,000 a month.

10:02.008 --> 10:04.771
- Losing? So $400,000 a year.

10:04.771 --> 10:05.929
- Yes.

10:05.929 --> 10:07.065
- That's insane.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.098
- There's lots of sleepless nights for me.

10:09.098 --> 10:10.495
- How are we losing so much money.

10:10.495 --> 10:12.633
- Being taken advantage of I know that.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.114
- Who's taking advantage?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.626
- The kitchen staff for sure.

10:16.512 --> 10:18.180
- They wait and bleed the clock.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.794
- To think that you're
going to get paid for hours

10:20.794 --> 10:23.054
that you're not working,
they can't do that to you.

10:23.054 --> 10:23.922
- I know.

10:23.922 --> 10:25.938
- I think Gordon is
gonna have difficulties

10:25.938 --> 10:27.220
with my employees.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.077
I don't see them as team players at all.

10:30.077 --> 10:32.528
- If this place was taken away,
what would it mean to you?

10:32.528 --> 10:34.108
- Devastating.

10:34.108 --> 10:36.104
- It would be equivalent to a death.

10:36.104 --> 10:36.973
- Oh gees.

10:36.973 --> 10:38.993
- I started here in 1973.

10:38.993 --> 10:41.631
This has been a huge part of my life.

10:41.631 --> 10:44.997
- Wow. Well that's given me
insight, let me tell you.

10:44.997 --> 10:47.059
Ginger, nice to see you, darling.

10:47.059 --> 10:47.928
- Very nice.

10:47.928 --> 10:48.796
- Likewise, thank you.

10:48.796 --> 10:49.665
- Thank you, thank you.

10:49.665 --> 10:50.533
- Excellent.

10:50.533 --> 10:51.402
- Gordon, welcome again.

10:51.402 --> 10:52.271
- Thank you so much.

10:52.271 --> 10:53.382
- [Gordon] It's terrible to
hear that Phillip and Ginger

10:53.382 --> 10:55.613
are being taken advantage
of by their staff,

10:55.613 --> 10:57.344
when they clearly care so much.

10:57.344 --> 11:00.441
I really hope I can help them
sort their employees out.

11:00.441 --> 11:01.310
- Oh hello.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.178
- Good evening.

11:02.178 --> 11:03.387
- How are you?

11:03.387 --> 11:04.255
- I'm fine. I'm Debbie.

11:04.255 --> 11:05.457
- Debbie, Gordon, nice to see you.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.219
- I have a table for you right over here.

11:07.219 --> 11:08.626
- Now how long have you been here?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.149
- I have been here 12 years.

11:10.149 --> 11:11.640
- Wow, seriously, 12 years.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.820
- Yes.

11:12.820 --> 11:14.466
- Right, what would you recommend?

11:14.466 --> 11:18.397
- I recommend our crab and artichoke dip.

11:18.397 --> 11:19.950
- Okay, let's go for one of those.

11:19.950 --> 11:21.097
- All right.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.682
- Phillip's triple tower.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.600
- Yes.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.715
- What's that?

11:24.715 --> 11:28.271
- It's a three tiered tower
of three different appetisers.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.284
- And his name big
enough on the menu there?

11:30.284 --> 11:32.869
Obviously suffering
from small man syndrome,

11:32.869 --> 11:33.860
let's go for that.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.824
And then the butternut
ravioli, let's try that.

11:36.824 --> 11:37.693
- All right.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.657
- Thanks Debbie, nice to see you.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.722
- So the appetisers first, please.

11:41.722 --> 11:42.806
- Okay.

11:42.806 --> 11:45.559
- Well, I'm feeling really
nervous about cooking for Gordon.

11:45.559 --> 11:47.259
It's all fucking froze together.

11:47.259 --> 11:50.783
Most of the food is
pre-packaged or canned or frozen

11:50.783 --> 11:52.045
because Ginger and Phillip

11:52.045 --> 11:53.932
are running this place like real misers.

11:53.932 --> 11:56.281
They pinch a penny on every corner.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.032
- This is our crab and artichoke dip,

12:00.032 --> 12:01.951
it's served with deep fried pitta bread.

12:01.951 --> 12:04.453
- And is it fresh crab or canned?

12:04.453 --> 12:06.476
- Frozen Chilean crab.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.706
- Frozen Chilean crab?

12:07.706 --> 12:08.575
- Correct.

12:09.761 --> 12:12.840
- Jesus Christ, fucking snot dip.

12:16.688 --> 12:18.227
I mean, it's like a dish ready

12:18.227 --> 12:22.137
for one of Phillip's
girlfriends, no teeth.

12:22.137 --> 12:23.118
- Oh god.

12:23.118 --> 12:25.995
- It's got a sour taste to
it, I don't know what it is.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.674
No, Jesus, thanks darling.

12:27.674 --> 12:28.561
- You're welcome.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.773
- He felt it tasted sour.

12:32.773 --> 12:35.227
- It's always got that taste
to me, I don't like it.

12:36.871 --> 12:39.137
- You are kidding me, afternoon tea?

12:40.395 --> 12:41.626
- This is the tower.

12:41.626 --> 12:42.494
- This is the tower.

12:42.494 --> 12:44.212
- Oh my god, holy mackerel,

12:44.212 --> 12:47.861
so, you know it looks like
something you should have

12:47.861 --> 12:49.905
in your fucking garden,
not in your restaurant.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.813
Are those shrimp, are they
fresh or are they frozen?

12:51.813 --> 12:52.974
- They're frozen.

12:52.974 --> 12:53.912
- They're frozen, damn.

12:58.538 --> 12:59.633
- Fucking disgusting.

13:01.098 --> 13:01.967
- And what's in here?

13:01.967 --> 13:04.016
- They're teriyaki beef tips.

13:05.441 --> 13:09.553
- Jesus, that sauce is
hideous, and that's just tough.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.461
Beef tips, its like beef chew.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.838
And that middle one is
another portion of snot dip.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.006
I'll skip that.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.518
- Well unfortunately, for the chef

13:19.518 --> 13:21.614
he doesn't get to dictate his own menu.

13:21.614 --> 13:25.065
- What? The chef doesn't
write his own menu?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.327
- He does not.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.286
- Let's move on, shall we?

13:27.286 --> 13:28.301
My god, careful.

13:29.444 --> 13:31.113
- So Phillip's dictating the menu,

13:31.113 --> 13:34.414
I suppose if his staff can't
be trusted to clock in and out,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.454
they can't be trusted to choose the food.

13:37.744 --> 13:39.246
- Feedback on that?

13:39.246 --> 13:42.520
- The meat is too tough,
the sauce tastes weird.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.421
He can tell it's not homemade.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.580
- Is this Ramsay's?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.872
- And it is, the meat is too tough,

13:50.872 --> 13:53.482
he's getting the full picture
and that's just what I wanted.

13:54.876 --> 13:55.745
- Right.

13:55.745 --> 13:56.899
- I feel very good about it.

13:56.899 --> 13:59.850
I am very disappointed with Dan's food.

13:59.850 --> 14:01.205
It's horrible.

14:01.205 --> 14:05.397
I just hope that Gordon sees
the problems with the staff.

14:05.397 --> 14:06.318
- Ravioli.

14:08.337 --> 14:12.310
- I'm dreading bringing this
dish out to him right now.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.728
The butternut ravioli.

14:13.728 --> 14:16.304
- Thank you. Who made the raviolis?

14:16.304 --> 14:18.828
- I don't know the name
of the manufacturer.

14:18.828 --> 14:19.734
- Manufacturer?

14:19.734 --> 14:20.603
- Correct.

14:20.603 --> 14:21.778
- So, the raviolis
aren't even made either?

14:21.778 --> 14:22.737
- They are not made here.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.147
- Oh Jesus.

14:24.147 --> 14:25.016
- They are packaged.

14:28.514 --> 14:31.381
- That's dreadful, like a
mouthful of sugar every time.

14:32.695 --> 14:36.407
Oh dear. Thank you darling. Wow.

14:36.407 --> 14:39.702
- Frozen crab, frozen
shrimp, pre-packaged ravioli,

14:39.702 --> 14:42.152
it's more like eating at
a badly run old folks home

14:42.152 --> 14:44.186
than a decent restaurant.

14:44.186 --> 14:45.883
- Obviously from a package.

14:45.883 --> 14:48.005
- We all knew that one was coming.

14:50.129 --> 14:51.318
- I think there's a better way

14:51.318 --> 14:52.830
that our kitchen can function

14:52.830 --> 14:54.477
than it's functioning right now.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.168
I see this blatant like what?

14:59.190 --> 15:01.839
- Tell me about Phillip's
management style.

15:01.839 --> 15:04.960
- Well when he's sober I get
along with him just fine.

15:06.250 --> 15:09.555
When he's drinking I
avoid him at all cost.

15:09.555 --> 15:11.703
- Does he drink a lot on site?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.571
- Yes, he does.

15:12.571 --> 15:13.440
- Oh wow.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.367
On a scale of one to ten
how bad is he drinking now?

15:15.367 --> 15:16.573
- A ten.

15:16.573 --> 15:17.442
- A ten?

15:17.442 --> 15:19.234
- This week he was arrested.

15:20.159 --> 15:21.028
- For what?

15:21.028 --> 15:22.578
- DUI.

15:22.578 --> 15:24.705
- You are fucking kidding me?

15:24.705 --> 15:26.103
- I'm not kidding.

15:26.103 --> 15:28.876
- Oh my god Monticello Hotel Owner Jailed.

15:28.876 --> 15:30.315
Jailed?

15:30.315 --> 15:32.463
- He was kept overnight, in jail.

15:32.463 --> 15:35.431
- Bloody hell, why would
he not tell me that,

15:35.431 --> 15:38.083
when it had just happened hours ago?

15:38.083 --> 15:39.314
- Phillip is in denial,

15:39.314 --> 15:43.453
he doesn't take responsibility
for his drinking problem,

15:43.453 --> 15:46.480
and I felt Gordon needed to know.

15:47.833 --> 15:51.412
- Oh shit. The truth is
starting to come out.

15:52.772 --> 15:55.104
Why don't you ask the chef to
come out to the dining room,

15:55.104 --> 15:58.679
I'd like to meet him, and bring
Phillip and Ginger as well.

15:58.679 --> 15:59.548
Thank you.

16:00.876 --> 16:05.221
- He would like to see you
all in the dining room.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.764
- Phew, I'm lost for words.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.610
Chef that was dreadful.

16:14.610 --> 16:16.528
I don't think anything was fresh.

16:16.528 --> 16:20.313
- It takes extra time
to do things homemade.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.325
- Yeah, naturally.

16:21.325 --> 16:22.576
- We're on a time restraint.

16:22.576 --> 16:23.444
- What?

16:23.444 --> 16:25.475
- Ask how many hours they
get in a week or whatever,

16:25.475 --> 16:26.872
and they have got to scrape for hours.

16:26.872 --> 16:29.190
My prep cooks gets 20 hours a week.

16:30.104 --> 16:32.315
- [Gordon] That's not enough
time to make fresh food,

16:32.315 --> 16:34.212
is that why all the food is frozen?

16:34.212 --> 16:36.788
- I mean I get cut carrots
or cut celery in the bag.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.510
I get the boiled eggs
in a bag, done, peeled.

16:40.510 --> 16:41.908
- You buy in boiled eggs?

16:41.908 --> 16:42.776
- Yes.

16:44.379 --> 16:49.592
- I played the safe card and
purchased most of it prepared.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.365
- You played the safe card?

16:51.365 --> 16:53.377
We can't even boil a fucking egg in here.

16:53.377 --> 16:56.151
- Phillip, if you care about
quality you need to pay people

16:56.151 --> 16:58.935
to prep fresh food, not buy it in.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.928
- There were time during
January and February

17:01.928 --> 17:03.700
where I would have 12 - 16 hours a week.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.569
- A week?

17:04.569 --> 17:05.782
- Yeah.

17:05.782 --> 17:07.867
- How do you survive? Three hours a day!

17:09.727 --> 17:11.011
- Not very well believe me.

17:11.011 --> 17:11.878
- Do you have a family?

17:11.878 --> 17:12.748
- Yes I do.

17:12.748 --> 17:13.616
- Dan?

17:13.616 --> 17:14.492
- Seven kids.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.192
- This is insane.

17:16.192 --> 17:19.508
You can't run this hotel like a miser.

17:19.508 --> 17:23.428
If I sold fucking three of those cars

17:23.428 --> 17:25.608
and put it into the
kitchen budget to function

17:25.608 --> 17:28.965
for the next 12 months,
the chefs can do their job.

17:28.965 --> 17:33.414
And speaking of cars, why
didn't you tell me about this?

17:42.635 --> 17:45.023
I'm at the Monticello Hotel
in Longview, Washington.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.828
Oh my god, I want to see
the hotel owner jailed.

17:47.828 --> 17:48.881
Jailed?

17:48.881 --> 17:50.716
And I've just discovered
that the hotel owner

17:50.716 --> 17:53.177
has a drinking problem
so bad that just one day

17:53.177 --> 17:56.047
before I arrived he was
arrested for drunk driving.

17:56.983 --> 17:59.120
Can I have a word with the owner, please?

17:59.120 --> 17:59.989
- Yes.

18:01.261 --> 18:03.816
- What is going on? Truthfully?

18:04.775 --> 18:07.569
- I don't know, Gordon.

18:07.569 --> 18:08.661
- Have you had a drink today?

18:08.661 --> 18:09.530
- No.

18:10.819 --> 18:11.688
- Yes, you have.

18:15.835 --> 18:20.725
Your staff tell me that you
have a drinking problem.

18:20.725 --> 18:21.594
- No.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.462
- And yet you've just been busted for DUI.

18:26.679 --> 18:29.612
Ginger, does your boyfriend
have a drinking problem?

18:30.641 --> 18:32.153
- He does like his libations.

18:33.978 --> 18:35.278
- I'm pissed off that
you couldn't even say,

18:35.278 --> 18:36.567
"Hey Gordon, can I have a word?"

18:36.567 --> 18:39.452
- Gordon, I fully intended to
have a conversation with you.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.854
- You're splashed all over the newspaper.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.520
- I'm aware of that.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.875
- Who owns this place?

18:45.875 --> 18:46.744
- Me.

18:46.744 --> 18:48.639
- So when are you going to step up?

18:48.639 --> 18:51.266
- I'm here Gordon, I'm engaged.

18:51.266 --> 18:55.315
- If you can't be honest
with yourself, you're fucked.

19:02.705 --> 19:04.509
- The facts are starting to become clear.

19:04.509 --> 19:07.293
The problem here isn't
the staff, it's the owner.

19:07.293 --> 19:09.920
- Do you have room service?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.234
- We do not.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.872
- No room service in a hotel this size,

19:13.872 --> 19:15.812
that's not the only unpleasant surprise.

19:15.812 --> 19:18.116
Guests check in, and
just like me they think

19:18.116 --> 19:20.222
they're gonna get a
room in an historic gem,

19:20.222 --> 19:22.877
but instead they're placed in the motel.

19:22.877 --> 19:23.746
- It's disgusting.

19:23.746 --> 19:24.989
- It is disgusting.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.478
I don't think I could shower in this.

19:26.478 --> 19:29.079
Do you want to pick it
out for a different room,

19:29.079 --> 19:29.948
this is awful.

19:31.317 --> 19:33.068
- [Dan] And the fettuccini
alfredos are ready.

19:33.068 --> 19:35.414
- [Gordon] And during dinner service,

19:35.414 --> 19:36.822
most of the guests are over the age of 70.

19:36.822 --> 19:38.167
There clearly hasn't been any buzz

19:38.167 --> 19:40.117
about this place in decades.

19:40.117 --> 19:41.709
- [Phillip] Yes, sir.

19:41.709 --> 19:42.578
- This is not prime rib,

19:42.578 --> 19:43.446
it should be a little moister
than that, shouldn't it?

19:43.446 --> 19:45.112
- Well, I can go and check

19:45.112 --> 19:46.843
and see if there's
another incut back there.

19:46.843 --> 19:48.118
- Dan?

19:48.118 --> 19:48.986
- [Dan] Yes.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.815
- Do we have another incut, a moist one?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.081
- [Dan] Please be juicy. It is.

19:54.767 --> 19:56.433
- Does Phillip normally do this?

19:56.433 --> 19:57.302
- No.

19:57.302 --> 19:58.782
- No, why all of a sudden is he involved?

20:00.296 --> 20:01.164
Because I'm here?

20:01.164 --> 20:02.296
- I'm sorry.

20:02.296 --> 20:03.443
- Strawberry daiquiri.

20:04.631 --> 20:07.655
- I can't believe Phillip
is putting on a show for me.

20:07.655 --> 20:09.000
Well, if you want to know the truth

20:09.000 --> 20:11.485
about a drinker ask the bartender.

20:12.691 --> 20:14.141
Grant, so what is going on tonight,

20:14.141 --> 20:15.632
it's like a comedy or errors here.

20:15.632 --> 20:16.747
- You're welcome.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.435
- Does Phillip normally help you out.

20:18.435 --> 20:19.303
- No.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.367
- No. What does Phillip
normally do at the hotel?

20:21.367 --> 20:23.577
- He does drink quite a bit.

20:23.577 --> 20:25.287
- Wow, and on average a day,

20:25.287 --> 20:26.716
how many drinks would you make a day?

20:26.716 --> 20:28.165
- During the day, sometimes four or five,

20:28.165 --> 20:30.313
and then it jumps into the evening,

20:30.313 --> 20:33.650
it could come up to seven - eight.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.734
- Jesus.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.215
- I had him come up with a new one.

20:36.215 --> 20:37.083
- Oh wow.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.571
- Wow, no wonder things are on the slide

20:38.571 --> 20:40.208
with Phillip drinking that much.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.972
I've got to get him to tell me the truth.

20:42.972 --> 20:46.840
This monstrous hotel has
been running rudderless,

20:46.840 --> 20:48.039
there's no one at the helm,

20:48.039 --> 20:50.156
and you're pretending
all of a sudden I'm busy,

20:50.156 --> 20:51.626
I'm expediting, I'm
lifting because I'm here.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.232
I just-

20:53.232 --> 20:54.769
- No, it's not because you're here.

20:54.769 --> 20:55.849
- You don't normally do this stuff.

20:55.849 --> 20:57.278
- This is what I normally do.

20:57.278 --> 20:58.560
- You're calling your staff liars?

20:58.560 --> 20:59.429
- I would say so,

20:59.429 --> 21:01.084
if they say that I'm not
out here helping them

21:01.084 --> 21:02.502
every time I walk in this building

21:02.502 --> 21:04.170
I would call them fucking liars.

21:05.321 --> 21:07.720
- Come on, be fucking honest with me.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.589
- I am.

21:08.589 --> 21:10.103
- Do you think I just can just
wave a fucking magic wand?

21:10.103 --> 21:10.972
- No.

21:10.972 --> 21:12.439
- When the place is run into the ground.

21:18.747 --> 21:20.248
With dinner service over.

21:20.248 --> 21:21.545
Two seconds.

21:21.545 --> 21:23.293
I'm gonna get Phillip
and his staff together

21:23.293 --> 21:25.066
so I can finally get to the truth.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.081
Is that normal, what I witnessed tonight,

21:30.081 --> 21:31.809
is Phillip always here?

21:31.809 --> 21:32.678
- No.

21:32.678 --> 21:34.909
- Does Phillip always expedite
the fucking hot plate?

21:34.909 --> 21:35.910
- No.
- No.

21:35.910 --> 21:37.703
- We need somebody to expedite.

21:37.703 --> 21:38.777
- We're under staffed

21:38.777 --> 21:41.405
and if we get busy then
we can't give good service

21:41.405 --> 21:43.272
and those people will not come back.

21:43.272 --> 21:45.013
A person can't shortcut like that.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.996
- No, look at the size of this place.

21:46.996 --> 21:47.953
The business is being strangled.

21:47.953 --> 21:48.822
- Yeah.

21:48.822 --> 21:50.821
- It's being strangled by the owner,

21:50.821 --> 21:52.729
why were you pretending?

21:52.729 --> 21:55.200
- I'm doing a good job of pretending then.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.535
This is what I do.

21:56.535 --> 21:58.161
- Every time you come in
here this is what you do?

21:58.161 --> 21:59.611
- I do not run down to your bar?

21:59.611 --> 22:01.269
- For the last couple of nights.

22:01.269 --> 22:04.754
- Let's talk about the
elephant in the room, shall we?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.988
- When Phillip's drinking,

22:11.988 --> 22:14.157
he behaves one or two different ways.

22:14.157 --> 22:19.370
Either he's jovial and likes
to giggle and have a good time

22:19.568 --> 22:22.571
or if finances are in arrears

22:22.571 --> 22:25.658
and we hear about how
much everything costs you,

22:25.658 --> 22:28.525
and you are gonna close
the doors, it's stressful.

22:28.525 --> 22:30.381
It's not easy to come to work

22:30.381 --> 22:33.561
with someone threatening us all the time

22:33.561 --> 22:35.334
that the doors are gonna be closed.

22:35.334 --> 22:37.065
Please don't look at me like that Phillip,

22:37.065 --> 22:39.338
because you do do this to us.

22:39.338 --> 22:40.276
- That's bullshit.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.518
- [Gordon] You need to hear the truth.

22:42.518 --> 22:45.344
- You have told us over
and over and over again

22:45.344 --> 22:47.023
that you're just gonna shut the doors.

22:47.023 --> 22:49.974
- I may have said that twice, twice,

22:49.974 --> 22:51.308
but to come in here regularly

22:51.308 --> 22:53.206
and say I'm gonna close the doors.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.885
- If we keep lying about shit

22:54.885 --> 22:56.751
and we keep covering up shit and whatever,

22:56.751 --> 22:58.680
then he ain't going to fucking help us.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.962
And here we go like this,

22:59.962 --> 23:02.424
like we've been going
for seven fucking years.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.863
- He's been known to walk behind the bar

23:03.863 --> 23:06.886
and fix himself drinks after
the staff cuts him off.

23:06.886 --> 23:07.755
- Phillip?

23:07.755 --> 23:08.933
- Yes.

23:08.933 --> 23:09.986
- Is that true?

23:11.422 --> 23:12.778
- That I don't know about.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.843
That I don't know about,

23:15.843 --> 23:18.148
I've gone behind the bar
and made my own drinks, yes.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.274
- So you're blacked out,

23:19.274 --> 23:21.808
you're that inebriated that
you've got no fucking idea

23:21.808 --> 23:23.142
that you're that far gone?

23:23.142 --> 23:25.321
- If he goes behind the bar
take the drink away from him,

23:25.321 --> 23:27.176
he cannot go back there and pour.

23:27.176 --> 23:28.045
- Why is he in there in the first place,

23:28.045 --> 23:30.155
why is he even in that
bar in the first place?

23:30.155 --> 23:31.974
- Why does his staff have to do that,

23:31.974 --> 23:32.843
to me it's hypocritical.

23:32.843 --> 23:35.311
You put out memos saying that
we can't drink in the bar,

23:35.311 --> 23:38.407
its hypocritical, Phillip
and we care about this place,

23:38.407 --> 23:40.305
and we care about you.

23:40.305 --> 23:43.861
But a lot of us feel like you
don't give a damn about us.

23:43.861 --> 23:46.134
- Why are you coming in
here to put your employees

23:46.134 --> 23:48.188
in a bad uncomfortable situation?

23:48.188 --> 23:49.435
- If it was up to me,

23:49.435 --> 23:50.774
I would say Phillip you
can't drink in here,

23:50.774 --> 23:52.369
because if something happens,

23:52.369 --> 23:54.225
you take out a family of four,

23:54.225 --> 23:56.926
they're coming after me and my family.

23:56.926 --> 23:59.533
And I don't have any
money to afford a lawyer,

23:59.533 --> 24:02.143
to keep me out of jail
for the rest of my life.

24:07.176 --> 24:08.406
- [Gordon] I'm at the Monticello Hotel

24:08.406 --> 24:09.699
in Longview, Washington

24:09.699 --> 24:11.514
where the staff are confronting the owner

24:11.514 --> 24:12.765
about his drinking problem.

24:12.765 --> 24:13.633
- If it was up to me,

24:13.633 --> 24:15.424
I'd say Phillip you can't drink in here,

24:15.424 --> 24:18.885
because if something happens,
you take out a family of four,

24:18.885 --> 24:21.586
they're coming after me and my family.

24:21.586 --> 24:24.224
And I don't have any
money to afford a lawyer

24:24.224 --> 24:26.678
to keep me out of jail
for the rest of my life.

24:27.717 --> 24:31.116
- They are telling you the truth
because they freaking care.

24:31.116 --> 24:33.431
Unfortunately, you're
not telling the truth

24:33.431 --> 24:36.445
and that's whey this
business is struggling.

24:36.445 --> 24:39.513
This ship is on a collision course.

24:41.304 --> 24:43.900
- Can I show you something
I think you should all see.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.789
Come with me.

24:50.485 --> 24:51.366
I think everybody has forgotten

24:51.366 --> 24:53.983
what it's like for guests
to stay in this hotel.

24:53.983 --> 24:56.774
Dan, April, how much is this room?

24:56.774 --> 24:59.058
- $250 a night Fridays and Saturdays,

24:59.058 --> 25:01.178
$180 the rest of the week.

25:01.178 --> 25:04.969
- Let me show you what $250
gets you at the Monticello.

25:04.969 --> 25:06.235
I'll turn the lights out.

25:07.403 --> 25:11.763
Can you see that, this blue
light shows up bodily fluids.

25:11.763 --> 25:13.091
That's exactly what you're seeing.

25:13.091 --> 25:14.723
- That's disgusting, I wouldn't
want to lay on that bed.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.547
- Where do these mattresses
come from Phillip?

25:16.547 --> 25:17.767
- The house in Arizona.

25:17.767 --> 25:18.654
- Your house?

25:18.654 --> 25:19.522
- Yes.

25:19.522 --> 25:20.391
- Wow.

25:20.391 --> 25:23.231
- Those two holes there,
that cigarette holes.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.100
- Uh oh.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.109
- Burns. Watch out.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.204
- It's everywhere, don't touch there.

25:27.204 --> 25:28.072
- Oh shit.

25:28.072 --> 25:30.384
- I was totally grossed
out when I'd seen that bed.

25:30.384 --> 25:31.351
It was sickening.

25:31.351 --> 25:34.506
- $250 to sleep in filth.

25:35.723 --> 25:37.222
Oh my god.

25:37.222 --> 25:39.699
Phillip's semen right
there, it is everywhere.

25:40.613 --> 25:43.908
Does that make anybody else feel sick,

25:43.908 --> 25:46.702
because right now I am fucking disgusted

25:46.702 --> 25:48.718
by this foul polluted bed.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.929
- I felt dirty. I'm a clean
person, it was disgusting.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.206
- I don't know why you're running a hotel.

25:58.144 --> 26:00.477
You're just ripping people off.

26:00.477 --> 26:03.094
If you don't care for the customers

26:03.094 --> 26:06.225
and you don't care for your
staff, who do you care for?

26:07.650 --> 26:09.308
- I care about my staff.

26:09.308 --> 26:11.717
- The first thing you said
to me when I arrived here,

26:11.717 --> 26:13.156
Phillip, what's the problem?

26:13.156 --> 26:14.657
Staff.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.889
They're bleeding the clock.

26:16.889 --> 26:17.757
- No way.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.476
- That's what you told me.

26:20.476 --> 26:21.936
- I've got half of it written down at home

26:21.936 --> 26:24.761
where I put at least
100 hours free in here.

26:24.761 --> 26:28.473
We will come in an hour, two
hours early, not punch in

26:28.473 --> 26:32.133
and then we will work late, to
get what we need to get done.

26:32.133 --> 26:33.739
- You have an estate to the tune

26:33.739 --> 26:36.291
of 10 fucking million dollars,

26:36.291 --> 26:40.246
and a chef that puts 100
hours in for nothing,

26:40.246 --> 26:41.497
or is he lying?

26:41.497 --> 26:44.401
- He's not lying, he's here all the time.

26:44.401 --> 26:45.967
- I'm surprised you guys are here.

26:45.967 --> 26:48.420
- I'm the only earner for my family,

26:48.420 --> 26:52.101
and I make $500 bucks every two weeks.

26:52.101 --> 26:53.752
- This is fucking crazy.

26:56.501 --> 26:59.108
And you rock up here with
a plate with Hotel Hell,

27:00.478 --> 27:01.834
what the fuck is going on?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.031
These guys are your bread and butter,

27:05.031 --> 27:06.668
your fucking backbone,

27:06.668 --> 27:09.149
but they're terrified
to tell you the truth.

27:09.149 --> 27:12.152
You can't keep on cutting
corners and humiliating them

27:12.152 --> 27:13.863
because they're the problem,

27:13.863 --> 27:16.730
the fact that it's not busy, look within.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.555
It starts from the fucking top.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.524
- Amen.

27:19.524 --> 27:20.393
- Yeah.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.139
- Could you just excuse me,

27:22.139 --> 27:25.398
and leave me in here on my
own with Phillip, thank you.

27:31.422 --> 27:33.570
Now can you fucking man up?

27:33.570 --> 27:35.791
- I don't have all the
answers Gordon, I'm trying.

27:35.791 --> 27:39.180
- Give me one fucking
answer, give me something.

27:39.180 --> 27:41.692
You're abusing your staff.

27:41.692 --> 27:43.955
What kind of message does it send to them

27:43.955 --> 27:46.979
when you fill the car
park with classic cars

27:46.979 --> 27:49.294
and they're fucking struggling?

27:49.294 --> 27:51.083
Do you think it's fair?

27:51.083 --> 27:51.952
- Do I think it's fair, no.

27:51.952 --> 27:54.437
- No. Do they deserve better?

27:55.550 --> 27:56.419
- Of course.

27:56.419 --> 27:58.084
- Why are you doing it?

27:58.084 --> 27:59.846
- I don't have an answer for that.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.091
I don't know why I'm doing that.

28:06.717 --> 28:09.439
- Get out Phillip, leave me alone.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.045
Get the fuck out of here.

28:12.035 --> 28:15.338
(bright upbeat music)

28:22.552 --> 28:23.421
That was rough.

28:23.421 --> 28:25.486
Sleeping in a tub is bloody uncomfortable,

28:25.486 --> 28:28.406
but it certainly beats sleeping
on that filthy mattress.

28:29.344 --> 28:30.356
Oh what?

28:34.128 --> 28:36.158
The staff have been as
honest as they can be,

28:36.158 --> 28:38.447
but they're all afraid
of losing their jobs.

28:38.447 --> 28:40.533
Both of you, come with me, please.

28:40.533 --> 28:42.764
It's time Phillip and
Ginger heard from the people

28:42.764 --> 28:45.590
who aren't afraid to tell them the truth.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.458
Good morning, everybody.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.581
- [All] Morning, morning.

28:48.985 --> 28:50.202
- Thank you so much for coming.

28:51.460 --> 28:54.255
Your guests are gonna give
you some honest feedback.

28:54.255 --> 28:55.881
- Our room was dirty.

28:55.881 --> 28:59.340
It looked like an animal was
killed and drug out the room,

28:59.340 --> 29:02.523
and the stain goes down the hall.

29:02.523 --> 29:05.529
- There is no thought to
the guest experience at all.

29:05.529 --> 29:08.136
You feel like you threw
your money down the drain.

29:09.019 --> 29:10.969
- I was so disappointed to know

29:10.969 --> 29:13.889
that I couldn't stay in a piece of history

29:13.889 --> 29:16.902
and got sent over to a motel.

29:16.902 --> 29:20.093
- I was shocked at the decor that I saw,

29:20.093 --> 29:22.180
it was just hideous.

29:22.180 --> 29:25.338
- It was brutal to hear
that many guests complain

29:25.338 --> 29:28.914
about a one night experience in the hotel.

29:28.914 --> 29:31.250
- It actually scares you
away when you see the marquee

29:31.250 --> 29:35.671
that says "Thur Ladys Nite and
Hiring Par Time Housekeeper"

29:35.671 --> 29:36.995
- You don't want to advertise

29:36.995 --> 29:39.362
that you're short on housekeeping.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.406
- Whose stupid idea was it to advertise

29:41.406 --> 29:43.575
for a part time housekeeper.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.139
- I guess it's my idea,

29:45.139 --> 29:46.421
I'll take the responsibility for that.

29:46.421 --> 29:47.464
- Thank you.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.822
- Can I ask you all one question,

29:50.822 --> 29:53.710
would you come back and stay
here, please raise your hands.

29:53.710 --> 29:54.578
- No, never.

29:54.578 --> 29:57.557
- Never? I appreciate your honesty.

29:57.557 --> 29:59.608
- Thank you, thanks.

29:59.608 --> 30:01.595
- You heard what the guests had to say.

30:01.595 --> 30:02.463
- I did.

30:02.463 --> 30:04.512
- Do me a favour, spend
a couple of minutes here

30:04.512 --> 30:07.995
looking at what you've
inherited and ask yourself,

30:07.995 --> 30:09.646
do you really want it enough,

30:10.550 --> 30:12.802
do you really care enough?

30:12.802 --> 30:14.181
- Yes, I do care.

30:15.212 --> 30:20.425
- I don't think you do.

30:21.498 --> 30:23.365
- Owner Phillip and
general manager, Ginger

30:23.365 --> 30:26.138
have just found out what
the guests really think

30:26.138 --> 30:28.526
about the Monticello Hotel.

30:28.526 --> 30:29.837
Would you come back and stay here?

30:29.837 --> 30:30.705
- No, never.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.792
I think Ginger has finally realised

30:33.792 --> 30:36.402
how much Phillip's drinking
is hurting the hotel.

30:38.244 --> 30:40.382
And now she's asked to speak to me alone.

30:41.856 --> 30:43.439
- It's been hard.

30:43.439 --> 30:47.347
Because it's deep, his
alcoholism is very deep.

30:47.347 --> 30:48.536
- I can see it's been hard.

30:48.536 --> 30:50.882
- I've reached out to my children,

30:50.882 --> 30:56.095
and they've all talked to him,
but it hasn't done any good.

30:56.474 --> 30:57.342
And it's getting worse.

30:57.342 --> 31:02.550
The stress on my end has been
where is he at, is he driving,

31:02.550 --> 31:05.261
is he gonna kill somebody,
is he gonna kill himself?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.201
- I just wish you'd me
the truth, that's all.

31:08.201 --> 31:12.135
- I am a private person,
and this has been very hard.

31:13.154 --> 31:17.033
It's hard to see someone
destroy themselves.

31:17.033 --> 31:20.307
I don't know if he realises how bad it is.

31:20.307 --> 31:22.229
It's been a very heavy burden on me.

31:24.332 --> 31:27.105
He's very ill, it's a terrible disease.

31:27.105 --> 31:30.025
- He's an ill man and you're
suffering the consequences.

31:32.788 --> 31:33.831
He needs help.

31:33.831 --> 31:35.082
- And that's the truth.

31:35.082 --> 31:36.813
- I'm gonna persuade him to get treatment.

31:36.813 --> 31:38.273
- Oh god, would you do that for me?

31:38.273 --> 31:41.487
- I will do that. I want
this place to work, okay?

31:42.964 --> 31:44.007
- Thank you.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.006
- Come here.

31:46.006 --> 31:46.874
- And I'm sorry.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.017
- I'm going to need the staff's help

31:53.017 --> 31:55.008
to get through to Phillip.

31:55.008 --> 31:56.124
- Come through guys.

31:56.124 --> 31:58.679
- Maybe together we can
break through his denial.

31:59.874 --> 32:03.058
- I'm gonna get Phillip in now,

32:03.058 --> 32:07.274
and I need you to get behind
agreeing that he needs help.

32:08.261 --> 32:12.004
I know it's hard, but
you're part of this change,

32:12.004 --> 32:14.820
and you stand up for
what you feel is right.

32:14.820 --> 32:17.468
- The staff needs him to show us

32:17.468 --> 32:20.190
that he's willing to make a change.

32:20.190 --> 32:23.217
I think he needs to become
honest with himself.

32:24.381 --> 32:29.595
- This hotel is at breaking
point, and you need help.

32:32.733 --> 32:33.787
Is there anyone else in this room

32:33.787 --> 32:36.112
that thinks that Phillip
needs help with his addiction,

32:36.112 --> 32:37.506
please raise your hand?

32:38.711 --> 32:43.369
- They're all here because each
and every one of them care,

32:43.369 --> 32:46.396
not just about the hotel, but about you.

32:47.279 --> 32:52.493
Ginger, you know how bad
the drinking problem is.

32:53.379 --> 32:54.248
- Yes, I do.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.666
I pour out bottles, I empty
them out, down the sink,

32:58.666 --> 33:01.575
because I love him and I hate
to see him destroy himself,

33:01.575 --> 33:04.112
and that's what it's been
like, it's been very hard.

33:05.641 --> 33:06.955
- If you could see it through our eyes,

33:06.955 --> 33:08.978
it's like night and day.

33:08.978 --> 33:11.679
If you're in the day you're
just, you're amazing Phillip.

33:11.679 --> 33:14.004
You talk to us with so much
respect and stuff like that

33:14.004 --> 33:16.194
and as soon as you start
drinking you can see

33:16.194 --> 33:18.529
that huge difference come over you.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.104
It's like a black cloud.

33:20.104 --> 33:21.984
We really care about you, Phillip.

33:23.221 --> 33:25.849
- I mean we're afraid for you

33:25.849 --> 33:29.154
because your rock bottom
isn't going to be like most

33:29.154 --> 33:30.833
because you have the
money to pay your way out.

33:30.833 --> 33:33.242
You have the money to do what you do.

33:33.242 --> 33:35.932
Your rock bottom is
going to be very serious,

33:35.932 --> 33:38.643
it's either going to kill
you or kill somebody else.

33:38.643 --> 33:39.728
I don't wanna see you die,

33:39.728 --> 33:42.595
and I don't wanna see you in
trouble and hurt somebody.

33:44.044 --> 33:46.547
You're very important,
your worth getting clean,

33:46.547 --> 33:48.236
you're so worth it.

33:48.236 --> 33:49.105
- Okay.

33:49.105 --> 33:51.232
- Phillip, will you get help?

33:54.862 --> 33:57.047
You cannot keep on hiding this.

33:57.047 --> 33:58.903
- I don't know what you
want me to say, Gordon.

33:58.903 --> 34:00.832
- What about what you want to say?

34:00.832 --> 34:03.223
- I'm not saying anything. We're done.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.614
- If the entire staff can't
get through to Phillip,

34:12.614 --> 34:15.429
maybe speaking to him alone
will help change his mind,

34:15.429 --> 34:16.483
he's got to get help,

34:16.483 --> 34:19.416
otherwise, this place
doesn't stand a chance.

34:23.177 --> 34:25.704
When are you gonna snap
inside and say fuck,

34:26.806 --> 34:27.995
I'm hitting rock bottom?

34:27.995 --> 34:31.196
- I've been in this position
for the past several years.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.063
- I'm sorry to hear that.

34:32.063 --> 34:34.545
Don't get upset. Don't get upset.

34:36.847 --> 34:38.400
- It's all part of it.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.203
- So what do you wanna do, Phillip?

34:42.514 --> 34:44.208
Are you ready to get help? Please.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.880
- I promise you. I'm definitely going.

34:50.777 --> 34:53.540
For my family, for my staff
I'm going into treatment.

34:54.674 --> 34:55.658
- I appreciate that. Come here.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.024
- It's time.

34:57.024 --> 34:59.495
- Some things in life are
more important than business

34:59.495 --> 35:01.184
and I'm glad Phillip has realised

35:01.184 --> 35:04.253
he has to put his health first
and sort out his problems.

35:06.698 --> 35:09.004
Coming up, welcome to the new

35:09.004 --> 35:10.916
and improved Monticello Hotel.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.461
Change is in the air at
the Monticello Hotel,

35:17.461 --> 35:20.349
so overnight my design team
give the hotel the makeover

35:20.349 --> 35:21.802
it truly deserves.

35:24.787 --> 35:25.655
- Good morning.

35:25.655 --> 35:26.678
- Good morning.

35:26.678 --> 35:29.684
- Welcome to the new and
improved Monticello Hotel.

35:31.297 --> 35:34.950
Before we go inside, I want
you to notice something.

35:36.302 --> 35:40.748
That dreadful motel sign has disappeared.

35:41.881 --> 35:43.414
When people want to make a booking,

35:43.414 --> 35:45.478
you can offer them a
choice of the modern annex

35:45.478 --> 35:46.990
or the historic hotel.

35:46.990 --> 35:47.991
And that will be a lot easier

35:47.991 --> 35:50.661
because I've opened up
four new suites for guests,

35:50.661 --> 35:54.352
doubling the number of rooms
in this historic hotel.

35:54.352 --> 35:58.041
- Oh yes. Let's go guys, come on in.

35:58.041 --> 35:58.909
- [Debbie] Let's do it.

35:58.909 --> 36:02.391
- I have butterflies, I am so
excited to walk in that hotel.

36:02.391 --> 36:04.466
- Come on, jump in ladies.

36:04.466 --> 36:05.425
- Boy oh boy.

36:05.425 --> 36:06.930
- [Gordon] Welcome to your new suite.

36:07.849 --> 36:08.717
Isn't it beautiful?

36:08.717 --> 36:09.586
- Wow.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.892
- [April] I love it, oh god.

36:12.401 --> 36:14.123
- This is a beautiful room

36:14.123 --> 36:16.864
that should be used for
guests, not storage.

36:16.864 --> 36:19.283
- Never in my wildest dreams

36:19.283 --> 36:23.391
did I think our storage unit
could end looking like this.

36:23.391 --> 36:25.122
- Are you ready to see the bedroom?

36:25.122 --> 36:28.156
- That's so cool. I don't even have words.

36:28.156 --> 36:30.252
- Gone is all that second hand furniture,

36:30.252 --> 36:33.120
replaced by a comfortable
bed with luxurious linens.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.299
Now we have something to be proud of.

36:35.299 --> 36:38.552
I mean the place is absolutely gorgeous.

36:38.552 --> 36:42.004
Stunning new furniture,
beautiful linens and beds

36:42.004 --> 36:43.463
for all your suites.

36:43.463 --> 36:44.610
- Very classy.

36:44.610 --> 36:48.176
It's mind blowing, what Gordon
has done is just phenomenal.

36:48.176 --> 36:49.615
- What do you think?

36:49.615 --> 36:50.950
- I think that this is a room

36:50.950 --> 36:52.848
that I can be proud to send my guests to.

36:52.848 --> 36:55.069
- Oh my goodness me, wonderful.

36:55.069 --> 36:56.289
- They're never gonna want to leave.

36:56.289 --> 36:57.967
- No.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.354
- I'd like to show you my room.

36:59.354 --> 37:04.568
- Oh my gosh, it's amazing.

37:04.964 --> 37:06.851
- For me the stunning interior

37:07.759 --> 37:10.178
matches the majestic exterior.

37:10.178 --> 37:11.252
Now you look from the outside

37:11.252 --> 37:14.463
you think this is exactly the
kind of feel you want inside.

37:14.463 --> 37:15.990
Have a quick look at the bedroom.

37:15.990 --> 37:17.580
This one you're going to love.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.230
- [Phillip] Oh boy.

37:20.606 --> 37:21.747
- And the bed.

37:21.747 --> 37:23.410
As you know with the
mattress full of stains,

37:23.410 --> 37:25.120
now look at that beautiful bed,

37:25.120 --> 37:27.820
that's what you call a
proper king size bed.

37:27.820 --> 37:30.959
- Oh wow, it was our best room before

37:30.959 --> 37:33.440
and now it's the best room in town.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.166
It's beautiful.

37:35.166 --> 37:39.342
- Come through guys. The
potential here is phenomenal.

37:39.342 --> 37:41.233
- It's the heart of the town again.

37:41.233 --> 37:42.505
- And something to be proud of.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.122
Oh, excuse me.

37:46.078 --> 37:49.616
Welcome to Monticello's
stunning new room service.

37:51.688 --> 37:53.064
How can a hotel of this standard

37:53.064 --> 37:56.026
not have a small dynamic
room service menu?

37:56.026 --> 37:57.736
It increases the turnover on every check,

37:57.736 --> 38:00.676
but more importantly
guests stay actually longer

38:00.676 --> 38:03.470
if they know the food is that
good in the room as well.

38:03.470 --> 38:06.532
Now get yourselves a
plate and start tasting.

38:06.532 --> 38:08.590
- [Vanessa] This is so good.

38:08.590 --> 38:09.998
- Those au gratin potatoes.

38:11.343 --> 38:13.011
- There's nothing like fresh salmon.

38:13.011 --> 38:14.826
That food was amazing.

38:14.826 --> 38:18.152
I can't recall the last
time I tasted food so fresh.

38:18.152 --> 38:19.914
- I think it's gonna be a real bonus.

38:19.914 --> 38:20.978
- Enjoy the rest of the food,

38:20.978 --> 38:22.437
we've got a big, big tonight ahead of us.

38:22.437 --> 38:23.908
- It's a really nice menu,

38:23.908 --> 38:26.181
I think it's gonna bring
the revenue higher,

38:26.181 --> 38:29.194
this is exactly what we needed.

38:29.194 --> 38:31.571
- This is sensational, beyond.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.232
- It's not just room service.

38:36.232 --> 38:38.745
I reinvented the menu
for the restaurant too,

38:38.745 --> 38:41.164
using the best local ingredients.

38:41.164 --> 38:43.323
I'm confident the
combination of great food

38:43.323 --> 38:45.314
and great rooms will encourage

38:45.314 --> 38:47.129
a whole new generation to come here.

38:47.129 --> 38:49.402
- That's medium in there, needs
about another minute or two,

38:49.402 --> 38:50.997
and then we'll pump that one out, okay?

38:50.997 --> 38:52.353
The difference between the frozen

38:52.353 --> 38:54.876
and the food we're
getting no, night and day.

38:54.876 --> 38:59.443
It is indescribable, from
the taste, the presentation,

38:59.443 --> 39:00.312
it's awesome.

39:00.312 --> 39:02.300
- Keep cooking with fresh ingredients.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.186
- I will.

39:03.186 --> 39:07.712
- And remember this, the day
a kitchen can't be bothered

39:07.712 --> 39:10.919
to boil a fucking egg
yeah, get out of there.

39:10.919 --> 39:12.066
Okay, you're better than that.

39:12.066 --> 39:13.367
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

39:13.367 --> 39:15.239
- Thank you.
- Well done, thank you.

39:15.239 --> 39:16.108
- Are you checking in?

39:16.108 --> 39:16.976
- Yes.

39:16.976 --> 39:17.845
- Can I get your name?

39:17.845 --> 39:19.056
- Sorrell.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.528
- Oh, you're staying in
one of our new suites.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.905
I can't wait for people
to see these rooms.

39:23.905 --> 39:24.823
- Oh, wow.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.543
- And I'm ecstatic,

39:26.543 --> 39:30.432
I'm gonna have so many less
guests out to the motel.

39:30.432 --> 39:33.021
- This is what I had hope for.

39:34.906 --> 39:37.262
- Although the guests are
delighted with the changes,

39:37.262 --> 39:39.486
it looks like Chef Dan has a problem.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.281
- A quick word.

39:41.281 --> 39:42.434
- What's wrong. Oh no you're leaving.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.608
- The Monticello's re-launch
is going brilliantly.

39:49.608 --> 39:50.765
Nice to see you.

39:50.765 --> 39:51.634
- Gordon.

39:51.634 --> 39:52.502
- Are you okay?

39:52.502 --> 39:54.561
- But Chef Dan has just pulled me aside.

39:54.561 --> 39:55.468
- No, let's go here.

39:55.468 --> 39:58.252
Take a seat, what's the matter?

39:58.252 --> 39:59.607
- Nine years clean and sober.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.693
- Wow, that's phenomenal. Well done.

40:01.693 --> 40:04.602
- So, I would love to be his
sponsors, Phillip's sponsor,

40:04.602 --> 40:07.052
if he would have be his
sponsor, once he gets out,

40:07.052 --> 40:09.253
he's going to need somebody by his side.

40:09.253 --> 40:10.869
- That's an amazing commitment.

40:12.652 --> 40:14.758
- It's a real big responsibility
to be Phillip's sponsor.

40:14.758 --> 40:17.261
I mean it's one I'm willing to take own

40:17.261 --> 40:18.762
and get our owner on the right track.

40:18.762 --> 40:20.917
- Yeah, good job, thank you.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.935
It's going to be a challenging
journey for Phillip,

40:24.935 --> 40:27.364
but with all the support he
has from Ginger and his staff,

40:27.364 --> 40:30.336
I'm hoping he'll be able
to stay away from alcohol.

40:30.336 --> 40:32.703
- So, when you get out of treatment

40:32.703 --> 40:33.798
you're going to need a sponsor,

40:33.798 --> 40:35.080
somebody to take you to meetings,

40:35.080 --> 40:38.229
so nine years, clean and sober.

40:38.229 --> 40:40.797
If you want my offer.

40:40.797 --> 40:42.911
- Thank you Dan, I appreciate that.

40:42.911 --> 40:44.162
- Sound good?
- It does.

40:44.162 --> 40:46.488
- Now with new life breathed
into the Monticello,

40:46.488 --> 40:48.458
it's time for me to go.

40:48.458 --> 40:52.515
- Both of you, take care
of yourselves, okay.

40:52.515 --> 40:53.383
Good luck.

40:53.383 --> 40:54.252
- Thank you, sir.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.226
- Seriously, good luck.

40:55.226 --> 40:58.358
Oh dear, next time I see you,

40:58.358 --> 40:59.376
you're going to be a changed man.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.418
- Oh yes, I will.

41:00.418 --> 41:01.930
- One more thing before I go,

41:02.994 --> 41:05.444
what makes this place very special

41:05.444 --> 41:08.322
is not just that it's a historic
building in its 90th year,

41:08.322 --> 41:09.605
for me it's the staff.

41:09.605 --> 41:14.818
So just so you don't forget
it, here we are, a new plague.

41:14.881 --> 41:15.749
- Wonderful.

41:15.749 --> 41:19.124
- And the employees of
the month this month

41:19.124 --> 41:20.866
are the entire staff.

41:20.866 --> 41:22.628
And you need to do more
than just recognise

41:22.628 --> 41:24.953
how good they are, you
need to pay them properly.

41:24.953 --> 41:25.822
- Yep.

41:25.822 --> 41:27.331
- Ramsey did a wonderful job.

41:27.331 --> 41:31.418
The hotel is flowing
in the right direction,

41:31.418 --> 41:34.338
because I do have a good crew
to turn the ship back around

41:34.338 --> 41:35.245
and make it thrive.

41:35.245 --> 41:38.623
And I'm going to seek
help for my drinking.

41:38.623 --> 41:39.614
- Thank you Gordon.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.065
(bright upbeat music)

41:43.065 --> 41:44.643
- Wow, what a place.

41:48.143 --> 41:50.281
I really hope Phillip keeps his promises.

41:51.375 --> 41:52.265
Time will tell.

41:56.151 --> 41:58.059
Since my visit to the Monticello Hotel,

41:58.059 --> 41:59.488
bookings have gone up.

41:59.488 --> 42:04.201
- This is really nice. Cosy?

42:04.201 --> 42:05.827
- [Gordon] And with all
the new revenue coming in,

42:05.827 --> 42:08.236
the staff are working with
a new sense of enthusiasm

42:08.236 --> 42:10.436
because Phillip is finally
paying them properly

42:10.436 --> 42:12.417
for all the hours they put in.

42:12.417 --> 42:14.419
- Gordon, I wanna thank
you for what you did.

42:14.419 --> 42:17.193
You saved 50 people's
jobs and their livelihoods

42:17.193 --> 42:18.184
and their families.

42:19.383 --> 42:21.468
- [Gordon] And Phillip is booked
into a treatment programme

42:21.468 --> 42:23.095
which starts next week.

42:23.095 --> 42:26.434
- All I can say for Gordon is,
God bless you and thank you.

42:59.329 --> 43:00.504
- [Voiceover] One Potato, Two Potato.

43:00.504 --> 43:02.053
- [Dan] Please be juicy.
