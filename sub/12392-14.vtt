[dish clatters]

00:19.680 --> 00:21.011
SHAWN.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.515
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME
FROM SCHOOL?

00:24.690 --> 00:25.645
UH...

00:25.690 --> 00:28.409
UH, WELL...

00:28.460 --> 00:31.827
AT THE ASSEMBLY TODAY,
THERE WAS A GUY.

00:31.860 --> 00:34.192
AND HE HYPNOTIZED
SOME STUDENTS.

00:34.230 --> 00:36.790
AND ONE OF THEM THOUGHT
HE WAS A KANGAROO.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.127
AND HE PUNCHED THE GUY.

00:38.170 --> 00:39.091
AND HE PASSED OUT

00:39.140 --> 00:41.199
BEFORE HE COULD PUT THE KIDS
BACK TO NORMAL.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.138
UH, BUT LUCKILY,

00:42.170 --> 00:45.059
MR. DETMER,
AN EX-NAW SEAL,

00:45.110 --> 00:46.008
PUT EVERYONE BACK

00:46.040 --> 00:49.498
BEFORE SIX KIDS HAD TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.439
LET ME SEE THE SUSPENSION NOTE
FROM THE TEACHER.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.141
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

00:54.180 --> 00:55.340
KID, I GOT A NICKNAME
AT WORK.

00:55.380 --> 00:56.847
IT'S "THE HUMAN LIE
DETECTOR."

00:56.890 --> 00:59.188
I SPEND MY DAY
ANALYZING LIES

00:59.220 --> 01:00.653
AND THE PEOPLE
WHO TELL THEM.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.385
RULE NUMBER ONE.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.388
EVERY LIE IS BUILT
ON A KERNEL OF TRUTH.

01:05.430 --> 01:08.194
TAKE YOUR LITTLE FIB,
FOR INSTANCE.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.527
IF I WERE TO PUT MONEY
ON IT,

01:09.570 --> 01:11.094
I'D SAY THE ONLY TRUE THING
THAT YOU JUST SAID

01:11.130 --> 01:13.792
IS THAT MR. DETMER
IS EX-NAW SEAL.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.296
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S AMAZING.

01:15.340 --> 01:16.568
NOT REALLY.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.100
THE RELATIVE SPECIFICITY
OF THAT STATEMENT

01:18.140 --> 01:20.370
COMPARED TO THE OTHERS
MADE IT OBVIOUS.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.446
[refrigerator door

01:22.480 --> 01:25.369
LOOK, SHAWN,
IF YOU CONTINUE

01:25.410 --> 01:27.241
TO LIE LIKE THIS,

01:27.280 --> 01:29.111
NOBODY'S GONNA BELIEVE YOU
WHEN IT COUNTS.

01:29.150 --> 01:31.209
AND THAT COULD PUT YOUR LIFE
ON THE LINE.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.151
LIKE MAYBE WHEN I
MIGHT BE A COP?

01:34.190 --> 01:36.249
NO. LIKE NOW.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.298
SHAWN SPENCER THRIVES
ON CLUTCH MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

01:43.430 --> 01:46.729
IT'S JUST HIM, THE BALL,
AND THE HOLE,

01:46.770 --> 01:48.658
SURROUNDED BY SILENCE.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.464
AND A MAN WEARING
A HEFI'Y BAG ON ANGEL DUST.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.535
COME ON, DUDE,
I WAS IN THE ZONE!

01:53.580 --> 01:56.674
NOW I HAVE TO START
ALL OVER.
[phone rings]

01:57.950 --> 02:00.771
(Gus)
SHAWN, THE FLOOR IS FLAT.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.448
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T
JUST PUTI' IN OUR OFFICE.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.414
BECAUSE, GUS, ANYONE CAN HIT
A BALL INTO AN EMPTY CUP.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.257
THE TRUE CHALLENGE
IS TO GUIDE THE BALL

02:08.290 --> 02:10.451
ALMOST MAGICALLY
THROUGH THE ORGANIZED CHAOS

02:10.490 --> 02:11.718
OF HUMAN BUSTLE

02:11.760 --> 02:13.921
AND INTO THE HOLE
AS IF NO ONE WERE THERE.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.518
LET'S JUST HOPE IT WORKS BETTER
THAN WHEN YOU ATTEMPTED

02:15.560 --> 02:16.822
THE SAME THING WITH THE DARTS.

02:16.870 --> 02:19.293
PARDON ME? I NAILED THAT.
30-FOOT BULL'S-EYE.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.693
NO. YOU HIT A GUY'S EYE.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.208
SHH.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.281
DUDE!

02:41.620 --> 02:42.621
STAY ALIVE.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.518
GET THERE.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.527
OH!

02:46.560 --> 02:47.527
HOW ABOUT MY PHONE CALL?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.266
YOU'LL GET
YOUR PHONE CALL.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.597
I DIDN'T DO IT.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.634
OH!

02:58.670 --> 02:59.773
WHO PUT A PUTTING GREEN
IN HERE?

02:59.810 --> 03:01.232
HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.475
I WAS TRYING
TO RESUSCITATE HIM.

03:03.510 --> 03:04.704
WAIT, WAIT, THAT GUY.

03:04.750 --> 03:05.944
THE ONE WITH THE GREAT HAIR.

03:05.980 --> 03:07.174
HE CAN VOUCH FOR ME.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.778
I THINK WE WORKED AT BUSCH
GARDENS TOGETHER ONE SUMMER.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.811
YEAH, WE MADE FUNNEL CAKES.

03:10.850 --> 03:11.817
OH, LOOK AT THAT, GUS.

03:11.850 --> 03:12.851
HE MUST'VE GO'ITEN ME
CONFUSED

03:12.890 --> 03:14.312
WITH ANOTHER MAN
WITH GREAT HAIR.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.282
AND THE WHITE GUY.
I KNOW HIM TOO.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.786
SAVE IT, RYAN.
HEY, REMEMBER--

03:17.830 --> 03:18.979
JUST SHUT UP.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.554
UH, JULES.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.296
WHAT'S THE STORY THERE?
YEAH.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.558
THAT'S RYAN BAINSWORTH,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.568
OR "LYIN' RYAN" AS WE CALL HIM
AROUND HERE.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.807
HE'S A COMPULSIVE LIAR
WHO IS NOTORIOUS

03:29.840 --> 03:31.660
FOR CALLING IN TIPS
AND SENDING THE DEPARTMENT

03:31.710 --> 03:33.337
ON WILD GOOSE CHASES.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.405
HE'S PRETTY MUCH
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ALL OF US.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.249
HOW CAN YOU TELL THAT SOMEONE'S
A COMPULSIVE LIAR?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.248
I MEAN, ASSUMING THAT
THEIR PANTS AREN'T ON FIRE?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.747
TRUST ME. WE KNOW.

03:40.780 --> 03:41.678
OH, COME ON, JULES.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.608
WE ALL TEND TO BEND THE TRUTH
JUST A LITTLE.

03:43.650 --> 03:45.584
NOT ME. MM-MM.
OH REALLY?

03:45.620 --> 03:46.552
DOES THIS RING A BELL?

03:46.590 --> 03:48.410
[high pitched voice]
NO, SHAWN, I HAVE NOT HAD

03:48.460 --> 03:50.348
ANY NAUGHTY DREAMS
ABOUT YOU.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.584
[normal voice]
AND...

03:51.630 --> 03:54.326
[high pitched voice]
YES, SHAWN, I DO WISH
GUS WAS NEVER BORN

03:54.360 --> 03:55.850
SO THAT I COULD BE
YOUR PARTNER.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.527
WHAT? THAT'S MESSED UP.
TRUE STORY.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.628
I NEVER SAID THAT, GUS.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.404
ANYWAY,
RYAN USUALLY COMES IN

04:02.440 --> 04:04.260
CLAIMING TO BE A WITNESS
TO A CRIME.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.631
BUT THIS TIME,
LOOKS LIKE HE'S COMMITTED ONE.

04:11.380 --> 04:12.870
OH, DETECTIVE O'HARA,

04:12.920 --> 04:13.875
THIS IS DR. MOREY,

04:13.920 --> 04:14.978
THE D.A.'S
PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERT.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.318
NICE TO MEET YOU.
HERE'S THE FILE ON OUR SUSPECT.

04:17.350 --> 04:18.988
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.317
DON'T MIND THEM.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.351
THEY'RE JUST HERE
TO OBSERVE.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.379
SHE'S RIGHT.
PLEASE CARRY ON.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.681
BUT WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,

04:24.730 --> 04:26.595
I'D APPRECIATE
IF YOU EVALUATE MY PARTNER GUS.

04:26.630 --> 04:28.723
FOR YEARS, HE'S
BEEN CLAIMING TO BE INSANE

04:28.760 --> 04:30.398
IN THE MEMBRANE.

04:31.630 --> 04:34.736
ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO US ALL A FAVOR

04:34.770 --> 04:36.362
AND WRITE DOWN IN NEAT
LITTLE LETTERS

04:36.410 --> 04:38.560
ALL ABOUT HOW YOU STABBED
AND MURDERED YOUR SUPER

04:38.610 --> 04:39.736
IN COLD BLOOD.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.079
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I'M INNOCENT.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.749
I HAD ASKED MY SUPER
TO FIX THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.475
I CLOGGED IT
WITH CINNAMON STICKS

04:47.520 --> 04:49.488
AND LEMON WEDGES
FROM A MARINADE.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.078
AI-TERWARDS, HE
WAS TO CHECK MY PIPES

04:51.120 --> 04:52.917
BECAUSE THE POLARITY
IS COMPLETELY OFF

04:52.960 --> 04:55.087
AND THE WATER
DRAINS COUNTERCLOCKWISE.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.429
BUT BY THE TIME
I GOT HOME,

04:57.460 --> 04:59.724
I FOUND HIM THERE...DEAD.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.058
DOCTOR, IF I CAN SPEAK
FOR YOU...

05:02.100 --> 05:04.694
I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.

05:04.730 --> 05:06.027
LOOK,
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL,

05:06.070 --> 05:07.492
I'D RATHER BE SCRAPBOOKING
RIGHT NOW.

05:07.540 --> 05:10.429
BUT THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.973
THOUGH I HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO MAKE A KICK-ASS COLLAGE.

05:13.010 --> 05:14.773
THEN MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL ME WHO DID KILL HIM.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.846
YES. AN ASSASSIN.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.847
AN ASSASSIN.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.677
A HIRED ASSASSIN.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.744
NO, TWO OF THEM, ACTUALLY.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.441
YES, YOU SEE,
THAT HAS TO BE IT.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.014
THE NIGHT BEFORE,
I WENT TO THIS RESTAURANT

05:24.050 --> 05:25.347
TO GET A BASKET
OF THESE THINGS

05:29.830 --> 05:31.127
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
WHERE THEY INJECT POTATOES

05:31.160 --> 05:32.821
WITH THE FOUR CHEESE MIXTURE,

05:32.860 --> 05:34.122
FRY THEM THREE QUARTERS
OF THE WAY,

05:34.160 --> 05:36.128
PULL THEM OUT, BATTER THEM,
FRY THEM AGAIN,

05:36.160 --> 05:38.867
AND THEN SERVE THEM WITH BACON
AND AN ANCHO CHILE SOUR CREAM.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.460
ANYWAY,
AS I WAS SITTING THERE,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.434
A CAR SPEEDS RIGHT THROUGH
THE STOREFRONT

05:43.470 --> 05:45.438
ACROSS THE STREET.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.836
IT MAKES SUCH A LOUD NOISE,
I HAD TO TURN MY HEAD AND LOOK.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.438
AND THAT IS WHEN I OVERHEARD

05:49.480 --> 05:51.505
THE GUY WITH THE CURLY-Q'S
ON HIS FACE

05:51.550 --> 05:53.768
TELL THE OTHER GUY
AT THE CORNER TABLE

05:53.820 --> 05:57.142
ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION PLOT.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.579
CAN IT BE TRUE?
NO WAY.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.655
I MEAN,
I--IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE?

06:00.690 --> 06:02.578
I COULDN'T IMAGINE.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.689
THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD PREPARE
A FRY LIKE THAT.

06:04.730 --> 06:05.719
THAT'D BE WAY TOO MUCH
FOR TH E--

06:05.760 --> 06:07.057
FOR THE HUMAN PALATE
TO MANAGE.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.398
IT WOULD BE
A FLAVOR SEIZURE.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.421
GENTLEMEN,
PLEASE DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

06:11.470 --> 06:12.539
SHE'S RIGHT.

06:12.570 --> 06:15.391
LET'S JUST TAKE A MINUTE HERE
TO THINK THINGS THROUGH.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.399
THEY MUST BE PARBOILING
THE POTATO FIRST.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.839
AN ASSASSINATION PLOT?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.677
SERIOUSLY, HOW GULLIBLE
DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

06:22.710 --> 06:25.702
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I'M 100% SURE ON THIS.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.775
I CLEARLY HEARD
ONE OF THEM SAY

06:27.820 --> 06:31.711
THAT THEY WERE GONNA KILL
SOMEONE WITH HIS BELT BUCKLE.

06:33.190 --> 06:34.612
RYAN, COME ON.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.423
THEY MUST'VE KNOWN
THAT I OVERHEARD THEM.

06:36.460 --> 06:38.428
THAT'S WHY THEY
WERE TRYING TO KILL ME.

06:38.460 --> 06:39.449
BUT THEY SURPRISED THE SUPER
IN MY APARTMENT,

06:39.500 --> 06:41.491
GOT HIM INSTEAD.

06:41.530 --> 06:42.497
AND--AND HE TRIED
TO STOP THEM.

06:42.530 --> 06:43.667
THEY KILLED HIM.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.430
HOW DID THEY KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU, HUH?

06:46.470 --> 06:48.563
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING
FOR THEM.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.603
I WAS ASKING AROUND,
PUTTING UP FLIERS.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.437
OH, FLIERS.
OH, WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE THEN.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.505
YOU ADVERTISED FOR KILLERS.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.905
(Ryan)
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.440
THESE ARE THE GUYS
THAT YOU WANT.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.471
IF YOU DON'T CATCH THEM,
SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA DIE.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.748
I SWEAR TO YOU.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.042
I HAVE A QUESTION.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.489
NO.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.339
IT'S NOT
A YES OR NO QUESTION.

07:05.390 --> 07:06.140
WHAT IS
THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT

07:06.190 --> 07:07.919
THAT SERVES
THESE ALLEGED FRIES

07:07.960 --> 07:10.781
AND MIGHT I SUBSTITUTE
A GARLIC LEMON AIOLI?

07:10.830 --> 07:12.127
SPENCER, OUT.

07:13.930 --> 07:17.058
OFFICER,
IF IT HELPS ANY,

07:17.100 --> 07:20.592
I THINK SUBSTITUTIONS
ARE ALLOWED.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.938
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DR. MOREY?

07:22.970 --> 07:24.961
WELL, HE SHOWS
ALL THE CLASSIC SIGNS

07:25.010 --> 07:27.808
OF AN UNDERLYING PATHOLOGY.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.899
PEOPLE LIKE THIS LIE
IN ORDER TO MAKE

07:29.950 --> 07:30.939
THEMSELVES VALUABLE.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.073
OVER TIME,

07:33.120 --> 07:34.178
WHEN PEOPLE STOP
BELIEVING THEIR LIES,

07:34.220 --> 07:34.970
THEY'RE FORCED TO ESCALATE

07:35.020 --> 07:36.248
THEIR BEHAVIOR IN ORDER
TO RECLAIM

07:36.280 --> 07:37.781
THE ATTENTION.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.583
COULD HE ESCALATE IT
TO THE POINT OF MURDER?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.629
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

07:42.660 --> 07:43.627
PLEASE.

07:43.660 --> 07:44.786
HIS POLICE HISTORY

07:44.830 --> 07:46.058
AND THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE

07:46.090 --> 07:48.058
OF HIS FINGERPRINTS
ON THE MURDER WEAPON

07:48.100 --> 07:50.728
AND THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
ON HIS HANDS...

07:50.770 --> 07:53.637
MM, YES, I THINK THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TO PROSECUTE HIM.

07:53.670 --> 07:54.762
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.097
WHY?

07:56.140 --> 07:59.576
BECAUSE LYIN' RYAN
IS TELLING THE TRUTH THIS TIME.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.100

08:40.650 --> 08:41.742
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

08:41.780 --> 08:43.748
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

08:43.790 --> 08:45.189
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

08:45.220 --> 08:48.257
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

08:48.290 --> 08:54.820
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

08:54.860 --> 08:56.828
AND YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT
TO TAKE ONE THE SBPD,

08:56.870 --> 08:58.861
AN EXPERT
IN FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY,

08:58.900 --> 08:59.935
AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.733
BECAUSE THEY ALL BELIEVE
HE'S GUILTY.

09:01.770 --> 09:02.862
I CERTAINLY
WANT TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.869
EVERY GOOD LIAR'S LIES
ARE ROOTED IN A KERNEL OF TRUTH.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.879
THIS ISN'T EVEN OUR CASE.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.969
ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW UP
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.113
IS THIS ABOUT PRIDE?

09:13.150 --> 09:15.345
GUS, I GOT THESE JEANS
AT A GARAGE.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.985
NOT A GARAGE SALE.
A GARAGE.

09:18.020 --> 09:20.955
CLEARLY PRIDE IS NOT AN ISSUE
FOR ME.

09:20.990 --> 09:23.686
THIS IS ABOUT ME
NOT WANTING A MAN

09:23.730 --> 09:24.754
TO BE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

09:24.790 --> 09:28.624
BECAUSE HE HAS A SICKNESS
THAT HE CANNOT CONTROL.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.161
PLUS, HE APPRECIATED MY HAIR.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.088
NO, HE APPRECIATED MY HAIR.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.939
HE WAS LYING.
HE'S A COMPULSIVE LIAR.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.130
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.296
COME ON.
TRY TO PLAY CATCH UP.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.602
UH, WHY DON'T YOU PLAY

09:37.640 --> 09:38.959
"INVESTIGATE THIS ON YOUR OWN"?

09:39.010 --> 09:40.375
FINE.

09:40.410 --> 09:43.800
STAY HERE, WASH THE DISHES
IN THOSE RIDICULOUS GLOVES.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.876
I'M GOING TO THE RESTAURANT
THAT HE SAID HAD CHEESE-INFUSED,

09:46.920 --> 09:48.979
TWICE-BATTERED FRIES.

09:49.020 --> 09:50.282
I'LL DRIVE.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.779
THE FRIES EXIST, SHAWN.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.923
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH
IN A BIG WAY.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.258
THEY'RE LIKE A PYRAMID
OF SAVORY GOODNESS.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.121
LET'S JUST SIT HERE
AND LOOK AT THEM FOR AWHILE.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.365
[sniffing]

10:07.400 --> 10:10.005
DUDE, THIS FEELS LIKE
A FAMILY ESTABLISHMENT,

10:10.040 --> 10:11.064
DOESN'T IT?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.361
I'M NOT SURE TWO RUTHLESS,
HIRED GUNMEN

10:12.410 --> 10:15.174
WOULD FREQUENT
A PLACE LIKE...

10:15.210 --> 10:18.145
(Ryan's voice)
A CAR SPEEDS RIGHT THROUGH
THE STOREFRONT WINDOW

10:18.180 --> 10:19.647
ACROSS THE STREET.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.318
THAT MADE ME TURN MY HEAD.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.716
THIS.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.980
UH, 'SCUSE US.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.089
UH-HUH.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.087
DO YOU REMEMBER
IF THERE WERE TWO

10:28.120 --> 10:30.156
THREATENING-LOOKING GUYS
SITTING AT THAT TABLE

10:30.190 --> 10:32.124
IN THE CORNER YESTERDAY?

10:32.160 --> 10:33.422
OH, MY GOSH. YES.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.098
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

10:35.130 --> 10:36.358
HE'S PSYCHIC.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.322
OH. OH.

10:38.370 --> 10:39.860
DO YOU DO PARTIES?

10:39.900 --> 10:40.992
PRIVATE ONES, YES.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.393
ARE YOU THINKING OF THROWING
A LITTLE SOMETHING TOGETHER

10:42.440 --> 10:43.702
FOR YOURSELF?

10:43.740 --> 10:44.809
OH, NO, MY NIECE,

10:44.840 --> 10:45.909
SHE'S TURNING SIX.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.077
NOT AVAILABLE FOR THAT.

10:47.110 --> 10:47.974
UH, DO YOU BY CHANCE

10:48.010 --> 10:49.944
REMEMBER OVERHEARING
ANYTHING THEY SAID?

10:49.980 --> 10:51.277
NO, THE ONLY THING
THEY SAID TO ME

10:51.310 --> 10:53.016
WAS WHEN THEY ORDERED.

10:53.050 --> 10:55.109
A BEER AND A CUP OF HOT WATER
WITH CINNAMON STICKS

10:55.150 --> 10:56.686
AND LEMON WEDGES.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.244
I CLOGGED IT
WITH CINNAMON STICKS

10:59.290 --> 11:01.212
AND LEMON WEDGES
FROM A MARINADE.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.282
BUT THEY
WERE TOTALLY CREEPY.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.026
SCARED THE HECK
OUT OF THE HOSTESS.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.099
YEAH, I SAW THOSE GUYS.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.859
DEFINITELY VERY CREEPY.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.460
THE ONE WITH THE WEIRD
HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.138
THAT IS WHEN I OVERHEARD
THE GUY

11:18.170 --> 11:20.070
WITH THE CURLY-Q'S
ON HIS FACE.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.135
HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE.
LIKE THE HAMBURGLAR?

11:22.180 --> 11:23.044
NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS MAYOR MCCHEESE.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.002
HE HAD THE 'STACHE.
'BURGLAR HAD THE MASK.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.745
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
THEN THERE WAS GRIMACE.

11:26.780 --> 11:27.940
THAT BROTHER WAS FUNNY.
WHAT?

11:27.980 --> 11:29.015
NO, NO, NO, NO.
EXCUSE US.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.779
I GAVE YOU VIN DIESEL.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.311
GAVE ME?
YOU'RE NOT CLAIMING GRIMACE
IS A BROTHER.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.782
GRIMACE IS A BROTHER.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.720
HE'S AN AMORPHOUS MASS.
HE'S LIKE A BIG AMOEBA.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.819
HE'S A BLACK AMOEBA,
SHAWN.
PURPLE.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.828
ANYWAY. ..

11:40.860 --> 11:42.088
WHEN I SEATED THEM,

11:42.130 --> 11:44.064
I SAW A BULGE
UNDER HIS SUIT JACKET,

11:44.100 --> 11:47.297
LIKE, FROM A GUN
ON HIS BELT.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.968
THEY WERE GONNA KILL SOMEONE
WITH HIS BELT BUCKLE.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.173
I THINK I'M STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND HOW RYAN WORKS.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.075
WHEN PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING
THEIR LIES,

11:55.110 --> 11:56.304
THEY'RE FORCED TO ESCALATE
THEIR BEHAVIOR

11:56.340 --> 11:58.274
IN ORDER TO RECLAIM
THE ATTENTION.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.414
SORRY. ANYTHING ELSE?

12:00.450 --> 12:03.214
NO. BUT YOU GUYS
SHOULD TALK TO CARL, THE VALET.

12:03.250 --> 12:05.115
HE HAD A REALLY WEIRD STORY.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.152
THANK YOU.
WHAT COLOR WAS GRIMACE?

12:08.190 --> 12:09.885
WHAT?
BLACK.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.483
YEAH, THOSE CREEPY DUDES.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.748
THEY WERE TALKING A LOT
ABOUT MONEY OR SOMETHIN'.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.018
THEN ONE OF THEM SLIPS
THE OTHER ONE A BAG OF CASH.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.822
BUT THEN THEY GIVE ME
A $.50 TIP.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.531
YOU KNOW,
IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF

12:20.570 --> 12:22.800
WHEN FOLKS ARE TOO CHEAP
TO EVEN SHELL OUT FOR A DOLLAR.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.864
I HEAR THAT.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.272
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.369
MR. SPENCER.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.217
MR. GUSTER.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.059
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:40.090 --> 12:42.456
WELL, CHIEF,
IF YOU MUST KNOW--
I MUST.

12:42.490 --> 12:43.923
WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK
WITH RYAN

12:43.960 --> 12:46.053
BECAUSE THE PSYCHIC BONE
IN THIS FINGER

12:46.090 --> 12:48.251
IS TELLING ME
THAT HE IS NOT LYING

12:48.300 --> 12:49.790
ABOUT THE HIT MEN,

12:49.830 --> 12:51.058
WHICH MEANS HE MAY
ALSO BE TELLING THE TRUTH

12:51.100 --> 12:52.522
ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION PLOT.

12:52.570 --> 12:53.935
AND IF WE
DON'T FOLLOW UP ON IT,

12:53.970 --> 12:55.232
EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS
PRETTY THIN,

12:55.270 --> 12:56.965
SOMEONE COULD DIE.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.034
WHAT?

12:58.070 --> 12:59.207
HA. I WILL.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.208
I WILL TELL HER THAT
BECAUSE IT'S SPOT ON.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.401
CHIEF, THAT IS
A VERY SMART PANTSUIT.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.475
I'M NOT HAVING A CONVERSATION
WITH YOUR PINKY.

13:05.510 --> 13:09.071
OKAY. ONE LAST QUESTION.
LOEHMANN'S OR TALBOTS?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.111
EVEN IF I DID BELIEVE YOU,
WHICH I DON'T,

13:11.150 --> 13:13.118
I HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD
WITH RYAN TOO MANY TIMES.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.118
NOW, UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME
CONCRETE PROOF OF SOMETHING,

13:16.160 --> 13:18.526
YOU AND YOUR PINKY
ARE BANNED FROM WASTING

13:18.560 --> 13:20.255
ANY DEPARTMENT RESOURCES
ON ANY INFORMATION

13:20.300 --> 13:22.860
COMING FROM RYAN BAINSWORTH.

13:22.900 --> 13:26.119
FAIR ENOUGH. WE WILL FIND YOU
SOMETHING CONCRETE.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.239
THANK YOU.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.008
GOOD NEWS,
WE HAVE AN INGENIOUS PLAN.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.302
INGENIOUS.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.171
HUH.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.145
SO MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO TURN
AND FACE ANOTHER DIRECT ION--

13:39.180 --> 13:42.069
PREFERABLY AWAY
FROM RYAN'S HOLDING CELL.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.111
YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING TO HIM.

13:44.150 --> 13:46.857
THIS IS NOT A CASE
FOR YOU.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.187
GO HOME.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.359
OH. US.
OH.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.322
WE SHOULD--
WE GO HOME.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.294
THANK YOU.

13:57.330 --> 14:00.094
NO, NO.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.266
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

14:06.210 --> 14:08.633
HIS NAME
WAS GRIMACE JACKSON, SHAWN.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.238
GRIMACE T. JACKSON.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.247
YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.372
WHATEVER.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.378
[gate shakes]

14:14.420 --> 14:15.910
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET
INTO RYAN'S APARTMENT

14:15.950 --> 14:17.315
TO CHECK IT OUT?

14:17.350 --> 14:19.238
FOLLOW MY LEAD.
[clears throat]

14:21.560 --> 14:23.027
HIYA.
HELLO.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.925
MAY I HELP YOU?

14:24.960 --> 14:27.258
PERHAPS. MY NAME
IS SHAWN SPENCER.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.518
I'M WITH THE BIG UNCLES
OF AMERICA PROGRAM.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.323
THIS IS
MY UNDERPRIVILEGED MENTEE,

14:31.370 --> 14:33.031
HOLLABACK ATCHA.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.230
HE'S SELLING MAGAZINE
SUBSCRIPTIONS

14:34.270 --> 14:36.431
AS A WAY TO LEARN
BUSINESS SKILLS.

14:36.470 --> 14:38.199
OTHERWISE HE'D BE FORCED
TO JOIN A GANG

14:38.240 --> 14:40.504
IF HE WAS STILL
ON THE STREETS.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.178
IF I WERE STILL OUT
ON THE STREET,

14:42.210 --> 14:44.144
I'D BE AN O.G.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.045
YOU WISH.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.945
[laughs]

14:47.980 --> 14:49.914
OKAY, JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE
I LET YOU IN.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.417
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.959
NOW WHAT EXACTLY
ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.353
EVIDENCE.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.589
EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE
THE STORY.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.140
CHECK IT OUT.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.442
LOOK AT THE WAY THE BLOOD'S
SPRAYED ALONG THE WALL.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.141
OH.
JUST LOOK.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.511
WHAT?
THE AORTIC SPATTER?

15:23.550 --> 15:25.279
SURE. IT MEANS THAT
THE SUPER'S AORTIC ARTERY

15:25.320 --> 15:26.617
WAS PUNCTURED
DURING THE MURDER.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.311
THE BUILT-UP BLOOD PRESSURE
CAUSES DIFFERENT--

15:28.360 --> 15:31.124
WOW.
SOME OF US LIKE
TO BE PREPARED, SHAWN.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.184
NO, NO.

15:32.230 --> 15:33.322
WHEN RYAN CAME
INTO THE STATION,

15:33.360 --> 15:34.327
HE ONLY HAD BLOOD
ON HIS HANDS.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.725
IF HE'D KILLED THE SUPER,

15:35.760 --> 15:38.399
WOULDN'T IT HAVE SPRAYED
ALL OVER HIS CLOTHES TOO?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.335
OH, NO!

15:43.370 --> 15:44.337
OH, MY GOSH! AH!

15:44.370 --> 15:46.258
OH...

15:49.340 --> 15:51.274
THAT MEANS THE SUPER
WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE

15:51.310 --> 15:53.574
AT THE REALLY, REALLY
WRONG TIME.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.019
THE ASSASSINS TOOK HIM OUT

15:55.050 --> 15:56.210
THINKING HE WAS RYAN.

15:56.250 --> 15:57.649
HOW'D THEY KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU, HUH?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.215
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING
FOR THEM.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.581
I WAS ASKING AROUND,
PUTTING UP FLIERS.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.180
THAT MEANS RYAN'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.458
WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE

16:06.490 --> 16:07.627
WITH A TARGET ON THEIR BACK.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.093
GUS, LOOK.

16:09.130 --> 16:10.324
[dramatic chord]

16:10.370 --> 16:12.326
RYAN REALLY DID WORK
AT BUSCH GARDENS.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.292
IS THAT WHAT HE THINKS
GOOD HAIR LOOKS LIKE?

16:14.340 --> 16:15.261
I THINK THAT'S KOKO B. WARE.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.437
SHAWN, COME ON.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.301
LOOK, HE'S LETTING RYAN
SHOULDER THE PARROT.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.205
WHERE WE GONNA FIND
THESE SO-CALLED ASSASSINS?

16:20.240 --> 16:21.275
MM-HMM-MM.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.278
BUT RYAN'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN HELP US FIND THEM.

16:23.310 --> 16:24.538
EVEN IF THEY DID EXIST,

16:24.580 --> 16:26.002
THE CHIEF WAS EMPHATIC
WHEN SHE SAID

16:26.050 --> 16:27.449
SHE DOES NOT WANT US
TALKING TO RYAN

16:27.480 --> 16:29.243
WHILE HE'S
IN POLICE CUSTODY.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.441
BINGO.
DON'T SAY BINGO.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.287
CRANIUM.
NOW I'LL PLAY
SOME CRANIUM.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.151
HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE
IN THE PSYCH SAVINGS ACCOUNT?

16:35.190 --> 16:36.748
I REALLY HATE
WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.490
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.365
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.628
DAPPER DAN.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.433
WE'RE JUST GONNA PAY A VISIT
TO OUR OLD BUDDY RYAN.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.563
YOU WERE GIVEN DIRECT ORDERS
TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.259
YEAH, WE DON'T TAKE
ORDENSOWELL'

16:52.310 --> 16:53.777
UNLESS THEY'RE TO GET
ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

16:53.810 --> 16:56.278
OR RAISE THE ROOF.
MAKE SOME NOIZE...
WITH A Z.

16:56.310 --> 16:59.438
YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST FORGET I ASKED, OKAY?

16:59.480 --> 17:02.574
WHAT IS IT, FIRST DAY
WITH THE NEW FEET?

17:02.620 --> 17:06.386
HE SPENT ALL DAY IN COURT
WAITING TO TESTIFY IN A CASE

17:06.420 --> 17:09.480
AND THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY
DIDN'T SHOW UP AGAIN.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.680
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.584
YOU GUYS CAN'T COMMUNICATE
WITH RYAN WHILE HE'S IN CUSTODY.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.427
I GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING
HE'S NO LONGER IN CUSTODY,

17:14.460 --> 17:18.328
SEEING AS HOW WE
JUST POSTED HIS BAIL.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.291
LOOKS LIKE PAPER.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.798
[high pitched voice]
ACTUALLY OUR LIFE SAVINGS.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.764
BYE-BYE.

17:26.110 --> 17:27.600
[door buzzer]

17:31.550 --> 17:33.415
HEY, YOU GUYS WANT LUNCH?

17:33.450 --> 17:35.509
YOU KNOW, I OWN
A RESTAURANT DOWNTOWN.

17:35.550 --> 17:36.778
ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT ALL MINE.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.617
I CO-OWN IT WITH MIKE DITKA.

17:38.650 --> 17:46.819
YOU GUYS EAT WILD GAME,
DON'T YA?

17:46.860 --> 17:47.827
ONCE WE FIND
THE REAL KILLERS,

17:47.860 --> 17:48.827
THE POLICE
WILL BELIEVE US.

17:48.860 --> 17:49.827
US? WHAT US?

17:49.860 --> 17:51.623
I'M NOT CONVINCED
YOU DIDN'T KILL THAT DUDE.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.661
BLOOD SPLATTER
IS A SUBJECTIVE SCIENCE.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.839
IT WAS THE ASSASSINS.
I'M TELLING YOU.

17:55.870 --> 17:58.202
AND IF WE DON'T STOP 'EM,
THEY'RE GONNA KILL AGAIN.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.309
I THINK RYAN HAS A POINT.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.034
IS THERE A KINKO'S NEARBY?

18:00.070 --> 18:01.332
WE SHOULD MAKE
SOME NEW FLIERS.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.268
WHAT INFORMATION
DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE?

18:03.310 --> 18:04.743
WELL, I-I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S ENOUGH,

18:04.780 --> 18:07.613
BUT I DID OVERHEAR
A TIME, A PLACE, AND A NAME.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.847
COME AGAIN.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.314
I KNOW WHO, WHAT,
AND WHERE.

18:12.350 --> 18:13.248
RYAN, THAT--THAT'S EVERYTHING
WE NEED TO KNOW.

18:13.290 --> 18:14.609
THAT'S ALL OF IT.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.718
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.227
BECAUSE NO ONE
WOULD LET ME.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.579
THAT'S TRUE.
GUS, THAT'S VERY TRUE.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.621
YEAH, I GOT THAT, SHAWN.
JUST GO AHEAD, RYAN.

18:20.660 --> 18:21.888
THE TIME WAS 10:00.

18:21.930 --> 18:23.727
10:00.
TO 4:30.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.260
10:00 TO 4:30.
YEAH.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.324
A SIX-HOUR WINDOW?

18:26.370 --> 18:28.292
WHAT, DO YOUR KILLERS WORK
AT THE CABLE COMPANY?

18:28.340 --> 18:29.329
IT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S THE PLACE?

18:29.370 --> 18:30.667
420.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.372
420 SOMETHING.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.332
I DIDN'T GET A STREET NAME
OR AN APARTMENT NUMBER,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.848
BUT THE ADDRESS DEFINITELY
HAS A 420 IN IT.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.144
HMM.
BUT THE NAME,
I HAVE.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.171
PERFECT.
WHAT IS IT?
TOM.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.188
TOM.
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
A LAST NAME, WOULD YOU?

18:44.220 --> 18:46.609
COME ON, GUYS, I CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

18:46.650 --> 18:48.652
OH, I'M TEACHING
A WATER AEROBICS CLASS

18:48.690 --> 18:49.657
IN 20 MINUTES.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.226
I-I GOTTA GO.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.750
GO? WE JUST BAILED YOU
OUT OF JAIL.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.519
RYAN, IT'S OKAY.
I TRUST YOU.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.595
DO YOUR THING.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.222
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW

18:58.500 --> 19:00.195
I WILL HAVE ONE OF MY ASSISTANTS
TRACK ME DOWN WHEREVER I AM.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.366
COUNT ON IT.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.209
OKAY...
DON'T WORRY, GUS.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.502
WE'LL TRAVEL FASTER
WITHOUT HIM.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.235
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
EVERY LIAR HAS A TELL.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.339
SO WHAT--
SURE, HE'S GOOD.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.369
BUT IF YOU LISTEN,
IT'S THERE.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.378
ALL RIGHT, WILL YOU--
STEP BACK INTO THE OFFICE.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.208
WILL YOU STOP--
OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA STOP
FOR TACOS ON THE WAY.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.615
THANK YOU.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.457
I'M SORRY, WHAT TIME
DO YOU CLOSE?

19:21.490 --> 19:22.252
WELL,
IF YOU'RE CLOSED ALREADY,

19:22.290 --> 19:23.757
WHY ARE YOU ANSWERING
THE PHONE?

19:23.790 --> 19:25.257
[line hangs up]

19:27.560 --> 19:29.721
DUDE, THE CLOCK IS TICKING
ON SOME GUY'S LIFE,

19:29.760 --> 19:31.364
AND YOU'RE OUT GETTING
A MILKSHAKE?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.539
GUS, DON'T BE THIS CREVICE
IN MY ARM.

19:33.570 --> 19:34.935
THIS ISN'T A MILKSHAKE.
IT'S A SMOOTHIE.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.335
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

19:36.370 --> 19:37.735
AND I WAS GOIN'
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

19:37.770 --> 19:38.805
CHECKIN' ALL THE PLACES
THAT ARE OPEN

19:38.840 --> 19:39.807
FROM 10:00 TO 4:30.

19:39.840 --> 19:40.909
AND BY BLIND LUCK,

19:40.940 --> 19:42.271
ONE OF THEM JUST HAPPENED

19:42.310 --> 19:43.948
TO BE THE ONLY JUICE BAR
IN SANTA BARBARA

19:43.980 --> 19:46.301
THAT OFFERS BLUEBERRIES
IN THE MIST

19:46.350 --> 19:47.772
WITH ACAI
AND GOJI BERRIES.

19:47.820 --> 19:48.718
I DIDN'T ORDER THAT.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.446
THIS IS THE NORMAL
BLUEBERRIES IN THE MIST.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.946
HOW DID YOU DO?

19:52.990 --> 19:54.685
I GOT A LIST OF ALL
THE ADDRESSES IN SANTA BARBARA

19:54.720 --> 19:56.415
THAT BEGIN WITH 420.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.826
THERE ARE OVER 700
POSSIBILITIES, SHAWN.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.624
420 1$T STREET.
420 2ND STREET.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.888
YOU GET THE DRII-T.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.295
WOW.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.958
I GUESS NEXT WE'LL HAVE
TO COMB THROUGH APARTMENTS

20:09.000 --> 20:10.467
AND SUITES TOO.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.966
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:12.010 --> 20:13.034
I'M SORRY, SHAWN,

20:13.070 --> 20:15.971
BUT I NEVER FULLY BELIEVED
RYAN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:16.010 --> 20:17.409
I WAS GOIN' ALONG
WITH YOUR GUT,

20:17.450 --> 20:18.474
AS USUAL.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.647
AND I HAVE A NON-NEGOTIABLE

20:19.680 --> 20:21.477
DISTANCE LIMIT
ON THOSE TRIPS.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.545
I HAVE A REAL JOB.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.239
WELL, UH--

20:25.290 --> 20:27.588
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU WOULD
RATHER SELL PHARMACEUTICALS

20:27.620 --> 20:29.485
THAN FOIL
AN ASSASSINATION PLOT

20:29.520 --> 20:31.681
AND CLEAR AN INNOCENT MAN
THAT'S BEEN ACCUSED OF MURDER?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.754
INNOCENT MAN?

20:32.790 --> 20:34.849
WE JUST TOOK ON THE WORLD'S
MOST UNRELIABLE CLIENT.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.391
I GET THE FEELING I'M GONNA NEED
ALL THE COMMISSIONS I CAN GET.

20:37.430 --> 20:39.466
I'LL BE SPENDIN'
THE NEXT SIX WEEKS PRAYING

20:39.500 --> 20:40.535
HE DOESN'T SKIP OUT
ON HIS HEARING

20:40.570 --> 20:42.265
SO WE CAN GET
OUR BAIL MONEY BACK.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.801
YOU CAN GET
BAIL MONEY BACK?

20:46.970 --> 20:49.336
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

20:49.380 --> 20:50.404
I DON'T KNOW.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.441
CALL THE HUMAN LIE DETECTOR.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.387
OKAY.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.455
RYAN, JUST, UH,

21:05.490 --> 21:07.629
JUST TELL HIM EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TOLD THE POLICE.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.697
OH, I KILLED THE SUPER
OF MY BUILDING.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.766
WHAT?

21:12.800 --> 21:14.495
THAT'S NOT--THAT'S NOT TRUE
AT ALL.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.996
WELL, THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT

21:16.040 --> 21:17.530
SEEMS TO THINK IT'S TRUE.

21:17.570 --> 21:18.832
OTHERWISE, WHY DID THEY
ARREST ME?

21:18.870 --> 21:20.428
(Henry)
SHAWN, IF THIS GUY

21:20.480 --> 21:21.538
SAYS THAT HE'S GUILTY,

21:21.580 --> 21:22.535
WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE?

21:22.580 --> 21:23.604
HE'S LYING.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.844
WAIT, HE'S LYING ABOUT LYING?

21:26.650 --> 21:28.971
I--RYAN, RYAN,

21:29.020 --> 21:30.487
TELL HIM ABOUT THE ASSASSINS.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.557
THE CREEPY ASSASSINS.

21:33.590 --> 21:34.750
WITH THE HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE

21:34.790 --> 21:36.382
AND THE PLOT
AND THE--

21:36.420 --> 21:37.523
AND THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE
WATER.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.527
PLEASE.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.857
ASSASSINS?

21:39.890 --> 21:41.528
COUNTERCLOCKWISE WATER?

21:41.560 --> 21:43.664
REALLY?

21:43.700 --> 21:45.065
SHAWN, IF I SAID THAT,

21:45.100 --> 21:46.829
I WOULD SOUND CRAZY.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.531
DUDE, YOU ARE CRAZY.

21:48.570 --> 21:50.458
YOU'RE--YOU'RE
WAY OFF THE RESERVATION.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.909
THAT'S WHY I'M
TRYING TO KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL.

21:51.940 --> 21:55.569
WHEN YOU LIE, DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL IMPORTANT?

21:55.610 --> 21:59.444
BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP LYING
THE WAY YOU DO,

21:59.480 --> 22:01.448
NO ONE WILL BELIEVE YOU
WHEN IT COUNTS.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.674
I WILL SLAP YOU
IN THE FACE.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.915
OH, VIOLENCE
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.679
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU ARE
THE SECOND MOST SANE PERSON

22:06.720 --> 22:08.756
IN THIS ROOM.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.883
RYAN, WOULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

22:10.930 --> 22:14.593
OH, YEAH.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.621
DON'T WANDER OFF.

22:17.930 --> 22:18.897
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.

22:18.930 --> 22:20.534
[sighs]

22:20.570 --> 22:22.367
WHY ARE YOU WORKIN'
SO HARD ON THIS ONE?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.537
I WORK HARD ON ALL MY CASES.

22:23.570 --> 22:24.605
I-I KNOW YOU DO.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.130
YOU WORK HARD TO HAVE FUN,
TO SHOW OFF.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.377
LOOK, I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.434
I KNOW THIS GUY'S
GOT A SCREW LOOSE.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.708
HE'S LYING OUT HIS ASS.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.001
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND

22:32.050 --> 22:33.711
IS WHY YOU'RE TAKING THIS ONE
SO SERIOUSLY.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.012
I GUESS BECAUSE NOBODY,
INCLUDING THE POLICE,

22:41.060 --> 22:42.516
BELIEVES IN HIM.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.152
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

22:44.190 --> 22:45.657
OH, REALLY?
YES, I DO.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.157
SHAWN, LISTEN TO ME.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.691
YOU ARE NOT RYAN.

22:48.730 --> 22:51.961
YEAH, YOU STRETCH THE TRUTH
A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.638
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
WHERE THE LINE IS.

22:53.670 --> 22:54.864
OF COURSE I KNOW WHERE
THE LINE IS.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.128
BUT ONLY
BECAUSE OF TWO THINGS.

22:56.170 --> 22:57.330
ONE--YOU ALWAYS
HAD SOMEBODY AROUND

22:57.370 --> 22:59.634
WHO KNEW WHEN YOU WERE LYING
AND BOTHERED TO CALL YOU ON IT.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.773
WHAT'S THE SECOND THING?

23:00.810 --> 23:02.698
WELL, I'D LIKE TO SAY
THAT YOU ALWAYS HAD

23:02.740 --> 23:06.005
ENOUGH NATURAL TALENT
TO FALL BACK ON.

23:07.780 --> 23:08.769
BUT I'D BE LYING.

23:08.820 --> 23:09.969
LISTEN TO ME, KID.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.578
IF YOU EVER DRAG MY ASS
DOWN HERE AGAIN

23:11.620 --> 23:12.848
TO DO GUSTER'S JOB...

23:14.190 --> 23:17.455
I'M GONNA HIT YOU UP
WITH A CONSULTING FEE.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.788
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT, CAPTAIN.
[clicks tongue]

23:22.700 --> 23:24.065
WHAT WAS THAT?

23:24.100 --> 23:27.160
THAT WAS ME
SAVING YOUR LIFE.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.428
FROM MY DAD?

23:28.470 --> 23:29.994
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
WE CAN TRUST.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.701
WE'VE GOTTA STAY LOW.

23:31.740 --> 23:35.039
LOW. I HAVE A FACE GUY

23:35.080 --> 23:36.206
WHO CAN DISGUISE US,

23:36.240 --> 23:37.400
GET US OUT OF THE COUNTRY
IF NEED BE.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.715
HE'S--YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY
GONNA HAVE TO BREAK YOUR NOSE.

23:40.750 --> 23:44.846
BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS WHAT
YOU SIGNED UP FOR.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.118
STOP IT!

23:46.150 --> 23:47.651
WHAT?

23:47.690 --> 23:49.908
THIS IS REAL.
YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.622
OKAY? EVEN BATMAN TAKES OFF
THE CAPE AND THE COWL

23:52.660 --> 23:54.150
WHEN HE'S IN THE BAT CAVE
WITH ALFRED.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.929
SO JUST...

23:55.960 --> 23:57.769
PRETEND LIKE I'M ALFRED

23:57.800 --> 24:01.759
AND YOU BE RYAN...

24:01.800 --> 24:03.734
WAYN E.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.658
[phone rings]
AH, IT'S THEM!
IT'S THEM! DON'T GET IT!

24:05.710 --> 24:07.132
HOLD ON.
DON'T!

24:09.110 --> 24:10.771
HELLO.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.243
SHAWN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M MAKING THIS CALL.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.840
BUT I FIGURED IT OUT.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.973
I'M STANDING
AT 420 MAIN STREET.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.647
AND GUESS WHAT IT IS?

24:18.690 --> 24:20.851
A HOSPITAL.

24:23.690 --> 24:25.055
SPENCER, WHAT THE HELL?

24:25.090 --> 24:26.079
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24:26.130 --> 24:27.085
YEAH, OF COURSE
I AM. WHY?

24:27.130 --> 24:28.097
WELL,
WE GOT THE MESSAGE

24:28.130 --> 24:29.097
THAT YOU WERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.

24:29.130 --> 24:30.563
SOMETHING ABOUT LIFE
AND DEATH.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.124
OH RIGHT. THAT.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.125
WELL, WE ARE IN A HOSPITAL.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.489
AND AS IT HAPPENS,

24:34.540 --> 24:35.666
IT'S FILLED WITH BOTH LIFE
AND DEATH.

24:35.700 --> 24:36.928
I KNEW I SHOULD'VE LEI-T
THAT MESSAGE.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.267
WHAT'S GOING ON, SPENCER?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.766
RYAN AND I SPENT
SOME QUALITY TIME

24:39.810 --> 24:41.004
IN A PSYCHIC SWEAT LODGE.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.429
TOWELED.
FULLY.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.572
AND I HAVE HAD A CLEAR VISION
OF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.

24:44.610 --> 24:48.512
THE TARGET OF THE ASSASSINATION
IS RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.586
HIS NAME IS TOM.
TOM LIEBER.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.780
AND HE NEEDS
POLICE PROTECTION.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.139
THIS MORE OF YOUR BULL CRAP,
BAINSWORTH?

24:53.190 --> 24:54.612
BECAUSE IN ADDITION
TO YOUR MURDER CHARGE,

24:54.660 --> 24:55.911
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO CHARGE YOU

24:55.960 --> 24:58.520
WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD
OF POLICE RESOURCES.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.754
YOU TOO AS WELL.

24:59.790 --> 25:00.552
MORE THAN ENOUGH GROUNDS.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.828
WAIT, NO, YOU HAVE
TO BELIEVE US.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.794
(man)
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.627
YOU'RE KILLING ME!

25:10.040 --> 25:11.029
FREEZE!

25:11.070 --> 25:12.105
[video game beeps]

25:12.140 --> 25:13.300
[video character dies]

25:13.340 --> 25:15.570
[game ends]

25:15.610 --> 25:17.305
PERFECT TIMING. I'M DEAD.

25:17.340 --> 25:28.148
THANKS A LOT.

25:28.190 --> 25:29.953
YOU. OUT.

25:29.990 --> 25:32.151
NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT ANYMORE.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.192
GET OUT.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.862
SPENCER,

25:38.900 --> 25:40.697
THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN
FOR COMPLETELY WASTING MY TIME.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.536
ONCE AGAIN?

25:41.570 --> 25:42.491
JUST LAST WEEK,
I GAVE YOU THE TIP

25:42.540 --> 25:44.804
ABOUT THE TWICE YEARLY SALE
AT T.J. MAXX.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.104
RACKS AND RACKS
OF $7 TIES.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.630
WASTING YOUR TIME?
I DON'T THINK SO.

25:48.680 --> 25:49.772
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

25:49.810 --> 25:51.107
IS THIS ABOUT THE ACCIDENT?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.845
BECAUSE I STILL
DON'T REMEMBER IT.

25:52.880 --> 25:53.949
WHAT ACCIDENT?

25:53.980 --> 25:55.117
I HIT A CAR.

25:55.150 --> 25:56.970
YOU MEAN, YOU WERE HIT
BY A CAR.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.146
NO, I HIT ONE.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.680
OR AT LEAST,
THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.482
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.750
WHY WOULD I EVEN
WANT TO HIT A BUICK?

26:02.790 --> 26:04.758
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
AGAINST BUICKS.

26:04.790 --> 26:05.984
CARLTON, LOOK AT THIS.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.653
SIR, ARE YOU SUFFERING
FROM AMNESIA?

26:09.700 --> 26:11.258
YEAH. MAYBE. ITHINK.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.790
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

26:12.830 --> 26:15.264
GREAT, LEAVE IT
TO LYIN' RYAN TO FIND

26:15.300 --> 26:17.165
THE ONLY AMNESIAC
IN SANTA BARBARA.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.805
ALTHOUGH I WON'T BE THE ONLY
AMNESIA PERSON MUCH LONGER.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.034
I'M GETTING MY MEMORY BACK.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.809
A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.273
LOOK, LIEBER.
TOM.

26:24.310 --> 26:25.641
I NEVER FORGOT THAT.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.170
HOW WONDERFUL FOR YOU.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.019
WE THINK YOU MAY BE
IN GRAVE DANGER.

26:29.050 --> 26:31.280
NO, WE DON'T.
YES, WE DO.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.118
THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM,
THE COOL SIDE--

26:34.160 --> 26:35.718
SORRY, JULES,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.648
THINK THAT [whispers].

26:37.690 --> 26:39.851
SOMEONE MAY BE TRYING
TO KILL YOU.

26:40.860 --> 26:41.827
ARE YOU BLACKMAILING
ANYONE?

26:41.860 --> 26:43.725
ARE YOU
HAVING A TORRID AFFAIR?

26:43.770 --> 26:45.021
ARE YOU--ARE YOU PART
OF TREADSTON E?

26:45.070 --> 26:47.391
WAIT, DON'T ANSWER
THE LAST QUESTION.

26:47.430 --> 26:48.761
OH, WOW, NO. NO.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.562
I-I WORK FROM HOME.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.067
RECEIVING AND PROCESSING
COMPLAINTS

26:51.110 --> 26:52.862
FOR A MATTRESS MANUFACTURER.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.777
ON TUESDAYS, I GO OUT
AND GET NEW GAMES.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.175
MAYBE THROW IN A TRIP
TO 7-11 FOR A GRAPE SLURPEE--

26:57.210 --> 26:58.848
WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN
WHERE I WAS GOING.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.814
OH, JUST Al-TER 6:00.

27:00.850 --> 27:02.715
ANAPAMU STREET.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.411
I WOULD'VE BEEN THERE
RIGHT AFTER THE...

27:04.450 --> 27:05.815
WHAT?

27:05.850 --> 27:08.216
MY GAMES...
ALL OVER THE STREET.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.818
HOW GREAT
WOULD THOSE HAVE BEEN

27:09.860 --> 27:11.088
DURING MY CONVALESCENCE?

27:11.130 --> 27:12.757
OKAY, THIS IS FASCINATING.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.792
SPENCER,
MAKE-BELIEVE TIME'S OVER.

27:14.830 --> 27:15.956
WE GOT REAL POLICE WORK
TO DO.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.865
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE STILL
A LONG WAY'S OFF

27:17.900 --> 27:19.265
FROM CONNECTING ANYONE
OTHER THAN RYAN

27:19.300 --> 27:21.336
TO THE MURDER OF THAT SUPER.

27:21.370 --> 27:23.838
[phone rings]

27:23.870 --> 27:25.030
HEY, CHIEF.
WHAT DO YA GOT?

27:25.070 --> 27:26.139
SHAWN.

27:26.170 --> 27:27.728
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

27:27.780 --> 27:29.133
RYAN LIED TO US AGAIN.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.943
HE MADE US LOOK
LIKE FOOLS AGAIN.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.948
AND NOW WE'RE STANDING
IN A ROOM WITH A GUY

27:32.980 --> 27:35.016
WHO LITERALLY KNOWS NOTHING.

27:36.420 --> 27:37.739
NO OFFENSE, TOM.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.916
NO. NONE TAKEN.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.918
VISITING HOURS ENDED
HOURS AGO.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.349
YOU GENTLEMEN NEED TO FINISH
YOUR BUSINESS NOW.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.278
OH, OUR BUSINESS
IS DEFINITELY FINISHED.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.456
TRUST ME.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.050
TOM, I DO HOPE
YOU REMEMBER STUFF.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.362
YEAH. NO, NO.
YOU'VE GOT IT.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.469
WE'LL BE THERE IN TEN.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.434
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU DIDN'T MAKE
DINNER RESERVATIONS

27:56.470 --> 27:57.437
AT SOUP PLANTATION.

27:57.470 --> 27:59.131
GUS AND I
HAVE ALREADY EATEN.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.330
THOUGH I SUPPOSE WE COULD GO
AROUND THE CORNER

28:00.370 --> 28:01.337
AND WATCH YOU EAT,

28:01.380 --> 28:02.335
IF YOU'D LIKE.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.075
THEY JUST FOUND A BODY
IN A VACANT OFFICE SUITE

28:04.110 --> 28:05.748
ON THE CORNER
OF GARDENER AND CARRILLO.

28:05.780 --> 28:06.849
REALLY. ANY I.D.?

28:06.880 --> 28:07.744
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

28:07.780 --> 28:09.213
IT IS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY
ON THE CASE

28:09.250 --> 28:10.945
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GIVE
TESTIMONY ON ALL WEEK.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.185
HUH. WHAT ABOUT
RYAN'S ASSASSINS?

28:13.220 --> 28:14.380
YOU SHOULD CALL
EITHER THE LOCH NESS MONSTER

28:14.420 --> 28:15.751
OR BIGFOOT IF YOU GET
IN TROUBLE.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.758
I'M SURE THEY'D BE HAPPY
TO HELP.

28:17.790 --> 28:20.156
FIRST OF ALL, BIGFOOT AND I
HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN FIVE YEARS.

28:20.190 --> 28:21.794
SIX, IF YOU DON'T COUNT
HIS COUSIN'S WEDDING.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.092
WHICH WAS LITERALLY, LIKE,
HEY, B.

28:23.130 --> 28:25.269
[growls]

28:25.300 --> 28:26.858
COME ON, JULES.
YOU KNOW ME.

28:26.900 --> 28:27.889
AND I KNOW PEOPLE.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.760
I CAN READ THEM.
YOU KNOW THAT.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.200
I'VE SPENT ENOUGH TIME WITH RYAN
TO KNOW WHEN HE'S LYING

28:32.240 --> 28:33.366
AND WHEN HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

28:33.410 --> 28:36.208
AND THERE IS A KERNEL OF TRUTH
IN EVERY ONE OF HIS STORIES.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.105
SO THEY CANNOT BE DISMISSED.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.505
NEITHER CAN HE.
HE'S A PERSON.

28:40.550 --> 28:44.486
A PERSON IS MORE THAN THE TALES
THAT THEY TELL.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.444
YEAH, WELL, RIGHT NOW,
HE'S MORE THAN JUST A PERSON.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.082
HE'S A DOCTOR.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.259
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY WE DOCTORS
HAVE A GOD COMPLEX.

28:51.290 --> 28:54.259
BUT AFTER SEVEN YEARS
OF NEUROSURGERY,

28:54.300 --> 28:56.894
I SAY WE HAVE A COMPLEX GOD.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.035
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
SPENCER.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.435
YOU KEEP UP
THIS LOSING STREAK,

29:02.470 --> 29:05.132
YOU WILL BECOME COMPLETELY
USELESS TO THE DEPARTMENT.

29:11.810 --> 29:13.914
I KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T EATEN.

29:13.950 --> 29:16.976
(Gus)
SHAWN, WE ARE TREADING
ON THIN ICE

29:17.020 --> 29:17.839
RIGHT NOW.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.039
YES, BUT I'M ABOUT TO DO
A DOUBLE AXEL

29:19.090 --> 29:21.979
INTO A SALCHOW AND FINISH
WITH A SWEET LITTLE CAMEL TOE.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.022
YOU MEAN CAMEL SPIN.
I'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS.

29:24.060 --> 29:25.220
I'M RIGHT
ABOUT THE RYAN THING.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.353
NO, YOU ARE OBSESSED
WITH THIS RYAN THING.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.154
AND, DUDE, IF YOUR PSYCHIC
POWERS DISAPPEAR,

29:30.200 --> 29:32.020
VICK WON'T NEED
TO HIRE US ANYMORE.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.025
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN SUBSIST

29:33.070 --> 29:34.162
ON THE PRIVATE JOBS
WE GET.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.861
HOW MANY TIMES
MUST WE GO THROUGH THIS?

29:35.900 --> 29:38.539
I AM THIS CLOSE TO GETTING
ON THE PRO BOWLERS TOUR.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.936
I AM NOT DOING THIS.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.072
OKAY, I GET IT.

29:42.110 --> 29:43.805
WE HAVE TO MAKE NICE
WITH THE CHIEF.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.579
WHY DO YOU THINK I BROUGHT
ALONG THIS PEACE OFFERING?

29:45.610 --> 29:47.043
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT ONE CONTAINER

29:47.080 --> 29:48.547
OF FRIES QUATRO QUESOS
DOS FRITOS

29:48.580 --> 29:49.877
IS GONNA FIX EVERYTHING?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.410
YES, I DO.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.017
THE LAWYER
HAD TWO SLUGS IN HIS CHEST.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.051
BALLISTICS IS CHECKING
THE SYSTEM FOR MATCHES.

29:57.090 --> 29:57.920
ANY TRACE?

29:57.960 --> 29:59.279
NOTHING YET.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.991
THE LAB'S GONNA CALL
THE SECOND THEY FIND ANYTHING.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.327
OH, NOT NOW, GENTLEMEN.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.260
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.165
AND DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU'VE BEEN WASTING

30:06.200 --> 30:07.224
MY DETECTIVES' TIME

30:07.270 --> 30:10.933
CHASING LEADS ONCE AGAIN
SUPPLIED BY RYAN BAINSWORTH.

30:10.970 --> 30:13.564
CHIEF.
CHIEF VICK.
HMM?

30:13.610 --> 30:16.374
CHIEF KAREN CHARLES VICK.

30:16.410 --> 30:18.571
HERE.

30:18.610 --> 30:19.941
OOH.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.548
IT'S A FRIES QUATRO
QUESOS DOS FRITOS.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.989
AND APPARENTLY
DOESN'T TRAVEL WELL.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.317
THE POINT IS,

30:27.350 --> 30:29.454
WE ARE SORRY FOR MAKING
LASSITER AND JULIET

30:29.490 --> 30:31.924
RUN AROUND TOWN
ON WILD GOOSE CHASES.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.222
SHAWN'S PSYCHIC POWERS

30:33.260 --> 30:35.125
HAVE BEEN A TAD
ON THE FRITZ.

30:35.160 --> 30:38.061
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY ARE BACK
TO 100% WORKING ORDER

30:38.100 --> 30:40.989
AND WE ARE FULLY AVAILABLE
TO HELP ON THIS MURDER CASE

30:41.040 --> 30:42.928
YOU ARE NOW ON.
EVEN MORE GOOD NEWS,

30:42.970 --> 30:44.267
THOSE TASTE BETTER
THAN THEY LOOK.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.504
(Gus)
YES, THEY DO.

30:45.540 --> 30:48.008
YEAH, FINE.
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.928
AND MY MIDDLE NAME
IS NOT CHARLES.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.107
I TOOK A SHOT.
I KNEW IT WAS A "C."

30:53.950 --> 30:56.111
NOW, ABOUT THIS DEFENSE
ATTORNEY'S MURDER CASE,

30:56.150 --> 30:59.119
ANY VICTIM
OF AN ASSASSINATION PLOT?
WOW. REALLY?

30:59.150 --> 31:00.640
AS ODD AS IT SOUNDS,

31:00.690 --> 31:02.988
IT ACTUALLY DID CROSS
MY MIND.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.055
SO I CHECKED IT OUT.

31:04.090 --> 31:05.125
AND I CAN SAY
WITH CERTAINTY

31:05.160 --> 31:06.627
THAT HE IS NOT THE VICTIM

31:06.660 --> 31:08.594
OF MR. BAINSWORTH'S
ASSASSINATION PLOT.

31:08.630 --> 31:11.064
THE CORONER PUTS TIME OF DEATH
AT FOUR DAYS AGO.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.169
AND A RECENTLY DISCOVERED
WITNESS

31:12.200 --> 31:15.590
WHO HEARD SHOTS AT 6:00
THAT EVENING CONFIRMS IT.

31:15.640 --> 31:17.392
WHICH MEANS THE LAWYER
WAS KILLED

31:17.440 --> 31:20.534
BEFORE RYAN ALLEGEDLY OVERHEARD
THESE MEN PLANNING A HIT.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.504
OUR VICTIM WOULD'VE ALREADY
BEEN DEAD AT THAT POINT.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.178
NO NEED TO KILL HIM AGAIN.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.041
UNLESS HE WAS A ZOMBIE.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.502
(policeman)
CHIEF.
YES.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.677
THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO
FROM THE BACK DOOR OF THE GARAGE

31:29.720 --> 31:31.017
NEAR THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
CAME IN.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.039
IT'S CORRUPTED.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.148
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF IT.

31:33.190 --> 31:34.680
HEY, ARE THOSE THE FRIES
QUATRO QUESO?

31:34.720 --> 31:35.982
YES, THEY ARE.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.578
HMM.
THEY DON'T TRAVEL WELL.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.258
(Chief Vick)
O'HARA, SET IT UP.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.257
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.658
[whispers]
WAIT.

31:46.700 --> 31:49.294
DUDE, SHE SAID THE LAWYER
DIED FOUR DAYS AGO.

31:49.340 --> 31:50.489
YES. IT'S OVER, SHAWN.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.167
FOUR DAYS AGO WAS TUESDAY.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.302
THAT MEANS THE LAWYER
GOT KILLED

31:53.340 --> 31:55.001
IN A BUILDING
ON GARDENER STREET

31:55.040 --> 31:56.371
ON THE SAME DAY
THAT LIEBER GOT HIT BY A CAR

31:56.410 --> 31:57.536
ON ANAPAMU.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.104
NOT JUST THE SAME DAY,
THE SAME TIME.

31:59.150 --> 32:00.572
AROUND 6:00 PM.

32:00.610 --> 32:02.146
AND THOSE STREETS
ARE ONLY TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.613
[whispers]
RYAN, THE LAWYER, LIEBER.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.345
THEY'RE ALL CONNECTED SOMEHOW.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.688
COME ON.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.085
* FRIES *

32:16.200 --> 32:17.189
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

32:17.230 --> 32:18.265
I JUST GOT A VERY STRONG VIBE

32:18.300 --> 32:20.063
THAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO APOLOGIZE TO US.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.330
IN WHAT WORLD WOULD WE
EVER APOLOGIZE TO YOU?

32:22.370 --> 32:24.531
WAYNE'S. MAYBE DAVE'S.
IT'S A SMALL...

32:24.570 --> 32:25.537
SPENCER.

32:25.570 --> 32:26.502
I BELIEVE THIS DVD
WILL PROVE

32:26.540 --> 32:28.337
THAT RYAN AND I
HAVE BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.743
[static hiss]

32:33.780 --> 32:35.111
[inhales]

32:35.150 --> 32:38.119
NOW, WHO'S THAT?
O'HARA, REWIND THAT.

32:47.490 --> 32:48.627
(Gus)
NO WAY.

32:48.660 --> 32:50.127
(Lassiter)
THAT'S TOM LIEBER.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.366
THAT'S THE KID
THAT BAINSWORTH LED US TO

32:51.400 --> 32:52.765
AT THE HOSPITAL, CHIEF.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.166
AND HE'S RUNNING AWAY
FROM WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.599
WELL, I GUESS

32:56.640 --> 32:59.063
YOU WERE RIGHT,
MR. SPENCER.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.236
LIEBER MUST'VE KILLED
THE LAWYER

33:00.270 --> 33:01.237
AND THEN GOT HIT
BY THE CAR

33:01.280 --> 33:02.372
AS HE FLED THE SCENE.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.434
OOH, UH, I DON'T KNOW.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.698
THE SPIRITS ARE A LITTLE
CLOUDY ON THAT PART, CHIEF.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.172
I'M SORRY FOR THE SPIRITS,

33:07.210 --> 33:08.416
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR GRAY AREAS.

33:08.450 --> 33:11.180
DETECT IVES, I WANT YOU TO GET
TO THAT HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.381
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
LIEBER IS REGAINING HIS MEMORY.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.059
AND THE SECOND HE REMEMBERS
WHAT HE DID, HE COULD RUN.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.081
COME ON, LET'S GO.
GOT IT.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.450
SHE KNOWS SHE'S NOT
GONNA EAT THAT.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.525
[static hisses]

33:25.570 --> 33:27.595
WHAT?
I DON'T THINK
LIEBER'S THE KILLER.

33:27.630 --> 33:30.190
I SAW SOMETHING ON THE TAPE.
HOLD ON.

33:33.570 --> 33:34.537
THERE.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.433
RIGHT THERE.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.077
HE STOPS AND LOOKS BACK
OVER HIS SHOULDER.

33:39.110 --> 33:40.077
WHY?

33:40.110 --> 33:41.475
BECAUSE SOMEONE
IS CHASING HIM.

33:48.390 --> 33:52.121
TWO CREEPY SOMEONES
TO BE EXACT.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.388
LIEBER DIDN'T KILL THE LAWYER,
BUT HE SAW WHO DID.

33:53.430 --> 33:54.624
RYAN'S ASSASSINS.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.127
THEY CHASED HIM INTO TRAFFIC,
AND THEY THOUGHT

33:56.160 --> 33:57.127
THAT WAS THE END OF IT.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.368
BUT THEN THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS
THAT HE SURVIVED,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.334
GOES INTO A COMA,
WAKES UP WITH AMNESIA.

34:02.370 --> 34:04.167
THE KILLERS THINK
THEY STILL HAVE A WINDOW.

34:04.210 --> 34:08.328
BUT TODAY'S PAPER SAID
HE'S REGAINING HIS MEMORY.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.268
SO RYAN OVERHEARD
THE REAL KILLERS

34:10.310 --> 34:11.743
PLOTTING TO TAKE OUT LIEBER.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.270
WE HAVE GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL

34:13.310 --> 34:14.538
AND TELL LASSIE AND JULES

34:14.580 --> 34:16.844
THAT THESE GUYS ARE COMIN' BACK
TO CLEAN UP THEIR OWN MESS.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.211
COME ON!

34:25.560 --> 34:27.755
YEAH, DOBSON, I NEED
AN A.P.B. OUT

34:27.790 --> 34:29.291
ON A THOMAS LIEBER.

34:29.330 --> 34:30.399
HE'S WANTED FOR QUESTIONING
IN A MURDER.

34:30.430 --> 34:32.227
GET HIS PICTURE
FROM THE DMV.
WHERE'S LIEBER?

34:32.270 --> 34:33.589
GONE. LOOKS LIKE
HE'S ON THE LAM.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.234
HE'S ON A LAMB,
HE WON'T GET FAR.

34:35.270 --> 34:37.568
ALPACA, DIFFERENT STORY.
THOSE THINGS REALLY FLY.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.703
YOU TWO DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE.

34:38.740 --> 34:39.707
IT'S NOT TRUE, LASSIE.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.173
LIEBER DIDN'T KILL
THE LAWYER.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.201
HE WITNESSED RYAN'S ASSASSINS
DO THE DEED,

34:43.240 --> 34:45.140
AND NOW THEY'VE
CLEARLY COME BACK TO GET HIM.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.306
AND I PROMISE I WILL ASK

34:46.350 --> 34:47.578
ALL ABOUT YOUR INSANE
LITTLE THEORIES

34:47.610 --> 34:49.248
ONCE I PUT THEM BOTH
IN JAIL.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.542
[scoffs]

34:50.580 --> 34:52.343
COME ON, GUS.
LET'S FIND TOM.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.284
I SHOULD'VE BEEN ON TO THIS
WAY EARLIER.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.218
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.750
WE DON'T KNOW
THAT LIEBER'S DEAD, SHAWN.

34:59.790 --> 35:00.825
MAYBE HE REMEMBERED
AND LEI-T

35:00.860 --> 35:02.327
BEFORE THE KILLERS
COULD FIND HIM.

35:03.830 --> 35:05.263
HEY, GUYS.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.665
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US.
THEY'RE GONNA KILL US.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.668
DRIVE. DRIVE.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.203
OKAY, ENOUGH WITH THE SEATBELTS.
JUST--LET'S GO!

35:11.240 --> 35:13.401
JUST DRIVE!
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US!

35:13.440 --> 35:21.245
[car horn honks]

35:21.280 --> 35:22.611
[tires screeching]

35:26.450 --> 35:27.849
WHERE'D YOU
LEARN TO DRIVE!?

35:27.890 --> 35:29.812
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
WANNA KEEP THIS UPRIGHT.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.179
(Ryan)
I'M SORRY.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.527
I HAD TO TAKE MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.198
I SNUCK LIEBER
OUT THE AMBULANCE BAY.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.299
AND WHEN I SAW YOU GUYS
PULL UP,

35:35.330 --> 35:36.649
I KNEW WE COULD HIDE
IN THE CAR.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.258
INCOMING!

35:38.300 --> 35:40.666
[tires screech]

35:40.700 --> 35:42.236

[car horn honks]

35:51.980 --> 35:53.845
[tires screech]

35:53.880 --> 35:55.939
SO WAIT. YOU JUST TOOK HIM
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL?

35:55.980 --> 35:57.470
WELL, I HAD TO ACT QUICKLY.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.249
TOM STARTED TO REMEMBER
EVERYTHING.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.611
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING REALLY.
YET.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.911
(Ryan)
AND THE KILLERS.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.188
THE KILLERS WERE ALREADY
IN THE BUILDING.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.481
IT WAS LIKE A GAME
OF CAT AND MOUSE

36:05.530 --> 36:07.885
TRYING TO GET OUT OF THERE
UNSEEN.

36:07.930 --> 36:09.750
[Gus and Spencer scream]

36:09.800 --> 36:11.791
[car horn honks]

36:11.830 --> 36:13.297
DIDN'T WE JUST USE
THE ELEVATOR?

36:13.330 --> 36:15.537
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LET ME TELL THE STORY?

36:15.570 --> 36:16.867
PARKING. HE'S PARKING.
HE'S PARKING!

36:16.900 --> 36:18.333
[tires screech]

36:20.770 --> 36:21.930
[tires screech]

36:21.980 --> 36:24.403
[car horn honking]

36:24.450 --> 36:26.702
VERY NICE, PARTNER.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.445
YOU JUST WEAVED YOUR WAY
THROUGH THOSE OBSTACLES

36:28.480 --> 36:32.348
LIKE A FERRET
ON ROLLER SKATES.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.846
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.319
WHY ARE WE SLOWING DOWN?

36:38.360 --> 36:39.384
NO, NO, NO.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.488
GUS.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.862
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:44.900 --> 36:46.367
DUDE, THE KILLERS
ARE RIGHT BEHIND US.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.937
NOBODY'S FOLLOWING US, SHAWN,
AND THERE NEVER WAS.

36:48.970 --> 36:50.289
THE ONLY THING I KNOW
FOR SURE RIGHT NOW

36:50.340 --> 36:51.967
IS THAT WE ARE HARBORING
TWO FUGITIVES.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.261
OKAY, GUS, LOOK,
I BELIEVE RYAN,

36:53.310 --> 36:55.005
BUT I-I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DON'T.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.304
I'VE MAXED YOU OUT
IN THE BLIND FAITH DEPARTMENT.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.240
AND THAT'S FAIR. SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BELIEVE HIM.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.838
JUST KEEP BELIEVING IN ME.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.973
COME ON, BUDDY.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.988

37:13.660 --> 37:15.321
THAT'S THE GUYS

37:15.360 --> 37:15.951
IT'S COMIN' BACK TO ME.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.889
THEY SHOT THAT MAN.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.761
GO! HIDE IN HERE!

37:58.770 --> 38:00.806
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT!

38:00.840 --> 38:02.478
NOT AT A COMPLETE STOP,
WE WON'T.

38:02.510 --> 38:03.636
(Lieber)
DOCTOR, THIS BAG IS EMPTY.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.806
IS THAT IMPORTANT?
I'LL HOLD HIM OFF.

38:04.850 --> 38:05.703
GET HIM BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.308
HOPEFULLY LASSIE AND JULES
ARE STILL THERE.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.840
HOLD 'EM OFF? HOW?
I DON'T KNOW.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.472
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
I ALWAYS DO.
SO DO I.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.942
SHAWN.
JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

38:11.990 --> 38:13.048
HE'S THE ONE THAT HAS
TO MAKE IT.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.387
I'M GONNA KILL YOU, SHAWN.

38:14.420 --> 38:15.387
I'LL GIVE YOU
EVERY OPPORTUNITY

38:15.420 --> 38:16.387
TO DO THAT, BUDDY.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.956
[gunshots]

38:17.990 --> 38:19.480
GOD.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.969
WE ACCEPT THE TERMS
OF YOUR SURRENDER.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.558
UH, YOU MEAN
YOU'RE SURRENDERING.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.601
YEAH. WE'RE THE ONES
HOLDIN' THE GUNS HERE.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.575
[laughs]
WELL,
YOU AND THE 20 OR SO COPS

38:36.610 --> 38:38.032
THAT ARE WAITING IN LIE
AROUND THAT CORNER.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.071
PLUS, HASN'T THERE BEEN
ENOUGH BLOODSHED ALREADY?

38:40.110 --> 38:41.577
I MEAN,
FIRST THE LAWYER,

38:41.620 --> 38:43.349
THEN RYAN'S POOR SUPER.

38:43.380 --> 38:45.416
YOU GUYS ARE TERRIBLE
AT CLEANING UP Al-TER YOURSELVES.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.589
YEAH? AND YOU'RE LYING
ABOUT THE BACKUP.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.054
LOOK INTO MY EYES...

38:50.090 --> 38:52.786
AND TELL ME IF I'M LYING.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.437
[exhales]

39:06.470 --> 39:08.062
THERE'S NO BACKUP.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.077
YAH!

39:09.110 --> 39:11.408
[gunshots]

39:11.450 --> 39:15.443
[police siren blares]

39:17.420 --> 39:18.785
THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH?

39:18.820 --> 39:20.583
APPARENTLY SO.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.383
THAT'S A GOOD LOOKIN'
HANDLEBAR.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.987
WONDER WHO
HIS MUSTACHE GUY IS.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.480
DOWN ON THE GROUND, COWBOY.

39:28.830 --> 39:35.759
THAT'S BETTER.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.064
AH, GOOD.
YOU'RE BOTH HERE.

39:38.100 --> 39:39.135
WHOA.
LET ME GUESS.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.933
THERE'S A BOMB ON A BUS.

39:40.970 --> 39:42.403
AND--AND--AND IF IT GOES

39:42.440 --> 39:43.475
BELOW 50 MILES PER HOUR,

39:43.510 --> 39:44.647
THE WHOLE THING'S
GONNA EXPLODE.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.500
NO, NO. NO MORE LIES.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.415
I AM QUITTIN' COLD TURKEY.

39:48.450 --> 39:49.747
TURNIN' OVER A NEW LEAF.

39:49.780 --> 39:51.816
REALLY...

39:51.850 --> 39:53.044
NO MORE LYIN' RYAN.
NO.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.079
JUST LIKE YOU SAID,

39:54.120 --> 39:55.553
I AM GONNA BE JUST RYAN.

39:55.590 --> 39:57.057
IF YOU HADN'T BELIEVED ME,

39:57.090 --> 39:59.081
AN INNOCENT PERSON
WOULD HAVE ENDED UP DEAD.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.552
AND ALL BECAUSE
I BECAME A GUY

40:00.590 --> 40:01.921
WHO COULDN'T BE TAKEN
AT HIS WORD.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.655
SO I JUST WANTED TO COME HERE
TO THANK YOU

40:03.700 --> 40:04.962
BEFORE I TOOK OFF.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.560
WELL, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

40:07.600 --> 40:09.090
I BELIEVED YOU
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.961
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU RECOGNIZED
I HAVE GREAT HAIR.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.136
I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIM.

40:13.170 --> 40:14.432
YOU WERE LYING.

40:14.480 --> 40:15.902
IT'S OKAY. I FORGIVE YOU.

40:15.940 --> 40:17.168
I'M COMIN' AROUND.

40:17.210 --> 40:19.770
SO WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

40:19.810 --> 40:21.072
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

40:21.110 --> 40:23.078
I GOT TAPPED TO CAPTAIN
A HOT AIR BALLOON

40:23.120 --> 40:24.178
IN A MULTISTATE REGATTA.

40:24.220 --> 40:25.778
I TAKE OFF TOMORROW.

40:25.820 --> 40:26.912
HOT AIR BALLOONS
HAVE CAPTAINS?

40:26.950 --> 40:28.144
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE
THEY HAVE CAPTAINS.

40:28.190 --> 40:29.179
CAPTAINS, FIRST MATES,

40:29.220 --> 40:30.915
DECKHAN DS.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.927
I GOT REALLY LUCKY.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.120
IT WAS A FRIEND OF A FRIEND
OF MINE KINDA THING.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.491
IF YOU GUYS EVER WANT
TO RIDE,

40:34.530 --> 40:35.554
I MEAN, COME ON,

40:35.600 --> 40:36.624
I OWE YOU.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.025
I'LL EVEN LET YOU STEER
THE THING.

40:38.060 --> 40:41.097
JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE, OKAY?

40:41.130 --> 40:43.690
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.766
MAN, I AM GLAD HE IS
OUT OF OUR LIFE.

40:46.810 --> 40:49.904
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
HOT AIR BALLOON?

40:49.940 --> 40:51.202
IT'S CRAZY THOUGH, RIGHT?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.573
YEAH, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.145
THINK HE WOULD
