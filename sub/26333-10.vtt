00:02.580 --> 00:03.500
Previously on
"A Million Little Things"...

00:03.500 --> 00:04.540
You had sex with Ashley?

00:04.540 --> 00:05.790
Are you at all worried
about this?

00:05.790 --> 00:07.040
He's talking about Maggie.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.460
She ended things with me.

00:08.460 --> 00:10.420
She's not just your ex.
Maggie's our friend.

00:10.420 --> 00:12.290
The guys needed to know
if you were up for touring.

00:12.290 --> 00:13.380
You're standing a couple feet
from the bottle

00:13.380 --> 00:14.670
and you're not drinking it.

00:14.670 --> 00:15.790
This could be huge.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.540
Rome: I don't know
how you do it all, babe.

00:17.540 --> 00:19.420
Launching a new restaurant,
taking care of the house...

00:19.420 --> 00:20.710
And reminding you
to take your meds.

00:20.710 --> 00:21.830
Which I already did.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.040
No, you didn't.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.120
No, I didn't.
Damn it.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.170
I just want
what's best for you.

00:26.170 --> 00:27.500
Pretending
you're not the father,

00:27.500 --> 00:28.960
I know
it's unbearable.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.960
It's got to be the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.170
After all the business

00:33.170 --> 00:33.920
that Jon has thrown
your way,

00:33.920 --> 00:35.670
you're just gonna, what,

00:35.670 --> 00:37.710
sit there
and screw his family over?

00:37.710 --> 00:38.830
Gary: You, Jon --

00:38.830 --> 00:40.000
you went through the whole thing
with me,

00:40.000 --> 00:41.580
and you convinced me to live,

00:41.580 --> 00:42.750
and then you left me.

00:42.750 --> 00:43.500
Eddie: Gary, no!

01:08.210 --> 01:09.120
Morning?

01:10.920 --> 01:13.250
Another dream? Oh, man.

01:13.250 --> 01:16.540
Regina, I cannot be held
responsible for the things
that I do in your dreams.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.170
You were kissing her.
Who?

01:18.170 --> 01:19.500
Anika,
and you were liking it.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.540
I was?

01:20.540 --> 01:21.960
And she was liking it.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.580
Of course she was.
But who's Anika?

01:23.580 --> 01:25.210
The pastry chef
from my old catering company.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.620
And in my dream,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.880
you two were doing some
nasty things with frosting.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.670
Oh, well,
I do like frosting.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.120
Oh, yeah, frosting.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.830
That's my favorite.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.580
Well, how about this?

01:41.790 --> 01:44.210
Oh, Anika does that move.

01:44.210 --> 01:46.920
Yeah? What about this?

01:46.920 --> 01:47.750
No.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.250
Okay.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.540
I know what
you're trying to do.
Mm-hmm.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.330
It's already 9:20,

01:52.330 --> 01:55.080
and I've got to help Delilah
get a Christmas tree.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.040
And I promised Katherine
that I would teach her

01:57.040 --> 01:58.420
how to make
a gingerbread house --

01:58.420 --> 02:01.380
both things that can wait
7 to 10 minutes.

02:02.170 --> 02:03.580
Five?

02:03.580 --> 02:05.710
Since when do I
have to attack you?

02:08.580 --> 02:09.380
Fine.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.380
Fine.

02:13.790 --> 02:16.670
But tonight, I will be
having my way with you sexually.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.750
Looking forward to it, Anika.

we said 10:00?

Eddie: Oh.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.790
I'm sorry, Clark Kent.

03:20.790 --> 03:24.000
No, I was looking for
Superman.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.960
Will you let him know
that I will be back at 10:00?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
But we're done,
right, Mom?

03:28.960 --> 03:31.540
Can I go get ready to go
Christmas tree shopping?

03:31.540 --> 03:32.670
Sure.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.540
Yes! Come on, Dad.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.960
You're the best, Mom!

03:38.540 --> 03:39.880
Second best.

03:41.210 --> 03:44.580
Hello-o-o, Dixon family!

03:44.580 --> 03:45.830
Who is that?

03:45.830 --> 03:47.250
I come bearing gifts.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.380
Come forth
and be delighted.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.000
Oh, wow. Who are you,

03:52.000 --> 03:54.040
and what have you done
with my friend Gary?

03:54.040 --> 03:56.710
Yeah. I've literally never
seen you this positive.

03:56.710 --> 03:58.380
Well, fam, I appreciate
the feedback.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.000
But I think you'll find
that, this year,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.170
I'm all positive,
all the time.

04:02.170 --> 04:06.080
Which is why
I got you this.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.080
Is it a video game?
No, Soph,
it's cooler than that.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.380
That's a thing
that lets you know

04:09.380 --> 04:11.040
when you're done pulling the car
into the garage.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.500
You know, just in case
you find yourself

04:12.500 --> 04:13.500
parking while blindfolded.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.500
But I do not know
how to drive.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.210
With this,
it doesn't matter.

04:17.210 --> 04:19.290
I got you that.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.420
And I love it.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.330
Admittedly,
some of these are regifts.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.210
Danny, don't worry.
I didn't forget about you.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.750
This is for you.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.580
It's a fishing pole.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.670
Yeah.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.670
Take it.
Just take it, Danny.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.000
All right, all right,
all right.

04:34.000 --> 04:34.880
Third time's the charm.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.880
Hut! Hut, hut!

04:36.880 --> 04:38.080
Oh.
It's a football.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.120
And a speaker.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.120
Go long.
Here comes Coldplay.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.460
Well, I -- I need
a picture of this.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.710
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.960
Anyone seen my phone?

04:48.960 --> 04:50.670
Mom, what is up with you?

04:50.670 --> 04:52.920
You've been forgetting
everything lately,

04:52.920 --> 04:55.330
like your phone and your keys.
-No, I'm not.

04:55.330 --> 04:56.210
Can you go check
and see if I left it

04:56.210 --> 04:58.290
with Ashley in the study?
-Yeah.

04:58.290 --> 05:01.170
Oh. Finally, a use
for that app that you got

05:01.170 --> 05:02.620
so that you
could spy on me.

05:02.620 --> 05:03.710
It's not spying when
I'm her mother, right?

05:03.710 --> 05:05.380
Yeah. Yeah.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.880
Okay. It's upstairs.
I'll be right back.

05:08.080 --> 05:12.880
Well, thank you for coming
and spreading good cheer.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.330
How are they doing, huh?
These kids of yours?

05:14.330 --> 05:15.540
Delilah: Amazing.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.380
Danny just got
a used fishing pole.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.000
Lucky fella.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.080
What about you, huh?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.710
How are you
and your pregnancy brain,

05:23.710 --> 05:26.210
or did you forget
that you're pregnant?

05:26.210 --> 05:30.330
D, when are you gonna
tell them, hmm?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.500
You said you were waiting
for the second trimester.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.380
And based on
our "hello" hug,

05:34.380 --> 05:37.420
I would say
that you are there.

05:38.620 --> 05:39.830
I don't know.

05:39.830 --> 05:40.580
I guess I'm just...

05:40.580 --> 05:41.830
I'm worried.

05:41.830 --> 05:43.170
It's Christmas.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.080
It's gonna be
very emotional.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.460
Every time
they look at my belly,

05:47.460 --> 05:48.790
they're gonna think of Jon.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.330
How could they not?

05:50.330 --> 05:54.330
But that's why Merry Gary
is in the house.

05:54.330 --> 05:55.790
I'm gonna find some tape.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.920
I'm gonna help you put the rest
of these decorations up.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.080
You do that.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.120
And then we're gonna
get ourselves

06:00.120 --> 06:02.670
a Nativity scene,
sans Jesus.

06:02.670 --> 06:06.040
And that's how we're gonna sneak
your baby into this family.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.250
Ah, that's brilliant.

06:09.460 --> 06:11.580
Do not B.S. me about FTC rules

06:11.580 --> 06:14.250
when I know you break those
all the time, Donny.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.170
You knew Jon
longer than I did.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.460
Don't do this to this family.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.290
It's almost Christmas.

06:19.290 --> 06:20.880
Come on, Donny.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.750
I got to go.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.040
Oh, hi.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.000
Hey.
Hey.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.380
I don't know who Donny is,

06:26.380 --> 06:29.210
but I sure hope what we did
didn't complicate things.

06:29.210 --> 06:30.540
Don't flatter yourself.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.880
No, I, um...

06:34.880 --> 06:36.920
I just was trying to get
Danny one of those

06:36.920 --> 06:38.790
build-your-own drone sets
for Christmas,

06:38.790 --> 06:40.380
and they're sold out.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.580
Well, I like where
your head's at.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.000
It's all about
helping this family

06:43.000 --> 06:45.040
have an amazing Christmas,
am I right?

06:53.710 --> 06:56.210
Sorry about earlier,

06:56.210 --> 06:59.120
but you are going to have
plenty of Mom Time

06:59.120 --> 07:02.120
once I'm on the road
with the band.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.250
Speaking of which...

07:03.250 --> 07:04.670
Whoa.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.380
I may be compensating

07:09.380 --> 07:10.790
for having to work
during Christmas.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.920
I invented that move.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.210
Thanks to my work guilt,

07:14.210 --> 07:17.000
our son owns approximately
six million pieces of LEGO.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.710
I think I stepped on
half of them.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.120
Oh, by the way...

07:22.120 --> 07:25.120
I think he's on to us.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.670
Did he ask you
about Santa, too?

07:27.670 --> 07:29.670
I was hoping he'd hold on to
his innocence another year.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.250
Yeah, me, too.

07:34.290 --> 07:35.290
Theo:
Hey, Dad, you ready?

07:35.290 --> 07:36.210
Yeah, I'll be right out.

07:36.210 --> 07:37.580
Hold on.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.170
I'll have him back
by 4:00.

07:39.170 --> 07:41.290
He says he wants a piggyback
ride all day.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.460
Maybe 3:30.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.170
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.500
Ignore the signs.
Everyone does.

07:57.500 --> 07:59.120
It's okay.
No, I'm serious.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.000
I make the rules around here,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.830
and there's no way
that any call you get

08:02.830 --> 08:03.960
is gonna be louder than

08:03.960 --> 08:06.670
Rachel and that gum.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.540
It's like she's chewing
a never-ending steak.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.040
Thank you, but...

08:12.040 --> 08:14.620
I'm not telling anybody
that I'm doing this

08:14.620 --> 08:16.830
until after I get
my first scan back.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.290
Just don't want to get
anybody's hopes up.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.960
But this is
all about hope.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.620
Half of beating this is

08:25.620 --> 08:27.250
believing that
you're gonna beat it.

08:27.250 --> 08:30.170
And half is having
a support system.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.250
Is any part of it chemo?

08:42.710 --> 08:44.210
Okay, people.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.540
We're gonna get
the biggest tree here.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.250
How about we'd get the
biggest tree that my
lower back can carry.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.710
How about that?
Yes.

08:49.710 --> 08:51.540
You know what?

08:51.540 --> 08:53.380
You got high ceilings
and Mom's credit card.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.790
Go for it. Let's do this.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.880
-Yes! I love that idea.
-Yes. Yeah, let's do this!

08:56.880 --> 08:58.460
Whoa, that was quite
the mood swing.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.000
I thought that I was the one
on anti-depressants.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.460
Wait, we can do bits
about your drugs?

09:04.120 --> 09:06.250
I'll circle back
in 10 minutes.
Rome: Yeah.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.920
Delilah:
Hey, stay together, okay?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.580
And no touching
the chainsaw.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.790
On it.
Good call.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.250
D? D?
Mm.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.750
Get a tin
of tri-colored popcorn,

09:15.750 --> 09:17.620
because the show
has started.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.920
Look at this sad sack

09:18.920 --> 09:20.290
trying to load
his sad tree...
Stop it.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.040
...onto his sad car.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.460
Should we help him?
No.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.580
No, Felix had his chance.

09:25.580 --> 09:26.960
If he hadn't
gambled it all away,

09:26.960 --> 09:29.830
Rhonda wouldn't have
moved back to Boca.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.210
Who am I kidding?
That's me in five years.

09:32.210 --> 09:34.420
Doesn't have to be.
Call her.

09:34.420 --> 09:35.460
No, I can't do it.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.210
Rhonda's still
licking her wounds.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.880
I will not do
long-distance, D.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.920
It's not fair
to either of us.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.710
I'm talking about Maggie.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.250
I know who
you're talking about,

09:43.250 --> 09:45.620
and I can tell you exactly how
that conversation ends --

09:45.620 --> 09:48.250
with us arguing about
whether or not she's
gonna fight her cancer,

09:48.250 --> 09:49.170
and I can't do it anymore.

09:49.170 --> 09:50.170
And you know what?

09:50.170 --> 09:51.620
Rhonda agrees with me.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.710
Mom! Look!

09:53.710 --> 09:55.830
It's fantastic!

09:55.830 --> 09:57.120
That is not fantastic.
Oh, no.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.500
I'm gonna go
talk him out of that.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.920
-Thank you.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.120
Sophie: Are you gonna be
able to pick that up?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.920
Rome: I don't know.
That's the problem.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.210
Gary:
We're not gonna be one of those
families that get a white tree.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.290
Hey.
Hey.

10:05.290 --> 10:07.000
Rome: I agree with him.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.500
So how are you feeling?
I'm good. Good.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.830
A little tired, but good.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.170
How about you?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.750
You -- You excited
to get back on the road?

10:15.750 --> 10:18.000
I am.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.880
I never thought
I'd have a chance

10:18.880 --> 10:21.080
to play an arena again.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.500
I did.

10:24.460 --> 10:27.250
Ed. Ed. Can we get
your help, please?

10:27.250 --> 10:28.750
Yeah, come grab
the middle part.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.170
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

10:30.170 --> 10:31.500
-Take the middle, please.
-What do we need?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.620
Oh! Oh!

10:34.620 --> 10:35.830
-D!
-Oh!

10:35.830 --> 10:38.460
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.620
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.830
Fine. Yeah, oh, yeah.

10:41.830 --> 10:44.330
For someone who just
fell on her tush

10:44.330 --> 10:46.960
in front of all these strangers,
I'm fine.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.750
Are you sure you're okay?

10:48.750 --> 10:50.170
No, I'm good.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.290
Let's get you
back to the car.

10:51.290 --> 10:52.210
Why?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.960
She said she's fine.
You're fine, right?

10:55.960 --> 10:58.620
Yeah. Totally.
Let's go see the tree.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.580
See? Why are you guys making
such a big deal about it?

11:00.580 --> 11:01.880
Uh, it's nothing.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.540
I just, you know --
just, you know,

11:03.540 --> 11:06.000
I broke my ankle
slipping on ice one time.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.170
Me, too.
So did I.

11:07.170 --> 11:08.040
Yeah.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.330
Long story short,

11:09.330 --> 11:11.120
trying to get autographs
at the Ice Capades,

11:11.120 --> 11:12.080
let the performers
come to you.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.080
Right?

11:14.750 --> 11:15.920
Okay. Let's...I'm --

11:21.750 --> 11:22.830
Rome: Should we just throw these
lights away and buy new ones?

11:22.830 --> 11:24.290
-Please.
-Here I come!

11:24.290 --> 11:26.080
Here I come.
Nobody -- Nobody help me.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.710
I don't want anybody's --
I don't want anybody's help.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.080
Okay.

11:29.080 --> 11:29.920
-Get in there.
-All right.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.250
-Yay.
-Wow.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.670
-Look at that.
-Oh, that was smooth.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.460
-Looks pretty great.
-Amazing.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.920
Last year, you said
it was a hazard

11:35.920 --> 11:38.330
that burned down an average
of 200 homes per year.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.120
Yeah, well, this year,
I'm just thinking that.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.170
All right, you guys.
Let's trim this tree.

11:42.170 --> 11:43.920
Rome: Let's do it.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.790
Danny: Yeah. Yeah.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.920
-That's no small feat.
-No.

11:53.290 --> 11:56.040
Jon: Ho, ho, holy cow,
it's Christmas.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.460
Hello, there.
Daddy!

11:57.460 --> 11:59.250
Daddy?

11:59.250 --> 12:02.540
Daddy? I haven't had kids
since 1863.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.580
What do you mean "Daddy"?

12:06.880 --> 12:11.120
♪ Christ,
the everlasting Lord ♪

12:11.120 --> 12:13.210

12:16.500 --> 12:20.330
♪ Offspring of

12:20.330 --> 12:22.580
If I go in there, she's
just gonna say she doesn't
want to talk about it.

12:22.580 --> 12:23.920
Maybe I go?

12:24.920 --> 12:28.170

12:28.170 --> 12:30.750

But I really don't

I just want to make
a turkey sandwich.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.710
Want one?

12:44.710 --> 12:46.250
No, thanks.

12:46.250 --> 12:50.790
But since we are not
talking about you,

12:50.790 --> 12:52.380
mind if I talk about me?

12:52.380 --> 12:54.500
Eddie.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.920
What? I just...

12:57.580 --> 12:59.250
...feel upset

12:59.250 --> 13:02.960
that I'm gonna be away
for Christmas.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.210
And now, seeing
all these decorations,

13:05.210 --> 13:08.750
that's just
making me more sad.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.170
I know what you're doing.

13:10.170 --> 13:11.920
Hmm? Oh,
adding spicy mustard?

13:11.920 --> 13:14.170
Do not tell anyone.

13:14.170 --> 13:15.790
This is my
secret ingredient.

13:15.790 --> 13:18.750
Okay, Spicy Mustard.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.290
You're trying to tell me

13:20.290 --> 13:21.920
that it's okay
to feel the way I do,

13:21.920 --> 13:23.920
and that it's normal,

13:23.920 --> 13:27.710
but I do not want
to talk about it.

13:27.710 --> 13:31.000
Great, 'cause we're here
to talk about me.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.330
And what I'm feeling
is that

13:34.330 --> 13:38.380
there have been
so many changes.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.540
And now, my not being able
to be with Theo

13:40.540 --> 13:41.620
for the holiday...

13:41.620 --> 13:43.040
Which is really similar

13:43.040 --> 13:46.170
to me not being able to be
with Dad for the holiday.

13:46.170 --> 13:49.420
Oh, that's interesting.

13:49.420 --> 13:53.670
So, what do you think I --
we -- should do?

13:54.710 --> 13:56.710
Not talk about it?

13:56.710 --> 13:59.540
Not talk about it.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.920
Then what? Are we just gonna
eat our sandwiches?

14:01.920 --> 14:08.210
I mean, maybe we could
bury ourselves in music.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.670
Interesting tactic.

14:11.670 --> 14:12.920
My guitar's in my car.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.250
And mine is in my room.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.580
I'll meet you
in five minutes.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.710
Deal.

14:22.460 --> 14:23.920
Thanks.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.000
-Hey, Regina's here!
-Hey.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.620
-What's up, mama?
-Nice.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.000
Thank you.
You're the best.

14:33.000 --> 14:33.920
Gary: That's what's up.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.500
It may not be frosting,

14:37.500 --> 14:40.120
but I put a little extra
marshmallow in there for you.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.250
Good.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.750
Ooh, guys, I have
to call time out here.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.920
Daniel Dixon...

14:46.920 --> 14:48.830
is this or is this not

14:48.830 --> 14:49.960
a picture of you
on the potty?

14:49.960 --> 14:52.420
-Aww.
-Hey!

14:52.420 --> 14:53.330
Danny: Oh, ho...

14:53.330 --> 14:54.670
-It is.
-Danny...

14:54.670 --> 14:55.830
I believe it is.
No, no!

14:55.830 --> 14:57.620
I think it is!

14:57.620 --> 14:59.620
Hey, guys, that was the only way
we got him to sit still.

14:59.620 --> 15:00.710
That's --
Oh!

15:00.710 --> 15:01.880
That's Sophie.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.000
Yeah,
'cause Dad would make us

15:03.000 --> 15:04.710
take a picture
for an ornament every year,

15:04.710 --> 15:06.670
and that one is my favorite.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.960
Danny: Yeah, well,
let's see if it still is

15:08.960 --> 15:11.170
when we pull out
yours, okay?

15:11.170 --> 15:13.330
I do not have a bad one
like that.

15:15.210 --> 15:16.500
Jon: What do you think?

15:16.500 --> 15:18.540
Yeah?

15:20.750 --> 15:21.710
Gary: Excuse me.

15:21.710 --> 15:22.880
-Ooh!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.290
-Oh, you wish.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.750
Ashley: Hey.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.620
You okay?

15:31.620 --> 15:33.540
No, I'm not okay.

15:33.540 --> 15:34.830
I'm not okay.

15:34.830 --> 15:35.920
I don't want to --
I don't want to give gifts.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.000
I don't want to drink eggnog.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.120
I want to know...why.

15:42.170 --> 15:44.170
Come on, Jerry!

15:44.170 --> 15:46.580
You said you had the votes.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.620
Damn it.

15:49.380 --> 15:54.000
If you knew everything,
w-why he did it...

15:54.000 --> 15:55.830
would that change
anything for you?

15:55.830 --> 15:58.500
Yeah, it would, I think.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.670
I don't know.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.880
I know it's hard to fake it,

16:07.880 --> 16:09.580
but, like you said,

16:09.580 --> 16:11.170
the only thing
that matters right now

16:11.170 --> 16:13.540
is making sure this family
has a great Christmas.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.500
Suck it up. You're right.
You're right.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.960
There's
a 12-year-old boy out there

16:16.960 --> 16:18.210
who's stronger than me.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.210
And he's just waiting for you
to go make a joke

16:20.210 --> 16:22.040
about him
sitting on the potty.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.290
I got to get out there,

16:23.290 --> 16:25.420
and I got to poke fun
at an innocent child.

16:25.420 --> 16:27.920
If anyone can do it,
it's you.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.170
Well, it's the holidays.

16:29.170 --> 16:30.670
It's the least I can do.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.670
Ashley: Donny, don't make
any moves until I get there.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.420
I'm gonna say something
really controversial here.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.290
Why hadn't anyone
called Santa

16:48.290 --> 16:49.460
on this one work-day
a year thing?

16:49.460 --> 16:51.000
Dude works one day a year?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.330
And in fairness,
I just quit my job.

16:54.330 --> 16:56.710
I'm one working day away
from being black Santa Claus.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.580
Okay. They think
we're getting decorations.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.670
We got, like,
four minutes?

17:00.670 --> 17:02.000
What?
Let's play Beat the Clock.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Yeah, right here,
right now, Black Santa.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.830
Drop your pants.

17:04.830 --> 17:06.420
Regina --

17:06.420 --> 17:08.120
Do I have to remind you...

17:08.120 --> 17:10.670
that we are here
to spread Christmas cheer.

17:10.670 --> 17:13.380
Which is exactly what
I am doing, Mr. Howard.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.620
It's the pills.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.960
Okay.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.580
Delilah: Hi!

17:38.580 --> 17:40.880
You made it.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.120
I got your voicemail.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.290
Thank you for the invite.

17:44.290 --> 17:45.880
Why decorate my tree alone

17:45.880 --> 17:48.120
when I could have my friends
do it for me, right?

17:48.120 --> 17:49.330
You're a very smart woman.

17:49.330 --> 17:50.580
You guys,
we're gonna need more lights.

17:50.580 --> 17:51.500
We need...

17:51.500 --> 17:53.420
Ah.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.880
Oh, Maggie, you know what?
We ran out of lights.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.710
Could you maybe
run back out and, um,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.960
pick up a box at the --
at the Christmas tree lot?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.620
Uh, two things --

18:01.620 --> 18:02.880
I don't have a car,

18:02.880 --> 18:04.880
and I don't know
where that is.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.750
Oh, which is where you
and your new car

18:07.750 --> 18:08.540
could come into play.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.750
Uh...

18:09.750 --> 18:10.750
He's got a new car.

18:10.750 --> 18:11.880
Oh.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.120
Danny: Hey, Gare,
kiss her.

18:14.380 --> 18:15.580
Well, you're under
the mistletoe.

18:15.580 --> 18:17.210
You got to kiss.

18:17.210 --> 18:20.120
I don't make the rules.
I just enforce them.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.290
What you call "mistletoe"
is, in fact, a parasite

18:23.290 --> 18:26.710
whose seeds are spread
through bird feces.

18:26.710 --> 18:28.880
So you'll understand if
I'm not inclined to pucker up.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.040
Uh, and I decline the kiss
for a host of other reasons.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.170
And you think it's
because of the medication?

18:39.420 --> 18:42.290
I think it's because
of everything.

18:42.290 --> 18:43.670
Is -- Is it
something I'm doing?

18:43.670 --> 18:45.710
N-Not in the way
you're thinking.

18:45.710 --> 18:47.670
You're beautiful,

18:47.670 --> 18:50.250
and every part of me wants
to play Beat the Clock with you.

18:50.250 --> 18:54.790
But not every part of me can.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.000
And I don't know --
I don't --

18:56.000 --> 18:57.620
I don't know if
it's because of the pills

18:57.620 --> 18:59.500
or if it's because I'm just
not feeling like myself.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.500
Like...

19:00.500 --> 19:02.040
W-Well, what
do you mean by that?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.000
T-Tell me.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.580
Even that.

19:08.580 --> 19:09.960
I know you're just
taking care of me,

19:09.960 --> 19:12.750
and I love you
for it, but...

19:12.750 --> 19:15.250
at the same time,
you're taking care of me.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.830
I'm supposed to be the man.

19:18.830 --> 19:21.830
And right now...

19:21.830 --> 19:23.500
I don't feel like one.

Hey, guys.
Hey.

20:35.210 --> 20:36.540
Okay, so...
Eddie, can I, um,

20:36.540 --> 20:38.620
ask you to help me reach
something in the kitchen?

20:38.620 --> 20:39.830
Yeah, sure.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.420
Keep going, Soph.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.380
I don't think
we should panic.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.250
I mean, a little spotting
doesn't mean

20:48.250 --> 20:50.380
that there's necessarily
a problem.
But you -- You fell.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.830
So we're gonna get you
to the doctor.

20:52.830 --> 20:53.830
I just -- I don't want
the kids today to --

20:53.830 --> 20:55.670
D, we're going.

20:56.670 --> 20:58.750
Brr!

20:58.750 --> 21:01.170
Uh...what's going on?

21:01.170 --> 21:02.420
Is everything all right?

21:04.540 --> 21:06.580
Eddie: Hey, guys.
Your mom forgot to, uh,

21:06.580 --> 21:08.500
pick up the sparkling
apple juice.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.670
Yeah.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.420
Just another thing
I've been forgetful about.

21:11.420 --> 21:13.330
Rome: But Aunt Regina
and Uncle Rome are here.

21:13.330 --> 21:16.380
and that apple juice, we just --
sparkling apple juice...

21:16.380 --> 21:18.380
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, we need that.

21:18.380 --> 21:19.620
Uh, not helping.

21:19.620 --> 21:22.040
So, uh, Soph,
keep practicing,

21:22.040 --> 21:24.120
Danny, keep decorating,

21:24.120 --> 21:25.540
and your mom and I will be back
before you know it.

21:25.540 --> 21:26.380
-Go.
-Bye.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.670
Delilah: Bye.

21:27.670 --> 21:29.500
Okay?

21:29.500 --> 21:31.290
Got to have
that sparkling apple cider,

21:31.290 --> 21:33.420
'cause -- it's juice.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.830
It's juice?

21:34.830 --> 21:36.620
Stop.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.500
It's juice.

21:42.750 --> 21:43.830
-Okay.
-My mouth's watering.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.380
We got margaritas
for the adults...

21:45.380 --> 21:47.790
Yeah, I'll take that one.
Thank you.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.500
Mm-hmm. And virgin margarita
for the young adults.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.750
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.250
Let's make sure
we got the right glasses.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.620
Yeah, good catch.

21:55.620 --> 21:56.880
Here you go.
Hey, hold up.

21:58.210 --> 21:59.750
We need umbrellas
and bendy straws.

21:59.750 --> 22:00.620
-Ah!
-Yes.

22:00.620 --> 22:01.790
We do.
-Yeah. I'll get 'em.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.210
-We do.
-You know what?

22:03.210 --> 22:04.710
Honestly, I don't think
I could even do a margarita

22:04.710 --> 22:05.750
without an umbrella.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.080
It just makes sense.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.170
Hey, didn't Mom and Eddie

22:08.170 --> 22:09.620
go to get
sparkling apple juice?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.790
Yeah.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.330
Got to have
the sparkling apple juice.

22:13.330 --> 22:15.380
'Tis the reason
for the season.

22:15.380 --> 22:18.170
Yeah, but there's,
like, four bottles here.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.830
No. No, no, n-not...

22:20.830 --> 22:24.960
No, sparkling apple cider,
you know, not the juice.

22:24.960 --> 22:28.620
The juice...is disgusting.
Don't drink the juice.

22:28.620 --> 22:30.170
What's you doing, babe?
I'm -- I'mma go with you.
Regina: Yep.

22:30.170 --> 22:31.710
Let me see it.

22:31.710 --> 22:32.960
That was weird.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.710
Yeah.

22:34.710 --> 22:36.750
Oh, my God.

22:36.750 --> 22:37.750
What is it?

22:37.750 --> 22:38.920
I'm on the tracking app,

22:38.920 --> 22:41.580
and it says that
Mom's at Boston General.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.250
What?

22:43.250 --> 22:44.420
I'm --
I'm sure it's fine,

22:44.420 --> 22:45.670
but I'm gonna go
check it out, okay?

22:45.670 --> 22:47.250
You have to stay here.
I'll go with you.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.790
No, you have to cover
for me.

22:48.790 --> 22:50.330
Okay.
Okay.

22:55.790 --> 22:58.290
You're absolutely sure
that D wants just --

22:58.290 --> 22:59.960
just white lights?

22:59.960 --> 23:02.670
Uh, the lights that match
the rest of the tree?

23:02.670 --> 23:04.880
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's what she wants.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.250
Okay, that man
is older than Christmas,

23:08.250 --> 23:09.830
and he just
pulled out his checkbook.
Yeah.

23:09.830 --> 23:11.080
Let's do this.
Yeah.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.250
Bryce: Beep, beep.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.580
Okay, then.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.790
Okay, great.

23:19.790 --> 23:20.710
Beep, beep.

23:20.710 --> 23:21.750
Good job, Honey.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.420
Gary: "Beep, beep"?

23:23.420 --> 23:24.750
This is unbelievable.
Are you seeing this?

23:24.750 --> 23:28.750
I see what your eyes see,
and I also cannot believe it.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.420
Uh, excuse us.

23:30.420 --> 23:31.380
Sorry, uh...
Hi.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.710
All we have is this

23:32.710 --> 23:33.960
one sad little box
of Christmas lights,

23:33.960 --> 23:35.830
so would you mind
if we jumped over you there?

23:35.830 --> 23:37.460
I would, actually.

23:37.460 --> 23:39.210
Sorry.
Uh, we're in a bit of a rush.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.540
Wow. That's...

23:42.540 --> 23:45.670
Because we probably wouldn't
have picked this line

23:45.670 --> 23:48.000
if we had known
that all of Aisle 3

23:48.000 --> 23:49.210
was gonna cut in front of us.

23:49.210 --> 23:50.460
Hey, you know what?

23:50.460 --> 23:52.670
Maybe they're opening
their own Christmas tree lot.

23:52.670 --> 23:53.960
Like, a satellite office.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.420
Like they're franchising.

23:55.420 --> 23:56.790
For your information,
this is my husband.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.420
Oh.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.290
Well, I'm happy for you
that you found each other.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.210
Aww, what you have
seems so special.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.540
What you are doing
is total crap.

24:04.540 --> 24:05.500
Excuse me? Hmm?

24:05.500 --> 24:08.000
Well, it's just that,
on Earth,

24:08.000 --> 24:10.880
the planet that we're on...
Here.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.790
Yeah, there's, like,
a way to do things.

24:12.790 --> 24:15.790
Yes. On this planet,
we have what we call
a -- a social contract.

24:15.790 --> 24:17.620
Not that it's
any of your business,

24:17.620 --> 24:19.120
but I'm actually feeling
a little under the weather,

24:19.120 --> 24:20.830
so I'd like to get home.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.170
-Aww.
-Aww.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.380
Got a little sniffle?

24:23.380 --> 24:24.460
Oh, my gosh,
that's terrible.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.210
I am so --
It must be going around.

24:26.210 --> 24:27.460
Yeah, you know what's
not going around?

24:27.460 --> 24:28.540
Huh?

24:28.540 --> 24:29.710
Breast cancer.
Ah!

24:29.710 --> 24:31.380
And yet we both have it.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.290
Very rare in men,
but I got it.

24:33.290 --> 24:35.120
But it's more
common in women.
It is.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.120
Right. Still kind of weird,
'cause I got it twice.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.880
And yet you don't see us
cutting in line

24:42.880 --> 24:44.580
with a pallet of Christmas.

24:44.580 --> 24:46.790
No, you don't.

24:46.790 --> 24:48.330
-Go ahead.
-Aww.

24:48.330 --> 24:49.670
-Bryce, what are you doing?
-I'm so sorry.

24:49.670 --> 24:50.750
-Thank you.
-So sorry.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.170
It's very, very sweet.
Feliz Navidad.

24:52.170 --> 24:54.540
Very nice.
What a gentleman.

24:56.210 --> 24:58.790
They're gonna have
problems tonight.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.330
Okay.
Did Halmoni teach you
how to do this, too?

25:02.500 --> 25:05.580
My mom would never let me
play with my food.

25:05.580 --> 25:07.210
This is Auntie Regina.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.710
Are we putting up the gutters
or eating the gutters?

25:11.710 --> 25:13.830

Mm.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.750
What?

26:23.750 --> 26:26.880
It's just, um...

26:26.880 --> 26:29.830
When Theo was born,

26:29.830 --> 26:31.830
with my drinking,

26:31.830 --> 26:33.580
I wasn't there.

as this situation is,

Hello. I'm Dr. Ehrlich.

26:46.710 --> 26:49.500
So, you fell on the ice
and had some spotting.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.500
I did, yes.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.580
How far along are you?

26:51.580 --> 26:53.290
14 weeks.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.500
If you want
to lay back there,

26:55.500 --> 26:56.620
let's see
how your baby's doing.

26:56.620 --> 26:57.420
Okay.

26:57.420 --> 26:58.460
I'm gonna be outside.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.210
No. Stay.

27:01.620 --> 27:04.620
You're the father.
You need to be here.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.620
You were such
a great dad today.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.380
I just want everybody
to be okay.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.380
I think my --

27:20.380 --> 27:22.080
I think my favorite was, uh,

27:22.080 --> 27:24.040
"I don't want to spend
the year I have left

27:24.040 --> 27:25.580
standing in line
behind you."

27:26.380 --> 27:27.880
Mmm. Delicious.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.540
Here.

27:29.540 --> 27:31.210
Mmm, mmm.

27:33.290 --> 27:36.380
Look at us
bonding over cancer.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.540
It's a nice change.

27:43.040 --> 27:47.790
So...friends?

27:47.790 --> 27:50.040
Yeah. I can do friends.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.380
I don't think
you can do friends.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.420
I have tons of friends.
Yeah.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.460
I'm stupid with friends.

27:53.460 --> 27:54.620
No, I'm talking about
female friends.

27:54.620 --> 27:56.170
I have female friends.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.290
No,
I'm talking about women

27:57.290 --> 27:58.790
who are
not just your friends

27:58.790 --> 28:01.500
because they are the spouses
of your guy friends.

28:03.710 --> 28:04.710
Just eat your brittle.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.710
Oh.

28:06.710 --> 28:09.420
And keep it in the tin.
Come on, this is a new car.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.540
Calm down.

28:10.540 --> 28:12.040
The only thing better
than new-car smell

28:12.040 --> 28:13.960
is peanut brittle smell.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.170
Wow. What is --

28:16.170 --> 28:18.670
What have we here?

28:18.670 --> 28:21.540
Is this a --
another one of your friends

28:21.540 --> 28:22.960
who you cannot
be friends with?

28:22.960 --> 28:24.750
Screw it.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.830
If we're gonna be friends,
I can tell anything, right?

28:26.830 --> 28:30.040
Yeah.
Okay, great.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.420
You remember,
uh, my neighbor

28:32.420 --> 28:34.460
who accused me
of stealing her paper?

28:34.460 --> 28:38.080
Mrs. Goldfeine,
the old lady with a walker?

28:38.080 --> 28:40.460
Well, she wore me down.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.670
She wore me down,
and she broke my heart,

28:42.670 --> 28:44.670
and I broke her hip.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.920
We did it
right where you're sitting.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.420
Oh, great.

28:50.420 --> 28:51.670
And it took me
an hour and a half

28:51.670 --> 28:52.670
to get her
out of the car.

28:52.670 --> 28:56.250
Well, thank you,
Mrs. Goldfeine,

28:56.250 --> 28:57.830
'cause this scarf
is mine now.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.580
Okay. Good news.

28:59.580 --> 29:02.290
The amniotic sac
has not been compromised,

29:02.290 --> 29:04.250
so your baby's fine.
-Okay.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.080
Uh, maybe just take it easy
for the next couple of days --

29:06.080 --> 29:07.380
you know, avoid stress.

29:07.380 --> 29:10.880
It's a holiday,
so that should be easy, right?

29:10.880 --> 29:12.040
Right.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.540
Okay. I'll send the nurse in
to sign you out.

29:14.540 --> 29:15.620
Thank you, Doctor.

29:20.170 --> 29:21.960
What'd I tell you, huh?
Everything's fine.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.290
Um, excuse me.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.210
I'm looking for my mom,
Delilah Dixon.

29:26.210 --> 29:28.920
Oh, yeah.
Your mom is in Room 4.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.170
She's fine.

29:30.170 --> 29:32.210
And the baby
is perfectly healthy.

29:32.210 --> 29:33.960
Go see her.
Go see your mom.

29:43.330 --> 29:46.420
Mom. Oh, my God.
I was so worried.

29:46.420 --> 29:48.120
Sophie, w-what
are you doing here?

29:48.120 --> 29:52.380
I -- I saw on my phone
that you were here, and...

29:52.380 --> 29:53.790
You're pregnant?

29:56.380 --> 29:58.460
Why didn't you tell me?

29:58.460 --> 30:00.120
I was gonna tell you.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.710
I...I was just trying
to find the right time,

30:02.710 --> 30:03.540
and -- and I wasn't --

30:05.620 --> 30:08.000
I wasn't sure
how you'd react.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.170
I mean, are you kidding?

30:14.170 --> 30:16.880
It's great.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.080
And if it's a boy,
then we should name him Jon.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.790
That's a great idea.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.750
Oh, Mom, can we tell
Danny the good news?

30:43.750 --> 30:45.170
Yes, of course.

30:53.330 --> 30:55.750
I'm sorry.

30:55.750 --> 30:58.290
I just -- I can't afford
to have her hate me right now.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.500
She just lost her dad.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.920
Maybe when she's 20,
she can hate me then,

31:01.920 --> 31:03.040
but right now, I just --

31:03.040 --> 31:04.670
You did the right thing.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.120
You should be there
when she tells Danny.

Jon usually made a speech,

32:55.500 --> 32:58.790

my thing, but, um...

32:58.790 --> 33:02.790

34:39.460 --> 34:41.420
No, there's got
to be a mistake.

No. No, I don't want
to interrupt the party.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.120
I'm just gonna call a ride.

35:18.580 --> 35:20.960
You know I'm your ride.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.420
Thank you for being here
with all of us today.

35:23.420 --> 35:26.250
Oh, thank you
for inviting me.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.040
Oh, almost forgot
my new scarf.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.420
Oh, I got a scarf just like that
for Ashley last Christmas.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.120
Oh. Must be
a very popular scarf.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.080
Well, let's
get you home, huh?

35:40.080 --> 35:40.830
Mm-hmm.
All right.

35:45.790 --> 35:47.420
Ashley, really?

35:47.420 --> 35:49.120
Here we go.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.250
Mm.

35:50.250 --> 35:51.330
I knew it.
See, I knew it.

35:51.330 --> 35:53.120
I knew that you couldn't
just be friends.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.500
Oh, no,
I can be your friend.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.920
Then why are you so upset?
I'm not upset.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.290
Of course you're upset.

35:57.290 --> 35:58.710
No, I'm not.
I'm not upset.

35:58.710 --> 35:59.830
Of course you're upset.
How could you not be upset?

35:59.830 --> 36:01.460
I slept with someone.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.380
I am aware.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.330
And you're upset.

36:04.420 --> 36:07.290
Please don't tell me
how I feel right now.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.500
You have no idea
what I am feeling.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.830
Okay, then, how about --
how about this?

36:10.830 --> 36:12.540
How about I tell you
how I'm feeling?

36:12.540 --> 36:15.080
You want to know why
I had sex with Ashley?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.670
Oh, God,
I don't know, Gary.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.080
Why?

36:18.080 --> 36:20.000
Because I'm
in love with you.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.670
Oh, no.

36:33.670 --> 36:36.040
Ohh, no.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.250
Ugh.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.380
I'm so sorry.

36:40.380 --> 36:42.790
This is your new car.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.750
Ugh.

36:57.830 --> 36:59.830
Oh, my God.

37:02.330 --> 37:03.710
Oh.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.330
Oh, my God.
You're doing chemo.

37:06.330 --> 37:08.830
You're doing chemo.

37:08.830 --> 37:10.500
You're doing chemo.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.120
Hey, uh, thanks
for dropping me off.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.290
This is your car,
your gas.

37:26.290 --> 37:28.540
It's literally
the least I could do.

37:28.540 --> 37:31.670
Now, listen, you are going
to crush this, okay?

37:31.670 --> 37:32.790
Put it on Instagram.

37:32.790 --> 37:34.750
I'll even consider
getting an account.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.670
Thanks for everything.

37:36.670 --> 37:38.880
Also...

37:38.880 --> 37:39.750
These people...

37:43.420 --> 37:45.080
I said these people.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.000
Whoa.
What, what, what, what?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.040
-Hey!
-Us, comin' out?

37:47.040 --> 37:48.380
-Hey!
-What?

37:48.380 --> 37:50.710
Yeah, go get some love.
Dude.

37:50.710 --> 37:53.540
Last chance, okay?
Last chance.
