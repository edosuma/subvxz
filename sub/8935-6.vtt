00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.603
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.603 --> 00:05.872
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.807 --> 00:10.143
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.778
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.313 --> 00:15.148
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.250
Yikes!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.085
Yaaaah...

00:22.122 --> 00:23.390
Yeaaaah!

00:23.390 --> 00:26.459
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.733 --> 00:36.436
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.771 --> 00:38.972
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.575 --> 00:44.978
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.979 --> 00:47.480
the Raccoons!!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.749
â™ª (show theme music) â™ª

01:01.895 --> 01:04.864
Although it seems like
a typical quiet afternoon

01:04.864 --> 01:06.266
in the Evergreen forest,

01:06.266 --> 01:08.735
something special is
about to happen.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.272
Something you look forward to
all year long.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.440
Just listen.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.911
Yay, school is over!

01:17.911 --> 01:19.746
Hey Bentley,
how did you do?

01:19.746 --> 01:23.216
I passed!
Summertime, here I come!

01:24.250 --> 01:25.885
But in another
part of the forest,

01:25.885 --> 01:30.256
summer holidays are the last
thing on Cyril Sneer's mind.

01:30.256 --> 01:33.359
Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, the future is now.

01:33.359 --> 01:36.229
Why pay workers, when
you can have robots?

01:36.229 --> 01:40.033
Just sign this contract
and step into tomorrow.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.102
Uh, Mr. Sneer...

01:42.102 --> 01:43.103
Need a pen?

01:43.103 --> 01:46.372
No. A demonstration!

01:46.372 --> 01:48.775
Now that's what
I got in mind, too!

01:48.775 --> 01:51.311
I'd like to see
this robotic system

01:51.311 --> 01:54.914
in operation... now!

01:54.914 --> 01:57.617
Always the shrewd
businessman, hey Knox?

01:57.617 --> 01:59.052
Well, it'll be a pleasure.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.256
To demonstrate the delicate work
these machines can do,

02:03.256 --> 02:05.992
I have the plant set up
for olive packing.

02:05.992 --> 02:09.062
And yes, you'll all get a
souvenir olive to take home.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.096
Ha-ha!

02:10.096 --> 02:13.700
Boys, initiate factory
automation program!

02:13.700 --> 02:16.469
See these babies?
Ever wonder how you can get

02:16.469 --> 02:18.004
the little red thing
in the olive?

02:18.004 --> 02:19.539
Heh! Well, I don't know either.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.941
And with the Sneer
Cybernetic Systems,

02:21.941 --> 02:23.510
you don't have to know.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.646
Just turn on the system,
and it'll do it for you!

02:27.580 --> 02:28.548
Brilliant, eh?

02:30.783 --> 02:31.985
I say, Sir!

02:34.087 --> 02:35.455
I say!

02:35.455 --> 02:36.689
Hey.. what?

02:36.689 --> 02:38.091
Can you hear me up there?

02:38.091 --> 02:40.293
What are you sweaty
saboteurs doing?!

02:40.293 --> 02:41.294
Yow!!!

02:41.294 --> 02:43.096
Panicking, Sir!

02:43.096 --> 02:45.698
There's something
wrong with the program!

02:45.698 --> 02:47.100
Fix it!!

02:50.203 --> 02:53.072
Ha-hah! Minor glitch
in the program, Knox,

02:53.072 --> 02:54.207
these things happen. Ha-ha!

02:54.207 --> 02:55.575
Uh-huh.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.745
Well, when you
fix the glitch,

02:58.745 --> 03:00.213
let me know.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.849
My new factory opens
in two days.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.584
It would be a shame,

03:04.584 --> 03:06.686
if I had to go elsewhere

03:06.686 --> 03:08.688
for my machinery.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.558
Uaaaah, help! Uaaah!

03:11.558 --> 03:13.026
Hey, Knox, wait!

03:13.026 --> 03:15.361
Don't you want your
souvenir, olive?

03:15.361 --> 03:16.829
Auuuu! Help!

03:16.829 --> 03:18.398
Uuh!

03:20.967 --> 03:21.501
Ohh, she's gonna be a

03:21.501 --> 03:24.904
Ohh, she's gonna be
a beauty! Right, Cedric?

03:25.004 --> 03:25.438
Finest canoe on

03:25.438 --> 03:26.873
Finest canoe
on the lake, Bert!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.408
Yahooo!

03:28.408 --> 03:31.711
School's out!
Whoopeee, I'm free!

03:31.711 --> 03:33.580
Look at my report card, Bert!

03:34.647 --> 03:37.150
Wow! Straight A's.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.319
Wow, way to go, Bentley!

03:39.319 --> 03:40.753
Congratulations, guy!

03:40.753 --> 03:44.157
Thanks, Cedric. And now
let's get started on summer!

03:44.157 --> 03:45.391
I don't want to waste a minute!

03:45.391 --> 03:47.026
We're not going
to waste a second!

03:47.026 --> 03:49.896
We're going to play
baseball and fly kites!

03:49.896 --> 03:53.099
And build tree forts,
and go to movie matinees...

03:53.099 --> 03:55.868
And swim and fish
and play 'Capture the flag'.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.538
Aoooh!

03:58.538 --> 04:02.108
And to start a whole
summer off with a bang!!

04:02.108 --> 04:07.080
Three daring explorers will set
off on the unmapped tributary

04:07.080 --> 04:09.215
of the Red Rock River!

04:09.215 --> 04:11.918
This is going to be
the best summer in history!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.553
No way guys,

04:13.553 --> 04:15.388
this is gonna be...

04:15.388 --> 04:18.458
THREE of the best
summers in history!!

04:20.793 --> 04:22.795
I gotta a few
things to do, guys.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.632
What do you say, we finish up
the canoe in the morning?

04:25.632 --> 04:27.734
Okay, Cedric. See ya!

04:27.734 --> 04:30.403
Hey, Bert,
you gotta come with me!

04:30.403 --> 04:31.871
Wait'll you see what I got!

04:33.473 --> 04:35.908
Are you sure you don't
want me to help out, Pop?

04:35.908 --> 04:39.078
No, son. You go and
enjoy your camping trip.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.914
Well, okay Pop. See ya!

04:42.982 --> 04:44.117
Why me?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.953
Pig 1: Well, boss,
maybe it's because...

04:46.953 --> 04:49.922
That was a rhetorical
question, dimbulb!

04:49.922 --> 04:51.624
just fix the system.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.260
Pig 2: We're running
a diagnostic program

04:54.260 --> 04:56.429
on the control system, boss.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.532
Pig 3: Ho-ho, we'll have it up
and running in no time.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.402
I've invested millions
in this robotics company,

05:02.402 --> 05:03.469
and what do I get?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.805
An olive in the ear!

05:05.805 --> 05:08.007
I don't close
that deal with Knox,

05:08.007 --> 05:10.109
you three
thimble brains will suffer!

05:10.109 --> 05:11.277
Capeesh?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.149
Pig 3: There! That should do it!

05:16.149 --> 05:17.550
Enter!

05:17.550 --> 05:19.152
Yaaaaaaah!

05:19.152 --> 05:21.187
Pig 1: It's alive!

05:21.187 --> 05:22.055
Boss!!

05:22.055 --> 05:23.389
Wreck any
of that equipment,

05:23.389 --> 05:25.325
and it's coming out
of your salary!!

05:25.325 --> 05:26.826
Uaaaah!

05:29.996 --> 05:32.799
How do you turn this
dad-blasted thing off?

05:32.799 --> 05:33.366
Pig 2: The red--

05:35.034 --> 05:37.203
Not that you're worth
saving, you understand?

05:39.472 --> 05:41.107
Pig 2: The red switch!

05:41.107 --> 05:43.843
Oh, yes! The red switch!

05:43.843 --> 05:48.481
The red switch... Ohh, boys,
boys, oh, let me see.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.683
Where... where is the red switch?

05:54.120 --> 05:55.355
Oooh-oh-oh!

05:55.355 --> 05:58.725
Pig 1: I think we know
the problem now, boss.

05:58.725 --> 05:59.726
So do I!

05:59.726 --> 06:00.893
Oooh-oh-oh!

06:00.893 --> 06:01.928
It's you, three!

06:01.928 --> 06:04.464
Now, get this
factory back online,

06:04.464 --> 06:06.432
or you'll be in the
unemployment line!

06:07.734 --> 06:10.036
Capeesh?
Capeesh!

06:10.803 --> 06:13.306
Oooh, let's face it, fellas,

06:13.306 --> 06:16.876
we need an expert
troubleshooter to help us.

06:16.876 --> 06:21.347
Pig 2: Where are we gonna
find an expert on short notice?

06:22.415 --> 06:25.184
Pig 3: That's it!
A short expert!

06:25.184 --> 06:27.253
Come on, boys!

06:27.253 --> 06:30.890
Pig 1: Hey, wait up! Guys...?

06:32.191 --> 06:33.760
Thank you, Mr. Willow!
See you, Mr Willow.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.698
Wow! A pair of
Thompson's Gazelle
Leapers!

06:38.698 --> 06:40.366
The best
running shoes going.

06:40.366 --> 06:41.968
And boy do they go!

06:41.968 --> 06:43.870
There's nothing
like a brand new

06:43.870 --> 06:45.772
pair of runners
to start the summer!

06:45.772 --> 06:48.040
Do you know how fast I
can run in these shoes, Bert?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.308
How fast?

06:49.308 --> 06:52.412
The speed of light, and
I can jump as high as the trees!

06:52.412 --> 06:54.013
I bet I can even jump across

06:54.013 --> 06:55.715
Evergreen Lake.
No!

06:55.715 --> 06:57.450
There's a whole
summer's running

06:57.450 --> 06:58.951
packed into these shoes, Bert!

06:58.951 --> 07:01.421
About a million miles worth!

07:01.421 --> 07:04.056
So put 'em on! Put 'em on!

07:04.056 --> 07:05.158
Not yet!

07:05.725 --> 07:08.995
You see, you gotta wait
until summer really starts.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.963
And ours won't really
start until we put

07:10.963 --> 07:12.999
that canoe in the water.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.001
You know, little buddy,

07:15.001 --> 07:17.637
you've got a great
sense of tradition!

07:26.145 --> 07:28.614
Oh! Hi, guys!
What can I do for you?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.249
Pig 1: More to
the point, Bentley,

07:30.249 --> 07:32.652
what can we do for you?

07:32.652 --> 07:35.655
Pig 2: A future in
the world of business!

07:35.655 --> 07:38.858
Pig 3: An opportunity that's
knocking on your door.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.993
Pig 1: Open that door, Bentley!

07:40.993 --> 07:43.262
Open it and come on in!

07:43.262 --> 07:47.567
Pig 2: 'Cause remember,
opportunity knocks but once!

07:48.534 --> 07:51.237
Guys, what
are you talking about?

07:52.371 --> 07:56.409
You know, Bentley's never
been on a canoe trip before.

07:56.409 --> 07:59.946
Oh wow, I we gonna
show him a good time!

08:02.648 --> 08:05.017
I'll get it. Hello?

08:05.017 --> 08:07.787
Ohh hiya, Bentley! What's up?

08:07.787 --> 08:09.922
Pig 1: Tell him. Tell him!!

08:09.922 --> 08:12.725
Um, it's about
the canoe trip, Bert.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.096
Actually, it's about
the whole summer.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.130
You see, I...

08:18.831 --> 08:21.701
Oh! I-I see.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.904
Oh no, no, it's fine.

08:24.904 --> 08:27.440
Congratulations, little buddy.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.676
That was Bentley.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.312
He... he took a job.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.847
For the whole summer!

08:44.657 --> 08:46.492
And he agreed?!

08:46.492 --> 08:48.060
Correct me if I'm wrong,

08:48.060 --> 08:52.298
but yesterday was the last
day of school, wasn't it?

08:52.298 --> 08:55.735
Pig 1: We'd never correct you
if you were wrong, boss.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.738
Pig 2: He knows this
is a rare opportunity

08:58.738 --> 09:01.007
for hands on experience.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.743
Pig 3: It's an important first
step on his career path.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.378
You sound like
you've been reading

09:05.378 --> 09:07.079
those matchbook covers again.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.751
Well, a major initiative of
such magnificent proportions

09:11.751 --> 09:13.219
deserves a raise!

09:13.219 --> 09:16.155
Ohh, we think so too boss!

09:16.155 --> 09:18.658
And a high-powered
position to go along with it.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.726
Oooooh! Whoopeee!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.895
How does
Assistant Director

09:22.895 --> 09:24.597
of Engineering
Development sound?

09:24.597 --> 09:28.167
Like a dream
come true, boss?

09:28.167 --> 09:30.236
I'm sure, Bentley
will feel the same.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.972
I'll go give him the good news.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.475
Pig1: Oh, dandy, just dandy!!

09:36.475 --> 09:38.878
We got the brainstorm
of hiring Bentley,

09:38.878 --> 09:40.947
and he gets a raise!

09:42.448 --> 09:45.117
I can't believe,
he'd do this to us!

09:45.117 --> 09:46.419
Now be fair, Bert.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.356
It is a good job. And Bentley's
only thinking of his future.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.025
Yeah, well,
as far as I'm concerned,

09:53.025 --> 09:56.562
the future doesn't start
'til after the summer's over!

09:58.397 --> 10:00.433
We might as well put
our canoe in the water.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.404
Boy, are we going to
have some fun, huh Cedric?

10:05.404 --> 10:06.539
Well, yeah...

10:06.539 --> 10:10.343
Only, somehow it's not quite
the same without Bentley.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.144
Have a look
at this one, Mr Sneer.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.821
Brilliant,
Bentley. Brilliant!!

10:21.821 --> 10:24.657
I'd have been in big trouble
without you, my boy.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.126
It wasn't much. Just a
little error in the program.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.629
Those little errors
are the ones that creep up

10:29.629 --> 10:31.998
in the dark of night
and bite you in the neck!

10:31.998 --> 10:32.832
Know what I mean?

10:32.832 --> 10:35.001
We could have
fixed that, boss!

10:35.001 --> 10:37.570
Hah! You three
couldn't fix lunch.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.805
Get out of here.
You're disturbing Bentley!

10:39.805 --> 10:42.274
No, it's okay.
Really, Mr. Sneer?

10:42.274 --> 10:44.010
Well, they're
disturbing me!

10:44.543 --> 10:47.647
I knew those porkers spelt
trouble the minute I laid eyes...

10:48.147 --> 10:51.617
Ohh, there
goes the Wonder Boy!

10:51.617 --> 10:54.987
Pig 2: Hm, little
Mr. Expert. La-di-daa!

10:54.987 --> 10:58.190
Pig 1: And we're just dirt
under the boss's feet!!

10:58.190 --> 11:00.493
Pig 3: The soap ring on his tub!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.795
Pig 2: The grey spot on his tie.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.033
Pig 1: Well, we're not
going to stand for it!

11:07.033 --> 11:09.802
We brought Bentley
into the organization,

11:09.802 --> 11:11.871
so we've got to push him out!

11:12.638 --> 11:14.173
For our own good!

11:14.173 --> 11:16.275
Great way to spend
the summer, eh Bentley?

11:16.275 --> 11:19.311
Uhm, fiddling with computers,

11:19.311 --> 11:21.113
earning a little cold cash?

11:21.113 --> 11:22.848
And it'll
look great on my resume.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.519
I'll have the system debugged
before Mr Knox's deadline!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.387
Great! But don't worry,

11:28.387 --> 11:30.489
there'll be plenty more
for you to do around here

11:30.489 --> 11:31.824
the rest of the summer.

11:31.824 --> 11:35.227
Oh! Well,
that's great, Mr Sneer.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.330
Yeah. Well,
keep up the good work, son!

11:40.866 --> 11:43.202
There,
chew on that for a while!

11:51.243 --> 11:53.679
Okay, let's go for it.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.048
Oh-ho!

11:56.048 --> 11:59.351
Hey, look at me!
I'm Gary Lee Shoeless!

12:01.153 --> 12:02.888
Pig 2: Can you believe it?

12:02.888 --> 12:04.990
That little smarty pants

12:04.990 --> 12:07.426
worked out the solution already!

12:08.360 --> 12:10.596
Won't this come in handy!

12:10.596 --> 12:12.031
Heh-heh!

12:12.031 --> 12:15.668
Pig 3: Let's see boy-genius
debug this mess!

12:17.737 --> 12:20.372
Imaginary Bert:

12:20.372 --> 12:22.141
We're not gonna waste a second!

12:22.141 --> 12:23.776
We're gonna play baseball

12:23.776 --> 12:25.277
and fly kites!

12:25.277 --> 12:28.114
Imaginary Cedric: And build tree
forts and go to movie matinees!

12:28.114 --> 12:31.217
...and swim and fish and
play 'Capture the flag'.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.685
Ugh!

12:32.685 --> 12:35.654
This is going to be
the best summer in history!

12:35.654 --> 12:50.136
â™ª (sentimental music) â™ª

13:05.217 --> 13:08.320
â™ª
Cedric/Bert:

13:14.426 --> 13:16.595
â™ª
Cedric/Bert:

13:16.595 --> 13:29.675
â™ª
Uaaaah!

13:29.675 --> 13:32.311
â™ª
Bert/Bentley:

13:32.311 --> 13:49.395
â™ª
Uaaaaaah!

13:49.395 --> 13:51.697
â™ª
Aaaaaaaah!

14:10.382 --> 14:11.283
Ohh no!

14:11.283 --> 14:12.985
Oooh!

14:12.985 --> 14:16.856
Looks like we did
too good a job.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.325
What's happening?
Bentley!?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.531
Darned bucket of bolts
almost creamed me!

14:27.533 --> 14:28.334
Bentley!!!

14:28.334 --> 14:30.236
Now, Mr Sneer,

14:30.236 --> 14:32.872
I-I-I can explain!

14:33.739 --> 14:35.774
Just about set, Cedric.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.344
I hope we're not leaving
anything behind.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.579
Just Bentley, I guess.

14:40.579 --> 14:41.580
Hey, guys!

14:41.580 --> 14:43.482
Oh yeah. Bentley.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.317
Poor little guy.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.887
Hey, guys, wait for me!
Bert/Cedric: What?!

14:47.887 --> 14:49.989
Well, we haven't
got all summer, you know?

14:49.989 --> 14:52.191
Let's get this show on the road!

14:52.191 --> 14:53.792
Um, Bentley...

14:53.792 --> 14:57.496
What.. what about your job?
What about it?

14:58.530 --> 15:01.033
I was fired. No big deal.

15:01.433 --> 15:02.534
Let's go!

15:03.869 --> 15:08.407
And the last interrupt
vector initial video mode.

15:08.407 --> 15:12.912
Zero one equals
40 times 25 colour, 10.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.747
Or is that a 70?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.615
Pig 2: Bentley is a genius,

15:16.615 --> 15:20.252
but he should pay more
attention to his handwriting.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.620
How's it going, boys?

15:21.620 --> 15:24.356
Pig 2: Oh, just
tickety- boo, boss.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.026
We'll have this factory
running in no time.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.328
Great! Great!

15:29.328 --> 15:31.397
Well, I won't hold
you responsible

15:31.397 --> 15:33.632
for that Bentley fiasco.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.067
Carry on, boys,

15:35.067 --> 15:36.969
you're doing fabulous work!

15:37.703 --> 15:39.305
Thanks, boss!

15:40.572 --> 15:44.176
Pig 3: But it's Bentley who
should really get the credit.

15:45.077 --> 15:48.113
Oh, the boss really
chewed him out, too.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.216
Pig 3: I hate to admit it,
but I feel guilty

15:51.216 --> 15:54.253
for deep-sixing Bentley.

15:54.253 --> 15:57.323
Pig 1: And he's such a nice kid.

16:00.826 --> 16:01.961
Pig 1: We're no good!

16:01.961 --> 16:04.663
We're backstabbing, stinkers!

16:04.663 --> 16:06.565
Pig 2: You almost
feel like confessing

16:06.565 --> 16:09.802
the whole sordid
story to the boss!

16:09.802 --> 16:10.769
Hello, boys!

16:11.770 --> 16:13.439
Knox will be around
in the morning.

16:13.439 --> 16:14.940
Pig 1: We did it, boss!

16:14.940 --> 16:19.778
We messed up the computer,
not Bentleyyyy!!

16:19.778 --> 16:22.114
Pig 3: Are you crazy?

16:22.114 --> 16:25.150
Aren't our lives
miserable enough?

16:25.150 --> 16:28.487
Anything else you'd like to
confess while you're at it?

16:28.487 --> 16:31.490
How about the dent we
put in the limo? Hmm?

16:31.490 --> 16:35.527
Oh, why don't you tell him about
the time we sold his cigars?

16:35.527 --> 16:37.096
Well now...

16:37.096 --> 16:38.330
do go on!

16:38.330 --> 16:41.367
Pig 3: Oh-oh-oh!
Come on, tell all!

16:41.367 --> 16:44.536
Pig 1: But you... you said

16:44.536 --> 16:47.272
you wanted to confess.

16:47.272 --> 16:51.010
Pig 2: Almost!! We said we
almost wanted to confess.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.979
We didn't say we actually
wanted to confess!

16:58.517 --> 17:00.953
Of all the two-faced,
filthy, lying,

17:00.953 --> 17:02.855
twisted things I have done,

17:02.855 --> 17:05.391
I have never stooped
as low as you three

17:05.391 --> 17:08.560
malicious mud wallowers!!
No, boss!

17:08.560 --> 17:09.828
Poor little Bentley.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.563
He must feel lousy.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.565
And the things I said to him.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.734
I hope you're proud
of yourselves.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.836
We're not, boss.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.042
Where there's smoke,
there's a campfire.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.845
We found them!
Ohh, good work, boss.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.349
Hey, Bentley, I
thought you were going to peel

17:30.349 --> 17:32.351
some potatoes for supper.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.720
Yeah, I'll get to it.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.189
So, uh... how
you feeling, Bentley?

17:37.189 --> 17:38.190
How do you think?!

17:38.190 --> 17:41.093
I just got fired from
my very first job!

17:41.093 --> 17:43.062
Cheer up, little buddy.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.364
You'll be fired from other jobs!

17:46.198 --> 17:47.933
Not helping, Bert.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.835
Heard enough to apologize

17:49.835 --> 17:52.271
without putting
your life on the line.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.574
If you feel a tug,
haul me up, pronto!

17:55.574 --> 17:56.875
Yes, Sir!

17:56.875 --> 17:57.876
Yeah!

17:59.578 --> 18:02.815
Oh! Ah!...Oh! Ah!

18:02.815 --> 18:04.249
Darn galoots!

18:04.249 --> 18:07.052
Can't even figure out
which way is down.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.288
And how do you think
getting fired from my first job

18:09.288 --> 18:11.223
is going to look
on the old resume?

18:11.223 --> 18:13.559
I'll probably never
get another job again.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.594
I'll never be able
to pay the mortgage.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.429
Mortgage?!

18:17.429 --> 18:19.064
I'll end up
living in a tent.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.401
Pig 1: There's the signal!
Haul him up!

18:22.401 --> 18:25.471
And my car. How will I
keep up with my car payments?

18:25.471 --> 18:28.240
Uh, you don't
have a car, Bentley.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.075
Yeah, but
I've got to get one.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.846
I might as well face it.
My whole life is ruined.

18:35.914 --> 18:40.152
Pig 2: Boy, the boss is really
putting on the old lard.

18:41.587 --> 18:44.389
I think you're going a bit
overboard with this, Bentley.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.892
I mean, you're just a kid.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.093
You don't know
what it's like to be

18:48.093 --> 18:49.761
a kid these days, Bert.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.230
You've got to get ahead

18:51.230 --> 18:52.798
before it's too late.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.733
Pig 1: Ohh!
Pig 2: Give it more power!!

18:54.733 --> 18:56.568
Pig 1: Oh, wait a second.

18:58.437 --> 19:01.140
Hey, I'll bet if you had
those brand new sneakers on,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
you'd feel a whole lot better!

19:03.142 --> 19:06.578
Then, not even Cyril Sneer
could wreck your summer.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.283
It's already
too late, Bert.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.252
My summer's all washed up.

19:13.252 --> 19:17.789
Pig 1: Oh! I think
we just about got it.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.195
Yikes!

19:23.195 --> 19:24.863
Cedric/Bert: Look out!

19:24.863 --> 19:28.167
All right, everyone!
Into the canoe!!
Pop?

19:36.875 --> 19:38.544
Bert/Cedric:

19:38.544 --> 19:39.878
Well, that
was a close one!

19:39.878 --> 19:41.847
Good thing I was
in the neighborhood!

19:41.847 --> 19:45.784
Yeah, Pop, but what are
you doing in the neighborhood?

19:45.784 --> 19:48.954
We haven't got time
to find out now, Cedric!

19:48.954 --> 19:51.523
White wateeeerrr!

19:53.392 --> 19:54.993
Uaaaaaaaah!

20:02.834 --> 20:08.073
Yahoooo!

20:09.041 --> 20:12.377
Hooo! Now that was a ride!

20:12.377 --> 20:15.747
(chuckles) I haven't
done that since I was a kid!

20:17.015 --> 20:18.750
Speaking of which, Bentley,

20:18.750 --> 20:20.352
you're off the hook!

20:20.352 --> 20:23.855
That whole computer mess
wasn't your fault at all.

20:23.855 --> 20:26.658
It wasn't?
I can have my old job back?

20:26.658 --> 20:28.393
Of course not!

20:28.393 --> 20:31.396
Never should have hired
you in the first place!

20:31.396 --> 20:33.332
You're supposed to
enjoy the summer!

20:33.332 --> 20:35.767
You'll have plenty of
time to be a grown up.

20:36.602 --> 20:40.305
You know, I always wondered
where this river went?

20:40.305 --> 20:42.074
Ah, w-w-when we come back,

20:42.074 --> 20:44.610
we'll tell you all about it!
Cyril. Okay?

20:44.610 --> 20:48.680
Relax, Raccoon! I've got
no intention of going with you.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.216
I've had my summers.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.785
Time has
always been a mystery.

20:53.785 --> 20:57.589
A dull, rainy day can
seem to last forever.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.292
On blue skied afternoons,
time just seems to

21:00.292 --> 21:02.060
fly away on the wind.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.230
But the most wonderful
time of all is summertime.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.768
Keep at it,
you lowlife loin chops!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.737
You blanked out the memory bank,

21:11.737 --> 21:13.939
so you can fill it up again!

21:13.939 --> 21:16.575
Pig 1: 400,000 pages!

21:16.575 --> 21:19.211
Hoo-hoo! What page are you on?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.213
Pig 3: Uh...3.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.547
Pig 2: Ooooh!

21:22.547 --> 21:26.752
Now I know what they mean
by a long, hot summer!

21:26.752 --> 21:29.154
Ready Bentley?
Just about.

21:29.921 --> 21:31.423
Ta-daaaaa!

21:31.423 --> 21:34.326
Oh, wow!
How do they feel, Bentley?

21:34.326 --> 21:35.994
They feel...

21:35.994 --> 21:39.631
they feel like summer's
just started!

21:39.631 --> 21:40.832
Let's go!

21:40.832 --> 21:43.335
Yahoooo!

21:45.070 --> 21:45.671
â™ª (show theme music) â™ª

21:47.973 --> 22:01.353
â™ª When darkness falls â™ª

22:01.353 --> 22:04.456
â™ª Leaving shadows in the night â™ª

22:04.456 --> 22:07.959
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

22:07.959 --> 22:11.530
â™ª Wipe that fear from
your eyes â™ª

22:11.530 --> 22:15.000
â™ª The desperate love â™ª

22:15.000 --> 22:18.603
â™ª Keeps on driving you wrong â™ª

22:18.603 --> 22:22.874
â™ª Don't be afraid â™ª

22:22.874 --> 22:24.609
â™ª You're not alone â™ª

22:24.609 --> 22:28.213
â™ª You can run with us â™ª

22:28.213 --> 22:33.819
â™ª We've got everything
you need â™ª

22:33.819 --> 22:35.287
â™ª Run with us â™ª

22:35.287 --> 22:39.057
â™ª We are free â™ª

22:39.057 --> 22:42.227
â™ª Come with us â™ª

22:42.227 --> 22:47.699
â™ª I see passion in your eyes â™ª

22:47.699 --> 22:49.468
â™ª Run with us â™ª
