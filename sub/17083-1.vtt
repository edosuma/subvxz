00:59.476 --> 01:02.025
Bare-ass naked with
his socks still on?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.155
Yeah, they do it
like that up north.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.783
What for? Protective purposes.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.036
- Ask me.
- Ask Jack.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.164
It's his old stamping ground.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.924
Must be a bloody contortionist.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.562
Oh, not suede boots.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.020
- Knock it off, Gerald.
- What, and get the clap?

01:59.745 --> 02:03.170
We don't want you to
go up the north, Jack.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.218
No?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.553
You work for us, Jack.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.553
You know we're connected
with the Newcastle mob.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.805
I'd hate you to screw it up.

02:16.762 --> 02:17.934
What's that, a python?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.063
What you going for?

02:29.566 --> 02:30.863
To find out what happened.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.996
Look, your brother's dead and gone.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.740
They're hard nuts up there, Jack.

02:36.948 --> 02:41.579
They won't take kindly to someone
from London poking his nose in.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.834
Too bad.

02:43.038 --> 02:47.589
Remember, they're
killers just like you.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.679
The police seem satisfied.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.473
Since when was that good enough?

02:56.093 --> 02:58.437
Think again, Jack.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.935
I will.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.283
Pint of bitter.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.281
In a thin glass.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.184
Mr. Carter?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.774
Is there a Mr. Carter in the room?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.436
Yeah.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.580
Hello? Margaret?

08:12.951 --> 08:15.249
Why the hell aren't you here?

08:19.541 --> 08:21.168
What time?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.259
Is Doreen at the house?

08:27.465 --> 08:29.593
Who's with him, then?

08:31.511 --> 08:35.436
When can I see you?
Will you be there tomorrow?

08:35.640 --> 08:36.687
Now listen, Mar...

11:56.174 --> 11:59.394
- I won't be using the room tonight.
- I see.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.020
I'm staying with a friend.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.858
- Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
- It's not like that, love.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.061
It never is.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.568
- Are you a traveler?
- Definitely.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.620
- Will this do?
- Yes.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.868
Very nice. Very nice.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.077
- I'll pay you for tonight as well.
- Don't be bloody silly.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.628
You're the first since Monday.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.957
- You sure?
- Ta.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.169
I bet this has seen
some action, hasn't it?

12:33.378 --> 12:36.177
I'll give you the key
when you come down.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.458
Was he in bad shape?

13:13.584 --> 13:15.586
They come worse.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.789
Doreen. All right, are you?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.338
Been staying with a friend?

13:57.295 --> 13:59.718
I'm sorry about your father.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.226
Tell me, Doreen...

14:07.388 --> 14:09.937
did the police say anything?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.943
They said he was drunk.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.745
- How's school?
- I left last year.

14:26.908 --> 14:31.084
- Oh. What are you doing now?
- Working at Woolworths.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.382
- That must be very interesting.
- Yes.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.547
What are you gonna do?
Live with Margaret?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.844
Well, why won't you come
with us to South America?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.180
My fiancÃ©e wouldn't mind.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.641
And that's how your dad
would have liked it.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.021
Get Hubert up, will you?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.778
We're ready now, sir.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.058
We weren't sure where it was
taking place, you know.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.393
- Nice of you to come.
- Oh, Frank was a good bloke.

15:34.600 --> 15:38.070
- He was that.
- One of the best.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.380
- I couldn't believe it when I heard.
- What?

15:59.542 --> 16:02.136
I mean, I was surprised when
he didn't turn up for work.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.213
He was always on time.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.221
- Did you work with him, Keith?
- At the Half Moon.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.098
It's a bloody funny
thing, you know.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.434
You work with a bloke
for six bloody years...

16:12.638 --> 16:15.482
and all the time he's as
calm as gentle Jesus.

16:15.683 --> 16:20.359
Then he goes and does a thing
like that. Bloody funny thing.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.567
Yeah, a bloody funny thing.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.553
<i>Will you all stand up, please?</i>

16:47.215 --> 16:50.890
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy...

16:51.093 --> 16:55.644
to take unto himself the soul of
our dear brother here departed...

16:55.848 --> 16:59.648
we therefore commit his body
to be consumed by fire...

16:59.810 --> 17:03.485
in sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life...

17:03.648 --> 17:06.070
through our Lord, Jesus Christ.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.453
Who shall change the
body of our low estate.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.201
- Is that Margaret?
- Yes.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.032
Who shall change the body
of our low estate...

17:14.242 --> 17:16.790
that it may be like unto
his glorious body...

17:16.993 --> 17:19.247
according to the mighty working...

17:19.454 --> 17:24.006
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.870
Margaret?

17:56.200 --> 18:00.455
- I thought you weren't coming.
- Changed my mind.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.212
- Everything go off all right, then?
- Fine.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.542
I wanna talk to you.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.923
- What about?
- Doreen.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.932
She's nothing to do with me.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.183
What do you mean?

18:13.384 --> 18:16.354
You've been Frank's bird ever
since her mother cleared off.

18:16.554 --> 18:21.776
- You're closer to her than anyone.
- No, no, it's not like that.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.320
I've got a husband, you know.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.858
Hold it. Hold it.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.702
Who killed Frank, Margaret?

18:31.902 --> 18:33.575
Killed?

18:34.071 --> 18:36.199
I don't know anything about it.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.416
- Really?
- I must go. I'm in a hurry.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.089
I wanna talk to you later.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.672
- I can't.
- Tomorrow morning, then.

18:46.959 --> 18:51.840
Well, all right, then,
12:00 on the Iron Bridge.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.852
Dinner.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.402
Well, absent friends.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.491
You don't suppose he might
have done it on purpose.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.919
- What? You mean like kill himself?
- Hmm.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.457
No, Frank kill himself? Get away.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.507
- I mean, what for?
- That's what I was wondering.

19:29.669 --> 19:33.674
Oh, come off it. Frank
was, well, straight.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.055
He had no worries I know of.
It would have showed.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.227
Why would it?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.021
Just would. That's all.

19:41.222 --> 19:45.648
- Frank was always the same.
- Since when?

19:45.851 --> 19:49.572
- Did Frank drink whiskey?
- I don't know.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.616
No, nobody seems to know.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.240
He was a bloody good bloke.
One of the best.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.947
How would you know, or you, or you?

19:58.155 --> 20:01.910
None of you knew!
I knew! He was my dad!

20:02.118 --> 20:05.213
Okay, okay, okay.
Let her go. Let her go.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.341
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, don't worry.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.215
She's bound to be upset.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.848
- Let's have another drink.
- No, I must be off. I should be at work.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.721
Well, look, look.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.558
Get your suit cleaned.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.352
- That's all right.
- Oh, come on.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.936
- Thanks for coming, Eddie.
- Frank was a good bloke.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.272
It's the least I could have done.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.661
- Do you work here, Keith?
- Yeah.

20:44.869 --> 20:49.500
If anyone comes in and asks for
me, you let me know, right?

20:49.707 --> 20:54.178
- Yeah, all right.
- I'm at the Las Vegas behind the dance hall.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.219
Do you know a man
called Albert Swift?

21:00.384 --> 21:02.887
Yeah, he comes in here a bit.

21:03.095 --> 21:07.771
- Where would I find him?
- Today? At the races. He always goes.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.900
- How come you know Albert?
- I went to school with him.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.947
He'll know what's going
on in this town.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.319
Gray suits you, Eric.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.577
- Good God.
- Is he?

22:41.777 --> 22:46.658
- Jack, Jack Carter.
- Eric, Eric Paice.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.413
What you doing around here, then?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.791
- Didn't you know this is my hometown?
- No, I didn't know that.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.791
Funny that, isn't it?

22:56.750 --> 22:58.468
Thanks.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.555
So, what you doing, then?
On your holidays?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.634
- No, I'm visiting relatives.
- Well, that's nice.

23:04.842 --> 23:07.095
It would be if they
were still living.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.978
- Meaning what?
- Bereavement, death in the family.

23:11.140 --> 23:14.861
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- That's all right, Eric.

23:18.522 --> 23:25.076
- Oh, well, small world, isn't it?
- Very.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.375
So who are you working
for these days, Eric?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.953
Oh, I'm straight. Respectable.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.879
- What are you doing?
- Hmm?

23:35.039 --> 23:36.837
Advertising martini?

23:37.041 --> 23:40.762
- Oh, you've been watching television?
- Yeah.

23:43.547 --> 23:47.142
Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

23:48.594 --> 23:51.438
- Brumby?
- You're serious? Heh.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.312
Kinnear?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.276
What's it to you, anyway?

23:55.476 --> 23:59.071
Well, I've always had your
welfare at heart, Eric.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.069
Besides which, I'm nosy.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.617
Well, that's not always a
healthy way to be, is it?

24:03.817 --> 24:05.945
- And you should know...
- Hmm?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.613
If I remember rightly.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.827
Heh, oh, yeah.

24:11.659 --> 24:15.880
So you're doing all
right, then, Eric?

24:16.413 --> 24:17.915
You're making good?

24:18.123 --> 24:20.251
- Making a living.
- Yeah.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.212
Good prospects for
advancement, is there, huh?

24:23.420 --> 24:24.637
A pension?

24:32.513 --> 24:38.395
Do you know, I'd almost forgotten
what your eyes looked like.

24:42.773 --> 24:47.404
They're still the same.
Piss-holes in the snow.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.248
- Still got a sense of humor.
- Yeah.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.122
Yes, I retained that, Eric.

24:56.954 --> 25:02.211
Do you know a man called
Albert Swift, Eric?

25:02.418 --> 25:04.216
Can't say I do.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.514
Don't miss the start on my account.

25:16.765 --> 25:22.522
<i>Pine Lodge, 9-to-4 favorite.
Seventeen, Treasure Quest, 14-to-1.</i>

25:22.730 --> 25:25.529
<i>Sixteen, Sure Arrow, 20-to-1.</i>

25:37.244 --> 25:43.047
<i>Number six, Country Lad,
13-to-2. Five...</i>

27:20.472 --> 27:22.065
Come here.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.568
Hey!

27:45.164 --> 27:46.666
- Carter's here.
- Where?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.550
- Don't know.
- You stupid shit!

27:48.709 --> 27:50.632
- What?
- Who?

27:52.296 --> 27:55.140
See what it's like
these days, Jack?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.434
You can't get the material.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.636
Yes, I can see your problem,
Mr. Kinnear.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.348
- Sit down, Jack.
- Thank you.

28:02.556 --> 28:06.311
I could weep. I really could.

28:06.518 --> 28:10.148
Sometimes I think I'll retire and
just piss off to the Bahamas...

28:10.355 --> 28:12.107
and let somebody else employ them.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.910
Glenda, get Jack a drink.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.455
- What is it, Jack?
- Scotch, please.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.907
Piss off, Ray.

28:25.996 --> 28:29.842
Eric, uh, told me of
your bereavement.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.213
Yeah.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.891
Do you know, I never knew he
worked at one of my places?

28:38.050 --> 28:41.224
No. It's funny, though.
Neither did I.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.105
If I'd known, I'd have fixed
him up with something better.

28:44.306 --> 28:45.478
Yeah.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.894
Nasty way to go.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.026
Yes.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.492
Are we here to play cards
or talk about the old days?

28:55.692 --> 28:57.319
Harry.

28:57.527 --> 29:02.249
Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these
men have brought a lot of money with them.

29:02.449 --> 29:06.579
Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack
a drink in those piddling little glasses.

29:06.787 --> 29:09.256
Give him the bloody bottle.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.833
Now where are we?

29:13.210 --> 29:17.966
- Oh, I think I'll stay as I am.
- You're bluffing, you bastard.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.643
That's what you pay to
find out. Right, Jack?

29:21.843 --> 29:25.848
- Right, if you can afford it.
- I thought you were going soon.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.517
Soon, when you've lost
your money. Won't take long.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.982
- Clever sod, aren't you?
- Only comparatively.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.779
Harry, I don't like to push...

29:32.980 --> 29:36.029
but could you let us know
how much your hand's worth?

29:36.233 --> 29:38.235
I'm taking two.

29:39.820 --> 29:44.200
- Do you know Sid Fletcher?
- What?

29:44.408 --> 29:47.161
- You know Sid Fletcher?
- Here's two.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.087
I work for him.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.541
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.502
Hundred.

29:58.922 --> 30:01.801
- What's that, 100?
- That's right, Harry.

30:01.967 --> 30:06.222
- I'm out.
- Your hundred, another hundred.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.933
- I know him too.
- Another hundred.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.438
- Who?
- Sid Fletcher.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.103
- Another hundred, Harry.
- Do you?

30:13.270 --> 30:14.692
Mm-hm.

30:14.855 --> 30:17.483
- Do you really know Sid Fletcher?
- Two hundred and another.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.944
I know Sid Fletcher.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.208
What's that?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.672
Two hundred.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.675
I'll follow that.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.050
- Two hundred.
- Yes.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.679
I met him last year.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.353
- All right, and another 200.
- Oh, yes.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.430
When he came up on business.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.689
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.193
- I don't know, what shall I do?
- He came to see Mr. Kinnear.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.690
Now.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.068
- Is that 200?
- Did he?

30:57.272 --> 30:58.945
That's right, Harry.

30:59.149 --> 31:04.121
- You can always see me if you want to.
- All right.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.162
Your 200 and another 200.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.373
Tsk. Ah.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.340
- What's that?
- Six hundred pounds, Harry.

31:22.547 --> 31:27.644
Two hundred to follow you.
And now I've raised it 400.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.314
- Four hundred?
- That's right, Harry.

31:31.515 --> 31:35.486
- You're not seeing me?
- No.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.446
All right, I'll see you.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.948
- Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
- Yeah.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.746
We went about together.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.657
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.326
While he was here.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.457
While he was here you
went about together.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.789
He was here for four days.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.707
- Was he?
- Uh-huh.

31:58.333 --> 32:03.430
- Would you do me a favor?
- Yeah, I'll do you a favor.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.725
Would you please put
my glass on the table?

32:11.680 --> 32:15.150
Come on, Harry.
I haven't won, have I?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.148
Go on, you're pulling my leg.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.483
What about that, Jack?

32:22.691 --> 32:27.413
- Old Harry thought I was having him on.
- Shut up.

32:28.989 --> 32:33.244
- Not going, Jack?
- I have to. Things to do.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.875
Of course. Of course.

32:36.079 --> 32:41.757
Well, anytime, just drop by.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.303
Yeah, I'll do that.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.716
I told you it wouldn't
take long, didn't I?

32:52.637 --> 32:56.141
Jack, I didn't like that.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.357
- Should've told me who you work for.
- Cyril didn't like it either.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.898
- So it's all girls together, is it?
- He's thinking that Sid and Gerald...

33:03.064 --> 33:06.113
won't like it when they hear
you've been sticking your nose in.

33:08.695 --> 33:13.246
He's right. Tell him to save
the money on the phone call.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.314
What do you want?

33:38.225 --> 33:42.196
- What happened to this car?
- What's it got to do with you?

33:42.395 --> 33:44.489
- This is my brother's car.
- Oh, yeah?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.943
- Yeah.
- Well, he drove it into the river.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.697
- Was the steering faulty?
- No.

33:51.905 --> 33:55.955
- What about the brakes?
- Fine. Nothing wrong with them.

33:56.159 --> 33:59.709
- How'd it happen, then?
- He was drunk.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.587
- Drunk as a lord.
- Was he?

34:02.749 --> 34:09.678
<i>I like New York in June,
how about you?</i>

34:10.422 --> 34:17.398
<i>I like a Gershwin tune,
how about you?</i>

34:17.556 --> 34:24.440
<i>I love a fireside
when a storm is due</i>

34:24.603 --> 34:29.860
<i>I like potato chips, moonlight,
motor trips, how about you?</i>

34:30.025 --> 34:32.404
- What can I get you, Jack?
- Large scotch.

34:35.864 --> 34:39.460
<i>Can't get my fill</i>

34:39.619 --> 34:45.592
<i>And Franklin Roosevelt's looks, yeah
They give me a thrill</i>

34:45.750 --> 34:47.797
<i>Holding hands in the movie show</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:50.384
Heard of a man called Thorpe?

34:51.840 --> 34:53.967
Old Thorpey.

34:54.175 --> 34:58.351
- I haven't seen him in a long time.
- That's what he was saying about you.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.741
He said he'd heard
you were up in town.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.164
Wondered if I knew where
you were staying.

35:16.364 --> 35:20.039
He wants to look you up.
Old times' sake.

35:20.702 --> 35:24.332
- That's nice. What did you tell him?
- Nowt.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.840
Good lad.

35:30.086 --> 35:36.970
<i>And I'm mad about good books
Can't get my fill</i>

35:37.135 --> 35:40.981
<i>And Frank Sinatra's looks</i>

35:41.139 --> 35:43.187
<i>They give me a thrill</i>

35:43.350 --> 35:45.227
<i>Holding hands in the movie show</i>

35:45.393 --> 35:49.273
<i>When all the lights are
low may not be new</i>

35:49.439 --> 35:50.656
See you later.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.862
- Where you off?
- Las Vegas. Come over.

35:55.028 --> 35:57.747
<i>I like it, how about?</i>

35:57.906 --> 36:03.629
<i>I like it, how about you?</i>

36:10.377 --> 36:14.348
Hold it, this is a peaceful town.
Now, everybody calm down.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.804
All right, play something, boys.
Go on, let's get.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.598
That's right, tear her
fucking hair out!

36:50.041 --> 36:52.715
- You all right now?
- Yeah.

36:52.919 --> 36:56.423
- Are you coming to South America?
- No.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.302
- Where are you gonna live, then?
- At my friend's house.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.684
- Oh, where's that?
- Wilton Estate.

37:04.639 --> 37:09.065
Nice family, are they?
Churchgoers and all that?

37:09.269 --> 37:11.738
Good, good.

37:11.896 --> 37:17.323
Well, I'm off tomorrow, so I don't
suppose I'll be seeing you again.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.029
Here.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.416
- Go and get your hair done.
- Oh, thanks.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.337
Be good.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.165
And don't trust boys.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.489
That was left for you this evening.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.362
What is it?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.652
My brother Frank.

37:58.860 --> 38:03.036
- Is he staying the night?
- Funny.

38:04.657 --> 38:08.628
- Can I phone London?
- It'll cost you.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.440
Hello?

38:33.353 --> 38:34.400
Oh, I miss you.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.866
I fancy you.

38:39.275 --> 38:42.700
I wish I was touching you now.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.407
Right now.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.372
Making love to you.

38:50.745 --> 38:57.469
I want to stroke you
and kiss you all over.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.970
- Where are you?
- I'm in the bedroom.

39:06.094 --> 39:07.141
My black underwear.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.225
The sexy silk ones?

39:16.646 --> 39:17.863
Take your bra off.

39:21.276 --> 39:25.702
- Stop it, darling.
- No, go on.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.338
Now...

39:39.335 --> 39:40.962
hold them.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.465
Gently.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.392
<i>Slowly.</i>

39:50.597 --> 39:52.895
<i>Imagine it's me.</i>

39:58.479 --> 40:04.657
When we're in South America,
we'll make love in the sun.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.826
All over.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.623
Make love again and again.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.504
You and me.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.467
What's the matter? You got
gut trouble or something?

40:27.675 --> 40:31.020
No, darling. Just
doing my exercises.

40:31.804 --> 40:36.651
Listen, Janet, um, Gerald's
just walked in. Must ring off.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.274
Yeah, I'll come tomorrow.

40:39.896 --> 40:42.069
Save it until Sunday.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.905
I'll be back then.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.588
That'll be for me.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.258
Thorpe. They were waiting
for us in the car park.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.844
- How many?
- Four of them.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.280
- Jack?
- Good evening.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.614
- I'd like a word with you, Jack.
- That's nice.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.622
- But confidential-like.
- You stay in the car.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.036
I'll come and listen.

41:41.082 --> 41:45.212
- What do you wanna tell me, Thorpey?
- I've been asked to give you this.

41:47.755 --> 41:51.055
Train goes four minutes past 12.
You've just got time.

41:52.552 --> 41:56.056
That's very kind of somebody.
Who do I have to thank?

41:59.434 --> 42:01.937
What happens if I miss the train?

42:02.103 --> 42:04.231
Well, I've been asked
to make sure you don't.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.816
Oh, really?

42:05.982 --> 42:09.111
You're getting very optimistic in
your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?

42:09.277 --> 42:11.120
Let's stop pissing about.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.947
Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.247
Right-o, lads.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.928
Don't worry. Don't worry about him.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.258
Oh, Christ.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.972
Thorpey!

42:46.397 --> 42:48.149
Hey!

44:50.396 --> 44:54.617
Hello, Keith. Stay there, Thorpey.

45:02.783 --> 45:05.332
- What the hell do you think you're at?
- I'm sorry.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.292
- You don't look it.
- No, really, I am.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.298
Don't pull that bloody
flannel with me.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.176
If you're a traveler, I'm bloody
Twiggy. And who's he?

45:12.376 --> 45:15.550
Are you still at it? Have
you no thought for others?

45:15.713 --> 45:18.683
- We're going inside.
- Why should I give a room to your sort?

45:18.841 --> 45:20.843
Up the stairs, Keith.
The door on the right.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.352
Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.
Everybody knew there'd be trouble...

45:24.513 --> 45:26.515
- when you moved in.
- Keep your trap shut.

45:26.682 --> 45:29.731
- I'll send the old man to see you.
- And wouldn't he love it?

45:29.894 --> 45:31.441
Where do you think you're going?

45:31.646 --> 45:33.740
Why don't you make us
all a nice cup of tea?

45:33.940 --> 45:35.988
What are you gonna do?

45:36.734 --> 45:40.955
Make us a cup of tea and I'll tell you.
I might even let you watch.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.580
- I'll call the police.
- No, you won't.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.126
Well, now, Thorpey.

45:49.330 --> 45:55.337
It seems that I've got
a secret benefactor.

45:55.544 --> 45:58.138
That's nice, isn't it, Keith?

45:58.839 --> 46:00.887
There's only one trouble.

46:02.677 --> 46:06.523
I don't know who to thank.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.354
Now...

46:14.563 --> 46:16.941
I wanna know who it is, Thorpe.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.913
All right, if you like, Thorpey,
we'll stop mucking about.

46:23.114 --> 46:26.584
Somebody doesn't want me
poking my nose into something.

46:26.784 --> 46:30.630
And I happen to know
what that something is.

46:30.830 --> 46:32.673
Now stand up.

46:36.085 --> 46:41.683
- Who paid you to see me off?
- Well, I can't, Jack, now, can I?

46:43.968 --> 46:47.438
- Yes, you can.
- Unh! Don't, Jack, don't!

46:47.763 --> 46:48.889
Who sent you?

46:50.308 --> 46:51.855
Brumby.

46:55.187 --> 46:57.030
There we are, you see?

46:57.231 --> 47:00.280
Now, you could tell me,
couldn't you?

47:00.735 --> 47:01.782
And quickly.

47:06.991 --> 47:10.416
Oh, Edna, come in.
Join the tea set.

47:10.619 --> 47:13.998
- Who's Brumby?
- Cliff Brumby.

47:14.206 --> 47:16.709
- Ever been to West Sea?
- Mm-hm.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.344
Ever been in an arcade there...

47:18.502 --> 47:20.925
- and put a penny in a slot machine?
- Yeah.

47:21.714 --> 47:25.093
Well, 10-to-1, it belongs
to Cliff Brumby.

47:26.427 --> 47:31.183
Like as not the bloody arcade
as well. Right along the coast.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.064
Isn't that right, Thorpey?

47:34.268 --> 47:37.272
- Where is he living these days?
- He's got a new place at Burnham.

47:37.480 --> 47:41.110
- Address?
- On the Denham Road. The Pantiles.

47:41.275 --> 47:43.744
Suppose you tell me what the
bloody hell is going on?

47:43.944 --> 47:45.696
- It's my house, you know.
- Yes, Edna.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.207
And I must say, I think
you've been great about it.

47:48.407 --> 47:52.037
- Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
- Can I go now?

47:52.203 --> 47:56.003
Oh, you must be joking. Keep him away
from a telephone. I'm going out for a bit.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.526
- Now just a minute.
- Shut up.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.885
Don't let him know I told
you, for God's sakes.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.268
- Jesus wept.
- Oh, Cliff, don't get mad.

48:53.472 --> 48:56.225
- I'll murder the little bitch.
- Cliff.

49:07.403 --> 49:10.373
- Daddy!
- That's right, blood Daddy.

49:11.031 --> 49:14.160
This is what you call having a few
friends over for a cup of coffee?

49:14.368 --> 49:17.212
Running right over
my bloody furniture.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.837
Spewing all over my
bloody goldfish.

49:26.589 --> 49:30.310
Go on, all of you. The whole
bloody lot of you, out.

49:34.221 --> 49:36.315
Don't run over the
bloody lawns either!

49:40.269 --> 49:41.896
Get out!

49:42.438 --> 49:43.906
Where are you, you little bitch?

49:44.106 --> 49:47.155
Sandra! Sandra.

49:47.318 --> 49:50.413
Well, old bastard, I hope
your house falls down.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.906
Open this door.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.377
- Good evening.
- Sandra!

49:57.578 --> 50:00.798
- Sandra, will you open this bloody door?
- Front door is open.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.342
- Who are you?
- I'm an old friend of Cliff's.

50:03.542 --> 50:06.591
I wanna see him. It's urgent.

50:06.795 --> 50:09.048
- What's it about?
- Business.

50:09.256 --> 50:13.853
- Well, I know all about Cliff's business.
- Yeah? Well, tell him the Fletchers sent me.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.068
- Cliff, Cliff.
- What the hell is up with you?

50:21.227 --> 50:23.400
- The Fletchers sent this man.
- What?

50:23.562 --> 50:26.190
I don't know who it is.
I've never seen him before.

50:27.942 --> 50:29.159
What the hell is all this?

50:29.318 --> 50:31.821
Do you know what the time is?
It's 2:00 in the morning.

50:31.987 --> 50:35.241
- I know.
- Well?

50:36.116 --> 50:37.493
Wife says the Fletchers sent you.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.879
What's so important it couldn't
wait until the morning?

50:41.247 --> 50:43.170
Listen, I'm in no mood for
playing silly buggers.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.675
I made a mistake.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.754
- What?
- I made a mistake.

50:47.962 --> 50:50.715
- What about?
- Never mind.

50:51.257 --> 50:52.804
It's not business?

50:52.967 --> 50:55.220
- See you.
- I don't like it when some tough nut...

50:55.386 --> 50:58.515
pushes his way in and out of my
house in the middle of the night.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.354
Bloody well tell me who sent you.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.981
You're a big man,
but you're in bad shape.

51:03.185 --> 51:05.984
With me it's a full-time job.
Now behave yourself.

51:06.188 --> 51:07.314
- Unh!
- All right.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.826
Good night, Mrs. Brumby.

51:48.981 --> 51:51.200
You sod.

51:58.657 --> 52:02.332
- They came back.
- No.

52:03.370 --> 52:05.998
Look at this, you bastard.

52:06.915 --> 52:12.263
- You don't care a stuff, do you?
- I'll buy you another one.

52:14.632 --> 52:18.512
What about the lad?
They took him away.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.770
- What will they do to him?
- Don't ask me.

52:24.683 --> 52:27.402
They bloody hurt me.

52:28.103 --> 52:29.776
You're lucky.

52:30.022 --> 52:32.116
They kill as well.

52:32.608 --> 52:36.829
What about you?
Did you kill Brumby?

52:37.321 --> 52:42.373
- Thorpey nearly died laughing.
- That old shit.

52:42.576 --> 52:44.453
What about Keith?

52:46.789 --> 52:47.836
What about Keith?

52:48.040 --> 52:50.134
- What are you gonna do?
- Pension him off.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.836
You're a bastard.

52:52.044 --> 52:53.887
What am I supposed to do?

52:54.088 --> 52:56.511
I don't know where they've
taken him. Do you?

52:58.258 --> 53:00.181
So shut up.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.519
What's that gun doing in your room?

53:06.517 --> 53:10.647
Suppose I phoned the police and told them
there's a bloke staying in my hotel...

53:10.854 --> 53:13.232
who's planning to shoot somebody.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.951
You wouldn't do that.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.743
And how do you know I wouldn't?

53:19.947 --> 53:22.291
Because I know you
wear purple underwear.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.954
What's that supposed to mean?

53:26.578 --> 53:28.376
Think about it.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.498
Are you awake?

54:12.791 --> 54:14.259
No.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.469
Do you want breakfast?

54:21.884 --> 54:24.012
You must be joking.

54:25.387 --> 54:27.890
I never eat breakfast.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.862
Did you sleep well?

54:35.022 --> 54:36.239
Uh-huh.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.835
Did you sleep well?

54:53.832 --> 54:55.334
Yeah.

54:57.044 --> 54:58.671
Yes, thank you.

55:20.275 --> 55:24.121
- Are you tired?
- No.

55:25.781 --> 55:28.250
- Are you tired?
- No.

55:30.202 --> 55:32.170
I'm not tired.

55:33.705 --> 55:35.548
Do you eat breakfast?

55:45.926 --> 55:48.020
Put us in it, Jack.

55:53.392 --> 55:54.894
Don't let us interrupt you.

55:56.854 --> 55:58.322
I might have guessed.

55:58.480 --> 56:01.609
Sorry about this, Jack, but,
you know, orders are orders.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.282
And what orders would they be, Con?

56:04.444 --> 56:08.369
Well, Gerald phoned us up
in the middle of the night.

56:08.574 --> 56:11.077
Said he heard you'd been
making a nuisance of yourself.

56:11.285 --> 56:13.629
We've gotta take you
back to London.

56:14.037 --> 56:16.256
Said we'd be doing him a big favor.

56:17.457 --> 56:20.927
Oh, we know why you're all steamed
up, and so do Gerald and Sid.

56:21.128 --> 56:23.551
But they, uh,
have to be diplomatic.

56:24.506 --> 56:25.553
Now...

56:27.759 --> 56:30.433
take me back to London.

56:33.599 --> 56:36.318
Come on, Jack. Don't you think
you ought to get dressed first?

56:38.061 --> 56:40.234
Come on, Jack, put it away.
You know you won't use it.

56:40.439 --> 56:41.736
Heh, uh, the gun, he means.

56:43.191 --> 56:46.035
Out. Out.

56:53.952 --> 56:55.044
Out.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.589
Heh, if Anna could see you now.

56:57.789 --> 56:59.132
Now, Jack, be reasonable.

56:59.333 --> 57:02.132
You know we're gonna take
you back sooner or later.

57:02.544 --> 57:04.012
Out.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.689
Mind you don't catch cold, Jack.

57:15.307 --> 57:18.311
I hope she's got
understanding neighbors.

57:22.773 --> 57:25.242
We'll see you when you've
got your drawers on.

58:07.359 --> 58:11.489
- Do me a favor, will you?
- What, and get myself beaten up again?

58:11.655 --> 58:13.828
- No chance of that.
- Not much.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.710
- They're friends of mine.
- And that'll make me feel better?

58:16.868 --> 58:20.088
Now, I don't want to
get rough, do I, eh?

58:20.247 --> 58:21.874
Take that.

58:25.377 --> 58:27.300
Out the back door.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.563
Hold it.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.027
Where do you think you're going?

58:42.894 --> 58:44.896
Strawberry Fair.

58:47.107 --> 58:48.609
In.

58:52.404 --> 58:53.747
Turn right.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.460
Open that door and go inside.

59:04.332 --> 59:05.504
What are you gonna do?

59:05.709 --> 59:07.757
Sit in the car and whistle
"Rule, Britannia."

59:07.961 --> 59:11.181
- You're coming back?
- How can I stay away?

59:45.457 --> 59:48.131
- Where were you, then?
- Oh.

59:48.543 --> 59:49.590
Bollocks.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.415
Keith in?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:28.880
Keith!

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.604
What happened to you, then?

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.111
How did you find me?

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.409
Did they give you a rough time?

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:56.786
No.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.617
You bastard. You knew
they'd come back.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.622
No, I didn't.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:07.623
Does Albert Swift still
live across the ferry?

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.926
- Get knotted.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:15.385
- I wanna square things with you first.
- Oh, yeah? How?

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:16.972
Stuff it.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.677
My girlfriend's coming
from Liverpool tonight.

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.229
Nice surprise, isn't it?

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:27.981
I'm sorry. Here. Get
yourself a course in karate.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.650
Frank said you were a shit and
he was bloody well right!

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.156
You even screwed
his wife, didn't you?

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:41.119
The poor bastard didn't even
know if the kid was his!

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:04.063
- How were things between you and Frank?
- He was all right to me.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:11.608
- Nothing more? Just another fellow?
- Nicer than most.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.406
- But he was just another fellow, though?
- Yeah.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:19.237
- Even though he was nicer than most?
- Yes.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.538
I can't help the way I am.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:25.288
- Why did you see him so regular?
- Heh. Once a week?

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.335
I'd call that regular.

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.459
He was gentlemanly. I like that.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.712
Once a week, you like
a gentleman, do you?

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:36.887
Look, I'm me, right?
We are what we are, like it or not.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:43.261
- Why all the bloody needle?
- What was bugging Frank?

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.812
He wanted me to leave
Dave and marry him.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:48.019
But last Friday I told
him it wouldn't work.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:49.728
Dave would've killed us both.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.857
He followed me home and kicked
up a stink in the street.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:55.280
I had to tell Frank
I couldn't see him anymore.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.950
It was getting too dodgy.
That was Sunday.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.448
He said he'd kill himself.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:04.577
I was frightened what he might do.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.754
I don't believe you.
Frank wasn't like that.

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:15.584
- I'm the villain in the family, remember?
- It's the truth.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.923
It is, honestly.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.634
You bloody whore.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:27.016
Frank was too careful
to die like that.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.474
- Now, who killed him?
- I don't know nothing!

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:36.610
Now listen, the only reason
I came back to this crap house...

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:41.819
was to find out who did it,
and I'm not leaving till I do.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.696
Do you understand?

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.205
Eh?

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.459
Hello, Jack.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.633
You bitch.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.382
It was you who told them
I was here, wasn't it?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.137
- Eh?
- Aah!

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:12.433
Peter is very upset about his car.
He's gonna shit all over you.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.938
I'll catch up with you, Margaret!

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.065
- You bastard!
- Come on, get me!

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:03.525
Over here, Jack!

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.162
Peter, Peter!

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.748
Wait, now, hold up.
What are you doing?

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:27.048
You didn't know you had a
fairy godmother, did you?

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.134
No, frankly I didn't know that.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.016
A fairy godmother all of your own.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.814
- Aren't you lucky?
- Yeah.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.812
So where are we going, princess?

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:41.943
- To the Demon King's castle, of course.
- Of course, where else?

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:03.211
- How did you know where I'd be?
- You were seen parking your car.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:08.678
The Demon King waived his wand and
I was dispatched to bring you to him.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:12.512
- Lucky for you I waited.
- Very lucky, I should think.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.815
- You're drunk.
- Nasty. Whee!

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:20.193
- He must've been pretty sure I'd come.
- Oh, he was.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.480
He told me a magic spell
that would make you come.

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:26.316
- And what was that?
- We're there now.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:29.114
Thank God.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.299
A new venture of mine.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.965
It's gonna be a restaurant.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:48.301
Do you like it?

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.725
Yes, very nice.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:54.803
Last night after you'd gone...

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:59.733
I did a little bit of asking around,
seeing as you weren't very forthcoming.

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:04.772
It seems you're concerned about
the death of your brother.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.778
I got to thinking how
nice it would be...

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:12.579
if the bloke you were after was the
same bloke I wanted off my back.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:18.414
You know my life.
Machines. The arcades.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:21.747
It's a nice business.
It runs itself.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:26.381
People put money in, I take it out.
There's not much rough stuff.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.554
It's a business that
makes me very happy.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.725
Recently, though, I've
had a spot of bother.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.098
One of my lads gets a
little over-anxious...

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:39.146
and flogs some machines to a
club that's already got some.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:41.395
The upshot is I've
got to eat shit...

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:44.102
and start plugging my
machines to other clubs.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.938
As far as I'm concerned, that's it.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.323
Apparently not.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.493
These people I've
offended get the idea...

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:56.244
that it would be a good thing to
take over the whole of my outfit.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:58.579
So I'm worried.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.995
I can't fight them. I don't
have that sort of a setup.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:05.085
But I've gotta fix them
before they fix me.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:11.756
The trouble is, if I try and
they find out, I'm dead.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:22.350
Five grand, that belongs to you...

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.356
along with a little name
I'm gonna give you.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.566
- What name?
- Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:33.283
Kinnear did it.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.078
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.749
All I know is people were shitting
bricks up at his place last Saturday.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:44.671
Your brother's name was mentioned.
Next day he was dead.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.341
- Why?
- I don't know. That's all I was told.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.843
- That's not good enough.
- Christ! What...?

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.341
Do me a favor.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:58.553
Do you really think I'm gonna
fix Kinnear on your say-so?

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.684
Just because he put me
on to you last night.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.937
Don't think you can
play the same trick.

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:09.395
- Stroll on.
- Jack, you're wrong.

01:09:09.604 --> 01:09:13.654
- Good afternoon, Mr. Brumby.
- Jack!

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.338
Who's setting you up in this place?

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.762
Brumby.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.970
- Is he coming here?
- Don't worry.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:08.523
He's meeting the architects
at the restaurant.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.410
- Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
- He won't.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.362
He thinks I'm simple.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.925
What does he want a great
big country place for?

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:43.508
- Entertaining.
- What kind of entertaining?

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:48.972
Now you're asking.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:12:02.073
- Does Brumby really enjoy that crap?
- Especially when I play the lead.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:22.677
Did Kinnear say
anything about me...

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.258
after I left the other night?

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:32.183
- That's why you waited for me.
- No, not entirely.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:38.355
- You're sure about that?
- Sure, I'm sure.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.862
You bastard.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:29.677
- Glenda?
- I'm in the bath.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.507
- I want to give you an Oscar.
- Ha!

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.601
You've been watching the film.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:46.145
- Tell me about the girl.
- What girl?

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.313
The young girl.

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:53.909
- Who pulled her?
- I don't know.

01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:59.407
- Was it Albert?
- I shouldn't think so.

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:03.669
- Is it one of Kinnear's films?
- Yeah.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.956
Who set it up?

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:10.384
- Eric?
- Heh, yeah.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:17.092
- Then he must have pulled her.
- I expect so.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.062
Did my brother, Frank...

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:31.239
- find out?
- Your brother? What are you talking about?

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.944
You lying bitch!

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:49.958
Now tell me the truth.

01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:54.170
The girl's name was Doreen.
That's all I know.

01:17:54.378 --> 01:17:57.222
- And you didn't know her last name?
- No.

01:17:57.923 --> 01:18:02.303
Well, it's Carter. That's my name.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:10.237
And her father was my brother and
he was murdered last Sunday.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:16.368
Now get in there and get dressed.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:27.461
Get in. Get in!

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.099
Where's Albert?

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:51.101
Where's Albert?

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:56.232
I know where to find him.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:07.585
Eric? He's come for Albert.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:12.131
<i>I don't know.
On the ferry, I reckon.</i>

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:17.591
<i>Number two, 10-to-1 now.</i>

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.006
<i>The daily double...</i>

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.719
<i>3 pounds, 13 shillings.</i>

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:30.687
<i>That's the double,
3 pounds, 13 shillings.</i>

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:32.768
<i>And the last race at 5-to-1...</i>

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.562
Hello, Albert.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:40.158
Hello, Jack.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.075
I don't know anything, Jack.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:46.912
Yes, you do.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.041
Talk or I'll kill you.

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.381
I know, I know.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.421
- Do you wanna go to the toilet, Albert?
- Huh?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.974
Do you want to go
to the toilet, huh?

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:06.472
Do you wanna go to the toilet?

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:33.087
- You can't get away from me, Albert.
- I know, I know.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:38.379
For chrissake, give us a fag.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.758
I didn't know who Doreen was.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.896
I thought she was
just another bird.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.474
Did Eric Paice pull her?

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:56.769
- Yeah.
- How?

01:20:59.229 --> 01:21:03.985
I don't know. He's got his ways.
He knows Margaret.

01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:09.949
- When did you find out?
- A couple of weeks back.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:12.660
- How?
- No choice.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:16.498
- Had a visit from somebody.
- Who?

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.291
Cliff Brumby.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:22.049
He'd seen the film.
He wanted to meet Doreen.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:28.308
- And you told Brumby.
- Yeah.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.303
Who killed Frank?

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.062
Do you wanna be dead, Albert?

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:45.530
Last Sunday afternoon Eric and two
of his boys arrived with Frank.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.077
They told me he'd rumbled.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:50.581
Somehow he'd seen the film and was
about to shoot his mouth off.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:54.745
They asked me for some whiskey and
started forcing it down his throat.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:58.171
I thought they'd just duff
him up a bit. Honest.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:02.710
What did you do, Albert?

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:05.758
Nothing.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.640
What could I do?

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:15.481
Did Eric know that
Frank was my brother?

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:18.355
Yes, yes, I told him.

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:23.322
- What did he say?
- "Good."

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:31.993
They drove Frank away in a car.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:39.963
- Is that all there is?
- Yeah.

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:44.293
That's it, then.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.886
Jack, for chrissake. For chrissake.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.765
You knew what I'd do,
didn't you, Albert?

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:58.475
Listen, Christ,
I didn't kill him, Jack.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.271
- I know you didn't kill him! I know!
- Aah!

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:22.919
<i>She is away fourth and last.</i>

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:28.262
<i>Back in the stands,
the circuit race.</i>

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:32.717
<i>Siren's in the lead.
Siren's six and...</i>

01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:38.139
Put my two bob on Lucky Leap,
please, would you?

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:16.513
I saw you.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:40.617
Don't shoot, you stupid bastards!
Kinnear said no shooting!

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:43.449
- You're getting us all nicked!
- Get stuffed!

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:46.035
Now turn in it, Peter.
Gerald wants see him first.

01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:47.916
Shut up!

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:01.642
Are you coming in or are you
gonna piss about all day?

01:27:01.842 --> 01:27:04.436
You're bloody finished,
you know that, Jack?

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:08.436
- I've bloody finished you.
- Not till I'm dead, Eric.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.610
Oh, you've still got
your sense of humor.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:15.155
Do you wanna tell him how
I've finished him, Con?

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.067
He's told Gerald
about you and Anna.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:24.202
He didn't believe me at first.
Then Peter talked to him.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:27.080
Didn't even say goodbye.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:31.084
He just asked us to take
you back, ha, ha. Alive.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.624
He's probably talking
to her right now.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:37.462
Are you still gonna fancy her when
Gerald's finished with her face and that?

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:58.570
Stay where you are, Peter.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:03.612
Don't! Don't!

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:14.919
Carter, your car needs a wash!

01:28:45.612 --> 01:28:49.037
I don't want them cooking in here.
They could put a hatch in that wall.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:52.290
Yes, well, I can do that,
but it's all a question of design.

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:56.419
- Yes, aesthetically you've got to use the...
- Who in Christ's name is that?

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:02.296
The bloody madman.

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:06.884
Extraordinary fellow.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:24.906
Jack.

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.074
- You shouldn't have shown Frank the film.
- I had to.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.868
- It was the only way to get at them.
- You shouldn't have.

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:37.084
- Your brother was going to the police. Unh!
- You shit. You didn't have the guts...

01:29:37.247 --> 01:29:39.750
- to do it yourself, did you?
- They'd have killed me.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:41.668
- They killed my brother instead.
- Aah!

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:44.304
I didn't think they'd do it.

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:47.724
How would you have liked it...

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:51.224
if that had been your daughter
being poked in that film?

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:52.763
- Eh?
- Unh!

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.103
What would you have done then?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:04.733
Slags likes your Sandra
can get away with it.

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:06.488
Can't they?

01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.998
The Doreens of this
world can't. Can they?

01:30:33.011 --> 01:30:35.605
There's someone in the car!

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:57.544
It's very rude to disappear like that.
Where can he possibly be?

01:31:14.719 --> 01:31:19.020
I have an awful feeling we're not
going to get our fees on this job.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:28.700
The guy on the swing bridge. Mm-hm.

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:31.152
Okay.

01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:34.410
- How did it happen?
- I don't know how it happened.

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.242
How far did he fall?

01:31:37.450 --> 01:31:41.125
What did he say? Um, 19
floors I think it was.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.548
- Really? Was he dead?
- Oh, yes.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:45.591
Apparently he hit his
head on the pavement.

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.551
He would be, then,
wouldn't he, dear?

01:31:47.711 --> 01:31:48.758
I'm sure.

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:52.182
Oh, well, it's best to
go quick like that.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:42.311
Number nine, Doctor's Orders.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:48.397
Five and eight, 58.
One and five, 15.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:54.157
Two and six, 26.
Three-oh, blind 30.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:00.493
Seven and eight, 78.
Five and three, 53.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.419
Nine-oh, blind 90.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.294
Two and five, on 25.

01:33:09.959 --> 01:33:13.338
One so far on 25.

01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:15.924
Anybody else, please,
for that ball bounce?

01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:19.052
Just the one? Nobody else?

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.309
Checking just one this time.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.979
- Oh, it's cold.
- Oh, it is.

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.957
- I've come for you, Margaret.
- Aah!

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:58.777
Who? What?

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:40.155
Hello. Gerald?

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.658
It's Carter.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:47.246
Now listen carefully,
you hairy-faced git.

01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:54.174
I've got the film and enough evidence
to put you away for a long time.

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:58.924
All it takes is one
call to the police.

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:02.136
Really?

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:04.096
So?

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:08.139
I'll do a simple deal with you.

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:10.769
All I want...

01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:18.572
I see.

01:36:19.023 --> 01:36:21.526
I think that can be arranged.

01:36:21.734 --> 01:36:28.208
But I don't want him there
until 6:00 in the morning.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:30.706
Okay?

01:36:32.662 --> 01:36:34.164
Right.

01:36:34.872 --> 01:36:36.590
Out.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:45.308
You want something, Cyril?

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.308
Yes, Eric. A word with you.

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:06.321
Get out.

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:16.172
Come on. Come on.

01:37:22.045 --> 01:37:27.267
Take your clothes off.
Take your clothes off.

01:37:58.247 --> 01:37:59.874
Keep your pants on.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:03.591
Lie down. Lie down.

01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:11.863
I want you to listen
very carefully.

01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:15.371
- Jack Carter.
- Yes.

01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:17.956
Do you know what he looks like?

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:20.713
Mm-hm, yeah.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:31.591
Hmm.

01:39:33.176 --> 01:39:34.678
Yeah.

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:48.467
<i>Police.</i>

01:44:50.201 --> 01:44:52.704
You couldn't win an
egg-and-spoon race, Eric.

01:44:52.912 --> 01:44:54.129
Sod off.

01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:58.756
Stay away from the car
or I'll blow you apart.

01:47:21.894 --> 01:47:25.774
Stand up. Stand up.

01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:38.544
I'll bet you could use a drink.

01:47:39.328 --> 01:47:42.377
Couldn't you, Eric, eh?

01:47:42.539 --> 01:47:44.041
Have a drink.

01:47:44.249 --> 01:47:48.379
- You've still got your sense of humor.
- Drink up.

01:47:49.588 --> 01:47:51.636
Drink up. Drink up.

01:47:54.718 --> 01:47:59.349
I want you to drink all of that.

01:47:59.556 --> 01:48:03.231
Do you understand? Drink it all.

01:48:04.103 --> 01:48:08.108
Just like it was with
my brother Frank.

01:48:08.857 --> 01:48:10.609
Go on.

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:13.078
Drink up.

01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:17.787
Drink up, Eric.

01:48:19.827 --> 01:48:22.626
It was you.

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:25.959
It was you who poured
it down him, wasn't it?

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:30.216
Eh, Eric? What? What? Eh?

01:48:32.923 --> 01:48:35.472
Did you all have a good laugh, eh?

01:48:35.676 --> 01:48:38.600
Did you have a good laugh when
he was spewing it up, eh?

01:48:42.141 --> 01:48:46.271
Drink up. Drink it. Drink it!

01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:53.696
Did you pass the bottle around when
the car went over the top? Eh?

01:48:54.653 --> 01:48:56.747
Goodbye, Eric!
