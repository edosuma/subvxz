00:03.770 --> 00:05.670
Guys, I have exciting news!

00:05.671 --> 00:07.439
Guess who's coming to Z-Tech to visit?

00:07.440 --> 00:10.259
[Gasping] Ooh, is it
philatelist Daniel Monteiro,

00:10.260 --> 00:15.303
owner of the world's largest
collection of stamps depicting birds?

00:15.304 --> 00:18.156
Please say yes, please say yes.

00:18.157 --> 00:22.979
Or maybe it's Spanish
cubist painter Pablo Picasso!

00:22.980 --> 00:25.428
Fletcher, Picasso died.

00:25.429 --> 00:27.589
In 1973.

00:28.185 --> 00:31.365
So he won't say much.

00:31.703 --> 00:35.638
Fletcher, it's obviously
not some dead artist.

00:35.639 --> 00:38.459
Is it Spider-Man?

00:38.827 --> 00:42.388
Uh, no, it's someone
way better than that!

00:42.389 --> 00:48.289
Imagine the best person you can possibly
imagine and then multiply it by a billion.

00:52.142 --> 00:54.244
It's my brother, Cameron!

00:54.245 --> 00:56.045
- Oh!
- Bummer.

00:56.046 --> 00:57.966
Lame.

00:59.366 --> 01:03.578

Maybe I built it up too much.

01:58.435 --> 02:00.335
Cameron, I've missed you!

02:00.336 --> 02:03.030
I've missed you, too.
Mom and dad say "hi".

02:03.031 --> 02:07.171
They also sent your favorite lasagna.

02:09.679 --> 02:11.546
This dish is empty.

02:11.547 --> 02:15.551
Because it's also my favorite lasagna.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.687
Anyway, I've got some exciting news.

02:18.688 --> 02:20.209
I'm applying to college!

02:20.210 --> 02:21.283
Really?

02:21.284 --> 02:25.161
As a student or for
like a maintenance job?

02:25.162 --> 02:29.165
Because frankly, I don't think
you're qualified for either.

02:29.166 --> 02:32.101
The point is, I'm hoping
to get into film school!

02:32.102 --> 02:34.880
But for my application,
I have to make a movie.

02:34.881 --> 02:37.783
Well, if there's anything I
can do to help, let me know.

02:37.784 --> 02:40.632
Well, there is one thing.

02:40.633 --> 02:44.338
My movie takes place in
a boarding school. And...

02:44.339 --> 02:48.217
You happen to go to boarding school...

02:48.218 --> 02:51.186
You want to shoot the movie here?

02:51.187 --> 02:54.256
Oh, so that's why you came to visit.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.016
Of course not!

02:56.017 --> 02:59.161
I also need you to be in it.

02:59.162 --> 03:04.032
Plus I heard a rumor that
Spider-Man was coming!

03:04.033 --> 03:05.400
Can I be in it, too?

03:05.401 --> 03:07.945
Since I can learn my lines
instantly, I'll have more time

03:07.946 --> 03:12.072
to lounge in my dressing room
and demand coconut shavings!

03:12.073 --> 03:13.353
You hate coconut shavings.

03:13.354 --> 03:16.176
Yes, but I love demanding things.

03:16.177 --> 03:19.112
So can I film here? Please?

03:19.113 --> 03:23.317
This is my one chance to prove to
everyone that I also have a talent.

03:23.318 --> 03:28.321
You mean other than consuming a 12
pound lasagna on a 40 minute bus ride?

03:28.322 --> 03:29.648
[Laughing]

03:29.649 --> 03:33.393
Absolutely, Cameron. I'll ask Mr.
Grundy, but it won't be a problem.

03:33.394 --> 03:35.228
He and I are super close.

03:35.229 --> 03:38.431
He even gave me this
friendship necklace.

03:38.432 --> 03:42.135
Chyna, that's a student badge.

03:42.136 --> 03:43.203
Everyone got one of those.

03:43.204 --> 03:47.404
Well, mine came with friendship, okay?

03:55.282 --> 03:57.183
Oh, no!

03:57.184 --> 03:59.418
It's the egg dentist!

03:59.419 --> 04:03.439
And he's got his evil bone banjo!

04:03.572 --> 04:05.852

04:08.686 --> 04:13.199
Angus, Angus, wake up! It's
me, Fletcher, from school.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.235
Sorry. I was having a nightmare.

04:15.236 --> 04:18.103
This the fifth time you've
woken me up this week.

04:18.105 --> 04:20.505
Why do you keep having
the same bad dream?

04:20.505 --> 04:21.937
I don't know,

04:21.938 --> 04:26.246
but it doesn't help that you're the
last thing I see before going to bed.

04:26.247 --> 04:28.994
Well, I cannot function like this!

04:28.995 --> 04:32.967
I get very cranky if I don't get
at least eight hours a night...

04:32.968 --> 04:36.208
Of dreaming about Chyna!

04:37.090 --> 04:42.990
Isn't there something I can
do to get you to sleep quietly?

04:45.640 --> 04:50.800
I don't know if you're
asleep, but my legs are.

04:52.372 --> 04:54.106
Mr. Grundy!

04:54.107 --> 04:57.109
I was wondering if my brother, Cameron,
could shoot a movie here this week.

04:57.110 --> 04:58.558
Great! Thanks so much!

04:58.559 --> 05:01.292
Nope. Never. Absolutely not.

05:01.293 --> 05:02.768
What? Why not?

05:02.769 --> 05:04.654
Chyna, this is a place of business.

05:04.655 --> 05:09.846
I can't have it cluttered with
cameras and wires and "actors".

05:09.847 --> 05:13.012
Plus, we shot something here
once and it did not turn out well.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.394
What was it?

05:14.395 --> 05:17.237
My online dating video profile.

05:17.238 --> 05:19.828
Mr. Grundy he has to
shoot at a boarding school.

05:19.829 --> 05:23.063
- And I promise nothing will happen...
- Am I not speaking english?

05:23.064 --> 05:25.037
No really, am I not?

05:25.038 --> 05:27.495
Because when I'm upset,
sometimes I speak in gibberish.

05:27.496 --> 05:33.396
Either way, there will be absolutely no
filming here at... [speaking gibberish]

05:35.282 --> 05:37.061
Cameron had his heart set on this.

05:37.062 --> 05:42.962
I mean, he even made up a T-shirt that
says "see, mom and dad? I'm not a nobody!"

05:43.189 --> 05:45.324
What are you going to do?

05:45.325 --> 05:47.226
What choice do I have?

05:47.227 --> 05:49.442
There's only one thing I can do.

05:49.443 --> 05:53.299
Great news, Cameron! Mr. Grundy
said you could shoot here!

05:53.300 --> 05:56.721
Really? You're the best
sister I could ever have.

05:56.722 --> 06:01.559
Except Steven Spielberg's sister,
because then I'd be Steven Spielberg.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.560
I'll be right back!

06:05.279 --> 06:08.952
Chyna, why would you tell him that?

06:08.953 --> 06:11.232
Mr. Grundy very specifically said...

06:11.233 --> 06:15.707
"Absolutely no filming here
at... [speaking gibberish]"

06:15.708 --> 06:21.026
I wanted to tell Cameron the truth but
[Sighing] I couldn't break his heart.

06:21.027 --> 06:25.658
So we'll just have to make
sure Mr. Grundy never finds out.

06:25.659 --> 06:27.464
We'll shoot the movie on the sly.

06:27.465 --> 06:30.285
He'll never know.

06:38.111 --> 06:40.438
I'm going to need some help
with the rest of my equipment.

06:40.439 --> 06:42.448
The rest?

06:42.449 --> 06:46.051
Dad knew a guy who owns a
warehouse full of this stuff.

06:46.052 --> 06:51.224
Look, they even threw in
these spotlights for free!

06:51.225 --> 06:56.296
Hey, look! It's the Hollywood premiere
of "you're going to get in trouble!"

06:56.297 --> 06:58.164
I wonder how this ends.

friend a little spoiler alert?

07:11.936 --> 07:15.188
Cameron, I don't think
you need all these lights.

07:15.189 --> 07:16.913
I mean, you're making a horror movie.

07:16.914 --> 07:19.259
What's scarier than the dark?

07:19.260 --> 07:21.798
Ghosts, Vampires, witches,
zombies, leprechauns,

07:21.799 --> 07:25.499
giraffes, double decker
buses, and curly fries.

07:26.534 --> 07:29.935
Hey, what is that doing there?

07:29.936 --> 07:32.239
I could have broken my neck!

07:32.240 --> 07:35.060
Or worse, a heel!

07:35.892 --> 07:37.688
Sorry, that's Cameron's.

07:37.689 --> 07:39.115
He's here visiting.

07:39.116 --> 07:40.792
Who is Cameron?

07:40.793 --> 07:42.580
Chyna's brother.

07:42.581 --> 07:45.586
You went to school with
him for like 10 years.

07:45.587 --> 07:48.255
How can you not remember me?

07:48.256 --> 07:50.673
One time you had me
dress up as an old man

07:50.674 --> 07:54.227
to help you trick a
beauty pageant official.

07:54.228 --> 07:58.198
His eyelashes got eaten off
by snails in your beauty club.

07:58.199 --> 08:02.336
You hired a marching band so
he would friend you online.

08:02.337 --> 08:08.237
Look, I can't be expected to remember
every little person I run into.

08:08.342 --> 08:10.310

Well, you do have the right
look for the leading role.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.999
But I need someone
who can really scream.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.894
[Laughing] I can do that!
But I'm a method actress.

08:28.895 --> 08:34.202
So to scream, I just need to think
of the most terrifying thing I can.

Nope, because I'm too
afraid to go to sleep.

08:55.557 --> 08:57.425
Don't worry.

08:57.426 --> 09:01.562
I've rigged a simple system
to wake me up if I doze off.

09:01.563 --> 09:03.131

09:03.132 --> 09:04.959

Why'd you put it over me?

09:33.295 --> 09:37.855
So you'd scream and it would wake me up.

09:42.171 --> 09:45.081
Okay, you three are
boarding school friends

09:45.082 --> 09:47.876
who stay at the deserted
campus over spring break.

09:47.877 --> 09:52.314
In this scene, you're looking for clues
about the ghost that's haunting the school.

09:52.315 --> 09:56.635
So, what is my character's back story?

09:57.319 --> 09:59.421
You play Donna, the rebel.

09:59.422 --> 10:02.449

you, "don't open that door"!

10:02.450 --> 10:07.462
You do it anyway, leading to
your gory and immediate death.

Well, I had it coming.

10:09.599 --> 10:12.899
I'll go get the camera.

Okay, since I got Cameron to
get rid of those big lights,

we can do this thing without
drawing any attention to ourselves.

really help this scene?

giant close-up of my face.

[Gasping]

10:37.428 --> 10:38.528
No.

10:38.529 --> 10:44.079
You should shoot the whole movie just using
tiny, hard-to-spot cell phone cameras.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.370
It would be very cutting edge.

10:46.371 --> 10:48.505
I like it.

10:48.506 --> 10:52.409
Especially since I have no
idea how to operate this camera.

10:52.410 --> 10:55.679
I was basically using it as a scooter.

Make sure you get my good side.

this scene as quickly as possible.

- Oh, are you looking for me?

around in the dark with flashlights?

11:17.201 --> 11:20.796
Um, we're just trying
to conserve energy.

11:20.797 --> 11:24.770

its own power using a combination of...

didn't tell you this before but...

11:48.995 --> 11:50.600
The truth is...

11:50.601 --> 11:55.471
The building is haunted! There's
a ghost trying to steal our souls!

11:55.472 --> 11:58.323
I knew it! I never should
have built this school on

11:58.324 --> 12:01.906
the grounds of an old,
abandoned, haunted Morgue!

12:01.907 --> 12:04.546
Why would you do that?

12:04.547 --> 12:06.615
It was a great bargain.

12:06.616 --> 12:11.896

12:25.891 --> 12:28.371
You're either pregnant or homesick.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.892
I'm pregnant?

12:31.242 --> 12:34.544
No, you're not pregnant! You are a boy!

12:34.545 --> 12:38.805
Excuse me, I'm not a biology prodigy!

12:40.721 --> 12:43.848
But now that you mention it...

12:43.849 --> 12:46.076
I have been kind of homesick.

12:46.077 --> 12:48.825
All we have to do is make
this room feel as safe

12:48.826 --> 12:53.396
and as comfortable as yours back
home, then good-bye nightmares!

12:53.397 --> 12:55.598
- You think so?
- Trust me.

12:55.599 --> 12:57.742
If there is one thing
Fletcher Quimby is good at,

12:57.743 --> 13:02.984
it's pretending to be good at
things I've just learned about.

13:02.985 --> 13:05.224
I can't believe this place is haunted!

13:05.225 --> 13:11.125
The only thing scarier than ghosts
are giraffes and curly fries!

13:11.282 --> 13:13.449
Well, you better leave!

13:13.450 --> 13:15.285
Because do you hear that?

13:15.286 --> 13:17.420
It's the sound of giraffes screaming.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.588
- Giraffes don't make any noise.
- Exactly!

13:19.589 --> 13:21.929
[Whimpering]

13:23.526 --> 13:27.222
Was that Mr. Grundy? I
want to go talk to him.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.067
What? No.

13:29.068 --> 13:32.095
That was the janitor.

13:32.096 --> 13:35.122
He seemed pretty well
dressed to be a janitor.

13:35.123 --> 13:39.474
He must be on his way to the
janitor awards, the Sweepies!

13:39.475 --> 13:43.267
Yeah, I bet he cleans up there.

13:43.268 --> 13:45.414
Well, I want him in my movie!

13:45.415 --> 13:46.953
The fear in his eyes!

13:46.954 --> 13:48.787
The terror in his screams!

13:48.788 --> 13:51.419
The hope that he'll work for free!

13:51.420 --> 13:53.222
I'm going to go talk to him.

13:53.223 --> 13:56.523
No! Let me talk to him.

13:56.559 --> 13:58.260
I don't care how long it takes.

13:58.261 --> 14:02.197
I will not take no for an answer.

14:02.198 --> 14:03.265
[Elevator dinging]

14:03.266 --> 14:06.031
Sorry, Cameron, but he said no.

14:06.032 --> 14:08.269
It was like talking to a wall.

14:08.270 --> 14:11.338
Or a pair of elevator doors.

14:11.339 --> 14:14.909
I'm starting to think you don't
want my movie to be good, do you?

14:14.910 --> 14:18.246
You're jealous that you're not the
only one in the family with talent.

14:18.247 --> 14:20.348
What? No. That's ridiculous.

14:20.349 --> 14:24.252
Yeah, Chyna doesn't have any talent.

14:24.253 --> 14:26.083
Then get me that janitor.

14:26.084 --> 14:27.816
You promised to help me.

14:27.817 --> 14:29.798
Okay, okay.

14:29.799 --> 14:31.882
I'll try again.

14:31.883 --> 14:34.643
[Elevator dinging]

14:35.853 --> 14:36.886
[Elevator dinging]

14:36.887 --> 14:40.252
It took a lot of convincing.

14:40.253 --> 14:43.024
But he changed his mind. He'll do it.

14:43.025 --> 14:47.765
Awesome! I'll go write
him into the script!

14:47.984 --> 14:49.698
Now what are you going to do?

14:49.699 --> 14:53.147
I'm just going to have to somehow
trick Mr. Grundy into being a janitor

14:53.148 --> 14:56.150
so he can be in the movie, without
letting him know he's in the movie.

14:56.151 --> 14:59.222
And keep Cameron from finding
out who Mr. Grundy really is.

14:59.223 --> 15:05.123
Ooh! This "you're going to get in trouble"
movie has reached an exciting cliffhanger!

15:12.076 --> 15:14.116
[Music]

15:15.240 --> 15:17.749
- Grundy: There's no such thing as ghosts.
- Mr. Grundy?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.211
There's no such thing as ghosts.

15:20.212 --> 15:24.112
There's no such thing as ghosts.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.269
Mr. Grundy, it's just me.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.835
Come on.

15:29.836 --> 15:33.357
Look, we cannot let this
ghost force us into hiding.

15:33.358 --> 15:35.225
We have to fight back.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.992
I'm not much of a fighter.

15:36.993 --> 15:41.313
I'm more of a lover. Of running away.

15:41.466 --> 15:44.301
Look, you will be perfectly safe.

15:44.302 --> 15:48.442
All you have to do is put this on.

15:49.508 --> 15:51.670
Janitor coveralls?

15:51.671 --> 15:54.011
What? No...

15:54.041 --> 15:57.381
Those are ghost buster coveralls.

15:57.382 --> 15:59.550
I'm not very good at busting.

15:59.551 --> 16:01.963
Trust me. Busting makes you feel good.

16:01.964 --> 16:05.623
I don't know. Maybe
we should call someone.

16:05.624 --> 16:08.564
Who you gonna call?

16:11.196 --> 16:15.099
Okay, so I've put phones all over
the Ant Farm to film the action.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.281
You watch it here, out of sight.

16:18.282 --> 16:22.540
So the janitor won't be intimidated
by working with a big-time Director.

16:22.541 --> 16:25.343
A big-time Director is
taking over my movie?

16:25.344 --> 16:26.549
Yes.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.415
Steven Spielberg is taking
over a movie that you wrote

16:29.416 --> 16:33.037
in an hour and are
shooting on cell phones.

16:33.038 --> 16:35.887
So what's the janitor's line?

16:35.888 --> 16:38.223
It's the most important
line in the movie.

16:38.224 --> 16:43.195
He needs to say "it's happening
again! We're all going to die!"

16:43.196 --> 16:45.330
You know what would be even better?

16:45.331 --> 16:48.166
If he said "hi, Chyna?"

16:48.167 --> 16:53.171
I mean, think about how good
that'll sound in the trailer.

16:53.172 --> 16:54.613
Okay, I got it.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.658
"It's happening again!
We're all going to die!"

16:57.659 --> 17:00.596
Wow, I am a good screenwriter.

17:00.597 --> 17:06.497
If only they had something like
the Sweepy Awards for movies.

17:08.553 --> 17:11.088
[Elevator dings]

17:11.089 --> 17:13.924
Ah! I did some research
and you're right.

17:13.925 --> 17:17.393
Cleaning out negative energy is
the best way to get rid of ghosts.

17:17.394 --> 17:19.609
[Laughing] Of course it is.

17:19.611 --> 17:21.414
You think I would make
that up to get you in

17:21.415 --> 17:26.335
some silly costume to
pretend to be a janitor?

17:26.502 --> 17:28.859
[In ghostly voice] Get out.

17:28.860 --> 17:31.106
What was that?

17:31.107 --> 17:33.818
- It must have been the ghost!
- [Trembling]

17:33.819 --> 17:36.789
- The ghost is in this room!
- [Trembling]

17:36.790 --> 17:39.790
Sweet buttered beans!

17:41.385 --> 17:44.120
Oh no! Is it happening again?

17:44.121 --> 17:46.189
Yes, it is!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.459
- It is what?
- Happening.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.194
- What is?
- It is.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.784
- It is what?
- It is happening.

17:53.785 --> 17:56.266
- When?
- Now.

17:56.267 --> 17:59.602
- For the first time?
- No, again.

17:59.603 --> 18:04.073
- So, in summary...
- It is happening again!

18:04.074 --> 18:05.769
Yes! Yes!

18:05.770 --> 18:07.814
And what do you think
is going to happen to us?

18:07.815 --> 18:11.547
The ghost could suck us
into another dimension!

18:11.548 --> 18:14.183
And what is the worst thing
that could happen to us there?

18:14.184 --> 18:17.744
The ghost could melt our faces off!

18:17.745 --> 18:22.258
- And then what would happen?
- We'd have no faces!

18:22.259 --> 18:24.922
Chyna: Okay, just
answer this question...

18:24.923 --> 18:30.823
At the end of our lives, what
is going to happen to all of us?

18:31.136 --> 18:35.333
Quite a spiritual and
insightful question, Chyna.

18:35.334 --> 18:40.445
But one I don't have time to answer
right now because we're all going to die!

18:40.446 --> 18:42.736
Yes! Yes! That's great.

18:42.737 --> 18:46.822
- We're all going to die!
- [Girl screaming]

18:46.823 --> 18:50.183
- [Screaming]
- [Screaming]

18:50.184 --> 18:51.365
Sweet buttered beans!

18:51.366 --> 18:54.366
Sweet buttered beans!

18:57.801 --> 19:02.166
Okay, so you don't feel homesick,
let's recreate your bedtime routine.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.747
Okay.

19:03.748 --> 19:06.203
I don't want to go to bed!

19:06.204 --> 19:09.204
I'm not even tired!

19:10.242 --> 19:12.143
This still doesn't feel like home.

19:12.144 --> 19:13.563
Why not?

19:13.564 --> 19:17.215
Because my family lives on a houseboat.

19:17.216 --> 19:19.801
I miss the gentle breeze.

19:19.802 --> 19:22.360
The calming motion of the waves...

19:22.361 --> 19:24.939
And the smell of the salty ocean spray.

19:24.940 --> 19:28.534
Well, I guess I could
rig something, and...

19:28.535 --> 19:33.335
It actually sounds like
it could be relaxing.

20:15.474 --> 20:16.840
Ah...

20:16.841 --> 20:18.761
Home.

20:20.345 --> 20:23.082
How am I going to explain
to Lexi's mother and father

20:23.083 --> 20:27.103
that she was butchered by a ghost?

20:27.712 --> 20:33.324
This is going to make her
parent-teacher conference very awkward.

20:33.325 --> 20:37.394
Yeah, can we do that again? I feel
like I was just a little too lifeless.

20:37.395 --> 20:40.335
Lexi, you're alive!

20:41.332 --> 20:43.972
No, she's not.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.388
Lexi is one of the undead!

20:46.389 --> 20:49.842
The ghost has taken over her body!

20:49.843 --> 20:52.519
Guys! Quit making up your own lines!

20:52.520 --> 20:55.092
You're ruining my movie!

20:55.093 --> 20:57.415
This is a movie?

20:57.416 --> 20:59.156
You're Chyna's brother.

20:59.157 --> 21:02.487
Chyna, you have a brother?

21:02.488 --> 21:05.518
I did not give you
permission to shoot here!

21:05.519 --> 21:08.096
Of course not. You're
the creepy janitor.

21:08.097 --> 21:10.795
I am not the creepy janitor!

21:10.796 --> 21:13.856
I am the creepy CEO!

21:15.200 --> 21:16.928
Cameron...

21:16.929 --> 21:19.621
Mr. Grundy said we
couldn't shoot at Z-Tech.

21:19.622 --> 21:24.442
But you were so excited about making your
movie, I didn't have the heart to tell you.

21:24.443 --> 21:26.411
I'm sorry I lied.

21:26.412 --> 21:27.985
To both of you.

21:27.986 --> 21:31.406
Chyna, you are in trouble.

21:31.451 --> 21:34.194
You know, even though you told me how

21:34.195 --> 21:39.224
"you're going to get in trouble" was
going to end, this is still riveting.

21:39.225 --> 21:45.125
I think my favorite character is
Olive, the wisecracking sidekick.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.969
Chyna, you got in
trouble just to help me?

21:48.970 --> 21:52.603
Suddenly, I feel bad that
I ate the whole lasagna.

21:52.604 --> 21:57.541
Not just emotionally, I
actually do feel pretty bad.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.822
Thank you.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.924
Mr. Grundy, I'm sorry, too.

22:04.925 --> 22:07.218
I never would have put you
in the movie had I known.

22:07.219 --> 22:10.068
You put me in the movie?

22:10.069 --> 22:13.051
Yeah. You're the best
actor in this whole thing.

22:13.052 --> 22:14.186
[Laughing]

22:14.187 --> 22:20.087
Excuse me, but if he were here I bet the
Director, Cameron, would beg to differ.

22:21.433 --> 22:24.202
You really thought I was good?

22:24.203 --> 22:29.207
You know, I don't know see why Cameron
can't finish the rest of his movie here.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.608
Starring me.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.720
And action!

22:39.251 --> 22:42.071
Oh! Gasp! Oh, no!

22:42.386 --> 22:47.223
The ghost has stolen the lives
of these helpless schoolgirls!

22:47.224 --> 22:49.924
I am so scared!

22:52.196 --> 22:56.166
Cut! Zoltan, that was
incredible. Totally amazing.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.191
Chyna, that was terrible.
Totally unusable!

22:59.192 --> 23:04.256
Well, I think now that he's actually
acting, he can't actually act.

23:04.257 --> 23:07.271
Well, this isn't working,
I need real terror.

23:07.272 --> 23:11.589
[Elevator dinging] Help!
Help! He's trying to kill me!

23:11.590 --> 23:14.175
Angus, you're in the movie, too?

23:14.176 --> 23:17.667
What movie? I'm talking about Fletcher!

23:17.668 --> 23:20.175
Where you going, Angus?

23:20.176 --> 23:22.716
It's nap time.
