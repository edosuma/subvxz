- Ah, Ms. Crowne.
Thank you for coming.

02:41.770 --> 02:42.872
- I guess it couldn't wait?

02:42.896 --> 02:43.912
- I'm afraid not.
Please.

02:51.738 --> 02:53.507
- Yellow?
Sounds serious.

02:53.531 --> 02:54.634
- Well, it doesn't need to be.

02:54.658 --> 02:57.218
- My levels are fine, thank you.

02:59.287 --> 03:01.630
- It's come to my attention
that you are engaged

03:01.706 --> 03:03.506
in an exclusive
sexual relationship...

03:03.583 --> 03:04.674
- I beg your... hold on.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.937
- With Henry Foster,
an Alpha Plus,

03:05.961 --> 03:07.761
for over two months now.

03:07.837 --> 03:09.440
- No, that's not accurate.
I don't think...

03:09.464 --> 03:11.431
- This is last week.

03:11.508 --> 03:13.308
You do remember?

03:13.343 --> 03:14.601
- Ah, this was a Monday.

03:14.678 --> 03:16.478
Executive bathroom
above the gestational wing.

03:16.513 --> 03:17.615
- Wait, that's not...

03:17.639 --> 03:18.991
- Two Thursdays ago.
The breezeway.

03:19.015 --> 03:20.607
Previous Tuesday.
Twice.

03:20.684 --> 03:21.869
- Stop.
- The prior Monday.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.985
Monday before that.
Oh, lots of Mondays.

03:24.062 --> 03:25.829
- Stop, please.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.383
- Oh, no.
There's no need for shame.

03:27.407 --> 03:28.901
Lenina,

03:28.925 --> 03:31.087
I assure you I'm quite used to
this sort of thing.

03:31.111 --> 03:33.036
It comes with the job.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.672
Well, I understand the impulse.

03:38.034 --> 03:39.843
He's handsome, strapping, tall.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.586
Ah, yes.

03:41.663 --> 03:44.756
Our Henry Foster is every bit
the Alpha Plus, isn't he?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.828
What I can never seem
to wrap my head around, though,

03:46.852 --> 03:49.678
is the... selfishness.

03:49.754 --> 03:54.544
I mean, two people engaged
in possessive, monogamous...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.546
Forgive me, I don't know
what else to call it...

03:56.570 --> 03:59.363
Relations in private, separate,

03:59.439 --> 04:01.064
with no regard
for the social body,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.983
no consideration
for the pain they cause,

04:03.059 --> 04:03.942
the damage they inflict...

04:04.019 --> 04:05.944
- No.

04:06.021 --> 04:08.488
- Sorry, did you say "no"?
- It was a few times.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.093
- 22.
- It just happened.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.544
You can understand that,
can't you?

04:11.568 --> 04:12.793
It was purely sexual.

04:12.869 --> 04:13.785
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

04:13.862 --> 04:14.880
- First we began to talk,

04:14.904 --> 04:16.329
to prefer each other's company,

04:16.406 --> 04:17.859
and I just thought that
that was...

04:17.883 --> 04:19.833
- No, you didn't.

04:19.909 --> 04:22.335
You did not think.

04:22.412 --> 04:25.672
You gave no thought whatsoever
to anyone but yourself.

04:25.749 --> 04:27.869
Not your colleagues,
not your friends...

04:27.893 --> 04:30.343
All of whom have just as much
a right to Henry Foster

04:30.420 --> 04:31.594
as you do.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.432
Or do you not agree with that?

<i># #</i>

04:39.846 --> 04:40.962
Lenina?

04:42.891 --> 04:45.775
- Everyone belongs
to everyone else.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.661
- Yes.
That's right.

04:47.738 --> 04:49.904
Good.
That's... good.

04:51.566 --> 04:53.575
Well, that's over now.

04:53.651 --> 04:54.971
And I've found,
with things like this,

04:54.995 --> 04:56.578
it's best to get
right back in the mix,

04:56.654 --> 04:57.704
to focus on one's duty.

04:57.781 --> 04:58.863
And if you like,

04:58.941 --> 05:00.674
I can recommend
a few excellent, um...

05:03.119 --> 05:04.711
Go on.

05:04.788 --> 05:06.616
A soma a day keeps
the jimjams away.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.641
- You wouldn't happen
to have something more...

05:13.713 --> 05:15.981
- An orange for you?

05:18.635 --> 05:21.770
This really isn't
your fault, Lenina.

05:21.846 --> 05:24.064
You're a Beta.
Henry Foster's the Alpha here...

05:24.140 --> 05:26.441
- Beta Plus.

05:26.518 --> 05:28.204
I'm a Beta Plus.
- Yeah, no. Of course.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.539
All I mean is that you can't be
expected to think so far ahead.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.697
Henry needed to consider
the bigger picture.

05:32.774 --> 05:34.644
And Henry...

05:34.668 --> 05:36.067
Well, Henry didn't.

05:36.145 --> 05:39.463
Nor did he consider all
of those who might desire you.

05:41.157 --> 05:42.466
- At least not until today.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.170
- Henry... Henry told you?

05:47.247 --> 05:49.672
- It's not important.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.509
What's important
is that we caught it in time.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.636
These things have a habit of...

05:54.712 --> 05:59.608
festering jealousy,
possessiveness, secrecy.

06:01.803 --> 06:05.480
Lenina, you're going to take
the recommended actions

06:05.557 --> 06:07.023
and you are gonna feel better.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.441

I swear I'll report you.

- Yes.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.759
What, uh... what happened?

10:44.836 --> 10:47.771
- Our residents were enjoying
a recreation session.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.234
Satisfaction levels
were quite high

10:50.258 --> 10:52.818
until one of the Epsilons, he...

10:54.929 --> 10:56.090
He had an accident.

- How rare.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.991
Show me?

11:03.396 --> 11:05.905
They do happen, you know.
Accidents.

11:05.982 --> 11:07.822
I've seen one myself.
- Yes.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.794
But it seems that
this accident was...

11:10.870 --> 11:12.712
Well, see if you can
make sense of it.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.007

Why waste it here, all right?

12:42.804 --> 12:44.515
Clear the residents
from the area, yeah?

12:44.539 --> 12:46.141
And tell these Epsilons
not to touch anything

12:46.165 --> 12:48.257

what was left of him, and...

15:24.699 --> 15:26.527
I tried to imagine what it...

15:26.551 --> 15:28.668
What it must have been like
to... to... to climb up

15:28.744 --> 15:30.294

and to plan it.

15:30.371 --> 15:32.107
I mean, to choose it.
- You lost me.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.850
Choose what?
- To end himself, to die.

15:33.874 --> 15:35.725
- I don't understand.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.682
- 'Cause he jumped.
- Jumped?

15:39.255 --> 15:41.042
You make no sense.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.776
Why would he?
No one's ever done that.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.310
- If he was in pain, if...
- He could take a soma.

15:46.387 --> 15:48.688
- What if soma didn't work?
- But it does.

15:48.764 --> 15:50.450
- What if I said that
there's a kind of pain

15:50.474 --> 15:52.617
that... that...
That soma doesn't touch?

15:52.694 --> 15:53.870
- I'd tell you to take a soma.

15:55.604 --> 15:57.374
It's not funny.

15:57.398 --> 15:59.323
- I felt it... what he felt.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.294
I... I... I touched him, and...
- An Epsilon?

16:01.318 --> 16:02.251
- The must have been
some part of him

16:02.328 --> 16:03.328
that was still connected

16:03.404 --> 16:04.531
to the network...
- Bernard.

16:04.555 --> 16:05.882
- To Indra,
to everyone... I mean, to me...

16:05.906 --> 16:07.790
- The Epsilon?
- Yes.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.300
Are you listening?

16:09.377 --> 16:11.761
- Not even sure they have
feelings, the Epsilons.

16:14.248 --> 16:16.549
Oh, don't do that.
You know what I mean.

16:16.625 --> 16:17.800
I mean...

16:17.877 --> 16:19.602
feel like we do.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.312
- They feel the same.

16:22.631 --> 16:25.182
- You're not well.
- I'm fine.

16:25.259 --> 16:27.154
I'm just... I'm trying
to explain something to you,

16:27.178 --> 16:28.586
something important.

16:28.663 --> 16:31.223
- And I am listening.
I always listen, don't I?

16:31.265 --> 16:32.968
'Cause I'm your friend, Bernard.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.846
And as your friend, I'm going
to tell you this one time only.

16:35.870 --> 16:39.664
These feelings you described,

16:39.741 --> 16:42.291
these aren't Epsilon feelings.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.410
These are Bernard feelings.

16:44.487 --> 16:45.589
- No, this is not
anything like that.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.238
- Oh, please.

16:47.314 --> 16:48.842
How many times
have you sat in that very chair

16:48.866 --> 16:50.185
and then complained about...
- This is different.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.928
- "No one respects me
at the Hatchery.

16:51.952 --> 16:53.180
"I don't feel like
an Alpha Plus.

16:53.204 --> 16:54.281
- Stop it.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.807
- "I never know what
to say to people.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.381
I'm Bernard."

16:57.458 --> 16:58.769

that I connected with...

16:58.793 --> 16:59.793
I had a vision.

16:59.835 --> 17:03.332
- No, you had a bad afternoon.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.317
You said you had no soma, right?

17:05.341 --> 17:06.943
- I ran... I ran out 'cause
I had to give it all to...

17:06.967 --> 17:09.226
- Right. So there you have it.

17:09.303 --> 17:11.823
You were overtaxed.
Simple as that.

17:11.847 --> 17:15.232
This Epsilon fell. Upsetting...
- He jumped.

17:15.309 --> 17:17.869
- Stop it!
I don't want to hear it.

17:25.986 --> 17:27.411
- What are you doing?

17:27.488 --> 17:29.591
- I'm arranging for you
to have my table

17:29.615 --> 17:31.624
at the Pleasure Garden tonight.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.637
- Why would you do...
Please don't...

17:33.661 --> 17:36.253
- You will go there, you will
meet some young, eager thing,

17:36.330 --> 17:38.464
and you will do
what is expected of a man

17:38.541 --> 17:39.924
in your position.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.593
You want to make
a connection, Bernie?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.595
Well, make it there.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.316
'Cause quite frankly, my friend,

17:46.340 --> 17:50.226

you're nothing at all.

18:09.530 --> 18:12.590
- Says who?
And who says I'm teasing?

18:12.667 --> 18:15.459
- What happened to "never
go minus before midnight"?

18:15.536 --> 18:18.921
- I'm just... testing the range
of my "come hither."

18:18.998 --> 18:21.017
- Well, lucky you.
You won't need it tonight.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.634
- Lucky me.

18:23.711 --> 18:26.957
So here's what I'm thinking.
- Hmm?

18:26.981 --> 18:28.898

Be honest.

18:30.968 --> 18:33.644
- Hmm... mm.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.814

Okay. Fine.

18:36.891 --> 18:39.900
Too many memories anyway.

- Wow, that is...

18:41.896 --> 18:45.392
- What?
Not his thing?

18:45.416 --> 18:46.657
- It's not anyone's thing.

Everybody likes Sexy Cat.

it's not a good idea.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.074

to check the firing pin

in the show...

Firing pin, prop boy.

Do your job!

We don't do it right,
then maybe they stop coming.

25:41.323 --> 25:43.167
And if they stop coming,
we don't eat.

gonna make me wait for you.

No, I mean,
you should know this...

31:43.635 --> 31:45.297
- No.
- Yes, it's who you are...

Hey, John.

34:02.524 --> 34:04.583
- Madysun?

34:15.879 --> 34:18.338
- Are you in pain?

34:18.414 --> 34:19.767
- Pain?
No.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.392
I mean, maybe you could
untie my wrists.

34:29.008 --> 34:31.485
Who are you?
Where's Madysun?

34:31.561 --> 34:35.842
Madysun?
Madysun!

34:35.866 --> 34:37.324
Where is she?

34:41.780 --> 34:43.850
- Come with me.

34:43.874 --> 34:46.282
I wanna show you something.

Stay with me.

You know what that is?

35:05.670 --> 35:07.929
- I work there.

35:08.006 --> 35:10.482
- What you see there is
an obscenity.

35:12.719 --> 35:16.521
These outsiders come here,
take our land.

35:16.598 --> 35:19.241
They build that insult
for their own amusement.

35:21.394 --> 35:24.571
I don't like being laughed at.

35:24.647 --> 35:27.073
Do you?

35:27.150 --> 35:29.325
- No.

35:29.402 --> 35:32.453
- So why'd you let them?

35:35.533 --> 35:37.862
- Madysun?
Madysun.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.920
- She can't help you.
- I think you made a mistake.

35:40.997 --> 35:42.641
I think you have
the wrong person.

35:42.665 --> 35:44.382
Madysun!

35:44.459 --> 35:47.427
- We need you, John.

35:47.503 --> 35:50.346
I watch you...

35:50.423 --> 35:53.516
every day...

35:53.593 --> 35:56.653
washing those cars.

35:56.730 --> 35:59.022
Putting on plays
for these outsiders,

35:59.098 --> 36:01.928
these New Worlders.

36:01.952 --> 36:04.828
They love nothing.
They believe in nothing.

36:07.649 --> 36:10.209
Look at that blue horror
out there.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.996
Burns you and me to ash
if we so much as touch it,

36:15.073 --> 36:18.082
and yet, they walk
right through.

36:18.159 --> 36:21.377
How do they do that?

36:21.454 --> 36:24.556
Makes you wonder
if they're even human.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.583
You wanna know what's in there?
- No.

36:33.216 --> 36:35.892
- Your destiny.
- No, no.

36:35.969 --> 36:37.797
No!
Wait!

36:37.821 --> 36:39.896
No, no.

36:39.973 --> 36:42.824
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

36:42.901 --> 36:46.536
- A chance to live or die by
your own wits, your own will.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.750
Open your eyes.

36:54.079 --> 36:58.831
We're going to tear it
all down, John,

36:58.908 --> 37:02.655
take back what's ours.

37:02.679 --> 37:05.838
- What do you want me to do?

37:05.915 --> 37:09.008
- You're asking
the wrong question, sweetheart.

37:09.085 --> 37:11.811
The question you gotta
ask yourself is "What am I?"

37:16.217 --> 37:20.728
A free human being?

37:20.805 --> 37:22.405
Or a washer of cars?

<i>- That's unacceptable, Bernard.</i>

40:40.213 --> 40:42.889

40:42.965 --> 40:45.349
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

40:45.426 --> 40:49.937
<i>Privacy is a vice the social
body simply can't afford.</i>

40:50.014 --> 40:53.649

<i>But then, you're not quite
an Alpha, are you?</i>

41:02.818 --> 41:06.232
- I'm an Alpha Plus, sir.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.672
<i>- Clean yourself.</i>

41:10.493 --> 41:13.252
<i>Explain this.</i>

41:13.329 --> 41:15.237
- It's a grapefruit.

41:15.315 --> 41:18.758
<i>- It's the grapefruit you
dropped at the incident today.</i>

41:18.834 --> 41:20.602
<i>Why would you do such a thing?</i>

41:24.090 --> 41:25.943
<i>You are to assess
emotional trauma</i>

41:25.967 --> 41:27.903

41:38.854 --> 41:41.122

41:43.126 --> 41:44.959

41:51.450 --> 41:53.112
<i>To be honest, Bernard,
you don't look well.</i>

41:53.136 --> 41:54.802
- I'm... I'm fine, sir.

41:54.879 --> 41:57.213
<i>- Not well at all.</i>

41:57.290 --> 42:00.424
<i>Depleted, exhausted.</i>

42:00.501 --> 42:02.143
<i>Have you considered a vacation?</i>

42:02.220 --> 42:04.804
<i>It isn't up for debate.</i>

42:04.880 --> 42:07.857
<i>I know just the thing
to sort you out.</i>

42:18.978 --> 42:22.413

Do you want me to be?

42:41.250 --> 42:43.101
- Grateful.

42:43.177 --> 42:46.053
We're giving you a chance.

I like you, John,

43:01.371 --> 43:03.371
Promise me you'll
think about it.

I'd hate for anything

I took, I touched, I gave.

standing there alone,
running away like a coward.

You're a hypocrite.

And it seems that I'm
in some sort of trouble.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.900
I've been told my behavior
is private.

44:22.977 --> 44:25.027
I've been off network.

expected of me,
