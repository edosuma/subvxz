<i>male announcer: On the last</i>
<i>episode of "Ink Master"...</i>

00:04.304 --> 00:05.839
- It's the second week in a row

00:05.905 --> 00:08.608
that we lost one of our friends
and one of our team members.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.176
- This is our time to strike.

00:10.243 --> 00:13.079
<i>announcer: The competition was</i>
<i>shaken to its core.</i>

00:13.146 --> 00:15.048
- This week,
there are no coaches.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.616
There are no teams.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.284
- [bleep]

00:18.351 --> 00:22.122
<i>announcer: And it was every</i>
<i>man or woman for themselves.</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:24.891
- We're gonna fine-tune the
hell out of this thing.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.192
- [groans]

00:26.259 --> 00:27.694
You've got to give
me two seconds, please.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.764
- I'm scared that I cannot
finish this tattoo in time.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.399
{\an3}- Listen, I don't know what
you want me to do.

00:32.465 --> 00:34.033
{\an3}It hurts.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.771
<i>announcer: Alexis and Pony</i>
<i>were the bottom two artists.</i>

00:37.837 --> 00:40.340
- I've been in my head since
I've been here.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.908
Oh, my God, stop it.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.610
- Don't break.
Now is not the time.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.412
<i>announcer: But a massive twist</i>

00:45.478 --> 00:47.914
<i>caused a rift</i>
<i>in the women's team.</i>

00:47.981 --> 00:51.117
- Each of you must call out one
additional artist

00:51.184 --> 00:52.585
to join the face-off.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.522
- I choose Tito.

00:55.588 --> 00:57.223
- I'm gonna call Ash.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.195
<i>- I'm not thinking</i>
<i>about anything</i>

01:02.262 --> 01:03.463
<i>other than sending</i>
<i>Alexis home.</i>

01:03.530 --> 01:04.798
- Do I think that you're
somebody that

01:04.864 --> 01:06.800
I'm going to trust
in the future? No.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.668
<i>announcer:</i>
<i>In the elimination...</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:10.170
- Tito.
- You've got to get rid of

01:10.236 --> 01:11.371
<i>this haphazard look.</i>

01:11.438 --> 01:12.839
- Ash.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.607
a groove here.
- Alexis.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.976
<i>- A lot of outlines in this</i>
<i>tattoo look rough.</i>

01:17.043 --> 01:18.144
- Oh, my God.
- Pony.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.946
<i>It has the look</i>

01:20.013 --> 01:21.848
of needing another session.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.316

01:23.383 --> 01:26.219
Pony, you do not have what

you had to fight on your own,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.985

to ever battle
in this competition.

04:14.287 --> 04:15.855
Duffy Fortner...

04:15.922 --> 04:16.990
- That's right.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.057
- And Sausage.

04:18.124 --> 04:21.694
- [gasps]
- I wanna get him.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.329
- Welcome back.
Nice to see you guys.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.530
- Good to see you guys.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.936
{\an1}- Coaches, your team's survival
is on your shoulders.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.338
Save all your artists from
elimination,

04:32.405 --> 04:33.673

04:33.740 --> 04:36.009
in the Clash of the Coaches
face-off

04:36.075 --> 04:38.077
for $25,000 of your own.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.178

04:40.146 --> 04:41.714
<i>- I've never coached</i>
<i>a sports team,</i>

04:41.781 --> 04:43.916
{\an8}but I've been a mom for
a few years now,

04:43.983 --> 04:46.786
{\an8}so I think I know how
to tell people what to do.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.721
- Sausage, you'll coach
the women's team.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.023
- Hey.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.326
- And Duffy,
you'll coach the men's team.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.527
Go ahead and join your teams.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.429
- Good luck, kid.
- You too.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.597
{\an8}- I really do feel that

04:57.664 --> 04:58.865
{\an8}there's a huge weight
off my shoulders

04:58.931 --> 05:00.433
{\an8}because I don't have to tattoo.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.801
- How are you doing?
- Good.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.436
<i>- But I am now responsible</i>

05:03.503 --> 05:06.205
for the lives of other
people in this competition.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.976
If they go home because of me,
that's a huge weight.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.947
- This week,
we are testing consistency.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.216
<i>- Consistency can take on</i>
<i>a lot of different forms,</i>

05:17.283 --> 05:18.584
{\an8}whether it be through
repetition,

05:18.651 --> 05:20.386
{\an8}where every single
piece repeats,

05:20.453 --> 05:21.921
<i>or it can be seen through</i>
<i>multiple design elements</i>

05:21.988 --> 05:24.090
that remain cohesive
while being different.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.558
- For this flash challenge,

05:25.625 --> 05:28.428
you must transform war into art

05:28.494 --> 05:32.598
by engraving
a full suit of armor.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.600
- What?
- A whole suit?

05:34.667 --> 05:38.004
- Working as a team,
you must consistently engrave

05:38.071 --> 05:40.673
each individual section
of the armor,

05:40.740 --> 05:43.276
creating an elaborate,
cohesive design.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.277
- That's so much.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.812
<i>- This is insane.</i>

05:45.878 --> 05:48.247
{\an8}The fact that we've got to
engrave a full suit of armor--

05:48.314 --> 05:50.116
<i>I'm gonna go crazy.</i>

05:50.183 --> 05:51.684
That's [bleep]ed up. [laughs]

05:51.751 --> 05:53.453
- We are looking
for consistency--

05:53.519 --> 05:56.456
consistency in your style,
consistency in the shape,

05:56.522 --> 05:59.125
in the thickness and
the thinness and the details.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.461
- I'm scared.
- Everything's got to match.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.329
- Easy, right?
- [laughs]

06:03.396 --> 06:04.964
- Win this challenge,
and your team will have

06:05.031 --> 06:08.067
the power to assign
all of the human canvases

06:08.134 --> 06:09.602
in the elimination tattoo.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.037
- We've got to get this.

06:11.104 --> 06:15.608
- You have six hours,
and your time starts...now.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.110
- Let's do it.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.645
- All right, let's get
some sketchbooks.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.813
{\an8}- These artists have
their hands full.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.448
<i>There's seven detachable</i>
<i>pieces</i>

06:22.515 --> 06:24.383
<i>on the suit of armor that</i>
<i>they're gonna be working on.</i>

06:24.450 --> 06:25.852
{\an3}- Instead of trying
to sit there

06:25.918 --> 06:27.820
{\an3}and trying to match
side by side,

06:27.887 --> 06:30.890
{\an3}we can each take an element
and put that element

06:30.957 --> 06:32.992
{\an3}on each individual piece
to show consistency.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.427
- So you're talking about doing
different imagery

06:34.494 --> 06:36.162
within each piece?
- Yes.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.230
{\an8}- Testing consistency

06:37.296 --> 06:38.498
<i>where everybody's working</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:40.299
<i>on a bunch of different</i>
<i>parts is tricky</i>

06:40.366 --> 06:43.169
because this design
has to be seamless throughout.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.838
{\an1}- On the outside of each part
of the armor,

06:45.905 --> 06:47.507
there's these lines,

06:47.573 --> 06:49.842
{\an1}so we can still show
consistency

06:49.909 --> 06:52.078
{\an1}by doing sort of like
this ornate design.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.846
- Making it consistent with,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.381
like, the borders.
- Right.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.683
{\an8}- Just about anything
can go wrong in this challenge,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.653
<i>and trying to get seven women</i>
<i>on the same page</i>

07:00.720 --> 07:02.321
is gonna be super difficult.

07:02.388 --> 07:04.724
That way, there, we don't do
this really intricate piece

07:04.791 --> 07:06.359
over here
and we can't nail it over here.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.361
- I think if we take the entire
piece and have, like,

07:08.427 --> 07:11.297
very elegant fleur-de-lis,
filigree wings--

07:11.364 --> 07:12.365
like, something like that,
you know what I mean?

07:12.431 --> 07:13.366
- That's--that was my plan.

07:13.432 --> 07:14.934
Symmetrical is gonna be tougher

07:15.001 --> 07:16.269
and a little more challenging,

07:16.335 --> 07:18.404
but I think that'll
be more appealing.

07:18.471 --> 07:19.739
- Are we gonna have
a subject matter

07:19.806 --> 07:20.940
as well as filigree?

07:21.007 --> 07:22.308
I mean, like a lion in
the front,

07:22.375 --> 07:23.309
or something like that?
- Yeah, I was thinking

07:23.376 --> 07:24.544
a lion too.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.045
- I think we should break up
into teams

07:26.112 --> 07:29.348
as far as, like, someone, like,
outline certain parts,

07:29.415 --> 07:31.017
and then someone go in
and shade the other parts

07:31.083 --> 07:32.185
so that we're not wasting time.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.920
- It's like
a well-oiled machine.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.022
<i>We are functioning like an</i>
<i>assembly line.</i>

07:36.088 --> 07:37.223
<i>I'm doing the drawing.</i>

07:37.290 --> 07:38.391
<i>Cam is mirroring</i>

07:38.457 --> 07:40.026
<i>my drawing on the other half.</i>

07:40.092 --> 07:42.628
{\an1}- Everything
is pretty much laid out,

07:42.695 --> 07:44.897
and you can take it from there.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.433
{\an8}- We got multiple guys doing
the engraving.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.601
<i>Everybody has a job,</i>

07:48.668 --> 07:51.537
and we're able to
function perfectly.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.372
- This is what--we're gonna
scrub all this background...

07:53.439 --> 07:54.640
- Okay.
- So that way,

07:54.707 --> 07:55.975
this stays all nice and clean
and shiny,

07:56.042 --> 07:57.944
and that background's rough.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.412
- Should I just draw them on
this one,

07:59.478 --> 08:01.447
or should you draw it
on this one?

08:01.514 --> 08:04.517
{\an1}I just want
them to be the same.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.385
{\an3}- I'll do the line work of all
of them,

08:06.452 --> 08:07.854
and then you can take it
and do this, and I'll do

08:07.920 --> 08:10.089
the drilling on that.
- The line work on that?

08:10.156 --> 08:12.291
{\an8}- I am the most consistent
person in this competition,

08:12.358 --> 08:15.127
{\an8}because I am consistently
at the bottom

08:15.194 --> 08:16.729
and consistently
coming back up.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.930
- How you doing, sweetie?

08:17.997 --> 08:19.332
{\an1}- Oh my God,
you just scared me.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.267
{\an3}- Sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.136
- I'm starting to learn how
to work well with these girls.

08:24.203 --> 08:25.905
<i>My attitude is getting better.</i>

08:25.972 --> 08:27.206
- You guys are doing awesome.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.041
{\an3}Taking two legs and then
just rocking them out?

08:29.108 --> 08:30.643
{\an3}Like, you guys are working
really well together.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.010
- Yeah, we usually do.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.511
<i>I don't want to let</i>
<i>my team down,</i>

08:33.578 --> 08:34.914
and I hope they see that.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.616
- Oh, I like these fish legs.
- Isn't that nice?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.217
Evidently, you haven't
went to dragon school,

08:38.284 --> 08:39.619
because they're not fish legs.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.087
- "Dragon school"?
- Dragon school!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.922
- That's really clever.
- They're assholes.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.457
When they come over--
- But that's a typical

08:44.524 --> 08:45.758
tattoo guy for you, though.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.193
- Yeah.
- And the nice thing about

08:47.260 --> 08:50.062

38:44.021 --> 38:45.056
{\an1}to make that look
cross-stitched.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.857
With mine, I'd rather attempt

38:46.924 --> 38:49.326
to do the style that was asked
for than not finish it at all.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.562
- What I see with this
more than anything

38:51.629 --> 38:53.297
is the part that you tattooed

38:53.364 --> 38:55.366
as a comfortable, normal style
of tattooing,

38:55.433 --> 38:56.467
which is the skull,

38:56.534 --> 38:57.968
<i>it just gets away from you.</i>

38:58.035 --> 38:59.503
<i>And that, for me,</i>
<i>is the bummer,</i>

38:59.570 --> 39:01.672
<i>when people that have</i>
<i>tattooed strong--</i>

39:01.739 --> 39:03.374
and because
you get thrown something

39:03.441 --> 39:05.843
that you're not comfortable
with, everything goes with it.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.978
- This is not normally

39:08.045 --> 39:09.346
what any of my black-and-gray
work looks like.

39:09.413 --> 39:11.215
<i>I think just</i>
<i>the overall request</i>

39:11.282 --> 39:12.950
<i>and what I had to work</i>
<i>with was really difficult.</i>

39:13.017 --> 39:14.752
<i>- The application is rough,</i>

39:14.819 --> 39:16.854
the look is rough,
the interpretation is off.

39:16.921 --> 39:18.823
- I definitely tried
my best with this.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.558
- The Xs that are in the fairy

39:20.624 --> 39:22.760
are a hell of a lot cleaner
than what's in his bandana.

39:22.827 --> 39:25.830
The cross-stitching in his hat
or whatever it is

39:25.896 --> 39:27.631
and his chili pepper
is jacked.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.233
There's no real Xs that
are in there.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.836
There's Vs and there's single
lines and what have you.

39:31.902 --> 39:33.671
{\an8}- To me, that's the one

39:33.738 --> 39:36.107
{\an8}that is most legible, and--

39:36.173 --> 39:37.441
- The safest.
- Yes.

39:37.508 --> 39:39.910
The one that's the most
confusing to understand,
