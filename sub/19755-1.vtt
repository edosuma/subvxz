00:27.319 --> 00:29.237
<i>With food...</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:33.241
<i>we can share</i>
<i>and communicate our emotions.</i>

00:49.257 --> 00:55.263
<i>It's that mindset of sharing</i>
<i>that is really what you're eating.</i>

01:05.565 --> 01:09.527
<i>There is no difference between cooking...</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:18.035
<i>and pursuing Buddha's way.</i>

01:20.037 --> 01:26.503
<i>It's been almost half a century</i>
<i>since I entered this way.</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:30.965
<i>I did it</i>

01:31.048 --> 01:36.596
<i>in pursuit of enlightenment.</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:42.018
I am not a chef.

01:42.101 --> 01:45.188
I am a monk.

09:03.876 --> 09:08.881
<i>Everyone calls it "temple food."</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:13.177
<i>The Koreans...</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:18.015
even the monks.

09:30.653 --> 09:35.449
Secular food is focused
on creating dynamic energy.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.537
<i>But temple food</i>

09:40.622 --> 09:45.710
<i>keeps a person's mind calm and static.</i>

09:57.096 --> 10:03.019
<i>When making temple food,</i>
<i>there are five ingredients we don't use:</i>

10:03.102 --> 10:07.649
<i>garlic, onions, scallions,</i>
<i>chives and leeks.</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:10.985
Those are the five pungent spices.

10:13.738 --> 10:18.618
<i>Those five spices are sources</i>
<i>of spiritual energy, but...</i>

10:20.161 --> 10:25.667
too much of that energy
will prevent a monk's spirit

10:25.750 --> 10:30.504
from achieving a state of calmness.

10:33.716 --> 10:40.139
This is a distraction to meditation.

10:47.104 --> 10:53.277
<i>Temple food, the food monks eat,</i>

10:53.360 --> 10:56.530
is flavored with nature.

11:01.035 --> 11:07.959
<i>You see, temple food is extremely simple.</i>

11:08.042 --> 11:13.630
<i>But it uses a lot of seasonings...</i>

11:18.845 --> 11:24.308
<i>like curcuma, sichuan pepper,</i>
<i>brown pepper, shiso.</i>

11:26.518 --> 11:29.438
We never use instant ingredients.

11:29.521 --> 11:35.111
The flavor is based on salt,
soy paste, soy sauce and chili paste.

11:46.580 --> 11:50.835
<i>These ingredients awaken your mind.</i>
<i>They keep you aware.</i>

11:52.503 --> 11:57.842
Temple food is deeply connected

11:57.925 --> 12:01.428
to spiritual energy.

12:34.753 --> 12:41.010
<i>I was born in Yeongju,</i>

12:41.093 --> 12:42.719
<i>a city in North Gyeongsang Province.</i>

12:45.807 --> 12:51.353
I was the fifth
of seven brothers and sisters

12:51.437 --> 12:53.647
and the third daughter.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.069
Is it done?

12:59.070 --> 13:04.116
<i>We had a small farm</i>
<i>and a very happy family.</i>

13:09.663 --> 13:12.834
<i>When I was six or seven...</i>

13:14.001 --> 13:16.545
I enjoyed cooking very much.

13:20.382 --> 13:25.554
<i>I had seen my mother making noodles.</i>

13:28.432 --> 13:32.228
<i>One day,</i>
<i>I tried making them for my parents,</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:35.940
<i>who worked so hard on the farm.</i>

13:36.023 --> 13:39.026
Just as I was finishing the noodles...

13:39.944 --> 13:44.156
my parents returned home.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.244
<i>My mother looked at me and asked...</i>

13:48.327 --> 13:51.455
<i>"Where did you learn to make this?"</i>

13:51.538 --> 13:57.419
I said, "I learned from watching you...

13:58.004 --> 13:59.755
to make you happy."

14:02.049 --> 14:03.968
<i>Mother praised me.</i>

14:04.051 --> 14:07.804
She patted me on the shoulder
and told me,

14:07.889 --> 14:10.975
"You will live well one day."

14:21.944 --> 14:25.489
When I felt the love of my mother,

14:25.572 --> 14:29.451
I wanted to become like her.

14:30.827 --> 14:33.039
The porridge is done.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.710
I learned the mother's way from my mother.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.049
Have some, sister monk.

14:48.304 --> 14:53.225
<i>Preparing a lot of food to share.</i>

14:57.271 --> 15:00.774
As a monk,
I try to practice such a mind...

15:03.569 --> 15:07.198
<i>the mother's mind.</i>

15:10.993 --> 15:14.830
<i>A monk is everyone's mother...</i>

15:18.834 --> 15:22.129
<i>not just to a family,</i>

15:22.213 --> 15:27.593
but to the whole community.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.554
Let us start our meal service.

15:33.515 --> 15:34.725
Wonderful.

19:15.904 --> 19:21.618
When I was young,
my father would say...

19:24.413 --> 19:28.542
<i>"A woman should be able</i>
<i>to make seven dishes with straw.</i>

19:28.625 --> 19:31.878
<i>Only then does she deserve</i>
<i>a good husband."</i>

19:44.225 --> 19:45.642
One day, I got angry.

19:54.901 --> 19:58.405
<i>When my father said that, I told him,</i>

19:58.489 --> 20:03.034
"No, Father.
I'm not trying to find a good husband.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.413
I will live in a small shack
out in the mountains...

20:06.497 --> 20:09.208
surrounded by nature.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.044
I will live all alone."

20:20.093 --> 20:24.806
<i>He said, "Then I will let you stay</i>
<i>up in the mountains,</i>

20:24.890 --> 20:27.976
<i>but I will feel sad."</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:40.572
<i>And, as he said this...</i>

20:41.740 --> 20:43.992
<i>he cried.</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:48.247
I asked, "Why are you crying?"

20:48.330 --> 20:49.415
He answered...

20:51.292 --> 20:56.338
<i>"How can a young girl like you</i>
<i>think like that?"</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:09.726
I thought I had to be alone to be free.

23:20.524 --> 23:26.447
<i>All year long,</i>
<i>plants grow by the energy of nature,</i>

23:26.530 --> 23:31.952
<i>the universe, the earth and human labor.</i>

23:41.545 --> 23:46.717
<i>It's man's greed</i>
<i>that wants the plants to grow faster</i>

23:46.800 --> 23:49.970
and grow bigger and prettier.

23:50.053 --> 23:54.015
That is why some resort
to chemical substances.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.228
But I let the plants in my garden
grow as they want.

25:47.879 --> 25:53.301
<i>After planting the seeds,</i>
<i>I just watch them grow.</i>

25:55.095 --> 25:59.600
They grow in snow, rain,
wind and sunlight.

25:59.683 --> 26:03.519
<i>When it's hot, they grow in heat.</i>
<i>When it's cold, they grow in cold.</i>

26:04.354 --> 26:08.817
<i>I make food from these vegetables</i>
<i>with a blissful mind.</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:12.070
<i>And I eat the vegetables with joy.</i>

28:01.096 --> 28:05.058
<i>I periodically leave the temple</i>
<i>and go into the city.</i>

28:17.946 --> 28:22.533
<i>I want to communicate</i>
<i>with everyone through food.</i>

28:27.580 --> 28:32.668
<i>So I lecture at the Department</i>
<i>of Culinary Arts at Jeonju University.</i>

28:36.047 --> 28:41.136
<i>I have been lecturing</i>
<i>on vegetarian cooking</i>

28:41.219 --> 28:44.848
<i>for five years.</i>

28:46.808 --> 28:49.269
<i>Sugar acts as a preservative.</i>

28:49.352 --> 28:51.687
It acts as a preservative,

28:51.772 --> 28:57.402
which is why we hardly use any sugar.

28:57.485 --> 29:01.239
That's why temple food is considered
healthy and good for your well-being.

29:04.200 --> 29:10.916
Today's young people
have a different way of eating.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.710
<i>Their eating habits</i>
<i>have become westernized.</i>

29:16.046 --> 29:20.633
<i>And with the propagation of fast foods,</i>

29:20.716 --> 29:25.055
<i>they have experienced</i>
<i>a great change in food culture.</i>

29:27.057 --> 29:29.184
<i>I teach because I want the world</i>

29:29.267 --> 29:34.480
<i>to be united</i>
<i>through healthy and happy food</i>

29:34.564 --> 29:38.443
<i>and to thrive together.</i>

29:43.614 --> 29:48.912
Whenever you have leftover flour
or you throw away a lot of ingredients,

29:48.995 --> 29:51.790
that is not acceptable.

29:51.873 --> 29:56.336
You must treasure the ingredients.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.966
<i>I don't consider my activities</i>
<i>to be teaching.</i>

30:01.049 --> 30:04.302
<i>It is communication.</i>

30:07.430 --> 30:10.433
I lecture on the spirit,

30:10.516 --> 30:14.020
the definition of temple food,

30:14.104 --> 30:18.066
why the monks eat temple food,

30:18.149 --> 30:23.029
and how you can change yourself
with temple food

30:23.113 --> 30:26.449
even if you are not a monk.

30:27.993 --> 30:31.997
You need to taste it and right away
understand what is missing.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.541
The tongue is just one part.
All your five senses must move.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.711
The five senses are body, feeling,
perception, intention, and consciousness.

30:38.794 --> 30:41.172
We need to take these things
into consideration when cooking.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.467
<i>Although it is merely progress</i>
<i>toward a goal...</i>

30:45.385 --> 30:51.682
<i>the very action of progressing</i>
<i>with the greatest passion,</i>

30:51.766 --> 30:56.104
with the greatest energy...

30:56.187 --> 30:58.982
is a kind of an enlightenment.

31:22.255 --> 31:28.511
<i>When I was 17,</i>
<i>my mother suddenly passed away.</i>

31:32.891 --> 31:38.188
<i>I was deeply upset when she died so early.</i>

31:41.524 --> 31:44.945
<i>And I realized there was no guarantee</i>

31:45.028 --> 31:49.282
that I wouldn't give my children
the same kind of pain one day.

31:53.744 --> 31:57.457
<i>I vowed never to pass down that pain.</i>

32:04.214 --> 32:07.508
One day, I just disappeared...

32:11.972 --> 32:13.556
<i>without telling anyone.</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:17.477
<i>I didn't take anything with me.</i>

32:19.104 --> 32:21.314
<i>I just decided to be a monk.</i>

32:22.482 --> 32:28.738
In 1974, I left home...

32:30.448 --> 32:33.451
<i>and came to the temple.</i>

32:35.120 --> 32:38.748
<i>The winter sun was setting.</i>

32:38.831 --> 32:40.500
<i>I got off the bus.</i>

32:40.583 --> 32:43.669
I had nothing in my hands.

32:47.966 --> 32:52.387
<i>No money. No things.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

32:55.306 --> 32:57.100
Just a small girl...

32:58.018 --> 33:03.731
going step by step up a mountain.

33:07.693 --> 33:11.322
<i>When I looked up, I saw an old monk.</i>

33:11.406 --> 33:15.535
<i>She asked,</i>
<i>"Did you come here to live?"</i>

33:15.618 --> 33:19.789
I answered, "How did you know?

33:19.872 --> 33:21.749
Yes. I am here to stay."

33:25.961 --> 33:31.634
My mother granted me
the opportunity to enter this temple.

33:31.717 --> 33:36.264
Even today,
I thank her for her mercifulness

33:36.347 --> 33:39.142
and her compassion

33:39.225 --> 33:43.396
for allowing my pursuit...

33:44.189 --> 33:45.940
of the freedom.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.942
<i>Soy sauce...</i>

34:30.025 --> 34:35.698
Soy sauce makes me excited
just thinking about it.

34:36.574 --> 34:41.912
Every food is recreated by soy sauce.

34:48.419 --> 34:52.798
<i>Soy beans, salt and water,</i>

34:52.882 --> 34:55.468
<i>in harmony, through time.</i>

34:58.679 --> 35:03.684
<i>It is the basis of seasonings...</i>

35:03.768 --> 35:05.520
<i>the foundation.</i>

35:05.603 --> 35:08.773
<i>There are sauces aged</i>
<i>five years, ten years...</i>

35:10.483 --> 35:12.860
<i>aged for 100 years.</i>

35:12.943 --> 35:17.448
These kinds of soy sauces
are passed down for generations.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.159
They are heirlooms.

35:25.623 --> 35:30.920
<i>If you look into yourself,</i>
<i>you see past, present and future.</i>

35:31.003 --> 35:35.216
<i>You see that time revolves endlessly.</i>

35:37.177 --> 35:40.471
<i>You can see the past from the present.</i>

35:41.389 --> 35:46.894
<i>By looking into myself,</i>
<i>I see my grandmother, my mother,</i>

35:46.977 --> 35:51.065
<i>the elders in the temple,</i>
<i>and me.</i>

35:54.735 --> 36:01.492
<i>As a result, by making soy sauce,</i>

36:01.576 --> 36:08.499
<i>I am reliving the wisdom of my ancestors.</i>

36:10.501 --> 36:12.212
<i>I am reliving them.</i>

36:13.254 --> 36:17.467
<i>It's not important who or when.</i>

36:18.593 --> 36:24.390
<i>What is important</i>
<i>is that I'm doing it in the present.</i>

36:24.474 --> 36:27.893
<i>I use soy sauce,</i>

36:27.977 --> 36:32.357
<i>and I acknowledge its importance.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:36.902
<i>It is no longer just me</i>
<i>that's doing things.</i>

36:36.986 --> 36:41.241
<i>It's me in the past,</i>
<i>in the present,</i>

36:41.324 --> 36:43.284
<i>and even in the future.</i>

36:44.910 --> 36:49.164
<i>Soy sauce is eternal.</i>
<i>It is life itself.</i>

37:50.560 --> 37:52.437
<i>When you become a monk,</i>

37:52.520 --> 37:56.399
<i>it's not about learning</i>
<i>Buddhism more deeply.</i>

37:57.983 --> 38:00.695
<i>It's about living with Buddhism.</i>

38:02.947 --> 38:04.865
<i>Living with it...</i>

38:06.451 --> 38:08.160
<i>eating with it...</i>

38:09.620 --> 38:10.955
<i>praying...</i>

38:12.498 --> 38:13.833
<i>working...</i>

38:15.710 --> 38:17.295
<i>chopping wood...</i>

38:19.797 --> 38:21.966
<i>pulling weeds...</i>

38:23.676 --> 38:27.680
<i>All of these things become a study.</i>

38:28.806 --> 38:32.267
<i>This is perhaps Buddhism itself.</i>

38:39.692 --> 38:46.407
<i>When I was 17 years old,</i>
<i>I entered the way of a monk.</i>

38:46.491 --> 38:50.285
It was very hard for a young girl.

38:54.957 --> 38:57.710
<i>I had to wake up every day</i>
<i>at 3:00 in the morning.</i>

38:57.793 --> 39:02.297
<i>And, still groggy,</i>
<i>I'd go to morning prayers...</i>

39:03.341 --> 39:07.428
<i>light a fire in the kitchen</i>
<i>and cook breakfast.</i>

39:07.512 --> 39:12.141
Eat breakfast at 6:00
and pray again.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.894
<i>Pray again at 9:00.</i>

39:14.977 --> 39:18.147
<i>Eat lunch at 12:00.</i>

39:18.230 --> 39:22.735
It repeated endlessly without stopping.

39:26.989 --> 39:30.743
<i>I was at the age</i>
<i>where you still need a lot of sleep.</i>

39:30.826 --> 39:36.707
<i>At first, that was the most painful part.</i>
<i>Not enough sleep.</i>

39:39.460 --> 39:44.214
<i>I was always sneaking away</i>
<i>to try and sleep.</i>

39:45.299 --> 39:51.305
<i>One warm spring day,</i>
<i>after chopping wood,</i>

39:51.389 --> 39:56.644
<i>I climbed up a tree and I fell asleep.</i>

39:58.396 --> 40:02.149
I felt something crawling by me.

40:02.232 --> 40:04.151
So I opened my eyes,

40:04.234 --> 40:10.950
and I saw a huge snake
that came down from the tree.

40:11.033 --> 40:17.206
I watched as it crawled down my neck.

40:21.085 --> 40:27.091
<i>I wasn't worried.</i>
<i>I just fell back asleep.</i>

40:36.434 --> 40:38.478
<i>So I wrote to my father...</i>

40:44.900 --> 40:48.946
"Father, I can't take it anymore.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.656
Come and take me back home."

40:53.408 --> 40:56.579
<i>A few days later, my father came.</i>

40:58.873 --> 41:01.083
<i>"My daughter says it is painful for her</i>
<i>to wake up so early,</i>

41:01.167 --> 41:03.127
<i>so I will take her home."</i>

41:05.505 --> 41:07.965
Then the elders said...

41:09.258 --> 41:11.594
"We will let you sleep in the morning.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.180
<i>Sleep later and we will let you</i>
<i>skip the early morning prayers."</i>

41:18.433 --> 41:20.310
<i>Everyone cried.</i>

41:20.394 --> 41:26.942
<i>My father and my brothers</i>
<i>and sisters also cried.</i>

41:30.029 --> 41:35.200
<i>So when I wrote to my father,</i>

41:35.284 --> 41:40.164
<i>it wasn't because I actually wanted</i>
<i>to go home.</i>

41:42.457 --> 41:46.086
I just wanted to see my family
one more time.

42:02.477 --> 42:03.896
Curled squash.

42:06.356 --> 42:09.777
The visitors brought these with them
for us to eat on Buddha's birthday.

42:16.742 --> 42:19.495
Let's go soak them.

43:49.669 --> 43:55.132
Creativity and ego cannot go together.

43:57.802 --> 44:01.889
<i>If you free yourself</i>
<i>from the comparing and jealous mind,</i>

44:01.972 --> 44:05.434
<i>your creativity opens up endlessly.</i>

44:05.517 --> 44:11.774
<i>Just as water springs from a fountain,</i>
<i>creativity springs from every moment.</i>

44:14.735 --> 44:16.528
<i>You must not be your own obstacle.</i>

44:17.738 --> 44:21.909
<i>You must not be owned</i>
<i>by the environment you are in.</i>

44:24.578 --> 44:29.041
<i>You must own the environment,</i>
<i>the phenomenal world around you.</i>

44:29.124 --> 44:35.589
You must be able to freely move
in and out of your mind.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.092
This is being free.

44:46.100 --> 44:49.394
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>you can't open up your creativity.</i>

44:49.478 --> 44:52.231
There is no ego to speak of.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.942
That is my belief.

45:23.345 --> 45:25.931
We will now end the prayer ceremony

45:26.014 --> 45:28.517
of Buddha's birthday
of the Buddhist year 2560.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.146
Please help yourself to the temple food.

45:32.229 --> 45:35.607
Not too much, not too little.

45:35.690 --> 45:41.947
Please eat Buddha's food and be healthy.

45:43.657 --> 45:49.621
<i>My father was 70 years old</i>
<i>and was reflecting upon his life.</i>

45:49.704 --> 45:54.251
He must have felt sorry for me

45:54.334 --> 46:00.715
because I was a monk and never married.

46:02.676 --> 46:07.097
So he came to the temple to live with me.

46:11.143 --> 46:15.230
<i>He wanted to know,</i>
<i>"How do these monks live?"</i>

46:15.314 --> 46:18.400
He wanted to experience it for himself.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.119
<i>At first, he complained.</i>

46:30.913 --> 46:35.417
<i>One day, he comes to dinner and gets mad.</i>

46:35.500 --> 46:40.297
<i>"Everything you eat is vegetarian."</i>

46:40.380 --> 46:44.176
"How do you live
without eating any meat at all?"

46:49.974 --> 46:53.310
<i>My father said,</i>
<i>"I like all the food.</i>

46:53.393 --> 46:57.022
<i>It is clean and elegant,</i>
<i>but I don't have any energy."</i>

46:57.106 --> 46:59.066
<i>He thought he couldn't</i>
<i>get energy from the food</i>

46:59.149 --> 47:01.818
because there wasn't any meat or fish.

47:08.075 --> 47:13.122
<i>So he asked me,</i>
<i>"What's the best food monks eat?"</i>

47:15.249 --> 47:17.709
So I cooked shiitake mushrooms.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.893
<i>I fried them in a pan</i>

47:33.976 --> 47:38.939
<i>with sesame oil and soy sauce.</i>

47:41.984 --> 47:46.530
<i>I gave him the food and told him to eat it</i>
<i>quietly in the mountains near the valley.</i>

47:55.080 --> 47:57.166
<i>"This is better than meat!</i>

47:57.249 --> 48:00.419
<i>You can indeed live without meat</i>
<i>since you have this."</i>

48:06.133 --> 48:11.430
<i>He realized there must be</i>
<i>a kind of peacefulness</i>

48:11.513 --> 48:14.266
<i>in this way of living.</i>

48:28.155 --> 48:32.909
<i>After being there a month,</i>
<i>he called me by my secular name.</i>

48:32.993 --> 48:37.164
<i>"Chunjeong,</i>
<i>I am going back home without worries.</i>

48:37.247 --> 48:40.084
<i>Live well.</i>

48:46.715 --> 48:50.552
<i>They say even the king</i>

48:50.635 --> 48:54.264
<i>does three bows to a monk.</i>

48:54.348 --> 48:56.266
<i>Now I will bow to you."</i>

48:57.434 --> 49:02.356
So my 70-year-old father

49:02.439 --> 49:05.400
bowed to me three times.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.194
And he left.

49:08.112 --> 49:12.866
One week later, he passed in peace,
like falling asleep.

49:15.285 --> 49:16.953
That was his last.

49:42.479 --> 49:46.733
<i>Because of my parents,</i>
<i>I could become a monk.</i>

49:50.695 --> 49:53.740
And I prayed for them

49:53.823 --> 49:57.702
to be happy in the next life.

50:06.586 --> 50:10.006
<i>Even today,</i>
<i>when I see something beautiful,</i>

50:10.090 --> 50:12.967
<i>or make or see beautiful food...</i>

50:13.052 --> 50:18.848
<i>I thank my parents</i>
<i>for their energy and virtue.</i>

50:18.932 --> 50:23.145
The food I prepare is an expression
of gratitude to my parents.

50:23.228 --> 50:27.107
They let me become who I am.

54:54.082 --> 54:59.754
I make food as a meditation.

55:11.433 --> 55:17.647
<i>I am living my life as a monk</i>
<i>with a blissful mind...</i>

55:19.107 --> 55:20.567
<i>and freedom.</i>

55:26.155 --> 55:29.993
<i>I wish you...</i>

55:30.076 --> 55:34.456
<i>a healthy, happy life.</i>

55:35.749 --> 55:37.083
Thank you.
