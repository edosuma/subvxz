WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.920
[people chattering indistinctly]

00:03.003 --> 00:07.466
Hi. Bless you. Same to you. Bless you.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.760
[cellphone rings]

00:11.595 --> 00:14.181
-Can you take over for a second?
-Oh, of course, honey.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.477
[chuckles] You miss me already?

00:18.561 --> 00:20.438
[laughs] Am I that obvious?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.398
-[laughs] I don't mind.
-Good.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.025
'Cause I am cooking dinner
for you tonight.

00:25.109 --> 00:29.113
Roasted chicken,
baby carrots with honey, oh, and rice.

00:29.739 --> 00:32.658
I know it's not much,
but it's what I know how to cook best.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.827
I'm just happy I found
a husband who can cook.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.705
Well, you deserve a special night.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.959
I feel guilty that we haven't been able
to take our honeymoon yet.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.296
You couldn't make me any happier
than I am right now.

00:45.755 --> 00:48.507
I'm here for another half an hour,
and then I'm all yours.

00:48.591 --> 00:49.592
Oh! Um...

00:49.675 --> 00:53.262
I am going to need
a little more time than that.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.515
Um, can you make a stop on your way home?

00:56.599 --> 00:58.058
I picked up a bottle of white,

00:58.142 --> 01:00.436
but I think a nice bottle of red
would be much better.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.772
Can't wait.

01:02.855 --> 01:03.856
Bye.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.322
Hello. I'm home.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.531
[chuckles]

01:13.657 --> 01:17.453
I, uh, maybe splurged a bit
on a Petit Verdot.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.413
But you did say it was a special night.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.417
Kel?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.962
[chuckles] What are you up to?

01:30.174 --> 01:32.176
[suspenseful music playing]

01:40.184 --> 01:42.561
Come on, Kel, pick up.

01:43.229 --> 01:46.440
[automated voice] You've reached a number
that has been disconnected

01:46.524 --> 01:48.025
and is no longer in service.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.319
What the hell is happening?

02:01.580 --> 02:04.750
Oh, my gosh. That coffee smells good.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.211
I didn't sleep a wink.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.422
Every inch of this city
is under construction.

02:10.506 --> 02:13.050
It's like jackhammers are at my headboard.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.470
I slept better in my car
than at the hotel.

02:16.554 --> 02:20.349
There's something in the New York air
that makes sleep useless,

02:20.432 --> 02:23.018
so said Simone de Beauvoir.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.271
Agree to disagree, Simone.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.648
So where are we off to today?

02:27.731 --> 02:31.068
Bavaria for a meeting with the Illuminati?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.278
Treasure hunt in Cairo?

02:32.361 --> 02:33.988
I'm off to a meeting.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.074
You should enjoy your coffee.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.494
No, no, no. Sit, sit, relax.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.829
I was told to keep an eye on you.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.708
I'm willing to offer a compromise.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.168
My burner phone.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.587
Write the number down

02:49.670 --> 02:53.382
and call it whenever you want
to check up on me.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.841
I promise I'll answer.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.094
What am I supposed to do
the rest of the time?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.221
Well, perhaps
you'd prefer to spend the day

02:59.305 --> 03:01.599
pursuing your own personal matters.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.852
You're referring to the check
from the garage sale?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.146
Did you step through that door?

03:07.980 --> 03:08.981
Not yet.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.524
Oh, well.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.445
Why don't you just tell me

03:14.528 --> 03:17.448
what Kathleen Sutton has to do
with my mother's past?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.700
Because, Agent Malik,

03:19.783 --> 03:21.911
some stories can't

03:21.994 --> 03:23.871
just be told.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.665
They have to be discovered.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.252
Call whenever you like.

03:35.341 --> 03:37.009
Hmm. Morning.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.763
After 30 years of marriage,

03:40.846 --> 03:45.017
I can finally tell the difference
between your sexy squint

03:45.100 --> 03:47.227
and your tortured gaze.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.521
And what are my eyes telling you now?

03:49.605 --> 03:51.398
That I'm not getting lucky tonight.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.275
[chuckles] What's going on with you?

03:53.359 --> 03:55.527
Uh, the task force.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.988
We're under a high level of scrutiny.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.616
If we're gonna survive,
we have to prove our worth.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.910
-But we're in a holding pattern.
-Reddington?

04:02.993 --> 04:05.704
Our team relies on
the Blacklist cases that he brings us,

04:05.788 --> 04:08.540
but he's been acting erratically,
more so than usual.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.751
Anything I can do?

04:10.834 --> 04:12.586
Sure.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.046
Find us a case to work on.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.593
There's this young woman
I volunteer with at the meal center,

04:19.677 --> 04:22.596
brand-new to the country,
happiest newlywed in the world,

04:22.680 --> 04:24.682
until her husband vanished
from the apartment.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.102
-Charlene, I was joking.
-Right in the middle of cooking dinner.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.398
Poor thing, she couldn't even get through
her shift yesterday without crying.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.857
I'm very sorry to hear that,

04:33.941 --> 04:36.902
but, uh, it's not exactly
the kind of case is gonna help us.

04:37.861 --> 04:38.946
Oh, so...

04:40.155 --> 04:42.825
The goal of your team
is to help yourselves.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.578
And all this time I thought
it was to help people in trouble.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.746
My mistake.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.712
[Cooper] Okello Okoro.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.631
It's been four days since his wife, Duni,

04:57.715 --> 05:01.301
came home to find him gone
and their apartment ransacked.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.595
She filed a missing persons report,
but so far,

05:03.679 --> 05:05.764
Montgomery County Police
have come up empty.

05:05.848 --> 05:09.018
A missing husband. Really?
I mean, what's Reddington's angle here?

05:09.101 --> 05:10.936
This case didn't come from Reddington.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.312
[Dembe] Who did it come from?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.064
Charlene.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.315
Who's Charlene?

05:16.442 --> 05:18.193
-His wife.
-Oh.

05:18.277 --> 05:22.614
If you got a stronger case, I'm all ears.
We're hanging by a thread here.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.284
Senator Panabaker called me
at home last night

05:25.367 --> 05:28.787
to inform me that Congressman Hudson
has recruited Senator Dorf to his cause.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.873
The head of the Intelligence Committee.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.626
Congressman Hudson won't give up until
he finds out who we are and what we do,

05:34.710 --> 05:35.794
and with Dorf on his side,

05:35.878 --> 05:38.338
Hudson could subpoena our case files
and read everything.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.174
There's nothing to read.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.926
Raymond removed all traces of himself
from those files.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.472
Exactly. We're a task force
built around an invisible

05:46.555 --> 05:48.682
and thoroughly unreliable asset.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.810
If this team's gonna get shut down,

05:51.894 --> 05:55.189
I'd just as soon use our final days
to do some good for somebody.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.942
Dembe and I'll go talk to the wife,
get the full story. What's her name again?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.194
Duni.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.405
You dig into the husband. Okoro.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.407
If he was kidnapped, let's find out why.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.371
This is Agent Ressler and Agent Zuma.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.998
They're good men.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.584
And if anyone can help you, they can.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.211
I can't thank you enough.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.462
You're welcome, dear.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.715
I've never felt so scared.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.593
Why don't you start by telling us more
about your husband?

06:24.676 --> 06:27.763
Charlene tells us you're newlyweds.
How'd you two meet?

06:27.846 --> 06:31.725
Um, on a dating app.
Um, I was living in Kenya at the time.

06:31.809 --> 06:35.354
I think the distance
made us feel safer to open up.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.399
So we started messaging and... [sniffles]

06:41.026 --> 06:42.903
The beautiful messages he wrote.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.907
Before we knew it, we were in love.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.242
So you moved here for him?

06:48.325 --> 06:51.120
Kel offered to come to Kenya,
but he has a good job here,

06:51.203 --> 06:53.413
and I've always wanted to live in America.

06:53.497 --> 06:54.915
So I got here four weeks ago.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.750
We got married right away.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.752
I know you think your husband was taken,

06:58.836 --> 07:01.255
but is there
any chance he left on his own?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.798
Many men get cold feet.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.508
No, not Kel.

07:05.384 --> 07:06.718
We're in love.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.930
Now, are you aware of anything
he might be running from?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.974
-Any debts?
-[Duni] Not that I know of.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.184
Like I said, he has a stable career.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.479
Why are you asking me these questions?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.024
We checked your husband's financials.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.820
His bank account was emptied
the same day he vanished.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.782
Whoever abducted Kel
must have known about my parents' money.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.576
Your parents' money?

07:31.410 --> 07:32.536
The dowry.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.747
They transferred it into Kel's account
just this week.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.459
Seventy-five thousand dollars.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.170
It was all my family had.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.173
If Kel's account is empty,

07:44.256 --> 07:47.217
then whoever took him
must have taken the dowry, too.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.302
[door opens]

07:49.428 --> 07:52.347
Dowries? I didn't realize
that was still a thing.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.392
In some African and Asian countries,
they continue to be given,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.936
but they're largely illegal.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.981
I imagine that would make them
pretty appealing for a criminal.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.275
"I can't stop it.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.528
I can't stop it any more
than I can stop a wind from blowing

08:06.612 --> 08:08.280
or a wave from crashing.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.531
I want to be with you.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.283
I want to be with you now.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.332
I'm tired of living this charade.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.500
The me that others know has died.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.337
I need to shed myself
of this dry, scratchy skin

08:23.420 --> 08:25.339
and be reborn in you. In us."

08:25.422 --> 08:26.798
[Ishaan] Jemma!

08:26.882 --> 08:27.966
What? What is it?

08:28.634 --> 08:31.887
I just received an alert from the bank.
The transfer came through.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.013
[laughs]

08:38.227 --> 08:40.062
[line ringing]

08:40.145 --> 08:43.523
I just received the dowry.
Another job well done.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.234
You ready for another target?

08:45.317 --> 08:47.611
Hell yeah.
Whatever you need, I'm your guy.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.780
I'm just working on
a new woman from Senegal

08:49.863 --> 08:52.157
who is almost ready to make real contact.

08:52.241 --> 08:54.576
I'll send you
your new ID packet this weekend.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.454
First, I just need
to wrap out another case.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.211
-[door opens]
-[man] Good morning, beautiful.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.879
[laughs] Morning.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.548
I'm excited for today.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.010
I cannot wait to make you my wife.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.306
[woman giggles]

09:33.615 --> 09:34.616
Hello?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.285
-Mrs. Sutton?
-Mm-hmm.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.911
We didn't get a chance to meet,

09:37.995 --> 09:41.456
but I was at a garage sale
you went to a few days ago.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.708
Oh, dear.

09:42.790 --> 09:46.253
Please tell me that nice man in the hat
isn't asking for his stamp back.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.963
No, nothing like that.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.382
Special Agent Siya Malik with the FBI.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.968
I was wondering
if I could ask you some questions.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.723
[door closes]

09:57.806 --> 09:59.182
Here. Please take a seat.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.687
I'm not sure how much help I'll be.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.731
My Nigel worked for the Foreign Office,

10:05.814 --> 10:08.692
but he couldn't get into specifics
of what he did.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.404
I'm looking for information
about a woman, a CIA agent,

10:12.487 --> 10:16.992
who I guess was a liaison
to your husband about 25 years ago.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.285
Does that ring any bells?

10:18.368 --> 10:20.412
[chuckles] Oh, I don't know.

10:20.495 --> 10:24.207
Nigel was stationed overseas
most of his career,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.085
and I lived stateside.
That's why we wrote so many letters.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.713
And closer to his...

10:30.255 --> 10:33.216
Closer to the end,
he was reassigned to London.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.928
I met a few of his coworkers
before he died in the line of duty.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.057
But, uh, the period is such a blur for me.

10:40.599 --> 10:41.933
I'm sorry for your loss.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.602
Mm, I appreciate that.

10:45.395 --> 10:49.524
Well, actually,
I do remember one colleague

10:49.608 --> 10:51.360
who I met at Nigel's service.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.362
-A woman?
-Yes.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.946
She gave me her business card,

10:55.030 --> 10:58.033
and she said if I ever needed any help
to reach out.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.370
What was her name? Was it Meera Malik?

11:01.453 --> 11:03.372
Hmm. No, that's not her.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.956
Ah, what was her name?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.666
It was, uh...

11:06.750 --> 11:09.544
Regina. That was it.

11:09.628 --> 11:11.671
Regina Saint.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.133
-Are you sure?
-[chuckles] I am.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.678
I remember thinking it was a lovely name

11:19.596 --> 11:21.014
at a dreadful time.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.061
[Herbie] According to her file,

11:26.144 --> 11:28.814
Regina Saint worked for the CIA
for 23 years.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.274
She was your mother's case officer
at one point,

11:31.358 --> 11:34.069
and she's now retired
in St. Augustine, Florida.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.404
All right, I'm sending you

11:35.487 --> 11:38.615
all the information I have
on Regina Saint right now.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.075
[cellphone dings]

11:40.158 --> 11:42.077
Got it. Thanks so much for your help.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.371
Yeah, no problem.
So how are things going with Reddington?

11:44.454 --> 11:46.915
Oh, he lives in a decrepit bath house

11:46.998 --> 11:48.333
and makes great coffee.

11:48.417 --> 11:49.668
Not much else to report.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.086
Uh, I gotta run. Duty calls.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.589
Where are we with the missing husband?

11:54.673 --> 11:58.301
Uh, well, based on what I found,
"missing" is a relative term.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.097
Security footage from Okoro's bank
the day he was kidnapped.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.016
If there's any question,
what you're looking at is Okello Okoro...

12:05.100 --> 12:06.226
Say that three times fast.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.727
...draining his account dry.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.522
If his hand's being forced,
he doesn't look under duress to me.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.648
Check out the timestamp.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.943
That's an hour before
his heartbroken bride called 911.

12:15.026 --> 12:18.155
Missing husband or thieving bastard?
You make the call.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.907
[Ressler] After we talked to the wife,
Dembe and I did some digging.

12:20.991 --> 12:24.202
This guy's entire identity is fabricated.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.456
Okello Okoro's Social Security number
belonged to an infant

12:27.539 --> 12:29.916
that died in childhood in 1982.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.211
His birth certificate lists a hospital
that has no records of him,

12:33.295 --> 12:34.921
and his marriage certificate is a fake.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.131
So he's a con man.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.757
[Ressler] Well,
that suggests an individual.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.843
Now, given the intricacies of his scam,

12:39.926 --> 12:42.179
we believe Okoro is part
of a larger operation.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.264
Okay. There may be
other victims out there.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.349
We need to find Okoro's real identity.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.602
I want all of you
to head to Duni's apartment.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.895
Armed with this new information,

12:49.978 --> 12:52.898
maybe we can find something
local PD missed.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.569
-[door opens]
-[woman laughing]

12:57.652 --> 13:00.322
-Voilà!
-[laughs] You're going to hurt yourself.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.406
What do you mean?

13:01.490 --> 13:04.159
I've been secretly working out
in preparation for this very moment.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.744
So you think I'm heavy?

13:06.328 --> 13:07.662
You're perfect.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.457
I'm going to call my parents
to tell them the good news.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.209
No! Uh, stay.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.002
I mean, they're probably
fast asleep anyways.

13:14.085 --> 13:17.797
You clearly have never met my parents.
They're up and waiting. I guarantee it.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.927
Plus, I want them to send over my dowry
so we can get out of this man cave,

13:22.010 --> 13:24.721
find a respectable place
to start our lives together.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.931
All right, fair enough.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.308
But as soon as they send the money,

13:28.391 --> 13:30.810
we're gonna get you a ring
and a proper honeymoon.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.103
I want to do this right.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.065
You should have everything
you've ever wanted.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.526
I do. I have you.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.537
How could I have been so naive?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.706
I really thought we were in love.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.626
Kel was so sweet and emotional.

13:54.709 --> 13:58.255
You should read the messages he wrote me.
He spoke straight to my heart.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.299
We need to figure out
who your husband really is.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.843
The police didn't find
any of his fingerprints here.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.054
He wiped the place down clean
before he left.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.765
Have you seen any of his personal items
that could help us?

14:09.683 --> 14:10.684
No.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.270
These things still have
the price tags left on them.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.398
This entire apartment
is staged for your benefit.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.567
Just like they staged his kidnapping.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.569
Now, we suspect that he had accomplices.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.612
Did you ever meet any of his friends?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.197
No, never.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.117
God, I feel like such a fool.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.328
How am I going to tell my family
that I lost all of their money?

14:30.412 --> 14:31.496
They'll disown me.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.915
[Dembe] You were victimized by a thief.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.292
Your family will come around.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.418
[Herbie] Ah-ha!

14:36.501 --> 14:38.795
The man you know as Kel did a fine job

14:38.878 --> 14:41.381
of cleaning his wayward hairs
and dead skin cells,

14:41.464 --> 14:43.508
but nobody can remember everything.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.802
-I just pulled a clean print.
-From where?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.179
-The toilet.
-He didn't clean the toilet?

14:48.263 --> 14:49.723
He cleaned most of the toilet.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.976
But lucky for us, Kel is a stand-up guy.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.937
As in he stands to pee,
which means he has to lift the seat.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.523
[Dembe] You found his fingerprint
underneath the toilet seat?

14:58.607 --> 14:59.733
Gross.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.860
Have you changed a diaper recently?

15:01.943 --> 15:04.070
Okay, let's run that print, get the ID.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.534
I confess, I'm usually
the one avoiding meetings,

15:09.618 --> 15:11.286
not requesting them.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.872
Well, I've been following
your employer's operations,

15:13.955 --> 15:16.791
ventures in Brazil and Uruguay.

15:16.875 --> 15:19.919
And now he's set his sights on the US.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.340
Santoro is almost as hungry
as I was at his age.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.424
Mr. Reddington,

15:24.507 --> 15:27.552
my employer will consider that
the highest compliment coming from you.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.054
Then why isn't he here?

15:30.305 --> 15:32.098
Why did he send you?

15:32.182 --> 15:35.810
All of Mr. Santoro's
business matters go through me.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.480
So, what are we here to discuss?

15:38.563 --> 15:40.315
Why don't we start with the bribing

15:40.398 --> 15:43.652
of Florida's
Regional Environmental Officer?

15:43.735 --> 15:48.573
There's currently a multibillion-dollar
contract up for grabs

15:48.657 --> 15:50.950
to reinforce the Gulf coastline.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.245
Mr. Santoro is a businessman.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.915
He had every right to make a bid for that.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.042
[chuckles] Santoro is a crook.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.504
He couldn't care less
about the effects of climate change.

16:02.587 --> 16:07.550
He's gonna fill those jobs
with all his underworld connections

16:07.634 --> 16:09.469
and rake in the kickbacks.

16:09.552 --> 16:10.679
Stop me when I'm wrong.

16:12.931 --> 16:17.686
My employer grew up
in the favelas of Sao Paolo.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.314
Being a criminal was how he survived.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.400
[chuckles] But the past is the past.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.654
This project represents
a new chapter for his organization.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.948
So we're playing pretend now.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.866
Okay, I'll play along.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.412
Getting the contract
is just the first step.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.123
If Santoro wants to milk this heifer,

16:38.206 --> 16:41.793
he'll need to make and maintain
the right connections,

16:41.876 --> 16:44.713
line the right pockets, pay out entities.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.880
It's overwhelming.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.551
Lucky for you,
I'm here to offer my assistance.

16:50.427 --> 16:55.473
Mr. Santoro has nothing
but respect for you, Mr. Reddington.

16:56.099 --> 17:00.520
[chuckles softly] But we already have
a full complement of partners

17:00.603 --> 17:02.105
on the project.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.273
Erosion is a sneaky sort.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.277
It happens slowly over time.

17:07.902 --> 17:08.903
Before you know it,

17:08.987 --> 17:12.866
something that once was thriving
no longer exists.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.325
Is that a threat?

17:16.411 --> 17:17.494
Just a tip.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.038
That one's free.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.999
You can see yourself out.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.002
[cellphone dialing]

17:27.088 --> 17:28.423
[line ringing]

17:29.591 --> 17:32.093
Yes, Secretary Kyle's office, please.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.096
Please sit down.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.891
So, how can I help you?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.477
Well, we just pulled a print
from a fraud case we've been working,

17:40.560 --> 17:41.936
and it belongs to one of your parolees.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.440
He was operating
under the alias Okello Okoro.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.192
But his real name is Kel Ammons.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.651
Kel?

17:48.735 --> 17:52.238
[sighs] That's too bad.
I was hoping Kel would turn a corner.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.116
I mean,
he's not the sharpest tool in the shed,

17:55.200 --> 17:57.368
but he's handsome, he's charming.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.287
I thought he might find a way
to cash in on that.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.956
He did, by stealing the dowry
of an African woman.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.082
We need to find him.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.795
I did an apartment check last week.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.048
Nothing out of the ordinary.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.758
That address should be current.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.134
That's a different address

18:13.218 --> 18:14.886
than the apartment
he's sharing with his wife.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.971
[Ressler] We'll look into this.
We'll get back to you.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.097
Thanks for your help.

18:25.980 --> 18:26.981
Who were the stiffs?

18:27.065 --> 18:29.984
FBI agents looking into Kel Ammons.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.694
Something about a love scam.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.453
[Reddington] Mr. Secretary, welcome.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.121
Please have a seat.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.415
We haven't caught up for some time.

18:44.499 --> 18:47.877
How are those gray wolves of yours doing?

18:47.961 --> 18:49.587
[Kyle] You want to hear something great?

18:49.671 --> 18:53.883
Their population grew by 3.5%
over the last 12 months alone.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.553
And, hey, we even spotted a new den.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.179
It's near Glacier National Park.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.557
That's what I love about you, Eddie.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.184
You truly care about the puppies.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.228
Puts a smile on my face.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.313
It also gave
the Department of the Interior

19:07.397 --> 19:10.024
a win to take back to the President.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.236
But we're not here to talk
about wolves, now, are we?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.571
We are not.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.197
I've run into some trouble

19:16.281 --> 19:20.034
with a coastal protection project
in Florida.

19:20.118 --> 19:24.497
The contract is about to go
to a new erosion control company.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.875
What you don't know
is that the company is backed

19:26.958 --> 19:30.879
by a Brazilian entrepreneur
named Adolfo Santoro,

19:30.962 --> 19:34.340
who also has ties
with certain crime syndicates.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.592
No biggie,

19:35.675 --> 19:39.512
but they include
one particularly ghastly drug cartel

19:39.596 --> 19:41.848
that's been terrorizing the Yucatán.

19:41.931 --> 19:46.060
It's a sensitive matter
that only you can help me with.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.856
How long do you need?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.150
Long enough for you and I
to push a few pieces

19:52.233 --> 19:54.319
around the game board.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.990
-You screwed up.
-[Kel] No, I didn't.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.200
Duni has no idea who I am.

20:01.284 --> 20:04.746
I scrubbed the apartment like I always do,
and I closed the bank account.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.830
It was seamless.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.832
Well, you must have screwed up somewhere.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.500
The FBI knows your real identity.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.044
The FBI?

20:11.127 --> 20:13.588
Yeah, they were just here
questioning my boss.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.424
You're burned, and now we're both at risk.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.218
Jemma, what do I do?
I can't go back to jail.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.220
First, you go to your apartment.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.348
Get rid of anything
that connects you to me.

20:23.431 --> 20:27.101
And then you need to disappear,
somewhere no one knows who you are.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.186
Go now.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.024
Hey, I'll be back soon.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.776
I need to run a personal errand.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.110
I'll be on my cell, yeah?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.951
Ugh. It's astonishing
how much work and preparation

20:43.034 --> 20:45.036
went into this terrible con.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.871
Well, imagine
what they could have accomplished

20:46.955 --> 20:49.374
if they just applied themselves
to something constructive.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.836
Wait. Isn't that our guy?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.715
Kel Ammons. FBI.
Keep your hands where I can see them.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.051
[suspenseful music playing]

21:21.948 --> 21:23.616
Kel Ammons, you're under arrest.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.628
[cellphone rings]

21:35.712 --> 21:37.296
Jemma, I'm glad you're calling.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.215
Listen, I want to talk
to you about something.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.800
Yeah, where are you? Are you alone?

21:40.883 --> 21:43.428
Yeah. Mey's at the cafe on the corner,
grabbing us something to eat.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.638
-What's going on?
-We're moving up the timeline.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.223
I need you to withdraw Mey's dowry today.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.183
Actually, that's what I want
to talk to you about.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.476
The FBI is onto us.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.896
One of my husbands got made.
I'm shutting down the operation.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.815
I'm not sure how long. Maybe for good.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.817
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. The Feds?
-Don't worry.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.235
They don't have any idea you exist,

21:59.318 --> 22:01.279
and I'm going to keep it that way,
you have my word.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.865
But for now, I need Mey's dowry
in my account today.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.868
Look, Jemma, I can't do it.
I can't rob Mey.

22:06.951 --> 22:07.952
Why not?

22:08.911 --> 22:09.912
I...

22:11.330 --> 22:12.331
I love her.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.542
Mey did not fall in love with you.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.502
I'm the one who seduced her online. Me.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.671
She fell in love with my words,
my passion.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.548
What are you going to do
when she figures out

22:20.631 --> 22:22.008
you have nothing meaningful to say?

22:22.091 --> 22:23.676
Look, I'm not stealing her money.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.887
More than half of that dowry
belongs to me,

22:25.970 --> 22:27.263
and it may be my last one.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.390
There's no way in hell I'm giving that up.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.059
Jemma, don't call again.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.518
-Don't you...
-[line disconnects]

22:32.602 --> 22:33.644
Ugh.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.734
-Thanks.
-Bye-bye.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.949
Excuse me. Are you Mey Chen?

22:47.658 --> 22:50.036
I am. I'm sorry. Do I know you?

22:50.119 --> 22:53.623
No, but I-I just witnessed
a terrible accident on Dale and Fifth.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.833
A pedestrian was hit by a motorcycle.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.294
He said his name was Aang, Aang Chen.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.004
-Do you know him?
-He's my husband.

23:00.755 --> 23:03.800
Well, uh, he was pretty banged up.
I don't know how badly,

23:03.883 --> 23:05.718
but when the paramedics
put him in the ambulance,

23:05.802 --> 23:06.803
he asked me to come find you.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.139
He said that he didn't have his phone
and that you were new to the country.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.933
You'd have no way
of getting a hold of him.

23:12.767 --> 23:13.768
Thank you.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.314
Wait, uh, what hospital was he taken to?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.941
Uh, Overbrook General.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.234
You know where that is?

23:21.317 --> 23:23.111
I don't know where anything is yet.

23:23.945 --> 23:26.739
Well, I could drop you off.
The hospital's right on my way.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.241
-It'd be no problem.
-Thank you.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.742
Yes. I really appreciate it.

23:29.826 --> 23:30.827
[Jemma] Okay.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.794
[Siya] You staying out of trouble?

23:39.877 --> 23:42.296
For the moment,
but things could take a turn.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.549
The day's not over. How about you?

23:44.632 --> 23:48.427
I've got a lead on my mother's
former case officer with the CIA.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.304
-Wonderful.
-Not wonderful.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.766
The woman's retired
in St. Augustine, Florida.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.853
I left her a voicemail,
but I think I'm gonna have to wait

23:56.936 --> 24:00.189
until I can take some personal time
to fly down there.

24:00.273 --> 24:04.610
Nonsense. I'll take you there
first thing tomorrow on the jet.

24:04.694 --> 24:06.028
Really?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.697
Are you planning to fly tomorrow?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.575
I'm planning to fly you
to St. Augustine tomorrow.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.703
Oldest city in America.
I've never been. I'd love to go.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.168
[line ringing]

24:20.251 --> 24:22.336
-[Jemma] Hello?
-Mey!

24:22.420 --> 24:23.963
Why haven't you been picking up?

24:24.046 --> 24:25.965
I've been calling for the past hour.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.216
Where are you? You okay?

24:27.300 --> 24:30.094
I'm afraid Mey's unable
to come to the phone at the moment.

24:30.178 --> 24:32.555
Jemma. What did you do?

24:32.638 --> 24:34.432
If you hurt Mey, I swear that I'm gonna--

24:34.515 --> 24:36.684
Before you swear to anything
you might regret,

24:36.767 --> 24:39.687
I want you to understand
that I am the one in control.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.607
And if you don't bring me Mey's dowry
in the next 24 hours,

24:42.690 --> 24:44.483
you will never see your wife again.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.867
[cellphone ringing]

24:52.950 --> 24:54.076
Sorry.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.164
Hello.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.541
Mr. Reddington, this is Tomas Vicente.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.419
I just learned
of an interesting development

25:03.502 --> 25:05.630
in the Gulf coastline bid.

25:05.713 --> 25:10.134
Florida's Regional Environmental Officer
has just resigned,

25:10.218 --> 25:11.802
completely out of the blue.

25:11.886 --> 25:15.723
And Mr. Santoro's government
contract is now delayed.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.600
I'm confused. Why are you calling me?

25:17.683 --> 25:19.810
I already offered my help
and you declined.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.312
Please.

25:21.395 --> 25:25.858
Mr. Santoro would very much
like a face-to-face.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.402
Can you get to Cuba in six hours?

25:29.320 --> 25:31.781
Maybe. Text me the address and I'll see.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.159
I'm afraid we have a detour.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.119
Detour? Detour to where?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.038
To Cuba. Have you been?

25:39.121 --> 25:40.539
What about St. Augustine?

25:40.623 --> 25:42.041
Don't you worry one bit.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.961
We will definitely get you there, too.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.128
What a whirlwind.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.758
How was your first night back in a cell?

25:50.841 --> 25:52.134
You ready to talk now?

25:54.929 --> 25:55.930
[sighs]

25:57.139 --> 25:58.474
It was Jemma Parikh.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.892
Who's Jemma Parikh?

25:59.976 --> 26:01.477
She works in my parole office.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.312
The woman with the coffee.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.647
[Kel] That's where we met.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.733
Jemma noticed
how I was struggling to find a job.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.612
She promised the con would be
a good way to make a living.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.283
-She was right.
-So Parikh runs the operation?

26:15.366 --> 26:16.993
She's the one you're looking for.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.494
How's her operation work?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.954
Jemma looks for...

26:20.997 --> 26:24.000
I don't know.
Good-looking ex-cons, I guess. [chuckles]

26:26.711 --> 26:28.004
Ethnic types.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.714
She creates an ID for them

26:29.797 --> 26:31.924
and then uses their profiles
to phish online.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.218
That's where she finds her marks.

26:34.302 --> 26:37.263
From countries
where families still pay dowries.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.557
I take it Duni wasn't your first victim.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.891
That's right.

26:40.975 --> 26:42.935
Once Jemma got a woman on the hook,

26:43.019 --> 26:45.688
she'd coach me
on whatever I needed to know.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.607
Then I'd swoop in and do what I do best.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.401
Don't flatter yourself, Romeo.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.070
[Dembe] So you split
the dowries with Parikh?

26:53.154 --> 26:56.657
She took 70%, but she keeps me working.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.909
Well, how many husbands
does she have working?

26:58.993 --> 27:00.619
I don't know.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.164
Jemma's a pro.
She... She keeps us all separate.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.958
What about the brides?
The other women she's still conning?

27:06.042 --> 27:07.043
We need their names.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.711
I don't have any.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.339
-It looks like we're done here.
-[Kel] Wait! Please don't go.

27:11.422 --> 27:12.631
I want to help you!

27:12.715 --> 27:15.760
I-I just can't tell you what I don't know!

27:15.843 --> 27:19.096
Jemma Parikh, born in Ahmedabad, India.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.223
She emigrated to America in her 20s.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.976
Currently, Parikh works
as a local office manager

27:24.060 --> 27:25.561
for the US Parole Commission.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.230
I called her boss,
but she ditched work this afternoon.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.066
Nobody's heard from her since.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.151
Because she knows we're on to her.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.654
I searched the state of Maryland's
police records

27:35.738 --> 27:37.073
and found 12 foreign brides

27:37.156 --> 27:39.950
who reported their husbands missing
in the last five years.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.827
All of those cases are still active.

27:41.911 --> 27:44.330
It's a smart con.
Without proof of foul play,

27:44.413 --> 27:46.540
missing persons cases
aren't a high priority.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.876
Even less so when it involves immigrants.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.461
They're a priority now.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.214
This is no longer
a case about one woman's stolen dowry.

27:53.297 --> 27:57.343
I suspect Parikh has been running
an international fraud ring for years.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.428
We need to find Parikh
before she skips town.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.513
Do we have any leads?

28:01.055 --> 28:03.432
I do. I looked into Parikh's
offshore account

28:03.516 --> 28:05.518
where Duni's husband
transferred his dowry.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.645
I traced monthly payments
from that account

28:07.728 --> 28:09.522
to a leased sedan here in DC.

28:09.605 --> 28:13.067
It's a BMW registered under
the same false ID on the bank account.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.360
Contact the manufacturer.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.321
Let's see if we can get
a GPS location on that vehicle.

28:17.405 --> 28:18.406
I already did.

28:18.489 --> 28:22.243
BMW is currently in a parking lot
outside of a bank on Hamilton and 13th.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.453
Agents Ressler and Zuma, get there now.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.205
Let's end this once and for all.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.838
FBI. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.714
Please, you can't arrest me.
She'll kill her.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.092
Who are you talking about?
Who's gonna kill who?

28:38.175 --> 28:40.386
Jemma Parikh. The woman I work for.

28:40.469 --> 28:43.889
If I don't get Jemma this money today,
she's going to kill my wife.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.855
[suspenseful music playing]

28:58.279 --> 29:01.365
Siya, I'm not exactly sure
how this is going to go.

29:05.035 --> 29:08.330
Would you be a dear
and stand by me and look tough?

29:09.623 --> 29:11.459
How tough we talking?

29:11.542 --> 29:15.254
Like you shot a man in Reno
just to watch him die.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.677
I always hoped we would meet,
just not under these circumstances.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.766
I made promises to my friends
in the States

29:27.850 --> 29:31.103
that I won't be able to keep now
because of you.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.356
[chuckles] I learned the hard way
to avoid promises.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.942
Stick to probabilities, likelihoods.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.737
You'll find the collateral damage
is much less.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.906
You screwed me over in Florida.

29:41.989 --> 29:47.077
No, I leaned into resources
that I told your associate about.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.871
Nothing more, nothing less.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.001
You, on the other hand,
decided to play in my sandbox

29:54.084 --> 29:56.712
without inviting me
to make castles with you.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.924
You have my attention now.

30:00.007 --> 30:04.553
I'm reminded of a time
at the Hipódromo Independencia in Rosario.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.347
There was a young colt,

30:06.430 --> 30:10.267
perfectly bred, aggressive, energetic.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.937
Everyone knew he was a sure thing.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.273
I'm embarrassed to say
I bought into the hype

30:16.357 --> 30:18.359
and bet a whole lot of money on him,

30:18.442 --> 30:20.319
and he lost

30:20.402 --> 30:22.780
to a horse who had seen better days

30:23.572 --> 30:26.367
but had the heart and soul of a winner.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.370
And that night
he made sure everyone knew it.

30:30.287 --> 30:32.206
I'm giving you one last chance

30:32.289 --> 30:34.500
to accept the offer of my services.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.962
I'm not alone on the Florida project.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.882
I have partners, and before I can
sign off on anything,

30:41.966 --> 30:44.802
I need to reach out
and consult with them first.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.263
I have a few minutes. I'll wait.

30:58.023 --> 31:01.110
Would you be so kind
as to give us a minute, Siya?

31:01.193 --> 31:02.361
I'll see myself out.

31:09.785 --> 31:10.995
You look the same.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.122
You too.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.710
I wish you had come back.

31:19.128 --> 31:20.838
I've been busy with work.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.466
I'm not surprised, what with you
being such a tough guy and all.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.303
But I'm getting too old
to search the jungle for you.

31:28.971 --> 31:32.725
You're saying Santoro
caught your attention.

31:32.808 --> 31:36.478
But I know you don't care about him

31:36.562 --> 31:37.813
or his business.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.692
That's not why you're here, is it?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.403
I missed you.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.364
Miss you.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.503
I miss you, too.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.008
But I gotta get back to work.

32:11.347 --> 32:12.890
My partners agreed.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.309
They look forward to working with you.

32:15.392 --> 32:16.393
Excellent news.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.106
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere else to be.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.613
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me, Miss Saint.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.448
Oh, please, call me Regina.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.326
Meera Malik's daughter. My goodness.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.621
I never expected to see you again.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.373
Wait. Uh, we've met before?

32:37.456 --> 32:39.375
I-I'm sorry. I don't remember.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.086
Oh, of course you don't.
You were still in a crib, dear.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.214
And now you work for the FBI.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.174
Following in your mother's footsteps?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.176
Something like that.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.969
I didn't work with Meera long.

32:51.053 --> 32:52.513
Just the one case.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.516
But I considered her a friend.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.726
I was sorry to hear of her passing.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.564
Well, I'm here because of
the case you just mentioned.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.401
I was hoping
you could tell me more about it.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.653
I remember it well.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.322
You always do when you lose an agent,

33:10.406 --> 33:12.282
even one working for a different team.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.410
Nigel Sutton.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.871
Yes. Your mother's partner.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.040
What happened?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.711
There's only so much
I'm authorized to say.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.215
Most of the information
surrounding that case is still classified.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.719
What I can tell you is an inquiry
into cause of death was opened,

33:32.553 --> 33:36.181
but your mother
bore no responsibility in Nigel's death.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.976
He simply died in the line of duty.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.521
There was an inquiry?

33:42.604 --> 33:44.314
Inquiries are protocol.

33:44.398 --> 33:47.735
But Nigel was just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.280
In fact, Meera took it the hardest.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.531
They were close, you know,

33:52.614 --> 33:55.451
ever since that first case
they worked together in Kolkata.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.746
I didn't know any of this.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.123
There's a lot I'm still learning
about my mother.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.335
Hello?

34:06.003 --> 34:07.296
I'm here.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.380
I have your money.

34:09.465 --> 34:12.259
[Jemma] Ah, I'm glad
you came to your senses.

34:12.342 --> 34:13.342
The money, please.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.053
Not until I know Mey is unharmed.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.896
Mey. Thank God you're not hurt.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.647
Don't even think about it.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.650
If Mey loves you like you believe,

34:29.735 --> 34:31.487
then she'll forgive you.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.864
A happy ending will be waiting
on the other side.

34:34.697 --> 34:35.908
The money, now.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.213
[crying]

34:49.295 --> 34:51.380
Hey, don't worry. You're safe now.

34:51.465 --> 34:52.882
I got you.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.134
[agent] FBI!

34:54.217 --> 34:56.303
Show me your hands!

34:56.386 --> 34:57.638
Turn around.

34:58.806 --> 34:59.807
All right, move in.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.811
Jemma Parikh, you're under arrest.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.282
[Dembe] We ran your background.

35:17.366 --> 35:18.700
Do you know what we found?

35:19.910 --> 35:22.246
A criminal complaint
you filed in your 20s,

35:23.330 --> 35:27.125
after you arrived in the States from India
to marry an American.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.672
But he disappeared
after your parents paid the dowry.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.717
In my country,

35:35.801 --> 35:37.886
I'm what's called a nowhere bride.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.597
So you were a victim
and now you are victimizing other women.

35:40.681 --> 35:42.140
How does that happen?

35:42.224 --> 35:45.102
When my husband vanished, I had nothing.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.645
I tried to go back home,

35:46.728 --> 35:49.523
but my family was too ashamed
to take me back.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.485
I was heartbroken
and on my own in a foreign land.

35:53.569 --> 35:56.280
So it was done to you,
so you thought, why not do it to others?

35:56.363 --> 35:58.699
This is the land of opportunity.
Haven't you heard?

35:59.283 --> 36:01.743
Sounds like a convenient way
to justify robbery.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.120
No, no, you are wrong.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.038
I steal dowries.

36:05.873 --> 36:08.584
They're antiquated. They are patriarchal.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.879
They maintain gender inequality,
prevent women from going to school,

36:11.962 --> 36:14.423
and keep them from economic independence.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.843
Not to mention the violence
that surrounds them.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.011
You're right.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.804
Dowries are dehumanizing.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.307
But you could have
really helped those brides.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.809
Instead, you preyed on them.

36:25.893 --> 36:26.977
At the end of the day,

36:27.060 --> 36:29.771
you're no better
than a run-of-the-mill thief.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.982
Just like the man who stole from you.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.197
[gate closes]

36:41.158 --> 36:43.994
I did what you asked me to do.
Please, you have to let me see Mey.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.621
Come on. You know that's not possible.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.749
I need to explain everything. I need her
to know I was telling her the truth.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.208
-I really do love her.
-Yeah?

36:50.292 --> 36:52.169
Sure have a funny way of showing it.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.504
[sighs]

37:05.724 --> 37:07.476
Do you think he's telling the truth?

37:09.269 --> 37:10.270
Does it matter?

37:11.980 --> 37:13.607
[crying] I guess not.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.443
He's not the person
I left my home and family for.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.238
What am I going to do in this country now?

37:20.322 --> 37:21.907
He's the only person I...

37:22.991 --> 37:24.910
I thought I knew here.

37:24.993 --> 37:29.456
Well, it just so happens
I know a young woman from Kenya

37:29.539 --> 37:31.833
who I think you might
really hit it off with.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.044
Come on. Let's get out of here.

37:35.796 --> 37:37.130
[Cooper] Parikh kept a ledger,

37:37.214 --> 37:39.299
so we were able to arrest
her ring of conmen

37:39.383 --> 37:41.051
and get some of the stolen dowries back.

37:41.134 --> 37:42.844
The money will be disbursed
to all the women

37:42.928 --> 37:44.513
who were defrauded by her operation.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.181
Thank you.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.809
I would have never known
what really happened without your help.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.896
So, what's next?

37:53.605 --> 37:57.651
I have a lot to think about,
but I want to take some time for myself.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.153
Maybe try a college course.

38:02.823 --> 38:03.824
Thank you again.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.075
You're so welcome.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.124
I don't know if this case
is high-profile enough

38:12.207 --> 38:13.750
to get the DOJ off our backs,

38:13.834 --> 38:15.711
but I'm happy we were able
to help someone.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.213
Me too, honey. Thank you.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.297
[Charlene] Mm.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.596
How was your chat with Regina Saint?

38:26.680 --> 38:28.598
Have you discovered something?

38:28.682 --> 38:33.353
Nigel Sutton and my mother
began working together in Kolkata,

38:33.437 --> 38:37.190
where my birth certificate
and adoption papers were forged.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.902
Less than two years later,

38:40.986 --> 38:43.780
Nigel was killed during an operation,

38:43.864 --> 38:46.033
and Meera was investigated.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.287
There's just too many coincidences
too close together.

38:50.871 --> 38:53.373
I think it's all connected,
but I don't know how.

38:54.374 --> 38:56.752
Not every answer is worth knowing.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.546
To me, this one is. [sighs]

39:00.589 --> 39:01.590
Would you just...

39:04.301 --> 39:07.888
Please, tell me what you know.

39:11.892 --> 39:13.060
Kolkata.

39:13.685 --> 39:18.106
In 1997,
Meera was a young intelligence officer

39:18.190 --> 39:22.861
working in operation
in one of the deepest, darkest holes

39:22.944 --> 39:25.030
that humanity has to offer.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.699
Guns and drugs,

39:27.783 --> 39:29.451
sexual slavery.

39:30.202 --> 39:35.290
One night she met the head
of a trafficking ring in Bowbazar,

39:35.373 --> 39:38.376
a red-light district that's said to employ

39:38.460 --> 39:40.921
almost 12,000 prostitutes.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.882
While Meera was trying to work the asset,

39:43.965 --> 39:48.136
she noticed the crying baby
alone in the corner.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.679
At that moment,

39:49.763 --> 39:54.851
members of a rival gang came in
and the place turned into a free-for-all.

39:54.935 --> 39:57.604
As the chaos ensued around her,

39:57.687 --> 40:02.025
Meera suddenly just scooped up
that baby girl and ran.

40:04.069 --> 40:08.240
She ran all the way to London
and never let go.

40:09.699 --> 40:10.700
Uh...

40:12.244 --> 40:14.913
The parents. Who were my parents?

40:16.498 --> 40:17.749
I don't know.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.709
You had been abandoned.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.550
What about Officer Sutton?
What happened to him?

40:27.217 --> 40:29.469
Before Kolkata, there was no baby.

40:29.553 --> 40:31.471
And afterwards there was you.

40:32.973 --> 40:36.893
Meera had fabricated
your birth and adoption.

40:39.062 --> 40:42.858
And Officer Sutton,
being her close colleague, knew the truth

40:42.941 --> 40:45.402
and tried to use that against your mother,

40:45.485 --> 40:49.322
extorting her and putting you in danger.

40:50.282 --> 40:54.953
Meera wasn't going to let
anything bad happen to her new family.

40:56.872 --> 41:01.126
I know how far a parent will go

41:01.209 --> 41:02.544
to protect their child.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.589
Well, she didn't kill him.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.633
She didn't precipitate or participate.

41:10.010 --> 41:11.094
She let him die.

41:14.848 --> 41:18.018
Meera gave you a chance at life.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.812
And from what I've seen,

41:21.980 --> 41:25.734
your mother would be very proud.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.657
Thank you.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.288
Why don't I get us something to drink?
