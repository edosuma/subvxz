00:06.507 --> 00:08.634
Seven Golden Globes and two Oscars…

00:08.717 --> 00:12.221
Hollywood legend. Please welcome
the one and only Jane Fonda.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.139
…an activist,
cofounder of Women's Media Center.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.974
And fitness guru, Jane Fonda.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.101
Now, her new book
tackles the climate crisis.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.646
One thing that I think is really important

00:20.729 --> 00:25.359
is to be constantly ready
to get out of your comfort zone,

00:25.442 --> 00:27.694
because that's when you learn.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.197
And, boy,
I get out of my comfort zone a lot.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.033
Thank you, Jane.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.870
When I'm afraid of something,
I make it my best friend.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.707
Doing that almost always
leads me to something better.

00:40.791 --> 00:44.002
Explaining the things that I've learned

00:44.086 --> 00:46.171
and why I've done
the things that I've done

00:46.255 --> 00:48.882
to be able to inspire and teach

00:48.966 --> 00:53.053
has brought understanding
to other women about their lives.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.138
- Dear Jane…
- Dear Jane…

00:55.222 --> 00:56.515
Thank you, Jane.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.767
For inspiring me to stand up for myself

00:58.851 --> 01:00.143
and make sure that I'm heard.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.020
It's never too late.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.650
We get braver as we get older.
We get bolder.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.111
I mean, what do we have to lose?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.488
- Dear Jane…
- Dear Jane…

01:11.572 --> 01:12.698
Dear Jane…

01:40.934 --> 01:44.021
I grew up in Los Angeles in the '40s.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.731
It was very different.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.650
It was not yet polluted.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.029
There was no smog then
because there were no freeways.

01:52.112 --> 01:56.033
Clean air. It was just wonderful.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.913
We lived on a hillside
in the Santa Monica mountains

02:00.996 --> 02:05.751
with the Pacific Ocean
laid out in front of me, glistening.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.505
And all these hills
for a young tomboy to roam in,

02:09.588 --> 02:11.173
and that's what I did.

02:13.425 --> 02:17.054
My dad was Henry Fonda,
and he was a movie star.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.683
He did a number of movies.
The Fugitive, My Darling Clementine.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.187
I sure like that name, Clementine.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.856
And others, all in a row.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.276
And every time he'd come home,
he'd always be in a bad mood.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.279
You know, when people ask me,
"Did you always want to be an actor?"

02:34.363 --> 02:35.822
And I say, "No."

02:36.406 --> 02:38.242
My dad never brought joy home.

02:38.325 --> 02:42.579
I never felt that this is a profession
that can provide joy.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.501
My mother was often sick.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.336
She wasn't around too much.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.007
She didn't really know
how to show up as a parent.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.677
We always had nice clothes.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.138
You know, those external kinds of things
were always taken care of.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.975
But there wasn't a lot of parenting.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.061
And so, like a lot of kids,
I raised myself.

03:08.272 --> 03:12.609
From a young age, I didn't know
what I wanted to do with my life.

03:12.693 --> 03:16.321
I just knew that I never ever
wanted to be an actor.

03:16.405 --> 03:20.117
I thought I was too shy,
I was ugly, I was fat.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.954
But then one day,
Susan Strasberg came over.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.832
She was in town because her mother, Paula,

03:26.915 --> 03:30.919
was coaching Marilyn Monroe
in Some Like It Hot.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.630
So Susan would come over,
and we would talk,

03:33.714 --> 03:37.134
and she said,
"Why don't you audition for my father?"

03:37.217 --> 03:41.430
Lee Strasberg, the great acting teacher.
"Be in his classes."

03:41.513 --> 03:44.474
There was The Actors Studio,
but then he had classes.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.562
There were lots of people in them.
It wasn't that hard to get in.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.815
Anyway,
I started with the Lee Strasberg classes.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.985
Two months went by,
and I just sat in the back of the room

03:55.068 --> 03:56.820
next to Marilyn Monroe, by the way.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.490
She was as terrified as I was.
She never did do a scene.

04:01.241 --> 04:06.121
But eventually, Lee said, "I'm gonna
call on you to do sense-memory exercises."

04:06.872 --> 04:09.333
So I did, in front of the audience.

04:10.042 --> 04:13.879
Afterwards, he said, "You know,
I see a lot of people come through here.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.173
You are genuinely talented."

04:19.218 --> 04:23.430
And it was like the top of my head
came off and birds flew out.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.308
Lee Strasberg said I was talented?

04:26.808 --> 04:30.854
From that moment,
I woke up knowing what I wanted to do.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.524
I didn't take one class. I took three.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.817
I worked harder than anybody else,

04:35.901 --> 04:37.444
because I didn't want people to say,

04:37.528 --> 04:40.364
"Oh, she succeeded
'cause she's Henry Fonda's daughter."

04:40.447 --> 04:43.325
It was one of the happiest times
of my life.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.620
Much happier than when I eventually
went to Hollywood and did a movie.

04:49.122 --> 04:53.168
The great Joshua Logan,
a director, a producer,

04:53.669 --> 04:56.505
he had directed all kinds of hits.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.924
He was considered, you know, a big deal.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.302
Well, he put me under contract.

05:03.220 --> 05:07.140
We've had an extraordinary experience,
and you'll be sharing it with us soon.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.228
We've discovered a new star, Jane Fonda.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.357
He gave me the lead role
in my first movie, opposite Tony Perkins.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.943
Basketball players flock to Custer,
don't they?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.946
They're usually tall, aren't they?

05:21.780 --> 05:22.781
There.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.909
Why, of course.
What better reason could a girl have?

05:25.993 --> 05:30.330
It was about a girl that
chose to go to this particular college

05:30.414 --> 05:35.669
because they have a great basketball team,
and she can meet a tall husband.

05:36.503 --> 05:41.717
You know, this is the--
the men's locker room.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.428
It is?

05:44.511 --> 05:49.349
Was the stupidest movie,
the stupidest story.

05:49.433 --> 05:53.687
Warner saw the dailies
and wanted me to wear falsies,

05:53.770 --> 05:58.734
and Joshua Logan said
that I should break my jaw

05:58.817 --> 06:00.777
and have these back teeth pulled…

06:02.070 --> 06:04.740
so that my cheeks would cave in.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.491
And I said, "No way."

06:06.575 --> 06:09.077
It was not a good experience.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.789
But women dealt with
all kinds of things back then.

06:19.963 --> 06:24.968
Up until 1967, I had made about 14 films

06:25.052 --> 06:28.597
and I was married to Roger Vadim.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.060
He was a very, very, very famous
French director who'd been married…

06:33.560 --> 06:37.773
Catherine Deneuve,
Anita Ekberg, Brigitte Bardot.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.817
Those were his women before me.
It was challenging.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.904
And one day, it was 1967,

06:44.655 --> 06:48.867
Dino De Laurentiis sent me a script
to play Barbarella.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.703
It was a very famous
French comic book character,

06:51.787 --> 06:53.830
and I was inclined to say no.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.417
She had to be naked most of the time,
and I'd--

06:57.501 --> 06:58.502
No.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.380
Scared to death.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.091
But Vadim wanted to do it.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.635
All his movies were very sexy.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.763
So this just totally suited him.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.308
So he convinced Dino to let him direct it.

07:17.312 --> 07:22.067
The title sequence in Barbarella
is a space striptease.

07:22.651 --> 07:26.363
We're floating in space.
I take off my astronaut's outfit.

07:26.864 --> 07:31.827
And Vadim promised me that the titles
of the movie would cover everything.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.161
They didn't quite.

07:33.245 --> 07:37.291
My mantra since then has become,
"No is a complete sentence."

07:37.875 --> 07:40.419
But I rarely said no in those days.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.213
And so, I agreed to do it.

07:44.381 --> 07:48.260
Time came to do this title scene.
I got quite drunk.

07:48.343 --> 07:51.513
Vodka, 'cause nobody could smell it.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.724
And then we see the dailies the next day,

07:53.807 --> 07:59.605
and we discover that there has been
a bat flying around across the camera.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.690
And so we have to do it over.

08:01.773 --> 08:05.569
So I had to go through
this horrendous experience

08:05.652 --> 08:08.447
with a hangover on top of it.

08:12.868 --> 08:16.955
Just before Barbarella came out,
I was living in France,

08:17.456 --> 08:23.420
where I met Simone Signoret, who was
one of the biggest female stars in France.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.298
When we became friends,

08:26.381 --> 08:29.927
the American war in Vietnam
started to heat up,

08:30.010 --> 08:32.261
and up until then,

08:32.346 --> 08:37.726
I had not taken a stand
because I was very defensive.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.104
If the United States
was fighting someplace,

08:41.188 --> 08:44.149
it had to be on the right side.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.945
And so, Simone would bring me
to anti-war rallies

08:48.028 --> 08:51.782
that the French were having
against the American war in Vietnam.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.076
She was an anti-war activist then.

08:54.785 --> 09:00.958
I met American soldiers who had been
in Vietnam and were resisters.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.002
They'd left, they'd fled,
and they were in Paris.

09:04.086 --> 09:07.089
It was these soldiers that taught me
about the war.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.425
And then, I just-- I flipped.

09:10.509 --> 09:14.680
I felt so angry. I felt so betrayed.

09:15.889 --> 09:20.978
Within a year, I had left France,
moved back to the United States,

09:21.061 --> 09:24.481
realizing that I knew New York,

09:24.565 --> 09:26.191
I knew Los Angeles.

09:26.275 --> 09:29.319
I had no idea
what this country of mine was.

09:29.403 --> 09:33.949
And so, I spent a lot of time
driving through America.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.993
Small towns, big towns.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.912
And there were these coffeehouses

09:38.996 --> 09:42.624
run by civilian activists
outside military bases,

09:42.708 --> 09:46.295
and I remember the one,
the Oleo Strut in Killeen, Texas,

09:46.378 --> 09:48.213
outside of Fort Hood.

09:48.297 --> 09:51.341
And there were a lot of men
involved in the coffeehouse,

09:51.425 --> 09:56.388
and they would tend to make decisions
without consulting the women.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.681
Twice a week, you know…

09:57.764 --> 10:00.642
But there was a woman who ran it
named Terry Davis,

10:00.726 --> 10:04.146
and she always stood up for the women.

10:04.730 --> 10:08.233
She always fought
for equality and democracy

10:08.317 --> 10:11.445
within the confines of that coffeehouse.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.200
It was revelatory for me.
I was just dumbstruck.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.744
Women defending other women.

10:18.827 --> 10:23.790
Women having each other's back.
And it was very empowering.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.132
Dear Jane,

10:32.216 --> 10:35.469
I live in a small town
in rural Indiana called Marion.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.804
It's the kind of place
where nothing really changes.

10:38.472 --> 10:43.018
It's always business as usual,
but the usual is something from the 1900s.

10:43.685 --> 10:47.397
I've been a fan of yours ever since
I saw 9 to 5 when I was a little kid.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.567
What the hell is going on here?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.736
It was funny. It was empowering.

10:52.819 --> 10:57.074
And even though it didn't resemble
my life in any way, I just loved it.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.576
My family's really conservative,

10:59.660 --> 11:02.496
and I remember one Thanksgiving
when I was 13.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.748
The conversation turned to politics.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.835
People in my family
started saying terrible things

11:07.918 --> 11:10.045
about you and other progressive feminists.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.882
I was just like,
"Wait. What's wrong with Jane Fonda?"

11:13.966 --> 11:17.886
"I'm a naturally inquisitive person,
so I did my research.

11:18.387 --> 11:23.517
I went down a rabbit hole reading about
your acting career and your activism."

11:24.101 --> 11:26.061
I read about the way
you'd fight for what was right,

11:26.144 --> 11:28.313
even though
it might tarnish your reputation.

11:28.397 --> 11:31.400
And I was like, "Oh, my God.
There's nothing wrong with Jane Fonda."

11:31.483 --> 11:35.070
"She's amazing,
and I wanna be her when I grow up."

11:36.238 --> 11:40.742
"Your ballsy attitude, like,
'Nothing is gonna stop me.'

11:40.826 --> 11:42.786
It was so inspiring, I thought."

11:42.870 --> 11:46.331
Why did no one tell me
that there are no rules in life?

11:46.415 --> 11:49.585
I'm a person,
and I have the ability to speak out.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.212
Around the same time,
my friends and I all started noticing

11:52.296 --> 11:55.007
that we felt sick all the time
with the same symptoms.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.968
We had stomach issues
and felt really lethargic.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.887
I realized that I'd been feeling this way

11:59.970 --> 12:02.598
ever since my family moved to Marion
seven years ago.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.058
And I just thought
I always had bad allergies.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.937
But I knew we had a ton
of manufacturing plants, factory farms,

12:09.021 --> 12:11.899
and concentrated animal feeding
operations in the area.

12:11.982 --> 12:16.195
So I started doing research into the
environmental impact of these industries.

12:16.278 --> 12:20.157
I learned that they were all releasing
toxic chemicals into the soil and water.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.993
It couldn't be a coincidence
that so many of us were sick.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.788
I started speaking out
about environmental issues,

12:26.872 --> 12:29.541
and many of my friends
and family members didn't like it.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.879
Some even stopped speaking to me.
My mom was the only exception.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.924
"She always stood by me." A woman.

12:37.841 --> 12:40.677
"And supported me
through everything I do."

12:41.678 --> 12:43.889
I started working with a team
on a get-out-the-vote campaign.

12:43.972 --> 12:48.894
My team reached 4.3 million voters
leading up to the 2020 election.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.313
And now, I volunteer with Greenpeace,

12:51.396 --> 12:54.316
helping their efforts to promote
and implement the THRIVE Agenda,

12:54.399 --> 12:56.777
…a transformative plan
that lays out the foundation

12:56.860 --> 13:00.072
for a just recovery from the climate
crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

13:00.155 --> 13:04.493
"I want to have the same effect
on other girls that you had on me.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.286
Thank you for making me realize

13:06.370 --> 13:08.872
I don't deserve
to have fewer opportunities

13:08.956 --> 13:10.749
just because I'm a woman."

13:15.629 --> 13:17.339
I'd been all over the country.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.426
I'd been arrested on military bases.
I'd been working with soldiers.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.596
I was deeply involved
in the anti-war movement,

13:24.680 --> 13:28.559
and frankly, I wasn't giving
a fuzzy rat's ass about a career.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.310
I wasn't even thinking about it.

13:31.728 --> 13:35.858
I became friends with Ken Cockrel,
a lawyer in Detroit.

13:35.941 --> 13:39.152
And after about a year,
I said to Ken Cockrel,

13:39.236 --> 13:42.823
"I don't wanna act anymore in Hollywood.

13:42.906 --> 13:48.412
It puts too much of a distance between me
and the people that I'm working with now."

13:48.495 --> 13:50.539
And he said, "Sit down.

13:50.622 --> 13:55.002
Fonda, the movement has enough organizers.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.920
We don't have movie stars.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.923
Not only do you have to keep acting,

14:00.007 --> 14:02.551
you have to have much more agency
over your career.

14:02.634 --> 14:03.760
Make it matter."

14:05.721 --> 14:07.848
Well, all right.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.641
So I started thinking,

14:09.725 --> 14:14.188
"I guess I need to start making my own
movies about things that I care about."

14:14.271 --> 14:15.898
Do you look at scripts

14:15.981 --> 14:18.400
and consider possible roles
that you might play

14:18.483 --> 14:21.904
in terms of your political beliefs,
in terms of your political objectives?

14:22.487 --> 14:25.574
Well, I do. I have to make a living,
so there's certain compromises,

14:25.657 --> 14:27.910
but Barbarella I will not do again.

14:29.828 --> 14:34.333
I guess the main criterion I have for
choosing roles is, do they tell the truth?

14:34.833 --> 14:39.963
Klute was my first movie that
challenged me to leave my comfort zone.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.049
And I started to really worry.

14:42.132 --> 14:46.345
Feminism was starting
to permeate my brain.

14:46.428 --> 14:51.016
Would a feminist play that prostitute?

14:52.351 --> 14:55.312
And I said, "I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't do this."

14:55.395 --> 14:58.815
And so I sent the script
to a friend of mine,

14:58.899 --> 15:01.109
a jazz singer named Barbara Dane.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.946
And she read the script,
and she said to me,

15:04.029 --> 15:09.910
"Any time you have the opportunity
to play a fully realized woman,

15:09.993 --> 15:13.121
a multidimensional woman, do it."

15:15.707 --> 15:18.877
There's a scene in the movie
where I'm taken to a morgue

15:18.961 --> 15:22.464
to see if I can identify any of the women
who've been murdered.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.635
And so, in preparation for that,
I asked to go to a real morgue.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.387
And I was shown the files…

15:30.138 --> 15:31.932
and I threw up.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.603
Weeks later,
when we were shooting the last scene,

15:36.687 --> 15:40.524
the john that I'm with
starts to play a tape,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.860
and I suddenly realize this is the killer.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.362
And what happened was,

15:45.445 --> 15:49.491
as I listened, I saw the faces
of those women in the morgue.

15:50.492 --> 15:53.370
All those shots of women who were beaten.

15:54.997 --> 15:59.251
Yellow, blue, swollen, bloody faces.

16:00.752 --> 16:05.674
And I started to cry,
and the crying wasn't for me.

16:06.258 --> 16:12.848
It was for all the women who die
at the hands of enraged men.

16:16.685 --> 16:17.686
Yeah.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.814
The winner is Jane Fonda.

16:22.900 --> 16:29.031
After Klute, all the movies that
I had any control over centered women.

16:29.531 --> 16:33.327
Women who were going through changes,

16:33.410 --> 16:36.330
like aging, which is On Golden Pond.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.917
Or women office workers gaining agency,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.879
and that was 9 to 5,
and just women-centered movies.

16:43.962 --> 16:47.424
And I knew that this new thing,
this feminism,

16:47.508 --> 16:49.593
was gonna make me a better actor.

16:54.806 --> 16:58.018
I was married by now to Tom Hayden.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.646
He was a major figure in the movement.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.690
He cowrote the Port Huron Statement.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.693
He was cofounder
of Students for a Democratic Society

17:06.777 --> 17:11.906
and was trying to decide
how to support a new organization

17:11.990 --> 17:14.660
called the Campaign
for Economic Democracy.

17:15.536 --> 17:19.705
I told Tom, I said, "We have to
start a business to raise money,

17:20.332 --> 17:21.791
but what business?"

17:23.544 --> 17:29.174
So I had been taking this workout class
by a woman named Leni Cazden.

17:29.258 --> 17:31.969
I had never done anything like it
in my life.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.595
It was an hour and a half.

17:33.679 --> 17:38.267
I couldn't move afterwards,
and I became utterly addicted.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.936
Leni Cazden taught me the workout.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.480
It became the Jane Fonda workout.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.067
I started teaching classes,

17:47.150 --> 17:52.072
and women would come from miles away
to take this class.

17:52.155 --> 17:56.326
And I got to know these women,
and they would say to me,

17:56.410 --> 18:00.330
"I'm diabetic, and I've been able
to stop taking insulin."

18:00.414 --> 18:04.918
Another woman would say, "I don't have to
take sleeping pills anymore."

18:05.002 --> 18:08.964
And I realized
this wasn't just about raising money,

18:09.047 --> 18:11.508
this was changing women's lives.

18:12.009 --> 18:15.596
When something touches me
and I think it's important,

18:15.679 --> 18:19.183
I go full bore. Two hundred percent.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.559
This is the advanced workout.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.770
Stand with your feet a little more
than hip-distance apart. Stomach flat…

18:23.854 --> 18:25.230
We made a video,

18:25.314 --> 18:29.443
and it became the number one
best-selling home video of all time.

18:29.943 --> 18:35.282
People would be playing cassettes of the
workout in Honduras and in South Africa.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.992
It became a social event.

18:37.075 --> 18:41.955
Women would get together in their backyard
or their living room and do Jane.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.797
Dear Jane,

18:50.881 --> 18:53.300
Both my parents migrated
to the United States

18:53.383 --> 18:56.345
in the '70s from India for a better life.

18:56.428 --> 18:59.181
Even though I was born and raised
in the United States,

18:59.264 --> 19:02.476
I never felt a lack
of my own Indian culture.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.855
When I was little, my family and I
would go to these parties once a month

19:06.939 --> 19:08.982
where all the kids, the aunties and uncles

19:09.066 --> 19:11.193
would get together at someone's house.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.362
I remember being at this one party,

19:13.445 --> 19:18.200
one auntie had totally gotten super buff
and was looking so good.

19:18.283 --> 19:22.162
And everyone was like, "Wow, Auntie,
tell us what you've been doing."

19:22.246 --> 19:26.041
Jane, one of the things that she was doing
was your workout videos.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.002
And that made everyone else
wanna do it too.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.214
- Are you ready to do the workout?
- Yeah!

19:32.297 --> 19:36.426
From that moment on,
my mom and all of her friends were hooked.

19:36.510 --> 19:40.848
I remember watching my mom
do your workout videos in our living room.

19:40.931 --> 19:44.434
"And sometimes her friends would
get together and do it as a group.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.104
I got really into fitness myself."

19:47.187 --> 19:50.691
I started teaching step aerobics,
kickboxing classes,

19:50.774 --> 19:52.985
cardio classes after school for fun.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.196
But I never thought of fitness
as a viable career path.

19:56.905 --> 19:59.241
This idea was brewing in my head.

19:59.324 --> 20:03.245
There had to be a way for me
to combine my passion for fitness

20:03.328 --> 20:06.331
with something that would honor
my Indian heritage.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.292
That's when it hit me.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.961
I needed to create
an Indian dance workout.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.880
I thought back to your workout videos.

20:12.963 --> 20:16.842
"The Jane Fonda workout
wasn't just exercise.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.761
See, you created
these communities of women

20:19.845 --> 20:23.223
that would get together and get healthy
without judgment."

20:24.391 --> 20:26.226
"That's pretty powerful."

20:26.310 --> 20:28.645
I took elements of a folk dance, Bhangra,

20:28.729 --> 20:33.734
combined it with the essence of Bollywood,
to create the first Indian dance workout.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.111
"And then I took another cue from you.

20:36.195 --> 20:39.740
I decided to make my own workout video."

20:39.823 --> 20:42.826
I did all of my homework,
hired a production company,

20:42.910 --> 20:47.206
shot my first workout video,
and Masala Bhangra was born.

20:50.209 --> 20:55.297
Before I knew it, people from all kinds
of backgrounds were doing Masala Bhangra.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.759
I remember after one class I taught,
someone said to me,

20:58.842 --> 21:02.888
"You're like the Indian Jane Fonda."
I was so flattered.

21:03.472 --> 21:07.643
Today, Masala Bhangra has been
going strong for 21 years.

21:07.726 --> 21:11.271
I've put out 15 workout videos
and have instructors teaching

21:11.355 --> 21:13.774
in 12 different countries
all around the world.

21:13.857 --> 21:17.277
"Thank you, Jane,
for inspiring me to follow my passion

21:17.361 --> 21:20.739
and get the world up and moving,
Indian-style.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.533
I hope I've made you proud."

21:25.410 --> 21:26.620
Makes me happy.

21:32.626 --> 21:38.090
When I turned 59, I had spent a day
on a ranch rounding up bison.

21:38.173 --> 21:41.093
There's not a lot of living Americans
who can say that.

21:41.677 --> 21:45.055
I was on my way back to headquarters
with a bunch of cowboys,

21:45.138 --> 21:49.852
and it hit me. "Wow,
a year from tomorrow I'm gonna be 60."

21:51.353 --> 21:53.605
First 30 years, first act.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.066
Second 30 years, second act.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.193
It's gonna be
the beginning of my third act.

21:58.277 --> 22:00.195
My last 30 years.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.155
Third acts are important, you know.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.908
Anybody that's been to see a play knows,

22:04.992 --> 22:07.077
you know, it can pull everything together.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.163
It's a last act.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.666
I don't know-- What am I supposed to do?

22:13.750 --> 22:19.590
Watching my father in his last days,
I knew that I wasn't afraid of dying.

22:19.673 --> 22:24.887
I was afraid to get to the end,
as he was, with regrets.

22:24.970 --> 22:27.598
When it was too late
to do anything about it.

22:27.681 --> 22:30.767
And the regrets are always
what you didn't do.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.479
So I needed to figure out
what the regrets are

22:34.563 --> 22:38.150
because to know where you're going,
you have to know where you've been.

22:38.650 --> 22:42.613
So I decided that
I was gonna devote the 59th year

22:42.696 --> 22:46.200
to figuring out where I'd been.

22:49.411 --> 22:53.081
I spent a year researching myself.
There's a lot of material.

22:53.165 --> 22:57.586
There's 23,000 pages of FBI files,
in case I forgot.

22:58.295 --> 23:02.382
And so, a year went by of research
and when I got to the end,

23:02.466 --> 23:05.969
I discovered that
the happiest times of my life

23:06.053 --> 23:11.808
come from standing up for other people,
especially women.

23:12.601 --> 23:17.231
Whether it was going to Alcatraz
when it was occupied by Native Americans,

23:17.314 --> 23:21.818
supporting their efforts,
or marching with the Black Panthers.

23:21.902 --> 23:25.489
There were always strong women
passing things on.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.117
And that was the catalyst.

23:29.201 --> 23:32.829
It allowed me to know
what I wanted to do with my third act.

23:33.413 --> 23:37.668
I wanted to inspire and teach
other girls and women.

23:38.168 --> 23:41.672
I can't make my life longer,
but I can make it deeper.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.842
And that's what I'm gonna try to do
in my third act.

23:51.849 --> 23:55.060
Dear Jane,
I'm a committed and dynamic woman.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.896
A storyteller from
South Central Los Angeles.

23:57.980 --> 24:01.066
I like to say that life is a game.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.444
Every day I'm out there
playing with everything I've got.

24:04.528 --> 24:06.446
And having fun while doing it.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.284
"But there was a time in my life
when I felt differently.

24:10.868 --> 24:12.578
In 2007…"

24:12.661 --> 24:16.373
My husband and I were shattered
when the unthinkable happened.

24:17.374 --> 24:19.751
Our daughter died by suicide.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.838
I fell into a deep depression.

24:23.630 --> 24:28.051
I could barely function,
professionally or otherwise.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.679
I ended up losing my job, my car,

24:31.263 --> 24:34.016
and eventually, we even lost our home.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.142
God.

24:36.185 --> 24:39.021
"It took me two years to recuperate…"

24:39.521 --> 24:42.941
But I slowly began reentering the world.

24:43.859 --> 24:48.572
I took a job I was overqualified for
because it was a job.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.115
But one day at work,

24:50.199 --> 24:54.453
I noticed that my coworkers
were always coming to me for advice,

24:54.536 --> 24:57.039
and I always found a way to motivate them.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.958
And I started thinking about
how I could turn these skills of mine

25:00.042 --> 25:01.877
into an opportunity.

25:01.960 --> 25:06.006
In 2012, I took off my training wheels.

25:06.089 --> 25:09.927
I started a life coaching company
called Yes Coaching,

25:10.010 --> 25:13.263
but starting a new business at my age
was overwhelming.

25:14.223 --> 25:16.433
"I didn't know how to speak millennial."

25:17.100 --> 25:19.853
I was in my mid-50s, and I kept wondering,

25:19.937 --> 25:21.522
"Am I too old to do this?"

25:22.314 --> 25:24.399
Then I faced another tragedy.

25:25.025 --> 25:28.862
My husband of 26 years
suddenly passed away.

25:29.613 --> 25:33.283
It started to seem easier
to just give up and retire.

25:34.201 --> 25:38.372
But one day, just before my 60th birthday,

25:38.455 --> 25:41.875
a friend said to me, "You should check out
Jane Fonda's TED Talk."

25:41.959 --> 25:45.003
When I heard you talking
about life's third act,

25:45.087 --> 25:47.464
it was like a buoy in the ocean.

25:47.548 --> 25:53.136
We are living on average today 34 years
longer than our great-grandparents did.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.221
Think about that.

25:54.304 --> 25:59.351
That's an entire second adult lifetime
that's been added to our life span.

25:59.434 --> 26:02.938
I realized I can choose
what I want my third act to be.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.733
I wanted to bring my story
to a powerful conclusion,

26:06.817 --> 26:10.320
where I took charge of resolving
everything that had happened in the movie

26:10.404 --> 26:11.613
up until now.

26:12.197 --> 26:15.826
The first thing I did was
send your TED Talk to my mother.

26:16.869 --> 26:19.413
My mom used to be so active.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.999
But at 82, she spent most of her days…

26:22.082 --> 26:25.294
"…sitting on my sister's couch,
watching TV."

26:25.377 --> 26:29.423
Jane, your TED Talk lit a fire
under her too.

26:30.007 --> 26:34.303
She started volunteering in the community
center and hospital in her neighborhood.

26:34.803 --> 26:39.516
It moved me to tears
to see this transformation in my mom.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.979
"I brought the concept
of the third act to my clients…"

26:44.062 --> 26:46.106
…and you inspired me

26:46.190 --> 26:51.904
to write a book called Say Yes!
Seven Steps to the Life of Your Dreams

26:51.987 --> 26:55.240
that posits that you can have
anything you want in life.

26:55.324 --> 26:58.911
I feel like I'm a conduit
for your message to the masses.

26:58.994 --> 27:02.539
"This is not
some boring conclusion to your life.

27:02.623 --> 27:04.249
It's a resolution."

27:04.833 --> 27:07.377
Thank you, Jane, for reminding me

27:08.170 --> 27:12.966
that as long as you're still breathing
and you have a contribution to the world,

27:13.050 --> 27:14.801
it's never too late.

27:15.844 --> 27:16.845
Wow.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.016
- What do we want?
- Climate justice!

27:21.099 --> 27:23.018
- When do we want it?
- Now!

27:23.101 --> 27:24.102
What do we want?

27:24.186 --> 27:30.234
In 2019, there was
the largest global uprising in history.

27:30.317 --> 27:34.112
Students, the young people,
were standing up for the planet.

27:34.196 --> 27:39.326
And if our parents won't speak up for us,
then we will.

27:40.494 --> 27:43.247
It had a huge impact on me.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.706
Climate justice now!

27:44.790 --> 27:48.502
They are fighting
to have a livable future.

27:48.585 --> 27:53.048
This is a catastrophe that's coming.
And people aren't paying attention.

27:53.924 --> 27:57.594
So I decided that I was gonna
heed the call, if you will.

27:57.678 --> 27:59.555
I was gonna start a protest.

27:59.638 --> 28:03.100
And that was when we decided Fridays.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.644
We'll do it on Fridays,
the way the students are doing,

28:05.727 --> 28:06.979
if we can get their buy-in.

28:08.146 --> 28:11.233
And that was the start
of Fire Drill Fridays.

28:12.776 --> 28:16.738
There are 25 million Americans
who are alarmed about the climate crisis

28:16.822 --> 28:20.117
but haven't done anything
because nobody's asked.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.744
I call them the great unasked.

28:23.245 --> 28:24.788
I was gonna ask them.

28:24.872 --> 28:27.165
I don't know whether
anybody's gonna get arrested.

28:27.249 --> 28:30.210
I don't know about civil disobedience,
but let me tell you something,

28:30.294 --> 28:33.630
civil disobedience
has to become the new normal.

28:37.426 --> 28:42.306
Historically,
civil disobedience has changed history.

28:42.389 --> 28:46.476
Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Gandhi.

28:47.394 --> 28:52.900
Civil disobedience comes after you've
marched and protested and lobbied and--

28:52.983 --> 28:56.111
and written and pleaded,
and you're not listened to.

28:56.195 --> 28:58.197
Then you try civil disobedience.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.991
You need to take a stand.
Take a stand now.

29:03.827 --> 29:07.289
This is a real crisis
that threatens humankind.

29:07.372 --> 29:11.210
And I want to be able to look my grandson,

29:11.293 --> 29:13.003
who's not yet two, in the eye

29:13.086 --> 29:16.340
when he gets older and say to him,
"I did all I could."

29:16.423 --> 29:18.300
- …want?
- Climate justice!

29:18.383 --> 29:20.761
It's also just leading by example.

29:21.762 --> 29:27.184
The fact that I turned 82 in detention
for committing civil disobedience,

29:27.768 --> 29:29.937
maybe there are people who say,

29:30.020 --> 29:35.442
"Well, my God, if she can do it at 82,
maybe I can make a difference," you know?

29:41.949 --> 29:43.575
Dear Jane,

29:43.659 --> 29:47.663
I've been a full-time activist
for eight years here in Philadelphia.

29:48.247 --> 29:51.416
I have a very strong belief
that elders need to get out there

29:51.500 --> 29:54.211
and work for a better world
for all of our children,

29:54.294 --> 29:57.589
our grandchildren and future generations.

29:57.673 --> 29:59.925
- What do we want?
- Climate justice!

30:00.008 --> 30:04.346
Jane, you're ten years my senior,
but I feel like I've grown up with you.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.266
When I was in college,
I was inspired by your fierceness

30:07.349 --> 30:09.393
and your commitment to activism.

30:09.977 --> 30:13.188
When I saw you were organizing
an event around the climate crisis,

30:13.272 --> 30:14.439
I was excited.

30:15.023 --> 30:18.151
My husband and I drove down
to D.C. for the day.

30:18.235 --> 30:22.906
We heard you speak and then you led us
on a march behind the Capitol Building.

30:22.990 --> 30:27.953
When I saw you as an elder leading
that march with so much authority…

30:28.036 --> 30:30.914
"…you put a face on our activism.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.877
Not a face of anger…"

30:34.960 --> 30:37.212
But the face of determination.

30:37.296 --> 30:40.090
You led us into the street
where we blocked traffic.

30:40.174 --> 30:43.302
The police told us,
"If you stand here, we'll arrest you."

30:43.385 --> 30:45.762
And you and I were put
in the same police wagon

30:45.846 --> 30:49.391
and driven to a warehouse
that served as a holding center.

30:50.642 --> 30:53.645
There were 22 women
who got arrested that day.

30:53.729 --> 30:56.356
We were women of all ages
from different backgrounds.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.984
"But with one shared purpose.

30:59.610 --> 31:02.988
We sat around in that holding room
and just chatted for hours

31:03.071 --> 31:05.032
about the importance of climate activism."

31:05.824 --> 31:07.993
I remember how exhausted you were.

31:08.076 --> 31:10.787
Yet you were so interested
in everybody's story

31:10.871 --> 31:13.248
and why they came to Fire Drill Friday.

31:13.749 --> 31:18.253
I came back to several more
Fire Drill Fridays with my stepdaughter,

31:18.337 --> 31:21.423
and we watched
the crowd grow exponentially.

31:21.507 --> 31:24.384
It made me realize
the importance of having regular,

31:24.468 --> 31:26.970
ongoing actions and commitment.

31:27.054 --> 31:30.557
I started using you as an example
when I was organizing.

31:30.641 --> 31:31.642
And it worked.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.229
"I was able to get
more and more people of my generation

31:35.312 --> 31:38.982
to come out for local events
like the Youth Climate Strike."

31:39.066 --> 31:43.028
Seeing images
of senior celebrity activists like you

31:43.111 --> 31:47.449
inspires us all and creates
a sense of community.

31:48.033 --> 31:50.661
"You even inspired me
to accept the position

31:50.744 --> 31:53.622
of president
of the Elders Action Network…"

31:53.705 --> 31:58.252
…where we're building a movement of elders
addressing the environmental

31:58.335 --> 32:02.422
and social justice issues
for the welfare of all life.

32:03.298 --> 32:07.970
You have claimed your role as an elder,
as a leader, as a woman.

32:08.053 --> 32:10.889
"When I sent my grandnieces
and nephews pictures

32:10.973 --> 32:15.018
of me getting arrested with Jane Fonda,
they thought it was very cool."

32:15.561 --> 32:16.562
It was.

32:16.645 --> 32:22.276
Because of your work and your voice,
I have been able to inspire others.

32:22.359 --> 32:27.906
And together, we're making a better world
for all of our children.

32:29.867 --> 32:32.452
Oh, my God. This makes me so happy.

32:33.662 --> 32:35.122
You know, you just never know--

32:35.205 --> 32:40.252
you never know what the impact
of your actions are gonna be.

32:40.335 --> 32:46.550
And then you read a letter like this,
and everything is so worth it.

32:48.552 --> 32:52.723
I feel that telling stories about my life

32:52.806 --> 32:55.809
and explaining the things
that I've learned

32:55.893 --> 32:58.854
and why I've done
the things that I have done,

32:58.937 --> 33:00.606
has been very helpful.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.358
Especially to women. I know it has.

33:03.442 --> 33:06.278
- Jane, thank you so much.
- Thank you, Jane.

33:06.361 --> 33:07.738
Because I hear from them.

33:07.821 --> 33:10.157
Thank you for inspiring me
to follow my passion.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.827
You were the example
of how to dream and do.

33:13.911 --> 33:19.833
I just want to bring inspiration
to other women about their lives.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.335
People might not like the fact

33:21.418 --> 33:24.254
that I'm not a straight and narrow person
by any standards.

33:24.338 --> 33:27.049
Thank you for showing me
that that is totally okay.

33:27.132 --> 33:28.967
All my best, Kennedy.

33:29.051 --> 33:32.429
I hope I've made you proud, Sarina.

33:32.513 --> 33:35.849
Living my best life, Pamela.

33:35.933 --> 33:39.394
Your committed ally, Lynne.

33:39.478 --> 33:43.482
That's all the legacy I need.
I mean, is there anything more wonderful?
