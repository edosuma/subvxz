WEBVTT

00:32.865 --> 00:37.204
FARNSWORTH:
Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!

00:37.304 --> 00:39.207
Ooh! Ah!

00:39.307 --> 00:41.575
( shouting ):
I know you've rejected me
a lot before

00:41.674 --> 00:42.810
but frankly,
I wasn't sure

00:42.909 --> 00:44.545
we were right
for each other, either.

00:44.645 --> 00:48.115
But now I am,
so how about a date tonight?

00:48.216 --> 00:51.719
Sorry, I think I, uh,
I think I left my toaster on.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.220
FARNSWORTH:
Buddha! Zeus!

00:53.320 --> 00:57.490
God! One of you guys
do something!

00:57.591 --> 00:58.826
Come on, Leela.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.993
What's the real reason
you won't go out with me?

01:01.094 --> 01:03.996
Help, Satan, you owe me!

01:04.097 --> 01:06.766
Look, um, I'm embarrassed
to admit this

01:06.867 --> 01:08.801
but you've forced me to.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.570
I can't go out tonight
because...

01:10.670 --> 01:11.671
( yelling stops )

01:11.772 --> 01:14.507
I have sweaty boot rash!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.176
No spluh.
Why do you think

01:16.277 --> 01:18.978
I'm sitting over here
in the stink-free zone?

01:19.079 --> 01:19.980
( laughs )

01:20.079 --> 01:22.182
So, will you go out
with me?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.984
Good news, everyone.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.653
I'm still technically alive.
Yes.

01:26.754 --> 01:31.024
But I need you to dispose
of this crazy-ass experiment

01:31.125 --> 01:32.926
that almost killed me.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.528
You'll have to throw it
into the sun itself

01:35.628 --> 01:38.632
for only the thermonuclear
inferno of the sun

01:38.731 --> 01:42.203
has enough energy to ensure
its total destruction.

01:42.302 --> 01:43.704
I could hit it with a shovel.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.004
That's not good enough.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.539
This one time, I pounded a guy

01:46.640 --> 01:48.876
into the ground
like a stake with a shovel.

01:48.975 --> 01:49.877
Yes, yes.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.878
So what's in
the box already?

01:51.978 --> 01:52.979
No peeking!

01:53.079 --> 01:54.847
( gasping )

01:54.948 --> 01:56.849
I don't know
what's in there

01:56.950 --> 01:58.186
but I'm sure

01:58.286 --> 02:01.188
our minds would be unable
to comprehend it.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.524
Oh! You hurt my collator!

02:03.623 --> 02:04.825
I don't care.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.025
Listen well.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.694
No matter what happens

02:07.795 --> 02:10.198
no matter how great
your curiosity

02:10.298 --> 02:13.032
you are forbidden
to look in this box.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.568
Forbidden!

02:14.668 --> 02:17.538
Pretty tantalizing, though.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.173
FRYE:
Whatever's in there

02:19.272 --> 02:21.175
it's the only thing
I've ever wanted.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.811
In my experience,
boxes are usually empty

02:23.911 --> 02:26.813
or maybe with a little cheese
stuck to the top

02:26.913 --> 02:28.915
and one time, pepperoni.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.850
What a day that was!

02:30.950 --> 02:32.051
( warbling scream )

02:32.151 --> 02:33.387
Give me the box!

02:34.354 --> 02:37.057
Scram, you lousy
green snakes!

02:37.156 --> 02:38.925
( all yelling )

02:39.026 --> 02:40.026
Here, Leela, take this

02:40.127 --> 02:41.329
and use it to shoot
those guys.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.362
Right.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.865
If they try to look in the box.

02:44.965 --> 02:45.899
Whatever.

02:45.998 --> 02:48.100
Let's just forget
about the box.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.402
The Professor said
to stay away.

02:49.502 --> 02:52.372
Fry, how can you
be so naive?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.608
He was joking.
Get it?

02:54.707 --> 02:55.876
No.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.512
That's what
makes it so funny.

02:58.611 --> 03:00.548
( laughs )

03:00.647 --> 03:02.049
Okay, he wasn't joking.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.016
Now shut up and follow me.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.621
( hissing )

03:09.956 --> 03:11.191
FRY:
Oh, it's hot.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.426
The cream cheese in my pocket
is melting.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.270
( whirring )

03:24.872 --> 03:26.038
( whirring )

03:26.139 --> 03:29.610
( snoring )

03:29.710 --> 03:32.079
( chuckles )

03:37.450 --> 03:39.051
( whirring )

03:44.792 --> 03:45.793
We thank you, Bender

03:45.893 --> 03:48.094
for the gift
we're about to receive.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.466
( both gasp )

03:52.566 --> 03:54.067
Tangled-up Christmas lights.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.836
We can take shifts
untangling them.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.305
And unlabeled booze.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.139
Wide mouth, too.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.443
( grunting )

04:03.544 --> 04:05.679
That ought to keep
those dopes occupied.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.147
I can guard the real box
in peace

04:08.247 --> 04:10.350
now that no one's
curious about it.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.956
( humming )

04:22.430 --> 04:24.197
( forced humming )

04:36.276 --> 04:39.612
Well, I got through the night
and no one looked in the box--

04:39.713 --> 04:43.016
not even me, the person
who gave up her whole evening

04:43.115 --> 04:44.183
to watch it.

04:44.283 --> 04:46.052
A whole evening of TV gone.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.954
What a mockery of justice

04:48.055 --> 04:51.024
that I can't take
even a little tiny peek.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.024
( sighs )

04:52.125 --> 04:53.192
I need coffee.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.233
Okay, heads-- I look.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.336
Tails-- I don't.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.740
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Heads!

05:07.841 --> 05:10.076
I mean, all right, then.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.348
No. I have a duty not to look.

05:14.447 --> 05:18.218
Then again, I promised
the coin I would.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.356
Oh, it's deep.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.394
Deeper than a small box
should be.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.862
( yells )

05:28.961 --> 05:30.197
( grunts )

05:30.297 --> 05:32.500
Ouch! My lawyer
will hear about this.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.567
( door opens )

05:33.667 --> 05:34.935
FRY:
Leela, what have you done?

05:35.034 --> 05:36.370
Nothing.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.271
What do you mean,
why was I looking in the box?

05:38.372 --> 05:41.908
I meant you hair.
It's all differenty.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.411
Bender, is that you?

05:43.511 --> 05:45.745
You know it.
Large and in charge.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.348
Leela? Oh...

05:48.449 --> 05:49.783
There's a woman for you.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.183
Always dyeing her hair

05:51.283 --> 05:53.220
instead of not
looking in a box.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.588
I didn't dye my hair.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.255
This is how I always look.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.759
No, that's how you always look.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.362
( both gasp )

06:02.463 --> 06:06.733
This throws my entire perception
of reality into question.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.970
Clone, robot
or long-lost twin?

06:10.069 --> 06:11.370
Taking all bets.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.106
I also offer video poker.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.047
It's some guy wearing
a Leela costume.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.213
Get him.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.649
Hold it.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.485
You have this all wrong.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.819
I just fell into the box

06:25.918 --> 06:27.487
and then I fell out somehow.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.822
You shut up, sir.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.658
No, wait. I've got it.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.793
I know what's in the box.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.327
Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.463
Am not.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.832
It contains
a parallel universe

06:39.932 --> 06:41.634
and when you create

06:41.735 --> 06:46.973
a parallel universe, it's almost
always populated by evil twins.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.841
Now look, I am not evil.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.744
My loan officer said so.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.180
Oh, you'd like us
to believe that

06:53.279 --> 06:54.814
wouldn't you, Leela?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.683
Or should I say,
Evilla?!

06:56.783 --> 06:58.685
Aw, this is awful.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.754
Somewhere there's
a more evil Bender than me.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.355
I do my best, damn it!

07:03.456 --> 07:05.492
Leela-- the
good Leela--

07:05.593 --> 07:07.127
I want you
to snoop

07:07.226 --> 07:08.829
around the other universe

07:08.928 --> 07:10.963
and find out
how evil they are.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.266
Here.

07:13.365 --> 07:15.168
I tell you, they're not evil

07:15.268 --> 07:17.838
but don't be confused--
they are jerks.

07:17.937 --> 07:18.838
( grunts )

07:18.939 --> 07:20.774
ZOIDBERG:
Hello.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.511
( martial arts yell )

07:23.610 --> 07:26.379
Come out of your universe
with your hands up.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.120
Oh, wow, it's like
that drug trip

07:33.220 --> 07:34.187
I saw in that movie

07:34.286 --> 07:35.723
when I was on
that drug trip.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.490
Astonishing!

07:37.591 --> 07:39.992
I must have created
a parallel universe.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.360
Baldercrap!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.230
I created your universe.

07:43.329 --> 07:47.033
All you created was
my fist parallel
to your face.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.168
Ow.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.571
Look, it doesn't matter
who created what.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.172
The important thing is...

07:52.271 --> 07:53.406
( martial arts yell )

07:54.240 --> 07:56.143
...we're exactly
the same.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.711
I know all her moves.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.379
Therefore, I've got
the upper hand.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.915
BOTH:
Ow!

08:02.014 --> 08:05.485
Now, now, perfectly
symmetrical violence

08:05.586 --> 08:07.420
never solved anything.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.824
Let's recap what's happened
so far.

08:12.425 --> 08:15.095
As you can see,
I accidentally created

08:15.194 --> 08:17.329
a box containing
your universe.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.199
While I, in
a simultaneous blunder

08:20.300 --> 08:23.235
created a box containing
your universe.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.872
This is getting confusing.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.406
Why don't we call
our universe "Universe A"

08:27.507 --> 08:29.242
and this universe
"Universe B"?

08:29.341 --> 08:31.043
Hey, why can't
we be "Universe A"?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.044
Yeah!

08:32.144 --> 08:34.181
Yeah!
It's the
best letter!

08:34.280 --> 08:35.347
We called it first.

08:35.447 --> 08:36.850
Besides, this place
kind of feels

08:36.950 --> 08:38.018
like a "B," you know?

08:38.118 --> 08:40.754
All right, you can be
crummy "Universe A"

08:40.854 --> 08:42.623
and we'll be
"Universe One."

08:42.722 --> 08:43.923
Or "The Mongooses."

08:44.024 --> 08:45.524
That's a cool
team name.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.193
"The Fighting Mongooses."

08:47.293 --> 08:48.227
Wait a second.

08:48.327 --> 08:49.897
If everyone is identical

08:49.996 --> 08:52.264
why did our Leela look
into the box

08:52.365 --> 08:53.734
and your Leela didn't?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.536
Well, to be honest,
I tossed a coin.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.270
It came up tails,
so I didn't look.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.438
That's weird.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.408
Mine came up heads,
so I did.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.875
Interesting.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.913
Apparently, the
key difference
between our universes

09:06.013 --> 09:08.315
is that coin flips have
opposite outcomes.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.283
That explains
Fruity here.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.919
I tossed a coin
to pick my finish.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.254
Foghat Gray.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.090
Hey, bite my glorious
golden ass.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.726
You people and your
slight differences disgust me.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.961
I'm going home.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.096
Where's that blue box
with our universe in it?

09:24.197 --> 09:25.798
Oh, you'd like
to get back

09:25.899 --> 09:28.100
to your evil universe,
wouldn't you

09:28.201 --> 09:31.337
and destroy your box
with our universe inside it?

09:31.437 --> 09:32.504
Nonsense.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.173
I would never do such a thing

09:34.274 --> 09:37.277
unless you were already having
been going to do that.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.477
Wha...?

09:38.577 --> 09:39.613
You heard me.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.581
In any case,
I've hidden the box

09:41.682 --> 09:43.182
and it will remain hidden

09:43.283 --> 09:45.351
until I'm convinced
you're not evil.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.655
Everyone, keep an eye
on your evil counterpart.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.322
And you all do the same.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.826
Um, can Fry and I watch
our parallel selves together?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.261
We have plans tonight.

09:55.361 --> 09:56.996
You guys are dating?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.331
Oh, no, no.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.332
We're married.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.541
I got my eye
on you, boy.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.644
Don't even think
about it, lunch pail.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.846
You'd be dead before
you hit the ground.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.181
Good point.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.482
What do you say
we just hit a strip joint?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.518
I was waiting
for one of us
to say that.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.352
( both cheering )

10:20.452 --> 10:22.889
Bender A, you're a
prince among robots.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.524
Can you forgive me
for distrusting you?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.495
Aw, I can't stay mad at
what is essentially me.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.798
I love me.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.167
( both chuckling )

10:34.267 --> 10:37.070
This is so great!

10:37.169 --> 10:39.405
I always wanted
an imaginary friend.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.508
I'm not imaginary;
I'm parallel.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.411
We're exactly the same,
right down to the...

10:44.510 --> 10:47.514
Splech! Is that
pink nail polish?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.548
Is that not
pink nail polish?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.351
The Professor's right--
you a evil...

10:52.451 --> 10:54.187
and shallow.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.188
I am not evil.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.028
So, Fry, Leela,
how'd you two get together?

11:02.129 --> 11:03.263
Funny story.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.097
I asked Leela out
a million times

11:05.197 --> 11:06.899
but she just kept
rejecting me.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.702
I'd make up stuff like
"I have sweaty boot rash"

11:09.802 --> 11:11.571
or "I have to meet
the President."

11:11.671 --> 11:13.206
( chuckling )

11:13.306 --> 11:15.508
Oh, man,
you never heard such excuses

11:15.607 --> 11:17.509
but, like a dope,
I believed her.

11:17.610 --> 11:20.113
Looking back on it now,
it's kind of funny.

11:20.212 --> 11:21.514
It sure is.

11:21.614 --> 11:22.581
Right, Leela?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.917
Funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.952
Then one night, when
Fry asked me out

11:26.052 --> 11:28.520
the only excuse
I could think of
involved ghosts.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.889
I knew he wouldn't buy it.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.359
So, I did what I always
do in those situations.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.525
Oh, Lord.

11:33.625 --> 11:34.861
I flipped a coin.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.197
It came up heads
and we went out.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.966
You mean, you
flipped a coin, too

11:39.066 --> 11:40.299
and it was tails?

11:40.399 --> 11:42.870
So, that's why you said
you had to meet that ghost.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.304
You really missed out
on something, Leela.

11:45.404 --> 11:46.706
That date was magical.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.308
One year later, I gave Leela
a diamond scrunchy

11:49.408 --> 11:50.409
and we were married.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.879
Ooh...

11:51.979 --> 11:55.447
One year later, I got beat up
at a Neil Diamond concert

11:55.548 --> 11:57.049
by a guy named Scrunchy.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.486
( grunting )

12:00.586 --> 12:01.653
( grunting )

12:01.754 --> 12:03.123
( grunting )

12:03.222 --> 12:04.557
( grunting )

12:04.657 --> 12:05.826
Well, that
was pointless.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.628
Say, I hope you won't
think it "evil" of me

12:08.727 --> 12:11.331
to ask how you got
that stylish head wound.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.399
Oh, this old thing?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.803
I was experimenting to see
if I could remove my own brain.

12:16.903 --> 12:17.937
Of course.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.306
I had the same idea.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.740
I flipped a coin to decide
if I should proceed

12:21.841 --> 12:22.975
but it came up tails.

12:23.076 --> 12:23.976
So, I didn't.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.412
How'd it go?

12:25.511 --> 12:28.681
Well, getting
the brain out
was the easy part.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.418
The hard part was
getting the brain out.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.820
( crazy laughter )

12:32.919 --> 12:34.153
( chuckling ):
Oh, you.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.489
( flies buzzing )

12:36.588 --> 12:38.691
So, tell me
about yourself.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.159
Well, don't look into it

12:40.259 --> 12:42.830
but I'm a respected
internal medicine doctor.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.496
Ooh, a can!

12:44.596 --> 12:47.267
( slurping loudly )

12:47.366 --> 12:49.336
As for me,
I design mansions

12:49.436 --> 12:50.769
then live in them.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.706
( sobbing ):
I'm lying.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.808
I'm an appalling failure.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.845
( sobbing ):
Me, too.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.980
A big fat one.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.480
And those coworkers--

13:01.581 --> 13:03.850
always looking down
on us Zoidbergs.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.818
What are they,
from Nob Hill?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.187
They're all alike--

13:07.287 --> 13:09.522
"Stop spraying me
with ink, Zoidberg.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.158
"Put on pants, Zoidberg.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.493
Don't touch our fancy box,
Zoidberg."

13:13.592 --> 13:15.528
Ooh, that box!

13:15.628 --> 13:16.729
Too good for us, is it?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.465
Bah! Someday they'll watch

13:18.565 --> 13:20.567
from down in the gutter,
they will

13:20.667 --> 13:23.836
as King Zoidberg caresses
their fancy box.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.173
You know, maybe a certain
blue lobster saw

13:27.274 --> 13:29.475
where Professor hid the box.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.477
( chuckling deviously )

13:31.577 --> 13:34.681
( chuckling )

13:36.682 --> 13:38.085
Good news,
everyones.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.820
After carefully
reading the Scriptures

13:40.921 --> 13:43.690
we've concluded
that none of us are evil.

13:43.789 --> 13:46.525
Yes, the Bible is
the real "good news."

13:46.625 --> 13:50.663
Anyhow, you're all free
to go back to your own universe.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.899
What's going on here?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.534
Why aren't you all
out destroying the
Professor's box?

13:55.634 --> 13:56.870
Hermes, aren't
you curious

13:56.970 --> 13:59.005
about the fact
that there's two
of everybody?

13:59.105 --> 14:01.240
No. Now, like my Granny
used to say

14:01.341 --> 14:03.910
back in her tarpaper shack
on Montego Bay--

14:04.010 --> 14:06.278
"If you want a box hurled
into the Sun

14:06.379 --> 14:07.947
you got to do it yourself."

14:08.048 --> 14:09.615
Your granny can
go to hell.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.085
I've hidden the box
so no one can destroy

14:12.184 --> 14:14.854
the home universe
of my handsome
friend, here.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.123
Oh, go on.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.190
Wait a second.

14:17.289 --> 14:18.691
If your Hermes was

14:18.791 --> 14:21.793
about to destroy the box
containing our universe...

14:21.894 --> 14:24.397
Then your Hermes...

14:24.496 --> 14:26.066
Oh, my.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.034
ANNOUNCER:
And sure enough...

14:28.134 --> 14:29.135
( Hermes humming )

14:29.235 --> 14:31.303
Like Granny said

14:31.403 --> 14:34.040
"If you want a box hurled
into the Sun

14:34.140 --> 14:35.908
you got to do it yourself."

14:36.009 --> 14:39.078
God rest her zombie bones.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.484
LEELA B:
So we go back through the box
and stop Hermes.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.287
Right. Good thing
Professor B there

14:47.386 --> 14:49.588
hid it in
the coelacanth tank.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.624
No one but a crazy lobster
would look there.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.726
It's gone!

14:54.826 --> 14:56.895
( radio static )

14:56.996 --> 14:59.298
All hail Zoidberg

14:59.399 --> 15:00.667
the king with the box.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.835
( loud smooching )

15:02.936 --> 15:04.903
Now it's my turn maybe?

15:05.004 --> 15:07.573
The box says no.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.844
ANNOUNCER:
Meanwhile, in Universe A

15:11.945 --> 15:16.182
Hermes A heads
toward the sun... A.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.350
"Item one: box."

15:18.451 --> 15:19.485
Check.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.087
"Item two: sun."

15:21.187 --> 15:22.754
( sizzling )

15:22.855 --> 15:24.923
That's a big check.

15:40.506 --> 15:43.475
If I know parallel Hermes,
he's at the sun by now.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.278
Our universe is doomed!

15:46.379 --> 15:49.682
Dooooomed!
Dooooomed!

15:49.782 --> 15:52.384
Now, don't give up yet,
you crybabies.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.821
The box is gone,
but we still have

15:54.921 --> 15:56.889
one preposterously slim hope.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.658
Is it a kind
of hair spray?

15:58.758 --> 16:01.061
No! We must attempt to make

16:01.160 --> 16:05.131
another box containing
our universe. Doy.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.735
( electronic
buzzing and zapping )

16:10.836 --> 16:14.541
( Professors yelling )

16:16.509 --> 16:18.010
Well

16:18.110 --> 16:19.812
is that your universes
in there?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.347
Nope. Too cold.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.518
Hmm. All women.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.421
I'll put this one aside
for later.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.057
( Leela screaming )

16:31.158 --> 16:32.859
Oh, mon, it's hopeless.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.327
We'll never find your universe
in time.

16:35.427 --> 16:37.764
Plus, this box is stuck
on my fat head.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.167
Yes, it's the Apocalypse,
all right.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.735
I always thought
I'd have a hand in it.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.171
I'm not sad...

16:44.270 --> 16:47.005
because I finally found
someone as great as me.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.042
It's like I always say:

16:49.142 --> 16:51.344
"Make new friends,
but keep the old.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.879
One is silver..."

16:52.979 --> 16:55.014
( voice breaking ):
"And the other's gold."

16:55.115 --> 16:56.749
( loud clunk )

16:56.849 --> 16:58.551
( both sobbing )

16:59.686 --> 17:02.188
Why with the long faces?

17:02.288 --> 17:04.356
( gasps ):
The idiots have the box!

17:04.457 --> 17:06.259
I think she means you.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.259
Grab them!

17:07.359 --> 17:08.928
( Zoidbergs whimpering )

17:11.897 --> 17:14.634
You coward! Wait for me!

17:20.772 --> 17:23.875
Blug! Which one
did they go into?

17:23.976 --> 17:25.978
Oh, let's all ask each other!

17:26.078 --> 17:28.115
That'll solve this problem!

17:28.214 --> 17:30.482
We'll each have to search
a universe.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.818
Everyone grab a length
of wire first

17:32.919 --> 17:34.987
so you can find your way back.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.336
Woo-woo!
Woo-woo!

17:51.002 --> 17:52.605
Hello?

17:52.704 --> 17:54.507
Did you see
two smelly lobsters?

17:54.606 --> 17:58.076
We didn't see
anything...

17:58.177 --> 17:59.578
ever.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.652
Yo, uh, did two shellfish
in scrubs go by?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.153
Hell, no.
Shut up.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.588
Beat it, jerk!

18:12.791 --> 18:15.662
Uh, have you robot versions
of you guys

18:15.761 --> 18:18.464
seen any extra Zoidbergs
around here?

18:18.565 --> 18:21.000
( mechanically ):
Negative.
Will you go out with me?

18:21.099 --> 18:23.135
Uh, access denied.

18:25.538 --> 18:29.040
( chalk squeaking )

18:29.142 --> 18:33.680
Hey, pal, look what I snagged
from the leprechaun universe.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.981
Yeah, leprechaun universe
is fine...

18:36.082 --> 18:40.487
if you haven't seen
pirate universe.

18:40.586 --> 18:43.021
( gasps ):
Faith and begorra!

18:44.123 --> 18:45.825
Que?

18:47.326 --> 18:49.162
Quick! Into another box!

18:49.261 --> 18:51.798
There aren't any
in this universe,
there aren't.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.500
Hey, you, what
with the no boxes?

18:53.599 --> 18:55.335
Baby, they're somewhere.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.237
Everything's,
like, somewhere.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.307
Place is kind of
au naturel right now.

19:01.540 --> 19:02.375
There they are!

19:02.474 --> 19:03.710
( both gasp )

19:03.809 --> 19:04.876
Gotcha!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.846
Dig it, all of you
fitting in this box

19:07.946 --> 19:10.182
is, like, seriously freaked up.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.353
Nonsense! Why, there's
a whole universe in there.

19:13.452 --> 19:17.022
Dude, there's a universe
in all of us.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.259
Right on,
Professor Freaksworth!

19:21.428 --> 19:22.595
Get a job!

19:22.694 --> 19:24.263
We've got the box!

19:24.364 --> 19:26.499
Everyone pull your wires!

19:27.567 --> 19:29.101
( grunting and gasping )

19:30.169 --> 19:32.271
( all yelling )

19:35.442 --> 19:38.611
Hurry! Back to Universe A!

19:38.711 --> 19:41.681
( grunting )

19:59.598 --> 20:03.201
( all grunting )

20:03.303 --> 20:06.038
Hermes! Don't press
that button!

20:12.077 --> 20:13.813
Okay.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.150
Bye, Leela.
Bye-bye.
So long.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.653
So long, Your Majesty.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.160
There but for the flip
of a coin go we.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.998
So, um, Leela, seeing how
the universe wasn't destroyed

20:32.097 --> 20:34.334
uh, you want to catch
an ape fight?

20:34.433 --> 20:35.835
You know, together?

20:35.934 --> 20:39.672
Well... I guess you deserve
one more flip.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.510
So? Heads or tails?

20:44.611 --> 20:47.346
You know, let's
just say it's heads.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.982
Ready?

20:51.083 --> 20:55.153
BOTH PROFESSORS:
One, two, three... pull!

20:57.589 --> 20:58.691
There.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.992
That space-time eversion

21:01.093 --> 21:04.163
has given us their
box, and vice versa.

21:04.262 --> 21:06.833
So what you think you just
explained to us is that...

21:06.932 --> 21:11.604
Correct! This box contains
our own universe!

21:11.703 --> 21:13.105
( all gasp )

21:13.204 --> 21:15.207
Sweet honeybee of infinity!

21:16.843 --> 21:19.346
( people grunting and gasping )

21:21.448 --> 21:25.217
Bender, quit destroying
the universe.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.355
But... Oh!

21:28.454 --> 21:32.791
Yes, all that is
and ever shall be
is in that box.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.662
And the box itself
