WEBVTT

00:00.313 --> 00:01.474
Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:01.475 --> 00:03.296
She thinks there's another
serial killer out there.

00:03.297 --> 00:05.147
Because that's what Pelant
told her before he died.

00:05.148 --> 00:06.981
If anything happens to me, uh, she...
she'll keep doing

00:06.982 --> 00:08.498
what she's doing.

00:08.499 --> 00:10.433
And you'll never
find out who she is.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.002
<i>I believe Lana Brewster</i>

00:12.036 --> 00:13.937
<i>was the first</i>
<i>Ghost Killer victim.</i>

00:13.971 --> 00:16.271
<i>Trent McNamara was</i>
<i>a nasty piece of work,</i>

00:16.306 --> 00:18.074
<i>and that's his sister</i>
<i>Stephanie.</i>

00:18.109 --> 00:20.577
We have evidence your father
paid off a medical examiner

00:20.611 --> 00:22.679
to cover up the fact
that Lana was murdered.

00:22.713 --> 00:25.482
You think I killed Lana?
This family's been harassed enough.

00:25.516 --> 00:29.052
I've seen this one before, on
one of the Ghost Killer victims.

00:29.086 --> 00:31.021
I'd like to help, Seeley,
but Dr. Brennan has

00:31.055 --> 00:33.423
no evidence to link these
cases to a serial killer.

00:33.457 --> 00:36.426
These are the files on
all six Ghost Killer victims.

00:36.460 --> 00:38.662
I want <i>you</i> to oversee this one.

00:38.696 --> 00:40.897
Does Dr. Brennan know you're
making me responsible for these?

00:40.931 --> 00:43.366
Why would you give those
remains to Dr. Edison?

00:43.401 --> 00:45.935
A single gunshot wound
to the temple.

00:45.970 --> 00:48.038
This sure looks to me
like an admission of guilt.

00:48.072 --> 00:50.807
I read your autopsy
report on Trent McNamara.

00:50.841 --> 00:52.609
Yes, his fingernail
was ripped off.

00:52.643 --> 00:56.146
Lana Brewster sustained
the exact same wound.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.381
What do you think?
I think we're gonna catch her.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.483
Her?

01:00.518 --> 01:02.285
That's what you said-- her.

01:02.319 --> 01:03.620
Well, you believe me?

01:03.654 --> 01:05.288
Mm-hmm.

01:06.424 --> 01:07.991
And the forest demon
took the shape

01:08.025 --> 01:09.392
of the last man murdered.

01:09.427 --> 01:12.195
He glided through the
woods on the wind,

01:12.229 --> 01:14.698
looking for new
victims to feed on.

01:14.732 --> 01:16.533
Stop, Dad,
this is stupid.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.268
You're just scared.

01:18.302 --> 01:19.187
Am not.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.185
Think you're going
a little overboard, Mike.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.039
That's what the demon's
last victim said.

01:23.074 --> 01:25.141
She was part of a family
just like us,

01:25.176 --> 01:28.478
sitting around a campfire,
marshmallows on sticks.

01:28.512 --> 01:30.880
We should've stayed in
the regular campground.

01:30.915 --> 01:33.383
It's creepy with
no one else around.

01:33.417 --> 01:34.384
I like it, Dad.

01:34.418 --> 01:36.519
Go on.
It was quiet that night.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.088
The family suspected nothing.

01:38.122 --> 01:40.457
Till the leaves
started rustling.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.659
It's just the wind, Allison.
Still oozing

01:42.693 --> 01:45.261
with blood from
his last victim,

01:45.296 --> 01:48.189
he catches the scent of
the innocent family.

01:48.190 --> 01:50.391
Okay, that's enough.
Stop it, Mike.

01:50.425 --> 01:53.094
Now.
It's just a stupid ghost story.

01:53.128 --> 01:54.662
It's okay, buddy.
We're here to have fun.

01:54.696 --> 01:56.330
Let's just roast
our marshmallows,

01:56.364 --> 01:59.667
and sing a few songs
before we turn in.

01:59.701 --> 02:02.903
Thank God.

02:02.938 --> 02:04.472
What was that?

02:04.506 --> 02:06.207
Nothing, honey.

02:06.241 --> 02:09.376
Probably just a... a bunny
or a chipmunk or something.

02:12.247 --> 02:13.714
I swear to God, Michael,

02:13.748 --> 02:15.716
this is the cruelest thing
you've ever done.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.051
You're the best, Dad.

02:17.085 --> 02:18.252
I-I-I...

02:21.256 --> 02:23.791
Awesome!

02:29.197 --> 02:30.831
<i>Hey. Oh,</i>

02:30.866 --> 02:32.566
is that my Bureau assessment
you're filling out?

02:32.601 --> 02:34.727
Yes. They wanted me to,
because we're partners.

02:34.728 --> 02:35.228
Oh.

02:35.253 --> 02:37.037
But you're not
allowed to look at it.

02:37.038 --> 02:38.372
It's confidential.
What are all those, uh,

02:38.406 --> 02:40.374
papers there?
This is my

02:40.408 --> 02:41.837
answer to question 3a.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.862
3a? They only have
three little lines for that.

02:43.912 --> 02:45.230
It says use additional
paper, if necessary.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.493
You must have at least 15
pieces of paper...

02:46.518 --> 02:48.015
Eighteen.

02:48.016 --> 02:51.118
18. On comportment?
Well, okay, don't look.

02:51.153 --> 02:54.221
You know this promotion
affects you, too.

02:54.256 --> 02:56.100
I was told to be objective
and dispassionate.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.858
That sounds terrible.

02:57.859 --> 03:00.161
I think your comportment
is excellent, by the way.

03:00.195 --> 03:01.395
Thank you.
For the most part.

03:01.429 --> 03:02.997
Right. Ah.

03:04.499 --> 03:06.500
Booth.

03:06.535 --> 03:08.068
Hey, Camille.

03:08.103 --> 03:10.004
Don't-Don't call me Seeley.

03:10.038 --> 03:11.071
Right. Okay.

03:11.106 --> 03:12.640
On our way.

03:12.674 --> 03:14.308
Oh.

03:16.811 --> 03:19.046
I really don't think
that's a good idea.

03:19.948 --> 03:21.148
Look, I'm just saying...

03:21.183 --> 03:22.483
Okay, it's your call.

03:22.517 --> 03:23.951
Got it. Bye.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.219
What was that?

03:25.253 --> 03:26.720
It's a body in the woods.
Oh.

03:26.755 --> 03:27.788
Okay, I'll get ready.

03:27.822 --> 03:29.456
Cam just wants me to go.

03:29.491 --> 03:32.960
What? I always go with you
to a murder scene.

03:32.994 --> 03:34.929
We're partners.
She's bringing Clark out on this one.

03:34.963 --> 03:37.831
Clark? I'm the head of forensic
anthropology. What is going on?

03:37.866 --> 03:40.587
Well, she thinks that this has
something to do with the Ghost Killer.

03:40.602 --> 03:42.336
And since, you know,
Clark is heading this up...

03:42.370 --> 03:44.805
She thinks I'm incapable
of being objective about

03:44.839 --> 03:46.377
the Ghost Killer,
which is absurd.

03:46.378 --> 03:48.449
I'm being dispassionate
about you; I'm coming.

03:48.474 --> 03:49.476
Technically,

03:49.477 --> 03:50.844
you know, she has
the jurisdiction to decide

03:50.879 --> 03:52.913
which tech goes.
Technically?

03:52.948 --> 03:55.049
I laid all the groundwork
for the Ghost Killer case.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.952
I know, but you know...
you know how you and Cam

03:57.986 --> 03:59.887
got into it, last time,
on this one.

03:59.921 --> 04:02.256
What about you? Do you think
that I'm the best person

04:02.290 --> 04:04.692
to investigate this case?
Of course I do.

04:04.726 --> 04:06.727
It's not my call, okay?
Don't shoot the messenger here.

04:06.761 --> 04:09.363
You just... Just take the
high road on this, all right?

04:09.397 --> 04:11.765
Just show Cam that
you're a team player.

04:23.345 --> 04:24.979
You know Bones
is pissed, don't you?

04:25.013 --> 04:27.014
Hey, look, I'm just
doing my job.

04:27.048 --> 04:28.582
Just tell Dr. Brennan
it wasn't my fault.

04:28.617 --> 04:29.883
- Good luck with that.
- Sorry, Seeley.

04:29.918 --> 04:31.552
I'm not gonna have her veer

04:31.586 --> 04:33.220
an investigation off track
because she wants this

04:33.255 --> 04:35.055
- to be the Ghost Killer.
- Well, you must have

04:35.090 --> 04:37.358
suspected something or you
wouldn't have excluded her.

04:37.392 --> 04:38.826
I do, but it's not
conclusive yet.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.494
The victim appears
to have been stabbed.

04:40.528 --> 04:42.563
Whoa! And the head
was chopped off.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.431
Actually, no.
The victim was strung up

04:44.466 --> 04:45.733
after she was
already dead.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.268
Oh, wow.

04:47.302 --> 04:49.036
Yeah. The body separated
from the head during decomp.

04:49.070 --> 04:50.404
It fell on a family
that was camping.

04:50.438 --> 04:51.905
I have a feeling
they're gonna be staying

04:51.940 --> 04:53.301
in hotels from now on.
Right, so...

04:53.308 --> 04:54.875
it was killed, then hung.

04:54.909 --> 04:56.377
All right? There's no attempt
to hide the body.

04:56.411 --> 04:57.711
The lack of a prominent glabella

04:57.746 --> 04:59.213
indicates the victim was female.
Okay, well,

04:59.247 --> 05:00.814
the body is very gooey, here.

05:00.849 --> 05:01.669
Any, uh... you got
time of death, bug boy?

05:01.670 --> 05:04.191
Predation, blow flies and rove beetles
put time of death

05:04.192 --> 05:05.492
between eight and ten days.

05:05.526 --> 05:07.227
So far, I hear nothing
that connects this

05:07.262 --> 05:08.462
to the Ghost Killer.

05:08.496 --> 05:09.529
Well, I need to compare this

05:09.564 --> 05:11.431
to the other potential victims.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.100
That's gonna take time, Agent Booth.
I don't have time.

05:13.134 --> 05:15.102
And I can't start a serial
killer investigation

05:15.136 --> 05:16.803
unless we're certain.
Oh, God.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.939
Why didn't I just wait
for the pictures?

05:18.973 --> 05:20.340
You know what?
I know I'm supposed to be

05:20.375 --> 05:22.109
a good soldier here,
and I'm trying real hard,

05:22.143 --> 05:23.343
but we all know that
Bones should be here.

05:23.378 --> 05:25.379
Which is why I am, Booth.
Yes.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.147
Dr. Brennan, I specifically
told you to wait until called.

05:27.181 --> 05:30.550
You are not to touch the rema...
The third finger

05:30.585 --> 05:32.586
on the right hand has
an avulsion fracture

05:32.620 --> 05:33.887
on the superior aspect

05:33.922 --> 05:36.056
of the distal phalanx.
The fingernail

05:36.090 --> 05:38.258
has been ripped off, just like
every other Ghost Killer victim.

05:38.293 --> 05:39.693
Did you not see this?

05:39.727 --> 05:40.894
Yes, I did.

05:40.929 --> 05:42.396
And you can check my notes.

05:42.430 --> 05:43.664
Now can I please
get back to work?

05:43.698 --> 05:44.998
Fighting among the squints

05:45.033 --> 05:46.833
can compromise the case.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.869
You don't want this going on
the report when the muckymucks

05:48.903 --> 05:50.404
- are deciding who to promote.
- You know what?

05:50.438 --> 05:51.638
I don't care
about the muckymucks.

05:51.673 --> 05:53.040
Bones should have been here
from the beginning.

05:53.074 --> 05:54.641
Seeley...
This evidence should have been linked

05:54.676 --> 05:56.677
- to the Ghost Killer immediately.
- I did.

05:56.711 --> 05:59.279
I also noted the other fingers.
Unless you're

05:59.314 --> 06:00.614
too arrogant to
look at my findings.

06:00.648 --> 06:02.716
Oh!
Uh-oh.

06:04.919 --> 06:07.187
All of them
have avulsion fractures.

06:07.221 --> 06:08.922
Yes, all the nails
were ripped out.

06:08.957 --> 06:10.724
The Ghost Killer's
never done that before.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.092
Those fractures are old.

06:12.126 --> 06:13.660
Just check the remodeling.

06:13.695 --> 06:15.796
With traces of

06:15.830 --> 06:17.731
what seems to be an adhesive.

06:17.765 --> 06:19.606
Well, that might explain these.
What are those?

06:20.601 --> 06:22.169
Well, maybe the victim

06:22.203 --> 06:24.471
couldn't grow her own nails,
so she wore artificial ones.

06:25.807 --> 06:28.108
These aren't artificial.

06:28.142 --> 06:29.643
These nails are real.

06:29.677 --> 06:30.978
Real?

06:31.012 --> 06:33.880
Who glues on real nails
to themselves?

07:11.812 --> 07:13.780
So we're
finally calling it.

07:13.814 --> 07:14.981
The Ghost Killer exists.

07:15.015 --> 07:17.683
Every victim
has had the fingernail

07:17.718 --> 07:19.786
of the third distal
phalanx torn off.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.889
That signature suggests
the work of the same killer.

07:22.923 --> 07:24.157
The X-rays show

07:24.191 --> 07:26.793
multiple sharp force
trauma injuries.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.361
There are
also indications

07:28.395 --> 07:30.596
of blunt force trauma
on what little tissue is left.

07:30.631 --> 07:32.064
This is a far more
violent murder

07:32.099 --> 07:33.866
than the others.
Until the bones are clean,

07:33.901 --> 07:36.335
we can't determine
which are post-

07:36.370 --> 07:37.737
and which are perimortem.

07:37.771 --> 07:40.006
So you two are
cool with each other?

07:40.040 --> 07:41.207
Oh. Dr. Edison's

07:41.241 --> 07:42.775
work has been excellent.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.310
And I imagine
he is relieved

07:44.344 --> 07:45.611
to be working with me.

07:45.646 --> 07:46.913
As soon as

07:46.947 --> 07:48.614
Dr. Saroyan apologizes

07:48.649 --> 07:50.850
for excluding me...
Which you ignored.

07:50.884 --> 07:52.785
And which I would
ignore again.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.455
Oh, boy... I poked
a hornet's nest, didn't I?

07:55.489 --> 07:56.856
Am I the only professional here?

07:56.890 --> 07:58.791
Well, this bladder
seems to be intact,

07:58.826 --> 08:01.594
which means I'll be able
to run a tox screen.

08:01.628 --> 08:03.429
Has Dr. Hodgins returned
from the crime scene?

08:03.430 --> 08:05.131
I need these
wounds swabbed.

08:05.165 --> 08:06.365
He's still there,
looking for

08:06.400 --> 08:08.901
fingernails and any
other particulates

08:08.936 --> 08:11.237
- that'll tell us who this victim is.
- The skull is intact.

08:11.271 --> 08:13.739
So how long do you think
it'll take you to get an I.D.?

08:13.774 --> 08:14.889
As soon as Brennan gives it
to me, I can...

08:14.914 --> 08:16.042
I don't think

08:16.043 --> 08:17.643
that'll be necessary.
Can you bring up

08:17.678 --> 08:19.879
Trent McNamara's
skull X-rays?

08:19.913 --> 08:21.547
- The last victim?
- Technically, not a victim.

08:21.582 --> 08:23.149
His death was ruled a suicide.

08:23.183 --> 08:24.684
You may want
to re-evaluate

08:24.718 --> 08:25.985
that ruling.

08:26.019 --> 08:27.386
Notice the forward prominence

08:27.421 --> 08:28.588
of the lower mandible.

08:28.622 --> 08:30.156
This is a rare
genetic marker

08:30.190 --> 08:32.357
known as prognathism.

08:32.392 --> 08:34.327
Now, bring up this victim.

08:35.895 --> 08:37.129
Mm-hmm.

08:37.164 --> 08:40.265
Same prognathism...
I mean, albeit mild.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.068
You think this victim
is a McNamara?

08:42.102 --> 08:43.336
Statistically,

08:43.370 --> 08:45.037
that's a reasonable conclusion,

08:45.072 --> 08:47.740
and since there was only one
surviving member of the family,

08:47.774 --> 08:50.042
this must be Trent's sister,
Stephanie.

08:50.077 --> 08:51.244
Excellent.

08:51.278 --> 08:52.545
But why would
the Ghost Killer

08:52.579 --> 08:54.514
target the McNamaras?

08:58.919 --> 09:01.721
In most of the previous cases,
the remains were hidden.

09:01.755 --> 09:03.035
Or the killings
were made to look

09:03.056 --> 09:04.457
like an accident.

09:04.491 --> 09:05.825
Hanging the victim
from the tree was brazen.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.159
It was theatrical, even.

09:07.194 --> 09:08.694
The Ghost Killer
is upping his game.

09:08.729 --> 09:09.862
He's thumbing his nose at us.
Her.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.098
Bones thinks that
the killer is a woman.

09:12.132 --> 09:13.699
- She's never been wrong.
- Good enough for me, <i>cher.</i>

09:13.734 --> 09:14.901
But why two McNamaras?

09:14.935 --> 09:16.168
There's never been
a connection

09:16.203 --> 09:17.403
between the victims before.

09:17.437 --> 09:18.604
That we know of.

09:18.639 --> 09:19.906
The connections
could all just

09:19.940 --> 09:21.340
be in his-- or her-- mind.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.075
Serial killers
often develop

09:23.110 --> 09:24.544
elaborate rationalizations

09:24.578 --> 09:25.945
to justify their actions.

09:25.979 --> 09:27.480
Hence the creepy fingernails.

09:27.514 --> 09:29.749
They put me off manicures,
I can tell you that.

09:29.783 --> 09:31.050
You know, what ties
her actions together

09:31.084 --> 09:32.985
could be impossible
for us to know

09:33.020 --> 09:35.087
until we talk to her.
Or maybe the killer just thought

09:35.122 --> 09:36.455
that Stephanie McNamara

09:36.490 --> 09:38.190
was investigating
her brother's death

09:38.225 --> 09:40.293
and killed her because
she was getting too close.

09:40.327 --> 09:41.694
Incoming.

09:43.564 --> 09:44.864
The Deputy Director?

09:44.898 --> 09:45.898
He never comes down here.

09:45.933 --> 09:46.899
You want a breath mint?

09:46.934 --> 09:47.967
Breath mint? No.

09:48.001 --> 09:48.768
Mm.

09:48.802 --> 09:51.170
Agent Booth.
Yes.

09:51.204 --> 09:52.738
Ms. Julian.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.107
Uh, Dr. Sweets.

09:55.142 --> 09:56.275
I'm a profiler.

09:56.310 --> 09:57.710
Of course. Dr. Sweets.

09:57.744 --> 09:59.579
Just wanted to tell you
we understand

09:59.613 --> 10:00.846
the importance
of this case.

10:00.881 --> 10:02.048
We'll offer you

10:02.082 --> 10:03.449
any support you need.

10:03.483 --> 10:05.084
Because the McNamaras
are involved, right?

10:05.118 --> 10:06.419
I'm sure Agent
Booth merely meant

10:06.453 --> 10:08.254
that since Stephanie
McNamara was...

10:08.288 --> 10:11.023
I know what Agent Booth meant.
And I appreciate his honesty.

10:11.058 --> 10:11.995
That's why you're on our short 
list for the...

10:12.020 --> 10:12.892
I'm not in it

10:12.893 --> 10:14.727
for a promotion, sir, I just
want to catch the murderer.

10:14.761 --> 10:16.128
Of course.

10:16.163 --> 10:17.330
And you're right about
the McNamaras.

10:17.364 --> 10:18.831
They were a very
powerful family.

10:18.865 --> 10:20.099
Wealth has its privileges.

10:20.133 --> 10:22.635
Yes, it does,
Ms. Julian.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.136
And there are people
more powerful than I

10:24.171 --> 10:26.138
that want this resolved.
Quickly.

10:26.173 --> 10:27.740
It'll take
as long as it takes, sir.

10:27.774 --> 10:29.742
I want to give Ms. Julian
a case that sticks.

10:31.378 --> 10:33.446
I would expect nothing less.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.481
Glad you're running point
on this one, Booth.

10:35.515 --> 10:37.917
Thank you, sir.

10:39.386 --> 10:40.953
Hey. It took a while,

10:40.988 --> 10:42.788
but I retrieved the other nails
from the crime scene.

10:42.823 --> 10:44.457
At least pieces of all of them.
Great.

10:44.491 --> 10:45.791
I'll check for DNA under them,

10:45.826 --> 10:47.326
in case the victim
scratched her assailant.

10:47.361 --> 10:49.595
And I'll look at the rope
used for the noose.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.364
Some of the killer
might be on that, too.

10:51.398 --> 10:52.298
Dr. Hodgins?

10:52.332 --> 10:54.066
Yeah.
I'm sorry,

10:54.101 --> 10:55.935
by the way.
I know you knew the family.

10:55.969 --> 10:57.670
Oh, yeah.

10:57.704 --> 11:01.707
The truth is, the family
was always strange, you know?

11:01.742 --> 11:04.377
Like they were living under a cloud.
A very wealthy cloud.

11:04.411 --> 11:06.078
Yeah, tons of money,

11:06.113 --> 11:08.381
and all that's left is murder,
sadness and secrets.

11:08.415 --> 11:11.350
I'm telling you, I'm doing
a hell of a lot better broke.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.721
Well, got the blood results.

11:15.756 --> 11:19.925
Wait a minute-- she tested
positive for alkaloid cytosine?

11:19.960 --> 11:22.728
Which is what?
It's also known as sophorine.

11:22.763 --> 11:24.430
It's part
of the <i>Fabaceae</i> family,

11:24.464 --> 11:26.032
like peas, beans, legumes.

11:26.066 --> 11:28.834
Hey, if sophorine is mixed
with dimethyl sulfoxide,

11:28.869 --> 11:30.436
it becomes an anesthetic.

11:30.470 --> 11:31.837
So, she was drugged?

11:31.872 --> 11:33.233
It's probably how
she was abducted.

11:33.240 --> 11:33.973
Is there any way to trace

11:33.974 --> 11:35.583
where the killer got
the anesthetic from?

11:35.608 --> 11:36.308
No.

11:36.309 --> 11:37.777
It has to be homemade.

11:37.811 --> 11:39.478
Homemade and,
therefore, untraceable.

11:39.513 --> 11:43.382
There's a reason
why we call the killer a ghost.

11:45.018 --> 11:47.687
<i>So, the gardener at</i>

11:47.721 --> 11:49.121
the McNamaras' compound
was the last person

11:49.156 --> 11:52.091
to report seeing
Stephanie McNamara alive.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.527
You think she could have
made that anesthetic?

11:54.561 --> 11:56.962
I imagine she'd need
a science background.

11:56.997 --> 12:00.166
Well, she dropped out of high school
to work for the McNamaras.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.468
You know, I wrote seven pages
on your problem-solving skills.

12:02.502 --> 12:05.237
Wow. Seven.
Which I said were excellent.

12:05.272 --> 12:07.907
Thanks, Bones.
Although, I admitted

12:07.941 --> 12:11.243
to being skeptical
about your reliance on your gut.

12:11.278 --> 12:13.112
But I explained it...
Huh?

12:13.146 --> 12:15.715
...by referencing
studies showing that

12:15.749 --> 12:17.850
gut instincts are merely
highly-developed

12:17.884 --> 12:19.552
observational powers.

12:19.586 --> 12:21.889
So it's probably your eyes
more than your gut.

12:21.890 --> 12:23.100
You know, you're
amazing, you know that?

12:23.125 --> 12:24.056
Yes.

12:24.057 --> 12:26.258
However, I'm not sure
what exemplary quality

12:26.293 --> 12:27.960
you're referencing--
my intellect, or...

12:27.994 --> 12:29.929
Your support.

12:29.963 --> 12:32.298
Your... Thanks.

12:32.332 --> 12:33.833
Thanks.

12:33.867 --> 12:35.501
How could I not support you?

12:35.535 --> 12:39.505
You believed in me, even when
there's no tangible evidence

12:39.539 --> 12:41.373
the Ghost Killer existed.

12:41.408 --> 12:43.876
I guess it was my gut.

12:47.848 --> 12:49.648
<i>The tack room was</i>
<i>the last place I saw her.</i>

12:49.683 --> 12:51.183
It was Sunday.

12:51.218 --> 12:53.219
Stephanie left at 10:00 a.m.
for her morning ride,

12:53.253 --> 12:54.720
and she never came back
to the house.

12:54.755 --> 12:56.222
Why didn't you
report her missing?

12:56.256 --> 12:57.990
I'm just an employee
of the McNamaras.

12:58.024 --> 12:59.859
I don't know her schedule.

12:59.893 --> 13:02.094
Sometimes she'd be gone
for weeks on a trip.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.996
You just, uh, tend the garden.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.598
That's right.

13:05.632 --> 13:08.667
Do you have any plants
in the <i>Fabaceae</i> family here?

13:08.702 --> 13:11.637
Yes. Peas and beans. Why?

13:11.671 --> 13:13.072
Well, she likes to garden, too.

13:17.010 --> 13:18.410
Look at this, Booth.

13:18.445 --> 13:20.212
What's that?

13:20.247 --> 13:22.615
Scratch marks.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.754
Stephanie?

13:29.890 --> 13:31.957
I don't think so.

13:31.992 --> 13:34.293
This dried blood
is highly oxidized.

13:34.327 --> 13:36.829
This happened a long time ago.

13:36.863 --> 13:39.431
What's that?

13:45.539 --> 13:46.872
Fragment of a fingernail.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.507
A fingernail.

13:48.542 --> 13:49.942
Okay, looks like
somebody was trying

13:49.943 --> 13:51.343
to claw their
way out of this.

13:51.378 --> 13:52.812
Do you know anything
about this?

13:52.846 --> 13:55.214
No.

13:55.248 --> 13:57.449
Hold up a second.

13:58.351 --> 14:00.619
These markings look recent.

14:00.654 --> 14:03.489
Someone kicked out,
was trying to get away.

14:03.523 --> 14:06.392
This is probably where
Stephanie McNamara was abducted.

14:11.102 --> 14:13.670
I've finished cataloguing
Stephanie's perimortem injuries.

14:13.704 --> 14:16.339
In total, 16 sharp force
trauma injuries,

14:16.374 --> 14:19.876
most of which were concentrated
on the torso and neck.

14:19.911 --> 14:22.646
Based on the striae, the weapon
had an irregular serrated blade.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.048
Any idea what was
used in the assault?

14:25.082 --> 14:27.751
Not yet. I'm having Dr. Hodgins
swab the wounds for trace.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.252
If there are plant particulates,

14:29.287 --> 14:31.221
it could help point
to the McNamara's gardener.

14:31.255 --> 14:33.623
So far, we've found
nothing that ties her

14:33.658 --> 14:36.726
to the abduction or the
preparation of the anesthetic.

14:36.761 --> 14:38.795
No.

14:38.830 --> 14:41.031
Dr. Brennan...

14:41.065 --> 14:43.266
I just have to say
how much I appreciate

14:43.301 --> 14:44.701
how accepting you've been

14:44.735 --> 14:46.603
about me working
with you on this case.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.705
Yes.

14:48.739 --> 14:51.875
That is rare for me,
isn't it?

14:51.909 --> 14:54.244
Yes, it is.

14:54.278 --> 14:56.947
And I know Pelant told you
you would never be able

14:56.981 --> 14:59.349
to catch this Ghost Killer
without his expertise.

14:59.383 --> 15:02.285
I'm determined
to prove him wrong.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.888
I appreciate that, Clark.

15:04.922 --> 15:07.991
And the nails?

15:08.025 --> 15:10.827
Oh! Well, that's actually
the most interesting finding.

15:10.862 --> 15:14.664
Oh. Next time, please lead with
the most interesting finding.

15:14.699 --> 15:16.199
Well, I guess I like the build.

15:16.234 --> 15:20.737
I'm more of a crescendo
kind of guy.

15:20.771 --> 15:21.872
Now...

15:24.141 --> 15:25.775
Notice the nail beds?

15:25.810 --> 15:28.745
They're torn and remodeled.
Any new nails

15:28.779 --> 15:30.447
Stephanie grew would have
been irregular at best,

15:30.481 --> 15:32.983
if not totally deformed.
And look at the remodeling.

15:33.017 --> 15:35.452
These nails
were torn away

15:35.486 --> 15:37.888
at least 15 years ago.
Bent back and torn out.

15:37.922 --> 15:39.623
From clawing at something.

15:39.657 --> 15:41.625
Stephanie might have
been the one who was

15:41.659 --> 15:42.993
locked in that stable.

15:43.027 --> 15:44.427
It was her.

15:44.462 --> 15:45.929
The nail fragment you found

15:45.963 --> 15:47.898
in the wood of the stable door
matches Stephanie

15:47.932 --> 15:49.599
McNamara's DNA.
What about

15:49.634 --> 15:51.902
the other nails
Dr. Hodgins found?

15:51.936 --> 15:53.336
None of the DNA
matches Stephanie.

15:53.371 --> 15:55.038
I'm going through
the nails now,

15:55.072 --> 15:57.007
to see if I can find any matches.
So, the Ghost Killer might

15:57.041 --> 16:01.511
have glued the nails from her
other victims onto Stephanie.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.680
But why?

16:08.052 --> 16:08.998
The SEC?

16:09.023 --> 16:10.553
Yeah. The McNamaras
had billions.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.422
I want to know who benefits
from Stephanie's murder.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.190
The Ghost Killer doesn't
care about money, Booth.

16:14.225 --> 16:15.625
She's fulfilling
an emotional need,

16:15.660 --> 16:17.327
not a financial one.

16:17.361 --> 16:18.929
What if the gardener killed her?
Wouldn't that give you both?

16:18.963 --> 16:20.764
None of the other victims
fit the money profile.

16:20.798 --> 16:22.265
Lana Brewster,
Chloe Campbell--

16:22.300 --> 16:23.967
neither one was rich.
I don't care, okay?

16:24.001 --> 16:25.936
When it comes to fortunes
like the McNamaras', okay,

16:25.970 --> 16:28.305
murders like this--
it's always about the money.

16:30.041 --> 16:33.043
<i>I'm still not</i>
<i>entirely clear on</i>

16:33.077 --> 16:34.277
how the SEC can assist with

16:34.312 --> 16:36.046
a murder investigation,
Agent Booth.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.647
Oh, the McNamaras--
they have been investigated

16:37.682 --> 16:39.115
by you in the past.

16:39.150 --> 16:40.483
Eight times to be exact.

16:40.518 --> 16:42.485
Eight.
Those cases are sealed.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.354
As are the
settlements we reached.

16:44.388 --> 16:45.922
I know there's always a turf war

16:45.957 --> 16:48.091
between agencies.
Just remember,

16:48.125 --> 16:49.826
we're gonna win this one.
So why don't you be

16:49.860 --> 16:51.895
a good girl and help?
I can tell you that the

16:51.929 --> 16:53.430
formal investigations launched

16:53.464 --> 16:55.298
over the last 18 years
have included allegations

16:55.333 --> 16:56.833
of insider trading,
accounting fraud,

16:56.867 --> 16:59.369
market manipulation
and disclosure violations.

16:59.403 --> 17:01.171
One of those cases involved

17:01.205 --> 17:05.241
$132 million in tax violations
and missing funds.

17:05.276 --> 17:07.444
But you didn't recommend
prison time.

17:07.478 --> 17:10.523
As a prosecutor, that makes me
want to slap someone silly.

17:10.549 --> 17:12.301
The responsible entity
received a cease-and-desist

17:12.346 --> 17:13.182
and paid a fine.

17:13.183 --> 17:15.184
Wait a second. Entity.

17:15.218 --> 17:18.186
Okay, Giles McNamara is an entity now?
We try to avoid prosecutions.

17:18.221 --> 17:19.855
They're time-consuming
and difficult to prove.

17:19.888 --> 17:22.223
Well, it didn't
take us long to prove

17:22.258 --> 17:23.625
that McNamara used one
of his shell companies

17:23.660 --> 17:25.060
to pay off a medical examiner

17:25.095 --> 17:26.762
in the tune of, what,
two million dollars?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.131
In the Madoff case,
we were looking

17:29.165 --> 17:31.000
at missing funds in
excess of $65 billion,

17:31.034 --> 17:34.503
so excuse me if two million
didn't raise a red flag.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.905
We're going to need
access to the McNamara

17:36.940 --> 17:39.742
financials
over the past 18 years.

17:39.776 --> 17:42.177
Corporate filings,
disclosure documents,

17:42.212 --> 17:44.513
regulatory examination
reports, penalties...

17:44.547 --> 17:49.418
That is all confidential,
proprietary information.

17:49.452 --> 17:51.854
I would like to help, but...
All right, you know what?

17:51.888 --> 17:53.756
You really don't want to
push me right now, Ms. Kent,

17:53.790 --> 17:55.157
'cause I will
get Ms. Julian here

17:55.191 --> 17:57.659
to get the DOJ to issue
a warrant to put you

17:57.694 --> 18:00.929
in jail for impeding
a murder investigation.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.738
See how easy that was, <i>cherie?</i>

18:15.578 --> 18:17.212
Hey.
Hey.

18:17.247 --> 18:20.149
Booth and Caroline
forced the SEC

18:20.183 --> 18:22.017
to send over their
investigations

18:22.052 --> 18:23.652
of McNamara and his
holding companies,

18:23.686 --> 18:27.289
his offshore entities, the works.
That's great.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.358
Well, there's three
hard drives worth.

18:29.392 --> 18:33.395
There's over a million and a
half pages covering 18 years.

18:33.430 --> 18:35.731
It just feels like we're
being buried in paperwork.

18:35.765 --> 18:37.433
So show 'em you can't be buried.

18:37.467 --> 18:40.536
Hey, I may have found a link
to the gardener for Booth.

18:40.570 --> 18:42.004
So, look at this.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.572
I found phosphorous, nitrates,

18:43.606 --> 18:47.042
<i>chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium,</i>
Flumetralin,

18:47.077 --> 18:48.410
as well as organochlorides.

18:48.445 --> 18:49.945
Oh, I know that one!

18:49.979 --> 18:51.380
It's a pesticide.

18:51.414 --> 18:53.248
I use it for our vegetables.
Yeah.

18:53.283 --> 18:55.350
That's right. Well, Stephanie
actually had it on her clothes,

18:55.385 --> 18:58.053
so, it's enough for a search
warrant to match the chemicals

18:58.088 --> 19:00.155
that the gardener uses as well
as any potential weapons

19:00.190 --> 19:01.690
that Steph was stabbed with.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.593
Well, but couldn't Stephanie
just have had that stuff

19:04.627 --> 19:05.689
on her clothes just by
being on the estate?

19:05.690 --> 19:08.482
Yes.. Yes, but the Flumetralin
and the pesticide

19:08.483 --> 19:10.551
was inside the stab wounds
that I swabbed.

19:10.585 --> 19:13.120
They were on the murder weapon.

19:15.090 --> 19:16.824
It's always the help, right?

19:16.858 --> 19:18.259
The butler did it?

19:18.293 --> 19:20.594
We found trace
of the Flumetralin you use

19:20.629 --> 19:21.962
within Stephanie's injuries.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.430
"Flumetramin." Right.
What?

19:23.465 --> 19:25.032
Right. Translation is,
you stabbed her

19:25.066 --> 19:27.301
- with your gardening tool.
- My colleagues at

19:27.335 --> 19:29.303
the Jeffersonian are
testing your tools now.

19:29.337 --> 19:32.806
Can you turn your head
to the side, please?

19:32.841 --> 19:34.441
What? No.

19:34.476 --> 19:35.776
Okay.

19:37.746 --> 19:40.514
I didn't kill Stephanie.

19:40.548 --> 19:41.982
I grew up on the estate.

19:42.017 --> 19:44.184
Stephanie and I played
together as kids.

19:44.219 --> 19:45.486
What is she doing?

19:45.520 --> 19:46.587
I don't know, but, uh,

19:46.621 --> 19:48.155
you know,
if you have nothing to hide,

19:48.189 --> 19:49.590
why would you be nervous?
Why would I kill her?

19:49.624 --> 19:51.225
The McNamaras were good to me.

19:51.259 --> 19:52.860
Even if the estate sold,

19:52.894 --> 19:55.796
I still have a pension
and severance package.

19:55.830 --> 19:57.164
Maybe you felt you
deserved more.

19:57.198 --> 19:58.599
May I feel
your mandible?

19:58.633 --> 20:00.534
It'll just
take a second.

20:00.568 --> 20:01.835
Do I have to?

20:01.870 --> 20:03.837
I would.

20:03.872 --> 20:05.939
Fine.

20:13.715 --> 20:14.748
Hmm.

20:14.783 --> 20:16.950
You felt you deserved more

20:16.985 --> 20:18.852
because
you're Stephanie's sister.

20:18.887 --> 20:20.154
What?

20:20.188 --> 20:22.156
What?
Half-sister probably,

20:22.190 --> 20:23.724
but she has the same
slight prognathism

20:23.758 --> 20:25.025
as Stephanie, although

20:25.060 --> 20:26.760
hers was more prominent.

20:26.795 --> 20:28.228
She's a McNamara?

20:28.263 --> 20:30.064
Yes. I am sure
that a DNA test will prove

20:30.098 --> 20:31.732
that Giles McNamara
was her father.

20:31.766 --> 20:35.169
What? You're wrong and crazy.

20:35.203 --> 20:37.604
I assure you I am neither.
I wouldn't call her wrong and crazy.

20:37.639 --> 20:39.206
And it was common knowledge

20:39.240 --> 20:40.574
that Giles McNamara
wasn't a faithful husband.

20:40.608 --> 20:41.975
And your mother
worked on the estate.

20:42.010 --> 20:43.644
Why don't you
do the math?

20:43.678 --> 20:45.512
As the last
McNamara left alive,

20:45.547 --> 20:47.247
even as an illegitimate one,

20:47.282 --> 20:49.516
you stand to inherit
a significant amount of money.

20:49.551 --> 20:51.251
Billions of
dollars, Bones.

20:51.286 --> 20:53.527
Billions of reasons why you
would want to kill Stephanie.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.658
I ran the DNA
on each individual nail

20:57.692 --> 20:59.960
that was glued on Stephanie.
Mm-hmm.

20:59.994 --> 21:01.528
You were right.

21:01.563 --> 21:03.230
They match all the other victims
you identified.

21:03.264 --> 21:05.799
Chloe Campbell,
Lana Brewster, Carla Hopkins,

21:05.834 --> 21:08.369
Timothy Monroe, Michael Windsor,
Heather Mendez,

21:08.403 --> 21:10.637
Alex Webber and Trent McNamara.
And since Stephanie

21:10.672 --> 21:12.973
was wearing Trent's nail,
I can confirm that Trent <i>is</i>

21:13.007 --> 21:15.676
one of the victims of the Ghost Killer.
And the gardener

21:15.710 --> 21:17.077
would have had contact
with Lana Brewster,

21:17.112 --> 21:18.846
Trent and Stephanie.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.115
We should have her check the
other victims to determine...

21:21.149 --> 21:22.649
Angela already has.

21:23.718 --> 21:26.019
Hey, so, these
are the locations

21:26.054 --> 21:28.288
where each of the Ghost Killer
victims were murdered.

21:28.323 --> 21:31.125
Once Cam got me the names,
I was able to create

21:31.159 --> 21:33.794
a timeline of who was killed
where and when.

21:33.828 --> 21:35.095
The McNamara family

21:35.130 --> 21:36.697
expense accounts and
travel records

21:36.731 --> 21:38.832
were on the hard drives
the SEC sent over.

21:38.867 --> 21:40.334
I was able
to place Stephanie

21:40.368 --> 21:43.971
- at each of the murder sites.
- Stephanie?

21:44.005 --> 21:45.406
Yeah.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.408
Heather Mendez, California,
November 2004.

21:47.442 --> 21:49.777
Stephanie was
in Los Angeles

21:49.811 --> 21:51.478
hosting a McNamara Foundation

21:51.513 --> 21:52.780
charity event.

21:52.814 --> 21:54.581
Timothy Monroe,
Texas, May 2012.

21:54.616 --> 21:56.583
Stephanie was in town
for the wedding

21:56.618 --> 21:58.252
of her college roommate.

21:58.286 --> 22:01.755
So Stephanie put
those nails on herself.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.056
Stephanie McNamara

22:03.091 --> 22:05.092
<i>was</i> the Ghost Killer.

22:05.126 --> 22:07.928
But who killed Stephanie?

22:09.951 --> 22:12.557
The McNamaras are American
royalty, for God's sake.

22:12.558 --> 22:14.559
I mean, so what the hell
prompts a princess

22:14.593 --> 22:17.061
to go on a killing spree?
Her father's megalomania,

22:17.096 --> 22:18.930
for one thing.
Giles McNamara had

22:18.964 --> 22:21.199
a pathological need
to dominate and control

22:21.233 --> 22:23.762
every aspect of his life,
including his family.

22:23.787 --> 22:24.502
We found DNA

22:24.503 --> 22:26.271
and blood evidence
that indicates

22:26.305 --> 22:28.306
that Stephanie McNamara
was abused as a girl.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.642
When we pressed the
gardener, she admitted

22:30.676 --> 22:33.211
that McNamara used to lock
his daughter in the tack room

22:33.245 --> 22:34.813
if she did anything wrong.
And Stephanie

22:34.847 --> 22:37.882
- tried to claw her way out.
- Poor child

22:37.917 --> 22:39.189
tore her nails up so badly

22:39.214 --> 22:41.286
that eventually she had
none left, to speak of.

22:41.287 --> 22:43.721
Which is why she took
the fingernails from her victims.

22:43.756 --> 22:45.957
Symbolically,
she was replacing

22:45.991 --> 22:48.493
something that she felt
her father had stolen from her.

22:48.527 --> 22:50.328
But you still have one nail
you haven't I.D.'d.

22:50.362 --> 22:51.896
We're working on it now.
Yes, and we have

22:51.931 --> 22:53.765
to assume it's another victim
we don't know about.

22:53.799 --> 22:56.768
My God.
And through all of this,

22:56.802 --> 22:59.037
no one at the McNamara estate
ever called in the abuse

22:59.071 --> 22:59.965
to the authorities?

22:59.990 --> 23:01.739
The gardener was
around Stephanie's age.

23:01.740 --> 23:04.742
She probably thought if she
said anything, she'd be next.

23:04.777 --> 23:07.011
So far this half sister's
our best suspect, though?

23:07.046 --> 23:07.946
Yes, sir.

23:08.948 --> 23:10.448
The whole damn country believes

23:10.482 --> 23:11.983
the government lets people

23:12.017 --> 23:13.451
like the McNamaras
get away with murder,

23:13.485 --> 23:16.321
and for the past
18 years, we have.

23:16.355 --> 23:18.423
I want this put to bed, Booth.

23:18.457 --> 23:20.124
I want convictions.

23:20.159 --> 23:21.626
No loose ends.

23:21.660 --> 23:22.594
Yes, sir.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.069
So, I was compiling the results
from the pollen and particulates

23:31.103 --> 23:32.024
I found on Stephanie...

23:32.027 --> 23:33.671
To match them to what's grown
on the McNamara estate.

23:33.672 --> 23:36.541
Yeah, but in the stab wound,
I found traces of <i>Nicotiana tobacum.</i>

23:36.575 --> 23:38.757
Tobacco? Wait a minute,
wasn't Stephanie a smoker?

23:38.758 --> 23:40.518
Well, she was,
but there was no other tobacco

23:40.528 --> 23:42.077
or traces of cigarettes
found on her.

23:42.078 --> 23:43.661
So why is there tobacco
residue on the murder weapon?

23:43.662 --> 23:45.229
I don't know, I don't know.
I'm gonna run everything

23:45.263 --> 23:46.464
through the mass spec again,
see if I missed something.

23:46.498 --> 23:47.932
The last fingernail

23:47.966 --> 23:51.268
gave me a DNA match
on the unknown victim--

23:51.303 --> 23:53.004
Maya Zinkow.

23:53.038 --> 23:56.107
15 years old. Died 20 years ago.
Well, that's by far

23:56.141 --> 23:57.908
- the youngest victim.
- Wait a minute.

23:57.943 --> 24:00.044
Maya Zinkow?
Well, she lived in the same town

24:00.078 --> 24:01.245
that Stephanie and I grew up in.

24:01.279 --> 24:03.147
I mean, they were classmates.

24:03.181 --> 24:04.993
Apparently, the murderer was
found and convicted.

24:04.994 --> 24:06.661
Well, yeah. He was a teacher
at the school; I remember this.

24:07.185 --> 24:08.686
I mean, everyone said
he was the nicest guy.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.588
Well, he might have been.
Dr. Brennan's

24:10.622 --> 24:13.858
having Maya's exhumed so she can
link Stephanie to the murder.

24:13.892 --> 24:15.960
You mean she started
killing at 15?

24:15.994 --> 24:17.995
I guess she was a prodigy.

24:23.502 --> 24:26.103
Dr. Herman Kessler--
served 20 years

24:26.138 --> 24:27.772
for killing that girl.

24:27.806 --> 24:30.408
He was her biology teacher.
No prior record.

24:30.442 --> 24:33.711
He was accused of rape, too.
No, that wasn't proven.

24:33.745 --> 24:36.881
It only took the jury
four hours to find him guilty.

24:36.915 --> 24:39.517
No juror wants to be responsible
for letting a monster go free.

24:39.551 --> 24:40.951
Kessler was released
six months ago.

24:40.986 --> 24:42.853
It sounds like he
had good reason

24:42.888 --> 24:44.722
to want revenge
against the person that actually

24:44.756 --> 24:46.150
committed the crime.

24:46.175 --> 24:47.691
So he killed
Stephanie McNamara

24:47.692 --> 24:49.827
to set the
record straight.

24:49.861 --> 24:51.395
But how did Kessler
know that Stephanie

24:51.430 --> 24:53.330
killed this girl?
We just found out ourselves.

24:53.365 --> 24:55.800
Well, it looks like
the casket's made of wood.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.835
Depending on how it's sealed,
we may have

24:57.869 --> 25:00.938
a viable set of remains
that could give us answers.

25:00.972 --> 25:02.273
Pull that bolt
out of there.

25:02.307 --> 25:04.175
Hang on, there's one more.

25:04.209 --> 25:05.476
All right.

25:09.381 --> 25:11.215
Mummified,
so she wasn't embalmed.

25:11.249 --> 25:12.983
I might be able to get

25:13.018 --> 25:15.286
tox results from the tissue.
These injuries

25:15.320 --> 25:17.688
seem to be stab wounds--
violent,

25:17.722 --> 25:20.624
like the wounds on Stephanie.
Bones, are you satisfied

25:20.659 --> 25:22.259
that this is, uh, Maya Zinkow?

25:22.294 --> 25:24.195
There's an excellent chance.

25:24.229 --> 25:26.897
All right, let's
get her back to the lab, ASAP.

25:26.932 --> 25:28.365
Um, is Caroline having

25:28.400 --> 25:30.034
the medical examiner's
report sent over?

25:30.068 --> 25:31.869
It's gonna be at your office
when you get back.

25:31.903 --> 25:34.705
I'm gonna get Sweets;
we'll try and locate Kessler.

25:38.143 --> 25:39.777
The M.E. report indicates

25:39.811 --> 25:41.745
that the victim was placed
inside the casket

25:41.780 --> 25:46.083
at the coroner's office and then
taken straight to the cemetery.

25:46.118 --> 25:48.452
Explains why
she wasn't embalmed.

25:48.487 --> 25:50.387
But it raises more questions
than it answers.

25:50.422 --> 25:52.056
Standard procedure
is to release the remains

25:52.090 --> 25:55.192
to the family and have them
go through a funeral home.

25:55.227 --> 25:57.194
None of the stab wounds
have been catalogued.

25:57.229 --> 26:01.132
Just the injuries
to the C3 and the clavicle.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.534
Well, even cursory looks
indicate that there's

26:03.568 --> 26:05.970
12, 13, 14 wounds
to the ribs, sternum...

26:06.004 --> 26:08.606
As well as the avulsion fracture
where her fingernail

26:08.640 --> 26:10.908
was ripped off.
These look like

26:10.942 --> 26:13.677
almost the same injuries
we found on Stephanie McNamara.

26:13.712 --> 26:16.113
This report is as incompetent
as any I've seen.

26:16.148 --> 26:19.049
Who would sign off
on a job like...

26:19.084 --> 26:20.417
Oh, God.

26:20.452 --> 26:22.086
What?

26:22.120 --> 26:25.256
'Cause that sounded
like a bad "Oh, God."

26:25.290 --> 26:27.992
The M.E. who signed off
on Maya's autopsy,

26:28.026 --> 26:30.661
it's the same one who worked
on Lana Brewster's body.

26:30.695 --> 26:32.630
The one Giles McNamara paid off.

26:32.664 --> 26:35.132
Could he have known that
his daughter was killing

26:35.167 --> 26:37.334
all these people and not done
anything about it?

26:37.369 --> 26:39.470
Oh, God.

26:39.504 --> 26:43.307
How did Kessler get
this information?

26:49.814 --> 26:52.116
Like I said, I haven't seen
Kessler in awhile.

26:52.150 --> 26:53.551
What's "awhile"?

26:53.585 --> 26:55.953
Four or five days.
Could be longer.

26:55.987 --> 26:59.456
Kessler, he's a quiet one.

27:01.193 --> 27:03.327
Isn't that what they always say
about psycho killers,

27:03.361 --> 27:04.628
"He was a real quiet one"?

27:04.663 --> 27:07.164
Nobody said anything
about a killer, sir.

27:07.199 --> 27:08.532
I read the papers.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.000
So what are we looking at here?

27:10.035 --> 27:11.902
It's gruesome, right?
Like, Dahmer gruesome?

27:11.937 --> 27:12.937
Just open the door.

27:12.971 --> 27:14.271
Give me one detail.
Something juicy.

27:14.306 --> 27:16.006
Now, look, you're familiar
with the term

27:16.041 --> 27:17.274
"obstruction of justice"?

27:17.309 --> 27:20.511
Feds, you're always such
hard-asses.

27:20.545 --> 27:21.912
Okay, take care.

27:28.386 --> 27:30.321
Hmm.

27:30.355 --> 27:33.324
File boxes
and nothing else.

27:33.358 --> 27:34.992
No personal effects.

27:35.026 --> 27:36.594
He really did not care

27:36.628 --> 27:38.262
about building
a life after prison.

27:38.296 --> 27:39.563
Look at this, huh?

27:39.598 --> 27:41.865
Information
about McNamara.

27:44.569 --> 27:48.973
Hmm... It's like he made a hobby
collecting stuff about him.

27:49.007 --> 27:50.241
I'd say...

27:50.275 --> 27:52.476
it's safe to call it
an obsession.

27:52.510 --> 27:54.245
Obsession? I bet
all these boxes are full

27:54.279 --> 27:55.646
of stuff about McNamara.

27:57.048 --> 27:58.415
Look at this.

27:58.450 --> 28:01.085
What do those
blueprints say?

28:01.119 --> 28:04.321
The McNamaras' estate.

28:04.356 --> 28:06.457
Oh, my G...
So Kessler used that

28:06.491 --> 28:09.460
to plan Stephanie's
abduction.

28:09.494 --> 28:12.396
What about
that other set?

28:12.430 --> 28:14.698
This is from another house.

28:14.733 --> 28:16.934
Kessler's going after
someone else.

28:19.671 --> 28:21.502
So, Angela's looking through
the Hall of Records

28:21.503 --> 28:23.550
for a house that matches
the second set of blueprints.

28:23.551 --> 28:25.352
Yeah, we now know that most
of this was obtained

28:25.386 --> 28:26.486
while he was in prison.

28:26.521 --> 28:28.522
He planned on
filing an appeal,

28:28.556 --> 28:30.257
so that gave him access
to everything

28:30.291 --> 28:31.625
even remotely related
to the case.

28:31.659 --> 28:33.527
He never filed for an appeal.

28:33.561 --> 28:35.629
Yeah, that's 'cause it was
never about exoneration.

28:35.663 --> 28:37.330
It was always about revenge.
You're saying

28:37.365 --> 28:40.000
that he knew the McNamaras were
involved this whole time?

28:40.034 --> 28:41.802
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

28:41.836 --> 28:44.037
Kessler knew that he couldn't
fight someone as powerful

28:44.072 --> 28:45.539
as them in court.

28:45.573 --> 28:47.307
So the man
spent 20 years in prison

28:47.341 --> 28:48.742
finding a way
to even the score.

28:48.776 --> 28:50.444
In his mind,
it was the only way

28:50.478 --> 28:52.712
he could get justice--
but here's our biggest find.

28:52.747 --> 28:55.115
Those are the crime scene
photos of Maya Zinkow.

28:55.149 --> 28:57.684
Wait a second.
I thought these never existed.

28:57.718 --> 28:58.885
According to
the local police

28:58.920 --> 29:00.654
and the FBI,
they don't exist.

29:00.688 --> 29:03.890
Something about the original
negatives being "damaged."

29:03.925 --> 29:06.075
I can only assume
someone was trying to bury them

29:06.076 --> 29:06.837
for McNamara.

29:06.838 --> 29:09.396
McNamara must have someone
working on the inside.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.031
But how did
Kessler get them?

29:11.066 --> 29:13.267
You devote every waking hour
for 20 years,

29:13.301 --> 29:14.735
you uncover a lot.

29:14.769 --> 29:17.771
Yeah, well, I want to know
who hid all this stuff.

29:17.806 --> 29:19.573
The bone defects
on the distal ends

29:19.607 --> 29:22.825
of the right radius
and ulna suggest

29:22.826 --> 29:26.729
the implement entered with
a left-to-right trajectory.

29:26.764 --> 29:28.364
I'm noticing the same thing

29:28.399 --> 29:31.935
on the anterior surface
of the manubrium.

29:31.969 --> 29:34.437
The directionality
on the report showed

29:34.471 --> 29:36.573
a right-to-left trajectory.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.675
We could go through
this all day.

29:38.709 --> 29:40.577
The M.E.'s report
is a complete fiction.

29:40.611 --> 29:42.879
It was clearly written
to set up Kessler.

29:42.913 --> 29:45.181
Yes, but what's most interesting
is what's left out.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.346
Stephanie McNamara's wounds
mirror almost exactly

29:47.347 --> 29:49.589
the wounds suffered
by Maya Zinkow.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.591
And as far as we know,
Kessler's the only one

29:51.625 --> 29:52.926
that had access to these photos.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.360
Which leaves little doubt

29:54.395 --> 29:56.262
that Kessler killed
Stephanie McNamara.

29:56.297 --> 29:58.298
There was a rape charge in here.

29:58.332 --> 29:59.699
Yeah, the charge was dropped.

29:59.733 --> 30:01.401
Because they didn't want
the body to be examined.

30:01.435 --> 30:03.970
The flesh is desiccated,
but I found some evidence

30:04.004 --> 30:05.672
of damage to the cervix,

30:05.706 --> 30:09.075
and microscopic sections show

30:09.110 --> 30:11.211
associated tissue disruption
and hemorrhaging

30:11.245 --> 30:12.979
which is consistent
with having been raped.

30:13.013 --> 30:14.547
There was no rape kit
in evidence.

30:14.582 --> 30:16.149
And how would Stephanie
be involved?

30:16.183 --> 30:17.584
I mean, she certainly
didn't rape Maya

30:17.618 --> 30:18.651
before killing her.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.253
Well, it appears
that someone did.

30:20.287 --> 30:23.256
You're going to retrieve
a sample from the victim?

30:23.290 --> 30:24.757
It's been 20 years.

30:24.792 --> 30:27.794
Seminal DNA yielding
a complete pattern

30:27.828 --> 30:29.929
after 20 years of decomp
is a long shot,

30:29.964 --> 30:31.364
but it's not impossible.

30:31.398 --> 30:33.299
And we don't have
any other options.

30:33.334 --> 30:34.767
Hey, Cam,

30:34.802 --> 30:35.802
I think I found something

30:35.836 --> 30:37.070
that you might want to see.

30:37.104 --> 30:39.305
I'd been searching
the Hall of Records

30:39.340 --> 30:41.441
and Building
and Safety for DC

30:41.475 --> 30:44.777
and Maryland,
Virginia, and Delaware,

30:44.812 --> 30:47.313
and I finally found
a match

30:47.348 --> 30:49.082
for the blueprints
Booth sent over.

30:49.116 --> 30:51.251
515 North Alfred
Street, Arlington, Virginia.

30:51.285 --> 30:52.252
Who lives there?

30:52.286 --> 30:53.720
Congressman Steven Palter.

30:53.754 --> 30:55.388
Why would Kessler be going

30:55.422 --> 30:56.623
after a congressman?

30:56.657 --> 30:57.824
<i>Turns out</i>
<i>that Congressman Palter</i>

30:57.858 --> 30:58.958
used to be Judge Palter.

30:58.993 --> 31:00.894
He presided over
the Maya Zinkow case.

31:00.928 --> 31:03.766
Two years later, the McNamaras
helped fund congressional campaign.

31:03.767 --> 31:05.068
Uh-huh-- through
shell companies.

31:05.102 --> 31:06.836
Of course it was
through shell companies.

31:06.870 --> 31:10.607
Cam got a viable semen sample
from Maya Zinkow's remains

31:10.641 --> 31:12.075
and she got a DNA match.

31:12.109 --> 31:14.077
Well, I'm guessing
it's not Kessler.

31:14.111 --> 31:16.346
No, it was Giles McNamara.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.548
Stephanie's father raped
Maya Zinkow?

31:18.582 --> 31:21.317
Wait-- why would Stephanie
want to kill Maya?

31:21.352 --> 31:22.885
It's sick, but the victimology

31:22.920 --> 31:24.621
makes perfect sense.
Stephanie had

31:24.655 --> 31:26.322
an abusive relationship
with her father, right? - Right.

31:26.357 --> 31:29.392
She would do anything
to gain his attention.

31:29.426 --> 31:32.895
So... she was jealous
that he raped someone?

31:32.930 --> 31:35.565
Right. To her, someone else was
getting her father's attention.

31:35.599 --> 31:37.533
It could've easily triggered
a psychotic break,

31:37.568 --> 31:40.136
leading to the first murder.
Right, and McNamara

31:40.170 --> 31:42.572
paid off the M.E. and the judge
to make all this go away.

31:42.606 --> 31:44.374
Yeah, except he didn't care
about protecting Stephanie,

31:44.408 --> 31:45.642
only himself.

31:45.676 --> 31:47.310
No wonder
Kessler wants revenge.

31:47.344 --> 31:49.746
Congressman, uh,
Palter is next in line.

31:49.780 --> 31:52.682
Tell Stark, will you?
Okay.

31:52.716 --> 31:54.601
<i>Geez!</i>
<i>There's no answer at Palter's.</i>

31:54.602 --> 31:56.436
I hope he's out playing poker
or something.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.470
How did the Deputy Director
react when you told him

31:58.472 --> 32:00.240
that there might be someone
at the FBI

32:00.274 --> 32:02.141
who protected McNamara?
Well, he wasn't surprised,

32:02.176 --> 32:03.676
which was surprising.

32:03.711 --> 32:05.378
But he gave me a blank check.
Told me to find out

32:05.412 --> 32:06.846
who was behind it.
Whoever it is

32:06.881 --> 32:08.448
let nine people die.

32:19.827 --> 32:22.795
Looks like a struggle.

32:28.202 --> 32:29.702
Locked.

32:29.737 --> 32:31.237
Booth?
Yeah.

32:33.407 --> 32:35.542
All right, stand back, will you?

32:54.204 --> 32:56.272
So any particulates
from the weapon

32:56.306 --> 32:58.741
will be on the shirt
as well as on the wounds.

32:58.775 --> 33:01.043
The left external
carotid was severed.

33:01.077 --> 33:03.445
Yeah, after he was stabbed
in the chest and spine.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.414
Well, Kessler clearly wanted him
to suffer.

33:05.448 --> 33:06.982
There are
clean incisions

33:07.017 --> 33:09.919
in the third costal cartilage
as well as the clavicle.

33:09.953 --> 33:11.253
And C3.

33:11.288 --> 33:12.655
One long slash
from the neck,

33:12.689 --> 33:14.857
across the chest
to the abdomen.

33:14.891 --> 33:17.693
I see a total
of 16 wounds.

33:17.727 --> 33:20.663
It's the same number we saw
on Maya Zinkow and Stephanie.

33:20.697 --> 33:23.632
More vengeance
from Kessler.

33:25.135 --> 33:27.503
This wound track is
deeper and more definitive

33:27.537 --> 33:29.638
than anything we ever
saw on Stephanie.

33:29.673 --> 33:31.273
Dr. Hodgins,
can you swab the wound?

33:31.308 --> 33:33.042
Then Clark can make a mold.

33:33.076 --> 33:36.178
I'm not done examining the...
We don't have the time.

33:36.213 --> 33:38.848
Finally getting a weapon I.D.
could lead us to Kessler.

33:38.882 --> 33:40.850
Okay, I'll cut away
the tissue.

33:54.698 --> 33:56.732
<i>You were supposed</i>
<i>to handle this, Booth.</i>

33:56.766 --> 33:58.801
Now I got a dead congressman
on my hands.

33:58.835 --> 34:00.769
Look, I'm willing to take
full responsibility, sir,

34:00.804 --> 34:02.208
but I'm more concerned
about who's next.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.005
Next?

34:03.006 --> 34:04.440
You got to be kidding me.
If Kessler

34:04.474 --> 34:07.576
sees this as a conspiracy...
Which it is.

34:07.611 --> 34:09.812
You don't know that, Ms. Julian.
McNamara gets away

34:09.846 --> 34:11.981
with paying off a judge
and a medical examiner

34:12.014 --> 34:13.449
to protect his daughter,

34:13.483 --> 34:15.284
frames Kessler
for murder,

34:15.318 --> 34:16.819
he escapes prosecution
by the SEC,

34:16.853 --> 34:18.654
somehow he gets the FBI

34:18.688 --> 34:20.822
to lose vital pieces
of evidence.

34:20.857 --> 34:23.726
Do I have to go on, sir?
Because I think I'm on a roll.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.094
You really think this Kessler
guy is gonna kill again?

34:26.129 --> 34:27.132
We have to assume that, sir.

34:27.158 --> 34:29.531
I've been through almost
1,000 pages Kessler compiled

34:29.532 --> 34:31.600
on the murder case,
as well as McNamara's

34:31.635 --> 34:33.502
business dealings, all right?
Kessler suffers

34:33.536 --> 34:35.616
from post-traumatic embitterment
disorder, dysthymia,

34:35.639 --> 34:37.806
as well as a comorbidity...
Okay, okay,

34:37.841 --> 34:40.074
the guy's a sick bastard--
I get it.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.244
Who's next on his list?

34:42.279 --> 34:44.146
No idea, sir.
We're trying to find him.

34:45.581 --> 34:47.850
And?
Well...

34:47.884 --> 34:50.819
he's too smart to run, so he's
got to be hiding someplace.

34:50.853 --> 34:52.855
I'm guessing you have no idea
where that is.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.822
No. Which is why we should
get back to work.

34:54.858 --> 34:57.559
Then go. Get the hell out
of here before Congress hangs me

34:57.594 --> 34:59.728
from the Capitol Building.

35:04.334 --> 35:06.936
You wanted to see me, Dr. Hodgins?
Yeah, more tobacco, Dr. B.

35:06.970 --> 35:08.737
It was in the wound

35:08.772 --> 35:10.419
and on his shirt
where it was cut by the weapon.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.621
Was he a smoker like Stephanie?
No, as a matter of fact,

35:13.043 --> 35:14.803
his last piece of legislation
was an increase

35:14.811 --> 35:16.445
in the tobacco tax.

35:16.479 --> 35:18.847
So the tobacco was transferred
from the murder weapon.

35:18.882 --> 35:20.516
No other explanation.

35:20.550 --> 35:24.219
I'm also seeing methoxychlor.
It's a pesticide.

35:24.254 --> 35:26.789
Something the gardener used?
No, methoxychlor was banned.

35:26.823 --> 35:28.691
It hasn't been used in decades,
so... Hey, any luck

35:28.725 --> 35:30.859
with the murder weapon?
The mold gave us kerf marks

35:30.894 --> 35:33.062
on the blade-- they're
bent and irregular.

35:33.096 --> 35:35.130
The weapon seems
to be quite old.

35:35.165 --> 35:36.765
Well, that would explain
the pesticide.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.434
All right, I got to get back
to work-- I'm also seeing

35:38.468 --> 35:40.869
some fibers embedded
in the wound that might help us.

35:40.904 --> 35:43.572
I'm doing MRI scans
on both sets of remains.

35:43.606 --> 35:45.407
We don't have time to clean
the congressman's bones,

35:45.442 --> 35:48.210
but this should give us
a clear view of the damage done

35:48.244 --> 35:50.546
to both victims.

35:52.015 --> 35:53.749
Kessler had more
information than the FBI.

35:53.783 --> 35:55.384
All right, look,
McNamara might be dead

35:55.418 --> 35:57.219
but whoever protected him
could still be alive.

35:57.253 --> 35:59.154
Unless that's who Kessler's
going after next.

35:59.189 --> 36:01.323
I want to know who McNamara bought.
From all the information

36:01.358 --> 36:03.359
Kessler got, he knows.
Look, Stephanie

36:03.393 --> 36:05.094
and Palter were killed within
ten miles of each other,

36:05.128 --> 36:06.762
so he should be close.
I agree.

36:06.796 --> 36:09.465
He's revisiting the scene
of the crime, reliving it.

36:09.499 --> 36:12.167
Rewriting it, actually, so it comes out
the way he feels it should.

36:12.202 --> 36:13.702
So you're saying
that he's home.

36:13.737 --> 36:16.772
Psychologically, yeah.

36:16.806 --> 36:18.741
These "V" nicks on Stephanie's
third and fourth ribs,

36:18.775 --> 36:20.209
if we measure
the intercostal space,

36:20.243 --> 36:21.844
the distance between the ribs...

36:21.878 --> 36:24.279
It'll give us the width
of the blade.

36:26.416 --> 36:28.951
4.19 centimeters.

36:28.985 --> 36:31.420
Now the striation on
the right anterolateral surface

36:31.454 --> 36:33.288
of the body,
on the sixth thoracic vertebra.

36:33.323 --> 36:36.658
So the length of the blade
would have been

36:36.693 --> 36:38.293
20 centimeters.

36:38.328 --> 36:40.763
Please rotate
Stephanie's torso.

36:40.797 --> 36:43.132
The scrape
on the posterior aspect

36:43.166 --> 36:46.335
of the fourth sternal rib seems
to have been caused by trying

36:46.369 --> 36:48.270
to extract something
with a hooked end.

36:48.304 --> 36:50.506
As if caught and then
someone turned it.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.774
I see where you're going.

36:51.808 --> 36:53.108
The width of that scrape

36:53.143 --> 36:55.110
could give us
the size of the hook.

36:56.846 --> 36:58.286
Can you see
if the same kind

36:58.314 --> 36:59.982
of hooked blade was used
on the congressman?

37:00.016 --> 37:02.351
Yeah, give me a second.

37:05.722 --> 37:07.056
They're an exact match.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.324
He used the same blade
on both of them.

37:09.359 --> 37:11.960
Asbestos.
The fibers were asbestos.

37:11.995 --> 37:12.995
Tell us why you're happy.

37:12.996 --> 37:14.496
Oh, I understand.

37:14.531 --> 37:16.065
I am also happy.

37:16.099 --> 37:18.167
Okay. now this is not fair.
Tobacco, asbestos

37:18.201 --> 37:19.802
and a banned pesticide.

37:19.836 --> 37:21.804
Well, asbestos was also
banned in the '50s.

37:21.838 --> 37:23.305
It was used in the manufacture
of cigarette filters,

37:23.339 --> 37:26.542
as if cigarettes
didn't kill you fast enough.

37:26.576 --> 37:29.244
So the weapon came
from an old tobacco factory?

37:29.279 --> 37:30.913
It makes sense.
Look at this.

37:30.947 --> 37:34.883
The weapon was
a tobacco scythe.

37:38.888 --> 37:39.988
Old Dominion Cigarettes.

37:40.023 --> 37:41.323
They went out of
business in '68.

37:41.357 --> 37:43.392
The factory is abandoned.

37:43.426 --> 37:46.161
And it is eight miles
from the McNamaras' estate

37:46.196 --> 37:48.597
and 15 miles
from Palter's house.

37:48.631 --> 37:50.192
You know what?
That's a perfect location

37:50.200 --> 37:52.167
for Kessler to retreat to
after an attack.

37:52.202 --> 37:53.869
You guys did
a great job, Bones.

37:53.903 --> 37:56.071
I'll only accept that compliment
if no one else dies.

37:56.106 --> 37:57.506
Have you called
for additional support?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.675
No, no, no.
Look, I know guys

37:59.709 --> 38:01.443
like Kessler, all right?
The quieter we are,

38:01.478 --> 38:04.346
the better chance
we have in getting him.

38:13.857 --> 38:14.957
His light is on.

38:48.691 --> 38:50.659
Don't do it, Kessler.

38:50.693 --> 38:53.428
I did what I needed to do.

38:53.463 --> 38:57.099
I set the record straight.
That's what I wanted.

38:57.133 --> 38:59.201
If he jumps from that height,
his neck will snap.

38:59.235 --> 39:01.203
We wouldn't have
time to cut him down.

39:01.237 --> 39:04.806
You have information
that we need-- you can help.

39:04.841 --> 39:06.175
I have nothing.

39:06.209 --> 39:07.976
I've had nothing
since they put me away.

39:08.011 --> 39:10.812
You had missing
files on McNamara.

39:10.847 --> 39:12.481
On the cover-up.
And you think

39:12.515 --> 39:13.749
you can get justice?

39:13.783 --> 39:16.018
The law isn't for people
like them.

39:16.052 --> 39:17.352
You've got to try.

39:17.387 --> 39:19.254
We can help.

39:22.225 --> 39:23.458
I'm sorry.

39:23.493 --> 39:25.327
I'm tired.

39:30.133 --> 39:31.633
Why did you do that?

39:31.668 --> 39:33.936
They'll never let me live,
anyway.

39:33.970 --> 39:35.170
You'll live.

39:35.205 --> 39:37.172
I promise that.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.743
Hey.

40:14.777 --> 40:16.511
Booth.

40:16.546 --> 40:18.380
Look at that.

40:18.414 --> 40:19.723
Oh, beer?

40:19.748 --> 40:21.383
Well, it's all they had
at the convenience store.

40:21.384 --> 40:24.987
And we have to celebrate 'cause
we caught the Ghost Killer.

40:25.021 --> 40:28.824
Are you hungry? Because
I am pretty sure that...

40:28.858 --> 40:31.059
beer from Missouri
goes very well

40:31.094 --> 40:34.029
with leftovers.
Eh, just drink the beer

40:34.063 --> 40:36.431
from... Missouri, huh?

40:36.466 --> 40:38.166
Alexander's Famous.

40:38.201 --> 40:42.004
So, um, Stark
and Caroline,

40:42.038 --> 40:43.839
they're trying
to figure out a deal

40:43.873 --> 40:45.741
so Kessler
will cooperate.

40:45.775 --> 40:48.910
He's a killer.
Yeah, but who he killed.

40:48.945 --> 40:51.413
In the Old West, they would've
made him a sheriff.

40:51.447 --> 40:53.415
So, um, Stark

40:53.449 --> 40:55.417
has finally recommended me
for that promotion.

40:55.451 --> 40:58.220
Course, I have to be confirmed
by the House subcommittee.

40:58.254 --> 41:00.355
Congratulations, Booth.

41:00.390 --> 41:02.391
This calls for a toast.
Mmm.

41:02.425 --> 41:03.959
To you.
No, no, wait.

41:03.993 --> 41:05.394
To us, okay? 'Cause I told him

41:05.428 --> 41:06.595
no matter what happens to us,

41:06.629 --> 41:08.163
we're still a team.

41:08.197 --> 41:10.866
Well, that's
basically the definition

41:10.900 --> 41:12.534
of marriage, isn't it?

41:12.568 --> 41:14.569
Does that mean I...
don't have to finish

41:14.604 --> 41:16.271
filling out this
questionnaire?

41:16.306 --> 41:18.240
No, you know what, uh,
you should still do it.

41:18.274 --> 41:19.975
The government,
they love their paperwork.

41:20.009 --> 41:24.012
Okay. There was one question
asking if we had a relationship

41:24.047 --> 41:25.084
outside of work, so...

41:25.109 --> 41:27.231
You should probably
just skip that one.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.686
Oh. Um, I wrote all this.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.254
You wrote all this.

41:32.288 --> 41:34.556
Whoa! About our sex life?

41:34.590 --> 41:37.492
Well, are you suggesting
that it isn't interesting?

41:37.527 --> 41:40.128
No, no, but...
They told me to be thorough.

41:40.163 --> 41:44.266
I also put that you never throw
your socks into the hamper.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.601
In case the floor is cold,
I put the socks on

41:46.636 --> 41:49.237
so my feet stay warm-- but they
don't really care about that.

41:49.272 --> 41:51.206
What if I'm called before
Congress to testify,

41:51.240 --> 41:52.774
and they ask
why I ignored

41:52.809 --> 41:55.177
the question?
Just ignore it for now, okay?

41:55.211 --> 41:57.212
Here's to catching
the Ghost Killer.

41:58.648 --> 42:00.684
To Missouri.
Beer from Missouri.
