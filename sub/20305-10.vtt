WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.877
Put the stool down right now!

00:02.961 --> 00:04.129
I'll put you down!

00:04.337 --> 00:06.673
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:06.756 --> 00:09.050
You totally believe
in the free enterprise system,

00:09.134 --> 00:11.845
-anyone can become a success?
-Oh, without question.

00:11.928 --> 00:15.765
The guy asked me to give him whipped cream
and hot fudge for 35 bucks.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.475
I don't think I misunderstood.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.352
Whipped cream and hot fudge?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.604
Let's keep those other two Russians
comfortable and isolated.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.690
Low profile, everybody. Nothing happened.

00:23.773 --> 00:27.777
I understand there's a hostage situation
developing at Hill Street.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.946
-A Russian.
-Actually, it's nothing.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.323
They're breaking in down there.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.786
(tires squeal)

00:42.292 --> 00:46.588
Item seven. The yule approaches.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.258
Uh, additional holiday assignments.

00:50.341 --> 00:54.054
Foot patrol accompanying
the Salvation Army band

00:54.137 --> 00:56.723
and Mt. Herman Baptist Gospel Choir
on their combined,

00:56.806 --> 01:01.936
and I might add courageous annual serenade
of the Center Street Projects.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.814
Officers Meyer, Granly and Schwartz.

01:05.148 --> 01:08.943
Overseeing this afternoon's gift giveaway
at the Hurdle Youth Facility,

01:09.235 --> 01:10.612
Margolis and Richmond.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.282
Item eight concerns the visit of, uh...

01:15.116 --> 01:20.371
Hmm, now these are representatives
of the Journalist Union for Publications

01:20.455 --> 01:23.291
of Manufacturing and Farm Collectives

01:23.666 --> 01:26.169
of the Soviet Republic of Georgia.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.964
Now these scribes have asked
during their stay in our fair city

01:30.215 --> 01:33.802
to see the situation
of the proletariat class

01:34.010 --> 01:36.513
in a true American ghetto.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.681
-(laughter)
-We qualify.

01:39.224 --> 01:43.436
Lt. Hunter will supervise their tour
commencing at 800 hours.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.939
Officers Hill and Renko
to serve as escorts.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.024
Questions I'd like to ask them creeps.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.360
There'll be no editorializing, Andy.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.570
The podium notes with envy

01:52.654 --> 01:56.241
your itinerary stop
at Maynard's Country Kitchen.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.034
-Oh!
-ESTERHAUS: Item nine.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.205
A particular rise in robberies
of pharmacies, ambulances,

02:02.288 --> 02:04.207
medical and veterinary offices

02:04.290 --> 02:09.212
has ensued following our recent
narcotics operation in Little Ecuador

02:09.295 --> 02:10.547
and the panic is on, people.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.800
Now Detective Belker
begins an undercover today

02:13.883 --> 02:16.761
with the Fairview Ambulance Service.
Be alert for backup.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.681
Tough choice.
Mouth to mouth from Belker or death.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.268
-(laughter)
-ESTERHAUS: Item ten is a welcome return

02:23.643 --> 02:27.522
to alumni Marty Nichols and Al Bolino...

02:27.605 --> 02:29.649
(cheering)

02:30.733 --> 02:35.989
...who along with six
of their fellow officers from South Ferry

02:36.197 --> 02:37.740
will be fleshing out, as it were,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.578
our ongoing prostitution undercover
on East Utica.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.956
I'm afraid to ask Al
what he's gonna be doing.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.541
(cheering)

02:46.624 --> 02:49.961
Item 11,
what I hope is a very temporary situation.

02:50.044 --> 02:52.755
You're advised of a temporary freeze

02:52.839 --> 02:56.092
on all promotions as regards to the force.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.719
(groaning)

02:58.428 --> 02:59.512
Courage, Lucy.

03:02.223 --> 03:07.770
Item last. A Christmas reminder
from our confreres in the judicial arm

03:07.854 --> 03:12.609
share our own deep desire to honor
holiday shopping and party commitments.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.652
Our adversaries in the streets,

03:14.736 --> 03:17.614
sometimes their families
and loved ones as well.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.033
In the seven days left until Christmas,

03:20.116 --> 03:21.951
let us not therefore be adverse

03:22.035 --> 03:25.455
to tipping the scales
on the close ones, huh?

03:26.122 --> 03:28.875
Away from the bust.
Away from the paperwork.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.085
Away from the testimony.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.047
Away from the lonely
Christmas incarceration.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.717
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.054
And, hey, hey.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.264
Let's be careful out there.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.766
MAN: You got it, Sarge.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.645
Can't even speak my own language

03:48.728 --> 03:52.523
when I have to go out to a place
to eat soul food with a bunch of Russkies.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.444
Can you believe those jerks?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.781
-Hey, that's rotten luck.
-It's not luck. It's politics.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.241
Ozzie Cleveland just
wants everybody to know

04:01.324 --> 04:03.701
just because he's a cop
he's not gonna be playing favorites.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.162
Yeah, because of the budget problems.
That makes sense.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.413
So you agree with him?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.791
No, I agree what he said.
That makes sense.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.417
That's probably why he's doing it.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.212
You know, you don't seem
too broken up about this, Joe.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.966
Hey, I feel bad, okay, Luce?

04:18.424 --> 04:20.343
But if you ask me if I'm sorry
that it's gonna be you

04:20.426 --> 04:22.220
rather than some beer-bellied grunt

04:22.303 --> 04:24.514
sitting next to me in the unit,
the answer's no.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.308
At least you're honest.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.978
You'll be wearing stripes within a year.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.939
-A year?
-Eighteen months max.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.608
-Hey, hey.
-Hey, Joe. How you doing?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.068
-Great. Whoa.
-Hi, Marty.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.780
Bobby, hi.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.365
Hi, Marty.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.701
You look great.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.494
(chuckles) Thanks.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.871
You do, too. A lot better than the rumors.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.375
Winning that lottery
put me through a lot of changes.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.877
-That's behind me now.
-Oh, along with the money?

04:55.128 --> 04:58.214
(chuckles) No, I have a--
I still have a few crumbs left.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.968
How about I scrape together a few
to take you out to dinner tonight?

05:02.927 --> 05:04.971
Yeah, I'd like that.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.973
You give me some illegal thoughts.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.600
Ain't for sale to you anyway, sugar.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.942
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

05:18.401 --> 05:20.111
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:20.194 --> 05:23.990
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:24.073 --> 05:25.658
(sirens wailing)

05:31.080 --> 05:35.001
(theme music playing)

07:00.336 --> 07:01.421
(music playing on radio)

07:01.504 --> 07:03.047
If we get hit by robbers,
you let them take

07:03.131 --> 07:05.258
whatever it is they take
and let them get out of here.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.593
Once they're out on the street,
I'll nail 'em.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.346
Last time I chased them
with a two-by-four.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.973
Curtis had a lead pipe.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.142
Kids. It's always kids.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.436
CURTIS: That's because junkies
don't get to be too old.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.439
Hey, brilliant philosophical
observation, Curtis.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.316
I got to warn you, Sarge,
even if we don't get robbed

07:22.400 --> 07:24.527
you may be in
for some pretty funky stuff today.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.946
It's all right.
I got a note from my mother.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.115
You guys see a lot of bullet holes,

07:29.198 --> 07:31.451
but we get action on this gig
worse then I saw in 'Nam.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.246
MAN (on radio):
<i>Unit four, unit four, please respond.</i>

07:35.329 --> 07:37.373
Curtis, cool the tape.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.917
(music stops)

07:40.877 --> 07:41.961
Unit four, go ahead.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.006
MAN (on radio): <i>We have a 63-year-old</i>
<i>female with chest pain</i>

07:45.089 --> 07:47.091
<i>at 133rd and Dekker.</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:49.177
Unit four responding.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.805
(tires squeal)

07:53.097 --> 07:54.974
-Hundredth and Dekker.
-CURTIS: Hundredth and Dekker.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.478
Hey, hair bag, they said 133rd and Dekker.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.022
-What's doing?
-I'm doing.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.065
(siren blaring)

08:06.444 --> 08:09.322
Last week we got a junkie
who sat on a seltzer bottle.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.992
It was like delivering a baby
except you could return it for deposit.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.163
Coming up on 130th.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.834
(tires squeal)

08:23.753 --> 08:24.587
(siren stops)

08:26.130 --> 08:28.925
Five seconds off median,
14 off the record.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.094
Well, first one's always the slowest.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.981
How long did your heart stop
for this time, Mrs. Randolph?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.358
-How long?
-Yeah.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.068
Let's see.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.445
Maybe about 30 minutes.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.363
Uh-huh.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.158
Well, it's beating nice and strong now.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.452
But I think we better take you in anyway.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.871
Besides, I think it's time
for your clinic appointment.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.208
(laughs) Louis, I was just
thinking about that last night.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.502
I noticed my pills
were getting kind of low.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.089
So if you could kindly help me up,
I'll go get my medicine.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.423
Nice and easy, sweetheart.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.925
-(groans)
-Nice and easy.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.344
-Oh, goodness. Thank you.
-Okay.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.971
-Thank you, Louis.
-You're welcome.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.058
She don't look too sick.

09:20.059 --> 09:20.893
Not too bad.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.895
She's hypertensive.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
Sure she's not using you for a taxi?

09:27.149 --> 09:28.693
Ever try to get a taxi up here?

09:30.027 --> 09:31.696
Got a little something for you boys.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.197
-Curtis.
-Thank you.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.865
-Louis.
-Thank you.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.453
Here.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.497
Thank you.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.625
Okay, nice and easy now.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.002
-Alrighty.
-That's it.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.713
Oh, boy. Am I all right now?

09:48.796 --> 09:50.923
You're fine now. Just lie back.
There we go.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.508
Okay, I'm ready.

09:53.509 --> 09:55.595
-What's your name?
-Michael.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.515
Michael? Wait a minute.
You... you from the welfare?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.017
No.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.768
Keep it.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.188
Okay. Watch your elbows now.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.608
Nice and easy. Coming through.
That's it, darling.

10:09.066 --> 10:09.984
Nice and easy.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.198
It's good, huh?

10:16.741 --> 10:17.658
Great, Maynard.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.663
This gentlemen
is a pillar of his community.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.877
He provides meals for the needy
each Thanksgiving and Christmas.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.880
And every year,
he hosts a party as Santa Claus

10:30.963 --> 10:32.340
for the neighborhood children.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.552
-Problems of pigmentation notwithstanding.
-(radio playing music)

10:39.847 --> 10:43.059
Excuse me, please. What is this appliance?

10:43.601 --> 10:47.521
Oh, that, Mr. Tcherchenko,
is your basic ghetto blaster.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.815
You see, you put a little tape cassette
in here like this

10:49.899 --> 10:52.610
and you prop the box up on your shoulders,
sort of walk down the street

10:52.693 --> 10:55.196
until the volume
sort of makes your nose bleed.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.201
Tape cassette?

11:01.410 --> 11:03.204
Impressions, Mr. Manaspili?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.915
Oh, I am still gathering leads.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.335
Yes, Konstantin observes everything,
Lieutenant. He misses nothing.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.836
Hey, Bobby.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.297
You said these folks
are from Russian Georgia?

11:13.714 --> 11:16.008
They eat like they're from Macon, Georgia.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.177
(chuckles) Righteous meal there, Maynard.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.848
-MAYNARD: How do you like it?
-WOMAN: Oh, it is completely delicious.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.433
I hope you will tell me the ingredients.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.436
Uh-oh, that may be a state secret.
(chuckles)

11:28.020 --> 11:29.647
No, we got it for you.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.981
Lots of folks ask.

11:31.482 --> 11:35.069
Excuse me, is it so easy
for a person in America

11:35.152 --> 11:37.321
to become successful and give away food?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.491
Well, I wouldn't say it's easy, mister.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.785
Can I have some bones?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.663
Honey, we're still using it
to make the soup.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.582
Thought-thought you
were giving bones away.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.751
You're supposed to be giving bones away.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.003
But we're still using it for the soup.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.047
I see your bones. Now give me them!

11:55.131 --> 11:56.549
Maynard, the man's giving me a hard time.

11:56.632 --> 12:01.053
-I can't keep my dog tied outside all day.
-MAYNARD: As soon as we can--

12:01.137 --> 12:03.514
-I need the bones!
-Take it easy now.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.559
The woman's lying to me.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.019
Man, get that stool down right now.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.021
Put the stool down right now!

12:11.105 --> 12:12.356
I'll put you down!

12:13.566 --> 12:14.942
-Get off!
-Get back!

12:15.484 --> 12:17.278
-You all right, sugar?
-I think so.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.113
-Am I cut?
-No, uh-uh.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.073
(indistinct arguing)

12:21.157 --> 12:22.616
-Okay, what's your name?
-Tyrone.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.368
Who's gonna take care of my dog?

12:24.452 --> 12:26.579
-We'll keep the dog here.
-All right, Tyrone.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.080
This is regrettable. We'll go--

12:28.164 --> 12:30.583
We'd like very much to see
your procedures of arrest.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.627
We would wish to follow
the entire arrest procedure.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.754
Would this be possible?

12:35.963 --> 12:37.548
We have no gulags here.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.843
We do our penal linen
in fresh air and sunlight.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.762
-Come along if you like.
-BOBBY: Let's go.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.015
If you so desire,
you have the right to remain silent.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.226
-Now that's my recipes.
-Oh.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.061
-And please come back.
-Thank you.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.897
<i>Spasibo,</i> Maynard.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.276
-Yeah.
-Maynard, did the city's visitor bureau

12:57.359 --> 12:58.652
make arrangement for payment?

12:59.445 --> 13:00.279
Uh-uh.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.037
Book this creep.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.081
-LEO: Charge?
-Soliciting.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.958
And just being a degenerate.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.336
-Rob, how you doing?
-J.D.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.087
Yeah, I'm great, man. How about...

13:21.091 --> 13:22.885
Rob, what's going on here?

13:22.968 --> 13:25.221
-You got to help me out, J.D.
-Officer Nichols?

13:25.596 --> 13:26.889
-You know this guy?
-Yeah, I do.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.724
He's a family member.
He's my sister's husband.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.268
Well, he's sick. He needs a lot of help.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.770
Rob, what have you done?

13:34.605 --> 13:35.731
Okay, uh, what's the charge?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.816
Soliciting.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.196
-Come on, J.D.
-Come on, J.D., what?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.615
-He approach you?
-He sure did.

13:45.074 --> 13:45.991
Officer Nichols...

13:47.993 --> 13:50.412
is there any chance
you might have been mistaken?

13:50.496 --> 13:53.332
I mean, this guy is married to my sister.
I can't believe he'd--

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
Okay, maybe you misunderstood.

13:56.001 --> 14:01.090
J.D., the guy asked me to give him
whipped cream and hot fudge for 35 bucks.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.800
I don't think I misunderstood.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.844
Whipped cream and hot fudge?

14:05.386 --> 14:07.304
What's whipped cream and hot fudge?

14:07.513 --> 14:11.767
-J.D., you think you can--
-Whipped cream and hot fudge?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.186
Book him.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.861
-Bad news, Frank.
-What?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.280
Mother's coming in on an earlier flight.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.824
How much earlier? She still coming in
on Tuesday, isn't she?

14:26.907 --> 14:29.785
-Tomorrow, 1:30.
-Wonderful.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.249
Needless to say,
I'm more than a little irritated with Fay.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.543
I asked her to keep Frank Jr.
this weekend.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.880
-She said no?
-She said she needed the space.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.797
I'll call her.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.010
I'm going to send a cab
to the airport for Mother, Frank.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.512
-She's going to stay with us.
-What about her hotel?

14:48.596 --> 14:50.055
It'll only be a few nights.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.807
She couldn't get a reservation, okay?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.434
Okay.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.229
-Tyrone Crane?
-Vandalism.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.689
Hmm.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.609
You've got a spot.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.153
I'm not going to do this. See you.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.237
See you.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.495
You sure you're all right with Mother
staying with us for a few nights?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.372
Oh, no problem.
There's gonna be plenty of room

15:15.456 --> 15:17.416
because as soon as you leave here
I'm gonna kill myself.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.918
(laughs)

15:21.754 --> 15:22.671
(door closes)

15:22.755 --> 15:27.760
All alleged perpetrators must undergo
this fingerprinting process.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.678
Where's my dog? Where is he?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.889
He's in the restaurant, Tyrone. He's fine.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.516
-I got to see him.
-Hey, now, Tyrone.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.644
You take it easy.
Your pooch is going to be all right.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.355
But you're gonna end up spending
the Christmas season in the kennel

15:39.438 --> 15:41.065
if you don't straighten up. You hear me?

15:41.148 --> 15:43.317
Come on, give me that.
Take a walk over here now.

15:44.026 --> 15:44.860
Leo?

15:45.319 --> 15:48.113
Just photographs, Ms. Davenport.
Then he's all yours.

15:48.197 --> 15:52.117
Mr. Crane and his attorney
will counsel us to his situation

15:52.910 --> 15:55.955
which is a portion of the process
that our constitution says

15:56.038 --> 15:57.581
that we cannot attend.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.834
And I thought that we
would use the interval

16:01.752 --> 16:03.879
to tour the rest of the facility

16:04.171 --> 16:05.255
if that pleases you.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.132
-Sure.
-Oh, good.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.342
Follow me.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.138
Do you have family, Tyrone?

16:13.764 --> 16:16.684
I left when my ma died.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.144
What about brothers and sisters?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.063
I don't know where they is.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.734
I didn't mean to hurt nobody.
I just wanted to get him his bones.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.487
I understand you
care for your dog, Tyrone,

16:28.570 --> 16:31.407
but it's against the law
to destroy another person's property.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.741
Do you understand that?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.410
Yes.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.330
You see a doctor?

16:38.956 --> 16:40.165
At the clinic.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.751
-I got medication.
-What kind?

16:43.544 --> 16:44.378
To calm down.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.921
The Hurdle Clinic?

16:47.464 --> 16:48.632
What's your doctor's name?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.884
Dr. Ramish.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.221
How often are you supposed to see him?

16:55.139 --> 16:56.056
Tuesdays.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.645
Your record's pretty clean.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.442
And the judge doesn't want to have people
spend Christmas in jail.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.403
It's my guess...

17:10.404 --> 17:12.865
he might put you on probation
if you make restitution

17:12.948 --> 17:14.241
to the man in the restaurant.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.286
Yes, ma'am.
I would if I could keep my dog.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.413
No one else wants your dog, Tyrone.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.459
Would you promise not to cause
any more trouble over there?

17:24.126 --> 17:24.960
Yes, ma'am.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.051
There'll be an arraignment
in a little while in court.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.219
I'll see you there.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.181
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.266
Merry Christmas.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.646
Merry Christmas, Tyrone.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.406
Now this officer is in charge
of our supplementary holding facility

17:54.490 --> 17:56.950
which we refer to as the garden level.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.368
(chuckles)

17:58.452 --> 18:00.788
You truly believe
in the free enterprise system,

18:00.871 --> 18:02.414
anyone can become a success?

18:02.498 --> 18:05.417
Oh, without question.
Why, look at Maynard.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.419
Our host at that restaurant.

18:07.961 --> 18:12.716
Here is a man with the educational
and economic cards stacked against him,

18:12.800 --> 18:15.177
and yet he's kind, honorable, hardworking.

18:15.469 --> 18:19.014
You see, in America,
a man who makes a better mousetrap

18:19.098 --> 18:21.266
-will ultimately succeed.
-(laughing)

18:21.809 --> 18:23.352
Do you hear this, Ludmilla?

18:23.852 --> 18:26.438
It is like my brother in Phoenix
has spoke to you of.

18:26.897 --> 18:30.275
I do not ask of Konstantin here
since Konstantin has everything.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.821
Lieutenant, what will finally happen
to the criminal?

18:34.279 --> 18:37.157
Oh, well, Mr. Crane has a right to a trial

18:37.241 --> 18:40.536
by 12 of his peers
all of whom must vote to convict.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.872
Yes, but we have read
of your plea bargaining system.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.500
HOWARD: Well, it's true,
he may be given inducements

18:46.583 --> 18:48.460
to plead guilty to a lesser charge.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.295
Believe me, this is a flaw.

18:50.379 --> 18:54.091
And will he not be convicted
solely because he is a Black?

18:54.842 --> 18:57.970
HOWARD: No, not for this minor offense.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.930
He probably
won't even be convicted at all.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.725
As instinctive believers in the individual
as against the collective,

19:03.809 --> 19:06.645
we surround our defendants
with protections.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.649
I demand asylum.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.409
-What's going on?
-Something with those Russians.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.244
Later for the Russians, Neal.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.163
This little scenario
is shaping up to satisfy

19:24.246 --> 19:26.415
my transportation needs
for the next decade.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.670
Give me a couple seconds, Marty, okay?

19:34.381 --> 19:37.968
So, uh, they're taking you
for arraignment, huh, Rob?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.469
My lawyer's meeting me there.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.263
Thinks maybe we can beat it on entrapment.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.973
Yeah, did he think
he could get to the newspapers

19:43.056 --> 19:45.100
-and the radio stations?
-What do you mean?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.894
They're publishing the johns list now.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.605
Reading the names on the air, you know,
the guys arrested for soliciting.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.023
-No.
-Every day.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.150
Look, J.D., we had
our differences in the past.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.402
Hey, any close family,
that's gonna happen.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.654
I'm telling you, J.D.,
I'm on thin ice with Peggy now.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.364
This'll do it. The marriage will drown.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.951
All right, look. Maybe I overreacted.
I mean, it was such a shock.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.037
-You want me to see what I can do?
-Would you?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.080
-I can try.
-I'd be grateful, man.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.876
The only thing is
I've been getting these visions.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.503
-Yeah.
-At night, I keep seeing automobiles,

20:13.587 --> 20:15.505
presidents, I can't figure it out.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.423
Try.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.886
Well, maybe I'm seeing automobiles
that are named for presidents.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.804
Yeah, like the one that freed the slaves.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.390
Okay, a year's lease on me.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.060
Now, I keep seeing an owner's slip
in the glove compartment

20:28.143 --> 20:29.811
that says J.D. LaRue.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.188
You swine.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.483
Okay, line up for transport
for arraignment.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.361
Hey, come on.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.573
Okay, J.D. You got it.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.159
Attaboy. But jeez, Rob.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.911
I don't know. Whipped cream and hot fudge?

20:45.994 --> 20:48.288
Whatever happened to
the old fashioned banana split?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.001
Follow along here, buddy.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.379
He won't come out
until he talks to his brother.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.590
I don't know if he's a spy.
Doesn't look like a spy.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.593
-FBI is on the way, Frank.
-What in the hell happened, Howard?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.053
Tcherchenko must have been
planning it, Frank.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.596
He's the one that asked to come back here.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.265
-We gonna let him make his call?
-What call?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.934
His brother owns a liquor store
in Phoenix. He wants to call him.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.686
All right, just keep the garden level
sealed off.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.188
No decision on any of it
till the FBI guys get here.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.856
Prudent, Frank, if not bold.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.400
Division wants an open line.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.652
Set it up, Ray. Henry.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.321
Let's keep those other two Russians
comfortable and isolated.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.408
Low profile, everybody. Nothing to press.
Nothing. Nothing happened.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.243
At least till the FBI gets here.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.831
JUDGE: Counsel approach.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.749
You two officers, please.

21:41.550 --> 21:45.512
I understand there's a hostage situation
developing at Hill Street.

21:46.054 --> 21:46.930
A Russian?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.849
Well, yes, sir, Your Honor, Judge.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.393
(stammers) But actually it's nothing.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.978
Uh-huh. Well...

21:54.730 --> 21:57.316
what do we have over there, officers?

21:57.399 --> 21:59.484
BOBBY: He got into a beef
at a restaurant, Your Honor.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.069
He smashed a display case.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.572
One prior disorderly.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.783
JOYCE: He's receiving lithium treatment
at the Hurdle Clinic.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.036
I called his doctor about an hour ago.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.789
He described Tyrone as fairly flakey.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.167
Wouldn't classify a major risk.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.502
Where's our complainant?

22:18.962 --> 22:20.922
Um, I guess he's busy, Your Honor.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.217
Officers, on a scale of one to ten

22:24.301 --> 22:27.471
if I told you that I'm inclined
towards charity of the season,

22:28.221 --> 22:29.598
how crazy is this guy?

22:30.891 --> 22:31.933
Ooh, maybe a six.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.852
-Five and a half.
-Five and a half to six.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.688
Objections to adjournment
in contemplation?

22:36.772 --> 22:39.149
-None, Your Honor.
-Well, let's proceed.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.699
What made you so upset
in the restaurant, Mr. Crane?

22:50.410 --> 22:51.620
Worry for my dog.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.038
Mm-hmm.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.833
Case is adjourned
in contemplation of dismissal.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.211
Do you understand that, young man?

22:59.294 --> 23:03.757
If you misbehave, you won't get another
Christmas present from me.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.926
I'll have you right back in here.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.971
As it is, I'll want you to pay
the restaurant for damages.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.224
Yes, sir.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.434
All right.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.189
You're free to go, Tyrone.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.235
-Can I get my dog now?
-BAILIFF: Docket number J3095.

23:23.318 --> 23:26.238
Robert Nelson, 707 of the penal code.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.823
Unlawful solicitation.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.701
Complainants officer, Martha Nichols.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.621
Hey, you tell me.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.373
Whipped cream and hot fudge.

23:36.456 --> 23:40.085
It's possible to construe
defendant's request as innocuous.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.214
-No money changed hands?
-None did, Your Honor.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.300
And I admit, I've been on this job
for four years,

23:47.384 --> 23:50.178
but whipped cream and hot fudge,
that's a new one on me.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.514
Judge, I know when I've been solicited.

23:52.597 --> 23:56.768
That knowledge notwithstanding, officer,
with language as ambiguous as this,

23:56.852 --> 23:58.562
you should have waited for the cash.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.105
Dismissed.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.945
-Big shot.
-Hey, what time this afternoon

24:07.028 --> 24:08.196
should I come down to the lot?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.531
What for? What'd you do for me?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.199
I told the DA it was nothing.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.909
Even the judge knew it was nothing.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.661
They don't publish the names
of those arrested.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.872
-Just convicted, right?
-Rob--

24:17.122 --> 24:19.291
-I turned this one for you.
-Get lost.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.593
(music playing)

24:30.469 --> 24:32.304
(whistles) Lunchtime.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.850
Curtis, chips.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.562
Coming out.

24:42.689 --> 24:45.025
Go ahead, close the curtains.
See if I care.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.485
That's sardines.

24:47.152 --> 24:47.986
And onions.

24:52.032 --> 24:52.866
What?

24:53.909 --> 24:54.743
Nothing.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.245
You want half?

24:58.538 --> 24:59.372
Yeah.

24:59.789 --> 25:00.624
Go ahead.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.667
Thank you.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.507
MAN (on radio): <i>Unit four, unit four,</i>
<i>please respond.</i>

25:08.590 --> 25:09.424
Never fails.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.427
This is unit four. Go ahead.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.222
<i>Twenty-four-year-old black male</i>
<i>with acute abdominal pain</i>

25:15.305 --> 25:18.016
<i>at 141 Liberty, apartment six.</i>

25:18.600 --> 25:20.268
Got it. Let's go.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.812
(siren wailing)

25:25.565 --> 25:26.900
(tires squeal)

25:45.877 --> 25:48.421
Hey, I know this building.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.006
It's a shooting gallery.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.300
We get ten calls a day
to shooting galleries.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.149
They hit me with a pipe.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.652
Okay, try not to move or talk,
all right, pal?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.404
Everything's gonna be all right.

26:13.613 --> 26:14.531
Look straight ahead.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.123
Jeez, they're breaking in down there.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.041
Curtis, get me an air pipe.

26:31.631 --> 26:32.882
(tires squealing)

26:43.518 --> 26:45.395
(shouting)

26:51.610 --> 26:54.446
Frank, this is Agent Ramsey,
Federal Bureau.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.740
Yes, I remember.
How are you? Henry Goldblume.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.700
How do you do? Now, here's the agenda.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.077
I'll interview the defector,
make a preliminary call

27:01.161 --> 27:02.621
whether he's got intelligence value,

27:02.704 --> 27:05.165
whether he's political,
whether the state steps in or what.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.125
Now, which of the other individuals

27:07.208 --> 27:09.336
-has tried to call his embassy?
-Neither one.

27:10.003 --> 27:13.089
That's weird.
In a delegation, you always have one KGB.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.883
-He always tries to call his embassy.
-Tcherchenko.

27:14.966 --> 27:17.093
The guy who defected
wants to call a brother in Phoenix.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.638
That's fine as long as I can listen
and record. You got a setup?

27:19.721 --> 27:21.556
Yeah, we should have a phone hookup
in five minutes.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.100
-Okay, good. Can we listen?
-Yeah. Go ahead.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.895
-The brother in Phoenix, he naturalized?
-I don't know.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.731
BOBBY: Yeah, extension 4366.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.524
-Great, thank you. Maynard.
-Hey.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.902
Sorry. I was so busy
I wasn't able to make it downtown.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.488
-Hey, that's all right.
-I hate not to do my duty.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.990
But, I mean, my duties
are in the restaurant this week.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.034
Maynard, I expect you
don't want to see that boy

27:41.117 --> 27:43.453
cooling his heels in the stir
during Christmas time.

27:43.536 --> 27:47.248
Well, that, too, but he
didn't really do that much damage.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.625
He's supposed to make restitution.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.418
If he doesn't or causes you
any more trouble--

27:50.502 --> 27:52.837
I know just who to call. Thank you.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.174
Now, I brought a few items.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.846
-And Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Maynard.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.476
Ooh, Bobby Hill, I just died
and passed on through the pearly gates.

28:07.310 --> 28:08.812
(speaking Russian)

28:25.954 --> 28:27.831
His brother owns a liquor store.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.084
Tcherchenko figures it's Macy's.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.629
Uh, the brother tries to explain

28:34.713 --> 28:37.757
it's more of a mom and pop setup.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.760
-(Mischa continues speaking Russian)
-Tcherchenko can't believe it.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.680
Says, "Anton, your letters

28:43.763 --> 28:46.224
spoke of so much business."

28:46.641 --> 28:49.853
(speaking Russian)

28:54.899 --> 28:57.193
(in English)
Yes, I say it in your English.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.821
You are no blood of mine.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.658
Can you believe my own brother?

29:03.742 --> 29:06.411
A rich lucky fella,
and delivery boy I must be.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.624
This is Agent Ramsey
from our Federal Bureau of Investigation.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.585
Yes, of course. FBI.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.587
He has some questions.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.756
Yes, of course.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.133
I'll take care of this. Excuse me.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.305
Frank, I'm sorry
I didn't get back to you sooner.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.223
I've been running around
like crazy all day.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.725
Fay, listen, we have a real problem.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.227
-Joyce's mother is arriving tomorrow.
-I can't, Frank.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.979
I'm sorry. I already told Joyce.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.773
I got plans of my own for the weekend.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.483
-The whole weekend?
-Yeah.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.902
I'm going out of town.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.284
-Alone?
-No.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.536
Somebody new in your life?

29:49.746 --> 29:50.580
Yeah.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.959
Look, um, all right. I'll-I'll take him.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.921
No. No, I didn't know. I, um...

29:58.004 --> 29:59.964
I'm taking the baby anyway. You know, so--

30:00.048 --> 30:01.883
Let me try to work something out here.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.052
The last thing in the world you need
is a couple of kids along

30:04.135 --> 30:05.637
messing up a romantic weekend.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.514
No, no, no.
Really, Frank. It'll be all right.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.808
I mean, thank God this man's an adult.

30:09.891 --> 30:10.892
Meaning I'm not?

30:12.519 --> 30:15.104
Don't be so sensitive.
I was thinking of Paul Grogan.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.068
Anyhow, listen, it's gonna be all okay.
I'll work it out.

30:21.402 --> 30:22.529
-You sure?
-Sure.

30:28.827 --> 30:29.994
Really appreciate it, Fay.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.746
This guy sounds special.

30:32.163 --> 30:32.997
He is.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.041
Bye, Frank.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.922
HENRY:
That's the information I have. It's over.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.465
Yeah, bye-bye.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.133
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.343
Got a minute?

30:46.427 --> 30:47.262
Yeah.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.358
Problem?

31:00.775 --> 31:02.652
Frank's mother-in-law
is coming in town tomorrow

31:02.735 --> 31:04.904
and apparently
there's some sort of hotel screw up.

31:04.988 --> 31:07.782
Anyhow, she's got to stay with them so
they can't keep Frank Jr. for the weekend.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.702
No problem.
Taking the baby, we'll take him, too.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.455
Yeah, and the next time he sees his father
he'll tell him all about us.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.374
Ah.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.045
So, uh, I guess we should cancel?

31:21.129 --> 31:22.463
Absolutely not.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.800
Now listen to me, Fay.
We want to be together.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.635
I wouldn't do anything
behind a closed door

31:27.719 --> 31:29.387
I wouldn't acknowledge outside of it.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.556
If you want, I'll go tell him right now.

31:31.848 --> 31:32.682
No.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.560
Listen, he's gonna know
soon enough anyhow.

31:35.643 --> 31:39.981
It's just that, you know,
for right now, it's our secret.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.608
I want to keep it a little longer.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.325
See you.

31:54.662 --> 31:56.873
JOE: Come on, Luce.
The promotion freeze is only temporary.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.374
LUCY: It better be only temporary.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.377
472 East Utica.
Backups will meet you there.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.303
You may call your embassy now if you wish.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.055
Thank you.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.807
We have a telephone that you can use.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.645
Thank you, but I desire
to talk to Tcherchenko.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.480
-That is all.
-(chuckles)

32:20.563 --> 32:21.439
Well, <i>nyet,</i> my friend.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.608
Just now,
he's completing preliminary interviews

32:23.691 --> 32:25.401
on his lonely pathway to freedom.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.282
Can't figure this one out.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.952
Did he say what he wants?

32:34.035 --> 32:36.579
There's always about five percent of them,
they don't know what they want.

32:36.663 --> 32:40.500
They apply for asylum, six months later
they reapply, they want to go back again.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.794
I've done 12 of these previous.
Never had one like this.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.713
No political motive. Throws his
one economic motive out the window.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.174
Got nothing to offer of value.
Guy's so off the wall.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.468
If he's a KGB seed,
it'd be the trick of the year.

32:50.885 --> 32:52.804
If I had a guess,
I'd say he's in that five percent.

32:52.887 --> 32:56.182
-Can we get rid of him?
-I'll have my supervisor evaluate first.

32:56.265 --> 32:58.393
Tell you, guy like this
would be an embarrassment

32:58.476 --> 33:00.561
to let him in on other than
ordinary immigration grounds.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.479
(knocking on door)

33:04.816 --> 33:05.650
Captain.

33:06.943 --> 33:07.777
Please.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.572
I sense you are a very kind man.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.575
I'm appealing to your personal mercy.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.411
How can I help you?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.706
I would like the permission
to speak with Tcherchenko.

33:20.748 --> 33:23.668
I'm afraid we can't do that
until we determine his status.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.754
But his desire to defect is not genuine.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.339
Please believe me.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.466
Tcherchenko's problem is with me.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.678
Uh, we have to take him
at his word, ma'am.

33:34.887 --> 33:37.015
But he'll change his word
in three or five days

33:37.098 --> 33:38.558
and then he and I and Konstantin,

33:38.641 --> 33:40.852
all of us
are going to be in very big difficulty.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.438
That's why no one
has called the embassy yet.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.981
We would speak in English.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.025
We'll have nothing to hide.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.825
I'm no expert.
What do we have to lose here?

33:55.908 --> 33:58.036
You said yourself,
the guy could be an embarrassment.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.416
I'd have to be there.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.251
Fine.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.839
(sirens blaring)

34:21.476 --> 34:22.310
Then what happened?

34:22.935 --> 34:24.729
He said we tried to poison it.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.315
Mainly just parts and water, you know?

34:28.316 --> 34:30.026
And then he started screaming, and...

34:30.610 --> 34:32.320
Maynard went to try to calm him down...

34:33.738 --> 34:37.158
and the boy picked up
the big cutting knife and stabbed him.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.787
All right. All right.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.706
Maynard had his hands up,
he was trying to keep him off.

34:44.582 --> 34:47.126
But the boy just kept stabbing him
and stabbing him.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.421
(tires squeal)

34:51.881 --> 34:53.633
Right through here. Excuse me, folks.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.301
-What happened?
-He's dead.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.678
-Who?
-Maynard. Some crazy guy stabbed him.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.848
-Tall guy with a dog? Guy with a dog?
-He had a dog, yeah.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.684
-What happened, Belker?
-Somebody stabbed Maynard.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.771
146 Walnut.
They have him cornered in a basement.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.189
-He's got a gun.
-Renko!

35:09.440 --> 35:11.943
(siren blaring)

35:18.449 --> 35:19.367
We got a look.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.369
-You went down there?
-Yeah.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.079
-Did he fire?
-Yeah, one shot.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.500
-Tyrone?
-BOBBY: Tyrone Crane.

35:29.335 --> 35:32.588
-Tyrone.
-TYRONE: Leave me alone!

35:32.672 --> 35:34.215
Tyrone, we don't want to hurt you.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.969
Just throw out the gun.
We know you're upset.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.138
We want to get you some help.

35:40.721 --> 35:41.639
Watch it! Watch it!

35:42.223 --> 35:43.641
-(barking)
-Run away, dog. Run!

35:43.724 --> 35:44.934
HENRY: Tyrone, stop it.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.812
-(gunshots)
-Tyrone!

35:49.480 --> 35:50.481
Fire!

35:53.192 --> 35:54.068
(whines)

35:54.152 --> 35:55.069
That looks clean.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.335
(dog barking)

36:12.086 --> 36:13.337
(whines)

36:21.470 --> 36:24.098
Soon it can all be too late.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.185
I don't care.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.937
You're just saying that.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.107
-You don't think of consequences, Mischa.
-I think of them.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.610
Perhaps it is you who do not.

36:36.861 --> 36:37.695
Explain.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.158
Perhaps it is you who do not.

36:43.826 --> 36:44.660
I say it.

36:45.703 --> 36:48.789
Let us speak frankly
while we still have this chance.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.875
I have said so. Finish.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.631
Does this concern love?

36:57.798 --> 36:59.759
Does it concern Konstantin?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.761
You slept with that snake!

37:02.136 --> 37:03.679
That cold fraud!

37:05.097 --> 37:06.849
Mischa, please forgive me.

37:07.099 --> 37:09.602
-I love only you.
-No, you do not love me.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.897
We have difficulties, I know.
We can resolve this.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.650
Konstantin understands my love for you.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.361
-He understands no--
-How could you?

37:18.444 --> 37:22.031
(speaking Russian)

37:38.631 --> 37:41.342
(in English) Mischa,
but we can still try to resolve this.

37:42.301 --> 37:44.595
You and I alone.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.430
No Konstantin.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.015
What was the Russian?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.726
-Uh, it's a bit personal.
-It involves Konstantin?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.187
Which is KGB. Let us speak Frankly.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.190
Konstantin? Excuse me.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.400
(speaks Russian)

38:00.945 --> 38:02.154
What was the Russian?

38:03.239 --> 38:07.159
Uh, guy's got a little problem
in the sack.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.038
Too prompt.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.209
That was the word he used, too prompt.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.131
Nothing to defect about.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.510
Manaspili. Excuse me, sir.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.555
I've just heard
of your occupational assignment.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.309
I'll have to ask you
to remain in Officer Ballantine's company

38:31.392 --> 38:33.019
for the duration of your stay.

38:35.730 --> 38:36.981
She is back with him?

38:39.108 --> 38:39.942
Excuse me?

38:42.069 --> 38:42.903
Ludmilla.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.365
She has reconciled with Tcherchenko?

38:49.201 --> 38:50.036
Um...

38:50.953 --> 38:53.456
That seems to be the drift of things, yes.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.712
(chuckles)
Hey, there's plenty of tuna in the sea.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.508
(speaking Russian)

39:11.932 --> 39:14.393
(in English) I do not wish to defect now.

39:15.269 --> 39:16.228
I am sorry.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.149
I wish only to continue
our tour of America.

39:20.941 --> 39:24.070
If it is possible for this not to become
an international incident,

39:24.153 --> 39:26.197
we would very grateful, Captain.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.075
No one of us
would wish to tell our government.

39:29.700 --> 39:33.371
I can't guarantee the press, Ms. Moros,
but I have no hotline to your embassy.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.373
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

39:35.998 --> 39:36.832
You're welcome.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.762
Hey, Rob. Peg.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.972
How you doing? How are you?

39:52.723 --> 39:55.142
I brought Peg down here
so you could explain to her, J.D.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.060
Explain what?

39:56.352 --> 39:59.647
Somebody telephoned and told her
that I'd been arrested in a police sweep.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.899
Somebody told you that?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.276
He wouldn't give me his name. (sniffles)

40:05.236 --> 40:08.489
He said Rob made a filthy request.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.283
I couldn't believe it,
but then when I called here

40:11.367 --> 40:12.701
they said he'd been arrested.

40:13.327 --> 40:16.163
I told her it had to be some kind
of street scum.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.998
Somebody who'd do anything for five bucks.

40:18.791 --> 40:22.253
You know, you're probably right.
Hey, it was probably a practical joke.

40:22.336 --> 40:24.171
It is not a practical joke.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.091
The khaki officer told me.

40:31.011 --> 40:32.805
-Have vision problems, J.D.?
-Yeah.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.348
Tell her they'll clear up.

40:35.057 --> 40:36.851
You mean tell her?

40:37.101 --> 40:38.144
Tell her, J.D.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.314
You got some guts, Rob. Hey, this guy.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.191
This guy trusts you all the way, Peg.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.568
Now, baby...

40:47.111 --> 40:48.571
you got to swear not to tell.

40:50.030 --> 40:50.948
-Okay.
-Okay.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.452
It's-it's an ongoing police action.

40:55.494 --> 40:58.247
Now, we've been worried that maybe
some of the female undercover vice

40:58.330 --> 41:00.541
were, like, freelancing.
You know what I mean?

41:00.624 --> 41:03.043
Like trying to pick up
a couple extra bucks on the side.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.504
Now, the chief wanted us
to find some outside faces

41:05.588 --> 41:08.299
to pretend they were johns.
You know what I mean?

41:08.382 --> 41:10.968
Guys that there was no chance
the vice cops could recognize.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.971
Heaven help me, I thought of Rob.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.059
Rob, the chief wants to give you
a commendation.

41:19.768 --> 41:22.021
I only hope the cost hasn't been too high.

41:23.397 --> 41:26.066
You can imagine what I thought, J.D.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.819
Hell, yeah.
Hey, it's what we wanted them to think.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.865
Go wash your face now, all right?

41:36.452 --> 41:39.663
-A million laughs, LaRue.
-Okay, take it easy, Marty.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.541
If I see you on the street, pal,
you just better have your stuff together.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.211
-Get strict with me.
-I'll bust you right now!

41:45.294 --> 41:46.295
Baby, hey.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.007
-You think it's funny?
-Hell, no.

41:51.050 --> 41:54.720
Marty, it's been a rotten day.
Let's-let's just go get some dinner.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.388
Okay?

41:58.933 --> 42:01.101
-Come on.
-Okay.

42:03.938 --> 42:04.939
Used Cutlass.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.857
Three year lease, no maintenance.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.984
Bitch and I'll put a bomb in it.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.655
Where do I find this?

42:12.738 --> 42:13.572
Brown, out front.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.115
Hey, you're a sweetheart.

42:16.158 --> 42:17.368
See you kids, huh?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.203
Baby.

42:24.750 --> 42:25.834
You have all your possessions?

42:25.918 --> 42:28.337
Yes, thank you. And we must say again

42:28.420 --> 42:31.298
we are deeply sorry
for your friend Maynard.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.634
Freedom sometimes exacts horrible prices.

42:33.717 --> 42:37.263
Captain, I hope
you do not think we're clowns

42:37.346 --> 42:39.807
in the face of such a sad loss

42:39.890 --> 42:42.893
to be taking up your time
with what seem to you

42:42.977 --> 42:44.728
such a foolish quarrel.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.815
Of course not.
I hope you two can work out your problems.

42:47.898 --> 42:48.857
-We'll try.
-(dog barks)

42:48.941 --> 42:49.817
Good luck.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.861
Come on. See, it's nice in here.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.573
JOE:
You don't think he's got fleas, do you?

42:55.656 --> 42:59.285
No, forget about it. Oh, good boy.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.494
(whining)

43:01.161 --> 43:03.163
-I'm gonna keep him.
-Yeah?

43:03.247 --> 43:04.832
-Yeah.
-What are you gonna name him?

43:05.332 --> 43:08.002
Sarge. Then at least
one of us will have rank.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.721
God, Frank, what did I do?

43:23.976 --> 43:26.604
-It's all right.
-Oh, it's not all right.

43:28.355 --> 43:30.441
One of my clients committed a murder.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.735
You don't have a crystal ball, Joyce.

43:33.527 --> 43:34.528
None of us has.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.823
Maynard was such a sweet man.

43:38.991 --> 43:39.867
And he's gone.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.077
And it's tragic.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.622
And I got the man released who killed him.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.123
In conscience...

43:47.416 --> 43:48.834
and with good intensions,

43:49.668 --> 43:52.546
and I'm sure with compassion
and concern for his welfare.

43:57.343 --> 44:00.638
I called his doctor.
His doctor thought he'd be all right.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.015
So did you.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.851
It's what you hoped.
It's what everybody hoped.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.603
What else can we do, Joyce?

44:15.235 --> 44:17.696
(siren wailing)

44:27.414 --> 44:30.042
(indistinct radio chatter)

44:35.339 --> 44:37.049
Look like a candidate to you, Sarge?

44:39.760 --> 44:41.679
I got a little feeling about this one.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.309
Hurry, baby's coming now.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.562
Hurry up, the baby's coming. Hurry.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.773
You go ahead, I'll be right with you.

44:56.485 --> 45:02.366
Unit four request police assistance,
619 Michigan. Request backup.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.868
LOUIS:
Okay, okay, okay. Is somebody with her?

45:04.952 --> 45:06.954
MAN:
Yeah, her sister, but you've got to hurry.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.582
Be cool.

45:11.583 --> 45:14.169
-Be cool.
-Easy, easy. Just tell us what to do.

45:14.253 --> 45:16.338
You, get the keys. Drop the boxes.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.466
-All we want is your stuff, man.
-MICK: All right, just take it easy.

45:19.550 --> 45:20.676
MAN: No talking.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.847
-No talking. No talking.
-(siren wailing)

45:25.639 --> 45:27.433
Jimmy! Jimmy!

45:32.187 --> 45:33.313
(gunshot)

45:33.814 --> 45:34.648
Curtis!

45:39.737 --> 45:41.155
Hurry, come on, move!

45:43.115 --> 45:43.949
You drive.

45:44.992 --> 45:45.826
Move it!

45:46.076 --> 45:48.871
(siren wailing)

45:55.085 --> 45:56.670
-CURTIS: It hurts.
-I know, man.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.088
Take it easy.

45:58.964 --> 46:00.674
I got you now, man. I got you now.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.552
Nobody dies, man. Nobody dies.

46:09.391 --> 46:11.852
-He's bleeding bad. Go!
-(growls)

46:13.896 --> 46:15.355
I got you, man. I got you.

46:19.735 --> 46:23.530
-Where are we? Where are we?!
-100th and Dekker!

46:27.242 --> 46:29.369
Come on, Curtis. Hang on.

46:32.873 --> 46:33.707
Hang on.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.418
-Are we there?
-Hold on.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.129
(tires squealing)

46:40.631 --> 46:42.633
I got you. I got you.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.604
He's lost about two units,

46:55.896 --> 46:57.564
but his BP is holding at 100.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.567
-I've got him.
-Pulse about 24.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.653
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.488
No meds, no allergies.

47:13.038 --> 47:15.916
-He gonna be all right?
-He ought to be.

47:21.547 --> 47:22.381
(sighs)

47:23.090 --> 47:25.634
Curtis is my tight.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.219
I know.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.556
I understand that.

47:35.936 --> 47:37.020
I-- (chuckles)

47:37.688 --> 47:39.356
I can't believe you, man.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.608
(laughs) What?

47:42.192 --> 47:45.195
(laughing) You broke my record.

47:47.739 --> 47:48.574
Thanks a lot.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.534
You're welcome.

47:52.035 --> 47:52.953
Thanks, man.

47:56.331 --> 47:58.458
(crying)

48:12.306 --> 48:14.725
(closing theme playing)
