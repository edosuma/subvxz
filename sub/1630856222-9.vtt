Hi, Sharks.
I'm Fred Zwar.

00:55.756 --> 00:59.159

Boy falls in love.

Because girl
is awesome.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.505
But also, the boy's a romantic
who loves to create

01:11.505 --> 01:13.941
these impressive
European-style picnics.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.342

01:15.342 --> 01:18.378
However, that meant the
foundation of our relationship

01:18.378 --> 01:21.515
relied on one
very important thing.

01:42.769 --> 01:47.407
We create real cheese
but made only from plants.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.110
And just like with love,
there is no shortcut.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.046
We spent years mastering the
artisan cheesemaking techniques,

01:53.046 --> 01:55.349
such as culturing
and cave aging,

varieties of cheese,

you have our five
top-selling SKUs.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.216
We have our Brie.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.551
We have our
Honee Pistachio Chèvre,

02:31.551 --> 02:34.855
Sundried Tomato Fromage,
sharp cheddar,

02:34.855 --> 02:36.923
and also our pimento.
Ooh!

02:36.923 --> 02:38.792
Oh, my God, that's so good.
The pimento is wow!

02:38.792 --> 02:40.727
O'Leary:
Is it primarily cashew,

02:40.727 --> 02:43.263
or have you used
multiple plant-based solutions?

02:43.263 --> 02:44.765
We do multiple.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.967
What sets us apart
is our techniques.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.803
So we actually have caves
that we cave-age the Brie in.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.705
Wow.
The Brie is incredible.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.807
Thank you, and it's
just four ingredients.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.243
O'Leary: Okay.
It's cashews, water,
salt, and culture.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.544
So it's super clean.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.146
Oh, my God.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.582
That Sundried Tomato Fromage
is fabulous.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.451
Really good.
O'Leary: I've tried them all.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.686
And I'm a huge cheese guy.
The cheddar is incredible.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.389
I'm a huge wine guy.
So I'm very sensitive.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.725
The one you nailed it on
is the Brie.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.461
There is no way
to tell the difference.
Maitland: Thank you.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.630
I mean, these are interesting,
but the texture's, like,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.532
pretty similar on all of them,
right?

03:18.532 --> 03:22.302
It's kind of very mushy
and pasty.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.604
The texture is throwing me
a little bit.

03:24.604 --> 03:27.774
Kirsten, are you the only one
that makes a vegan cheese?

03:27.774 --> 03:28.975
No.
Greiner: No.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.044
To this level.
Standard.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.345
There aren't
many people

03:32.345 --> 03:34.881
that are making artisan
vegan cheese at scale.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.385
There's no one making
vegan Brie at scale.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.121
We just built
our new production facility.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.457
We can make
8 million wheels a year there.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.726
Wow.
So, guys, you came in
with a pretty punchy ask.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.694
So explain to us
the business model today.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.063
Yes.
So we have three
different channels

03:50.063 --> 03:51.465
that we're selling in
currently.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.533
We have our e-commerce,
which is through subscription.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.902
That entails about 16%
of our business.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.370
We also have
our wholesale program,

03:57.370 --> 03:59.773
which is about
17% of our business,

03:59.773 --> 04:02.709
and then our restaurant,
that is 65% of our business.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.311
Oh, that's interesting.
Herjavec: A single location?

04:04.311 --> 04:05.612
Yes, a single location.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.647
Cuban: What's the restaurant?
Rebel Cheese.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.382
So, during COVID,
we had to pivot,

04:09.382 --> 04:11.718
like every other restaurant
in America.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.987
We pivoted to e-commerce
to start with,

04:13.987 --> 04:16.456
and that started
taking off.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.425
And now we're in
about 100 retailers.

04:18.425 --> 04:21.528
Any of the large majors,
like Whole Foods?
Not yet.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.330
They reached out to us
in the beginning,

04:23.330 --> 04:25.132
but we weren't
ready for them.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.367
Those 100 retailers --
Good for you
for recognizing that.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.902
O'Leary:
What's the price of this

04:28.902 --> 04:31.938
versus a traditional wheel
of high-end Brie?

04:31.938 --> 04:35.041
So it costs us about $4.67
to make that.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.010
And that's after
overhead and labor.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.846
We then landed at the retailer
for about $9,

04:39.846 --> 04:43.383
and then we have an MSRP
about $15 to $20 per wheel.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.152
How does that compare
with real cheese?

04:45.152 --> 04:48.054
Real cheese is anywhere
between $10 to $20.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.523
So we're right there
with them.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.324
Fred, what are
the sales today?

04:51.324 --> 04:54.461
So our last year of sales
were $2.5 million.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.730
This year, we're projecting
to make $3.5 million.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.165
O'Leary: What will
this whole thing make

04:58.165 --> 05:00.567
if you hit the $3.5 million
pretax this year

05:00.567 --> 05:01.635
after you pay yourselves?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.537
So we've been profitable
for four years.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.804
That's what also
sets us apart.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.139
What are you going to make
this year?
Wow.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.874
This year we're hoping to break
even, to be honest with you,

05:07.874 --> 05:09.342
because scaling.
Because of the factory.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.311
Next year,
we want to be in 500 stores,

05:11.311 --> 05:12.979
which will put us
about $7 million

05:12.979 --> 05:14.648
just in
our distribution revenue.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.650
I'm trying to get my head
around the deal,

05:16.650 --> 05:20.754
because the differentiation
for Rebel Cheese

05:20.754 --> 05:24.224
is this extraordinary
leap forward in Brie.

05:24.224 --> 05:27.627
And yet you're asking --
$15 million valuation.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.529
I think you asked
for too much money.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.065
If anybody here
should invest in this, it's me.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.400

05:35.235 --> 05:37.537

thank me now, Mark.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.059
Thanks so much.
Oh, thank you.

08:46.059 --> 08:46.993
Well done, man.
Oh, my God.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.294
So exciting.
Thank you.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.362
It's really exciting.
Thank you so much.

Yeah.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.703

The part
that really got me --

08:58.204 --> 08:59.506
I don't know about Kirsten,
per se --

08:59.506 --> 09:01.341
is where Mark even said
he'll come down to Austin

09:01.341 --> 09:02.642
to hand out samples.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.344
Yeah, we were like,
"Done," after that.
Yeah.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.979
I think Mark
one day will learn

09:05.979 --> 09:07.580
you don't have to
buy the company.

09:07.580 --> 09:08.848
You can just buy the product.
Just be a customer.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.983
Just buy the cheese.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.419

to say, "But it's mine."

Narrator: In Season 11,
Sarah Paiji Yoo and Syed Naqvi

09:17.190 --> 09:18.625
made a deal with Kevin O'Leary

09:18.625 --> 09:21.761
for their eco-friendly cleaning
product company, Blueland.

09:21.761 --> 09:22.962
Done.
Whoo!

09:22.962 --> 09:24.764
Narrator: Let's see
what they're up to now.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.933
Paiji Yoo: Our mission
at Blueland is to make it easy

09:26.933 --> 09:29.102
for everyone to make
more sustainable choices

09:29.102 --> 09:32.005
with products that eliminate
single-use plastic packaging.

09:32.005 --> 09:36.009
We built the foundation of
our online business on Shopify.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.145
The platform made it really easy
to upload a new image

09:39.145 --> 09:40.713
and change the copy
of the text,

09:40.713 --> 09:42.916
and we could do all that
with no engineers.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.317
When our episode aired,

09:44.317 --> 09:48.088
we got more traffic than
we could have ever imagined,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.890
and we did not have to worry
about our site going down.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.560
It continued running
as beautifully as it ever had.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.994
Naqvi: Before "Shark Tank,"
we were in business

09:54.994 --> 09:56.496
for less than two months,

09:56.496 --> 09:58.598
and our sales
were around $200,000.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.567
Since closing our deal
four years ago,

10:00.567 --> 10:03.770
we have done
$170 million in sales.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.873
We're now in Costco,
Target, Erewhon,

10:06.873 --> 10:10.443
and most recently we've launched
nationwide into Whole Foods.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.945
One of the best ways
that we found

10:11.945 --> 10:14.280
at attracting
new customers at retail

10:14.280 --> 10:15.815
is with our plastic swaps.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.251
We invite people to bring in
their cleaning products

10:18.251 --> 10:20.019
and trade it
for one of our products

10:20.019 --> 10:21.788
that can be reused forever.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.891
This is one of the things where
Kevin has gone above and beyond.

10:24.891 --> 10:28.161
He actually held on to all
of his single-use plastic waste

10:28.161 --> 10:29.929
and then decided
to wear it

10:29.929 --> 10:32.098
to show how much
single-use plastic

10:32.098 --> 10:33.933
a single person generates.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.835
O'Leary: There's a whole
generation of people

10:35.835 --> 10:37.871
that don't want to throw
plastic out anymore,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.272
and Blueland solved the problem.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.440
They have the best
of both worlds.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.708
They have direct-to-consumer
business

10:41.708 --> 10:42.909
that's huge and growing,

10:42.909 --> 10:44.844
and retailers are begging
for their product.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.779
Blueland is now a brand.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.615
Celebrating our
five-year anniversary,

10:48.615 --> 10:50.416
Shopify has invited us
to show us

10:50.416 --> 10:52.218
some of their newest
and greatest features.

10:52.218 --> 10:54.687
Shopify has been
an incredible asset

10:54.687 --> 10:56.623
to small businesses
everywhere,

10:56.623 --> 11:00.827
and we would not have been able
to create a business of our size

11:00.827 --> 11:02.795
at the speed
that we were able to do

11:02.795 --> 11:04.497
without a partner
like Shopify.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.299
Using the Shop app
is such a great way

11:06.299 --> 11:08.301
to connect with more customers
for your business.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.969
There's a new feature --
We add Shop Cash

11:09.969 --> 11:11.704
right on the front page,
so you can click here

11:11.704 --> 11:13.740
and see exactly how much
you have to spend.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.408
We are
a one-of-a-kind product,

11:15.408 --> 11:19.178
and Shopify enables us to really
customize the experience

11:19.178 --> 11:22.248
so that our brand and our
mission really shine through.

11:22.248 --> 11:25.718

to go out and make it happen

11:25.718 --> 11:27.587
and to make a difference.

it's especially meaningful

want this to sound silly,

but I went to schools.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.825
I gave out so many samples
of panties, asked feedback --

"Try these on.

in my glove compartment."

14:24.230 --> 14:25.565
What are your sales,
Ashlee?

14:25.565 --> 14:28.000
So I launched
at the end of 2021.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.304
In September 2021,
I sold $8,000,

14:31.304 --> 14:32.472
which recouped
back my investment.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.074
Dollars? Dollars?
$8,000.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.376
$8,000?
So, Ashlee, before you get into
all the details,

14:37.376 --> 14:38.611
tell us about you.
Yeah.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.480
Turner: Sure.
When I was in college,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.315
I started working
in a real-estate company,

14:42.315 --> 14:45.017
got my license,
and I became the closer.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.988
So I would go out for other
agents who had a tough deal.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.491
I tend to be a little bit
more relatable to people,

14:51.491 --> 14:52.825
so it was easy
for me to close.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.160
So I would close my own deals,

14:54.160 --> 14:55.895
and I would be closing
all the agents in the office.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.764
I would be closing 20 deals.
Always be closing.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.565
Always be closing -- ABC.
Greiner: Yeah.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.435
So I left and I went back
to what I knew, which was sales,

15:02.435 --> 15:03.770
but this one right here,
this is my purpose.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.105
How did we get to the panty?
Grede: Exactly.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.374
So what happened here is
I went through a crummy breakup,

15:08.374 --> 15:09.942
as most of these stories start.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.445
I went and got this big
dumb apartment in downtown,

15:12.445 --> 15:14.514
and I was like,
"How am I gonna pay for this?"

15:14.514 --> 15:16.582
And then at that very moment,
heard God say,

15:16.582 --> 15:18.317
"The best ideas
come out of necessity."

15:18.317 --> 15:20.119
And I worked in
property management,

15:20.119 --> 15:21.954
so I would see
the residents come down.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.122
I'm talking to a girl.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.024
She's like, "Oh, I met this guy
on Bumble.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.626
And, you know, last night

15:26.626 --> 15:28.494
was the first night
I decided to spend the night."

15:28.494 --> 15:30.229
And I said, "Oh, really?"
She starts laughing.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.397
I said,
"What are you laughing at?"

15:31.397 --> 15:34.066
She goes, "I just stuffed
some panties in my bag."

15:34.066 --> 15:36.803
And I said, "Oh, girl,
you're my customer.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.438
You are my customer."

15:38.438 --> 15:40.373
And that was it.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.642
And what does one cost, and
what does it cost you to make?

15:42.642 --> 15:45.378
When I first launched,
I was new, I was green,

15:45.378 --> 15:47.480
and I was ordering
in small quantities.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.550
So I negotiated
$2.20 for a pair.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.385
I sell them for $10.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.886
O'Leary: 10 bucks?
And retail?
What about wholesale?

15:53.886 --> 15:55.388
Retail, wholesale, 5 bucks.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.423
For the whole package?
No, for one.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.226
10 bucks for one?

16:00.226 --> 16:02.295
Grede: Where do you make them?
I make them in China.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.696
And where are you
selling right now?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.965
I sell online.
I'm in several boutiques.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.267
I'm in all-girls
private schools.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.636
I'm in some vending machines.
And it's great.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.171
Like, the need is there.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.773
Why don't I just
go buy five pair

16:13.773 --> 16:18.110
and stuff one, just like
your friend did, in my purse?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.046
Why "Shark Tank," Ashlee?

16:20.046 --> 16:23.649
Well, so this is like
a dream, like,

16:23.649 --> 16:27.620
that I could have
never imagined.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.288
Full transparency,
I'm a black woman,

16:29.288 --> 16:31.791
and we don't get
this many opportunities.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.094
Since 2018, black women
businesses have tripled,

16:35.094 --> 16:38.664
yet we get 0.27%
of venture capital dollars.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.066
We don't get
these opportunities.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.334
So this is like --

16:41.334 --> 16:43.436
Whatever the outcome is today,

16:43.436 --> 16:47.607
I'm doing it for other women
that look just like me

16:47.607 --> 16:48.975
that just don't get this --

16:48.975 --> 16:50.576
This is surreal.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.546
Oh, good for you.
You said you did $8,000.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.047
That was in '21.
So where are you now?

16:55.047 --> 16:56.215
Paint the picture for us.
That was in 2021.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.184
My total sales are $60,000.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.352
$60,000.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.420
Ashlee, do you do anything
on social media?

17:01.420 --> 17:03.890
So...

17:03.890 --> 17:05.992
Social media is just not
my wheelhouse, so again --

17:05.992 --> 17:07.260
Because you're a star.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.762
You come up with
all these great sayings, right?

17:09.762 --> 17:11.264

That is what would sell.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.199

You're a salesperson.

Greiner: Honestly, Ashlee,
I just personally think

17:17.203 --> 17:19.438
there are better people
on this panel here

17:19.438 --> 17:21.574
to help you with this product
than myself.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.076
I wish you good luck.
I will purchase.

But unfortunately,
I'm out.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.582

a powerhouse.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.784
There's nothing about you

17:31.784 --> 17:35.554
that doesn't
instill confidence in me,

17:35.554 --> 17:39.892
but the aura and the energy
of Ashlee

17:39.892 --> 17:42.228
doesn't match the sales.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.163

to understand why.

isn't anything you would do

telling me it's not selling,

can sell it, you could.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.423
Ashlee, the hard part
about this product

18:10.423 --> 18:12.825
is the impulse buy,
right,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.126

when they need it,

18:14.126 --> 18:18.064

of social media.

you gave us on TikTok,

18:23.602 --> 18:26.973
on Instagram, and then saying,
"Buy it at wherever,"

18:26.973 --> 18:31.110

that is what sells this product.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.579
You are
a great salesperson,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.848
but the only place
that that's going to come across

18:35.848 --> 18:39.118
and allow you to sell
your product is on social media.

18:39.118 --> 18:44.790

that you won't go, I'm out.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.977
You are
an excellent saleswoman.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.147
And the idea that you are
just not tearing it up

19:08.147 --> 19:10.750
on social media
is almost maddening to me,

19:10.750 --> 19:14.587
because it's like, if anyone
can sell this product, it's you.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.821
You are it.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.723
You told us as you came out here
why we all need this.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.258
And I was like,
"Oh, yeah, absolutely.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.526
I want to go back
to SKIMS now

19:20.526 --> 19:22.628
and put a pair of panties
in a pack and sell them."

19:22.628 --> 19:24.363
And that is
your big problem,

19:24.363 --> 19:27.733
because any of the big
underwear companies out there

19:27.733 --> 19:30.803
can take what they do
with all of their scale

19:30.803 --> 19:33.506
and offer you this at
what you want to pay for it,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.074
which is $3.99, right?

19:35.074 --> 19:36.976
That's what I really
want to pay for this.

your big issue.

to dissuade you,

19:40.279 --> 19:42.548
because you will
be successful.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.316
But you've got to
actually take this

19:44.316 --> 19:45.584
and go one step further.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.486
For me right now, this is --
No, Emma, no, no, no.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.455
No, no, no, it's not
an investable opportunity

19:49.455 --> 19:50.723

But that doesn't mean to say
that you can't get it there.

You've got
some more work to do.
Sure.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.296
You've got to convince
every woman in this country

19:57.296 --> 19:59.432

to go out and order this

19:59.432 --> 20:01.567

just for safekeeping.

That's a good question.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.884
Well,
it's a great question.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.454
We continually reinvested in
our business hiring good people.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.322
We take salaries.
Yeah.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.490
We have good benefits.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.893
And we we plow our money
back into the company.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.327
What are your salaries?
What are your salaries?

26:02.327 --> 26:04.396
Salaries
are $150,000 each.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.031
So, where's the money going,
right?

26:06.031 --> 26:07.466
So there's only
a couple places

26:07.466 --> 26:09.068
you can spend
that much revenue, right?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.636
Yeah, there's something
called COVID that happened.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.070
So last year, we had --
Alright, fair enough.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.273
You know, we had a lot
of non-recurring expenses

26:14.273 --> 26:15.674
that we're not going to
have this year.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.644
Year to date, the first four
months, we lost $100,000

26:18.644 --> 26:21.814
because we went to about
13 trade shows around the U.S.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.682
It's very heavy
expense side.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.551
So, I mean, the marketing
that we spend

26:25.551 --> 26:27.786
is really on building
and expanding our business.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.521
We have a philosophy
which is important

26:29.521 --> 26:32.925
about trying to use one pool of
inventory for multiple channels.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.493
So how much do you have
in inventory?

26:34.493 --> 26:36.028
1,500,000 right now.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.696
Ron, tell me,
how did you come up with this?

26:37.696 --> 26:39.064
I'm really curious
to understand

26:39.064 --> 26:40.766
the origin story
a little bit more.

26:40.766 --> 26:41.934
It was 2015.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.002
I went on a trip to Burgundy
with my wife,

26:44.002 --> 26:45.871
went to some great wineries,

26:45.871 --> 26:47.306
and every place we went,
we said,

26:47.306 --> 26:48.674
"We want to ship
the wine home."

26:48.674 --> 26:50.843
They said, "Well, you can take
the wine physically yourself

26:50.843 --> 26:53.245
and bring it to Mail Box Etc
in Beaune,

26:53.245 --> 26:55.314
a little village
in Burgundy."

26:55.314 --> 26:56.915
And so ultimately
that's what we did.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.485
We shipped it back home.
It took 45 days.

26:59.485 --> 27:02.287
Wow.
Who knows what happened
to the quality of the wine?

27:02.287 --> 27:06.058
But I decided, there's got to be
a product out there somewhere

27:06.058 --> 27:07.459
that solves this problem.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.195
And so I researched it,
and I found a guy in New Mexico

27:10.195 --> 27:13.832
who'd come up with the idea
of version one of the suitcase.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.502
And so I was able to negotiate,
eventually, a deal with him

27:16.502 --> 27:18.670
for exclusivity
in the wine industry.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.039
And so at that point,
I reached out to Ryan,

27:21.039 --> 27:23.041
who used to work for me
at a prior company.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.911
And we started the company.
So, Ron, you're licensing
this idea from someone else.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.280
This is not actually
your product and your idea.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.781
Well, it's our product.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.651
So, we have an investor who's
our manufacturer, our importer

27:32.651 --> 27:34.553
and manages
our supply chain.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.456
She bought out the original
inventor, all the IP,

27:37.456 --> 27:39.158
all the assets,
and everything.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.792
She then invested
in our company,

27:40.792 --> 27:43.829
owns 20% of our company,
so it's a strategic investment.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.664
There's no other financial
relationship with her,

27:45.664 --> 27:47.933
just straight 20%?
Just 20%.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.035
She doesn't allow
anybody else to use the patent

27:50.035 --> 27:51.036
or to make this product?

27:51.036 --> 27:52.838
We have exclusivity
worldwide.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.306
Does your company
own the patent,

27:54.306 --> 27:55.374
or does she own the patent?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.242
She owns the patent
on the suitcase.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.145
We jointly applied this year
for the patent on the backpack.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.180
How long is the agreement
in place for?

28:02.180 --> 28:03.182
10 years.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.883
What happens at the end?

28:04.883 --> 28:07.419
There's an evergreen thing
that allows us to renew,

28:07.419 --> 28:08.987
I mean,
at that point in time.

28:08.987 --> 28:11.223
What does it cost you to make,
and what do you sell it for?

28:11.223 --> 28:13.058
What a great question.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.562
The Grande 12-bottle
is $379.95.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.131
The eight-bottle
is $339.95.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.167
And the five-bottle Piccolo
is $289.95.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.636
It's reasonable.
And the margins
are 60% to 62%.

28:24.636 --> 28:27.439
The backpack retails
for $199.95.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.408
Ooh.
It has a 71% margin on it.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.343
About 400 to 500 wineries

28:31.343 --> 28:33.178
carry it in their tasting room
or have bought it.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.680
But, you know,
the last 12 months,

28:34.680 --> 28:36.548
we did $3.4 million
on Amazon.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.250
Just on Amazon?
Wow.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.285
We sell about --
You know, on our own website,

28:40.285 --> 28:43.188
we do about 13%, 14%,
as well.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.356
And then
wholesale's about --

28:44.356 --> 28:46.525
this year will be probably
40% of our business.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.895
Look, guys, I just think
it's a hard business to scale

28:49.895 --> 28:51.663
to the level
of profitability

28:51.663 --> 28:53.565
that makes it work
for me as an investor.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.567
So for those reasons,
I'm out.
Alright.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.069
Hey, Ron,
just so I'm clear,

28:57.069 --> 29:00.172
you can only buy
the product from her.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.040
Only she can manufacture it.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.910
Yes, only she can
manufacture certain products.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.079
If we come out
with a new product --
No, I got it.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.947
But your number-one product,
the suitcase,

29:08.947 --> 29:10.415
you can only buy from her.
Yeah, she manufactures.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.418
In my world, in tech world,
I would call you an integrator

29:13.418 --> 29:15.654
or a VAR,
value-added reseller.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.289
There's nothing
wrong with that.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.258
The problem is,
as an investor,

29:19.258 --> 29:21.393
I don't think you're going to
scale to the point

29:21.393 --> 29:22.594
where I'm going to
make my money back.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.730
So somebody would have to
sell the business,

29:24.730 --> 29:26.498
and it goes back
to the problem --

29:26.498 --> 29:31.536
You actually aren't aligned with
the people that own your IP.

29:31.536 --> 29:32.971
As long as she's
making the stuff

29:32.971 --> 29:36.174
and you guys are holding
inventory, she's making money.

29:36.174 --> 29:38.110
You only make it
on the sell-through.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.811
Great business for you guys.
Keep going.

29:39.811 --> 29:43.148
And I appreciate the drink,
but as an investment, I'm out.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.549
Appreciate
the comments.

29:44.549 --> 29:46.685
To me, there does feel like
there's real disalignment

29:46.685 --> 29:49.621
between you
and your primary investor.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.858
What you should have done is
tried to reduce the complexity

29:52.858 --> 29:55.027
before coming in here
and talking to us.
Mm-hmm.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.963

29:57.963 --> 29:59.765

magnificent sales.

You've done such great traction.
I see the need for it.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.672
But there's something going on

30:06.672 --> 30:09.641
as to why you're not actually
making more money

30:09.641 --> 30:11.510
to the bottom line,
more profitable.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.979
And that concerns me.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.448
And so I'm so sorry,
but I'm out.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.316
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:18.316 --> 30:23.522
So, guys, let me explain
why this is a difficult deal

30:23.522 --> 30:24.990
from a different perspective.

30:24.990 --> 30:28.293
In nature,
very successful parasites

30:28.293 --> 30:29.961
never kill their host.

30:29.961 --> 30:33.198
Your manufacturer is a parasite,
and you're the host.

30:33.198 --> 30:36.268
And she controls how much money
you make every year.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.970
What you could be doing
and what I would be doing

30:38.970 --> 30:42.140
is be looking for a different
price point on these

30:42.140 --> 30:44.710
and probably find a way
to save 15%, 20%.

30:44.710 --> 30:48.447
But I can't because the IP
is tied to the manufacturing,

30:48.447 --> 30:52.017
and I understand the symbiotic
parasitic relationship,

30:52.017 --> 30:53.752
but it's going to
make it impossible

30:53.752 --> 30:56.421
to get an investor
for $500,000.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.290
You know,
that's a lot of dough.
Right.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.492
And I'd like to --
I got to make back $5 million.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.694
I mean, after all,
I'm an investor and I don't --

31:02.694 --> 31:04.229
There's no way to get it back.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.765
You'd have to sell the company
for 150 million bucks.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.434
Well, you could make it as part
of a royalty deal, as well.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.569
You get your money back
earlier.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.646
Ta-da!

34:07.646 --> 34:09.247
Greiner: Won't fall off?
O'Leary: Cools the dome.

34:09.247 --> 34:10.482
Greiner: It cools?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.717
We do you recommend CAKES
under snug-fitting tops,

34:12.717 --> 34:14.753
like a bodysuit
or a bralette?

34:14.753 --> 34:16.187
Yeah, just in case.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.756
Herjavec: Right.
Yeah, and they're grippy,
not sticky.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.991
And as you sweat
and produce body heat,

34:19.991 --> 34:21.660
they actually grip
even better.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.496
Thank you so much for being
such a good sport.
Thank you, thank you.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.598
They don't call you
Mr. Wonderful for nothing.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.867
Who knew?
Herjavec: They do, actually.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.502
There's no reason.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.237
Greiner: Well, it's
really interesting to me.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.673
I mean, I put on my arm.
It is comfortable.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.174
It's light.
I barely feel it.

34:36.174 --> 34:37.375
I have to also ask.
Awesome.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.778
I want to know about you
and your backgrounds.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.146
And are you twins?

34:41.146 --> 34:42.147
Yes.
We are.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.549
We started our business
very simply.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.084
We were like,
"We need this solution.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.153
Let's see if anyone else
will buy it."

34:48.153 --> 34:50.155
So we both were working
in corporate

34:50.155 --> 34:51.790
for the last 10 years.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.158
Things were going great.

34:53.158 --> 34:56.027
And I don't know if this was a
sign from the universe or what,

34:56.027 --> 34:58.630
but we were both on the verge
of a layoff at the same time.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.700
Greiner and Grede: Wow.
And that was really
when we were like,

35:01.700 --> 35:04.369
"Do we want to look
for another job?"
The nipple came to the rescue.

35:04.369 --> 35:06.271
Nipple covers.
Nipple covers.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.973
That's it.
Nipple freak-out.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.541
Who knew it was a big problem?

35:09.541 --> 35:10.976
Grede: But, guys,
there's so much competition.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.044
I really want to know
what makes yours better.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.679
This is a saturated market.
Better than what?

35:14.679 --> 35:15.914
Well, there's everything,
right?

35:15.914 --> 35:17.682
There's tape.
There's silicone patches.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.417
There's Band-Aid-type
situations.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.885
Herjavec: Wow.
But what makes this unique?

35:20.885 --> 35:23.054
It's crazy.
When we first started,

35:23.054 --> 35:24.489
there was no one
necessarily owning,

35:24.489 --> 35:26.858
like, the boob accessory
and solution space.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.960
There's a boob
accessory space?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.829
There's a boob solution space.
I'm in it.

35:30.829 --> 35:33.198
When we first started,
we designed the solution

35:33.198 --> 35:34.766
that didn't exist for us.

35:34.766 --> 35:37.202
In our case, we wanted
something extremely seamless

35:37.202 --> 35:38.870
that didn't poke
through our clothes.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.805
Typically, what we were finding
on the market

35:40.805 --> 35:42.874
was a lot smaller
and thicker.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.342
So ours is thick
in the center,

35:44.342 --> 35:46.978
but it tapers to almost nothing
at the edges.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.514
So you get
a seam-free situation.
Yeah.

35:49.514 --> 35:52.584
Oh, well,
that's a good point.
Well, you guys came in with
a $6 million valuation, right?

35:52.584 --> 35:55.420
So you must have sales.
Tell us about the business.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.890
We started with only $10,000
from our savings,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.893
zero dollars in marketing
our first year, no investors,

36:01.893 --> 36:03.595
and in our first year
of business,

36:03.595 --> 36:04.729
we did $1 million
in revenue.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.564
Together: Wow!

36:06.564 --> 36:08.566
Year to date,
in the last five months...
Wow.

36:08.566 --> 36:10.368
...we've done $1.5 million

36:10.368 --> 36:12.937
and are projecting to end
the year at $5 million.

36:12.937 --> 36:13.938
Wow.
Wow!

36:13.938 --> 36:15.073
Good for you two.
That's insane.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.975
So you must be profitable,
then, too, right?

36:16.975 --> 36:20.345
We are operating
at a 35% net profit margin.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.948
So last year, we did
about 300K in net profit.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.884
And this year,
we've done over 500K.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.752
Good for you two.
You're amazing.
Both: Wow.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.954
Tell us how you're
selling, then, yeah.
Where are you selling it?

36:29.954 --> 36:33.458
Last year, 90% of our revenue
came from organic TikTok

36:33.458 --> 36:35.260
at a zero-dollar
customer acquisition cost.
Good for you.

36:35.260 --> 36:36.761
Wow.
Yeah, that is awesome.

36:36.761 --> 36:37.862
Herjavec: That's incredible.
That's amazing.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.831
Guys, let me ask you
a tougher question.

36:39.831 --> 36:42.333
What happens if TikTok
gets shut down or diminished?

36:42.333 --> 36:44.402
Our focus for the first half
of this year was,

36:44.402 --> 36:46.704
how do we diversify
where revenue?
Smart.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.541
We were able to take
our winners from TikTok,

36:49.541 --> 36:50.875
put them on paid channels,

36:50.875 --> 36:53.812
and they're extremely efficient,
doing much better.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.547
What's the return?

36:55.547 --> 36:58.516
Our ROAS on paid ads
is over a 5X.

36:58.516 --> 36:59.684
Grede: Wow.
Herjavec: 5X?

36:59.684 --> 37:00.885
O'Leary: 5X?
Amazing.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.487
So, Taylor,
what's the cost of the product?

37:02.487 --> 37:05.056
Yeah, what is the cost,
and what do you sell them for?

37:05.056 --> 37:08.293
Our costs landed are $8,
and we sell them for $30.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.195
So we're at
a 75-ish percent.
Yeah, good for you.

37:10.195 --> 37:14.499
Nice. I want to know,
why do you need a Shark?

37:14.499 --> 37:17.869
We feel like we're just
at the beginning.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.571
We've been able to get it
to this point,

37:19.571 --> 37:22.073
but we're smart enough to know
that we need the expertise

37:22.073 --> 37:24.943
of taking this
from a single-product company

37:24.943 --> 37:28.847
to an actual brand with lasting
power and staying power.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.150
And truly solving problems
that women are facing.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.685
We started with $10,000.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.954
We weren't able to launch
a whole line,

37:35.954 --> 37:36.988
and also,
we wouldn't have known --

37:36.988 --> 37:38.389
You're lucky.
That saved you.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.758
Let me give you some advice.
Oh. Thank you.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.060
What I would suggest --
talk to your customers,

37:42.060 --> 37:43.595
'cause that's
what you do best,

37:43.595 --> 37:45.230
and let them tell you
what they're going to buy

37:45.230 --> 37:46.798
and what they're
going to order.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.433
You have to always know
what business you're in

37:48.433 --> 37:49.901
and what you're great at,

37:49.901 --> 37:52.103
and you're great
at marketing on social.
Thank you. Thank you.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.471
And so you've got to
play that.

37:53.471 --> 37:56.241
Unfortunately --
So many things I could say.

37:56.241 --> 37:57.842
[ Laughter ]

37:57.842 --> 38:00.712
But unfortunately, it's not
really my wheelhouse.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.080
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.481
Thank you.
We love what you do.
Thank you.

38:03.481 --> 38:04.482
Thank you so much.
And thank you.

38:04.482 --> 38:05.483
Cuban: Thank you.

38:05.483 --> 38:07.452
What I love
about "Shark Tank"

38:07.452 --> 38:10.088
is you learn about stuff
you didn't even know.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.790
NFO, who knew?
Who knew?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.259
Boob accessory market,
who knew?

38:14.259 --> 38:15.794
Cuban: Who knew?

38:15.794 --> 38:20.365
Right, I like to think I know
a little bit about everything,

38:20.365 --> 38:23.168
but I may have hit an industry
I know nothing about.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.302
Not for me. I'm out.
Thank you.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.804
Thank you so much.
We look up to you so much.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.672
So thank you.
Thank you. Amazing.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.340
Ladies, I actually
think you're more

38:29.340 --> 38:31.609
than just really good
marketeers.

38:31.609 --> 38:34.512
I think that you are
really early in this business,

38:34.512 --> 38:36.080
and I've seen
so many businesses

38:36.080 --> 38:39.317
where you get that
early groundswell, you know,

38:39.317 --> 38:40.818
and it's like
TikTok's on fire.

38:40.818 --> 38:44.756
But it isn't a business
until you've figured out,

38:44.756 --> 38:47.058
how many ways
can you find that customer?

38:47.058 --> 38:48.760
Yeah.
And right now you're
going through one channel.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.728
There's a huge opportunity
for this in wholesale

38:50.728 --> 38:52.197
and more traditional retail

38:52.197 --> 38:53.965
if you choose
to go down that way,

38:53.965 --> 38:55.767
and I think there's
a ton more products you can do.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.635
So with all of that
being said,

38:57.635 --> 38:59.304
I'm actually going to
give you guys an offer.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.505
Herjavec: Ooh.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.451
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Emma is interested

39:13.451 --> 39:17.021
in Casey and Taylor's nipple
solution business, CAKES Body.

39:17.021 --> 39:21.125
Grede: You came in asking
for $300,000 for 5%,

39:21.125 --> 39:23.494
and I'll happily
give you $300,000,

39:23.494 --> 39:26.798
but I want 12.5%
of the business.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.235
First of all, we can't
thank you enough for the offer.

39:30.235 --> 39:34.572
You're a queen, our icon.
Lori, also the QVC queen.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.174
Wait a second. What am I,
chopped liver over here?

39:36.174 --> 39:38.042
Mr. Wonderful,
the best sport.
Basically.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.544
You're a queen,
too, Kevin.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.012
O'Leary: Well, look,
I may have an offer, too,

39:41.012 --> 39:42.614
same time adding
a little boost.
You got a great offer, guys.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.115
You have
a really good offer.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.850
Wait a second.
Let me put an offer out there

39:45.850 --> 39:48.319
that doesn't cost you as much,
because I find her very greedy.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.255
Okay? 12.5% is very selfish
of her.

39:50.255 --> 39:51.823
What's my name?
Mrs. Grede.
Right? Exactly.

39:51.823 --> 39:56.194
So I will offer you
the $300,000 at the 5%.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.662
But if I ever saw a product

39:57.662 --> 39:59.464
that could handle a royalty,
it's this.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.533
So I would like a dollar per set

40:02.533 --> 40:03.935
until I get back
a million bucks.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.170
That's just over 3X
on my investment,

40:06.170 --> 40:08.339
and I'll keep the 5% equity
to just,

40:08.339 --> 40:09.807
you know, help you build it.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.210
We'll sell it one day
to a behemoth.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.679
I think Emma's -- she's
wonderful, but she's greedy.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.748
I'll be greedy for you, too.
It's disgusting.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.883
12.5% equity.
It's ridiculous.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.451
Here's the thing.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.920
I have built businesses
in this space

40:22.920 --> 40:25.223
to be worth billions
and billions of dollars.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.625
You want to build
a giant business,

40:27.625 --> 40:29.360
and I can actually
help you do that.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.962
Not because I'm talking about
it, because I'm doing it...
Well -- Excuse me.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.130
So what are you
waiting on, guys?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.132
...over and over and over again
in this space.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.467
Mr. Wonderful,
thank you so much.

40:36.467 --> 40:39.504
Those are two
very interesting offers.

40:39.504 --> 40:41.239
Where do you see,
from a partnership --
Oh, my goodness.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.341
Oh, my gosh.
Casey, he knows nothing.
Oh, my goodness.

40:43.341 --> 40:45.543
You're actually
asking him questions?
It's a valid question.

40:45.543 --> 40:47.445
When you have Emma Grede
right here,

40:47.445 --> 40:48.980
who's done this
multiple times.
Excuse me, Mark.

40:48.980 --> 40:49.981
May I answer?

40:49.981 --> 40:51.649
This is early,
to Emma's point.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.885
And so we want to make sure
it's worth your time.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.954
I would love to be able
to just put the money

40:55.954 --> 40:58.389
back into the business
as much as we can

40:58.389 --> 40:59.691
to grow it
as much as we can,

40:59.691 --> 41:03.094
so the royalty component
wouldn't work for us.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.929
Why are you still
talking to him, seriously?

41:04.929 --> 41:07.432
No, I'll give you $300,000.
You want to do
a deal with him?

41:07.432 --> 41:09.534
Seriously, why are you
still talking to him?

41:09.534 --> 41:11.869
Guys, what are you
waiting for?

41:11.869 --> 41:13.071
This is our baby.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.907
Obviously we want to keep
as much equity as we can.

41:15.907 --> 41:20.812
As you should.
Would you be willing
to do 300K for 8%?

41:22.280 --> 41:24.248
No.

41:24.248 --> 41:28.553
I'll do 300K for 10%,
final offer.

41:28.553 --> 41:33.491
♪♪

41:33.491 --> 41:36.027
Okay. Done.
Whoo!

41:38.830 --> 41:41.199
Herjavec: Wow!
You've got a deal.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.000
Well done, girls.
You killed it.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.569
Grede: I love it.
I cannot wait.
Thank you so much.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.337
This is going to be so good.
You're a queen.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.905
Herjavec: You guys are amazing.
Good luck, guys.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.274
Yay!
Thank you so much!

41:50.274 --> 41:52.477
Okay, bye.
Bye.

41:52.477 --> 41:55.279
Oh, my God.
I can't digest that.

41:55.279 --> 41:57.348
What the [bleep]
just happened?

41:57.348 --> 42:00.785
Sarai: Emma is setting
the trends in the industry.

42:00.785 --> 42:03.354
And I think our company
is a perfect complement

42:03.354 --> 42:05.089
to some of the other things
she's working on,

42:05.089 --> 42:07.291
and she is going to help us
blow this out of the water.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.660
I didn't think that plane
was going to land for a while.

42:09.660 --> 42:10.828
I knew it was.

42:10.828 --> 42:12.764
If there was anybody
who was ever a perfect fit

42:12.764 --> 42:13.965
for a business,
you're the perfect --
Greiner: You were
the perfect partner.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.933
I feel like
I'm fitting perfectly.
Yeah.

42:15.933 --> 42:18.169
I'm a boob solution queen.
Yeah.

42:18.169 --> 42:19.804
What's incredible, though,
is Kevin thinks

42:19.804 --> 42:21.539
he's the perfect fit
for
every
business.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.907
That's right. I am.
