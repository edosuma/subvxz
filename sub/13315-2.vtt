<i>to death valley ever.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.413
Woman:
So we get together
and do it together.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.382
- Which is -- awesome.
- I'm down.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.150
You know what I mean?

00:18.152 --> 00:20.686
As fast as I could down
the freeway, splitting lanes.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.621
Whoo!

00:24.057 --> 00:25.290
Whoo-hoo!

00:25.292 --> 00:27.793
These are not
as comfortable on my balls.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.162
Man:
<i>Come on!</i>

00:30.164 --> 00:31.630
- Smell the gas.
- Light it.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.768
You have dunes there
that look like mars.

00:35.770 --> 00:38.404
Welcome to the desert,
boys.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.739
Man: <i>Aah!</i>

01:00.827 --> 01:03.162
Reedus:
<i>Las vegas.</i>

01:03.164 --> 01:06.598
<i>Now, this is a place</i>
<i>where you can really get lost.</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:09.568
People come here for the escape
<i>and the thrill.</i>

01:09.570 --> 01:12.538
<i>"fight for love" playing</i>

01:12.540 --> 01:16.542
<i>This place is an adrenaline</i>
<i>rush waiting to happen.</i>

01:16.544 --> 01:20.412

01:38.299 --> 01:40.799
<i>"buy the ticket,</i>
<i>take the ride."</i>

01:44.337 --> 01:46.438
<i>All in all,</i>
<i>I'm a pretty lucky guy.</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:48.574
<i>I've traveled</i>
<i>all over the world--</i>

01:48.576 --> 01:51.844
<i>La, new york,</i>
<i>london, tokyo.</i>

01:51.846 --> 01:54.146
<i>I've gotten to call each one</i>
<i>of these places home.</i>

01:54.148 --> 01:55.848
<i>There's something about</i>
<i>the bright lights</i>

01:55.850 --> 01:58.851
<i>And the hum of the city</i>
<i>that's engrained in who I am.</i>

01:58.853 --> 02:02.754
<i>I've never made it out</i>
<i>to the desert.</i>

02:02.756 --> 02:04.790
<i>My friend balthazar getty</i>
<i>has been taking his bike</i>

02:04.792 --> 02:07.726
<i>Out to death valley</i>
<i>every chance he gets.</i>

02:07.728 --> 02:09.394
<i>It's one</i>
<i>of his favorite places</i>

02:09.396 --> 02:11.196
<i>And he's been dying</i>
<i>to get me there.</i>

02:11.198 --> 02:12.731
So when he hit me up suggesting
<i>we jump on our bikes</i>

02:12.733 --> 02:15.501
<i>And take a ride out,</i>
<i>I texted him right back.</i>

02:15.503 --> 02:17.302
<i>"hell yeah."</i>

02:19.205 --> 02:20.672
<i>Starting out in vegas,</i>

02:20.674 --> 02:24.409
<i>We'll head 125 miles west</i>
<i>on us 160,</i>

02:24.411 --> 02:25.644
<i>Through the mountains</i>
<i>and valleys</i>

02:25.646 --> 02:28.147
<i>Across state lines</i>
<i>into california,</i>

02:28.149 --> 02:31.283
<i>Deep into the heart</i>
<i>of death valley.</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:32.651
<i>But before we head out,</i>

02:32.653 --> 02:35.187
<i>We're spending</i>
<i>24 hours in vegas.</i>

02:35.189 --> 02:37.389
<i>We got ourselves</i>
<i>a pair of ducatis,</i>

02:37.391 --> 02:38.690
<i>And we're meeting up</i>

02:38.692 --> 02:41.160
<i>Old-school spots</i>
<i>on the strip.</i>

02:57.911 --> 02:59.611
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.181
- How are you, dude?
- All right, buddy.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.849
- I love you, man.
- Norm.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.318
All right.
This place is cool.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.354
Yeah, this is the classic
peppermill restaurant.

03:09.356 --> 03:12.791
This diner was in "casino"
and "showgirls."

03:12.793 --> 03:13.926
Yeah, it's pretty epic.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.327
If you notice,
there's, like,

03:15.329 --> 03:18.430
A little theme
going on here.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.466
Um...

03:21.468 --> 03:23.936
Both:
Short skirts.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.338
Reedus:
<i>Balthazar and I go way back,</i>

03:26.340 --> 03:28.373
<i>To my early days</i>
<i>living in la.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:30.909
<i>We met through friends</i>
<i>and instantly hit it off.</i>

03:30.911 --> 03:32.611
<i>And, yes, he's a getty.</i>

03:32.613 --> 03:34.746
<i>His great-grandfather,</i>
<i>j. Paul getty,</i>

03:34.748 --> 03:36.648
<i>Was the richest man</i>

03:36.650 --> 03:39.551
<i>In charge of one of</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:41.753
<i>Balt is one of the hardest</i>

03:41.755 --> 03:44.356
<i>Music producer, dj,</i>

<i>"lost highway,"</i>
<i>"lord of the flies,"</i>

03:45.993 --> 03:47.626

<i>And I couldn't imagine</i>

03:52.733 --> 03:55.467
<i>Doing this ride</i>
<i>with anyone else.</i>

03:55.469 --> 03:57.603
I mean, I've known
you for how long?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.738
Like, a long-ass time.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.641
I think longer than we really
probably wanna say.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.510
probably. Yeah.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.379
Um, I don't even think
you were acting

04:07.381 --> 04:10.015
At the time when we met.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.416
No, I was working
at a motorcycle shop,

04:11.418 --> 04:13.418
And I was just
doing artwork around la.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.787
Well, I had
a little loner bike
from a harley spot.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.390
It was a honda rebel.
It was, like, a little
honda rebel.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.658
The rebel.
I remember the rebel.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.026
Yeah,
you remember that?

04:21.028 --> 04:23.262
I used to ride that thing
from downtown la

04:23.264 --> 04:26.298
All the way to venice
as fast as I could.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.799
Like, doesn't matter
if it was pouring rain.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.302
Down the freeway,
splitting lanes on
that little bike,

04:30.304 --> 04:31.436
Just 'cause I didn't
wanna lose that job.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.671
Oh, really?

04:32.673 --> 04:33.939
That bike weighed,
like, 60 pounds.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.941
It was the tiniest
little thing.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.743
Have you been
to death valley?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.645
I've never been
to death valley ever.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.281
- I shot "lost highway" there...
- Oh, no --?

04:42.283 --> 04:44.283
...With lynch,
and that's, like,

04:44.285 --> 04:46.685
Where my whole love affair
with death valley--

04:46.687 --> 04:47.819
And I hear it's really
cold at night.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.421
Yeah, yeah, it is.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.323
I've never done it
out here before, so...

04:51.325 --> 04:52.624
Yeah, no, no,
it's really cold.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.759
Tell me some stuff
about death valley.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.727
You know,
death valley, I mean,

04:55.729 --> 04:59.331
You have rock formations
that look like you're on mars,
you know?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.868
I noticed--
so there's something
spiritually about deserts

05:02.870 --> 05:05.704
That are--
they're very introspective,

05:05.706 --> 05:08.607
And so, like,
you find yourself, you know?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.575
And I can remember growing up,

05:10.577 --> 05:14.446
Going out to joshua tree
and-- and--

05:14.448 --> 05:16.581
And going and expanding
our minds.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.885
Yeah, I don't wanna
do any of that.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.887
- So tonight in vegas...
- Tonight in vegas.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.689
...And then we hit the road?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.525
So we have some
friends of mine that
are meeting up tomorrow.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.959
These girls, they're great.
You'll love 'em.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.661
- Who's that?
- They're super cool.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.996
You'll meet 'em.
I'm not even gonna tell you.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.364
I'm just gonna, like,
surprise you.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.665
Oh, really?
A little surprise?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.000
A little surprise, yeah.
They're awesome.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.868
And then, uh,
we'll hit the desert.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.570
- Deal?
- I like it.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.604
Cheers. Love you.

05:39.606 --> 05:40.706
You, too, buddy.
Proud of you.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.973
Yeah.

really nice being on

Is that a juice place?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.770
It's an animal reserve.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.671

Great work they're
doing there.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.508

of the empire state building,

07:51.505 --> 07:54.005
And they took a portrait
of me at the tippy-top.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.007
I thought I was
gonna -- die.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.744

the wind was blowing
my hair sideways,

What makes one
of these bikes your bikes?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.318
I mean, you have such
a unique style, you know?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.887
I never plan out as far
as what we're doing.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.222
Starting with the motor,

09:17.224 --> 09:19.124
And then everything
kind of grows, you know,

09:19.126 --> 09:20.892
<i>Organic-looking, I guess.</i>

09:20.894 --> 09:22.694
And people, they commission
you to do a bike for them,

09:22.696 --> 09:23.828
They just kind of go,
"do your thing"?

09:23.830 --> 09:25.230
Yeah, exactly.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.966
Yeah, so, like, all this stuff
is entirely handmade.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.968
The gas tank started
from a flat piece.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.871
All this started
from raw materials.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.339
You know, a gas cap
and everything.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.207
You do kinda get, like,

09:36.209 --> 09:39.110
All these, like, natural,
organic lines and movement.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.979
It almost looks
like insects.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.213
Yeah, I guess it could.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.949
Right?
Parts of insects
go together.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.083
You know, looks, like,
alien.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.718
Just gotta sit on it, man.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.154
- Can I?
- Yeah.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.855
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.991
This--
it feels so solid, too.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.328
Yeah, yeah.
It's balanced pretty well.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.362
Wow.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.698
So you pound out each piece?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.132
Yeah, I'll show you guys.
Let me show you guys
how it goes.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.367
Most of my machinery
is really old.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.835
<i>Like this power hammer.</i>

10:03.837 --> 10:05.103
Basically, all this
thing does is--

10:05.105 --> 10:06.204
It's like
you swinging a hammer,

10:06.206 --> 10:08.039
Just harder and faster.

10:08.041 --> 10:12.611
It's real loud, too.
I'll give you guys
some of these.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.279
What?

10:14.281 --> 10:16.281
Can't hear
-- in these. Wow.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.716
Yeah,
it's gonna be loud.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.285
Does this ever split off
and cut a finger?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.620
It hasn't happened so far.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.988
- Yeah, well...
- Until now.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.623
Until reedus
gets his hands on it.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.625
- Don't even say that.
- I'll run it with you.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.360
We'll be like patrick swayze
and demi moore in...

10:28.362 --> 10:30.161
Yeah, like, "ghost."

10:30.163 --> 10:32.063
<i>who's who? Who's who?</i>

10:32.065 --> 10:33.932
He liked that.
He liked that one.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.834
I'm funny. I got jokes.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.135
You gotta be demi,
though.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.137
Yeah, I'm totally--
-- kidding me?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.039
When I'm working it,

10:41.041 --> 10:43.008
I always pull
my thumbs in like this
just a little bit.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.409
- Your thumbs in.
- Why?

10:44.411 --> 10:47.245
So it doesn't get caught
on the machine.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.980
I just met you.
You seem like a nice guy.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.215
Like, you're gonna chop
my thumbs off.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.650
I'm helping you out
right now.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.385
Just feel the pedal.
Don't smash on it.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.787
Just ease into it.

10:55.789 --> 11:00.825
- Thumbs like this?
- Yeah, yeah. You got it.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.961
That was perfect right there.
That's what you wanna do.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.166
Yeah,
that was a good one.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.136
Reminds me
of my ex-girlfriend.
You know what I'm saying?

11:13.939 --> 11:15.273
Yeah.
Yeah, that's pretty good.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.808
Not bad, right?
It's kinda smooth.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.678
Doing all right.

Cheetah's the strip club?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.776
Yeah.
I used to cook for the girls
and all the employees.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.545
That's gotta be a good sign.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.346
<i>I've been mastering</i>
<i>these formulas</i>

18:02.348 --> 18:04.215
Using the girls for about
five years, so...

18:04.217 --> 18:06.484
Using the girls
at cheetah's for five years.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.819
It sounds--
it sounds wrong.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.420
I'm getting
all my money back, man.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.691
I'll get on that
pulled pork for you.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.660
<i>- Should we go in the saloon?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

18:15.662 --> 18:18.429
<i>Yeah, just wait</i>
<i>for lead feather.</i>

18:20.699 --> 18:23.201
- This is cool.
- This is awesome.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.270
Reedus:
<i>Oh. What? Look at this.</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

18:27.406 --> 18:28.873
Getty:
<i>This is the goods right here.</i>

18:28.875 --> 18:30.608
Reedus:
<i>Let's play poker or whatever.</i>

18:30.610 --> 18:33.211
<i>Here. I got a dollar.</i>

18:33.213 --> 18:35.113
Big money, big money,
big money, big money.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.547
Big money,
big money, big money.

18:36.549 --> 18:39.383
Okay. I'm blackjacking.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.751
Oh, my god. Look at this.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.522
Oh. Winner, winner,
chicken dinner. Right there.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.591
Winner again.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.359
Dude, I've already
doubled my money.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.861
Killing it right now.

18:49.863 --> 18:52.130
I just went-- I just hit,
like, three blackjacks.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.266
I'm, like,
a master at this thing.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.701
Just tripled
my money already.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.202
How do I get my money back?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.437
You guys,
I'll pay for your food.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.805
You can have my winnings.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.307
- Cash out.
- Thank you.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.609
You're my new favorite guy.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.144
<i>You know</i>
<i>what I'm saying?</i>

19:06.146 --> 19:08.779
My daughter wants to give
you her phone number.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.414
Oh,
I see how it works.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.717
I buy you food, and you
pass on your daughter.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.252
I see how it works
over here.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.387
Can you put my winnings
on their thingy?

19:16.389 --> 19:17.922
Cool. Thanks, guys.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.557
Let's go eat some barbecue.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.293
Let's go. Come on.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.262
- Yeah!
- Ah, perfect timing, guys.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.696
Oh, is this us
right here?

19:25.698 --> 19:26.831
Yeah, have a seat
anywhere you like.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.399
Dude, this is awesome.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.869
This is-- I call it my dirty
pulled pork sandwich.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.304
Wow.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.872
This looks delicious.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.207
And some fries.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.708
All right.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.678
<i>I say it's the best bargain</i>
<i>in all of nevada.</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:44.815
Mm. Mm. Mm.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.584
Dude, try this.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.452
What's your secret recipe?

19:48.454 --> 19:51.289
There's about
24 different ingredients
in the barbecue sauce.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.392
<i>It's not too sweet.</i>
<i>It's not too spicy.</i>

19:54.394 --> 19:56.894
<i>And make it to where</i>
<i>everybody can eat it.</i>

19:58.197 --> 19:59.530
Take that thing down, man.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.400
Take that thing down.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.568
I feel like a wild animal,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.703
And I just caught it
and ate it myself.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.238
This was so good.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.240
I'm gonna sell this
to somebody on the crew

20:09.242 --> 20:11.209
- For a lot of money.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.410
Thank you
for having us, man.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.477
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>not a problem, guys.</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:15.346
And feeding us.
Cool spot here.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.414
Pleasure to meet you.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.715
Yeah, enjoy your rides.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.849
And you with your cool name.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.351
Lead feather?
Don't forget it.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.852
And norman,
which is totally boring.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.255
Dude,
that sandwich, honestly,

20:24.257 --> 20:26.357
Might be
the best barbecue ever.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.358
That was ridiculous.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.926
Hey, eat this. I'm serious.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.728
It's -- delicious.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.964
It's crazy good.

Norman, nice to meet you.
Jimmy.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.770

You're gonna give us

Let's get started.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.755
What I got for you guys
to ride today

22:04.757 --> 22:05.990
Is a couple yamaha wrs.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.793
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.794
Electric start.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.630
This is based
off a motocross bike,

22:12.632 --> 22:14.765
And they kinda
tune it so that it works
better off-road,

22:14.767 --> 22:16.467
So it's just
super easy to ride.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.436
They're at the top
of the performance level.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.944
These are not
as comfortable on my balls

22:26.946 --> 22:28.612
As that other one.

22:28.614 --> 22:30.348
We're gonna go shut 'em off
real quick.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.516
Uh, the red button.
Yeah, the red one.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.552
- We have a winner.
- It's not easy.

22:34.554 --> 22:35.886
I'm already sweating.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.421
Wanna gear up and start
goofing around?

22:37.423 --> 22:38.723
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

22:38.725 --> 22:40.624
- Are these brand-new?
- <i>Brand-new.</i>

22:40.626 --> 22:41.826
Uh-oh.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.602
<i>You like peacocks?</i>

22:51.604 --> 22:53.104
- Like what?
- <i>Peacocks.</i>

22:53.106 --> 22:54.939
I don't know. To eat?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.974
No, that's our
school mascot, yeah.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.376
Wait,
you have a pet peacock?

22:58.378 --> 23:00.044
It's pecker.
It's a she.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.512
She likes everybody
but me.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.981
- Pecker.
- Let's do it.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.654
- Everybody's good?
- Yeah.

23:10.656 --> 23:12.056
Okay, let's go
hit the trails, huh?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.725
Let's do it, man.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.598
Whoo!

23:23.403 --> 23:26.437
<i>It's like the world's</i>
<i>biggest flat track.</i>

23:26.439 --> 23:28.072
<i>And the other cool thing is,</i>
<i>there's no rules.</i>

23:32.912 --> 23:34.412
Yeah!

23:34.414 --> 23:35.679
Ah, this is dope.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.848

Wheelie.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.896
Whoo!

23:53.532 --> 23:54.732
I just wanna go wheelie.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.067
Okay, so I'll give you
a quick little demo.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.970
You wanna stay in
the stationary position.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.972
- Uh, see.
- It's hard not
to move forward.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.041
Yeah.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.209
Show you
what I'm talking about.

24:05.211 --> 24:08.579
No, hop on.
Hop on.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.780
Feet on the foot pegs.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.750
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.719
- Doing it, right?
- Yeah.

24:15.721 --> 24:18.155
Okay, don't lean back.
Just stay with me.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.938
I don't think that's
in your liability contract.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.073
Well, hi. How are ya?

24:36.075 --> 24:38.742
Oh, uh,
I gotta separate my knee

24:38.744 --> 24:40.544
From this pad for a second.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.879
You getting
a knee-pad rubbin'?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.147
I got knee chafe.

24:44.883 --> 24:49.620
I just gotta drop my pants
for two seconds here.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.921
Hey, look.
Your bike wheelies.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.190
Oh, yeah.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.959
<i>Is that what you do</i>

- Yo.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.038

all the way to the end.
Here.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.574
Balty, get over here.
Let's play.

25:10.576 --> 25:13.043
I'll outrun both
of you bitches right now.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.280
Hit it.

25:38.603 --> 25:41.138
Reedus:
Yeah!

25:41.140 --> 25:43.607
Aah!

25:43.609 --> 25:44.909
I can't take
all this open road.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.544
This is too much.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.713

26:06.299 --> 26:09.567
<i>Night falling all around you</i>

<i>This is the zen</i>

<i>We've traded the dirt bikes</i>
<i>for our ducatis,</i>

<i>And as the sun dips</i>
<i>below the horizon,</i>

<i>We're gonna ride off</i>
<i>into the complete darkness</i>

26:48.674 --> 26:50.074
<i>When the sun comes up.</i>

26:50.076 --> 26:54.211
Today was epic.
I feel incredibly sore,
though.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.213
I feel very old right now.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.616
You looked like
you were 12 years old.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.650
I felt like I was 12.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.118
You were just like, "whee!"

27:01.120 --> 27:04.755
Honestly, like, having
that much room around you,

27:04.757 --> 27:08.258
It kind of felt like
you came out of a cage.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.393
You know what I mean?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.161
Like,
you just discovered

27:11.163 --> 27:13.397
Space and freedom
for the first time.

27:13.399 --> 27:16.000
- It was amazing.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.684
<i>She introduced me</i>
<i>to her bike collective</i>

27:33.686 --> 27:34.985
<i>Babes ride out.</i>

27:34.987 --> 27:37.187
<i>Anya violet</i>
<i>and ashmore ellis</i>

27:37.189 --> 27:39.056
<i>Are the cofounders</i>
<i>of babes ride out,</i>

27:39.058 --> 27:42.059
<i>A badass, women-only group</i>
<i>of motorcycle enthusiasts</i>

27:42.061 --> 27:43.861
<i>Who share a love</i>
<i>of the open road</i>

27:43.863 --> 27:46.296
<i>And one golden rule--</i>
<i>no 'tude, no dudes.</i>

27:46.298 --> 27:47.931
Tell me about
the babes ride out.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.067
Like, that's kinda
how I know nina, and--

27:50.069 --> 27:51.368
Ellis: <i>All started,</i>
<i>like-- was just a simple</i>
<i>text message</i>

27:51.370 --> 27:53.070
<i>Between anya and I.</i>

27:53.072 --> 27:54.905
And we're like,
"we should go ride together."

27:54.907 --> 27:56.306
And then it turned into,
"no, let's actually

27:56.308 --> 27:58.709
Really go camp together
and open up to other girls,"

27:58.711 --> 28:01.879
'cause we rode,
but we haven't met anyone
else that did, women.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.213
We just wanted to meet
more women that rode
motorcycles.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.282
I mean,
it's, like, somewhat rare.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.918
Ellis:
<i>Once we put it on instagram,</i>
<i>it kinda went viral.</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:10.354
50 women on motorcycles
from all over?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.289
- <i>In 2013. </i>
<i>- Like, girls rode</i>
<i>  from portland.</i>

28:12.291 --> 28:15.292
Like,
girls shipped their bikes
out from new york.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.128
Those 50 girls are what
brought 500 girls,

28:18.130 --> 28:22.066
And those 500 girls
are what brought 1,200 girls
to this last event.

28:22.068 --> 28:24.301
This year, we're doing
babes east coast.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.370
We're going to new york
and doing the catskills,

28:26.372 --> 28:27.971
And then we're having
our first uk event as well.

28:27.973 --> 28:29.206
Which is -- awesome.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.741
But you're also
open to, like,

28:30.743 --> 28:32.176
Girls who are just
getting into motorcycles, too.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.377
Absolutely.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.712
'cause I know girls
that are, like,

28:34.714 --> 28:35.879
"oh, my god,
I wanna learn."

28:35.881 --> 28:37.414
But you guys are,
like, open--

28:37.416 --> 28:39.983
I think
that's a beautiful thing
that you do that.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.819
This is about
riding motorcycles,

28:41.821 --> 28:43.120
Camping,
and having fun with--

28:43.122 --> 28:44.855
And meeting new friends,
so--

28:44.857 --> 28:45.989
What are we doing tomorrow?

28:45.991 --> 28:47.891
The artist, uh...

28:47.893 --> 28:50.461
Artist drive
and dante's view.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.462
Have you guys--
have you been here before?

28:51.464 --> 28:53.130
I've never been here.

28:53.132 --> 28:56.266
It seems to attract a certain
type of person, you know?

28:56.268 --> 28:58.268
- For sure.
- Yeah.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.104
Yeah, there's your hippies,

29:00.106 --> 29:02.840
There's artists,
there's people that just

29:02.842 --> 29:05.109
Don't wanna be
around people.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.744
<i>- They're the best.</i>
<i>- So it's like, you know--</i>

29:06.746 --> 29:09.413
Which will be me
before not too long, yeah.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.981
Ellis:
<i>This is norman's house</i>
<i>down the road.</i>

29:10.983 --> 29:12.249
Yeah, I'll be out here.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.851
What bikes
you guys on tomorrow?

29:13.853 --> 29:16.453
We look ridiculous.
We have matching bikes.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.255
Oh, my god. So cute.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.891
- <i>That's adorable. </i>
<i>- We're adorable.</i>

29:20.893 --> 29:22.326
So we look pretty lame,
but those bikes--

29:22.328 --> 29:24.161
We look awesome.
What are you talking about?

29:24.163 --> 29:25.496
Violet:
What are you talking about?
You look amazing.

29:25.498 --> 29:28.365
You got these badass
chicks in leather

29:28.367 --> 29:30.300
On, like,
you know, choppers.

29:30.302 --> 29:33.303
I like it. And I'm down.
You know what I mean?

29:33.305 --> 29:35.272
- <i>You wanna trade? </i>
<i>- Cheers.</i>

29:35.274 --> 29:36.440
Thank you, guys,
for doing this, by the way.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.541
Yeah,
thanks for having us.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.842
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Cheers.</i>

29:38.844 --> 29:40.077
Thank you for coming.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.345
Kaplan:
Are you serious?
Yeah.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.147
Ellis:
<i>Thanks for having us.</i>

29:48.420 --> 29:51.388
<i>Reedus:</i>
<i>I just popped my desert cherry.</i>

29:51.390 --> 29:53.357

- So good.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.426

Oh, look, dude.
Horseshoes.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.163
Are you kidding me?
Yes.

29:59.165 --> 30:02.800
This is the best
place ever.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.034
Okay, ready?
At the same time.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.203
One, two, three.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.172
<i>Oh, come on. Come on.</i>
<i>Ah.</i>

30:08.174 --> 30:10.574
Almost.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.075
You throw three or one?

30:12.077 --> 30:14.077
I think you just--
I'm not sure, actually.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.915
- Does it go like this?
- Yeah.

30:17.917 --> 30:21.485
Interference.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.921
- Yeah, that sucked.
- <i>Try one more.</i>

30:23.923 --> 30:25.389

30:25.391 --> 30:26.824

30:26.826 --> 30:28.826
Yeah. Oh!

30:33.231 --> 30:35.065
No. Ah.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.600
These games are harder
than they look.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.402
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.245
Reedus:
<i>I'm beginning to realize</i>

30:48.247 --> 30:50.380
<i>That death valley</i>
<i>gets a bad rap.</i>

30:52.317 --> 30:55.519
<i>Most people assume</i>
<i>it's this barren desert,</i>

30:55.521 --> 30:58.889
<i>But waking up here,</i>
<i>it doesn't take long</i>

30:58.891 --> 31:02.459
<i>To realize that nothing could</i>
<i>be further from the truth.</i>

31:07.967 --> 31:09.900
- Wow, look
how pretty this is.
- I know.

31:09.902 --> 31:13.136
- How goes it?
- This is crazy pretty
right here.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.973
- I know, right?
- Beautiful place to ride
motorcycles, right?

31:15.975 --> 31:17.341
Kind of not a bad day
for it either.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.309
How are you?

31:19.311 --> 31:20.944
Exciting.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.346
Good morning. How are ya?

31:22.348 --> 31:23.480
How you doing?

31:23.482 --> 31:25.949
So you gals,
you both slept.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.150
- Yeah.
- You didn't sleep.

31:27.152 --> 31:28.552
Yep, I'm a zombie.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.520
So we'll have to wake you up
on the ride, right?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.155
Yeah, we'll wake up
on the ride.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.490
Little wind in your face.
You'll be good.

31:33.492 --> 31:34.558
Smell the gas.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.026
Yeah,
that'll wake you up.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.928

artist, uh...

31:37.930 --> 31:39.429
-  <i>Artist's drive. </i>
<i>- That's right. Artist's drive.</i>

31:39.431 --> 31:41.665
It's a good route, too,
out that way.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.467
See what you guys
are riding here.

31:43.469 --> 31:47.204

Yeah, different minerals.

35:07.773 --> 35:11.641
It's so weird to think
that this is, like, 100
feet below sea level.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.277
- That trips me out.
- Reedus: It trips me
out, too.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.780

it's too barren and it's
not, you know,

- Solitude.

36:02.694 --> 36:07.831

like natural mount rushmore.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.167
<i>This is sort of like you can</i>
<i>just finally take a breath.</i>

36:10.169 --> 36:13.603
Yeah, it's so nice
to be away from everything.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.205
Like, basically away
from civilization.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.307
I think it gives you
a sense of, like, scope.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.509
Like your size versus
the rest of the world.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.278
That's one of the coolest
things, though.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.581
When we want to escape la
or southern california,

36:24.583 --> 36:26.917
We just can ride out
to joshua tree

36:26.919 --> 36:28.451
Or anywhere and just
get away from everybody.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.853
How often
do you guys do that?

36:29.855 --> 36:32.589
Just go, "call me.
Let's go do something.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.691
- Let's go ride."
every weekend?
- <i>Pretty much every weekend.</i>

36:34.693 --> 36:38.395
Bad day at work,
get on the bike, go in
the mountains, done.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.571
Reedus:
<i>All my life, I've been</i>
<i>drawn to big cities.</i>

36:47.573 --> 36:50.207
<i>I thrive on the chaos</i>
<i>of the streets</i>

36:50.209 --> 36:53.476
<i>And the solitude of being</i>
<i>the one person lost in</i>
<i>the crowd of millions.</i>

36:53.478 --> 36:55.912
<i>But being here,</i>

36:55.914 --> 36:58.348
<i>Man, it's a different</i>
<i>kind of solitude.</i>

36:58.350 --> 37:00.550
<i>It's absolute</i>
<i>and crushing.</i>

37:00.552 --> 37:02.586
<i>There's no outside</i>
<i>stimulus.</i>

37:02.588 --> 37:04.454
<i>No distractions.</i>

37:04.456 --> 37:07.224
<i>And it's just you</i>
<i>and your thoughts.</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:09.826
<i>Already, I know why</i>
<i>balt wanted to take</i>
<i>me out here.</i>

37:18.703 --> 37:21.838
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, wow.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.306
<i>Ah!</i>

37:45.529 --> 37:47.597
Reedus:
<i>As the day burns on</i>
<i>in death valley,</i>

37:47.599 --> 37:49.432
<i>We're on</i>
<i>a 5,000-foot ascent</i>

37:49.434 --> 37:51.368
<i>Through the black mountains</i>
<i>to dante's view.</i>

37:58.442 --> 38:00.410
We're going
into a canyon.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.583
Whoo! It's like
a roller coaster.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.387
Reedus:
<i>With a name like</i>
<i>dante's view,</i>

38:10.389 --> 38:12.989
<i>You know the views</i>
<i>are going to be insane.</i>

38:12.991 --> 38:16.593
<i>We're going to be overlooking</i>
<i>one of the lowest points</i>
<i>in north america.</i>

38:16.595 --> 38:20.664
<i>A salt flat basin</i>
<i>282 feet below sea level.</i>

38:22.366 --> 38:24.934
<i>I can't wait to finally</i>
<i>experience it myself.</i>

38:27.705 --> 38:30.307
Oh, my god!

38:30.309 --> 38:32.575
- Getty: <i>Wow. </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Oh, wow.</i>

38:32.577 --> 38:36.046
Violet:
<i>Oh, my god,</i>
<i>that's so cool.</i>

38:36.048 --> 38:37.981
This is awesome.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.784
Oh, my god.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.987
<i>I'm tripping out.</i>
<i>This is amazing.</i>

38:43.989 --> 38:47.357
- Reedus: <i>This is awesome. </i>
<i>- Holy crap.</i>

38:47.359 --> 38:49.526
- It's all good.
- Look at it!

38:49.528 --> 38:51.027
Whoo!

38:51.029 --> 38:53.997
Reedus:
<i>Whoa, yeah,</i>
<i>this is crazy.</i>

38:53.999 --> 38:55.999
Violet:
<i>It looks like a painting</i>
<i>or something.</i>

38:56.001 --> 38:57.767
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at that little--

38:57.769 --> 38:59.369
- It looks like--
- crater thing?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.538
Yeah, like a meteor
or something maybe hit.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.074
Ellis:
<i>And it looks like there's</i>
<i>water down in that corner.</i>

39:04.076 --> 39:06.743
- <i>Do you see that? </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>It does look</i>
<i>like a sinkhole.</i>

39:06.745 --> 39:10.113
- Look at that.
- Getty: Is that water?

39:10.115 --> 39:13.683
We've got to get a photo
of all of us with that
in the background.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.719
- Get in here, girls.
- Come here. Come here.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.921
- Come here.
Come here. Come here.
- Get on the farm.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.923
Don't anybody
step backwards.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.094
yeah.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.865
This is probably
the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.101
- It's crazy.
- This is definitely

39:31.103 --> 39:33.503
- The prettiest
thing I've ever seen.
- The mountains are blue.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.673
- The most beautiful
desert I've ever seen.
- Yeah.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.007
Reedus:
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

39:38.009 --> 39:40.377
It's just like
full-on no-man's-land.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.446
So from zombie burlesque

39:43.448 --> 39:47.050
To top of the mountain
in death valley.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.486
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Pretty wild.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.488
I've never ridden in
the desert ever.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.056
- Really?
This is your first time?
- First time, yeah.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.392
This is a good
place to start.

39:55.394 --> 39:58.027
This is one of the probably
most unique places in
the entire world.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.096
<i>Do you see why we do</i>
<i>babes ride out in the desert?</i>

40:00.098 --> 40:03.133
Hell, yeah.
I mean, on the instagram
and stuff, I end up

40:03.135 --> 40:05.902
Following a lot of people
that ride in places
that look like this.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.738
Just because I'm in new york
going, "that must be cool."

40:08.740 --> 40:10.940
- You know what I mean?
- I'd rather be there today.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.943
Yeah, than live
vicariously through strangers
who ride through those.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.446
- I do that all the time.
- Yeah, this is beautiful
out here.

40:16.448 --> 40:20.083
- I get it, you know?
- Yeah, I'm glad we could be
your first time in the desert.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.885
This pops
my desert cherry.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.787
you're welcome.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.922
- You're welcome.
- This is so good.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.692
Wait, I feel like the girls
are sort of taking credit

40:29.694 --> 40:32.028
For the desert thing,
but really--

40:32.030 --> 40:33.897
- I mean, I kind of--
- this was your idea.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.800
thank you so much
for doing this.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.951
Let's roll.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.619
Let's go hang out
by a campfire.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.455
- I like it.
- Yeah, let's do that.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.089
- Okay.
- Let's build a campfire.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.993
Yeah.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.995
Awesome.
Let's do it.

41:12.570 --> 41:13.636
Getty:
It starts to get chilly.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.538
Reedus:
Yeah, I feel it.

41:15.540 --> 41:17.507
Violet:
Yeah, in the shade,
it's a little chilly.

41:17.509 --> 41:20.677
Getty:
I think I'm gonna put
my hand warmers on, honey.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.979
Reedus:
Oh, that's a good idea,
sweetheart.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.914
Oh, so jealous.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.149
Bastards.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.984
Should I put it on
medium or high?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.986
I think I'm gonna
go for a medium

41:29.988 --> 41:31.621
'cause they really
get warm.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.923
- The hands get too warm.
- Violet: <i>Stop!</i>

41:41.966 --> 41:44.501
I feel like I'm walking
on a giant powdered donut.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.503
like a sponge or something.

41:46.505 --> 41:49.072
- That's what I'm talking about.
- It's like a crust of snow.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.174
- This weird martian...
- Papier-mâché.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.676
- Papier-mâché.
- It's crazy.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.712
- Look at that.
- That is the jam
right there.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.047
- That's the jam right there.
- Who brought the shrooms?

41:58.049 --> 42:00.517
- <i>That is exactly-- </i>
<i>-</i> <i>seriously.</i>

42:00.519 --> 42:02.719
- Light it.
- There you go.

42:04.656 --> 42:06.689
All right, guys,
a toast.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.191
Yes, a toast.

42:08.193 --> 42:11.528
- Today was amazing, guys.
- Yeah, today was good.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.663
Awesome riding.
Awesome scenery.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.665
- Awesome company.
- Cheers to new friends.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.734
- To death valley.
- Absolutely to death valley.

42:17.736 --> 42:21.671
<i>Has been one</i>
<i>of the most incredible</i>
<i>trips I've ever taken.</i>

42:21.673 --> 42:23.773
<i>Balthazar was right</i>
<i>and I'm grateful</i>

42:23.775 --> 42:25.942
<i>He brought me and the babes</i>
<i>ride out crew out here.</i>

42:25.944 --> 42:27.844
<i>Riding through the desert</i>
<i>is not something</i>

42:27.846 --> 42:29.178
<i>I'm going to forget</i>
<i>any time soon.</i>

42:29.180 --> 42:31.047
<i>You might come here</i>
<i>to escape,</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:33.216
<i>But you end up discovering</i>
<i>something about yourself.</i>

42:33.218 --> 42:36.953
<i>And this ride has surpassed</i>
<i>all my expectations.</i>

42:36.955 --> 42:39.756
<i>The incredible scale</i>
<i>of this magnificent landscape</i>

42:39.758 --> 42:42.659
<i>Makes you realize</i>
<i>that this planet we call home</i>

42:42.661 --> 42:45.128
<i>Really is massive</i>
<i>and we're just travelers</i>

42:45.130 --> 42:47.730
<i>Who are fortunate enough</i>
<i>to be passing through.</i>

42:48.732 --> 42:50.934
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>That's okay with me.</i>

42:52.303 --> 42:54.304
<i>I'm always down for a ride.</i>
