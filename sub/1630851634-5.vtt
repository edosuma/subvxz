WEBVTT

00:18.476 --> 00:19.644
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:20.729 --> 00:22.105
[Love] I have a plan.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.025
[reporter] Mrs. Engler was involved
in an extramarital relationship

00:26.109 --> 00:27.318
with Gil Brigham.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.071
In a written letter, Mr. Brigham confessed

00:30.155 --> 00:32.323
that he murdered Mrs. Engler
and disposed of her remains.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.533
Find the people that get you.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.161
-How do you know who those people are?
-You just do.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457
[Joe] I can't be thinking
about you like this. No.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.167
You okay there, Joe?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.961
[Joe] Oh, no. This is bad.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.717
We've really turned a corner.
We barely fight anymore.

00:51.384 --> 00:55.722
And when we disagree,
we discuss it directly, then we move on.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.098
Guess you could say we're just

00:57.182 --> 00:59.893
-a normal, boring suburban family.
-Whoo!

00:59.976 --> 01:01.144
[Joe] She said boring. Not me.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.395
Everything's fine.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.439
[Joe] Sure, little bit of a yawn.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.985
Oh, it's been six months.

01:09.986 --> 01:14.783
-And we don't know how to say this.
-[Joe] Come on, Love. Spit it out.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.409
Do we need to keep coming?

01:17.368 --> 01:20.205
I know we're already down
to every other week,

01:20.288 --> 01:22.791
but we rarely have anything
to talk about with you.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.125
[Joe] Or with each other.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.418
Is this financial?

01:25.502 --> 01:29.589
We talked about your mom buying
the vineyard and you feeling strapped.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.300
-No, business is good.
-Love is being modest.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.719
The bakery is a huge success.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.640
I can't believe I'm so happy here.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.434
[Joe] I'd never call Love a pod person,

01:41.518 --> 01:43.978
but let's just say she's assimilated.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.482
-Joe? How have you been?
-[Joe] Oh, I'm fine.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.276
Bored, trapped in Pleasantville,
aging so fast,

01:50.360 --> 01:52.654
I forget to jack off in the shower.

01:52.737 --> 01:53.571
I'm good.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.532
Work is good.

01:56.282 --> 02:00.995
-Uh, I've really gotten into lawn care.
-Oh, my God.

02:01.079 --> 02:05.708
-He is obsessed with the lawn.
-The lawn is the foyer to the home.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.588
[Joe]
My love of our glorious foyer is genuine.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.677
After Gil, I realized there's a price
to pay if you want a stable life.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.470
And I am happy

02:17.554 --> 02:22.684
to forego excitement and chaos for that,
to be the husband and father I want to be.

02:23.518 --> 02:27.897
I can do it, for Henry. I'm great at it.
Lawn mowers are very fun.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.317
Joe's been having
a harder time making friends here.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.527
[Joe] Excuse me?

02:33.778 --> 02:36.656
I have plenty of friends.
I do, at the library.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.827
-Any friends you don't work with?
-[Joe] Well, no.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.620
Everyone else is an asshole.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.497
Let me tell you what Love is not saying.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.126
Not having friends puts
a lot of pressure on a partner.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.671
-Do you feel pressure, Love?
-Yes.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.589
[Joe] She does?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.633
One person cannot fulfill all our needs.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.095
It's crucial to have friends
outside a marriage.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.347
It takes some of that pressure off.

03:01.431 --> 03:05.476
[Joe] I don't see great candidates
for BFF here in Madre Linda, but...

03:05.560 --> 03:06.394
Okay.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.480
I will try harder.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.692
I'm annoyed, but promises are easy
when your priorities are clear.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.028
Make our marriage work.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.780
So our time's almost up, but I should ask.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.241
How's your sex life been?

03:20.325 --> 03:21.701
-It's good.
-It's great.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.871
It's great. I should have said great.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.250
[Love moaning]

03:31.210 --> 03:32.253
Wait.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.130
Ah. Not again.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.381
Hold on, I just--

03:35.465 --> 03:37.926
-I need a sec.
-Hey, it's fine. It's fine.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.096
I'm tired anyway.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.195
Remember what we used to say? I wolf you.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.200
Yeah.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.536
We should bring that back.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.789
[Joe]
We also never rip each other's clothes off

04:07.872 --> 04:09.540
and fuck like wildcats anymore.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.417
We've been domesticated.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.503
-I'm sorry about--
-No, it's fine.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.633
I wolf you.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.969
[chuckles]

04:24.222 --> 04:27.100
[Joe] Wolf? We're dog-on-a-leash now.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.310
This is fine. It's normal.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.270
It's fine.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.564
And if it feels like it's not,
maybe I'm the problem.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.784
[Joe] Maybe you and Dr. Chandra are right.

04:44.867 --> 04:48.371
My introvert tendencies are
the reason I feel off.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.916
Joe, mm, can you tilt your chin forward?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.836
[Joe] But did you have
to make Sherry your best friend?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.045
Oh, my God.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.674
The camera is loving Henry's authenticity.

04:59.757 --> 05:04.846
Um-- Guys, are we sure
puppies is the right theme for the party?

05:04.929 --> 05:07.390
I'm not usually indecisive. It's just--

05:07.473 --> 05:09.309
Sherry keeps saying that...

05:09.392 --> 05:12.395
[Joe] Parties indicate your child
and family are socially adjusted

05:12.478 --> 05:15.148
and an integral part of the community.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.776
And a critical part
of getting into The Ashman School,

05:18.860 --> 05:21.738
Madre Linda's premiere private Pre-K.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.781
-Shoot me.
-We're doing everything right.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.367
Joe, no one wants
to go to a birthday party

05:26.451 --> 05:29.412
where Daddy looks
like a Cymbalta commercial, okay?

05:29.495 --> 05:32.248
So, Love, let's get
some singles over here,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.000
and, Joe, just shake it off.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.294
Just shake it off.

05:36.961 --> 05:37.795
Come on.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.382
[Joe] Something about fitting
into suburbia has changed you, Love.

05:41.466 --> 05:45.094
You went from being horrified
by the ostentatiousness of a kids party

05:45.178 --> 05:47.638
-to Keeping Up With The Conrads.
-[Sherry] The other side.

05:47.722 --> 05:52.393
[Joe] And yet, you make belonging look
so effortless.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
-You do seem happy.
-[Sherry] No Cymbalta here.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.023
[Joe] Why do I still feel
so on the outside?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.692
Joe, come over here, sweetie.
The vibe is much better.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.153
[pop music playing over speakers]

06:03.029 --> 06:05.281
-Wow.
-Oh, yeah.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.825
I think Theo's visiting home.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.243
Theo.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.299
Yes! Yes!

06:23.382 --> 06:24.467
Finally!

06:24.550 --> 06:27.970
We got it.
These invitations are gonna be adorable.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.555
Yeah.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.560
-Thank you so much, Sherry. Really.
-Yeah.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.854
Joe, I like it when you appreciate me.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.900
[Marienne] Oh, my gosh.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.902
If you could see his hair.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.031
Mari, do me the favor of describing.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.074
Oh, my.

06:48.157 --> 06:48.991
Okay.

06:49.492 --> 06:55.331
Whole vibe's very
Patrick-Bateman-meets-Venetian-gondolier.

06:55.414 --> 06:59.585
Oh, okay. Right. Let me just go fix it.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.296
Oh, no, no. No. Wait, wait.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.425
Dante, cover the floor?

07:07.885 --> 07:09.178
Okay, here's one.

07:09.804 --> 07:14.392
Favorite classic fantasy series.
Let's say 1970s through '90s?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.520
Okay. Give me a minute.

07:17.603 --> 07:21.566
Yes, I notice Marienne in that way,
but I cut it off instantly.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.276
I'm married, so she and I are friends.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.778
Am I supposed to feel bad
that I'm friends with people at work?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.239
Dragonriders of Pern, maybe.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.157
Okay.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.369
But, you know, as a kid, I hid them.
I was afraid they were for girls.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.957
Why? It's dragons fighting space worms.
That is not gender-specific.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.711
-Trying to fit in is the worst.
-[Joe] Exactly.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.298
-How is this helping your portrait?
-Who said I was doing a portrait?

07:46.048 --> 07:48.134
Well, I mean, I guess, sort of.

07:48.217 --> 07:51.304
I had been working on this sketch
of the Little Prince and the Fox.

07:51.387 --> 07:55.600
Couldn't get the Fox,
and your vibe today inspired me.

07:55.683 --> 07:59.770
It's for this illustration contest
put on by this fancy imprint,

07:59.854 --> 08:03.191
and this year, it's reinterpret
a classic of children's lit.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.944
"It's the time you lavished on your rose

08:07.862 --> 08:11.240
that makes your rose so important."

08:11.949 --> 08:12.825
Hmm.

08:14.410 --> 08:20.583
Um, anyway, I probably won't
even submit, so...

08:20.666 --> 08:25.505
You have a habit of talking yourself out
of things. Is this something you do often?

08:25.588 --> 08:29.008
All right, Sigmund Freud,
sit back and sit still, please.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.595
I thought this wasn't a portrait.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.850
-So why The Little Prince?
-Just always loved it.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.436
Translations never do it justice,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.606
but the original will always be
my favorite.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.732
Do you speak French?

08:45.399 --> 08:46.609
[speaking French]

08:47.443 --> 08:51.572
-My first language. I was born in Paris.
-You don't have an accent.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.408
You wanna be friends
with people who can surprise you.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.244
I moved when I was young,

08:56.327 --> 09:00.998
and it's really just
not that interesting a story, so...

09:01.082 --> 09:02.208
[Joe] Maybe to her.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.960
Why so wary?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.420
So scared to be seen.

09:07.964 --> 09:12.385
That's what I want in friends,
to be inspired to wonder.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.302
[Marienne] Joe?

09:13.761 --> 09:15.263
-[Joe] Who is she?
-Show me.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.057
Your drawing.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.157
It's going to be beautiful.

09:36.450 --> 09:40.079
-Thank you.
-Marienne, you have to submit this.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.424
No, no, no.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.802
Did I learn nothing from Natalie?
Why am I holding this?

09:54.885 --> 09:56.971
Put the bracelet down.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.058
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.023
I mean, you look paler than usual,
and that's saying something.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.608
No, everything's fine.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.527
Okay.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.530
[Joe] Shit. Feeling drawn
to Marienne is just a symptom.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.577
The problem is me, running away from
my perfectly good life and devoted wife.

10:20.244 --> 10:24.957
So, if I'm the problem, how do I fix it?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.255
Smells good, bro.

10:33.466 --> 10:38.179
But the key to truly orgasmic BBQ
is catching the meat yourself.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.555
Yeah, you mentioned.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.556
Six times.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
But it's okay because look at you.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.603
Happy wife, happy life, right?

10:46.228 --> 10:48.022
What could say more about my commitment

10:48.105 --> 10:51.025
than agreeing to dinner
with the fucking Conrads?

10:51.108 --> 10:53.653
If putting up with Cro-Magnon man gets
the tips you need

10:53.736 --> 10:58.783
to make Henry's party a success,
I'm all in because I am all in, damn it.

10:58.866 --> 10:59.867
[Sherry and Love laughing]

10:59.950 --> 11:03.871
-Are you sure you don't want a top off?
-Ugh. It won't kill me.

11:03.954 --> 11:04.997
[Love chuckles]

11:06.290 --> 11:07.208
Ugh.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.502
That one.

11:12.046 --> 11:17.802
I heard he's on probation at school
for showing up to a midterm drunk.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.928
-Oh.
-Thanks.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.055
Imagine what his grades look like.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.474
Actually, I thought he was doing okay.

11:23.557 --> 11:26.602
That one's determined to self-destruct.

11:26.685 --> 11:30.439
He got arrested in high school, two DUIs.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.692
Just a matter of time before he starts
cooking meth like Jessica Sherman,

11:33.776 --> 11:35.486
winds up dead in a ditch.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.071
Mm.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.158
I mean, he seems like a good kid
in a tough situation,

11:42.535 --> 11:45.413
-but I know you know him better than I do.
-No.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.706
No, you're right.

11:48.290 --> 11:53.087
-He just needs some better influences.
-Yeah.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.381
[Cary] Pretty capable in the kitchen,
Miss Quinn-Goldberg.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.217
Next time we'll be hunting
the pigs ourselves.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.552
Is that right?

11:59.635 --> 12:01.262
That'd be my husband.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.097
Better watch out, Joe.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.183
Cary's gonna wind up dragging you
on his hunting trip tomorrow,

12:06.267 --> 12:07.685
make you a better man.

12:07.768 --> 12:10.146
[Cary] Actually, there's a spot
with your name all over it.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.772
It's just what you need, my friend,

12:11.856 --> 12:14.275
to recharge those masculine batteries,
if you know what I mean.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.652
-[Joe] I do not.
-We hike. We hunt.

12:16.735 --> 12:20.948
We don't have to restrain
our, uh, natural impulses.

12:21.031 --> 12:22.324
It's an incredible feeling,

12:22.408 --> 12:25.077
letting out that part of yourself
that you have to cage.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.414
[Joe] Unleashing my impulses
is the opposite of what I need to do.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.541
No, thank you. Hard pass.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.669
It sounds great, but I do think
that we have Henry's party...

12:33.752 --> 12:36.255
No, no, no. It sounds great.
You should totally go.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.632
Sherry and my mom can help
with party prep.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.552
Be great for you
to get to know the guys better.

12:41.635 --> 12:43.554
-[doorbell rings]
-[Joe] Saved by the bell.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.017
[Cary] We're almost to the day.
My brother's September 2nd.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.020
-Theo.
-Hi.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.022
You look nice.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.359
-What are--? What are you...?
-Oh, I, um...

12:57.443 --> 13:01.280
It's street cleaning tomorrow,
so thought I'd give you a heads-up.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.075
Car's in the driveway.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.412
Yeah, but to warn you
not to put them on the street.

13:11.916 --> 13:12.917
Okay.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.003
-Okay, wait. Wait, wait, Theo.
-Yeah.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.215
Are--? Are you okay?

13:21.634 --> 13:22.468
Yep.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.512
Never better.

13:25.179 --> 13:28.098
Really? Because I heard that--

13:28.974 --> 13:29.975
Hey.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.562
Why do I feel like I walked
into the middle of something?

13:36.190 --> 13:39.568
Oh, by the way,
the lawn, it looks impeccable.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.947
Richard Yates-level attention to detail.

13:43.697 --> 13:44.907
[Joe] He's read Yates?

13:47.701 --> 13:49.787
-He's weirder than ever, huh?
-He's not weird.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.207
He's a kid. Kids are weird.
Cut him some slack, okay?

13:55.709 --> 13:58.254
[Joe] Why are you acting so--? No, no, no.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.299
Stop looking for trouble.
You are fine. I am the problem.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.012
So why do I feel
like you're hiding something?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.349
Dr. Chandra would say
I'm falling into old patterns. No.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.685
I'm committed
to being a good husband and father.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.853
That involves things like lawn care

14:14.937 --> 14:18.148
and making sure there are
no fraudulent charges from hotels

14:18.232 --> 14:21.402
where you're conducting an affair
with the stepson of the woman you killed.

14:21.485 --> 14:25.239
Yeah, I know how crazy I sound...
Love! What the fuck?

14:25.781 --> 14:28.784
One, two...
Twelve Uber charges in Palo Alto?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.620
Are ride-shares
the seedy motels of NorCal?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.958
How the fuck did I miss this?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.502
Hey. He's down.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.049
What? Something wrong?

14:46.135 --> 14:49.138
Do you know about
these Uber charges in Palo Alto?

14:51.765 --> 14:53.350
Are you asking me or accusing me?

14:53.934 --> 14:57.521
I'm calling the credit card company
to cancel. I just wanted to make sure.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.358
Sometimes Theo texts me when he's drunk
and I get him an Uber.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.152
What?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.654
Nobody looks out for him, Joe.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.616
And with Matthew,
it's good to keep a line open.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.497
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.084
Love?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.797
-Okay, he kissed me.
-He kissed you?

15:23.881 --> 15:28.510
Yeah. It was before he left for school.
I mean, obviously, I shut it down.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.429
-That's shutting it down?
-Don't yell.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.057
-You've been sneaking around.
-That's crazy.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.976
You made me feel
like something's wrong with me.

15:36.060 --> 15:40.064
And I've done everything you asked.
You've been lying to me this whole time!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.613
What the fuck was that, Joe?

15:48.906 --> 15:51.116
You are clearly not happy.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.621
I hope this weekend helps you get
your shit together. Something has to.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.710
[dramatic music playing]

16:05.214 --> 16:08.384
[Joe] Being with men
in the woods is not my thing,

16:08.968 --> 16:13.305
but I couldn't say no to you
after what I did, so here I am.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.017
You can go on ahead without me if you...

16:18.227 --> 16:20.604
Nah, no man left behind.

16:21.772 --> 16:26.110
Cary and I made that pact at 'Manjaro.
He carried me up the Barranco Wall.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.239
Kilimanjaro. What an amazing--
How much longer to the campsite?

16:30.322 --> 16:33.075
Nothing bonds you like the altitude shits.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.244
[Joe] Why is male small talk so terrible?

16:35.327 --> 16:37.705
'Manjaro was such an eye-opener.
When I got back,

16:37.788 --> 16:39.790
Kiki and I started unschooling the kids.

16:40.958 --> 16:41.792
Unschooling?

16:42.292 --> 16:45.295
It advocates for child-chosen activities

16:45.379 --> 16:47.548
instead of textbook-based learning.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.008
Books can be the worst.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.426
Mind-confiners, right?

16:50.926 --> 16:54.221
Cary's the expert, even though
Sherry's all in on The Ashman School.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.890
I respect how they make it work.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.435
Can I tell you something?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.313
Cary saved my marriage.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.319
I made all this money in my 20s.
Didn't have to work, so I stayed home.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.407
I loved being the kids' unteacher.
But, also, I was...

17:14.950 --> 17:17.119
I just didn't feel like a man.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.079
I was angry all the time.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.291
I came here broken.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.295
Cary helped me embrace my inner beast.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.924
To grunt and breathe and scream and...

17:33.093 --> 17:34.011
And cry.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.305
To let go.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.683
[Joe] All's fine and well for this guy,
his inner beast's a Persian kitten.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.727
Letting go is scary.

17:42.895 --> 17:47.566
It's something about these woods,
with these men, that makes it feel safe.

17:48.108 --> 17:51.612
I'm excited for you.
Your life's about to change.

17:51.695 --> 17:55.199
[Joe] How coddled was his life
to believe he's safe among men?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.827
I wasn't even safe among boys.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.037
[boys chattering]

18:01.080 --> 18:03.957
[Derek] You like that shit, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

18:04.041 --> 18:07.711
Oh, this is so fun. This is so fun.

18:07.795 --> 18:11.840
You're gonna cry for your mommy too, huh?
Just like your buddy Joe!

18:12.508 --> 18:13.467
[Brandon] You okay?

18:17.429 --> 18:21.350
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I'm in worse shape than I thought.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.651
...if you hadn't been snacking
the whole time...

18:30.734 --> 18:31.610
You know what?

18:35.823 --> 18:38.158
Welcome to the Promised Land!

18:38.909 --> 18:41.662
-You went all out.
-His minions went all out.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.955
Got here hours ago.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.666
It started off as a hike
and ended as a run.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.794
Way too much energy. Yes!

18:48.877 --> 18:50.212
Claim your digs.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.132
Then we'll gather more wood.
I'm glad you're here, boys.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.591
Let's go.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.554
Faith over fear. It's time to check out,
so we can check in.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.432
Let's hydrate! We're gonna do
some sweating, boys.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.188
Mm-mm.

19:08.605 --> 19:12.693
Rule number two. Only food we eat
is what we kill ourselves.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.947
We'll go over the rules at dusk.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.824
[Joe] What is this,
Fight Club in the redwoods?

19:18.907 --> 19:20.742
-I haven't eaten all day.
-Yeah.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.328
Let me tell you a story.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.792
One time I got caught in a 'lanche,
split-boarding at 'Hoe.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.795
In the snow two hours
before they rescued me.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.006
Most suffocate in five minutes.

19:34.756 --> 19:38.218
If I can survive that,
pretty sure you can survive this.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.806
Let me translate.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.394
Cary got stuck in an avalanche in Tahoe.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.355
Must we abbreviate everything? Confusing.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.400
Who's got the arms to gather fuel with me?

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
I'm on it.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.988
Chop-chop. Let's run.

20:00.532 --> 20:04.453
Yeah! Let's do this!
Fire is life, boys. Fire is life.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.456
-You actually like these trips?
-I like that Andrew likes them.

20:08.415 --> 20:12.502
No, in all honesty, they really have been
a savior for our marriage.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.339
I'm sorry.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.299
How?

20:17.382 --> 20:19.092
We come undone.

20:19.843 --> 20:23.096
The first time I came out here,
I wept like a baby.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.268
All it took was trying to make fire.
Some make it farther before they break.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.437
Why would anyone wanna get to that point?

20:31.563 --> 20:34.524
Your kid hasn't reached the terrible twos

20:34.608 --> 20:37.277
or my personal favorite,
the fucking fours,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.112
but he still has tantrums?

20:39.196 --> 20:41.740
Henry's an overachiever in that area.

20:41.823 --> 20:46.912
So don't you ever wanna scream
and cry and break shit?

20:47.996 --> 20:51.708
Cary says this trip's about being a man.
I think it's about being a kid again.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.626
Hmm.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.254
Here.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.840
You can have a meaningful experience
while maintaining

20:58.924 --> 21:01.051
a normal blood-sugar level.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.471
Thank you.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.101
[bells chiming]

21:13.230 --> 21:16.692
Hello. Welcome. What can I get you?

21:16.775 --> 21:19.403
Uh, yeah, can I get one of everything?

21:20.654 --> 21:23.365
Oh. I forgot my wallet again.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.449
Ugh.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.076
Well...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.330
That's all right.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.459
On the house. Study fuel.

21:35.002 --> 21:35.919
Mm.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.506
I'm actually taking some time off.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385
To process the whole Natalie thing.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.471
You could have told me
you were struggling.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.351
No, I couldn't 'cause you drew a line.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.187
-No more e-mails, only Ubers.
-Right.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.689
Thank you.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.607
But, um...

21:59.609 --> 22:01.611
I am worried about you.

22:03.238 --> 22:04.072
Are you?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.327
'Cause I've been worried about you.

22:08.410 --> 22:13.582
I... I heard your husband yelling at you
the other night,

22:13.665 --> 22:16.043
and I know that we are, like...

22:17.377 --> 22:20.297
Whatever,
but if you need someone to talk to--

22:20.380 --> 22:22.716
-Yeah, I have friends for that.
-Right.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.052
Sherry Conrad.

22:25.135 --> 22:29.181
-We have more in common than you think.
-You're both human women.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.265
Totally.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.976
Come on, she's, like, an inch deep.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.439
You're only friends
because she's the only option in town.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.316
It's not a crime to fit in, Theo.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.903
Maybe you'll understand that
when you're older.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.572
You've changed.

22:47.365 --> 22:48.909
That's not always a bad thing.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.704
Enjoy the muffins. Okay?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.253
[bells chiming]

23:05.926 --> 23:07.636
[Cary making animal call]

23:17.395 --> 23:19.564
I learned this mating call
outside of Cartagena.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.985
Three minutes later, a doe popped out
of the brush, started nuzzling my cock.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.695
[Joe] Will it ever stop?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.656
All right, let's go. Circle up!

23:29.116 --> 23:30.200
Rules!

23:30.867 --> 23:34.788
One, we already know, make our own fire.
Well done, my brothers.

23:34.871 --> 23:35.705
Whoo!

23:35.789 --> 23:38.583
Two, we only eat what we kill.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.709
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:39.793 --> 23:43.839
Three, issue with a fellow hunter?
You fight it out.

23:43.922 --> 23:44.756
[grunts]

23:44.840 --> 23:48.635
Four, no phones, no shirts. No exceptions.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.679
Other than that,

23:51.263 --> 23:53.098
no rules!

23:53.181 --> 23:54.808
-Yeah!
-Grunt!

23:54.891 --> 23:56.226
-[all grunting]
-Scream!

23:56.309 --> 23:59.646
-[all screaming]
-Embrace your inner beasts!

23:59.729 --> 24:01.022
[all shouting]

24:02.399 --> 24:04.442
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

24:04.526 --> 24:05.944
Yes!

24:06.570 --> 24:10.949
Come on! Let's go, Goldberg!
I'm gonna get you dirty tonight, boy.

24:12.159 --> 24:12.993
[Joe] Shit.

24:16.746 --> 24:21.626
Love, you had your tribe in L.A.
You even found one here.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.171
[all screaming]

24:25.422 --> 24:29.301
But if this is my pack,
I think I'm meant to be a lone wolf.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.802
You ready to feel like a high-speed,

24:30.886 --> 24:33.805
low-drag apex motherfucking predator
out there?

24:38.476 --> 24:39.311
Shit.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.107
Thattaboy.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.734
Now listen to that drum.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.194
Huh?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.571
How does it make you feel?

24:49.654 --> 24:50.655
[Joe] Appropriative.

24:51.156 --> 24:56.578
You've been disconnected for so long
that your manhood is literally shrinking.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.373
Love told Sherry about your dick issues.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.541
[Joe] You told her?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.126
Come on.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.836
Feel that.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.631
You feel alive right now, don't you?

25:09.007 --> 25:10.425
And you want more.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.844
Tell me I'm wrong.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.137
[Joe] He's wrong.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.222
It's fine.

25:15.889 --> 25:16.848
I do, yeah.

25:19.976 --> 25:24.105
You're my charge tonight, Joe.
I'm not letting you leave my side.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.073
Now we hunt.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.743
I can't believe they said no presents.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.746
At least I won't be paying
for his therapy.

25:39.829 --> 25:40.830
[cell phone buzzing]

25:41.873 --> 25:42.958
Got any more wine?

25:50.924 --> 25:51.800
Hello?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.427
Theo, I can't talk.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.347
You're where?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.891
[Cary] Keep up the pace, Goldberg.

26:01.768 --> 26:05.063
I didn't give you permission to stop.
Beasts don't stop.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.356
[ominous music playing]

26:07.691 --> 26:08.692
Faster.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.282
-Wait. Hang on. I need a second.
-Boo-hoo. Get up.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.743
-I need a minute.
-There are no time-outs in life.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.037
On your feet.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.457
Jesus Christ.
Does your penis have mounds on it?

26:24.541 --> 26:28.044
[Joe] No. I am not that guy,
as much as Cary deserves it.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.337
-[branches rustling]
-Quiet.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.172
-You hear that?
-What?

26:34.467 --> 26:36.636
Oh, what the fuck now?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.222
Wait here.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.933
[Joe] Things aren't gonna work out
between me and Cary.

26:42.017 --> 26:45.186
I'd say now is my chance to escape.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.772
But if he doesn't come back, I'll starve,

26:47.856 --> 26:50.358
or be eaten by whatever I'm hunting.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.277
This is what I get for being a pacifist.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.196
Woo-hoo!

26:55.280 --> 26:57.741
-[Joe] Uh... No.
-Take it.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.284
-Take the squirrel.
-No.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.994
-Kill it.
-No, no, no.

27:01.077 --> 27:04.956
Are you okay with your life as it is?
If you wanna get your dick up again--

27:05.040 --> 27:08.293
-I don't see how the two are related.
-[yelling] It's about being a man!

27:08.376 --> 27:10.628
Let go of the squirrel. You're hurting it.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.546
[squirrel chittering]

27:13.590 --> 27:15.008
[bones crack]

27:17.218 --> 27:20.013
[in normal voice]
Yeah. You think I'm a bully?

27:21.056 --> 27:21.890
Fine.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.225
You know the rules.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.145
"You got a problem with a fellow hunter,

27:28.063 --> 27:29.522
you fight it out."

27:32.901 --> 27:35.653
Come on, Joe.
I'm gonna need you to hit me.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.114
[Derek]
No one is coming to save you, you pussy.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.867
I'm not playing this scene
from this movie.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.371
[yelling]
Come on, bro! Clock me, motherfucker!

27:44.454 --> 27:45.997
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

27:47.957 --> 27:49.417
Fucking hit me!

27:50.794 --> 27:51.753
Now!

27:56.007 --> 27:58.218
-[Cary screaming]
-[thuds]

28:06.476 --> 28:07.727
[Joe] Oh, shit.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.608
[boys chattering]

28:28.665 --> 28:32.252
[Derek] No one is coming to save you.
What you gonna do, Goldberg?

28:32.335 --> 28:33.336
Don't!

28:49.310 --> 28:51.521
-Help. Help.
-What happened?

28:52.147 --> 28:53.732
-Cary...
-He fell.

28:53.815 --> 28:54.649
[Jackson] Is he okay?

28:54.733 --> 28:55.775
-He fell.
-Shit.

28:55.859 --> 28:56.985
Hey! No phones.

28:57.068 --> 28:59.112
Are you serious? This is an emergency.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.281
-He's not breathing.
-Shit, there's no signal.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.575
-He's dead.
-We don't know that.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.119
What's going on? Oh, God.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.371
We don't know that. He might not be.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.416
Come on. Come on.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.418
-Come on!
-What are we gonna do?

29:13.501 --> 29:15.086
Come on, wake up.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.254
Wake up.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.673
What are you doing, Goldberg?

29:22.051 --> 29:23.094
You saving me?

29:24.804 --> 29:26.473
I'm fucking moved, man.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.642
-Oh, my God. You're alive.
-Of course I'm alive.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.688
Been taking glutathione for a decade.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.773
[groans]

29:36.566 --> 29:37.942
I'm impossible to kill.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.030
-[shoulder cracks]
-[groans]

29:42.113 --> 29:43.072
Ooh.

29:54.542 --> 29:55.835
And this fucking guy...

29:55.919 --> 29:58.213
[Joe] He's gonna tell them
I threw him off a fucking cliff,

29:58.296 --> 30:02.008
that I'm crazy, whatever
the opposite is of "part of the tribe."

30:02.967 --> 30:05.053
Goldberg is a fucking animal.

30:06.971 --> 30:07.931
Come here.

30:19.776 --> 30:24.072
You are one fine specimen of a man, Joe.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.582
[breathing heavily]

30:38.503 --> 30:39.379
Let it out.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.466
[sobbing]

30:46.010 --> 30:49.472
[Jackson] Yes, Joe. Let it out.
Good man. That's it. You got this.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.391
[Brandon]
You got this. This is your 'Manjaro.

30:51.474 --> 30:53.351
-[Jackson] There he is.
-[Andrew] You're good.

30:53.434 --> 30:54.978
Welcome to the other side.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.193
[Andrew] You got this. Yeah!

31:02.277 --> 31:05.697
[Joe] I came to the woods,
afraid of the darkness inside me,

31:05.780 --> 31:08.199
but they saw it

31:08.283 --> 31:10.243
and accepted me anyway.

31:10.326 --> 31:13.413
Is this what it feels like
to have friends?

31:13.496 --> 31:16.416
Fitting in is not always the worst.

31:16.499 --> 31:20.503
Yes, they're silly. Yes, what happens
out here is fucking nuts.

31:20.587 --> 31:21.921
All I know...

31:22.755 --> 31:25.508
is I feel like me again.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.322
-I didn't think it would take so long.
-You could have killed yourself.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.324
-Or someone else.
-That might be stretching it.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.785
-You don't know that!
-I was driving a scooter.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.289
An electric scooter.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.668
Ah.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.172
They arrested you
for driving drunk on a scooter?

32:04.255 --> 32:05.089
Yeah.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.641
You ever been on one?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.185
[Love laughing]

32:17.268 --> 32:18.853
-[Theo] All right. Ready?
-Yeah.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.563
-Ready for the hill?
-Yeah.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.773
We're charging the hill.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.024
[both shouting]

32:25.068 --> 32:28.613
Let's go!

32:31.449 --> 32:32.617
Oh, fuck.

32:36.913 --> 32:40.291
-Ow.
-See? It's not that easy.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.376
Is it?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.504
I can't believe
I've never done that before.

32:44.587 --> 32:48.424
Well, you know, it is a perfectly
socially-acceptable way

32:48.508 --> 32:50.885
for adults to get around now, FYI.

32:57.517 --> 32:58.476
Um...

33:01.771 --> 33:03.731
So the rumors about...

33:05.525 --> 33:09.112
me taking a leave of absence
because of Natalie...

33:10.029 --> 33:11.030
Um...

33:12.907 --> 33:13.992
They're not true.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.369
I...

33:18.538 --> 33:20.164
I'm flunking out because...

33:22.250 --> 33:24.419
I can't stop thinking about you.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.889
If you want me to shut up, I will.
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.559
I'm just trying to figure out...

33:42.270 --> 33:45.690
how I can focus when all I want is you.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.650
Theo, shut up.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.610
No.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.988
It's like you're playing house.

33:53.072 --> 33:55.575
But none of this actually makes you happy.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.910
I'm playing house?

33:59.370 --> 34:02.790
You're a teenager chasing
after a married woman.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.584
What's your endgame?

34:12.467 --> 34:14.135
[dramatic music playing]

34:31.944 --> 34:33.279
[cell phone buzzing]

34:41.954 --> 34:44.749
Did you go to the bakery
for that frosting tip or Alaska?

34:45.708 --> 34:48.294
I got distracted
with the sourdough starter.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.838
I saw that boy get out of your car.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.424
What are you doing?

34:55.134 --> 34:57.470
It's nothing. I'm just helping him out.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.307
You missed Henry's first steps.

35:02.892 --> 35:03.726
What?

35:03.810 --> 35:06.646
You might have seen
if you'd picked up when I FaceTimed you.

35:07.688 --> 35:09.690
Oh, he's down for the night now.

35:11.859 --> 35:14.028
Love, Love,

35:14.654 --> 35:16.656
all parents make mistakes.

35:16.739 --> 35:17.865
God knows I did.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.909
I missed my son's first steps.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.702
It was anticlimactic.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.288
I don't even think
I really remember yours.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.249
What the fuck am I even doing?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.418
I mean, I'm happy here.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.797
-Everything's fine if Joe would just be--
-Blame Joe all you want.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.633
The truth is, you preferred him
when he was a problem to fix.

35:35.716 --> 35:37.093
You like someone to save.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.011
It's the dynamic you had
with your brother.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.763
So let me be blunt. Grow up.

35:42.181 --> 35:44.600
That boy will distract you from your son.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.146
I know you love Henry,
but that doesn't mean you won't harm him.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.986
Here, have some of my cab sauv.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.489
Much healthier addiction than a teen boy.

36:00.116 --> 36:03.911
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my crush Rachel Maddow is waiting.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.333
[cell phone chimes]

36:44.202 --> 36:46.120
This is very impressive.

36:46.704 --> 36:50.166
Hey. Hi. Wow, you made it home on time.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.793
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.128
I'm...

36:54.212 --> 36:56.756
I think
Henry's a little young for hunting.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.549
These are gifts from Cary.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.218
They're for us. His and hers.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.344
Huh.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.596
Wow.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.474
Hey.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.851
Hi, hi.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.692
-Hey, you smell bad.
-Yeah, I know, it's awful.

37:17.693 --> 37:20.571
I'm gonna shower,
but first, I need to apologize.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.241
-No. Joe--
-I have been working so hard

37:23.324 --> 37:25.618
to keep myself in line,

37:26.953 --> 37:29.872
I forgot there are healthy ways
to let things out.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.708
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about--

37:32.792 --> 37:35.211
You don't need to tell me everything.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.296
I trust you.

37:39.715 --> 37:43.803
-Wow. That was some weekend you had.
-Yeah. Really, it was.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.263
[doorbell rings]

37:45.346 --> 37:46.806
Fuck, okay, okay.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.725
-People are here. Get a shower real quick.
-Yeah.

37:49.809 --> 37:50.643
Okay.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.237
-[Love] Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.450
[Joe] I can't remember a time
when I didn't long for someone

38:06.534 --> 38:08.619
who totally accepted me.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.664
The bad with the good.

38:13.916 --> 38:18.379
Why is it that a person who can do that
always comes at a cost?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.469
Your friend Paulie's doing better.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.389
Thought you might wanna know.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.354
If you'd given it back to that bully,
I wouldn't have told on you.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.607
It's what he deserves.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.736
-I chickened out, I guess.
-Yeah.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.531
'Cause you're not like him.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.369
I know what it feels like
to get picked on.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.665
I'm sorry, it's not fair.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.756
We'll look out for each other.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.175
Deal?

39:05.843 --> 39:06.677
Deal.

39:13.559 --> 39:17.063
[Joe] You were right, Love.
This party wasn't just about him.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.523
We did it. We kept him safe.

39:19.607 --> 39:24.278
Doesn't mean he'll happy all the time,
it just means we're here for him,

39:24.362 --> 39:25.488
no matter what.

39:25.571 --> 39:27.031
[both moaning]

39:32.787 --> 39:34.080
Oh, my God.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.332
Oh, my God.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.834
You're an animal.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.716
I think we're gonna have to get...

39:46.801 --> 39:47.968
somebody to...

39:48.969 --> 39:51.722
soundproof the bedroom.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.933
-I think I know a guy.
-Mm-hm.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.477
[cell phone beeping]

39:58.187 --> 39:59.021
What?

39:59.605 --> 40:01.148
-Fuck.
-What is it?

40:01.232 --> 40:05.444
Fuck. The bakery. The alarm's been off
for, like, four hours.

40:05.528 --> 40:06.654
It's probably okay.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.533
-What if someone--?
-Look, I'm sure the sensor's

40:10.616 --> 40:13.577
-just on the fritz, but I'll go. I got it.
-Yeah?

40:14.412 --> 40:15.371
I really got it.

40:15.454 --> 40:18.582
And by that,
I'm afraid what I really mean...

40:18.666 --> 40:22.086
is that I used primitive tools
to carve out the time and space I need

40:22.169 --> 40:24.797
to go on a certain kind of hunt.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.972
I'll admit, this is all a bit elaborate.
And this ploy will only fool you once.

40:33.639 --> 40:37.226
But after what happened with Natalie,
you can't blame me for covering my tracks.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.856
[Theo] Oh, fuck.

40:43.023 --> 40:44.233
Oh, my God.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.860
[Theo moaning]

41:00.249 --> 41:01.959
Oh, fuck.

41:02.042 --> 41:05.045
[Joe] Cary actually taught me
an important lesson, Love.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.256
I can't completely cage
what's inside of me

41:07.339 --> 41:10.384
or, when it bursts out,
it comes for blood.

[screams]

41:11.385 --> 41:14.513
Better to feed it just enough
to keep it in check,

41:14.597 --> 41:17.391
keep it on a leash, take it out for walks,

41:17.475 --> 41:19.810
but make sure it knows the rules.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.854
No keepsakes.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.105
Are you okay?

41:23.189 --> 41:26.484
No social media, just watching.

41:28.068 --> 41:32.114
So now I have you, Marienne.

41:32.615 --> 41:36.202
Arms always full of books.
Never leaving the library before dark.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.912
No one to hurry home to.

41:39.538 --> 41:40.873
We're just friends.

41:40.956 --> 41:43.709
So, what is it about you?

41:44.627 --> 41:46.253
I can't pin it down.

41:46.337 --> 41:51.759
All I know is that I've felt more alive
these past few days watching you

41:51.842 --> 41:54.970
than I have in a long, long time,
Marienne.

41:55.554 --> 41:59.850
But... you can trust me
with this secret, Love.

42:00.559 --> 42:04.813
Juggling the two of you is confusing,
I'll admit.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.566
But I'm up for the challenge.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.068
You won't find out.

42:09.151 --> 42:10.611
You can't.

42:10.694 --> 42:13.322
I'll be careful. So, so careful.

42:13.405 --> 42:16.033
Things will be different this time.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.705
