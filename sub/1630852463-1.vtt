00:01.375 --> 00:04.125
(inspiring music)

00:38.292 --> 00:40.500
[Female] 30 seconds.

00:40.792 --> 00:41.792
20 seconds.

00:44.167 --> 00:45.167
10 seconds.

00:48.083 --> 00:49.375
(beeping)

00:49.667 --> 00:50.947
We have in the studio tonight,

00:51.125 --> 00:52.625
Mr. Emmanuel Whitbread,

00:52.917 --> 00:55.042
Britain's leading transplant surgeon

00:55.333 --> 00:56.792
who's here to tell us something

00:57.083 --> 00:59.625
of his own particular
field of miracle medicine.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.125
Mr. Whitbread, when can we expect

01:03.417 --> 01:04.542
the first brain transplant?

01:06.208 --> 01:08.417
Oh, I don't know
anything about the brain.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.875
I've been working on the other extremity.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.208
[Interviewer] The feet?

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
The p(bleep).

01:14.208 --> 01:16.417
Oh, you mean the male organ?

01:16.708 --> 01:18.542
One usually does mean the male organ

01:18.833 --> 01:20.333
when one refers to the (bleep)

01:20.625 --> 01:21.825
As opposed to the female organ

01:21.958 --> 01:23.625
which is known as the (bleep).

01:23.917 --> 01:25.708
And you've been working on a method of?

01:26.000 --> 01:30.042
I've perfected a method
of transplanting the (bleep)

01:30.333 --> 01:31.333
From one man to another.

01:31.417 --> 01:32.417
The technique is there.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.750
All I need is to find a man
who has lost his (bleep)

01:36.042 --> 01:39.583
And a spare (bleep)
to transplant in its place.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.458
(beeping)

01:50.583 --> 01:52.083
I'm sorry, Mr. Whitbread,

01:52.375 --> 01:54.417
but I did tell you it was a family show.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.188
Mr. Shelley, if your view prevails,

01:56.458 --> 01:57.778
there will be no (bleep) families

01:57.833 --> 01:58.913
to watch your (bleep) show.

02:00.042 --> 02:02.333
What do you expect me
to call the fucking thing?

02:03.458 --> 02:05.833
My nanny used to call it Percy.

I'd know it anywhere.

My God, what are we going to do?

05:30.708 --> 05:33.292
Is that you, Charles, dear?

05:33.583 --> 05:34.250
[Charles] Yes, it is.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.167
I thought so.

05:36.458 --> 05:37.042
What are we going to do?

05:37.333 --> 05:42.125
Sweetheart, I'm just
having a little lie down.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.458
That's right, that's what I'm having.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.792
[Charles] Helga, open the door!

05:47.083 --> 05:48.875
Do something, come on.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.184
[Male] I'll hide on the balcony.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.208
[Charles] Helga!

05:52.292 --> 05:52.833
[Helga] Hurry!

05:53.125 --> 05:53.833
[Charles] Open the door, Helga!

05:54.125 --> 05:55.208
I'm coming, darling.

05:57.333 --> 06:00.208
We haven't got a balcony.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.559
[Charles] Damn it, I
thought I was in Muriel's place.

06:02.583 --> 06:03.583
No!

06:04.125 --> 06:05.125
Hey!

06:08.083 --> 06:10.667
(cars crashing)

06:17.167 --> 06:19.000
He's unclothed.

06:19.292 --> 06:19.833
[Male] He's dead as muck.

06:20.125 --> 06:22.083
[Female] He's still unclothed.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.417
[Male] Yeah, that one's alive.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.708
He'll wish he wasn't.

06:27.708 --> 06:32.625
(siren blaring) (dramatic music)

06:40.542 --> 06:42.208
Better give 'em a red alert.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.125
Tell 'em we've got Percy back here.

06:44.417 --> 06:45.737
[Eric] Eric Idle III to septic.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.667
Herald, do you read me?

06:48.583 --> 06:50.458
We read you, Eric Idle III.

06:50.750 --> 06:51.750
Come in, over.

06:52.917 --> 06:53.917
[Eric] Percy located!

06:54.208 --> 06:55.500
Percy located!

06:55.792 --> 06:58.375
Repeat, Percy located and in transit.

06:58.667 --> 07:02.125
Yes, your rabbit's foot
has brought some luck.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.500
Eric Idle Ill,

07:03.792 --> 07:04.792
please comply with brief

07:05.000 --> 07:08.042
and state whether subject
is Percy plus or Percy minus,

07:08.333 --> 07:09.000
over.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.583
It's a classic double septic, Herald,

07:11.875 --> 07:13.417
plug and socket.

07:13.708 --> 07:14.250
Repeat,

07:14.542 --> 07:16.182
- plug and socket.
- Your message received,

07:16.292 --> 07:17.292
Eric Idle Ill.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.375
We aren't deaf entirely, out.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.833
I wonder what we'll do with this old one.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.125
(girls giggling)

07:23.333 --> 07:25.059
Make a change from a
rabbit's foot, wouldn't it?

07:25.083 --> 07:26.208
(girls giggling)

07:26.500 --> 07:29.458
Please girls, I'll have to
plug into Professor Whitbread.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.083
(girls giggling)

07:31.375 --> 07:32.583
Professor Whitbread, please.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.917
(whistling)

07:36.208 --> 07:39.167
(phone beeping)

07:39.458 --> 07:40.542
Miss Elder here.

07:40.833 --> 07:42.167
Yes?

07:42.458 --> 07:43.458
And you say?

07:44.583 --> 07:45.583
Thank you, Pat.

07:45.750 --> 07:48.542
(victorious music)

08:02.458 --> 08:05.042
(phone beeping)

08:06.500 --> 08:07.167
Whitbread here.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.000
[Miss Elder] Hello sir.

08:08.292 --> 08:08.833
Yes, Miss Elder?

08:09.125 --> 08:10.833
[Miss Elder] Percy is on his way.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.125
They've got two and
they're a matching pair.

08:14.542 --> 08:15.875
They haven't?

08:16.167 --> 08:18.667
[Miss Elder] Yes, plus and minus.

08:18.958 --> 08:23.167
Miss Elder, I'm about
to sew my way into history.

08:23.458 --> 08:24.658
[Miss Elder] Good luck, sir.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.542
(victorious music)

08:39.167 --> 08:40.458
Good afternoon, mister?

08:40.750 --> 08:42.833
Anthony, Edwin Anthony.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.625
A bit of an accident, have we?

08:47.083 --> 08:48.833
I was carrying a chandelier.

08:49.125 --> 08:50.167
Just relax, Mr. Anthony

08:51.208 --> 08:52.568
we're gonna make a new man of you.

08:53.708 --> 08:56.125
Try to think of something
pleasant, that helps.

08:56.417 --> 08:57.417
Try the little woman.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.792
Not her, man, your wife.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.417
(gentle music)

09:16.625 --> 09:17.333
Hazel?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.000
Sorry darling, I can't stop.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.375
I'm in a tearing hurry.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.042
(gentle music)

09:29.667 --> 09:31.125
[Edwin] Can I help you?

09:31.417 --> 09:33.458
Is everything for sale?

09:33.750 --> 09:35.042
Just the furniture.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.413
And what about the
(speaking in foreign language)?

09:38.792 --> 09:41.083
Furniture embraces
(speaking in foreign language).

09:41.375 --> 09:42.375
How very cozy.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.917
What would you say the chandelier is worth?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.833
To me, priceless, market value 400.

09:50.125 --> 09:50.667
Dollars?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.417
Pounds, Jeremy Skrow.

09:53.625 --> 09:54.833
And who is Mr. Skrow?

09:56.375 --> 09:57.917
Chandelier maker to George IV.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.542
It's very well hung.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.042
$400, you said?

10:07.333 --> 10:08.333
Pounds.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.000
(engine roaring)

10:17.375 --> 10:21.125
Hello squire, you all right?

10:21.417 --> 10:22.684
Still flogging nation's heritage

10:22.708 --> 10:23.708
to the colonies, I see.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.792
Yes.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.167
Hazel's upstairs, is she?

10:30.250 --> 10:33.375
For pounds, I shall want
it delivered personally.

10:34.958 --> 10:35.958
Of course.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.333
My address.

10:39.625 --> 10:40.708
I'm just round the corner.

10:42.417 --> 10:46.500
I just can't wait to tinkle it.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.583
(mysterious music)

11:02.458 --> 11:04.083
(laughing)

11:04.375 --> 11:05.375
Yes.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.500
(laughing)

11:07.792 --> 11:08.792
I like that.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.625
(purring)

11:12.875 --> 11:14.250
Oh, hello.

11:14.542 --> 11:15.542
We were just leaving.

11:16.875 --> 11:17.917
Will you be all right?

11:19.042 --> 11:20.750
Where will you stay in Athens?

11:21.042 --> 11:23.167
Well, we don't know
yet, but I'll phone you.

11:24.708 --> 11:25.375
Are you ready, James?

11:25.667 --> 11:27.309
Yeah, you're right, that is very pretty.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.917
What a pity I'm married.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.375
Why should that stop you?

11:33.792 --> 11:36.250
James, would you mind
taking the cases down

11:36.542 --> 11:37.833
and I'll join you in a minute?

11:38.125 --> 11:39.167
Yeah, of course.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.417
I'll see you then, squire.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.875
Hazel, how long will you be away?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.684
What sort of a vicious remark was that?

11:53.708 --> 11:56.125
And do you have to
embarrass me in front of James?

11:56.417 --> 11:57.625
I go filming for a few weeks

11:57.917 --> 11:59.437
and you get jealous and throw a moody.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.958
You're my wife, aren't you?

12:01.250 --> 12:02.809
Do you imagine I'm going to enjoy myself

12:02.833 --> 12:04.917
stuck in some tatty hotel
in the middle of Athens?

12:05.208 --> 12:08.000
You've managed
perfectly well in the past.

12:17.208 --> 12:19.000
I've had that night dress for two years

12:19.292 --> 12:21.792
only you've never bothered to notice it.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.083
Really?

12:23.208 --> 12:24.208
Yes, really.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.042
Will you ring me?

12:35.333 --> 12:37.917
Yes, you don't deserve it.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.583
(sad music)

12:46.958 --> 12:49.708
(whimsical music)

13:04.375 --> 13:06.458
(beeping)

13:11.875 --> 13:12.875
Ah, you're awake.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.583
How do you feel, no pain?

13:19.875 --> 13:20.875
No.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.667
Where am I?

13:30.458 --> 13:32.542
What have you done to me?

13:32.833 --> 13:34.018
Oh my God, you've cut off my legs.

13:34.042 --> 13:34.708
Ah not at all.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.042
There's nothing missing.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.333
Quite the opposite.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.250
I don't believe you.

13:39.375 --> 13:40.375
Do you feel that?

13:40.583 --> 13:41.167
Yes.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.208
And that?

13:44.250 --> 13:45.667
Yes.

13:45.958 --> 13:46.958
And that?

13:49.542 --> 13:51.875
No, I didn't feel anything.

13:52.167 --> 13:52.708
What did you touch?

13:53.000 --> 13:53.542
What did you touch?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.458
You're a bit numb at the moment.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.833
It'll be better when the
anesthetic wears off.

13:58.917 --> 14:00.167
Now the screen's only there

14:00.458 --> 14:03.542
to stop you from touching your dressings.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.060
But, but, what did you mean just now,

14:06.125 --> 14:07.583
quite the opposite?

14:12.875 --> 14:15.000
Your surgeon will have
a little surprise for you

14:15.292 --> 14:16.417
in the morning.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.148
Oh, but it's good news, Mr. Anthony,

14:18.417 --> 14:19.792
take my word for it.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.917
The operation was a great success.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.476
We just want to wait a few hours

14:24.500 --> 14:26.542
and see how it stands
up in the light of day.

14:28.292 --> 14:31.292
(victorious music)

14:31.583 --> 14:33.167
Good morning, Mr. Anthony.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.042
Morning.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.333
In the pink are we?

14:36.958 --> 14:38.417
Splendid.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.750
(dramatic happy music)

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Well time to open the Book of Revelations.

14:51.583 --> 14:52.792
Sharp things, chandeliers.

14:56.083 --> 14:57.083
How long?

14:57.125 --> 14:58.125
Huh?

14:58.417 --> 15:00.167
How long have I got?

15:00.458 --> 15:04.125
I don't really mind, I just
want to know how long?

15:04.417 --> 15:05.726
Young man, we mustn't be greedy.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.875
Length isn't all that important.

15:08.167 --> 15:09.208
It is to me.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.083
No, no, no, no, that's a fallacy.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.083
You ask any sexologist

15:12.375 --> 15:13.726
and in any case, I think you'll find,

15:13.750 --> 15:16.125
that we have, as the
saying goes, done you proud.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.625
Particularly as this is the
first transplant of its kind.

15:20.917 --> 15:24.042
You and I, Mr. Anthony,

15:24.333 --> 15:25.500
have made history.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.792
Transplant?

15:28.667 --> 15:30.500
No, not your heart, nothing so trite.

15:30.792 --> 15:31.833
You aren't even lukewarm.

15:33.292 --> 15:36.625
Lungs, liver, kidneys?

15:36.917 --> 15:37.917
Getting warmer.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.792
Well if it's none of those,

15:41.083 --> 15:42.792
what else is there?

15:43.083 --> 15:45.500
(dramatic music)

15:45.792 --> 15:46.417
Not?

15:46.708 --> 15:47.417
Exactly.

15:47.708 --> 15:49.667
What television would call your beep beep.

15:49.958 --> 15:53.167
You represent a great triumph
for surgery, Mr. Anthony.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.667
You're the first,

15:55.958 --> 15:59.125
the only man on this
planet with someone else's.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.417
I wrote to Judith,

16:08.708 --> 16:09.958
told her about you and me.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.083
Said not to expect me home.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.375
You wrote to her?

16:14.708 --> 16:15.708
Mmm.

16:16.708 --> 16:20.375
Well, she gets a bit neurotic, you know?

16:21.667 --> 16:25.208
If I told her to her face,
she might cause a rile.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
When did you write?

16:27.292 --> 16:28.667
Sunday.

16:28.958 --> 16:30.000
Then she has it by now?

16:31.125 --> 16:32.542
Not necessarily.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.125
Oh.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.667
I thought I'd wait until you told Edwin.

16:38.958 --> 16:39.958
Ladies first.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.208
Not in adultery.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.833
You don't trust me.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.958
I adore you.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.333
If we can't live together, I think,

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
I think I'll die.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.958
But if I tell Judith

16:57.250 --> 16:58.730
and then you go and change your mind,

16:58.917 --> 17:00.292
I'm gonna look a right nit.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.667
What if I tell Edwin,

17:01.958 --> 17:03.792
and then you change your mind?

17:04.083 --> 17:05.250
You don't know him.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.208
He'll go on and on about it

17:08.167 --> 17:11.458
like a vegetarian complaining
someone had pinched his steak.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.750
Caviar, darling.

17:13.917 --> 17:16.083
(giggling)

17:22.792 --> 17:25.083
What are we gonna do then?

17:25.375 --> 17:30.167
Well we don't want to
feel we can't trust each other.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.750
I know.

17:32.042 --> 17:33.042
What?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.708
You tell Edwin.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Me?

17:36.708 --> 17:37.708
Oh no.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.208
And I'll post your letter to Julie.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.250
That way we don't have to trust each other.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.083
What a clever little girl you are.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.292
It's a bloody liberty.

18:00.583 --> 18:01.917
Do you realize Sister Flanagan,

18:02.208 --> 18:04.000
they've not only infringed Magna Carta,

18:04.292 --> 18:06.083
but most of the 10 commandments as well?

18:06.375 --> 18:07.684
Without one of those little things,

18:07.708 --> 18:09.208
you can't break the best ones.

18:10.167 --> 18:11.167
Do you know?

18:11.458 --> 18:12.625
Know what, Mr. Anthony?

18:12.917 --> 18:13.458
Who's it was?

18:13.750 --> 18:14.458
I've been here two weeks now

18:14.750 --> 18:15.833
but no one will tell me.

18:16.125 --> 18:16.750
Afraid not.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.458
No one outside
Mr. Whitbread's team knows that.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.190
Now that is a secret, Mr. Anthony,

18:21.375 --> 18:22.375
even from you.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.042
We've decided to use the same principle

18:25.333 --> 18:26.708
as in the adoption of a child.

18:27.667 --> 18:31.542
No one is to know where
the little mite has come from.

18:31.833 --> 18:34.417
Let us merely regard it
as a penis from heaven.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.167
(laughing)

18:36.458 --> 18:38.643
In due course, a statement
will be released to the press

18:38.667 --> 18:40.187
regarding the nature of the operation.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.898
Now your name will not be mentioned,

18:42.083 --> 18:43.083
nor will the donor's.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.000
Well what's my wife going to say?

18:46.292 --> 18:47.625
I mean suppose she notices.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.083
I would've thought
she was bound to notice.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.458
Yes, of course.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.250
Hazel doesn't miss much, you know?

18:55.375 --> 18:57.542
Apart from which she
has an excellent memory.

18:59.375 --> 19:02.208
I'm sure she'll take to
the little fellow in no time.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.083
I've got to take to it first.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.351
I mean supposing I don't like it,

19:06.375 --> 19:07.417
can I exchange it?

19:08.667 --> 19:11.667
Mr. Anthony, we are a
hospital, not a boutique.

19:12.958 --> 19:14.478
I hope you won't take this personally,

19:14.542 --> 19:16.167
but the staff have given it a name,

19:16.458 --> 19:18.542
something well perhaps a little prosaic.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.542
Go on, I can stand it.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.833
Percy.

19:23.250 --> 19:23.917
Look, it's not just there

19:24.208 --> 19:25.601
for the sake of appearances, is it?

19:25.625 --> 19:26.833
I mean it does work?

19:27.125 --> 19:28.125
Oh, most certainly.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.375
Oh it's been thoroughly overhauled.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.042
Perhaps you let me see it sometime.

19:36.583 --> 19:37.583
That's right.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.917
I booked it person to person,

19:40.208 --> 19:43.250
to Edwin Anthony, that's it.

19:43.542 --> 19:44.542
Yes, I'll hold.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.125
Here you are.

19:47.417 --> 19:48.708
Ah no, I'm not gonna tell him.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Coward.

19:50.042 --> 19:51.458
I just couldn't do it.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.976
Is that the way you keep a bargain?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
And after I posted
that letter to your wife?

19:56.250 --> 19:57.250
You what?

19:57.458 --> 19:58.708
This morning.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.500
I've got rid of your wife for you.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.375
Now it's your turn.

20:02.667 --> 20:03.208
You.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.542
Yes?

20:04.833 --> 20:06.917
[Female] I'm putting you through now.

20:07.208 --> 20:07.750
Hello?

20:08.042 --> 20:09.083
Hello, hello squire.

20:10.958 --> 20:12.125
Oh, it's you.

20:12.417 --> 20:13.417
Yeah.

20:13.708 --> 20:14.250
Listen squire,

20:14.542 --> 20:16.625
look, I'm sorry to be
the bearer of sad tidings,

20:16.917 --> 20:19.792
but Hazel and I are going away together.

20:21.042 --> 20:22.226
Yeah I don't mean working this time.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.250
I mean forever.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.333
She asked me to tell you.

20:26.875 --> 20:27.875
Is Hazel there?

20:28.125 --> 20:29.833
Yes, she is.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.083
Well I think you better
put her on, don't you?

20:32.375 --> 20:33.375
Certainly.

20:33.542 --> 20:36.417
Edwin, look I am sorry,

20:36.708 --> 20:38.500
but God knows I've tried.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.833
I just can't put up with it any longer.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.667
You work, you sleep,

20:42.958 --> 20:44.309
and when you do talk, you say nothing.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.333
It's too much.

20:46.292 --> 20:47.972
And all the time, your horrible suspicions

20:48.000 --> 20:49.542
about me and James.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.833
Seem to be true.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.208
Where are you going with him?

20:53.500 --> 20:56.417
Sardinia for a while anyway.

20:56.708 --> 20:57.917
Can he afford to keep you?

20:58.208 --> 20:59.292
Oh, didn't I tell you?

20:59.583 --> 21:00.833
He's just got a major film.

21:02.208 --> 21:05.125
I'll be having a few
personal things collected.

21:05.417 --> 21:06.958
The removal van will call for them.

21:08.542 --> 21:10.417
Hazel, I'm going to tell you something.

21:10.708 --> 21:11.958
Might make a difference.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.833
[Female] I'm afraid your time is up.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.500
I will have to cut you off.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.500
Listen, I've had a transplant,

21:18.792 --> 21:20.125
a very successful one.

21:20.417 --> 21:22.250
- Hello?
- Hello? Hello?

21:22.542 --> 21:23.542
What did you say?

21:23.708 --> 21:24.708
Hello?

21:24.792 --> 21:25.792
Hello?

21:26.042 --> 21:26.583
Hello?

21:26.875 --> 21:27.542
Hello?

21:27.833 --> 21:28.833
Hello?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.458
It was a terrible line,

21:32.500 --> 21:33.958
I couldn't hear a word he said.

21:34.250 --> 21:34.792
Oh.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.458
Anyway, he heard me.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.833
(giggling)

21:43.583 --> 21:45.083
Morning, Mr. Anthony.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.601
We can get up for a little while tomorrow.

21:46.625 --> 21:47.625
Oh, thank you.

21:47.667 --> 21:48.708
Take it easy,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.600
we don't want to undo all the good work.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.684
Don't you think it's
about time I had a look?

21:52.708 --> 21:55.042
Everyone else seems to have had one.

21:55.333 --> 21:55.958
Good Lord, haven't
they shown it to you yet?

21:56.250 --> 21:57.833
No and it is mine.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.684
Well it may come as
a bit of a shock at first,

21:59.708 --> 22:02.292
sort of like getting a new face.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.625
(laughing)

22:09.125 --> 22:10.125
Christ.

22:11.208 --> 22:11.875
Oh come now.

22:12.167 --> 22:12.708
Christ.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.600
It'll be all right, it's very healthy.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.875
It's what it bloody
looks like that bothers me.

22:17.833 --> 22:19.750
Morning, Mr. Anthony.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.833
Go on, it's a wonder to behold.

22:30.542 --> 22:31.768
Mr. Anthony refuses to be drawn

22:31.792 --> 22:33.333
on the subject of his private life,

22:33.625 --> 22:34.768
but I have formed certain conclusions

22:34.792 --> 22:36.875
and I fear that what we have given him

22:37.167 --> 22:37.708
is not likely to suffer

22:38.000 --> 22:40.167
from the effects of excessive usage.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.458
Call me vain, Miss Elder,

22:41.708 --> 22:43.042
but when I construct a Maserati

22:43.333 --> 22:43.875
I like to think of it

22:44.167 --> 22:45.917
as leaving the garage from time to time.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.583
I want you to befriend him.

22:48.875 --> 22:51.083
I'm not sure I'm the
sort of friend he needs.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.750
I don't think I could handle it.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.250
Hello?

22:55.542 --> 22:56.083
Yeah.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.735
He'll be just a minute, thank you.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.708
Keep his mind on sex and off his wife.

23:01.792 --> 23:02.875
We don't want Mr. Anthony

23:03.167 --> 23:04.458
failing his dry run next week.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.333
Miss Elder, perhaps you would care to?

23:09.375 --> 23:10.458
With a man?

23:10.750 --> 23:11.792
Oh, just a thought.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.208
But I do have a
suggestion, Mr. Whitbread.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.500
What you need is a girl

23:15.625 --> 23:18.583
who's an out and out stunner, a darling.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.542
It so happens there's a place I know.

23:21.583 --> 23:24.250
Purely by reputation of course.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.917
(gentle music)

23:31.708 --> 23:32.828
Hey, meet 12 lovely girls.

23:32.917 --> 23:33.917
Meet the 12 lovely girls.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.917
All as mother nature intended.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.208
Good evening.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.000
12 lovely girls.

23:40.292 --> 23:42.583
Brace up, Miss Elder,
we shan't stay long.

23:42.875 --> 23:43.875
Hello cheeky,

23:44.125 --> 23:45.125
got a friend, have ya?

23:47.083 --> 23:48.458
12 lovely girls,

23:48.750 --> 23:50.042
all as mother nature intended.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.708
(upbeat music)

24:03.292 --> 24:05.375
(moaning)

24:22.125 --> 24:22.833
Who's that?

24:23.125 --> 24:25.625
It's your relief nurse.

24:25.917 --> 24:27.875
Well I'll leave you to it.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.167
Have fun.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.333
Morning, nurse.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.500
Massage?

24:53.042 --> 24:54.958
What's the weather like?

24:56.625 --> 24:57.625
Oh hot.

25:05.750 --> 25:06.750
Excuse me.

25:06.917 --> 25:07.625
Excuse me.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.167
Sorry, where have they got to?

25:09.458 --> 25:10.000
Quiet.

25:10.292 --> 25:12.667
(upbeat music)

25:49.083 --> 25:50.750
Is that matron in there?

25:51.042 --> 25:53.500
(upbeat music)

25:57.667 --> 25:58.375
Ole!

25:58.667 --> 25:59.667
Ole!

25:59.750 --> 26:02.125
(upbeat music)

26:45.083 --> 26:47.208
Show us the patient, for god's sake.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.083
We don't need to see the woman.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.000
Oh no, it's a shame.

26:52.167 --> 26:54.750
(upbeat music)

27:10.542 --> 27:11.542
Yes, that's it.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.083
Come on, Percy.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.792
He's coming up on the rails now.

27:16.083 --> 27:19.708
He's coming up fast.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.542
Oh, well done, Percy.

27:23.958 --> 27:25.125
Come on, Percy.

27:26.958 --> 27:28.833
That's it, Percy.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.125
Keep it up.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.292
Well done, Percy.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.375
It works, it really works!

27:37.667 --> 27:40.542
(computer exploding)

27:45.000 --> 27:47.250
No, it can't be matron.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.667
Congratulations!

27:50.667 --> 27:52.500
Time for a tea break.

27:56.583 --> 27:57.583
Oh crustal.

27:59.583 --> 28:00.583
Oh gosh.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.000
Would you call the
operation a great success, sir?

28:05.250 --> 28:06.250
I suppose.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.617
Was it all plain sailing,
so to speak, Mr. Whitbread?

28:09.875 --> 28:12.833
Well, there were a few
ticklish moments, you know?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.643
But it's all part of the fun, isn't it?

28:14.667 --> 28:16.059
I mean a good general does his homework

28:16.083 --> 28:18.542
and I flatter myself I
planned it that well.

28:18.833 --> 28:20.792
All I really needed was a suitable subject

28:21.083 --> 28:23.750
and objects.

28:24.042 --> 28:26.042
(giggling)

28:26.333 --> 28:27.393
[Male] Was the patient married?

28:27.417 --> 28:29.375
[Male] How long did the operation last?

28:29.667 --> 28:33.208
Will there be any further
transplants of the sort?

28:33.500 --> 28:36.208
Will it be available
on the National Health?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.833
Can I have one, please?

28:38.125 --> 28:39.226
Well that'll be all for today, gentlemen.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.333
I shall make a further statement
when the occasion arises.

28:42.625 --> 28:45.000
(happy music)

29:09.833 --> 29:11.042
Use the phone?

29:11.333 --> 29:12.792
[Female] Yes, sir.

29:20.958 --> 29:22.125
Hello, momsie.

29:22.417 --> 29:22.958
Hello, Rosemary.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.958
Have you been a good girl?

29:25.250 --> 29:27.208
Oh yes, I was ever so polite.

29:27.500 --> 29:29.667
That's right, they gave
us everything but the name.

29:29.958 --> 29:32.083
No name of donor, no name of patient.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.455
The operation was performed

29:33.583 --> 29:36.208
by a Professor Emmanuel Whitbread.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.042
[Male] Pint?

29:37.333 --> 29:38.958
Yes, a pint, perfect.

29:39.250 --> 29:39.833
[Male] It's all right, I'll get it.

29:40.125 --> 29:40.667
Sorry.

29:40.958 --> 29:42.250
And his team.

29:42.542 --> 29:43.542
No names there either.

29:45.042 --> 29:46.242
I'll stewage around here a bit

29:46.500 --> 29:49.167
and see if I can't chat
up one of the nurses.

29:49.458 --> 29:52.708
Okay.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.958
How's that pint going?

29:55.250 --> 29:57.792
{(woman giggling)

29:59.375 --> 30:00.625
[Rita] Oh mom.

30:03.625 --> 30:04.958
Miss La Rousse,

30:05.917 --> 30:06.917
Arthur Purdee,

30:07.125 --> 30:09.500
I did an article on you a few months back.

30:09.792 --> 30:10.333
You know with a photograph

30:10.625 --> 30:12.542
of you standing between
the two vintage cars.

30:12.833 --> 30:16.292
Oh yes, I remember.

30:16.583 --> 30:19.375
You called it Girl with Bristles.

30:19.667 --> 30:20.667
This is momsie.

30:20.875 --> 30:21.542
How do you do?

30:21.833 --> 30:22.375
How do you do?

30:22.667 --> 30:24.067
You've just come out of hospital?

30:24.167 --> 30:25.250
No, but I have.

30:25.542 --> 30:27.875
Well I mean I was there
professionally actually.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.247
What, in your profession?

30:29.417 --> 30:31.542
Well it was the strangest thing.

30:31.833 --> 30:33.913
They made me go into this
room and then they had me

30:34.167 --> 30:35.167
(clearing throat)

30:35.292 --> 30:38.042
Young man, my daughter's
taken a solemn oath

30:38.333 --> 30:39.875
not to tell anyone.

30:40.167 --> 30:43.042
It could only be broken for money.

30:43.333 --> 30:46.458
(cash register ringing)

30:47.458 --> 30:49.378
[Reporter] This must
surely be a unique moment

30:49.583 --> 30:50.583
in medical history.

30:50.625 --> 30:51.851
Well, I suppose it probably is.

30:51.875 --> 30:55.250
I certainly don't know of
any similar transplants,

30:55.542 --> 30:56.125
not in living memory.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.833
I don't know if they
Chinese ever attempted it.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.875
Well they're doing some research

31:02.167 --> 31:03.167
into that at the moment.

31:03.417 --> 31:03.958
[Reporter] Is that right?

31:04.250 --> 31:06.542
They've always been a
hobby of mine of course.

31:06.833 --> 31:09.333
[Reporter] Will there
be any further transplants

31:09.625 --> 31:10.750
of this sort of?

31:12.042 --> 31:14.875
(victorious music)

31:29.917 --> 31:31.375
Ah, there you are.

31:32.667 --> 31:33.792
Where am I going?

31:34.083 --> 31:35.163
Is anyone going to tell me?

31:35.333 --> 31:37.000
To the country, Mr. Anthony.

31:37.292 --> 31:38.750
It's all for your own protection.

31:39.042 --> 31:40.362
Things are hotting up down below.

31:40.625 --> 31:41.625
I'm not surprised.

31:41.917 --> 31:43.625
You'll love it there.

31:43.917 --> 31:44.917
Here we go.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.333
(upbeat music)

32:42.292 --> 32:44.167
Mr. Whitbread planned this months ago,

32:44.458 --> 32:45.578
a quiet place in the country

32:45.708 --> 32:47.417
where the newspapers can't find you.

32:47.708 --> 32:49.167
And aren't you a lucky devil,

32:49.458 --> 32:50.458
no work to do,

32:50.583 --> 32:52.417
just two whole months with peace and rest.

32:52.708 --> 32:53.250
Two months?

32:53.542 --> 32:54.768
Well we can't hurry nature, can we?

32:54.792 --> 32:57.208
We shall want to show you off, Mr. Anthony.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.020
Doctors will be coming to look at you.

32:59.292 --> 33:01.132
Yes, well I don't want
doctors peering at me

33:01.417 --> 33:03.018
for two whole months, thank you very much.

33:03.042 --> 33:05.667
Personally, I find the
whole business very repellent

33:05.958 --> 33:08.083
but for Mr. Whitbread.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.125
[Edwin] Excuse me.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.875
Mr. Anthony, you mustn't.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.708
It's too early to go straining things.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.625
(soft rock music)

34:19.667 --> 34:22.750
There are some volunteers
outside, Mr. Whitbread.

34:23.042 --> 34:25.333
They want to offer their
help with further transplants.

34:25.625 --> 34:27.542
Are they buyers or sellers?

34:27.833 --> 34:30.250
Buyers, what we want is sellers.

34:31.250 --> 34:33.125
We haven't got the materials to work with.

34:33.417 --> 34:34.417
We can't get the parts.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.542
There must be something
we can do about that, sir.

34:37.833 --> 34:38.417
What sort of thing?

34:38.708 --> 34:39.250
Well I don't know

34:39.542 --> 34:41.958
but I've noticed most men
have a very friendly feeling

34:42.250 --> 34:43.792
towards those little devils of theirs.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.123
I'm sure men I'd like to
think of them raising hell

34:46.208 --> 34:48.542
after they'd passed away themselves.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.833
Go on sister Flanagan.

34:50.833 --> 34:54.875
Well, I haven't really
thought it out yet, but

34:59.625 --> 35:04.542
(phone ringing) (groovy rock music)

35:33.125 --> 35:35.292
(laughing)

35:39.000 --> 35:41.083
Oh come on June, you know you would.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.393
What do you take me for?

35:42.417 --> 35:44.708
If my Harry came to me with one of those,

35:45.000 --> 35:46.976
I'd tell him to take it
straight back where he got it.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.583
Oh, you are awful.

35:48.875 --> 35:49.893
Anyway, you're always complaining

35:49.917 --> 35:51.333
about Harry in that respect.

35:51.625 --> 35:53.583
He wouldn't do any better with a new one.

35:53.875 --> 35:55.958
A bad workman always blames his tools.

35:59.542 --> 36:02.125
I mean they don't even
tell you where they get it from.

36:02.417 --> 36:04.917
Well I don't like the idea of that.

36:05.208 --> 36:06.728
I mean you never know where it's been.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.000
What's it matter?

36:08.292 --> 36:10.417
As long as you know where it's going.

36:10.708 --> 36:12.167
No, no, it's fishy.

36:12.458 --> 36:13.858
My George came home to me and said,

36:14.125 --> 36:16.417
"Here Kate, look what I've got"

36:16.708 --> 36:19.000
I'd tell him to go back and get a pedigree.

36:19.292 --> 36:20.958
Oh no, not in my house.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.625
Thank you, thank you, lovely darling.

36:27.583 --> 36:28.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:28.542 --> 36:29.083
you'll have to excuse the way I'm walking.

36:29.375 --> 36:30.917
I've just come out of hospital.

36:31.208 --> 36:32.208
I'll tell you what,

36:32.375 --> 36:32.917
they're a funny lot in there.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.417
They had me in stitches.

36:34.708 --> 36:36.308
It wasn't too bad when they put them in,

36:36.417 --> 36:38.137
but when them nurses come to take them out,

36:38.333 --> 36:40.833
oh blimey, I didn't know
whether I was going or coming.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.500
(laughing)

36:43.792 --> 36:46.417
Did you hear about the
fella with the transplant?

36:46.708 --> 36:47.708
No, not you bubba,

36:47.875 --> 36:50.250
you can't remember far back as all that.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.059
Anyway, the fella with the transplant,

36:52.083 --> 36:52.625
he went to the doctor, he said,

36:52.917 --> 36:55.083
"Doctor, every time I sneeze, I feel sexy."

36:55.375 --> 36:57.583
So the doctor says,
"What are you taking for it?"

36:57.875 --> 37:00.500
So the tranplant fella says, "Pepper."

37:00.792 --> 37:03.500
But did you see what they said in The Sun?

37:03.792 --> 37:05.583
"The swingiest transplant".

37:05.875 --> 37:07.675
Well I went to this
transplant fella, I said,

37:07.875 --> 37:08.583
"Does it swing then?"

37:08.875 --> 37:10.000
He said, "Only when I run."

37:10.292 --> 37:12.833
(crowd laughing)

37:14.167 --> 37:17.083
She is furious, jealousy, pure jealousy.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.333
She wants equal rights for women.

37:19.625 --> 37:20.167
I'm not kidding,

37:20.458 --> 37:21.000
it's like being married

37:21.292 --> 37:22.393
to the Crisis and Income Board.

37:22.417 --> 37:24.167
Every time I get a rise, she freezes it.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.625
(crowd laughing)

37:27.917 --> 37:28.458
Well that's it,

37:28.750 --> 37:29.292
I've always been brought up

37:29.583 --> 37:31.708
never to look a gift horse in the mouth.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.625
After all, they're already
talking about monkey's ass.

37:34.917 --> 37:37.458
(crowd laughing)

37:43.208 --> 37:44.750
Did you see what The Sun says?

37:45.042 --> 37:46.250
The swingiest transplant.

37:46.542 --> 37:48.226
So I went to this
transplant fella and I said,

37:48.250 --> 37:49.250
"Does it swing then?"

37:49.417 --> 37:52.208
The swingiest transplant, transplant.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.667
They're talking about
monkey's ass, monkey's ass.

37:55.958 --> 37:57.917

I can't sleep.

39:09.125 --> 39:10.833
I've even been insulted by a gorilla.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.042
Oh, you poor dear man.

39:13.333 --> 39:15.458
That's why they were taking you away,

39:15.750 --> 39:16.750
to protect you.

39:17.042 --> 39:19.125
Yes, well I don't need
that sort of protection.

39:19.417 --> 39:20.737
And no one's going to make me go.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.583
No one can make you.

39:22.875 --> 39:25.000
You're entitled to discharge yourself.

39:25.292 --> 39:27.750
You mean they're not looking for me?

39:28.042 --> 39:28.583
They're too busy

39:28.875 --> 39:30.518
trying to think up a
good story for the press.

39:30.542 --> 39:33.208
Sister Flanagan, couldn't you help me?

39:33.500 --> 39:36.792
Look, you see, I must know who's it was.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.083
What?

39:39.500 --> 39:41.000
Oh that.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.708
Look, I've got to live with it.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.417
I must know who the donor was.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.768
Kathy, my dear, have
you got those sketches?

39:49.792 --> 39:50.792
Excuse me.

39:52.625 --> 39:55.208
[Edwin] I said I must
know where it came from.

39:56.667 --> 39:58.042
I understand, my dear.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.708
Yes, of course, I'd love to meet your aunt.

40:03.708 --> 40:04.708
I'll see you there.

40:06.292 --> 40:08.708
The British Museum four o'clock.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Goodbye.

40:15.292 --> 40:17.792
(gentle music)

40:47.292 --> 40:48.458
Ah.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.030
They say the ancient Egyptians

40:50.167 --> 40:51.917
were the first with the transplant.

40:52.208 --> 40:53.568
One of the mummies had it sewn on.

40:53.792 --> 40:55.292
You seem to know a lot about it.

40:55.583 --> 40:56.663
Oh, I have a gift for it.

40:56.833 --> 40:58.375
Some people have it for music,

40:58.667 --> 41:00.375
I have it for those little fellas.

41:00.667 --> 41:01.750
There you are,

41:02.042 --> 41:03.792
the list of all the deaths at the hospital

41:04.083 --> 41:05.583
the day you were brought in.

41:05.875 --> 41:07.515
Now I don't know which one of them it was

41:07.625 --> 41:08.167
and if I did know,

41:08.458 --> 41:10.292
it'd be more than my job was worth.

41:10.583 --> 41:13.208
Mum's the word, Sister Flanagan.

41:14.500 --> 41:15.917
God, it's like happy families.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.667

43:39.833 --> 43:41.792
Over there, she's the one that moves.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.208
Miss Hyde?

43:46.500 --> 43:47.542
That's right.

43:47.833 --> 43:48.833
Who are you?

43:49.083 --> 43:49.625
Percy.

43:49.917 --> 43:51.583
Is that your Christian or surname?

43:51.875 --> 43:52.875
Mr. Percy.

43:53.542 --> 43:55.333
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Percy.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.333
I see you wearing a ring.

44:00.542 --> 44:03.792
Not really, not now, not anymore.

44:06.042 --> 44:07.917
Ernie, that's my husband,

44:08.208 --> 44:09.568
well my late husband I should say.

44:09.667 --> 44:12.167
He was crushed.

44:12.458 --> 44:13.542
Sorry.

44:13.833 --> 44:14.993
Whole barrel of Burton beer

44:15.042 --> 44:17.292
rolled off the wagon straight onto him.

44:17.583 --> 44:21.500
Now where exactly did it roll onto him?

44:23.125 --> 44:24.125
Just his top?

44:25.708 --> 44:26.708
Terrible.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.333
Ernie would've liked you.

44:30.625 --> 44:31.643
He couldn't stand weak people.

44:31.667 --> 44:32.958
Oh, he was strong?

44:33.250 --> 44:34.333
- Manly.
- Oh yeah?

44:34.625 --> 44:35.917
- I'll say.
- Good.

44:39.292 --> 44:41.083
I don't like too much light, do you?

44:43.333 --> 44:44.500
Depends what I'm doing.

44:45.542 --> 44:46.625
Let's talk about you.

44:47.708 --> 44:48.750
Very uninteresting.

44:54.917 --> 44:55.917
You're a strange one

44:56.167 --> 44:57.625
waiting for me to start it.

44:57.917 --> 45:01.125
Yes well Maggie, things
are a little bit complicated.

45:01.417 --> 45:01.958
Well you can tell me,

45:02.250 --> 45:03.250
I won't tell anyone.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.542
I've just had a little
hospital treatment.

45:06.833 --> 45:08.542
(yelling)

45:08.833 --> 45:10.500
Oh that's very nice I must say.

45:10.792 --> 45:11.832
You need to go along then.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.355
If here's something I've always done,

45:13.583 --> 45:15.208
it's keep myself clean.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.917
No, no, it's just a little surgery.

45:19.208 --> 45:21.125
Hoo, what is it?

45:21.417 --> 45:23.458
Men get such funny things.

45:23.750 --> 45:25.351
I don't even know
what it's called myself,

45:25.375 --> 45:26.375
but it's better now.

45:33.042 --> 45:35.708
(romantic music)

45:40.417 --> 45:41.958
That's because I like you.

45:42.250 --> 45:43.250
Thank you.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.083
You are on the pill?

45:51.833 --> 45:54.708
Well then don't you think
perhaps you should put, you know?

45:57.083 --> 45:58.625
No, Ernie always took care

45:58.917 --> 46:01.333
of that side of the business.

46:01.625 --> 46:02.643
[Edwin] Do you mean you have nothing?

46:02.667 --> 46:04.208
Of course not.

46:04.500 --> 46:05.740
It's a man's job, I always say.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.333
That's a very old fashioned view,

46:08.625 --> 46:10.333
particularly in one so young.

46:24.542 --> 46:26.625
Aren't there still some in his drawer?

46:26.917 --> 46:28.333
No such luck, I'm afraid.

46:28.625 --> 46:29.167
He always carried them in his top pocket

46:29.458 --> 46:30.458
if he had any

46:31.333 --> 46:32.000
or his hip pocket

46:32.292 --> 46:33.917
if it was just slacks and a pullover.

46:38.333 --> 46:39.375
Yes, well that's it.

46:39.667 --> 46:40.667
That's Ernie all over.

46:40.833 --> 46:43.042
Never had a hanky when he sneezed either.

46:43.333 --> 46:43.875
Want a cigarette?

46:44.167 --> 46:45.184
Thought you didn't smoke.

46:45.208 --> 46:46.417
One every Christmas.

46:46.708 --> 46:47.750
This is more like mint.

46:56.458 --> 46:57.458
How,

46:59.458 --> 47:02.750
how well did you know Ernie?

47:03.042 --> 47:04.458
Oh no, not now.

47:05.667 --> 47:07.625
I'd almost forgotten.

47:07.917 --> 47:09.101
Anyway, that's a stupid question.

47:09.125 --> 47:10.285
He was my husband, wasn't he?

47:10.417 --> 47:11.583
Yes, well I mean,

47:11.875 --> 47:13.875
some wives know their
husbands better than others.

47:13.958 --> 47:18.750
I mean they shared each
other's baths, things like that.

47:19.333 --> 47:21.167
What are you going on about?

47:21.458 --> 47:22.000
Look the point is

47:22.292 --> 47:25.500
would you recognize any part of Ernie

47:25.792 --> 47:26.875
were you to see it again?

47:27.958 --> 47:30.500
There's something very weird about you.

47:30.792 --> 47:32.417
Oh no, not about people like you.

47:32.708 --> 47:34.292
You ought to be locked up.

47:34.583 --> 47:35.667
Look, this isn't a joke.

47:35.958 --> 47:37.167
I'll call the police.

47:37.458 --> 47:38.000
Can't you guess?

47:38.292 --> 47:39.292
Guess what?

47:39.583 --> 47:42.000
I'm the penis transplant man.

47:43.167 --> 47:44.167
Never.

47:45.583 --> 47:47.583
Oh I can't believe it.

47:47.875 --> 47:49.417
It couldn't happen to me.

47:49.708 --> 47:50.917
It's like winning the pools.

47:51.958 --> 47:54.208
And you were gonna use it?

47:54.500 --> 47:56.417
That's what it's there for, isn't it?

47:56.708 --> 47:59.833
Oh my, oh I can't make you out at all.

48:00.125 --> 48:02.458
I should've thought
everything was falling into place.

48:03.708 --> 48:06.125
I'm looking for the previous owner.

48:07.583 --> 48:08.250
Ernie?

48:08.542 --> 48:10.417
Well, I had no other way of finding out.

48:11.750 --> 48:13.430
It's a bloody insult, that's what it is.

48:13.708 --> 48:15.548
Not if you look at it
decently and properly.

48:15.833 --> 48:17.250
I'm not gonna look at it at all.

48:17.542 --> 48:19.958
I don't see why you
should feel so bloody insulted.

48:24.042 --> 48:25.167
If it was Ernie's,

48:25.458 --> 48:27.417
this is its' rightful home, isn't it?

48:29.917 --> 48:31.875
It's the way you go about things.

48:32.167 --> 48:34.375
Didn't anyone ever
tell you girls don't like it?

48:35.625 --> 48:38.250
Anyway, what was I
supposed to do, autograph it?

48:40.625 --> 48:43.125
Anyway, Mr. Clever Dick,

48:43.417 --> 48:45.137
as it happens, I did know Ernie quite well.

48:45.375 --> 48:46.975
I may not have shared his bath with him,

48:47.125 --> 48:48.542
but I did use my eyes.

48:48.833 --> 48:50.458
He had a small brown birthmark on his

48:50.750 --> 48:52.833
and if they've sewn it
on the right way round,

48:53.125 --> 48:55.245
it should be on the left
hand side as you look at it.

48:58.542 --> 49:01.292
(dramatic music)

49:20.667 --> 49:21.333
[Edwin] Excuse me.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.708
No I mash me own potatoes,

49:24.000 --> 49:25.958
I can tell stock from butter

49:26.250 --> 49:29.833
and yes, I'd like to swap
my desk for two of the other.

49:31.042 --> 49:31.708
Mrs. Dorset?

49:32.000 --> 49:32.542
She ain't in.

49:32.833 --> 49:33.833
What do you want her for?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.542
You ain't one of them tomb
stone salesmen, are you?

49:36.833 --> 49:38.542
You leave her alone, do you hear?

49:38.833 --> 49:41.542
It just to do with her
husband's death but,

49:41.833 --> 49:42.917
well it's rather personal.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.625
Oh, from the insurance then, are you?

49:45.917 --> 49:46.625
About time, too.

49:46.917 --> 49:48.292
She's over there.

49:48.583 --> 49:49.583
Where?

49:49.750 --> 49:51.042
In the playground.

49:51.333 --> 49:53.542
And don't you try to cheat her none.

49:53.833 --> 49:55.750
Horrible accident like he had,

49:56.042 --> 49:57.333
she ought to get extra.

50:07.917 --> 50:08.957
Joanne, time to go home.

50:09.125 --> 50:10.125
Excuse me.

50:10.167 --> 50:11.583
I'd rather you didn't talk to me.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.583
Are you Mrs. Dorset?

50:13.875 --> 50:16.375
No, that's her over there.

50:18.500 --> 50:21.000
(gentle music)

50:43.500 --> 50:48.417
(bells ringing) (gentle music)

51:13.708 --> 51:15.083
Be pleased to feel at home.

51:17.458 --> 51:18.667
Feast your eyes, dear boy.

51:18.958 --> 51:20.125
That's the real India.

51:21.375 --> 51:23.250
Try to do that in London today

51:23.542 --> 51:24.851
and for all they say about permissiveness

51:24.875 --> 51:26.917
it is worth five years in scrubs.

51:29.708 --> 51:30.748
What do you think of this?

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Acrobatic.

51:35.875 --> 51:38.750
No, no, just patience and determination.

51:40.125 --> 51:42.958
You are interested in
rare and splendid things?

51:43.250 --> 51:44.250
Oh yes.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.042
But actually I came about Herbert Ross.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.250
About Herbert.

51:51.583 --> 51:52.625
You knew him?

51:52.917 --> 51:54.500
We have a common interest I think.

51:56.458 --> 51:59.042
I rather wanted to talk to
someone who knew him.

51:59.333 --> 52:00.833
No one better than I, dear boy.

More brandy, dear boy?

52:38.125 --> 52:39.125
Thank you.

52:42.750 --> 52:44.958
Yes, Herbert was a sweet boy.

52:46.125 --> 52:48.458
Rough, you know, but manly.

52:49.917 --> 52:50.917
I like young people.

52:51.833 --> 52:52.833
He was very handsome.

52:54.292 --> 52:57.583
So are you of course, but not a ladies man.

53:03.500 --> 53:05.625
I tried to convert him to brandy,

53:05.917 --> 53:07.792
but I'm afraid beer was more to his taste.

53:10.500 --> 53:13.250
In the evenings, I
cooked dinner for us both.

53:14.500 --> 53:15.917
I miss that very much.

53:18.958 --> 53:22.542
Mr. Swalton, I am a
ladies man, I'm sorry.

53:23.875 --> 53:26.208
I just wanted to know how Herbert died.

53:27.417 --> 53:29.167
Could you bear to tell me?

53:29.458 --> 53:30.667
He died when his lorry

53:30.958 --> 53:32.542
collided with a petrol tanker.

53:34.708 --> 53:38.667
They say he was burned
beyond recognition, all of him,

53:40.125 --> 53:41.542
a wicked, wicked waste.

53:43.708 --> 53:44.908
Herbert's room is still vacant

53:45.125 --> 53:46.667
if you require accommodation.

53:48.958 --> 53:49.958
That's kind of you

53:51.083 --> 53:52.667
but I have to be near a town.

53:58.500 --> 53:59.500
I'll let myself out

54:01.042 --> 54:02.583
and thank you.

54:02.875 --> 54:03.875
Of course.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.958
(dramatic music)

54:15.250 --> 54:18.375
Mrs. Gold, the fact is I have something

54:18.667 --> 54:21.875
which may have belonged to your husband.

54:22.167 --> 54:22.708
Oh?

54:23.000 --> 54:23.542
Yes.

54:23.833 --> 54:24.917
Or then again, it may not.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Thank you.

54:28.167 --> 54:30.000
My David, he lent everything,

54:30.292 --> 54:32.333
lent, he gave.

54:32.625 --> 54:34.542
I'm a woman, women are hard.

54:34.833 --> 54:37.208
But my David, he would say to me,

54:37.500 --> 54:39.458
we are in this world to share with others.

54:39.750 --> 54:41.208
No matter who has it,

54:41.500 --> 54:43.042
in the end, it will be left behind.

54:44.375 --> 54:45.375
Very true.

54:45.625 --> 54:46.708
What a husband.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Yes?

54:48.125 --> 54:50.208
In every sense, believe me, Mr. Anthony.

54:52.042 --> 54:53.042
They say to me,

54:53.333 --> 54:55.083
"Leah", they say, "You'll marry again."

54:57.083 --> 54:58.083
Mr. Anthony,

54:59.500 --> 55:02.333
when a woman loses a Rolls-Royce,

55:02.625 --> 55:03.792
does she buy herself a Mini?

55:05.708 --> 55:09.792
That man, Mr. Anthony,
he filled you with wolf.

55:10.083 --> 55:11.292
How splendid.

55:11.583 --> 55:13.208
You have children?

55:14.583 --> 55:15.583
Five.

55:16.833 --> 55:18.083
I have none.

55:18.375 --> 55:19.375
So don't smile.

55:21.083 --> 55:23.833
Now, this property of my husband.

55:24.125 --> 55:27.042
Well, it may not actually
have belonged to him.

55:27.333 --> 55:28.726
Well, I'll tell you, don't be nervous.

55:28.750 --> 55:30.500
I'm an honest woman, I won't cheat you.

55:32.125 --> 55:33.125
You have it with you?

55:34.167 --> 55:35.167
Yes.

55:35.375 --> 55:36.375
So show me.

55:39.792 --> 55:41.250
I know what it was.

55:42.542 --> 55:43.542
A book.

55:44.583 --> 55:47.000
What a reader he was, Mr. Anthony,

55:47.292 --> 55:49.208
cover to cover page by page.

55:49.500 --> 55:50.583
That's how he read a book.

55:51.833 --> 55:52.833
You never met him?

55:54.417 --> 55:55.417
Come, I'll show you.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.917
Now this is a forehead,

56:01.208 --> 56:03.292
a brain, Mr. Anthony, the size of

56:06.167 --> 56:07.375
Your husband was a

56:07.667 --> 56:09.250
A genius.

56:09.542 --> 56:12.375
Mrs. Gold, when your
husband was in hospital,

56:12.667 --> 56:15.375
did you give your permission
for a certain operation?

56:15.667 --> 56:19.875
Mr. Anthony, the last
operation my David had,

56:20.167 --> 56:22.375
he was 12 days old.

56:27.417 --> 56:29.375
I thought you were gonna let me do that.

56:29.667 --> 56:31.833
Are you angry 'cause of
what happened last night?

56:32.125 --> 56:33.417
No.

56:33.708 --> 56:35.028
I don't know what came over me.

56:36.042 --> 56:36.708
It must be the heat.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.080
It's never happened before.

56:39.458 --> 56:42.917
What I mean is it generally doesn't happen.

56:43.208 --> 56:44.351
Anyway, I was gonna show you this.

56:44.375 --> 56:46.458
I found this Time's about four days old.

56:46.750 --> 56:48.601
How 'bout that for a boost
for the old country now?

56:48.625 --> 56:49.917
What will they transplant next?

56:51.792 --> 56:53.917
Hey, it's at the Bowchester Royal.

56:55.042 --> 56:57.000
Isn't that where your Ed went?

56:57.292 --> 56:58.292
Oh my God.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.125
Do you want to buy it?

57:13.417 --> 57:14.417
It's dirt cheap.

57:15.917 --> 57:17.417
Mrs. Warrington.

57:17.708 --> 57:18.708
Who are you?

57:20.125 --> 57:23.125
It's you, the late Mr. Guy Warrington?

57:27.792 --> 57:29.750
If you are Mrs. Warrington

57:30.042 --> 57:32.083
Oh bugger, well come on.

57:34.417 --> 57:36.625
Did you give your
permission for a transplant?

57:38.417 --> 57:39.417
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:41.833 --> 57:44.000
Well, you better come inside.

57:50.833 --> 57:53.583
(whimsical music)

57:58.750 --> 57:59.750
Are you a reporter?

58:00.667 --> 58:02.458
No, I deal in antiques.

58:02.750 --> 58:03.750
Do you?

58:04.792 --> 58:07.583
Well what do you think of my
reproduction Welsh dresser?

58:07.875 --> 58:09.125
It's genuine.

58:09.417 --> 58:10.417
Your chairs aren't.

58:11.792 --> 58:13.333
I didn't ask about the chairs.

58:18.208 --> 58:21.333
Who told you I gave my
consent for a transplant?

58:21.625 --> 58:22.625
Did you?

58:22.708 --> 58:24.833
I asked you a question.

58:25.125 --> 58:25.708
I'm the one who got it.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
Who told you it?

58:27.833 --> 58:29.625
Well, it had to go somewhere after all.

58:29.917 --> 58:30.997
That's the point, isn't it?

58:32.000 --> 58:33.143
You don't have to take my word for it.

58:33.167 --> 58:34.708
I mean I can prove it's true.

58:36.333 --> 58:38.533
What do you have in mind
as an identification parade?

58:38.708 --> 58:39.708
No thank you.

58:45.333 --> 58:46.958
Was it your husband?

58:52.833 --> 58:56.042
(knife cutting)

58:56.333 --> 58:58.458
[Mrs. Harrington] Now you
found your man, where to?

59:00.083 --> 59:01.851
Well, it would be nice to
know something about him

59:01.875 --> 59:02.875
if you could bear it.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.208
I think I can bear it.

59:08.333 --> 59:10.708
He was 34, dark.

59:11.750 --> 59:13.167
He sold copying machines.

59:14.125 --> 59:15.500
He liked jazz, which I loath.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.833
He played squash, danced well,

59:19.125 --> 59:20.708
was generous, remembered birthdays.

59:22.292 --> 59:23.792
Didn't believe in God,

59:24.083 --> 59:25.833
nor unfortunately life insurance.

59:26.917 --> 59:28.292
He was fond of children.

59:28.583 --> 59:29.583
No, none.

59:31.375 --> 59:32.750
Like to stay up late,

59:33.042 --> 59:35.042
unambitious, made you laugh,

59:35.333 --> 59:37.125
worried about growing old,

59:37.417 --> 59:39.542
drove too fast, two
endorsements, will that do?

59:40.708 --> 59:42.083
You must miss him.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.500
I should go back to work.

59:44.750 --> 59:46.583
I may even rent a room.

59:49.458 --> 59:52.292
That wasn't an offer, Mr. Anthony.

1:00:03.667 --> 1:00:04.833
Then again, why not?

1:00:06.625 --> 1:00:07.643
It would save the cost of an advertisement.

1:00:07.667 --> 1:00:08.667
Do you want a room?

1:00:09.875 --> 1:00:11.292
Well, it would hardly be right.

1:00:11.583 --> 1:00:12.583
Why not?

1:00:13.167 --> 1:00:13.833
Well for one thing,

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:15.485
I'd be bound to remind you of him.

1:00:15.542 --> 1:00:19.250
Yes, that's why you can have the room.

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:21.125
Do you want to see it first?

1:00:21.417 --> 1:00:21.958
It's rather messy.

1:00:22.250 --> 1:00:23.250
It was his room.

1:00:24.750 --> 1:00:25.958
His?

1:00:26.250 --> 1:00:28.042
The lock on the door of my own room

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:29.750
is broken by the way.

1:00:30.042 --> 1:00:31.322
I won't bother to have it fixed.

1:00:31.417 --> 1:00:32.417
That means I'm rapeable.

1:00:33.667 --> 1:00:35.542
I don't think you'd enjoy it very much.

1:00:37.583 --> 1:00:38.583
Coming?

1:00:40.833 --> 1:00:42.125
[Male] We regret to announce

1:00:42.417 --> 1:00:44.083
that Flight 335 to London

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:46.167
is unfortunately delayed.

1:00:46.458 --> 1:00:47.000
If you ask me

1:00:47.292 --> 1:00:47.833
I don't.

1:00:48.125 --> 1:00:48.667
I think you want him back.

1:00:48.958 --> 1:00:50.667
You are selfish.

1:00:50.958 --> 1:00:52.750
It's just common humanity, that's all.

1:00:53.042 --> 1:00:54.250
I know Edwin very well.

1:00:55.292 --> 1:00:56.292
He won't be able to cope

1:00:56.458 --> 1:00:57.875
with all that horrid publicity.

1:00:58.167 --> 1:00:58.750
Well he won't have to.

1:00:59.042 --> 1:01:00.242
His name isn't even mentioned.

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:01.875
It will be.

1:01:02.167 --> 1:01:02.792
People are awful.

1:01:03.083 --> 1:01:04.667
Someone's bound to talk.

1:01:04.958 --> 1:01:06.309
I just want to have a clear conscience

1:01:06.333 --> 1:01:07.875
and know that I've done my duty.

1:01:08.167 --> 1:01:11.708
I am still married to him, unfortunately.

1:01:14.208 --> 1:01:18.500
Just think, Edwin the
very first in the whole world.

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:19.792
Hazel,

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:24.375
I have left my wife.

1:01:24.667 --> 1:01:25.917
You wanted to, didn't you?

1:01:38.625 --> 1:01:39.958
Is this the latest batch?

1:01:40.250 --> 1:01:42.500
They're shipping them
from all over the country.

1:01:42.792 --> 1:01:45.542
Men are passing away
with smiles on their faces

1:01:45.833 --> 1:01:49.000
and their wives dancing
up and down with rage.

1:01:49.292 --> 1:01:51.458
Kathleen, you're a genius.

1:01:51.750 --> 1:01:53.542
This opens up whole new vistas.

1:01:53.833 --> 1:01:55.500
There's nothing I can't do now.

1:01:55.792 --> 1:01:57.392
I could re-equip the whole British Navy.

1:01:57.583 --> 1:01:59.042
It's boats they need.

1:02:01.250 --> 1:02:01.958
One of these days,

1:02:02.250 --> 1:02:03.450
you'll do that on top of a bus

1:02:03.542 --> 1:02:04.583
and they'll put you away.

1:02:05.625 --> 1:02:09.542
♪ Every time it rains, it rains ♪

1:02:14.250 --> 1:02:16.875
Verify two and a half.

1:02:17.167 --> 1:02:18.750
[Male] Two and a half, verified.

1:02:19.042 --> 1:02:20.042
Throw it back.

1:02:24.458 --> 1:02:25.708
Hey Rembrandt.

1:02:30.958 --> 1:02:32.625
You're on tele again.

1:02:33.625 --> 1:02:34.625
Oh God.

1:02:36.667 --> 1:02:38.292
Look, can't we go out somewhere?

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:41.708
You and I?

1:02:43.667 --> 1:02:44.792
Well to the pictures.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:47.500
You devil.

1:02:48.292 --> 1:02:49.292
Yes I'd love to.

1:02:50.583 --> 1:02:51.833
How super, thank you.

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:54.667
Well I'll see what's on.

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.083
Did Guy take you to the pictures much?

1:03:04.167 --> 1:03:05.167
Not much.

1:03:05.875 --> 1:03:06.915
Oh, prefer, the theater?

1:03:07.125 --> 1:03:08.125
[Moira] No.

1:03:09.417 --> 1:03:11.458
Probably a little restaurant,

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:13.333
much more romantic anyway,

1:03:14.750 --> 1:03:15.750
and a good film?

1:03:16.042 --> 1:03:18.583
What about, "I Am Curious Yellow"?

1:03:22.875 --> 1:03:25.542
Mrs. Warrington, I don't
mean to be inquisitive

1:03:25.833 --> 1:03:28.458
but your late husband
and I do have a connection.

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:30.500
You had separate rooms.

1:03:30.750 --> 1:03:32.630
If this means that he
was deficient in any way,

1:03:32.750 --> 1:03:33.750
I should be glad to know.

1:03:33.917 --> 1:03:35.625
You see, I don't wish to build up my hopes

1:03:35.917 --> 1:03:37.875
too much for the future, all right?

1:03:41.833 --> 1:03:42.833
All right.

1:03:50.625 --> 1:03:52.833
These are from Guy's girlfriends.

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:53.667
There were more

1:03:53.958 --> 1:03:55.798
but I used them for
lining the butcher's cake.

1:03:56.792 --> 1:03:57.792
Really?

1:03:58.042 --> 1:03:58.750
Well how do you think he fell on me

1:03:59.042 --> 1:04:00.042
with no clothes on?

1:04:00.875 --> 1:04:02.583
I found them in a record Thelonious Monk

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:04.643
so I suppose he thought it
was the last place on Earth

1:04:04.667 --> 1:04:05.667
I'd think of looking.

1:04:06.917 --> 1:04:08.542
Read them.

1:04:08.833 --> 1:04:10.708
They all purr with satisfaction.

1:04:11.833 --> 1:04:12.917
Some French, some German.

1:04:13.208 --> 1:04:14.833
You're a very lucky man

1:04:15.125 --> 1:04:17.625
and headed to the equivalent
of a vintage Rolls-Royce.

1:04:18.792 --> 1:04:19.458
I had no idea.

1:04:19.750 --> 1:04:21.125
Neither had I.

1:04:21.417 --> 1:04:23.750
I mean that, he was quite so versatile.

1:04:24.042 --> 1:04:25.802
There are five women
represented in that lot

1:04:25.833 --> 1:04:27.833
and God knows how many others

1:04:28.125 --> 1:04:30.083
who hadn't the strength left to lift a pen.

1:04:32.333 --> 1:04:35.125
The only one he drew the line
of going to bed with was me.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.125
Very stupid of him.

1:04:42.417 --> 1:04:45.333
He treated me as a Londoner
treats Westminster Abbey.

1:04:45.625 --> 1:04:46.745
He always means to go there,

1:04:46.875 --> 1:04:48.833
but he never quite gets around to it.

1:04:49.125 --> 1:04:51.042
Well, why didn't you get a divorce?

1:04:51.333 --> 1:04:51.875
What for?

1:04:52.167 --> 1:04:54.375
To admit I'd botched
up five years of my life,

1:04:54.667 --> 1:04:56.125
try again and botch up another five?

1:04:56.417 --> 1:04:57.417
No thank you.

1:04:58.167 --> 1:05:00.208
Well, some people can do that, but not me.

1:05:01.417 --> 1:05:03.083
Besides I like this house.

1:05:03.375 --> 1:05:04.495
He wasn't going to move out,

1:05:04.542 --> 1:05:05.875
I was dammed if I was going to.

1:05:07.625 --> 1:05:09.625
Well I'm sure the first
nice man that comes

1:05:09.917 --> 1:05:12.333
I don't believe in nice men, Mr. Anthony.

1:05:13.625 --> 1:05:15.167
If a man is faithful to his wife,

1:05:15.458 --> 1:05:17.167
it means he's queer, impotent

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:19.583
or wearing a frogman's outfit.

1:05:20.667 --> 1:05:22.125
You don't believe that.

1:05:22.417 --> 1:05:23.417
No?

1:05:24.292 --> 1:05:25.917
Well I've never been unfaithful.

1:05:28.667 --> 1:05:30.250
How could you be?

1:05:30.542 --> 1:05:31.083
She fixed you

1:05:31.375 --> 1:05:32.833
long before that chandelier did.

1:05:39.833 --> 1:05:42.375
Are we still going to the pictures?

1:05:42.667 --> 1:05:45.292
(soft rock music)

1:06:14.167 --> 1:06:15.167
Greedy.

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:17.458
Ready?

1:06:17.750 --> 1:06:20.375
(soft rock music)

1:06:33.167 --> 1:06:34.333
I'll ring you, darling.

1:06:37.125 --> 1:06:38.125
Bye.

1:06:43.542 --> 1:06:44.542
Where to now?

1:06:46.083 --> 1:06:47.417
Oy, where to?

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:53.833
I don't know.

1:06:54.125 --> 1:06:56.500
(gentle music)

1:07:17.833 --> 1:07:18.500
After we've eaten,

1:07:18.792 --> 1:07:19.500
I thought perhaps we could
have a drink at the local

1:07:19.792 --> 1:07:20.792
if that's all right.

1:07:23.167 --> 1:07:26.750
Well, you look very fetching.

1:07:27.042 --> 1:07:27.750
Thank you.

1:07:28.042 --> 1:07:29.122
And a drink would be lovely

1:07:29.208 --> 1:07:30.750
but I promised to look in on someone,

1:07:31.042 --> 1:07:33.667
an old friend, lives on his own.

1:07:33.958 --> 1:07:35.083
I feel I've neglected him.

1:07:36.583 --> 1:07:37.583
See you later?

1:07:52.333 --> 1:07:54.292
I do think it was sweet of you to call.

1:07:57.042 --> 1:07:59.292
Well I promised Guy Warrington I'd come.

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:03.667
Hmm, how well did you know him?

1:08:04.750 --> 1:08:05.750
Oh very well.

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:12.208
Yes, you remind me of him.

1:08:12.500 --> 1:08:14.417
Well I have a bit of him about me.

1:08:17.208 --> 1:08:20.375
People grow like their friends.

1:08:20.667 --> 1:08:22.208
Don't you mean like their dogs?

1:08:25.083 --> 1:08:27.667
If I want to discuss
dogs, I'll call a vet.

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:31.083
Fetch me a cushion.

1:08:32.375 --> 1:08:34.792
(suave music)

1:08:52.458 --> 1:08:53.458
Lower.

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:56.000
(suave music)

1:09:00.667 --> 1:09:02.417
I need another one.

1:09:02.708 --> 1:09:05.000
(suave music)

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:16.708
Is that better?

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.417
Mmm, yes much.

1:09:22.292 --> 1:09:23.458
I expect like all men

1:09:23.750 --> 1:09:25.417
you think you're good at making love.

1:09:28.125 --> 1:09:29.333
A gift to learn the women.

1:09:30.875 --> 1:09:35.208
Well, it takes two, don't you agree?

1:09:36.917 --> 1:09:38.042
Why don't you kiss me?

1:09:46.208 --> 1:09:47.208
I like being kissed.

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:57.208
No, no, no, not here.

1:10:08.292 --> 1:10:09.583
Well Percy, my lad,

1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:16.500
oh.

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:21.240
You can come and help me now.

1:10:42.208 --> 1:10:45.125
You must be naked, completely naked.

1:10:46.250 --> 1:10:48.625
Is that absolutely essential?

1:10:48.917 --> 1:10:50.417
Yes, I can't bear it in clothes.

1:10:56.250 --> 1:10:57.250
Shut the window.

1:11:05.208 --> 1:11:08.167
Oh no, no, not the curtains.

1:11:08.458 --> 1:11:09.458
We must have light.

1:11:16.042 --> 1:11:17.042
Naked.

1:11:21.333 --> 1:11:22.542
Completely naked.

1:11:25.417 --> 1:11:27.333
(gasps)

1:11:31.833 --> 1:11:34.125
Why on Earth didn't you tell me?

1:11:34.417 --> 1:11:35.708
How could 1?

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.875
Letting me see it like that,

1:11:38.167 --> 1:11:39.167
all shaven like a monk?

1:11:40.833 --> 1:11:43.167
Look, this is a terrible
thing to do a person,

1:11:43.458 --> 1:11:44.768
lead him on like nobody's business

1:11:44.792 --> 1:11:46.375
and then suddenly throw him out.

1:11:46.667 --> 1:11:47.667
Well, what about me?

1:11:48.667 --> 1:11:50.625
I might have had a heart attack.

1:11:50.917 --> 1:11:52.083
I'm still on the doctors.

1:11:52.375 --> 1:11:53.375
I've got to be careful.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:55.208
We should have pulled the curtains.

1:11:55.500 --> 1:11:58.500
What and having him
jump out at me in the dark?

1:12:02.042 --> 1:12:04.042
Anyway, you haven't
told me how it happened.

1:12:04.333 --> 1:12:05.333
Oh you won't make love,

1:12:05.417 --> 1:12:07.167
but you still want to talk about it?

1:12:07.458 --> 1:12:09.583
I may not cook but I still read recipes.

1:12:11.250 --> 1:12:12.292
How did it happen?

1:12:17.667 --> 1:12:19.500
Oh, I'm the transplant man.

1:12:21.250 --> 1:12:22.250
Oh my God.

1:12:28.958 --> 1:12:30.625
There you are, sir.

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:32.542
They tell me this stuff

1:12:32.833 --> 1:12:34.208
will grow hair on a billiard cue.

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.125
Don't you mean billiard ball, sir?

1:12:36.417 --> 1:12:38.250
Look darling, you
grow it where you want it

1:12:38.542 --> 1:12:40.542
and I'll grow it where
I want it, all right?

1:12:40.833 --> 1:12:43.292
(gentle music)

1:12:46.667 --> 1:12:47.667
Hello?

1:12:48.375 --> 1:12:50.667
Hello, is that the News of the World?

1:12:52.375 --> 1:12:53.375
Good.

1:12:55.292 --> 1:12:58.833
You wish to see me concerning
the late Mr. Guy Warring.

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:00.458
[Edwin] Warrington.

1:13:00.750 --> 1:13:01.833
Warrington.

1:13:02.125 --> 1:13:03.518
Is he one of my husband's constituents?

1:13:03.542 --> 1:13:04.625
If so I

1:13:04.917 --> 1:13:05.917
You wrote him a letter.

1:13:06.667 --> 1:13:08.125
Oh, might I see it?

1:13:08.417 --> 1:13:10.500
I'm afraid it's at home.

1:13:10.792 --> 1:13:13.208
Very well, yes I did know Mr. Warrington.

1:13:13.500 --> 1:13:14.042
He came here once

1:13:14.333 --> 1:13:16.458
to try and sell my husband
a copying machine.

1:13:16.750 --> 1:13:18.333
He pressed his attentions on me

1:13:18.625 --> 1:13:20.250
and naturally I discouraged him.

1:13:20.542 --> 1:13:23.042
I'm married and I love
my husband very much.

1:13:23.333 --> 1:13:25.417
I did write him once,
purely out of kindness,

1:13:25.708 --> 1:13:28.250
but I suppose my letter could
have been misinterpreted.

1:13:29.417 --> 1:13:31.000
You want money I suppose?

1:13:31.292 --> 1:13:32.458
Beg your pardon?

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:33.292
How much do you want?

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:35.792
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not a blackmailer.

1:13:37.125 --> 1:13:38.458
No, I came here because,

1:13:40.333 --> 1:13:43.292
well, because Guy Warrington and I

1:13:43.583 --> 1:13:45.000
may have something in common.

1:13:46.917 --> 1:13:51.833
Look, do you like a spade
to be called a spade?

1:13:52.792 --> 1:13:53.792
Indeed yes.

1:13:53.917 --> 1:13:55.167
No matter what the spade?

1:13:55.458 --> 1:13:57.250
What have spades to do with me?

1:13:57.542 --> 1:13:59.417
It's really only one spade.

1:14:00.333 --> 1:14:01.333
I see.

1:14:03.333 --> 1:14:08.250
Look, every man has a
spade and like fingerprints,

1:14:09.917 --> 1:14:11.083
every spade is different.

1:14:13.667 --> 1:14:14.375
Look, the point is

1:14:14.667 --> 1:14:17.125
would you recognize Guy Warrington spade

1:14:17.417 --> 1:14:18.792
if you were to see it again?

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:23.292
If your spade is what I think it is,

1:14:23.583 --> 1:14:26.083
you're asking you the
most extraordinary question.

1:14:26.375 --> 1:14:27.735
Yes, well, I had no alternative.

1:14:27.875 --> 1:14:30.333
You said you liked to call a spade a spade.

1:14:30.625 --> 1:14:31.958
Yes, of course.

1:14:32.250 --> 1:14:33.250
I quite understand.

1:14:34.542 --> 1:14:36.143
Would you excuse me for a moment, please?

1:14:36.167 --> 1:14:38.417
I have something very
important to attend to.

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.917
Wait here please and do have a drink.

1:14:48.292 --> 1:14:50.875
(phone beeping)

1:15:02.625 --> 1:15:03.625
Hello?

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:04.851
[Female] Would you come upstairs please.

1:15:04.875 --> 1:15:07.542
It's the first door on the left.

1:15:07.833 --> 1:15:08.833
Hello?

1:15:16.333 --> 1:15:18.833
(gentle music)

1:15:37.167 --> 1:15:38.167
(knocking on door)

1:15:38.375 --> 1:15:39.458
Come in.

1:15:39.750 --> 1:15:42.125
(gentle music)

1:15:52.292 --> 1:15:54.792
(upbeat music)

1:16:00.542 --> 1:16:01.708
You wicked man.

1:16:03.667 --> 1:16:04.667
Oh what fun.

1:16:05.583 --> 1:16:07.250
(whipping)

1:16:07.542 --> 1:16:09.833
It's time for your punishment.

1:16:10.750 --> 1:16:12.083
Come here, slave.

1:16:12.375 --> 1:16:13.667
(whipping)

1:16:13.958 --> 1:16:16.333
(upbeat music)

1:16:26.125 --> 1:16:27.667
Oh do come back.

1:16:27.958 --> 1:16:29.583
It's fun, really.

1:16:31.833 --> 1:16:32.833
Had a nice day?

1:16:39.875 --> 1:16:43.792
I stayed up to tell you I shall
need your room, my room.

1:16:44.083 --> 1:16:46.667
I hope a week's notice will be sufficient.

1:16:46.958 --> 1:16:47.958
Goodnight.

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:56.750

1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:56.917
I never guessed he was dead.

1:18:58.792 --> 1:19:01.542
I thought he just moved or got bored.

1:19:02.667 --> 1:19:03.907
Women are more honest that way.

1:19:04.167 --> 1:19:05.625
If they get bored, they say so.

1:19:06.625 --> 1:19:08.583
With men, you just don't see 'em anymore.

1:19:10.292 --> 1:19:11.542
Are you a friend of his?

1:19:11.833 --> 1:19:12.833
In a way.

1:19:13.875 --> 1:19:15.500
Look, are you sure he's dead?

1:19:15.792 --> 1:19:18.083
"Cause I mean I don't fancy
just being handed round

1:19:18.375 --> 1:19:20.208
like I was something second hand.

1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:21.042
Here you are mate,

1:19:21.333 --> 1:19:22.750
hep yourself, I'm done with her.

1:19:23.042 --> 1:19:24.143
No, he died quite suddenly.

1:19:24.167 --> 1:19:25.833
I found a letter you wrote him.

1:19:27.875 --> 1:19:28.875
Did he keep that?

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:35.292
Who would have thought he was soft?

1:19:39.458 --> 1:19:40.875
Are you married?

1:19:43.250 --> 1:19:44.750
Sort of.

1:19:45.042 --> 1:19:46.042
He went off.

1:19:47.333 --> 1:19:50.208
I bet you are married.

1:19:51.625 --> 1:19:52.625
Sort of.

1:19:53.375 --> 1:19:54.375
Same as me.

1:19:58.625 --> 1:19:59.625
Are the pubs open?

1:20:01.208 --> 1:20:02.208
I fancy one.

1:20:03.458 --> 1:20:04.458
All right.

1:20:09.625 --> 1:20:11.625
Did you know Guy was married?

1:20:11.917 --> 1:20:13.542
Course I knew he was married.

1:20:14.583 --> 1:20:17.750
You know, I've got a kid, I work in a cafe.

1:20:19.583 --> 1:20:20.583
Look at them.

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:25.333
It's no oil painting, is it?

1:20:26.917 --> 1:20:28.208
Do you think I fancy myself?

1:20:30.708 --> 1:20:33.167
The single ones are killing
themselves in the rush.

1:20:34.917 --> 1:20:36.750
You're very attractive.

1:20:37.042 --> 1:20:38.708
How much do you want to learn?

1:20:43.083 --> 1:20:46.125
It's making the best of things, isn't it?

1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:50.167
(romantic music)

1:21:12.625 --> 1:21:13.667
[Edwin] That's fine.

1:21:15.667 --> 1:21:16.833
I live over there.

1:21:18.292 --> 1:21:19.292
But you can't come in

1:21:19.500 --> 1:21:21.500
on account of my dad.

1:21:21.792 --> 1:21:23.167
Come on, over here.

1:21:43.792 --> 1:21:44.792
Hurry up.

1:21:55.667 --> 1:21:57.250
We've done all that.

1:22:02.667 --> 1:22:04.083
- Marilyn?
- Mmhmm.

1:22:04.375 --> 1:22:05.667
You don't have to, you know?

1:22:07.583 --> 1:22:09.042
Why not?

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:11.125
You took me out, bought me drinks,

1:22:12.083 --> 1:22:13.250
what's the matter with you?

1:22:13.542 --> 1:22:14.667
Well what I mean is,

1:22:14.958 --> 1:22:16.833
I mean you don't know me, I'm a stranger.

1:22:17.833 --> 1:22:18.542
I mean I like you,

1:22:18.833 --> 1:22:19.833
you're great fun,

1:22:21.250 --> 1:22:22.875
and well, I respect you.

1:22:24.583 --> 1:22:26.103
What sort of girl do you think I am?

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:30.250
I can't afford to be respected.

1:22:32.375 --> 1:22:34.015
I suppose this isn't good enough for you.

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:34.875
No.

1:22:35.167 --> 1:22:36.807
I thought that you might turn out to be

1:22:37.625 --> 1:22:40.250
kind, well-mannered like he was.

1:22:40.542 --> 1:22:41.875
But you're not like him at all.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:44.583
Don't even know enough

1:22:44.875 --> 1:22:45.417
to get a bit of fun out of life.

1:22:45.708 --> 1:22:47.792
Just wait until we
know each other better.

1:22:52.625 --> 1:22:53.625
I don't have time.

1:22:58.875 --> 1:23:01.708
It's all right for some, isn't it?

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:03.750
No wonder your wife left you.

1:23:04.833 --> 1:23:06.000
I feel sorry for her,

1:23:07.833 --> 1:23:08.917
toffee nosed git.

1:23:11.792 --> 1:23:13.208
[Edwin] Marilyn!

1:23:16.208 --> 1:23:17.250
Marilyn!

1:23:17.542 --> 1:23:19.917
(upbeat music)

1:23:35.125 --> 1:23:37.792
(dramatic music)

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:49.042
Had an exhausting night then?

1:23:49.333 --> 1:23:50.934
I'm surprised you didn't fly
straight home to your wife.

1:23:50.958 --> 1:23:52.833
Not exactly the retiring sort, is she?

1:23:54.042 --> 1:23:55.393
Or perhaps you wanted to work your way

1:23:55.417 --> 1:23:56.833
through those addresses first.

1:24:05.083 --> 1:24:06.250
I met a girl yesterday.

1:24:08.167 --> 1:24:09.333
One called Marilyn.

1:24:09.625 --> 1:24:11.583
A lady who spells loving with a.

1:24:13.667 --> 1:24:14.708
I found out something.

1:24:17.458 --> 1:24:20.833
There is no point in making love to someone

1:24:22.542 --> 1:24:24.500
unless you really care about them.

1:24:26.958 --> 1:24:27.958
Wouldn't she then?

1:24:30.083 --> 1:24:31.833
I didn't want to, I liked her.

1:24:32.833 --> 1:24:35.333
Treating women as
human, that'll never do.

1:24:35.625 --> 1:24:36.684
You want to get your skates on,

1:24:36.708 --> 1:24:37.748
they know who you are now,

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:38.625
they're all after you.

1:24:38.917 --> 1:24:41.458
So much to do so little time.

1:24:41.750 --> 1:24:42.750
Who's next then?

1:24:43.917 --> 1:24:46.583
There doesn't have to be
anyone Moira, if you say so.

1:24:49.250 --> 1:24:50.292
I'm not your keeper.

1:24:51.667 --> 1:24:52.667
Try your wife.

1:25:01.875 --> 1:25:04.667
(glass breaking)

1:25:04.958 --> 1:25:06.476
Mrs. Anthony, do you think your husband

1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:07.833
may be suffering from amnesia?

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:09.268
Well I can't think of any other reason

1:25:09.292 --> 1:25:11.083
- why he shouldn't be here.
- Hold it, please.

1:25:12.750 --> 1:25:14.833
Just a little, yeah, nice.

1:25:18.917 --> 1:25:20.958
And what's this then?

1:25:21.250 --> 1:25:22.458
Oh, I saw that yesterday.

1:25:22.750 --> 1:25:23.292
Not Edwin's writing,

1:25:23.583 --> 1:25:24.976
it must be a list of
customers or something.

1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.000
Do you mind if I?

1:25:26.208 --> 1:25:27.208
Oh no.

1:25:27.833 --> 1:25:30.917
(upbeat guitar music)

1:25:35.167 --> 1:25:36.750
Oh my God, yes.

1:25:37.958 --> 1:25:39.458
Of course you are.

1:25:39.750 --> 1:25:42.083
I saw your picture in the papers.

1:25:42.375 --> 1:25:43.575
Am I now supposed to touch you

1:25:43.792 --> 1:25:47.042
and say you are the Percy
man and claim my five pounds

1:25:47.333 --> 1:25:51.375
or is the price something more imaginative?

1:25:53.292 --> 1:25:55.833
Funny, you in my flat, hmm.

1:25:56.125 --> 1:25:57.725
You know you must give me your autograph

1:25:57.917 --> 1:26:00.083
or your thumbprint or something.

1:26:00.375 --> 1:26:01.833
Mrs. Rogers, could we talk?

1:26:02.125 --> 1:26:04.333
Of course, anything, everything,

1:26:04.625 --> 1:26:08.083
a cigarette, a drink, a half
a dozen oysters, anything.

1:26:08.375 --> 1:26:09.917
Oh, I'm so excited.

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:11.917
Oh, we must celebrate,

1:26:12.208 --> 1:26:15.292
crack a bottle of champagne
over it or something.

1:26:15.583 --> 1:26:16.875
Oh no, no scotch, please.

1:26:17.167 --> 1:26:18.167
Scotch it is then.

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.042
Mrs. Rogers.

1:26:20.333 --> 1:26:20.875
Hmm?

1:26:21.167 --> 1:26:25.083
You see the reason that
I'm here is to do with the donor.

1:26:25.375 --> 1:26:27.542
The donor, oh you mean of your hmm?

1:26:27.833 --> 1:26:28.833
(gasps)

1:26:28.917 --> 1:26:30.333
My husband?

1:26:31.667 --> 1:26:32.934
Well, of course, he
always leaves his umbrella

1:26:32.958 --> 1:26:34.083
on trains too.

1:26:34.375 --> 1:26:34.917
No, no, no, no, it's

1:26:35.208 --> 1:26:36.434
And that's the reason why I haven't seen

1:26:36.458 --> 1:26:37.458
so much of him lately.

1:26:37.542 --> 1:26:39.458
Scared to come back without it, no?

1:26:39.750 --> 1:26:43.083
No, it belonged to Guy Warrington.

1:26:44.417 --> 1:26:47.417
Guy, Guy!

1:26:47.708 --> 1:26:50.875
Oh well, do you know what Guy always said?

1:26:51.167 --> 1:26:52.583
He always said when he ever died

1:26:52.875 --> 1:26:54.417
they'd have to beat it to death.

1:26:56.750 --> 1:26:58.167
And now you've got it?

1:26:58.458 --> 1:26:59.458
Yes.

1:27:00.708 --> 1:27:01.375
Oh come and sit here.

1:27:01.667 --> 1:27:03.708
Come and sit here, yeah yes, happy days.

1:27:04.875 --> 1:27:07.042
How well did you know him?

1:27:07.333 --> 1:27:08.750
Very well.

1:27:09.042 --> 1:27:10.042
Didn't they tell you?

1:27:10.333 --> 1:27:11.875
It all happened right here.

1:27:12.167 --> 1:27:13.583
You see Charles, my husband,

1:27:13.875 --> 1:27:17.125
came in through that door and
Guy went out of that window.

1:27:17.417 --> 1:27:18.625
That was terrible, wasn't it?

1:27:18.917 --> 1:27:20.167
Poor lad.

1:27:20.458 --> 1:27:21.518
Oh, your husband found him?

1:27:21.542 --> 1:27:22.782
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

1:27:22.917 --> 1:27:23.500
He's in Sheffield.

1:27:23.792 --> 1:27:24.833
Sit down, come on.

1:27:25.917 --> 1:27:27.500
Well, I think it is rather terrible

1:27:27.792 --> 1:27:29.917
for a man to die without
clothes on, you know?

1:27:30.833 --> 1:27:33.750
Of course, we women, we are different.

1:27:34.042 --> 1:27:35.917
We always like to look our best.

1:27:36.208 --> 1:27:37.208
Don't you agree?

1:27:37.417 --> 1:27:38.417
Mmm.

1:27:38.667 --> 1:27:41.708
So what did you want to talk to me about?

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:43.000
Well, you see, I,

1:27:43.792 --> 1:27:45.292
I came here to see you because

1:27:45.583 --> 1:27:47.208
Mm, well you can do just that.

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:50.000
I think that would be
quite easy, yes, mmhmm.

1:27:50.292 --> 1:27:53.542
Just imagine the first of the few

1:27:53.833 --> 1:27:56.333
and I've got it right in my living room.

1:27:56.625 --> 1:27:59.958
Oh yes.

1:28:01.167 --> 1:28:02.167
Come on, I'm sorry.

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:03.417
I apologize.

1:28:03.708 --> 1:28:05.542
I didn't intend to intrude on you privacy.

1:28:05.833 --> 1:28:08.292
All we wanted was a story, Mrs. Hyde.

1:28:08.583 --> 1:28:09.601
Why can't you stop hounding him,

1:28:09.625 --> 1:28:10.625
you inquisitive bleeders?

1:28:10.917 --> 1:28:12.042
I don't know where he is

1:28:12.333 --> 1:28:14.958
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1:28:17.833 --> 1:28:19.458
Now close the door darling

1:28:19.750 --> 1:28:21.708
or are you some kind of fetishist.

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000
Yes.

1:28:23.708 --> 1:28:26.875
(Spanish guitar music)

1:28:32.625 --> 1:28:34.000
That's it darling, take it off

1:28:34.292 --> 1:28:35.292
and hurry up.

1:28:36.167 --> 1:28:37.417
Come on darling.

1:28:38.542 --> 1:28:40.292
Darling, take off your trousers.

1:28:40.583 --> 1:28:41.583
We are not formal here.

1:28:43.167 --> 1:28:44.167
Ah yes.

1:28:44.875 --> 1:28:46.958
(moaning)

1:28:50.125 --> 1:28:53.000
You know, I'm only doing
this for sentimental reasons,

1:28:53.292 --> 1:28:55.625
putting up a monument to Guy.

1:28:59.417 --> 1:29:01.333
(banging on door)

1:29:01.625 --> 1:29:02.625
What was that?

1:29:04.458 --> 1:29:06.417
Oh my God, it's Charles, it's Charles.

1:29:06.708 --> 1:29:09.000
And he promised he'd go to Sheffield, men.

1:29:10.167 --> 1:29:11.167
[Charles] Helga!

1:29:12.083 --> 1:29:14.208
Yes, sweetheart, yes my darling?

1:29:14.500 --> 1:29:16.083
[Charles] Helga, open the door.

1:29:16.375 --> 1:29:18.042
- Come on, Helga.
- Hurry up.

1:29:18.333 --> 1:29:19.533
You haven't got time for that.

1:29:19.708 --> 1:29:20.250
Where?

1:29:20.542 --> 1:29:21.083
There.

1:29:21.375 --> 1:29:21.917
[Charles] Helga, hurry up.

1:29:22.208 --> 1:29:22.917
Open this door.

1:29:23.208 --> 1:29:24.208
Helga.

1:29:26.208 --> 1:29:26.875
What?

1:29:27.167 --> 1:29:30.125
I've asked him 100
times to buy a bungalow.

1:29:30.417 --> 1:29:31.708
[Charles] Helga!

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.583
(pounding on door)

1:29:33.875 --> 1:29:36.667
(mysterious music)

1:30:28.250 --> 1:30:29.250
Excuse me.

1:30:31.625 --> 1:30:32.625
Hilda.

1:30:34.333 --> 1:30:35.750
Yes dear, is anything wrong?

1:30:48.458 --> 1:30:51.042
(phone ringing)

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.375
Hello?

1:30:53.667 --> 1:30:54.792
[Edwin] Hello, Moira?

1:30:55.083 --> 1:30:56.333
Yes, what is it?

1:30:56.625 --> 1:30:58.833
I've just about had enough of you.

1:30:59.125 --> 1:31:00.208
You married the wrong man

1:31:01.333 --> 1:31:03.333
and now you're too much
of a coward to try again.

1:31:03.625 --> 1:31:04.809
Well you're a fine one to talk.

1:31:04.833 --> 1:31:05.833
Shut up!

1:31:07.417 --> 1:31:09.292
I discovered something today.

1:31:09.583 --> 1:31:11.792
I'm not cut out to be a philanderer.

1:31:12.083 --> 1:31:13.083
Oh, I like women,

1:31:13.375 --> 1:31:15.625
but I don't have the
constitution for more than one.

1:31:15.917 --> 1:31:17.167
Nor a head for heights.

1:31:17.458 --> 1:31:19.018
So you've just better make up your mind

1:31:19.083 --> 1:31:20.083
what it is you want,

1:31:20.375 --> 1:31:22.055
either to go on feeling sorry for yourself

1:31:22.333 --> 1:31:24.708
or take what you're being bloody offered.

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.167
Better come home.

1:31:26.458 --> 1:31:27.458
I've tried.

1:31:48.417 --> 1:31:51.167
Hang on, I'll get some money.

1:31:51.458 --> 1:31:54.542
Oh darling, I've been so worried.

1:31:54.833 --> 1:31:57.042
I don't know how to tell you.

1:31:58.333 --> 1:32:00.093
[Reporter] Hold that
kiss, please, please.

1:32:00.208 --> 1:32:02.167
One more, that's it, just
one more, more, more.

1:32:02.458 --> 1:32:04.667
One for the family album.

1:32:04.958 --> 1:32:06.333
They want you back in hospital.

1:32:06.625 --> 1:32:07.250
They phoned this morning.

1:32:07.542 --> 1:32:09.208
They think they've got to operate again.

1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:10.500
Operate?

1:32:10.583 --> 1:32:12.226
[Reporter] I wonder if you could tell me

1:32:12.250 --> 1:32:17.042
a bit about this operation.

1:32:28.500 --> 1:32:30.140
Now what's all this about the hospital?

1:32:30.208 --> 1:32:31.568
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

1:32:31.625 --> 1:32:33.542
Just a minor adjustment they have to make.

1:32:33.833 --> 1:32:35.083
And I'll be with you this time.

1:32:35.375 --> 1:32:37.458
Yes, but what kind of minor adjustment?

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:39.550
Edwin, you know I'm
not technically minded.

1:32:39.625 --> 1:32:41.167
Mr. Whitbread will explain it all

1:32:41.458 --> 1:32:44.125
and the ambulance is
coming for you at seven.

1:32:44.417 --> 1:32:44.958
Yes, well I'm not going,

1:32:45.250 --> 1:32:45.792
there's nothing wrong with it.

1:32:46.083 --> 1:32:48.125
Oh please darling, for my sake.

1:32:48.417 --> 1:32:50.083
Everything's going to be fine again,

1:32:50.375 --> 1:32:51.417
just like it used to be.

1:32:52.792 --> 1:32:54.083
Could you stop here please?

1:32:55.042 --> 1:32:56.042
Where are you going?

1:32:56.250 --> 1:32:57.250
Hairdresser's.

1:32:57.333 --> 1:32:58.333
I'll only be an hour.

1:32:59.583 --> 1:33:00.583
See you at home.

1:33:18.625 --> 1:33:21.208
(women yelling)

1:33:27.208 --> 1:33:29.708
(gentle music)

Could you survive that?

1:34:14.792 --> 1:34:16.083
I don't think we could.

Men think I'm having the time of my life.

Women look at me

Look here, Whitbread,

1:35:56.750 --> 1:36:00.625
I'm not going on another of
your genital mystery tours.

1:36:00.917 --> 1:36:02.117
I want to know what's going on

1:36:02.167 --> 1:36:04.042
before you touch one hair of my head.

1:36:04.333 --> 1:36:07.208
Knowing you, I'm liable
to wake up this time

1:36:07.500 --> 1:36:09.708
and find I'm the only
man in the world with two

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.167
or one of each or something.

1:36:11.458 --> 1:36:13.218
Yes, well this time
you won't be waking up

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:16.417
because this time you won't
be going to sleep because

Edwin Anthony, Britain's first transplant,

1:36:19.458 --> 1:36:21.083
the man most people want to meet,

1:36:22.542 --> 1:36:25.042
meet the people.

1:36:25.333 --> 1:36:28.292
(audience applauding)

1:36:44.417 --> 1:36:46.667
Well we all know this is a
big surprise to you, Edwin,

1:36:46.958 --> 1:36:49.792
but now you're a part of
history, but not to worry tonight,

1:36:50.083 --> 1:36:51.958
you're surrounded by friends and admirers.

1:36:52.250 --> 1:36:53.542
So give him a big hand, folks.

1:36:56.125 --> 1:36:57.125
No.

1:36:57.292 --> 1:37:00.042
(audience applauding)

1:37:00.333 --> 1:37:03.542
But first, the little woman
who has stood by you

1:37:03.833 --> 1:37:05.125
in your time of trial.

1:37:05.417 --> 1:37:08.167
The woman whose faith
has meant so much to you,

1:37:08.458 --> 1:37:11.375
your wife, Hazel Anthony.

1:37:11.667 --> 1:37:14.125
(upbeat music)

1:37:14.417 --> 1:37:16.625
I'm sorry about the
little white lie, darling.

1:37:16.917 --> 1:37:18.167
Yes, well Mrs. Anthony,

1:37:18.458 --> 1:37:20.292
I'm sure we'd all like to know

1:37:20.583 --> 1:37:22.792
what was your first reaction

1:37:23.083 --> 1:37:27.792
to the news of your husband's transplant?

1:37:28.083 --> 1:37:29.958
I was very proud.

1:37:30.250 --> 1:37:31.768
The truth is she didn't have
much to do with the old one

1:37:31.792 --> 1:37:34.292
so a new one wouldn't make
much difference, would it?

1:37:34.583 --> 1:37:37.375
(audience laughing)

1:37:38.833 --> 1:37:39.500
You know what they say?

1:37:39.792 --> 1:37:42.625
It takes humor to keep a marriage together.

1:37:42.917 --> 1:37:45.208
It's greed that keeps
ours together, hers.

1:37:46.542 --> 1:37:47.601
I'll never forgive you for this.

1:37:47.625 --> 1:37:51.750
Well he certainly didn't
lose his wit in that hospital?

1:37:52.708 --> 1:37:53.708
And now here's a man

1:37:53.833 --> 1:37:56.000
who can vouch for that wit in the old days.

1:37:56.292 --> 1:37:58.143
[James] Still flogging
the nations' heritage,

1:37:58.167 --> 1:37:58.833

1:37:59.125 --> 1:38:03.458
Come in, Ace television
director, James Vaile.

1:38:03.750 --> 1:38:07.042

1:38:07.333 --> 1:38:08.333
Excuse me, thanks.

1:38:09.625 --> 1:38:10.958
Hi.

1:38:11.250 --> 1:38:15.000
Eddie, it's wonderful to see you.

1:38:15.292 --> 1:38:17.583
Well he certainly looks in the pink,

1:38:17.875 --> 1:38:19.315
at least what I can see of him does.

1:38:20.542 --> 1:38:24.833
Well now James, you've known
this famous man for how long?

1:38:25.125 --> 1:38:26.458
Four years, isn't it, squire?

1:38:27.458 --> 1:38:29.500
Yes, ever since his lovely wife became my

1:38:31.125 --> 1:38:32.542
very able assistant.

1:38:32.833 --> 1:38:33.375
I see.

1:38:33.667 --> 1:38:35.958
And it was then that you
and he became close friends?

1:38:36.250 --> 1:38:37.250
Close friends?

1:38:37.292 --> 1:38:39.212
The squire and I are
like that, aren't we Eddie?

1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:40.660
All those wonderful evenings.

1:38:40.875 --> 1:38:43.000
Yes, I used to be in
and out there all the time.

1:38:43.292 --> 1:38:44.667
Wasn't I, Eddie?

1:38:44.958 --> 1:38:46.042
(laughing)

1:38:46.333 --> 1:38:47.000
[Hazel] Edwin!

1:38:47.292 --> 1:38:49.750
(country music)

1:38:56.333 --> 1:38:58.667
I've only had one casualty.

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.708
Are you all right, Georgie?

1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:06.542
Am I all right?

1:39:06.833 --> 1:39:07.500
I'm a ruined man.

1:39:07.792 --> 1:39:10.250
(country music)

1:39:12.833 --> 1:39:14.958
Now you get yourself a new one.

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.542
was the latest triumph of
British transplant technique.

1:39:43.250 --> 1:39:45.125

international acclaim

1:39:49.917 --> 1:39:51.434

recent and famous patient,

Mr. John, formerly, Miss Joanna Elder

1:40:00.167 --> 1:40:01.167
and his lovely bride,

1:40:02.042 --> 1:40:04.792
the former dancer, Rita La Rousse.

1:40:10.167 --> 1:40:12.625
[Reporter] Do you think
this will be a lasting thing.

1:40:12.917 --> 1:40:14.208
Joanna.

1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:16.042
Joanna, welcome home.

1:40:17.083 --> 1:40:19.167
They beat us to it.

1:40:19.458 --> 1:40:22.583
Oh it was you who insisted
we waited for the divorce.

1:40:22.875 --> 1:40:24.275
I didn't want the Queen's product
