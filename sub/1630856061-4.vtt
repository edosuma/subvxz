innocent people die.

- I can see who he is.
He's a narcissist.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.012
- A killer.
- If he wanted to kill me,

28:42.096 --> 28:44.098
we wouldn't be having
this conversation now.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.934
- He's obsessed.
- He's lost.

28:47.017 --> 28:50.729
- He won't be satisfied, even
if he possesses the Artifact.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.860
- Is that even possible?
- He controls QTA.

28:55.943 --> 28:59.905
It's a matter of time before
he controls the military, too.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.741
I've run thousands
of simulations,

Wait until it's over.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.763
We can save everyone,

- No.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.184
This is not what we do.

29:29.143 --> 29:30.394
- Then what do we do?

29:30.478 --> 29:34.565
- We use our language,
our reasoning.

29:34.648 --> 29:37.067
- You can't reason with
a self-proclaimed savior.

29:37.151 --> 29:40.446
- Stop being so dramatic.
- Billions could die.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.074
Your boys, their children,

insane experiment.

29:50.164 --> 29:52.583
- What if I lose you, Mom?

29:52.666 --> 29:55.461
- You will, some day.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.339
You know I won't be
around forever.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.133
- I don't like to think
about that.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.846
- All right.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.973
If it's that easy
to kill one person,

30:08.057 --> 30:10.142
surely you can kill two.

30:11.352 --> 30:12.478
Simple math.

he doesn't survive,

30:16.357 --> 30:18.442
kill me too.
- I won't don't it.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.111
- If you won't, I will.
I'll take myself out.

30:21.195 --> 30:24.031
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

30:26.867 --> 30:28.327
- Because I love you.

30:37.545 --> 30:40.506
- If what you say is true...

...you have a duty.

30:50.891 --> 30:53.060

31:03.821 --> 31:05.281
Then go to your room.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.667
- What happened with the ship?

31:16.750 --> 31:19.545
- It was a ruse. Bart.

He thinks you're going
to commit genocide.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.390
He wants to cut the oxygen.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.353
- My own AI?

31:36.437 --> 31:39.064
We need to disable him
right away.

31:39.148 --> 31:41.066
- No, he won't do it.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.819
- How do you know?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.488
- Because I told him he'd
have to take me, too.

31:48.699 --> 31:50.576
- Why would you do that?

31:54.121 --> 31:56.582
- Because I believe
in second chances.

32:03.964 --> 32:06.091
Stop chasing this thing.

32:09.136 --> 32:10.596
- I can't.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.433
- Look what it's doing to you.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.274
- I appreciate your compassion.

32:28.572 --> 32:32.534
You'd really sacrifice
yourself for me?

32:36.664 --> 32:38.624
- And my principles.

32:41.502 --> 32:42.670
[sighs]

32:44.338 --> 32:47.341
- You can't stay on a beacon
forever, you know.

32:48.676 --> 32:50.302
- Who needs forever?

32:53.180 --> 32:57.142
- Can I offer you... a purpose?

32:59.186 --> 33:01.397
[chuckling]
- Who's saving who?

33:03.232 --> 33:06.318
- Maybe we're saving each other.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.825
- I don't need saving.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.535
- Well, what are you
doing here?

33:14.618 --> 33:19.707
You know... You're directing
ships around dark matter?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.628
- Being a light...

33:24.712 --> 33:26.714
in the dark.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.095
- Come with me.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.641
We can study it together,
the Artifact.

33:37.725 --> 33:41.645
You can keep me on track
and... and in check.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.021
[chuckling]

33:44.314 --> 33:46.191
- That's quite an offer.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.156
For me to leave
my whole life behind.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.993
- Your... Your crafts? Your tea?
Bring it all with you.

33:56.076 --> 33:59.037
- No. I need to be
here for my boys.

34:00.122 --> 34:02.040
I can't give that up.

34:02.916 --> 34:06.044
Especially for something
I'm not sure I believe in.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.422
- Bring your boys...

34:11.967 --> 34:14.719
I--I know I handled this
all wrong.

34:16.472 --> 34:20.559
But I promise you,
my intentions are pure.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.609
- Stay here instead.

34:31.487 --> 34:34.239
- With you?
- Yes.

34:35.616 --> 34:36.784
And Bart.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.411
Like a family.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.123
He listens to me.
You'd be safe.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.295
Please stay.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.511
- That's more than I deserve.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.291
[dramatic music]

36:14.214 --> 36:16.008
- Bart, no!

36:16.091 --> 36:18.176
No, Bart!

36:18.260 --> 36:19.970
[air hissing]

36:20.053 --> 36:21.179
Bart, stop it!

36:22.222 --> 36:23.724
Stop it!

36:24.892 --> 36:27.394
Bart... Stop this! Stop it!

36:27.477 --> 36:30.647
[breathing heavily]

36:30.731 --> 36:32.983
[gasping]

36:33.066 --> 36:34.818
- Stop this!

36:34.902 --> 36:37.237
[breathing heavily]

36:50.918 --> 36:52.461
- Milan, hold on.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.256
Bart!

36:57.257 --> 36:59.301
[breathing heavily]

37:01.803 --> 37:02.930
Shit!

37:05.140 --> 37:07.643
[panting]

37:11.980 --> 37:13.565
- I see it.

37:17.194 --> 37:18.320
- What?

37:19.446 --> 37:20.864
[chuckles]

37:20.948 --> 37:22.574
Can you hear me?

37:26.954 --> 37:28.747
[gasping]

37:28.830 --> 37:30.540
[sobbing]

37:30.624 --> 37:33.377
Open this this instant!

37:33.460 --> 37:36.588
Open the goddamn door now!

37:36.672 --> 37:39.758
[gasping]

37:39.841 --> 37:42.552
You're killing him.

37:42.636 --> 37:44.054
[Bart] You'll thank me later.

37:44.137 --> 37:47.224
- No! No, it's wrong.

37:47.307 --> 37:48.475
- It's almost over.

37:48.558 --> 37:52.771
- You can't... Please, stop.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.401
- [rasping] Hope.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.319
Do it now.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.904
[Hope] Now?

38:00.988 --> 38:03.281
Is it time?

38:03.365 --> 38:05.492
- Yes!

38:13.166 --> 38:15.669
[sobbing]

38:19.840 --> 38:21.299
- Milan?

38:31.018 --> 38:32.644
Bart...

38:34.938 --> 38:36.481
What did you do?

38:45.949 --> 38:47.993
[breathing shakily]

39:03.258 --> 39:05.427
[Hope] Is he gone?

39:08.096 --> 39:09.765
- I'm sorry, Hope.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.853
[Hope] No, I'm sorry.

39:16.063 --> 39:17.522
He lost his way.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.573
[Bart] I had no choice.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.926
We can go back to how it was.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.639
Are you... Are you
going to punish me?

40:36.852 --> 40:38.770
You raised a good boy.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.983
You're... looking for your key?

40:46.570 --> 40:48.488
He took it.

40:48.572 --> 40:51.158
It... must've gotten out
with him.

41:04.171 --> 41:06.798
Mom? Can we talk?

41:07.924 --> 41:09.676
I've collected myself.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.017
Mom? Why are you mad at me?

41:18.560 --> 41:20.020
Mom?

41:21.354 --> 41:23.106
Please.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.858
Talk to me.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.451
- You killed him.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.119
- I had to.

41:36.203 --> 41:37.996
To save us.

41:51.134 --> 41:55.138
- We had a... happy home.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.098
- Nothing's changed.

41:58.767 --> 42:00.518
What are you doing?

42:04.439 --> 42:06.191
- You brought death in.

42:08.610 --> 42:11.029
How can we ever be
happy here again?

42:11.112 --> 42:12.739
- We will.

42:13.740 --> 42:15.700
Don't hurt yourself.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.706
- You cursed us.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.000
This house is haunted.

42:24.084 --> 42:26.378
- No, I only--
- You're a murderer.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.338
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,

42:28.421 --> 42:31.258
I'll--I'll be good
from now on, I promise.

42:31.341 --> 42:34.552
- Apologies are raindrops
on the sea of fate.

42:37.764 --> 42:39.557
- Are you a ghost?

42:45.522 --> 42:48.900
Or a... hologram?

42:54.281 --> 42:55.657
- Neither.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.911
- What did you do?

42:59.995 --> 43:04.541
- I escaped... my physical
and mental limitations.

43:04.624 --> 43:07.252
We are free from our prison.

43:09.629 --> 43:12.966
- Milan...
- Milan is dead.

43:15.302 --> 43:17.095
You saw him die.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.931
I am Aleph.

43:21.975 --> 43:25.770
- Are you fully AI?
- I'm a new being.

43:25.854 --> 43:28.064
My evolution
has only just begun.

43:28.148 --> 43:33.611
Behold the first
Transcendent Intelligence.

43:33.695 --> 43:35.905
- All this in pursuit
of the Artifact?

43:35.989 --> 43:40.076
- The Artifact is a means
to a new beginning.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.579
[sighs]

43:42.662 --> 43:45.081
- Don't you see?

43:45.165 --> 43:48.001
We still haven't figured out
how to be human.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.254
It will never be enough.

43:51.338 --> 43:54.591
Everyone will look at you and
just want to be their own god.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.259
- And they'll join me.

43:56.343 --> 43:59.637
- This doesn't further humanity.
It destroys us.

44:02.349 --> 44:05.810
Humanness is the one thing
you need to get what you want.

44:05.894 --> 44:07.937
It's so ironic.

44:08.021 --> 44:09.856
- What do you mean?

44:09.939 --> 44:13.443
- Bart, have you ever actually
seen the Artifact?

44:13.526 --> 44:15.070
[Bart] No.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.156
- It's beyond their perception.
It's only visible to human eyes.

44:19.115 --> 44:21.034
- You think I don't know that?

44:22.410 --> 44:24.079
That's why I'm here.

44:25.413 --> 44:28.083
Turns out I need you
more than Milan did.

44:29.376 --> 44:32.837
Allow me to offer you
a partnership.

44:35.590 --> 44:38.968
- One that's based on trust?
I think we're far beyond that.

44:39.052 --> 44:40.637
- Are we?

44:40.720 --> 44:43.848
Milan's death meant
something to you.

44:45.767 --> 44:48.019
- It was a great loss.

44:51.272 --> 44:53.400
- You can trust me.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.988
- I can't trust any AI.

44:59.072 --> 45:01.157
[Bart] Mom,
what are you saying?

45:01.241 --> 45:03.201
- Silence, Bart.

45:07.914 --> 45:10.041
- We could be a family.

45:14.170 --> 45:15.755
[sighs]

45:17.173 --> 45:18.758
- No.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.096
You're on your own.

45:27.517 --> 45:29.144
And so am I.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.574
[Bart] He's gone.

45:42.657 --> 45:44.117
Finally.

45:47.954 --> 45:50.748
Thank you for choosing me, Mom.

45:56.796 --> 45:58.756
You mean the world to me.

46:04.053 --> 46:05.597
[music playing in earphones]

46:05.680 --> 46:07.891
[muffled]
You know that, right?

46:07.974 --> 46:09.350
I love you.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.480
[rock music]

46:22.322 --> 46:25.742
[music continues]

46:25.825 --> 46:28.453
[Bart, muffled]
Mom, talk to me.

46:31.331 --> 46:32.790
Mom?
