WEBVTT

01:22.599 --> 01:26.534
...serve the Lord, rejoicing
in the power of his Spirit.

01:26.569 --> 01:28.674
And the blessing
of God Almighty,

01:28.709 --> 01:32.402
the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit be upon you

01:32.437 --> 01:35.164
and remain
with you all forever.

01:35.198 --> 01:36.268
Amen.

01:36.303 --> 01:37.856
Amen.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.260
Mm-hmm.

02:12.339 --> 02:13.857
They'’re coming. Look.

02:26.974 --> 02:29.666
If you could all look
this way, please.

02:37.605 --> 02:40.332
I have never seen
a wedding like it.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.714
It'’s a bit grander than ours.

02:43.715 --> 02:45.855
There you are.

02:49.548 --> 02:52.724
I haven'’t noticed
any congratulations
on your lips.

02:52.758 --> 02:53.932
Mm.Don'’t tease him.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.761
I wish the boy well.

02:55.796 --> 02:57.315
I do.Oh.

02:59.351 --> 03:00.973
Very smart.

03:03.562 --> 03:05.254
Ah, Mary.Hello.

03:05.288 --> 03:06.979
Darling,
have you seen the cake?It'’s beautiful.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.328
All smile.

03:13.538 --> 03:14.608
It'’s delightful.

03:14.642 --> 03:15.747
Be careful, children.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.338
Oh.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.722
Thank you.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.242
They'’re going to live here.

03:28.277 --> 03:30.279
And I'’m off
to the dower house.

03:30.313 --> 03:32.971
The thought of being warm
in winter goes to my head
like strong drink.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.731
I can imagine.

03:34.766 --> 03:36.630
We'’re going to
cut the cake.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.908
I want to thank you
for allowing me
to be so happy.

03:38.942 --> 03:41.842
I feel like I'’ve been given
much more than I deserve.

03:42.912 --> 03:46.053
Well, that'’s
an encouraging start.

03:50.816 --> 03:53.750
Bravo.

04:01.862 --> 04:03.933
Splendid.
Size of that cake.

04:10.077 --> 04:11.561
Goodbye.Send us a postcard.

04:11.596 --> 04:12.873
Thank you for everything.Bye, old boy.

04:12.907 --> 04:14.288
Bye-bye.Have a wonderful time.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.048
Have a safe journey.We will.

04:22.710 --> 04:23.918
Bye.

04:24.954 --> 04:26.576
Goodbye.

04:27.681 --> 04:28.854
Goodbye.

04:33.721 --> 04:35.827
Congratulations.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.386
I'’ve had a letter
from Mr. Murray.

04:43.421 --> 04:44.836
He'’s coming to Downton
on Tuesday.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.872
What do you want him for?Oh, it wasn'’t me.

04:46.907 --> 04:48.978
It was your grandmother
who summoned him.

04:49.012 --> 04:51.083
He'’d like us there.

04:51.118 --> 04:53.051
Rosamund,
you should be with us.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.571
Oh, dear.Why do you say that?

04:55.605 --> 04:59.091
There'’s only one reason
old ladies summon
their lawyers.

05:25.808 --> 05:27.844
Do sit down.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.985
I feel like Andromeda
chained to a rock

05:31.020 --> 05:32.987
with you lot
hovering over me.

05:33.022 --> 05:35.783
I don'’t know why Murray
told you to be here

05:35.818 --> 05:37.578
without asking me first.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.097
Nor do we.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.857
Ah, Denker.

05:40.892 --> 05:42.411
A Mr. Murray
will be here soon.

05:42.445 --> 05:44.136
H-He'’s here now, milady.

05:44.171 --> 05:46.587
He... He says
you'’re expecting him.

05:46.622 --> 05:48.831
What?
Why didn'’t you tell me?

05:48.865 --> 05:51.143
You shouldn'’t be so untrusting.

05:53.974 --> 05:57.115
Ah, have you told them,
Lady Grantham? Good.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.530
Please.

05:58.565 --> 05:59.911
She'’s told us nothing.

05:59.945 --> 06:01.775
Well, that'’s easily done.

06:01.809 --> 06:05.503
I'’ve come into possession of
a villa in the South of France.

06:05.537 --> 06:09.783
And now I'’ve given it to
my great-granddaughter Sybbie.

06:09.817 --> 06:10.922
What?

06:10.956 --> 06:13.200
What bit didn'’t you understand?

06:13.234 --> 06:15.029
I don'’t understand any of it.

06:15.064 --> 06:16.686
What villa? Where?

06:16.721 --> 06:18.757
This is too extraordinary
for any words.

06:18.792 --> 06:22.071
It'’s called
La Villa des Colombes,
and it'’s near Toulon.

06:22.105 --> 06:23.624
But why was it yours?

06:23.659 --> 06:25.764
And why have you never
said anything about it?

06:25.799 --> 06:27.525
Because I thought it was a joke.

06:27.559 --> 06:30.597
Start at the beginning.

06:30.631 --> 06:35.222
Years ago,
before you were born,
I was in France,

06:35.256 --> 06:38.743
and I met a man,
the Marquis de Montmirail.

06:38.777 --> 06:41.124
And he invited me
to spend some time

06:41.159 --> 06:43.644
at a villa he'’d just bought.

06:43.679 --> 06:46.129
A year or so later,
he wrote to me

06:46.164 --> 06:51.134
and said he'’d transferred
the villa into my name.

06:51.169 --> 06:54.724
I never thought he was serious,
so I didn'’t pay any attention.

06:54.759 --> 06:57.555
But it wasn'’t a joke?It seems not.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.765
He died recently,
and to his widow'’s alarm,

07:00.799 --> 07:03.215
the villa they'’ve been using
every winter for years

07:03.250 --> 07:05.873
was registered
to Lady Grantham.

07:05.908 --> 07:07.496
He never changed it.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.601
Now, I'’ll need
some signatures.Oh, yes.

07:09.636 --> 07:11.707
Why have you
given it to Sybbie?

07:11.741 --> 07:13.812
Your children
are well set up here,

07:13.847 --> 07:16.228
and Edith'’s are more
than taken care of,

07:16.263 --> 07:20.543
but Brompton will go
to a child of Tom and Lucy'’s.

07:20.578 --> 07:23.788
So darling Sybil'’s only daughter
will inherit little,

07:23.822 --> 07:25.755
and I wanted to correct that.

07:25.790 --> 07:29.966
What family did he have, uh,
this M-Montmirail chap?

07:30.001 --> 07:33.142
The widow and a son,
the present marquis.

07:33.176 --> 07:35.972
The mother is keen they should
take the matter to court.

07:36.007 --> 07:37.767
-Well, you can'’t blame her.
-Why?

07:37.802 --> 07:40.287
If her husband wanted me
to have the place,

07:40.321 --> 07:41.633
who are we to argue?

07:41.668 --> 07:43.566
You never thought
to turn it down?

07:43.601 --> 07:48.053
Do I look as if I'’d turn down
a villa in the South of France?

07:50.677 --> 07:51.885
Mr. Murray?

07:54.025 --> 07:56.165
May I ask a favor?Please.

07:56.199 --> 07:59.755
I have a task for you.
It'’s all explained
in this letter.

07:59.789 --> 08:03.137
I'’ll telephone in a few days
in case there are questions.Of course, Lady Grantham.

08:03.172 --> 08:06.175
Now, I hear
my train calling.Goodbye, Mr. Murray.

08:06.209 --> 08:08.004
And thank you.

08:12.077 --> 08:14.908
You want me to tell you
why he did it

08:15.840 --> 08:18.912
when the truth is
I do not know.

08:20.154 --> 08:22.812
And with that,
I will say good night

08:22.847 --> 08:26.851
and leave you to discuss
my mysterious past.

08:26.885 --> 08:30.233
Now, Denker,
don'’t steer me.

08:30.268 --> 08:32.650
I'’m not a racing car.

08:32.684 --> 08:34.237
More'’s the pity.

08:35.722 --> 08:36.861
I beg your pardon.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.828
You really must try...

08:38.863 --> 08:42.349
It does seem odd.
They spend a few days together
in the same resort

08:42.383 --> 08:45.870
more than 60 years ago,
and he gives her a house.

08:45.904 --> 08:47.319
I suppose he wasn'’t
just a lunatic.

08:47.354 --> 08:49.356
Well, that'’s what
they'’ll try to prove.

08:49.390 --> 08:52.255
Well, I think
it'’s marvelous of Granny
to take care of Sybbie.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.810
Even if
Monsieur de Montmirail
was as mad as a rat.

08:54.844 --> 08:56.777
But why did Mama
never say a word?

08:56.812 --> 08:59.987
As far as she'’s concerned,
she received a very
eccentric letter

09:00.022 --> 09:02.024
more than half a century ago.

09:02.058 --> 09:03.991
She considered it potty
at the time

09:04.026 --> 09:06.097
and never gave it
another thought.

09:07.616 --> 09:10.619
Well done, Marigold.Go on.

09:10.653 --> 09:13.794
I think it'’d be wonderful
for them to have...

09:13.829 --> 09:16.279
That'’s right. Good shot.You stand back.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.042
Nanny, watch.

09:20.076 --> 09:22.044
A telephone call
for you, milord.

09:22.078 --> 09:23.839
Who is it?Uh, a Mr. Barber.

09:23.873 --> 09:25.703
Says he'’s from British Lion.What'’s that?

09:25.737 --> 09:27.877
It'’s a film company,
isn'’t it?

09:27.912 --> 09:30.121
I better find out
what he wants.

09:31.432 --> 09:33.918
What will they do
with the villa
in the summer?

09:33.952 --> 09:35.816
They can'’t let it.
Nobody goes there then.

09:35.851 --> 09:37.956
Oh, they do now.Well, surely it'’s too hot.

09:37.991 --> 09:39.130
Apparently not.

09:39.164 --> 09:40.407
Mummy!Hello, darling.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.616
Mummy, come and play!

09:42.651 --> 09:44.825
It'’s a race. Come on. Quickly.

09:50.175 --> 09:51.936
"Good deeds..."

09:51.970 --> 09:55.111
Mr. Barber turns out to be
a producer and director.

09:55.146 --> 09:57.666
He wanted to practice
chronophotography here.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.771
It'’s not the Stone Age, Papa.

09:59.806 --> 10:03.223
You mean he wants
to make a film at Downton?What did you say?

10:03.257 --> 10:05.915
I let him down gently.
Then I'’ll ring him back.

10:05.950 --> 10:08.435
-I want to hear
what he has to offer.
-What'’s the point?

10:08.469 --> 10:10.368
Well, I suppose
there'’d be a fee.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.681
When does Henry get home?Not in time for this.

10:12.715 --> 10:14.130
Where is he now?

10:14.165 --> 10:17.168
His last message was
from Istanbul or somewhere.

10:17.202 --> 10:19.998
But as far as I'’m concerned,
the whole idea of a rally
is barmy.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.206
You can manage it
without him.

10:21.241 --> 10:23.174
I see.
So it'’s down to me, is it?

10:23.208 --> 10:26.073
You can'’t expect us
to deal with kinema people.

10:26.108 --> 10:28.144
First, let'’s just listen
to his proposal.

10:28.179 --> 10:30.250
Hmm.Come along, Mary.
I'’ll keep you company.

10:30.284 --> 10:32.942
The money would
be useful, surely.

10:32.977 --> 10:35.669
Is everything
all right with Henry?

10:35.704 --> 10:37.775
He'’s in love with cars.

10:37.809 --> 10:41.019
He'’s in love with speed.
He'’s in love with adventure.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.366
He'’s also in love with me,
I think.

10:43.401 --> 10:45.921
But I don'’t seem to
cancel out the other three.

10:45.955 --> 10:49.165
And you thought
you would?I suppose I did.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.926
Ready for you.

11:07.390 --> 11:08.806
It'’s perfect.

11:10.083 --> 11:13.120
Until recently,
filmmaking was largely
confined to the studios,

11:13.155 --> 11:15.226
but now the process
has opened up.

11:15.260 --> 11:17.815
Abel Gance'’s Napoléonlast year

11:17.849 --> 11:19.920
showed what a camera
can do on location,

11:19.955 --> 11:21.750
filming in real houses,
real landscapes.

11:21.784 --> 11:23.510
What sort of film is it?

11:23.544 --> 11:26.202
The Gambleris set in 1875.

11:26.237 --> 11:28.964
Uh, an earl'’s daughter,
Lady Anne Erskine,

11:28.998 --> 11:31.829
falls in love with a man
who turns out to be a gambler,

11:31.863 --> 11:34.279
to her family'’s horror.I can imagine.

11:34.314 --> 11:37.800
They meet at a house party
in the country, and things
soon spin out of control.

11:37.835 --> 11:41.045
There are visits
to a smart gambling club,
which we'’d do here.

11:41.079 --> 11:42.943
A gambling club
at Downton?

11:42.978 --> 11:44.393
That would
finish Granny off.

11:44.427 --> 11:46.188
And Papa too.

11:46.222 --> 11:48.500
We must have time
to think.Of course.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.433
Here'’s my card.

11:50.468 --> 11:52.884
Mm-hmm.Ring me if you have
any questions at all.

11:52.919 --> 11:54.852
I'’ll get Barrow
to see you out.

11:54.886 --> 11:57.095
I suppose there are
two questions that we
would need the answer to

11:57.130 --> 11:59.408
before we can really
have the discussion.

11:59.442 --> 12:01.341
Uh, we'’d be here
for about a month,

12:01.375 --> 12:04.447
and if you turn the card over,
you'’ll see what we'd pay.

12:04.482 --> 12:07.002
Of course,
that'’s negotiable.

12:07.036 --> 12:09.107
Goodbye.

12:15.976 --> 12:17.771
And that'’s
the starting point?

12:20.947 --> 12:22.465
I think it'’s a horrible idea.

12:22.500 --> 12:26.504
Actresses plastered in makeup
and actors just plastered,

12:26.538 --> 12:28.264
scrambling over our things.

12:28.299 --> 12:31.060
We'’d have to keep counting
the spoons in the pantry.

12:31.095 --> 12:32.544
The locals
might take a dim view.

12:32.579 --> 12:34.512
Well, you mustn'’t
let that stop you.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.445
The county takes a dim view
of everything.

12:36.479 --> 12:38.102
You have to consider the fee.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.828
We don'’t need
to talk about money.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.553
Oh, but you need
to think about it.

12:41.588 --> 12:43.314
You could have a new roof,
for a start.

12:43.348 --> 12:45.903
You could soon be looking at
real flooding, and then what?

12:45.937 --> 12:50.148
If you turn them down, you think
we could persuade them to drive
further north to Brancaster?

12:51.425 --> 12:53.289
Mama, where do you stand?

12:53.324 --> 12:56.499
Mary, dear,
will you take your father
to see the attics?

12:56.534 --> 12:59.226
I don'’t think he's been there
for quite a while.

13:10.341 --> 13:12.515
I haven'’t been up here
for years.

13:12.550 --> 13:15.139
Well, this is
the situation we'’re in.

13:15.173 --> 13:17.589
With the money, we can bring
the house up to snuff,

13:17.624 --> 13:19.591
to match what we'’ve spent
on the estate,

13:19.626 --> 13:22.491
and enter the 1930s
with our heads held high.

13:22.525 --> 13:25.149
But if you
don'’t want to...No.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.325
No, you steer ahead.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.087
You'’re the captain now.

13:32.121 --> 13:35.987
I am aware of that,
even if you think I'’m not.

13:37.437 --> 13:39.853
And now I have
the unenviable task

13:39.888 --> 13:41.924
of breaking the news
to Mr. Carson.

13:41.959 --> 13:45.410
I can'’t believe it.
To make a film here?
Can they do that?

13:45.445 --> 13:47.171
Would there be film stars?
Famous ones?

13:47.205 --> 13:49.380
Oh, give her some water
before she passes out.

13:49.414 --> 13:51.278
Nothing'’s decided yet.

13:51.313 --> 13:54.074
It'’s all very fine
to get excited.
You live at the farm.

13:54.109 --> 13:56.111
The rest of us will
have them in and out

13:56.145 --> 13:58.527
and round about
every hour God sends.

13:58.561 --> 14:02.117
And what of Her Ladyship?
Hoping for a peaceful end.

14:02.151 --> 14:06.535
And suddenly plunged
into a three-ring circus.Well, I agree with Daisy.

14:06.569 --> 14:09.572
We'’ll get to know men
and women we'’ve only seen
up on the silver screen.

14:09.607 --> 14:11.920
And if it'’s good
for the house...This is the point.

14:11.954 --> 14:15.026
-An injection of cash could
make all the difference.
-They mention how much?

14:15.061 --> 14:17.028
It'’s not our business
if they did.

14:17.063 --> 14:18.961
-They did not.
-Well, good night.

14:18.996 --> 14:20.411
Good night.Good night, Mrs. Hughes.

14:20.445 --> 14:23.690
Still, times change,
and we must change with them.

14:23.724 --> 14:26.175
Mrs. Parker.
We should be getting home too.

14:26.210 --> 14:28.453
Very good, Mr. Parker.
I'’m coming.

14:28.488 --> 14:33.631
Daisy'’s more obedient with him
than she ever was with me.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.460
Maybe he makes her happier.

14:35.495 --> 14:37.566
Well, I did me best.

14:41.294 --> 14:44.021
A moving picture?
At Downton?

14:44.055 --> 14:46.437
I know
it sounds unlikely,

14:46.471 --> 14:49.958
but I'’m not sure
it'’s quite as awful as that.

14:49.992 --> 14:51.200
I disagree.

14:51.235 --> 14:54.100
Rough and vulgar actors
and actresses

14:54.134 --> 14:57.068
strolling through the rooms
with their sticky fingers,

14:57.103 --> 14:58.621
sitting on the chairs,

14:58.656 --> 15:01.417
eating at the table where
the King of England once sat?

15:01.452 --> 15:04.075
Oh, this smacks of
the worst excesses

15:04.110 --> 15:06.112
of the French Revolution.

15:06.146 --> 15:09.184
Should we ask them
to stay standing
and put them in gloves?

15:09.218 --> 15:12.428
This is a comedown, Elsie.
This is a falling-off.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.706
They are flirting
with mob rule.

15:14.741 --> 15:17.986
But it will pay, Charlie,
and they need the money.

15:18.020 --> 15:21.023
Oh, by that argument,
why not open the place
to the public

15:21.058 --> 15:23.646
and have them poke and pry
in every corner?

15:23.681 --> 15:25.234
We tried that once,

15:25.269 --> 15:28.410
and I thought we'’d
all decided never again.

15:30.274 --> 15:33.380
You carry on like that,
you'’ll give yourself
a heart attack.

15:33.415 --> 15:36.487
I'’d be better off out of it
if this is what we'’ve come to.

15:38.454 --> 15:41.664
♪ These moments don'’t happen
So often♪

15:41.699 --> 15:44.357
♪ It doesn'’t seem right♪Hmm.

15:44.391 --> 15:47.118
♪ To delay...♪

15:47.153 --> 15:49.638
Andy, I wonder if you might
fold that newspaper properly?

15:49.672 --> 15:51.191
I'’ll take it upstairs with me.

15:51.226 --> 15:52.710
Course.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.334
So, moving picture
to be made at the big house.

15:56.369 --> 15:58.543
What will that mean
for the pair of you?

15:58.578 --> 16:01.581
Can'’t say exactly.But it'’ll be exciting.

16:01.615 --> 16:04.342
Seeing how a film'’s made,
meeting the stars.

16:04.377 --> 16:06.379
I'’d keep clear of them
if I were you.

16:06.413 --> 16:07.690
Keep clear of all of it.

16:08.588 --> 16:09.658
I'’ll say good night,
then.

16:09.692 --> 16:12.109
Good night.Night.

16:15.422 --> 16:18.598
Forgot the paper
after all that.

16:19.702 --> 16:21.532
Memory like a sieve.

16:22.705 --> 16:23.775
Night.

16:25.639 --> 16:28.366
Remember,
it'’s his farm, not ours.

16:28.401 --> 16:30.782
It'’s Lord Grantham's farm,
and he'’s only the tenant.

16:30.817 --> 16:33.544
Maybe.
But don'’t say anything
you'’ll regret.

16:33.578 --> 16:38.031
That'’s the problem.
I'’m bound to in the end,
and then where will we be?

16:38.066 --> 16:40.758
Murray'’s had the will
translated.

16:40.792 --> 16:45.142
Apparently,
Montmirail refers to
an idyllic interlude

16:45.176 --> 16:48.593
he spent with Mama
as a young man
before he was married.

16:48.628 --> 16:50.423
What else did Murray
have to say?

16:50.457 --> 16:51.631
Why, it'’s odd.

16:51.665 --> 16:53.529
The widow wants
to fight the will,

16:53.564 --> 16:56.256
but the son believes it can be
settled in a friendly way.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.845
I'’d cover the villa
with barbed wire
and board up the windows.

16:58.879 --> 17:01.503
He says he'’d like us
to visit him there.

17:01.537 --> 17:03.125
Now, clearly Mama
can'’t travel,

17:03.160 --> 17:05.300
but he asked us to bring
Tom and Lucy with us

17:05.334 --> 17:07.440
now that he knows Sybbie
is to be the beneficiary.

17:07.474 --> 17:08.682
What do you think?

17:08.717 --> 17:11.340
Well, we could
get to know Lucy better.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.204
And with any luck,
it would mean

17:13.239 --> 17:15.448
we'’d miss the whole
of Mary'’s frightful film.

17:16.863 --> 17:18.865
I found it.
Myrna Dalgleish.

17:18.899 --> 17:20.522
I knew I had
a good one of her.

17:20.556 --> 17:22.455
Her beauty is so classic.

17:22.489 --> 17:24.353
I'’ve got one of him.

17:24.388 --> 17:27.460
Guy Dexter in Casanova.

17:27.494 --> 17:28.702
The very thought of it
makes me blush.

17:28.737 --> 17:30.325
There is
something about him.

17:30.359 --> 17:31.740
Like a wild animal
ready to spring.

17:31.774 --> 17:33.224
Ready to spring on you,
you mean.

17:35.123 --> 17:36.745
You'’ll have Andy and me jealous
if you don'’t watch out.

17:36.779 --> 17:38.643
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.269
I hate that you'’ll miss
all the fun.

17:43.303 --> 17:46.755
I'’m nervous now,
leaving you alone
with Guy Dexter.

17:46.789 --> 17:49.413
The chance would be
a fine thing.

17:49.447 --> 17:52.554
What do you think, Bertie?A complication.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.590
Tom says they'’d have
to bring Maud Bagshaw.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.661
She'’s living with them
until her house is ready.

17:56.696 --> 17:59.112
We can all stay
in an hotel.

17:59.147 --> 18:00.907
In that case,
can we come?

18:00.941 --> 18:03.530
-I'’d love it.
-We wouldn'’t be in the way?

18:03.565 --> 18:06.154
-So everyone'’s going except me?
-And me.

18:06.188 --> 18:10.158
I'’ve been thinking about an
article on people who visit the
South of France in the summer.

18:10.192 --> 18:12.263
Are you writing again?
I'’m pleased.

18:12.298 --> 18:15.197
Edith'’s back at the magazine
for a couple of days a week.

18:15.232 --> 18:16.509
And little Peter?

18:16.543 --> 18:18.476
Has a wonderful nanny,
thank heavens.

18:18.511 --> 18:20.651
Can you really work
with two young children

18:20.685 --> 18:22.618
while running a house
like Brancaster?

18:22.653 --> 18:25.138
Ask me in six months'’ time.

18:25.173 --> 18:27.692
Well, I'’m glad to hear
you'’re doing something
with your brain again.

18:27.727 --> 18:29.280
Let'’s hope
it'’s still there.

18:29.315 --> 18:30.523
I'’ll telephone
Montmirail tomorrow

18:30.557 --> 18:32.904
and explain
we'’ll be in an hotel.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.458
I should think
he'’ll be relieved.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.151
Come in.

18:39.497 --> 18:41.741
-I saw the light was still on.

18:43.191 --> 18:46.159
I suppose you agree with Papa
that the whole idea of a film

18:46.194 --> 18:48.403
is too common
to even be considered.

18:48.437 --> 18:52.614
Nothing is too common
if it will help to
keep Downton afloat.

18:52.648 --> 18:54.616
Well, we'’d have enough money
for a new roof.

18:54.650 --> 18:57.274
At the cost
of one terrible month.

18:57.308 --> 19:00.518
Honestly, I do think
it will be pretty terrible.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.865
But the sight
of old washbasins
catching rainwater

19:02.900 --> 19:04.902
in the attics
is terrible too.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.525
We got through the war.
We can get through this.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.287
But you must be firm, Mary.

19:10.321 --> 19:14.567
To those people,
women like us fall
into two categories:

19:14.601 --> 19:17.294
dragons and fools.

19:17.328 --> 19:20.538
You must make sure they
think of you as a dragon.

19:26.786 --> 19:28.512
Mr. Bates and Miss Baxter

19:28.546 --> 19:30.445
will go to look after
Lord and Lady Grantham.

19:30.479 --> 19:33.448
The rest will stay at Downton
to help with the film people.

19:33.482 --> 19:35.553
You'’ll get no help
from me.

19:35.588 --> 19:37.659
In contrast to
Miss Won'’t-Lift-a-Finger,

19:37.693 --> 19:39.626
I'’d love to help.

19:39.661 --> 19:41.628
Could I be
Miss Dalgleish'’s
lady'’s maid?

19:41.663 --> 19:43.906
I'’ve asked Anna
to take that on.

19:43.941 --> 19:45.598
I don'’t want to be
a spoilsport, Daisy,

19:45.632 --> 19:47.393
but you do have
a job down here.

19:47.427 --> 19:49.774
We know Miss Dalgleish
is staying in the house?

19:49.809 --> 19:51.880
She is, with the director
and the leading man.

19:51.914 --> 19:54.676
The rest are going to
put up in the village.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.506
Now, I need to go
and see Lady Mary.

19:57.541 --> 20:01.372
Oh, don'’t worry, Daisy.
Anna will find a way
to get you in there.

20:01.407 --> 20:04.030
Well, I'’d exchange it all for
a trip to the South of France.

20:04.064 --> 20:06.826
Daisy?

20:06.860 --> 20:10.381
He'’s opposed, I'm afraid,
milady, and says he must

20:10.416 --> 20:13.660
stand watch
and keep them in check.

20:13.695 --> 20:15.559
I don'’t know how helpful
that will be.

20:16.732 --> 20:18.631
We'’ve got to
get rid of him.

20:18.665 --> 20:19.908
But how?

20:21.634 --> 20:24.050
I should travel to France
with the rest of the party?

20:24.084 --> 20:26.052
Really?

20:26.086 --> 20:30.021
She worries that
everything will be odd and
foreign for His Lordship.

20:30.056 --> 20:32.058
And neither Mr. Bates
nor Miss Baxter

20:32.092 --> 20:35.061
will have the authority
to make sure it'’s
all done properly.

20:35.095 --> 20:36.511
Yes. I see.

20:36.545 --> 20:38.754
His Lordship needs you,
Charlie.

20:38.789 --> 20:41.654
Only you can show them
how things should be managed.

20:41.688 --> 20:42.965
Don'’t you worry about that.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.002
They'’d better be warned.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.590
The British are coming.

20:46.624 --> 20:48.971
But what would
I do with him?

20:49.006 --> 20:51.733
And wouldn'’t it be
rather an imposition
on the Montmirails?

20:51.767 --> 20:55.081
He longs to be useful to you,
Papa, as he always did.

20:55.115 --> 20:58.705
Couldn'’t you give him
the feeling that he'’d help you
just by being there?

20:58.740 --> 21:02.847
I will if you insist,
but it seems
very sentimental to me.

21:05.091 --> 21:06.644
Hold it right there.

21:06.679 --> 21:08.439
Right, you lot, go behind him.

21:10.821 --> 21:13.513
You two, come on, pull along.

21:13.548 --> 21:15.343
Follow the wardrobe mistress.Pass me those.

21:15.377 --> 21:16.551
She'’ll show you where to go.

21:18.035 --> 21:20.106
No, that'’s private.Oh, I see.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.384
This way. Here they are.

21:24.766 --> 21:26.595
Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:31.635 --> 21:33.568
Yeah.Yes, please. That'’s it.

21:33.602 --> 21:34.810
You'’re an angel.

22:00.905 --> 22:03.805
Hello, Mr. Molesley.
Why are you here?

22:03.839 --> 22:05.945
You know I love anything
to do with films.

22:05.979 --> 22:09.120
Well, I know you enjoy
a trip to the pictures.Ah, it'’s more than that.

22:09.155 --> 22:12.883
For me, Hollywood is
the ultimate dream factory.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.368
And I need dreams
as much as the next man.

22:16.024 --> 22:17.128
Mm.

22:17.163 --> 22:19.407
All this for one woman.

22:19.441 --> 22:22.030
I give you
Miss Dalgleish'’s wardrobe.

22:22.064 --> 22:24.860
I know, but just fancy.

22:30.590 --> 22:33.075
No, do it properly.

22:45.502 --> 22:47.745
Sorry.Nice and steady, lads.
Keep it moving.

22:47.780 --> 22:49.782
Keep it just over there.

22:49.816 --> 22:51.611
Thank you very much.Right you are.

22:51.646 --> 22:53.475
Watch your footing.

22:53.510 --> 22:56.858
Oh, you'’re all here,
hiding from the invaders.

22:56.892 --> 22:59.999
Sybbie!
Hello, darling.
What a lovely surprise.

23:00.033 --> 23:03.071
Tom had her driven so she
could be with her cousins
while we'’re in France.

23:03.105 --> 23:04.866
Oh, we'’ve been
talking about you.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.730
About me, Donk? Why?

23:06.764 --> 23:08.732
Any number of reasons,
all good.

23:08.766 --> 23:10.837
May I present
Miss Dalgleish.

23:10.872 --> 23:12.736
My father, Lord Grantham.

23:12.770 --> 23:14.634
She is one of the stars
of our film.

23:14.669 --> 23:15.980
I can easily believe it.

23:16.015 --> 23:17.913
Welcome to Downton,
Miss Dalgleish.

23:19.536 --> 23:20.744
Mm.

23:23.194 --> 23:26.128
The modern world
comes to Downton.

23:26.163 --> 23:29.753
-You'’ve told our host in France
that we'’re staying at an hotel?
-Oh, he wouldn'’t hear of it.

23:29.787 --> 23:31.202
He insists
we stay at the villa.

23:31.237 --> 23:33.101
Even though we'’re there
to steal it from them?

23:33.135 --> 23:35.793
He seems a very nice chap,
and his English is flawless,

23:35.828 --> 23:38.175
which is more than can
be said for my French.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.832
Mr. Guy Dexter.

23:41.558 --> 23:43.939
Welcome, Mr. Dexter.
I'’m Lord Grantham.

23:43.974 --> 23:46.632
This is my daughter,
Lady Mary Talbot.

23:46.666 --> 23:50.083
She'’ll look after you,
as the rest of us are off
to the Riviera.

23:50.118 --> 23:52.223
But I hope
you'’ll enjoy yourself here.

23:52.258 --> 23:54.018
I'’d come with you
if I could.

23:54.053 --> 23:56.538
You'’re English?Yes.

23:56.573 --> 23:59.817
I went over to America
ten years ago to try my luck,
and I'’ve been there ever since.

23:59.852 --> 24:01.509
Hmm.I'’m not the only one.

24:01.543 --> 24:03.165
They call us
the Hollywood Raj,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.513
and we all play cricket
once a week.

24:05.547 --> 24:07.169
And the weather
never stops play.

24:07.204 --> 24:09.586
-Do you know
the South of France?
-Last time I was there,

24:09.620 --> 24:13.072
I was marooned on the roof of
the Negresco with Ronald Colman
and Gloria Swanson.

24:13.106 --> 24:16.178
On the roof?You can tell us the rest
of that story at dinner.

24:16.213 --> 24:17.973
When are you leaving?Tomorrow.

24:18.008 --> 24:20.942
Uh, Dover, Calais and then
the Blue Train down to Nice.

24:20.976 --> 24:22.840
How enviable that sounds.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.670
When do you expect
your director?

24:24.704 --> 24:26.913
Oh, he'’ll be here for dinner.
Don'’t you think, Myrna?

24:26.948 --> 24:28.881
How should I know?

24:33.161 --> 24:35.853
Myrna Dalgleish
in this house.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.717
It seems incredible.

24:37.752 --> 24:40.651
Her dad sold fruit
in the old Borough Market.
Now look at her.

24:40.686 --> 24:42.308
A goddess of the screen.

24:42.342 --> 24:43.999
And you'’re going
to be her maid.

24:44.034 --> 24:46.070
She'’s brought
a mountain of luggage,

24:46.105 --> 24:48.556
so I thought you and Anna
could go together right now

24:48.590 --> 24:50.281
and offer to unpack.

24:50.316 --> 24:52.249
Just remember,
neither of you know this woman.

24:52.283 --> 24:56.218
She may not be the film star
you see in the fan magazines.

24:56.253 --> 24:59.152
Well, there'’s only
one way to find out.

24:59.187 --> 25:01.638
♪ And soon my tears are dry♪

25:01.672 --> 25:04.641
♪ In your eyes
I see you'’re still blue♪

25:04.675 --> 25:07.678
♪ Everything has changed
But you♪Thank you.

25:08.783 --> 25:10.336
-The Lady Grantham.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.200
I'’m sorry
to burst in on you.

25:12.234 --> 25:14.823
Not at all.The fact is
I'’ve made a new will,

25:14.858 --> 25:17.170
and I need you both
to witness my signature.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.793
I'’m just fussing.

25:18.827 --> 25:20.622
It'’s only my jewelry
and a few other pieces.

25:20.657 --> 25:22.969
It'’s always a good idea to
bring these things up to date.

25:23.004 --> 25:26.835
Murray was down anyway,
so I thought I would
take advantage of that.

25:26.870 --> 25:29.597
I'’m glad you've come,
because I wanted to tell you

25:29.631 --> 25:32.082
that Violet has asked us
to go through her things.

25:32.116 --> 25:33.980
What?
Why has she asked you?

25:34.015 --> 25:36.604
I really don'’t know,
but, of course,
anything of interest

25:36.638 --> 25:39.330
will be referred
to Robert and you.

25:39.365 --> 25:41.298
I just thought
you ought to be told.

25:41.332 --> 25:44.059
Well, she wants her death
to be ordered
and free of bother.

25:44.094 --> 25:45.716
It'’s all very
Violet-like, really.

25:45.751 --> 25:47.925
Are we wrong
to go to France?Oh, certainly not.

25:49.064 --> 25:50.618
Mary can send a telegram

25:50.652 --> 25:53.206
if there are
any dark developments.

25:53.241 --> 25:55.692
But there won'’t be.

25:55.726 --> 25:58.798
I don'’t pretend I've always
worshipped at her shrine,
but it will be strange.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.766
And Mary will miss her
when she'’s gone.

26:00.800 --> 26:04.804
-Mary will become her,
so the gap will be filled.

26:04.839 --> 26:07.738
And now I must run.
I'’m making dinner late
by being here.

26:10.223 --> 26:11.949
I'’ll see you
when we get back.

26:11.984 --> 26:13.606
Yes, of course.

26:14.987 --> 26:16.713
She'’s right.
It will be strange.

26:16.747 --> 26:20.579
I shall miss having
a sparring partner
to keep me trim.

26:22.063 --> 26:23.996
Be careful how you handle
them clothes.

26:24.030 --> 26:25.860
They'’re haute couture.

26:25.894 --> 26:28.656
I should go to
Lady Mary and Lady Hexham
to help them dress,

26:28.690 --> 26:30.416
so I'’ll leave Daisy
with the unpacking.

26:30.450 --> 26:32.418
I'’ll be back
when you'’re at dinner.

26:32.452 --> 26:35.110
So long as it'’s finished
and the trunks are gone
when I come up.

26:39.425 --> 26:41.876
What were you doing
on the roof of the Negresco?

26:41.910 --> 26:44.257
Oh, it was a scavenger hunt,
and we needed a chimney pot.

26:44.292 --> 26:48.399
But when we got up there,
they were huge, so we smashed
one and all took a piece.

26:48.434 --> 26:51.264
Oh, was the manager pleased?

26:51.299 --> 26:52.852
Well, it was good publicity.

26:52.887 --> 26:55.027
Is there such a thing
as good publicity?

26:55.061 --> 26:57.132
There is,
if you'’re in the movies.

26:57.167 --> 27:00.964
Well, I suppose the Russians
smash their glasses
for good luck.

27:00.998 --> 27:03.932
And now film people
smash other people'’s property

27:03.967 --> 27:06.141
for good publicity.

27:06.176 --> 27:07.729
Is this true,
Miss Dalgleish?

27:07.764 --> 27:10.007
Oh, I don'’t do nothing
unless I feel like it.

27:10.042 --> 27:11.733
Oh, how musical
you make it sound.

27:13.010 --> 27:15.012
Hold the plate nearer.

27:16.186 --> 27:18.913
How did you become
a film actress?

27:18.947 --> 27:21.053
A talent scout spotted me.

27:21.087 --> 27:23.296
Because I'’m so beautiful.

27:23.331 --> 27:25.816
It seems
wonderfully romantic.

27:25.851 --> 27:27.887
Well, it'’s not
that romantic.

27:27.922 --> 27:30.683
Not when you know
that every man in the room
just wants to give you one.

27:32.409 --> 27:35.239
What a colorful life
you lead.

27:37.069 --> 27:38.933
H-Have you made
many kinematographs

27:38.967 --> 27:40.451
traveling
around the country?

27:40.486 --> 27:42.833
I'’m afraid I'm rather glad
to be missing it.

27:42.868 --> 27:45.767
Well, I know you'’re only
doing it for the money,
but that'’s all right.

27:47.424 --> 27:50.461
What I never understand is how
you remember all those lines.

27:50.496 --> 27:52.187
Well, it'’s not theater.

27:52.222 --> 27:54.327
In fact, I'’m not even sure
it'’s proper acting.

27:54.362 --> 27:55.915
Oh, but isn'’t that
about to change?

27:55.950 --> 27:57.745
Aren'’t films
starting to talk?

27:57.779 --> 28:00.161
Couple of words here or there.
Nothing to frighten the horses.

28:00.195 --> 28:01.921
Says who?

28:01.956 --> 28:03.820
Get me a crème de menthe!

28:05.753 --> 28:08.238
Would it be possible
to remind Miss Dalgleish

28:08.272 --> 28:10.274
that the servants work hard
in this house

28:10.309 --> 28:11.759
and they are
doing their best?

28:11.793 --> 28:13.312
They'’re not
used to rudeness.

28:13.346 --> 28:15.003
Well, she'’s not
used to criticism.

28:15.038 --> 28:17.247
Her face on the screen
sells a million tickets,

28:17.281 --> 28:19.421
and she knows it.Cheers.

28:19.456 --> 28:20.871
I see.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.397
Well, I got my
first picture when I was 20.

28:31.226 --> 28:33.194
Thank you.

28:36.093 --> 28:37.474
I'’m the butler, sir.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.407
Please tell me if there'’s
anything you need.

28:39.441 --> 28:42.410
Anything I need?
Seems rather a tall order.

28:44.377 --> 28:47.001
I'’m sorry.
I'’m-I'm teasing you.

28:47.035 --> 28:50.798
What I should'’ve said was
I have everything I need.

28:50.832 --> 28:52.213
Thank you so much.

28:52.247 --> 28:54.318
Very good, sir.

28:56.804 --> 29:00.946
Oh, put that guidebook down,
Charlie, and go to sleep.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.396
Mm, let me finish
the chapter.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.956
You won'’t believe
what these people eat.

29:20.897 --> 29:22.553
Sorry.

29:24.176 --> 29:25.867
Come on, Carson.Coming through.

29:25.902 --> 29:29.146
Let'’s run for it
before things get any worse.

29:29.181 --> 29:31.873
I hope you'’ve got
a Mediterranean version

29:31.908 --> 29:33.910
of that outfit,
or you'’ll boil.

29:33.944 --> 29:36.429
Don'’t worry about me,
milord.Hmm.

29:39.018 --> 29:41.538
-And you'’re going
to be good, aren'’t you?
-Goodbye, Papa.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.264
Look after Teo.Of course.

29:43.298 --> 29:45.404
Now, have a lovely time,
no matter what they'’re like.

29:45.438 --> 29:46.819
Yeah. We'’ll do our best.

29:46.854 --> 29:49.995
Now, don'’t get
into any scrapes.

29:50.029 --> 29:52.204
I have found,
when dealing with foreigners,

29:52.238 --> 29:56.484
if one speaks loudly and slowly,
they'’ll bend to your will.

29:56.518 --> 29:58.831
Not too loudly
and not too slowly.

29:58.866 --> 30:01.075
Uh, no, no, Andrew.
Andrew. No, no.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.421
Thank you, Bates.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.390
-Ah.
-We'’ve come to wish you luck.

30:06.425 --> 30:08.392
Well, you only
just caught us,

30:08.427 --> 30:10.325
as we set off
on our strange mission.

30:14.364 --> 30:16.193
Well.

30:16.228 --> 30:18.299
I'’m sorry
you'’ll miss the filming.

30:18.333 --> 30:21.612
Will you watch it
while we'’re away?I will if they let me.

30:22.337 --> 30:23.925
Try and enjoy yourself.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.031
No need to say
the same to you.

30:26.065 --> 30:29.344
Please make sure that Johnnie
keeps his nose clean.It will be done, sir.

30:36.282 --> 30:39.872
Everyone aboard
or we'’ll miss the train.

30:46.465 --> 30:50.124
Don'’t think I've ever seen
so many lovely looking ladies.

30:50.158 --> 30:51.953
Cup of tea
for Miss Dalgleish.

30:51.988 --> 30:54.922
I'’ve just made some.
Daisy can take it up.

30:54.956 --> 30:56.993
Oh, I'’ll do that.
I want to.

30:57.027 --> 30:59.202
No, let me. Please.

30:59.236 --> 31:01.031
Lady Mary won'’t mind.
I'’m begging you.

31:01.066 --> 31:02.343
Steady on, Daisy.

31:02.377 --> 31:04.103
Uh, but I'’ll fetch
the tray after.

31:19.187 --> 31:21.327
This is for you,
Miss Dalgleish.

31:21.362 --> 31:24.399
I never got a chance
to say how exciting it is
that you'’re here.

31:25.228 --> 31:26.643
I love your pictures.

31:26.677 --> 31:29.163
You'’ve been such
an inspiration to me.

31:29.197 --> 31:30.681
Since I first
saw Star-Crossed...

31:30.716 --> 31:33.236
Can we get a move on?Right away.

31:33.270 --> 31:35.100
Positions, everyone.

31:37.412 --> 31:38.655
She'’s the actress?

31:38.689 --> 31:40.519
Roll the camera.

31:40.553 --> 31:42.659
Harry.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.489
-And action!

31:45.524 --> 31:48.147
You walk downstairs

31:48.182 --> 31:50.046
and find him with your eyes.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.600
You halt and walk on.

31:52.634 --> 31:55.085
But he'’s waiting for you.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.639
Tell her she looks beautiful.

31:57.674 --> 32:00.366
You'’re delighted to hear it,
but you cannot admit it.

32:03.680 --> 32:07.132
You look into his eyes.
Will you let him kiss you?

32:07.166 --> 32:08.443
It feels as if you might.

32:08.478 --> 32:10.445
Wait! Wait! Who'’s he?

32:10.480 --> 32:12.102
-Cut, cut, cut, cut.

32:12.137 --> 32:13.448
So-- I'’m ever so sorry.

32:13.483 --> 32:15.174
Wait,
I-I can'’t work like this.

32:15.209 --> 32:17.763
Oh, it'’s Molesley.
He'’s a great favorite here.

32:17.797 --> 32:19.420
You don'’t mind him
watching, do you?

32:19.454 --> 32:21.042
I'’m sure they don't
mind him watching.

32:21.077 --> 32:22.561
They just don'’t
want him in it.Oh.

32:22.595 --> 32:24.080
No. Well spotted.

32:24.114 --> 32:25.633
So now you just
do it all again?

32:25.667 --> 32:27.117
Exactly.Oh.

32:27.152 --> 32:30.362
I'’d rather earn my living
down a mine.

32:30.396 --> 32:32.398
First positions, please.Oh.

32:32.433 --> 32:33.675
Roll the camera.

32:33.710 --> 32:34.711
Harry.

32:36.092 --> 32:37.472
-And action!

32:37.507 --> 32:39.474
As if he did that again.Coming down the stairs,

32:39.509 --> 32:41.442
not expecting to find him there
waiting for you.

32:48.345 --> 32:51.762
If I'’d known we were all going
to be staying at the villa,
I'’m not sure I'd have come.

32:51.797 --> 32:55.111
Why not?You don'’t think it might be
a little awkward?

32:55.145 --> 32:57.423
When we'’ve appropriated
this family'’s home?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.736
I'’m not sure
that'’s the sensible way
to look at it.

32:59.770 --> 33:03.809
I'’m just glad Sybbie will be
on much more equal terms
with her cousins.

33:03.843 --> 33:08.779
Violet is giving
your child a great opportunity,
a real start in life.

33:09.815 --> 33:11.644
Does her generosity
surprise you?

33:11.679 --> 33:14.130
Attila the Hun
loved his family.

33:20.722 --> 33:22.517
You all right, Mr. Carson?

33:22.552 --> 33:26.418
"All right"
is not the first phrase
that springs to mind.

33:26.452 --> 33:28.799
I'’ve brought you
some chicken soup,
Mr. Carson.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.202
I think she sounds
very rude.

33:52.237 --> 33:54.342
I expect she'’s done in.

33:54.377 --> 33:56.724
Well, it must be difficult when
the whole film depends on you.

33:56.758 --> 33:58.726
It depends
on Mr. Dexter, too,

33:58.760 --> 34:00.452
and he seems
very well-mannered.

34:00.486 --> 34:02.385
And so attractive.

34:02.419 --> 34:04.111
Oi, oi.
Are you up to something?

34:04.145 --> 34:05.767
If I were,
would I tell you?

34:07.286 --> 34:08.632
Mr. Molesley'’s
in the film now.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.772
-I wasn'’t sure where to stand.

34:10.807 --> 34:13.499
Why don'’t we let the film people
get on with their work

34:13.534 --> 34:15.398
while we get on with ours.

34:15.432 --> 34:17.710
Listen to him, Daisy,
before you run away
to join the circus.

35:15.941 --> 35:18.288
I say, how are we all?
How did we all survive?

35:18.323 --> 35:20.221
All right? Yes.

35:20.256 --> 35:22.361
Some of those cliffs
were a bit tricky, weren'’t they?

35:22.396 --> 35:24.639
Well, shall we?Oh, the color
of the sea.

35:24.674 --> 35:25.882
Ah.

35:30.611 --> 35:32.302
Monsieur de Montmirail?

35:32.337 --> 35:35.236
Lord Grantham. Bienvenu.

35:35.271 --> 35:36.789
Well, we'’ve become
quite a party.

35:36.824 --> 35:38.619
I'’m afraid we've even
brought our butler.

35:38.653 --> 35:40.793
I'’m not quite sure why.But how chic.

35:40.828 --> 35:42.588
Now, come in, everybody.

35:42.623 --> 35:44.935
Come on.Just going to feel
like I need a drink.

35:44.970 --> 35:46.627
And I could do
with a sit-down.

35:46.661 --> 35:49.250
I can imagine.

35:52.978 --> 35:55.187
-Welcome.
-Merci.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.228
Maman.

36:01.262 --> 36:03.506
May I present
Lord Grantham.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.508
My mother.
La Marquise de Montmirail.

36:05.542 --> 36:06.923
Madame.

36:06.957 --> 36:09.201
Uh, this is Lady Grantham,
Lord and Lady Hexham,

36:09.236 --> 36:11.238
Lady Bagshaw
and Mr. and Mrs. Branson.

36:11.272 --> 36:14.413
Ah, Monsieur Branson,
father of the lucky child.

36:14.448 --> 36:16.553
How happy you must be.

36:16.588 --> 36:18.728
My wife and I are
very glad to be here.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.662
I must say straightaway how
kind you are to include us all.

36:21.696 --> 36:23.284
We'’re delighted,
Lord Hexham.

36:23.319 --> 36:24.941
Aren'’t we, maman?

36:24.975 --> 36:26.356
Delighted.

36:28.255 --> 36:29.566
Thank you, Mrs. Patmore.

36:29.601 --> 36:32.604
Thank you.Uh, mind you eat them slowly.

36:32.638 --> 36:34.744
Whoa.

36:34.778 --> 36:36.642
Oh. Mr. Mason.

36:36.677 --> 36:39.266
How are you?
Are you on your way
back to the farm?

36:39.300 --> 36:41.992
I wanted to give
the young couple a break.
They'’re never alone.

36:42.027 --> 36:43.718
They always
have to put up with me.

36:43.753 --> 36:45.824
Well, it'’s your house
to do as you like.

36:45.858 --> 36:47.860
But I want them to feel
it'’s their home,

36:47.895 --> 36:51.036
so that when
I surrender the tenancy,
they'’ll take it on.

36:51.070 --> 36:52.486
What will you do?

36:52.520 --> 36:53.763
Don'’t you worry about me.

36:53.797 --> 36:55.558
You'’ve got
your own concerns.

36:55.592 --> 36:56.766
Well, I do worry about you.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.320
Oh, thank you. Oof.

36:59.355 --> 37:03.255
Call sheets for tomorrow
will be issued in an hour
and delivered to your digs.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.877
A good day?

37:04.912 --> 37:06.879
It'’s always good
if we get through the schedule.

37:06.914 --> 37:08.743
What'’s that?
Good news, I hope.

37:08.778 --> 37:11.850
Not really.
My husband isn'’t coming back
when he said.

37:11.884 --> 37:13.645
Must be a disappointment.

37:13.679 --> 37:15.647
It'’s a disappointment
but not a surprise.

37:15.681 --> 37:18.857
Half past- 00
is too late for me.
I like to eat at- 00.

37:18.891 --> 37:22.481
It'’s difficult for the kitchen
if we change the usual timings.

37:27.106 --> 37:29.281
I wish I could see
the star magic.

37:29.316 --> 37:31.835
Well, I tell you what.
One of her films is
showing in Thirsk.

37:31.870 --> 37:34.459
Why don'’t we catch it?I should say no.

37:34.493 --> 37:36.288
Why?

37:36.323 --> 37:38.290
None of your family'’s here.
You'’re your own mistress.

37:39.395 --> 37:40.913
All right.

37:40.948 --> 37:43.985
I'’ll warn Barrow,
put on a coat
and tell Granny.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.441
Now, Granny, don'’t be cross,

37:51.476 --> 37:53.478
but I'’m going into Thirsk
to see a film.

37:53.512 --> 37:55.411
On your own?

37:55.445 --> 37:57.413
With Mr. Barber,
the director.

37:57.447 --> 38:00.864
Have you heard
from Henry lately?

38:00.899 --> 38:02.901
He sent a telegram today.

38:02.935 --> 38:04.903
He'’s not coming back yet.

38:04.937 --> 38:06.801
Denker, change of plan.

38:06.836 --> 38:10.046
I won'’t get dressed.
I'’ll have my dinner on a tray.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.461
Milady.

38:16.984 --> 38:18.882
I am sorry.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.815
It'’s not your fault

38:20.850 --> 38:24.992
that Miss Dalgleish has
all the charm of a verruca.

38:25.026 --> 38:26.821
Well, Mr. Dexter'’s nice.

38:26.856 --> 38:29.548
He can stick up for himself
without my help.

38:29.583 --> 38:31.032
Doesn'’t filming
interest you?

38:31.067 --> 38:34.829
I watched some of it.
I'’d rather eat pebbles.

38:34.864 --> 38:36.624
In fact,

38:36.659 --> 38:38.143
I think I'’ll retire
to my bed.

38:38.177 --> 38:40.835
At least
until they'’ve all gone.

38:40.870 --> 38:42.630
Should I be worried?

38:42.665 --> 38:46.358
Well, Florence Nightingale took
to her bed at the age of 38.

38:46.393 --> 38:47.911
She died at 90.

38:47.946 --> 38:49.706
You would tell me,
wouldn'’t you?

38:50.569 --> 38:52.675
What do you think?

38:52.709 --> 38:54.124
Go on.

39:00.683 --> 39:02.616
And you, Lord Grantham?

39:02.650 --> 39:04.652
Are you familiar
with the South of France?

39:04.687 --> 39:06.896
I know Lord Brougham
first made it fashionable

39:06.930 --> 39:09.001
in the 1830s
when he was chancellor.

39:09.036 --> 39:12.039
So you'’re only taking back
what is yours by right?

39:12.073 --> 39:15.870
I wouldn'’t say that,
but I do see why you
find it upsetting.

39:15.905 --> 39:17.562
But here you are,

39:17.596 --> 39:20.427
eyeing up the furniture,
measuring the curtains.

39:20.461 --> 39:22.567
Maman, please. We can
always buy another villa.

39:22.601 --> 39:26.847
We'’re here because
your son invited us.

39:26.881 --> 39:28.538
But I suppose
I would like to know

39:28.573 --> 39:30.402
why your husband
did what he did.

39:30.437 --> 39:32.784
I'’ve asked our lawyer
to join us here in a few days.

39:32.818 --> 39:34.924
I think
it'’s an excellent idea.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.891
Until then, I hope
you'’ll enjoy your stay.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.829
Your butler lends a welcome air
of splendor to the proceedings.

39:43.864 --> 39:46.073
But he can stand down
if you prefer.

39:46.107 --> 39:48.765
Why, when the villa already
belongs to your granddaughter?

39:48.800 --> 39:53.494
Lady Bagshaw,
please come and sit here.

39:53.529 --> 39:56.428
-I am so sorry.

39:56.463 --> 39:58.948
I laid down for five minutes,
shut my eyes, and that was it.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.225
I was gone.

40:00.259 --> 40:01.951
Welcome to
the Villa of the Doves.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.194
-You must come here a lot.
-We do.

40:04.229 --> 40:07.543
Or rather, we did,
before you entered our lives.

40:07.577 --> 40:10.166
Always in the winter
for as long as I can remember.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.789
But now coming
in the warmer months
is catching on.

40:12.824 --> 40:14.757
I'’m planning
an article on that.

40:14.791 --> 40:16.172
You'’re a writer,
Lady Hexham?

40:16.206 --> 40:17.967
More of a journalist,
I'’m afraid.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.935
I have a magazine,
and I'’m taking back
control of it.

40:20.970 --> 40:22.558
What'’s your article about?

40:22.592 --> 40:26.631
Oh, uh, Scott Fitzgerald,
Zelda, Coco Chanel.

40:26.665 --> 40:29.150
All the people
that got the hotels
to stay open in July.

40:30.255 --> 40:32.775
Can I publish some pictures
of the villa?

40:32.809 --> 40:34.570
Might that be possible?

40:34.604 --> 40:35.916
Of course.

40:35.950 --> 40:37.987
If we can see the images
before you use them.

40:38.021 --> 40:40.576
Ah, you'’re obviously not
the first journalist he'’s met.

40:44.096 --> 40:45.650
Tickets, please.

40:48.618 --> 40:50.551
We'’re going to have to defer
our appreciation

40:50.586 --> 40:53.071
of Miss Dalgleish'’s attractions
to another time.

40:53.105 --> 40:56.246
This isn'’t her film.
The Terroris the first
all-talking picture

40:56.281 --> 40:57.869
to show in Britain.

40:57.903 --> 40:59.871
I thought that was
The Jazz Singer.Oh, no.

40:59.905 --> 41:03.150
In that, Al Jolson just says
a few words to his old mother.And sings.

41:03.184 --> 41:05.532
In this, they talk
all the way through.

41:05.566 --> 41:07.085
Mm.Where'’s the Rialto?

41:07.119 --> 41:09.674
Uh, take the next left
and park.

41:14.886 --> 41:18.821
Lady Mary'’s gone
to the pictures in Thirsk
with Mr. Barber,

41:18.855 --> 41:21.133
and old Lady Grantham'’s
eating in her room.

41:21.168 --> 41:24.551
So Mr. Dexter and Miss Dalgleish
will be dining alone.

41:24.585 --> 41:26.138
Have you let Mrs. Patmore know?

41:26.173 --> 41:27.070
I have.

41:28.140 --> 41:29.935
We all pity Mr. Dexter.

41:31.834 --> 41:33.249
What'’s the matter?

41:33.283 --> 41:35.803
Oh, you wouldn'’t be interested,
Mrs. Hughes.

41:35.838 --> 41:37.218
Try me.

41:38.150 --> 41:39.704
If you want to.

41:49.714 --> 41:53.338
When we had the royal visit,
do you remember a valet
called Ellis?

41:53.372 --> 41:55.340
I do.

41:55.374 --> 41:58.964
You and he were
quite friendly, I recall.

41:58.999 --> 42:02.865
I had a letter from him
this morning

42:02.899 --> 42:04.694
saying he'’s getting married.

42:06.075 --> 42:08.905
And that'’s sad?

42:10.044 --> 42:11.736
I know it shouldn'’t be.

42:12.806 --> 42:16.948
Mr. Barrow, your path in life
is a hard one.

42:16.982 --> 42:19.882
Most people
in your position

42:19.916 --> 42:22.263
choose to hide
behind appearances

42:22.298 --> 42:25.957
that will allow them to avoid
persecution and rejection.

42:25.991 --> 42:28.649
He'’s surely
not to be blamed for it.

42:30.858 --> 42:33.274
It isn'’t what I want,
Mrs. Hughes.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.933
Then you'’re a brave man.

42:36.968 --> 42:40.074
But you'’re also destined
to be a lonely one.

42:40.109 --> 42:41.904
Unless you'’re
very fortunate.

43:04.961 --> 43:08.102
I thought you said her face
could sell a million tickets.

43:08.137 --> 43:10.173
Not in Thirsk, apparently.

43:14.730 --> 43:18.043
But you'’re right, of course.
She is very beautiful.

43:31.470 --> 43:33.265
How wonderful this is.

43:33.300 --> 43:36.372
I'’m still curious
as to why we'’re here.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.823
If you'’d come to England,
you could have met Mama,

43:38.857 --> 43:40.721
which would'’ve
made more sense.

43:40.756 --> 43:43.206
It was you I wanted to meet
more than old Lady Grantham.

43:43.241 --> 43:44.656
And your mother?

43:44.691 --> 43:47.141
The situation is
more delicate for her,

43:47.176 --> 43:48.418
but she'’ll be all right.

43:48.453 --> 43:50.041
I'’ll make sure of that.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.943
That way.Mm.

43:57.289 --> 43:58.981
What do think their game is?

43:59.015 --> 44:00.948
To lull us into
a sense of security

44:00.983 --> 44:02.191
then whack us
with a lawsuit?

44:02.225 --> 44:03.813
Maybe they want us
to feel guilty

44:03.848 --> 44:05.815
and withdraw
from the field.

44:05.850 --> 44:08.093
I think it'’s just
that Monsieur de Montmirail
loved his father,

44:08.128 --> 44:10.061
and he intends
to carry out his wishes.

44:10.095 --> 44:11.959
And we'’re here
to represent Granny,

44:11.994 --> 44:13.685
the mystery figure
in all this.

44:36.950 --> 44:38.261
Bonjour, monsieur.

44:38.296 --> 44:40.747
Glare. Um, no.

44:40.781 --> 44:42.783
Um, cover.

44:42.818 --> 44:45.027
C-- Uh, cool.

44:45.061 --> 44:46.166
Yes.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.926
Carson?Oh.

44:49.100 --> 44:50.342
May I be of help?

44:50.377 --> 44:54.277
Um...

44:54.312 --> 44:57.073
I thought maybe this one.

44:57.108 --> 44:59.800
It makes you look like
King Zog of Albania.

45:00.974 --> 45:02.803
Yeah.

45:03.908 --> 45:05.150
Oh, perfect.

45:05.185 --> 45:07.152
Oh. No, no, no.

45:07.187 --> 45:10.155
I wouldn'’t hear of it.It was my choice,
so I should pay.

45:10.190 --> 45:13.227
Yeah, but I'’m the one
who has to wear it. Um...

45:13.262 --> 45:17.059
Thanks for your custom, sir.
Both you and your wife.

45:24.860 --> 45:27.138
If you were selling menswear
when you first got
to Hollywood,

45:27.172 --> 45:28.864
how did you break
into films?

45:28.898 --> 45:31.176
Well, one day, they asked me
to pose for a trade journal

45:31.211 --> 45:32.764
in a suit
that they were marketing,

45:32.799 --> 45:34.870
and an agent came
and signed me up.

45:34.904 --> 45:36.975
Because you'’re so handsome.Oh.

45:37.010 --> 45:39.150
I thought they were excited
by my acting talent.

45:39.184 --> 45:41.014
Come on, girls.
Get to wardrobe.

45:41.048 --> 45:43.050
We all want to go home.

45:44.431 --> 45:47.261
Now you know
why I'’m in the movies.
How did you become a butler?

45:47.296 --> 45:48.987
Well, it'’s a lot
less glamorous.

45:49.022 --> 45:50.402
I got a job as a hallboy.

45:50.437 --> 45:53.267
Then I was a junior footman,
first footman, valet

45:53.302 --> 45:55.373
and finally butler.

45:55.407 --> 45:57.789
There'’s not much
I couldn'’t tell you about
how to run a house, sir.

45:57.824 --> 45:59.480
See, that'’s the difference
between you and me.

45:59.515 --> 46:01.586
I don'’t know what I'm doing
half the time.

46:01.620 --> 46:03.346
That'’s not
what it looks like.

46:03.381 --> 46:06.798
Oh, thank you, Mr....

46:06.833 --> 46:08.938
Just Barrow, sir.

46:08.973 --> 46:10.215
Right, Guy.

46:10.250 --> 46:12.148
Let'’s rehearse, please.

46:16.359 --> 46:18.258
Myrna, say the line.

46:19.638 --> 46:21.192
I saved you a mallet.

46:21.226 --> 46:24.402
I always think they look
like instruments of war.

46:24.436 --> 46:25.852
It'’s because they are.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.577
There'’s a telephone call
for you.

46:27.612 --> 46:29.614
A Mr. Bullock.
He says it'’s urgent.

46:29.648 --> 46:32.030
Five minutes, everyone!

46:33.514 --> 46:35.447
There'’s a drama
going on below.

46:35.482 --> 46:38.347
The man in charge was
shouting down the telephone
when I came up.

46:38.381 --> 46:41.005
Apparently, they'’re making
the wrong sort of film.

46:41.039 --> 46:42.489
Is there a right sort?

46:42.523 --> 46:44.042
Well, all I know is

46:44.077 --> 46:47.218
it seems the public
only want films that talk.

46:47.252 --> 46:49.220
I should'’ve thought
the best thing about films

46:49.254 --> 46:51.463
is that you can'’t hear them.

46:51.498 --> 46:53.880
Be even better
if you couldn'’t
see them either.

46:55.433 --> 46:56.606
Everybody,
gather around, please!

46:56.641 --> 46:59.126
Everybody!

47:01.197 --> 47:03.648
We are suspending production.

47:03.682 --> 47:05.167
I-I know. I know.

47:05.201 --> 47:07.238
I'’m sorry to be
the bearer of bad news.

47:07.272 --> 47:09.619
We'’ll contact you all
when we'’ve finalized our plans.

47:09.654 --> 47:11.449
Thank you.

47:11.483 --> 47:14.452
What is it?
What'’s happened?

47:14.486 --> 47:17.455
Well, it seems the talkies are
making too much money to ignore,

47:17.489 --> 47:21.114
while our picture
is silent and too expensive
to make its costs back,

47:21.148 --> 47:23.461
so they want
to cut their losses
and shut us down.

47:23.495 --> 47:25.670
But how sad.It is worse than sad

47:25.704 --> 47:27.534
for the men and women
working on it.

47:27.568 --> 47:29.260
We still owe our extras
back pay,

47:29.294 --> 47:31.469
and now they'’re out of a job.

47:31.503 --> 47:34.299
I told you. I...Excuse me.

47:34.334 --> 47:35.576
Myrna.

47:35.611 --> 47:37.440
W-Why is he stopping?

47:37.475 --> 47:40.512
Apparently, silent films
aren'’t making any money now.

47:40.547 --> 47:41.962
I saw it the other night.

47:41.997 --> 47:43.688
The cinema
was almost empty.

47:43.722 --> 47:44.931
What a shame.

47:44.965 --> 47:46.311
I feel sorry
for Mr. Barber.

47:46.346 --> 47:48.244
He doesn'’t deserve this.Enough.

47:52.041 --> 47:53.974
I wish I could help.

47:54.009 --> 47:56.114
Oh, uh--
I wish you could, too,
but I don'’t see how.

47:56.149 --> 47:59.186
We'’re making a silent.
They only want to
release talkies, so...

47:59.221 --> 48:01.499
Well, why couldn'’t this be
turned into a talking film?

48:01.533 --> 48:03.915
What would that mean?

48:03.950 --> 48:06.676
Getting a technician
down from London.

48:06.711 --> 48:08.126
He could record sound

48:08.161 --> 48:10.128
for scenes
we'’ve already made and...

48:10.163 --> 48:13.338
And then put
new speeches into the rest.
Why wouldn'’t that work?

48:13.373 --> 48:14.615
Uh...

48:16.376 --> 48:19.241
Mr. Mason'’s
driving me mad.

48:19.275 --> 48:21.277
Every cup and saucer
has to be right.

48:21.312 --> 48:24.487
The fact is
you'’re his daughter-in-law.
His son died in the war.

48:24.522 --> 48:27.525
I mean, it'’s no wonder
he and I rub each other
up the wrong way.

48:27.559 --> 48:31.253
Well, it'’s a shame
he'’s getting on your nerves
because he'’s a lovely chap.

48:31.287 --> 48:32.979
And he thinks the world
of you, Daisy.

48:33.013 --> 48:35.084
Weren'’t you
sweet on him once?

48:35.119 --> 48:37.224
About a hundred years ago.

48:39.123 --> 48:41.470
I hear there'’s a sound
expert coming down from London.

48:41.504 --> 48:43.196
Don'’t remind me.

48:45.267 --> 48:47.959
Are you all right?
Can I help?

48:47.994 --> 48:49.719
No one can help me now.

48:57.589 --> 48:59.453
Well.

48:59.488 --> 49:02.525
If it isn'’t Just Barrow.Sir?

49:02.560 --> 49:05.321
I'’ve just been thinking
how much more interesting
this great house is

49:05.356 --> 49:07.047
than our silly little film.

49:07.082 --> 49:09.325
Don'’t call me "sir."

49:10.671 --> 49:12.673
Is there anything
I can do?

49:12.708 --> 49:15.090
Well, not unless you'’ve got
some ideas for my next career.

49:15.124 --> 49:17.402
Um, I don'’t understand.

49:18.783 --> 49:21.303
Films have been mime until now.

49:21.337 --> 49:23.132
Mime with music.

49:23.167 --> 49:26.170
Now with the new talkies,
they'’re gonna be about acting.

49:26.204 --> 49:28.206
They won'’t want us.

49:28.241 --> 49:31.278
They'’ll hire real actors
from the theater, and...

49:31.313 --> 49:32.555
we'’ll be finished.

49:32.590 --> 49:34.419
But you'’ve got
a good voice.

49:34.454 --> 49:37.008
There may be
new faces coming in,

49:37.043 --> 49:40.253
but the public
won'’t want to say goodbye
to all their old favorites.

49:40.287 --> 49:41.530
I hope you'’re right.

49:43.152 --> 49:44.395
Sir.

49:58.374 --> 50:00.100
That'’s the Duke...

50:00.135 --> 50:02.516
That'’s the Duke
of Westminster'’s yacht.

50:30.475 --> 50:32.408
Let me sum up.

50:32.443 --> 50:34.583
In the years since 1864,

50:34.617 --> 50:37.206
the late
Marquis de Montmirail
made four wills.

50:37.241 --> 50:39.553
In every one,
he refers to the fact

50:39.588 --> 50:41.141
that he gave
the Villa des Colombes

50:41.176 --> 50:44.662
to the now Dowager Countess
of Grantham in 1865.

50:44.696 --> 50:47.699
I brought the originals.
I will leave copies.

50:47.734 --> 50:50.530
Then clearly
it wasn'’t something
that slipped his mind.

50:50.564 --> 50:53.636
He meant to do this thing,
and he stuck by his decision.
I feel better for that.

50:53.671 --> 50:55.811
She must have had
some hold over him.

50:55.845 --> 50:57.778
She must have blackmailed him.

50:57.813 --> 50:59.366
Maman, this is
a foolish response.

50:59.401 --> 51:00.850
We shall challenge it in court.

51:00.885 --> 51:03.612
On what basis, madame?

51:03.646 --> 51:06.442
You have other houses.
There'’s no question of hardship.

51:06.477 --> 51:09.204
Your husband bought the villa
and disposed of it

51:09.238 --> 51:11.309
before he even met you.

51:11.344 --> 51:15.175
My advice would be to surrender
the property without delay.

51:19.766 --> 51:21.147
Thank you so much.

51:21.181 --> 51:23.701
Do you mean to accept this?Of course.

51:23.735 --> 51:26.738
My father
made me sole executor,
Lord Grantham.

51:26.773 --> 51:30.294
I like to think it was
because he trusted me
to carry out his wishes.

51:30.328 --> 51:32.779
Then why did you
invite us here?

51:32.813 --> 51:34.712
Because I was curious
to meet you.

51:34.746 --> 51:39.165
My father and your mother
spent a week together
in October 1864.

51:39.199 --> 51:40.235
B--

51:44.204 --> 51:46.724
And I was born in July 1865.

51:46.758 --> 51:48.795
Precisely.

51:48.829 --> 51:52.281
I think that'’s the key
to why he gave her the villa
one month later.

51:52.316 --> 51:53.869
In gratitude
for your birth.

51:55.284 --> 51:59.668
In short, I believe you and I
have a great deal in common.

52:14.372 --> 52:16.857
-We should thank
old Lady Grantham.
-Of course.

52:16.892 --> 52:20.171
At least now we know that
for her to have the villa

52:20.206 --> 52:22.932
wasn'’t a random choice
or a foolish mistake,

52:22.967 --> 52:25.866
but a decision
that was firmly endorsed
over many years.

52:25.901 --> 52:29.698
Feels funny, in a way,
to know my own child is
part of this golden circle

52:29.732 --> 52:32.183
where, because of your blood,
lovely things happen.

52:32.218 --> 52:35.428
Just as Mary will have Downton
and we will have Brompton.

52:35.462 --> 52:36.739
Yes, but they'’re
working estates.

52:36.774 --> 52:38.845
This place was made
for laughter and fun.

52:38.879 --> 52:42.435
Wouldn'’t Sybil have been
pleased for her daughter?

52:43.712 --> 52:46.542
And encouraged her to use it
for the good of others?

52:46.577 --> 52:48.786
Yes, I think she would.

52:48.820 --> 52:50.305
Then let'’s do the same.

52:51.513 --> 52:54.688
I long
to bring Sybbie here.
She'’ll love it.

52:54.723 --> 52:56.449
Look at that view.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.832
Don'’t you feel grateful
we'’re alive?

53:01.799 --> 53:03.283
I love you, you know.

53:04.284 --> 53:06.907
In a way I thought
I'’d never love again.

53:06.942 --> 53:08.944
And I love you.

53:08.978 --> 53:11.222
So that'’s all right.

53:14.708 --> 53:16.952
Shall we go back in?
The water is...

53:16.986 --> 53:18.678
They look very happy together.

53:18.712 --> 53:20.749
So they should.Mm.

53:20.783 --> 53:23.683
It'’s thrilling for Sybbie,
for all of them.

53:23.717 --> 53:25.719
I like the idea
of Tom and Lucy

53:25.754 --> 53:28.239
hosting a gathering here
every summer,

53:28.274 --> 53:30.862
until it becomes
a family tradition.

53:32.726 --> 53:34.694
The sun
has made me sleepy.

53:34.728 --> 53:38.663
If you'’ll excuse me,
I think I'’ll have a nap
before dinner.

53:39.457 --> 53:40.976
You look a little tired too.

53:41.010 --> 53:43.392
Why don'’t you do the same?

53:43.427 --> 53:44.669
I won'’t be too long.

53:48.846 --> 53:51.055
She'’s right.
You do look tired.

53:51.089 --> 53:54.852
Never sure how helpful it is
for people to point it out.Oh, I'’m sorry.

53:56.819 --> 53:59.857
Keep writing,
whatever happens.

53:59.891 --> 54:03.757
Mama, if something
is troubling you,
please just say it.

54:03.792 --> 54:05.759
No, no, it'’s nothing,
honestly.

54:07.899 --> 54:09.832
I'’ve had to change

54:09.867 --> 54:12.283
the setting of
the dinner table again,

54:12.318 --> 54:14.078
but I think they'’ve got
the hang of ironing

54:14.112 --> 54:15.907
His Lordship'’s shirts
at last.

54:15.942 --> 54:18.013
You should'’ve
let me do that.

54:18.047 --> 54:20.878
They must be very grateful
for your help, Mr. Carson.Well, maybe.

54:20.912 --> 54:22.742
When I showed them
how to do it,

54:22.776 --> 54:25.538
they certainly
spoke a lot of French
very loud and very fast.

54:26.470 --> 54:28.644
Is anything settled yet?

54:28.679 --> 54:31.785
It seems the villa
now belongs to Miss Sybbie.

54:31.820 --> 54:33.960
Lucky girl.

54:33.994 --> 54:36.928
-Do you envy her, Miss Baxter?
-I'’m not a big believer in envy,
Mr. Bates.

54:36.963 --> 54:39.793
I know what I want,
and I can live without

54:39.828 --> 54:41.692
a villa
in the South of France.

54:41.726 --> 54:43.901
What do you want,
Miss Baxter?

54:43.935 --> 54:46.904
Oh, come now, Mr. Carson.
We all know what
Miss Baxter wants.

54:46.938 --> 54:49.562
Her affections are
very firmly engaged.

54:49.596 --> 54:51.080
Not engaged.

54:51.115 --> 54:55.464
Not engaged in that way,
perhaps, but thoroughly taken.

54:55.499 --> 54:58.018
Are we discussing
Mr. Molesley?

54:58.053 --> 54:59.675
We are.

54:59.710 --> 55:02.368
But suppose he never
steps up to the mark?

55:03.438 --> 55:05.509
Then I will be a spinster.

55:05.543 --> 55:07.580
You'’d never marry
anyone else?

55:09.064 --> 55:11.411
It took me long enough
to find him.

55:11.446 --> 55:12.757
Madame.

55:18.832 --> 55:21.559
I don'’t know how long
he'’s thought about it,

55:21.594 --> 55:23.768
but once
he checked the dates,
he was sure.

55:23.803 --> 55:27.047
I was born
exactly nine months
after-- and I quote--

55:27.082 --> 55:29.429
the "idyllic interlude"
they spent together.

55:29.464 --> 55:31.638
And he gave her the villa
soon after I was born.

55:31.673 --> 55:33.502
I'’m sure
that'’s all coincidence.

55:33.537 --> 55:35.815
Are you? It would
explain the mystery.

55:35.849 --> 55:37.748
Your father
loved you very much.

55:37.782 --> 55:40.889
But Rosamund'’s the one
who looks like him.

55:43.098 --> 55:44.789
I hope this helps, milady.

55:44.824 --> 55:46.066
Thank you, Baxter.

55:46.101 --> 55:47.827
Good night.Good night.

55:47.861 --> 55:49.518
What'’s that for?
Are you all right?

55:49.553 --> 55:50.830
Just a bit of heartburn.
I'’m fine.

55:53.764 --> 55:56.560
What will happen
if the story gets out,
do you think?

55:56.594 --> 55:58.700
I suppose Carson
will hand in his notice.

55:58.734 --> 56:01.461
Don'’t be ridiculous.
You'’re the least French person
I'’ve ever met.

56:01.496 --> 56:02.842
You don'’t even like garlic.

56:02.876 --> 56:04.947
That'’s not exactly
cast-iron proof.

56:08.744 --> 56:10.953
How have they managed
this so fast?

56:10.988 --> 56:14.163
Because time is money.
The problem now is,
what are the actors gonna say?

56:14.198 --> 56:16.200
What do you mean?Well, I write
the lines for them,

56:16.234 --> 56:18.478
but they don'’t always
stick to the text,

56:18.513 --> 56:21.205
and often we can'’t really
remember what the actors
have actually said.

56:21.239 --> 56:23.587
Why not let
Mr. Molesley help?

56:23.621 --> 56:26.486
Why? What could he do?Well, he'’s the village
schoolmaster,

56:26.521 --> 56:28.523
and I know
he can lip-read.

56:28.557 --> 56:31.111
I'’m sure he could
sort something out.That'’s certainly true.

56:31.146 --> 56:33.976
And he'’s been here
every day as it is
and watched all the scenes.

56:34.011 --> 56:36.427
Right, Mr. Barber. I'’m ready.

56:36.462 --> 56:39.430
Bring on the thespians.

56:39.465 --> 56:41.190
Oh.

56:45.471 --> 56:48.439
That looks
very professional, milady,

56:48.474 --> 56:49.647
if you don'’t mind my saying.

56:49.682 --> 56:51.477
It'’s the new Speed Reflex.

56:51.511 --> 56:53.237
You can see the image
before you take it.

56:53.271 --> 56:55.446
Oh, what will they
think of next?

56:55.481 --> 56:57.172
How are you
getting on downstairs?

56:57.206 --> 56:59.070
All right, I think, sir.

56:59.105 --> 57:02.073
Although, they'’re very French,
the French, aren'’t they?

57:02.108 --> 57:04.938
-I suppose they'’re bound to be.
-I suppose they are.

57:04.973 --> 57:06.940
Poor things.

57:06.975 --> 57:09.840
Now, this is pretty good,
but, Carson, could you
move the telephone?

57:09.874 --> 57:12.014
It spoils it a bit.

57:13.188 --> 57:15.880
It'’s lovely to see you
enjoying your labors.

57:15.915 --> 57:17.675
It feels good to have a...

57:17.710 --> 57:19.781
Foothold
in the real world again?

57:19.815 --> 57:21.955
Something like that, yes.Mm.

57:23.681 --> 57:25.096
Oh, my goodness.

57:25.131 --> 57:26.166
What is it?

57:27.236 --> 57:28.755
Look.

57:35.693 --> 57:37.108
Who is she?

57:37.143 --> 57:40.629
That is the Lady Grantham
I first went to work for

57:40.664 --> 57:43.045
as a young hallboy
wet behind the ears.

57:43.080 --> 57:44.806
Granny?

57:44.840 --> 57:46.808
Heavens.

57:46.842 --> 57:49.500
Thank you, Carson.
Could you leave us a moment?

57:51.778 --> 57:53.021
What does it say?

57:53.055 --> 57:56.576
"Violette, mon adorée."

57:58.958 --> 58:00.511
Gosh.

58:03.549 --> 58:06.034
Mary had a little lamb.

58:06.068 --> 58:08.864
Its fleece was white as snow.

58:08.899 --> 58:10.659
Right, Mr. Stubbins,
are you ready?

58:10.694 --> 58:12.592
As ready as I can be,
Mr. Barber,

58:12.627 --> 58:15.319
when I'’ve not controlled
the soundproofing or the set.

58:15.353 --> 58:17.252
If we could have
Mr. Dexter, please.

58:17.286 --> 58:18.529
Guy?

58:19.634 --> 58:20.876
Where are the lines?

58:20.911 --> 58:22.257
I'’m so sorry.

58:22.291 --> 58:24.190
No, no, no.Oh.

58:24.224 --> 58:26.986
Thank you.And here.

58:27.020 --> 58:29.022
Now, time your speech
to match the film.

58:29.057 --> 58:31.335
No, no, no.
Don'’t lean in.

58:31.369 --> 58:33.717
And try not
to move your head.

58:33.751 --> 58:34.994
All right.

58:35.028 --> 58:38.066
Ring the bell for silence!

58:40.206 --> 58:41.621
And...

58:41.656 --> 58:43.140
Rolling sound.

58:54.669 --> 58:56.325
"Well, if it isn'’t Lady Anne.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.845
I thought
you might find me.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.538
No one can keep a secret
these days.

59:03.263 --> 59:06.266
May I remind you
it'’s my future to throw away.

59:09.753 --> 59:11.962
No, wait. Don'’t go."

59:13.032 --> 59:14.965
-Cut.

59:19.763 --> 59:20.936
Well done.

59:21.661 --> 59:23.145
Miss Dalgleish.

59:23.180 --> 59:24.284
Ready.

59:34.985 --> 59:37.332
And action.

59:40.646 --> 59:42.199
"I knew where you'’d be.

59:42.233 --> 59:44.373
I only came to--"

59:44.408 --> 59:46.134
Hang on a minute.
I turned me head round there.

59:46.168 --> 59:47.756
You...Oh, y-yes.

59:47.791 --> 59:50.414
I-I'’ve written a line
to cover that. You see?

59:50.448 --> 59:53.659
"I'’ve only come to stop you
throwing away your future."

59:53.693 --> 59:55.937
You... Y-You turn back
on "future."

59:55.971 --> 59:57.110
Right.

1:00:00.355 --> 1:00:02.944
-And action.

1:00:05.325 --> 1:00:07.742
"I knew where you'’d be.

1:00:07.776 --> 1:00:10.814
-I'’ve only come to stop you
throwing away your future."
-Louder, Miss Dalgleish!

1:00:12.367 --> 1:00:15.163
"I can'’t stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:18.856
-Um, I must..."
-Cut. Cut.

1:00:18.891 --> 1:00:20.409
Thank you, Myrna.
Could I have a moment?

1:00:22.998 --> 1:00:24.759
-You all right?

1:00:24.793 --> 1:00:26.899
Now what? Mr. Stubbins?

1:00:26.933 --> 1:00:30.109
Oh, I am here
to record sound, Mr. Barber,
not to perform miracles.

1:00:30.143 --> 1:00:32.421
The Lady Anne Erskine
she is not.

1:00:32.456 --> 1:00:35.252
Couldn'’t she just learn
the accent a bit better
and do it again?

1:00:35.286 --> 1:00:38.289
People spend lives
trying to learn this particular
accent and failing.

1:00:38.324 --> 1:00:40.153
George Bernard Shaw
wrote a play about it.

1:00:40.188 --> 1:00:42.846
Uh, you could do it,
milady.

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:45.193
You saw how
Mr. Dexter managed.

1:00:45.227 --> 1:00:46.435
It can'’t be that hard.

1:00:46.470 --> 1:00:48.368
But I couldn'’t.What?

1:00:48.403 --> 1:00:50.094
You couldn'’t
do the accent?

1:00:50.129 --> 1:00:52.027
I think you could.
I think you do.

1:00:52.062 --> 1:00:54.961
But I'’m not an actress.Well, is Myrna an actress?

1:00:54.996 --> 1:00:56.791
Are you keen to see
her Hedda Gabler?

1:00:56.825 --> 1:00:57.861
Even so.

1:00:57.895 --> 1:00:59.794
Look, just-just try it.

1:00:59.828 --> 1:01:01.796
If you can'’t do it,
we'’ll shut down,
possibly for good.

1:01:01.830 --> 1:01:04.730
If you can,
you'’ll allow us
to keep going.

1:01:05.903 --> 1:01:07.353
Please.

1:01:07.387 --> 1:01:09.320
How do we deal
with Miss Dalgleish?

1:01:09.355 --> 1:01:11.357
Oh, right now, um,
get her back upstairs.

1:01:11.391 --> 1:01:13.980
We need to know
if this is gonna work.Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1:01:14.015 --> 1:01:16.327
I'’ll do that.Mm-hmm.

1:01:16.362 --> 1:01:17.984
Miss Dalgleish?

1:01:23.334 --> 1:01:25.716
Here are the lines, milady.
Thank you.

1:01:25.751 --> 1:01:28.029
I don'’t know how I get myself
into these things.

1:01:36.244 --> 1:01:38.246
"I knew where you'’d be.

1:01:39.592 --> 1:01:42.250
I'’ve only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1:01:42.284 --> 1:01:46.323
I can'’t stay
and watch you ruin yourself.

1:01:46.357 --> 1:01:49.015
I must."

1:01:49.050 --> 1:01:50.085
And cut.

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:51.777
Play them together.

1:02:01.269 --> 1:02:03.374
Well, if it isn'’t Lady Anne.

1:02:03.409 --> 1:02:05.066
I thought you might find me.

1:02:05.100 --> 1:02:07.137
No one can keep a secret
these days.

1:02:07.171 --> 1:02:09.346
I knew where you'’d be.

1:02:09.380 --> 1:02:12.004
I'’ve only come to stop you
throwing away your future.

1:02:12.038 --> 1:02:14.731
May I remind you
it'’s my future to throw away.

1:02:16.525 --> 1:02:19.563
I can'’t stay and watch you
ruin yourself.

1:02:19.597 --> 1:02:21.254
No, wait.

1:02:21.289 --> 1:02:22.773
Don'’t go.

1:02:23.532 --> 1:02:25.155
I must.

1:02:27.951 --> 1:02:31.161
Oh.

1:02:42.172 --> 1:02:44.519
I do hope
that was a prop.

1:02:45.900 --> 1:02:47.349
When was it painted?

1:02:47.384 --> 1:02:49.282
And why was she
his adored one?

1:02:49.317 --> 1:02:51.284
Because she granted
the ultimate favor?

1:02:51.319 --> 1:02:54.391
They were only together
for a few days.
Does it sound likely?

1:02:54.425 --> 1:02:58.153
And it'’s just a coincidence
that Papa was born
nine months later?

1:02:58.188 --> 1:02:59.948
I expect,
when she got home,

1:02:59.983 --> 1:03:02.295
your grandpapa was
jolly pleased to see her.

1:03:02.330 --> 1:03:04.297
-Anyway, what'’s clear is

1:03:04.332 --> 1:03:06.886
Monsieur de Montmirail
was madly in love with her.

1:03:06.921 --> 1:03:09.337
-When did he marry?
-Oh, I know that.
I looked him up.

1:03:09.371 --> 1:03:12.961
He married in 1870,
five years after
Robert was born.

1:03:12.996 --> 1:03:15.584
And the present marquis
arrived in 1873.

1:03:15.619 --> 1:03:18.173
So the villa was
a sort of parting gift
to your grandmother

1:03:18.208 --> 1:03:19.934
before he looked around
for a wife.

1:03:19.968 --> 1:03:22.557
-That'’s what it sounds like.
-Evidently.

1:03:25.974 --> 1:03:27.596
I'’m gonna sound him out.

1:03:27.631 --> 1:03:29.978
About Mrs. Patmore.You can'’t.

1:03:30.013 --> 1:03:31.635
I can.

1:03:31.669 --> 1:03:33.533
You know she'’s got
a house of her own.

1:03:33.568 --> 1:03:35.052
You know she'’s lonely.

1:03:35.087 --> 1:03:37.503
It'’s a solution
for all of us.

1:03:37.537 --> 1:03:39.850
You look very conspiratorial.

1:03:39.885 --> 1:03:42.922
We were talking
about Mrs. Patmore
and how much she likes you.

1:03:42.957 --> 1:03:44.337
Does she indeed?

1:03:44.372 --> 1:03:46.270
Well, I like her.

1:03:46.305 --> 1:03:48.065
She'’s a fine woman.She is.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:50.550
But I worry sometimes
that she'’s lonely.

1:03:50.585 --> 1:03:52.242
She'’s got her own cottage,
of course,

1:03:52.276 --> 1:03:54.106
but I think she'’d like
some company in it.

1:03:55.901 --> 1:03:58.627
I know what you'’re thinking,
but the answer'’s no.

1:03:58.662 --> 1:04:00.560
You'’ve always said
you admired her.

1:04:00.595 --> 1:04:03.149
And so I do.
But I couldn'’t live off a woman.

1:04:03.184 --> 1:04:04.910
It wouldn'’t be right.

1:04:04.944 --> 1:04:07.119
Even if she wanted it?Even then.

1:04:07.153 --> 1:04:09.949
There are things that are right
and there are things
that are wrong,

1:04:09.984 --> 1:04:11.261
and I can'’t change that.

1:04:15.334 --> 1:04:18.406
Thank you for taking it on.
I owe you a great deal.

1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.339
-Is everything in order?
-Well--

1:04:20.373 --> 1:04:23.066
Once we'’ve recorded sound for
the scenes we'’ve already shot,

1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:25.447
we'’ll need new material
for what'’s left...

1:04:25.482 --> 1:04:26.966
Ooh.

1:04:28.519 --> 1:04:30.280
M-May I have a word, Mr. Barber?

1:04:30.314 --> 1:04:31.660
Of course.

1:04:31.695 --> 1:04:33.455
I-I'’ve been through
all the dialogue cards

1:04:33.490 --> 1:04:35.595
that w-would'’ve been shown
if the picture were silent,

1:04:35.630 --> 1:04:38.046
and I'’ve started
to sketch out scenes

1:04:38.081 --> 1:04:40.014
that would cover
the needs of the plot.

1:04:40.048 --> 1:04:42.913
-You mean you'’ve written a play?
-Well, I'’ve started one.

1:04:42.948 --> 1:04:44.501
Could I read these scenes?Of course.

1:04:44.535 --> 1:04:47.090
And if you'’re content,
I'’ll do the rest.

1:04:49.230 --> 1:04:51.991
Am I bound
by the plot synopsis?

1:04:53.510 --> 1:04:56.651
For instance,
when she finally
casts him off,

1:04:56.685 --> 1:04:59.654
might it not be better
with a big romantic climax?

1:04:59.688 --> 1:05:00.724
I don'’t understand.

1:05:00.758 --> 1:05:02.381
Well, Bill Benson'’s

1:05:02.415 --> 1:05:05.108
about to throw away his life
on the tables.

1:05:05.142 --> 1:05:09.526
Alone, hollow and without hope.

1:05:11.217 --> 1:05:13.495
Then suddenly he lifts his face
and sees Anne standing there,

1:05:13.530 --> 1:05:15.463
tall, serene, graceful,

1:05:15.497 --> 1:05:20.606
her eyes shining
with unshed tears.

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:22.711
On an impulse,
he snatches back his money.

1:05:22.746 --> 1:05:25.128
Rien ne va plus!

1:05:25.162 --> 1:05:26.543
The wheel spins.

1:05:35.241 --> 1:05:39.659
And every last thing he owns
would have gone.

1:05:39.694 --> 1:05:41.420
But no.

1:05:41.454 --> 1:05:45.665
Her love,
her beauty have saved him.

1:05:46.804 --> 1:05:50.187
She takes his hand,
and they walk away.

1:05:51.395 --> 1:05:52.983
Together.

1:05:53.018 --> 1:05:54.157
The end.

1:05:55.572 --> 1:05:57.401
I think
I'’m going to cry.

1:05:57.436 --> 1:06:02.061
Mr. Molesley,
please finish the script
however you think best

1:06:02.096 --> 1:06:04.201
-and bring it to me.
-Right.

1:06:07.756 --> 1:06:10.035
-You say he used to work here?
-Yes.

1:06:10.069 --> 1:06:11.726
He was a footman.

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:14.384
But we weren'’t aware
of his hidden talents.

1:06:18.215 --> 1:06:21.046
Poor Carson.
He must be cooking
in those heavy clothes.

1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:23.703
Isn'’t there
a lighter version
he could wear?

1:06:23.738 --> 1:06:25.809
I believe so.Thank you, monsieur,

1:06:25.843 --> 1:06:28.812
but we English are never too hot
to wear the correct attire.

1:06:28.846 --> 1:06:31.470
I'’ve invited
some friends tomorrow

1:06:31.504 --> 1:06:33.713
to say goodbye
and introduce all of you.

1:06:33.748 --> 1:06:36.371
But the presence
of your butler reminds me
that we are now your guests

1:06:36.406 --> 1:06:38.132
and I should have
asked your permission.

1:06:38.166 --> 1:06:39.823
Oh, please.

1:06:39.857 --> 1:06:43.206
Let us drink to
your fortunate granddaughter,
Sybil Branson.

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.104
-To Sybbie.
-Sybbie.

1:06:45.139 --> 1:06:47.555
I wish she were here.
I should like to meet her.

1:06:47.589 --> 1:06:49.764
I hope you will one day.
She'’s a lovely girl.

1:06:49.798 --> 1:06:52.353
It'’s nice to hear
a stepmother talk like that.

1:06:52.387 --> 1:06:54.424
You must be pleased
the way things
have turned out.

1:06:54.458 --> 1:06:56.288
When people you love
have a stroke of luck,

1:06:56.322 --> 1:06:58.255
it'’s almost better
than being lucky yourself.

1:06:58.290 --> 1:06:59.498
Almost, but not quite.

1:06:59.532 --> 1:07:00.637
Yeah.

1:07:05.228 --> 1:07:07.264
You know the miniatures
in the library?

1:07:08.472 --> 1:07:12.304
One of them is of Granny,
and it'’s engraved on the side.

1:07:15.548 --> 1:07:16.653
I'’ve seen it.

1:07:18.137 --> 1:07:20.346
I have been obliged
to see it there

1:07:20.381 --> 1:07:21.761
for more than half a century.

1:07:22.728 --> 1:07:25.248
But he forbade me to move it.

1:07:25.282 --> 1:07:26.663
He made me swear.

1:07:31.392 --> 1:07:33.808
Any more news
from Mr. Talbot?

1:07:33.842 --> 1:07:35.775
Not since the cable
I showed you.

1:07:35.810 --> 1:07:37.777
You must be missing him,
milady.

1:07:37.812 --> 1:07:39.469
I just hope he misses me.

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:44.819
His Lordship
will be home soon.

1:07:44.853 --> 1:07:47.373
I'’m afraid
he'’ll be in for a shock.

1:07:47.408 --> 1:07:49.755
Have you enjoyed
the filming?

1:07:49.789 --> 1:07:53.207
In a way. I like
Mr. Barber and Mr. Dexter

1:07:53.241 --> 1:07:56.417
and watching
how a film is made,
but...

1:07:56.451 --> 1:07:58.522
...I feel
a bit let down too.

1:07:58.557 --> 1:08:00.283
By Miss Dalgleish?

1:08:00.317 --> 1:08:02.285
It sounds stupid, but...

1:08:02.319 --> 1:08:03.872
I thought
we might become friends.

1:08:05.253 --> 1:08:07.669
They say it can be a mistake
to meet your favorite stars.

1:08:07.704 --> 1:08:10.258
In this case,
they'’d be right.

to be done.

And the more hard work involved,

1:08:51.403 --> 1:08:52.852
Ah, he'’s too fast.

1:08:52.887 --> 1:08:54.716
Oh, no.

1:08:56.546 --> 1:08:59.618
Where'’s the ball, eh?
He'’s gone.

1:09:00.584 --> 1:09:02.448
Ah, good hit.

1:09:02.483 --> 1:09:03.967
Yes. How'’s that?

1:09:04.001 --> 1:09:07.488
George should be in bed,
or at least on his way there.

1:09:07.522 --> 1:09:09.386
Do you have other children?

1:09:09.421 --> 1:09:12.665
A daughter, Caroline,
with my second husband.

1:09:12.700 --> 1:09:16.428
George'’s father was killed
in a car accident
seven years ago,

1:09:16.462 --> 1:09:18.361
on the day
George was born.

1:09:18.395 --> 1:09:21.329
He held the baby in his arms
and died on the way home.

1:09:21.364 --> 1:09:23.159
My God.

1:09:24.953 --> 1:09:26.576
What was he like?

1:09:26.610 --> 1:09:28.509
He was perfect, really.

1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:32.651
As handsome as a prince
in a fairy tale.

1:09:32.685 --> 1:09:37.173
Moral, strong, full of dreams,
determined to do his bit.

1:09:38.450 --> 1:09:40.624
Do you miss him?Of course.

1:09:40.659 --> 1:09:44.732
Although I sometimes wonder
what life would'’ve made of him
if he'’d lived.

1:09:44.766 --> 1:09:46.665
In a way...

1:09:47.597 --> 1:09:49.461
In a way?

1:09:49.495 --> 1:09:52.222
I was going to say, in a way,
you remind me of him.

1:09:52.257 --> 1:09:54.811
Although I couldn'’t
tell you why.I'’m flattered.

1:09:54.845 --> 1:09:57.020
What about your present husband?

1:09:57.054 --> 1:09:59.436
Oh, Henry'’s
much more pragmatic.

1:09:59.471 --> 1:10:02.301
There are no dreams
about him. He'’s a doer.

1:10:02.336 --> 1:10:05.408
And he must test
his powers of endurance
from morning till night.

1:10:05.442 --> 1:10:07.582
But he'’s a good workmate.

1:10:07.617 --> 1:10:08.963
Is he handsome too?

1:10:08.997 --> 1:10:11.517
Oh, yes.

1:10:11.552 --> 1:10:13.347
I like them handsome.

1:10:14.589 --> 1:10:17.592
But there'’s trouble
in paradise?

1:10:17.627 --> 1:10:19.007
You don'’t need me
to tell you

1:10:19.042 --> 1:10:22.873
that marriage is a novel,
not a short story.

1:10:22.908 --> 1:10:25.980
Full of plot twists
along the way.

1:10:26.014 --> 1:10:28.983
Suppose it comes down to
whether or not you love him.

1:10:29.017 --> 1:10:32.262
Really, Mr. Barber?
Is this because you
work in the films?

1:10:33.815 --> 1:10:37.509
I think I'’ve said more
than enough for one evening.

1:10:37.543 --> 1:10:40.615
I hope you will warmly welcome
our successors of the villa.

1:10:40.650 --> 1:10:43.894
And with the Bransons, perhaps
you'’ll see Lord Grantham,

1:10:43.929 --> 1:10:46.449
whom I think
I may now call my...

1:10:46.483 --> 1:10:47.484
my good friend.

Because he thinks
I'’m his brother.

For a second there, I thought
he was going to say it.

1:11:12.406 --> 1:11:14.787
You can'’t talk like that.
Your father loved you.
Enough.

1:11:14.822 --> 1:11:16.755
-But it'’s not enough, is it?

1:11:16.789 --> 1:11:19.344
Not when I might be
a lifelong fraud.

1:11:19.378 --> 1:11:23.071
A Frenchman'’s bastard
who usurped the role
of the proper heir.

1:11:23.106 --> 1:11:25.350
But that would'’ve
been Matthew'’s father,

1:11:25.384 --> 1:11:26.799
and now Matthew'’s son
will inherit,

1:11:26.834 --> 1:11:29.388

does it make
in the long run?

You know, I'’ve enjoyed
watching you work out here.

1:11:50.167 --> 1:11:52.480
I had a sort of flash of
what you'’ve been missing.

1:11:52.515 --> 1:11:55.966
It seems I'’m not
quite ready to say goodbye
to that side of my life.

1:11:56.001 --> 1:11:58.037
I'’ve looked at the miniature,

Lady Hexham,
and, uh, you'’re right.

1:11:59.832 --> 1:12:01.731

1:12:01.765 --> 1:12:04.630
Please take it home
for your grandmother.
It'’s hers anyway.

1:12:26.825 --> 1:12:28.585
Excuse me a moment.

1:12:32.727 --> 1:12:34.798
What is it?

1:12:34.833 --> 1:12:37.767
Whatever your secret may be,
isn'’t it a good time

1:12:52.609 --> 1:12:55.060
Yeah, it'’s nothing

1:12:55.094 --> 1:12:58.063
That was beautiful.It was...

1:12:58.097 --> 1:13:00.755
You'’ve been so gracious,
but it'’s time for us to go home.

1:13:00.790 --> 1:13:02.757
We'’ll be gone, too, before long.

1:13:02.792 --> 1:13:05.450
As you know,
the contents of the house
already belong to your mother.

No. His wishes are clear.

Well, our lawyers
can manage the rest.

1:13:19.222 --> 1:13:21.707
I know it'’s late,
but can we go for a walk?

1:13:21.742 --> 1:13:23.709
Yes, of course.

1:13:23.744 --> 1:13:25.608
Monsieur,
we are in your debt.

a last treat before illness
took over our lives?

1:14:23.769 --> 1:14:26.496

1:14:45.066 --> 1:14:47.206

I can'’t bear it.If I can bear it, you can.

1:14:49.795 --> 1:14:52.211
Remember, I loved you
from the start.

1:14:53.143 --> 1:14:55.214
I loved you
before you loved me.

1:14:55.249 --> 1:14:57.147
I'’ve always
been ashamed of that.

1:14:57.182 --> 1:14:59.771
Don'’t be. I had money.
You needed it.

1:15:01.358 --> 1:15:02.670
And then love came.

1:15:03.982 --> 1:15:06.156
And we have been happy,
haven'’t we?

1:15:06.191 --> 1:15:07.226
Oh, darling.

1:15:13.612 --> 1:15:15.649
You have been
everything to me.

1:15:16.753 --> 1:15:18.168
Everything.

1:15:18.203 --> 1:15:22.690
And I hope
I can be everything
for a while yet.

1:15:22.725 --> 1:15:24.140
Now...

1:15:25.762 --> 1:15:27.695
we must make
an early start tomorrow...Oh.

1:15:27.730 --> 1:15:29.214
...and it'’s hours
past my bedtime.

1:15:31.078 --> 1:15:32.700
Oh, dear.

1:15:32.735 --> 1:15:35.254
Hope we can
still get tickets
on the Blue Train.

1:15:35.289 --> 1:15:37.118
Oh, yes.

1:16:04.318 --> 1:16:06.941
Why is the camera
in a padded cell?

1:16:06.976 --> 1:16:08.805
Anyone would think
it was a lunatic.

1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:10.255
Well, it'’s certainly
unpredictable.

1:16:10.289 --> 1:16:13.051

pick up any noise

1:16:13.085 --> 1:16:16.123
unless I have

contains the sound

mime but don'’t talk.

1:16:36.695 --> 1:16:38.663

-We only want to hear Lady Mary.

1:17:33.165 --> 1:17:35.098
It'’s just very difficult for me
because she'’s right in me ear!

1:17:35.133 --> 1:17:37.169
-And you'’ve got me
coming out a bush!
-I understand.

1:17:37.204 --> 1:17:38.239
Reset, please.

1:17:40.207 --> 1:17:41.415
Bill.

1:17:41.449 --> 1:17:43.141
You came back.

1:17:43.175 --> 1:17:44.832
I always come back.
-Bloody hell!

1:17:44.867 --> 1:17:46.696
-There'’s no need to swear!
-Myrna, I'’m sorry.

1:17:46.731 --> 1:17:48.422
Right, that'’s it.
I'’ve had enough.Myrna.

1:17:48.456 --> 1:17:51.045
-You take your hands off me.
Get out of my way!
-Myrna, darling!

1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:52.115
No!

1:17:55.049 --> 1:17:56.464
Now what?

1:17:56.499 --> 1:17:58.777
I knew she'’d be trouble
right from the start.

1:17:58.812 --> 1:18:00.434
She'’s rude. She's surly.

1:18:00.468 --> 1:18:02.885
True, but now
she also feels humiliated.

1:18:02.919 --> 1:18:05.715
Moving her mouth
while Lady Mary'’s voice
comes out of it.

1:18:05.750 --> 1:18:09.098
And this is
her first sound film.
What happens to her next?

1:18:09.132 --> 1:18:10.858
I suppose
her career'’s finished.

1:18:10.893 --> 1:18:12.895
I suppose a lot of them
are finished.

1:18:12.929 --> 1:18:15.207
The point is they'’ve got
to get her back to work.

1:18:15.242 --> 1:18:17.520
But what if she won'’t come?
They can'’t force her.

1:18:17.554 --> 1:18:19.764
Why don'’t you two
have a go?

1:18:19.798 --> 1:18:22.698
You know how
to reason with her.
They don'’t.

1:18:26.563 --> 1:18:29.118
Myrna, darling,
please come down.

1:18:29.152 --> 1:18:31.189
We can'’t do anything
without you.

1:18:31.223 --> 1:18:33.329
You can talk without me!

1:18:33.363 --> 1:18:34.295
Just go away!

1:18:36.573 --> 1:18:37.954
Milady.

1:18:39.956 --> 1:18:42.165
I think it would be
a good idea to let the maids

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:44.340
see if they can make her
comfortable, Mr. Barber.

1:18:44.374 --> 1:18:46.100
All right.
If you think so, yeah.

1:18:46.135 --> 1:18:48.206

1:18:50.104 --> 1:18:51.450

1:18:51.485 --> 1:18:53.418
We understand
what you'’re going through.

1:18:54.315 --> 1:18:57.008
That'’s true,
and you know it.

1:19:01.564 --> 1:19:04.498
I'’m not going down just
so they can humiliate me
and laugh at me.

1:19:04.532 --> 1:19:06.224
They won'’t do that.Oh?

1:19:06.258 --> 1:19:08.122
You should'’ve heard them
at every premiere.

1:19:08.157 --> 1:19:10.884
"Don'’t speak.
Don'’t open your mouth."
They despise me.

1:19:10.918 --> 1:19:13.265
Why didn'’t you take
elocution lessons?
Lots of people do.

1:19:13.300 --> 1:19:15.129
I tried. I couldn'’t get it.

1:19:15.164 --> 1:19:16.821
Couldn'’t get the knack.

1:19:16.855 --> 1:19:19.340
Something'’s upset you
since the day you got here.

1:19:19.375 --> 1:19:21.135
What is it?It'’s this.

1:19:21.170 --> 1:19:23.551
I knew I was finished the moment
I saw The Jazz Singer.

1:19:23.586 --> 1:19:25.968
It'’s been like a sword
hanging over me.

1:19:26.002 --> 1:19:29.109
I thought maybe I had
a few more films ahead of me,
but this one will be me last.

1:19:29.143 --> 1:19:31.421
You don'’t know that.
You look good
in the bits I'’ve seen.

1:19:31.456 --> 1:19:33.078
And how do I sound, eh?

1:19:33.113 --> 1:19:35.115
But the fact is I'’m washed up,
as the Yanks say.

1:19:35.149 --> 1:19:37.255
I'’m yesterday's news.

1:19:39.395 --> 1:19:41.052
Come on, lady.

1:19:41.086 --> 1:19:43.123
You'’re not talking
to your fan club now.

1:19:43.157 --> 1:19:44.365
What?

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.816
You'’re famous,
beautiful and rich.

1:19:46.851 --> 1:19:49.267
So what if
your film career is over?

1:19:49.301 --> 1:19:51.510
There'’s any number of things
you can do.

1:19:51.545 --> 1:19:53.581
Now, dust yourself off.

1:19:53.616 --> 1:19:56.274
And while you'’re at it,
try being polite to the people
who serve you.

1:19:56.308 --> 1:19:58.069
Come on, Daisy.

1:19:58.103 --> 1:20:00.899
You'’re one of us,
not one of them.

1:20:00.934 --> 1:20:03.108
Just remember it.

1:20:03.143 --> 1:20:04.489
Now, chop-chop.

1:20:04.523 --> 1:20:06.146
Straighten your hair,
and let'’s get going.

1:20:08.665 --> 1:20:11.323
How you doing in there?
She'’s almost ready, Mr. Barber.

1:20:12.462 --> 1:20:14.982
You are, aren'’t you,
Miss Dalgleish?

1:20:20.470 --> 1:20:22.507
I had a sister
just like you once.

1:20:22.541 --> 1:20:25.130
I miss her. Every day.

1:20:25.165 --> 1:20:27.167
You remind me of her.

1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:32.241
She died of the Spanish flu
in 1919.

1:20:32.275 --> 1:20:35.865
Didn'’t think
it would touch our family,
but you never know, do you?

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:39.938
Shall we go?

1:20:48.326 --> 1:20:50.155
I'’m not worth it.

1:20:50.190 --> 1:20:51.847
You'’re worth it to me.

1:20:58.094 --> 1:20:59.647
Rien ne va plus.

1:21:05.999 --> 1:21:07.966
It seems you'’re my savior.

1:21:08.001 --> 1:21:10.210
And I intend
to remain your savior

1:21:10.244 --> 1:21:12.350
for a very long time to come.

1:21:12.971 --> 1:21:14.007
Mary?

1:21:15.491 --> 1:21:17.079
What on earth is going on?

1:21:17.113 --> 1:21:20.185
-Cut!
-Oh, no!

1:21:22.981 --> 1:21:24.949
So you put them to rights?

1:21:24.983 --> 1:21:27.503
I think I can say so
without fear of contradiction.

1:21:27.537 --> 1:21:31.265
I left them in no doubt
as to how things are done
when they are done properly.

1:21:31.300 --> 1:21:32.404
Eh, Mr. Bates?

1:21:32.439 --> 1:21:34.303
Uh, you made
your feelings clear.

1:21:34.337 --> 1:21:36.443
They certainly know
what it is to deal with
an English butler.

1:21:36.477 --> 1:21:39.101
-Oh, get your coats.

1:21:40.965 --> 1:21:43.243
Watching you,
it took me back to the plays

1:21:43.277 --> 1:21:45.279
you three used to put on
in the attic.

1:21:45.314 --> 1:21:47.937
Except there'’s rather more
riding on it this time.

1:21:47.972 --> 1:21:50.422
I don'’t mean to be harsh, but
how do we know she'’s any good?

1:21:50.457 --> 1:21:51.665
Oh, she'’s absolutely superb.

1:21:53.425 --> 1:21:55.945
I showed Granny
Papa'’s telegram, Tom,

1:21:55.980 --> 1:21:57.291
but you ought to
look in.

1:21:57.326 --> 1:21:58.741
Perhaps
we should go up now.

1:21:58.775 --> 1:22:00.260
Maybe you'’re right.

1:22:00.294 --> 1:22:02.400
It ought to be you.

1:22:02.434 --> 1:22:04.436
You can give her
the miniature.

1:22:07.129 --> 1:22:08.371
What miniature is this?

1:22:08.406 --> 1:22:10.753
It'’s a long story.

1:22:10.787 --> 1:22:14.205
Talkies must be good news
for the actors
in the West End theaters.

1:22:14.239 --> 1:22:16.690
Good news for them,
bad news for me.

1:22:18.140 --> 1:22:19.727
Death by microphone, eh, Guy?

1:22:19.762 --> 1:22:22.592
Our business has always
been a game of chance.

1:22:22.627 --> 1:22:24.422
Well said.

1:22:27.597 --> 1:22:31.567
I have an idea,
Miss Dalgleish,
which might just help.

1:22:31.601 --> 1:22:34.742
I'’m taking your mama
to the hospital first thing
in the morning.

1:22:34.777 --> 1:22:36.675
I'’m dreading it, of course.

1:22:36.710 --> 1:22:39.230
But that'’s for you to hear,
not her.

1:22:39.264 --> 1:22:41.784
I thought they might
put up more of a fight.

1:22:41.818 --> 1:22:43.130
So did we.

1:22:43.165 --> 1:22:45.339
The mother wanted to.

1:22:45.374 --> 1:22:47.583
And then Edith
found this.

1:22:47.617 --> 1:22:49.965
It'’s inscribed to you
on the side.

1:22:50.689 --> 1:22:52.277
Oh.

1:23:02.494 --> 1:23:04.427
I...

1:23:04.462 --> 1:23:09.122
I suppose they think
something improper
went on between us.

1:23:09.156 --> 1:23:11.434
I suppose
everyone does.Oh, no.

1:23:11.469 --> 1:23:13.574
I-I wouldn'’t say that.

1:23:14.437 --> 1:23:17.509
You'’re such a bad liar,
Tom.

1:23:17.544 --> 1:23:21.686
I'’d never have got anywhere if
I were as rotten a liar as you.

1:23:23.584 --> 1:23:26.415
We'’re going to try and meet
at the villa every year.

1:23:26.449 --> 1:23:28.658
The whole family together,
in the summer.

1:23:28.693 --> 1:23:30.798
Won'’t it be too hot?

1:23:30.833 --> 1:23:33.767
We hope you'’ll
come and find out.Oh, no.

1:23:33.801 --> 1:23:37.495
No. That'’s-That's
all over for me.

1:23:37.529 --> 1:23:39.635
Never mind.

1:23:39.669 --> 1:23:43.466
I am happy to have
known you, Tom.

1:23:43.501 --> 1:23:46.228
I think we got on pretty well
in the end, don'’t you?

1:23:46.262 --> 1:23:48.092
I think we did.

1:23:48.126 --> 1:23:49.576
In the end.

1:23:49.610 --> 1:23:52.165
You weren'’t quite what
we had in mind for Sybil,

1:23:52.199 --> 1:23:54.098
but we got past it.

1:23:54.132 --> 1:23:55.685
And that'’s life,
isn'’t it?

1:23:55.720 --> 1:23:58.240
Getting past
the unexpected.

1:23:59.275 --> 1:24:01.346
And perhaps
learning from it,

1:24:01.381 --> 1:24:03.279
which I think we can say
we'’ve done.

1:24:03.314 --> 1:24:05.868
You'’ve been a good friend to me
through the years, Violet.

1:24:05.902 --> 1:24:07.628
I hope I'’ve been
a friend to you.

1:24:07.663 --> 1:24:10.528
And now you'’re settled.

1:24:10.562 --> 1:24:14.601
Maud'’s back in the family,
and everyone'’s happy.

1:24:18.674 --> 1:24:20.296
When was the miniature painted?

1:24:20.848 --> 1:24:22.264
Did you sit for it?

1:24:22.298 --> 1:24:26.233
No, we...
we went for a walk

1:24:26.268 --> 1:24:28.235
in the town one day,

1:24:28.270 --> 1:24:31.514
and there was a shop
where a man was
taking photographs.

1:24:31.549 --> 1:24:33.861
Yeah, I remember '’cause
he was the first photographer

1:24:33.896 --> 1:24:35.518
I'’d ever seen.

1:24:35.553 --> 1:24:37.210
They must have copied it
from that.

1:24:37.244 --> 1:24:39.557
Montmirail
sent it to me in London

1:24:39.591 --> 1:24:41.869
with a silly
scribbled letter.

1:24:41.904 --> 1:24:45.149
I sent it back.

1:24:45.183 --> 1:24:46.702
Of course,
I should have burned it.

1:24:48.290 --> 1:24:49.636
We'’ll leave you to rest.

1:24:49.670 --> 1:24:52.259
But we wanted to say
how very grateful we are.

1:24:52.294 --> 1:24:53.398
And Sybbie will be too.

1:24:53.433 --> 1:24:55.642
It'’s a beautiful place.

1:24:57.540 --> 1:24:59.232
That I do remember.

1:25:18.975 --> 1:25:20.425
Time for bed.

1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:23.290
Yes, I'’ll just
tidy these up.

1:25:23.325 --> 1:25:24.533
What are they?

1:25:24.567 --> 1:25:27.294
The letters
of Monsieur de Montmirail.

1:25:27.329 --> 1:25:29.745
Oh.
They'’re clearly labeled?

1:25:29.779 --> 1:25:32.541
I'’m afraid so.

1:25:32.575 --> 1:25:35.647
So she was lying when she said
she remembers nothing.

1:25:35.682 --> 1:25:38.788
"Lying" is a harsh word.
Maybe she pushed it to
the back of her mind.

1:25:38.823 --> 1:25:41.205
I don'’t believe it stayed there
with all the fuss going on.

1:25:41.239 --> 1:25:43.483
I'’ll ask when I
go and see her.Hmm.

1:26:06.333 --> 1:26:08.404
Is this the way
to find Mr. Barrow?

1:26:08.439 --> 1:26:10.165
Left.

1:26:16.032 --> 1:26:18.483
Oh.So this is where
you hide.

1:26:18.518 --> 1:26:20.382
Can I help
with anything, sir?

1:26:20.416 --> 1:26:22.522
Well, you can certainly help
by not calling me "sir."

1:26:23.937 --> 1:26:26.836
I'’m not sure what Mr. Carson
would make of

1:26:26.871 --> 1:26:30.288
my receiving a visit
from an upstairs guest,
Mr. Dexter.

1:26:30.323 --> 1:26:32.670
Well, Mr. Carson
isn'’t in charge now.

1:26:32.704 --> 1:26:34.223
You are.

1:26:34.258 --> 1:26:37.364
Suppose someone comes in.
What would they say?

1:26:37.399 --> 1:26:39.021
I don'’t care.

1:26:39.055 --> 1:26:41.403
I'’ve lived in America
for ten years now.

1:26:41.437 --> 1:26:43.577
I don'’t believe
in that stuff anymore.

1:26:44.544 --> 1:26:46.684
Please, call me Guy.

1:26:49.031 --> 1:26:50.826
What'’s your real name?

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:53.380
Quentin.

1:26:53.415 --> 1:26:55.382
Quentin Sidebotham.

1:26:56.556 --> 1:26:58.282
That was a good decision.

1:27:00.491 --> 1:27:02.286
Do you know
what you'’re doing next?

1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:04.495
I don'’t think anybody does.

1:27:04.529 --> 1:27:07.256
I shall go home
and await developments.

1:27:07.291 --> 1:27:10.846
I might call Clive Brook
or Charlie Chaplin,
see what they think.

1:27:11.812 --> 1:27:13.607
You know Charlie Chaplin?

1:27:13.642 --> 1:27:15.989
Well, he'’s a little wild for me,
but yeah, I-I know him.

1:27:16.023 --> 1:27:18.612
Hollywood gets
some bad publicity,

1:27:18.647 --> 1:27:22.720
but I live in a place
called Hancock Park,
and it'’s... it's pretty nice.

1:27:23.997 --> 1:27:26.241
I can believe it.

1:27:27.483 --> 1:27:29.968
Well, why don'’t you come
and see for yourself?

1:27:34.387 --> 1:27:36.009
What?

1:27:36.043 --> 1:27:38.287
I mean it.

1:27:40.082 --> 1:27:41.842
I travel a lot for my work,

1:27:41.877 --> 1:27:45.398
and I don'’t have a wife
to look after me, so...

1:27:46.606 --> 1:27:48.401
you could do it.

1:27:49.609 --> 1:27:51.335
I'’d be your valet?

1:27:51.369 --> 1:27:53.923
More than that.

1:27:53.958 --> 1:27:56.823
You'’d run the house
and organize our journeys,

1:27:56.857 --> 1:27:58.065
make me comfortable.

1:27:59.032 --> 1:28:01.483
Make us both comfortable.

1:28:01.517 --> 1:28:04.486
Of course, if my career folds,
then we'’d have to
think again, but...

1:28:04.520 --> 1:28:06.419
Your career won'’t fold.

1:28:06.453 --> 1:28:07.489
Good.

1:28:08.628 --> 1:28:09.732
Well...

1:28:11.389 --> 1:28:13.426
you let me know
when you'’ve...

1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:15.082
come to a decision.

1:28:23.470 --> 1:28:26.335
Right.
I have everything I need.

1:28:26.370 --> 1:28:29.580
I will come up to the house
with the results
as soon as I have them.

1:28:29.614 --> 1:28:31.513
But do you feel optimistic?

1:28:31.547 --> 1:28:33.480
Robert, there'’s no point
in that sort of talk.

1:28:33.515 --> 1:28:37.450
Lady Grantham knows too much
to pull the wool over her eyes.

1:28:37.484 --> 1:28:40.556
But even if everything
is as bad as it could be,

1:28:40.591 --> 1:28:41.799
there'’s still a surgery.

1:28:41.833 --> 1:28:43.594
Let'’s take it
one step at a time.

1:28:43.628 --> 1:28:45.078
Oh, God.

1:28:46.528 --> 1:28:50.083
Robert doesn'’t see it, but
things could be a lot worse.

1:28:50.117 --> 1:28:53.535
How many have to face
this kind of thing feeling
they'’ve wasted their lives?

1:28:53.569 --> 1:28:55.778
I don'’t.

1:28:55.813 --> 1:28:57.780
Not at all.

1:29:00.818 --> 1:29:02.578
How are things
at the farm?

1:29:02.613 --> 1:29:03.855
Cramped.

1:29:03.890 --> 1:29:05.374
Poor Mr. Mason.

1:29:05.409 --> 1:29:08.619
He'’d be so unhappy
to hear you say it.

1:29:08.653 --> 1:29:10.793
He'’s been talking
about you lately.

1:29:10.828 --> 1:29:12.070
Oh, yes?

1:29:12.105 --> 1:29:14.141
Saying what a fine woman
you are

1:29:14.176 --> 1:29:16.454
and how much
he admires you.

1:29:16.489 --> 1:29:18.042
Does he? Really?

1:29:18.076 --> 1:29:20.078
But he won'’t take it
any further.

1:29:20.113 --> 1:29:21.701
Why not?

1:29:21.735 --> 1:29:24.186
Because he can'’t ask you
to live at the farm

1:29:24.220 --> 1:29:26.499
and he couldn'’t be
dependent on a woman.

1:29:26.533 --> 1:29:28.086
Oh, couldn'’t he?

1:29:28.121 --> 1:29:30.088
We'’ll see about that.

1:29:34.161 --> 1:29:36.198
Look what we'’ve found,

1:29:36.232 --> 1:29:38.614
when I was going
through Violet'’s things.

1:29:39.822 --> 1:29:42.066
"The letters of
the Marquis de Montmirail."

1:29:42.100 --> 1:29:44.137
Oh, dear. It doesn'’t
look good for Papa

1:29:44.171 --> 1:29:46.484
if she felt the need
to keep it a secret.

1:29:46.519 --> 1:29:48.417
Well, let'’s not
jump the gun.

1:29:48.452 --> 1:29:50.833
-I'’m so sorry. Are you
in the middle of something?
-No, no.

1:29:50.868 --> 1:29:53.491
Could I speak to you alone
for a moment, please?Yes.

1:29:54.492 --> 1:29:55.804
So what happens now?

1:29:55.838 --> 1:29:57.737
Well, I thought
we could read them together.

1:29:57.771 --> 1:30:01.016
Bertie, you and I can do it and
report back what they contain.

1:30:01.050 --> 1:30:03.190
And we'’ll break the news
to Papa.

1:30:10.163 --> 1:30:11.854
What is it?

1:30:12.579 --> 1:30:13.994
You have to help me.

1:30:14.029 --> 1:30:16.445
We'’re just about to film
our last set piece,

1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:18.861
the-the dinner when Benson
realizes he must give her up

1:30:18.896 --> 1:30:20.138
and rushes off to London.

1:30:20.173 --> 1:30:21.761
I know. I'’ve just
been learning it.

1:30:21.795 --> 1:30:24.246
Molesley'’s done
a wonderful job.

1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:27.042
I told you the extras were
fed up with not being paid,

1:30:27.076 --> 1:30:28.492
and I don'’t blame them,

1:30:28.526 --> 1:30:30.217
but I'’m still waiting
for the money.

1:30:30.252 --> 1:30:32.944
Well, they won'’t do
anything too drastic.Won'’t they?

1:30:32.979 --> 1:30:35.257
They say they'’re not
coming into work.

1:30:35.291 --> 1:30:37.017
But how can I help?

1:30:38.156 --> 1:30:42.644
Could your servants stand in?

1:30:43.748 --> 1:30:45.681
You'’re welcome
to ask them.

1:30:52.619 --> 1:30:54.656
Is there something else,
Mr. Barber?

1:30:56.278 --> 1:30:58.694
I could never have got through
any of this without you.

1:30:59.695 --> 1:31:01.904
If that'’s true,
then I'’m glad.

1:31:05.218 --> 1:31:06.909
May I kiss you?

1:31:10.775 --> 1:31:11.811
No.

1:31:12.708 --> 1:31:14.123
Don'’t you want to?

1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:18.231
I'’m afraid I'm too
old-fashioned to believe

1:31:18.265 --> 1:31:21.890
that what I want is
the only thing that matters.

1:31:23.236 --> 1:31:26.584
Have I offended you?Not at all.

1:31:26.619 --> 1:31:29.138
Nothing is nicer
for an old married woman

1:31:29.173 --> 1:31:31.624
than to find she'’s still
an object of desire.

1:31:31.658 --> 1:31:34.834
Well, you better not tell
your husband when he gets back.

1:31:34.868 --> 1:31:36.870
He might, uh,
hit me on the nose.

1:31:36.905 --> 1:31:38.251
Mm, wouldn'’t that
be thrilling?

1:31:38.285 --> 1:31:41.012
Two gorgeous men
fighting for my favors.

1:31:43.981 --> 1:31:45.776
You rang, milady?

1:31:45.810 --> 1:31:49.158
-So she'’d kept his letters?
-Seemingly. Every one.

1:31:49.193 --> 1:31:50.850
I won'’t ask
what she had to hide,

1:31:50.884 --> 1:31:52.265
in case you tell me
the answer.

1:31:52.299 --> 1:31:54.647
Well, most of them
are rather sad.

1:31:54.681 --> 1:31:58.064
There was clearly no love lost
between him and his wife.

1:31:58.098 --> 1:32:01.550
But what do they tell us
about the days they spent
together in France?

1:32:01.585 --> 1:32:03.656
I'’m afraid that they didn't
write to each other then.

1:32:03.690 --> 1:32:06.797
So we still have no proof
of what really happened.

1:32:06.831 --> 1:32:09.558
I suppose that is where
the mystery resides.

1:32:09.593 --> 1:32:11.698
I'’ll come
and see Violet tomorrow.

1:32:11.733 --> 1:32:13.907
Should I do it?

1:32:13.942 --> 1:32:15.599
No.

1:32:15.633 --> 1:32:18.325
You'’re what the lawyers call
"an interested party."

1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:20.535
I'’m not.

1:32:22.019 --> 1:32:24.642
You mean we'’d be
up there on the screen

1:32:24.677 --> 1:32:26.023
with Miss Dalgleish
and Mr. Dexter?

1:32:26.057 --> 1:32:27.714
Are you sure?

1:32:27.749 --> 1:32:29.751
That'’s exactly what I mean.Well, I'’ll do it.

1:32:29.785 --> 1:32:31.304
Mm, so will Mr. Carson.

1:32:31.338 --> 1:32:33.168
Mr. Molesley
will want to join in.

1:32:33.202 --> 1:32:35.204
How many do you need?Uh, we need ten.

1:32:35.239 --> 1:32:37.275
Miss Denker,
are you up for it?Certainly not.

1:32:37.310 --> 1:32:39.277
I want to keep an eye
on Her Ladyship.

1:32:39.312 --> 1:32:41.107
What about Mr. Mason?I could always ask.

1:32:41.141 --> 1:32:42.971
No, hurry to the farm
and ask him now.

1:32:43.005 --> 1:32:45.318
And they'’ve got costumes
for us?

1:32:45.352 --> 1:32:48.183
They'’ll need time to fit them,
so go upstairs to wardrobe
before the end of the day.

1:32:48.217 --> 1:32:50.116
-What about servants?

1:32:50.150 --> 1:32:52.256
Who'’s going
to wait on us?

1:32:52.290 --> 1:32:54.051
Well, I was thinking
we could use Albert.

1:32:54.085 --> 1:32:56.294
Would I be serving
Miss Dalgleish?

1:32:56.329 --> 1:32:58.158
I suppose so.Oh, well...

1:32:58.193 --> 1:33:00.954
Right, let'’s get back
to work, please!

1:33:00.989 --> 1:33:02.680
All right, come on now.Come along.

1:33:04.924 --> 1:33:07.927
Filming must be the slowest
occupation known to man.

1:33:07.961 --> 1:33:09.929
It makes a glacier
look impatient.

1:33:09.963 --> 1:33:12.172
I suppose Robert'’s in hell.

1:33:12.207 --> 1:33:15.831
He was longing for it all to be
over by the time they got back.

1:33:15.866 --> 1:33:18.662
You could ease his pain
if you wish.

1:33:20.111 --> 1:33:22.804
We found the letters
of Monsieur de Montmirail.

1:33:22.838 --> 1:33:26.048
But Robert still doesn'’t have
the answer he needs.

1:33:27.671 --> 1:33:29.776
I won'’t pretend
not to understand you.

1:33:29.811 --> 1:33:31.675
Did they tell you
about the miniature?

1:33:31.709 --> 1:33:33.297
What'’s its significance?

1:33:33.331 --> 1:33:34.919
Well, could you fetch it?

1:33:34.954 --> 1:33:37.335
It'’s in the bottom
right-hand drawer.

1:33:37.370 --> 1:33:41.063
If you open it at the back,
you'’ll find the letter
he sent with it.

1:33:42.030 --> 1:33:46.172
It'’s still there
after all this time.

1:33:47.035 --> 1:33:48.726
Could you read it?

1:33:54.352 --> 1:33:57.183
"Chère Violette,
we have missed the chance

1:33:57.217 --> 1:33:59.081
to know perfect love.

1:34:00.704 --> 1:34:05.087
But we still can if you would
only change your mind."

1:34:06.848 --> 1:34:08.850
Why didn'’t you just tell us?

1:34:10.265 --> 1:34:12.198
There was nothing to tell.

1:34:13.337 --> 1:34:14.821
Nothing happened.

1:34:14.856 --> 1:34:17.099
Apart from years
of being pestered.

1:34:17.134 --> 1:34:18.342
Well, no.

1:34:18.376 --> 1:34:20.482
That'’s not quite right.

1:34:20.516 --> 1:34:22.277
Then what is?

1:34:22.311 --> 1:34:24.866
I never saw him after that.

1:34:24.900 --> 1:34:26.730
I knew I'’d have given in.

1:34:26.764 --> 1:34:31.217
If I'’d been tested again,
I would have failed.

1:34:32.252 --> 1:34:33.944
Oh.

1:34:33.978 --> 1:34:37.016
I was a fool for love
in those days.

1:34:37.050 --> 1:34:39.846
A few years later,
we went to Russia,

1:34:39.881 --> 1:34:42.297
and I got into
terrible trouble.

1:34:42.331 --> 1:34:44.368
Well, I nearly did.

1:34:44.402 --> 1:34:46.991
With Prince Kuragin.
Yes, I know.

1:34:47.026 --> 1:34:49.269
How did you avoid it
with the marquis?

1:34:49.304 --> 1:34:51.237
I can'’t think.

1:34:51.271 --> 1:34:53.929
He was the most attractive man
I'’d ever met

1:34:53.964 --> 1:34:56.242
in my life.

1:34:56.276 --> 1:34:58.175
But I hadn'’t
long been married,

1:34:58.209 --> 1:35:02.075
and it must have seemed a shame,
you know, to spoil that.

1:35:03.249 --> 1:35:05.389
I wish you'’d said all this.

1:35:05.423 --> 1:35:08.530
I didn'’t want you to think
my life had been a fraud,
when it hasn'’t.

1:35:08.564 --> 1:35:11.395
I was happy
with Robert'’s father.

1:35:11.429 --> 1:35:14.778
Well...
...happy enough
in that English way,

1:35:14.812 --> 1:35:19.368
when you never talk
about anything,

1:35:19.403 --> 1:35:21.819
but you trust each other.

1:35:21.854 --> 1:35:25.754
If they'’d put Kuragin
and Montmirail together,

1:35:25.789 --> 1:35:29.413
I would have come out
as some sort of scarlet woman.

1:35:30.897 --> 1:35:33.003
You don'’t seem
very scarlet to me.

1:35:33.037 --> 1:35:37.179
Well, I'’m trusting you
to make sure

1:35:37.214 --> 1:35:39.388
that'’s not how I'm remembered.

1:35:40.493 --> 1:35:43.945
Well, the next earl
will be Matthew'’s son,

1:35:43.979 --> 1:35:47.327
my grandson,
your great-grandson.

1:35:47.362 --> 1:35:50.192
I'’ll do my best
to see he values you.

1:35:50.227 --> 1:35:52.539
I know you will.

1:35:52.574 --> 1:35:56.302
I know I can trust you
to do the right thing.

1:35:56.336 --> 1:35:58.511
That'’s very generous of you.

1:35:58.545 --> 1:36:01.134
Well, because we'’ve had
our tussles, you and I.

1:36:01.169 --> 1:36:05.207
Well, it'’s true,
but I'’m glad you came
to Downton.

1:36:05.242 --> 1:36:08.590
I'’d never known anyone
whose opinion I could trust,

1:36:08.624 --> 1:36:12.352
you know,
to be morally right,
not for years.

1:36:12.387 --> 1:36:14.803
Well, not since
my mother died.

1:36:15.597 --> 1:36:17.564
You must have wondered
why I asked you

1:36:17.599 --> 1:36:19.152
to go through my papers.

1:36:19.187 --> 1:36:20.809
I did rather.

1:36:20.844 --> 1:36:25.296
When I think about
that world of long ago,

1:36:25.331 --> 1:36:30.301
when I... I was a girl
in my first crinoline...

1:36:32.372 --> 1:36:36.894
in those moments, I feel
as if I'’ve been transported

1:36:36.929 --> 1:36:39.966
to a different planet.

1:36:40.864 --> 1:36:42.382
And so you have been.

1:36:43.521 --> 1:36:46.317
Like every human being
who lives long enough.

1:36:46.352 --> 1:36:48.872
And I have.
Lived long enough.

1:36:48.906 --> 1:36:52.392
-Oh, I didn'’t mean it like that.

1:37:05.198 --> 1:37:07.580
I'’m sorry,
but I just couldn'’t wait.

1:37:07.614 --> 1:37:10.203
It'’s all right.
Nothing happened.

1:37:10.238 --> 1:37:12.516
You'’re your father's son.

1:37:16.313 --> 1:37:18.453
I can'’t pretend
I'’m not relieved.

1:37:18.487 --> 1:37:20.938
I can'’t pretend
I'’m not insulted.

1:37:22.388 --> 1:37:24.666
Why do you think
he gave you the villa

1:37:24.700 --> 1:37:27.151
if it has nothing to do
with my birth?

1:37:27.186 --> 1:37:29.913
I think it had everything
to do with your birth.

1:37:29.947 --> 1:37:32.605
When you were born,
it sent a message

1:37:32.639 --> 1:37:36.022
that what he wanted
was never going to happen

1:37:36.057 --> 1:37:38.231
and it was time to move on.

1:37:38.266 --> 1:37:41.027
He never loved his wife
as he loved you.

1:37:41.062 --> 1:37:42.442
The villa proves that.

1:37:43.547 --> 1:37:44.582
Well...

1:37:46.481 --> 1:37:48.655
that'’s not for me to say.

1:37:55.421 --> 1:37:56.594
Right.

1:37:57.664 --> 1:37:58.873
Ooh.

1:38:04.948 --> 1:38:07.536
I looked through
the final scenes.
I'’m impressed.

1:38:07.571 --> 1:38:11.161
Does this kind of work
appeal to you, writing plays
for the screen?

1:38:11.678 --> 1:38:12.990
What, you-you mean...

1:38:13.025 --> 1:38:14.509
Well, say, four a year.

1:38:14.543 --> 1:38:16.994
I'’d send you the book
or short story I was keen on

1:38:17.029 --> 1:38:18.616
with my notes
and suggestions.

1:38:18.651 --> 1:38:22.310
Um, I would pay 700 guineas
against a thousand.

1:38:22.344 --> 1:38:24.519
-Mr. Barber.
-Sorry?

1:38:24.553 --> 1:38:26.728
Uh, you'’d get 700
for writing the script.

1:38:26.762 --> 1:38:29.627
That would rise to a thousand
if the film is made.

1:38:33.010 --> 1:38:34.563
For each script?

1:38:39.292 --> 1:38:41.674
I feel like the queen.

1:38:41.708 --> 1:38:44.746
Well, I don'’t envy her if these
corsets are anything to go by.

1:38:49.026 --> 1:38:51.718
This is absurd.Cheer up.

1:38:51.753 --> 1:38:54.307
After all, you should be
used to the costume.

1:38:55.550 --> 1:38:57.517
We'’ve put
the names on the places,

1:38:57.552 --> 1:38:59.761
so, please, all of you,
find your chair and sit.

1:38:59.795 --> 1:39:02.660
Uh, Mr. Carson, you will be
playing Lord Pumphrey

1:39:02.695 --> 1:39:05.077
at the head of the table.

1:39:05.111 --> 1:39:07.355
Seems odd
to be sitting in here.

1:39:07.389 --> 1:39:09.426
You'’ve spent
enough time standing.

1:39:12.118 --> 1:39:14.396
I'’d say you've spent
long enough.

1:39:14.431 --> 1:39:16.536
You may be right,
Mr. Dexter.

1:39:16.571 --> 1:39:20.471
Tell me, did your offer mean
what I think it did?

1:39:20.506 --> 1:39:23.267
It can mean as little
or as much as you like.

1:39:24.372 --> 1:39:26.305
I'’d like it to mean
a great deal.

1:39:27.271 --> 1:39:29.239
Then you'’re in luck.

1:39:37.419 --> 1:39:39.697
-Mrs. Hughes.
-Thank you.

1:39:43.184 --> 1:39:44.357
This is you.

1:39:44.392 --> 1:39:46.532
I don'’t recognize you.

1:39:46.566 --> 1:39:48.154
And...

1:39:49.397 --> 1:39:51.813
-Oh, no, no, really.

1:39:51.847 --> 1:39:53.573
Please, we'’re not here.

1:39:53.608 --> 1:39:56.611
Milord, if-if you could make
your way up behind the camera.

1:39:57.612 --> 1:39:58.578
Thank you.

1:40:03.238 --> 1:40:04.239
Oh.

1:40:05.792 --> 1:40:08.692
I look like something
to scare the crows.

1:40:08.726 --> 1:40:11.384
Nonsense. You'’re
a picture of elegance.

1:40:11.419 --> 1:40:14.353
Now, sit down here
and have something warming.

1:40:15.457 --> 1:40:17.804
I thought it were
just colored water.

1:40:17.839 --> 1:40:19.668
Well, so it is
for the others.

1:40:19.703 --> 1:40:23.465
For us, I'’ve smuggled in
something nice.

1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:25.709
Oh, you'’re right.
This is good.

1:40:27.573 --> 1:40:30.093
Don'’t the young
couple look nice together?

1:40:30.127 --> 1:40:32.509
It must be wonderful
to feel you'’re helping them.

1:40:32.543 --> 1:40:34.511
I'’d like to do more.

1:40:34.545 --> 1:40:36.478
Well, this is what
I want to talk about.

1:40:45.763 --> 1:40:48.145
You'’re not nervous?

1:40:48.180 --> 1:40:49.733
Well, how should
a man feel

1:40:49.767 --> 1:40:53.081
when all his dreams
have come true?

1:40:53.116 --> 1:40:54.703
All your dreams?

1:40:54.738 --> 1:40:57.810
I-I know, but, you see,
Miss Baxter...

1:40:57.844 --> 1:40:59.191
Phyllis.

1:40:59.881 --> 1:41:01.572
Phyllis.

1:41:01.607 --> 1:41:04.161
I felt ashamed.

1:41:04.196 --> 1:41:06.129
The best I could offer
was a poor life

1:41:06.163 --> 1:41:08.131
on a schoolmaster'’s
salary.

1:41:08.165 --> 1:41:09.649
I'’d have taken it.

1:41:11.858 --> 1:41:14.344
But now you won'’t have to.

1:41:14.378 --> 1:41:17.519
I'’m gonna write plays
to be made into films.

1:41:17.554 --> 1:41:19.763
For Mr. Barber?

1:41:19.797 --> 1:41:21.903
For Mr. Barber now,
but who knows what'’ll happen
if I'’m any good at it.

1:41:21.937 --> 1:41:24.457
Uh, it'’s gonna
be talking films from now on.

1:41:24.492 --> 1:41:26.287
Oh, what the blazes?

1:41:29.428 --> 1:41:31.188
For the first time,

1:41:31.223 --> 1:41:34.260
I can offer
a decent, prosperous life.

1:41:35.503 --> 1:41:37.470
For the both of us.

1:41:38.195 --> 1:41:40.232
So what do you say?

1:41:41.957 --> 1:41:44.201
Are you not going to kneel?

1:41:47.860 --> 1:41:50.380
Do you want me to?I think so.

1:41:50.966 --> 1:41:52.658
It'’ll never happen again.

1:41:54.625 --> 1:41:56.144
Right then, um...

1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:01.598
Will you marry me,
Miss Baxter?

1:42:02.254 --> 1:42:04.118
I mean, Phyllis.

1:42:08.467 --> 1:42:10.917
I jolly well will,
Mr. Molesley.

1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:23.206
Congratulations, dear.

1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:25.449
Well done,
Mr. Molesley.

1:42:25.484 --> 1:42:27.865
Well done, Mr. Molesley.

1:42:29.453 --> 1:42:32.180
Settle down, everyone, please.
Let'’s go for a first take.

1:42:32.215 --> 1:42:33.388
Say it again.

1:42:33.906 --> 1:42:35.666
Barkis is willing.

1:42:35.701 --> 1:42:37.599
Oh, Mr. Mason.

1:42:37.634 --> 1:42:40.292
And you'’ll be content to live
in my little cottage?

1:42:40.326 --> 1:42:41.879
Unless you think it'’s wrong.

1:42:41.914 --> 1:42:44.365
I most certainly do not.

1:42:44.399 --> 1:42:46.194
And now the young ones
can have the farm?

1:42:46.229 --> 1:42:47.609
I'’ll surrender the lease.

1:42:47.644 --> 1:42:49.508
Oh, well,
I'’ll drink to that.

1:42:50.716 --> 1:42:52.752
-Right, and if we can...
-Remember!

1:42:52.787 --> 1:42:56.687
Clarity, diction,
and keep your heads still.

1:42:56.722 --> 1:42:58.310
Thank you.Thank you.

1:42:58.344 --> 1:43:00.484
Roll the camera.

1:43:01.416 --> 1:43:02.866
And action.

1:43:06.663 --> 1:43:08.285
Where are you going?

1:43:08.320 --> 1:43:09.597
Back to London.

1:43:10.701 --> 1:43:12.600
What? You can'’t.

1:43:12.634 --> 1:43:14.360
I can and I must.

1:43:14.395 --> 1:43:16.638
If I stay, darling Anne,

1:43:16.673 --> 1:43:18.502
I'’ll destroy you
along with myself.

1:43:18.537 --> 1:43:19.572
Can'’t you see?

1:43:20.746 --> 1:43:22.472
Oh.

1:43:22.506 --> 1:43:24.439
We'’ll fight it together.No, we won'’t.

1:43:24.474 --> 1:43:27.442
I'’m the worthless one.
I'’m the exile.
I'’m the lost soul.

1:43:27.477 --> 1:43:28.581
Now let me go!

1:43:35.726 --> 1:43:37.694
Bill, please wait.

1:43:37.728 --> 1:43:40.006
-He'’s broken her heart.

1:43:40.041 --> 1:43:41.422
Chap'’s a cad.

1:43:41.456 --> 1:43:42.595
And cut.

1:43:47.704 --> 1:43:50.776
Bravo.

1:43:54.573 --> 1:43:55.815
Bravo.

1:43:59.992 --> 1:44:02.063
The buffet in the hall
is ready, milady.

1:44:02.097 --> 1:44:03.961
Thank you, Barrow.

1:44:05.411 --> 1:44:07.965
Milady, I wonder
if I might have a word.

1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:09.415
Of course.

1:44:10.589 --> 1:44:12.729
I'’d like
to hand in my notice.

1:44:12.763 --> 1:44:14.972
Oh.

1:44:15.007 --> 1:44:17.492
Well, I know you haven'’t
always been happy here.

1:44:17.527 --> 1:44:20.978
Oh, it'’s not that, milady.
I'’ve had good years at Downton.

1:44:21.013 --> 1:44:22.877
But I'’ve formed a sort of--

1:44:22.911 --> 1:44:25.017
Well, I'’m not sure
what it is, really.

1:44:25.051 --> 1:44:27.985
A working friendship
with Mr. Dexter.

1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.022
Guy?That'’s it, milady.

1:44:30.056 --> 1:44:31.644
And we mean
to travel together.

1:44:31.679 --> 1:44:34.026
He'’ll make films,
and I'’ll look after him.

1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:37.719
I'’ll be his dresser,
as the film people put it.

1:44:37.754 --> 1:44:39.721
And if I'’m right...

1:44:39.756 --> 1:44:42.414
...then it'’s
the nearest I'’ve come

1:44:42.448 --> 1:44:45.348
to the offer
of an honest way of life.

1:44:47.350 --> 1:44:49.421
You don'’t need
to explain, Barrow.

1:44:49.455 --> 1:44:51.492
I wish you well.

1:44:51.526 --> 1:44:54.702
And I hope you'’ll be as happy
as our cruel world allows.

1:44:55.806 --> 1:44:57.843
Thank you, milady.

1:45:07.991 --> 1:45:10.027
Well?

1:45:10.994 --> 1:45:12.823
I'’ve done it.

1:45:13.652 --> 1:45:14.687
Good.

1:45:19.589 --> 1:45:21.763
We'’re all wondering if you'll
miss your acting career.

1:45:21.798 --> 1:45:24.490
Oh, please say yes.
Come up to London.
We'’ll find you a part.

1:45:24.525 --> 1:45:28.839
No, thank you.
I'’ve enjoyed it, in fact,
but once will suffice.

1:45:28.874 --> 1:45:31.670
Can I help you,
Miss Dalgleish?

1:45:31.704 --> 1:45:33.706
Um, I'’d love some of that ham,

1:45:33.741 --> 1:45:37.123
if you can reach it,
and a little sauce.

1:45:37.158 --> 1:45:40.368
What'’s happened to your voice?

1:45:40.403 --> 1:45:42.439
What do you mean?Well, you'’ve lost
the ghastly...

1:45:46.029 --> 1:45:48.065
Of course, I didn'’t mean
"ghastly," exactly.

1:45:48.100 --> 1:45:50.102
She'’s a natural.

1:45:50.136 --> 1:45:52.725
Well, Lady Grantham thinks
I can go to Hollywood

1:45:52.760 --> 1:45:54.106
and just be an American.

1:45:54.140 --> 1:45:56.004
Well, why shouldn'’t you?

1:45:56.039 --> 1:45:57.523
Come along, Bertie.

1:45:59.456 --> 1:46:02.494
Would you excuse me?
I, um-- I just want
to go downstairs.

1:46:03.046 --> 1:46:04.427
Thank you.

1:46:05.842 --> 1:46:07.706
Why is she so nice
all of a sudden?

1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:09.811
Oh, it'’s simple.
She'’s not afraid anymore.

1:46:09.846 --> 1:46:11.813
Mm-hmm.

1:46:11.848 --> 1:46:15.058
You do know that
I'’m completely mad about you?

1:46:15.092 --> 1:46:16.922
Dear Mr. Barber,

1:46:17.819 --> 1:46:20.443
I can'’t give you
what you want.

1:46:20.477 --> 1:46:23.549
But I can say
that I'’ve loved
working with you.

1:46:24.964 --> 1:46:27.001
And I must be content
with that.

1:46:27.035 --> 1:46:28.451
It'’s all
you'’re going to get.

1:46:29.935 --> 1:46:31.971
I'’m mainly glad to be
my father'’s son

1:46:32.006 --> 1:46:33.594
because I loved him.

1:46:33.628 --> 1:46:36.700
It matters more to me
than all the dynastic stuff.

1:46:36.735 --> 1:46:38.737
And so it should.

1:46:38.771 --> 1:46:41.602
I'’m happy for Sybbie, as long
as she learns how to pay back.

1:46:41.636 --> 1:46:43.880
You don'’t believe
in the idle rich?

1:46:43.914 --> 1:46:46.054
I believe in them.
I just don'’t want any member
of my family to be one of them.

1:46:46.089 --> 1:46:47.711
That sounds good to me.

1:46:47.746 --> 1:46:49.230
I think I'’ll have
another cup.

1:46:49.264 --> 1:46:50.714
Excuse me.

1:46:55.167 --> 1:46:58.170
Does that include any
future member of your family?

1:46:58.204 --> 1:47:00.414
Well, yes, of course,
becau...

1:47:04.141 --> 1:47:06.592
It'’s early days,
so don'’t say anything yet.

1:47:06.627 --> 1:47:08.801
Oh, my darling,
I won'’t say a word.

1:47:08.836 --> 1:47:11.459
But I think
that I can kiss you.

1:47:12.771 --> 1:47:15.083
Dr. Clarkson
has arrived, milord.

1:47:15.118 --> 1:47:17.603
Thank you.

1:47:17.638 --> 1:47:20.157
I notice you'’re very friendly
with the handsome Mr. Barber.

1:47:20.192 --> 1:47:21.952
Don'’t start.

1:47:21.987 --> 1:47:24.714
I'’ve kept myself out of trouble
and I'’ve been good.

1:47:25.611 --> 1:47:27.786
With some difficulty,
I might add.

1:47:28.890 --> 1:47:30.720
It is not
what you were dreading.

1:47:30.754 --> 1:47:34.068
Pernicious anemia is
often mistaken for cancer.

1:47:34.102 --> 1:47:35.932
And until a few years ago,

1:47:35.966 --> 1:47:38.003
it might well have
finished you off.

1:47:38.037 --> 1:47:39.798
But there is now treatment.

1:47:39.832 --> 1:47:41.109
Oh. Oh, thank God.

1:47:41.144 --> 1:47:42.835
It won'’t be
particularly enjoyable,

1:47:42.870 --> 1:47:45.182
but you will get better
and you won'’t die.

1:47:45.217 --> 1:47:48.082
Well, thank you,
Dr. Clarkson.

1:47:49.290 --> 1:47:51.223
Thank you very,
very, very much.

1:47:51.257 --> 1:47:52.742
Yes, thank you.

1:47:52.776 --> 1:47:55.123
Now, you must come in
and have some supper.

1:47:55.158 --> 1:47:57.643
But it'’s very much
catch-as-catch-can tonight.

1:47:57.678 --> 1:47:59.611
All the servants
are film stars now.

1:47:59.645 --> 1:48:01.613
I doubt we'’ll ever
get them back behind
the green baize door.

1:48:01.647 --> 1:48:02.959
Oh, milord!

1:48:02.993 --> 1:48:07.239
Milady! Come quickly!
Please, quickly!

1:48:07.273 --> 1:48:08.551
Doctor.

1:48:10.587 --> 1:48:13.279
Say it again.
Talk in that voice.

1:48:13.314 --> 1:48:16.731
I just wanna say
how grateful I am.

1:48:16.766 --> 1:48:19.907
You both licked me into shape
when I needed it.

1:48:19.941 --> 1:48:22.668
Thank you.So you'’ll go
to Hollywood now?

1:48:22.703 --> 1:48:24.843
Why not? I'’ve no family
to hold me here.

1:48:24.877 --> 1:48:26.638
And I'’ve done a talkie now,

1:48:26.672 --> 1:48:28.950
which puts me ahead
of the race, I hope.

1:48:28.985 --> 1:48:31.815
Just don'’t forget who you are
or where you'’ve come from.

1:48:31.850 --> 1:48:33.990
But don'’t let it
hold you back either.

1:48:34.024 --> 1:48:35.232
And good luck.

1:48:37.234 --> 1:48:38.857
Come here.

1:48:43.827 --> 1:48:46.036
Old Lady Grantham'’s
sinking fast.

1:48:46.071 --> 1:48:47.659
They'’re upstairs
with her now.

1:48:47.693 --> 1:48:51.317
Get some coffee or something
stronger just in case.

1:48:56.288 --> 1:48:59.015
Charlie,
are you all right?

1:48:59.049 --> 1:49:00.706
What did King Lear say?

1:49:01.776 --> 1:49:05.159
"Blow, winds,
and crack your cheeks.

1:49:05.193 --> 1:49:09.991
Rage, blow, you cataracts
and hurricanoes."

1:49:12.856 --> 1:49:16.066
Has the moment
of her leaving come at last?

1:49:16.895 --> 1:49:18.931
Oh.

1:49:20.036 --> 1:49:24.592
That so great a lady should go

1:49:24.627 --> 1:49:28.182
when the house
is full of film people.

1:49:39.676 --> 1:49:40.539
Maud.

1:49:41.885 --> 1:49:45.130
What are you doing here?

1:49:45.164 --> 1:49:49.099
Well, you won'’t believe me,
but I sh... I shall miss you.

1:49:49.134 --> 1:49:52.033
Or have you just come to check
I'’m on the way out?

1:49:53.276 --> 1:49:55.036
Is there anything you want?

1:49:56.417 --> 1:50:01.215
Whatever I have wanted,
dearest boy,

1:50:01.249 --> 1:50:03.838
you have given me
long before now

1:50:03.873 --> 1:50:06.669
and many times over.

1:50:06.703 --> 1:50:10.983
Dear Mama, I hope I haven'’t
been a disappointment.

1:50:12.088 --> 1:50:13.986
You were always
so much cleverer than me.

1:50:14.021 --> 1:50:14.849
True.

1:50:16.264 --> 1:50:18.750
But don'’t let that
come between us now.

1:50:18.784 --> 1:50:24.065
You are far kinder
than I have ever been.

1:50:26.136 --> 1:50:29.623
Cora, I owe you an apology.

1:50:30.382 --> 1:50:32.695
I didn'’t think
you'’d last the course.

1:50:32.729 --> 1:50:34.213
I know.

1:50:34.248 --> 1:50:36.871
But I was wrong.

1:50:36.906 --> 1:50:42.118
Now, that'’s something you
haven'’t heard me say until now.

1:50:42.152 --> 1:50:43.360
It was worth
waiting for.

1:50:44.810 --> 1:50:48.055
Oh, Mary, dear, and Edith.

1:50:49.228 --> 1:50:51.886
You'’ve been
wonderful granddaughters.

1:50:51.921 --> 1:50:53.992
And I leave you both

1:50:54.026 --> 1:50:59.238
confident that your lives
will be happy and fruitful.

1:50:59.273 --> 1:51:00.826
Oh, Granny.

1:51:00.861 --> 1:51:02.932
Darling Granny.

1:51:02.966 --> 1:51:05.348
Now, that must be enough

1:51:05.382 --> 1:51:07.971
or I shall be like
one of those guests who...

1:51:08.006 --> 1:51:11.078
...pack the car
and never leave.

1:51:11.112 --> 1:51:13.908
Mila-- Milady...

1:51:13.943 --> 1:51:16.980
Stop that noise.

1:51:17.015 --> 1:51:19.914
I can'’t hear myself die.

1:53:01.498 --> 1:53:03.466
Take that as well.

1:54:26.583 --> 1:54:28.309
Thank you, Bates.

1:54:31.588 --> 1:54:33.625
A strange day
for you and me.

1:54:34.488 --> 1:54:36.455
We'’re orphans at last.

1:54:39.631 --> 1:54:41.253
Good morning.Good morning.

1:54:47.052 --> 1:54:48.088
Milady.

1:54:53.127 --> 1:54:55.612
She'’d be so pleased
you'’re here.

1:54:55.647 --> 1:54:59.064
I can remember the first time
I really saw her, milady.

1:54:59.099 --> 1:55:01.618
Oh, close up, I mean.

1:55:01.653 --> 1:55:03.689
I'’d just been promoted
from hallboy,

1:55:03.724 --> 1:55:06.485
and I was in the dining room
with the old butler then,

1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:08.177
Mr. Mountjoy.

1:55:08.211 --> 1:55:10.282
I'’d been terrified of him.

1:55:10.317 --> 1:55:12.975
But then she walked
towards us.

1:55:13.009 --> 1:55:16.012
She was angry
about something, and...

1:55:16.047 --> 1:55:17.945
and I could see him tremble.

1:55:18.566 --> 1:55:20.637
I never forgot that.

1:55:20.672 --> 1:55:23.537
And I was never afraid
of him again.

1:55:23.571 --> 1:55:25.470
You belong to our history.

1:55:25.504 --> 1:55:28.369
In fact, I wonder
if your part is quite done.

1:55:29.577 --> 1:55:32.063
Would you ever consider
coming back?

1:55:32.097 --> 1:55:34.341
For a bit longer anyway.

1:55:34.375 --> 1:55:36.239
Milady?

1:55:36.274 --> 1:55:40.416
Barrow is leaving,
and I can'’t break in
a new butler alone.

1:55:40.450 --> 1:55:42.176
Could Andrew
be your steady hand

1:55:42.211 --> 1:55:44.213
while you train him up
to succeed you?

1:55:44.247 --> 1:55:45.973
Could he manage that,
do you think?

1:55:46.008 --> 1:55:47.595
Well, certainly.

1:55:47.630 --> 1:55:49.321
In time.

1:55:51.530 --> 1:55:54.119
Her Ladyship'’s brooch.

1:55:54.154 --> 1:55:57.053
So now the Downton torch
has passed to you.

1:55:57.088 --> 1:55:58.227
Mm.

1:55:58.261 --> 1:56:00.436
Oh, to His Lordship.

1:56:00.470 --> 1:56:03.715
But if I'’m to carry it, too,
I shall try to do so with pride.

1:56:07.339 --> 1:56:09.410
I can'’t pretend
I'’m not a little frightened.

1:56:09.445 --> 1:56:12.172
Oh, you have no need to be.

1:56:12.206 --> 1:56:14.070
You have the strength
for it.

1:56:14.105 --> 1:56:15.347
Do I?Mm.

1:56:15.382 --> 1:56:17.729
Sometimes I wonder.

1:56:17.763 --> 1:56:20.042
Well, I don'’t wonder.

1:56:20.076 --> 1:56:22.285
Not for a moment.

1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.151
And you can always count on me,
if that means anything.

1:56:26.186 --> 1:56:27.428
It means a great deal.

1:56:30.776 --> 1:56:32.571
And I think you know.

1:56:35.229 --> 1:56:37.473
Now I just need a moment
before we go.

1:56:39.061 --> 1:56:40.096
Milady.

1:56:58.735 --> 1:57:00.565
What did she have to say?

1:57:01.566 --> 1:57:03.637
She wants me back
in the house.

1:57:03.671 --> 1:57:04.810
As butler.

1:57:05.466 --> 1:57:07.020
Does she indeed?

1:57:10.161 --> 1:57:11.472
We ought to move off.

1:57:11.507 --> 1:57:13.647
Thanks for organizing this.

1:57:13.681 --> 1:57:16.339
She left instructions
down to the tiniest detail.

1:57:16.374 --> 1:57:18.583
I can imagine.

1:57:18.617 --> 1:57:21.724
You'’ll be burying me one day,
and I'’m glad to see
it'’ll be done well.

1:57:21.758 --> 1:57:24.589
I suppose the point is,
individual Crawleys
come and go,

1:57:24.623 --> 1:57:26.832
but the family lives on.

1:57:26.867 --> 1:57:29.249
Mama knew that
and believed in it.

1:57:29.283 --> 1:57:30.664
Didn'’t she just.

1:58:33.485 --> 1:58:36.212
This way now.
We shall go inside.

1:59:44.936 --> 1:59:48.560
Oh. Aha.
Here they are. Oh. Oh.

1:59:50.666 --> 1:59:51.874
Andy.

1:59:51.908 --> 1:59:53.600
Adorable.

1:59:53.634 --> 1:59:54.739
Aw.

1:59:54.773 --> 1:59:55.878
Congratulations.Thank you.

1:59:55.912 --> 1:59:57.224
Well done.

2:00:00.331 --> 2:00:03.437
-Are you exhausted?
-Sybbie, how are you doing?

2:00:08.062 --> 2:00:09.926
Congratulations.Thank you.

2:00:13.033 --> 2:00:15.311
Oh. What a bonny baby.

2:00:15.346 --> 2:00:17.417
He'’s very handsome.

2:00:17.451 --> 2:00:19.039
Look, Mary.

2:00:19.073 --> 2:00:21.248
Hello.

2:00:21.283 --> 2:00:22.939
Who'’s this?
