WEBVTT

00:15.849 --> 00:18.560
- We all have a blind spot
for our parents.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.354
We want to believe they're perfect,

00:20.354 --> 00:21.939
but the truth is--
SOPHIE'S SON : Oh wow,

00:21.939 --> 00:24.191
are you finally
admitting you have flaws?

00:24.191 --> 00:27.402
- No, I'm talking about
other people's parents.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.405
I am perfect. Now, stop interrupting.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.743
- Great! Okay, I'll see you tonight.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.081
- Ooh! Was that Drew?

00:39.081 --> 00:40.749
- Yes.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.751
He invited me to game night
with his friends.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.462
- Mm! Look at you.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.922
- Okay, can you just do normal vowels?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.758
- This is a big step in the relationship.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.803
Meeting his friends,
pretending to like game nights.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.763
- No, this is not a big step.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.849
Ha!
- Knock, knock!

00:56.849 --> 00:59.309
- Mom! Hey!

00:59.935 --> 01:02.604
What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

01:02.604 --> 01:05.274
Honey, I wouldn't miss your birthday.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.859
- Ah.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.569
My birthday was a week ago.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.904
- Well, it was supposed to be today.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.698
It's not my fault you came early.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.491
Actually, it's a little my fault.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.285
They say sex in the third trimester

01:16.285 --> 01:18.245
can really move things along.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.288
- On the plus side,

01:19.288 --> 01:21.999
I got to see Woody Harrelson's
penis from the inside.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.960
- He came early, too.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.545
- Oh, Mom!

01:26.545 --> 01:29.131
- This is the worst episode
of Gilmore Girls ever.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.342
- Come on! We're going to brunch.
You can meet my friends.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.095
But, you cannot hit on Val's
hot British boyfriend.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.680
- I would never.

01:37.181 --> 01:39.850
- You remind me of a young Sting.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.811
And you smell like him, too.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.021
- Mom.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.565
- Uh, how do you know
what Sting smells like?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.483
- Oh, honey, I know
what all the greats smell like.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.153
I made the most of my modeling days,

01:51.153 --> 01:52.446
back when I modeled.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.281
I used to be a model.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.033
- Wait, were you a model?

01:57.701 --> 01:59.703
- So, this is a new Bloody recipe.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.163
Just let me know what you, uh...

02:03.749 --> 02:05.792
- Hello.
- Oh, Sid.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.710
This is my mom.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.297
- Uh... I... just realized

02:10.297 --> 02:12.341
I only put one olive in these.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.301
What is this? The Oliveless Garden?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.722
- That was weird, right?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.933
Someone should go ask him if he's okay.
- Totally.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.352
VALENTINA/JESSE/CHARLIE:
Not it!

02:23.352 --> 02:25.395
- Uh, Mom, tonight I have game night,
but tomorrow,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.272
do you wanna do that thing
where we go to Times Square

02:27.272 --> 02:29.149
and we tell tourists wrong directions?

02:29.733 --> 02:32.069
- But I'm only here till tomorrow,

02:32.069 --> 02:34.112
and I want you to meet
my new boyfriend, Ash.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.406
- Oh. Hm.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.908
There's a new boyfriend?

02:37.908 --> 02:40.160
- Yeah, he and his band
have a show tonight in Brooklyn,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.829
and then we're off to Austria
for his European tour.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.206
So, you got to come meet him tonight.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.374
- Sophie can't go.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.417
Like she said, she's got plans.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.545
- It's fine. I'll be there.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.630
- Great! You'll love him.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.716
Oh, I got to go. I have cryotherapy.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.468
Hey, you should all try it.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.512
Keep it cold, it won't get old.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.347
I will see you tonight.
You're all invited.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.810
- There we go, all better.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.104
And look at that. Darn. Oh.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.064
I missed Sophie's mother.
Your loss.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.067
She's a delight. If you name a rock star,
she's probably smelled them.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.113
- She is the best. Which is...

03:16.113 --> 03:19.157
why it's such a bummer
she chooses the worst guys.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.494
And then they blow up her life,
and I have to pick up the pieces.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.496
I guess I'm going to be convincing her

03:24.496 --> 03:27.583
to dump this musician before
she winds up stranded in Vienna,

03:27.583 --> 03:29.877
sobbing in her schnitzel.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.545
Anybody want to keep me company?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.965
- Of course. Babe?
- Hm?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.009
Well, I had set aside tonight

03:37.009 --> 03:39.303
to try and figure out what to do
with the rest of my life.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.888
It's gonna get pathetic,
spending my days

03:40.888 --> 03:43.098
swapping recipes with
the old yentas in our building.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.100
ELLEN:
Well, I'm in.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.770
Right after I watch The Good Fight
starring my queen, Christine Baranski.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.064
- I wouldn't miss it.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.942
- Oh. Great. Show's at the Happy Idiot.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.277
- I'm missing it.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.030
I-I-I-- The Happy Idiot
is where I proposed to Meredith.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.282
I can't ever go back.
I'd be way too traumatized.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.701
- Yep. I can't go either,
out of solidarity with Jesse.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.203
- No, that's fine--
- No, no!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.456
Solidarity.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.627
- Okay, someone really needs
to go talk to him now.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.545
- Not it!
- Not it! Oh...

04:15.797 --> 04:18.342
- Jesse, I have wonderful news for you.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.261
I have finally figured out my calling.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.765
I have decided to help
those suffering from trauma.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.725
And you are going to be my first patient!

04:26.725 --> 04:28.268
- Okay, slow down.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
How did you figure out
this was your calling?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.855
- A wonderful question, patient.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.649
You see, my rarefied upbringing

04:33.649 --> 04:36.610
has left me with virtually
no practical life skills,

04:36.610 --> 04:39.404
but no one has had more therapy than I.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.822
- Oh, I didn't know you were in therapy.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.866
- Was I ever!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.869
See, when I was a boy,

04:45.869 --> 04:47.996
my mother caught me
talking to one of her wigs.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.957
She put me in therapy shortly after,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.375
and Dr. Wallace helped me realize the wigs

04:51.375 --> 04:53.502
were just a substitute
for my mother's affection.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.754
And I haven't had a conversation
with a wig in months.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.172
- Wait, months?
- And now,

04:57.172 --> 04:58.674
I'm going to pour
everything I've learned

04:58.674 --> 05:01.426
into healing others. Jesse,

05:01.426 --> 05:02.928
you are a traumatized mess.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.473
You can't go to the Happy Idiot.
You call yourself a musician,

05:06.473 --> 05:08.934
but you haven't played
that keyboard since I met you.

05:08.934 --> 05:09.977
I mean, look at it!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.020
Begging to be touched.

05:12.896 --> 05:16.149
Like one of my mother's long,
silky Saturday night wigs.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.402
- Okay. Hey, listen. Uh...

05:18.402 --> 05:20.821
Why the hell not?
Alright, take your best shot.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.864
- Great!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.907
We will start with exposure therapy.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.827
Jesse, when was the last time
you watched this viral video of yours?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.288
- Oh, I've never seen it.
I'd be way too traumatized.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.789
- Well, that's where we'll start.
- All cued up.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.542
- Wait, you have it bookmarked?
- Yeah, of course.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.169
You're my best friend.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.173
- Alexa, play The Good Fight.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.968
ALEXA:
Here's The Good Fight.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.094
- Thanks, boo.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.223
Got my Baranski, got my BLT.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.602
Everything's coming up Ellen.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.938
Aw!

05:56.064 --> 05:58.025
This rotten tomato is 0% fresh!

06:27.679 --> 06:29.348
- Save some for the rest of us.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.516
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.102
- No, I'm kidding. Go nuts.
My grandma would be happy.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.771
She hated wasted food.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.023
She also hated smartphones,
slow waiters,

06:38.023 --> 06:39.399
and Zooey Deschanel's whole vibe.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.110
I'm Rachel. I make jokes when I'm sad.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.322
- I'm Ellen. I whistle Head, Shoulders,
Knees, and Toes when I'm anxious.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.075
- These are from my favorite brunch spot.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.453
They get all of their produce
from this biodynamic farm upstate.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.749
Sorry, I'm kind of a produce nerd.
You don't care about this.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.251
- Yes, I do.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.877
I own a lettuce farm.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.170
- No way.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.467
So, how did you know my grandmother?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.802
ELLEN:
Great question.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.596
We were...

07:13.684 --> 07:15.018
best friends.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.397
I'm sorry again.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.440
It's just the only night
my mom's in town.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.567
- I totally get it.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.527
I mean, I'm gonna have to be
my own charades partner though,

07:23.527 --> 07:25.028
which is slightly awkward.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.030
I'm going to be all like, one word. Movie.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.743
I know! I know!

07:31.743 --> 07:33.245
Jumanji! Woo!

07:34.621 --> 07:37.124
That's my friends.
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.710
- Yeah, of course.
Thanks again for understanding.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.841
Okay, prepare yourself, alright?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.759
Knowing my mom's track record,

07:47.759 --> 07:50.053
Ash is probably some
Jeff Bridges-looking dude,

07:50.053 --> 07:53.140
guzzling Jim Beam and doing lines
off a filthy coffee table.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.143
- Stop making me miss college!

07:58.854 --> 08:01.398
Mom!
- Hey, girls!

08:01.398 --> 08:03.025
You made it.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.361
- And you must be Ash.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.823
- Oh . No, no, no.
I'm Ash's tour manager Brad.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.658
- Oh
- Oh, uh, this is Ash.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.161
- Hey.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.791
Sophie. I've heard so much about you.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.878
- Are you legally allowed
to be in this bar?

08:24.379 --> 08:27.382
- I can assure you,
I am a very mature 27.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.551
I've already had a colonoscopy.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.262
- Ash! Our sex life is our business.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.723
- Oh yeah?
God, is she always this funny?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.559
- Well, he's not Jeff Bridges.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.686
Probably doesn't
know who Jeff Bridges is,

08:39.686 --> 08:41.271
and to be honest, I don't either.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.900
Your mom is fine, Soph.
You can still make it to Drew's.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.986
- No, they always seem okay at first.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.738
Okay, trust me, this guy is bad news.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.617
You know what?
I know what's going on here.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.037
I bet he's a gold digger
who thinks my mom has money.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.414
Wait till he finds out

08:59.414 --> 09:01.458
she got nada en el banco.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.211
- We've talked about you
doing the Spanglish thing.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.254
- Sorry.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.173
Okay, you go get a drink with my mom.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.634
I'm gonna grill my teenage stepdad.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.971
- Teenage Stepdad would be
a great Nickelodeon show.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.723
- You're right. Let's add it
to the Google Doc.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.649
- There's some kinks to work out
with my grandma trust,

09:25.649 --> 09:27.359
but it looks like
I'm going to get this apartment.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.320
- Wow. Cool.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.408
I can Airdrop you photos and stuff.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.913
- These were Gamgam's favorite pair.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.624
Think I could pull them off?
- Yes.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.169
They accentuate your perfect neck.

09:47.963 --> 09:51.508
- So, tell me. How did you
become best friends

09:51.508 --> 09:53.343
with an 85-year-old woman?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.762
- Um, well...

09:56.972 --> 09:59.266
One day, I was, um,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.727
making a ruckus in my kitchen, and...

10:02.769 --> 10:04.980
she came over to complain.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.773
I said I loved her brooch,

10:06.773 --> 10:08.859
and the rest is herstory!

10:14.406 --> 10:16.283
- Hey, you want to get out of here?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.868
I kind of have this thing

10:17.868 --> 10:20.370
where post-death rituals
really bum me out.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.331
- You're so weird.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.627
- I was raised in Fresno,
along with my twin sisters,

10:26.627 --> 10:28.212
AKA my everything,

10:28.212 --> 10:29.838
and I've always loved music.

10:30.839 --> 10:34.176
I'm no Jason Mraz,
AKA my other everything,

10:34.176 --> 10:36.178
but I get to do what I love.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.222
You know, and that is the ultimate gift.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.140
- Aw, that's sweet.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.684
Hm. You know what else is sweet?

10:42.684 --> 10:43.727
Sugar.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.855
And if you're a little
sugar baby looking for a treat,

10:46.855 --> 10:48.357
you're barking up the wrong mama.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.108
- What?

10:50.108 --> 10:52.194
- Are you with my mom for her money?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.863
Because she doesn't have any!
Sophie,

10:54.863 --> 10:56.865
I know your mom is broke.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.159
She's also beautiful

10:59.159 --> 11:01.328
and alive and free.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.872
To be honest...

11:04.998 --> 11:06.750
I'm kind of falling in love with her.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.555
Jesse, I'm sorry. I-I...

11:28.897 --> 11:31.608
He's so sad he pissed himself.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.528
- No, didn't-- That's not even a thing!

11:34.528 --> 11:37.239
I just spilled my Cosmo on my pants.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.284
He drinks Cosmos!
He's my aunt in the '90s!

11:42.035 --> 11:44.329
- I have just one question.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.291
- Because they're sweet and tart,
and they make me happy!

11:47.958 --> 11:49.168
- No. My question was

11:49.168 --> 11:52.129
how did watching it make you feel?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.382
- Oh. Uh...

11:55.382 --> 11:57.426
Okay? I guess? I don't know.

11:57.426 --> 12:00.137
I-I've been building up so much
in my head, seeing it wasn't...

12:00.929 --> 12:02.347
that bad.

12:02.347 --> 12:05.184
- Brilliant. Then, we can
move on to the next step

12:05.184 --> 12:07.269
and return to the scene of the crime.

12:08.187 --> 12:10.480
- You know what?
Screw it. I'm ready. Let's go.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.525
- Yes. Gentlemen,
to the Happy Idiot.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.236
- I can't go!

12:17.988 --> 12:20.574
Sophie's mom
took my masturbation virginity.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.161
- So, Ash seems great.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.164
- Oh, yeah. Ash is the best.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.832
He'll only do it to Jason Mraz,

12:28.832 --> 12:31.668
but I put in earplugs, so it works.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.005
Oh! If you'll excuse me,
I gotta wish my man good luck

12:35.005 --> 12:36.256
before he goes on.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.220
- Hello, New York!

12:41.220 --> 12:43.055
Did somebody light a fire?
Because here comes Ash.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.724
- What are you up to, Lori?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.235
Unbelievable!

12:57.069 --> 12:59.279
Oh, now I remember who Jeff Bridges is.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.495
- It was the summer after seventh grade.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.624
I'd just come back from my favorite place
in the whole damn world.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.834
Spencer's Gifts.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.337
I'd gone there to buy
one of those sick-ass lava lamps.

13:15.337 --> 13:18.340
But then, I found something even better.

13:20.551 --> 13:24.304
That night,
I set everything up just so.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.849
- I don't want you to see this,
Slim Shady.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.569
SID:
But just when I got down to business,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.863
something horrible happened.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.990
SID'S MOM:
Sid, I'm doing laundry.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.325
- Big deal. So, she caught you
pulling your Paddington.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.411
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm not done.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.372
SID'S MOM: Siddhartha? Are you awake?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.382
- Slim Shady?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.302
Please stand up.

14:05.304 --> 14:09.016
- I finished later that night,
after I buried him.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.936
I finished after I buried him!

14:14.271 --> 14:15.898
I really thought I was over it,

14:15.898 --> 14:18.901
but seeing Lori just made it
all come flooding back.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.112
- Sid...

14:22.571 --> 14:24.072
Let me heal you, too.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.917
- Sophia, I need to tell you something.
- Me first.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.877
You were right about Ash.

14:36.877 --> 14:40.005
He's just a sweet guy who loves my mom.

14:40.005 --> 14:42.841
What if she's finally going
to be happy after all this time?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.718
- Mm...
There you are!

14:44.718 --> 14:47.429
Oh!

14:53.977 --> 14:56.271
- Hiya! Charlie, a word.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.734
You're chummy with all the old neighbors.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.195
Tell me everything you know
about Esther from down the hall.

15:03.195 --> 15:05.989
- Esther Lebowitz? Oh, she's a delight.
She's teaching me how to make borscht.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.282
- No, she's not. She's dead.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.825
- She was so full of life.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.702
- Not anymore. She's full of dead.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.205
And, I told her granddaughter
Rachel over there

15:13.205 --> 15:14.957
that I was her best friend

15:14.957 --> 15:17.125
because I think Rachel
might be the love of my life.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.585
- How can that be Esther's granddaughter?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.213
Esther didn't have any children.
Her birds were her children.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.589
Oh my god, are you in love with a bird?

15:22.589 --> 15:23.590
- Not this time!

15:25.092 --> 15:27.636
Why would Rachel pretend
to be someone's granddaughter?

15:27.636 --> 15:30.347
She was talking about moving
into Esther's apartment,

15:30.347 --> 15:32.391
and she was grabbing jewelry
by the handful,

15:32.391 --> 15:35.853
and she wanted to leave the shiva
after, like, 10 minutes!

15:35.853 --> 15:37.354
What if she was doing...

15:38.397 --> 15:40.399
BOTH:
Elder fraud!

15:44.069 --> 15:47.281
- Wow! Maybe it's kind of cute
how smitten she is.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.448
What if they get married?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.909
We should start buying penis-shaped
things for the bachelorette.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.828
- Ash and your mom aren't getting married.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.955
- What? Well, how do you know that?

15:56.206 --> 15:58.250
- Have you ever considered...

15:58.250 --> 16:01.628
that your mom might not pick bad guys,
but that she might...

16:01.628 --> 16:04.131
be the bad guy? Soph,

16:04.131 --> 16:06.925
I've met a few of
her boyfriends over the years,

16:06.925 --> 16:09.094
and they've all seemed totally fine.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.972
She's the one who blows things up,
and each time,

16:11.972 --> 16:13.932
you drop everything to take care of her.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.604
- You're... way off.
It's definitely the guys.

16:19.563 --> 16:22.232
- Like I said, total blind spot.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.568
- I saw her kissing Ash's manager.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.071
- Oh.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.075
I just need a-a minute.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.458
- I can't believe I've been
beating myself up all day

16:39.458 --> 16:41.627
about pretending to know your grandma.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.295
- Wait, you didn't know my grandma?

16:43.295 --> 16:44.254
- Cut the crap!

16:45.255 --> 16:48.467
You're not a granddaughter.
You're an elder frauder!

16:48.467 --> 16:50.761
- Ooh, quick question. Um,

16:50.761 --> 16:52.888
did you say Etsy Lebowitz

16:52.888 --> 16:54.848
or Esther Horowitz?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.808
Because, um, funny story.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.478
Um, Lebowitz didn't have kids,
but Horowitz did.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.147
- Which Witz are you?

17:02.147 --> 17:04.566
- Horowitz, you lunatic.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.861
- Hm...

17:08.362 --> 17:10.614
Sorry for the mix-up.

17:10.614 --> 17:13.617
And sorry for your loss, God.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.038
- Look, I-I know it's gonna be hard for me
to come back from this,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.414
but I'd like to try.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.583
- Goodbye forever, Ellen.

17:23.669 --> 17:27.172
I guess I'll probably have to see you
around the apartment building.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.383
Please don't acknowledge me.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.512
- I'm not giving up on us!

17:33.512 --> 17:35.764
I know where you live!

17:38.183 --> 17:39.768
I didn't mean that as a threat!

17:43.647 --> 17:45.148
- I did say sorry.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.655
- Right now, when you see Lori,

17:51.655 --> 17:54.241
you revert to an ashamed little boy

17:54.241 --> 17:56.034
who killed his best friend.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.328
And then masturbated shortly afterwards.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.080
- That's right.
- But you're a man now.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.708
So, I want you to march over
to Lori, buy her a drink,

18:02.708 --> 18:04.751
and prove to yourself

18:04.751 --> 18:07.671
that you are not that little boy anymore.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.590
That's what Slim Shady would have wanted.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.635
- For Slim Shady.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.102
Hi, Lori.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.479
- Oh.

18:24.479 --> 18:27.232
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.026
- Uh, can we get two whiskeys, please?

18:29.026 --> 18:31.195
One for me,
and one for the beautiful lady.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.487
- Oh.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.034
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:41.079 --> 18:44.082
You have yourself
a beautiful evening, Lori.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.669
- Good night, Sid.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.090
Hm. Beer.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.218
- Okay. You did it.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.220
You healed me. You healed me!

18:56.220 --> 18:58.639
- I did! Oh my god, I did.

18:59.348 --> 19:02.351
Alright. One down, one to go. Jesse?
- Mm-hmm.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.936
- And you're going to love this.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.271
I've convinced the house managers
to let you take to the stage

19:06.271 --> 19:07.898
at the end of the night
and perform a song.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.316
- Wait, what?!

19:10.901 --> 19:13.237
- Mom? Can we talk?

19:15.822 --> 19:16.823
Mom.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.159
Are you cheating on Ash with his manager?

19:19.576 --> 19:20.994
- What?

19:23.205 --> 19:24.748
Of course not.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.210
- Valentina saw you kissing him.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.297
- Okay, fine.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.051
Ash is adorable.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.845
It's just...

19:38.387 --> 19:41.682
I have chronic wanderlust.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.350
I mean,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.727
classic Sagittarius, am I right?

19:47.479 --> 19:50.023
- Mom.

19:50.649 --> 19:52.776
All those times we had
to pick up our lives

19:52.776 --> 19:54.945
and start over,

19:54.945 --> 19:56.989
was it the guys or was it you?

19:58.448 --> 19:59.992
- It was me not settling.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.413
I won't be made to feel bad
for wanting fireworks.

20:04.413 --> 20:05.873
- Fireworks.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.878
We had to move 13 times.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.131
I never had any real friends.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.841
I didn't have a place to call home.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.010
I don't have any childhood photos

20:18.010 --> 20:20.679
because every time we moved,

20:20.679 --> 20:22.014
we packed lighter and lighter.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.767
But somehow,

20:25.767 --> 20:28.020
that bikini poster
always made the cut.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.439
- That poster is special to me.

20:30.439 --> 20:31.732
- I know.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.901
"Mommy had the best
side boob in the business"

20:33.901 --> 20:35.319
was my first full sentence.

20:35.319 --> 20:38.197
- Oh no, that's not what I mean.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.741
You're in the poster.

20:40.741 --> 20:44.036
It was taken the day I found out
I was pregnant with you.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.455
That's why it's special to me.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.126
I haven't done a lot of things
right with my life, Sophie.

20:52.878 --> 20:55.047
But I look at that photo,

20:55.047 --> 20:58.050
and I see the best thing I ever did.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.802
I see you.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.933
Do you think maybe
we could go someplace quiet?

21:05.933 --> 21:08.519
Have a glass of wine
and talk about this Ash stuff?

21:11.271 --> 21:13.398
- No. We can't.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.442
- Oh.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.278
- I love you, Mom.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.573
But, I have plans of my own tonight.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.414
Hey.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.960
You were right about my mom.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.546
- I know. I'm sorry.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.846
- You think I can still make it to Drew's?

21:43.846 --> 21:45.722
- Oh, definitely.
Game nights last forever.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.141
It's one of the many reasons
they're so terrible.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.852
Now, go get your man.

21:59.945 --> 22:02.406
- Uh, hey, everyone. Um,

22:02.406 --> 22:03.657
some of you might recognize me

22:03.657 --> 22:05.534
from a certain viral video

22:05.534 --> 22:07.411
but now that I'm back here
at the scene of the crime,

22:07.411 --> 22:10.122
I just want to say
I'm ready to move on, New York.

22:10.122 --> 22:13.041
Uh, I'm not going to let
that one night define me. Okay.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.044
What is this? I didn't order this.
- A Cosmopolitan.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.672
- Hey, Carrie Bradshaw. That's from me.

22:20.299 --> 22:23.468
- Okay, just so we're clear.
A Cosmo is a classic cocktail, alright?

22:23.468 --> 22:25.095
- Your mom's a classic cocktail.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.430
- Don't you talk about my mom!

22:29.349 --> 22:32.644
You know what, I'm gonna quit before
this goes viral, too. Thanks, everyone!

22:35.522 --> 22:38.317
That was... not great,
but it's a good first step.

22:38.317 --> 22:41.111
So, thank you, Charlie.
- I should be the one thanking you.

22:41.111 --> 22:43.739
You guys have helped me
to confirm my dream career.

22:43.739 --> 22:46.283
To be a psychiatrist.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.286
Eight years of school?

22:50.787 --> 22:53.999
Alright, uh, to be a psychologist.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.211
Seriously?!

22:57.211 --> 22:59.838
Well, there must be something I can do
where I can listen to people's problems,

22:59.838 --> 23:01.840
offer up sage advice, and get paid for it

23:01.840 --> 23:04.134
without having to go to any school.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.720
- I'm probably gonna
regret this but, um...

23:06.720 --> 23:08.013
- I'll take it!

23:11.850 --> 23:14.728
SOPHIE'S SON: I don't get it, Mom.
Why'd you tell me this story?

23:14.728 --> 23:16.396
It was mostly about you and Grandma.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.482
- True,

23:18.482 --> 23:21.068
but I couldn't eventually
wind up with your dad,

23:21.068 --> 23:23.779
until I faced my stuff with my mom.

23:23.779 --> 23:26.156
Faced who she was, how she hurt me.

23:27.074 --> 23:29.785
And that night,
when I walked out of that bar,

23:30.494 --> 23:31.537
I started to.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.956
- Hey! I hope I didn't
miss the whole thing.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.249
Oh. You're going. Okay.

23:35.249 --> 23:37.251
Uh, four words. First word.

23:37.251 --> 23:38.585
Happy?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.880
Two? See...

23:43.590 --> 23:44.883
I'm happy to see you, too.
