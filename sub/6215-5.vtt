between 12:30 and 1 o'clock.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.160
Everyone remembers where they
were. I was in the hospital,

00:12.280 --> 00:15.000

appendices.

who we can trust.

-The man behind the bomb.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.200
The guys I smuggled in
were going to meet a scientist.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.160
Because of you,

00:24.280 --> 00:26.600
we've discovered that the wrong
people might be in prison
for the attack on London.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.800
That was the cover-up, Rachel.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.080
We need to speak to this guy.
Dr Abid Malik.

one of the richest men
in the world.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.520
Owner of South Korea's
nuclear power industry.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.720
He's worth 110 billion easy
and he's only 23.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.000
VIK: What's his secret?

01:36.120 --> 01:39.480
JEZ: For one, he's channelling
12 billion into a British
bank account.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.440
-No wonder MI5 want us to find
out what he's planning to buy.
-Or who.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.240
-Is anyone asking where I am?
-RACHEL: Not so far.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.160
It's the Kwang Ho surveillance
job, they've got their
hands full.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.960
I can't believe I'm doing this.
You know my chances of getting
in here are like 160-1.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.160
If someone set up Abid Malik
over the London bomb,

02:38.280 --> 02:40.800
they also killed Hannah
because she found out.

02:40.920 --> 02:44.760
The ringleaders are still out
there and Malik is the only one
left who knows who they are.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.880
It's a miracle he's still alive.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.880
Have you got the timings right?

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Malik has his examination at
10:00, I'll activate the virus
as soon as his doctor arrives.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.320
That will be my cue. If you
haven't heard from me by 10.45,

02:56.440 --> 02:58.080

gone wrong.

we've been bugging the bank.

You're through to Charlie Green.

Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you

RACHEL: Charlie, you need to
abort. Shit's kicking off here.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.240
Call me urgently!

15:08.960 --> 15:10.440
Give me your right hand.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.120
Someone reported interference?

15:35.440 --> 15:36.960
You took your time!

15:38.120 --> 15:40.800
Where are we at
with the tactical unit?

15:40.920 --> 15:43.080
Sweeping the building, but
there are hundreds of offices.

15:43.200 --> 15:47.320
-We need more units.
-Environmental movements don't
commit terrorist acts like this.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.000
Arson, mail bombs maybe,
but suicide bombers?

15:50.120 --> 15:54.280
We'll run background checks
on the usual groups.
Someone must know something.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.360
Let's get a SWAT team
on standby.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.800
We have to make it look like
we're going to meet his demands.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.800
-Tell Kylie to bring
Kwang Ho down.
-You heard Yates.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.040
You can't bring him to the
banking hall.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.160
-What choice do we have?
-Buy time!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.000
Get a jamming device in there,
but don't play into their hands.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.840
He's going to blow
the rest of them up.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.720
I won't sacrifice 20 lives
for the sake of one businessman,

16:14.840 --> 16:17.240
no matter what Yates
or the government says.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.120
RACHEL: Kylie, keep an eye on
Kwang Ho, we're going to send
him down to the banking hall.

RACHEL: Rob, in five seconds
the phone behind the first
counter is going to ring.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.160
Make sure you pick it up.

talking to the police.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.680
-Yes?
-RACHEL: The terrorists
have made contact.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.320
-They're willing to release
three hostages.
-OK, sure.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.560
RACHEL: Get them ready.
We don't have much time.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.080
-Who was it?
-The police.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.040
They want us to pick
three people to go free.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.040
How do we decide who goes
and who stays?

17:03.160 --> 17:04.960
Women first, I guess.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.640
I've got a better idea.
Why don't we just lock her
in the safe?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.080
It's got to be bomb proof.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.400
My personal opinion, I don't
think that thing is real.

17:13.520 --> 17:19.600
But until we know who and what
we're dealing with here, I say
we do exactly what they tell us.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.720
Which does not include
sticking her in the safe.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.680
-So who goes first?
-If that kid can
hold it together

17:25.800 --> 17:28.400
going through what
she's going through,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.800
I reckon so can we.
So I for one am staying.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.840
Who's joining me?

17:35.800 --> 17:38.560
Fuck it, no-one's going to vote
for me anyway. Count me in.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.360
Good.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.040
You?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.280
-Pick who goes.
-Me? How do I decide?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.200
I don't care.
Draw lots. Whatever.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.960
-How you doing?
-You can't come
anywhere near me.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.320
I'm gonna need to take
a closer look at that thing.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.800
There might be a way
I can get it off.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.280
I told you, if anyone tries to
come near me they'll explode it.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.640
The people that did this,

18:10.760 --> 18:13.720
who are they? You must have
seen them, heard something.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
They put a hood on me.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.840
They said if I didn't do
what they said, they'd kill me.

18:23.840 --> 18:29.080
Hey, look, if I can get
a call to your mum, a message...

18:29.200 --> 18:31.400
Just tell her to do
whatever they ask.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.560
Look. How long
is this going to take?

18:48.680 --> 18:50.320
The interference is coming
from somewhere.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.800
I need to be sure that no-one
is concealing a bug
or jamming device.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.600
He's clean.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.040
Has he come into contact
with anyone else?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.760
-Him in there. Why?
-I need to check him as well.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.800
It's possible he could have
passed something to him.

19:02.920 --> 19:06.400
It's just protocol.
I get bollocked otherwise.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.280
I guess it's OK.
I'll show you in.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.360
What is it now?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.520
Is he safe?
I mean, he's not violent, is he?

19:19.640 --> 19:21.960
Nah, he's some kind
of scientist.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.760
As long as he doesn't get his
hands on any uranium 238,
we'll be fine.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.160
-You're new here, aren't you?
-First time.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.960
Don't worry.
We've got him house trained.

-I need to check his hair.
-Go ahead.

to the left, please.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.520
IT, Sir.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.000
And who gave him authority
to touch Malik?

20:22.120 --> 20:25.160
He said he needed
to scan the prisoner.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.640
I'm going to need to power down
some of your machines
to reboot the system.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.200
My guess is one of your
internal fans in the hard drive

20:36.320 --> 20:39.640
caused a motherboard to
overheat. We get it from time
to time.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.000
Should only take
a few minutes to reset.

it's cooling down? I'm diabetic.

-I have to take my shot.
-Deacon. Show him to the bogs.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.360
Just there.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.560
I guess by now you've realised
I'm not the guy from IT.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.280
This is not a trick. I am
risking my life by being here.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.680

some questions.

turn your head to the left
for yes

21:54.040 --> 21:56.000

22:12.800 --> 22:15.240
The CCTV control room
is in the basement here.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.920
If Kylie can get onto the roof,
there's a service lift
that'll take her there.

22:19.040 --> 22:22.320
-There shouldn't be any cameras.
-Even if she gets there unseen,

22:22.440 --> 22:25.000
once we pull the CCTV,
he said he'll detonate the bomb.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.440
Got any better ideas?

22:26.560 --> 22:29.400
Possibly. The brand name
Rob gave us for the vest.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.280
Looks like an own brand
for an army surplus outfitter.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.800
I can trace credit card
transactions, CCTV...

22:34.920 --> 22:36.880
Of course!
It wasn't just a lucky shot.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.320
The sniper must be a trained
marksman. Could be ex-military.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.080
It would explain the knowledge
of explosives.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.840

of the hostages go

22:56.960 --> 22:58.960

I'm watching you.

and be careful, we still
haven't located the sniper.

gonna go first,
no need to worry.

you want to take your place.

when to go. Are you ready?

30:39.680 --> 30:42.240
The guy's well trained.
He's completely
gone to ground.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.960
-He can't be far.
-I've found Puraflex.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.760
The only thing they sell like
the vest is this flak jacket.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.160
-Not the same as the
girl's wearing.
-No, but check this Army belt.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.120
In use by the British Army
in Iraq and Afghanistan up
to a couple of years ago.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.160
Stitch it to the jacket.
They're the same.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.280
He customised the flak jacket
with his own Army equipment.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.880
This is the shop's camera.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.520
This is the only person to have
bought the vest
in the past month.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.240
Who is he?

31:09.400 --> 31:11.640
VIK: I'll run it through
the image analyser.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.840
JEZ: I'm sending it
over to you, Vik.

31:23.080 --> 31:27.800
Lance Corporal Leo Whitelaw.
Royal Signals for four years.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.080
Three tours of duty
in the Middle East.
Discharged a year ago.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.520
This guy knows everything
there is to know about radio
signals, satellite links...

31:34.640 --> 31:39.040
And bomb detonators. OK.
Any criminal records,
any affiliations?

31:39.160 --> 31:43.840
No record but it says here he
was a member of an environmental
watchdog group called RADIUS.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.960
-Never heard of them.
-They monitor radiation leaks

31:46.080 --> 31:49.400
-from Britain's
nuclear reactors. Shit.
-What?

31:49.520 --> 31:53.240
Whitelaw got seconded
to the decontamination clean-up
after the London nuclear bomb.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.400
Maybe he got contaminated,
explains his grudge
against the nuclear industry.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.320
There's got to be more.
He said ask our bosses what
the money's really paying for.

32:01.440 --> 32:05.440
I've tracked down an old
informer, journalist who used to
have affiliations with RADIUS.

32:05.560 --> 32:08.400
RACHEL: OK, go.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.680
Last time I heard from Leo
Whitelaw he was working with a
woman called Hester Simon.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.080
How do we find her?

32:14.200 --> 32:17.200
Wrexham cemetery.
She was killed.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.880
Supposedly a drug overdose but
rumour has it was one
of your lot.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.360
Since when does MI5 assassinate
environmental activists?

32:24.480 --> 32:26.480
Somebody high up
wanted her out the picture.

32:26.600 --> 32:30.320
You're not making any sense.
What possible threat could she
have been?

32:30.440 --> 32:33.080
Just before she died,
Hester Simon came to me.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.720
RADIUS were monitoring radiation
leaks from some of the new range
of power stations.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.280
Seems they found out
something else.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.840
That's all I know.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.000
Whatever they discovered has
already got one person killed.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.280
-I don't want any part of it.
-Spit it out, come on.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.960
For the last ten years
you people have been using
the threat of terrorism

32:53.080 --> 32:57.240
to systematically shut down any
form of peaceful protest
in this country.

32:57.360 --> 33:01.120
You radicalised the Muslims.
Now you're radicalising
the environmentalists.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.000
You're the ones who turned
Leo Whitelaw into a terrorist.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.480
JEZ: I'm bored of this.
Just tell me where Whitelaw is.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.960
I don't know.

33:09.080 --> 33:13.760
-Alice, can I...?
Just let me sit...
-Get away from me!

33:13.880 --> 33:18.040
Why don't you go and sit with
him? After all, you're in this
together, aren't you?

33:20.320 --> 33:22.520
ALICE: Don't we have you
to thank for all this?

33:22.640 --> 33:25.640
You happy, now you're
getting us all killed?

33:25.760 --> 33:28.120
You people should be
thanking me.

33:28.240 --> 33:32.120
If it weren't for people like
me, your country would
be crippled.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.760
How would you pay for all your
schools and hospitals then?

33:35.880 --> 33:37.960
It's my money that's
paying for your education.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.840
Actually, that's hers.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.400
And how did she get it?

33:43.920 --> 33:46.120
Wake up, little girl.

33:46.240 --> 33:50.200
The money she lavishes on you
doesn't come from nowhere.
It comes from people like me.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.400
-This isn't helping any of us.
-If we're going to die for him,
at least he owes us an apology.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.280
No-one's going to die. OK?

33:59.840 --> 34:02.880
Who gave the authority to send
Lim Kwang Ho into the
banking hall?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.160
I did. Whitelaw said he'd
blow up the bank if I didn't.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.200
You went against a direct order
from the Home Secretary?

34:07.320 --> 34:09.240
-I had no option.
-SARAH: There are
always options.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.200
You just made a peaceful
resolution to this less likely.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.560
Now we have no bargaining chip.
Where's Charlie?

34:14.680 --> 34:18.280
Chasing up a lead. Due any
second. Whitelaw said I should
ask my bosses

34:18.400 --> 34:20.040
what the 12 billion was really
paying for.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.440
You think I haven't
been trying to find that out?

34:22.560 --> 34:26.760
Whoever the powers-that-be
choose to do their business
with is not our concern.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.040
We have a bank full of hostages
depending on us for their lives.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.120
Tell Charlie
I want to see him...

34:32.240 --> 34:34.360
-Sorry I took so long.
-SARAH: Where the hell
have you been?

34:34.480 --> 34:37.760
I know how we can find Whitelaw.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.520
He'll have hard-wired the CCTV
to a wireless router.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.360
If we can find that,
we can trace the signal.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.600
Look back through the bank's
CCTV from the last
weeks, months.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.680
Someone inside there
is helping him.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.920
We need Kylie
to find that router.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.800
Kylie, once you're on
the rooftop,
access the service lift.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.920
This will take you
to the CCTV room.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.600
You have to hurry.

35:04.120 --> 35:07.360
Once she's inside the CCTV
room, we should be able
to trace

35:07.480 --> 35:09.600
the signal to wherever
Whitelaw is picking it up.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.480
We know what
the $12 billion is for.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.000
Our informant claimed
the London bomb
gave the Government

35:30.120 --> 35:33.040
the excuse to fast track a
nuclear programme
that wasn't safe

35:33.160 --> 35:34.920
and didn't have
the necessary legislation.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.400
What's this got
to do with today?

35:36.520 --> 35:39.120
Leo Whitelaw and RADIUS found
out that the British government

35:39.240 --> 35:43.080
has been secretly developing
a long-term repository
for high-level nuclear waste.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.120
They're planning to bury it
under British soil and are
cutting corners on safety

35:46.240 --> 35:47.560
to rush it through.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.560
What's that got to do
with Kwang Ho's meeting
at the bank?

35:49.680 --> 35:51.720
The twelve billion dollars
isn't for the reactors.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.640
That's payment for dumping
nuclear waste.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.800
You're saying the Government
is burying Korean nuclear waste

35:56.920 --> 36:00.880
under British soil
in exchange for cash?

36:01.000 --> 36:04.680
-Billions of it.
-They're using it to bankroll
the rebuilding programme.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.240
Whitelaw's right. They can't be
allowed to do get away with it.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.120
Whatever the rights or wrongs,
we need to stay focused.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.480
We're dealing with a fanatic.
If he is an extremist, who's to
say he isn't going to blow up

36:14.600 --> 36:17.080
the building the minute
Kwang Ho finishes his broadcast?

36:17.200 --> 36:20.160
It makes sense. It's why he
wanted Kwang Ho
in that banking hall.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.440
He wants him right
next to the bomb.

36:21.560 --> 36:25.480
Kylie needs to find
that router. Fast.

36:25.600 --> 36:29.640
CHARLIE: Kylie, we have got
11 minutes till detonation.
How are we doing?

36:29.760 --> 36:32.400
-KYLIE: Almost there.
-Good. Be careful.

36:32.520 --> 36:36.040
CHARLIE: He'll have access
to all the cameras
including the basement.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.880
When I say "go",
run to the pillar.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.720
Go!

36:42.840 --> 36:46.720
The CCTV room is straight
ahead, then first on
the right. Wait.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.920
OK, go!

37:01.120 --> 37:03.760
-OK, I'm in.
-OK. The router
has to be there somewhere.

37:03.880 --> 37:06.720
Look for any small box
with an aerial.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.800
What's happening?

37:12.920 --> 37:16.040
-Why is everything taking
so long?
-We're going to be OK.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.840
They're going
to get us out of here.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.760
How can you be so sure?

37:19.880 --> 37:22.120
I know what it feels like
to think you're going to die.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.640
I wasn't so far from London
when the bomb went off.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.640
I reckon if I can survive
that, then...

37:27.760 --> 37:29.920
then I'm indestructible.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.840
-I've been pre-disastered.
-What, so now you're
my lucky charm?

37:35.200 --> 37:37.560
You're being too hard
on your mum.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.360
-She loves you.
-She uses me as a status symbol.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.120
She parades me around her
friends like I'm an accessory,

37:43.240 --> 37:44.960
"Alice got straight As
in her GCSEs,"

37:45.080 --> 37:48.960
"Alice got a scholarship." She'd
got my whole life mapped out
for herself.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.280
Well, today was a wakeup call.

37:50.400 --> 37:54.840
Little Alice's life
just took a major wrong turn.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.960
Why is it taking so long
to get a simple TV crew here?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.760
-The girl. She's our insider.
-What?

38:10.880 --> 38:13.480
She knew about
the news broadcast.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.040
No-one's even mentioned it.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.320
-Kylie could have said
something to the mother.
-Nah, she didn't.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.760
-It's her, I know it.
-He's right.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.240
You need to see this. I've just
retrieved it from the
bank's CCTV.

38:24.360 --> 38:29.320
This is in the basement.
Only cleared personnel
can get access.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.120
-VIK: Recognise anyone?
-Alice.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.280
She must have used
her mother's security pass.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.480
Whitelaw must have recruited
her, then radicalised her.

38:36.600 --> 38:40.040
If Whitelaw is a fanatic,
there's a chance Alice Hamilton
is a suicide bomber.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.760
We're running out of time.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.840
We've got five minutes
until he wants that broadcast.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.800
Rob, we have a positive ID
of Alice entering the CCTV room.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.320
She's got to be working
with Whitelaw. We need
a location from her.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.960
You can't come anywhere near me,
they're watching us.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.000
I don't think they'll mind.

38:58.120 --> 39:02.000
What do you think these people
would do if they knew
you were behind this?

39:05.000 --> 39:07.960
I saw a situation like this
once. I was working in a
hospital in London

39:08.080 --> 39:09.440
just after the bomb.

39:09.560 --> 39:13.840
There was a guy, must have been
17, he broke into the cabinet

39:13.960 --> 39:17.480
where we kept the retroviral
vaccine and stole the last of
the supplies.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.280
He must have been desperate,
I guess.

39:19.400 --> 39:24.760
The other patients, they hunted
him down and beat him to death.

39:24.880 --> 39:28.280
It's amazing what people
will do when they're put
under extreme pressures.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.080
You tell us where Leo is and we
can all get out of here alive.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.000
Fuck you. Do you think
I'd tell you?

39:42.480 --> 39:45.120
Yes, Mummy, you bred a monster.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.760
-Do you think they'll expel me
from school?
-What have you done?

39:47.880 --> 39:50.280
I've done something
worthwhile with my life.

39:50.400 --> 39:54.720
I'm stopping the damage that
you and scum like Kwang Ho
are doing.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.080
He told you that he was
your boyfriend, didn't he?

40:07.600 --> 40:09.040
He used you.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.520
We know, Alice.

40:10.640 --> 40:14.040
He used you
to get to your mother.

40:14.160 --> 40:17.000
We've seen the CCTV of you
putting the transmitter
in the basement.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.880
-Who ARE you?
-Wake up!

40:20.480 --> 40:22.520
These people are never going
to make that broadcast

40:22.640 --> 40:26.560
and in a few minutes
your so-called boyfriend
is going to blow you to pieces.

40:26.680 --> 40:29.520
Good. Then I'll die
for something I believe in.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.480
CHARLIE: Kylie, we've only got
four minutes. Hurry.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.880
I've found it.
I found the router, Charlie.
Sending you co-ordinates now.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.120
Got it. Get this to Jez now.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.960
Jez, it's being streamed
through to your PDA.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.320
He's somewhere in the
tenement blocks,
east sector 12.

40:51.440 --> 40:53.560
We should be there
in four or five minutes.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.160
That's no good.
You've got three.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.560
Rob, we need an exact address
from the girl.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.880
That bomb's real, you know?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Course it is,
I'm not faking this.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.360
I've been around explosives.
Leo's done a good job.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.080
There's enough Semtex there
to you to wipe out all of us
and half the street.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.600
You mean nothing to him.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.160
Good try,
but I don't believe you.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.440
You're just a whore.
The same as her.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.360
-Alice!
-You're the one being used.
Don't you get it?

41:25.480 --> 41:28.080
All you're doing is protecting
the business interests
of Kwang Ho.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.880
That's all you people do.
You're not saving lives.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.480
If you were, you wouldn't be
helping the Government
let my mother

41:34.600 --> 41:38.800
and Kwang Ho poison future
generations with
nuclear radiation.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.000
Leo is a fanatic.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.920
I've met people like him.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.840
War does that to people.

41:46.960 --> 41:51.480
He won't think twice about
killing you and all the people
in here.

41:51.600 --> 41:55.920
A few innocent deaths won't
mean anything if we can
save the planet.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.920
Whatever's happenning between
Kwang Ho and the
British Government

41:59.040 --> 42:02.080
is not the fault
of these people.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.040
You tell me where Leo is
and stop this now.

42:09.480 --> 42:12.280
RACHEL: One minute to
detonation, Jez, where are you?

42:13.440 --> 42:14.600
Almost at the target.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.640
You tell me where he is
and I promise you,

42:19.760 --> 42:23.400
I promise that
you won't get harmed.

42:28.680 --> 42:33.800
We've got the target's address
from the girl. He's on the
fourth floor, Unit 1138.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.280
Tell Rob, when we cut the

Rob, stand by to get
the hostages out.

42:43.280 --> 42:44.360
Kill the CCTV.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.000
Pull every wire out
you can see.

42:46.120 --> 42:49.320
It will buy us some time
while we get the hostages out.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.240
Then get the hell out of there.

Where's the CCTV?

-It's not us.
-Now we need
to evacuate the building!

stairs and towards the door!

Sweetie, I didn't realise.
You must have hated me
and I've failed you.

I'm so sorry.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.920
I'm sorry, I love you.

You've got 10 seconds to get
the pictures back on or I blow

Come on, Jez.

10 seconds.

to leave right now!

This is it. On my count.

Something tells me he won't
be investing in a British

45:04.400 --> 45:05.560
Can I see Leo now?

45:05.680 --> 45:07.720
No. They killed him.

Hey. You did a good job.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.480
-Thanks.
-You had a visitor.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.640
A policeman. DS Phillips.

It's routine.
I'll give him a call.

-Thanks.
-He said he's investigating
a suspected murder.

Someone you knew.

What's going on?

45:36.600 --> 45:40.760
They think I might know
something, but I've told them
everything I know. It's routine.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.720
He's asking a lot
of questions about you.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.520
Are you a suspect?

Not now. Too many people
know about it.

You saw Malik. What happened
in there? You never called.

-What did he tell you?
-A lot.

He was shouting something
at the end, though.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.960
Something for me to hear.

-What was he saying?
-Two bombs!

Exactly.
