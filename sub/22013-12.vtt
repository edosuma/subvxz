00:01.305 --> 00:03.525
You're witnessing the power ofEmpire.

00:03.568 --> 00:06.180
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.877
Catch all-new episodes Wednesdays.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.270
And check out our other Fox programs--

00:09.313 --> 00:12.316
Star, The Gifted, and
Lethal Weapon.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.710
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.972
Only on Fox.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.454
Previously onEmpire...
-We're broke.

00:19.497 --> 00:23.327
-You, me, the other ex-wife...
-Let me handle this.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.460
Want to introduce you
to Kelly Patel.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.288
The king of Silicon Valley?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.507
When do we tell the Lyons
that I'm buying Empire?

00:29.551 --> 00:31.074
Leave the Lyons to me.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.208
I am pregnant.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.774
What did J Poppa say?

00:35.818 --> 00:37.211
I don't think that we should
see each other anymore.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.299
And so...

00:38.342 --> 00:40.344
I'm really sorry.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.433
The car bomb. It was me.

00:42.477 --> 00:43.608
[yells]

00:45.001 --> 00:46.350
Lucious...

00:46.394 --> 00:48.483
I can't-can't catch my breath.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.224
Juanita!

00:52.748 --> 00:53.923
-[siren wailing]
-EMT: Get the doors.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.490
Easy!

00:55.533 --> 00:57.013
What do we got?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.755
Patient is a 47-year-old
African-American woman.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.192
Sudden onset of extreme nausea,
dizziness, shortness of breath.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.499
-There they go with all that
talking; get her inside! -Don't

01:04.542 --> 01:06.283
-worry, we'll handle it. Let's
go. -What's happening to her?

01:06.327 --> 01:07.763
-Where are they taking me?
-I don't know.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.199
What's happening to her?!

01:09.243 --> 01:10.461
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Let's go!

01:10.505 --> 01:13.029
-Everybody move!
-Lucious?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.683
-NURSE: Watch your back!
-Make a hole, coming through!

01:14.726 --> 01:17.903
EMT 2:
Clear bay two, please.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.341
Daddy, please, please!
Wake up, Dad.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.560
-Candace, what happened?
-Daddy had a heart attack.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.345
CANDACE: I'm gonna go with him
to the hospital.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.608
EMT: Get the levels.
Clear the room.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.349
Page Dr. Set.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.133
EMT 2:
Let's go, move her.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.353
Saturation's 100,

01:32.396 --> 01:35.573
-BP 136/92, heart rate 100.
-DOCTOR: What were you doing

01:35.617 --> 01:37.401
when this started?
Were you under any stress?

01:37.445 --> 01:41.927
Probably arguing with Lucious,
but that ain't nothing new.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.842
Here's the EKG.

01:43.886 --> 01:45.844
ST elevations
in the anterior lateral leads.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.368
All right, she's having an MI.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.718
Let's get her
to the cath lab, stat.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.981
[gasping]

01:52.024 --> 01:54.810
Look here, man, you been singing
that same song for an hour.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.638
-I need some info...
-Please, sir, be patient.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.205
Let the doctors do their job.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.293
You don't walk away from me

01:59.336 --> 02:00.381
when I'm talking to you.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.382
I will call in a helicopter

02:01.425 --> 02:03.166
and move her to a real hospital.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.385
DOCTOR:
Mr. Lyon!

02:04.428 --> 02:05.777
Finally, some answers.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.257
Ms. Lyon had a heart attack.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.000
What?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.523
We don't know how serious

02:12.567 --> 02:15.091
or whether she's suffered
permanent damage.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.834
Now, we've taken her
to the cath lab.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.618
She gonna be
all right, though, right?

02:20.662 --> 02:23.230
The good news is that
you got her here quickly.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.580
Now, I'll update you
when I know something.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.582
But you better call your family.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.149
It's gonna be a long night.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.249
How is she?

02:43.293 --> 02:45.991
Congratulations, Andre.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.036
Excuse me?

02:47.079 --> 02:49.038
Isn't this what you wanted?

02:49.081 --> 02:51.214
What the hell are you talking...
What I-what I wanted?

02:51.258 --> 02:55.262
When we were in Vegas, and you
wanted me and your mother dead.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.482
-Oh, come on, man, I...
-Hold on, hold on, just stop.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.224
Dre, why don't you
just leave, man?

03:01.268 --> 03:02.356
I'm not going nowhere, man.

03:02.399 --> 03:03.357
She's my mother, too.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.097
Go home, Dre.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.664
Somebody will call your ass.

03:21.679 --> 03:24.900
I swear, Mama's like
a superhero.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.381
How the hell did this happen?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.992
I don't know.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.343
I just wish that there
was something that we could do.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.344
Anything.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.306
You want to pray?

03:40.916 --> 03:42.700
You pray?

03:44.006 --> 03:47.009
Every night, with Bella.

03:48.358 --> 03:51.535
Yeah, okay.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.276
Dad, you want to...

03:54.582 --> 03:57.715
Y'all keep that to y'all selves.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.329
[indistinct voice over P.A.]

04:11.773 --> 04:13.557
[exhales]

04:23.393 --> 04:27.136
You and me ain't said much
to each other.

04:30.182 --> 04:33.969
I mean, you took
my daddy from me,

04:34.012 --> 04:36.580
my mother's love,

04:36.624 --> 04:39.583
my leg, my memory.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.977
So now what?

04:42.020 --> 04:46.329
You couldn't get me, so now
you turned your wrath on her?

04:46.373 --> 04:48.331
[sniffles]

04:48.375 --> 04:50.464
I never asked you for anything.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.727
Everything I've accomplished
in this world,

04:52.770 --> 04:56.296
I've done it without you.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.476
But I'm gonna tell you
something.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.348
If you take Cookie from me,

05:05.392 --> 05:07.611
if you take her from my boys,

05:07.655 --> 05:10.745
I'm gonna rain down hell
on your world

05:10.788 --> 05:12.355
like you have never seen.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.447
Amen.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.493
â™ª

05:26.761 --> 05:29.067
Ms. Lyon. I'm Dr. Stein,

05:29.111 --> 05:31.243
the cardiologist
Mr. Lyon requested.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.767
You got lucky.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.377
I don't feel lucky.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.771
You had what's known as a STEMI.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.381
A mild heart attack.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.384
But we were able
to balloon open the artery,

05:41.428 --> 05:43.255
so you didn't need a stent.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.649
Now, you have to pass
a stress test first,

05:45.693 --> 05:47.825
-but you should be home
within a week. -In a week?

05:47.869 --> 05:51.394
This is very much related
to diet and stress.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.265
Without some major lifestyle
changes, it could happen again,

05:53.309 --> 05:56.791
and you might not
be so lucky the next time.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.229
I'll have plenty of time to
lecture you later, but for now,

06:00.272 --> 06:01.491
do you want to see your family?

06:01.535 --> 06:03.319
Yes. Thank you.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.277
Do you have a mirror?

06:05.321 --> 06:07.454
Oh, let me check for you.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.194
Yes.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.587
Here you go.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.849
HAKEEM:
There she is.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.287
-Ma.
-Oh, my babies.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.769
Oh, my babies. Yes.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.338
Pick up them long faces. Yeah?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.558
I'll be all right.
I'm-a get through this.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.342
[chuckles]

06:26.386 --> 06:28.823
We Lyons.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.657
CELESTE:
Cannot beat that view, Lupe.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.267
It's nice.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.790
Neighbors mind a little music?

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
It's more
of a classical music crowd.

06:41.618 --> 06:45.579
But they can always broaden
their horizons.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.102
Trust me, this is
the perfect spot to unwind

06:47.145 --> 06:48.495
when you wrap your tour.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.497
You know, based
on the stories I heard

06:50.540 --> 06:52.499
about the partying you two do,

06:52.542 --> 06:54.675
you should come
to the next tour stop.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.328
Ah, you must have me confused

06:56.372 --> 06:58.679
with Eddie's ratchet
third wife, Giselle.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.724
The one he left me for.

07:00.768 --> 07:03.248
Ooh. No offense. Sorry.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.512
-No offense.
-No. None taken.

07:05.555 --> 07:09.341
I'm still the one Eddie calls
when he needs to close a deal.

07:09.385 --> 07:12.562
But I see that I'm dealing
with a man who knows himself.

07:12.606 --> 07:17.175
The type of man
who should be living here.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.831
I like wifey number two.

07:20.875 --> 07:21.963
Hmm.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.923
-Celeste.
-Celeste.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.318
Know what? I'll take it.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.321
All right, Lupe.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.670
My manager will hit you later
with the details.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.629
-Good.
-Cool.

07:35.672 --> 07:36.978
Celeste.

07:37.021 --> 07:39.023
Lupe.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.724
[door closes]

07:43.767 --> 07:44.942
Selling this place
is a desperate move.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.378
You know that, right?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.642
"Desperate" is what
you've made us.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.382
You think I don't understand
what's at stake here?

07:50.426 --> 07:52.515
-Come on.
-[stammers] Look, not t-the way

07:52.559 --> 07:55.779
you and that Giselle are running
out there, racking up more debt.

07:55.823 --> 07:59.783
And the type of people
you two are borrowing from?

07:59.827 --> 08:01.829
Eddie.

08:04.832 --> 08:07.399
I'm scared.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.580
Everyone will be paid

08:13.623 --> 08:16.800
once I push this deal through
at Empire.

08:16.844 --> 08:20.412
And we'll all be back
where we belong.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.458
I promise.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.819
Uh, who told you
to do all of this?

08:35.863 --> 08:39.780
You need to be taken care of,
and I'm not taking any chances.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.607
Excuse me.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.696
Well, I hope you had

08:42.739 --> 08:44.436
good enough sense
not to call my sisters.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.829
[Lucious chuckles]

08:45.873 --> 08:48.832
-I want to save you,
not kill you. -[chuckles]

08:48.876 --> 08:51.443
At least you got
that part right.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.707
Had you asked me
before you did all of this,

08:53.750 --> 08:56.231
I would've told you all I need

08:56.274 --> 08:58.146
to feel better
is to go back to work.

08:58.189 --> 09:02.629
Yeah, I know that,
but right now, that's my domain.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.718
Now, I've flown in
the best cardiologists,

09:04.761 --> 09:07.982
nutritionists and trainer
from across the country.

09:08.025 --> 09:11.855
All you need to think about
doing is just getting healthy.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.119
[sighs]

09:23.301 --> 09:25.608
I done sent Lucious
on a wild goose chase

09:25.652 --> 09:29.264
so I could get some me time, and
here y'all are, breathing on me.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.222
Ma, the only reason
why we all up under you

09:31.266 --> 09:32.484
is because we love you.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.878
You would do the same.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.227
How you feeling, anyway?

09:36.271 --> 09:37.315
Out of the loop.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.795
What's going on at Empire?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.449
What about my 20 For 20?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.277
HAKEEM: Well, Lucious
got Empire handled.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.453
Why we caring about
the 20 For 20 right now, anyway?

09:44.496 --> 09:47.717
Because it keeps me sane.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.850
Look, if y'all want
to help me get better,

09:49.893 --> 09:52.504
you can continue
to keep our legacy alive.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.636
How about that?

09:53.680 --> 09:55.638
[sighs]

09:55.682 --> 09:57.684
All right, yeah, we could
do that, especially since

09:57.727 --> 10:00.338
-it's so important to you.
-Yes. Thank you.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.036
Oh, Hakeem?

10:02.079 --> 10:05.561
Lucious and I still want you
to do that duet with Tiana.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.476
So what are we, rewarding chicks
for dumping me, now, Ma?

10:07.519 --> 10:08.825
Boy, just do it.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.697
Your father and I
already approved the song.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.917
You need to huddle up
with publicity,

10:13.961 --> 10:16.659
you need to figure out
what kind of reputation

10:16.703 --> 10:17.791
you can salvage.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.662
-All right.
-HAKEEM: Love you, Ma.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.316
COOKIE:
And I love y'all, too.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.014
Go be productive.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.886
JAMAL:
Dre, come on, man.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.844
I really don't think
she needs the stress right now.

10:27.888 --> 10:31.500
I just... I need to see that
she's okay with my own eyes.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.763
Go on, let him in, y'all.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.694
Is this my fault?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.522
My heart?

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
[laughs]

10:55.089 --> 10:57.395
Boy, you wish
you were that important.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.701
[chuckles]

10:58.745 --> 11:00.703
I broke the family, Ma.

11:01.748 --> 11:02.879
I had a million chances

11:02.923 --> 11:05.752
to change things,

11:05.795 --> 11:08.363
but I didn't.

11:10.452 --> 11:14.282
Yeah.

11:14.325 --> 11:18.199
[chuckling]: I know Lucious
can drive people to murder,

11:18.242 --> 11:21.855
but...

11:21.898 --> 11:25.162
what you did hurt me, Andre.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.863
It hurt me to the core.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.386
[sighs]

11:34.650 --> 11:37.131
I'm sorry, Ma.

11:39.176 --> 11:42.789
I know you are, son.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.443
I just hope it's enough.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.469
So, corporate has decided

12:11.513 --> 12:13.776
to pull your ads, temporarily,

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
because of the DuBois situation,

12:16.823 --> 12:18.781
and if we don't respond
to this perfectly,

12:18.825 --> 12:19.913
it can become permanent.

12:19.956 --> 12:23.264
I understand.
So, I'll just...

12:23.307 --> 12:24.874
I'm gonna have to get back
into the studio,

12:24.918 --> 12:26.963
drop a record and change
the conversation.

12:27.007 --> 12:30.793
Okay, but any music you put out
right now will be tainted,

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
and so we've set up an interview

12:32.839 --> 12:34.449
with Robin Roberts

12:34.492 --> 12:36.712
so that you can apologize
for your actions.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.019
Wait, apolo...
[scoffs]

12:39.062 --> 12:41.586
Why? Y'all do know
that if it wasn't for me

12:41.630 --> 12:43.850
a whole other human being
would be-would be dead.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.678
No, honey, I know that.
We-we all know that.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.985
It's just that corporate

12:49.029 --> 12:52.641
doesn't want consumers
thinking about murder

12:52.684 --> 12:54.425
when they're picking out
their toaster.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.427
-That's all. -Well, tell you
what. Tell corporate to find

12:56.471 --> 12:58.908
another artist that's willing
to tap dance. It ain't me.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.301
Honey, it really isn't personal.
It's just that...

13:00.344 --> 13:01.911
COOKIE [over speaker]: Boy,
do you know how much revenue

13:01.955 --> 13:04.958
Empire's corporate partners
generate?

13:05.001 --> 13:08.875
Wait, I'm sorry... Wha... Mom?

13:08.918 --> 13:11.399
Aren't you supposed
to be resting?

13:11.442 --> 13:12.704
Don't make me use

13:12.748 --> 13:14.228
-my heart attack
-[mouthing silently]

13:14.271 --> 13:15.838
to guilt you into this, boy.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.973
Jewish mothers
ain't got nothing on Cookie.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.192
Yeah, all right. Fine,
but I'm not happy about it.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.890
You ain't got to be.
Love you.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.979
All right. We're done, guys.
Thank you.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.894
[indistinct chatter]

13:29.765 --> 13:32.333
[sighs]
This woman...

13:34.988 --> 13:38.513
I heard she was rolling calls
from the ER.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.429
I swear if I even think
about her in that hospital bed,

13:41.472 --> 13:44.432
-I'll never stop.
-Yeah.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.826
How you holding up?

13:50.264 --> 13:53.876
My situation is
not getting any easier,

13:53.920 --> 13:57.880
but I have decided to terminate.

13:59.055 --> 14:02.363
You still not gonna tell
J Poppa?

14:02.406 --> 14:04.104
[clicks tongue]

14:04.147 --> 14:05.888
I really don't see
what good telling him

14:05.932 --> 14:08.108
would do for him--
or me, for that matter.

14:08.151 --> 14:11.024
And since this is my body,
it's my choice.

14:11.067 --> 14:14.027
Absolutely.
I completely agree.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.551
I'm just saying, are you really
gonna be able to work with him,

14:16.594 --> 14:17.595
keeping that type of secret?

14:17.639 --> 14:19.597
I'm not keeping a secret.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.164
I'm actually
just keeping it private.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.600
That's it.
It's private.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.168
And I know that you are fragile
right now, but so am I.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.778
And I really cannot have
this fight with you anymore

14:26.822 --> 14:28.476
-'cause the thing is
-No, no, no. Stop. Come on.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.781
-I've already made my decision.
It's... -I promise you.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.131
No, I promise.
I know. I'm not...

14:31.174 --> 14:32.828
I'm not trying to fight.
Uh-uh.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.612
I'm actually just letting you
know that you don't have

14:34.656 --> 14:36.614
to have it all handled,
and it's okay

14:36.658 --> 14:39.313
for Boss Becky to be scared.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.273
[clicks tongue]
Thank you, Jamal,

14:43.317 --> 14:45.797
but Boss Becky
ain't never scared.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.371
TIANA:
You said no collaborations.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.505
It's practically
a bonus track, T.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.986
-Then why do it?
-[groans]

15:00.029 --> 15:01.335
Plus he's gonna probably
think this means

15:01.378 --> 15:03.163
I want to get back together.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.555
[chuckling]:
Okay.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.297
If we make the best possible
Tiana-Hakeem duet

15:07.341 --> 15:10.561
and it still pales in comparison
to your solo outings,

15:10.605 --> 15:13.869
no one will be able to deny that
you're Empire's reigning star.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.787
Besides...

15:18.830 --> 15:20.832
Cookie asked us to.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.837
I'll do it for Cookie.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.187
Mm-hmm.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.058
But on one condition.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.669
I am not gonna record
in the same booth as Hakeem.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.367
Him and all of his problems
can go work themselves out

15:33.410 --> 15:35.978
in one of the smaller studios.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.197
All right.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.506
Getting kind of tough.

15:46.249 --> 15:49.339
Cookie, this is Micah.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.775
He's your new personal chef.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.429
I understand that we're making

15:52.473 --> 15:54.475
some heart-healthy
dietary changes.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.260
This is a simple
antioxidant kale salad.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.393
Now, if you notice,
we have three juices here...

15:59.436 --> 16:03.092
Eh. Can you take that kale down
to Juanita and have her fry it?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.441
LUCIOUS: Come on.
Will you give him a chance?

16:04.485 --> 16:06.052
This is what the doctor
said you should be eating.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.185
Oh, so you talking to my doctors
without me now?

16:11.231 --> 16:13.885
Micah, will you give us
a moment?

16:13.929 --> 16:16.584
You gonna have to do better
than that, Micah.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.847
I ain't no damn rabbit.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.370
You're not
taking this seriously.

16:20.414 --> 16:23.243
You won't even give me
a chance to help you.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.027
I don't need you to help me,
Lucious.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.290
I can help myself and everybody
else like I've always done.

16:27.334 --> 16:31.294
Don't need no Nurse Claudia
helping me through this.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.520
ANDRE:
We need to talk, Shine.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.827
What are you still doing here?

16:42.871 --> 16:46.483
I thought your crazy ass
was put on sabbatical.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.485
I told Lucious everything.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.710
About me.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.190
That I tried to kill him,

16:57.233 --> 16:59.714
that the car bomb
was all my fault.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.064
I left your name out of it.

17:02.108 --> 17:05.285
They finally lobotomize you
or should I?

17:10.986 --> 17:13.771
No more, Shine.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.340
No more yelling.
No more threats.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.734
No more blood.

17:19.777 --> 17:23.346
If I told my father your role,
he'd kill you,

17:23.390 --> 17:26.219
then somebody from your clan
would clap back

17:26.262 --> 17:28.221
and it wouldn't be over
until we were all dead.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.787
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

17:29.831 --> 17:32.268
I wiped your slate clean.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.491
Are we done with this?

17:43.497 --> 17:46.021
I need to hear you
say it, Shine.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.983
[sighs]

17:52.027 --> 17:53.072
We're done.

18:01.384 --> 18:04.213
CANDACE: Don't even think
about it, Loretha.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.393
Candace, what the hell
are you doing here?

18:10.437 --> 18:13.135
CAROL:
Lucious needed some backup.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
Ugh.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.182
And you know,
you really need to stop

18:16.225 --> 18:17.531
pushing yourself so hard, Cook.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.055
CANDACE:
A heart attack at your age?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.144
You're gonna mess around
and end up like Daddy.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.190
LUCIOUS: Wow, is that not
the sweet sound

18:24.233 --> 18:27.018
of sirens that I hear?

18:27.062 --> 18:29.717
And I thought I told you
not to call them.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.545
Yeah, well,
you wouldn't listen to me,

18:31.588 --> 18:35.026
so I decided to call in
some reinforcements.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.376
Ladies, you know the rules.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.377
Yes, Lucious.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.074
No red meat, no cheeses.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.076
CAROL: Yep. No liquor...
[chuckles]

18:41.120 --> 18:44.297
...for her. No carbs and a whole
lot of water. We got this.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.994
I'll leave y'all to it.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.996
Don't be surprised
if I'm the only one still alive

18:48.039 --> 18:50.346
when you get back.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.785
I hear I have you to thank for
Shine handing over his numbers.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.874
Well, he was underreporting
his sales figures.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.225
You know, Shine, you know, it's
a common occurrence around here,

18:59.268 --> 19:01.314
but I took the measure
to keep it from happening again.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.445
Everything's detailed there.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.624
Thank you.
I will miss you around here.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.452
Well, actually, Eddie,

19:09.496 --> 19:11.193
actually, um...

19:11.237 --> 19:14.240
[chuckles] ...as I was checking
Shine's math,

19:14.283 --> 19:15.328
there was something
I couldn't figure out.

19:15.371 --> 19:17.591
It's a small thing.
Um...

19:17.634 --> 19:19.114
why did you need his numbers

19:19.158 --> 19:20.681
to move forward
with the phone deal?

19:20.724 --> 19:24.685
I love that you don't even allow
even the smallest detail

19:24.728 --> 19:26.339
to go unnoticed, Andre.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.255
You're exactly
what this company needs

19:29.298 --> 19:32.258
if it's gonna move forward
in this marketplace.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.998
I don't know what Empire's
gonna do when you're not here.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.043
Thank you.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.827
Thank you very much for that.

19:36.871 --> 19:40.614
I appreciate that, but, uh,
doesn't answer my question.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.659
What's this really about, Eddie?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.272
I'm not sure
I know what you mean,

19:46.315 --> 19:50.406
but I do know this...

19:52.452 --> 19:55.368
...it's a shame.
Really.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.414
It's a damn shame that
your parents didn't allow you

19:58.458 --> 20:01.156
to run this company.
Because with your brains,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.462
there's no limit

20:02.505 --> 20:05.291
to what you could achieve.

20:05.334 --> 20:08.598
Thank you, my brother.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.861
You outdid yourself on this.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.042
-Hey, sis.
-Yes.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.653
I wasn't sure
which one you wanted,

20:19.696 --> 20:21.742
-so I just grabbed all of them.
-Ooh, that's amazing.

20:21.785 --> 20:25.049
All right.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.313
You know, this is ridiculous.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.838
They expect you to buy
a new cord every six months

20:30.881 --> 20:33.493
when they come out
with some new gidgy-gadget.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.711
Bigger scam than the drug game.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.497
[laughs]
You ain't never lie.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.325
Doesn't look like resting to me.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.717
Don't you see me in bed?

20:40.761 --> 20:43.285
CANDACE:
Well, I'll take this

20:43.329 --> 20:44.634
and this and this.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.636
-Oh, and especially this.
-No, no.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.159
G-G-Give me that.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.378
Give me the phone, Loretha.

20:49.422 --> 20:50.640
Kiss my ass, Candace.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.555
CAROL: All right.
Can you guys please stop it?

20:52.599 --> 20:53.861
-She just had a heart attack.
-COOKIE: Yes.

20:53.904 --> 20:54.949
CAROL: Okay, all we got to do
is keep her alive

20:54.992 --> 20:56.994
until Lucious gets back.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.779
If she wants to do a little
bit of work, it's on her.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.912
-She a grown-ass woman. -I'm
a grown-ass woman over here.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.393
I know it's in our DNA
to take care of everything

21:04.437 --> 21:07.309
and everybody,
but you have got to learn

21:07.353 --> 21:09.224
to put you first for once.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.660
-It's called self-care.
-COOKIE: Okay.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.446
-Look it up!
-I will, soon as I find a cord.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.404
Self-care?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.145
[mocking]:
I just want a little self-care.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.886
[normal voice]: That is some
rich, white-woman nonsense.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.757
Maybe that's why they
live longer than us, Carol.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.412
Uh, no. They live longer than us

21:23.456 --> 21:26.110
because they have all the wealth
and the insurance.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.112
I know.
That's why I married one.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.724
-Oh, you married a white woman?
-[Carol and Cookie laughing]

21:30.767 --> 21:32.595
CANDACE:
You know what I meant.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.944
Okay, y'all sit on over there

21:33.988 --> 21:35.946
and act childish
and irresponsible.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.514
Maybe Mom should be here.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.475
She heard what happened.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.737
She wants to see you.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.828
I don't care.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.351
That bitch left us.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.355
I don't want nothin'
to do with her.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.488
I don't know why y'all still
dealing with her.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.706
Because she's our mother.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.405
Okay, Candace.
You know what?

21:59.448 --> 22:01.189
I'm-a need you to leave,

22:01.232 --> 22:04.235
'cause you finna give me another
heart attack.

22:04.279 --> 22:08.762
-Yeah, I feel my blood rising
right now. -Fine.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.851
-I'll go.
-COOKIE: Thank you.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.505
But I'm taking your gadgets
with me.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.028
Sorry about the plug.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.639
You just let her get away
with everything.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.424
I don't need these now.

22:20.817 --> 22:23.864
And so the whole team agrees
that it would be really,

22:23.907 --> 22:26.388
really great if you start...

22:26.432 --> 22:29.609
testing out headlining
in some larger markets,

22:29.652 --> 22:32.176
but also we don't want to
neglect the opportunity

22:32.220 --> 22:35.919
to have you open up for some
more... established acts.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.227
All right.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.450
Do you maybe want to pretend

22:44.493 --> 22:48.279
to be invested in your career?

22:48.323 --> 22:52.022
Oh, I'm sorry,
I'm not excited to be here

22:52.066 --> 22:54.111
while you gloat
about dumping me.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.462
I am not gloating about any...

22:56.505 --> 22:58.464
This is really awkward
for me, too, okay?

22:58.507 --> 22:59.552
So let's just get through this.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.467
No, we can't just finish,

23:01.510 --> 23:03.338
because I can't pretend
like you.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.818
I need to understand
what happened.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.475
Sometimes relationships
don't work out, okay?

23:09.518 --> 23:10.650
It is what it is.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.478
Our relationship was perfect.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.436
It was better than ever.
You know it was!

23:14.480 --> 23:16.264
Our relationship was great,

23:16.307 --> 23:18.484
and ever since you've ended
things with me, Becky,

23:18.527 --> 23:20.442
my brain has been on a loop.

23:20.486 --> 23:24.664
I can't eat.
I can't write, Becky.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.101
What did I do?

23:27.144 --> 23:28.624
-Just tell me.
-You know, I actually have

23:28.668 --> 23:30.496
a lot of meetings to do today,

23:30.539 --> 23:32.367
so can we just...

23:32.411 --> 23:34.935
I'm pregnant.

23:42.725 --> 23:43.726
What?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.516
I'm pregnant.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.693
You're pregnant?

24:03.224 --> 24:05.618
Okay.

24:05.661 --> 24:06.923
Okay... We could be...
We could figure this...

24:06.967 --> 24:08.708
No, no, no...
Don't, don't, don't, don't,

24:08.751 --> 24:12.102
don't start planning anything,
because...

24:12.146 --> 24:14.104
I'm not keeping it.

24:18.718 --> 24:21.764
I don't get to have a say?

24:21.808 --> 24:24.854
You know, I-I knew that this
would be really hard on you,

24:24.898 --> 24:26.203
and that's why I didn't want
to tell you,

24:26.247 --> 24:27.683
but I can't be pregnant
right now.

24:27.727 --> 24:30.381
I can't have a kid.
I'm sorry.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.912
Don't walk away from me
right now. Don't...

24:44.047 --> 24:46.223
[sighs]
Damn it.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.098
[record playing over phone]:
â™ª Big shoes, big shoesâ™ª

24:51.141 --> 24:53.796
â™ª My new one got some
really big shoes to fillâ™ª

24:53.840 --> 24:55.624
â™ª Made moves, made movesâ™ª

24:55.668 --> 24:58.366
â™ª I moved on but I think
about you for real...â™ª

24:58.409 --> 25:00.586
Porsha, turn it off.
Turn it off!

25:00.629 --> 25:03.240
Why did Eddie change
the song, hmm?

25:03.284 --> 25:06.766
No, you tell him
he needs to call me and get...

25:06.809 --> 25:09.290
I got to call you back.
I'm about to get phone-checked.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.598
Why are you standing there
looking like that?

25:12.641 --> 25:14.817
I still have a company to run.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.558
Give it here.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.604
What?

25:18.647 --> 25:21.694
Man...

25:21.737 --> 25:24.392
You got five seconds to get back
in that bed before I raise hell.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.702
ROBIN ROBERTS:
This video

25:29.745 --> 25:31.834
of you beating your boyfriend,

25:31.878 --> 25:33.619
Warren Hall--
Everyone's seen it.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.838
-It's gone viral.
-Yeah, um...

25:35.882 --> 25:37.623
JAMAL [on video]:
Why?! Huh? Huh?!

25:37.666 --> 25:40.016
Maybe we could, uh...

25:40.060 --> 25:42.236
-we could stop playing it,
please? -Oh, sure.

25:44.325 --> 25:48.155
But you know that was followed
by your involvement

25:48.198 --> 25:51.506
in the shooting death
of former New York City

25:51.550 --> 25:54.640
mayoral candidate Angelo DuBois.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.946
So how do you explain
all this violence?

25:56.990 --> 26:00.036
Well, first of all, that was
self-defense. You know?

26:00.080 --> 26:03.823
Uh, but it certainly was a-an
unfortunate set of events

26:03.866 --> 26:04.824
that took place.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.608
But I think, honestly, if you...

26:06.652 --> 26:08.001
if you talked to anybody
that knows me,

26:08.044 --> 26:09.872
they would all say that
I'm not a violent person.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.875
I'm-I'm sorry, Jamal.
I got to stop you there,

26:12.919 --> 26:15.443
because the evidence
indicates otherwise,

26:15.486 --> 26:17.880
and I want to ask you this.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.535
Have you ever considered anger
management counseling?

26:20.579 --> 26:21.667
No.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.669
I'm sorry.

26:23.712 --> 26:26.193
I think that what I would want

26:26.236 --> 26:27.890
everybody to know about me,

26:27.934 --> 26:29.631
-Robin, is that,
-Okay.

26:29.675 --> 26:30.850
uh...

26:30.893 --> 26:34.070
Um...

26:34.114 --> 26:36.899
[whispering]:
When you're born into

26:36.943 --> 26:38.640
a certain set
of circumstances...

26:38.684 --> 26:43.645
When you're born into a certain
set of circumstances,

26:43.689 --> 26:47.257
you, uh...

26:47.301 --> 26:50.260
you just, you...

26:50.304 --> 26:51.958
[Jamal sighs]

26:54.134 --> 26:56.266
I'm sorry.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.921
I have rehearsed
all of this foolishness

26:58.965 --> 27:00.270
with-with all of my handlers,

27:00.314 --> 27:03.360
you know,
but-but it's just not true.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.711
-So, what is true?
-What's true is that

27:05.754 --> 27:07.800
the entire DuBois family
tried to take mine down.

27:07.843 --> 27:11.368
And I mean
literally take us down.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.719
You know, so, yes,
Angelo DuBois is dead,

27:13.762 --> 27:15.372
but I would be lying
if I said that I was sorry about

27:15.416 --> 27:17.679
something that
he brought on himself.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.550
You know,
I almost lost my brother,

27:19.594 --> 27:21.465
but I don't see none of
the press talking about this.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.729
Like, not once. And most
recently I almost lost

27:23.772 --> 27:25.818
the person that literally
means more to me

27:25.861 --> 27:28.734
than anybody in the world.
So, you know,

27:28.777 --> 27:31.301
what I've learned
is that life is very short,

27:31.345 --> 27:33.477
and I'm just, uh...
I don't know.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.611
I just... I'm... I'm done.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.352
I'm done with all of this,
and-and I apologize,

27:38.395 --> 27:41.485
because I respect you a great
deal, but I'm-I'm done.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.965
I'm done apologizing, I'm done
doing stupid interviews,

27:43.009 --> 27:45.968
-and I don't want to it.
-ROBIN: Guess we are done.

27:46.012 --> 27:49.102
That boy had one damn job.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.756
[chuckles]

27:53.802 --> 27:55.064
[exhales heavily]

27:55.108 --> 27:57.763
You are exhausting me, Loretha.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.547
Why must you be
so damn stubborn?

27:59.590 --> 28:02.376
Jamal just embarrassed himself
on national TV.

28:02.419 --> 28:05.988
Look, that song that Hakeem
and Tiana got ain't tracking.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.121
I... Empire just ain't gonna
make it without me.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.862
Now, it pains me to say this,

28:09.905 --> 28:11.777
but Lucious knows
what he is doing.

28:11.820 --> 28:15.084
You are not leaving this house
to fix some song. Back in bed.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.564
You pain my ass.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.131
-Well, back in bed.
-You're a pain in my...

28:18.174 --> 28:19.785
-B-Back in bed.
-You know what, Cookie,

28:19.828 --> 28:21.787
back in the day, you didn't need
no little fancy studio

28:21.830 --> 28:23.136
to make good music.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.094
You did it right in my garage,
remember that?

28:25.138 --> 28:27.096
-So?
-So? So, maybe you need to

28:27.140 --> 28:29.751
think outside the box
on this one.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.840
What have I told you about
enabling her behavior?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.799
CAROL: Look, it ain't no use
in trying to fight it.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.365
She gon' do what she gon' do.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.150
Plus, I already looked up
her little symptoms

28:37.193 --> 28:39.979
on that WebMD thing, and she
need to walk her ass around.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.198
-Get up and walk. Walk.
-No, she does not... No!

28:42.242 --> 28:44.766
Are you crazy?
No, you do not. Stop.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.203
-Carol is right.
-Thank you.

28:47.247 --> 28:49.815
[scoffs] "Carol is right,"
said no one ever.

28:49.858 --> 28:52.600
If I can't go to Empire,

28:52.643 --> 28:54.297
then Empire's coming to me.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.006
Juanita, what in the hell
is all those trucks

29:07.049 --> 29:08.659
-doing in my driveway?
-I wanted to call you,

29:08.703 --> 29:11.010
but Miss Cookie wouldn't let me.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.229
Look, uh, can you put those two
mics closer together?

29:13.273 --> 29:15.405
-Okay. -They might not fit,
but we can make it work.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.798
What are you doing?

29:16.842 --> 29:19.235
I'm saving Tiana's album.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.804
Look, this place is not gonna
fall apart in a week

29:22.848 --> 29:25.285
if you're just resting--
it's worked for 17 years.

29:25.328 --> 29:28.636
I know, Lucious.
Please, let me do... Oh.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.072
I tried to stop her.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.509
Don't look like you tried
hard enough.

29:32.553 --> 29:36.426
Okay, what you are not gonna do
is disappear all day,

29:36.470 --> 29:38.951
and then come back in here
and criticize a person

29:38.994 --> 29:40.953
-that's been holding down
the fort. -This ain't no fort!

29:40.996 --> 29:43.694
-She's supposed to be
in bed resting!-Excuse me.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.958
Look, if you can't do
what I asked you to do,

29:46.001 --> 29:47.873
-maybe you need to get the hell
on out of here. -Whoa, whoa.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.875
Don't be hollering
at my sister like that.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.660
We dropped everything to come
over here and help your ass out.

29:52.703 --> 29:53.922
This is the thanks we get?

29:53.966 --> 29:55.663
You haven't done
anything, Carol.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.970
I'm the one that's been trying
to get her back in bed.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.885
All you've been talking
about is, "Cookie gon' do

29:59.928 --> 30:01.408
-what Cookie gon' do." You...
-COOKIE: Candace,

30:01.451 --> 30:02.670
I'm-a need you to calm down

30:02.713 --> 30:04.063
before you pass out.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.847
Now, look,

30:05.891 --> 30:08.415
I have better doctors
than Daddy had, okay?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.852
I'm-a be all right.

30:10.896 --> 30:11.984
I-I'm not doing this
for anybody else.

30:12.027 --> 30:14.116
I'm doing this for me.
See...

30:14.160 --> 30:17.903
this music is what's
gonna heal me.

30:17.946 --> 30:21.950
Please, Lucious. Please.

30:24.735 --> 30:25.867
You get one song.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.042
One song. That's all I need.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.261
Thank you.
Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.045
'Cause all your arguing

30:30.089 --> 30:31.525
-is gonna give me
another heart attack.
-That's it.

30:34.789 --> 30:37.618
[indistinct chatter]

30:48.716 --> 30:51.110
Say something.

30:51.153 --> 30:54.504
Okay, um...
What do you want me to say?

30:54.548 --> 30:57.899
Uh, I don't know.
Say something distracting.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.032
Uh, talk about work.
I don't care.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.339
I'm sorry that I ruined
the interview for you.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.603
I'm not really that sorry.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.301
I probably ruined my career,
though, 'cause I'm free now.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.957
Okay. Well,
I'm free to never book

31:12.000 --> 31:14.133
another live interview for you
ever again.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.526
-Deal. I didn't want to do it
to begin with. -Never.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.355
Rebecca Williams? Hi.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.968
Just remember it's your choice.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.926
You can go in there,
or we can get the car.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.060
It's whatever.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.452
I'm here.

31:33.108 --> 31:34.066
If you want me to be.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.719
What are you doing here?

31:35.763 --> 31:38.722
I prayed on this,

31:38.766 --> 31:41.116
and I do not agree with what
you are doing, but Becky...

31:41.160 --> 31:43.336
Of course, I...

31:43.379 --> 31:46.513
...I love you,
and I do not want you

31:46.556 --> 31:48.341
to go through this without me.

31:56.827 --> 31:59.047
BECKY:
Thank you.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.532
Okay.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.273
I'll be waiting.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.845
We're gonna come right in here.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.849
Are you sure about this, Cookie?

32:18.893 --> 32:21.026
I am positive.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.245
You are not going to get
the same outcome

32:23.289 --> 32:25.378
if y'all are not
in the same room,

32:25.421 --> 32:27.467
feeding off of each other.

I'm okay, boy.
Stop overreacting.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.432
Mom, you can't work.

33:19.475 --> 33:20.955
The doctor said you're supposed
to be resting right now.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.522

33:22.565 --> 33:25.046

Boy, finish the song,

Why the 911 text?

35:16.462 --> 35:18.812
Did Lupe pull out of the deal?

35:18.855 --> 35:21.989
I called his overpaid ass.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.382
I told him we weren't selling.

35:23.425 --> 35:25.210
Why in the hell
would you do that?

35:25.253 --> 35:27.212
Your favorite.

35:27.255 --> 35:30.171
W-We can't afford that anymore.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.955
We're celebrating.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.436
Celebrating what?

35:34.480 --> 35:37.004
I got the final piece
of the puzzle.

35:37.047 --> 35:39.485
We're about to be flush
with cash.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.185
Please tell me this is real.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.536
It's real.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.452
It's definitely real.

36:01.507 --> 36:04.031
I mean, it's not so bad.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.468
It could use
some bacon bits, though.

[Lucious chuckles]

36:07.295 --> 36:09.341
We need to talk.

-Not now, Andre.
-This can't wait, Pop.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.213
Okay? Now, listen to me.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.998
I've been going over the Patel
deal Eddie's been running.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.044
Hey, hey, hey, Andre,
nobody asked you to do that.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.350
Be glad I did, Ma.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.265
You let Eddie into Empire

36:20.308 --> 36:22.876
and he is about to steal it
from under you.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.234
You guys wanted to see me?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.280
What's going on?

36:35.323 --> 36:36.629
You feeling okay, Cook?

36:36.672 --> 36:39.022
Um, Andre tells us

36:39.066 --> 36:41.111
that, uh, the numbers

36:41.155 --> 36:45.028
you're looking at are way
too expansive for a phone deal.

36:45.072 --> 36:48.249
He thinks you're putting
together a portfolio

36:48.293 --> 36:51.339
to make Empire
look attractive to a buyer.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.254
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, now, I was telling Cookie

36:53.298 --> 36:55.343
earlier that I think...
[laughs]

36:55.387 --> 36:57.606
...that's-that's insane, right?

36:57.650 --> 36:59.217
Eddie?
It's crazy, right?

37:01.175 --> 37:04.134
I wanted to be the one
to tell you. [chuckles]

37:04.178 --> 37:06.746
But shame on me
for-for thinking that I could

37:06.789 --> 37:08.965
hide something
from your number one son.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.489
He's right?

37:10.532 --> 37:13.927
This is great news, great news.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.321
Kelly Patel is putting together

37:16.364 --> 37:20.150
a formal offer to buy Empire.

37:20.194 --> 37:23.328
His company wants to, uh,
break into the creative space,

37:23.371 --> 37:26.679
and I was able to get them
to agree to a dollar amount

37:26.722 --> 37:29.334
that you wouldn't even believe.

37:29.377 --> 37:32.511
I'm really confused, Eddie.

37:32.554 --> 37:35.514
Because you were the one

37:35.557 --> 37:39.169
who convinced me not
to sell Empire XStream, so...

37:39.213 --> 37:40.301
A different situation.

37:40.345 --> 37:41.520
You were gonna gut the company.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.871
This-this deal
helps to keep it together,

37:44.914 --> 37:47.526
with the two of you
still in charge.

37:47.569 --> 37:50.529
Wait, but, wait, who in the hell
gave you permission

37:50.572 --> 37:53.358
to make deals on my behalf?

37:53.401 --> 37:56.535
Don't let your ego
get in the way of this deal.

37:56.578 --> 37:59.364
Oh. Myego.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.453
Maybe you should
check yours right now.

38:01.496 --> 38:02.541
You know what?

38:02.584 --> 38:05.021
This is a now or never
opportunity.

38:05.065 --> 38:08.024
Well, then, it's easy for us,
'cause it's never.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.157
-Nev... what are you talk...
Seriously?
-ANDRE: Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.593
Eddie, look,
it's a good deal on paper.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.465
No, it's a great deal...
G-Get your hands off of me.

38:13.508 --> 38:16.816
-[sighs]
-I was out there,
living my life.

38:16.859 --> 38:19.732
Happily retired.

38:19.775 --> 38:23.213
And you guys,
you-you pulled me back in.

38:23.257 --> 38:26.913
And, like a fool, I said yes.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.958
And then I negotiate a deal

38:29.002 --> 38:32.788
that would make Empire
bigger than ever,

38:32.832 --> 38:35.922
and y'all don't even want
to consider it.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.619
Eddie, you gonna have to tell me
where all this is coming from.

38:37.663 --> 38:40.579
Let me talk, I'm trying to tell
you where it's coming from.

38:40.622 --> 38:44.583
I stepped in when you needed me.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.716
I saved your ass.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.153
And after months-- months--

38:50.197 --> 38:52.242
of damn near killing myself
to save this company,

38:52.286 --> 38:55.333
y'all won't even give me
the benefit of the doubt.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.645
Or is the problem
that you're scared?

39:03.689 --> 39:07.780
-[scoffs]
-You want to keep
this company small

39:07.823 --> 39:10.565
'cause the thought of having
to compete with the big boys...

39:10.609 --> 39:12.393
-COOKIE: Hey, uh...
-[claps hands]

39:12.437 --> 39:13.655
Watch your mouth, Eddie.

39:13.699 --> 39:14.526
[chuckles]

39:14.569 --> 39:16.484
Empire ain't small.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.660
Yeah, but it's nothing compared
to what it could be, Cook.

39:18.704 --> 39:21.533
I'm on the phone every damn day,
talking to these major labels.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.666
And they laugh at this place.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.625
You should hear what
these white folks are saying

39:26.668 --> 39:27.800
behind your back.

39:27.843 --> 39:30.063
They think that Empire
is a joke.

39:30.106 --> 39:34.023
And y'all ain't nothing but
a bunch of shucking and jiving

39:34.067 --> 39:36.025
North Philly monkeys to them.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.636
Okay.

39:42.858 --> 39:46.035
And you know what?
I-I...

39:46.079 --> 39:49.604
If you don't take this deal,

39:49.648 --> 39:52.346
maybe they're right.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.003
Well, you know what, Eddie,
because you and me,

39:57.046 --> 40:00.833
we're... we're old friends,

40:00.876 --> 40:02.487
I think that maybe
you're just, um...

40:02.530 --> 40:05.707
you're tired,
and you need some rest.

40:05.751 --> 40:08.667
So, as your friend,

40:08.710 --> 40:10.495
I'm going to give you
ten seconds

40:10.538 --> 40:13.062
to get the hell out of my house.

40:25.118 --> 40:28.513
I need to fly out
to Palo Alto tonight.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.820
Better that I, uh, give the
bad news to Kelly Patel myself.

40:31.864 --> 40:35.171
COOKIE: That's a good idea,
Eddie, and you know what?

40:35.215 --> 40:38.131
While you're there, why don't
you take some time for yourself?

40:38.174 --> 40:41.134
You know?
Get some rest.

40:41.177 --> 40:43.310
-Yeah.
-COOKIE: Take a couple days off.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.617
Mm-hmm? Relax.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.494
Track him, Thirsty.

40:53.538 --> 40:55.409
I want to know the moment
he gets his black ass

40:55.453 --> 40:56.889
on that plane to San Francisco.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.412
LUCIOUS:
Hey, wait, wait.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.979
Andre's already
taking care of that.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.197
Cook, will you
get off the phone?

41:01.241 --> 41:02.938
You text me
with any updates, okay?

41:02.982 --> 41:04.287
Will you hang up the phone?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.942
[sighs]
This is all my fault.

41:06.986 --> 41:09.641
I let him in.

41:09.684 --> 41:13.296
So it's up to me to make sure
that door closes behind him.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.646
[sighs]

41:14.689 --> 41:16.648
I'll see what I can do
about Jamal in the morning.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.780
I should've been there for
that Robin Roberts interview.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.434
Will you stop?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.131
Honey, there's nothing left

41:22.175 --> 41:24.960
for you to fix--
you fixed everything all day.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.659
There's... The only thing
you won't fix is yourself.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.008
-I mean, look at me.
-So much to do...

41:29.051 --> 41:31.576
I've been sitting here,
worried about you,

41:31.619 --> 41:33.186
-'cause you keep
pushing yourself...
-It's okay.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.580
-...and pushing yourself
into the...
-It's okay.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.582
You're in the...

41:37.625 --> 41:39.671
[texting]

41:41.716 --> 41:42.674
It's all right, you know?

41:42.717 --> 41:44.545
Your sister was right.

41:44.589 --> 41:47.113
Cookie does what Cookie does,

41:47.156 --> 41:49.376
and that's all that Cookie does.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.683
Regardless of who
she leaves behind,

41:51.726 --> 41:55.774
even though
you're the love of my l...

41:55.817 --> 41:58.211
[exhales]

41:58.254 --> 42:00.605
You need to get some rest, baby.

42:02.737 --> 42:03.999
[exhales]

42:09.657 --> 42:11.659
Baby.

42:11.703 --> 42:15.271
I just need some sleep,
that's all.

42:18.666 --> 42:22.409
I don't want to die, Lucious.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.367
I don't want to die.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.935
I just got everything back.

42:26.979 --> 42:29.677
I got you back, I got
my family back, I got my life,

42:29.721 --> 42:32.637
and I-I... I'm not...
I'm not ready to leave it.

42:32.680 --> 42:36.075
I got too much to do, Lucious,
I got too much love to give.

42:36.118 --> 42:39.687
I'm not... I-I don't want to...
I'm... I'm so scared, Lucious.
