00:04.400 --> 00:09.400
Paper money is bigger
than metal money.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.400
Nine comes after eight.

00:13.900 --> 00:18.700
And Spring comes after Winter,
right, Black?

00:19.100 --> 00:21.400
Ls that right?

00:30.200 --> 00:35.700
Black, when the sky turns black...

00:36.800 --> 00:41.700
...why do l feel so blue?

00:51.900 --> 00:55.600
<i>What is it about the fire?</i>

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
<i>So calm and peaceful but...</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:04.700
<i>... inside, all power and destruction.</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:12.300
<i>It's hiding something.</i>
<i>Just like people do.</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:18.800
<i>Sometimes you have to get close</i>
<i>to find out what's inside.</i>

01:20.500 --> 01:26.800
<i>Sometimes you have to get burned</i>
<i>to see the truth.</i>

01:29.900 --> 01:33.300
C'mon, White. It's playtime.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.100
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

02:00.600 --> 02:06.000
<i>It's Japan, Planet Earth calling, Agent</i>
<i>White reporting. Do you read me?</i>

02:06.200 --> 02:10.900
<i>This is a very peaceful planet.</i>

02:11.300 --> 02:13.900
<i>Agent White, keeping the peace,</i>
<i>doing my best to fight the bad guys...</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.400
<i>... wherever they may be. Over and out.</i>

02:19.100 --> 02:23.900
<i>Itchy, itchy, scratchy, scratchy</i>
<i>Oh, l got one down my back-y</i>

02:26.900 --> 02:31.900
Lately folks don't come 'round.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.700
There it is, Brother Dusk,
Treasure Town!

02:43.700 --> 02:46.800
Lt's all Cats' turf up ahead,
Brother Dawn.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.500
Treasure Town has a certain
<i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

02:59.200 --> 03:02.700
A never-never land if you will.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.900
It's become such a wholesome town.
Boo-hoo!

03:32.300 --> 03:34.700
Kimura.

03:34.900 --> 03:37.000
Here, Mr. Suzuki.

03:39.600 --> 03:43.200
Spread some poison around here.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.400
Yes, sir.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.100
The Rat's back.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.800
Oh, White!

04:04.100 --> 04:07.300
How tough are the Cats?

04:07.700 --> 04:12.100
Heard talk about leaping over
buildings and killing people.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.900
Legendary stuff.

04:16.800 --> 04:23.600
Chinese monkeys can ride on clouds.
Know that?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.000
Sawada.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.100
Heard you graduated
from Tokyo University.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.100
Yeah, passed the National Security test
and wanted to see some action.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.400
This town's rough. Full of liars.

04:46.900 --> 04:48.400
L ain't lying.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.400
No problem. Besides, l'm frigid.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.400
Never even had an orgasm.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.900
Hey, l'm the victim here!

05:00.600 --> 05:02.500
Orgasm.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.500
Call me White.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.400
Money please!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.700
Weird hat, kid.

05:10.900 --> 05:12.300
You the boss around here?

05:12.500 --> 05:15.100
Do you know the Cats?

05:17.800 --> 05:20.400
Did you say cats?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.900
Yeah. Rumor is they rule this town.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.900
We've got cats.
Spotted ones, striped ones. Lots.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.100
Know dat?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.500
What're you doing here?

05:38.600 --> 05:40.500
We're taking over here.

05:40.700 --> 05:44.300
Gonna kick the Cats out...

05:44.500 --> 05:46.700
...and rule Treasure Town.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.700
So you're bad guys are you?

05:50.900 --> 05:55.700
We're the Dusk and Dawn brothers.
We rule Yutaka City.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.200
Give us a call if you need a hand.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.300
Cat! He's a Cat!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.300
Cats?

06:17.200 --> 06:19.100
What cats?

06:19.500 --> 06:22.100
New here, are you?

06:24.300 --> 06:30.500
Strays. Orphans. Delinquents who rule
Treasure Town.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.100
<i>They can fly.</i>

06:34.300 --> 06:37.800
<i>They live by the law</i>
<i>of the jungle.</i>

06:39.000 --> 06:40.300
<i>This city is their playground.</i>

06:40.600 --> 06:42.500
<i>Underestimate them</i>
<i>and you'll kiss asphalt.</i>

06:42.700 --> 06:45.900
L hate this town.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.400
Oh, baby.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.000
L said wait!

06:58.800 --> 07:02.400
Picking a fight and running away,
how lame is that.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.200
Running isn't going
to get us anywhere.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.200
Acting cool isn't gonna help.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.300
We've got to split them up or else.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.200
Eureka!

07:20.800 --> 07:22.800
White! How long is it until 5, White?

07:23.000 --> 07:27.200
What? L can't hear anything.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.700
Five o'clock, White. You got it? Five!

07:38.700 --> 07:39.900
Here we go.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.800
- One down.
- One to go.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.300
They're coming!

08:01.200 --> 08:02.300
Fast little guy!

08:11.800 --> 08:13.200
Look at him go!

08:14.400 --> 08:15.500
He got away.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.700
It's 'cause you're too slow.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.700
All right, l'm going!

08:55.900 --> 08:59.500
You can sure move.
But we've got you now.

09:04.300 --> 09:08.100
Give up the town
and we'll let you live.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.300
Almost 5.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Black planned Operation 5:00.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.700
He's smart.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.600
What the hell?!

09:59.900 --> 10:02.000
Dad, someone's up there.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
You're right.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.600
L know this place!

11:08.600 --> 11:13.500
Hello again, Agent White reporting in.
We're preparing to dive.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.700
Okay, take her down!

11:18.500 --> 11:22.100
Going under! And the time is?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.600
Hello, what time is it?

11:25.900 --> 11:27.000
Stop thief!

11:27.400 --> 11:30.500
The time at the tone is...

12:01.300 --> 12:03.300
Welcome home, Black.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.900
Today's loot.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.200
Many silver monies.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.800
When this piggy gets fat...

12:13.100 --> 12:15.600
...we'll ride in a airplane.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.300
Right, Black?

12:18.300 --> 12:23.700
Build a house on the beach.
That's the plan, right?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.500
We promised, right?

12:26.900 --> 12:29.500
Yeah, we promised.

12:42.500 --> 12:48.200
Hello, this is Japan, Planet Earth,
Agent White reporting.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.500
Do you read me?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.500
Unfortunately, your luck is waning.

12:55.700 --> 13:00.200
This is not a time to be greedy.
Maintain the status quo.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.800
What's that, Mr. Suzuki?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.200
The Rat.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.400
Kimura, you believe in astrology?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.900
L believe in nothing.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.200
Nothing, huh?

13:20.400 --> 13:26.700
At least believe in love Kimura.
Love is all you need.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.000
L thought l smelled something sour
in town.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.800
Well, if it isn't my old friend,
Fujimura.

13:39.500 --> 13:43.900
Nice little entourage, Rat.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.900
This town's about to buzz like
a bee hive poked with a stick.

13:50.200 --> 13:55.400
You'll regret being a cop
now that l'm back.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.900
L already do.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.300
Those yakuza got style.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.800
C'mon. We're outta here, White.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.200
What? The fight just started.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.200
Just come on.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.400
Get lots of money?

14:56.600 --> 14:59.100
Not so loud.

15:00.700 --> 15:01.700
Get lost!

15:02.200 --> 15:05.200
Sell your own stuff!

15:05.500 --> 15:06.700
C'mon, it's yakuza.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.100
Thanks for your generosity...

15:12.300 --> 15:14.600
...but you can take your stuff
and shove it!

15:15.100 --> 15:18.600
Of course, we'll compensate
you handsomely.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.600
Hey, you're not listening.
Take your yakuza crap and shove it.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.100
Relax.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.500
Local wiseguys, eh?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.400
We're the Apaches
and we run Treasure Town!

15:31.600 --> 15:34.100
Choco's the name so
don't forget it!

15:36.300 --> 15:38.100
Choco's on fire tonight.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.600
That yakuza...

15:41.800 --> 15:44.300
You... you gonna pop me?

15:48.100 --> 15:51.600
You talk the talk but
can you walk the walk?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.200
You threatening me?

15:54.700 --> 15:58.400
Try gettin' your hands dirty
once in a while.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.900
We do all the dirty work!
You listening!?

16:04.700 --> 16:08.900
- Got no ears!
- Or balls!

16:09.300 --> 16:10.600
Let's go.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Hey, Kimura.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.600
Go cry to momma!

16:15.800 --> 16:18.600
We're not even gonna rough them up?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.500
Shut up and get in.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.500
Suzuki won't like us
coming home empty-handed.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.800
L'm running the show today.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.600
Let's go.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.400
Go about your business.
And don't never come back.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.800
Awesome, Choco.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.000
You showed them!

16:47.200 --> 16:49.500
Hey, the little professor.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.900
Funny seeing you out this late.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.600
Nighttime makes me sad.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
Who was that Choco?

16:59.300 --> 17:02.000
Some punk named Kimura.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.599
Nothing we can't handle.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.099
Wow, White, you're getting too heavy.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.599
And you're gettin' big too.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.300
Kimura.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.700
Black...

17:19.900 --> 17:20.900
What?

17:21.099 --> 17:23.300
Suzuki said something about him.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.400
Some brat in Treasure Town.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.000
Likes the taste of blood.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.800
Pretty sure his name's...

17:34.100 --> 17:35.400
<i>... Black.</i>

17:37.600 --> 17:45.000
Hey, Black, nighttime is sad.
Guess it's because...

17:45.600 --> 17:52.200
...the dark makes me think about dying.

17:53.300 --> 17:55.300
Don't worry, White.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.600
Nobody will ever break us apart.

18:04.600 --> 18:10.100
Can't even make a living
exchanging bottles.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.100
Help a veteran?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.200
Spare change?

18:17.900 --> 18:20.100
Can you help a guy get a drink?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.800
Stinky old man.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.300
Don't touch me, freak.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.100
Gross!

18:34.100 --> 18:40.500
Back when l was in uniform,
this town had some warmth to it.

18:40.700 --> 18:44.800
Now, it's stone-cold.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.300
Cities have been cold...

18:48.500 --> 18:50.700
...since Hammurabi built Babylon.

18:51.700 --> 18:55.400
Nebuchadnezzar II built Babylon.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.600
Well, well, well...

19:01.400 --> 19:04.100
Fine work
you've been doing lately, Black.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.400
Why's the Rat back
in Treasure Town?

19:08.200 --> 19:11.800
The biggest star in the sky is the sun.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.400
Did you know that?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.800
L feel for you, not having parents.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.300
But you can't keep living like this.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.200
Who asked you?

19:22.600 --> 19:25.600
Society has rules, you know.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.100
It's important to...

19:31.900 --> 19:34.700
We don't wag our tails for anyone!

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Bye-bye.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.200
Tough kids, huh?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.300
Stray cats.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.100
Here... we... go!

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
Ouch.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.800
This isn't your private sauna, White.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.300
White, come here, boy.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.300
You're almost 11, right?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.300
Yep.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.400
And still acting like a 3-year-old.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.500
Thanks, Gramps.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.200
He won't even listen to me anymore.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.700
That won't do, boy.
You've got to mind what Black says.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.500
The Rat's back.

20:23.800 --> 20:28.100
Listen to me. L can count to 10.
Listen. One, two...

20:28.300 --> 20:31.000
His guy Kimura is...

20:31.200 --> 20:34.400
...having his way with my town.

20:36.300 --> 20:39.700
<i>Watch what you say</i>
<i>with the "my town" talk.</i>

20:40.000 --> 20:41.900
<i>It's a bad habit.</i>

20:44.200 --> 20:45.300
Ten!

20:45.700 --> 20:49.100
<i>This isn't anybody's town.</i>

20:57.000 --> 20:59.900
You're behind schedule, Suzuki.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.200
L just got here. You don't want rivalries
flaring up again.

21:03.400 --> 21:07.700
Let me worry about the neighbors.

21:07.900 --> 21:12.900
"Foreigners" all over the place.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.500
And l'm putting them to good use!

21:15.800 --> 21:21.500
This project is co-financed
by a "foreigner."

21:22.400 --> 21:25.000
Stick to what you know.

21:26.100 --> 21:30.300
One thing l know is that development
doesn't suit Treasure Town.

21:30.500 --> 21:35.300
And that's why my parking spot
says "boss" and yours doesn't.

21:35.900 --> 21:40.400
All l asked you to do was
some waste management downtown.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.700
Run people out.

21:42.600 --> 21:49.200
And stop your damn squeaking.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.800
Nothing like an apple after a bath.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.500
Lift your leg.

21:58.700 --> 22:01.500
<i>Apple man, apple man</i>
<i>Apple man</i>

22:01.700 --> 22:05.100
When you gonna learn to
dress yourself?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.100
White's a marvel.

22:08.700 --> 22:13.900
Completely unscathed
by this armpit of a city.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.000
A real special child.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.600
Probably got all the answers.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.000
Just taking a while to blossom.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.600
Wow! A seed.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.300
No one so uncorrupted belongs here.

22:30.500 --> 22:34.900
Probably would have died
without you, Black.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.500
Be happy be happy!

22:52.200 --> 22:55.900
Don't worry. L'll protect, White.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.900
And our town too.

22:58.100 --> 23:02.200
Impossible. This town's days
are numbered.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.000
At my age you can sense these things.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.700
White knows it too.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.200
That's his gift.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.800
L just gots a great idea!

23:17.200 --> 23:20.300
A seed grows up to be a tree, right?

23:21.100 --> 23:25.800
And fruits grows on trees, right?
We can go plant it right now!

23:29.300 --> 23:34.100
Japan, Planet Earth,
Agent White here, do you read me?

23:35.600 --> 23:40.600
Today, l kept the peace in this town.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.400
And l'm going to have lots of apples!

23:44.600 --> 23:49.200
L even took a bath. Over and out!

23:56.200 --> 24:01.300
L got you Choco's info,
like you asked.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.000
Nice work. Thanks.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.700
So, Mr. Kimura...

24:09.900 --> 24:14.200
You said you wanted to join
our crew, right, Vanilla?

24:14.600 --> 24:15.800
Yes.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.500
Then lend me your ears.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.600
Y-yes?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Find him?

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
Nope.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.200
Where's Vanilla gone?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.600
Lately, he's...

24:38.400 --> 24:42.100
So, Choco. Looking for something?

24:43.600 --> 24:46.400
My office tonight. Be there. Alone!

24:46.600 --> 24:48.200
Shit!

24:48.400 --> 24:50.500
That guy's serious.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.000
What's in the box?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.700
What the...?

24:54.800 --> 24:57.400
<i>This town's days are numbered.</i>

24:58.100 --> 25:01.800
<i>White knows it too.</i>

25:05.900 --> 25:07.200
What's wrong?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.900
Ears?

25:15.400 --> 25:18.400
Vanilla's. They could tell
from the earrings.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.300
The gangster did it? Didn't he?

25:23.700 --> 25:25.000
Hope Choco's okay.

25:25.200 --> 25:29.400
No way. Choco's way out of
his league with Kimura.

25:29.900 --> 25:33.900
Choco's a fool. Never liked him.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.400
Don't say that.

25:36.800 --> 25:41.000
Talking bad about people
makes your heart dry up.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.100
It's true.

25:44.100 --> 25:48.900
Anyway, it's none
of our business. Right, Black?

25:49.600 --> 25:56.000
Be happy be happy.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.100
White, you asleep?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.200
Here.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.300
Keep it!

26:45.500 --> 26:48.400
Takeshi. So incorruptible.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
How'd you know my real name?

26:51.400 --> 26:57.000
From your dear mother.
She's staying at our hotel.

26:57.200 --> 27:01.000
Kimura you got some nerve
threatening my mother.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.800
Show some respect, boy!

27:05.500 --> 27:08.200
All choked up about her son...

27:08.400 --> 27:11.600
...the poor lost runaway.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.400
Breaks my heart, it really does.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.300
She misses you terribly.

27:20.500 --> 27:26.200
So upset she might take a dive off
the hotel roof.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.900
You dirty bastard!

27:30.100 --> 27:31.400
Not dirty...

27:31.800 --> 27:35.000
...just... a real yakuza, boy!

27:41.900 --> 27:45.800
And l don't play fair.

27:46.300 --> 27:49.900
This is my town!

28:11.700 --> 28:13.200
White? Ls that you?

28:14.300 --> 28:16.700
What's going on? Where's Black?

28:16.900 --> 28:18.500
He went bye-bye.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.300
Black went to fight the bad guys.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.000
Hey! Look out!
What's he doing out there?!

28:25.200 --> 28:27.600
What's that brat thinking?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.400
Brat?

28:34.500 --> 28:36.400
L'll wipe that grin off his face.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.100
No, Yasuda, don't!

28:38.300 --> 28:39.900
Don't worry. L won't hurt him.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.800
Black, get out of here, man.
This isn't your problem!

28:51.000 --> 28:52.700
L'm fine. Look.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.200
What makes you think
l'm here to help you?

28:57.500 --> 29:00.100
You got some nerve
coming here, Black.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.500
Leave him alone.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.000
This is my town.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.000
"Your town"? You're some comedian!

29:08.200 --> 29:09.200
Shut up!

29:21.800 --> 29:25.000
Stop it. He's just a kid.

29:26.300 --> 29:30.900
Spare the rod, spoil the child.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.100
He's just kidding, Kimura.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.000
Stupid yakuza.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.200
You're mine now.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.100
This the good stuff?

29:41.300 --> 29:42.300
You're dead!

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
When we hurts people,
l tell God we're sorry.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.000
L tell God...

29:59.500 --> 30:01.500
...we're sorry. Never do it again.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.600
Sorry. Sorry. Never do it again.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.000
<i>This is my town.</i>

30:38.000 --> 30:41.800
Unbelievable. All you had to
do was scare some kids.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.600
Some timing!

30:45.500 --> 30:50.900
Right before introducing
our new partner.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.000
You listenin', boy?

30:54.200 --> 30:59.500
He was a... kung fu master.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.600
No one asked you, idiot!

31:09.400 --> 31:12.000
No laughing! Next.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.300
White.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.700
Black. Hello.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.400
L've been looking all over for you.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.700
Slept with Gramps in the park.

31:27.900 --> 31:31.000
He said l was right.

31:31.200 --> 31:35.200
God's mad at us.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.200
Hey, White, what about
your apple seed?

31:39.600 --> 31:44.000
The one you planted.
We should go check it out.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.600
Yes! Maybe it has apples.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.100
Nothing?

31:56.400 --> 31:59.800
Why is there no apple tree yet?

32:00.500 --> 32:03.600
Lt'll grow when you least expect it.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.200
Hey, Black...

32:11.000 --> 32:13.300
...why are you always
hiding things from me?

32:13.700 --> 32:16.200
Lt makes me sad.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.400
If l tell you, you might get hurt.
There are some things...

32:20.600 --> 32:22.500
...you shouldn't get mixed up in.

32:22.900 --> 32:26.800
There you go again. Mr. Cool.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.300
"Too dangerous."
"Some things you shouldn't know."

32:29.500 --> 32:31.500
Like you know
what's good for everybody!

32:32.800 --> 32:33.700
Hey!

32:33.900 --> 32:36.400
L ain't afraid of no gangsters!

32:37.400 --> 32:40.500
We've come this far together, right?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.700
L got the most powerful kick
in the universe!

32:59.300 --> 33:01.200
Black's work, eh?

33:01.500 --> 33:04.500
Black always hated adults.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.800
Stroke him the wrong way and
he'll bite back.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Sorry.

33:08.300 --> 33:13.200
L told you, Treasure Town's
different from the others.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
L'm sorry.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.200
Apologies are for convicts
looking for parole.

33:18.500 --> 33:23.100
Take some time off.
Leave business to Ota.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.000
What? Why?

33:25.800 --> 33:30.500
You're a Scorpio, right?

33:30.700 --> 33:32.800
L'm a human.

33:33.200 --> 33:38.100
Your zodiac.
You're in a slump right now.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.100
Who cares about that?

33:41.900 --> 33:44.600
Clear your head for a while.

33:44.800 --> 33:45.800
Mr. Suzuki?

33:46.000 --> 33:49.300
Consider it a paid vacation.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.300
Mr. Suzuki...

33:59.700 --> 34:01.900
Here. Take this.

34:03.100 --> 34:08.400
We was gonna ride a airplane.
But you can have it.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.400
You keep it. Take care of it.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.000
Assassins?

34:16.300 --> 34:20.699
Three big guys. Aliens.
They ran us out of town.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.699
Are they tough?

34:24.100 --> 34:30.199
Killing machines.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.900
Only the Minotaur is stronger.

34:33.100 --> 34:35.600
That's a good one. The Minotaur.

34:35.900 --> 34:40.699
You don't believe in the Minotaur?
The crazy kid only believes in violence.

34:40.900 --> 34:41.900
L heard of him.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.100
Got a head like a cow.
Total bullshit.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.900
L don't believe in him but...

34:50.400 --> 34:54.300
...when l look at you l think...

34:58.300 --> 34:59.900
Forget him.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.800
You mean Black?

35:03.000 --> 35:07.400
He's just looking for trouble.

35:07.600 --> 35:12.400
You're comin' with us, White.
You aren't like him.

35:12.900 --> 35:13.900
Right?

35:16.300 --> 35:18.600
L'm all right.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.200
Bye-bye.

35:24.100 --> 35:25.700
White.

35:32.400 --> 35:37.700
L guess this town was just
too much for me.

36:15.300 --> 36:16.800
Would you stop with those?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.700
L'm so touched
you're concerned about my health.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.700
Your hair reeks of nicotine.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.200
L'm late.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.800
L'm usually like clockwork.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.600
Is it... mine?

36:38.900 --> 36:40.800
You're so predictable, sweetheart.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.700
<i>Free the darkness.</i>

37:01.600 --> 37:04.700
Concrete's got a special smell.

37:04.900 --> 37:08.700
Summer, winter, morning, night,
all got their own smell.

37:08.900 --> 37:13.000
But l like it when it rains.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.200
Smells like margarine.

37:20.300 --> 37:24.200
L got a bad feeling in my heart.
Something... no good.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.900
White.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.400
Be happy.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.600
Be happy!

37:40.600 --> 37:44.900
"Take some time off."
L'm a yakuza.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.800
We don't take time off.
What's happening to me?

37:50.100 --> 37:52.800
What a disgrace.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.900
Such a sad sight.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.000
Find the exit, freak!

38:02.200 --> 38:04.400
But then l wouldn't get
the chance to save you.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.100
You're preaching to the choir, idiot.

38:09.300 --> 38:12.500
Don't threaten me, friend.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.500
My rage is just as twisted
as my face.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.400
Such a waste of talent.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.600
Who the hell hired you?

38:24.300 --> 38:28.500
Let's just say l have friends
in high places.

38:29.300 --> 38:32.100
Contact me if you'd like to
explore your options.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.300
Come back!
Who are you?!

38:33.500 --> 38:36.600
Until we meet again, friend.

38:36.800 --> 38:43.200
Hey! L asked you a question.
Cretin! Loser!

38:55.000 --> 38:58.100
<i>It's gratifying to see you all here...</i>

38:58.400 --> 39:04.100
<i>... instead of busting each other's teeth</i>
<i>on the pavement.</i>

39:04.300 --> 39:06.700
<i>Now is a time for new approaches.</i>

39:06.900 --> 39:11.000
<i>So, what does the world need most?</i>

39:11.200 --> 39:13.700
<i>The economy is stagnant.</i>

39:13.900 --> 39:18.300
<i>We've become white elephants.</i>

39:18.500 --> 39:24.800
We need new business,
new stimulation. Entertainment!

39:25.800 --> 39:28.300
This is the wave of the future!

39:28.500 --> 39:31.600
And what better place to start...

39:31.800 --> 39:35.500
...than with the piggy banks of kids
and the wallets of their parents!

39:36.100 --> 39:40.000
Working with Mr. Snake has taught me
a great deal, such a man of vision!

39:40.600 --> 39:43.100
A culture shock of sorts.

39:44.400 --> 39:50.300
But of the many gains we achieve
the greatest is that...

39:51.400 --> 39:53.300
...we face our future.

39:53.500 --> 39:58.600
Develop or perish, gentlemen!
And so, to continue...

39:58.800 --> 40:01.000
...Professor Snake, if you would.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.200
Let's cut to the chase.

40:05.700 --> 40:09.300
The third district that you control,
the so-called Treasure Town district...

40:09.500 --> 40:12.500
...is... well, quaint at best.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.100
<i>Unspoiled land, surrounded by</i>
<i>the biggest growth areas in the city.</i>

40:18.300 --> 40:21.100
That's where we come in.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.700
<i>As you can see, since launching...</i>

40:24.900 --> 40:28.700
<i>... the first Kiddie Kastle project</i>
<i>three years ago...</i>

40:28.900 --> 40:31.700
<i>... we've had nothing but</i>
<i>unencumbered profit margins.</i>

40:31.900 --> 40:37.900
You truly have the Midas touch,
Monsieur Snake.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.000
And we thank you!

40:41.200 --> 40:46.600
A new revenue source!
More wallets to pick clean!

40:46.800 --> 40:48.600
So, gentlemen...

40:48.800 --> 40:49.900
Boss.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.800
What now, Rat?

40:52.000 --> 40:55.800
Genpachi's strip joint is in the third.

40:57.300 --> 41:03.300
<i>For 50 years, boys in this town</i>
<i>have been made men there.</i>

41:04.200 --> 41:09.100
Why tear it down and replace it
with a kid's playground?

41:09.300 --> 41:12.200
Ever the nostalgiste, eh Rat?

41:12.500 --> 41:17.400
<i>They got more strippers</i>
<i>than customers these days.</i>

41:17.900 --> 41:21.600
We can't forget the people
who love and...

41:21.800 --> 41:24.200
...were raised in Treasure Town.

41:24.400 --> 41:30.600
Get with the program! Herr Snake is
our friend and our guest.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.600
We've got lots to learn from him.
And we will. Gentlemen?

41:34.800 --> 41:36.700
To...

41:37.100 --> 41:39.700
...new beginnings!

41:47.700 --> 41:53.100
<i>No time for tears.</i>
<i>No time for regrets.</i>

41:53.300 --> 41:57.900
<i>Think like that and the city'll kill you.</i>

42:00.800 --> 42:02.700
L can't see.

42:06.100 --> 42:09.300
Hello, this is Snake.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.500
So it's you, friend.

42:12.700 --> 42:18.100
L hoped you might change your mind.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.800
Of course, you're always welcome.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.900
Who was that?

42:27.400 --> 42:30.300
You've been moping for days.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.600
Why don't you get some fresh air?

42:38.400 --> 42:39.700
Yo.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.500
Mr. Suzuki!

42:43.200 --> 42:45.500
What're you doing here?

42:45.700 --> 42:48.000
Came to check on you.

42:48.200 --> 42:50.000
Where's Ota and Adachi?

42:50.400 --> 42:52.200
Left 'em behind.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.400
They cramp my style.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.800
Something happen?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.100
Same old thing.

43:00.600 --> 43:03.800
They're gonna turn Treasure Town
into an amusement park.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.800
Oh, a light...

43:08.200 --> 43:11.000
You quit, huh?

43:11.300 --> 43:13.900
My girl's pregnant.

43:14.300 --> 43:17.500
Come spring l'll be a dad.

43:17.700 --> 43:22.300
Congrats, it'll suit you.
You been okay?

43:22.500 --> 43:26.300
L wouldn't say okay. Feels like being
under house arrest.

43:26.500 --> 43:31.200
Patience is a virtue, Kimura.

43:31.400 --> 43:37.200
You think, "Can't teach an old
dog new tricks" applies to me?

43:38.100 --> 43:40.700
L dunno know.

43:40.900 --> 43:45.700
Sometimes... I wonder.

43:48.100 --> 43:51.100
Shiny, shiny shoe.

43:51.300 --> 43:56.800
Makes me sad
'cause there's only one.

43:57.100 --> 44:00.100
Ah! Found the other one!

44:17.600 --> 44:20.100
Three strange-looking guys. Big ones.

44:20.300 --> 44:24.000
Real scary. Curly eyebrows.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.500
Curly eyebrows?

44:25.700 --> 44:29.300
They were huge!

44:30.100 --> 44:34.400
"The three assassins
will come here too."

44:35.400 --> 44:38.400
"Killing machines."

44:39.200 --> 44:41.100
Right.

44:41.800 --> 44:44.900
They do have curly eyebrows.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.900
Who's that?

44:48.900 --> 44:51.100
What's he doing with them?

44:51.900 --> 44:55.700
They're really... big.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.500
Some kind of modern art?

44:59.900 --> 45:01.900
You amuse me, friend.

45:02.700 --> 45:07.700
We cooperate in pursuit of one goal.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.600
They're the muscle. L'm the brains.

45:11.800 --> 45:16.500
We work together to create
a perfect piece of art.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.600
Never met a tall guy worth a shit.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.300
Shall l show you their true strength?

45:25.500 --> 45:27.700
$%&=):@ $%&=):@ =):$.

45:27.900 --> 45:29.600
What language was that?

45:30.200 --> 45:33.600
What's happening?
Where are they headed?

45:34.100 --> 45:36.200
Cat extermination.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.800
Cats? That's not your concern!

45:40.800 --> 45:42.500
Black.

45:43.900 --> 45:48.400
L gots... a bad feeling.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.100
Let's go, buddy.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.900
Hey!

46:10.900 --> 46:12.500
L don't know where you're from...

46:12.700 --> 46:15.000
...but let the people of this town deal
with the Cats.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.000
Keep out of it.

46:17.300 --> 46:20.300
L know about you and Black.

46:20.700 --> 46:25.200
But l'm not hunting them
to avenge you.

46:25.400 --> 46:28.700
This town's just got
a certain <i>je ne sais quoi,</i> right?

46:28.900 --> 46:30.300
Get away from me!

46:30.800 --> 46:32.500
L'm going to change this city.

46:32.700 --> 46:35.800
And it makes no
difference to me if you're in or out.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.500
L'm only talking about those kids!

46:38.700 --> 46:42.000
Alliances with cops, yakuza...

46:42.300 --> 46:47.500
...are important, but those alone
won't change this town.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.600
My town must be transformed.

46:53.800 --> 46:57.000
Your town?

46:59.700 --> 47:04.700
<i>Few are chosen to pursue the ideal.</i>

47:04.900 --> 47:08.700
<i>What are you after?</i>

47:08.900 --> 47:12.600
<i>We serve the ultimate authority.</i>

47:13.600 --> 47:17.100
<i>Do you know who that is, friend?</i>

47:17.800 --> 47:19.100
He looks tough.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.900
<i>God.</i>

47:46.500 --> 47:50.000
<i>People say l'm small but...</i>

47:50.200 --> 47:52.400
<i>... l'm a giant to that ant.</i>

47:53.100 --> 47:57.600
<i>To ants, l am a giant! A giant!</i>

48:19.200 --> 48:20.500
Get up, Black!

48:20.700 --> 48:22.200
Hurry.

48:46.900 --> 48:50.400
A rat, taking a trip
down memory lane.

48:52.900 --> 48:54.500
Alone, Rat?

48:55.100 --> 48:57.500
No entourage today?

48:59.100 --> 49:01.500
They cramp my style.

49:01.800 --> 49:05.200
Planning suicide? Then get to it.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.500
But don't expect me to clean up.

49:10.500 --> 49:12.800
Hey! Where you going now?

49:13.900 --> 49:17.800
Rat! Lt's not safe
for you around here. Hey!

49:21.100 --> 49:24.900
Shit! Lt hurts bad.

49:25.100 --> 49:29.600
You hurts? You're bleedin'
like crazy.

49:30.300 --> 49:32.600
Black, l've been thinking...

49:33.300 --> 49:35.600
...I thinks he's an alien.

49:35.900 --> 49:39.300
Well, he's not gonna mess
with my town.

50:01.800 --> 50:02.800
White.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.100
Stand up, White.

50:09.100 --> 50:11.600
C'mon, man!

50:16.100 --> 50:17.100
No way.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.800
What the hell is that thing?!

50:39.000 --> 50:42.800
Not your cup of tea, Fujimura?

50:43.700 --> 50:49.100
What about you, Rookie?
You learning something?

50:49.300 --> 50:51.800
Ah, no matter, l'm frigid.

50:52.000 --> 50:53.800
Sign of the times maybe.

50:55.100 --> 50:58.800
Who cares. This'll be
a kid's playground soon.

50:59.300 --> 51:04.800
Fruits of your labor, eh, Rat?

51:06.900 --> 51:10.700
Each to his own
and every man for himself.

51:13.300 --> 51:18.300
This town could care less about us.
And it'll keep changing.

51:19.700 --> 51:23.300
L learned all l know on these streets.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.300
<i>Booze, cigarettes...</i>

51:26.900 --> 51:31.700
...gambling, women, the easy life.

51:31.900 --> 51:35.100
L loved this town.

51:38.300 --> 51:41.500
<i>We follow His designs.</i>

51:41.800 --> 51:44.500
<i>L obey only Him.</i>

51:45.400 --> 51:46.500
L hate it.

51:46.700 --> 51:48.600
<i>May the Lord be with us.</i>

51:51.400 --> 51:53.900
Too heavy.

51:54.100 --> 51:56.100
- L hate it.
- Huh? What?

51:58.100 --> 52:00.000
L hate this town.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.800
Snap out of it, White!

52:04.000 --> 52:05.600
L hate it.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.000
Don't flake out on me.

52:10.800 --> 52:13.200
L hate this town, Black.

52:15.100 --> 52:19.900
I... just thought of something
real smart!

52:20.200 --> 52:22.400
Come on, White, come on!

52:22.700 --> 52:26.800
Let's build a house. By the sea.
Just the two of us.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.800
Are you for real!?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.500
Back off!

52:31.700 --> 52:34.100
And, and, we can paint it blue.

52:34.300 --> 52:36.400
% & ($ <i>NO%</i> & &$ .

52:36.700 --> 52:40.300
He makes less sense than you.

52:53.500 --> 52:54.400
Black.

53:16.500 --> 53:19.200
Okay, okay, everything's okay.

53:19.700 --> 53:23.200
Totally out of control.

53:24.800 --> 53:27.500
Wonder if White's okay.

53:52.100 --> 53:55.100
Agent White, Planet Earth here.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.600
L have come to defeat the alien.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.000
Gas?

54:05.000 --> 54:08.200
Agent White had a dream.

54:11.300 --> 54:12.700
Of the sea...

54:13.900 --> 54:14.900
...the sky...

54:16.300 --> 54:17.300
...the trees...

54:21.700 --> 54:23.500
...and the wind.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.500
My dream.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.800
Let it burn... all of it.

55:00.900 --> 55:02.000
White.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.500
Let it all burn.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.700
This whole city's going to burn.

55:16.700 --> 55:19.700
If things were just spinning...

55:19.900 --> 55:24.900
...spinning a little bit slower,
White could be happy...

55:25.100 --> 55:27.400
White! Look at me!

55:28.000 --> 55:29.800
You okay? Listen!

55:30.300 --> 55:34.800
We're being hunted.
Can you hear me?

55:35.000 --> 55:37.100
We can't go back home.

55:37.400 --> 55:40.600
L need my hats.
My hats and my watches.

55:40.800 --> 55:44.200
My treasures.

55:44.800 --> 55:48.000
Hello? This is Earth,
Agent White speaking.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.800
L'll go get 'em. But stay here, okay?

55:51.200 --> 55:53.300
Hello. This is Earth, Agent White.

55:53.500 --> 55:54.600
White!

55:56.700 --> 55:58.500
Roger.

56:03.800 --> 56:07.500
Hello? Hello?

56:08.200 --> 56:11.000
Do you read me, over?

56:20.700 --> 56:22.600
Keep your eyes on the road.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.300
Can't believe it's almost Winter.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.700
When it snows, even this filthy town...

56:28.900 --> 56:31.600
...looks sort of pure.

56:32.600 --> 56:35.800
L like it when you get sentimental.

57:07.300 --> 57:08.800
My apple tree!

57:09.700 --> 57:15.000
Gotta water it.
Agent White is a very smart boy!

57:49.300 --> 57:52.800
White! Brought your stuff.

57:58.800 --> 58:01.700
L told him to stay put!

58:25.100 --> 58:26.300
Oh, no!

58:26.600 --> 58:30.000
Personally l like Spring the best.

58:33.300 --> 58:35.200
Cherry blossoms...

58:36.500 --> 58:38.000
Sawada, stop!

58:38.700 --> 58:39.600
Stop the car!

58:39.800 --> 58:40.900
Yes, boss.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.400
Follow me.

58:44.600 --> 58:46.400
- Fujimura?
- Come on!

59:44.000 --> 59:46.600
White hates Winter.

59:48.500 --> 59:50.200
Makes him cry.

59:51.100 --> 59:52.900
Reminds him of that story.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.200
The ant and the grasshopper...

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.500
...he hates it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.900
He says the grasshopper
didn't do anything wrong.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.600
That makes him cry.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.300
White cries.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.500
Stop! Stop right there!!

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.900
K&

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.200
lt... flies?

01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.100
White?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.000
L gotta get home. Get home to Black.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.700
It stopped, the rain.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.600
White, where were you?

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.600
Wanted to check on my tree.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.400
My... apple...

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.400
Apple... tree.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.400
It's... not growing.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.000
Blood... so red...

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.900
Flying fish?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.100
Hey, Black, am l going to die?

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.000
People don't die so easy.

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:22.700
White.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.400
It's a miracle the kid's alive.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.000
Lost a lot of blood.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.000
Any later and we wouldn't be
sitting here.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.000
Thanks for the help.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.900
Have you seen Black?

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.400
He's sticking to White like glue.
L told him it won't help.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.400
But he won't move a muscle.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.000
Just sitting there.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.300
Like he's in shock.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.600
He isn't.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:16.000
Black is calm.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.600
He's already lost faith in the living.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.900
His only purpose in life
has been to protect White.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.800
Without White, he'd have no reason
to live.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.400
So he's not in shock.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.300
This place...

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:23.100
l know this place.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.800
Welcome back, White.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.100
L'm back.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.000
L'm so tired, Gramps.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.800
That took a lot out of me.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:12.300
White's... different.
All he does is talk silly talk.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.300
L don't know if l can protect him
anymore.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
L told you before...

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.000
...you can't protect that boy.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.900
Better get to it or
Black will be back.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.700
Okay, okay.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.900
L don't believe in God
or anything...

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.400
But it seems like God is trying
to take White away from me.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.400
That boy's stronger than you think.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.800
And you're not as tough as you think.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.000
My eyes tell me...

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.200
...he's been the one protecting you.
Am l wrong?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.900
L believe in you, Black.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.300
Even if God looks the other way.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Noooooo!

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.400
We're taking the boy
into police custody.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.600
Emergency measures.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.000
Stop! His stitches will come apart!

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.800
Black.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.000
He's not moving.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.800
He won't make any trouble.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.100
It's for his own good.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:43.800
You know how dangerous life is
for him in this town.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.700
Right, Black?

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.500
White's just holding me back.
Take him away.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.100
What? Holding you back?!

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.400
You're jokin'. It's me, White.
You liar!

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.600
L had a dream. It was blue, so blue.
And you were there with me, Black!

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.000
L can't take you
and your silly dreams!

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.600
L'll find a stronger partner.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.300
Stop! Black, you...

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:17.100
New partner? You think anyone else
would be with you!

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.600
Say something! Black!

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.200
Hey, White.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.899
Yo, Sawada.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.600
Drawing a fish today, eh?

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.600
A dolphin.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.899
What's that coming out of his eye?

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.600
A jet beam.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.700
Shoots it outta his eyes.
Pretty cool, huh?

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:48.700
Pretty weird.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.100
Keep the room clean, will you?

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.200
Yo, Fujimura.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.200
Had to pull strings to get it.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.100
Sawada, out here.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.500
Yeah?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:13.000
Fujimura, look! This dolphin's got
magic power coming out his eyes!

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.000
Transform!!

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.700
They found another gangster
knocked out in front of Kiddie Kastle.

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.899
Eighth one this month.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.700
Black again, eh?

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:36.700
Construction is proceeding nicely but
that brat continues to be a nuisance.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.300
Black?

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.200
People say he's changed.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.399
<i>Unbalanced since losing White.</i>

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:49.399
<i>Out for blood.</i>

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.899
Such insight!

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.300
That's what Suzuki said anyways.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.800
Ah, Suzuki.

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:03.400
Him turning on the boss is hurting us.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.800
Seems he has friends
on the police force.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.100
So much for your grand vision.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:17.000
You sound like a spectator.
L thought you came to play ball.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.200
Time you got off the bench.

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:25.700
Nice day, Sawada!

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.200
Can't you even tie your shoes?

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.400
Black did everything for me.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.100
Hey, White?

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.800
Why don't you ever ask about Black?

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.700
Aren't you worried about him?

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.700
White is missing lots of screws.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.600
Screws?

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.800
Screws for my heart.
He made me broken. God did.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.900
Broken?

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.600
And him too, Black too.

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.300
He's missing screws too,
screws for his heart.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.300
Black's broken too?

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.800
Yep. But l gots all the screws
Black needs.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.400
L got every one!

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.200
L heard Black got Ota's brother.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.800
Black... who's he?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
He's number one around here.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.500
Isn't the Minotaur the toughest?

01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.200
No, Black's tougher.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.600
Split up with White. Going crazy now.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.600
What if Black is the Minotaur?

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.300
What if Black's the one who
sold White out to the cops?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.300
The word on the street...

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.100
...is that you're possessed.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.000
The more you love something,
the deeper the pain.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:48.000
Treasure Town will never be
what it was, Black.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:55.600
Even if we stop,
the city keeps going.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.100
You're gonna die.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.900
It's written on your face.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.400
Then l'll see you in hell.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.900
L'll be waiting there for you.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.000
This town is hell.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.500
This is hell.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.300
Smith & Wesson 6906.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.200
Untraceable.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.900
Use it to put Suzuki out of his misery.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.900
What! Me kill Suzuki?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.600
Nothing fancy.
Just aim for the head.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.200
All you have to do
is squeeze the trigger.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.200
You're kidding?

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400
Never.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.500
He saved me.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.900
He taught me everything l know.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.900
So touching, especially with you
becoming a daddy.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.600
Just imagine your lady with
her stomach ripped open.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.800
You son of a bitch!

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.400
What l am, Kimura... is a pro.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.600
And don't you ever forget it.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:29.000
Once the kid's born
we should leave town.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.700
L thought you quit.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.800
Let me help you.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.700
We'll leave...

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.800
...and go far away.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.200
Gonna stretch my legs.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.500
L'll go.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:03.700
Don't worry.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.700
It's not safe, boss.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.400
Mercury is rising.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.300
My luck is good right now.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.400
Let an old man walk alone
under the stars.

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.800
You alone?

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.800
What did you want to talk about?

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.700
My girlfriend and I, we're
thinking of settling down.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.800
Don't be so coy, Kimura!

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:52.800
L wanted to ask
if you'd be my best man.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.200
Well, l don't know if l fit the part, but...

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.800
...sure. Congratulations.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.800
A toast.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.500
To new beginnings!

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.600
So? When is it?

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.500
You know, the due date.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.600
Beginning of April.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.700
Excellent, Kimura!

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200
A Saturn.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.100
Very compassionate.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:48.500
Got to take care of yourself
with a kid.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.700
Especially in this racket.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.300
L lost my parents early.

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:05.500
No one to take me to ball games...

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.600
...teach me to fish.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.600
You knew.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.700
Since the day l was born.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.100
Birth signals the arrival of death.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.600
You could always
read me like a book.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.100
You're easy to read.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.600
L like that about you.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.800
Anyway, it's a good day to die.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:49.900
L'm not wearing a vest, so anywhere
but the face please.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.100
L've come to like this mug.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:58.400
You've been like a father to me.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.500
"The sins of the fathers..."

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.600
l joined the gang because of you.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.600
For me, you were...

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.000
My final tip, be quiet
when you whack someone.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.200
L taught you better than that, yes?

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.000
Yes, sir.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.300
Don't leave prints
when you ditch the piece.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.800
Yes, sir.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.200
And burn your clothes.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.000
Yes, sir.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.400
Most important,
love your wife and child.

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.300
Yes.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.300
Because all you need is love.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:10.200
<i>Black. This is where we all end up.</i>

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.500
<i>You can't choose the life.</i>

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:18.400
<i>It chooses you.</i>

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.400
Hustle your ass, Rat.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.800
<i>This is my town.</i>

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.400
Naoki Kimura, at your service sir.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.800
We're going to change this town.
Do me proud, Rat.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.500
Yes, sir!

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:54.500
Had enough, eh, Rat?

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.600
Well done, friend. L didn't think you
had it in you.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.700
W&% $ (=~%? &% $?

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.200
These two could learn from you.
Pathetic.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.600
He's just a kid.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.400
"Just a kid"?

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.400
Ls that what you said
when he did that?

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.800
! $ $ %) ((&$ .

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.900
They're going to kill him?

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.700
Just emptying the trash.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.700
This is my town. L need to keep
my streets clean.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.300
Wait.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:51.700
Again? This makes the third time.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.500
Please, a once-in-a-lifetime request.

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.800
Three once-in-a-lifetime requests?

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.800
Leave me with enough for a drink!

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.300
Today's loot.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.400
It's yours.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.300
L don't want your blood money.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.200
The Rat's dead.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:29.200
L know. When you live the life l do,
you hear these things.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.700
Have you seen White?

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.800
L told him to stay put.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.200
What're you going on about?
White's with the police.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.700
L told you, Black.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:46.900
L told him to stay put. Damn.

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:54.300
Poor kid.
Needs a shrink.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:58.500
L doubt a doctor could understand
his pain.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:03.500
Nobody can understand his pain.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.900
What's going on, White?

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.400
Sawada...

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.500
...when the sky turns black,
why do l feel so blue?

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:27.100
Guess it makes me think
about dying.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.700
White.

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.900
It's not growing at all.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.100
Why isn't it growing?

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.900
L water it every day.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:56.400
Why, White?

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:09.000
Hello, hello. Agent White,
do you read me, over?

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.000
You okay, White?

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.200
Be happy be happy.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.600
It's all going to be okay.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.000
It's all going to be okay
because White came back to me.

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:37.100
L have to tell everyone
White came back to me.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200
Is this a cow?

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:51.700
Minotaur.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.200
Minotaur?

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.000
He's going to eat up this town.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.000
L gots a bad feeling.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.700
He's back.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.100
My partner came back.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.300
White's his name.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.900
Look.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.100
Hey!

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.500
He hates Winter.

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:27.500
Stay away, brat.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.600
He's got a lot of watches.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.400
Mommy, look, over here!

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.900
Black... White... Black... White...

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.600
Hey, settle down now.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.100
You're scaring me. Stop it.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.600
What's happening?

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.200
White! White!

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.500
Hey, you! You snuck in, didn't you?

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.100
Where are your parents?

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.100
White's back!

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.200
He can only count to ten!

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.200
Don't push!

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
He's got a gun!

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.500
You guys got all dressed up tonight.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.500
L'm so happy you came.
Everything's okay now.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.300
My buddy came home.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.000
L'll introduce you.

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.000
His name's White.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.100
White...

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.500
K& &I (&% <i>!</i>

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Can you hear me? Get a grip.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.200
What's wrong?

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.600
Where does it hurt?

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.000
This place...

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:47.300
Okay, yeah, all right.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.500
L know...

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.700
Know this place.

01:28:57.700 --> 01:28:59.200
L know this place.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.000
Don't fear the darkness, Black.

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.800
Behold... the true power...

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.600
...of the darkness.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.600
Holy Shit.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.000
Damn.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.400
Faulty parts. Totally replaceable.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600
Replaceable?

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.500
L call the office and order
spares.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.000
A part wears out and you replace it.
That's business.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800
Faulty parts.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.700
Kimura, gimme a light!

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.200
Light this!

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:50.300
Kimura, who put you up to this?

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.200
Love. Love and truth.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:24.000
Don't be scared. Follow me.

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.600
L'll show you the way.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.600
L'm here with you, Black.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:51.100
L can't keep him down!

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.200
This is the landscape
of your creation.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:04.400
A deeper, higher dimension:

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:07.100
Darkness.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.900
Darkness?

01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.800
Don't fear it.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.600
It transcends all.

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:19.200
Transcends all?

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:22.300
The power of darkness.

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:31.400
White? Ls that you?

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.500
No, don't get clouded.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.700
Do... not... get... clouded.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.600
That leads to death.

01:32:41.700 --> 01:32:42.700
Is this a dream?

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:45.000
More real than reality.

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:48.200
Hold still!

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.000
Free the darkness in you.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.800
Hey, Sawada.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200
White?

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.500
Show him your true power.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.500
My... true power?

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.800
Let go.

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.400
Darkness is truth.

01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.700
Whoa!

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:11.500
White! Hey! White!

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.100
Come on, Black!

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.100
Who are you?

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.400
Lost between light and dark...

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:26.400
...you found another part of yourself.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.600
That wound.

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:30.900
Let's do it!

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.200
Now we can really bathe
our town in blood!!

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:50.300
Let's live in a town by the ocean.

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.500
Where we can hear the waves.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.900
A hammock on the porch.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:01.700
L can play catch with the kids
on weekends.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:08.300
You're acting kind of weird today.
Scary.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.200
Makoto.

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.400
Name the baby that.

01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.200
Makoto... meaning "truth."

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.700
Never. L'd never have a boy.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.200
This is my power?

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.900
This is just the beginning.

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.600
You're capable of so much more.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.700
White.

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.000
Hey.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.000
Wait.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.000
You want to see him, right, White?

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.500
You want to see Black?

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:32.200
L gots all the screws Black needs!

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.500
L've got every one!

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:38.600
White again?!

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:40.100
Stop!

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.500
White?

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:44.600
Always getting in the way!

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.100
He's a hypocrite.

01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:50.300
A pretender.

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.600
L'm not just a shadow
cast by your light.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.100
L'm the real you.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.700
Darkness is pure,
transparent, beautiful.

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:20.400
Embrace solitude.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.400
<i>What do you see over there?</i>

01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:44.700
<i>What do you see over there?</i>

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.500
Everyone calls me White.

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:25.400
<i>Be happy be happy.</i>

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.600
<i>Be happy be happy.</i>

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.900
Not him.

01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.400
You need me!

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:41.800
What do your eyes tell you?

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.500
What do you truly believe in?

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.700
I... l...

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.200
l believe in... White.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.800
Look at the scar on your hand.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:18.800
It's there to remind you.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.400
L'm there, inside you.

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.800
Always. Whenever you need me.

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.900
You think the kid's
really going to show?

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:25.300
Have faith, Mr. Fujimura.

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.500
"Faith"? What's there to have faith in?

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.300
Lt's no good to doubt, Mr. Fujimura.

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:37.700
Troy doubted Cassandra
and then the Greeks won!

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
That's got absolutely nothing
to do with this.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.900
He's coming.

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.800
Where?

01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.300
Welcome back.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.100
Black.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:41.600
Be happy be happy.

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:45.800
Look.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.700
Hey, Black.

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:50.800
Catch!

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.900
This is Planet Earth, Agent White.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.200
Do you read me, over?

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.900
Today l kept the peace
on this planet.

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:34.100
Over?

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.300
This planet's very peaceful.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.900
Over and out.
