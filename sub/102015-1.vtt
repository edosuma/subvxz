00:09.593 --> 00:11.970
The records of Emily Dickinson's life,

00:12.054 --> 00:15.849
up to and including
Sue and Austin's marriage,

00:15.933 --> 00:19.186
are full and factual
compared with what lies ahead.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.858
Over the next few years,
just a handful of letters survive.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.657
The truth, perhaps,
is hidden in her poems.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.317
Mrs. Dickinson.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.891
Look straight ahead. Relax.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.978
Okay. Doctor, what do you think?

03:06.061 --> 03:07.855
-It doesn't look good.
-I'm not going blind, am I?

03:07.938 --> 03:10.858
-No, no. Not blind, no.
-Oh, thank God. That's a relief. Good.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.777
Do you still have the blurriness?
The odd flashes of light?

03:13.861 --> 03:18.031
Yes. Like sometimes when I'm writing,
the edges of the page just disappear.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.992
-Do you write often?
-All the time.

03:20.075 --> 03:23.078
Well, you might wanna stop
doing so much of that.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.496
Stop writing?

03:24.580 --> 03:26.415
Could all that writing
be hurting her eyes?

03:26.498 --> 03:27.708
Anything's possible.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.545
Oh, my God. Emily, dear, you don't want to
cause any increasing harm to your vision.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.380
Well, again, you're not going blind.

03:33.463 --> 03:37.301
-See?
-It appears she is suffering from iritis.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.554
It's an inflammation of the iris.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.431
Along with a touch of myopia.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.141
All right. So what's the treatment?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.018
Sit in dim rooms if you can.

03:46.101 --> 03:50.814
Avoid the sun. And remember,
you can't necessarily trust what you see.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.524
-Avoid the sun?
-Yes.

03:52.608 --> 03:53.483
That's it?

03:54.276 --> 03:55.777
Goddamn it, man.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.530
This was a lot of money to pay
for a bit of impossible advice.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.158
"Avoid the sun"?
She's not a bat, you know.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.827
Dad, it's okay. I don't need the sun.
I still have the moon.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.496
Emily, hush. Can't you see
I'm in the middle of shouting at this man?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.916
If you like,
you could stay a couple more days.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.418
-I could conduct further observation.
-I wanna go home.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.504
Let me just present you with the bill.

04:16.632 --> 04:17.632
You're a crook.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.551
I'm actually America's
very first ophthalmologist.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.928
This is outrageous!

04:21.011 --> 04:22.888
You'll have to come back
in about six months

04:22.971 --> 04:24.139
to see if there's been any improvement.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.475
-So you think it might get better?
-Oh, no.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.102
It will only get worse.

04:49.456 --> 04:53.335
Before I got my eye put out -
I liked as well to see

04:54.670 --> 04:57.965
as other creatures that have eyes -
and know no other way -

05:00.634 --> 05:03.428
But were it told to me, Today,

05:03.512 --> 05:05.347
That I might have the Sky

05:06.974 --> 05:10.561
For mine I tell you that my Heart
Would split for size of me -

05:11.728 --> 05:14.273
This is highway robbery, this man.
Unbelievable.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.941
Do you have to keep muttering?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.778
I'm just trying to figure out
how three days at the doctor's office

05:19.862 --> 05:22.030
cost us the equivalent
of a trip to Europe.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.950
Sorry for being so expensive.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.162
Oh, no, it's not you. No, honey,
I spend barely anything on you.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.417
It's your brother, unfortunately.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.836
I spent far too much on that house of his.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.796
Had to have the finest of everything.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.384
And then the market crashed,
and the railroad went bankrupt...

05:42.801 --> 05:44.636
Do you mind if I go back to thinking now?

05:46.513 --> 05:47.347
No.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.192
You really are a poet.
You write all the time these days.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.617
Well, what do you do with all these poems?
You never show them to me.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.078
Well, I could--
I couldn't show them to you.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.705
Why not?

06:12.831 --> 06:14.625
You wouldn't understand them.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.630
Well, you're probably right.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.134
I just hope that you do find
someone who can understand.

06:25.511 --> 06:29.306
Oh, don't worry. I have someone. I do.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.842
Long ride from New York.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.012
-Thanks for coming.
-Of course. Let me get this for you.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.181
Yes. Careful. Careful.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.350
You would not believe
how much I spent on this.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.726
I'm sure I wouldn't.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.436
Oh, God, I hope she likes it.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.188
There we go.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.691
Thanks again, Henry.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.528
-Mr. Dickinson, before you go--
-Actually, just call me Austin.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.697
Honestly, it feels less awkward.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.365
-Austin then.
-Yeah.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.367
-I was just wondering...
-Yes?

07:31.535 --> 07:33.745
...whether the barn might be free tonight?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.374
Oh. Yes, absolutely.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.750
Free as a bird.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.878
So, it's all right if I...

07:40.961 --> 07:42.588
You do your thing in there, Henry.

07:42.671 --> 07:46.341
And if anyone asks you any questions,
you send them right to me.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.553
-You're a kind man, Mr. Dickinson.
-Austin.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.138
Okay.

07:54.766 --> 07:57.603
Your father is being
so terribly frugal these days.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.897
He frets about every little expense now.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.733
You know,
he's even asked us to take in a boarder.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.235
-Excuse me?
-I was shocked too.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.237
I said, "What kind of respectable people
will we be

08:07.321 --> 08:09.114
if we have a stranger living with us?"

08:10.157 --> 08:12.492
Luckily, I managed to find
someone we already know.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.954
Do you remember that nice young man
who dropped out of Austin's college class?

08:16.038 --> 08:17.289
Mr. Shipley.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.043
-Wait, Mom, the one that I used to--
-Oh, and he's already arrived.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.211
Hello, boarder.

08:25.964 --> 08:26.965
How are you?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.593
What is even happening right now?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.358
Hello.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.529
Was I talking to myself?

08:51.323 --> 08:53.617
I think I know you from somewhere.
What is your name?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.120
I'm nobody!

08:58.664 --> 08:59.665
Who are you?

09:00.499 --> 09:03.126
I'm Emily Dickinson of Amherst.

09:05.712 --> 09:09.424
Really, I must have met you before.
You look so familiar. I--

09:20.060 --> 09:21.103
Thank you.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.359
I...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.405
Hey, who are you?

09:32.906 --> 09:36.535
The train doesn't even have a dining car.
No wonder the railroad went bust.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.079
Who were you talking to?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.459
Nobody.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.051
Cool dolls.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.474
What are you doing in my house?

09:59.558 --> 10:02.269
The last I heard, you were back
in Kentucky making bootleg whiskey.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.062
I was actually selling pharmaceuticals.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.940
It's just one of my many
successful business ventures.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.944
Okay. If it was so successful,
then what are you doing back in Amherst,

10:11.028 --> 10:13.363
paying rent for a room
in my parents' house?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.865
I'm glad you asked.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.576
I came here for you.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.497
-I'm surprised you even remember me.
-Of course I remember you.

10:22.581 --> 10:28.045
You're the most pure, simple, quiet,
traditional girl I ever knew.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.130
And that is why...

10:31.298 --> 10:32.758
I wanna make you my wife.

10:35.010 --> 10:35.844
Ship.

10:36.762 --> 10:37.846
Ship, we hooked up once,

10:37.930 --> 10:39.848
and then you hooked up
with someone else the same night.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.142
That wasn't very chivalrous of me.

10:42.226 --> 10:45.187
You'll see I've changed, Lavinia.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.774
I'm not that college dropout
who got drunk and tobogganed into a lake.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.528
I'm a serious adult man
with entrepreneurial instincts

10:52.611 --> 10:56.073
and a profound respect for women
who embody traditional values,

10:56.156 --> 10:59.493
such as submissiveness, chastity,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.787
and a willingness to do household chores.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.332
I'm not even like that.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.209
You're Lavinia Dickinson.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.337
You have tea parties for your cats.

11:10.420 --> 11:14.132
Okay. Well, yes, but I've changed too.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.302
And how have you changed?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.684
I'll show you.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.645
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

11:26.728 --> 11:29.356
Don't you think we should wait?
Until marriage?

11:31.817 --> 11:33.402
Henry "Ship" Shipley...

11:34.570 --> 11:36.989
I don't think you have any idea
who you're dealing with.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.258
Feels good to be home.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.721
-We're home!
-Hello?

12:00.804 --> 12:02.264
They're back from their journey.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.433
What did the doctor say?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.935
You have no idea
how hard this has been for me.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.604
Mother, I'm the one with the eye problem.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.564
Well, I'm the one with a daughter
who may be going blind.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.107
I'm not going blind.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.443
God, why is this happening to me?

12:14.526 --> 12:15.986
Again, not happening to you.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.696
A blind child to take care of.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.489
Strange boarders living under our roof.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.909
-The wallpaper is cracking.
-We just got this wallpaper.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.244
-Well, it's already out of style.
-I'm not going blind.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.205
-Don't worry.
-I'm so happy to hear that.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.040
-I missed you.
-I missed you too, Vin.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.708
I have so much gossip for you.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.628
I'm sorry. I don't have time.
I have to get back to work.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.756
Wait, why are you rushing?

12:35.839 --> 12:37.883
You've been away for three days.
Don't you want to say hello?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.593
No. I want to write.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.345
My mind is bursting with ideas.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.972
No, the doctor said you shouldn't be
writing. It's bad for your eyes, Emily.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.183
Then stab my eyes out and be done with it.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.520
I don't need my eyes to see. I don't.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.522
All I need is my soul.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.565
That's what I see the truth with.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.902
And the truth can be seen by a blind man,
so let me be blind.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.029
As long as I have my poetry,
I'm not afraid of the dark.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.114
See? Everything's going to be all right.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.324
Em, wait up.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.909
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.119
Sue wants to know,
are you coming to the party tonight?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.830
No. But, Austin, please tell Sue
that she has to come over and see me.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.666
She's at our house, getting ready.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.335
-But I need to talk to her.
-Yes, and she wants to talk to you too.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.755
That's why she specifically asked me
to ask you to come to the party tonight.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.591
Okay, well, tell Sue that I can't come
to the party tonight.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.094
Tell her that you told me that she
told you to tell me to come over,

13:22.177 --> 13:23.929
but I'm telling you that she should come,
but that I told you--

13:24.012 --> 13:25.722
I'm tired of playing messenger
between you two.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.475
Just come to the party.
We live right next door.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.271
You know, sometimes that lawn
feels like it's 100 miles long.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.778
Was I even invited to the party?

13:39.862 --> 13:41.613
Mom, we all have to go to the party.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.949
Sue's salons are the talk of New England.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.576
I memorized the write-up of the last one.

13:45.659 --> 13:50.622
"Mrs. Austin Dickinson of Amherst dazzled
at her latest well-attended soiree.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.375
The parlor of her splendid villa,
the Evergreens,

13:53.458 --> 13:56.920
was packed with a veritable
who's who list of New England society.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.924
Italian wine was served, and it was hard
to say which flowed more pleasantly,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.218
the liquor or the conversation."

14:03.802 --> 14:05.053
It is so crazy.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.181
Sue is an influencer.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.392
Really? I can't even believe I know her.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.435
And guess who's coming tonight?

14:12.269 --> 14:13.937
Ithamar Conkey?

14:14.438 --> 14:17.941
No. Mr. Samuel Bowles.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.402
The editor in chief
of The Springfield Republican.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.489
Sue has a connection to him.
And she networked, and he's coming.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.742
Mom, he's a media mogul.

14:26.825 --> 14:30.037
He could write about all of us
in the paper. We could all be famous.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.459
I have to find something to wear.
I need to wear something insane.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.752
I need to go change.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.962
Why do things have to change?

14:58.273 --> 15:02.027
The meadows - mine -
The mountains - mine -

15:03.612 --> 15:06.198
All Forests - stintless stars -

15:06.281 --> 15:08.408
As much of noon as I could take -

15:08.492 --> 15:10.661
Between my finite eyes -

15:11.370 --> 15:15.290
The motions of the dipping Birds -
The morning's amber Road -

15:16.041 --> 15:18.377
For mine - to look at when I liked,

15:20.629 --> 15:22.256
The news would strike me dead -

15:27.261 --> 15:30.097
Hi, Maggie.
I didn't even know you were in here.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.182
A good maid knows how to be invisible.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.811
You've been writing so much.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.105
Soon it'll take up the whole trunk.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.399
We'll have to find a new place
for your nighties.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.860
Will you put the sheets on top of them
so they stay hidden?

15:44.570 --> 15:47.114
Your whole family knows
you're a poet now, don't they?

15:47.781 --> 15:49.867
I still like to keep a few secrets.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.247
I'll let you get back to your work.

15:55.747 --> 15:59.918
Though I don't know how you can write with
all that racket over at Sue and Austin's.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.254
Sounds like they're doing
all the latest jigs.

16:26.612 --> 16:27.446
Let's go.

16:34.453 --> 16:37.164
Place is sick! And they got oysters!

16:37.247 --> 16:39.791
Oysters are actually a cheap
and widely available food.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.878
-Yo, Shipley.
-Dickinson!

16:43.420 --> 16:46.173
You look like you're doing well, man.
Look at this place.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.300
Well, my dad made me partner in the firm.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.385
That is awesome, bro.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.054
I'm a businessman myself.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.014
We should discuss our portfolios.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.891
Yeah. Well, I hope I see you around, man.

16:55.974 --> 16:59.269
You will. I'm living with your parents.
And your sister and I are engaged.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.021
We are not.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.273
We're engaged to be engaged
but we're taking it slow, you know?

17:04.358 --> 17:06.777
-Out of respect.
-Okay.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.030
I hope he treats you better
than Joseph Lyman.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.617
-I can handle myself.
-Lyman! What happened to him?

17:13.700 --> 17:14.952
He went down to New Orleans.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.538
Oh, word. Nola.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.330
The Big Easy, right?

17:19.414 --> 17:22.209
Yeah. I heard it's super chill
down there. Yeah.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.546
And the tobacco is mad cheap.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.214
Yeah. Because of slavery.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.098
I'm loving the pianist.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.809
I've never heard this piece before.
Is this Handel?

17:38.892 --> 17:40.227
I think so.

17:40.310 --> 17:43.146
-Well, I can't Handel it.
-Abby.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.106
Okay.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.941
We should start a string quartet, guys.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.819
We tried, but Toshiaki
never showed up for rehearsals.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.237
I was doing calligraphy.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.489
-Jane, you should just go solo.
-Yeah, I should.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.825
What about a book club?
Can we start a book club?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.410
Sure, what do you wanna read?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.578
I don't know. Emerson?

17:57.661 --> 17:58.954
Emerson is canceled.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.831
Oh, okay. Melville?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.207
How about Hawthorne?

18:02.291 --> 18:04.334
You know all those guys
just sleep with each other?

18:04.418 --> 18:06.295
-That's cool.
-I know it's cool.

18:06.378 --> 18:09.673
Anyway, I don't have time for a book club.
My life is crazy.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.425
Oh, my God, Jane, it is.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.594
I have a baby. And I'm a widow.

18:13.677 --> 18:14.970
I don't know how she does it.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.973
I can't believe my husband died
right after I gave birth.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.268
Honestly, you are so strong,
and we are so proud of you.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.645
I actually fainted yesterday.

18:23.729 --> 18:25.814
Of course you fainted. You're a widow.

18:25.898 --> 18:26.982
I know.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.318
Bravo.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.614
I love your dress.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.199
Oh. Thanks.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.576
Did Betty make it for you?

18:38.577 --> 18:40.954
Oh, no, I don't shop at Betty's anymore.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.247
It's from New York.

18:42.915 --> 18:46.001
Actually, the original design
is from Vienna.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.511
Give her some space.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.596
-She fainted.
-So cool.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.488
-Evening papers.
-Thank you.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.198
-Can you make it to the barn tonight?
-Yeah, I'll try.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.533
You know these parties always go late.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.410
We'll be working all night, okay?

20:01.952 --> 20:05.122
The evening papers. Speaking of
the papers, where is Mr. Bowles?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.832
I thought he'd be here by now.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.834
Sue, I came to see you.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.169
What's wrong with your eyes?

20:10.252 --> 20:13.338
The doctor wasn't sure. Iritis, I guess.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.341
No, Emily.
You have ink all over your face.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.343
Here. Come with me.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.771
Only you would show up at a party
looking like a raccoon.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.983
I'm not here for the party.
I'm here to see you.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.360
As long as I can still see,
I wanna look at you.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.780
Well, I'm hosting.

20:38.864 --> 20:41.992
You're always hosting.
You spread yourself so thin.

20:42.075 --> 20:45.037
Come on, I've been waiting all day.
All week.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.455
-I need to know.
-Emily.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.290
What did you think of my poems?
Tell me.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.000
I loved them.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.002
You did?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.421
Oh, thank God.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.423
Thank God.

20:56.965 --> 21:00.135
I always love your poems.
But these new ones, they were...

21:01.929 --> 21:03.055
-What?
-Beyond.

21:04.348 --> 21:07.809
Say more. Please.
Come on, say more, say more. Say more.

21:09.144 --> 21:12.105
Reading them, it's like, it's like my...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.859
it's like my heart almost explodes.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.569
Oh, Sue.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.613
That's what I want.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.156
That's what I want you to feel.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.451
Yeah.

21:25.661 --> 21:28.455
It's--
Sometimes it can be almost too much.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.707
It...

21:31.917 --> 21:33.502
It can be so painful.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.630
What do you-- What do you mean?

21:39.842 --> 21:42.594
It's just that your poems, they...

21:43.720 --> 21:44.721
What?

21:46.265 --> 21:50.352
They make me feel things
that I don't want to feel.

21:53.981 --> 21:54.982
Like what?

21:59.319 --> 22:01.238
Like when I lost the baby.

22:02.948 --> 22:03.949
Oh, Sue.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.328
Stupid to call it a baby, I suppose.

22:08.412 --> 22:09.621
No, it's not.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.166
It wasn't a baby... yet.

22:14.877 --> 22:16.879
But it was something. And...

22:19.923 --> 22:21.133
then it was gone.

22:27.723 --> 22:32.728
Do you ever... talk to Austin about it?

22:32.811 --> 22:35.105
No. No, he knows nothing.

22:35.189 --> 22:37.816
-And you swore...
-I know I did.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.694
-...never to tell him.
-I know. I won't, I promise you, I won't.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.665
God, look at me.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.919
I'm supposed to be out there
hosting a salon,

22:57.628 --> 22:59.880
and I'm in here on the verge of tears.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.342
Why do you always do that to me?

23:05.093 --> 23:07.846
Listen. I'm so glad that you came tonight

23:07.930 --> 23:11.225
because there's someone coming
to this party that I need you to meet.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.436
In fact, I specifically invited him
so that you could be introduced.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.771
What? Who?

23:16.313 --> 23:19.816
Sam Bowles, editor in chief
of The Springfield Republican.

23:19.900 --> 23:24.947
He's a powerful man, very good taste,
and he loves to publish women.

23:25.781 --> 23:28.367
Emily, this could be the man
to put you in the spotlight.

23:30.953 --> 23:33.372
You mean... publish my poems?

23:33.455 --> 23:35.832
Yes. Emily, it's time.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.709
You need to share your writing
with the world.

23:37.793 --> 23:39.920
But you know I can't publish.
My father won't approve.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.631
Oh, come on.
Don't give me that old excuse.

23:43.257 --> 23:46.301
You're an adult now.
You have to make your own choices.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.095
You can't let your father
stand in the way anymore.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.805
I'm not. I can't.

23:49.888 --> 23:50.973
You can!

23:51.598 --> 23:53.642
Your poems are works of genius.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.937
And you owe it to the world
to let them be seen.

23:58.272 --> 24:02.109
I don't need the world to see them.
I only need you--

24:02.192 --> 24:04.403
Well, I can't be your only reader anymore.

24:05.529 --> 24:08.323
It's not enough. You need more.

24:09.116 --> 24:12.411
And that's why
I've invited this man tonight.

24:12.494 --> 24:16.290
This man who is going to fall in love
with your poems.

24:25.174 --> 24:27.050
Mr. Bowles, you're here.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.888
I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else.
How are you, Suzie? What's new?

24:31.430 --> 24:36.143
Sam, I'd like you to meet
my sister-in-law, Emily Dickinson.

24:36.226 --> 24:40.314
Of course. The famous poet.
I've heard all about you.

24:40.397 --> 24:42.482
Oh. Nobody's heard of me.

24:43.317 --> 24:46.320
Well, it's my job to know things
before other people find out.

24:46.862 --> 24:50.657
I'm a newsman. I gotta keep my ear to
the ground. I gotta stay one step ahead.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.119
The world is changing fast and so is
the news business, I'll tell you.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.666
What's all over your face?

25:01.251 --> 25:02.836
Oh, it's ink.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.090
You're interesting.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.676
I'm interested.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.683
I've been in five cities
in the last three days, Suzie,

25:16.767 --> 25:20.270
zipping around the railroad,
meeting people, so many people.

25:20.896 --> 25:23.273
It is a crazy time to be alive.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.610
You know, Mr. Bowles was the one
who made The Springfield Republican

25:26.693 --> 25:29.112
into a daily paper instead of a weekly.

25:29.196 --> 25:30.656
That was his innovation.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.866
Move fast and break stuff.

25:32.950 --> 25:35.619
I am seriously addicted to the news.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.123
Well, like I said,
I've heard so much about you.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.126
Apparently,
you can write like nobody's business.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.212
She's a genius, Sam.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.548
I know she's going to be
your new discovery.

25:49.424 --> 25:52.344
So? When do I get to read a poem?

25:54.805 --> 25:58.267
Emily, you could recite one for us.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.351
Right now.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.769
I'd love to hear it.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.839
Nobody?

26:33.135 --> 26:34.136
Emily?

26:37.472 --> 26:38.974
Come on, this is your moment.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.060
So safer -

26:44.104 --> 26:46.940
guess - with just my soul

26:48.358 --> 26:49.860
Opon the window pane

26:51.778 --> 26:53.947
Where other creatures put their eyes -

26:56.950 --> 26:59.203
Incautious - of the Sun -

27:12.799 --> 27:15.219
There's something wrong with her.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.180
Not tonight.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.475
-Please.
-I would prefer not to.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.025
Typical Emily Dickinson.

27:30.108 --> 27:31.318
She's a lot.

27:43.997 --> 27:47.084
Do you want a new America?
Do you want a new America?

27:47.167 --> 27:51.672
Our paper is called The Constellation.
We are bringing change, revolution.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.132
Each of us is gonna do our part.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.226
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Thanks.
