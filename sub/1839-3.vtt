I MEAN, DISPOSED
OF THEM ALL.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.500
RAVEN, HOW DO YOU EXPECT
TO BE SUCCESSFUL

20:02.500 --> 20:03.200
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY

20:03.200 --> 20:06.300
IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE
ONE SIMPLE JOB?

20:06.300 --> 20:09.200
I'M SORRY, MISS CABONNA,
NO DISRESPECT,

20:09.200 --> 20:11.967
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW SORTING DOG FOOD

20:11.967 --> 20:14.100
IS GONNA HELP ME
IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.767
RAVEN,
[CLEARS THROAT]

20:15.767 --> 20:17.400
DO YOU KNOW
HOW I GOT STARTED?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.767
YES!
OF COURSE I DO!

20:19.767 --> 20:21.367
YOU WERE THE YOUNGEST
FASHION DESIGNER

20:21.367 --> 20:24.367
TO HAVE HER OWN LINE.
OH, YOU ARE MY IDOL!

20:24.367 --> 20:28.000
OF COURSE I AM.
BUT BEFORE
I BECAME ALL THAT,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.500
I INTERNED
FOR YVONNE ST. LABURVE.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.967
REALLY?
SHE IS A FABULOUS DESIGNER.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.600
SHE MADE MY LIFE MISERABLE!

20:36.600 --> 20:40.100
SHE HAD ME DOING
ALL OF HER SHOPPING,

20:40.100 --> 20:42.467
AND CLEANING HER HOUSE,

20:42.467 --> 20:44.200
AND SHAMPOOING HER MONKEY,

20:44.200 --> 20:47.600
WHO, BY THE WAY,
HAD A VERY, VERY
UNHEALTHY CRUSH ON ME.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.700
MONKEY LOVE IS NOT RIGHT.
THAT IS NOT COOL.

20:50.700 --> 20:51.700
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:51.700 --> 20:54.300
BUT HOW DID THAT HELP YOU
WITH FASHION?

20:54.300 --> 20:54.900
IT DIDN'T,

20:54.900 --> 20:58.400
BUT IT DID HELP ME LEARN
ABOUT DISCIPLINE,

20:58.400 --> 21:00.934
HARD WORK AND PATIENCE,

21:00.934 --> 21:03.500
WHICH ARE ALL THINGS
YOU NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.233
MM-HMM, YES.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:06.233 --> 21:08.300
I UNDERSTAND.
I REALLY DO.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.500
IT'S JUST THAT I WAS
JUST SO EXCITED TO BE HERE

21:11.500 --> 21:12.300
I THOUGHT I WOULD--

21:12.300 --> 21:16.033
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT
I WOULD DOING SOMETHING
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.800
OH, RAVEN.

21:17.800 --> 21:24.867
YOU HAVE TALENT
AND ENTHUSIASM,

21:24.867 --> 21:26.934
BUT IT'S ONLY
YOUR FIRST DAY.

21:26.934 --> 21:29.033
PACE YOURSELF, DEAR.

21:29.033 --> 21:31.600
OK. YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.200
OH, FOR ALL
YOUR WISDOM AND LOVE--

21:34.200 --> 21:36.700
OK, NOW DISAPPEAR.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.600
DONNA!
DONNA!

21:38.600 --> 21:40.300
I CAME BACK AS SOON
AS I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.033
I CAN'T BELIEVE NEWBAR
MISSED HIS CLASS.

21:43.033 --> 21:47.000
THAT IS SO UNLIKE HIM.
I'M GONNA GIVE HIM A CALL.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
DOES THIS LOOK
OFF-BALANCE TO YOU?

21:50.900 --> 21:53.567
TIFFANY!
MY FARDAY!

21:53.567 --> 21:54.400
I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!

21:54.400 --> 21:57.834
TIFFANY, HOW COULD YOU?
GOTTA GO.
