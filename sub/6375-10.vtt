WEBVTT

00:03.297 --> 00:05.287
Genuine Prada!

00:05.830 --> 00:09.926
Oh, my God. $2 a pair in Chinatown.
Can you believe it?

00:10.235 --> 00:12.430
Hilda, that says Plada.

00:12.470 --> 00:13.937
What?

00:14.472 --> 00:16.097
Oh?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.664
Well, my customers
won't know the difference,

00:17.708 --> 00:21.473
and since I'm turning my salon
into a salonlboutique,

00:21.511 --> 00:23.638
I got to sell something.

00:24.614 --> 00:27.480
You know, I thought
that two people living together

00:27.516 --> 00:29.507
was supposed to be cheaper
than one person,

00:29.551 --> 00:33.646
but how come ever since Amanda's
moved in, I'm paying twice as much?

00:33.688 --> 00:36.212
So, don't let her eat your stuff.
Put your name on it.

00:38.224 --> 00:39.282
Oh?

00:39.592 --> 00:42.424
I feel like all I do is work.
I can barely pay my rent,

00:42.461 --> 00:45.396
oh, which is due tomorrow.
I almost forgot.

00:45.798 --> 00:47.992
Is juice-moocher pitching in?

00:48.032 --> 00:50.193
Well, I've been dropping hints all week.

00:50.234 --> 00:53.100
Yeah? Have you tried,
"Where's my rent, bitch?"

00:53.136 --> 00:54.501
No.

00:54.538 --> 00:58.735
Look, Amanda has been through
some really tough times lately.

00:58.774 --> 01:01.208
She made some bad decisions, yes,

01:01.243 --> 01:04.075
and she got herself into a lot of debt.

01:04.111 --> 01:08.013
But I really do think, like,
she's trying to turn her life around.

01:09.750 --> 01:13.048
You will not believe
how much money I saved today.

01:15.955 --> 01:17.148
Huge sale.

01:17.189 --> 01:19.749
I had to get up crazy early
to beat the crowds.

01:19.791 --> 01:21.315
That's a lie. I was actually out clubbing,

01:21.360 --> 01:25.796
and I figured what the hell? I'll just
stay up all night. It was totally worth it.

01:25.963 --> 01:32.525
Um, Amanda, buying stuff on sale,
that's not exactly saving money.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.261
- Isn't it?
- No.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.897
- Isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

01:37.939 --> 01:42.000
And if you don't mind me asking,
how did you pay for all of this?

01:42.076 --> 01:45.145
Well, I've been saving so much money
since I moved in with you

01:45.145 --> 01:47.409
that I actually paid off one credit card,

01:47.447 --> 01:51.507
so I figured I might as well
just treat myself and splurge a little.

01:51.550 --> 01:53.211
"Where's the rent, bitch?"

01:53.418 --> 01:55.886
Okay, okay. Amanda?

01:55.920 --> 01:59.013
I gotta go! And, Betty, do not worry.

01:59.056 --> 02:02.389
I'm going to catch up on my sleep
at work, per yooz!

02:02.993 --> 02:04.516
- Bye!
- But...

02:07.063 --> 02:09.553
Amanda! Amanda.

02:09.598 --> 02:12.192
Look, the rent is due tomorrow,
and I need your half.

02:12.234 --> 02:15.498
Okay, and I would love to give it to you,
I would, but I'm a little bit short.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.037
Well, then why don't you just return
all that stuff you bought?

02:18.072 --> 02:20.403
Yeah. The thing is
there's no return on sale items.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.840
Could you just cover me this month?
You know I'm good for it.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.002
Amanda, you are not good for it!

02:25.044 --> 02:27.410
Look, it's bad enough
I have to go all the way downtown

02:27.446 --> 02:32.576
and pay that creepy, gross landlord,
who's weird and leers at me,

02:32.617 --> 02:34.448
but if I have to give him your half,

02:34.485 --> 02:36.645
then I'm gonna be
completely wiped out.

02:36.686 --> 02:40.451
Look, if you want to keep living with me,

02:40.489 --> 02:43.185
then you're going to have
to chip something in.

02:43.225 --> 02:45.056
I totally get it.

02:47.128 --> 02:49.392
Would you spot me a subway ride?

02:50.931 --> 02:52.023
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

02:52.099 --> 02:55.465
Talking to some intern,
the one you made cry.

02:55.501 --> 02:57.833
Well, I can't hide in here all day.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.565
How much longer
is he going to stand there?

02:59.972 --> 03:02.531
<i>- I don't know.
- What is he saying?</i>

03:02.574 --> 03:03.768
They're too far away.

03:03.909 --> 03:05.536
Well, read their lips.

03:05.577 --> 03:07.066
Hang on.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.547
Okay. They're laughing.

03:11.748 --> 03:12.806
Ha, ha ha.

03:12.849 --> 03:15.340
Laughing at me, I know it.

03:15.485 --> 03:19.443
He's telling her how that remarkably
well-preserved Editor-in-Chief

03:19.488 --> 03:21.285
tried to get him in the sack.

03:21.356 --> 03:23.687
<i>God, Marc, I feel like such a fool.</i>

03:23.758 --> 03:27.318
Willie, wouldn't it be easier
if you just talked to him? Oh wait! Wait!

03:28.161 --> 03:32.256
He's on the move. Now's your chance.
Go! Go! Go, go, go, go!

03:36.135 --> 03:38.295
- Hi, Wilhelmina.
- Shut up!

03:42.306 --> 03:46.299
Wait! He's coming back!
Abort! Abort! Repeat! Abort!

03:47.610 --> 03:49.771
For God's sakes, Willie,
get out of there!

03:51.948 --> 03:55.542
- Wilhelmina, morning.
- Top of the morning to you.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.519
<i>"Top of the morning
to you"?</i>

04:00.588 --> 04:03.021
I actually said, "Top of the morning,"
to the man, Marc.

04:03.056 --> 04:05.524
Oh, don't blame yourself.
You should hear some of the things

04:05.558 --> 04:08.117
that come out of my mouth
when I'm around him.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.596
And why do I even care
what he thinks? He's just a man.

04:12.498 --> 04:16.024
A man with the most ruthlessly
sharp business mind I've ever seen,

04:16.067 --> 04:17.591
impeccable fashion sense...

04:17.635 --> 04:19.932
Tantalizingly large hands.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.938
Excuse me? Wilhelmina?

04:23.672 --> 04:26.732
- Oh, dear God, is it... Is it time? Marc!
- It's not in my calendar.

04:26.775 --> 04:28.867
Relax. It's just the baby kicking.

04:28.943 --> 04:31.741
I'm not due
for another couple of months.

04:32.213 --> 04:36.672
That's a relief. So, why are you here?

04:37.284 --> 04:38.979
I've got my seven-month checkup
this afternoon.

04:39.019 --> 04:42.784
I just wondered if you might want
to make a surprise appearance.

04:42.822 --> 04:44.914
Christina, I've got a lot on my mind
at the moment,

04:44.956 --> 04:47.288
and one of the reasons
I hired you as my surrogate

04:47.325 --> 04:50.225
was for the fierce independence
of the Scottish people.

04:50.261 --> 04:54.630
Your entire country would be insulted
if I held your hand at the doctor's office.

04:54.664 --> 04:57.189
- You're our Braveheart.
- Our Brave Uterus.

04:57.233 --> 05:00.497
Wilhelmina.
One thing I wanted to mention...

05:02.271 --> 05:03.295
Is this a good time?

05:04.273 --> 05:08.834
Connor, it's always a good time
to discuss business,

05:08.910 --> 05:11.878
<i>Mode business, Meade business,
suit business.</i>

05:14.247 --> 05:17.340
I have a marketing presentation
this afternoon at Ralph Lauren.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.146
It'd be great if we could do it together.

05:20.319 --> 05:24.880
Darn it all, I have an important
appointment with my surrogate

05:24.923 --> 05:26.253
that I have to attend.

05:26.290 --> 05:28.781
Well, that's obviously
much more important.

05:28.825 --> 05:29.985
I'll fill you in when I get back.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.420
Well, you know where to find me, mate!

05:42.069 --> 05:43.866
Good morning, Daniel!

05:43.904 --> 05:46.804
I just want to remind you
that there's only a week left

05:46.839 --> 05:49.034
till my Young Editors' Training begins.

05:49.075 --> 05:50.770
Betty, how could I forget?

05:52.611 --> 05:56.843
Oh well, I want you to know
that my being a part of YETI

05:56.881 --> 05:59.577
will not interrupt my work here at all.

05:59.617 --> 06:04.349
In fact, I am available
for any possible overtime.

06:04.387 --> 06:08.254
Okay, well, I have some good news
and some bad news.

06:08.324 --> 06:11.521
The bad news is we're eliminating
overtime. Budget cuts.

06:11.594 --> 06:15.427
What? Oh, no, no, no, no!
Daniel, I need my overtime.

06:15.463 --> 06:19.159
The good news is we're looking
for pitches for modeny. com.

06:19.466 --> 06:23.196
Pitches? As in, like, articles?

06:23.236 --> 06:25.466
Yeah, we're expanding
our digital footprint.

06:25.504 --> 06:28.563
We're gonna need lots of new content.
You're creative. You'd be perfect.

06:28.607 --> 06:31.041
Yes! Yes, I would! I would be perfect!

06:31.076 --> 06:33.566
And the pay is not that great.
Standard freelance fee.

06:33.611 --> 06:35.943
Yeah, whatever. Whatever. Fine.
It's fine. I'm fine with that.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.743
Knock, knock. Am I interrupting?

06:39.682 --> 06:41.741
No, we were just finishing up here.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.614
Hi, I'm Molly.

06:43.685 --> 06:46.813
Oh? Hi. You must be Connor's fiancée.

06:46.888 --> 06:48.355
This is Betty, my assistant.

06:48.423 --> 06:52.222
So, we have that pitch meeting at 3:00.
You better get cracking. We'll see you.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.056
Nice to meet you.

06:54.861 --> 06:58.058
Hey! What's up?

06:58.098 --> 06:59.462
I'm having lunch with Connor today,

06:59.498 --> 07:01.056
and it seemed
like the perfect opportunity

07:01.100 --> 07:04.035
to hit up all the rich jerks
he works with.

07:04.602 --> 07:06.695
That didn't come out right.

07:06.738 --> 07:09.604
Since I work at a public school,
we're always short of funds.

07:09.640 --> 07:14.009
So, every year I host a charity auction
to raise money for school programs.

07:14.044 --> 07:17.809
And you thought you'd hit up Connor's
"rich jerk" friends for donations.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.813
It's a column "A," column "B" thing.

07:19.848 --> 07:23.249
You're not a jerk, but you are rich,
so you qualify.

07:24.219 --> 07:26.277
- I would love to help.
- That's awesome.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.086
Anyhow, it's tonight and
Connor can't make it. Work, as usual.

07:30.124 --> 07:32.523
So I was hoping you could step in.

07:32.558 --> 07:33.650
Oh.

07:33.693 --> 07:35.421
You... You want me to go?

07:35.460 --> 07:40.159
Well, yeah. I just thought you were
so great with my kids at school,

07:40.198 --> 07:44.759
I thought you'd have fun.
Unless... You don't want to go.

07:44.802 --> 07:46.701
- No, no, no! I was just...
- I know, it's late notice.

07:46.736 --> 07:47.930
I just thought
we'd gotten to be friends...

07:47.971 --> 07:50.132
- No, I'd love to.
- Okay.

07:52.608 --> 07:55.133
- I'll see you tonight.
- Great.

07:55.844 --> 07:57.071
Okay.

08:01.049 --> 08:02.709
Oh. Hi.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.376
Hello, dear.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:15.026 --> 08:19.155
There he goes again.
Little bugger's a bloody acrobat.

08:19.196 --> 08:21.221
Though sometimes I think
I would rather keep him in there

08:21.298 --> 08:23.265
than let Wilhelmina look after him.

08:23.299 --> 08:26.735
You should have seen her
this morning. I swear she is going daft.

08:26.803 --> 08:27.791
I bet.

08:28.937 --> 08:33.532
Look! Is that those little crackers?
I love these. The little sesame ones.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.972
- Do you mind?
- No. Sure.

08:40.013 --> 08:42.809
I haven't eaten since yesterday,
but whatever.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.406
What are you talking about?

08:44.450 --> 08:46.281
Money's gotten really tight.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.410
I warned you that that place
was too expensive, didn't I?

08:48.453 --> 08:50.387
You just said you'd have to eat ramen.

08:50.421 --> 08:54.288
Which would have worked
if Amanda wasn't eating all my ramen,

08:54.324 --> 08:55.586
and she denies it.

08:55.659 --> 08:58.354
She says there's an old crazy man
who lives inside my walls

08:58.427 --> 09:00.327
and comes out at night to eat my food.

09:00.363 --> 09:01.625
She calls him Bad Ronald.

09:01.664 --> 09:04.461
I've seen your apartment.
She might be right.

09:04.499 --> 09:06.399
I don't know, Christina.

09:06.434 --> 09:10.392
Moving into that building
was supposed to like a dream.

09:10.437 --> 09:12.769
My first apartment in Manhattan.

09:12.806 --> 09:16.832
Well, stop fretting! Live your dream.
Go. Have a bit of fun! Enjoy yourself!

09:16.876 --> 09:19.139
I would love to, but fun costs money.

09:19.177 --> 09:22.340
Ah, it doesn't have to.
See, when I first came to New York,

09:22.381 --> 09:25.144
I didn't have two dimes to rub together,
but I didn't care.

09:25.182 --> 09:29.312
There I was, young, free, living in
the most exciting city in the world.

09:29.386 --> 09:33.652
Oh, I had a grand old time, me,
and it usually didn't cost me a cent.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.394
We really want modeny. com
to be different.

09:38.394 --> 09:41.328
We're looking for ideas that are edgy,
ahead of the curve.

09:41.362 --> 09:43.830
<i>Mode magazine for the digital age.</i>

09:43.865 --> 09:45.354
Now, the sky's the limit,

09:45.399 --> 09:48.732
which is why I opened up this meeting
to the entire staff.

09:48.769 --> 09:51.862
- And Betty has something.
- Thank you, Daniel.

09:51.904 --> 09:54.737
As we all know,
living in Manhattan can be expensive.

09:54.774 --> 09:56.866
Really? I hadn't noticed.

09:56.908 --> 09:58.739
There's no need to be sarcastic,
Wilhelmina.

09:58.777 --> 10:01.836
No, I honestly have never noticed.

10:01.912 --> 10:03.641
Well, it is, for most of us.

10:03.714 --> 10:06.273
So, I've come up with a super fun list
of things to do

10:06.349 --> 10:07.714
in New York for no money.

10:07.750 --> 10:11.082
I'm calling it
"A Day in Manhattan on Zero Dollars. "

10:11.119 --> 10:13.280
Well, that sounds promising.
What have you come up with?

10:13.321 --> 10:16.653
Well, most museums have one day
a week where you can go for free,

10:16.690 --> 10:21.285
but the National American Indian
Museum is free every day.

10:21.327 --> 10:24.262
Its culturally sensitive
and thought-provoking exhibits

10:24.297 --> 10:27.026
include pottery, basketry...

10:31.769 --> 10:33.828
I thought your pitch
was how to have fun in the city,

10:33.871 --> 10:36.066
not put yourself into a coma.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.300
It is a little dry, Betty.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.433
Oh?

10:39.543 --> 10:45.378
Right. Okay, well, you can feed
the squirrels in Madison Square Park.

10:45.414 --> 10:48.075
Or you could feed my brain a bullet.

10:50.685 --> 10:55.348
Okay, well, maybe Marc
and Amanda have better ideas.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.680
For free? Let's see.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.953
Oh, I crashed the red carpet
at that Tom Cruise movie.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.357
He is super short,

11:01.394 --> 11:03.588
but the food at the after-party
was beyond.

11:03.628 --> 11:07.359
<i>But the average Mode reader doesn't
really have access to Tom Cruise.</i>

11:07.399 --> 11:09.457
Oh, no, you would be surprised
what you can get away with.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.522
Like what?

11:10.634 --> 11:13.500
Like I haven't paid for a drink
or a meal in years.

11:13.536 --> 11:15.936
I have a bar tab of, like, 10 grand.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.167
Now, that's an article for our website.

11:18.208 --> 11:22.405
I love it. "How I Blew 10 Grand
Without Actually Spending a Dime. "

11:22.444 --> 11:26.971
Congratulations. You and Amanda just
sold the first article to modeny. com.

11:27.014 --> 11:30.540
<i>Ow. My first sale at Mode.
That was easy.</i>

11:50.333 --> 11:51.493
You're not going to believe this.

11:51.534 --> 11:53.365
So, we had this huge
pitch meeting today,

11:53.402 --> 11:55.801
and they want to use one of my ideas
for an article.

11:55.837 --> 11:58.465
<i>Oh, my God! Papi! Pick up the phone!
Betty sold a story!</i>

11:58.507 --> 12:00.599
No, no. Sort of.
You see, I had this really great idea...

12:00.641 --> 12:04.509
You sold a story? Amazing!
What is it about?

12:04.545 --> 12:06.876
Well, it was supposed to be
about how to have fun in New York

12:06.913 --> 12:08.141
without spending any money.

12:08.181 --> 12:10.671
Well, you got
the "no money" part down.

12:10.716 --> 12:13.207
Yeah, but the problem
is that Amanda glommed on,

12:13.252 --> 12:14.981
and now she's got these crazy ideas

12:15.020 --> 12:17.510
about crashing
Tom Cruise's premiere...

12:17.555 --> 12:19.580
You're meeting TomKat?
You have to get me in!

12:19.657 --> 12:21.783
No, Justin. I'm not meeting TomKat.

12:21.858 --> 12:24.827
Look, the point is
Amanda wants to turn my idea

12:24.861 --> 12:26.885
into some wild, crazy night on the town,

12:26.929 --> 12:29.625
spending thousands of dollars
of other people's money.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.189
- And that's a problem?
- Well, yes!

12:32.233 --> 12:36.225
A, it's not my idea,
and, B, she's just being a mooch again.

12:36.270 --> 12:39.569
- Sounds like it might be fun.
- Yeah. Aunt Betty, you got to go for it.

12:39.606 --> 12:41.732
Okay, let's grip it and rip it.

12:41.774 --> 12:43.401
I got to go.

12:43.976 --> 12:46.705
Look, if we are going to do this,
then there need to be

12:46.745 --> 12:47.803
some ground rules.

12:47.846 --> 12:50.144
One, nothing illegal.

12:50.215 --> 12:54.173
<i>Two, we can only do things
that normal Mode readers can do.</i>

12:54.251 --> 12:58.186
Got it. No crimes. Real peeps.
Saddle up.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.156
- Hello, Daniel.
- Oh, hey.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.463
Hey, which one of these
brings out my eyes?

13:09.897 --> 13:11.228
Big plans?

13:11.265 --> 13:13.698
No. I'm just helping Molly out
with some charity thing.

13:13.733 --> 13:14.757
Oh?

13:14.801 --> 13:17.928
Molly. Shouldn't Connor be doing that?

13:18.070 --> 13:20.061
He's busy. It's no big deal.

13:20.105 --> 13:24.768
Are you sure? A lot of other people
she could have invited instead of you.

13:25.743 --> 13:28.336
- I think she likes you.
- No.

13:31.148 --> 13:32.308
Really?

13:32.349 --> 13:33.372
Mmm-hmm.

13:33.482 --> 13:37.714
And if I know my son,
it's pretty obvious that you like her, too.

13:39.387 --> 13:42.754
Well, there is something
about her that's...

13:42.791 --> 13:44.883
Ow! What the hell, Mom?

13:44.925 --> 13:48.690
She's engaged, Daniel,
and not just to any man,

13:48.728 --> 13:51.891
to your friend and a senior
financial officer at this company.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.831
There is nothing going on
between Molly and me.

13:54.900 --> 13:59.666
- Ow. Stop that!
- I am not blind, Daniel, or stupid.

14:00.838 --> 14:06.070
I know a thing or two about infidelity.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.703
Don't go down that road.

14:10.512 --> 14:13.276
Okay. This is a fundraiser, not a date.

14:13.315 --> 14:15.578
There's going to be a lot
of other people around, Mom.

14:15.617 --> 14:17.812
And she'll look stunning
and the booze will be flowing,

14:17.852 --> 14:21.309
and given your weakness
for having sex in public places...

14:21.355 --> 14:25.256
That was only once,
and it wasn't a public place, Mom,

14:25.291 --> 14:26.724
until they moved the truck.

14:26.759 --> 14:30.489
Darling, I'm trying to save you
from a world of heartache.

14:31.196 --> 14:34.632
A "nothing" moment
can turn into something huge.

14:34.699 --> 14:38.896
Just... Just stay away.
Write her a big check.

14:43.373 --> 14:44.601
Okay.

14:59.452 --> 15:01.942
Look at the size of the feet on that!

15:02.021 --> 15:03.955
Hey, no wonder it feels
like there's a rugby match

15:03.989 --> 15:07.082
- going on down there. Look.
- Well, yes, yes. I saw it inside.

15:07.158 --> 15:08.182
You didn't even look.

15:08.259 --> 15:10.489
I can't believe you don't wanna know
if it's a girl or a boy.

15:10.528 --> 15:13.928
Call me old-fashioned.
I want to be surprised. Yes.

15:14.931 --> 15:17.125
The thunder from down under
keeps asking when you'll be back.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.361
<i>- What should I tell him?
- I don't care, Marc.</i>

15:19.435 --> 15:23.063
Tell him I'm tied up at the doctor's.
Tell him I got hit by a cab.

15:23.104 --> 15:25.504
Just tell me when he goes home.

15:28.175 --> 15:31.008
- What was all that about?
- Nothing.

15:31.045 --> 15:34.741
You know, I was thinking,
why rush back to the office?

15:35.515 --> 15:38.415
We should talk. Let's go have a drink.

15:38.450 --> 15:40.918
I'm seven months pregnant
with your child.

15:40.986 --> 15:44.921
Well, you can watch.
I'll drink for all three of us. Come on.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.258
What was that moisturizer again?

15:53.295 --> 15:55.263
Kanebo Sensai. Isn't it heaven?

15:55.698 --> 15:57.757
I'm on the fence.
Could I get a few samples?

15:57.800 --> 15:59.699
- Of course.
- And the Guerlain lipstick, too,

15:59.801 --> 16:01.701
and the H. Couture.

16:02.537 --> 16:04.800
- How we doing?
- Almost $800.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.930
It's a start.

16:05.972 --> 16:08.202
Amanda, I know we're not supposed
to be spending any money,

16:08.241 --> 16:10.333
but doesn't this make you feel
a little bit guilty

16:10.409 --> 16:12.377
just walking away
with all this free stuff?

16:12.445 --> 16:15.572
Betty, it's fine. Don't you ever
get free samples of ice cream?

16:15.647 --> 16:17.547
Yeah, but then I buy
an ice cream cone.

16:17.582 --> 16:18.571
Oh, of course you do.

16:18.650 --> 16:21.482
- There you go.
- Thank you.

16:22.419 --> 16:24.443
Time for some new rags.

16:25.321 --> 16:26.345
Thanks.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.591
What do you think?

16:37.631 --> 16:40.326
Wow. Well, how much is it?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.930
$2,000?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.027
All right, Miss Plan,
how we going to pay for this one?

16:46.105 --> 16:49.939
Fun fact. Most stores
have a 30-day return policy.

16:49.974 --> 16:52.408
So, you tuck the tag, wear them once,
bring them back.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.741
Ah. Amanda! That's illegal!

16:54.979 --> 16:58.004
It's immoral, but mainly, it's illegal,
which violates rule number one.

16:58.048 --> 17:01.039
<i>Remember rule number two?
Real Mode readers.</i>

17:01.083 --> 17:04.211
Is it fair that only Ivanka Trump
gets to wear dresses like this?

17:04.252 --> 17:07.847
No. Shouldn't frumpy girls from Queens
get to feel glamorous, too?

17:07.888 --> 17:10.153
Isn't that what this article is all about?

17:10.191 --> 17:11.487
Well, yeah, but...

17:12.726 --> 17:16.183
Oh, my God. Feel this.

17:16.229 --> 17:18.220
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Just feel it. It's so soft.

17:18.297 --> 17:20.857
- That is soft.
- I know. Right?

17:20.933 --> 17:24.265
Wouldn't you love to wear it just once?

17:25.436 --> 17:29.236
<i>Ain't gonna need your gloss, gloss
Never gonna need that cash, cash</i>

17:30.574 --> 17:32.302
<i>It's the ride of your life</i>

17:32.342 --> 17:35.800
<i>Every week, The Village Voice lists
all the gallery openings in Chelsea.</i>

17:35.845 --> 17:38.404
I always pick the ones
with the ugliest art.

17:38.447 --> 17:41.075
- Why?
- They have the best booze.

17:41.116 --> 17:42.343
They figure the drunker you are,

17:42.383 --> 17:44.374
the more likely you are
to actually buy all this crap.

17:44.418 --> 17:46.318
I actually think
this is really neat.

17:46.354 --> 17:47.479
Mmm-mmm.

17:47.521 --> 17:49.887
Okay, now I'm cutting you off.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.627
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, actually I am a little. I...

17:55.661 --> 17:57.992
'Cause I just spotted dinner.

18:00.465 --> 18:01.557
Oh!

18:01.900 --> 18:04.299
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Tuck your tag.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.665
- What?
- Tuck it!

18:05.702 --> 18:06.760
Oh.

18:10.106 --> 18:11.971
Hi.
Ciao.

18:12.008 --> 18:16.501
I couldn't help but notice you looking
at us. And by us, I mean me.

18:16.545 --> 18:21.743
Were we that obvious? I apologize.
Are you enjoying the opening?

18:21.816 --> 18:26.809
Well, I wasn't until I spotted
the two best-looking pieces here.

18:26.886 --> 18:28.148
Okay.

18:28.787 --> 18:32.245
And you? What is your favorite piece?

18:32.324 --> 18:37.226
Well, I'm not really an art kind of...
I mean, I like that one.

18:37.795 --> 18:39.318
This... What a coincidence.

18:39.362 --> 18:42.399
- I just buy this one.
- Really?

18:42.399 --> 18:44.832
We were about to go out
and celebrate his bad taste.

18:44.867 --> 18:45.959
Shh!

18:46.001 --> 18:47.628
Would you like to join us?

18:47.670 --> 18:49.637
- No, thank you.
- Absolutely.

18:50.271 --> 18:52.831
Would you mind excusing us
just for one second?

18:52.874 --> 18:55.171
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah, of course.

18:56.310 --> 18:57.971
- Amanda!
- Betty, what are you doing?

18:58.045 --> 19:00.103
Are you crazy?
We don't even know them.

19:00.179 --> 19:02.147
They're strangers. They could kill us.

19:02.181 --> 19:05.013
Betty, if we're going to write this article,
we have to live it,

19:05.050 --> 19:09.952
that means everything,
fun, art, fashion, sex.

19:09.987 --> 19:11.511
There isn't going to be any sex.

19:11.555 --> 19:13.887
- Isn't there?
- No! There isn't.

19:13.924 --> 19:17.222
Okay, fine. Scratch the sex,
but, Betty, I can't do this by myself.

19:17.260 --> 19:21.389
You're the writer. I thought
we were in this together, partners.

19:22.331 --> 19:23.764
Ladies?

19:30.937 --> 19:35.306
Okay. Yeah. Let's grip it and rip it.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.599
Don't do that.

19:45.783 --> 19:46.908
Oh.

19:46.950 --> 19:51.114
The sound of clinking ice cubes.
It's like a Scottish lullaby.

19:52.154 --> 19:58.353
Well, here's to the bundle of...
What's the expression? Joy?

19:58.393 --> 19:59.860
Cut the crap, Wilhelmina.

19:59.961 --> 20:02.952
You haven't even given
a second's thought to raising this baby,

20:02.997 --> 20:05.056
other than its stake
in the Meade empire.

20:05.099 --> 20:08.465
Oh! That's outrageous.
How can you say such a thing?

20:08.534 --> 20:11.833
I don't know. I mean, look at this place.
It's not even been baby-proofed.

20:11.871 --> 20:15.829
Dead baby! Dead baby! Dead baby!

20:15.874 --> 20:19.036
Sometimes I wonder
if you even want this child or not.

20:19.076 --> 20:22.045
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Really?

20:22.079 --> 20:23.807
I mean, you weren't even
going to come with me today

20:23.847 --> 20:26.714
until Connor asked you
to go to that meeting.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.744
And what exactly is going on
with you two anyway?

20:29.785 --> 20:32.049
You babbled like an idiot
when he walked in.

20:32.087 --> 20:34.884
- I do not babble.
- You babbled,

20:34.956 --> 20:39.221
and you've been avoiding him ever
since you got back from Key Largo.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.825
Did something happen?

20:41.862 --> 20:43.090
No.

20:44.063 --> 20:46.827
Oh, my God. He didn't!

20:46.866 --> 20:49.561
No, he didn't, unfortunately.

20:51.703 --> 20:53.398
You like him.

20:53.938 --> 20:56.099
So? Is that so strange

20:56.140 --> 20:59.700
that a woman like me wants someone
to spend the rest of her life with,

20:59.776 --> 21:03.507
someone to help raise her child,
do it right this time?

21:04.179 --> 21:07.273
I finally meet the perfect man,
and I can't have him.

21:07.883 --> 21:11.579
I may as well just resign myself
to never having a man around.

21:11.652 --> 21:13.779
Well, I wouldn't do that,

21:14.454 --> 21:17.389
'cause you're having a boy.

21:19.426 --> 21:21.222
- Really?
- Yes.

21:21.260 --> 21:24.593
Wilhelmina, you are having
a little baby boy.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.187
- A boy.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:32.803 --> 21:36.738
And then Betty rode her motorcycle
into a vat of Jell-O.

21:36.772 --> 21:39.400
I can't believe you didn't see it.
It was all over the Internet.

21:39.442 --> 21:41.909
It did get, like, over a million hits.

21:41.943 --> 21:43.342
Wow. Wow.

21:44.045 --> 21:45.103
Mmm.

21:45.446 --> 21:48.347
This champagne tastes so expensive.

21:49.116 --> 21:51.276
Life's too short
to drink cheap champagne.

21:51.317 --> 21:52.409
Oh!

21:53.553 --> 21:57.545
That is so true, Claudio, so true.

21:59.391 --> 22:00.982
Did you enjoy your food?

22:01.025 --> 22:03.926
Yes, I did. It was wonderful. Thank you.

22:04.996 --> 22:06.860
Is something wrong?

22:08.465 --> 22:12.594
No. No. Would you excuse me
for just a second?

22:13.902 --> 22:17.598
No, no! Don't get up.
Please, don't do that. Thank you.

22:22.976 --> 22:24.443
I'm having a crisis.

22:24.478 --> 22:27.446
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Well, I'm working on my article,

22:27.480 --> 22:30.381
and I've been drinking
the most incredible champagne,

22:30.416 --> 22:31.883
and I can't enjoy it.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.147
All I'm thinking about is how much
Claudio and Luka spent on it.

22:35.286 --> 22:37.412
Who are Claudio and Luka?

22:37.454 --> 22:39.388
They're the guys
who are buying us dinner.

22:39.423 --> 22:43.051
And the food, Hilda,
you wouldn't even believe it.

22:43.092 --> 22:48.154
And I know we're trying to
spend $ 10,000, but I just feel so guilty.

22:48.196 --> 22:50.926
Well, are Claudio
and Luka having a good time?

22:50.999 --> 22:52.489
Yeah. I think so.

22:52.567 --> 22:56.696
And they're not expecting some sort of,
you know, "payment" for dinner?

22:56.737 --> 22:59.796
What? Oh, no! No!

22:59.839 --> 23:02.603
If they are,
then they're going to be disappointed.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.131
Well, at least one of them will.

23:04.176 --> 23:07.111
So, these two guys with money
take you out to a fabulous dinner,

23:07.146 --> 23:11.138
everybody's having a great time,
and you're feeling guilty because...

23:11.816 --> 23:12.874
I don't know.

23:12.917 --> 23:16.818
Betty, you deserve to have fun
more than anybody I know.

23:16.853 --> 23:21.551
You spend every dime you make to live
in the city, but you don't live in the city.

23:21.624 --> 23:24.057
<i>Trust me. All your problems
are going to be there tomorrow,</i>

23:24.092 --> 23:28.586
so will you please go have some fun?
Just be careful, okay?

23:29.263 --> 23:33.723
Okay. Okay, I will. Thank you, Hilda.

23:38.838 --> 23:41.533
So, where are Luka and Claudio?

23:41.573 --> 23:43.473
They had to go make
some business calls.

23:43.508 --> 23:45.566
- Oh?
- I got us another bottle.

23:45.609 --> 23:49.705
They won't mind. They're, like,
international financiers or something.

23:49.747 --> 23:54.843
You know, Amanda, I have to admit,
when Daniel teamed us up on this,

23:54.884 --> 23:58.580
I was a little upset and a lot skeptical,

23:58.654 --> 24:03.454
but everything's really turned out okay.
Thank you.

24:03.758 --> 24:05.123
To spending 10 grand.

24:05.159 --> 24:10.221
And to my roommate. If nothing else,
you make my life very interesting.

24:10.729 --> 24:12.356
Of course I do.

24:13.866 --> 24:17.096
The gentlemen said
you would take care of this.

24:17.268 --> 24:18.599
Um, what?

24:25.642 --> 24:29.304
Oh, my God.
They stuck us with the bill.

24:37.218 --> 24:38.242
They stiffed us.

24:38.319 --> 24:42.220
And I never even saw it coming.
They're good.

24:42.255 --> 24:45.383
Oh, my God.
Amanda, we can't pay this.

24:45.425 --> 24:48.325
Well, at least we hit our target number.
High five!

24:48.360 --> 24:50.521
What are we going to do?

24:50.562 --> 24:53.121
The final option, dine and dash.

24:53.164 --> 24:56.998
No! You can't just walk out on the bill.
That's illegal.

24:57.034 --> 24:58.591
- Is it?
- Yes.

24:58.635 --> 25:01.263
- Is it really?
- Yes! Stop doing that!

25:01.304 --> 25:03.794
All right, I got to think.
Got to think. Think, Betty, think.

25:03.873 --> 25:06.706
There's got to be something I can do.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.278
Whenever you're ready.

25:12.213 --> 25:13.804
Oh, excuse me?

25:15.249 --> 25:17.547
Can I talk to your manager?

25:22.221 --> 25:24.154
I got your message.
You got a check for me?

25:24.189 --> 25:26.419
Uh, yeah. Uh, right here.

25:26.458 --> 25:30.086
- Is that sweet-and-sour? Can I?
- Sure, help yourself.

25:30.561 --> 25:32.927
They feed you these tiny
hors d'oeuvres at this thing.

25:32.963 --> 25:34.395
I always end up starved.

25:34.430 --> 25:36.295
So, here you go. I just...

25:36.366 --> 25:39.027
I feel really terrible
about canceling on you tonight.

25:39.101 --> 25:40.193
Mmm-hmm.

25:40.269 --> 25:41.634
Honestly.

25:41.904 --> 25:44.098
- Really terrible?
- Really terrible.

25:44.138 --> 25:47.198
- Write me a bigger check.
- What?

25:47.675 --> 25:49.972
I find a little guilt is always good

25:50.010 --> 25:53.241
for squeezing a little extra cash
out of you rich jerks.

25:53.280 --> 25:57.773
- There's a fork here if you need it.
- Please. I'm a master with these things.

25:59.018 --> 26:00.450
Damn.

26:00.552 --> 26:04.044
There is no shame in using a fork.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.785
At least you have time to go home
and change.

26:06.823 --> 26:09.257
- No, forget it.
- Are you kidding?

26:09.293 --> 26:10.554
I'm a kindergarten teacher.

26:10.626 --> 26:14.062
I'm always covered in paint,
paste and puke anyway.

26:14.630 --> 26:17.097
- Come on.
- What?

26:17.165 --> 26:20.463
Come with me. I'm not letting you
go out looking like that.

26:20.901 --> 26:22.698
Is there a problem?

26:22.736 --> 26:25.499
No. Actually, quite the contrary.

26:25.538 --> 26:28.769
<i>I'm Betty Suarez, Mode magazine.</i>

26:28.808 --> 26:31.105
This is my colleague,
Amanda Tanen Sommers.

26:31.143 --> 26:32.201
Hi.

26:32.244 --> 26:34.303
We're doing a profile
on your restaurant

26:34.346 --> 26:36.643
for our new website, modeny. com.

26:36.681 --> 26:39.115
<i>Really? You work at Mode?</i>

26:39.150 --> 26:41.982
She's in disguise.
It helps us keep a low profile.

26:42.018 --> 26:45.977
Anyway, modeny. com
is dedicated to celebrating

26:46.056 --> 26:50.389
the most hip, edgy, ahead-of-the-curve
things in New York City,

26:50.426 --> 26:53.724
and we'll be featuring you prominently
this month.

27:13.010 --> 27:15.376
Why don't I take care of this?

27:18.615 --> 27:19.809
Oh, my God.

27:20.049 --> 27:22.210
I can't believe
you pulled that off.

27:22.285 --> 27:25.082
I know! Me, neither! Oh gosh.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.815
We are going to promote
the heck out of them in our article.

27:27.855 --> 27:32.053
Whatevs. The point is,
you kicked ass, Betty Suarez!

27:32.093 --> 27:34.356
I kind of did. I'm tired.
Can we go home?

27:34.394 --> 27:38.921
Yeah. We might as well. We can't
top that. Wait. Wait, that's weird.

27:38.964 --> 27:40.522
What?

27:40.566 --> 27:44.092
Nothing. I can't find my wallet.
I think those guys stole my wallet.

27:44.135 --> 27:47.400
No! Those jerks! What?
Should I call the police?

27:49.373 --> 27:51.841
- There's one more thing.
- What?

27:51.875 --> 27:54.934
You know how you hate paying the
landlord because he creeps you out?

27:55.011 --> 27:56.000
Uh-huh.

27:56.112 --> 27:58.205
And this morning, I felt bad
because I didn't have my half.

27:58.247 --> 28:00.214
So, I thought I would just do you a favor
and drop it off.

28:00.248 --> 28:02.307
- What are you saying?
- And then Daniel gave this assignment,

28:02.350 --> 28:03.578
- and I never had time to...
- Amanda.

28:03.618 --> 28:06.484
The rent was in my purse,
and it's gone.

28:07.087 --> 28:10.749
No. No, no. It's got to be in there.
Check again.

28:12.225 --> 28:17.719
Oh, my God. It's not in there.
Oh, my God.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.063
That was everything I had.

28:21.098 --> 28:22.429
Well, we'll just go to an ATM.

28:22.466 --> 28:27.493
No, you don't understand.
That was all I had. That was everything.

28:27.570 --> 28:29.333
I can't pay my rent this month.

28:29.372 --> 28:31.931
We'll pay the rent next month.
What are they gonna do, kick us out?

28:31.974 --> 28:34.534
Yes. Yes, Amanda.

28:34.576 --> 28:36.634
That's what happens
when you don't pay the rent.

28:36.678 --> 28:40.169
What planet do you live on?
I knew this was a bad idea.

28:40.213 --> 28:43.011
Wait, this wasn't all my idea, partner.

28:43.483 --> 28:46.679
It's not just tonight, Amanda.
It's everything.

28:46.719 --> 28:50.450
You really don't take responsibility
for anything, do you?

28:51.456 --> 28:53.083
Not when you run up my bills

28:53.124 --> 28:55.956
or let your dog pee on my clothes
or eat all my food.

28:55.993 --> 28:59.190
- That was Bad Ronald.
- There is no Bad Ronald!

28:59.897 --> 29:02.364
It's you! Bad Amanda!

29:09.671 --> 29:11.195
Wait, Betty.

29:30.288 --> 29:34.724
Now I'm going to lose my apartment.
I'm going to be homeless.

29:34.791 --> 29:36.952
You'll always have a home here.

29:36.993 --> 29:38.823
I know. I just...

29:38.861 --> 29:40.624
I don't know how I let myself get sucked

29:40.663 --> 29:45.827
into Amanda's black hole
of irresponsibility. So stupid.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.324
Don't be so hard on yourself or her.

29:51.205 --> 29:52.899
She didn't mean for the money
to be stolen.

29:52.939 --> 29:55.464
Of course she didn't mean
for the money to get stolen.

29:55.508 --> 29:57.840
It's just typical Amanda.

29:57.876 --> 29:59.366
She doesn't care about anything,

29:59.411 --> 30:01.311
'cause she's never had
to work hard for anything.

30:01.346 --> 30:03.404
She thinks life
is one big night on the town.

30:03.481 --> 30:05.881
But it's not. Life is hard.

30:05.916 --> 30:09.681
Betty, your mother and I worked
very hard to raise you

30:09.719 --> 30:11.414
to be responsible.

30:11.755 --> 30:14.552
Sometimes I think
we did too good a job.

30:15.991 --> 30:17.288
What do you mean?

30:17.326 --> 30:20.089
Sweetie, I know you're angry
at Amanda,

30:21.562 --> 30:25.327
but I think there's something
that you can learn from her.

30:29.168 --> 30:31.636
Let me make you something to go.

30:43.881 --> 30:47.213
I was thinking
about naming him Abelard.

30:47.250 --> 30:50.013
Oh, my God, I hope you're joking.

30:50.051 --> 30:52.679
Well, what would you suggest?

30:52.721 --> 30:57.020
- I've always been quite fond of Hamish.
- Lovely. Why not Angus?

30:57.057 --> 30:58.149
Nothing wrong with Angus.

30:58.192 --> 31:00.489
I had a lovely tussle in the hay
with an Angus once.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.092
I'm having a son.

31:06.331 --> 31:10.324
Sorry I spilled the beans.
I know you wanted to be surprised.

31:11.302 --> 31:14.760
That's not it. It's...
I just didn't want to know.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.806
It's easier to think of him as an "it"

31:16.840 --> 31:20.798
than as a little boy or girl
whose life I can screw up,

31:20.843 --> 31:22.970
like I did my daughter's.

31:23.012 --> 31:24.741
Well, hey,
you've been given another chance.

31:24.780 --> 31:30.012
Just don't do anything stupid
like naming him Abelard.

31:37.757 --> 31:40.317
Daniel. A size six?

31:42.060 --> 31:44.688
All right. All right, not a problem.

31:44.763 --> 31:47.424
Well, just look on the rack on the right.

31:47.498 --> 31:49.295
Okay? Bye.

31:51.302 --> 31:53.098
What was that about?

31:53.136 --> 31:56.162
Uh, Daniel just wanted
to get into the Closet.

31:57.105 --> 32:00.404
- Well, Daniel is not a size six.
- No, he's not.

32:00.442 --> 32:02.739
Had to get a dress
for Connor's fiancée, Molly.

32:02.777 --> 32:05.507
She's going to some charity do.

32:05.546 --> 32:08.810
- And Daniel is helping her?
- I guess so.

32:11.418 --> 32:13.009
Interesting.

32:14.687 --> 32:17.155
- Take your pick.
- Seriously?

32:18.323 --> 32:21.850
- What are you, my fairy godmother?
- No. Just the boss.

32:23.393 --> 32:24.860
Oh, my God.

32:26.964 --> 32:28.760
What do you think?

32:29.499 --> 32:31.831
I think you have good taste.

32:32.835 --> 32:34.495
Turn around.

32:39.573 --> 32:42.406
Just don't let the paparazzi
take photos of you in that dress.

32:42.443 --> 32:45.206
That's supposed to be our March cover.

32:46.179 --> 32:49.443
Do I even want to know
how much this thing costs?

32:50.282 --> 32:53.979
Depends. You planning
on using chopsticks tonight?

32:54.752 --> 32:56.481
Forget I asked.

33:05.928 --> 33:07.190
Okay.

33:12.066 --> 33:13.897
What do you think?

33:15.402 --> 33:17.097
Uh, that works.

33:17.304 --> 33:21.034
It's not too much?
I don't usually wear things like this.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.741
No, it's... It's amazing.

33:25.777 --> 33:29.213
- Oh! Can you...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:55.335 --> 33:57.234
I need to go.

33:59.772 --> 34:01.830
Thank you for the dress.

35:31.112 --> 35:34.138
What if the restaurant manager
hadn't comped your meal?

35:34.181 --> 35:36.478
Then I guess she would've realized
I was trying to pay

35:36.549 --> 35:39.177
with my Queens College student ID.

35:42.254 --> 35:46.451
It's great, Betty. It's exactly the kind
of piece we need for the website.

35:46.491 --> 35:47.651
Really?

35:47.692 --> 35:48.886
People are going to eat that up.

35:48.926 --> 35:51.758
It's so much more
than just a list of things to do.

35:51.795 --> 35:55.525
It's got a moral. It goes a lot deeper.
You guys seem like you had a blast.

35:55.564 --> 36:00.592
We did. We did,
in a sleazy, scammy sort of way.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.660
I guess I have Amanda to thank for that.

36:02.704 --> 36:05.298
So, I guess you wouldn't mind
working with her again.

36:05.340 --> 36:08.638
Oh. Um, I don't know about that.

36:08.676 --> 36:10.871
Because I've got to tell you,
this story is going to make

36:10.944 --> 36:13.605
an excellent regular feature
on our website.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.614
- Seriously?
- Sure. Think about it.

36:15.648 --> 36:18.172
You and Amanda
out on the town every week,

36:18.250 --> 36:21.219
having some new kind
of crazy adventure.

36:21.253 --> 36:22.844
I mean, you have a great dynamic.

36:22.887 --> 36:25.856
The budget's pretty tight, but
I could probably float you an advance

36:25.890 --> 36:28.414
if it sweetens the deal
and helps pay your rent.

36:28.458 --> 36:32.553
It would. It would!
Oh, God. Thank you, Daniel.

36:32.594 --> 36:37.257
You know, you should have fun.
Just make sure to stay out of trouble.

36:38.199 --> 36:39.530
Got it.

36:40.368 --> 36:44.736
On second thought, I guess
a little trouble's not too bad, huh?

37:19.933 --> 37:21.525
Where's Amanda?

37:21.601 --> 37:24.296
I don't know. She left early.
I'm just covering the phones.

37:24.336 --> 37:25.428
Oh.

37:27.473 --> 37:29.099
- Amanda!
- Got to go, Betty!

37:29.140 --> 37:32.075
- Amanda! I have to talk to you.
- Sorry, I have no time.

37:32.110 --> 37:33.236
- What?
- Oh, my God.

37:33.277 --> 37:36.336
- Why are you in such a rush?
- Let go! Let go!

37:42.618 --> 37:44.448
No! Give it back!

37:45.253 --> 37:47.187
What are you wearing?

37:48.423 --> 37:50.754
Don't look at me! I'm a freak!

37:51.258 --> 37:53.522
Amanda, you got a second job?

37:57.130 --> 38:00.826
Betty, last night wasn't all your fault.

38:00.866 --> 38:03.596
Well, it was a little bit your fault,

38:03.635 --> 38:06.831
but it was mostly my fault. I don't know.

38:06.871 --> 38:09.669
I would say it was more like 70-40 me.

38:10.640 --> 38:12.505
The thing is, you're right.

38:12.542 --> 38:15.874
I should care more
about what's important to you,

38:18.447 --> 38:20.971
like paying my half of the rent.

38:22.350 --> 38:23.840
I got to go.

38:24.185 --> 38:25.652
I had fun.

38:26.486 --> 38:28.920
- What?
- Last night, I had fun.

38:29.489 --> 38:32.855
I've been working so hard to pay
for my fabulous single life

38:32.892 --> 38:34.484
in Manhattan,

38:34.527 --> 38:36.619
I haven't really lived it,

38:36.661 --> 38:40.222
until you forced me to go out last night
and have fun.

38:40.265 --> 38:43.199
And I did. So thank you.

38:44.501 --> 38:47.697
Sure. I had fun, too.

38:50.072 --> 38:52.039
So, that happened.

38:53.341 --> 38:55.935
By the way, Daniel loved our article,

38:55.977 --> 38:58.137
so there's a little extra cash in it,

38:58.212 --> 39:00.510
and we're not going to
lose our apartment.

39:00.614 --> 39:03.582
- So I can quit my job in clown hell?
- No.

39:09.488 --> 39:13.253
You do not want to know
what I had to do to get this.

39:13.291 --> 39:14.383
Okay, I'll tell you!

39:14.425 --> 39:17.223
- No. No.
- But I had a really good quip.

39:20.030 --> 39:23.396
Damn. I was hoping for some skin,
you know, from Daniel.

39:23.432 --> 39:26.595
No, this is better
than I could ever have imagined.

39:26.635 --> 39:28.192
But you don't even have them
doing the nasty.

39:28.703 --> 39:30.728
No. Stop it. Freeze.

39:31.206 --> 39:33.174
You see the way
Daniel's looking at her?

39:33.240 --> 39:35.105
The way Betty looks at a cheeseburger.

39:35.142 --> 39:36.666
I've been looking for the wedge to drive

39:36.743 --> 39:39.472
between Connor
and that sweet little schoolmarm,

39:39.512 --> 39:43.709
and Daniel has just given it to me.
He's falling in love with her,

39:44.249 --> 39:46.444
and I'm back in the game.

40:09.036 --> 40:11.094
What's all this business?

40:12.339 --> 40:15.466
Well, I figured after
a long day of hard work,

40:15.507 --> 40:18.442
you might be tired and a little hungry.

40:20.745 --> 40:22.212
Oh, also...

40:25.883 --> 40:28.579
A gift? For me?

40:32.855 --> 40:36.051
You know, 'cause yours got stolen

40:36.091 --> 40:39.322
and you need somewhere
to keep your rent money.

40:40.061 --> 40:42.221
Betty, this is Prada.

40:42.296 --> 40:44.628
Actually, it's Plada.

40:48.368 --> 40:49.858
Thank you.

40:53.972 --> 40:55.906
- Can we eat?
- Yes.

40:57.608 --> 41:00.475
- How was work?
- Well, it was terrible.
