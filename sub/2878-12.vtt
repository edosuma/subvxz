WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.294
Completely empty box.

00:04.295 --> 00:05.561
If you'd like to examine it...

00:05.563 --> 00:06.896
Mm-hmm. Yep.

00:06.898 --> 00:10.983
I see nothing in this box
but a wasted childhood.

00:10.985 --> 00:14.270
Little snarky there,
Cello Lessons.

00:15.655 --> 00:19.942
And we have this completely
ordinary cylinder.

00:19.944 --> 00:21.327
If you'd like to examine it...

00:21.329 --> 00:26.615
Ordinary, yet I sense it is
dripping with magical potential.

00:26.617 --> 00:29.151
Oh, dear Lord.

00:29.153 --> 00:32.621
A man pops out for a moment
to evacuate his bowels

00:32.622 --> 00:35.657
and catch up on the adventures
of the Caped Crusader,

00:35.659 --> 00:37.643
only to emerge
and discover his apartment

00:37.645 --> 00:40.429
has been transformed
into a cabaret.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.448
Sheldon, he's just

00:42.450 --> 00:44.383
practicing for his
cousin's birthday party.

00:44.385 --> 00:46.218
As I was saying...

00:46.220 --> 00:48.137
empty box, empty cylinder,

00:48.139 --> 00:49.939
and... ooh!

00:49.941 --> 00:52.024
Voila.

00:52.026 --> 00:53.976
I'm telling you, dude,
there's a seat

00:53.978 --> 00:57.313
on the Hogwarts Express
with your name on it.

00:57.315 --> 00:59.031
This is how you're
going to entertain

00:59.033 --> 01:00.682
your little cousin
and his friends?

01:00.684 --> 01:01.951
By lying to them?

01:01.953 --> 01:03.986
How is this lying?

01:03.988 --> 01:06.572
A magic show is an inherently
deceitful proposition.

01:06.574 --> 01:09.625
"This is an ordinary top hat."

01:09.627 --> 01:10.960
"You've chosen
that card freely."

01:10.962 --> 01:14.964
"I do not have a set of lock
picks lodged in my keister."

01:14.966 --> 01:16.298
Can't you

01:16.300 --> 01:17.550
just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon?

01:17.552 --> 01:19.201
Why must you
peek behind the curtain?

01:19.203 --> 01:21.036
Or up the butt?

01:21.038 --> 01:24.206
If we poison the critical
thinking faculties of children

01:24.208 --> 01:25.724
by telling them that rabbits

01:25.726 --> 01:28.894
come out of hats,
then we create adults

01:28.896 --> 01:31.013
who believe in astrology
and homeopathy

01:31.015 --> 01:34.350
and that Ryan Reynolds was a
better choice for <i>Green Lantern</i>

01:34.352 --> 01:36.852
than lovable rogue
Nathan Fillion.

01:36.854 --> 01:38.854
Sheldon,

01:38.856 --> 01:41.290
he's just gonna do a few
magic tricks for some kids.

01:41.292 --> 01:42.891
I really don't think
they're gonna end up

01:42.893 --> 01:45.411
liking the <i>Green Lantern</i> movie.

01:45.413 --> 01:46.862
Don't be so
hard on him.

01:46.864 --> 01:48.781
It's natural to be
a little cranky when you have...

01:48.783 --> 01:52.167
a quarter
in your ear!

01:54.070 --> 01:57.089
Coins lodged in body parts
is not a source of amusement.

01:57.091 --> 02:01.176
When I was five, Billy Sparks
put a Mexican peso up my nose.

02:02.380 --> 02:05.164
Wait-wait-wait,
how is that not amusing?

02:05.166 --> 02:06.999
It's still there.

02:07.884 --> 02:09.084
Takes me

02:09.086 --> 02:12.187
45 minutes to get
through airport security.

02:14.391 --> 02:17.943
Look, I made
Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.

02:17.945 --> 02:21.397
Next time, you should
open with that.

Original Air Date on January 12, 2012

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

02:47.414 --> 02:49.347
Ooh, look who's out on a date.

02:49.348 --> 02:53.117
Pasadena's favorite
power couple, Shamy.

02:53.119 --> 02:55.202
And that is the answer
to the question,

02:55.204 --> 02:57.838
what is wrong with eating
at The Cheesecake Factory?

02:57.840 --> 03:00.691
So, are we celebrating
anything special tonight?

03:00.693 --> 03:01.909
Oh, yes.

03:01.911 --> 03:03.694
Our relationship
agreement specifies

03:03.696 --> 03:05.496
that the second Thursday
of every month,

03:05.498 --> 03:08.049
or the third Thursday
in a month with five Thursdays,

03:08.051 --> 03:09.583
is date night.

03:13.037 --> 03:15.890
That is so hot.

03:17.225 --> 03:21.595
All right, without objection,
the minutes of the previous date

03:21.597 --> 03:23.981
are considered
read and agreed to.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.734
Any new business?

03:26.736 --> 03:28.319
How was your day?

03:28.321 --> 03:29.236
Superb.

03:29.238 --> 03:31.739
This morning I made
a palindrome

03:31.741 --> 03:32.957
with my Alpha-Bits.

03:32.959 --> 03:36.026
"Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."

03:36.995 --> 03:39.730
Sounds like you
hit the ground running.

03:39.732 --> 03:42.500
I have a bit of
good news myself.

03:42.502 --> 03:43.934
My most recent paper

03:43.936 --> 03:46.420
on how a cooperative
long-term potentiation

03:46.422 --> 03:48.456
can map memory sequences
in dendritic branches

03:48.458 --> 03:50.708
made the cover of <i>Neuron.</i>

03:50.710 --> 03:52.910
Ooh! Speaking of good news,

03:52.912 --> 03:54.095
somebody...

03:54.097 --> 03:57.214
just hit 100
Twitter followers.

03:57.216 --> 03:59.433
That's nice.

03:59.435 --> 04:01.051
Anyway, I've been
dreaming of this day

04:01.053 --> 04:02.636
for a long time.
Yeah, me, too.

04:02.638 --> 04:04.522
Triple digits,
I'm not gonna lie--

04:04.524 --> 04:06.056
it feels pretty good.

04:06.058 --> 04:07.758
Sheldon,

04:07.760 --> 04:09.944
I'm the sole author
on a paper being published

04:09.946 --> 04:11.729
in a distinguished journal
that may change

04:11.731 --> 04:13.063
the course of my field.

04:13.065 --> 04:14.215
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:14.217 --> 04:15.983
Ooh, 101!

04:15.985 --> 04:19.069
Air's getting
a bit thin up here.

04:20.238 --> 04:22.456
So, are we ready to order?

04:22.458 --> 04:23.707
Give me a minute.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.476
I'm gonna go wash up.

04:26.878 --> 04:28.829
Well, that's odd.

04:28.831 --> 04:31.298
We both washed up
when we came in.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.117
It's probably a euphemism
for urination.

04:34.119 --> 04:36.470
Sheldon, what is
wrong with you?

04:36.472 --> 04:39.640
Not much. Although,
I can be faulted

04:39.642 --> 04:41.959
for being overly fond
of koala bears.

04:41.961 --> 04:43.561
I don't know what it is,

04:43.563 --> 04:45.513
when they smart munching
on eucalyptus,

04:45.515 --> 04:47.898
I just melt inside.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.800
Okay, Amy just told you
some exciting news,

04:49.802 --> 04:52.019
and you acted like
it was no big deal.

04:52.021 --> 04:53.771
Oh, I see why you're confused.

04:53.773 --> 04:56.640
No, her news sounded important,
but what you're forgetting is,

04:56.642 --> 04:59.410
it was an achievement
in the field of biology.

04:59.412 --> 05:03.514
That's all about yucky,
squishy things.

05:03.516 --> 05:06.000
Honey, she's upset.
You're her boyfriend.

05:06.002 --> 05:08.485
You have to at least
try to be excited

05:08.487 --> 05:10.254
by the things
she's excited by.

05:10.256 --> 05:12.806
What if they simply
don't excite me?

05:12.808 --> 05:16.093
Well, just smile and
think about koalas.

05:16.095 --> 05:17.428
She'd see right through that.

05:17.430 --> 05:19.496
We go to the zoo all the time.

05:19.498 --> 05:21.348
She knows my koala face.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.436
And for future reference,
it's this.

05:29.941 --> 05:32.142
Oh, you have a lot
of magic stuff.

05:32.144 --> 05:33.611
Yeah.

05:33.613 --> 05:35.178
I started when I was a teenager.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.531
I thought I could show
a girl a few tricks

05:37.533 --> 05:41.068
and invite her up to my bedroom
to see the rest of the act.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.787
Did it work?

05:43.789 --> 05:45.990
Ah, let's just say the only wand

05:45.992 --> 05:49.877
that ever saw any action
was this one.

05:51.796 --> 05:55.616
Oh, look what my mom
made us for the act.

05:55.618 --> 05:56.884
Ooh...

05:56.886 --> 05:58.802
I like the fabric.

05:58.804 --> 06:00.170
Where'd she get it?

06:00.172 --> 06:04.058
Well, she cut up one
of her old bathing suits.

06:05.209 --> 06:09.063
She made these two vests
and half a dozen napkins.

06:10.148 --> 06:13.717
Has she
tried on the vest yet?!

06:13.719 --> 06:14.718
I just gave it to her!

06:14.720 --> 06:18.072
I hope it fits-- she
has a tricky figure!

06:18.074 --> 06:22.860
She's short
and stacked, like me!

06:22.862 --> 06:26.864
She's not stacked like you, Ma!
She never steps on hers!

06:30.418 --> 06:33.337
Listen, Howie,
maybe I'm not the best choice

06:33.339 --> 06:34.955
to be a magician's assistant.

06:34.957 --> 06:37.258
You'll do fine.
Hand me those rings?

06:38.677 --> 06:41.078
See? You nailed it.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.379
You know, i-it's just that

06:42.381 --> 06:44.298
I'm not that comfortable
with little kids.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.383
Well, that's because you
haven't been around them much.

06:46.385 --> 06:48.135
This is good
practice. I mean,

06:48.137 --> 06:50.854
you are gonna be
a mom someday, right?

06:50.856 --> 06:51.939
Mmm...

06:51.941 --> 06:54.257
Yeah, sure.
Oh-ho-ho!

06:54.259 --> 06:58.929
I haven't seen
this trick in years.

06:58.931 --> 07:00.447
It's called
the dove pan.

07:00.449 --> 07:02.783
You let everyone see
the pan is empty,

07:02.785 --> 07:06.403
but there's a secret
compartment in the lid.

07:06.405 --> 07:09.990
And then you open it
and produce a live...

07:11.000 --> 07:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:19.501 --> 07:22.803
Don't look in there.

07:27.008 --> 07:29.626
Oh, a little Red
Dead Redemption, huh?

07:29.628 --> 07:31.895
Yes.

07:31.897 --> 07:33.397
How come you're not
doing a mission?

07:33.399 --> 07:34.565
You're just
wandering around.

07:34.567 --> 07:36.317
Had a rough night.

07:36.319 --> 07:39.987
I thought I'd go for a walk
and clear my head.

07:41.773 --> 07:45.442
Some people go outside
and do that.

07:45.444 --> 07:48.996
It's after 9:00-- at this hour
the streets of Pasadena

07:48.998 --> 07:53.083
are teeming with drunken sailors
and alley cats.

07:53.085 --> 07:54.918
You want to talk about it?

07:54.920 --> 07:56.036
No.

07:56.038 --> 07:58.222
I think I'll just go
in this saloon

07:58.224 --> 08:00.824
and drink my troubles away.

08:05.597 --> 08:09.833
You know digital
alcohol is never a solution.

08:09.835 --> 08:11.935
What's going on?

08:13.272 --> 08:15.356
Hard as this may be to believe,

08:15.358 --> 08:19.360
it's possible that
I'm not boyfriend material.

08:22.781 --> 08:26.183
Glad I was sitting down
for that.

08:26.185 --> 08:28.202
Did you and Amy get in a fight?

08:28.204 --> 08:32.188
Amy had a fight; I was being
perfectly reasonable.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.241
I'm gonna have a whiskey.

08:34.243 --> 08:35.325
Do you want anything?

08:35.327 --> 08:37.644
No, I can't.

08:37.645 --> 08:40.530
I'm playing Grand
Theft Auto later.

08:45.503 --> 08:48.055
Look, I'm no expert in women...

08:48.057 --> 08:48.922
I'll say.

08:50.275 --> 08:53.060
That's not necessary when
someone's trying to help you.

08:53.062 --> 08:55.312
I'm sorry.
It's the alcohol talking.

08:55.314 --> 08:57.614
Go on.

08:58.850 --> 09:03.220
Sometimes with women you want
to listen to what upsets them

09:03.222 --> 09:08.358
and then show them
that you can grow and change.

09:08.360 --> 09:14.731
Nuts to that.
What else you got?

09:14.733 --> 09:15.949
Buy her something.

09:15.951 --> 09:19.670
How does that work?

09:19.672 --> 09:23.457
Well, you skip over
any attempt to repair

09:23.459 --> 09:26.510
your emotional connection
and you win back her affection

09:26.512 --> 09:30.080
with an empty financial gesture.

09:30.082 --> 09:34.902
Well, that approach has Sheldon
Cooper written all over it.

09:35.937 --> 09:37.921
Glad I could help.

09:37.923 --> 09:39.589
It's appreciated.
And if you ever manage

09:39.591 --> 09:42.643
to find a woman again, I'll
be glad to return the favor.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.649
And now, all
the rings are

09:48.651 --> 09:51.034
magically linked together.

09:52.303 --> 09:55.873
My fiancée's wearing
a magic ring, too.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.392
It made all my money disappear.

10:01.112 --> 10:03.280
Oh, ah, right.

10:06.835 --> 10:09.119
And now, the
great Howdini's

10:09.121 --> 10:12.639
next miraculous
illusion.

10:12.641 --> 10:14.641
When are we gonna have cake?

10:14.643 --> 10:19.763
After you've
been thoroughly amazed.

10:19.765 --> 10:21.932
But we want cake now.

10:21.934 --> 10:25.402
Well, you're not getting cake
right now, <i>capisce?</i>

10:26.488 --> 10:30.607
Okay. Okay.

10:30.609 --> 10:34.361
Now, my lovely assistant
is going to bring me

10:34.363 --> 10:36.363
an ordinary
pitcher of milk.

10:36.365 --> 10:38.165
I know how you do that trick.

10:38.167 --> 10:40.117
Do you know how to pipe down?

10:41.252 --> 10:43.504
Okay, we're going

10:43.506 --> 10:46.757
to roll up
this newspaper.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.008
It's a fake pitcher.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.676
You got wax in your ears?

10:49.678 --> 10:52.296
The man said
it's an ordinary pitcher.

10:52.964 --> 10:55.165
Howdini.

10:55.167 --> 11:00.187
Okay, we're going
to stick this in here.

11:00.189 --> 11:03.006
And then I'm going
to pour in the milk.

11:03.008 --> 11:05.142
I hope this works,

11:05.144 --> 11:07.211
because I didn't
bring a change of pants.

11:07.862 --> 11:09.780
Look, I Googled it.

11:09.782 --> 11:11.882
It's a fake pitcher.

11:13.117 --> 11:14.952
That's it.

11:14.954 --> 11:16.236
No cake for you.

11:16.238 --> 11:18.822
Anyone else want to
join the No Cake Club?

11:19.857 --> 11:22.042
She's just kidding,
boys and girls.

11:22.044 --> 11:23.410
Everyone gets cake.

11:23.412 --> 11:26.380
Not him.

11:28.082 --> 11:31.301
Just give me the pitcher.

11:32.755 --> 11:34.922
Behold!

11:47.352 --> 11:49.552
Wrong pitcher.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.141
I told you I'm not
good with kids.

11:57.142 --> 11:58.608
Yes, you did.

11:58.610 --> 12:01.862
Oh, I think my crotch
is starting to curdle.

12:02.830 --> 12:06.166
The thing is, my mother
worked full-time.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.785
I had to take care of
my brothers and sisters.

12:08.787 --> 12:10.454
Yeah, so?

12:10.456 --> 12:12.039
Ugh, it was horrible!

12:12.041 --> 12:14.675
With their snotty noses
and their poopy diapers

12:14.677 --> 12:17.294
and their little shrieky voices,
always complaining.

12:17.296 --> 12:18.762
"I don't want to get dressed."

12:18.764 --> 12:20.497
"Joey keeps spitting
in my mouth."

12:20.499 --> 12:22.516
"This isn't the way
Mom makes waffles."

12:22.518 --> 12:24.601
Well, okay, put your
hand in here.

12:24.603 --> 12:27.170
Let's see how you
like this waffle!

12:27.172 --> 12:30.340
All right, settle down.

12:30.342 --> 12:31.558
Red light.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.510
Red light, red light!

12:33.512 --> 12:36.813
Okay, we're fine.

12:36.815 --> 12:38.231
I'm sorry.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.400
I know it makes me sound
like a bad person,

12:40.402 --> 12:41.985
but I just don't like children.

12:41.987 --> 12:44.154
Yeah, no, we all got that.

12:46.324 --> 12:48.325
But don't you think
it'll be different

12:48.327 --> 12:50.711
when the child is ours?

12:50.713 --> 12:53.246
Right, when it's our kid
that's ruined my body

12:53.248 --> 12:56.199
and kept me up all night and
I've got no career and no future

12:56.201 --> 12:58.552
and nothing to be happy about
for the next 20 years,

12:58.554 --> 13:01.421
sure, that'll be
completely different.

13:04.142 --> 13:06.510
Well, yeah.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.468
I don't think there's
anything in this jewelry store

13:14.470 --> 13:15.885
that Amy would appreciate more

13:15.887 --> 13:19.439
than the humidifier we were
just looking at at Sears.

13:19.441 --> 13:22.392
Oh, my God, now I know
what I sound like to you

13:22.394 --> 13:25.095
when I say stupid stuff.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.915
Ooh, a pocket watch.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.900
Okay, I don't think Amy
wants a pocket watch.

13:30.902 --> 13:34.788
No, but maybe she wants
a man with a pocket watch.

13:34.790 --> 13:38.875
Still saying stupid stuff.

13:38.877 --> 13:40.794
Ooh...

13:40.796 --> 13:41.845
Does she like bracelets?

13:41.847 --> 13:44.131
Well, she's very fond
of her silver one

13:44.133 --> 13:46.049
that says "allergic
to penicillin."

13:46.051 --> 13:49.436
Maybe they have a dressier
version of that?

13:49.438 --> 13:51.388
Well, how are we doing
this afternoon?

13:51.390 --> 13:52.856
Are we looking for
anything special?

13:52.858 --> 13:54.307
Perhaps a ring for the lady?

13:54.309 --> 13:56.610
Trust me, we are
not a couple.

13:56.612 --> 13:58.528
Excuse me.

13:58.530 --> 14:01.531
I don't see why you get to snort
derisively and point that out.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.367
You'd be lucky to land
a fella like me.

14:04.369 --> 14:05.819
Fine, go ahead.

14:05.821 --> 14:09.573
Trust me, we are
not a couple.

14:09.575 --> 14:10.624
My apologies.

14:10.626 --> 14:12.292
How can I help you today?

14:12.294 --> 14:13.660
He's in trouble
with his girlfriend

14:13.662 --> 14:15.212
and needs to
buy her a present.

14:15.214 --> 14:17.798
Great, trouble with girlfriends

14:17.800 --> 14:21.051
is what's putting
my daughter through USC.

14:23.087 --> 14:25.555
Ooh, are these real diamonds?

14:25.557 --> 14:29.059
Yes. Channel set baguettes,
20 points total weight.

14:29.061 --> 14:30.644
Remarkable.

14:30.646 --> 14:33.013
Diamonds, crystallized carbon.

14:33.015 --> 14:35.131
Every day, people go
to the grocery store

14:35.133 --> 14:37.184
and come home with
sacks full of carbon

14:37.186 --> 14:38.968
in the form of
charcoal briquettes

14:38.970 --> 14:41.571
that they toss in their
barbeques and set on fire.

14:41.573 --> 14:43.990
But just because
you've got some carbon

14:43.992 --> 14:45.992
with the atoms stacked neatly,

14:45.994 --> 14:48.662
you expect me to plunk down
thousands of dollars.

14:48.664 --> 14:50.280
Actually, that's only 750.

14:50.282 --> 14:51.531
Everything's on sale.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.734
Really. Talk to me
about that pocket watch.

14:57.205 --> 15:00.207
I'm still trying to
wrap my mind around it.

15:00.209 --> 15:01.491
I always

15:01.493 --> 15:04.377
thought I'd be a dad someday.

15:04.379 --> 15:05.662
Oh, me, too.

15:05.664 --> 15:07.097
You're so caring.

15:07.099 --> 15:10.634
I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.056
There you go, Howard.

15:16.058 --> 15:19.359
Sounds like Raj'll have
your babies; problem solved.

15:19.361 --> 15:21.478
Hey, just because a man
shows caring for another man

15:21.480 --> 15:22.779
doesn't mean he's
displaying the love

15:22.781 --> 15:25.782
that dare not speak its name.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.852
Did she definitely say
she didn't want kids?

15:29.854 --> 15:31.655
Yeah, she doesn't like them.

15:31.657 --> 15:34.991
And from what I saw,
the feeling was mutual.

15:39.997 --> 15:41.864
What are you gonna do?

15:41.866 --> 15:43.099
I don't know.

15:43.101 --> 15:45.702
I can't see a life
where I don't have kids.

15:45.704 --> 15:47.254
I mean, people have kids.

15:47.256 --> 15:52.375
I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.

15:52.377 --> 15:56.680
So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses

15:56.682 --> 16:00.617
and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.

16:00.619 --> 16:04.220
You know, there's no guarantee
even if you have kids

16:04.222 --> 16:05.906
that you're going to like them.

16:05.908 --> 16:09.025
Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?

16:09.027 --> 16:13.330
It's right off the dust jacket
of my mom's last book.

16:15.499 --> 16:19.836
Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.

16:19.838 --> 16:24.040
Look, Howard, I'd say there's
a lot of fish in the sea,

16:24.042 --> 16:27.010
but I watched you dangle your
hook in the water for years.

16:27.012 --> 16:29.646
Do not throw her back.

16:32.216 --> 16:36.353
I don't want to, but this is
kind of a deal breaker.

16:36.355 --> 16:38.521
What's your mom going to say
if you call off the wedding?

16:38.523 --> 16:39.856
Oh, it'll kill her.

16:39.858 --> 16:41.808
On the other hand, if I don't
give her grandchildren,

16:41.810 --> 16:43.226
that'll kill her, too.

16:43.228 --> 16:45.946
So, either way,
on the Mom front, I'm golden.

16:48.482 --> 16:51.067
What time did you tell
Amy to be here?

16:51.069 --> 16:52.986
8:00.

16:57.441 --> 17:00.243
Sheldon, that pocket watch
is ridiculous.

17:00.245 --> 17:01.444
Nonsense.

17:01.446 --> 17:04.146
I look like a train conductor.

17:05.967 --> 17:09.169
Under what pretext
did you lure her here?

17:09.171 --> 17:12.339
I said, "Hey, want
to come over and hang out?"

17:12.340 --> 17:14.307
Good, good, if you had
said something clever,

17:14.309 --> 17:16.509
she might've gotten suspicious.

17:17.310 --> 17:19.729
Hey.
Hi.

17:19.731 --> 17:20.963
What's he doing here?

17:20.964 --> 17:22.648
Okay, he wants
to talk to you.

17:22.651 --> 17:24.401
Well, I don't want
to talk to him.

17:24.403 --> 17:26.469
And I'm pretty
disappointed in you, too.

17:26.471 --> 17:30.073
Although we both
know that won't last.

17:30.075 --> 17:32.742
Sheldon, you're up.

17:32.744 --> 17:33.743
Thank you.

17:33.745 --> 17:36.746
Amy, I'd like to apologize.

17:36.748 --> 17:39.082
Your accomplishment
was impressive.

17:39.084 --> 17:42.252
And I'm proud of you.

17:45.056 --> 17:46.790
We both know that's
your koala face.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.041
I told you.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.628
Okay, look, he
bought you this.

17:51.630 --> 17:54.097
Jewelry?

17:54.099 --> 17:55.498
Seriously?

17:55.500 --> 17:57.384
Sheldon, you are
the most shallow,

17:57.386 --> 17:59.269
self-centered person
I have ever met.

17:59.271 --> 18:01.671
Do you really think another
transparently manipul...

18:01.673 --> 18:03.506
Oh, it's a tiara!

18:03.508 --> 18:05.174
A tiara!
I have a tiara!

18:05.176 --> 18:07.677
Put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me, put it on me,

18:07.679 --> 18:10.947
put it on me, put it
on me, put it on me.

18:13.401 --> 18:15.235
You look beautiful.

18:15.237 --> 18:17.320
Of course I do, I'm a princess,
and this is my tiara!

18:27.214 --> 18:29.883
You were right,
the tiara was too much.

18:35.911 --> 18:38.590
Howard! Bernadette's...

18:38.591 --> 18:42.426
Oh, she slipped
right by me.

18:42.428 --> 18:43.978
Here's your vest back.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.363
You should keep it.

18:45.365 --> 18:47.231
You could wear it
again sometime.

18:47.233 --> 18:48.482
Where?

18:48.484 --> 18:51.986
I don't know, hunting?

18:51.988 --> 18:53.987
Don't forget to talk to

18:54.012 --> 18:55.312
her about this <i>mishegas</i>

18:55.408 --> 18:57.491
where I don't
get grandkids!

18:59.294 --> 19:00.294
Don't worry, Ma.

19:00.296 --> 19:02.380
I will, as soon
as I can figure out a way

19:02.382 --> 19:05.082
to bring up
such a sensitive issue!

19:08.253 --> 19:10.972
I guess you talked
to your mom, huh?

19:10.974 --> 19:12.456
I was upset.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.959
My mom can be a pretty
good shoulder to cry on,

19:14.961 --> 19:18.763
if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.

19:18.765 --> 19:22.650
Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you,

19:22.652 --> 19:25.519
and I think I came up
with a solution.

19:25.521 --> 19:27.054
Really?

19:27.056 --> 19:28.573
That's great. What?

19:28.575 --> 19:32.577
Well, seeing as how I make way
more money than you anyway,

19:32.579 --> 19:35.496
what if I work and you
stay home with the kids?

19:35.498 --> 19:37.815
Me?
Yeah.

19:37.817 --> 19:39.750
You know, you'll watch <i>Barney</i>

19:39.752 --> 19:41.586
and pull Cheerios
out of their noses

19:41.588 --> 19:43.153
and go on play dates,

19:43.155 --> 19:44.922
and I'll work and
have conversations

19:44.924 --> 19:48.559
with people my own age
and enjoy my life.

19:51.263 --> 19:52.597
Yeah...

19:52.599 --> 19:55.549
Yay, so we're good.

19:55.551 --> 19:58.886
Yeah, we're good.

19:58.888 --> 20:02.139
You know, I don't know if
this counted as a fight,

20:02.141 --> 20:04.942
but how about
some make-up sex?

20:04.944 --> 20:06.277
I would love that.

20:06.279 --> 20:09.280
But what is that
behind your ear?

20:09.282 --> 20:11.015
Oh, look, it's a condom.
