01:08.659 --> 01:11.260
THAT'S 11 PIZZAS
YOU OWE ME.

01:11.261 --> 01:14.095
THAT'S 12 PIZZAS
YOU OWE ME.

01:20.033 --> 01:22.300
HA! LOOKS LIKE 13

01:22.301 --> 01:24.635
WAS YOUR UNLUCKY
NUMBER, DUDE.

01:24.636 --> 01:27.671
RAPHAEL AND MICHELANGELO
HAD A BET GOING

01:27.672 --> 01:30.539
AS TO WHO COULD BUILD
THE TALLEST STACK
OF SODA CANS.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.641
YEAH, AND I LEFT HIM
HIGH AND DRY.

01:33.642 --> 01:35.775
WELL, HIGH ANYWAY.

01:35.776 --> 01:37.910
YOU GUYS CAN
SETTLE UP LATER.

01:37.911 --> 01:40.279
IT'S TIME
FOR APRIL'S
NEWS BROADCAST.

01:42.048 --> 01:44.682
I HOPE IT'S GOOD NEWS
FOR A CHANGE.

01:44.683 --> 01:46.082
IN THIS CITY?

01:46.083 --> 01:49.217
LEADERS OF INDUSTRY
ARE THREATENING
TO LEAVE THE CITY

01:49.218 --> 01:51.352
AS THE WAVE
OF KIDNAPPINGS CONTINUE.

01:51.353 --> 01:55.222
HMM. THAT WOULD BE
MOST UNFORTUNATE.

01:55.223 --> 01:57.823
THE HEAD OF TITANICORP
WAS KIDNAPPED THIS MORNING

01:57.824 --> 01:59.991
BY MEN DRESSED
IN BUSINESS SUITS.

01:59.992 --> 02:01.793
IN BUSINESS SUITS?

02:01.794 --> 02:04.895
WELL, AT LEAST
THIS IS ONE CRIME
WE WON'T BE ACCUSED OF.

02:04.896 --> 02:06.528
AND MOMENTS AGO,

02:06.529 --> 02:09.097
THE HEAD OF GIGANTICORP
WAS SKYJACKED

02:09.098 --> 02:10.698
AND HIS HELICOPTER
SHOT DOWN

02:10.699 --> 02:13.766
BY MORE KIDNAPPERS
DRESSED AS BUSINESSMEN.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.635
WHOA, I'VE HEARD OF
HOSTILE TAKEOVERS,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.236
BUT THIS IS, LIKE,
TOO GONZO FOR ME.

02:19.237 --> 02:22.873
HMM. THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON.

02:22.874 --> 02:24.673
I WONDER IF WE
SHOULD INVESTIGATE.

02:24.674 --> 02:25.808
WHAT FOR?

02:25.809 --> 02:27.308
WE'RE NINJA
CRIME FIGHTERS,

02:27.309 --> 02:29.043
NOT BIG TIME
BUSINESSMEN.

02:29.044 --> 02:31.478
I FEAR HE IS RIGHT,
LEONARDO.

02:31.479 --> 02:33.646
IT IS SAID THAT
THE WISE BIRD

02:33.647 --> 02:35.947
DOES NOT NEST
IN ANOTHER'S TREE.

02:35.948 --> 02:38.482
BINGO! WHICH MEANS
WE'RE KEEPING OUR BEAKS

02:38.483 --> 02:39.884
OUT OF OTHERS PEOPLE'S
PROBLEMS.

02:39.885 --> 02:43.019
April: THE TOP EXECUTIVES
OF BEHEMOTH BAKING COMPANY

02:43.020 --> 02:44.887
HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED
BY KIDNAPPERS

02:44.888 --> 02:46.387
DRESSED AS BUSINESSMEN.

02:46.388 --> 02:49.188
BEHEMOTH IS THE NATION'S
LEADING SUPPLIER

02:49.189 --> 02:50.690
OF PIZZA CRUST DOUGH,

02:50.691 --> 02:53.726
AND A GLOBAL
PIZZA SHORTAGE
IS EXPECTED.

02:53.727 --> 02:56.227
OHH. DIRTY POOL!

02:56.228 --> 02:58.195
NOW THEY'RE HITTING US
WHERE WE LIVE!

02:58.196 --> 03:00.396
A PIZZA SHORTAGE?

03:00.397 --> 03:03.465
HOW WILL WE SURVIVE,
DUDES?

03:03.466 --> 03:05.633
THIS TIME THEY'VE
GONE TOO FAR.

03:05.634 --> 03:06.700
RIGHT.

03:06.701 --> 03:08.501
TURTLES
TO THE RESCUE!

03:09.903 --> 03:13.372
I KNEW THAT WOULD STIR
THEIR PATRIOTIC SPIRIT.

03:17.408 --> 03:19.374
HOW COME WE'RE
STAKING OUT A COMPANY

03:19.375 --> 03:20.576
WHERE NOTHING'S
HAPPENING?

03:20.577 --> 03:22.944
BECAUSE THE INCREDIBLY
HUGE CORPORATION

03:22.945 --> 03:25.212
IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES
THAT HASN'T BEEN HIT.

03:25.213 --> 03:27.214
WHICH MEANS
THEY'RE ABOUT DUE.

03:27.215 --> 03:28.581
JUST KEEP
YOUR EYES PEELED

03:28.582 --> 03:32.550
FOR SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING
MEN IN BUSINESS SUITS.

03:32.551 --> 03:35.586
YOU MEAN, LIKE, THOSE
SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING MEN

03:35.587 --> 03:36.886
IN BUSINESS SUITS?

03:39.222 --> 03:41.089
IT'S THEM.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.724
LET'S TEACH THESE
THREE-PIECE OUTLAWS
A LESSON.

03:44.826 --> 03:47.626
AAH!
WHOA!

03:47.627 --> 03:50.294
LOOKS TO ME LIKE
THEY COULD TEACH US
A FEW LESSONS.

03:50.295 --> 03:52.130
ALL RIGHT,
KIDNAPPERS,

03:52.131 --> 03:53.330
GOTCHA!

03:55.599 --> 03:57.700
HEY, DUDES,
NO FAIR!

03:57.701 --> 03:59.067
PUT HIM DOWN.

03:59.068 --> 04:00.935
AS YOU WISH.

04:02.604 --> 04:04.437
NICE WORK,
LEONARDO.

04:04.438 --> 04:07.239
YOU REALLY SHOWED
THOSE GUYS.

04:07.240 --> 04:08.607
HEY, DON'T KNOCK IT.

04:08.608 --> 04:09.874
I DID GET THIS.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.408
LET'S SEE WHAT'S INSIDE.

04:11.409 --> 04:13.009
I DON'T GET IT.

04:13.010 --> 04:14.610
CROOKS DRESSED
AS BUSINESSMEN

04:14.611 --> 04:16.445
USING BLASTERS
THAT LOOK LIKE

04:16.446 --> 04:18.245
SOMETHING KRANG
MIGHT'VE DREAMED UP.

04:18.247 --> 04:19.880
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.615
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE?

04:21.616 --> 04:23.750
EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

04:23.751 --> 04:26.684
CORPORATE RAIDERS
FROM DIMENSION X!

04:26.685 --> 04:28.786
"OCTOPUS, INC.

04:28.787 --> 04:30.887
OUR TENTACLES
ARE EVERYWHERE."

04:30.888 --> 04:33.621
THESE GUYS AREN'T CRIMINALS
DISGUISED AS BUSINESSMEN.

04:33.622 --> 04:36.291
THEY ACTUALLY
ARE BUSINESSMEN.

04:36.292 --> 04:38.859
AND WITH ALL
THAT FIREPOWER
THEY'RE PACKING,

04:38.860 --> 04:41.128
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
STOP THEM ALONE.

04:41.129 --> 04:43.629
WE'VE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE
AND THINK THIS OUT.

04:43.630 --> 04:45.963
AND I KNOW
JUST THE PLACE--

04:45.964 --> 04:48.165
THE RUSSIAN PIZZA ROOM.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.667
MY FAVORITE SCARFING
ESTABLISHMENT.

04:51.668 --> 04:53.634
JUST AS YOU ORDERED,
COMRADES.

04:53.635 --> 04:55.303
THE MOSCOW PIZZA SPECIAL.

04:55.304 --> 04:58.138
ONE MISERABLE SLICE?

04:58.139 --> 05:00.139
<i>FORGIVE ME,
TOVARICHES.</i>

05:00.140 --> 05:02.640
THERE'S NOT
A SCRAP OF PIZZA DOUGH
LEFT IN THE CITY.

05:02.641 --> 05:05.142
AND I THOUGHT RUSSIA
HAD SHORTAGES.

05:05.143 --> 05:08.311
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THESE
CORPORATE KIDNAPPINGS.

05:08.312 --> 05:09.478
AND NOW!

05:09.479 --> 05:12.146
OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO
GET INSIDE OCTOPUS, INC.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.481
AND FIND OUT WHY

05:13.482 --> 05:15.415
THEY'RE SNATCHING
ALL THESE BUSINESSMEN.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.749
WITH THESE ARMORED SHELLS
AND GREEN BEAKS?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.017
HEH. LOTS OF LUCK.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.885
YEAH, RAPHAEL'S RIGHT.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.620
WE NEED
A HUMAN-TYPE DUDE
FOR THIS GIG.

05:23.621 --> 05:25.389
OK, THEN.
HOW ABOUT APRIL?

05:25.390 --> 05:26.723
NO, FORGET IT.

05:26.724 --> 05:29.558
HER FACE
IS TOO WELL-KNOWN
FROM THE 11:00 NEWS.

05:29.559 --> 05:32.159
HEY, I GOT IT,
COMPADRES!

05:32.160 --> 05:34.327
CASEY JONES!

05:34.328 --> 05:35.995
OH, YOU MEAN
THAT NUTBALL

05:35.996 --> 05:37.429
WHO THINKS HE'S
A CRIME FIGHTER?

05:37.430 --> 05:38.797
I HATE TO SAY IT,

05:38.798 --> 05:40.998
BUT CASEY LOOKS LIKE
OUR ONLY HOPE.

05:40.999 --> 05:44.268
OH, BOY.
ARE WE IN TROUBLE.

05:44.269 --> 05:46.602
HELLO,
CLASSIFIED SECTION?

05:46.603 --> 05:48.170
I'D LIKE
TO PLACE AN AD.

05:48.171 --> 05:50.505
"ATTENTION CASEY JONES,

05:50.506 --> 05:52.806
"TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT,
I'M GOING TO ROB

05:52.807 --> 05:54.841
"THE CANDY MACHINE
IN THE PARK.

05:54.842 --> 05:56.541
JUST TRY AND STOP ME."

05:56.542 --> 05:58.543
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'LL GET HIS ATTENTION?

05:58.544 --> 06:00.178
YOU'LL SEE.

06:00.179 --> 06:02.712
JUST ACT LIKE YOU'RE
TRYING TO BREAK OPEN
THE CANDY MACHINE.

06:02.713 --> 06:05.214
UNH! WITH PLEASURE.

06:05.215 --> 06:06.748
THIS THING JUST
ATE MY QUARTER!

06:11.219 --> 06:12.718
FILTHY LAWBREAKER!

06:12.719 --> 06:15.820
UNHAND THAT
VENDING MACHINE.

06:15.821 --> 06:17.722
CASEY, NO! WAIT!

06:19.791 --> 06:21.323
LOW-LIFE VERMIN,

06:21.324 --> 06:23.459
TAKE THIS!

06:23.460 --> 06:24.626
MOVE IT!
WHOA!

06:26.129 --> 06:28.128
I'LL TEACH
YOU CRIMINALS

06:28.129 --> 06:30.964
NOT TO DESECRATE
OUR FAIR PLAYGROUNDS.

06:30.965 --> 06:32.865
MELLOW OUT, C.J.

06:32.866 --> 06:33.999
IT'S US!

06:36.568 --> 06:38.201
DON'T YOU REMEMBER US?

06:38.202 --> 06:39.736
WE'RE THE TURTLES!

06:39.737 --> 06:40.969
UGH!

06:40.970 --> 06:43.171
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WERE CRIMINALS.

06:43.172 --> 06:44.606
HYAH!

06:44.607 --> 06:46.473
US?

06:46.474 --> 06:48.342
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
GUILTY OF ASSAULT

06:48.343 --> 06:49.942
WITH A DEADLY HIPPO,
PAL.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.543
WE NEED YOU
TO GO UNDERCOVER

06:51.544 --> 06:53.211
IN THE OCTOPUS, INC.
BUILDING.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.645
WE'VE DISCOVERED
THEY'RE BEHIND

06:54.646 --> 06:56.280
ALL THESE
CORPORATE KIDNAPPINGS.

06:56.281 --> 06:57.813
OOH!

06:57.814 --> 06:59.448
THOSE ARE
THE BIGGEST CRIMES

06:59.449 --> 07:00.950
IN THE CITY
RIGHT NOW.

07:00.951 --> 07:03.284
EXACTAMUNDO, DUDE.

07:03.285 --> 07:05.686
AND ONLY YOU
CAN HELP STOP THEM.

07:05.687 --> 07:08.855
HMM, SINCE YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY...

07:16.226 --> 07:19.328
I'M SEEKING
EMPLOYMENT.

07:19.329 --> 07:22.129
Leonardo: WHAT ARE
THEY DOING TO CASEY?

07:22.130 --> 07:24.131
THEY'RE ACCESSING
HIS JOB HISTORY.

07:24.132 --> 07:26.566
NOW TO FEED THEM
THE PHONY DATA.

07:26.567 --> 07:28.066
WELL NOW,
YOU DO HAVE

07:28.067 --> 07:30.234
QUITE AN INTERESTING
EMPLOYMENT RECORD,

07:30.235 --> 07:31.402
MISTER...

07:31.403 --> 07:34.371
JONES. CASEY JONES.

07:34.372 --> 07:37.072
YES, BUT I WONDER
IF YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT

07:37.073 --> 07:38.773
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.

07:38.774 --> 07:41.074
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE FOR YOURSELF,

07:41.075 --> 07:43.076
MR. SCUZZBUCKET?

07:45.045 --> 07:46.111
HMM.

07:46.112 --> 07:48.346
A RUTHLESS,
VIOLENT ATTITUDE.

07:48.347 --> 07:50.447
I LIKE THAT.

07:50.448 --> 07:51.947
YOU'RE HIRED.

07:55.284 --> 07:57.119
OK, TURTLES. I'M IN.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.419
GREAT, CASEY.

07:58.420 --> 08:00.587
NOW KEEP AN EYE OUT
FOR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

08:00.588 --> 08:02.456
AND ABOVE ALL,
BE CAREFUL.

08:02.457 --> 08:04.523
DON'T WORRY.
I WILL.

08:04.524 --> 08:06.057
HEY, JONES!

08:06.058 --> 08:07.592
QUIT TALKING
TO YOURSELF.

08:07.593 --> 08:08.892
THERE'S WORK
TO BE DONE.

08:10.795 --> 08:12.428
REMEMBER, JONES.

08:12.429 --> 08:14.997
I'VE GOT MY EYE ON YOU.

08:14.998 --> 08:17.531
ONE WRONG MOVE,
AND YOU'RE FIRED!

08:17.532 --> 08:18.766
OH, YEAH?

08:18.767 --> 08:20.099
FIRE THIS.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.068
[GRUNTING]

08:25.069 --> 08:27.938
WHOA! NOW, MR. JONES,

08:27.939 --> 08:29.906
I WAS ONLY FOOLING...

08:29.907 --> 08:32.607
SIR.

08:32.607 --> 08:36.243
NOW THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO SEE
IN OUR EMPLOYEES--

08:36.244 --> 08:39.211
GOOD OLD TAKE-CHARGE
AGGRESSIVENESS.

08:39.212 --> 08:43.282
SON, I SEE
BIG THINGS FOR YOU
AT OCTOPUS, INC.

08:43.283 --> 08:45.449
I'M PUTTING YOU

08:45.450 --> 08:47.784
EMPLOYEE TRAINING
PROGRAM.

08:47.785 --> 08:49.285
CASEY, COME IN.

08:49.286 --> 08:50.619
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:50.620 --> 08:52.054
THERE'S NO ANSWER.

08:52.055 --> 08:53.788
HE'D BETTER NOT BE
IN ANY TROUBLE,

08:53.789 --> 08:56.122
'CAUSE THERE'S
NO WAY WE CAN GET
HIM OUT OF THERE.

08:56.123 --> 08:57.790
NOW, THE TRAINING SEMINAR

08:57.791 --> 08:59.892
IS RIGHT
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

08:59.893 --> 09:03.027
I'M SURE IT'LL GIVE YOU
A WHOLE NEW OUTLOOK

09:03.028 --> 09:05.128
ON THIS COMPANY...

09:05.129 --> 09:09.030
BY TURNING YOU ALL
INTO MINDLESS SLAVES

09:09.031 --> 09:12.733
OF OUR BELOVED
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

09:16.303 --> 09:19.238
CASEY. CASEY, COME IN.

09:19.239 --> 09:21.873
CALLING CASEY JONES.

09:21.874 --> 09:24.107
OH, I HOPE HE'S NOT
IN ANY TROUBLE.

09:28.410 --> 09:30.911
WELCOME
TO OCTOPUS, INC.'s

09:30.912 --> 09:34.814
EXECUTIVE ASSERTIVENESS
TRAINING.

09:34.815 --> 09:36.814
AS AN OCTOPUS EMPLOYEE,

09:36.815 --> 09:39.283
YOU HAVE
ONLY ONE CONCERN--

09:39.284 --> 09:41.585
UNQUESTIONING OBEDIENCE

09:41.586 --> 09:43.720
TO OCTOPUS, INC.

09:43.721 --> 09:46.855
Men: OBEDIENCE TO
OCTOPUS, INC.

09:46.856 --> 09:50.157
OBEDIENCE TO
OCTOPUS, INC.

09:50.158 --> 09:53.359
OBEDIENCE TO
OCTOPUS, INC.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.695
OBEDIENCE TO
OCTOPUS, INC.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.663
THIS IS SOME WEIRD
KIND OF BRAINWASHING.

09:59.664 --> 10:02.198
I'M GETTING OUT
OF HERE. AAH!

10:02.199 --> 10:05.601
Men: OBEDIENCE TO
OCTOPUS, INC.

10:05.602 --> 10:07.835
FELLOWS, I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS.

10:07.836 --> 10:10.203
WE HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM CASEY
IN OVER AN HOUR.

10:10.204 --> 10:13.072
IF HE'S IN TROUBLE,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

10:13.073 --> 10:14.172
FOR SURE.

10:14.173 --> 10:15.673
WE CAN'T FIGHT OFF

10:15.674 --> 10:17.408
ALL THOSE WHITE-COLLAR
CRAZIES.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.743
WELL, GET READY
TO FIGHT OFF AT LEAST
4 OF THEM. LOOK.

10:20.744 --> 10:22.177
THEY'RE GOING
TO HIT

10:22.178 --> 10:23.945
THE ITTY BITTY
CORPORATION!

10:23.946 --> 10:26.280
TALK ABOUT SCRAPING
THE BOTTOM
OF THE BARREL.

10:26.281 --> 10:28.448
HEY, THIS GIVES ME
A CHANCE TO TRY OUT

10:28.449 --> 10:30.049
MY NEW SECRET WEAPON.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.350
LIKE, WHAT NEW
SECRET WEAPON?

10:32.351 --> 10:33.619
YOU'LL SEE.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.686
ALL RIGHT,
LAWBREAKERS!

10:35.687 --> 10:36.753
FREEZE!

10:36.754 --> 10:39.088
Raphael: OH, NOT AGAIN.

10:39.089 --> 10:40.422
WHOA!
AAH!

10:43.425 --> 10:45.692
THAT'S LIFE
IN THE BIG CITY.

10:45.693 --> 10:47.959
ALL RIGHT,
YOU CORPORATE CREEPS,

10:47.960 --> 10:49.528
PREPARE TO FACE...

10:49.529 --> 10:51.629
THE RETRO-CATAPULT!

10:53.932 --> 10:56.966
A GIZMO THAT
FLINGS GARBAGE?

10:56.967 --> 10:58.866
THE FORCES
OF EVIL EVERYWHERE

10:58.867 --> 11:00.535
ARE QUAKING IN TERROR.

11:02.604 --> 11:04.504
COME ON, WE'LL GET
THEIR WEAPONS.

11:06.073 --> 11:07.940
IF THEIR WEAPONS
DON'T GET US FIRST.

11:07.941 --> 11:10.274
A BUCKET OF WATER?

11:10.275 --> 11:12.542
TERMINATE THEM.

11:12.543 --> 11:14.877
GET THEIR BLASTERS!

11:14.878 --> 11:16.679
WH--WHAT?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.313
WHERE AM I?

11:18.314 --> 11:19.880
THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER

11:19.881 --> 11:22.215
WAS GOING TO THE OCTOPUS
TRAINING SEMINAR.

11:22.216 --> 11:24.216
DO YOU WORK
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.?

11:24.217 --> 11:27.885
NO, BUT SOME
OF THEIR EXECUTIVES
KIDNAPPED ME.

11:27.886 --> 11:29.787
NOW I GET IT!

11:29.788 --> 11:32.622
ALL THE OCTOPUS, INC.
PEOPLE ARE BRAINWASHED.

11:32.623 --> 11:34.556
AND EVERYONE
THEY'VE KIDNAPPED, TOO.

11:34.557 --> 11:37.525
YEAH. BUT NOW WE'VE
GOT A WEAPON...

11:37.526 --> 11:40.059
'CAUSE WATER UNDOES
THE BRAINWASHING!

11:40.060 --> 11:42.395
WHOA! I GUESS THERE'S
JUST NOTHING LIKE

11:42.396 --> 11:43.895
A BUCKET OF SOAPY WATER

11:43.896 --> 11:45.730
TO MAKE A DUDE
COME CLEAN.

11:45.731 --> 11:47.064
THEN LET'S HURRY,

11:47.065 --> 11:48.898
BECAUSE UNLESS
I MISS MY GUESS,

11:48.899 --> 11:52.234
CASEY JONES IS IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

11:52.235 --> 11:53.703
WE'LL SEND HELP.

11:56.038 --> 11:59.172
YOU WILL LAY DOWN
YOUR LIVES FOR OCTOPUS, INC.

11:59.173 --> 12:02.908
Men: WE WILL
LAY DOWN OUR LIVES
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.

12:02.909 --> 12:06.176
YOU WILL BECOME
TOTAL CORPORATE SLAVES.

12:06.177 --> 12:10.512
I WILL BECOME A TOTAL
CORPORATE SLAVE.

12:10.513 --> 12:12.514
EXCUSE US, MA'AM.

12:12.515 --> 12:16.283
WE ALL ARE CITY
WASHBASIN INSPECTORS.

12:16.284 --> 12:17.617
YOU'RE WHAT?

12:17.618 --> 12:20.186
WE'RE HERE TO CHECK OUT
A SERIOUS VIOLATION

12:20.187 --> 12:22.921
OF CITY CODE
NUMBER 317-B-MINUS.

12:22.922 --> 12:24.621
UH, THAT WOULD BE
CRACKED PORCELAIN.

12:24.622 --> 12:27.691
I'M SORRY.
I'LL HAVE TO CLEAR YOU.

12:27.692 --> 12:28.925
NO TIME, MA'AM.

12:28.926 --> 12:31.459
THIS HERE'S A SERIOUS
BUREAUCRATIC EMERGENCY.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.661
BUT, BUT, BUT...

12:33.662 --> 12:37.697
YOU'LL DESTROY AND PLUNDER
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.

12:37.698 --> 12:41.399
I WILL DESTROY
AND PLUNDER
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.001
Michelangelo: YO! C.J.!

12:43.002 --> 12:44.367
SNAP OUT OF IT.

12:44.368 --> 12:45.668
THERE'S NO USE.

12:45.669 --> 12:47.236
THIS GUY'S
IN LA-LA LAND.

12:47.237 --> 12:49.271
TOTALLY ZONED.

12:49.272 --> 12:50.905
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

12:50.906 --> 12:54.041
DONATELLO,
LET HIM HAVE IT.

12:54.042 --> 12:55.775
HEY, WHAT THE HECK?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.109
YOU'RE FREE!

12:57.110 --> 12:58.276
COME ON.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.611
JUST A MINUTE.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.379
I FEEL AN OVERWHELMING
NEED TO BREAK SOMETHING.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.982
NAMELY, THIS STINKING
HYPNOTIC EQUIPMENT!

13:06.983 --> 13:10.384
HYAH!

13:10.385 --> 13:11.818
IT WOULD BE
A LOT HEALTHIER

13:11.819 --> 13:14.087
IF YOU JUST LET
YOUR FEELINGS OUT.

13:14.088 --> 13:17.189
THE PURPOSE OF THIS
MEETING, GENTLEMEN,

13:17.190 --> 13:18.957
IS TO ANNOUNCE
THAT OCTOPUS, INC.'s

13:18.958 --> 13:20.791
MOST HUSH-HUSH PROJECT

13:20.792 --> 13:22.892
IS FINALLY NEARING
COMPLETION.

13:22.893 --> 13:23.926
I GIVE YOU...

13:23.927 --> 13:26.028
OCTOPUS STADIUM!

13:26.029 --> 13:28.896
THIS EVENING,
ALL OCTOPUS EMPLOYEES,

13:28.897 --> 13:30.463
AS WELL AS NEW RECRUITS,

13:30.464 --> 13:33.799
WILL GATHER IN THE STADIUM
FOR THE GRAND ARISING

13:33.800 --> 13:36.501
AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD!

13:36.502 --> 13:38.302
GRAND ARISING?

13:38.303 --> 13:40.170
OF WHAT,
EXACTLY?

13:40.171 --> 13:41.304
YOU'VE GOT ME.

13:41.305 --> 13:43.005
ALL I KNOW IS
WE'VE GOT TO--

13:43.006 --> 13:44.172
STOP THEM!

13:45.475 --> 13:46.640
OH, YEAH?

13:46.641 --> 13:48.409
TAKE THIS!

13:51.178 --> 13:52.311
COME ON, DUDE,

13:52.312 --> 13:54.613
HELP US GET
WET AND WILD!

13:54.614 --> 13:57.547
UH-OH. ANOTHER
CORPORATE DIVISION.

13:57.548 --> 13:59.682
TURTLE POWER!

14:02.052 --> 14:04.719
IT'S RETRO-CATAPULT
TIME AGAIN.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.953
THIS TIME IT WILL
WORK FOR SURE.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.489
OH, NO.
NOT AGAIN!

14:13.593 --> 14:15.926
I'M BEGINNING TO HATE
THAT INVENTION.

14:17.495 --> 14:20.162
<i>HEY, COMPADRES,
DO SOMETHING!</i>

14:20.163 --> 14:22.063
WE'RE RUNNING OUT
OF AMMO!

14:22.064 --> 14:24.465
NO SWEAT,
MICHELANGELO.

14:24.466 --> 14:26.833
AM I BRILLIANT,
OR WHAT?

14:29.302 --> 14:30.735
FORGET I ASKED.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.837
THE SPRINKLERS
ARE OUT, TOO!

14:32.838 --> 14:35.439
Donatello: FELLAS, MAYBE
THE WATER WON'T RUN,

14:35.440 --> 14:37.973
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T!

14:39.809 --> 14:42.375
QUICK! CASEY,
USE YOUR BAT!

14:42.376 --> 14:45.611
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO SAY PLEASE.

14:49.715 --> 14:51.348
¶ NYAH, NYAH
NYAH, NYAH ¶

14:51.349 --> 14:53.249
¶ YOU CAN'T
GET US ¶

14:53.250 --> 14:55.185
WILL YOU COOL IT,
MICHELANGELO.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.653
WE'VE GOT MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:57.654 --> 15:01.188
LIKE FIGURING OUT
WHY SOMEONE CUT OFF
THE WATER SUPPLY.

15:01.189 --> 15:03.589
PROBABLY BECAUSE
THEY'RE WISE
TO WHAT IT DOES.

15:03.590 --> 15:05.557
RIGHTEOUS NOTION, DUDE.

15:05.558 --> 15:07.925
WHICH MEANS THAT
SOMEONE AROUND HERE

15:07.926 --> 15:09.827
ISN'T HYPNOTIZED!

15:09.828 --> 15:11.595
AND I'LL LAY
EVEN MONEY

15:11.596 --> 15:13.763
HE'S BEHIND
THAT DOOR.

15:13.764 --> 15:15.730
"OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT."

15:15.731 --> 15:16.965
HEH! LET'S GO FOR IT!

15:18.900 --> 15:20.466
ALL RIGHT, MISTER.

15:20.467 --> 15:22.535
WE'RE GOING TO PUT
YOU OUT OF BUSINESS.

15:22.536 --> 15:23.735
OOPS!

15:23.736 --> 15:25.203
ON THE CONTRARY,

15:25.204 --> 15:27.004
I'VE A FEW
CORPORATE STRATEGIES

15:27.005 --> 15:29.005
I'VE BEEN WAITING
TO SHOW YOU.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.244
SHREDDER!

15:36.245 --> 15:38.078
SO YOU'RE THE ONE
BEHIND ALL THESE

15:38.079 --> 15:39.779
CHROME-COLLAR CRIMES.

15:39.780 --> 15:41.213
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:41.214 --> 15:43.348
I RULE
OCTOPUS, INC. NOW,

15:43.349 --> 15:45.482
AND I'VE SOME BUSINESS
FOR YOU TO DISCUSS

15:45.483 --> 15:48.251
WITH MY TWO
VICE PRESIDENTS.

15:48.252 --> 15:50.220
SHALL WE...

15:50.221 --> 15:52.153
TAKE A MEETING?

15:52.154 --> 15:53.888
I THINK I LIKED
THEM BETTER

15:53.889 --> 15:55.489
BEFORE THEY TURNED
RESPECTABLE.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.892
[ALL GRUNTING]

16:01.893 --> 16:04.228
Raphael: DON'T YOU AGREE
THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE

16:04.229 --> 16:06.129
IN TODAY'S WORKPLACE?

16:07.331 --> 16:08.831
WE GOT THEM, BOSS.

16:08.832 --> 16:11.065
YOU WANT US
TO FINISH THEM?

16:11.066 --> 16:13.234
NO. IT IS ALMOST TIME

16:13.235 --> 16:15.335
FOR THE GRAND ARISING.

16:15.336 --> 16:18.436
THROW THEM IN WITH
THE OLD MAN FOR NOW.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.439
AAH!

16:20.440 --> 16:21.705
I DON'T GET THIS.

16:21.706 --> 16:23.773
WHY HAS SHREDDER
TAKEN OVER THIS COMPANY?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.042
AND WHAT DOES HE WANT
WITH THAT STADIUM?

16:26.043 --> 16:28.843
AND WHAT IS THIS
GRAND ARISING BUSINESS?

16:28.844 --> 16:31.711
AND WHO'S
THAT OLD GEEZER
IN THE CORNER?

16:34.414 --> 16:37.181
UH, YO, SECRETARY,

16:37.182 --> 16:39.850
BRING ME
500 JELLY DOUGHNUTS

16:39.851 --> 16:41.752
AND A DIET SODA.

16:41.753 --> 16:44.186
I'M TRYING TO
WATCH MY WEIGHT.

16:44.187 --> 16:45.354
[KNOCK KNOCK]

16:45.355 --> 16:47.590
UH-OH. THE BOSS.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.190
ACT BUSY.

16:49.191 --> 16:50.924
YOU LAZY MUTANTS!

16:50.925 --> 16:52.325
GET THE TURTLES.

16:52.326 --> 16:55.760
THE TIME
OF THE GRAND ARISING
HAS ARRIVED.

16:55.761 --> 16:58.363
JUST A LITTLE MORE...

16:58.364 --> 17:00.330
AND THERE! GOT IT.

17:00.331 --> 17:03.432
GREAT. NOW FREE
THE REST OF US.

17:03.433 --> 17:06.099
SIR, DO YOU WORK
FOR OCTOPUS, INC.?

17:06.101 --> 17:09.102
WHAT'S WITH
THAT OLD GUY?

17:09.103 --> 17:10.502
I THINK HE'S SAYING
HE'S DEAF?

17:10.503 --> 17:13.137
NO, JUST
HARD OF HEARING.

17:13.138 --> 17:15.073
AND HIS HEARING
AID IS BROKEN.

17:15.074 --> 17:17.441
I'LL BET THAT'S
WHY HE WAS
LOCKED UP--

17:17.442 --> 17:18.842
BECAUSE HE
CAN'T HEAR,

17:18.843 --> 17:20.276
ALL THOSE
BRAINWASHING COMMANDS

17:20.277 --> 17:21.443
COULDN'T
HYPNOTIZE HIM.

17:21.444 --> 17:23.845
THERE.
IT'S AS GOOD AS NEW.

17:23.846 --> 17:26.080
OH, THANK YOU.

17:26.082 --> 17:27.881
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

17:27.882 --> 17:29.715
I'M OCTAVIUS OGLEBY.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.484
I'M THE PRESIDENT
OF OCTOPUS, INC.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.285
NOT ANYMORE.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.320
A DUDE NAMED
SHREDDER IS
THE BIG KAHUNA NOW.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.620
SHREDDER?

17:37.621 --> 17:40.489
BUT HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A SILENT PARTNER.

17:40.490 --> 17:42.958
WHAT DOES HE WANT
WITH OCTOPUS STADIUM?

17:42.959 --> 17:45.259
AND WHAT'S THIS
GRAND ARISING?

17:45.260 --> 17:46.859
I DON'T KNOW.

17:46.860 --> 17:48.595
WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK
THE BLUEPRINTS.

17:48.596 --> 17:51.495
Casey Jones: :
IF WE DON'T GET TO
BREAK SOMETHING SOON,

17:51.496 --> 17:53.564
I'M GONNA GO NUTS.

17:53.565 --> 17:56.633
Raphael: FUNNY,
I THOUGHT YOU
WENT NUTS YEARS AGO.

17:56.634 --> 17:59.368
BUT THIS ISN'T
THE ORIGINAL PLAN.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.403
HE'S TOTALLY CHANGED IT.

18:01.404 --> 18:04.304
I TAKE IT THIS
INCREDIBLY ELABORATE
HYDRAULIC SYSTEM

18:04.305 --> 18:05.571
IS A NEW ADDITION?

18:05.572 --> 18:06.939
YES--

18:06.940 --> 18:09.374
BUT THE ONLY REASON
HE COULD POSSIBLY WANT IT

18:09.375 --> 18:12.076
IS TO RAISE SOMETHING
OUT OF THE EARTH BELOW.

18:12.077 --> 18:15.078
SO THAT'S WHAT
THE GRAND ARISING IS.

18:15.079 --> 18:17.213
HE'S GONNA RAISE
THE TECHNO-DROME

18:17.214 --> 18:18.447
BACK TO THE SURFACE.

18:18.448 --> 18:19.581
HMM.

18:19.582 --> 18:20.915
WHAT ARE THESE
OLD BUILDINGS

18:20.916 --> 18:22.382
BENEATH THE STADIUM?

18:22.383 --> 18:25.952
THE RUINS
OF THE GREAT OCTOPUS
EXPOSITION OF 1890.

18:25.953 --> 18:27.452
IT WAS BUILT
TO CELEBRATE

18:27.453 --> 18:29.887
THE FOUNDING
OF THE COMPANY
100 YEARS AGO.

18:29.888 --> 18:32.689
WELL, TODAY
IT'S GOING TO SAVE
YOUR COMPANY...

18:32.690 --> 18:34.591
ALONG WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

18:34.592 --> 18:35.758
COME ON!

18:44.631 --> 18:48.166
GET YOUR GRAND
ARISING PROGRAMS.

18:48.167 --> 18:50.400
YOU CAN'T TELL
WHAT'S ARISING

18:50.401 --> 18:52.268
WITHOUT A PROGRAM.

18:52.269 --> 18:54.570
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

18:54.571 --> 18:56.537
OH, GEE, BOSS.

18:56.538 --> 18:58.505
CAN'T A JUNIOR EXECUTIVE

18:58.506 --> 19:01.007
RAKE IN A COUPLE
OF EXTRA BUCKS?

19:01.008 --> 19:04.843
YEAH, WE WANT TO BE
BIG BUSINESS TYPHOONS.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.711
IT'S ALMOST TIME
FOR THE GRAND ARISING.

19:08.712 --> 19:12.014
GET DOWN AND MAKE SURE
THE HYDRAULICS
ARE IN ORDER.

19:12.015 --> 19:13.649
NOW TO GET TO WORK.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.182
ALL RIGHT.

19:15.183 --> 19:17.584
LET'S WASTE
THIS PILE OF JUNK.

19:17.585 --> 19:19.052
HOLD IT, DUDE.

19:19.053 --> 19:22.320
THIS IS A MUCHO
DELICATO OPERATION.

19:22.321 --> 19:25.422
TONIGHT YOU WILL BE
WITNESSES TO HISTORY

19:25.423 --> 19:27.357
AS THE TECHNO-DROME
ONCE AGAIN

19:27.358 --> 19:29.159
COMES TO THE SURFACE
OF THE EARTH.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.626
WITH YOU
AS MY FAITHFUL ARMY

19:31.627 --> 19:33.194
OF MINDLESS FOLLOWERS,

19:33.195 --> 19:35.529
I WILL RULE THE WORLD.

19:35.530 --> 19:37.330
Men: RULE THE WORLD.

19:37.331 --> 19:39.832
RULE THE WORLD...

19:39.833 --> 19:43.268
LET THE GRAND ARISING
BEGIN!

19:43.269 --> 19:44.901
HOW'S IT COMING,
DONATELLO?

19:44.902 --> 19:46.369
ALMOST DONE.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.404
ANOTHER FEW SECONDS.

19:48.405 --> 19:50.405
THERE. IT'S FINISHED.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.340
YEAH! AND SO ARE WE!

19:53.341 --> 19:55.675
I'LL SAY YOU ARE.

19:55.676 --> 19:57.177
HANG ON, GUYS.

19:57.178 --> 20:00.878
OH, NO. NOT THAT ROLLING
BOOBY-TRAP AGAIN!

20:00.879 --> 20:03.114
I PROMISE YOU
THIS TIME IT'LL WORK.

20:04.949 --> 20:07.850
OW!
OOH!

20:07.851 --> 20:10.818
SUPREMO INVENTION!

20:15.189 --> 20:16.956
IT'S STARTING
TO RISE.

20:16.957 --> 20:18.623
GET THEM
OUT OF HERE!

20:18.624 --> 20:21.926
THE TECHNO-DROME RETURNS!

20:22.926 --> 20:24.794
OW!
YEOW!

20:24.795 --> 20:26.294
WHAT?

20:32.266 --> 20:33.966
WHAT? WHERE AM I?

20:33.967 --> 20:36.369
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE TECHNO-DROME?

20:36.370 --> 20:38.603
THE TURTLES WERE
FOOLING AROUND

20:38.604 --> 20:40.937
WITH THE PLUMBING
DOWN BELOW.

20:40.938 --> 20:42.371
YEAH, BOSS.

20:45.775 --> 20:48.175
HMPH! AH...
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:48.176 --> 20:50.243
I DON'T REMEMBER
A THING.

20:50.244 --> 20:51.811
NOR I.

20:51.812 --> 20:53.444
WE MUST'VE BEEN
HYPNOTIZED.

20:53.445 --> 20:55.446
THEY'RE ALL COMING
TO THEIR SENSES.

20:55.447 --> 20:56.947
WE MUST FLEE!

20:56.948 --> 20:58.914
OH, DOES THAT MEAN

20:58.915 --> 21:01.517
WE GOT TO GIVE BACK
THESE SUITS?

21:01.518 --> 21:03.252
THANKS TO YOU,

21:03.253 --> 21:05.453
MY CORPORATION
HAS BEEN SAVED.

21:05.454 --> 21:06.787
IT WOULD'VE HAVE
NEEDED SAVING

21:06.788 --> 21:08.322
IF YOU HADN'T
DONE BUSINESS

21:08.323 --> 21:10.123
WITH AN EVIL FIEND
LIKE SHREDDER.

21:10.124 --> 21:11.390
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:11.391 --> 21:13.391
HE WAS QUITE
THE SLIMEBALL.

21:13.392 --> 21:15.626
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO MY CONSCIENCE.

21:15.627 --> 21:17.161
BUT FROM NOW ON,

21:17.162 --> 21:18.594
I PROMISE YOU,

21:18.595 --> 21:20.662
THERE WILL BE
A NEW OCTOPUS, INC.

21:20.663 --> 21:22.264
NO LONGER WILL GREED

21:22.265 --> 21:24.298
BE OUR SINGLE
MOTIVATING FACTOR.

21:24.299 --> 21:26.432
WE WILL CLEAN UP
THE ENVIRONMENT.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.501
WE WILL HELP
THE UNDERPRIVILEGED.

21:28.502 --> 21:31.469
WE WILL MAKE THIS
A BETTER WORLD
FOR EVERYONE.

21:31.470 --> 21:34.738
REGARDLESS OF RACE,
CREED, OR COLOR.

21:34.739 --> 21:36.372
EVEN GREEN?

21:36.373 --> 21:38.674
ESPECIALLY GREEN.

21:38.675 --> 21:41.042
HEY, IT MAY NOT BE
A REALISTIC ENDING,

21:41.043 --> 21:42.710
BUT IT IS A HAPPY ONE.
