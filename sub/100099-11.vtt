WEBVTT

00:59.668 --> 01:01.322
Come with me if you wanna live.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.204
-Ta-da!

01:14.248 --> 01:15.510
- Oh...
- You okay?

01:15.553 --> 01:17.207
Your candy tray awaits,
milady.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.167
Okay, guys.
I appreciate the breakup feast,
but I'm fine.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.300
And deny us a night
of guilt-free chocolate?
I don't think so.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.694
Really. I think it's good
Brainy and I broke up.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.304
Right.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.393
I'm being honest.
Look...

01:29.437 --> 01:31.265
Brainy clearly has some...

01:31.308 --> 01:33.484
emotional complexities
that I wasn't aware of.

01:33.528 --> 01:37.140
And whether that's because
of the personality inhibitors
or not,

01:37.184 --> 01:38.750
it's better to know now.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.840
Well, I will be honest.
I am a bit worried
about Brainy.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.799
Yeah. I mean,
it must be so strange

01:43.842 --> 01:46.541
to have your whole self
just shift like that.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.675
So, how's it been at the DEO?

01:50.719 --> 01:52.808
Can't believe Lex owns it
in this universe.

01:52.851 --> 01:56.942
Employees get stock options
and four weeks paid vacation.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.249
But no beach vacation
can mask evil.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.383
Just wish we knew
what he was up to.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.478
Ooh, you're welcome

02:10.520 --> 02:11.566
for the breakout,

02:12.088 --> 02:13.089
by the way.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.267
You know, I figured
I would save my thanks

02:17.311 --> 02:18.921
until after I heard
your proposition.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.707
Hmm, that's a bold stance

02:22.751 --> 02:25.057
from a guy who
got himself arrested, what,

02:25.101 --> 02:28.365
16 hours after coming here
from another Earth?

02:28.409 --> 02:30.541
So, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.413
Aw, that's very kind of you.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.850
And since you know
so much about me,

02:34.893 --> 02:37.766
why don't you tell me
who the hell you are?

02:37.809 --> 02:39.550
The name's Lex Luthor.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.986
That's a weird name.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.119
No weirder than Toyman.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.339
That was your father's name,
wasn't it?

02:45.382 --> 02:47.515
You need to think bigger.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.647
Like your dad.

02:49.691 --> 02:52.084
He was gonna be
the biggest toymaker
of all time.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.391
Just moved
into virtual reality, but,

02:54.435 --> 02:57.568
mmm, his partner
stole his patent, right?

02:57.612 --> 02:59.744
Right, and then he snapped.

02:59.788 --> 03:02.051
People say he went
on a rampage.

03:03.748 --> 03:09.101
I say that they had it coming.

03:09.145 --> 03:12.279
And then,
he killed himself.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.545
Wouldn't you like to show them
how wrong they were?

03:20.287 --> 03:22.550
That's what I was doing.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.943
What you were doing
was getting caught.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.642
But with my resources,

03:27.685 --> 03:30.210
you could make the Schott name
synonymous with genius

03:30.253 --> 03:33.996
and chaos instead of failure
and... who?

03:34.039 --> 03:35.258
I have something for you.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.482
The National City
Toy Convention.

03:41.525 --> 03:46.661
And, as a bonus,
I believe an old friend
of yours,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.228
Chester Dunholtz,
will be there.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.710
Well, it has been a pleasure
doing business with you,
Winslow.

03:52.754 --> 03:53.842
Oh, and one more thing,

03:54.843 --> 03:56.323
whatever you do,

03:57.019 --> 03:59.195
make it splashy.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.329
If we're gonna build you
a legacy, it's gonna need to
survive well into the future.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.164
Lena.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.297
Just the Luthor
I was hoping to find.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.560
Did you look for me
in my office?

04:16.603 --> 04:19.476
Where I said I would be,
working on Non Nocere,
waiting for you.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.696
Ooh, right, sorry.
Something came up.

04:21.738 --> 04:25.743
This new universe has shifted
the frequency of Q-waves.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.963
I'm back at square one.
I needed your help.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.487
I understand,
but we have bigger problems,

04:30.531 --> 04:34.491
like Leviathan.
You undersold them, sweet Lena.

04:34.535 --> 04:35.753
He's right.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.671
Leviathan is the greatest
threat of our time.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.979
-Brainy.
-Agent Dox is assisting me
with a project.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.850
You know he's friends
with Supergirl, right?

04:45.894 --> 04:47.635
There's no need
for concern.

04:47.678 --> 04:51.073
Since I removed
my personality inhibitors,
I run on logic only.

04:51.116 --> 04:54.903
And my calculations tell me
that, at this time, Lex Luthor

04:54.946 --> 04:57.862
is on the right side
of history.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.908
Can you promise me
no one will get hurt?

04:59.951 --> 05:02.214
I promise no one
will be harmed.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.347
Especially
if you help us.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.088
As with the Q-waves,

05:06.131 --> 05:08.699
the recent fusing
of the universes
might have shifted

05:08.743 --> 05:11.398
what Andrea Rojas knows
about Leviathan.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.877
If there was some way of

05:12.921 --> 05:15.967
-finding out--
-You want me to talk to Andrea?

05:16.011 --> 05:18.274
It won't do any good.
She's not gonna
tell me anything.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.624
We're not friends.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.410
The Lena I know wouldn't let
a little thing like friendship

05:23.453 --> 05:25.977
get in the way
of saving the world.

05:26.021 --> 05:30.678
And as a thank you,
I can guarantee you
a source of Q-waves

05:30.721 --> 05:32.419
by the end of tomorrow.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.596
Well,
if you will excuse me,

05:36.771 --> 05:38.294
I have to get my beauty sleep.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.035
They're unveiling
my new action figure

05:40.078 --> 05:41.993
at National City Toycon
tomorrow.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.952
I anticipate many photo ops.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.879
There are so many.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.968
I expected to be
a collector's item.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.839
-Kara Danvers?
-There he is.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.625
How did I get so lucky
that CatCo would send
their Pulitzer winner

06:04.668 --> 06:06.975
to cover the unveiling
of my little trinket?

06:07.018 --> 06:09.151
We are the lucky ones,
Mr. Luthor.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.109
And who is this
new cub reporter?

06:11.153 --> 06:12.720
-William Dey.
-Mmm.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.330
I covered your Kasnian victory
for The Times of London.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.072
I remember that piece.
You called me fat.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.726
I believe it was bloated ego,

06:18.769 --> 06:20.641
and in reference
to your victory parade.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.207
Oh, yes!
That was a good parade.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.818
Oh, shame Supergirl
couldn't make it.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.429
-Ah...
-I bet your editor would
have loved a twofer.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.431
Say, she's a friend of yours,
isn't she,

06:28.475 --> 06:32.653
Ms. Danvers? I mean,
how would Supergirl feel
about these action figures?

06:32.696 --> 06:36.265
-Two heroes saving the world.

06:36.308 --> 06:40.443
You know what?
I'm more interested
in how you feel, sir.

06:40.487 --> 06:41.488
Uh, in a word,

06:41.836 --> 06:43.054
valiant.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.143
Mr. Luthor,
is it true you plan to develop

06:45.187 --> 06:47.494
Shelley Island
as an energy source?

06:47.537 --> 06:49.844
This planet is in
an energy crisis.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.498
I'm just trying to do my part.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.805
Is that why you attempted
to take over
Rogers Engineering?

06:54.849 --> 06:56.503
You wanted to get
into biomechanics,

06:56.546 --> 07:00.158
but Russell Rogers
refused to sell,
and he disappeared.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.378
You don't know what happened
to him, do you?

07:03.292 --> 07:04.467
No.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.382
And this has been a delight.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.646
I have a very busy day.
Why don't you take
one of these, on the house?

07:09.690 --> 07:12.519
-Uh, Ms. Danvers,
a quick word, please?
-Yes, I'll be right back.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.349
This was supposed
to be a puff piece.

07:17.393 --> 07:20.004
Why did I just get
Frost/Nixoned by a Boy Scout?

07:20.048 --> 07:23.399
Since I have been
on this Earth, I have done
nothing but protect and serve.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.358
Judging me for the crimes
of another Earth's Lex, well,
that's not fair now, is it?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.709
I'm gonna find out
what you're doing at the DEO.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.363
So much moxie!

07:31.407 --> 07:36.847
Let me make myself clear.
If young Woodward decides
to proceed with his Lexpose,

07:36.891 --> 07:40.285
it will prove very,
very dangerous for his health,
off the record.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.200
-Have a nice day.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.028
Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.247
-Give me that.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.774
Supergirl, there's an armed
sniper at the toy convention.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.428
-I'm already there.
-Great, we're almost there.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.473
I'll look for him.

07:59.957 --> 08:03.961
We need this place evacuated
and locked down.
We do not wanna cause a panic.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.233
Does this feel like...

08:15.712 --> 08:17.453
Like Toyman.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.325
They're bombs.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.329
He's got a gun!

08:28.769 --> 08:30.422
Up there! Up there!

08:31.859 --> 08:34.731
-Wait, that looks just like--
-Winn! But how?

08:37.168 --> 08:38.386
Oh, no!

08:42.130 --> 08:43.304
What?

08:59.234 --> 09:00.627
Winn?

09:00.670 --> 09:01.932
What are you doing here?

09:01.976 --> 09:04.282
Saving Chester Dunholtz
and my future.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.806
Have you seen Toyman?

09:05.849 --> 09:08.678
-Uh...
-The shooter! The guy
wearing my face!

09:14.162 --> 09:15.816
-I've got him.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.137
Oh, come on, come on!

09:33.181 --> 09:34.922
Damn it. Brainy,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.011
I need you to lock on
to every traffic camera
in National City,

09:37.054 --> 09:39.361
and please,
please find this guy.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.885
Winn, stop.
Okay, just breathe

09:41.929 --> 09:44.366
for a minute, okay?
We're gonna find the other you,

09:44.409 --> 09:46.629
-and then we'll stop him
before he hurts someone.
-We always do.

09:46.673 --> 09:49.414
-Yeah.
-I came back to this moment
to catch him.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.502
You should have.

09:50.546 --> 09:51.634
Brainy.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.288
He's right.
I should've caught him.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.811
By now he could've
hurt someone,

09:54.855 --> 09:56.857
and if he hurts someone,
I don't think you understand.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.687
My life is over.

10:00.730 --> 10:04.734
Everything!
I will lose everything.
My wife, my daughter.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.562
Wait.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.912
You have a wife?
And a kid?

10:10.348 --> 10:12.568
Oh, my God, yes.
Yes. Uh...

10:14.788 --> 10:18.400
That's my wife, Aila.
Mary is gonna be two in April.

10:18.443 --> 10:19.967
They're beautiful. I...

10:22.404 --> 10:26.016
- Oh.
-It's so good to see you.

10:26.060 --> 10:29.672
-I mean, I might've missed you,
like, just like a little bit.
-Yeah, me too.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.762
-But just...
-Yeah, well, I missed you,
like, a lot.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.983
-It was really hard
leaving you guys.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.288
So, what happened?

10:38.855 --> 10:41.684
Well, I'd just finished
putting Mary to bed.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.643
And then somebody's knocking
on the front door,

10:43.686 --> 10:47.429
and I'm thinking,
please don't wake the baby up,
and then Aila is arguing,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.779
suddenly, with whoever it is,
defending me.

10:49.823 --> 10:53.174
So I run down there
to see what's happening,
and...

10:53.217 --> 10:55.045
it's the time cops.

10:55.089 --> 11:00.181
Accusing me of killing
Chester Dunholtz on this date,
at this time.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.922
But you didn't do it.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.054
I told them that.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
But they had my DNA

11:05.926 --> 11:09.233
to prove it, so I'm thinking,
"Okay, this must be
some type of,

11:09.277 --> 11:14.978
you know, doppelganger person
with my father's sick,
twisted brain.

11:15.022 --> 11:19.722
And now, if this Toyman
kills someone, I will never
see my family again.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.378
They'll put me in jail,
or worse, it's gonna affect
the timeline.

11:23.421 --> 11:24.945
And I will have never met Aila.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.339
Or my daughter.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.167
Okay, all right.
We'll just... Okay.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.343
Well, there must be something,
right? I mean...

11:33.214 --> 11:34.998
okay, this person.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.000
This person was found
lurking near Dunholtz,

11:37.044 --> 11:39.089
so maybe they were
working together.

11:39.133 --> 11:42.310
You know? I mean,
we've got a face.
Can we get an ID, Brainy?

11:44.616 --> 11:47.445
Yeah, I'll, um,
I'll go to the DEO

11:47.489 --> 11:50.753
and start cleaning up
the image to ID it,
tracking it.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.452
I'll, uh, also put Winn's ship
in the DEO hangar
for safekeeping.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.455
No, no, no, I do not want
the Legion ship
anywhere near Lex.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.762
You know what?
I've got an idea. I'll just
have to call an old friend.

11:59.806 --> 12:03.766
Lex as in Lex Luthor, the hero?
Why would you not want
the Legion ship near him?

12:03.810 --> 12:06.769
Uh, Lex is not a hero.

12:06.813 --> 12:10.338
We're just gonna have J'onn
just bring you up to speed
on exactly what happened.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.777
Thank you
for seeing me today.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.344
I wanted to apologize to you

12:17.998 --> 12:21.088
for how I treated you
after you took
my mother's medallion.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.611
After all these years?

12:23.873 --> 12:24.874
Why now?

12:26.397 --> 12:28.051
Andrea, I know about Leviathan.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.188
Oh.

12:34.841 --> 12:35.842
Lena...

12:38.540 --> 12:41.151
I wanted to explain everything
to you for so long.

12:41.195 --> 12:45.808
I know how dangerous
Leviathan is and how terrified
you must've been.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.506
And I understand now
that you never wanted
to betray me.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.813
No, it's been so hard.

12:50.857 --> 12:54.817
I knew I had to protect you.
I'm so relieved
that you know the truth.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.689
So am I.

12:57.733 --> 13:02.346
And anything Leviathan
has asked you to do,
we will figure it out together.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.435
They've never asked me
to do anything.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.655
All these years,
and not a word?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.962
They said
they would call on me,
but they never came.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.879
I'm so sorry.

13:12.922 --> 13:16.404
Hey, it's you and me again,
okay?

13:16.447 --> 13:18.362
You jump, I jump.

13:18.406 --> 13:22.453
If Leviathan calls you,
you come to me, okay?
I can't lose you again.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.456
Okay.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.027
Andrea knows nothing.

13:31.071 --> 13:34.248
Seems on this Earth,
post-Crisis, Leviathan
hasn't activated her yet.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.599
But don't worry, if they do,

13:38.948 --> 13:40.732
I'll be the first person
she calls.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.433
J'onn?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.130
We're here.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.959
Oh, this is nice!
Very Sam Spade.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.222
-Never realized J'onn was
such an avid reader.
-Where is he?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.615
I'm up here.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.402
Is that a secret elevator?

14:00.622 --> 14:01.797
Don't push.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.812
What is this place?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.511
In a minute. First...

14:21.861 --> 14:23.775
I am so sorry.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.256
But we will find this other you
and stop him.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.911
Yeah. You always give
the best hugs, papa bear.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.045
Okay, J'onn. Just...

14:32.088 --> 14:34.090
-You gotta tell us
about this place.
-Yeah!

14:34.134 --> 14:37.180
Well, in the wake of Crisis,
Kara, Kal-El, Barry, Kate,

14:37.224 --> 14:39.487
we established a headquarters
from which to fight crime.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.576
Oh, in the future
they call it a Hall of Justice.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.882
I like that.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.362
I thought since Luthor Corp
now owns the DEO,

14:45.406 --> 14:48.061
National City could use
its own collective.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.934
A headquarters
to keep this city safe.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.806
-To work outside of corporate
and government oversight.
- Huh.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.983
Whose interests might not
always side with justice.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.289
-So, like S.T.A.R. Labs?
-Or the Arrow bunker.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.989
Place for my super friends
to work, whenever
they should need it.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.120
What are you gonna call this?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.601
I was thinking The Tower.

15:06.644 --> 15:09.473
-Cool!
-Absolutely.

15:09.517 --> 15:13.477
So, tell me what I missed
with this whole Crisis thing.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.783
Not tell you.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.307
-Show you.
-Ah.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.266
But I must warn you.

15:19.309 --> 15:22.834
The truth of the old Earth
could be quite upsetting.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.881
Uh, not more upsetting
than what I'm already
dealing with, so

15:25.925 --> 15:26.926
how bad can it be?

15:29.189 --> 15:30.755
-Okay, get it out.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.627
Get it all out. It's okay.

15:32.670 --> 15:36.674
Whoa! Uh, so, wait,
Lena killed Lex?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.763
And then he came back to life?

15:38.807 --> 15:42.680
And James runs a small town
newspaper and mentors children?
That's adorable!

15:42.724 --> 15:43.943
And you!

15:43.986 --> 15:45.988
-You were, what,
you were Russian?
-Yes.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.251
Kasnian.
But that wasn't really me.

15:48.295 --> 15:51.124
And so evil Lex
now owns the DEO?

15:51.167 --> 15:53.256
Yeah.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.954
Oh, but let me tell you
about the doppelgangers
who came through a wormhole--

16:03.527 --> 16:04.746
Not a bad picture of you.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.400
I don't understand.

16:06.443 --> 16:10.186
In every simulation I ran,
we always apprehended Toyman.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.146
-He never got away.
-What I don't understand
is why you're here

16:13.189 --> 16:14.930
and the Legion ship is not.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.284
Director Danvers thought
it would be safer to
secure the ship

16:21.328 --> 16:24.548
at a government black site
three miles south
of the National City border.

16:24.592 --> 16:27.116
Thank you.
And once I get there,
how do I access

16:27.160 --> 16:29.205
what the ship knows
about Leviathan?

16:29.249 --> 16:31.599
There is a panel
on the right quadrant.

16:31.642 --> 16:35.559
You have Winn Schott's DNA
from his hair.
That's all you'll need.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.692
Now, our mission is over.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.476
Call off Toyman.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.478
Does he look like
my personal attack dog?

16:41.522 --> 16:44.003
He's underground.
Toyboy is smarter
than we gave him credit for.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.400
-Toyman will strike again.
-Then get out there
with your little do-good crew

16:50.444 --> 16:51.575
and take care of it.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.451
Hello, National City!

16:57.494 --> 17:01.890
Well, by now
you might've heard that my splashy show at Toycon

17:01.933 --> 17:05.241
caused, well,
a little bit of ruckus.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.895
J'onn, can you track
his location?

17:08.156 --> 17:10.116
He's blocked his IP address
and signal.

17:10.159 --> 17:14.032
Whatever technology he's using,
it's something
that I've never seen before.

17:14.076 --> 17:17.165
And I have got
a bigger bang in mind.

17:17.210 --> 17:20.169
Now, tell me.
Have you ever been

17:20.213 --> 17:24.739
so unfairly wronged
that it just made you wanna

17:24.781 --> 17:26.348
burn it all down?

17:27.349 --> 17:28.830
Well, I have.

17:29.396 --> 17:30.745
And I'm angry.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.965
Someone hurt my family

17:34.009 --> 17:37.230
and they destroyed
my father's good name.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.275
-Look at that.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.842
People are supporting him.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.192
-He's collecting followers.
- So,

17:43.236 --> 17:47.327
I have the target,
I have the method,
and what I need now...

17:47.805 --> 17:48.937
is you.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.113
Give me the will.

17:51.157 --> 17:55.117
Like me, subscribe, share,
follow me, and once I reach

17:55.161 --> 17:57.815
one million followers,

17:57.859 --> 18:01.471
you will see
a fireworks display

18:01.515 --> 18:04.866
like never before.
So, let's play to win!

18:04.909 --> 18:06.737
Huh?

18:06.781 --> 18:07.869
Until next time.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.611
I am hashtag

18:11.525 --> 18:12.526
Toyman.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.532
Uh, guys?

18:23.014 --> 18:24.625
If he wins, I'm dead.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.938
I can't believe
all these people
are rooting for violence.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.375
Well, the anonymity
of the internet

18:35.418 --> 18:37.333
brings out everyone's
basest instincts.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.380
Sure,
but how would those people feel
if they were the target?

18:40.423 --> 18:43.600
Unfortunately,
this is a distinctly
21st century problem.

18:43.644 --> 18:47.996
By, what, 2126,
anti-trolling legislations
are in place around the world.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.519
-Stopped World War Three.
-Huh?

18:49.563 --> 18:51.869
I should not
have told you that. Whoa.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.697
I'll go sweep the city.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.351
See what I can find
in the real world.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.920
If you need me, just call.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.141
J'onn, that's genius!

19:04.317 --> 19:06.884
Director Danvers,
I got your call.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.061
Yes, this place is genius.

19:10.105 --> 19:13.064
Brainy, I'm glad
that you're here.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.938
Look, the Toyman is using
some sort of IP address blocker
from his world,

19:16.981 --> 19:20.420
-and we just can't--
-I know. I've been trying
to track him from the DEO.

19:20.463 --> 19:23.945
Have you had any luck
identifying Toyman's accomplice
from that image?

19:25.642 --> 19:27.949
The image was too obscure
to get a clear ID.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.603
Well, we might have something
on board the Legion ship that
can help enhance the image--

19:29.646 --> 19:31.431
-I said I'd do it.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.825
And I will.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.917
Andrea needs me.
I have to go to CatCo.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.615
I'll call you if anything pops.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.057
-Kara.
-Huh?

19:50.624 --> 19:53.975
I think there's a connection
between Lex and Toyman.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.629
Actually, yeah. Um,

19:55.672 --> 19:57.239
-I need to talk to you
about that--
-When the DEO put Toycon

19:57.283 --> 19:59.241
on lockdown,
Lex had just slipped up.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.244
Okay, I believe that Lex
is not who he says he is.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.463
But...

20:03.506 --> 20:05.595
that means we have to be smart,
because

20:05.639 --> 20:08.468
if he's dangerous,
we can't just go around
making baseless accusations--

20:08.511 --> 20:12.646
Kara, we're reporters.
We dig into hunches,
no matter the risk.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.952
Kara.

20:14.996 --> 20:18.782
When I call you in
for a meeting, I expect you
to come directly to me.

20:18.826 --> 20:22.264
-Mmm-hmm.
-William, I need you
with me today.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.788
My father's alma mater
is honoring the family

20:24.832 --> 20:27.530
for our advancement
in tech and entertainment.

20:27.574 --> 20:31.273
I'm going to announce
the next phase of
Obsidian VR at the event.

20:31.317 --> 20:34.276
Obsidian Platinum will be
like nothing anyone
has ever seen before.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.104
William, I want you
to cover it.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.801
-I'd rather not--
-That's a great idea.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.543
-Thank you, Kara.
-It's a good idea.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.153
And I have something special
for you too.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.807
Okay.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.766
You were friends
with Winn Schott
when he worked for CatCo,

20:45.809 --> 20:48.290
before disappearing
two years ago, right?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.118
Uh, yes.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.338
Mmm, bet you never thought
he'd reappear with
such an evil splash.

20:52.381 --> 20:55.210
I'd like an exclusive.
Immediately.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.603
No!

20:56.646 --> 20:58.126
Um,

20:58.169 --> 21:01.347
I'm sorry. No!
That is not
the Winn Schott I know,

21:01.390 --> 21:03.523
and I will not give a platform
to a madman.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.482
Toyman already has a platform.

21:06.526 --> 21:10.704
His video went viral
across five continents
in under an hour.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.749
We have to capitalize
on that kind of traffic.

21:12.793 --> 21:16.144
We don't have
to promote bloodshed for
the sake of your bottom line.

21:16.187 --> 21:19.060
Actually, according
to your paycheck,

21:19.843 --> 21:21.367
yes, you do.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.457
William, be ready in an hour.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.719
Kara,

21:25.762 --> 21:27.111
get me that exclusive.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.337
You should see me now, Father.

21:35.381 --> 21:39.036
Ha! On our Earth,
they called you a psychopath,
but here,

21:39.080 --> 21:41.561
they cheer for me.

21:44.085 --> 21:48.394
And yes, it may be too late
for you, Father, but soon

21:48.437 --> 21:51.222
I will accomplish
what you could not.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.746
What you always dreamed of.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.924
I will live forever.

22:03.887 --> 22:09.937
Wait, this is
the superhero-level stuff
I have been waiting for.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.373
Wait, Nia, Nia,
wait, come here.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.548
Sorry.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.420
Winn, this is Nia.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.552
-Hello.
-Whoa, Nia.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.075
As in Nia Nal?

22:18.598 --> 22:19.947
Yeah?

22:19.990 --> 22:22.732
Wow, wow.
This is incredible. Holy...

22:22.776 --> 22:26.432
-Hi.
-I'm sorry, your great,
great, great, great, great...

22:26.475 --> 22:29.870
bunch of greats granddaughter,
Nura Nal, is, like,
one of my best friends

22:29.913 --> 22:31.741
and, like, the most
kick-ass Legionnaire.

22:31.785 --> 22:36.093
-That's crazy.
Tell me everything.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.008
Does she look like me?

22:38.052 --> 22:40.924
Okay, wait.
Let's save story time until
after we catch the bad guy.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.491
Right. Well, anything to help.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.319
Okay.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.582
Once he's hit
a million followers,
he's promised to strike.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.975
So, you'll have to work fast.

22:51.805 --> 22:52.980
She can do it.

22:54.590 --> 22:57.593
Um, right. So,
are there any markers,

22:57.637 --> 23:00.117
any specifics I can keep
an eye out for?

23:00.161 --> 23:02.119
All we know
is that he wants attention.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.426
Attention. Okay.

23:15.524 --> 23:19.267
Not you. Get out
of my head, jerk.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.534
- It's okay.

23:25.578 --> 23:26.622
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

23:26.666 --> 23:27.667
What did you see?

23:33.020 --> 23:35.065
-Nothing.
- Literally nothing?

23:36.197 --> 23:37.459
That seems unlikely.

23:37.851 --> 23:38.895
Fine.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.202
I saw a tiger.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.161
Wildcat.

23:48.905 --> 23:50.516
Um, let me.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.479
Hi.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.439
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.049
It's just...

24:03.746 --> 24:05.226
my mind's been
a little messy lately.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.881
It's okay.

24:07.924 --> 24:11.667
Do you mind telling me
exactly what you did see?

24:11.711 --> 24:14.583
It's just that Nura taught me
how to interpret dreams.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.324
I'm kinda like her Watson.

24:18.239 --> 24:22.199
I saw my ex-boyfriend
turn into a tiger
and attack me.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.336
Wildcat was my nickname
for Brainy.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.946
-Oh, I know.

24:32.514 --> 24:36.213
I just thought
I was better

24:36.257 --> 24:37.737
than letting him get
in my head.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.830
You know,
I can't tell you a whole lot
about the future,

24:45.222 --> 24:46.789
but I can tell you

24:47.486 --> 24:48.487
that you,

24:49.270 --> 24:50.532
Nia,

24:50.576 --> 24:53.448
are a powerful woman.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.407
You see this?

24:56.451 --> 24:58.627
So, I'm the only human
Legionnaire,

24:58.671 --> 25:02.762
so when I got my Legion ring,
they had to soup it up
with, like, some cool powers.

25:08.376 --> 25:12.162
-Is that dream energy?
-Yeah.

25:12.206 --> 25:15.731
So, Nura and I,
we fashioned the ring's
abilities after her and

25:16.253 --> 25:18.299
your powers.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.173
Never let anyone

25:23.217 --> 25:25.480
make you question
your own worth.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.701
Okay.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.399
And that is patented Nura Nal
advice. She would kill me
if I didn't give her credit.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.841
Thanks, Winn.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.277
-You're right.
-I know.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.801
I'm gonna try again.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.329
You must be such a great dad.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.592
I try.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.507
-Oh.

25:52.551 --> 25:56.380
It's, like, the hardest thing
that I have ever done.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.426
-I bet.
-I'm not kidding.

25:58.469 --> 26:02.865
Yes, it's like, I became a dad,
and suddenly my heart
was just...

26:02.909 --> 26:06.434
on the outside of my body.
You know?

26:06.477 --> 26:10.438
She's also my greatest
accomplishment, my little Mary.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.484
She's my legacy.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.486
Did you name her
after your mom?

26:15.530 --> 26:16.749
Well, it was either that
or Winifred.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.621
Kara was an option.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.971
-What?
-Yeah, Aila pushed for it.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.756
But if I'm being honest, um,

26:23.799 --> 26:27.673
in the future,
Kara isn't exactly
what you would call

26:27.716 --> 26:29.631
an original name choice.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.154
What are you talking about?

26:31.198 --> 26:32.591
Parents naming their children

26:32.634 --> 26:34.636
-after the legendary
Kara Zor-El.
-Oh, my gosh.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.075
-No, I like Mary.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.207
Yeah, me too.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.299
Besides, I'm not too hot
on my own
legend right now.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.999
Lex threatened to kill
one of my co-workers

26:50.043 --> 26:52.393
if I don't stop him
from investigating Lex.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.747
So, either I go against
my journalistic ethics or...

26:58.791 --> 27:00.662
or I put William in danger.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.230
Don't know how
to tell you this,

27:04.492 --> 27:08.365
but you put me in danger,
like, every day.

27:08.409 --> 27:11.673
-No, no, don't say that.
- No, you did.
No, listen, it doesn't matter.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.501
It doesn't matter though.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.546
Because I knew that
you were always gonna be there
to protect me.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.765
You're Supergirl.

27:18.201 --> 27:19.942
Being in your orbit, it's...

27:20.464 --> 27:21.640
inspiring.

27:26.079 --> 27:27.471
Oh, oh,

27:27.515 --> 27:28.951
oh, why didn't I think
of this before?

27:29.386 --> 27:30.736
Toyman!

27:30.779 --> 27:33.042
He said that he is doing
everything for his father.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.870
But his father didn't exist
on this Earth.

27:34.914 --> 27:36.785
But mine did.

27:36.829 --> 27:40.180
And so, if I was gonna go
be inspired by my father,
where would I work?

27:40.223 --> 27:42.965
We're too late.
If Toyman was here,
he's gone now.

27:43.749 --> 27:44.924
Guys.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.665
I think I found something.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.493
Andrea and her father?

27:49.537 --> 27:51.713
My dad had a board
just like this for Dunholtz.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.802
So, on Toyman's Earth,

27:53.846 --> 27:57.066
the Rojases must've had
something to do with the fall
of Winslow Schott, Sr.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.899
We have to get to CatCo.
We have to warn Andrea.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.901
She's not at CatCo.
She's at...

28:05.945 --> 28:08.121
National City University
with William.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.124
Home of the Tigers.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.291
Wow! Aren't you handsome?

28:49.249 --> 28:50.554
We're connected now,

28:50.598 --> 28:51.642
aren't we?

28:51.686 --> 28:52.948
Precisely.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.777
I'm now directly linked
to your consciousness.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.300
Then you know what I want.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.345
Give it to me.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.569
Hold.

29:06.005 --> 29:07.354
Enhance.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.183
I know you.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.664
How do I know you?

29:13.708 --> 29:15.014
Search for this woman.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.626
Oh.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.628
Of course.

29:27.026 --> 29:28.679
At Obsidian,

29:28.723 --> 29:31.682
we staked our reputation
on pushing technology
to the limits.

29:31.726 --> 29:33.815
Imagine a world

29:33.859 --> 29:36.165
where, after you've come back
from work,

29:36.209 --> 29:40.779
you slip on your Obsidian
Platinum contact lenses,
and suddenly

29:40.822 --> 29:45.174
you're on a Tuscan villa,
surrounded by
your beautiful vineyard.

29:45.218 --> 29:48.612
You set a large family table
out on your verandah

29:48.656 --> 29:52.181
where you let the wine
from your own label flow.

29:52.225 --> 29:58.622
Later, you can bottle the wine
from your vineyard and sell it
for real money.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.887
With Obsidian Platinum,

30:01.930 --> 30:06.587
you will never again
have to choose between
your life and your dream.

30:08.023 --> 30:11.505
-You can always have both.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.337
Smile!

30:36.878 --> 30:37.836
Kitty number two!

30:48.281 --> 30:49.673
Will, where are you?

30:53.460 --> 30:54.461
I got him!

31:03.992 --> 31:05.646
My powers can do that?

31:20.400 --> 31:23.055
Go after Toyman.
I've got this.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.972
Here, kitty, kitty cat.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.802
Are you trying to tame
a robot tiger?

31:31.846 --> 31:34.327
If the chair fits.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.464
Stop!

31:41.508 --> 31:42.552
Says who?

31:48.645 --> 31:50.473
Whoa, where did you come from?

31:50.517 --> 31:51.997
Yet another Earth?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.433
Actually, no,

31:53.476 --> 31:55.087
this is my Earth.

31:55.130 --> 31:58.220
-This is my life, and you are
really messing it...
-Whoa!

32:01.136 --> 32:02.181
Give me the trigger.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.357
Uh, well, that would be no fun.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.968
Is the bomb in the van?

32:07.012 --> 32:08.927
-Hmm.
-Listen to me,

32:08.970 --> 32:11.538
I know what it feels like
to wanna protect your family.
Believe me, I do.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.584
But you have also got to
create your own legacy.

32:14.628 --> 32:18.588
This is my legacy.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.155
You've seen the people.
They adore me.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.591
Dude, this isn't love.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.159
No, you're just a cheap thrill
for them, all right?

32:24.203 --> 32:25.726
Give me, give me the trigger.

32:25.769 --> 32:29.295
Can't. It's a dead man's switch
for a dead man, like me.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.514
Just stop that.
You could still change.

32:31.558 --> 32:34.039
All right? You are not Toyman.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.997
You say that name Toyman

32:36.041 --> 32:40.349
with such disdain, but you,
you do not understand.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.486
Toyman is eternal.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.219
Have you seen William?

33:24.263 --> 33:25.568
He was supposed to be here.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.745
I ran diagnostics.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.052
We lost no civilian lives
to any of Toyman's attacks.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.793
Well, that's good news.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.795
Speaking of news,
I wonder what the news
is like in the future.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.061
Hey!

33:40.105 --> 33:41.497
It's all over.

33:42.977 --> 33:44.370
Have you looked at
the wanted poster?

33:54.902 --> 33:56.077
It's gone.

33:58.862 --> 34:00.473
I know.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.739
Will, where are you?

34:05.782 --> 34:07.436
You're not gonna believe
what I saw.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.438
You were supposed to
be at the university,
and you weren't.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.527
I know how important
this story is to you,

34:12.572 --> 34:15.705
and that you won't let anything
stand in the way of
you getting it, even me,

34:15.748 --> 34:18.360
but I also know
that Lex would sooner
take someone out

34:18.404 --> 34:20.754
than let a headline be run
that threatens his reputation.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.364
-And I'm not--
-Which is why
I have been thinking,

34:25.018 --> 34:26.976
we should investigate
Lex together.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.545
There's safety
in numbers and...

34:29.589 --> 34:32.766
and if we share information,

34:32.809 --> 34:35.029
we have a better chance
at exposing him,
once and for all.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.466
You mean we'd be like...

34:38.337 --> 34:39.641
-partners?
-Exactly!

34:39.686 --> 34:41.514
Yes, who would have
each other's back.

34:42.775 --> 34:43.951
Well then,

34:43.994 --> 34:45.300
partner,

34:45.344 --> 34:48.172
I think you need to see this.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.004
My sister showed me
this hangar before, it's

34:54.047 --> 34:57.312
-high government security.
How did--
-Lex get in?

34:57.356 --> 34:59.575
-He paid off the guards.

34:59.619 --> 35:01.273
- He's got a plan.
- And we need
to find out what it is.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.665
Well, he didn't see you,
did he?

35:02.709 --> 35:03.927
-Of course not.
-Good.

35:03.971 --> 35:04.885
I was careful.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.932
So, do you wanna take a look
at the rest of my notes?

35:13.241 --> 35:16.418
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I totally forgot
what time it is.

35:16.462 --> 35:17.637
I have to go.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.161
-Big date?
-The biggest! It's game night.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.557
You should come.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.385
Uh, nah.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.430
-You know, I'm not very good
at games.
-That doesn't matter, it's--

35:28.474 --> 35:33.261
-Besides, I have dinner
waiting for me, so--
-No!

35:33.305 --> 35:35.176
-Mmm-mmm?
-Uh-uh.

35:35.220 --> 35:40.964
Under no circumstances
will I let you stay here
and eat that...

35:41.008 --> 35:43.445
-Well, that's the saddest
sandwich I've ever seen.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.533
Come on.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.056
-No! That stays.
-Okay.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.497
Is there not a game night
that you should be attending?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.803
Oh, there is.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.850
But I don't really stand
much of a chance without
my Trivial Pursuitpartner.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.681
Sadly, I cannot partake.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.466
J'onn has asked me to upgrade
the diagnostic system.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.989
No, he didn't.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.296
Brainy.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.211
What is going on? Hmm?

36:10.255 --> 36:13.823
Dude, I saw the way
that you looked at Nia,
when the tigers attacked.

36:13.867 --> 36:17.000
That fear of losing someone
that you love. I've had
that same look on my face

36:17.044 --> 36:18.524
since I got to this time.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.047
So, tell me the truth.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.615
I...

36:23.616 --> 36:24.965
have lied...

36:26.706 --> 36:28.316
to everyone...

36:30.275 --> 36:31.580
because I'd...

36:35.280 --> 36:37.369
I've had to work
with Lex Luthor.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.674
I helped Lex

36:38.718 --> 36:39.936
bring you back

36:39.980 --> 36:42.025
for the sake of the future.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.464
-That was you? You--
-Winn--

36:45.507 --> 36:49.598
-No, no, you risked my life.
-I...

36:49.642 --> 36:52.688
-Brainy, my family!
-I had to, I...

36:52.732 --> 36:56.039
It was imperative
that Lex get information

36:57.302 --> 36:58.738
from the memory cube

36:58.781 --> 37:00.130
on your ship.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.306
I did the calculations.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.785
I knew no one would die.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.613
That we would catch Toyman,
the...

37:04.657 --> 37:08.791
The one thing I didn't account
for was Lex himself.
He's, he's...

37:08.835 --> 37:12.012
chaos incarnate.
He's completely unpredictable,
and I...

37:14.014 --> 37:15.711
I don't know
if I can control him.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.193
Winn, I...

37:20.499 --> 37:23.153
I'm so sorry.

37:23.197 --> 37:27.288
Another Brainiac told me
that it was absolutely critical

37:27.332 --> 37:29.986
that I help Lex
in complete secrecy.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.859
But I hate it.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.515
I hurt Nia.

37:38.473 --> 37:42.869
And all I want is to be
close with her again, but...

37:43.739 --> 37:45.872
I have to be cold.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.572
And...

37:50.616 --> 37:55.534
I'm terrified
that I'm becoming the bad guy.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.885
You must hate me.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.366
You're right.

38:04.151 --> 38:05.457
I should hate you.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.676
But...

38:07.720 --> 38:10.418
everything worked out, so...

38:12.986 --> 38:14.335
I guess I don't.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.906
In fact...

38:23.213 --> 38:25.390
In a way, you kinda helped me.

38:25.433 --> 38:29.698
Growing up,
I was constantly burdened
by my father's crimes.

38:29.742 --> 38:33.049
You know, son of a madman.
Pretty sure everybody
judged me for it.

38:33.093 --> 38:36.662
Everything I've done in my life
has been in defiance of that.
Joining the super friends,

38:36.705 --> 38:39.055
running out to the future
with Legionnaires to

38:39.099 --> 38:40.622
fight your cousin and stop him.

38:43.973 --> 38:44.974
But all that kinda...

38:46.324 --> 38:47.673
pales in comparison to

38:48.891 --> 38:50.240
saving my own future.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.679
Plus, I got to see
some old friends.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.378
You still consider me a...

38:57.422 --> 38:58.727
an old friend?

38:58.771 --> 39:00.163
Yes,

39:00.207 --> 39:02.209
Brainy. I do.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.998
Oh, shoot.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.349
I'm running late. Uh, you sure
you don't wanna come?

39:13.655 --> 39:14.961
I have work to do.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.239
Pick it up.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.327
Press the button.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.339
Now, think of what you want.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.781
Q-waves.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.827
As promised.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.611
They do exist on this Earth.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.961
All we had to do was
bring them to this time.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.223
Happy birthday, Christmas,

40:00.267 --> 40:01.573
and New Year, little sis.

40:01.616 --> 40:04.663
-Thank you for going to Andrea

40:04.706 --> 40:05.881
today.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.579
What are partners for?

40:07.622 --> 40:10.843
If only Mother could see
how nicely we're playing
together now.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.802
Let's not ruin the streak.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.246
- Ohh!

40:27.773 --> 40:29.644
I don't know how
she's doing it,
but she's cheating.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.733
- Check her sleeves.
I saw something.
-Wait.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.822
Aw, there's our girl.
She's feeling better.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.215
But, like, for real this time.

40:35.258 --> 40:36.608
A lot better than you
at Jenga.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.786
-Okay, well, wait,
'cause it's my turn now.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.484
Ready, set...

40:43.528 --> 40:45.312
- She's terrible.
- Go!

40:45.355 --> 40:46.792
- She's terrible.
She's terrible.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.533
Ohh...

40:51.057 --> 40:52.754
-Dude!

40:52.798 --> 40:55.061
The point is for the tower
not to fall, am I wrong?

40:55.104 --> 40:56.671
Marty, is this how you play
in Metropolis?

40:56.715 --> 40:58.934
- No!
-Love your glasses, by the way.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.675
Thank you! These,
they're prescription.

41:00.719 --> 41:01.850
Yes.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.722
And those are the rules, but,

41:03.765 --> 41:08.117
uh, we play that if it falls,
we take a shot,
so I'm just gonna...

41:10.424 --> 41:12.034
Wait, wait, wait.
A toast, a toast.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.515
To new friends.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.778
- Aw.
- Welcome.

41:16.822 --> 41:19.694
And to old friends.
May they always find their way
back to us.

41:19.738 --> 41:22.436
-Aw!
- Cheers!

41:30.096 --> 41:31.532
That's the last
of Toyman's evidence.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.186
Let's lock it up
for the night.

41:43.805 --> 41:46.547
Let's play to win!
