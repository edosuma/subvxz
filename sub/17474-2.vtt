10:51.910 --> 10:54.912
Well we don't
know that yet, do we?

10:58.939 --> 11:03.027
You know, Ellis,
your help is fantastic, but...

11:03.028 --> 11:05.923
I kind of need to be
more alone in this space

11:05.924 --> 11:07.740
with tom around the structure.

11:07.741 --> 11:09.593
Oh, of course.
I just...

11:09.594 --> 11:12.662
I get so excited watching
my idea just come to life.

11:12.663 --> 11:14.080
[Chuckles]

11:14.081 --> 11:15.665
Eh... yeah, you know,

11:15.666 --> 11:17.125
a lot of people think

11:17.126 --> 11:18.768
that something
that is said in passing

11:18.769 --> 11:21.438
is the same thing
as an idea,

11:21.439 --> 11:23.089
which isn't strictly true.

11:23.090 --> 11:24.906
I-I don't think anything,
I...

11:24.907 --> 11:26.301
Totally understandable.

11:26.302 --> 11:28.553
But we're the ones that
have to do all the work.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.596
And you are tom's assistant,

11:30.597 --> 11:33.349
which is what tom
needs you to be...

11:33.350 --> 11:35.784
Right, tom?

11:35.785 --> 11:38.688
Absolutely.

11:38.689 --> 11:41.607
So maybe you can

11:41.608 --> 11:43.318
just give us a little room.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.069
I'll go pick up
the dry cleaning.

11:45.070 --> 11:47.027
Terrific.

11:51.867 --> 11:53.828
He's a really good
assistant.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.535
For the first time
in my life,

11:55.536 --> 11:57.623
- my closets are organized.
- Organizing closets.

11:57.624 --> 11:59.306
Hey, you know what?
That would be

11:59.307 --> 12:01.461
a great idea
for a musical too!

12:01.976 --> 12:03.644
Has anyone heard from Derek

12:03.645 --> 12:04.878
about how the work sessions
are going?

12:04.879 --> 12:06.215
I haven't talked to him.

12:06.216 --> 12:07.781
Five, six, seven, eight.

12:07.782 --> 12:09.816
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

12:09.817 --> 12:11.304
Oh, again!

12:11.305 --> 12:13.719
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,

12:13.720 --> 12:16.989
- five, six, and seven, eight.
- Oh, again!

12:16.990 --> 12:19.604
Five, six, seven
and one, two, three, four,

12:19.605 --> 12:20.772
five, six, seven, eight.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.358
Concentrate, please!

12:23.359 --> 12:25.531
It's just
it's pretty intense.

12:25.532 --> 12:27.532
Yeah, it's supposed to be.
Look, the gesture goes

12:27.533 --> 12:29.447
all the way to the end
of the fingertips,

12:29.448 --> 12:31.803
and then the chin comes up.

12:32.199 --> 12:34.806
Josh, show her the combination
<i>again,</i> please.

12:37.176 --> 12:38.539
Hey.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.412
Sorry. We've been
running a little late.

12:40.413 --> 12:42.246
That's all right.

12:42.247 --> 12:43.880
Oh, how is that?

12:43.881 --> 12:45.482
Oh, this one a actually
really good

12:45.483 --> 12:47.984
about the Arthur Miller-
Elia Kazan stuff.

12:47.985 --> 12:49.753
Not so good on the movies,

12:49.754 --> 12:51.677
but there's so much of that
in some of the other ones,

12:51.678 --> 12:53.324
I don't really miss it.

12:53.325 --> 12:54.472
How many have you read?

12:54.473 --> 12:56.092
A lot.

12:56.093 --> 12:58.494
- And the movies?
- [Laughs]

12:58.495 --> 12:59.685
All of them.

12:59.686 --> 13:02.146
Come on,
<i>clash by night?</i>

13:02.147 --> 13:03.689
Even <i>monkey business.</i>

13:03.690 --> 13:05.234
[Both laugh]

13:05.235 --> 13:07.236
Listen, um...

13:07.237 --> 13:09.238
I really appreciate you
doing this.

13:09.239 --> 13:11.072
I understand
it's a lot to ask.

13:11.073 --> 13:13.943
You know, after the demo
and the dance sequence,

13:13.944 --> 13:16.211
not to mention
the two auditions.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.547
It's Marilyn.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.873
I didn't expect it
to be simple.

13:20.874 --> 13:23.626
One, two, three,
four, five, and...

13:23.627 --> 13:25.670
Come on in.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.557
And one, two, three,
four, five,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.858
six, seven,
and one, two, three, four, five,

13:30.859 --> 13:32.059
and seven, eight.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.886
One, two, three, four, five...

13:33.887 --> 13:35.563
Okay, everyone,
we're done.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.398
Let's call it a day.

13:43.186 --> 13:45.815
Karen. Come here.

13:47.207 --> 13:49.709
I'm sure you two
would like to meet.

13:49.710 --> 13:52.211
Ivy Lynn,
this is Karen Cartwright.

13:52.212 --> 13:54.714
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, yeah, hi!

13:54.715 --> 13:57.160
So great to meet you.

13:57.161 --> 13:58.918
I love your scarf.

13:58.919 --> 14:01.372
Thanks. My mom gave it to me
for my birthday.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.583
Oh... it's so cute.

14:05.124 --> 14:07.158
Okay. Well,
I'll see you Wednesday.

14:07.159 --> 14:08.727
- Absolutely.
- Bye.

14:13.842 --> 14:15.467
Um...

14:18.388 --> 14:19.888
- I hate him.
- I thought you said

14:19.889 --> 14:21.723
- it was going well.
- He's a psychopath.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.406
- Why? What's he doing?
- He's messing with my head.

14:24.407 --> 14:26.102
He brought in the girl,
the other girl up for the part,

14:26.103 --> 14:28.324
and he was like, [Accent]
"Oh, hello, I'm sure you two

14:28.325 --> 14:30.735
- would like to meet each other."
- He's a Brit?

14:30.736 --> 14:32.320
Of course he's a brit.
I told you that.

14:32.321 --> 14:33.821
No, no,
you didn't, actually.

14:33.822 --> 14:35.122
Well, it's not important.

14:35.123 --> 14:37.024
What's important
is he's a creep.

14:37.025 --> 14:38.626
Well, get used to it.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.194
What is that supposed
to mean?

14:40.195 --> 14:42.163
Well, it means there are
a lot of guys out there

14:42.164 --> 14:44.131
with a lot of power,
and they're hard to deal with,

14:44.132 --> 14:45.565
so you should
get used to it.

14:45.566 --> 14:47.000
I don't wanna get used to it.

14:47.001 --> 14:48.968
Then you create
your own suffering.

14:48.969 --> 14:50.504
I am not creating
my own suffering.

14:50.505 --> 14:52.839
He is creating my suffering.

14:54.409 --> 14:56.677
Your British accent's
terrible, by the way.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.805
- Marilyn's not British.
- Yeah, well, good thing too.

14:59.806 --> 15:02.181
Hey, listen, we've been invited
to dinner this Wednesday.

15:02.182 --> 15:04.550
- Who with?
- One of the deputy mayors.

15:04.551 --> 15:06.151
- Ooh!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:06.152 --> 15:08.554
They're thinking about
promoting me, actually.

15:08.555 --> 15:09.922
Awesome!

15:09.923 --> 15:11.824
- Then you'll be powerful too.
- Yeah.

15:11.825 --> 15:13.986
- And very hard to deal with.
- Mm...

15:13.987 --> 15:17.495
[As Marilyn]
Thank you ever so.

15:17.496 --> 15:19.597
Thank you ever so.

15:19.598 --> 15:22.099
Okay.
That's a little spooky.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.664
She does this thing
with her lips...

15:24.665 --> 15:27.572
The top lip doesn't move
with the bottom one.

15:27.573 --> 15:28.740
[Breathy gasp]

15:28.741 --> 15:30.675
Thank you ever so.

15:30.676 --> 15:32.004
Okay,
you're freaking me out.

15:32.005 --> 15:33.881
How are you doing that?

15:33.882 --> 15:35.846
[Breathy laugh]

15:35.847 --> 15:38.761
[Continues giggling]

15:38.762 --> 15:40.346
Stop it!

15:40.347 --> 15:42.118
[Both laughing]

15:42.119 --> 15:43.224
Hmm.

15:43.225 --> 15:45.922
Great. Yeah.

15:45.923 --> 15:47.558
Thank you, Rene.

15:47.559 --> 15:48.792
I'll... I'll get right on this.

15:48.793 --> 15:50.560
Bye.

15:50.561 --> 15:52.928
What was that?
Umum...

15:52.929 --> 15:55.736
Meetings for our group
start Friday.

15:56.066 --> 15:59.268
We need...
To write a short letter

15:59.269 --> 16:02.238
to the birth mother
of our child.

16:02.239 --> 16:03.706
Obviously,
she'll never get it,

16:03.707 --> 16:05.830
because the babies
are abandoned

16:05.831 --> 16:07.208
and our daughter,
let's face it,

16:07.209 --> 16:08.877
isn't even born yet,
but...

16:08.878 --> 16:11.045
Something they ask you to do
to get people...

16:11.046 --> 16:13.482
Engaged in the process.

16:13.483 --> 16:15.417
Okay?

16:17.257 --> 16:18.653
What?

16:23.805 --> 16:26.927
What?

16:26.928 --> 16:28.496
I just... I just think
we need to be

16:28.497 --> 16:32.099
more realistic about this.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.232
Meaning what?

16:33.233 --> 16:34.802
[Sighs]

16:34.803 --> 16:38.505
Their most conservative
estimate... two years.

16:38.506 --> 16:41.107
I'll be 47
when that baby comes.

16:41.108 --> 16:42.617
Well, I mean...

16:42.618 --> 16:47.246
Which would make me 65
when she graduated High School.

16:48.982 --> 16:51.751
So what, you don't want
to do this anymore?

16:56.589 --> 16:58.424
I'm sorry.

16:58.425 --> 17:01.260
- Well, that's just great.
- Okay, first of all,

17:01.261 --> 17:03.328
you should not be
eavesdropping.

17:03.329 --> 17:05.723
It's the only way I find
anything out around here.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.724
- That is completely unfair.
- Oh, yeah,

17:07.726 --> 17:10.185
you're just ready to tank
the whole thing,

17:10.186 --> 17:11.686
- and I'm the one who sucks.
- Let me.

17:13.000 --> 17:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:30.521 --> 17:32.456
So I don't get a vote.

17:32.457 --> 17:34.390
- It's just over.
- No one is saying that.

17:34.391 --> 17:36.295
He said it.
Dad said it.

17:39.997 --> 17:43.165
Your father has been anxious
about this for a long time, Leo.

17:43.166 --> 17:45.233
People say things
when they're anxious.

17:45.234 --> 17:47.736
- Yeah, like, "I quit."
- That's not what we're saying.

17:47.737 --> 17:50.806
Mom, we've been talking
about this forever.

17:50.807 --> 17:52.908
Ever since I was a little kid,

17:52.909 --> 17:55.523
you told me I'd be getting
a brother or sister.

17:55.524 --> 17:57.846
- We did say that.
- You just told me

17:57.847 --> 18:00.482
I had to wait,
and then you said...

18:00.483 --> 18:02.517
You said my sister
is in China.

18:02.518 --> 18:04.490
She's waiting for us
in China.

18:04.491 --> 18:06.988
And I believed you.
Why wouldn't I believe you?

18:06.989 --> 18:08.411
You told me.

18:08.412 --> 18:12.164
She's waiting for us
to come and get her.

18:12.165 --> 18:16.229
What is gonna happen to her
if we don't go get her?

18:20.839 --> 18:22.842
- Good show.
- Bye. Thank you.

18:22.843 --> 18:25.205
- Hmm.
- Good night.

18:25.206 --> 18:27.513
I hope Derek's
not too hideous.

18:27.514 --> 18:29.682
He's very professional.

18:29.683 --> 18:32.578
If he steps out of line,
let me know?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.603
Ohh.
My own Johnny Hyde.

18:34.604 --> 18:37.356
- Who's Johnny Hyde?
- Marilyn's first agent.

18:37.357 --> 18:39.051
He adored her.

18:39.052 --> 18:41.521
He was very protective,
and then he died tragically,

18:41.522 --> 18:43.288
and her career
totally tanked.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.030
You don't know
who Johnny Hyde is?

18:45.031 --> 18:48.159
I do. I just like listening
to you talk about Marilyn.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.702
[Laughs]

18:52.464 --> 18:55.634
I would have just
given it to you.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.251
I know.

19:01.171 --> 19:03.641
[Dinner music]

19:03.642 --> 19:05.776
Eileen.

19:08.713 --> 19:09.764
Hello, Jerry.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.891
Wow. You're Eileen rand.

19:11.892 --> 19:13.918
Wow. You are such
a great producer.

19:13.919 --> 19:17.320
- Hi. I'm Lindsey Mullens.
- We've met.

19:17.321 --> 19:20.566
- I don't think so.
- I do.

19:23.427 --> 19:25.762
- You all right?
- Absolutely.

19:25.763 --> 19:27.072
How's it going?

19:27.073 --> 19:30.433
Well, Ivy's terrific.

19:30.434 --> 19:32.745
She's a perfectionist.

19:34.671 --> 19:37.739
If I'm gonna sink $200,000,
in this workshop,

19:37.740 --> 19:40.642
I need to know
the girl can carry it.

19:40.643 --> 19:42.744
Too perfect
I can live with.

19:42.745 --> 19:44.298
Yeah, she's trying
too hard.

19:46.649 --> 19:48.761
What about the new girl?

19:48.762 --> 19:50.137
excellent.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.223
Green doesn't even
beginning to it.

19:52.224 --> 19:55.322
Well, Marilyn was green
at the beginning.

19:55.323 --> 19:57.157
You don't say.
I don't know.

19:57.158 --> 20:00.561
Maybe neither of them's
right for it.

20:00.562 --> 20:02.362
Maybe...

20:02.363 --> 20:04.398
Scarlett Johansson's movie'll
fall through.

20:04.399 --> 20:05.799
Get it out of your head.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.667
We're not chasing stars
on this one.

20:07.668 --> 20:09.865
We're casting Marilyn
on Friday.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.909
Eileen, Derek.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.536
- Hi, Jordan.
- Hey, Jordan.

20:13.537 --> 20:14.912
Can I borrow him
a second?

20:14.913 --> 20:16.509
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.457
- Not too long.
- I know.

20:23.670 --> 20:25.684
Have I given you
any indication

20:25.685 --> 20:27.519
that I have any interest
in speaking with you

20:27.520 --> 20:29.421
ever again?

20:29.422 --> 20:32.992
Can I have a Manhattan?
She'll have one too.

20:32.993 --> 20:34.326
So...

34:38.230 --> 34:40.465
Nope.
Information we have.

34:40.466 --> 34:43.446
I thought Karen's dancing
was good.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.364
She might be green,
but she's certainly trained.

34:45.366 --> 34:47.492
- She's a star.
- Well, you can't say that

34:47.493 --> 34:49.577
until it happens,
but it could happen, yes.

34:49.578 --> 34:51.621
Ivy was incredible.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.710
- She was.
- I thought she was

34:53.710 --> 34:56.079
completely spontususus
and sexy.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.881
Yes, she is that and more.

34:57.882 --> 34:59.504
She's intelligent,
she's passionate.

34:59.505 --> 35:01.506
She's beautiful.

35:01.507 --> 35:02.819
I thought her reading
of the new pages

35:02.820 --> 35:04.843
was pitch-perfect.

35:04.844 --> 35:07.178
Was it too perfect?

35:07.179 --> 35:09.806
Yeah, I dunno.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.726
There's a lonelys there,
a wound that...

35:12.727 --> 35:14.728
Was heart-breaking, really.

35:14.729 --> 35:16.354
[Sighs]

35:16.355 --> 35:18.367
And Karen is more of
an innocent,

35:18.368 --> 35:21.270
which is also good
for Marilyn.

35:23.373 --> 35:24.696
So?

35:24.697 --> 35:26.908
They getting anywhere?

35:26.909 --> 35:28.616
Not yet.

35:28.617 --> 35:30.612
Any word yet?

35:30.613 --> 35:32.447
I'm about to crawl
out of my skin.

35:32.448 --> 35:34.247
Oh...

35:34.248 --> 35:36.451
- Nothing yet?
- Not a word.

35:36.452 --> 35:38.886
- This is awful.
- I know.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.628
Night, you guys.

35:40.629 --> 35:42.464
Night.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.694
- You okay?
- I don't want to talk about it.

35:46.695 --> 35:48.729
I can't believe
it's going on like this.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.297
I don't want
to talk about it.

35:50.298 --> 35:54.067
Ivy.
Hi.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.102
I wanted to come

35:56.103 --> 35:58.104
and tell you in person.

35:58.105 --> 36:00.906
I didn't get it.

36:00.907 --> 36:02.908
God, I didn't get it.
It's okay.

36:02.909 --> 36:04.819
It's okay, tom.
I just have to get outta here.

36:04.820 --> 36:07.906
Ivy, stop!

36:07.907 --> 36:10.550
You got it.

36:10.551 --> 36:12.327
I got it?

36:12.328 --> 36:13.995
You're Marilyn.

36:13.996 --> 36:15.747
Oh, my God, I got it!

36:15.748 --> 36:18.625
[Laughter, chatter]

36:20.660 --> 36:21.827
Are you all right?

36:21.828 --> 36:23.795
I don't know what to do.

36:23.796 --> 36:25.731
I don't know what to do!

36:27.716 --> 36:30.512
[Laughter]

36:30.513 --> 36:35.005
So you feel good
about our choice?

36:35.006 --> 36:37.641
If I didn't, I wouldn't
have gone along with it.

36:37.642 --> 36:40.104
She's a very talented
young lady.

36:40.105 --> 36:43.781
- And lucky.
- We're all lucky.

36:43.782 --> 36:46.349
And the Cartwright girl,
maybe not so much.

36:46.350 --> 36:48.618
That's true.

36:48.619 --> 36:50.532
But I'd keep my eye
on that one.

36:56.694 --> 37:00.363
Eileen, I need to talk
to you about something.

37:00.364 --> 37:01.668
Yes?

37:05.835 --> 37:09.538
I, uh...

37:09.539 --> 37:13.375
I don't want it getting
back to you in a bad way.

37:17.145 --> 37:20.515
Jerry's picked up the option
on <i>my fair lady.</i>

37:20.516 --> 37:23.851
He did?

37:23.852 --> 37:26.387
Yeah. He wants me
back on board.

37:29.024 --> 37:33.616
You know, I spent three years
of my life on that production.

37:33.617 --> 37:36.162
- That's a lot of work
- mm.

37:38.287 --> 37:41.468
So I, uh...

37:41.469 --> 37:45.044
Basically went ahead
and told him to, uh,

37:45.045 --> 37:47.340
shove it.

37:47.341 --> 37:49.215
You did?

37:49.216 --> 37:51.843
Yeah.

37:51.844 --> 37:54.178
Call me crazy,
but I kinda like <i>Marilyn.</i>

37:55.816 --> 38:00.085
She is not the American
Eliza Doolittle at all.

38:00.086 --> 38:02.755
She's much more
interesting than that.

38:02.756 --> 38:06.024
I certainly think so.

38:06.025 --> 38:08.443
It also helps you reasier
on the eye than Jerry.

38:10.402 --> 38:12.280
See you tomorrow.

38:15.434 --> 38:17.435
[Sniffles]
Whew.

38:20.079 --> 38:22.706
Hey, I just heard
that it's a special night

38:22.707 --> 38:24.918
for one of our friends.

38:24.919 --> 38:28.379
Ivy Lynn just landed
a big gig playing Marilyn Monroe

38:28.380 --> 38:30.173
in a new musical
headed for Broadway.

38:30.174 --> 38:31.949
Come on, Ivy,
how 'bout a song?

38:31.950 --> 38:32.926
Oh, no.

38:32.927 --> 38:34.084
[Chanting]
Ivy, Ivy,

38:34.085 --> 38:37.353
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy!

38:39.932 --> 38:42.477
Okay. Would anyone else
like to share their letter?

38:47.064 --> 38:49.567
I-I guess I can.

38:54.436 --> 38:57.367
"To the birth mother
of my daughter.

38:57.368 --> 39:01.242
"Our lives are so far distant
from each other,

39:01.243 --> 39:04.958
"it is as if
neither of us exists.

39:04.959 --> 39:07.649
"I will never know you,

39:07.650 --> 39:09.416
"even though you may
give birth to her,

39:09.417 --> 39:12.887
"my daughter may never
know you as well.

39:12.888 --> 39:17.090
"But I want you to know
I will guard her like a lion.

39:17.636 --> 39:20.060
"I will raise her with love,

39:20.061 --> 39:23.631
"I will protect her from
the wounds of loneliness.

39:23.632 --> 39:25.932
"She will be a child
of two lands,

39:25.933 --> 39:29.669
"and she will wear
that knowledge with pride.

39:30.149 --> 39:33.506
"And at night, we will call
to you on the wind

39:33.507 --> 39:37.109
"and perhaps
you will hear us and know

39:37.110 --> 39:40.034
she is safe."

39:41.347 --> 39:42.412
Sorry.

39:42.413 --> 39:44.414
Uh...

39:44.415 --> 39:47.417
I thought
I couldn't make it.

39:47.418 --> 39:50.753
But, uh...

39:52.792 --> 39:54.693
Then I decided
I couldn't miss it.

39:54.694 --> 39:57.327
Well, we were just
reading the letters

39:57.328 --> 39:58.511
that people have written.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.179
And she wrote
the best one.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.974
I wish I had
written that one.
