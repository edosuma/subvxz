WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.107
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.245 --> 00:07.214
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.352 --> 00:11.839
To a deluxe apartment
In the sky

00:11.977 --> 00:14.842
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.980 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.849
We've finally got
A piece of the pie

00:23.540 --> 00:26.129
Fish don't fry
In the kitchen

00:26.267 --> 00:28.752
Beans don't burn
On the grill

00:28.890 --> 00:31.238
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.376 --> 00:34.103
Just to get up that hill

00:34.241 --> 00:36.588
Now we're up
In the big leagues

00:36.726 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live
It's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin'
Wrong with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.184
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.322 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.812
To a deluxe apartment
In the sky

00:53.950 --> 00:56.711
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.849 --> 00:59.818
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.956 --> 01:04.650
We've finally got
A piece of the pie

01:11.416 --> 01:12.727
Pass the salt.

01:14.004 --> 01:16.006
Pass the salt what?

01:16.145 --> 01:17.456
Pass the salt, Weezy.

01:20.701 --> 01:22.668
Haven't you
forgotten something?

01:22.806 --> 01:24.360
Oh, yeah!
Pass the pepper too.

01:27.673 --> 01:30.366
When you ask for something,
it's nice to say "please."

01:30.504 --> 01:31.919
Don't you have any manners?

01:32.057 --> 01:33.817
Manners?
Manners are for strangers.

01:33.955 --> 01:35.992
I don't need no manners
in my own house.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.788
Then treat me like a stranger
and say "please."

01:38.926 --> 01:41.894
Okay, please get off
my case and give me
the salt and pepper.

01:48.556 --> 01:49.764
Well?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.007
Well, what?

01:51.145 --> 01:52.974
I didn't hear
a "thank you."

01:53.113 --> 01:54.390
That's because
I didn't say one.

01:56.875 --> 01:57.876
George...

01:58.014 --> 01:59.291
Weezy,
there's lots of times

01:59.429 --> 02:00.637
you don't say
thank you to me.

02:01.224 --> 02:02.432
Like when?

02:03.261 --> 02:05.125
Like last night.

02:13.581 --> 02:15.273
Me say "thank you"?

02:15.411 --> 02:17.447
You should have said,
"Excuse me."

02:23.902 --> 02:26.042
Oh, that's
telling him, Mom!

02:26.180 --> 02:29.183
Don't you know it's impolite
to talk with your mouth full?

02:29.321 --> 02:31.254
Would you like another
slice of ham, Lionel?

02:31.392 --> 02:33.222
No, thanks, Mom.
I'm not really hungry.

02:34.050 --> 02:35.741
Come on, Lionel.
You better eat.

02:35.879 --> 02:37.295
Your mother
invited you over

02:37.433 --> 02:39.469
so you could get
a good home-cooked
meal for a change.

02:39.607 --> 02:42.783
Oh, George. I'll bet
Jenny is a wonderful cook.

02:42.921 --> 02:44.681
Oh, yeah? How much
you wanna bet?

02:46.580 --> 02:47.719
She can't cook, huh?

02:47.857 --> 02:49.721
She's learning fast,
though.

02:49.859 --> 02:51.585
I hope she learns faster
than your mother did.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.866
When we first got married,
the only thing she could fix
was fried chicken.

02:57.004 --> 02:59.317
I ate so much chicken
I thought
I was growing feathers.

03:01.698 --> 03:04.356
Maybe that's why you still
lay so many eggs.

03:06.669 --> 03:09.672
Mom, you know Jenny and I
have almost been married
for two months now,

03:09.810 --> 03:11.605
and I don't think we've had
the same meal twice.

03:11.743 --> 03:13.883
Well, what about leftovers?

03:14.021 --> 03:15.850
Oh, we never have leftovers.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.162
Jenny's too smart for that.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.199
She just cooks enough
for one meal.

03:19.337 --> 03:20.993
Well, my mother used to do
the same thing,

03:21.131 --> 03:23.030
but we didn't call it
"being smart,"

03:23.168 --> 03:24.859
we called it "being poor."

03:26.378 --> 03:27.828
Hey, Lionel, how's
your apartment coming?

03:27.966 --> 03:29.657
Got all your furniture yet?
Not quite.

03:29.795 --> 03:31.280
What have you got?

03:31.418 --> 03:33.454
A kitchen table,
two chairs and a bed.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.664
That's all?

03:36.802 --> 03:38.356
When you're newlyweds,
that's enough.

03:40.565 --> 03:42.291
I offered to
help her decorate,

03:42.429 --> 03:43.809
but she turned me down.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.155
Oh, now, you know Jenny.

03:45.294 --> 03:46.985
She likes to do things
her own way.

03:47.123 --> 03:50.091
I wouldn't have stopped her
from doing things her way.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.473
I'd just tell her
when she was wrong.

03:53.405 --> 03:54.993
Okay, Mom. I'll talk to her.

03:56.063 --> 03:57.858
You know, you and Jenny
are very lucky

03:57.996 --> 03:59.204
to have a place of your own.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.484
When we were first married,
your father and I
had to live with his mother.

04:03.622 --> 04:06.280
Mmm, that drove me crazy.

04:06.418 --> 04:07.902
Weezy and Mama
was always fighting.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.732
They weren't as close
as they are now.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.704
Hello, Mrs. Jefferson,
ma'am.

04:16.842 --> 04:18.465
I came up
just as soon as I got
your husband's message.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.674
Hey, Ralph! Come on in!
Yes, sir!

04:20.812 --> 04:23.228
I want you to do me a favor.
Yes, sir!

04:23.366 --> 04:25.023
As long as I have
to work on Sunday,

04:25.161 --> 04:27.750
and since I can't
spend the day in church,

04:27.888 --> 04:30.131
I might as well do something
nice for my favorite tenant.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.548
Oh! Here.
Why, thank you, sir.

04:32.686 --> 04:34.722
Wait, wait, wait!
That ain't a tip,
that's my mother's address.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.448
I want you to grab a cab
and go pick her up.

04:36.586 --> 04:37.691
Yes, sir.

04:37.829 --> 04:41.488
Ah, that looks beautiful.

04:41.626 --> 04:43.697
Ralph, would you care
for a bite before you go?

04:43.835 --> 04:45.768
No, I couldn't,
Mrs. Jefferson.

04:45.906 --> 04:46.907
No, he couldn't.

04:47.045 --> 04:48.391
He can't keep Mama
waiting all day.

04:48.529 --> 04:51.912
What I meant, sir,
is I'm on a very strict
food program.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.223
You mean a diet?

04:53.362 --> 04:56.192
I mean the Milton Center
for Weight Control.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.125
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

04:58.263 --> 04:59.678
They give you
electric shock treatment

04:59.816 --> 05:01.577
to make you stop eating
certain foods, right?

05:01.715 --> 05:04.683
Right. And the worst shock
is when they hit you
with the bill.

05:06.478 --> 05:09.101
You mean you're paying
someone to give you
electric shocks?

05:09.239 --> 05:10.413
Oh, yes, ma'am!

05:10.551 --> 05:11.897
You see, what they try to do

05:12.035 --> 05:16.108
is make eating
a very unpleasant experience.

05:16.246 --> 05:18.110
That's what Jenny's trying
to do to you, huh, Lionel?

05:21.251 --> 05:23.253
Now, take this piece of pie,
for example.

05:23.392 --> 05:25.877
Now, pumpkin pie
has always been
a problem for me.

05:26.015 --> 05:27.292
But now they've
got me programmed

05:27.430 --> 05:30.606
to be completely turned off
and disgusted by it.

05:30.744 --> 05:32.780
But that's not pumpkin.
It's sweet potato.

05:32.918 --> 05:34.679
Oh. Then I can have some.

05:38.821 --> 05:40.443
We haven't gotten
around to this yet.

05:41.858 --> 05:43.273
Ralph, don't you have
something to do?

05:43.412 --> 05:44.413
Yes, sir.

05:46.829 --> 05:48.071
Right away, sir.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.628
Has the program made
any difference
in your weight?

05:52.766 --> 05:54.388
Oh, yes, ma'am.

05:54.526 --> 05:56.425
So far I've gained 7 pounds.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.501
Do you think
your mother should
go out with her bad foot?

06:03.639 --> 06:05.192
Well, she can't go out
and leave it at home.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.164
How did Grandma
break her ankle anyway?

06:12.302 --> 06:14.028
See, when I asked her,
she wouldn't tell me.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.996
That's because
she's too embarrassed.

06:16.134 --> 06:18.239
And why would
she be embarrassed about
breaking her ankle?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.518
Because she broke it
while playing bingo.

06:22.312 --> 06:23.486
Playing bingo?

06:23.624 --> 06:24.556
Yes.

06:24.694 --> 06:26.282
She won the jackpot,

06:26.420 --> 06:28.457
and then she jumped up
and yelled,

06:28.595 --> 06:32.702
"The good Lord smiles
on those he loves."

06:32.840 --> 06:35.118
And while he was
still smiling,

06:35.256 --> 06:37.880
she tripped over her handbag
and broke her ankle.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.021
From now on,
when Mama plays bingo,

06:41.159 --> 06:42.402
she'd better wear
a seatbelt.

06:43.748 --> 06:45.646
Hey, Pop, how's she
managing all alone

06:45.784 --> 06:48.028
if she's
stuck in a wheelchair and
her foot's in a cast?

06:48.166 --> 06:49.236
Well, it's easy.

06:49.374 --> 06:50.444
Some of the ladies
from her church

06:50.582 --> 06:51.859
are taking turns
helping out.

06:51.997 --> 06:53.551
I went to see her yesterday.

06:53.689 --> 06:56.933
The weather was so nice
I wanted to take her out
in her wheelchair,

06:57.071 --> 06:58.418
but she wouldn't let me.

06:58.556 --> 06:59.591
Why not?

06:59.729 --> 07:01.662
She said, "Oh, no, Louise.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.009
"You're not gonna
push me around."

07:05.563 --> 07:07.323
That sounds just like Mom.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.601
I wish they'd put a cast
on her tongue.

07:12.811 --> 07:13.985
Mom!

07:14.123 --> 07:15.365
You know something, Weezy?

07:15.504 --> 07:16.919
I'm about ready for some
of that sweet potato pie.

07:17.057 --> 07:18.610
Oh! How about you, Lionel?

07:18.748 --> 07:19.991
It's your favorite.

07:20.129 --> 07:21.958
Mmm, no, thanks, Mom.

07:22.096 --> 07:24.685
All of a sudden I don't
feel very hungry anymore.

07:24.823 --> 07:26.066
I'm really sorry.

07:26.204 --> 07:28.102
Don't be sorry, Lionel.
I'll be glad
to eat your share.

07:29.276 --> 07:31.451
Are you feeling all right?

07:31.589 --> 07:33.383
I'm just feeling
a little queasy,
that's all.

07:33.522 --> 07:34.695
Let me feel
your forehead.

07:34.833 --> 07:35.869
I think
you've got a fever.

07:36.007 --> 07:37.353
I'm gonna
take your temperature.

07:37.491 --> 07:38.527
Ma, you don't have to!

07:38.665 --> 07:39.666
Oh, yes, I do!

07:39.804 --> 07:41.530
One hothead in this house
is plenty.

07:43.428 --> 07:46.086
Lionel, you haven't been
working too hard, have you?

07:46.224 --> 07:47.294
No, Pop.

07:47.432 --> 07:49.192
I don't want you working
so hard you get sick.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.470
I won't, Pop.

07:50.608 --> 07:52.126
Because if you get sick,
you'll have to miss work.

07:56.199 --> 07:58.339
Okay, Lionel. Open up.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.377
Mom, you're not gonna put
that thermometer in my mouth.

08:02.309 --> 08:04.311
Well, you've got
one other choice.

08:12.112 --> 08:13.665
He doesn't look good.

08:13.803 --> 08:14.839
You wouldn't
look good either

08:14.977 --> 08:16.219
with that thing sticking
out of your face.

08:17.876 --> 08:19.119
Do you think I should
call a doctor?

08:19.257 --> 08:20.396
What for?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.294
All he's gonna say is
"Take two aspirins,

08:22.432 --> 08:24.780
"drink lots of liquids
and where should I
send the bill?"

08:25.677 --> 08:27.437
I'm worried.

08:27.576 --> 08:30.510
This is the same time
of year Lionel caught
pneumonia when he was nine.

08:30.648 --> 08:32.097
Oh, Weezy!

08:34.134 --> 08:35.100
Huh?

08:35.238 --> 08:36.170
What did you say?

08:37.965 --> 08:40.243
I told you not to talk
with your mouth full!

08:41.141 --> 08:42.970
I said I don't think
I have pneumonia.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.525
Well, you've
got something.

08:45.663 --> 08:47.112
Your temperature's
over 100.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.355
It is?

08:48.493 --> 08:49.839
Come on, Lionel.
I'm putting you to bed.

08:49.977 --> 08:52.739
No, Mom.
Don't argue with me!

08:52.877 --> 08:55.362
Mom, Jenny is coming here
right from the library.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.709
We'll go home and I'll
jump in bed, I promise.

08:57.847 --> 08:59.504
By that time
you might be dead.

08:59.642 --> 09:01.644
Mom, I am all right!

09:01.782 --> 09:03.128
Look, you've got a fever,

09:03.266 --> 09:05.510
and I'm gonna
put you to bed,
and that's that.

09:07.512 --> 09:08.962
You better do
like your mother says.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.860
If you don't let her
cure you, she'll kill you.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.107
Hi, Mr. Jefferson.
Oh, hi, Jenny.

09:16.245 --> 09:17.522
What are all
those books for?

09:17.660 --> 09:19.731
I got a heavy test tomorrow
in Black History.

09:19.869 --> 09:22.285
Ah! Well, you should get
half the answers right.

09:27.808 --> 09:28.913
You know something,
Mr. Jefferson?

09:29.051 --> 09:30.915
You got a wonderful
sense of humor.
Thank you.

09:31.053 --> 09:32.572
Why don't you try
using it sometime?

09:34.332 --> 09:36.748
Watch yourself,
young lady.

09:36.886 --> 09:38.508
Where's Lionel?
He's in bed.

09:38.647 --> 09:40.614
Oh, you mean
he went home already?

09:40.752 --> 09:42.305
No, he's here,
in his old room.

09:42.443 --> 09:44.929
Hi, Jenny!
Hi, Mrs. Jefferson.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.206
Why is Lionel in bed?

09:46.344 --> 09:48.588
Oh, he's got a fever
so I made him lie down.

09:48.726 --> 09:50.003
Oh, I better see
how he's feeling.

09:50.141 --> 09:51.211
Oh, not yet.

09:51.349 --> 09:52.281
Why not?

09:52.419 --> 09:53.523
He's getting undressed.

09:55.249 --> 09:56.457
So?

09:56.975 --> 09:58.736
Oh, I forgot!

10:01.221 --> 10:04.155
You're married now,
so I guess it's all right.

10:12.439 --> 10:15.649
Oh, how do you
feel, honey?

10:15.787 --> 10:18.548
Like an old tennis ball,
no bounce.

10:18.687 --> 10:19.964
Oh!

10:21.068 --> 10:23.174
Oh, he is warm!

10:23.312 --> 10:25.314
Well, come on, Lionel.
We better get you home.

10:25.452 --> 10:27.316
Home?

10:27.454 --> 10:30.664
You can't take him out
in this cold.
He'll catch pneumonia.

10:30.802 --> 10:31.941
He'll be all right,
Mrs. Jefferson.

10:32.079 --> 10:33.702
We're gonna grab a taxi
and be home in a flash.

10:33.840 --> 10:34.841
Come on, baby.

10:34.979 --> 10:36.843
Jenny!

10:36.981 --> 10:39.362
I think it's better
if he stays here.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.676
Will you two cut it out?
I feel like a yo-yo!

10:42.814 --> 10:44.920
The best place for him
is in his own home,

10:45.058 --> 10:46.369
where I can take care of him.

10:46.507 --> 10:48.095
Oh, now,
how you gonna do that?

10:48.233 --> 10:49.579
You go to school
during the day.

10:49.718 --> 10:51.374
I can take
a couple of days off.

10:51.512 --> 10:52.790
Oh, it's silly of you
to do that

10:52.928 --> 10:54.930
when I can
take care of him here.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.001
I'll put some clean sheets
on the bed,

10:57.139 --> 10:58.623
set up the vaporizer...

10:58.761 --> 11:01.419
Oh, but first, I've gotta get
the hot-water bottle

11:01.557 --> 11:03.317
and a pair of pajamas.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.354
Lionel doesn't wear
pajamas anymore.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.155
No wonder he got sick.

11:18.160 --> 11:21.128
All right. Get dressed
and let's go home.

11:21.266 --> 11:23.130
Oh, now,
wait a minute, Jenny.

11:23.268 --> 11:25.270
Let's talk about this
first, okay?

11:25.408 --> 11:26.651
Now, what is there
to talk about?

11:26.789 --> 11:28.480
I only wanna do
what's best for you.

11:28.618 --> 11:30.137
Well, so does Mom.

11:31.138 --> 11:32.381
Are you saying
you wanna stay here?

11:32.519 --> 11:33.554
I didn't say that.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.695
Well, then,
you want to go home.

11:36.661 --> 11:38.456
No, I didn't
say that either.

11:38.594 --> 11:39.699
You better
make up your mind.

11:39.837 --> 11:41.183
Do you wanna go home
where you belong

11:41.321 --> 11:42.909
or do you wanna stay here
with your mother?

11:43.047 --> 11:45.774
Jenny, I don't understand
why you're getting so upset.

11:45.912 --> 11:47.879
Well, it's just that
I'm your wife, honey,

11:48.017 --> 11:49.916
and taking care of you
is my responsibility.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.020
But, Jenny...

11:51.158 --> 11:52.815
Come on,
don't "but, Jenny" me!

11:52.953 --> 11:54.714
Now, are we gonna
go home or not?

11:54.852 --> 11:56.716
I mean, Mom is going
to all this trouble!

11:56.854 --> 11:59.097
All right, all right.
Stay here.

11:59.235 --> 12:02.549
You know,
I didn't marry a man.
I married a baby.

12:02.687 --> 12:03.792
First time
something goes wrong,

12:03.930 --> 12:05.414
he goes running home
to his mommy.

12:05.552 --> 12:06.829
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?

12:06.967 --> 12:08.486
Up to see my mother!

12:09.625 --> 12:10.868
Ohhh!

12:29.403 --> 12:30.888
Must you crunch
like that?

12:34.719 --> 12:35.996
Crunching is
half the fun.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.929
You don't know you're eating
them unless you crunch.

12:38.930 --> 12:40.932
The whole building
knows you're eating them.

12:42.623 --> 12:44.453
Helen!

12:44.591 --> 12:46.110
You're supposed
to crunch them.

12:46.248 --> 12:48.250
That's why they're
called Crunchos.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.805
Well, would you please
crunch them quietly?

12:51.943 --> 12:53.220
I'm trying to concentrate.

12:53.358 --> 12:55.084
You've been concentrating
for the last two minutes.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.535
You're running out of time.
Ha-ha-ha!

12:59.744 --> 13:00.641
Hi.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.574
Oh, hi, Jenny.

13:02.712 --> 13:04.335
To what do we owe
this pleasant surprise?

13:04.473 --> 13:06.440
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how you two were doing.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.753
I'm losing.
Ohh!

13:08.891 --> 13:11.066
How's Lionel?
I think he's got the flu.

13:11.204 --> 13:12.861
Oh, what a shame.
Is he home in bed?

13:12.999 --> 13:15.104
Yes and no.
Huh?

13:15.242 --> 13:17.279
He's in bed,
but he is not home.

13:17.417 --> 13:18.625
He's not in hospital,
is he?

13:18.763 --> 13:20.144
No. He's not that sick.

13:20.282 --> 13:22.215
Oi, but his mama
is acting like he is.

13:22.353 --> 13:23.319
What do you mean?

13:23.457 --> 13:25.390
Lionel is downstairs
in his old bed

13:25.528 --> 13:27.772
because his mother insists
on taking care of him.

13:27.910 --> 13:28.946
What do you
think about that?

13:29.084 --> 13:30.499
Super!

13:30.637 --> 13:31.776
What's super about it?

13:31.914 --> 13:34.848
That's my word:
S-U-P-E-R.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.230
Ah, let's see.

13:37.368 --> 13:40.095
That's six, 12,
a double word.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.890
Twenty-four points.

13:42.028 --> 13:43.512
Ha-ha-ha!

13:44.202 --> 13:45.894
I'm catching up, Helen!

13:50.622 --> 13:52.797
Daddy, don't you think
Lionel should go home
with me?

13:52.935 --> 13:55.041
After all, I'm his wife.
That's true.

13:55.179 --> 13:57.940
How long is it
gonna take his mama to
cut the apron strings?

13:58.078 --> 13:59.355
I don't know.

13:59.493 --> 14:01.910
When we got married,
Tom's mother didn't cut
the strings,

14:02.048 --> 14:03.463
she burned
the whole apron.

14:11.264 --> 14:13.162
And you were wearing it
at the time.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.269
How do you think
I got this tan?

14:22.896 --> 14:25.519
Well, it's my job
to take care
of Lionel now.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.694
And I can do it
just as well as
his mother can.

14:27.832 --> 14:30.283
Well, sometimes
mothers do know best.

14:30.421 --> 14:32.285
What has that got
to do with anything?

14:32.423 --> 14:33.942
Lionel is supposed
to stay with me

14:34.080 --> 14:36.806
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health.

14:36.945 --> 14:38.843
You sound as if you
were jealous of Louise.

14:38.981 --> 14:41.881
I am not.
That would be silly.

14:42.019 --> 14:43.917
Yeah. It would be,
wouldn't it?

14:44.055 --> 14:45.436
Will someone tell me
when Lionel

14:45.574 --> 14:47.024
is gonna stop
listening to his mother?

14:47.162 --> 14:48.749
After all,
he's not a kid anymore.

14:50.579 --> 14:52.512
Doesn't anybody
agree with me?

14:52.650 --> 14:54.169
I think you should
talk to Lionel,

14:54.307 --> 14:56.930
and let him decide where
he wants to spend the night.

14:57.068 --> 14:59.036
Yeah. You're right.
I'll let Lionel decide.

14:59.174 --> 15:00.969
He'll come home with me.

15:01.107 --> 15:02.902
If he doesn't,
he ain't gonna be sick,

15:03.040 --> 15:04.455
he's gonna be unconscious.

15:05.628 --> 15:06.629
Bye.

15:06.767 --> 15:08.148
TOM: Bye.
HELEN: Bye, baby.

15:09.322 --> 15:11.980
I was wondering how soon
Jenny and Lionel would have

15:12.118 --> 15:13.429
their first
married fight.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.121
Yeah, when you're
young like that,

15:15.259 --> 15:18.469
it's crazy how
arguments can start
over silly little things.

15:18.607 --> 15:19.677
Oh, they'll
grow out of it

15:19.815 --> 15:21.265
after they've been
married a while.

15:21.403 --> 15:22.749
You're right.

15:22.887 --> 15:25.925
They'll learn
it's only worth fighting
over important things.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.412
Well, my turn.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.104
No. It's, uh, my turn.
You played "super,"
remember?

15:33.242 --> 15:34.450
Oh, that's right.

15:34.588 --> 15:36.970
Then I turned over the timer
to start your turn,

15:37.108 --> 15:38.385
and your time
has run out,

15:38.523 --> 15:39.939
so it's my turn again.

15:41.388 --> 15:43.011
But I was talking
to Jenny.

15:43.149 --> 15:45.496
I'm sorry, Helen.
Rules are rules.

15:45.634 --> 15:47.601
It's my turn!
It's my turn!

15:47.739 --> 15:48.844
You're a cheat!

15:48.982 --> 15:50.984
A cheat? Oh, boy,
are you a sore loser!

15:51.122 --> 15:52.503
I'm not losing,
I'm winning.

15:52.641 --> 15:54.125
That's why you're
trying to cheat!

15:54.263 --> 15:55.816
Don't call me a cheat!
I'd be winning this game
if you...

15:55.955 --> 15:57.232
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.104
Mmm!

16:08.415 --> 16:12.454
Mmm! Boy,
that sweet potato pie
is out of sight.

16:12.592 --> 16:14.249
It's out of sight,
all right.

16:14.387 --> 16:16.423
How many pieces
did you put away?

16:16.561 --> 16:17.666
Only three.

16:18.529 --> 16:20.013
Only three?

16:20.151 --> 16:21.877
The whole pie is gone!

16:22.015 --> 16:23.672
Well, it's easier
to cut big pieces.

16:26.468 --> 16:29.264
And I wanted some left
for Helen to try.

16:29.402 --> 16:30.955
Let her get
her own pie.

16:32.198 --> 16:33.544
Can you get me
some seltzer?

16:34.027 --> 16:35.132
Seltzer?

16:35.270 --> 16:37.030
Yeah, for my stomach.
It's hard as a rock.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.964
Good. Now it matches
your head.

16:42.104 --> 16:44.762
Come on, Weezy.
I need something
to get rid of this gas.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.902
We don't have
any seltzer.

16:48.524 --> 16:50.526
There must be something
I can take.

16:50.664 --> 16:51.872
Take a walk
to the door.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.736
The exercise will
do you good.

16:54.634 --> 16:55.842
Well, it's all your fault.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.947
If you hadn't made the pie,
I wouldn't have ate it.

17:02.228 --> 17:03.263
Hello again,
Mr. Jefferson.

17:03.401 --> 17:05.334
Hi, Jenny.
You got anything for gas?

17:05.472 --> 17:06.887
Yeah. A credit card.

17:09.683 --> 17:10.857
Oh, forget it.

17:10.995 --> 17:13.342
No, I just want one
quick word with Lionel.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.551
Oh, go ahead.
Thank you.

17:22.938 --> 17:26.252
I don't think you should
go in there now.
Lionel's resting.

17:26.390 --> 17:28.288
Don't worry. I only
want to speak with him
for a moment.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.290
You can talk to him
in the morning.

17:30.428 --> 17:33.293
But I...
Just go home
and take it easy.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.881
Lionel will be fine here.

17:35.019 --> 17:37.987
I'll call you tomorrow
and let you know
how he's doing.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.644
Mrs. Jefferson,
if Lionel is sick,

17:39.782 --> 17:41.750
I'm the one who should be
taking care of him.

17:41.888 --> 17:43.959
But what if you catch
what Lionel's got?

17:44.097 --> 17:45.650
Then you'll be sick.

17:45.788 --> 17:48.101
Good. Then we'll
be sick together.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.034
Oh, that's silly.

17:50.172 --> 17:53.969
Look, Mrs. Jefferson,
I know what's best
for Lionel.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.178
You know what's
best for him?

17:56.316 --> 17:59.285
I've been
taking care of him
since he was a baby.

17:59.423 --> 18:02.322
Well, haven't you noticed
he isn't a baby anymore?

18:03.979 --> 18:06.119
Jenny, I resent you
telling me
how to treat my son.

18:06.257 --> 18:07.983
He's not your son.
He's my husband!

18:08.121 --> 18:09.812
Well, I'm not gonna
argue with you anymore!

18:11.780 --> 18:13.057
Jenny!

18:19.063 --> 18:21.100
You knew it was me,
didn't you, Louise?

18:29.970 --> 18:31.351
What makes you
say that?

18:31.489 --> 18:33.767
Because you took so long
to open the door.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.081
Well, I'm sorry.
Come on in.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.878
Hi, Mama!
Good to see you!

18:41.844 --> 18:43.087
How you feeling?

18:44.053 --> 18:45.331
It hurts.

18:45.469 --> 18:47.160
Well, a broken ankle
is supposed to hurt.

18:47.298 --> 18:50.232
It's not my ankle that hurts,
it's my behind.

18:52.786 --> 18:54.719
I guess sitting
in that wheelchair all day

18:54.857 --> 18:56.204
must be pretty unpleasant.

18:56.342 --> 18:57.929
You're so right.

18:58.067 --> 19:01.795
I only wish I was
as well-padded as
you are, Louise.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.215
Thank you for
bringing Mama over, Ralph.

19:07.353 --> 19:08.457
My pleasure, sir.

19:08.595 --> 19:09.562
How much was the cab?

19:09.700 --> 19:10.873
$17.
Oh.

19:11.011 --> 19:12.875
$17!

19:13.013 --> 19:15.223
It only costs $5
from Mama's house
to here.

19:15.361 --> 19:17.328
Not if you take
the scenic route, sir,

19:17.466 --> 19:20.159
around Central Park,
past Radio City...

19:20.297 --> 19:22.057
What? Why'd he do
a dumb thing like that?

19:22.195 --> 19:23.990
Because I told him to.

19:24.128 --> 19:26.372
Oh! That was
a great idea, Ma.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.583
Then we stopped in front
of the bakery for 15 minutes.

19:30.721 --> 19:31.894
Oh? For what?

19:32.032 --> 19:33.793
Your mother spotted
a friend walking her dog.

19:34.518 --> 19:36.002
Oh, yes. Minnie Young.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.488
I wanted her
to autograph my cast.

19:39.626 --> 19:42.215
And while Mrs. Young
autographed
your mother's leg,

19:42.353 --> 19:44.252
her dog autographed mine.

19:47.531 --> 19:49.049
Ain't that supposed
to mean good luck?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.499
Only for the dog, sir.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.951
Look, Ralph,
just bring your suit down
to the store tomorrow

19:54.089 --> 19:55.470
and I'll clean it
for nothing.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.575
Oh, no, sir. I insist
on paying you
for your work.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.232
Oh, thank you, Ralph.

19:59.370 --> 20:01.855
Just as you insist
on paying me for mine.

20:03.443 --> 20:05.273
Oh, yeah!

20:05.411 --> 20:07.861
Why, thank you, sir.
Yes, sir!

20:07.999 --> 20:10.933
Ma'am, what time
do you want me to
take you back home?

20:11.071 --> 20:12.763
Well, that depends
on how long

20:12.901 --> 20:16.456
my daughter-in-law
can stand having me around.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.701
Come back in
half an hour, Ralph.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.327
She thinks
she's making a joke.

20:25.465 --> 20:28.088
But I'm sure I'll be
staying for dinner.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.228
Yes, ma'am.

20:29.366 --> 20:31.264
After I've had
my Bloody Mary.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.027
George, where's Lionel?

20:36.165 --> 20:38.513
I want him
to autograph my cast.

20:38.651 --> 20:39.893
I made him lie down.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.275
He wasn't feeling too well
after he finished lunch.

20:42.413 --> 20:44.519
Oh, what a shame.

20:44.657 --> 20:46.210
I hope Louise's cooking

20:46.348 --> 20:48.316
didn't make you
sick too, George.

20:49.178 --> 20:51.111
Uh, no, Mama.
I feel okay.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.806
That's good. Because
I made something for you.

20:55.944 --> 20:58.015
Oh, great. What is it?

20:58.153 --> 20:59.879
What is your
favorite dessert?

21:00.017 --> 21:01.121
Sweet potato pie.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.229
Wrong!
Raspberry cobbler.

21:05.988 --> 21:08.128
Raspberry cobbler?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.717
Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

21:11.546 --> 21:12.961
Been so long
since I had any.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.583
Louise, get George
a plate.

21:14.721 --> 21:17.414
No, no, no! I don't feel like
eating it right now, Ma.

21:17.552 --> 21:18.656
Why not?

21:18.794 --> 21:20.658
Well, my stomach
don't feel too good.

21:20.796 --> 21:21.901
I knew it!

21:22.039 --> 21:24.352
Louise's lunch
did make you sick.

21:24.490 --> 21:25.836
Mama!

21:25.974 --> 21:28.183
Mother Jefferson,
George isn't sick,
he's just...

21:28.321 --> 21:29.736
Louise, don't tell me.

21:29.874 --> 21:32.360
I know when
my own son is sick.

21:32.498 --> 21:34.879
Don't worry, George.
I'll take care of you.

21:35.017 --> 21:36.191
Please, Ma.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.813
Show me into the kitchen,
George.

21:37.951 --> 21:39.677
I'll fix you a bromo.

21:39.815 --> 21:43.371
Mother Jefferson, I know
how to take care of him.

21:43.509 --> 21:45.959
You know how to take
care of him!

21:46.097 --> 21:48.307
I've been taking care of him
since he was a baby.

21:49.963 --> 21:52.690
Well, he's not
a baby anymore!

21:52.828 --> 21:56.176
Louise, I resent you
telling me how to
treat my son!

21:56.315 --> 21:58.938
He's not your son,
he's my husband!

21:59.076 --> 22:00.215
GEORGE:
Come on, Mama.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.323
Oh, that woman!

22:04.461 --> 22:05.738
She's acting just like...

22:05.876 --> 22:06.980
LIONEL: Mom!

22:07.878 --> 22:08.982
Just like...

22:11.191 --> 22:13.677
Just like me.

22:13.815 --> 22:15.955
Mrs. Jefferson,
I don't care what you say,
I'm taking Lionel home.

22:16.093 --> 22:17.819
That's a good idea.

22:17.957 --> 22:19.268
And don't argue
with me about...

22:20.891 --> 22:22.133
It is?

22:22.271 --> 22:25.033
Yes, and I want
to apologize, Jenny.

22:25.171 --> 22:28.001
I guess that's what
happens when you
become a mother-in-law.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.140
What?

22:29.278 --> 22:30.935
You start
acting like one.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.834
Oh.

22:34.214 --> 22:37.079
How come we ain't got nothing
in this kitchen but food?

22:37.217 --> 22:38.874
Oh, hi,
Mother Jefferson.

22:39.012 --> 22:40.635
Hi, Grandma.
How are you feeling?

22:40.773 --> 22:43.603
I'm feeling fine,
but I thought you
weren't feeling well.

22:43.741 --> 22:47.020
I'll be feeling okay as soon
I get home and get some rest.

22:47.918 --> 22:49.540
In their own bed.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.301
I was just apologizing
to Jenny

22:52.440 --> 22:54.545
for coming between
her and Lionel.

22:54.683 --> 22:58.135
I realize now that
once a son gets married,

22:58.273 --> 23:00.689
a mother
has to let go.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.591
How right you are!

23:05.729 --> 23:08.559
And, Jenny, you see that
you don't let her forget it.

23:16.256 --> 23:18.327
George, come on.
Take me to the bedroom.

23:18.466 --> 23:20.191
I have to take
your temperature.

23:20.329 --> 23:21.261
But, Mama...

23:21.400 --> 23:22.780
Don't argue
with me, George!

23:22.918 --> 23:24.161
Yes, Mama.

23:26.819 --> 23:29.925
And, Louise, call Ralph and
tell him not to come for me.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.480
I'll have to stay here
for a few days.

23:46.148 --> 23:47.322
Yes, Mother Jefferson!

23:47.460 --> 23:49.773
I'll get your Bloody Mary
right away.

23:49.911 --> 23:53.155
"And not too much
tomato juice.
Don't drown the vodka."

23:55.710 --> 23:57.677
Hey, hey, hey, Weezy.

23:57.815 --> 23:58.747
What you looking for?

23:58.885 --> 24:00.093
Arsenic!

24:01.716 --> 24:03.338
Oh, come on, Weezy, look,

24:03.476 --> 24:05.616
I know it's been rough
taking care of Mama
for a whole week.

24:05.754 --> 24:08.136
But I got
a present for you.
A present?

24:08.274 --> 24:10.587
Well, it's sort of a little
"I love you" gift.

24:10.725 --> 24:12.865
Oh, George!

24:13.003 --> 24:16.282
A 14-day cruise
to the Bahamas.

24:16.420 --> 24:18.836
What is this?
Some practical joke?

24:18.974 --> 24:20.907
You know I get seasick!

24:21.045 --> 24:23.358
The cruise
ain't for us, Weezy.
It's for Mama!

24:23.496 --> 24:24.911
I'm shipping her
out tomorrow.

24:26.085 --> 24:28.087
Oh, George!

24:28.225 --> 24:31.021
That's the nicest present
you ever bought me.

24:52.870 --> 24:54.493
ANNOUNCER:
The Jeffersons
was videotaped

24:54.631 --> 24:56.529
in front of
a studio audience.
