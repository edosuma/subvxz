A NETFLIX SERIES

01:12.708 --> 01:14.708
Chris, what are you doing here?

03:12.416 --> 03:13.750
Come on, come on, come on!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.500
-What was that?
-The guy you stole the coke from!

03:31.208 --> 03:33.333
Hey! Call your sister and your niece!

05:26.416 --> 05:27.708
Come on, pick up.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.416
No!

05:52.666 --> 05:54.708
No! No!

06:43.333 --> 06:44.750
Heard anything yet?

06:46.375 --> 06:47.500
No, still nothing.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.875
We're booked tonight,
but we still need a few things.

06:52.958 --> 06:54.958
-I'm gonna swing by the store.
-Good.

06:59.041 --> 06:59.875
Hello?

06:59.958 --> 07:02.833
It was a trap! We were ambushed
by the guy we stole the coke from.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.375
-How did they know you'd be there?
-Sofia ratted us out.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.083
Did Arnaud get the money?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.791
-Is he at my place? You heard from him?
-No, not yet.

07:11.416 --> 07:12.458
You think we're busted?

07:13.041 --> 07:15.083
I don't know,
but Arnaud hasn't called back.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.958
-Anissa won't pick up either.
-Where are you?

07:17.041 --> 07:18.625
Heading to my house. Be there in an hour.

07:18.708 --> 07:19.541
We'll meet you there.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.041
-We're leaving now.
-Okay.

08:43.041 --> 08:45.250
You called me
a hundred times! What is it?

08:45.333 --> 08:47.791
-What do you want?
-What do you think, Chris?

08:48.375 --> 08:51.333
He's not dead.
Saber and the robber aren't either.

08:51.416 --> 08:53.916
You gave me your word.
We said Hassan and nobody else.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.250
Well, yes, I lied.

08:57.250 --> 09:01.041
I sent one of my guys over to get you.
He'll be there in five minutes.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.250
Well, tell him to turn back.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.791
Sofia, if you stay,
your uncle and your cousin will find you.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.166
And you know how that would end for you.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.291
You have four minutes.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.791
Fuck!

09:40.250 --> 09:42.291
Come on, move it!

09:43.166 --> 09:44.208
Hang in there, okay?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.750
Stop the car!

09:46.833 --> 09:48.458
It's okay, we're almost there.

09:49.708 --> 09:50.875
We're almost at the hospital.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.958
I said stop the car!

10:04.333 --> 10:06.000
I'm taking you to the hospital.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.416
If you take me there…

10:10.083 --> 10:11.916
then I'll go back to jail.

10:15.416 --> 10:16.875
It was me. I turned you in.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.125
You're a coward, Saber.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.875
It doesn't matter
what you did today…

10:28.958 --> 10:32.916
no, to me, you'll always be a coward.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.083
The last time I saw you…

10:39.208 --> 10:41.291
do you remember the question I asked you?

10:41.375 --> 10:45.625
I don't love you, Saber.
I mean it.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.333
I didn't love you
since the day you were born.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.000
I have never loved you.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.125
Come on.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.333
-Where's the guy you work for?
-I'm not sure. I'd tell you if I knew,

14:56.416 --> 14:58.041
but I swear I don't know.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.458
Spread your legs.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.250
Hey, what are you doing?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.958
I don't know! No, please! I don't know.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.541
Don't do it!

15:21.625 --> 15:24.916
Oh, don't do it! No, don't!

15:33.083 --> 15:34.416
Where is he?

15:39.291 --> 15:41.666
Shh! Answer him.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.458
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't, don't, don't!

15:48.541 --> 15:51.791
Just wait! He has a lab.
That's where he packages the drugs.

15:51.875 --> 15:54.666
I don't know if he's there,
but he's keeping the girl there.

15:54.750 --> 15:55.958
What girl?

15:56.041 --> 15:58.166
The one from the robbery.

16:00.541 --> 16:01.625
Where's the lab at?

16:14.833 --> 16:17.333
There's no guarantee we'll find her, hmm?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.333
He needs her.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.416
He's keeping her to get to me.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.125
I'll find the guy from the heist,
I have a plan.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.666
But I need you
to find your uncle and your cousin.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.125
I will help you find Hassan.

17:07.708 --> 17:09.250
But I will not give up Saber.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.250
I can't just kill the father
and let the son live.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.750
Put your emotions aside.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.291
You need to think about yourself.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.583
Put her with the other one.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.541
Chris, wait…

17:58.875 --> 18:00.958
He's not the one
you should be scared of.

18:05.833 --> 18:06.875
Mehdi will get here.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.666
And he'll take care of him.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.583
Right before he murders you.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.750
-I'll go that way.
-Okay.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.458
You okay?

24:12.083 --> 24:14.125
I'm sorry about your family.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.500
I never meant for him to…

24:20.375 --> 24:22.500
I'm pregnant.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.208
My baby… my baby!

24:50.416 --> 24:51.958
Hurry, go!

24:55.000 --> 24:56.666
Mehdi!

25:10.875 --> 25:11.833
Mehdi!

26:04.166 --> 26:05.583
We need a doctor!

26:07.791 --> 26:10.125
Is anyone here?

26:23.458 --> 26:24.291
Easy.

26:26.291 --> 26:28.458
Hurry!

26:29.666 --> 26:30.666
What happened?

26:31.416 --> 26:34.833
-Uh, he… he got shot.
-How long ago?

26:34.916 --> 26:36.916
Uh, I don't know. Maybe 20 minutes ago.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Do you know him?

26:38.708 --> 26:40.750
Uh, we found him in an alley.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.958
Wait there. We'll send someone
to check on you while we call the police.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.083
They'll take your statement.

26:50.541 --> 26:52.083
We can't stay here. Come on.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.375
Sign here.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.458
-So we're good? You'll handle this?
-You can count on me.

27:28.000 --> 27:28.958
Where is he?

27:30.041 --> 27:33.208
Give us a minute.
Take care of what I asked.

27:47.041 --> 27:47.875
He's dead.

27:48.791 --> 27:50.250
That's not what I heard.

27:52.166 --> 27:53.375
Chris shot him, okay?

27:54.875 --> 27:57.041
He bled to death
on the way to the hospital.

27:57.625 --> 27:59.916
-I want to see his body.
-That's not possible.

28:00.958 --> 28:03.083
Virgil is having it
transported to Morocco.

28:07.291 --> 28:08.291
How'd you find out?

28:09.708 --> 28:10.583
What do you mean?

28:11.541 --> 28:13.833
How did you find out
that he killed your parents?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.833
It doesn't matter how I found out.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.250
What matters is that you knew…

28:24.333 --> 28:25.750
but you didn't tell me.

28:32.541 --> 28:33.750
How could you do that?

28:46.791 --> 28:48.083
I didn't do it for him.

28:49.250 --> 28:50.166
It was for you.

28:58.750 --> 29:02.458
Sofia, I killed him for us.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.458
You're my sister, okay?

29:08.708 --> 29:09.708
I love you.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.250
I love you too, Saber.

29:43.833 --> 29:44.875
He doesn't have to die.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.250
I don't need you to come.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.500
If we don't stick to the plan,
things will get messy,

29:49.583 --> 29:51.166
-and I'm not getting fucked over.
-Hey.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.750
I can go by myself. Don't worry.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.333
His fingerprints are all over his lab.

30:03.416 --> 30:04.708
He's basically busted already.

30:04.791 --> 30:05.958
So we stick to our plan.

30:06.041 --> 30:09.333
We steal his fucking money then turn him
over to the police. That's it.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.541
Putting a bullet in his head is useless.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.875
He deserves to fucking suffer.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.250
Well?

30:58.833 --> 31:00.333
Why do you still have the bag?

31:10.375 --> 31:13.791
Well, they won't take the advance.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.250
They told you that?

31:21.666 --> 31:24.250
No, no, they're too dangerous. No.

31:27.583 --> 31:29.666
-We'll have to sell the hotel, Chris.
-No.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.375
No.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.791
My father killed himself
the day he had to sell this hotel.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.833
I didn't buy it back just to…
…to kill him all over again.

31:39.916 --> 31:40.750
I know.

31:41.416 --> 31:42.291
I get it.

31:43.791 --> 31:45.541
I know this place was his.

31:46.250 --> 31:50.375
But Chris, please… you need to think
of our children, of our family.

31:50.458 --> 31:51.333
I'm begging you.

31:53.125 --> 31:56.125
We lost 300 kilos that we'd already sold.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.625
And now we've lost the lab too.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.583
We don't have a choice.

32:05.625 --> 32:08.166
-Okay… okay.
-Okay.

32:09.625 --> 32:10.625
Hey…

32:14.875 --> 32:15.750
I love you.

32:17.958 --> 32:18.958
I love you.

32:22.458 --> 32:25.375
The kids are upstairs?

32:25.458 --> 32:26.541
Mm-hmm.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.083
Okay, I'm going up.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.375
Put the bag away.

33:00.791 --> 33:01.791
Is it a man?

33:02.375 --> 33:03.833
A man? No.

33:08.208 --> 33:12.083
Mommy, Mommy! I beat Carlos
five times in a row in Guess Who!

33:12.166 --> 33:14.458
My darlings!

33:14.541 --> 33:15.625
Mommy!

33:15.708 --> 33:17.541
-Winning?
-What do you think?

33:17.625 --> 33:20.208
-We're going out tonight.
-Yeah?

33:20.291 --> 33:22.250
-Could you get the car?
-Yes.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.333
-Hi, Dad!
-Hello!

33:24.416 --> 33:26.166
-Daddy!
-Everything going okay?

33:26.250 --> 33:28.500
Yeah, we're good.

33:51.000 --> 33:51.875
No.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.583
On your knees.

33:55.458 --> 33:56.833
Mom!

33:56.916 --> 33:58.125
Mommy…

33:58.208 --> 34:01.083
Mom, I'm scared. Who are they?

34:04.375 --> 34:07.333
-Don't move, look away!
-Stay there, don't move!

34:15.208 --> 34:17.000
Put the bag down, let's go!

34:18.125 --> 34:19.125
Let's go.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.083
We're good, we got the cash.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.750
The guys have the cash.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.875
Listen to me, you motherfucker.

34:33.458 --> 34:36.291
I don't care if you sell
a ton, a kilo, a gram,

34:36.375 --> 34:37.416
from now on, I'm here.

34:39.291 --> 34:40.875
And you don't get a cut.

34:41.458 --> 34:42.416
We clear?

34:43.875 --> 34:45.291
I asked you a question.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.625
Come on, we gotta go.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.250
Get out of there.
They're coming for you!

35:41.416 --> 35:44.416
5 MONTHS LATER

35:57.500 --> 35:59.416
You need to come to Morocco.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.291
You have to meet the other families.

36:04.833 --> 36:06.291
Why would I trust them?

36:07.166 --> 36:08.708
May I ask you something?

36:11.125 --> 36:14.125
-What do you know about Rif?
-My father's from there.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.791
Yes, it was his home region,
and it's yours too.

36:17.541 --> 36:19.333
You know what we say in Morocco?

36:20.208 --> 36:22.125
Ask a man from Rif
to break his promise--

36:22.208 --> 36:24.333
He'd rather cut his tongue out.

36:29.458 --> 36:32.041
Look, you would have
a community there.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.458
Everyone is expecting you.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.583
Tell them we'll come.

36:45.666 --> 36:47.500
I knew your father very well.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.875
And he would be proud of you both.

36:52.541 --> 36:53.708
I'll see you very soon.

37:01.041 --> 37:04.083
-What do you think?
-We should cut his tongue out.

37:09.625 --> 37:11.458
We need to forget Morocco for now.

37:12.166 --> 37:13.541
So what do you want to do?

37:15.791 --> 37:19.458
We'll go to Antwerp instead…
and take over the docks.

37:20.708 --> 37:22.666
If we do that, we'll start a war.

37:25.625 --> 37:26.916
Then we need an army.

37:29.458 --> 37:30.541
We'll take Antwerp.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.375
We'll take Europe, Saber.

37:34.541 --> 37:36.208
The Antwerp docks are Europe.

38:20.958 --> 38:24.166
Everyone down! On the ground!

38:24.250 --> 38:25.666
You too! Get on your knees!

38:25.750 --> 38:28.250
Keys, give them to me!

38:35.000 --> 38:35.833
Let's go.
