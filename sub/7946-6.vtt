08:01.356 --> 08:03.000
I'll say.

08:03.042 --> 08:05.021
Our assignment is to work

08:05.022 --> 08:07.000
out a peace treaty that

08:03.042 --> 08:07.000
benefits both of us.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.709
That is exactly what

08:08.710 --> 08:10.375
they'd expect us to do.

08:10.417 --> 08:11.876
- Yes.
- It's the assignment.

08:13.083 --> 08:14.813
Well, why can't the people

08:14.814 --> 08:16.542
of Jessylvania and Hudsonia

08:16.584 --> 08:18.460
settle their differences

08:18.461 --> 08:20.334
with a pizza party and a

08:16.584 --> 08:20.334
friendly drum circle?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.564
Because international

08:21.565 --> 08:22.751
affairs are not solved

08:22.792 --> 08:24.751
with pepperoni and bongos!

08:24.792 --> 08:25.959
(ELEVATOR DINGING)

08:33.082 --> 08:34.918
Okay, Ravi,

08:34.919 --> 08:36.751
I'm gonna throw you

08:33.082 --> 08:36.751
a nice, easy pass.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.542
Are you ready?

08:38.583 --> 08:40.688
As ready as a mongoose

08:40.688 --> 08:42.792
at a convention

08:38.583 --> 08:42.792
for slow moving cobras!

08:42.833 --> 08:44.751
- I'm going to take
- that as a yes.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.000
(FENCE RATTLING)

08:48.626 --> 08:50.000
Are you okay?

08:50.042 --> 08:52.042
(GROANING) No. The ball is

08:52.043 --> 08:54.042
now wedged in my rib cage.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.334
Although, technically,

08:55.335 --> 08:56.584
I believe that is a catch!

08:59.042 --> 09:00.771
(GASPING)

09:00.772 --> 09:02.500
Yes! I made a basket!

09:02.542 --> 09:04.064
Is there a rule against

09:04.065 --> 09:05.584
sitting on another player's

09:02.542 --> 09:05.584
shoulders?

09:06.751 --> 09:08.709
- I don't think so.
- It's never come up.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.293
Okay, when I say "go,"

09:12.294 --> 09:13.751
dribble to the other end

09:10.834 --> 09:13.751
of the court.

09:13.792 --> 09:15.500
- Ready?
- As ready as a...

09:15.542 --> 09:16.542
Go!

09:19.083 --> 09:21.042
- Uh, you kind of
- forgot something.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.792
Oh, right.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.083
It is not my fault.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.310
- The ball did
- not follow me.

09:25.334 --> 09:26.355
It's a ball,

09:26.356 --> 09:27.375
not a schnauzer.

09:28.709 --> 09:29.918
This is pointless.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.792
- I am tiny and
- uncoordinated.

09:31.834 --> 09:33.459
- I am a double
- non-threat.

09:34.751 --> 09:36.042
- Hey, if I thought
- that way,

09:36.083 --> 09:37.834
- I would have never
- become a pro.

09:37.876 --> 09:39.500
What do you mean?

09:39.542 --> 09:40.751
Growing up, I was

09:40.752 --> 09:41.959
always the smallest

09:39.542 --> 09:41.959
guy on the court.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.792
- But I didn't
- let that stop me.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.439
Being the best is

09:45.440 --> 09:47.042
also about hard work

09:43.834 --> 09:47.042
and commitment,

09:47.083 --> 09:49.042
just as much as talent.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.709
Did you read that

09:50.710 --> 09:52.334
on a poster with a kitty

09:49.083 --> 09:52.334
hanging from a branch?

09:53.751 --> 09:55.459
- Dang!
- That was hurtful.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.459
I am sorry.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.834
I know you are

09:57.083 --> 09:59.834
trying to help me.

09:59.876 --> 10:01.751
- And I will
- keep on practicing.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.314
Good. And if you

10:03.315 --> 10:04.834
need anything,

10:01.792 --> 10:04.834
feel free to call me.

10:04.876 --> 10:05.876
I shall.

10:05.877 --> 10:06.877
Thank you.

10:06.918 --> 10:08.667
- Now, I am going to
- practice shooting!

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
Uh, Ravi?

10:13.042 --> 10:14.542
Oh, right.

10:19.417 --> 10:20.500
Hey, Ravi.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.059
- How's the basketball
- practice going?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.884
- (LAUGHS) - Does this answer
- Your question?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.042
- RAVI: Whoa!
- (REPEATED THUDDING)

10:28.083 --> 10:29.542
(GLASS BREAKING)

10:30.542 --> 10:32.000
Unfortunately, yes.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.042
- Ravi just bounced
- past me on the stairs.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.355
FYI, his arms are where

10:37.356 --> 10:38.626
his feet should be.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.834
On the bright side,

10:39.835 --> 10:41.000
it'll make tying

10:38.667 --> 10:41.000
his shoes easier.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.834
Zuri, what were you

10:46.835 --> 10:48.542
doing in my room?

10:48.584 --> 10:49.814
I was just returning

10:49.815 --> 10:51.042
all your clothes.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.876
- No need for
- follow up questions.

10:53.709 --> 10:54.792
Hold it.

10:54.834 --> 10:55.918
Why is your

10:55.919 --> 10:57.000
backpack full?

10:57.042 --> 10:58.230
It's, um...

10:58.231 --> 10:59.417
homework?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.000
School rocks!

11:02.834 --> 11:04.000
No. No.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.022
Ugh!

11:07.023 --> 11:08.042
I knew it!

11:08.083 --> 11:09.834
Okay, that's it,

11:09.835 --> 11:11.584
my room is now officially

11:08.083 --> 11:11.584
a Zuri-Free Zone!

11:11.626 --> 11:13.542
- Stay out, or there
- will be consequences!

11:13.584 --> 11:14.688
Fine! I'll just

11:14.689 --> 11:15.792
go to my room.

11:15.834 --> 11:16.834
Good!

11:19.083 --> 11:20.083
Wait...

11:23.167 --> 11:24.500
Out!

11:24.542 --> 11:25.918
Eh, worth a shot.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.042
- Okay, I'm almost
- finished with the...

11:31.083 --> 11:32.709
Are you juggling?

11:33.834 --> 11:35.834
No, I'm "Juggly Sacking."

11:35.876 --> 11:36.938
It's the national

11:36.939 --> 11:38.000
sport of Hudsonia.

11:38.042 --> 11:40.042
Really?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.924
- And I thought the stupidest - thing
about your country - Was its flag.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.042
Chillax.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.438
I plan on wowing the crowd

11:47.439 --> 11:48.792
with some traditional

11:46.083 --> 11:48.792
Hudsonian entertainment

11:48.834 --> 11:50.293
while you do your whole

11:50.294 --> 11:51.751
boring Jessie-buzzkill thing.

11:51.792 --> 11:52.897
Which you are nailing,

11:52.898 --> 11:54.000
by the way.

11:55.834 --> 11:57.876
- Forget it.
- I've done all the real work.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.792
- All you have to do
- is sign this.

12:03.167 --> 12:04.501
Wait, so my country

12:04.502 --> 12:05.834
is just giving back

12:03.167 --> 12:05.834
all the gold?

12:06.834 --> 12:08.500
That doesn't seem fair.

12:08.542 --> 12:09.935
- Both sides are
- supposed to benefit.

12:09.959 --> 12:11.418
And they do.

12:11.419 --> 12:12.876
My country gets

12:09.959 --> 12:12.876
its gold back,

12:12.918 --> 12:14.685
- your country doesn't
- get blown off the map,

12:14.709 --> 12:16.059
- And we never have to
- be partners again!

12:16.083 --> 12:17.501
Win-win-win.

12:17.502 --> 12:18.918
Now, sign!

12:18.959 --> 12:20.251
I'm sorry, but on

12:20.252 --> 12:21.542
behalf of Hudsonia,

12:21.584 --> 12:22.814
the Rocker-In-Chief

12:22.815 --> 12:24.042
cannot sign that.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.438
Then Jessylvania will

12:26.439 --> 12:28.792
use its vast military

12:24.083 --> 12:28.792
might to crush you!

12:28.834 --> 12:30.939
Well, then, Hudsonia

12:30.940 --> 12:33.042
will unleash its killer

12:28.834 --> 12:33.042
dragons on Jessylvania!

12:33.083 --> 12:34.884
- You don't have dragons!
- Read the material!

12:42.083 --> 12:43.563
LUKE: Ooh!

12:43.564 --> 12:45.042
Ha-ha! Yes!

12:45.083 --> 12:46.376
One more point

12:46.377 --> 12:47.667
and we finally win!

12:47.709 --> 12:49.042
Oh, yeah?

12:49.083 --> 12:51.042
- You're going down
- like my grades!

12:51.083 --> 12:53.042
- Wait, did you just
- insult yourself?

12:53.083 --> 12:54.083
Maybe.

12:56.751 --> 12:58.667
- TERRY: Let's make
- this interesting.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.168
Whoever loses has to

13:00.169 --> 13:01.626
dress like cheerleaders

12:58.709 --> 13:01.626
and root for the winners.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.918
Ha! You're on!

13:02.959 --> 13:04.209
But I better warn you,

13:04.250 --> 13:05.501
there's a lot of spelling

13:05.502 --> 13:06.751
in cheerleading!

13:13.709 --> 13:15.626
Ow! (GROANS)

13:15.667 --> 13:16.959
Ow! My ankle!

13:17.000 --> 13:18.918
Too bad.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.021
If you can't play,

13:20.022 --> 13:21.083
I guess you guys forfeit.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.292
Wha...

13:22.334 --> 13:24.042
- No, no, no.
- Not so fast!

13:24.083 --> 13:26.042
I can still play.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.959
- (WINCING)
- Bad idea!

13:30.292 --> 13:32.000
- Get your
- pom-pom's ready!

13:33.167 --> 13:35.626
Hold your poms!

13:36.083 --> 13:38.918
I shall replace Luke!

13:38.959 --> 13:40.293
Ravi, what

13:40.294 --> 13:41.626
are you doing?

13:41.667 --> 13:42.751
Do not fear.

13:42.792 --> 13:43.876
I have been practicing.

13:43.918 --> 13:45.230
When I shoot,

13:45.231 --> 13:46.542
it is nothing but Lent!

13:47.125 --> 13:48.709
Nothing but "net!"

13:48.751 --> 13:51.083
Lent is a holiday.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.625
And we'll declare

13:52.626 --> 13:54.125
a new one if you

13:51.125 --> 13:54.125
ever make a basket!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.605
Trust me.

13:55.606 --> 13:57.042
I can do this.

13:57.083 --> 13:58.959
Oh, all right. If I'm lucky,

13:58.960 --> 14:00.834
I'll pass out from the pain,

13:57.083 --> 14:00.834
and I won't have to watch.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.083
Yes!

14:06.042 --> 14:07.646
Aren't you kinda

14:07.647 --> 14:09.250
puny to be out here

14:06.042 --> 14:09.250
with the big boys?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.250
Well, we shall see.

14:13.292 --> 14:15.042
But before we begin,

14:15.083 --> 14:16.209
I must go stretch!

14:16.250 --> 14:17.250
Time out!

14:19.250 --> 14:21.000
Wow!

14:21.042 --> 14:22.459
I haven't seen him run

14:22.460 --> 14:23.876
that fast since he was

14:21.042 --> 14:23.876
late for the science fair.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:32.876 --> 14:34.334
Wait a minute.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.125
- It's not
- even locked?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.709
Something's up.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.125
Oh, hey, Bertram.

14:41.167 --> 14:42.667
You know, I left my

14:42.668 --> 14:44.167
phone in Emma's

14:41.167 --> 14:44.167
room this morning.

14:44.209 --> 14:46.105
Is there some contest

14:46.106 --> 14:48.000
to find the thing I care

14:44.209 --> 14:48.000
least about in this world?

14:49.876 --> 14:51.293
Can you please

14:51.294 --> 14:52.709
go get my phone?

14:52.751 --> 14:54.209
Fine, but only because

14:54.210 --> 14:55.667
I have to drop Emma's

14:52.751 --> 14:55.667
laundry in there.

14:56.209 --> 14:57.209
(EXPLODING)

14:58.959 --> 15:00.000
(GIGGLING)

15:01.459 --> 15:02.751
Ah-ha!

15:03.250 --> 15:04.834
Bertram?

15:04.876 --> 15:06.276
- You're stealing
- my clothes, too?

15:07.959 --> 15:09.501
(LAUGHS) If that's true,

15:09.502 --> 15:11.042
you're kidding yourself.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.083
There's probably

15:12.084 --> 15:13.083
something in your closet

15:11.083 --> 15:13.083
I could pull off.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.209
Now that is how you

15:18.210 --> 15:19.334
resolve conflict, people!

15:19.375 --> 15:21.209
We're up next. And now,

15:21.210 --> 15:23.042
thanks to you, we don't

15:19.375 --> 15:23.042
have anything to present.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.563
And, no, your napkin

15:24.564 --> 15:26.042
flag does not count!

15:26.083 --> 15:27.563
Hey, you're the

15:27.564 --> 15:29.042
one bogarting all

15:26.083 --> 15:29.042
that shiny gold!

15:29.083 --> 15:30.522
That's why my country

15:30.523 --> 15:31.959
calls your country

15:29.083 --> 15:31.959
"Jerksylvania"

15:32.000 --> 15:33.167
when you're not around.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.918
Jessie!

15:37.959 --> 15:39.856
Oh, I didn't realize

15:39.857 --> 15:41.751
it was bring your weird

15:37.959 --> 15:41.751
friends to class day.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.001
I am so sorry,

15:44.002 --> 15:45.042
Professor.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.000
- What are you
- guys doing here?

15:47.042 --> 15:48.417
And why does Bertram

15:48.418 --> 15:49.792
look like somebody

15:47.042 --> 15:49.792
scrapbooked him?

15:49.834 --> 15:51.397
Because you shirked

15:51.398 --> 15:52.959
your nanny responsibilities,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.376
Emma and Zuri's

15:54.377 --> 15:55.751
fight blew up

15:53.000 --> 15:55.751
in my face.

15:55.792 --> 15:58.042
Literally.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.935
- But you came all - the way to my
- Class for this?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.835
No, there also happens

16:01.836 --> 16:03.709
to be a great Mongolian

15:59.959 --> 16:03.709
barbecue joint downstairs.

16:06.876 --> 16:08.042
Miss Prescott,

16:08.083 --> 16:09.626
I am trying to

16:09.627 --> 16:11.167
teach a class here!

16:11.209 --> 16:13.000
- And can you get me
- a number five combo?

16:14.375 --> 16:15.397
I'm so sorry,

16:15.398 --> 16:16.417
this'll just

16:14.375 --> 16:16.417
take a second.

16:18.042 --> 16:20.000
Look, Zuri,

16:20.042 --> 16:21.101
- you should not have - taken Emma's
clothes - Without permission.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.334
It's wrong.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.059
- Just like when Hudson's
- country stole my gold.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.167
Ahem!

16:25.209 --> 16:26.500
And, Emma,

16:26.542 --> 16:27.689
you should

16:27.690 --> 16:28.834
be flattered.

16:28.876 --> 16:30.022
I mean, clearly, Zuri

16:30.023 --> 16:31.167
looks up to you and

16:28.876 --> 16:31.167
wants to be like you.

16:31.209 --> 16:33.417
Zuri, is that true?

16:33.459 --> 16:34.876
Well, yeah.

16:34.918 --> 16:36.397
I mean, everyone

16:36.398 --> 16:37.876
always says how

16:34.918 --> 16:37.876
amazing you dress.

16:37.918 --> 16:39.876
And, I kinda wanted

16:39.877 --> 16:41.834
them to say that

16:37.918 --> 16:41.834
about me too.

16:41.876 --> 16:42.918
But, I'm sorry

16:42.919 --> 16:43.959
I took your clothes.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.209
Aw, that's okay.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.876
- From now on,
- I'll share.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.000
Ooh, cashmere.

16:53.584 --> 16:54.918
- Don't even
- think about it.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.351
- You know what, Hudson,
- I just realized something.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.875
I told Emma to share,

17:00.876 --> 17:02.375
but I haven't been willing

16:59.375 --> 17:02.375
to do the same thing.

17:02.417 --> 17:04.334
So...

17:04.375 --> 17:06.229
how about Jessylvania

17:06.230 --> 17:08.083
lends you some gold until

17:04.375 --> 17:08.083
your economy recovers?

17:08.125 --> 17:09.584
That would be

17:09.585 --> 17:11.041
awestacular!

17:11.083 --> 17:12.105
We just blew our

17:12.106 --> 17:13.125
entire defense budget

17:13.166 --> 17:14.166
on black light posters

17:14.167 --> 17:15.167
and lava lamps.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.523
- Please don't
- make me regret this.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.125
Sorry, Jessie.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.834
And I'm sorry

17:21.835 --> 17:23.500
I made you do

17:20.166 --> 17:23.500
all of the work.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.731
How about, in exchange

17:24.732 --> 17:25.917
for your gold,

17:25.959 --> 17:27.771
Hudsonia gives Jessylvania

17:27.772 --> 17:29.584
ten rockin' dragons?

17:29.626 --> 17:31.959
For the last time,

17:31.960 --> 17:34.292
you do not have dragon...

17:29.626 --> 17:34.292
Deal.

17:34.334 --> 17:36.188
Hey, wait, we just

17:36.189 --> 17:38.042
made a compromise that

17:34.334 --> 17:38.042
benefits both countries.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.083
That was the assignment!

17:40.125 --> 17:41.292
- Did we pass,
- Professor?

17:41.334 --> 17:42.897
(IMITATES ECHOING)

17:42.898 --> 17:44.459
No... No... No...

17:44.500 --> 17:46.022
Besides interrupting

17:46.023 --> 17:47.542
my class with children

17:44.500 --> 17:47.542
and a sparkly manservant,

17:47.584 --> 17:48.772
you made a mockery out of

17:48.773 --> 17:49.959
international affairs.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.042
But besides that,

17:52.083 --> 17:54.542
pretty solid, right?

17:55.584 --> 17:57.125
- You both get an
- "Incomplete."

17:57.167 --> 17:58.209
But don't worry,

17:58.210 --> 17:59.250
you'll have plenty

17:57.167 --> 17:59.250
of time to make it up,

17:59.292 --> 18:00.814
because I'm partnering

18:00.815 --> 18:02.334
you two up for the

17:59.292 --> 18:02.334
rest of the semester.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.918
- What?
- Sweet!

18:03.959 --> 18:05.042
(CRYING)

18:07.667 --> 18:08.793
Ravi, I got your call.

18:08.794 --> 18:09.918
What's the emergency?

18:09.959 --> 18:10.959
I finally got to play

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
in Luke's game!

18:12.000 --> 18:12.959
Oh, no!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.647
Wait, isn't that

18:14.648 --> 18:16.292
a good thing?

18:16.334 --> 18:17.938
I thought it was,

18:17.939 --> 18:19.542
but when I stepped

18:16.334 --> 18:19.542
on the court, I froze.

18:19.584 --> 18:21.042
That's tough,

18:21.083 --> 18:22.435
- but I'm in the middle
- of my own game.

18:22.459 --> 18:24.042
- If I don't get back
- before halftime,

18:24.083 --> 18:25.351
- Blake's goin' be - trying to play
- Point guard,

18:25.375 --> 18:26.918
- And nobody
- wants to see that.

18:28.626 --> 18:30.125
Ravi...

18:30.167 --> 18:31.355
Chris Paul is

18:31.356 --> 18:32.542
helping you stretch?

18:32.584 --> 18:34.000
What's next?

18:34.042 --> 18:35.643
- Is Carmelo gonna help you
- tie your shoes?

18:35.667 --> 18:36.959
Actually, 'Melo

18:36.960 --> 18:38.250
wears Velcro shoes.

18:38.292 --> 18:40.083
- The loop thing
- sort of confuses him.

18:41.626 --> 18:43.563
Mr. Chris has been

18:43.564 --> 18:45.500
tutoring me in the

18:41.626 --> 18:45.500
way of basketball.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.702
- But now I've
- let him down.

18:48.209 --> 18:49.313
Come on, Ravi.

18:49.314 --> 18:50.417
I know you can do this.

18:50.459 --> 18:53.000
Remember what I said?

18:53.042 --> 18:54.313
Yes, but you are

18:54.314 --> 18:55.584
gifted with many

18:53.042 --> 18:55.584
things that I lack.

18:55.626 --> 18:56.626
Such as speed,

18:56.627 --> 18:57.627
athleticism,

18:57.667 --> 18:59.501
and the ability to run

18:59.502 --> 19:01.334
without getting nauseous.

19:01.375 --> 19:02.980
Hey, everybody has

19:02.981 --> 19:04.584
some kind of natural talent.

19:04.626 --> 19:06.083
What are you good at?

19:06.125 --> 19:08.125
Well, he's good at math.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.626
Well, that is great!

19:09.667 --> 19:11.792
There's math in basketball.

19:11.834 --> 19:13.522
When you shoot, you have to

19:13.523 --> 19:15.209
figure out the best angle for

19:11.834 --> 19:15.209
the ball to go in the hoop.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.939
Plus, the arc

19:16.940 --> 19:18.626
the ball makes is

19:15.250 --> 19:18.626
actually a parabola.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.147
Wow. Chris, you're

19:20.148 --> 19:21.626
really good at math.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.667
Yeah, but don't

19:22.668 --> 19:23.668
tell my teammates.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.589
- They'll be trying to
- make me do their taxes.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.355
Very well, I shall

19:28.356 --> 19:29.542
give it a try!

19:32.083 --> 19:33.751
I am back.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.334
Finally.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.397
I was going to send

19:36.398 --> 19:37.417
a search party.

19:37.459 --> 19:39.042
Because you were...

19:39.083 --> 19:40.250
lost!

19:40.292 --> 19:41.292
Burn!

19:43.167 --> 19:44.417
Ravi was right.

19:44.459 --> 19:45.730
He is terrible

19:45.731 --> 19:47.000
at trash talk.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.751
- TERRY:
- Hey!

19:49.792 --> 19:51.209
Is that CP3?

19:51.250 --> 19:52.334
The sassy

19:52.335 --> 19:53.417
golden android?

19:53.459 --> 19:55.250
No, it is Chris Paul!

19:57.083 --> 19:58.126
Fine.

19:58.127 --> 19:59.167
Your ball out.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.688
Okay teammates,

20:01.689 --> 20:03.000
form an isosceles triangle!

20:04.751 --> 20:06.709
- Or mill about aimlessly,
- as you wish.

20:11.751 --> 20:13.292
I caught it!

20:13.334 --> 20:15.083
- Great!
- Now try shooting it!

20:18.083 --> 20:19.751
What is he doing?

20:21.375 --> 20:22.522
That's the face he makes

20:22.523 --> 20:23.667
when he does math!

20:23.709 --> 20:24.980
For a second there,

20:24.981 --> 20:26.250
I thought he was

20:23.709 --> 20:26.250
gonna hurl.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.709
- (ALL CHEERING)
- RAVI: Yes!

20:44.417 --> 20:45.667
That is game!

20:45.709 --> 20:47.000
Way to go, Ravi.

20:47.792 --> 20:48.918
- Ravi, that
- was awesome!

20:48.959 --> 20:50.147
From now on, you can

20:50.148 --> 20:51.334
play with us anytime.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.667
Thank you, Luke.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.101
- The only thing I feel
- bad about is that

20:54.125 --> 20:55.643
- I should have been
- the one to help you.

20:55.667 --> 20:56.667
Although,

20:56.709 --> 20:58.417
- you did have a
- pretty good coach.

20:58.459 --> 20:59.667
Got that right.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.042
Thank you, Mr. Chris.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.083
But, do you not have

21:04.084 --> 21:05.084
a game to get to?

21:05.125 --> 21:06.272
Oh, yeah,

21:06.273 --> 21:07.417
I better hurry.

21:07.459 --> 21:09.126
Halftime's almost over,

21:09.127 --> 21:10.792
and I don't want to miss

21:07.459 --> 21:10.792
the orange slices!

21:15.834 --> 21:17.126
Come on.

21:17.127 --> 21:18.417
Show me something hard.

21:18.459 --> 21:19.709
Okay, try this.

21:28.459 --> 21:29.939
- Or we could just
- work on shooting.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.376
I do not hear

21:33.377 --> 21:34.542
any cheering.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.647
Two, four, six, eight,

21:36.648 --> 21:38.709
who did you annihilate?

21:38.751 --> 21:40.376
Next time we beat the Lakers,

21:40.377 --> 21:42.000
we should make them do that.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.751
- I feel rather
- bad for them.

21:45.792 --> 21:47.042
- Should we
- let them stop?

21:47.083 --> 21:48.417
Okay.

21:48.459 --> 21:49.606
Oh, but first,

21:49.607 --> 21:50.751
let's make 'em

21:48.459 --> 21:50.751
do the pyramid.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.083
(LAUGHING)

21:56.876 --> 21:58.375
(VOCALIZING)

22:02.083 --> 22:04.042
Could you please stop that?

22:04.083 --> 22:05.105
Even the pigeons are

22:05.106 --> 22:06.125
plugging their ears.

22:06.167 --> 22:07.792
Sure, no problem.

22:12.459 --> 22:14.000
- Oh!
- Ow!

22:15.792 --> 22:16.834
You know what?

22:17.709 --> 22:19.334
Let's play a new game.

22:19.375 --> 22:20.375
Okay?

22:21.375 --> 22:22.459
Whoa!

22:22.500 --> 22:23.667
- Fun!
- (LAUGHING)

22:25.542 --> 22:27.125
- I think it went
- in the pond!

22:27.167 --> 22:28.709
- HUDSON:
- Cannonball!

22:28.751 --> 22:30.125
(WATER SPLASHING)

22:31.751 --> 22:32.772
(CHUCKLING) Okay,

22:32.773 --> 22:33.792
that was way too easy.
