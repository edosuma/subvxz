01:20.313 --> 01:24.581
My job sucks.
Got no future, got no benefits.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.911
I'm here to play.
- Oh, yeah? Who are you?

01:29.989 --> 01:31.921
Who am I...?
I'm on the list.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.958
Show me the list.
I'll point me out.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.391
Yeah. There is no list.

01:35.462 --> 01:38.593
Charles Lazaro invited me.
- Oh, so what you're telling me...

01:38.665 --> 01:40.428
is that you're a friend
of Fat Charlie's?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.593
Well, I'm not a friend
like the doughnut guy...

01:42.669 --> 01:43.897
but, yeah, we're friends.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.904
Well, we got
a little problem here, pal.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.371
Fat Charlie has no friends.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.600
You know what?

01:48.675 --> 01:51.906
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.173
Thug?

01:54.247 --> 01:56.374
Mr. Thug?

02:23.977 --> 02:24.944
Going down.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.411
Jimmy!

02:31.484 --> 02:32.951
You crafty son of a bitch.

02:33.019 --> 02:36.111
You really think you were going
to get away with this, huh?

02:36.222 --> 02:37.621
Step back a couple feet,
will you?

02:42.395 --> 02:44.329
My name's Bond.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.596
Barry Bond... s.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.596
You got a little something...

03:08.154 --> 03:09.246
Look at the paper.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.048
Sir, there is a $100 minimum.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.253
Right, of course.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.325
How embarrassing.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.457
Oh, when you go,
then everything goes

03:20.533 --> 03:22.160
From the crib to the ride...

03:22.235 --> 03:24.294
Here we go.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.632
There's-there's 21...

03:32.412 --> 03:34.380
And that's...

03:53.233 --> 03:54.962
What are you doing there,
Polyester Paul?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.330
Excuse me, sir?

03:56.402 --> 03:58.563
You're dealing
from the bottom of the deck.

03:58.638 --> 04:01.198
This man is dealing from
the bottom of the deck.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.866
Did you see that?

04:03.943 --> 04:05.001
See what?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.909
Okay, we all caught you.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.345
Is there a problem, sir?

04:08.414 --> 04:10.109
Yes, there's a problem.
Three Card Monty, here

04:10.183 --> 04:11.616
is dealing
from the bottom of the deck.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.549
I assure you, sir, that's impossible.
- Oh, really?

04:14.721 --> 04:19.021
If it's impossible, then how come
he dealt himself a perfect...

04:19.091 --> 04:20.457
13?!

04:21.928 --> 04:24.589
Sir, why don't you step this way?
We'll sort this out.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.097
Don't you know who I am?

04:28.668 --> 04:30.499
No, I don't know who you are.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.997
Okay, well, why don't you find
somebody who does?

04:33.039 --> 04:35.234
All right, Zorro?

04:45.084 --> 04:47.314
Looks like today's
your lucky day.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.419
I know who you are.

04:51.491 --> 04:53.459
See? He knows who I am.

04:53.526 --> 04:54.925
Oh, yeah.

04:54.994 --> 04:59.900
You're the guy that's leaving here
tonight in the trunk of my car.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.058
Let me guess.
Fat Charlie, right?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.397
That's right, moron.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.664
Now, listen to me.

05:05.738 --> 05:08.901
Nobody accuses my joint
of cheating, you got that?

05:09.008 --> 05:11.340
Yeah, well... I do.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.140
And I got the pictures
to prove it.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.770
See for yourself.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.521
There ain't no pictures here.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.623
Charles Lazaro,
you're hereby served to appear

05:34.701 --> 05:37.101
as a witness in the racketeering
trial of Freddie Marcuso.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.363
What are you?

05:39.439 --> 05:41.134
Some kind of a wacko?

05:41.207 --> 05:44.040
Serving me papers
in my own joint?

05:44.110 --> 05:46.203
Rip his jugular vein out.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.303
Okay, Lieutenant.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.177
If I'm not out in 60 seconds,
send in your boys.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.479
Okay, Joe. Roger that.

05:58.057 --> 06:01.190
Charles?
It's a pleasure serving you.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.961
And, you! Eat something.
- What?

06:04.163 --> 06:06.063
You don't fit in.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.467
Nice work, kiddo.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.236
Next time, you hurry up.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.175
I'm freezing my
ass off out here.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.769
Here you go.

06:22.682 --> 06:27.207
And, hey, don't spend
all that on candy.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.283
Son of a bitch.

06:40.066 --> 06:44.696
It took you six days
to serve this guy.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.398
Six freaking days.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.463
Hey, he disappeared on me.

06:48.541 --> 06:51.738
A guy named Fat Charlie
disappeared on you?

06:51.811 --> 06:53.711
Poof, Puff the Magic
Dragon, just gone?

06:53.780 --> 06:54.906
Poof, bye-bye?

06:54.981 --> 06:57.245
And I guess you mean to tell me

06:57.316 --> 06:59.477
you ain't seen
the Chrysler Building

06:59.552 --> 07:01.383
on your way over
here, either?

07:01.454 --> 07:04.389
If you want to spend your life
chasing nickel and dime papers

07:04.457 --> 07:05.515
you go right ahead.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.785
Ray, the guy was

07:06.859 --> 07:09.259
a difficult mark,
and I served him clean.

07:09.328 --> 07:10.761
What else do you want?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.698
You know what I want?

07:13.766 --> 07:17.293
I want you to be more
like Tony, here.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.099
Well, that's impossible.
I walk upright.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.104
What are you saying?

07:20.173 --> 07:21.197
I don't have good posture?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.673
I'm saying
you're a Neanderthal.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.902
And I'm saying kiss my ass.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.442
My mouth's not big enough.

07:27.313 --> 07:28.905
You see this?

07:28.981 --> 07:32.246
I gave Tony this file
two hours ago.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.876
It's done.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.784
What's going on with you, Joe?

07:35.855 --> 07:38.790
You used to be
my money guy, my assassin.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.382
Now in the time it takes you

07:40.460 --> 07:44.088
to do one job, Wop-along Cassidy,
here serves seven papers.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.323
It would have been eight,...

07:45.398 --> 07:47.161
but I let Joe have
that one in Miami.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.100
The only reason that is,
is the mook can't take Miami.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.702
It's too damn hot down there.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.296
Miami's not a city. It's
a steam room with mosquitoes.

07:54.373 --> 07:57.373
Oh, that's great, Tony.
You're a regular process-serving savant.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.802
What'd you call me?

07:58.878 --> 08:01.000
Savant... that's somebody
who's really good at something...

08:01.280 --> 08:03.182
Oh, thanks, Joe.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.114
...while being a complete idiot.

08:07.186 --> 08:09.313
Ladies, please!

08:11.190 --> 08:13.681
Yeah, you really did serve
these really fast.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.853
In fact, you served
them yesterday.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.829
What?
- What are you talking about?

08:18.898 --> 08:20.525
What's the date today?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.465
It's the-the tenth.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.901
It's the 11th, numnuts.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.633
Give me that.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.834
Goddamn it, Tony!

08:29.909 --> 08:31.103
Relax, Ray, relax.
I'll go back

08:31.177 --> 08:32.508
to the courthouse.
I'll refile it.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.511
It's the big white building
with the pillars in front of it.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.715
Hey, screw you, Joe.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.613
I'm tired of you
calling me stupid.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.619
I'm not the one growing a
grapevine in my living room.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.484
This loser thinks
he's going to be

08:43.556 --> 08:45.148
Ernest and Julio
freaking Gallo.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.921
Ray, do you have
a job for me, or not?

08:48.995 --> 08:51.758
Look, I got one job right now.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.928
It's an important job
out of Texas.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.059
Pays five grand.

08:59.505 --> 09:02.406
Well, I was going to give it
to Tony

09:02.475 --> 09:04.636
seeing he's been so hot lately.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.109
But now that we know

09:06.178 --> 09:08.237
he can't read
a goddamn calendar

09:08.314 --> 09:09.872
makes me a little edgy.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.780
So... here.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.514
What? You going
to give it to Joe?

09:15.588 --> 09:16.885
After two months of screwups?

09:16.956 --> 09:19.015
It's going to take him
ten weeks to serve it.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.355
Well, thanks for the prediction,
Nostra-dumb-ass.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.054
Don't you have a courthouse
to find?

09:23.129 --> 09:24.460
Eat me.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.422
Eat you? I've never been that
hungry in my life.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.602
Listen, Joe.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.164
This is the Texas branch

09:36.242 --> 09:38.676
of my biggest account
here in New York.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.180
This file could open up
a lot of out-of-state business

09:42.248 --> 09:44.910
for me, you understand?

09:44.984 --> 09:46.008
It's an easy job.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.076
All you gotta do is do it fast.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.146
None of that lollygagging,
six-day crap on this.

09:51.223 --> 09:52.520
I'm serious.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.923
You got it, boss.

09:53.993 --> 09:57.554
And let me just say,
from the bottom of my heart

09:57.630 --> 09:59.222
that suit is kicking.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.027
Get out!

10:01.100 --> 10:02.897
I'm going to go.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.561
You better go.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.104
"Your suit kickin'."

10:06.172 --> 10:08.538
Shoot, this suit cost me $300.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.411
Say, what time is your flight
again, sweetheart?

10:19.485 --> 10:20.509
It's 11:20.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.952
Well, lookie there!
Perfect timing.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.545
I am the king.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.716
Well done, Mr. Cowboy.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.554
That's right, Mama.
Boy, I tell you what.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.454
You're my darling, dearest, dearie
darling gal, and I'll tell you what.

10:31.697 --> 10:34.427
Any of them New York boys got
their hands on you, and, ooh!

10:34.500 --> 10:35.797
I wouldn't know what to do.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.908
Well, here we are.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.640
You call me when you get there?
- I will.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.500
I love you, girl.
- I love you, too.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.318
You get that, all right?

11:03.496 --> 11:07.622
Well, go on. Have a good time.
- Okay. Bye.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.413
Hey, darling!

11:30.489 --> 11:31.888
Hey, how are you?

11:31.957 --> 11:32.924
Good. Huh?

11:32.992 --> 11:35.654
What'd I tell you?
Perfect timing.

11:35.728 --> 11:36.888
You're the king.

11:36.962 --> 11:38.862
Thank you very much.

11:40.399 --> 11:41.559
Ooh, I missed you.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.803
All right, all right,
we're going.

11:45.871 --> 11:46.929
Quick as a hiccup.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.352
No hard feelings
about before, Joe?

12:01.420 --> 12:02.409
Really.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.422
Good luck.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.718
Yeah, blow me.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.918
Yeah, keep dreaming, Joe.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.518
He gets me with that every time.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.727
Sara Moore?
- Yeah?

12:20.806 --> 12:23.932
Listen up. If I were you,
I'd get the hell out...

12:24.009 --> 12:27.272
of your apartment right now.
- Who is this?

12:27.780 --> 12:30.041
Let's just say a... a friend.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.584
Look, some asshole's on his way
up there to serve you papers.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.312
He's going to say
he's delivering flowers.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.580
Papers?

12:35.654 --> 12:37.622
What? Is this about
my parking tickets?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.658
No, no, no, no.
It's a lot bigger than that.

12:39.725 --> 12:40.953
Look, I really don't have
any idea

12:41.060 --> 12:42.322
what you're talking about, so...

12:42.394 --> 12:43.622
Hey, lady?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.857
When is getting served papers
ever good, huh?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.831
Don't be stupid.
Hang up, and get out.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.913
Sara Moore?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.480
She's there in 7-E.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.991
Thanks.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.928
You know, once that little light
goes on, you're good.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.672
Sara, welcome home!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.513
Why are you calling me Sara?

13:42.221 --> 13:44.018
Merry Christmas.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.025
Shit!

13:59.371 --> 14:00.463
Taxi!

14:07.246 --> 14:09.077
Excuse me. Uh...

14:15.888 --> 14:17.788
Mrs. Moore.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.188
Do you have an appointment?

14:19.258 --> 14:20.919
I just need to get away
for a sec.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.254
Okay, have a nice day.

14:24.063 --> 14:26.088
Creep!

14:29.735 --> 14:31.032
I'd like to request...

14:31.103 --> 14:32.331
Sir, can I help you?

14:32.404 --> 14:34.201
Sir, this is
a woman's spa, sir.

14:34.273 --> 14:35.365
Cool!

14:45.718 --> 14:48.551
Either of you two creatures seen
Sara Moore?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.088
Get out!

14:50.155 --> 14:51.952
Hey, you are wrapped
too tight, lady.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.548
Excuse me, sir.
You cannot...

14:54.627 --> 14:55.958
Hey, Sara, welcome back.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.656
Why do people keep
calling me Sara? I'm not.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.762
Can I help you?

15:02.835 --> 15:03.824
Hello.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.735
Man, slow down!

15:32.865 --> 15:34.696
I can't believe
you messed this up.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.756
I did not mess it up.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.233
I told you he'd mess it up.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.396
It's a goddamn cakewalk, Joe.

15:39.471 --> 15:43.234
Look, I chased her all through
Midtown Manhattan for two hours.

15:43.309 --> 15:46.537
I froze my dick off.
- Boo-hyphen-hoo.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.341
Has anybody informed you,
this job is not easy.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.348
I'm going to find her.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.816
It's not going to be a problem.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.182
Well, it already is a problem.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.551
I'm giving the file to Tony.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.249
What?

15:58.324 --> 15:59.552
Come on. Give me the papers.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.422
You know what?
I don't know

16:01.493 --> 16:04.358
what the hell I was thinking, giving
you this job in the first place.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.988
Look, you are making
a mistake, Ray.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.034
I know exactly where she is.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.693
Good. Tell it to Tony.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.237
Thanks, Boss.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.000
She's up Ray's ass.

16:15.074 --> 16:17.872
You should know your way around.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.759
Santa, you're supposed to give
the gifts, not take them.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.057
Yeah, I got a present for you.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.222
Milty, I need a favor.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.527
And I need a swollen prostate.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.762
I need the file on 4-9-8-3.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.861
That's a small Uzi
and two vials of crack.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.907
Milt... Milt.
- Got it.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.499
Look, can you get me
the addresses...

17:58.577 --> 18:00.909
on these speed-dial
phone numbers, please?

18:00.979 --> 18:03.004
Uh, I don't know
if you noticed here...

18:03.082 --> 18:05.915
but the "In" is winning
by a landslide.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.179
Okay.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.883
Maybe this will help.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.051
Oh, no.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.652
I think my eyes are going,
because I only see 20 bucks.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.390
How about now?

18:21.467 --> 18:23.901
Oh, there we go.

18:23.969 --> 18:24.901
20-20.

18:24.970 --> 18:26.028
20-20.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.834
Come back at 7:00.

18:27.906 --> 18:28.873
7:00?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.034
That's the best you can do?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.135
Oh, now my hearing's off.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.147
I'll see you at 7:00.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.123
Miami Marriott.

18:51.196 --> 18:54.256
Uh, yes, I'd like to make
a reservation, please.

18:54.333 --> 19:00.193
Under the name... Sara Moore for a
check-in early tomorrow morning.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.838
Okay.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.740
Thank you.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.676
Now, let's see how we did today.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.369
Nice nose...

19:46.718 --> 19:48.743
Better than yesterday.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.215
I'm the idiot.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.827
Nice place.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.239
It's good.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.193
Miami Marriott.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.197
Uh, Sara Moore, please.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.631
One moment, please.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.930
Uh, sir, I'm sorry...

21:11.003 --> 21:13.767
but Ms. Moore won't be checking
in until tomorrow morning.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.204
Tomorrow morning?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.400
Oh, thank you.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.136
Thank you very much.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.306
I gotcha.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.593
May I help you?

21:43.669 --> 21:45.068
You got gas.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.661
Excuse me?

21:46.738 --> 21:48.228
You got leakage.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.399
Excuse me?

21:49.474 --> 21:50.907
Not you, lady.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.308
Your house.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.608
But we have electric.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.615
Yeah, I know. That's why
it's kind of a pickle.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.844
Can I sniff around?

21:59.918 --> 22:01.351
Actually, no.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.444
Thanks.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.853
Not sniffing any gas, but I do
detect the smell of coffee.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.422
You know, I think
you should just leave.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.191
Yeah, why don't you run
in the kitchen and grab me...

22:11.263 --> 22:12.855
a cup of coffee
all right, cupcake?

22:12.931 --> 22:14.694
Nice place you got here.
It's real rustic.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.131
Amanda?

22:16.201 --> 22:18.226
Hey, are you okay?
What's going on?

22:18.303 --> 22:20.498
I heard all that shouting
down there.

22:23.442 --> 22:24.636
Oh, no!

22:24.710 --> 22:26.109
Sara Moore

22:26.178 --> 22:28.908
you are hereby served
for divorce.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.311
Divorce?! What?!

22:30.382 --> 22:31.872
Smile.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.884
No, hang on. Wait-wait a minute.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.180
You must have the wrong person.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.852
Um, you must be looking
for a different Sara Moore.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.782
That's what they all say.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.155
But I'm happily married.

22:41.226 --> 22:42.193
Not anymore.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.233
Could I get that coffee
to go, uh...?

22:53.872 --> 22:55.965
This is Ray.
Who the hell is this?

22:56.108 --> 22:59.077
Hey, Ray, I'll tell you
who the hell this is.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.975
It's Joe,
so why don't you put...

23:01.113 --> 23:04.344
that doughnut down for a second
and listen to me.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.077
Guess who I just served.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.812
Sara Moore. That's right.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.786
So get your checkbook out.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.187
And since you took me off
this gig

23:12.257 --> 23:14.452
and I had to do it
on my own time

23:14.526 --> 23:16.721
you better pay me double, okay?

23:16.795 --> 23:19.559
Say good night, sweet prince.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.872
Look, if you want to use
the phone, just ask.

23:27.939 --> 23:31.430
You served Fat Charlie,
now Fat Charlie serves you.

23:31.510 --> 23:33.671
And I'll say we served
him pretty good, too.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.474
So, Brooklyn's in the house?

23:41.453 --> 23:42.715
Sara, oh, my God.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.653
You have got to see this.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.190
What?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.691
I don't fit in, huh?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.784
How about this?

23:49.861 --> 23:51.522
Now do I fit in?

23:51.596 --> 23:52.654
How does that fit, huh?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.562
I'm glad.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.898
Yo, Aldo, you know, I've been
doing some thinking lately.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.561
I'm getting kind of
tired of carpooling.

23:59.638 --> 24:00.696
How about you?

24:00.772 --> 24:02.239
Yeah, I could use
a little room myself.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.399
You don't mind there, Petey.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.669
Oh, there's a car right here.

24:04.743 --> 24:06.108
I could just take this car, no?

24:06.178 --> 24:07.668
Why not?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.373
You're not taking my car.
That was nothing.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.380
Come on!

24:11.416 --> 24:13.111
Is that all you got...?

24:13.185 --> 24:14.311
Get over here!

24:15.954 --> 24:18.388
Hey, what are you,
some kind of machinist?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.221
Are you trying to say "masochist"?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.885
What a meathead!

24:27.699 --> 24:29.462
Hold on. Hold on a second.

24:29.534 --> 24:30.899
Your diaper's loose.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.546
That's it?!

24:49.621 --> 24:51.589
That's all you girls got?!

24:51.656 --> 24:53.055
That was nothing!

24:53.124 --> 24:54.455
Nothing!

24:57.229 --> 25:00.096
Baby's going to take nappy.

25:38.403 --> 25:39.335
Sorry.

25:39.404 --> 25:40.564
Wretched bag.

25:44.843 --> 25:47.403
Well, well, there is a God.

25:47.479 --> 25:50.277
Actually, it was two ltalians.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.550
Do you have any feelings?

25:53.618 --> 25:55.609
Do you have any shred
of humanity or compassion?

25:55.687 --> 25:58.815
Well, little sick dogs pull
at my heartstrings

25:58.890 --> 26:02.451
but certainly not trophy wives
from Australia.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.085
Australia?

26:04.162 --> 26:06.357
Look, first of all,
I'm English, you twit.

26:06.431 --> 26:09.400
And second of all, we've had
our ups and downs...

26:09.467 --> 26:12.495
but I stuck it out and
trophy wives don't do that.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.261
Do you know what?

26:14.339 --> 26:16.364
The guy on the phone was right.

26:16.441 --> 26:18.136
You are an asshole.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.235
Hey, I was just doing my jo...

26:22.113 --> 26:23.478
What guy on the phone?

26:23.548 --> 26:24.708
The guy that called up
to my apartment

26:24.783 --> 26:26.375
to say you were on your way up
with those lovely papers.

26:26.451 --> 26:27.713
Somebody tipped you off?

26:27.786 --> 26:29.014
Who?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.513
Yeah, like I know everyone in
New York with a Brooklyn accent.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.915
Tony.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.823
It's got to be Tony.

26:35.894 --> 26:36.918
The son of a bitch.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.758
He's been tipping off my marks
for two months.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.355
That's why it's been so hard.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.128
Well, my heart bleeds for you.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.431
I'm going to kill
that son of a bitch!

26:45.503 --> 26:48.301
Mind your own business, pork chop.

26:58.316 --> 26:59.783
Goddamn monkeys.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.010
Hey, Chico,
make it cooler, cooler.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.146
Culo. ¿Tu quieres culo?

27:05.223 --> 27:06.212
Yo te doy culo!

27:06.291 --> 27:08.851
Not louder. Cooler!

27:08.927 --> 27:10.394
Este gringo me molesta...

27:10.462 --> 27:12.657
No gringo. Italiano.

27:12.731 --> 27:13.663
Mambo Italiano.

27:13.732 --> 27:14.664
No mambo Italiano.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.030
Mambo King, Armand Assante.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.898
Mambo King soy yo.
- Hey, Chico...

27:17.969 --> 27:19.527
just drop me off
in America, okay?

27:19.604 --> 27:21.265
Agase para... carajo, feo!

27:34.719 --> 27:36.084
Hey, I got another question.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.554
How do people do it?

27:39.724 --> 27:41.851
I know you're awake, so stop
pretending to be asleep.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.723
Actually, I was pretending to be
dead, but I can't fool you.

27:46.264 --> 27:48.892
How can someone end a marriage
like that, just...

27:48.967 --> 27:50.798
pow?

27:50.869 --> 27:53.394
What? Are you telling me
you didn't see this coming?

27:53.471 --> 27:55.439
Let me guess.
A lot of trips out of town.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.496
"Go ahead, honey.

27:56.574 --> 27:58.474
"Go ahead. Don't worry your
pretty little head.

27:58.543 --> 27:59.942
I'll take care
of the homestead..."

28:00.011 --> 28:02.309
Not to mention those extra poker
nights with the boys.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.780
Gordon doesn't play poker.

28:04.849 --> 28:05.873
Missing my point.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.350
Look, I've served thousands
of subpoenas.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.752
Granted, never one to
somebody as hot as you.

28:10.822 --> 28:12.084
I don't know your husband...

28:12.157 --> 28:14.352
but I do have a great deal
of insight into men.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.758
And we are mean,
hurtful and despicable.

28:16.828 --> 28:21.288
Male headquarters would kill me, if
they knew I was telling you this.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.097
Yeah, well, "despicable"
is putting it mildly.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.361
And then, you complain that
we get half of everything.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.506
Believe me, after this type
of treatment...

28:28.573 --> 28:30.370
half is the very least
we should get.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.875
The only thing you're getting
half of, honey, is screwed.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.371
What do you mean?

28:35.447 --> 28:36.641
He served you first.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.377
He's in Texas, and he's got
home-court advantage.

28:39.451 --> 28:43.181
Wait. Served me first?
What is this? Third grade?

28:43.254 --> 28:44.915
Yeah, sometimes.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.388
Texas has the most conservative
divorce laws in the country.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.626
Not to mention
those good ol' boy judges.

28:51.696 --> 28:54.062
Sure most of them aren't married
to their first wives.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.224
Believe me,
if I'd known this was coming,...

28:56.301 --> 28:57.734
I'd have been the one
doing the serving.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.030
Yeah.
- How about that, huh?

28:59.104 --> 29:00.071
Whatever.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.070
No, seriously.

29:01.139 --> 29:03.573
What would have happened
if I'd served him first?

29:03.641 --> 29:06.269
Okay, if you had served him first,
the trial would have been in New York...

29:06.578 --> 29:08.876
not in Texas... where you would
have fared a lot better.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.243
50% better, actually.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.391
Hey, I have a proposition for you.

29:28.466 --> 29:29.694
You tear up the papers on me...

29:29.768 --> 29:31.429
and I'll hire you
to serve my husband.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.403
I'll pay you twice
what you're getting now.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.132
Look, here's
what you don't understand.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.231
I've already told them
that I served you, okay?

29:37.308 --> 29:40.442
So if I flip it and tag your husband,
my reputation will be shot.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.141
I'll never work again.

29:42.213 --> 29:45.273
I'll give you ten percent
of my divorce settlement.

29:45.350 --> 29:46.874
We own a cattle ranch.

29:46.951 --> 29:50.419
It's worth $20 million.
- $20 million?

29:52.190 --> 29:53.088
Ten percent of half?

29:54.159 --> 29:55.751
You're willing to pay me
a million dollars.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.852
Well, that still leaves
nine for me

29:57.929 --> 29:59.396
versus next to nothing.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.297
It's kind of a no-brainer.

30:02.367 --> 30:03.834
You're really serious?

30:03.902 --> 30:06.393
I think we should draw up
a contract.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.564
Let's see...

30:08.640 --> 30:09.902
Won't be needing this.

30:18.616 --> 30:22.382
One... million...

30:24.656 --> 30:26.920
Dollars...
Great, let's go.

30:38.136 --> 30:39.125
Thanks a lot.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.367
Miami Marriott.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.907
If anybody calls for Ms. Sara Moore,
tell them she's relocated...

30:48.146 --> 30:50.876
to one of your hotels
in Bangor, Maine.

30:50.949 --> 30:54.385
Bangor, Maine.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.783
That's right, Bangor, Maine.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.980
That's where she'll be.

30:57.055 --> 30:58.420
I thought we were going
to Dallas.

30:58.489 --> 31:00.650
We are. Just playing
a little game of hide-and-seek.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.090
Now break out your credit cards.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.491
We got tickets to buy.

31:34.692 --> 31:35.818
All right, got my papers...

31:35.894 --> 31:37.486
and you know your way
around this place, right?

31:37.562 --> 31:40.696
Actually, I've never been inside
before, but Gordon always said...

31:40.765 --> 31:42.960
it was his place
to come and "focus."

31:43.067 --> 31:45.968
Yeah, well, all you have to do
is point him out and...

31:46.070 --> 31:49.862
then stay out of sight, because
if he sees you, we're done.

31:49.941 --> 31:52.301
Is it okay if I strangle him
from behind?

31:54.045 --> 31:57.799
Yes, you can do whatever you want,
but wait until I serve him.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.218
Let me see that scarf.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.926
Okay, all set.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.928
If you have a moment,
I'd like to take you two

32:11.996 --> 32:13.554
on a little tour here
of our facility.

32:13.631 --> 32:16.429
Why, that would be lovely.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.433
Great.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.026
So, what part of London
are you from?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.570
Hampstead.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.629
Hmm, sorry,
I'm not familiar with it.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.572
Well, it's on the corner
of Penny Lane and Abbey Road.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.907
Very interesting.

32:27.979 --> 32:30.737
How many pounds
were you looking at losing?

32:31.215 --> 32:32.944
Well, I don't think
it's important...

32:33.017 --> 32:36.145
to talk about money
at this point, do you?

32:36.220 --> 32:37.710
You see, pounds... money...

32:37.789 --> 32:39.552
Be quiet.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.422
How exactly did you hear
about us

32:42.493 --> 32:44.620
Mr. and Mrs...

32:44.696 --> 32:46.664
"Poppins"?

32:46.731 --> 32:48.790
Well, we have an acquaintance
here at the club

32:48.866 --> 32:50.356
a Gordon Moore.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.460
Solid, solid, solid fellow.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.835
Absolutely.
As a matter of fact

32:54.906 --> 32:56.965
I believe Mr. Moore's
working out here this morning.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.370
Perhaps we'll run into him.

32:58.443 --> 32:59.501
Perhaps.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.067
I'll just show you
the men's area now.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.510
Jolly good.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.413
Mrs. Poppins, if you'll wait
here for just a moment

33:05.483 --> 33:06.916
we'll be back in a
jiffy, as you say.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.712
Oh, okay, thanks.

33:12.523 --> 33:14.787
I should tell you,
I don't like to lift things.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.327
I'm sweating.

33:25.403 --> 33:26.836
You're glowing, darling.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.838
Hey, how's my form?

33:28.906 --> 33:30.669
Yeah, yours is pretty good.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.674
Keep it up, Gordon.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.301
Oh, it's up.

33:33.378 --> 33:34.709
It's up.

33:34.779 --> 33:35.905
Focusing?!

33:35.980 --> 33:36.912
Asshole!

33:36.981 --> 33:38.209
Sara?

33:38.282 --> 33:40.409
Yeah!...
Joe, quick. It's him, quick!

33:40.485 --> 33:41.782
Where?! Where?!

33:41.853 --> 33:43.115
I just wanted to show you
our candle-lit Pilates...

33:43.187 --> 33:44.154
You stop him, Allison!

33:46.724 --> 33:50.216
Look, lady, I'm not going
to hit a girl, okay?

33:55.066 --> 33:56.294
You go, girl!

33:56.367 --> 33:57.299
Go on, Joe.

33:59.837 --> 34:02.897
Well, guess there's
a first time for everything.

34:05.076 --> 34:06.100
Nice.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.440
Take that!

34:09.514 --> 34:10.913
Quick! He's getting away!

34:10.982 --> 34:12.779
Remind me
to give you a raise.

34:13.751 --> 34:15.342
Oh, for Christ's sake!

34:15.420 --> 34:17.513
Look, babe
can we talk about this?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.357
Way to lay low back there.

34:27.431 --> 34:28.922
Well, you said to point him out.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.466
I just pointed him out.

34:30.534 --> 34:33.330
You are going to have to get
in control of your anger, okay?

34:33.404 --> 34:34.928
You made us look
like fools in there.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.820
I did? Well, hey, at least
I wasn't beaten up by a girl.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.274
Hey, that was not a girl.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.139
I distinctly saw
an Adam's apple...

34:41.212 --> 34:43.737
and a bulge that I was
not comfortable with.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.077
The only thing
we had going for us...

34:45.149 --> 34:46.946
was the element of surprise,
and you blew that.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.742
Look, I know Gordon's habits.
I can easily find him again.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.152
Oh, what do you think?

34:51.222 --> 34:53.690
He's just going to sit around,
waiting for us to serve him?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.350
No, he's history.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.953
All he has to do is jump on
the first international flight...

34:59.097 --> 35:02.558
and then we're done, all right?
Even if I find him...

35:02.633 --> 35:04.464
I can't serve him
outside the United States.

35:04.535 --> 35:09.205
I don't like your tone.
- You don't like my tone, Your Highness?

35:09.273 --> 35:12.791
Don't forget, whenever I want,
I can serve your papers again.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.902
Look, you can stand there
and threaten me

35:14.979 --> 35:17.777
or we could just get in the car
and go and find Gordon.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.441
Oh, yeah?
Okay, where do you want to go...

35:21.652 --> 35:22.646
boss?

35:25.289 --> 35:27.985
Well, as your boss, I'd be
interested in your suggestions.

35:29.060 --> 35:34.589
This is crazy.
You're crazy and I quit.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.731
Hey, I thought
you were quitting.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.935
Who the hell am I going
to quit to?

35:46.043 --> 35:48.375
I gave up half my life
for this crap.

35:53.718 --> 35:55.310
So, what are we going
to do first?

35:55.386 --> 35:56.819
Well, I think we, uh...

35:56.888 --> 35:59.049
and when I say "we,"
I mean you...

35:59.123 --> 36:01.717
should find a mute button
for yourself.

36:11.569 --> 36:15.335
Necessita mas toallas
en la habitacion numero 150.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.271
Asi que cuando pueda...

36:17.341 --> 36:18.774
Excuse me... Yo!

36:18.843 --> 36:22.605
Hello. Can I help you?
- Yeah, you can help me.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.478
I got an important business
meeting with a Sara Moore.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.108
Sara Moore?
- Sara Moore, Moore.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.750
M-O-O-O-R-E. Here.

36:32.656 --> 36:33.920
You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure about that.

36:33.925 --> 36:37.356
What's the matter? I don't look
like a goddamn businessman to you?

36:37.428 --> 36:39.595
No, no, sir. It's just that
her reservation's been canceled.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.722
Canceled? What the...?

36:41.799 --> 36:44.927
I do have a forwarding address
if that would be helpful.

36:45.069 --> 36:46.434
Yeah, that would be helpful.

36:46.504 --> 36:49.396
Can you throw in a little breeze
while you're at it?

36:51.909 --> 36:53.206
Hey, cutie, how you doing?

36:55.546 --> 36:58.135
She's nice.
Who's that? Your sister?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.150
Okay, Warren,
earn your money.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.210
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

37:03.287 --> 37:07.450
Sure.
Everything is beautiful.

37:07.525 --> 37:10.585
My best guy served her
this morning up in Westchester.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.856
All I'm doing is
waiting on the papers.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.557
Oh, really?

37:14.632 --> 37:17.362
Well, maybe you can explain
how that's possible...

37:17.435 --> 37:20.860
when she's in Dallas, moron.
- Dallas? Dallas, Texas?

37:20.938 --> 37:23.600
That's right.
And she's not alone either.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.869
She's down here with some
goddamn process server...

37:25.943 --> 37:27.163
trying to serve my client.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.736
Who's this Joe anyway?
Is he one of yours?

37:29.814 --> 37:32.805
Joe? Who... Joe-Joe the singer?
No, I...

37:32.883 --> 37:36.982
I don't know a Joe.
I can't say I know a Joe.

37:39.423 --> 37:46.350
Look here, Mr. Moore, don't worry
about a thing, okay? All right?

37:46.530 --> 37:49.055
Uh, just give me
a little more time

37:49.133 --> 37:50.361
and as God is my witness

37:50.434 --> 37:52.766
I will nail this bitch,
I will chase her down

37:52.837 --> 37:55.203
like a German shepherd,
like she owe me money!

37:56.707 --> 38:00.137
My wife you're talking about there, putz.
- Of course, sir, my apologies.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.507
This better get done.

38:02.580 --> 38:06.141
Or I'm going to hang your ass
out to dry, you understand?

38:07.518 --> 38:10.419
"This better get done.

38:10.488 --> 38:13.286
Otherwise, I'm gonna hang
your ass out to dry."

38:13.357 --> 38:18.852
Jesus... a redneck telling a
black man he gonna hang him.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.163
That's the new millennium.

38:21.432 --> 38:25.600
Page Tony! And get Farrakhan
and them on the phone.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.331
I think they might want
a trip down there.

38:29.373 --> 38:32.001
Doris, could you send
Vernon in here please?

38:32.076 --> 38:34.773
Now, Gordon, as your attorney,
I would advise you...

38:34.778 --> 38:37.345
not to get your personal security
involved in the matter.

38:37.415 --> 38:41.749
Well, as my attorney, you
screwed this up, dickweed.

38:41.819 --> 38:48.300
Now... let's go over this
one more time.

38:48.392 --> 38:51.225
I'm telling you
I don't know where it is.

38:51.295 --> 38:53.588
You're telling me
you don't know where it is.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.631
No, I swear to God.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.806
Tell Mr. Moore
I'll be there momentarily.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.882
Listen to me, you little punk,...

39:15.319 --> 39:18.809
you're not going anywhere
until we find the stapler.

39:20.024 --> 39:25.860
It was Tommy in accounting!
He took it!

39:25.930 --> 39:28.262
I use paper clips!

39:45.816 --> 39:48.410
I'm just getting the brake off.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.087
You're aware of my current
personal situation, right?

39:56.660 --> 39:57.752
As much as you told me...

39:57.828 --> 39:59.056
yes, sir.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.222
See, I got my tail
in a crack here.

40:01.465 --> 40:03.330
And I want you to do
whatever you need to do

40:03.401 --> 40:06.564
to keep this lowlife server
away from me, okay?

40:06.637 --> 40:08.537
Now, my overpaid lawyer
here will fill you in,...

40:08.606 --> 40:11.700
on his description
and whereabouts.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.243
Now, he's with my wife.

40:13.310 --> 40:15.471
So let's not let
anything happen to her.

40:15.546 --> 40:16.740
But, now, that guy?

40:16.814 --> 40:18.611
Oh, well...

40:18.682 --> 40:19.910
I could give a rat's ass.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.680
Oh, I'll take care of it, sir.

40:22.753 --> 40:26.389
Got Tony on line two.
He says there's a problem.

40:26.457 --> 40:28.322
No kidding.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.359
Where the hell are you?

40:31.429 --> 40:32.953
I'm in Maine.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.223
Maine?

40:34.298 --> 40:35.788
What the hell
you doing in Maine?

40:35.866 --> 40:38.130
I'm freezing my balls off,
that's what.

40:38.202 --> 40:40.602
The bitch is in Dallas,
you idiot.

40:40.671 --> 40:42.070
Dallas?!

40:42.139 --> 40:43.367
I think Joe set me up.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.909
Oh, there's a news flash.

40:47.645 --> 40:52.148
Look, he's down there with her
trying to serve her husband.

40:52.216 --> 40:54.614
He flipped on us.
He flipped his mark.

40:54.685 --> 40:57.694
Now you go stick your balls
in a cup of hot cocoa.

40:57.721 --> 41:01.548
Click your heels three times,
Dorothy, and get down to Dallas.

41:01.625 --> 41:06.300
You nail her first or we are done,
it's over. You understand?

41:13.637 --> 41:17.198
You know, I need to call
Miss Cleo.

41:17.274 --> 41:20.937
Psychics, psychics...
is that "P" or "S"?

41:28.786 --> 41:30.413
Let me guess...
employees of the month?

41:31.655 --> 41:34.215
So I just... I just don't know.

41:34.291 --> 41:35.724
What's normal anymore?

41:37.862 --> 41:38.886
Hi, Doris.

41:40.898 --> 41:42.456
What's going on?

41:42.533 --> 41:45.592
I would love to tell you,
but I can't.

41:46.370 --> 41:49.437
Mr. Moore had his lawyer
make all of us sign...

41:52.576 --> 41:53.975
affidavits...

41:54.111 --> 41:57.279
this morning saying, we wouldn't
divulge his whereabouts.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.337
Nice.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.360
Well, you've been
completely useless, Doris.

42:11.428 --> 42:14.191
I really wish I hadn't been
so nice to you over the years.

42:14.498 --> 42:15.465
Let's go.
Let's go.

42:17.635 --> 42:19.432
So what's in Durango?

42:19.503 --> 42:21.232
Oh, he just bought
a cattle ranch there.

42:21.305 --> 42:22.932
I haven't been there
myself yet, though.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.507
It's Gordon's little pet project.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.700
How do you feel
about walking faster?

42:27.778 --> 42:29.177
Good.
- Good.

42:33.484 --> 42:36.146
Two tickets on the next
flight to Durango, please.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.949
Okeydokey. Um, I just need a
credit card and some ID, please.

42:39.790 --> 42:42.156
Sure.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.228
There you go.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.764
Well, at least
those two are happy.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.395
Oh, please. That has "affair"
written all over it.

42:54.471 --> 42:56.234
Why do you say that?

42:56.307 --> 42:58.502
Who makes out with their wife?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.600
See, ring...

42:59.677 --> 43:02.373
no ring.

43:02.446 --> 43:05.540
I bet Gordon's having an affair.

43:05.616 --> 43:08.777
You think?
- Yeah.

43:09.086 --> 43:11.452
You know what, I really do.

43:11.522 --> 43:14.616
Um, I'm sorry, miss,
but my computer shows

43:14.692 --> 43:17.092
that your credit card's
been, um, canceled.

43:17.161 --> 43:20.687
Canceled?
- Gordon virus. Goddamn it!

43:21.832 --> 43:23.197
Look, I know he wants
to divorce me...

43:23.267 --> 43:25.394
but, believe me, he would not
want me to be penniless.

43:25.469 --> 43:27.369
Um, excuse me, could
you try this card?

43:27.438 --> 43:30.931
Honey, if he canceled that card,
he canceled all the cards.

43:34.678 --> 43:36.737
Excuse me, one second.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.304
No, uh...

43:48.192 --> 43:50.820
It's not...

44:05.676 --> 44:07.769
I just landed.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.107
I'll take care of business...

44:09.179 --> 44:10.908
Hey, fatboy,
you need to watch where...

44:11.015 --> 44:13.676
Uh, these tickets
say, uh, "Durango."

44:14.385 --> 44:16.649
Uh, we need,
we need to go to Amarillo.

44:16.720 --> 44:18.278
It's going to take me
another minute.

44:26.864 --> 44:29.594
What a nice surprise.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.362
Oh, nice look, Don Ho.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.966
So racking up
those frequent flyer miles?

44:34.772 --> 44:36.364
Yeah, thanks for the world tour,
ass wipe.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.635
Well, you've been
tipping off my marks...

44:38.709 --> 44:41.142
for about a month, so I figured
it was payback time.

44:41.211 --> 44:44.343
You figured that out, huh?
- Yeah, using my brain and all.

44:44.748 --> 44:46.613
Yeah, well, the way I see it...

44:46.684 --> 44:49.209
all those jobs were mine
before you came along.

44:49.286 --> 44:51.186
So I was just taking back
what already belonged to me.

44:51.255 --> 44:54.349
You grew up around a lot
of lead paint, didn't you?

44:54.425 --> 44:56.689
Enough of the chitchat.
Where's the girl?

44:56.760 --> 44:57.818
What girl?
- The girl.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.462
Oh, Sara?
- Yeah.

45:00.064 --> 45:02.055
Oh, I think she's in Copenhagen.
Right, Copenhagen?

45:03.267 --> 45:04.325
Really?

45:04.401 --> 45:05.493
Yeah, the luge finals.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.895
Well, that wouldn't be her
walking out of the bathroom

45:09.039 --> 45:10.904
over there now, would it?

45:15.579 --> 45:16.876
What?

45:25.556 --> 45:26.818
Hey, look, that man...

45:26.890 --> 45:28.255
He's trying to serve you.

45:28.325 --> 45:29.485
What?
- Come on.

45:30.627 --> 45:31.616
Here.

45:40.838 --> 45:41.862
No.

46:04.461 --> 46:05.393
You okay?

46:05.462 --> 46:06.690
No.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.698
Oh, God!

46:14.705 --> 46:16.605
Can we get off, please?

46:36.426 --> 46:38.451
My pant leg's stuck.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.824
Okay. Uh... Here.

46:42.132 --> 46:43.963
What are you doing?

46:47.905 --> 46:48.929
Okay.

46:50.107 --> 46:52.940
Jesus Christ! I said "help me,"
not "undress me."

46:53.076 --> 46:56.273
Oh, I'm sorry... I didn't
hear you over the big machine...

46:56.413 --> 46:58.381
that was going to rip you
into little pieces.

47:01.018 --> 47:02.007
Come on.

47:02.085 --> 47:04.883
Well, I only have
half a pair of pants on...

47:05.022 --> 47:06.011
if you hadn't noticed.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.818
Well, I for one
think you look great.

47:07.891 --> 47:09.085
Find me something to wear.

47:09.159 --> 47:10.126
Okay.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.991
No, not this one.
Look there.

47:19.536 --> 47:21.163
Here.
- No.

47:22.573 --> 47:23.870
I'll do it.

47:37.621 --> 47:40.385
American woman...

47:41.692 --> 47:43.922
Which Judd sister are you?

47:43.994 --> 47:45.518
Hey, it's the only
thing that fitted.

47:45.596 --> 47:46.858
That fits?

47:46.930 --> 47:49.160
Yes.

48:05.849 --> 48:08.340
I ain't cleaning it up.

48:17.094 --> 48:18.823
Excuse me, cowboy.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.591
Miss, I'm looking for my friend.

48:20.664 --> 48:22.689
You know, the guy
I was talking to before.

48:22.766 --> 48:24.597
You mean that guy who
threw the dog at you?

48:24.668 --> 48:26.067
Yeah, what a kidder,
always playing jokes.

48:26.136 --> 48:27.228
Can you tell me
where he's going?

48:27.304 --> 48:28.669
Amarillo.
- Amarillo?

48:28.739 --> 48:30.604
Amarillo, yeah.
But our last flight just left...

48:30.674 --> 48:31.834
and he didn't get his tickets.

48:31.909 --> 48:32.898
This his wallet?

48:33.010 --> 48:33.908
Yeah.

48:34.011 --> 48:34.909
Good.

48:34.978 --> 48:36.502
I'll make sure he gets it back.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.911
Oh, no. Sir...

48:39.182 --> 48:41.707
What the hell is in Amarillo?

48:41.785 --> 48:42.911
Asshole.

48:44.655 --> 48:44.755
The Pepsi Monster Smash
comes to Dallas

48:44.755 --> 48:48.881
The Pepsi Monster Smash comes to
Dallas this Friday, Friday, Friday!

48:49.259 --> 48:53.125
And two shows Saturday at the
Union Arena. See Cyclops thrash...

49:18.255 --> 49:20.314
I think we should find
a hotel.

49:20.390 --> 49:21.823
What? We're making great time.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.757
You said we're like
three hours away.

49:23.827 --> 49:25.556
All I know is,
is that if you sneak

49:25.629 --> 49:27.563
onto a cattle ranch
in the middle of the night

49:27.631 --> 49:29.189
two things are
guaranteed to happen:

49:29.266 --> 49:31.894
one, you're going
to tread in cow shit;

49:31.969 --> 49:33.527
and two, you're going
to get shot.

49:33.603 --> 49:37.004
So, you want to get a hotel?

50:01.264 --> 50:04.759
Come and get 'em, Joe.
I'll be waiting.

50:06.770 --> 50:09.068
Oh, your sister's ass.

50:12.209 --> 50:15.235
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

50:15.312 --> 50:16.244
Hold up!

50:16.313 --> 50:18.543
I'm no thief!

50:18.615 --> 50:19.775
I'm just a process server.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.456
Let me get this straight.

50:32.529 --> 50:35.259
You're telling me you're here
from the motel's parent company

50:35.332 --> 50:37.163
doing spot inspections?

50:37.234 --> 50:39.794
And I should give you
a room for free

50:39.870 --> 50:42.600
so you can see how it is?

50:42.672 --> 50:43.798
That's correct, sir.

50:43.874 --> 50:44.841
And let me just say

50:44.908 --> 50:46.466
the degree of professionalism

50:46.543 --> 50:48.306
that you are exhibiting
here today

50:48.378 --> 50:50.107
will undoubtedly go
in my report.

50:50.180 --> 50:52.444
Well, let me just say

50:52.516 --> 50:56.646
that either you fork over
$34.95, or you are

50:56.720 --> 50:57.778
plumb out

50:57.854 --> 50:59.845
of luck, mister.

50:59.923 --> 51:01.413
Got me?

51:01.491 --> 51:04.927
We're sleeping in the car.

51:05.028 --> 51:06.723
Let me have a go.

51:06.797 --> 51:08.264
Sir, we've been robbed.

51:08.331 --> 51:09.798
Please take pity on us.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.333
Lady, there ain't no way

51:11.401 --> 51:14.928
in hell I'm going to give
you a room here for free.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.678
That's, uh...

51:30.754 --> 51:32.449
room 17.

51:32.522 --> 51:33.853
Thank you.

51:35.325 --> 51:39.886
Oh, and we do have
suites available as well.

51:40.730 --> 51:44.632
And let me know if you
need any ice.

51:44.701 --> 51:47.169
I love you!

51:51.539 --> 51:53.175
Bummer.

51:56.046 --> 51:57.980
How was your bath?

51:58.048 --> 52:00.910
You mean shower.
There's no tub in here.

52:00.984 --> 52:03.418
Oh, well, I'll call
the concierge.

52:03.487 --> 52:06.820
Oh, no, wait a minute...
you got a free room in a dump.

52:06.890 --> 52:07.822
Tease me all you like.

52:07.891 --> 52:09.859
I just don't feel right
if I don't have a bath.

52:09.926 --> 52:12.292
I don't get you Americans
with your two-minute showers.

52:12.362 --> 52:13.294
Well, it could be worse.

52:13.363 --> 52:15.024
We could be French
and skip the whole thing.

52:15.098 --> 52:16.531
You must admit, though

52:16.600 --> 52:19.728
it's pretty cool the way
I got us our free room.

52:28.879 --> 52:31.677
What are you doing?

52:31.748 --> 52:34.842
Well, I've gotten into bed,
and now I'm going to sleep.

52:34.918 --> 52:36.647
No, I am the girl;
I get the bed.

52:36.720 --> 52:38.381
All right,
I'll tell you what...

52:38.455 --> 52:39.945
why don't you draw
an imaginary line

52:40.090 --> 52:41.955
and I will promise
not to cross it, okay?

52:42.025 --> 52:43.754
Okay.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.352
My line goes all the way
around the bed.

52:46.429 --> 52:49.921
I knew you were going
to say that.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.999
Thank you.

53:07.890 --> 53:10.350
Comfy?
- Yeah.

53:10.987 --> 53:13.213
Light's out?
- No, you know what...

53:13.323 --> 53:17.419
I'm just going to stay up
and read the Bible for a while.

53:17.494 --> 53:18.927
Good night.

53:19.029 --> 53:24.365
Yeah, I guess I got
the gist of it.

53:30.407 --> 53:32.637
You know, assuming you serve
Gordon tomorrow

53:32.709 --> 53:35.109
what are you going
to do with the money?

53:35.178 --> 53:38.569
Why do girls always have another
question after "good night"?

53:38.982 --> 53:40.711
Come on, I'm just curious.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.214
If you must know...

53:43.286 --> 53:46.949
I was kind of hoping
to have my own vineyard.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.786
Napa Valley or somewhere.

53:48.858 --> 53:50.621
Come on, I'm being serious.

53:50.694 --> 53:53.561
Oh, seriously.

53:56.366 --> 53:59.130
A while back I was this
hotshot attorney.

53:59.202 --> 54:02.467
I had all the attachments
that go with that gig.

54:02.539 --> 54:06.906
You know, a big house,
nice car, beautiful girlfriend.

54:08.211 --> 54:10.179
Fiancee actually.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.839
That sounds terrible.

54:11.915 --> 54:15.078
I can see why you
turned your back on it.

54:15.151 --> 54:18.484
Well, anyway, I was given
this high-profile case

54:18.555 --> 54:22.047
to defend this guy
in the cement business.

54:22.125 --> 54:23.752
In other words, the mob.

54:23.827 --> 54:25.818
Really? How did you know that?

54:25.895 --> 54:28.523
I have an eye for that kind
of stuff.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.294
And he told me
he was in the mob.

54:31.368 --> 54:34.900
Then I realized
I'd just become this cliche.

54:36.072 --> 54:38.438
Some sleazy defense attorney.

54:38.508 --> 54:40.373
And at that moment, boom--

54:40.443 --> 54:41.432
I got out.

54:41.511 --> 54:43.308
I don't blame you.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.940
Well, the beautiful fiancee did.

54:46.049 --> 54:48.711
As soon as the money ran out,
so did she.

54:54.624 --> 54:56.091
You know, all kidding aside

54:56.159 --> 54:58.457
after you quit,
didn't you miss the money?

54:58.528 --> 55:01.827
Well, being successful
isn't all about money.

55:01.898 --> 55:03.559
No.

55:03.633 --> 55:08.867
So your girlfriend ditched you, because
you didn't have enough money...

55:08.938 --> 55:11.735
and my husband's ditching me
to get it all. Hmm.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.809
All right, good night then.

55:14.878 --> 55:16.402
Good night then.

55:34.631 --> 55:37.429
Oh, all right.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.933
All right, what?

55:39.069 --> 55:40.058
I moved the line.

55:43.106 --> 55:45.734
It's still there.
I just moved it a little.

55:46.810 --> 55:48.903
Come on.

55:55.218 --> 55:56.412
Thanks.

55:56.486 --> 55:59.216
Thank you.

56:00.290 --> 56:01.723
Oh, sorry.

56:01.791 --> 56:02.849
That's okay.

56:02.926 --> 56:05.759
Just don't let it happen again.

56:30.954 --> 56:34.822
Gentlemen, I'd like
to welcome you to my ranch.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.758
Now, I know in your country
it's polite to remove your shoes

56:37.827 --> 56:39.761
when you visit
someone's humble abode...

56:39.829 --> 56:42.024
Who are all those Japanese guys
around Gordon?

56:42.098 --> 56:43.087
I have no idea.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.793
If you do that around here...

56:44.868 --> 56:46.927
Go on, go serve him.

56:47.070 --> 56:47.934
Okay.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.038
Oh, no, wait.

56:53.276 --> 56:54.573
Who's that?

56:54.644 --> 56:56.612
That is trouble.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.178
Wyatt Earp looks pissed.

57:07.524 --> 57:08.821
Quick, let's get
out of here.

57:17.634 --> 57:20.159
Hey, Vernon.

57:20.236 --> 57:21.726
I need you for a minute.

57:31.347 --> 57:33.406
Boy, am I glad to see you two.

57:33.483 --> 57:34.745
Really?

57:34.818 --> 57:36.080
Of course he is.

57:36.152 --> 57:37.414
Follow me.

57:37.487 --> 57:39.421
Okay.

57:45.628 --> 57:47.391
Well, you sure made it
fast enough.

57:47.464 --> 57:51.696
Now, we're just having
the damnedest old time

57:51.768 --> 57:53.326
milking that old boy today.

57:55.505 --> 57:57.564
Well, that's the problem.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.231
See, if you want
to get the milk

57:58.308 --> 58:02.574
you need to use a girl cow.

58:02.645 --> 58:04.704
Uh, you are the vet, right?

58:06.282 --> 58:08.876
Yes, I am the vet.

58:08.952 --> 58:10.283
And I'm the vet's nurse.

58:13.523 --> 58:16.617
Um, it's casual Friday.

58:16.693 --> 58:20.423
Well, Tornado over there,
he's normally our feistiest bull.

58:21.064 --> 58:23.692
Good for at least
a quart a week.

58:23.766 --> 58:25.893
But today, hell, we can't
even get his pump primed.

58:28.538 --> 58:30.301
Uh, would you all
excuse me please?

58:30.373 --> 58:32.670
I need to talk with my nurse.

58:34.410 --> 58:35.877
Excuse me.

58:38.047 --> 58:40.072
Tell me they are
not talking about

58:40.149 --> 58:42.242
what I think they're
talking about.

58:42.318 --> 58:44.650
What do you think
they're talking about?

58:44.721 --> 58:46.450
Masturbating an impotent bull.

58:48.224 --> 58:49.213
So what do you think, Doc?

58:51.127 --> 58:53.357
Well, you know what,
we just got a page

58:53.429 --> 58:56.398
uh, telling us that a sheep
has fallen into a lake

58:56.466 --> 59:00.300
and is shrinking
at an amazing rate.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.803
Just getting
smaller and smaller.

59:01.871 --> 59:03.031
Go look over there.

59:03.106 --> 59:04.038
Yes, sir.

59:04.107 --> 59:06.132
You better find somebody
or it's your ass.

59:06.209 --> 59:09.269
How small can
a sheep get, I guess.

59:09.345 --> 59:11.870
So, um, how do you
get things started?

59:12.015 --> 59:14.707
What do you do to get
the bulls ready?

59:15.351 --> 59:16.613
You know, the regular way.

59:16.686 --> 59:19.119
But we've been trying that
for over an hour.

59:19.556 --> 59:22.354
Poor ol' Mickey, there, can't
even lift his arms up no more.

59:22.425 --> 59:24.052
Well, maybe it's just
a question of inspiration.

59:24.127 --> 59:25.424
I mean, that is
a very attractive rump...

59:25.495 --> 59:28.122
but, uh, maybe Tornado needs
a little bit more oomph.

59:28.531 --> 59:29.293
Like what?

59:29.365 --> 59:31.230
Have you tried a Barry White CD?

59:32.635 --> 59:34.569
Why don't you just do
what the other doc did

59:34.637 --> 59:35.899
when this happened to Attila?

59:36.039 --> 59:38.472
You know, relieve the
pressure on the prostate?

59:38.875 --> 59:40.308
Prostate pressure.

59:40.376 --> 59:42.435
Right, um...

59:42.512 --> 59:44.912
Nurse, did you bring the tools?

59:45.048 --> 59:46.913
Um, no, I'm afraid
I forgot them.

59:46.983 --> 59:48.450
She forgot the tools.

59:48.518 --> 59:51.578
Can't really do anything
without the tools.

59:51.654 --> 59:53.884
That's all right, Doc.

59:53.957 --> 59:56.790
We got everything you need.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.925
Oh, dear God.

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.655
Here, let me help.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.322
Let's get you nice
and lubricated.

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:36.365
How far up is
the prostate?

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:39.697
When you think you've
got there, keep going.

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:42.033
We're ready when you are, Doc.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:04.050
You fellows haven't
been feeding Tornado

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.458
any Mexican food, have you?

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.066
Get your dumb ass over here!

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.831
Yes, Mr. Vernon.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:15.836
Keep looking!

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.372
I'm sorry.

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.936
Go on, Doc.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.671
He ain't gonna give
you an invitation.

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.212
Especially not from this end.

01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.962
How's it feel in there, Doc?

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.729
Compared to what?

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.532
Better go a little further, Doc.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.196
Ain't nothing happening yet.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.468
Let me help you, Doc.

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.603
That's the spot, Doc!

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.940
You got it!

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:07.282
Damn, that thing sure
looks like a fire hose.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.161
I'm uncomfortable.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:17.664
Sure wish you folks could've
been here a little earlier.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.758
Mr. Moore came by

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.360
and had a bunch of those
corporate fellas with him

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:22.927
and it was damn embarrassing.

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:24.597
Old Tornado couldn't put on
his usual show.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.606
Look at him go.

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.802
Oh, great...
now I-I've lost my ring.

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:28.901
What, was he giving them

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.741
like a little special tour
or something?

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.940
I think it was a little more
than a little tour.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.813
I hear he's trying to sell
the whole damn company.

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.443
Hey, you hear that, Doc?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.887
Mr. Moore is trying to sell
the whole damn company.

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.857
That's fascinating.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:52.590
I can't believe that Gordon is
trying to sell his company.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.531
Mind you, I have to say
I think it's good news for us.

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.870
Well, you know

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.907
if he's in the middle
of a big sales pitch

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:00.237
he can hardly skip town.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:02.903
You don't seem very excited.

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:05.447
Did you see what
I just did in there?

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.540
I'm going to need a minute, okay?

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:11.280
A bull is lighting a cigarette
in there because of me.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.332
There goes my mark.

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:29.303
Hey, come on.
Let's go back to Dallas.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.785
Oh my God! Quick!

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.633
No, no, no...

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.140
Come on, quick.

01:04:20.223 --> 01:04:22.282
That guy must hate veterinarians.

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:36.198
No. No, Mr. Cedron, every...
everything's under control, okay?

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:39.741
I just need a little more time.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:40.935
If everything's
so goddamn under control...

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.637
tell me what that process server
was doing snooping around...

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.681
Gordon's Ranch up in Durango
this morning.

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.680
What?

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.649
Listen, dirtbag,
by tomorrow morning

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.185
I'm going to have these papers
out to three other firms.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.185
That means you better
get her served

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:54.417
by the end of the day,
or you're off the case.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.821
You understand?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.655
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.217
Page Tony!

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:02.128
Tony's holding on line two.

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.894
How'd he do that?

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.296
Where the hell are you?!

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.132
Don't give me any lip, Ray.

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.136
I got shot.

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:10.297
What?

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.568
Some nurse is about to pick
pellets out of my back

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.667
with a pair
of needle-nosed pliers.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.268
So just chill, all right?

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.645
Lucky for you these wounds are
only superficial.

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.743
First we got to mow that lawn.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.845
I've been meaning
to get that done anyway.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.858
Tony, where are you now?

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:30.915
Amarillo.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.518
I found out Joe and the girl
were going to serve

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.063
Mr. Moore at his ranch
in Amarillo

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.598
so I figured I'd ambush 'em.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:37.633
Amarillo?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.930
Father, help me.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.937
They are in Durango.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.030
Du-Durango?

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.039
What the h...?

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.200
You know, that Joe's
getting to be

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.368
one big pain in my...

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.636
Sorry.

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.682
Must've snagged a weed.

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.876
I got a goddamn butcher here!

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:00.210
Durango!

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.428
Nice house.
- Thanks.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.500
You know what? I can't wait
to check Gordon's files...

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.237
to see just who he thinks
he's selling my company to.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.138
What if somebody's home?

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.806
There's only Maria,
my housekeeper.

01:06:26.882 --> 01:06:28.713
All right, at least
do me a favor, okay?

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:31.446
You go through the back
and get the files

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.385
and I'll distract
the housekeeper.

01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.048
All right,
but be nice, okay?

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.113
I really like her.

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.524
I think I can handle that.

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.859
Holy...

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.031
Can I help you?

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:54.336
Are you... Maria?
- No, I'm Kate.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:55.776
Do you know Maria?

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.939
Do I know Maria?
Do I know...?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:02.882
Yes. Maria's my, uh...
second cousin, twice removed.

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.251
Oh, my! Well, let me
get her for you...

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:07.846
Oh, no, no,
don't do that.

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:09.413
If I know Maria... and I do...

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:11.756
she's not going to want
to come downstairs...

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:15.556
until she looks like Salma Hayek
if you know what I'm saying.

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:17.360
Oh, okay.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:18.400
Do you...?

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.434
Do you have...?

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:22.403
Do yo... Do you have
a bathroom or something

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:25.497
because when you say
Big Gulp up here in Texas

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.701
you're not kidding around.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.768
Oh, of course.
Come on in.

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:30.777
Oh, gracias.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.746
Don't worry.
It's just number one.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.385
Um, let me show you
where it is.

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:44.082
So, are you from El Salvador?
- What?

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.587
Well, Maria's from El Salvador
so I figured...

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.192
Oh, that's right.
El Salvador High.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.824
Go, lguanas.
Cha-cha-cha.

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:56.750
Well, your English is very good.
- Well, we had cable, so, you know.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.405
All right, if you just look...
- Is that all wine?

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:03.868
Yeah, my boyfriend
has quite the collection.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.877
Well, he is a lucky man,
you pink goddess of love.

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:32.895
No more callers.
We've got a winner.

01:08:53.194 --> 01:08:56.129
I take it y'all don't have a lot
of wine down in El Salvador.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:58.229
What?
Oh, yes, no.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.569
Where I'm from,
it's mostly margaritas.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.703
Have you ever had
a cabernet blend

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.242
that is so good
you drink it and drink it

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:11.040
and then you pour it
all over your privates?

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.513
I'm sorry,
I'm not all that into wines.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.549
But my Gordy sure is.

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:15.549
"My Gordy"?!

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.585
Oh, boy.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.011
Who the hell are you?!

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:22.113
Oh, you must be Sara.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.125
And you must be banging
my husband.

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:26.889
I am truly sorry, Sara.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.258
Mrs. Moore to you, okay?

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:29.354
Look, things happen.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.591
You shouldn't blame yourself.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.599
Blame myself?
Are you insane?

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:36.902
I'm blaming you, you twinkie, and
that asshole of a husband of mine.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.697
So... come on, you!

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:43.506
Well, you just got a quick
glimpse into your future.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:47.749
When it happens to you,
page me.

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:49.215
Adios, twinkie.

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.892
Let's take the Jag.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.731
Yeah, let's take the Jag.

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.273
I'd give my life for a hot bath.

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.311
What?

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.039
A hot... Are we suddenly deaf?

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:20.946
No. I just like hearing you
say "hot bath."

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.951
Oh. Well, I'd really like one.

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:26.577
I think I saw a Motel 6
around here somewhere.

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.486
Wouldn't you prefer
a five-star hotel?

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:31.958
Sara, your breasts are great,
but...

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.187
Joe.

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:34.194
Uh, I don't think...

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.390
they're going to get us
into a five-star hotel.

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:38.400
Do you think cash would?

01:10:52.981 --> 01:10:57.241
Oh, hello, marble bathtub.

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:19.470
Do you mind if I have
a $9 bottle of water?

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.701
Coming up.
- Thanks.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.301
So, it says here
that Gordon's going to sell...

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:25.870
all his assets to some
company... Kobe West?

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:28.542
Yeah, and, let's not
forget, behind my back.

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.450
Music?

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:41.218
So, a quick divorce, then he
makes the deal, huh? Nice.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.762
Yeah, I know.

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:46.095
Seems like Gordon cares about
the money more than anything.

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:49.557
Unbelievable.
- Yeah, unbelievable.

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:57.377
I have something else
to show you.

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.641
I did a bit more stealing
from Gordon.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:03.207
In fact, I got his passport
so he can't leave the country.

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.950
Nice work, 99.
- Thank you.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.381
Hey, you know what?

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.925
He went to St. Barth's
twice in the last month.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.450
And, hey, look at this.
Acapulco on the 17th.

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:18.191
That was our wedding anniversary.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:21.294
I distinctly remember him saying
he had to do business in Omaha.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:26.733
Instead, he was, um,
doing Kate in Mexico.

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:29.835
Sara, if Gordon can't tell
how beautiful and sexy...

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:32.779
and intelligent you are,
then he is an idiot.

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:40.084
And now I'm an idiot
for saying way too much.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:43.818
Didn't sound like
too much to me.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:01.167
Am I hearing waves?

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:03.438
Don't you mean fireworks?

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.673
No, waves.

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:09.515
Bugger!

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:18.090
Sorry about that.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:22.028
No, no, that's...
that's okay.

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.933
Well, I think I'll just, uh,
go ahead and get in the bath.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:26.933
Great idea.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:29.470
I got some Mr. Bubbles
in my bag.

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:30.800
Alone.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:35.206
You know, I think our priority
has to be to find Gordon.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:41.345
Business first.
- Right, yeah. Business first.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:44.949
You know, I was just about
to say the same thing, so...

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.611
Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.332
Well, I'm going to go out
and get some fresh air...

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:58.525
alone.

01:14:13.544 --> 01:14:16.411
I'm a veterinarian.

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:18.073
A cow just beeped me.

01:14:48.246 --> 01:14:50.271
How's Maria?

01:14:50.348 --> 01:14:53.613
Very funny.

01:14:53.685 --> 01:14:55.414
Can I get you something, honey?

01:14:55.486 --> 01:14:57.818
I would really love
a Miller Longneck.

01:14:57.922 --> 01:14:59.389
You got it.

01:14:59.457 --> 01:15:02.858
Let's get down
to business, shall we?

01:15:04.529 --> 01:15:09.857
Look, Gordon is a complete jerk.
- This much we agree on.

01:15:09.967 --> 01:15:12.466
And believe me, I didn't need
his ex-wife to tell me that.

01:15:12.904 --> 01:15:15.464
I'm in it for the money.
- Really?

01:15:17.141 --> 01:15:18.438
And I know how this works.

01:15:18.509 --> 01:15:21.474
If you serve Gordon first
then he's going to New York...

01:15:21.579 --> 01:15:24.173
and Sara gets half
of a whole lot of money.

01:15:24.248 --> 01:15:26.341
But to serve him,
you have to find him.

01:15:29.287 --> 01:15:31.278
And you know where he is.

01:15:31.355 --> 01:15:33.050
Look, there is no way

01:15:33.124 --> 01:15:35.718
that Gordon's marrying me
without a prenup

01:15:35.793 --> 01:15:37.624
so if I want to be
a really rich lady...

01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:39.788
and I do...

01:15:39.864 --> 01:15:42.094
I have got to wait
on him hand and foot

01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:44.657
for the next 20 years.

01:15:44.736 --> 01:15:46.431
Thank you.

01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:48.972
Thank you.

01:15:50.274 --> 01:15:55.075
Or... I can serve him up
to you for, let's say...

01:15:55.146 --> 01:15:56.135
a million dollars?

01:15:56.214 --> 01:15:58.705
And I'll never have
to see him again.

01:15:58.783 --> 01:16:00.114
Everybody wins.

01:16:00.184 --> 01:16:03.381
Except for Gordo.
- Exactly.

01:16:03.488 --> 01:16:06.514
Just one snag, though.
None of the money is mine.

01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:08.855
I'd have to talk
to Sara first.

01:16:08.926 --> 01:16:10.655
So talk.

01:16:19.103 --> 01:16:20.866
Hey. Nice robe.

01:16:20.998 --> 01:16:22.701
Thank you.
Where'd you get to?

01:16:22.774 --> 01:16:24.674
You'll see.

01:16:27.245 --> 01:16:28.872
What the hell is she doing here?

01:16:28.946 --> 01:16:31.943
She paged me.
- Why?

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:35.780
Look, before you get all
in a... tizzy, hear her out, okay?

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.382
She's got a great plan.

01:16:37.455 --> 01:16:40.082
Look, before we
get into all that...

01:16:40.258 --> 01:16:42.158
I just wanted to say, Sara,...

01:16:42.226 --> 01:16:45.457
I feel really badly about
stealing your husband.

01:16:45.797 --> 01:16:49.665
So badly, in fact, that there's
a guy I'd like you to meet.

01:16:49.734 --> 01:16:51.326
Sara Moore,
you are hereby served

01:16:51.402 --> 01:16:52.664
for divorce under the laws

01:16:52.737 --> 01:16:54.261
governing the great
State of Texas.

01:16:54.338 --> 01:16:55.270
Joe! Do something.

01:16:56.741 --> 01:16:58.038
Take another one for my buddy

01:16:58.109 --> 01:16:59.371
Joe here,
just to bust his balls.

01:16:59.443 --> 01:17:01.001
Cheese.

01:17:01.078 --> 01:17:03.768
Beautiful, beautiful.
Thank you.

01:17:05.683 --> 01:17:09.214
Classic honey trap.
Oldest trick in the book.

01:17:09.287 --> 01:17:11.755
You should read it sometime.

01:17:11.823 --> 01:17:13.916
Oh, and I'll see you
back in New York...

01:17:13.991 --> 01:17:17.300
when you come to clean
out your desk, ass wipe.

01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:20.491
Look what I got.

01:17:26.604 --> 01:17:28.765
He is cute.

01:17:28.873 --> 01:17:31.538
It's too bad
he's just a process server.

01:17:40.451 --> 01:17:44.046
So, one look at a girl
in tight pants and big tits

01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:45.554
and suddenly you're stupid?

01:17:45.623 --> 01:17:48.091
It's not the way this was
supposed to go down.

01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:50.423
How could you blow this?

01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:53.963
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

01:17:54.031 --> 01:17:55.794
Look, Sara,
can we just focus

01:17:55.867 --> 01:17:57.494
on what we have to do now?

01:17:57.568 --> 01:17:59.763
Yes, we can.

01:17:59.837 --> 01:18:01.327
You can focus
on getting the hell out

01:18:01.405 --> 01:18:02.531
of this hotel room.

01:18:02.607 --> 01:18:04.837
Go. Get out of here.
Leave. Good-bye.

01:18:06.777 --> 01:18:08.836
Good-bye?

01:18:10.882 --> 01:18:12.440
That's it?

01:18:12.516 --> 01:18:14.177
Yeah.

01:18:14.252 --> 01:18:16.117
Go on. There's
nothing else to say.

01:18:29.667 --> 01:18:31.601
You a genius, you hear me?

01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:32.931
A goddamn genius!

01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:34.096
That's all right.

01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:35.195
You know what?

01:18:35.273 --> 01:18:37.366
It's only been
three white geniuses ever.

01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:38.430
Oh, yeah.

01:18:38.509 --> 01:18:41.137
Da Vinci, Stallone
in the first Rocky

01:18:41.212 --> 01:18:42.201
and now you, Tony.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.338
Oh, thank you, Ray.

01:18:43.414 --> 01:18:45.439
I swear...
I love you for this, boy.

01:18:45.516 --> 01:18:46.642
I love you for this.

01:18:46.717 --> 01:18:47.775
You know what?

01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:49.786
I need you to fax me
a copy of the papers

01:18:49.854 --> 01:18:51.788
take the originals
down to the courthouse

01:18:51.856 --> 01:18:53.221
and get your butt back here.

01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:54.349
Oh, yeah.

01:18:54.425 --> 01:18:56.791
I'm going to buy you
the biggest steak in Manhattan.

01:18:56.894 --> 01:18:57.792
You hear me?

01:18:57.895 --> 01:18:59.795
On my way.
On my way, fast as I can.

01:18:59.897 --> 01:19:01.524
Okay. Look here, you know what?

01:19:01.599 --> 01:19:03.157
It's okay... fly first class.

01:19:03.234 --> 01:19:04.166
First class?

01:19:04.235 --> 01:19:06.362
Good.
- First class... all right.

01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:08.701
What?
- Wait a minute.

01:19:08.773 --> 01:19:10.570
Make that business class.

01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:11.835
Business? Okay.

01:19:28.926 --> 01:19:30.757
I wore myself out.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.417
Did he...?

01:19:57.488 --> 01:19:58.546
Wait a minute, I need a phone.

01:19:58.622 --> 01:19:59.714
I need a phone!

01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:02.725
Ray, Joe's on line one.

01:20:05.196 --> 01:20:07.289
Hello, loser.

01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:09.959
You little dirty...
you... you tried

01:20:10.034 --> 01:20:11.626
to double-cross me, didn't you?

01:20:11.702 --> 01:20:13.727
You know what?
I got something for you.

01:20:13.804 --> 01:20:14.793
It's over.

01:20:14.872 --> 01:20:16.806
Yeah, I guess
you really got me, Ray.

01:20:16.907 --> 01:20:17.805
That's right.

01:20:17.908 --> 01:20:19.637
Who's my bitch, huh?

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.304
Who's my bi...tch?

01:20:24.081 --> 01:20:25.912
Yeah, I'm your bitch.

01:20:25.983 --> 01:20:29.214
So, uh, did Tony
make the plane okay?

01:20:29.286 --> 01:20:31.618
You know what? He sure did.

01:20:31.689 --> 01:20:34.283
And he's flying
first class, too.

01:20:34.358 --> 01:20:35.825
Oh... see...

01:20:35.926 --> 01:20:36.984
I was really hoping

01:20:37.061 --> 01:20:39.427
that he didn't drop
the papers off at city hall.

01:20:39.497 --> 01:20:41.556
Well, you can hope
all you want to, Gladys

01:20:41.632 --> 01:20:42.963
'cause he did. It's over.

01:20:43.034 --> 01:20:44.729
Now, you probably have a, uh...

01:20:44.802 --> 01:20:46.827
copy of that file
lying around somewhere.

01:20:46.971 --> 01:20:48.529
Would you mind, uh, telling me

01:20:48.606 --> 01:20:50.506
what time
my career officially ended?

01:20:50.574 --> 01:20:51.734
I'd love to know that.

01:20:51.809 --> 01:20:53.674
7:04. You hear that?

01:20:53.744 --> 01:20:55.939
Remember it, write it down,
paint a picture...

01:20:56.013 --> 01:20:57.241
I don't care what you do.

01:20:57.314 --> 01:21:00.680
Seven, zero, and then
it's a big four after that.

01:21:01.419 --> 01:21:02.511
It's over.

01:21:02.586 --> 01:21:04.281
Yeah, that's so funny,
you know

01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:06.724
because, uh, my watch here
says it's 6:15.

01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:11.785
Looks like Retardo Montalban
forgot to set his watch back.

01:21:11.929 --> 01:21:14.591
With the time difference
between here and New York

01:21:14.665 --> 01:21:15.689
I can still serve Gordon.

01:21:15.766 --> 01:21:19.031
I've still got 49 minutes. 49.

01:21:19.103 --> 01:21:20.730
You know that number.

01:21:20.805 --> 01:21:22.102
Your I.Q.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.747
Hello?

01:21:30.815 --> 01:21:32.112
Gordon Moore, Milt.

01:21:32.183 --> 01:21:33.115
What do you got?

01:21:33.184 --> 01:21:35.049
You want to hear what's great?

01:21:35.119 --> 01:21:36.518
Your guy's got Lojack.

01:21:36.587 --> 01:21:37.918
For a very reasonable
$50 surcharge

01:21:37.988 --> 01:21:39.751
I can tell you exactly
where he is right now.

01:21:39.824 --> 01:21:42.190
Milt, you are a beautiful,
beautiful man.

01:21:42.259 --> 01:21:45.523
All right, he's at the southwest
corner of Lakeville and Beverly.

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:47.821
I looked it up.
It's some fancy steak house.

01:21:47.965 --> 01:21:49.057
You got it.

01:21:49.133 --> 01:21:51.761
You just made five grand.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.809
Sure, but after taxes...?

01:22:02.513 --> 01:22:05.573
On the screens ahead of you,
we will run our safety video.

01:22:05.649 --> 01:22:07.549
But first,
the captain has turned on

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:10.610
the fasten-seat-belt sign,
and we'll be departing shortly.

01:22:10.688 --> 01:22:13.384
Please remain seated
as we back away from the gate.

01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.162
Sir, please take your seat.

01:22:20.231 --> 01:22:21.198
No, excuse me.

01:22:21.265 --> 01:22:22.789
Uh, I'm a...
I'm a heart surgeon...

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.392
and I got a patient that needs
an emergency... heart.

01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:28.131
What's the matter?

01:22:28.205 --> 01:22:31.106
I don't look like a goddamn
heart surgeon to you?!

01:22:34.979 --> 01:22:36.105
Get in.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:37.807
Are you high?

01:22:37.915 --> 01:22:39.780
This is better. Look,
we don't have time for this.

01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:40.817
It's over, you idiot.

01:22:40.918 --> 01:22:41.907
You've blown it.

01:22:41.986 --> 01:22:43.977
We have another hour
to get Gordon.

01:22:44.054 --> 01:22:45.612
An hour?

01:22:45.689 --> 01:22:49.489
Yeah, uh, Mrs. Siebler,
good news... yeah.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.050
We-we got her.

01:22:51.128 --> 01:22:52.823
Yeah, we did.

01:22:52.897 --> 01:22:58.392
Listen, there is just
one tiny little thing.

01:22:58.469 --> 01:23:01.802
We didn't "get her" get her,
though.

01:23:06.577 --> 01:23:12.206
I... I mean, in a way, we got her
but not like if you get somebody.

01:23:13.517 --> 01:23:14.609
You know how, you say

01:23:14.685 --> 01:23:16.983
like if you was playing
hide-and-go-get-it

01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:19.352
and you get it, but you don't
really get none of it

01:23:19.423 --> 01:23:20.447
but you get it?

01:23:20.524 --> 01:23:23.322
That's kind of the way
that we got her...

01:23:23.394 --> 01:23:27.694
is she got, but not really got,
if you know what I'm saying.

01:23:27.765 --> 01:23:30.165
It's kind of an enigma.

01:23:35.306 --> 01:23:38.104
Now to us,
beef might be a big deal

01:23:38.175 --> 01:23:41.110
but to a cow,
it's just another day.

01:23:43.247 --> 01:23:44.236
You know what to do.

01:23:44.315 --> 01:23:45.543
Keep them boys tethered.

01:23:45.616 --> 01:23:46.947
Sit.

01:23:51.555 --> 01:23:54.718
Oh, and I got a belly full
of steer.

01:23:54.792 --> 01:23:56.555
Gordon Moore!

01:23:56.627 --> 01:24:00.461
I am hereby here to serve you!

01:24:10.374 --> 01:24:11.534
Gordo!

01:24:11.609 --> 01:24:12.906
This is Warren.
- Hey, Warren...

01:24:12.977 --> 01:24:14.103
Gordon, finally, damn.

01:24:14.178 --> 01:24:16.475
Look, Sara's been served
but there's been a problem.

01:24:16.914 --> 01:24:18.905
Hey, you're telling
me there's a problem.

01:24:18.983 --> 01:24:21.042
She and that process server

01:24:21.118 --> 01:24:23.143
are crawling all over
my ass right now.

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.780
I got you, Gordo!

01:24:25.923 --> 01:24:28.153
Ooh... damn longhorns.

01:24:28.225 --> 01:24:29.692
Uh, Gordon...

01:24:30.961 --> 01:24:32.622
Hang on.

01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:34.798
Gordo!

01:24:34.898 --> 01:24:36.763
Okay, go ahead. Yeah?

01:24:36.834 --> 01:24:37.766
Gordon, this whole thing's

01:24:37.835 --> 01:24:39.132
a little difficult
to explain right now.

01:24:39.203 --> 01:24:40.761
They can still serve you, Gordon

01:24:40.838 --> 01:24:43.329
so you can't let them catch you
or you're screwed.

01:24:43.407 --> 01:24:46.240
Just stay away from them
for the next 22 minutes.

01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:47.538
That'll be till 7:04.

01:24:47.611 --> 01:24:49.374
Can you do that, do you think?

01:24:51.715 --> 01:24:54.980
Yeah, now I can.

01:24:58.622 --> 01:25:00.749
Season ticket holder.

01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:05.317
Yeah?

01:25:05.396 --> 01:25:06.727
Look, I've just talked
to Warren.

01:25:06.797 --> 01:25:08.729
Get your ass
down to Union Arena.

01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:11.760
We got to keep Joe off
Gordon until 7:04.

01:25:11.902 --> 01:25:12.994
Got it. Hey, Ray?

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:14.002
Yeah.

01:25:14.071 --> 01:25:15.402
Where the hell's
the Union Arena?

01:25:15.472 --> 01:25:16.769
I don't know.

01:25:16.907 --> 01:25:18.875
You the one in Texas.

01:25:20.811 --> 01:25:23.041
Time for the beasties to battle.

01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:24.876
It's been building
all afternoon.

01:25:24.948 --> 01:25:29.282
And here we have the finals...

01:26:10.661 --> 01:26:11.355
I have an idea.

01:26:11.428 --> 01:26:12.588
What?

01:26:12.663 --> 01:26:13.891
Just come on.

01:26:20.471 --> 01:26:21.768
Hey, you can't come in here.

01:26:21.905 --> 01:26:22.997
Does this phone work?

01:26:23.073 --> 01:26:24.472
What are you doing?

01:26:24.541 --> 01:26:26.668
Damn it, Cheryl, you
know as well as I do

01:26:26.744 --> 01:26:28.075
in about 30 minutes 20,000

01:26:28.145 --> 01:26:29.407
of those church-going fans

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.345
are going to be puking
up their vital organs

01:26:31.415 --> 01:26:33.144
and it's not
going to be pretty.

01:26:33.217 --> 01:26:34.514
Who are you guys?

01:26:34.585 --> 01:26:36.917
Center for Disease Control.

01:26:39.556 --> 01:26:43.287
You see,
this man most recently

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.123
was bitten by a monkey
at our facility.

01:26:45.195 --> 01:26:46.958
My, God, I wish
there was some way

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:49.294
we could warn these poor,
innocent people.

01:26:49.366 --> 01:26:51.724
What's your name, son?
- Rusty.

01:26:51.935 --> 01:26:55.132
Rusty... have you ever
dreamed of being a hero?

01:26:55.205 --> 01:26:57.366
Have you, Rusty?

01:27:10.554 --> 01:27:13.887
Ladies and gentlemen, may l
have your attention, please?

01:27:13.957 --> 01:27:15.857
Joe?

01:27:15.926 --> 01:27:18.451
There is no need for alarm,
but if the individual

01:27:18.529 --> 01:27:20.156
pictured on the screen
above you...

01:27:25.202 --> 01:27:26.396
Nice job, Rusty...

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:29.906
is sitting anywhere near you

01:27:29.973 --> 01:27:34.342
please get up and walk away from
him in a calm, orderly fashion.

01:27:34.411 --> 01:27:37.346
He may be a carrier
of the deadly

01:27:37.414 --> 01:27:39.245
Ebola virus.

01:27:39.316 --> 01:27:42.410
Goddamn you, Joe!

01:27:47.357 --> 01:27:49.455
My God! It's the Ebola guy!

01:27:50.594 --> 01:27:52.721
Hey, I'm clean.

01:27:52.796 --> 01:27:54.263
That's him.

01:27:56.099 --> 01:27:57.225
Shoot him.

01:27:57.301 --> 01:27:58.928
No, no, wait.
Don't-Don't shoot him.

01:27:59.002 --> 01:28:00.469
Don't shoot him.

01:28:00.537 --> 01:28:03.097
I need to serve him!
I need to serve him!

01:28:08.312 --> 01:28:09.745
Freeze!

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.972
Somebody shoot him!

01:28:11.048 --> 01:28:12.538
Hold it.

01:29:26.256 --> 01:29:27.814
I'm going to get you, Joe!

01:29:35.132 --> 01:29:36.724
Oh, boy.

01:29:37.768 --> 01:29:39.201
How do you do this?

01:29:55.319 --> 01:29:56.411
Oh, this is gonna be ugly.

01:30:06.296 --> 01:30:08.457
Mommy!

01:30:11.335 --> 01:30:13.132
Get this damn truck off me!

01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:14.636
Eat me.

01:30:14.705 --> 01:30:17.299
My dog ain't in that fight.

01:30:28.452 --> 01:30:31.216
Adios, amigos.

01:30:31.288 --> 01:30:32.312
Last call, Gordy.

01:30:37.494 --> 01:30:40.754
Gordon Moore, you are hereby
served for divorce...

01:30:40.831 --> 01:30:43.322
under the laws governing
the State of New York.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.129
Here you go, hop-a-long.
You know, dusty.

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:50.172
Say "Half."
- Hang on.

01:31:00.917 --> 01:31:02.441
Let's rock and roll.

01:31:02.519 --> 01:31:05.883
This Gordon guy's going to need to
be quarantined for about a year.

01:31:09.292 --> 01:31:12.056
Excuse me, sir.

01:31:16.966 --> 01:31:19.265
We did it.
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:31:21.772 --> 01:31:23.171
Business first.

01:31:30.914 --> 01:31:34.509
You'll get your money,
don't worry.

01:31:34.584 --> 01:31:36.211
First, you're going
to get this.

01:31:36.286 --> 01:31:37.810
Hey. You mother.

01:31:37.954 --> 01:31:39.444
Hey, nice driving back there.

01:31:39.523 --> 01:31:41.491
You're finished, Joe.
You flipped your mark.

01:31:41.558 --> 01:31:42.786
You're finished.

01:31:44.294 --> 01:31:46.159
I don't believe
you two have met.

01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:47.992
Guy who got run over,
guy who ran you over.

01:31:48.065 --> 01:31:49.999
Ran me over, asshole!

01:31:50.067 --> 01:31:51.432
Screw you, cowboy.

01:32:00.877 --> 01:32:04.404
So... where were we?

01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:06.642
We were just getting
down to business.

01:32:06.717 --> 01:32:08.412
Oh, right.

01:32:28.138 --> 01:32:31.335
So, 14 months
and a million dollars later

01:32:31.408 --> 01:32:33.103
I got my vineyard.

01:32:33.176 --> 01:32:35.235
Growing grapes isn't easy

01:32:35.312 --> 01:32:37.542
but at least
it's got its benefits.

01:32:37.614 --> 01:32:39.104
Joe?

01:32:39.182 --> 01:32:41.844
I thought I'd serve you
for a change.

01:32:45.155 --> 01:32:46.679
The first bottle.

01:32:52.829 --> 01:32:54.091
Cheers.

01:32:54.164 --> 01:32:56.029
Good luck.

01:33:10.881 --> 01:33:12.746
Better than yesterday.

01:33:21.758 --> 01:33:24.056
Do you want to have sex again?
- Yeah.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:35.000
