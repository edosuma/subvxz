[Alder]
Welcome to Fort Salem.

00:04.352 --> 00:05.962
Some of you
will place at War College,

00:06.049 --> 00:08.225

the front lines.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.967
-The Spree are ruthless.
-[people screaming]

00:11.054 --> 00:13.578
This was your mama's. Wear it
in combat, keep you safe.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.493
[Raelle] I think my mom
was tired when she died.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.278
-[Izadora] Did you touch that?
-Is it dangerous?

00:17.365 --> 00:18.931
It's just better
if it's left alone.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.281
Let's just say it's
part of a mushroom.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.326
-I'm Adil.
-[Abigail] He's cute.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.198
Can I eat my breakfast before
you start planning my wedding?

00:24.285 --> 00:26.635
Awfully nice to meet your
girlfriend, Raelle.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.463
No matter what happens,
I'm with you.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.466
I saw a balloon.
I think Scylla is Spree.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.598
-How'd you get out?
-[Scylla] Anacostia helped me.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.774
What if we can send her back
to them to be our eyes?

00:35.861 --> 00:37.820
You were supposed to
bring me my daughter.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.823
Our ancient enemy has returned!
This is the Camerilla!

00:40.910 --> 00:42.738
-She's dying!
-Take me!

I couldn't risk it.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.163
How could you send me in blind?!

06:21.250 --> 06:24.166
You burned me with the Army
for a personal mission.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.907
And then you sent
that charming agent

06:25.994 --> 06:27.474
to choke me into compliance?

06:27.561 --> 06:29.040
And when I don't deliver Raelle,

06:29.127 --> 06:31.303
you send in the troops

06:31.391 --> 06:32.957
That, my dear, was not us.

is that, exactly?

08:10.185 --> 08:12.317
I want you to join me

08:12.404 --> 08:14.755
Our mission is not about
the Army, anymore.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.408
At least, for me.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.019
And why would I
do anything for you?

08:18.106 --> 08:19.542
Because you are a witch!

Do you have any idea
what this means for my family?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.974
Abigail is the last viable--

09:00.061 --> 09:02.716
It was Abigail's choice to come,
and a brave one, at that.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.281
What say the Rangers
and the Tarim?

09:46.368 --> 09:48.326
Nothing conclusive.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.329
The blast radius
continues to warp climate

09:51.416 --> 09:53.070
in ways that are visible to us.

09:53.157 --> 09:56.204
What is most curious is that,
while diminishing,

09:56.291 --> 09:59.076
the blast zone is noticeably
on the move.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.780
General Bellweather, you
must take the time you need--

10:06.867 --> 10:09.434
Soldier first, mother second.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.610
Right?

10:21.969 --> 10:24.536
I just received intelligence
that the Spree was attacked

10:24.624 --> 10:27.061
a week ago in Belgium,
just before the soccer stadium.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.454
At least six major operatives
were taken down

10:29.541 --> 10:30.891
by weaponized plagues.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.544
The same plague
that took our Biddy.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.894
And almost killed Khalida.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.417
The Tarim are a lure.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.594
To get me out in the open.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.336
They dressed that poor woman
like my sister.

Burned my soldiers before
my eyes, like the old days.

-The Camarilla.
-I should've believed you.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.605
I was blinded by my own trauma.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.739
They found some way,
not just to dampen our work,

10:52.826 --> 10:54.610
but proximate it.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.786
-In a crude but effective way.
-How?

10:56.873 --> 10:59.920
The vocal chords.
The Camarilla took their voices

11:00.007 --> 11:03.053
and contrived some way
to use the necrotized tissue.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.751
They wanted it to
look like the Spree

11:04.838 --> 11:06.404
so they could bide their time.

11:06.491 --> 11:09.103
And harvest our voices
to use them against us.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.801
Excuse me, Generals. I believe
you'll want to see this.

[scoffs] You're assuming
we're getting back.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.677
They must have Rangers

15:46.249 --> 15:49.122
Even if you don't.
It's the right thing to do.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.386
Thank you.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.257
Don't Bellweather me.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.433
You don't get to decide
what's the right thing to do.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.522
Abigail, why should we trust
Alder with this?

15:58.609 --> 16:00.263
Do you trust me?
Because I basically

16:00.350 --> 16:02.831
just followed you
into death, sis.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.485
[footsteps approach]

16:05.660 --> 16:07.923
Lieutenant, we have something
we'd like to discuss--

16:08.010 --> 16:10.360
You two must have been up to
some really wild stuff.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.449
I've just been ordered
not to debrief you.

16:13.885 --> 16:17.367
[pounds] Off you go.
Goddess help you.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.979
[engine revs]

16:26.637 --> 16:29.162
[indistinct chatter]

16:31.164 --> 16:33.340
Vice President Lanton Silver.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.002
[sighs]

16:47.702 --> 16:49.095
How's your daughter?

16:49.182 --> 16:51.749
The picture of bravery
and composure,

16:51.836 --> 16:53.316
-as per usual.
-Hm.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.015
Unlike me, on the other hand.
[chuckles]

16:56.102 --> 16:59.279
So, I need you to explain to me
one more time,

16:59.366 --> 17:02.021
What is-- What is this
matriline?

17:03.848 --> 17:05.937
Our men are born
with the work in them,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.635
just like their sisters,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.463
and some of them
are quite powerful.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.205
But they don't pass it
to their offspring.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.859
So, our government
tracks witch-hood

17:14.946 --> 17:18.341
along the maternal line,
the matriline.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.301
So, you're saying that
my wife was, um...

17:21.388 --> 17:22.998
-one of you?
-[inhales sharply]

17:23.085 --> 17:24.826
But she didn't know
and she definitely

17:24.913 --> 17:26.654
[chuckling]
didn't melt any windows.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
So, how exactly does that work?

17:28.221 --> 17:29.657
There are many reasons why

17:29.744 --> 17:31.833
people lose touch
with their histories.

17:31.920 --> 17:34.749
Some choose to hide
from their duty.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.794
Your wife probably had
some inkling

17:36.881 --> 17:39.145
that she was one of... us.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.800
Well, unfortunately,
we can't ask her.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.672
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:44.759 --> 17:48.110
But we won't know for sure
until we test Penelope.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.199
All of this is a bit premature.

17:50.286 --> 17:53.333
I'm sure you understand
how delicate this is,

17:53.420 --> 17:54.899
considering who I am.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.901
You've already met
Sergeant Quartermain.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.512
She helps new conscripts--

17:58.599 --> 18:00.557
It's probably best
just to get to the point.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.169
I'm concerned that Penelope
will become a target.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.996
We appreciate your concerns.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.738
But if we do find the work
in Penelope,

18:07.825 --> 18:10.654
she must deliver herself
bodily to Fort Salem

18:10.741 --> 18:12.743
for training in
the military arts.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.528
-[clears throat]
-It's the law of the land.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.051
No exceptions.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.488
So, you're asking me
to give you my daughter?

18:18.575 --> 18:21.056
And my daughter's daughters,
in perpetuity.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.058
As our kind have done
for centuries,

18:23.145 --> 18:24.625
to keep this country safe.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.889
And you can keep Penelope safe?

18:27.976 --> 18:29.804
Can you actually
guarantee her safety?

18:32.502 --> 18:35.984
Don't worry, Mr. Vice President,
we take care of our own.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.954
[brakes squeal]

18:52.783 --> 18:54.742
[thunder rumbles]

18:58.485 --> 18:59.790
Oh!

19:06.493 --> 19:07.885
-I'm sorry--
-Don't.

19:07.972 --> 19:11.585
I am so very proud
of what you did.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.935
It was a classic
Bellweather move,

19:14.022 --> 19:16.807
against the odds,
in the face of oblivion,

19:16.894 --> 19:19.027
full of grit and
the kind of sisterhood

19:19.114 --> 19:20.898
this Army was built on.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.858
You may be the greatest
Bellweather yet, my daughter.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.862
Is there any chance
we could see Tally?

19:27.949 --> 19:29.342
Oh!

19:35.565 --> 19:38.438
[chuckles] Uh, come along,
that's where I'm taking you.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.874
We-we don't have much time.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.747
I won't take the second chance
for granted.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.314
I love you, daughter.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.621
I love you too, Mom.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.539
[vocalizing in harmony]

20:01.896 --> 20:04.203
[vocalizing continues]

20:06.857 --> 20:08.076
[door opens]

20:10.557 --> 20:11.601
[door closes]

20:13.777 --> 20:15.562
[high pitched ring]

20:24.832 --> 20:26.094

20:26.181 --> 20:29.097
[electrical zapping]

20:31.491 --> 20:32.579

20:38.715 --> 20:40.587
[gasping]

20:44.895 --> 20:46.680

20:50.858 --> 20:52.555
[tinkling fades]

21:03.262 --> 21:05.481
[vocalizing resumes]

21:16.884 --> 21:18.189
[exhales]

21:20.583 --> 21:22.455
[vocalizing in harmony]

21:24.500 --> 21:26.676
[crackling]

21:29.157 --> 21:30.637
[gasps]

21:31.942 --> 21:33.379
Are you real?

21:33.466 --> 21:35.381
[chuckles]

21:35.468 --> 21:37.774
-Hm.
-[gasps]

21:51.222 --> 21:53.573
-Hi.
-Hi!

21:53.660 --> 21:56.315
[girls all giggle]

21:57.490 --> 22:00.188
-[laughs]
-Tally.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.887
What happened?

22:03.974 --> 22:06.412
We wanna ask you that.
You're-- You're you.

22:06.499 --> 22:09.240
-[chuckles]
-She let me out.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.590
Did you mess up?

22:10.677 --> 22:12.069
God, she promised
it wasn't that

22:12.156 --> 22:13.941
and I am trying to believe her.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.291
I mean, guys, you dream
for years to be a Biddy.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
-Could you hear her thoughts?
-Sort of?

22:18.424 --> 22:21.601
Surface stuff. Like, directives,
I could hear loud and clear.

22:21.688 --> 22:22.993
Not so much memories.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.691
And I could hear
the Biddies, too.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.823
It was like being in a car
with the same people

22:26.910 --> 22:28.303
on a road trip
that never ends.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.349
No privacy, like, ever!

22:30.436 --> 22:32.263
Okay, so, does she
really not eat?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.048
No, not a morsel.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
Loves her wine.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.965
Why are we talking about wine?
[laughs]

22:38.052 --> 22:39.706
You guys are alive!

22:39.793 --> 22:42.970
That explosion, that
was you two, right?

22:43.057 --> 22:45.581
How did you do that?

22:45.668 --> 22:48.932
Uhh, we don't know,
exactly, but, um...

22:49.019 --> 22:50.499
it was definitely us.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.588
It was so big.
You guys are a bomb.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.851
-[laughs]
-Yeah, but, uh,

22:54.938 --> 22:57.811
Rae doesn't think we should
tell Alder what we can do.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.640
Well, we just-- We-we
don't even know what it is yet,

23:00.727 --> 23:02.337
you know, or-or
if we can do it again.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.991
So, don't you think
we should wait?

23:04.078 --> 23:06.341
And also, Alder's Alder,
let's not forget--

23:06.428 --> 23:07.908
Meaning?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.954
Wow, a little defensive.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.001
[sighs]

23:14.088 --> 23:16.873
I know she's complicated,
but I believe in her.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.399
Look, complicated or not, she's
the head of the Armed Forces.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.357
Who else are we gonna
show what we can do?

23:22.444 --> 23:23.489
Uh, how 'bout no one?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.055
Those people who ambushed us

23:25.142 --> 23:26.883
are the same people
that killed Charvel.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.495
-And how do you know that?
-They had the same tech.

23:29.582 --> 23:32.411
This sonic shit
that blocks vocal work.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.242
This thing we can do
can help us fight them.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.340
I thought you were dead.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.690
We thought you were old.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.127
[laughs]

23:58.306 --> 24:00.569
[Khalida] You're tired.
When you're recovered,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.963
we should continue
to search for home.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.574
[sighs] Why not here?

24:05.661 --> 24:07.228
You know how I feel
about this place.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.056
After everything Alder's
done for us,

24:09.143 --> 24:11.885
for our people and what's left?

24:11.972 --> 24:13.669
[scoffs] Why is this
the worst place?

24:13.756 --> 24:15.541
Is this because Abigail's back?

24:15.628 --> 24:17.194
Perhaps.

24:17.281 --> 24:19.327
It's more about not wanting
to run anymore.

24:19.414 --> 24:21.242
[thunder rumbles]

24:21.329 --> 24:22.852
[scoffs]

24:24.680 --> 24:28.118
We should at least
consider our options.

24:33.515 --> 24:34.821
You're right.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.345
Again.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.087
Come on.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.484
[Adler] So, the Camarilla agent
stabs you,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.355
and then, you link with her.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.837
Yes, ma'am. But Raelle
was too messed up to move.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.013
I was just keeping her alive
at that point.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.102
I told her to
break the link with me

24:55.189 --> 24:57.104
or else I would
pull her into death.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.627
And you maintained the link?

24:58.714 --> 25:00.760
Correct. There was
another Camarilla--

25:00.847 --> 25:02.718
Is this the person
who stabbed Raelle?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.285
No, I don't think so.

25:04.372 --> 25:07.114
It's very important that we get
the details right.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.811
We could definitely do that.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.770
We could break everything
down to powder

25:10.857 --> 25:12.423
and put it in neat little piles.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.035
Or, we could cut to the chase.

25:19.866 --> 25:20.910
[sighs]

25:23.086 --> 25:24.523
The blast was us.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.962
We don't know how,
but this force

25:29.049 --> 25:30.877
protects us
when we're threatened.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.836
While we don't understand this
work yet, we will master it.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.408
Let's continue to
break this down...

25:41.714 --> 25:42.889
to powder.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.239
Yes, ma'am.

25:49.896 --> 25:50.984
[dog barks in distance]

25:51.071 --> 25:52.551
How many did they get?

25:55.162 --> 25:56.250
Six.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.514
Women I've known for years.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.648
Bright, brilliant,
dangerous women,

26:02.735 --> 26:04.040
gone, like that.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.609
The leadership that remains

26:07.696 --> 26:09.437
is none too happy
with what I did next.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.180
After Brussels,
I was put in charge

26:13.267 --> 26:15.269
of the attack on
the soccer stadium.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.620
You don't any of this?

26:18.707 --> 26:20.187
No. Well--

26:20.274 --> 26:22.842
Thanks to your mission,
I was locked up.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.365
I switched it up.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.280
I traded catastrophe
for information.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.498
[wood creaking]

26:27.586 --> 26:29.675
I warned all witches everywhere

26:29.762 --> 26:32.939
that the Camarilla is back.
I hope they heard me.

26:34.418 --> 26:35.898
[creaking]

26:35.985 --> 26:37.944
That's a fetch.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.381
[Willa] We're on the move.
She's been tracked.

26:40.468 --> 26:44.690
[vocalizing]

26:48.607 --> 26:49.912
[whooshes]

26:57.746 --> 27:00.140
Is there anything else
you soldiers want to share?

27:00.227 --> 27:01.837
It's all we can remember.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.534
Good.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.450
I want you to train them
to wield this new gift,

27:06.537 --> 27:09.236
immediately. Dismissed.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.846
Actually, I had a few questions.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.587
For example?

27:12.674 --> 27:15.372
I wanna know who those
people were. The Camarilla.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.723
And I wanna know how they're
connected to Charvel's death,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.420
because I know that they are.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.031
Abigail, I'm going to order you
to stand down on this.

27:22.118 --> 27:25.644
They attacked my family.
They almost killed me.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.082
I wanna fight these people
with everything that I have.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.562
You need to let more experienced
soldiers handle this.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.434
How can I stand down?

27:33.521 --> 27:36.567
[Adler] By putting that passion
into your training, cadet.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.831
Master this new weapon
as promised.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.051
Then we can talk about
the Camarilla.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.967
That's an order.

27:59.634 --> 28:00.853
[gasps]

28:06.685 --> 28:09.165
[breathing heavily]

28:12.603 --> 28:14.170
I really missed you.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.129
Me, too.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.566
I thought you were dead.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.831
-[chuckles softly]
-I'm so happy to see you.

28:22.918 --> 28:26.400
[sighs] I don't think
I've ever been this happy.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.532
I know. Me, too.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.409
[Khalida] I have
something for you.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.633
Thank you, so much.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.158
This was my mom's.

28:45.245 --> 28:48.161
I know. And I know
you saved that boy.

29:27.026 --> 29:30.290
Well, I am so glad you're back.
When am I gonna see you?

You know, um, I don't even know
what our situation is, yet.

29:33.293 --> 29:36.383
So, I guess we could get
redeployed soon.

Uh-huh. You sound
just like your mom.

29:38.646 --> 29:40.300

29:41.475 --> 29:44.260

but somebody
brought it back to me.

[Edwin] Well, I'm not
surprised, in the least.

find you anywhere.

Okay. Hey, hey, uh...

that girl you liked?
