00:02.503 --> 00:03.602
       [knocking at door]

00:03.604 --> 00:05.371
           - Police!
            Open up!

00:05.373 --> 00:07.339
              Ooh!
         - [screaming]

00:07.341 --> 00:08.507
     - [imitating gorilla]

00:08.509 --> 00:11.276
    - What the bloody hell?

00:11.278 --> 00:14.446
          - [laughing]

00:16.049 --> 00:17.216
     Are you okay, marcus?

00:17.218 --> 00:19.251
      - Here we go again.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.720
        - Past Halloween
      emotional scarring.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.188
        He doesn't like
       to talk about it.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.358
     - No. It's okay, mom.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.694
    I'm going to tell will.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.163
           It's 2009.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.765
           I'm seven.

00:32.767 --> 00:35.234
   It's just another average
        run of the mill

00:35.236 --> 00:36.368
       Trick-or-treating
        with my mother.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.071
             - Oh.
           So sorry.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.339
          - That's not
      the traumatic part.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.473
         - Keep going.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.709
       - This kid dressed
        as frankenstein

00:43.711 --> 00:46.211
   Just comes up and just...

00:46.213 --> 00:48.514
     Just smashes this egg
          on my head.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.315
         - And we knew
 it wasn't organic, didn't we?

00:50.317 --> 00:51.817
          - It's 2011.

00:51.819 --> 00:56.622
   This vicious dog just gets
  enraged by my bunny costume.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.224
         Just chases me
         and chases me.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.161
     - I mean, I found you
 holed up in a little doghouse.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.296
       - I may or may not

01:04.298 --> 01:06.165
     Have eaten some kibble
       to sustain myself.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.766
        But the point is

01:07.768 --> 01:10.335
   I have a Halloween curse.
            - Yeah.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.304
            - Look,
   some bad luck in the past.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.106
   Some questionable judgment
        with the kibble.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.341
    But are you going to let
  a couple of bad experiences

01:16.343 --> 01:18.777
   Ruin the greatest holiday
          of the year?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.179
       Which, by the way,
        is why I'm here.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.747
         Come with me.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.315
         Look at this!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.284
              Hmm?
        Feast your eyes.

01:25.286 --> 01:26.852
     This is how it's done.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.387
        Even if I called

01:28.389 --> 01:32.324
   Those two pathetic pieces
      of corn decoration,

01:32.326 --> 01:35.394
   They are for thanksgiving,
         not Halloween.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.629
   - How many bloody holidays
      do you people have?

01:37.631 --> 01:40.199
      - None as important
         as Halloween.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.267
           I, myself,
     throw an annual party

01:42.269 --> 01:44.369
      That is legendary--
          will-o-ween.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.838
         - Will-o-ween?
           - Uh-huh.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.372
      Anyway, the point is

01:47.374 --> 01:49.274
          I'm going to
      the Halloween store

01:49.276 --> 01:52.444
        To get even more
      of this wonderment,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.413
       And you are coming
            with me

01:54.415 --> 01:56.281
    Because you need to make
     your side of the porch

01:56.283 --> 01:58.183
         A little less
       suicide-inducing.

01:58.185 --> 01:59.885
       We're going to be
      loaded to the gills

01:59.887 --> 02:02.588
    With trick-or-treaters,
    and we need to be ready.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.491
      - Yeah, no, we don't
        give out treats.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.827
         - Halloween is
 a made up american holiday...

02:08.829 --> 02:11.497
     Invented to encourage
     obesity and diabetes.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.532
     - Mom hasn't had sugar
          in 12 years.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.334
            - Yeah.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.469
  - That's not all your mother
hasn't had in 12 years, marcus.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.904
             - Hey.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.339
         Un-hear that.

02:20.341 --> 02:25.310
  [brett dennen's <i> comeback kid</i>

           woman: Oh!

02:52.473 --> 02:54.173
            - Sorry.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.375
       - Um...Can we go?
      This place is awful.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.910
             Look.
       That could be me.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.444
     - Uh, no it couldn't.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.813
    But, yeah, maybe someone
     will forget a costume.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.215
           High five?
             - Ah!

03:03.217 --> 03:06.852
   That--you're only getting
      decorative markers?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.754
           - I've had
        a brilliant idea

03:08.756 --> 03:09.755
           For making
     some Halloween treats.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.756
              Ah!

03:10.758 --> 03:12.257
     - I highly doubt that.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.392
 - Don't you think you're going
        a bit overboard

03:13.394 --> 03:16.395
   - 'cause I'm not supposed
     to be spending as much

03:16.397 --> 03:19.498
  Because my "royalty" checks
     have "stopped coming"?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.700
       - Why do you keep
  putting things in air quotes

03:21.702 --> 03:23.702
  That are actually happening?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.671
       Do you think maybe
   you're throwing this party

03:25.673 --> 03:28.874
     To mask your feelings
 about your break-up with sam?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.475
           - I'm not
      masking them, fiona.

03:30.477 --> 03:31.677
       I am mending them.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.279
   Every time life throws me
        a major setback,

03:34.281 --> 03:36.381
   I throw a three bs party.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.583
          - Three bs?
           - Mm-hmm.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.750
        - What is that?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.986
       Brown rice buyers
       and baba ghanoush?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.854
      - Please don't ever
          make jokes.

03:42.856 --> 03:46.425
     No, it's booze, bros,
           and babes.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.560
        - You loved her.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.397
     You can't fill a void
      with three bs, will.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.666
        - Oh, trust me,
             I can.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.568
    It's worked in the past.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.972
      This three bs party
 is going to cleanse my system.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.474
   It's going to get me back
       to classic will--

04:02.476 --> 04:04.910
            Will 1.0

04:04.912 --> 04:07.846
         - Will, will,
      listen to me, okay?

04:07.848 --> 04:10.482
  You cannot bury your sadness
       that is in here--

04:10.484 --> 04:11.950
      Oh, I feel the void,
          I feel it--

04:11.952 --> 04:15.020
  With parties and strangers.
      My hands don't lie.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.456
       You have to mourn
   the end of a relationship.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.591
       You--getting back
    to your life before sam

04:19.593 --> 04:21.459
         Is going to be
        very, very hard.

04:21.462 --> 04:24.596
       It's a long road.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.965
     - That's a good point.
            - Yeah.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.434
    - Would you like to come
   to a party tomorrow night?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.570
    - That sounds like fun.
          - [chuckles]

04:31.572 --> 04:32.804
          I'm rachel.
        - Hi, I'm will.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.040
           Will 1.0.

04:35.042 --> 04:39.278
  What do you have in the vein
  of like adult bouncy houses?

04:41.482 --> 04:42.414
           [knocking]

04:44.284 --> 04:46.051
         - We're busy.
   - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.420
     I'm just dropping off
  andy's tonto costume. Okay.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.755
            - Okay.
         - Settle down.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.957
   He's not going to need it.
      - Hey. Check it out.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.393
 - We're doing a family costume
           this year.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.460
    Andy and I are the pods,

04:55.462 --> 04:57.429
  And these guys are our peas.
            - Mm...

04:57.431 --> 04:58.597
     - That's cute, right?
           - Mm-hmm.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.631
      - Andy, don't move.
        I got to go get

04:59.633 --> 05:00.966
        The hot glue gun
        for your crotch.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.701
      - Why does the glue
 need to be hot for the crotch?

05:02.703 --> 05:04.303
  - Dude, what are you doing?
            - What?

05:04.305 --> 05:06.605
 - We always go to will-o-ween
    dressed as a famous duo.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.774
  I can't have you showing up
       dressed like a...

05:08.776 --> 05:11.043
       Giant green penis.
        - I'm a pea pod.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.444
         - Take a look
      in the mirror, dude.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.346
        You are a penis.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.616
     And I need you there.
We got the cotton candy machine,

05:17.618 --> 05:19.584
         We got the dj,
 we got the margarita machine,

05:19.586 --> 05:22.454
    We got the photo booth.
 - Whoa. You're doing three bs?

05:22.456 --> 05:23.889
             - Yes!
  - This is going to be epic.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.490
           - Exactly.
     And that's why I need

05:25.492 --> 05:27.359
         My bro there,
     and I need him to look

05:27.361 --> 05:29.628
        A lot less like
    the jolly green weiner.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.463
          - All right,
       this is the plan.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.465
  Me, laurie, and the kids are
 going to go trick-or-treating,

05:33.467 --> 05:35.600
 Then we're going to come over
      to your house late.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.735
         Laurie's going
        to be exhausted.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.736
          She's going
       to want to leave.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.571
    I wear the tonto costume

05:39.573 --> 05:41.606
           Underneath
     this pea pod nonsense,

05:41.608 --> 05:43.375
      And then me and you
            bro down

05:43.377 --> 05:46.611
    - Wouldn't it be easier
     just to get a divorce?

05:46.613 --> 05:47.646
          - Ha-ha-ha.
       That's hilarious.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.780
      Hey, here's an idea.
            - Yeah.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.515
  - Why don't you go as tonto?

05:50.517 --> 05:51.817
      I go as lone ranger
         for a change.

05:51.819 --> 05:52.984
       What do you think
          about that?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.053
           - [laughs]

05:55.055 --> 05:56.588
            - What?
     Just to switch it up.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.557
     - Yeah, get in there.
         Don't be shy.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.558
       Go shoulder deep.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.393
           [growling]

06:01.395 --> 06:03.628
          - Thank you.
    - Yeah, happy Halloween.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.998
             - Hi!
 Look at what I've got for you.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.734
      Sweets for the soul.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.536
   Little baseball lady bird.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.840
      - Mom, it's a rock!

06:14.842 --> 06:16.575
          - Oh, honey.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.543
       - I don't want it.
             - Oh.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.945
        - Come on, kids.
         Let's get away

06:19.947 --> 06:21.079
    From the mean rock lady.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.647
   - No, it's lovely, it's--

06:22.649 --> 06:25.717
       - Are you serious?
             Rocks?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.954
   - Well, they're not rocks.

   - No. He's my other half.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.507
   And it's not will-o-ween.
        It's Halloween.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.477
  It's a holiday for children,
          so grow up.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.245
        - No, it's not.
       - Let's go, andy.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.114
         Come on, guys.
      - Wait, come on, no.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.115
       Seriously, please.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.216
       You can't do this.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.084
           - Come on.
       - All right, well,

13:40.086 --> 13:42.954
  Take off the tonto costume.
            - What?

13:42.956 --> 13:45.423
         - You've lost
      sidekick privileges.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.059
   You have been de-tontoed.

13:52.598 --> 13:55.166
             - Oh.
              Wow.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.035
    Gosh, that's beautiful,
           isn't it?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.570
        - Oh, thank you.
      You, uh, caught me.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.872
- Do you make low income housing
        for gummy bears?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.208
          - [chuckles]
    well, I am an architect.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.109
             - Oh.
     - Ah, yes, but, um...

14:05.111 --> 14:06.511
   I've just been struggling

14:06.513 --> 14:08.279
  With this cantilevered roof
           all week,

14:08.281 --> 14:10.315
        And now at least
     I can safely say that

14:10.317 --> 14:12.517
        A vanilla wafer
       is not the answer.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.920
             - Aww.
           [chuckles]

14:15.922 --> 14:17.288
     - I normally don't eat
          this stuff.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.224
         - No, I know.
It's terrible for you, isn't it?

14:19.226 --> 14:21.259
   - Yeah, but it's so good.
            - Is it?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.027
             - Mmm.
              Mmm?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.896
       - Oh. Yeah. Okay.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.364
    I'll have one of those.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.569
     - Oh, that's actually
     bloody good, isn't it?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.171
       - That's not bad.
            Not bad.

14:33.173 --> 14:37.075
            Another?
          - Um...Okay.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.076
            I will.
           [chuckles]

14:38.078 --> 14:39.244
           - Cheers.
           - Cheers.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.648
   We're going to get really
     sugar high, aren't we?

14:43.650 --> 14:48.052
     - Does dr. Rachel need
        to examine you?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.320
     Stick out your tongue.
          - [laughing]

14:49.322 --> 14:50.889
           - Come on,
     stick out your tongue.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.523
           [laughing]
     and make out with me.

14:52.525 --> 14:55.260
       - I-I, uh ,I think
     you got to maybe like

14:55.262 --> 14:56.995
     Put the doctor thing,
      like, tone it down.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.330
             - Ohh!

14:59.332 --> 15:02.267
        You seem upset.
           [chuckles]

15:02.269 --> 15:03.468
         Turn your head
       and cough for me.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.937
         [phone rings]
   - yeah, that's a good one.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.305
      Hold on one second.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.073
             Um...

15:10.409 --> 15:12.477
             Uh...
           [ringing]

15:12.479 --> 15:15.446
         Um, I got to--
      I got to take this.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.416
         I--stay here.
     I-I'll be right back.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.285
       Hello, sam, hello?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.352
          - Hey, will.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.455
         Sorry, I, um,
          for calling.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.257
       I-I didn't know if
  it would upset you, I just--

15:26.259 --> 15:27.692
        - No, no, it's--

15:27.694 --> 15:30.261
   It's--I'm glad you called.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.264
        - I just wanted
      to hear your voice.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.066
      - It's nice to hear
        your voice too.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.535
   - It's so loud over there.
      What are you doing?

15:37.537 --> 15:41.105
        - Fiona's having
       a Halloween party.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.608
             Fiona!
    Keep it down over there!

15:43.610 --> 15:47.211
     - I-I didn't go to any
  Halloween parties this year.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.580
         Wasn't really
          in the mood.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.683
            - Um...

15:51.685 --> 15:54.519
      - Yeah, no, me too.
           I-I just--

15:54.521 --> 15:56.354
      - How are you doing?

15:56.356 --> 15:59.590
         - I'm doing...

15:59.592 --> 16:02.060
        Not--not great.
              Ha.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.666
       - Well, happy, um,
     happy Halloween, will.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.302
 - Yeah, happy Halloween, sam.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.204
            - Um...

16:13.206 --> 16:15.640
   Tell marcus I said, "hi,"
  next time you him him, okay?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.709
        - Yeah, I will.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.251
       Are you in there?
            - Will?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.387
           - Marcus?
         - Will, help.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.055
    I can't breathe in here.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.290
- Hey, sam, hold on one second.
       Hold on a second.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.259
            [grunts]
        [booth groaning]

16:35.261 --> 16:37.462
         What happened?

16:37.464 --> 16:38.730
         You okay, man?

16:38.732 --> 16:40.665
   - No, will, I'm not okay.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.467
          I told you,
          I'm cursed.

16:45.771 --> 16:49.407
      - Sorry about that.
          Um, sa-sam?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.742
              Sam.

16:57.349 --> 16:57.582
               .

16:57.584 --> 16:59.550
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.052
      - What are you doing
           out here?

17:01.054 --> 17:04.255
       - Oh, you know...

17:04.257 --> 17:07.392
             Ahh...

17:07.394 --> 17:08.792
        I'm just taking
       a break, you know?

17:08.795 --> 17:11.496
    When a party's this fun,
         you got to...

17:11.498 --> 17:12.797
         Pace yourself.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.666
   - I wish I could move past
    stuff as easily as you.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.803
   I mean, you just broke up
         with dr. Sam.

17:18.805 --> 17:23.608
    But all it took was you
   throwing this great party,

17:23.609 --> 17:27.811
      And it's--it's like
      she never happened.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.481
            - Yeah.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.351
            [sighs]
         you know what?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.586
       Will-o-ween sucks.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.522
    Let's break this curse.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.659
        I'm going to be

17:41.661 --> 17:45.263
  - You're really filling out
    the tonto costume well.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.231
     - I think I should be
        the lone ranger.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.633
        Trick or treat.
        - There you go.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.371
       - Trick or treat.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.840
 - Okay, we're doing all right.
          - All right.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.142
 - ¶ oh, I feel it in my soul ¶

17:58.144 --> 18:01.112
      [candies clattering]
          - oh, sorry.

18:01.114 --> 18:05.083
      - ¶ I know we've got
  that time to come together ¶

18:05.085 --> 18:06.451
     - I've never even had
        this much sugar.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.785
  - ¶ fill it up, put it up ¶

18:07.787 --> 18:10.822
           [rapping]

18:10.824 --> 18:14.292
              ¶ ¶

18:14.294 --> 18:15.293
        - Scoop, scoop!

18:15.295 --> 18:16.294
            - Oh...

18:16.296 --> 18:18.129
          Chug! Chug!
          Chug! Chug!

18:18.131 --> 18:19.130
             Chug!
             Chug!

18:19.132 --> 18:20.865
           Too much.
             Sorry.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.133
        [doorbell rings]

18:22.135 --> 18:24.135
          - ¶ go, go ¶

18:24.137 --> 18:26.504
             - Hey.
          - ¶ go, go ¶

18:26.506 --> 18:28.473
           - Stop it!
      - Stop, please stop!

18:28.475 --> 18:31.375
     [overlapping shouting]
       - ¶ go go go go ¶

18:31.377 --> 18:32.643
     - ¶ let's do it right,
            ready? ¶

18:32.645 --> 18:33.878
      ¶ one, two, three ¶

18:33.880 --> 18:36.614
  ¶ oh, I feel it in my soul ¶

18:36.616 --> 18:38.749
   ¶ got parties on my mind ¶

18:38.751 --> 18:42.587
    ¶ I know we've got that
    time to spend together ¶

18:42.589 --> 18:44.555
    ¶ I let my candle flow ¶

18:44.557 --> 18:46.624
 ¶ got tingles down my spine ¶

18:46.626 --> 18:50.128
  ¶ we're gonna make this time
         last forever ¶

18:50.130 --> 18:51.796
          ¶ hey hey ¶

18:51.798 --> 18:53.865
             ¶ ow ¶

18:53.867 --> 18:55.867
  - This is a rite of passage,
            marcus.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.902
         Whoo-hoo-hoo!

18:57.904 --> 18:59.904
          - Fire away.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.207
              ¶ ¶

19:03.209 --> 19:06.611
         - Bombs away!

19:06.613 --> 19:07.812
     - Thank you very much.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.914
        That was really
  the nicest Halloween I've--

19:09.916 --> 19:13.151
  - Well, then, in that case,
           you know,

19:13.153 --> 19:15.586
   I feel like, um, perhaps--

19:15.588 --> 19:18.222
         Uh, so sorry.
       I-I can't remember

19:18.224 --> 19:19.590
       What your name is.
             - Oh.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.225
    It's princess glucosea.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.394
         My people have
        low blood sugar

19:23.396 --> 19:25.930
     And I should probably
       get back to them.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.503
             - Mm.
        [clears throat]

19:32.505 --> 19:35.740
    You know, a wise person
        once told me to

19:35.742 --> 19:37.875
  "be open to unexpected love
         and kindness."

19:37.877 --> 19:40.511
    - I got one right then.
          - [chuckles]

19:40.513 --> 19:42.180
        Good night then.
            - Night.

19:45.584 --> 19:49.587
      - Oh, ho-ho, ho-ho.
             Okay.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.190
   So what was your favorite
        part of tonight?

19:52.192 --> 19:55.193
    - Seeing andy get egged.
          - [chuckles]

19:55.195 --> 19:57.962
      - I really think the
 Halloween curse is broken now.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.731
 I mean, it's the best holiday
       of the year, man.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.967
        - You know what?
    I think I just had to go

20:02.969 --> 20:04.735
     With the right person.
            - Well,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.572
     You're in, andy's out.
        That's for sure.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.940
     Next year, we're going
     as maverick and goose.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.275
        - Yeah, I know,
      but I'll teach you.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.476
          - All right.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.613
       You know, will...

20:15.615 --> 20:19.217
         I really miss
          dr. Sam too.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.485
       - She's very easy
            to miss.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.921
         - Look, I know
    it may not be the same,

20:23.923 --> 20:25.656
       But until you find
          another sam,

20:25.658 --> 20:28.926
     I'm available to hang.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.395
        - Thank, buddy.
         - No problem.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.497
   - Listen, I think the key
        for Halloween...

20:33.499 --> 20:35.366
           - Mm-hmm.
   - Is to eat all the candy

20:35.368 --> 20:36.434
         In one night.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.240
           - Look at
      all those wrappers.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.975
      Do you think he ate
           all that?

20:43.977 --> 20:45.977
       - Oh, no, no, no.
 Yeah, see, his window's open.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.979
     I'm sure most of them
      got sort of blown in

20:47.981 --> 20:49.347
          By the wind.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.982
    - I actually don't think
       it's a bad thing.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.350
       I think it's good
          to sometimes

20:52.352 --> 20:54.285
          Step outside
       your comfort zone,

20:54.287 --> 20:56.954
          And have fun
      in a different way.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.289
           - Really?
             - Mmm.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.358
   - So, how was your night?

21:00.360 --> 21:02.660
         You get any...
             Sugar?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.328
    - Well, I might have had
            a taste.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.596
             - Oh.
            - Yeah.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.465
           - Lovely.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.268
     Anyway, I believe this
           is yours.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.604
   Someone hurled it through
     my window last night.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.874
      - Oh, maya angelou,
         so beautiful.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.978
 Do you know I've actually set
 a lot of her poetry to music?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.913
   - I'm never going to want
       to hear it, okay?

21:22.915 --> 21:26.284
       - ¶ be a rainbow ¶
      - stop it, stop it!
