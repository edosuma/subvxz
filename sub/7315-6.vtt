WEBVTT

00:04.070 --> 00:06.472
(alarm blaring)

00:06.474 --> 00:09.074
Force protection alert.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.144
Confirmed hostile target
approaching inbound.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.313
Initiate emergency
evacuation procedures.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.348
Move it! Move it!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.217
Let's go! Let's go!

00:18.219 --> 00:20.719
Safety perimeter
has been breached.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.221
(alarm blaring)

00:22.223 --> 00:23.756
60 seconds to impact.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.290
All personnel
to the lifeboat deck.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.593
56, 57, 58...

00:27.595 --> 00:31.196
Come on, machaca. Come on.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.731
30 seconds to impact.

00:32.733 --> 00:36.368
59 souls accounted for.
Stop the clock.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.503
Three minutes, 40 seconds.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.771
Copy that.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.439
Drill complete.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.341
(alarm stops)

00:43.176 --> 00:44.643
That was pathetic,
machaca.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.512
I could have crawled
down here faster.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.347
Lighten up, ops.
It's just a drill.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.581
Are we done?

00:49.583 --> 00:51.550
Chow's getting cold down there.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.387
(loud explosion)

00:55.389 --> 00:57.523
(yelling)

00:57.525 --> 00:59.792
Explosion on the bridge.
Explosion on the bridge.

00:59.794 --> 01:03.128
This is not a drill.
Repeat, this is not a drill.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.464
(yelling and shouting)

01:37.430 --> 01:38.730
Mcgee, I thought we said

01:38.732 --> 01:40.432
No mischief-night pranks
this year!

01:40.434 --> 01:41.600
Whoa!

01:43.470 --> 01:44.703
Nice.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.871
That kind of precision--

01:45.873 --> 01:48.607
Whoever did this has
some serious skills.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.376
I mean,

01:51.378 --> 01:53.579
"oh, no. Oh, god, it's awful.
How dare they."

01:53.581 --> 01:54.880
So, this wasn't
your handiwork?
No.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.316
You're not the one
that defiled my lab?
What?

01:57.318 --> 02:02.254
Someone moved my work table
three inches to the right.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.223
Oh, gee, how dare they.
I know.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.757
Whoever did it knows
that I would notice

02:05.759 --> 02:08.594
If there was even a hair
out of place.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.330
We're dealing
with a sadistic evil genius.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.732
(humming)

02:13.734 --> 02:16.735
I think you got half
that equation right.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.836
Oh!

02:17.838 --> 02:20.172
What have we here?

02:20.174 --> 02:22.174
I'm glad to see you took
our little conversation

02:22.176 --> 02:24.510
About safe agenting seriously,

02:24.512 --> 02:26.311
But that's a little overboard,
mcribbed.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.514
You've had your fun, tony;
unwrap it.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.649
Oh, gosh, I'm flattered,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.584
But unfortunately,
that prophylaxis

02:32.586 --> 02:34.386
Is not the work of yours truly.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.356
Who knows? The great pumpkin?
Headless horseman?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.658
Perhaps the ghost
of Halloween past?

02:39.660 --> 02:40.726
Mike franks?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.227
The possibilities are endless.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.529
Not for our dead marine.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.597
Grab your gear; we're
going to virginia beach.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.635
Got a new desk, mcgee?

02:49.637 --> 02:50.702
Not exactly, boss.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.737
Sure looks new to me.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.273
Let's go.
(tony chuckles)

02:54.275 --> 02:55.774
Mcgee:
<i>I was the first one in</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

02:55.776 --> 02:57.876
So the prank was pulled
sometime last night,

02:57.878 --> 03:00.479
And you were at the office
after I left.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
I had dinner plans.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.315
What time?

03:03.317 --> 03:04.917
Uh, I don't recall.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.318
I left at midnight,
dinozzo.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.519
You were still
at the office.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.955
Area's on lockdown, sir.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.790
Got a dead body in
my jurisdiction, petty officer.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.460
So if that's a problem,
you can take it up with her.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.668
What are you doing, boss?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.303
You heard the man.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.271
We wait.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.706
Wait?
Wait for what?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.907
The person in charge, dinozzo.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.809
You're looking at her.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.412
Agent borin, I should've known.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.948
Well, the coast guard presence
was a pretty big clue.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.416
What do you got, borin?
One explosion

03:37.418 --> 03:39.351
On board an offshore
oil platform

03:39.353 --> 03:40.919
Plus the body
of one dead marine

03:40.921 --> 03:42.421
Equals on big mess

03:42.423 --> 03:44.289
For ncis and cgis.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.691
What caused the blowout?
No idea yet.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.259
We can't get on board
the platform

03:47.261 --> 03:48.961
To process the scene
until the fires are contained

03:48.963 --> 03:51.396
And the platform's deemed
structurally sound.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.798
So all we've got is a body?
And the statements

03:52.800 --> 03:54.566
From the crew, all 59 of them.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.368
So, might want to get started.

03:57.537 --> 03:58.537
Yeah, go.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.005
(scoffs)

04:00.007 --> 04:03.508
It's good to see the team
hasn't changed too much, gibbs.

04:03.510 --> 04:07.946
I'm sure leaving couldn't have
been an easy decision for her,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.781
And we've all been there.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.383
You got a body for me, borin?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.485
Yeah.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.721
The victim is marv hebner.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.656
He was on the bridge at the time
of the explosion.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.458
Divers pulled his body
from the water this morning.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.692
His upper torso

04:20.694 --> 04:22.394
And face took the brunt
of the damage.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.595
Shrapnel damage is superficial.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.765
Won't know that
until ducky examines him.
Trust me.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.868
I've seen my share
of blast-impact trauma up close.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.504
But I'm sure dr. Mallard

04:32.506 --> 04:34.973
Will be able to confirm
our suspicions.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.342
Tony:
<i>You were in communication</i>

04:37.344 --> 04:38.610
With hebner during the drill?

04:38.612 --> 04:39.945
Right up to the explosion.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.546
And last he reported,

04:41.548 --> 04:42.948
All systems were normal.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.351
You know, I've spent years
working on oil rigs.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.620
I never seen anything
like this happen before.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.390
I mean, we have warning signs,
alarms, fail-safes.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.891
Well, if hebner was the only one
manning the controls,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.893
Is it possible he overlooked
one of the warning signs?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.495
Human error?

04:56.497 --> 04:59.064
(grunts) marv's the most
experienced man on the rig.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.499
This guy wasn't the type

05:00.501 --> 05:01.600
To make mistakes.
I'm paige hebner.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.868
I need to see...
I'm looking for...

05:02.870 --> 05:04.836
No, there he is.
No, I got to see him. Jonah!

05:04.838 --> 05:07.306
It's marv's wife.
Jonah.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.774
Hey, paige.

05:08.776 --> 05:09.908
It's not him, right?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.376
It is.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.978
I'm so sorry, paige.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.646
(sobbing)

05:14.648 --> 05:15.781
Mrs. Hebner,

05:15.783 --> 05:17.549
Sorry for your loss.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.986
I don't understand.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.788
I just talked to marv
last night

05:22.790 --> 05:24.756
On the phone,
and everything was fine.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.025
What happened?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.493
We're trying to figure that out.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.896
Where is he?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.765
Please?

05:34.867 --> 05:36.535
(sobbing)
hey, come on.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.769
Come on.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.805
Mcgee:
<i>No one on board</i>
<i>recalls anything</i>

05:39.807 --> 05:41.740
Out of the ordinary
before the explosion.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.542
Systems checked out normally.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.676
Average day.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.944
Didn't end that way.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.112
Command center got a call
from the captain

05:47.114 --> 05:48.613
Of a cargo freighter.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.349
He recalled passing a motorboat

05:50.351 --> 05:51.717
With nonfunctioning
running lights

05:51.719 --> 05:53.552
Near the platform last night.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.020
Mcgee: Think this could be
some kind of terrorist attack?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.855
Tony: Certainly wasn't
a booze cruise.

05:57.824 --> 05:59.691
Officer:
Excuse me, agent borin?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.562
Thanks.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.098
Homeland security's put
all u.S. Oil installations

06:06.100 --> 06:07.699
On heightened alert.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.135
So this is either
an isolated incident or...

06:10.137 --> 06:12.003
It's the beginning
of more to come.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.417
Tony (chuckling):
Timmy,

06:25.419 --> 06:27.719
You fell prey to one of the
oldest pranks in the book.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.988
I guess that's why the classics
never go out of style.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.090
Lack of imagination
and individuality?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.024
Sounds like your m.O.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.526
Don't be mad at me.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.794
I didn't do anything.

06:35.796 --> 06:36.995
You know what it is?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.797
You make yourself
too easy of a target,

06:38.799 --> 06:40.499
Mcbull's-eye.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.667
You need to keep moving.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.002
Now, me,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.003
I like a challenge.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.938
Pulling one over on gibbs,

06:46.940 --> 06:49.141
That would be a
feat for the ages.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.675
What do you have? A death wish?

06:50.677 --> 06:52.544
(à la sean connery):
I like to live dangerously.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.479
Our dead marine;
let's go.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.847
Marv hebner,

06:55.849 --> 06:57.182
45,

06:57.184 --> 06:58.984
Major in the selected
marine corps reserve

06:58.986 --> 07:01.420
With the
combat engineer battalion.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.822
Completed three tours
in iraq and afghanistan.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.090
His most recent
deployment ended

07:05.092 --> 07:06.758
Eight months ago,
when he returned

07:06.760 --> 07:08.126
Working for cityline oil.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.628
It's a mid-level oil company

07:09.630 --> 07:11.430
With an impeccable
safety record.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.064
Until now, of course.
Updates from homeland?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.900
Well, they're keeping
the threat level raised,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.902
But there's no chatter,
and no terrorist group

07:16.904 --> 07:19.204
Has claimed responsibility
for the explosion.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.540
The oil biz has benham parsa
written all over it.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.608
Gibbs: Fbi?
Mcgee:
They don't think
there's a connection.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.911
Intel shows that parsa's
still underground.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.113
Navy and coast guard
have air support out

07:28.115 --> 07:29.781
Searching for the rogue boat
(phone ringing)

07:29.783 --> 07:31.049
Reported by the cargo ship.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.684
Yeah, it's gibbs.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.053
What?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.688
Where?

07:37.657 --> 07:39.491
Porter:
Agent gibbs.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.660
Thank you for joining us
in director vance's absence.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.662
Let me introduce you

07:43.664 --> 07:45.464
To perry davidson,

07:45.466 --> 07:46.865
Ceo of cityline oil,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.133
And their lead counsel,
brett creevy.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.534
Davidson:
We want you to know

07:49.536 --> 07:51.236
That cityline is
using all means

07:51.238 --> 07:53.705
At our disposal to get to
the bottom of this mess.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.942
If we can assist in any
way, please let us know.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.844
The last thing we want
is another gulf oil disaster

07:58.846 --> 07:59.978
On our hands.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.680
The white house
couldn't agree more.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.915
It's why they've assigned me
to oversee this investigation.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.250
Davidson:
Marv hebner

08:05.252 --> 08:06.551
Was a member

08:06.553 --> 08:07.953
Of the cityline family.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.588
It's a profound loss.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.491
Mr. Creevy and I toured
that platform

08:12.493 --> 08:14.192
Earlier yesterday morning.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.094
I never would've imagined
this could happen.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.830
And we've known our platforms
might be a potential target

08:18.832 --> 08:20.165
For a terrorist attack.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.969
We prepare for it,
but it's still shocking.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.504
I think it's a little premature
to assume

08:25.506 --> 08:30.609
I'm sure ncis is keeping
all investigative paths open.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.811
Davidson:
Well, if it was an
attack, it wasn't

08:32.813 --> 08:33.812
A very strategic one.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.946
How do you mean that?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.849
It's a matter of output
and manpower.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.120
Of the oil compared to our
other rigs on the east coast,

08:42.122 --> 08:44.222
And it's manned by a crew of 60.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.891
The others have over 200.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.126
Fallout from a larger platform

08:48.128 --> 08:50.862
Would've been devastating.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.963
Our priority
is to address

08:51.965 --> 08:53.899
The cause of this incident

08:53.901 --> 08:56.868
And figure the best way
to minimize the damage.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.270
A man's dead.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.839
Hard to minimize that.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.708
Ducky:
<i>For centuries,</i>

09:03.710 --> 09:05.210
All hallows' eve

09:05.212 --> 09:08.280
Was a time of celebration
and superstition.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.782
It's thought to have originated

09:10.784 --> 09:13.885
With the celtic festival
of samhain,

09:13.887 --> 09:16.121
Where followers
would light bonfires

09:16.123 --> 09:20.025
In an effort to ward off
roaming ghosts

09:20.027 --> 09:22.093
And lurking evil spirits.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.630
(beep)
ah!

09:25.632 --> 09:27.098
Did you hear something?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.900
Anyway,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.870
Halloween has
since evolved into,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.838
Of all things,
a children's holiday.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.307
Eager faces,

09:35.309 --> 09:38.176
Some dressed
in questionable <i>déguisement</i>

09:38.178 --> 09:41.580
(door opens)
going from door to door
in search of trick or treat.

09:41.582 --> 09:46.184
Agent borin, I'd heard our paths
were about to cross again.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.652
Well, word travels fast.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.821
Well, I can't imagine
that I'm the only one

09:49.823 --> 09:52.657
Who's glad to have you back
in our little flock,

09:52.659 --> 09:54.092
Albeit temporarily.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.360
(beep)
(grunts)

09:55.362 --> 09:57.195
Uh, dr. Mallard?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.229
Did you hear that?

09:58.231 --> 10:00.799
Hear what?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.067
A faint beep.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.302
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
(chuckles)

10:04.304 --> 10:05.337
(door opens)

10:05.339 --> 10:06.605
Where was I?

10:06.607 --> 10:07.606
You tell me, duck.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.673
Ah, jethro.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.208
I was about to confirm

10:10.210 --> 10:12.077
What you two
have already deduced.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.612
Major hebner's body

10:13.614 --> 10:16.081
Did indeed receive a
significant amount of trauma

10:16.083 --> 10:17.616
From the blast,

10:17.618 --> 10:20.085
But none of his internal organs,

10:20.087 --> 10:22.687
His vital ones, were affected.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.222
What was the cause
of death, then?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.690
Well, this man drowned.

10:25.692 --> 10:29.227
I suspect this contusion
rendered him unconscious

10:29.229 --> 10:30.962
Before he entered the water.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.733
(phone ringing)

10:36.869 --> 10:38.136
Hey, borin.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.171
(phone continues ringing)

10:40.173 --> 10:42.374
Excuse me.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.708
Borin.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.243
You got anything else, duck?

10:45.245 --> 10:46.978
Well, I pulled
a significant amount

10:46.980 --> 10:48.980
Of material
from the major's skin.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.117
These gold fragments
are the most curious.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.819
I was about to send
them up to abby

10:54.821 --> 10:56.921
For analysis.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.658
(beep)
oh, there it is again!

10:59.660 --> 11:02.293
Where is that confounded
beep coming from?

11:02.295 --> 11:04.362
Patrol found our
rogue motorboat

11:04.364 --> 11:06.998
Dead in the water five miles
south of the platform.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.768
Traced it back to a cruiser
yacht who reported it scuttled

11:09.770 --> 11:11.136
In rough seas last week.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.337
We got to board that platform.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.005
Yeah, well, you're in luck--
the fires are out

11:14.007 --> 11:15.674
And we can process
our crime scene.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.043
You know, major...

11:18.045 --> 11:21.379
I believe
there is mischief afoot.

11:22.882 --> 11:26.117
What do <i>you</i> think?
(beep)

11:26.119 --> 11:28.186
♪

11:30.222 --> 11:32.857
Abby?

11:32.859 --> 11:34.059
Fire!

11:34.061 --> 11:35.293
There's a fire!

11:39.465 --> 11:41.332
Mcgee?
It's okay.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.434
Don't panic.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.902
Do I look panicked?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.336
Actually, no.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.338
It's sage, mcgee.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.709
I'm purifying my sanctuary
of the negative karma

11:50.711 --> 11:52.343
Left by the Halloween prankster.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.045
Don't you think you're
going a little overboard?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.481
I mean, I don't like it when
tony touches my stuff, either,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.450
But I just use bleach.
Well,

11:58.452 --> 11:59.918
We're not certain that it's him,

11:59.920 --> 12:02.053
So we have to take
all precautions.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.755
Abby, you said you
found something?

12:03.757 --> 12:06.057
I did. This is
the operating mainframe

12:06.059 --> 12:08.026
On board the oil platform.

12:08.028 --> 12:11.162
I reviewed all their system
functions up to the explosion,

12:11.164 --> 12:13.765
And just like the crew said,
everything was normal.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.801
I found nothing.
I thought you said
you found <i>something.</i>

12:16.803 --> 12:19.337
Well, the nothing...
Is the something.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.173
Abby, are you sure you
didn't ingest any of that sage?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.075
Maybe.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.812
I found hidden malware
installed on their server.

12:27.814 --> 12:28.947
It's a rootkit,

12:28.949 --> 12:31.049
So it gave the hacker access

12:31.051 --> 12:33.818
To everything on board
without being detected.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.420
Which means someone could
have manipulated the systems,

12:35.422 --> 12:38.356
Remotely causing the blowout
without triggering any alarms.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.158
How was it downloaded
onto the platform?

12:40.160 --> 12:46.264
Who would open a file from
"enlarge and in charge"?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.833
We might have another way
to trace our programmer.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.369
Hackers tend to think
of themselves as artists.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.204
Some even find a way
to sign their work.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.174
It's usually embedded somewhere
in their coding sequence.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.209
Let's see if
our picasso left a mark

12:58.211 --> 13:00.311
That we can use to I.D. Him.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.781
Who's in charge <i>now?</i>

13:03.949 --> 13:06.050
(people chanting)
tony: Which one's our techie?

13:06.052 --> 13:08.286
Mcgee:
Danielle benton.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.889
Advanced computer engineering
degree from carnegie mellon.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.092
Tony: We live
in a strange world, mcgee.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.828
I miss the days when
computer nerds looked like you.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.063
Mcgee:
Danielle benton.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.965
Ncis. We need
to speak with you.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.034
(people continue chanting)

13:24.537 --> 13:26.271
The navy.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.239
Polluters of
our oceans.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.108
Killers of innocent
marine life.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.011
I didn't know they
put that in the brochure.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.079
Does this look familiar?

13:37.116 --> 13:39.450
Looks like the
computer program

13:39.452 --> 13:42.086
I designed for
my thesis project.
Mmm.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.154
Bs in terrorism?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.489
Terrorism?
Yeah,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.157
Your little number jumble
was installed

13:46.159 --> 13:50.195
On board cityline's
oil platform before it exploded.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.263
I don't know anything
about that.
Then how did

13:52.265 --> 13:54.566
The program you designed
end up in their system?

13:54.568 --> 13:56.501
I published it online
three years ago.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.136
It's a college paper.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.038
Anyone could have
duplicated it.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
But that code couldn't
have caused an explosion.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.076
Why is that?
It's designed to be a tool

14:05.078 --> 14:07.278
For anti-corporate
intelligence gathering,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.914
Accessing records and internal
communications data.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.583
There's no input
function capability.

14:11.585 --> 14:15.053
It's looky... No touchy.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.588
She's right.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.056
Looky, no touchy.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.924
Didn't they teach you
that at m.I.T.?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.192
Computer
programming's

14:21.194 --> 14:23.928
Changed a lot since y2k.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.431
Time for a refresher.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.534
Sorry, mcgeek,
you've been dethroned.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.369
All hail the queen.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.605
(chuckles)
I'm driving.

14:37.476 --> 14:40.411
(low, deep creaking)

14:40.413 --> 14:42.580
Uh, no, no,
it's not through there.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.650
Uh, the bridge is... Further
down under the helipad.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.619
You've been on board
here before?

14:47.621 --> 14:50.221
Nah, I just know my
way around a rig.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.056
For my last tour
in the marines,

14:52.058 --> 14:53.625
I was with a
security detachment

14:53.627 --> 14:57.295
On the al-kashir
oil platform in iraq.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.631
All right, here we are.

15:02.301 --> 15:05.303
Hebner was running a
drill from this space.

15:06.505 --> 15:10.174
Well, that explains how
he got in the water.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.245
Al-kashir--
that was considered

15:14.247 --> 15:16.247
A hazardous duty
assignment, right?

15:16.249 --> 15:18.049
Yeah.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.652
We were a constant target.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.422
Boat raids, suicide bombers--

15:24.424 --> 15:27.358
Threats came
in all shapes and sizes.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.693
Any close calls?

15:28.695 --> 15:31.029
Yeah, once...

15:31.031 --> 15:33.097
On a routine patrol.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.400
Got a distress signal
from a local fisherman

15:35.402 --> 15:37.068
With his young son.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.439
We spotted the vessel, pulled up
alongside for inspection.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.243
While we were still boarding,
an ied went off.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.180
Lost three men;
a few more seconds,

15:49.182 --> 15:50.615
I would've been with them.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.219
It was a long
time ago, gibbs.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.522
I'd rather focus
on finding out what the hell

15:57.524 --> 15:59.390
Caused this explosion.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.192
I think we just have.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.232
Yeah, well...

16:08.234 --> 16:11.703
(sighs)
that's the detonator.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.371
Or what's left of it.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.140
Well, there's goes the accident
theory I was hoping for.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.143
You know, of all the spaces
to plant a bomb, why the bridge?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.045
If you want to take down a tree,

16:21.047 --> 16:23.247
You do it at the base,
not the branch.

16:23.249 --> 16:25.650
Maybe it wasn't about the space.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.687
The platform wasn't the target.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.756
Marv hebner was.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.500
Creevy: A detonator?
You're suggesting

16:42.502 --> 16:44.535
One of our men planted a bomb
on the platform?

16:44.537 --> 16:45.770
That's insane.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.772
Davidson: Every
cityline employee

16:47.774 --> 16:49.374
Is properly vetted
and goes through

16:49.376 --> 16:51.109
An extensive background
investigation--

16:51.111 --> 16:52.577
Before they're hired.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.413
No one had any red flags.
Gibbs:
Someone does now.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.181
Was marv hebner
having any problems

16:57.183 --> 16:58.783
With a particular
crew member?

16:58.785 --> 17:03.221
I was aware of a falling-out
he had with jonah mcguire,

17:03.223 --> 17:06.758
About what?
Mcguire was cited
for a safety violation

17:06.760 --> 17:08.726
During a recent osha inspection.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.262
The company decided
to let mcguire go.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.398
It was a decision
that hebner signed off on.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.033
Did mcguire know he
was being let go?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.467
Paperwork was
still being finalized,

17:16.469 --> 17:18.669
But he saw
the writing on the wall.

17:18.671 --> 17:22.206
That's not just a red flag;
that's a motive.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.742
Why would someone want
to kill marv?

17:24.744 --> 17:26.411
We were hoping
you could tell us.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.546
I have no idea.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.050
Sounded like you had
a pretty big ax to grind.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.484
Then you're misinformed.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.686
Marv was my closest friend.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.689
Signing your termination papers
wasn't too friendly.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.159
Friends are supposed
to have your back,

17:41.161 --> 17:42.293
Not stab you in it.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.761
Mcguire:
That's not what it seems.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.164
I wasn't angry over him
for getting fired.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.598
It was my idea.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.467
That makes no sense.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.269
There's a lot of that
going on today.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.603
Mcguire:
Marv was the one

17:52.605 --> 17:55.440
At fault for that
safety hit, not me.

17:55.442 --> 17:59.377
I took the fall because I knew
what the consequences would be.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.447
So you lied in order to get
fired-- still not making sense.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.715
Mcguire: You don't understand
what the job meant to marv.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.718
And an osha infraction
would have ruined his career.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.087
I-I...

18:09.089 --> 18:10.388
I couldn't let
that happen

18:10.390 --> 18:12.356
After all the things
he'd done for me.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.459
I didn't kill him.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.160
I was...

18:16.162 --> 18:18.796
Was trying to protect him.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.566
(elevator bell dings)

18:21.568 --> 18:23.167
Perfect timing, as always.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.469
Borin:
You're expecting me?

18:25.437 --> 18:26.537
Agent abby!

18:26.539 --> 18:28.139
I'm so glad to see you!

18:28.141 --> 18:30.341
I mean, I'm not glad about
the "dead body" situation

18:30.343 --> 18:32.310
And all, but I'm just, I'm
really happy that you're here.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.113
And how about... Now?

18:35.115 --> 18:37.715
Oh. That is a lot of affection
for some caffeine.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.717
I should come around more often.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.385
Yes.

18:41.387 --> 18:44.522
I agree with that 110%.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.458
Although that's not
numerically possible,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.660
For emphasis,
it totally works.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.896
Happy I can help.
Well, now it's my
turn to help you.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.598
What do you got, abbs?
I'm still

18:53.600 --> 18:55.533
Processing the debris
from the platform--

18:55.535 --> 18:57.235
It's gonna take some time--

18:57.237 --> 18:58.603
But I can give you
some information

18:58.605 --> 18:59.637
About the bomb itself.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.239
That's good. No.
Not really.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.273
The cell phone detonator is

19:02.275 --> 19:03.908
A disposable,
so there's no trail.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.911
And the explosive device,
the main ingredient

19:06.913 --> 19:08.646
Was pure black powder.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.482
Which isn't regulated, making it
nearly impossible to trace.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.785
We do know that the bomb had
minimal damage payload,

19:14.787 --> 19:16.487
So we're not dealing
with some professional

19:16.489 --> 19:19.924
But it didn't need to be.
With all flammable gasses

19:19.926 --> 19:22.293
And materials on board
that platform,

19:22.295 --> 19:24.195
All they needed was
the right ignition point

19:24.197 --> 19:25.563
To set off a
chain reaction.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.698
Which brings me
to my next interesting fact.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.933
Based on the device's

19:28.935 --> 19:31.235
Blast radius,
it was placed

19:31.237 --> 19:33.804
In the one spot on the bridge
where a chain reaction

19:33.806 --> 19:36.207
Wouldn't take out
the entire rig.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.508
Either they got

19:37.510 --> 19:38.809
Really lucky...

19:38.811 --> 19:40.711
Or our bomber had
intimate knowledge

19:40.713 --> 19:42.813
Of the platform's
structural layout.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.916
I don't believe in luck.

19:44.918 --> 19:47.618
That's good work, abbs.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.890
(speaking indistinctly)

19:54.860 --> 19:57.295
I got an uneasy feeling, mcgee.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.930
Well, I told you
not to order chinese

19:58.932 --> 20:00.965
From a mexican
restaurant.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.301
I'm talking about secnav.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.536
She's been hanging around
here a lot lately.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.738
Don't speak ill
of josé the mandarin.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.840
His egg rolls are <i>muy bueno.</i>

20:09.842 --> 20:11.976
Look, this is ncis,
porter's the secnav--

20:11.978 --> 20:13.578
She's just doing her job.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.246
I had this same
bad feeling

20:15.248 --> 20:17.848
Back when I was at ohio
state my sophomore year.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.817
They brought in
a new head coach.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.552
New coach means
new lineup.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.222
You think secnav's looking
to switch things up around here?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.423
Don't worry, I got your back.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.325
Every team needs a water boy.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.360
Gibbs:
Where are we?

20:29.362 --> 20:30.561
Hey, boss.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.963
Uh, verified
the background checks

20:31.965 --> 20:34.298
On the cityline employees--
nothing noteworthy.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.334
Fines for public intoxication,

20:36.336 --> 20:37.735
Delinquent car payments

20:37.737 --> 20:39.737
And some serious
1-900 charges to a guy

20:39.739 --> 20:41.439
Who's clearly never
heard of the internet.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.874
I've got something.
The entire food service team

20:43.876 --> 20:45.476
On board the platform was hired

20:45.478 --> 20:46.644
Through a third-party vendor.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.279
Which means
they didn't have

20:48.281 --> 20:49.513
To go through cityline's
background check.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.615
They still wouldn't have
proper clearance

20:50.617 --> 20:51.616
To access the bridge.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.683
Anyone with a
criminal record?

20:52.685 --> 20:53.751
Mcgee:
Um...

20:54.720 --> 20:56.687
...Lenny pachaca, a line cook.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.956
Working under the alias
"lenny machaca."

20:58.958 --> 21:02.293
Hmm. Didn't really think outside
of the box on that one, did he?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.895
He did time for possession and
transportation of explosives.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.430
Dinozzo, get borin,
bring him in.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.565
Will do.

21:21.046 --> 21:23.547
I love
that smell.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.383
Rotting fish carcass
and diesel fuel?

21:25.385 --> 21:26.884
Yeah,
breathe it in.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.486
You're a special lady,
borin.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.587
I can't wait
to meet

21:29.589 --> 21:30.788
The peg-legged gentleman
who woos you.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.356
Yo-ho-ho,
dinozzo.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.357
Lenny machaca?

21:33.359 --> 21:35.326
Tony:
Hey...

21:35.328 --> 21:36.927
Oh, come on...
I'll cut him off.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.638
(horn honking)

21:51.743 --> 21:53.411
Tony:
Ooh.

21:53.413 --> 21:56.347
(groans)

21:56.349 --> 21:58.783
College softball.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.950
Southpaw?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.652
I swung both ways.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.966
I think this crazy bitch
broke my ribs.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.501
Trust me, len...

22:17.503 --> 22:18.769
You want to quit
while you're ahead.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.004
And you're still breathing.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.740
I already told you...

22:22.742 --> 22:23.874
You've got the wrong guy.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.378
Only people with something
to hide run from the cops.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.579
And use aliases.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.914
I see what you're
trying to do,

22:29.916 --> 22:31.615
But you're not
pinning this to me.

22:31.617 --> 22:35.386
I didn't do it.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.854
Well, you also claimed

22:36.856 --> 22:39.056
That you didn't have
any issues with marv hebner,

22:39.058 --> 22:40.825
Yet your
supervisor says

22:40.827 --> 22:42.760
He made complaints about you.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.395
Said you were a loose cannon.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.796
You unpredictable, len?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.665
Bet you didn't like him
keeping you in line.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.867
He was a tightly-wound hard-ass.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.436
Rode everyone like
a damn drill sergeant.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.704
This wasn't the marines.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.140
Guess he finally pushed
the wrong guy too far.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.709
The wrong guy with a criminal
background in explosives?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.878
Because there's only
one guy on board

23:00.880 --> 23:02.480
That meets that criteria,
and that's... That's you.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.714
Tony:
Arrested for possession

23:03.716 --> 23:05.516
Of c-4,
chargers,

23:05.518 --> 23:07.685
Blasting caps,
and gunpowder.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.086
(chuckling):
Oh, lenny...

23:09.088 --> 23:11.422
Old habits die hard.

23:11.424 --> 23:12.623
That was a long time ago,
all right?

23:12.625 --> 23:13.758
My friend
and I

23:13.760 --> 23:15.126
Got a kick out of
blowing stuff up.

23:15.128 --> 23:16.594
No one got hurt.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.529
We were just having fun.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.565
It was fun?
Yeah.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.768
Just a way to goof off.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.736
Never saw what
the big deal was, so...

23:25.738 --> 23:27.972
Borin:
Have... Have you ever seen
what that kind of fun does

23:27.974 --> 23:30.141
To the human body
at close range, lenny?

23:30.143 --> 23:31.909
No?

23:31.911 --> 23:32.910
Let me enlighten you.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.911
It starts with a...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.513
A sudden flash of light.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.449
Comes out of nowhere.

23:38.451 --> 23:39.583
You're temporarily blinded,

23:39.585 --> 23:42.086
But trust me,
that's a blessing,

23:42.088 --> 23:43.854
Because the last
thing you want to see

23:43.856 --> 23:45.189
Is what's about
to happen to you.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.190
And then there's
the sound.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.726
You have ever heard
in your entire life.

23:48.728 --> 23:49.994
It's also the last sound

23:49.996 --> 23:51.195
You're ever gonna hear.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.997
And then there's
the silence.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.567
And you can't even
hear yourself scream

23:56.569 --> 23:58.068
As the heat
from the blow-back

23:58.070 --> 23:59.570
Melts your skin

23:59.572 --> 24:01.639
And the shrapnel
tears through your body!

24:01.641 --> 24:03.040
So why don't you
tell me, lenny...

24:03.042 --> 24:05.576
Are we having fun yet?
Huh? This fun for you?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.144
I'm done listening to this.
Oh, my god,
you're so not.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.446
Hey, we've just started.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.780
So why don't you
stay where you are?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.115
(door opens)
gibbs:
Agent borin.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.888
Take a break.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.697
Look, I only
used an alias

24:26.699 --> 24:28.199
Because I couldn't
get a job with my record.

24:28.201 --> 24:30.634
All right?
I have a family
to provide for.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.136
That's all I've done,
I swear.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.939
I'll take a polygraph
or whatever, just...

24:34.941 --> 24:37.475
Keep her away from me.

24:40.946 --> 24:43.914
Well, I was always partial
to the green dragon tavern.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.049
Tuesdays they
would host...

24:45.051 --> 24:46.717
American history
triviology.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.519
I know,
I went every week.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.154
Okay, what about
outside cambridge?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.923
Tough choice,
but I'm gonna
have to go with...

24:52.925 --> 24:54.725
Boss.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.093
Didn't see you
come in.

24:57.629 --> 24:58.662
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.864
Porter:
We were just discussing

24:59.866 --> 25:01.799
Our academic history
in boston.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.601
M.I.T.,
harvard.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.870
(phone ringing)
excuse me.

25:05.872 --> 25:08.205
Thanks for the trip
down memory lane, tim.
Yes, ma'am.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.674
Porter.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.676
What did you
find out?

25:12.678 --> 25:17.014
She wrote for the <i>crimson,</i> she
was a member of the debate club,

25:17.016 --> 25:18.148
Graduated magna cum laude.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.750
About the case, mcgee.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.051
Oh.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.219
Right.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.822
Well, since his, uh,
release from prison,

25:24.824 --> 25:26.023
Lenny has kept
his record clean.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.291
I confirmed
his alibi

25:27.293 --> 25:28.826
With two of the
other onboard cooks.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.794
They say he was working
all day on the mess decks

25:30.796 --> 25:31.795
Up until the drill.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.130
That's not much of a lead.

25:33.899 --> 25:36.100
This is.
Check it out.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.836
Schematics of

25:38.838 --> 25:40.571
Cityline's
oil platform.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.573
The firm who
designed the plans

25:42.575 --> 25:44.775
Had a minor security
breach two weeks ago.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.877
This was the only file
that was compromised.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.145
What kind
of breach?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.680
It was the same
type of malware

25:49.682 --> 25:50.881
We found on
cityline's mainframe.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.249
One person they have in common.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.318
Danielle benton.

25:55.854 --> 25:56.987
Find her, mcgee.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.023
Bye-bye.

26:17.008 --> 26:19.143
I thought that move
was pure urban legend.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.878
Something you
care to share,

26:20.880 --> 26:22.880
Madam secretary?
Pardon me?

26:22.882 --> 26:24.648
Is there another reason
for your presence here,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.150
Besides this
investigation?

26:26.152 --> 26:27.217
Matters of my agenda

26:27.219 --> 26:28.752
Are above your pay grade,
agent gibbs.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.888
If it involves me
or my team,

26:30.890 --> 26:31.889
I respectfully
disagree.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.959
Rest assured,
my presence at ncis

26:34.961 --> 26:36.594
Is purely case-specific.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.662
You have your orders.
So do I.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.132
However, as a person with
a background in business,

26:42.134 --> 26:43.901
I would be remiss

26:43.903 --> 26:46.070
If I didn't notice
certain gaps

26:46.072 --> 26:47.972
In this office when
it comes to manpower.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.673
Staffing issues are
below your pay grade.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.775
Not if it's affecting the
efficiency of this agency.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.711
It isn't.
I agree.

27:00.719 --> 27:03.754
I'm not here to mark my
territory, agent gibbs.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.055
It's your team.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.757
You run it
as you see fit.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.692
As long as I keep
seeing results,

27:08.694 --> 27:10.260
We won't have
an issue.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.997
(elevator bell dings)

27:14.666 --> 27:15.866
If it ain't broke...

27:17.802 --> 27:19.670
(dings)

27:29.180 --> 27:31.081
Gibbs:
Here you go.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.218
Yeah, sure,
I can use another round.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.758
Well...
Say something, gibbs.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.959
Kind of waiting
on you, borin.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.094
I'm the one who's
in the dark.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.930
Look, I-I shouldn't have
taken this case.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.066
I knew it would just...

27:49.068 --> 27:51.201
Dredge up too many things
I didn't want to revisit.

27:52.771 --> 27:53.771
Well, maybe if
you knew that,

27:53.773 --> 27:54.838
It's why you
took the case.

28:00.845 --> 28:04.048
I still remember
every detail
of that day in iraq.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.153
I'd play it over and over
and over in my head,

28:09.155 --> 28:12.356
Just, you know,
thinking...

28:12.358 --> 28:14.124
Of all the stuff

28:14.126 --> 28:16.860
I could've
done differently.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.796
Signs I missed.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.268
Losing a man in combat,
it stays with you.

28:26.137 --> 28:29.840
I didn't just lose three
fellow marines in that blast.

28:32.277 --> 28:34.411
Gibbs, I lost <i>my</i> marine.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.749
Liam...

28:40.952 --> 28:43.954
He always had to be the one
leading the charge, you know?

28:43.956 --> 28:45.055
That was his style.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.758
He was, uh... Strong.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.027
Stubborn, god...

28:50.029 --> 28:52.329
Cocky as all hell.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.965
A marine's marine.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.803
I saw him
board the vessel...

28:59.805 --> 29:03.373
I saw the blast take him...

29:03.375 --> 29:07.044
And I saw what was left when
I pulled him from the water.

29:09.914 --> 29:13.350
That was just something
I couldn't come back from.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.419
(phone ringing)

29:19.257 --> 29:20.924
Yeah, dinozzo?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.926
Boss, we've tracked
danielle benton's cell

29:22.928 --> 29:24.461
To a marina outside
hampton roads.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.363
Mcgee's sending you the address.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.432
Okay, we'll
meet you there.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.267
About ready to go?
I'm driving.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.870
No, after everything
that's happened,

29:32.872 --> 29:34.138
I think it's
best for everyone

29:34.140 --> 29:35.906
If I just pull out
of the case.

29:35.908 --> 29:40.277
They can assign you
another agent...
No, borin,
not happening.

29:41.813 --> 29:42.980
My case, my call.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.549
You pulling rank
on me, gunny?

29:47.085 --> 29:48.418
A marine leaves
no man behind.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.556
(engine rumbling)

29:52.558 --> 29:54.825
(seagulls calling)

29:55.994 --> 29:58.128
Make sure we're
fueled and ready.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.297
I want to be out of here
before the tide shifts.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.033
Don't leave yet.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.968
Who the hell
are you?

30:04.970 --> 30:08.405
I already answered
ncis's questions.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.574
If you want more I.T. Support,
try the genius bar.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.809
You taking a trip?

30:11.811 --> 30:15.846
Surveying the ecological impact
of coastal shipping routes

30:15.848 --> 30:17.014
On local whale migration.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.850
And yes, we have a permit.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.518
Tony:
Boss...

30:21.520 --> 30:24.254
Watch 'em.
What do you got?

30:26.024 --> 30:27.090
Crabs.

30:28.159 --> 30:30.127
We have a problem.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.528
Worse than dinozzo's crabs?

30:33.031 --> 30:35.499
It's black powder.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.501
And there are more than
50 buckets like it down there.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.469
That's enough to level
this entire marina.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.852
(door opens)

30:59.591 --> 31:01.625
Don't worry, you'll get
used to loud noises in prison.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.460
And with what
we found on board,

31:03.462 --> 31:06.196
You're in for an extended stay.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.365
Containers of gasoline,
black powder, and soap.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.967
Also known as
"vegan napalm"

31:09.969 --> 31:12.369
In environmental
extremist circles.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.372
I've never seen those
containers before in my life.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.107
Must be
the captain's.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.375
I'm innocent.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.043
Told you
she'd say that.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.378
He did;
he said you'd say that.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.347
He also said you'd lean back
and cross your arms.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.648
He did the whole thing,
it was very good.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.116
He also said that you would

31:26.118 --> 31:27.985
Be a little surprised
when you found out

31:27.987 --> 31:30.120
That we discovered your...
Hiding spot

31:30.122 --> 31:32.256
Underneath the wheel-house
floorboard.

31:32.258 --> 31:35.492
Building plans,
surveillance photos,

31:35.494 --> 31:37.527
And security
access codes

31:37.529 --> 31:39.463
Belonging to
ten biotech labs

31:39.465 --> 31:40.631
Across the
east coast...

31:40.633 --> 31:42.666
Each hit by the
same arsonist.

31:42.668 --> 31:46.069
Too bad you didn't think to wipe
your prints off all these.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.604
Christmas came early this year
for the fbi.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.639
Boo-ya.

31:48.641 --> 31:50.307
"boo-ya"?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.075
What is that?

31:52.077 --> 31:55.312
Those labs
were conducting invasive

31:55.314 --> 31:57.447
And unethical tests
on innocent animals.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.217
What they do isn't research;
it's torture.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.353
I did what was necessary
to save lives.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.655
Well, you didn't seem to mind

32:04.657 --> 32:06.390
Taking marv hebner's life
for your cause.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.092
Tony:
Oh, yeah, we found a
copy of the cityline

32:09.094 --> 32:10.394
Blueprint on board.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.229
Boo-ya!

32:12.231 --> 32:14.031
Is that right?
Yeah.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.366
I didn't steal the designs
to bomb the platform.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.434
I was going to board it.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.635
Next month.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.071
An onboard protest
against offshore drilling,

32:21.073 --> 32:23.173
Where cityline wouldn't
be able to ignore us.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.410
That explosion caused
irreparable damage

32:26.412 --> 32:28.211
To the ocean's ecosystems.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.080
I have no problem
going to prison

32:30.082 --> 32:31.415
For what I believe in,

32:31.417 --> 32:35.686
But that is against
everything I stand for.

32:43.394 --> 32:45.429
Gabs! Gabs! Gabs!
Gabs! Gabs! Gabs!

32:45.431 --> 32:46.596
Gabs... Gabs.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.598
It just... Saves time.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.467
You know, just...
Just go with it.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.703
Um, I found something fishy
on our evidence.

32:52.705 --> 32:54.604
Like, really fishy.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.640
<i>Acipenser oxyrinchus.</i>

32:56.642 --> 32:58.408
Otherwise known as...

32:58.410 --> 33:00.544
The north atlantic sturgeon.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.212
Found where?

33:02.214 --> 33:03.413
Melted on the detonator

33:03.415 --> 33:05.082
And other debris
from the bridge.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.485
This fish sample was altered
with acrylic resin,

33:08.487 --> 33:10.754
Potassium chromium sulfate,
formaldehyde...

33:10.756 --> 33:13.056
Abbs... English.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.058
Fish leather.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.361
Like from a work boot?

33:17.363 --> 33:19.096
No. Uh, sturgeon leather

33:19.098 --> 33:21.498
Is very rare
and extremely expensive.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.101
So it would be a more
high-quality good.

33:24.103 --> 33:25.736
Can you narrow
it down for us?

33:25.738 --> 33:27.371
I can, thanks to a metal shard

33:27.373 --> 33:29.373
That ducky pulled
from hebner's body.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.208
This wasn't
just shrapnel.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.343
It's a piece of an alloy
tumbler locking mechanism.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.445
Separately, the lock
and the leather

33:35.447 --> 33:37.247
Didn't make any sense,

33:37.249 --> 33:39.449
But when you put them together,
you get this.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.186
The merion attaché.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.688
That is where
the bomb was stored.

33:44.690 --> 33:48.425
A briefcase-- innocuous enough
to hide in plain sight.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.459
That's good work, abbs.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.428
She's not done yet.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.796
He knows me so well.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.732
I cross-referenced
the purchase logs

33:55.734 --> 33:58.068
For the merion attaché

33:58.070 --> 33:59.603
With all of the employees
from cityline,

33:59.605 --> 34:01.138
And I got a match.

34:01.140 --> 34:05.175
Brett creevy,
legal department.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.444
(cell phone buttons beeping)

34:07.446 --> 34:09.813
Is he checking
his e-mail?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.548
Oh, he's a smug
son of a bitch,

34:11.550 --> 34:12.616
Isn't he?
Lawyer.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.284
(door opens)
tony:
Boss.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.054
Planting a bomb was
just one of creevy's

34:17.056 --> 34:18.155
Many bad decisions.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.556
He lost his life savings

34:19.558 --> 34:21.825
In the broad street development
ponzi scheme last year.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.493
Didn't have much
to his name

34:23.495 --> 34:25.095
Until the explosion.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.430
Turns out creevy
short-sold shares

34:26.432 --> 34:27.697
Of cityline's stock last week.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.299
Mcgee:
Once news of the
explosion broke,

34:29.301 --> 34:30.567
Their stocks took a nosedive.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.069
(whistles)
just like bp's did

34:32.071 --> 34:33.770
After their incident
in the gulf.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.172
<i>Wall street.</i>

34:35.174 --> 34:36.506
"greed is good."

34:36.508 --> 34:37.774
The gekko.

34:37.776 --> 34:38.775
(tony chuckles)

34:38.777 --> 34:40.310
Love that movie.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.245
Creevy made a boatload
of cash, boss.

34:42.247 --> 34:43.246
Define "boatload."

34:43.248 --> 34:46.550
I tracked his funds to
an offshore account,

34:46.552 --> 34:48.452
Where I found a charge
for a chartered flight

34:48.454 --> 34:50.253
To the maldives,
departing tonight.

34:52.457 --> 34:54.758
(cell phone buttons beeping)

34:58.162 --> 34:59.663
All yours, borin.

35:01.866 --> 35:05.235
With pleasure.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.304
Good luck.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.243
You sure that's a
good idea, boss?

35:13.245 --> 35:16.346
She went a little
dirty harry in there.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.116
Of course, agent borin
is a professional,

35:19.118 --> 35:20.484
And I trust her
completely.

35:30.228 --> 35:31.561
I have been
sitting here

35:31.563 --> 35:33.263
For almost an hour,
agent borin.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.631
You have cityline's
full cooperation,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.633
But I have a schedule
to keep to.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.602
I understand.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.538
I'm sure you're anxious to
get home, pack for your trip.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.206
Trip?
What are you talking about?

35:43.208 --> 35:45.242
You bought a one-way
ticket to the maldives.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.277
You know, that's
a really nice choice.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.579
It's got gorgeous
white-sand beaches,

35:49.581 --> 35:51.348
Palm trees

35:51.350 --> 35:54.251
And no extradition.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.188
And I know one piece of luggage
you won't be taking with you.

35:59.524 --> 36:01.525
You know what's
interesting about this?

36:01.527 --> 36:04.161
I've got witnesses
who recall

36:04.163 --> 36:06.663
You on board the platform
the morning of the explosion

36:06.665 --> 36:08.398
Carrying that briefcase.

36:08.400 --> 36:12.602
But no one seems to remember
you leaving with it.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.404
Not even perry davidson,

36:14.406 --> 36:16.740
Who spent the entire day
with you.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.409
Hmm.

36:19.411 --> 36:20.944
Maybe now
is the time to mention

36:20.946 --> 36:22.679
That I have
a team of agents

36:22.681 --> 36:24.881
Searching your house
as we speak. Oh, yeah.

36:26.450 --> 36:29.419
They found the bomb-making
materials in your garage.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.587
Mmm.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.856
So...

36:32.858 --> 36:35.559
If a first-class ticket
to death row

36:35.561 --> 36:38.562
Doesn't appeal to you,
mr. Creevy,

36:38.564 --> 36:41.765
I suggest you start talking.

36:46.804 --> 36:49.272
It's not how I planned it.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.676
I didn't know hebner
was going to be on the bridge

36:52.678 --> 36:55.545
During the drill.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.980
I just wanted
the money.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.782
No one was
supposed to get hurt.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.784
I... I swear.

37:03.354 --> 37:04.955
Tony:
So, that's it?
He cracked already?

37:04.957 --> 37:06.389
Full confession, ten minutes.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.891
Don't get excited.
My record's five.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.960
Dr. Mallard,
what do you have there?

37:09.962 --> 37:12.996
This, my dear, is the
infernal contraption

37:12.998 --> 37:16.266
That's been driving me mad
these last two days.

37:16.268 --> 37:18.835
The thinkgeek annoy-a-tron?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.637
Yeah. Annoying
is an understatement.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.639
I've heard of
these things.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.708
They send out high-frequency
sounds intermittently.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.377
Yeah, making it
impossible to find.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.446
The intention, I suspect.

37:29.448 --> 37:33.316
I finally
found it tucked

37:33.318 --> 37:35.352
Into my desk lamp.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.987
Remember, anthony,

37:36.989 --> 37:39.889
Revenge is all the more sweet.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.958
(laughing):
What...?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.893
Why does everyone
assume it's me?

37:43.895 --> 37:45.028
Because nothing's
happened to you.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.630
And because
you're you.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.498
(snorting chuckle)
borin...

37:48.500 --> 37:49.633
Come on.

37:49.635 --> 37:51.501
You know I'm innocent.
Back me up here.

37:53.304 --> 37:55.905
Huh. I see.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.841
Well, I've been framed,

37:57.843 --> 37:59.976
And I'm going to get
to the bottom of this.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.678
Wait and see.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.416
(groaning)

38:11.389 --> 38:14.291
Borin:
You're already
at the bottom, dinozzo.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.860
(device beeps)

38:18.529 --> 38:19.996
(door creaks open)

38:19.998 --> 38:21.631
(blows)

38:23.934 --> 38:25.635
Your secret's
safe with me.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.637
Weighed-down
gear pack?

38:27.639 --> 38:29.739
It's the oldest
marine prank there is.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.411
No idea what
you're talking about.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.545
Right.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.713
Hey.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.548
I want to ask you something.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.016
Mm-hmm.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.685
When you left the corps,

38:41.687 --> 38:43.853
Was cgis the change
you were looking for?

38:47.325 --> 38:48.992
Not exactly.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.660
At least not at first.

38:52.963 --> 38:56.333
More like running away
than a fresh start.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.971
But eventually,
it became more.

39:01.973 --> 39:05.108
And the work started
to mean something.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.510
Started to feel...

39:07.512 --> 39:10.013
A sense of purpose again?

39:14.985 --> 39:17.420
You're good.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.425
Tell me how the story ends,
I'll be really impressed.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.795
Well, that kind of
depends on you, borin.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.697
How's that?

39:29.100 --> 39:31.668
You ever think about
making another change?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.443
It's a tempting thought.

39:40.445 --> 39:43.079
But I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't considered it.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.148
But I don't think

39:45.150 --> 39:47.450
I'm finished with
cgis just yet.

39:47.452 --> 39:48.985
Yeah, it's still a good fit.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.887
Besides, I got a
whole lot of lessons

39:50.889 --> 39:53.022
To teach omagi before
I let him take over.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.524
(chuckles)

39:54.526 --> 39:56.526
Can't argue with that.

39:56.528 --> 39:59.062
(cell phone ringing)

39:59.064 --> 40:00.497
Borin.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.099
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.404
Well, it's about that time.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.672
Thank you for the drink.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.947
Say I wanted to make a change
in the near future.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.817
I'm not going anywhere.

40:23.554 --> 40:24.988
Semper fi, gibbs.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.595
Semper paratus...

40:35.933 --> 40:37.467
Borin.
