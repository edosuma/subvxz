00:22.606 --> 00:25.692
I'm here with James
Maxwell in his solo show.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.946
Are you pleased with tonight?
Satisfied with your final product?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.782
I would hope so, I'm standing in
a room filled with it, right?

00:31.990 --> 00:34.576
Do you feel like this
is your best work,

00:34.785 --> 00:36.995
or do you feel like your best
work is still yet to come?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.039
Why don't you ask me
that in ten years?

00:39.248 --> 00:43.293
Okay, sorry, can you
excuse me for a second?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.504
I wasn't finished
with the interview.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.635
James, I want you to
meet Arthur Chang.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.929
- He's from Vogue.
- How you doing?

00:54.137 --> 00:57.099
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.851
Thank you, man, thank you.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.812
- Hi.
- You like this one?

01:02.020 --> 01:04.313
- I do. I do.
- I might know the artist.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.066
And I might be able
to get you a deal.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.609
- A deal?
- Yeah.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.486
Just my opinion, my
professional opinion,

01:09.695 --> 01:11.613
maybe don't give out
deals, and the artist

01:11.780 --> 01:13.591
doesn't have to sleep on
his buddy's couch anymore.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.033
Maybe he sleeps on
his buddy's couch

01:15.242 --> 01:17.345
- 'cause he likes his kids.
- You can have one of the kids.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.180
You can buy one of the kids
when you make some money.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.884
- I am blown away.
- Everything's for sale.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.709
This is amazing. All of it.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.504
Just know that I'm available to
be muse in any way possible.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.827
- Did you hear that? She said

01:28.839 --> 01:29.965
any way possible. - I did.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.175
I know. No, it's absolutely fine

01:32.384 --> 01:34.264
because I've always wanted
to fuck Barbara Bush.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.681
Is she here tonight? Come here.
All kidding aside, okay?

01:37.889 --> 01:40.142
- What?
- You are beyond talented.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.287
You deserve all this, and
we are very proud of you.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.521
- So proud. We love you.
- And I love you.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.982
Oh, my God! I'm at
the right place!

01:47.190 --> 01:51.153
Ah! Oh, honey. Gosh,
they look great.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.489
- Oh, hi, you, hi.
- What do you think?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.458
Maybe no more monthly
trips to Western Union.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.036
You know, I've made some
trips down to Western Union

01:59.244 --> 02:01.622
for you too, sir, Mr.
Rockefeller.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.790
Who are you? Loosen up.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.168
You look like
you're suffocating.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.376
Untuck. Untuck.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.714
Hi.

02:10.922 --> 02:11.965
Come here.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.425
- Maybe not.
- Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.678
Hi. Welcome. Can I steal
the man of the hour?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.972
Oh, did you hear that?
The man of the hour.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.391
You are the man of the hour.
And your hour is almost up.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.895
So please do your schmooze
thing with these weird people,

02:25.103 --> 02:26.543
and we will meet you
over at Bobby's.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.647
First drink's on you.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.281
I gotta be up at
5:30 in the morning.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.491
Where is this guy?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.052
Relax, he'll be
here in a second.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.744
He just needed some
time to himself.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.080
Some time to himself?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.998
Is this the right place?

02:47.084 --> 02:48.377
My boy!

02:48.543 --> 02:50.462
Hey, Bobby, whatever
he wants on me.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.589
A beer, please,
Bobby, my friend.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.759
- He'll have a beer.
- Okay, Vincent, man.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.345
- So? Verdict, verdict.
- Come on!

02:58.553 --> 03:02.432
I sold every painting.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.810
Oh, I'm not surprised a bit.
Not a bit.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.646
- L'm a little prejudiced.
- I want to make a toast.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.398
I can't believe it.
Your first show?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.167
You sell everything. I
want to say something.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.693
Zip it. Don't say anything.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.403
Bobby, no more
drinks for this one.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.238
- You do it. Go.
- Oh, can I?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.031
- Yeah, please.
- Thank you very much.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.093
Now that I'm allowed to
speak, to my best friend

03:20.117 --> 03:22.035
in the whole world, I
love you very m...

03:22.244 --> 03:24.124
- To the next... who's a big artist?
- Basquiat.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.331
That's a lot of pressure.
That's a lot of pressure.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.669
Hey, the world is your oyster,
babe, I love you very much.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.004
- Salud!
- Hey, James Maxwell, huh?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.799
- Everybody, James Maxwell!
- Cheers!

03:36.007 --> 03:40.345
James!

03:40.554 --> 03:42.431
James!

03:42.639 --> 03:46.143
What? What?

03:46.351 --> 03:50.939
- Get in here!
- I'm still drunk.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.067
We're being attacked.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.819
What, what are you
talking about?

04:00.157 --> 04:03.160
What are you talking about? Hmm?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.829
- Come look at this.
- What are you going on about?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.961
This is a movie?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.338
No, this is happening.
Lt's on every channel.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.175
What?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.177
Oh, my God, all those people.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.763
Oh, my God, no.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.473
No.

04:24.681 --> 04:29.144
- <i>'</i> No!

04:29.352 --> 04:31.188
They might not have
made it to work, right?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.982
Pick up the phone.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.362
Pick up the fucking phone! Fuck.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.161
Fuck.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.414
L'm going down there, okay?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.919
Due to an emergency situation,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.630
we are unable to take
your call at this <i>time.</i>

04:56.838 --> 04:58.673
<i>Please try your call later.</i>

05:11.269 --> 05:13.230
First let me start
by telling you

05:13.438 --> 05:15.690
lam so sorry for your loss.

05:15.899 --> 05:20.779
So, Mr. Maxwell, it says
here that Elizabeth

05:20.987 --> 05:23.949
and Alexander Clark in
the event of their death

05:24.157 --> 05:27.244
bequeath guardianship of
both of their children,

05:27.452 --> 05:29.955
Alexis and Grace Clark

05:30.163 --> 05:33.959
to... you.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.253
- To James?
- What?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.046
There has to be some
sort of mistake.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.631
L'm afraid there isn't. lt's...

05:39.840 --> 05:41.591
Why would they not
have told me that?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.345
To be honest, Mr.
Maxwell, younger parents,

05:45.554 --> 05:49.099
parents in general would never
imagine this happening,

05:49.307 --> 05:51.101
certainly not like this.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.396
Okay, so, I mean, what...

05:54.604 --> 05:57.858
What are... what
are the options?

05:58.066 --> 06:01.278
Well, should you choose not
to accept guardianship,

06:01.486 --> 06:05.031
the children would be
put in foster care.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.075
Together?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.744
- In foster care together?
- Lt's highly unlikely.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.516
This is so beautiful.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.917
Gracie, oh! Gracie! You
were so wonderful.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.294
Teach, I can't believe you came.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.142
L just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.423
- Thought I'd stop by.
- Stop it!

07:03.632 --> 07:04.925
L'm so proud of you.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.053
I wouldn't have missed
this for anything.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.472
What about you? Did you like it?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.349
It was all right.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.517
- Just all right?
- It was okay.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.687
It was... ow, ow, ow!
Okay, okay, okay.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.096
Are you kidding? It was great.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.358
It was more than great.
It was beautiful.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.609
L'm so proud of you.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.070
Hi, that was just... wow.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.198
That... that... that
was just fantastic.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.741
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.630
You have a very talented
little girl there.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.411
Thank you.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.288
Giovanni Sacco,
Hoffman Music Center.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.457
James Maxwell. Nice to meet you.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.710
Our special music high school
just opened last fall.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.796
L'm just... l'm curious.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.549
What does a tuition cost a year

07:46.758 --> 07:49.094
at the Hoffman special
music high school?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.389
- Around 36.
- Thousand.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.392
And another 13 and a
change for room and board

07:55.558 --> 07:58.061
if she decides to live on
campus, which is recommended.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.331
- Sure, of course, course.
- The most important thing

08:00.355 --> 08:03.817
is getting her in, and for that,
I'm almost certain we can do.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.403
On a scholarship or...

08:06.611 --> 08:08.488
Um, possibly a scholarship.

08:08.697 --> 08:14.119
Though with only 50 slots
available for each grade,

08:14.327 --> 08:17.163
full ride is about as likely
as winning the lottery,

08:17.372 --> 08:20.458
but possibly a scholarship.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.128
Listen, lt's up to Grace. This
is ultimately her decision.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.214
- Of course. - ls there
a way I can reach you?

08:26.423 --> 08:29.926
- Did you have a card?
- Oh, I do. I do.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.721
Listen, let's not...
let's not wait on this.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.056
The sooner we move...

08:35.265 --> 08:37.808
- <i>l'll</i> be in touch. Okay.
- Okay.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.602
Are you sure that's something
you're interested in?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.274
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.168
I need to make sure because
I wouldn't force you

08:46.192 --> 08:48.111
to do something you
don't want to do.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.919
- You understand right?
- I know. I know.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.450
All right. Okay. You
gotta do what you love.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.452
- You gotta love it.
- I know. I know.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.537
All right. All right, okay.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.122
- Dad.
- Yeah?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.999
You know in First Blood

09:01.207 --> 09:03.001
when Stallone is on the mountain

09:03.209 --> 09:05.128
and the bad guys are
shooting at him,

09:05.336 --> 09:07.672
and he falls into the
freezing-cold water?

09:07.881 --> 09:11.134
And then he's like
so, so, so cold.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.553
Like, he's gonna
freeze to death.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.848
So he makes a fire, takes
off all his wet clothes...

09:17.057 --> 09:18.933
Whoa, I'm a little scared
where this is going.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.203
Where is this going with him
taking off his clothes?

09:21.227 --> 09:25.190
Stallone sits in front
of the fire to keep warm

09:25.398 --> 09:27.150
so he won't die.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.195
The fire, it keeps him alive.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.863
Okay, what is
happening right now?

09:32.072 --> 09:36.242
Dad, music is my fire.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.995
What? Who are you?

09:39.204 --> 09:40.484
What did you do
with my daughter?

09:40.622 --> 09:41.873
Stop!

09:42.082 --> 09:45.043
- Ow.
- Sorry. Okay, race your home.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.878
All right, you ready? One...

09:47.087 --> 09:50.131
On your mark, get set, go!
Hey, no, no, no, stop!

09:57.639 --> 10:00.266
Dad, can I go scare Alexis?

10:00.475 --> 10:01.952
Not tonight. I need
to talk to her first.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.229
- Okay? Go get ready for bed.
- Fine.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.525
Go turn on the television.
I'll be right there, okay?

10:08.733 --> 10:11.444
Okay. Sure.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.325
Hey. What happened?
Where were you?

10:17.534 --> 10:20.787
I don't feel well.
That's why I'm in bed.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.123
I can tell you're sick
by your attitude.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.042
Well, go to sleep then, okay?

10:26.251 --> 10:29.212
That's the plan if
you'd just leave.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.881
You're a piece of
work, you know that?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.509
- Sweet dreams.
- All right.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.678
If you're not feeling
well in the morning,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.680
I'm gonna call you a doctor.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.246
Damn, girl, what
took you so long?

11:03.454 --> 11:04.747
They just got back.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.433
I had to wait for
them to check on me.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.097
Why is he all up in
your business so much?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.962
- Because he's fucking annoying.
- Hmm.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.177
Come on, we only have a
couple of hours, let's go.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.054
- You sure you're ready for this?
- Oh!

11:20.263 --> 11:23.850
As soon as conflict arises,

11:24.058 --> 11:26.769
they mutually calm one another.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.106
<i>And some will even provoke...</i>

11:30.315 --> 11:32.108
<i>just so they can get
a bit of comfort.</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:35.403
And that's the total?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.575
That's the total...
that's before I pay

11:40.783 --> 11:42.911
the mortgage for next month?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.663
All right, well, I guess give...

11:45.872 --> 11:47.415
give the realtor my number.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.644
Well done. Your best
work in 10 years.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.110
I'm barely paying my
mortgage as it is.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.446
I am so sorry, sweetie.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.115
Art programs are always
the first to go.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.910
They're also reducing
music positions,

12:24.118 --> 12:26.663
foreign language positions
and eliminating

12:26.871 --> 12:30.208
all the after-school art
programs altogether.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.210
God damn bastards and
their budget cuts.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.837
James, I'm so sorry.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.258
These kind of cuts are
absolutely infuriating.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.594
It boils my blood to think that
they're actually happening.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.389
I need a cigarette.
Really, I'm so sorry.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.641
Fuck this, I'm losing James.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.102
I don't know if
this is something

12:49.310 --> 12:52.021
you would even consider,
but seeing since

12:52.230 --> 12:54.041
you are from Buffalo, I
figured I'd bring it up.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.775
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.194
Let me finish before
you huff and puff.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.904
Go ahead.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.532
An old colleague of mine is on
the board at Buffalo State.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.451
We spoke the other day, and
she mentioned a position

13:05.660 --> 13:08.579
in their art program that
may become available,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.331
like, next semester.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.710
What kind of position,
teaching position?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.504
Well, no, you'd be
cleaning the brushes.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.257
- Okay.
- Yes, you would be teaching art

13:19.465 --> 13:21.926
to university students,
nonetheless.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.761
So if you would like,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.347
I could put in a
word on your behalf.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.058
I mean, Christ, I
couldn't wait to get out

13:29.225 --> 13:30.985
of that place fast enough
when I was younger.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.855
Right about now, I'd say
beggars can't be choosers.

13:36.816 --> 13:40.528
What do I got to lose?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.506
- Gas chromatograph!
- Two words: micro-brewery.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.866
I love having a bank
on every corner.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.995
- I'll see you in court.
- It is the original absinthe recipe.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.874
So, uh... what do you do?

13:53.082 --> 13:56.419
Well, as of today,
I'm unemployed.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.422
Oh. Shit.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.799
L'm sorry to hear that.
That sucks.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.093
It does suck, yeah.

14:04.260 --> 14:08.556
Well, what... um...
what did you do?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.641
As in why did I get fired?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.812
No, what was your job?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.899
My job was teaching art.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.275
What university?

14:19.484 --> 14:21.569
The University of PSU 34.

14:21.778 --> 14:26.783
Oh. Right. So you
taught little kids.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.660
Made like collages and shit?
That's cute.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.662
Yeah, collages and shit.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.791
It keeps them from
pissing themselves.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.836
What is his problem? Ls
he always an asshole?

14:39.045 --> 14:42.632
He's actually a really
brilliant painter.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.260
Really? What style do you paint?

14:46.469 --> 14:51.057
He's a, um... an abstract...
abstract impressionist.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.683
Expressionist, but that's fine.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.811
When was your last show?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.938
My last show was September 10th.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.566
This Sept... of this year?
I didn't hear about it.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.694
2001. I'm sure you were
at a Hamptons function

15:03.903 --> 15:05.780
snorting cocaine or on a yacht.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.990
Okay, you know what? I
think you've had enough.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.742
Yeah, not nearly.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.720
You think you can maybe
stop being such a jerk

15:11.744 --> 15:13.329
and just not embarrass me?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.790
No, Amy, it's okay,
don't worry about it.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.000
It's no problem. Actually, I...

15:18.209 --> 15:21.546
I think I was on a yacht
snorting cocaine in 2001.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.922
See? What he said!

15:25.258 --> 15:28.636
- I should go, actually.
- What are you talking about? Just stop.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.431
L've got two children that my
life revolves around at home.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.742
Remember? One's about this tall.
The other's this tall.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.144
Jesus, James, come on,
Alexis is babysitting.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.230
- It's fine.
- That's exactly why I need to get home.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.482
- Excuse me.
- James.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.735
James! James!

15:50.533 --> 15:52.160
James! What are you doing?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.954
What does it look
like I'm doing?

15:55.163 --> 15:56.789
L'm going home. Go
back to your party.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.125
- Go be a social butterfly.
- Don't do this.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.961
Do what? I'm going home.
I'll see you later.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.981
No, the whole point in
being in a relationship

16:04.005 --> 16:06.632
is that we actually
do things together.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.509
Otherwise, what's the point?

16:08.718 --> 16:11.012
We do do things together.
What are you talking about?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.890
Look, lounging on your couch
with carryout watching a movie

16:14.098 --> 16:16.767
once your kids go to sleep
has kind of lost its luster.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.812
Look, I'm bored!

16:20.021 --> 16:21.898
L'm sorry I bore you.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.941
I just want to have fun,

16:24.150 --> 16:27.278
and I don't really want
to play house anymore.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.907
Okay, here it comes.
Go ahead, go ahead.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.408
I can't do this anymore.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.369
I tried. I really did.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.681
L'm just not in a place for
that kind of commitment.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.750
Really, after the day I had,
you're gonna do this to me?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.376
I really am sorry.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.504
I'm sorry.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.640
Okay.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.968
I have to talk to you girls
about something important.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.936
Yeah, did you get dumped again?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.271
What? No. Who told you that?

17:02.480 --> 17:07.151
So you're saying that you and
Amy are still together then.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.819
If you must know, we decided
to part ways amicably.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.614
- Mm.
- What's "amicably"?

17:11.821 --> 17:13.616
It means we broke
up on good terms.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.202
- It means she dumped him.
- Oh, stop it, Alexis.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.494
It's not nice!

17:19.204 --> 17:21.374
Are you okay, Daddy?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.667
L'm fine, sweetheart, I'm fine.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.877
Sometimes relationships
just don't work out.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.964
Or in your case,
they never work out.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.591
- Oh, shut up, stupid!
- Alexis...

17:30.800 --> 17:32.903
- She's the one that hit me.
- Put a cork in it, okay?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.720
Nobody wants to
hear your comments.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.098
- Yeah, put a cork in it.
- Grace, Grace, Grace!

17:37.306 --> 17:41.978
You, too. Now, listen. I
have to go to Buffalo today.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.026
- Can I come with you?
- You can't, sweetheart, you have school.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.899
- That's not fair!
- Lt's a quick one.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.069
I'll back this evening, and
don't you get any ideas.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.530
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you gonna go see Ginny?

17:52.738 --> 17:54.865
- Or Uncle Lou?!
- That, too, yes.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.076
But no, I'm going to interview

17:57.285 --> 17:59.203
for a teaching position
at the university there,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.056
and that's what I was trying
to talk you girls about.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.957
If you think I'm
moving to Buffalo,

18:03.165 --> 18:05.626
- you're out of your mind.
- Lt's not just up to you, okay?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.771
If I get a job there,
that's what we're gonna do.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.606
L'm not going, I don't
care what you have to say.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.132
- L'm excited.
- Shut up!

18:11.340 --> 18:14.176
Alexis! We can't afford
to live here anymore.

18:14.385 --> 18:17.013
Lam tired of struggling. I'm
tired, do you understand?

18:17.221 --> 18:20.349
- I can't do it.
- I don't care. I'm not going.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.560
I'll stay in the
apartment by myself.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.854
That's not an option, okay?
Because...

18:25.062 --> 18:27.648
I have to put the
apartment on the market.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.734
Oh, fuck you! Lt's
not yours to sell.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.861
Please don't talk to me that way.
I am trying.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.509
You think I want to
move to Buffalo?!

18:33.613 --> 18:35.031
Do you? You think I wanna do it?

18:35.239 --> 18:39.327
It's our house, not yours.
They left it to us.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.168
Hey, don't worry, Dad.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.337
I can get a job at a
piano bar or something

18:49.503 --> 18:51.047
to make some extra scratch.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.176
Who are you?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.763
L'm the cure, and
you're the disease.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.598
What is that, Terminator?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.850
No. Cobra.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.852
Wow.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.572
Hey, buddy.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.617
Good times.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.786
- What's wrong?
- Looks like I'm moving back.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.913
Don't sound too
excited about it.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.082
It's not just me I
have to worry about.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.793
Jimmy, you're talking
about kids, babe, okay?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.337
Kids are... kids are like
night animals, okay?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.089
They just adjust.
They'll be fine.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.217
You haven't spent enough
time with Alexis lately.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.593
Wait a minute, this ain't
a democracy, cuz, okay?

19:37.802 --> 19:40.429
What you say goes,
period, end of story.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.223
Says the guy who has no kids.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.392
Yeah, says me. Let me
tell you another thing.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.852
Parents nowadays, they give
their kids too much freedom

19:47.061 --> 19:49.188
to speak those little
fucking minds, all right?

19:49.397 --> 19:50.940
Was it like that when
we were kids? No.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.418
No, it wasn't, but your father
whooped your ass every day.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.611
Are you suggesting that
I smack Alexis around?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.489
Yeah, I think you should beat
the shit out of your daughter.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.698
No, you jerkoff, but you
still gotta be firm, okay?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.785
With an iron fist, velvet glove.

20:02.952 --> 20:05.121
Okay, can we not
talk about this?

20:05.329 --> 20:08.141
- L'm stressed enough as it is.
- Let me tell you one more thing, okay?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.584
That piece of shit shaped me
into the person I am today.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.838
So like him or not... which
I motherfucking don't,

20:14.046 --> 20:15.756
okay, he taught me respect.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.401
You know what? You
missed your calling.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.218
You should've been a
child psychologist.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.930
Well, compliments of
Uncle Lou for Gracie.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.459
- You're welcome.
- What the hell?

20:26.642 --> 20:30.187
<i>Copland? Fucking Copland?
- Yeah, so what'?</i>

20:30.396 --> 20:31.772
So what? She's 12 years old?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.875
Oh, please, Jimmy, we
didn't watch those movies

20:33.899 --> 20:36.152
- when we were kids?
- And look how you turned out.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.320
Oh, my God, what,
are you hungry?

20:38.529 --> 20:40.489
Marron! vYou always whine
when you're hungry

20:40.698 --> 20:42.283
ever since you were a kid!

20:42.491 --> 20:44.010
We'll go get you something
to eat, how's that sound?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.554
I have to get to the airport.
Let's go.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.711
<i>What are you doing? Stop!</i>

20:53.919 --> 20:56.464
- Hi.
- Dad, how was it?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.299
Did you see Uncle Lou?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.843
I did. I did.

21:01.051 --> 21:05.848
Did he, maybe, I don't know,
leave something for me?

21:06.056 --> 21:08.267
Yes, he did, Grace, but
what did I tell you

21:08.476 --> 21:09.786
about watching those
kinds of movies?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.562
I don't want you...
What are you doing?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.190
Why not? Lt's just research.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.858
Research for what, honey?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.706
You're not old enough,
end of story, okay?

21:17.860 --> 21:19.987
Way to throw a wrench
in the program!

21:20.196 --> 21:22.156
Okay, calm down.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.408
Where is your sister?

21:24.617 --> 21:27.369
Um...

21:27.578 --> 21:29.330
in her... room?

21:29.538 --> 21:31.707
Why is that a question?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.091
Hey, Alex... oh.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.927
Oh, my God!

21:43.135 --> 21:44.720
Get off.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.515
Oh, shit, oh, fuck.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.144
What the fuck is going on? Ls
this what you call studying?

21:52.353 --> 21:53.813
What the fuck is
going on in here?!

21:54.021 --> 21:55.373
It's not what it looks
like, I swear, man.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.875
Get your clothes on.
Get your clothes on.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.442
- Get the fuck out!
- Be quiet!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.194
- Cool out, homey.
- Homey?! Homey?!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.446
Excuse me, homey?! You
calling me homey, homey?!

22:02.655 --> 22:04.007
Get your clothes on
and get out of here!

22:04.031 --> 22:05.342
Get over here. Get
outta my house.

22:05.366 --> 22:06.909
You can't be grabbing
me like that!

22:07.117 --> 22:09.203
My shoes! You can't be
grabbing me like that!

22:09.411 --> 22:12.081
I can grab you any way I want!

22:12.289 --> 22:15.167
Want your shoes? Here. Don't
ever fucking come back.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.776
Open this door.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.046
- No, leave me alone!
- Open the goddamn door!

22:19.255 --> 22:20.441
- No, I hate you! - Yeah? Well,

22:20.453 --> 22:21.650
you're gonna hate me a lot more

22:21.674 --> 22:23.026
because we're moving to Buffalo!

22:23.050 --> 22:25.219
L'm not going! You
can't make me!

22:25.427 --> 22:27.555
Yes, I can, you
better believe it.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.182
Fuck you! I'll just
move in with Oscar!

22:30.391 --> 22:31.952
You will be lucky
if you ever see

22:31.976 --> 22:33.203
that little piece of shit again.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.687
Matter of fact, you are lucky

22:34.895 --> 22:36.730
if you see <i>anyone</i> again
until you're 18.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.400
I'm not going! You can't
tell me what to do!

22:39.608 --> 22:42.278
- You're not my father!
- I'm the closest thing you've got!

22:42.486 --> 22:44.989
Just go away forever!

22:45.197 --> 22:46.740
Honestly, I wish I could!

22:46.949 --> 22:49.149
But you and I are stuck together
until you're old enough

22:49.285 --> 22:50.369
to move out on your own!

22:55.624 --> 22:57.793
Hey. Hey-

22:58.002 --> 23:00.296
Oh. Sweetheart, I...

23:00.504 --> 23:02.631
we were just yelling
at each other, okay?

23:02.840 --> 23:04.680
We were angry. We don't
mean any of that, okay?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.261
L'm sorry you had to hear that.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.097
Dad, snap out of it, okay?

23:10.306 --> 23:13.017
The world ain't all
sunshine and rainbows.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.769
It's a very mean
and nasty place,

23:15.978 --> 23:17.338
and I don't care
how tough you are!

23:17.521 --> 23:19.315
It will beat you
down to your knees

23:19.523 --> 23:23.777
and keep you there
permanently if you let it.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.529
What the hell is that from?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.323
Rocky Balboa.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.408
Okay, okay, listen,

23:29.617 --> 23:32.202
we gotta limit the time you
spend with Uncle Lou okay?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.746
Let's go do kid things.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.956
Let's eat candy and
watch cartoons.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.083
- Candy gets in my teeth.
- That's fine.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.169
You can have bad
teeth for one night.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.675
Oh, wouldn't want to leave
Beethoven, would we?

23:46.884 --> 23:47.884
No.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.846
Why isn't everything packed up?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.806
I hate you.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.475
Good, pack that up, too.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.936
And that, too, wouldn't
wanna forget that.

Lexi, you've been coming
here for ten years, bade.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.460
Used to love this place, remember?
True or false.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.880
Yeah, you know, that's because
I always knew we got to leave.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.258
And now because of him,

25:09.466 --> 25:12.553
we get to live in the country
like a bunch of redneck farmers.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.555
All we're missing are
the fucking chickens.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.516
Yeah, but we ain't got chickens.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.486
Oh, yeah, yeah, I really like
what you've done with the place.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.947
Yeah? Good, 'cause that's
how it's gonna stay.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.991
You know you have
closets, right?

25:34.199 --> 25:35.784
And you know you're
annoying, right?

25:35.993 --> 25:37.536
Will you please just
unpack the boxes?

25:37.745 --> 25:39.681
Put your clothes away. We've
been here for a week.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.957
- It's a mess.
- Lt's my room. lt's my mess.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.585
Everything's exactly where
it should be, in boxes.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.393
Whatever, just keep
the door closed then.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.088
It was closed.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.682
One out of two ain't bad.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.362
Could be a little tighter.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.948
OMG! lt's my first time
playing this arrangement.

26:15.157 --> 26:16.909
L'm just saying it
sounds a little loose.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.911
Honestly, Dad, put a cork in it.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.162
Lam

26:28.170 --> 26:29.880
- Cut it out!
- Shut up.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.840
- Give it back!
- No!

26:32.049 --> 26:33.693
- Lt's mine!
- Lt's mine.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.345
Dad! Alexis, stop!

26:38.722 --> 26:41.266
You call this a tomato
or a "tomahto"?

26:41.475 --> 26:43.310
- "Tomahto"?
- Lt's a tomato.

26:43.519 --> 26:44.829
But you know what?
You're a good kid.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.523
I knew that. What's in there?

26:47.731 --> 26:51.401
You know what that means?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.296
- No.
- That means when you spit in the sky,

26:53.320 --> 26:55.240
it winds up in your face,
so what I'm telling you

26:55.405 --> 26:56.865
is you don't ask me my business.

26:57.074 --> 26:59.660
Are you kidding me? I never
give my secrets away.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.870
Never, but when you get
a little older, kid,

27:02.079 --> 27:03.807
<i>l'll</i> tell you some stuff,
but don't tell Lou.

27:03.831 --> 27:07.167
Don't tell anybody, all right?
Now give that a shake.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.003
Shake it up. Give it a shake.
There you go.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.689
All right, you wanna
drizzle it on there.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.566
Just drizzle it, stick
your pinky out like that.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.175
The drizzle becomes
drazzle like that.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.344
And that's where the love is.
Go ahead, put it on.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.917
- There you go. - What is taking

27:18.929 --> 27:20.389
so long, for crying out loud?

27:20.597 --> 27:23.100
Ginny's about the pass out
over here from malnutrition.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.645
- Hi, Aunt Tiff.
- Hey, munchkin. Keep an eye on these two.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.522
They'll put too many
onions on the salad.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.483
- It's two small onions.
- Two small onions, get out of here.

27:31.692 --> 27:34.027
It's too many! It
gives me angina.

27:34.236 --> 27:37.072
- You know this, come on!
- Honest to God, marron.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.300
You break my balls. They're
like grapefruits, Tiff.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.243
Hurry it up, you know
you don't want us

27:41.451 --> 27:43.996
ordering takeout, do you,
for crying out loud.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.622
She had a box of
wine at the house.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.040
She'll be drunk by the salad.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.627
So, girls, how was your dinner?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.087
It was delicious.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.548
Alexis?

27:54.756 --> 27:56.466
Fine.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.052
Okay, hot plate coming through.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.429
Oh, what is this?

28:00.637 --> 28:03.640
Fresh cannolis,
mascarpone cheesecake

28:03.849 --> 28:05.535
hot out of the oven.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.978
You guys didn't make these.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.314
You're singing like
a bird over here.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.442
- What I tell you about secrets?
- I'm just kidding.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.278
- Thank you for dinner.
- Our pleasure, our pleasure.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.238
Uh, where you going?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.824
Going to meet with
Sarah's friends.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.912
Okay, fine. Be home
by 10:30, all right?

28:25.078 --> 28:26.997
10:30, are you kidding me?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.006
I got to stay out later
than that in New York.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.626
That was New York.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.628
Sarah gets to stay
out until 11:30.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.255
This is bullshit, Grace is gonna
be awake when I get home.

28:35.464 --> 28:39.218
Alexis... have a little
respect for your father.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.969
I would.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.096
But he's not here. He's dead.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.935
Still dying to
have one of those?

28:48.143 --> 28:51.355
No. Who wants cannolis?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.654
L'm super psyched
you're here, though.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.656
We're gonna have so
much fun together.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.658
L'm not staying long, right?

29:02.866 --> 29:04.159
Why not?

29:04.368 --> 29:05.648
L'm moving in with my boyfriend.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.038
Wait, really? He
has his own place?

29:08.247 --> 29:11.083
I mean, basically, like,
it's his parents' place,

29:11.291 --> 29:13.585
but they are never there,
they're always traveling.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.671
What does he look like?
Do you have a picture?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.422
Is he cute? Ls he tall?

29:19.383 --> 29:22.135
OMG, he's so cute.

29:22.344 --> 29:25.055
I'd give anything to be like you

29:25.264 --> 29:27.474
and get out of this
lame-ass town.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.560
Hey, you guys want another beer?

29:32.521 --> 29:34.481
I have one.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.608
L'm gonna go pee, okay?

29:41.655 --> 29:42.864
You want one?

29:43.073 --> 29:44.116
Sure.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.705
L'm Christian.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.164
Alexis.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.335
You want a drag?

29:55.544 --> 29:58.088
No, I don't... I don't smoke.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.215
I don't really drink either.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.592
What's with the beer then?

30:02.801 --> 30:05.929
Well, it's easier to pretend
you do then say you don't.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.560
Fuck, I'm sorry.

30:11.768 --> 30:14.771
I know it's, like, super
early, but I have to go.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.275
Oh, come on, I have to go to.
I could walk you.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.861
Yeah? Okay, cool.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.750
I can't thank you
enough for the house,

30:34.958 --> 30:37.252
for just everything.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.672
L'm so glad I've got you here.
So glad.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.011
How's the transition going?

30:46.219 --> 30:49.473
Lt's strange. It is
strange, you know?

30:49.681 --> 30:53.894
L'm not... l'm still not
used to the no sirens

30:54.102 --> 30:56.563
and no garbage trucks
at night, you know?

30:56.772 --> 30:58.440
I would think that
would be a blessing.

30:58.607 --> 30:59.941
You would think.
You would think.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.860
But, uh, you know,

31:02.069 --> 31:05.155
the silence just forces
me to be in my own head.

31:05.364 --> 31:08.325
And I don't want to be there.
I want to be present.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.828
My head is a bad neighborhood.
Lt's a ghetto.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.665
It'll change.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.874
Oh, yeah?

31:19.544 --> 31:21.213
I hope so.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.632
Grace seems to be
adjusting very nicely.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.717
She's gonna love Robert.

31:25.926 --> 31:28.887
- I hope so.
- Oh, yeah, she will.

31:29.096 --> 31:31.890
He's an amazing teacher.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.268
And, uh... Alexis...

31:37.729 --> 31:41.024
How's she behaving,
generally speaking?

31:41.233 --> 31:45.153
Generally speaking, she's a
big fat fucking asshole.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.281
Like, just the worst
asshole ever.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.283
Generally speaking.

31:50.492 --> 31:53.412
Well... give it some time.

31:53.620 --> 31:56.373
Now wh d <i>Y</i> O you guys say that?

31:56.581 --> 31:58.083
Why do old people
say give it time?

31:58.291 --> 32:01.002
Fuck off! Old people say!

32:01.211 --> 32:03.171
L'm just saying you have
the least amount of time.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.923
It's just odd. Just
an observation.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.817

33:35.055 --> 33:36.365
You wish you had
hair I could ruin,

33:36.389 --> 33:39.434
you bald motherfucker, come on.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.440
- Holy shit.
- Oh.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.317
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.820
What are you... what
are you doing here?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.532
You know, just being forced
to work against my will.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.744
Yeah, me too. Well,
no not forced.

33:57.953 --> 34:02.666
More like persuaded if I ever
want to go away for college.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.503
Anyway, I'm really glad
you're working here.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.921
Okay.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.719
There's my girl!
Hey, Lexi, bear.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.638
Hi, Aunt Tiff.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.681
So you know what? I'm
gonna do you a favor.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.391
L'm gonna poach you
from this guy.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.726
You come work for me at
the salon, you know?

34:22.936 --> 34:25.230
Yeah, I think this is actually
gonna be fine, though.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.451
- Oh. - Hey, C, why don't you

34:29.463 --> 34:30.902
take Alexis in the back,

34:31.110 --> 34:32.987
bring her up to speed on
walking the beat, huh?

34:33.196 --> 34:36.699
- Yes, sir. - lt's not
NYPD Blue, you meathead.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.803
Wait, you're not gonna
introduce me to your friend?

34:38.827 --> 34:42.289
Christian, James.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.105
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- How you

34:44.117 --> 34:45.810
doing, Christ... ooh,
sir, I like this guy.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.710
- Okay, that's enough.
- Who is this guy?

34:47.918 --> 34:49.462
- Why are you blushing?
- Okay, bye.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.297
Why is she blushing? Okay, fine.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.592
L'll be back to pick
you up later, okay?

34:53.800 --> 34:54.967
Whatever.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.138
Oh, boy. Good luck.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.473
Yes, okay, yeah, no.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.018
I'll call you later this week.
Okay, bye.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.604
Do you make a habit of hovering
over women you don't know,

35:05.812 --> 35:08.189
or is it my lucky day?

35:08.398 --> 35:11.276
Oh, no, I... I wasn't lingering.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.320
L'm just... l'm
trying to find the...

35:13.528 --> 35:16.239
Spit it out.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.451
L'm new on campus.
I'm trying to f...

35:19.659 --> 35:22.162
- Are you a student?
- No, God, no.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.165
Whoa, is this school not good
enough for the likes of you?

35:25.373 --> 35:28.418
What? No, I... l just, um...

35:28.627 --> 35:30.337
You seem very nervous.
Are you all right?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.340
Because I tend to have
that effect on people.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.176
L'm fine, I'm just... l'm looking
for the administration building.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.846
Ah, I can see my...
my sense of humor

35:40.055 --> 35:42.891
has not traveled
across the pond.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.143
I just don't want to be
late on my first day.

35:45.352 --> 35:48.021
First day of what? Janitor?

35:48.229 --> 35:50.899
Is that what I look like?
Do I look like a janitor?

35:51.107 --> 35:53.026
No, I'm teaching
here next semester.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.696
Oh, well, we don't want you
to be late on your first day.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.074
L'm Bridget, by the way.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.825
James.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.661
I will show you where
you need to be.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.955
- That'd be very nice. Thanks.
- Sure, let's go.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.540
So are you a student?

36:07.749 --> 36:09.876
Oh. <i>I</i> wish.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.295
Thank you, but, no,
theater department.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.588
- Oh. Art department.
- No.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.173
- Yeah.
- No.

36:15.382 --> 36:16.742
- Yeah.
- No, they didn't tell you.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.009
What? Tell me what?

36:18.218 --> 36:19.886
Mrs. Morrison decided
not to retire.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.846
That position is no
longer available.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.866
- What?!
- I can't believe they didn't tell you.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.392
What are you talking about?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.811
L just moved my whole
life to this place!

36:28.019 --> 36:29.872
- What are you talking about...
- Calm down, calm down.

36:29.896 --> 36:34.109
- L'm fucking with you.
- That's not funny.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.735
- L'm sorry.
- No, that's not funny.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.237
I don't think you understand

36:37.445 --> 36:38.881
that you nearly gave
me a heart attack.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.424
We really need to work
on your sense of humor.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.283
You are very uptight.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.285
Maybe you need to
work on your jokes.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.496
See, now that, that's
what I'm talking about.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.123
- Yeah.
- Come on, we'll be late.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.624
Drama people.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.918
Five rules you must abide by.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.170
"When you're on the clock,
you're on the beat,

36:54.379 --> 36:55.564
and when you're on the beat,

36:55.588 --> 36:57.132
APB"?

36:57.298 --> 37:00.260
Awareness, performance, bravado.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.637
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

37:02.846 --> 37:06.141
And then the fifth one is
the most important one.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.017
So make sure you remember it.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.271
"Never, ever belittle, insult,

37:11.479 --> 37:13.398
or voice any
displeasure outwardly

37:13.606 --> 37:17.068
for the God of cinema himself,
Sir Sylvester Stallone."

37:17.277 --> 37:21.156
- You kidding me?
- Yo, Adrian, I did it!

37:23.575 --> 37:25.410
What? lt's... it's from Rocky.

37:25.618 --> 37:28.830
Yeah, I know, and
it was terrible.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.583
Well, you should see
my Adrian impression.

37:31.791 --> 37:32.791
It's even worse.

37:34.878 --> 37:39.174
You're really pretty
when you smile.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.967
I have a boyfriend.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.344
Y-yeah, no, I meant...

37:47.015 --> 37:49.851
So, tell me, how do you
like living here so far?

37:50.059 --> 37:51.978
I love it. Lt's like
a new adventure.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.773
Yeah, have you met
any new friends yet?

37:54.981 --> 37:58.651
Uh-huh, Uncle Lou, Denny, Dino,

37:58.860 --> 38:00.862
Aunt Tiff, and you, too.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.239
Aw, your sweet. I love
you too, darling.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.075
But I mean, you know,
friends your own age.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.244
Not really.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.915
Hmm, well, it's important to
have friends your own age.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.666
Well, I don't really get along

38:13.875 --> 38:16.211
with other kids
my age that well.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.588
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I understand.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.549
But, you know, you might
give it a shot because,

38:21.758 --> 38:24.385
who knows, you might
find a new best friend.

38:24.594 --> 38:28.973
No, way. Uncle Lou
is my best friend.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.267
You excited to have
a new teacher?

38:31.476 --> 38:32.852
Super excited.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.729
Yeah, I think you're
gonna like him.

38:34.938 --> 38:39.067
L've known him forever.
He's a wonderful musician.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.687
That was beautiful.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.397
You are truly gifted.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.607
Thank you.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.359
Ready to try
something different?

39:21.568 --> 39:23.194
Sure. Yeah.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.155
Okay. This is where we're going.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.963
Now, what I want you
to do now is just...

39:42.171 --> 39:45.884
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

39:46.092 --> 39:49.512
<i>♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

39:49.721 --> 39:50.930
Find it.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.816
That's it.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.071
You got it. Yeah, yeah.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.949
Okay. Okay, now let's pick
it up a little bit, huh?

40:10.158 --> 40:12.827
Let's take it to...

40:25.048 --> 40:28.593
Come on, come on.
Pick up a little bit.

40:31.888 --> 40:37.393
Yeah, take it somewhere now.
Take it somewhere.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.271
That's okay, it's okay.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.191
You're doing fine.
Hey, little darling.

40:43.399 --> 40:47.028
What's wrong? We're not
finished just yet.

40:47.236 --> 40:48.905
I would like to call Ginny.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.324
Is something the matter?

40:51.532 --> 40:52.909
L'm wanna go home.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.830
Why so sudden?

40:58.039 --> 41:00.625
I don't feel well.

41:00.833 --> 41:04.504
Oh, well, if you
don't feel well,

41:04.712 --> 41:06.923
then by all means, but, uh...

41:07.131 --> 41:09.592
you're not leaving
because something else

41:09.801 --> 41:12.387
is bothering you, are you?

41:12.553 --> 41:16.599
I don't like that music.
I don't want to play it.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.518
You ever play the blues before?

41:20.603 --> 41:22.522
Then how you know
you don't like it?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.273
You can't say you
don't like something

41:24.482 --> 41:28.111
- till after you tried it.
- I just did.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.781
Little darling, almost
catch the rabbit

41:31.990 --> 41:33.491
don't make a stew.

41:33.700 --> 41:36.077
You can't eat no rabbit
you almost caught.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.789
I don't eat rabbit stew.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.251
All right then.

41:43.459 --> 41:45.586
Guess we better give
Ginny a holler.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.952
So if he's not your
dad, who is he?

42:18.161 --> 42:20.079
- It's a long story.
- We have all day.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.541
Hey, Love Puppy, and
Dreamweaver, order 27 is up.

42:23.750 --> 42:27.754
James is my father's best friend since
they were little. They both grow up here.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.566
It ain't gonna walk itself
to the table, all right?

42:30.590 --> 42:33.509
So why is he taking care
of you and your sister?

42:33.718 --> 42:36.471
Because both our
parents are dead.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.849
Enough with the commiserating.
Get back to work.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.809
No more flirty
flirting, you got it?

42:42.018 --> 42:43.936
- Yeah.
- How'd they pass away?

42:44.145 --> 42:45.271
Was it an accident?

42:45.480 --> 42:47.815
They worked in some
financial offices

42:48.024 --> 42:49.942
in the Twin Towers.

42:50.151 --> 42:51.986
You mean on 9/11?

42:54.113 --> 42:57.033
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.702
- It's not like any of this was your fault.
- I'm sorry...

43:02.580 --> 43:03.820
- Did James work in one of

43:03.832 --> 43:05.083
the buildings, too? - No.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.044
He was an artist, a painter.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.980
He had to give it up when
he started taking care

43:10.004 --> 43:12.048
- of me and Grace.
- How old was he?

43:12.256 --> 43:14.258
Like early 20s or something.

43:14.467 --> 43:16.094
That's pretty hard-core.

43:16.302 --> 43:18.387
I mean, like, one
second, you're this,

43:18.596 --> 43:20.973
like, cool New York City artist,

43:21.182 --> 43:23.726
and then the next, you're Mr.
Mom.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.937
I mean, damn.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.439
He must really love you guys
for him to give all that up.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.949
We should probably
get back to work.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.535
- Lou's gonna kill us.
- Oh, my God!

43:40.743 --> 43:42.870
I got two skeletons at table 27!

43:43.079 --> 43:45.206
The rest of the restaurant's
dying of starvation!

43:45.414 --> 43:48.584
Kindly hurry up! Let's go!

43:54.006 --> 43:56.092
See you later, bye.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.262
Another reason why
I don't drive.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.014
Can never find my bloody keys.

44:02.223 --> 44:05.685
Oh, always the last
place to look.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.479
How was your first day?

44:08.688 --> 44:11.440
It was a happy medium.
Yeah, that's all right.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.860
Couldn't have been as
bad as my first day.

44:14.068 --> 44:17.697
- Oh, yeah, why's that?
- I never actually made it here.

44:17.905 --> 44:19.907
I crashed my car into a fence.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.826
- Wow.
- Yeah.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.661
Couldn't actually believe

44:23.870 --> 44:26.080
there were white picket
fences here in America.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.625
- You thought that was only in the movies?
- Yeah, it was very distracting.

44:29.834 --> 44:33.087
My mind told me to take a left.
My heart told me to go right.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.107
You Americans couldn't keep
the damn steering wheel

44:35.131 --> 44:37.717
- on the right side, could you?
- Oh, well, what makes you Brits

44:37.925 --> 44:40.595
- think it's the right side?
- Oh, very clever.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.764
Thank you, been working on
my sense of humor all day.

44:43.973 --> 44:48.269
God, you gonna ask me if I
need a ride home or what?

44:48.477 --> 44:50.354
- Get in.
- Yes, sir.

44:50.563 --> 44:52.148
I gonna make a pit stop, though.

44:56.277 --> 45:00.072
When I was a young 'un
just about your age,

45:00.281 --> 45:03.951
my mama and daddy
worked two jobs

45:04.160 --> 45:07.163
to buy me my first piano.

45:07.371 --> 45:10.875
A Chickering.

45:11.083 --> 45:14.086
Some of the sweetest
sounds I ever heard

45:14.295 --> 45:18.090
came out of these
old wooden boxes.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.469
I called her Jolene.

45:21.677 --> 45:25.097
You got to name your
piano, little darling.

45:25.306 --> 45:28.684
Treat her good like
it's her best friend.

45:28.893 --> 45:32.063
They need love just like we do.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.232
And they got souls, too.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.488
My daddy was a musician, too.

45:40.696 --> 45:43.366
He was out there on the
road most of the time,

45:43.574 --> 45:48.162
but he took me along with him
from time to time when he could.

45:48.371 --> 45:52.667
That man could pick
up any instrument,

45:52.833 --> 45:54.710
any instrument, and
in a matter of hours,

45:54.919 --> 45:57.672
it was like they'd known
each other for years.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.382
Just had that ear, you know?

46:01.676 --> 46:03.386
He was a good man.

46:05.429 --> 46:08.391
He taught me to
appreciate the classics.

46:10.476 --> 46:13.187
Everyone's classics.

46:13.396 --> 46:18.651
My daddy said that all
music has a common root,

46:18.859 --> 46:20.152
but it ain't easy.

46:20.361 --> 46:23.406
You got to work at it,
and it takes discipline.

46:23.614 --> 46:27.827
But all music had a common root.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.539
Like it was spiritual.

46:35.209 --> 46:38.296
Ginny's here. I have to go.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.424
Yeah, well, we best
not keep her waiting.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.887
I love this place. I
come here all the time.

46:47.096 --> 46:50.391
Oh, my God! Bridgey, hi!

46:50.599 --> 46:52.643
Where have you been?

46:52.852 --> 46:54.696
- Okay, you're
desperately in need

46:54.708 --> 46:56.564
of Tiff's TLC.
- Tell me about it.

46:56.772 --> 46:58.816
How the heck do youse
two know each other?

46:59.025 --> 47:02.194
We just met at my
new job on campus.

47:02.403 --> 47:06.157
Oh, yeah, this is the girl
I was telling you about.

47:06.365 --> 47:09.577
Oh, this girl, the one who
works at the university

47:09.785 --> 47:11.245
that you forgot
that I worked at?

47:11.454 --> 47:12.974
- That girl, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

47:13.122 --> 47:15.017
- Right, that girl.
- I'm glad you two finally met.

47:15.041 --> 47:18.419
Get over here, you big
gorilla, come say hi.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.671
Gorilla coming through.
Hey, guys.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.590
- Buddy boy.
- Good first day, huh?

47:22.798 --> 47:24.884
How about this, whatever
you want's on house.

47:25.092 --> 47:27.094
Dino's eggplant
parm is to die for.

47:27.303 --> 47:31.390
I know, I did
almost die from it.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.726
Wait a minute, come
again and what?

47:33.934 --> 47:36.979
No. I had the worst
food poisoning.

47:37.188 --> 47:39.023
It was terrible.

47:39.231 --> 47:42.777
Yeah, sick as a donkey, just...
yeah.

47:42.943 --> 47:46.405
Well, I don't know what to say.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill Dino.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.616
You should not
have taken Mario's

47:48.824 --> 47:50.951
fell-off-the-back-of-a-truck
produce, I told you that!

47:51.160 --> 47:53.000
- It's too good to be true!
- He's your cousin!

47:53.120 --> 47:55.623
I was doing the family a favor!
I don't even like the...

47:55.831 --> 47:57.750
Yeah, you do! He'll
kill you in here!

47:57.917 --> 48:00.419
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No, I didn't! No, I didn't!

48:00.628 --> 48:04.048
Guys, guys, guys, QUYS-
I'm pulling your leg.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.092
It was a j... it was
a really bad joke.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.594
L'm fine. I'm really sorry.

48:08.803 --> 48:13.099
I love your food.
I love your food.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.184
- Lou... I love your food.
- You like my food?

48:15.393 --> 48:17.103
Best Italian around.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.397
Wait a minute, best
Italian around?

48:19.605 --> 48:21.291
- Yeah, best Italian around.
- You hear that, Tiff?

48:21.315 --> 48:24.193
How you like me now?
Best around.

48:24.402 --> 48:27.988
Best around. Bing, bong!
See you later!

48:28.197 --> 48:30.967
- You like to stir the pot.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.078
- You ready to go or what?
- I'm waiting for you.

48:34.286 --> 48:36.455
Yeah, well, I've been
waiting all day.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.144
You got your hands
full with that one.

48:38.249 --> 48:41.377
Okay. Yeah.

48:41.585 --> 48:45.047
You two have to come out with
us on the town, the four of us.

48:45.256 --> 48:46.799
After you come see me.

48:47.007 --> 48:49.635
What are you... no.
I just met her.

48:49.844 --> 48:52.263
- Okay? We're not dating.
- I'm standing right here.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.014
It's gonna be fun! Loosen up!

48:54.223 --> 48:55.663
I got my daughter
waiting in the car.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.643
- You're welcome.
- He's very uptight.

48:57.852 --> 48:59.937
Here. Take this with you.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.939
Never know when you're
gonna get the blues.

49:02.148 --> 49:03.482
Thanks.

49:03.691 --> 49:07.736
Boy, why don't you
use your keys?

49:07.945 --> 49:10.865
Mind your manners now and
say hello to Miss Grace.

49:11.073 --> 49:12.992
Hi, Miss Grace.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.326
Hi.

49:18.289 --> 49:21.750
Hey, kid, you come back
anytime you want, okay?

49:21.959 --> 49:24.920
Maybe next time, you
try some rabbit.

49:25.129 --> 49:27.923
Yeah. Okay.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.300
Bye.

49:33.179 --> 49:35.431
So how was your
first day at work?

49:35.639 --> 49:37.725
Actually, surprisingly
not that bad,

49:37.933 --> 49:39.828
but I still hate it here
and pray to God every day

49:39.852 --> 49:41.729
that we're gonna go home.

49:41.937 --> 49:45.441
Well, honey, this is home now, okay?
So...

49:45.649 --> 49:47.836
You know, I felt the same way
when I first moved here.

49:47.860 --> 49:51.030
Moves can be really scary
and definitely lonely,

49:51.238 --> 49:53.949
but once you settle in,
it does get better.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.910
Well, it's different

49:56.118 --> 49:58.245
because you weren't
abducted at gunpoint.

49:58.454 --> 50:00.456
That's true. Slightly dramatic.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.917
But I definitely
wasn't abducted.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.752
I can tell you one
thing, though.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.296
It's the best
decision I ever made.

50:07.505 --> 50:08.714
Change is good.

50:08.923 --> 50:11.425
It's, uh... it's
good for the soul.

50:11.634 --> 50:13.093
If you have one.

50:13.302 --> 50:15.471
Maybe in a couple of years,

50:15.679 --> 50:17.723
you can go back
there for college.

50:17.932 --> 50:19.391
If I can make it that long,

50:19.600 --> 50:21.101
that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

50:21.310 --> 50:24.855
Brilliant. Buffalo's
really not that bad.

50:25.064 --> 50:26.690
If you want, I can
take you around.

50:26.899 --> 50:30.694
We could go clubbing,
get some ugly tattoos,

50:30.903 --> 50:32.672
pick up boys... look at your
father's face right now.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.908
- No, he's...
- I'm not... l'm not her father.

50:36.116 --> 50:39.119
Sorry, kid, I was just beating
you to the punch there.

50:43.123 --> 50:45.376
Um, actually, this is
me up on the right.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.836
- Okay.
- Alexis, it was lovely to meet you.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.548
- And I hope to see you soon.
- Bye.

50:50.756 --> 50:53.592
- Thank you for the ride. - lt's
my pressure... I mean pleasure.

50:53.801 --> 50:57.972
Try not to abduct
any more children.

50:58.138 --> 50:59.306
Well, I'll do my best.

50:59.515 --> 51:01.433
- Yeah, try really hard.
- Okay.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.143
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.941
I like her. Ls she
your new girlfriend?

51:09.149 --> 51:13.279
Wh... what makes you say that?
I just met the girl.

51:13.487 --> 51:15.823
Didn't think so. She's
not your type anyway.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.616
Oh, really? And why's that?

51:17.825 --> 51:19.743
- She's too cool for you.
- Oh, is that right?

51:19.952 --> 51:21.870
Mm-hmm.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.790
Oh, no, oh, my God.

51:24.999 --> 51:29.295
Turn that off! Oh, my
God, you're so annoying!

51:29.503 --> 51:31.463
I hate you, you little...

51:40.306 --> 51:41.890
So...

51:42.099 --> 51:43.559
How's it going?

51:43.767 --> 51:47.146
You know. Awesome.

51:47.354 --> 51:48.606
Just give it some time.

51:48.814 --> 51:51.900
Yeah, I know, time.
You said that before.

51:52.109 --> 51:54.028
Where's Grace? How'd it go?

51:56.238 --> 51:58.616
Awesome.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.035
I can't catch a break.

52:04.747 --> 52:06.790
Peanut?

52:06.999 --> 52:10.252
I heard you didn't
like it at Robert's.

52:10.461 --> 52:13.047
You wanna tell me what happened?

52:13.213 --> 52:15.674
I don't like it here anymore.

52:15.883 --> 52:17.843
Okay, why not?

52:18.052 --> 52:20.346
Because I just don't.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.682
I understand, but you
gotta try, right?

52:23.891 --> 52:28.145
- I don't want to. I want to go back home.
- Ls it a teacher thing?

52:28.354 --> 52:29.748
You want me to find you
a different teacher?

52:29.772 --> 52:31.857
No, Dad, I just want
to go back home.

52:32.066 --> 52:34.401
This is where we live now, okay?

52:34.610 --> 52:36.546
And you and your sister are
just gonna have to try

52:36.570 --> 52:38.572
to adjust to it, you're
gonna have to try.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.700
- But I don't want to.
- Right, you don't want to.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.830
Grace, sometimes in life,

52:47.039 --> 52:50.542
you gotta do things
you don't want to do.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.586
It's not fair!

52:53.796 --> 52:54.796
Grace.

52:57.257 --> 53:00.427
That's not very nice, is it?
This is somebody's art.

53:00.636 --> 53:03.430
You wouldn't like it if
someone crumpled up your art

53:03.639 --> 53:06.558
and threw it on the
floor, would you?

53:06.767 --> 53:08.727
L'm putting it here so you
have to think about it.

53:08.852 --> 53:11.689
Dinner's gonna be ready
in half an hour.

53:11.897 --> 53:14.066
- L'm not hungry.
- Right, I get it.

53:14.274 --> 53:15.526
Leave me alone.

53:26.537 --> 53:29.164
<i>♪ Don't talk to me</i>

53:29.373 --> 53:33.001
♪ <i>'Bout</i> that moon up above

54:21.717 --> 54:25.179
Um... is this a date?

54:25.387 --> 54:29.391
I don't know, what
constitutes a date for you?

54:29.600 --> 54:32.811
No idea. We don't
date in England.

54:33.020 --> 54:36.523
You don't date in England?
What would you call this?

54:36.690 --> 54:40.277
Um, going out.

54:40.486 --> 54:41.779
- Out?
- Yeah.

54:41.987 --> 54:45.073
I mean, I guess we're outside.
This is out.

54:47.826 --> 54:51.413
So what's your story?
Always a teacher?

54:51.622 --> 54:53.457
Was that always the
life path or what?

54:53.665 --> 54:57.294
- Was it yours?
- Not really, no.

54:57.503 --> 55:01.757
Yeah, me either. No, I'm...
l'm a writer.

55:01.965 --> 55:05.803
A playwright... I mean, I was...
back in England, I was...

55:06.011 --> 55:08.806
I'm sensing this is something
you don't want to talk about.

55:09.014 --> 55:10.808
Very perceptive of
you, James, yeah.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.559
You know what's interesting?

55:12.768 --> 55:15.145
You're not masking
it with humor.

55:15.354 --> 55:16.814
Oh, my God, are
you analyzing me?

55:17.022 --> 55:20.234
L'm not analyzing you, no.
I'm just...

55:20.442 --> 55:23.320
I'm just curious. What's...
what's your story?

55:23.529 --> 55:25.197
Story, um...

55:25.405 --> 55:28.784
My story is very long
and quite boring

55:28.992 --> 55:31.745
and I don't really
wanna talk about it.

55:31.954 --> 55:33.705
All right. Well, listen.

55:33.914 --> 55:36.250
It was nice knowing you.
We had a good run, right?

55:36.458 --> 55:38.502
If you want to get home,
you just jump over there

55:38.710 --> 55:40.254
and swim back, see you later.

55:40.462 --> 55:42.130
The city bus'll pick
you up up there.

55:42.339 --> 55:43.924
Are you ending the
date right now?

55:44.132 --> 55:45.759
Oh, is this a date?

55:45.968 --> 55:48.011
I thought we were
just going out.

55:48.220 --> 55:49.346
Fuck.

55:51.390 --> 55:52.975
You really gonna
make me tell you?

55:53.183 --> 55:56.979
- I told you my story.
- Fine, fine.

55:57.187 --> 56:00.274
Fine. Oh, my God, um...
okay, I...

56:02.568 --> 56:06.697
I wrote a play. A
really good play.

56:06.905 --> 56:10.576
- And my ex-boyfriend...
- Oh, I don't like this guy already.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.703
Will you just shush so
I can finish the story

56:12.911 --> 56:15.956
- that you really want to hear.
- I'm zipped.

56:16.164 --> 56:18.333
All right, my ex-boyfriend,
he was also a playwright,

56:18.542 --> 56:21.169
and he read my play, and
he really liked it.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.714
And so he took it, and
he made it his own,

56:23.922 --> 56:27.134
and he put it up,
and he, you know,

56:27.342 --> 56:30.429
technically, stole my play.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.472
You mean he plagiarized
your work?

56:32.681 --> 56:36.518
I... I actually... I let him.

56:36.727 --> 56:37.936
What?

56:38.145 --> 56:39.354
Yeah, no, I gave it to him.

56:39.563 --> 56:41.273
I said he could put
his name on it.

56:41.481 --> 56:43.859
I was really young

56:44.067 --> 56:47.321
and really naive and
really in love.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.406
Jesus Christ, I, uh...

56:49.615 --> 56:52.534
And it was a mistake. It
was a really big mistake.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.746
Someone taking credit for work
I did is like my worst...

56:55.954 --> 56:57.789
that is my worst
nightmare as an artist.

56:57.998 --> 56:59.791
Yeah, no, it was
quite nightmarish,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.461
but I realized how toxic
our relationship was,

57:02.669 --> 57:05.213
and I decided I needed a change.

57:05.422 --> 57:08.342
<i>And</i> I <i>came to America.</i>

57:08.508 --> 57:13.305
America.

57:13.472 --> 57:16.141
L'm impressed at how
you handled that.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.185
I would have been a
ball of resentment.

57:18.393 --> 57:21.647
My mother always said resentment
is like drinking poison

57:21.813 --> 57:24.650
and expecting the
other person to die.

57:24.858 --> 57:26.902
Your mom sounds
like a smart lady.

57:27.110 --> 57:30.322
Yeah, yeah, she
was a smart lady.

57:30.530 --> 57:33.492
So, yeah, I moved on.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.620
I scraped myself off the
floor and started afresh

57:36.828 --> 57:41.750
and, um... you know, choices.

57:43.377 --> 57:45.170
We learn to make better choices

57:45.379 --> 57:49.049
and try not to make
the same mistakes.

57:49.257 --> 57:53.512
And don't fall in
love with, um...

57:53.720 --> 57:55.305
- Thieves?
- Yes, thieves!

57:55.514 --> 57:56.974
- Robbers?
- Yes!

57:57.182 --> 57:59.184
Assassins of dreams?

57:59.393 --> 58:01.144
- And narcissists.
- And narcissists.

58:01.353 --> 58:04.147
Yeah. The end.

58:04.356 --> 58:08.235
That's... that's the...
the end...

58:08.443 --> 58:10.612
of my story.

58:19.037 --> 58:20.497
L'm... l'm hungry.

58:20.706 --> 58:22.416
- L'm hungry, too.
- Yes.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.501
- Can I buy you dinner?
- Yes.

58:24.710 --> 58:29.006
- Yes? Shall we?
- Yeah.

58:29.214 --> 58:32.509
All right, so...

58:32.718 --> 58:34.928
Well, I'm... l'm just curious.

58:35.137 --> 58:36.489
- Yeah?
- What's the play called?

58:36.513 --> 58:37.931
- No.
- No, come on.

58:38.140 --> 58:39.826
And then I won't say
anything more about it.

58:39.850 --> 58:43.353
- You wouldn't have heard of it.
- Try me.

58:43.562 --> 58:47.607
Okay, it was a play called...
ugh... Ship to Carrier.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.568
- No way.
- Oh, fuck off.

58:49.776 --> 58:51.254
- Ship to Carrier?
- You haven't heard of it.

58:51.278 --> 58:52.612
Yes, I have!

58:52.821 --> 58:54.573
Alexis was in that play
at her high school.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.159
L've read that play.
That's your play?

58:57.367 --> 59:00.370
- That's a great play.
- Yeah, no shit, I wrote it.

59:00.579 --> 59:03.415
- Well, allegedly. Allegedly.
- I'm gonna hit you.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.714
- I miss you.
- Same.

59:10.922 --> 59:13.216
Why won't you Skype?

59:13.425 --> 59:16.636
<i>'Cause my Wi-Fi isn't
working at the house.</i>

59:16.845 --> 59:20.891
You're such a liar. I
know you're not at home.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.100
<i>Yeah, I am.</i>

59:26.104 --> 59:28.440
You can call me on
the home phone.

59:28.648 --> 59:30.942
<i>Damn, girl, why you bugging?</i>

59:31.151 --> 59:34.488
I'm not, just call me
on the home phone.

59:34.696 --> 59:37.783
<i>Look, I gotta bounce, okay? My
moms wants to take me to dinner.</i>

59:37.991 --> 59:40.231
That's fucking bullshit. I
know your parents aren't home.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.162
I know they're in Europe.

59:42.370 --> 59:45.165
Look, I'll holler at you later
when you cool the hell out.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.625
All right? - Are you kidding me?

59:46.833 --> 59:48.919
Oscar, don't you
dare hang up on me.

59:49.127 --> 59:51.630
<i>Yo, you're breaking up.
I can't hear you.</i>

59:51.838 --> 59:53.965
- Oscar!
- Peace.

59:54.174 --> 59:55.217
Oscar!

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.102
<i>At the tone...</i>

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:11.107
<i>At the tone...</i>

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.685
Okay, you've been cheating
on me with somebody.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.563
I can tell, but they
didn't do a bad job.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.773
Gracie, pumpkin?

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:54.276
You know, I love having you
here more than anything,

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.504
but would do you really
rather sweep this nasty hair,

01:00:56.528 --> 01:00:59.489
not yours, of course, than play
that beautiful instrument?

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.825
L'm just trying to
figure things out.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:04.369
Well, you'd better hurry it up.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:06.806
We don't want you to end up
being a janitor or something.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.540
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.167
My first husband was a janitor.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.836
Actually, there was
something wrong with that.

01:01:13.044 --> 01:01:15.672
- You were married before?
- I was.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:18.758
- Does Uncle Lou know?
- I hope so.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:22.220
He moved me out of my ex's place
when I started dating him.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.848
- Wow.
- Don't get all judgy with me.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.909
You're the one sweeping
floors when you should be

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.935
sweeping hearts playing
that pretty music

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.464
in concert halls
or what have you.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.524
Well, this is clearly
not my work,

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.318
but I'll fix it, don't worry.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.778
You need to loosen up. I'm
gonna massage your face.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:41.615
We're gonna get some
champagne in you.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.617
It's going to be fine.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.665
All right, I'm leaving.
How do I look?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:54.377
Actually, surprisingly cool.
Just untuck the shirt.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:56.226
You look like a math
teacher or something.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.423
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on, you're an art teacher.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.051
- Okay.
- How come we can't go?

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:04.012
Because he's going on a
double date, stupid.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.514
- Shut up, Alexis.
- Don't call her stupid.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.227
Listen, I'm leaving you in charge.
I want Grace in bed by 11:00.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.938
Wait, what? I'm not a
little kid anymore.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:16.024
Fine, I will be home
before then anyway.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.026
L'm trusting you.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.528
Trusting you-Don't
be so melodramatic.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:22.465
This isn't the first
time I've watched her.

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.823
That's what I'm worried about.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.700
Just go, have a fun time.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:28.662
We'll be here
watching this movie.

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:31.289
- It's okay.
- Wanna give me a hug?

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.500
- Wanna wish me good luck?
- Mnh-mnh.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.546
L'm trusting you guys.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.399
- Yep. You know you can.
- Behave yourself.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:42.175
All right. See you.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:47.347
Okay, text James in an
hour, ask him where he is

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.767
and when he's coming home,
then text me what he says.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:52.560
- Got it?
- Why?

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.105
'Cause I'm going out.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:56.313
Good kid.

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:59.985
Ooh... you're in trouble.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.904
EYES, eyes, eyes, eyes.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:06.157
Eyes, eyes, eyes,
eyes on the menu now

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:07.909
so I can order my food.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.394
Alexander breaks out
this big bag of weed.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.730
Get the... it was your
weed, not Alex's.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.023
Stop it now. Go ahead.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.358
Anyway, we smoke
the whole pound.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.444
It's a pound out of
a six-foot bong,

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.612
- nonetheless, which was yours.
- That was mine.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.698
Only reason I know it's six foot

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:48.843
'cause he's standing next to it
and the bong would be up here.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.928
He'd have to stand up on the
stair and go like this...

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:52.162
That is also true.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:00.795
Listen, <i>behave</i> yourselves.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:04.758
<i>Ooh... you're gonna
be in big trouble.</i>

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.787
What are you looking at?

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:26.464
So we go to this diner, okay?

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.425
And we eat like kings.
Like kings.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.403
I mean everything. You
name it, we order it.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.513
Now, the bill comes. We had
planned to dine and dash.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:35.616
- You know what that is?
- Yes, I know what that is.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.308
- You have that in England.
- Yes, we do.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.269
Okay, now, what
we don't realize.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:40.937
Place we're in? Ready for this?

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:43.648
It's only a local cop
diner, that's all.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.984
- No.
- Three knuckleheads.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.903
And what does this
moron Alexander do?

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:52.782
Eats a French fry or something,
right, off the cop's plate.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:55.118
But wait a minute. It wasn't
just one cop's plate.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.912
Four cops, five cops, every
plate he could find,

01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.723
he's grabbing food,
throwing it everywhere.

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.541
- It's a sea of blue.
- Cops everywhere.

01:06:01.749 --> 01:06:03.835
You get arrested?

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.004
So we make a mad dash
for the front door.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:08.506
- HeHo, honey?
- Two cops end up walking in there...

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.758
Hello... what?

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:13.720
Honey, I... slow down.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:16.973
- Where's Alexis?
- Jimmy, what's up?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:19.142
Okay, hold on, I'll
be right there, okay?

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.769
I'll be right there.
I'm on my way.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.063
Please explain.

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:26.691
We have to go. I'm sorry.
We have to go.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.461
- We'll get it.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:29.611
Do what you gotta do.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:59.474
- Where's Alexis?
- She's not home yet.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.285
- L'm gonna wring her neck.
- Just calm down.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:02.989
Gracie, come here. Let
me see you, darling.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:05.939
Are you all right?
Let's see, ohh.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:08.942
She's fine. Lt's...
it's a sprain.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.527
There's no broken bones.

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.421
She'll be in fighting
form in no time at all.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.948
- Don't you worry.
- Okay.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.951
Uh, sorry, Bridget,
this is my mom, Ginny.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:20.453
- Hello, Mrs. Maxwell.
- Just call me Ginny.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.163
- Never a dull moment here.
- No.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.831
Let's get you
upstairs, precious.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.001
Come on, you must be so tired.
Come on.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.462
L'm going to be right back.
Okay? Sorry.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:30.838
Don't be sorry.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:01.119
Hey-

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:04.581
James has been looking for you.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.499
SQ?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.751
Why are you even here?

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.548
Oh, well, your sister got
hurt, and I wanted to help.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:19.136
Well... we don't need your help.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.889
So why don't you just leave?

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.268
Because they all
eventually do anyway.

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:28.438
That's not very polite.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.274
Because I'm British and proper,

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:36.154
and we have manners, not
like you silly Americans.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:38.823
Fuck, I hope I don't
talk like that.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.658
All right, let's get you to bed.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.118
Don't touch me.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:43.911
Hey, where were you?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.874
Why weren't you
watching your sister?

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:50.292
What's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:53.962
Yes. And I was at a party.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.175
With boys and
drinking and smoking.

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.843
Are you even aware
that while you

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.732
were out celebrating,
your sister got hurt?

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.531
Does that even occur to you
in your selfish little world?

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.265
- L'm gonna go.
- If you could just wait one second.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.644
- Does it?
- I hate you.

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:11.104
I hate it here. I hate
this whole fucking place.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.983
I don't understand you anymore.
You used to be my friend.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:15.752
You used to want to
be good and hang out.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:18.488
- What happened? ls it my fault?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.573
Is it my little
friend-on-friend experiment?

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.283
- Is that what's gone wrong?
- Why'd you even do that?

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.996
Did you just feel bad that
my parents were dead?

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:29.415
When did you become so nasty?

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:32.794
Maybe when I realized
that you were all I got.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:34.462
You know what you are?

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.964
You are an ungrateful,
spoiled little girl.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.466
That's what you are. Excuse me.
You are not an adult!

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.344
You are a little girl,
you understand?!

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:46.307
Yeah, I know I'm not as
precious as your little Grace.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:50.478
L'm not perfect like her. I'm
just a big pain in your ass!

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:53.481
- Well, you said it, not me!
- Fuck you.

01:09:56.901 --> 01:10:00.446
I'm sorry.

01:10:00.655 --> 01:10:02.949
It's okay.

01:10:03.157 --> 01:10:04.784
I just can't take her
anymore, you know?

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.120
- I get it. Yeah.
- You know? Yeah.

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:12.125
Maybe let her sober up,
talk to her in the morning.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.459
Mm-hmm.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:21.676
Um... l'm gonna go and
get her some water.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.010
Okay.

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.595
Where's the kitchen?

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.973
- Oh, the kitchen that way.
- Okay.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:29.559
- I can get it for you.
- I'm okay.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.898
I like your room.

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.984
Thank you.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.610
Just keep drinking this.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.617
Why wouldn't you tell me what
it's like to have a teenager?

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.912
How could you forget
to tell me about that?

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:52.665
If I had, would you
have believed me?

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.713
Lt'll be all right.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.521
You're not the first
parent to feel this,

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.717
and you certainly won't
be the last, you know.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:08.222
I gotta go. I'm tired.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.934
I love you, Mama.

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:16.439
Oh, that new girl upstairs.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.149
- Yeah?
- I like her.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:20.526
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, she's a keeper.

01:11:20.735 --> 01:11:23.154
Don't screw that up.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:25.156
- Love ya.
- Love you.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:40.046
I, um... think you need
a rather large drink.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.425
Okay. Cheers.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.386
Cheers. Kids.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.267
Want to hang out a little bit?

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:55.520
Um...

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:59.232
After all that, I can
understand if you didn't.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.818
Yeah, I'll hang out.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:07.031
- Cool.
- Cool.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:12.119
That's from a long time ago.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.998
That's probably from
11, 12 years ago.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:19.502
These are all from
a long time ago.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.046
Anything from this decade?

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:27.009
Mmm...

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:28.886
James, when was the
last time you painted?

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:33.224
I mean, I paint all the time,
when I'm teaching, so.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:35.643
That's not what I meant.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:36.852
Um...

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.732
I start and stop a lot.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:43.627
I haven't finished
anything in a long time

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:46.070
- that I'm proud of, so...
- Why?

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:50.783
I'll give you two guesses.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:53.786
Oh. They're the excuse.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:58.958
No, they're not an excuse.
They're a reality, okay?

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.961
It's hard to raise kids and
be a struggling artist.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.593
These are really beautiful.

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.678
- Thanks.
- I love the colors.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.805
It makes me uncomfortable,
but thanks.

01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:14.932
They should be on
someone's wall.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.727
Yeah, they're... they are.
They're on my wall.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.687
I see them. Who else
needs to see them?

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.231
- L'm being serious.
- So am I.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:27.069
Okay, fine, we'll save this
conversation for another day.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.738
- Oh, will we?
- To be continued.

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:30.591
Well, that's presumptuous
of you to think

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:32.283
that it's gonna be continued.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:35.244
Are you just gonna keep talking
or are you gonna kiss me?

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:51.093
- You want another one?
- Yes.

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:52.762
- Kiss or scotch?
- Both.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.805
Which order?

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.014
Um...

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:29.382
Bridget, Bridget,
we gotta get up.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.759
- Five more minutes.
- Come on, you gotta get up.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:34.345
You gotta get up, okay? Get up.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.931
- Good morning.
- Come on.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.308
Oh, my God, we really
drank that whole bottle.

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:42.395
Pretty much.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.605
Come on, you gotta get up, okay?

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:47.316
Caffeine. I need some caffeine.

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:49.902
Coffee or tea would be
really great right now.

01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:51.588
L'll get it for you on
the way home, okay?

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.781
We gotta get up, okay? Come on.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:57.827
Oh, uh... okay.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:03.207
I guess now would be a good time
to tell you I was a virgin.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:07.003
- What?
- That was... that was as a joke.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:09.088
Okay, we really gotta go.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:11.257
I can't have you here
if the girls are here.

01:15:11.465 --> 01:15:13.759
It's a mistake, okay? Come on.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.428
- Yeah, - Come on, let's go.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:16.887
Okay, okay.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.142
Can you pass me my dress?

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.076
Listen...

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:44.457
With everything going on
with the girls, I don't...

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:46.250
lt's fine.

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:48.127
No, I just don't...

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:53.090
I can't be emotionally available
for somebody else's needs.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.717
I understand.

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:57.011
I can see you have
enough stress as it is.

01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:00.097
I don't want to add to it.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:04.560
But, um... but for the record,
what happened last night,

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:07.063
I wanted it to happen.

01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:09.190
It wasn't a mistake for me.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:12.276
Hold on a minute, Bridget,
that's not what I meant.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.987
Bridget, that's not what I
meant when I said that, I...

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:42.807
Just wanted to apologize
for last night.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:46.268
L'm really sorry
that Grace got hurt.

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.938
I should have been
there, and I know that.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.898
I screwed up.

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:54.443
But it won't happen
again, I promise.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:57.947
Okay. Okay.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.950
L'm actually pleased you can
acknowledge your mistake.

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:04.453
That's mature of you.
It is. It is.

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.455
Yeah, you know why? You
know why I'm pleased?

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:10.251
You know why I believe you?
Because you're grounded, okay?

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.169
You're grounded until
I say otherwise.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.130
You can't do that. I've
never been grounded.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:17.842
- Well, it starts now, okay?
- That's fucking bullshit.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.927
Keep your voice down.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:23.347
That computer and that
phone are mine now, okay?

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.200
- I am taking them away.
- You can't do that.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:27.393
I can't? Until you
get your own money

01:17:27.601 --> 01:17:29.601
and you pay for your own
things, they belong to me.

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:31.036
- Do you understand?
- What about

01:17:31.048 --> 01:17:32.415
the money my parents
left for us?

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:33.524
What happened to that?

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.654
This house, this house
belonged to me.

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:41.073
I fu... no, it belonged to
my fucking mother, okay?

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:43.159
I... she's nice enough
because I respect her

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.410
to let us live here.

01:17:44.618 --> 01:17:47.037
Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.999
Say one more word, and
I am taking that,

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:52.751
and I am flushing it
down the fucking toilet.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.254
- You think...
- Don't say another fucking word.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:04.305
You're grounded. Get your
shit and go upstairs.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.057
Leave it there and go upstairs.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.767
Fuck.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.698
Yeah?

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.622
Does he get the girl in the end?

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.499
Nope. She kills him.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:41.008
Can we talk about what
happened with us?

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.802
Us? Since when have
we been an us?

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.598
Well, I mean...

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:53.395
- We did consummate our...
- Our what?

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:55.773
Are we going steady now?

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:59.401
Because I specifically remember
you singing a different tune.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.654
Emotionally unavailable,
if I recall.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.530
Yeah, but I...

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.742
You know, the next time
you insert your manhood

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:08.577
into a woman, regardless
of whatever else

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.663
is going on in your life,

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:12.831
try not to tell her
it was a mistake.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.251
I didn't mean it like that.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.170
Get out of the habit of saying
things you don't mean, James.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:26.971
Look...

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.685
I woke up the other morning...

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:37.231
- Mm-hmm.
- And I panicked, okay?

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.733
With everything that
happened with Alexis

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.443
and just the girls, in general.

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:47.157
There's a protocol I have
to follow with kids.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.576
Or at least I try to
follow, you understand?

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:53.080
- Mm-hmm.
- And... I got flustered.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:57.126
It's okay. Let's make not make
this more than what it really is.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:59.211
We are adults, and
sometimes adults

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.047
just get drunk and
shag, it's fine.

01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:12.224
- Can't we just start ov...
- I have a lot of work to do.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.648
Okay.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:22.318
Hey.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.112
Can you shut the door?

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:27.948
Sure.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.710
Fuck.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:05.027
What are you doing? Ow!
You're hurting my wrist!

01:21:05.235 --> 01:21:08.238
- Give it back!
- Let go, shush!

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:11.367
Grace! Enough.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:13.577
Shh, settle, settle,
settle down!

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:15.788
- Shh.
- Stop it.

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:17.057
Stop it, Alexis,
you're so annoying!

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:19.083
Guys! Get your shoes on.

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:20.571
We're going to the
grocery store.

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.253
Why do I have to go
and she doesn't?

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.798
I said so. Stop talking
over me, Grace.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:27.886
Listen, Ginny's coming
here to take care of you.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:29.843
She's not going to be
here for a minute.

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:31.970
Are you okay by
yourself while we go?

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.680
- Yes. Yes.
- Are you sure?

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.307
You're not gonna
climb up on tables

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:36.860
- and try and get things

01:21:36.872 --> 01:21:38.227
off shelves, right? - No.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.562
No monkey business.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:42.815
- L'm watching you.
- All right.

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:44.733
What happened to Bridget?

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:46.527
Haven't seen her around lately.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.671
L'm not gonna talk about
that with you right now.

01:21:48.695 --> 01:21:50.948
She's bored of you already.
That was fast.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:52.616
Much faster than
the other girls.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.452
- Ninety-nine, Black Forest ham.
- That's me, thank you.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.373
How much longer am
I grounded for?

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.583
Until I see a real
change in your attitude,

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:04.753
not this manipulative crap
you do to get what you want.

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:06.422
That's bullshit, okay, I work,

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.632
and I do everything
you ask me to do.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:10.968
Keep it up, Okay?

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:14.138
You know, I never I'm never
gonna forgive you for this.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:17.224
And that, my dear, is exactly
why you are still grounded.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.062
We don't like that bread.

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:32.984
You don't want people to know
about it, don't talk about it.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.385
What I'm saying is how in God's
name did you screw that up

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:37.137
because that girl's an angel?

01:23:37.346 --> 01:23:38.786
Her heart's as big
as Lou's fat head.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:40.849
I don't want to talk
about it, okay?

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:43.560
- I don't want to talk about it.
- To be fair, I think James

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.188
- is kind of out of practice.
- What?

01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:48.732
L'm not out of practice on anything.
That is not the case.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.651
I think being raised
by a single mother,

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.946
- that you should know better.
- Are you not gonna let this go?

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:56.823
- Can you please let this go?
- Don't leave me out in the cold.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:00.118
- You gotta fill me in.
- There's nothing to bring you in on, man.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.829
I promise, there's nothing
to bring you in on, okay?

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:06.792
James's... crush, they...
they just kind of

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.127
- weren't singing the same song.
- That's not true.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:10.712
- That's not the case.
- Oh, no?

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.340
Who tells a girl the morning
you slide the pepperoni

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.385
into the calzone that it was...
look, she knows...

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.220
What, that it was a mistake?

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:21.056
Who does that, Jimmy? I'll tell you.
A schmuck.

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:22.808
Ease up on my boy!

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:24.977
Probably hammered out of
his mind that morning.

01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:28.188
Sometimes we guys say things we
don't mean the way you take it.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:32.901
My sentiments exactly, okay?
Yes, it's a slip of the tongue.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.861
No, that's what you
should've been doing.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.947
With your mouth. In
front of my mother.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.574
You think she doesn't know?

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:40.617
L'm going to help Lou and
Dino in the kitchen.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:42.470
Don't tell them what
they slaved all day

01:24:42.494 --> 01:24:43.996
making for dinner was a mistake.

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:46.498
We got a deal! We got a deal!

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:48.584
Don't listen to 'em. You
should know by now.

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.711
They're all cuckoo
for Cocoa Puffs.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:53.130
- Favorite color.
- Orange.

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.090
Brown. Favorite food.

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:56.925
Uncle Lou's spaghetti meatballs.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:58.774
I like the cheeseburger
with French fries.

01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:02.306
Hey, that's my second favorite.
I have a really good one.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:05.434
Okay, what animal would you
most want to get as a pet,

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.853
but like, you can't
say a dog or a cat.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:09.855
Easy, a Pig-

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.523
No way, me, too.

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:13.835
L'm still working on my dad
to try and get one, though.

01:25:13.859 --> 01:25:16.028
- That would be so cool.
- I know, right?

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:18.155
- Wanna play something together?
- Sure.

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.365
! Suggestions?

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:22.868
<i>How about When the
Saints Go Marching In?</i>

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.578
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.288
One, two, three.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:40.218
I really like that shirt.
Where'd you get it?

01:25:40.427 --> 01:25:42.846
Do you think I would look
good with a pixie cut?

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:44.806
Do I think I would...

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.100
Hey, can I use your phone
to check lnstagram?

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:48.477
Yeah.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:49.936
- Thanks.
- Why?

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:52.439
King Asshole took my phone away.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:55.859
OMG. I wouldn't even
be able to deal.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:58.570
Yeah, I know, it's
like losing a limb.

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:03.241
So there's a party tonight.
Think you can sneak out?

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:06.536
Christian will be there. I
think he's crushing on you.

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:11.124
Are you still dating that
cute boy from New York?

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.633
Tiff, pass the bread.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.593
If I can't have bread,
you can't have bread.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.321
You definitely don't
need any more bread.

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.972
Oh, my God, what the f...

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:31.061
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.146
Hello.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:35.273
Sorry I'm late.
Couldn't get a cab.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:36.733
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.318
Hi, here. Sit down.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.779
All right, <i>basta</i>
with the hellos.

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:43.865
Let's eat before this beautiful
food I made gets cold.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.534
I brought you a peace offering.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:47.136
Oh, well, that's
very nice of you.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.079
Figured we should lay
off the hard stuff.

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.997
- Yeah.
- Pun intended.

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.921
L'm really glad that you came.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.508
Okay, I'm gonna make this short
and sweet because I'm starving

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:04.428
and Tiffany's over here
drooling at the mouth, right?

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:06.864
- You're losing the rest of your hair.
- Oh, I love you.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:09.516
Okay, so, Jimmy, thank
you for having us.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:11.727
We love you. To family.

01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:13.246
There's nothing
better than this.

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.106
Friends old and new.
Your feast awaits.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.858
<i>' “Any - Many!</i>

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.277
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.696
- Salud.
- Salud, cheers, love you guys.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:26.199
Now may I please have the bread?

01:27:32.289 --> 01:27:33.558
L'm a drying machine. Let's go.

01:27:33.582 --> 01:27:35.250
Come on, come on.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:37.544
Thank you so much for dinner, Mr.
Maxwell.

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:40.630
Oh, my pleasure, Sarah.
Are you going somewhere?

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.679
- You leaving?
- I'm going to a friend's house.

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.885
Could you tell Alexis
I'll call her tomorrow?

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.471
Yeah, sure. Will do.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:48.805
Thank you.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:54.853
Last one.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.481
Oh, well, look at that.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:01.818
L'm telling you. You remember?
We found the trash in the trunk.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.653
You remember?

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:06.031
Wait a minute. Hey,
Jimmy, how about this?

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.919
Tell us about that catastrophic
attempt to make the basketball team!

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:11.077
Wait a minute, we're
in fifth grade,

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.580
fifth grade, he's 4'2" going
up against a guy 6'6"!

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:15.749
He keeps bouncing his head
off the guy's hip bone!

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:17.918
- - Ends up with a
mild concussion!

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.962
Oh, my God! He joins the debate team!
Jimmy...

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:25.175
lt's funny, no, it's funny.
Where's Alexis?

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:27.636
She's upstairs. She
went to lay down.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:30.055
- She's upstairs?
- She didn't feel well.

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:31.431
Excuse me one second.

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.558
Excuse me one
second, one second.

01:28:33.725 --> 01:28:35.560
That concussion never healed!

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.813
Alexis? You okay?

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:43.944
Alexis.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.616
Nobody knew the brakes were bad.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.265
So how were we
supposed to know that?

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:54.621
So we ended up getting lucky.
Huh? lt's crazy.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.666
Hey, hey, sorry,
she's not upstairs.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:28:59.301
- Are you sure? - I'm positive,

01:28:59.313 --> 01:29:00.752
and the back door is unlocked.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:03.129
Did you try her cell?

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.149
I can't try her cell. I
took it away from her.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:08.218
Sweetheart, where's your sister?

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.554
I... I don't know.
I swear, I don't.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:13.306
Maybe she snuck out,
met up with Sarah.

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:15.475
- You know where she is?
- You kidding me?

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.370
L've had this kid tracked
since she's born.

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:19.104
I know exactly where she is.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.481
<i>She's on Bus“ and Jersey Street.</i>

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.150
Lou, Dino, get your stuff.
We're going there, let's go.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.212
- Where's my Rocky...
- Time for Rocky? Oh, God.

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:27.279
Did you wash it?

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:32.200
<i>Buffalo, let's go!</i>

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:34.744
<i>- Are you ready?

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:38.290

<i>Hail it from the old first ward</i>

♪ Always keep a bad bitch on

You go upstairs. I'll
check the kitchen.

- Sarah!
- Oh, shit.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:20.081
Are you effing kidding
me right now?

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:21.499
Dad...

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:23.251
Listen to me. Where's Alexis?

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.045
I don't know, I swear.
She's not here.

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.564
All right, come on, we're go...

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.840
Eddie Jenkins?

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.343
Aren't you a little old to
be in a place like this?

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:33.591
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's
not what it looks like.

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:39.017
If I see this ever again,
ever, I swear to God

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:40.703
they're gonna find you in
pieces, you understand?

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:42.812
- Okay.
- And you.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:44.731
Back to the piss test. Let's go.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:49.653
Does anybody here know Alexis?

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:53.031
Nobody here knows Alexis? No?

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.700
Can you explain
this with the eggs?

01:30:55.909 --> 01:30:57.661
You guys are wasting food.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:30:59.829
Move. Alexis!

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:03.082
Alexis!

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:05.043
Down the hall, bro.

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:09.214
Alexis.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:16.221
Alexis!

01:31:16.429 --> 01:31:17.639
Alexis, open this door!

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:20.266
Jimmy, I looked downstairs.
No luck.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:22.078
No, no, they're in here.
I hear something.

01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.562
- Open this door!
- Step back.

01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:26.898
- - What the hell
is going on here?!

01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:30.068
Where the hell is Alexis?!
I knew you were...

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:33.279
Uh... oh... shit.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.407
Shit. I'm sorry.

01:31:35.573 --> 01:31:39.452
L-I'm looking for my daughter.
I didn't mean to intrude.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:40.704
L'm sorry.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:42.789
Have you seen a
girl named Alexis?

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:44.749
You haven't seen a
girl named Alex...

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.835
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

01:31:47.043 --> 01:31:49.838
- You're doing great.
- Carry on. Sorry about the door.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:53.508
- You hear from her?
- Not yet.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.510
This is all my fault, okay?

01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:58.596
She could be down a well somewhere.
Who knows where she could be.

01:31:58.805 --> 01:32:00.282
- This is all because of my mistakes.
- Dad!

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:01.200
- You understand?! I have no

01:32:01.212 --> 01:32:02.212
idea where sh... - Dad!

01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:08.481
Alexis's phone is gone.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.984
What do you mean, honey?
What do you mean?

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:13.820
How... how would she
have found her phone?

01:32:14.029 --> 01:32:16.448
Listen, honey, serious
business time, okay?

01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:19.159
Look at me, I'm not asking you
to rat anybody out, all right?

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.411
Now's not the time to hold back.
Look at me.

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:22.746
Where's your sister?

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.918
I told her where it was. I was
sick of her using my iPad.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.337
She kept using it to
text Oscar and to check

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:33.506
on his lnstagram
and Facebook page.

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.759
L'm sorry, but it was
just really annoying.

01:32:35.967 --> 01:32:37.260
Are you mad?

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.804
No, no, honey, no,
I'm not mad at all.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.599
Did you try to call her?

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:45.393
Yeah, but she won't pick up
or return any of my texts.

01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:49.064
- So your friends will trace the phone...
- I'm doing it, Tiff.

01:32:49.272 --> 01:32:52.317
I think I already
know where she is.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:53.985
What do you mean, honey?

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:56.696
I just typed in Alexis's
ID and passcode

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:58.990
into Find My Phone, and, boom.

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:01.534
There she was.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:07.373
- Oh, shit, she's in New York.
- Let's go.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:11.211
All right, you need anything...
let me know, all right.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:13.004
Call me if you hear
anything, okay?

01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:14.798
- I will you.
- Thank you. Shall we?

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:38.696
Okay, head to the city.
375 Greenwich.

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.240
Okay, got it.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:56.816
Wait, wait, wait,
you're gonna break in?

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.092
I need you to stay down
here and be lookout.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.137
- Okay, yeah.
- If anybody comes, you just whistle.

01:34:02.345 --> 01:34:05.348
- No, wait, I don't whistle.
- I don't...

01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:08.017
- Who the hell can't whistle?
- I don't know how to whistle.

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:09.811
Okay, fine, can you
stand down here

01:34:10.019 --> 01:34:11.699
and just scream real
loud if someone comes?

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.607
What I can do is I can punch
in the face really hard.

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.568
Okay, you can't whistle.

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.570
You can't drive. I'll
have to teach you.

01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:21.156
- Luckily, I'm a quick learner.
- All right, just shh.

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:25.743
Hey, hey, just be careful.

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:27.120
- Shh!
- Okay, God.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:03.364
Oscar! What the...

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:05.825
That's not my daughter.
Who is that?

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:07.794
That's not my daughter.
Where is my daughter?

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:11.748
- Please, Mr. Maxwell...
- Where is Alexis?

01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:14.584
Where is she?! Where is Alex... I
will rip that thing off of you

01:35:14.792 --> 01:35:16.152
and beat you over
the head with it!

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:17.646
Get the fuck out or I'm
calling the police!

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.505
Calm down. You're
not my concern.

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.341
Where's Alexis? I
know she was here.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.360
- Where is she?
- She showed up out of nowhere.

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.220
I swear, I had no
idea she was coming.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:28.097
And what happened? Spit
it out, motherfucker!

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.346
- What happened?!
- She got upset when she found out

01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:32.101
I had a new little
girly, that's it!

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:34.812
Oh, my God, you're a moron.
Where did she go?

01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:36.781
- Hey, where did she go?
- I don't know, man!

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:38.459
She whipped her phone
at me and took off!

01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:39.943
Do you have any
idea where she is?

01:35:40.151 --> 01:35:41.778
I need to know now.
Do you understand?

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:44.197
- Where did she go?!
- No, man, I don't, I swear.

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.324
Okay, here.

01:35:46.532 --> 01:35:49.160
Take it. I'm really sorry, yo.

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:51.871
Look, I never meant
to hurt her feelings.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.250
But she moved away, you know?
Man's got his needs.

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:58.878
Man? Man? You are
not a man, okay?

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:01.214
Let's make something clear here.
You're a child.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.258
Let me tell you something, okay?

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:06.678
You don't deserve one ounce
of her precious heart,

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:09.681
not one ounce of her
precious heart!

01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:12.141
But you know what?
You know what?

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.978
You did her a favor. Actually,
you did me a favor.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:16.521
So I should thank you.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:19.232
Really, from the bottom
of my heart, thank you.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.402
- No doubt.
- You're an idiot. You are an idiot.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.445
Let me give you a piece
of advice, okay?

01:36:24.654 --> 01:36:26.781
Put a condom on that thing
because the last thing

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:29.784
this world needs is another one of
your moronic asses walking around.

01:36:29.993 --> 01:36:32.370
Get your hand out of my
face, outta my face!

01:36:32.537 --> 01:36:35.290
How old are you?
How old are you?

01:36:35.498 --> 01:36:37.959
- Why the fuck do you...
- Do yourself a favor.

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.795
Run, do not walk away
from this prick.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:43.131
Hey, get out of here with that, man.
What?

01:36:43.339 --> 01:36:46.342
Get... leave. What are you doing?
Get out.

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:50.513
You broke into my house.
Front door is that way.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:52.682
Thank you, that's another
favor you just did me!

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:55.560
- I would've gone down the fire escape!
- No doubt.

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:59.772
- Fuck was that?!
- How old are you?

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.488
Okay, call me if you hear
anything, okay? Yeah.

01:37:07.697 --> 01:37:10.491
- Anything?
- Nothing. She hasn't called home.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.261
None of her friends
have heard from her.

01:37:12.285 --> 01:37:13.661
Well, at least we
know she's here.

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:15.330
Here could be anywhere.

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.417
L'm a complete
failure as a parent.

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:21.586
That is complete and
utter bullshit.

01:37:21.794 --> 01:37:24.964
Everything I did is wrong.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:27.175
You love those girls,
and they love you.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.052
You're doing the best you can.

01:37:29.218 --> 01:37:33.389
Come on, that's just it.
None of it is good enough.

01:37:33.598 --> 01:37:35.099
Look at this situation we're in.

01:37:35.308 --> 01:37:36.988
This is because of my
mistakes as a parent.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.686
It's not her fault.

01:37:38.895 --> 01:37:41.564
- Nobody's perfect.
- Nobody's perfect?

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.399
Yeah, kids fuck up.
Parents fuck up.

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:45.276
- We all fuck up.
- Come on, Bridget.

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:47.362
My 16-year-old is out
here roaming the streets

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.072
with no money, she's
got no phone...

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:51.991
- James? James? James!
- God knows where she could be!

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.828
All right, listen, I'm gonna use
my teacher voice right now.

01:37:56.037 --> 01:37:57.789
Shut the fuck up and think.

01:38:00.249 --> 01:38:02.126
Where would she go?

01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:04.670
Where is the one
place in this world

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:06.339
she would feel completely safe?

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:15.556
That's one key, that's
two keys, that's...

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.354
Come here.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:24.023
Always the last place
you look, right?

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:25.400
You're a genius.

01:38:37.286 --> 01:38:40.498
You go ahead. I'll wait here.

01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:41.749
Okay.

01:39:00.476 --> 01:39:01.477
Mouse?

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:07.732
Mouse?

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:17.869
Mouse...

01:39:22.248 --> 01:39:24.834
Mouse.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.259
I was looking all over for you.

01:39:34.844 --> 01:39:38.598
You had us all worried
to death, you know.

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.558
Uncle Lou put an APB out on you.

01:39:40.766 --> 01:39:44.479
Awareness, performance, bravado?

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:46.981
No.

01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:48.232
A real one.

01:39:48.441 --> 01:39:50.693
Are you mad at me?

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.487
No.

01:39:52.695 --> 01:39:54.405
I mean, honestly, I didn't think

01:39:54.614 --> 01:39:56.908
I could be angrier at
another human being,

01:39:57.116 --> 01:39:59.994
but seeing you sitting
here like this,

01:40:00.203 --> 01:40:02.914
nothing makes me happier, okay?
Nothing.

01:40:03.122 --> 01:40:05.416
You're just saying that
to get me to leave.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:08.044
No, are you kidding?

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:10.671
Honey, honey, honey, do
you know what I would do

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.423
if something happened to you?

01:40:12.632 --> 01:40:14.467
Huh?

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:16.761
Promise?

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.392
Yeah, I promise.
Yeah, I promise.

01:40:25.895 --> 01:40:28.981
This place is the only
connection I have left to them.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:35.530
L'm sorry I wasn't conscious
of that till now.

01:40:35.738 --> 01:40:39.825
It's like I can hardly even
remember them anymore.

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:44.664
The more and more time goes
by, the more I forget.

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:48.543
- And the less that I miss them.
- No, listen, sweetheart...

01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:53.089
And it makes me feel like the most
terrible person in the world.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:55.550
No, sweetheart, sweetheart,
sweetheart, listen,

01:40:55.758 --> 01:40:59.595
listen to me, you are
not a terrible person.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:00.805
No, listen.

01:41:05.601 --> 01:41:07.645
Forgive me for
saying this, okay?

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.231
But you are just a
heartbroken little girl.

01:41:10.439 --> 01:41:13.067
No, you are, you have the weight
of the world on your shoulders,

01:41:13.276 --> 01:41:16.737
and that's what it is
to be a young person.

01:41:16.946 --> 01:41:18.739
It's okay. lt's okay.

01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:24.370
There is a part of your parents
in you and your sister,

01:41:24.579 --> 01:41:28.666
and I see it in you
guys every single day.

01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:31.544
That's never gonna change.

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:34.005
Lam not gonna let
you forget them.

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:44.932
You are hardheaded just like
your father, you know that?

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:46.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:49.645
Two of the most stubborn people
I've ever met in my life.

01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:56.027
But you're also two
of my favorites.

01:41:56.193 --> 01:41:57.753
L'm sorry I've been
such a bitch to you.

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.238
It's okay.

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:00.906
You didn't deserve any of it.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:04.493
It's... it's part of the job.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.330
It's what I signed up for.

01:42:07.538 --> 01:42:10.291
I remember that day.

01:42:10.499 --> 01:42:12.627
<i>What</i> day?

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:17.298
<i>Outside the office. I heard you.</i>

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:19.967
<i>You didn't have to take us.
You chose to.</i>

01:42:20.176 --> 01:42:25.890
Oh, <i>well,</i> nah, <i>I</i> like to
<i>think</i> about it that...

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:27.808
<i>that we chose each
other, you know?</i>

01:42:29.852 --> 01:42:33.898
<i>Things happen for a reason.
All right.</i>

01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:40.613
I love you, James.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:44.075
I love you too, mouse. So much.

01:42:53.125 --> 01:42:55.711
I don't like it here.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.255
Come again?

01:42:58.464 --> 01:43:00.007
- The city's not...
- No, I heard you.

01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:01.634
- I heard what you said.
- Yeah.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.303
I just want to hear you say it again.
Say it again.

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:07.223
The city's not the
same anymore, okay?

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:10.351
Wow. How the mighty have fallen.

01:43:12.895 --> 01:43:14.563
I don't like it here either.

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.649
- Really?
- No.

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:19.110
It's not the same for me either.

01:43:21.654 --> 01:43:22.654
Want to go home?

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:26.200
Where's home?

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.121
Buffalo?

01:43:30.329 --> 01:43:31.914
Sounds weird to say
that, doesn't it?

01:43:32.123 --> 01:43:34.792
I guess it feels better
than being here.

01:43:37.837 --> 01:43:40.923
Let me ask you a
question, though.

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:45.928
How the hell did you get here?
How did you get here?

01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:51.934
Well... I may or may not
have used your credit card.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:55.146
Oh. Smart. Smart person.

01:43:55.354 --> 01:43:57.231
That's you. That's you and me.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.108
Is it?

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.193
You're still a grounded person.

01:44:01.402 --> 01:44:03.237
That's fine, I don't
even have a phone.

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:06.824
- I threw it at Oscar.
- I know, I saw Oscar.

01:44:07.032 --> 01:44:09.034
We can talk about it on
the way home, let's go.

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:11.287
- Uh...
- Let's go.

01:44:55.664 --> 01:44:56.749
What happened?

01:44:56.957 --> 01:44:58.751
Oh, she's good.

01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:02.755
Gracie, do you want to tell him
or do you want me to tell him?

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:05.132
Okay. She got her period.

01:45:05.341 --> 01:45:09.637
Oh. okay. Uh... what do I do?

01:45:09.845 --> 01:45:12.348
Do I need a cake, balloons?
Ls there a party?

01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:14.975
- We got it under control.
- No cake.

01:45:15.184 --> 01:45:18.020
Well, this might make
you feel better.

01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:33.661
Dad. For real?

01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:36.539
Yeah. For real.
