the moment he gets home.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.026
- Are you kidding me?
How exciting is that?

07:42.157 --> 07:44.028
That means he actually met
somebody new.

07:44.159 --> 07:46.857
- I know. I know.
A new love for our boy.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.294
I never thought
I'd see the day.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.253
- Thank you so much, buddy.
I appreciate that.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.168
- You got it.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.952
- Yo, Pags, we're not late,
are we?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.519
- No, no. You're fine.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.260
But the show might not even
fucking happen, okay?

07:58.390 --> 08:00.305
- What? Why?
- Dude, the drummer's MIA,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.351
and we can't find someone
to replace her,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.048
and they're supposed to go on
in ten fucking minutes.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.268
And I--I honestly feel like I'm
about to fucking cry right now.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.704
- What, they can't go on
without a drummer?

08:07.835 --> 08:09.706
- Yeah, why don't you just do
an acoustic set or something?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.012
- Yeah, come on.
- No, they can't go on

08:11.142 --> 08:12.230
without a drummer!

08:12.361 --> 08:13.275
They're not fucking
Simon and Garfunkel

08:13.405 --> 08:14.842
playing two-part fucking
harmonies.

08:14.972 --> 08:16.104
They're a punk rock band.
You can't be a punk rock band

08:16.234 --> 08:17.148
without any fucking drums!

08:17.279 --> 08:19.150
- Pags...
- I'm sorry.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.239
I'm all wound up.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.632
[sighs] I've been trying
to get them in here

08:22.763 --> 08:25.940
for fucking months,
and tonight, the drummer quits?

08:26.070 --> 08:28.769
And, on top of everything else,
my fucking mother is in there

08:28.899 --> 08:31.075
wearing skin-tight leather
fucking pants.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.034
- Hey, look at you.
- What's happening?

08:33.164 --> 08:35.253
- I don't know.
Hey, how are you?

08:35.384 --> 08:37.125
- I just spoke to the girls.
What the hell are we gonna do?

08:37.255 --> 08:38.779
- I have no fucking idea.

08:38.909 --> 08:42.217
- Yo, I have a solution
for you.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.785
Why don't you ask Tammy
to fill in?

08:44.915 --> 08:46.177
I mean, you remember, dude.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.265
She was a part of
the high school drum line.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.050
- Ha ha. Not funny.
- Come on.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.095
- Don't do this.
- T-t-t-that's true.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.270
You were in band
in high school, Tammy.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.316
Can you fill in?
- No. Absolutely not.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.318
No. Okay, that was
so many years ago,

08:56.448 --> 08:58.146
and I'm not even
a real drummer.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.669
- Come on, Tammy, you know
that you can still play.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.801
Dude, you remember.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.367
She was badass
behind those drums.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.195
- Yes! Yeah, yeah.
You did Battle of the Bands

09:04.326 --> 09:06.023
with Dustin and Adam
from Foreplay.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.068
- Tammy, is this true?

09:07.198 --> 09:08.765
- No.
- Yes. Yes.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.027
- Kind of. Kind of. No.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.812
I--I can play a little bit,

09:11.942 --> 09:13.727
but not in front
of a huge crowd like that.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.119
And I was never badass.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.338
- Okay. When was the last time
you played?

09:16.468 --> 09:18.166
- I don't know.
Like, a couple years ago.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.037
- Oh, Tammy, it's like riding
a bike.

09:20.168 --> 09:21.212
I know you got this.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.214
- Look, it's settled.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.738
You're playing, okay?
- No, Pags.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.783
I'm not going anywhere. No.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.569
Thank you, Mikey.
- Tammy, we really need you.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.137
- Fuck! Yeah.
- [screams]

09:33.268 --> 09:34.356
- Okay. I'll do it. Yeah.
- [laughs]

09:34.486 --> 09:36.227
- Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.360
- Let's go!
Let's rock and roll, baby!

09:38.490 --> 09:40.101
[all speaking at once]
- She's on the bill.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.363
She's on the bill!

09:41.493 --> 09:43.365
- Are you fucking
shitting me?

09:43.495 --> 09:45.323
Tammy?
You want Tammy to play drums?

09:45.454 --> 09:46.803
- She was in band
in high school.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.152
She was on the drum line.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.371
What other choice do we have?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.286
- Go out there and pull
the fucking fire alarm.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.331
- That is not a fucking option.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.203
If you guys do not go out
and play tonight,

09:55.333 --> 09:57.205
you will never get
invited back.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.772
Not to mention my fucking ass
is on the line.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.905
So I highly suggest for you
guys to try and play with her,

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
or you may never have
another shot.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.867
- What do you think?

10:06.997 --> 10:09.434
- I think we should do it.
I think they're right.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.045
- What if we go out there
and take a big fucking

10:11.175 --> 10:13.177
giant shit on stage?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.614
- Please tell me
you're fucking kidding.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.267
- I didn't mean literally.
- Okay, Lizzie,

10:16.398 --> 10:18.313
no one has ever said that they
loved one of our shows

10:18.443 --> 10:20.402
because of
the drumming, right?

10:20.532 --> 10:22.970
They love you.
They fucking love you.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.494
You're incredible, so you
just go out there, and you--

10:25.625 --> 10:28.236
you do what you do, yeah?

10:28.366 --> 10:30.325
- All right,
let's fucking do it.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.196
- Yeah.
- Hallelujah.

10:32.327 --> 10:33.415
- Okay, go get her.
Go get Tammy.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.939
- Someone wake her ass up.
- Kay.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.030
- What she said.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.860
- Hey, Sarah.
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.122
Time to go.
- [whistles]

10:45.253 --> 10:46.297
- Let's rock and roll.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.648
Aww, there she is.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.129
- Kitty!

10:52.260 --> 10:54.175
Kitty, he's home!

10:56.351 --> 10:59.136
There he is. There he is.

11:01.356 --> 11:03.314
- Hey, Dad.
- Jesus Christ, look at you.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.840
Oh, my God.
It's been a long year.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.406
It's been a long year, James.

11:08.537 --> 11:09.930
- How you doing, Dad?
How you doing?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.888
- Better now.
So much better now.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.021
- Arthur, let him go.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.849
- What?
I'm sorry, all right?

11:15.979 --> 11:17.938
I missed him.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.287
- I missed you too.
- Go.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.331
Give your mother a hug
and kiss, all right?

11:20.462 --> 11:22.246
I'll get your bag.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.813
- Oh, my God, James.
I missed you so much.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.336
- I missed you, Ma.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.817
Oh, my God.
Man, I missed this place too.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.210
Feels good to be back.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.515
- Well, wait
till tomorrow night.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.865
We got a whole little
welcome-home party

11:31.995 --> 11:33.257
planned for you.

11:33.388 --> 11:34.345
Your mother and I
reached out to everybody,

11:34.476 --> 11:35.346
and the whole gang
is gonna be here.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.697
- "Your mother and I."
No, I reached out.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.350
Your father bought
the steaks and the burgers.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.483
- And the beer, of course.
- Really?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.267
So, uh, who exactly
did you invite?

11:43.398 --> 11:44.878
- Don't worry,
I called Jill too.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.401
- And she's gonna come?

11:46.531 --> 11:47.837
- She said she and Stacey'll
both be here.

11:47.968 --> 11:48.969
That's all right, huh?

11:49.099 --> 11:51.362
- [chuckles]
That's--that's great.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.017
- So Hank, did Jill tell you
we have a big party

11:54.148 --> 11:56.106
to go to tomorrow afternoon?

11:56.237 --> 11:57.934
- I've asked you several times
tonight not to call me that.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.327
My name's Henry, not Hank.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.722
- Did I say Hank again?
I meant Henry.

12:02.852 --> 12:04.332
- Oh, this one's
just delightful, isn't she?

12:04.462 --> 12:05.333
- Yeah.
- So what's this I hear

12:05.463 --> 12:07.030
about a party,
and I'm not invited?

12:07.161 --> 12:09.511
- Okay, first of all,
it's not a "big party."

12:09.641 --> 12:10.642
Thank you.

12:10.773 --> 12:13.297
It's a barbecue
out in Long Island

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
with our old friends.
You do not want to go.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.040
- And why would you assume
I wouldn't want to go?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.912
Don't you think I'd get on with
your bridge and tunnel friends?

12:19.042 --> 12:20.391
- Mm, definitely not.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.263
- It's my ex-boyfriend's
welcome-home dinner.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.265
- Yeah, of course.
The photographer.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.701
- Don't tell me
you're jealous.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.268
- I made the mistake
of telling him all about Jimmy.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.486
- And all about
their sexual exploits.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.793
- 'Cause you asked.
- Regrettably.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.708
- Yeah. Now he seems to think
that if Jimmy and I

12:32.839 --> 12:33.970
are in the same room
as one another,

12:34.101 --> 12:35.755
we're gonna jump right back
into each other's arms.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.495
- It's the jumping into bed
that concerns me more.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.888
- Well, then don't give me
a reason to.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.411
- Oh, I won't.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.066
- So you are jealous.
I love it.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.416
- No, that's not jealousy.
That's my being territorial.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.592
I just don't want anybody else
going near my girl.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.508
- Wow. Your girl, huh?
Wait, I'm confused.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.554
Haven't you guys just known
each other a couple weeks?

12:52.684 --> 12:54.251
- What can I say?
This rapturous young lady

12:54.382 --> 12:56.123
has captured my heart.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.342
- Yeah, I'm a rapturous
young lady. What can he do?

12:58.473 --> 13:00.649
- Wow. That's so wonderful
for you two,

13:00.780 --> 13:04.131
But hey, Hanky-panky, let's go
back to the barbecue.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.742
Now, you're not so territorial
that you'd be upset

13:06.873 --> 13:08.396
if Jill went to Jimmy's party,
are you?

13:10.224 --> 13:11.616
- Well, answer her.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.923
- In my defense, this is
the first I'm hearing of it.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.969
- So what do you think?

13:16.099 --> 13:18.972
Should she go...or not?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.364
- To be perfectly honest, no.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.452
I don't think I like the idea
very much at all.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.151
- Oh, baby.
- What?

13:24.281 --> 13:26.631
- Why not?
What are you scared of?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.329
- Really? You know what?

13:28.459 --> 13:30.331
I'm so sorry I even
brought it up.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.507
Let's change the subject, huh?

13:32.637 --> 13:35.031
- Hey, Jules. This is
Lisa Bishop from Atlantic.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.512
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for coming.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.688
Of course, I didn't think you
were gonna come at all.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.038
- Well, you hyped them up.
What was I gonna do, not show?

13:42.169 --> 13:44.388
- This is fucking awesome.
Thank you so much.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.304
Enjoy the show, ladies.
Cheers.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.610
- [exhales]
- Holy shit.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.351
You're not gonna believe
who's here tonight.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.396
Lisa Bishop
from Atlantic Records.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.529
- What the fuck?
What is she doing here?

13:54.659 --> 13:57.053
- I might have invited her,
but I had no idea

13:57.184 --> 13:58.402
she was actually gonna show up.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.535
- Oh. Mm.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.450
I love you.
- I love you.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.974
- [laughs]
[microphone feedback]

14:05.105 --> 14:06.497
Thank you!

14:06.628 --> 14:07.977
[glasses clink]

14:08.108 --> 14:09.457
Oh, shit.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.589
Tammy better be able
to pull this off.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.419
- First of all, thank you
for being such a terrific son

14:15.550 --> 14:17.160
who kept his promise
and wrote all the time.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.423
- What can I say, Dad?
I'm a man of my word.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.122
- Your father read each one
about a dozen times.

14:22.252 --> 14:23.950
- And these? I mean,
the Polaroids were also

14:24.080 --> 14:25.603
just terrific.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.431
You know, they really gave us
a sense of where you were.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.042
I mean, look at that.
How great is that?

14:29.172 --> 14:31.174
- That was in the Andes.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.046
Took us over a month
to find the pumas

14:33.176 --> 14:34.090
Mr. Ford was looking to shoot.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.570
- And how about this beauty?

14:35.700 --> 14:37.485
How long did it take you
to find her?

14:37.615 --> 14:39.182
- Ah.

14:39.313 --> 14:40.401
- Yeah, your mother and I
were speculating

14:40.531 --> 14:42.490
maybe something might have
been going on there, huh?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.492
- Yeah, it might have been.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.103
- That Maya by chance?
- Yeah.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.539
- How do you know her name?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.324
- She called here, what,
about a half hour

14:50.454 --> 14:51.455
before you got home?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.501
- What?
What did she say?

14:53.631 --> 14:55.416
