And wastin' all my time

01:05.791 --> 01:09.750
When you're standin'
Oh so near

01:11.875 --> 01:14.916
I kind of lose my mind

01:17.041 --> 01:19.958
It's not the perfume that you wear

01:21.708 --> 01:25.083
It's not the ribbons in your hair

01:26.458 --> 01:29.458
I don't mind you comin' here

01:31.125 --> 01:35.666

02:05.875 --> 02:09.666
'Cause when you're standin' oh so near

02:09.750 --> 02:12.250
I kinda lose my mind

02:13.750 --> 02:17.250
It's not the perfume that you wear

(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

02:58.708 --> 03:01.041
So, Mom, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.875
Okay.

03:04.291 --> 03:07.125
I guess I didn't think
we'd be moving again so quickly.

03:08.666 --> 03:12.750
Like, we were in Mica for so long
and I feel like,

03:13.583 --> 03:16.291
just as I started making friends, we left.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.125
That's not exactly what happened, I got...

03:18.208 --> 03:22.791
I know that's not why we left,
but is this gonna be a thing now?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.500
Just going from place to place?

03:26.458 --> 03:31.458
Cinnamon is the oldest friend I have, Mom.
That's not normal.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.500
No offense, Bun-Bun.

03:36.333 --> 03:39.666
I didn't know you felt that way.
I thought you liked going on adventures.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.166
Going on adventures is one thing,

03:41.250 --> 03:44.166
but having your whole life
be an adventure is another.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.166
But life is an adventure.

03:46.250 --> 03:51.125
I wanna know people,
like, really know people.

03:52.375 --> 03:54.875
And then maybe go on some adventures.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.875
And I'm so happy that you're
making your dreams come true.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.208
-I am, really. And...
-I don't know if this is about my dreams.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.958
Maybe it is. It's mostly about
taking care of you and us.

04:08.666 --> 04:12.625
This job is more money than
I will ever have made doing what I do.

04:14.041 --> 04:17.583
But what if I make you a promise?

04:19.666 --> 04:25.000
What if I promise that you will
finish your senior year here?

04:26.125 --> 04:27.958
I mean, look at this.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.875
California is pretty cool.

04:31.791 --> 04:34.458
You're gonna have so much fun exploring.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.375
Maybe you'll get a job,

04:37.291 --> 04:39.208
make some new friends
that aren't your pet rat.

-we're right there.

06:03.291 --> 06:04.541

06:05.250 --> 06:07.541
there's an older gentleman
below you in one.

06:07.625 --> 06:12.208
You probably won't see him much,
but he can be kind of grumpy.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.000
-(CHUCKLES)
-So, you said you're here for work?

06:15.541 --> 06:17.750
Oh, yeah, my big break.

06:18.166 --> 06:20.333
Congrats! So you're an actress?

06:20.416 --> 06:22.083
Oh, God, no.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.083
No, no, I do costumes

06:24.291 --> 06:26.708
-Ah!
-For theater for the last forever years,

06:26.958 --> 06:28.416
but I'm here to do a movie.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.208
The costume designer quit
and I'm taking over.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.166

06:33.791 --> 06:35.958
-They're trying to make one, actually.
-ANA: Oh!

06:36.208 --> 06:37.375
How old are your kids?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.750
My youngest, Evan, is about your age.

06:39.875 --> 06:42.166
Oh, and, uh, my oldest is grown and gone.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.291
Um, except when he's hungry,

06:44.375 --> 06:46.083
so I guess he's never really gone,

06:46.166 --> 06:47.916
-'cause he's always hungry.

And I don't know what to say

08:52.083 --> 08:54.000
-I took the bus.
-Hi, Bun-Bun... What?

08:54.416 --> 08:57.500
Why didn't you tell me
how amazing the bus is?

08:57.583 --> 09:01.833
I know, the bus is great, but I kind of...
This isn't exactly the best time 'cause...

-Yeah, this is Cinnamon. Do you wanna--

-What?

-Your mom, she said something like...
-What's going on out here, Evan?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.708
I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell. Sorry.

12:38.416 --> 12:39.958
Well, just text her.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.291
-I don't have her number.
-I don't have a phone.

13:39.208 --> 13:40.458
(PLAYS KAZOO)

13:41.166 --> 13:42.208
All right.

13:42.291 --> 13:46.458
Anyway, our movie, my brother Terrell,
he's gonna direct it and I wrote it.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.166
We emailed our script
to a bunch of producers,

13:49.250 --> 13:50.750
but no one seemed interested,

13:50.833 --> 13:52.875
so Terrell read up on
a couple of film blogs that

13:53.375 --> 13:56.583
if you're new or you want to get noticed,
you gotta make a sizzle reel.

13:57.041 --> 13:58.208
A what?

13:58.291 --> 14:02.000
Oh, it's like a little movie
or a part of a movie,

14:02.083 --> 14:04.916
or just something to show
what your big movie will be like.

14:05.041 --> 14:07.291
-Okay.
-And I'm gonna be in it,

14:07.791 --> 14:09.125
but we need a girl for it.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.125
And you could be the perfect girl.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.208
-Um.
-What?

14:16.291 --> 14:20.625
I just... I've never acted before.

14:20.708 --> 14:23.250
-But you sing. You sing, right?
-That's true.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.208
So do you write your own stuff?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.458
-Just covers.
-Okay, okay.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.416
We want original songs for the movie,

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
but we'll probably do
a cover for the sizzle.

14:32.625 --> 14:33.708
-Okay.
-Yeah.

14:34.916 --> 14:38.083
So, uh, what's the movie about?

14:39.291 --> 14:43.291
Oh, it's about this guy,
he's about to graduate high school,

14:43.500 --> 14:45.875
and he's not sure what he wants
to do with his life yet,

14:45.958 --> 14:49.375
and he tries a bunch of different things,
but nothing seems to stick.

14:50.291 --> 14:52.000
And just when he's about to lose hope,

14:52.083 --> 14:54.666
he goes to this party
that he almost didn't go to,

14:55.708 --> 14:56.875
and he meets this girl.

14:58.666 --> 15:02.000
And getting to know her
helps him figure things out.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.166
Oh...

15:04.250 --> 15:05.375
So...

15:05.916 --> 15:09.000
She's only in the story to help him?

15:09.083 --> 15:12.000
Oh, no. No, no. No.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.375
Sorry. No, she's not.
She's her own person, definitely.

15:15.791 --> 15:19.958
Just getting to know her helps him realize
that he has to figure it out on his own.

15:20.041 --> 15:23.250
She doesn't, like, figure it out for him.
She got her own story to tell.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.458
And it's in the end, the last scene,
the big musical number on the beach,

15:27.541 --> 15:30.625
where he realizes all of this,
that he'd been trying to be the person

15:30.708 --> 15:32.375
that he thought she wanted him to be.

15:32.791 --> 15:33.958
And they sing,

15:35.791 --> 15:37.791
-they dance.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

15:39.500 --> 15:40.750
And then she leaves.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.083
Uh, what's it called?

15:47.416 --> 15:48.416
Tell Your Story.

15:48.750 --> 15:51.458
-What?
-The title is Tell Your Story.

15:51.541 --> 15:53.083
-The title is Tell Your Story. Um...
-Yeah.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.500
Right, that's cool, I like it.
I like it, that's cool.

15:57.666 --> 16:01.833
So my brother works at this club, Forte.

16:01.958 --> 16:05.666
They have a bar, but, you know,
sometimes they let me in through the back.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.791
They have great music, and on Wednesdays,
they have open mic,

16:08.875 --> 16:10.041
so it's a little more lax.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.000
You should come meet him.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
Like, hang out?

16:15.875 --> 16:18.333
Yeah. Like, hang out.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.791
Okay, okay.

16:28.291 --> 16:33.125
Okay, I'm putting some
extra cash on that thing.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.250
Thank you.

16:34.958 --> 16:38.125
Oh, and I put my school forms there.

16:38.541 --> 16:41.541
Oh, great. I will take those with me
and fill them out at work.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.291
I think I made a friend.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.333
That's great.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.666
-Are you okay?
-(CLEARS THROAT)

16:51.000 --> 16:55.083

(CELL PHONE RINGING A COMICAL TUNE)

17:01.125 --> 17:02.208
Oh.

17:02.958 --> 17:04.125
Who was that?

17:04.208 --> 17:06.333
The theater company
in Berkeley keeps calling

17:06.458 --> 17:08.583
even though I told them I'm unavailable.

17:08.916 --> 17:12.791
Anyway, now I know why the other designer
quit and how they wound up with me.

17:13.916 --> 17:14.916
I'm sorry.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.791
It's still a great opportunity.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.458
(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION) Quit calling me!

17:21.541 --> 17:23.750
Maybe you should pick up
and tell them that.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.333
Trust me, I have.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.250
So why do they keep calling you?

17:27.333 --> 17:30.291
I'm probably making a bigger deal
about this than I need to,

17:30.375 --> 17:31.791
but thank you for listening.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.541
Wait, you were telling me something.
Shoot, what? I...

17:34.666 --> 17:36.333
It's fine. It's nothing.

17:36.416 --> 17:38.625
This weekend, I promise,
we'll go to the flea market

17:38.708 --> 17:41.541
and we'll get some stuff
to make it feel more like a home here.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.125
Oh, and the production people,

17:43.333 --> 17:45.916
they told me that the boxes we shipped
are gonna be here soon.

17:46.041 --> 17:47.166
(BOTH SOFTLY) Yay!

17:47.625 --> 17:51.291

17:55.625 --> 17:57.208
-Bye, honey. Bye.
-Bye.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.208
-Mom, those...
-Yes!

18:01.291 --> 18:05.125
Those are coming with me
and I'm filling them out at work.

18:05.750 --> 18:06.791
Bye.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.625
Can I help you?

18:23.708 --> 18:25.708
I walked all the way from the Gelson's.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.041
Do you think I need help
from here to my door?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.375
Sorry.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.541
-Well, can I walk with you?
-From here to there?

18:33.333 --> 18:34.416
Yeah.

18:35.708 --> 18:38.125
Well, looks like we're gonna make it.

(GRUNTS)

18:40.166 --> 18:42.375
Thank God! We made it.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.541
Is there really nothing I can do to help?

18:47.208 --> 18:49.583
If you kept the music down,
that would be nice.

18:50.625 --> 18:55.375
I'm so sorry. I really didn't realize
I was making so much noise.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.666
Any noise is too much noise.

19:04.458 --> 19:07.208
Hey, I noticed you were
Googling about finding a job.

19:07.291 --> 19:08.791
Do you need my help with that?

19:09.291 --> 19:15.000
No, I'm just trying to figure out
what I wanna do this summer.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.708
Yeah. But I'll let you know.

19:18.166 --> 19:21.666
Okay, 'cause I didn't mean you
had to get a job. It was just an idea.

19:21.750 --> 19:26.041
I just thought maybe it might be
a good way for you... What?

19:30.041 --> 19:31.958
-It's summer.
-I know.

you gotta do it all the way.

-Roxanne Martel. She's a musi--
-Hey.

Who exactly are you, again?

31:28.958 --> 31:32.291

31:53.458 --> 31:55.333
We can get started
with rehearsing the sizzle.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.750
I still don't totally understand
what that is.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.458
You will. Mostly we need to figure out

31:59.541 --> 32:01.708
what song we'll use
so we can start rehearsing.

32:01.791 --> 32:04.583
We need something that feels right
and isn't overplayed.

32:05.750 --> 32:09.041
I can't believe Roxanne Martel
heard me sing.

32:10.666 --> 32:12.041
Do you wanna get ice cream?

32:12.666 --> 32:19.125
Love and mercy
That's what you need tonight

32:20.875 --> 32:23.375
So, love and mercy

32:23.458 --> 32:28.666
To you and your friends tonight

32:30.958 --> 32:37.833
Love and mercy
That's what you need tonight

32:38.041 --> 32:42.875
Love and mercy tonight

32:52.250 --> 32:53.666
What is she reading?

32:54.208 --> 32:57.333
A script a boy gave her.
They're gonna make a movie.

32:57.416 --> 33:00.416
We're making a sizzle reel,
not a movie, Mom.

33:00.833 --> 33:02.875
-Oh!
-Ow! Oh, my God!

33:02.958 --> 33:04.583
-Oh, my God. So sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

33:04.666 --> 33:06.333
-No, it's okay.
-What is it? What?

33:06.416 --> 33:11.541
It's just so good. It is so good.
Oh, my gosh, and I know the perfect song.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.208
Oh, my gosh, I need my boxes.
Mom, do you...

33:14.291 --> 33:15.583
Tomorrow morning.

33:15.666 --> 33:18.166
Okay. Um, I'm gonna go.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.291
Okay.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.041
-And Mom?
-Hmm.

33:24.166 --> 33:25.458
I love LA.

33:57.583 --> 34:00.083
He said he doesn't know
if the player works.

34:00.833 --> 34:02.125
Why don't you look on my phone?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.208
I tried to find it,
but I can't find it anywhere.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.333
There you go.

34:05.416 --> 34:08.000
All I have is this tape
that my mom gave me.

34:08.083 --> 34:11.916
I just... I can't believe that Roxanne
was there the other night.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.875
That's so crazy.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.375
She's there every night.

34:15.458 --> 34:18.125
And, you know, I always wondered
what happened to her.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.791
She put out one album
and then just... Nothing.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.416
Like, how do you even do that?

34:22.500 --> 34:26.208
How do you make something
so good and then just stop?

34:26.291 --> 34:28.250
-Hey.
-There he is.

34:30.125 --> 34:31.583
This better be good.

34:32.916 --> 34:34.750
TERRELL: All right,
I'm only on break for 20,

34:34.833 --> 34:37.458
so we have to drive and listen.
I can't drive anywhere else.

34:37.541 --> 34:38.791
Cool?

34:38.875 --> 34:39.875
Yeah, that's cool.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.375
Cool.

34:49.750 --> 34:50.916
I feel like it's not...

35:00.166 --> 35:01.458
Oh... Right. Got it.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

35:15.875 --> 35:18.625
Coming through the canyon

35:18.708 --> 35:20.458
This is table six?

35:20.583 --> 35:22.291
'Cause I took the 405

35:22.375 --> 35:23.375
No way.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.458
No way.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.916
She's so good, right?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.333
And to prove that I'm alive

35:31.166 --> 35:32.500
I mean, this is different.

35:32.875 --> 35:34.458
It's good, man. (CHUCKLES)

35:34.541 --> 35:39.000
But I think I'm tired of waitin'
for some moment to arrive

35:39.875 --> 35:45.916
If happy ever after's
just a lucky streak

36:11.250 --> 36:12.958
I thought we were going to Forte.

36:13.041 --> 36:14.541
Terrell has a couple jobs.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.541
It's how we've saved for the sizzle.

36:16.625 --> 36:18.958
He put some of every paycheck
aside for months.

36:19.708 --> 36:23.375
One day I'm gonna own this place.
Gonna own all the places.

36:24.666 --> 36:26.500
-All right, I'll see you, guys.
-Bye.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.125
Wait, but you liked it, though, right?

36:29.208 --> 36:30.750
You'd wanna deal with table six?

36:30.833 --> 36:32.666
Her name is Roxanne Martel.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.250
And you never know
what someone's been through.

36:37.916 --> 36:40.083
It is really cool that it's about LA.

36:41.166 --> 36:43.041
She does come into the club
early to play piano.

36:44.583 --> 36:46.583
And Forte's not far, you guys can walk.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.083
-Call me when you talk to her.
-Oh, I... I don't have a phone.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.583
Wait, what?

36:53.541 --> 36:54.958
Can we have some pizza?

once the doors open.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.166
What are you doing here?

38:50.541 --> 38:53.166
Miracle Mile is a perfect album.

You're messing with me.

Is this you?

39:06.250 --> 39:08.666
Can we have two Shirley Temples, please?

and you were here the other night.

39:21.833 --> 39:23.208
She live in LA in the '90s?

39:25.041 --> 39:26.041
No.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.583
That was the only place you could get it.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Thank you.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.750
I liked your singing.

Thank you.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.125
You write your own stuff?

39:49.208 --> 39:53.791
No. I just really, really
like other people's stuff.

39:54.750 --> 39:55.833
I see.

39:58.166 --> 40:04.583
So, uh, the reason why I came here
to talk with you is that, um,

40:04.666 --> 40:07.333
my friends and I,
we're making this sizzle reel.

40:07.416 --> 40:08.416
A what?

40:08.875 --> 40:12.000
Well, it's for this movie
that we're making,

40:12.083 --> 40:14.250
so we're making, like,
a small version of the movie

40:14.333 --> 40:16.083
to show what the big one will be like,

40:16.166 --> 40:18.041
otherwise people won't give us money
to make it...

40:18.125 --> 40:21.291
(LAUGHING) ...and anyways,
I'm gonna be in it.

40:21.375 --> 40:25.208
And we would love to use Miracle Mile.

40:25.291 --> 40:26.333
No.

40:28.458 --> 40:29.625
But... But we just...

your own thing.

No, that.

-You did?
-Yeah.

That's cool.

The actors do the acting,
writers do the writing and so on.

And the producer makes sure
that everyone has what they need.

43:43.250 --> 43:47.166
And, uh,
if there's any questions or problems,

43:48.333 --> 43:50.666
the producer figures it out.

43:51.500 --> 43:53.250
Sounds like a lot of responsibility.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.333
Yeah, it is.

for the wrong reasons.

even know what the job is.

in what I have to say anymore.

Just 'cause it didn't go the way
you wanted it to,

44:58.750 --> 45:01.083
doesn't mean you shouldn't have done it.

45:20.916 --> 45:24.875

every Friday night to the movies.

45:26.416 --> 45:28.291
Yeah, it didn't matter what was playing,

45:29.041 --> 45:30.625
we wanted to see them all.

45:31.916 --> 45:36.000

made us feel like we could do anything.

45:39.416 --> 45:41.000
unload the groceries?

45:44.916 --> 45:46.958
Yeah, yeah. I see, I see.

45:54.958 --> 45:57.625
What if we did figure it out on our own?

45:58.500 --> 45:59.500
What?

46:00.791 --> 46:02.958
What if we wrote our own song?

46:05.250 --> 46:06.500
We can't write music.

46:06.583 --> 46:07.583
And how do you know?

46:07.666 --> 46:09.208
Well, I've never tried to fly, but...

46:10.041 --> 46:11.791
-You can't fly, Evan.
-(STARGIRL LAUGHS)

46:11.875 --> 46:13.583
Okay, but look, maybe she's right.

46:14.208 --> 46:17.416
We... We know what the song needs to be,
and she sings.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.416
-I play the piano a little bit...
-You can?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.916
Yeah, took some lessons when I was little.

46:22.041 --> 46:23.958
We don't have a piano.

46:25.250 --> 46:29.625
But we know someone who does.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.208
EVAN: Mm.

46:32.333 --> 46:33.750
No, no.

46:33.833 --> 46:35.375
No, I'm on thin ice as it is.

46:35.458 --> 46:37.041
We can offer to help around the club.

46:37.125 --> 46:39.291
-Oh, I think this is a great idea.
-Thank you.

46:39.375 --> 46:41.833
Absolutely not. No way.

46:43.750 --> 46:45.833
Honestly, guys, it's not up to me.

47:00.333 --> 47:03.041
TERRELL: Hey, table six,
can my brother use the piano?

47:04.375 --> 47:06.000
Roxanne.

47:13.750 --> 47:15.375
Uh, Roxanne?

47:18.833 --> 47:24.666
Uh, can we please, please use the piano?

47:25.875 --> 47:27.333
We'd really appreciate it.

47:38.708 --> 47:43.416
It might be your piano,
but it will be our thing. Promise.

47:46.458 --> 47:47.958
Have at it.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.583
It's all about to change

48:21.625 --> 48:24.166
It's all about...

48:24.583 --> 48:26.333
Oh, yeah, and then can we...

48:27.041 --> 48:28.458
Can we go, like...

Can we put it all together?

48:45.208 --> 48:49.708
Looks like it's all about to change

48:55.041 --> 48:57.250
Life is such a

48:59.416 --> 49:01.500
Funny, stupid game

49:04.208 --> 49:07.208
-That actually sounds pretty good.
-Thanks, man.

49:07.291 --> 49:08.791
Oh, and then that other line
I wrote about?

49:09.083 --> 49:10.333
Oh, yeah.

49:11.083 --> 49:12.875
I love that one. Um...

You say the word, and I'll say the same

Yeah.

49:40.500 --> 49:41.500

-Like the new... the new one?
-Oh, yeah.

50:03.750 --> 50:06.583
And then can we go back
to that one melody that we had?

50:07.041 --> 50:09.125
Oh, yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

(VOCALIZING)

50:16.625 --> 50:18.708
(BOTH VOCALIZING)

This will be the chorus

50:32.208 --> 50:33.208

50:33.291 --> 50:36.541
And it's gonna be a really good chorus

50:37.916 --> 50:40.416
We'll just figure it out as we go

50:42.166 --> 50:44.458
And then back to the thing, the...

50:45.958 --> 50:48.208
(BOTH VOCALIZING)

50:48.291 --> 50:49.791
Yeah.

51:06.833 --> 51:07.833
This isn't right.

51:08.291 --> 51:10.916
Hey, I know you're used to talking
to people however you feel...

51:11.000 --> 51:13.458
It's gonna need some drums and bass.

51:13.541 --> 51:14.958
Maybe some other percussion.

51:15.041 --> 51:18.041
You're gonna need
to find some place to record it, right?

51:18.125 --> 51:19.958
Playback for your Swizzle McGizzle.

-Whatever.
-We were gonna record it in my apartment.

51:23.708 --> 51:26.541
I have some basic stuff.

51:27.291 --> 51:28.291
Oh, do you?

51:29.250 --> 51:32.041
Listen, Mr. Waiter-Slash-Director,

51:32.125 --> 51:34.375
I respect ambition more than anyone,

51:34.458 --> 51:37.875
but I think I know a place that's
a little bit better than your apartment.

51:40.583 --> 51:42.083
It's a really nice apartment.

51:42.791 --> 51:44.208
I'm sure it is.

51:44.750 --> 51:45.750
STARGIRL: Wait, what?

51:46.541 --> 51:49.458
When it's finished,
we'll record it at Sunset Sound.

51:49.541 --> 51:50.541
I know some people.

51:52.083 --> 51:55.833
Oh, and I didn't not give you my song
because I'm mean.

51:55.916 --> 51:59.041
I didn't give it to you 'cause
I knew you could write your own.

52:03.375 --> 52:04.583
Back to work.

52:12.125 --> 52:15.625
Let's take it from the top again.
Here we go.

52:36.583 --> 52:41.041
Looks like it's all about to change

52:43.333 --> 52:48.333
Life is such a funny, stupid game

52:50.916 --> 52:55.541
You say the word and I'll say the same

52:58.458 --> 53:05.416
Maybe we can just run away

53:07.541 --> 53:10.041
(VOCALIZING)

53:20.458 --> 53:21.458
(INAUDIBLE)

53:21.541 --> 53:24.291
Can't always see way down the road

53:24.375 --> 53:27.916
Too busy looking at the trees
out my window

53:28.000 --> 53:31.958
And we'll make it up as we go

53:35.500 --> 53:39.208
And you crashed the party
right on time

53:39.291 --> 53:42.333
Just as the music died
and on came the lights

53:42.791 --> 53:47.291
So help me up
bring me back to life

53:49.208 --> 53:50.541
Life

53:51.958 --> 53:55.125
Maybe I don't know

53:55.541 --> 53:57.833
Oh, oh, oh

53:58.541 --> 54:01.458
We'll just figure it out as we go

54:06.541 --> 54:09.791
'Cause no one really knows

54:10.250 --> 54:12.666
Oh, oh, oh

54:13.291 --> 54:16.541
We all just figure it out as we go

54:20.750 --> 54:24.125
Way down on Martin Lane

54:25.083 --> 54:27.458
Ooh

54:27.541 --> 54:31.500
Some rich, old man cut down everything

54:35.250 --> 54:38.708
Put up a building, but don't you know

54:41.875 --> 54:46.291
All the flowers and vines
just continue to grow

54:50.791 --> 54:53.625
And deserts will get cold

54:54.541 --> 54:56.875
And no one really knows

54:57.500 --> 55:00.458
We all just figure it out as we go

55:05.166 --> 55:08.166
So here we are right now

55:09.125 --> 55:11.833
We don't even really know how

55:12.333 --> 55:15.375
We just figure it out as we go

55:17.708 --> 55:20.375
Oh, oh, oh

55:20.458 --> 55:23.000
(VOCALIZING)

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
And maybe I don't know

55:38.916 --> 55:41.041
Oh, oh, oh

55:42.250 --> 55:45.291
We'll just figure it out as we go

55:54.666 --> 55:56.416
That was a keeper.

55:57.625 --> 55:59.125
Let's take a break.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.250
You asked me
why I didn't make another album.

56:13.166 --> 56:17.458
It was a bad situation, when I was a kid.

56:18.333 --> 56:19.958
So I left.

56:21.458 --> 56:22.916
It was scary.

56:23.791 --> 56:25.208
But I always felt better

56:25.291 --> 56:30.166
when I found the artists
and musicians, street performers.

56:30.250 --> 56:32.625
With people sharing something.

56:33.291 --> 56:36.958
And my voice got me places.
Clubs, parties.

56:37.583 --> 56:39.041
Mostly Forte.

56:40.541 --> 56:43.375
And eventually, here.

56:45.666 --> 56:49.375
This is where I recorded Miracle Mile.

56:52.083 --> 56:54.416
I put everything I had into it. I was 20.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.708
And then,

56:59.208 --> 57:01.916
nobody wanted it.

57:04.916 --> 57:07.541
I couldn't separate myself from the work.

57:07.625 --> 57:13.958
And I... And I didn't love myself enough
to be okay with failing.

57:15.791 --> 57:18.083
I felt like nobody wanted me.

57:21.541 --> 57:27.041
So I buried the album,
changed my name, started producing.

57:28.875 --> 57:31.083
And it turned out,
I was pretty good at it.

57:34.250 --> 57:38.666
But the most important thing I was able
to do with my success was save Forte.

57:39.708 --> 57:40.916
What do you mean?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.291
A few years back,
the landlords were making it really hard

57:43.375 --> 57:47.083
for Iggy to keep it open,
and so I did him a favor.

57:48.833 --> 57:51.375
Technically, I own the place.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.166
But don't tell anyone,
we like to keep it quiet.

57:54.250 --> 57:55.500
(CHUCKLES)

57:55.791 --> 57:57.958
So it is your piano.

57:59.666 --> 58:06.375
I go there every night, hoping
to hear something that inspires me,

58:06.458 --> 58:08.750
hoping to be a part of it.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.125
But you loving my album
reminded me of something.

58:15.333 --> 58:16.416
What?

58:17.125 --> 58:20.666
That just 'cause it doesn't look like
you thought it would

58:20.750 --> 58:23.375
doesn't mean you're not living your dream.

58:25.541 --> 58:27.583
BART: Hey, Roxy, sorry.

58:28.125 --> 58:29.208
Back in?

58:29.541 --> 58:31.375
Ah. Thanks, Bart.

59:09.291 --> 59:11.458
STARGIRL: Look up Roxy Jones.

59:12.625 --> 59:14.833
-Oh, my God, it's her...
-What?

59:14.916 --> 59:17.083
-It's Roxanne.
-I know.

59:17.166 --> 59:18.583
-And she's like...
-Whoa.

59:18.666 --> 59:19.750
Whoa.

59:20.541 --> 59:24.041
She produced, like, a lot of great stuff
over the past many years.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.916
-So cool.
-Yeah.

59:27.458 --> 59:29.041
-Thank you.
-Nah, no problem.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.458
(CHUCKLES)

59:32.416 --> 59:33.750
-Good night.
-Well... Yeah.

59:33.833 --> 59:35.250
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHING) Good night.

59:37.875 --> 59:39.291

59:41.625 --> 59:43.791
MITCHELL: Stargirl. Come here.

59:50.125 --> 59:54.125
I saw you all rehearsing the other day,
with the phone?

59:54.208 --> 59:55.208
Mm-hmm.

59:55.291 --> 59:57.750
Is that what you're using
to shoot this picture?

59:57.833 --> 59:59.416
-Yeah.
-(CHUCKLES)

1:00:01.083 --> 1:00:02.250
Don't go away.

1:00:08.750 --> 1:00:12.375
This is a vintage Bolex 16mm camera.

1:00:12.458 --> 1:00:16.041
You shoot film on it.
It's the only way to shoot, in my opinion.

1:00:17.250 --> 1:00:18.250
It's...

1:00:18.333 --> 1:00:20.250
It's old, but still works.

1:00:21.208 --> 1:00:22.708
What?

1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:25.791
It's just collecting dust.

1:00:26.833 --> 1:00:28.250
(LAUGHS)

1:00:29.041 --> 1:00:32.375
Thank you, Mr. Mitchell. Thank you.

1:00:32.458 --> 1:00:35.000
You just have to show me
the movie when you've finished it.

1:00:35.625 --> 1:00:39.333
-Of course. We wrote a song for it, too.
-Uh. (CHUCKLES)

1:00:40.333 --> 1:00:42.625
Thank you, again. Good night.

1:00:44.208 --> 1:00:45.458
Good night.

1:00:47.833 --> 1:00:49.541
Hollywood Stargirl.

1:00:50.166 --> 1:00:51.250

1:00:55.041 --> 1:00:56.416
Action, rehearsal.

1:00:56.500 --> 1:01:00.083
And on the day, this is when
I'll yell "playback." Come on, Evan.

1:01:00.875 --> 1:01:02.458
What does "on the day" mean?

1:01:02.541 --> 1:01:03.583
I don't know.

1:01:03.666 --> 1:01:05.000
When we shoot it for real.

1:01:05.083 --> 1:01:06.208
-Oh!
-Oh, okay.

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:07.291
Okay.

1:01:07.666 --> 1:01:10.375
Mark it. And five, six, seven, walking.

1:01:10.458 --> 1:01:14.125
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, go.

1:01:14.208 --> 1:01:18.083
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1:01:18.166 --> 1:01:22.041
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1:01:22.125 --> 1:01:25.916
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:30.791
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. Settle.

1:01:31.375 --> 1:01:33.333
And this is when you'll kiss.

1:01:35.333 --> 1:01:36.958
Okay? I'm good.

1:01:37.041 --> 1:01:38.916
And that's a cut on rehearsal.

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.500
ANA: It was 1992.

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:46.291
She was amazing.

1:01:47.083 --> 1:01:50.083
I bought her tape after the show
and then that was it.

1:01:51.208 --> 1:01:53.708
I always wondered what happened.
I can't believe all this.

1:01:53.791 --> 1:01:55.000
(CHUCKLES)

1:01:57.291 --> 1:01:59.750
Why didn't you ever tell me
you lived here?

1:02:01.250 --> 1:02:03.666
It wasn't a great time in my life.

1:02:05.666 --> 1:02:08.125
To be honest,
I don't love talking about it.

1:02:09.666 --> 1:02:12.500
But Roxanne's music really got me through.

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:24.625
For Ana- XX Roxy-
Miracle Mile - Roxanne Martel

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:29.083
Can I get you two anything else?

1:02:29.458 --> 1:02:31.625
-No, thanks, we're fine.
-Okay.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:34.416
We're fine.

1:02:37.208 --> 1:02:38.625
STARGIRL: Thank you, Mr. Mitchell,

1:02:38.708 --> 1:02:40.166
but I talked to Terrell,

1:02:40.250 --> 1:02:43.625
and he said we would need to buy the film
and develop it and everything.

1:02:43.750 --> 1:02:46.458
And we just...

1:02:47.083 --> 1:02:49.166
We don't have the money for that.

1:02:50.041 --> 1:02:54.333
-But it was so, so nice of you.
-Sell it.

1:02:55.250 --> 1:02:56.250
What?

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.666
I don't know how much you could get,

1:02:58.750 --> 1:03:01.166
but buy something else
you need for your picture.

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:03.041
I insist.

1:03:04.125 --> 1:03:06.583
I can give you, like, 300 for it.

1:03:08.708 --> 1:03:10.000
Cool.

1:03:11.583 --> 1:03:12.916
Evan, look.

1:03:14.291 --> 1:03:15.791
How much are these?

1:03:28.416 --> 1:03:30.250
You guys look great!

1:03:30.541 --> 1:03:32.625
Thank you. Is this okay? My mom made it.

1:03:32.708 --> 1:03:34.416
She wanted to be here, but she had work.

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:37.416
-Yes. You look beautiful.
-Thank you, thank you.

1:03:38.500 --> 1:03:41.208
-Loosen up.
-Loose. Loosen up. Okay. (LAUGHS)

1:03:41.833 --> 1:03:44.000
-All right, let's roll.

-TERRELL: Thanks, Pedro.

1:04:47.166 --> 1:04:48.875
Mike, remember that first step...

1:04:49.500 --> 1:04:51.958
The costume looked great
on camera, by the way.

1:04:52.041 --> 1:04:54.916
I'm so sad I couldn't be there to see it.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:58.583
I know what making movies is like now.

1:04:58.666 --> 1:04:59.666
I get it.

-Oh, hang on. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1:05:05.625 --> 1:05:07.083
I didn't get to tell you.

1:05:07.458 --> 1:05:09.791
Uh, we were able to sell your camera,

1:05:10.375 --> 1:05:14.875
and we bought a lens and stuff
for the iPhone.

1:05:15.833 --> 1:05:19.791
(SIGHS) So at least now, it will look
a little bit more like a real...

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:22.583
Like a real picture.

1:05:22.666 --> 1:05:24.166
-Thank you.
-(CHUCKLES)

1:05:25.083 --> 1:05:26.958
So, does that make you a producer?

1:05:27.583 --> 1:05:30.166
(LAUGHS) No.

1:05:31.708 --> 1:05:34.541
But you helped the movie.
Isn't that what producers do?

1:05:35.583 --> 1:05:38.916
Well, I, uh, suppose...

1:05:41.291 --> 1:05:42.458
You're right.

When it's all done, and it's all edited,
I'll let everybody know

1:08:37.458 --> 1:08:38.625
we did it.

And we did it together.

spending time with the people
you care about,

it. He's a legend, and it's iconic.

a little more work still.

Some character stuff,
some dialogue polishing.

financing for about a million, which...

1:15:36.458 --> 1:15:41.916

Is that okay?

1:15:46.958 --> 1:15:47.958
Yeah.

1:15:48.083 --> 1:15:49.666
Yeah, I think that's okay.

1:15:51.083 --> 1:15:52.083
Good.

1:15:52.375 --> 1:15:55.958
Along with the script, I think at least
one more song would be great.

1:15:56.041 --> 1:15:57.625
But let's get everything set up

1:15:57.708 --> 1:16:02.208
so we can get you something for your time
and cover expenses and stuff.

1:16:02.375 --> 1:16:03.416
How's that sound?

1:16:06.041 --> 1:16:07.208
Like a dream.

1:16:15.458 --> 1:16:16.958
Mom, you're home.

1:16:17.041 --> 1:16:19.458
I have so much to tell you.

1:16:20.625 --> 1:16:21.625
Are you okay?

1:16:23.625 --> 1:16:24.750
What's wrong?

1:16:28.333 --> 1:16:30.416
My movie got shut down.

1:16:31.416 --> 1:16:32.416
What?

1:16:33.791 --> 1:16:37.708
Daniel said something to Jody
and she walked off set,

1:16:38.375 --> 1:16:40.666
and when the studio heard about it,

1:16:40.791 --> 1:16:42.625
I guess they already
had some complaints,

1:16:42.708 --> 1:16:45.500
and so they're doing an investigation.

1:16:47.625 --> 1:16:49.666
And they sent us home... (SNIFFLES)

1:16:49.750 --> 1:16:51.125
and we don't know what's gonna happen.

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:53.791
I'm so sorry.

1:16:54.458 --> 1:16:55.875
It's not fair at all.

1:17:01.333 --> 1:17:03.000
What did you want to tell me?

1:17:03.125 --> 1:17:04.708
Uh, I-I can tell you later.

1:17:05.666 --> 1:17:07.708
I don't know why I'm so surprised.

1:17:07.791 --> 1:17:10.375
I mean, I didn't think
they'd shut us down, but...

1:17:12.916 --> 1:17:14.416
He is so awful.

1:17:16.583 --> 1:17:18.333
Well, you'll get another job.

1:17:19.583 --> 1:17:21.625
And they have to help with that. Right?

1:17:24.791 --> 1:17:26.333
I have another job.

1:17:28.041 --> 1:17:29.166
What do you mean?

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:33.208
I'm gonna take the job in Berkeley.

1:17:37.125 --> 1:17:39.625
You said that we were staying
for the whole year.

1:17:39.708 --> 1:17:41.125
When I made that promise,

1:17:41.208 --> 1:17:44.291
I never would have guessed
they would've shut my movie down.

1:17:44.375 --> 1:17:45.750
I am so happy here.

1:17:46.375 --> 1:17:49.250
-I don't want to lose that.
-I don't want you to lose that.

1:17:49.333 --> 1:17:52.458
I have been sitting here trying
to figure out how we can stay,

1:17:52.583 --> 1:17:54.125
but I have to take care of us

1:17:54.208 --> 1:17:56.500
and in order to do that
I have to have a job.

1:17:56.583 --> 1:17:59.791
We are making the movie,
and I'm gonna make money.

1:17:59.875 --> 1:18:01.333
Sweetheart...

1:18:01.416 --> 1:18:03.125
And you can get another job.

1:18:03.208 --> 1:18:05.833
Do you even know when they're
gonna start shooting this move?

1:18:05.916 --> 1:18:08.750
Do you know how much
they're gonna pay you? Honey,

1:18:08.833 --> 1:18:10.375
this is real life.

1:18:11.750 --> 1:18:14.208
Which is only an adventure
when you want it to be.

1:18:15.875 --> 1:18:17.208
That's not fair.

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:23.541
You're just scared,
and it's ruining everything.

1:18:30.333 --> 1:18:32.166
(UKELELE STRUMMING)

1:18:41.333 --> 1:18:48.333
What will the ending be like

1:18:51.583 --> 1:18:53.833
Heaven knows

1:18:54.541 --> 1:18:55.541
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

1:18:55.625 --> 1:18:58.375
ANA: I'm gonna leave some boxes
outside your door.

1:19:00.541 --> 1:19:02.166
Are you still not talking to me?

1:19:04.916 --> 1:19:05.916
Okay.

1:19:11.041 --> 1:19:12.250
Here we go again.

(MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:16.291
(INAUDIBLE)

1:19:52.625 --> 1:19:55.041
I spent my whole life
watching movies getting made.

1:19:57.750 --> 1:19:59.166
From windows,

1:20:01.250 --> 1:20:03.916
street corners, across parking lots.

1:20:05.208 --> 1:20:08.750
Can't hear anything, can't really
see what's being filmed,

1:20:10.375 --> 1:20:11.791
but you can see the people.

1:20:12.708 --> 1:20:16.000
Moving around, working, doing their thing.

1:20:19.666 --> 1:20:21.666
People always say that it's boring.

1:20:22.041 --> 1:20:25.875
I always thought it was exciting
to watch it from across the street.

1:20:27.833 --> 1:20:31.541
Can you imagine being lucky enough
to be a part of it and call it boring?

1:20:37.291 --> 1:20:38.916
Well, for me, it's about the movie.

1:20:41.250 --> 1:20:42.541
I believe in myself.

1:20:43.291 --> 1:20:44.500
I know I'll make it.

1:20:46.333 --> 1:20:47.333
For Evan,

1:20:48.583 --> 1:20:49.583
it's about you.

1:20:51.958 --> 1:20:54.000
Do you think he'll at least say goodbye?

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:56.500
Yeah.

1:20:56.916 --> 1:20:58.083
Of course.

1:20:59.416 --> 1:21:00.666
I believe in you, too.

1:21:02.750 --> 1:21:04.458
And I can't wait to see it.

1:21:06.333 --> 1:21:09.041
Tell Priya I'll sign whatever
she needs to me to sign.

1:21:09.125 --> 1:21:10.500
The song is always yours.

1:21:10.916 --> 1:21:13.625
Anything you need to keep the movie going.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:17.666
Just don't forget me
when you own all the places.

1:21:29.541 --> 1:21:32.125
MR. MITCHELL: You know,
I thought I was done.

1:21:33.625 --> 1:21:38.583
I thought I'd just watch my shows,
go to the Gelson's,

1:21:39.291 --> 1:21:42.125
and, um, just wait it out.

1:21:44.041 --> 1:21:45.541
I mean, I was always...

1:21:46.958 --> 1:21:50.333
I was always so good at,
uh, fixing problems with movies,

1:21:50.416 --> 1:21:53.333
but I was never that good in my own life.

1:21:55.500 --> 1:21:56.666
And you just...

1:21:58.250 --> 1:21:59.250
Well...

1:22:00.583 --> 1:22:04.208
You gave me something
that I thought only existed in pictures.

1:22:05.083 --> 1:22:06.083
What?

1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:07.625
Well, suddenly,

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:10.458
I'm the guy that wants to know everything

1:22:11.958 --> 1:22:13.000
and everyone.

1:22:13.833 --> 1:22:15.500
And I want them to know me.

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:20.041
And I'm gonna call my son.

1:22:27.625 --> 1:22:30.000
If you could leave me
with one piece of advice,

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:33.416
what would it be?

1:22:35.708 --> 1:22:38.416
Make mistakes, but don't regret them.

1:22:40.041 --> 1:22:41.166
Learn from them.

1:22:42.750 --> 1:22:46.875
Because regrets are the hardest things
to carry when you get older.

1:22:50.791 --> 1:22:54.208
Oh, and get yourself a flip phone.

1:22:55.791 --> 1:22:57.208
So that you and I can talk.

1:23:00.041 --> 1:23:03.000
How else are you gonna tell me
how it goes with your son?

1:23:03.583 --> 1:23:04.875
Well, there you go.

1:23:20.708 --> 1:23:22.166
I screwed this up.

1:23:23.250 --> 1:23:25.458
Okay? I know I did.

1:23:27.333 --> 1:23:29.000
I screwed it up a lot.

1:23:31.375 --> 1:23:32.708
But you're great.

1:23:33.166 --> 1:23:34.458
You're so great.

1:23:35.166 --> 1:23:38.250
You are, like, the most alive person
I've ever met.

1:23:39.958 --> 1:23:41.000
(SIGHS)

1:23:45.416 --> 1:23:47.541
I stress out about

1:23:47.666 --> 1:23:50.500
not being able to support us
or take care of you.

1:23:50.583 --> 1:23:52.166
I just... I look at you,

1:23:53.208 --> 1:23:58.041
I think, "I made her,
and she's so extraordinary."

1:23:59.750 --> 1:24:01.375
So at least I did that right.

1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.625
I have done so many things
wrong in my life, but thank God

1:24:07.041 --> 1:24:09.708
the thing that mattered most
turned out the best.

1:24:16.458 --> 1:24:19.166
I think about how hard
it must be to have a kid.

1:24:20.666 --> 1:24:24.708
And how much harder
it must be to do it alone.

1:24:26.333 --> 1:24:27.833
You think about that?

1:24:28.208 --> 1:24:29.500
Sometimes, yeah.

1:24:30.958 --> 1:24:32.958
I know 40-year-olds
who don't think about that.

1:24:33.208 --> 1:24:34.208
(LAUGHS)

1:24:40.583 --> 1:24:44.625
When I came to LA in the '90s,
when I saw Roxanne,

1:24:45.583 --> 1:24:47.625
I was here doing a movie.

1:24:47.708 --> 1:24:49.625
-You were?
-Yeah, I was.

1:24:49.708 --> 1:24:53.125
I always wanted to do movies.
It was my dream.

1:24:54.125 --> 1:24:56.041
And the director didn't like my work.

1:24:56.250 --> 1:24:59.375
And he ended up not being a nice person,

1:24:59.458 --> 1:25:02.875
which is becoming, uh,
a little bit of a theme.

1:25:03.208 --> 1:25:04.791
Either way, I got fired.

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:08.875
And I was so sad, so embarrassed.

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.125
So I just left LA,

1:25:13.958 --> 1:25:15.291
and I felt better.

1:25:16.708 --> 1:25:19.208
I thought it was easier
just not to deal with it,

1:25:19.291 --> 1:25:22.000
which I know is wrong and terrible, but...

1:25:23.250 --> 1:25:26.000
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1:25:27.583 --> 1:25:30.125
It just feels like
it's happening all over again.

1:25:31.250 --> 1:25:32.875
And I feel so foolish.

1:25:34.875 --> 1:25:36.041
No, Mom.

1:25:36.958 --> 1:25:38.000
It's brave.

1:25:39.625 --> 1:25:41.125
You were alone.

1:25:42.208 --> 1:25:43.875
But you're not alone anymore.

1:25:45.125 --> 1:25:48.041
I don't want you to lose what you
have here. I really don't.

1:25:48.166 --> 1:25:49.750
So, then what if we didn't go?

1:25:51.208 --> 1:25:53.666
Daphne said that she would give us
the month free.

1:25:53.750 --> 1:25:57.916
It's not the rent. I have rent.
I don't have a job.

1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.875
-You'll find one.
-What if I don't?

1:25:59.958 --> 1:26:02.583
-And what if the Berkeley thing goes away?
-I don't know.

1:26:04.041 --> 1:26:08.041
But I will be right by your side,
no matter what happens.

1:26:09.250 --> 1:26:13.041
So, I'm asking just this once.

1:26:14.958 --> 1:26:16.125
What if we stayed?

1:26:18.750 --> 1:26:21.333
'Cause I do what I want,
I say what I feel

I hold on to what I have here and now

1:26:28.708 --> 1:26:33.500
Yeah, I know you wear silver coats

1:26:33.583 --> 1:26:40.000

1:27:27.875 --> 1:27:29.333
Table six forever.

1:27:29.791 --> 1:27:32.416
As I was saying, I'm sitting at my table

1:27:32.541 --> 1:27:35.000
and Iggy comes up to me
and tells me I need to go outside.

1:27:35.083 --> 1:27:36.916
-It's really important.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.166
I was annoyed.

1:27:39.041 --> 1:27:43.333
But then I get out there
and it's this kid.

1:27:44.458 --> 1:27:46.750
When I saw it was this kid,
I wasn't so mad anymore.

1:27:46.833 --> 1:27:48.583
She has that effect on us grumps.

1:27:48.958 --> 1:27:53.541
Hell, she is the first person to get me
on this stage in 15 years.

(CHEERING)

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.833
Sometimes we just go, you know?

1:28:02.583 --> 1:28:06.041
And we go, and we go, and we go.

1:28:07.291 --> 1:28:08.500
She made me stop.

1:28:11.541 --> 1:28:12.708
She made me look.

1:28:14.791 --> 1:28:16.833
Sometimes it's that simple.

1:28:24.708 --> 1:28:25.708
(SIGHS)

1:28:26.250 --> 1:28:30.541
The first time I was up here,
I had just gotten to LA.

1:28:31.958 --> 1:28:37.125
And all I wanted was to stay somewhere
long enough to make some real friends.

1:28:38.625 --> 1:28:40.000
And I got more than that.

1:28:41.583 --> 1:28:44.833
Something I never expected.

1:28:46.916 --> 1:28:47.916
I got a home.

1:28:50.125 --> 1:28:52.541
I've always had a family,

1:28:53.083 --> 1:28:54.958
just my mom and me, and...

1:28:56.083 --> 1:28:58.958
we've gotten each other through a lot.

1:29:01.416 --> 1:29:03.250
But we've never had a home.

1:29:03.875 --> 1:29:06.166
And I don't mean a building.

1:29:07.666 --> 1:29:12.708
Home is somewhere you feel safe
to dream crazy things,

1:29:13.083 --> 1:29:15.875
and the people there are crazy enough
to dream them with you.

1:29:17.833 --> 1:29:19.041
But also

1:29:19.125 --> 1:29:22.291
be there for you when things
don't turn out the way you hoped.

1:29:23.833 --> 1:29:28.791
My home turned out to be
a random bunch of people.

1:29:29.541 --> 1:29:33.250
And now I never want to be
without them again.

1:29:35.875 --> 1:29:37.291
And so...

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.500
we're staying.

1:29:41.750 --> 1:29:43.250
My mom and I are staying.

-Yeah, we are!

1:29:47.375 --> 1:29:49.250
Oh, I hear it, and I love it.

1:29:52.666 --> 1:29:55.333
I'm staying in LA. I'm staying in LA.

1:29:55.416 --> 1:29:57.166
It's my home. It's my home.

Yes.

1:30:08.583 --> 1:30:10.333
(LAUGHTER)

1:30:10.416 --> 1:30:15.666
So, here is one of Roxanne's,
and my old favorites.

1:30:16.125 --> 1:30:19.416
And this one
is for all the dreamers out there.

1:30:20.416 --> 1:30:21.916
(MUSIC STARTS)

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.208
When I met you in the restaurant

1:30:53.250 --> 1:30:57.208
You could tell I was no debutante

1:31:00.333 --> 1:31:03.666
You asked me what's my pleasure

1:31:03.750 --> 1:31:06.666
A movie or a measure?

1:31:06.750 --> 1:31:11.125
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my

Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?

1:31:33.125 --> 1:31:34.916
MAN: Table Six forever!

1:31:35.541 --> 1:31:39.166
Reel to reel is living rarity

1:31:39.916 --> 1:31:42.375
People stop and stare at me

1:31:42.791 --> 1:31:45.333
We just walk on by

1:31:45.416 --> 1:31:48.750
We just keep on dreaming

-Walking a two mile

-Meet me at the turnstile

-Even for a little while

I sit by and watch the river flow

1:32:23.333 --> 1:32:27.333
I sit by and watch the traffic go

1:32:29.083 --> 1:32:33.250
Imagine something of your very own

1:32:33.708 --> 1:32:36.458
Something you can have and hold

1:32:36.583 --> 1:32:41.166
I'd build a road in gold just to have some
