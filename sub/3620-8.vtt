LOOK AT THAT.
YOUR GIRLFRIEND CAN READ, HUH?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.518
WHAT'D HE DO?

10:06.693 --> 10:08.346
BROKE PAROLE.
CONSORTING WITH A KNOWN FELON.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.566
MAN, THAT'S
NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.568
ACTUALLY, NO, I DON'T.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.138
I WOULDN'T HANG AROUND
OUT HERE, LADY, IF I WERE YOU.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.227
NOT DRESSED LIKE THAT.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.027
WOW. THESE ARE
SO GRETA GARBO.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.029
HEY, NOW
THERE'S A WOMAN

10:39.203 --> 10:41.728
THAT DIDN'T NEED A MAN
TO MAKE HER FEEL COMPLETE.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.469
HEY, BILLIE,
THOSE ARE EVIDENCE, OK?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.646
AND NOT TO MENTION
SOMEBODY PROBABLY
DIED IN THEM.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.301
HELLO. NO. I SAID
I'M DYING TO SEE YOU.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.434
IT JUST MUST BE
A REALLY BAD CONNECTION.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.785
NOW, THIS IS THE KIND
OF BONDAGE MEN WANT US IN?

10:55.959 --> 10:58.005
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU BOTHER HOOKING UP.

10:58.179 --> 10:59.659
AFTER SEEING THIS GUY
IN MY CLASS THIS MORNING,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.617
I AM SO SURE
WOMEN SHOULD BE ON TOP.

11:01.791 --> 11:02.966
DO YOU MIND?

11:03.140 --> 11:04.794
I'M SORRY. I MEANT THAT
METAPHORICALLY.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.450
WELL, I'M SPEAKING TO A GUY,
AND HE MEANS METAPHYSICALLY.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.582
YEAH, SEE,
THAT'S THE THING.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.672
MEN JUST KEEP USING
THEIR LITTLE HEADS

11:12.846 --> 11:15.675
TO DO ALL
THE THINKING FOR THEM.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.721
YOU KNOW, THIS
WHOLE YIN/YANG THING,
IT'S A COMPLETE HOAX.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.723
LOOK AT THIS LAME GIG.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.595
ONCE AGAIN,
THE MALE ESTABLISHMENT
IS USING WOMEN'S AWESOME SKILLS

11:23.770 --> 11:24.727
FOR THEIR BUSYWORK.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.729
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT TO GO, OK?

11:26.903 --> 11:28.688

TO SEE YOU, TOO. SUNDAY.

11:30.515 --> 11:34.955
HEY, CAN WE LAY OFF
THE MALE BASHING, PLEASE?

11:35.129 --> 11:38.523
SORRY. I'VE JUST HAD ONE
TOO MANY LAME DATES LATELY.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.788
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
EVERYONE I GO OUT WITH
IS SO IMMATURE AND CHILDISH.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.094
DOES THAT EVER CHANGE?
DO THEY EVER GROW UP?

11:44.268 --> 11:46.662
WELL, IF I EVER
GET OUT OF HERE,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.796
HEY. CHECK THIS THING OUT.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.972
NO, NO. NO.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.369
UH, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

11:58.543 --> 12:00.981

IS UNBELIEVABLE.

PAIGE ORBS.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.691
DOES ANYONE
STOP AND THINK THAT
PHOEBE CAN'T ORB?

12:15.865 --> 12:18.563
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHY? BECAUSE
IT'S ALL ABOUT THEM.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.565
OK, HI. YEAH. I CAN'T
GET THIS THING OFF.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.611
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.
IT'S GONNA TAKE A SPELL

12:22.785 --> 12:25.875
OR A POTION OR SOME KIND
OF EMOTIONAL EPIPHANY.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.790
THAT BLOWS.
ARE YOU SURE?

12:29.879 --> 12:33.230
I'VE BEEN TURNED
INTO A MERMAID,
A MUMMY, A GENIE.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.276
TRUST ME.
I KNOW THESE THINGS.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.888
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I FEEL SO STUPID.
I HAD TO PUT THE BELT ON.

12:39.062 --> 12:41.369
IT'S OK. JUST THINK
OF IT AS INITIATION.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.284
IT HAPPENS
TO THE BEST OF US.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.503
SO IT'S NOT THAT BAD?

12:45.677 --> 12:47.201
OH, NO. IT'S BAD.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.420
IT'S VERY, VERY BAD.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.815

VANQUISH ME NOW.

YOU DO TO MY CAB?

PUT IT BACK,
PUT IT BACK.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.961

13:14.054 --> 13:15.969
A DORMANT POWER'S
JUST BEEN ACTIVATED.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.145
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DORMANT?

13:18.319 --> 13:20.321
WELL, JUDGING
BY ITS INTENSITY AND
FREQUENCY OF THE EMISSIONS,

13:20.495 --> 13:22.410
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE CRYSTAL OF KAZIMAR.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.934
BUT IT'S EVEN
MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.849
THE GOLDEN BELT OF GAEA.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.895
"THE GODDESSES' GIFT
TO HIPPOLYTA

13:29.069 --> 13:32.812
ENDOWS THE WOMAN WEARING IT
WITH TRANSCENDENT POWERS."

13:32.986 --> 13:34.857
I'M SOLD. HOW DO I GET IT?

13:35.031 --> 13:36.859
TRUST ME.
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.731
IT WOULD DESTROY YOU
THE MOMENT YOU PUT IT ON.

13:39.906 --> 13:40.950
YOU'RE EVIL.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.213
THEN WHAT GOOD IS IT TO ME?

13:43.387 --> 13:46.173
WELL, YOU COULD STILL
APPROPRIATE ITS POWERS

13:46.347 --> 13:48.175
BY GETTING THE WOMAN
WHO'S WEARING IT

13:48.349 --> 13:50.438
TO DO YOUR BIDDING
FOR YOU.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.788
HOW, IF SHE'S GOOD?

13:52.962 --> 13:55.182
THE BELT'S POWER
WILL COMPEL HER

13:55.356 --> 13:56.792
TO USE ITS FORCE

13:56.966 --> 13:59.273
WHETHER SHE
WANTS TO OR NOT.

13:59.447 --> 14:03.451
IN TIME, IT'LL DRIVE HER
TO MADNESS, CONSUME HER.

14:05.148 --> 14:08.238
OF COURSE, IF YOU WERE
TO BEFRIEND HER BEFORE THAT...

14:08.412 --> 14:10.632
THEN I CAN GET HER
TO USE THE POWERS FOR ME,

14:10.806 --> 14:12.852
TO GET RID OF TAI.

DOES HOMELAND
SECURITY WANT

14:50.106 --> 14:51.673

HE'S GONNA LEARN THAT.

TO LEARN THAT? IN JAIL?

14:59.159 --> 15:01.770
NO. WE TRY TO SCARE HIM
SO THAT MAYBE HE WON'T
GO BACK TO JAIL.

THAN HAVE SOMEBODY

IN THE WAY OF GOOD BUSINESS.

BUT I AM ALSO, IN FACT, STUPID.

TO MY PRINCIPLES.

WITH THE MUDSLINGING AND
THINK ABOUT THIS RATIONALLY.

AMAZING CONNECTIONS.

CAN'T GET MAD AT HER
BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FAULT.

HOW TO GET IT OFF OF HER.

HUH. ALL RIGHT. FINE.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.367
CAME UP WITH A WAY
TO TAKE IT OFF.

BY ATTACKING

BUT IT MUST BE MORE
THAN JUST AN ATTACK.

TO COME TO HER AID.

BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION.

IMAGINE YOUR STATUS
IN THE UNDERWORLD

SUCH A TROPHY BACK.

TAKE THE BELT AWAY FROM HER.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.829
IT WON'T BE EASY.

THAN SORRY.

FOR THE BELT'S ARRIVAL.

FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET THAT THING OFF YOU.

OUT OF THAT GET-UP.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.259
I SCRATCHED
MY PRETTY BELT.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.522
OH, DEAR. NOW
IT'S HER "PRETTY BELT."

19:35.696 --> 19:37.654
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:37.828 --> 19:41.658
IT JUST MEANS
THAT MAYBE THE BELT IS
STARTING TO AFFECT YOU.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.965
I DON'T THINK THE BELT
IS STARTING TO AFFECT ME.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.837
OK? I WOULD KNOW IF--
OH, HOLD ON.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.839
I THINK
I'M GETTING A CALL.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.625
A CALL?

19:51.799 --> 19:53.757
YEAH. I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

19:53.931 --> 19:54.845
OH!

19:55.019 --> 19:58.588
[LEO GRUNTS] THAT'S GOOD.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.374
Leo: WHOA!

20:01.548 --> 20:05.421
Leo: ANYBODY? HELP? ANYBODY?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.256
♪ OVER HERE ♪

20:14.430 --> 20:16.040
WE'RE COMING FOR YOU.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.999
DEAR GOD, HELP!

20:24.005 --> 20:26.790
THAT'S NO WAY
TO TREAT A WOMAN.

20:26.964 --> 20:27.965
GET THE BELT.

20:28.139 --> 20:30.141
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.766
MEN.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.729
SWEETIE, HONEY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:52.903 --> 20:55.384
Leo: YEAH. EXCEPT
FOR THE FACT THAT
NOBODY CAN SEE ME.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.996
AND THE FACT THAT THE GIRL
THAT DID THAT TO YOU IS
OUT DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.128
WE HAVE TO FIND HER.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.219
Leo: WHOA!
WATCH THE DOOR!

21:07.048 --> 21:09.659
UM, SORRY. I'M STILL GETTING
USED TO THIS BLURRING THING,

21:09.833 --> 21:11.139
BUT, OH, IS IT FUN.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.184
FUN? YOU'RE HAVING FUN?

21:13.359 --> 21:15.535
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

21:15.709 --> 21:19.234
WELL, LET'S SEE.
I RESCUED A WOMAN IN DISTRESS,

21:19.408 --> 21:21.715
I KILLED OFF
A BUNCH OF MALE DEMONS,

21:21.889 --> 21:23.717
AND I SCRATCHED
MY PRETTY BELT AGAIN.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.110
OK, BILLIE, I THINK

21:26.285 --> 21:28.504
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE
TOO ATTACHED TO THAT THING.

21:28.678 --> 21:31.246
YEAH, UNTIL
WE GET IT OFF,

21:31.420 --> 21:32.856
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
KIND OF STAY PUT.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.206
NO, I DON'T
WANNA TAKE IT OFF.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.208
IT MAKES ME FEEL POWERFUL.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.994
Leo: SEE,
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.304
ACTUALLY,
HERE'S A PROBLEM.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.958
WHY ARE MEN
SO THREATENED
BY POWERFUL WOMEN?

21:48.132 --> 21:51.266
HEY, LOOK, I'M BUSY.
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I HAVE TIME.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.224
THERE IS NOTHING WORSE
THAN A NEEDY GUY.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.009
RIGHT.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.576
Leo: LADIES,
I THINK THE BELT'S
AFFECTING YOU, TOO.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.142
OH, SHUSH IT, WILL YOU?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.275
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN
MAKE HIS VOICE DISAPPEAR?

22:00.449 --> 22:01.755
Leo: WHICH MEANS
IT'S GROWING STRONGER.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.234
OH, YOU ARE
SUCH A DOWNER.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.280
NO WONDER
I MADE YOU
INVISIBLE.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.282
OOPS. MY MIDTERM.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

22:07.456 --> 22:10.241
HEY, COULD YOU MAKE LEO
VISIBLE AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.026
REALLY? WHY?

22:12.200 --> 22:15.290
WELL, HE'S GOT
TO PLAY GOLF APPARENTLY
TO GET ME A BAND.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.423
SO WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?
IT'S A MAN'S WORLD.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.424
[LEO CHUCKLING]

22:18.598 --> 22:21.470
I GUESS I CAN TRY.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.604
OH, IT WORKED.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.996
RIGHT ON.

22:29.609 --> 22:30.784
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.655
I THINK HER POWERS
ARE GETTING STRONGER.

22:32.829 --> 22:33.961
AND TAKING HER OVER.

22:34.135 --> 22:37.268
WELL, THEN
WE HAVE TO STOP HER.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.533
HE WANTS TO GO
AFTER HER AGAIN.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.622
I CAN'T HOLD HIM OFF
MUCH LONGER.

22:42.796 --> 22:45.581
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK?
WHY DIDN'T SHE KILL HIM?

22:45.755 --> 22:47.191
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.715
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

22:48.889 --> 22:51.544
TAI'S ALIVE. MALE DEMONS
ARE STILL IN CONTROL.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.894
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY WONDER WITCH HERE
TO HELP ME CHANGE THINGS.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.157
SHE KILLED HIS GANG,
DIDN'T SHE?

22:56.331 --> 22:58.812
THAT MEANS THE BELT'S HOLD
ON HER IS STRENGTHENING.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.510
NOW, SOON SHE'LL BE
SO INTOXICATED BY IT,

23:01.684 --> 23:03.686
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE
YOUR MOVE, TURN HER.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.688
NOT IF TAI KILLS ME FIRST.

23:05.862 --> 23:09.866
THEN USE YOUR WILES
TO HOLD HIM AT BAY
UNTIL I CAN FIND HER.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.304
SHE WILL BE YOURS FOR
THE TAKING IN NO TIME.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.180
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT...

23:19.354 --> 23:22.052
OR ELSE THERE'LL BE
ONE MORE MALE DEMON

23:22.226 --> 23:24.141
TO BECOME EXTINCT.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.508

23:42.682 --> 23:45.032
FINALLY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.077
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:47.251 --> 23:48.905
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:49.079 --> 23:51.299
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.
I'M THE PAROLE OFFICER,
REMEMBER?

23:51.473 --> 23:54.302
HOW DID YOU GET IN?
THAT DOOR WAS LOCKED.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.825
I HAVE MY WAYS.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.610
REALLY?
OH, I'M LISTENING.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.133
LOOK--

23:59.307 --> 24:00.700
NO. YOU LOOK. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOUR NAME IS.

24:00.874 --> 24:02.353
MY NAME IS PAIGE.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.399
OK, PAIGE.
I HAVE A JOB TO DO
AND A PAROLEE TO BUST.

24:04.573 --> 24:06.401
NOW, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL THAT?

24:06.575 --> 24:07.881
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ALL THAT.
I JUST CAME HERE TO TALK TO HIM.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.273
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.754
TALK ABOUT HIS FUTURE,
HOW NOT TO BLOW IT.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.062
YOU THINK THAT
THAT'S ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE
TO KEEP HIM OUT OF TROUBLE?

24:15.236 --> 24:16.716
JUST SOME TALK?

24:16.890 --> 24:18.761
WELL, IT'S A START,
ISN'T IT?

24:21.416 --> 24:23.549
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE
IN HIM SO MUCH?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.420
WHY DON'T YOU?

24:25.594 --> 24:27.422
NO, I USED TO,
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.772
BUT I'M GETTING PRETTY TIRED
OF TRYING TO SAVE
HIS USELESS ASS.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.557
GREAT. DON'T. I'LL DO IT.

24:32.688 --> 24:33.559
YOU'LL DO IT?

24:33.733 --> 24:35.735
MM-HMM.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.171
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

24:37.345 --> 24:38.389
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:38.564 --> 24:41.001
I MEAN, HE'S NOT HERE,
IS HE? NO.

24:41.175 --> 24:44.091
WHICH MEANS HE'S WITH
DONNIE, WHICH MEANS DONNIE
TALKED HIM INTO THE JOB.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.614
JOBS ARE GOOD THINGS.

24:45.788 --> 24:49.662
NOT THAT KIND OF A JOB.
ROBBING A LIQUOR STORE.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.751
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. AND
THE COPS KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.405
AND THEY'RE GONNA
BUST HIM IN THE ACT.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.582
NO. SPEED'S
NOT GONNA BE THERE.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.281
I GOT 20 BUCKS
SAYS HE WILL.

25:00.455 --> 25:02.762
I HAVE 20 THAT SAYS
HE WON'T. YOU'RE ON.

25:02.936 --> 25:03.850
LET'S GO.

25:04.024 --> 25:04.894
WHERE?

25:05.068 --> 25:06.200
AND PROVE YOU WRONG.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.158

25:16.297 --> 25:18.429
20 MINUTES, GUYS.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.780
20 MINUTES.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.522
TALK ABOUT TACKY.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.872
HEY, SUPER BABE.
I COULD USE SOME ACTION.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.177
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.875
TEST HALF OVER.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.181
TIME YOU HAVE LEFT,
YOU'LL BE LUCKY
TO GET A "C."

25:31.355 --> 25:34.794
WOULDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING MORE
FROM A SEXIST PIG LIKE YOU.

25:34.968 --> 25:35.838
OHH.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.013
EXCUSE ME?

25:37.187 --> 25:38.972
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
YOUR THEORIES

25:39.146 --> 25:41.191
ARE SLANTED TO MORE
OF A MALE PERSPECTIVE.

25:41.365 --> 25:45.456
SO IS THE SUPERHERO
COSTUME A COMMENT
ON THE MALE HIERARCHY?

25:45.631 --> 25:47.546
I ASSUME YOU'RE
MAKING A STATEMENT.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.025
YEAH, THAT SHE'S HOT.

25:49.199 --> 25:51.027
SHUT UP, PIG!

25:51.201 --> 25:52.551
WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

25:52.725 --> 25:53.595
HEY. CHILL OUT.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.771
HUH?

25:55.945 --> 25:58.252
WAIT. STOP. THIS
ISN'T NECESSARY--

26:03.953 --> 26:05.651
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.657
THIS ISN'T WHAT
YOU WANTED, IS IT?

26:13.006 --> 26:14.311
I CAN HELP YOU.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.617
WHO ARE YOU?

26:15.791 --> 26:17.837
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.101
COME WITH ME...

26:21.275 --> 26:23.669
AND ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.903
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE MISSED HER.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.645
WELL, AT LEAST SHE LEFT
BEFORE THE ENTIRE CLASS
KILLED EACH OTHER.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.300
YOU MEAN BEFORE
THE GIRLS KILLED THE BOYS.

26:46.474 --> 26:48.302
SOUNDS LIKE HISTORY'S
REPEATING ITSELF.

26:48.476 --> 26:50.347
HIPPOLYTA
TRIED TO USE THE BELT

26:50.521 --> 26:53.307
TO CREATE HARMONY
BETWEEN THE SEXES.
IT BLEW UP IN HER FACE, TOO.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.831
DARE I ASK
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

26:56.005 --> 26:57.964
WELL, SHE RETREATED
TO AN ISLAND OF WOMEN,

26:58.138 --> 26:59.530
KILLING ANY MAN
WHO DARE TO ENTER.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.273
WELL, ONE MUST
HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH

27:03.447 --> 27:05.754
BECAUSE BILLIE SAID
HERCULES KILLED HER.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.756
WHICH IS WHY
EVERYONE WHO'S
WORN THE BELT SINCE

27:07.930 --> 27:09.758
HAS TRIED TO RID
THE ENTIRE WORLD OF MEN.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.108
OH, GREAT. JUST WHEN
I START DATING AGAIN.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.110
YOU KNOW, THAT MEANS
WYATT AND CHRIS, TOO.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.938
OH, COME ON.

27:16.112 --> 27:18.288
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES
OF THIS REALLY HAPPENING?

27:18.462 --> 27:21.161
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WORN
THE BELT BEFORE AND MEN
ARE STILL WALKING AROUND.

27:21.335 --> 27:24.425
BUT BILLIE WAS
A POWERFUL WITCH BEFORE
SHE PUT THE BELT ON,

27:24.599 --> 27:26.470
WHICH PRETTY MUCH
MAKES HER INVINCIBLE.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.082
SHE COULD DO IT
OR AT LEAST KILL
A LOT OF MEN TRYING.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.433
SO, WHAT, OUR ONLY HOPE
IS THAT THE BELT
DRIVES HER INSANE

27:32.607 --> 27:34.261
AND KILLS HER FIRST?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.524
NO, WE HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO GET
THE BELT OFF OF HER

27:36.698 --> 27:39.396
AND CONTAIN HER,
OBVIOUSLY, SO SHE
DOESN'T DO ANY MORE HARM.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.007
IF WE CAN FIND HER.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.270
I GUESS I WON'T
BE GOLFING AFTER ALL.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.446
NO. ACTUALLY,
I THINK YOU SHOULD.
YOU'RE THE TARGET.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.448
I WANT YOU
AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.537
BUT YOU'RE VULNERABLE
TO THE BELT'S POWERS.
I'M NOT.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.931
YEAH, I KNOW. BUT NOW
THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT,

27:52.105 --> 27:54.020
WE'LL KEEP OUR DISTANCE,
I PROMISE.

27:54.194 --> 27:57.719
NOW, REALLY, YOU SHOULD GO,
AND IF YOU FIND ME A BAND
IN THE PROCESS,

27:57.893 --> 28:00.461
THAT WOULDN'T BE
SUCH A BAD THING.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.468
DON'T YOU SEE?

28:07.642 --> 28:11.515
WOMEN HAVE EVOLVED WHILE
MEN HAVE GROWN MORE BARBARIC.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.517
YOUR DESTINY
IS TO UNITE WOMEN--

28:13.692 --> 28:16.303
BRING PEACE INTO THE WORLD,
AND I CAN HELP.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.304
BUT YOU'RE A DEMON.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.001
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.961
NOR WITH YOUR POWERS
WILL I HAVE TO BE ANY LONGER.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.615
THIS WHOLE
GOOD-VERSUS-EVIL PARADIGM--

28:24.790 --> 28:26.922
IT'S ALL BEEN FOSTERED
BY MEN TO DIVIDE US

28:27.096 --> 28:28.968
BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T CREATE LIFE.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.013
SO THEY TRY TO DESTROY IT.

28:31.187 --> 28:32.406
I DON'T KNOW.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.582
OH, THINK ABOUT IT.
WE'RE AT MAGIC SCHOOL.

28:34.756 --> 28:38.020
IT'S FILLED WITH DEMONS,
WHICH MEANS IF I WANTED
YOU DEAD, YOU WOULD BE.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.632
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.417
PEACE.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.636
HARMONY.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.161
JUST...LIKE...YOU.

28:50.032 --> 28:52.731
WITH WOMEN RULING,
GOOD AND EVIL GOES AWAY.

28:52.905 --> 28:56.125
ALL WALKS OF LIFE
LIVE AS ONE.

28:56.299 --> 29:00.434
OF COURSE, WE MAY HAVE
TO KILL A FEW...DE-MEN

29:00.608 --> 29:02.131
IN THE PROCESS.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.133
BUT THAT'S
WHERE YOU COME IN.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.961
I SHOULD TALK
TO THE SISTERS FIRST.

29:06.135 --> 29:09.399
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN
A WOMEN'S UTOPIA LIKE WE DO.

29:09.573 --> 29:12.228
THEY'RE STUCK IN
THE OLD WAYS, BATTLES.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.230
NO. NO, THEY'RE
VERY STRONG WOMEN.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.363
WHO HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED
BY THE MALE HIERARCHY.

29:16.537 --> 29:19.235
THEY'RE SCARED OF CHANGE.
THEY'D DO ANYTHING TO STOP YOU,

29:19.409 --> 29:22.586
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT
WE TAKE OVER MAGIC SCHOOL,

29:22.761 --> 29:24.588
MAKE IT OUR BASE.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.981
PEACE.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.635
UNITY.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.202
THINK ABOUT IT.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.510
SHE'S NOT WELL.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.991
SHE'LL BE DEAD SOON.

29:36.165 --> 29:39.603
SHE JUST NEEDS
TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH
TO KILL TAI.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.825
THEN NO ONE WILL
DARE CHALLENGE ME.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.709
[GROANS]

29:58.884 --> 30:00.146
YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:01.756 --> 30:04.715
