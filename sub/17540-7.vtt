00:26.059 --> 00:27.426
No, no, no!

00:27.461 --> 00:28.393
(grunts)

00:28.428 --> 00:29.795
Whoa.
(gasps)

00:40.707 --> 00:41.807
(exhales)

00:45.579 --> 00:46.712
Huh?

00:49.149 --> 00:50.716
I gotta go tell the others.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.888
Long live evil.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.461
M, what were you doing
at the museum?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.296
(laughs)
What?

01:04.331 --> 01:05.864
Evie, look at me.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.100
Do I look like
I would be in a museum?

01:08.135 --> 01:09.868
I followed you.
I saw you there.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.770
-(growls)
-(whimpers)

01:12.772 --> 01:15.307
Mal, it's me.
I just wanna help.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.142
Leave me alone!

01:18.512 --> 01:20.812
Your jewel.
Where did you get this?

01:20.847 --> 01:22.380
That is mine!

01:22.415 --> 01:23.815
(growls)

01:23.850 --> 01:25.484
Sorry, Mal,
can't let you have it.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.585
Ugh.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.986
Ooh.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.421
What is going on?

01:29.456 --> 01:31.223
You were being rotten
to the core.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.257
I was?

01:32.292 --> 01:34.593
Hey, the jewel.
What if it's cursed?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.728
Oh, let's see here.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.296
Evil, good.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.297
Evil, good.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.166
Evil, more evil, good.

01:41.201 --> 01:44.002
Evil, good, evil, evil,
good, evil, good.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.437
It is the jewel.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.639
Maleficent must have
cursed it years ago.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.508
And hid it
in that necklace.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.442
Freddie gave me that.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.310
Never knowing
it contained a jewel

01:52.345 --> 01:54.579
that turned you
into a raging she-witch!

01:54.614 --> 01:56.114
What are you guys
even talking about?

01:56.149 --> 01:57.282
What did I do?

01:57.317 --> 01:58.484
Well...

02:01.955 --> 02:03.121
Wow.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.023
That is horrible.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.691
Evie, please
don't be mad at me.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.160
Of course I'm mad at you.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.494
You're my best friend.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.663
And you don't treat
best friends like that.

02:11.698 --> 02:14.032
I am so, so sorry.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.001
But I also knew
it wasn't you.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.969
All along,
I knew.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.338
E, thanks for believing in me.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.540
Mal's okay!

02:21.575 --> 02:23.509
And Auradon's back to normal!

02:27.380 --> 02:29.447
Auradon will be mine!

02:29.482 --> 02:31.550
(laughs evilly)
