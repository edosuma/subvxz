{\an5}(officer)
The reason I'm stopping
you is because

00:58.024 --> 01:00.326
there was an altercation
at Newby's back there.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.828
{\an5}Who was involved?

{\an1}I was.

Can I talk to
you for a sec?

01:09.702 --> 01:10.737
(Officer)
So what's going on?

01:10.804 --> 01:11.971
I'm not gonna
lie to you, sir.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.706
This girl kept
messing with me.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.809
{\an5}She kept saying
"You're a local.
You make us look bad."

01:15.875 --> 01:18.545
{\an4}And I was, like,
"I don't make you look bad",
and she was, like, "you do."

01:18.611 --> 01:19.946
Kortni, stop.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.284
I am calm.
Shut the (bleep) up.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.852
You're not calm.
Chill the (bleep) out, Nilsa.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.754
Kortni and Nilsa are both
freaking out

01:27.821 --> 01:29.856
in the taxi right now, and it's
not helping a damn thing.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.792
{\an5}Shut the (bleep) up.
Got the window open.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.792
Shh! Kortni.

01:32.859 --> 01:36.796
{\an5}Literally, the cop

in the cab right now.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.132
You're making it a lot worse
for Aimee right now.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.401
{\an1}He says that he was holding
both of y'all apart.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.937
{\an1}And you reached around him
and hit her right in the face.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.438
That is not true.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.640
(indistinct dispatch chatter)

01:47.707 --> 01:52.011
{\an1}I've had an amazing night.

Wait, what is this?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.849

{\an1}It's a bottle of Henny!
Oh, my God!

02:04.157 --> 02:08.461
If I had to pick like a really
good gift to give Candace...

02:08.527 --> 02:12.198
either a bottle of Henny
or some jewelry, uh...

02:12.265 --> 02:13.666
probably the bottle of Henny.

02:13.733 --> 02:17.003
If we have to stick two straws
in it, we can, you know,

02:17.070 --> 02:19.506
suck on it together.
(chuckling)

02:19.572 --> 02:21.107
You did a good job, Codi.

02:21.174 --> 02:24.210
{\an4}You really, like,
showed me what a first
date should be like.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.578
And I really appreciate it.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.180
And I'ma tell you right now.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.883
If a mother(bleep) don't treat
you as good as I treated you,

{\an5}Oh, my God, literally,
one of the scariest things

of a cop car.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.197

away in a cop car.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.465
(Aimee)
I am a good person.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.734
Look at me,
I don't even belong in jail.

What the hell is happening?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.250
I know what being
in the back

03:37.317 --> 03:39.786
of a cop car feels like,
and that is not fun.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.354
{\an5}All right, so listen.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.354
{\an3}Okay.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.922
{\an1}You're being
charged with battery.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.490
You have a court date.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.493
{\an1}So instead of going to jail,
it's a notice to appear.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.296
{\an5}If you don't go to court,
you will have a warrant
for failure to appear.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.665
{\an1}And I will go to jail
for 500 years.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.001
Nobody ever said that.

happened?

No, I can (bleep) that

Kortni, you need to
shut the (bleep) up.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.581
It's so frustrating that
my roommates are trying

04:41.648 --> 04:43.583
to talk me down
because they don't know

04:43.650 --> 04:46.352
anything about Panama City.
They do not live here.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.720

frickin' everybody.

04:50.323 --> 04:53.393
And I know that I can help Aimee
in this situation right now.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.927
That mother(bleep)
didn't do anything.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.829

gonna (bleep) his life up

so shut the (bleep) up.

05:00.299 --> 05:01.567
Really, Gus?

05:01.634 --> 05:03.169
Look at my wrist, dude.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.171
I'm biting my tongue.
I'm not gonna talk.

05:05.238 --> 05:09.509
Do you know
the officer's name?

05:09.575 --> 05:11.544

We should have each other's
backs, first and foremost.

05:17.517 --> 05:19.686
{\an1}You know, it really hurts
my feelings, Gus, because...

05:19.752 --> 05:21.054
He could've stopped you.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.189
I told the police multiple
times that their handcuffs

05:23.256 --> 05:25.825
{\an1}were too tight and for you
to talk to me like that.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.794
'Cause you're acting like
you didn't do anything wrong.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.596
{\an5}So, Aimee's claiming that,
you know, she's a victim
of police brutality.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.632
And I come from a long line
of police officers in my family.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.333
And so obviously,
I don't like hearing this.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.602
In this case,
we all saw what happened.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.938
Police brutality is the furthest
thing from what happened here.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.707
And Aimee wants to get
in the car and start claiming

05:40.773 --> 05:43.109
{\an5}she's gonna get this
dude fired because her
handcuffs were too tight

05:43.176 --> 05:45.244
because there's a little bit
of an indention on her wrist.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.713
That don't sit well with me.

05:46.779 --> 05:49.482
Look, I told him the handcuffs
were too tight multiple times.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.017
Look at my wrist.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.453
