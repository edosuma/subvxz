00:00.205 --> 00:03.408
Thomas Malone, convicted for the
murder of Lizzie Kilmuir,

00:03.476 --> 00:04.791
was released this morning.

00:04.893 --> 00:07.080
Why did you go
after Malone in the first place?

00:07.148 --> 00:10.198
He cried like a baby
at Lizzie's funeral. It was odd.

00:10.393 --> 00:12.033
I've withdrawn my
transfer request.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.948
I think whatever decision you made,

00:14.015 --> 00:15.393
I'm just glad you're staying.

00:15.469 --> 00:16.658
Drew McColl called in.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.037
His daughter seems to be
missing.

00:18.104 --> 00:19.658
It looks like she was strangled.

00:19.744 --> 00:21.618
He knows you're too scared
to arrest him again.

00:21.737 --> 00:24.432
He did it then,
and he's done it again!

00:24.713 --> 00:26.838
The daughter of the policeman
that put you in prison

00:26.906 --> 00:28.056
has been found dead.

00:28.124 --> 00:30.526
I couldn't even tell you
what the girl looks like.

00:30.642 --> 00:32.882
I left.
I left her.

00:33.854 --> 00:36.229
Stop it!
Stop it!

00:36.308 --> 00:38.578
The number on the Post-it
was registered to

00:38.646 --> 00:39.732
an Andreas Hagan.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.143
He's a health and safety officer
at Forst Energy.

00:42.211 --> 00:43.721
He's the one saying
Danny was drunk

00:43.797 --> 00:45.617
when his arm got snagged
in the drive shaft.

00:45.685 --> 00:47.533
But it's a barefaced lie.

00:47.616 --> 00:49.924
- You're dead!
- Get out my house!

00:51.287 --> 00:52.643
Bury him!

00:53.178 --> 00:56.607

02:39.588 --> 02:41.791
Have you got
that passenger manifest yet?

02:41.905 --> 02:44.615
Hagan's confirmed as being
on the first flight to Bergen

02:44.689 --> 02:46.759
the morning after
Sally's murder.

02:47.337 --> 02:49.115
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.373
How did you go on at the Taj?

02:51.441 --> 02:54.181
Alan kicked off
when someone jumped the queue.

02:54.268 --> 02:57.088
But apart from not eating
his takeaway, not much to report.

02:57.334 --> 02:58.854
How are we doing?

02:59.828 --> 03:02.775
Well... there's a possibility that

03:02.843 --> 03:05.134
her murder could be
connected to

03:05.345 --> 03:07.767
an article that Sally was
working on.

03:08.142 --> 03:11.197
It looks like she was going to
accuse Forst Energy

03:11.291 --> 03:12.736
of corporate manslaughter,

03:12.804 --> 03:15.080
so... we'd really like
to speak to

03:15.148 --> 03:17.502
their safety officer,
Andreas Hagan.

03:17.570 --> 03:19.155
But he's AWOL in Norway.

03:20.554 --> 03:23.124
Tosh is going to talk to Forst
Energy this morning

03:23.270 --> 03:25.491
and see if we can track
his movements.

03:25.890 --> 03:27.632
You looking at Alan Killick?

03:28.187 --> 03:32.046
He thought that
Sally was having an affair, so...

03:33.835 --> 03:35.484
Drew is not the only one
who's going

03:35.552 --> 03:37.866
to take a lot of convincing
that Malone didn't do this.

03:37.934 --> 03:40.859
It would be very neat
if Thomas Malone did it,

03:40.927 --> 03:42.991
but all three of them have a motive.

03:44.788 --> 03:46.390
With you in a minute.

03:48.137 --> 03:49.827
I'm a free man, eh?

03:55.929 --> 03:57.378
Here.

03:57.851 --> 03:59.570
Get some heat in you.

04:12.626 --> 04:15.257
If somebody hurt you,
I want to know about it.

04:17.327 --> 04:19.898
- They think I killed Sally McColl.
- Mm-hm.

04:20.788 --> 04:22.343
And YOU do.

04:22.770 --> 04:24.650
I'm trying to keep an open mind.

04:26.046 --> 04:28.716
You don't make it easy,
when Gail gives you a false alibi

04:28.784 --> 04:30.504
for the night Sally died.

04:32.365 --> 04:34.717
Maybe she thought you wouldnae
believe the truth.

04:35.163 --> 04:37.327
You've got an answer for everything,
haven't you?

04:37.726 --> 04:39.757
The reason I gave you my card

04:39.856 --> 04:41.648
was because I wanted to help you,

04:41.796 --> 04:44.812
cos you sat for years
in a prison cell,

04:45.028 --> 04:47.178
and the only thing you had to do
to get paroled

04:47.268 --> 04:48.679
was to admit you were guilty.

04:48.945 --> 04:51.726
The fact you couldnae bring yourself
to do that,

04:51.912 --> 04:54.929
that means something to me.
But don't push it.

04:57.788 --> 05:01.546
They put a hood
on my head

05:02.398 --> 05:06.405
and they...
threw me in the back of a van.

05:07.748 --> 05:12.778
And when I wouldn't confess to
killing Lizzie or Sally,

05:13.280 --> 05:15.046
they knocked me out...

05:16.742 --> 05:18.462
.. and they buried me alive.

05:20.796 --> 05:22.570
Any idea who it was?

05:22.920 --> 05:25.984
Mmmm.
Mmm.

05:26.858 --> 05:28.378
You going to tell me?

05:30.083 --> 05:32.003
I'll not be pressing charges.

05:38.093 --> 05:42.288
Billy, we're looking for
a high-roof transit van

05:42.515 --> 05:46.578
on the road between Malone's farm
and Laxo last night.

05:46.710 --> 05:48.734
- I'll get on it.
- See whoever did this?

05:48.802 --> 05:50.155
We go after them hard.

05:50.223 --> 05:53.109
I want everybody to know that
Thomas Malone is off limits.

05:53.177 --> 05:54.281
Understood.

05:54.349 --> 05:56.659
And get Sandy to check out the site
where he was buried.

05:56.727 --> 06:00.609
He's up at Jo Halley's place...
She thinks someone's staking it out.

06:02.138 --> 06:04.018
Right, I'll go and
check it out myself.

06:05.108 --> 06:06.698
Can you see the scratches?

06:06.984 --> 06:08.738
Could have been a polecat, maybe?

06:09.132 --> 06:12.351
A polecat didn't open the gate,
or knock over the plant pots!

06:12.676 --> 06:14.058
And the last couple of nights

06:14.126 --> 06:16.257
I saw lights going up and down
the old track.

06:18.955 --> 06:21.702
I wouldn't be calling
if I didn't think it was important.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.991
Look, I understand you're concerned,
after what happened to Sally,

06:27.059 --> 06:29.109
but try not to think the worst
all the time.

06:29.275 --> 06:31.523
If you get a look at this vehicle,
you let me know.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.093
Can't you have a car parked
at the bottom of the road?

06:35.168 --> 06:38.671
Just make sure you're taking
the usual security precautions.

06:38.897 --> 06:40.533
Which you are.

08:08.828 --> 08:10.226
Have you news?

08:11.155 --> 08:12.435
Has there been a development?

08:12.503 --> 08:14.632
Oh, no, nothing major,
I'm afraid.

08:15.015 --> 08:17.166
Actually, I was wondering
if you could tell me

08:17.234 --> 08:19.218
a wee bit about Alan Killick.

08:19.367 --> 08:22.984
I don't know why you'd be looking at him,
when Malone's around?

08:25.262 --> 08:27.406
I... It's just...

08:28.428 --> 08:32.054
The time his mother said he got home
the night Sally was attacked

08:32.238 --> 08:34.628
doesnae quite match
his actual movements.

08:34.851 --> 08:36.695
Are we talking a big difference?

08:36.841 --> 08:38.760
Half an hour one way or the other
doesn't matter.

08:38.828 --> 08:41.437
It takes longer than that
to get to Fladdabister and back.

08:43.115 --> 08:47.890
Er, and there's just one more
question, if you don't mind.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.747
Thomas Malone's been
attacked again.

08:53.508 --> 08:56.242
So I have to ask you
where were you last night?

08:57.181 --> 09:01.046
It's just procedure, Drew.
Given the fact you were involved last time.

09:03.004 --> 09:04.420
I was here.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.554
Was anybody else with you?

09:11.960 --> 09:14.418
Donna Killick dropped around
for a while. She's a good friend.

09:14.538 --> 09:16.234
She left around ten.

09:17.303 --> 09:18.898
Does that get me off your hook?

09:21.358 --> 09:22.671
OK.

09:23.553 --> 09:25.108
I'll leave you to it.

09:36.413 --> 09:37.741
He knows I'm lying.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.202
This is ridiculous.

09:39.553 --> 09:41.350
I should have told him
the truth.

09:45.605 --> 09:47.125
Thank you.

10:00.788 --> 10:02.148
Hey, Alan?

10:03.884 --> 10:05.296
I need to talk to you.

10:07.616 --> 10:10.462
I have to ask you again,
what time did you get home

10:10.530 --> 10:12.214
- the night Sally died?
- I dunno.

10:12.282 --> 10:14.123
- Whatever my mum said.
- Yeah, she said wrong.

10:14.191 --> 10:15.701
That's why I'm asking you.

10:16.913 --> 10:19.038
I wasn't keeping
my eye on the clock.

10:21.686 --> 10:24.378
I went for a takeaway,
went home, crashed out.

10:24.647 --> 10:26.538
I hear you weren't in
a great frame of mind?

10:27.124 --> 10:29.178
You got in an argument
with somebody...

10:30.788 --> 10:32.921
.. and then didn't even eat
the takeaway?

10:33.741 --> 10:35.389
You binned it.

10:35.881 --> 10:37.967
I didn't have that
much of an appetite.

10:38.983 --> 10:40.360
How come?

10:40.655 --> 10:42.738
I drank too much, I suppose.

10:43.168 --> 10:44.517
You see, a cynic might argue

10:44.585 --> 10:47.038
that you were trying to
give yourself an alibi.

10:49.553 --> 10:51.553
I'm not finished yet.

11:03.436 --> 11:05.163
I know you're grieving,

11:06.022 --> 11:09.061
and I know that we all deal with
that stuff in our own way.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.578
But you have to answer my questions.

11:11.991 --> 11:15.468
- Sorry. It's...
- I know. Shall we just do this?

11:17.756 --> 11:18.860
Yep.

11:18.966 --> 11:20.788
Where were you last night?

11:23.852 --> 11:25.972
I was here, on my own.

11:27.468 --> 11:31.575
I watched a film...
and then went to my bed.

11:32.504 --> 11:35.036
Can you open the doors
of that van for me?

11:51.919 --> 11:55.013
I'm gonnae want forensics to come
up and have a look at that.

11:55.301 --> 11:57.535
In the meantime, I'll take the keys.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.849
Hi, I'm here to see your head
of Human Resources.

12:13.052 --> 12:14.852
Appointment?

12:15.684 --> 12:18.554
DS McIntosh.
Don't need one.

12:29.948 --> 12:31.268
Cass?

12:32.791 --> 12:35.987
Cass! There's a face only
a father could love!

12:36.143 --> 12:37.565
What do you want?

12:40.924 --> 12:45.036
- You need a job.
- In a newspaper?

12:45.104 --> 12:48.385
Well, I could have e-mailed you
a link to a recruitment site,

12:48.463 --> 12:50.666
but then I would have missed
this vision of loveliness.

12:51.885 --> 12:55.188
- So how're you doing, anyway?
- Don't ask.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.680
Thought for the day. You can't
control how others treat you,

13:00.748 --> 13:03.248
but you can control
how you react to it.

13:04.323 --> 13:06.529
You been at the
self-help shelf again?

13:06.981 --> 13:08.302
Come on, give it a bash.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.287
It's not as if you're up to anything
else today.

13:10.453 --> 13:13.607
Actually, I am. Today, like every
other day since my life ended,

13:13.675 --> 13:15.875
I'm going to be stalking Edison
online.

13:19.592 --> 13:22.834
I'm sorry. Edison! I mean,
what kind of name's that, anyway?

13:22.928 --> 13:27.654
- Not helpful.
- I'm sorry. Sorry!

13:29.411 --> 13:30.921
Detective McIntosh?

13:30.998 --> 13:35.092
Sorry for the delay. Had to have
a hunt for Mr Hagan's HR file.

13:35.287 --> 13:37.409
He, er, he normally works
out of our Norway office.

13:38.221 --> 13:41.211
That's funny.
They had it the other way round.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.125
- Is that everything?
- Mr Hagan was due in Bergen yesterday,

13:44.193 --> 13:46.959
but he didn't show.
Do you know where he is?

13:47.412 --> 13:50.053
It's possible
he had some leave to take.

13:50.948 --> 13:52.268
Could you find out?

13:55.225 --> 13:58.338
To be honest, I don't actually
have much contact with Mr Hagan.

13:58.467 --> 14:00.858
Too busy writing his reports,
I imagine.

14:00.998 --> 14:03.725
Like the one
he wrote about Danny Hamilton.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.068
Mr Hamilton died when his arm was
ripped off by a rotating driveshaft

14:08.136 --> 14:09.581
- on one of your rigs.
- Last night

14:09.649 --> 14:13.873
Mr Hagan filed a request
for five days' annual leave.

14:14.787 --> 14:15.858
Does it say where he went?

14:15.975 --> 14:18.188
We don't tend to ask.

14:19.654 --> 14:21.738
Do you know Sally McColl?

14:21.998 --> 14:25.068
She was at your company's
charity ball a few weeks ago?

14:25.670 --> 14:27.519
That's entirely possible.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.014
Would she have met
Mr Hagan there?

14:30.251 --> 14:32.303
If he was invited, perhaps.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.529
Now, I'm gonnae need to
see the guest list.

14:34.659 --> 14:37.360
Plus a copy of the report
that Mr Hagan wrote

14:37.428 --> 14:40.295
exonerating Forst Energy
for Danny Hamilton's accident.

14:40.363 --> 14:43.428
And a record of all the routine
drug and alcohol tests

14:43.496 --> 14:46.564
carried out on Danny Hamilton's rig
in the last year.

14:47.481 --> 14:49.392
And I'm gonnae need them today.

14:57.056 --> 15:00.548
Cassie? Cass?

15:18.259 --> 15:22.079
I'm looking for Donna Killick...
The woman who runs the sanctuary?

15:23.189 --> 15:26.579
- She's not here.
- It's just that...

15:26.665 --> 15:28.322
I saw her advert in the Chronicle.

15:28.546 --> 15:30.775
- Looking for volunteers?
- This isn't a good time.

15:30.843 --> 15:33.032
- When would be?
- Just... not now.

15:35.148 --> 15:37.095
Only, I cycled all the way up here.

15:37.259 --> 15:39.485
The advert said you could just show
up during opening hours, I didn't...

15:39.553 --> 15:42.978
Can you just go, please?
Just leave.

15:44.115 --> 15:45.555
Are you OK?

15:52.154 --> 15:53.994
It's OK.

16:00.681 --> 16:02.298
Mrs Hamilton?

16:02.673 --> 16:04.548
It's me... DS McIntosh.

16:04.616 --> 16:05.736
I'm in a rush.

16:05.804 --> 16:08.515
OK, but I need you to make
that statement we talked about.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.776
- I'm sorry.
- Just repeat what you said the other day,

16:10.843 --> 16:12.790
about Andreas Hagan's
safety report?

16:12.915 --> 16:15.353
How he lied about the cause
of your husband's accident?

16:15.697 --> 16:17.704
He didn't lie.
The report was right.

16:17.903 --> 16:21.361
But you said Hagan blamed alcohol,
and your husband was teetotal?

16:21.429 --> 16:23.556
Danny spent half his life
in the middle of the North Sea.

16:23.623 --> 16:25.270
How would I know if he had
a drink problem?

16:25.338 --> 16:26.892
- You're his wife!
- Widow!

16:27.111 --> 16:29.165
And dead men
don't bring home a wage.

16:29.314 --> 16:32.072
- How much did they pay you?
- Don't you dare judge me!

16:33.245 --> 16:35.720
Look, Danny didn't drink,
but he wasn't a saint.

16:36.016 --> 16:39.108
There is nothing left
for me and the kids.

16:39.514 --> 16:41.499
- And with no insurance pay-out...
- You take that money and

16:41.566 --> 16:43.378
Forst get away with
corporate homicide!

16:43.446 --> 16:45.742
If conditions on that rig
are as bad as Danny claimed,

16:45.810 --> 16:47.480
more men could die.

16:47.892 --> 16:50.447
Look, I'm sorry. I'm out.

17:25.904 --> 17:27.178
Thomas!

17:28.357 --> 17:30.022
Jeez, it's like a freezer in here!

17:30.090 --> 17:32.834
I've still got to get
the generator going.

17:34.628 --> 17:36.264
Does your daughter want to come in?

17:36.332 --> 17:38.772
Well, that's partly
why I wanted to see you.

17:40.943 --> 17:42.911
The incident at the bus stop?

17:43.293 --> 17:45.404
You scared the wits out of her.

17:46.162 --> 17:47.578
I didn't mean to.

17:47.826 --> 17:49.412
Well, maybe

17:50.014 --> 17:53.147
you need to think about
how you're coming across?

17:56.381 --> 17:58.248
Maybe smarten up a bit.

17:58.756 --> 18:05.068
Unless you're... trying for the
Charles Manson look deliberately?

18:10.240 --> 18:13.936
Well, while I'm giving unwanted advice,
what about getting a job?

18:15.475 --> 18:16.998
Who would want me?

18:17.788 --> 18:19.303
Not everyone's against you.

18:19.371 --> 18:23.920
Well, someone sent some lads round
here last night to bury me alive.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.623
Who would do that?

18:25.988 --> 18:27.529
I don't know.

18:30.293 --> 18:31.560
Is that food?

18:31.686 --> 18:33.378
Aye. Chilli. Eat it while it's hot.

18:33.451 --> 18:34.865
OK. - Well,

18:34.967 --> 18:36.967
get that generator fixed,
yeah?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.738
Aye. Aye, I will do.

19:01.487 --> 19:03.515
A farmer out by Malone's place
spotted

19:03.583 --> 19:06.421
a van driving along a track
at three in the morning.

19:06.883 --> 19:08.338
The owner's been traced.

19:08.461 --> 19:12.094
He says he sold the van yesterday
to a garage down by the harbour.

19:12.294 --> 19:14.773
Proprietor, Mr Benny Ray.

19:16.414 --> 19:18.305
So I'm presuming
that's the same Benny Ray

19:18.373 --> 19:20.213
that was a witness at
Malone's trial?

19:21.273 --> 19:23.063
OK, get up there and talk to him.

19:23.242 --> 19:26.061
Also, Jo Halley has been in
touch again... she mentioned

19:26.129 --> 19:30.766
something about a vehicle churning
up some old tracks out by her croft?

19:31.908 --> 19:33.398
See if you can get a tyre print.

19:33.469 --> 19:34.520
Sure.

19:34.588 --> 19:36.523
Someone's bought off Meg Hamilton.

19:36.591 --> 19:38.438
I ran into her
at the Forst Energy offices.

19:38.565 --> 19:41.395
She backtracked on everything
she said about Danny's accident.

19:41.508 --> 19:43.058
She was also holding
an envelope

19:43.148 --> 19:45.938
that was a hell of a lot thicker
than Hagan's personnel file.

19:46.068 --> 19:47.935
I had to provide more
information than that

19:48.003 --> 19:49.716
when I wanted to join
the Brownies.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.778
Forst are hiding something.

19:52.068 --> 19:54.338
The emergency contact,
who's she?

19:54.552 --> 19:56.458
The landlady of his place
on Whalsay,

19:56.508 --> 20:00.161
who hasn't seen Hagan since the
last house inspection a year ago.

20:03.489 --> 20:05.232
I've finished the filing.

20:05.974 --> 20:08.716
You know, you should really
think about going paperless.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.578
So, I-I brought you a coffee.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.618
I'll stick it down here,

20:13.943 --> 20:15.552
for when you're ready.

20:20.028 --> 20:21.748
Hey, listen. Um...

20:27.896 --> 20:29.338
Sorry about before.

20:30.075 --> 20:31.308
I feel like a right dick.

20:31.376 --> 20:34.310
I can't believe I didn't make the
connection between you and Sally McColl.

20:34.378 --> 20:36.270
The last thing you need right now is
someone rocking up,

20:36.337 --> 20:38.103
wanting to play with
the baby seals.

20:39.068 --> 20:41.794
I'm glad you came up today.

20:43.988 --> 20:46.739
I'm not really on top of things
and

20:47.798 --> 20:49.559
I don't know when I will be.

20:50.748 --> 20:52.785
If you could stay
for a few more days?

20:53.644 --> 20:55.128
Sure.

20:55.285 --> 20:57.503
Sorry,
we're closed for visitors today.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.683
It's fine, Mum.
She's a volunteer.

20:59.909 --> 21:02.470
She's gonnae help out round here
until things get back to normal.

21:02.618 --> 21:04.863
Hi. I'm Cass.
Cassie Perez.

21:05.011 --> 21:06.261
The policeman's daughter?

21:06.410 --> 21:08.089
Yeah. That's right.

21:09.207 --> 21:11.121
Erm... I best get back.

21:58.928 --> 22:00.443
Can I help?

22:01.592 --> 22:04.178
DC Wilson. Police.

22:06.849 --> 22:09.568
- Is this your digger?
- No.

22:11.410 --> 22:15.154
I'm looking for a transit van
that was sold for scrap yesterday.

22:15.607 --> 22:18.685
You've just missed it.
It's off to the crusher.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.059
You ever been one of my customers?

22:22.188 --> 22:23.334
No.

22:24.881 --> 22:26.538
I need to talk to your guys.

22:26.654 --> 22:28.045
Individually.

22:28.779 --> 22:31.375
I'm going to need to
know where they were last night.

22:31.443 --> 22:32.670
We were all together.

22:32.828 --> 22:34.115
Few drinks.

22:34.670 --> 22:36.818
We had a wee party to ourselves.

22:37.537 --> 22:38.897
Which pub?

22:40.168 --> 22:41.848
We got a carry out.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.818
Do you think Cass'll leave?

22:56.068 --> 22:57.459
I don't know.

22:57.615 --> 23:01.076
Duncan reckons if she stays, she's
gonnae be selling herself sort.

23:01.396 --> 23:02.771
Like me, you mean?

23:03.624 --> 23:05.388
No, you did the right thing.

23:06.188 --> 23:07.428
You think?

23:08.224 --> 23:11.348
Aye, you'd hate the white pudding
suppers in Edinburgh.

23:45.399 --> 23:47.803
Still can't get used to
people doing that.

24:01.278 --> 24:02.796
Considering Hagan is Norwegian,

24:02.864 --> 24:05.788
I was hoping for
something a bit more hygge.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.812
Is that a Norwegian thing?
Or is it Danish?

24:08.913 --> 24:11.876
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:11.944 --> 24:13.593
Yeah, you do. It's that cosy thing

24:13.668 --> 24:16.269
the Scandinavians do
to get through the long winter.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.388
It means the complete absence
of anything annoying.

24:20.295 --> 24:24.215
Yeah, unfortunately, that's not
a concept I'm familiar with.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.288
Sir?

24:32.704 --> 24:34.384
Think this is Hagan?

24:36.085 --> 24:39.077
Take a snap shot, see if
the landlady can ID him.

24:52.588 --> 24:54.851
It proves that Sally
was in contact with Hagan.

24:54.976 --> 24:57.280
Yeah, but we're gonnae
need more than that.

24:57.773 --> 24:59.460
How did you go on at the garage?

25:00.226 --> 25:01.869
Benny gave me
some cock and bull

25:01.937 --> 25:04.138
about him and his lads going
drinking last night.

25:04.468 --> 25:08.046
However, the tyre tracks
up at Jo Halley's?

25:08.114 --> 25:11.023
They are a match for the ones
at the Malone burial site.

25:11.348 --> 25:14.458
So much for Jo Halley
being a paranoid fantasist.

25:14.668 --> 25:16.418
- I never said she was.
- You don't have to.

25:16.468 --> 25:18.349
It's all over your face
every time you talk to her.

25:18.416 --> 25:19.879
OK, come on!

25:20.856 --> 25:23.178
I need more on Benny Ray,
so ask around.

25:23.228 --> 25:24.637
Billy, what's the matter?

25:24.769 --> 25:26.679
I just had DNA Database on the line.

25:26.747 --> 25:28.857
The sample of DNA
we took from Alan Killick...

25:28.925 --> 25:30.035
Yeah, what about it?

25:30.103 --> 25:32.637
It's a partial match
for the secondary DNA

25:32.793 --> 25:35.918
found on the scarf
used to strangle Lizzie Kilmuir.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.720
Which would mean that

25:42.788 --> 25:45.796
our unknown suspect would have to be
related to Alan Killick.

25:45.992 --> 25:48.192
Yeah, on the male side, aye.

25:50.202 --> 25:53.303
Well, that narrows things down
quite a bit, doesn't it?

26:10.628 --> 26:11.749
Hello?

26:11.868 --> 26:15.866
We're closed to visitors today,
but I can take a donation?

26:16.415 --> 26:18.055
What are you doing here?

26:19.546 --> 26:22.280
Duncan thought I needed something
to take my mind off being dumped,

26:22.348 --> 26:24.014
so I'm volunteering!

26:24.086 --> 26:25.616
This was Duncan's idea?

26:26.458 --> 26:28.077
Detective Perez?

26:31.147 --> 26:33.702
I'll take you home when I'm done.
I want a word.

26:33.789 --> 26:35.699
I said I'd help out with
the evening routine.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.655
OK, we'll talk tonight, then.

26:40.778 --> 26:44.678
Alan's DNA is on that scarf?
That's impossible.

26:45.928 --> 26:47.782
He wasn't even born
when Lizzie was murdered.

26:47.850 --> 26:49.592
No. I said a partial match.

26:50.152 --> 26:53.982
Which means that DNA belongs to
a direct male relative.

26:54.483 --> 26:56.530
Father, grandfather,
so on down the line.

26:56.598 --> 26:58.553
Alan's father was an only child.

26:58.733 --> 27:02.889
And old man Killick and his brothers
were long dead when that girl died.

27:03.506 --> 27:05.232
So it must have been my dad?

27:08.388 --> 27:10.483
You think Kevin killed
Lizzie Kilmuir?

27:10.668 --> 27:12.014
I can't rule it out.

27:12.221 --> 27:15.694
Until I can get a sample of his DNA
so we can cross-check.

27:16.468 --> 27:22.366
Do you have anything of Kevin's?
An old toothbrush, a comb...

27:22.455 --> 27:23.695
No.

27:27.090 --> 27:28.577
He's been dead eight years.

27:28.694 --> 27:31.178
No-one keeps their partner's
belongings that long.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.163
Maybe your marriage
was happier than mine.

27:39.028 --> 27:44.514
If we can't get a sample of DNA,
then we would have to disintern.

27:44.676 --> 27:46.596
So what, you want to dig up
his grave?

27:47.788 --> 27:49.733
I take it
you need our permission for that?

27:49.801 --> 27:51.191
Because it's not happening.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.120
Given the gravity of the situation,

27:53.233 --> 27:56.788
we would get permission eventually
with or without your consent.

28:00.374 --> 28:03.796
Oh, what's the point...
Just let 'em get on with it.

28:06.553 --> 28:08.388
Mrs Killick, can you see me out?

28:16.825 --> 28:19.483
Er... Drew's not doing so good.

28:20.628 --> 28:22.338
He said you dropped over last night?

28:22.388 --> 28:23.708
Just for an hour or so.

28:25.647 --> 28:28.018
But yet you didnae get back
until the wee small hours?

28:28.068 --> 28:30.710
I went for a drive.
I lost track of time.

28:32.241 --> 28:34.218
So what about the night
that Sally got killed?

28:34.374 --> 28:36.671
Did you lose track of time
that night as well?

28:37.124 --> 28:39.994
Cos we know that Alan wasnae here
when you said he was.

28:40.068 --> 28:41.898
Is that why you sent your daughter
up here?

28:41.983 --> 28:43.327
To spy on us?

28:43.926 --> 28:46.364
No, I didnae send my daughter
up here.

28:47.543 --> 28:48.825
Believe me.

29:39.388 --> 29:41.020
I just wanted
to let you know that

29:41.088 --> 29:43.793
there was some activity
up here last night,

29:43.997 --> 29:47.231
but it was connected to a crime
somewhere elsewhere on the island.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.012
You weren't the target.

29:50.948 --> 29:53.058
People think I'm paranoid.

29:53.803 --> 29:55.243
I'm not.

29:57.934 --> 30:01.692
You and Alan and Sally look like you
were pretty close?

30:03.403 --> 30:05.203
We got on well.

30:06.228 --> 30:08.668
Did Alan stay over here much?

30:09.707 --> 30:11.442
A few nights a week.

30:13.030 --> 30:14.590
You OK with that?

30:16.801 --> 30:19.317
He could have stayed more,
I wouldn't have minded.

30:23.926 --> 30:25.840
Can you have a look at this for me?

30:26.673 --> 30:30.340
Does that look like the man Sally
was talking to at the festival?

30:32.051 --> 30:35.754
I think maybe he was younger,
but I can't be sure.

30:39.575 --> 30:41.684
Are you sure that they were
speaking Norwegian?

30:42.028 --> 30:43.778
Well, I don't speak it much,

30:43.846 --> 30:46.338
but I lip read
so I know the shape of the language.

30:46.497 --> 30:51.207
Erm... He was denying something.
You know, with his hands up.

30:59.012 --> 31:00.997
That's the stuff in from
Forst Energy.

31:01.145 --> 31:02.754
Hagan was at the charity ball,

31:02.864 --> 31:06.304
and Danny Hamilton mysteriously
managed to avoid every single

31:06.372 --> 31:09.458
random drug and alcohol test
in the two years before his death.

31:09.590 --> 31:12.114
Right, so they've just wiped him
from the records?

31:12.182 --> 31:15.106
How else could Hagan claim
a tea-total man was an alcoholic?

31:15.317 --> 31:16.434
Sir?

31:16.557 --> 31:21.184
I was checking to see if Kevin Killick had
any kind of record and I found these.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.180
Jesus!

31:23.308 --> 31:26.418
Donna Killick logged
several reports of assault

31:27.512 --> 31:29.793
but she always withdrew
the charges.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.867
Right, so she protected him, then.

31:34.988 --> 31:38.754
She won't give a DNA sample now,
so she's protecting him still.

31:39.808 --> 31:40.935
Why?

31:41.003 --> 31:44.293
Some victims can form a bond
with their abuser.

32:17.067 --> 32:18.137
Sorry.

32:18.309 --> 32:21.387
It's all right. I understand.

32:22.303 --> 32:24.054
You know, I was thinking

32:24.122 --> 32:25.311
- maybe you should....
- Don't suggest

32:25.379 --> 32:28.348
a silent retreat
unless you're wearing a stab vest.

32:30.325 --> 32:33.567
No, I was thinking
more along the ways of a night off.

32:33.926 --> 32:37.661
Or... see some of your pals?

32:39.151 --> 32:42.114
But whatever you need...
just ask.

33:15.501 --> 33:18.399
You said to come back
if I was struggling?

33:20.201 --> 33:22.761
Well, I'm not.

33:23.899 --> 33:28.587
Struggling. I'm... coping really,
really well.

33:31.428 --> 33:35.805
I know that
because I... watch myself all the time.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.102
To be sure

33:40.719 --> 33:43.228
that I'm not letting...

33:44.467 --> 33:50.507
.. what he did
change my behaviour

33:50.640 --> 33:52.241
or...

33:53.694 --> 33:59.538
alter my choices or
define me.

34:02.718 --> 34:06.296
24/7, I'm
keeping it together.

34:10.351 --> 34:12.295
And it's exhausting.

34:25.148 --> 34:29.748
Benny Ray. Ah, Shetland's answer
to Liam Gallagher.

34:30.038 --> 34:31.087
He had terrible hair!

34:31.155 --> 34:35.418
I mean, I know we all did back then,
but his was just spectacular.

34:35.467 --> 34:37.058
I can't place him. - No?

34:37.108 --> 34:40.357
But then I wasn't really in the same
crowd as you and Lizzie back then.

34:40.623 --> 34:44.335
No. Oh, you mind when, erm, me
and Liz finally let you come to

34:44.404 --> 34:47.101
one of our house-parties and
you puked all over my mum's sofa?

34:47.170 --> 34:49.146
Jesus. Happy days!

34:50.606 --> 34:52.101
Until Lizzie.

34:52.661 --> 34:55.021
Aye. The day the music died.

34:57.099 --> 34:58.738
Did she know Benny well?

34:58.927 --> 35:00.497
I don't think so.

35:00.788 --> 35:04.318
Mind you, she did talk about having
an older man, so you never know.

35:04.390 --> 35:05.700
Seriously?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.359
Of course not, you idiot.

35:07.427 --> 35:09.304
Jeez! I think someone
did take him on.

35:09.372 --> 35:11.919
He's got a couple of grandkids,
or maybe one.

35:17.989 --> 35:19.771
- Be careful.
- Hm?

35:19.927 --> 35:22.435
With Malone.
Don't get too involved.

35:24.527 --> 35:25.887
I won't.

35:28.381 --> 35:31.691
- I don't see the problem.
- You don't? Really?

35:31.935 --> 35:34.036
The Killick family are smack
in the middle of

35:34.104 --> 35:36.114
a murder investigation,
that's the problem.

35:36.182 --> 35:37.956
You honestly think
he'd kill his girlfriend?

35:38.068 --> 35:39.911
He runs a wildlife sanctuary!

35:40.021 --> 35:43.291
Right, and-and Hitler
was a vegetarian.

35:43.428 --> 35:44.458
I like it up there, OK?

35:44.508 --> 35:46.572
For the first time in ages,
I didn't spend the day

35:46.640 --> 35:48.828
thinking about Edison
and feeling like an idiot.

35:48.896 --> 35:50.766
And tomorrow's going to be even
better.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.050
Alan's taking me to Unst.

35:52.118 --> 35:54.050
He's what? What,
just the two of you?

35:54.118 --> 35:56.360
Yeah, someone reported a couple
of beached seals on the shoreline.

35:56.427 --> 35:57.985
We're going to catch
the early ferry.

35:58.079 --> 36:00.071
Is there anything else
for the rubbish?

36:00.650 --> 36:03.440
Wait! Cass, Cass, wait, Come here.

36:04.321 --> 36:05.694
You're not going there with him.

36:05.762 --> 36:08.220
Do you not think I'm a bit old
to be ordered about, Dad?

36:08.412 --> 36:11.423
OK, just imagine for a second
that I'm a police officer

36:11.508 --> 36:15.274
and I'm advising you for your own
safety that Alan Killick

36:15.368 --> 36:17.898
is a person of interest
in a murder investigation,

36:18.079 --> 36:20.141
which means that
he's not in the clear yet,

36:20.268 --> 36:21.712
and until such times as he is,

36:21.780 --> 36:23.930
you are advised not to
be on your own with him.

36:24.085 --> 36:25.965
How's that? Is that OK?

36:37.278 --> 36:38.595
Cass?

36:39.577 --> 36:42.470
He was just standing there,
looking into the house.

36:44.388 --> 36:45.898
Is there a problem?

36:45.948 --> 36:48.001
You told me to keep in touch, so...

36:49.977 --> 36:52.079
Is it OK if I come in?

36:55.257 --> 36:58.610
And you were worried about me
hanging out with Alan Killick?!

36:59.983 --> 37:01.595
Very nice!

37:06.432 --> 37:09.192
I'll leave you to it. - Uh-huh.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.400
Hm. Hm. That's tasty.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.018
Is that your wee girl, eh?

37:24.086 --> 37:26.006
Aye, Cassie.

37:26.299 --> 37:27.579
Aye.

37:33.288 --> 37:36.298
Er, you know what, Thomas,
this really isn't a great time.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.938
It's nothing important.

37:39.588 --> 37:44.378
I was just walking by and I...
I saw your wee lights on there.

37:44.755 --> 37:46.880
Hm. Hm.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.505
It looks very cosy.

37:57.850 --> 37:59.521
Well, you know.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.098
Maybe once your compensation
comes through,

38:03.148 --> 38:04.896
you can get your place sorted.

38:05.341 --> 38:07.896
You know, I was thinking that
maybe...

38:09.036 --> 38:10.578
you could help me fix it up.

38:11.021 --> 38:12.117
Were you?

38:12.185 --> 38:13.427
Mm-hmm.

38:13.809 --> 38:15.228
I'm gonnae get you a lift home.

38:15.296 --> 38:16.576
OK.

38:18.188 --> 38:20.271
Your family ever visit you
in prison?

38:21.802 --> 38:23.130
In Glasgow?

38:24.966 --> 38:27.068
What about your mum, though?
She visit you?

38:29.638 --> 38:30.778
No.

38:34.630 --> 38:38.028
When you were being held in Shetland,
did she visit you in the station?

38:40.528 --> 38:41.908
Once.

38:43.434 --> 38:44.660
What did you talk about?

38:44.765 --> 38:46.536
She told me it was my own fault.

38:46.732 --> 38:48.498
Because of the way I am with folk.

38:48.548 --> 38:51.774
She told me if I pleaded innocent,
it would be the death of her.

38:51.876 --> 38:55.211
I might as well put the scarf around
her neck and kill her dead, too.

38:58.985 --> 39:01.047
Aye, she told me to confess.

39:01.897 --> 39:04.337
And you always did everything
she told you?

39:06.399 --> 39:08.461
I just wanted her to love me.

39:20.016 --> 39:21.063
Is that yours?

39:21.377 --> 39:22.577
Aye.

40:46.729 --> 40:49.298
- Argh! Ah!
- Jo! It's me. It's Alan.

40:49.707 --> 40:51.307
It's Alan.

40:53.028 --> 40:54.745
You scared me!

40:55.393 --> 41:01.138
I'm sorry. I'm...
I-I-I didn't really feel like talking.

41:01.534 --> 41:03.909
I wanted to spend the night
in Sally's room.

41:05.248 --> 41:06.604
OK.

41:08.057 --> 41:12.112
But next time,
just ring the bell, or text me.

41:12.259 --> 41:13.635
I will.

41:15.572 --> 41:17.052
Do you want a coffee?

41:17.120 --> 41:21.026
If you don't mind
I just need a wee bit of headspace.

41:22.517 --> 41:23.854
Sure.

42:23.638 --> 42:27.388
Morning. Sorry for leaving you
in the cold like that.

42:27.582 --> 42:31.457
Morning. Right, get a hot cup of tea
in us, eh?

42:33.310 --> 42:35.442
You said I should get a job.

42:36.148 --> 42:39.551
I was thinking maybe
I could help you out around here?

42:42.730 --> 42:44.520
How did you know
Sally was cheating?

42:44.637 --> 42:48.856
Did that thing on your phone where
you can find someone's location.

42:48.959 --> 42:54.567
Then she went to Norway for a few days
and lied to me about where she was.

42:54.983 --> 42:57.606
Think she was leave me anyway,
to be honest with you.

43:01.414 --> 43:05.145
You can't keep someone
if they don't want to be with you.

43:08.192 --> 43:09.988
You can't make someone love you.

43:21.254 --> 43:23.299
Looks like the seals
have gone back into the water.

43:23.367 --> 43:25.950
Aye. If they were ever here at all.

43:43.411 --> 43:44.960
One.

43:45.981 --> 43:47.250
Two.

43:47.318 --> 43:49.158
Er...

43:52.691 --> 43:54.303
Coping?

43:54.408 --> 43:56.758
Oh, I'm just about getting there.

43:57.145 --> 43:59.754
You know, there were
guys in the prison who had these,

43:59.822 --> 44:01.598
but I never wanted near one.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.950
- Really?
- There's only one way to smuggle

44:04.018 --> 44:05.413
a phone into a prison,
you know.

44:05.481 --> 44:07.879
OK, thanks. That's a wee bit
too much information.

44:07.947 --> 44:09.177
I'm sorry.

44:09.245 --> 44:11.316
- That's all right.
- Look, I'm going on a coffee run.

44:11.383 --> 44:12.493
What do you want?

44:12.561 --> 44:15.348
Er, white, three sugars?

44:15.924 --> 44:17.793
I'm liking your style.

44:34.145 --> 44:36.583
- Hey, Cora.
- Good morning.

44:37.788 --> 44:39.411
I hear Cass is back.

44:39.628 --> 44:42.637
Aye, dragging her heart behind her.

44:43.028 --> 44:46.239
She'll get over it. We all do.

44:48.950 --> 44:50.497
So what happens now?

44:50.817 --> 44:53.378
We run him to the morgue.
Take a sample.

44:53.606 --> 44:55.153
Whatever's left.

44:56.356 --> 44:58.543
I am sorry to make you do this.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.977
No skin off my nose.

45:02.762 --> 45:07.583
Though there are some who find
the whole process harder to stomach.

45:44.340 --> 45:47.820
- So what do you know about Benny?
- He lives with his grandson.

45:48.200 --> 45:49.598
Just the two of them?

45:50.122 --> 45:54.418
Yeah. Well, his mother died... drugs.

45:55.020 --> 45:57.387
And Benny was a dealer
back in the day?

45:58.690 --> 46:03.981
They used to call him Benny Blue,
and he was arrested more than once.

46:04.770 --> 46:06.262
Never did time?

46:06.637 --> 46:07.637
No.

46:07.793 --> 46:09.411
You thinking what I'm thinking?

46:10.067 --> 46:13.132
Billy, is there a list
anywhere of the informants

46:13.200 --> 46:14.504
we used in the 1990s?

46:14.572 --> 46:17.282
Sure.
It's on the notice board there.

46:17.350 --> 46:19.356
Next to the
Neighbourhood Watch poster.

46:22.465 --> 46:25.658
Can you could ring around and see if there
was ever a Benny Ray on the payroll?

46:25.747 --> 46:26.898
Will do.

46:27.426 --> 46:28.809
Thomas?

46:30.177 --> 46:31.897
I got you...

46:38.745 --> 46:40.025
Oh!

46:53.607 --> 46:55.206
Murderer.

47:01.651 --> 47:06.190
Sally's expenses... Put together, these
are better than a diary. Times, places.

47:06.323 --> 47:10.112
I was able to cross-reference her movements
with security footage from Norway.

47:10.268 --> 47:12.792
This is from her most recent trip
a few weeks ago.

47:12.948 --> 47:16.745
She visited this cafe in Bergen.
Two minutes after she arrived...

47:17.068 --> 47:18.346
Hagan.

47:18.588 --> 47:21.604
They were in there for 23 minutes.
Sally paid the bill.

47:21.748 --> 47:25.362
170 krone
for two lattes and a skoleboller.

47:25.430 --> 47:29.057
It's a wee pastry thing. Possibly made from
solid gold. The prices in Norway are nuts.

47:29.125 --> 47:32.643
No, this is excellent. That's proof
positive that they were in contact,

47:32.749 --> 47:36.549
so get hold of Bergen and tell them
tracking this guy is a priority.

47:37.151 --> 47:39.283
Just got a result
from one of the old boys.

47:39.375 --> 47:40.993
At the time of the Malone trial,

47:41.108 --> 47:43.548
Benny Ray was on Drew McColl's
payroll.

47:58.457 --> 47:59.497
Mr Ray?

48:01.065 --> 48:03.338
I'm DI Perez, Shetland Police.

48:04.112 --> 48:06.635
I wanted to talk to you
about the evidence that you

48:06.792 --> 48:08.658
gave at the trial of Thomas Malone.

48:08.883 --> 48:10.680
I'm picking my grandkid
up from the school.

48:10.748 --> 48:12.354
Yeah, sorry. It won't take long.

48:12.441 --> 48:15.487
You mind telling me again what you
saw that day on the Ferry to Unst?

48:15.613 --> 48:17.104
It was more than 20 years ago!

48:17.172 --> 48:19.772
Well, all the same.

48:20.828 --> 48:23.698
Malone. On a boat.
With his mother's car.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.170
Anything else?

48:25.238 --> 48:26.464
I didn't pay him any attention.

48:26.531 --> 48:28.448
I didn't know
he had a body in the boot.

48:30.385 --> 48:32.206
But you worked for Drew McColl.

48:35.362 --> 48:38.247
Didn't they ever tell you that
as a police informer you shouldn't

48:38.315 --> 48:40.298
have been allowed in that
witness box?

48:40.987 --> 48:43.258
The fact that you were discredits
the whole trial.

48:43.362 --> 48:45.081
All I know is that
if I hadn't spoken up,

48:45.198 --> 48:47.229
that pervert Malone
might have got away with it.

48:47.651 --> 48:49.846
What kind of justice
would that have been?

48:51.284 --> 48:53.208
You know the night before last,

48:53.276 --> 48:55.510
somebody threatened to bury
Thomas Malone alive.

48:56.564 --> 48:58.509
You mind telling me
where you were that night?

48:58.681 --> 49:00.174
Watching the Disney Channel.

49:00.360 --> 49:03.651
You told DC Wilson you were at home
with a carry out with your mates.

49:03.719 --> 49:06.885
Aye. While watching
the Disney Channel.

49:08.628 --> 49:10.088
All right, wee man?

49:10.210 --> 49:12.909
- Is this the figure you wanted?
- Wrong one!

49:13.049 --> 49:15.307
Huh? It can't be!

49:15.893 --> 49:17.651
That the one you're looking for?

49:18.231 --> 49:19.791
Yeah!

49:20.768 --> 49:23.370
Be careful where you drop things.

49:24.878 --> 49:28.258
Did you lie for Drew McColl
about seeing Malone on that boat?

49:28.424 --> 49:29.950
Just like you're lying about now

49:30.018 --> 49:32.057
about putting Malone
in that hole in the ground?

49:32.206 --> 49:35.228
It's a lot of years for perjury,
Benny.

49:46.683 --> 49:49.713
Benny Ray was
an informer on your payroll.

49:49.828 --> 49:51.620
We knew Malone was guilty.

49:51.932 --> 49:53.538
So when Benny came out
and said he'd seen him

49:53.588 --> 49:56.278
on the Unst ferry, the fact
he was an informer was irrelevant.

49:56.346 --> 49:58.612
No, not in the eyes of the law,
it's not!

49:58.698 --> 50:01.418
Sometimes you have to take a chance
to get the right result.

50:01.526 --> 50:03.326
Is that what you were doing
when you persuaded

50:03.393 --> 50:05.268
Malone's mother to pressure him
into confessing?

50:05.335 --> 50:09.218
That's ridiculous! You did what you
had to do to get the conviction,

50:09.385 --> 50:11.549
and hoped you wouldn't live
to regret it.

50:11.617 --> 50:13.792
I don't think you regret a thing.

50:16.167 --> 50:17.956
Don't know how you can say that
to me.

50:18.135 --> 50:20.258
If I hadn't screwed up
the Malone case,

50:20.401 --> 50:22.401
he would never have been released.

50:24.708 --> 50:28.828
And I wouldn't be looking for a picture to
use for my daughter's memorial service.

50:43.055 --> 50:44.961
Norway called.
They've found Hagan.

50:45.063 --> 50:46.578
I thought I'd nip home
and grab a bag.

50:46.688 --> 50:48.742
Unless you'd rather go with Sandy?

50:48.861 --> 50:52.234
Er, no, no.
Hagan's yours.

50:53.844 --> 50:55.656
As long as you're up to it...

50:57.398 --> 50:58.930
The flight's at seven.

50:59.839 --> 51:01.922
OK, then, I'll meet you
at the airport.

51:12.086 --> 51:14.778
Thomas Malone? In the house?
Really?

51:15.297 --> 51:16.594
Aye, for two seconds.

51:16.742 --> 51:19.695
She's a target because of your job,
you do know that?

51:19.868 --> 51:22.602
Who gave her the idea to volunteer
at the Wildlife Sanctuary?

51:22.670 --> 51:25.867
Alan Killick doesn't have an alibi for
the night Sally died, did you know that?

51:25.935 --> 51:27.245
You think Alan was involved?

51:27.313 --> 51:31.938
I'm not sure, but thanks to you,
him and Cass are bosom buddies.

51:34.370 --> 51:36.056
I didn't mean for that to happen,

51:36.124 --> 51:37.439
I-I-I-I was just trying to get her
out of the house.

51:37.506 --> 51:38.976
No, I know.

51:39.201 --> 51:42.570
But she's all grown up
and she's done listening to us,

51:42.898 --> 51:44.883
and we're going to have to
get used to it.

51:45.600 --> 51:47.508
It was easier
when she wasnae here.

51:48.107 --> 51:49.467
I know.

51:52.367 --> 51:54.016
Let me try and talk to her.

51:56.173 --> 51:57.742
Aye, all right.

52:11.558 --> 52:15.760
Tosh, I cannot come with you. Sorry,
something's come up with Cassie.

52:15.828 --> 52:17.537
You're going to meet
a Detective Strom

52:17.605 --> 52:19.928
and she's going to point you
in the direction of Hagan.

52:20.104 --> 52:21.174
All we need to know is

52:21.242 --> 52:24.047
if Hagan was the guy that Jo saw
talking to Sally.

52:24.115 --> 52:26.185
Yeah. Don't worry,
I can handle it.

52:26.308 --> 52:27.668
All right.

52:44.420 --> 52:45.936
There you are.

52:46.811 --> 52:48.468
Are you hungry?

52:52.701 --> 52:57.588
If my dad was a killer,
what does that make me, then?

52:58.788 --> 53:00.631
You're nothing like your father.

53:01.890 --> 53:03.800
Why are you even thinking like that?

53:04.302 --> 53:06.951
I don't want his DNA on that scarf.

53:09.168 --> 53:15.287
Even just the possibility
that he was... a killer...

53:17.828 --> 53:20.348
.. I couldn't... I couldn't bear it.

53:26.633 --> 53:29.365
I'm going to check on Jo,
see if she's OK.

53:36.948 --> 53:39.178
Come on, Thomas,
let me in!

53:41.988 --> 53:43.608
Thomas!

53:44.935 --> 53:46.693
I brought you some food.

53:49.195 --> 53:51.568
I'm not angry about the phone!

53:56.404 --> 53:58.209
Don't shut me out!

54:24.842 --> 54:26.248
How was Unst?

54:26.630 --> 54:27.857
Fine.

54:27.998 --> 54:29.298
There was no stranded seals

54:29.348 --> 54:32.147
but there was a definite sighting
of an undercover cop.

54:36.459 --> 54:38.889
He was supposed to keep
a low profile.

54:39.006 --> 54:41.615
Yeah, well, someone needs to go
back to police academy.

54:42.828 --> 54:46.670
I know you worry about me,
but you don't have to.

54:49.334 --> 54:53.318
What's with the fancy biscuits?
Does that mean I've been forgiven?

54:53.615 --> 54:57.029
No, that means we've got
a visitor on the way.

54:57.389 --> 54:58.395
Who?

54:58.894 --> 55:00.162
Hi, Jimmy.

55:03.410 --> 55:05.520
There's been a development.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.512
Kevin Killick's DNA result
came back.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.090
It doesn't match.

55:11.528 --> 55:14.497
What, it doesn't match
the DNA on the scarf?

55:14.669 --> 55:18.122
It's not even the same
DNA as Alan Killick.

55:18.895 --> 55:20.938
Kevin isn't Alan's father.

55:21.348 --> 55:24.387
We have to assume that Donna
knows who the father is,

55:24.528 --> 55:26.708
and that she's aware
that whoever he is

55:26.879 --> 55:29.254
is a suspect in Lizzie's murder.

55:29.548 --> 55:31.218
So who's she protecting?

55:31.465 --> 55:34.069
I hate to admit it,
but Drew did cross my mind.

55:34.137 --> 55:36.881
He thinks I don't know about him
and Donna, but I've known for years.

55:36.949 --> 55:40.106
No, it's not Drew.
CCRC tested his DNA.

55:40.470 --> 55:43.489
We have to find out who that DNA
belongs to, Jimmy.

55:45.023 --> 55:46.692
Because until we do,

55:47.549 --> 55:51.789
people are gonnae keep assuming
that Malone killed Lizzie.

55:53.268 --> 55:55.426
Have you changed
your opinion about that?

55:58.052 --> 56:01.309
Would it surprise you to hear that
I'm keeping an open mind?

56:03.149 --> 56:04.501
Good.

56:40.068 --> 56:41.575
Hello.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.403
Nah, don't worry.

56:44.090 --> 56:46.638
I'm just waiting on someone
picking up a motor.

56:47.311 --> 56:48.831
Thanks, Pal.

57:07.593 --> 57:08.906
Benny?

57:13.914 --> 57:15.738
You on your own tonight, Benny?

57:16.123 --> 57:17.375
All right?
