00:13.046 --> 00:14.447
{\an8}What, you gonna
call off the engagement?

00:14.514 --> 00:17.784
{\an7}If I can't tell my woman
that she shouldn't be somewhere

00:17.851 --> 00:19.152
{\an8}without her going anyway,

00:19.219 --> 00:21.087
{\an8}we have a serious
misunderstanding.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.656
{\an7}Now, go on, play with me and,

{\an8}Bitch, what?

00:37.971 --> 00:39.038
{\an8}Don't call me no bitch.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.840
{\an8}First off,
I wanna tell you,

00:40.907 --> 00:44.344
{\an7}Lyrica's mother,
she's a bitch, a real bitch.

00:44.411 --> 00:46.579
{\an7}(A1)
I have a gender reveal
coming up.

00:46.646 --> 00:50.784
{\an7}Like, can you at least
get along with her for that?

00:50.850 --> 00:52.385
{\an7}I'm not used to being
around you.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.054
{\an7}Instead of trying to be
a full-time dad,

00:55.121 --> 00:56.723
{\an8}maybe she'd like it better--

00:55.121 --> 00:56.723
{\an8}Be a part-time.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.958
{\an8}--as a part-time--

00:56.790 --> 00:58.958
{\an8}Part-time father,
yes, part-time.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.326
{\an7}You don't need to know
nothing about her contract.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.428
{\an8}You ain't got no money.

01:01.494 --> 01:04.230
{\an8}How do you know
I'm the father?

01:04.297 --> 01:08.401
{\an8}So, my dad, he did tell me
that he popped up on you.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.471
{\an7}Yeah. Let's not talk
about your dad, please.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.339

behind you,

01:13.406 --> 01:14.908
{\an7}so we gonna do

outta here quicker,

01:16.342 --> 01:20.413
{\an7}but if you have to stay
the 30 days, just stay down.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.284
{\an8}I was accused of being
a credit card thief.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.986
{\an7}(tearfully)
And for people to keep
bringing this (bleep) up...

01:27.053 --> 01:28.621
{\an8}like it's nothing.

01:28.688 --> 01:30.957
{\an8}This is almost $300!
This is the proof!
This is everything!

01:31.024 --> 01:32.325

02:29.649 --> 02:31.584
The real K.?
Keyshia Cole?

02:31.651 --> 02:33.586
I had to reach out to him
to get into shape

02:33.653 --> 02:35.188
and plus
he's not gonna charge me.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.224
{\an1}Yeah, left...
(laughing)

02:38.291 --> 02:40.026

02:40.093 --> 02:42.262
{\an1}It's good seeing you,

02:42.328 --> 02:44.230
{\an5}I know-- feel like I don't
ever get to see you.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.230

02:45.932 --> 02:48.334
{\an8}I mean, well, after the other

02:48.401 --> 02:49.903
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.903
{\an8}--dead for real.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.572
{\an1}I know that we, uh, we've been
going through the paperwork

02:52.639 --> 02:53.706

02:53.773 --> 02:55.775
Just wanna make sure
that we handle it

02:55.842 --> 02:57.877

02:57.944 --> 03:02.015

03:02.081 --> 03:04.450
{\an5}Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:02.081 --> 03:04.450
And then she came in,
it was just, like...

03:04.517 --> 03:06.753
{\an1}we had so much in common,
bro, like, so...

03:06.819 --> 03:08.688

{\an5}(Paris)
How can I hate
on Booby's new girlfriend

03:10.390 --> 03:12.191
when Daniel Junior
loves Sinfony?

03:12.258 --> 03:14.527
Plus Booby seems really happy.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.764
I'm not sure if Keyshia
and Sinfony met each other,

03:17.830 --> 03:20.533
but I know Keyshia and Booby
are no more.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.901
{\an1}One thing
I'm trying to figure out is

03:21.968 --> 03:23.570
{\an1}why are we in the gym
instead of--

03:23.636 --> 03:24.771
I'm working out,
'cause, you know,

03:24.837 --> 03:26.339
I got my call
and I'm acting now.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.141
{\an1}You know, I don't wanna
assist no more, so it's like--

03:28.207 --> 03:30.510
{\an5}Excited, P.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.510
--that's what I wanna do,
I wanna be a actress.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.379
{\an1}And plus these chicks coming
at me all left and right.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.848
{\an5}What you mean?

03:33.446 --> 03:35.848
{\an1}The other day I got into it
with K. Michelle.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.116
I thought that was dead?

03:37.183 --> 03:39.118
I thought it was dead too.

03:39.185 --> 03:41.287
So when I'm sitting here
talking to her,

03:41.354 --> 03:42.355
{\an1}you know, I'm looking like,
"What, bitch?

03:42.422 --> 03:43.823
Is you still
calling me a thief?"

03:43.890 --> 03:45.191
{\an4}Yeah.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.191
'Cause you...

03:45.258 --> 03:47.827
I just took a whole glass

03:47.894 --> 03:49.062
{\an4}Nah.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.062
{\an3}Chhh...

03:49.128 --> 03:50.830
{\an1}Sometime you gotta let
a mother(bleep) have it.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.465
{\an4}Well, I've been hanging out
with the other girls
out here too.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.933
{\an5}Who? Like who?

03:52.532 --> 03:53.933
Been hanging out

03:54.000 --> 03:56.402
But now she all about
to get married.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.273
Marcus.
He popped the question.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.642
That's information
that I should know.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.811
{\an1}You know, me and her been
rockin' since before Keyshia,

04:04.877 --> 04:07.880
{\an4}not even knowing no, like,
"This is my girlfriend,
I'm trying..."

04:07.947 --> 04:09.382
{\an5}But just

04:07.947 --> 04:09.382

04:09.449 --> 04:11.651
{\an4}This is somebody
that I love as family.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.651
{\an3}Okay.

04:12.952 --> 04:16.122
{\an1}Everything I hear about him
is negative.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.357
And to me it's like...

04:17.423 --> 04:19.257
{\an1}how many passes do a (bleep)
get before you...

04:19.325 --> 04:21.560
She deserves way better.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.630
I need to holler at him.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.031
Like, "My (bleep),

04:25.098 --> 04:27.200
{\an4}if this is who you gonna be
with," right?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.200
{\an3}Right.

04:27.266 --> 04:28.835
{\an1}"She shouldn't
have to be making sure

04:28.901 --> 04:31.504
{\an1}you doing what you
supposed to be doing."

04:34.240 --> 04:37.910
Two handsome brothers
at each other's throats for her.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.380
I guess all this negative stuff
Booby has to say about Marcus

04:40.446 --> 04:42.548
is the reason
why Brooke never told him.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.017
{\an5}I would rather holler at him--

04:42.615 --> 04:44.017
{\an3}Right.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.352
{\an1}--see if this is what you
really talking about doing.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.187
Just to see
how real the love is.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.957

20:54.786 --> 20:57.856
{\an5}Eggplant emoji?!

20:54.786 --> 20:57.856
It said "Zaddy,"
with a "Z"?

20:57.923 --> 20:58.957
It's a full "Zaddy"?

20:59.024 --> 21:00.258
I couldn't make this up.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.144
{\an5}"What's that mouth do?"

21:17.242 --> 21:19.144
First of all...

21:19.211 --> 21:21.380
{\an5}"What's that mouth do?"
All right.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.380
"...mouth... do..."

21:21.446 --> 21:22.914
Glad I ordered the shot.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.182
{\an5}'Cause that's what
this mouth does.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.182
"What's that mouth

21:24.249 --> 21:26.251

21:26.318 --> 21:27.486
"What's that mouth do?"

21:27.552 --> 21:28.987
"What's that mouth do?"

{\an1}Ask him, does he, he wanna

If Marcus is engaged,

21:37.496 --> 21:39.998
Amber need to keep her coochie
far away from him.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.000
But he is in the industry,

21:42.067 --> 21:44.970
so a few flirty text messages
won't hurt anyone.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.872
{\an5}I'm just confused.
Why are we texting
this Amber girl?

21:46.938 --> 21:49.207
{\an5}Have we talked to Marcus?
Have we questioned him?
Have we drilled him?

21:49.274 --> 21:50.776
Have we interrogated him?
Because I'm confused.

21:50.842 --> 21:52.744
Hold on, bitch, I got a reply.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.312

21:52.811 --> 21:54.312
"You'll see."

21:54.379 --> 21:57.115
{\an1}She trying me
right now, huh?

21:57.182 --> 21:58.817
I think I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.852
{\an5}I need this shot.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.852

26:54.813 --> 26:56.081
She doesn't want us
to discuss Lyrica

26:56.147 --> 26:57.983

she has been lately.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.317
{\an4}Right.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.317
Your mama's
a ho.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.186
Well, her mama clearly is.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.854
{\an4}That's why she don't know

27:01.252 --> 27:02.854

27:07.926 --> 27:09.427
That's why your daughter
is too.

27:09.494 --> 27:11.296
{\an1}Pam, I don't think you really

27:11.363 --> 27:13.798

"She did the same thing
early in our relationship.

he sent me this text message

27:31.683 --> 27:34.352

37:54.805 --> 37:57.341

Brooke was on the outs.

37:57.408 --> 37:58.909

a text from Marcus,

37:58.976 --> 38:01.479
I figured that he got tired
of Brooke Valentine

38:01.545 --> 38:03.014
and he just needed some loving.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.083
But now? I see why Marcus
don't go out in public with her.
