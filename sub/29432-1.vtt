WEBVTT

00:00.739 --> 00:02.138
Previously on Empire...

00:02.139 --> 00:04.089
Every boy needs his father.

00:04.808 --> 00:05.958
No!

00:06.193 --> 00:07.884
You're gonna have
to offer more than money

00:07.908 --> 00:10.241
to get me off your ass, Mr. Cross.

00:10.255 --> 00:11.639
I can get you Lucious Lyon.

00:11.663 --> 00:13.140
I figured we'd take off
for a little bit.

00:13.164 --> 00:16.110
Just get on the damn helicopter!

00:16.134 --> 00:18.479
I got to put me first!
I got to put me first, Lucious!

00:18.503 --> 00:19.747
- I understand baby, I know.
- Damon Cross.

00:19.771 --> 00:22.121
I slept with him, okay?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:36.688 --> 00:40.267
So I see you think
you got balls now, huh?

01:14.259 --> 01:17.905
So happy you could join us
today, Cookie, to serve

01:17.929 --> 01:19.173
a little tea again.

01:19.197 --> 01:20.641
I love the outfit.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.409
Oh, well, thank you, Janice.

01:22.433 --> 01:24.411
You know I love
to serve the children, hey.

01:24.435 --> 01:25.813
How hard is it

01:25.837 --> 01:27.515
to look good if you're her?
Now find me a dress

01:27.539 --> 01:29.350
that makes my lard ass look hot,
that's something.

01:29.374 --> 01:31.051
You always look hot to me, Lizzie.

01:31.075 --> 01:32.186
Okay, you're sweet.

01:32.210 --> 01:34.221
Obviously blind,
maybe a little bi, but sweet.

01:34.245 --> 01:36.490
Let's get into today's topics.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.059
- Donald Trump...
- Please tell me they finally

01:39.083 --> 01:41.162
threw his lying ass in prison.

01:41.186 --> 01:42.897
Maybe he has your old bunk.

01:42.921 --> 01:45.733
Or your husband's. Or your son's.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.771
Well, wherever he is, I'm sure
you'll be lobbying to be

01:50.795 --> 01:52.439
his prison bitch.

01:52.463 --> 01:53.774
What I would really like

01:53.798 --> 01:55.209
to talk about is what it's like

01:55.233 --> 01:56.510
to work with family.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.213
Cookie, you have famously worked
with yours.

01:59.237 --> 02:00.948
What is it like to manage your boys?

02:00.972 --> 02:02.850
Well, you know, I can't tell
my boys too much

02:02.874 --> 02:05.452
of nothing nowadays, child.
They grown.

02:05.476 --> 02:07.922
Yeah, they flew the nest,
but they still want breakfast.

02:08.791 --> 02:10.890
How many of you mothers out
there can identify with that?

02:10.914 --> 02:13.199
I know that's right.

02:52.624 --> 02:55.102
We have to cast this right
or none of this is gonna work.

02:55.126 --> 02:57.438
And it's not gonna happen on my watch.

02:57.462 --> 03:00.613
This is Empire's first film.
It has to be on point.

03:01.532 --> 03:03.844
Uh, he's got this.

03:03.868 --> 03:05.479
- Charlie.
- Yo, yo. What's up?

03:05.503 --> 03:08.082
- A word with you, brother.
- Yes, sir.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.783
What do you know about this scene?

03:09.807 --> 03:11.619
I mean, it's about Lucious.

03:11.643 --> 03:14.421
Yeah, okay, well, let me tell
you what it means to me, okay?

03:14.445 --> 03:16.657
This is my father's first time
taking the stage.

03:16.681 --> 03:17.958
All right?
He was hungry. He was desperate.

03:17.982 --> 03:19.693
He needed this more than anything,

03:19.717 --> 03:23.130
but he kept that, that need,
that want, that desperation,

03:23.154 --> 03:24.798
he kept it underneath the surface,

03:24.822 --> 03:26.800
- you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

03:26.824 --> 03:30.704
In this moment, on this stage,
he owned this place.

03:30.728 --> 03:33.607
And that crowd became his
because he took it.

03:33.631 --> 03:34.781
He took it!

03:36.801 --> 03:41.982
This is the moment my father
realized he was a king.

03:42.006 --> 03:43.050
- You got it?
- I got it.

03:43.074 --> 03:44.285
- Good, good.
- Thank you, man.

03:44.309 --> 03:46.053
- Yeah, you got it.
- I can go again?

03:46.077 --> 03:47.988
- Please.
- A'ight. Thank you.

03:48.012 --> 03:49.523
Let's do it again.

03:49.547 --> 03:51.625
King doesn't tell you
who he is, Charlie.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.460
He shows you.

04:14.759 --> 04:16.583
Ooh, that bitch got one more
time to come for my family

04:16.607 --> 04:18.819
- before I go for her throat.
- She's goading you.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.187
It's the only way she gets attention.

04:20.211 --> 04:21.922
Yeah, well, she will get
my full attention

04:21.946 --> 04:24.391
- with my Louboutin fully up her ass.
- You're so funny.

04:24.415 --> 04:25.893
Yeah, I know, but I'm not playing.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.429
I did 17 years, I'll shank that bitch.

04:28.453 --> 04:30.030
Easy, Scarface.

04:30.054 --> 04:32.066
Listen, your trial run
has been fantastic,

04:32.090 --> 04:34.268
and the producers want
to make you a permanent co-host.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.570
They just need to know
that Lucious and Empire

04:36.594 --> 04:39.039
- are finally behind you.
- That's none of their damn business, baby.

04:39.063 --> 04:41.075
Is it a problem? Do you
even know where Lucious is?

04:41.099 --> 04:43.510
I don't. Okay? But nobody
gets to tell Cookie Lyon

04:43.534 --> 04:44.878
- what she can and cannot do, sweetheart.
- I hate it when you

04:44.902 --> 04:46.413
refer to yourself in the third person.

04:46.437 --> 04:49.049
Well, Cookie Lyon loves it,
so get used to it.

04:49.073 --> 04:52.286
Look, I am proud of what
my family did with Empire.

04:52.310 --> 04:54.355
And Lucious is my husband.

04:54.379 --> 04:56.056
But you left him.
That was your choice.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.558
Why not make it public?

04:57.582 --> 05:00.094
My choice, my damn business.
Hey, babies!

05:00.118 --> 05:02.029
- Cookie, Cookie!
- Cookie!

05:02.053 --> 05:04.631
How you... A Patti pie, honey.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.400
I love you. I love you.

05:06.424 --> 05:08.202
Okay, well, if you want this gig,

05:08.226 --> 05:09.703
the producers need assurance
that you've moved on

05:09.727 --> 05:11.071
from the Coocious drama.

05:11.095 --> 05:13.779
I mean, really,
don't you think Lucious has?

05:15.066 --> 05:16.910
Love you, Cookie!

05:16.934 --> 05:18.312
I love you, too!

05:18.336 --> 05:19.613
That's the tea, baby!

05:27.111 --> 05:29.089
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Lyon?

05:29.113 --> 05:32.226
You look mighty comfy
in your daddy's chair.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.662
The FBI. What an unexpected delight.

05:35.686 --> 05:38.065
Are you here to have
the same conversation

05:38.089 --> 05:40.734
we've been having
over the last six months?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.736
I don't know where my father is.
I haven't seen him.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.505
- I haven't had contact with him...
- Produce Lucious Lyon

05:44.529 --> 05:45.973
or we're gonna go public

05:45.997 --> 05:47.608
that he's wanted for money laundering.

05:47.632 --> 05:50.344
I have a feeling that might
dampen the excitement

05:50.368 --> 05:52.012
over your little Empire movie.

05:52.036 --> 05:54.481
And that Fox Sports deal
that you just inked.

05:54.505 --> 05:56.316
You've been reading the trades.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.518
- Mm.
- Good for you.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.453
You're not gonna do that, Agent Davis.

05:59.477 --> 06:00.921
Really? Why, why not?

06:00.945 --> 06:03.157
Well, because any day now,
my father's going to show up

06:03.181 --> 06:04.992
with evidence
that'll prove his innocence.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.428
And you'll end up
with egg on your face.

06:07.452 --> 06:10.531
Not a good look for a man or woman

06:10.555 --> 06:13.000
as ambitious as yourselves.

06:13.024 --> 06:15.936
I have a lot of work
to catch up on, so...

06:15.960 --> 06:17.743
you can see yourself out.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.450
Well, you know,
I can't tell my boys...

06:38.182 --> 06:42.196
Hey. Kill that mess, man,
it's killing the whole vibe.

07:44.582 --> 07:46.026
- I'm sick of you.
- What?

07:46.050 --> 07:47.928
- Bad girl. You didn't do
- What?

07:47.952 --> 07:50.464
A damn thing that I told you to do.

07:50.488 --> 07:51.698
So?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.767
I followed my spirit,

07:53.791 --> 07:55.802
and it felt divine.

07:55.826 --> 07:58.805
Well, it could have felt better.

07:58.829 --> 08:00.240
Hmm.

08:00.264 --> 08:02.381
Better than this?

08:08.272 --> 08:09.283
Come on, baby.

08:11.342 --> 08:12.719
I got the neck.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.389
- Mm-hmm.
- I got the mole.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.424
- That's a lot.
- Oh. People might come in.

08:17.448 --> 08:19.459
Well, yes, that's the idea, isn't it?

08:19.483 --> 08:21.495
That's the idea?

08:21.519 --> 08:24.264
- You just don't care, huh?
- Just let me get one bite.

08:24.288 --> 08:25.999
Just one.

08:26.023 --> 08:27.973
That's two.

08:37.152 --> 08:39.764
All right. We had a guest on the show.

08:39.788 --> 08:43.673
She swears by this; says it's
the best thing for the baby.

08:44.593 --> 08:47.138
Hmm. Here.

08:47.162 --> 08:48.540
Really, Cookie?

08:48.564 --> 08:50.075
Yes, really. Now, drink it up.

08:50.099 --> 08:51.276
- Okay.
- I know what I'm talking about.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.412
I'm taking care of my grandbaby. Mmm.

08:56.238 --> 08:57.949
- Mm.
- It's good, right?

08:57.973 --> 09:00.151
- Hey.
- Hey!

09:00.175 --> 09:01.253
Hey, you good?

09:01.277 --> 09:02.454
Oh.

09:02.478 --> 09:03.655
Well, you look good.

09:03.679 --> 09:04.923
How's my boy?

09:04.947 --> 09:07.392
Your ma is trying to poison us.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.894
- Oh, please.
- Ma, Teri is a nurse.

09:09.918 --> 09:11.062
She knows what's best for the baby.

09:11.086 --> 09:13.069
And I'm your mother.
I raised you, didn't I?

09:13.922 --> 09:14.966
Uh, look, how is your heart, baby?

09:14.990 --> 09:16.835
You taking your meds?

09:16.859 --> 09:18.470
Ah, my heart is good, Ma.

09:18.494 --> 09:21.740
- In fact, I'm doing better than good.
- Oh?

09:21.764 --> 09:23.908
I found somebody to play Lucious.

09:23.932 --> 09:26.811
You're still going ahead
with that stupid-ass movie?

09:26.835 --> 09:29.147
You ain't slick, Teri. I'm just
gonna pour you another one.

09:29.171 --> 09:30.482
That stupid-ass movie

09:30.506 --> 09:32.684
burnishes Empire's brand, Ma.

09:32.708 --> 09:34.653
Or it brands us as corny,

09:34.677 --> 09:36.421
like all them other Hollywood movies.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.156
I thought you were staying out
of Empire business, Ma.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.824
Boy, I'm bigger than Empire.

09:39.848 --> 09:41.926
Didn't y'all see me on that show
schooling them bitches?

09:41.950 --> 09:43.967
Y'all saw me on TV.

09:44.987 --> 09:46.197
Yes, Ma, you're a star.

09:46.221 --> 09:48.333
- There's only one Cookie Lyon.
- Damn right.

09:48.357 --> 09:51.636
- Thank God for that.
- Oh, look at Miss Teri Sunshine.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.271
Where you get
all that spunk from, girl?

09:53.295 --> 09:54.839
You better be careful 'fore I throw

09:54.863 --> 09:56.207
them big-ass cankles out my house.

09:56.231 --> 09:58.343
Oh, no, no, no.
I love your cankles, baby.

09:58.367 --> 09:59.878
- Oh...
- Mm, they're not too big.

09:59.902 --> 10:02.347
- They're too big.
- No, they're not too big.

10:02.371 --> 10:04.616
Girl, what the hell

10:04.640 --> 10:05.950
are you wearing?

10:05.974 --> 10:08.219
Um... Jamal and I used to wear these

10:08.243 --> 10:10.055
to our sleepovers all the time, so...

10:10.079 --> 10:12.190
No wonder that boy ran off to London.

10:12.214 --> 10:15.060
I thought he was running away
from Lyon drama.

10:15.084 --> 10:16.961
I really miss him.

10:16.985 --> 10:18.830
Please don't get me started.

10:18.854 --> 10:20.465
I miss him so much.

10:20.489 --> 10:23.802
Anyway, why do we need
to have this slumber party?

10:23.826 --> 10:27.205
Okay. I need some advice.

10:27.229 --> 10:28.640
- Mm-kay.
- Okay, so Giselle and I

10:28.664 --> 10:31.676
have a really big meeting tomorrow.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.878
Like, big. "Big" as in "huge."

10:33.902 --> 10:35.814
I'd tell you who it is,

10:35.838 --> 10:38.149
but I can't, so I won't.

10:38.173 --> 10:40.151
But I really, really need

10:40.175 --> 10:42.153
to nail the pitch, okay?

10:42.177 --> 10:44.222
- We really gotta land her.
- Oh.

10:44.246 --> 10:45.490
So it's a her.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.991
Of course it's a her.

10:47.015 --> 10:49.494
Our label is about women,

10:49.518 --> 10:51.663
for women, by women, featuring women,

10:51.687 --> 10:53.064
women, women, women.

10:53.088 --> 10:55.934
Oh, honey, that's a lot
of weave and tampons.

10:55.958 --> 10:56.935
It's half the budget.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.236
Yeah.

10:58.260 --> 10:59.671
Well, y'all go right on ahead

10:59.695 --> 11:01.206
with your vajayjay power.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.208
The only thing is,

11:03.232 --> 11:05.844
Giselle will not sign anyone

11:05.868 --> 11:08.380
before we get
our marquee artist, so...

11:08.404 --> 11:11.082
I mean, doesn't Giselle
understand that it is your job

11:11.106 --> 11:13.418
to go out, find the artists
and turn them into stars?

11:13.442 --> 11:15.186
I mean, that's what good labels do.

11:15.210 --> 11:18.223
Oh, look at you. You miss it?

11:18.247 --> 11:19.858
What?

11:19.882 --> 11:22.260
This. Empire, the music.

11:22.284 --> 11:24.229
This used to be in your blood.

11:24.253 --> 11:27.565
I need something new, something fresh.

11:27.589 --> 11:28.967
Like your talk show.

11:28.991 --> 11:32.604
And my community center,
among other things.

11:32.628 --> 11:35.039
Uh, this is time for me.

11:35.063 --> 11:37.442
Okay? I'm building my own brand.

11:37.466 --> 11:39.244
Oh, you about to be
a whole mogul out here.

11:39.268 --> 11:42.113
Yes. It is Cookie's time.

11:42.137 --> 11:44.688
Ooh, I almost forgot.

11:47.776 --> 11:50.388
- Potato chips?
- Yes, girl, salt and sweet.

11:50.412 --> 11:52.390
Isn't that Lucious's thing?

11:52.414 --> 11:53.730
So?

11:55.684 --> 11:58.062
So, you miss him.

11:58.086 --> 12:00.732
Look how mad you just got.

12:00.756 --> 12:01.833
- You miss him.
- I didn't get mad.

12:01.857 --> 12:03.635
No, you miss miss him.

12:03.659 --> 12:05.403
Do you think you guys are gonna
get back together?

12:05.427 --> 12:07.005
Girl, do I look like
a damn fortune tell...

12:07.029 --> 12:08.773
Look, uh, Becky?

12:08.797 --> 12:11.676
Eat this ice cream 'fore
I put your ass out my house.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.978
- I thought we were sharing.
- Ah-ah. Please, just...

12:14.002 --> 12:15.313
- The... a quiet moment, please.
- I thought we were girlfriends.

12:15.337 --> 12:16.748
J-Just eat-eat the ice cream.

12:23.278 --> 12:25.457
And we just want you to
know that we will be dedicating

12:25.481 --> 12:27.258
all of our time and attention to you

12:27.282 --> 12:29.194
as if you are our only artist.

12:29.218 --> 12:31.362
Ain't that what I'd be, though?

12:31.386 --> 12:34.599
Well, actually, you would be
treated like our first artist.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.434
- Ah.
- I mean, we have a vision

12:36.458 --> 12:38.136
for your career that nobody else has.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.039
My experience in brand
marketing, Becky in A&R,

12:41.063 --> 12:42.340
that's a killer combination.

12:42.364 --> 12:43.975
Yes, you're big,

12:43.999 --> 12:47.612
but we can make you even bigger
on multiple platforms.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.214
Yeah. I...

12:49.238 --> 12:51.683
Listen, I really like
and admire the both of you,

12:51.707 --> 12:53.551
so I'm-a be honest with y'all.

12:53.575 --> 12:54.552
- Thank you.
- I appreciate that.

12:54.576 --> 12:56.120
I'm not signing with Bossy.

12:56.144 --> 12:58.723
Y'all too small.
But I'll tell you what I can do.

12:58.747 --> 13:01.392
I'll let y'all leak to TMI
that we had this meeting.

13:01.416 --> 13:02.994
That should help
y'all out a little bit.

13:03.018 --> 13:05.296
- So generous of you.
- Thank you for that.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.732
These some nice-ass offices, though.

13:07.756 --> 13:10.368
Hit me up with
your designer's info, okay?

13:10.392 --> 13:12.070
- Okay.
- Be well.

13:12.094 --> 13:13.972
Bye, now.

13:16.398 --> 13:17.909
"Treat you like the only artist"?

13:17.933 --> 13:19.911
Why did it sound so good
in my head last night?

13:19.935 --> 13:22.080
- Were you high last night?
- No, I wasn't high...

13:22.104 --> 13:24.148
Yeah, but just a little bit.

13:26.174 --> 13:28.419
Andre, security
brought this gentleman up.

13:28.443 --> 13:29.687
He says that you're expecting him,

13:29.711 --> 13:31.795
but he's not on my calendar.

13:33.549 --> 13:34.726
Mouse.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.160
Oh, no, no. He's good, he's good.

13:36.184 --> 13:38.068
Maya, close that door, please.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.367
When the hell did you get out, boy?

13:42.391 --> 13:43.680
Hey, why didn't you call me?

13:43.681 --> 13:45.431
I tried to hit you up. I think
you must've changed your number.

13:45.432 --> 13:46.287
Ah.

13:46.311 --> 13:47.572
I been here about an hour.
They wouldn't let me up.

13:47.596 --> 13:49.007
Oh, I'm sorry about that, man. Listen,

13:49.031 --> 13:50.909
I am stoked to see you. Have a seat.

13:50.933 --> 13:52.610
I'm-a pour you something
to drink, man. What do you like?

13:52.634 --> 13:56.180
Shoot, everything. No ice.

13:56.204 --> 13:59.117
- So, what you got planned, man?
- Frankly, uh, I could use a job.

13:59.141 --> 14:02.120
You know how it is.
Or maybe you don't.

14:02.144 --> 14:03.555
Maybe I don't?

14:03.579 --> 14:05.223
You playing, boy.

14:05.247 --> 14:06.591
You know I know.

14:06.615 --> 14:09.727
And I can help you out.

14:09.751 --> 14:10.895
What type of job you looking for?

14:10.919 --> 14:11.812
All right.

14:11.813 --> 14:13.807
I've been thinking about
this for a long time.

14:13.808 --> 14:14.933
All right.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.734
I want something
where I can wear a suit.

14:16.758 --> 14:18.136
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- I've always dreamed

14:18.160 --> 14:20.405
of having an office with a window.

14:20.429 --> 14:23.274
Maybe something here at Empire?

14:23.298 --> 14:24.976
Close to yours, so we can hang, huh?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.611
See, that's what I'm talking about.

14:26.635 --> 14:28.646
Let me go down there,
check out, see what's open.

14:28.670 --> 14:30.648
But first step is gonna have to
be, you know, you go to HR...

14:30.672 --> 14:34.218
Can't you just do me a solid?
I mean, you came out to this.

14:34.242 --> 14:35.592
I came out to nothing...

14:37.279 --> 14:40.196
...after staying in because of you.

14:42.985 --> 14:45.401
Damn right you owe me.

14:47.623 --> 14:49.601
I know I owe you.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.436
And I'm-a square you up, okay?

14:51.460 --> 14:54.572
Might take a day or two.
You got my word.

14:54.596 --> 14:56.647
Just like in the day, right?
All right. I got you.

14:56.671 --> 14:57.821
Yeah, man.

14:59.801 --> 15:02.080
I'd like to thank you all
for getting behind me

15:02.104 --> 15:04.782
while my father's on sabbatical,
and for stepping up

15:04.806 --> 15:06.784
in light of some
recent staff departures.

15:06.808 --> 15:08.953
Are you gonna be announcing
promotions to fill those slots?

15:08.977 --> 15:10.455
Absolutely. Very soon.

15:10.479 --> 15:11.923
Thank you very much, Porsha.

15:11.947 --> 15:13.691
We got some big announcements
this week.

15:13.715 --> 15:16.266
Empire will provide the
theme song for Fox Basketball...

15:17.352 --> 15:19.097
...and Charlie Dupree

15:19.121 --> 15:20.932
- will star as Lucious Lyon...
- All right.

15:20.956 --> 15:23.807
In the new Empire film.

15:25.494 --> 15:27.639
Thank you.

15:27.663 --> 15:30.775
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

15:37.706 --> 15:39.455
Hey, Andre.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.323
Maybe you should make
an announcement about me?

15:45.347 --> 15:47.058
Tracy? Um...

15:47.082 --> 15:48.459
What are you doing here?

15:48.483 --> 15:50.228
Where else would I be?

15:50.252 --> 15:52.563
I'm Empire's newest co-owner.

15:53.822 --> 15:56.606
Hi.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.345
Your own interest in Empire...

16:03.346 --> 16:05.725
- How the hell is that possible?
- Cookie gave me shares

16:05.749 --> 16:07.748
in exchange for my son's heart.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.943
You traded Kingsley's heart?

16:09.944 --> 16:11.760
I saved your life, Andre.

16:13.614 --> 16:15.759
Close your mouth.
You're attracting flies.

16:15.783 --> 16:18.795
Why would you want a part of Empire?

16:18.819 --> 16:21.164
I need a little fun in my life.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.633
I used to help Lucious
with his music back in the day.

16:23.657 --> 16:26.174
I was really good at it, too.
I had a real ear.

16:28.329 --> 16:30.812
And I want to be close to my son.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.852
I-I... miss him so much.

16:41.008 --> 16:42.452
Hey...

16:42.476 --> 16:44.526
Can I hear my boy?

16:59.860 --> 17:03.406
Oh...

17:03.430 --> 17:06.009
There you are, my love.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.047
You got to make sure

17:11.070 --> 17:12.549
you eat some of them lamb chops, girl.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.085
Okay? That's iron.
That baby needs iron, now.

17:15.108 --> 17:16.519
Mmm, these green beans, though. Mmm.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.054
Give that baby some meat, girl.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.857
No vegan grandchild...

17:24.785 --> 17:26.061
You gave White Tracy a stake

17:26.086 --> 17:28.064
in Empire? Have you lost your mind?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.539
Have you lost your damn mind,
hollering at me?

17:32.026 --> 17:34.371
Dre, I would have given her
the whole damn company

17:34.395 --> 17:36.740
if that's what it would've taken
to save your life.

17:39.366 --> 17:41.678
Now, she was supposed to let me
break the news to you,

17:41.702 --> 17:43.413
but I guess that goes to show

17:43.437 --> 17:45.348
you can't trust an ex-crackhead.

17:45.372 --> 17:46.683
So you just let her
into our boardroom.

17:46.707 --> 17:47.784
That's great, Ma. That's real great.

17:47.808 --> 17:49.219
Does Pop know what you did?

17:49.243 --> 17:51.054
Oh, you think I need
your daddy's permission?

17:51.078 --> 17:53.456
Boy, you don't know me at all, do you?

17:53.480 --> 17:55.025
You know, Andre, you cannot

17:55.049 --> 17:57.127
be mad at Cookie
for trying to save your life.

17:57.151 --> 17:58.929
Thank you, Teri. Glad somebody

17:58.953 --> 18:01.097
around here got
some good damn common sense.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.134
Oh, and I'm going with you
to your checkup tomorrow.

18:04.158 --> 18:07.175
Yeah, I need to make sure
my investment is paying off.

18:09.063 --> 18:12.581
Yeah, you better sit your ass down.

18:14.668 --> 18:16.813
Well, I've been thinking...

18:16.837 --> 18:19.221
- Not a good time to start that, Hakeem.
- Um, hello?

18:22.343 --> 18:25.322
I want to play Lucious
in the Empire movie.

18:25.346 --> 18:28.291
You know, I could bring
that realness, bro.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.960
Nobody can do that.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.996
We need a star in that role.
An A-list actor.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.565
Well, now, you can get a lot of press,

18:35.589 --> 18:40.770
a lot of hype,
if Hakeem plays his daddy.

18:40.794 --> 18:44.774
But I'm not sticking my nose
in Empire's business.

18:44.798 --> 18:47.644
Miss Maya is here.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.479
I keep telling her

18:49.503 --> 18:50.680
she doesn't need to introduce me.

18:50.704 --> 18:51.982
Um, we have a problem.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.917
- What is it?
- The feds

18:53.941 --> 18:55.352
just held a press conference
telling the world

18:55.376 --> 18:57.687
that Lucious is a wanted fugitive.

18:57.711 --> 18:59.928
Oh, that's great.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.629
Andre Lyon.

19:06.653 --> 19:08.365
Yes.

19:08.389 --> 19:10.105
I think that's shortsighted.

19:14.561 --> 19:16.773
Charlie Dupree is no longer
willing to play Lucious,

19:16.797 --> 19:19.876
and our co-financiers
are pulling out of the film.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.812
Yeah, 'cause they heard that
bitch press conference, right?

19:22.836 --> 19:25.120
Fox deal is gonna
come off the table next.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.356
The feds are trying to destroy us.

19:37.184 --> 19:40.797
Look, when the hell
is this doctor gonna get here?

19:40.821 --> 19:42.804
He'll be here soon, Ma.

19:44.091 --> 19:47.904
Look, Andre, I know Empire
is on your mind, but...

19:47.928 --> 19:50.140
Pop trusted me with Empire, Ma.

19:50.164 --> 19:51.875
I can't let it fail.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.011
Boy, that thing will
work itself out. Okay?

19:55.035 --> 19:57.414
Andre, your health
is more important, baby.

19:57.438 --> 19:59.049
We got to make sure your heart is fine

19:59.073 --> 20:01.056
and that cancer is cleaned u...

20:03.110 --> 20:04.854
- Anybody see you?
- No, I'm good.

20:04.878 --> 20:07.362
What the hell is he doing here?

20:09.049 --> 20:11.394
We're not here for the doctor, okay?

20:11.418 --> 20:14.998
The feds are coming for Empire,
we're about to take a huge hit.

20:15.022 --> 20:17.934
We need the evidence on
Damon Cross to clear Pop's name,

20:17.958 --> 20:19.369
and it's gonna take us...

20:19.393 --> 20:21.871
all of us, Ma...
working together to do it.

20:21.895 --> 20:23.873
This is about family.

20:23.897 --> 20:26.509
Our legacy.
It's bigger than your marriage.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.678
Now, you two can kiss
and make up later, or not. I...

20:28.702 --> 20:30.680
We need a solution now.

20:30.704 --> 20:33.283
Give you a minute to work this out.

20:33.307 --> 20:35.251
- We have 30 minutes.
- I'm-a beat your ass.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.725
Work it out, Ma.

20:46.691 --> 20:50.437
Well, if it isn't
the Third Coming of Jesus?

20:50.461 --> 20:51.262
Amen.

20:51.286 --> 20:53.674
Oh, look, that's just
me trying to be civil.

20:53.698 --> 20:55.242
To hell with your damn civility.

20:55.266 --> 20:57.077
We wouldn't be in this situation

20:57.101 --> 21:00.080
if it hadn't been for you
and what you did with Damon.

21:00.104 --> 21:02.049
I wouldn't have gone
to Damon Cross if you were

21:02.073 --> 21:03.517
willing and able
to give me what I needed.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.452
- Wait, what you needed?
- Yes.

21:05.476 --> 21:07.526
What I needed.

21:09.313 --> 21:11.663
What?

21:12.583 --> 21:14.695
You didn't even sleep with him.

21:14.719 --> 21:17.130
You didn't.

21:17.154 --> 21:19.199
That is none of your business.

21:19.223 --> 21:21.868
No, I knew it. You can't cheat on me,

21:21.892 --> 21:25.305
'cause can't nobody do for you
like I do for you.

21:25.329 --> 21:27.802
What? And what is that, Lucious?

21:27.803 --> 21:32.501
'Huh? Give me pain and misery
and heart attacks?

21:33.634 --> 21:35.521
I never had to screw Damon

21:35.522 --> 21:38.552
to get more from him
what I ever got from you.

21:38.576 --> 21:40.487
Then why ain't you
with his ass right now, huh?

21:40.511 --> 21:42.289
Why ain't you with that son of a bitch

21:42.313 --> 21:45.759
that put our family in the
crosshairs so he can get you?

21:45.783 --> 21:49.463
Lucious, I don't need Damon
no more than I need your ass.

21:49.487 --> 21:51.832
Yeah, well, half of that's
a lie, and I bet your dumb ass

21:51.856 --> 21:53.567
- don't even know which one.
- Yeah, see,

21:53.591 --> 21:56.269
you know about lies,
don't you, Lucious?

21:56.293 --> 21:59.005
Lies and deceit,

21:59.029 --> 22:03.009
and broken promises, backstabs.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.644
- You know about that.
- Wait, I couldn't tell you

22:04.668 --> 22:06.179
about Andre!

22:06.203 --> 22:10.751
It's not about Andre! It's about us!

22:10.775 --> 22:13.787
I needed you to think
about me for a change.

22:13.811 --> 22:15.422
It ain't always about you, Cookie.

22:15.446 --> 22:17.991
Oh, yeah, well,
you proved that, Lucious!

22:18.015 --> 22:20.594
You proved that already.

22:20.618 --> 22:25.165
Don't worry,
I'm-a fix this for my family,

22:25.189 --> 22:27.134
not for your black ass.

22:27.158 --> 22:28.635
I don't need your help.

22:28.659 --> 22:30.470
I will fix this, and when I'm done,

22:30.494 --> 22:32.172
I'm gonna go back to my girl.

22:32.196 --> 22:33.340
- Oh, your new bitch.
- Yeah.

22:33.364 --> 22:34.474
Right. Okay.

22:34.498 --> 22:37.277
I'm over you, Cookie.

22:37.301 --> 22:38.951
Nah.

22:41.238 --> 22:44.122
You could never be over me.

22:48.412 --> 22:51.057
You can change your hair,
get as fancy as you want,

22:51.081 --> 22:53.794
get all the new bitches
you need, honey,

22:53.818 --> 22:56.969
but you'll never be over me.

22:59.657 --> 23:03.136
- Hey, partner.
- Hi.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.971
I want you to check this girl out.

23:04.995 --> 23:06.573
I found her online.

23:06.597 --> 23:09.376
She can sing, and she has
millions of views.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.552
TheTube? What... I-I thought
we already discussed this.

23:18.576 --> 23:20.887
Ooh, you're being kind of negative.

23:20.911 --> 23:22.489
Can you just listen?

23:22.513 --> 23:23.824
I don't need to.

23:23.848 --> 23:25.592
Because if I don't know her
name, then she's obviously

23:25.616 --> 23:27.727
not our marquee artist.

23:27.751 --> 23:30.730
First of all, she sings her ass off,

23:30.754 --> 23:35.101
she's gorgeous and she's got
four million followers.

23:35.125 --> 23:36.770
So if I didn't act fast,

23:36.794 --> 23:38.538
there was gonna be a bidding war.

23:38.562 --> 23:41.072
Becky, do not tell me what I
think you are about to tell me.

23:43.067 --> 23:45.512
I made an executive decision,

23:45.536 --> 23:47.547
- and I signed her.
- Oh, my God.

23:47.571 --> 23:50.584
You had no right to act unilaterally.

23:50.608 --> 23:53.520
That is not what Black Girl
Magic is all about.

23:53.544 --> 23:55.789
Oh, no, I betrayed Black Girl Magic.

23:55.813 --> 23:57.090
Girl, rent is due, okay,

23:57.114 --> 23:58.525
and she's already on the plane

23:58.549 --> 24:01.194
on her way here to meet us in person.

24:01.218 --> 24:03.129
You signed somebody
you haven't even met yet?

24:03.153 --> 24:05.899
Wow. Okay, baby girl,

24:05.923 --> 24:10.203
we had a digi-meeting;
that means digital.

24:10.227 --> 24:12.205
I fell in love with her,
and you will, too.

24:12.229 --> 24:16.409
Okay? So... so we have signed
our first artist.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.544
Congratulations.

24:22.907 --> 24:24.417
No, no matter what happens,

24:24.441 --> 24:27.559
I'm gonna handle Damon Cross' ass.

24:29.346 --> 24:31.057
Are you all right, son?

24:31.081 --> 24:34.761
I just don't want to let you down.

24:34.785 --> 24:37.564
I mean, I'm doing everything
I can to build Empire back, Pop,

24:37.588 --> 24:41.234
but Empire's being attacked
on all sides.

24:41.258 --> 24:43.770
That's the nature of a kingdom.

24:43.794 --> 24:46.573
It's always under attack,
and the problem is

24:46.597 --> 24:49.075
I raised you to be a prince,

24:49.099 --> 24:51.678
but a prince has no real power.

24:51.702 --> 24:55.015
You only have power
when you become king.

24:55.039 --> 24:59.419
And as a king, you will have
to defend your kingdom

24:59.443 --> 25:01.588
by any means.

25:01.612 --> 25:03.757
And when the time comes,
you'll know exactly

25:03.781 --> 25:06.192
what you need to do.

25:06.216 --> 25:08.929
Sorry, Andre, but Empire
cannot represent Fox

25:08.953 --> 25:10.669
while your father is a fugitive.

25:17.661 --> 25:21.107
If my father is guilty
of what they're accusing him of,

25:21.131 --> 25:22.776
it is a direct violation

25:22.800 --> 25:25.812
and betrayal against what
my new Empire stands for,

25:25.836 --> 25:29.716
and I will turn him in myself.

25:29.740 --> 25:33.258
I'm inviting you to be a part
of the new Empire.

25:36.914 --> 25:39.498
Join me.

25:40.384 --> 25:42.829
I can sell that.

25:42.853 --> 25:44.664
I'll take it back to our team.

25:44.688 --> 25:48.039
Yes, sir. Thank you.

25:49.393 --> 25:50.904
- Thank you. Smart man.
- Yes, sir.

25:56.667 --> 25:57.911
Teri?

26:01.238 --> 26:02.649
Hey, sweetheart.

26:02.673 --> 26:05.885
Yo, what's up, man?

26:05.909 --> 26:08.188
Oh, Teri and me, we just

26:08.212 --> 26:10.322
been kicking it, waiting
for your ass to get home.

26:11.615 --> 26:15.095
Um, I'm gonna get off my feet,

26:15.119 --> 26:16.763
and I'm gonna let you two catch up.

26:16.787 --> 26:18.336
I'll be up in a minute.

26:20.190 --> 26:22.202
Man, that is one sweet...

26:22.226 --> 26:26.072
You don't come to my home
without an invitation.

26:26.096 --> 26:27.741
Ever.

26:27.765 --> 26:29.743
My bad. I'm just anxious, man.

26:29.767 --> 26:31.578
All this waiting
for you to come through.

26:31.602 --> 26:33.185
I'm ready for my life to start.

26:39.143 --> 26:40.692
Want to top me off?

26:53.157 --> 26:56.302
I got nothing for you, Mouse.

26:56.326 --> 26:59.277
Soon as I got something tight,
I'll let you know.

27:01.231 --> 27:04.583
- Cool.
- Cool.

27:07.004 --> 27:09.120
That's all I needed to know.

27:25.656 --> 27:27.639
Nice house.

27:28.826 --> 27:31.209
Nice family.

27:49.857 --> 27:51.501
Trini Bayer's new book,

27:51.525 --> 27:52.769
Marrying the Bad Boy,

27:52.793 --> 27:54.304
has shot to number one

27:54.328 --> 27:56.039
on The New York Times
Best Seller list.

27:56.063 --> 27:59.042
Why does a book with a title
like that rocket to the top?

27:59.066 --> 28:00.877
Well, Jan, maybe the time has come

28:00.901 --> 28:03.347
when we women have to stop
pointing our fingers at men,

28:03.371 --> 28:05.148
at what men do to us.

28:05.172 --> 28:07.824
Why do we let them do it?
Am I right, Cook?

28:07.848 --> 28:08.719
Excuse me?

28:08.743 --> 28:11.855
Well, let's face it, Cook,
y-you seem like a smart woman,

28:11.879 --> 28:13.290
but you've been married

28:13.314 --> 28:15.559
to an abusive, lying, womanizing thug

28:15.583 --> 28:17.394
for how many years?

28:17.418 --> 28:20.230
I mean, is anyone surprised that
the FBI's after Lucious Lyon?

28:20.254 --> 28:22.132
First of all, don't call me "Cook."

28:22.156 --> 28:23.800
And second of all,

28:23.824 --> 28:25.302
get your mouth off my husband.

28:25.326 --> 28:27.404
Okay, don't be so hostile.

28:27.428 --> 28:28.805
Oh, okay, there's a topic.

28:28.829 --> 28:31.174
Now why is it that
when white women get mad

28:31.198 --> 28:32.743
it's called strength,

28:32.767 --> 28:35.812
but when black women get mad
it's called hostile?

28:35.836 --> 28:38.415
- Okay, I'm feeling threatened by that.
- Oh, now you're threatened?

28:38.439 --> 28:40.150
Why are you defending Lucious Lyon?

28:40.174 --> 28:42.986
I mean, if Lucious
is a womanizer or abuser

28:43.010 --> 28:45.756
or all these things
you claim that he is,

28:45.780 --> 28:48.425
then why are you pointing your
finger at me like it's my fault?

28:48.449 --> 28:51.328
When are we going to stop
blaming women

28:51.352 --> 28:53.196
for the things that their men do?

28:53.220 --> 28:55.250
- Yeah.
- That's right.

28:59.527 --> 29:02.739
I left my husband

29:02.763 --> 29:06.410
and the company
we built together, and...

29:06.434 --> 29:07.983
it's hard.

29:11.238 --> 29:14.751
It's the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

29:14.775 --> 29:16.186
And for you two

29:16.210 --> 29:18.288
to sit up here
and slam me with his name

29:18.312 --> 29:21.792
every damn chance you get
doesn't make it easier.

29:21.816 --> 29:22.638
Can we cut to commercial?

29:22.662 --> 29:24.127
Oh, what, you need to
change your diaper?

29:24.151 --> 29:26.596
Okay, this is blowing my mind.

29:26.620 --> 29:28.432
Oh, no, stupid, your mind was blown

29:28.456 --> 29:30.901
after those three white lines
you snorted in the green room.

29:32.093 --> 29:33.937
There's your tea, baby,

29:33.961 --> 29:35.372
with a Cookie on the side.

30:00.254 --> 30:03.433
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

30:03.457 --> 30:06.937
- I was singing you home.
- Mm, well, it worked.

30:11.766 --> 30:15.912
Look, baby, um...

30:15.936 --> 30:19.683
I got to tell you something.

30:19.707 --> 30:22.452
Okay.

30:22.476 --> 30:25.822
My real name...

30:25.846 --> 30:28.830
- who I really am...
- Shh.

30:30.985 --> 30:33.196
You're Lucious Lyon.

30:33.220 --> 30:36.700
You knew?

30:36.724 --> 30:38.702
Of course I knew.

30:38.726 --> 30:41.671
I knew the minute you started
talking music to me.

30:41.695 --> 30:44.641
Then you also know that
I'm on the run from the FBI,

30:44.665 --> 30:47.978
and that I got to keep things moving.

30:48.002 --> 30:50.280
Wait, so you're saying
that you're leaving?

30:50.304 --> 30:53.016
Now, look, baby, I'm...
I want to stay,

30:53.040 --> 30:56.019
- but I got to be realistic.
- Okay.

30:56.043 --> 30:59.189
If I'm gonna ever clear my name,
I got to get some money.

30:59.213 --> 31:00.991
- Oh, I have money.
- No.

31:01.015 --> 31:03.193
Baby, you sing at a dive bar.

31:03.217 --> 31:07.564
And I have a very, very,
very rich father.

31:07.588 --> 31:10.033
I mean, he's horrible,
but he pays all of my bills,

31:10.057 --> 31:11.535
and even though we don't really talk,

31:11.559 --> 31:13.670
if I ask him for money, he'll send it.

31:13.694 --> 31:16.545
- Baby, that's not what I want.
- Uh, stop.

31:18.365 --> 31:20.644
You have got to stop
blocking your good.

31:20.668 --> 31:24.414
I don't care what
you're running from or to.

31:24.438 --> 31:27.717
But you and I, though,

31:27.741 --> 31:31.688
I just have this feeling
that we're destined to be.

31:31.712 --> 31:33.829
Okay.

31:42.690 --> 31:44.100
I can't believe I'm really here.

31:44.124 --> 31:47.337
I can hardly believe it myself.

31:47.361 --> 31:49.606
This where it all starts, Lala.

31:49.630 --> 31:52.876
So, today, you're going
to sing for us.

31:52.900 --> 31:56.112
Uh, just us, you know.
And it's unamplified,

31:56.136 --> 31:58.915
so why don't you just, like,
make yourself comfy

31:58.939 --> 32:01.390
and, you know, sing out?

32:03.110 --> 32:05.188
Oh, okay. Yes, you?

32:05.212 --> 32:08.291
I usually sing in the dark.

32:08.315 --> 32:12.262
That's no problem.
Hey, why don't you just...

32:12.286 --> 32:13.897
- Yeah.
- We'll draw the shades.

32:13.921 --> 32:15.098
No problem.

32:15.122 --> 32:17.067
We'll dim the lights.

32:17.091 --> 32:19.069
Let you get in your mood.

32:19.093 --> 32:22.105
And, um, could you both
turn around, please?

32:22.129 --> 32:25.308
I'm not used to people looking at me.

32:27.001 --> 32:28.979
Oh.

32:29.003 --> 32:31.081
But you were a YouTube
sensation, right?

32:31.105 --> 32:32.582
- That's what you said.
- She is.

32:32.606 --> 32:34.084
Four million views, right?

32:34.108 --> 32:37.254
Looking at you.
That's people that's looking.

32:37.278 --> 32:38.822
No problem. It's gonna be so good.

32:38.846 --> 32:41.391
Let's just do it.
Let's just, let's just do it.

32:41.415 --> 32:44.160
It's gonna be great. You got this.

32:44.184 --> 32:46.162
You realize how stupid this is?

32:46.186 --> 32:48.231
Shh. She is singing.

32:51.125 --> 32:54.804
No, she's not singing.

32:54.828 --> 32:56.973
Okay. La-Lala.

32:56.997 --> 32:59.175
Honey, can you just sing out?

32:59.199 --> 33:01.144
Like, "out" as in louder.

33:02.803 --> 33:04.180
- Is she sobbing?
- Yes.

33:04.204 --> 33:05.815
No, she's not... Oh.

33:05.839 --> 33:07.250
You realize you have signed us

33:07.274 --> 33:09.452
- a silent singer.
- Totally unamplified. God.

33:09.476 --> 33:11.454
No, no, no, no. I didn't... No,
no, no. This is not what I...

33:11.478 --> 33:14.324
Um, hey...

33:14.348 --> 33:16.593
Lala, what's, uh, what's happening?

33:16.617 --> 33:19.429
- What's going on?
- I-I only know how to sing in my bedroom.

33:19.453 --> 33:22.465
Oh, Lala, you signed a deal.

33:22.489 --> 33:24.134
Did you see "only sings

33:24.158 --> 33:26.269
in bedroom" anywhere in the contract?!

33:26.293 --> 33:29.606
Oh, no, no. I didn't mean to
yell. I was frus... I'm hungry.

33:29.630 --> 33:31.608
I hope you have
the receipts on this girl,

33:31.632 --> 33:33.643
because she has to go back.

33:37.705 --> 33:39.516
What are you so stressed about? Hmm?

33:39.540 --> 33:42.152
Well, I'm supposed to announce
the Empire film tonight,

33:42.176 --> 33:44.321
and I've got no star.

33:44.345 --> 33:46.823
That's the first thing
everybody's gonna want to know.

33:46.847 --> 33:50.860
Well, if you don't have
an answer, don't give one.

33:50.884 --> 33:53.135
Oh, Teri, it doesn't
work like that, baby.

33:54.054 --> 33:56.299
Okay.

33:56.323 --> 33:58.568
Let's pray about it, then.

34:01.595 --> 34:02.872
Teri...

34:02.896 --> 34:04.708
I don't remember how to pray.

34:04.732 --> 34:05.976
- Oh.
- I don't remember.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.811
I don't... Listen.

34:07.835 --> 34:10.013
- Ah.
- I've turned my back on God as many times

34:10.036 --> 34:11.915
as He's turned His back on me.

34:11.938 --> 34:13.416
So I must have forgot.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.491
He saved your life, Andre.

34:17.678 --> 34:19.194
I know you believe that.

34:20.947 --> 34:23.927
How can you not?

34:23.951 --> 34:25.228
Ooh.

34:25.252 --> 34:26.596
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

34:26.620 --> 34:28.063
- You okay?
- Uh, no, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

34:28.088 --> 34:32.202
It's just our little boy
is putting on weight.

34:32.226 --> 34:34.004
Well, Teri, if you're tired,
w-why don't you stay home

34:34.027 --> 34:36.172
- and get some rest?
- No, no, no. I-I'm coming out.

34:36.196 --> 34:38.007
- Teri, no, no. Teri?
- I want to...

34:38.032 --> 34:39.876
- I want to support you. I...
- No, no, no. Listen. No, no.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.844
I will be fine.

34:41.869 --> 34:43.346
Okay? I will go out there

34:43.370 --> 34:46.016
in front of all those people
and lie...

34:46.040 --> 34:47.516
- Lie? Lie?
- Yes, ma'am. I will,

34:47.541 --> 34:48.952
I will lie and tell them all

34:48.976 --> 34:50.553
we're having
a nationwide talent search

34:50.577 --> 34:52.022
to find the right Lucious.

34:52.045 --> 34:55.291
That's actually a great idea. A...

34:55.315 --> 34:57.594
A... Wait, a talent search?

34:57.618 --> 35:00.263
Baby, the press would run with that.

35:00.287 --> 35:02.298
Really.

35:02.322 --> 35:04.768
You know, you're right.

35:04.792 --> 35:07.303
You're right. My baby, the genius.

35:07.327 --> 35:09.205
Mwah.

35:09.229 --> 35:10.779
You see what God did?

35:12.666 --> 35:15.245
That's what we did, okay?

35:15.269 --> 35:17.080
- Mm.
- I love you.

35:17.104 --> 35:18.915
- I love you.
- Stay off your feet.

35:18.939 --> 35:20.550
I'll be back soon.

37:03.844 --> 37:07.090
It's a new day for Empire.

37:09.383 --> 37:13.062
Empire is stretching out
and holding new dreams.

37:13.086 --> 37:15.003
Fox Basketball.

37:16.523 --> 37:19.068
The new Empire movie.

37:20.460 --> 37:23.406
And as a part of that new day,

37:23.430 --> 37:25.575
I would like to announce

37:25.599 --> 37:31.281
that I am now
the new permanent CEO of Empire.

37:34.408 --> 37:35.618
Thank you. Thank you very much.

37:35.642 --> 37:37.053
Thank you so much.

37:37.077 --> 37:39.355
Thank you very much.

37:39.379 --> 37:40.690
And now I have
an exciting announcement

37:40.714 --> 37:41.958
about the Empire movie.

37:59.233 --> 38:01.411
"What the DJ Spins"?
It's like, why that?

38:01.435 --> 38:03.780
What the hell is Hakeem doing?

38:05.405 --> 38:06.616
I bet y'all didn't know

38:06.640 --> 38:08.952
we were doing an Empire movie,
did you?

38:10.644 --> 38:12.422
But wait!

38:12.446 --> 38:15.658
I'm playing my father, Lucious Lyon.

38:36.061 --> 38:37.551
You can't play Lucious.

38:37.552 --> 38:40.298
What? Bro, you hear the crowd?
They seem to think different.

38:40.322 --> 38:42.266
You don't get to make
those type of decisions, Hakeem.

38:42.290 --> 38:45.436
Decisions like
you being permanent CEO?

38:45.460 --> 38:47.972
You want me to back you up on that,

38:47.996 --> 38:50.546
back me up on this.

38:54.603 --> 38:57.982
You're on the Empire jet tonight.

38:58.006 --> 38:59.584
You'll work with the director
first thing in the morning.

38:59.608 --> 39:01.724
- Cool.
- Hakeem...

39:02.611 --> 39:04.527
You better deliver.

39:05.447 --> 39:07.563
Always.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.997
Wait a minute. Where you going?

39:13.021 --> 39:15.600
I'm calling my father. Shh.

39:15.624 --> 39:17.101
Hey, hey.

39:17.125 --> 39:18.502
Hi, Daddy.

39:18.526 --> 39:20.271
Hey, sweetheart, you good?

39:20.295 --> 39:22.907
I'm good. I'm just feeling,
um, a little stressed.

39:22.931 --> 39:25.243
I was, um, thinking about going back

39:25.267 --> 39:27.144
to the ashram in Delhi for a while,

39:27.168 --> 39:28.779
but I kind of can't afford it.

39:28.803 --> 39:30.248
What? Come on.

39:30.272 --> 39:32.250
You know you don't have
to worry about no money.

39:32.274 --> 39:34.018
I mean, the ashram works for you.

39:34.042 --> 39:35.953
I'll have Ray give you
whatever you need.

39:35.977 --> 39:37.455
Thanks, Dad.

39:37.479 --> 39:39.924
So, you sure you're okay, though?

39:39.948 --> 39:41.692
Yes, Dad, I'm fine.

39:41.716 --> 39:44.128
I don't believe in illness, remember?

39:44.152 --> 39:45.630
Well, good, then.
If you don't believe in it,

39:45.654 --> 39:47.098
I don't believe in it. I love you.

39:47.122 --> 39:48.599
Take care, baby girl. I love you.

39:48.623 --> 39:50.167
You said that already.

39:50.191 --> 39:51.669
It's late, and you're old.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.610
Go to bed.

39:55.530 --> 39:57.174
Voilà!

39:57.198 --> 39:58.643
Just like that?

39:58.667 --> 40:00.311
Yup.

40:00.335 --> 40:01.679
Hmm.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.114
You should meet him sometime.

40:03.138 --> 40:05.149
He's a real character.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.991
I bet he is.

40:28.563 --> 40:30.346
You owe me, bitch.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.811
Hey, babe,

40:33.835 --> 40:37.214
I was trying to wait up,
but I got to get to bed, so,

40:37.238 --> 40:39.684
just no rush.

40:39.708 --> 40:41.991
You know where to find me.

40:50.385 --> 40:52.502
You late.

40:53.588 --> 40:55.700
I told you I'd be here, man.
Chill out.

40:55.724 --> 40:57.902
- Where's my gig?
- What, you want me to pull your future

40:57.926 --> 41:00.371
out of my hat? That's what you want?

41:00.395 --> 41:02.440
I heard you out there tonight.

41:02.464 --> 41:05.910
You're Mr. Big Man, Mr. Empire.

41:05.934 --> 41:07.878
You're no better than me, Andre.

41:07.902 --> 41:09.714
I killed for you in prison.

41:09.738 --> 41:11.916
What-What...? What if I told
the world that, huh?

41:11.940 --> 41:13.351
Which would they hate most?

41:13.375 --> 41:17.121
The fact that you paid for murder,

41:17.145 --> 41:20.524
or the fact that the leader
of Empire got no balls?

41:20.548 --> 41:22.393
Get the hell out of my face, Mouse.

41:22.417 --> 41:24.295
Oh, or what? You're gonna
hire somebody to kill me?

41:24.319 --> 41:26.269
Huh?

41:36.264 --> 41:39.076
Should I carve you up,

41:39.100 --> 41:42.813
or should I wait and catch the wife?

41:42.837 --> 41:44.715
Oh, no.

41:44.739 --> 41:46.884
God. Oh, God.

41:46.908 --> 41:48.285
Maybe one day when you're at work...

41:48.309 --> 41:51.288
Son of a bitch!

42:07.429 --> 42:09.340
You're gonna kill who? Huh?

42:09.364 --> 42:11.075
Who you gonna kill?!

42:11.099 --> 42:13.277
Huh?! Huh?!

42:13.301 --> 42:15.279
Huh?

42:15.303 --> 42:16.747
Kill who?!

43:08.451 --> 43:09.601
