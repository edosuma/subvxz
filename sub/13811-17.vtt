{\an8}Come on, guys.

{\an8}Let's get to the shack.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.490
{\an8}Raymundo said he's
got a surprise for us.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.408
{\an8}I know you've all
been wondering

01:15.492 --> 01:17.577
{\an8}about this year's
summer vacation.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.746
{\an8}Well, I talked to
everyone's parents,

01:19.829 --> 01:21.831
{\an8}and we decided

01:21.915 --> 01:23.958
{\an8}an educational
trip would be

01:24.042 --> 01:25.585
{\an8}just the thing.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.795
{\an8}Uh-oh!

01:26.878 --> 01:28.004
{\an8}Copy that.

01:28.087 --> 01:32.050
{\an8}So, this year,
we're going to the Botany Museum

01:32.133 --> 01:34.344
{\an8}in Gopher City, Nebraska!

01:34.427 --> 01:35.887
{\an8}All right!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.181
{\an9}What?

01:38.264 --> 01:40.099
{\an8}It's supposed
to be awesome.

about three days
of intense mountain biking

01:50.819 --> 01:52.320

Grand Canyon!

01:53.863 --> 01:55.031
Unreal!

01:55.114 --> 01:57.575
I could catch the biggest air

with no shoobies.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.721
Well, we have to close down
for a few days.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.558
Tito found a colony of termites
under the stove.

You should have seen it.

in the fry bin...

02:25.103 --> 02:26.437

{\an1}Uh... I have some stuff
to do.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.068

I haven't seen that many colors

in the forehead.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.640
My Gung-Ho Gopher Survival Belt.

Got it for a dollar

Gopher is a cartoon,

04:28.267 --> 04:30.728
and a lame-o
one at that.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.980
It's not even
Japanese.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.941
Even I think it's dorky,
and that's saying a lot.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.276
It's not dorky.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.737
{\an1}They got all this cool stuff
about survival and junk.

{\an1}It's not like any of that stuff
he says is for real, Twist.

04:42.281 --> 04:43.783
Yeah, it is.
It has to be.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.035
There's a law.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.329
Hey, didn't you guys
used to watch that show?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.665
Yeah. When we were, like, eight.

Hey, I still love
that little fuzzy guy!

04:54.794 --> 04:57.213

out here is

a state-of-the-art electronic

04:59.173 --> 05:01.718
Dutch Army knife,
and global positioning system.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.886
There's practically nothing
it can't do.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.929
(<i> beeping</i> )

05:05.013 --> 05:07.890
I'll just stick with
my survival belt.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
Yeah! All right!
Let's tear it up!

05:10.476 --> 05:11.561
All right!

05:11.644 --> 05:12.895
Don't you think you
overpacked a bit?

Oh. You kidding?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.232
I'm traveling light.

05:16.315 --> 05:17.567
But don't worry.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.528
You'll still be eating my dust
on the trail.

05:20.611 --> 05:21.404
How am I going
to do that

05:21.487 --> 05:25.033
with you
behind me?

05:29.328 --> 05:31.456
{\an1}Man, look
at these shoobies.

This reeks!

05:32.874 --> 05:34.500
And so does Twister.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
What is that junk?

05:36.169 --> 05:39.088
One of the most important things
on my survival belt.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.173
Gung-Ho gopher always says,

05:40.256 --> 05:41.424
"Get the bugs
before they get you."

{\an5}<i>Ugh!</i>

That gopher have any advice
on getting rid of shoobies?

05:46.512 --> 05:48.389
We're tourists
here, too, Reggie.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.434
So, technically,
we're also shoobies.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.435
Hold up, guys.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.270
We should wait for
Raymundo and Tito.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.439

05:59.025 --> 06:00.943

06:01.027 --> 06:02.236
Huh!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.863
Is that all you got?

06:03.946 --> 06:05.073
I'm taking it easy

06:05.156 --> 06:07.408
{\an1}'cause you can't handle
all I got, brother.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.785
(<i> gasping for air</i> )

06:08.868 --> 06:10.286
{\an1}Looks like
they're pretty far behind.

06:10.369 --> 06:14.707
Huh. Some extreme adventure
this is turning out to be.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.876

Oh, my back!

06:16.959 --> 06:19.378

Buh! You back is
nothing on my feet.

What are you doing
over there, Twist?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.512
Gung-Ho Gopher says

06:27.595 --> 06:30.139
that if you face your
sleeping bag east,

06:30.223 --> 06:31.724
you won't be cold
in the morning.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.476
(<i> animal hooting</i> )

06:33.559 --> 06:34.811
What was that?

06:34.894 --> 06:37.230
S-something's out there.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.523
Mule deer.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.482
Huh?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.608
It's a mule deer.

06:40.691 --> 06:41.317
I saw fresh tracks earlier.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.318
Gung-Ho Gopher says

06:42.401 --> 06:44.403
lots of them live
in these parts.

(<i> gasps</i> )

07:01.087 --> 07:02.213
What was that?

07:02.296 --> 07:03.756
Coyote.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.007
Coyote?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.093
I didn't see that
in the safety pamphlet. Ugh!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.719
(<i> high-pitched squealing</i> )

07:08.803 --> 07:09.262
What about that?

07:09.345 --> 07:10.012
Bats.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.515
They feed at night.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.267

07:12.598 --> 07:14.267
What about that?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.351
Sorry.

07:15.434 --> 07:17.520
I had too much chili at dinner.

Come on, dudes. Let's move.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.451
Yeah, right.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.537
{\an1}As long as Ray
and Tito are with us,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.664
{\an1}moving is the last thing
we'll do.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.791
They probably just
needed to adjust

07:38.875 --> 07:41.752
to the lower oxygen levels
at this elevation.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.379
They should do better today.

Man,

08:05.818 --> 08:08.070
they're even slower today
than yesterday.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.322
Can you even see them?

08:09.405 --> 08:11.407
{\an1}Nope. They must have
dropped back.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.743
{\an1}Boy, they are really,
really, really,

08:13.826 --> 08:14.952
<i>really</i> far behind.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.538
Twist, your binoculars
are backwards.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.873
Oh.

08:18.956 --> 08:19.916
That's it.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.542
I say we go off-road
for a stretch

08:21.626 --> 08:23.336
and have some
fun for a change.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.587
I don't know.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.464
Aren't we supposed to stay
on the trail?

So what?

08:27.506 --> 08:28.716
We're experienced riders.

We'll just go off
a little ways.

What about
Raymundo and Tito?

08:32.845 --> 08:34.222
Are you kidding?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.682
We'll be back <i> way</i> before
those two ever show up.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.811
Let's go for it!

08:40.895 --> 08:41.854
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

08:41.938 --> 08:42.897
{\an1}Yeah!

09:51.215 --> 09:53.217
{\an3}Oh, no!

Sam! Sam, I'm gonna
throw you a rope!

09:55.678 --> 09:57.847

You gotta grab the rope,
Squid, or else!

Are you okay, Sammy?

(<i> shuddering</i> ):
Yeah, but that was close.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.662
You guys...

10:21.746 --> 10:23.372
{\an1}you guys saved me
from biting the big one.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.666
No thanks to Twist.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.709
What is your problem?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.461
Did you want Squid
to drown?

10:28.544 --> 10:29.378
No, but...

10:29.462 --> 10:31.005
Then what did you want me for?

10:31.088 --> 10:31.881
Well, I...

10:31.964 --> 10:34.633
Ahoy! Gung-Ho Gopher here.

Help!

10:38.304 --> 10:43.225
{\an5}Looks like Scaredy Skunk
has fallen into the drink again.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.063
{\an5}Here's what not to do:
don't panic! Just...

10:47.146 --> 10:48.230
Can it, Twister.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.273
{\an1}Give the lame gopher thing
a rest, will ya?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.567
{\an3}But...

10:51.650 --> 10:52.651
{\an4}Forget about it,
Twister.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.651
(<i> shivering</i> )

10:52.735 --> 10:54.445
{\an1}Right now, we gotta

What do you have
to say about that?

11:08.250 --> 11:11.545
{\an4}(<i> gasping</i> ):
I'd say you
have heatstroke.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.589
I don't see the
kids anywhere.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.091
Maybe they went ahead.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.926
Let's see if we
can catch up to them.

11:17.009 --> 11:17.927
What's that?

11:18.010 --> 11:18.803
Where?

11:18.886 --> 11:19.220
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

Hey!

11:21.680 --> 11:24.266
(<i> both breathing heavily</i> )

11:26.560 --> 11:29.021
{\an1}So, how do we get back
to the trail?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.148
{\an1}Sammy's GPS was washed away
with his backpack!

Bah!

Bah!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.285
Oh-oh!

11:43.369 --> 11:46.455
{\an5}Looks like Goofus Goat
is lost again--

11:46.539 --> 11:49.291
and running all over creation.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.418
Bah-d move.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.461
Here's what you do!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.338
Maybe we should just...
stay where we are?

11:54.422 --> 11:56.507
{\an3}What?

11:56.590 --> 11:58.259
Well, I saw this
Gung-Ho Gopher episode

11:58.342 --> 12:00.302
where Goofus Goat
got lost, and...

12:00.386 --> 12:05.683
Wait! Did you just say
that Goofus Goat was lost?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.852
(<i> sarcastic</i> ):
Oh, no. How awful!

12:07.935 --> 12:09.103
Ease up, Otto.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.147
We'll just ride back
along the riverbanks

12:11.230 --> 12:12.314
and pick up the trail.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.399
It's a no-brainer.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.401
Wait. Did anyone
find my glasses?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.027
Sorry, Sam, no luck.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.863
{\an1}I'll ride
alongside you,

12:18.946 --> 12:21.824
{\an1}so you don't take
another unexpected swim.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.825
Thanks, Reg.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.243
{\an3}I'm Otto.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.079
Reg is over there.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.957

anywhere, Tito?

12:39.758 --> 12:41.260
Negatory, Raymundo.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.470
I think it's time

12:42.553 --> 12:46.849
{\an1}I used my mystic
Hawaiian tracking skills.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.933
What are you...?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.019
Shh! I'm listening
to the wind.

12:50.102 --> 12:50.978
What's it
telling you?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.939
They're around
here somewhere.

I'm okay, Reg.

{\an1}Admit it, Otto: you have
no clue where we are.

exactly where we are.

{\an1}Then why did you
shush me?

18:17.805 --> 18:20.516
and move over by those rocks,
so you can stay warm after dark.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.018
{\an1}Good idea.

18:23.101 --> 18:25.229
{\an1}Guess I'll try to get up high,
so I can see where we are.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.605
Don't worry
about us.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.023
I'll protect the others
if anything happens.

18:28.106 --> 18:30.484
I know you can do it, Twist.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.652
Me, too.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.319
You'll get us home.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.904
Okay. See you.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.532
We're toast, aren't we?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.116
Yup.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.416
(<i> groaning</i> )

18:56.885 --> 18:58.262
I'm really thirsty.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.472
Is there any water left?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.773
Reg, I want you to have my
boards and my music collection.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.484
Thanks, Rocket Boy...

19:12.568 --> 19:15.737
{\an1}but I think you're forgetting
that <i> I'm</i> gonna be history, too?

19:15.821 --> 19:16.488
Oh. Right.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.781
(<i> loud crack</i> )

19:17.865 --> 19:18.699
Is that thunder?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.368
I think that's
lightning.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.627
(<i> thunder rumbles</i> )

19:33.297 --> 19:34.590
(<i> shivering</i> )

19:34.673 --> 19:36.925
We should hug for warmth.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.596
It's a good thing
we're not going to make it.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.932
Otherwise, I'd never
live this down.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.313
Good-bye, world.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.316
(<i> whirring</i> )

19:52.399 --> 19:53.442
It's a helicopter!

19:56.904 --> 19:58.780
They can't see us
under the shelter!

19:58.864 --> 19:59.990
We got to make
a run for it.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.534
Otto, put your hands
over our shoulders.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.994
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:09.791 --> 20:11.293
(<i> whirring</i> )

20:11.376 --> 20:15.339
I don't believe it! He did it!

20:15.422 --> 20:16.965
Way to go, Dad.

20:17.049 --> 20:21.595
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna <i> live.</i>

20:28.185 --> 20:29.645
You guys okay?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.480
{\an5}(<i> laughs</i> ):
Yeah. A little
banged up, though.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.190
Going off-road like that
and getting lost

20:33.273 --> 20:35.317
was just about the dumbest thing
you guys have ever done!

20:35.400 --> 20:36.735
You know that, don't you?

20:38.236 --> 20:39.696
Oh, I was so worried.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.198
Thanks for
saving us, Dad.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.116
We really thought
our time was up.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.535
Don't thank me. Thank Twister.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.287
OTTO:
Twister?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.706
Yeah. He climbed up
to the ridge,

20:49.790 --> 20:52.084
so we could see his signal
from the helicopter.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.168
What signal?

20:53.251 --> 20:55.045
{\an1}It's granite
filled with quartz.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.296
It reflects light.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.881
Gung-Ho Gopher used it
to send an SOS signal

20:57.965 --> 21:00.008
when he was stranded

21:00.092 --> 21:02.344
{\an1}on the Island
of the Bone-headed Beavers.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.304
Well, at least you
did one thing right.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.140
He still almost
got Squid killed.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.976
Squid fell in the river,
and he tackled me

21:09.059 --> 21:10.852
when I was holding out
a branch for him.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.313
Never toss an object
to someone in distress

21:13.397 --> 21:14.606
while holding
onto the other end!

21:14.690 --> 21:17.985
The force of the river
could pull you in, too.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.445
<i>"Gung-Ho Gopher</i>
<i>and the Pea-Brained Polecat,"</i>

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
season two.

21:23.240 --> 21:23.991
Hey, almost forgot.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.410
My survival belt!

21:26.493 --> 21:28.203
Forgive me, Gung-Ho Gopher.

21:28.286 --> 21:32.207
It'll never happen again.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.250
My glasses!

21:33.333 --> 21:36.086
Found them near
the riverbed.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.755
We'd have found you guys, too,
if you'd have stayed put.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.259
{\an1}I think Twister might've
mentioned something about that.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.095
You totally came
through, Twist.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.555
You saved our lives.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.389
I did, didn't I?

21:47.472 --> 21:48.390
That was so cool.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.850
I saved your lives.

21:49.933 --> 21:52.644
With a little help
from Gung-Ho Gopher, of course.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.189
How many box-tops you need for
one of those survival belts?

21:56.273 --> 21:58.650
I wonder if they make one
in my size.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.901
By the way, Tito,

21:59.985 --> 22:01.153
what was that ultimate
tracking technique

22:01.236 --> 22:03.905
you used to signal the chopper?

22:03.989 --> 22:07.576
Ah, yes,<i> wakapuwakihi.</i>

22:07.659 --> 22:10.746
Cell phone, brudda!

22:10.829 --> 22:15.042
(<i> laughter</i> )

22:23.091 --> 22:25.385
See you around, Junior Gophers!
