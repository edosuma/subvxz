WEBVTT

00:12.403 --> 00:14.405
Flight getting canceled
was not my fault.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.928
So you say.

00:16.103 --> 00:18.235
Cynthia, I didn't create
a tropical depression

00:18.409 --> 00:19.497
over the Gulf of Mexico.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.195
Maybe you manifested it.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.109
You would do anything
to get out of spending

00:22.283 --> 00:23.371
a week with my mother.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.551
I love your mother.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.293
Ish.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.339
Oh, no, not again.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.733
Lucas, did you close
all the windows

00:37.907 --> 00:38.995
before we left, like I asked?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.649
Of course, dear.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.651
Well, then how did
the neighbor's cat get in again?

00:42.825 --> 00:44.435
Oh, my God.

00:44.566 --> 00:45.697
Nana's vase.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.309
That is it.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.962
- Where are you going?
- I am going

00:50.137 --> 00:50.789
full Karen on the neighbors!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.487
They need to leash that furball!

00:52.661 --> 00:53.662
We don't have proof
that it was the Nelsons' cat.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.185
Yes, we do.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.885
See? It sensed motion
right before we came in.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.365
It's that damn cat.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.893
Babe, that's not a cat.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.374
Oh, my God,
somebody was in our house.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.160
Cynthia, I didn't create
a tropical depression

01:13.334 --> 01:14.683
over the Gulf
of Mexico.

01:14.813 --> 01:16.206
Maybe you manifested it.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.164
You would do anything
to get out of spending

01:17.338 --> 01:18.382
a week with my mother.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.601
I love your mother.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.124
He still is.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.604
Oh, no, not again.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.168
Well, I got to say,
today was a pretty good day.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.039
Yeah, no murders.
No one missing.

02:07.214 --> 02:10.565
I got to re-sand my Zen garden,
which was looking not so Zen.

02:10.739 --> 02:13.045
Hey, I say we slip out early.
I got big plans.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.570
Sounds good.
I've got plans, too.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.311
Oh, you go first. What you got?

02:17.485 --> 02:18.877
Well, I plan on
being in bed by 9:00.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.749
Kasie and I got these Halo Views

02:20.879 --> 02:22.577
that give you a
nightly sleep score.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.231
And Kasie got a 91
the other night.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.363
And I plan on getting a 92.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.931
Wow. How incredibly exciting.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.500
I have someplace to be as well.

02:32.674 --> 02:33.501
Let me guess--

02:33.675 --> 02:35.981
in bed by 8:30

02:36.112 --> 02:37.548
and you're going
for a 93?

02:37.679 --> 02:40.551
No. Delilah and I have a meeting
at Morgan's preschool.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.596
Is everything okay?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.467
Yes and no.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.253
See, Morgan's been insisting
on wearing a, uh,

02:46.427 --> 02:48.646
princess dress to school
every single day.

02:48.820 --> 02:49.908
Well, that's adorable.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.433
You know, when I was her age,

02:52.607 --> 02:53.869
I wore a mask

02:54.043 --> 02:55.436
and carried
a spatula everywhere.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.133
I made my mom call me Zorro.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.614
I turned out
just fine.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.616
- That's debatable.
- Come on.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.313
But, seriously,
a cute little

03:03.487 --> 03:05.010
princess dress--
that's harmless enough, yeah?

03:05.141 --> 03:06.882
Well, the school's saying
that there's peer issues,

03:07.056 --> 03:08.275
and, you know, I don't want
her getting picked on.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.233
Wait, but didn't
you used to wear

03:10.364 --> 03:12.061
a magician outfit all the
time when you were a kid?

03:12.235 --> 03:13.410
Yeah, and I got picked on.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.238
I bet you looked
good in a top hat.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.022
Thank you. But we were
on my father's O-3 salary,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.154
so top hats were

03:18.285 --> 03:19.895
kind of a luxury.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.723
Maybe you're
overreacting?

03:21.897 --> 03:23.551
You sound like Delilah.

03:23.725 --> 03:24.856
She thinks that Morgan's
just going through a phase.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.684
I'm Team Delilah
on this.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.687
Yeah, me, too. I mean,
let Morgan have some fun.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.257
Whoa. Where's everybody going?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.825
Well, um...
Knight's going to sleep,

03:36.955 --> 03:39.480
I'm going to a concert,
and McGee is...

03:39.654 --> 03:40.829
he's being McGee.

03:42.439 --> 03:43.614
Any plans tonight, Parker?

03:43.745 --> 03:45.399
Yeah. In Norfolk.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.401
- What's in Norfolk?
- The four of us,

03:47.575 --> 03:49.446
investigating a break-in
on base housing.

03:57.106 --> 03:59.543
It all happenedso fast.

03:59.717 --> 04:00.544
Move!

04:01.719 --> 04:03.199
No! Lucas!

04:04.766 --> 04:06.463
You know what?
- You're lucky.
- Yeah.

04:06.637 --> 04:07.595
We could've been killed.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.902
- Anything taken?
- Uh, no.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.687
Anyone know you're supposed
to be out of town?

04:12.861 --> 04:15.080
Command knew
that I was taking leave.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.517
But I'm not surprised
this happened.

04:16.691 --> 04:17.431
I've heard there's been
a string of break-ins

04:17.561 --> 04:18.519
on base lately.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.650
Well, not just lately.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.391
There's one happening right now.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.219
That was Torres.
He's with base security.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.700
They just got a report of a
suspicious man entering a home.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.136
- Where?
- Two minutes from here.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.181
McGee's on his way
there now.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.792
You want to go open
a can of whup-ass on this guy?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.228
Works for me.

04:32.402 --> 04:33.055
All right, we'll be in touch.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.235
What do we know, McGee?

04:39.409 --> 04:40.671
McNeighbors haven't seen
anyone come out.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.107
I got the back.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.761
Suspect could
still be inside.

04:43.935 --> 04:44.675
Assume he's armed.

04:44.849 --> 04:45.937
In position.

04:46.111 --> 04:47.287
We got the front.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.679
Door's open.

05:03.259 --> 05:04.129
Clear.

05:05.783 --> 05:06.610
What was that?

05:06.784 --> 05:08.133
Silencer?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.831
It's coming from the basement.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.050
That's fresh blood.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.684
NCIS!

05:36.858 --> 05:38.773
Five-O! Run!

05:43.952 --> 05:45.780
Stop! No one's going anywhere.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.708
I'm just saying,

06:00.882 --> 06:03.058
who breaks into somebody's
house to have a party?

06:03.232 --> 06:05.756
I never did anything like that
when I lived on base.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.236
And where were
those kids' parents?

06:07.410 --> 06:09.456
And it took forever, man.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.675
I was at security
until 1:00 in the morning,

06:11.849 --> 06:13.285
waiting for these brats
to get picked up.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.245
I'm jealous. We were processing
vomit at Casa Party.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.247
I'm a federal agent, man.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.596
I'm not a babysitter.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.468
Hey. Good news.
The blood

06:21.642 --> 06:23.774
you found on the carpet--
rhinovirus DNA confirms

06:23.905 --> 06:25.254
that it was a nosebleed.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.473
You know, kids--

06:26.647 --> 06:28.953
notoriously thin capillaries.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.477
Fascinating.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.305
I don't know how you
guys can be so grumpy.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.220
We have free breakfast
right here.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.701
I got a sleep score of 42
last night.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.094
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
more than a babka

06:39.268 --> 06:41.879
to make up for missing
my first concert in two years.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.446
Yeah, and I missed
my parent-teacher conference,

06:43.620 --> 06:46.318
so Delilah let Morgan wear
the dress again.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.146
God, is that
where this is headed?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.018
One day, your daughter's
wearing her princess dress,

06:50.148 --> 06:51.367
won't take it off. Next day,

06:51.541 --> 06:53.021
she's committing
felony trespassing?

06:53.195 --> 06:55.850
Okay, yeah, grumpy it is.

06:56.024 --> 06:56.938
We got bigger problems

06:57.112 --> 06:59.027
than a dress right now anyway.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.420
Not that your home situation

07:00.594 --> 07:01.856
- isn't important.
- But...

07:02.030 --> 07:04.119
I just spoke
to the Norfolk base commander.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.730
There's been six break-ins
in the last three months.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.907
And why is this our problem
and not base security's?

07:10.081 --> 07:13.520
Because the doors at Norfolk
unlock via QR codes

07:13.694 --> 07:15.173
that refresh every 20 minutes.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.827
The only way
to get into a resident's home

07:16.958 --> 07:18.394
is either break in

07:18.525 --> 07:20.352
or with one
of those codes.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.919
And there were no signs
of a break-in.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.181
Which means what?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.621
To be honest, I didn't hear
anything after "QR codes."

07:27.751 --> 07:30.493
It means that someone
hacked into the base's

07:30.624 --> 07:33.975
central security system
and generated fake codes.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.977
That's a pretty serious
security breach.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.109
And pretty impressive
for a bunch of teenagers.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.676
We need to get them in here

07:39.850 --> 07:41.461
and find out
how they hacked the system

07:41.635 --> 07:43.637
before the base's
security is breached

07:43.811 --> 07:45.639
for something far worse
than a house party.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.076
Start with that kid
on the nanny cam.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.775
Thanks for bringing him in,
Mrs. Richter.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.125
Of course. We've got
nothing to hide.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.300
Noah's a good kid.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.998
More of a follower, though.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.695
I'm sure
he just got swept up

07:58.869 --> 08:00.654
in whatever
the cool kids were doing.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.220
Noah,

08:02.394 --> 08:04.005
please answer the question
with something

08:04.179 --> 08:06.442
- other than a grunt.
- Huh.

08:08.009 --> 08:10.185
It was a party.
Not like we hurt anyone.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.969
None of your friends
hurt anyone.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.797
But you did.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.932
You're on video,
attacking a petty officer.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.499
That's not me.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.504
You are literally still wearing
the same sweatshirt.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.680
For the record, none
of the, uh, cool kids

08:26.810 --> 08:28.246
committed
felony assault.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.119
That little...

08:31.249 --> 08:33.164
Excuse me.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.778
Should I go get her?

08:37.908 --> 08:39.170
No, no, no, no. Let
her go. Let her go.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.913
Noah Patrick
Henry Richter,

08:43.087 --> 08:45.350
you better sit up straight
and put that listening cap on!

08:45.481 --> 08:47.439
- Yes, ma'am.
- I will take your phone,

08:47.614 --> 08:50.530
sell your laptop and
melt your PlayStation

08:50.704 --> 08:52.532
unless you tell me everything!

08:52.706 --> 08:54.882
- The parties were my idea.
- What?!

08:55.056 --> 08:57.145
We need to bring in
suspects' parents more often.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.060
Good cop, mom cop.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.801
We were just trying
to have some fun.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.498
What kind of fun

09:02.672 --> 09:06.241
were you having in the
Monizes' house alone?

09:06.415 --> 09:08.504
I was pre-scouting
for the party that night.

09:10.114 --> 09:13.553
How did you get the QR codes
to enter the houses?

09:13.727 --> 09:16.468
I found, um...

09:16.643 --> 09:19.820
a backdoor channel
and hacked into the multi-net.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.953
Son, I love you,

09:23.084 --> 09:24.825
but you're not
even smart enough

09:24.955 --> 09:27.262
to take off the clothes
you committed a crime in.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.394
You've been wearing the
same hoodie for a week.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.005
Oh, my God. That <i>
is</i> how it starts.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.963
You couldn't hack
a thing.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.791
Who are you covering for, Noah?

09:34.965 --> 09:36.401
No one.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.012
It's that girl, isn't it?

09:39.143 --> 09:40.362
What girl?

09:40.536 --> 09:42.059
Teagan something.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.844
He's been in love with her
since the moment

09:44.018 --> 09:45.802
she moved in three months ago.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.503
We've got a Teagan Fields
in the conference room.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.027
She was supposed to be
at a sleepover last night

09:53.201 --> 09:54.855
when she snuck out
for the party.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.770
Still waiting
for her guardians to arrive.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.902
All right. Let's go
introduce ourselves.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.256
Teagan. Hi.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.910
I'm Agent McGee.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.564
Can I go now?

10:11.262 --> 10:15.615
Um, we can only release you
to a parent or a guardian.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.834
Because your mom
is on deployment,

10:18.008 --> 10:19.488
your uncle is
on the way.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.055
So I'm stuck here.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.277
And my phone's at three percent.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.714
Just kill me now.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.498
Or we could just
get you a charger.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.588
Finally. A useful adult.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.112
After you tell us
about the parties.

10:35.243 --> 10:38.638
So, a few of us base kids
hung out in some empty houses.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.727
- Sue us.
- Funny,

10:40.901 --> 10:42.816
the residents
might do just that.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.688
Your boyfriend Noah
said that you were the one

10:45.819 --> 10:47.821
that hacked into
the keyless entry system.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.476
Ew. Noah's not my boyfriend.

10:51.607 --> 10:52.913
No? Then why did
he cover for you?

10:53.087 --> 10:54.871
He likes me.

10:55.045 --> 10:57.439
He's sweet,
but kind of mid, you know?

11:02.487 --> 11:05.142
This is my boyfriend. Jayden.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.231
He's valid.

11:13.498 --> 11:17.024
So, um, Teagan,
hacking into the, uh,

11:17.198 --> 11:19.504
base server, that's, uh,
that's pretty impressive.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.550
JavaScript or Python?

11:21.724 --> 11:24.771
Neither. C programming
all the way.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.208
Yeah, you don't find that
too restrictive?

11:27.382 --> 11:30.559
Python and Java may seem easier,
but only 'cause they hide

11:30.733 --> 11:33.127
their complexities
from the Luddite users.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.085
Ouch.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.000
I'm-a go get that charger.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.615
Teagan, how long
you been a hacker?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.140
I prefer
"open source developer."

11:46.314 --> 11:48.533
And as long as I've
been a military brat.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.492
Seven schools in four years.

11:50.666 --> 11:51.711
12 in six for me.

11:53.495 --> 11:54.888
Got me beat.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.804
It was, uh,

11:57.978 --> 12:00.110
it was my father's world,
I was just living in it.

12:00.284 --> 12:02.939
For me, it's my mom.
I'm pretty much invisible.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.812
I was always, uh,
jealous of those kids

12:05.986 --> 12:07.291
that didn't have
to move around a lot.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.467
Yeah. Must be nice.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.034
Teagan,

12:11.208 --> 12:13.167
we really need to know
how you hacked

12:13.341 --> 12:15.822
into the base's
central security system.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.741
I used a backdoor-embedding
algorithm

12:21.915 --> 12:24.178
to bypass the
detection subroutine

12:24.352 --> 12:26.397
in the keyless
entry app's code.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.965
You exploited a flaw
in the system.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.185
I can open almost
any door on base.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.013
Or even hack
visitor logs

12:33.143 --> 12:35.798
to generate access codes
and get someone on base.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.713
Okay, Teagan,
you know that you created

12:37.887 --> 12:39.802
a major security hazard, right?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.499
No one knows
the algorithm but me.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.023
You sure about that?

12:43.197 --> 12:44.851
A hundred percent.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.810
And last night was
my last party, obviously,

12:47.984 --> 12:49.594
so we good?

12:49.769 --> 12:50.900
Not good.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.990
Agent McGee.

13:03.304 --> 13:04.609
Base commander just called.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.741
There was another
break-in last night

13:05.872 --> 13:07.525
- on base housing.
- Another party?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.223
I don't think so.

13:09.397 --> 13:10.659
It happened after
all the kids were in custody.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.704
But the same
QR code hack was used.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.490
Well, Teagan says she's the only
one that knows that algorithm.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.232
Well, either she's lying
and shared it with someone...

13:18.406 --> 13:20.016
Or someone stole it from her.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.889
She hacked into a military base.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.760
She is not the victim here.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.631
Well, I don't know,
maybe she is.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.372
I don't know,

13:28.546 --> 13:30.287
she sounds pretty alone.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.028
I could relate
to that at her age.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.682
We're not that different.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.424
You weren't
a terrorist hacker as a teen.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.992
Yeah, but why? What makes the
difference between me and her?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.429
You mean, did Teagan's parents
let her wear

13:41.559 --> 13:42.647
the same Cure T-shirt
over and over?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.650
Kinda. Yeah.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.696
And she's not
a terrorist.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.263
Okay? They were just
trying to have some fun.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.134
Well, they had fun.

13:51.308 --> 13:52.657
And now somebody
has the master key

13:52.832 --> 13:54.485
to our base at Norfolk.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.661
Parker and I are
gonna go check it out.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.709
Resident is
Lieutenant Carl Tang.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.929
Came home from leave
this morning.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.626
Could tell somebody
was in his house.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.497
And we know it
wasn't the kids.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.673
Well, doesn't mean
they weren't involved.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.980
Well, McGee sure seems to think
that Teagan is innocent, though.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.026
Yeah, 'cause he relates to her.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.028
I take it you don't?

14:15.202 --> 14:17.030
Well, my dad dragged me all over
the world, too, with his career,

14:17.160 --> 14:19.162
but I didn't turn out
to be a teenage menace.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.861
Oh, we all can't be like
the great Jessica Knight.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.819
Oh, that's right.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.821
You were a teenage
menace, too.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.302
I straightened myself out eventually.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.086
Hopefully,
Teagan will do the same.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.914
Yeah, that's what McGee
says, but we all know

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
this is how it
starts, and then...

14:49.497 --> 14:50.890
Mc
Lieutenant Carl Tang.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.544
Surface warfare officer.
Lived alone.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.416
Neighbors say he was quiet.

14:55.590 --> 14:58.071
Liked to spend his free time
at a base hobby club.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.726
Nice. Homemade camera
from an old tin can.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.206
This man was an inventor.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.816
Maybe this was an accident.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.210
Something, uh, Tang
was working on exploded?

15:07.384 --> 15:10.170
Right after his house got
broken into? Coincidence?

15:10.300 --> 15:13.347
I think your former boss
had a rule against them.

15:13.521 --> 15:16.916
But that Rule 62?
That man was ahead of his time.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.137
I do my homework.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.793
Got something.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.753
I don't think this wiring
is part of the TV.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.018
It looks like
some kind of detonator.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.934
Clever. Inside the TV.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.110
Probably used
the remote as a trigger.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.896
Tang was targeted.
Why?

15:41.070 --> 15:42.680
Well, it was Teagan's algorithm
that opened the door.

15:42.811 --> 15:43.943
Let's ask her.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.248
Well, I can talk to her again,

15:45.422 --> 15:46.902
but she's not big on sharing.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.165
Try not to get eaten alive.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.775
Knight, you're with me.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.126
Let's go check out
Lieutenant Tang's hobby club.

15:55.998 --> 15:56.956
Excuse me, ladies.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.132
Agent Parker, NCIS.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.481
This is Agent Knight.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.786
This your club?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.440
Oh, it's everybody's club.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.269
Claudia.
Aviation electrician's mate.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.618
Retired.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.404
Ramona. I was a Seabee

16:10.578 --> 16:11.274
for 20 years.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.929
I oversee builds.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.278
You mind if we ask you
a few questions

16:15.452 --> 16:17.019
about one of your
fellow members?

16:17.193 --> 16:19.369
You can ask me anything.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.110
Ditto. I'm an open book.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.113
You can pick
the genre.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.420
Feel free to read
as much as you'd like.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.640
Looks like you
have this handled.

16:31.599 --> 16:32.643
Did we get

16:32.817 --> 16:34.080
your first name?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.733
Alden.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.692
Oh, did anyone ever tell you

16:37.866 --> 16:41.043
that you have
fantastic hair, Alden?

16:42.479 --> 16:44.264
Uh, Lieutenant Tang.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.440
Did you know him by any chance?

16:46.614 --> 16:49.834
Did? Is Carl okay?

16:49.965 --> 16:53.795
There was, uh, an explosion
on base this morning.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.492
That was Carl's house?

16:55.666 --> 16:58.278
Oh, no, he was the sweetest man.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.628
You notice anything off
about him recently?

17:00.802 --> 17:02.499
Uh, any unusual behavior?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.675
Well, now that
you mention it, yeah.

17:04.849 --> 17:06.547
He's been pretty stressed
since he started

17:06.721 --> 17:08.940
his shore assignment.

17:09.115 --> 17:12.248
He used to come here
every night to unwind.

17:12.422 --> 17:18.080
What do you like to do
to unwind after work, Alden?

17:18.211 --> 17:21.866
Yeah, people always say it,
but he was a really nice guy.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.086
Nice enough for someone
to plant a bomb in his house?

17:24.217 --> 17:26.001
I assume you checked
his Footman.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.829
Tang had a-a servant?

17:28.003 --> 17:29.004
On a military base?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.311
No, the Footman 7000.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.139
It was
his pride and joy.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.532
H-He took an off-the-shelf
security system

17:35.706 --> 17:38.492
and modified it with
an integrated CRM platform.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.624
Right.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.757
Which would do what?

17:42.931 --> 17:46.761
I-It used an
A.I. to learn about his guests.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.938
Their preferred air temp,
their musical tastes,

17:50.112 --> 17:52.114
even their biometric data.

17:52.245 --> 17:53.681
Housed it
in a robotic platform

17:53.811 --> 17:55.770
that would greet people
as they walked in.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.467
Wow, that's creepy.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.513
If you can find it,
it might have recorded

17:59.687 --> 18:02.255
all sorts of data
on who was in his house.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.307
Is my uncle here yet?

18:11.481 --> 18:14.049
Yeah, he pulled
into the parking lot.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.182
- Great, so can I go now?
- No.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.880
No, I, um, I needed
to talk to you first.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.447
It'll be quick.

18:20.621 --> 18:21.883
Okay. What?

18:22.057 --> 18:23.319
This man.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.192
Lieutenant Tang.
Do you know him?

18:26.366 --> 18:28.063
Never heard of him.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.109
Somebody broke into his house
and planted a bomb.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.287
What's that have to do with me?

18:34.417 --> 18:37.116
They used your algorithm
to get inside.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.334
Now he's dead.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.249
Wait.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.425
You think I had something
to do with this?

18:42.599 --> 18:43.905
That's not what I'm saying.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.385
Then what are you saying?

18:45.559 --> 18:49.519
I'm saying that I think

18:49.650 --> 18:52.609
maybe you're not being
completely honest with me.

18:52.783 --> 18:56.178
You're just like everyone else.
You don't get it.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.094
You're right. There's a lot
about kids I don't get.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.401
Like why my four-year-old
insists on wearing

19:01.575 --> 19:04.012
a princess dress
every day.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.883
You're comparing me
to a four-year-old?

19:06.014 --> 19:07.755
No.

19:07.885 --> 19:11.585
No, I'm just saying, maybe today
it's princess dresses,

19:11.759 --> 19:14.805
and tomorrow it's hacking
government buildings.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.766
Maybe you should listen
to what she wants.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.507
I do.

19:20.681 --> 19:21.682
Whatever.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.250
Hey.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.469
Right now I'm listening to you.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.515
And if you tell me

19:28.689 --> 19:30.604
that you didn't give
this algorithm to anyone, fine.

19:30.778 --> 19:34.695
But maybe there's something that
you don't know but you know.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.131
You know what I'm saying?

19:36.305 --> 19:38.046
Just start
from the beginning.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.569
Why did you hack
the base server?

19:39.700 --> 19:40.744
What did you want?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.272
To fit in.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.926
You seem pretty popular to me.

19:51.277 --> 19:55.759
I was a total hermit
before I met Jayden on BratChat.

19:55.933 --> 20:00.373
Is that the social media app
that you military kids use?

20:00.547 --> 20:02.723
I wish I had something
like that when I was your age.

20:02.897 --> 20:05.639
We, like, instantly clicked.

20:07.945 --> 20:10.600
He saw how lonely I was,
he convinced me to hang out

20:10.731 --> 20:12.428
with some of the other
base kids.

20:15.518 --> 20:18.478
I finally have friends here,
Agent McGee.

20:18.652 --> 20:20.306
I'm happy.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.744
I didn't have anything
to do with that explosion.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.659
I believe you.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.098
You find Tang's robot friend?

20:30.272 --> 20:33.057
No security system
of any kind inside the house.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.711
Could've been destroyed
in the blast.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.017
Or maybe someone stole it.

20:36.191 --> 20:38.062
Well, if I was the killer,

20:38.193 --> 20:39.890
I sure wouldn't leave behind any
kind of incriminating evidence.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.327
All right, so let's try motive,

20:41.501 --> 20:43.372
which we are, uh,
sorely missing.

20:43.546 --> 20:44.765
So, Tang recently returned

20:44.939 --> 20:46.941
from his third sea tour.

20:47.115 --> 20:47.898
CO said his transition

20:48.072 --> 20:50.553
to shore was rocky.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.034
Claudia did say that he was
having a difficult time at work.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.514
And who's Claudia?

20:54.688 --> 20:57.647
President of the Alden Parker
Fan Club.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.345
Oh, I need to hear
this story.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.476
Hey, wait.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.565
Did either of you see a safe

21:02.739 --> 21:04.567
inside of the house,
by any chance?

21:04.741 --> 21:06.003
Don't think so. Why?

21:06.177 --> 21:08.528
Surface warfare officers
work with ONR

21:08.658 --> 21:11.313
on experimental weapons,
so he would have access

21:11.487 --> 21:13.097
to some pretty
sensitive information.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.969
And he'd want
to keep that secure.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.363
Yeah, weapons intel
could sell for big bucks

21:17.537 --> 21:19.147
on the underground
arms market.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.500
Hold on. Go back one.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.895
There. Indentations
in the carpet.

21:28.025 --> 21:30.289
Okay, if that was a safe,
it's missing now.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.116
And whatever's inside of it.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.249
So, who are we looking for?

21:34.380 --> 21:36.295
Foreign intelligence service,

21:36.469 --> 21:37.513
maybe an arms dealer.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.341
And a lead is flying in

21:39.515 --> 21:41.387
as we speak.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.476
What, is the elevator
down again?

21:43.650 --> 21:45.347
I wouldn't know.
I took the stairs

21:45.521 --> 21:48.176
to boost my Halo
activity score for the week.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.397
Which I am crushing, by the way.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.008
Kasie's beating you
on sleep and activity?

21:54.182 --> 21:55.531
It's not a contest.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.186
Yeah, except for the part
where it's a contest.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.796
How many points
you got there, Jess?

21:59.970 --> 22:02.016
Okay, can we get to the
point of your visit?

22:02.190 --> 22:05.628
Ah, I am also crushing
my case-solving score.

22:07.500 --> 22:11.460
Ah, someone just listed an item
matching the description

22:11.634 --> 22:14.637
of Lieutenant Tang's
creepy little robot butler.

22:14.811 --> 22:18.206
Well, maybe whoever has that
also has our mystery safe.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.556
Can you track down
the seller's GPS?

22:20.730 --> 22:23.080
Is my activity score
through the roof right now?

22:26.823 --> 22:29.522
KNIGHT:Robot guy should be
right over here.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.528
Well, that doesn't
look obvious at all.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.879
Look at that bootleg WALL-E.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.535
Federal agents.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.146
Gonna need both of you to
step against the wall, please.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.758
Hey, we were just talking.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.151
NCIS!

22:54.460 --> 22:55.896
Turn it off!

22:59.029 --> 23:00.944
Turn it off now!

23:03.425 --> 23:05.601
Get out of the car.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.126
Do you know what I did
to the last person

23:09.257 --> 23:10.780
who tried to run me over?

23:10.911 --> 23:12.173
Let them go?

23:12.347 --> 23:14.610
Take off your hat.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.614
How old are you?

23:18.788 --> 23:20.007
Eighteen.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.010
And a half.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.665
A little young
to be an arms dealer.

23:25.839 --> 23:27.580
Huh?

23:36.284 --> 23:37.677
You've got the wrong guy.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.722
I'm not
an international arms dealer.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.507
Oh, we figured that one out.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.334
PARKER:And yet you
still have a safe

23:43.509 --> 23:46.033
full of sensitive
military manuals in your trunk.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.469
Weird, huh?

23:47.643 --> 23:48.905
You know what's also weird?

23:49.079 --> 23:51.647
A dead Navy lieutenant.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.042
I got no idea who that is.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.609
That's the guy you robbed.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.088
And blew up.

23:58.262 --> 24:01.440
See, that's why
he's missing half a face.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.616
I didn't blow anybody up.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.487
So you just robbed him?

24:05.618 --> 24:08.316
No, I'm the one who was robbed.
Who puts books in a safe?

24:08.490 --> 24:09.970
I figured it was
jewelry or cash.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.320
So you expect us to believe
that you just randomly

24:12.494 --> 24:14.583
picked a
house to rob

24:14.757 --> 24:17.194
hours before a bomb exploded
in the living room?

24:17.325 --> 24:19.196
I didn't say it was random.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.763
He was supposed
to be out of town.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.025
And how do you know that?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.506
Lucky guess.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.725
Sailors get deployed

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
- all the time.
- Try again, Zack.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.859
Or maybe we just
charge you with murder.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.078
Okay.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.647
It was my brother.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.390
Noah?

24:39.565 --> 24:41.567
You guys picked him up
the other night?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.352
Hoodie boy?

24:44.526 --> 24:46.746
Your brother is Noah Richter?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.095
Half brother.

24:48.269 --> 24:49.792
Different dads.

24:49.966 --> 24:53.187
Wait till mom cop
finds out about this.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.885
His friends like to sneak
into empty houses to party.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.540
I figured if anyone
noticed anything missing,

24:58.671 --> 25:01.369
- they'd get the blame.
- Hmm. Classy.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.111
But the kids never partied
in Lieutenant Tang's house.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.113
No, but they were going to.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.593
And how do you know that?

25:08.768 --> 25:09.899
Because I saw the invite

25:10.030 --> 25:11.814
on that girl's BratChat thread.

25:11.988 --> 25:15.601
That girl wouldn't be
named Teagan, by any chance?

25:19.387 --> 25:23.304
She told McGee that she
never heard of Lieutenant Tang.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.352
Mc
This is Teagan's invite
for the party

25:28.483 --> 25:29.963
at Lieutenant Tang's house.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.617
She knew
exactly who he was.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.793
She lied to me.
Why?

25:33.923 --> 25:35.055
There's got to be some
connection between 'em

25:35.229 --> 25:36.752
that we're missing.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.362
And I think I know what it is.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.800
That was Navy Personnel Command.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.280
Tang's shore assignment
was in the Second Fleet

25:43.411 --> 25:45.195
- Operations Center.
- Right.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.546
Guess whose ship is currently
assigned to the Second Fleet.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.942
Chief Petty
Officer Melissa Fields.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.640
Teagan's mother.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.033
She's an EOD tech
aboard the USS <i>Wilmington.</i>

25:57.207 --> 25:59.166
Tang's responsibility
was managing

25:59.296 --> 26:00.950
the <i>Wilmington's</i>
deployments,

26:01.124 --> 26:02.778
and I don't think Teagan
would be a fan of his work.

26:04.824 --> 26:05.955
Our victim was about to deploy

26:06.086 --> 26:07.653
Teagan's mom to Latvia.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.872
Teagan would have to move again.

26:10.046 --> 26:12.309
But with Tang dead, maybe that
deployment doesn't go through.

26:12.483 --> 26:13.746
I think we found our motive.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.399
No. No, no. No way.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.010
People have killed for less.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.577
She's a kid.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.274
PARKER:Hey, I lived
with my sister

26:20.448 --> 26:22.189
for a week while my niece
was in middle school.

26:22.319 --> 26:24.887
The sky is the limit
when it comes to puberty.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.672
Okay, don't tell me that.
Please don't tell me that.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.980
Let me go to her house
and talk to her, okay?

26:31.154 --> 26:32.765
Let me see what she has to say
before we haul her in.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.941
Uh, Jimmy wants to talk to me.

26:35.115 --> 26:37.683
Good luck, McGee. You're
probably gonna need it.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.254
I was really hoping not
to see this guy again.

26:44.428 --> 26:45.560
This better be worth it.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.127
It is. I may have an answer

26:47.301 --> 26:48.563
as to what killed
our lieutenant.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.740
It wasn't the, uh,
you know, kaboom?

26:51.914 --> 26:53.350
Well, yeah, uh,
m-more specifically,

26:53.524 --> 26:55.918
it was the shrapnel
inside of the kaboom.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.138
U-Uh, but this was
no ordinary hardware store

26:58.312 --> 27:00.140
IED filled with nails.

27:00.314 --> 27:01.663
In fact, figuring out what
it was filled with has been

27:01.837 --> 27:03.491
quite the journey.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.536
Skip to the destination.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.364
According to Kasie,
the shrapnel inside

27:07.538 --> 27:10.237
is over 100 years old
and has been degraded

27:10.367 --> 27:11.891
by highly acidic soil.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.936
I'm stumped already.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.546
Yeah, so was Kasie.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.331
She recommended
we find a metallurgist.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.812
Now, after Agent Knight told us
about her trip to Hawai'i,

27:19.942 --> 27:21.683
I knew just who to call.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.206
Wait, what did Knight
say about me?

27:23.380 --> 27:24.860
May I present

27:25.034 --> 27:27.297
Ernie Malik from
the Pearl Harbor field office.

27:27.471 --> 27:28.516
Nice to meet you, Ernie.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.473
No, no, no, come on, come on.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.823
Wh-What, what did she say
about me?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.172
I don't recall any specifics.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.652
I think she said he was

27:33.826 --> 27:35.697
the smartest guy she's ever met.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.394
- She said that about me?
- I don't think she said that.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.266
Yes.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.747
Will-- So, will Jess
be joining us down here?

27:43.183 --> 27:44.619
Uh, afraid not. Just me.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.838
Alden Parker.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.622
Oh.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.103
Supervisory Special Agent
Alden Parker.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.365
Of course.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.497
Um, as, uh, Jimmy alluded to,

27:53.628 --> 27:56.109
I have extensive knowledge
of metallurgy.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.807
As well as world
military history, it turns out.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.940
So, the killer built
this bomb using pieces

28:01.114 --> 28:02.811
from an old artillery shell

28:02.985 --> 28:04.639
found in the Alsace region
of France.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.337
One of thousands
left over from WWI.

28:07.511 --> 28:10.297
Any idea how parts
from a World War I explosive

28:10.427 --> 28:12.081
ended up in our victim's skull?

28:12.212 --> 28:13.822
No idea.

28:13.996 --> 28:16.520
But if you call Jess down,
maybe we can brainstorm.

28:16.651 --> 28:17.870
Uh, thanks, Ernie. Bye.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.132
Wait.

28:19.306 --> 28:20.873
Poor guy.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.657
Seems kind of desperate.

28:22.831 --> 28:25.007
Uh, now back to that,
uh, antique bomb.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.444
Maybe it's not such a bad
idea to have Agent Knight

28:27.618 --> 28:30.012
come down here to brainstorm.

28:30.186 --> 28:33.015
Don't need her.
I think I just figured out

28:33.189 --> 28:36.584
how those old bomb parts
ended up in Tang's skull.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.760
- How?
- Ever wonder why an EOD

28:38.934 --> 28:41.676
bomb tech gets
assigned to Latvia?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.591
No. And why do you
look so worried

28:43.765 --> 28:45.593
all of a sudden?

28:45.767 --> 28:46.942
Mc<i>
I'm NCIS Special Agent McGee.</i>

28:47.116 --> 28:48.770
<i>I need to talk to your niece.</i>

28:48.901 --> 28:50.119
You sure you want
to talk to her?

28:50.250 --> 28:51.338
She's upstairs in her room.

28:51.512 --> 28:52.818
In a mood.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.297
Yeah, it's pretty important.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.821
Okay.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.388
I'm gonna send her a text,
because, uh,

28:58.562 --> 29:00.216
Teagan's incapable
of hearing my voice

29:00.390 --> 29:02.175
- while she has her cell.
- Ah.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.786
Does Teagan's mom know about

29:04.917 --> 29:07.223
her little breaking
and entering problem?

29:07.354 --> 29:09.791
Her team is on radio silence
until mission is complete.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.793
She's gonna blow a gasket
when she finds out.

29:11.967 --> 29:13.490
What, that her daughter
was arrested

29:13.664 --> 29:15.754
or that it was
during your watch?

29:15.928 --> 29:19.366
Oh, geez.
My sister's gonna kill me.

29:19.496 --> 29:20.933
Look, don't beat
yourself up, okay?

29:21.107 --> 29:23.065
I'm going through
the same thing myself.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.588
My kids are four years old.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.721
That's a great age.

29:26.895 --> 29:29.593
When Teagan was four,
we'd play pony for hours on end.

29:29.724 --> 29:31.465
Now she doesn't even
come out of her room.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.859
Well, except, apparently,
to break the law.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.165
Well, that's
a comforting thought.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.559
Yeah.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.213
Parker, yeah. What's up?

29:40.387 --> 29:41.867
You need to bring Teagan back
to NCIS now.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.782
Why? What's going on?

29:43.956 --> 29:45.392
It looks like she built
the bomb, McGee.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.437
Wait, bomb?
What are you talking about?

29:47.611 --> 29:50.223
Do you know why her mom
was being reassigned to Latvia?

29:50.397 --> 29:52.007
Because she specializes

29:52.181 --> 29:54.401
in pre-1950s ordnance disposal.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.925
The stuff left over
from our old wars.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.884
Yeah, I can see she really knows
her stuff here.

29:59.058 --> 30:00.450
Yeah, she's not the only one.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.888
The bomb was built
with old ordnance parts.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.107
Which Teagan would have known
about from her mom's work.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.022
Teagan?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.111
- What's going on? Hey. Hey.
- Teagan!

30:09.285 --> 30:10.373
Teagan?

30:10.547 --> 30:12.636
What's going on?

30:12.767 --> 30:14.073
- Can you open this?
- No way.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.509
You can't enter a
teenager's space uninvited.

30:15.683 --> 30:16.466
Teagan, we're coming in.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.947
What the hell is going on?!

30:19.121 --> 30:20.644
You got to be kidding me.
Where is she?!

30:29.218 --> 30:32.004
Agent Parker, are you telling me
my daughter is gone?

30:32.134 --> 30:35.442
NCIS has teams
looking for her as we speak.

30:35.572 --> 30:38.097
She's had it rough
the last few years.

30:38.271 --> 30:40.055
Moving, fitting in.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.493
Evidence doesn't look good.
Running looks worse.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.931
It doesn't make any sense.

30:46.105 --> 30:48.716
She's been so happy
since we came to Norfolk.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.370
I think that's the problem.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.328
Any idea where she'd go?

30:52.502 --> 30:55.549
Or maybe
who she'd go to?

30:55.723 --> 30:58.117
There was a boy.
Um, Noah, I think.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.206
I heard her mention him
a few times,

31:00.380 --> 31:03.035
but she doesn't open up to me
about her love life.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.602
Yeah, Noah is not, uh,
not Teagan's boyfriend.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.388
I mean, he wishes, but... He's too mid.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.302
No, she's with Jayden.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.130
Jayden's valid.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.827
There's no way she's still
with that Jayden kid.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.089
I know that much.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.395
What makes you say that?

31:15.569 --> 31:16.918
He was supposed to be her date

31:17.049 --> 31:18.702
to the Military Child
of the Year gala,

31:18.877 --> 31:20.748
but he blew her off last minute.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.358
That was the first time
they were gonna meet in person.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.186
She was inconsolable.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.232
Wait, did you say
that they never met in person?

31:26.406 --> 31:27.668
No.

31:29.104 --> 31:31.411
And you don't think
that was strange?

31:31.585 --> 31:36.503
Yes, but a lot of things about
kids today are strange to me.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.725
There's a reason Teagan
never met this kid in person.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.292
Because "Jayden"

31:43.423 --> 31:44.598
doesn't exist.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.600
He looks like he exists.

31:46.774 --> 31:48.515
That's actually a combination
of stock photos.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.082
Check this out.

31:56.436 --> 31:58.307
Teagan was catfished.

31:58.481 --> 32:01.093
Someone with a fake I.D.
lured her into a relationship.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.442
Which is terrifying.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.009
You got a real I.D.?

32:04.183 --> 32:05.488
Working on it.
He says he's a 15-year-old

32:05.662 --> 32:07.012
from Oceanside,

32:07.186 --> 32:08.404
but metadata
from his BratChat account

32:08.578 --> 32:11.407
suggests he's actually
around 40.

32:11.581 --> 32:12.974
Lives in Reston.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.324
Yeah, that's a lot of suspects.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.152
Any idea what he's after?

32:17.326 --> 32:18.806
Well, usually,
these romance scams

32:18.980 --> 32:20.808
are used to steal
someone's credit card.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.768
Except Teagan doesn't have one.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.510
Well, it has to have something
to do with Tang's murder.

32:29.208 --> 32:32.254
When did Teagan
and whoever this guy is

32:32.428 --> 32:33.734
start talking?

32:33.908 --> 32:35.779
Uh, around three months ago.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.651
That's right when
the break-ins started.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.001
And I doubt that
that was a coincidence.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.658
No luck on Teagan's BOLO yet.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.226
But we pulled her cell
records and recovered a bunch

32:47.356 --> 32:49.532
of deleted messages
between her and Jayden.

32:49.706 --> 32:51.273
He was the one that talked her
into hacking the base server

32:51.447 --> 32:53.493
so that people could
break into the houses.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.582
He spent a lot of time asking
about her mom's EOD experience.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.149
Let me guess.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.934
He asked for the master key
to get on base?

33:00.108 --> 33:01.631
Yeah. And she
gave it to him.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.416
Teagan did not kill Tang.

33:03.590 --> 33:04.634
The catfisher
set her up,

33:04.808 --> 33:06.027
used her to get on base.

33:06.201 --> 33:07.681
Then built a bomb using parts

33:07.855 --> 33:09.030
that we would trace back to her.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.815
All right, just-just
stay with me.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.948
So what is this guy's beef
with Tang?

33:14.079 --> 33:15.689
We got to find out who he is.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.125
Which means we have
to find Teagan.

33:18.648 --> 33:19.954
She just went online. McGee.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.174
Yeah. Tapping
into her message feed.

33:28.615 --> 33:29.529
Waiting for him where?

33:29.659 --> 33:31.183
You got a location?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.709
Shopping center in Reston.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.754
But Tang is dead.
Why-why would he risk

33:37.928 --> 33:39.234
meeting Teagan in person?

33:39.408 --> 33:40.540
To tie up loose ends.

33:40.670 --> 33:42.324
Let's move.

33:47.286 --> 33:48.852
It went straight
to voice mail again.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.724
Maybe she's screening
your calls.

33:50.898 --> 33:51.768
Or maybe we're too late.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.422
Think positive, McGee.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.337
We need to get Teagan
off-site quietly.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.773
If she makes a scene
and the killer sees,

33:56.947 --> 33:58.079
we lose our shot
at catching him.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.038
I have a feeling
she's not gonna go quietly.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.083
Hey, Knight, do you have eyes?

34:02.257 --> 34:03.954
I just tapped into the CCTV,

34:04.129 --> 34:05.521
but half of these
cameras are off-line.

34:05.695 --> 34:07.219
Can you get them back on line?

34:07.349 --> 34:10.874
Uh... this is really
McGee's territory.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.963
Sorry, he's our
Teagan whisperer.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.356
We need his boots
on the ground.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.228
Whoa, whoa. Hold up, hold up.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.664
Nine o'clock.

34:19.796 --> 34:20.710
Yeah, I see her.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.277
All right, get her in the van.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.671
We'll wait in the wings
in case the killer shows.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.164
You waiting for someone?

34:39.338 --> 34:41.122
Not that it's any
of your business,

34:41.296 --> 34:43.298
but I'm waiting
for my boyfriend.

34:46.258 --> 34:49.130
Let me guess,
it was Jayden's idea

34:49.304 --> 34:51.306
for you to sneak
out the window?

34:53.482 --> 34:55.571
Just like it was Jayden's idea
to break into those houses?

34:55.745 --> 34:58.618
You don't know
anything about him, okay?

35:03.710 --> 35:06.016
Actually, you got that
backwards, Teagan.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.670
What's that supposed to mean?

35:09.933 --> 35:12.197
We called Camp Pendleton.

35:12.371 --> 35:14.721
There's no record
of Jayden or his family.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.898
Kasie discovered the picture
on BratChat was fake.

35:19.987 --> 35:23.208
You know, Jayden told
me not to trust you.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.431
That's because
he's not real, Teagan.

35:29.605 --> 35:33.218
He's a bad man and he's trying
to set you up for murder.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.611
Stop trying to pull
some cop trick on me.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.178
It's not gonna work.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.224
Why would I lie to you, Teagan?

35:39.398 --> 35:42.879
Because if you're not lying,
then you're saying

35:43.053 --> 35:46.883
the one person
who ever got me isn't real.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.973
I get you.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.889
Heard that before.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.938
I'm serious, Teagan.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.723
I get you, in every way. You...

36:00.897 --> 36:02.247
You are an amazing kid.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.859
You are funny,
you are so smart.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.427
Killer taste in music.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.125
A little too sarcastic
for your own good, but...

36:11.299 --> 36:13.345
I don't know,
it kind of suits you.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.348
One other thing.

36:16.522 --> 36:21.222
You told me to listen
to what my daughter wants.

36:21.396 --> 36:23.616
You know,
just because she's four,

36:23.790 --> 36:26.793
doesn't mean that what
she wants isn't important.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.973
I need you to listen
to me now, okay?

36:35.193 --> 36:39.022
What you want
isn't real.

36:40.633 --> 36:43.418
So right now I need you
to come with me, okay?

36:54.516 --> 36:55.865
Nicely done, McGee.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.696
We're gonna catch
this guy in a van?

37:00.827 --> 37:02.742
Yep, we tapped into
the mall's surveillance system.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.439
We're going off
Kasie's suspect profile.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.920
- There's only one problem.
- What?

37:07.094 --> 37:09.357
We don't even know
what he looks like.

37:09.531 --> 37:11.707
He knows what I look like.
You could use me as bait.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.275
- So not happening.
- Absolutely not, no.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.321
We can't let him get away.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.410
There is no "we"
in this situation.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.281
I'm open to the kid's ideas.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.630
Hack his phone.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.066
We tried that. It's not on.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.285
I can turn it on.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.547
If you let me.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.462
Have at it.

37:33.555 --> 37:36.906
I can get access to his phone
via the BratChat code.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.692
Is this like the tenth law
you've broken in two days?

37:39.866 --> 37:41.259
Arrest me later.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.527
You used his profile to install

37:48.701 --> 37:51.747
a backdoor
on his phone months ago?

37:51.878 --> 37:52.574
TEAGAN:I installed a backdoor
on anyone's phone

37:52.748 --> 37:53.706
I gave a key to,

37:53.880 --> 37:55.447
in case I needed to revoke it.

37:56.796 --> 37:58.014
Okay, I'm in.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.668
I don't have access to his GPS,

37:59.799 --> 38:02.105
but I can turn the volume
on his ringer all the way up.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.237
All right,
let's give him a call.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.717
People don't call anymore,

38:04.891 --> 38:06.066
Agent McGee, they text.

38:09.548 --> 38:10.810
You hear that?

38:11.941 --> 38:14.161
It's coming from over there.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.294
Keep going, Teagan.
We're getting close.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.344
Torres. Your 12.

38:27.261 --> 38:28.567
NCIS! Don't move.

38:28.741 --> 38:29.437
Get out of the way!
Out of the way!

38:31.134 --> 38:32.048
Get on the ground now.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.573
I said get down.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.185
Torres, cuff him.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.884
Nice work, Teagan.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.365
I can't believe I was talking
to a homeless Kenny G.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.413
Well done.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.548
His real name is Jason Samuels.

38:53.722 --> 38:55.985
He did seven years
on a hit-and-run.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.944
McGEE:It turns out it was
Lieutenant Tang's

38:58.074 --> 39:00.555
eyewitness testimony
that sent him to prison.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.427
Yeah, his cellmate said
that he was obsessed

39:02.601 --> 39:04.211
with getting revenge.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.865
And he tried framing
Teagan with bomb parts

39:06.039 --> 39:07.649
that he bought on the dark web.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.173
Pretty mid.
Very mid.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.047
I appreciate the effort,
but you guys

39:14.221 --> 39:16.179
should stick
with old people talk.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.312
I think she's talking
about you.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.447
I can't believe
I fell for it.

39:22.621 --> 39:24.231
I should've known.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.363
Don't beat yourself up.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.626
This guy was
plotting his revenge

39:27.756 --> 39:30.063
while you were still
learning how to read.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.194
I was reading at three.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.805
Either way,

39:32.979 --> 39:34.807
we would not have caught
Samuels without you.

39:34.981 --> 39:36.983
You're welcome.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.464
Bold. I like this girl.

39:41.204 --> 39:43.642
You know, Teagan, if my daughter
is anything like you

39:43.772 --> 39:45.905
when she grows up,
I'm gonna be very proud.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.689
You'll be proud
of her anyway.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.604
She's lucky
to have you as a dad.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.738
Why do you say that?

39:55.088 --> 39:56.611
You're a good listener.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.443
FIELDS:Teagan.
Mom?

40:02.617 --> 40:04.358
- Mom!
- Honey.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.013
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

40:09.145 --> 40:10.059
Thank God. I thought you
were gonna kill me.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.713
Oh, I am.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.063
But right now I just
want to hug you.

40:14.237 --> 40:15.848
That's your future, McGee.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.980
You know, minus the, uh,
brushes with the law, I hope.

40:18.154 --> 40:18.981
Are you okay?

40:19.155 --> 40:20.635
I missed you.

40:20.809 --> 40:23.116
Oh, you're in for it, Tim.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.292
Yeah, well, then I guess
I'll enjoy the, uh,

40:25.466 --> 40:27.642
princess dress phase
while it lasts.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.213
Captioning sponsored by CBS
