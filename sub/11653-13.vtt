AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.672 --> 00:09.135
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.594 --> 00:12.680
unleashed an unspeakable evil,

00:13.181 --> 00:16.184
but, a foolish samurai warrior

00:16.267 --> 00:18.478
wielding a magic sword

00:18.770 --> 00:21.356
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.611
Before the final blow was struck,

00:26.694 --> 00:29.280
I tore open a portal in time,

00:29.531 --> 00:31.282
and flung him into the future,

00:31.449 --> 00:33.785
where my evil is law.

00:34.327 --> 00:38.289
Now, the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.540 --> 00:42.835
and undo the future that is Aku.

03:08.648 --> 03:11.693
Every miserable creature trembled

03:11.776 --> 03:14.904

03:15.655 --> 03:20.660
The pitiful people shrank
before my awesome power,

03:31.129 --> 03:34.924

of this plague of hope.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.224
I will unleash such evil

03:43.558 --> 03:50.148
that even the most innocent soul
will be consumed by terror.

03:53.443 --> 03:55.403
We're not afraid of you anymore, Aku,

04:16.466 --> 04:19.469
The seed of rebellion
has been planted in them

04:28.644 --> 04:32.857
Well, if they respond to stories,

04:33.441 --> 04:38.029
I have a tale or two that will turn Aku

(SHIVERING)

06:06.951 --> 06:10.329
A tale must be told...

06:11.122 --> 06:15.459
A tale of epic proportions.

06:19.213 --> 06:22.216
I will take you to a universe far away,

06:22.550 --> 06:25.136
to a world of hunger,

06:25.720 --> 06:31.809
for the only one who ate
was a corrupt and evil beast,

06:32.310 --> 06:34.812
a devourer of worlds,

06:34.896 --> 06:39.650
who set his sight
on our defenseless sphere.

06:40.359 --> 06:43.154
But, a beloved and courageous hero

06:43.237 --> 06:48.200
arose to oppose the terrorizing beast.

06:49.118 --> 06:53.372
Mounted on his sled
with eight tiny reindeer,

06:53.623 --> 06:57.752
he flew into battle
against the cosmic scourge.

07:11.682 --> 07:18.564
Then, the great warrior focused
all his power into his spear of truth,

07:19.065 --> 07:22.693
and he hurled it with all his might.

07:25.821 --> 07:29.659
The spear struck the beast,

07:30.284 --> 07:33.120
transforming him into...

07:33.996 --> 07:36.958
beef jerky.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.005
The great warrior was victorious,

07:43.589 --> 07:49.345
and the people feasted
on the spoils of his conquest

07:49.637 --> 07:53.265
and never went hungry again.

07:54.100 --> 07:58.813
"Who shall we thank
for this heroic feat?", the people asked.

07:59.480 --> 08:04.110
The warrior removed his helmet
to reveal himself.

08:05.319 --> 08:11.200
It was none other than I, Aku.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.830
And so, the people bowed down

08:15.913 --> 08:19.041
and made the great warrior their king.

08:19.625 --> 08:24.755
That is the story of how I came to be.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.142
Hmm...

08:37.018 --> 08:42.314
Perhaps my story is too complex
for these young minds.

08:42.815 --> 08:47.778
A story of the purest
simplicity must be told.

08:48.571 --> 08:52.158
Yes, fairy tales are simple,

08:52.491 --> 08:55.786
but the heroes within are legendary.

who was loved by all."

Hmm...

09:11.302 --> 09:13.512
Yes, I am familiar with this one.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.393
there was a little girl

with an adorable red cape and...

09:23.606 --> 09:28.319
great flaming eyebrows

09:29.653 --> 09:31.781
who was beloved by all,

09:32.281 --> 09:39.080
and so, the people affectionately
named her Little Red Hood.

09:39.747 --> 09:43.209
One day, Little Red Hood was on her way

09:43.292 --> 09:45.795
to her grandmother's house.

09:48.005 --> 09:52.134
My poor grandmama is of delicate health,

09:52.384 --> 09:54.887
so, I am delivering to her

09:54.970 --> 09:59.558
a picnic basket of confectionery treats.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.606
picnic basket filled with
delicious confectionery treats?

10:06.440 --> 10:09.944
AKU: And so, the mean wolf took a shortcut

10:10.277 --> 10:15.866
and arrived at Grandmother's house
before Little Red Hood.

10:56.323 --> 11:01.162

11:01.495 --> 11:04.415
Yeah, yeah. Big eyes, big teeth,
and a big appetite.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.084
AKU: The wolf attacked Little Red Hood,

11:07.418 --> 11:11.422
not knowing that Little Red Hood
had laser eye beams,

11:13.883 --> 11:15.467
great combat skills,

11:16.594 --> 11:18.220
and a powerful uppercut

11:18.304 --> 11:21.473
that freed Little Red's grandmother

11:21.557 --> 11:24.852
from the evil bowels of the wolf.

Mmm! Confectionery treats.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.818
there were three bears who lived together

12:55.901 --> 12:57.695
in a house of wood.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.826
One was a little wee bear,

13:04.285 --> 13:07.454
one was a middle-sized bear,

13:07.663 --> 13:13.085
and the other was a great huge bear.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.133
I made us some porridge, comrades,

13:19.258 --> 13:21.468
but, alas, it is too hot.

13:22.303 --> 13:23.304
That's okay, brother.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.888
We can go for a walk in the woods

began to eat.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.486
It did not matter to him

14:20.569 --> 14:25.491
if the porridge was too hot,
too cold, or just right.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.203

16:17.227 --> 16:18.854
No, but...

Perhaps, I exaggerated a little.

But this next story is true

17:33.512 --> 17:37.599
I will continue with yet another tale.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.647
<i>The story of poor little Cinderella</i>

17:43.814 --> 17:46.483
<i>and her evil stepmother Jacqueline</i>

17:46.692 --> 17:51.530
<i>and her two wicked stepsisters
Jackie and Jacqella.</i>

17:52.447 --> 17:53.448
Scrub that floor.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.075
- Wash those dishes.
- Make me dinner.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.995
- BOY: But Jack is a man.
- AKU: Very well!

17:58.495 --> 18:00.664
AKU: There once was a house made of candy,

18:00.998 --> 18:04.334
but a giant samurai came and smashed it.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.046
Fo fee fi fo fum. Guess my name.

18:09.006 --> 18:12.092
BOY: But, those are
three different stories.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.844
AKU: With great endings.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.679
And so, the samurai prince

18:15.846 --> 18:19.474
finally found the magic frog
and kissed him,

18:19.725 --> 18:23.770
enraging the frog,
who then ate the samurai prince.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.565
CHILD: But wasn't Jack just a giant?

18:26.982 --> 18:29.818
AKU: Yes, and he fell off the beanstalk.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.738
- GIRL: But he wasn't on a beanstalk.
- AKU: You are correct.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.407
AKU: He was searching for his lost sheep,

18:35.490 --> 18:37.117
who stampeded over him.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.453
BOY: That's not how the story goes.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.579
AKU: Yes, it does!

18:40.954 --> 18:43.665
After barely surviving the sheep stampede,

18:43.790 --> 18:47.669
a cat in giant boots came along
and kicked the samurai.

18:47.878 --> 18:48.879
PHIL: What?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.339
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.090
(NEIGHS)

18:56.303 --> 18:57.679
(SQUEAKING)

19:17.741 --> 19:18.992
GIRL: What's happening?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.160
Enough.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.995
Here is the truest tale of all.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.248
There was an almighty, all-powerful wizard

19:25.457 --> 19:28.168
and there was a pathetic little samurai,

19:28.460 --> 19:31.129
and the wizard destroyed him.

19:31.797 --> 19:33.048
(EXPLOSIONS)

19:33.715 --> 19:34.716
The end.

19:40.097 --> 19:42.057
No, that's not how it would happen.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.183
Yeah.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.769
First, it would be a misty night.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.605
BOY 1: And, Jack would be
climbing a huge castle.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.274
BOY 2: But not before he defeated

19:51.358 --> 19:53.735
its eight foot, six-armed mutant guard.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.323
(GROWLING)

20:06.915 --> 20:07.916
BOY 3: Yeah.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.460
Then he will be climbing
all battle damaged.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.920
GIRL: With his hair all messed up.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.588
BOY 43 With his sword in his teeth.

20:13.839 --> 20:14.840
(GROWLING)

20:16.091 --> 20:17.092
BOY 2: Yeah.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.428
And as Jack reaches the top of the castle,

20:19.553 --> 20:22.472
Aku would creepily creep out
from the shadows.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.142
BOY 1: But Jack can smell
his terrible stench.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.269
- BOY 3: And then they fight.
- BOY 2: Not yet.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.396
BOY 2: First, they would
stare each other down.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.114
- BOY 3: And then, they fight.
- BOY 2: No, not yet.

20:39.614 --> 20:40.782
BOY 1: Jack would first say,

20:40.866 --> 20:43.702
"You have plagued the land
with your evil long enough.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.370
Prepare to meet your doom."

20:45.829 --> 20:46.913
BOY 3: And then they fight.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.290
BOY 2: No, not yet.

20:48.623 --> 20:49.833
GIRL: Because Aku would answer,

20:50.083 --> 20:52.419
"You are a truly powerful samurai,

20:52.502 --> 20:55.130
but no match for my evil wizardry."

20:58.800 --> 20:59.801
BOY 3: Now?

20:59.885 --> 21:00.886
GIRL: Now.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.679
BOY 3: And then, they fight!

21:02.804 --> 21:05.682
GIRL: Aku quickly turns into a huge, uh...

21:05.849 --> 21:06.892
BOY 3: ...dragon-like creature.

21:07.517 --> 21:10.103
GIRL: But he's no match
for Jack's samurai skills.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.610
And with one mighty blow...

21:18.403 --> 21:19.404
(CLANGS)

21:22.783 --> 21:24.409
...Jack destroys Aku.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.998
BOY 2: Then he would
sheath his sword all cool-style

21:30.081 --> 21:31.082
and say,

21:31.166 --> 21:32.667
BOY 1: "My quest has ended.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.212
"I will now travel back to my own time

21:35.295 --> 21:38.173
and undo the evil that Aku has done."

21:39.007 --> 21:40.217
CHILDREN; The end.
