Welcome to

Yeah, sadly,
I can't recognize your authority

Yuck, right?

26:55.380 --> 26:57.088
- Totally yuck.
- Yeah.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.880
- Okay, well, here's an idea.
Try and keep up.

26:58.922 --> 27:00.547
Why don't we just park
in our own driveways?

27:00.588 --> 27:02.171
That'd be so great.
Problem solved.

27:02.213 --> 27:04.714
- That way, I can void the
individual parking infractions
