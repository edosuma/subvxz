( music playing )

02:51.183 --> 02:52.650
( crickets chirping )

02:52.684 --> 02:55.019
( owl hooting )

03:05.330 --> 03:09.233
( engine humming )

03:12.171 --> 03:14.105
Daughter: We cross over yet?

03:17.276 --> 03:19.243
Little ways back.

03:21.413 --> 03:26.984
How much longer?

03:33.659 --> 03:36.127
How Oscar keeping these days?

03:37.162 --> 03:40.965
Well, some and some.

03:40.999 --> 03:43.401
Man: Ain't nobody
getting younger.

03:43.435 --> 03:45.336
Driver: Natural fact.

03:45.370 --> 03:47.605
How you come to know him?

03:47.639 --> 03:49.040
He ain't say?

03:49.074 --> 03:52.443
Say come pick you up
outside Wilmington.

03:52.477 --> 03:54.445
Get you some clean clothes.

03:54.479 --> 03:57.448
That's what we done.

04:04.656 --> 04:07.925
- How you see the road?
- Don't need to see it.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.571
( Brakes squeal )

04:20.605 --> 04:22.373

04:22.407 --> 04:24.442

( dog barking )

04:33.418 --> 04:35.319
( exhales )

04:36.388 --> 04:38.322
They're just being careful.

04:42.427 --> 04:44.462
You worked for Mr. Boneau?

04:48.166 --> 04:51.569
Got myself in a knockdown

04:51.603 --> 04:53.604
with some corner boys.

04:55.907 --> 04:57.808
Way I was then...

04:59.544 --> 05:02.513
I looked for a
fight any old how.

05:03.515 --> 05:06.217
Never even felt that razor.

05:07.486 --> 05:09.954
Looked down...

05:09.988 --> 05:12.389
hand full of blood,

05:12.424 --> 05:16.327
like... like I put
'em in a bucket.

05:18.129 --> 05:20.231
Didn't even know it was mine.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.668
Just kept ragin'.

05:25.971 --> 05:29.073
- What happened?
- A man come out.

05:30.442 --> 05:34.178
I ain't never seen no
one like him before.

05:34.212 --> 05:37.715
Folk just... Just
move out his way.

05:38.683 --> 05:40.885
Them boys fly off.

05:43.088 --> 05:45.789
I said, "Sir, thank you kindly."

05:46.691 --> 05:48.792
Hat back on.

05:48.827 --> 05:52.396
Ain't had the legs
to walk three feet.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.399
Take me away 'fore
the police come.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.368
Put me to work.

05:58.470 --> 06:01.005
Taught me everything I know.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.743
That Oscar.

06:09.681 --> 06:11.815
Haven of Grace.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.183
Huh?

06:14.185 --> 06:15.953
That's what it means.

06:25.263 --> 06:26.897
You can come on out.

06:28.867 --> 06:30.434
Come on.

06:40.645 --> 06:42.446
You Mr. White.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.015
- Who are you now?
- Ain't you Mr. White?

06:45.083 --> 06:47.885
- Who else I gonna be?
- I'm Winston.

06:47.919 --> 06:49.553
Everybody call me Scrapper.

06:49.587 --> 06:51.155
( Chuckles ) I don't know why.

06:51.189 --> 06:54.158
My uncle told me all about you.

06:55.827 --> 06:59.196
Means: There's a skunk
in your cellar.

06:59.230 --> 07:00.831
Who is this?

07:00.865 --> 07:03.200
Wouldn't you like
to know his name?

07:04.402 --> 07:06.537
Means. Is that you?

07:06.604 --> 07:07.871
$50,000.

07:07.906 --> 07:09.586
- ( Rummaging )
- Man: You, check upstairs.

07:09.610 --> 07:10.941
What are you talking about?

07:10.975 --> 07:12.943
A fair price, considering

07:12.977 --> 07:16.380
- the incendiary nature of the revelation.
- Man ♪2: Means!

07:16.414 --> 07:19.383
You wake me up at...
What time is it?

07:19.417 --> 07:22.252
- 75,000.
- ( footsteps, shouting )

07:22.320 --> 07:23.387
You just said 50.

07:23.421 --> 07:25.422
- ( Shouting continues )
- Did I?

07:25.456 --> 07:26.890
Are you drunk, Means?

07:26.925 --> 07:28.725
Sober as a judge.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.327
What are you trying to sell?

07:30.361 --> 07:31.929
( Chuckles ) Information,

07:31.963 --> 07:33.463
regarding a certain individual

07:33.498 --> 07:36.033
I am uniquely
qualified to provide.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.534
Man ♪3: Open up!

07:37.569 --> 07:39.036
Tell me a name, Means.

07:39.070 --> 07:40.804
- ( Banging )
- $200,000.

07:40.838 --> 07:43.206
- I'm hanging up.
- Half a million dollars!

07:44.275 --> 07:46.376
( Crashing, clamor )

07:46.411 --> 07:49.579
Means: I am unarmed
and defenseless.

07:53.785 --> 07:56.787
Who has sent you
grim-visaged thuggees?

07:56.821 --> 07:58.989
Secretary Mellon?

07:59.023 --> 08:03.527
The Attorney General? That
unweaned whelp Hoover?

08:04.896 --> 08:07.030
United States Capitol Police.

08:08.223 --> 08:09.543
What is the alleged
transgression?

08:09.567 --> 08:11.134
Perjury before a
Senate committee

08:11.169 --> 08:12.803
on March 14th of this year.

08:12.837 --> 08:14.571
To what precise aspect
of my testimony

08:14.605 --> 08:16.973
is exception being taken?

08:18.276 --> 08:21.411
- All of it.
- ( objects breaking )

08:21.479 --> 08:23.480
( bell buoys ringing )

08:26.417 --> 08:29.119
Everything okay, boss?

08:29.153 --> 08:31.088
Smell any skunks out there?

08:32.457 --> 08:34.758
I don't think they walk on sand.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.100
( Chickens clucking )

08:55.112 --> 08:57.113
What river?

08:57.148 --> 08:59.282
Susquehanna.

08:59.317 --> 09:01.718
Flow into the Chesapeake.

09:01.752 --> 09:04.354
Then where?

09:04.388 --> 09:06.890
Out the ocean.

09:06.924 --> 09:08.825
'Cross the world.

09:10.228 --> 09:12.028
Anywhere it want.

09:14.131 --> 09:16.766
Ain't that water lucky?

09:18.236 --> 09:20.337
( Gate squeaks )

09:23.574 --> 09:26.076
( rooster crows )

09:27.445 --> 09:29.212
Chair's right there.

09:33.684 --> 09:35.218
Where you at?

09:35.286 --> 09:37.387
Right here.

09:38.789 --> 09:41.458
Well, come closer.
I wanna see you.

09:47.298 --> 09:49.966
( Rooster crows )

09:57.174 --> 09:58.808
( laughs )

09:58.843 --> 10:00.810
I know what you're thinking.

10:00.845 --> 10:03.079
- What?
- "The fuck happened to him?"

10:03.114 --> 10:05.448
- ( both laughing )
- Got old.

10:05.483 --> 10:07.283
Ah, as old as I'm
gonna get, boy.

10:07.351 --> 10:10.920
- ( Chalky laughs ) Don't know about that.
- Yeah.

10:10.955 --> 10:13.289
When was the last time
you was here, Albert?

10:15.659 --> 10:17.093
My littlest was born.

10:17.128 --> 10:19.396
Oh, seven years?

10:19.463 --> 10:20.997
Nine.

10:21.031 --> 10:22.732
She the one getting married?

10:22.767 --> 10:24.734
You don't marry off
no nine-year-old.

10:24.769 --> 10:28.638
I seen it, though, back on Queen
Street over in Charleston.

10:28.672 --> 10:30.373
They fought the war over that.

10:30.407 --> 10:32.475
That's not why they
fought the war.

10:32.510 --> 10:34.644
( Scoffs ) You're too
smart to be that dumb.

10:34.712 --> 10:36.913
( Both chuckle )

10:36.981 --> 10:38.815
( sniffs )

10:42.686 --> 10:44.254
What's your name?

10:46.190 --> 10:48.091
Daughter.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.893
That's your name?

10:51.996 --> 10:53.463
Yes, sir.

10:53.497 --> 10:54.864
( Chuckles )

10:54.899 --> 10:56.299
Had me a bluetick coon once

10:56.367 --> 10:59.002
and didn't call him Hound.

11:00.204 --> 11:03.139
- What you look like?
- Sir?

11:03.173 --> 11:06.509
I can't see my hand
in front of my face.

11:06.544 --> 11:08.077
You got to tell me.

11:09.179 --> 11:12.148
- I...
- She a beauty, Oscar.

11:12.182 --> 11:13.950
Oscar: I don't doubt it.

11:14.885 --> 11:16.953
I do not doubt it.

11:19.990 --> 11:21.658
Hey, Weems? You there?

11:21.692 --> 11:24.861
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Ayleese show up yet?

11:24.895 --> 11:26.462
Her day off.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.969
Hey, uh, Bluetick, you cook?

11:33.003 --> 11:35.138
If I have to.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.874
Well, you best get to it.

11:37.908 --> 11:39.375
The rest of y'all go with her.

11:39.410 --> 11:40.943
You want me to stay, Uncle?

11:40.978 --> 11:43.446
Ah, if I want that, I say that.

11:44.682 --> 11:46.149
I'll show you where
everything is.

11:48.252 --> 11:51.220
- Hope there's an apron.
- Yes, ma'am, we got that.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.933
What you come here for, Albert?

12:05.002 --> 12:06.536
What you told me.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.371
Well, I told you a lot.

12:08.405 --> 12:10.339
Don't know what you heard.

12:12.009 --> 12:14.510
Never trust no buckras,
no matter what.

12:14.545 --> 12:18.014
Never trust no browns neither.

12:21.251 --> 12:23.753
You was right on both counts.

12:28.859 --> 12:31.394
You need to be realistic.

12:31.428 --> 12:33.763
There isn't a house like
it within 50 miles.

12:33.797 --> 12:35.765
That's not to its advantage.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.401
And you've needed a buyer
who's not inclined

12:38.435 --> 12:40.670
to ask too many questions.

12:40.704 --> 12:42.038
That's what we have here.

12:42.072 --> 12:45.141
$37,000 is a substantial sum.

12:45.209 --> 12:47.076
- For someone like me.
- For anyone.

12:47.110 --> 12:49.045
The Commodore wouldn't think so.

12:49.079 --> 12:53.783
Louis would make the
best of a bad situation.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.352
I'll have to raise
a child on it.

12:56.386 --> 12:58.487
Support myself for
the rest of my life.

12:58.522 --> 13:01.090
- Isn't there a new companion?
- I'm sorry?

13:01.124 --> 13:03.226
What are his intentions?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.860
That's really not your concern.

13:04.895 --> 13:07.964
This isn't about love,
it's about finances.

13:08.031 --> 13:09.932
I've never known you to
be foolish about those.

13:09.967 --> 13:12.935
- Well, maybe I've changed.
- That rarely occurs.

13:12.970 --> 13:15.605
If that's how you feel,
Leander, I pity you.

13:15.672 --> 13:17.073
I urge you to take the offer.

13:17.107 --> 13:20.710
Mr. Ferry, what if I lose?

13:20.744 --> 13:22.378
Overall, our case
is still very...

13:22.412 --> 13:24.013
But what happens?

13:24.047 --> 13:25.848
Appeal, of course.

13:25.882 --> 13:28.517
New concerns regarding the
suitability of the Sagorskys,

13:28.552 --> 13:30.453
positive change in circumstance.

13:30.487 --> 13:32.455
The sale of the house,
just for example.

13:32.489 --> 13:34.890
With enough resources, we
can tie it up for years.

13:34.925 --> 13:37.626
- And where is Tommy during all that?
- With you.

13:37.661 --> 13:40.796
With them, a benevolent
institution.

13:40.831 --> 13:42.365
Those are all possibilities.

13:42.399 --> 13:44.200
The Trenton Home for
Friendless Children?

13:44.234 --> 13:46.836
I couldn't say what
particular institution...

13:46.870 --> 13:48.270
Do you know what
it's like there?

13:48.305 --> 13:50.873
- There's no point...
- Because I do.

13:51.908 --> 13:53.709
I do.

13:53.744 --> 13:56.345
This conversation is
about the future.

13:56.380 --> 13:59.048
Childhood doesn't last.

13:59.116 --> 14:00.583
Nothing lasts.

14:00.617 --> 14:02.618
He won't even remember.

14:04.054 --> 14:05.354
Years?

14:05.389 --> 14:07.123
The way you win
things like this:

14:07.157 --> 14:09.558
time, money, and persistence.

14:09.593 --> 14:13.162
- Grab on and just don't ever let go.
- ( children's voices )

14:13.196 --> 14:15.397
Knowing the opposition's
limited ability...

14:15.432 --> 14:17.192
- ( clock ticking )
- to incur ongoing costs,

14:17.216 --> 14:21.070
the longer we can draw it out...
( voice fades )

14:21.138 --> 14:25.141
Joe Masseria, Meyer
Lansky, Luciano...

14:26.176 --> 14:28.978
Lucky, Charlie...

14:29.012 --> 14:30.679
And the one in Florida.

14:30.714 --> 14:32.214
Vincenzo Petrucelli.

14:32.249 --> 14:34.483
Nothing to say. I never met him.

14:34.518 --> 14:35.618
Your brother?

14:38.021 --> 14:39.488
Put the whole thing in place,

14:39.523 --> 14:41.857
didn't leave him a choice.

14:41.892 --> 14:44.960
This dinge they
got, the doctor...

14:47.030 --> 14:48.430
they're running it through him.

14:48.465 --> 14:50.533
Nucky takes orders
from a colored.

14:50.567 --> 14:53.736
That's the story you're telling?

14:53.770 --> 14:55.504
The money, he...

14:56.840 --> 14:59.041
He can't walk away from that.

15:00.944 --> 15:03.579
- Chicago?
- Not part of this.

15:03.613 --> 15:05.281
10,000 a month to
Torrio and Capone?

15:05.315 --> 15:06.815
Just paying off a debt.

15:08.585 --> 15:09.785
All right.

15:09.819 --> 15:12.554
New York, Atlantic City, Tampa.

15:12.589 --> 15:14.490
That'll have to be enough.

15:15.959 --> 15:17.559
Get to work.

15:17.594 --> 15:20.496
- He won't bite.
- I need them all in a room, Eli,

15:20.563 --> 15:23.465
making plans to operate in
collusion across state lines.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.134
That's what I came for.

15:27.370 --> 15:28.971
You don't know how Nucky thinks.

15:29.005 --> 15:31.407
- You said he likes the money.
- That won't stop him.

15:31.441 --> 15:34.777
He talks about peace.

15:34.811 --> 15:37.846
He doesn't mean it.
He never has.

15:37.881 --> 15:39.615
You admire that?

15:40.684 --> 15:42.718
You grow up in our house?

15:43.987 --> 15:47.089
Newspapers for blankets,

15:47.123 --> 15:50.025
stolen potatoes for supper.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.027
Or nothing.

15:52.062 --> 15:54.063
That night or the next.

15:55.031 --> 15:56.765
You don't forget.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.834
You're not starving now.

16:01.271 --> 16:04.373
- He's my brother.
- He's not the father of your son.

16:07.177 --> 16:09.044
Kept him out of jail, didn't he?

16:09.078 --> 16:10.546
I wouldn't bet on that.

16:10.580 --> 16:12.781
Clayton Davies'
trial's coming up.

16:12.816 --> 16:16.018
What happens if his attorney
finds out about the evidence

16:16.052 --> 16:17.986
somebody was paid to suppress?

16:18.021 --> 16:21.323
Make the meeting
happen, or don't...

16:21.357 --> 16:23.625
The consequences are
for you to live with.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.627
But just bear this in mind...

16:25.662 --> 16:27.963
Whatever your excuse,

16:27.997 --> 16:30.098
you and I are down
this road together.

16:30.133 --> 16:33.535
Explain that to a man
who never forgets.

16:44.647 --> 16:47.149
You smell of whiskey.

16:47.183 --> 16:49.651
- What's it to you?
- Lay off it.

16:49.686 --> 16:51.687
You're no good to me like that.

16:57.293 --> 17:00.295
- ( Door opens )
- ( bell rings )

17:00.330 --> 17:04.299
( bell tolling )

17:04.334 --> 17:07.469
( distant children playing )

17:09.539 --> 17:11.606
( bells chiming )

17:28.658 --> 17:31.526
( crunching )

17:37.500 --> 17:39.267
Crunchy toast?

17:39.302 --> 17:40.836
It's raspberry jam.

17:40.870 --> 17:42.471
That does sound good.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.775
You know me, don't you?

17:46.809 --> 17:48.710
You're Mima.

17:48.745 --> 17:50.612
But who am I?

17:52.081 --> 17:53.515
Am I your mother?

17:53.583 --> 17:55.317
No.

17:55.351 --> 17:56.918
Where is she?

17:56.953 --> 17:58.620
She's gone.

18:00.323 --> 18:02.390
And your father?

18:02.425 --> 18:03.959
Where is he?

18:03.993 --> 18:06.228
I don't know.

18:06.262 --> 18:08.163
I don't either.

18:09.499 --> 18:11.299
Isn't it terrible?

18:15.538 --> 18:18.773
Would you come to me? Please?

18:32.321 --> 18:34.189
Richard: Don't touch him.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.335
- You live here.
- You don't.

18:48.604 --> 18:50.839
You wouldn't.

18:50.873 --> 18:52.507
Not in front of him.

18:52.541 --> 18:54.943
You just need to leave.

19:02.718 --> 19:06.554
Is this how you
planned it with her?

19:06.656 --> 19:08.757
To take everything
away that matters?

19:08.824 --> 19:10.692
I didn't plan anything.

19:10.726 --> 19:12.594
But it happened anyway.

19:22.071 --> 19:24.072
They're Jimmy's.

19:25.107 --> 19:27.342
Shouldn't he have something

19:27.376 --> 19:30.145
to remember?

19:30.179 --> 19:32.080
Wouldn't that be right?

19:49.098 --> 19:51.199
Keep these safe.

19:58.474 --> 20:00.575
There's a ring on your finger.

20:00.609 --> 20:02.343
Yes.

20:06.448 --> 20:08.349
And you'll both...

20:09.318 --> 20:11.152
take good care of him.

20:21.764 --> 20:24.933
( Distant children playing )

20:47.289 --> 20:50.591
( sighs ) Okay, then.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.928
Are those men coming
to dinner too?

20:53.963 --> 20:56.597
They keep an eye on
things for Uncle Nucky.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.034
Lovely day for the beach.

21:05.741 --> 21:08.910
( Chatter )

21:13.916 --> 21:16.451
What's wrong?

21:16.485 --> 21:19.020
Haul all the way out here.

21:19.054 --> 21:21.522
He's making a gesture.

21:21.557 --> 21:23.991
Bigger effort for
us than for him.

21:24.059 --> 21:26.461
( Sighs ) Honestly,
the two of you.

21:28.063 --> 21:29.297
Ahoy, mateys.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.966
- Permission to come aboard?
- Permission granted.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.068
June: You probably need
a hand in the kitchen?

21:34.103 --> 21:35.970
Nucky: No, everything's
been taken care of.

21:37.739 --> 21:39.273
Who's up for a swim first?

21:39.308 --> 21:41.943
( Children's voices overlapping ) I am!
Me first! Me!

21:47.416 --> 21:49.117
You tend to that roof yet?

21:49.151 --> 21:50.718
I'll get around to it.

21:50.752 --> 21:53.888
- It don't fix itself.
- Weems: Natural fact.

21:53.956 --> 21:56.123
Oscar: House goes to you, Winston.
You mind that.

21:56.191 --> 21:59.126
Levi: A lot to look
after, I tell you what.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.431
House belonged to
my sister Eulalia.

22:03.465 --> 22:05.833
- How that?
- Don't keep nothing in my name,

22:05.868 --> 22:07.869
not a damn thing.

22:08.804 --> 22:10.338
She my mother.

22:10.372 --> 22:13.608
- When did she pass?
- 12 year now.

22:13.642 --> 22:15.509
And Winston needed raising.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.279
I'd have made a place for
you, Oscar, you know that.

22:19.181 --> 22:20.781
I don't know that.

22:22.251 --> 22:23.885
Set you up proper in town.

22:23.919 --> 22:26.988
I didn't have to. I came
here because I meant to.

22:27.022 --> 22:29.090
When you're done, you're done.

22:29.124 --> 22:30.091
Ain't that right?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.292
- Natural fact.
- Mm-hmm.

22:31.326 --> 22:32.493
Tell you what.

22:32.527 --> 22:34.762
Set me up, with the
mess you make.

22:35.664 --> 22:37.231
Don't never do no business

22:37.266 --> 22:40.034
with no ofay smile
you don't have to.

22:40.102 --> 22:42.803
He's your friend? Not
your friend now.

22:42.838 --> 22:44.839
Yeah, don't ever go near

22:44.906 --> 22:47.942
no biggity da-da-da
from New York.

22:47.976 --> 22:50.978
- A lot of sugar up there.
- What you know about it?

22:51.013 --> 22:53.814
- Just a tangle of vipers.
- It different now.

22:53.849 --> 22:55.689
It ain't different, Albert.
It ain't different.

22:55.713 --> 22:57.918
You're all lit up and faster,
but ain't no different.

22:57.953 --> 23:00.788
And you forget who you are.

23:00.822 --> 23:04.759
You come runnin' down here
with some easy rider woman

23:04.793 --> 23:06.260
by your side.

23:06.294 --> 23:09.830
'Cause you don't know
which way to turn.

23:09.865 --> 23:11.232
Ain't that so?

23:11.266 --> 23:13.234
Huh?

23:13.268 --> 23:16.804
I come to you for help, Oscar.

23:16.872 --> 23:18.172
Look around you.

23:18.206 --> 23:21.008
How we gonna help you here?

23:21.042 --> 23:22.743
Huh?

23:27.682 --> 23:29.250
We all go down the shore.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.718
And do what?

23:30.752 --> 23:33.053
( Chuckles ) Wash
them boys away.

23:33.121 --> 23:35.956
Ah. Where your sense at?

23:35.991 --> 23:37.424
Scrapper: Don't scare me none.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.160
'Cause you ain't never done it.

23:41.997 --> 23:45.199
Damn. Ayleese!

23:45.233 --> 23:47.802
This chicken dry as
Grandma's snatch.

23:47.836 --> 23:49.636
- Ayleese!
- She ain't here today, Mr. Boneau.

23:49.660 --> 23:52.072
Well, who's that
standin' over there?

23:52.107 --> 23:53.774
Who are you?

23:54.910 --> 23:56.810
The easy rider.

23:58.547 --> 24:01.749
Easy... ah! Bluetick.

24:01.783 --> 24:04.251
( Chuckling )

24:04.286 --> 24:06.487
Sure hope she worth it, Albert.

24:06.555 --> 24:08.289
She sure can't
cook worth a damn.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.958
- ( Chuckling )
- Damn.

24:15.830 --> 24:17.698
( Knock on door )

24:19.200 --> 24:22.603
- You're here.
- Yes. I was gonna call as soon as I...

24:22.637 --> 24:23.704
I wasn't in.

24:23.738 --> 24:26.473
I've been out.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.209
Just walking everywhere.

24:29.244 --> 24:33.347
Places that I haven't
been in years.

24:33.381 --> 24:36.884
It's all remarkable.

24:38.119 --> 24:39.119
Are you all right?

24:39.154 --> 24:40.654
Of course.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.256
- You're not, uh...
- No, no.

24:42.290 --> 24:43.930
'Cause that's something
you need to fight,

24:43.954 --> 24:46.160
- no matter how strong...
- Roy, it's not that.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.495
It's...

24:48.530 --> 24:50.364
I feel...

24:52.100 --> 24:54.101
I'm free.

24:55.103 --> 24:57.571
I'm finally free.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.344
( laughs )

25:04.412 --> 25:06.714
( children playing )

25:06.748 --> 25:09.550
( seagulls screeching )

25:15.990 --> 25:19.059
I know it's not
convenient out here.

25:20.195 --> 25:21.762
Not a problem.

25:27.836 --> 25:29.837
Under the circumstances.

25:29.871 --> 25:33.173
- And we still keep everything...
- Looking normal.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.780
Cocksucking Chalky.

25:39.848 --> 25:42.483
He made his bed.

25:42.517 --> 25:44.117
The fuck happened in that car?

25:44.152 --> 25:47.054
He's on the lam, facedown
in a ditch somewhere.

25:47.088 --> 25:49.790
For what? Didn't I warn him?

25:49.824 --> 25:53.093
And now I'm sitting across from...
whatever he is.

25:53.127 --> 25:55.188
Doctor or something.

25:55.212 --> 25:57.297
He's telling me
what I have to do?

25:57.365 --> 25:59.700
- Telling me.
- Like you're his boy.

26:00.969 --> 26:03.971
There is no goddamn peace.

26:09.644 --> 26:12.279
We squeaked by last time.

26:12.347 --> 26:13.914
You ready for that again?

26:15.984 --> 26:18.585
I just roll over? That's
what you suggest?

26:18.620 --> 26:20.687
Hear me out.

26:20.722 --> 26:22.789
Let's get everyone
to sit down...

26:22.824 --> 26:25.025
Us, New York, Florida.

26:25.059 --> 26:27.194
- Work out terms.
- Just a friendly little...

26:27.228 --> 26:28.948
You said it yourself
that night in the Ritz,

26:28.972 --> 26:31.898
all work together,
take the next step.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.634
Maybe now's the time.

26:33.668 --> 26:36.536
Get the rules in place,
put an end to this.

26:36.571 --> 26:38.205
I'm not in the Ritz anymore.

26:38.239 --> 26:39.806
Don't you want it back?

26:40.942 --> 26:44.511
I want it back. All of it.

26:44.545 --> 26:47.948
Set it up now, Nuck, while
there's still a hand to play.

26:56.858 --> 26:58.759
Who don't you trust?

27:00.795 --> 27:04.965
- Huh?
- On our side, who don't you trust?

27:07.368 --> 27:08.969
Why are you even asking?

27:09.937 --> 27:11.538
Because I'm curious.

27:12.473 --> 27:14.307
Bader.

27:14.375 --> 27:16.143
Bader's nothing.

27:16.210 --> 27:18.845
I'll deal with Bader.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.348
Means told me there's
a skunk in my cellar.

27:21.382 --> 27:23.950
The Justice guy?

27:23.985 --> 27:26.253
He's a bunco artist,
start to finish.

27:26.287 --> 27:27.888
200 grand, he says.
Believe that?

27:27.955 --> 27:30.290
- There you go.
- But what's he got?

27:30.324 --> 27:33.493
Pay him and find out, you
think it's worth it.

27:34.896 --> 27:37.364
The Prohee.

27:40.268 --> 27:42.869
- Knox?
- You had concerns.

27:42.904 --> 27:47.173
Uh... that was just during
the whole Eddie thing.

27:48.276 --> 27:49.743
Who knew what was going on?

27:49.777 --> 27:51.778
What's your take, though?

27:51.812 --> 27:53.914
Far as I can see,
he likes the money.

27:56.450 --> 27:58.718
Be your headache one day.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.289
Mine?

28:02.356 --> 28:05.525
And you can deal with all of it.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.794
You off somewhere?

28:07.828 --> 28:10.063
( Knocking )

28:10.097 --> 28:12.699
Ma wants to know where you
keep the chafing dishes.

28:20.474 --> 28:23.243
It's a fraction of what it's
worth, but it doesn't matter.

28:23.277 --> 28:25.312
You said it yourself...
It's too big.

28:25.379 --> 28:26.479
It's too big for here.

28:26.514 --> 28:29.115
Those people don't
come to town anymore.

28:29.150 --> 28:31.384
And it's a substantial
sum, after all.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.620
I mean, how much does
anybody really need?

28:33.654 --> 28:36.589
And he'll be better off.
He will be.

28:36.624 --> 28:39.626
It hurts to say it,
but I know it's true.

28:39.660 --> 28:41.761
And maybe someday...

28:44.465 --> 28:46.266
I'm nattering.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.268
Not an appealing quality.

28:48.302 --> 28:51.337
I'm stopping. I'm eating.

28:51.372 --> 28:52.772
Good girl.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.976
Well, you made the right decision.
I'm happy for you.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.948
You don't look happy.

29:01.982 --> 29:03.917
I don't?

29:05.486 --> 29:07.754
That's funny.

29:07.788 --> 29:09.889
Got what I wanted, finally.

29:09.924 --> 29:12.492
What's that?

29:14.862 --> 29:16.596
Merger's going through.

29:16.630 --> 29:20.467
A&P's gonna buy us out for
a pretty staggering price.

29:20.534 --> 29:22.035
Roy.

29:22.069 --> 29:24.137
It had me on edge for...

29:24.171 --> 29:26.439
Well, more than a little,
I can say that now.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.875
Turns out it was Hewson who
was standing in the way.

29:28.909 --> 29:30.743
I... I don't...

29:30.778 --> 29:33.513
While we had drinks
with him and his wife?

29:33.547 --> 29:36.049
- When you and I were married?
- Yes, from...

29:36.083 --> 29:38.284
Indiana. Anyway...

29:38.319 --> 29:40.053
He was pouring honey in my ear,

29:40.087 --> 29:42.722
but he was against
it from the start.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.657
The muckety-mucks
gave him the boot.

29:44.692 --> 29:48.461
He didn't go quietly, but
after that, smooth sailing.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.496
The lawyers signed
off yesterday.

29:50.531 --> 29:52.198
Big bonus for me.

29:53.801 --> 29:55.368
Why aren't we celebrating?

29:55.402 --> 29:56.869
I don't know.

29:58.706 --> 30:01.140
I hate when things end.

30:02.109 --> 30:04.043
What's ending?

30:04.111 --> 30:06.145
What I came here for.

30:07.047 --> 30:09.182
Where are you going?

30:10.217 --> 30:12.118
Wherever they send me.

30:15.656 --> 30:17.724
Have you been lying to me?

30:18.792 --> 30:22.128
- About what?
- Your wife.

30:22.162 --> 30:24.998
I didn't lie about that.

30:28.235 --> 30:30.570
Then what are you saying?

30:33.574 --> 30:35.775
You have been through so much,

30:35.809 --> 30:37.944
things I can't even imagine.

30:39.279 --> 30:42.315
You're very brave. I mean that.

30:42.349 --> 30:45.351
And right now you
look so beautiful.

30:47.821 --> 30:50.189
What an awfully
gallant good-bye.

30:50.257 --> 30:52.024
I'm not saying good-bye.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.294
I do have to leave.

30:55.329 --> 30:57.230
I want you to come with me.

30:57.264 --> 30:58.464
I want you to marry me.

30:58.499 --> 31:00.867
Really marry me.

31:01.969 --> 31:03.736
That's what I want.

31:07.574 --> 31:10.877
What's stopping you from asking?

31:12.146 --> 31:14.213
Hell, I thought I just did.

31:16.850 --> 31:18.651
( Children laughing )

31:18.685 --> 31:21.754
- What does he do?
- I'm not supposed to talk about it.

31:21.788 --> 31:25.224
- If you can't tell your family...
- Should I?

31:25.259 --> 31:26.726
I'd say we're all pretty good

31:26.760 --> 31:29.328
at keeping things
close to the vest.

31:29.396 --> 31:31.430
- Not sure about you.
- I can keep my mouth shut.

31:31.465 --> 31:33.466
- Boy: No, you can't.
- You just said something.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.701
- I didn't know we started.
- June: Tell us.

31:35.736 --> 31:38.170
Well, he shuts his office door,

31:38.205 --> 31:40.106
walks around with
his trousers off.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.173
( laughter )

31:41.208 --> 31:42.208
The mayor?

31:42.276 --> 31:43.676
Doesn't want to
get 'em wrinkled.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.510
Sounds to me like a winning
campaign strategy.

31:45.534 --> 31:48.114
I don't know. I think Bacharach
might beat the pants off him.

31:48.148 --> 31:51.317
( laughter )

31:51.385 --> 31:53.085
Pretty good, huh?

31:53.120 --> 31:55.621
Next stop: the Steel Pier.

31:55.656 --> 31:57.056
"Beat the pants off him."

31:57.090 --> 31:58.391
He could be in vaudeville.

31:58.425 --> 31:59.892
"Dr. Kronkheit! Dr. Kronkheit!"

31:59.926 --> 32:02.928
"I got rheumatism on
the back of my neck."

32:02.963 --> 32:05.531
- That's him to a T.
- What's that supposed to mean?

32:05.565 --> 32:08.401
June: Every little sniffle,
it's the end of the world.

32:08.435 --> 32:10.096
This is not me at all.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.880
That insurance salesman
sure had your number.

32:11.904 --> 32:13.839
- Huh?
- Played him like a fiddle.

32:13.874 --> 32:15.908
"What happens to your family?

32:15.942 --> 32:17.782
Mr. Thompson, I know a
fella just like you..."

32:17.844 --> 32:19.164
Nothing wrong with
planning ahead.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.780
Real blue-eyed baby
face, you know?

32:20.847 --> 32:22.682
Choirboy type.

32:22.716 --> 32:25.356
Wouldn't think all he wants to do
is sell you the most expensive...

32:25.380 --> 32:27.486
June, just shut your
goddamn trap for once.

32:27.521 --> 32:30.056
Okay? Just shut it.

32:38.432 --> 32:42.635
Enough with the teasing.
That's all.

32:50.977 --> 32:54.046
( Music playing )

32:59.619 --> 33:02.054
Got me a "round-day-voos"
in "Balmer."

33:02.088 --> 33:03.289
Oscar: Get away from me, boy.

33:03.323 --> 33:05.391
Levi: Don't let me keep you.

33:05.425 --> 33:07.665
- Weems: Ain't for another hour.
- Get your hands off me.

33:07.689 --> 33:09.495
- Levi: Then play like you playing.
- Stop.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.197
( Groans )

33:11.264 --> 33:13.199
Can't get settled.

33:15.268 --> 33:17.336
He doin' all right in there?

33:18.438 --> 33:20.606
He get real tired around now,

33:20.640 --> 33:22.808
but he don't like to lay down.

33:22.842 --> 33:24.310
Fussin'.

33:24.344 --> 33:27.279
- Old man and a baby.
- What's that?

33:27.314 --> 33:28.447
Different and the same.

33:28.481 --> 33:30.449
Baby got their whole
life in front of 'em.

33:30.483 --> 33:33.018
Plus he ain't got to pay
to suck on no tittie.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.054
Keep your problems to yourself.

33:35.121 --> 33:37.122
You gonna make a move?

33:44.030 --> 33:45.431
( Scoffs )

33:52.038 --> 33:55.074
You win. I'll see
you browns later.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.243
Ain't driving down to fetch you
this time you get all lushed.

33:58.278 --> 33:59.878
Gonna play?

34:03.583 --> 34:04.783
Call it.

34:06.186 --> 34:07.252
Heads.

34:08.188 --> 34:09.722
You're black.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.397
All right now.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.234
( Oscar groaning )

34:30.976 --> 34:33.045
So you the biggety man?

34:33.079 --> 34:36.114
- How that?
- Uncle say.

34:36.149 --> 34:39.251
- I do my business.
- Tell me all about you.

34:39.284 --> 34:42.087
That so?

34:42.121 --> 34:43.755
Like you blood.

34:44.891 --> 34:46.425
Well...

34:48.194 --> 34:49.761
we go back.

34:52.331 --> 34:53.799
I ain't afraid or nothin'.

34:57.437 --> 34:58.837
Your move.

35:11.451 --> 35:13.452
Why don't you play a while?

35:36.509 --> 35:38.510
( Distant train horn blaring )

35:38.544 --> 35:40.345
( sniffles )

35:42.815 --> 35:45.784
Doesn't like my cooking.

35:45.818 --> 35:48.687
From a different time, that all.

35:48.721 --> 35:50.389
Is he, though?

35:56.396 --> 35:58.463
What are we doing?

36:00.833 --> 36:03.468
- Waiting.
- For what?

36:03.536 --> 36:07.439
You got a family, a
girl getting married.

36:07.473 --> 36:09.141
What that matter to me now?

36:09.175 --> 36:10.642
You only think you quit.

36:10.676 --> 36:13.045
Don't I know what I feel?

36:14.947 --> 36:16.581
You want those men dead.

36:16.616 --> 36:20.819
The one who's your enemy and
the one you called a friend...

36:20.887 --> 36:22.421
don't you?

36:27.126 --> 36:30.028
You wasn't nothing but a baby
in that Storyville crib.

36:30.062 --> 36:34.199
- No.
- Who the man that save you?

36:34.267 --> 36:36.034
I told you. The doctor.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.603
And who the man steal
your mama life away?

36:41.374 --> 36:43.408
I didn't know my name.

36:45.211 --> 36:49.347
He called me Daughter,
and that's who I am.

36:53.653 --> 36:56.021
Let's leave.

36:56.055 --> 36:58.623
Right now.

36:58.658 --> 37:01.426
Let's run and never look back.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.232
All you gotta do is say it.

37:11.571 --> 37:14.039
( Footsteps )

37:14.073 --> 37:16.007
Uncle looking for you.

37:16.042 --> 37:17.709
He real restless.

37:26.485 --> 37:29.020
- Do you get to choose where?
- Well, where would you like?

37:29.055 --> 37:30.722
Whatever is farthest from here.

37:30.756 --> 37:32.490
- Japan.
- Closer, please.

37:32.558 --> 37:33.758
Uh, California.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.327
What's our house
gonna look like?

37:35.361 --> 37:37.195
It'll be smaller than
the one you have now.

37:37.229 --> 37:40.365
- No, but not too small.
- No, I'll make sure it suits you.

37:40.399 --> 37:41.733
I'll have my own
money, you know.

37:41.767 --> 37:44.035
You're gonna hold on to
that for when you need it.

37:44.070 --> 37:45.370
You want me depending on you.

37:45.404 --> 37:47.939
I want you to feel as
free as you do right now.

37:56.082 --> 37:57.549
We should go.

37:59.452 --> 38:02.320
I'll pull up. It'll
be easier to get in.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.595
The key's hiding somewhere.

38:12.298 --> 38:14.065
- Here.
- ( jingling )

38:19.472 --> 38:21.005
Man: Phillips.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.175
( Engine starting )

38:24.210 --> 38:26.010
- Roy.
- Yeah.

38:26.112 --> 38:27.679
Phillips.

38:33.352 --> 38:34.786
Hewson.

38:36.255 --> 38:38.323
- What brings you here?
- Celebrating?

38:38.357 --> 38:39.824
Just having dinner.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.494
- You and your whore there.
- Hey, that's over the line.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.761
I'm over the line?

38:43.796 --> 38:45.530
I lost my job because of you,

38:45.564 --> 38:47.499
you backstabbing prick.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.401
After 15 years.

38:50.436 --> 38:53.004
- Roy, don't.
- What do I have now?

38:53.038 --> 38:55.340
I'll show you how it feels
to have your life ruined.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.842
- You back off.
- Gillian: Roy, no.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.070
Roy.

38:59.094 --> 39:00.974
I'll show you how it feels
to lose everything...

39:00.998 --> 39:02.532
- ( gunshot )
- ( gasps )

39:06.185 --> 39:08.219
I thought he would...

39:08.254 --> 39:09.821
I thought he had a...

39:09.855 --> 39:11.956
Roy, we need to go.

39:12.024 --> 39:14.192
- We need to go.
- I should hang on to that.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.728
You need to drive. Go. Hurry.

39:18.964 --> 39:20.064
Get in.

39:20.099 --> 39:21.866
Hurry.

39:29.975 --> 39:32.076
( Chatter )

39:33.579 --> 39:35.380
You're caught.

39:36.682 --> 39:38.850
Don't worry, we'll
both go down together.

39:45.724 --> 39:47.859
What do you think
that was about?

39:52.398 --> 39:54.832
I wouldn't take
it too seriously.

39:54.867 --> 39:58.002
It's always been pretty easy
to get your father's goat.

39:58.036 --> 39:59.504
Really?

39:59.538 --> 40:01.873
Just mention Mary
Anne Nolan to him.

40:01.907 --> 40:05.643
- Who's she?
- Eighth grade crush.

40:05.677 --> 40:08.146
He wrote her a poem.

40:08.180 --> 40:10.314
Happy day when I found it.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.286
Can't blame him for
worrying, though.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.989
You have to think about what's
gonna happen after you're gone.

40:18.023 --> 40:20.224
For the sake of all of you.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.461
That insurance fella, though...

40:23.495 --> 40:25.930
Sounds like a real sharpie.

40:25.964 --> 40:28.266
I didn't hear very much of it.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.335
- You met him?
- Just for a minute.

40:31.370 --> 40:33.838
Like your mother said?

40:33.906 --> 40:36.007
- What?
- Baby face?

40:36.041 --> 40:38.943
Yeah, I guess.

40:40.112 --> 40:41.779
Ever see him before?

40:41.847 --> 40:43.581
No.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.683
You're sure now?

40:47.753 --> 40:51.522
Whatever you tell me, Will,
it's just between us.

40:51.590 --> 40:53.824
That's what we agreed to.

40:56.728 --> 40:58.162
- Uncle Nucky, I...
- ( door opens )

40:58.196 --> 40:59.597
Shit.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.466
I don't notice anything.

41:02.501 --> 41:05.136
Just taking in the breeze.

41:05.170 --> 41:06.804
The girls and I put
everything away.

41:06.838 --> 41:08.572
You didn't have to do that.

41:08.607 --> 41:11.142
I feel better knowing
the place is tidy.

41:20.619 --> 41:21.919
I can't hardly sleep.

41:21.953 --> 41:24.588
All this, uh, extra time,

41:24.623 --> 41:27.191
you know, when you get old, you
ain't got nothing to do with it.

41:27.225 --> 41:28.893
You said done was done.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.162
Yeah, but it don't mean
I have to like it.

41:31.196 --> 41:33.331
- ( Chuckling )
- Got the boys runnin' some action.

41:33.365 --> 41:38.102
You know, a little
moonshining, some numbers...

41:38.136 --> 41:40.771
Eh, but it don't amount to much.

41:40.806 --> 41:42.540
Where your money go?

41:42.574 --> 41:44.842
I didn't make half as
much as you think.

41:44.876 --> 41:47.678
I took in what the
Commodore let me take in.

41:47.746 --> 41:49.080
I had no choice.

41:49.114 --> 41:51.415
He gone now, three year back.

41:51.450 --> 41:55.453
Man, I don't miss him.
I do not miss him.

41:55.487 --> 41:58.522
( Both chuckling )

41:58.557 --> 42:02.760
But you did your business with
the Thompson boy, though.

42:03.929 --> 42:06.397
- Help him plenty.
- Mm-hmm.

42:06.431 --> 42:08.799
Now how did that
buckra pay you back?

42:12.604 --> 42:14.338
What I do now, Oscar?

42:14.372 --> 42:18.776
You stay here, you
build something up.

42:18.844 --> 42:20.244
That's for your nephew.

42:20.278 --> 42:22.379
Winston ain't never gonna
amount to nothing.

42:22.414 --> 42:25.616
You stay here, and
cut that woman loose

42:25.650 --> 42:27.351
'fore she do you in proper.

42:27.385 --> 42:28.886
She ain't to blame for this.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.921
And if she ain't, then you are.

42:33.325 --> 42:35.926
Well, damn, you
do what you want.

42:35.961 --> 42:38.596
It all winds up the same anyway.

42:39.798 --> 42:41.765
What that mean?

42:41.800 --> 42:46.136
The day come, everybody
gonna run out of road.

42:57.048 --> 43:00.284
- Any parting words?
- Like what?

43:00.318 --> 43:02.519
- We...
- We thank you, sir,

43:02.587 --> 43:05.456
- for having us.
- Long overdue.

43:05.490 --> 43:08.826
Anyway, your mother wound
up doing everything.

43:08.860 --> 43:10.294
All right, you're free.

43:15.867 --> 43:17.901
He's drinking again.

43:19.304 --> 43:20.804
I wish he wouldn't.

43:20.839 --> 43:23.173
Puts him in a mood.

43:24.409 --> 43:26.076
Willie quitting school.

43:27.812 --> 43:29.380
Would you like me
to talk to him?

43:29.414 --> 43:31.348
No. It'll all be fine.

43:35.253 --> 43:37.621
Thank you for a day off.

43:50.235 --> 43:52.503
Nucky: Eli.

43:54.906 --> 43:56.673
Eli.

44:09.287 --> 44:11.455
What's up?

44:14.759 --> 44:17.261
"Tell me what you want to hear"

44:17.295 --> 44:19.563
I'll whisper softly in your ear

44:19.597 --> 44:22.065
All the things I'll pledge to do

44:22.100 --> 44:25.402
"To prove to you
my heart is true."

44:25.436 --> 44:28.305
Ah, come on.

44:28.339 --> 44:29.840
Bringing that up for?

44:29.874 --> 44:31.642
To see how you react.

44:31.676 --> 44:34.678
I was 13.

44:34.712 --> 44:36.280
She was cute.

44:36.347 --> 44:38.181
Maybe I was jealous.

44:38.216 --> 44:40.350
You were?

44:40.385 --> 44:42.953
I didn't win the
beach patrol cup.

44:44.856 --> 44:46.890
You were good at other things.

44:53.598 --> 44:56.633
What you suggested...
The meeting.

44:57.869 --> 45:00.170
I thought it over.

45:00.204 --> 45:03.807
You put it together,
soon as you can.

45:05.043 --> 45:06.543
Yeah.

45:08.413 --> 45:10.414
I think it's the best
way out of this.

45:23.428 --> 45:25.062
( Door closes )

45:36.040 --> 45:38.108
( quiet music playing )

45:50.254 --> 45:52.489
I'm awake.

46:06.804 --> 46:09.005
It feels so funny.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.774
How that?

46:13.945 --> 46:16.546
Like...

46:16.581 --> 46:18.648
a cloud...

46:20.351 --> 46:22.786
that's looking for the sky.

46:34.999 --> 46:38.068
Tomorrow, we do what you say.

46:39.003 --> 46:41.504
First light.

46:41.539 --> 46:43.106
What?

46:46.510 --> 46:49.012
We go.

46:49.046 --> 46:50.814
Don't turn back.

47:06.197 --> 47:08.631
I thought I heard a car,

47:08.666 --> 47:11.434
but there's nothing out there.

47:11.469 --> 47:14.904
No one saw us, I'm sure of that.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.708
You haven't touched your drink.

47:18.743 --> 47:20.610
( Sniffles )

47:22.012 --> 47:24.581
- What?
- Go ahead.

47:24.615 --> 47:26.750
You need it.

47:38.496 --> 47:40.163
What did I do?

47:42.032 --> 47:43.967
- What did I do?
- He was going to kill us.

47:44.001 --> 47:46.469
- I don't know that.
- Why else was he waiting there?

47:46.504 --> 47:48.705
I don't know what
he was gonna do.

47:50.241 --> 47:52.275
There wasn't a gun.

47:54.512 --> 47:57.814
I killed a man. I took his life.

48:03.587 --> 48:05.355
How do you do this?

48:05.389 --> 48:06.789
Do what?

48:06.857 --> 48:09.459
Do I call the police
and wait here...

48:09.527 --> 48:11.261
You're not calling the police.

48:11.295 --> 48:14.264
- He's lying on the pavement...
- You can't call the police.

48:14.298 --> 48:17.667
You can't go away.

48:17.701 --> 48:21.037
- You hear me?
- It's too late.

48:21.071 --> 48:22.739
I have to, I'm sorry.

48:22.806 --> 48:24.340
Roy.

48:28.979 --> 48:31.381
No one was there.

48:32.883 --> 48:34.817
( Kisses )

48:34.852 --> 48:36.586
No one knows.

48:38.355 --> 48:40.590
You can just... ( sighs )

48:41.525 --> 48:42.892
let it go.

48:42.926 --> 48:47.063
- What?
- Just let it go.

48:49.533 --> 48:52.802
Get away... with it.

48:55.239 --> 48:56.639
No one saw you.

48:56.707 --> 49:00.443
I saw me.

49:00.477 --> 49:02.378
- God saw me.
- You can live with it.

49:02.413 --> 49:05.648
- You can't know that.
- Yes, I can.

49:09.119 --> 49:10.820
I don't understand.

49:14.625 --> 49:17.794
There was no one for me.

49:19.730 --> 49:23.299
No one coming to save me.

49:25.269 --> 49:28.037
There were things I had to do

49:28.071 --> 49:29.772
to survive.

49:31.775 --> 49:33.309
What are you saying?

49:35.612 --> 49:37.180
I...

49:41.218 --> 49:44.053
It wasn't my son who died here.

49:46.256 --> 49:48.191
It was a boy.

49:49.326 --> 49:51.327
An innocent boy.

49:51.361 --> 49:52.995
I...

49:54.398 --> 49:56.065
drowned him.

49:58.669 --> 50:00.703
I made up a story.

50:01.772 --> 50:03.773
Turned his body to ash.

50:08.111 --> 50:10.913
You and I are here

50:10.948 --> 50:13.382
together.

50:13.417 --> 50:15.518
That's all that matters.

50:17.688 --> 50:19.622
Don't leave me.

50:21.091 --> 50:22.992
Who was he?

50:26.797 --> 50:29.265
His name...

50:29.333 --> 50:31.200
was Roger.

50:36.373 --> 50:39.442
You can make yourself
live with anything.

50:53.457 --> 50:55.591
You get that?

50:56.593 --> 50:57.993
I did.

50:58.028 --> 51:01.263
- Roy: David?
- Loud and clear.

51:01.298 --> 51:03.833
- Gillian.
- Roy?

51:03.867 --> 51:05.334
I need you to listen carefully.

51:05.368 --> 51:08.938
I'm with the Pinkerton
Detective Agency.

51:08.972 --> 51:11.173
These men are my associates

51:11.208 --> 51:13.342

- As they will duly testify

51:15.879 --> 51:18.013
- in a court of law.
- We're going to California.

51:18.048 --> 51:19.582
We are not.

51:19.616 --> 51:22.251
I was hired to do a job.

51:23.687 --> 51:25.554
And now that job's done.

51:26.490 --> 51:29.758
I owed Louis something.

51:29.793 --> 51:31.927
I'm sure you can
understand that.

51:39.903 --> 51:42.638
You really are a
courageous woman.

51:44.541 --> 51:47.109
