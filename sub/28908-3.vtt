All right, gang,
I'd ask you how your summer was,

00:13.722 --> 00:16.725
but since we spent it together,
I know it was awesome.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.060
It's like we never left.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.396
Whoa! You know, maybe we never did.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.026

00:31.239 --> 00:34.117

00:36.327 --> 00:38.329
You guys did such a great job
in summer school,

00:38.413 --> 00:39.247
it gave me an idea.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.543
I want our class to represent the school
in this year's academic decathlon

00:43.626 --> 00:46.588
-at the end of the semester.
-That's what the honors students do.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.967
Yeah. Well, you could challenge them,
and you could beat them.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.343
Who's in?

00:52.844 --> 00:54.721

I see you downloaded the Heckler app.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.978
Look, in all seriousness, you guys,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.938
you could do this if you really wanted to.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.691
Exactly. If we wanted to.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.653
We know you want us to thrive,
Mr. Iglesias,

01:10.737 --> 01:12.906
-but we're happy just getting by.
-Mm-hmm.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.242
You should put that on a T-shirt, Walt.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.954
Academic decathlon, Mr. Iglesias?

01:20.038 --> 01:21.247
That's a rich kid thing.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.958
They have tutors.
Their tutors have tutors.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.544
They live in two-story Tudors
with two-car garages,

01:26.628 --> 01:29.297

01:50.860 --> 01:51.861

01:57.200 --> 02:00.537
I pitched Principal Madison the idea
of creating a new position:

02:01.162 --> 02:03.164
school security czar.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.170
[in normal voice] Let me guess,

02:09.254 --> 02:11.881
you've nominated
someone completely unqualified:

02:11.965 --> 02:12.841
yourself.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.636
Precisely, and if all goes smoothly,

02:16.719 --> 02:20.473
Principal Madison will allow me to place
that position on my business card.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.767
Uh, what's a business card?

02:24.435 --> 02:26.146
Something you'll probably never have.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.108
Something no one under 40 will ever have.

02:32.026 --> 02:37.782
Nevertheless, say hello to the linchpin

02:38.116 --> 02:40.702
Clear backpacks?
What are you, Gwen Stefani?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.497
I ain't no hollaback girl.

02:51.504 --> 02:55.008
From now on, all students are to use these
so that contraband can be easily spotted.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.802
I thought plastic bags were outlawed
in California.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.931
This is an injustice.
It's clearly unconstitutional.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.267
Yeah, clear-- [chuckles] Oh, I get it.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.648
That's adorable.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.527
Mr. Iglesias probably taught you
that you have rights. You don't.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.737
You're students.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.990

easier for them to check our papers.

Look, if you guys hate these backpacks,
then you need to let your voices be heard.

This country's foundation

So let's do everything in our power
to make sure things don't run smoothly.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.308
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

04:27.684 --> 04:28.851
Maybe.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.937
You know, as a teacher,

04:31.020 --> 04:33.064
I probably shouldn't encourage
civil unrest,

04:33.147 --> 04:36.526
but in America,
if you don't like the rules, you protest.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.444
And the worst thing they can do
is make sure

04:38.528 --> 04:40.196

They'll fall behind.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.958
Yeah, and if they fall far enough behind
the rest of the herd,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.503
I can pick them off, one by one.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.923
They're students, not boogers.

12:01.345 --> 12:05.516
[all chanting] My backpack, my choice!
My backpack, my choice!

12:05.933 --> 12:10.688
And one step closer to suspension
in five, four, three, two--

12:10.771 --> 12:12.481
Hold up, stop the clock.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.608
It's time for class.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.027
Well, look who it is, the Pep Boys.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.074
Manny, Moe, and Jack-in-the-box.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.747
Mr. Gomez, Mr. Trujillo,
what are you guys doing here?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.081
We're helping Mr. Iglesias.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.083
-Why?
-Because we like him!

12:32.918 --> 12:34.837
And we're kinda "meh" on you.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.301
And pretty much anywhere
these brilliant teachers go

12:40.384 --> 12:41.510
becomes a classroom.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.053
So now you can't mark them absent.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.889
Uh, don't mark me anything.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.808
I don't wanna be on the list.
That's how they get ya.

12:50.019 --> 12:50.853
Who's "they"?

12:51.395 --> 12:54.190
[chuckles] Nice try.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.651
Very clever, Mr. Iglesias.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.071
You've bought them more time,
but I have not yet begun to fight.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.242
I imagine when you do, there'll be
a lot of clawing, scratching, and crying.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.037
Precisely.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.710
Okay, kids,
who here can say "photosynthesis"?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.170
Not me.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.923
Best part of this protest was
missing class. I'm out.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.092
Well, let's be honest.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.470
Walt lasted a lot longer
than we thought he would.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.014
[computer] Photosynthesis.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.312
I am so excited
to move into Gabe's building.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.356
Are you sure he's cool with it?

13:35.439 --> 13:37.358
Are you kidding? It was his idea.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.567
Oh!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.238
I'll have to find a way to thank him.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.948
It was kinda my idea first.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.202
And it won't go unrewarded, with scones!

13:50.120 --> 13:51.497
-Scones?
-Yes!

13:51.580 --> 13:54.041
That way, you'll be in the friend-scone.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
Well, I am buttery and delicious.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.338
[door opens]

13:59.839 --> 14:03.551
Okay, I just saved my protestors
an unexcused absence.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.095
Thanks, Gabe.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.640
Oh, well, don't thank me yet.
You know, we still have a standoff.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.811
No, I'm so excited
about this next chapter in our lives.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.021
What do you mean "chapter"?
What are you talking about?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.148
Abby's taking you up on your offer. 

14:18.649 --> 14:20.401
We're gonna be next-door neighbors!

14:20.484 --> 14:22.319
[laughing] That's great.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.531
[silently mouthing]

14:30.202 --> 14:31.495
It sure is!

14:34.331 --> 14:37.167
[chuckles] What did you do, bro?

14:38.002 --> 14:38.878
Bro, listen,

14:38.961 --> 14:41.380
if all goes according to my plan
with Abby,

14:41.630 --> 14:42.882
we won't be bothering you much.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.342
What plan?

14:45.843 --> 14:46.760
Look...

14:47.761 --> 14:50.222
-I offer her my truck to move...
-Okay.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.558
...she sees these Aztec pythons
in a tank top...

14:53.183 --> 14:54.310
Mm-hmm?

14:54.393 --> 14:56.228
...little flex while carrying her stuff,

14:56.312 --> 14:58.397
she falls in love,
we're out the friend zone,

14:58.480 --> 15:00.691
driving up the coast to Montecito.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.611
Yeah. Despacito, Montecito.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.784
Hey, guys. We're standing strong
in hour three at Wilson High

15:10.868 --> 15:12.620
on behalf of every student in America.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.123
[computer]
Three of whom are watching. No, two.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.167
Now it's just me.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.921
Hey, man, what-- what are you doing?

15:22.004 --> 15:24.214
Have you never heard
of facial recognition software?

15:24.298 --> 15:27.009
You just uploaded my image
to the black helicopters in the sky.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.218
Oh, my God!

15:31.138 --> 15:32.306
Well, damn.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.224
I lost signal.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.435
Looking for this?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.482
No. Why, what is it?

15:42.149 --> 15:43.400
It's the router.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.904
I'm sure you're wondering,
"Why, oh, why is there no Wi-Fi?"

15:47.237 --> 15:49.531
[computer] No, you can't do that.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.825
The Internet is my best friend.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.619
Then I guess you should know,

15:53.702 --> 15:56.121
the Internet is seeing other people.
A-boom!

15:58.582 --> 15:59.500
What's the matter?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.710
Cat got your keyboard? A-boom!

16:01.794 --> 16:03.128
[panting]

16:03.963 --> 16:05.255
Mr. Hernandez!

16:05.339 --> 16:07.424
Yo, what's happening?
She's-- She's talking.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.176
Shh! Let her go.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.887
I used to have that haircut. [chuckles]

16:12.096 --> 16:14.348
Then my mom got a job.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.268
Excuse me?

16:18.352 --> 16:19.311
Did I stutter?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.106
Wow, Grace.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.900
You should talk in public more often.
You're great at it.

16:26.568 --> 16:27.486
A-boom!

16:32.449 --> 16:33.659
Dang, Mr. Hernandez.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.203
Your meanness
cured Grace's social anxiety.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.331
And my meanness can ban the Fortnite club.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.875
-[scoffs] You wouldn't do that.
-Try me.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.211
I just killed Grace's best friend.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.843
Sorry, Marisol. It's not worth the risk.
Don't think less of me?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.469
Believe me, I couldn't.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.347
Thank you. [sighs]

16:56.974 --> 16:58.976
[whining]

17:00.269 --> 17:01.812
I've never seen Mikey so scared before.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.565
Let me guess,
you threatened to ban Fortnite club.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.360
Marisol, it's over.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.196
A one-person protest is just loitering.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.744
Well, that dance craze is over.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.662
Um, no, it's not. People still dub.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.208
It's actually, uh, "dab."
And that explains... that.

17:25.419 --> 17:29.631
Tell me what democracy looks like!
This is what democracy looks like!

17:30.174 --> 17:31.925
Oh, Carlos.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.720
It looks like you didn't do
what I told you to do

17:34.803 --> 17:36.346
and end this protest.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.432
Close, but no security czar.

17:39.058 --> 17:39.975
Maybe next year.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.437
That means never.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.982
Paula, seriously?
It's just Marisol, it's one, it's...

17:47.858 --> 17:49.234
Okay, look,

17:49.318 --> 17:51.737
the backpacks are non-refundable.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.656
-Can we just keep those, please?
-[Paula] Fine.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.159
But this is the last
of your dumbass ideas.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.620
Okay, what about no locks on the lockers?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.914
I'll think about it during Zumba.

18:02.372 --> 18:03.749
Oh, who am I kidding?

18:03.832 --> 18:06.710
Alejandro is teaching.
I will not be thinking about school.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.552
Marisol, you won! You did it!

18:15.636 --> 18:18.138
What are you talking about?
We still have to wear these.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.058
So? You have nothing to hide.
They're not so bad.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.643
No, you don't get it.

18:22.726 --> 18:26.605
It's not just about a clear backpack,
Mr. Iglesias, it's what it represents.

18:27.064 --> 18:27.940
Yeah, I know.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.691
What does it represent?

18:31.068 --> 18:32.653
It's the presumption of guilt.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.864
Do you think kids
at rich schools have to wear these? No.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.825
Because their school trusts them.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.536
Right. And our school is saying,

18:40.619 --> 18:43.247
"Hey, we know
you're just minding your own business,

18:43.330 --> 18:45.624
but, uh... [loudly]
...do you live in this neighborhood?"

18:46.542 --> 18:47.584
[Marisol] Yeah, exactly.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.795
You know, living your whole life
with everyone thinking

18:49.878 --> 18:52.464
you're always about to do something wrong
takes a toll.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.176
But what does it matter?
I'm the only one left.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.761
No.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.264
[sighs]

19:00.347 --> 19:01.557
No, you're not.

19:02.891 --> 19:03.767
You got me.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.944
-Walt?
-Mm-hmm.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.246
Every great relationship started
as friends.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.789
Ross and Rachel,

19:26.415 --> 19:27.708
Chandler and Monica,

19:28.876 --> 19:30.294
Tom Selleck and one of them.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.755
Abby and... somebody other than you.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.843
She is no match for my Latino heat.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.096
She's no match for you, that's for sure.
[chuckles]

19:43.807 --> 19:44.725
Yo, Abby.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.060
Since you're gonna be moving,

19:47.144 --> 19:49.646
thought maybe you might need
a strong pair of arms to help you.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.900
And I thought maybe afterwards, you know,

19:52.983 --> 19:54.359
-we can go hang--
-Aw, Tony,

19:54.443 --> 19:55.861
you know what I love about you?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.654
You are so genuine.

19:57.738 --> 20:01.116
It's nice to have a supportive male friend
with no ulterior motive.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.785
That's right.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.120
Just a helpful friend,

20:05.537 --> 20:08.957
looking to do nothing but platonic things
to you-- I mean, with you.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.005
You're amazing.
I'll leave the key under the mat.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.673
Wait-- Wait, what, what?

20:17.132 --> 20:20.260
All my boxes are labeled,
and there are a lot of them.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.888
So, lift with your legs,
and I'll see you when I get back.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.765
Back? Back from where?

20:24.848 --> 20:28.894
Oh, I'm going to Joshua Tree
to take a sound bath in the Integratron.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.605
That is the whitest thing I've ever heard.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.399
I am so excited to meditate

20:34.483 --> 20:37.319
to see if I can get the universe
to send better things my way.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.946
It already has!

20:40.656 --> 20:44.826
Thank you, universe, for sending me
such a strong, sincere friend

20:44.910 --> 20:46.370
who clearly picks up on signals.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.374
Oh, and you'll need the key
to my storage locker.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.875
That's where my piano is.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.801
How long do you think we'll have
to be out here before they give in?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.094
I don't know.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.430
The pipeline protest
at Standing Rock lasted ten months.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.684
-At least they stopped it, right?
-Oh, no, it's up and running.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.645
But don't worry,
you and I will figure out a way

21:11.728 --> 21:13.355
to get Carlos to give in on the backpacks.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.524
[sighs] How? You have any ideas?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.986
No, but I know somebody who could help.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.865
A very wise man
who never checks his text messages.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.492
Uh, just because I don't respond

21:25.575 --> 21:28.704
don't mean I'm not reading
your 15 damn text messages.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.917
[grunts] We're still protesting
the clear backpacks.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.294
Hey, love a good protest.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.004
Keeps my blood to pumping.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.924
Well, I wouldn't call this a good protest,
Mr. Hayward. It's just the two of us.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.177
Well, a protest doesn't derive its power
from numbers,

21:44.469 --> 21:46.888
it gets it from the worthiness
of its cause.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.016
You know, a very wise young lady taught me

21:49.099 --> 21:51.685
that these backpacks represent
a presumption of guilt.

21:51.768 --> 21:55.397
Yeah. Some kids get to enjoy
a presumption of innocence.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.773
Ah, that sounds fun.

21:56.898 --> 21:57.816
Yeah.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.320
Stays with them from high school
all into college.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.655
Sometimes, all the way
to the Supreme Court.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.535
Well, how do we convince Hernandez
that we deserve presumption of innocence?

22:09.286 --> 22:13.332
Well, a protest is really
just a negoti... ation.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.503
-What is this?
-Oh, that's hers.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.637
You win when you find
your opponent's Achilles' heel.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.433
And when he goes to protect that,
you break his arm.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.436
He misses the '60s.

22:35.979 --> 22:39.441
[imitating Tony Montana] All right, well,
I'm gonna say hello to my little friend.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.111
Principal Hernandez.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.572
No. [chuckles]
I won't hold for the governor.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.449
Tell--

22:52.954 --> 22:54.623
Trying out the big girl chair, huh?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.710
It's only a matter of time.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.090
I know you think you've won,

23:03.965 --> 23:06.843
but when Paula sees the effectiveness
of these backpacks,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.137
she'll want to implement
my entire program.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.556
Look, Carlos, you clearly don't understand
what it's like

23:11.640 --> 23:14.142
for a first-generation Latina
growing up in this country.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.353
I've seen Selena. [chuckles]

23:19.689 --> 23:20.524
Twice.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.778
Look, these kids live with a lot of fear,

23:24.861 --> 23:27.072
so presumption of guilt
kinda triggers them.

23:27.155 --> 23:30.617
But I'm sure you wouldn't know anything
about that growing up in... uh, Cuba.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.202
Are you kidding me?

23:32.285 --> 23:34.496
Presumption of guilt is in my DNA.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.457
In Cuba, El Comité would just waltz
into your house

23:37.541 --> 23:39.209
to see
if you were following Castro's rules.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.838
And I'm sure those rules were
perfectly reasonable, right?

23:42.921 --> 23:46.007
What? No. They would just walk in,
take whatever they wanted.

23:46.091 --> 23:50.637
My father had to swallow his pride...
and my mother's wedding ring.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.268
It took us a damn week
to get that ring back.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.606
We all took shifts looking for it.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.361
Sweet story.

24:07.612 --> 24:11.741
So, basically, growing up
in Castro's Cuba was a lot like living

24:11.825 --> 24:13.160
in a clear backpack.

24:13.243 --> 24:17.497
[chuckles] Iglesias, no, no, no, no, no.
This is completely different.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.875
I am doing this for the security
of everybody.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.377
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's what Fidel said to Che, you know.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.588
[imitating Castro] Oye, coño,
we take away their rights,

24:24.671 --> 24:25.922
we keep them safe.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.719
By the way, do I have a platanito
in my beard?

24:32.554 --> 24:35.265
So, I'm the Comité in this story?

24:36.349 --> 24:37.767
If the shoe fits, coño.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.813
[in normal voice]
You must feel terrible.

24:43.106 --> 24:45.692
I'm gonna leave you alone
with your conflicted thoughts.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.740
Now, of course, when we were marching,
we didn't have Fitbits.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.618
No, we had to count our own damn steps.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.539
-[Marisol] How'd it go?
-[sighs] We'll know soon.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.959
Well, the day's over.
You must have somewhere to be.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.545
Actually, no.
We're thinking about upping our demands.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.048
Taco Tuesdays and Thursdays.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.802
Carlos, are you gonna get these fools
out of my bullpen?

25:13.637 --> 25:17.307
No. Um, I've changed my mind.
I'm... I'm with them now.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.268
What the hell do you mean?

25:20.602 --> 25:22.729
Sounds like he's joining our protest.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.898
You don't have to join the protest, dummy.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.775
You can just call off
the whole backpack thing.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.277
I know. It's my first protest.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.905
I just wanna know what it feels like
to be on the right side.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.824
Can we do a... chant?

25:35.116 --> 25:36.076
Sure.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.327
[Paula] Huh?

25:38.995 --> 25:40.622
-Oh...
-[Ray] Um...

25:43.083 --> 25:47.045
[both chanting]
Hey-hey, ho-ho, clear backpacks got to go!

25:47.128 --> 25:49.381
Hey, get together
for the yearbook picture.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.675
[camera shutter clicks]

25:56.930 --> 25:58.056
[sighs]

25:58.682 --> 26:01.685
So, while I was fighting
for my kids' rights to privacy,

26:01.810 --> 26:04.396
[grunts]
you were fighting to take mine away.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.983
-Thanks, bro.
-Anytime, buddy.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.236
-I still can't believe you did this to me.
-[sighs] To you?

26:11.319 --> 26:14.447
-I did all the heavy lifting.
-I was the one under the piano!

26:15.782 --> 26:18.952
The hard part's over,
and now you have an awesome neighbor.

26:19.035 --> 26:22.872
Yeah, a super friendly neighbor
who I also work with.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.918
Dude, I'd rather live next door
to a serial killer.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.671
At least they keep to themselves.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.215
I'm sure you'll barely know she's there.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.593
[warm-up playing on piano]

26:36.970 --> 26:38.430
Who doesn't love the piano?

26:39.848 --> 26:45.770
[Abby singing faintly upstairs,
sings high note]

26:46.855 --> 26:48.023
I see what you're doing.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.358
You're trying to get me
to start drinking again.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.153
No way, bro. I would never do that.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.697
But let me know when Cool Gabe comes back.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.782
[chimes jangling]

26:57.866 --> 26:59.242
Hey, Gabe-bor.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.994
[mouthing silently]

27:02.912 --> 27:05.665
When it comes to chimes, shells or bells?

27:05.749 --> 27:07.751
[chimes jangle loudly]

27:08.960 --> 27:10.670
Bro, please do something about this.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.590
I like shells, personally.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.680
[theme music playing]
