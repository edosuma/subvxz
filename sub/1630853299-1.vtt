-[people cheering]
-[supporter] Let's get it, BB!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.342
-Show some hustle!
-Get the flag!

04:19.425 --> 04:21.427
[grunting]

04:25.765 --> 04:29.352
[Kai] Yo, yo, I'm on your six.
Catch me if you can!

04:36.234 --> 04:39.404
All right, gimme your best bet.
Who do you think is gonna win this?

04:39.487 --> 04:40.488
-[sniffs]
-Huh?

04:40.571 --> 04:44.033
Team BB.
They've won 37 out of 42 of these.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.119
Still, you never really know.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.913
[leader] They're on
the Denki Ninja's home turf.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.207
If they screw up
and fall in an Antlion Pit,

04:51.291 --> 04:52.500
it's game over.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.380
Hey, um…

04:57.463 --> 04:58.548
What is it, newbie?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.509
I'm still not 100 percent
on how all these rules work.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.552
What?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.846
All right, dude, try to keep up.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.473
[Mad Lobster member] Tokyo Battlekour
is a five-on-five game

05:07.557 --> 05:10.810
where teams bet
on the outcome of a parkour match.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.104
You're out if you fall into the ocean.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.648
But the lucky team
that captures the flag, wins.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.819
But, um, isn't going all out like that
kinda dangerous, though?

05:19.902 --> 05:22.030
-[leader] Hell yeah it's dangerous.
-Huh.

05:22.113 --> 05:26.284
All the kids here are just idiots
whose only purpose is to play this game.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.494
[sniffs deeply]

05:29.078 --> 05:30.955
On the other hand, I guess you can argue

05:31.039 --> 05:34.292
that all this brouhaha
keeps Tokyo a safe city.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.794

06:00.318 --> 06:02.612
[Usagi] I hope you like eating my dust,
slowpoke ninja!

06:02.695 --> 06:03.905
Catch ya later!

06:05.073 --> 06:08.785
Jammer! Block Route C.
Stop the short BB kid.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.873
Oh, why thank you.

06:14.665 --> 06:15.792
Where is Hibiki?

06:16.292 --> 06:17.585
Where is he always?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.129
Doing whatever the heck he wants.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.132
Well, Tokyo Battlekour
does value independence.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.177
And that's fine and all,
but this is a five-on-five game.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.096
[Makoto] If one player is missing…

06:28.846 --> 06:29.806
[grunting]

06:29.889 --> 06:31.099
He's cornered at Pitch 14.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.976
These guys just don't know when to quit.
[surprised gasp]

06:35.812 --> 06:38.022
Stray bubble challenge!

06:39.732 --> 06:40.942
Oh! You idiot!

06:53.913 --> 06:54.872
Uh-oh!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.166
[Usagi groaning]

06:59.627 --> 07:01.671
Oh, no! Antlion Pit!

07:01.754 --> 07:03.256
BB fall! We need rescue.

07:04.006 --> 07:04.841
Let's get going.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.425
What? We won't make it. Whoa!

07:07.426 --> 07:09.220
[Usagi groaning]

07:12.765 --> 07:14.183
Oh!

07:14.267 --> 07:16.477
What were you thinking, Usagi?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.396
The problem is, he wasn't thinking.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.107
The only one who can hop
stray bubbles in an away game…

07:21.649 --> 07:23.192
is that guy.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.652
[wind rustling]

07:31.659 --> 07:33.327
[grunting]

07:33.411 --> 07:34.245
[Makoto] Oh!

07:34.328 --> 07:35.163
He's here.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.498
Oh?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.250
-[ethereal chime]
-[deep exhale]

07:40.084 --> 07:41.210
[Usagi] Ah!

07:41.294 --> 07:43.087
-What was that? He's awesome!
-[crowd cheering]

07:52.346 --> 07:53.306
Hey!

07:53.389 --> 07:55.308
Don't leave me here!

-[grunting]

08:44.774 --> 08:46.692
You're kidding! Hell of a route!

08:46.776 --> 08:48.110

-[crowd clamoring in admiration]

[crowd cheering]

09:04.961 --> 09:06.504
Hm?

09:06.587 --> 09:07.505
[Makoto] Whoa!

09:09.674 --> 09:11.467
[crowd chatting excitedly]

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
[disbelieving breath]

09:15.263 --> 09:16.514
[shocked groaning]

09:16.597 --> 09:18.266
[crowd chatting excitedly]

09:20.268 --> 09:22.895
And the winner is, the Blue Blazes!

09:23.479 --> 09:25.898
[supporters] Damn it!
I can't believe they lost!

09:25.982 --> 09:27.858
That was totally mind-blowing.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.611
Oh, shit! Now they're gonna get our rice.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.613
Looks like you guys need more training.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.574
We'll be taking home our gasoline.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.493
[Usagi] Hey, Hibiki!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.205
Why did you leave me there like that?

09:41.289 --> 09:44.375
That jump you did back there.
It just showed off your recklessness.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.794
Uh… But I did it the other day!

09:46.877 --> 09:49.046
-[Hibiki] And it was only by chance.
-Uh…

09:49.630 --> 09:51.090
You need more fear.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.554
[flag clattering]

09:57.430 --> 09:58.639
[Kai hissing]
Bastard!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.520
[grunts]

10:06.731 --> 10:08.482
Come on. Let's do the usual.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.821
[Isozaki] Can't remember the last time
Hibiki joined in in one of these.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.780
[clicks tongue]

10:15.281 --> 10:16.699
With our blue blazes…

10:16.782 --> 10:18.701
[all] We're gonna burn it all down!

10:18.784 --> 10:19.619
Yeah!

10:19.702 --> 10:20.786
[Makoto] Lame.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.497
[sighs]
I'm exhausted.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.000
This game is totally murder to my heart.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.960
Why do they pull all these stunts?

10:28.044 --> 10:30.212
Well, that's the whole reason
we're here, isn't it?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.048
Huh?

10:32.131 --> 10:33.841
-Hey!
-[gasping]

10:33.924 --> 10:35.176
[Shin] That was a good decision,

10:35.259 --> 10:37.261
not to jump the crack
on the Shohei bridge.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.431
-[amazed gasping]
-Thank you, sir!

10:41.015 --> 10:42.725
You keep practicing hard now.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.735
JAPAN COAST GUARD REIYO

10:52.818 --> 10:54.654
[Usagi] All right!

10:54.737 --> 10:56.906
We got a whole
month's worth of rice, everyone!

10:56.989 --> 10:59.742
And what have we here? It's beer, baby!

10:59.825 --> 11:02.411
Yeah, you wish!
Maybe try a juice box, kiddo.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.872
-I'll be taking that, if you don't mind.
-Oh.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.707
-Minor.
-[splashing]

11:11.545 --> 11:14.131
Hey, Makoto, where are you going? Wait!

11:14.215 --> 11:16.175
Let's have a drink together,
what do you say?

11:16.258 --> 11:19.053
Give it up. Clearly, she's not into you.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.305
We're just her research subjects.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.642
He's right, you know.
She's here observing the gravity anomaly.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.976
[grunts]

11:26.060 --> 11:27.603
[rumbling in background]

11:27.686 --> 11:30.147
Oh, sweet! Calling dibs on this snack! Ah!

11:30.231 --> 11:33.067
Hey! Didn't I say
don't open that box without asking?

11:33.150 --> 11:34.318
I give up!

11:34.402 --> 11:35.778
Where the heck are your manners, huh?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.488
Didn't your parents teach you anything?

11:37.571 --> 11:39.115
I didn't have parents!

11:39.198 --> 11:41.742
Just like everyone else here!

11:42.660 --> 11:44.954
[bright music]

11:55.047 --> 11:56.966
-Would you knock it off already?
-Oh!

11:57.049 --> 11:58.134
You startled me!

11:58.217 --> 12:00.302
I guess surprising you is a non-starter.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.470
[chuckles awkwardly]

12:02.221 --> 12:03.264
[sighs]

12:03.347 --> 12:04.849
Why were you even trying to?

12:05.891 --> 12:06.725
-[grunts]
-[Hibiki gasps]

12:06.809 --> 12:08.644
Hey! Give those back! Not cool!

12:09.562 --> 12:10.688
Forget it.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.357
Why do you sulk out here
looking all gloomy?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.401
Give 'em back.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.654
Hm.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.577
So, what was that out there today?

12:24.660 --> 12:25.536
[Hibiki] What do you mean?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.831
[Makoto] The move you rescued Usagi with.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.708
If you had fallen into the Antlion Pit…

12:30.791 --> 12:31.876
[Hibiki] I wouldn't.

12:32.710 --> 12:36.088
[Makoto] Keep up the dangerous moves,
and I'll have to report it to HQ.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.424
Then you'd all be tossed out
on your butts.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.717
Is that what you want?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.891
[Hibiki] I'm going to leave someday.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.310
But I can't right now.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.189
[ship creaking]

13:01.655 --> 13:02.740
I can hear it.

13:02.823 --> 13:03.657
[Makoto] What?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.410
Wait! Hibiki!

13:08.704 --> 13:10.956
-[water splashing]
-[engine revving]

13:14.460 --> 13:15.669
[disappointed sigh]

13:15.753 --> 13:17.755
-[Shin] Got away, huh?
-Huh?

13:18.672 --> 13:20.799
Hey, Shin, get this.

13:20.883 --> 13:24.220
Hibiki said he could hear songs
from the tower again.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.262
Hmm.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.098
[engine revving]

13:38.651 --> 13:39.902
[Makoto] Five years ago…

13:40.486 --> 13:43.155
bubbles fell all over the world.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.115
[distant ticking]

13:49.954 --> 13:52.373
The bubbles had mysterious powers,

13:52.456 --> 13:55.125
and their arrival
brought about pandemonium.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.878
OPERATION TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED

13:57.962 --> 13:59.088
Soon after…

14:00.172 --> 14:02.007
[muffled explosion]

14:06.720 --> 14:11.475
A huge explosion of uncertain origin
occurred in the center of Tokyo.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.813
Tokyo became ground zero,

14:15.896 --> 14:18.440
and was enclosed in a gigantic bubble.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.489
Even after the bubbles
stopped falling elsewhere in the world…

14:25.573 --> 14:29.201
the phenomenon continued
solely in the center of Tokyo.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.707
By the time the accumulated bubbles
surrounding the area

14:34.790 --> 14:36.917
burst and turned into water…

14:37.001 --> 14:39.920
Tokyo was no longer the capital of Japan.

14:44.383 --> 14:48.679
Scientists from across the globe
came to do research in Tokyo,

14:48.762 --> 14:52.850
but none were able to determine the cause
of the Bubble-fall Phenomenon.

14:54.018 --> 14:58.147
Little by little, the people of Tokyo
left their home behind.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.569
It now stands…

15:03.652 --> 15:06.113
as a shell of its former self.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.656
An abandoned city.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.748
DO NOT ENTER

15:15.831 --> 15:18.125
Tokyo became a residents prohibited zone.

15:19.668 --> 15:24.006
Over time,
boys began illegally residing in the area.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.427
They ignored countless orders to leave,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.347
and started participating
in a dangerous game

15:31.430 --> 15:33.933
that made use of the unique environment.

15:37.978 --> 15:42.232
They're orphans who lost their loved ones
due to the Bubble-fall Phenomenon.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.861
One of the boys…

15:45.945 --> 15:50.783
claims he can hear the sound of songs
emanating from the tower.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.092
The cloud that now covers the tower,
the center of the blast,

16:08.175 --> 16:10.469
contains a complex gravity field.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.223
Observations cannot be made
inside of the cloud,

16:14.306 --> 16:16.392
regardless of equipment.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.311
And there are constant
unscientific rumors,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.398
such as that ghosts
exist inside the cloud.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.027
[bubble gasping]

16:27.611 --> 16:29.238
[Hibiki] This is the highest I can reach.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.282
But I need to go further.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.995
I can still hear it.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.872
The sound of the bubbles.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.631
[grunting]

16:50.050 --> 16:51.301
[wind rustling]

16:55.806 --> 16:57.641
[grunting]

16:59.101 --> 17:00.185
[Hibiki] I did it!

17:01.729 --> 17:02.771
Huh?

17:06.650 --> 17:07.526
[shocked breath]

17:08.902 --> 17:10.821
[groaning]

17:15.826 --> 17:17.036
[bubble gasping]

17:18.620 --> 17:19.788
[Hibiki] Spiderweb!

17:20.831 --> 17:22.041
[grunting]

17:22.124 --> 17:23.375
[crackling]

17:24.043 --> 17:25.669
[Hibiki yelping]

17:26.295 --> 17:27.796
[splashing]

17:28.505 --> 17:30.340
[Hibiki gurgling]

17:40.517 --> 17:42.061
[crashing]

17:44.813 --> 17:46.815
[warbled rumbling]

17:48.901 --> 17:50.402
[bubble panting]

17:50.486 --> 17:51.904
[cat hissing]

17:52.821 --> 17:54.490
[bubble panting]

17:56.325 --> 17:59.161
[soft music]

18:09.671 --> 18:11.507
[ethereal ringing]

18:13.258 --> 18:14.676
[bubble gasping]

18:31.443 --> 18:33.695
[music building]

18:37.241 --> 18:38.075
Mer…

18:38.992 --> 18:39.993
maid?

18:41.662 --> 18:43.497
[water bubbling]

19:01.348 --> 19:03.433
[distant bird calls]

19:13.777 --> 19:14.987
[amazed exhale]

19:27.875 --> 19:29.501
-[water bubbling]
-[girl gasps]

19:31.503 --> 19:32.796
[Hibiki] Who… who are you?

19:34.381 --> 19:35.924
[panting]

19:42.222 --> 19:45.767
[Kai] Oh, damn it! Hibiki's late.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.520
Hm?

19:49.938 --> 19:51.398
It's Shin's ship!

19:51.481 --> 19:52.524
[Usagi] Oh!

20:01.491 --> 20:02.910
[all] Who is she?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.204
[Shin] She saved his life.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.413
[Blue Blaze members] Huh?

20:06.496 --> 20:07.664
You heard me.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.125
Hibiki here was about to meet his maker.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.085
But he made it thanks to this one.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.086
-[girl hissing]
-Huh?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.130
From the Antlion Pit?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.423
You've gotta be kidding me?

20:16.506 --> 20:17.382
What the hell!

20:17.466 --> 20:19.968
Where did she even come from anyway?

20:20.052 --> 20:21.470
Have you seen her before?

20:21.553 --> 20:22.429
Uh-uh.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.556
No way you'd forget someone
dressed like that.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.808
-[all exclaiming in surprise]
-[rumbling]

20:27.726 --> 20:29.102
[Kai] How did she get over there?

20:29.186 --> 20:30.687
She moves like a cat.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.648
[Usagi] Ah! She's taking the ramen!

20:32.731 --> 20:35.067
Hey! Don't go through our stuff!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.653
-[Isozaki] She bolted.
-Get back here!

20:37.736 --> 20:39.613
-[Blue Blaze members talking]
-[water boiling]

20:39.696 --> 20:40.530
[exhales in wonder]

20:40.614 --> 20:42.407
-[Usagi] My ramen!
-[Kai] Where'd she go?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.826
I got a few choice words for her.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.120
Ah! Hey, that's scalding!

20:47.204 --> 20:49.039
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.208
[Makoto] We need something cold!

20:53.168 --> 20:55.087
[suspenseful music]

20:59.508 --> 21:01.343
Yep, she's a cat-girl.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.262
[Isozaki] What a stupid thing to do.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.138
-That's cold.
-[Usagi] Why would she do that?

21:05.222 --> 21:06.139
[Isozaki] Who knows?

21:06.974 --> 21:08.100
[Shin] She's like a rabbit, right?

21:08.725 --> 21:11.853
Now, being eccentric
isn't the worst thing.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.524
I'd like her to stay here on the Reiyo,
if we're all cool with that.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.444
She might surprise us by becoming
a capable player in the Battlekour.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.072
-Hibiki.
-Huh?

21:23.240 --> 21:26.118
Play nice now.
And find a way to repay her.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.502
Oh.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.725
You're gonna catch a cold.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.858
[Makoto] What do you think?
Do you like it?

22:01.069 --> 22:02.070
Have a good night.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.660
[Makoto breathing deeply]

22:23.175 --> 22:25.802
[soft distant music]

22:49.993 --> 22:51.578
-[water bubbling]
-[girl gasping]

22:56.792 --> 22:58.001
Hm.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.259
[gentle music]

23:13.767 --> 23:15.393
[birds chirping]

23:17.020 --> 23:18.522
[horn honking]

23:19.231 --> 23:22.109
[Makoto] Good morning!
It's a new day, filled with hope.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.528
Up and at 'em. Go Blue Blazes!

23:25.112 --> 23:26.279
[grunting]

23:26.988 --> 23:28.490
[yawning]

23:29.908 --> 23:31.827
[grunting]

23:35.122 --> 23:36.498
-Huh?
-Huh?

23:37.415 --> 23:38.500
[bird squawking]

23:40.627 --> 23:43.505
-[grunting]
-[footsteps approaching]

23:45.340 --> 23:47.467
Hibiki, that girl's waiting for ya.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.513
[Usagi] Solo training is cool and all,

23:51.596 --> 23:53.723
but you should come
to the deck sometimes, too.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.060
[Kai] Oh, he emerges at last.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.438
[girl giggles softly]

24:06.111 --> 24:07.279
Hm?

24:10.365 --> 24:12.659
-[grunts]
-Hey, you!

24:15.078 --> 24:17.414
-[bird squawking]
-Huh?

24:18.456 --> 24:20.208
-[Hibiki] Oh.
-[headphones clattering]

24:20.292 --> 24:21.751
[birds chirping]

24:24.963 --> 24:25.922
[soft grunt]

24:26.006 --> 24:29.050
[girl harmonizing a soft tune]

24:41.563 --> 24:44.441
-[splashing]
-[squawking]

24:50.071 --> 24:51.406
[grunts]

24:52.908 --> 24:54.242
[gasps in amazement]

25:03.001 --> 25:04.502
[giggles]

25:05.629 --> 25:07.088
[chickens squawking]

25:08.673 --> 25:11.426
That weird looking girl
is actually pretty amazing.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.303
[Usagi] She might do great
in a parkour game.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.681
[Isozaki] Hibiki is basically the reason
we keep winning.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.228
We certainly could do with a talented
new team member, right boss?

25:21.311 --> 25:23.063
What do you mean he's the reason?

25:23.813 --> 25:27.901
As if. None of you understands
what it means to be a team player.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.028
-[chickens squawking]
-Hm?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.534
Wha… what are you do…

25:37.118 --> 25:38.954
-Hm?
-[crashes]

25:40.205 --> 25:41.122
[chuckles]

25:44.042 --> 25:46.336
-[chickens squawking]
-[girl hisses]

25:47.087 --> 25:48.630
What is wrong with you? Knock it off?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.507
[Makoto] Watch out!

25:50.590 --> 25:51.633
Huh?

25:52.342 --> 25:53.385
[Hibiki groans]

25:54.010 --> 25:55.178
GALE IMPACT
USAGI

25:55.262 --> 25:56.846
[Blue Blaze team] Let's dig in!

25:58.473 --> 26:02.477
[Usagi] Wow, this must be a special feast,
even Hibiki's decided to join.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.605
-What happened to your cheek, man?
-[grumbles]

26:06.982 --> 26:09.484
[Kai] Might need a bit more training.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.822
Just so you know,
I'd never let a hen get the drop on me.

26:13.905 --> 26:14.739
That's nice.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.826
I even know how to operate the rail.
Not to brag.

26:17.909 --> 26:18.868
Riveting.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.705
By the way, have you seen
how much this girl eats?

26:22.998 --> 26:25.000
[Makoto] Okay, you're gonna
have to shoot for this one.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.376
[Usagi and Kai] Huh?

26:26.459 --> 26:29.004
-[Kai] Seriously?
-[Usagi] But, I…

26:30.046 --> 26:31.298
[Hibiki] All right.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.552
This is one of the eggs
you mercilessly crushed earlier.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.220
Don't ever do that again, got it?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.305
[Usagi] Okay, who's next?

26:39.931 --> 26:41.099
-[Isozaki] Cool.
-[Osawa] Let's do it!

26:41.182 --> 26:42.017
[Usagi] Here we go!

26:42.100 --> 26:43.893
[Blue Blaze members]
Rock, paper, scissors!

26:43.977 --> 26:45.687
[Osawa] Again!

26:45.770 --> 26:47.939
Let's go again!

26:48.023 --> 26:49.190
You're a strange one.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.442
[Usagi] Let's go again!

26:50.525 --> 26:52.819
[Makoto] So, what's her name?

26:52.902 --> 26:53.903
I dunno.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.363
[Makoto] Didn't she save your life?

26:55.447 --> 26:58.742
Rock, paper, scissors, let's go again!

26:58.825 --> 27:00.910
Yeah! I win!

27:00.994 --> 27:03.496
"Uta," then. On account of the singing.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.457
You didn't put a lot of thought into it.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.625
So, who was singing?

27:07.709 --> 27:08.877
She was?

27:12.380 --> 27:14.215
-Uta.
-Hm?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.010
-Hibiki.
-Hm.

27:20.013 --> 27:20.930
[Hibiki] Uta.

27:25.143 --> 27:26.102
Hibiki.

27:27.145 --> 27:27.979
Uta.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.523
Uta.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.652
Look at that. I guess the name's a winner.

27:34.736 --> 27:37.822
Since it's been decided,
nice to meet you, Uta.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.575
[bright chuckle]

27:42.786 --> 27:44.704
UTA

27:55.465 --> 27:56.591
[Makoto] Let's see…

27:56.674 --> 27:59.594
"Mobile areas
from last gravity field shift."

27:59.677 --> 28:01.888
"No observable changes at this point."

28:03.139 --> 28:07.018
And it doesn't look like any other
periodic laws have changed either.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.397
Next rationing arrangements
are on schedule.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.943
We're all good. Okay. All done!

28:15.026 --> 28:16.069
Hey, got a sec?

28:16.152 --> 28:17.362
Oh. Uh…

28:18.071 --> 28:20.281
Shin! I… wasn't expecting you.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.950
Uhm…
[clears throat]

28:22.033 --> 28:23.284
Please, have a seat.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.375
How is she?

28:30.458 --> 28:31.918
[Makoto] Oh, she's doing great.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.171
Hibiki ended up giving her the name Uta.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.923
She's really taken a liking to him.

28:37.006 --> 28:40.927
Has she? Maybe she'll take
to parkour just as quickly.

28:41.970 --> 28:42.804
Have a drink.

28:56.317 --> 29:00.029
[Makoto] Shin, aren't you
interested in parkour anymore?

29:00.113 --> 29:01.698
[chuckles]
I'm too old.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.117
Besides, even if I wasn't…

29:04.909 --> 29:06.661
I have this now.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.708
That's from your tower run. Am I right?

29:12.333 --> 29:16.254
I was rash and it cost me.
So now I stick around to keep them safe.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.883
Like Hibiki, I survived a tower accident.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.807
We should just
stop these games altogether.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.225
[Makoto] It's too dangerous.

29:29.309 --> 29:33.146
Frankly speaking, we're not supposed to
let them be here in the first place.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.147
[chuckles]

29:34.230 --> 29:37.233
Well, they are doing it all
at their own risk.

29:38.234 --> 29:42.071
The world outside of here
is just too suffocating for them.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.492
[engine humming]

29:57.629 --> 29:59.130
[drone humming]

30:05.470 --> 30:06.679
[mechanical whirring]

30:07.806 --> 30:09.432
What the hell was that?

30:09.516 --> 30:11.059
[grunting]

30:11.142 --> 30:12.560
[Kai] Morticians…

30:12.644 --> 30:16.231
Guess they started using some sort
of contraption since we last saw them.

30:16.314 --> 30:20.193
But that can't be fair, can it?
The Mad Lobsters don't really have a shot!

30:20.693 --> 30:23.947
Don't count them out yet.
They should be the team with more power.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.615
[panting]

30:26.199 --> 30:27.325
[grunting]

30:28.785 --> 30:29.786
[mechanical whirring]

30:30.286 --> 30:31.871
Whoa!
[grunting]

30:35.750 --> 30:38.169
[Under Taker member]
R-5, move to Point N2.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.675
[panting]

30:43.758 --> 30:45.844
-[determined grunt]
-[shattering]

30:45.927 --> 30:47.428
[audience cheering]

30:48.972 --> 30:51.140
-[mechanical whirring]
-[Blue Blaze gasping]

30:53.893 --> 30:56.229
[audience clamoring]

31:02.402 --> 31:03.736
[Shin] Game set!

31:03.820 --> 31:07.407
The winner of the match is,
The Under Takers!

31:11.494 --> 31:13.663
We haven't lost yet, damn Morticians!

31:13.746 --> 31:15.874
Actually, you did lose.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.084
[Mad Lobster leader] Screw those
stupid boots of yours!

31:18.918 --> 31:22.463
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't quite catch that, Team Crawfish.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.673
[grumbles angrily]

31:23.756 --> 31:25.466
We're the Mad Lobsters!

31:26.092 --> 31:28.803
My apologies, Team Hermit Crab.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.430
[leader] I said, "We're Lobsters!"

31:31.639 --> 31:33.516
[boat engine whirring]

31:40.607 --> 31:43.276
Let's see,
which one should I choose for tonight…

31:59.500 --> 32:00.627
[Makoto] The Little Mermaid.

32:02.086 --> 32:05.089
It's a pretty sad story,
so it's not my favorite.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.508
Why does the Little Mermaid,
who rescued the prince,

32:07.592 --> 32:09.344
have to dissolve into foam anyway?

32:10.345 --> 32:12.513
Oops, was that a spoiler?

32:14.349 --> 32:16.601
-So, do you wanna read it?
-[Uta] Hm.

32:18.519 --> 32:20.897
It's getting late, so just one story.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.196
"Deep under the sea,
on the bottom of the ocean,

32:28.279 --> 32:30.198
was a kingdom of mermaids.

32:31.532 --> 32:36.204
Their ruler, the mermaid king,
lived in a castle with his people."

32:38.122 --> 32:41.834
[Makoto] "The youngest of the mermaids
possessed a truly beautiful,

32:41.918 --> 32:43.878
crystal clear voice.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.925
However, this young soul was also consumed

32:49.425 --> 32:52.136
by an obsession with the world of humans."

32:54.639 --> 32:56.933
"When she found her way to the surface,

32:57.016 --> 33:00.937
the Little Mermaid's vision
was captivated by a prince on the ship.

33:01.020 --> 33:03.606
She became entranced by him."

33:05.400 --> 33:09.696
"The Little Mermaid couldn't take her eyes
off of her newfound prince.

33:10.530 --> 33:14.867
It was as if she was madly,
deliriously in love with him."

33:16.035 --> 33:17.453
[yelps]
When did you get here?

33:19.497 --> 33:20.915
You're the prince.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.795
I'm the Little Mermaid.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.176
[gasps]

33:32.260 --> 33:33.302
[shocked mumble]

33:34.429 --> 33:35.471
[Hibiki] No way.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.267
Hibiki. You're the prince.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.728
[Hibiki] No, you've got it all wrong.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.688
[Uta] Uta. Little Mermaid.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.482
Hey, never mind that.
Did you speak just now?

33:49.736 --> 33:51.320
[anxious muttering]

33:54.323 --> 33:55.533
[gasping]

33:57.994 --> 33:59.996
[gentle sweet music]

34:06.044 --> 34:07.045
[giggles softly]

34:19.432 --> 34:20.475
[splashing]

34:21.184 --> 34:22.685
Whoa! She's awesome!

34:29.692 --> 34:31.486
[Under Taker leader] They will be next.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.280
PIGEONS AND SANDGROUSE

34:34.363 --> 34:35.573
PARROTS

34:37.909 --> 34:41.829
THE ENVIRONMENT, PARROTS, SPACE

34:44.707 --> 34:45.708
Oh.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.835
-Hey, check it out.
-Huh?

34:47.919 --> 34:50.338
Pull up with your underarm muscles.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.803
Looking good.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.554
Those two might make a good team.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.265
Can we hurry up and finish here?

35:02.433 --> 35:03.935
[ethereal whooshing]

35:08.189 --> 35:11.025
[gentle sweet music]

35:21.994 --> 35:23.538
[blowing]

35:31.045 --> 35:33.881
[uplifting orchestral music]

35:56.195 --> 35:57.738
[splashing]

36:04.620 --> 36:06.080
[gasps]

36:12.753 --> 36:17.341
[Makoto] It's said that the world
repeatedly collapses and rebuilds.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.221
Assembles. Bursts.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.850
Scatters. Then, assembles again.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.733
Our Milky Way galaxy.

36:34.775 --> 36:39.822
It'll collide with Andromeda
in about 4.5 billion years.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.285
Then it will burst.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.494
And once again…

36:45.578 --> 36:47.496
It's going to scatter apart?

36:47.580 --> 36:48.748
Bingo.

36:48.831 --> 36:51.667
[Makoto] And the elements
which make up our bodies,

36:51.751 --> 36:56.005
will again come together,
to become materials for another star.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.423
Huh. Gotcha.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.301
Vortex.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.345
[Makoto] Yes. Vortex.

37:02.887 --> 37:07.558
The vortex appears in galaxies, typhoons
and biomolecule structures.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.477
It's a pattern of life.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.812
[whirring]

37:17.944 --> 37:19.028
Vortex.

37:20.905 --> 37:21.864
It came together…

37:23.241 --> 37:24.325
burst…

37:31.832 --> 37:33.834
And a lot of people died.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.712
[Makoto] Uta! Where are you?

38:18.629 --> 38:21.299
Hey, Usagi,
do you have any idea where Uta went?

38:21.382 --> 38:24.885
I don't know.
She's probably with Hibiki, though.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.721
-[aggressive clucking]
-[yelps]

38:28.180 --> 38:30.683
I swear, they're just like
a hen and her chick.

38:34.312 --> 38:38.441
What a joke. How could anyone
get attached to someone like that?

38:41.861 --> 38:43.779
[birds chirping]

38:46.866 --> 38:50.619
[water flowing softly]

38:55.249 --> 38:56.292
[gasps]

39:00.046 --> 39:01.047
[giggles]

39:04.884 --> 39:06.093
[sighs]

39:10.639 --> 39:13.392
[Hibiki] You mind not telling anyone
about this place?

39:14.060 --> 39:15.853
'Cause they'll just laugh at me.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.105
Flower.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.317
That's right.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.402
Beautiful.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.321
It's a secret.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.077
Secret.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.677
Oh.

40:06.904 --> 40:07.947
[sniffs]

40:08.030 --> 40:09.448
[slurps]

40:10.699 --> 40:11.826
[gagging]

40:13.035 --> 40:14.286
Hmm.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.291
Huh?

40:19.375 --> 40:20.709
[happy sigh]

40:21.419 --> 40:22.253
[Hibiki] Oh.

40:24.797 --> 40:27.299
One day it randomly washed up.

40:28.968 --> 40:30.302
Seashells are rare here.

40:32.179 --> 40:35.683
So can you hear their sound too?
The sound of waves.

40:35.766 --> 40:36.851
Hm.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.854
[birds chirping]

40:41.355 --> 40:42.773
[sighs]

40:50.823 --> 40:52.741
[water lapping]

41:04.128 --> 41:05.296
The sounds here…

41:06.046 --> 41:07.673
they're always so peaceful.

41:19.351 --> 41:20.769
To tell the truth…

41:21.687 --> 41:22.771
since way back…

41:23.898 --> 41:26.192
I've been scared of all the city noise.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.196
I couldn't understand
how anyone could bear it.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.451
I was like this all the time back then.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.037
And it worried my mother.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.915
-[train rumbling]
-[warning light beeping]

41:43.667 --> 41:46.337
-[cars honking]
-[bell ringing]

41:53.802 --> 41:56.096
[soft gentle music]

41:58.724 --> 42:01.644
FOR AUDITORY HYPERSENSITIVITY

42:09.735 --> 42:12.363
[Hibiki] I had to go see lots of doctors.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.449
I wanted to try my best to get better.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.954
[soft emotional music]

42:52.361 --> 42:54.822
When the bubbles fell,

42:54.905 --> 42:57.157
I was at the tower
with kids from the center.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.382
There was an explosion.

43:14.216 --> 43:16.468
And when I came to,
I had already been rescued.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.348
My memory about it is foggy at best.

43:22.641 --> 43:23.809
I do recall…

43:24.727 --> 43:26.687
that I heard something.

43:27.521 --> 43:29.440
-A song.
-[gasps]

43:30.566 --> 43:33.193
[high-pitched melody]

43:35.821 --> 43:39.241
I don't wanna hate hearing sounds.

43:40.659 --> 43:43.245
To be honest,
that's what I'm searching for.

43:43.829 --> 43:44.872
That one sound.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.462
[sighs]

43:52.546 --> 43:55.215
I've never told anyone
this much about myself.

43:59.428 --> 44:00.596
[soft breath]

44:18.822 --> 44:22.826
[Uta singing soft melody]

44:33.837 --> 44:35.714
[continues singing soft melody]

44:53.941 --> 44:54.775
Uta…

44:55.984 --> 44:59.154
[Uta singing melody]

45:19.550 --> 45:23.220
[Uta's vocal intensifies]

45:50.164 --> 45:51.165
[gasps]

46:06.346 --> 46:07.306
Uta?

46:08.182 --> 46:11.018
[high-pitched melody]

46:30.412 --> 46:33.540
-[whirring]
-[whooshing]

46:54.603 --> 46:56.188
[Makoto] Hmm. This is strange.

46:56.813 --> 46:57.981
The Gravitational Waves

46:58.565 --> 47:00.901
appear to have been unstable
for quite a while.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.278
When did this start?

47:03.362 --> 47:04.279
Huh?

47:05.405 --> 47:07.199
Isn't that the day that Uta arrived?

47:08.075 --> 47:09.243
[yelps]

47:09.326 --> 47:10.202
[groans]

47:11.286 --> 47:13.121
-Good morning to you.
-[gasps]

47:13.205 --> 47:14.373
[gasping]

47:14.456 --> 47:19.711
Good morning to you.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.341
[Hibiki] They kidnapped Makoto?

47:24.925 --> 47:25.801
Yeah, look.

47:26.885 --> 47:30.681
[Makoto] Hey, knock it off! Stop it!
What are you doing to me?

47:30.764 --> 47:32.015
Let me go!

47:32.099 --> 47:33.058
[yelps]

47:34.309 --> 47:35.561
What the hell is this about?

47:36.603 --> 47:37.813
This was left behind.

47:41.316 --> 47:42.693
SPECIAL PRIZE… MAKOTO!

47:42.776 --> 47:45.153
[Kai] Those damn Morticians!

47:45.237 --> 47:48.865
If they wanna live, they better not
be doing any pervy shit to her!

47:48.949 --> 47:49.992
Say what?

47:50.075 --> 47:51.994
They've been live streaming
the Battlekour matches

47:52.077 --> 47:53.328
to the outside world.

47:53.829 --> 47:56.415
Apparently they've been calling it
"The Tokyo Death Game."

47:56.498 --> 47:59.418
[Usagi] The boots they were wearing
were given to them by a sponsor.

47:59.501 --> 48:02.629
So they kidnapped her just to
up their view count?

48:02.713 --> 48:05.507
[Kai] I'll crush those creeps!
I'll kill 'em!

48:06.216 --> 48:07.926
-How lame.
-Huh?

48:14.308 --> 48:15.601
[all gasping]

48:17.519 --> 48:18.353
Uta?

48:20.981 --> 48:22.107
Hibiki.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.359
I'll crush 'em.

48:24.443 --> 48:25.694
[gasps]

48:27.988 --> 48:29.823
-Let's go.
-[amazed sighs]

48:34.036 --> 48:35.996
This is Uta's first battle.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.457
[engine humming]

48:50.093 --> 48:51.553
Hey! Over there!

48:51.637 --> 48:53.555
Look at that! Below the flag!

48:53.639 --> 48:55.098
There's someone up there!

48:55.182 --> 48:56.475
[Makoto] This isn't funny!

48:56.558 --> 48:58.435
Seriously, you big jerks!

48:58.518 --> 49:00.270
Oh!
[whimpering]

49:01.146 --> 49:03.065
This sucks!

49:03.148 --> 49:06.902
Somebody! Help me!

49:08.195 --> 49:09.905
Hm.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.376
[crows cawing]

49:28.256 --> 49:32.969
Who do these damn punks think they are
using Makoto as some kind of war trophy?

49:36.848 --> 49:38.600
What do those Morticians want?

49:38.684 --> 49:40.602
They're gunning for Team BB's boat.

49:40.686 --> 49:42.813
The Reiyo? And they agreed?

49:42.896 --> 49:45.273
-But, what happens if they lose?
-Hmm…

49:45.816 --> 49:47.609
We'll know soon enough
if it was a good idea

49:47.693 --> 49:50.779
for them to respond
to the Morticians challenge.

49:51.822 --> 49:55.242
We need to avoid direct fighting.
Let's focus on speed.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.536
Isozaki, Usagi, play decoy.

49:57.619 --> 49:59.287
And I'll go after the flag.

49:59.371 --> 50:01.540
-Hibiki, you're with Uta.
-Hm.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.585
Your job is to confuse the enemy.

50:05.669 --> 50:06.545
[Hibiki] Got it.

50:07.879 --> 50:09.089
[drone whirring]

50:14.803 --> 50:16.263
[growling]
Bastards!

50:17.264 --> 50:18.598
You can stream all you want!

50:18.682 --> 50:22.102
Only thing you're gonna see is playback
of how pathetic you all are on loop!

50:22.978 --> 50:25.480
Our views are sure to increase
during this month,

50:25.564 --> 50:27.524
directly increasing
our financial gains as well.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.109
[grumbles]

50:30.819 --> 50:34.531
[Shin] The Blue Blazes
versus The Under Takers.

50:37.409 --> 50:40.328
Ready… set…

50:45.041 --> 50:46.418
-Go!
-[shot ringing]

50:46.501 --> 50:48.378
[grunting]

50:53.008 --> 50:54.426
[mechanical whirring]

50:55.969 --> 50:58.555
[Kai] Damn it! How is that even allowed?

51:00.515 --> 51:04.269
[Under Taker leader] Now, utilize line
formation from Point Alpha to Delta.

51:04.352 --> 51:05.312
[Under Taker members] Roger!

51:05.395 --> 51:07.481
-[mechanical whirring]
-[gasps]

51:07.564 --> 51:09.566
[Isozaki panting and grunting]

[Usagi groans]

51:27.000 --> 51:29.503
[rumbling]

51:30.170 --> 51:31.713
[panting]
This way!

51:32.798 --> 51:34.716
[splashing]

51:35.592 --> 51:37.844
[Under Taker member]
Number four and five, clear.

51:38.428 --> 51:39.888
Damn those Morticians!

51:41.515 --> 51:44.017
[Shin] Team BB fall.
Three players remaining!

51:44.810 --> 51:47.437
Did I hear him right?
We've lost two already?

51:48.396 --> 51:50.482
[Mad Lobster leader]
Leave the kids to us, Team BB.

51:50.565 --> 51:52.776
You guys have to take that flag.

51:52.859 --> 51:54.903
[crows screeching]

51:55.946 --> 51:57.489
[drone whirring]

51:58.406 --> 52:00.742
[Under Taker leader]
Lead our opponents to Point Sigma.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.077
[Under Taker member] Roger!

52:05.413 --> 52:07.541
[fast-paced suspenseful music]

52:08.834 --> 52:10.210
[grunting]

52:11.586 --> 52:13.255

-[all panting]
-[rumbling]

52:27.435 --> 52:28.603
[Kai yelping]

52:32.023 --> 52:33.400
Oh!

52:34.025 --> 52:35.402
Damn it.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.238
[Kai] We're being lured in!

52:43.243 --> 52:46.872
[Under Taker leader] And now,
I must bid you farewell.

52:48.039 --> 52:49.165
Damn it all!

52:49.249 --> 52:50.083
[Kai] Wait, Hibiki!

52:50.667 --> 52:53.628
Jump here,
and you'll be sucked into the Antlion Pit!

52:54.462 --> 52:56.172
Do that and you play
right into their hands.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.217
[splashing]

53:02.137 --> 53:04.180
They play dirty.

53:04.764 --> 53:08.268
They led us to a place where
it's impossible to jump without gear.

53:08.977 --> 53:11.897
We don't have the tools
to jump over this vortex.

53:11.980 --> 53:15.859
Their lead will grow even larger
if we don't think of something right now!

Can you believe it? We came back
from the brink and actually won!

58:11.321 --> 58:13.406

REIYO

58:39.140 --> 58:41.893
Today, Team Blue Blazes
scorched the Morticians!

58:41.976 --> 58:45.021
Those no-good bastards were no match
for our blue flames!

58:45.104 --> 58:48.399
What's more, we were able to rescue Makoto
without so much as a scratch.

58:48.483 --> 58:50.068
-So give it up!
-[applause]

58:50.151 --> 58:51.903
So sorry to worry you, everyone.

and ready for business.

58:54.030 --> 58:54.948
Welcome back.

58:55.031 --> 58:58.117
Right then, to all you lovable idiots,

58:58.201 --> 59:00.578
I would like to wish you
nothing but the best of luck

59:00.662 --> 59:02.914

59:18.054 --> 59:20.765
-Wow.
-Dude, that was so cool!

59:21.558 --> 59:24.477
This is to stop them
from doing anything stupid again.

59:24.561 --> 59:26.729
-[sniffs deeply]
-I'm sure that thing smells good,

59:26.813 --> 59:29.482
but could you maybe try to
lay off the sniffing when you're speaking?

59:29.566 --> 59:31.317
Show my scented squishy a little respect.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.028
[Kai] With our blue blazes…

59:34.112 --> 59:35.947
[all] We're gonna burn it all down!

Yeah!

59:36.948 --> 59:38.157
You were late, you dumbass.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.576
How was I supposed to know?

59:39.659 --> 59:42.495
He's right though!
You're the only one out of sync!

59:42.579 --> 59:43.413
Oh.

59:44.789 --> 59:47.875
[Usagi] Oh, Hibiki. Are we being too loud?

59:49.002 --> 59:50.461
You're just as loud as always.

59:53.339 --> 59:54.716
[Kai] Huh?

59:55.925 --> 59:56.968
[slurping]

59:59.971 --> 1:00:03.516
We won because…
everybody in this room gave it their all.

1:00:08.980 --> 1:00:09.981
Appreciate it.

1:00:14.902 --> 1:00:17.280
Did Hibiki… just thank us?

1:00:17.363 --> 1:00:20.074
Are you feeling all right, dude?
Did you bang your head?

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:22.744
[cooing]
You're so cute!

1:00:22.827 --> 1:00:24.370
[Makoto humming contently]

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:26.205
Hey, you! That is so not fair!

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:28.416
Huh? Would you get out of here?

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:31.878
[chuckles, sniffs deeply]

1:00:31.961 --> 1:00:33.838
-I said stop that.

1:00:35.923 --> 1:00:37.216
-Huh?
-Hm?

1:00:38.176 --> 1:00:39.677
[guests chatting happily]

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:42.597
Hey, what's the matter?

1:00:46.726 --> 1:00:49.395
[water dripping]

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:46.911
[Uta] "They wanted
the Little Mermaid to return home.

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:53.459
They told her…

1:01:54.669 --> 1:01:56.671
You must return to the ocean.

1:01:58.214 --> 1:01:59.298
Please, hurry.

1:02:00.842 --> 1:02:01.968
If you do not return…

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:04.137
then you will…"

-[Hibiki] Uta!
-[Uta gasps]

1:02:31.539 --> 1:02:33.207
Thought this is where you'd be.

1:02:46.387 --> 1:02:48.347
Got something for you.

1:02:54.479 --> 1:02:56.564
[Hibiki] To commemorate
your first victory.

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:16.501
That way, you can always
listen to the sound of the waves.

1:03:19.086 --> 1:03:20.171
[chuckles softly]

1:03:25.426 --> 1:03:27.845
Today I realized something.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.349
How should I say it?

1:03:32.517 --> 1:03:37.021
The person that I thought I was before,
wasn't really me.

1:03:39.273 --> 1:03:41.234
After meeting you, I…

1:03:41.317 --> 1:03:43.986
became myself for the very first time.

1:03:46.364 --> 1:03:48.825
It's all because of you.

1:03:51.786 --> 1:03:52.745
Thank you.

1:03:55.665 --> 1:03:58.543
[soft sweet music]

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:22.191
Uta…

1:04:23.693 --> 1:04:24.861

1:04:37.331 --> 1:04:39.000
[ominous humming]

1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:45.715
These bubbles…

1:04:52.513 --> 1:04:55.057
What's going on?
The way those bubbles are falling…

1:04:58.936 --> 1:04:59.937
[gasps]

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:08.446
It's the same as five years ago!

1:05:10.406 --> 1:05:11.824
[all gasping in shock]

1:05:12.992 --> 1:05:15.161
[Makoto] A second Bubble-fall Phenomenon!

1:05:17.538 --> 1:05:19.749
We must leave Tokyo right away!

1:05:19.832 --> 1:05:22.084
But Hibiki and Uta haven't come back yet!

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:25.254
Those two better not be there…

Uta!

1:05:41.771 --> 1:05:42.855
[Hibiki] What's happening?

1:05:45.483 --> 1:05:47.276
[high-pitched ringing]

[Uta singing melody]

1:06:13.344 --> 1:06:14.679
Huh?

1:06:16.764 --> 1:06:17.682
[girl] Bubbles!

1:06:17.765 --> 1:06:18.724
[man] What?

1:06:18.808 --> 1:06:20.726
What in the world?

1:06:20.810 --> 1:06:23.145
[Uta singing melody]

1:06:29.777 --> 1:06:31.696
Wait, this song…

1:06:31.779 --> 1:06:32.613
it's you?

1:06:37.284 --> 1:06:38.327
[Uta] "The Little Mermaid…

1:06:39.578 --> 1:06:42.123
wanted to see the prince…

1:06:43.666 --> 1:06:46.002
so she floated
to the surface of the ocean."

1:06:49.338 --> 1:06:51.257
It was you all along.

1:06:52.383 --> 1:06:53.759
[chuckles softly]

1:06:53.843 --> 1:06:54.927
[gasps]

1:06:59.432 --> 1:07:00.558
What was that?

1:07:04.395 --> 1:07:09.150
"The Little Mermaid's heart
was about to burst into pieces."

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:11.652
[rumbling]

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:16.115
[Uta] "It was the very last day…

1:07:17.450 --> 1:07:19.618
that she would have to see the prince."

1:07:20.745 --> 1:07:23.164
Are you saying… today is the last day?

1:07:27.710 --> 1:07:28.794
[Uta] They're calling.

1:07:29.670 --> 1:07:31.172
I must stop them.

1:07:32.506 --> 1:07:33.632
[Hibiki] Uta!

1:07:34.675 --> 1:07:35.968

1:07:48.606 --> 1:07:49.982
[boat horn honking]

1:07:56.781 --> 1:07:57.782
The Reiyo?

1:07:58.365 --> 1:07:59.492
Hold onto this!

1:08:01.118 --> 1:08:02.953
[Hibiki panting]

1:08:16.050 --> 1:08:17.593
[electricity crackling]

1:08:34.443 --> 1:08:35.569
Opened up to 13!

1:08:36.153 --> 1:08:38.739
It's turned to auto.
Is it okay to leave it now?

1:08:38.823 --> 1:08:40.950
It's fine! Get back here!

1:08:41.033 --> 1:08:42.868

1:08:43.994 --> 1:08:45.788
[both panting]

1:08:45.871 --> 1:08:47.498
[Isozaki] Tokyo is sinking!

1:08:50.292 --> 1:08:51.836
[Denki Ninja member] This is bad.

1:08:51.919 --> 1:08:54.255
[Mad Lobster member]
You guys should know, I can't swim.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:57.508
As if they're being called by… the tower.

1:08:58.676 --> 1:08:59.593
[Shin] He's back!

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.347
So, this boat can move?

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.850
What? Did you think I was doing
all that maintenance for my health?

1:09:06.809 --> 1:09:09.937
We happened to pick up
some drifting Morticians by the way.

1:09:10.020 --> 1:09:12.231
[gasps]
Starboard!

1:09:12.314 --> 1:09:14.316
[Kai] 20 degrees!

1:09:18.070 --> 1:09:19.864
The water level just keeps rising!

1:09:19.947 --> 1:09:21.323
[Shin] The rescue request?

1:09:21.407 --> 1:09:23.367
I sent it, along with data, to HQ.

1:09:26.537 --> 1:09:28.539
[Makoto] The changes started
when Uta came to the Reiyo.

1:09:33.002 --> 1:09:35.171
A song that only Hibiki and Uta can hear?

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:38.340
Are they hearing the same song?

1:09:39.758 --> 1:09:42.428
The tower must be the source.

1:09:45.764 --> 1:09:49.101
But if I tell him,
Hibiki will wanna go to the tower!

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:52.062

-[Isozaki] Yeah.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.118
[Kai] Damn it! We're stuck!

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:56.043
[Isozaki] Where are you going, Hibiki?

1:10:56.126 --> 1:10:57.920
-To the tower.
-[Usagi] Huh?

1:10:58.003 --> 1:10:59.588
You wanna run that by us again?

1:11:00.297 --> 1:11:01.298
[Hibiki] I'm going to the tower.

1:11:02.258 --> 1:11:03.884
I know Uta's there.

1:11:03.968 --> 1:11:04.802
So I'm going.

1:11:04.885 --> 1:11:07.096
What? Are you trying to die?

1:11:08.138 --> 1:11:10.140
It's too risky. Don't do it!

1:11:10.224 --> 1:11:11.558
[Hibiki] I don't have any choice.

1:11:11.642 --> 1:11:13.435
The bubbles are in an active phase!

1:11:13.519 --> 1:11:15.980
This is serious, man.
Are you really going out there?

1:11:17.773 --> 1:11:18.607
I am.

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:21.819
And you're absolutely sure
Uta will be there?

1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:25.197
Yes. Can you come with me?

1:11:27.241 --> 1:11:28.659
[grumbles]

1:11:32.538 --> 1:11:34.873
Fine, I'll come. But just this once.

1:11:34.957 --> 1:11:37.751
Huh? What are you talking about, Kai?

1:11:37.835 --> 1:11:38.794
[Kai] Let's go!

1:11:38.877 --> 1:11:40.087
[Usagi] Wait, you can't go out there!

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:42.923
What the? You too?

1:11:43.841 --> 1:11:46.885
Of course we're going.
BB's star player needs back-up.

1:11:46.969 --> 1:11:48.679
Uta is also an asset for the team.

1:11:48.762 --> 1:11:50.806
[stammering for words]

1:11:50.889 --> 1:11:51.807
[Osawa] Here.

1:11:52.891 --> 1:11:53.934
[grumbles]

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:56.937
I wish I had parents
who'd talk me out of things like this!

1:11:58.022 --> 1:11:59.398
Hey! You guys get back here!

1:11:59.481 --> 1:12:01.942
[Makoto] Shin, please!
We have to let them go.

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:06.447
There's something about the tower
only Hibiki and Uta know.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:08.657
The kids already
have a feeling about that.

1:12:09.199 --> 1:12:12.953
You said Tokyo Battlekour
values independence, right?

1:12:23.130 --> 1:12:24.590
Would you like to purchase these?

1:12:28.010 --> 1:12:30.387
-[rumbling]
-[thundering]

1:12:33.599 --> 1:12:35.434
[Kai] Okay. Let's do it.

1:12:40.022 --> 1:12:42.399
Yo, Hibiki, get in on this!

1:12:43.317 --> 1:12:44.985
[wind whooshing]

1:12:47.237 --> 1:12:48.447
[sighs]

1:12:53.660 --> 1:12:55.245
With our blue blazes…

1:12:55.329 --> 1:12:56.830
[all] We're gonna burn it all down!

1:12:56.914 --> 1:12:58.040
Yeah!

1:12:58.123 --> 1:13:00.042
[boat horn honking]

1:13:13.472 --> 1:13:15.557
[Kai] Well, that doesn't look too good.

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:18.602
[Hibiki] The red bubbles are dangerous.
Don't let them touch you.

1:13:18.685 --> 1:13:19.770
[Isozaki] Seriously?

1:13:19.853 --> 1:13:21.897
[Kai] This isn't our usual game.

1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:24.149
Keep your guard up. Stay alert!

1:13:24.233 --> 1:13:25.651
[Usagi] Copy that!

1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:28.237
All right, get ready…

1:13:29.363 --> 1:13:30.239
[Kai] Set…

1:13:31.990 --> 1:13:32.866
Go!

1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.369
[all grunting]

1:13:38.163 --> 1:13:40.374
[deep ominous music]

1:13:48.257 --> 1:13:49.591
Good luck to you all.

1:13:53.178 --> 1:13:55.097
-[boots blasting]
-[Usagi yelping]

1:14:01.311 --> 1:14:02.813
[Usagi chuckles]

1:14:02.896 --> 1:14:04.606
Oh, these boots are awesome!

1:14:05.232 --> 1:14:06.900
This ain't the time to goof around!

1:14:09.027 --> 1:14:11.155
-[grunting]
-[mechanical whirring]

1:14:17.786 --> 1:14:19.997
[all grunting]

1:14:27.254 --> 1:14:30.048
[Hibiki] Pitch eight… nine… ten…

1:14:30.132 --> 1:14:30.966
Clear!

1:14:31.675 --> 1:14:32.593
He's booking.

1:14:32.676 --> 1:14:35.304
Bubbles incoming! Head in the game!

1:14:35.387 --> 1:14:37.055
[crashing]

1:14:37.848 --> 1:14:39.141

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:58.452

1:14:58.535 --> 1:14:59.995
[Usagi screaming]

1:15:00.078 --> 1:15:01.955
I'm falling!

1:15:02.581 --> 1:15:04.249
[grunts, panting]

1:15:05.292 --> 1:15:07.377
Would somebody please tell me
what the hell's going on?

1:15:11.965 --> 1:15:13.509
[wind whooshing violently]

1:15:13.592 --> 1:15:16.345
[Isozaki] What? Two spiderwebs?

1:15:16.428 --> 1:15:18.263
[wind whooshing violently]

1:15:19.431 --> 1:15:21.600
Their suction power is unreal.

1:15:21.683 --> 1:15:23.310
-[creaking]
-[crashing]

1:15:23.393 --> 1:15:25.020
[Kai] Hibiki, what now?

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:30.317
[Hibiki] I'm gonna try
reaching the Observatory

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:32.486
using the fragments of the Main Shaft.

1:15:32.569 --> 1:15:33.695
[all gasping]

1:15:34.279 --> 1:15:37.741
But it's at least 30 meters
from the last fragment to the Observatory!

1:15:37.824 --> 1:15:39.159
The boots won't be enough!

1:15:39.243 --> 1:15:40.577
[Shin] I'll take the lead!

1:15:41.453 --> 1:15:42.871
[clanging]

1:15:44.289 --> 1:15:45.290
Oh!

1:15:46.833 --> 1:15:48.043
[Osawa] Shin!

1:15:48.126 --> 1:15:49.753
[Isozaki] What are you doing here?

1:15:49.836 --> 1:15:53.131
I'd like to say that I came
to bring you guys home, but I know better.

1:15:53.632 --> 1:15:57.219
So instead, I thought
you need an experienced leader.

1:15:57.803 --> 1:15:58.929
We're glad you're here.

1:15:59.429 --> 1:16:02.015
Is this really happening?
Shin's finally joining us!

1:16:02.849 --> 1:16:04.059
[Hibiki] What's your plan?

1:16:04.142 --> 1:16:04.977
Listen up.

1:16:05.644 --> 1:16:08.814
[Shin] I'll show you the route
to the final fragment first.

1:16:08.897 --> 1:16:10.983
Just follow me, Hibiki.

1:16:11.066 --> 1:16:12.693
[Hibiki] But, it'll be risky, Shin.

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:17.948
Hm. I've pushed myself here
far more than you.

1:16:18.031 --> 1:16:19.825
Believe me when I say you can trust me.

1:16:21.952 --> 1:16:23.120
Hm.

1:16:24.162 --> 1:16:25.289
[crashing]

1:16:25.914 --> 1:16:26.957
Let's go!

1:16:40.512 --> 1:16:42.097
[grunting]

1:16:51.315 --> 1:16:53.317
Wow! That was insane!

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:55.360
He's busting out that legendary tricking!

1:16:57.946 --> 1:16:58.864
[Isozaki] Look out!

1:17:00.532 --> 1:17:02.701
[all grunting]

1:17:06.788 --> 1:17:09.041
We can't hold it forever! Get moving!

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:11.293
[both grunting]

1:17:15.047 --> 1:17:15.922
Whoa!

1:17:24.598 --> 1:17:25.974
Hurry! This way!

1:17:26.058 --> 1:17:28.310
-Okay, go for it!
-Gotcha!

1:17:28.393 --> 1:17:29.936
[Kai grunting]

1:17:32.606 --> 1:17:34.066
[crashing]

1:17:35.067 --> 1:17:36.568
Get the flag, Hibiki!

1:17:37.277 --> 1:17:39.404
We're bringing Uta home, you hear me!

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:42.449
[Kai groans in effort]

1:17:48.038 --> 1:17:49.456

Jump!

1:18:08.183 --> 1:18:09.976
[shattering]

1:18:13.313 --> 1:18:16.483

1:19:01.361 --> 1:19:02.237
[Shin] Hibiki…

1:19:05.532 --> 1:19:07.951
I tried, but never made it.

1:19:08.994 --> 1:19:11.413
But you can do it. I know you can!

1:19:12.998 --> 1:19:14.875
You're the one who will save her.

1:19:16.918 --> 1:19:18.420
Hm.

1:19:41.568 --> 1:19:42.944
[Hibiki gasps]

1:19:49.993 --> 1:19:53.205
[Hibiki] Is this… five years ago?

1:19:54.664 --> 1:19:57.375
Why is everything the same as it was then?

1:19:59.836 --> 1:20:00.796
Is that…

1:20:02.130 --> 1:20:03.173
me?

1:20:13.475 --> 1:20:14.976
I remember.

1:20:15.769 --> 1:20:17.896
This was the moment I…

1:20:23.068 --> 1:20:24.611
[man] Right then, I'll leave it to you.

1:20:25.445 --> 1:20:27.030
-[girl] Bubbles!
-Huh?

1:20:27.113 --> 1:20:28.490
-Huh?
-Huh?

1:20:30.826 --> 1:20:33.703
[man] Wha… what? What in the world?

1:20:37.374 --> 1:20:40.293
[Uta singing melody]

1:20:58.270 --> 1:20:59.604
Wait, this song…

1:21:00.230 --> 1:21:01.064
it's you?

1:21:01.773 --> 1:21:04.067
[Uta singing melody]

1:21:08.405 --> 1:21:09.948
[young Hibiki] It's okay.

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:12.200
I can hear you just fine.

1:21:18.290 --> 1:21:20.208
It was you all along.

1:21:46.359 --> 1:21:47.777
[Hibiki] This was the moment…

1:21:47.861 --> 1:21:50.822
that I may have
unintentionally angered the bubbles.

1:21:54.534 --> 1:21:55.827
[Uta breathing shakily]

1:22:01.708 --> 1:22:03.752

1:22:14.429 --> 1:22:16.306

1:22:25.190 --> 1:22:27.567
But those bubbles…

1:22:28.652 --> 1:22:31.529
it was her. Uta protected me.

-Where's Hibiki?
-The observatory!

1:24:20.847 --> 1:24:22.682
He went to see the ghost on his own!

1:24:23.266 --> 1:24:24.309
He did what?

1:24:24.809 --> 1:24:26.478
[Shin] Time's moving forward.

1:24:28.938 --> 1:24:31.691

1:28:39.105 --> 1:28:41.816
her body was rapidly
turning into seafoam…

1:28:43.026 --> 1:28:46.946
fear was a complete stranger to her."

1:28:48.948 --> 1:28:51.117
[emotional music intensifying]

1:28:52.952 --> 1:28:54.746
[crashing]

1:29:08.051 --> 1:29:10.511
[emotional music]

1:29:32.533 --> 1:29:34.619
[gasping for air]

1:29:40.291 --> 1:29:41.125
[Hibiki] Uta!

1:29:43.044 --> 1:29:43.878
Uta!

1:29:45.838 --> 1:29:49.592
[panting]
Uta… your body…

1:29:54.847 --> 1:29:57.100
Don't go, Uta!

1:29:57.725 --> 1:29:59.227
[panting]

1:30:05.858 --> 1:30:08.653
[Uta] It's because… I met you…

1:30:10.863 --> 1:30:14.075
So that I could be the me I wanted to be.

1:30:17.370 --> 1:30:18.454
This is…

1:30:19.205 --> 1:30:21.707
the human heart.

1:30:21.791 --> 1:30:23.084
[softly crying]

1:30:23.876 --> 1:30:26.379
It's a heart that's able to feel…

1:30:27.588 --> 1:30:28.840
loneliness.

1:30:30.341 --> 1:30:31.342
[Hibiki sobbing]

1:30:32.176 --> 1:30:33.219
A heart that feels…

1:30:34.011 --> 1:30:35.805
happiness and pain…

1:30:36.973 --> 1:30:38.224
and true love.

1:30:40.643 --> 1:30:42.228
[Hibiki sobbing]

1:30:43.813 --> 1:30:44.939
[Hibiki] Uta!

1:30:47.441 --> 1:30:48.276
Uta!

1:30:49.485 --> 1:30:50.444
Uta!

1:30:53.698 --> 1:30:57.201
[screaming] Uta!

1:30:57.869 --> 1:31:00.746
[heartbroken sobbing]

1:31:08.754 --> 1:31:10.006
Hibiki…

1:31:11.632 --> 1:31:13.176
[shaky breath]

1:31:16.596 --> 1:31:19.473
Where's… Uta?

1:31:20.850 --> 1:31:23.186
[soft high-pitched ringing]

1:31:30.943 --> 1:31:33.696
[Uta's melody ringing]

1:31:53.341 --> 1:31:56.010
[gentle music]

1:32:12.568 --> 1:32:13.653
[Uta breathing]

1:32:13.736 --> 1:32:16.572
[gasps]
Uta…

1:32:17.323 --> 1:32:19.075
It's you, isn't it?

1:32:21.410 --> 1:32:23.246
[sobbing]

1:32:27.124 --> 1:32:30.503
[Uta singing melody]

1:32:44.058 --> 1:32:47.603
[Makoto] The cycle of collapse
and rebirth continues.

1:32:48.437 --> 1:32:52.191
From the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago…

1:32:52.275 --> 1:32:54.402
the elements which make up our bodies

1:32:54.485 --> 1:32:56.737
have reassembled again and again.

1:32:57.363 --> 1:32:58.406
They become stars…

1:32:59.031 --> 1:33:00.700
burn out, contract…

1:33:01.409 --> 1:33:02.952
and shoot out into the universe.

1:33:04.328 --> 1:33:07.373
Gathering in a vortex, they mix together…

1:33:07.456 --> 1:33:09.750
and later, scatter apart.

1:33:23.222 --> 1:33:26.350
Someday, when this world comes to an end

1:33:26.434 --> 1:33:28.936
and the Earth ceases to exist…

1:33:29.770 --> 1:33:35.109
perhaps we too, will once again
become part of a massive vortex.

1:33:37.737 --> 1:33:38.738
Time will tell.

1:33:41.699 --> 1:33:44.285
[Uta] Let's meet again someday.

1:34:01.218 --> 1:34:04.263
UTA

1:34:07.683 --> 1:34:10.061
[construction noises]

1:34:14.315 --> 1:34:16.025
[overlapping chatter]

1:34:19.862 --> 1:34:21.489
[Kai] With our blue blazes…

1:34:21.572 --> 1:34:22.948
[all] We're gonna burn it all down!

1:34:23.032 --> 1:34:23.908
Yeah!

1:34:23.991 --> 1:34:25.076
[Hibiki] It's still lame.

1:34:29.163 --> 1:34:31.791
[Usagi] Oh,
it's the numbnuts ninjas again!

1:34:31.874 --> 1:34:33.667
[Kai] Hey! Ready to get your ass kicked?

1:34:33.751 --> 1:34:36.212
[Denki Ninja leader] Oh, piss off!
We're gonna smoke you guys!

1:34:37.338 --> 1:34:38.589
It's time, everybody!

1:34:39.799 --> 1:34:40.674
Get ready…

1:34:41.509 --> 1:34:42.802
And set…

1:34:42.885 --> 1:34:44.261
[Makoto] Let's do it!

1:34:44.845 --> 1:34:47.264
Kick some butt out there, Blue Blazes!

1:34:48.933 --> 1:34:50.226
-[Shin] Go!
-[shot ringing]

1:34:51.644 --> 1:34:53.854
[all grunting]

1:35:00.111 --> 1:35:01.278
[chuckles]

1:35:04.824 --> 1:35:07.034
[Uta chuckles]

1:35:07.952 --> 1:35:09.286
[Hibiki chuckles]

1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:14.542
[Hibiki grunting]

1:35:20.131 --> 1:35:23.634
[Uta's melody]

1:35:35.604 --> 1:35:38.274
[outro music]
