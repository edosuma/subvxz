* Well, we're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:04.372 --> 00:07.208
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:07.275 --> 00:11.545
* To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.612 --> 00:14.615
* Movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:14.682 --> 00:17.785
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:17.851 --> 00:23.391
* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.094 --> 00:28.662
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.729 --> 00:31.265
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.332 --> 00:33.867
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.934 --> 00:36.470
* Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.537 --> 00:39.039
* Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.107 --> 00:41.542
* As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.609 --> 00:43.277
* There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.344 --> 00:46.080
* We're movin' on up

* We finally got
a piece of the pie *

01:10.070 --> 01:12.106
Now this piece goes...

01:16.677 --> 01:17.678
Here.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.781
Florence, do you mind?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.416
No, I love jigsaw puzzles.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.390
Damn! Damn!

01:30.891 --> 01:32.025
What's the matter, George?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.093
Those damn Russians.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.430
Huh?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.466
They're having problems
over at the UN with
the Russians

01:38.532 --> 01:40.834
so now Andrew Young
ain't gonna make our
dinner tomorrow night.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.103
Oh, that's a shame.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.339
You see, George is in charge
of getting a speaker

01:45.406 --> 01:48.442
for the Harlem Boys Club
fundraising dinner.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.111
Bentley promised me that
I would definitely have
Andrew Young.

01:51.179 --> 01:55.216
Now I ain't got nobody.
Not even a lousy politician.

01:55.283 --> 01:59.453
Oh, but, George, there must be
some other celebrity in
New York you could get.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.722
There is somebody, but I
don't know how to get him.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.724
-Who?
-Billy Dee Williams.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.759
The Billy Dee Williams?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.895
The Billy Dee Williams
who's picture's over my bed?

02:09.830 --> 02:10.931
And over my dresser?

02:11.732 --> 02:14.268
And over my nightstand?

02:14.335 --> 02:17.805
You mean to say you have
three pictures of Billy Dee
Williams in your room?

02:17.871 --> 02:20.274
No, child, just one
great big one.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.212
Mmm. Billy Dee
from head to toe.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.148
Florence, aren't you
getting a little carried away?

02:28.216 --> 02:32.052
I wish I was, Miss Jefferson.
'Cause that man could carry
me away anytime.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.791
What made you think of
Billy Dee Williams, George?

02:37.858 --> 02:41.529
He'd be perfect for the
dinner, Weezy.
He's a big star.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.831
He was raised in Harlem.
And he's in town
making a movie.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.766
You gonna ask him to speak?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.502
Well, I figure it's worth a
try. But first I gotta get his
telephone number.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.070
Oh, forget it,
Mr. Jefferson.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.873
Ain't no way a super somebody
like Billy Dee Williams is

02:52.940 --> 02:54.575
gonna talk to a
nobody like you.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.778
How would you know?

02:57.845 --> 03:00.648
The closest you ever
got to the man is them
dumb fan magazines.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.484
Now those magazines
exaggerate about
all the stars.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.553
Right. Billy Dee ain't no
different from no other man.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.755
He puts his pants on
one leg at a time.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.024
Where did you read that?
It must be a new issue.

03:15.463 --> 03:18.666
The best thing for you would
be to meet him sometime.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.568
I'm gonna meet him right now.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.002
In your bedroom?

03:22.069 --> 03:26.807
Yeah. In my dreams.
I'm gonna get my fan
magazine, take my nap,

03:26.874 --> 03:30.311
and float high and free,
ooh, with Billy Dee.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.349
You know, she's getting
weirder every day, Weezy.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.385
Make sure you keep her
away from the carving knives.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.788
Come on, Helen, how 'bout
some pie and coffee?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.323
Sounds great.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.292
Hey, Weezy, how can you
eat when I got problems?

03:44.358 --> 03:45.826
(DOORBELL RINGING)

03:45.893 --> 03:48.028
George, if I stopped
eating every time you
had a problem,

03:48.095 --> 03:50.163
I would have starved
to death years ago.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.567
Hey, Ralph, did you get it?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.802
Yes, sir, I have
it right here.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.337
Hey...

03:56.404 --> 03:57.938
But it wasn't
an easy job.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.841
Oh...

04:00.908 --> 04:04.745
This caper wasn't a one man
operation, sir. I had to talk
with three doormen before

04:04.812 --> 04:07.815
I even got the name of
Billy Dee Williams' hotel.

04:07.881 --> 04:11.485
-Oh.
-And two maids to get his
room number.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.822
Plus a bellboy to get his
private phone number.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.889
Oh.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.358
Uh-huh...

04:17.425 --> 04:19.760
Well, thanks, Ralph.
I'll call him right now.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.763
Hey, wait a minute.
Florence is right. Suppose he
don't wanna talk to me?

04:24.332 --> 04:26.066
Yeah... Have you thought
of a double, sir?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.200
I just had a drink.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.371
No, sir. I mean a look-a-like.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.406
-A look-a-like?
-Yes, sir! They have
a talent agency

04:32.473 --> 04:36.610
right here in town,
that handles look-a-likes
of famous people.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.380
They hire them out for
all sorts of occasions.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.483
Hey, you think they might
have somebody that looks
like Billy Dee Williams?

04:42.550 --> 04:46.920
It's possible. If you're
interested, I can look
into it further.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.491
Okay, well, look, you go down
there and see if they got a
Billy Dee Williams double.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.025
And if they ain't, see if
they got a double for me

04:52.092 --> 04:53.694
because I'm gonna need
one tomorrow night...

04:57.665 --> 04:58.799
(DOORBELL RINGING)

05:03.504 --> 05:05.606
Oh, Mr. J, I'm so sorry
about Andrew Young,

05:05.673 --> 05:08.942
but the SALT talks with
the Russians are important.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.679
SALT talks? Damn,
first we give them wheat,
and now they want salt!

05:13.714 --> 05:17.451
No, Mr. J, SALT
means Strategic Arms
Limitations Talks.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.788
Uh-huh. And it also means if
I don't get a speaker for
tomorrow night's dinner,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.957
I'm gonna be the laughing
stock of the whole black
businessmen's organization.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.394
Oh, but isn't there somebody
else you can get?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.696
Yeah, somebody I'd like
to get. Billy Dee Williams.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.963
Oh, do you know him?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.332
No, that's the problem.
He won't talk to me.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.302
Oh, yes, I went through that
same problem myself once.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.170
Were you trying to talk
to Billy Dee Williams?

05:37.237 --> 05:39.907
Oh, no, I don't even know him.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.377
No, when I was a student at
Oxford, our cricket club
needed a famous

05:43.444 --> 05:45.312
speaker for a
fundraising dinner.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.381
Oh. What happened?

05:47.448 --> 05:51.485
Oh, it was very nice. We had
roast leg of mutton, and mint
sauce, and buttered parsnips.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.654
I mean, the famous guy.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.089
Oh, well he wouldn't take
any of my phone calls either.

05:56.156 --> 06:01.028
I just wasn't important
enough. But I finally did get
him, or rather, my uncle did.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.263
Oh, your uncle? How?

06:03.330 --> 06:06.033
You see, my uncle's a
famous author. He's a very
important person himself,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.335
so I had him call for me.

06:08.402 --> 06:12.205
Oh, I get it. It takes a
VIP to get to a VIP.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.141
-Exactly.
-Hey!

06:14.207 --> 06:15.509
Bentley, you're a genius.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.078
Oh, no, I do have rather
a high IQ, but

06:18.145 --> 06:21.114
I've always thought of a
true genius as someone
quite eccentric.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.416
Eccentric?

06:22.483 --> 06:25.185
Yes, you know, strange,
weird, a bit daft.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.887
Like I said, Bentley,
you're a real genius.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.660
Famous author...
Famous author...

06:33.694 --> 06:34.795
I got it.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.198
Hmm...

06:47.174 --> 06:48.208
(CLEARING THROAT)

06:49.376 --> 06:51.178
Uh, hello.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.747
I'd like to speak to Billy
Dee Williams, please.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.017
It is? Hey, go ahead!

06:57.084 --> 06:58.652
Oh, Oh. Oh.
Billy Dee Williams?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.521
Right. This is Alex Haley...

07:03.991 --> 07:06.293
That's right, the
famous author.

07:06.359 --> 07:10.430
Look, I'm in town for a worthy
cause. The Harlem Boys Club.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.333
Yes... I'm speaking at a
fundraising dinner for them
tomorrow night

07:13.400 --> 07:16.003
and I was just wondering if
you'd be able to speak, too.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.871
Right... Oh, you can?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.840
Oh, that'd be great.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.776
Yeah, look, we're gonna meet
at George Jefferson's place...

07:22.843 --> 07:26.146
You know, George Jefferson.
The famous dry cleaner
and all-around great guy.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.985
Yeah, he reads all my books
and he's seen all your movies.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.854
Yes, so um, we'll send
a limousine over

07:33.921 --> 07:36.590
to pick you up at your place
tomorrow about 6:00?

07:36.657 --> 07:39.126
Okay, fine, great. Right. Bye.

07:39.192 --> 07:44.197
I did it! I did it! I did it!
I did it! I did it!
Weezy, I did it!

07:44.264 --> 07:47.467
Did what? Swallow a frog?

07:47.535 --> 07:51.471
What is all the noise?
Didn't I tell you all I was
gonna take a nap?

07:51.539 --> 07:54.374
Listen up, everybody.
Guess who's coming
here tomorrow?

07:54.441 --> 07:56.043
How many guesses do we get?

07:56.109 --> 07:59.446
One. I'll even give you a
clue. Billy Dee Williams.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.581
Billy Dee Williams!

08:00.648 --> 08:02.650
Billy Dee Williams is
coming here?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.084
Billy Dee Williams!

08:04.151 --> 08:05.553
He's coming here tomorrow...

08:05.619 --> 08:07.387
-Billy Dee Williams!
-Shut up!

08:09.422 --> 08:11.692
Let me talk!

08:11.759 --> 08:14.494
He's coming here before
me and him go to the
Boys' Club dinner.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.329
George, how did you
arrange that?

08:16.396 --> 08:19.733
Well, it was easy.
I just told him I was a
very important man.

08:19.800 --> 08:24.071
Billy Dee Williams coming
down here on Earth to
mingle with us poor mortals.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.440
Florence, he's only a man.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.342
Only a man, Miss Willis?

08:29.409 --> 08:33.714
You're talking about my
dream prince.
A dude who's one of a kind.

08:33.781 --> 08:38.752
He is sugar and spice and
everything, and I do mean
everything, nice.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.724
Now, Florence, when you meet
Billy Dee Williams in person,

08:43.791 --> 08:47.961
I'm sure you'll find that he's
just an ordinary normal guy.

08:48.028 --> 08:52.165
Well, we'll see how normal he
acts once he gets a load of
me in my blue dress.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.469
Why your blue dress?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.439
'Cause blue is Billy
Dee's favorite color.

08:59.506 --> 09:03.043
Ooh... Oh, Florence,
there's no need to do
anything special

09:03.110 --> 09:05.078
just because Billy Dee
Williams is coming.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.848
Excuse me, Louise.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.251
I better run upstairs
and see if I can get an

09:11.318 --> 09:13.153
appointment with
my hairdresser!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.926
Billy Dee Williams in
this very room!

09:18.992 --> 09:22.495
Well, Lord, You may not
come when we call you,
but you ain't never late.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.567
George...

09:27.635 --> 09:30.537
Do you think we have
time to redecorate
the whole apartment?

09:31.438 --> 09:32.740
What?

09:32.806 --> 09:34.041
(DOORBELL RINGING)

09:34.107 --> 09:35.008
Florence, will you
answer the door?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.983
Oh, Florence, is
Mr. Jefferson around?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.551
He's in the bedroom
with Miss Jefferson...

09:49.690 --> 09:51.191
I have some information
for him.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.660
I'll see that he gets it.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.563
Oh, well, I guess he's
paid me for this already.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.032
Would you tell Mr.
Jefferson that there is indeed

09:59.099 --> 10:00.701
a double for
Billy Dee Williams?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.636
-A double?
-Yes.

10:02.703 --> 10:07.274
If Mr. Jefferson wants to
hire someone who looks exactly
like Billy Dee Williams,

10:07.340 --> 10:11.845
have him call the Famous
Doubles Agency.
This is their phone number.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.146
Hire somebody?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.417
I think he already did that.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.753
Pardon?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.922
Billy Dee Williams' phony
double is coming over
here tomorrow.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.692
Oh, well, then I guess
everything's all right.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.193
Yeah, everything's fine.

10:30.798 --> 10:34.134
Hmm... Everything's just fine.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.070
You can fool some of the
people some of the time,

10:37.137 --> 10:39.539
but you can't fool
Florence Johnston with no

10:39.606 --> 10:42.876
two-bit copy of Billy Dee
Williams none of the time!

10:51.084 --> 10:52.585
(WHISTLING)

10:55.555 --> 10:58.158
(SCATTING)

11:02.229 --> 11:04.331
Hey... Weezy!

11:04.397 --> 11:05.632
Coming, George.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.404
Hey...

11:11.471 --> 11:13.206
Where's Florence?
I want her to make some
hors d'oeuvres.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.442
She's in her room. I'm sure
she doesn't wanna meet

11:15.508 --> 11:18.678
Billy Dee Williams until she
looks absolutely beautiful.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.613
Oh. Well, in that case,
we ain't got nothing
to worry about.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.215
She'll be in there for a year.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.553
George, I still don't
understand how you

11:26.619 --> 11:29.222
managed to get Billy Dee
Williams to come over here.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.491
Well, Weezy, that's what
I've been wanting to tell you.
See, uh...

11:31.558 --> 11:32.726
-(DOORBELL RINGING)
-George!

11:32.793 --> 11:34.795
-It's him!
-Hey, Weezy, wait a minute!

11:39.800 --> 11:41.134
Welcome!

11:42.435 --> 11:44.171
Why, thank you, Louise.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.342
What are you doing here?

11:49.409 --> 11:51.644
Well, (STAMMERING) I was
just going out to buy
some groceries.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.614
You got all dressed up
to go shopping?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.217
Well, you never know
who you might run into
in a supermarket.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.952
Do you wanna go
with me, Louise?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.823
Oh, I'd like to, Helen,
but Billy Dee Williams
will be here soon.

12:02.890 --> 12:07.027
Oh, that's right!

12:07.094 --> 12:12.465
Well, I may as well just
stay here and wait.
We can go after he leaves.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.668
Oh, what a lovely
blue outfit, Helen.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.905
Oh, thank you, Louise.
I love blue.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.306
Me, too...

12:24.711 --> 12:27.948
Man, if you two are all
dressed up, I can imagine what
Florence is gonna look like.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.523
Somebody call me?

12:38.258 --> 12:41.061
Florence, why are you
dressed like that?

12:41.128 --> 12:44.264
Well, I'm through with my work
so I decided to relax for the
rest of the evening.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.434
Well, go someplace else and
relax! I don't want you
scaring Billy Dee to death!

12:49.036 --> 12:50.971
Florence, he'll be
here any minute.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.706
Yeah, I know.
But I got to thinking
about what you all said.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.642
He's just an ordinary guy.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.511
Ain't no need to get all
gussied up for him.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.848
After all, you two didn't
do nothing special.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.987
Florence, I'm gonna give
you three seconds to get lost.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.655
-One!
-George!

13:08.721 --> 13:10.790
-Two!
-Florence isn't
hurting anything.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.826
Yes, George, I'm sure
Mr. Williams won't mind.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.627
Won't mind? The hell he won't!

13:14.694 --> 13:16.696
I want everything to be right!

13:16.763 --> 13:18.398
He don't wanna be
hanging around with no
sloppy looking old maid!

13:18.999 --> 13:20.233
(ALL ARGUING)

13:20.300 --> 13:21.434
No, I don't wanna hear it.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.912
Excuse me...

13:33.080 --> 13:34.381
Excuse me...

13:35.382 --> 13:36.917
Is this the... Excuse me.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.718
Is this the
Jeffersons' apartment?

13:41.021 --> 13:44.524
Billy Dee! Come on in!
Hey, I'm George Jefferson.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.693
-Billy Dee Williams.
-Oh, you ain't gotta
tell me that!

13:46.759 --> 13:50.097
Hey, uh, Billy Dee, I want
you to meet my wife, Louise.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.798
Pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Jefferson.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.234
Oh, call me Louise,
Dilly Bee...

13:59.472 --> 14:01.641
Willy Dip...
Uh, I mean...

14:02.910 --> 14:04.978
Can I call you...

14:05.045 --> 14:07.814
You can call me anything you
want, Louise. Billy Dee,
Billy, it doesn't matter...

14:14.421 --> 14:15.923
Oh!

14:15.989 --> 14:17.557
Excuse me, Willy Bill...

14:19.159 --> 14:20.193
I mean, Billy Cee...

14:20.260 --> 14:21.861
-Billy Dee.
-Uh, Billy Dee.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.367
And this is our neighbor,
Helen Willis.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.635
Oh, hello, Helen.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.603
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

14:35.208 --> 14:36.576
It's nice to meet you.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.478
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Nice to meet you, too.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.014
I mean, it's...

14:41.081 --> 14:42.782
I think I need a
drink of water.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.387
This is our maid, Florence.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.090
She's getting ready to go to
bed. She's not feeling too
good, as you can see.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.859
I'm feeling fine.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.861
Pleased to meet you, Florence.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.663
That goes double for me.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.566
And I do mean, double.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.305
-Won't you sit down, Billy?
-Thank you.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.744
Won't you join me, please?

15:11.811 --> 15:13.646
Oh, I'd love to...

15:24.291 --> 15:25.993
Is Alex here yet?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.594
-Alex?
-Yes, Alex Haley.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.900
Alex Haley?
Is he coming here, too?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.969
Oh, yes, he's a good
friend of your husband's.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.405
He is? Why, George,
I didn't...

15:38.471 --> 15:40.407
Alex will be here any minute.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.675
Come here, Weezy,
I wanna see you in the
kitchen a minute.

15:42.742 --> 15:45.178
Hey, Florence, look, make
sure you give our special
guest anything he wants.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.646
Be right back...

16:00.560 --> 16:04.064
So, you're Billy
Dee Williams, huh?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.866
Well, that's what
my mama told me.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.469
Okay. What'd you have for
breakfast this morning?

16:10.837 --> 16:13.673
Um, a cheese omelet.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.108
Cheese omelet?

16:15.175 --> 16:16.876
On Thursday?

16:16.943 --> 16:20.213
For your information, Billy
Dee Williams always has

16:20.280 --> 16:23.083
poached eggs and orange
juice on Thursday.

16:24.851 --> 16:28.088
He does? I mean...
I mean, I do?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.357
What's the matter with you?
Don't you read the
fan magazines?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.891
No, not really. No.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.660
Well, you better start, honey.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.696
That is, if you want to
do your job right.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.734
Gee, up until now, I
thought I was doing okay...

16:54.647 --> 16:56.649
In Lady Sings The Blues,

16:56.716 --> 17:01.454
did Diana Ross wear her
flower in her hair on the
right side or on the left?

17:04.391 --> 17:05.858
Uh...

17:05.925 --> 17:07.094
-Right.
-Ah-ha!

17:08.961 --> 17:10.097
Left?

17:13.166 --> 17:17.370
Listen, mister, whoever's
paying you sure ain't getting
their money's worth.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.472
Well, you won't tell the
studio, will you?

17:19.539 --> 17:22.509
Studio? Hmm...
I got your studio.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.314
So that's why I had to
say I was Alex Haley.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.382
But, George,
you lied to the man.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.684
So what? I lied a little bit.
It worked, didn't it?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.286
Billy Dee Williams is here.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.521
He sure is.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.925
Well, I'm gonna
tell him the truth.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.793
Okay, Weezy, but it's
gonna be all your fault.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.730
What will be my fault?

17:43.796 --> 17:47.167
When Billy Dee finds out that
Alex Haley ain't coming,
he's gonna probably split.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.602
And all them poor kids who
were depending on this benefit

17:49.669 --> 17:52.071
to help their Boys' Club are
gonna be out of luck.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.873
Them poor kids will be
standing around on the street

17:53.940 --> 17:57.944
with nothing to do, saying,
"Man, I wish that old
mean lady didn't tell

17:58.010 --> 17:59.712
"Billy Dee Williams about
Alex Haley.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.783
"We'd have had
some place to play."

18:03.850 --> 18:06.319
George, that's not fair.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.988
Okay, Weezy. See?
I knew you'd let me handle it.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.291
Now, come on, let's go in
here and visit with Billy Dee.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.260
Hey, Billy Dee.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.427
How are you and
Florence getting along?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.530
Oh, fantastic. Yeah, she's
been teaching me a lot.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.599
So far, I've learned
that I've been eating
the wrong food,

18:19.666 --> 18:23.370
I don't ride my bike enough,
and I have the wrong
favorite number.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.872
Well, look, we better get
going. We don't want them
to start without us.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.240
Oh, I think we ought to
wait for Alex.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.309
Alex? Oh, yeah... Oh.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.811
Well, he probably got tied up.
You know how
famous authors are.

18:31.878 --> 18:32.912
Well, maybe we
should call him.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.247
Oh, no, I'll call him!

18:37.250 --> 18:39.286
Uh, Billy...

18:39.352 --> 18:43.623
I wondered if I could ask you
to autograph my copy of
Lady Sings The Blues?

18:43.690 --> 18:44.757
Oh, I'd be glad to.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.094
Uh, have you got a pen?

18:53.200 --> 18:54.867
-A pen?
-Yes.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.805
Oh, yes. A pen...

18:58.871 --> 19:02.275
Oh, how silly of me.
Uh, I'll, I'll get one.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.448
Well, Billy,
how's Hollywood?

19:08.515 --> 19:09.716
Uh, smoggy.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.652
What's Diana Ross really like?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.254
Well, she's...

19:14.321 --> 19:16.055
Do you know Burt Reynolds?
What about Marlon Brando?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.190
-Here's a pen.
-Thank you.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.325
-Excuse me...
-Yes.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.498
Now me.

19:28.100 --> 19:32.472
Uh-huh... Right, yeah, I
understand. Yeah, I'll
tell him, Alex.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.041
-Is that Alex?
-Yeah.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.209
Well, let me say hello to him.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.810
You gotta go? Okay, bye.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.549
Are you sure that
was Alex Haley?

19:42.615 --> 19:43.916
Sure. Why?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.518
Well, all I heard was
a humming sound.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.389
Humming? Oh, that must
have been his typewriter.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.823
He's gonna write a new
book, Roots Three.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.628
He said it's humming
right along.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.930
Oh, by the way, he
said he won't be able
to make the dinner.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.299
Ahh...

19:59.366 --> 20:01.268
He's got a bad cold.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.771
Really? When I talked to
him this morning,
he sounded fine.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.806
This morning?
You mean last night.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.776
No, when I talked to him
last night, he sounded
a lot like you.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.044
Like me?

20:12.111 --> 20:14.781
Yeah. When I talked to
Alex Haley this morning
he was in Los Angeles.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.883
He's been there all week.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.986
Oh. So, you mean that you
knew all along that...

20:20.052 --> 20:23.690
It was you that was
calling me last night?
I'm afraid so, yes.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.593
Well, if you knew all that,
how come you still agreed
to speak at the dinner?

20:27.527 --> 20:28.628
Well,

20:29.596 --> 20:30.730
you see, I grew up
in Harlem...

20:30.797 --> 20:32.031
You got that one right.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.207
And I love kids. And I
know the Harlem Boys' Club
is a good cause.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.910
And you, uh, you ain't mad
at me for lying and saying
I was Alex Haley?

20:43.976 --> 20:46.145
No, no. I knew where you
were coming from.

20:46.212 --> 20:50.116
However, I do wish you
would have told me who
you really were.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.119
Well, if that ain't the pot
calling the kettle black.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.392
Florence, will you stop
talking crazy?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.260
Oh, it's about time you knew
the truth, Miss Jefferson.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.763
This turkey ain't
Billy Dee Williams.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.064
Florence, what the hell
are you talking about?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.599
Oh, don't act so
innocent, shorty.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.170
I know all about that
Famous Doubles Agency.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.205
Florence, what are you
talking about?

21:13.272 --> 21:16.543
I mean, this dude is a
good likeness, and he's
handsome and all that.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.946
But he can't fool Billy Dee
Williams' number one fan.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.048
Are you really my
number one fan?

21:22.114 --> 21:27.687
No. I'm Billy Dee Williams'
number one fan. And I know
a phony when I see one.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.757
Let's go, Billy.

21:30.823 --> 21:34.661
All right. Uh, listen,
it's, it's been very nice
meeting you. And, uh...

21:37.430 --> 21:39.366
And I hope to see you
again soon.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.100
Take care.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.802
(DOORBELL RINGING)

21:42.869 --> 21:44.971
Mr. Jefferson,
is Mr. Williams still here?

21:45.037 --> 21:47.807
Oh, no, he ain't.
And he never was.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.809
Then who's that?

21:49.876 --> 21:52.311
I don't know who that is.
I just know who it ain't.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.748
Well, whoever it is, I
mean whoever it ain't,

21:55.815 --> 21:59.085
he dropped his wallet in the
backseat of the limousine and
the driver gave it to me, and

21:59.151 --> 22:01.120
I brought it
right up immediately.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.724
Thanks, brother.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.531
-This yours?
-Yes. Thank you, very much.

22:11.598 --> 22:16.002
Oh, no, you don't. Now
we'll just find out who
you are, Mr...

22:17.103 --> 22:18.538
Mr...

22:29.449 --> 22:31.551
You want my arm to fall off?

22:31.618 --> 22:32.685
What'd you say?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.823
Do you want my
arm to fall off?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.559
That's the line he said to
Diana Ross when he first saw
her in Lady Sings The Blues!

22:39.626 --> 22:41.093
Hey, I got another
one, right...

22:42.729 --> 22:46.666
It's Billy Dee Williams!
It's Billy Dee Williams!

22:46.733 --> 22:50.236
It's Billy Dee... It's Billy
Dee Williams up here, you all!

22:50.302 --> 22:51.638
Billy Dee Williams,
Miss Jefferson!

22:51.704 --> 22:53.072
The real Billy Dee Williams!

22:53.139 --> 22:54.941
I'm afraid so, yes.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.710
Well, now that we got
that all settled, let's
get going before it gets late.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.978
Wait! You can't take him now!

23:00.112 --> 23:02.048
It's Billy Dee Williams!

23:02.114 --> 23:05.818
Wait a minute, Billy.
I'm gonna put on my blue
dress. I'll be right back.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.521
