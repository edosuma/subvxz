WEBVTT

00:17.010 --> 00:18.190
DAD

00:27.070 --> 00:29.120
And... push!

00:29.140 --> 00:33.079
The little head is peaking out!
The little head is peaking out!

00:35.200 --> 00:38.060
No, it'll come out when it has
to.

00:38.079 --> 00:42.179
-If you don't push, it never
will.
-And if I do, my haemorrhoid
will burst.

00:43.009 --> 00:46.229
Who would take a laxative
just before going on a trip?

00:47.009 --> 00:50.100
When I took it, I didn't know
we were going to Tarazona.

00:50.119 --> 00:52.079
You should have told them
on the phone.

00:52.100 --> 00:56.039
You don't tell things like this
on the phone. It needs to be in
person.

01:04.079 --> 01:05.180
Are you okay?

01:14.150 --> 01:16.019
Hey, why not hook up with Gary?

01:16.129 --> 01:19.129
Truth is, I thought he'd be
a lot more of a mongol.

01:19.150 --> 01:23.019
And he's actually a hottie.
Jesus, it's Juanito's dad!

01:23.090 --> 01:25.000
-You're taking the mickey?
-No, no.

01:25.019 --> 01:28.090
No, I'm not taking the mickey.
Why not give it a try with him?

01:28.109 --> 01:29.180
I don't fancy him.

01:30.189 --> 01:32.049
It's because he's a retard.

01:32.069 --> 01:34.200
You say "special needs."

01:35.069 --> 01:36.219
Besides, that's not the point.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.060
Remember that I made out
with him once.

01:39.150 --> 01:42.180
-But you were totally wired.
-Leave me alone.

01:43.140 --> 01:47.009
You act all alternative,
but you're totally superficial,
dude...

01:47.030 --> 01:48.020
Will you shut up?

01:48.039 --> 01:49.159
Gotcha, Gari!

01:50.219 --> 01:52.140
Wait, wait...

01:55.060 --> 01:56.150
What are you doing?

01:56.170 --> 01:58.170
-You plan on driving?
-It's a beer.

01:58.189 --> 02:01.010
The breathalyser won't detect
it.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.150
PERFECT LIFE

02:06.170 --> 02:08.030
WHEN YOU OWN UP TO YOUR PARENTS

02:08.050 --> 02:09.219
María Aguado...

02:10.000 --> 02:11.099
Is a so-and-so!

02:12.090 --> 02:14.120
María Aguado...

02:14.219 --> 02:16.229
Is a so-and-so!

02:17.009 --> 02:20.099
-Nice one.
-And her mouth is as big as a
house.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.120
It's the first time in my life
that I made something rhyme.

02:24.139 --> 02:26.139
This is sort of like bullying,
you know.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.030
It was a joke.

02:28.050 --> 02:31.060
Hey, do your lot use apps
to pick up people?

02:31.210 --> 02:33.180
-I don't understand.
-Yeah, you know.

02:33.199 --> 02:35.210
There are apps for straights,
gays,
lesbians.

02:35.229 --> 02:38.150
-What about your lot?
-You don't need to answer.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.229
Quit saying "your lot".
Leg down and buckle up.

02:41.009 --> 02:44.199
Know what? You can meet
really weird people online.

02:44.219 --> 02:47.009
I prefer face to face, you know?

02:47.150 --> 02:49.219
-Have you had girlfriends?
-Yeah, four.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.229
But Nuri was the only serious
one.

02:53.009 --> 02:55.000
How long were you with her?

02:55.020 --> 02:56.159
Three wonderful years.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.099
-Why did you split up?
-That's personal.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.139
Right, Esther. It's personal.

03:01.159 --> 03:03.139
And belt up once and for all.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.219
Can you give me a hand?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.110
Would you write "I like eating
pussy"
or "I like performing
cunnilingus"?

03:10.060 --> 03:11.229
You don't have to answer that.

03:12.009 --> 03:13.159
You know what cunnilingus is?

03:13.180 --> 03:14.199
Yes.

03:15.110 --> 03:18.030
Stimulating the clitoris with
your tongue.

03:18.050 --> 03:19.120
Wow, dude!

03:21.219 --> 03:24.069
Are you really going to hook up
in Tarazona?

03:24.090 --> 03:26.180
Give me a break, you're such a
pain...

03:27.090 --> 03:28.189
Hi, Xosé!

03:28.210 --> 03:30.079
Where are you?

03:30.099 --> 03:34.110
I'm with María, we're on our way
to tell her parents she's
pregnant.

03:34.129 --> 03:36.189
Where do they live?

03:37.060 --> 03:38.180
-Tarazona.
-In Tarazona?

03:39.110 --> 03:40.120
Yeah.

03:40.229 --> 03:43.020
But Gari...

03:43.039 --> 03:45.030
You can't leave Barcelona like
that.

03:45.189 --> 03:46.150
Yeah.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.229
It was sort of an improvised
trip.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.000
All right...

03:50.020 --> 03:51.210
And what's the exact address?

03:54.069 --> 03:57.120
Number 8 Aldaraz Street.

03:57.139 --> 04:01.030
-Seven.
-Ah, no. seven. Number seven.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.219
Gari...

04:03.000 --> 04:07.020
Do you think it's normal
to vanish like that and not take
my calls?

04:07.189 --> 04:08.199
Gari...?

04:09.090 --> 04:10.129
Gari!

04:12.199 --> 04:14.030
He hung up.

04:16.170 --> 04:20.069
Can you tell me what I did
for him to treat me that way?

04:20.089 --> 04:21.180
We have to go and look for him.

04:23.009 --> 04:24.060
Where? To Tarazona?

04:38.170 --> 04:39.209
We're here.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.180
Let's go back.
I'm going to upset them.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.129
No way.
They'll love being grandparents,
silly.

04:46.149 --> 04:48.040
No, no. You don't understand.

04:48.060 --> 04:50.050
The wedding was so important for
them.

04:50.069 --> 04:53.129
Remember the fuss when I told
them
I didn't want a church wedding?

04:53.149 --> 04:55.230
My parents are super Catholic,
like, super.

04:56.009 --> 04:57.090
Especially my mum.

04:58.069 --> 05:00.129
I can see it already.
Dad will start crying,

05:00.149 --> 05:02.230
Mum will look at me
like when she looks at you.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.089
What look?

05:05.209 --> 05:07.189
Like you're a lost cause.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.180
Right...

05:10.050 --> 05:11.189
Okay, so what do you suggest?

05:11.209 --> 05:13.149
What do we do, huh?

05:13.170 --> 05:16.120
You arrive and just let it rip
without thinking too much.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.199
Okay, you're right.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.060
Hang on,

05:21.079 --> 05:22.100
can you tell?

05:24.040 --> 05:24.189
Yeah.

05:24.209 --> 05:26.029
They'll be able to tell.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.079
You're gonna tell them.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.220
It's always open.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.199
Dad, Mum!

06:09.189 --> 06:11.120
-José Antonio!
-Good grief!

06:12.000 --> 06:15.029
-You gave me a fright.
-What's up?

06:15.189 --> 06:18.089
-How are you both?
-Surprise, Dad!

06:18.110 --> 06:20.199
-But what are you doing here?
-We came to see you.

06:20.220 --> 06:22.079
-All right...
-How are you?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.000
Fine, really great.

06:24.019 --> 06:25.170
This is Gari, a friend.

06:25.189 --> 06:27.199
Pleased to meet you, sir.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.180
And this is our dad, José
Antonio.

06:29.199 --> 06:31.040
And Gustavo didn't come?

06:31.230 --> 06:34.079
Gustavo is working.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.019
-On Saturday?
-Yep.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.090
Companies now, you know,
the poor guy is...

06:38.110 --> 06:40.090
What about all of this food?

06:40.110 --> 06:42.079
I bought a food processor.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.170
-Really?
-Yes.

06:43.189 --> 06:47.029
-You couldn't be bothered to
cook.
-Yes, but now the processor does
it.

06:47.050 --> 06:50.139
There's an app here,
you go on the website.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.230
It's really addictive.

06:52.009 --> 06:55.199
Right now I'm making
sardines with dark brown bulgur.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.189
But why are you making so much
food?
It'll go off.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.050
No, no. Look.

07:00.069 --> 07:02.180
Half of this goes in the
freezer.

07:02.199 --> 07:04.199
That way,
we have food for the whole week.

07:04.220 --> 07:08.100
Look, I made
pumpkin cream soup with ricotta.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.170
-Cod with pil pil sauce...
-Dad...

07:10.189 --> 07:11.230
What?

07:12.089 --> 07:13.100
Where's Mum?

07:13.160 --> 07:15.170
Mum... Mum.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.060
All right, let's see...

07:18.189 --> 07:20.220
Your mother has...

07:21.089 --> 07:22.110
Has what?

07:22.129 --> 07:24.050
She has...

07:24.189 --> 07:26.170
She has a crisis of faith.

07:28.029 --> 07:30.050
She's been in the study for
three days.

07:30.189 --> 07:32.170
Says she no longer believes in
God.

07:33.079 --> 07:35.110
And that Jesus Christ never
existed.

07:36.019 --> 07:39.029
And that if he did exist,
he might have been a crook.

07:39.050 --> 07:40.139
And what can we do?

07:44.090 --> 07:45.110
What?

07:47.149 --> 07:48.199
Mum.

07:50.029 --> 07:51.040
What are you doing here?

07:51.060 --> 07:53.090
Dad says you're an apostate!

07:53.110 --> 07:57.149
Did you know there are
historians
who say Jesus didn't even exist?

07:58.050 --> 07:59.100
When did you last shower?

07:59.120 --> 08:02.199
Then there are others who
believe
he could have been several
people.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.189
"The historical figure of Jesus,
if he existed,

08:06.060 --> 08:10.189
could have been a messianic
king,
a Pharisee, a shaman from
Galilee

08:10.209 --> 08:12.170
or a Hellenistic scholar."

08:13.139 --> 08:15.199
The New Testament
is based on a farce.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.189
That hairstyle doesn't suit you.

08:19.209 --> 08:20.139
Hang on...

08:20.160 --> 08:22.000
A crisis of faith is one thing,

08:22.019 --> 08:24.100
being holed up here
without washing is another.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.139
Come on, in the bathtub. Move.

08:26.220 --> 08:30.009
You don't know how glad I am
you didn't listen to me

08:30.029 --> 08:32.059
and are having a civil ceremony.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.090
You make me so happy, love.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.159
Ouch...

08:39.009 --> 08:40.080
A stomach cramp.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.100
-Oh.
-I have diarrhoea.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.000
Be right back.

08:44.019 --> 08:45.039
Give me a hug.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.159
-You're so beautiful!
-Oh, sweetheart.

08:48.200 --> 08:51.129
You're like a philosophy
student.

08:52.129 --> 08:53.190
Do you know what I think?

08:54.029 --> 08:55.220
I'm really proud of you.

08:58.049 --> 08:59.139
Isn't that my painting?

08:59.159 --> 09:03.129
I'm too tied up with this
subject,
you better ask your dad...

09:03.149 --> 09:04.230
Talk to him.

09:05.009 --> 09:06.080
I don't believe it.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.090
-Do you work with María at the
surgery?
-No.

09:17.110 --> 09:18.120
Where do you work?

09:19.090 --> 09:21.029
-Somewhere else.
-Where?

09:21.049 --> 09:22.220
Err, somewhere.

09:24.009 --> 09:26.000
What's this about, Dad?

09:26.200 --> 09:30.080
You took down my painting
and hung up a turtle, huh?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.070
We didn't know you were coming.

09:32.090 --> 09:33.110
You didn't know...?

09:33.129 --> 09:35.139
So you only hang it up when I
come?

09:35.159 --> 09:38.080
No, that's not it.
It doesn't go with the décor
here.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.230
And this really does, right?

09:40.009 --> 09:42.070
I'll go and fetch the painting
and hang it up.

09:42.090 --> 09:44.149
Bollocks!
Don't do it out of pity.

09:44.169 --> 09:46.220
-It isn't out of pity,
sweetheart.
-What is it?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.220
You're ashamed to hang it there?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.169
Ashamed?
But why would I be ashamed?

09:51.190 --> 09:53.129
All right, you don't like it,
then.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.009
Do you like my painting or not,
Dad?

09:57.029 --> 09:59.159
Look, it's not important
if I like it or not.

09:59.179 --> 10:01.070
People have to like it.

10:01.159 --> 10:02.200
-Dad.
-What?

10:02.220 --> 10:04.029
Tell me the truth.

10:05.159 --> 10:09.000
Listen, I always told you
you should have done a degree.

10:09.019 --> 10:12.029
Here we go again.
Fine Arts is a degree!

10:12.049 --> 10:14.090
But there aren't many job
opportunities.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.139
The proof is that
you're not making a living.

10:16.159 --> 10:20.090
Well you were sure proud of me
when I won La Caixa award!

10:20.110 --> 10:23.179
And I still am, sweetheart.
But that was 15 years ago.

10:24.059 --> 10:27.159
-The thing is, you've never
supported me.
-Please don't say that.

10:28.009 --> 10:30.179
Your Mum and I
give you 600 euros a month.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.169
-Right.
-And I don't mind.

10:32.190 --> 10:35.210
What worries me
is that you're almost 40

10:35.230 --> 10:38.110
and you still act like a
teenager.

10:39.009 --> 10:42.169
You know what?
I don't need your money.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.190
And I'm your daughter, okay!

10:53.210 --> 10:57.139
As a father, you have the moral
duty
to always have my painting on
the wall!

10:57.159 --> 10:59.120
Not just when I come. Always.

10:59.139 --> 11:01.169
I painted it with a lot of love!

11:01.190 --> 11:04.009
I even made you look handsome!
Jesus!

11:04.029 --> 11:06.120
That fucking turtle
is as ugly as shit!

11:10.080 --> 11:12.049
Don't ever have children.

11:30.169 --> 11:35.049
Hi, it's Gari. I can't answer
right now.
Call again later, thanks.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.049
Look, I'm not angry, okay?

11:38.120 --> 11:41.070
Why not call me
and we can talk about it calmly?

11:41.129 --> 11:43.120
All right. Speak soon.

11:52.019 --> 11:53.179
It's delicious, Dad.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.029
Thanks, love.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.159
By the way...

11:56.179 --> 11:58.210
You need to talk with your
sister.

11:58.230 --> 12:01.070
I think she's a bit depressed.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.080
That's between you guys.
She only gets like that here.

12:06.110 --> 12:07.149
Are you religious?

12:07.169 --> 12:08.200
Mum...

12:09.139 --> 12:10.190
That's personal.

12:10.210 --> 12:12.039
I'm Jewish.

12:12.179 --> 12:14.190
-Are you Jewish?
-Yes.

12:14.210 --> 12:17.129
My grandparents were French
Jews.

12:18.190 --> 12:21.059
The Jews, they were swindled
too!

12:21.080 --> 12:23.080
No one gets off here.

12:23.139 --> 12:26.139
-And do you speak French?
-Un petit peu...

12:26.159 --> 12:28.029
mais je ne pratique pas.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.100
I spent summers in Saint Jean
Pied de Port,

12:31.120 --> 12:34.139
at my grandmother's house,
in France.

12:36.009 --> 12:37.129
Do you have children?

12:43.029 --> 12:44.049
No.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.169
And if you have them one day,
will you cut off their...

12:52.059 --> 12:53.149
Would you?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.070
I don't know.

12:55.230 --> 12:58.159
-We'd need to discuss it...
-With the mother.

12:59.009 --> 13:00.210
He'd discuss it with the mother.

13:00.230 --> 13:03.120
-Yes, with the mother, of
course.
-Not with you.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.070
It's just a question,
no need to get like that.

13:06.159 --> 13:08.039
I don't know what you're on
about.

13:08.059 --> 13:09.029
You're very sharp.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.159
Same as you.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.120
Aroa...

13:24.139 --> 13:26.169
Sorry, I'm eating.

13:26.190 --> 13:28.210
Hey, I'm in Tarazona.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.210
What are you up to?

13:31.200 --> 13:34.000
Fancy having a drink or
something?

13:34.019 --> 13:36.070
Maybe it's a bit early, but...

13:36.139 --> 13:38.179
A few beers and some appetizers?

13:38.200 --> 13:41.000
-Okay. Because I...
-Lower your voice!

13:41.019 --> 13:42.179
Okay, okay.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.090
What I don't understand...

13:45.110 --> 13:47.009
-Shush!
-...is why you made me come...

13:47.029 --> 13:49.190
if you're not going to tell your
parents.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.169
Are you circumcised?

13:52.169 --> 13:55.019
You should already know that,
right?

13:55.039 --> 13:56.059
Me?

13:57.230 --> 14:00.149
-Well, okay. I didn't notice.
-Oh.

14:00.169 --> 14:01.210
But are you or not?

14:01.230 --> 14:03.129
Yes, because I'm Jewish.

14:05.009 --> 14:06.129
Why didn't you tell me?

14:06.149 --> 14:08.110
Because you didn't ask.

14:08.129 --> 14:10.080
Don't you think I should know?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.169
I didn't know you were Catholic.

14:12.190 --> 14:15.139
-Well, because I don't practice.
-Me neither.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.000
All right, whatever.

14:17.019 --> 14:19.169
Do you want to cut off
your son's foreskin?

14:19.190 --> 14:21.179
Look, María. Judaism is a thing

14:21.200 --> 14:26.149
that is passed on from mother to
child,
not father to child. Understand?

14:30.129 --> 14:32.129
Tell me your life story right
now.

14:33.110 --> 14:35.149
Don't let them score!

14:35.169 --> 14:37.029
You can do it, Inés!

14:38.210 --> 14:40.100
Come on, come on!

14:45.039 --> 14:46.159
How's life in Barcelona?

14:46.179 --> 14:48.039
Fucking brilliant.

14:48.059 --> 14:50.190
-Yeah, really cool.
-It must be awesome.

14:50.210 --> 14:54.019
Bohemian lifestyle, big parties,
showbiz bashes.

14:54.039 --> 14:56.200
-Orgies...
-You're so stupid.

14:57.039 --> 14:59.159
She went to Barcelona, not New
York.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.230
Was that a foul? Umpire!

15:02.009 --> 15:04.080
Umpire, keep your eyes peeled!

15:05.200 --> 15:07.039
What are you doing?

15:09.049 --> 15:10.179
Smells good, but quit that...

15:10.200 --> 15:13.049
-A joint.
-There are kids everywhere.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.179
All right, I don't know.
How about we smoke it later?

15:17.120 --> 15:18.200
I don't smoke anymore.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.070
Because you're preggers.

15:21.100 --> 15:25.120
Your mummy and me
used to get out of our heads,
girls!

15:25.139 --> 15:28.009
Incredible, dude.
We were such teaheads.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.210
Know what? The guy who sold us
hash
is now a teacher here.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.009
It's true!

15:33.100 --> 15:36.139
That Chinese guy from Loghan?
The one with the hair...?

15:39.080 --> 15:40.220
Let's go to Loghan.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.090
Let's go to Loghan.

15:42.110 --> 15:43.169
-Now?
-Yeah.

15:43.190 --> 15:45.159
We can't go to Loghan.

15:45.179 --> 15:48.080
Let us know next time
and we'll look for a babysitter.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.009
Besides, we're going to see
the latest Pixar film now.

15:51.029 --> 15:52.190
-We are going?
-Come with us!

15:52.210 --> 15:54.090
-Sure.
-Come on.

15:56.029 --> 15:57.149
¡Holy shit!

16:01.220 --> 16:06.029
Hi, it's Gari. I can't answer
right now.
Call again later, thanks.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.009
I'm getting sick of this!

16:09.029 --> 16:10.200
I've been calling you all day!

16:10.220 --> 16:12.200
Please pick up!

16:17.100 --> 16:21.019
I'm living in a supervised flat
at the moment...

16:21.159 --> 16:25.019
with Richi and Nata,
my best mates.

16:25.100 --> 16:29.179
Nuri lived with us up to a year
ago,
but not anymore.

16:30.039 --> 16:32.169
-In the car you said Nuri was
your ex.
-Yeah.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.149
Why did you split up?

16:36.059 --> 16:39.179
-Why do you want to know that?
-Because we're bonding.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.100
We need to talk about this
stuff.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.179
You can ask me whatever you
want.
Go ahead.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.059
Err...

16:46.190 --> 16:48.190
-Your favourite colour?
-Turquoise.

16:48.210 --> 16:51.009
-But questions like that
aren't...
-No?

16:51.029 --> 16:52.190
They have to be more personal.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.000
It's like...

16:54.019 --> 16:57.019
If you ask me about Gustavo,
I'd say that he left me

16:57.039 --> 17:00.190
because I asked him to give me
an enema before having anal sex.

17:01.070 --> 17:02.129
Your turn.

17:03.179 --> 17:04.210
Your turn.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.019
Oh, okay.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.039
Let's see. Well...

17:09.220 --> 17:11.210
Nuri left me...

17:13.180 --> 17:15.220
because she fell in love
with someone else.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.210
Oh, sorry.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.140
No, it's all right.
It's not your fault.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.029
Sorry about your relationship,
too.

17:24.230 --> 17:26.049
Honestly.

17:30.039 --> 17:31.210
-You see?
-What?

17:32.140 --> 17:34.039
We're connecting.

17:34.059 --> 17:36.009
Can you tell? I can.

17:36.029 --> 17:37.119
-Yeah.
-Let's carry on.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.079
Does death frighten you?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.220
The usual.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.200
It disturbs me.

17:44.220 --> 17:48.000
My mum choked
on a piece of chocolate

17:48.019 --> 17:51.220
and Dad had to perform that
manouevre
where they squeeze you here...

17:52.000 --> 17:54.039
-Yeah, when...
-It has a name.

17:54.109 --> 17:57.089
-And...
-LikeMrs. Doubtfire.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.119
-Have you seen it?
-No.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.170
Doesn't matter.

18:01.190 --> 18:04.069
-Do you get on well with your
dad?
-Yeah.

18:04.089 --> 18:06.059
Do you have other family?

18:06.079 --> 18:07.089
Do you have phobias?

18:07.109 --> 18:10.009
-Did you always want to be a
gardener?
-No.

18:10.029 --> 18:13.210
I thought that I'd like to be

18:13.230 --> 18:16.079
the person who organises

18:16.099 --> 18:20.200
metropolitan bus and metro
routes.

18:22.190 --> 18:24.049
And what do you like doing?

18:24.109 --> 18:29.140
Have you ever had sex
with other disabled guys?

18:29.160 --> 18:32.180
-What's your shoe size?
-Thirty-seven.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.180
Mine is...

18:34.200 --> 18:36.109
forty-two.

18:36.130 --> 18:41.200
What does it feel like
carrying our baby?

18:42.170 --> 18:45.069
-Can I touch it?
-Sure you can.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.059
Hiya.

18:53.109 --> 18:55.200
Listen, María...

18:55.220 --> 18:57.029
Do you want to?

18:57.049 --> 19:00.029
-Do I want to what?
-Bring him up in religion?

19:00.049 --> 19:01.029
No.

19:01.049 --> 19:03.069
Neither do I.

19:03.089 --> 19:05.069
Are you allergic to anything?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.130
I am.

19:06.150 --> 19:07.150
Oh, yeah?

19:07.220 --> 19:09.099
To papaverine.

19:09.119 --> 19:11.150
It's a drug that's no longer
used,

19:11.170 --> 19:15.019
but if they gave it to me,
it could be dangerous.

19:15.150 --> 19:16.200
Say it.

19:17.069 --> 19:19.089
-Huh?
-Papaverine.

19:19.109 --> 19:20.150
Papaverine.

19:20.170 --> 19:22.089
Yeah, papaverine.

19:22.109 --> 19:24.069
-All right, are we done?
-No, no.

19:24.140 --> 19:27.119
Now you have to tell me
all about your childhood.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.210
Okay.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.009
The petrol station!

19:32.029 --> 19:33.230
He said the second
after the roundabout.

19:34.009 --> 19:36.220
If we're on a dirt track,
where do you think it leads?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.190
He said it was quicker this way.

19:38.210 --> 19:42.049
-The GPS says it's the other
way...
-The GPS has no idea!

19:42.069 --> 19:43.230
All right, forget it.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.009
Is that the car?

19:58.130 --> 20:01.009
Crap, crap!

20:23.130 --> 20:26.180
Jesus, I'm his dad.
Why doesn't he pick up?

20:32.230 --> 20:35.190
Because he wants to deal with it
himself.

20:37.089 --> 20:40.210
Gari isn't a kid anymore.
He's 32.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.089
Wasn't that
what we were working towards?

20:45.019 --> 20:46.200
So he could be independent.

20:48.140 --> 20:52.200
Dealing with this responsibly
and courageously

20:53.190 --> 20:56.220
is bloody amazing for a person
with his disability.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.049
And that's thanks to you.

21:00.180 --> 21:02.140
You should feel proud.

21:03.140 --> 21:05.150
Of him and of yourself.

21:10.119 --> 21:12.200
Having a kid is too much for
him.

21:14.059 --> 21:17.000
Having a kid can be too much
for anyone.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.160
Don't you think so?

22:07.039 --> 22:09.059
SEND A SMILE!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.109
Hang on, dude.
Wait, wait.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.210
-What?
-I need to pee.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.140
-Seriously? Now?
-Yeah.

22:53.160 --> 22:56.079
-Bloody hell!
-I've had five beers.

22:56.150 --> 22:59.099
-I'll be right back.
-Don't be long.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.210
Yeah, right.
Bloody hell.

23:29.150 --> 23:30.180
Here I am.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.220
What?

23:37.089 --> 23:38.150
What's up?

23:42.000 --> 23:42.210
Latin?

23:42.230 --> 23:44.059
You're nosey, dude.

23:44.079 --> 23:45.140
So...

23:46.180 --> 23:49.130
-What are you doing?
-Driving you home. Just what I
needed.

23:49.150 --> 23:51.180
If the police stop me, I'm
screwed.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.170
But it's not illegal at 17!

23:53.190 --> 23:56.079
And besides, I turn 18 in
October.

23:57.089 --> 23:59.109
You can't go around fooling
people.

23:59.200 --> 24:03.160
Everyone lies online.
Like you're really 35?

24:06.220 --> 24:10.119
What does it matter: 24 or 17?

24:12.099 --> 24:13.130
It's illegal.

24:14.059 --> 24:15.150
It's not illegal.

24:20.180 --> 24:22.029
Okay, it's not illegal.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.210
It's not illegal.

24:26.190 --> 24:28.029
It's not illegal.

24:29.140 --> 24:30.220
It's not illegal.

24:32.210 --> 24:33.190
It's not illegal!

24:34.109 --> 24:35.180
It's not illegal!

24:37.160 --> 24:40.039
And then I joined Jardinarte.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.109
And after that, I met you...

24:43.160 --> 24:45.000
and got you pregnant.

24:46.029 --> 24:47.079
End of story.

24:47.190 --> 24:48.200
Fine.

24:50.210 --> 24:52.210
-Did you like it?
-I liked it a lot.

24:52.230 --> 24:56.000
-We've become close in one
afternoon.
-Yeah.

24:56.140 --> 24:58.000
And I'm glad.

24:58.019 --> 25:00.039
Now we know
a lot of things about each
other.

25:00.059 --> 25:01.160
I feel much better.

25:04.059 --> 25:06.220
Great. I'm really glad, María.

25:12.079 --> 25:13.230
Well, actually, no.

25:14.210 --> 25:16.220
No? Why not?

25:17.109 --> 25:18.099
Because...

25:18.119 --> 25:19.180
Is it my fault?

25:19.200 --> 25:20.170
No, no.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.019
-Oh.
-No, no.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.000
This is a bit weird, isn't it?

25:26.220 --> 25:29.220
We're going to have a baby
and we hardly know each other.

25:30.079 --> 25:35.170
A moment ago you said that now
we know more stuff about each
other.

25:36.150 --> 25:38.119
Yes, all right. But...

25:39.019 --> 25:40.140
Actually...

25:44.039 --> 25:45.130
I don't know.

25:46.059 --> 25:48.059
Didn't you picture having a
child

25:48.079 --> 25:50.130
with someone
who would be your partner?

25:51.140 --> 25:53.119
I guess so, sure.

25:53.140 --> 25:55.140
Sure, right?

25:55.210 --> 25:57.130
It's what people imagine.

25:57.220 --> 26:00.109
Don't you think
that maybe we should be a
couple?

26:02.069 --> 26:03.200
I'm not saying we have to be
one,

26:03.220 --> 26:06.049
but maybe you thought
it was the ideal situation.

26:06.069 --> 26:10.200
-I did, a little bit.
-Yeah, I thought about it as
well.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.069
But I don't want to.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.170
-Why not?
-Because of stuff.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.109
-What stuff?
-Things.

26:18.049 --> 26:19.140
Tell me what they are.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.180
Dunno.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.150
What things?

26:25.089 --> 26:26.099
Like...

26:28.170 --> 26:29.190
I don't fancy you.

26:31.099 --> 26:33.190
-How come you don't fancy me?
-Like...

26:34.230 --> 26:36.210
I don't think you're pretty.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.130
What?

26:42.220 --> 26:46.069
I don't think you're pretty.

26:46.089 --> 26:49.099
-Sorry.
-No need to be sorry.

26:49.119 --> 26:50.089
Oh, okay.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.130
I wasn't asking you to go out
with me.

26:53.150 --> 26:55.180
-Really?
-No, I was just being honest.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.180
Oh, okay.

26:56.200 --> 26:59.029
Not saying I'd like to be your
girlfriend.

26:59.049 --> 27:01.069
No, I didn't mean that. I
mean...

27:04.029 --> 27:05.109
Why don't you think I'm pretty?

27:08.069 --> 27:10.049
Can we go now?

27:10.069 --> 27:12.220
Yes, but you have to tell me
why you think I'm not.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.069
Okay, okay.

27:14.089 --> 27:16.049
-Can we...
-You slept with me, remember?

27:16.069 --> 27:19.069
Because I'd been drinking, let's
go.

27:20.009 --> 27:20.210
Yes, okay.

27:21.029 --> 27:25.009
And I was drugged when we did
it.
Don't get the idea that...

27:25.230 --> 27:27.089
-You know?
-Right...

27:27.109 --> 27:29.160
-No one's perfect.
-All right...

27:31.140 --> 27:33.049
Why don't you like me
physically?

27:33.069 --> 27:35.119
Because you have bulging eyes.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.170
I have nice eyes.
Lots of people say so.

27:37.190 --> 27:40.059
All right, your nose is a bit
weird.

27:41.059 --> 27:45.000
And so because someone
has a weird nose they're not
pretty?

27:45.019 --> 27:47.049
-You talk...
-As if a nose is all there is.

27:47.069 --> 27:49.059
All right, you talk a lot.

27:49.079 --> 27:51.160
Right, because I like chatting.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.200
Yeah, okay.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.059
Your nose isn't exactly...

27:55.079 --> 27:56.160
-Is it this way?
-That way.

27:59.150 --> 28:02.210
If you get hungry or thirsty,

28:02.230 --> 28:05.180
-you know where the kitchen is,
right?
-Yeah, okay.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.170
Good night, then.

28:09.099 --> 28:10.130
Good night.

28:14.039 --> 28:15.089
Papaverine.

28:16.130 --> 28:17.150
What?

28:19.089 --> 28:20.160
Your allergy.

28:26.119 --> 28:27.160
See you in the morning.

28:27.180 --> 28:29.049
See you in the morning.

28:44.069 --> 28:46.210
You have 34 new messages.

28:46.230 --> 28:48.140
Last message.

28:50.150 --> 28:51.200
Hi, it's me again.

28:51.220 --> 28:54.160
I know I've been a bit of a pain
today.

28:55.140 --> 28:59.049
I just wanted to say I love
you...

28:59.069 --> 29:01.049
and trust you.

29:01.210 --> 29:04.009
Okay, bye. Let's talk soon.

29:56.210 --> 29:58.029
Fuck!

30:12.059 --> 30:14.130
NOCTURNAL
PERFUMED

30:22.119 --> 30:23.200
EMOTIONAL PARALYSIS

30:45.000 --> 30:46.140
-Mery.
-What?

30:46.160 --> 30:48.009
Are you awake?

30:48.029 --> 30:48.220
Yes.

30:54.230 --> 30:56.210
I still didn't tell them.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.180
Don't worry, you will.

31:01.099 --> 31:03.079
Do you think I have a weird
nose?

31:03.099 --> 31:04.109
Come off it!

31:05.119 --> 31:07.109
You have an Aguado nose.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.210
How so?

31:08.230 --> 31:11.039
It's not important.

31:11.059 --> 31:13.180
Can I touch your belly to relax?

31:13.200 --> 31:14.210
Sure.

31:16.220 --> 31:18.079
Hi, Juanito.

31:18.099 --> 31:19.180
Don't call him Juanito.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.049
-It's not his name.
-What do you want me to call
him?

31:22.069 --> 31:24.079
Whatever you want,
but I don't like Juanito.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.109
-Hi, little foetus.
-Not that, either.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.180
-God, what then?
-Well...

31:29.029 --> 31:31.170
-Nephew.
-Juanito.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.000
Hey, he moved!

31:36.170 --> 31:38.190
-I've got wind.
-You bastard!

32:04.170 --> 32:06.220
One with onion for my
sweetheart.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.140
And another without.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.190
For your sister.

32:09.210 --> 32:10.220
Thanks.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.220
-Morning.
-Hi.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.029
-Where have you been?
-I went jogging.

32:15.049 --> 32:18.039
-Since when do you go jogging?
-Since I quit going to mass.

32:18.059 --> 32:19.210
Father Carlos asked after you.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.130
What did you tell him?

32:21.150 --> 32:23.019
That you wanted to apostatise.

32:23.039 --> 32:24.069
-Perfect.
-Want some?

32:24.089 --> 32:25.089
Yes, please.

32:26.230 --> 32:28.200
I slept like a log.

32:29.230 --> 32:31.220
I love this painting.
