WEBVTT

01:45.064 --> 01:46.274
Mon capitaine!

01:53.072 --> 01:55.324
Orders from headquarters, sir

02:17.763 --> 02:19.203
The orders...

02:20.808 --> 02:21.851
Are to attack the bridge.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.980
We can expect heavy casualties.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.400
No-one will reach that bridge alive.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.112
Find your nerve, men.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.156
We risk our lives

02:35.448 --> 02:37.074
but we can take back our home!

02:38.326 --> 02:41.662
For centuries,
poets have dreamt of dying for love.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.082
I suppose we shall be the lucky ones.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.754
The orders are to wait three hours
for the wind to turn east

02:50.296 --> 02:52.757
then fire every gas canister we have.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.804
There is an alternative, captain.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.978
What is it, poirot?

03:07.271 --> 03:08.647
We attack right now.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.690
Now?

03:09.857 --> 03:10.566
Yes.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.777
Within the next seven minutes.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.277
Perhaps eight.

03:15.988 --> 03:16.655
Every morning

03:16.822 --> 03:18.199
the petrels take flight

03:18.532 --> 03:21.077
just before the wind turns east.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.577
You see?

03:23.579 --> 03:24.579
This morning

03:24.622 --> 03:26.248
they fly early.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.126
The wind conditions are ideal now

03:29.919 --> 03:31.921
to hide our advance.

03:32.838 --> 03:33.672
Hidden by the gas

03:33.839 --> 03:37.635
we will cross 200 metres of no man's land
without being seen.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.512
Before the enemy even knows

03:39.678 --> 03:41.347
that we attack!

03:41.680 --> 03:44.600
If you're wrong, the wind will blow the
gas back on the rest of our army.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.103
We gas ourselves as they kill us,
that's what you want?

03:48.145 --> 03:49.355
I am not wrong.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.395
It's an ambush.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.403
I can't see them.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.161
Retreat!

05:04.054 --> 05:05.854
You were right!

05:06.140 --> 05:09.477
You are too sharp to be a farmer, poirot.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.481
Non! Capitaine!

05:45.221 --> 05:47.598
I asked you not to come.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.437
I'm a nurse, too.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.900
I heard there was a wounded soldier

05:58.067 --> 06:01.529
whose instincts on the battlefield
saved his entire company.

06:03.781 --> 06:06.283
I did not save my captain.

06:09.036 --> 06:13.123
And you agreed to marry me
before all of this.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.711
Katherine, you should go.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.422
Do you have any idea how love works?

06:22.091 --> 06:24.176
When you love someone, you love them

06:24.552 --> 06:28.681
through all their moods
and changes over time.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.809
Their worst qualities peak at nuisance.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.853
Their flaws become freckles.

06:37.273 --> 06:38.941
And as it happens...

06:41.652 --> 06:42.987
I love you.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.698
What about this?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.920
Come here.

07:08.304 --> 07:09.430
Simple.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.727
You'll grow a moustache.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.727
Poirot! Where you been?

07:56.894 --> 07:58.771
The arundell mystery?
Are you "with case"?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.189
No, I am with hunger.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.733
Monsieur blondin!

08:02.900 --> 08:05.319
Monsieur poirot, you solved the case
in Egypt.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.126
It was a great success.
But I must return.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.781
And tonight is gonna be...

08:09.156 --> 08:10.157
Merci, monsieur.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.118
One of every dessert on the menu
is on its way.

08:13.285 --> 08:16.747
Anything else Mr. Poirot wants, just ask.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.670
The whole house is wondering
why there's no music.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.464
There's no music
because no money's been paid.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.675
I pay everyone at the end of the night.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.468
Well, in my experience,

08:29.635 --> 08:34.097
men who run such upright,
quality establishments like yours,

08:34.264 --> 08:36.933
lose their wallets when the bill comes.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.436
I'm betting you already forgot my name.

08:39.977 --> 08:40.979
Rosalie otterbourne.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.191
I'm not just salome otterbourne's manager,
I'm her niece.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.944
She'll retire wealthy,
and I'll see to that.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.905
And we get paid up front.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.282
So if you want a little music,

08:52.449 --> 08:53.909
first, I wanna see a stack of green

08:53.992 --> 08:55.744
or whatever color money is
in your country.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.086
You remember my name now.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.633
Blondin: Ladies and gentlemen!

09:09.717 --> 09:11.677
Salome otterbourne!

09:40.497 --> 09:45.085
I wanna tell you the natural facts

09:46.086 --> 09:49.757
that a man don't understand
the good book right

09:49.923 --> 09:52.009
and that's all

09:55.554 --> 09:57.556
That's all -

09:59.099 --> 10:02.352
You know what?
We got to have more love

10:02.519 --> 10:05.814
more understanding every day of our lives

10:05.981 --> 10:07.858
and that's all

10:11.403 --> 10:14.406
now when you see folks jump

10:15.491 --> 10:18.035
from this or that

10:18.118 --> 10:22.122
They don't know, they don't know
where in the devil they're at

10:22.289 --> 10:24.458
and that's all

10:44.228 --> 10:48.440
Listen, people fighting one another

10:48.607 --> 10:51.276
and think they're doing swell

10:51.443 --> 10:54.279
and all they want is your money

10:54.446 --> 10:57.741
and you can go to...
And that's all

11:02.204 --> 11:03.622
that's all

11:06.959 --> 11:12.256
y'all got to have religion

11:12.339 --> 11:16.009
I tell ya, that's all

11:18.679 --> 11:20.055
Reporter 1: Miss ridgeway!

11:23.392 --> 11:24.393
Reporter 2: Linnet!

11:25.686 --> 11:27.126
Miss ridgeway!
Miss ridgeway, please!

11:27.229 --> 11:28.373
Reporter 1:
Come on, give us a smile!

11:28.397 --> 11:30.566
Reporter 2: Miss ridgeway!
Reporter 1: Give us a smile!

11:30.732 --> 11:33.235
Guard: Stand back, please.
Make way for miss ridgeway.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.530
Up above my head

11:36.697 --> 11:37.948
female chorus: Up above my head

11:38.115 --> 11:39.867
I hear music in the air

12:02.764 --> 12:04.242
Miss linnet ridgeway,

12:04.266 --> 12:05.893
I can't tell you what an honor it is.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.855
Merci. We have the... there are seven.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.648
Indeed. Seven of the very finest, sir.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.525
I do not want seven.
I want only the six.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.028
I cannot have, uh, the uneven number.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.238
Ah, now we have the even number.
This is good.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.005
Which should I take away? I do not know.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.218
No, not my little friend, please.
Thank you so much.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.368
Thank you very, very much.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.329
It is, you see, my little...

12:27.915 --> 12:29.541
Linnet.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.921
It's not fair looking like that
and getting to be you.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.466
Oh, well, I asked Louise to pick out
something special to see my Jacks.

12:37.633 --> 12:38.800
It's been ages.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.263
Engaged?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.059
- I know.
- But who?

12:47.351 --> 12:51.605
He's big, and square, and boyish,
and beautifully simple.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.441
And that's it.
He's called Simon to drive the point.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.026
Simon Doyle.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.921
We're desperate to be married
as soon as possible.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.321
That's why I wanted to see you.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.989
You're not...

13:01.490 --> 13:03.325
What? No, no.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.410
- But we have sex a lot.
- Shh...

13:05.494 --> 13:06.495
- Constantly.
- Jackie!

13:06.578 --> 13:07.746
Sorry, it's true.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.832
Honestly, I'll die
if I can't be Mrs. Doyle.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.417
It's love.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.211
Oh, if it's money you need,

13:14.378 --> 13:15.587
call it a wedding gift.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.924
No. Not money. Ajob.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.926
You bought that new estate.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.553
You'll need someone
to fix it up for you and run it.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.764
You could give the job to Simon.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.867
He's unemployed.
But he's country through and through.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.851
And he knows all about estates, I swear.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.437
If he doesn't make good,
axe him on the spot.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.898
But he will.
He's too spectacular to fail.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.316
Oh, darling.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.112
You got it so bad. Be careful.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.279
It's too late.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.614
Simon: Jackie, darling.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.241
Here he is.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.623
Mm, that was naughty of me.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.001
Hello.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.004
I hope you don't mind, I took the Liberty.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.925
Simon, darling, meet the golden girl.
As advertised.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.886
The divine linnet ridgeway.

14:06.013 --> 14:09.141
Pleased to meet my new land agent.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.351
Do you really mean that?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.025
Of course she does.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.860
Take her to the dance floor, silly.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.570
Go and thank her properly.

14:39.921 --> 14:44.593
Now won't you hear me singing

14:44.760 --> 14:48.096
hear the words that I'm saying

14:48.638 --> 14:53.351
wash my soul with water from on high

14:55.729 --> 14:57.814
while the world of love

14:57.898 --> 15:00.067
ls around me

15:00.817 --> 15:04.196
evil thoughts do bind me

15:04.362 --> 15:07.574
but, oh, if you leave me

15:07.949 --> 15:10.243
I will die

15:12.037 --> 15:16.208
you had me in thou bosom

15:16.374 --> 15:20.754
till the storms of life is over

15:20.921 --> 15:22.839
rock me

15:23.006 --> 15:26.468
in a cradle of thou love

15:28.970 --> 15:30.639
only feed

15:37.229 --> 15:39.272
Then you take me

15:39.439 --> 15:43.443
to your blessed home above

15:53.620 --> 15:57.916
Blondin: Let's hear it one more time
for salome otterbourne.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.528
Monsieur?

17:11.239 --> 17:13.325
Monsieur, alors! Monsieur!

17:14.159 --> 17:17.454
You are defiling
one of the wonders of the world!

17:17.954 --> 17:20.373
And also, by the way,
ruining a sublime Jaffa cake!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.708
Monsieur!

17:26.421 --> 17:30.217
Man: You beautiful kite!

17:39.726 --> 17:41.853
What? Poirot!

17:42.020 --> 17:43.063
Bouc!

17:43.230 --> 17:45.190
What are you doing here?

17:45.357 --> 17:48.151
What do you think about my kite?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.112
I'll come down. Stay there.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.197
Poirot: Be careful.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.242
Bouc: Of all the pyramids
in all the world,

17:55.408 --> 17:58.578
you had to walk up to mine.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.247
What a small world.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.333
Poirot: Mon ami, bouc!

18:03.875 --> 18:06.127
Why would you fly a kite on the pyramids?

18:06.294 --> 18:07.462
Because no one ever has!

18:07.629 --> 18:10.048
Thousands of years,
right here, and I'm the first!

18:10.215 --> 18:11.424
You are the first.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.469
Poirot, it is good to see you.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.888
Are you on an exotic holiday
or an exotic case?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.140
Cases, I am in hiding from cases.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.643
Well, if you want to hide,
come and hide with us.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.937
In assouan. We're on a whirlwind tour.

18:24.104 --> 18:26.314
Still the constant traveler.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.857
Mm. Sadly, no.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.944
Uncle sacked me off the train
once he found out that I did nothing.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.862
I tried jobs. An office.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.532
I could manage the work,
I just couldn't fathom mornings.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.701
But I've made ends meet as a kept man.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.494
Come!

18:39.577 --> 18:41.329
Come. I shall introduce you to euphemia.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.497
But who is euphemia?

18:42.664 --> 18:43.784
Bouc: Well, you'll find out.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.675
Poirot: A new young lady
in the life of bouc?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.751
A new name to me.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.671
Bouc: Well, behind every kite-flying man,
there is a woman.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.385
Here she is.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.346
The only woman I have ever loved...
Mother.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.432
Mother, you must meet hercule poirot.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.143
- Why?
- He's only the greatest detective alive.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.562
Oh, he exaggerates.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.105
No, he is quite correct, actually.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.025
You are quite the most ludicrous man
I have ever seen.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.377
Not the first time I've heard this.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.194
- And you're in my view.
- Stepping aside.

19:13.361 --> 19:17.198
Be kind, mother.
Poirot here is my friend, and he's famous.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.676
And he's joining our dinner tonight.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.452
- Is he?
- I cannot intrude.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.746
Oh, no, not at all.
You bump my stock at the table.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.599
It's not just mother and I on holiday,
we're celebrating with friends.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.417
It's a wedding party.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.003
Ooh. Is that me?

19:30.587 --> 19:32.255
Might be.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.548
Be nice.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.065
Excuse me.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.046
Man: "Should have
entire situation managed,

20:13.213 --> 20:16.299
"then back to business as usual."

20:17.384 --> 20:19.761
Do you have all of that? Good.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.556
Now, please see this telegram
sent off as soon as able.

20:24.182 --> 20:28.144
And not another soul sees it.

20:30.188 --> 20:31.731
No! I'll do it!

20:31.898 --> 20:36.111
It's bad enough we have to stay
in this bourgeois nightmare of a hotel,

20:36.653 --> 20:41.074
but I won't be party
to the oppression of the working class.

20:41.241 --> 20:45.453
Unless it's me, of course.
Then she's perfectly fine with it.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.164
I am calm, capable, and coping.

20:52.961 --> 20:53.962
Dignity.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.802
Woman: Marie Van schuyler.
And I don't need a suite.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.804
It's just me
and my nurse bowers.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.806
I'm Mrs. Doyle's godmother.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.641
We do have reservations.

21:06.808 --> 21:09.102
And will this area be cleared
for the party?

21:09.269 --> 21:12.856
We don't wantjust anybody hanging around
and stealing the champagne.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.360
Is it very expensive?

21:18.778 --> 21:20.029
Merci.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.021
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

21:36.045 --> 21:38.205
we are closing this reception
area for a wedding party.

21:38.256 --> 21:39.757
Everything fine, madame?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.627
It's perfect.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.700
Marie: The cost of this party
could feed a village for a year.

21:47.724 --> 21:48.884
It's an obscene extravagance.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.102
I know. Wonderful, isn't it?

21:51.269 --> 21:55.607
Is it true you donated your entire fortune
to the socialist party, dear?

21:55.773 --> 21:56.816
Communist.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.737
"Money is the alienated essence
of man's labor and life."

22:00.904 --> 22:03.281
Money is the only friend
a woman can rely on.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.844
Bowers: Look at this!

22:04.908 --> 22:07.452
Ladies and gentlemen. And mother.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.622
It is my honor to introduce our hosts.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.081
Please welcome the newlyweds,

22:12.457 --> 22:15.793
Mr. and Mrs. Simon Doyle!

22:16.461 --> 22:18.880
Marie: There they are!

22:21.674 --> 22:23.551
Louise: Magnifique, madame!

22:24.761 --> 22:27.138
Marie: Fantastic, linny!
Bouc: Beautiful!

22:29.891 --> 22:31.476
Ah, love.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.270
It is not safe.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.774
I bore witness to a small drama
some weeks ago.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.109
Clearly, I caught only the first act.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.070
Marie: Like an angel, linny!

22:42.529 --> 22:43.655
Lucky devil.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.908
Fancy finding the one heiress
without adenoids and flat feet.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.493
Eloped as fast as they could.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.900
Euphemia: Convention be damned.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.996
Bowers: Married for love
and got money by chance,

22:52.080 --> 22:53.390
that's the lightning strike.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.166
Three cheers and a tiger from me!

22:56.334 --> 22:57.377
How do I look?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.254
Like a million dollars.

22:59.420 --> 23:00.505
Mm, make that two million.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.549
Oh, my wedding gift from Simon.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.884
Yes, paid for
with her account, so, hardly.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.636
Her gift to her via me.

23:09.347 --> 23:13.309
I was sure bouc was fibbing
when he said he knew the hercule poirot.

23:13.643 --> 23:14.894
Enchantée, monsieur.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.105
My congratulations
and my gratitude, madame.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.566
Merci. Ladies. Godmother.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.610
Cousin Andrew!

23:24.571 --> 23:25.738
Simon.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.033
Cousin Andrew, my trustee
for all ridgeway affairs,

23:29.117 --> 23:30.118
abroad and domestic.

23:30.285 --> 23:32.036
He's practically family.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.123
I made him come
so he'd take a vacation for once.

23:35.290 --> 23:38.126
I'm only here for the champagne,
sacred honor.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.920
Andrew: And for this...

23:43.548 --> 23:44.549
Oh.

23:45.717 --> 23:46.917
Euphemia: Oh, that's so sweet!

23:49.345 --> 23:50.763
Isn't it adorable?

23:51.806 --> 23:56.311
Friends, I know you're all thinking
there is a mystery at play here.

23:56.477 --> 24:01.399
The case of "why in the hell
would linnet ridgeway marry him?"

24:01.482 --> 24:03.401
And I honestly can't say why.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.404
I'm not smart or romantic.

24:06.946 --> 24:10.116
I don't have the words, or the money,
or the pedigree.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.160
But I do love you.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.996
And now...

24:16.247 --> 24:20.668
Well, I don't even want to say it,
lest the thieves come and steal you away.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.378
To the bride and groom.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.297
Guests: Bride and groom.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.677
Bouc: Three cheers!
Bowers: Three cheers!

24:29.844 --> 24:32.639
Simon: Salome otterbourne
sang the night we met.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.766
So, I begged your old pal, Rosalie,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.352
to beg her to travel with us.

24:37.518 --> 24:38.728
I wouldn't have missed it.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.522
Bowers: I haven't tasted caviar
in 10 years.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.775
What a decadent display of wealth.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.153
Simon: Come on, linny, let's dance.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.198
Bouc: Ah, the bereaved.

24:50.365 --> 24:51.765
There's one at every wedding party.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.948
The good doctor windlesham proposed
to miss ridgeway

24:53.993 --> 24:55.703
when she was still miss ridgeway.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.373
He and the papers
both had the deal as good as done.

24:58.706 --> 25:02.335
Then came the engorged stallion,
and now it's Mrs. Doyle.

25:02.502 --> 25:06.005
If I were in his shoes, I'd only come here
to put a bullet in the groom.

25:06.172 --> 25:10.426
Our other guests, linnet's godmother,
who despises linnet's wealth,

25:10.593 --> 25:12.970
and the godmother's nursemaid,
bowers, who covets it,

25:13.137 --> 25:14.806
as does linnet's own maid,

25:14.889 --> 25:16.200
poor old Louise.

25:16.224 --> 25:18.935
Oh, and there's cousin Andrew.
He's a slippery fish.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.770
No one except linnet trusts him.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.898
We find mother and I
are the only sane people here.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.402
The only one who seems
to like linnet at all

25:27.485 --> 25:28.945
is her old schoolmate, Rosalie.

25:29.112 --> 25:31.239
And she's salome otterbourne's niece

25:31.322 --> 25:33.050
and arranged for her
to come to play for them.

25:33.074 --> 25:34.343
Woman: Monsieur poirot,
come and dance.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.368
Bouc: Oh. Good luck.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.203
Rock me

25:37.370 --> 25:40.415
in a cradle of thou love

25:40.498 --> 25:42.976
euphemia: Looking good, Simon!
Simon: Come, everyone! Let's go!

25:43.000 --> 25:44.001
Come on.

25:44.168 --> 25:48.506
Salome: Only feed me

25:48.673 --> 25:51.259
Till I want no more

25:51.426 --> 25:53.302
then you take me

25:53.469 --> 25:57.348
to your blessed home above

26:18.244 --> 26:19.996
Linnet: She's followed us again.

26:22.331 --> 26:23.791
I'm sorry.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.427
Alas, act three.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.888
Turns out there's two bereaved
at every party.

26:43.728 --> 26:44.729
How's linnet?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.757
No, no. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Yeah, very nice.

27:24.477 --> 27:25.478
Try a piece.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.947
Oh, very nice.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.434
Oh, look at those boxes in there.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.492
- He's here.
- Who is?

27:39.659 --> 27:40.743
Poirot.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.429
Simon: Well, then let's speak to him.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.497
Excuse me. Excuse me.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.998
The snake is your friend, eh?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.084
My best friend.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.377
Monsieur poirot.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.295
Sorry about the high drama last night.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.182
Do think about giving us
another go tonight.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.757
You are much too kind to strangers.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.947
Simon: Careful! Careful!

27:59.470 --> 28:00.471
Thank you.

28:00.555 --> 28:01.824
Poirot: Madame.
Snake handler: So sorry!

28:01.848 --> 28:02.932
I go. I go.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.976
You all right?

28:06.102 --> 28:07.937
Mr. and Mrs. Doyle, I'm so sorry.

28:08.104 --> 28:10.398
Simon: Actually, poirot,
we wanted to ask for your help.

28:11.065 --> 28:12.692
It's, uh, Jackie de bellefort.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.069
She's followed us
every step of our honeymoon.

28:15.820 --> 28:19.532
She and I...
We were engaged, you see.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.536
Has she made any specific threats?

28:23.703 --> 28:27.707
No, she doesn't say a thing.
She only shows up, and sits, and stares.

28:27.790 --> 28:28.875
Poirot: Pardonnez-moi, non.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.669
There is no case for me to accept.
She has committed no crime.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.716
It's indecent, what she's doing.
And melodramatic.

28:36.799 --> 28:39.343
And she's making an ass of herself
is what it is.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.306
See, when I was with Jackie,
I liked her, I did.

28:43.931 --> 28:47.852
Then I met linnet.
Jackie just didn't exist for me anymore.

28:49.353 --> 28:53.649
From "hello," I just couldn't imagine
any other path but by her side.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.651
And lucky me, she felt the same.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.195
I could've punched the sun.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.823
Hmm. Instead, you broke your engagement.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.578
Does he have to spend the rest of his life
with someone he doesn't love

29:05.661 --> 29:07.371
to spare her feelings?

29:07.663 --> 29:09.665
It's love.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.960
It's not a game played fair.
There are no rules.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.547
Now, maybe she hasn't
committed a crime yet.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.841
But I know Jackie, she will.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.719
She always settled her scores.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.098
Do think about it.

29:42.156 --> 29:43.282
Poirot: Mademoiselle.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.450
Do I know you?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.578
If you will permit me
a little moment to talk with you?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.247
Of course.

29:50.748 --> 29:52.124
Here it comes.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.188
Linnet paid a detective a bucket of money
to knock me off her tail.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.589
She kindly offered, I politely declined.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.549
Boo-hoo.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.356
Madame is used to getting what she wants.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.887
Her father was halfway to a gangster.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.734
You have known madame Doyle for some time?

30:08.099 --> 30:09.767
We met doing the school play.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.853
Antony and Cleopatra.

30:14.897 --> 30:15.982
I was Cleopatra,

30:16.148 --> 30:17.793
until the teacher came
a week before opening

30:17.817 --> 30:19.694
and decided to give my part to linnet.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.238
I was stuck with charmian, the handmaid.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.449
You have our newlyweds in the twist.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.413
First, I did it just to be near him.

30:30.830 --> 30:34.500
Then I got bold, and let them see me.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.752
I saw her smile fade

30:37.294 --> 30:38.879
and lines crack across her forehead.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.173
Mademoiselle de bellefort,
you must give this up.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.802
What is done is done.
Bitterness will not undo it.

30:44.969 --> 30:46.971
He is married.
He is in love with his wife.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.514
Simon loves me.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.058
Simon loves me.

30:51.809 --> 30:52.810
I know it.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.439
Even if he's forgotten, dazzled by her.

30:57.440 --> 30:59.900
Love that fierce doesn't vanish.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.821
I love him.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.658
I love him madly,
badly, at every minute.

31:08.159 --> 31:10.578
It's not something
I can switch off.

31:15.666 --> 31:18.586
There's a reason the heart is the organ
given to love, you know.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.007
If it stops to rest, we die.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.094
And I won't die alone,

31:28.012 --> 31:29.972
you can be sure of that.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.644
It's a .22 caliber.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.650
It's practically a toy.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.905
Maybe, to fix a broken heart,

31:46.072 --> 31:48.491
all it takes is a single bullet.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.081
Simon: Damn her.

31:55.748 --> 31:58.000
All right. What would you have us do?
Try the police?

31:58.167 --> 32:00.377
Well, if I may humbly advise?

32:01.295 --> 32:03.631
I am sure Mrs. Doyle has a fine home.

32:03.798 --> 32:05.633
Go to it now.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.136
Build your nest,
begin your lives together.

32:10.346 --> 32:12.264
We could, Simon.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.184
We could go home and shut the gates.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.520
We could be happy.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.647
What, just pack it in?

32:20.147 --> 32:21.649
But what about our honeymoon?

32:21.816 --> 32:24.610
Consider it the cost of love.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.280
And a bargain at that, huh?

32:29.198 --> 32:30.533
Bonne nuit.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.951
Merci.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.928
This way. Don't dawdle.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.763
- What's the scam here, Simon?
- Hurry on.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.473
I thought we were sightseeing today?

32:54.640 --> 32:57.518
Yes, I know I invited you
for another 10 days

32:57.601 --> 32:59.019
sightseeing in assouan to philae,

32:59.186 --> 33:02.064
but circumstances invited inspiration.

33:02.231 --> 33:05.067
So, like Moses, not far from here,

33:05.234 --> 33:07.945
we have made a surprise turn at the water.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.282
- After all, I couldn't refuse...
- What?

33:11.740 --> 33:14.368
The queen of the nile.

33:29.592 --> 33:33.762
"I have immortal longings in me."

33:33.929 --> 33:35.431
B ravo!

33:40.895 --> 33:43.189
Bowers: It is gorgeous!

33:43.355 --> 33:45.275
Bouc: Mother, why don't
we have a boat like that?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.776
Marie: You got too much money, linnet.
Not enough sense.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.737
Bowers: But great taste in boats!

33:53.782 --> 33:54.783
See?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.911
I told you it'd all be fine.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.706
Jackie won't be able to follow us anymore.

34:01.665 --> 34:02.791
Let's go.

34:03.918 --> 34:05.038
All right, everybody aboard!

34:45.251 --> 34:46.793
Simon: Permission to come aboard.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.015
Oh, wow! It's beautiful.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.268
You look so happy.
You deserve it.

35:12.987 --> 35:16.323
We have the karnak all to ourselves
until abu simbel.

35:16.490 --> 35:19.535
Don't worry about your things,
darling Louise will go back

35:19.702 --> 35:22.746
and pack up all your rooms for you
and meet us at shellal.

35:22.830 --> 35:23.831
Happy to, miss.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.194
Bowers: Thank you.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.875
We have a piano tuned,

35:27.042 --> 35:29.586
a chef stolen from shepheard's of Cairo,

35:29.753 --> 35:33.090
and enough champagne to fill the nile.

35:36.260 --> 35:37.303
Simon: Champagne!

35:37.386 --> 35:38.971
Euphemia: It's not even half ten.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.223
Then we're behind.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.975
Poirot: So, there is one more above, yes?

35:43.142 --> 35:45.060
Hello, Egypt.

36:11.045 --> 36:14.340
Bellhop: All luggage from the hotel
is going to the karnak.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.507
Monsieur Doyle.

36:15.591 --> 36:18.635
I need monsieur Doyle.
I need those three trunks there. Oui.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.060
I shall strike this like Joe DiMaggio.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.730
Bowers: Oh, completely useless.
Windlesham: Five, officer.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.690
- Make that a naught.
- Officer: Five points.

36:31.774 --> 36:32.983
Marie: Bowers, my love.

36:33.067 --> 36:34.818
Windlesham:
I'm winning by quite a margin.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.946
Well done.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.948
Well,
that's the borderline, surely.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.450
- Huh?
- What's that, there?

36:41.617 --> 36:44.328
I'd say that's a grebe, isn't it?
Very beautiful.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.148
Bouc: You just moved my puck.
Windlesham: Foul shot.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.068
Simon: Bouc, that was a foul shot
and you know it. Take it again.

37:16.151 --> 37:17.736
Windlesham: You're a cheat. A swindler.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.822
Linnet, you've got cheats on board.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.783
Bowers and Van schuyler are cheats,
just like these two.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.246
Poirot: Katherine, mon amour.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.458
Linnet: Monsieur poirot,

37:31.625 --> 37:33.919
I hope you can forgive
my hijacking your holiday.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.506
Couldn't let you miss the fun.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.758
It is an honor.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.302
And it is convenient to my own plans.

37:42.469 --> 37:45.139
Although, travel by water
does not naturally agree with me.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.306
Oh, I could tell you...

37:46.390 --> 37:47.933
Well, I should not tell you, actually.

37:48.559 --> 37:50.686
But I suspect you perhaps may have

37:50.769 --> 37:53.063
included me for reasons
other than the fun.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.946
I wish we'd gone home like you said.

38:01.363 --> 38:03.699
- Ah.
- I don't feel safe here.

38:04.366 --> 38:07.077
Not me, not Simon, even with Jackie gone.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.871
But you are among friends.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.539
When you have money,

38:11.498 --> 38:13.459
no one is ever really your friend.

38:14.334 --> 38:19.673
Now I'm remembering
old jealousies and fights.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.926
It takes a pill to get to sleep.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.266
I don't feel safe with any of them.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.317
I hoped you might watch for us.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.116
Hmm.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.284
Thank you.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.310
Mm... now?

39:13.477 --> 39:14.561
And now.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.773
See? Completely normal.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.483
I'm so hot.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.443
Yes, you're in Egypt.

39:21.527 --> 39:22.528
Marie: It's malaria.

39:22.611 --> 39:23.851
Bowers: You don't have malaria.

39:23.904 --> 39:26.132
Marie: You know I have a temperature.
That thermometer is broken.

39:26.156 --> 39:27.356
Bowers: It's perfectly normal.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.409
- No, no, it's broken.
- No, it's not broken.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.573
Marie: Oh, I'm so hot.
Bowers: It's how it should be.

39:32.829 --> 39:33.997
I know, I know.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.167
Tactless to talk business
to a bride on her honeymoon.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.586
Bad lawyer. You promised.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.838
There's only a few quick signatures.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.758
Fair enough. My marriage has
made a difference, I'm sure.

39:44.925 --> 39:47.469
Do give us more notice next time.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.434
It... it's all quite straightfonnard.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.520
The ceylon land concession

39:56.687 --> 39:58.772
and the obvious changes to the new will.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.776
The lease of the London property.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.947
It's all quite straightfonivard.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.783
Linnet: I'm sorry, cousin, you know me.

40:09.950 --> 40:13.328
Never met a contract
I couldn't find some corrections.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.289
Papa taught me too well.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.374
Simon: Not me. That's not my way.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.501
I've never read a contract in my life.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.388
Any deal that can't be made
with a handshake

40:21.420 --> 40:22.629
just isn't for me.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.257
Go on, linny. Sign it.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.144
Sooner you do,
the sooner we can get to bed.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.180
You were the first girl who ever told me

40:32.347 --> 40:35.809
that a woman can run her affairs
as well as a man or better.

40:36.476 --> 40:39.271
Don't tell me that score changed
with one little husband.

40:44.318 --> 40:45.998
Linnet: Go get ready for the party, Simon.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.946
I promise I won't be too long.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.656
I'm being rude.

40:51.575 --> 40:52.576
It's no rush.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.411
Just kick it to tomorrow.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.543
Salome: Up above my head

41:01.627 --> 41:03.003
Rosalie: Up above my head

41:03.086 --> 41:05.714
salome: I hear music in the air
Rosalie: I hear music in the air

41:05.797 --> 41:08.508
salome: Now up above my head
Rosalie: Up above my head

41:08.592 --> 41:11.720
salome: You know I hear music in the air
Rosalie: I hear music in the air

41:11.803 --> 41:13.156
Up above my head

41:13.180 --> 41:14.181
up above my head

41:14.264 --> 41:17.351
salome: I hear music in the air
Rosalie: I hear music in the air

41:17.434 --> 41:20.145
salome: And I really do believe
Rosalie: Yes, lreally do believe

41:20.228 --> 41:21.623
salome and Rosalie:
There's a heaven somewhere

41:21.647 --> 41:22.648
heaven somewhere

41:22.731 --> 41:24.566
salome: Up above my head

41:24.650 --> 41:26.610
Rosalie: Up above my head
bouc: Come down, poirot.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.071
Salome: I see trouble in the air

41:29.237 --> 41:31.907
and I really do believe
that there's a heaven somewhere

41:32.074 --> 41:34.743
heaven somewhere

41:37.496 --> 41:38.997
Bloody good fun!

41:39.581 --> 41:41.667
Bra vissimo!

41:42.459 --> 41:43.877
Wonderful, as ever.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.170
Salome: Thank you.

41:48.465 --> 41:50.467
Madame, I am so moved.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.594
Your bluesy music
has joy on top for the dancing,

41:52.761 --> 41:54.554
yet there is tragedy in there, too.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.890
Writing tragedy is easy.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.810
I just imagine someone I wanna punish.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.187
Then I imagine them in love.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.735
You've, uh,

42:08.819 --> 42:12.072
taken quite a keen interest
in salome otterbourne.

42:12.239 --> 42:15.659
I thought poirot was impervious
to love's fever.

42:15.826 --> 42:18.286
I was sick with it once.

42:19.204 --> 42:22.165
It left me with enough regret
for a lifetime.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.294
There are many fine detectives.

42:26.378 --> 42:28.797
Well, that is not true.
There are many average detectives.

42:28.964 --> 42:30.716
But to be what I am,

42:30.882 --> 42:33.093
it requires fixedness of mind.

42:33.260 --> 42:36.138
The little grey cells pampered, indulged,

42:36.304 --> 42:38.265
given all the oxygen in my blood,

42:38.432 --> 42:40.767
and minutes on my clock.

42:40.934 --> 42:44.563
No, I leave the tempest of love to you.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.023
But what of the niece?

42:48.150 --> 42:49.818
A beguiling lady, no?

42:49.901 --> 42:51.069
Is she?

42:51.236 --> 42:53.780
A cool, methodical brain
of the highest order.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.657
She sings well, too.

42:55.949 --> 42:57.659
- Hmm?
- I hadn't noticed.

42:57.743 --> 43:00.787
She's, um, a schoolmate
of linnet's, I hear?

43:00.954 --> 43:02.748
You are trying to keep secrets from me?

43:02.914 --> 43:04.708
- From me? From me?
- What?

43:04.875 --> 43:07.878
Rosalie otterbourne
is an overtly beautiful woman,

43:08.044 --> 43:11.256
and bouc has not spoken to her once?

43:13.842 --> 43:16.011
It's nothing short of gobsmacked love!

43:16.178 --> 43:17.363
Look, I've been bursting to tell you.

43:17.387 --> 43:18.764
Linnet introduced us months ago

43:18.930 --> 43:21.534
and since then, there hasn't been
another woman I've wanted to look at

43:21.558 --> 43:23.935
except as a...
A nanny to our children.

43:24.102 --> 43:27.147
She is the cleverest, most shocking,

43:27.314 --> 43:29.191
most alive woman I've ever met.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.526
I'm outclassed in a breath
and she loves me anyway.

43:31.693 --> 43:33.695
I mean, it's the only
bad Mark against her.

43:33.862 --> 43:36.198
Mon ami, bouc, amoureux,

43:36.364 --> 43:38.033
shouting from the rooftops, huh?

43:38.116 --> 43:41.244
Well, no,
not where mother can hear.

43:41.620 --> 43:45.040
Madame bouc does not support
the match, huh?

43:45.207 --> 43:47.959
She's never cared
for anyone I've ever brought home,

43:48.126 --> 43:51.004
unless it was clear
that they were only staying the night.

43:51.171 --> 43:53.215
Being American doesn't help either.

43:53.298 --> 43:56.468
Mother doesn't approve of people
being born outside Mayfair.

43:56.635 --> 43:58.512
She's furious at linnet
for making us a pair.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.263
And her opinion, does it matter?

44:00.430 --> 44:01.556
Money matters,

44:01.723 --> 44:04.226
and mine comes monthly from euphemia bouc.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.644
I've tried to earn enough

44:05.811 --> 44:07.571
so that I don't need
her permission to marry,

44:07.604 --> 44:09.189
only her blessing,

44:09.356 --> 44:10.482
but I'm just rotten at it.

44:12.108 --> 44:13.401
All my life,

44:13.568 --> 44:16.822
I never wanted to be anything to anyone
but an amusement.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.490
But for Rosalie, I...

44:19.241 --> 44:20.826
I want to be good.

44:31.545 --> 44:33.731
Captain mahmoud: Come along.
Ship's crew ready for departure.

44:33.755 --> 44:34.840
Returning 5:00 am.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.676
And remember, we have new guests
arriving at abu simbel.

44:37.843 --> 44:38.927
- Good night.
- Good night.

45:08.874 --> 45:10.417
Louise: We are nearly there.

45:14.296 --> 45:16.047
Captain mahmoud:
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:16.131 --> 45:17.841
we are approaching abu simbel.

45:45.702 --> 45:47.495
We're all going.

45:47.662 --> 45:50.123
No stragglers.
You, too, Louise, you're with us.

45:50.290 --> 45:51.333
I have the pressing to do.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.043
We're in ancient Egypt.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.753
It was your idea for a honeymoon

45:54.920 --> 45:56.504
when you were engaged.

45:56.922 --> 45:59.122
Waitress: Coffee, Mrs. Doyle?
Linnet: Thank you, Claire.

46:00.842 --> 46:01.843
What's that?

46:02.010 --> 46:04.090
Captain mahmoud:
The sandstorm is miles away, madame.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.680
No need to worry.

46:06.598 --> 46:09.100
I can't find my tube of carmine red.

46:09.267 --> 46:12.312
I can't be expected to capture
these horizons without red.

46:12.479 --> 46:15.106
Brushes down, mother.
It's the temple ofabu simbel.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.609
Ramesses the great awaits.

46:24.199 --> 46:25.617
Windlesham: Ramesses ll,

46:25.784 --> 46:29.496
married to nefertari,
first and favorite of his eight wives.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.165
On the walls
of the queen's burial mastaba,

46:32.332 --> 46:33.768
he wrote a poem to her,
which is spectacular...

46:33.792 --> 46:35.672
Louise: Oh, sir, may I see?
Windlesham: Oh, yes.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.171
Louise: "My love is like no other.

46:38.338 --> 46:41.049
"Just by passing, she has stolen my heart.

46:41.216 --> 46:43.927
"She is the one for whom the sun shines."

46:44.678 --> 46:46.012
He is a man in love.

46:46.096 --> 46:49.557
He murdered half of nubia.
Great useless blocks of masonry

46:49.724 --> 46:53.895
put up to minister to the egoism
of a despotic bloated king.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.564
Mm, I really like their hats.

46:56.731 --> 46:57.983
Louise: Fascinating story.

47:05.073 --> 47:07.492
Euphemia: It's bad enough
to be married for one lifetime.

47:07.659 --> 47:11.204
To be side by side for eternity
is inhumane.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.581
Bouc: Why must you be
so cynical, mother?

47:13.748 --> 47:16.835
Euphemia: People build towers
to love in song and stone

47:17.252 --> 47:20.922
as if cooing over a pair of dark eyes
will save them from pain.

47:21.089 --> 47:23.008
If anything, it will double it.

47:23.091 --> 47:24.759
Rosalie: It's over there? Thank you.

47:26.594 --> 47:27.595
Go on.

47:27.887 --> 47:31.182
Think you and that beautiful girl
will be the exception?

47:31.725 --> 47:33.893
Not every love turns to misery.

47:34.060 --> 47:37.147
No, the lucky ones die in childbirth.

47:37.897 --> 47:39.858
It's my job to protect you.

47:40.025 --> 47:42.318
You think I don't know what you're after?

47:42.485 --> 47:46.531
You... you want my blessing
to marry that girl.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.158
Well, you can't have it.

47:57.751 --> 47:58.918
Rosalie!

48:00.545 --> 48:02.005
Everything all right?

48:02.088 --> 48:03.089
Yes.

48:03.423 --> 48:05.467
No more hiding.

48:05.842 --> 48:08.970
- We'll make it on our own.
- Yes.

48:09.429 --> 48:10.555
Whoo!

48:12.015 --> 48:14.476
Captain mahmoud:
New passenger coming aboard.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.148
Rosalie: I've got too much
sand in my shoes.

48:44.172 --> 48:45.465
Bouc: Here we are! How's that?

48:48.384 --> 48:49.928
You approve of them?

48:51.346 --> 48:53.348
First man she ever brought home,

48:53.515 --> 48:54.766
a wealthy lawyer.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.226
Straight, narrow,

48:56.392 --> 48:58.812
on his way to being a Missouri senator.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.231
Then, there was a baron
who owned islands,

49:01.314 --> 49:02.649
manners of a king.

49:02.816 --> 49:05.443
Now, it's this penniless bouc

49:05.610 --> 49:08.113
who drinks too much,
andlaughstooloud

49:08.279 --> 49:10.031
and always at the wrong thing.

49:11.407 --> 49:14.577
I like him best.

49:16.913 --> 49:18.331
Do you have a husband, madame?

49:18.498 --> 49:20.542
I've had a handful of husbands.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.460
Each one, a handful.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.047
Are you married, Mr. Poirot?

49:26.214 --> 49:27.382
I have not that Felicity.

49:27.549 --> 49:28.967
Which Felicity do you have?

49:33.888 --> 49:35.431
I have my cases.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.767
- I have my books.
- Oh.

49:39.853 --> 49:41.604
I, uh...

49:41.688 --> 49:45.859
In fact, I have my eye
on a cottage where I hope, uh,

49:46.609 --> 49:49.237
eventually to retire...

49:49.946 --> 49:51.072
And garden.

49:53.700 --> 49:57.036
I hope to perfect a new

49:57.203 --> 49:59.706
strain of the vegetable marrows.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.335
They are magnificent vegetables,

50:04.502 --> 50:05.980
but they lack a little bit of flavor
which is...

50:06.004 --> 50:09.465
I would prefer more flavorsome vegetables.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.305
Madame.

50:16.639 --> 50:19.851
What are you really doing way out here,
Mr. Poirot?

50:22.353 --> 50:23.771
Madame.

50:27.066 --> 50:30.653
You do realize
we've barely held hands past Cairo.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.615
I haven't been myself.

50:34.324 --> 50:36.075
Well, who shall you be, then?

50:38.328 --> 50:40.413
Cleopatra, of course.

50:43.917 --> 50:45.168
Come with me.

50:45.335 --> 50:46.377
Come on.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.463
The ruler of two kingdoms.

50:59.349 --> 51:02.060
Linnet: What would Cleopatra say?

51:02.143 --> 51:04.270
"Oh, charmian.

51:04.646 --> 51:07.482
"Where think'st thou he is now?

51:08.316 --> 51:10.526
"Stands he

51:11.027 --> 51:12.403
"or sits he?

51:13.821 --> 51:15.490
"Or does he walk?

51:16.950 --> 51:18.618
"Or is he on his horse?

51:21.120 --> 51:23.206
"Oh, happy horse,

51:23.373 --> 51:25.708
"to bear the weight of Antony!"

51:27.460 --> 51:29.337
"He is speaking now.

51:30.255 --> 51:31.589
"Or murmuring..."

51:31.756 --> 51:33.091
Oh, my god.

51:37.720 --> 51:42.225
"Where is my serpent of old nile?"

51:48.064 --> 51:49.315
Poirot: Look out! Bouc!

52:03.162 --> 52:04.831
Bouc: Everybody inside quickly!

52:12.964 --> 52:14.340
Poirot: Bouc, inside!

52:15.216 --> 52:16.509
Windlesham: Get inside!

52:20.054 --> 52:22.682
There was a balcony above the cliff,
a worker's platform,

52:22.849 --> 52:24.058
but no sign of anyone.

52:24.767 --> 52:26.407
Do you think someone did that on purpose?

52:30.189 --> 52:31.524
Let's get you safe, dove.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.584
Small world.

53:33.336 --> 53:34.712
Simon: The captain just swore

53:34.796 --> 53:36.482
that Jackie got here
when we left for the temple.

53:36.506 --> 53:37.546
It couldn't have been her.

53:37.673 --> 53:39.967
I know she tried to kill us.
I want her off the ship now.

53:40.134 --> 53:43.096
She already had a ticket to board here.
Boughtahead.

53:43.262 --> 53:44.430
There's nothing we can do.

53:44.597 --> 53:46.516
I don't care! She always does this!

53:46.682 --> 53:49.102
Just tell me what it costs
to get her away from me!

53:49.268 --> 53:50.311
Name a price!

53:50.395 --> 53:52.563
I'll buy the whole damn boat if I have to.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.774
I'll buy the whole damn country!

54:26.973 --> 54:29.183
- Louise: Madame.
- Thank you.

54:29.350 --> 54:30.852
Thank you.

54:31.018 --> 54:32.061
Louise.

54:32.562 --> 54:35.314
Have you seen my scarf?
I swear I had it earlier.

54:35.481 --> 54:37.817
No. No, miss Marie.
I'll be sure to look.

54:37.984 --> 54:39.110
Okay. You...

54:39.277 --> 54:41.279
You don't take your meals with us?

54:41.446 --> 54:42.864
Miss linnet prefers me not to.

54:43.281 --> 54:44.782
Oh.

54:45.658 --> 54:47.285
Ah, I love that girl linnet.

54:47.452 --> 54:49.829
But when the revolution comes,
she'll be the first.

54:50.246 --> 54:52.623
Blindfold, last cigarette,
up against the wall.

54:52.707 --> 54:53.708
Bang!

54:58.296 --> 55:00.715
Some detective. My ledger?

55:00.882 --> 55:02.341
You've taken my book.

55:04.677 --> 55:07.555
J'ai fait une erreur béte, pardonnez-moi.

55:07.722 --> 55:10.349
I confuse you with, uh,

55:10.516 --> 55:12.852
my Edwin drood in the parlor.

55:12.935 --> 55:14.979
- Rosalie: Oh.
- I can see by your penmanship,

55:15.146 --> 55:17.106
you are dickens' rival in precision.

55:17.190 --> 55:18.399
Mm-hmm.

55:22.403 --> 55:23.738
Monsieur poirot.

55:24.947 --> 55:25.948
I wanted you to know

55:26.032 --> 55:28.159
you won't have to look out
for us any longer.

55:29.869 --> 55:32.538
Simon: Jackie might not be able
to see reason,

55:32.622 --> 55:33.623
but we can.

55:34.081 --> 55:35.249
We're going home.

55:35.625 --> 55:37.769
We'll get a car to Khartoum
first thing in the morning.

55:37.793 --> 55:40.254
And then donkey to rail to ship
to wode hall,

55:40.421 --> 55:42.089
and then familiar beds forever.

55:42.256 --> 55:43.633
To hell with Jackie de bellefort.

55:52.350 --> 55:53.390
Bouc: Oh, dear.

55:53.434 --> 55:55.520
One last cork, though. Why not?

55:55.686 --> 55:57.271
I do not normally take I'alcool...

55:59.649 --> 56:00.858
But for this...

56:01.025 --> 56:02.026
Dove.

56:02.985 --> 56:03.986
Monsieur.

56:04.111 --> 56:05.196
- Poirot: Yes.
- Yes.

56:06.155 --> 56:07.990
- To going home.
- To going home.

56:08.157 --> 56:09.200
Thank you.

56:27.385 --> 56:28.511
You're not built for boats.

56:28.678 --> 56:30.429
Or champagne.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.732
Did you know that the wives
of dead pharaohs

56:41.816 --> 56:43.526
were buried alive with them?

56:44.318 --> 56:46.153
They must have been locked in screaming.

56:47.863 --> 56:50.283
But I bet there was one who was willing

56:50.449 --> 56:52.118
and couldn't bear to be parted.

56:53.661 --> 56:55.204
You're sorry to see me.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.584
Like it or not, I'm in his thoughts.

57:01.085 --> 57:02.378
Simon is afraid of me.

57:02.545 --> 57:05.089
Mademoiselle, you have a choice still.

57:05.256 --> 57:08.301
You can ruin his life or begin a new one.

57:08.467 --> 57:10.720
It may not be the life that you imagined,

57:10.886 --> 57:13.889
but perhaps it will be the life
that god intended.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.435
Love is far too important to trust to god.

57:18.436 --> 57:21.230
From the moment I met Simon,
I knew one thing for absolute certain,

57:21.397 --> 57:23.774
I will die if we are parted.

57:24.025 --> 57:26.110
I once felt as you do.

57:27.486 --> 57:29.155
I loved so much.

57:29.989 --> 57:32.658
I thought that if I lost her,
I should die.

57:33.618 --> 57:34.785
I lost her.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.579
To another man?

57:37.622 --> 57:39.373
A mortar shell.

57:40.625 --> 57:42.168
Visiting me in hospital.

57:42.335 --> 57:45.004
I was to be discharged in a month,

57:45.171 --> 57:49.842
but I begged for her to come at Christmas,
to be together.

57:50.009 --> 57:52.803
She came, but the train was...

58:02.938 --> 58:04.357
After Katherine,

58:05.524 --> 58:07.109
I became

58:08.527 --> 58:10.821
whatever it is I am now.

58:17.203 --> 58:19.372
I was going to be a farmer.

58:27.922 --> 58:29.715
Forgive me, the champagne...

58:30.966 --> 58:35.054
It loosens the, uh, memory
and the mouth.

58:36.889 --> 58:39.475
Captain mahmoud:
Ship's crew ready for departure.

58:49.318 --> 58:50.986
Simon: It's after 12:00.

58:51.153 --> 58:52.571
The crew's left the boat.

58:52.655 --> 58:54.657
Well, I want another cocktail.

58:55.825 --> 58:58.160
Linnet: I'm done with today.
Simon: No, no.

58:58.244 --> 58:59.680
Linnet: Time for bed, my love.

58:59.704 --> 59:00.830
Yes.

59:00.996 --> 59:03.749
I'll take a pill,
so don't worry about waking me.

59:08.379 --> 59:09.672
You're notjoining her, Simon?

59:09.839 --> 59:11.924
Oh, we've already made love today.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.719
- Twice.
- Three times.

59:16.387 --> 59:18.806
Sleep well, la reine linnet.

59:24.687 --> 59:27.189
Linnet: Jackie, I wish you well.

59:27.356 --> 59:28.566
I do.

59:28.733 --> 59:30.109
I'm not sorry for what we did,

59:30.276 --> 59:33.529
but I'm so sorry
for what it did to you.

59:36.073 --> 59:37.783
I wish we could stay friends.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.912
You were the only one
who never cared about the money.

59:46.751 --> 59:48.335
Good night, Jacks.

01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:16.113
This is the last time
that you'll see either of us.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:19.158
You can't disappear.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.993
- Let's call it a night, Jackie.
- Yeah.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.330
Oh, no, stay for a bit.
She's working up for a scene.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.374
God, I feel so free

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:31.337
and so fat-headed
for not turning around sooner.

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.714
You can't get rid of me that easily,
Simon.

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.175
We were bound.

01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.803
Heart and body, I gave you all of me.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.430
A few months of good times? Hmm?

01:00:41.764 --> 01:00:42.848
Were they even that good?

01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:46.936
I swear, looking at you now
makes all the fond memories go sour.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.522
It's like trying to remember a party
after you've been sick.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:50.940
Simon, don't be cruel.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:53.818
I've run dry on sympathy.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:56.944
Did you really think this little stunt
of yours would bring me back to you?

01:00:57.112 --> 01:01:00.991
You're a fool if you thought
I could ever love you again.

01:01:01.534 --> 01:01:02.993
I don't think I ever did.

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.662
Simon, that's enough.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:08.415
You don't mean that.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.877
You don't.

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.093
Say you don't mean it!

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.304
Simon?

01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.639
Simon.

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:30.688
- Sorry.
- Rosalie: No, no, no.

01:01:32.982 --> 01:01:34.817
Rosalie, take her to bowers.

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:36.151
- Now.
- Simon.

01:01:37.278 --> 01:01:39.613
- Simon.
- No, no, no.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.906
I'll get the doctor.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:42.116
- Rosalie!
- Huh?

01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:48.247
Bouc: Bowers! Nurse bowers!

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:50.207
Jackie: Simon.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:51.750
Bowers?

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:55.337
- No, no. Hey, hey! It's all right.
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:56.672
I'm so sorry!

01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:58.007
Bouc: Dr. Windlesham!

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:02.678
What's going on?

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:05.389
It's Simon, in the parlor. It looks bad.

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:08.392
Rosalie, stay there.
I will find nurse bowers.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.727
- Yes.
- Right.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:13.814
Bowers?

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:16.317
- Bowers!
- Bouc?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.777
Marie: What's going on out there?
Bowers: What's the matter?

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.404
It's Jackie. Bring your bag.

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.072
Marie: What's happened? Huh?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.824
- Bouc: This way.
- I don't know.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.827
Jackie.

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.621
Come straight in here.

01:02:34.209 --> 01:02:35.419
- All right?
- Yes, go!

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.005
Simon: She shot me!

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.090
No, no, I can't.
I can't move my leg.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.550
Windlesham: Bouc, help me.

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:43.037
- Help me move him.
- Bouc: Right.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.262
With me.

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:46.430
- Get him up!
- All right.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.515
Bouc: All right.

01:02:48.599 --> 01:02:49.784
I'll give you something to ease the pain.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.745
Are you sure you don't want
to make it hurt more, doctor?

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.103
Settle the score.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:55.940
The bone's shattered.
We need a hospital.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.904
That was so stupid of me
to rile up Jacks like that.

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:05.199
You're a bright boy now.
You just might deserve that bullet.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:07.910
Simon: Don't leave her alone.

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:10.079
She didn't... she didn't...

01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:11.246
She could hurt herself.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.623
She won't.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.959
I've given her something to calm her down.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.335
I'll stay with her.

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:17.962
Good. Come on.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.588
Let's get him to bed.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:20.881
Careful.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.758
All right, almost there.

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:24.051
Here we go.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.805
Steady. Steady, steady, steady.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.306
- That's good.
- There we are.

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:31.113
This should help you sleep.

01:03:35.062 --> 01:03:37.022
Simon: Oh, god.

01:05:21.168 --> 01:05:22.169
Oh, god...

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.089
Poirot: Time of death?

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:28.926
Windlesham: Six hours ago.
Eight at most.

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:31.678
Sometime between midnight and 2:00 am.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:36.350
No evidence of struggle.
She died in her sleep.

01:05:37.184 --> 01:05:38.477
At least that.

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:43.398
Gun held to the temple.
There's scorch marks there.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.736
God...

01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:51.698
One bullet.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.575
Small caliber.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:56.078
Probably a .22.

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:01.250
- Jackie: Practically a toy.
- Practically a toy.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.919
Ah, good.
I was hoping you were the day shift.

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:05.295
Is someone ill?

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.964
Someone is dead.

01:06:07.131 --> 01:06:09.133
- Linnet Doyle.
- Bowers: Linnet?

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.634
Stop. What do you mean? How?

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:14.346
I'm afraid Jacqueline de bellefort
has made good on her threat.

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.393
No, that's impossible.
I was with her all night.

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:18.350
She slept right here.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:19.768
Out cold.

01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:22.479
Poirot: Could she have left
even for a moment?

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.606
Did you leave her side or sleep at all?

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.942
No, not a minute. No. Not awink.

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.695
And even if! Had,
I was scared she might hurt herself,

01:06:29.862 --> 01:06:32.906
so I gave her enough morphia
to fell an elephant.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.175
Poirot: Was there a single moment

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.552
when mademoiselle de bellefort
left your sight?

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:36.577
Never, no.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:37.971
Bouc: So Jackie couldn't
have murdered linnet.

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:40.181
Poirot: Just as she could not have
pushed a Boulder onto Simon Doyle.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:41.808
What did you do
after bringing her to miss bowers?

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.185
Rosalie: We came back here
to pick up the gun and lock it away.

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.329
I kicked it under the couch,

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:46.813
but when we came back,
we couldn't find it.

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:48.648
Bouc: I wanted to wake you.
Rosalie: I said not to.

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:49.858
Poirot: You did not want my assistance.

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:51.717
Bouc: No, stop that.
She was linnet's friend.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.428
Rosalie: It's all right.
He's a bloodhound, let him sniff.

01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:57.306
Simon was with the doctor
and Jackie was with the nurse.

01:06:57.806 --> 01:06:59.450
I just figured it was
an awful lovers' quarrel

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.934
and not a case for the detective.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:04.646
Ah, but the mysterious case
of the vanishing pistol.

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:06.064
Someone locates it

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:10.235
in the moments between you bringing
Mr. Doyle to the doctor and your return,

01:07:10.736 --> 01:07:14.615
and then presumably uses it
to commit the murder of linnet Doyle

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.201
and part two lovers forever.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:24.124
Bouc, tell the captain
to dredge the river around the ship.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.919
Simon Doyle must be told.

01:07:33.884 --> 01:07:34.885
Linnet.

01:07:44.603 --> 01:07:48.106
Oh, god. It was Jackie!

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:51.485
God damn her! I could kill her!

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:55.113
Jacqueline de bellefort
was not the killer.

01:07:55.948 --> 01:07:57.282
She shot me!

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.910
She has a concrete alibi
for the entire night

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.246
from the moment she fired her gun at you.

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:06.375
Oh, god.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.013
Linnet.

01:08:20.389 --> 01:08:21.723
You have to help me.

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.519
Please. You have to find out
who killed my wife.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.270
Did you suspect any of them?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.149
Everyone loved linnet.

01:09:12.316 --> 01:09:15.402
Yet, your wife confessed lately
that she did not feel safe with them.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:21.575
There... there were petty things.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.830
I, uh, wasn't crazy about her old Beau
being on the ship,

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:28.497
mooning over her the entire time.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.417
She mentioned something about salome.

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:34.587
Some incident that had happened years ago.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.041
She didn't say what exactly.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.591
What of your maid, Louise bourget?

01:09:38.759 --> 01:09:40.260
There had been a disagreement, no?

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:43.220
It was just that Louise had left
some things at the hotel.

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.265
Silly things. Nail varnish.

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:48.185
No. She had been with linnet for years.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.325
She even had charge of linnet's necklace.

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.439
- Check on the necklace.
- Simon: It's by the bed.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:53.814
Poirot: Thank you, bouc.

01:09:58.612 --> 01:09:59.821
Bouc: It's not here.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.185
So, did you see the necklace
when you came in this morning?

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:07.329
Alors, I saw miss linnet there.

01:10:07.496 --> 01:10:08.538
Dead.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.249
I dropped the tray and ran out.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.376
What did she mean earlier
on the way to abu simbel

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.004
when she said the travel to Egypt
was your idea?

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:17.631
For your own honeymoon.

01:10:20.092 --> 01:10:23.345
Perhaps miss bourget would prefer privacy
for this intimate detail.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:24.739
So, if you could please take Mr. Doyle...

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:26.807
But, no, if you please,
I prefer Mr. Doyle hear me,

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.725
so he does not accuse me of a secret.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:30.519
- Accuse you of a secret?
- Louise: Oui.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:32.437
She ended my engagement.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.482
Miss linnet gave a party last year.

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:37.150
A man spoke to me,

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:40.320
and found me after.

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.656
When he proposed, I gave notice.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:47.285
Miss linnet was suspect
of his intentions with me.

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:48.370
Just a maid.

01:10:48.537 --> 01:10:50.122
She had him investigated.

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.165
He had debts.

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:55.335
She offered to pay them all off
if he would drop me,

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:59.464
to make a test of his affection.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:04.803
He dropped me.

01:11:07.139 --> 01:11:09.224
For my benefit, she said.

01:11:12.436 --> 01:11:16.481
That same money, handed to me as a dowry,
could have given me a life.

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.228
What did you do last night
after you left miss linnet?

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:23.363
I went to my cabin on the deck below.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.948
Did you go anywhere else?

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:26.992
See or hear anything else?

01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:28.660
Forgive me, sir.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.580
If I had come outside my cabin to smoke,

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:34.124
I might have seen her killer
enter or leave her cabin.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.209
But you did not or you did?
What is this?

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:40.422
Uh, no, I... I did.
I did have a cigarette inside.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:43.967
You all are staring at me.
It's making me...

01:11:44.134 --> 01:11:46.845
Please. You know we kept confidences.

01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:49.347
I was childish at times, but that's all.

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.892
Tell them. I would never hurt miss linnet.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.144
Simon: Yes, of course. Easy, easy goes it.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:56.313
Uh, no one here
is accusing you of anything.

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:58.857
I know you've always
taken good care of linnet,

01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:01.776
and I will be certain to take care of you.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.531
That can be enough, can't it?
Surely, we can let the poor girl go.

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:09.284
You don't think someone would kill linnet
to steal her necklace?

01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:11.077
I've seen people poisoned for less.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.564
Captain mahmoud:
Dredge the river.

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.588
Bowers: Please be careful with those.

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:29.930
Oh, come on.

01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:34.184
These are what few
private possessions I have.

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:35.977
I trust you'll be sensitive.

01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:47.601
Bouc: All the money in the world

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:50.575
and she's in the freezer with the hams.

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:54.913
This is as much dignity
as we can afford the dead

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.082
in these circumstances.

01:13:04.631 --> 01:13:06.258
Uh, doctor, before you go.

01:13:07.676 --> 01:13:12.138
You joined this wedding party
despite your obvious affection.

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:14.849
You had no reservation
to see her with another?

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:17.435
Some people you can't say no to.
She asked.

01:13:17.602 --> 01:13:20.355
If I may ask a question, please,
about your passport.

01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:24.651
You go by Dr. Windlesham,
but this is not your natural title.

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.946
- No.
- Lord windlesham.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.782
Born to, not earned.

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:34.995
What I do as lord windlesham
belongs to buck-toothed tradition.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.247
What I do as doctor is mine.

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:39.749
And Dr. Windlesham travels widely, hmm?

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.001
India, Africa.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:45.797
Much of the world lacks access to modern
medicine we take for granted, poirot.

01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:49.134
Most nobility enjoy their nobility more.

01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:51.511
Linnet used to tease me for that.

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:55.765
Said I shouldn't expect her to honeymoon
in a mud hut.

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:02.522
Your thoughts to her were always tender.
What of the husband?

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.649
I don't know him well.

01:14:05.317 --> 01:14:06.735
What I do know, I can't recommend.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.111
This is appropriate.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.530
Mr. Doyle would have us
focus our suspicions on you.

01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:11.656
Windlesham: Me?

01:14:12.157 --> 01:14:13.700
I was with him all last night.

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.803
Poirot: Indeed. You gave him
a strong opiate injection.

01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:16.828
He was asleep.

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.456
You could have left him at any time
and not been observed.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.750
- Did he ask for the drug?
- He was in pain.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:24.961
There are less powerful pain medications
in your bag which would suffice.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.047
You created for yourself an opportunity.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.716
- I didn't create an opportunity.
- Poirot: She was unkind, no?

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.552
She flaunted her new love,
yet still called you like the puppy dog.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:33.887
Seeing them pained you,

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:37.057
and like the strong opiate injection,
you could end your pain with a bullet.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.725
Lords demand to get what they want,

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:39.851
and you are still a lord.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.478
What do you want me to say?

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:43.229
What do you want me to say?

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:44.939
That I know I'm ridiculous?

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:54.032
I'm not a fool.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.994
I knew she was settling for me.

01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:00.246
I didn't mind.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:04.918
When she married Simon,

01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:08.505
I actually thought
about ending my own life.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.801
They all thought our engagement
was for the families,

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:16.179
the papers, for the damn aristocratic
theatrics of it all.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.892
The shame of it is...

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.437
I loved her.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.695
Poirot:
Little linny and cousin Andrew.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:35.198
Andrew: I knew her
since we were children.

01:15:35.615 --> 01:15:37.951
Were you aware of any grudges
against the family?

01:15:38.118 --> 01:15:39.703
More than many.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:42.163
Her father got rich
making rich people poor.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.040
Linny continued the practice.

01:15:44.207 --> 01:15:46.102
Did you hear anything
of the commotion last night?

01:15:46.126 --> 01:15:47.293
I was all snores by 11:00.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.060
And the contracts you wished her to sign,
they are very important?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.716
Yes. They are. Were.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:56.094
With linny gone, the, uh,
estate will have to be redrawn.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.178
May I see them?

01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.389
Forgive me. These are confidential.

01:16:00.432 --> 01:16:01.975
I must insist.

01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:04.078
- Respect for the deceased.
- No matter, I know what they contain.

01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:05.103
I doubt that very much.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:08.648
I believe they extend your stewardship
of madam Doyle's estate,

01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:10.316
despite her marriage, no?

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.526
Who told you?

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:13.486
I am hercule poirot.

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.631
I do not need to be told.
I have eyes and they see.

01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:18.366
A brain and it thinks.
It now thinks somewhat poorly of you.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:23.163
- You think I killed her?
- Did you kill her?

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.291
I don't benefit a dime
from her death, Mr. Poirot.

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:28.042
You can look at the will I revised.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.336
A godmother stands to inherit.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:32.797
Her husband legally gets the rest.

01:16:32.964 --> 01:16:34.591
You won't see my name anywhere.

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:39.095
Perhaps the intention was not to inherit,
but to conceal.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:42.724
You executed control
over her vast fortune.

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:45.894
Not a concern, so long as
there is no impropriety,

01:16:46.603 --> 01:16:49.898
no speculation by loyal cousin Andrew,

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:51.858
in a time of market decline.

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:54.065
This is not a kind of thing
you can prove on a boat.

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:57.489
You endeavored to obtain a signature

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:02.202
by trickery, from little linny,
and you failed.

01:17:03.328 --> 01:17:05.121
You knew it was only a matter of time

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:08.583
before her keen eyes
uncovered your thievery,

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:12.629
unless her eyes were closed forever.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:19.177
You see, in my position, Mr. Poirot,

01:17:19.344 --> 01:17:23.640
I often have to transport items
such as canvases worth millions.

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:26.017
And they need security.

01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.645
So, if I wanted to kill her,

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.605
I would have used this.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.903
A .45.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.279
Yes.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.489
You may go.

01:17:46.621 --> 01:17:47.872
Bouc: A .45.

01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:50.142
Why would he risk going back
for Jackie's gun if he had that?

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.292
Poirot: He would not.

01:17:52.794 --> 01:17:55.171
Miss bowers, if I might trouble you.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:58.508
He wants to speak with me?
I'm laying down a corner.

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.820
There's nothing to fear.
Only you might know something of value.

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:02.554
That would be the shocking twist.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.240
If you wouldn't mind her coming alone.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.224
I damn well would.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.243
Bowers: I want these
served at my funeral.

01:18:12.272 --> 01:18:13.415
Poirot: Mm-hmm.

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.859
When you kept vigil with
mademoiselle de bellefort,

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:19.362
did she make threats against linnet Doyle?

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:21.406
No, her threats were against herself.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.617
She wanted to pitch herself
into the drink and not come up.

01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:26.661
That's why I gave her all the morphia.

01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:29.122
How fortunate that we had you with us.

01:18:29.289 --> 01:18:31.291
You have been a nurse companion
for how long?

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:35.128
Um... well, coming on 10 years.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:39.674
All with Mrs. Van schuyler,
so it feels like 20.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.137
The job came to me late in life.

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:46.973
Ah, after you lost your great wealth.

01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:49.684
Wealth?

01:18:49.767 --> 01:18:51.728
Acquired tastes require acquisition,

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:55.607
and here, you moon over truffle
and king crabs.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.400
So, too, your gown, Chanel,

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.069
your luggage, Vuitton,
your shoes, perugia.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:04.365
All the peak of chic 10 years past,
worn and patched over.

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:07.785
How many years since
you had caviar, did you say?

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:13.583
Many lost fortunes in the crash.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.754
Many of them due to papa ridgeway
and his unscrupulous business practices.

01:19:17.921 --> 01:19:19.839
Perhaps that explains your reaction

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:23.468
to the lease of linnet's
London property. Hmm?

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.516
It was once called the bowers building.

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:36.564
We employed over a thousand people,
good wages.

01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:40.151
We spread our wealth, when we had it.

01:19:41.903 --> 01:19:45.531
So many like family.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.160
Some never found work again.

01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:52.705
So, yes, I miss caviar.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:55.625
But I miss them more.

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:58.419
And you, feeling as you do,
with your charge

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:00.922
mademoiselle de bellefort
drugged into slumber,

01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:02.775
you are free to move about the ship,
to find the gun,

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.300
- to shoot linnet Doyle...
- No!

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:05.569
Bouc: He specifically asked
to see you separately.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:06.779
- While she sleeps.
- Bouc: Mrs. Van schuyler.

01:20:06.803 --> 01:20:08.483
- Marie: Stop interfering!
- Ah! A visitor.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:11.808
She cannot be without her miss bowers
for even a moment.

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:13.415
Please. Please, join us to tea, huh?

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:16.187
He's just accused me of shooting linnet.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.271
No, no, no.

01:20:17.355 --> 01:20:21.150
I merely, uh, suggest a possibility.

01:20:21.693 --> 01:20:24.028
Marie: I don't approve
of this interrogation.

01:20:24.195 --> 01:20:26.280
I mean, who are you to question us?

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.241
I am the working man.

01:20:28.408 --> 01:20:32.912
The skilled laborer,
the hero of your own economic fairy tales.

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:36.374
Well, I don't care for it. Or for you.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:39.877
You are meant to be finding the killer

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.796
of my goddaughter.

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:47.218
I never had children of my own.

01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:50.847
I had linnet.

01:20:51.723 --> 01:20:53.558
You are aware, of course,

01:20:53.725 --> 01:20:57.437
that you are a key beneficiary
in linnet Doyle's will.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:00.940
You accuse me now of murder?

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:02.627
Oh, no, he accuses everyone of murder.

01:21:02.734 --> 01:21:04.027
It is a problem, I admit.

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:10.241
That I would kill
my own goddaughter for money?

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:14.287
I already gave away a fortune.

01:21:14.454 --> 01:21:16.372
I don't give a fig for money.

01:21:17.123 --> 01:21:19.834
I see no reason to continue
this conversation. Come on, bowers.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:23.337
The stewards on this ship keep
an excellent room. Have you noticed?

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:27.008
A truly first-rate housekeeping staff.

01:21:27.175 --> 01:21:28.384
He's off his rails.

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:29.719
Beds made every day,

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:33.848
sheets folded in marvelously precise
45-degree hospital corners, I must say.

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:37.101
Unlike, for example, the day we departed,

01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:42.940
when the beds were made
in the flowing edged bedspread style.

01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:45.943
But, you know, when I saw
mademoiselle de bellefort

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:49.655
asleep in miss bowers' room
on our third day aboard,

01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:54.452
the bed was as it had been on our first.

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:57.205
As yet unslept in.

01:21:58.456 --> 01:21:59.749
Bouc,

01:21:59.916 --> 01:22:03.711
where did you find miss bowers
when you sought her aid?

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:05.922
In Mrs. Van schuyler's room.

01:22:08.091 --> 01:22:09.300
My mind asks...

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:15.223
Here is a woman for whom the fire against
class and materialism burns so hot

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:17.683
and yet she keeps a servant?

01:22:21.354 --> 01:22:23.147
Her servant is no servant...

01:22:24.315 --> 01:22:27.652
Nor nurse, only companion.

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:30.488
Let us name the reason.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:31.823
Love.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:36.285
Don't worry.

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:39.831
Poirot: And I know this.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.457
It's all right.

01:22:42.125 --> 01:22:46.879
People kill for love.

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:48.606
Man: They found something!

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:51.134
Bowers: What?

01:22:51.217 --> 01:22:53.136
Man: They found something!

01:22:53.553 --> 01:22:54.804
Monsieur poirot.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.492
Captain mahmoud: Well done, young man.
Go and get yourself cleaned up.

01:22:58.516 --> 01:22:59.517
Man 2: Yes, sir.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:00.726
Bowers: It's your scarf.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:04.188
But it went missing.
I've been looking for it since the temple.

01:23:04.355 --> 01:23:06.649
Bowers: It's true.
We couldn't find it anywhere.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:14.365
Poirot: It has had
an adventure in your absence.

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:17.493
Your scarf, complete with bullet holes...

01:23:20.246 --> 01:23:22.290
Used to dampen the noise of a shot.

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:23.896
Poirot: Also a bloodied handkerchief

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:27.587
and the .22 derringer
belonging to Jacqueline de bellefort.

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:30.965
Two bullets fired.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:33.718
Captain mahmoud:
We return immediately to assouan.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.265
Ooh, I like this.

01:23:39.432 --> 01:23:42.018
The full force of his forceful attention.

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:44.520
The great mind, all mine.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.231
Flirtation, however delightful,
will have no effect.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.067
A woman shows you a direct bit of interest

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:52.445
and you assume
it can only be to hide guilt.

01:23:54.197 --> 01:23:56.991
Whoever she was
must've done a number on you.

01:23:57.158 --> 01:24:00.745
That mask covers your whole face,
doesn't it?

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:07.251
You knew linnet Doyle before you came
to entertain us, yes?

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:09.420
- Paths crossed.
- You did not like her?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.504
I stay polite.

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:14.133
Monsieur Doyle mentioned an incident
with the victim long ago.

01:24:14.425 --> 01:24:17.220
A reason for possible animosity.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.682
Poolside, kennebunkport.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:24.518
Summer of '24, before I was someone.

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:26.354
I played a show at the hotel

01:24:26.437 --> 01:24:29.565
and thought to take Rosie
for a swim before packing.

01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:32.360
A young girl complained to her papa

01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:34.820
about having to share the pool
with a colored.

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:38.115
We were told to leave,
and when I did not abide,

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:39.700
I was made to.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.372
I wasn't sure she'd even remember it.
I do.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:45.706
It was '25.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.626
So does she.

01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:51.170
Mademoiselle.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.050
She shamed you in front of your ward.

01:24:56.217 --> 01:24:57.218
Salome: Monsieur poirot,

01:24:57.385 --> 01:24:59.929
if I put a bullet in everyone
who took a potshot at me

01:25:00.096 --> 01:25:01.889
for not keeping to my place,

01:25:02.056 --> 01:25:05.434
the world would be littered
with dead white ladies.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.728
Rosalie: Linnetwasjust a kid back then.

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:10.856
Taught by a bad daddy.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:13.859
But she became my friend
in boarding school.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.988
Gave the other girls license
to do the same.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:19.573
Truth to tell...

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.577
Linnet was as easy to hate as love.

01:25:24.996 --> 01:25:26.497
I might have done both.

01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.875
That is a very honest reply.

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:32.878
I thank you both for your time, mesdames.

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:36.173
There was one final question.
It is a curiosity of mine.

01:25:36.382 --> 01:25:38.843
Your hat. In the turban style.

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:41.650
As many times as I have seen you,
you have always worn one like it,

01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:43.124
but it is out of the fashion, no?

01:25:43.931 --> 01:25:45.933
Not when I wear it.

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:51.105
If you would indulge me,
please, to remove it.

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:53.858
- Rosalie: Mm-mm.
- Oh! It's all right, Rosie.

01:25:54.025 --> 01:25:56.819
He's driving at an answer
he already knows.

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:06.537
.22 caliber, like the one
that killed linnet Doyle.

01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:08.664
I've used it, if you wanna ask.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:11.375
Twice in defense, once in anger.

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.919
Last night was not that once.

01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:15.796
You tell me if I'm lying.

01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:17.506
Mr. Poirot.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:18.716
Monsieur.

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:20.468
You interrupt at a poor time, madame.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.987
You're meant to be the detective,

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:25.014
yet I found this.

01:26:28.351 --> 01:26:31.687
It was there,
right in my vanity drawer,

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:33.606
face up like a yolk.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.735
You know I didn't take it.

01:26:37.902 --> 01:26:39.737
No. Which is why
our killer has remanded it

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.030
to your custody to return.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.382
Bouc: Thank you.
Poirot: Unless...

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:43.759
Bouc: Poirot.
Euphemia: Unless what?

01:26:43.783 --> 01:26:46.827
Unless you took the necklace
to steer suspicion away from you.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.705
Evidence is easily disposed of
over the ship's railing.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:53.376
Whoever did this made a show of discovery.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.294
Why would my mother murder linnet?

01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:58.315
Poirot: Bouc, you said your mother was
furious with linnet for making you a pair.

01:26:58.339 --> 01:27:00.549
Madame, it was linnet Doyle
who introduced your son

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:03.052
- to a woman you distrust, no?
- Rest assured,

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:06.305
if I had a bullet in my pocket
to correct my son's poor taste,

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:08.140
I would not spend it on Mrs. Doyle.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:09.747
Mother, please, that is not helping.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.269
Perhaps. But I have seen
your excellent landscapes.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:16.315
You are a patient woman who achieves
every effect she intends in time.

01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:20.444
Who so diligently planned
to have me aboard this ship,

01:27:20.611 --> 01:27:25.199
yet with my suspicions
diverted in another direction.

01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:26.534
That is a private affair.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.285
That is a concluded affair, madame.

01:27:28.452 --> 01:27:30.287
- Enough.
- Enoughindeed.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.456
I am now prepared
to present the conclusions

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:35.876
of my other, more secret case
and put it to rest.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.795
Secret case? What?

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:39.880
What does he mean?

01:27:39.964 --> 01:27:41.507
Mother?

01:27:45.636 --> 01:27:47.471
- Monsieur.
- Mademoiselle.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:54.353
Mesdames, thank you for joining us.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.729
Bouc.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.983
I will make my own confession.

01:27:59.567 --> 01:28:03.195
When we met in giza, I told you
I was on vacation from my detective work

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:07.575
when in fact,
I was and have been on a case.

01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:08.951
What case?

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:10.786
You.

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:13.330
At the request of your mother,
madame bouc,

01:28:13.414 --> 01:28:16.041
who cabled me in distress
some weeks ago.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:17.877
My mother, in distress?

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:19.603
I was bidden to follow the otterbournes

01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:23.382
to determine the character and fitness
of the show business woman

01:28:23.549 --> 01:28:24.717
who had stolen your heart.

01:28:25.968 --> 01:28:26.969
You did this to me?

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:28.929
I'm your mother. I've done far worse.

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:30.181
Poirot: To observe them,

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:33.058
I had to consume many doses
of the bluesy music,

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:35.478
which, I confess,
I did not expect to enjoy,

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:36.896
but, in fact, I did very much

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:38.457
as performed by madame otterbourne.

01:28:38.481 --> 01:28:40.983
It was unusual for me,
but it was very nice.

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:42.693
That's why you were in giza.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.820
How we met "accidentally."

01:28:44.987 --> 01:28:45.988
I am sorry.

01:28:46.155 --> 01:28:47.823
I had to make you see what she is.

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:49.200
Tell him, detective.

01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:50.993
I will tell you, bouc.

01:28:53.454 --> 01:28:55.122
Having observed Rosalie otterbourne,

01:28:55.289 --> 01:28:56.999
having inspected
her books of accounting...

01:28:57.208 --> 01:28:59.168
Yes, lknovv, please forgive me, madame.

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:00.336
What?

01:29:00.503 --> 01:29:02.463
Poirot: I can tell you,
she gambles frequently,

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.006
though frequently wins.

01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:07.551
She drinks little, she tips well,
she pays her employees,

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:10.763
and her taxes on time to the dime.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:13.599
She is diligent, she is forthright.

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:16.143
In business, perhaps even virtuosic.

01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:18.062
Though at piano, sadly, amateur.

01:29:19.939 --> 01:29:23.025
As for her adopted mother,
she drinks to excess twice a week or more.

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:26.111
She smokes cigarettes
of various compositions.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.656
And I believe that at least two
of her marriages were not...

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:30.157
I think, strictly legally ended.

01:29:30.324 --> 01:29:33.536
But she is a magnificent personality.

01:29:33.911 --> 01:29:34.912
Salome: Mm.

01:29:34.995 --> 01:29:38.541
I do not yet know
who murdered linnet Doyle.

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:41.001
But I do know this...

01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:45.923
Rosalie otterbourne is irrevocably in love
with your son and is his better in virtue.

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:48.842
She is more than fit.
She is a find.

01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:54.807
It wasn't enough that we're happy.

01:29:54.974 --> 01:29:58.811
I did not trust her.
Despite the detective, I still don't.

01:29:58.978 --> 01:30:01.564
I love her.
That has to count for something.

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:02.815
Why should it?

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.234
Corinthians had it wrong on every point.

01:30:05.401 --> 01:30:06.902
Love isn't patient or kind.

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:09.822
It envies and boasts and doesn't care
who gets mowed down.

01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:12.324
It angers, it is irritable,
it keeps record

01:30:12.408 --> 01:30:13.768
of every transgression against it,

01:30:13.909 --> 01:30:15.869
and good god, it fails.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:18.706
Sure as a face ages, love fails.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:21.834
He really wants your permission,
but he doesn't need it.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.587
Any more than I need
to meet your standard.

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:26.005
Or yours.

01:30:27.131 --> 01:30:28.966
I've had a chance to observe you.

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:32.928
Wanna know what I make of your character?

01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:39.602
He is obsessive,
is vain, is smug,

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:42.062
is lonely for a reason.

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:46.025
A detestable, tiresome, bombastic,

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:48.152
egocentric little freak.

01:30:49.987 --> 01:30:51.447
How dare you?

01:30:53.407 --> 01:30:54.742
Get out of my way.

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:56.802
- Mademoiselle, if I may.
- Salome: Ooh.

01:30:57.328 --> 01:30:59.830
Miss otterbourne,
I owe you an explanation.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.417
Please. Allow me to apologize.

01:31:03.584 --> 01:31:04.752
Have you ever met a man

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:06.670
who says his own name
as many times

01:31:06.754 --> 01:31:07.963
as hercule poirot...

01:31:29.026 --> 01:31:30.319
Poirot: Confirmed.

01:31:31.445 --> 01:31:33.864
It is Louise bourget.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:35.925
Windlesham:
There's no sign of drowning.

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:37.284
They threw the body in after.

01:31:37.451 --> 01:31:39.828
She must have got caught up in the paddle.

01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:42.247
She was murdered on board.

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:44.541
Within the last hour.

01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:48.337
Money.

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:50.589
Covered in blood.

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:55.260
Louise bourget hinted that

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:59.431
she might have seen
the killer make an escape.

01:32:00.766 --> 01:32:06.563
If indeed she had, she might have
offered her silence for a sum of money.

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:08.399
A blackmail.

01:32:10.567 --> 01:32:13.696
Only the killer preferred
her silence absolute.

01:32:15.781 --> 01:32:18.283
Her throat, cut clean. The blade...

01:32:20.244 --> 01:32:21.245
Shon.

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:24.623
Very sharp. Like a...

01:32:27.626 --> 01:32:28.794
Like a scalpel.

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.091
You!

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:35.718
You killed them!

01:32:36.635 --> 01:32:38.679
It was... it was his scalpel!

01:32:39.388 --> 01:32:41.181
He killed Louise!

01:32:41.348 --> 01:32:43.225
And she saw him leaving linny's cabin.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.103
You've been lying ever since.

01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:49.022
You're the one
linnet should never have trusted.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:52.443
I always told her your firm
was bilking her for millions.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:53.694
You murderer!

01:32:54.945 --> 01:32:56.280
Andrew: I will kill you!

01:32:56.363 --> 01:32:58.323
Rosalie: Hey, stop it!

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:01.326
Windlesham: Get off of me!

01:33:42.534 --> 01:33:44.536
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:46.497
Have some respect!

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:51.668
How many have to die
before you do something?

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:54.379
A throat cut while
you run me over the coals.

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:55.839
He's trying.

01:33:56.006 --> 01:33:57.549
Well, he'd better try harder,

01:33:57.716 --> 01:34:00.219
or we'll all wind up
in an Egyptian jail cell.

01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:05.140
If you won't name the killer, I will.

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:09.812
He loved linnet too much.

01:34:10.521 --> 01:34:11.801
There's your motive right there.

01:34:11.939 --> 01:34:15.192
Look, all of you just keep quiet
and let poirot work.

01:34:15.943 --> 01:34:17.945
In any case,
we'll reach the port by morning.

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.757
For now, it's safest if we
just keep to our own cabins

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:22.407
with the doors locked.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:52.396
Bouc: She was engaged for a time.

01:34:52.896 --> 01:34:54.147
I'll have to write

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:56.984
and let him know that she's...
Gone.

01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:00.279
They broke it off, but he'd want to know.

01:35:01.822 --> 01:35:02.865
That's good of you.

01:35:08.912 --> 01:35:11.582
It's horrible.
All of it, horrible.

01:35:12.708 --> 01:35:14.459
Who could do such a thing?

01:35:15.419 --> 01:35:19.214
You must have some theory,
monsieur poirot.

01:35:22.384 --> 01:35:23.635
Don't you?

01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:26.513
I have one final interview to conduct.

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:33.562
Captain mahmoud: Full speed!

01:35:39.902 --> 01:35:41.653
As I have allowed affection

01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.090
to color the clarity of my thoughts
in your investigation,

01:35:44.114 --> 01:35:46.867
I must ask you to remain
as witness to this interview.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.080
How long did you know linnet Doyle?

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:54.207
I'm a suspect now?

01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:55.727
How long did you know linnet Doyle?

01:35:55.751 --> 01:35:57.461
Bouc: I know your tricks.

01:35:57.628 --> 01:36:00.422
I've seen this play before
from that side of the table.

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:05.636
A long time.

01:36:07.596 --> 01:36:10.349
We weren't close, just familiar.

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:12.768
My parents considered her parents
their equals,

01:36:12.935 --> 01:36:17.898
so we grew up at the same parties
and wound up kissing each other's friends.

01:36:18.065 --> 01:36:20.692
You can't catch me at anything
because I haven't done anything.

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:22.736
So, ask whatever you like.

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:27.157
Where is your coat?

01:36:35.666 --> 01:36:38.543
Why did you not wake linnet
when Simon was shot?

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:39.795
Poirot.

01:36:42.756 --> 01:36:44.007
Poirot: Her husband was shot.

01:36:44.633 --> 01:36:46.468
You have such sympathy
for the former fiance

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.552
of Louise bourget.

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.554
You wish to inform him of her fate.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:52.057
Yet, you do not spare
the same sympathy for linnet.

01:36:52.224 --> 01:36:53.517
I thought she would be asleep.

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:55.811
She said that she had taken
a sleeping pill.

01:36:55.978 --> 01:36:57.437
Poirot: Rubbish!

01:36:57.604 --> 01:37:00.899
God, I was so happy to see you, bouc.

01:37:02.442 --> 01:37:04.611
But you lie to me.

01:37:04.778 --> 01:37:06.780
You lie in my face!

01:37:11.076 --> 01:37:13.328
And now, you make yourself my prey.

01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:16.665
Simon: What happened?
Did he kill linnet?

01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:18.542
Poirot: Was it you
and Rosalie together?

01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:21.503
No, she is honest.
Too proud to live well from theft.

01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:23.672
- You alone did this.
- Bouc: No, I didn't.

01:37:23.839 --> 01:37:26.842
You returned to the parlor alone,
to find the gun and you did.

01:37:27.009 --> 01:37:30.178
You then went to the doyles' cabin
to inform linnet about Simon.

01:37:30.804 --> 01:37:33.849
She was sleeping. You saw the necklace.
You were assaulted by temptation.

01:37:34.016 --> 01:37:35.368
But she woke, catching you,
so you shot her.

01:37:35.392 --> 01:37:36.536
Bouc: No, I didn't. That's not...

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.647
Only Louise bourget saw you leaving
and demanded money.

01:37:40.814 --> 01:37:42.134
Instead, you brought her a blade.

01:37:42.232 --> 01:37:43.912
- Bouc: No, I didn't kill...
- Two murders!

01:37:43.984 --> 01:37:47.988
All to secure a stolen fortune
so you would not need permission to marry,

01:37:48.155 --> 01:37:49.322
only her blessing.

01:37:50.699 --> 01:37:52.159
Bouc: I didn't kill anyone.

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:54.745
I never found a gun.
That's not what happened.

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:59.041
Poirot: No, you did not kill anyone.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:01.001
Linnet Doyle's murder was premeditated.

01:38:01.168 --> 01:38:03.462
It required exact timing, a stolen scarf.

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:07.174
You did not kill her, but
you did go to the doyles' cabin

01:38:07.758 --> 01:38:10.677
and found linnet already dead.

01:38:11.303 --> 01:38:14.264
You knew she had been killed
before all of us.

01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:16.600
But instead of calling for help...

01:38:18.935 --> 01:38:20.228
You took the necklace.

01:38:25.025 --> 01:38:27.819
After I told you of the cabin search,
you attempted to return it.

01:38:27.986 --> 01:38:32.699
But you came upon Louise bourget
arguing with someone, demanding money.

01:38:32.866 --> 01:38:34.659
You saw her throat cut.

01:38:36.161 --> 01:38:38.455
Poirot: You saw her murdered.

01:38:39.289 --> 01:38:40.499
You know who killed Louise?

01:38:40.582 --> 01:38:43.061
Poirot: But you could not say,
not without admitting you stole,

01:38:43.085 --> 01:38:46.838
so you hid it in your mother's room.
Believing that she would catch no blame.

01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:49.341
While you remained silent.

01:38:51.134 --> 01:38:53.428
Only you had Louise bourget's blood
on your coat.

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:06.316
If I admit this, if I say it...

01:39:06.483 --> 01:39:08.318
Poirot: You will face punishment
for theft.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:09.486
You will face prison.

01:39:10.529 --> 01:39:12.239
I'll... I'll lose Rosalie.

01:39:12.405 --> 01:39:14.032
Poirot: She loves you.

01:39:15.242 --> 01:39:16.451
I can't...

01:39:16.618 --> 01:39:19.913
You cannot let a killer go free
to protect yourself.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.168
I wanted to tell you.

01:39:29.089 --> 01:39:30.882
All I thought was how...

01:39:33.802 --> 01:39:35.637
All I thought was how happy we'd be.

01:39:37.305 --> 01:39:39.182
We could run off and get married.

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:42.185
No obligations. We'd be free.

01:39:43.937 --> 01:39:45.147
Stupid!

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:47.691
It was so stupid, I know.

01:39:48.692 --> 01:39:50.152
Who did you see her with?

01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:56.283
You were a terrible friend, poirot.

01:39:57.492 --> 01:39:59.870
Why did you have to teach me to be good?

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:01.037
Who?

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:02.914
You could never understand...

01:40:04.166 --> 01:40:07.085
What people will do for love.

01:40:07.252 --> 01:40:08.253
Come on!

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.468
Mon ami, bouc. Huh?

01:40:15.552 --> 01:40:17.470
Bouc?

01:40:56.885 --> 01:40:58.094
Bowers: I heard gunshots.

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:01.223
- I heard a shot.
- What's going on?

01:41:02.307 --> 01:41:03.558
Simon: Did you catch him?

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:05.894
Poirot, did you catch whoever it was?

01:41:32.504 --> 01:41:33.755
What is it?

01:41:34.297 --> 01:41:35.840
Was someone hurt?

01:41:48.353 --> 01:41:53.108
I have never seen anyone so happy as he...

01:41:54.985 --> 01:41:56.695
When he was with you.

01:42:01.658 --> 01:42:05.161
Rosalie: He told me how much he hoped
you'd be happy one day, too.

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:11.167
That you'd get tired of being
just a pure cold detective.

01:42:13.128 --> 01:42:14.838
Be human instead.

01:42:22.012 --> 01:42:23.763
I don't want you happy.

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:33.023
I want you to find who did this.

01:43:23.406 --> 01:43:25.051
Salome:
It was your gun that shot him.

01:43:25.075 --> 01:43:26.368
It was his gun!

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:28.286
Andrew: I was in here!
Salome: His gun!

01:43:28.578 --> 01:43:30.705
Andrew: I was here.

01:43:30.789 --> 01:43:32.789
Andrew: Well, you were there.
You saw me. Tell her.

01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:34.436
Windlesham: It's true. He was in here.

01:43:34.501 --> 01:43:35.502
Salome: No.

01:43:35.585 --> 01:43:38.254
My pistol was in my suitcase
in my cabin and...

01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:40.840
Salome: Why would you leave your gun
with a killer on board?

01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:42.175
Andrew: Because...

01:43:43.176 --> 01:43:45.345
We'd be at port by sunrise.

01:43:45.512 --> 01:43:48.515
If the local police saw a dark man
holding a gun,

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:51.059
they'd shoot me before I ever saw a noose.

01:44:01.111 --> 01:44:03.363
You have failed...

01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:07.200
Your every duty.

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:10.537
His friend.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:13.123
Poirot: I did fail.

01:44:14.207 --> 01:44:15.417
Linnet Doyle.

01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:17.794
Louise bourget.

01:44:18.628 --> 01:44:19.671
Bouc.

01:44:20.755 --> 01:44:23.049
I will not fail him now.

01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:39.774
The murderer is here.

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:44.946
And will stay here.

01:45:02.547 --> 01:45:04.799
Miss otterbourne is right. I love to talk.

01:45:04.966 --> 01:45:06.092
An audience.

01:45:06.259 --> 01:45:07.343
I am vain, you see.

01:45:08.261 --> 01:45:10.972
I love people to hear me
bring the solution to a crime and say,

01:45:11.139 --> 01:45:13.475
"see, how clever is hercule poirot."

01:45:14.225 --> 01:45:18.730
When all I want now,
would give anything for...

01:45:20.523 --> 01:45:23.109
Is one conversation...

01:45:23.276 --> 01:45:24.611
With bouc.

01:45:25.445 --> 01:45:28.406
I would stomp about and say,
"around a person like linnet Doyle

01:45:28.573 --> 01:45:31.284
"there are so many conflicting hates
and jealousies.

01:45:31.451 --> 01:45:33.578
"It is like the cloud of flies,
buzzing, buzzing."

01:45:33.745 --> 01:45:35.121
And he would laugh at me.

01:45:35.288 --> 01:45:38.082
"Then play your clever games,"
he would say.

01:45:38.249 --> 01:45:40.919
"Ask your questions
till the right one comes."

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:44.923
"Who would want to kill her?

01:45:45.089 --> 01:45:46.174
"Who could have?"

01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:47.735
And then, I would ask and I would see.

01:45:47.759 --> 01:45:51.012
Yes, bouc showed me too late.

01:45:51.763 --> 01:45:54.140
A person in love will do anything.

01:45:55.308 --> 01:45:57.685
Love makes us do reckless things.
Rash things.

01:45:57.852 --> 01:45:58.978
A Boulder falls, rash.

01:45:59.145 --> 01:46:00.939
Louise murdered, wild.
Bouc, shot.

01:46:03.316 --> 01:46:06.361
I had believed the identity
of madame Doyle's killer was obvious.

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:13.868
Cousin Andrew katchadourian.

01:46:17.789 --> 01:46:20.416
Poirot: Doing as he did
at the temple ofabu simbel,

01:46:20.583 --> 01:46:22.585
where he wandered off alone, desperate.

01:46:22.752 --> 01:46:25.432
Where he saw an opportunity.
Hoping to hide his sins under a rock...

01:46:29.342 --> 01:46:30.343
He pushes one.

01:46:33.471 --> 01:46:36.474
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:44.440
I wasn't... I wasn't thinking.

01:46:46.526 --> 01:46:48.403
I saw them below.

01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:53.408
And... and thank god I missed.

01:46:54.242 --> 01:46:56.077
And you must all know...

01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:00.623
I didn't kill her.
I would never do that.

01:47:01.499 --> 01:47:02.500
I... I loved her.

01:47:05.044 --> 01:47:06.421
I didn't kill her!

01:47:06.588 --> 01:47:07.672
No, he did not.

01:47:08.923 --> 01:47:11.843
Linnet Doyle's murder was not a wild act.
It was methodically planned.

01:47:12.010 --> 01:47:14.095
The details, the times,
the bullets, the alibis.

01:47:14.262 --> 01:47:16.222
But planned by who?

01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:19.851
I turn to bouc once more.

01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:22.520
Why did you paint him in a green jacket?

01:47:22.687 --> 01:47:24.606
He wore red on the pyramid.

01:47:25.607 --> 01:47:27.525
My red paint went missing.

01:47:28.026 --> 01:47:29.652
Poirot: It was stolen

01:47:30.361 --> 01:47:33.156
by linnet Doyle's murderer.

01:47:33.781 --> 01:47:37.577
By her husband, Simon Doyle.

01:47:41.456 --> 01:47:42.707
That's ridiculous.

01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:44.042
How could he? He was shot.

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:45.644
Poirot: Yes, he was shot.
We know this for certain.

01:47:45.668 --> 01:47:47.795
What we do not know for certain
is when he was shot.

01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:50.715
Or what he did in the moments
after we believed that he was.

01:47:51.716 --> 01:47:52.800
Consider...

01:47:52.967 --> 01:47:55.487
Madame Doyle reported her husband was
cross with Louise over some nail Polish

01:47:55.511 --> 01:47:57.263
left at the hotel.
Why should he care?

01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:59.849
Because madame Doyle wore
blood red nail Polish,

01:48:00.016 --> 01:48:01.809
which had, for him, an intended use.

01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:03.895
This gone,
madame bouc's paint would have to do.

01:48:04.062 --> 01:48:06.702
He also did not expect his wife
to invite a detective to the party.

01:48:06.814 --> 01:48:09.776
So, to be safe, he puts me to sleep.
A single glass of champagne

01:48:09.942 --> 01:48:12.612
at his insistence sends me to my bed
with my head spinning.

01:48:12.779 --> 01:48:14.530
Drugged for his performance.

01:48:14.697 --> 01:48:16.407
Miss otterbourne, you saw a gun fired.

01:48:17.784 --> 01:48:18.785
You saw Simon collapse.

01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:21.621
A blood-soaked handkerchief to his leg.
At which point you left him.

01:48:21.788 --> 01:48:23.414
Busy with Jackie and finding the doctor.

01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:25.261
This gives the murderer but moments alone.

01:48:25.333 --> 01:48:28.211
Moments are all he needs.
He picks up the pistol.

01:48:30.296 --> 01:48:32.173
He runs to his wife's cabin.

01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:37.345
Simon...

01:48:38.304 --> 01:48:39.406
Poirot: And he shoots her,

01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:40.431
through the temple.

01:48:41.933 --> 01:48:44.060
There were scorch marks
on linnet Doyle's wounds.

01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:46.020
The missing scarf
would have eliminated them,

01:48:46.104 --> 01:48:47.188
but it was not used on her.

01:48:47.355 --> 01:48:50.274
It was instead used here
to muffle the sound of another shot.

01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:52.252
- What's the matter, bouc?
- There's been an accident.

01:48:52.276 --> 01:48:53.486
Poirot: He returns here

01:48:53.653 --> 01:48:56.614
to retrieve the scarf
which he had previously hidden.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:00.034
Where he took the gun one more time
and fired it into his own leg.

01:49:03.413 --> 01:49:04.932
Poirot: After which,
he replaced one bullet

01:49:04.956 --> 01:49:06.332
into the gun so if it was found,

01:49:06.499 --> 01:49:07.625
we could count not three,

01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:09.836
but the two shots
that we believed had been fired.

01:49:10.336 --> 01:49:13.297
He then wraps the handkerchief,
the scarf, and the gun

01:49:13.464 --> 01:49:16.259
and throws them
into the waters of the nile.

01:49:17.343 --> 01:49:19.929
Then makes himself ready
for the arrival of Dr. Windlesham.

01:49:20.096 --> 01:49:21.472
Simon: She shot me!

01:49:21.639 --> 01:49:23.516
I can't move my leg.

01:49:24.517 --> 01:49:27.395
Your alibi secured, you avoid suspicion.

01:49:27.478 --> 01:49:29.439
Indeed, you ensured
a multitude of suspects.

01:49:29.605 --> 01:49:31.886
Encouraging a guest list
not merely of friends and family,

01:49:31.941 --> 01:49:34.986
but exclusively those carrying grudge
or grievance against your wife.

01:49:35.153 --> 01:49:36.154
Even our entertainment.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.573
All passing
as a new husband's thoughtfulness.

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.826
Blame deflected in every direction
except at you.

01:49:44.287 --> 01:49:46.330
You are mad.

01:49:46.914 --> 01:49:52.670
That I would shoot myself,
and then somehow kill Louise and bouc.

01:49:54.005 --> 01:49:57.133
He's right. He couldn't have killed them.

01:49:57.633 --> 01:49:59.135
He did not kill them.

01:49:59.969 --> 01:50:03.222
The second and third murders
were committed

01:50:03.306 --> 01:50:04.546
by his accomplice in the first,

01:50:04.724 --> 01:50:09.979
and, I believe, by the mastermind
behind this entire ingenious plot.

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.442
Jacqueline de bellefort.

01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:21.157
His lover once. His lover still.

01:50:21.908 --> 01:50:24.952
Introducing the couple. Stalking them.
Finding them aboard this ship.

01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:27.288
Shooting Simon with a blank.

01:50:27.455 --> 01:50:30.082
All to create two unassailable alibis.

01:50:30.249 --> 01:50:31.977
The grieving husband
left to inherit his wife's fortune

01:50:32.001 --> 01:50:34.545
and then, in time,
to marry the woman he loves.

01:50:35.463 --> 01:50:37.465
Has always loved.

01:50:38.132 --> 01:50:41.761
When I asked Louise bourget if she had
seen anything, she gave a curious answer.

01:50:41.928 --> 01:50:45.139
"If I had come outside my cabin,
I might have seen the killer."

01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:49.393
Not yes, not no,
but a veiled threat to linnet's killer,

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.395
who was present in the room.

01:50:51.938 --> 01:50:53.356
Simon Doyle.

01:50:53.523 --> 01:50:56.526
Who then assured her that Louise
would be taken care of.

01:50:56.692 --> 01:50:57.902
Indeed, she was.

01:50:58.069 --> 01:51:01.531
As soon as he was able, Simon,
no doubt, sent a message to Jacqueline,

01:51:01.697 --> 01:51:04.242
warning her of the new danger.

01:51:04.408 --> 01:51:06.410
Telling her where to find a weapon.

01:51:08.412 --> 01:51:09.747
And then, when bouc...

01:51:23.177 --> 01:51:28.641
When bouc detected who had killed Louise,
Simon shouted...

01:51:28.808 --> 01:51:29.809
Simon: Come on!

01:51:30.393 --> 01:51:34.105
A warning to his accessory...

01:51:37.692 --> 01:51:40.444
Who shot bouc through the throat.

01:51:42.947 --> 01:51:47.869
Before he could reveal
Jacqueline de bellefort.

01:51:48.411 --> 01:51:51.330
You killed my son?

01:51:52.582 --> 01:51:53.749
I'll see you die for this.

01:51:53.833 --> 01:51:54.876
Rosie, please.

01:51:55.251 --> 01:51:56.669
I swear it.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:51:59.547
I swear it.

01:52:02.383 --> 01:52:03.968
You can't all believe him.

01:52:05.344 --> 01:52:06.762
He has no proof.

01:52:06.929 --> 01:52:11.183
Poirot: True. I have only a sunken gun
wiped of fingerprints, yes.

01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:13.185
But it came with a gift.

01:52:13.352 --> 01:52:14.896
The handkerchief.

01:52:15.938 --> 01:52:18.024
The warm waters of the nile in springtime

01:52:18.107 --> 01:52:20.776
would set the color of blood
to a dull brown.

01:52:21.402 --> 01:52:26.365
In those same mysterious waters,
carmine red paint will fade...

01:52:27.366 --> 01:52:28.951
To pink.

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:49.096
Oh, how clever is hercule poirot.

01:52:50.389 --> 01:52:52.934
Was the ambition his or yours?

01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:03.277
He needed things.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:08.741
I needed him.

01:53:09.325 --> 01:53:11.285
Poirot: You never cared for money.

01:53:11.452 --> 01:53:12.596
But you could deny him nothing.

01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.998
Not even a plan
when he could not devise his own.

01:53:23.005 --> 01:53:24.165
Jackie: Simon, what do we do?

01:53:24.256 --> 01:53:25.299
Let's go.

01:53:25.466 --> 01:53:26.693
They'll take us in.
We'll be separated.

01:53:26.717 --> 01:53:28.803
We get off the boat now and we run.

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:30.346
Come on.

01:53:31.806 --> 01:53:34.225
Jackie: It's all right, Simon.
Give it to me.

01:53:35.476 --> 01:53:36.560
Uh-uh.

01:53:42.775 --> 01:53:45.319
Listen to me.

01:53:45.486 --> 01:53:46.529
We can make it.

01:53:46.696 --> 01:53:49.407
We've got to go now,
and we've got to be strong.

01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:51.867
We can be strong.

01:53:52.326 --> 01:53:53.661
We can be strong.

01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:20.855
I love you.

01:55:27.421 --> 01:55:29.840
I am sorry you have become so wealthy.

01:55:29.924 --> 01:55:31.509
Ah, nothing I can't fix.

01:55:31.675 --> 01:55:33.427
We mightjust keep some.

01:55:34.095 --> 01:55:35.096
Come on.

01:55:38.933 --> 01:55:40.643
They will arrest me now?

01:55:43.562 --> 01:55:46.107
So long as you settle her affairs honestly

01:55:46.732 --> 01:55:48.859
and pay back what you owe.

01:55:57.535 --> 01:55:59.078
You return to London, doctor?

01:55:59.495 --> 01:56:01.956
There's nothing for me in London anymore.

01:56:02.665 --> 01:56:04.083
West Africa.

01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:05.876
Perhaps I can do some good there.

01:56:45.249 --> 01:56:47.585
I wish I'd never got to see you work.

01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:59.513
Perhaps...

01:57:53.359 --> 01:57:54.794
- See you soon, Syd.
- Thanks a lot for tonight.

01:57:54.818 --> 01:57:55.903
See you in a couple days.

01:57:57.154 --> 01:58:00.274
Blondin: Tell the band one more song,
then they have to finish their rehearsal.

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.201
Watch it, mister.

01:58:09.208 --> 01:58:11.877
When the storm

01:58:18.133 --> 01:58:23.264
Of life is raging

01:58:27.017 --> 01:58:30.396
stand by me

01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:44.743
When the storm

01:58:44.910 --> 01:58:46.328
we're closed, mate.

01:58:47.454 --> 01:58:51.750
Of life is raging

01:58:56.380 --> 01:59:00.342
stand by me

01:59:05.222 --> 01:59:09.393
when this world

01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:16.233
ls tossing me

01:59:19.903 --> 01:59:21.822
whoa

01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:26.827
-man: Hey, hey, hey, hey
-like a ship

01:59:26.994 --> 01:59:28.662
oh, yeah

01:59:28.871 --> 01:59:33.208
out on the sea

01:59:38.172 --> 01:59:41.925
Stand

01:59:42.092 --> 01:59:47.139
by me
