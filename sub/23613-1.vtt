This is Sam Campbell, your boss.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.124

00:44.086 --> 00:46.180
Hey, McClane, be reasonable.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.173
(Screams)

00:50.592 --> 00:53.562
McClane, open up.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.645
Fuck you and your bloody company!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.815
(Yelling)

01:02.479 --> 01:04.447
You little maggot piece of shit.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.908
You're going to regret this.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.415
(Screams)

01:37.222 --> 01:39.600
(indistinct voices on tape)

01:49.109 --> 01:50.656
(Groans)

01:51.945 --> 01:54.039
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:54.156 --> 01:55.908
(Tape stops)

01:56.617 --> 01:58.415
Me?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.381
I'm just another chunk of meat...

02:04.916 --> 02:08.136
lost in brainland.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.931
Oh, shit.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.556
Don't you dare to do that.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.978
Put it down.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.192
I said, "put it down".

02:39.785 --> 02:42.004
You're fired!

02:53.840 --> 02:56.639
(Clock ticking)

02:59.763 --> 03:04.439
(Speaking Swedish)

04:49.706 --> 04:52.630
(Boss on PA)
'Edward, can you come in for a moment?'

05:02.511 --> 05:03.854
Yes?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.478
- Edward, I've been asked...
- (Intercom buzzes)

05:07.599 --> 05:10.603
(Secretary) 'Sir, I have
a Milan Milanovich on the line.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.230
'Will you take the call, sir?'

05:14.314 --> 05:16.567
No. Er...

05:16.691 --> 05:19.114
I'll call him back later.

05:21.029 --> 05:26.331
Edward, I've been asked to lend you
to another department.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.756
You'll get your instructions from, er...

05:31.581 --> 05:35.006
from this fine, young man.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.348
Er... Samuel Campbell.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.785
(Phone ringing)

06:08.910 --> 06:10.958
That's great.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.968
(Man on TV)
'It's molesting time.'

06:17.085 --> 06:20.009
Oh, I'm Sam Campbell.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.882
Welcome to the team.
Have a seat.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.720
So, this is the Splatter and Gore
Department.

06:25.844 --> 06:30.020
Yes, it is. But right now, I'd rather call it
the "Loose Limbs" Department.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.778
European distributors have bought
the whole "Loose Limbs" series.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.320
We're planning on showing Part One
all over Europe next spring.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.692
I don't understand.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.784
It's big.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.747
It's real big. It is huge.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.617
It's a $100 million deal.

06:49.409 --> 06:54.461
- But why have you...
- I personally think it's sad and very wrong.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.003
But as you know, of course,

06:56.124 --> 06:59.048
there is legislation in some
of the European countries

06:59.169 --> 07:01.888
that forces us to cut down a bit
on the violence in these films.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.384
- You want me to...
- We're running a very tight schedule here.

07:05.508 --> 07:09.012
I need all the extra resources I can get.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.266
I want you to get started
as soon as possible.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.440
- Let's say...
- (Man on TV) 'God, you're bleeding bad!

07:16.561 --> 07:18.905
'Would you like me
to cut off the other one, too?'

07:19.022 --> 07:20.069
On Monday?

07:20.982 --> 07:24.077
Are you sure I'm really qualified
for this kind of work?

07:24.194 --> 07:26.868
- You're just the man I need, Eddie.
- (Woman on TV screaming)

07:26.988 --> 07:28.911
You're perfect.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.252
I have a little house just outside town.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.716
Since we are just a tad
short of space here,

07:37.832 --> 07:40.506
I've arranged for you to work there.

07:40.627 --> 07:44.473
It is a little inconvenient,
but you'll manage, right?

07:45.090 --> 07:48.720
And remember, like we say here
at Splatter and Gore Department,

07:48.843 --> 07:50.641
you keep 'em heads rollin', hear?

07:51.262 --> 07:53.185
(Woman on TV screaming)

08:04.901 --> 08:06.323
(Woman on TV sobbing)

08:06.444 --> 08:09.038
(Chainsaw running, man laughing)

08:09.155 --> 08:10.998
(Woman screaming)

08:25.088 --> 08:26.965
(Phone ringing)

08:30.593 --> 08:33.972
European Distributors,
Edward Tor Swenson.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.520
- (Woman) 'Hi, darling.'
- Hello, Barbara.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.645
'So how's work going?
I... I'm not interrupting you, am I?'

08:40.645 --> 08:41.897
Nah, it's OK.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.899
'You never talk about work.
Is it that awful?'

08:44.024 --> 08:45.241
- No.
- 'Tell me.'

08:45.358 --> 08:46.780
No, trust me, honey,
you don't want to know.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.278
- 'Yes, I do.'
- Believe...

08:48.403 --> 08:51.327
'Edward, I'm not a child,
so don't treat me like one, OK?'

08:51.448 --> 08:52.916
OK.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.705
In this film, there's a scene
where a woman gets raped by a beaver

08:57.829 --> 08:59.923
and then shot in the head
with a bazooka.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.463
'Oh, Edward, that's disgusting.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.508
- 'I can't believe you're telling me this.'
- Honey...

09:05.628 --> 09:08.051
'Well, it's awful. A beaver?
It's perverted.'

09:08.173 --> 09:10.676
Honey, I'm doing it
for a good cause.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.269
'I know.
And I love you for that.

09:14.095 --> 09:17.349
- 'Of course, I love you anyway.'
- I love you, too.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.852
'And you won't forget about
Emmy's birthday party next Sunday?'

09:19.976 --> 09:21.398
No, no, I won't forget.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.112
- 'Promise?'
- I promise.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.731
- 'Are you sure?'
- I'll be there.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.702
- 'And I thought we could start at 5.'
- Yeah, 5pm.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.820
- 'Don't be late.'
- Sharp.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.447
- 'Take care now.'
- OK.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.792
- 'And don't work too hard. Love you.'
- I love you, too.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.456
'Bye.'

10:08.233 --> 10:11.737
Come on, hon,
show me what you got.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.870
Do you like what you see, darling?

10:20.995 --> 10:24.090
(Retches) Well, yeah.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.139
Do you like my body, baby?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.638
Yeah, I... I want your body.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.432
Come on, baby.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.729
You can have it.

10:43.852 --> 10:46.901
Well, not all of it.
I think I'll settle for an arm.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.942
"An arm"?

10:54.112 --> 10:55.284
(Screams)

10:55.405 --> 10:57.123
(Woman screams)

11:08.835 --> 11:10.212
(Tape stops)

11:39.407 --> 11:41.284
Do you like what you see, darling?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.707
(Retches) Well, yeah.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.886

11:56.007 --> 11:58.385

12:06.059 --> 12:09.359
(Woman on screen) 'I don't feel a thing.
ls the nail gone now, Dr Wrench?'

12:13.024 --> 12:15.743
'Soon, my love, soon.'

12:15.860 --> 12:17.157
(Strains)

12:17.278 --> 12:19.372
- Yes!
- Cool!

12:19.489 --> 12:20.832
(Woman on screen) 'My foot!'

12:20.949 --> 12:23.577
(Dr Wrench)
'Well, hey, don't thank me.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.953
'Thank science.'

12:25.078 --> 12:26.796
- (Screaming)
- Hi, Mel.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.216
Hi. Hi, honey.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.169
(Screaming on screen continues)

12:33.294 --> 12:36.924
- Hi, baby, what's up?
- Not much. What are you guys watching?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.641
"Loose Limbs 5".

12:39.384 --> 12:41.057
Yeah!

12:41.177 --> 12:43.054
Really, Nick,
can I ask you something?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.648
Do you always have to watch
these kind of films?

12:47.141 --> 12:50.270
Nah, I'm not all fucked up...

12:53.106 --> 12:54.574
“Vet.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.198
(Growling)

12:58.236 --> 13:00.910
Stop it, Nick. Nick, stop it.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.625
Nick, stop it. Who do you think you are?
Hannibal the Cannibal?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.961
(Nick growls, Mel chuckles)

13:08.246 --> 13:10.374
Thank you.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.592
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.177
(Screaming on screen continues)

13:15.003 --> 13:18.257
Hey, Nick, where are you?

13:19.340 --> 13:20.933
Hmm... here, Mr Campbell.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.512
I hired a new editor
for the "Loose Limbs" series.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.605
I think he's pretty well set up
for a while.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.772
But I want you... yeah, you

13:29.892 --> 13:32.691
to be responsible for delivering new films
when he needs them.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.110
Sure thing, Mr Campbell.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.620
- Whoa.
- Damn.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.536
- (Sam) Hey, Nick.
- Yes, Mr Campbell?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.292
Don't you screw it up.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.703
No, Mr Campbell.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.380
(Screaming on-screen)

13:55.501 --> 13:57.378
Whoa!

13:57.503 --> 13:59.676
- (Mel) 'It's disgusting.'
- (Nick) 'Funky.'

15:20.545 --> 15:23.094

15:23.214 --> 15:25.763

17:01.812 --> 17:03.814
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, honey, how are you doing?

17:03.940 --> 17:05.066
- I'm like cool.
- Fine.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.864
- You know, I missed you today.
- I missed you too.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.736
- You know, the day has just been...
- Uh-huh.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.488
I got so much to do.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.833
Why is "Loose Limbs 8" in my office
when it should be with Eddie?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.207
Number 8?

17:17.328 --> 17:20.127
Urn, that's because, urn...

17:21.790 --> 17:23.338
...er, I forgot.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.799
You are a piece of shit.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.262
- Yes, sir.
- You'd better go now.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.007
Yes, sir.

17:33.803 --> 17:34.850
Any. . -

17:38.724 --> 17:40.647
Are there any messages for me,
Melanie?

17:41.644 --> 17:44.614
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry, sir.
There's no messages for you today.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.416
- Yuck.
- My God, he's so disgusting, you know?

17:55.533 --> 17:58.207
- I'm so glad he's not my boss.
- Well, he's mine.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.171
The way he's pushing me around
from morning till evening, you know?

18:01.289 --> 18:03.758
Like every fucking day, you know?
I can't believe this.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.549
The way he walks in - he stares,
and he's really disgusting, you know?

18:07.670 --> 18:10.674
And he smells so awful.
And he smokes a lot.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.800
- Uh-huh.
- I can't believe he treats you this way.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.100
(Man on TV screams)

18:17.972 --> 18:21.818
(Monster on TV)
'Come on, punk. Make my day.'

18:23.728 --> 18:25.901
- (Gunshot)
- Oh, hi, Eddie.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.692
Come on in, come on in.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.154
So, Eddie, what's your problem?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.581
I... I don't feel so good.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.245
I don't know what's happening to me.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.754
I'm not sure if this job...

18:46.709 --> 18:49.053
the violence, or the blood...

18:50.171 --> 18:52.924
I don't know if I'm able
to continue with...

18:53.049 --> 18:55.848
Well, Edward, neither do I.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.262
So you tell me.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.604
I want my old job back.

19:05.019 --> 19:08.319
These films,
they give me the creeps.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.239
Don't forget your appointment at 10,
Mr Campbell.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.832
I won't, honey.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.700
(Man on TV choking)

19:24.288 --> 19:26.336
Edward...

19:26.457 --> 19:31.839
I think it's important that you and I
are open and honest with each other.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.301
You see,
I'm not your mother or shrink.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.302
I'm your boss.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.431
I don't need to know
your emotional state of mind.

19:41.555 --> 19:45.401
What I need is results,
Edward, results.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.146
And if you can't give me those results,
you tell me, hear?

19:49.480 --> 19:52.233
Because if not,
I'll have you fired.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.572
- But Mr Campbell, you can't mean that...
- Nice talking to you, Edward.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.949
Have a nice day.
