WEBVTT

00:00.506 --> 00:03.709
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:04.378 --> 00:07.097
It appears the ship now
possesses a will of its own.

00:07.166 --> 00:10.721
It also seems to be doing
a better job of decoding the

00:10.789 --> 00:13.355
project Iacon database than we were.

00:13.424 --> 00:18.522
Regain control of this vessel
by any means necessary.

00:18.590 --> 00:19.755
This could be our only chance

00:19.824 --> 00:22.825
to slip aboard and download the
Iacon database.

00:22.893 --> 00:24.897
Why is the warship
heading for Manhattan?

00:24.966 --> 00:26.568
The Iacon relics landed on

00:26.637 --> 00:30.077
Earth eons ago, long before the
city was built atop it.

00:32.014 --> 00:35.119
Agent Fowler! That's
all that's been downloaded?!

00:35.187 --> 00:37.290
Run for it!

00:37.359 --> 00:39.558
Come on!
Here's our ride!

00:39.627 --> 00:43.098
The download of the Iacon
database may have been incomplete,

00:43.226 --> 00:47.169
but we now possess four
sets of coordinates decoded by the ship.

00:47.237 --> 00:50.972
Then we must act quickly, for
Megatron will not hesitate

00:51.041 --> 00:56.243
to obtain the potential doomsday
devices which lie at the site of each.

00:56.244 --> 00:59.244
<b>2x12 - Tunnel Vision</b>

01:00.781 --> 01:04.253
If we are to have any hope of
recovering the Iacon relics

01:04.321 --> 01:09.594
before the Decepticons do,
we must divide our resources.

01:09.663 --> 01:14.468
But, Optimus, when it comes to numbers,
we are already at a grave disadvantage.

01:14.536 --> 01:19.476
Under the circumstances,
swiftness of action is paramount.

01:19.545 --> 01:25.685
This is one race that we
absolutely cannot afford to lose.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074

01:34.532 --> 01:37.201
Dispatching multiple
squadrons will enable us

01:37.270 --> 01:40.573
to pursue all four
coordinates simultaneously.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.276
Lord Megatron, I have
assembled the mining detail you

01:43.345 --> 01:45.847
requested for the first
set of coordinates.

01:45.916 --> 01:50.018
Breakdown and I enjoyed previous
success retrieving Iacon relics.

01:50.087 --> 01:54.757
In memory of my fallen comrade,
I intend to do the same again.

01:54.826 --> 01:59.262
This is a mission, not one of
your racing excursions.

01:59.331 --> 02:00.564
Stop your preening!

02:00.632 --> 02:03.199
Move quickly and operate
with a surgeon's skill!

02:03.268 --> 02:05.436
Do you understand me, Knockout?!

02:06.506 --> 02:08.773
Explicitly, lord Megatron.

02:08.841 --> 02:11.976
Now, since the unfortunate
loss of Breakdown has left you

02:12.045 --> 02:19.750
rather vulnerable, you will
require appropriate support.

02:24.758 --> 02:26.992
How very... repellant.

02:30.634 --> 02:33.657
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

03:15.231 --> 03:17.666
Here's a twist.
It would appear that

03:17.734 --> 03:20.602
the Decepticons
have retreated from Manhattan.

03:20.671 --> 03:23.004
They just... up and left?

03:31.914 --> 03:34.881
Without busting up a city
block to get to it?

03:34.950 --> 03:36.716
They used subway tunnels.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.485
New York has a whole network of
them running beneath the city.

03:39.554 --> 03:42.755
Since the human population no
longer seems to be directly

03:42.824 --> 03:47.459
threatened, maintaining our
disguise will be necessary.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.528
Arcee, Bumblebee, you are the

03:49.597 --> 03:54.033
best choices to navigate through
such a densely populated area.

03:54.102 --> 03:56.769
Optimus, New York has more
than 8 million people.

03:56.838 --> 03:58.904
The odds of being spotted by at
least one of them are pretty high,

03:58.973 --> 04:01.941
even if they are headed underground.

04:02.143 --> 04:06.446
- Where are you going with this?
- You're gonna need a face man.

04:06.515 --> 04:08.782
Someone who can speak
on their behalf.

04:08.851 --> 04:12.386
A human who can run interference
if their cover gets blown.

04:12.454 --> 04:15.222
Well, I've actually been in
subway stations.

04:15.291 --> 04:21.160
I grew up in a major metropolis, unlike
Mr. "I've never been outside Jasper, Nevada".

04:21.228 --> 04:22.761
I have been to Cybertron.

04:22.830 --> 04:27.132
Cybertron doesn't have subways.
Does it?

04:27.200 --> 04:32.136
Agent Fowler's field experience
makes him our best candidate.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.606
Banana fish!

04:34.674 --> 04:40.146
If he weren't still recovering for
his encounter with the Decepticon warship.

04:40.214 --> 04:45.585
Which we survived without incident.

04:45.654 --> 04:50.558
Very well. Miko and Jack will
accompany Arcee and Bumblebee.

04:50.626 --> 04:52.693
Yes!

04:52.762 --> 04:57.732
Initiate transport, and triangulate
coordinates of the other three relics.

05:20.055 --> 05:23.290
- Whoa.
- Of course, it's no Cybertron...

05:23.359 --> 05:26.493
All right, face, how do we
get underground?

05:26.562 --> 05:29.896
Well, you can't just jump the
turnstiles and hope no one notices.

05:33.501 --> 05:37.736
Check it out!
Construction.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.338
A fact of life in the big city.

05:50.315 --> 05:51.449
Bumblebee, don't move!

05:53.186 --> 05:54.252
The third rail.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.888
It carries electricity to power
the subway trains.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.758
One touch and zap!
You're fried.

06:04.966 --> 06:08.301
He must have learned about
that on TV or something.

06:14.676 --> 06:17.043
Could we please pick up the pace?

06:17.112 --> 06:20.646
The humidity down here is threatening
to corrode my undercarriage.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.949
Must you hover?!

06:32.291 --> 06:33.625
Are we getting any closer?

06:33.694 --> 06:36.161
Triangulating the coordinates
is one thing...

06:36.230 --> 06:39.265
but figuring out how to reach
them through this maze is another.

06:49.043 --> 06:50.544
Drilling.

06:50.613 --> 06:54.447
- It's coming from this way!
- Miko!

07:01.989 --> 07:03.623
Miko, what is your ...

07:03.624 --> 07:05.258
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

07:05.327 --> 07:06.326
- Scrap.
- Scrap.

07:06.395 --> 07:08.728
<i>What are you kids doing down here?</i>

07:08.797 --> 07:13.800
We're... on a field trip...
with our school. But we got lost.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.368
<i>Oh, really?</i>

07:15.437 --> 07:18.639
I told him we should stay
with our group, but Leonard here

07:18.707 --> 07:23.576
- ...insisted we search for fossils.
- My bad.

07:23.645 --> 07:27.680
I want to go home.
can you help us, mister...

07:27.749 --> 07:29.348
<i>Vogel.</i>

07:29.417 --> 07:33.686
But you can call me Vogel.

07:33.755 --> 07:36.623
So, ever ride a sweeper train?

07:43.934 --> 07:45.800
Face.

07:50.140 --> 07:54.543
And this section was added in the
'30s as part of a public-works project.

07:54.612 --> 07:56.945
Fascinating.

07:57.014 --> 07:59.949
But these old tunnels have a
dark side, too.

08:00.018 --> 08:02.885
Strange creatures have been said
to lurk down here.

08:02.953 --> 08:10.092
Giant snakes, albino alligators,
even mole men.

08:10.161 --> 08:12.361
Well, but those are just
people who live down here

08:12.429 --> 08:14.529
because they have no
place else to go, right?

08:14.598 --> 08:17.232
That's what the media wants
you to believe.

08:17.301 --> 08:21.070
But I say,
they're from outer space.

08:26.112 --> 08:31.582
I'm telling you, Area 51's got
nothin' on this place.

08:31.651 --> 08:34.753
The aliens are down here,
building up their army,

08:34.754 --> 08:37.855
plotting to use us
humans as slave labor.

08:40.494 --> 08:43.294
Aliens, huh?

08:43.363 --> 08:45.931
If he only knew.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.769
I'm picking up a locator beacon.
The 'Cons have unearthed the relic.

09:05.017 --> 09:08.286
Well?
Let me see it already!

09:13.926 --> 09:15.426
Lock and load.

09:48.987 --> 09:51.755
<i>Attack, already!</i>

09:51.824 --> 09:53.690
I'll get the relic!

10:08.741 --> 10:11.842
You have lovely features,
perfect for a painful little

10:11.911 --> 10:14.446
procedure I call
the nip and tuck.

10:18.319 --> 10:23.589
Dodge and kick.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.346
Shock and drop.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.226
- Uh...
- This way.

11:00.295 --> 11:02.517
How do you know?

11:04.050 --> 11:05.931
- Miko, let's think this through.
- Why?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.068
'Cause you think I don't know
what I'm doing?

11:09.137 --> 11:14.374
"I'm Jack! Optimus picked me to go to
Cybertron, so I must know everything!"

11:14.443 --> 11:15.742
Okay, Miko, seriously ...

11:15.811 --> 11:19.813
if that's what's bugging you, then
why didn't you say something before?

11:19.881 --> 11:23.216
- I've been holding it in.
- Since when do you hold anything in?

11:23.918 --> 11:26.119
Look, it's not like
you don't contribute.

11:26.188 --> 11:30.190
Just yesterday, you helped take
down a psychotic Decepticon warship.

11:30.258 --> 11:31.958
This isn't a competition!
I ...

11:32.027 --> 11:33.326
<i>Lost, huh?</i>

11:33.395 --> 11:38.431
You two are gonna have to explain
yourselves to the New York transit authority.

11:38.500 --> 11:46.505
- I think we should tell him the truth.
- Right. The truth is...

11:47.200 --> 11:48.341
we lost our dog.

11:48.410 --> 11:53.112
- You're wasting your breath.
- The real truth.

11:53.181 --> 11:56.148
We're trying to prevent aliens
from digging up a powerful

11:56.217 --> 12:00.286
ancient relic so they can't use
it to destroy our planet.

12:00.354 --> 12:05.591
I swore I heard something weird
and high-pitched earlier today...

12:05.660 --> 12:09.995
something that wasn't the crew
drilling over on track 5.

12:21.775 --> 12:27.478
Now, shall we see precisely
what you are and what you do?

12:30.683 --> 12:36.487
And what better way to learn your power
than to conduct an on-site experiment?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.695
Mole men!
Metal ones!

12:44.764 --> 12:48.666
- Actually, Decepticons.
- And they have Arcee and Bumblebee.

12:48.735 --> 12:55.039
- Vogel, this thing have another gear?
- Abso-Freakin'-Lutely!

13:08.220 --> 13:10.254
Hey!
Watch the finish!

13:26.072 --> 13:31.843
Hate to run, but I just missed my train.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.814
Follow the relic.
I'll grab Jack and Miko.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.302
Not good.
Brake line must have been torched.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.369
We can't stop?

13:58.438 --> 14:02.006
No big deal. These tracks go
'round for miles, right, Vogel?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.140
Not this one.

14:18.452 --> 14:21.388
This track dead-ends,
as in crash and burn?

14:21.456 --> 14:24.424
I'm really starting to hate trains!

14:33.704 --> 14:36.605
Whoa!
What was that?

14:46.416 --> 14:47.783
Welcome to Earth!

14:47.852 --> 14:52.788
- Vogel, no!
- She's one of the good guys!

14:53.857 --> 14:55.323
Arcee, the brakes are shot!

14:55.391 --> 14:59.260
Is there any kind of
emergency override?

14:59.329 --> 15:00.294
N-No, ma'am!

15:00.363 --> 15:03.031
But there is a switch-track
control up ahead.

15:03.099 --> 15:06.367
If you can just adjust the pole rod...

15:07.738 --> 15:13.608
You'll know it when you see it.
It'll re-route us to another line.

15:13.676 --> 15:17.545
Did she just turn into...
a motorcycle?

15:27.391 --> 15:32.126
- And that would be?
- Trouble.

15:32.195 --> 15:36.164
Well, well, look who got his
treads back.

16:15.572 --> 16:19.841
- Scrap!
- Uh-Oh!

16:22.012 --> 16:24.345
Whoa! Whoa!

16:36.860 --> 16:38.726
- Yes! Alright.
- Sweet!

16:57.249 --> 16:59.383
Come to mama.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.520
Shock and drop.

18:04.916 --> 18:06.650
Hoo!
We're in the clear.

18:06.719 --> 18:12.489
Still need a way to stop ...
beside slamming into a wall, I mean.

18:14.459 --> 18:17.193
Give me that!

18:33.312 --> 18:36.180
- Watch out!
- Bumblebee!

18:56.635 --> 18:58.468
Bumblebee!

19:00.906 --> 19:01.871
Dude!

19:07.514 --> 19:10.748
How did you not get mashed?

19:12.786 --> 19:13.752
Phase shifter.

19:13.821 --> 19:17.790
Handy when you need to pass through
solid objects. Or vice versa.

19:21.663 --> 19:23.429
No.

19:23.498 --> 19:28.768
No-o-o-o-o!

19:28.837 --> 19:32.905
You scratch my face, I scratch yours!

19:51.260 --> 19:57.532
He knows.
Do we have to take him with us?

19:57.601 --> 20:00.102
To the mother ship?

20:00.171 --> 20:03.906
I think I have a work-around.

20:03.974 --> 20:07.476
That's right, soldier!
Dump that rock and come on home!

20:09.580 --> 20:12.514
Fowler.
Miko, what is it?

20:12.582 --> 20:13.615
What in the sam hill?

20:13.684 --> 20:17.785
I'm in the middle of a crisis
here, and you want me to...

20:17.854 --> 20:23.991
uh...
put him on the line.

20:24.060 --> 20:28.162
<i>Mr. Vogel, this is special agent William
Fowler of the United States government.</i>

20:28.231 --> 20:31.966
<i>You are hereby deputized as an honorary
agent for the department of, um...</i>

20:32.035 --> 20:35.403
<i>interstellar relations.</i>

20:35.472 --> 20:39.975
Thank you, sir.
So... you folks will be in touch?

20:40.044 --> 20:42.011
Abso-Freakin'-Lutely!

20:43.514 --> 20:49.452
But until then, we need to
maintain complete radio silence.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.476
It's been an honor.

20:56.427 --> 21:02.065
- Good call, face.
- Eh, I understand big-city people...

21:02.134 --> 21:04.968
who spend way too much time
below ground.

21:05.037 --> 21:08.372
One relic down, three to go.

21:08.440 --> 21:12.476
Let's hope the others are having
similar results.

21:19.618 --> 21:25.123
Robots who turn into vehicles...

21:26.191 --> 21:28.058
Hmm.
