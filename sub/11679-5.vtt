Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.498
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.572 --> 00:08.063
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.141 --> 00:10.541
[Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.610 --> 00:13.170
no cash, no credit, nojob history..

00:13.246 --> 00:16.373
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.449 --> 00:18.076
Miam i.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.779
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.516
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.590 --> 00:26.457
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.526 --> 00:29.359
an old friend who used to inform on you
to the F.B.I.--

00:29.429 --> 00:31.727
You know spies.
Bunch of bitchy little girls.

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.361
- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.904
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:44.010 --> 00:46.137
[ Chewing]

00:46.212 --> 00:48.646
[ Michael Narrating] One ofthe reasons
surveillance is done in teams...

00:48.715 --> 00:50.649
is that it's exhausting.

00:50.717 --> 00:54.244
Sitting in a car, remaining constantly alert
while you watch a mailbox...

00:54.320 --> 00:56.948
will knock you out
like a handful ofsleeping pills.

00:57.023 --> 01:00.083
Doing it in shifts is the only way
to make sure you don 't miss something.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.287
- Your turn.
- What?

01:03.363 --> 01:05.661
Oh.

Five minutes, your eyeballs are tired.

You should be happy I'm still here.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.307
Fourhoursparkedin a hot car...

01:18.378 --> 01:22.610
'cause this may be the post office box
used by one ofthe people who burnedyou?

01:22.682 --> 01:26.914
Carla's not just one of the people who burned me.
She's all I've got.

01:26.986 --> 01:29.511
Are you sure the manager said today?

01:29.589 --> 01:33.650
He said,
"Mail for this box is picked up everyWednesday."

01:35.195 --> 01:40.064
Did I tell you

[Fiona ]
Ifthat's Carla, that's one hell ofa disguise.

02:06.993 --> 02:10.053
Carla's not the type
to collect her own mail.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.360
[Michael Narrating]
Tailing a trained operative...

02:12.432 --> 02:14.957
requires a number
oftime-consuming preparations--

02:15.034 --> 02:19.471
everything from acquiring a vehicle
they can 't recognize or trace...

02:19.539 --> 02:23.976
to familiarizingyourself
with all the local traffic patterns.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.304
[ Michael]
Go ahead. Turn the car on.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.146
- Turn it on. There you go.
- [ Engi ne Starts ]

02:37.056 --> 02:40.048
[ Michael Narrating ] Ofcourse,
since you can never be sure who's a trained op...

02:40.126 --> 02:42.788

you'll take all those precautions...

02:42.862 --> 02:46.263
just to follow a secretary.
back to her cubicle.

03:01.347 --> 03:05.443

That's Carla's building? No guards, no cameras?

You real ly thi nk Carla

- [ Phone Beeping]
- Hungry?

03:20.700 --> 03:24.568
[ Michael Narrating]
Covert security is designed to blend in--

03:24.637 --> 03:28.095
people you never notice...
untilyou see them in action.

03:28.174 --> 03:32.702
That means you have two choices. You can sit
and wait for an incident to occur...

03:32.779 --> 03:35.805
- oryou can create your own incident.
- [ Cell Phone Rings ]

03:35.882 --> 03:39.249
- Hel lo?
- [ Man ] Yo, bro. Got your grub. I 'm out front.

03:39.319 --> 03:42.914
All right, I 'll come down and meet you
in the lobby, but you can't park there.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.288
- This okay?
- No, man. That's even worse.

03:46.359 --> 03:50.056

Oh, man! You gotta be kiddin'me.

03:50.129 --> 03:53.394
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whereyou goin'?
Go back.

Dude, dude, you arejust asking

03:58.738 --> 04:01.434
You know what, buddy?
I real ly don't have ti me for this.

04:01.507 --> 04:04.135
[ Michael] Hey, sorry., man.
I'm just try.ing to help. You know what?

04:04.210 --> 04:06.804
Just pull around the back, go down the alley.
I'll meetyou there.

04:06.879 --> 04:10.178
- [ Man ] Fi ne. J ust make it quick.
- [ Horn Honks ]

[ Sam ]
Hey, Mikey.

04:28.034 --> 04:32.368
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, look at that.
That looks good. Mmm.

04:32.438 --> 04:36.340
So I pulled the building records
and lease docs for that address you gave me--

04:36.409 --> 04:39.776
Carla's little irrigation consulting company.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.905
- Anything good?
- Mm-hmm.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.347
Office is right there,
second floor, east end.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.715
But it's gonna be tough
getting in there unseen.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.051
Need to find iftheir security has a routine.
Maybe there's a chink in the armor.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.957
Wireless webcam might get whatyou need,
butyou gotta figure out a way to get it in place.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.518
Thinkyou can find a set-up
with a strong enough signal?

04:56.596 --> 04:58.723
I don't know.
Maybe later today, ifl have time.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.666
- Nice watch, Sam.
- Thankyou. It's a Panerai, Ferrari version.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.533
I think they prefer to call 'em
"timepieces."

05:05.605 --> 05:08.972
Anyway, Veronica got us "his and hers"
for our anniversary.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.840
Well, apparently it's been a whole month
since we both said, "I loveyou."

05:11.911 --> 05:16.177
- For that, you get an $8,000 watch?
- And some other things.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.393
- You Michael?
- No.

05:29.462 --> 05:33.159
- 'Cause they said this guy
Michael lives around here.
- Lot of people live around here.

05:33.232 --> 05:35.928
They say he drive a black car too. Dodge.

05:38.404 --> 05:43.103
- Who's they?
- Look, man. I'm not trying to botheryou.
It's just that--

05:43.176 --> 05:46.771
All right, here's the deal.
I-I just got out of prison a couple months ago.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.680
I had a cell mate, said he had a pretty sweet
scam goin' on. Cops couldn't touch him.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.412
This guy Michael comes along,
blows his whole operation up.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.887
That's the kind offriend I need.
Name's Trevor.

05:56.956 --> 05:59.083
You got the wrong guy.

05:59.158 --> 06:01.092
- At least hear my problem.
- Sorry..

06:01.160 --> 06:03.128
Wait, man.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.596

06:05.665 --> 06:07.656
[ Michael ]
Go home.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.503
Please.

06:22.648 --> 06:27.051
- Sixty seconds. Go.
- Okay. All right. Uh--

06:27.120 --> 06:32.615
Okay, I got a reputation in certain circles
as a... expediter of getaway.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.626
- Wheel man.
- I do more than that.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.094
I find the right car,
modify it as necessary...

06:37.163 --> 06:39.358
get rid of it clean,
plus I plan the escape route.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.366
- You're an expediter.
- No, I used to be.

06:41.434 --> 06:44.870
Last time I was in prison, I saw the light.
I decided to turn my life around.

06:44.937 --> 06:48.998
I got my G.E.D. I got certified as a mechanic.
Now I'm tryin' to stay clean no matterwhat.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.771
- Thirty seconds.
- Problem is, I got this boss named Timo.

06:51.844 --> 06:55.109
- He runs this crew
that I used to workwith a few times.
- Pick it up.

06:55.181 --> 06:59.709
They're planning a jewel heist that's going down
during this trade show that's coming up.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.415
- Tell him you can't do it.
- I did. I even offered to find him a replacement.

07:03.489 --> 07:06.925
The thing is, Timo likes toworkwith the same
people he knows, especially during big jobs.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.927
He told me hewould feel
personally betrayed...

07:08.995 --> 07:11.623
- ifl didn't come through with this.
- I'm sure he'll get over it.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.291
You don't know Timo.
That's his way ofsaying do it or die.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.835
- Can you leave town for a while?
- Not withoutviolating my parole.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.838
I gotta stay in the state
for the next five months.

07:19.906 --> 07:22.431
Time's up.
You have two options.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.705
- Go to the police,
tell them everything you just told me.
- Timo will kill my family.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.008
- They have witness protection.
- Yeah, right.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.107
Oryou do thejob, don't get caught.
Eitherway, I can't helpyou.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.119
I got emeralds, man.
These are real.

07:34.187 --> 07:38.521
You can get 1 5 grand easy, and it's clean.
I got a two-carat diamond ring--

07:38.591 --> 07:41.287
Trevor, I heard you out.
Now you need to walk away.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.387
I got a son, man.
He was born while I was locked up.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.735
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I don't wantyou to be sorry.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.863
I just wantyou to understand
where I'm coming from.

07:53.940 --> 07:57.341
I made a promise to myboy
that I was done with that life...

07:57.410 --> 07:59.878
and I ain't breakin' that promise.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.645

Criminal hideouts tend to be pretty nondescript.

08:13.593 --> 08:17.188
Underground caves
andspooky old mansions are dramatic...

08:17.263 --> 08:19.857
but a boathouse on the Keys
is easier to find.

08:19.932 --> 08:23.265
[ Sam ] Well, your boy Trevor-- He 's running
with some pretty impressive company.

08:23.336 --> 08:28.501
I mean, every. name he gave you-- first-round pick
ifyou were draftin 'your own crew.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.838
- What'd he say the job was?
- He didn't.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.378
He knows it's jewels,
but he doesn't know where or when.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.073
This guy Timo
likes to keep details to himself.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.278
- Here we go.

- Well, he rung up three D. U.I. 's
in the last two years...

09:31.837 --> 09:33.737
Only arrested once.

- The only witness was murdered.

09:36.375 --> 09:41.438
- [ Sam ] So you got a plan yet?
- The best way to hel p T revor
is to get the job called off.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.244
- But you don't even know what it is.
- I 'm hoping that won't matter.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.252
- How's that?
- A crew like this runs like a well-oiled machine.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.255

- I know. Any other time, he would've called it off.
- What did he say?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.098
He said he'd been workin' this angle
for the last two years...

12:48.167 --> 12:50.601
and it was too big a score
to let Gilbert ruin it.

12:50.669 --> 12:52.830
He's tryin' to track down
some guy from Georgia.

12:52.905 --> 12:58.434
Here I'm thinkin', ifl do the right thing,
I might catch a break. Whowas I foolin'?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.706
- There's anotherwaywe can get thejob called off.
- How?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.771
Find out the target, tip 'em off.

13:02.848 --> 13:05.612
- Timo's already on edge.
I start asking questions now--
- No, no, no, no.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.245
You stay focused on making Timo
thinkyou're a team player.

13:09.321 --> 13:12.119
- I'll ask the questions.
- Wait, what?

13:12.191 --> 13:17.390
Taking Gilbert out didn't get the job called off,
but it did create a job opening.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.695
Nowyou call Timo. You tell him
thatyou found a safecrackerwho's local.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.667
- Who, you?
- Yeah.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.365

'Cause Timo's not gonna take myword for it.
-Just--Just make the call.

Leave a few cigarette butts
on the ground...

13:44.557 --> 13:49.051

someone was just sneaking a smoke break.

I 'm on the roof across from Carla's bui ldi ng, Sam.
Are you ready?

13:52.464 --> 13:54.398
Give me one second here.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.798
[Michael Narrating]
24-7 surveillance on a location...

13:56.869 --> 13:59.201
used to require
a full team ofoperatives.

13:59.271 --> 14:03.173
These days, you can get by
with a webcam and wireless signal booster...

14:03.242 --> 14:05.540
from your local electronics store.

14:06.779 --> 14:09.543
Ideallyyou'd drill holes
and mount it on brackets...

14:09.615 --> 14:13.676
but when time is an issue,
I prefer dental putty--

14:13.752 --> 14:18.189
easy to mix, easy to apply,
and as strong as cement when it hardens.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.725
- But it hardens quick--
- How's it looki n', Sam?

14:20.793 --> 14:24.194

14:46.385 --> 14:49.013
[ Michael Narrating ]
Makingyourselfinvisible when you need to...

14:49.088 --> 14:51.488
is a crucial skill
for a covert operative.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.491
It sounds exotic,
but it's not like...

14:53.559 --> 14:56.289
there's a super-secret move
they teach you at spy school...

14:56.362 --> 14:58.489
that allows you to vanish
into thin air.

14:58.564 --> 15:03.524

fast feet and strong fingers.

15:07.437 --> 15:11.203
[ Sam ]
Hey, Mi key. H urry up. I got good news.

15:11.274 --> 15:13.333
[ Michael ]
Good news? I could use some good news.

15:13.409 --> 15:16.776
I think I found a gap in the security
at Carla's building.

15:16.846 --> 15:19.974
I'm tellin' you, Mikey, sometimes
I surprise myself. It's beautiful.

15:20.049 --> 15:23.985
I didsome editing on the surveillance tape.
Check this out.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.614
I time-lapsed the footage here just to see
if there's any kind of a routine...

15:27.690 --> 15:30.318
but the maintenance man
and the gardener don't really have one.

15:30.393 --> 15:32.987
They patrol in random intervals,
so the bestyou could do is guess.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.622
- Waitin' for the good part, Sam.
- Comin'.

15:35.698 --> 15:38.826
Okay, about 3:45
night security gets there...

15:38.901 --> 15:42.132
and before they switch over, everyone goes
around back for about five minutes--

15:42.205 --> 15:44.537
I'm guessin'
for some kind of debrief.

15:44.607 --> 15:48.475
During that time,
the only guywatchin' the front...

15:48.544 --> 15:50.478
is the old man at the coffee shop.

down that side alley...

and that is our window.

- The marriage question?
- Yeah, you know it.

- And you said?
- I didn't. That's part ofthe problem.

- She's freakin' out, waiting for an answer.
- So give her one.

25:22.585 --> 25:27.955
Well, I'd love to, Mike,
but there are some issues here.

25:28.023 --> 25:31.117
- Doyou love her?
- [ Exhales ] She could be the one.

- But it's complicated.

You're a true friend, Mikey.

- You finish placin' the cars?
- Yeah. Dropped Timo's car off around the corner.

25:56.118 --> 25:58.143
That the target?

25:58.220 --> 26:00.552
- So now we tip 'em off.
- We have a little snag.

- What?
- See foryourself.

26:03.692 --> 26:08.288
- [Trevor] C.J.?
- Apparently he's obtained gainful employment.

26:08.364 --> 26:13.199
- He's Timo's inside man at thejewelry. exchange.
- Oh, man.

26:13.269 --> 26:18.332
Ifwe're not careful about who we talk to and how,
Timo's gonna know that he has a leak.

26:18.407 --> 26:21.069
His first guess is gonna be me or you.
Either way, it's bad for you.

26:21.143 --> 26:24.476
- [ Trevor] So that's it. I'm screwed.
- No, we're still gonna tip offthe store.

26:24.546 --> 26:27.310
Wejust have to find a way to do it
without C.J. knowing.

Wow.

- Yeah, told him to make the block once
and head down the alley.

"I love you, but I can't marryyou."

There's no such thing, Sam.

It's obvious howmuchyou care forher.

- I'm not sayin' I don't.
- Then why can't you marry her?

27:31.447 --> 27:33.972
Because it's against the law,
all right?

27:34.049 --> 27:36.540
I'm already married...

We both knew the next day it was a big mistake,
but we never got around to gettin' divorced.

- That's not something you "get around to," Sam.
- Look, Fi.

27:47.763 --> 27:52.496
The truth is, I didn't think any ofit mattered
'cause I wasn't the marrying type.

- Until now.
- [ Exhales ]

He wants me at the boathouse.

forviolating parole.

than a promise? He needs his dad.
