WEBVTT

00:01.643 --> 00:03.225
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Trundle.

00:03.226 --> 00:05.233
Without you, the second shrimp platter

00:05.234 --> 00:07.801
would have gone completely to waste.

00:10.572 --> 00:12.007
You know,

00:12.008 --> 00:14.676
having 50 old people say
great things about your dad

00:14.677 --> 00:17.379
is exhausting.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.323
Trying to convince them
you're not the hired help

00:19.324 --> 00:20.379
is no picnic, either.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.985
You didn't complain
when they tipped you.

00:23.986 --> 00:26.287
Money's money.

00:26.288 --> 00:28.289
That Eunice was a hoot.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.593
After we straightened out
the kink in her oxygen tube.

00:31.594 --> 00:35.196
I got asked out by your
dad's 75-year-old cousin.

00:35.197 --> 00:37.032
Of course, he kept calling me Esther

00:37.033 --> 00:39.567
and asking me what heaven was like.

00:39.568 --> 00:41.202
(laughter)

00:41.203 --> 00:43.304
We don't mean to laugh on
such a sad occasion, Oscar.

00:43.305 --> 00:44.372
OSCAR: Oh, no,

00:44.373 --> 00:45.716
he would have wanted us to laugh.

00:45.717 --> 00:46.708
You know how he was.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.743
He was the best.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.345
Yeah, I loved that man.

00:50.346 --> 00:51.646
So, how are you holding up?

00:51.647 --> 00:53.081
Pretty good.

00:53.082 --> 00:54.315
I feel lucky that we

00:54.316 --> 00:57.452
were on good terms after
we reconnected last year.

00:57.453 --> 00:58.920
You're welcome.

00:58.921 --> 01:01.189
And I made sure to call him a lot.

01:01.190 --> 01:03.591
At my insistence.

01:03.592 --> 01:05.193
And said all the things
we needed to say.

01:05.194 --> 01:07.762
Also me.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.930
Felix, keep it up

01:08.931 --> 01:11.665
and you can be the next picture.

01:13.168 --> 01:14.536
Oscar, just remember,

01:14.537 --> 01:15.904
the grieving process can be tricky

01:15.905 --> 01:17.448
and it can take longer than you think.

01:17.449 --> 01:20.817
Yeah, Tuesday mornings
are going to be rough.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.073
That's when Walter and I
had our weekly video chats.

01:24.074 --> 01:25.346
Seriously, Murph?

01:25.347 --> 01:26.481
Yeah.

01:26.482 --> 01:27.949
We got real close last year.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.785
He called it Tuesdays with Murphy.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.553
(crying)

01:35.023 --> 01:37.459
There, there, buddy.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.861
I'm sorry my dad died.

01:39.862 --> 01:43.665
Here, have a sucker.

01:43.666 --> 01:46.067
I love how you put your dad's
candy all over the place.

01:46.068 --> 01:47.535
Well, making candy was his life.

01:47.536 --> 01:49.070
He would have wanted us to enjoy it.

01:49.071 --> 01:51.134
It's like every holiday
rolled into one around here.

01:51.135 --> 01:52.173
(Teddy chuckles)

01:52.174 --> 01:54.943
Oh, and death.

01:54.944 --> 01:56.744
Oscar.

01:56.745 --> 01:59.114
Need I remind you of your
recent trip to the dentist?

01:59.115 --> 02:00.215
And what did she say, hmm?

02:00.216 --> 02:01.649
That you shouldn't be allowed

02:01.650 --> 02:03.084
in the exam room with me?

02:03.085 --> 02:05.286
No, that your tooth was infected

02:05.287 --> 02:06.588
and to avoid sweets.

02:06.589 --> 02:08.732
Luckily, I am here to make
sure you follow her orders.

02:08.733 --> 02:10.191
I believe her first order was,

02:10.192 --> 02:13.261
"Get away from his mouth, Felix,
you're not a dentist."

02:13.262 --> 02:14.392
DANI: Oscar, it's time

02:14.393 --> 02:16.046
for the video conference
with your dad's lawyer.

02:16.047 --> 02:16.854
Guys, why don't we

02:16.855 --> 02:18.488
give him some space and clean up.

02:18.489 --> 02:21.358
(cell phone buzzes)

02:21.359 --> 02:23.693
It's my wife asking when
I'm going to be home.

02:23.694 --> 02:25.662
"Gonna be a while."

02:25.663 --> 02:27.330
"Very emotional day."

02:27.331 --> 02:30.067
Ooh, I got dibs on the mini quiche!

02:30.068 --> 02:31.134
(whispering): Hey!

02:31.135 --> 02:32.602
I'm worried about Oscar.

02:32.603 --> 02:34.471
He's putting on his brave face,
but I can tell

02:34.472 --> 02:36.739
he's avoiding his pain...
both dental and mental.

02:38.008 --> 02:39.443
I think he's coping pretty well.

02:39.444 --> 02:41.378
Yeah, he's holding up
better than I would be.

02:41.379 --> 02:43.780
I cry when my phone dies.

02:43.781 --> 02:46.516
You can't see it,
but as his dearest friend,

02:46.517 --> 02:49.086
I can tell you he is
crying out for help.

02:49.087 --> 02:49.920
I don't know...

02:49.921 --> 02:52.122
OSCAR: Felix, I need you!

02:52.123 --> 02:53.557
Well, well.

02:53.558 --> 02:55.926
What can I do for you,
my fragile friend?

02:55.927 --> 02:58.761
Make the lawyer face happen.

03:00.730 --> 03:01.830
Nope.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.936
(computer program beeps)

03:05.937 --> 03:07.080
LAWYER (on computer): <i>Oscar?</i>

03:07.081 --> 03:08.780
<i>Stanley Barnes.</i>

03:10.173 --> 03:11.508
<i>Nice to meet you,</i>

03:11.509 --> 03:13.710
<i>though I'm sorry about
the circumstances.</i>

03:13.711 --> 03:14.945
<i>I loved your dad.</i>

03:14.946 --> 03:16.012
Oh, thanks.

03:16.013 --> 03:17.681
He was one of a kind.

03:17.682 --> 03:23.286
<i>So let's cut to the chase: your
father was a very wealthy man.</i>

03:23.287 --> 03:25.555
<i>Crazy, crazy wealthy.</i>

03:25.556 --> 03:28.024
What? Are you sure?

03:28.025 --> 03:30.393
<i>Yes, and he's leaving it all to you.</i>

03:30.394 --> 03:32.762
<i>All $300 million and...</i>

03:32.763 --> 03:34.498
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

03:34.499 --> 03:36.332
<i>No, wrong... wrong file.</i>

03:37.467 --> 03:40.137
<i>Ah, here we go.</i>

03:40.138 --> 03:42.472
<i>Your dad had...</i>

03:42.473 --> 03:44.473
<i>next to nothing.</i>

03:46.042 --> 03:48.378
Yeah, that's more like it.

03:48.379 --> 03:52.149
<i>He did have one last request:
that you scatter his ashes</i>

03:52.150 --> 03:55.585
<i>in the river behind
his first candy factory.</i>

03:55.586 --> 03:56.686
I remember that place.

03:56.687 --> 03:58.550
When I was a kid we used
to swim in that river.

03:58.551 --> 04:02.492
Until my eyebrows fell out
and my grades started to drop.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.127
<i>What a touching memory.</i>

04:06.496 --> 04:07.898
<i>So about the ashes...</i>

04:07.899 --> 04:09.699
<i>your dad asked that you scatter them</i>

04:09.700 --> 04:13.136
<i>with someone named Patty Dombrowski.</i>

04:13.137 --> 04:15.172
Really? His old business partner?

04:15.173 --> 04:16.505
They haven't spoken in 30 years.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.209
Ooh, mysterious.

04:19.209 --> 04:20.810
What happened?

04:20.810 --> 04:23.914
I don't know, but Patty's name
was forbidden around our house.

04:23.915 --> 04:27.249
We had to call our favorite
mints "peppermint betrayals."

04:29.085 --> 04:30.687
<i>I'll email you Patty's address.</i>

04:30.688 --> 04:33.256
<i>Again, sorry for your loss.</i>

04:33.257 --> 04:35.658
<i>But congratulations
on the $300 million.</i>

04:37.127 --> 04:39.196
<i>Oh boy, I did it again.</i>

04:39.197 --> 04:41.965
Well, guess I'll have to find
Patty and take care of this.

04:41.966 --> 04:43.133
Maybe next week.

04:43.134 --> 04:45.168
No... Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.469
You can't put this off.

04:46.470 --> 04:48.638
You need this closure as part
of the healing process.

04:48.639 --> 04:50.173
I have closure.

04:50.174 --> 04:52.207
I'm moving on to the candy
part of the process.

04:53.910 --> 04:55.311
Fine.

04:56.479 --> 04:58.299
I'm going to need you
to empty your pockets.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.018
And your jacket.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.294
And the candy corn in your underpants.

05:11.295 --> 05:12.328
Damn it!

05:34.150 --> 05:37.553
Okay, Pop, one last road trip.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.659
Oh no.

05:42.660 --> 05:43.793
First mate Felix Unger

05:43.794 --> 05:45.929
requesting permission to support.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.431
What are you talking about, man?

05:48.432 --> 05:51.268
I thought I would come along
and help you with your tooth.

05:51.269 --> 05:53.570
And any other pain you
might be experiencing.

05:53.571 --> 05:55.092
Felix, you don't have to come with me.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.059
I'll be fine on my own.

05:56.060 --> 05:57.073
Nonsense.

05:57.074 --> 05:58.289
I brought along the antibiotics,

05:58.289 --> 06:00.477
which to no one's surprise
you left on our kitchen table.

06:00.478 --> 06:01.645
And plenty of lukewarm water

06:01.646 --> 06:03.079
for your temperature-sensitive tooth.

06:03.080 --> 06:03.961
Felix, I don't want...

06:03.962 --> 06:05.225
And a six-pack of pudding cups.

06:05.226 --> 06:06.811
We should get in.

06:08.018 --> 06:10.620
Oscar...

06:10.621 --> 06:12.389
You will not regret this.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.225
Two friends on the open
road, one hurting,

06:15.226 --> 06:17.327
one helping to heal the hurt.

06:17.328 --> 06:19.596
One wanting to hurt the healer.

06:19.597 --> 06:21.698
Okay, well, that just
sounds like a cry for help.

06:21.699 --> 06:23.442
You know, in Mexico,
they celebrate the dead

06:23.443 --> 06:24.834
with <i>DIA de los Muertos...</i>

06:24.835 --> 06:25.669
What are you doing?

06:25.670 --> 06:27.537
Oh, Dad's riding shotgun.

06:27.538 --> 06:28.837
He talks less.

06:38.313 --> 06:39.647
Did you really have to ask him

06:39.648 --> 06:42.082
all those questions about his family?

06:42.083 --> 06:44.117
Toll booth operators are people, too.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.790
Hi.

06:49.791 --> 06:51.692
Does a Patty Dombrowski live here?

06:51.693 --> 06:53.526
Well, she used to.

06:56.163 --> 06:58.632
I'm her mother, Mrs. Dombrowski.

06:58.633 --> 07:01.068
You can call me Mrs. D.

07:01.069 --> 07:03.493
I'm Oscar Madison.

07:03.494 --> 07:04.694
Oh,

07:04.695 --> 07:06.696
I'm so sorry about your dad.

07:06.697 --> 07:08.465
Such a lovely man.

07:08.466 --> 07:12.469
He and Patty used to test
their candy recipes right here.

07:12.470 --> 07:14.204
They always

07:14.205 --> 07:18.340
created the sweetest-smelling
kitchen fires.

07:20.177 --> 07:21.378
Please sit down.

07:21.379 --> 07:22.811
Oh, thank you.

07:24.448 --> 07:25.415
I'm Felix Unger.

07:25.416 --> 07:27.250
The pleasure is mine.

07:27.251 --> 07:28.919
Ooh, a charmer.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.587
I like him.

07:30.588 --> 07:32.254
You wanna keep him?

07:33.590 --> 07:35.612
So your daughter and
Walter worked together

07:35.613 --> 07:36.420
out of your kitchen,

07:36.421 --> 07:38.195
the sweet aroma of sugar mingling

07:38.196 --> 07:41.965
harmoniously with a generous
scoop of entrepreneurship.

07:41.966 --> 07:45.034
Okay, he's beginning to annoy me.

07:47.137 --> 07:48.939
So, Mrs. D, if you
don't mind my asking,

07:48.940 --> 07:50.807
why'd Walter and Patty stop speaking?

07:50.808 --> 07:52.309
Well, you'd have to ask Patty.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.977
I'm sure she would love

07:53.978 --> 07:55.645
to see you, Oscar.

07:55.646 --> 07:58.148
I'll write down her address.

07:58.149 --> 07:59.583
Oh, thank you very much.

07:59.584 --> 08:01.618
Now, Oscar, let's take
a quick water break.

08:01.619 --> 08:03.019
Remember what the dentist said:

08:03.020 --> 08:04.588
more hydration makes inflammation

08:04.589 --> 08:06.723
take a long vacation.

08:06.724 --> 08:07.858
She didn't say that.

08:07.859 --> 08:09.993
She easily could have.

08:09.994 --> 08:11.661
Is he always like this?

08:11.662 --> 08:13.029
Oh...

08:13.030 --> 08:15.231
You have no idea.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.768
So, how are you holding up?

08:18.769 --> 08:20.370
Tooth-wise and... otherwise.

08:20.371 --> 08:22.539
Would you stop asking me that?

08:22.540 --> 08:24.274
I'm getting tired of
hearing your voice.

08:24.275 --> 08:25.738
VOICE of FELIX: <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.</i>

08:25.739 --> 08:26.776
How'd you do that?

08:26.777 --> 08:29.579
- <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar...</i>
- How are you doing that?

08:29.580 --> 08:31.181
It's your mobile device.

08:31.182 --> 08:33.383
What the hell?

08:33.384 --> 08:35.818
It's an alarm I made to remind
you to take your medication.

08:35.820 --> 08:38.124
I took your phone and recorded
it while you were sleeping.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.023
How did you get the password?

08:40.024 --> 08:42.958
I took a shot with 1-2-3-4,
and what do you know?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.462
Well, I'm going to change it now.

08:45.463 --> 08:47.631
To 5-6-7-8?

08:47.632 --> 08:48.832
Damn it!

08:48.833 --> 08:50.267
I'm not taking that pill.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.334
That's okay, I understand.

08:51.335 --> 08:52.502
I understand completely.

08:52.503 --> 08:54.538
I would not force you to do something

08:54.539 --> 08:56.106
that I would not do my...

08:56.107 --> 08:58.208
Oh, look,
how about just a snack though?

08:58.209 --> 09:00.342
Hey! Peanut butter on a cracker!

09:02.746 --> 09:05.415
Wait, is there a pill in here?

09:05.416 --> 09:06.516
(shushing)

09:06.517 --> 09:08.285
Swallow.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.719
Who's a good boy?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.387
I am. I'm a good boy.

09:13.690 --> 09:17.127
Can I help you?

09:17.128 --> 09:18.428
Yes.

09:18.429 --> 09:19.972
We're looking for someone named Patty.

09:19.973 --> 09:21.598
Oh, Patty's my sister,

09:21.599 --> 09:22.966
but she's not here right now.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.434
Ah...

09:24.435 --> 09:26.436
Has she gotten herself
into another one of those

09:26.437 --> 09:29.204
three-way-affair thingies?

09:31.441 --> 09:34.611
No. This is Oscar Madison,
Walter's son.

09:34.612 --> 09:35.879
Oscar?!

09:35.880 --> 09:39.115
Oh, Oscar, Oscar.

09:39.116 --> 09:41.851
Oh, your dad was the sweetest guy.

09:41.852 --> 09:44.854
He gave me my first job...
babysitting you.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.389
Wait a minute, Viv?

09:46.390 --> 09:47.958
- Mmm-hmm. Yes!
- Of course.

09:47.959 --> 09:49.659
Babysitting for Oscar.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.161
I would ask what that was like,

09:51.162 --> 09:52.696
but I have a pretty good idea.

09:52.697 --> 09:56.700
He used to do the cutest little
dance when he had to pee.

09:56.701 --> 09:58.335
We called it

09:58.336 --> 10:00.170
his pee-pee dance, didn't we?

10:00.171 --> 10:03.173
Oh, I don't think we have time to...

10:03.174 --> 10:04.975
Please, Viv, tell me more.

10:04.976 --> 10:07.177
He would eat anything that
wasn't nailed down:

10:07.178 --> 10:10.479
orange peels, dirt,
handfuls of the dog's fur.

10:11.514 --> 10:13.650
But I was adorable, right?

10:13.651 --> 10:15.250
Not what I'm saying at all.

10:16.519 --> 10:21.691
You were less like a child and
more like a young, chubby goat.

10:21.692 --> 10:23.226
(laughs)

10:23.227 --> 10:24.861
I like you, Viv.

10:24.862 --> 10:26.830
If you want to talk to Patty,

10:26.831 --> 10:29.699
she usually spends Saturday
afternoons hanging out

10:29.700 --> 10:31.201
at McConnell's bar on 5th.

10:31.202 --> 10:32.769
Thank you.

10:32.770 --> 10:33.770
Shall we, Oscar?

10:33.771 --> 10:36.273
Oh, pee-pee dance!

10:36.274 --> 10:37.974
He's been forcing me
to hydrate all day.

10:37.975 --> 10:38.759
Do you have a...

10:38.760 --> 10:40.304
- Yeah, yeah.
- Is there a way I can...

10:40.305 --> 10:41.879
Is there a room that I could...

10:41.879 --> 10:43.780
Right that way, yes.

10:43.781 --> 10:46.382
Oh, keep your hands off the dog!

10:51.988 --> 10:53.290
She's not here.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.270
Let's just go home.

10:54.271 --> 10:55.454
I'll do this some other time.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.526
Oscar.

10:56.527 --> 10:58.761
What? Like my dad's in a rush?

11:00.030 --> 11:02.399
Stop avoiding... you're doing this.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.866
Bartendress!

11:05.001 --> 11:06.168
Hey.

11:08.805 --> 11:11.574
So, can I get you boys
a couple of ice cold beers?

11:11.575 --> 11:13.910
- Hell yeah!
- Absolutely not!

11:13.911 --> 11:15.412
Oscar, no.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.116
No alcohol while you're
on the antibiotics.

11:17.117 --> 11:18.581
I need something to dull the pain.

11:18.582 --> 11:20.483
Of you.

11:20.484 --> 11:23.620
I have plenty of fluids
here in my Manny sack.

11:23.621 --> 11:27.157
Wow, an even creepier way
of saying fanny pack.

11:27.158 --> 11:28.837
Oscar, that is not a good idea.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.421
Okay, how is that
cold sensitivity going

11:30.422 --> 11:31.328
right about now, huh?

11:31.329 --> 11:32.761
(high pitched): Not a problem.

11:34.230 --> 11:36.833
Miss, do you know a Patty Dombrowski?

11:36.834 --> 11:39.102
Oh, yeah, she just left
here a little while ago.

11:39.103 --> 11:40.470
Why, who's asking?

11:40.471 --> 11:41.771
I'm Felix.

11:41.772 --> 11:43.395
This is my adult roommate,
Oscar Madison.

11:43.396 --> 11:44.441
He's Walter's son.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.910
No way!

11:46.911 --> 11:49.512
Grubby little Oscar Madison?

11:49.513 --> 11:51.748
Yeah.

11:51.749 --> 11:53.183
Oh, my God!

11:53.184 --> 11:56.186
Your dad used to bring you
here when you were little.

11:56.187 --> 12:00.757
One time you ate a whole
package of urinal cakes.

12:00.758 --> 12:03.293
It said cake.

12:03.294 --> 12:05.195
You were always eating.

12:05.196 --> 12:06.219
You were like a little...

12:06.220 --> 12:08.264
- Goat.
- Goat.

12:08.265 --> 12:10.400
I loved Walter.

12:10.401 --> 12:12.802
He had the greatest stories.

12:12.803 --> 12:14.304
He really kept this place laughing.

12:14.305 --> 12:17.105
You guys talking about Walter?

12:19.442 --> 12:22.212
We used to work at the candy factory.

12:22.213 --> 12:24.447
Back in the day.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.883
Walter was the best boss.

12:26.884 --> 12:28.752
Oh, yes, some of our happiest days

12:28.753 --> 12:31.020
were working for that guy.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.823
Before he and Patty
stopped working together.

12:33.824 --> 12:35.892
Do you know what their fight was about?

12:35.893 --> 12:37.560
No, but it got ugly.

12:37.561 --> 12:40.330
I heard he tried to strangle
her with some licorice rope.

12:40.331 --> 12:41.965
I heard

12:41.966 --> 12:44.167
that she licked a candy
cane into a sharp point

12:44.168 --> 12:45.667
and stabbed him.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.972
Then he gave her a chocolate
egg filled with cyanide.

12:51.241 --> 12:53.575
Now I'm just making stuff up.

12:54.577 --> 12:56.846
So, do you guys know where Patty is?

12:56.847 --> 12:58.114
FRED: Gee, I don't know.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.583
But maybe if you were to
buy us a beer, we could...

13:00.584 --> 13:01.651
She's at the factory.

13:01.652 --> 13:03.453
Dude!

13:03.454 --> 13:05.655
We were this close
to getting free beers.

13:05.656 --> 13:07.523
I didn't say candy factory.

13:08.491 --> 13:10.727
So the candy factory is still open?

13:10.728 --> 13:12.662
After your dad left,
Patty kept it going.

13:12.663 --> 13:14.097
Okay, let's go.

13:14.098 --> 13:15.698
VOICE OF FELIX: <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.</i>

13:15.699 --> 13:17.667
Are you kidding me?

13:17.668 --> 13:19.302
Pill time!

13:19.303 --> 13:20.970
You are driving me
crazy with this thing!

13:20.971 --> 13:22.434
VOICE OF FELIX: <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.</i>

13:22.435 --> 13:23.373
How do you turn it off?

13:23.374 --> 13:25.475
Take your pill and I will tell you.

13:25.476 --> 13:27.676
VOICE OF FELIX: <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.</i>

13:29.879 --> 13:32.314
- You just broke your phone.
- Totally worth it.

13:39.289 --> 13:42.891
Hi, we're looking for
a Patty Dombrowski.

13:48.465 --> 13:50.366
If you're from the health department,

13:50.367 --> 13:53.101
my hair net's over there.

14:04.556 --> 14:06.558
I can't believe your dad's gone.

14:06.559 --> 14:08.460
Sorry for your loss.

14:08.461 --> 14:09.728
Thank you.

14:09.729 --> 14:10.928
He's in there?

14:14.266 --> 14:15.267
Yes.

14:15.268 --> 14:16.735
Hey, Walter.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.170
Been a while.

14:18.171 --> 14:20.471
You look a little ashen.

14:22.174 --> 14:24.176
He always liked a good joke.

14:24.177 --> 14:25.677
He sure did.

14:25.678 --> 14:27.879
You know, I used to come
around this place a lot

14:27.880 --> 14:29.047
when I was a kid.

14:29.048 --> 14:32.049
Yeah, there's not a machine
in here that you didn't lick.

14:32.918 --> 14:35.654
Including the forklift.

14:35.655 --> 14:38.423
It said fork.

14:38.424 --> 14:40.558
It didn't say lick!

14:42.994 --> 14:47.766
Thank God the government wasn't
big on health codes back then.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.134
Back then?

14:49.135 --> 14:52.737
In 1980?

14:52.738 --> 14:54.439
Okay.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.241
So anyway, Mrs. Dombrowski...

14:56.242 --> 14:57.709
You're a middle-aged man.

14:57.710 --> 14:58.777
Call me Patty.

14:58.778 --> 15:00.278
Okay, Patty.

15:00.279 --> 15:01.780
Well, in my dad's will,

15:01.781 --> 15:05.484
he wanted you and I to get
together to scatter his ashes.

15:05.485 --> 15:07.419
Really?

15:07.420 --> 15:08.887
That's odd.

15:08.888 --> 15:11.490
The way things ended
with me and your dad,

15:11.491 --> 15:13.357
I didn't think he'd
want me part of this.

15:14.226 --> 15:15.126
Want a taffy?

15:15.127 --> 15:16.860
Yeah.

15:18.430 --> 15:20.565
Actually, Oscar will have to decline.

15:20.566 --> 15:22.133
He's having tooth problems.

15:22.134 --> 15:23.168
PATTY: Who is this guy,

15:23.169 --> 15:25.303
your butler?

15:25.304 --> 15:27.439
He's a pain in my butler.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.341
Oscar isn't minding his health.

15:29.342 --> 15:31.576
Well, you are not minding
your own business.

15:31.577 --> 15:33.245
Well, you are acting like a child.

15:33.246 --> 15:36.481
You heard the lady,
I'm a middle-aged man!

15:36.482 --> 15:38.049
VOICE OF FELIX: <i>Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.</i>

15:38.050 --> 15:40.952
Oh, you cannot be serious!

15:40.953 --> 15:43.056
That's right, I knew that
you would disable the alarm

15:43.057 --> 15:44.923
on your phone,
so I put a backup on mine.

15:44.924 --> 15:46.958
I should never have let
you come on this trip.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.226
Now give me your phone!

15:48.227 --> 15:49.530
No, when you take your medicine.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.600
- Give me your phone!
- When you take medicine!

15:55.016 --> 15:55.733
Oh dear.

15:57.769 --> 16:00.904
Oh dear? That's $200 worth of taffy!

16:02.807 --> 16:04.242
And, you know...

16:04.243 --> 16:06.011
my dad.

16:06.012 --> 16:08.379
What do we do now?

16:09.814 --> 16:12.350
Well, this isn't weird at all.

16:12.351 --> 16:16.220
Just a night at the river
with a giant vat of ash taffy.

16:17.222 --> 16:19.424
What flavor was it anyway?

16:19.425 --> 16:21.927
Well, it was watermelon.

16:21.928 --> 16:24.328
I guess now it's Waltermelon.

16:26.464 --> 16:27.866
Okay, let's do this.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.367
(clears throat)

16:29.368 --> 16:31.303
So long, Walter.

16:31.304 --> 16:33.438
Thanks for all the good times.

16:33.439 --> 16:35.239
Godspeed, Mr. Madison.

16:37.242 --> 16:39.144
I don't know what to say.

16:39.145 --> 16:41.313
This is really hard.

16:41.314 --> 16:42.314
Oscar, it's okay.

16:42.315 --> 16:43.647
Take your time.

16:44.849 --> 16:49.186
Dad, I'm really gonna miss you.

16:50.455 --> 16:52.891
I hope that wherever you are,

16:52.892 --> 16:55.727
the New York Mets are on

16:55.728 --> 16:58.796
and it's always the '86 World Series.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.702
I loved being your son.

17:03.703 --> 17:05.636
I still do.

17:07.005 --> 17:09.507
Okay.

17:09.508 --> 17:11.775
Bye, Dad.

17:22.287 --> 17:25.489
Well, I guess we're going
to be here for a while.

17:27.192 --> 17:31.529
While we're waiting for
my dad to splash down,

17:31.530 --> 17:34.633
do you mind if I ask what the
fight you two had was about?

17:34.634 --> 17:39.004
Well, back in the mid-'80s, we
invented a new flavor of taffy.

17:39.005 --> 17:41.740
He wanted to call it Ocean Breeze.

17:41.741 --> 17:43.375
I hated that name.

17:43.376 --> 17:44.776
What name did you prefer?

17:44.777 --> 17:46.277
Tropical Wind.

17:46.278 --> 17:47.812
I mean, the choice was clear.

17:47.813 --> 17:51.650
- Ocean Breeze.
- Tropical Wind.

17:51.651 --> 17:53.918
We used to fight about
all kinds of things,

17:53.919 --> 17:57.322
but for some reason we
never got over this one.

17:57.323 --> 17:58.523
What happened?

17:58.524 --> 17:59.758
We yelled.

17:59.759 --> 18:01.292
Then we stopped yelling.

18:01.293 --> 18:02.560
Then we stopped talking.

18:02.561 --> 18:04.763
Next thing you know

18:04.764 --> 18:05.997
it's 30 years later

18:05.998 --> 18:08.500
and his son shows up
with his life partner

18:08.501 --> 18:10.635
to tell me he's gone.

18:10.636 --> 18:14.606
- Oh, we're not...
- Let it go.

18:14.607 --> 18:16.574
I wish I hadn't been so stubborn.

18:16.575 --> 18:18.877
Well, maybe Dad sending me here

18:18.878 --> 18:21.378
was his way of saying the same thing.

18:23.181 --> 18:24.849
Well, I'll let you finish up.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.518
Enjoy the ocean breeze, Walter.

18:30.188 --> 18:32.323
You were right, Felix.

18:32.324 --> 18:35.527
This was a much harder trip
than I thought.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.595
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

18:37.596 --> 18:39.297
I'm sorry I got overbearing.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.066
It's what I do when...

18:41.067 --> 18:43.134
Well, it's what I do.

18:43.135 --> 18:45.870
Well, I'm glad you do it.

18:45.871 --> 18:47.539
Thanks for coming.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.607
Hey, let's make sure

18:49.608 --> 18:51.376
we don't end up like
Patty and Walter, okay?

18:51.377 --> 18:54.713
That's just what I was thinking, buddy.

18:54.714 --> 18:56.948
Oh, look, hey, he's picking up steam.

18:56.949 --> 18:58.683
Come on, Dad!

18:58.684 --> 18:59.951
Keep oozing!

18:59.952 --> 19:01.652
Keep oozing!

19:04.122 --> 19:06.458
(taffy splashes)

19:06.459 --> 19:07.592
Huh.

19:07.593 --> 19:10.128
Taffy floats.

19:10.129 --> 19:12.192
Your father is going to make
that family of seagulls

19:12.193 --> 19:13.792
very happy.

19:14.966 --> 19:16.234
Oscar,

19:16.235 --> 19:17.258
is that a police officer?

19:17.259 --> 19:18.737
I think so.

19:18.738 --> 19:20.105
Should we flee the scene?

19:20.106 --> 19:24.209
Well, considering we are dumping
a body, yeah, we should.

19:24.210 --> 19:25.209
Flee the scene!

19:35.006 --> 19:35.974
BOTH: Ah!

19:35.975 --> 19:37.174
ALL: Ah!

19:39.044 --> 19:42.013
I didn't eat a whole pie!

19:42.014 --> 19:44.916
All right, fine, I ate a whole pie.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.985
What are you guys doing here?

19:46.986 --> 19:50.121
It totally wasn't because we
started eating the leftovers

19:50.122 --> 19:52.591
and then passed out.

19:52.592 --> 19:56.995
No, we wanted to be here
for you when you got back,

19:56.996 --> 19:59.197
so you would know that
we're here for you.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.235
And now you're back, and we're here.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.004
For you.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.507
Sorry, I polished off
all the leftover wine.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.242
She tried to kiss two of us.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.547
No, no, no, no, no.

20:18.683 --> 20:20.485
So, how'd it go? Did you find Patty?

20:20.486 --> 20:22.153
Yeah, it was a good day.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.388
FELIX: Yes, it was.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.723
A lot of healing.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.359
Speaking of which,
it is time for your medicine.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.561
Oh, buddy, can you give
me a break from the pills

20:29.562 --> 20:30.861
for a while?

20:31.763 --> 20:33.732
Yeah. You had a pretty big day.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.836
You know what, why don't you
just have this nice pie?

20:35.837 --> 20:37.135
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.335
Thanks.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.908
Mmm, that's really good.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.342
You put a pill in it?

20:44.343 --> 20:45.976
I did.

20:48.446 --> 20:49.613
(shushes)

20:54.119 --> 20:56.420
- I'm a good boy.
- Okay.
