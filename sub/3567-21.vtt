00:28.332 --> 00:32.256
Hey, Steven! Do you
want to try some special,

00:32.325 --> 00:35.427
- new french fries?
- Do I?!

00:39.432 --> 00:43.504
- Hooooot!
- They're "special"

00:43.539 --> 00:47.709
because they're seasoned with fire salt!

00:53.441 --> 00:56.342
Steven, what are you ...
Ow!

00:56.377 --> 00:57.883
Sowwy, Lars.

00:57.951 --> 01:01.954
Ugh. Steven, who do you think
has to clean up this mess?

01:02.021 --> 01:05.263
- Sadie, clean up this mess.
- No way! It's your turn!

01:05.265 --> 01:08.812
- I cleaned the last five Stevens!
- Aw, come on!

01:08.847 --> 01:12.531
That fall messed up my back!
It hurts really bad.

01:12.599 --> 01:16.902
Fine. Move aside. I'll take care of this.
Can you grab the soap?

01:16.970 --> 01:19.482
Ohh! It hurts so much!

01:19.483 --> 01:23.592
Maybe you should take the day off.

01:23.676 --> 01:27.399
- Okay! You gonna be fine on your own?
- Well, I guess so, but...

01:27.400 --> 01:31.077
- You're the best, player 2!
- Aww.

01:31.112 --> 01:36.063
- Uh, I can't run this place by myself!
- I could help!

01:36.098 --> 01:39.324
This place has given me
so many delicious donuts.

01:39.392 --> 01:43.873
- It's time I gave back.
- I hereby deputize you as "Lars for the day."

01:43.908 --> 01:49.451
- Now, it's time I showed you the employee room.
- Whoa.

01:49.536 --> 01:52.137
This is the most magical
place I've ever seen!

01:52.138 --> 01:55.461
Let me give you the tour.
These are the extra supplies,

01:55.462 --> 01:58.844
cups, plastic silverware.
Sometimes I sleep on the napkins

01:58.878 --> 02:03.715
- when I get tired.
- Is that why they're called nap-kins?

02:03.800 --> 02:06.682
Not really, no. Good joke, though.

02:06.683 --> 02:10.110
On breaks, we chill out
here. We can even watch tv!

02:10.112 --> 02:14.748
Sometimes, Lars will cover for
me so I can watch "canine court."

02:14.749 --> 02:18.814
And now, most important of
all, this is where we store the donuts.

02:18.898 --> 02:22.673
They're mailed in from some
corporate bake-station.

02:22.708 --> 02:27.605
- You mean you don't make them here?
- No, not since... the accident.

02:27.640 --> 02:31.243
Now, Steven, this job is a big
responsibility, so you're gonna

02:31.327 --> 02:35.565
- have to watch this videotape.
- What is it?

02:35.600 --> 02:38.501
It's like a dvd shaped

04:27.131 --> 04:31.179

- We can't "fire Lars."

There was this one time ... the new
"army of war" game was coming out.

05:00.910 --> 05:04.879
But Lars was banned from the
only place selling it.

05:04.914 --> 05:06.709
He wanted it so bad!

05:06.710 --> 05:10.301
So who does he beg to stand
in line for seven hours?

05:10.386 --> 05:13.008
Me!
I didn't think much of it.

05:13.009 --> 05:16.112
When I got to his house, I
saw he cleaned up his room

05:16.113 --> 05:18.927
a little, and he got a
big box of oyster crackers.

05:18.978 --> 05:20.841
They're my favorite.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.764
He let me be his "player 2," and

05:22.815 --> 05:28.153
- we spent the whole night together.
- That really is nice.

05:28.237 --> 05:32.907
- Must've been one great video game!
- Yeah, it was.

anything to the donuts!

- Hi, Lars!

07:39.368 --> 07:42.870
- Why is Steven in a donut suit?
- Don't worry about that.

07:42.938 --> 07:46.040
- How's your back?
- Uh, actually, it still hurts like ...

07:46.108 --> 07:49.644
- Really.
- No, no, it's cool. I know I can

07:49.712 --> 07:54.432
- count on you to help, "P" 2.
- Sure. Just relax. In fact...

07:54.467 --> 07:58.219
- Why don't you have a donut?
- Yeah, all right.

07:58.287 --> 08:04.058
Careful. It's a little hot.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.094
Hey, this is pretty good.

08:06.095 --> 08:08.947
This a new flavor or something?

08:09.031 --> 08:14.073

- Uh, Lars, drink this!

08:28.614 --> 08:30.251
No! Lars, come back!
