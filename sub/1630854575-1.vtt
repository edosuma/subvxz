WEBVTT

00:07.916 --> 00:09.875
[man] Okay, roll film.

00:09.958 --> 00:12.250
[machine powering up, whirring]

00:26.500 --> 00:30.000
Don't think of a car crash in a movie
as a violent act.

00:30.083 --> 00:33.416
No, these collisions
are part of a long tradition

00:33.500 --> 00:35.375
of American optimism.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.083
A reaffirmation
of traditional values and beliefs.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.125
A celebration.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.000
Think of these crashes
like you would Thanksgiving

00:43.083 --> 00:44.875
and the Fourth of July.

00:44.958 --> 00:48.458
On these days, we don't mourn the dead
or rejoice in miracles.

00:48.541 --> 00:52.041
No, these are days of secular optimism.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.833
Of self-celebration.

00:54.666 --> 00:57.625
Each crash is meant to be
better than the last.

00:57.708 --> 01:02.750
There's a constant upgrading
of tools, skills, a meeting of challenges.

01:04.458 --> 01:08.333
An American film director says,
"I want this flatbed truck

01:08.416 --> 01:12.458
to do a double mid-air somersault
that produces an orange ball of fire

01:12.541 --> 01:15.125
in a 36-foot diameter."

01:15.208 --> 01:19.000
The movie breaks away
from complicated human passions

01:19.083 --> 01:24.625
to show us something elemental,
something loud and fiery and head-on.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.125
Watch any car crash in any American movie.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.708
It is a high-spirited moment,

01:29.791 --> 01:32.583
like old-fashioned stunt flying

01:32.666 --> 01:34.875
or walking on wings.

01:34.958 --> 01:36.750
The people who stage these crashes

01:36.833 --> 01:40.958
are able to capture
a light-heartedness, a carefree enjoyment

01:41.041 --> 01:44.375
that car crashes in foreign movies
can never approach.

01:44.458 --> 01:48.000
You might say, "But what about
all that blood and glass?"

01:48.083 --> 01:50.291
"The screeching rubber,
the crushed bodies,

01:50.375 --> 01:53.208
the severed limbs?"
"What kind of optimism is this?"

01:54.166 --> 01:56.208
Look past the violence, I say.

01:57.041 --> 02:01.250
There is a wonderful brimming spirit
of innocence and fun.

02:20.916 --> 02:24.166
[female volunteer] Welcome, freshmen!
Any questions, ask me.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.541
Welcome. Come on, freshmen.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.041
Hey, you guys! Welcome!

02:29.125 --> 02:31.541
- We've got to go. We're double-parked.
- Do not rush me.

02:31.625 --> 02:33.541
[father 1] Traffic is bad right now.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.541
You're not planning on helping me move in?
I got all this stuff.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.375
- [father 2] Hey, buddy!
- We've got this.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.000
I can't believe that you said <i>that</i>
to my roommate.

02:41.666 --> 02:44.833
You don't even know him.
Don't tell him my own business.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.541
You've tied this three times already.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.583
- It's the same every time.
- I didn't like the way it looked.

02:50.416 --> 02:51.375
[car horn honks]

03:00.958 --> 03:03.750
[man] <i>Let's enjoy these aimless days</i>
<i>while we can.</i>

03:08.416 --> 03:10.458
- You should have been there.
- Where?

03:10.541 --> 03:12.791
[man] It's the day of the station wagons.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.958
Did I miss it again?
You're supposed to remind me.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.708
[man] It was a brilliant event.

03:17.791 --> 03:20.583
They stretched all the way
past the music library

03:20.666 --> 03:21.916
and onto the interstate.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.916
You know I need reminding, Jack.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.250
- They'll be back next year.
- I hope so.

03:26.333 --> 03:31.250
I realized it was 1968
I started the Hitler Studies program.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.666
I've witnessed this event now
for 16 years.

03:34.750 --> 03:38.458
I don't care about the station wagons.
I wanted to see the people.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.000
What are they like this year?

03:40.083 --> 03:43.250
The women wear plaid skirts
and cable-knit sweaters.

03:43.333 --> 03:46.375
I knew it.
And the men are in hacking jackets.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.500
What is a hacking jacket?

03:48.583 --> 03:50.708
They've grown comfortable
with their money.

03:50.791 --> 03:54.083
They believe that they're entitled to it.
They glow a little.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.750
I have trouble imagining death
at that income level.

03:56.833 --> 04:00.541
Maybe there's no death as we know it,
just documents changing hands.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.625
- How do astronauts float?
- They're lighter than air.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.250
There is no air. They can't be lighter
than something that isn't there.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.291
- Not that we don't have a station wagon.
- It's small and maroon.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.833
- I thought space was cold.
- [Jack] It has a rusted door.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.041
- Space?
- Our station wagon.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.500
It's called the sun's corolla.
We saw it on the Weather Network.

04:16.583 --> 04:19.041
- I thought Corolla was a car.
- Everything's a car.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.166
Where's Wilder?

04:20.250 --> 04:21.500
- Wilder?
- [Jack groans]

04:21.583 --> 04:25.166
- Wilder, are you hungry?
- [girl 1] How cold is space?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.958
You still playing the fellow in prison?

04:27.041 --> 04:29.000
- I think I've got him cornered.
- Who did he kill?

04:29.083 --> 04:30.958
- He was under pressure.
- How many did he shoot?

04:31.041 --> 04:32.416
- Five.
- Five people?

04:32.500 --> 04:34.750
Not counting the state trooper
which was later.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.958
This is not the lunch
I planned for myself.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.250
I was thinking yoghurt and wheat germ.

04:39.333 --> 04:42.083
- Where have we heard that before?
- [girl 1] Probably right here.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.000
You keep buying stuff you never eat.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.041
Steffie, Capricorn…

04:45.125 --> 04:47.708
Babette thinks if she keeps buying it,
she'll have to eat it.

04:47.791 --> 04:49.166
We love her habits.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.666
If anybody here has to show discipline
in matters of diet, it's me.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.666
…in your favor into profitable enterprise.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.333
- [girl 2] What's beeping?
- Smoke alarm.

04:56.416 --> 04:58.708
- Is there a fire?
- That or the battery's dead.

04:58.791 --> 05:01.083
Jack, Virgo,
you've been swimming against the tide…

05:01.166 --> 05:03.541
Most fires in buildings start
because of faulty wiring.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.541
Phrase you can't hang around
without hearing.

05:05.625 --> 05:08.208
- You'll add to your possessions.
- I'll replace them.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.583
He tries not to listen
although he secretly wants to.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.458
It's like love slash hate.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.000
Did he know who he was killing
or were they strangers?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.875
- [boy] Total strangers.
- Was he hearing voices?

05:17.958 --> 05:19.958
- [boy] On TV, yeah.
- What did they say?

05:20.041 --> 05:23.291
[boy] They told him to go down
in history, but I don't think he will.

05:23.375 --> 05:25.458
- Iron City is too small of a media market.
- Okay!

05:25.541 --> 05:27.208
I'm going to take a shower

05:27.291 --> 05:30.791
and then we'll go to the mall
and then I'll teach my posture class.

05:32.541 --> 05:36.250
- [Steffie] I didn't know we had Pringles.
- Didn't she already shower today?

05:36.333 --> 05:38.250
Can I have one? No, actually two.

05:39.541 --> 05:43.166
[boy] I'm going to give you three
because you'll ask for more later.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.666
[Steffie] Maybe I won't.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.541
[objects clatter]

05:47.625 --> 05:51.666
[man on TV] <i>Start your good breakfast</i>

05:52.458 --> 05:53.666
[girl] Dylar.

05:54.750 --> 05:57.791
- What do you want to do?
- What do you want to do?

05:57.875 --> 05:59.666
I want whatever's best for you.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.583
What's best for me is to please you.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.375
But you please me
by letting me please you.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.625
Is it wrong for the man
to be considerate to his partner?

06:07.708 --> 06:09.833
I'm your partner
when we're playing tennis,

06:09.916 --> 06:12.041
which we ought to start doing again,
by the way.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.041
Otherwise, I'm your wife.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.125
- Do you want me to read to you?
- [sighs]

06:16.208 --> 06:17.625
First rate.

06:19.250 --> 06:20.541
[Jack groans]

06:21.250 --> 06:23.291
Please don't choose anything that has

06:23.375 --> 06:27.375
men inside women or men entering women.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.041
- Got it.
- We're not lobbies or elevators.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.666
"I wanted him inside me."

06:32.750 --> 06:34.500
As if he could crawl completely in,

06:34.583 --> 06:37.000
sign the register,
sleep, eat, and so forth.

06:37.083 --> 06:40.666
I don't care what these people do as long
as they don't enter or get entered.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.625
Life is good, Jack.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.166
[Jack] What brings this on?

06:51.250 --> 06:53.291
I just feel it has to be said.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.541
I want to die first.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.416
[Jack] You sound almost eager.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.250
Life would feel
unbearably sad and lonely without you.

07:06.166 --> 07:09.625
Especially if the children
were grown up and living elsewhere.

07:10.916 --> 07:12.250
Right now we're safe.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.750
As long as the children are here.
They need us.

07:14.833 --> 07:18.916
It's great having these kids around
but once they get big and scattered,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.708
I want to go first.

07:20.791 --> 07:21.875
No, Jack.

07:21.958 --> 07:25.166
Your death would leave
an abyss in my life.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.791
I'd be left talking to chairs and pillows.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.500
Your death would be more than an abyss.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.375
- What's more than an abyss?
- A yawning gulf.

07:34.458 --> 07:38.083
Your death would be a profound depth…

07:39.541 --> 07:41.583
- A void.
- Don't be an ass.

07:41.666 --> 07:45.000
Your death would leave a bigger hole
in my life than mine would in yours.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.166
You'll be fine.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.791
You'll travel
and live a new and exciting life.

07:48.875 --> 07:52.916
I'll just sit in that chair in the suit
that I wore to your funeral forever.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.916
You're wrong.
And you don't really want to die first.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.458
You don't want to be alone,

07:58.541 --> 08:01.833
but you don't want to die
more than you don't want to be alone.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.750
I hope we both live forever.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.666
Doddering, toothless,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.083
liver-spotted, hallucinating.

08:16.541 --> 08:18.208
Who decides these things?

08:32.333 --> 08:33.875

09:08.666 --> 09:10.666
[in English] When people
are helpless and scared,

09:10.750 --> 09:12.416
they're drawn to magical figures.

09:13.041 --> 09:14.375
Mythic figures.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.541
Epic men

09:17.250 --> 09:19.458
who intimidate and darkly loom.

09:23.041 --> 09:26.166
Could you talk about
the Stauffenberg July 20 plot

09:26.250 --> 09:27.291
to kill Hitler?

09:28.250 --> 09:30.333
All plots move deathward.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.750
This is the nature of plots.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.583
Political plots,

09:36.625 --> 09:39.458
terrorist plots, lovers' plots.

09:39.541 --> 09:41.250
[Babette] Way, way up…

if you didn't mention

these lessons to anyone.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.000
You probably don't know,

but I may be

I… I teach Advanced Nazism
over at the College-on-the-Hill.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.750
So as you can understand,

11:13.833 --> 11:17.333
it's a great source of embarrassment
for me that I don't speak German.

11:17.416 --> 11:20.375
Maybe it explains the dark glasses, but…

11:21.666 --> 11:23.291
best not to analyze it.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.750
As you can probably see,

11:24.833 --> 11:28.458
something happens between the back
of my tongue and the roof of my mouth.

11:28.541 --> 11:32.583
After all, I require my students to take
a minimum of one year of German.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.208
The urgency is the Hitler conference.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.250
It's coming here
to the College-on-the-Hill in the spring,

11:41.333 --> 11:44.875
and scholars from all over Germany
will be in attendance.

11:44.958 --> 11:48.833
Do you think you can get me up to speed
on the basics of the language by then?

11:49.625 --> 11:51.041
I also teach sailing.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.416
[PA chimes]

11:53.500 --> 11:56.708
[announcer] <i>Kleenex Softique,</i>
<i>your truck's blocking the entrance.</i>

11:57.541 --> 11:58.958
This is exciting.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.333
[man] We have these in New York.

12:02.541 --> 12:04.041
The oven aroma of bread

12:04.125 --> 12:06.500
combined with the sight
of a blood-stained man

12:06.583 --> 12:10.041
pounding strips of living veal
is very exciting.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.208
Murray Suskind, this is my wife, Babette.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.791
Murray came to the college this year
from New York.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.625
- Oh.
- His specialty is living icons.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.375
You have a very impressive husband,
Mrs. Gladney.

12:19.458 --> 12:23.583
Nobody in any university in this country
can so much as utter a word about Hitler

12:23.666 --> 12:26.875
without a nod in J.A.K.'s direction,
literally or metaphorically.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.791
- He's Jack in real life.
- Hitler is now Gladney's Hitler.

12:29.875 --> 12:33.625
I marvel at what you've done with the man.
I want to do the same with Elvis.

12:33.708 --> 12:35.416
- [Steffie] My dirt.
- [girl 2] Dirt's dirt.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.041
Who are these children? Yours?

12:37.125 --> 12:39.500
Well, there's Denise, of course…

12:39.583 --> 12:43.000
[boy] "Hot" and "cold" are words.
We have to use words…

12:43.083 --> 12:45.958
- We need more Glass Plus.
- [boy] We can't just grunt.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.041
That's Heinrich…

12:47.125 --> 12:48.833
…there are more people dead today
than in the rest of world history.

12:48.916 --> 12:50.458
- [Jack] Steffie.
- We have to boil our water…

12:50.541 --> 12:52.125
[Jack] Mine from wives one and three.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.083
- There's Denise…
- On Neptune it rains diamonds.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.500
…Babette's from husband two.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.041
Wilder is ours. We're each other's fourth.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.791
[Heinrich] The French eat glands.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.375
Family is the cradle
of the world's misinformation.

13:03.458 --> 13:06.875
There must be something in family life
that generates factual error.

13:06.958 --> 13:09.791
That's because facts threaten
our happiness and security.

13:09.875 --> 13:13.166
It's the over-closeness,
the noise and the heat of being.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.958
[announcer] <i>Tegrin. Denorex. Selsun Blue.</i>

13:17.041 --> 13:19.333
[Murray] Your wife's hair
is a living wonder.

13:19.416 --> 13:20.333
[Jack] Yes, it is.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.291
- She has important hair.
- I think I know what you mean.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.708
- I hope you appreciate that woman.
- Absolutely.

13:25.791 --> 13:28.375
- A woman like that doesn't just happen.
- I know it.

13:28.458 --> 13:31.125
[announcer] <i>Dristan Ultra. Dristan Ultra.</i>

13:33.875 --> 13:36.916
That stuff causes cancer
in laboratory animals if you didn't know.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.833
You wanted me to chew sugarless gum.
It was your idea.

13:39.916 --> 13:41.833
There was no warning on the pack then.

13:41.916 --> 13:44.583
Then they put a warning,
which I don't believe you didn't see.

13:44.666 --> 13:47.583
Either I chew gum
with sugar and artificial coloring

13:47.666 --> 13:50.416
or sugarless gum
that's harmful to rats. It's up to you.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.416
Don't chew at all. Ever think of that?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.416
Denise.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.375
Steffie.

13:55.458 --> 13:58.416
- Either I chew gum or I smoke.
- [Denise] Why not do both?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.083
That's what you want, isn't it?

14:00.166 --> 14:01.666
We all get to do what we want.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.416
Unless we're not allowed to
because of our age and height.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.458
You're making a fuss over nothing.

14:06.541 --> 14:09.750
I guess you're right.
Never mind. Just a warning on the pack.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.041
- Just rats.
- Just useless rodents.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.541
Plus, I'd like to believe
she only chews two pieces a day,

14:14.625 --> 14:16.125
the way she forgets things.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.541
What do I forget?

14:17.625 --> 14:19.291
It's all right. Never mind.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.791
- What do I forget?

[announcer] <i>Uh, Cheerios spill in aisle 6.</i>

14:31.541 --> 14:33.166
<i>Sorry, aisle 4.</i>

14:33.250 --> 14:35.000
You stole my visor.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.208
Hey, give it…

14:37.208 --> 14:39.208
[announcer] <i>Sorry. Lucky Charms.</i>

14:39.291 --> 14:41.000
Tell Denise you're sorry.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.500
Maybe later. Remind me.

14:42.583 --> 14:43.625
She's a great girl

14:43.708 --> 14:47.208
and she wants to be your older sister.
And your friend, if you let her.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.750
I don't know about "friend."
She's a little bossy.

14:49.833 --> 14:52.916
Aside from telling her you're sorry,
be sure to give her back her book.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.083
It's a medical journal.
She reads it all the time. It's weird.

14:56.166 --> 14:59.208
- At least she reads something.
- It's lists of drugs and medicines.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.375
- You want to know why she reads it?
- Why?

15:01.458 --> 15:02.750
She's trying to find out

15:02.833 --> 15:05.208
the side-effects
of the stuff that Babette uses.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.000
What does Baba use?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.833
Don't ask me, ask Denise.

15:08.916 --> 15:11.541
- How do you know she uses anything?
- Ask Denise.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.833
- Why don't I ask Baba?
- Ask Baba.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.166
[pleasant music playing]

15:41.500 --> 15:45.125
[Babette] <i>I know I forget things,</i>
<i>but I didn't know it was so obvious.</i>

15:45.208 --> 15:46.208
[Jack] It isn't.

15:46.291 --> 15:49.166
[Babette] I dial a number
and forget who I'm calling.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.375
I go to the store
and I forget what to buy.

15:51.458 --> 15:52.541
[Jack] We all forget.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.250
[Babette] Sometimes
I call Steffie "Denise."

15:55.333 --> 15:57.375
I forget where I've parked the car.

15:57.458 --> 16:00.708
I don't care what the girls say.
It can't be the gum I chew.

16:00.791 --> 16:03.375
- That's too far-fetched.
- Maybe it's something else.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.541
[Babette] What do you mean?

16:04.625 --> 16:07.291
[Jack] Maybe you're taking something
besides chewing gum.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.416
- [Babette] Where did you get that idea?
- I got it from Steffie.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.500
- [Babette] Where did Steffie get it from?
- Denise.

16:12.583 --> 16:15.291
What does Denise,
through Steffie, say that I'm taking?

16:15.375 --> 16:17.291
I wanted to ask you
before I asked her.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.291
We always tell each other everything.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.291
I am not taking anything
that would affect my memory, Jack.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.541
These are the days
that I want to remember.

16:24.625 --> 16:27.291
[Jack] Everybody forgets things.
There's a lot going on.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.458
My life is either/or.

16:28.541 --> 16:31.458
Either I chew regular gum
or I chew sugarless gum.

16:31.541 --> 16:34.833
Either I chew gum or I smoke.
Either I smoke or I gain weight.

16:34.916 --> 16:38.458
Either I gain weight
or I run up the stadium steps.

16:38.541 --> 16:40.125
Sounds like a boring life.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.625
I hope it lasts forever.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.166
- Do you drink coffee yet?
- No.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.625
Baba likes a cup
when she gets back from class.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.750
Her class is demanding.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.166
- Coffee relaxes her.
- [car door closes]

16:51.250 --> 16:52.625
That's why it's dangerous.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.875
- Why is it dangerous?
- Whatever relaxes you is dangerous.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.375
[enunciating words in German]

17:22.166 --> 17:24.375
[in English] What are we
going to do about Baba?

17:24.458 --> 17:26.791
She can't remember anything
with those pills she takes.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.750
We don't know for sure
she's taking something.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.625
I saw the empty bottle in the trash
under the kitchen sink.

17:31.708 --> 17:34.208
- How do you know it was hers?
- I saw her throw it out.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.000
It had the name of the medication.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.750
- Dylar.
- Dylar?

17:37.833 --> 17:39.541
"One every three days,"

17:39.625 --> 17:42.750
which sounds like it's dangerous
or habit-forming or whatever.

17:42.833 --> 17:45.708
- What does your book say about Dylar?
- That's just it.

17:45.791 --> 17:48.333
It's not in there. I spent hours.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.791
There are four indexes.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.708
It must be recently marketed
or go by different names.

17:52.791 --> 17:55.083
- Do you want me to doublecheck?
- No, I looked.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.916
If we could get a pill,
maybe you could get it analyzed?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.875
I… I don't want to make too much of this.

17:59.958 --> 18:02.375
- We could call her doctor?
- Everybody takes medication.

18:02.458 --> 18:05.208
- Everybody forgets things occasionally.
- Not like my mother.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.708
- I forget things all the time.
- What do you take?

18:07.791 --> 18:10.750
Uh, blood-pressure pills,
stress pills, allergy pills…

18:10.833 --> 18:12.208
Eyedrops, aspirin.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.375
I looked in your medicine cabinet.
I thought there might be a new bottle.

18:15.458 --> 18:17.916
- And no Dylar?
- No.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.375
Well, maybe she's done taking it.

18:19.458 --> 18:22.125
Why don't you wanna believe
something might be wrong?

18:22.208 --> 18:24.791
We have to allow each other
to have our secrets, don't you think?

18:24.875 --> 18:27.416
She hides books on the occult
in the attic.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.166
I found them.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.541
Also, I don't think
she went to her posture class tonight.

18:32.625 --> 18:33.666
[Jack] Why do you say that?

18:33.750 --> 18:36.083
She went right
instead of left at the stop sign.

18:36.166 --> 18:39.250
- Maybe she took the scenic route.
- That's left too.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.333

Someone was here with us. Something.

23:08.583 --> 23:09.708
[professor] <i>It's natural.</i>

23:09.791 --> 23:13.083
It's normal that decent,
well-meaning people would find themselves

intrigued by catastrophe
when they see it on TV.

23:15.666 --> 23:17.791
[professor 2]
We're suffering from brain fade.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.166
We need an occasional catastrophe

23:19.250 --> 23:22.083
to break up
the incessant bombardment of information.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.500
The flow's constant.
It's words, pictures, numbers…

23:24.583 --> 23:27.500
Only catastrophe gets our attention.
We want them.

23:27.583 --> 23:29.375
This is where California comes in.

23:29.458 --> 23:31.041
Mud slides, brush fires…

23:31.125 --> 23:32.708
If I were to get you a pill…

23:32.791 --> 23:34.666
A pill? Like… a pill?

23:34.750 --> 23:35.583
Yes, a pill.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.416
- Could you analyze it?
- Jack.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.000
- Why do you ask me?
- You're brilliant.

23:39.083 --> 23:41.583
We're all brilliant.
Isn't that the understanding around here?

23:41.666 --> 23:43.416
You call me brilliant.
I call you brilliant.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.333
- We call Alfonse brilliant.
- California deserves whatever it gets.

23:46.416 --> 23:49.125
Californians invented
the concept of lifestyle.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.458
This alone warrants their doom.

23:50.541 --> 23:53.166
- Jack…
- No one calls me brilliant.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.375
They call me shrewd.
They say I latched onto something big…

23:56.458 --> 23:59.958
You're saying it's more or less universal
to be fascinated by TV disasters.

24:00.041 --> 24:02.000
- Where's the pill?
- I have to find it.

24:02.083 --> 24:05.500
[professor] …whether to feel good or bad
that my experience is widely shared.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.291
Jack, I… I need your help

power base in the department.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.000
What does Alfonse say?

24:13.083 --> 24:16.916
He seems to feel
Cotsakis has established a prior right.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.125
Cotsakis was in Memphis
when the King died.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.041
He interviewed members of his entourage…

24:21.125 --> 24:23.791
Did you take a crap
in a toilet bowl that had no seat?

24:23.875 --> 24:25.458
A great and funky men's room…

24:25.541 --> 24:29.750
To Cotsakis, Elvis is just Elvis.
But for me, Elvis is my Hitler.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.625
How can I help?

24:31.708 --> 24:34.166
If you could drop by
on my lecture this afternoon,

24:34.250 --> 24:36.500
lend a note of consequence
to the proceedings.

24:36.583 --> 24:40.041
Your prestige, your physical person.
It would mean a lot.

24:40.125 --> 24:42.291
Pissing in the snow
is also a fetish for me.

24:42.375 --> 24:46.125
These are the things we don't teach.
Bowls with no seats, pissing in sinks,

24:46.208 --> 24:47.750
the culture of public toilets.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.166
I've pissed in sinks
all through the American West.

24:50.250 --> 24:53.833
I've slipped across the border
to piss in sinks in Manitoba and Alberta.

24:53.916 --> 24:57.375
Ever had a woman peel flaking skin from
your back after a few days at the beach?

24:57.458 --> 25:00.166
Cocoa Beach, Florida. It was tremendous.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.583
Second or third greatest experience
of my life.

25:02.666 --> 25:04.458
- Was she naked?
- To the waist.

25:04.541 --> 25:06.125
[chewing] From which direction?

25:08.583 --> 25:09.833

25:50.500 --> 25:51.916
[Murray] <i>Did his mother know</i>

25:53.125 --> 25:54.750
that Elvis would die young?

25:55.833 --> 25:57.250
She talked about assassins.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.708
She talked about "the life."

26:00.791 --> 26:03.958
The life of a star
of this type and magnitude.

26:04.958 --> 26:07.666
Isn't this life structured
to cut you down early?

26:08.791 --> 26:10.708
This is the point, isn't it?

26:11.458 --> 26:13.458
There are rules, guidelines.

26:13.541 --> 26:14.833
[students murmuring]

26:17.666 --> 26:19.666
Now, I have a feeling about mothers.

26:20.541 --> 26:22.041
Mothers really do know.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.000
The folklore is correct.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.125
[Jack] Hitler adored his mother.

26:27.541 --> 26:31.125
He was the first
of Klara's children to survive infancy.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.333
Elvis and Gladys liked to nuzzle and pet.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.625
They slept in the same bed until
he began to approach physical maturity.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.541
They talked baby talk to each other.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.208
Hitler was a lazy kid.

26:42.958 --> 26:46.500
His report card
was full of unsatisfactorys.

26:46.583 --> 26:49.000
Gladys worried about his sleepwalking.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.583
She lashed out at any kid
who would bully him.

26:52.541 --> 26:55.250
Gladys walked Elvis
to school and back every day.

26:55.333 --> 26:58.291
- She defended him in street rumbles.
- But Klara loved him.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.083
Spoiled him.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.750
Gave him the attention
his father failed to give him.

27:03.833 --> 27:07.416
Elvis confided in Gladys. He brought
his girlfriends around to meet her.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.708
Hitler wrote a poem to his mother.

27:09.791 --> 27:14.083
He took piano lessons,
made sketches of museums and villas.

27:14.166 --> 27:18.208
When Elvis went into the army,
Gladys became ill and depressed.

27:18.291 --> 27:21.708
Hitler is what we call a "mama's boy."

27:21.791 --> 27:24.458
Elvis could hardly bear
to let Gladys out of his sight.

27:24.541 --> 27:27.458
As her condition grew worse,
he kept vigil at the hospital.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.916
When his mother became severely ill,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.875
Hitler put a bed in the kitchen
to be closer to her.

27:32.958 --> 27:34.833
Elvis fell apart when Gladys died.

27:34.916 --> 27:37.083
He cooked and cleaned,
he wept at the grave.

27:37.166 --> 27:40.916
- Fondled and nuzzled her in the casket.
- Fell into depression and self-pity.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.375
He talked their baby talk.

27:42.458 --> 27:45.208
For the rest of his life,
Hitler couldn't bear…

27:45.291 --> 27:48.250
…Gladys's death caused
a fundamental shift…

27:48.333 --> 27:49.875
…died near a Christmas tree.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.458
- …King's world view.
- Years later…

27:51.541 --> 27:53.583
Elvis began to withdraw…

27:53.666 --> 27:55.000
…deep remoteness…

27:55.083 --> 27:56.666
…into a state of his own dying.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.833
Hitler put a portrait of his mother
in his quarters at Obersalzberg.

27:59.916 --> 28:02.916
He began to hear
a buzzing in his left ear.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.083
Elvis fulfilled the terms of his contract.

28:07.875 --> 28:08.916
Excess,

28:10.125 --> 28:14.291
deterioration, self-destructiveness,
grotesque behavior,

28:14.375 --> 28:20.416
a physical bloating and a series
of insults to the brain, self-delivered.

28:22.958 --> 28:24.833
His place in legend is secure.

28:26.125 --> 28:31.791
He bought off the skeptics
by dying early, horribly, unnecessarily.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.416
No one could deny him now.

28:34.583 --> 28:39.416
His mother probably saw it all,
as on a 19-inch screen,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.333
years before her own death.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.333
[Jack] Picture Hitler,

28:46.000 --> 28:47.083
near the end,

28:47.166 --> 28:50.541
trapped in his Führerbunker,
beneath the burning city.

28:50.625 --> 28:53.541
He looks back
to the early days of his power,

28:53.625 --> 28:55.333
when crowds came.

28:56.125 --> 28:59.083
Mobs of people overrunning the courtyard,

28:59.166 --> 29:01.708
singing patriotic songs,

29:01.791 --> 29:06.375
painting swastikas on the walls,
on the flanks of farm animals.

29:06.458 --> 29:09.416
Crowds came to his mountain villa.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.583
Crowds came to hear him speak.

29:12.666 --> 29:15.333
Crowds erotically charged,

29:15.416 --> 29:19.500
- the masses he once called his only bride.
- [crowd clamoring faintly]

29:19.583 --> 29:24.833
Crowds came to be hypnotized by the voice,

29:24.916 --> 29:28.625
the party anthems,
the torchlight parades. But wait!

29:32.541 --> 29:34.750
How familiar this all seems to us.

29:36.333 --> 29:39.000
How close to ordinary.

29:40.041 --> 29:43.458
Crowds come, get worked up,

29:44.958 --> 29:46.500
touch and press,

29:46.583 --> 29:49.458
people eager to be transported.
Isn't this ordinary?

29:50.208 --> 29:51.500
We all know this.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.833
- We've been part of those crowds.
- [crowd squealing]

29:55.916 --> 29:59.916
But there must have been something
different about these crowds. What was it?

30:02.375 --> 30:03.208
[sighs]

30:04.875 --> 30:07.000
Let me whisper the terrible word

30:08.083 --> 30:09.541
from the Old English,

30:10.708 --> 30:12.166
from the Old German,

30:12.250 --> 30:14.458
from the Old Norse.

30:14.541 --> 30:16.250
[grunts]

30:16.333 --> 30:21.125
[whispering] Death.

30:24.250 --> 30:29.083
Death.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.500
These crowds were assembled
in the name of death.

30:36.791 --> 30:39.500
They were there
to attend tributes to the dead.

30:39.583 --> 30:40.916
But not the already dead.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.875
The future dead.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.208
The living dead amongst us.

30:48.666 --> 30:53.750
Processions, songs, speeches,
dialogues with the dead,

30:53.833 --> 30:57.208
recitations of the names of the dead.

30:57.291 --> 30:59.750
They were there
to see pyres and flaming wheels,

30:59.833 --> 31:02.916
thousands of flags dipped in salute,

31:03.000 --> 31:05.458
thousands of uniformed mourners!

31:05.541 --> 31:10.541
There were ranks and squadrons,
elaborate backdrops,

31:10.625 --> 31:13.625
blood banners and black dress uniforms.

31:13.708 --> 31:18.291
Crowds came to form a shield
against their own dying.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.791
To become a crowd is to keep out death.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.583
To break off from the crowd
is to risk death as an individual,

31:25.666 --> 31:28.041
- to face dying alone!
- [tires screeching]

31:36.458 --> 31:37.666
[panting]

31:42.041 --> 31:45.875
Crowds came for this reason
above all others.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.125
They were there to be a crowd.

32:05.916 --> 32:08.416
[screeching, grinding]

32:10.416 --> 32:11.666
[indistinct praise]

33:45.041 --> 33:47.916
<i>Do not advance the action</i>
<i>according to a plan.</i>

cough suppressants, pain reliever.

34:18.875 --> 34:20.875
[siren wailing in distance]

34:43.708 --> 34:45.958
Hey. What do you see out there?

34:46.041 --> 34:49.750
The radio said a tank car derailed,
but I don't think it derailed.

34:49.833 --> 34:52.333
It got rammed
and something punched a hole in it.

34:52.416 --> 34:54.708
There's smoke,
I don't like the looks of it.

34:54.791 --> 34:55.958
What does it look like?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.166
[siren wailing]

35:03.250 --> 35:06.541
- [Jack] You see fire engines or…
- They're all over the place.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.666
It looks to me like
they're not getting too close.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.708
It must be pretty toxic
or pretty explosive stuff.

35:12.375 --> 35:14.458
- It won't come this way.
- How do you know?

35:14.541 --> 35:15.375
It just won't.

35:15.458 --> 35:19.166
The point is, you shouldn't be standing
on ledges. It worries Baba.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.833
You think if you tell me it worries her,
I'll feel guilty and not do it.

35:22.916 --> 35:25.833
But if you tell me it worries you,
I'll do it all the time.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.250
Shut the window.

35:30.958 --> 35:32.458
Did you finish your homework?

35:32.541 --> 35:34.833
Can you see the feathery plume
from the attic?

35:34.916 --> 35:37.000
- It's not a plume.
- Will we have to leave?

35:37.083 --> 35:38.833
- Of course not.
- How do you know?

35:38.916 --> 35:39.791
I just know.

35:39.875 --> 35:42.416
What about that leak at school
and we had to evacuate?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.625
That was inside. This is outside.

35:44.708 --> 35:47.000
They're using leaf blowers
to blow stuff onto the spill.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.125
What kind of stuff?

35:48.208 --> 35:50.416
I don't know, to make the spill harmless.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.916
- Doesn't explain what they're doing.
- Keeping it from getting bigger.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.333
- When do we eat?
- [Steffie] Dunno.

35:55.416 --> 35:57.791
If it gets bigger, it'll get here
with or without a wind.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.333
- [Jack] It won't.
- How do you know?

35:59.416 --> 36:00.416
Because it won't!

36:00.500 --> 36:03.166
The radio calls it a feathery plume,
but it's not.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.083
- That's what Dad says.
- [Denise] What is it?

36:05.166 --> 36:08.875
Like a shapeless, growing thing.
A dark, black breathing thing of smoke.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.333
- Why do they call it a plume?
- Air time is valuable…

36:11.416 --> 36:13.166
[Denise] Have they said
what chemical it is?

36:13.250 --> 36:15.458
It's called Nyodene Derivative
or Nyodene D.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.833
We saw it in a movie
in school on toxic waste.

36:17.916 --> 36:20.083
- [Jack] What does it cause?
- Those videotaped rats?

36:20.166 --> 36:23.875
It wasn't sure what it does to humans.
Mainly it was rats growing urgent lumps.

36:23.958 --> 36:26.125
That's what the movie said.
What does the radio say?

36:26.208 --> 36:28.208
Skin irritation and sweaty palms.

36:28.291 --> 36:30.250
- Sweaty palms in rats?
- The radio, not the movie.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.833
They updated it to nausea,
vomiting, shortness of breath.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.708
- [Steffie] The radio or the movie?
- Both.

36:34.791 --> 36:36.625
- It won't come this way.
- How do you know?

36:36.708 --> 36:39.125
Because it won't.
It's calm and still today.

36:39.208 --> 36:41.916
Wind at this time of year,
it blows that way, not this way.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.625
- What if it blows this way?
- It won't.

36:43.708 --> 36:46.291
- What if just this one time?
- Why should it?

36:46.375 --> 36:49.333
- They closed part of the interstate.
- They would do that.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.625
- [both] Why?
- Why would they?

36:50.708 --> 36:53.416
They just would.
It's a sensible precaution.

36:53.500 --> 36:57.166
- It's a way to facilitate movement…
- Hold on, Helen. Jack is here.

36:57.250 --> 37:00.416
The Stovers say the spill
from the tank car was 35,000 gallons.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.375
Her girls were complaining
of sweaty palms.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.875
There's been a correction.
They ought to be throwing up.

37:04.958 --> 37:06.375
Is anyone nauseous?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.916
- Okay, okay. Thanks, Helen.
- [helicopter whirring]

37:09.000 --> 37:13.166
Stay in touch. The Stovers spoke directly
with the weather center outside Glassboro.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.458
They're not calling it
a feathery plume anymore.

37:15.541 --> 37:17.000
What are they calling it?

37:17.083 --> 37:18.541
A black billowing cloud.

37:18.625 --> 37:22.375
That's more accurate. They're coming
to grips with the thing. It's good.

37:22.458 --> 37:23.958
[garbage disposal crackles]

37:25.000 --> 37:28.583
It's expected that some sort of air mass
may be moving down from Canada.

37:28.666 --> 37:31.166
There's always an air mass
moving down from Canada.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.291
That's true.
There's nothing new in that.

37:33.375 --> 37:36.500
Since Canada is to the north,
if the billowing cloud is blown due south,

37:36.583 --> 37:39.083
it'll miss us by a comfortable margin.
When do we eat?

37:39.166 --> 37:41.416
Maybe we ought to be more concerned
about the cloud.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.666
- I know we don't want to scare the kids…
- Nothing is going to happen.

37:44.750 --> 37:47.750
I know nothing's going to happen,
you know nothing's going to happen,

37:47.833 --> 37:50.375
but we ought to think about it
just in case.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.791
I mean, when do we know when this is real?

37:52.875 --> 37:56.541
These things happen to people
who live in exposed areas.

37:56.625 --> 37:59.166
Society is set up, I mean sadly,

37:59.250 --> 38:02.041
in such a way
that it's the poor and uneducated

38:02.125 --> 38:05.291
who suffer the main impact
of natural and man-made disasters.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.208
It is sad.

38:06.291 --> 38:10.083
Did you ever see a college professor
rowing a boat down his own street

38:10.166 --> 38:11.625
in one of those TV floods?

38:11.708 --> 38:14.208
- Why do you want dinner so early?
- I missed lunch.

38:14.291 --> 38:18.375
- Shall I do some chili-fried chicken?
- First rate!

38:19.583 --> 38:21.291
- Where's Wilder?
- I don't know.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.458
- I ironed your gown.
- Thank you.

38:24.291 --> 38:26.833
- Did you pay the phone bill?
- I can't find it.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.750
I paid the gas and electricity.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.583
Let's think about the cloud
a little bit, okay?

38:33.666 --> 38:34.916
What if it's dangerous?

38:35.000 --> 38:37.250
Everything in train tank cars
is dangerous.

38:37.333 --> 38:38.916
But the effects are long-range.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.541
- So we die later?
- We don't die. Not from this.

38:41.625 --> 38:43.625
All we have to do
is stay out of the way.

38:43.708 --> 38:46.166
Let's be sure to keep it
in the back of our mind.

38:48.041 --> 38:51.000
Here's Wilder.
Baba's making chili-fried chicken.

38:51.083 --> 38:53.375
[Heinrich] They're calling it
a black billowing cloud.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.958
- That's what the Stovers said. It's good.
- Why is that good?

38:56.041 --> 38:59.083
I told your sister they're looking
the thing more squarely in the eye.

38:59.166 --> 39:00.166
Can you spot me?

39:00.250 --> 39:01.833
[siren wailing in distance]

39:16.541 --> 39:17.666
Okay.

39:19.583 --> 39:20.750
[grunts]

39:23.000 --> 39:26.541
Well, it's still hanging there.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.333
Looks rooted to the spot.

39:28.416 --> 39:30.875
Make sure Wilder
doesn't get into that insulation.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.791
So you don't think it'll come this way?

39:32.875 --> 39:35.458
I can tell
you know something I don't know.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.250
Think it'll come this way or not?

39:37.333 --> 39:40.875
You want me to say it won't come this way,
then you'll attack with your data.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.708
- Come here, buddy.
- What'd they say?

39:42.791 --> 39:44.708
It doesn't cause nausea, vomiting,

39:44.791 --> 39:46.541
shortness of breath,
like they said before.

39:46.625 --> 39:47.958
What does it cause?

39:48.041 --> 39:50.000
Heart palpitations and déjà vu.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.791
Déjà vu? Come on.

39:51.875 --> 39:54.458
It affects the false part
of the human brain.

39:54.541 --> 39:56.083
- I don't believe that.
- That's not all.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.500
They're not calling it
the black billowing cloud anymore.

39:58.583 --> 39:59.541
What are they calling it?

39:59.625 --> 40:01.208
The airborne toxic event.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.708
Names are not important.
The important thing is location.

40:05.791 --> 40:07.708
It's there. We're here. Wilder!

40:07.791 --> 40:09.750
A large air mass is
moving down from Canada.

40:09.833 --> 40:12.208
- We knew that.
- Doesn't mean it's not important!

40:12.291 --> 40:14.666
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Depends.

40:14.750 --> 40:16.666
The weather's about to change.

40:25.208 --> 40:26.541
[cutlery clinking]

40:35.708 --> 40:37.708
Aren't we eating a little early tonight?

40:37.791 --> 40:40.875
- What do you call early?
- 'Cause we wanna get it out of the way?

40:40.958 --> 40:42.458
What do we wanna get out of the way?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.458
- In case something happens.
- Like what?

40:44.541 --> 40:47.041
This is delicious, Baba.
You're not eating, honey.

40:47.125 --> 40:48.458
[retches]

40:49.375 --> 40:53.208
- [Babette] Denise, honey, are you okay?
- She's showing outdated symptoms.

40:53.291 --> 40:54.791
[Denise retching]

40:55.875 --> 40:58.083
- Um, Steffie, can you…
- [siren wailing]

41:03.833 --> 41:05.125
[Denise vomiting]

41:08.791 --> 41:09.708
[toilet flushing]

41:13.333 --> 41:16.166
- Baba, could you pass more of the corn?
- Sure.

41:16.250 --> 41:19.083
Thank you so much. [grunts]

41:21.208 --> 41:22.250
[grunting]

41:25.083 --> 41:28.083
- Are you feeling better?
- These peppers have a wonderful…

41:28.166 --> 41:30.125
[siren blaring]

41:30.208 --> 41:33.375
- I think that came from the firehouse.
- What's for dessert?

41:33.458 --> 41:34.916
[siren continues blaring]

41:35.000 --> 41:37.333
- [dogs barking in distance]
- [tires screeching]

41:38.666 --> 41:41.375
[Fire Captain] <i>Cloud of deadly chemicals.</i>

41:41.458 --> 41:43.958
<i>Evacuate all places of residence.</i>

41:44.666 --> 41:48.458
<i>Cloud of deadly chemicals.</i>
<i>Cloud of deadly chemicals.</i>

41:48.541 --> 41:49.708
<i>Evacuate…</i>

41:52.291 --> 41:53.625
They want us to evacuate.

41:53.708 --> 41:57.208
They were only making a suggestion
or was it a little more mandatory?

41:57.291 --> 41:58.416
It was a fire captain's car…

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
In other words,
you didn't have an opportunity

42:00.583 --> 42:02.958
to notice the subtle edges of intonation.

42:03.041 --> 42:03.958
Due to the sirens.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.541
The voice said something like,

42:05.625 --> 42:09.000
"Evacuate all places of residence.
Cloud of deadly chemicals."

42:09.083 --> 42:12.000
- "Cloud of deadly chemicals."
- [Steffie crying]

42:15.416 --> 42:16.750
[upbeat purposeful music playing]

42:16.833 --> 42:18.000
[Babette grunts]

42:18.083 --> 42:18.958
It's okay.

42:26.750 --> 42:28.541
[Babette] Jack, just leave it!

42:30.291 --> 42:32.333
Has anyone seen my ski mask?

42:37.458 --> 42:38.791
[chatters]

42:41.416 --> 42:44.291
- I couldn't find my ski mask.
- [Babette] Why do you need a ski mask?

42:44.375 --> 42:46.750
[Denise] It something you take
in these kind of things.

42:46.833 --> 42:48.916
People waste
tremendous amounts on motion.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.125
[Jack] I'm not sure
we need the plant, but…

42:51.208 --> 42:53.041
- Are we all here?
- [Babette] Accounted for.

42:53.125 --> 42:54.875
[Denise] Everyone's gone already.

42:57.666 --> 42:58.708
We're late.

42:58.791 --> 43:00.166
[engine starts]

43:00.250 --> 43:01.333
[tires screech]

43:12.541 --> 43:13.791
[radio crackling]

43:15.125 --> 43:17.708
[man on radio] <i>Blacksmith residents</i>
<i>are to take the parkway</i>

43:17.791 --> 43:20.291
<i>to the fourth service area</i>
<i>where they would proceed</i>

43:20.375 --> 43:22.541
<i>to a restaurant called Kung Fu Palace.</i>

43:22.625 --> 43:25.375
[Steffie] Is that the place
with the lily ponds and the live deer?

43:25.458 --> 43:26.375
That's right.

43:26.458 --> 43:28.708
- [Denise] Where do we go?
- [Jack] They'll tell us.

43:29.375 --> 43:31.458
- Can we play my mix?
- [Babette] Later.

43:31.541 --> 43:33.708
Was this a mild winter or a harsh winter?

43:33.791 --> 43:35.416
- [Babette] Compared to what?
- Don't know.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.916
- [man] <i>If you're from the west side…</i>
- This is us.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.750
<i>…head for the Boy Scout camp</i>
<i>called Camp Daffodil,</i>

43:40.833 --> 43:42.166
<i>where Red Cross volunteers</i>

43:42.250 --> 43:44.458
<i>- will dispense juice and coffee.</i>
- Okay, we have a plan.

43:44.541 --> 43:47.041
<i>That's Highway 10</i>
<i>after Inerson's Ford dealership…</i>

43:47.125 --> 43:48.208
[Jack] Oh, shit.

43:48.291 --> 43:51.833
<i>…between county line and Interstate 5.</i>
<i>We are being asked to stress</i>

43:51.916 --> 43:55.416
<i>that you do not attempt to shelter</i>
<i>outside your designated cachement.</i>

43:55.500 --> 43:57.208
[helicopter whirring]

44:13.625 --> 44:15.208
[horns honking]

44:17.666 --> 44:20.333
[Heinrich] The whole point
of Sir Albert Einstein is…

44:20.416 --> 44:23.333
Things should clear up
where it turns into four lanes.

44:23.416 --> 44:25.666
[Denise and Heinrich speaking]

44:25.750 --> 44:27.916
They don't look scared
in the Crown Victoria.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.333
[Denise] Yeah, they're laughing.

44:30.916 --> 44:32.291
These guys aren't laughing.

44:32.375 --> 44:34.291
- Where?
- In the Country Squire.

44:34.375 --> 44:35.666
[Denise] They look devastated.

44:35.750 --> 44:38.416
What does it matter
what they're doing in other cars?

44:38.500 --> 44:42.208
- I want to know how scared I should be.
- We just don't know at this point.

44:42.291 --> 44:44.875
- That makes me more scared.
- Don't be scared.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.625
Nobody's coming in the opposite direction.

44:47.708 --> 44:48.875
Police must have blocked…

44:48.958 --> 44:51.583
Where are the police?
Did they leave us on our own?

44:51.666 --> 44:52.500
They're around.

44:52.583 --> 44:55.375
Why are they shopping
during an airborne event?

44:55.458 --> 44:58.208
- [Heinrich] There's a sale.
- [Babette] Maybe they know something.

44:58.291 --> 45:01.541
- [Denise] Maybe there's no way out.
- Maybe it's raining Nyodene D.

45:01.625 --> 45:02.625
Is that possible?

45:02.708 --> 45:05.791
[man on radio] <i>People indoors</i>
<i>are being asked to stay indoors.</i>

45:05.875 --> 45:08.291
- Why would they say that?
- We were told to leave.

45:08.375 --> 45:09.625
<i>…you should remain there.</i>

45:09.708 --> 45:12.791
<i>If you have already evacuated,</i>
<i>find shelter immediately.</i>

45:12.875 --> 45:16.916
<i>Again, if you are indoors, remain indoors.</i>

45:17.000 --> 45:21.416
<i>If you're not, authorities are suggesting</i>
<i>you get indoors as soon as possible.</i>

45:21.500 --> 45:24.000
- [Steffie] They're passing us.
- [car honking]

45:24.083 --> 45:25.916
Technically, that's illegal--

45:26.000 --> 45:26.833
[screams]

45:34.666 --> 45:36.916
[speaking indistinctly over walkie-talkie]

45:38.625 --> 45:39.625
[woman crying]

45:45.541 --> 45:47.708
Baba cooked
chili-fried chicken for dinner.

45:47.791 --> 45:48.833
Dad's favorite.

45:49.583 --> 45:51.916
Dad said not to worry,
the plume will not come this way,

45:52.000 --> 45:54.833
but it wasn't a plume,
it was an airborne toxic event.

45:54.916 --> 45:56.875
We packed in a hurry. We ran to the car

45:56.958 --> 45:59.416
only to realize
we were latecomers to an evacuation.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.166
Is this everything that happened?

46:01.250 --> 46:04.666
Rain pelted the roof of our station wagon.
Pip-pip-pip.

46:05.583 --> 46:09.708
We hit traffic as we left
the comfort of sycamores and hedges.

46:09.791 --> 46:12.291
Dad searched for information on the radio.

46:12.375 --> 46:15.875
Traffic lined up on the freeway
like lighted-up dominos.

46:16.958 --> 46:19.375
We passed by people in distress.

46:20.291 --> 46:23.208
An unspoken bond
with our fellow journeymen formed.

46:23.291 --> 46:26.500
And then a crash.
A car flipped on the road.

46:26.583 --> 46:29.166
- People ran to their aid.
- Oh, those poor people.

46:29.250 --> 46:33.750
[Heinrich] We were waved by,
only able to watch in sympathy and awe.

46:41.916 --> 46:44.500
- [Jack] What… What's that?
- Drive the car, Jack.

46:45.125 --> 46:47.708
I saw your throat contract.
You swallowed something.

46:47.791 --> 46:50.250
Just a Life Saver.
Keep your eyes on the road.

46:50.333 --> 46:52.000
You place a Life Saver in your mouth

46:52.083 --> 46:54.541
and you swallow it
without an interval of sucking?

46:54.625 --> 46:57.166
Swallow what? It's still in my mouth.

46:57.250 --> 46:58.833
You swallowed something. I saw.

46:58.916 --> 47:01.541
That was just saliva
I didn't know what to do with.

47:01.625 --> 47:03.208
Drive the car, would you?

47:03.291 --> 47:05.166
[man on radio] <i>The situation's scary,</i>
<i>I imagine.</i>

47:05.250 --> 47:08.958
[woman on radio] <i>Yes. This is a very</i>
<i>dangerous chemical we're dealing with.</i>

47:09.041 --> 47:11.708
<i>It could affect a lot of people.</i>

47:11.791 --> 47:15.583
[man] <i>Do you have any idea how many people</i>
<i>in Glassboro have been evacuated?</i>

47:15.666 --> 47:18.291
- We're running out of gas.
- [woman] <i>I have no idea.</i>

47:18.375 --> 47:20.333
- There's always extra.
- How can there be extra?

47:20.416 --> 47:22.583
That's how tank is constructed.
So you don't run out.

47:22.666 --> 47:24.750
Can't be.
If you keep going, you run out.

47:24.833 --> 47:26.625
You don't keep going forever.

47:26.708 --> 47:29.666
- How do you know when to stop?
- When you pass a gas station.

47:29.750 --> 47:31.000
Look.

47:40.333 --> 47:41.166
[bell dings]

47:52.083 --> 47:54.125
[window creaking, thudding]

48:03.000 --> 48:04.375
No one's here.

48:21.500 --> 48:22.541
It's working.

48:22.625 --> 48:23.958
[speaking indistinctly]

48:34.958 --> 48:36.916
[wind howling]

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
[eerie music playing]

48:47.750 --> 48:48.750
[gasps]

49:14.833 --> 49:16.708
[electrical buzzing]

49:20.208 --> 49:21.041
[rain stops]

49:26.875 --> 49:28.208
[static]

49:28.291 --> 49:30.291
[electrical buzzing]

49:36.708 --> 49:38.000
[thunder rumbling]

49:38.916 --> 49:40.083
[rain pattering]

49:45.583 --> 49:46.833
You didn't pay, Dad.

49:47.750 --> 49:48.916
There was nobody there.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
You could've left money
on the counter.

49:51.083 --> 49:53.833
- [car honks]
- I was in a hurry.

49:53.916 --> 49:57.291
- I… I'll send them a check.
- Yeah, but you probably won't do that.

49:57.375 --> 49:59.625
What happens if the dogs get contaminated?

49:59.708 --> 50:01.833
- [Babette] Nothing happens to dogs.
- How do you know?

50:01.916 --> 50:03.791
- Ask Jack.
- Ask Heinrich.

50:03.875 --> 50:07.083
Could be true. They use rats
to test for things humans can get,

50:07.166 --> 50:08.916
means we catch the same diseases.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.458
They wouldn't use dogs
if they thought it could hurt them.

50:11.541 --> 50:13.916
- [Denise] Why not?
- A dog is a mammal.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.750
- So is a rat.
- [Babette] A rat is a vermin.

50:15.833 --> 50:18.500
- Mostly, it's a rodent.
- [Babette] It's also a vermin.

50:18.583 --> 50:21.250
- A cockroach is a vermin.
- [Babette] A cockroach is an insect.

50:21.333 --> 50:23.166
You count the legs, is how you know.

50:23.250 --> 50:25.250
- It's also a vermin.
- Does a cockroach…

50:25.333 --> 50:28.666
Family is the cradle
of the world's misinformation.

50:28.750 --> 50:31.625
…than it is like a cockroach,
even if they're both vermin.

50:31.708 --> 50:34.708
[echoing] Since a rat and a human
can get cancer but a cockroach can't.

50:34.791 --> 50:37.208
What she's saying is
two things that are mammals

50:37.291 --> 50:39.666
have more in common
than two things that are only vermins.

50:39.750 --> 50:42.333
[Babette] Are you telling me
a rat is not only

50:42.416 --> 50:45.041
a vermin and a rodent, but a mammal too?

50:45.125 --> 50:46.333
Oh, shit.

50:46.416 --> 50:48.666
[dramatic music playing]

50:48.750 --> 50:50.041
[helicopter whirring]

50:56.250 --> 50:57.666
[thunder rumbling]

51:30.000 --> 51:32.583
[Heinrich] Look at it. Look at it.

51:32.666 --> 51:34.333
- Can I see through those?
- Me too.

51:34.416 --> 51:36.000
Come on, kids, share. Please.

51:36.083 --> 51:39.916
- We are! No… I'll look first and then--
- No, share. Actually share.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
[arguing]

51:49.083 --> 51:50.375
[speaking indistinctly]

52:11.041 --> 52:12.458
[thunder rumbling]

52:28.458 --> 52:29.708
[speaking indistinctly]

52:35.375 --> 52:36.833
Welcome to Camp Daffodil.

52:57.958 --> 52:59.416
[radio crackles]

53:00.416 --> 53:03.875
I heard we'll be able to go home
first thing in the morning.

53:03.958 --> 53:05.916
I don't know if I want to go home.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.166
My mother-in-law's been staying with us.

53:08.250 --> 53:11.083
- This has been a respite.
- [evacuee 1] Heard it might be two weeks.

53:11.166 --> 53:12.875
[evacuee 2] The government knows more…

53:12.958 --> 53:14.583
[evacuee 3] The reports are coming in
fast and furious.

53:14.666 --> 53:15.958
And they're not saying jack shit.

53:16.041 --> 53:19.458
A helicopter flew into a toxic cloud
and completely disappeared.

53:19.541 --> 53:21.666
I can think of at least seven things
that could mean.

53:21.750 --> 53:23.375
I can think of six, what's the seventh?

53:23.458 --> 53:25.958
Well, without knowing the six
you're talking about…

53:26.041 --> 53:27.791
The dogs are in from New Mexico,

53:27.875 --> 53:30.541
they parachuted into a meadow
in a daring night drop.

53:30.625 --> 53:31.750
Those are real heroes.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.541
[Babette] "A world-renowned institute
has used hypnosis to induce

53:34.625 --> 53:38.208
hundreds of people
to recall their previous life experiences

53:38.291 --> 53:42.708
as pyramid builders,
exchange students and extraterrestrials."

53:42.791 --> 53:47.458
"In the last year alone," declares
reincarnation hypnotist Ling Ti Wan,

53:47.541 --> 53:49.750
"I have helped hundreds
to regress to previous lives…"

53:49.833 --> 53:52.500
[Heinrich] …they sprayed
on the big spill was probably soda ash.

53:52.583 --> 53:54.291
It was a case of too little, too late.

53:54.375 --> 53:57.416
My guess is they'll get some crop dusters
up in the air at daybreak

53:57.500 --> 54:00.416
and bombard the toxic cloud
with lots more soda ash,

54:00.500 --> 54:04.208
which could break it up and scatter it
in a million harmless puffs.

54:04.291 --> 54:07.166
Soda ash is the common name
for sodium carbonate,

54:07.250 --> 54:11.708
which is used in the manufacture
of glass, ceramics, detergents and soaps.

54:11.791 --> 54:14.375
It's also what they use
to make bicarbonate of soda,

54:14.458 --> 54:18.500
which is something I'm sure a lot of you
have guzzled after a night on the town.

54:18.583 --> 54:19.541
[all chuckle]

54:19.625 --> 54:22.000
[Heinrich] So what you're all
probably wondering

54:22.083 --> 54:23.750
is what exactly is this Nyodene D

54:23.833 --> 54:25.458
we keep hearing about.

54:25.541 --> 54:27.500
Well, I'm glad you asked that.

54:27.583 --> 54:32.125
In powder form, it's colorless,
odorless and incredibly dangerous.

54:32.208 --> 54:34.041
[evacuees chattering indistinctly]

54:36.166 --> 54:38.208
[evacuee 4] Two looters are dead…

54:38.291 --> 54:41.166
[evacuee 5] There have been
a bunch of UFO sightings around this area.

54:41.250 --> 54:44.666
[evacuee 6] Ronald Reagan. Do you know
that he was going to be in <i>Casablanca?</i>

54:44.750 --> 54:46.666
Heinrich seems to be
coming out of his shell.

54:46.750 --> 54:48.541
Where's he? I haven't seen him.

54:48.625 --> 54:50.083
You see that knot of people?

54:50.166 --> 54:52.375
Don't stand up.
He's right in the middle.

54:52.458 --> 54:55.333
He's telling them
what he knows about the toxic event.

54:55.416 --> 54:58.333
- What does he know?
- Quite a lot, it turns out.

54:58.416 --> 55:00.041
Why didn't he tell us?

55:00.125 --> 55:02.041
He probably doesn't think
it's worth his while

55:02.125 --> 55:04.208
to be funny and charming
in front of his family.

55:04.291 --> 55:06.041
We present the wrong kind of challenge.

55:06.125 --> 55:08.041
Don't you think you ought to go there,

55:08.125 --> 55:10.250
show him his father is there
for his big moment?

55:10.333 --> 55:13.083
- He'll get upset if he sees me.
- What if I went over?

55:13.166 --> 55:15.291
- He'll think I sent you.
- Is that so awful?

55:19.083 --> 55:21.541
- Just a Life Saver?
- What?

55:21.625 --> 55:24.125
Just some saliva
you didn't know what to do with?

55:24.208 --> 55:25.416
It was a Life Saver.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.208
- Give me one.
- It was the last one.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.041
- What flavor? Quick.
- Cherry.

55:30.625 --> 55:32.666
[technician 1] Attention, attention.

55:33.291 --> 55:37.208
If you have been exposed
to the airborne toxic event

55:37.291 --> 55:41.041
for any amount of time
longer than ten seconds,

55:41.125 --> 55:44.166
<i>- </i>proceed to the front…
- Didn't you hear what the voice said?

55:44.250 --> 55:46.500
- Something about exposure.
- That's right.

55:46.583 --> 55:48.083
What's that got to do with us?

55:48.166 --> 55:49.958
Not us. You.

55:50.041 --> 55:51.291
Why me?

55:51.375 --> 55:54.541
Weren't you the one who got out of the car
to fill the gas tank?

55:54.625 --> 55:57.083
But the airborne event
wasn't on top of us then.

55:57.166 --> 55:58.625
It was ahead of us.

55:58.708 --> 56:02.208
Remember you got back in the car
and there it was in all those lights.

56:02.291 --> 56:04.208
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

56:04.291 --> 56:07.625
You're saying when I got out,
the cloud may have been close enough

56:07.708 --> 56:09.250
to rain all over me?

56:09.333 --> 56:10.375
It's not your fault,

56:10.458 --> 56:13.916
but you were practically right in it
for two and a half minutes.

56:15.750 --> 56:19.166
- How long were you out there?
- Denise said two and a half minutes.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.125
[crying]

56:21.208 --> 56:22.875
Is that considered long or short?

56:22.958 --> 56:24.583
Anything that puts you into skin

56:24.666 --> 56:27.875
and orifice contact with the emissions
means we have a situation.

56:27.958 --> 56:28.958
This Nyodene D…

56:29.041 --> 56:30.250
Congratulations!

56:30.333 --> 56:32.833
[technician 2] …new generation
of toxic waste. State of the art.

56:32.916 --> 56:35.833
One part per million
can send a rat into a permanent state.

56:35.916 --> 56:37.958
What about the people in the car?

56:38.041 --> 56:40.291
I had to open the door
to get out and back in.

56:40.375 --> 56:43.000
I'd say their situation
is they're minimal risks.

56:43.083 --> 56:46.750
It's the two and a half minutes
standing right in it which makes me wince.

56:46.833 --> 56:50.375
- What does SIMUVAC stand for?
- It's short for "simulated evacuation."

56:50.458 --> 56:52.791
A new state program
they're battling over funds for.

56:52.875 --> 56:54.500
This evacuation isn't simulated.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.625
- It's real.
- We know.

56:55.708 --> 56:57.875
But we thought
we could use that as a model.

56:57.958 --> 57:00.208
Are you saying
you saw the chance to use the

57:01.000 --> 57:03.541
real event in order
to rehearse the simulation?

57:03.625 --> 57:05.875
We took it right to the streets.

57:05.958 --> 57:06.833
How's it going?

57:07.416 --> 57:09.708
The insertion curve
isn't as smooth as we'd like.

57:09.791 --> 57:11.958
We don't have our victims laid out
where we'd want them

57:12.041 --> 57:13.708
if this was an actual simulation.

57:13.791 --> 57:16.833
You've to make allowances for the fact
that everything tonight is real.

57:16.916 --> 57:18.416
What about the computers?

57:18.500 --> 57:21.958
Is that real data you're running through
the system or practice stuff?

57:22.041 --> 57:23.291
You watch.

57:23.375 --> 57:25.166
[keyboard clacking]

57:27.875 --> 57:29.875
I was outside
for two and a half minutes.

57:29.958 --> 57:32.958
The only thing
that she was exposed to is good luck.

57:34.291 --> 57:35.750
That's how many seconds?

57:35.833 --> 57:39.333
I'm getting bracketed numbers
with pulsing stars.

57:39.416 --> 57:40.541
What does that mean?

57:41.708 --> 57:44.000
- I mean, am I going to die?
- Not as such.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.458
- What do you mean?
- Not in so many words.

57:48.166 --> 57:49.833
How many words does it take?

57:49.916 --> 57:52.125
It's not a question of words,
but of years.

57:52.208 --> 57:53.625
We'll know more in 15 years.

57:53.708 --> 57:56.125
In the meantime,
we definitely have a situation.

57:56.208 --> 57:57.750
What will we know in 15 years?

57:57.833 --> 58:02.250
If you're still alive at that time,
we'll know much more than we know now.

58:02.333 --> 58:04.875
The Nyodene D has a life span
of roughly 30 years,

58:04.958 --> 58:06.541
so you'll have made it halfway through.

58:06.625 --> 58:09.916
To outlive this substance,
I'll have to make it into my seventies?

58:10.708 --> 58:13.958
I wouldn't worry
about what I can't see or feel.

58:14.041 --> 58:16.416
Now, I'd go ahead and live my life.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.750
- Get married, settle down, have kids.
- [sighs]

58:18.833 --> 58:22.083
There's no reason you can't do
these things, knowing what we know.

58:22.166 --> 58:25.500
- But you said we have a situation.
- I didn't. The computer did.

58:25.583 --> 58:27.750
What the computer says
is not a simulation,

58:27.833 --> 58:31.000
despite that armband you're wearing.
It is real.

58:31.083 --> 58:32.041
It is real.

58:35.375 --> 58:37.166
[evacuees speaking indistinctly]

58:37.250 --> 58:38.166
Thank you.

58:46.958 --> 58:49.916
[evacuee 1, faintly] They want you
to think it's a train crash, but actually…

58:50.416 --> 58:51.250
it's a dirty nuke.

58:51.333 --> 58:52.375
Murray!

58:53.208 --> 58:54.208
- You're here.
- Jack.

58:54.291 --> 58:55.291
Hey, big boy.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.541
All white people
have a favorite Elvis song.

58:57.625 --> 58:59.875
I thought you were going to New York.

58:59.958 --> 59:02.083
I stayed back to look at car crash movies.

59:02.166 --> 59:05.416
I heard a rumor about painted women
and came out to investigate.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.625
One of them says
she has a snap-off crotch.

59:07.708 --> 59:10.375
- What do you think she means?
- They don't seem busy.

59:10.458 --> 59:14.375
I don't think this is the kind of disaster
that leads to sexual abandon.

59:14.458 --> 59:17.208
We might get one or two fellows
skulking out eventually,

59:17.291 --> 59:20.250
but there won't be an orgiastic horde,
not tonight anyway.

59:20.333 --> 59:23.333
- Any episodes of déjà vu in your group?
- No.

59:24.666 --> 59:26.708
Any episodes of déjà vu in your group?

59:28.125 --> 59:30.500
Why do we think
these things happened before?

59:31.333 --> 59:36.750
Simple. They did happen before,
in our minds, as visions of the future.

59:36.833 --> 59:38.333
Supernatural stuff.

59:38.416 --> 59:41.416
Maybe when we die,
the first thing we'll say is,

59:42.541 --> 59:46.000
"I know this feeling. I was here before."

59:48.583 --> 59:49.625
How are you doing?

59:51.625 --> 59:52.875
I'm dying, Murray.

59:53.666 --> 59:57.250
I spent two and a half minutes
exposed to the toxic cloud.

59:57.333 --> 1:00:00.333
Even if it doesn't kill me
in a direct way,

1:00:00.416 --> 1:00:02.125
it will outlive me in my own body.

1:00:02.208 --> 1:00:05.541
I could die in a plane crash
and the Nyodene D would be thriving

1:00:05.625 --> 1:00:07.500
as my remains were laid to rest.

1:00:07.583 --> 1:00:08.708
A computer told me.

1:00:08.791 --> 1:00:10.791
I'm truly sorry, my friend.

1:00:10.875 --> 1:00:12.875
But computers make mistakes.

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:14.333
[chuckles]

1:00:14.416 --> 1:00:16.250
Carpet static can cause a mistake.

1:00:16.333 --> 1:00:18.500
It was in the barrack.
There was no carpet.

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:22.000
Lint. Hair in the circuits.
There are always mistakes.

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:24.125
Not a word to Babette about any of this.

1:00:24.208 --> 1:00:25.875
- She'd be devastated.
- Of course.

1:00:25.958 --> 1:00:29.000
Sometimes I actually think
I see it coming for me.

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:30.916
At night, usually.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.416
The thing I've always feared,
and now it's here.

1:00:34.791 --> 1:00:37.166
We're all aware
there's no escape from death.

1:00:37.250 --> 1:00:39.625
And how do we deal
with this crushing knowledge?

1:00:39.708 --> 1:00:42.625
We repress, we disguise.
But you don't know how to repress.

1:00:42.708 --> 1:00:46.208
Wish there was something I could do,
and I could out-think the problem.

1:00:46.291 --> 1:00:50.166
You thought Hitler would protect you.
Some people are larger than life.

1:00:50.250 --> 1:00:53.291
Hitler is larger than death.
I understand completely.

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:55.875
Do you? Because I wish I did.

1:00:55.958 --> 1:00:57.166
It's totally obvious.

1:00:57.250 --> 1:01:00.416
The overwhelming horror
would leave no room for your own death.

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:03.333
It's a daring thing you did,
a daring thrust.

1:01:03.416 --> 1:01:04.458
Daring but dumb.

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:10.041
If I could just lose interest in myself.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:13.875
Here, take this. I have another one
at home in the drawer under my hotplate.

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.083
Heft it around. Get the feel.

1:01:16.833 --> 1:01:17.791
It's loaded.

1:01:18.458 --> 1:01:20.791
It's an itty-bitty thing,
but it shoots real bullets.

1:01:20.875 --> 1:01:24.750
It's a .25-caliber Zumwalt automatic.
German-made. Up your alley.

1:01:24.833 --> 1:01:26.833
I… I don't want it.

1:01:26.916 --> 1:01:30.625
I believe, Jack, there are two kinds
of people in the world.

1:01:30.708 --> 1:01:33.166
Killers and diers. Most of us are diers.

1:01:33.791 --> 1:01:37.291
We don't have the dispositions, the rage,
what it takes to be a killer.

1:01:37.375 --> 1:01:41.875
But think how exciting it is,
in theory, to kill a person.

1:01:41.958 --> 1:01:44.333
If he dies, you cannot.

1:01:44.416 --> 1:01:49.166
To kill him is to gain life-credit.
Who knows?

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:51.583
Maybe violence is a form of rebirth.

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:54.875
And maybe you can kill death.

1:01:57.250 --> 1:01:58.458
[guitar music playing]

1:02:00.041 --> 1:02:03.291
[puppeteer] And they were running
because they didn't know what to do.

1:02:03.375 --> 1:02:04.958
The townspeople were scared.

1:02:05.041 --> 1:02:08.625
They were in awe of the cloud,
it was beautiful above their heads…

[Jack] Doesn't anyone want to pay
attention to what's actually happening?

1:07:45.708 --> 1:07:48.041

No, I don't want credit.

Everything we loved and worked for
is under serious threat.

1:12:14.791 --> 1:12:17.666
Even if there hasn't been
great loss of life,

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:20.833
don't we deserve attention
for our suffering?

1:12:20.916 --> 1:12:22.916

- [evacuee 3] Yes!

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.458

1:12:51.750 --> 1:12:54.250
You were standing there,
I was standing here.

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:58.541
Your features incredibly sharp and clear.

1:12:59.250 --> 1:13:01.708
It all happened before.
Hissing in the pipes.

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:04.125
Tiny little hairs
standing out in your pores,

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:05.875
that identical look in your face.

1:13:06.875 --> 1:13:08.041
What look?

1:13:08.833 --> 1:13:10.250
Haunted.

1:13:11.125 --> 1:13:12.208
Ashen.

1:13:13.541 --> 1:13:14.541
Lost.

[announcer] <i>Welcome back, shoppers.</i>

1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:29.166
It's comforting to know
the supermarket hasn't changed

1:13:29.250 --> 1:13:30.500
since the toxic event.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.416
In fact, the supermarket
has only gotten better.

1:13:35.833 --> 1:13:38.208
Between the unpackaged meat
and the fresh bread,

1:13:38.291 --> 1:13:40.625
it's like a Persian bazaar.

1:13:40.708 --> 1:13:42.125
Everything is fine,

1:13:42.208 --> 1:13:45.625
and will continue to be fine
as long as the supermarket doesn't slip.

1:13:49.458 --> 1:13:52.500
Do you know the Tibetans
believe there's a transitional state

1:13:52.583 --> 1:13:54.541
between death and rebirth?

1:13:54.625 --> 1:13:57.625
- [announcer continues]
- That's what I think when I come here.

1:13:58.291 --> 1:14:02.375
The supermarket is a waiting place.
It recharges us spiritually.

1:14:02.458 --> 1:14:03.541
It's a gateway.

1:14:04.458 --> 1:14:07.916
Look how bright.
Look how full of psychic data,

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.375
waves and radiation.

1:14:09.458 --> 1:14:12.875
All the letters and numbers are here,
all the colors of the spectrum,

1:14:12.958 --> 1:14:17.458
all the voices and sounds,
all the code words and ceremonial phrases.

1:14:17.541 --> 1:14:19.541
We just have to know how to decipher it.

1:14:19.625 --> 1:14:21.375
[shopper] Whoa! Oh, jeez!

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:23.208
How's that lovely woman of yours?

1:14:23.916 --> 1:14:26.791
She's been different,
somehow, since the event.

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:29.250
We've suffered a collective trauma.

1:14:29.333 --> 1:14:31.541
She wears her sweatsuit all the time.

1:14:31.625 --> 1:14:34.375
She stares out of windows
and cries for no reason.

1:14:34.458 --> 1:14:35.916
I don't know how to help her.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.708
I've been distracted
preparing for the Hitler conference--

1:14:38.791 --> 1:14:41.083
- And the kids?
- Back in school.

1:14:41.166 --> 1:14:43.541
Steffie no longer wears
her protective mask.

1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:45.500
And you?

1:14:45.583 --> 1:14:48.208
I've got another
doctor's appointment tomorrow.

1:14:48.291 --> 1:14:50.375
What does he say
about your status as a doomed man?

1:14:50.458 --> 1:14:51.500
I haven't told him.

1:14:51.583 --> 1:14:54.958
Since he hasn't found anything wrong,
I'm not going to bring it up.

1:14:55.041 --> 1:14:57.583
- I lie to doctors all the time.
- So do I.

1:14:57.666 --> 1:14:58.625
But why?

1:14:59.333 --> 1:15:01.916
Do you know the Elvis struggle
you helped me with?

1:15:02.625 --> 1:15:05.250
It turns out, tragically,
I would've won anyway.

1:15:05.333 --> 1:15:08.541
- What happened?
- Cotsakis, my rival,

1:15:09.666 --> 1:15:11.625
is no longer in the land of the living.

1:15:11.708 --> 1:15:12.791
- He's--
- Dead.

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:15.750
Lost in the surf off Malibu.

1:15:15.833 --> 1:15:17.000
During term break.

1:15:17.083 --> 1:15:19.291
I found out an hour ago,
came right here.

1:15:20.208 --> 1:15:21.750
I'm sorry to tell you.

1:15:21.833 --> 1:15:23.958
Particularly because of your condition.

1:15:24.916 --> 1:15:26.208
Poor Cotsakis.

1:15:27.458 --> 1:15:29.083
Lost in the surf?

1:15:30.375 --> 1:15:31.708
That enormous man.

1:15:31.791 --> 1:15:34.250
- He was big, all right.
- Enormously so.

1:15:34.333 --> 1:15:37.250
- He must've weighed 300 pounds.
- Oh. Easily.

1:15:37.333 --> 1:15:39.708
Dead! A big man like that.

1:15:39.791 --> 1:15:42.750
It's better not knowing them
when they die, but better them than us.

1:15:42.833 --> 1:15:45.541
To be so enormous. Then to die.

1:15:46.875 --> 1:15:48.916
I can picture him so clearly.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.166
Maybe once we stop denying death,
we can proceed calmly to die.

1:15:53.250 --> 1:15:55.875
We simply walk toward the sliding doors.

1:16:23.375 --> 1:16:26.333
[cash register dings echo ominously]

1:16:32.958 --> 1:16:35.083
[Jack] What if death is nothing but sound?

1:16:37.416 --> 1:16:41.333
You hear it forever. Sound, all around.

1:16:42.291 --> 1:16:44.541
- [Murray] Uniform, white.
- [clacks]

1:16:53.625 --> 1:16:55.250
It's strange in a way, isn't it?

1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:58.875
That we can picture the dead.

1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:02.000
[announcer] <i>Disregard last announcement.</i>
<i>Disregard.</i>

1:17:02.958 --> 1:17:03.958
<i>Hold on, what?</i>

1:17:04.625 --> 1:17:05.833
<i>Oh, regard.</i>

1:17:21.625 --> 1:17:23.583
Why so many checkups, Mr. Gladney?

1:17:23.666 --> 1:17:27.000
In the past, you were always afraid
to know if anything was wrong.

1:17:27.083 --> 1:17:28.083
I'm still afraid.

1:17:28.791 --> 1:17:33.000
Well, I'm glad you're finally taking
your status as patient seriously.

1:17:33.083 --> 1:17:33.916
My status?

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:35.916
Once people leave the doctor's office,

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.083
they tend to forget
that they are patients.

1:17:38.166 --> 1:17:41.625
But a doctor doesn't cease
being a doctor at close of day.

1:17:41.708 --> 1:17:43.500
Neither should patient.

1:17:44.291 --> 1:17:46.666
I don't like your potassium
very much at all.

1:17:46.750 --> 1:17:49.666
- What's that mean?
- There isn't time to explain.

1:17:49.750 --> 1:17:51.916
We have true elevation
and false elevation.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:53.416
That's all you need to know.

1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:55.666
Exactly how elevated is my potassium?

1:17:55.750 --> 1:17:57.916
It's gone through the roof evidently.

1:17:58.541 --> 1:18:02.875
Could this potassium be
an indication of some condition

1:18:02.958 --> 1:18:05.083
just beginning to manifest itself?

1:18:05.166 --> 1:18:09.333
Some condition
caused perhaps by an exposure,

1:18:09.416 --> 1:18:15.458
an involuntary spillage-intake,
some substance, say, in the air or rain?

1:18:15.541 --> 1:18:18.000
Have you come in contact
with such a substance?

1:18:18.083 --> 1:18:19.666
Were you exposed to that cloud?

1:18:19.750 --> 1:18:22.583
Why? Do the numbers show
some sign of possible exposure?

1:18:22.666 --> 1:18:26.750
If you haven't been exposed, then
they couldn't show a sign, could they?

1:18:26.833 --> 1:18:28.000
Then we agree.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:30.083
And you'd have no reason to lie to me.

1:18:33.041 --> 1:18:36.333
I'm going to send you
to Glassboro for further tests.

1:18:36.416 --> 1:18:40.041
They have a brand-new facility
called Autumn Harvest Farms.

1:18:40.125 --> 1:18:41.208
Have you heard of it?

1:18:42.416 --> 1:18:44.375
They have gleaming new equipment.

1:18:44.458 --> 1:18:46.916
It gleams, absolutely.

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.750
Tell them to send you back to me
with sealed results.

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:54.041
Together, as doctor and patient,

1:18:54.125 --> 1:18:57.166
we can do things
that neither of us could do separately.

1:18:57.250 --> 1:18:59.375
Uh, Dr. Lu, have you heard of Dylar?

1:19:00.416 --> 1:19:03.041
- Is that an island in the Persian Gulf?
- No, it's a--

1:19:03.125 --> 1:19:05.583
Oil terminals
crucial to the survival of the West.

1:19:05.666 --> 1:19:08.375
[overlapping] Something that comes
in a little white tablet.

1:19:08.458 --> 1:19:09.666
Never heard of it.

[Heinrich] The real issue is the radiation
that surrounds us every day.

1:19:56.541 --> 1:20:00.333
Your radio, your TV, your microwave oven,
the powerlines outside your door.

1:20:00.416 --> 1:20:01.625
Forget toxic clouds.

1:20:01.708 --> 1:20:05.666
It's the electrical and magnetic fields.
Industry would collapse

1:20:05.750 --> 1:20:08.958
if the true results of any of
these investigations were released.

1:20:09.041 --> 1:20:10.250
Is Wilder talking less now?

1:20:10.333 --> 1:20:11.625
If they release the findings,

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:13.416
there'd be
billions of dollars in lawsuits.

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:15.375
- That's a little extreme.
- [footsteps]

1:20:15.458 --> 1:20:17.708
[Heinrich] What's extreme,
what I said or what'd happen?

1:20:17.791 --> 1:20:19.291
[Steffie] Why are mountains upstate?

1:20:19.375 --> 1:20:21.583
- [Denise] Mountains are always upstate.
- Say more.

1:20:21.666 --> 1:20:23.416
The snow melts
as planned in the spring,

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:25.958
and flows down
to the reservoirs near the cities,

1:20:26.041 --> 1:20:28.500
which are kept in the lower end
for this reason.

1:20:28.583 --> 1:20:30.291
- [Jack] Is that true?
- What do you think?

1:20:30.375 --> 1:20:32.625
- I honestly don't know.
- Kids, listen to me.

1:20:33.625 --> 1:20:35.708
Hold hands when you cross the street.

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:38.541
Be careful around swimming pools.

1:20:39.250 --> 1:20:42.125
If you think someone is a kidnapper,
they probably are.

1:20:45.166 --> 1:20:46.166
Where are you going?

1:20:46.250 --> 1:20:48.791
They gave me a new class at the church.

1:20:48.875 --> 1:20:50.750
- [Jack] In what?
- Eating and drinking.

1:20:50.833 --> 1:20:52.708
- Isn't that obvious?
- What's there to teach?

1:20:52.791 --> 1:20:54.791
Isn't it kind of late?
It's almost night.

1:20:54.875 --> 1:20:56.041
What is night?

1:20:56.125 --> 1:20:59.500
It happens seven times a week.
Where is the uniqueness in this?

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.208
Jack,

1:21:05.291 --> 1:21:08.041
can you help me
with my homework after dinner?

1:21:10.208 --> 1:21:12.708
Homework was a canard.
I wanna show you something.

1:21:27.916 --> 1:21:28.958
Dylar.

1:21:29.833 --> 1:21:34.041
There were four left. Take one for proof.
We need physical evidence.

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:37.708
- We say nothing to Baba.
- All right.

1:21:37.791 --> 1:21:40.041
She'll say she doesn't remember
why she put them there.

1:21:40.125 --> 1:21:42.166
I'll go to the drugstore in the morning

1:21:42.250 --> 1:21:44.041
and ask the pharmacist about Dylar.

1:21:44.125 --> 1:21:45.875
- I already did that.
- When?

1:21:45.958 --> 1:21:46.916
Around Christmas.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.041
- I went to three drugstores.
- What'd they say?

1:21:49.125 --> 1:21:50.416
Never heard of it.

1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:52.291
- It's not on any list.
- Unlisted.

1:21:52.375 --> 1:21:55.458
- We have to call her doctor.
- I'll call him tomorrow.

1:21:55.541 --> 1:21:56.875
[upset] Call him now!

1:21:56.958 --> 1:21:59.791
This is serious, Jack.
Something is wrong with her.

1:21:59.875 --> 1:22:01.958
I'll call him now. I'll call him at home.

1:22:02.041 --> 1:22:02.875
Surprise him.

1:22:02.958 --> 1:22:05.708
If I get him at home,
I won't be screened by a receptionist.

1:22:05.791 --> 1:22:07.416
Call him at home. Wake him up.

1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:09.458
Trick him into telling us
what we wanna know.

1:22:09.541 --> 1:22:11.291
I'll call him at home. Wake him up.

1:22:11.375 --> 1:22:13.625
Trick him into telling us
what we wanna know.

1:22:13.708 --> 1:22:15.250
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Dr. Hookstratten.

1:22:15.333 --> 1:22:18.333
This is Jack Gladney,
you treat my wife, Babette.

1:22:18.416 --> 1:22:19.250
<i>Okay.</i>

1:22:19.333 --> 1:22:23.041
I'm sorry to call you at home,
but I'm concerned about Babette.

1:22:23.125 --> 1:22:27.333
And I'm pretty sure the medication
you prescribed is causing the problem.

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:28.416
<i>What problem?</i>

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:29.791
Memory lapse.

1:22:29.875 --> 1:22:32.791
<i>You would call a doctor at home</i>
<i>to talk about memory lapse?</i>

1:22:32.875 --> 1:22:36.541
<i>If everyone with memory lapse called</i>
<i>a doctor at home, what would we have?</i>

1:22:36.625 --> 1:22:38.250
<i>The ripple effect would be tremendous.</i>

1:22:38.333 --> 1:22:40.291
They are frequent, the lapses.

1:22:40.375 --> 1:22:41.708
Frequent and prolonged.

1:22:41.791 --> 1:22:45.000
<i>You would call a doctor</i>
<i>at ten o'clock at night,</i>

1:22:45.083 --> 1:22:47.083
<i>you would say to him "memory lapse."</i>

1:22:47.916 --> 1:22:50.958
<i>Why not tell me she has gas?</i>
<i>Call me at home for gas.</i>

1:22:51.041 --> 1:22:54.250
Frequent and prolonged, doctor.
It has to be the medication.

1:22:54.333 --> 1:22:55.291
<i>What medication?</i>

1:22:55.375 --> 1:22:56.583
- Dylar.
- Dylar.

1:22:56.666 --> 1:22:57.666
<i>Never heard of it.</i>

1:22:57.750 --> 1:22:59.500
A small white tablet.

1:22:59.583 --> 1:23:00.916
Comes in an amber bottle.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000
Comes in an amber--

1:23:02.083 --> 1:23:04.958
<i>You would describe a tablet</i>
<i>as small and white</i>

1:23:05.041 --> 1:23:09.208
<i>and expect a doctor to respond</i>
<i>at home, after 10:00 at night.</i>

1:23:09.291 --> 1:23:12.500
<i>Why not tell me it is round?</i>
<i>This is crucial to our case.</i>

1:23:12.583 --> 1:23:14.625
It's an unlisted drug.

1:23:14.708 --> 1:23:15.833
<i>I never saw it.</i>

1:23:15.916 --> 1:23:18.208
<i>I certainly never prescribed it</i>
<i>for your wife.</i>

1:23:18.833 --> 1:23:21.750
- Okay. Sorry to bother you.
- Tell him I went to three pharmacies--

1:23:21.833 --> 1:23:24.166
I'm never in control
of what I say to doctors.

1:23:26.375 --> 1:23:28.625
I will take the tablet
and have it analyzed

1:23:28.708 --> 1:23:31.583
by someone
at the chemistry department at the school.

1:23:31.666 --> 1:23:33.708
Unless you've already done that too?

1:23:34.416 --> 1:23:36.666
[chemist] It's not a tablet
in the old sense.

1:23:36.750 --> 1:23:40.041
The medication in Dylar
is encased in a polymer membrane.

1:23:40.125 --> 1:23:43.458
Water from your gastrointestinal tract
seeps through the membrane

1:23:43.541 --> 1:23:45.541
at a carefully controlled rate.

1:23:45.625 --> 1:23:46.916
What does the water do?

1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.583
It dissolves the medication
encased in the membrane.

1:23:49.666 --> 1:23:52.541
The medicine then passes out
of the polymer tablet

1:23:52.625 --> 1:23:54.375
through a single small hole.

1:23:54.458 --> 1:23:56.291
It took me a while to spot the hole.

1:23:56.375 --> 1:23:58.208
That's because it's laser-drilled.

1:23:58.291 --> 1:24:02.000
It's not only tiny
but stunningly precise in its dimensions.

1:24:02.083 --> 1:24:04.458
- Lasers? Polymers?
- [slurps]

1:24:04.541 --> 1:24:06.500
I'm not an expert in any of this, Jack,

1:24:06.583 --> 1:24:09.041
but I can tell you
it's a wonderful little system.

1:24:09.125 --> 1:24:12.000
- Ah, Twinkie!
- What's the point of all this precision?

1:24:12.083 --> 1:24:15.750
The drug is delivered at specified rates
over extended periods of time.

1:24:15.833 --> 1:24:17.416
The system is efficient.

1:24:17.500 --> 1:24:19.708
I'm impressed. I'm even dazzled.

1:24:20.583 --> 1:24:23.666
Now, tell me what this medication
is designed to do.

1:24:23.750 --> 1:24:25.541
What is Dylar?

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:27.541
- I don't know.
- Of course you know.

1:24:27.625 --> 1:24:30.625
- You're brilliant. Everyone says so.
- What else <i>can</i> they say?

1:24:30.708 --> 1:24:32.083
I do neurochemistry.

1:24:32.166 --> 1:24:33.666
No one knows what that is.

1:24:33.750 --> 1:24:35.375
All I can tell you for certain

1:24:35.458 --> 1:24:39.083
is the substance contained in Dylar
is some kind of psychopharmaceutical.

1:24:39.166 --> 1:24:42.875
It's probably designed to interact
with a distant part of the human cortex.

1:24:42.958 --> 1:24:46.250
I wish I knew more.
But I can tell you this.

1:24:46.958 --> 1:24:48.125
It's not on the market.

1:24:48.208 --> 1:24:51.125
I found it
in an ordinary prescription vial.

1:24:51.208 --> 1:24:52.875
I don't care where you found it.

1:24:53.583 --> 1:24:54.833
This is unknown.

1:25:23.291 --> 1:25:27.791
It's time for a major dialogue.
You know it, I know it.

1:25:27.875 --> 1:25:28.958
We found the Dylar.

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:31.000
What Dylar?

1:25:31.083 --> 1:25:33.750
Come on, Baba.
It was taped to the radiator cover.

1:25:34.375 --> 1:25:36.875
Why would I tape something
to the radiator cover?

1:25:36.958 --> 1:25:40.125
That's exactly what
Denise predicted you would say.

1:25:40.208 --> 1:25:43.375
- She's usually right.
- You'll tell me all about Dylar.

1:25:43.458 --> 1:25:45.833
If not for my sake,
then for your little girl's.

1:25:46.458 --> 1:25:48.833
She's been worried. Worried sick.

1:25:48.916 --> 1:25:51.208
Besides, you have no more room
to maneuver.

1:25:51.291 --> 1:25:52.708
We've backed you against the wall.

1:25:52.791 --> 1:25:55.375
I had one of the tablets
analyzed by an expert.

1:25:56.333 --> 1:25:58.500
Dylar is almost as ingenious

1:25:58.583 --> 1:26:01.958
as the microorganisms
that ate the billowing cloud.

1:26:03.541 --> 1:26:07.750
We know something else,
something crucially damaging to your case.

1:26:07.833 --> 1:26:10.750
We know Dylar is not available
to the general public.

1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:12.500
As you well know,

1:26:12.583 --> 1:26:14.833
I don't have the temperament
to hound people.

1:26:14.916 --> 1:26:17.000
But Denise is a different kind of person.

1:26:17.708 --> 1:26:21.291
If you don't tell me what I want to know,
I'll unleash your little girl.

1:26:21.375 --> 1:26:23.916
She'll come at you
with everything she has.

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.500
She'll hammer you right into the ground.

1:26:27.125 --> 1:26:28.750
You know I'm right, Babette.

1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:46.291
Just let me tell it in my own way.

1:26:46.958 --> 1:26:47.958
Take your time.

1:26:48.583 --> 1:26:49.875
We've got all day.

1:26:49.958 --> 1:26:52.250
I'll be right here
for as long as it takes.

1:26:58.416 --> 1:27:00.583
I don't know exactly when it started.

1:27:01.875 --> 1:27:03.791
Maybe a year and a half ago.

1:27:05.250 --> 1:27:07.458
I thought I was going through a phase.

1:27:08.250 --> 1:27:12.041
Some kind of watermark period in my life.

1:27:12.125 --> 1:27:14.500
"Landmark" or " watershed."

1:27:14.583 --> 1:27:18.291
A kind of settling-in, I thought.
Middle age. Something like that.

1:27:18.375 --> 1:27:22.041
The condition would go away,
and I'd forget about it, but it didn't.

1:27:22.125 --> 1:27:23.000
What condition?

1:27:23.083 --> 1:27:26.250
- Never mind that for now.
- I've never seen you like this.

1:27:26.333 --> 1:27:30.000
This is the whole point of Babette.
She is a joyous person.

1:27:30.083 --> 1:27:33.291
She doesn't succumb to gloom or self-pity.

1:27:33.375 --> 1:27:35.541
- Let me tell it, Jack.
- All right.

1:27:36.958 --> 1:27:40.083
You know how I am.
I think everything is correctable.

1:27:40.166 --> 1:27:43.500
Given the right attitude,
a person can change a harmful condition

1:27:43.583 --> 1:27:45.541
by reducing it to its simplest parts.

1:27:45.625 --> 1:27:50.291
I went to libraries and bookstores,
watched cable TV,

1:27:50.375 --> 1:27:54.166
made lists and diagrams,
talked to a holy Sikh man in Iron City.

1:27:54.250 --> 1:27:57.125
Even studied the occult,
hiding the books in the attic

1:27:57.208 --> 1:28:00.083
so you and Denise wouldn't find them
and wonder what was going on.

1:28:00.166 --> 1:28:02.291
All this without my knowing?

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:05.291
The whole point of Babette
is that she speaks to me,

1:28:05.958 --> 1:28:08.291
she reveals and confides.

1:28:08.375 --> 1:28:12.250
This is not a story
about your disappointment in my silence.

1:28:12.333 --> 1:28:15.333
The theme of this story
is my pain and my attempts to end it.

1:28:15.416 --> 1:28:16.375
Okay.

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:20.625
I did all this research,
but I was getting nowhere.

1:28:20.708 --> 1:28:22.708
The condition hung over my life.

1:28:23.458 --> 1:28:25.375
Then one day at the supermarket,

1:28:25.458 --> 1:28:27.833
I was reading a tabloid in line.

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:30.958
There was an ad.
Never mind exactly what it said.

1:28:31.041 --> 1:28:35.416
Volunteers wanted for secret research.
This is all you have to know.

1:28:36.083 --> 1:28:38.250
I answered the ad

1:28:38.333 --> 1:28:42.583
and was interviewed by a small firm
doing research in psychobiology.

1:28:43.416 --> 1:28:48.000
Let's call the company Gray Research,
although that's not the true name.

1:28:48.083 --> 1:28:50.750
Let's call my contact Mr. Gray.

1:28:50.833 --> 1:28:53.041
Mr. Gray is a composite.

1:28:53.125 --> 1:28:57.916
I was eventually in touch with three
or four or more people at the firm.

1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.666
One of those long, low, pale
brick buildings with electrified fencing

1:29:03.750 --> 1:29:05.583
and low-profile shrubbery.

1:29:05.666 --> 1:29:08.250
I never saw their headquarters.
Never mind why.

1:29:08.333 --> 1:29:11.708
The point is I took test after test.

1:29:11.791 --> 1:29:15.333
Emotional, psychological,
motor response, brain activity.

1:29:15.416 --> 1:29:18.708
Mr. Gray said there were three finalists
and I was one of them.

1:29:18.791 --> 1:29:20.416
Finalists for what?

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:23.291
We were to be test subjects

1:29:23.375 --> 1:29:28.291
in the development of a super-experimental
and top-secret drug. Code name:

1:29:29.583 --> 1:29:30.541
Dylar.

1:29:30.625 --> 1:29:31.833
Aha.

1:29:31.916 --> 1:29:35.416
He'd found a Dylar receptor
in the human brain

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:38.958
and was putting the finishing touches
on the tablet itself.

1:29:39.041 --> 1:29:42.375
I felt hopeful
for the first time in so long.

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:47.416
But there were many dangers
in running tests on humans.

1:29:47.500 --> 1:29:53.083
Among other things, it could cause death.
Or I could live but my brain could die.

1:29:53.166 --> 1:29:56.250
Or I could not distinguish
words from things,

1:29:56.333 --> 1:29:58.583
so that if someone said "speeding bullet,"

1:29:58.666 --> 1:30:03.666
I'd fall to the floor and take cover.
In the end, it just made me forget things.

1:30:03.750 --> 1:30:07.708
And they let you go ahead anyway,
a human test animal?

1:30:08.458 --> 1:30:09.541
No, they didn't.

1:30:10.833 --> 1:30:16.291
They finally said it was all too risky.
Legally, ethically, so forth.

1:30:16.375 --> 1:30:17.791
Well, that's good.

1:30:17.875 --> 1:30:19.000
No.

1:30:19.083 --> 1:30:21.000
I refused to accept this.

1:30:23.625 --> 1:30:26.208
I want you to try to understand
what happened next.

1:30:27.541 --> 1:30:30.666
If I'm going to tell you this story,
I have to include this aspect of it,

1:30:30.750 --> 1:30:33.416
this grubby little corner
of the human heart.

1:30:35.041 --> 1:30:37.125
You say Babette reveals and confides?

1:30:37.750 --> 1:30:39.750
- This is the point of Babette.
- Good.

1:30:40.750 --> 1:30:43.000
I will reveal and confide.

1:30:44.416 --> 1:30:46.541
But you don't want to know what happened.

1:30:47.958 --> 1:30:50.875
You think you do, but you don't.

1:30:52.958 --> 1:30:55.750
Mr. Gray and I made a private arrangement.

1:30:57.291 --> 1:30:59.666
We would conduct
the experiments on our own.

1:31:01.083 --> 1:31:02.958
I would be cured of my condition

1:31:03.041 --> 1:31:06.250
and he would be acclaimed
for a wonderful medical breakthrough.

1:31:06.333 --> 1:31:07.250
Okay.

1:31:10.958 --> 1:31:12.708
It involved an indiscretion.

1:31:13.666 --> 1:31:17.833
It… It was the only way I could get
Mr. Gray to let me use the drug.

1:31:18.541 --> 1:31:20.791
It was my last resort, my last hope.

1:31:21.916 --> 1:31:23.958
First, I'd offered him my mind.

1:31:24.041 --> 1:31:26.083
Now I offered my body.

1:31:31.333 --> 1:31:35.708
How do you offer your body
to a composite of three or more people?

1:31:37.416 --> 1:31:38.833
This is a compound person.

1:31:39.791 --> 1:31:42.041
Let's concentrate on the genitals.

1:31:43.125 --> 1:31:45.291
How many sets are we talking about?

1:31:45.916 --> 1:31:47.541
Just one person, Jack.

1:31:48.125 --> 1:31:51.333
A key person, the project manager.

1:31:51.416 --> 1:31:55.416
So we are no longer referring
to the Mr. Gray who is a composite.

1:31:55.500 --> 1:31:57.208
He is now one person.

1:32:00.375 --> 1:32:04.541
[hesitates] We went
to a grubby little motel room. [sobs]

1:32:07.791 --> 1:32:09.416
Never mind where or when.

1:32:11.083 --> 1:32:13.916
It had…
It had the TV up near the ceiling.

1:32:14.833 --> 1:32:17.750
This is all I remember.

1:32:17.833 --> 1:32:22.125
I was so ashamed,
I wore a ski mask to cover my face.

1:32:32.583 --> 1:32:36.833
You call this an indiscretion?
You traded sex for pills.

1:32:36.916 --> 1:32:38.916
- Jack…
- You walked barefoot

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.666
on the fire-retardant carpet.

1:32:41.750 --> 1:32:46.708
Mr. Gray put his car rental keys
on the dresser

1:32:46.791 --> 1:32:47.916
and he entered you.

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:52.416
Please don't use that term.
You know how I feel about that word.

1:32:52.500 --> 1:32:54.375
He effected what is called entry.

1:32:54.458 --> 1:32:57.041
[angrily] In other words,
he inserted himself inside you.

1:32:57.125 --> 1:32:59.291
No one was inside anyone.

1:32:59.375 --> 1:33:03.416
I did what I had to do. I was remote.

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:07.250
[hesitates] I was outside of myself.

1:33:07.333 --> 1:33:09.750
It was a capitalist transaction.

1:33:09.833 --> 1:33:13.208
You cherish your wife
who tells you everything.

1:33:13.291 --> 1:33:17.458
I am doing my best
to be that person. [sobbing]

1:33:17.541 --> 1:33:19.625
I'm only trying to understand.

1:33:21.583 --> 1:33:23.875
How many times did you go to this motel?

1:33:23.958 --> 1:33:27.166
More or less on a continuing basis
for some months.

1:33:27.250 --> 1:33:28.541
That was the agreement.

1:33:29.166 --> 1:33:30.166
Did…

1:33:32.541 --> 1:33:34.250
Did you enjoy having sex with him?

1:33:34.333 --> 1:33:36.458
I… I only…

1:33:37.333 --> 1:33:40.458
I only remember the TV
up near the ceiling, aimed down at us.

1:33:55.583 --> 1:33:57.208
Did he have a sense of humor?

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.750
I know women appreciate
men who can joke about sex.

1:34:00.833 --> 1:34:03.833
I can't, unfortunately. And after this,

1:34:03.916 --> 1:34:06.666
I don't think there's much chance
I'll be able to learn.

1:34:06.750 --> 1:34:10.708
[Babette] It's better
if you know him as Mr. Gray. That's all.

1:34:10.791 --> 1:34:13.875
He's not tall, short, young or old.

1:34:13.958 --> 1:34:17.458
He doesn't laugh or cry.
It's for your own good.

1:34:38.166 --> 1:34:40.250
No, you have to tell me who he is.

1:34:40.333 --> 1:34:43.541
No. How do I know you won't kill him?

1:34:43.625 --> 1:34:45.166
Because I'm not a killer.

1:34:45.250 --> 1:34:46.833
You're a man, Jack.

1:34:46.916 --> 1:34:50.166
We all know about men
and their insane jealous rage.

1:34:50.250 --> 1:34:53.416
- This is something men are very good at.
- I'm not good at that.

1:34:53.500 --> 1:34:57.750
I… I twirl garbage bags
and twist-tie them. I…

1:35:02.083 --> 1:35:03.250
Is this still going on?

1:35:03.333 --> 1:35:04.791
- No.
- Why not?

1:35:06.291 --> 1:35:08.750
Because the drug didn't work.

1:35:09.583 --> 1:35:12.583
At least on me.

1:35:18.291 --> 1:35:20.083
Maybe I should go.

1:35:23.208 --> 1:35:24.791
Get a hotel room or…

1:35:27.375 --> 1:35:28.375
I don't know.

1:35:33.250 --> 1:35:35.250
- I don't know.
- [Babette whimpers]

1:35:35.875 --> 1:35:37.875
[sniffling]

1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:54.500
[emotional music playing]

1:35:59.083 --> 1:36:00.291
[sobbing]

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:56.875
No.

1:36:58.000 --> 1:36:59.000
No.

1:37:03.750 --> 1:37:05.666
You've taken me this far,

1:37:06.916 --> 1:37:08.333
put me through this much.

1:37:09.333 --> 1:37:11.583
I have to know. What's the condition?

1:37:15.541 --> 1:37:17.208
I'm afraid to die.

1:37:18.708 --> 1:37:20.666
I'm afraid of my death.

1:37:20.750 --> 1:37:21.750
You?

1:37:24.208 --> 1:37:25.791
You're still young.

1:37:26.625 --> 1:37:29.291
You run up and down the stadium steps.

1:37:29.375 --> 1:37:31.958
This is not a reasonable fear.

1:37:32.041 --> 1:37:34.125
I… I just can't believe

1:37:34.208 --> 1:37:37.916
that we're all marching
towards nonexistence.

1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.041
All of us.

1:37:40.041 --> 1:37:43.041
It haunts me, Jack. It won't go away.

1:37:43.125 --> 1:37:45.500
Baba, everyone fears death.

1:37:45.583 --> 1:37:49.041
But Mr. Gray said
I was extra sensitive to it,

1:37:49.125 --> 1:37:54.083
that I fear it right up front.
That's why he was eager to use me.

1:37:54.166 --> 1:37:57.291
Baba, I'm the one in this family
who is obsessed by death.

1:37:57.375 --> 1:37:58.833
I have always been the one.

1:38:00.791 --> 1:38:02.041
[crying] I love you.

1:38:02.125 --> 1:38:07.583
I just fear death more than I love you.
And I really, really love you.

1:38:08.708 --> 1:38:11.750
There's something I promised myself
I wouldn't tell you.

1:38:13.583 --> 1:38:15.500
I'm tentatively scheduled to die.

1:38:16.833 --> 1:38:19.541
It won't happen tomorrow or the next day.

1:38:19.625 --> 1:38:21.000
But it's in the works.

1:38:21.958 --> 1:38:26.500
So we are no longer
talking about fear and floating terror.

1:38:26.583 --> 1:38:30.083
This is the hard and heavy thing,
the fact itself.

1:38:31.083 --> 1:38:32.791
Apparently, in the amount of time

1:38:32.875 --> 1:38:36.541
that it took me to walk
from my door to the gas station pump,

1:38:36.625 --> 1:38:39.666
I was exposed
to enough chemicals in the air that…

1:38:39.750 --> 1:38:43.125
[Alfonse] Imagining yourself dead
is one of the cheapest, sleaziest,

1:38:43.208 --> 1:38:45.583
most satisfying forms
of childish self-pity.

1:38:45.666 --> 1:38:48.541
How much pleasure did you take as a kid
in imagining yourself dead?

1:38:48.625 --> 1:38:51.666
I still imagine my death.
Whenever I'm upset about something,

1:38:51.750 --> 1:38:54.333
I imagine all my friends,
relatives, and colleagues,

1:38:54.416 --> 1:38:56.333
they're all gathered around my casket.

1:38:56.416 --> 1:38:59.333
They are very sorry
they weren't nicer to me while I lived.

1:38:59.416 --> 1:39:01.250
Children are very good at self-pity,

1:39:01.333 --> 1:39:03.458
which must mean
it's natural and important.

1:39:03.541 --> 1:39:06.625
There's something more
childish and satisfying than self-pity,

1:39:06.708 --> 1:39:09.833
something that explains why I try
to see myself dead regularly.

1:39:09.916 --> 1:39:11.416
[overlapping voices increasing in volume]

1:39:11.500 --> 1:39:15.000
[Murray] Death, disease, outer space.
It's all much clearer here.

1:39:16.708 --> 1:39:19.625
- [man on TV] <i>Start your breakfast…</i>
- [Murray] <i>…that's what it comes down to.</i>

1:39:19.708 --> 1:39:21.833
A person spends his life
saying goodbye to others.

1:39:21.916 --> 1:39:24.083
[Alfonse] But how does
he say goodbye to himself?

1:39:24.166 --> 1:39:27.208
<i>- </i>[German instructor] <i>Show me your tongue.</i>
- [Alfonse] We are awaiting your lecture<i>.</i>

1:39:27.291 --> 1:39:28.750
Panasonic.

1:39:28.833 --> 1:39:31.958
[woman on TV] <i>The kids are real fond</i>
<i>at my house of pepperoni,</i>

1:39:32.041 --> 1:39:34.625
<i>so I'm going to throw on</i>
<i>some pepperoni slices here…</i>

1:39:35.291 --> 1:39:37.083
<i>Cooked ham or sausage…</i>

1:39:37.166 --> 1:39:39.666
<i>This is a great way</i>
<i>to get rid of leftovers.</i>

1:39:39.750 --> 1:39:42.875
<i>Anything you have in the refrigerator</i>
<i>is fair game for a sandwich,</i>

1:39:42.958 --> 1:39:44.375
<i>at least it is at my house.</i>

1:39:44.458 --> 1:39:48.125
<i>I have some mozzarella cheese here,</i>
<i>we'll just load that up in the center.</i>
