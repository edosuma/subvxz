00:54.601 --> 00:56.106
Do you see anyone, Rover?

00:57.994 --> 00:59.082
All right, keep watching.

01:12.554 --> 01:14.186
If anyone comes this way,

01:14.218 --> 01:15.657
you let me know, right?

01:25.481 --> 01:26.281
Hmm?

01:32.969 --> 01:33.578
Rover?

01:39.977 --> 01:40.873
Okay, one last time.

01:40.905 --> 01:42.186
Baby bottle?

01:42.218 --> 01:43.946
Never
in the microwave.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.641
And once the milk's heated up?

01:45.673 --> 01:48.457
Test it with a drop on
the inside of the wrist.

01:48.489 --> 01:49.706
If she gets an ear ache?

01:49.738 --> 01:51.241
Three drops of
this in each ear.

01:51.272 --> 01:52.714
If she
doesn't want to eat?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.057
Don't force her.

01:55.466 --> 01:57.386
Uh, do force her?

01:58.538 --> 02:01.354
Oh, right, feed her from
her favorite bunny dish!

02:01.386 --> 02:02.857
It never fails.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.009
She eats the food
so that she can see

02:04.042 --> 02:04.937
the bunnies underneath.

02:04.969 --> 02:05.929
Simple psychology.

02:08.489 --> 02:09.449
Your taxi.

02:09.481 --> 02:11.018
Felix, come on!

02:11.050 --> 02:12.010
Just a minute!

02:12.041 --> 02:13.738
If the pacifier's lost,

02:13.770 --> 02:15.337
same shape, same color.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.457
She'll never know
the difference.

02:16.489 --> 02:17.738
Simple psychology.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.337
If anything comes
up, day or night,

02:19.369 --> 02:20.458
send me a text.

02:21.929 --> 02:23.274
Oh, I don't wanna leave.

02:23.306 --> 02:25.769
Going on a tropical
cruise was Mom's idea!

02:25.801 --> 02:27.210
Listen, Marlene.

02:27.242 --> 02:29.258
You've been looking after
your family by yourself

02:29.290 --> 02:30.793
for two years.

02:30.825 --> 02:32.552
You need a break!

02:32.585 --> 02:34.377
Now get in that taxi

02:34.409 --> 02:36.329
and do something for yourself!

02:36.361 --> 02:38.377
Don't worry, everything
will be fine.

02:47.402 --> 02:48.266
You'll behave yourself,

02:48.298 --> 02:49.322
- right?
- Mom!

02:49.354 --> 02:50.857
And listen to Max's parents?

02:50.889 --> 02:52.042
And be careful when
you reach Montreal?

02:52.074 --> 02:53.577
And make sure
to look both ways

02:53.609 --> 02:54.889
before crossing the street.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.449
I love you.

02:57.481 --> 02:58.441
I love you too, Mom.

03:00.425 --> 03:01.706
Ha.

03:01.738 --> 03:03.818
Taxi's waiting
for you, Marlene.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.121
Oh, and don't forget
the flash cards!

03:06.152 --> 03:07.530
I won't.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.065
If little Mia hasn't
spoken her first words

03:09.097 --> 03:11.081
by summer's end, I'm
calling a psychologist.

03:12.202 --> 03:13.832
And if any calls come
in about the house,

03:13.865 --> 03:15.721
be sure to take down,
names, phone numbers,

03:15.752 --> 03:17.098
email addresses,
social media handles.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.592
Marlene, get out of here!

03:22.121 --> 03:23.529
Mommy loves you both!

03:23.561 --> 03:24.810
Marlene!

03:24.842 --> 03:26.281
Okay,
okay, I'm leaving.

03:28.426 --> 03:29.770
See you soon!

03:29.801 --> 03:31.049
Everything will be fine.

03:34.025 --> 03:34.889
Bye!

03:38.889 --> 03:39.881
No, no, no.

03:41.672 --> 03:44.585
Oh!

03:44.617 --> 03:45.385
Ow!

03:47.081 --> 03:49.449
Where is the volume
control on this kid?

03:49.481 --> 03:50.954
Ah!

03:52.810 --> 03:54.249
And that takes care of that.

03:55.177 --> 03:56.169
Oh, thanks, Felix.

03:56.201 --> 03:57.992
I'm going to Max's house.

03:58.025 --> 03:59.465
You'll be back for supper?

03:59.498 --> 04:02.089
Actually, I'm sleeping over.

04:02.122 --> 04:04.298
His parents want to get
an early start tomorrow.

04:04.330 --> 04:07.529
Mwah, bye, little sister.

04:07.561 --> 04:08.713
Be a good girl with Annie.

04:09.577 --> 04:10.698
See you tomorrow.

04:12.746 --> 04:14.377
Have a nice week, Annie!

04:14.409 --> 04:15.433
You too!

04:15.466 --> 04:18.152
Don't forget to stay in touch.

04:55.818 --> 04:57.194
Hey, you!

04:57.226 --> 04:58.922
I got one, I got one!

05:34.378 --> 05:35.912
Tom?

05:35.945 --> 05:37.865
If you wanna
talk, come upstairs!

05:45.962 --> 05:48.265
Well played, Squat.

05:53.129 --> 05:54.602
Tom!

05:54.634 --> 05:56.618
Ah, in a rush as usual.

05:58.153 --> 06:00.169
At my age, a person's happiest

06:00.202 --> 06:02.378
when time passes slowly.

06:02.410 --> 06:04.009
That's why my
favorite thing to do

06:04.042 --> 06:07.496
is sit quietly and
play solitaire.

06:07.529 --> 06:08.650
You should give it a try.

06:08.682 --> 06:09.512
Good news.

06:09.546 --> 06:10.698
My mum just left.

06:10.729 --> 06:12.010
That's great.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.633
I'm sure it'll do
her a world of good.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.489
And you too, I'm guessing.

06:16.522 --> 06:18.089
So, when do we leave?

06:20.298 --> 06:24.169
You know, this is my 1000th
solitaire game of the year.

06:25.354 --> 06:26.441
Yeah?

06:26.474 --> 06:29.162
Yes, indeed, 1000.

06:29.194 --> 06:31.274
I'd like the game to be perfect.

06:31.305 --> 06:32.809
It's just that,

06:32.842 --> 06:34.376
if we're gonna go all
the way over there

06:34.409 --> 06:36.361
and come back without
my mum finding out,

06:36.393 --> 06:38.313
we really need to leave
as soon as we can.

06:38.346 --> 06:40.136
I've thought it over.

06:40.169 --> 06:42.056
And I decided it's a bad idea.

06:42.089 --> 06:43.690
A bad idea?

06:43.721 --> 06:44.489
What do you mean?

06:44.522 --> 06:46.026
Too dangerous.

06:46.057 --> 06:49.002
The wind off the island
is always changing.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.665
The waves are unpredictable.

06:52.009 --> 06:54.858
And when you aren't struggling
against the wind and waves,

06:54.889 --> 06:57.833
it's the reefs
cloaked in thick fog.

06:57.866 --> 07:00.393
This is the first
time in two years

07:00.426 --> 07:01.706
that my mother's left the house.

07:01.738 --> 07:03.337
You promised!

07:03.370 --> 07:05.322
We'd go to the island as
soon as we had the chance!

07:05.353 --> 07:09.066
As I recall, I
said "We'll see."

07:09.097 --> 07:12.362
That's not the same thing
as making a promise.

07:12.394 --> 07:14.890
Whenever my dad used
to say "We'll see",

07:14.922 --> 07:16.842
what he really meant was yes.

07:16.873 --> 07:18.536
None of that now.

07:18.569 --> 07:19.145
What?

07:19.178 --> 07:19.786
That.

07:22.121 --> 07:24.393
When your father went missing,

07:24.426 --> 07:26.762
the Coast Guard did all
they could to find him.

07:28.233 --> 07:30.025
I should know, I
was there to help.

07:31.689 --> 07:33.930
Two years have
passed since then.

07:33.961 --> 07:36.906
Two years of vessels
plying these waters.

07:37.993 --> 07:39.882
Seems to me, if
there was any chance

07:39.913 --> 07:40.681
that your father was still-

07:42.601 --> 07:45.481
If he were out there,

07:45.513 --> 07:48.682
don't you think someone would
have spotted him by now?

07:48.713 --> 07:50.377
So we're not going?

07:57.609 --> 07:59.113
If you don't mind,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.394
I'd like to finish
my game of solitaire.

08:27.305 --> 08:28.202
Whoah!

08:28.234 --> 08:29.929
So, that's the plan.

08:29.962 --> 08:32.553
I leave from here
at dawn tomorrow,

08:32.586 --> 08:34.666
I arrive there two days later.

08:34.697 --> 08:35.496
Okay.

08:36.905 --> 08:37.738
Ow!

08:37.769 --> 08:38.506
Listen up, Max!

08:38.537 --> 08:39.529
No!

08:39.562 --> 08:40.841
Forget the game for a second.

08:40.874 --> 08:42.090
Make it fast, will you?

08:42.121 --> 08:43.113
The mutants are closing in.

08:43.145 --> 08:45.257
Max, this is important.

08:45.289 --> 08:46.473
Once I'm on the island,

08:46.505 --> 08:48.810
I'll have three
days to find my dad.

08:48.841 --> 08:50.249
Uh huh.

08:50.282 --> 08:52.073
Then it'll take another
three days to get back,

08:52.106 --> 08:54.026
because the currents
will be against me.

08:54.058 --> 08:56.746
That makes eight days in all.

08:56.777 --> 08:58.410
My mother's gone for 10.

08:58.441 --> 09:00.522
That's just enough time
to make the round trip.

09:00.553 --> 09:01.929
Great.

09:01.961 --> 09:03.433
Can I have the
controller back now?

09:03.466 --> 09:04.489
Hang on.

09:04.522 --> 09:06.057
Then there's our cover story.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.329
Cover story?

09:08.362 --> 09:09.897
My mother and my
aunt think I'm gonna be

09:09.930 --> 09:11.433
in Montreal with you
and your parents.

09:11.465 --> 09:13.897
Yeah, yeah, I remember
all that, Felix.

09:13.930 --> 09:17.258
While I'm away, you've
gotta make absolutely sure

09:17.289 --> 09:19.209
my aunt doesn't see you, right?

09:19.241 --> 09:20.490
Right.

09:20.521 --> 09:22.633
Anything you say.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.537
Max!

09:26.569 --> 09:28.137
That means you're absolutely

09:30.442 --> 09:32.522
not allowed to leave the house.

09:32.553 --> 09:34.217
Sure thing.

09:34.249 --> 09:36.810
Listen, if my mum finds
out I'm not in Montreal,

09:36.841 --> 09:38.857
but that I've actually
gone off on a boat

09:38.890 --> 09:40.202
to search for my dad,

09:40.233 --> 09:42.537
Then it's game over
for you, I get it.

09:42.570 --> 09:44.490
Now can I have the
controller please?

09:46.473 --> 09:49.353
Ah, Ah!

10:03.017 --> 10:04.746
Jump in, Rover.

10:14.025 --> 10:14.793
Yoohoo!

10:41.449 --> 10:42.794
Don't worry, Rover.

10:42.825 --> 10:43.625
Whoah!

10:47.498 --> 10:49.833
Oh, great, the engine's dead.

10:52.681 --> 10:53.545
Ah!

10:55.690 --> 10:56.906
Hang on, Rover!

10:58.505 --> 10:59.305
Oh!

11:03.337 --> 11:04.649
Look out!

11:05.865 --> 11:08.585
Oh no!

11:19.690 --> 11:20.457
Rover!

11:22.889 --> 11:23.657
Rover!

11:28.265 --> 11:30.025
Rover, stay where you are.

11:40.873 --> 11:42.089
We're done for.

11:44.521 --> 11:47.081
Huh?

11:47.114 --> 11:47.913
Hey!

11:50.410 --> 11:51.497
Haha, we're safe!

11:54.185 --> 11:54.985
Hmm.

12:01.449 --> 12:03.049
Now I'll never find him.

12:04.202 --> 12:06.601
My little sister will
never meet her father.

12:06.633 --> 12:09.513
And my dad will never learn
that he has a daughter.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.114
And let's hope your
mother never learns

12:11.146 --> 12:13.353
that his son was foolish enough

12:13.385 --> 12:15.337
to venture out in the open ocean

12:15.370 --> 12:17.097
in a dinghy no bigger
than a bathtub!

12:24.362 --> 12:26.857
What's wrong with young
people these days?

12:26.890 --> 12:29.705
Why can't you seem to
get it through your heads

12:29.737 --> 12:32.009
that no means no?

12:33.449 --> 12:35.369
It's not so hard to understand.

12:35.401 --> 12:40.137
When a grownup says no,
that's it, end of story.

12:49.865 --> 12:51.721
Oh, all right.

12:52.713 --> 12:53.929
Listen up, my boy.

12:53.961 --> 12:55.497
Tomorrow we're
gonna get in my boat

12:55.529 --> 12:58.377
and sail out to that
confounded island.

12:58.409 --> 12:58.985
We are?!

13:01.066 --> 13:02.506
- On two conditions.
- Yeah?

13:02.537 --> 13:04.617
First, after we
search the place,

13:04.649 --> 13:05.642
Uh huh?

13:05.673 --> 13:07.113
That'll be the end of it.

13:07.145 --> 13:09.097
You won't bring up
the matter again.

13:09.130 --> 13:10.442
I promise.

13:10.473 --> 13:14.697
And second, you'll
cut that out right now.

13:14.729 --> 13:15.657
Mmm.

13:18.314 --> 13:19.881
Times sure have changed.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.970
When I was your
age, a young fellow

13:25.002 --> 13:27.785
would never let himself be
seen with tears in his eyes.

13:27.818 --> 13:29.546
Do you hear what
I'm saying, my boy?

14:01.450 --> 14:02.249
Tom!

14:03.913 --> 14:04.713
I'm ready!

14:06.026 --> 14:08.073
No useless stuff
in that knapsack?

14:08.106 --> 14:09.641
No.

14:09.673 --> 14:10.473
Mmm.

14:53.705 --> 14:55.690
Hang on, Dad, I'm coming.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.833
Settle down, Squat.

15:13.865 --> 15:14.953
Hey!

15:14.985 --> 15:16.617
What's gotten into you?

15:18.154 --> 15:20.649
That's just an old barrel.

15:20.681 --> 15:21.481
Hmm.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.185
What on earth
is he doing here?

15:30.217 --> 15:31.017
Rover?

15:32.169 --> 15:34.057
He must have followed me.

15:34.089 --> 15:36.458
Oh, sure, he must
have followed you.

15:36.490 --> 15:38.346
Let me tell you something.

15:38.378 --> 15:41.162
A cat is useless
aboard a sailboat.

15:41.194 --> 15:44.489
So, if your feline friend
tumbles in the water,

15:44.521 --> 15:46.377
don't count on me
to fish him out.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.609
Not every single thing in life

15:49.641 --> 15:51.241
has to be useful, you know?

15:51.273 --> 15:52.137
Hmm.

15:55.626 --> 15:58.538
Well I guess that explains
all the junk you brought.

15:58.570 --> 16:00.298
Life at sea isn't the same

16:00.330 --> 16:02.346
as life at shore, Felix.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.641
On land, you can have all
the useful stuff you like.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.729
But at sea,

16:06.761 --> 16:10.537
oh, oh, ow ow!

16:10.569 --> 16:12.938
Ow!

16:17.770 --> 16:19.977
You can only bring
along what's necessary.

16:22.602 --> 16:24.937
And who ever heard of
a cat that loves bones?

16:26.314 --> 16:27.753
Hmm?

16:43.113 --> 16:43.722
Oh.

16:44.650 --> 16:45.450
Jack.

17:00.746 --> 17:04.746
Seaweed bean
stew, my specialty.

17:04.778 --> 17:06.057
Give it a try, my boy.

17:07.145 --> 17:09.001
Do you think the
legends are true?

17:09.032 --> 17:11.913
Is there a hidden treasure
on Dark Shadow Island?

17:11.944 --> 17:14.441
I used
to tell your father

17:14.473 --> 17:16.202
about those legends
when I was teaching him

17:16.233 --> 17:18.218
how to handle a boat.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.617
He wasn't much older
than you back then.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.800
But are they true?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.945
They're just old
sailors' tales.

17:23.978 --> 17:26.217
You shouldn't set too
much store by them.

17:26.249 --> 17:29.161
What about the story of
the spider called Morgaa

17:29.192 --> 17:30.666
who watches over the treasure?

17:30.698 --> 17:32.426
Your father believed it.

17:32.458 --> 17:35.242
The day he left, he had more
on his mind than fishing.

17:36.362 --> 17:37.801
He was plotting to
go to the island

17:37.832 --> 17:39.338
and search for the treasure.

17:40.712 --> 17:42.026
When a man's in trouble,

17:42.058 --> 17:44.521
he does things he
wouldn't normally do.

17:45.577 --> 17:46.922
What do you mean trouble?

17:46.954 --> 17:48.265
Money trouble.

17:50.377 --> 17:52.232
I shouldn't be talking
about these things.

17:52.265 --> 17:54.281
My dad was
worried about money?

17:54.313 --> 17:56.169
When the fish
plant closed down

17:56.201 --> 17:58.346
a lot of people lost
their livelihoods.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.322
Your father tried to
convince your mother

18:01.354 --> 18:03.242
that the plant would
reopen someday.

18:04.873 --> 18:07.592
But as time went by, your
mother started arguing

18:07.625 --> 18:10.154
that the family should
move to the mainland.

18:10.186 --> 18:11.689
I know.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.289
She's always saying
that as soon as she gets

18:13.321 --> 18:15.433
a decent offer on the
house, she'll sell it.

18:17.257 --> 18:18.089
Hey, what's going on?

18:21.578 --> 18:22.378
Rover!

18:38.954 --> 18:39.754
Hmm.

19:10.666 --> 19:11.465
Huh?

19:16.009 --> 19:16.809
Hmm.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.810
Oh, my poor boy.

19:33.032 --> 19:34.474
I hope you find him too.

19:43.529 --> 19:45.481
Ladies
and gentlemen,

19:45.512 --> 19:47.626
our beloved leader, Morgaa!

19:53.418 --> 19:55.754
My fellow Morgaalians.

19:55.786 --> 19:57.226
Love you Morgaa!

19:57.258 --> 19:58.921
Morgaa!

19:58.952 --> 20:01.098
Yeah, Morgaa!

20:03.721 --> 20:05.962
Thank you, dear
friends, thank you.

20:07.241 --> 20:10.858
Since we created Forever City,

20:10.890 --> 20:14.249
we've always been
open to newcomers

20:14.281 --> 20:17.514
as long as they were
people of quality.

20:17.546 --> 20:19.625
People like you.

20:21.418 --> 20:25.226
This evening, we welcome
a wonderful new resident.

20:26.345 --> 20:30.793
Famous multi-billionaire
Bruce Bagwell

20:32.105 --> 20:33.385
and his family.

20:46.249 --> 20:48.776
You see, if you turn
the wheel like this,

20:48.809 --> 20:50.825
you can change the
vessel's course.

20:50.857 --> 20:51.721
You wanna try it?

20:51.752 --> 20:52.616
Me?

20:52.649 --> 20:53.994
Yes, you.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.049
You see anyone else around?

20:55.082 --> 20:58.794
Oh, wow, awesome!

20:58.826 --> 21:02.890
Now this shows us how fast
the boat's going in knots.

21:02.921 --> 21:04.265
And this is the fuel gauge.

21:04.297 --> 21:05.705
It shows us how
much we have left.

21:07.081 --> 21:10.057
And this control lever makes
us go forward or backward.

21:10.090 --> 21:12.010
Didn't your dad show
you these things?

21:12.042 --> 21:14.089
Nah, mum didn't want him to.

21:14.122 --> 21:15.274
She thought I was too young.

21:18.154 --> 21:19.818
Uh-oh.

21:19.849 --> 21:21.416
That's not good.

21:26.954 --> 21:28.554
A boat.

21:32.585 --> 21:34.474
A house!

21:34.505 --> 21:35.306
Pfft.

21:37.514 --> 21:40.394
Parliamentary debate.

21:42.026 --> 21:43.114
Nope, that didn't work.

21:44.650 --> 21:46.858
Maybe you're more
spatial than verbal.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.457
Let's see.

21:49.289 --> 21:49.865
Oh!

21:49.898 --> 21:50.954
Oh brother.

21:54.282 --> 21:55.529
Hello?

21:55.562 --> 21:57.418
It's
me, how are things?

21:57.449 --> 21:59.498
Oh, just fine.

21:59.530 --> 22:00.937
Any news from Felix?

22:00.970 --> 22:02.282
No, you?

22:02.314 --> 22:03.882
I called Max's
parents several times

22:03.913 --> 22:05.225
but there was no answer.

22:05.258 --> 22:07.114
And wouldn't you know
it, no voice mail.

22:07.145 --> 22:08.617
I guess they're busy seeing

22:08.650 --> 22:10.409
all the great
sights in Montreal.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.352
How's little Mia?

22:13.386 --> 22:14.921
Nothing new to report.

22:14.954 --> 22:16.201
Things are great.

22:16.232 --> 22:17.513
Okay.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.081
Still, I'd feel happier
if Felix got in touch.

22:19.112 --> 22:21.993
Relax Marlene, stop worrying.

22:22.026 --> 22:25.801
Right now, they're probably
having a grand time

22:25.833 --> 22:27.274
at the amusement park.

22:34.409 --> 22:35.978
It's getting too dangerous!

22:36.010 --> 22:37.961
Go get your life
jacket in the cabin!

22:37.994 --> 22:38.890
All right!

22:38.921 --> 22:40.266
I'll take the wheel.

22:40.297 --> 22:41.353
Whoah!

22:41.386 --> 22:42.282
Gotcha!

22:42.313 --> 22:43.081
Tom!

22:43.113 --> 22:44.073
Hang on!

22:44.106 --> 22:44.969
I'm trying!

22:50.026 --> 22:50.986
Thanks!

22:51.018 --> 22:52.616
You can thank me later.

22:52.649 --> 22:54.314
Go get your life jacket.

22:54.345 --> 22:55.657
Okay!

23:01.001 --> 23:02.377
Don't you worry.

23:02.410 --> 23:03.337
Tom will get us out of this.

23:03.370 --> 23:04.169
Whoah!

23:08.522 --> 23:09.322
Whoah!

23:11.146 --> 23:13.066
You all right, my boy?

23:13.098 --> 23:14.696
Never felt better.

23:26.921 --> 23:28.362
No one is injured?

23:28.393 --> 23:29.418
No, no one!

23:39.434 --> 23:41.033
What the?

23:41.066 --> 23:45.546
What's going on here?

23:45.577 --> 23:47.626
Are we at the reefs already?

23:49.386 --> 23:50.185
Oh.

23:52.362 --> 23:53.161
Squat!

23:54.153 --> 23:54.729
Come here!

23:57.001 --> 23:59.529
I need you in the
bow to guide us.

24:09.769 --> 24:10.793
Look to port!

24:15.529 --> 24:16.586
To starboard!

24:26.953 --> 24:27.753
Oh no.

24:29.770 --> 24:31.018
Hang on, everyone!

24:51.434 --> 24:53.929
Your cat may have
lost his bone, my boy.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.002
But I've lost my entire boat.

24:58.473 --> 24:59.626
And since when do cats howl?

25:00.713 --> 25:02.506
That's one weird
pet you have, Felix.

25:03.497 --> 25:05.130
Tom, straight ahead!

25:06.409 --> 25:07.369
There it is.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.569
Dark Shadow Island.

25:47.593 --> 25:49.321
Let's stop here
and get some rest.

25:52.361 --> 25:53.130
Oh!

25:54.538 --> 25:55.337
Tom?

25:56.233 --> 25:57.130
Is that you?

25:58.601 --> 25:59.850
Have you been here before?

26:00.937 --> 26:03.817
Last century, yes.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.610
Who's MC?

26:09.513 --> 26:11.049
Let's set up camp
then we'll talk.

26:20.618 --> 26:22.921
I was 25 years old.

26:22.953 --> 26:25.770
Like your father, I
was hoping to find

26:25.801 --> 26:27.177
the treasure of Morgaa.

26:29.673 --> 26:31.721
I was a young fool.

26:31.753 --> 26:34.922
I had come to the island
with my girlfriend.

26:34.953 --> 26:36.809
Her name was Madeleine.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.849
All I wanted to do
was impress her.

26:41.321 --> 26:45.545
But one morning, she
disappeared, just like that.

26:46.377 --> 26:48.202
She had vanished into thin air.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.217
You were never
able to find her?

26:50.249 --> 26:54.153
I came back three
times with rescue teams.

26:54.185 --> 26:56.490
We looked everywhere, nothing.

26:57.641 --> 27:01.290
She must have fallen off
a cliff into the ocean.

27:01.321 --> 27:05.097
Is that why you didn't
wanna return to the island?

27:05.130 --> 27:06.346
Hmm.

27:06.377 --> 27:07.721
It's late.

27:07.754 --> 27:08.970
Let's get some shuteye.

27:22.857 --> 27:25.609
I trust you found
your latte enjoyable.

27:25.642 --> 27:28.170
Delicious.

27:28.201 --> 27:29.193
Good.

27:29.225 --> 27:30.698
Now let's get down to business.

27:33.513 --> 27:35.593
Our brand new city.

27:35.626 --> 27:39.753
150 square
kilometers of paradise.

27:39.785 --> 27:41.673
Oh, it's heaven on earth!

27:41.705 --> 27:44.906
The only heaven is a
tax haven.

27:44.937 --> 27:46.473
Yai!

27:46.505 --> 27:48.425
But moving our people
and possessions there

27:48.457 --> 27:50.921
will be complicated.

27:50.954 --> 27:52.457
Let's keep it simple.

27:52.489 --> 27:55.210
Bring what we need
and dynamite the rest.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.033
Dynamite it?

27:57.065 --> 27:58.377
There are no problems in life

27:58.409 --> 28:00.905
that explosives can't solve.

28:02.249 --> 28:04.202
Still, the move
will cost a fortune.

28:05.321 --> 28:07.241
As I've told Morgaa,
I've reached an age

28:07.274 --> 28:09.545
where I'm ready to
invest all my wealth

28:09.577 --> 28:12.457
in a visionary scheme.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.882
This project of yours
definitely fits the bill.

28:15.914 --> 28:17.417
Don't worry about the cost.

28:17.449 --> 28:20.522
Whatever it is, I'll cover it.

28:20.553 --> 28:23.273
Since we're on the subject
of money, my dear Bruce,

28:23.306 --> 28:25.769
I was wondering
when can we expect

28:25.801 --> 28:27.242
to receive your advance payment.

28:27.273 --> 28:30.537
You'll get the money
after I've transformed.

28:31.690 --> 28:33.641
But you see,
residents are expected

28:33.673 --> 28:37.002
to make their payment
before being transformed.

28:37.034 --> 28:38.729
I hope you understand.

28:38.762 --> 28:42.537
When I do
a business deal, Morgaa,

28:42.569 --> 28:45.353
it's just like going
to a restaurant.

28:45.386 --> 28:48.905
I eat the meal first,
then I pay the money.

28:48.937 --> 28:51.273
I hope you understand.

29:26.729 --> 29:27.593
Rover.

29:27.626 --> 29:28.842
Hey, come back here!

29:37.033 --> 29:38.474
Haha!

29:38.506 --> 29:41.577
72 hours straight and
Mighty Max is undefeated!

29:41.609 --> 29:42.601
Oh no!

29:42.633 --> 29:43.465
No, no, no, no!

29:45.673 --> 29:46.473
What?

29:47.913 --> 29:48.713
No!

29:53.353 --> 29:55.177
That was the last one.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.233
What do I do?

29:59.113 --> 30:01.386
Bagwell is even tougher
than I'd supposed.

30:01.418 --> 30:02.953
Do you really think it's wise

30:02.985 --> 30:06.218
to transform him before
he pays us the money?

30:06.250 --> 30:08.489
What choice have I got, Claus?

30:08.521 --> 30:10.505
Need I remind you of
our financial situation

30:10.537 --> 30:12.393
or the shape this place is in?

30:12.425 --> 30:14.313
But Bagwell is famous
for being crooked.

30:14.345 --> 30:16.297
He grew rich using
shady connections

30:16.330 --> 30:17.770
to acquire prime real estate

30:17.802 --> 30:19.529
then demolishing
heritage buildings

30:19.562 --> 30:21.546
and putting up
big office towers!

30:21.578 --> 30:25.801
He's also suspected
of tax fraud!

30:25.833 --> 30:27.146
Nobody's perfect.

30:27.177 --> 30:29.961
Then there's his bogus
cosmetics business.

30:29.993 --> 30:32.713
His company manufactures
high priced wrinkle cream

30:32.745 --> 30:34.505
for 10 year olds!

30:34.537 --> 30:36.010
Okay, I get it.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.994
He's not the world's
most honest guy,

30:38.026 --> 30:41.290
but you left out
his finest quality.

30:41.321 --> 30:42.473
The man's a billionaire.

30:46.666 --> 30:47.881
Haha!

30:47.913 --> 30:49.289
Look out, aliens!

30:49.321 --> 30:50.890
Mighty Max is back!

30:50.921 --> 30:51.721
Max?

30:52.810 --> 30:54.026
What the, you?

30:54.057 --> 30:55.210
You're back so soon?

30:57.098 --> 31:00.457
Well, the truth is,
I never actually left.

31:00.490 --> 31:02.409
What do you mean
you never left?

31:02.441 --> 31:04.521
Where's Felix?

31:04.553 --> 31:05.706
Felix?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.466
Oh, he's not here.

31:07.497 --> 31:09.001
He left.

31:09.033 --> 31:09.929
He went to Montreal
with your parents

31:09.961 --> 31:11.177
while you stayed here?

31:11.209 --> 31:12.554
No, not Montreal.

31:12.586 --> 31:14.921
He sailed away on a
boat to find his dad.

31:14.953 --> 31:15.753
In a boat?

31:15.785 --> 31:17.129
What boat?

31:17.162 --> 31:18.889
Well, first he tried
an inflatable dinghy

31:18.921 --> 31:21.034
but that was a total washout.

31:21.066 --> 31:22.857
So then he went to
the old man's boat.

31:22.889 --> 31:25.545
I mean Tom who
lives in the lighthouse.

31:25.577 --> 31:26.890
No, no, no, no, no!

31:35.017 --> 31:35.849
Rover!

31:37.193 --> 31:38.186
Rover!

31:38.217 --> 31:39.242
Oh, ow, ow!

31:40.073 --> 31:40.969
Oh, oh, oh!

31:43.721 --> 31:46.986
70 years old,
chasing a crazy cat

31:47.018 --> 31:48.681
all over a desert island.

31:48.713 --> 31:51.241
Where did I go wrong?

32:00.169 --> 32:00.969
Rover!

32:03.721 --> 32:04.649
Rover!

32:07.689 --> 32:08.489
No!

32:11.050 --> 32:13.353
Money, money, money.

32:13.385 --> 32:15.786
Oh.

32:24.298 --> 32:25.097
Hmm.

32:38.377 --> 32:39.305
Mhmm.

32:39.337 --> 32:40.297
Oh!

32:59.433 --> 33:00.329
Excellent.

33:20.201 --> 33:21.161
Rover!

33:21.194 --> 33:23.081
Where are you?

33:23.114 --> 33:25.289
We gonna stay here all day?

33:25.321 --> 33:27.209
Rover, this isn't funny!

33:27.241 --> 33:29.129
Come on out right now!

33:29.161 --> 33:32.201
In my experience,
cats aren't very good

33:32.233 --> 33:33.674
at following orders, Felix.

33:33.706 --> 33:35.977
Rover is no ordinary cat.

33:36.009 --> 33:37.290
So I've noticed.

33:37.322 --> 33:39.785
Was his father a fox terrier?

33:39.817 --> 33:41.609
Rover, here boy!

33:42.761 --> 33:43.721
Hey Marlene.

33:43.753 --> 33:45.098
It's me.

33:45.130 --> 33:47.050
Can you get back to me
as soon as possible?

33:48.329 --> 33:50.954
Everything's great,
nothing to worry about.

33:50.986 --> 33:51.786
Bye.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.072
Oh, give me a break, kid.

34:00.426 --> 34:01.386
Oh, brother.

34:03.114 --> 34:04.106
Oh!

34:04.138 --> 34:06.281
Oh, oh, oh, the bunny dish.

34:08.266 --> 34:09.802
Where did I put it?

34:14.440 --> 34:16.168
The pacifier!

34:16.201 --> 34:17.161
Where is it?

34:22.089 --> 34:22.920
Oh yes!

34:26.792 --> 34:28.297
Hang on, Mia!

34:30.857 --> 34:31.978
Just a minute.

34:32.777 --> 34:33.641
I'm coming!

34:39.626 --> 34:40.585
Oh!

34:40.618 --> 34:43.530
The bunny dish!

34:43.562 --> 34:45.257
I said just a minute!

34:47.911 --> 34:50.985
Morgaa,
Morgaa, Morgaa, Morgaa!

34:51.817 --> 34:53.002
Morgaa, Morgaa!

34:54.601 --> 34:56.521
Thank you, dear friends.

34:57.673 --> 34:59.914
Today, we join
together to celebrate

34:59.945 --> 35:02.762
the transformation of
our newest Morgaalian,

35:03.754 --> 35:08.394
world famous businessman
Bruce Bagwell!

35:10.505 --> 35:11.912
With his support,

35:11.945 --> 35:15.210
our nation will
grow and prosper.

35:15.242 --> 35:18.793
In time, we'll become
the most admired society

35:18.826 --> 35:22.376
that man, or should I say woman,

35:22.409 --> 35:25.417
has ever created on earth.

35:33.322 --> 35:37.001
Now, let's find
our newest jackpot,

35:37.033 --> 35:38.761
I mean, citizen.

35:42.122 --> 35:45.577
Could he be behind
door number one?

35:50.602 --> 35:51.818
Aw.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.289
Aw.

35:53.321 --> 35:55.562
How about door number two?

36:00.073 --> 36:01.194
Mmm mmm.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.857
Aw.

36:02.889 --> 36:06.697
Then he must be behind
door number three.

36:09.098 --> 36:09.898
Huh, what?

36:16.232 --> 36:16.810
Dad!

36:16.841 --> 36:18.025
Oh, Bruce.

36:28.712 --> 36:31.722
I don't like being shut in, so

36:31.753 --> 36:34.441
I decided to make
my own entrance.

36:41.482 --> 36:43.529
Rover, I'm serious!

36:43.562 --> 36:45.097
Come out or else!

36:47.306 --> 36:48.905
The only thing
you'll get out of this

36:48.937 --> 36:50.314
is a sore back.

37:02.825 --> 37:04.201
Here you are.

37:06.185 --> 37:08.137
Felix, got your cat?

37:08.170 --> 37:10.601
Tom, come and look!

37:10.634 --> 37:12.106
It's incredible.

37:12.138 --> 37:13.962
What's incredible
is how much time

37:13.993 --> 37:15.305
we've wasted in this place.

37:30.825 --> 37:31.625
Aaah!

37:34.985 --> 37:35.881
Squat!

37:38.922 --> 37:39.721
Tom.

37:42.889 --> 37:43.722
See that?

37:44.650 --> 37:46.090
A secret passage!

37:55.658 --> 37:58.090
From the look of it,
it's been here for years.

37:58.122 --> 37:59.498
Where do you think it leads?

37:59.530 --> 38:01.418
Probably nowhere.

38:01.450 --> 38:03.178
I bet your cat
came to a dead end

38:03.209 --> 38:04.938
which is why he turned back.

38:04.969 --> 38:06.154
Come on, my boy.

38:06.185 --> 38:08.489
Let's get out of here.

38:18.442 --> 38:19.466
I'm coming!

38:23.402 --> 38:24.362
I'm here about the sign.

38:24.394 --> 38:25.769
What sign?

38:25.801 --> 38:26.761
The for
sale sign out front.

38:26.793 --> 38:27.786
Oh, sorry, but I don't-

38:27.817 --> 38:29.609
- Listen, I'm from the big city

38:29.641 --> 38:31.145
looking to buy a summer home
here in the Miquelon Islands.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.650
Now like every
other city slicker

38:32.682 --> 38:34.409
who buys property
on the islands,

38:34.441 --> 38:36.010
I plan to leave the place
empty for 11 months of the year

38:36.041 --> 38:38.216
and I won't even
consider renting it out.

38:39.402 --> 38:41.386
During my brief summertime
visits, I'll keep to myself.

38:41.418 --> 38:42.730
I won't make friends
with the neighbors

38:42.761 --> 38:44.362
and I won't get involved
in the community.

38:44.393 --> 38:46.090
Eventually I'll get
sick of the place

38:46.122 --> 38:48.490
and put it up for sale at
a ridiculously high price

38:48.521 --> 38:51.689
in trying to squeeze maximum
profit out of my investment.

38:51.721 --> 38:53.673
I'm an up front guy, and rather
than waste time haggling,

38:53.706 --> 38:56.456
I'm gonna offer you exactly
the amount you're asking for

38:56.489 --> 38:57.513
even though we both
know it's way more

38:57.546 --> 38:58.666
than the house is worth.

38:58.698 --> 39:00.361
So do we have a deal?

39:02.410 --> 39:03.498
Wanna take a look around?

39:03.529 --> 39:04.362
No need for that.

39:04.393 --> 39:05.738
My sole condition

39:05.769 --> 39:07.369
is that you have to be
out of here by Saturday.

39:08.618 --> 39:10.122
That might be tricky.

39:10.153 --> 39:12.329
You see, the owner
isn't here right now.

39:12.362 --> 39:13.962
There's something you
need to know about me.

39:13.993 --> 39:15.242
I run an advertising agency.

39:15.274 --> 39:18.569
A very big advertising agency.

39:18.601 --> 39:19.818
So?

39:19.849 --> 39:21.481
So I make
commercials for this,

39:22.826 --> 39:25.353
and this, this, this,
this, this, this and this.

39:25.386 --> 39:27.689
And these things are
brought to you by me.

39:27.722 --> 39:30.729
Making commercials is
stressful, do you understand?

39:30.761 --> 39:32.393
To keep doing my
job, I need a place

39:32.426 --> 39:33.674
where I can totally kick back

39:33.705 --> 39:35.913
for three full
weeks every summer.

39:35.946 --> 39:37.866
So read my lips, lady.

39:37.897 --> 39:41.673
I want this house!

39:44.234 --> 39:45.546
Sorry.

39:45.577 --> 39:46.666
I'm an emotional guy.

39:49.386 --> 39:51.433
Well, my sister
will call you back

39:51.466 --> 39:52.649
as soon as she can?

39:53.482 --> 39:54.602
I want the house by Saturday.

39:54.634 --> 39:56.202
Otherwise, the deal's off.

39:56.233 --> 39:57.162
No, no, no, no!

39:57.193 --> 39:57.930
Oh!

39:59.242 --> 40:01.737
And that picture,
brought to you by me.

40:15.241 --> 40:16.233
Rover, no!

40:16.266 --> 40:18.250
Blech, that's someone's leg.

40:21.066 --> 40:23.977
This had better
not be a dead end.

40:24.010 --> 40:27.209
After the trouble we've
taken to come this far,

40:27.242 --> 40:30.058
I'll be very upset if
we have to turn back.

40:30.089 --> 40:31.114
Oh, ah!

40:32.521 --> 40:33.513
We're getting close.

40:35.562 --> 40:38.313
Oh no, a dead end.

40:38.346 --> 40:43.050
Shh, listen.

40:43.785 --> 40:44.970
What the heck's going on here?

40:48.873 --> 40:49.801
It's loose!

41:15.913 --> 41:19.946
Something tells me your
father's not far away.

41:21.065 --> 41:22.121
I'm coming!

41:23.530 --> 41:24.490
Hello?

41:24.521 --> 41:25.386
It's me.

41:25.417 --> 41:26.410
You left a message.

41:26.441 --> 41:27.818
How are things, Mia's okay?

41:27.849 --> 41:29.321
Oh, fine.

41:29.353 --> 41:31.754
And Felix, has he called yet?

41:31.785 --> 41:32.585
Marlene?

41:33.289 --> 41:35.146
I have something
to tell you, but

41:35.177 --> 41:36.937
I don't want you
losing your temper.

41:36.970 --> 41:37.930
What is it?

41:37.961 --> 41:38.953
I'm serious.

41:38.986 --> 41:40.329
Promise me you won't get upset.

41:40.361 --> 41:41.962
Yeah, sure.

41:41.993 --> 41:44.842
Say it, I
promise not to get upset.

41:44.873 --> 41:46.858
I promise not to get upset.

41:46.889 --> 41:48.457
Now what do you have to tell me?

41:48.490 --> 41:51.273
Well, it's like this.

41:52.297 --> 41:55.593
Felix is not really in Montreal.

41:55.625 --> 41:58.538
What do you mean not
really in Montreal?

41:58.569 --> 42:00.106
You're getting upset.

42:00.137 --> 42:02.857
What do you mean not
really in Montreal?

42:02.890 --> 42:04.169
That was a cover story.

42:04.202 --> 42:06.122
He's actually gone off
in a boat with old Tom.

42:06.153 --> 42:08.457
He wants to find his father.

42:09.737 --> 42:10.666
Marlene?

42:13.769 --> 42:16.361
Bagwell's really
getting on my nerves.

42:16.393 --> 42:18.153
He made me look foolish
in front of everyone

42:18.186 --> 42:21.066
after I went to the trouble
of bringing him here.

42:21.097 --> 42:23.913
He ruined my moment of glory!

42:25.226 --> 42:26.857
Can't I ever have
a moment's peace?

42:31.817 --> 42:33.769
Bruce!

42:33.802 --> 42:36.393
What a nice surprise.

42:36.426 --> 42:38.281
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

42:38.313 --> 42:39.626
I loved it.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.609
You wanna know the best
thing about being 40

42:41.642 --> 42:43.081
instead of 70?

42:44.137 --> 42:46.025
It's the way people look at you.

42:46.057 --> 42:49.801
Did you see how the
crowd greeted the new me?

42:50.474 --> 42:51.946
Oh, yes, I saw.

42:54.218 --> 42:55.786
10 million.

42:55.817 --> 42:58.601
I'm a man who keeps his word.

42:58.633 --> 42:59.978
Oh.

43:00.009 --> 43:01.898
Bruce, we're going
to make a great team.

43:07.273 --> 43:09.993
Time to
swing into action.

43:11.177 --> 43:14.345
You have reached the
national emergency hotline.

43:14.378 --> 43:17.258
For trouble of a
general sort, press one.

43:17.289 --> 43:19.977
For a specific
problem, press two.

43:21.706 --> 43:24.425
For a mechanical
failure, press one.

43:24.457 --> 43:27.433
For a broken item, press two.

43:27.466 --> 43:30.121
For a robbery, press three.

43:30.153 --> 43:33.161
For a disappearance, press four.

43:33.193 --> 43:34.442
For a-

43:34.473 --> 43:36.137
We are currently experiencing

43:36.169 --> 43:38.057
higher than normal call volume.

43:39.113 --> 43:41.258
This is driving me nuts!

43:42.986 --> 43:43.786
No!

43:44.585 --> 43:46.121
Hello, Coast Guard.

43:47.530 --> 43:48.873
What can I do for you?

43:48.905 --> 43:50.410
My 12 year old
nephew went off in a boat

43:50.441 --> 43:51.593
and hasn't returned.

43:51.626 --> 43:52.778
All right, I
need you to give me

43:52.809 --> 43:54.281
the exact time of departure

43:54.313 --> 43:56.137
and to describe the
boy and the boat.

43:56.170 --> 43:58.313
It was the day
before yesterday.

43:58.346 --> 44:00.970
He's on the small
side with red hair

44:01.001 --> 44:02.313
and rosy cheeks.

44:02.345 --> 44:04.298
And as for the boat,
it's a fishing boat.

44:04.329 --> 44:05.833
There's also a fisherman aboard.

44:05.866 --> 44:07.817
Oh jeez, the fisherman
is missing as well?

44:07.849 --> 44:08.969
I guess so.

44:09.002 --> 44:10.633
Apparently he's an elderly man

44:10.666 --> 44:12.938
who lives in the
lighthouse at Keppel Moon.

44:12.969 --> 44:14.793
Oh, you mean old Tom!?

44:14.825 --> 44:18.506
Oh, you can set your
mind at ease, Ma'am.

44:18.537 --> 44:20.329
They've just gone out fishing.

44:20.361 --> 44:22.313
No, no, no, no, they
haven't gone out fishing.

44:22.346 --> 44:23.849
They've gone to search for-

44:23.881 --> 44:25.993
- With old Tom, your
nephew's in good hands.

44:26.026 --> 44:27.434
No need to worry.

44:27.466 --> 44:29.322
And you can look forward
to some tasty fish

44:29.354 --> 44:30.921
when they get back.

44:30.953 --> 44:31.753
Good night.

44:39.626 --> 44:41.738
Construction starts next week.

44:41.769 --> 44:44.297
By the time we arrive at
the end of the summer,

44:44.329 --> 44:46.377
everything will
be up and running.

44:46.409 --> 44:48.937
Living quarters,
administrative offices.

44:48.970 --> 44:50.313
Aren't you worried

44:50.345 --> 44:52.810
about all that activity
attracting attention?

44:52.841 --> 44:54.665
The place is remote.

44:54.697 --> 44:58.601
Besides, everyone knows
Bagwell is egotistical enough

44:58.633 --> 45:00.586
to build an island
home for himself.

45:14.761 --> 45:16.298
Can you beat aces?

45:16.330 --> 45:19.786
Didn't
see that coming, didn't you?

45:19.817 --> 45:21.610
It's in the bag.

45:21.641 --> 45:22.633
Oh, hey, 500!

45:24.553 --> 45:25.865
You're a champ.

45:25.898 --> 45:27.657
You just arrived?

45:27.689 --> 45:29.673
Yeah, yes, right.

45:29.705 --> 45:31.497
Yeah, I can tell.

45:31.529 --> 45:33.929
Because you haven't
been transformed yet.

45:34.985 --> 45:36.970
No, no.

45:37.001 --> 45:37.993
Not quite yet.

45:38.025 --> 45:39.113
Don't worry.

45:39.146 --> 45:40.937
You won't have to wait long.

45:40.969 --> 45:43.753
They transformed Bruce
Bagwell just this morning.

45:43.785 --> 45:45.513
Bruce Bagwell?

45:45.545 --> 45:47.050
Bruce Bagwell's here?

45:47.082 --> 45:48.425
Sure.

45:48.457 --> 45:49.769
Whoah, weren't you
at the ceremony?

45:49.802 --> 45:51.593
Ah well, you see,

45:51.626 --> 45:54.602
Oh, you're gonna love
it here, man, believe me.

45:54.633 --> 45:56.489
This place is awesome.

45:56.522 --> 45:59.241
And Morgaa is wonderful.

45:59.273 --> 46:00.137
Morgaa?

46:00.169 --> 46:01.865
If it weren't for her,

46:01.897 --> 46:04.266
I'm not sure I'd
even be alive today.

46:05.897 --> 46:07.817
I made my money in
construction, man.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.513
- How'd you make yours?
- Tom, Tom!

46:09.545 --> 46:10.601
Tom!

46:10.633 --> 46:11.530
Don't interrupt, Felix.

46:11.561 --> 46:12.297
You really need to-

46:12.329 --> 46:13.385
- Can't you see
I'm talking here?

46:13.417 --> 46:13.994
Tom.

46:15.465 --> 46:17.353
Why didn't you
speak up sooner?

46:17.385 --> 46:18.409
See you around.

46:18.441 --> 46:19.722
Nice chatting with you, oh!

46:23.177 --> 46:24.169
Hurry, Tom!

46:25.033 --> 46:26.793
I'm not 20 anymore.

46:28.937 --> 46:29.737
Huh?

46:31.274 --> 46:32.553
Quick, this way!

46:34.154 --> 46:35.914
Slow down, will you?

46:45.353 --> 46:46.825
Wait a minute.

46:51.881 --> 46:52.713
Hmm.

46:53.961 --> 46:55.977
What on earth are you doing?

46:56.009 --> 46:58.473
This sailor's cap is my dad's.

47:00.874 --> 47:02.473
Oh sure, Rover
will sniff him out.

47:02.505 --> 47:04.393
Everyone knows that
cats are great at that.

47:05.577 --> 47:06.409
Hey you!

47:06.441 --> 47:07.977
Stop right there!

47:08.009 --> 47:09.033
Run, Felix!

47:10.409 --> 47:11.785
Haha, got ya!

47:20.009 --> 47:21.545
Care to dance?

47:27.273 --> 47:29.321
Haha, you can't outsmart me.

47:30.377 --> 47:31.754
Uh oh.

47:36.873 --> 47:37.929
Oh yes he can!

47:37.961 --> 47:38.825
Yeah!

47:49.930 --> 47:50.730
Huh?

48:08.713 --> 48:10.409
I have an idea!

48:10.441 --> 48:11.721
Great.

48:11.753 --> 48:13.770
As long as there's
no running involved.

48:13.802 --> 48:14.762
There's no running.

48:14.794 --> 48:16.682
But there is a bit of, oh!

48:16.714 --> 48:18.313
Whoah!

48:18.345 --> 48:20.297
Hold still, Rover, I can't see.

48:21.706 --> 48:23.977
Whew, it's kind of hot in here.

48:29.769 --> 48:30.537
Hey!

48:32.713 --> 48:34.633
You two see anything unusual,

48:34.665 --> 48:36.425
let me know immediately, okay?

48:37.417 --> 48:40.361
Aye aye, Captain, roger.

48:40.393 --> 48:44.105
All right, keep up the
good work.

48:52.330 --> 48:54.058
Looks like
Rover's caught a scent.

48:57.609 --> 49:00.842
Morgaa, what do you want now?

49:00.874 --> 49:01.674
Huh?

49:06.345 --> 49:07.498
Rover?

49:07.530 --> 49:09.161
How on earth?

49:09.193 --> 49:10.025
Tom?

49:12.137 --> 49:12.905
No, what?

49:15.466 --> 49:16.330
Felix?

49:16.361 --> 49:17.162
Yes.

49:17.961 --> 49:19.050
Dad!

49:19.082 --> 49:19.881
My boy!

49:25.577 --> 49:26.537
Oh, Dad!

49:27.881 --> 49:29.353
My son!

49:29.385 --> 49:31.369
I always knew
I'd find you again.

49:33.225 --> 49:34.025
Hmm.

49:38.857 --> 49:41.929
How could you possibly
have missed them?!

49:41.962 --> 49:44.489
It's too many
screens around here.

49:47.401 --> 49:48.297
Dimwits.

49:49.130 --> 49:52.361
I'm completely
surrounded by dimwits!

49:53.866 --> 49:55.369
I've put out an orange alert.

49:55.402 --> 49:57.482
We won't have no trouble
catching the intruders.

49:57.514 --> 49:58.282
Any.

49:58.314 --> 49:59.945
What?

49:59.977 --> 50:01.993
We won't have any trouble
catching the intruders.

50:02.025 --> 50:05.194
Didn't you ever
learn proper grammar?

50:05.226 --> 50:07.082
Dimwits everywhere!

50:08.938 --> 50:10.665
What if those intruders
have a connection

50:10.697 --> 50:11.657
with our prisoner?

50:13.001 --> 50:15.433
Look, I have a
baby sister now!

50:15.465 --> 50:16.714
A sister?

50:16.746 --> 50:19.049
She's your
little girl, Jack.

50:19.081 --> 50:21.578
After you disappeared,
Marlene discovered

50:21.610 --> 50:22.506
that she was pregnant.

50:22.538 --> 50:23.977
Oh, my daughter!

50:30.922 --> 50:31.721
Tom?

50:35.593 --> 50:37.449
Are you Madeleine's daughter?

50:37.481 --> 50:38.473
No.

50:38.505 --> 50:39.818
No, Tom.

50:39.850 --> 50:40.841
It's me.

50:40.874 --> 50:41.834
Madeleine?

50:41.866 --> 50:43.369
How can this be possible?

50:43.402 --> 50:46.410
Everyone calls her
Morgaa around here.

50:46.442 --> 50:47.338
Morgaa?

50:47.370 --> 50:48.872
Morgaa?

50:48.905 --> 50:49.993
As in the spider?

50:50.025 --> 50:51.049
Is this your son?

50:51.082 --> 50:52.873
He's my son.

50:52.905 --> 50:54.090
I see.

50:54.122 --> 50:55.818
You're alive.

50:55.849 --> 50:58.922
And exactly the same as
you were 40 years ago.

51:00.041 --> 51:02.569
You always were a
sweet talker, Tom.

51:02.602 --> 51:05.482
But I won't deny that
I've looked after myself.

51:05.514 --> 51:07.081
What are you doing here?

51:07.112 --> 51:08.458
She's the head
of the evil cult.

51:08.490 --> 51:11.977
Now, now, don't be rude.

51:12.009 --> 51:13.897
I'm the leader of
this community.

51:13.929 --> 51:14.953
The residents have come here

51:14.986 --> 51:17.130
entirely of their own accord.

51:17.162 --> 51:19.978
They've adopted a
peaceful, sincere lifestyle

51:20.010 --> 51:22.025
based on principles of harmony.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.473
There is one person who
arrived by accident.

51:26.506 --> 51:29.192
He isn't cooperating yet.

51:29.225 --> 51:31.658
But I'm sure that one
day he'll see the light

51:31.690 --> 51:33.097
and join our cause.

51:33.129 --> 51:35.113
Cause, what cause?

51:35.146 --> 51:36.937
My turn to ask some questions.

51:36.969 --> 51:40.106
Or rather, one question.

51:40.138 --> 51:42.826
How did you manage
to get into the city?

51:43.946 --> 51:46.441
No need to be shy.

51:46.472 --> 51:47.689
Yes?

51:47.722 --> 51:49.578
What, no.

51:49.609 --> 51:50.666
Can it wait?

51:50.698 --> 51:52.586
I'm in the middle of something.

51:52.618 --> 51:55.177
Fine, I'll be there in a minute.

51:55.209 --> 51:58.057
Sorry, but I'm needed elsewhere.

51:58.089 --> 52:00.106
Guards, get out.

52:00.138 --> 52:02.218
We'll leave these three
to their happy reunion.

52:08.649 --> 52:09.449
Pffft!

52:12.938 --> 52:14.377
What's going on?

52:14.409 --> 52:16.489
Look at this
hundred dollar bill.

52:16.522 --> 52:18.378
Yes, it's a hundred dollars.

52:18.409 --> 52:20.458
Watch this demonstration.

52:23.369 --> 52:24.872
What the?

52:24.905 --> 52:27.274
Bagwell paid us with
counterfeit bills.

52:27.305 --> 52:29.769
He's been laughing at
us since the very start!

52:36.010 --> 52:38.538
There's something else you
want to know about the man.

52:38.569 --> 52:41.578
I think you're going to
want to listen to this.

52:43.338 --> 52:45.001
You two should
never have come.

52:46.090 --> 52:48.776
I've spent two years
trying to escape this city.

52:48.809 --> 52:50.922
Half the time they
don't even lock my door.

52:50.953 --> 52:53.609
Once you're here,
you can't leave.

52:53.641 --> 52:56.521
But dad, we found
a secret passage.

52:56.552 --> 52:58.472
We can use it to get away!

53:01.802 --> 53:03.562
You.

53:03.594 --> 53:04.649
You're coming with us.

53:09.322 --> 53:10.474
Here.

53:10.505 --> 53:13.002
Your favorite tea, piping hot.

53:17.705 --> 53:20.042
Seems like only yesterday we
first discovered the island.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.336
We were so much in love.

53:23.369 --> 53:24.425
Do you remember?

53:28.265 --> 53:30.185
You told me about
a treasure chest

53:30.217 --> 53:32.170
hidden somewhere on the island.

53:32.202 --> 53:36.010
Ah, those were
just old sailors' stories.

53:37.066 --> 53:38.474
I was pretending to believe them

53:38.505 --> 53:42.154
because I knew they
fascinated you.

53:42.185 --> 53:45.065
I was pretending
to believe them too.

53:45.098 --> 53:47.497
I could see that made you happy.

53:47.530 --> 53:50.538
So it turns out
we were both pretending.

53:51.689 --> 53:54.186
Not about
what mattered, Tom.

53:54.217 --> 53:56.106
There was no
pretending about that.

54:02.026 --> 54:03.882
The morning after we arrived,

54:03.913 --> 54:05.802
while you were still asleep,

54:05.833 --> 54:08.746
I decided to go exploring
and find us some water.

54:09.577 --> 54:11.050
The path was narrow.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.426
I lost my footing.

54:15.498 --> 54:18.186
I tumbled a little
ways, and when I landed,

54:18.217 --> 54:19.402
I was in front of a cave.

54:33.706 --> 54:35.689
I felt something sting me.

54:35.722 --> 54:36.970
It was a spider.

54:37.001 --> 54:39.306
A small, silvery spider.

54:39.337 --> 54:41.096
I immediately became aware

54:41.129 --> 54:43.402
that something about
me was different.

54:43.433 --> 54:45.162
The streak of gray
hair that I've had

54:45.193 --> 54:49.033
since the age of 17 had
returned to its black color.

54:50.857 --> 54:53.929
That's when I realized
I'd found Morgaa,

54:53.962 --> 54:56.906
the famous spider of
the sailors' legends.

54:56.938 --> 54:59.050
And that Morgaa's real treasure

54:59.081 --> 55:01.865
wasn't gold or precious jewels.

55:01.898 --> 55:03.562
It was her venom

55:03.593 --> 55:06.217
and the immortality
that comes with it.

55:06.250 --> 55:07.146
Madeleine?

55:08.073 --> 55:08.649
Madeleine!

55:09.514 --> 55:11.434
I could hear you calling

55:11.465 --> 55:13.993
but I decided not to answer you.

55:14.026 --> 55:16.777
I was thinking of
myself and the treasure.

55:16.810 --> 55:19.178
So I stayed inside the
cave and hid from you.

55:27.689 --> 55:29.193
I betrayed you, Tom.

55:30.473 --> 55:31.721
And I'm not proud of it.

55:32.970 --> 55:35.242
You let me believe
you were dead

55:35.273 --> 55:38.282
so you could keep the
treasure to yourself?

55:38.314 --> 55:41.002
I knew that you wouldn't
want to keep that fortune.

55:41.033 --> 55:42.762
That you'd hand it
over to the authorities

55:42.793 --> 55:44.842
or else give it away
to some charity.

55:45.929 --> 55:47.466
You didn't care about money

55:47.497 --> 55:49.417
because you'd grown
up in a wealthy home.

55:49.450 --> 55:51.722
That's not how it
was in my family.

55:53.257 --> 55:55.273
Sometimes you have to choose
between hurting another

55:56.362 --> 55:57.578
and hurting yourself.

56:00.106 --> 56:01.066
Come.

56:01.097 --> 56:02.186
Let me show you something.

56:11.786 --> 56:13.546
Morgaa.

56:13.577 --> 56:15.337
Priceless, ageless,

56:16.393 --> 56:19.242
with the power to give
anyone eternal life.

56:20.202 --> 56:22.601
There, now you know everything.

56:28.842 --> 56:30.697
Om, om, om.

56:35.657 --> 56:37.353
Om.

56:37.386 --> 56:38.602
What are
you doing here?

56:38.633 --> 56:41.353
I'm monitoring
the house's chakras.

56:41.386 --> 56:43.721
I wanna be sure they're
in the right alignment.

56:43.754 --> 56:45.482
And are they?

56:45.513 --> 56:47.017
Nope.

56:47.050 --> 56:48.393
The house needs to
be moved further east

56:48.425 --> 56:49.737
and the door should
be on the other side,

56:49.770 --> 56:51.690
just as I suspected.

56:51.721 --> 56:53.897
Om.

56:53.929 --> 56:55.722
Om.

56:55.753 --> 56:57.929
And don't forget I need you
out of the place by Saturday!

57:01.001 --> 57:02.954
That was when the
idea came to me,

57:02.985 --> 57:05.353
to create an
enlightened community

57:05.386 --> 57:07.658
far from the decadence
and selfishness

57:07.689 --> 57:09.513
of modern society.

57:09.545 --> 57:12.937
And now, Tom, you can help
me make that community

57:12.970 --> 57:14.857
stronger than ever.

57:14.890 --> 57:16.202
You and I can finally share

57:16.233 --> 57:17.833
the love that we missed out on

57:17.866 --> 57:19.593
all those many years ago.

57:19.626 --> 57:22.762
You say this community
of yours isn't a cult.

57:22.793 --> 57:24.297
Prove it.

57:24.330 --> 57:25.353
Let us leave here.

57:28.201 --> 57:30.377
All right, we're done here.

57:30.409 --> 57:32.201
Sooner or later,
you'll tell the world

57:32.233 --> 57:34.538
about what you'd
seen in Forever City.

57:34.569 --> 57:37.001
People would come from
every corner of the globe

57:37.033 --> 57:39.049
eager for eternal youth.

57:39.082 --> 57:41.770
Our community would be ruined.

57:41.801 --> 57:43.690
I can't let that happen.

57:43.721 --> 57:47.978
Whether you like it or
not, you're here forever.

57:48.009 --> 57:51.466
And I do like that,
Tom, very much.

57:53.161 --> 57:55.625
I always believed that
fate would reunite us.

57:57.193 --> 57:57.993
Hmm?

58:12.490 --> 58:14.377
Money, money, money.

58:34.154 --> 58:36.457
Bruce, can you go
see what that noise is?

58:39.881 --> 58:40.682
Bruce?

58:56.777 --> 58:58.633
Tom, have you seen Felix?

58:58.666 --> 59:00.905
No, I was asleep.

59:03.593 --> 59:04.457
Your face!

59:05.642 --> 59:07.306
I've asked you
both to come here

59:07.337 --> 59:09.001
because I always
like to meet subjects

59:09.033 --> 59:10.601
before they're transformed.

59:10.634 --> 59:12.137
How old do you want
to be, Filbert?

59:12.169 --> 59:13.514
Felix.

59:13.546 --> 59:15.401
I'm fine with the age
I've got, thank you.

59:15.434 --> 59:17.866
What I really want is
to leave this place.

59:17.897 --> 59:19.690
Yes, well, I'm afraid leaving

59:19.721 --> 59:21.129
is out of the
question, young man.

59:22.025 --> 59:23.433
Agh!

59:23.465 --> 59:25.290
Get your hands off me!

59:25.321 --> 59:27.145
I can walk by myself, thank you.

59:28.330 --> 59:29.130
Tom?

59:31.241 --> 59:33.097
Very nice.

59:33.130 --> 59:35.113
Why have you done this to me?

59:35.146 --> 59:38.825
Because I knew what a
fine 40 year old you'd be.

59:38.857 --> 59:41.737
You turned out even
better than I expected.

59:42.826 --> 59:45.417
Oh my, it's so warm in here.

59:45.450 --> 59:47.497
You had no right
to transform me!

59:47.530 --> 59:49.577
You'd rather have
white hair, a bent back,

59:49.609 --> 59:50.858
and arthritic limbs?

59:50.889 --> 59:52.330
Get out of my way!

59:52.361 --> 59:54.217
I want to talk to
Morgaa right now!

59:55.241 --> 59:57.930
What have you done
to my husband?

59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.226
Dad!

01:00:01.257 --> 01:00:02.921
It's not very good manners
to burst into people's homes

01:00:02.953 --> 01:00:04.169
and shout at them.

01:00:04.202 --> 01:00:05.737
Manners, shmanners.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.657
I demand a clear explanation!

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:11.753
You are in no position to
be demanding anything, Lydia.

01:00:11.786 --> 01:00:13.929
But since you're here,
I might as well show you

01:00:13.962 --> 01:00:15.722
the unpleasant truth.

01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:18.250
You see, your husband
was planning to steal

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:22.186
our transformation equipment
and escape from Forever City.

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:25.769
Alone, leaving you and
your daughter behind.

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.362
Do you really think
I'd be dumb enough

01:00:28.394 --> 01:00:31.082
to settle for a boring
wife and daughter

01:00:31.113 --> 01:00:34.025
when I can go out with a
different beautiful woman

01:00:34.058 --> 01:00:36.490
every single night for
the rest of eternity?

01:00:37.994 --> 01:00:41.673
So, is that clear
enough for you?

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:49.161
Ooh, it's time to
change his diaper.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:56.617
Tom?

01:00:59.017 --> 01:00:59.849
Come here.

01:01:05.321 --> 01:01:06.665
It opens all the doors!

01:01:07.786 --> 01:01:10.025
We'll escape tonight,
when everyone's asleep.

01:01:11.146 --> 01:01:12.169
No.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.897
Even if we manage to get out,

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.817
we'll be caught right away.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.609
Others have tried to get away.

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:19.625
You don't wanna know
what happened to them.

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:21.737
But Dad, we can't
just stay in this place

01:01:21.769 --> 01:01:23.305
for the rest of eternity!

01:01:25.545 --> 01:01:27.818
Morgaa wants to transform me.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.569
She'll make me an
adult, nearly your age!

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.249
I wanna have you as a
father, not as a brother.

01:01:35.177 --> 01:01:37.385
Besides, if we stay here,

01:01:37.418 --> 01:01:40.617
Mom and Mia will spend
their lives waiting for us.

01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:42.889
Hmm.

01:01:50.026 --> 01:01:51.465
You're right, son.

01:01:51.497 --> 01:01:52.746
We leave tonight.

01:01:57.257 --> 01:01:59.562
Take a bite for Auntie Annie!

01:02:01.322 --> 01:02:02.121
Yay, ya!

01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:05.354
Oh, Marlene.

01:02:05.386 --> 01:02:06.153
Oh!

01:02:14.762 --> 01:02:15.914
Whoah!

01:02:15.946 --> 01:02:17.449
What's with all the rough stuff!

01:02:18.537 --> 01:02:20.969
That's no way to treat
a senior citizen.

01:02:23.209 --> 01:02:24.777
What?

01:02:26.057 --> 01:02:27.850
Why are you both
staring at me like that?

01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:28.649
Nothing.

01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:29.737
What?!

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:32.809
What?

01:02:34.761 --> 01:02:36.457
Tada!

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:37.450
What's that?

01:02:37.481 --> 01:02:38.794
Morgaa's keycard.

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:40.393
Dad and I have come
up with a plan.

01:02:40.425 --> 01:02:43.113
The three of us
will escape tonight.

01:02:43.145 --> 01:02:45.065
Getting out of here
isn't going to be easy.

01:02:45.097 --> 01:02:46.409
We need to move fast

01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:47.977
while everyone is
distracted by Bagwell.

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:49.769
Yes, but...

01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:50.890
You don't want all three of us

01:02:50.921 --> 01:02:52.905
staying here forever, do you?

01:02:52.937 --> 01:02:55.017
I didn't say that, my
boy, I didn't say that.

01:03:12.137 --> 01:03:13.033
Shh!

01:03:13.065 --> 01:03:13.865
Be quiet!

01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:15.785
This way.

01:03:41.322 --> 01:03:43.657
I'm sure it was
around here somewhere.

01:03:43.689 --> 01:03:45.897
We don't have much time left.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.706
Dad, Tom!

01:03:49.737 --> 01:03:51.305
I think Rover's found something!

01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:54.570
Oh, he sure is smart.

01:03:54.602 --> 01:03:57.065
Wow, that is one strange cat.

01:04:12.329 --> 01:04:13.481
Haha, good boy!

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:20.009
Hurry, it won't be long
before they notice we're gone.

01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:21.257
You know which
way to go, right?

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:22.185
Straight ahead.

01:04:22.217 --> 01:04:24.041
Exactly, okay.

01:04:24.073 --> 01:04:25.482
Get moving, you two.

01:04:25.514 --> 01:04:27.178
This is where I say goodbye.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:28.649
What?

01:04:28.681 --> 01:04:29.993
I'm staying.

01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:31.753
What do you
mean you're staying?

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:34.122
You have a wife and child
waiting for you back home.

01:04:34.154 --> 01:04:36.553
I don't have anyone
waiting for me.

01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:39.241
Besides, your best chance
of getting off the island

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:42.121
is with me staying here
to create a diversion.

01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:43.690
You don't have
to do that for us.

01:04:43.722 --> 01:04:45.578
This place is a prison, Tom.

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:48.137
You can't spend
eternity in a prison.

01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:50.121
I'm staying, and that's final.

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.658
To help pass the time.

01:05:05.353 --> 01:05:06.153
Mmm.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.841
Now go on, you don't
have a second to lose!

01:05:23.593 --> 01:05:25.352
This is serious.

01:05:26.473 --> 01:05:28.618
The future of our
city's at stake.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:32.426
We need to defend the
island at all cost.

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:34.410
I want you to reinforce security

01:05:34.442 --> 01:05:36.841
in all the strategic zones.

01:05:36.872 --> 01:05:38.985
Here, here and here.

01:05:39.017 --> 01:05:39.625
Understood?

01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:43.721
Who let you out of your room?

01:05:43.753 --> 01:05:45.098
For reasons I
don't understand,

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:46.890
my door was unlocked.

01:05:46.922 --> 01:05:48.906
When I realized
people were awake,

01:05:48.938 --> 01:05:51.497
I stepped out to see
what was going on.

01:05:51.529 --> 01:05:52.714
Are you preparing
for the arrival

01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:54.185
of Bagwell's henchmen?

01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:56.394
How do you know about that?

01:05:56.426 --> 01:05:58.601
Morgaa asked
for my assistance.

01:05:58.634 --> 01:06:01.097
So here I am.

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:01.961
Tommy!

01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:07.882
Felix.

01:06:07.914 --> 01:06:09.609
Are we there yet?

01:06:09.641 --> 01:06:11.625
Settle down, Dad.

01:06:11.657 --> 01:06:13.545
Usually kids ask
parents that question,

01:06:13.577 --> 01:06:15.497
not the other way around.

01:06:15.529 --> 01:06:17.353
Okay, okay.

01:06:17.385 --> 01:06:19.305
Bagwell arranged
for a helicopter

01:06:19.337 --> 01:06:20.265
to pick him up.

01:06:20.297 --> 01:06:22.153
We must neutralize it.

01:06:22.185 --> 01:06:24.777
No one can escape from here.

01:06:24.809 --> 01:06:28.777
Now, go take up your
positions all over the island.

01:06:28.809 --> 01:06:30.569
Hang on, can I say something?

01:06:30.601 --> 01:06:32.042
Yes, what is it?

01:06:32.074 --> 01:06:33.962
If we spread out to
every part of the island,

01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:36.361
we'll weaken our forces.

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.706
I think we should figure out

01:06:37.738 --> 01:06:39.754
where Bagwell's henchmen
are most likely to land.

01:06:39.786 --> 01:06:42.313
Hmm, yes, go on.

01:06:42.345 --> 01:06:44.522
The best spot to land
the helicopter is here

01:06:44.554 --> 01:06:46.314
in the northeast sector.

01:06:46.346 --> 01:06:48.234
It's the only real
clearing on the island.

01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:50.761
How do you know they
won't land here instead

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.009
in the western sector?

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.962
There's wide beach in the area.

01:06:53.994 --> 01:06:55.241
Impossible.

01:06:55.274 --> 01:06:56.681
They won't wanna
risk getting caught

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.537
by the rising tide.

01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:00.585
Orange alert!

01:07:00.618 --> 01:07:01.481
The boy and his
father have vanished!

01:07:01.513 --> 01:07:02.377
No!

01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:04.297
Oh.

01:07:05.482 --> 01:07:06.281
Tom.

01:07:07.594 --> 01:07:11.081
Sometimes you have to
choose between hurting another

01:07:11.113 --> 01:07:12.234
and hurting yourself.

01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:19.018
Send all personnel to the
western sector of the island.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:21.673
And arrest that man immediately.

01:07:37.832 --> 01:07:40.298
Charlotte, it's
your turn to give your father

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.737
his baby bottle.

01:07:41.769 --> 01:07:42.986
I'm sleeping!

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:47.561
Hang on,
I don't feel so good.

01:07:47.593 --> 01:07:49.546
Let's go, old man.

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:58.218
On second thought.

01:07:58.249 --> 01:07:59.594
I feel great!

01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:04.712
Keep it down out here.

01:08:04.745 --> 01:08:07.849
I'm trying to put
my husband to sleep!

01:08:14.409 --> 01:08:15.818
The sky!

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.089
It's so beautiful!

01:08:18.121 --> 01:08:19.305
Dad, hurry!

01:08:31.978 --> 01:08:33.609
What are
you doing here?

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.050
I can explain.

01:08:35.081 --> 01:08:36.586
You're in trouble, my friend.

01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:37.578
No, no wait.

01:08:37.609 --> 01:08:38.921
I have something for you.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:40.393
I got it from Captain Roger.

01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:52.106
Now, how do I open this thing?

01:08:52.138 --> 01:08:53.290
What could it be?

01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:55.721
Yes!

01:08:55.752 --> 01:08:56.520
Oh!

01:08:59.818 --> 01:09:01.609
Her birthday, August 2nd.

01:09:05.386 --> 01:09:06.345
My birthday.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.290
Once we're a
hundred meters out,

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:18.826
the current will take us.

01:09:21.064 --> 01:09:22.537
Tom!

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:23.497
Felix!

01:09:24.841 --> 01:09:25.674
Huh?

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:36.904
Bullseye!

01:09:36.937 --> 01:09:38.792
You're gonna
need a bigger rock!

01:09:38.825 --> 01:09:40.841
Oh!

01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:41.737
He's mine!

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:42.792
No, he's mine!

01:09:42.826 --> 01:09:44.551
No, I saw him first!

01:09:44.585 --> 01:09:45.929
Step aside!

01:09:45.962 --> 01:09:50.761
Special delivery!

01:09:52.265 --> 01:09:53.609
Even if I wanted to,

01:09:53.642 --> 01:09:56.329
I couldn't permit
you two to leave.

01:09:56.362 --> 01:09:58.090
If you go back to
the outside world,

01:09:58.122 --> 01:10:00.776
sooner or later people
will learn about us,

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:02.890
then everyone will be
fighting for a share

01:10:02.922 --> 01:10:04.042
of our invention.

01:10:04.073 --> 01:10:05.802
We won't say anything!

01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:08.842
And I'm
supposed to believe that?

01:10:08.873 --> 01:10:11.849
Are you going to cross
your heart and hope to die?

01:10:14.025 --> 01:10:18.089
As for you, Jack, I'm
disappointed in you.

01:10:18.121 --> 01:10:19.529
Don't you see?

01:10:19.562 --> 01:10:21.482
Eternal life isn't a blessing.

01:10:21.514 --> 01:10:23.050
It's a curse!

01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:25.354
A person who doesn't
get old can't evolve,

01:10:25.385 --> 01:10:27.753
can't ever gain
the wisdom of age.

01:10:27.786 --> 01:10:29.993
I want to know how
it feels to be 50

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:31.626
and 60 and 70.

01:10:31.657 --> 01:10:33.673
From what I hear,
it's overrated.

01:10:36.682 --> 01:10:38.249
Tom!

01:10:38.281 --> 01:10:40.330
What are you doing
with that, you fool?

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:42.473
Give it back to me this instant!

01:10:42.506 --> 01:10:43.594
That's an order!

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:44.969
Of course.

01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:47.017
As soon as you let
those two leave.

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:48.937
Poor old man.

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.890
Take a look around you.

01:10:50.922 --> 01:10:53.770
You're not really in a position
to be giving me orders.

01:10:53.802 --> 01:10:54.730
Oh no?

01:10:54.762 --> 01:10:56.170
What if I lift the lid?

01:10:56.201 --> 01:10:57.481
No!

01:10:57.513 --> 01:10:59.336
Put that on the ground

01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:01.256
and step back three meters!

01:11:01.289 --> 01:11:03.433
After you let Jack
and Felix leave.

01:11:09.033 --> 01:11:10.186
Come on, Dad.

01:11:10.218 --> 01:11:12.106
Let's get outta here.

01:11:12.138 --> 01:11:13.289
Tom!

01:11:13.322 --> 01:11:14.089
Ugh!

01:11:14.122 --> 01:11:14.890
No!

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:19.849
Help me catch the spider!

01:11:19.882 --> 01:11:21.866
Attack them, you dimwits!

01:11:22.954 --> 01:11:23.849
Huh?

01:11:23.882 --> 01:11:25.898
Oh, no, come back here!

01:11:25.929 --> 01:11:26.794
Where is it?

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:27.785
Take that!

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:31.210
And that!

01:11:39.017 --> 01:11:40.681
Let me go!

01:11:43.817 --> 01:11:44.650
Get off me!

01:11:46.858 --> 01:11:48.746
Get this bird away from me!

01:11:48.778 --> 01:11:49.546
There!

01:11:49.577 --> 01:11:50.633
What, where?

01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:51.626
Oh no.

01:11:51.658 --> 01:11:53.642
Come on, come on, come on!

01:11:55.466 --> 01:11:56.233
Strike one!

01:11:59.177 --> 01:12:00.137
Strike two!

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.042
Strike three!

01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:07.786
You're out!

01:12:07.817 --> 01:12:09.129
Ha!

01:12:09.161 --> 01:12:13.353
You see anything unusual
now, Captain Roger?

01:12:14.954 --> 01:12:16.297
Where's that spider?

01:12:19.177 --> 01:12:19.977
Oh!

01:12:20.649 --> 01:12:22.090
Yes, I see it!

01:12:22.122 --> 01:12:23.242
Rover, stop her!

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:30.697
Ah!

01:12:32.873 --> 01:12:33.673
Look out!

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.577
No, no, no!

01:12:40.778 --> 01:12:41.578
No!

01:12:49.193 --> 01:12:49.993
Hah!

01:12:50.026 --> 01:12:50.986
I'm too fast,

01:12:51.913 --> 01:12:52.713
for you!

01:13:11.146 --> 01:13:12.202
I failed!

01:13:12.233 --> 01:13:14.378
My time has come.

01:13:14.409 --> 01:13:17.610
But you know, losing
is a best way to learn

01:13:17.641 --> 01:13:19.209
and today we've learned a lot!

01:13:22.185 --> 01:13:22.985
Huh?

01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:25.417
Hmm.

01:13:27.626 --> 01:13:29.257
Sweety pie.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.377
Take that!

01:13:30.409 --> 01:13:32.106
Tom, over here!

01:13:37.481 --> 01:13:38.409
Tommy?

01:13:40.298 --> 01:13:41.993
Farewell, old friend.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:46.729
Hurry, Tom.

01:13:46.762 --> 01:13:49.225
Hey, I'm not 40
anymore, my boy.

01:14:05.929 --> 01:14:07.626
Well, the Coast
Guard rescue vessel

01:14:07.657 --> 01:14:08.713
set out about an hour ago.

01:14:08.746 --> 01:14:09.962
That's terrific.

01:14:10.889 --> 01:14:11.978
Oh, there's your buyer.

01:14:12.009 --> 01:14:14.377
I warn you, he's
kind of intense.

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:15.593
I'm coming.

01:14:17.321 --> 01:14:18.346
You the owner of this house?

01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:19.721
Ah, yes, why?

01:14:19.754 --> 01:14:22.217
I'm leaving for the
city, the big city.

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.137
So I need you to sign
this contract right away.

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:25.801
You hear what I'm saying,
it's now or never.

01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:27.113
I'm sorry, but you
couldn't have come

01:14:27.146 --> 01:14:28.681
at a worse time.

01:14:28.713 --> 01:14:29.866
You need to
sign here, sign here,

01:14:29.897 --> 01:14:30.761
initial this, and
here, and here,

01:14:30.793 --> 01:14:32.009
and over here too.

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:34.154
If I were you I
wouldn't insist.

01:14:34.185 --> 01:14:36.777
You're going to have to
come back in a few days.

01:14:36.809 --> 01:14:37.802
Forget it.

01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:39.241
The bulldozers are on their way.

01:14:39.273 --> 01:14:40.682
This is gonna happen today!

01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:43.306
The house is no
longer for sale!

01:14:44.297 --> 01:14:47.369
But-

01:14:57.545 --> 01:14:58.473
What's that, stop!

01:14:58.505 --> 01:14:59.305
Oh, oh!

01:15:00.682 --> 01:15:02.569
What's that building?

01:15:02.602 --> 01:15:05.321
That's the
abandoned fish plant.

01:15:05.353 --> 01:15:06.377
I'll be right back.

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:12.777
Why'd you wanna take
pictures of that old place?

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:14.953
My friend, an artist
doesn't see things

01:15:14.986 --> 01:15:17.801
the way they are, but
the way they could be.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:03.850
Daddy!

01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:51.873
