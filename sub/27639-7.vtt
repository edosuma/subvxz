WEBVTT

00:02.102 --> 00:03.802
you each get one treat.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.772
Ah, Pastor Nina,
you win a big game?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.041
Oh, it's T-ball, Mr. Kim.
Everybody wins.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.276
Ah, because kids get exercise.

00:11.344 --> 00:12.811
And because we don't keep score.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.713
So, how you know
which team is better?

00:14.781 --> 00:15.914
They both are.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.784
Ah. But one team must score
more than the other team.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.219
Score-keeping is frowned upon.

00:20.287 --> 00:24.456
And you must see who is hitting
and catching and scoring.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.426
I see inspired efforts
from all children.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.828
But, uh, you know who won.

00:30.597 --> 00:31.897
Everybody has fun.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.700
But, uh... you know.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.236
Okay, we crushed them!

00:37.538 --> 00:39.604
It was a bloodbath!
Everybody knew it.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.706
Oh, oh! It feels
so good to say it!

00:41.709 --> 00:43.442
We work so hard,
and no one is allowed

00:43.510 --> 00:44.643
to acknowledge anything!
It's crazy.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.012
-Okay, okay!
-Oh, Hallelujah, my team won!

00:47.080 --> 00:48.280
[kid] We did?

00:48.348 --> 00:49.948
Hey! We won the game!

00:49.950 --> 00:51.617
We won the game. Yeah.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.685
Winners! Winners! Winners!

00:53.754 --> 00:56.121
No, she kidding. Nobody win.
Everyone lose.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.489
-Winners! Winners!
-Put that down.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.925
Yeah. Stop! No looting. Stop!

00:59.993 --> 01:01.026
You break, you pay.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.095
Yeah.<i> Yobo! Yobo!</i>

01:03.097 --> 01:05.264
[theme music playing]

01:23.317 --> 01:24.650
Uh, do I swipe or tap?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.852
Insert, use PIN.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.354
Ooh. I have a rhyme
to remember it,

01:29.422 --> 01:31.523
but nothing
to remember the rhyme.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.759
-[door opens]
-Hi, Appa. Hi, Frank.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.994
Sorry! Just--
Just gimme a second.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.596
-[Appa] Where's my drill?
-What?

01:37.664 --> 01:39.331
You take my drill last week,

01:39.399 --> 01:40.999
no asking, just stealing.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.634
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.136
But you never borrow it back.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.237
[Janet] Gerald was putting up
more photos,

01:45.305 --> 01:46.371
so I thought I'd hang on to it.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.039
Not yours to hang on to.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.242
Always treating my thing
like it's you thing.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.810
Relax! It's a drill.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.879
[sighs] This is why
I can't lend tool.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.481
Children never learn.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.515
No respect.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.017
Oh, I wouldn't know. I never
had children of my own.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.152
But if I did,

02:00.220 --> 02:01.220
I'd love nothing more

02:01.288 --> 02:02.654
than to pass
my tools on to them.

02:02.722 --> 02:04.156
See the joy on their faces.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.024
I always thought,
if I had a daughter,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.060
I'd have given her the lathe.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.862
-See, Appa?
-[Appa] Yeah.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.063
I see you make a grown man sad.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.066
-Oh, I'm not sad.
-You make me sad.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.368
At least, Frank
lend me his drill.

02:16.436 --> 02:17.669
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Kim,

02:17.671 --> 02:19.871
I have a very strict
no-lending policy.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.908
I'm sure you understand,
given your lending history.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.009
[sighs] Call Gerald!

02:24.011 --> 02:25.177
Tell him bring back drill.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.512
-He's in class all day.
-[Appa] Fine. I get myself.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.214
-Fine.
-[Frank] Oh, here we go.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.049
-Hm.
-You remember PIN?

02:31.117 --> 02:33.252
Nope. But I found
my library card.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.191
[Shannon] And you'll need these.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.560
You're gonna do great.
It's a pretty easy presentation.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.862
-Cool.
-Unless you want me to stay?
I can stay.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.597
Don't be silly.
It's your friend's wedding.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.699
Well, Alejandro's
ex-roommate, Ronnie.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.401
Apparently, they were
supes close.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.269
-Ronnie's a guy?
-Still not clear.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.705
But I know that Ronnie's
"quite the catch",

02:53.773 --> 02:55.274
and Alejandro said he might cry

02:55.342 --> 02:56.942
when Ronnie
comes down the aisle.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.544
-Totally normal.
-I'll only be gone for the day.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.914
Well, I hope it's a day, there's
an escape-room reception.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.916
And I really would stay,
but Alejandro's singing
at the ceremony--

03:04.919 --> 03:07.619
Go! You just focus on your
not-at-all weird wedding.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.287
Presentation handled.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.957
Hey! You guys talking
about the presentaysh?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.926
I loved those
when I was assistant manager.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.327
If you need any help, I'm here.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.762
-Jung was actually really great
at working the room.
-Slayed it.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.465
Thanks for the offer,
but I think I'll make
my own impression.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.267
Ooh. I wouldn't do impressions.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.837
That's a joke. I actually would
do impressions. They killed.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.905
-[Janet giggles]
-I got it, thanks.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.707
-Just let me know.
-Just did.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.175
I do a mean Liam Neeson.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.743
I don't see that helping.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.445
Okay, I'm off.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.481
Alejandro wants to get there
early to do Ronnie's hair.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.250
-Any questions?
-So many.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.319
-About the presentation?
-No.

03:40.987 --> 03:41.920
Okay.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.157
[inaudible]

03:49.195 --> 03:50.529
Tsk. Gerald.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.600
[sighs] No respect.

03:57.537 --> 03:58.637
[sighs]

04:00.307 --> 04:01.240
Whoa!

04:01.675 --> 04:02.641
[grunts]

04:04.712 --> 04:05.978
Water bed.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.128
Oh!

04:24.031 --> 04:25.030
[laughing]

04:26.133 --> 04:27.099
[thudding]

04:29.436 --> 04:30.369
Hello?

04:30.704 --> 04:31.737
[objects clattering]

04:41.548 --> 04:42.648
[both scream]

04:43.583 --> 04:45.283
[laughing]

04:45.286 --> 04:46.351
What you doing?

04:46.419 --> 04:48.219
I thought you the burglar.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.388
So you hit me with a broom?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.422
Oh, I don't know!

04:50.658 --> 04:51.657
[sighing]

04:51.859 --> 04:54.359
Maybe I just a scared
little housemaid, huh?

04:54.427 --> 04:58.697
Oh. Well, maybe I just
a out-of-town business tycoon.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
Looking for some action?
[chuckles]

05:01.968 --> 05:02.901
Yeah.

05:04.371 --> 05:05.470
Yeah?

05:05.538 --> 05:09.441
Yeah. I keep this apartment
in city for high-end deal,

05:09.509 --> 05:10.442
and, uh...

05:12.445 --> 05:14.579
high-stake entertainment.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.148
[both chuckle]

05:18.952 --> 05:20.018
I go lock door.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.887
Ah, leave it! More dangerous.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.422
[both laughing]

05:25.559 --> 05:28.794
Wait. You ever go
sailing on high sea?

05:29.429 --> 05:30.395
[both giggling]

05:33.133 --> 05:35.801
"As you can see, the mid-size
are our most popular."

05:36.070 --> 05:39.738
Are our. Arr Arr. Our are.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.606
I'll change it. [sighs]

05:42.175 --> 05:43.709
Hey, man.
Couldn't help but overhear.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.078
-All the way from the garage?
-And it sounds amazing.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.180
How about, like, a joke?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.914
"Here at Handy,
if you want to rent a Hyundai,

05:49.983 --> 05:51.349
that 'Sonata' problem."

05:51.418 --> 05:53.285
-Yeah. I'm good.
-I got more.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.387
You can change the words
to make them your own,

05:55.455 --> 05:56.922
but the wording's
pretty solid as is.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.291
Oh, I also came across
some old notes
from my previous presentations.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.793
I appreciate it, but I got this.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.661
Oh, "but<i> I've</i> got this."

06:03.664 --> 06:05.497
You have to enunciate.
You mumble too much--

06:05.565 --> 06:06.665
I've got this!

06:07.134 --> 06:09.234
-Okay, but, like, less yelly.
-Jung, stop.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.502
I don't need your advice!

06:11.638 --> 06:13.037
Fine. Just trying to help.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.640
Then do your job and move
those cars like I asked!

06:15.708 --> 06:18.610
Okay! You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.677
Apparently, I do.

06:19.746 --> 06:20.812
Well, you're nailing it.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.748
And I can make
my own stupid jokes.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.816
"Sonata" problem for me, either!

06:24.818 --> 06:26.151
That's the same joke!

06:29.589 --> 06:31.123
-Do you have anything smaller?
-Nope.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.326
-Um, want a bag?
-Nope.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.762
-Nice day out isn't it?
-Gorgeous.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.164
Okay.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.804
Oh! Hi, Janet.

06:47.007 --> 06:47.973
Hey.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.876
[door opens]

06:51.278 --> 06:53.245
Oh. Hello, Umma.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.014
You just getting back from...

06:56.082 --> 06:57.416
-Shopping.
-[Appa] Hmm.

06:57.718 --> 07:01.286
Funny how we both getting home
at, uh, different time.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.988
Why are you being so weird?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.023
Why is your apartment so messy?

07:05.325 --> 07:06.525
You were at my apartment?

07:07.227 --> 07:08.160
To get drill.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.861
Where is it?

07:11.832 --> 07:15.467
Janet, if I bring
my drill back for you,

07:16.035 --> 07:18.670
-how you learn respect
other people's thing, hm?
-[Umma] Hm.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.005
So, I go, look at drill,

07:21.074 --> 07:22.440
make sure drill is okay.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.076
But it's you job to bring back.

07:25.345 --> 07:27.078
Wouldn't it be easier if you
brought it back yourself?

07:27.314 --> 07:29.013
Why should I do your work?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.382
I not you maid.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.084
Or out-of-town business tycoon.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.187
We go upstair.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.059
[door closes]

07:41.127 --> 07:42.694
I was trying
to park them alphabetically.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.330
It's fine. Just...

07:45.932 --> 07:46.898
walk away from the cars.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.470
[engine starts]

07:53.507 --> 07:54.506
[Kimchee] Ah!

07:54.807 --> 07:55.840
[groaning]

07:56.442 --> 07:58.710
-What happened?
-My foot! You ran over my foot.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.879
Kimch, I'm so sorry!
I-- I never saw you.

08:00.947 --> 08:02.580
You, in the blue shirt,
call 911!

08:02.649 --> 08:04.549
Tell them we have an injured
person and report back to me.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.117
Wait. I don't need an ambulance.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.685
I just need Terence
to drive me to the hospital.

08:07.754 --> 08:10.255
-I'll do it.
-No! I need you
to do the presentation.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.724
I am so sorry. I didn't see you.
I never would have backed up.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.726
It's fine.
It's an accident. Just go.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.561
You, in the blue shirt,
let's get him in the car.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.231
Let's get him
in a different car.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.738
Think your sock
got mixed up in my laundry.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.072
Oh. That's not mine.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.541
Well, Chelsea's in the Bahamas,

08:29.609 --> 08:30.976
and I only wear sockettes.

08:31.778 --> 08:32.777
Unless I'm outside.

08:32.845 --> 08:33.912
We're in a "hot zone" for ticks.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.081
-What are you eating?
-Kimbap.

08:36.449 --> 08:37.716
I think your mom
dropped some off.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.152
-Wait, where was it?
-In the fridge.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.487
No, the sock.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.055
Oh. Twisted up
in my duvet covers.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.392
-It's kind of big.
-Oh, my God!

08:48.595 --> 08:50.028
-It's mine.
-You sure?

08:50.096 --> 08:51.263
Yep. I'll just take it.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.132
Why are you
holding it like that?

08:54.634 --> 08:55.600
Because it's dirty.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.068
I should throw it out.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.904
Or burn it. Just kidding.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.707
I won't burn it because it's
my sock. That would be weird.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.010
And if it was in the laundry,
that means it's clean.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.612
Right. But how clean
is the laundry?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.481
Maybe we should wash it again,
to be safe.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.150
Um, anything you want
to throw in? Your sheets
and pillow cases?

09:12.652 --> 09:13.618
I'm good.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.920
And hot.

09:15.655 --> 09:16.655
[chuckles]

09:18.725 --> 09:19.824
Which is why

09:19.893 --> 09:22.127
I don't believe in the humidex
or the wind chill.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.595
Temperature is temperature.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.830
Everything else
is just media spin.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.732
So, that's why
you wearing sweater?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.201
Oh! I am so hot.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.271
Morning, Janet.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.774
-Hi, Mr. Chin.
-[Mr. Chin] Ah, Janet!

09:36.342 --> 09:37.909
Now that's a sensible outfit.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.844
[Janet] You know, I thought
about what you said

09:40.080 --> 09:42.347
about using people's things
without their permission?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.616
And... you were right.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.785
Yeah, I know.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.355
Next time, I'll ask
before I take something.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.823
See? You learning.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.692
[Mr. Chin] Takes a big person
to admit they were wrong.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.827
Or uncomfortably warm.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.129
I believe
this also belongs to you.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.667
But I didn't take it.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.035
Gerald found it...

10:05.238 --> 10:06.171
in his bed.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.808
Yeah? Okay. Thank you.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.644
Why would you take your sock off
in Gerald's bed, Appa?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.914
What? It's a crime
to walk barefoot?

10:15.982 --> 10:19.184
No. But how did your sock
get into Gerald's duvet cover?

10:19.852 --> 10:21.720
I can think of
several explanations.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.389
Maybe Gerald has a sock fetish.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.892
Or maybe Gerald
had a piece of double-sided tape

10:27.960 --> 10:29.227
stuck to his own sock,

10:29.696 --> 10:31.863
then picked up your father's
sock without knowing.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.898
[Janet] Okay, technically,
those are possibilities,

10:34.401 --> 10:37.568
but I think something else

10:37.637 --> 10:38.703
might have happened.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.739
What, Janet?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.976
Um... It's just...

10:46.946 --> 10:48.379
You and Umma...

10:48.448 --> 10:49.381
Janet!

10:49.749 --> 10:51.549
You think I and your Umma?

10:51.617 --> 10:53.718
How you can even think
thing like that?

10:54.387 --> 10:56.421
It just seemed very odd.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.922
We is you parent, Janet!

10:58.225 --> 10:59.891
See? No respect.

11:00.727 --> 11:01.693
Sorry.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.594
[Mr. Chin]
I have a third theory,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.097
but it would require me
to take off this sweater.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.303
[Kimchee] I'll just print
your receipts.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.304
Great.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.243
Oh. Forgot to choose
the printer.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.412
Looking for printers...

11:21.481 --> 11:23.247
I don't think the power's on.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.949
Oh! You know what?
I don't need a receipt.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.451
-[Kimchee] Ah!
We'll email it to you.
-[woman] Sure.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.519
Poor guy.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.020
-I guess you heard, huh?
-Yeah.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.488
My phone was blowing up
at the wedding.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.157
Right in the middle
of Alejandro's song.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.925
[Jung] Hey,
just out of curiosity,

11:33.993 --> 11:35.260
what exactly did you hear?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.795
Oh, everything until the chorus,
then he just completely lost it.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.997
I meant about Kimchee.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.466
Oh. I heard that you
kept pressuring him

11:41.468 --> 11:43.134
to let you help
with the presentation,

11:43.136 --> 11:44.869
he kept saying no,
got mad at you,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.804
then you ran over his foot
with a car.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.239
Then you did the presentation,

11:48.307 --> 11:49.440
it went super-well,

11:49.509 --> 11:52.010
and now Kimchee
has a badly sprained ankle.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.145
I also moved
a bunch of cars, but, yeah.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.647
[chuckles] Jung, I know you,
but to anyone else

11:56.716 --> 11:58.916
it would sound so much
like you sabotaged Kimchee

11:58.985 --> 12:01.352
and stole his moment,
but I know you didn't.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.190
-Did you?
-No! I would never.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.792
-Right?
-Right. [chuckles]

12:12.966 --> 12:15.133
<i> Hal-Abeoji,</i> so dusty.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.135
Oh! That's just your face.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.604
-[Appa]<i> Yobo.</i>
-Want some tea?

12:20.039 --> 12:22.240
-Janet know what we doing.
-What?

12:22.308 --> 12:24.275
Gerald find my sock
in water bed.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.077
Why you take off sock
in first place?

12:26.145 --> 12:28.480
Oh, I can't do with sock on.
No traction.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.815
-What you tell her?
-Nothing.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.651
Then, no problem. We stop doing.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.787
Yeah. Too dangerous.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.822
Yeah. Somebody might catch us.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.128
[Appa] Big wave coming in!

12:43.629 --> 12:47.131
[Umma] Oh, no!
Must be high tide.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.266
[Appa] Oh! [laughs]

12:48.268 --> 12:49.868
-Oh.
-What?

12:50.336 --> 12:51.736
You have "accident"?

12:52.371 --> 12:53.805
No. Oh!

12:55.342 --> 12:57.275
-You have "accident"?
-No.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.678
-Ooh.
-Oh!

13:00.747 --> 13:02.547
-Look like bed have accident!
-Oh!

13:02.882 --> 13:04.048
-[groans]
-Yeah.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.817
Still have time!
But have to hurry, huh?

13:05.885 --> 13:07.318
No,<i> Yobo,</i> no! Have to fix.

13:07.386 --> 13:08.319
-Oh!
-Have to fix!

13:09.255 --> 13:10.388
It looks great in here.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.056
Yeah, I cleaned.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.625
Scrubbed the shelves,
threw out the old food.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.993
I brought those muffins
this morning.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.561
Yeah, but they
were kind of fatty.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.497
Hey, you think
I'm a good guy, right?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.199
Well, not about the muffins,
but, yeah.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.968
It's just so weird,
the accident.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.170
I mean, I was checking
the mirrors and everything,

13:26.173 --> 13:28.973
but it's like Kimchee
came out of nowhere.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.676
-Huh.
-What?

13:32.011 --> 13:33.978
No, nothing. I'm just
clearing my throat, but, huh!

13:35.281 --> 13:37.182
-You think he was faking it?
-Oh, yeah.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.083
I used to work
for an insurance adjuster,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.418
and this happened all the time.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.688
No. I can't believe that Kimchee
would hurt himself on purpose.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.057
Maybe, he wasn't hurt at all.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.792
It's an old worker's comp scam.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.361
The doctor seemed reluctant
to give him an air cast.

13:50.930 --> 13:51.896
He wouldn't do that to me.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.699
Just like you'd never
hit him with a car.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.367
Or throw away my muffins.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.370
So, how would you expose
the frauds?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.272
You'd catch them in the act.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.341
I found the tray,
but there's no muffins.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.010
Huh. That's weird.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.413
Is it?

14:09.715 --> 14:11.049
[chuckles] It is, isn't it?

14:13.219 --> 14:14.485
[Appa] So much water!

14:14.487 --> 14:15.653
So many sockette.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.455
-[door opens, closes]
-[Gerald whistling]

14:19.859 --> 14:20.792
What do we do?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.063
Get out of here, you raccoon!

14:25.331 --> 14:26.898
Crazy raccoon! Get out of here!

14:26.900 --> 14:28.366
Ooh! What's going on?

14:28.434 --> 14:31.402
Crazy raccoon come in, make hole
in your bed, and then run away.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.837
Yeah. Yeah!

14:32.905 --> 14:34.272
[Umma] Yeah.
We try to stop leak.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.506
What are you guys doing here?

14:35.508 --> 14:37.441
Uh, came to get drill.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.910
But Janet returned it to you.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.112
Yeah. But, uh,
some pieces missing.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.313
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.315
Yeah. Okay, well.
Have a good day.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.416
[Umma] Okay!

14:45.418 --> 14:46.951
Uh, leftover in fridge.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.420
Uh. Um...

14:49.488 --> 14:50.421
[phone rings]

14:53.559 --> 14:55.459
Aw. Sorry about your foot.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.461
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

14:58.497 --> 14:59.630
I can't believe
he would do this.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.299
He isn't even using
the crutches.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.800
Looks like you just need
a manager's signature,

15:02.802 --> 15:05.469
which, as a manager,
I happen to be amazing at.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.570
[employee chuckles]

15:06.639 --> 15:07.739
Did you see that?

15:07.807 --> 15:09.474
He just put weight on his foot
and he didn't even flinch.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.775
What else is he lying about?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.277
Let's find out.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.580
Hey, Kimch. Again, so sorry.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.581
Ah. Don't worry man.
I'll be fine.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.850
-[groans]
-Aw.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.284
I thought it was getting better?

15:20.286 --> 15:23.054
Yeah. It flares up
when I'm tired,
or talk about it too much.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.589
You're brave, dude.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.157
Well, I should go.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.425
Time to feed the file monster.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.160
-Here! Let me get your crutches.
-Thanks.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.028
-It's just one thing...
-What's that?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.130
-I don't think you need them.
-[Kimchee gasps]

15:33.166 --> 15:34.132
[groans]

15:34.367 --> 15:35.667
What are you doing?

15:36.202 --> 15:37.301
Terence said he was faking.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.636
He used to be
an insurance adjuster.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.172
For like a week. I got fired.
I was terrible at it.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.807
-I think my elbow's broken.
-Oh!

15:42.875 --> 15:44.842
You, in the floral dress,
call 911!

15:44.910 --> 15:46.311
-It's Shannon,
you can say Shannon.
-[Kimchee groans]

15:46.779 --> 15:48.046
Guys, I think
he's seriously hurt.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.648
Melissa, we need
a mid-size SUV, stat!

15:50.716 --> 15:52.717
-Uh, that's not my name.
-I said stat!

15:53.052 --> 15:54.485
[groaning]

15:54.554 --> 15:55.520
[horns honking]

15:57.123 --> 15:58.289
[streetcar bell dinging]

15:59.058 --> 16:00.057
You want to return it?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.694
Yeah. It's not
what I thought it was.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.696
Okay.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.831
[cash register dings]

16:10.737 --> 16:11.836
[door opens]

16:12.571 --> 16:14.105
-Oh, hi, Janet.
-[Janet] Hi.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.474
Oh! Hm.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.042
-[door opens]
-[Appa clears throat]

16:18.110 --> 16:20.044
Oh, hi, Appa.
I thought you was home.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.081
No. But, uh, yeah.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.317
'Cause I am. [clears throat]

16:27.987 --> 16:29.587
[whispers] Don't look at card.
I'm looking at card.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.655
[whispers] Just be cool.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.023
You're not fooling anyone.

16:33.859 --> 16:34.892
What?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.928
You did the same staggered
entrance yesterday.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.798
Not same. This time
I come first. Okay. Good night.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.133
[Appa clears throat]

16:42.935 --> 16:43.901
[Janet] Stop.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.037
I heard from Gerald.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.606
About the "raccoons".

16:49.776 --> 16:51.942
Yeah. We just fine. No scratch.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.944
Thank you. [clears throat]

16:53.446 --> 16:54.678
I know...

16:54.747 --> 16:56.214
what you were really doing.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.385
Oh, yeah, Janet?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.586
Well, if you know what we doing,

17:02.655 --> 17:04.121
why don't you just say--

17:04.190 --> 17:05.890
You were having sex
in Gerald's water bed.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.795
Sit.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.430
-I don't want to--
-Sit!

17:13.032 --> 17:13.965
You, too!

17:14.600 --> 17:17.134
After you tormented me
about respect

17:17.137 --> 17:18.602
and personal property,

17:18.605 --> 17:19.604
you do this?

17:20.005 --> 17:21.005
What were you thinking?

17:21.073 --> 17:22.640
-I don't know.
-Because you weren't thinking.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.375
So, here's
what's going to happen.

17:24.610 --> 17:27.845
First, it's never
going to happen again.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.447
-Well, not there, anyway--
-Second,

17:30.016 --> 17:32.116
I'm not going to make you
apologize to Gerald

17:32.184 --> 17:34.352
because at least someone
should get to enjoy

17:34.420 --> 17:36.287
not picturing it every time
they close their eyes.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.623
And you are going to buy
Gerald new sheets.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.560
And a new duvet.
And a new water bed.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.928
What? No fair.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.830
Where are we
going to find a water bed?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.832
It's not 1989, Janet.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.934
Yeah. Welcome to future, Janet.

17:50.002 --> 17:52.136
If there is only one water bed
left on earth,

17:52.204 --> 17:53.838
you will find it
and buy it for Gerald!

17:55.674 --> 17:57.274
Now hand over the keys,

17:57.277 --> 17:59.744
and we will never
speak of this again.

18:01.648 --> 18:02.647
[Appa sighs]

18:07.520 --> 18:09.854
You know, it's funny
when you think about,

18:10.656 --> 18:13.624
whole time, I try
to teach you about respect.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.327
But, in a lots of way, it turns
out you teach me ab--

18:16.395 --> 18:18.496
-You're not keeping the keys.
<i> -Aeeshcham.</i>

18:24.303 --> 18:25.937
Hey, buddy. You home?

18:30.410 --> 18:31.943
Finished all your work for you.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.011
Not as good as you would have.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.782
I made some mistakes.
On purpose.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.650
[keys clatter]

18:54.466 --> 18:55.633
[sighs]

19:03.443 --> 19:04.442
[Kimchee urinating]

19:16.723 --> 19:17.722
[switch flicks]

19:18.958 --> 19:20.224
Oh. Hey, Jung.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.794
So, I watched you walk
from your room, to the bathroom,

19:23.863 --> 19:26.597
didn't flush, didn't wash your
hands, then you walked back.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.933
What part of that
offends you the most?

19:29.001 --> 19:32.236
Probably the part
where it seemed like
you were walking really well.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.005
Fine. I faked it.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.407
-I knew it!
-But I really did hurt my arm!

19:36.409 --> 19:38.009
That's 'cause you faked
hurting your leg.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.411
-[sighs] Sorry, man.
-I just don't get it.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.879
I don't know.
People look at you,

19:41.947 --> 19:45.015
and they're like,
"Yeah, okay, definitely."

19:45.084 --> 19:46.550
And they look at me
and they're like,

19:46.619 --> 19:48.619
"Okay, maybe, I don't know."

19:48.621 --> 19:51.088
-That's not true.
-Yeah, it is. Definitely.

19:51.457 --> 19:54.025
-Okay. Maybe.
-See? Like that.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.229
Look, I know I'm good at,
like, 90% of my job.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.930
But I hate presentations.

20:00.233 --> 20:03.334
And with you going on and on
about how much
you killed it last year--

20:03.402 --> 20:04.602
Slayed it. But yeah.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.103
Took the easy way out.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.739
I don't know how easy it was,
but, I get it.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.875
I shouldn't have left
such big shoes for you to fill.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.977
I'm just happy you're not hurt.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.246
I am. You sprained my elbow.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.314
Yeah. Sorry.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.316
Me, too.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.887
Did you at least
rinse your hands?

20:23.189 --> 20:24.789
Don't ruin this moment.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.798
Super generous of your parents
to give me all this stuff.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.466
I was just
going to use duct tape.

20:35.534 --> 20:37.235
Well, they did scare
the raccoons.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.270
Yeah. The raccoons.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.539
That's weird, right?

20:41.874 --> 20:43.941
That the raccoons
just snuck into my room

20:43.943 --> 20:45.476
and messed around on my bed.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.878
You know, I hear their hands
are actually a lot
like human hands.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.814
Okay, Gerald, my parents
had sex in your bed!

20:51.150 --> 20:53.284
-What?
-Isn't that
what you were getting at?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.820
No. Not, like, at all.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.789
-Oh.
-But I guess
that makes sense, right?

20:58.857 --> 21:01.158
Because everybody needs to shake
things up once in a while.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.260
Actually, Chelsea doesn't love
the water bed,

21:03.329 --> 21:05.362
so, sometimes,
while you're away, we use--

21:05.365 --> 21:06.931
A hotel? Please say a hotel.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.333
I wish that's what
I was about to say.

21:10.869 --> 21:12.136
I'll be taking these.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.171
It's really not that often.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.540
[stutters] Like, just when she
forgets her Gravol, basically--

21:16.608 --> 21:17.642
I don't want to know!

21:19.712 --> 21:21.579
Oh. Hey! Your other sock.

21:22.881 --> 21:24.815
