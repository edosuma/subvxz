00:01.415 --> 00:06.385
-

01:16.697 --> 01:18.216
Mom.

01:26.431 --> 01:27.708
Mom.

01:27.777 --> 01:29.330
Are you out here?

01:32.989 --> 01:34.611
Carly.

01:38.408 --> 01:39.478
Help me.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
Carly.

01:48.004 --> 01:49.454
Mom.

01:52.802 --> 01:54.355
Carly.

02:09.474 --> 02:11.131
Mom, are you in here?

02:12.442 --> 02:14.030
Help me.

02:16.481 --> 02:17.482
Mom.

02:33.014 --> 02:34.257
Carly.

02:37.847 --> 02:38.882
I'm here.

02:41.816 --> 02:43.404
Just a little further.

02:43.473 --> 02:44.888
I'm here.

02:55.796 --> 02:57.246
Mom.

02:58.868 --> 03:01.629
-Oh, sweetheart.
-What are you doing?

03:01.698 --> 03:07.014
Don't you see what you're
standing in?

03:11.950 --> 03:16.817
-

03:16.886 --> 03:19.578
-

04:29.683 --> 04:34.653
What the hell, Martin?

04:42.799 --> 04:45.388
-Girl.
- Wine o'clock?

04:45.457 --> 04:47.459
Damn right.
I wanna see the place.

04:47.528 --> 04:49.565
I'm, uh, I'm on my way.
Just send me the address.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.877
-Okay, see you soon.
-Bye.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.372
What?

05:09.964 --> 05:11.000
All right.

05:12.139 --> 05:13.830
I have to admit, I was
beginning to wonder

05:13.899 --> 05:15.418
what the hell I was doing
back here,

05:15.487 --> 05:16.971
but this is what makes it
worth it.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.076
Hi.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.251
-Too long.
-Look at you.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.253
Let me take a look at you.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.772
-You look like shit.
-

05:24.841 --> 05:26.498
What's going on?

05:26.567 --> 05:28.328
Good to see you, too, big city.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.468
Check out my workspace.
It's up here.

05:30.537 --> 05:33.091
Hang on.
Are you working here
or house sitting?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.127
-A little of both.
-Okay.

05:35.196 --> 05:36.819
I mean, if the designs I submit
get accepted,

05:36.888 --> 05:39.753
-then can turn into
a long term thing.
-

05:39.822 --> 05:41.893
Not the house,
obviously.

05:45.068 --> 05:47.105
I'm so happy
you're back, pal.

05:48.175 --> 05:51.385
Am I really having
another? I am, aren't I?

05:51.454 --> 05:54.837
-I am having
another piece. Yeah.
-It's so good.

05:54.906 --> 05:56.873
So what else is going?
I mean, catch me up.

05:56.942 --> 05:58.427
-What have I missed?
-

05:59.911 --> 06:01.568
I got a text from Martin.

06:02.707 --> 06:04.329
-Martin?
-Yeah.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.677
-Really?
-Yeah, just, uh, just before
I came over.

06:08.851 --> 06:12.095
-Wow.
-I mean, I haven't spoken to him
since,

06:12.751 --> 06:15.167
God, it must be like six
or seven years now.

06:15.236 --> 06:16.686
I don't know.

06:16.755 --> 06:18.274
Yeah.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.034
-Did you text him back?
-No.

06:20.103 --> 06:22.382
I can't go near any of that
anymore.

06:22.451 --> 06:23.486
You know?

06:24.211 --> 06:26.869
Good. No one needs to hear
his insane theories

06:26.938 --> 06:29.354
after everything that happened
with your mother.

06:29.423 --> 06:33.634
I don't know that I was that
good at listening to you

06:34.532 --> 06:36.326
after all the shit
you went through.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.984
You were just fine, okay?

06:39.951 --> 06:44.473
But this is way too heavy
for one glass of wine.

06:44.542 --> 06:47.821
-Easily fixed.
-

06:47.890 --> 06:51.134
No, no, no.
I'm, uh, I'm driving.

06:51.203 --> 06:54.862
And I actually should get going.

06:54.931 --> 06:56.519
-You're kidding?
-I know.

06:56.588 --> 06:57.555
-You just got here.
-I know.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.108
I've got you back now.

06:59.177 --> 07:02.076
We can do this like
so many times over.

07:02.145 --> 07:03.595
Okay.

07:03.664 --> 07:05.148
Thank you.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.429
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.928
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:36.619 --> 08:39.898
I didn't know what to get you,
but I remembered you always
loved Coke so I got you a Coke.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.003
Thanks.

08:44.420 --> 08:46.042
How are you doing?

08:46.111 --> 08:48.286
How are you-- how are you
holding up and stuff?

08:49.805 --> 08:53.705
I'm all right.
I got a job assembling
truck bodies.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.569
Keeps me busy.
Welding.

08:55.638 --> 08:58.952
Are you still at the same house
on the bench?

08:59.021 --> 09:00.056
Yeah.

09:01.161 --> 09:02.196
It's nice there.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.822
So what's the deal?

09:08.237 --> 09:13.207
So a few days ago I got a call
from this medical tech company
on the valley.

09:13.276 --> 09:18.247
Uh, they offered me
some money to be part of like
a focus group.

09:18.316 --> 09:20.663
So I went and when I got there,

09:20.732 --> 09:23.977
there were all these real
actual hospital patients.

09:24.046 --> 09:26.289
What?
That's fucked up.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.879
Yeah, but the patient was
your mom, Carly.

09:31.053 --> 09:32.468
I mean, it was Angela.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.368
And they knew that I knew her
somehow.

09:36.437 --> 09:38.025
I mean, I didn't find that out
until I got there.

09:38.094 --> 09:41.650
Wait. What?
She's in a clinic?
Is she sick?

09:43.444 --> 09:45.377
Carly, she's in a coma.

09:45.446 --> 09:48.104
I mean, she's fully paralyzed.

09:48.173 --> 09:50.935
-A coma, what happened?
-I don't know. They didn't say.

09:51.004 --> 09:52.937
It looked like correctional
services brought her up there.

09:53.006 --> 09:54.939
I mean, she's still like
a felon or whatever, right,

09:55.008 --> 09:58.943
but she's being allowed
to be a patient

09:59.012 --> 10:00.807
in this medical research thing.

10:04.949 --> 10:06.088
Did you actually see her?

10:07.537 --> 10:11.196
Yeah.
The second I recognized her,
I left, but yeah.

10:11.265 --> 10:12.612
Ugh.

10:14.372 --> 10:18.479
They wanted
your contact information,
but I didn't give it to them.

10:18.548 --> 10:20.274
I don't think that they know
that you changed your last name

10:20.343 --> 10:21.655
but they're gonna find you.

10:27.488 --> 10:29.629
I'm sorry things got so weird
between us.

10:31.354 --> 10:33.391
And I understand why you got
so angry, I do.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.048
-Like, I get it.
-It's fine.

10:35.117 --> 10:36.359
You don't have to apologize.

10:39.017 --> 10:40.847
It was just,
it was hard for me then.

10:42.158 --> 10:45.058
Didn't wanna hear all that
stuff, okay?

10:45.127 --> 10:46.162
We're cool.

11:42.253 --> 11:47.258
-

11:57.233 --> 11:59.995
-Hello.
- Is this a Miss Spencer?

12:00.064 --> 12:03.792
-Yeah, that's me.
-Hi, my name is Michael Dolos
from Therapol.

12:03.861 --> 12:05.966
-I know who you are.
-Okay.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.486
My friend Martin told me you
called.

12:08.555 --> 12:11.178
Yes, your mother, Angela,
she's our patient.

12:11.247 --> 12:13.215
I'm just wondering if you would
perhaps be open

12:13.284 --> 12:15.562
to coming in to visit with her.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.601
She's not doing too well
unfortunately.

12:24.295 --> 12:25.296
Miss Spencer?

12:28.644 --> 12:29.679
Uh, yeah, I'm here.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.063
What happened to her?

12:34.132 --> 12:36.583
I don't understand.
Why is she in a clinic?

12:36.652 --> 12:38.930
I'm sorry, but we can't discuss
medical details

12:38.999 --> 12:42.037
of patients over the phone,
but if you come in,

12:42.106 --> 12:44.177
we can explain everything
to you.

12:45.350 --> 12:47.974
It's a very unusual
circumstance for us.

12:50.493 --> 12:51.771
Yeah, I'll do it.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.289
Okay, great. Um...

12:53.358 --> 12:54.774
Could you come in tomorrow?

12:55.705 --> 12:58.467
-Yeah, yes.
-Great, I'll text you
the address.

12:58.536 --> 13:00.572
Thank you so much,
Miss Spencer.

13:00.641 --> 13:01.815
We'll see you tomorrow.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.796
-

13:35.366 --> 13:36.746
Miss Spencer.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.438
-Morning.
-Morning.

13:38.507 --> 13:40.681
I'm Michael. We spoke last night
on the phone.

13:40.750 --> 13:43.132
Thank you, uh, so much
for coming in today.

13:43.201 --> 13:44.478
I do appreciate it.

13:44.547 --> 13:45.755
Let me take you inside.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.899
Uh, what--
what is this place?

13:50.968 --> 13:52.762
Therapol is a new company.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.143
Medical imaging industry.

13:54.212 --> 13:56.766
Some of our funding is
governmental.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.976
Some of it's private.

13:59.045 --> 14:01.150
We develop cutting-edge
technology here

14:01.219 --> 14:05.292
to try and alleviate suffering
in patients.

14:05.361 --> 14:07.156
At least that's our goal.

14:07.225 --> 14:08.951
A lot of the technology
is so new,

14:09.020 --> 14:11.436
it doesn't really even exist.

14:11.505 --> 14:12.748
Someone is building it.

14:16.269 --> 14:17.270
Right this way.

14:21.757 --> 14:22.758
After you.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.519
Please, uh, just have a seat.

14:28.246 --> 14:29.385
This is Daniel.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.353
He's our lead researcher here.

14:31.422 --> 14:34.045
-Hi.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

14:34.114 --> 14:37.877
Daniel is a PhD in two fields,

14:37.946 --> 14:40.880
biomedical imaging
and neurology.

14:40.949 --> 14:43.123
Okay, and, uh, and you?

14:43.192 --> 14:45.470
I'm a physician primarily.

14:45.539 --> 14:47.887
Anyway, thank you for coming in.

14:47.956 --> 14:52.029
We know it's not an ideal
situation.

14:52.098 --> 14:53.616
Our lab has a relationship
with hospitals

14:53.685 --> 14:55.032
and prisons all over the country

14:55.101 --> 14:57.827
for possible candidates
for our research.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.071
Very specific requirements.

15:00.934 --> 15:01.970
Yeah, uh...

15:02.832 --> 15:05.490
I've been out of touch with her
for a very long time.

15:06.353 --> 15:09.494
I don't know much about
what's happened to her
over the years,

15:09.563 --> 15:13.809
but Martin, who you met,
said she's in a coma.

15:13.878 --> 15:16.087
Is that... is that accurate?

15:17.123 --> 15:19.228
Yes, sadly.

15:19.297 --> 15:20.850
Her syndrome is very rare.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.993
It's called LIS or locked-in
syndrome.

15:25.062 --> 15:27.719
Typically the patient is
completely aware,

15:27.788 --> 15:31.068
but they are unable
to move at all due to
complete paralysis

15:31.137 --> 15:33.725
of all voluntary muscles
in the body.

15:33.794 --> 15:36.211
Why?
I mean, what happened?

15:36.280 --> 15:41.078
Well, in your mother's case,
it appears to be the result of
a brain injury, head trauma.

15:41.147 --> 15:44.426
She had an episode in prison
apparently.

15:44.495 --> 15:46.773
Her case of pseudocoma
is very unusual.

15:46.842 --> 15:48.671
She's unable to breathe
on her own.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.087
She can't even move her eyes.

15:50.156 --> 15:51.881
So it's a total locked-in state.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.919
But her mind is very active.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.577
She just won't communicate
with us in the simulation,

15:57.646 --> 15:58.819
except to ask for you.

15:59.682 --> 16:00.994
Uh, simulation?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.894
Yes. That's why we asked you
to come in.

16:05.516 --> 16:06.966
Think of what we're
building here

16:07.035 --> 16:10.728
as kind of a second reality
for all your senses.

16:10.797 --> 16:13.144
Your thoughts, like where to
move your hand,

16:13.213 --> 16:15.664
are driven by your motor cortex.

16:15.733 --> 16:19.806
We redirect these impulses
to a digital version of you

16:19.875 --> 16:23.327
and in that virtual space,
you will meet your mother.

16:24.535 --> 16:27.572
But you have to think of it as
stepping into someone's mind.

16:27.641 --> 16:28.953
Into her mind.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.266
It can be very confusing
for the outsider

16:31.335 --> 16:34.303
because a piece of one place,
one memory,

16:34.372 --> 16:38.583
might be inserted into another,
kind of like a dream.

16:38.652 --> 16:41.379
-Make sense?
- Um...

16:43.554 --> 16:48.524
We should let you know, too,
we are aware of your mother's
convictions.

16:50.112 --> 16:52.183
We can certainly appreciate
how complicated

16:52.252 --> 16:54.013
the relationship might be
for you.

16:55.324 --> 16:57.292
To know that our research
is making a difference,

16:57.361 --> 16:59.501
we need to know how she's doing
on the inside,

16:59.570 --> 17:01.779
if it's making life better
for her.

17:03.677 --> 17:06.404
So, you want me to communicate
with her?

17:07.267 --> 17:08.648
Get her to open up
as much as possible.

17:08.717 --> 17:10.098
See how she's doing.

17:10.167 --> 17:11.651
We wanna know if there's
anything we can do

17:11.720 --> 17:13.411
to make her life more
comfortable.

17:16.759 --> 17:18.692
All right, let's get started.

17:23.904 --> 17:26.873
Okay, this capture
will represent how you look
in the simulation.

17:26.942 --> 17:28.530
So just stand there with your
arms out, please,

17:28.599 --> 17:29.979
like in a "T" pose.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.774
-Yeah, okay.
-Great.

17:31.843 --> 17:32.879
Okay.

17:33.742 --> 17:35.985
Three, two, one.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.541
Okay.

17:39.610 --> 17:44.615
-

17:54.866 --> 17:56.282
Carly, uh, wait.

17:57.593 --> 18:01.839
Before you go in, remember your
mother's in a bad state.

18:01.908 --> 18:03.254
I don't want you to be shocked.

18:03.323 --> 18:05.498
It can be a real shock
for a family member

18:05.567 --> 18:08.156
who hasn't seen something
like this before.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.823
-

18:38.427 --> 18:39.428
Oh, my God.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.605
Prison guards reported her
becoming more

18:43.674 --> 18:45.538
and more violent over the years.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.299
Self harming.

18:48.368 --> 18:50.439
Episodes of psychotic
hallucinations.

18:52.648 --> 18:55.064
Until eventually she sustained
the brain injury.

18:58.067 --> 18:59.690
Carly, you'll be lying
over here.

19:01.312 --> 19:03.659
-

19:03.728 --> 19:05.005
Take your shoes off,
please,

19:05.074 --> 19:07.076
and you can leave your things
down here.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.359
Okay. You can turn to me.

19:14.808 --> 19:17.086
Now this will read and transmit
directly

19:17.156 --> 19:18.743
to your brain in the sim, okay?

19:19.710 --> 19:21.194
Is that too tight?

19:21.263 --> 19:23.852
-Okay, just lie back.
-No, that's good. Okay.

19:26.199 --> 19:30.203
We'll be monitoring everything
from a control room.
Make sure you're okay.

19:30.272 --> 19:34.518
Uh, wait. When I'm inside,
can I communicate with you?

19:34.587 --> 19:38.729
Yes, we can hear and see you,
but you cannot hear us

19:39.557 --> 19:43.251
or if you ask, we'll pull you
right out immediately, okay?

19:43.320 --> 19:44.666
Okay.

20:11.727 --> 20:12.866
Okay, Carly.

20:12.935 --> 20:14.868
Just take a deep breath in.

20:14.937 --> 20:17.630
And we're about to drop you
into the simulation, okay?

20:22.428 --> 20:23.532
Okay, close your eyes.

20:23.601 --> 20:28.572
And three, two, one.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.993
Okay, looking good.

20:36.062 --> 20:37.788
And she's dropping in.

21:28.010 --> 21:29.460
Oh, my God.

22:07.705 --> 22:11.813
How is this possible?

23:05.798 --> 23:09.802
-

23:13.564 --> 23:14.565
Angela.

23:17.603 --> 23:19.121
It's me. It's...

23:19.190 --> 23:20.226
It's Carly, your...

23:22.366 --> 23:23.402
It's Carly.

23:25.507 --> 23:27.647
I debated whether I should
come here at all.

23:30.374 --> 23:31.548
I didn't wanna see you.

23:34.343 --> 23:38.106
Actually, I didn't wanna
see you ever again.

23:40.764 --> 23:42.075
I decided that long ago.

23:44.181 --> 23:45.665
But then I realized something.

23:48.150 --> 23:50.429
I never got a chance to tell you

23:52.327 --> 23:53.742
how much I hate you.

23:57.677 --> 23:59.161
So that's why I'm here.

24:02.026 --> 24:05.513
I came here to tell you how
fucking disgusting you are.

24:13.624 --> 24:17.594
And now I know you can die
having heard exactly how I feel.

24:19.768 --> 24:22.840
Carly, I knew that.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.156
And now I need you to leave.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.297
You have to go.

24:31.366 --> 24:32.401
What?

24:34.887 --> 24:36.302
You want me to leave you?

24:38.338 --> 24:40.202
Turn and look at me, Angela.

24:41.410 --> 24:44.206
I don't want to look
at you.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.208
I don't want to endanger you.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.038
Look at me.

24:48.107 --> 24:50.419
Turn and look at me.

25:03.122 --> 25:04.848
You're so beautiful,

25:07.057 --> 25:08.990
but now you have to go.

25:10.888 --> 25:14.098
Go, sweetheart, please.
You can hate me.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.721
Go, go, go.

25:15.790 --> 25:18.689
Yeah, okay, yeah, well,
that's just perfect.

25:18.758 --> 25:21.278
It's just perfect.
That's better than I could've
imagined.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.110
You've really outdone yourself,
Angela.

25:26.179 --> 25:27.456
You go.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.941
Go and don't you come back.

25:29.010 --> 25:30.839
Don't ever come back.
You hear me?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.152
-Go.
-You know what?

25:33.221 --> 25:34.809
-Fuck you.
-Get her out.

25:34.878 --> 25:36.189
She could be beyond her
threshold.

25:36.258 --> 25:37.984
Yeah.

25:49.651 --> 25:51.308
How did she seem to you?
-Sorry, sorry, guys.

25:51.377 --> 25:52.447
I just need a second.

25:53.690 --> 25:55.899
The whole thing's just a bit
of a shock.

26:09.395 --> 26:11.086
She seemed, um...

26:13.261 --> 26:14.400
I don't know.

26:15.712 --> 26:19.232
Same as she's always been
I suppose. Uh...

26:21.476 --> 26:24.065
I don't know, disconnected.
Crazy.

26:26.792 --> 26:29.760
Where did she place you?
Um, where was the simulation?

26:30.968 --> 26:33.246
It was, uh,
my childhood home.

26:35.317 --> 26:38.286
Some stuff was wrong.
Off slightly.

26:39.321 --> 26:41.565
Yeah, that's how she
remembers it.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.533
Did she seem like
she was in any pain at all?

26:44.603 --> 26:49.366
We didn't hear her mention
anything relating to her
condition.

26:49.435 --> 26:52.576
Feeling trapped,
claustrophobic, out of body
experiences.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.613
No, I don't think so.

26:54.682 --> 26:57.201
She was younger, though.

26:58.513 --> 27:01.792
Like around the same time as
when she went to prison.

27:01.861 --> 27:04.933
The age regression is a coping
mechanism for Angela.

27:05.002 --> 27:07.764
It seemed like a very
informative first meeting,
though.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.628
Hmm.
-Wait, first?

27:09.697 --> 27:11.768
Well, we would like you
to do another.

27:11.837 --> 27:15.323
No.
- Carly, um...

27:15.392 --> 27:20.397
You're a smart woman and I'm
not gonna try and bullshit you.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.813
The only reason you came here
today

27:23.918 --> 27:26.368
was to simply tell her
how you feel.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.473
Am I correct?

27:31.270 --> 27:34.066
Anger, right?

27:34.135 --> 27:36.240
What's under that anger?

27:36.309 --> 27:37.345
You're hurt.

27:38.967 --> 27:40.969
Understandably, you're confused.

27:42.074 --> 27:44.317
Your mother went on a homicidal
rampage.

27:44.386 --> 27:48.218
She left you
almost two decades ago.

27:50.013 --> 27:51.048
Why?

27:52.360 --> 27:53.637
Ask her these questions.

27:53.706 --> 27:54.811
This is your chance.

28:31.261 --> 28:33.263
-Shit.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.760
-

29:31.424 --> 29:33.530
Carly.

29:33.599 --> 29:35.014
Mom.

29:39.916 --> 29:41.710
I can't.

29:46.854 --> 29:48.372
Fuck, okay.

30:00.488 --> 30:01.938
Carly!

30:12.534 --> 30:15.503
-Carly, Carly, Carly, Carly.

30:16.711 --> 30:19.369
-

30:52.851 --> 30:55.163
Thank you for coming in again.

30:55.232 --> 30:57.683
I know it must be really
difficult.

30:57.752 --> 30:58.787
Thanks.

30:59.478 --> 31:02.170
Okay, just lay back.

31:21.914 --> 31:25.642
How is she?
- Okay. For now,
I think.

31:28.576 --> 31:31.268
Okay, Carly.
You ready?

31:32.062 --> 31:36.411
-Yeah.
-All right, dropping you in
in three,

31:36.480 --> 31:39.414
-two, one.
-

32:07.063 --> 32:08.064
Angela.

32:09.237 --> 32:10.238
It's me again.

32:11.170 --> 32:12.447
It's Carly.

32:22.526 --> 32:26.392
Oh, my God.

32:36.299 --> 32:38.128
What the hell is that?

32:39.543 --> 32:42.443
Can you guys see that?
What is it?

32:43.513 --> 32:45.894
No, no, no.
Let her decide.

32:47.103 --> 32:48.104
Angela?

32:49.519 --> 32:52.453
-

33:43.676 --> 33:44.712
Angela.

33:46.403 --> 33:47.439
Why are you here?

33:48.233 --> 33:50.718
Because this is where
it gets its power.

33:53.341 --> 33:55.447
But now it lives in me.

33:55.516 --> 33:56.517
What lives in you?

33:58.105 --> 34:00.831
Carly, you have to go.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.109
Please go.

34:03.903 --> 34:05.836
I'm begging you.
Go, Carly, go.

34:05.905 --> 34:09.254
Angela, I came back
a second time to ask you
something.

34:09.599 --> 34:10.979
Why would you call me here?

34:11.946 --> 34:14.293
Why would you call Martin here?

34:14.362 --> 34:16.019
Why us after all these years?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.469
I didn't.

34:17.538 --> 34:19.091
It did.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.404
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

34:21.473 --> 34:22.405
Now go.

34:22.474 --> 34:24.510
Get out.

34:24.579 --> 34:26.064
Please go.

34:26.133 --> 34:31.724
You have to go.
You have to go.

34:31.793 --> 34:33.899
You have to go.
-Stop it.

34:35.383 --> 34:37.075
Stop it.
Stop doing that.

34:42.149 --> 34:44.185
You guys. Daniel, please!

34:44.254 --> 34:46.429
Please, please let me out.

34:46.498 --> 34:49.259
Michael, Daniel,
can you hear me?

34:53.436 --> 34:55.231
-Guys, let me out!
-Come on, what are we doing?

34:55.300 --> 34:58.751
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Just... just wait.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.168
Go, go, go, go, go.

35:01.823 --> 35:03.584
You have to go.
Go, go, go, go.

35:03.653 --> 35:04.930
Go, go, go, go.

35:08.968 --> 35:11.350
Where the fuck is the exit?

35:11.419 --> 35:14.077
Okay, how do I get out?
What do I do? Okay.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.010
Carly, think.
Carly, think.

35:23.259 --> 35:24.605
Carly.

35:26.365 --> 35:27.539
What?

35:42.554 --> 35:43.555
It can't be.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.075
Sam.

35:48.491 --> 35:49.906
Sam.

35:49.975 --> 35:52.564
What?
How is this possible?

35:53.979 --> 35:55.014
Sam.

35:55.877 --> 35:59.467
-No! Okay.
-

36:36.849 --> 36:41.509
-

36:41.578 --> 36:43.511
Make a left here.
Okay.

36:44.409 --> 36:45.444
Here we go.

36:46.514 --> 36:49.034
Just follow me down the hall.

36:49.103 --> 36:51.795
-

36:55.247 --> 36:57.111
What the fuck happened to me?

36:58.043 --> 36:59.389
We don't have answers.

37:01.805 --> 37:04.256
Did someone cut me
while I was under?
Did you do this to me?

37:05.568 --> 37:08.950
-No.
-Well, then why the fuck
didn't you pull me out?

37:09.399 --> 37:12.368
I asked to be pulled out.
You said you could hear me.

37:12.437 --> 37:14.266
-Is that a lie?
- Miss Spencer...

37:15.750 --> 37:17.925
Obviously we can appreciate
how upset you are.

37:17.994 --> 37:22.240
You have every right.
We just need to ask you
a few questions.

37:22.309 --> 37:24.966
She said she did not ask for us.

37:27.003 --> 37:28.729
She didn't ask for me or Martin.

37:28.798 --> 37:30.765
She did.
I can promise you that.

37:30.834 --> 37:34.873
I'm gonna try
to be brief, okay?

37:35.770 --> 37:41.293
Now, your mother took you
to a memory of a building.
What was that?

37:41.362 --> 37:45.159
I mean, in the real world,
where does this memory
come from?

37:57.205 --> 38:01.037
You said you know what Angela
was convicted of?

38:01.106 --> 38:05.213
Yes, on paper, yes,
but any information you can
give us can be helpful.

38:06.353 --> 38:08.838
Her life revolved around
nursing.

38:08.907 --> 38:09.942
She loved her job.

38:11.358 --> 38:13.567
I had a close-knit small group.

38:13.636 --> 38:15.948
Sam, my best friend,
Martin, and me.

38:16.017 --> 38:17.950
Just the three of us
neighborhood kids.

38:20.574 --> 38:25.406
Anyway, this one afternoon
we were drinking at my house

38:25.475 --> 38:28.064
because Angela was out...

38:31.516 --> 38:34.657
and I suddenly had
this feeling.

38:37.004 --> 38:38.730
Like, I can't even explain.

38:41.664 --> 38:43.700
It was like the worst feeling
in my life.

38:46.151 --> 38:47.186
What feeling?

38:47.877 --> 38:49.810
That something had happened
to her.

38:51.881 --> 38:55.471
She told me she was going
an hour north that morning

38:57.645 --> 39:03.617
to this place, a sanatorium for
tuberculosis.

39:03.686 --> 39:05.860
She was on the prevential
medical team

39:05.929 --> 39:10.348
asked to evaluate if it could
eventually be reopened.

39:12.557 --> 39:15.007
I forced Martin to drive us
there.

39:23.602 --> 39:27.572
When we got there,
we found her car abandoned,

39:28.504 --> 39:30.678
but we couldn't find her.

39:30.747 --> 39:32.266
Mom?

39:36.857 --> 39:38.514
We couldn't find her anywhere.

39:38.583 --> 39:39.963
Mom?!

39:42.794 --> 39:46.038
And we went into that
disgusting building.

39:49.835 --> 39:50.974
Mom?

39:54.944 --> 39:56.739
Mom! Hey!

39:59.397 --> 40:01.433
I see a cut.
Grab your shirt.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.819
Her arm was cut, bleeding.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.685
Like this.

40:11.754 --> 40:13.480
Exactly like this.

40:22.005 --> 40:24.076
I remember getting her home.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.251
She wouldn't talk to me.

40:28.011 --> 40:30.531
It went on like that
for a few weeks.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.601
Weeks?

40:32.844 --> 40:35.122
Yeah, she was, uh,
she was gone.

40:36.813 --> 40:37.780
Comatose.

40:47.721 --> 40:50.344
It got worse
and worse, though.

40:57.524 --> 41:00.043
Mom, I'm gonna go over
to Sam's first.

41:13.712 --> 41:16.059
Then I come home this one day

41:16.128 --> 41:20.892
and she's being loaded
into a squad car.

41:23.584 --> 41:26.138
And I remember her looking
at me.

41:30.798 --> 41:31.799
She smiled at me.

41:44.018 --> 41:49.576
-Then I found out
she'd... set fire...
-

41:49.645 --> 41:52.026
...to an old aged care home.

41:54.201 --> 41:55.789
A place she'd worked before.

42:00.828 --> 42:02.761
She killed 21 people.

42:06.662 --> 42:08.215
I'm so sorry, Carly.

42:11.045 --> 42:13.358
They also uncovered that she
poisoned people

42:15.118 --> 42:16.913
at a local church.

42:18.087 --> 42:21.711
Killed another five...
including my
grandmother.

42:23.195 --> 42:26.095
The whole town turned on me
by extension.

42:27.130 --> 42:28.684
So I made a choice that day

42:28.753 --> 42:30.444
that I would never see her
again.

42:31.790 --> 42:33.689
That I would never
speak to her.

42:38.866 --> 42:40.454
Fuck, look, I can't do this
anymore, okay?

42:40.523 --> 42:42.629
Can we just be done, please?

42:42.698 --> 42:45.839
Just one thing,
please. Um...

42:46.494 --> 42:48.876
Was there anyone else there
with you

42:48.945 --> 42:50.844
in the simulation with you
and your mother?

42:50.913 --> 42:54.123
Sam, yeah.
My friend Sam was in there.

42:54.951 --> 42:56.850
-Can I go, please?
-Yeah, of course, that's okay.

42:56.919 --> 42:58.437
That's more than enough.

42:59.024 --> 43:02.338
The building, the sanatorium,
where was that?

43:03.615 --> 43:05.341
Does it matter?

43:05.410 --> 43:07.550
-

43:17.422 --> 43:19.562
Hey, what's up, babe?

43:19.631 --> 43:22.530
Thank God.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.601
What?

43:25.741 --> 43:27.432
Sorry, I just, um...

43:28.916 --> 43:32.713
Uh, I had strange feeling
about you.

43:32.782 --> 43:35.543
-I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.
-Oh.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.961
That's a pretty fucking weird
and creepy thing to say.

43:39.030 --> 43:42.102
Yeah,
I guess you're right. It is.

43:42.171 --> 43:45.277
-Sorry.
-You okay? You sound terrible.

43:46.313 --> 43:47.348
Yeah.

43:48.522 --> 43:52.043
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I just had a really fucking
weird morning.

44:09.405 --> 44:14.410
-

44:24.800 --> 44:25.904
Hey.

44:25.973 --> 44:27.768
Uh, sorry for just showing up.

44:27.837 --> 44:29.459
But I... I need to talk to you.

44:29.528 --> 44:30.840
Can I come in?

44:30.909 --> 44:31.876
Okay.

44:33.153 --> 44:36.121
I went to see Angela
today at that clinic.

44:36.190 --> 44:37.675
You did?

44:37.744 --> 44:40.091
In the simulation,
she took me to

44:40.160 --> 44:42.680
that building
where we found her.

44:45.372 --> 44:47.926
What do you mean she took you
to that building?

44:49.617 --> 44:52.137
It's like being in
a person's memory.

44:52.206 --> 44:55.140
I found her there
in the simulation.

44:55.209 --> 44:56.245
It's like a...

44:57.522 --> 44:58.765
It's like a recreation.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.216
But I saw that place.

45:05.288 --> 45:08.844
And, Martin, I saw something
in it.

45:17.266 --> 45:18.681
You all right?

45:22.892 --> 45:27.069
Look, I just, I wanted to say
that when you came to me

45:27.138 --> 45:31.073
with all that stuff back then,
I was really harsh.

45:32.453 --> 45:34.386
You mean when you said I was
clinically insane?

45:36.354 --> 45:37.389
Yeah.

45:38.252 --> 45:40.530
You and Sam cut me off
completely.

45:40.599 --> 45:41.635
Sorry.

45:44.569 --> 45:46.502
But can you tell me again?

45:46.571 --> 45:51.162
You had like all those
handwritten notepads
with sketches.

45:51.231 --> 45:52.266
Do you remember?

45:55.649 --> 45:56.684
Yeah, I remember.

45:59.584 --> 46:02.069
After we found your mom,
it started.
I would sleepwalk.

46:02.138 --> 46:06.073
-I'd wake up in the woods
just shaking.
-Okay.

46:06.142 --> 46:07.695
I had these terrors,
these nightmares,

46:07.765 --> 46:10.284
so I would write, sketch them.

46:10.353 --> 46:12.390
That's what I kept trying
to show you.

46:12.459 --> 46:15.186
Things have gotten a lot worse
for me since then.

46:15.255 --> 46:16.877
What do you mean worse?

46:22.020 --> 46:23.781
Carly, what happened
to your arm?

46:28.130 --> 46:30.546
I don't know.

46:30.615 --> 46:33.204
It happened in the simulation.
I don't know.

46:33.273 --> 46:37.277
I can't explain it,
but it's the same as hers.

46:38.174 --> 46:39.141
So...

46:39.831 --> 46:41.868
Please, Martin, I'm so confused.

46:43.973 --> 46:45.388
Show me.

46:50.497 --> 46:53.500
Now, I've never shown anyone
this before.

47:13.589 --> 47:15.039
So this what I think
it is.

47:17.351 --> 47:18.421
Demonic possession.

47:21.079 --> 47:25.635
Out of all the research
I've done, all the bullshit
I read,

47:25.704 --> 47:29.018
this one seems like it could be
real.

47:30.123 --> 47:33.195
It's said to haunt
and torment you
for your entire life,

47:33.264 --> 47:36.060
also influencing close friends
and other family members.

47:37.993 --> 47:39.511
Accounts go back millennia.

47:40.685 --> 47:42.135
See?

47:42.204 --> 47:43.826
I think that sanitarium is built

47:43.895 --> 47:45.621
on some sort of haunted land.

47:46.933 --> 47:49.176
Now there are stories that date
back centuries

47:49.245 --> 47:51.489
that connect to this piece
of land.

47:51.558 --> 47:53.215
And everyone says
the same thing.

47:54.112 --> 47:57.219
1889.
It was a fur trading post.

47:57.288 --> 48:01.016
Accounts of bodily possessions,
murders, all documented.

48:01.602 --> 48:03.121
Hey, look at this.

48:03.190 --> 48:05.054
The first stage
of the infection.

48:05.123 --> 48:08.644
The subject makes an amulet
using parts of a raven

48:08.713 --> 48:10.611
like the one your mother made.

48:13.545 --> 48:16.894
I don't know if it was fate
or just bad luck or what,

48:19.586 --> 48:21.484
but she walked through
this thing's lair

48:21.553 --> 48:24.315
and it snatched her right up,
possessed her body.

48:25.454 --> 48:27.663
Just... just hear me out, okay?

48:27.732 --> 48:31.943
In the Catholic church
and in a lot of sects
of the Catholic church,

48:32.012 --> 48:34.842
the idea of the demons are real
is just accepted as a fact.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.844
I mean, it's not some
hypothetical "what if"

48:36.914 --> 48:38.156
like the way we talk about it.

48:38.225 --> 48:41.159
To them,
it is as real as air and water.

48:41.228 --> 48:42.505
I'm talking demons.

48:43.368 --> 48:44.576
The devil.

48:44.645 --> 48:46.026
Real.

48:48.995 --> 48:54.793
-Okay.
-So, one of the things
that I read is that the Vatican

48:54.862 --> 48:58.418
has basically been funding
a black ops unit.

48:59.453 --> 49:04.286
Very well funded
and well equipped
to hunt demons,

49:04.355 --> 49:07.634
using hand-selected priests
like soldiers.

49:07.703 --> 49:10.050
What I read is that the Vatican

49:10.119 --> 49:12.915
has been buying up places
like Therapol.

49:12.984 --> 49:15.435
And I mean exactly like
Therapol.

49:16.539 --> 49:18.058
Private hospitals.

49:18.127 --> 49:20.371
Small clinics that specialize
in disorders.

49:20.440 --> 49:22.062
Things like comas.

49:22.131 --> 49:24.064
Things that western medicine
will dismiss

49:24.133 --> 49:26.894
as being explainable
when, in fact, it could be...

49:26.964 --> 49:27.999
Possessions.

49:28.896 --> 49:31.451
I think that the doctors
at Therapol,

49:31.520 --> 49:32.728
I think they're priests.

49:34.730 --> 49:36.214
And I think they're using
technology

49:36.283 --> 49:39.562
to sniff out who's genuinely
possessed.

49:39.631 --> 49:41.840
What do they do
with the possessed people?

49:43.221 --> 49:44.222
An exorcism.

49:45.499 --> 49:48.054
Now, I think they take
the people that have been
possessed

49:48.123 --> 49:50.056
back to the original place
it happened.

49:50.953 --> 49:51.989
The demon gateway.

49:53.059 --> 49:54.750
It's the only way it gets in
or out.

49:54.819 --> 49:56.165
And I think they're gonna take
her back

49:56.234 --> 49:57.580
to the sanitarium, Carly.

50:03.034 --> 50:05.278
Are you sure that you haven't
been having

50:05.347 --> 50:07.245
any hallucinations
or any visions?

50:07.314 --> 50:09.454
And I mean outside
of the simulation,

50:09.523 --> 50:11.146
because this is what it does,
Carly.

50:11.215 --> 50:13.079
It shows you things.

50:16.979 --> 50:18.187
And it makes you do things.

50:18.256 --> 50:19.257
Yeah, okay, no.

50:19.326 --> 50:20.672
I can't do this, sorry.

50:20.741 --> 50:21.777
Carly.

50:22.674 --> 50:23.710
Carly.

50:24.538 --> 50:27.679
Just-- would you listen
to me, please?
Listen to me.

50:27.748 --> 50:30.475
If you start having visions,
that means it's--

50:33.513 --> 50:34.790
Carly!

50:38.863 --> 50:40.244
It means it's coming for ya.

51:14.830 --> 51:16.901
Hey, babe!
-Oh, what the fuck?

51:16.970 --> 51:18.420
What the fuck?

51:18.489 --> 51:20.007
Sam, Jesus.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.079
You could've killed me.
You just let yourself in?

51:22.148 --> 51:23.839
Yeah, chill out.

51:23.908 --> 51:25.910
-No, no, no.

51:25.979 --> 51:27.429
I can't do this tonight, Sam.

51:27.498 --> 51:29.155
-No, I'm sorry.
-What, no, sit down.

51:29.224 --> 51:30.742
No, I'm not gonna sit down,
okay?

51:30.811 --> 51:33.020
I'm sorry.
I need you to leave, please.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.712
-Have you eaten?
-Sam.

51:34.781 --> 51:36.472
Sam.
I need you to go.

51:36.541 --> 51:37.577
Carly.

51:39.993 --> 51:41.028
What's going on?

51:42.513 --> 51:45.102
I just came from Martin's
house, okay,

51:47.690 --> 51:49.589
because I saw Angela today.

51:49.658 --> 51:51.970
-You saw your mother--
-And I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

51:52.039 --> 51:55.560
I need some space
to think, so...

51:55.629 --> 51:57.942
-All right.
-That's what I need.

51:58.011 --> 51:59.944
-All right.
-Thank you.

52:00.013 --> 52:01.877
Um, yeah.

52:02.774 --> 52:04.604
-Totally get it.
-Thank you.

52:08.194 --> 52:11.749
-I will leave on one condition.
-What?

52:11.818 --> 52:15.201
That you will call me
if you need anything.

52:15.270 --> 52:16.719
I will be here in five minutes.

52:16.788 --> 52:17.824
Okay.

52:19.481 --> 52:20.827
Are you sure you're okay?

52:24.106 --> 52:25.142
Okay.

54:42.037 --> 54:43.763
-

55:30.948 --> 55:32.087
Babe?

55:32.156 --> 55:34.848
-

55:36.643 --> 55:38.749
-What the hell are you doing?
-Hi, I'm sorry.

55:38.818 --> 55:40.854
I was just so worried
about you, okay?

55:40.923 --> 55:43.236
-I couldn't sleep.
- I told you.

55:43.305 --> 55:44.617
I told you I just needed
some space.

55:44.686 --> 55:46.929
I know, but I was just really
concerned.

55:46.998 --> 55:48.137
Why are you banging on the door?

55:48.206 --> 55:49.311
-What time is it?
-I don't know.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.968
It's like 3:00 a.m.
or something.

55:51.037 --> 55:52.487
You crazy ho.

55:54.281 --> 55:57.768
You're the one with the fucking
kitchen knife.

56:01.737 --> 56:03.463
So yeah, I'm not gonna
stay long, babe.

56:03.532 --> 56:06.708
I just wanted to come and check
on you.

56:06.777 --> 56:08.330
Thank you.

56:08.399 --> 56:09.952
-I appreciate it.
-Well...

56:11.368 --> 56:13.370
You are my BFF.

56:14.232 --> 56:15.441
-I know.
-

56:15.510 --> 56:16.511
Thanks.

56:18.823 --> 56:19.859
Also...

56:22.931 --> 56:25.416
I wanted to show you
a little trick that I can do.

56:28.143 --> 56:33.148
-What?
-Yeah, it's just...

56:33.217 --> 56:34.977
It's just a little trick
I can do

56:35.046 --> 56:36.393
and I wanted you to see it.

56:39.085 --> 56:40.155
Okay, wait.

56:40.224 --> 56:41.259
Just wait, Carly.

56:45.712 --> 56:47.162
Don't be scared.

56:47.231 --> 56:49.406
Remember if you can't find me,
Carly,

56:49.475 --> 56:51.408
you can look for me
in the woods.

56:54.134 --> 56:55.722
What are you saying, Sam?

56:55.791 --> 56:57.137
Oh, it's just, um...

56:58.276 --> 56:59.795
Look, Carly.

56:59.864 --> 57:01.314
Just look.

57:01.383 --> 57:02.419
Look, Carly.

57:03.489 --> 57:06.768
-

57:06.837 --> 57:10.737
-

57:21.921 --> 57:23.923
-

57:26.235 --> 57:27.582
-

57:33.035 --> 57:38.040
-

57:58.785 --> 58:01.478
-

58:07.725 --> 58:10.487
-

58:16.458 --> 58:19.461
-

58:34.925 --> 58:38.998
It was just a dream.
It was just a dream.
It was just a dream.

58:39.550 --> 58:40.965
Okay, okay.

58:41.034 --> 58:42.760
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

58:43.658 --> 58:44.831
Fuck.

58:47.593 --> 58:52.183
-

58:52.252 --> 58:53.702
Come on, pick up.

58:55.601 --> 58:59.259
-Come on, pick up.
- Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message, I guess.

58:59.328 --> 59:00.502
Fuck.

59:00.571 --> 59:03.919
-

59:09.822 --> 59:13.342
Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message, I guess.

59:25.113 --> 59:26.252
-Look at her.
-

59:28.426 --> 59:31.360
That is absolute terror.

59:31.429 --> 59:32.914
It's become obsessed with her.

59:32.983 --> 59:35.433
Completely obsessed.

59:35.502 --> 59:38.264
Trapped in her mother's head
in a coma.

59:38.333 --> 59:41.405
Nothing but memories
of this girl in every direction.

59:41.992 --> 59:44.926
-It wants her.
- I don't like it.

59:44.995 --> 59:46.548
-We should contact her.
-

59:46.617 --> 59:48.585
Offer protection, bring her in.

59:49.896 --> 59:53.313
No, no, no, no.
It has chosen who it wants.

59:53.382 --> 59:55.005
Like they always fucking do.

59:56.696 --> 1:00:00.251
Gold team, take the patient
down to the vehicle.
Get her intubated.

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:02.702
We're gonna be heading out
to the sanitarium ASAP.

1:00:02.771 --> 1:00:04.255
We'll see you on level two.

1:00:04.324 --> 1:00:06.499
Roger that, sir.

1:00:11.193 --> 1:00:16.198
-

1:00:30.454 --> 1:00:34.734
-Come on, Sam.

1:00:34.803 --> 1:00:38.220
-

1:00:38.289 --> 1:00:41.189
Hey, this is Sam.
Leave a message, I guess.

1:00:41.258 --> 1:00:42.224
Fuck.

1:01:37.763 --> 1:01:38.764
Sam.

1:01:48.946 --> 1:01:49.947
Sam.

1:01:53.399 --> 1:01:54.883
Sam, are you here?

1:01:55.919 --> 1:01:56.920
It's Carly.

1:02:03.547 --> 1:02:04.582
Fuck.

1:02:06.377 --> 1:02:07.965
Fucking kidding me.

1:02:09.795 --> 1:02:10.830
Sam.

1:02:16.629 --> 1:02:18.665
This is 9-1-1.
State your type of emergency.

1:02:18.735 --> 1:02:22.152
I think something may have
happened to my friend.

1:02:23.394 --> 1:02:25.880
Her front door was open
and the power's out

1:02:25.949 --> 1:02:29.159
and she isn't answering
her phone.

1:02:29.228 --> 1:02:30.677
Okay, don't enter the house.

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:32.714
Please provide me
your location.

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.485
There's no signs
of forced entry.

1:02:45.554 --> 1:02:46.659
Okay, yeah.

1:02:46.728 --> 1:02:47.764
I didn't know.

1:02:50.801 --> 1:02:51.802
The power's out.

1:02:55.979 --> 1:02:58.947
She have a husband, boyfriend,
anyone staying here with her?

1:02:59.016 --> 1:03:02.261
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.
She was just here alone.

1:03:03.987 --> 1:03:05.712
Just gonna check upstairs first.

1:03:05.782 --> 1:03:06.783
Okay.

1:03:11.270 --> 1:03:12.305
Sam!

1:03:14.169 --> 1:03:15.170
Fuck.

1:03:17.552 --> 1:03:19.692
Come on, Sam, where are you?

1:03:21.038 --> 1:03:22.384
How old is she?

1:03:23.938 --> 1:03:25.249
Ma'am?

1:03:25.318 --> 1:03:27.838
-How old is she?
-Sorry. Uh, 38.

1:03:31.117 --> 1:03:33.568
Okay. Well, there's no signs
of forced entry.

1:03:33.637 --> 1:03:35.915
There's no obvious suspect.

1:03:35.984 --> 1:03:37.848
What?
What are you talking about?

1:03:37.917 --> 1:03:40.886
We'll give it 48 hours
and if it's necessary,

1:03:40.955 --> 1:03:42.128
we'll open up
a missing persons--

1:03:42.197 --> 1:03:44.061
48 hour--
Yes, yes, it's necessary.

1:03:44.130 --> 1:03:45.338
Can't we just do that now?

1:03:45.407 --> 1:03:48.238
Something has happened to her.
Please?

1:03:48.307 --> 1:03:50.585
Look, I understand how you
feel, ma'am.

1:03:50.654 --> 1:03:54.416
I also know that almost all
these calls resolve in 48 hours.

1:03:54.485 --> 1:03:56.487
Hey, I suggest get a good sleep.

1:03:56.556 --> 1:03:58.489
She'll probably show up
in the morning.

1:03:59.007 --> 1:04:01.699
-

1:04:04.219 --> 1:04:06.877
- Okay.

1:04:08.361 --> 1:04:11.019
Hey, hey.

1:04:11.088 --> 1:04:13.435
I'm really sorry that I left
like that before.

1:04:13.504 --> 1:04:15.092
I know it's like 3:30
in the morning, too.

1:04:15.161 --> 1:04:16.922
That's-- That's okay.
You wanna come in?

1:04:16.991 --> 1:04:18.233
Yeah.

1:04:20.339 --> 1:04:23.100
I'm sorry. I just I didn't know
where else to go.

1:04:23.169 --> 1:04:24.619
Don't worry about it,
it's all right.

1:04:24.688 --> 1:04:25.620
So what happened?
What's going on?

1:04:25.689 --> 1:04:27.173
It's Sam.
She's missing.

1:04:27.242 --> 1:04:29.796
-The police won't open a case.
-Hold on a second.

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:31.453
-What do you mean the police?
-I don't know.
She's missing, okay?

1:04:31.522 --> 1:04:33.145
-I don't know.
-Okay.

1:04:33.214 --> 1:04:34.594
Okay, hey, just slow down.

1:04:34.663 --> 1:04:36.217
Come on, come sit down.

1:04:38.081 --> 1:04:39.876
Am I crazy?

1:04:39.945 --> 1:04:43.569
-

1:04:45.019 --> 1:04:47.711
I had a nightmare.
I swear it was real.

1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:50.231
It feels like it happened.

1:04:52.198 --> 1:04:53.959
Sam was in it.

1:04:54.028 --> 1:04:57.376
She told me to look for her
in the woods

1:04:57.445 --> 1:04:58.756
if I couldn't find her.

1:05:00.137 --> 1:05:01.898
In the dream, she said that.

1:05:03.900 --> 1:05:08.145
When I woke up, I called her
and there was no answer

1:05:08.214 --> 1:05:10.216
and I know that she should be
home.

1:05:11.148 --> 1:05:14.669
So I went there
to where she's staying

1:05:14.738 --> 1:05:15.981
and she wasn't there.

1:05:16.050 --> 1:05:17.706
The house was open.

1:05:17.775 --> 1:05:20.330
The doors were wide open.

1:05:31.099 --> 1:05:33.722
That's what used to
happen to me.

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:35.310
The dreams, the woods.

1:05:36.794 --> 1:05:39.487
I mean, Sam must be trying to
tell you where she is.

1:05:39.556 --> 1:05:41.213
With that thing.

1:05:41.282 --> 1:05:42.869
Always back to that fucking
building.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:44.181
That goddamn building.

1:05:45.079 --> 1:05:47.771
Wait.
You think it's actually true?

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:49.704
Something she told me
in a dream?

1:05:49.773 --> 1:05:51.740
She's actually there?

1:05:51.809 --> 1:05:53.501
I mean, we have to go there.

1:05:53.570 --> 1:05:54.571
No fucking way.

1:05:54.640 --> 1:05:55.813
Well, then I have to go.

1:05:55.882 --> 1:05:57.919
-I have to get her.
-And do what?

1:05:57.988 --> 1:06:00.059
I don't know.
I just, I know I have to try.

1:06:00.128 --> 1:06:02.613
-Why is this even a discussion?
-Carly, you can't just
go up there.

1:06:02.682 --> 1:06:04.477
Think about it for a second.
Just wait, wait, wait, wait,
think.

1:06:04.546 --> 1:06:05.547
-Just think it through.
-Get out of my way.

1:06:05.616 --> 1:06:08.205
It lures you, right?

1:06:08.274 --> 1:06:10.207
Years later.
Decades later.

1:06:10.276 --> 1:06:11.484
It uses everything you care
about.

1:06:11.553 --> 1:06:12.899
Your friends, your family.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.487
It fucks with them.
It sends them visions.

1:06:14.556 --> 1:06:16.144
It's fucking with you.
Don't you get that?

1:06:16.213 --> 1:06:17.870
It wants you to go up there.

1:06:23.634 --> 1:06:26.396
You wanna end up
like your mother?
Do you wanna burn people?

1:06:26.465 --> 1:06:28.432
Sam stood by me
when no one else did.

1:06:28.501 --> 1:06:32.333
I have to go. I have to.
I don't have a choice.

1:06:34.473 --> 1:06:37.407
God damn it, you're forcing me
to go up there with you.

1:07:21.623 --> 1:07:23.798
-Yeah.
-All right.

1:07:49.410 --> 1:07:50.721
That's her car.

1:07:50.790 --> 1:07:52.758
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:08:00.973 --> 1:08:02.837
No, no, no.
You stay here.

1:08:09.119 --> 1:08:10.914
She there?
-No.

1:08:13.813 --> 1:08:16.954
-

1:08:36.767 --> 1:08:37.941
You see that?

1:08:38.010 --> 1:08:40.288
-What is that?
-

1:08:52.645 --> 1:08:53.819
Sam.

1:09:07.488 --> 1:09:08.903
Sam.

1:09:13.356 --> 1:09:14.391
Sam.

1:09:19.638 --> 1:09:21.087
Carly, Carly.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:22.399
What?

1:09:24.988 --> 1:09:26.023
You see?

1:09:28.509 --> 1:09:30.649
-What?
-There.

1:09:37.069 --> 1:09:38.104
Hey.

1:09:39.865 --> 1:09:40.900
Hey, Sam.

1:09:42.902 --> 1:09:45.319
Hey. It's me.

1:09:45.388 --> 1:09:46.389
It's Carly.

1:09:48.391 --> 1:09:50.807
-It's Carly, Sam. Okay?
-

1:09:50.876 --> 1:09:52.740
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's me.

1:09:52.809 --> 1:09:53.775
It's Carly.

1:09:53.844 --> 1:09:54.880
Okay?

1:09:56.088 --> 1:09:57.365
Let's get out of here, okay?

1:09:57.434 --> 1:09:58.780
I saw things.

1:09:58.849 --> 1:10:00.161
I saw myself.

1:10:00.230 --> 1:10:01.680
Okay.

1:10:01.749 --> 1:10:03.129
I was burning alive.

1:10:05.511 --> 1:10:06.478
Let's go, okay?

1:10:06.547 --> 1:10:09.205
Sam, come on, let's go.

1:10:09.274 --> 1:10:10.447
Come on, Sam.

1:10:10.516 --> 1:10:12.035
How did I get here?

1:10:12.104 --> 1:10:14.175
-Did I drive here?
-Yes, yes.

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:16.142
Okay, all right, we gotta go.
Let's go, come on.

1:10:16.212 --> 1:10:18.041
All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1:10:20.595 --> 1:10:22.183
-It's okay.
-

1:10:22.252 --> 1:10:23.426
They took her.

1:10:24.910 --> 1:10:25.980
They took Angela.

1:10:26.946 --> 1:10:28.569
She's in there.

1:10:28.638 --> 1:10:30.812
-Wait.
-The men, they took her.

1:10:30.881 --> 1:10:32.193
They took her into the building.

1:10:32.262 --> 1:10:34.368
She's there.
She's just in there.

1:10:34.437 --> 1:10:37.405
What?
-Just keep her walking.
Please, come on.

1:10:37.474 --> 1:10:38.682
Sam, what do you mean?

1:10:38.751 --> 1:10:39.718
Tell me what you mean.

1:10:39.787 --> 1:10:41.478
Sam, are you sure it was Angela?

1:10:43.791 --> 1:10:45.620
I just need to sleep,
please.

1:10:48.347 --> 1:10:51.592
Come on.
- Let's get you
in there. Get you in there.

1:10:51.661 --> 1:10:54.319
-

1:11:04.984 --> 1:11:07.677
- Okay, let's get out
of here.

1:11:08.816 --> 1:11:10.749
No, no, wait.

1:11:10.818 --> 1:11:12.716
-Wait.
- What do you mean
wait?

1:11:12.785 --> 1:11:14.373
We have her, we have Sam.
We gotta go, we gotta go.

1:11:14.442 --> 1:11:16.755
-Let's go, we're going.
-No, no.

1:11:16.824 --> 1:11:18.826
Angela is up there.

1:11:18.895 --> 1:11:20.172
You heard what she said.

1:11:21.138 --> 1:11:22.174
Listen to me.

1:11:22.830 --> 1:11:24.797
It's luring you
and now it's using

1:11:24.866 --> 1:11:26.592
the visions it's given Sam
to get you

1:11:26.661 --> 1:11:27.697
to go back into that building.

1:11:27.766 --> 1:11:29.802
Carly, please don't do this.

1:11:29.871 --> 1:11:34.635
If this is all true,
then I abandoned her.

1:11:35.636 --> 1:11:36.878
You know she's innocent.

1:11:37.983 --> 1:11:39.295
I can't leave her here.

1:11:40.434 --> 1:11:42.332
It's all right, you can go,
okay?

1:11:43.437 --> 1:11:45.887
-It's all right.
-

1:11:47.337 --> 1:11:51.272
If you're going,
I'm going with ya.

1:12:21.820 --> 1:12:24.340
-Oh, my God.
-Okay.

1:12:24.409 --> 1:12:26.203
What the fuck
happened here?
-

1:12:26.687 --> 1:12:29.828
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling the police.

1:12:29.897 --> 1:12:31.312
I mean, that guy needs help,
right?

1:12:31.381 --> 1:12:32.900
Unless he's dead.

1:12:34.522 --> 1:12:35.489
Fucking no reception.

1:12:35.558 --> 1:12:36.559
Jesus.

1:12:45.084 --> 1:12:51.263
Okay, listen. We're gonna
leave Sam right here
and we're gonna go in.

1:12:51.332 --> 1:12:52.816
We're gonna find Angela.

1:12:52.885 --> 1:12:54.508
And if we don't find her
after 10 minutes,

1:12:54.577 --> 1:12:56.164
we're leaving, okay?

1:12:56.233 --> 1:13:00.306
-

1:13:24.089 --> 1:13:25.297
Hey, another guy.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:41.417
What the fuck
is going on?

1:13:44.143 --> 1:13:45.179
Wait.

1:13:46.249 --> 1:13:47.492
That's the simulation.

1:13:49.494 --> 1:13:50.978
That's what I saw in the clinic.

1:13:55.638 --> 1:13:57.260
They're exorcists.

1:13:57.329 --> 1:14:00.470
- Oh, God.

1:14:03.128 --> 1:14:04.267
Hey, Carly.

1:14:06.096 --> 1:14:07.822
-I think he's still alive.
-

1:14:08.064 --> 1:14:09.341
I recognize him.

1:14:12.448 --> 1:14:14.173
Daniel. Daniel.

1:14:14.242 --> 1:14:15.451
Hey, it's Carly.

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:18.039
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

1:14:20.939 --> 1:14:22.285
First aid kit.
I can do medical attention.

1:14:22.354 --> 1:14:23.838
No, it's all over.

1:14:24.874 --> 1:14:27.566
-Don't.
-Daniel, where is she?

1:14:27.635 --> 1:14:29.465
Where's Angela?
Is she here?

1:14:31.501 --> 1:14:33.952
We always bring the possessed

1:14:34.021 --> 1:14:35.850
back to the place of infection.

1:14:36.713 --> 1:14:41.615
The simulation let us go into
the mind of the possessed

1:14:41.684 --> 1:14:43.617
to draw the thing out.

1:14:45.273 --> 1:14:47.310
We took all precautions,

1:14:49.070 --> 1:14:52.246
but it jumped from her
into Michael.

1:15:04.948 --> 1:15:10.851
Now that it's free,
it won't stop coming for you,
Carly.

1:15:15.821 --> 1:15:17.651
The holy lance.

1:15:17.720 --> 1:15:20.999
It's been in the Vatican
for 1,000 years.

1:15:22.138 --> 1:15:23.829
Take it, Carly.

1:15:23.898 --> 1:15:25.831
It's the only thing
that will kill it.

1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:30.698
How do I help my mom?
What do I do?

1:15:30.767 --> 1:15:35.116
Load into
the simulation and try to
help get her out,

1:15:35.185 --> 1:15:37.256
but I think she's too far gone.

1:15:38.499 --> 1:15:40.259
The simulation is active now.

1:15:40.328 --> 1:15:42.538
Follow the cables.

1:15:42.607 --> 1:15:44.712
-Go.
-Everything's spent.

1:15:44.781 --> 1:15:46.300
There's no ammo.

1:15:46.369 --> 1:15:49.061
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1:16:24.441 --> 1:16:26.236
Listen to me.

1:16:26.305 --> 1:16:29.515
If it takes me, shoot me.

1:16:32.829 --> 1:16:34.348
You understand?

1:16:34.417 --> 1:16:37.523
I can't go through
what she went through.

1:16:37.593 --> 1:16:38.732
Okay?

1:16:38.801 --> 1:16:41.493
-Okay.

1:16:52.746 --> 1:16:56.025
What stinks?
-Yeah.

1:16:58.027 --> 1:16:59.338
Okay.

1:17:19.496 --> 1:17:22.016
You see that?
- Yeah, what is that?

1:17:37.860 --> 1:17:40.621
Fuck.
Where is this motherfucker?

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:41.967
Jesus.

1:17:56.016 --> 1:17:57.465
Okay, here we go.

1:17:57.534 --> 1:18:02.539
-

1:18:08.166 --> 1:18:09.926
This is insane.

1:18:09.995 --> 1:18:15.000
-

1:18:27.047 --> 1:18:28.186
Mom.

1:18:34.744 --> 1:18:36.194
What do you do?

1:18:36.263 --> 1:18:39.128
I go in
and I try to get her out.

1:18:39.197 --> 1:18:41.406
Can you pass me that?
The head thing.

1:18:41.475 --> 1:18:43.235
-Yeah.
-The thing right there.

1:18:47.688 --> 1:18:48.724
Thank you.

1:18:50.933 --> 1:18:53.901
-Okay, I'm gonna keep guard.

1:18:53.970 --> 1:18:56.041
But you do this fast, okay?

1:18:56.110 --> 1:18:58.009
Yes. Yeah.

1:18:58.078 --> 1:18:59.113
Hey.

1:19:00.149 --> 1:19:01.909
Thank you, Martin.

1:19:19.927 --> 1:19:20.928
Mom.

1:19:24.725 --> 1:19:25.761
Mom, it's me.

1:19:29.799 --> 1:19:31.421
Mom, please where are you?

1:20:21.506 --> 1:20:25.130
-

1:20:25.199 --> 1:20:28.202
-

1:20:29.652 --> 1:20:31.516
-Who's there?
-

1:20:32.655 --> 1:20:35.347
-Hey.
-

1:20:53.676 --> 1:20:55.781
All right, motherfucker,
stop right there.

1:20:57.231 --> 1:20:58.750
I'm not gonna ask again.

1:20:58.819 --> 1:21:00.200
Stop.

1:21:00.269 --> 1:21:05.274
-

1:21:09.554 --> 1:21:11.867
Fuck. Come on!

1:21:14.524 --> 1:21:15.594
Let's go.

1:21:44.451 --> 1:21:46.073
Mom.

1:22:06.611 --> 1:22:08.820
Mom, hey, it's me.
It's Carly.

1:22:13.790 --> 1:22:14.826
Carly.

1:22:17.415 --> 1:22:18.450
Carly.

1:22:19.900 --> 1:22:22.523
No, my baby, you can't be here.

1:22:22.592 --> 1:22:24.594
You must go.
You must be safe.

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:30.635
I know it left me in here,
but now it's gone.

1:22:30.704 --> 1:22:33.120
They're out there where you are.

1:22:33.189 --> 1:22:34.880
Mom, come.

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:37.055
Come on, you can't stay here,
okay?

1:22:37.124 --> 1:22:38.470
You can join me outside.

1:22:40.334 --> 1:22:43.130
Do you know what this place is?

1:22:43.199 --> 1:22:44.890
No, I've never been here.

1:22:46.962 --> 1:22:50.793
It was a house I always
imagined for us.

1:22:52.312 --> 1:22:54.555
A more idyllic place
for you to grow up.

1:22:55.556 --> 1:22:58.974
Now it's just a bunch
of rotting memories.

1:23:01.838 --> 1:23:03.357
Decaying dreams.

1:23:04.669 --> 1:23:08.052
-A future that never happened.
-

1:23:08.121 --> 1:23:09.191
I failed you.

1:23:09.950 --> 1:23:12.642
No, you didn't.
You didn't. I...

1:23:12.711 --> 1:23:13.989
I understand now.

1:23:15.231 --> 1:23:17.544
Okay? Mom.

1:23:17.613 --> 1:23:19.097
Mom.

1:23:19.166 --> 1:23:21.858
I need you to come with me.
Okay?

1:23:21.927 --> 1:23:24.413
I need to get you out of here,
please.

1:23:25.586 --> 1:23:27.864
I'm not strong enough
to go out there.

1:23:28.969 --> 1:23:30.005
Not anymore.

1:23:32.352 --> 1:23:35.010
Mom, I can help you
out there in the world.

1:23:36.666 --> 1:23:38.116
I can help you.

1:23:38.185 --> 1:23:40.429
I can look after you, please.

1:23:40.498 --> 1:23:41.533
No.

1:23:42.534 --> 1:23:48.575
I'm at peace now.
All I ask is that there's
no more pain.

1:23:48.644 --> 1:23:49.852
You go out.

1:23:50.922 --> 1:23:51.957
You live.

1:23:52.751 --> 1:23:56.514
-Live a life of love
and happiness.
-

1:23:56.583 --> 1:24:00.276
And you leave all this behind.

1:24:01.691 --> 1:24:04.970
-I'm sorry
for the years we lost.
-No.

1:24:06.558 --> 1:24:08.940
But I got to see you
one more time.

1:24:09.009 --> 1:24:11.529
No, Mom. Mom, don't.

1:24:11.598 --> 1:24:13.048
No.

1:24:13.117 --> 1:24:18.087
-

1:24:23.368 --> 1:24:25.612
No.

1:24:26.406 --> 1:24:29.409
No, please don't do this.
Please don't do this, Mom, no.

1:24:29.478 --> 1:24:31.894
Mom, no, please.

1:24:41.145 --> 1:24:44.009
-

1:24:54.330 --> 1:24:55.573
Martin.

1:24:57.299 --> 1:24:58.403
Martin.

1:25:08.793 --> 1:25:10.277
I'm sorry.

1:25:26.121 --> 1:25:27.122
Martin.

1:25:40.169 --> 1:25:41.481
Martin.

1:25:51.663 --> 1:25:54.977
-

1:26:11.787 --> 1:26:13.685
Daniel. Daniel.

1:26:14.376 --> 1:26:15.584
Fuck.

1:27:11.122 --> 1:27:12.399
Oh, God.

1:27:12.468 --> 1:27:15.782
No. No. No.

1:27:16.645 --> 1:27:19.303
-

1:27:20.407 --> 1:27:23.168
-

1:27:29.071 --> 1:27:32.074
This can't be happening.
This can't be real.

1:27:35.388 --> 1:27:37.804
-

1:27:57.824 --> 1:27:58.963
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1:28:04.969 --> 1:28:08.524
-

1:28:22.849 --> 1:28:24.713
-

1:28:59.334 --> 1:29:00.335
Oh, my God.

1:29:06.410 --> 1:29:08.481
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:29:09.482 --> 1:29:10.793
-Oh, my God. God.
-Carly.

1:29:10.862 --> 1:29:12.933
It's... it's here for you.

1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:16.005
It's waiting.
It's a trap.
You have to go.

1:29:16.074 --> 1:29:18.456
No, no, no.
I'm not leaving you, okay?

1:29:18.525 --> 1:29:20.285
I'm not leaving you.

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:23.116
-

1:29:34.714 --> 1:29:36.543
Go. Go!

1:29:36.612 --> 1:29:37.924
Go!

1:30:19.586 --> 1:30:21.864
Martin, Martin.

1:30:21.933 --> 1:30:25.247
Did you know that I like to
burn things?

1:30:25.316 --> 1:30:27.283
I burn all their weapons.

1:30:27.352 --> 1:30:29.665
All their crucifixes
and their bibles.

1:30:29.734 --> 1:30:30.701
All their guns.

1:30:30.770 --> 1:30:33.773
But really, Marty...

1:30:35.222 --> 1:30:37.086
I like to burn people.

1:30:38.674 --> 1:30:44.646
And I think when I come back
in her body...

1:30:45.163 --> 1:30:47.649
Mm.

1:30:49.064 --> 1:30:50.893
I will burn you.

1:30:50.962 --> 1:30:53.620
-

1:30:55.035 --> 1:30:57.037
You leave her alone.

1:30:57.935 --> 1:30:58.936
No!

1:30:59.005 --> 1:31:00.696
No, you leave her!

1:31:00.765 --> 1:31:02.077
Leave her!

1:31:40.011 --> 1:31:42.393
Fuck! No, no.

1:33:01.058 --> 1:33:04.026
-

1:33:04.786 --> 1:33:06.719
-Oh.

1:33:06.788 --> 1:33:09.549
-

1:33:09.618 --> 1:33:12.310
You are my new home.

1:33:16.280 --> 1:33:17.419
Fuck you!

1:33:17.488 --> 1:33:20.180
-

1:33:30.605 --> 1:33:31.882
What the fuck is this?

1:33:31.951 --> 1:33:34.367
Where the fuck did you get it?

1:33:39.993 --> 1:33:43.272
-

1:33:55.526 --> 1:33:58.011
-

1:34:25.556 --> 1:34:28.317
Submit to me.
-

1:34:28.386 --> 1:34:30.112
Die!

1:34:30.181 --> 1:34:33.253
-

1:34:40.502 --> 1:34:42.331
Obey me.

1:35:15.744 --> 1:35:19.472
-

1:35:38.594 --> 1:35:42.081
-

1:35:43.151 --> 1:35:45.601
What have you done?
-

1:35:46.430 --> 1:35:47.569
Die!

1:36:26.642 --> 1:36:29.093
-

1:36:55.016 --> 1:36:57.673
-

1:38:11.195 --> 1:38:13.025
Hey.

1:38:13.094 --> 1:38:14.578
I got you these.

1:38:20.687 --> 1:38:22.586
Thanks. Uh...

1:38:23.552 --> 1:38:24.760
They're lovely.

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:26.797
How you feeling?

1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:29.973
The doctor said you're healing
really well.

1:38:31.146 --> 1:38:32.320
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:38:33.183 --> 1:38:36.289
They say you'll get to go home
by the end of the week.

1:38:36.358 --> 1:38:37.635
Yeah.

1:38:38.636 --> 1:38:40.569
Well, did you want a ride?

1:38:40.638 --> 1:38:42.571
I'll drive you home.
I'll come check on you.

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:44.919
I'll bring you
chicken noodle soup.

1:38:44.988 --> 1:38:47.749
-Cups of pudding.
Is that what you like, pudding?
-

1:38:47.818 --> 1:38:49.820
Don't make me laugh.
