00:50.500 --> 00:52.500
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:52.500 --> 00:58.000
please welcome on stage
Mr Nice himself, Howard Marks.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.600
Thank you.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.400
Thank you, thank you.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.200
Any, erm...

01:16.200 --> 01:19.100
Any plain-clothes policemen in tonight?

01:20.900 --> 01:23.900
No, seriously, are there any
plain-clothes policemen in tonight?

01:23.900 --> 01:25.900
No!

01:25.900 --> 01:28.000
Are you sure?

01:30.200 --> 01:33.400
Are there any dope smokers in tonight?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.300
I came from Kenfig Hill
in the Welsh valleys.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.400
There were more pubs than chapels,

01:49.500 --> 01:51.800
more coal mines than schools.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.800
16 per cent.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.300
Marks, very good.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.800
98 per cent.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.900
Swot!

02:07.400 --> 02:09.699
Sissy boy!

02:16.300 --> 02:19.500
Are you all right, love?

02:32.700 --> 02:35.100
Howard, bach, you're not well at all, man.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.900
It was 104 five minutes ago.
I took it myself.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.300
Well, it could be undulant fever.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.100
No more rugby for you this term, boyo.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.600
I'll make sure there's a prescription
down the chemist for him.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.800
- Do you know what a scalar field is?
- No.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.300
- No?
- No.

03:05.300 --> 03:09.400
Do you know what a... vector is?

03:09.300 --> 03:11.800
No idea.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.200
- They sound like monsters, don't they?
- Yeah.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.100
I learned a few things
and I got grade As in all my subjects.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.500
To my overwhelming surprise,

03:20.500 --> 03:24.300
the headmaster took me aside one day
and said he wanted me to sit

03:24.300 --> 03:27.800
the Oxford University
entrance scholarship examination.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.600
Oxford is the most traumatic
experience England has to offer its young.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.700
I was there between 1945 and '48

03:35.600 --> 03:38.900
and I've had to live ever since
with the conviction

03:39.000 --> 03:43.800
that nothing in my after life
has in any way topped

03:43.700 --> 03:46.700
the exhilaration,
the privilege that I felt then.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.100
To my even greater surprise,
I was called up for an interview.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.800
Where are you from, then?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.800
- Garw.
- What?

04:07.800 --> 04:10.500
Garw.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.400
I'm sorry? I can't understand you.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.899
- Garw, I said. It's in Wales.
- Mr Locke.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.000
Where are you from?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.200
Eton.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.700
You open it.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.300
Howard,

04:52.200 --> 04:54.300
I don't know what to say.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.800
- You've done it, son! You've done it!
- No, no, no!

04:59.800 --> 05:02.600
- Yes! Well done.
- I knew it, Dad. I knew I'd do it.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.000
Mum! Mum! Where's Mum?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Come on, we're late.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.100
Ten minutes. We've got ten minutes.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.700
Come on, Mum.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.600
My success went completely to my head

05:15.700 --> 05:19.500
and I've been living off it,
to some extent, ever since.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.000
- Who's got the ticket?
- Don't be stupid.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.900
I... You've got the ticket.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.400
He's got the ticket.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.000
- Oh, hello.
- All right?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.900
I'm your scout, George.

06:14.800 --> 06:19.300
I... I make the beds and do the dishes
and clean up the room.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.100
- Oh, you don't have to do that, man...
- Oh, I do, Mr...?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.200
Marks. Howard. Call me Howard.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.500
No ladies in here after dinner.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
Oh, no. No, no.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.400
Right, OK.

06:33.400 --> 06:38.200
I've never had anyone
do anything for me before, you know.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.900
I've never...
had a porter carry my bags.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.800
Never had waiter service in a restaurant.
Never stayed in a hotel.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.300
Smart lad like you, Howard,

06:49.200 --> 06:51.800
time you got used to it!

06:51.800 --> 06:53.900
- Yeah.
- Bye.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.500
Come on. Come on.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.400
- Come on.
- Hello?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.900
- Come on!
- Come on, what?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Open!

07:15.100 --> 07:16.000
Oh, sorry.

07:16.100 --> 07:18.500
What are you doing?
I don't wanna get caught.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.300
Oh, fuck.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.500
- Let me, erm... help you.
- Just... OK.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.500
- Careful.
- Yeah, that's it. OK.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.700
- Just ssh! OK?
- Right.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.400
- Put the bar back.
- Right.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.500
Er...

07:37.300 --> 07:39.300
Hello?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.600
Come on.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.300
- Who the fuck are you?
- He's the new doorkeeper.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.700
Are you in room 1-11?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.100
Come in.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
Close the door.

08:31.900 --> 08:33.299
Dig this.

08:34.500 --> 08:39.600
"The soft vibrations of desire,

08:39.500 --> 08:45.100
"given with meat hand and cock."

08:45.000 --> 08:52.700
"Desire taken with mouth and ass."

08:52.600 --> 08:56.100
"Desire returned to the last sigh!"

08:57.000 --> 09:01.500
"And the happy laugh of innocent babies."

09:14.700 --> 09:18.300
- Have a toke.
- A what?

09:18.400 --> 09:19.800
A drag.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.900
I don't take drugs. I mean, I...
I've never tried it.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.500
I'm not gonna get hooked now, am I?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.200
Keep it deep in your lungs.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.200
OK?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.900
Let it go.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.400
Good.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.700
Don't feel anything.

10:35.100 --> 10:38.900
Now, the thing is,
I didn't set out to be a dope dealer.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.200
It's not something I'm proud of.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.900
But a dealer is really just someone
who buys more dope than he can smoke,

10:46.800 --> 10:51.500
and I have to say I'm ashamed,
I tried to smoke it all.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.100
There was just too fucking much of it.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.600
- Hold it in. Hold it in.
- That's good.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.600
See, I've heard
that hash makes you sex mad.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.300
Well, that's one thing they're right about.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.300
Hey, Howard, you barbarian!

12:20.100 --> 12:22.300
- That's my girlfriend.
- Sorry, Mac.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
Give me a kiss.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.500
Smoking kif gets a bit pathetic.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.400
Not when you've got some opium.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.100
It's the great absolver.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.600
- Is that LSD?
- The power...

13:11.700 --> 13:15.400
The voltage of the city
running through your mind. Try it.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.400
Here we go.

13:17.500 --> 13:21.600
- Do you chew it or suck it?
- Suck it.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.900
All right. I'm sucking.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.900
- I can't feel a fucking thing.
- Give your head a rub, man.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.300
Get it clean into your brain.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.200
Oh, fucking hell!

13:54.100 --> 13:56.600
It's fucking mental!

14:02.400 --> 14:06.100
Help me! Somebody help me!

14:10.500 --> 14:13.100
Help me, somebody!

14:26.100 --> 14:28.200
Argh!

14:39.900 --> 14:42.000
Oh, fuck!

14:45.800 --> 14:49.000
All right!
I fucking can't even harm my foot!

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
My fucking foot!
Ow, my fucking foot!

14:52.000 --> 14:53.700
My fucking foot!

15:00.000 --> 15:06.300
The Dean got the charges dropped
as all they could find on me was a roach.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.900
But I was warned,
knuckle down and study.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.900
So I stopped smoking marijuana,
read as much as I could,

15:16.300 --> 15:21.600
and graduated from Oxford University
with a second-class degree.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.300
Although we revelled
in each other's company,

15:31.300 --> 15:36.300
I have no idea why Ilze and I
took the extraordinarily impractical step

15:36.200 --> 15:38.200
of getting married.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.300
We moved to London.

15:40.500 --> 15:46.800
We had no money, and our prospects
were as two poorly paid teachers.

15:46.600 --> 15:50.000
We must set a good example.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.000
Long hair and colourful clothes do not.

15:55.900 --> 15:59.000
I think a three-piece suit should be worn
under the gown...

15:59.000 --> 16:04.400
I had gone straight just when
the rest of the country had started to swing.

16:05.100 --> 16:08.700
- I've put acid in the punch, so...
- Oh fuck, I've got to be careful.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.800
You know?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.500
We're not smoking weed.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.800
- How long?
- Six months.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.400
- Six fucking months?
- I'm teaching now. I can't smoke.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.600
- Did you start freaking out, or...
- No. No, no.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.400
- You see the world the way it is.
- Don't blame it all on the world.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.600
I'm not. That's your idea,
to stop smoking. All right?

16:25.600 --> 16:29.600
- Isn't it great?
- At times like this, I could murder a joint.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.500
- You should have some.
- No, come on! Stop!

16:32.500 --> 16:35.100
- All right, OK!
- Oh, no, it's... Listen...

16:35.100 --> 16:38.400
- This is not fair.
- I feel good, I feel good.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.200
How do you afford a place like this,
Graham?

16:40.300 --> 16:43.600
I'm shifting 50 pounds of the finest
Pakistani black every fucking month.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.900
- Fucking hell.
- Fucking hell!

16:47.500 --> 16:49.800
- Lot of money.
- Lot of money.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.900
Well done. Is it... You know...
It's got to be risky, isn't it?

16:52.900 --> 16:54.500
If you get stopped, you're fucked.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.500
I've never been stopped.
I've done it hundreds of times.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.200
So you put it in the panels, do you?

16:59.200 --> 17:02.000
The side panels.
We take the fucking car apart

17:02.000 --> 17:03.900
and we stuff it everywhere we can get it.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Fucking hell, man.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.400
- But you know what, it pays for all this.
- I know, man! Jesus!

17:09.400 --> 17:12.599
- Yeah, man. Fucking hell.
- Beautiful.

17:13.599 --> 17:19.099
- Graham? Gonna have a look upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, whatever.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.300
All right?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900
- What's that?
- Go.

17:39.900 --> 17:44.200
- Sorry.
- No, stay.

17:44.300 --> 17:47.500
Go, an ancient Japanese game.
Wanna play?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.600
- Yeah.
- Here, roll me a joint.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.500
We take it in turns placing stones
on the board. Black goes first.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.600
Right. Erm... I put it anywhere, right?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.800
- As long as it's on an intersection.
- OK.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.600
There.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.100
Now, I play here.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.100
- Er... No, thanks.
- It's a great game to play stoned.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.300
- I had to give it up.
- Why?

18:17.300 --> 18:19.400
I'm a teacher.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.800
And what about sex?

18:25.400 --> 18:28.100
I'm married.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.200
You see, in the game of Go,

18:33.300 --> 18:35.900
when a stone has no free space next to it,

18:35.900 --> 18:38.500
it is captured and taken off the board.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.300
Bit like life, really.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.800
You don't look like a teacher.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.000
What do I look like, then?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.600
Like a drug smuggler.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.200
Hmm.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.100
- Hello.
- Llze, it's Mandy. Is Howard there, please?

19:26.000 --> 19:30.700
Uh... Mandy. Uhh...
He... He's sleeping.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.600
Graham's disappeared, OK?
I think he's been busted.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.300
Mandy? It's Howard.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.900
- Where is he?
- In Germany. Can you go there?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.400
I can't. I mean...

19:40.400 --> 19:42.800
You're the only straight person
Graham knows. Please.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.700
I've never been out of the country...
I haven't got a passport.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.900
Look, I... I'll call you back, all right?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
- I can't go.
- Howard...

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
What?

20:03.900 --> 20:06.600
I've fallen in love with someone else.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.500
Thank you.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.100
Bitte.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.800
I was just crossing the Swiss-German
border, like I'd done a hundred times before.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.500
You know,
they always just waved me through.

20:26.400 --> 20:29.700
This time, the German Nazis fucking
pulled me over and took the car apart.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.500
Found 100 pounds of Lebanese black
in the back seat and the panels.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.000
- Probablyjust wanted to smoke it.
- What else would they fucking do with it?

20:37.400 --> 20:40.200
And we've got a second batch
in a warehouse in Wiesbaden.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.800
It's in a Mercedes. Keys in the station.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.700
I've never driven
on the wrong side of the road.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.400
That's why you're perfect for it. You'll
sail through, they don't know your face.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.800
Look, I've done it too many fucking times.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.700
Now, you get it back to London
and you make a ton of money.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.400
How much?

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
Every time I crossed the border,

22:26.500 --> 22:31.200
I'd get a religious flash
and an asexual orgasm.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.200
Passeport.

23:02.300 --> 23:03.400
C'est bon, merci.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.200
Judy.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.300
Judy!

24:13.300 --> 24:15.200
Oh, shit!

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Sorry.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.200
Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.600
Come down.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.600
- It's the middle of the night.
- What?

24:23.700 --> 24:26.300
- It's the middle of the night.
- I know. Bring some fags.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.500
- I have a friend over.
- Come on, please, Judy.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.300
I got something amazing to show you.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.800
OK...

24:35.100 --> 24:38.200
Trouble is, I need somewhere to stash it.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.800
Right.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.400
Get the bags out.
Keep an eye out, yeah, for people?

24:44.300 --> 24:46.400
I got it.

24:46.900 --> 24:51.300
He's up there, is he? Don't suppose
he'd mind if I stayed the night, would he?

25:02.700 --> 25:04.500
Am I a criminal now?

25:05.800 --> 25:10.200
When you break a law that's wrong,
that can't be a crime.

25:10.200 --> 25:13.000
Not in the moral sense.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.700
Why is it against the law?

25:14.800 --> 25:19.600
Why make something illegal that expands
your consciousness, makes you think?

25:20.300 --> 25:22.500
Makes you wanna fuck.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.300
What the fuck...

25:40.700 --> 25:44.300
? You're lazy, you just stay in bed

25:45.500 --> 25:49.200
? You're lazy, just stay in bed

25:50.800 --> 25:54.400
? You don't want no money,
you don't want no bread

25:55.200 --> 26:00.100
? If you're drowning,
you don't clutch no straw, no, no

26:00.000 --> 26:01.400
? If you're drowning...

26:01.400 --> 26:03.300
- Yes?
- My name is Howard Marks.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.200
I'm a friend of Graham Plinston's.

26:05.200 --> 26:10.400
? You don't wanna live,
don't wanna cry no more, no more

26:16.400 --> 26:20.200
Hello, I'm Howard Marks.
You must be... Mr Durrani?

26:21.500 --> 26:24.600
Take a step forward.
Hands to the side.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.300
- Howard what?
- Marks. Howard Marks.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.400
Stay there. One second.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Chap here says, er, he's Howard Marks.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.100
Bring him in.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.100
- Come in.
- Thank you.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.400
My Name's Malik. This is Mr Durrani.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.900
- Mr Durrani. Hello.
- Good afternoon.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.200
- Mohammed Durrani.
- Nice to meet you.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.500
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.200
Would you like a drink?

26:56.300 --> 26:59.500
Yes, please. I'll have a... I'll have a whisky.
Thank you.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.900
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.000
You saw Plinston?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
I did. I... I...

27:09.100 --> 27:12.700
So, I got a call from him and
I drove out to see him in Germany. Erm...

27:12.700 --> 27:14.800
- Did he talk?
- No, he won't squeal.

27:15.500 --> 27:22.500
So he very kindly asked me to run
a little errand on your behalf. And, erm...

27:22.400 --> 27:24.600
I think you'll be pleased.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.600
Very impressive!

27:34.600 --> 27:37.600
Ah, well, I can see
you've been, er, very efficient.

27:37.500 --> 27:42.600
Well, I wish I had more to sell, you know.
I got rid of it all in a day, so... yeah.

27:42.600 --> 27:46.500
- How much do you charge per pound?
- 40 quid.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.300
Forty?

27:50.400 --> 27:54.100
- That's very good. Have you counted it?
- Yeah, it's all there, boys. It's all there.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.700
How much is it?

27:55.800 --> 27:59.300
In the papers
they call people who sell drugs pushers,

27:59.300 --> 28:02.300
like you've got to try really hard
to get rid of it.

28:02.300 --> 28:05.200
- Doesn't really work like that, does it?
- No, it doesn't.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.900
- Well...
- I tell you, Howard,

28:06.900 --> 28:11.800
I can get any amount of merchandise
up into the air from Karachi Airport.

28:11.700 --> 28:14.600
The problem
is how to get it onto the ground.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.700
Uh-huh.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.900
James McCann,
the people's hero from the Provisional lRA,

28:19.800 --> 28:23.300
in their struggle
against the British government.

28:23.300 --> 28:26.400
They've arrested him
and charged him with terrorism.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.300
He wouldn't recognise court,
turned his back on the proceedings.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.300
Crazy cat!

28:31.300 --> 28:33.100
They've thrown him in jail,

28:33.200 --> 28:35.300
he's escaped, sawed through the bars.

28:35.300 --> 28:39.000
The nutter's got every policeman in lreland
looking for him.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.900
Then out of the blue,
he comes into the office,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.200
gives us an interview for the magazine.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.400
Yeah, he's a...
He's a real revolutionary.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.100
- Welcome to paradise.
- Paradise?

28:53.100 --> 28:55.100
Jim?

28:57.500 --> 28:59.000
Jim?

28:59.500 --> 29:02.400
- Where's your man McCann?
- Hello?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.400
Likes his porn.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.600
Hey, your mam's in here.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.300
- Let's have a look.
- Doesn't she look like your mum?

29:12.400 --> 29:14.100
Shut up.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.000
Hashish should be illegal.
Gives us a means of living.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.800
A new currency to overthrow
the fascist overlords.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.500
I don't think it should be illegal.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.700
I can't condone
the punishing of people who smoke it.

29:26.800 --> 29:30.100
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello, Jim.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.300
Uh... Howard.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.700
- You're from Kabul, are you?
- I'm Welsh, actually.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.600
Welsh? Fucking Welsh!
What the fuck can you do?

29:46.500 --> 29:50.500
Well, I'm here to decide
whether you can help us or not.

29:50.500 --> 29:56.600
Help you? I'm the Kid. The Fox!
I decide if you're any fucking use to me.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.100
And you'd better be some fucking use!

29:58.200 --> 30:00.400
You were followed from the airport
by my boys.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.800
This place is surrounded by the lRA.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.500
Any fucking around
and you're gone, brother, gone!

30:05.500 --> 30:07.600
Right?

30:10.500 --> 30:12.200
Alan, why have you brought me this wimp?

30:12.200 --> 30:15.200
You was gonna get me someone
who could bring me arms from Kabul.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.800
I told you,
Kabul's not a place that sells arms.

30:17.800 --> 30:22.500
What the fuck do you mean, sell arms?
I don't buy fucking arms.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.700
I get given them by people
who want to ensure their future

30:24.700 --> 30:28.200
when we finally kick you fucking Brits
out of my country!

30:28.100 --> 30:30.200
Sell arms...

30:33.600 --> 30:35.000
Smoke, Jim?

30:37.300 --> 30:41.000
We're dope smugglers. We wanted to know
if you could help us bring it into the country.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.600
Pay you a lot of money for doing it.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.800
OK.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Did nobody tell you
what the boys do to drug dealers?

30:48.100 --> 30:51.100
We're revolutionaries,
not fucking drug pushers.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Out!

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
- Walk! Now! You, come on.
- OK.

30:56.100 --> 30:57.700
- Out!
- All right, Jim. All right.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.800
Come on!

31:04.600 --> 31:07.300
Down there. Come on!

31:10.300 --> 31:12.500
We've done nothing wrong.

31:16.700 --> 31:20.300
- Jim, please!
- Hey, hey! What the fuck are you doing?

31:20.200 --> 31:24.200
- Joint? Last request?
- You're not fucking listening, are ya?

31:24.300 --> 31:26.700
We don't want that filth here.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.600
Stand back.
I'm gonna kneecap Soppy Bollocks.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.600
No. No, no, man, listen. I'll go first.
He's shitting himself.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.000
- Do me.
- Good man.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.300
You might wanna sit down first,
so you don't crack your head when you fall.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.400
- Take your trousers down.
- What?

31:41.400 --> 31:42.700
It's for your own good.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.200
If I shoot you through the trousers, a bit of
cloth could get in the wound and infect it

31:46.200 --> 31:48.700
and you'd have to lose the leg.
Come on.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.600
All right.

31:55.600 --> 32:00.400
- That's very gracious of you.
- Will you be wanting that smoke now?

32:03.900 --> 32:06.200
Yeah.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.200
What's a Welsh prat like you doing
selling hash, anyway?

32:10.800 --> 32:13.700
You should've stuck to painting road signs.

32:16.500 --> 32:19.100
Give me that fucking joint.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.900
He's not getting a fucking penny.
That's my first condition.

32:31.900 --> 32:36.200
Condition number two. I want £500 cash
now for setting everything up

32:36.100 --> 32:39.500
and £5,000 for doing it. OK?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.900
All right.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.300
He was joking you.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.000
The Provos can't be involved
in any of this shite.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.400
If they find out, I'll be shot.

33:08.700 --> 33:12.700
You'll be shot,
we'll all be fucking shot.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.700
So, we don't sell the stuff in lreland.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.500
You'd better not be selling anything here.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.900
Could you get us some filthy films?

33:23.200 --> 33:29.600
Condoms? Priests have made them illegal.
They wanna charge us a kid a fuck.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.000
It's a fucking emergency.
I'm picking up my boss's luggage.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.400
That'll be grand. I'll keep my eye on it.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.900
See, Howard, I fucking own this place.

33:52.100 --> 33:53.900
Hey, watch yourself there.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.100
You see your man there?
That's Eamonn.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.800
- Right.
- He examines all the papers.

33:58.900 --> 34:02.500
Now, if he values his Guinness,
he'll pass the fucking lot.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
He thinks you're bringing in guns
for the cause,

34:04.400 --> 34:07.200
so make sure those cases
fucking rattle, OK?

34:07.200 --> 34:10.699
You see what I mean, Howard?
This place is wide open.

34:10.699 --> 34:13.100
How's about you, big man?
Keeping busy?

34:13.100 --> 34:15.100
- This is Howard.
- Nice to meet you.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.800
See you later, OK?
Right, this way.

34:16.800 --> 34:20.100
It's a brilliant plan, Jim.
When can we start?

34:20.100 --> 34:24.000
Fucking now. We've got it all together.
Bring in as much as you want.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.100
How soon can you send the nordle?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.600
What the fuck's nordle?

34:29.699 --> 34:34.900
Wise up. You have to use codes,
codes and false names. Nordle is hashish.

34:34.900 --> 34:36.600
- Nordle?
- OK?

34:37.300 --> 34:41.400
- Right.
- Listen, a word of advice, Howard.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.500
When you come back, don't fly here.
Fly somewhere else.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.800
Do the last bit by train or bus or car,
whatever.

34:46.800 --> 34:50.500
- Gus, this is Howard.
- Y'all right, Howard?

34:50.500 --> 34:53.300
- Hello, Gus.
- Howard.

34:55.900 --> 35:01.000
That was Gus. He's a member of
the Belfast Brigade's assassination squad.

35:00.900 --> 35:05.500
I wanted him to know your face, so no
fucking games now, you understand me?

35:08.900 --> 35:11.600
So you really think I can pass for a native?

35:12.700 --> 35:15.500
DH Marks, this is the perfect look for you.

35:15.500 --> 35:18.800
Remember, many Afridi
have blonde hair and blue eyes.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.000
Just look stoned and say nothing.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.200
What if they don't buy it?

35:24.200 --> 35:27.100
Then they'll probably rob you and kill you.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.600
Lbrahim!

36:16.900 --> 36:19.000
As-salaam alaikum.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.900
When you're making hash, this is your loot.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.400
It's in three different goatskins.
Black, white, brown.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.300
Three different qualities.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.000
- See these herbs?
- Uh-huh.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.300
When the flower comes up first,
you cut off the top,

36:37.300 --> 36:40.200
chop it up
and put that into the white goatskin.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.200
Then when the second flower
comes through,

36:42.300 --> 36:44.100
you chop that up,
put those in the brown bags.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.900
This is what you call medium quality,
but we use a lot. You see?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.600
- Oh, man!
- That's not the top quality.

36:49.700 --> 36:53.500
The top stuff we put in the white bag,
and we only use a little bit of it.

36:53.500 --> 36:58.000
Then this third flower that comes through,
you chop it up, put those into black bags.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.000
This is the one we use the most of.

37:00.100 --> 37:03.100
Be careful, because when we make hash
we have to mix up the three,

37:03.100 --> 37:05.000
because if you only use the top quality,

37:05.100 --> 37:07.200
you blow your head off.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.500
Should I say it's fantastic
or say it's not bad,

37:27.500 --> 37:30.500
say it's worth every penny
or say it's camel shit

37:30.500 --> 37:32.600
and they'd better come up
with something better?

37:32.600 --> 37:35.400
I need to roll a joint.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.800
It's what I'm used to, see?
It's the, er...

37:38.800 --> 37:42.100
It's the only way
I can make a fair assessment.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.000
- Mr Marks?
- That's right.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.700
- Patrick Lane, Judy's brother.
- Nice to meet you.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.800
I'm the square one of the family.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.900
Shall we?

38:16.900 --> 38:21.400
So, erm... I wanna open a business,
a shop, in Oxford.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.800
And, erm...
Well, I don't know quite how to go about it.

38:24.800 --> 38:28.200
Well, yes. I'm a chartered accountant.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.200
Um... How much do you have
to invest in the business?

38:31.100 --> 38:32.700
- A lot.
- Five thousand?

38:32.800 --> 38:36.100
- A lot. A lot.
- You don't really need more than five...

38:36.100 --> 38:40.100
I need someone to help me understand
how to put a lot of money in...

38:40.000 --> 38:42.100
- And how to take it out.
- Yeah.

38:42.900 --> 38:47.100
- You need to explain this big lot of money.
- Yeah.

38:47.900 --> 38:50.600
Sounds like you need a bent accountant.

38:52.900 --> 38:55.300
Everyone smile.

38:55.300 --> 38:57.300
I declare this shop open.

38:57.300 --> 39:00.900
Anna and Belinda
had no idea what I was up to.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.500
The shop became a successful
little dress emporium in its own right.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.600
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

39:07.700 --> 39:10.800
It was now that my story
took a bizarre twist.

39:11.300 --> 39:15.600
Quite out of the blue, my old friend Mac
walked into my shop.

39:15.500 --> 39:16.400
Mac, man!

39:16.500 --> 39:20.700
Cheers.
She's had to take a clerical job in a bank,

39:20.600 --> 39:23.500
which she finds monumentally tedious.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.600
You could do with a bit of money, then?

39:25.600 --> 39:28.100
Well, we're OK.

39:28.100 --> 39:32.300
It's just that I'll probably get
a foreign posting again, so it's...

39:32.300 --> 39:34.600
not really worth
putting down roots right now.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.900
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.200
Are you sure?
You know, erm....

39:40.000 --> 39:42.100
do a bit of work for me?

39:43.100 --> 39:46.200
- What?
- Well, you know, a bit of driving.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.600
- Two thousand pounds.
- Howard, don't be naughty.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.200
I work for the government.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.400
They don't really approve
of that sort of thing.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.400
Are you selling drugs, Howard?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.500
- Who? Me?
- Well, you seem to be doing very well.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.200
Look, it's the shop, man.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.800
It is. It's really taken off.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.600
I'm opening branches
in Dublin, Amsterdam.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.700
Still the same old Howard.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.400
How about the ladies?
Still having the old success?

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Look, I'm with Judy now.
She's pregnant.

40:21.500 --> 40:25.100
- But that wouldn't inhibit you, would it?
- What, chatting up other women?

40:25.100 --> 40:26.800
Not for narcissistic pleasure.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.600
What the fuck for, then, Mac?

40:33.100 --> 40:35.000
For Queen and country.

40:36.800 --> 40:40.600
Are you...
asking me to be a spy?

40:40.500 --> 40:45.200
Howard, I haven't just turned up on
your doorstep without doing my research.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.500
Will you help us?

40:47.500 --> 40:49.500
How can I help you?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.300
We need people to...

40:51.300 --> 40:53.300
gather information for us.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.700
Bloody hell, you are!

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
- You're a fucking spy!
- Howard, keep it down.

40:56.900 --> 40:59.200
This is not a James Bond movie.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.200
Well, it certainly feels like it.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.600
You're recruiting me.
You're asking me to be a member of Ml6.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.600
The Government doesn't ever
officially acknowledge the existence

41:08.600 --> 41:11.200
of what you call Ml6.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.100
However, we do need
to keep abreast of things,

41:14.100 --> 41:18.700
and we do employ a loose network
of people who do things for us.

41:19.500 --> 41:25.000
You travel in circles we can't penetrate,
which is why I need your help.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.500
Sort of a...

41:26.500 --> 41:29.000
patriotic thing, old chap.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.800
And I imagine this would give me...

41:37.900 --> 41:40.800
you know, a certain amount of... protection.

41:40.700 --> 41:45.300
We can't possibly condone any
criminal activity or grant immunity.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.900
However, if you're ever in trouble...

41:47.900 --> 41:49.600
call this number.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.600
I'm fat and ugly.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.300
I hate it here. I want to go to lbiza.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.500
I love it when you're brown.

42:05.500 --> 42:09.700
- So we'll go?
- Yeah, Judy, look, I've gotta go to lreland.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.300
Bullshit. Dealing's supposed to support us,
not become your life.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.900
Judy, I hate it, too. You know I hate it.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.000
Come to lbiza with me, Howie.

42:19.700 --> 42:21.800
Oh, shit.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.600
OK, love, I've gotta go. OK?

42:27.700 --> 42:29.800
- I love you.
- Come straight back.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.900
I promise.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.900
Love you.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.200
Aw, fuck.

42:59.900 --> 43:01.400
- You gonna be long?
- Fuck off.

43:01.400 --> 43:03.500
All right!

43:04.400 --> 43:07.300
Do you mind if I jump the queue?
It's an emergency.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.300
There's a queue!

43:10.600 --> 43:12.500
I changed my plans and everythin'!

43:12.500 --> 43:17.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

43:23.400 --> 43:27.300
- Operator.
- Can you connect me to Ballinskelligs 1?

43:27.300 --> 43:28.900
Lrish Republic.

43:28.900 --> 43:30.900
Please insert 50 pence.

43:32.700 --> 43:34.500
Come on.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.600
Come on.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.600
Hello. Ballinskelligs 1.
Who would you be wanting?

43:59.600 --> 44:05.200
Michael Murphy's, the shop, the farm,
or the strangers that arrived last night?

44:05.100 --> 44:09.200
Ahh... I... I.... I...
Th-Th-The strangers.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.900
Well, do you know,
I don't think they're at home,

44:11.900 --> 44:14.000
so I'll put you through to the pub.

44:25.100 --> 44:26.800
- Hello?
- Hello.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.600
- Is Jim McCann there?
- Who wants to know?

44:29.700 --> 44:33.200
Mr McCarthy. The nordle man.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.200
- What?
- Nordle!

44:35.300 --> 44:36.800
What the fuck is nordle?

44:37.300 --> 44:41.600
Jim, do you know anything
about some fucker called Nordle?

44:46.500 --> 44:47.600
Fucking eejit!

44:47.700 --> 44:50.100
Are you trying to blow my cover, eh?

44:50.000 --> 44:54.100
What the fuck are you doing?
And why don't you ever answer the phone?

44:54.100 --> 44:56.100
I'm sorry, right? It was vandalised.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.900
Why hasn't Plinston sent the nordle? I've got
things to do. I'm fighting a fucking war.

44:59.800 --> 45:04.000
It's coming in tomorrow
on the Frankfurt flight.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Make sure it gets there before 5 p.m.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.700
It has to be on the first
Aer Lingus flight to Shannon. OK?

45:09.600 --> 45:13.700
- I've got problems with a shift change.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, that's impossible.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.800
Just make it happen, brother!

45:15.800 --> 45:19.300
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck it!

45:28.900 --> 45:30.600
Taxi!

45:34.500 --> 45:37.200
? Lazy!

45:37.100 --> 45:39.200
? Could have stayed in bed

45:40.200 --> 45:45.500
? You don't want no money
You don't want no bread

46:12.100 --> 46:14.600
Get him an ambulance.
Don't you move now.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.500
We'll have an ambulance and tow truck
down here for you in no time.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.600
Ssh, just relax there now, boyo.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.300
Can't believe he's all right.

46:24.500 --> 46:27.200
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.700
I'm all right, I'm all right.

46:31.500 --> 46:34.200
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm OK.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.900
- Come on there, boy. Come on.
- I'm all right!

46:37.900 --> 46:41.800
- Come on, boy.
- Look at me, man. I'm standing!

46:53.800 --> 46:57.100
- Sorry, what's this pub called?
- Bernard Murphy's!

47:02.900 --> 47:04.500
- Hello.
- Jim, it's Howard.

47:04.600 --> 47:08.300
I'm at Bernard Murphy's.
I've had an accident.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.100
Can you come and get me?

47:10.200 --> 47:14.100
Some fucking operator you are.
You can't even drive a fucking car.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.100
Hey, hey, my porno!

47:21.400 --> 47:22.600
Wahey!

47:23.400 --> 47:25.400
Whoa.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.500
I need a drink. Can I get a drink?

47:31.300 --> 47:33.400
Whoa.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.700
Hello? Hello?

47:50.700 --> 47:53.700
Anybody here wanting a call from Archie?

47:53.700 --> 47:56.200
Karachi. Yeah, me.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.200
Thanks.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.500
Please insert £5.50.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.000
Karachi? That's in Pakistan, isn't it?

48:10.800 --> 48:12.200
- Malik?
- The same.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.500
- Has the nordle left?
- No.

48:14.500 --> 48:18.000
They don't eat spaghetti.
They'd like to use chopsticks

48:18.000 --> 48:20.600
or they'd like to eat wurst
or smorgasbord.

48:20.600 --> 48:22.300
Is the curry house still open?

48:22.300 --> 48:25.000
Closed due to uninvited guests.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.600
We have to shift it to the coats.

48:26.600 --> 48:30.500
The hairy coats.
I just can't get them to go for spaghetti.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.000
When can I serve the wurst?

48:32.100 --> 48:35.800
Oh, Christ! Malik, I'm out of change.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.600
- OK, OK!
- Put 'em in, put 'em in!

48:41.000 --> 48:43.100
Shit, he's gone!

48:43.100 --> 48:44.700
What Malik meant was

48:44.700 --> 48:48.400
that the shipment would have to come
from Kabul in Afghanistan

48:48.400 --> 48:51.800
as Karachi in Pakistan was blocked,
due to a war.

48:53.100 --> 48:56.400
- Jim!
- Hey, Howard, take one of these.

48:56.300 --> 48:59.100
We're gonna do this
with military precision,

48:59.100 --> 49:01.100
with the grace of a Mozart concerto.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.200
When I pick up the nordle from Shannon,

49:03.200 --> 49:06.500
I want you to wait here alone
in the farmhouse with one of these, OK?

49:06.600 --> 49:09.900
Now, when I'm on my way
I'm going to send you a coded message,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.300
something like, uh,
"I've got the nordle."

49:12.900 --> 49:14.000
What's the point of that?

49:14.100 --> 49:17.900
So you'll know precisely what time I'm
delivering the nordle, you stupid Welsh prat.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.600
- Why do I need to know precisely?
- Do as you're fucking told.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.200
- I've got no time for games. You know that.
- There's a war on in Pakistan...

49:24.200 --> 49:26.800
There's a fucking war here.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.400
Last Sunday, youse Brits
killed 13 innocent lrishmen in cold blood.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.100
You think you've got problems...

49:36.600 --> 49:39.200
I got you the cock films.

49:39.200 --> 49:41.200
About fucking time.

49:41.200 --> 49:43.800
- Let's watch one now.
- All right.

49:43.900 --> 49:47.400
Got a projector?

49:47.400 --> 49:49.500
Patrick!

49:50.200 --> 49:52.300
Get your fucking arse in there.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.500
Shh!

50:03.000 --> 50:05.100
Try this one.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.700
Phwah! Sure, that's the fucking lavvy.

50:08.800 --> 50:12.400
Telegram for Ballinskelligs.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.200
Nordle served late with wurst.

50:15.200 --> 50:16.500
Go on!

50:17.600 --> 50:20.300
It's in here somewhere.

50:20.300 --> 50:23.600
N-O-R-D-L-E.

50:23.500 --> 50:26.800
There it is. There. Now, careful.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.200
..Wurst: W-U-R-S-T.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.700
Come on. Go on.

50:53.700 --> 50:57.700
Go on.

50:59.700 --> 51:02.200
I've got a telegram for you, sir.

51:02.200 --> 51:05.400
Howard, you're letting in the light.
Shut the fucking door.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.600
Go on! Oh!

51:10.000 --> 51:11.500
There's a problem.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.500
The nordle's not going to be in Frankfurt
on time to be loaded onto our flight.

51:15.400 --> 51:20.000
It has to, Howard. I've told you
a dozen times, Eamonn's got shift changes.

51:19.900 --> 51:23.500
- We're gonna have to write this one off.
- Shut the fuck up.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.600
I'm trying to watch the wee lass. Go on.

51:31.900 --> 51:33.500
Oh! Oh, no, stop.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.600
OK, OK, that's it. Get a beer.

51:38.700 --> 51:42.500
OK, I'll get the fucking nordle, but I want
50 quid a pound, given the extra hassle.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.300
- Forget it, Jim.
- Put it this way.

51:44.400 --> 51:48.500
You pay me 50 quid a pound or I rip off
the whole fucking lot and become a legend.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.300
Aer Lingus.

51:58.600 --> 52:02.400
This is your man Jim McCann
of the Provisional lRA.

52:03.300 --> 52:06.100
The boys just put a bomb
on the next flight to Shannon.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.100
You have 20 minutes.

52:10.300 --> 52:11.800
That'll slow the fuckers down.

52:26.700 --> 52:28.600
Howard, are you there?

52:29.600 --> 52:31.700
Howard, come in.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.600
Howard!

52:36.900 --> 52:39.800
Pull up the aerial, ya prick!

52:39.800 --> 52:41.600
- Howard!
- Hello?

52:41.600 --> 52:43.300
What are you fucking doing?!

52:44.100 --> 52:45.200
Come here!

52:45.300 --> 52:48.900
- Press the button.
- Jim. Jim.

52:49.600 --> 52:53.000
- Jim!
- I've got the nordle. I've got...

52:52.900 --> 52:56.100
- I've got...
- Come in. Jim?

52:56.200 --> 52:57.800
- Listen...
- What are you doing?

52:57.800 --> 52:59.700
I can hear you the other end of the field.

52:59.700 --> 53:01.800
You fucking idiot!

53:03.200 --> 53:05.800
- It's on, the aerial's up.
- Piece of fucking shite!

53:05.800 --> 53:08.900
Look. It's not even on, Jim.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.400
Why the fuck is my name on the boxes?

53:15.200 --> 53:18.200
It's not. It says...
No, it's Juma Khan.

53:18.200 --> 53:20.700
Juma means Mister or something
in the Middle East,

53:20.600 --> 53:24.200
and Friday means...
No, Khan means Friday.

53:24.200 --> 53:28.000
Look, Juma Khan
might mean Man Friday in Kabul,

53:28.000 --> 53:31.600
but here in lreland,
Jim McCann means it's fucking me, the Kid!

53:40.300 --> 53:43.900
- OK.
- Come on. You wee beauty.

53:56.700 --> 53:58.600
Right.

53:59.400 --> 54:01.600
You see, Howard,

54:01.600 --> 54:03.200
the Kid's done it.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.700
I've done it. The Kid has done it!

54:08.700 --> 54:10.800
Right.

54:19.100 --> 54:21.300
- Well?
- Hang on.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.800
Oh, Jesus.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.500
Come on.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.300
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

54:45.700 --> 54:48.700
- What do you think?
- It's...

54:50.600 --> 54:52.600
It's shite.

54:56.400 --> 54:59.500
No, no, no, no, no.
Careful, careful, careful!

54:59.400 --> 55:02.000
Oh, shit. It's fucking explosives.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.400
Oh, fucking hell, Jim.

55:04.400 --> 55:06.400
What about the peace and love thing?

55:06.400 --> 55:08.500
You only deal in nordle. Nordle is fiction.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.500
Arms and explosives are non-fiction.
That's reality.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.600
I deal in non-fiction,
not this fucking hippy shite.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.500
- Pull over here, please, sir. Thank you.
- Yes.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.900
Thank you.
Can I see your passport, please, sir?

55:50.800 --> 55:53.500
It's not my passport. It's your passport.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.600
So are you Dennis Howard Marks?

55:55.700 --> 55:57.800
I am.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.900
Will you step out of the car, please?

56:02.200 --> 56:04.200
- Hello, boy.
- Stand over there, please, sir.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.500
Get Major in there, in the front.

56:06.600 --> 56:08.500
Round the back there. Go on.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.700
So, what was the purpose of your visit?

56:10.700 --> 56:13.700
Erm... Studying beneficial herbs.

56:13.700 --> 56:18.100
- Trying to take the piss or what?
- I've a huge respect for customs officers.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.700
Course you have.

56:19.700 --> 56:21.100
Boys, get on with it.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.600
Hope you're gonna
pay for the damage, boys.

57:16.700 --> 57:19.200
Passport, sir.

57:23.600 --> 57:28.700
I never went through Customs any more
with anything I didn't want them to find.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.900
Gentlemen,

58:13.900 --> 58:18.300
this is what banking is all about.

58:20.700 --> 58:23.300
Thank you. Thank you.

58:45.600 --> 58:48.600
Fuck off!
You're driving me, both, fucking crazy!

58:48.600 --> 58:50.600
It's supposed to be a fucking holiday.

58:50.700 --> 58:53.800
What's the fucking problem?
I told you about her.

58:53.700 --> 58:57.300
I told you everything about her and you said
it was fine for her to fucking come.

58:57.400 --> 59:00.300
Come here! Fuck!
Don't fucking walk away from me.

59:01.200 --> 59:04.100
Take the fucking sulk off your face,
you fucking wee bitch!

59:04.100 --> 59:07.400
Get in the pool. Have some fucking fun!
Come on!

59:07.400 --> 59:09.900
We're on holiday. Come on!

59:09.900 --> 59:11.400
Fuck you! Howard?

59:11.500 --> 59:13.400
- Morning.
- Do you have a pen?

59:14.000 --> 59:15.300
Judy?

59:15.400 --> 59:16.700
- Judy?
- Yeah.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.700
Morning, Jim.

59:19.700 --> 59:21.800
Woo hoo! Hey hey!

59:21.800 --> 59:24.700
I'll show you what we used to do
when we were wee kids. Look at this.

59:24.700 --> 59:27.700
- Oh, fucking hell.
- It's great fun. Look look, look.

59:27.700 --> 59:30.800
Look. Hang about, look.
Just a little wee eye there.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.700
Oh, Jim!

59:32.800 --> 59:35.000
There's the wee mouth. Judy?

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
Give the wee Kid a kiss!

59:38.000 --> 59:41.700
- Give the wee little Fox a kiss!
- Fuck off, man.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.400
- Ah, you wee shite!
- Wipe that smile off your cock.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.600
I can't fucking swim, you fucking cunt!

59:48.600 --> 59:52.400
- Fucking wanker.
- He's all right, man. He's having a laugh.

59:53.200 --> 59:57.300
My grandfather, Patrick Murphy,
was a Catholic policeman in Belfast.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.200
- He was murdered by the fucking lRA.
- Well, he shouldn't have joined the police.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.700
- He doesn't mean any harm, Patrick.
- He's a sociopathic liar.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.700
Look, it doesn't matter if you lie all the time.
Just take it into account.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.900
I just wish there was another way.
Listen, I've been thinking.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.800
We should ditch all this small-time shit
and get into the American market.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.300
- Why?
- The numbers.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.600
Listen to me.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.000
Consumption of hashish and marijuana
in the UK is about three tons a day.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:29.600
In the USA, they smoke 28 tons
every day of the year.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.900
Now, most of it is cheap Mexican weed
that sells for 200 bucks a pound.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:39.100
But good hash, like ours,
it costs one thousand bucks a pound.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.600
- Wow!
- No.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.900
No. No way.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.100
No way. No fucking way.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.900
- What's the difference?
- The Yanks.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.400
- They'll come after you, Howard.
- They're not gonna come after me.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.400
Patrick, don't encourage him.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.600
It doesn't make any difference anyway.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.200
I can't figure out
how you'd get it across the Atlantic.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.700
You'd need a fucking huge crate.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.100
You see, when a band tours America
with their gear, they're not importing it.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.300
They get this thing called a carnet.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.700
A sum of money
that's deposited with Customs,

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700
which is retrieved again
when the equipment leaves the country.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.400
Customs tear the docket off the paperwork
and wave it through.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.300
- Do the band know?
- Who gives a fuck?

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.400
Hello.
Hi.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.400
Hello. Welcome.
Welcome to California.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.100
- Thank you.
- You found us.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.700
- Ernie Combs. Good to meet you.
- Howard.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.400
Welcome to
the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400
Thank you.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:48.700
We will, uh...
Well, we'll keep the west coast, uh, stoned.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.700
I was wondering
when you were gonna introduce me.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.400
- Here we are.
- Hello, there.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.900
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Howard.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.000
Patti. It's great to meet you.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.400
You're a very lucky man, Ernie.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.600
Well, you know, we're, uh...
we're all lucky here.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.300
We don't dig any of this, like,
possession jealousy vibe.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:17.200
- How are you?
- I'm well. How are you?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.500
Hey. ¿Cómo estàs?

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.900
I'll be right back.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.100
Mmm. Don't be long.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.400
- Ernie.
- Oh. Uh, Howard,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.900
your load should hit Vegas
at some point this evening,

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:36.700
so then you can come on by
and pick up the dough, man.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.600
I was rather hoping
I'd get the money upfront, you know?

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.400
- Right.
- So I can get going.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.500
Yeah. Um...

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.400
I... Look, I'm... I'm sorry, but...

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.700
This...

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.600
I-It has to be...

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:58.600
You show me...

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.600
the dope...
and I show you the money.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600
It's all right, it'll work out.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.200
The load transited in
John F Kennedy Airport, New York.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.800
Hey, man, I love the Floyd.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.400
When the airport loaders
put it on the plane to Vegas,

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.100
they fucked up and left one speaker behind.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.600
What we got here?

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.700
- Hello, guys.
- Hello.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.600
- What have you got?
- No prints, no suspects, nothing. Just dope.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.700
The load was headed to Las Vegas.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.700
Send this puppy on to Vegas.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.000
I'll go along for the ride
and we'll see if anyone comes to pick it up.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.100
The speaker's that case.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.100
Cocksuckers.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.700
Let's go and bust it.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.600
Well, sir, you gonna help me?

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.600
It's all right, pig, I'm just
a dude picking up speakers.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.000
All right, darling?
Can I be of assistance, gentlemen?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.300
- Police! Get down!
- For fuck's sake!

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.800
Get off! Get off!

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.900
? You walked out of my life...

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.600
And of course,
the year starts with a parade.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.900
Hey, one of you guys out there
has just lost five million bucks.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.800
Today, law enforcement officers seized
Nevada's biggest ever haul of illegal drugs.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.900
Hashish, highly concentrated cannabis
from the Middle East,

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.800
almost half a ton of it, was discovered,
hidden in speaker cabinets.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.700
In the movies,
the crook, usually a fugitive,

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:33.300
always immediately switches off the radio
or television when the bulletin finishes.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.300
I didn't. I stared at it blankly
for at least an hour.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:41.000
This was Hollywood.
It probably wasn't even happening.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.900
- Would you like red or white wine?
- Oh, I'll have red, please. Thank you.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.900
Lovely. I just went to a party last night.
Left the keys at home.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.000
Here, Scotland Yard detectives say
they expect to make more arrests today

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.800
on an international police operation

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.800
which is said to have smashed
a major drugs ring.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.400
In all, 22 people have been arrested
in the United States, Britain and Spain.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.300
At least four of the arrests were made here.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.800
A report from home affairs correspondent
Bill Hamilton.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.000
Your Honour, bail is out of the question
for the defendant.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.100
He has money stashed in foreign
bank accounts. He is likely to abscond.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.600
He is facing a possible 14 years under
Section 20 of the Misuse Of Drugs Act 1971.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.700
Your Honour, there's something
I can't reveal in open court.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.300
We know you've been meeting a member
of the Provisional lRA who supplies arms.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.900
And we know why you've been meeting him.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.300
We'd like you to carry on meeting with him.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.700
We've had a lot of difficulty infiltrating
the lRA. You've done a pretty amazing job.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.900
This business with the Yanks.

01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:25.200
It's a bit too much, though, Howard.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.100
I'm afraid they've got their knickers in a
twist.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.700
Well, what should I do?

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.900
Well, we can try and pull a few strings

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.900
and perhaps let them know
quite how important you are to us.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.600
But you will, of course, owe the office
a substantial debt of gratitude,

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.900
if you know what I mean?

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.200
When are you next going to see McCann?

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.200
- Mac.
- Hmm?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.600
The lRA don't know
he's been involved with dope.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.700
- They'll execute him if they find out.
- C'est la guerre, Howard.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.700
People ask me... They say, "It looks like
a glamorous life, being a drug dealer."

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.200
"It looks like a lot of fun."

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.800
And I reply, "Don't do it unless
you are prepared never to be a grass."

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.100
Quid pro quo.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.899
However, appearing to cooperate
is another matter.

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:20.000
Bail is granted for sureties totalling £50,000.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.800
Mam and I will do what we can
to put up the bail,

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.200
whatever you did.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.500
But, erm...

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:33.600
did you have anything to do with
hard drugs and guns?

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.000
No, Dad. Course not.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.500
- Who is it, Mam?
- I don't know. Can I help you?

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.800
I think you better come with us.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.600
- Tell Judy I'll be back, OK?
- Where are you going?

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.500
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta go.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.900
- What about your coat, love?
- Who's this bloke?

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:06.400
- How long will you be, Howard?
- I've gotta go, Mam.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.200
I'd staged my own abduction
so my dad wouldn't forfeit the bail.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.300
You don't forfeit bail
if you've been kidnapped.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.800
I'm Chief Superintendent Fairweather
from ClD

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.400
and I'm looking for Howard Marks.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.200
- This is the room.
- Ah. Thank you.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.800
Please, no. No, don't touch that.
That is my son's private writing.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.100
The person who came to the door,
the way you've described him,

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.200
it sounds very much to me like, erm,

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.600
an image that we've seen on the television.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.800
- Is it?
- Balaclava, you know. Yes. The lRA.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:49.300
So now Eddie Laxton, intrepid reporter
for the Daily Mirror, is onto the story.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.400
What I don't want you to do is,
I don't want you to sensationalise it.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.700
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We're talking about our son here.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.800
- We're talking about our son, you know.
- Your son's more like a Robin Hood.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.200
Read all about it! LRA abduction!

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.900
The next morning, I woke up famous.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.100
Hello, mate.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.200
I was now being pursued
by the lRA, the DEA,

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.800
Customs and Excise, the police

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.900
and the press.

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:29.500
This is a British
black propaganda exercise.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.200
I admit I've been running guns to the North,
but I've never touched dope.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.300
I don't approve of it.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.200
Oi, it's you! That's you!

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.800
Oi, oi, it's Howard Marks. He's here.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.100
He's here. This is him.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.500
It's the man!

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.900
- The man!
- Cheers, everyone.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.500
Yes!

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.900
- Thank you.
- Cheers, mate.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.700
- Cheers, mate.
- Shh, now, right?

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:00.500
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
I'm on the run, see.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.500
Mmm, I love you so much.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.900
I love you.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.900
I love you so, so much.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.100
I love my girls.

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:42.200
Oh, baby. Oh, baby. For ever!

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.600
For ever.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:55.300
We got a beaten-up old camper van
and our life became a perpetual holiday,

01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:00.800
though Judy often complained that we had
to park too near the camp site's toilets,

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.400
because the telephone box
was invariably in the vicinity.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.500
Howard?

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.500
Y-Yes, I am... I am relieved
to hear from you now.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.700
And I can get the goods in from anywhere,

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.800
provided that it's smell-proof,

01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.100
and, uh...

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.300
on that particular ltalian airline.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.800
So can you do it?

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.000
- I need to be paid, DH Marks.
- I've only got a hundred quid, Malik.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.900
- That's nowhere near enough.
- A hundred quid is all I've got right now.

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.000
But there'll be more, Malik. Much more.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.400
We're gonna be rich, Malik, all right?
I promise you.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.200
Look, we're spending now,
but the more you spend, the more you get.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.900
You see, if you wanna keep
the rivers of money flowing,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.300
you've got to encourage it to, you know,
froth and bubble and ebb...

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.900
What shit are you talking, DH Marks?
Get me the money.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.000
Ever had your tarot read?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.100
- No.
- Sit down.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.100
What's your date of birth?

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.100
- Fifth of September, 1947.
- And where were you born?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.800
- Norwich.
- I see a woman.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.700
- That must be Mother.
- Yes.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.700
- Is she called Margaret?
- No. Anne.

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.500
Hmm. Well, before she was married,
was her maiden name...

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:39.600
Brown. Her maiden name was Brown.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.700
With this information, I could apply for
a provisional driving licence, join a library.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.800
Do you travel much? Ever been abroad?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.700
No. I don't trust foreign beer.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:55.100
I could even get a British passport
from the post office.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.600
I'm sorry. I can't see you.

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:02.300
Will it help if I tell you my name?
I-It's Donald.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.600
My name's Donald Nice.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.600
N-I-C-E, like the place in France.
On the Riviera?

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.500
It was up to Donald
how he pronounced his name,

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.500
but I was about to become...

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.000
Mr Nice.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.400
Three days later, 500 kilos of Afghan black,
some of the best hashish in the world,

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.600
was flown from Kabul,
via Frankfurt and Shannon, to New York.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.300
It was being smoked in Greenwich Village
the next day.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.500
I was very rich.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.600
Yes!

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.400
? God is a concept

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.600
? By which we measure

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.800
? Our pain

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.700
? I'll say it again

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:16.300
? God is a concept

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.800
? By which we measure

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.500
? Our pain

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.300
? Yeah

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.100
? Pain, yeah

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.500
? I don't believe in magic

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.100
? I don't believe in I Ching

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:50.000
? I don't believe in Bible

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:56.200
? I don't believe in tarot

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.600
? I don't believe in Hitler

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.100
The next six years were the best of my life.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.800
Apart from the preoccupation
with false identity,

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.200
there was little to indicate I was
Britain's most wanted fugitive from justice.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.300
I was very popular and had a lot of friends.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.500
They knew who I was and I was aware
that any one could turn me in at any time.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:24.900
I just bigheadedly assumed
that anyone who knew me liked me,

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.300
and wouldn't do such a thing.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.700
I've got money. I've got real money.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:31.800
I'm one of the shakers and the movers
in the film business now,

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:33.600
living life in the fast lane!

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600
What's it about, then, the film?

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.800
It's about a wee lad
who falls in love with a horse.

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:42.800
Gets a little boner for a fucking pony, eh?

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.400
- What's the film called?
- Equus.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.500
? I don't believe in Elvis

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.400
? I don't believe in Zimmerman

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.600
? I don't believe in Beatles...

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.900
Will you marry me?

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.900
Will I marry...

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.900
..Donald Nice?
Or one of your other aliases?

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.200
You choose, love.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.300
Are you serious?

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.300
Yes, I am.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.800
I'd only want to marry you as you.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.500
You know I can't do that right now.

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.200
Then I can't marry you.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:50.600
? ..The dream weaver, but now...

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.200
You're doing well. Just breathe deeply.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.300
Keep your breathing up.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.700
? I was the walrus

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.100
? But now I'm John

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.600
? And so, dear friends...

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.700
- Can I take your name?
- Mr and Mrs Nice. Booked a double room.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.700
? The dream is over

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.200
I'd just imported enough
Colombian marijuana into the UK

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.800
to get every inhabitant
of the British lsles stoned.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.500
Would you go down to the bar?
She won't settle with you hovering.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.300
- Are you going to leave them here alone?
- No, the hotel gave me an intercom.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.500
- We can finally have a quiet dinner.
- See you down there.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.700
Keep the change.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.400
Thank you, sir.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.100
That's a nice watch. Can I see it?

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.600
We are Customs officers
and we're arresting you.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:15.500
All right.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.000
Judy!

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.900
Jude.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.300
Donald Nice. Is that your name, sir?

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.400
Yeah.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.900
What do you do for a living, Mr Nice?

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.000
I'm training to be a customs officer.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.100
Howard,

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:58.800
will you marry me?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.300
You wanna marry me now?

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.400
I could be banged up for 14 years.

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.100
I'll wait.

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.600
Howard and Judy...

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.200
- We'll be right outside.
- Thank you, boys.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.400
Howard. I can't talk to you.
We cannot liaise with criminals.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.200
Dope smuggling is hardly a crime.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.300
Of course it is. Don't talk rot. It's illegal.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:09.000
I thought we agreed hashish
shouldn't be illegal. It's the law that's wrong.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.100
Goodbye.

01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.100
With your leave, my Lord,
I'd like to call the defendant.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.500
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.500
I do.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.600
I'd like to ask you, if I may, to explain
to the court your involvement with Ml6.

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:52.500
In 1972, I was recruited by Ml6

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.400
to catch lRA arms smuggler
James McCann,

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.300
by sucking him into dope deals.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:03.400
I was doing rather well
until Her Majesty's Customs and Excise

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.500
messed up the secret service's plans
by arresting me.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:11.000
Bail was arranged. I skipped, as arranged.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.300
The media, however,
had procured confidential information

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.200
that I was an Ml6 agent,
and my cover was blown.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.100
And knowing no other life than that of a spy,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.400
I was instructed by Ml6
to work for the Mexican secret services,

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:32.100
who, strangely enough, were also interested
in James McCann, due to their belief

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.300
that he was aiding Mexican terrorist group
September 23rd League

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:40.900
in arms acquisition,
fundraising through dope deals.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.900
And in order to fulfil my dangerous mission,

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.300
I involved myself in dope deals.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:55.800
Mr Marks, you are using
a little bit of the truth and then glossing it.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:24:00.900
It is conceded
that Marks was recruited by Ml6

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.000
for three months in 1973,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
by someone who was indiscreet enough
to ask for his assistance.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.600
But the rest is a myth,

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.400
mounted by him as a smokescreen,

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.900
while he was indulging
in very high-level drug trafficking.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:25.000
Let me challenge you to produce
this member of the Mexican secret services,

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:26.900
who you say recruited you.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.500
- Is what is written on this paper your name?
- Yes, your Honour.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.300
My Lord, should the jury
not see that document?

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.000
He would rather they did not.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.800
So what opportunity will you give me
to check on your credentials?

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:59.300
None, your Honour.
It's a matter of national security.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:06.100
Your Lordship will recognise that matters
of quite clearly spurious national security

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:09.400
cannot be permitted to intervene
on the prosecution's case.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.800
My Lord, the defendant was challenged
to produce this witness and he has done so.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:20.800
- Did you try to recruit this man here?
- Yes, I did.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:26.200
I gave him $150,000.
I can't tell you why, your Honour.

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.100
It's a matter of national security.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:33.600
What nobody knew was
that the Mexican was, in fact, a real cop

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.400
who was a buddy of Ernie Combs.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:39.200
This was committing perjury
on a grand scale.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.700
Was anyone really gonna buy all this?

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.200
Has the jury reached a verdict
upon which you are all agreed?

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.900
Yes.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.400
Will the defendant please stand?

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:17.700
Members of the jury, how do you find
the defendant? Guilty or not guilty?

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.400
Not guilty.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.300
Mr Marks, you are free to go.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500
Thank you.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.700
- Rey!
- This way, sir.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.100
Whoa!

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.900
- Promise me you'll never deal drugs again.
- I promise.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.900
- Look me in the eye and say it.
- I promise.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.400
The city of Palma is a delightful mixture of
medieval, ltalian and Moorish architecture.

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.200
People smoke hash in the streets,
the weather is perfect.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.700
We figured we could live here.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.500
I set up a wine import business.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.800
Meticulous accounts were maintained,

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:22.800
and national insurance, income tax,
graduated pensions,

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:28.100
corporation tax and value-added tax
were most conscientiously paid.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.500
I was very busy and very straight.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.700
I was also very bored.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.500
Aw, flip.

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.100
Was that wrong?

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:43.000
What should you do
when someone offers you drugs?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Just say no!

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.500
What will you do
when someone offers you drugs?

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.000
Just say no!

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.600
- I can't hear you.
- Just say no!

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.600
- Ah, DH Marks! How are you, my friend?
- Are you all right?

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.500
- Good to see you.
- Enjoy the flight?

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500
- Ah, it was OK.
- Yeah? Tired?

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.600
I am a bit tired, actually.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.400
Bit thirsty and hungry as well.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.700
Oi!

01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.600
Are you waiting for me? Yeah?

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.100
Did you get the picture?

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.200
- DH Marks, you are the absolute limit.
- Don't panic.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:04.100
We just got some coordinates.

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:09.900
We have latitude North 063504.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:16.400
Longitude, we have West 1525302.

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:29.200
- Hey!
- Ernie.

01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.900
- ¿Cómo està? Hey!
- Ernie boy.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.100
I just got tickets for this play tonight.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:37.700
I just got them right now.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.300
- It's the first, you know. It's the first.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.000
The first! The first! The first!
Fuck it, the first!

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.400
Unfortunately, I can't...

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.400
go to the... show tonight,

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.500
because of this testing thing.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.300
- Talk to Patti.
- Howard.

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.400
Hey, Patti!

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:07.300
- So I can open the champagne?
- Here, in my room.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.500
God bless Afghanistan.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.700
Full house. Stellar reviews.
Get here for the next matinee.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.100
Adios. Thank you. Enjoy yourself.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.100
Afghanistan!

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:23.200
Hey.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:28.500
Hey. Me Joseph, you Mary.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.900
- Baby Jesus.
- All right.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.100
Baby. Hey, come here.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:42.700
- Freeze!
- Raise your hands. Don't move.

01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:46.300
Calm down. Calm down.

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.000
? Hello, hello

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.300
Fuck.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.600
Howard, answer the phone.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.500
Let it ring.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.100
- Hola.
- Howard?

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:16.800
Hey, Patrick! Here, you wanna
speak to your new nephew?

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.400
- A friend of yours has a little problem.
- Oh, really?

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.700
A medical problem, Howard.

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:25.200
Erm... The ambulance came and got him,

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.700
and hauled him off to the hospital,
him and his wife.

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:30.000
- Are you OK?
- I don't know.

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:33.100
Look, the thing is, Howard,

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.400
he was bitten by the dog.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.800
- Your dog.
- M-my... My dog is sick?

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.500
- Your dog has rabies.
- OK, erm...

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.500
Patrick, I-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna call you back, right?

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.200
In a couple of hours. I'll call you back, OK?

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.400
- Howard, call me.
- OK.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.500
Are you Patrick Lane? You're under arrest.

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:34.000
- The girls don't wanna go. Nor do I.
- Listen, we'll enjoy it when we get there.

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:37.200
- I'm tired.
- You like curry. You love it.

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.000
Yes, you do.
We can do a poppadom smash.

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:41.700
You'll spend ten minutes eating curry.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.300
Then you'll be in Taki's bar
and I'll be stuck with the kids.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:49.000
One, two, three...

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.000
Poppadom smash up! Cornflakes!

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.800
Our favourite bit!

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:01.300
War on drugs.
What the fuck is a war?

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:04.200
How can you declare war
on a fucking drug?

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:09.500
It's a plant.
Most drugs are derivatives of plants.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.900
How can you declare war on fucking plants?

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:14.000
- Howard, why don't you stop?
- Stop what?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.800
- Just stop.
- I'm feeding my family, right?

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:20.100
I'm scared.
Scared they're gonna bust you.

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.200
They're not gonna bust me here.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:27.000
Don't be scared. Listen, listen.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.500
Look at this. I don't wanna lose this.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.600
I wanna be a husband and a father.

01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:39.600
I don't wanna miss out on that.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.100
You know, I was gonna slow up.

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:47.200
Now I'm...
Already I'm a middle man now.

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:51.500
You know? In two years' time we'll be...
we'll be legit.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.500
Really?

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.700
Really.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.300
Angel, my angel.

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.600
I love you.

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.800
I love you so much.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:12.300
Hey!

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:14.400
Stop... that.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.200
I've got to make a phone call.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.300
Hello.

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.800
Hello?

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.200
- Amber, pour me the juice. I can't get it.
- Come on, girls.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.700
Amber, pass the orange juice.

01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:11.800
Hey, don't touch Daddy's box, OK?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.100
Hello?

01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.700
Oh, Dave. Yeah, yeah, I'll buzz you in.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.000
Oi, oi!

01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.200
It's not exactly tennis weather, is it?

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:35.400
Well, you never know,
it might brighten up a bit.

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.400
Yeah. Mmm.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:41.900
- But if not, I'll get something warmer on...
- Put something on and come in for a spliff.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.300
See you in a minute.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.200
See you in a minute, girls.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Hello. Can I help you?

01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:13.400
Tranquillo. Tranquillo.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.600
- OK.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.700
Hey, hey, hey!

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.800
Let's have him now.
Come on, bring him to the car.

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.900
Vamos.

01:36:53.900 --> 01:36:56.000
- Judy.
- Vamos.

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.100
I wanna see my wife and children
before I go.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.800
- I wanna see my wife and children.
- Later.

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:09.000
- Dave.
- What's going on here?

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:14.300
- What's going on?
- Just see the kids are OK, and Judy, OK?

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.900
No!

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:36.900
In Britain, the United States, Spain and
other countries spanning three continents,

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:39.600
the men who wage war
against the drug traffickers

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:42.700
have been celebrating the success
of Operation Lynx.

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.000
After more than two years of undercover
work, it's culminated in a series of arrests

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:51.700
and the smashing of what's being called
one of the world's biggest drugs rings,

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.700
a ring allegedly masterminded by a Briton,
Dennis Marks, who is aged 43.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:59.100
This afternoon, he, his wife
and another British citizen

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.800
appeared in court in Palma, Majorca,
where they've been living.

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:04.800
They face extradition to the United States.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.700
We're an innocent couple with a family.

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:12.800
All we want... We just wanna be with our
children. We wanna be with our children.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:17.200
There is no reason in the world why my wife
should be locked up in this establishment.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:21.700
She has committed no crime. The children
are with their aunt at the moment.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.100
Of course,
we're both desperate to see them.

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:29.900
It looks as if Marks and the others
will be extradited to Miami within days.

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:33.300
Spanish police have cooperated fully
with both the investigation and the arrests.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.900
Spain is unlikely to act as a haven.

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.000
- Please state your name for the record.
- Patrick Lane.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.600
No way can I become a snitch, a grass,

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:54.700
a chivato, a stool pigeon, a squealer,

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:58.700
a rat, a traitor, a wrong 'un,

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:02.500
a betrayer, a Judas.

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:06.200
How would you describe your function
in the Marks cartel?

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.700
Guilty.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.500
In your witness statement, Mr Malik,

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.000
you suggested that you were responsible
for creating in factories in Afghanistan

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.100
hashish that was distributed by Mr Marks.
Is that true?

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.000
- Guilty.
- Mr Malik, please.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.800
We expect that you will answer the question
to the best of your ability.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:26.200
Please answer the question.

01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.900
- Could you repeat the question, please?
- Yes.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Mr Malik,

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:34.900
what was your role in the Marks cartel?

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.900
- Guilty.
- Who did you take your orders from?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.500
- Guilty.
- Your Honour...

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.200
This behaviour
will not be tolerated in my court.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.200
In your opinion, Mr Lane, would you say

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:56.400
that this business constituted
a drugs organisation with a hierarchy?

01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.700
Most definitely.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.100
And was there somebody
at the top of this hierarchy?

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.200
- Yes.
- Who would that be, Mr Lane?

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.000
It would be Howard Marks.

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:09.300
Could you please point
to the head of this cartel?

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.900
For the record, I'd just like to point out
that he's addressing Mr Marks.

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.900
Yes, we have that on the record, thank you.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.100
And in your understanding, Mr Combs,

01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:25.300
who was it you were actually dealing with
in the Marks cartel?

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.000
That would be Howard Marks.

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.700
Would you mind pointing to Mr Marks,
Mr Howard Marks?

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.600
For the record, your Honour,
I'd like to point out who he's pointing to.

01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.700
Yes, we have that on the record, thank you.

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:41.700
Would you mind pointing to Mr Marks?

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:46.800
Uhh... does the defence have any questions
for this witness?

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.100
No.

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.600
No physical contact.

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.500
You may hold hands. You have 20 minutes.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.700
Hello, love.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:11.100
What's wrong with your hands?

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.500
It's just...
It's just an allergy or something. Stress.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:23.700
Are you OK?

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:32.000
There's a problem. With the kids.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.700
Wh...

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.100
Asha's boyfriend's become a junkie.

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.800
- He spends his time beating them.
- No.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.600
They've left little Patrick locked in his room.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.400
No. No. No.

01:41:51.900 --> 01:41:54.800
Amber said he threatened her
if she opened the door.

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:59.100
- No, no.
- She screamed and screamed.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.100
No, no, no.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.500
But it's all right now. It's all right.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.500
- But I need to be with them.
- I know. I know you do.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.700
Please.

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:22.800
- They need me.
- I know, Judy. I know.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:26.500
Come on, Howard.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.100
Come on, plead guilty.

01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.500
Plead guilty and we'll let Judy go home.

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:44.000
You've gotta stop using her like this.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:47.400
Think of your children.

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.400
The pain.... they're suffering.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:02.300
Then again,
I could always appear to cooperate.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.600
Have you heard of a man
named James McCann?

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.800
Fucking Christ.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.300
Stop my fucking car?

01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:16.800
You don't know
who you're fucking dealing with!

01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.600
I'm the Kid! Look at the Kid go!

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.700
Got you covered.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.200
- Hands in the air!
- Don't make a move.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.200
I am Captain James McCann

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.800
of the Provisional lrish Republican Army.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:38.300
And I am surrendering
to tools of the British Empire,

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.800
and I demand the status of prisoner of war.

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.300
This'll be a grand story
in the bars on St Paddy's Day, fellas, eh?

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.300
How you helped out the fucking Brits!

01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:54.300
I'm the Emerald Pimpernel!

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:07.900
This is the case of the United States
versus Howard Marks,

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.500
I see that Mr Marks is present.

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:12.200
Would the defendant please rise?

01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:19.300
Mr Marks, federal statutes
prohibit trafficking in marijuana.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.400
I have taken an oath to administerjustice,

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.600
and to perform all duties
agreeable to the laws of the United States.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:33.100
So, even if I were, uh, to agree

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:37.500
that the laws concerning
the use and sale of marijuana

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.100
were inappropriate, even foolish,

01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:45.800
I would have to abide by them
until Congress has repealed them.

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.800
I impose the following sentence.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:52.100
As to Count One of the indictment,
for a term of ten years.

01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:54.500
As to Count Two of the indictment,

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.700
a term of fifteen years.

01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.900
Sentences to run consecutively,

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:06.400
for a total of twenty-five years.

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.500
Case is dismissed.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.400
Doing time began to get hard.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.300
I'd been down for four years
and I had more than another twelve to do,

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.500
as seemed certain
I would be denied parole.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:26.300
Judy couldn't wait for me that long.
No one could.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:29.700
At the age of 60,
I would re-enter the world,

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:34.900
skint, full of hate,
and completely unemployable and useless.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:38.400
I would be old and ugly.
No one would want to shag me.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.000
I caught shingles
and had several bouts of flu.

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.000
Smoke and phlegm filled my lungs.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.800
I couldn't piss properly.
I couldn't bend my left leg.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.300
I had pains everywhere.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.600
Abscesses filled my gums.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.400
Jesus Christ!

01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.300
God! Make it fucking stop!

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.300
Please.

01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:13.800
Please help me. Please help me.
Please help me.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.000
Shh!

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.400
Oh, fucking hell.

01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:26.200
I can't feel a fucking thing.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.200
Daddy...

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.500
Daddy's coming...

01:46:50.200 --> 01:47:02.500
Daddy...

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.400
I was given the job
of teaching English grammar

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.200
to prisoners studying
their General Education Diploma.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:19.400
Most of my pupils were looking at
the rest of their life behind bars.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.400
An inmates' teacher, if not cautious,

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:25.600
could find himself regarded
as a semi-hack orjailhouse snitch.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.600
I was scared,
but I applied the usual rule.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.300
Never show your fear.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.300
41526004,

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:38.000
you can call me Howard.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.400
And so I became the jailhouse lawyer.

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:43.400
I wrote to congressmen, judges, lawyers,

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:47.500
had some successes,
got convictions overturned.

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.100
To whom it may concern...

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.500
US lmmigration would not allow Judy
back into the country to visit me

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.800
because she had a conviction.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:00.000
But that could not stop the kids.

01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.700
I thought Amber was Judy.

01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:25.400
When I finally saw Francesca,
she looked like my memory of Myfanwy.

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:30.200
Myfanwy wanted to share
her sixteenth birthday with me.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.700
I had five days of heavenly visits.
I loved them so much.

01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:42.000
Since he joined the education programme,
these kids, some got out.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.600
Even those that are staying
have learned to read, to write...

01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.900
There was no reason whatsoever
to think that anything had changed

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.500
with respect to the big dope dealers
never being granted parole.

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.200
But I went through the motions

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.200
and turned up in the prison
parole hearing rooms

01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:00.000
to present my case
on the last day of January 1995.

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.600
Mr Marks, due to evidence that
the recommendation you spend

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.000
the majority of your sentence
in the UK was ignored,

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:09.800
because of pleadings by the DEA
for you to remain in Terre Haute

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.700
your sentence has turned out harsher
than the court originally intended.

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:17.500
In light of this, I am recommending to the
United States Regional Parole Commission

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.900
for you to be released on parole
on March 20th.

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:33.200
Thank you.

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.600
C-Can I call home please?

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.600
It's OK.

01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:36.900
Like I said, are there any plain-clothes
policemen in the audience tonight?

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.000
Thank fuck for that.

01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:58.300
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:50:59.100 --> 01:51:02.100
Pass it over to me

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.000
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:51:09.700 --> 01:51:12.400
Pass it over to me

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.400
Roll another one

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:23.800
Just like the other one

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.900
You've been holding onto it

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:34.000
And I sure would like a hit

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:40.800
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:45.100
Pass it over to me

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:51.200
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:55.400
Pass it over to me

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:20.600
Roll

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:24.300
Another one

01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.500
Just like the other one

01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.000
That one's just about done to the end

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.300
So come on, be a real friend

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:43.800
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.400
Pass it over to me

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:54.900
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:58.900
Pass it over to me

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:03.400
Come on, everybody, now.
Sing along now

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:08.200
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.700
Pass it over to me

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.800
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.700
Pass it over to me

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:29.500
Don't bogart that joint, my friend

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:37.400
Pass it over to me?
