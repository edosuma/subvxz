00:20.080 --> 00:21.789
Hi.

00:21.790 --> 00:23.379
Hi.

00:23.380 --> 00:24.959
Have you seen Seth?

00:24.960 --> 00:26.829
No. Okay, cool.

00:26.830 --> 00:28.419
If you see him, can you
tell him I'm looking for him?

00:28.420 --> 00:30.209
Yep, no problem.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.249
Are you looking for Leonard?

00:31.250 --> 00:32.459
No, Seth.

00:32.460 --> 00:33.460
I'm gonna call him.

00:33.461 --> 00:34.499
He doesn't have his phone.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.420
I have his phone.

00:35.421 --> 00:36.579
Why do you have Leonard's phone?

00:36.580 --> 00:37.789
No, she's gonna call Seth.

00:37.790 --> 00:39.579
I'm calling Roger.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.789
About Leonard or Seth?

00:40.790 --> 00:41.790
Where are you?

00:41.790 --> 00:42.710
Where are you?

00:42.711 --> 00:43.789
What are you doing?

00:43.790 --> 00:44.829
What are you doing?

00:44.830 --> 00:45.919
I'm picking up the tickets.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.079
I have the tickets.

00:47.080 --> 00:47.880
What tickets? Where are you?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.619
Who is that? Jill.

00:49.620 --> 00:50.789
Yes?

00:50.790 --> 00:51.829
Can you ask her
if she's seen Jay?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.209
Yeah, he's right here.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.829
Is that Seth? Can I?

00:55.830 --> 00:57.790
Hey. Hey.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.079
Hey. Hey.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.210
How's it going?

01:03.790 --> 01:05.419
Has he seen Leonard?

01:05.420 --> 01:07.169
He's right here.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.290
What are you all doing here?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.169
There's something weird
going on.

01:11.170 --> 01:12.669
Yes. I'm looking at...

01:12.670 --> 01:14.499
Wait, why did you just say yes?

01:14.500 --> 01:17.289
Because I'm looking at your
office standing in my office.

01:17.290 --> 01:19.879
I'm looking at your office
standing in my office.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.209
Is this like the Herschel Walker
trade of the Southern District?

01:22.210 --> 01:24.079
Is he in your office
or this office?

01:24.080 --> 01:25.499
Herschel Walker.
He played football.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.959
He was traded from
the Dallas Cowboys

01:26.960 --> 01:27.710
to the Minnesota Vikings.

01:27.711 --> 01:28.959
18 players.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.379
They basically swapped teams.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.789
I don't follow sport.

01:31.790 --> 01:34.289
"Sport"? Who says "sport"?

01:34.290 --> 01:36.919
God, you did a semester
in England, didn't you?

01:36.920 --> 01:38.329
University of East Anglia.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.669
How long did you have an accent
when you got back?

01:39.670 --> 01:40.919
Two years.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.249
That's why you drink tea.

01:42.250 --> 01:44.619
No. I drink tea because
it's calming.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.039
Really? I find all
the leaves stressful.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.999
I'm worried I'm gonna
swallow a leaf.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.419
Have you tried meditation?

01:50.420 --> 01:51.619
Who has time?

01:51.620 --> 01:53.079
They say you only need a minute.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.289
Who says that? I don't know,
the meditation lobby.

01:55.290 --> 01:56.670
Sandra!

01:57.960 --> 01:59.379
Yeah, I'm seeing it here, too.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.380
Bye. Bye.

02:01.710 --> 02:02.879
It's good to be home.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.420
Why are you holding two phones?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.288
Okay, good news...

02:08.289 --> 02:09.919
Andrew and his husband
just got matched

02:09.919 --> 02:11.579
with a baby girl to adopt.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.079
- Wow!
- Amazing!! So happy for them.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.419
So that means we all
need to pitch in

02:14.420 --> 02:15.999
and help him out
while he's gone.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.209
- We're here.
- Anything. -Of course.

02:17.210 --> 02:20.619
Obviously, the big thing
is the Betty Baker trial.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.709
That's Andrew? Did not realize.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.419
Right now,
she's just being tried

02:24.420 --> 02:26.879
for the East Midtown
Mutual Bank robbery,

02:26.880 --> 02:28.539
but if you've even
glanced at a tabloid

02:28.540 --> 02:29.879
in the last six months,

02:29.880 --> 02:31.119
you know they suspect her

02:31.120 --> 02:33.919
in a string of other robberies
around Manhattan.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.830
It's a tough case.

02:34.831 --> 02:36.579
Facts are bad.

02:36.580 --> 02:38.249
Government isn't
offering anything.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.709
And there's
a sympathetic eyewitness

02:39.710 --> 02:40.789
who was shot in the bank.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.670
And the trial starts
in two days.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.249
I have a verdict coming in,
unfortunately.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.789
Love Andrew,
but I'm buried right now.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.460
So happy for him and Dan.

02:54.330 --> 02:55.879
Don't be nervous.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.499
Easy for you to say.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.619
How many bombs did you
diffuse in Kandahar?

02:59.620 --> 03:01.289
One too few.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.419
Well, more than anyone
on that jury.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.749
They're gonna find me guilty.

03:04.750 --> 03:05.789
We don't know that.

03:05.790 --> 03:07.879
You have a good story.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.249
That I cashed my dead mom's
Social Security checks?

03:10.250 --> 03:12.169
That you shed blood
for your country

03:12.170 --> 03:14.329
and your injuries
meant unemployment,

03:14.330 --> 03:16.079
which was nowhere
near sufficient...

03:16.080 --> 03:17.619
Which has nothing to do
with their verdict.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.459
That has everything to do
with your sentence.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.669
You are a veteran.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.999
You do not deserve
to be put in a position

03:23.000 --> 03:24.829
where the only way
you could afford

03:24.830 --> 03:25.879
to put a roof over your head

03:25.880 --> 03:27.499
was to commit a crime.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.829
Even if the jury
finds you guilty...

03:28.830 --> 03:30.249
And I'm not saying they will...

03:30.250 --> 03:35.119
The judge will understand
what you've been through.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.380
I feel good about this.

03:37.540 --> 03:38.540
Guilty.

03:40.540 --> 03:43.209
Remember,
this is not the ballgame.

03:43.210 --> 03:45.459
Mr. Hardin, we're gonna
set a sentencing date.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.999
At that time, I will consider
any arguments your lawyer

03:48.000 --> 03:49.959
wants to make on your behalf,

03:49.960 --> 03:52.079
but having heard the evidence
against you,

03:52.080 --> 03:53.329
I do want to be clear...

03:53.330 --> 03:55.709
What you did
was deceitful and wrong.

03:55.710 --> 03:57.709
It requires a penalty
that will send a message...

03:57.710 --> 03:59.579
To deter this kind of conduct

03:59.580 --> 04:02.209
and address the seriousness
of your crime.

04:02.210 --> 04:03.789
Sounds like Judge Guillotine.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.459
It's Gallatin.
No, it's Guillotine.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.539
The way you're saying it,

04:07.540 --> 04:08.919
it sounds like the thing
with the heavy blade

04:08.920 --> 04:10.039
that chops off heads.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.999
Last time I was in front
of Guillotine,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.209
he sent my client to prison

04:13.210 --> 04:14.289
because he said
it was time for her to

04:14.290 --> 04:15.789
"learn a little life lesson."

04:15.790 --> 04:17.079
She was 91.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.879
Great.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.168
What am I gonna do?

04:20.170 --> 04:22.169
This might be time for you
to consider film school.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.959
Thank you for the vote
of confidence.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.829
A sentencing mitigation video.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.209
A video.

04:27.210 --> 04:30.119
A short film to show
Chris' story in images

04:30.120 --> 04:32.999
in a way you can't
in briefings and arguments.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.999
This is a real thing?
Absolutely real.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.459
And incredibly effective in
the right situations. Okay.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.209
Well, the last movie I made

04:40.210 --> 04:42.249
was this little spy camera
I set up in the laundromat...

04:42.250 --> 04:44.169
No, no.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.039
You need a professional for this.
Even better.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.379
Someone who knows
how to use music,

04:49.380 --> 04:51.829
narration, real emotion.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.709
Who do I contact?

04:53.710 --> 04:54.829
No idea.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.419
Well, what kind of budget
do we have?

04:56.420 --> 04:57.420
No budget.

04:57.421 --> 04:58.789
I've heard about these,

04:58.790 --> 05:00.039
but so far as I know,

05:00.040 --> 05:01.329
nobody in this office
has actually made one.

05:01.330 --> 05:02.749
I'm sorry.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.289
You just got me excited
about something I can't do.

05:05.290 --> 05:06.379
Possibly.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.919
If you do go down this road,
though,

05:08.920 --> 05:12.289
and I really think you should,
it should be good, tasteful.

05:12.290 --> 05:14.040
Otherwise,
it can really backfire.

05:15.210 --> 05:16.619
Let me know how it goes.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.209
Tasteful?

05:18.210 --> 05:19.670
Me?

05:24.670 --> 05:26.669
Have you ever been to Paris?

05:26.670 --> 05:28.039
It's on my list.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.249
Illinois.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.119
Paris, Illinois.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.539
No. Is that... really a place?

05:33.540 --> 05:36.169
I'm not judging.
I'm from Sacramento.

05:36.170 --> 05:40.459
It's a place
where nothing happens.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.749
What got me through
was knowing that someday

05:42.750 --> 05:44.789
I would move to New York.

05:44.790 --> 05:46.169
I felt like when I got here,

05:46.170 --> 05:49.039
that's when my life
would really start.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.379
And now...

05:50.380 --> 05:52.249
You're here.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.919
I know.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.170
I'm sorry.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.539
I've been getting up to speed
on your case, Betty,

05:59.540 --> 06:02.709
and I see two big hurdles
for us in this trial.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.379
One is the receipt
found at the bank

06:04.380 --> 06:06.329
that was traced back
to your credit card,

06:06.330 --> 06:08.379
and the other is
the eyewitness testimony

06:08.380 --> 06:09.789
from the man who was shot.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.119
We can fight the receipt.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.829
I feel confident about that,

06:12.830 --> 06:16.709
but the eyewitness will
be... more challenging.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.209
It's one person.

06:18.210 --> 06:19.619
Yes, but if he's credible...

06:19.620 --> 06:22.040
How credible can he be
if he's lying?

06:23.170 --> 06:25.540
I don't trust anyone anymore.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.379
I completely understand.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.539
I was like that, too.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.919
What changed?

06:32.920 --> 06:35.329
I guess I did.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.749
I realized people
on the other side

06:37.750 --> 06:39.710
can also be on my side.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.039
Yeah, that's crazy.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.169
You were right the first time.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.620
Don't trust anybody.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.919
Hi! Hi!

07:22.920 --> 07:24.579
I love your shoes.

07:24.580 --> 07:26.289
You can't see my shoes.

07:26.290 --> 07:28.289
I don't need to see them
to know I love them.

07:28.290 --> 07:30.669
I could be wearing those shoes with the
articulated toes. No, you couldn't.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.289
Your taste is way
too good for that.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.619
Weird time to admit
I own a pair?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.999
Can I help you with something?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.379
They're actually great
for natural foot motion.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.959
Is this another side business?

07:37.960 --> 07:40.329
I remember you were peddling
water filters at one point.

07:40.330 --> 07:41.879
That was my dad.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.709
If you're interested,
we still have 10,757 left.

07:44.710 --> 07:45.710
What do you want?

07:45.711 --> 07:47.379
So, we have a client... "We"?

07:47.380 --> 07:49.379
And our client
is being sentenced,

07:49.380 --> 07:51.499
and Jill recommended
a sentencing video,

07:51.500 --> 07:54.329
which is why I need you.

07:54.330 --> 07:55.999
I don't know how
to make a movie.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.289
Neither do I, but at least
you know about movies,

07:58.290 --> 08:00.039
and what's your favorite movie?

08:00.040 --> 08:01.119
"Lost in Translation."

08:01.120 --> 08:02.579
No idea what that is.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.879
My favorite movie
is about a talking St. Bernard,

08:03.880 --> 08:05.249
and it's not "Beethoven."

08:05.250 --> 08:06.619
Beethoven didn't talk.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.539
Really?

08:08.540 --> 08:10.379
I do have a friend
in film school.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.039
Of course you do.
I'll introduce you,

08:12.040 --> 08:13.789
but we are not doing this
together.

08:13.790 --> 08:14.750
Hey, do your thing.

08:14.751 --> 08:15.879
Just let me be a fly
on the wall.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.500
No, I mean,
I'll introduce you, but...

08:19.960 --> 08:21.669
Listen, it's either
help me on this,

08:21.670 --> 08:24.289
or you get dragged
into her trial.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.580
You have to lose the shoes.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.669
This is Kate.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.039
Hey, it's me.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.919
Have you sent over
a witness list yet?

08:37.919 --> 08:40.419
Not yet. Okay.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.249
I'm obviously under a bit
of a time crunch here.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.379
Right, I realize that,
which is why, I mean,

08:45.380 --> 08:47.789
technically,
I'm not even required...

08:47.790 --> 08:49.379
Never mind.

08:49.380 --> 08:52.539
I'll get it to you
within the next two hours.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.419
Great. Thank you so much.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.619
And the trial exhibits?

08:55.620 --> 08:57.499
Yes. On their way. Fantastic.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.500
Thank you!

09:22.880 --> 09:23.999
This is Sandra.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.579
I just want to confirm
that defense

09:25.580 --> 09:28.079
does not plan to file any
additional motions in limine?

09:28.080 --> 09:29.789
Not as of yet.

09:29.790 --> 09:32.329
Does that mean defense
is still considering some?

09:32.330 --> 09:34.379
No, it just means that defense,

09:34.380 --> 09:36.499
meaning me,
still has time to decide.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.499
I will file them on time.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.499
What do you mean by "on time"?

09:40.500 --> 09:42.379
Kate, no motions, okay?

09:42.380 --> 09:43.709
Okay. Thank you.

09:43.710 --> 09:44.880
I'm 95% sure.

09:58.750 --> 10:02.379
Agent Brentano, can you please
look at Government Exhibit 4

10:02.380 --> 10:04.170
and explain to the jury
what it is?

10:06.330 --> 10:10.999
It's a receipt in the amount of
$14.72 for Taqueria Isidoro.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.459
Have you seen
this receipt before?

10:12.460 --> 10:14.749
Yes, it was found... Objection.
Move to strike.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.459
The witness is answering a
question she wasn't asked.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.459
If Ms. Littlejohn wants to
know where it was found,

10:18.460 --> 10:20.669
she can ask her that.

10:20.670 --> 10:21.999
Thank you, Ms. Bell.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.749
Agent Brentano,
where was this receipt found?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.999
On the floor of the bank,
just after the robbery.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Do you know how it got there?

10:29.001 --> 10:30.879
- I believe it fell...
- Objection.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.539
No foundation. Speculation.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.619
Sustained.

10:34.620 --> 10:38.119
Agent Brentano, in reviewing
the evidence in this case,

10:38.120 --> 10:40.879
did you come to a conclusion
as to when and how

10:40.880 --> 10:43.289
this receipt came to be
on the floor of the bank?

10:43.290 --> 10:45.329
Objection.
It's a compound question.

10:45.330 --> 10:47.789
It is, and I appreciate
counsel's concern for precision,

10:47.790 --> 10:49.789
but I believe the witness
can answer both parts.

10:49.790 --> 10:52.749
Agreed. Overruled.
You may answer.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.579
In reviewing
the surveillance video,

10:54.580 --> 10:55.669
I was able to determine

10:55.670 --> 10:57.329
the receipt fell
during the robbery.

10:57.330 --> 10:58.419
How did you determine

10:58.420 --> 11:00.329
that this receipt
belonged to Ms. Baker.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.169
Objection.
Misstates the testimony.

11:02.170 --> 11:03.830
Assumes facts not in evidence.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.289
I found a meditation app.

11:21.290 --> 11:23.080
Should we try tomorrow at lunch?

11:24.710 --> 11:26.959
That witness doesn't matter.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.420
They all matter.
Only one matters.

11:33.580 --> 11:36.119
Andrew had this case for weeks.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.459
You've had it for a few days.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.119
This loss is gonna go to him,
not you.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.580
Everyone knows that.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.619
Tomorrow at lunch.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.620
Let's do it.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.119
Mr. Loomis,
can you please tell the jury

11:58.120 --> 12:01.419
what happened after you entered
East Midtown Mutual Bank?

12:01.420 --> 12:03.209
I was waiting for the ATM

12:03.210 --> 12:05.709
when I saw this woman enter
with her head down.

12:05.710 --> 12:09.289
She had one of those
ski caps bunched on her head.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.329
She was beautiful.
What I saw of her.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.039
I stared for a second,

12:14.040 --> 12:16.959
and then she saw me
and pulled on the mask.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.419
Turned around again,

12:18.420 --> 12:20.619
and that's when I saw
the gun in her hand.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.169
And what happened next?

12:22.170 --> 12:24.539
There was... chaos.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.079
It all happened so fast.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.619
I saw the security guard
getting ready to make his move,

12:29.620 --> 12:32.329
so naturally I tried to
get out of his way.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.789
That's when she shot me.

12:33.790 --> 12:36.079
Where did she shoot you?
In the stomach.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.209
Mr. Loomis, is the woman
who shot you at the bank

12:38.210 --> 12:40.710
here in this courtroom today?

12:48.460 --> 12:49.960
No.

12:51.210 --> 12:54.459
Mr. Loomis, are you sure?

12:54.460 --> 12:55.999
Yes.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.749
Isn't it true that the
defendant, Ms. Baker...

12:57.750 --> 12:59.379
Objection, the question
has been asked and answered.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.039
I am asking
a different question.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.079
If the question is about
the identity of the person

13:03.080 --> 13:05.079
who shot the defendant,
it's the same question.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.829
Ms. Littlejohn, I'll allow you
another shot at this

13:06.830 --> 13:09.579
if you rephrase it in
an appropriate way.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.919
Mr. Loomis, when you
were interviewed

13:13.920 --> 13:16.499
by FBI Agent James Wellner,

13:16.500 --> 13:20.039
did you identify someone
you believed responsible

13:20.040 --> 13:23.580
for shooting you
at East Midtown Mutual Bank?

13:24.790 --> 13:27.919
Yes, I did.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.079
When I looked at
her photographs,

13:30.080 --> 13:34.079
I thought it was the woman
sitting there, Ms. Baker.

13:34.080 --> 13:38.119
But seeing her now, in person...

13:38.120 --> 13:39.789
I was wrong.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.250
It wasn't her.

13:47.540 --> 13:50.539
Weeks of preparation, and
suddenly he isn't sure Betty

13:50.540 --> 13:51.999
was the person who shot him? The
bank robber's named "Betty"?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.379
I'm headed this way.
I'll see you later.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.879
I had a pet hedgehog
when I was a kid.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.329
Guess what its name was. Betty.

13:56.330 --> 13:57.459
Nope. Sonic.

13:57.460 --> 13:58.380
No. Do you want another guess?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.290
No. Bill Clinton.

13:59.291 --> 14:00.539
What about him?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.619
My hedgehog's name
was Bill Clinton.

14:02.620 --> 14:04.119
How would I ever guess that?

14:04.120 --> 14:05.999
That's why I gave you
three chances.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.209
Anyway, Bill Clinton died
when I was 12,

14:08.210 --> 14:09.999
I buried him in the backyard,
we had a funeral,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.169
I presided over it
and everything.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.749
Why are you telling me this?

14:12.750 --> 14:15.289
Because I just found out that
Bill Clinton actually died

14:15.290 --> 14:17.120
while I was away at camp
when I was 10.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.579
My mom just bought
another hedgehog

14:20.580 --> 14:22.460
and switched Bill Clinton out.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.670
I couldn't identify my own pet!

14:27.750 --> 14:30.079
We went over his testimony
50 times.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.379
We showed him the photo spread.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.119
He identified her
without any hesitation.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.709
Nick was sure.

14:34.710 --> 14:36.749
I was sure I was burying
the real Bill Clinton.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.749
That's the point. Isn't the
point that your mom lied to you

14:38.750 --> 14:40.789
because she didn't want you to
know she killed your hedgehog?

14:40.790 --> 14:42.169
You know what? That hurts.

14:42.170 --> 14:43.250
Wait, that's it.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.579
You know what's happened
in the world since 1986?

14:46.580 --> 14:47.789
The Soviet Union fell.

14:47.790 --> 14:49.079
We cloned a sheep.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.579
Cars drive themselves,

14:50.580 --> 14:53.329
but the Mets haven't won
a World Series in 32 years.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.249
Rooting for the Yankees
is like cheering for Jaws

14:55.250 --> 14:56.619
or the German guys
from "Die Hard."

14:56.620 --> 14:58.539
Were they German?
I have no idea.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.879
His name was Hans.
Hans Solo wasn't German.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.079
That's, like,
an inter-galaxy thing,

15:03.080 --> 15:04.419
and his name was Han, not Hans.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.789
Either way, Yankees suck.

15:05.790 --> 15:07.210
Have a great trial.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.619
What are you doing?

15:10.620 --> 15:11.380
Waiting. For who?

15:11.381 --> 15:12.619
Jill.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.000
To exchange tickets.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.039
You have to exchange tickets
in the courthouse hallway?

15:18.040 --> 15:20.539
We tried it in the office,
but it got confusing.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.670
Long story.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.789
Look, I know this
is complicated,

15:31.790 --> 15:33.999
but you and Jill need
to move this along.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.579
Me and Jill need
to move what along?

15:35.580 --> 15:37.209
You and Jill need to move
you and Jill along.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.879
No. No, there's nothing going...

15:38.880 --> 15:40.669
I've known you a long time,
Roger.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.379
Until you met Jill,

15:42.380 --> 15:45.499
the only time I'd ever
seen you even smile

15:45.500 --> 15:47.619
was when Ronald Mark Wilson
was sentenced to death.

15:47.620 --> 15:50.289
He ate his math teacher.
I'm not apologizing for that.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.579
The point is,
you're not a happy person.

15:51.580 --> 15:52.879
Or you weren't.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.459
But ever since you've been
spending time with Jill,

15:55.460 --> 15:57.499
there's a light in your eyes.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.079
Now, I normally wouldn't
involve myself in this,

15:59.080 --> 16:00.419
but when you're happy,

16:00.420 --> 16:02.169
everything around here
is happier.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.669
I-I think you're exaggerating
a little...

16:03.670 --> 16:04.919
Hey!

16:04.920 --> 16:07.459
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.079
Judge Friedman brought his
Pomeranian to work again,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.249
and he ended up gagging
on a crispy shrimp burrito

16:12.250 --> 16:13.459
under the bench.

16:13.460 --> 16:15.209
The Pomeranian,
not Judge Friedman.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.710
Good news is I got
a continuance.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.749
This is a great moment for me.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.249
Working for us... for free?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.379
The chance to move people.
Through film.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.709
Well, I'm truly humbled to
be able to share my gifts

16:29.710 --> 16:30.670
with all of you.

16:30.671 --> 16:31.879
Just the judge.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.249
Tell me your vision for this.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.999
We need to get Judge Gallatin

16:35.000 --> 16:36.619
to feel for Chris at sentencing.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.209
To really understand him
as a person.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.249
Chris is a decorated
bomb specialist.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.879
He served two tours
in Afghanistan.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.789
He came back with a shattered
shoulder and a fused hip.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.539
He could barely hold down a job.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.419
So, when his mom passed away

16:49.420 --> 16:52.249
and her benefit checks
kept coming in the mail...

16:52.250 --> 16:54.499
he was just trying to survive.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.789
Service.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.669
Sacrifice.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.379
Survival. That's his story.

16:59.380 --> 17:00.380
Exactly right.

17:00.381 --> 17:01.619
I'm gonna get to
the heart of it.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.959
That's what we need you for.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.829
The beating, pulsing heart.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.039
Beating and pulsing...
Are those two things?

17:08.040 --> 17:09.540
I...

17:10.960 --> 17:12.579
Trust me.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.290
Has it been three minutes?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.289
42 seconds.

17:25.290 --> 17:27.789
No, that can't be right.
No... 44, 45...

17:27.790 --> 17:30.039
It's stressing me out.
I just want tea.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.499
Do not say "tea."

17:32.500 --> 17:34.669
I never realized how
many thoughts I have.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.619
Maybe we're just being
too ambitious.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.749
Three minutes is pretty
aggressive.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.039
One minute?

17:40.040 --> 17:41.579
I can do anything
for one minute.

17:41.580 --> 17:45.250
One minute it is,
starting... now.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.459
What if I don't want
to meditate for one minute?

17:54.460 --> 17:56.459
Who has the time?
We're in trial.

17:56.460 --> 17:58.290
Ridiculous. We tried. Yeah.

18:00.210 --> 18:04.119
Whatever happens in there,
that is in there.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.459
It isn't personal.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.119
Of course not. Not "of course."

18:08.120 --> 18:10.119
Well, it's not.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.379
I'm glad you said that, though.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.329
I was feeling bad because
of Nick's testimony,

18:13.330 --> 18:14.789
and if you want
to dismiss the case.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.749
Let's leave that inside.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.459
We're here now.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.460
Tomorrow? Same time.-

18:24.460 --> 18:25.829
Aren't you supposed
to be in court?

18:25.830 --> 18:28.119
On my way. I was meditating.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.749
Good. That'll come in handy.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.329
What is this?
From Kate's office.

18:31.330 --> 18:32.789
Is it a dismissal?

18:32.790 --> 18:34.619
It is not a dismissal.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.039
What is it?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.459
Security photos
from all the robberies

18:37.460 --> 18:39.329
they suspect Betty was involved in.
Why?

18:39.330 --> 18:41.249
She's not charged in any
of those robberies.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.289
You can't identify her
in any of these photos.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.619
No, but you can identify him.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.000
Who?

18:51.710 --> 18:52.830
My God.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.379
I was handed these photos

18:56.380 --> 18:57.999
minutes before
coming into court.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.709
I only discovered them
last night, Your Honor.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.119
Last night was last night.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.999
I turned over the evidence
as soon as it was practical.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.379
That is demonstrably untrue.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.329
It was deliberately withheld
until the last minute

19:08.330 --> 19:10.379
to gain a strategic advantage.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.829
Well, now, this is more
what I was expecting.

19:13.830 --> 19:15.669
Mr. Loomis is now cooperating?

19:15.670 --> 19:17.329
Yes, Your Honor.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.959
And there is an immunity
agreement in place?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.250
Yes, Your Honor.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.459
I'm surprised and unhappy

19:25.460 --> 19:26.579
with how long it took you

19:26.580 --> 19:28.580
to produce this material,
Ms. Littlejohn.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.329
This is where we are.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.419
I'll allow you to go forward.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.209
Your Honor, respectfully,

19:36.210 --> 19:38.459
this is a flagrant
Brady violation.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.209
I understand the objection,
Ms. Bell.

19:40.210 --> 19:41.579
We're moving forward.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.499
Ms. Littlejohn, you are on
a short leash here.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.789
Now. What exactly is Mr. Loomis
testifying to?

19:47.790 --> 19:50.039
Betty Baker was my girlfriend.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.419
We had been together a year

19:52.420 --> 19:54.419
when she first raised
the idea of robbing a bank.

19:54.420 --> 19:57.749
I thought she was joking,
but she wasn't.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.079
She was bored.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.079
She needed money.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.120
And she was very convincing.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.039
I went along with it.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.829
I was the scout. The lookout.

20:09.830 --> 20:12.329
And if we got into trouble,

20:12.330 --> 20:13.959
I was going to help us get out.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.919
Mr. Loomis, can you please
tell the jury

20:16.920 --> 20:22.209
what happened the day of the
East Midtown Mutual robbery?

20:22.210 --> 20:24.419
It started just like the others.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.539
The planning.

20:25.540 --> 20:26.789
But on that last day,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.379
on the walk to the bank,

20:28.380 --> 20:31.749
I felt something
different from her.

20:31.750 --> 20:35.289
She kept complaining that
she was doing all the work.

20:35.290 --> 20:36.499
I didn't understand
what that meant

20:36.500 --> 20:39.789
until we got in the bank
and she shot me.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.879
She wanted the money.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.419
You previously testified

20:43.420 --> 20:45.789
that you could not
identify the person

20:45.790 --> 20:48.329
who shot you in
the East Midtown Mutual Bank.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.210
Was that testimony truthful?

20:54.540 --> 20:56.750
No. It was not.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.419
Why not?

20:59.420 --> 21:00.620
Honestly?

21:02.670 --> 21:05.039
Because I love her.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.580
And I didn't want her
to go to jail.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.170
Even though she did
shoot me in the stomach.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.419
But this is the truth.

21:14.420 --> 21:16.540
Betty Baker was the woman
under that mask.

21:22.170 --> 21:23.669
How goes bank robbery?

21:23.670 --> 21:24.959
My witness turned on me.
Not good.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.460
But I turned him,
and he turned on the defendant.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.249
It's a lot of turns.
Are we back in the same place?

21:30.250 --> 21:32.000
No, we're in a better place.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.789
When did she tell you
this witness had turned?

21:35.790 --> 21:37.999
About 15 minutes
before he testified.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.039
That's a Brady violation. I
made this argument. I lost.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.329
If you want me to
get into this...

21:42.330 --> 21:45.539
And do what?
I can talk to Roger.

21:45.540 --> 21:47.209
You don't need to talk to Roger.

21:47.210 --> 21:48.919
She sandbagged me. I objected.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.419
I lost. I have to move on.

21:50.420 --> 21:51.749
This could be grounds
for appeal.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.959
Maybe, or maybe I win
and there is no appeal.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.000
I need to talk to Betty.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.749
Kings are the slaves of history?

22:04.750 --> 22:05.959
That doesn't sound like Chris.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.459
No. It's Leo.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.079
He didn't mention a Leo
in his unit.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.289
It's from "War and Peace."

22:10.290 --> 22:12.459
The narration
is from Leo Tolstoy?

22:12.460 --> 22:14.039
Every luminous word of it.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.499
Can you tell us what those
luminous words mean?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.959
It all depends on
who is watching.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.829
The judge is watching.
The judge.

22:20.830 --> 22:23.249
The crows that pick
at Chris' wounds,

22:23.250 --> 22:25.539
in the battle sequence...

22:25.540 --> 22:26.999
why are they in uniforms?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.959
Also, why are there crows?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.829
The fossil record
is rather dense.

22:30.830 --> 22:33.419
In the video... why are there
crows in the video?

22:33.420 --> 22:37.289
It's a spirit animal,
a symbol of death and destiny.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.079
In United States Army uniforms.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.749
A symbol of death and destiny.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.209
She has a good point.
This is federal court.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.419
Could we switch up the uniforms?

22:45.420 --> 22:47.249
How are they putting on
the uniforms?

22:47.250 --> 22:49.789
We may have to do that in post.

22:49.790 --> 22:51.669
Not my preference, of course.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.169
My friend Rusty takes his
Dachshund trick-or-treating.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.880
In costume. I'm just saying.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.539
This is insane. About adding
the uniforms in post?

22:59.540 --> 23:00.619
I'm worried about that, too.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.079
Doing any of this in any way.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.079
Spirit animals
and Russian novels?

23:05.080 --> 23:07.539
The brutality of war.
That is Chris' story.

23:07.540 --> 23:09.209
If he was enslaved by a King.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.169
No, see, the Kings are the ones
who are enslaved,

23:11.170 --> 23:12.669
burdened by...

23:12.670 --> 23:14.619
Look, I get where Theo's
headed with this. So do I.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.499
It's better than any
of the videos we've seen.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.379
Your cellphone pointed
at the ground is better

23:18.380 --> 23:20.119
than the videos we've seen.
What's your solution, then?

23:20.120 --> 23:21.499
With two days till sentencing.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.619
Something, anything that shows
the truth of Chris' life.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.539
Like the stuff I tried
to raise every day at trial?

23:27.540 --> 23:30.539
Or the cane he used in court
whenever he moved an inch?

23:30.540 --> 23:33.209
Judge Guillotine didn't care.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.669
Yes, Theo's taking a big swing.

23:35.670 --> 23:38.749
Chris needs one,
so let's get back in there

23:38.750 --> 23:41.750
and figure out how we are gonna
get the crows dressed!

23:44.330 --> 23:46.169
I didn't think he'd turn on me.

23:46.170 --> 23:47.829
After you shot him?

23:47.830 --> 23:49.919
I only shot him because
he was gonna shoot me.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.169
What are you talking about?

23:51.170 --> 23:52.709
He was reaching into his jacket.

23:52.710 --> 23:54.879
He had a gun, but the...

23:54.880 --> 23:58.379
The plan was only for him
to use it if I needed backup.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.379
There were no sirens, no cops.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.209
I was about to get away, just
like I had the other times,

24:03.210 --> 24:07.079
but then I saw his hand
in his jacket,

24:07.080 --> 24:09.459
the expression on his face.

24:09.460 --> 24:11.709
I just saw it.

24:11.710 --> 24:14.829
Saw what?

24:14.830 --> 24:16.879
That he didn't trust me anymore.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.119
And I didn't trust him.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.579
We'd started fighting a lot.

24:22.580 --> 24:27.919
We'd even argued on the way
to the bank that day.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.249
How much of the money
we could spend

24:29.250 --> 24:30.879
without people getting
suspicious,

24:30.880 --> 24:33.169
what was okay to spend it on,
what wasn't,

24:33.170 --> 24:36.419
what the long-term plan
was gonna be.

24:36.420 --> 24:41.619
He figured out the perfect way
to get rid of me,

24:41.620 --> 24:44.959
keep the money, and even
come out looking like a hero.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.210
So I shot him.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.380
We really did love
each other once.

24:53.500 --> 24:57.249
The mistake was going
into business together.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.329
What do we know about Nick?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.999
He's from Edina, Minnesota.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.539
Moved to New York
three years ago.

25:01.540 --> 25:03.669
He played the oboe in college.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.079
She told you she shot him? Yes.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.249
But the first time
you talked to her,

25:07.250 --> 25:08.709
she told you she
didn't shoot him.

25:08.710 --> 25:10.289
Clients change their stories
all the time

25:10.290 --> 25:11.829
for all kinds of reasons.

25:11.830 --> 25:14.829
I don't know which story of hers
is true, and I don't have to.

25:14.830 --> 25:16.669
Our job is to make sure
the government

25:16.670 --> 25:19.119
can actually prove their story.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.749
They have the burden.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.289
Who's that? Nick's sister.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.209
Every year, his family takes
a holiday photo inside a canoe.

25:27.210 --> 25:28.829
I can kinda see
why Betty shot him.

25:28.830 --> 25:30.169
What do we know about her?

25:30.170 --> 25:31.999
She was married to a man
named Luke,

25:32.000 --> 25:33.669
but he spells his name
without the "e."

25:33.670 --> 25:35.119
She's had
a lot of money problems

25:35.120 --> 25:36.499
since she moved
to New York last year.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.709
Any other pictures?

25:37.710 --> 25:40.380
Of Nick? Of his sister?

25:49.120 --> 25:50.419
No, you're not.

25:50.420 --> 25:52.579
I am.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.329
What choice do I have?

25:55.330 --> 25:57.290
We have to tell
a different story.

25:59.580 --> 26:02.419
Who is this, Mr. Loomis?

26:02.420 --> 26:04.419
That's my sister, Jenny.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.539
Are you close?
Objection. Relevance.

26:06.540 --> 26:08.539
I can assure Your Honor
this will be relevant.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.119
I'll give you a few more,
Ms. Bell.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.999
Mr. Loomis, you may answer.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.079
Yes.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.579
Your sister, Jenny,

26:15.580 --> 26:17.499
is five foot three inches tall,
is that about right?

26:17.500 --> 26:18.789
Yes.

26:18.790 --> 26:21.959
About 120 pounds? Yes.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.170
Brown hair?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.580
Yes.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.919
Isn't it true, Mr. Loomis,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.459
that your sister Jenny
is the one

26:30.460 --> 26:32.539
who robbed the East Midtown
Mutual Bank with you

26:32.540 --> 26:33.709
and not Betty Baker?

26:33.710 --> 26:35.039
What? No. Objection.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.709
Counsel.

26:36.710 --> 26:39.829
She has no evidence that Jenny
had anything to do with this.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.919
She doesn't need evidence.
She's asking questions.

26:41.920 --> 26:43.619
She's raising doubt.
That's her job.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.379
It's a cross. Your Honor,

26:45.380 --> 26:47.619
she's gonna leave the jury
with these wild accusations,

26:47.620 --> 26:49.119
and then she's gonna
rest her case,

26:49.120 --> 26:50.669
and then I will have
no ability to respond.

26:50.670 --> 26:51.879
That is correct.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.419
You are putting on a defense
you know is false.

26:54.420 --> 26:55.459
I don't know it's false.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.039
I wasn't there.
Neither were you.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.499
The only thing I actually know

26:58.500 --> 27:01.169
is that you withheld evidence
that you knew would help me.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.459
Ms. Littlejohn, is there an
objection you'd like to make?

27:03.460 --> 27:05.749
I object to her.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.080
Overruled.

27:11.170 --> 27:14.829
So, um, the bad guys
in "Die Hard" were German.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.329
But one of them was Russian.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.539
So, it's confusing.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.539
Yes.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.169
So, let's say I did want
to move this along with Jill.

27:22.170 --> 27:23.879
Okay, what direction?

27:23.880 --> 27:25.329
Forward. Yes.

27:25.330 --> 27:26.669
Like, living together.

27:26.670 --> 27:27.790
Right.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.289
How would you approach that?

27:31.290 --> 27:33.209
You were married, right?

27:33.210 --> 27:35.169
You proposed. Didn't go well.

27:35.170 --> 27:37.080
The proposal or the marriage?
All of it.

27:39.330 --> 27:42.290
Well, tell me what you'd say.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.459
So, listen... Sounds like
you're delivering bad news.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.120
Hold my hands.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.040
Look me in the eye.

27:57.790 --> 27:59.249
Call me by my name.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.499
Tina or Jill?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.879
Jill.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.209
Jill, I've been
thinking a lot...

28:06.210 --> 28:07.579
No, stop.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.669
Okay. Stop.

28:09.670 --> 28:11.419
Thinking a lot?

28:11.420 --> 28:12.959
Why are you thinking a lot?

28:12.960 --> 28:14.669
This should be easy.

28:14.670 --> 28:15.709
You're offending me.

28:15.710 --> 28:17.169
Are you Jill or
Tina when... Both!

28:17.170 --> 28:20.710
Go ahead.

28:22.790 --> 28:24.709
Jill.

28:24.710 --> 28:26.169
You make me happy.

28:26.170 --> 28:29.579
There isn't a day that goes by

28:29.580 --> 28:31.999
that I don't want
to talk to you.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.619
See you.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.539
Be with you.

28:35.540 --> 28:38.789
That I don't think of you
when I'm not with you.

28:38.790 --> 28:42.879
That I don't wish I'd met you
a long time before I did.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.919
That I'm not thankful
for any time

28:44.920 --> 28:46.290
I've gotten to spend with you.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.039
I want to live with you.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.080
I-I want to live together.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.500
I think it's lovely.

29:03.580 --> 29:06.039
Hey. Hey.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.959
Thanks for dropping off
the Jenkins dismissal.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.379
I appreciate it.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.079
Sorry about the mix-up
the other day.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.459
No problem.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.959
Is that a bird?

29:13.960 --> 29:15.619
In a uniform?

29:15.620 --> 29:17.419
We're making a sentencing
mitigation video,

29:17.420 --> 29:19.959
and I mistakenly
hired David Lynch,

29:19.960 --> 29:21.999
if David Lynch
was British and obnoxious

29:22.000 --> 29:24.039
and had no talent
and really loved crows.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.039
Aren't all those videos stupid?

29:26.040 --> 29:27.709
I mean, I think
the idea is okay.

29:27.710 --> 29:29.169
To manipulate a judge
with a movie.

29:29.170 --> 29:30.709
To do what we can to
humanize our clients.

29:30.710 --> 29:32.379
I guess this is one area
where prosecutors

29:32.380 --> 29:34.329
and defense attorneys really
see things differently.

29:34.330 --> 29:35.459
I'm not sure it's
all prosecutors

29:35.460 --> 29:37.459
and defense attorneys.
It might just be you and me.

29:37.460 --> 29:39.539
Those things are manipulative
and ridiculous.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.289
What's ridiculous about
telling a client's story?

29:41.290 --> 29:42.789
The fact that you're
not telling it.

29:42.790 --> 29:44.789
You're turning it into
a cheesy infomercial.

29:44.790 --> 29:46.619
Infomercials can be
very informative.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.169
If the facts spoke for
themselves,

29:48.170 --> 29:49.919
they wouldn't need mood lighting

29:49.920 --> 29:50.830
and a soundtrack by Enya.

29:50.831 --> 29:52.079
I like Enya.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
And the judge in this case

29:53.080 --> 29:54.000
didn't hear all the facts.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.210
Whose fault is that?

29:56.620 --> 29:59.169
My bad. We should just keep
this stuff out of the apartment.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.169
Yes, this is Switzerland.

30:01.170 --> 30:02.249
I don't have to
respect what you do

30:02.250 --> 30:03.670
to get along with you at home.

30:08.330 --> 30:10.419
Are you saying you don't
respect what I do?

30:10.420 --> 30:12.209
I didn't mean you specifically.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.879
So I'm a bad lawyer
and a cheap stereotype.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.789
I didn't say cheap.

30:16.790 --> 30:19.499
We're just talking about facts
versus production values.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.119
No. We're talking about
empathy for people

30:22.120 --> 30:24.329
versus being executed
by Judge Guillotine.

30:24.330 --> 30:26.829
It's Gallatin!
I know it's Gallat...

30:26.830 --> 30:29.039
You know, maybe just stay out
of my business here, okay?

30:29.040 --> 30:30.749
You're the one who asked me
to try to help you put

30:30.750 --> 30:33.040
a tiny uniform on
a stuffed bird!

30:35.210 --> 30:37.460
The pants don't even fit!

30:43.500 --> 30:46.459
Betty Baker walked into
East Midtown Mutual Bank,

30:46.460 --> 30:48.829
pulled a ski mask over her face,

30:48.830 --> 30:51.669
demanded money, and threatened
to kill whoever got in her way.

30:51.670 --> 30:53.499
When things didn't
go as planned,

30:53.500 --> 30:56.119
she turned on her boyfriend,
Nick Loomis, and shot him.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.459
Without hesitating.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.789
She didn't pause to see
if he was all right.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.669
She fled the scene

31:01.670 --> 31:03.919
so quickly that, in her haste,

31:03.920 --> 31:06.919
she dropped a receipt with her
credit card number on it.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.789
This is what happened.

31:08.790 --> 31:10.879
These are the facts.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.709
Ms. Bell wants you to believe

31:12.710 --> 31:15.459
that the truth in this case
is muddled.

31:15.460 --> 31:17.749
That the testimony you have
heard points to someone

31:17.750 --> 31:19.749
other than Betty Baker
robbing a bank

31:19.750 --> 31:22.079
and trying to kill her boyfriend
to cover her tracks,

31:22.080 --> 31:26.119
but that is simply untrue.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.669
Mr. Loomis is a flawed man

31:29.670 --> 31:32.669
who has made some very poor
choices and big mistakes,

31:32.670 --> 31:34.209
but none has been greater

31:34.210 --> 31:37.209
than the simple, essential,
elemental one

31:37.210 --> 31:40.420
of falling for the wrong person.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.419
Of believing someone
to be decent and honorable

31:45.420 --> 31:46.749
when she is not.

31:46.750 --> 31:50.209
In believing that a relationship
can be anything more

31:50.210 --> 31:52.119
than expedient and
transactional.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.539
That the person he trusted
was motivated by something

31:55.540 --> 31:59.330
other than avarice and anger
and self-regard.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.459
We don't agree on a lot.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.329
That's the nature
of this system.

32:09.330 --> 32:11.419
That's why we are here
talking to you

32:11.420 --> 32:13.419
from opposite sides of the room.

32:13.420 --> 32:15.040
To give you our perspective.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.879
The evidence as we see it.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.669
To let you decide.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.499
But Ms. Littlejohn
and I do agree

32:22.500 --> 32:24.579
on one important thing
in this case.

32:24.580 --> 32:27.119
The only important thing,
really.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.959
That what we do here
comes down to trust.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.289
Do you trust Mr. Loomis?

32:32.290 --> 32:33.419
That's it.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.959
If you do, you can
and probably should

32:35.960 --> 32:37.579
convict Betty Baker.

32:37.580 --> 32:42.789
If you don't, then you cannot
convict Betty Baker.

32:42.790 --> 32:44.669
Do you trust him?

32:44.670 --> 32:47.249
You know he lied.
He told you he lied.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.749
He came in here, and he looked
you in the eye,

32:49.750 --> 32:51.749
and he said, "I lied."

32:51.750 --> 32:54.709
That is the only thing you know
for a fact about Nick Loomis.

32:54.710 --> 32:57.619
That the government
offered him immunity,

32:57.620 --> 32:59.209
and he changed his testimony.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.459
That he is a liar.

33:01.460 --> 33:03.669
That he will say and do
whatever it takes

33:03.670 --> 33:07.119
to avoid responsibility
for his role in this crime.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.829
Ms. Littlejohn wants you to
focus on the relationship

33:10.830 --> 33:13.459
between Betty and Nick.

33:13.460 --> 33:15.419
I want you to think
about the relationship

33:15.420 --> 33:18.829
between Nick and you.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.999
You are good people.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.539
You believe things,

33:23.540 --> 33:25.669
and you fight for the things
you believe in,

33:25.670 --> 33:28.329
and you are honest
in that fight.

33:28.330 --> 33:31.539
Your friends and co-workers,
your fellow jurors,

33:31.540 --> 33:34.960
trust you because they
know what you believe.

33:36.750 --> 33:41.000
Nick Loomis is a man who doesn't
believe in anything.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.580
And how do you trust someone
who doesn't believe in anything?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.709
So, we've got to make this quick

33:56.710 --> 33:57.670
because I have
a hearing to get to.

33:57.671 --> 34:00.249
Hi. Hi.

34:00.250 --> 34:04.619
Okay, your charging documents
in the last two fraud cases

34:04.620 --> 34:07.579
have been inflammatory and
preposterously aggressive.

34:07.580 --> 34:10.119
Even for you. Um, you
like smoked fish, right?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.918
Yes.

34:11.920 --> 34:15.248
And you have this little weasel
first year over here

34:15.250 --> 34:17.418
who keeps badgering
one of my first years.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.748
I don't remember his name...
Barney Greengrass.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.039
I don't think that's it.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.998
No, I'm saying Barney Greengrass
tomorrow morning.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.119
Can you do it?

34:24.120 --> 34:26.039
Sure, yes, right.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.748
We can go together.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.958
Meet me here tonight.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.918
The Baker case.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.168
I'm sure you know,

34:34.170 --> 34:36.539
Kate Littlejohn withheld
Brady material...

34:36.540 --> 34:38.958
No, open it later.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.498
Okay.

34:40.500 --> 34:43.208
We're gonna appeal if we lose,
which we probably won't.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.119
Byrne left us an opening.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.880
Wait, what happened
in the Baker case?

34:49.170 --> 34:50.458
When you tell your story,

34:50.460 --> 34:52.539
I need you to tell it
as if it's happening now.

34:52.540 --> 34:53.879
Right here.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.329
My story? Your story.

34:55.330 --> 34:57.169
My whole life story is now?

34:57.170 --> 34:58.669
Here and now.

34:58.670 --> 34:59.879
I'm not sure I understand.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.289
Neither do I.

35:02.290 --> 35:04.249
You get it?

35:04.250 --> 35:06.459
Blue and the khaki, thanks.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.169
Should Chris shave as well?

35:08.170 --> 35:09.749
He won't be on camera for this.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.379
You're just using the audio?

35:11.380 --> 35:13.119
I won't be recording that,
either.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.999
It's to give me the emotion.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.419
I'm afraid I still don't
understand what to do, exactly.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.539
Thank God you're not a director.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.539
Just asking what I...
Why don't you stop asking,

35:22.540 --> 35:25.459
and let me start doing, okay?

35:25.460 --> 35:26.540
Thank you.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.249
I think it's time
for you to leave.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.379
Excuse me?
You need to leave, Theo.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.039
Now. This is about Chris.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.829
Not you. Not "your work."

35:40.830 --> 35:42.120
Which seems to be terrible.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.169
He used to be such a normal,
down-to-earth guy.

35:55.170 --> 35:56.959
Really? Freshman year.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.619
I don't know, maybe not.

35:58.620 --> 36:00.709
We're screwed.
We're totally screwed.

36:00.710 --> 36:01.710
We are.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.000
What?

36:47.330 --> 36:50.579
I'd like to take a break.

36:50.580 --> 36:54.669
Clearly, in light of this
powerful defense presentation,

36:54.670 --> 36:57.330
a prison sentence in this case
is unwarranted.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.749
When the door opens,

37:12.750 --> 37:14.040
I'm going in first.

37:25.290 --> 37:26.709
Have a seat. I don't have time.

37:26.710 --> 37:27.710
I'm waiting for a verdict.

37:27.711 --> 37:28.749
There's not gonna be a verdict.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.169
Sit down.

37:30.170 --> 37:31.459
What's going on?

37:31.460 --> 37:33.079
She's pleading out.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.079
Three years on the robbery,
and we dismiss the gun charges.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.119
I never offered a deal.
I offered it.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.829
I'm about to win this case.

37:39.830 --> 37:40.919
By withholding Brady material...

37:40.920 --> 37:42.999
Judge Byrne ruled with me.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.919
And if you win,
which you probably will,

37:44.920 --> 37:46.789
they're gonna appeal,
and we're gonna get slapped,

37:46.790 --> 37:48.209
and I'm not gonna let
that happen.

37:48.210 --> 37:51.079
You negotiated a deal with
Sandra behind my back...

37:51.080 --> 37:52.760
I negotiated a deal.
It wasn't with Sandra.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.079
I don't understand.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.329
You were gonna lose.

37:56.330 --> 37:58.249
I was not going to lose.

37:58.250 --> 37:59.709
When did she offer this?

37:59.710 --> 38:01.209
Who? Kate.

38:01.210 --> 38:02.539
This didn't come from Kate.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.039
Roger made me the offer.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.619
Are you kidding me?

38:06.620 --> 38:09.459
You took my case away
and cut a deal with Roger?

38:09.460 --> 38:10.460
Yes.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.540
What?

38:13.880 --> 38:15.540
You two are in a relationship.

38:18.790 --> 38:20.209
Sandra...

38:20.210 --> 38:21.919
You were with him
the night he was swatted.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.709
You're digging into
my personal life?

38:24.710 --> 38:26.169
This isn't about
your personal life.

38:26.170 --> 38:28.999
This is about
professional liability.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.289
You are the Federal Public
Defender.

38:31.290 --> 38:33.119
Your name is on every pleading
in this office.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.999
You represent every client
in this office,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.289
and you have a relationship

38:37.290 --> 38:38.829
with the Chief of
the Criminal Division

38:38.830 --> 38:40.579
of the U.S. Attorney's Office...

38:40.580 --> 38:43.119
I've had a relationship with
Roger Gunn for seven years.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.619
That relationship
has been different things

38:44.620 --> 38:45.829
at different times.

38:45.830 --> 38:47.079
I don't know what it is now.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.789
And it's not your business.

38:48.790 --> 38:50.289
We're not married.

38:50.290 --> 38:51.669
We have no entangling interests.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.209
You think I haven't
thought about this?

38:53.210 --> 38:55.119
This isn't about what I think.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.379
It's about the perception
of a conflict.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.209
What happens when some
disgruntled client

38:59.210 --> 39:00.329
finds out about this

39:00.330 --> 39:02.749
and alleges ineffective
assistance of counsel?

39:02.750 --> 39:04.249
Then they will lose

39:04.250 --> 39:06.379
because nothing I have done
or am doing

39:06.380 --> 39:08.829
is a violation of my
professional responsibility.

39:08.830 --> 39:10.000
You don't believe that.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.880
It's complicated...

39:12.881 --> 39:14.459
It's not complicated.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.169
You're having a relationship

39:16.170 --> 39:19.119
that compromises
your ability to do your job.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.619
And my ability to do my job.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.829
You want to know what I think?

39:22.830 --> 39:23.959
That is what I think.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.539
You're upset about this case.

39:26.540 --> 39:29.459
Yes. I'm upset about this case.

39:29.460 --> 39:33.289
I am upset because you
negotiated a deal with Roger,

39:33.290 --> 39:34.419
and I don't know if you did that

39:34.420 --> 39:36.169
because it was in the best
interest of our client

39:36.170 --> 39:39.499
or because Roger offered it.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.669
I'm upset because I don't know
if I can trust you.

39:42.670 --> 39:43.879
And it's not just you.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.539
It's... It's not just this case.

39:45.540 --> 39:48.119
I'm upset about everything
going on around here.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.419
Everything. Everybody. Me!

39:50.420 --> 39:53.079
Meditating in the park
with Kate Littlejohn.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.329
Jay and Seth living together.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.289
Everybody walking around
these offices

39:57.290 --> 39:59.419
like we're all one
big happy family.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.539
We are not.

40:01.540 --> 40:03.080
We cannot be.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.459
How did this happen?

40:07.460 --> 40:09.329
They don't have to be enemies,

40:09.330 --> 40:11.169
but that doesn't mean
they are friends.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.880
Or lovers.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.749
We cannot do this job that way.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.249
We are warriors.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.460
We once were warriors.

40:23.710 --> 40:25.040
Who are we now?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.580
Who are you?

40:29.305 --> 40:35.575
