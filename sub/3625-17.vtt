[Gossip Girl]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.657
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.442
You're one of my oldest friends.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.748
That's certainly not how it felt
when you kissed me at Eleanor's.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.795
He proposed before we left
and I'm going to say yes.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.536
[Rufus]
I'm sure you'll make
a beautiful bride.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.233
Last night was strange
but very fun.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.583
Didn't we just say goodbye?

00:18.670 --> 00:20.498
[Nate]
Somehow you screwing Blair
for sport is my fault!

00:20.585 --> 00:21.760
Alright, I know how long you
and I have been best friends.

00:21.847 --> 00:22.979
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.589
From now on,
you stay away from me.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.156
Georgina,
what are you doing here?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.592
I told you I was coming.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.942
Dan of all people
cannot know Georgie.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.554
How about, um, dinner
tonight with Sarah instead?

00:32.641 --> 00:33.816
Oh, Sarah again. What?

00:33.903 --> 00:35.209
Is she your new girlfriend
or something?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.732
She's new in town
and she does wanna meet you.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.473
I'm Sarah.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.778
What do you want from me?

00:39.865 --> 00:41.650
I want things to go back
to how they were.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.131
Before that night,
before things got so screwed up.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.523
What's Georgina got on you?

00:45.610 --> 00:48.091
What's so bad
you can't even tell me?

00:48.178 --> 00:50.615
[Georgina on tape]
If you put the camera over
there, she'll never know.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.965
- You can tell me anything.
- I killed someone.

00:57.622 --> 01:01.713
[Gossip Girl]
Where has she been, Serena?
And who am I?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.193
You know you love me.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.978
XOXO. Gossip Girl.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.592
[Gossip Girl]
In our modern age,
when you call someone

01:10.679 --> 01:13.290
and can't find them,
you can pretty much be sure

01:13.377 --> 01:15.510
they'll get the message.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.773
Hey, S, it's Georgie.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.036
Listen, I know it's early
but I thought I'd..

01:20.123 --> 01:22.995
So this is my third call.
Where are you?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.432
It's me again.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.911
I've left you a couple messages

01:25.998 --> 01:27.565
and you haven't called me back.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.133
I think we should hang out
today. Friends hang out.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.222
Maybe you've lost
your cell phone.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.659
Can't wait to see you.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.574
But if they don't call you back

01:36.661 --> 01:39.011
it usually means
they don't wanna be found.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.020
[guitar music]

01:49.718 --> 01:51.023
Hey, do you think
"Track Me Down" should come

01:51.111 --> 01:53.374
before or after "Every Time?"

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
Is the "Rolling Stone" thing
tonight?

01:54.984 --> 01:56.725
I guess I really am
in one of the top ten

01:56.812 --> 01:57.769
forgotten bands of the 90s.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.858
It's true. I forgot.

01:59.945 --> 02:00.990
Yeah, but a lot of people
remember.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.470
There's a reason that issue

02:02.557 --> 02:04.167
was one of the highest
selling of the year.

02:04.254 --> 02:06.300
Then I'm proud, dad.
I really am.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.736
You got the follow-up article
and a concert

02:07.823 --> 02:10.042
surely followed by,
uh, an overpriced CD

02:10.130 --> 02:11.653
sold at corporate coffeehouses
for Gen Xers

02:11.740 --> 02:13.742
without taste buds or taste.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.309
Hey, it's gonna be cool.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.962
I mean, they're even
filming it for VH1.

02:17.049 --> 02:20.488
VH1 Classics. The classic
is kind of important.

02:20.575 --> 02:22.881
I'm classic.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.622
'Uh-oh, no retort.'

02:24.709 --> 02:26.581
Signs of a sleepless night.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.713
Disinterest in making
your father feel

02:28.800 --> 02:30.498
old and irrelevant.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.456
That can only mean one thing.
Girl trouble.

02:32.543 --> 02:35.024
Yeah, Serena and I,
we had a fight last night.

02:35.111 --> 02:38.027
This new kind
that we keep having where..

02:38.114 --> 02:39.942
...she says something, and I
know it's not the whole truth.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.205
Well, have you asked her
what's really on her mind?

02:42.292 --> 02:43.772
Only about10,000 times, yeah.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.121
Yeah, but did you
really mean it?

02:45.208 --> 02:46.862
Most times when people
don't offer the truth

02:46.949 --> 02:48.864
it's because they're afraid
of what someone might think.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.257
And I don't know
if you know this

02:50.344 --> 02:52.128
but you can be a pretty
judgmental guy.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.956
So you're saying that I should
learn to be someone else

02:54.043 --> 02:55.740
around her, so she can
be herself around me?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.742
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.442
Thank you, dad.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.052
I'm gonna go
find her right now.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.010
See you tonight..

03:05.097 --> 03:06.621
...both of you.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.104
[instrumental music]

03:15.586 --> 03:17.675
And here I thought I had
your schedule memorized.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.199
I switched shifts
and just got off.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.070
I'm Dan's dad's roadie
for the day

03:21.157 --> 03:22.811
so I gotta bail in, like, five.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.380
Um, although, I don't mind
the stalking..

03:26.467 --> 03:27.729
...when are you gonna
ask me on a real date?

03:27.816 --> 03:29.644
[cell phone ringing]

03:29.731 --> 03:32.560
Uh, hold that thought. Sorry.

03:32.647 --> 03:33.865
Hello?

03:36.868 --> 03:38.653
Yeah.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.655
Yeah, I'll be right there.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.267
Look, I'm sorry.
I-I gotta go.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.660
- So I heard.
- No, no, no.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.096
It's not what you think.
It's just..

03:47.183 --> 03:48.228
What are you doing tonight?

03:48.315 --> 03:50.055
[laughs]

03:50.142 --> 03:52.362
Uh, me, Lincoln Hawk

03:52.449 --> 03:54.756
a dirty van
and a lot of cables?

03:54.843 --> 03:57.280
- Can I meet you at the concert?
- Can you be there at 7:30?

03:57.367 --> 03:59.326
- It's a date.
- Finally.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.414
Text me the address.

04:02.677 --> 04:03.982
[male #1]
'The guests will be checked
into their suites'

04:04.069 --> 04:05.636
as soon as they arrive.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.378
The walk-through is at 2 o'clock
and the rehearsal dinner

04:08.465 --> 04:11.599
starts promptly at 7:00 p.m.
in the Reid Salon.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.122
Oh, and don't forget,
you have your interview

04:13.209 --> 04:14.515
with "Rolling Stone"
in one hour.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.473
The interview.
How could we forget?

04:18.127 --> 04:19.868
Hey, uh, excuse me, Mr. Bass,
Miss Van Der Woodsen.

04:19.955 --> 04:21.652
Not for long,
thank you very much.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.045
- Morning, Daniel.
- Morning.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.394
Good morning. Have either
of you seen Serena?

04:24.481 --> 04:26.091
- She's not upstairs.
- 'Uh-huh.'

04:26.178 --> 04:28.224
Ticktock ticktock
ticktock ticktock ticktock.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.965
[Lily]
'No. Dan, sorry.'

04:31.227 --> 04:32.707
Okay.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.491
And her bed
hasn't been slept in.

04:34.578 --> 04:35.840
[Chuck]
'Well, I knew
housekeeping was hiring'

04:35.927 --> 04:38.278
but I had no idea
their standards were so low.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.802
[chuckles]
I hate that
I have to ask you this

04:40.889 --> 04:41.933
but have you seen Serena?

04:42.020 --> 04:42.978
Oh, I've seen lots of Serena.

04:43.065 --> 04:44.762
[cell phone ringing]

04:48.244 --> 04:49.985
Are you drunk dialing again?

04:51.682 --> 04:54.729
No, Serena didn't come
home last night.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.426
'I thought she was with you.'

04:58.559 --> 05:00.952
[instrumental music]

05:22.278 --> 05:23.453
Hey.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.154
[music continues]

05:44.474 --> 05:48.304
Maybe this is Blair's idea
of a perverse double date.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.262
Miss Blair asks that
you should wait here.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.613
- She's on her way now.
- She's not even here?

05:52.700 --> 05:53.831
[scoffs]

05:56.094 --> 05:57.357
[sighs]

05:59.141 --> 06:01.143
Well, this ought to be good.

06:01.230 --> 06:04.320
You're not calling me back
and you're not picking up.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.017
I thought you understood me

06:06.104 --> 06:08.498
but maybe I should make myself
a little more clear

06:08.585 --> 06:11.632
and come to you. We can talk
about it over coffee.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.286
I brought it just the way
you like it.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.245
Dark but sweet.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.074
Oh, no.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.990
Hey, Sarah!

06:22.077 --> 06:24.035
[laughing]
Dan!

06:24.122 --> 06:26.037
- Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

06:26.124 --> 06:27.648
- What a coincidence.
- Yeah.

06:27.735 --> 06:28.779
What-what are you doing here?

06:28.866 --> 06:30.433
Oh, um, I actually have

06:30.520 --> 06:32.304
an old friend from Portland
staying here.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.089
- Okay.
- What are you doing here?

06:34.176 --> 06:35.830
Oh, I just, I came
looking for Serena

06:35.917 --> 06:37.745
but she, uh, apparently
didn't come home last night

06:37.832 --> 06:39.399
so I'm-I'm just, I don't know

06:39.486 --> 06:40.487
trying to figure out
what to think.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.010
She's been, well, let's just say

06:42.097 --> 06:43.664
she's not been herself lately,
so I don't know.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.796
I don't know. I don't know
what to do exactly.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.885
Why don't you try
giving her a call again?

06:47.972 --> 06:50.410
And when she sees
it's you calling

06:50.497 --> 06:52.890
she'll immediately pick up
and tell you all about it.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.196
[cell phone ringing]

06:56.546 --> 06:58.113
Hey.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.506
Hey, I was lookin'
all over for you.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.551
[man on phone]
'Hey, is this Dan?'

07:01.638 --> 07:02.857
- Who's this?
- 'My name's Drew.'

07:02.944 --> 07:04.336
'I'm the bartender
at One Oak.'

07:04.424 --> 07:05.816
'Some girl left her phone here
last night.'

07:05.903 --> 07:07.383
'It's been ringing
off the hook all morning.'

07:07.470 --> 07:08.906
'You were the first number
on the speed dial.'

07:08.993 --> 07:10.386
Some girl?
What, what, what girl?

07:10.473 --> 07:11.822
[Drew]
'Tall, blonde.'

07:11.909 --> 07:13.520
'Left here around 2:00
with three guys.'

07:13.607 --> 07:16.131
'Skipped out on her tab,
which was pretty substan..'

07:16.218 --> 07:19.264
Hey, what is it?

07:19.351 --> 07:22.311
[Gossip Girl]
Spotted, lonely boy
on the Upper East Side

07:22.398 --> 07:25.488
learning the lesson that
nothing stays missing for long.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.535
It's nothing. Nothing.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.581
Things always turn up
for better..

07:31.668 --> 07:32.974
Well, is something
actually wrong

07:33.061 --> 07:34.845
or is this just some ploy
to get us both here?

07:34.932 --> 07:38.109
I meant what I said
on the phone. I need your help.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.589
We need your help.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.118
...or for worse.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.601
[Chuck]
'Oh, my God.'

07:53.168 --> 07:55.213
You okay?

07:55.300 --> 07:58.260
- What's wrong with her?
- Take her upstairs.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.480
Dorota! Coffee, fast.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.316
- Come on, Serena.
- No, I just want--

08:11.403 --> 08:12.709
We have to get her
in the shower.

08:12.796 --> 08:13.928
We have to keep her
talking and awake.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.016
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.931
Dorota, will you please get her

08:17.018 --> 08:18.498
a fresh change of clothes
and a bathrobe?

08:18.585 --> 08:20.282
Of course, Miss Blair.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.676
So we have every hangover cure

08:22.763 --> 08:25.330
known to man, plus bagels.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.680
'They should help
soak up the alcohol'

08:26.767 --> 08:28.159
and whatever else she took.

08:28.246 --> 08:31.380
Thank you. I'll take it
from here. Come on.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.864
Come on, come on, Serena.
Help me out.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.780
[Serena]
'B, it's cold! It's cold!'

08:39.867 --> 08:42.130
- Just like old times.
- You know..

08:42.217 --> 08:44.915
Why do I get the feeling
you're actually enjoying this?

08:45.002 --> 08:47.483
[Serena retching]

08:47.570 --> 08:49.224
Call me sentimental.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.486
[toilet flushing]

08:50.573 --> 08:52.096
[Serena coughing]

08:54.403 --> 08:56.448
Ugh! We may not need
those bagels after all.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.190
- What's going on with her?
- Uh, she was here last night.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.149
Scared. She..

09:01.236 --> 09:03.064
[sighs]
She told me something
totally crazy

09:03.151 --> 09:06.328
but was too freaked out
to find the words to explain it.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.896
I went upstairs to find
my mom's Valium to calm her down

09:08.983 --> 09:11.768
but when I got back,
she was gone.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.378
It took me all night
to find her.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.293
What exactly did she say to you?

09:17.382 --> 09:19.123
That's beside the point.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.169
We're here to help Serena,
no matter what the problem is.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.393
Mm.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.352
Hey, could you maybe
read that somewhere else?

09:35.662 --> 09:37.315
I don't like "The Post."

I don't know if
you've talked to him recently.

09:43.713 --> 09:44.888
We've talked.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.673
He and Serena,
should I be worried?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.762
It's been a little
bumpy lately, sure.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.720
I think the most recent bump
is our friend, Sarah.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.853
Serena's a little jealous,
but Sarah's cool

09:52.940 --> 09:54.158
so as soon as Serena
gets to know her

09:54.245 --> 09:56.508
everything will be fine.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.075
Okay, that's good.

Well, I would.
It's positively iconic.

other than my work.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.848
Why did you give up photography?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.502

- Have you tried calling?
