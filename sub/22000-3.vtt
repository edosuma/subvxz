WEBVTT

00:01.736 --> 00:03.769
Morning. How was your weekend?

00:04.605 --> 00:06.205
Good.
Though, it was kind of...

00:06.207 --> 00:07.406
Hot, I know.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.074
- No, I was gonna say...
- Humid?

00:09.076 --> 00:10.242
- No.
- Moist?

00:10.411 --> 00:11.577
Actually, I was gonna say...

00:11.579 --> 00:12.644
- Misty?
- No.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.079
Morning, miss Angela.

00:14.281 --> 00:16.382
Oh, great.
My dad will help you.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.418
No, Janet.
- You stay, and learn.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.588
So, what we looking for today?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.289
- I was gonna get some...
- Ice cream?

00:24.291 --> 00:26.525
- We're having a big sale.
- No, actually, I...

00:26.527 --> 00:28.627
Having party? Need two carton?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.195
- No.
- Oh. Three.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.398
- No, you keep cutting me...
- Good deal.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.733
Four carton
for price of three.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.069
Well, that is a pretty
good price.

00:37.071 --> 00:41.340
(chuckles)
with lotto ticket, is $23.95.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.308
Oh!

00:43.310 --> 00:45.377
(customer laughs)

00:45.378 --> 00:47.445
Okay, see you.
Have a fun party. (chuckles)

00:47.448 --> 00:49.548
(doorbell jingles)

00:49.550 --> 00:52.885
- Janet: That was...
- Genius? Magical? Amazing?

00:52.887 --> 00:54.119
Okay, now,
you're acting like a...

00:54.121 --> 00:55.320
King? Hero?

00:55.890 --> 00:58.290
You can't beat me,
Janet, because I am...

00:58.292 --> 01:00.159
Annoying? Frustrating?

01:00.161 --> 01:03.462
- Good. Now, you starting to...
- Learn?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.431
Get the hang of it?
Beat you at your own game?

01:05.433 --> 01:06.665
- Okay.
- See you.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.271
(theme music playing)

01:30.124 --> 01:31.423
Pastor Nina: Oh, well,
my landlady said

01:31.425 --> 01:32.691
It would only be a week.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.793
That's the reason I agreed
to the renovation.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.129
And guess how long it's been?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.730
A month? Two months?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.766
Ten days.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.333
But that's a long time
with no hot water,

01:42.336 --> 01:44.136
And noise and dust.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.304
You stay here.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.805
Janet is move out.
You take room.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.308
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't want to intrude.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.310
What you talking?
We is a family.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.778
Spiritual family.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.880
I'd insist on paying for it.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.382
What the heck you talking?
It's free.

01:57.384 --> 02:00.385
And beside, it will be nice
to have full house

02:00.387 --> 02:03.522
After Janet is move out
so long time ago.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.756
Oh, how long has it been?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.792
Two weeks.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.827
But that's a long time
with just Mr. Kim.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.630
- Okay.
- Oh!

02:11.632 --> 02:13.799
Thank you, Mrs. Kim,
this is very generous.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.900
You're very welcome.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.402
- Hmm! Pastor Nina!
- Mr. Kim.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.805
Well, I guess
I'll see you both later.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.273
Thank you, again, Mrs. Kim.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.208
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.480
- Why is she seeing us later?
- Pastor Nina is coming over.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.548
Appa: Hmm.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.184
- Maybe she stay for dinner.
- Okay.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.353
Maybe she stay overnight?

02:34.355 --> 02:36.321
(sighs) why?

02:36.457 --> 02:38.323
Her apartment is renovation.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.292
So, we running hotel now?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.895
We is good christian.
She need a place to stay.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.464
Well, then,
as a good christian,

02:45.466 --> 02:47.933
You better hide
your secret cigarette.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.569
Well, you better hide
your secret whiskey,

02:50.571 --> 02:53.539
Poker chip, cigar
and bathroom magazine.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.775
I only read for article.
(scoffs)

02:59.880 --> 03:01.413
Jung: Kimch, what
are we doing tonight?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.814
I'm seeing a movie
with my cuz.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.349
I would have invited you,
but I know you hate

03:04.351 --> 03:05.417
The movies we see.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.885
That's not true.
What are you seeing?

03:06.887 --> 03:08.854
Documentary about street cats.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.389
- Jung: Do they talk?
- Who?

03:10.391 --> 03:11.957
- The cats.
- No.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.192
I'm out.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.860
(chuckles) you were never in.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.963
(door opens)

03:17.965 --> 03:20.199
- (door closes)
- (dial tone rings)

03:20.201 --> 03:21.700
(cellphone ringing)

03:21.702 --> 03:22.868
Everything okay?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.553
Can't a guy just be interested

03:24.554 --> 03:26.237
In what his sister's doing
on a Friday night?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.940
Janet:
<i>No, really, what's wrong?</i>

03:27.942 --> 03:29.808
Nothing. What's happening?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.843
- Trivia night.
- Jung: <i>Sounds lame.</i>

03:31.845 --> 03:32.945
You need me to bring anything?

03:33.280 --> 03:34.746
- Bring it where?
<i>- I'll grab some beer.</i>

03:34.949 --> 03:36.648
- Your friends will thank me.
<i>- No, wait...</i>

03:38.319 --> 03:39.751
- That's weird.
- He probably just hung up.

03:40.955 --> 03:43.288
No, I think my brother's
coming tonight.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.890
Here?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.327
Could be good, though.
My brother's...

03:50.264 --> 03:51.263
Athletic?

03:54.568 --> 03:58.537
Umma, look who I find
in store, trying to steal.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.656
Ha! Mr. Kim.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.774
Pastor Nina, perfect timing.
We just getting ready to eat.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.543
I hope this isn't all
for me, though.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.812
Oh, no. It's for three of us.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.381
It's nothing,
just everyday style.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.716
Please, sit down. We eat.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.351
Pastor Nina very hungry.

04:12.353 --> 04:16.888
(laughs) I'm okay, actually.
But okay, sure.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.525
Oh...

04:20.527 --> 04:22.261
Uh, appa?

04:22.763 --> 04:23.829
(whispers) pray.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.464
Oh. (chuckles)

04:27.534 --> 04:28.600
Oh.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.035
Oh, we're standing?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.336
Uh...

04:32.506 --> 04:34.573
Yeah. Okay.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.041
Yeah, this is good.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.309
(chuckling)

04:40.614 --> 04:41.680
Oh!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.548
- Dear...
- Amen. Okay.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.418
- Hope you not vegetarian.
- No, I'm not.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.688
It's, uh, Korean food.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.724
But I make less spicy than
usual in case you don't like.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.726
No, no, I like a little spice,

04:54.728 --> 04:57.496
But this is all too much,
Mrs. Kim. I feel bad.

04:57.498 --> 05:01.266
Yeah, she's not the queen
of England, just a pastor.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.334
Appa.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.402
I'm actually
going out tonight.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.905
You have a hot date?

05:06.907 --> 05:07.939
(chuckles)

05:07.941 --> 05:09.708
- Pastor Nina: Oh.
- Appa.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.777
Just joking. (chuckles)

05:12.313 --> 05:13.545
- Or maybe not?
- (pastor Nina laughs)

05:13.547 --> 05:14.613
(chokes)

05:21.989 --> 05:23.755
So, I give the guy
his $20 back,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.557
And he just looks
at me and says,

05:25.559 --> 05:26.892
"you're freaking awesome!"

05:27.361 --> 05:29.594
And then he just walks away.
You can't beat that.

05:29.596 --> 05:30.962
You're so funny.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.765
It was also the same day
that I got this.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.535
Hurt like a bitch, but...

05:36.704 --> 05:38.070
Uh, wow. (chuckles)

05:39.873 --> 05:40.972
Jung: Thanks, bud.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.741
- Actually...
- Cheers.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.376
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.913
Okay, we're ready.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.380
Uh, everyone got everything?
Drinks, snacks, shirts?

05:49.383 --> 05:51.016
Good.
Jung, why don't you start?

05:51.518 --> 05:53.452
All right,
let's take this for a spin.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.021
History it is.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.389
This beer will be history
in a minute.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.690
(Jen laughs)

05:59.526 --> 06:01.460
In 1951,
what British prime minister...

06:01.462 --> 06:03.462
(imitates buzzer)
trick question.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.596
Britain doesn't have
a prime minister.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.465
It has a queen.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.333
And the new one's super hot.
Uh, Kate something?

06:08.335 --> 06:09.735
(laughter)

06:09.737 --> 06:11.870
You're thinking of
the duchess of Cambridge.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.873
Right. Duchess of Cambridge.
Final answer.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.875
(Jen laughs)

06:16.877 --> 06:17.943
(slurps)

06:21.448 --> 06:24.082
- (whispers) appa?
- What's problem?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.585
- Where's pastor Nina?
- Washroom.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.123
Look what I find upstair.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.391
Hmm?

06:32.393 --> 06:33.825
Why you take
Pastor Nina's thing?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.560
It's not her thing.
It's Janet thing.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.929
And it's good thing I find
before pastor Nina find.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.998
What you talking?
Why Janet have that thing?

06:40.401 --> 06:42.601
Go put back
in pastor Nina purse
before she coming out.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.769
I find under bed!

06:44.705 --> 06:45.971
This is Janet's thing.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.472
Pastor Nina is a pastor,

06:47.474 --> 06:48.740
She's not married.
What you talking?

06:48.742 --> 06:49.808
- (flushes)
- (gasps)

06:49.810 --> 06:51.109
Hurry, go,
put back exactly.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.645
- What if you wrong?
- What if you wrong? Hurry! Go!

06:53.647 --> 06:54.679
(grunts)

06:54.681 --> 06:55.747
(clears throat)

06:57.751 --> 06:58.817
Pastor Nina...

06:58.819 --> 06:59.885
(chuckles)

07:00.387 --> 07:02.487
Oh! Uh...

07:03.590 --> 07:06.458
I need to ask
special question.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.693
Okay, what is it?

07:08.695 --> 07:12.063
I was just thinking
about bible

07:12.065 --> 07:14.966
And the Jesus
and lots of thing.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.002
And I was thinking...

07:18.806 --> 07:20.672
Is dinosaur in bible?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.607
Oh. Uh...

07:22.609 --> 07:24.142
Well, believe it or not,
there are

07:24.144 --> 07:28.013
A few possible references to
dinosaurs in the bible. Yes.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.781
It depends
- on the translation.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.016
Okay, thank you.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.951
Because translators,
if you think about it,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.020
Are only products
of their time and culture.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.023
For example, a major
shortcoming of the Septuagint,

07:38.025 --> 07:40.058
The Greek translation
of the Hebrew bible,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.794
Was their complete lack
of attention to synonyms.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.996
So, words like "mercy"
and "compassion"

07:44.998 --> 07:47.766
And "love"
- were often confused.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.504
Who was the first
defense man to win

07:52.506 --> 07:53.972
The NHL point-scoring title?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.007
- Oh, my god, so easy.
- Jung.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.610
NHL, it's Wayne Gretzky?

07:58.612 --> 08:00.479
- Bobby Orr.
- Bobby Orr.

08:00.481 --> 08:01.546
Bobby Orr.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.015
- Why couldn't I get that one?
- Your spin.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.985
Semira: Geography.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.621
Where is Hershey chocolate
produced?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.524
- In a factory.
- No, like, where.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.193
Oh, right... Uh, America.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.498
- Can you be more specific?
- The united states of America.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.801
It's kind of a trick question.
Kind of.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.138
The answer is in the question.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.574
Oh, like <i>jeopardy!</i>
Where is chocolate village?

08:31.011 --> 08:31.944
No.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.878
What is jersey milk?
Where is new jersey?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.179
- Pennsylvania.
- Really?

08:34.181 --> 08:35.247
I thought it was
its own state.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.915
No, Hershey...

08:36.917 --> 08:38.550
Pennsylvania.
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

08:38.552 --> 08:41.219
- Janet: There it is.
- (grunts) Jung's on the board!

08:41.221 --> 08:42.888
Oh, it was kind
of a group effort.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.190
Was that a two-spot question,
or one spot?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.225
All the questions
are one spot questions.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.727
Let him have the spots.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.961
Good job, Jung.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.966
Okay. I'm going out now.
Please don't wait up.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.568
- Okay, night-night.
- Good night.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.073
(door opens and closes)

09:10.484 --> 09:11.683
Ah-ha!

09:11.685 --> 09:14.486
They still here,
so, they is Janet thing.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.587
- We take.
- No "ah-ha."

09:16.523 --> 09:17.822
One is missing,
so, it's a pastor Nina thing.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.558
- We leave.
- -One is not missing.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.726
Yeah, used be seven,
now, is six.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.129
Pastor Nina take one,
using for tonight.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.665
Why would pastor Nina
bring over to our house,

09:26.667 --> 09:29.568
Then hide under Janet's bed?
That doesn't make sense.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.270
Why would Janet move out,
come back,

09:32.272 --> 09:34.105
Hide under bed, do laundry,

09:34.107 --> 09:37.175
"hi, appa. Hi, umma,"
then go back to apartment

09:37.177 --> 09:38.276
And not take?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.312
That doesn't even
more make sense!

09:40.314 --> 09:43.281
You is in denial.
Janet is adult.

09:44.618 --> 09:48.086
Pastor Nina is modern woman.
She wear sneaker with skirt.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.756
She have a blog. You don't
think she can't have condom?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.692
What is glide technology?

09:54.728 --> 09:55.794
Hmm?

09:56.597 --> 09:59.631
Ask pastor Nina. She know.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.172
You think pastor Nina
is still sleeping?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.941
Maybe she tired from vigorous
nighttime activity.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.676
Or maybe,
she find Janet's thing,

10:11.678 --> 10:12.978
And already, she's packing.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.146
- Is not Janet's thing.
- Pastor Nina: Morning.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.048
Umma: Oh, good morning,
pastor Nina.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.149
How did you sleep?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.151
Oh, like a log. I was spent.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.221
Oh! So, you have fun time.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.057
Oh, we have fun time, too.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.927
Counting blessings,
reading bible.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.662
This looks so good.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.198
I might have to help myself
to extra bacon this morning.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.201
- How fun is that?
- So fun. (chuckles)

10:36.203 --> 10:40.205
But be careful, sometimes,
two bacon stick together,

10:40.207 --> 10:42.207
Two flesh become one.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.676
Right, pastor Nina?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.444
- Not right.
- Oh, no, he is right.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.681
- Uh, mark 10:8.
- Yeah.

10:49.683 --> 10:53.151
It is good to have
such a big appetite

10:53.153 --> 10:54.352
After such a busy night.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.756
With a close friend?
A special someone?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.826
It was my friend, Steve.
We met at seminary years ago.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.362
Oh. So, good christian friend?

11:04.364 --> 11:07.332
So, you know him in bible way?

11:07.334 --> 11:09.901
Well, I used to work
with his wife actually.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.369
Oh. So, he is married?

11:11.371 --> 11:16.107
Well, uh, no. Ex-wife.
She and I used
to be good friends.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.976
But not anymore?

11:17.978 --> 11:20.345
No, unfortunately,
she was having an affair

11:20.347 --> 11:22.047
With my now ex-husband.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.151
Okay, maybe,
we stop asking question now.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.686
No, no, it's okay.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.855
Steve and I have remained
close friends.

11:30.857 --> 11:35.093
It's our faith that has kept
us deeply connected.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.430
He has an enormous spirit.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.299
Mmm-hmm.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.837
Well, I am going to take this
upstairs, if you don't mind.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.173
Okay, if you want a shower...

11:48.175 --> 11:51.076
No, no, no. I showered
when I got home last night.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.177
I felt so dirty.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.747
I am not going to lie to you.
It had been a while.

11:55.749 --> 11:56.815
Appa: Hmm?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.284
Since I showered
with hot water.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.418
Because of the renovation?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.420
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.789
Of course, renovation. Okay.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.825
- Have good day.
- Thank you.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.966
She not take any bacon.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.135
Maybe she is saving fun
for Steve.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.336
Ah!

12:23.510 --> 12:25.410
Kimchee:
So, this cat, he's smaller,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.479
But had way more heart
than the others.

12:28.115 --> 12:31.382
And he just...
He just couldn't...

12:31.384 --> 12:33.084
He couldn't find anyone
to love him.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.420
- Sounds pretty boring.
- Stupid cats.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.822
Why do they even
make movies like that?

12:38.959 --> 12:42.927
All right. I'm heading out.
Call me about wing night.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.896
Sure. I love wings.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.003
(door opens)

12:52.572 --> 12:53.838
(door closes)

12:54.107 --> 12:55.840
Looks like somebody
had a good night.

12:55.842 --> 12:56.908
Yeah, it was okay.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.446
Hey, listen.
Do you think I'm dumb?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.314
What did she do
to you in there?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.449
No, seriously.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.351
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- No.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.153
Okay. Good.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.791
I mean, like,
you're not dumb, dumb, but...

13:12.793 --> 13:13.958
But what?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.760
You're smart.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.561
You're street smart, you're
girl smart, you eat smart...

13:17.564 --> 13:19.964
You're just not,
you know, book smart.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.399
- What does that even mean?
- Book smart.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.434
Like, you read a lot
and learn stuff from books.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.970
I know what it means.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.505
Okay, well, you never finished
high school, or a book.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.242
I've finished books.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.944
I just wouldn't say
you're very well read.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.380
I may not read a lot of books,
but I'm well read.

13:38.952 --> 13:39.534
Okay.

13:39.535 --> 13:40.117
I read that
<i>men's health</i> magazine

13:40.120 --> 13:41.486
Every time I use the bathroom.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.938
Exactly.

13:42.939 --> 13:44.389
Did you know that a weak core
is what keeps most guys

13:44.391 --> 13:46.257
From lifting more weight
in a dead lift?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.325
Did not know that.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.060
(Jung sighs)

13:54.367 --> 13:59.437
Then under bed, we find
lots of package of condom.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.140
Holy shit, Mr. Kim!

14:02.142 --> 14:03.842
Stop yelling.
What's your problem?

14:04.077 --> 14:06.578
The mind boggles
at the implications.

14:07.914 --> 14:10.415
Either your daughter
is doing the nasty,

14:10.417 --> 14:12.283
Or your pastor
is doing the nasty.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.419
Either way,
the nasty is getting done.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.387
My daughter is not nasty.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.357
How can you be sure?
Janet's how old?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.425
Only 20.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.127
That's almost three
in dog years.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.397
When ginger was two,
she was an innocent puppy.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.900
But when she turn three,
I take her to the dog park

14:28.902 --> 14:31.369
And bing bong,
she open for business.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.004
German shepherd, chihuahua...

14:33.006 --> 14:36.274
Janet is not dog.
She is my daughter.

14:36.276 --> 14:39.310
And you'll drive yourself
crazy worrying about her.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.279
I got a dog walker.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.547
Now, ginger can
do what she wants,

14:42.549 --> 14:44.766
With whoever she wants,

14:44.767 --> 14:46.984
It's none of my business.
Best money I ever spent.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.419
Hi, appa. Hey, Mr. Chin.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.255
Oh, hi, Janet.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.589
I'm just here
to pick up a few things
from my room.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.992
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.663
By the way,
what I told you about ginger

14:58.665 --> 15:00.465
Was said in confidence.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.902
What happens in the dog park,
stays in the dog park.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.410
Oh, pretty thick book
you got there.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.280
Hey, how long
does it usually take you

15:15.282 --> 15:16.547
To finish something like that?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.951
I don't know, like a day
or two. I just started.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.287
- It's a cool story.
- You read it?

15:22.289 --> 15:24.522
Oh, yeah, yeah, a while ago.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.992
Food, religion,
good soundtrack.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.962
To the movie. Which I saw
after I read the book.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.933
That book literally
changed my life.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.467
After my ex read it,
he broke up with me

15:36.469 --> 15:37.936
And moved to India.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.371
And coincidentally,
it's based on a true story.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.073
Oh, why coincidentally?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.175
Because she actually
did those things.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.277
What's the coincidence?

15:48.982 --> 15:50.481
Have you seen
Elizabeth Gilbert's ted talk?

15:50.483 --> 15:51.649
Yeah,
that's why I'm reading it.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.185
- So good.
- Who's Elizabeth Gilbert?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.421
(both laughing)

15:56.423 --> 15:58.323
Wha...

15:58.325 --> 16:01.225
The author. Coincidentally.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.293
(chuckles)

16:03.196 --> 16:05.496
Oh, the author of this book.
Elizabeth Gilbert.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.465
Yeah, yeah. She's amazing.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.335
And Julia Roberts
plays her really, really well.

16:10.337 --> 16:13.404
In the movie.
Which I saw after.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.606
Here's another fun fact.

16:15.608 --> 16:19.210
Hershey chocolate is made
in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.551
- Janet: Hi.
- Hi.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.219
I just came
to grab a few things.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.588
Of course, it's your room.
I can leave if you want.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.990
Oh, no, it's fine.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.293
Speaking of grabbing
a few things,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.228
I thought you might want
to take these.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.130
Oh.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.666
Is this a talk?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.267
I assumed they're yours.
I found them under the bed.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.571
Oh, my god. Sorry. Right.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.206
(chuckles)

16:48.208 --> 16:50.274
They're just always giving
them away at school,

16:50.276 --> 16:53.011
And I'm like, "stop giving me
condoms already."

16:53.013 --> 16:54.445
Not that I don't like them.

16:54.447 --> 16:58.282
Just because...
Well, for a lot of reasons...

16:58.284 --> 17:00.118
I totally get it.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.988
- I'm on the pill. To regulate.
- Great.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.157
And I know it does
not protect against STIs,

17:06.159 --> 17:07.725
But what are you gonna do?

17:09.295 --> 17:11.029
Use condoms I guess.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.265
I'm just gonna keep grabbing
a few things.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.334
I'm gonna keep
folding laundry.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.475
I brought a lot of European
authors and poetry.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.278
I'm assuming this is
to impress a girl?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.180
No, I wanna actually
read them.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.649
Why?

17:31.650 --> 17:32.616
I'm thinking
about finishing high school.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.751
Getting my diploma online.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.287
Wow. That's great.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.123
Maybe it's stupid.
I'm pretty busy.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.458
No, you should do it.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.194
You know how I get
all the awards,

17:43.196 --> 17:45.163
Always make the honor roll,
dean's list...

17:45.165 --> 17:47.265
Yeah, I get it. You got
the brains, I got the looks.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.233
Yeah, I'm really smart.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.071
So, listen to me when I say
you can do this.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.175
- Thanks.
- And you didn't get the looks.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.543
Tell that to your friend,
Jane.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.412
- Jen!
- Oh! Ah...

18:01.414 --> 18:03.314
Right. Chicken wing Jen.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.051
What you doing?

18:07.053 --> 18:09.120
What does it look
like I'm doing?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.556
- Making bed?
- Good.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.559
Umma, maybe it's better
we don't know.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.360
Hmm?
- None of our business.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.296
So, you admit
it's Janet's thing?

18:18.298 --> 18:19.363
I not say that.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.731
(sighs)

18:20.733 --> 18:24.702
Just think, even if condom
is still under bed...

18:24.704 --> 18:26.571
- They're not, I check.
- Even if...

18:26.573 --> 18:28.739
And Janet was here today,
picking up some...

18:28.741 --> 18:32.343
Even if. Doesn't matter. Hmm?

18:32.345 --> 18:36.447
Important thing is,
we respect privacy.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.748
(sighs)

18:40.086 --> 18:41.653
Oh!

18:41.654 --> 18:43.221
You're in my room.
Putting away my underwear.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.724
And sock.
This one need mending.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.159
I can fix for you.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.293
It's okay.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.663
So, uh, good news.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.700
I am going to be moving back
to my place tonight.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.268
- Oh!
- They, uh, finish renovation?

18:57.270 --> 19:00.338
No. I just thought
that you could use some space.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.240
So, if you could leave those,

19:02.242 --> 19:05.710
I will just finish packing up
and be on my way.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.217
- Door is always open.
- Certainly seems to be.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.385
(gunshots in video game)

19:14.387 --> 19:16.454
Yo, after I'm done
winning world war ii,

19:16.456 --> 19:17.889
You wanna get some pho?

19:17.891 --> 19:21.259
Not now. I'm reading
about the real world war ii.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.630
This is real, too. You got
chaos, brotherhood, and...

19:25.632 --> 19:27.498
Yeah! My guy just shot a boat.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.666
(vocalizes)

19:28.668 --> 19:30.835
Did you know
that almost 700,000 Koreans

19:30.837 --> 19:33.171
Were brought into japan
and forced into labor?

19:33.173 --> 19:34.772
Did you know
if my guy upgrades to officer,

19:34.774 --> 19:36.340
My tanks move faster?

19:37.177 --> 19:39.777
Just conquered north Africa.
Let's pho it up.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.513
Nah, you go.
I gotta learn this.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.881
Oh!

19:43.883 --> 19:45.816
So, you destroy Janet
at the next trivia night.

19:45.818 --> 19:46.851
Nice.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.219
It's for my "GED."

19:48.588 --> 19:49.887
- Your what?
- My "GED."

19:49.889 --> 19:51.155
It's like
a high school diploma.

19:51.457 --> 19:52.690
You mean your GED?

19:53.326 --> 19:54.926
Yeah.
A lot of people call it "GED."

20:01.201 --> 20:02.733
Stop worry about Janet.

20:02.735 --> 20:06.837
I not worry.
Just, 20 seem so young.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.506
Janet know what she is doing.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.675
How you know she know
what she doing?

20:10.677 --> 20:13.211
Because she is a smart girl.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.713
And I have talk with her
when she was 10.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.584
- Ten?
- -Hmm. She ask where baby
come from, I tell her.

20:19.586 --> 20:23.688
So, this is you fault.
You tell her too much,
too young.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.357
No. I prepare her.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.460
Her body was changing,
hair growing...

20:29.462 --> 20:30.528
Okay, okay.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.565
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.934
How old we each
when we doing...

20:36.936 --> 20:39.303
You know, first time?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.473
When we is doing first time,

20:42.475 --> 20:45.009
I was a little bit older
than Janet.

20:45.912 --> 20:50.381
- Why you say "we" like that?
- How I say "we"?

20:50.383 --> 20:53.951
You say "we" like
when we doing first time,

20:53.953 --> 20:56.687
Isn't when you
is doing first time.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.755
Oh.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.393
When "we" is doing first time,
was you doing first time?

21:02.395 --> 21:05.997
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay. Good.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.734
- (grunts)
- okay.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.443
- Umma...
- Already sleeping.
