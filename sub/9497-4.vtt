01:35.709 --> 01:36.751
Oh.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.042
So.

03:35.292 --> 03:37.542
- This is nice.
- Huh?

03:37.626 --> 03:38.834
- This is a nice place.

03:40.334 --> 03:41.375
- Yeah, yeah.

03:42.417 --> 03:43.459
- What?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.167
- Well...

03:46.501 --> 03:47.542
Okay.

03:49.417 --> 03:50.459
- Are you okay?

03:53.876 --> 03:55.792
- Yeah, I mean, it's just that,
this is-

03:57.417 --> 03:58.459
- What's wrong?
You're upset.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.959
- Thank you.

04:09.626 --> 04:10.876
You're upset, I think.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.000
- No, I'm not.
Why?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.459
- Look, I-
You know, I didn't-

04:19.000 --> 04:21.166
If you want to go,
you can just go.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.000
- Go where?

04:26.667 --> 04:27.709
- Yeah, okay.

04:28.751 --> 04:29.792
- Hey, I mean-

04:30.167 --> 04:32.083
l'm not sure what's going on
with you.

04:32.417 --> 04:33.626
This is always weird, but...

04:35.501 --> 04:36.959
We're total strangers,
but I mean,

04:37.375 --> 04:38.834
if you would just tell me...

04:39.959 --> 04:42.876
I mean, are you disappointed
in my looks or...?

04:43.334 --> 04:44.584
- l'm not.

04:44.667 --> 04:45.918
- Because you should know,
I mean, if that's the case,

04:46.209 --> 04:47.709
that doesn't-
That doesn't hurt my feelings.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.959
- I'm not, you're the one.
- I'm the one what?

04:51.709 --> 04:52.751
- Look, I-

04:53.626 --> 04:56.042
I was pretty damn honest on my
profile, you know?

04:56.292 --> 04:59.501
I put my real age
and a current picture

04:59.959 --> 05:05.584
and a preference for women in my
age group, so I expect to meet

05:05.667 --> 05:07.876
someone who's
expecting me, okay?

05:07.959 --> 05:14.292
Because it's not exactly fun to
show up and- and see a cute

05:14.375 --> 05:16.292
young girl looking at me like,
booby prize.

05:17.209 --> 05:18.501
Do you think that's fun for me?

05:18.584 --> 05:20.000
- Whoa, wait a minute.
l'm not-

05:20.083 --> 05:22.334
- Maybe you should just be
a little bit more careful about

05:22.417 --> 05:24.876
looking at the person
that you choose.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.000
You know, I mean,
what did you expect?

05:27.083 --> 05:28.125
- I expected you.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.459
You look exactly
like your picture.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.459
You look your age, you should...

05:32.626 --> 05:33.667
look your age.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.501
- Were you gonna tell me
you look 45?

05:37.334 --> 05:38.375
- Okay, look...

05:39.083 --> 05:40.125
I'm the one, okay?

05:41.209 --> 05:42.417
I put myself as older.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.292
- Why do you do that?

05:45.459 --> 05:46.501
- Because, I don't know.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.209
Can we just look at the food?

05:48.292 --> 05:50.626
Because, l'm actually hungry.

05:51.626 --> 05:53.792
Or do you really just
want to leave now?

05:55.834 --> 05:57.959
- Yeah, let's look at the food.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.292
- What are you getting?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.459
- Why do you put
yourself as older?

06:09.751 --> 06:11.375
I mean-
I mean, who does that?

06:11.459 --> 06:12.709
Nobody does that.

06:12.792 --> 06:13.792
- Okay.
- l'm sorry, I-

06:13.876 --> 06:15.334
I mean, I don't get it.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.459
- Well, we can talk
about this, but...

06:19.792 --> 06:21.000
I don't really know you.

06:22.375 --> 06:24.417
And you're not really letting
the conversation get started,

06:24.542 --> 06:26.542
so how do we get-
- You sort of put us behind

06:26.626 --> 06:30.209
the eight-ball by lying about
your age from jump.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.375
I mean, how old are you, really?

06:36.125 --> 06:37.626
I mean, maybe we
should just go.

06:37.709 --> 06:38.751
- I'm 26.

06:40.375 --> 06:41.417
- Okay, well...

06:42.876 --> 06:43.918
That's young.

06:44.501 --> 06:47.334
I mean, l'm old enough to be
your ancestor.

06:47.501 --> 06:48.542
- Not really.

06:49.334 --> 06:50.876
- Come on, when I was
in high school,

06:50.959 --> 06:53.209
your parents were in
junior high school.

06:53.459 --> 06:54.709
- My dad is older than you.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.709
It's not as bad
as you're making it.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.876
- Well, so why- why then-

06:58.959 --> 07:00.000
- I like older guys.

07:01.667 --> 07:02.709
- Okay, but see...

07:04.167 --> 07:06.000
I didn't, you know...

07:06.918 --> 07:08.834
Put that I want
younger woman, all right?

07:10.459 --> 07:12.751
I mean, I know some guys
do that, but I didn't.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.667
You know, I mean,
I'm not like that.

07:14.751 --> 07:16.000
- I know.

07:16.083 --> 07:17.542
I don't like guys that are.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.667
See, I like older guys,

07:20.751 --> 07:23.167
but I don't like older guys that
like younger women.

07:23.584 --> 07:25.250
Those kinds of guys are a drag.

07:25.918 --> 07:26.959
I like...

07:27.709 --> 07:28.751
I don't know.

07:31.626 --> 07:32.667
- Okay, well...

07:33.876 --> 07:35.334
What do you want to do?

07:36.626 --> 07:38.083
- Well, we could just go now.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.834
Since it's all weird.

07:41.959 --> 07:44.584
Or we could have
dinner and talk.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.626
waiter: Hi. Can I get you guys
a drink to start?

07:48.501 --> 07:50.209
- Um...
- I'm okay with water.

07:51.209 --> 07:52.417
- I'll have a white wine.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.083
Do you have anything
that's okay?

07:54.167 --> 07:55.626
waiter: I have a pinot grigio.

07:55.834 --> 07:56.876
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

08:05.626 --> 08:06.667
- So...

08:07.542 --> 08:09.209
What do you want to talk about?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.042
- Um...

08:12.792 --> 08:13.834
What do you do?

08:16.042 --> 08:17.250
- I work at a bar.

08:17.542 --> 08:18.584
- Oh, cool.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.584
- Why?
Why- Why is that cool?

08:24.584 --> 08:27.042
- Because-
I don't know.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.918
'Cause you won't really talk,
because you're mad

08:31.125 --> 08:32.375
and being weird,

08:32.458 --> 08:33.833
and so I just said "cool"

08:34.542 --> 08:38.417
because you're doing nothing
to make me comfortable.

08:38.542 --> 08:39.583
- Sorry.
l'm sorry.

08:40.125 --> 08:43.125
It's just "what do you do"
doesn't exactly raise my stock

08:43.208 --> 08:45.501
any further, all right?

08:45.584 --> 08:50.167
I mean, I work in a bar,
it's my family's bar.

08:50.334 --> 08:52.083
And...

08:52.250 --> 08:54.667
I- I keep the place clean
and in ship shape,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.417
and I live in
a small room in the back.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.459
It's not exactly impressive.

09:00.417 --> 09:01.459
- Well... so?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.667
l'm a temp and a barista
and I have a stupid blog

09:04.751 --> 09:06.667
about books I stopped writing
two years ago.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.542
No one's impressive anymore.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.417
You're really just
gonna have water?

09:17.751 --> 09:18.792
- Well, I don't drink.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.626
- Mm.

09:20.709 --> 09:21.751
That's actually
pretty refreshing.

09:22.417 --> 09:23.626
Almost everyone I know drinks.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.292
It's boring, you know?

09:25.584 --> 09:27.042
Well, most people
my age, anyway.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.751
l'm so sick of boys my age.

09:30.584 --> 09:31.626
- Yeah, you said that.

09:33.959 --> 09:35.876
So, I mean,
you like older guys, huh?

09:36.375 --> 09:39.042
Does that, like, float your boat
or whatever?

09:39.626 --> 09:42.042
- If you ever tried dating boys
my age, you'd understand.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.834
You don't even realize,
you're a person.

09:47.792 --> 09:51.334
You held the door open for me,
you slid out my chair.

09:52.042 --> 09:53.083
You dressed up.

09:54.292 --> 09:56.918
Boys just show up all smelly
and look at the floor.

09:58.667 --> 10:03.042
You seem like you were
well-raised, like someone taught

10:03.125 --> 10:04.167
you manners and chivalry.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.167
- I mean, not really.

10:08.959 --> 10:10.667
I used to watch
a lot of old movies.

10:10.751 --> 10:11.792
Um...

10:12.459 --> 10:13.501
Guys like Cary Grant.

10:15.375 --> 10:19.626
I don't know, you don't need
somebody to tell you to treat

10:19.709 --> 10:20.959
a lady with respect,

10:21.042 --> 10:22.959
it's something that you're
just compelled to do.

10:24.501 --> 10:27.250
You know, I mean, because women
are special.

10:28.125 --> 10:32.209
And I don't mean like that,
like, uh, you're lesser than men

10:32.292 --> 10:33.334
or anything, or different.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.250
In fact, I feel that women
and men are equals.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.083
- I don't.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.792
- You don't?
- No.

10:41.876 --> 10:44.292
I mean, depending on how you're
measuring, in some ways,

10:44.417 --> 10:46.083
we're better than men,
or above men,

10:46.292 --> 10:48.751
but other ways,
you guys are way ahead.

10:50.042 --> 10:51.083
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

10:53.876 --> 10:55.876
- That would get a guy killed

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
for saying that these days.
- Who cares?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.501
I mean, what fun would it be if
we were totally alike and equal?

11:02.542 --> 11:03.584
- Yeah, I guess.

11:04.542 --> 11:07.834
- Like, men are stronger than
women, you know, physically.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.876
I mean, and that's a turn-on,

11:09.959 --> 11:11.876
that's part of what we like
about you.

11:12.083 --> 11:13.876
- Well, l'm not that strong.

11:14.250 --> 11:15.918
- Yeah, but you could
knock me out.

11:16.918 --> 11:19.250
I mean, you could hold me down.

11:19.459 --> 11:22.584
If we were in a fight, you could
fuck me up really bad.

11:22.834 --> 11:23.876
- Okay.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.584
- l'm sorry, l'm being-
I'm being weird.

11:27.083 --> 11:29.626
- Yeah, kind of.
- Uh, it's just-

11:29.959 --> 11:31.167
You know, it's the truth.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.083
It's stupid to pretend
that it isn't.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.584
Men can run faster
and hit harder.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.083
I don't care how butch
or tough a woman is.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.417
When she's gotta move,

11:41.501 --> 11:43.667
she calls some guys to pick up
her furniture.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.834
And sure, she'll have
her hair in a ponytail

11:47.083 --> 11:48.751
and she'll put on a tank top.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.375
But at the end of the day,
there's gonna be some guys

11:52.751 --> 11:53.959
coming to lift that shit.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.042
Come on.

11:56.459 --> 11:57.501
- Yeah, true.

11:58.042 --> 11:59.083
But... uh...

11:59.792 --> 12:02.626
women are morally superior,
I think.

12:03.209 --> 12:04.667
- Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

12:04.918 --> 12:06.167
- Yeah, I think so. I mean,

12:06.250 --> 12:08.125
if I was gonna
trust someone,

12:08.209 --> 12:09.667
it would be a woman first.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.751
They're gentler
and more thoughtful.

12:16.918 --> 12:17.959
- You know, Pete.

12:19.083 --> 12:21.501
You have a lot more good
qualities than you think.

12:22.542 --> 12:23.751
- Why do you say that?

12:25.125 --> 12:26.584
- I think you
sell yourself short.

12:28.292 --> 12:30.209
- I don't.
I know I have good qualities.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.584
- You do?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.292
- Sure.
- Like what?

12:34.375 --> 12:35.626
l'm interested in what
you see in yourself.

12:35.709 --> 12:36.751
That's interesting.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.083
- I don't know.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.209
- Yes, you do.
You just said you do.

12:41.292 --> 12:42.542
Come on, tell me what
you know to be some

12:42.626 --> 12:43.667
of your good qualities.

12:46.542 --> 12:47.584
- Um...

12:49.709 --> 12:50.751
l'm fit.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.042
I mean, l'm not a fat guy.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.125
And, um...

12:57.709 --> 13:01.667
I think the left side of my face
is handsome.

13:01.751 --> 13:02.792
- You do?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.501
- Yeah, I do.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.000
I mean, when I look at myself
from that angle,

13:08.167 --> 13:09.792
I know it looks good.

13:11.209 --> 13:12.250
- Wow.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.501
Good.

13:15.334 --> 13:16.375
That's attractive.

13:17.584 --> 13:19.751
Well, that you're aware
of your own good looks.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.334
What else is good about you?

13:24.792 --> 13:25.834
- Um...

13:26.626 --> 13:27.834
I have a good memory.

13:28.334 --> 13:29.584
- You do?

13:29.667 --> 13:31.125
- Yeah, kind of
a perfect memory.

13:31.459 --> 13:33.709
- Like, you remember
a lot of detail or you remember

13:33.792 --> 13:34.834
very far back?

13:35.167 --> 13:36.209
- Both.

13:37.876 --> 13:39.876
- Well, what's-
What's an early memory?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.792
Like, what's your
earliest memory?

13:43.626 --> 13:44.876
- Uh...

13:44.959 --> 13:46.209
Like, Easter.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.542
- Easter?

13:47.626 --> 13:48.834
- Yeah, when I was three.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.042
- Was it nice?

13:52.209 --> 13:53.626
- I don't remember
the whole day,

13:53.876 --> 13:56.167
but I remember a lot of Easters,

13:56.375 --> 13:59.334
because it's a big
thing at the bar.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.667
You know, at our- at our place.

14:02.626 --> 14:05.042
Yeah, every year, we do a big
shindig on Easter.

14:05.542 --> 14:06.584
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

14:07.584 --> 14:12.417
So this Easter, when I was
three, there was this

14:12.501 --> 14:15.751
very old guy and I guess he came
into the place a lot,

14:16.250 --> 14:17.459
and he came that Easter,

14:18.542 --> 14:20.250
and you know, I was there with
all the other kids

14:20.334 --> 14:24.334
and we were eating some kind of
chocolate, and this old guy,

14:24.959 --> 14:26.000
he, uh-

14:28.125 --> 14:31.083
he bends over and he gets this
really weird look on his face,

14:31.167 --> 14:34.751
and he's holding a paper plate
with ham on it or something,

14:35.626 --> 14:37.626
and then all of a sudden,
he drops the plate,

14:38.959 --> 14:40.167
and he starts throwing up,

14:40.626 --> 14:43.334
like, black blood
all over the floor.

14:44.542 --> 14:45.584
Um... and, uh...

14:47.167 --> 14:48.375
- Oh, my God.
- And he-

14:48.792 --> 14:49.834
And he died.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.292
- Oh, my God.

14:52.918 --> 14:53.959
- Yeah.

14:54.292 --> 14:55.542
And...

14:55.626 --> 14:58.083
You know, the second he fell,
we could all smell

14:58.167 --> 15:00.083
that he shit himself,

15:00.417 --> 15:03.167
and even though I was three,
I knew he was dead.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.334
And ever since then, I haven't
been able to eat chocolate.

15:08.459 --> 15:09.501
- Jesus.

15:10.542 --> 15:11.584
That's horrible.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.334
- Well, I said I had
a good memory,

15:15.083 --> 15:16.542
not that I have good memories.

15:23.292 --> 15:26.167
Well, what are some of your good
qualities that you're aware of?

15:26.501 --> 15:27.542
- Um...

15:29.709 --> 15:30.751
Oh, God.

15:31.459 --> 15:33.125
- Come on, what do you got?
- Mm.

15:35.876 --> 15:36.918
l'm good at...

15:39.334 --> 15:40.375
Nothing.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.125
Pretty much.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.292
Oh, no, this is lame.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.918
I made you do it and you
knocked it out of the park

15:46.000 --> 15:47.459
and now l'm just- l'm bombing.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.918
- No, it's like
you said, we're-

15:49.000 --> 15:52.834
We're not equals, so maybe
that's something that I can do

15:52.918 --> 15:53.959
that you can't.

15:54.501 --> 15:55.542
- Yeah.
I guess so.

15:57.292 --> 15:58.959
- So let me do it for you.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.292
- What?

16:01.626 --> 16:02.667
- Here, look at me.

16:05.542 --> 16:06.584
Okay, so...

16:08.375 --> 16:09.417
You have pretty eyes.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.042
And you have...

16:13.667 --> 16:16.792
Your hair is shiny
and bouncy and...

16:17.292 --> 16:18.751
- Well, it must be my shampoo.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.584
- I'm not done.
Look at me.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.417
You have a cute smile.

16:28.876 --> 16:29.918
And...

16:31.542 --> 16:32.584
You're smart.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.000
You're brave.

16:35.334 --> 16:36.375
You're kind.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.042
You listen.

16:38.501 --> 16:39.709
You put yourself out there.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.000
And...

16:42.667 --> 16:43.709
You're decent.

16:45.626 --> 16:46.667
You're humble.

16:48.459 --> 16:49.501
Honest.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.000
You're different.

16:53.918 --> 16:54.959
- Different?

16:56.042 --> 16:57.083
- Yeah, you're-

16:57.542 --> 17:00.501
You're totally, utterly
different from any girl

17:00.584 --> 17:01.626
I've ever met.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.083
Woman, I mean.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.709
- Girl is fine.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.876

17:46.417 --> 17:47.626
- Did you close up downstairs?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.042
- Yeah, I closed up.

17:59.292 --> 18:00.542
Should I open the wine?

18:00.667 --> 18:01.918
- Yeah, if you want.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.459
I mean, I don't think that's
the kind of wine where it gets

18:05.542 --> 18:07.959
better when you let it breathe
or anything like that.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.250
- You don't think
I got good wine?

18:11.334 --> 18:12.542
I thought it was good.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.459
25 bucks for the bottle.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.083
- I'm- l'm sure it's fine,
l'm just saying,

18:17.167 --> 18:18.626
I don't think it's that kind.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.501
- Well, what are you
basing that on?

18:20.584 --> 18:22.250
Did you look at it?
- Not really.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.375
- Then why do you say that?

18:25.459 --> 18:26.501
- I don't know, Pete.

18:31.292 --> 18:33.250
- I feel like you're trying to
make me feel bad

18:33.334 --> 18:34.542
about the wine I got.

18:34.792 --> 18:35.834
- That's in your head.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.417
- Okay, fuck you, Horace.

18:38.542 --> 18:40.542
- What?
What did I do?

18:40.709 --> 18:42.375
- Make a comment and then
you don't stand behind it.

18:42.459 --> 18:43.709
And then-
And then you try and make me

18:43.792 --> 18:45.000
feel like l'm being crazy.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.542
- Well, you are being crazy.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.751
- Yeah, like I said,
fuck you.

18:50.667 --> 18:51.709
- What time is it?

18:52.250 --> 18:53.292
- It's around 7:00 almost.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.083
- What is he upset about?

18:57.375 --> 18:58.626
- l'm not.

18:58.709 --> 19:02.584
He makes a comment about the
wine and then he pretends like

19:02.667 --> 19:03.709
nothing happened.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.459
- It's fine.
You got good wine, Pete.

19:06.584 --> 19:07.792
- I didn't say he didn't.

19:08.209 --> 19:09.250
- You know, Horace, just-

19:10.209 --> 19:12.125
Stop your pressing his fucking
buttons with your

19:12.542 --> 19:13.792
passive-aggressive shit.

19:13.876 --> 19:14.918
- Okay, fine.

19:16.501 --> 19:18.876
- The guy in the wine store said
that this was a good wine

19:18.959 --> 19:20.209
for the price,

19:20.292 --> 19:22.417
and that if you open it up
an hour before you eat,

19:22.501 --> 19:24.250
it gives it time to breathe
and for the aromatic-

19:24.334 --> 19:27.167
- Well, he's the wine guy, don't
ask me, I'm not the wine guy.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.501
- Well, why do you
take it upon yourself-

19:28.584 --> 19:30.042
- 'Cause you fucking
asked me, Pete.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.709
- Horace, where'd you
get these spices?

19:33.626 --> 19:35.000
- I don't know, those are the-
those are the spices.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.334
- They've just sort
of been here?

19:36.417 --> 19:37.459
- Yeah.

19:38.042 --> 19:40.501
Grandma got some
and Mom probably got some.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.167
Marsha, I guess, bought some.

19:46.292 --> 19:47.542
Jesus Christ, Sylvia.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.292
- I'm not living with
a dead person's spices.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.626
It's morbid.

19:50.709 --> 19:53.125
When I die, you can get rid of
these, too.

19:57.709 --> 19:58.959
- l'm opening the wine.

19:59.042 --> 20:00.292
- Yeah, that's
a really good idea, Pete.

20:00.834 --> 20:01.876
- Fuck you.
- Uh-huh.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.792
- Hey, Sylvia, thanks for
cooking up a big dinner.

20:12.876 --> 20:14.542
- I'm not cooking up
a big dinner.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.918
I would have loved to cook a big
dinner, Pete, but you only told

20:17.042 --> 20:18.709
me about this a few hours ago.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.834
You know, I'm making pasta
and I got some meatballs already

20:22.918 --> 20:23.959
cooked from the deli.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.709
- Well, thanks for that.

20:28.042 --> 20:29.083
- Look at Chris Christie.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.334
Look at that face.

20:32.876 --> 20:33.918
God damn it.

20:35.209 --> 20:36.250
He's done.

20:38.209 --> 20:39.834
- l'm thinking, like, Trump
has something over him.

20:40.167 --> 20:41.417
- Right?
- Something, right?

20:41.501 --> 20:42.751
- Yeah.
- It's gotta be.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.417
How does Trump-
I mean, no matter what he does,

20:44.501 --> 20:45.709
no matter what he says,

20:46.501 --> 20:47.751
he just keeps getting stronger.

20:47.834 --> 20:48.876
- No, it's-

20:49.375 --> 20:50.626
I think that the Republicans,

20:50.709 --> 20:52.375
that's why they
have to stop him.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.876
Like, they gotta forget
this election,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.792
stop Trump and then
that'll save them,

20:57.876 --> 21:00.083
because it's like, even if you
don't like them, you'd have to

21:00.167 --> 21:02.042
admire them for that.
- That's not the point, guys.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.375
It's guys.

21:03.459 --> 21:04.501
It's all guys.

21:05.334 --> 21:06.709
It's all about the boys,
you know?

21:06.792 --> 21:08.709
You think maybe
it's time for a woman.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.042
- You really think that
if Hillary was president,

21:12.125 --> 21:13.375
this would all be better?

21:13.459 --> 21:14.709
Like, she would do a better-
- I'm just saying, we've had-

21:14.792 --> 21:17.209
We've had 44 men
in a row in that job

21:17.334 --> 21:18.584
and the world is going to shit.

21:18.667 --> 21:19.918
So how about you
try a woman?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.250
You know, just to try it.

21:21.334 --> 21:22.584
- Just, any woman?

21:22.667 --> 21:23.709
- Yes, any woman.

21:26.542 --> 21:27.751
All right, here we go.

21:30.417 --> 21:31.459
- Hey, guys?

21:31.751 --> 21:32.959
Can we just be, uh...

21:34.000 --> 21:35.876
Okay?

21:36.542 --> 21:37.584
Horace.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.167
Sorry.
Hi, Jenny.

21:48.667 --> 21:49.709
- Hi, Pete.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.501
Hi.

21:52.584 --> 21:54.584
- Oh, this is my brother
and sister, this is Horace.

21:54.667 --> 21:55.918
- Nice to meet you.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.709
- Sylvia.
- Hi.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.042
- Hello.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.584
- Nice to, um...
- Come on in.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.167
- I brought wine.

22:02.626 --> 22:03.667
- Oh.
- Nothing fancy.

22:04.709 --> 22:05.959
- All right, 'cause I got-

22:06.042 --> 22:07.918
- Pete bought wine, honey,
and he's very anxious about it,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.209
so let's serve his wine.

22:09.876 --> 22:11.125
- That's okay.

22:11.209 --> 22:12.542
You don't have to open this now.

22:12.626 --> 22:14.083
You can have it another time.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.209
- Dinner will be ready
as soon as this water boils.

22:17.876 --> 22:18.918
- Okay, um, no hurry.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.626
- Um...
- Want to have a seat?

22:26.709 --> 22:27.751
- Sure.
- Yeah.

22:35.918 --> 22:36.959
- Oh, thank you.

22:50.751 --> 22:51.959
- So where are you from?

22:52.375 --> 22:53.584
- I grew up in Michigan.

22:54.042 --> 22:55.083
- Mm, what part?

22:56.209 --> 22:58.292
- Do you know Michigan?
- No.

22:58.375 --> 22:59.417
- Oh. It's-

23:00.083 --> 23:02.667
It's a really small town
called Engadine.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.501
- Sylvia, do you need to wash
the pots or so- You wanna?

23:09.501 --> 23:10.542
- Yeah.

23:16.542 --> 23:17.584
- Hi.
- Hi there.

23:18.626 --> 23:19.667
- Nice to, uh...

23:19.959 --> 23:21.000
Pete: Mm.

23:22.459 --> 23:23.501
- ... meet you.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.125
- So, Michigan-
Engadine, Michigan?

23:27.334 --> 23:28.375
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.751
- Yeah, Engadine is-

23:31.834 --> 23:34.501
It's in the U.P.
- Uh-huh.

23:34.834 --> 23:36.751
- What they call the upper
peninsula, in Michigan.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.083
- Is it cold up there?

23:40.209 --> 23:41.667
- In the winter, yeah.
Horace: Right.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.250
- Yeah, Jenny was telling me

23:43.334 --> 23:46.083
that when her dad died,
it was the winter,

23:46.167 --> 23:48.083
and they couldn't
bury him until the thaw.

23:49.209 --> 23:50.459
You know, the ground
was too hard.

23:50.542 --> 23:51.584
- Wow, that's...
Horace: Mhm.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.250
- That's...

23:53.334 --> 23:54.584
- Just saying, that's
how cold it is.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.709
- Yeah.

24:00.918 --> 24:01.959
So, how'd you guys...

24:03.292 --> 24:04.584
How'd you end up
here from Michigan?

24:04.667 --> 24:05.918
How did you end up in-

24:06.000 --> 24:07.459
- I- I went to
Brooklyn College.

24:08.167 --> 24:09.417
- Brooklyn College?

24:09.501 --> 24:11.125
I thought just New York kids
went there.

24:11.209 --> 24:14.083
- I really wanted to live
in New York, since I was little.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.626
Sylvia: Uh-huh.
- It was my dream.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.292
Brooklyn College was the only
school I could get into

24:19.375 --> 24:20.417
that I could afford.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.667
It's funny, I pictured
living in Manhattan,

24:23.751 --> 24:25.918
but I've only been to Manhattan
maybe three times

24:26.459 --> 24:27.501
since I got here.

24:28.042 --> 24:29.292
- And how long ago was that?

24:29.375 --> 24:31.542
That you got here?
That you were in college?

24:31.709 --> 24:32.751
- l'm- I'm 26.

24:33.667 --> 24:34.709
- Got it.

24:39.542 --> 24:41.000
- So, uh...
- How'd you guys meet?

24:42.542 --> 24:43.792
- We met online,
I told you that.

24:43.876 --> 24:44.918
- Yes, you did.

24:46.167 --> 24:47.417
- Yeah.

24:47.501 --> 24:48.959
I know it's kinda lame, but...

24:50.167 --> 24:52.334
It's just not easy to meet
people these days.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.292
- I've also heard that online
relationships don't last,

24:56.375 --> 24:58.292
but Pete seems pretty darn
serious about you.

24:58.709 --> 24:59.751
- Sylvia.

25:00.459 --> 25:01.501
Come on, I-

25:01.834 --> 25:03.292
I didn't say we were serious.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.709
- It's okay.

25:05.501 --> 25:06.542
We are serious.

25:07.792 --> 25:08.834
l'm crazy about Pete.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.959
- That's nice.
- That's terrific.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.083
- Yeah.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.417
- l'm gonna pour some wine.

25:24.876 --> 25:25.918
- Is everything okay?

25:26.417 --> 25:28.250
l'm- l'm sensing that
there's something-

25:28.334 --> 25:29.542
- No, no, it's all right.

25:29.751 --> 25:32.000
- No, you're-
Pete's new girl, you know.

25:32.459 --> 25:35.083
Since you guys are so serious,
we're getting to know you.

25:36.501 --> 25:37.542
- Well, I appreciate that.

25:39.834 --> 25:43.167
Maybe you could consider
that I'm pretty nervous and,

25:44.125 --> 25:47.918
so you're not really seeing me
as I am right now, because...

25:49.000 --> 25:50.042
Well, this is weird.

25:50.751 --> 25:52.626
- What's weird about it?
That you're half his age?

25:52.709 --> 25:53.751
- Sylvie.
- Come on.

25:54.584 --> 25:56.417
Sylvia, stop.
That's- You're being mean.

25:56.667 --> 25:58.876
- I am?
- Yeah, pretty fucking mean.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.042
- Uh, the pasta.

26:01.375 --> 26:02.417
- Oh, yeah.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.584
- Can we-
Should we sit?

26:14.959 --> 26:16.626
- Listen, don't-

26:16.709 --> 26:18.417
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

26:18.542 --> 26:19.792
- Worry about what?
We're fine.

26:19.876 --> 26:22.167
- Nothing, nothing, it's okay.

26:28.626 --> 26:30.542
Should I sit down?
- Yeah.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.125
Here you go.
- Thanks.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.042
- Thank you.

26:52.209 --> 26:53.459
- Ah, coming through.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.292
- This looks good.

27:30.167 --> 27:31.209
Thank you.
- Yeah.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.125
- Thank you.

27:39.501 --> 27:40.542
- You want some cheese?

27:40.876 --> 27:41.918
- Please.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.042
- Thank you.
Sylvia: Mm-hm.

28:00.375 --> 28:01.417
- Oh, excuse me.

28:02.542 --> 28:03.584
Um...

28:04.542 --> 28:06.709
Jenny's a Baptist, so she's
accustomed to saying grace.

28:07.417 --> 28:08.667
- Really?

28:08.751 --> 28:09.792
- It's okay, we really-

28:10.125 --> 28:11.542
We don't have to.
- Yeah, we don't-

28:11.626 --> 28:12.834
We don't say grace here.

28:13.918 --> 28:15.751
- Well, it wouldn't
kill us to say grace.

28:15.834 --> 28:16.876
I mean...

28:18.083 --> 28:20.959
I mean, you know, if someone who
is present who says grace,

28:21.709 --> 28:22.959
especially if they're a guest,

28:23.042 --> 28:24.959
I think we could
do her the honor.

28:25.083 --> 28:26.125
- That's-

28:26.959 --> 28:28.000
That's fine with me.

28:31.584 --> 28:32.834
- I feel funny.

28:32.918 --> 28:35.542
- No, go ahead, by all means,
say grace at our table.

28:36.501 --> 28:37.751
- Go ahead.
Go ahead, Jenny.

28:37.834 --> 28:39.501
- Pete, don't-
- Don't make her do it.

28:42.876 --> 28:45.042
- Why don't you say it?
You should say it, Pete.

28:46.042 --> 28:47.083
All right.

28:50.501 --> 28:53.834
Um, thank you God for this meal.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.292
Thank you for our food.

28:58.125 --> 29:01.167
And... thank you
for bringing us Jenny, um...

29:03.626 --> 29:05.083
to share this meal with us.

29:06.834 --> 29:09.626
And thank you, um...

29:10.626 --> 29:11.667
For our blessings.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.918
Thanks for our brother
and sister.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.918
- You fuck.
You're gonna lie to God now?

29:16.209 --> 29:18.250
- Sylvia.
- Well?

29:18.334 --> 29:19.375
- What?

29:21.125 --> 29:22.167
- He's not our brother.

29:22.584 --> 29:24.876
Horace and I are brother
and sister, Pete's our cousin.

29:24.959 --> 29:26.167
- Oh.
- It's not that simple.

29:26.584 --> 29:28.709
Sylvia: Well...
- We- We grew up as siblings,

29:29.334 --> 29:30.584
in our childhood and then
we found out late-

29:30.667 --> 29:33.876
- Okay, do you mind
if I tell my life?

29:35.125 --> 29:37.542
At my own choice?
- You brought her here, Pete.

29:37.626 --> 29:39.083
What?
Did you want us to lie, too?

29:39.167 --> 29:40.375
- It's not a lie. I-

29:42.417 --> 29:44.834
What the fuck
do you care what I tell her?

29:45.751 --> 29:48.042
- l'm just saying, you bring
somebody home,

29:48.834 --> 29:51.250
you know, and you want us all to
be family with her or whatever

29:51.334 --> 29:53.751
your fantasy is, you think you'd
tell her the truth.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.417
And yes, Jenny,
I have cancer, by the way.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.083
- Oh, l'm sorry.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.417
- I mean, Pete, I saw
the look on her face.

29:59.501 --> 30:01.417
You could have done the poor
girl a favor, you know, when you

30:01.501 --> 30:03.209
invited her, you could have
said, oh, by the way,

30:03.292 --> 30:04.542
my sister- my cousin,

30:04.876 --> 30:07.459
has cancer, so she
didn't have to look horrified

30:07.542 --> 30:08.792
when she walked in the door.

30:08.876 --> 30:09.918
- I wasn't horrified.

30:10.292 --> 30:11.334
- Okay, Jenny?

30:13.501 --> 30:18.083
This is my cousin,
Sylvia and my cousin, Horace.

30:19.626 --> 30:20.667
And Sylvia has cancer.

30:22.375 --> 30:26.626
And we used to be brother
and sister, until the man

30:26.709 --> 30:28.083
who I thought was my uncle

30:28.167 --> 30:30.542
dropped the news
that he was my father,

30:31.584 --> 30:32.792
and then he shot himself.

30:34.751 --> 30:35.792
Okay?
Is that enough?

30:36.542 --> 30:38.209
Is that honest enough for you,
Sylvia?

30:38.876 --> 30:40.125
Because apparently,

30:40.209 --> 30:43.584
<i>I have to ask you what
I can tell or not tell</i>

30:43.667 --> 30:45.125
the girl l'm in love with?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.042
- Pete.
- Well, actually, I-

30:48.709 --> 30:50.000
I do think there is more
you could tell her.

30:50.083 --> 30:51.334
Horace: No, don't. Don't.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.667
- What? I just think if they're
in love,

30:52.792 --> 30:54.042
she has
a right to know.

30:54.125 --> 30:55.375
- Maybe don't tell me.

30:55.459 --> 30:56.501
Horace: Don't say it.

30:57.042 --> 30:58.083
Sylvia, don't say it.

30:59.334 --> 31:00.584
- All right, never mind.

31:00.667 --> 31:01.709
Horace: Just...
- Never mind!

31:03.042 --> 31:04.083
Sorry, Jenny.

31:04.417 --> 31:05.459
- It's okay.

31:06.876 --> 31:07.918
Kind of.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.918
- No, really, I'm-
I'm very sorry.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.125
I truly do apologize.
You must be in hell.

31:18.792 --> 31:20.042
You seem like
a very nice person

31:20.125 --> 31:22.626
and this has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

31:22.918 --> 31:24.209
- It's really- It's okay,
whenever you go

31:24.459 --> 31:26.375
to meet a guy's family,
it's always...

31:26.459 --> 31:27.834
- It's just that when you get to
be older, you're gonna see guys

31:28.000 --> 31:29.501
his age with a girl your age,

31:29.584 --> 31:31.250
it's gonna make
you want to puke.

31:31.626 --> 31:33.542
Of course, it doesn't now,
but it will.

31:34.709 --> 31:35.751
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.417
Oh, my God.

31:38.042 --> 31:40.918
- Is there any way at all we
could talk about something else?

31:41.292 --> 31:43.375
Pete: Yes. Please.

31:46.918 --> 31:47.959
- Well, let's see.

31:48.292 --> 31:49.542
Before you got here,

31:49.626 --> 31:52.167
the boys and I were discussing
Hillary Clinton.

31:52.292 --> 31:54.834
I was just saying that
after all the war and graft,

31:54.918 --> 31:57.542
I thought maybe it was time to
let a woman have a try.

31:57.626 --> 31:58.876
What do you think?

31:58.959 --> 32:00.000
- I, um...

32:00.626 --> 32:02.459
I like it better when
a man is president.

32:05.918 --> 32:09.375
- Pete is a heavily
medicated outpatient...

32:10.209 --> 32:11.459
of a mental hospital.

32:13.584 --> 32:15.876
- What?
- Horace.

32:16.375 --> 32:18.751
- He takes something
called Probitol.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.918
If he doesn't take it, he has-

32:22.459 --> 32:24.751
He thinks there's snakes
and monsters everywhere.

32:24.876 --> 32:25.918
He starts screaming.

32:26.542 --> 32:27.584
- Wait.

32:28.083 --> 32:29.125
Pete...

32:29.751 --> 32:30.959
- Why'd you just say that?

32:31.792 --> 32:32.834
- Well...

32:36.751 --> 32:37.792
- Pete, is that true?

32:40.209 --> 32:41.250
- Yes.
Jesus.

32:42.167 --> 32:43.209
Uh...

32:43.834 --> 32:46.250
Yeah, he had a psychotic
breakdown when he was 16.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.292
He was committed to a mental
hospital when he was 25

32:50.417 --> 32:52.792
and lived there on and off

32:53.334 --> 32:58.083
and 'til they invented
Probitol, thank God,

32:58.375 --> 33:00.751
depending on who you ask,
and now he is, you know,

33:00.834 --> 33:02.083
a stable enough man,

33:02.167 --> 33:03.834
he lives in
a little room downstairs,

33:04.083 --> 33:05.125
pushes the broom around,

33:05.792 --> 33:07.709
unless the drug
has him in a stupor.

33:08.334 --> 33:09.375
That's Pete.

33:09.918 --> 33:11.542
Jenny, this is Pete.
Meet Pete.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.918
You ready to take that on?

33:15.292 --> 33:16.334
All of 26?

33:17.792 --> 33:20.417
You ready to handle that and all
that that comes with?

33:20.792 --> 33:22.375
'Til you see him
into his old age

33:22.459 --> 33:23.918
in all of, like, 20 years
from now?

33:29.083 --> 33:30.334
- Fuck.

33:30.417 --> 33:32.000
- What? Come on.
What, it's fine.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.000
We are a family.
Everybody eat your pasta.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.083
- I... I better go.

33:47.334 --> 33:48.375
For the record,

33:49.834 --> 33:51.042
I don't know you guys.

33:52.334 --> 33:53.375
But that was mean,

33:54.709 --> 33:56.375
the way you
just told me that.

33:58.667 --> 34:02.083
And I don't care if he's your
brother or your cousin.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.834
I wouldn't treat a dog the way
you just treated Pete.

34:04.918 --> 34:05.959
I'm sorry.
No, that's-

34:07.292 --> 34:10.542
That's rude to say, but, you
don't seem exactly concerned

34:10.667 --> 34:12.333
with how you talk to me, so...

34:15.708 --> 34:16.751
l'm gonna go.

34:17.501 --> 34:18.542
Pete...

34:21.417 --> 34:22.458
Okay.

34:23.583 --> 34:24.626
Good night.
- Good night.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.333
- You know, Sylvie,

34:46.708 --> 34:50.125
if you really loved me,
this all would have

34:50.208 --> 34:51.250
been okay...

34:53.667 --> 34:55.083
if you really

34:55.167 --> 34:59.792
<i>ever showed me any love.</i>

35:18.834 --> 35:19.876
- She seemed really nice.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.250
- This country's going
to shit in a handbag.

35:34.042 --> 35:35.083
This is good.
