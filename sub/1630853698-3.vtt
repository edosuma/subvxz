WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:05.831
- I realized when I met Maya,

00:05.962 --> 00:08.269
I needed to be with someone
who has the same dreams as me.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.053
- You found someone new.
You kicked me to the curb.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.359
- She and I are flying back out
with National Geographic

00:11.489 --> 00:12.621
at the end of that week.

00:12.751 --> 00:14.318
- Next week?

00:14.449 --> 00:15.450
Well, what am I gonna do
with the Cougar, huh?

00:15.580 --> 00:16.451
What am I gonna do
with the Cougar?

00:16.581 --> 00:17.582
You think about that at all?

00:17.713 --> 00:18.496
- What are you doing?

00:18.627 --> 00:20.237
- I'm proposing.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.283
- I'm just not in love
with you anymore, Mikey.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.675
- Stacey Ross.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.286
You recognize me?

00:25.416 --> 00:26.591
- I'm sorry.
I don't remember.

00:26.722 --> 00:27.810
It's good to see you again,

00:27.940 --> 00:29.855
even if you didn't
like my dancing.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.640
Yeah, of course, I'd be here.
I live here.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.424
And it's my name on the lease.

00:33.555 --> 00:34.425
- Your father's name,
don't you mean?

00:34.556 --> 00:35.687
- Same difference.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.863
Oh, what the hell?

00:37.994 --> 00:39.996
- Throw down my keys!

00:40.127 --> 00:42.433
- Yeah, once he gets in a cab,
I'll throw 'em down.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.000
- I'll gladly get a cab
if it means

00:44.131 --> 00:46.350
I don't have to listen
to any more of her bullshit!

00:51.616 --> 00:54.271
- So, Jimmy Boy,
you must be excited.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.447
I mean, tomorrow's
the big day, right?

00:56.578 --> 00:57.840
- Yeah, she's flying
in around noon, meet the folks,

00:57.970 --> 00:59.450
have dinner,

00:59.581 --> 01:01.670
then it's bon voyage
in the a.m.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.628
- Some fucking friend you are,

01:03.759 --> 01:05.239
leaving me alone
for three months

01:05.369 --> 01:06.675
with this sad sack to deal with.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.546
- You know, I'm glad

01:08.677 --> 01:10.287
you guys think
my heartbreak is funny, okay?

01:10.418 --> 01:12.811
But it's not.
This shit fucking hurts, dude.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.248
- No, nobody finds
anything funny, okay?

01:14.378 --> 01:15.771
We understand.

01:15.901 --> 01:16.989
It just--it's still weird

01:17.120 --> 01:19.079
seeing you
of all people like this.

01:19.209 --> 01:21.864
You know, the big stud
with all the muscles now

01:21.994 --> 01:23.822
moping around in this old robe

01:23.953 --> 01:27.348
and tears in his eyes all day,
every day.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.524
It's unexpected.

01:29.654 --> 01:33.397
- And sad but not in, you know,
a kind of endearing way,

01:33.528 --> 01:35.486
more like a pathetic
kind of way.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.619
- Oh, yeah, well,
I don't give a shit, okay?

01:37.749 --> 01:39.360
Because look at me.
You see this?

01:39.490 --> 01:41.013
This is what
a heartache looks like.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.364
- Oh, well, we see
that very clearly, Mikey.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.670
It's very apparent.
"It's A Heartache."

01:45.801 --> 01:46.932
That's a good song
by the way, right?

01:47.063 --> 01:48.978
Bonnie Tyler.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.371
It's gotta be one of the best
breakup songs of all time.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.591
- Well, I don't know
if I'd go that far.

01:53.722 --> 01:56.116
I reserve that slot
for "Babe" by Styx.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.335
- Oh, that's a big
fucking surprise there.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.685
Okay, all right,
I'll let you have that

02:00.816 --> 02:02.948
'cause I know they hold
a special place in your heart.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.387
But come on, Pags.
All-time greatest?

02:06.517 --> 02:09.172
- All right, fine.
Hall & Oates, "She's Gone."

02:09.303 --> 02:11.653
- Okay, now that's an answer.
I can top it though.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.698
Carol King.
"It's Too Late."

02:13.829 --> 02:14.917
- "Tracks of My Tears."

02:15.047 --> 02:16.440
Smokey Robinson
and The Miracles.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.963
- Janice Joplin.
"Piece of my Heart."

02:18.094 --> 02:19.487
- "Jolene."
Dolly Parton.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.619
- "Angie" by the Stones.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.708
- Al Green, "How Can
You Mend a Broken Heart."

02:23.839 --> 02:26.407
- Fuck you.
That's a good one.

02:26.537 --> 02:27.799
"I Heard It
Through The Grapevine."

02:27.930 --> 02:31.760
The Marvin Gaye version
and the CCR version, two.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.849
- "If I Can't Have You."
Yvonne Elliman.

02:33.979 --> 02:34.893
- Damn,
that's another good one.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.678
- It's 'cause I know my shit.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.507
- "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."
Elton John and Kiki Dee.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.423
- "Ain't No Sunshine."
Bill motherfucking Withers.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.773
- Shit, you're
fucking good at this.

02:44.903 --> 02:47.079
- Hey, they don't call me the
music man for nothing, do they?

02:47.210 --> 02:48.603
- Who the fuck calls you
the music man?

02:48.733 --> 02:49.865
- You know,
I'm glad you guys are

02:49.995 --> 02:51.519
having a laugh at my expense,

02:51.649 --> 02:53.651
but if you're gonna be talking
about breakup songs,

02:53.782 --> 02:55.392
how do you leave out
"I Will Survive," huh?

02:55.523 --> 02:57.002
By Gloria Gaynor.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.221
- You know, Mikey,
you're right.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.047
- Do you have any idea
what day it is?

04:25.177 --> 04:26.831
It's my birthday.
I'm allowed to sleep in.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.703
- Really?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.531
Well, then what was
your excuse for yesterday,

04:30.661 --> 04:32.707
and the day before that,
and the day before that?

04:32.837 --> 04:35.536
- Oh, wait, what was that, Ma?
'Cause it's my birthday.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.712
You're not gonna be a huge pain
in the ass today.

04:37.842 --> 04:38.930
Oh, wow.
That's so sweet of you.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.063
- Well, then tell me this.

04:41.193 --> 04:42.760
How come you never have
to go to work anymore?

04:42.891 --> 04:44.501
Did you get fired again?

04:44.632 --> 04:46.721
- I told you I'm freelance.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.853
You deaf?
You know what that means?

04:48.984 --> 04:51.247
It means when they call,
I go to work.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.510
If they don't call,
I don't go to work.

04:53.641 --> 04:54.859
It's pretty freaking simple.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.078
- Okay, it's pretty
freaking simple.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.514
All right,
well, what's simple

04:57.645 --> 04:59.168
is you should just get
a full-time job.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.170
If you had a full-time job,
then I wouldn't find you here

05:01.301 --> 05:02.867
dressed in your outfit
from the night before.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.478
And you couldn't even
take your freaking shoes off?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.697
- Please just go away!

05:06.828 --> 05:09.134
- I'm gonna make some coffee.

05:09.265 --> 05:12.050
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.965
- Dad, can I get a refill?

05:14.096 --> 05:18.056
- A refill, of course,
for my favorite child.

05:18.187 --> 05:19.710
- Okay.
- Oh, favorite.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.277
- There you go.
- Oh.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.801
- Okay, Dad, come on.
- Did you see this?

05:23.932 --> 05:24.759
I didn't realize that
your brother moved back

05:24.889 --> 05:26.021
into the house.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.152
You still live here, huh?
- Come on.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.545
When are you gonna
talk to me again?

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
- When am I gonna talk
to you again?

05:30.112 --> 05:30.852
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
talk to you again.

05:30.982 --> 05:31.940
A kid who keeps secrets.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.594
Why I would ever
talk to you?

05:33.724 --> 05:34.595
- I'm not keeping se--I'm
trying to protect you

05:34.725 --> 05:35.509
'cause you're
a little sensitive.

05:35.639 --> 05:37.206
- Sensitive, sensitive?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.164
I think you have me confused
with somebody else, pal.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.863
- Can I have some coffee?
- Oh, yeah, sure, coffee?

05:41.993 --> 05:44.126
Coming right up.
There you go.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.650
- Oh, thank you.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.826
- Okay, are you gonna be cool
when Maya gets here?

05:48.957 --> 05:50.306
Remember, she's staying
with us tonight

05:50.437 --> 05:51.873
before we take off
to Sweden tomorrow.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.614
- Not only is he gonna be cool,
he's gonna be

05:53.744 --> 05:55.920
on his best behavior,
which means no sulking.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.140
- Sulking?
Since when do I sulk?

05:58.270 --> 05:59.663
- Dad, you're sulking
right now.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.317
Go look in the mirror.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.187
- You know, I don't have time
to look in the mirror

06:02.318 --> 06:03.885
because I have work to do

06:04.015 --> 06:06.278
on that beautiful car
out in the driveway,

06:06.409 --> 06:08.455
which is what I'm gonna do
right now.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.632
- Did he just call
that car beautiful?

06:11.762 --> 06:13.111
- Can you at least
bring the coffee back?

06:13.242 --> 06:14.852
- You know, I was thinking.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.638
- Oh, boy, I hope
you didn't hurt yourself.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.205
- Very funny.
You know that game,

06:20.336 --> 06:21.903
Guess Who I Am.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.339
I wanna play that with you,

06:23.470 --> 06:25.820
and I want you
to tell me who I sound like.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.691
- Are you fucking kidding me?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.346
- I used to dream
of working in fashion,

06:30.477 --> 06:33.654
but now I haven't had
a real job in six months.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.351
I also used
to live in the city

06:35.482 --> 06:37.875
but recently moved back
into my childhood bedroom

06:38.006 --> 06:39.137
to schnorr of my mother.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.096
And the topping on the cake--

06:41.226 --> 06:43.533
- I think you mean the icing
on the cake or to top it off,

06:43.664 --> 06:45.056
but go ahead.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.928
- The topping on the cake
is I no longer talk

06:47.058 --> 06:48.973
to my lifelong best friend

06:49.104 --> 06:51.062
because I'd let some guy get in
the middle of our friendship.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.890
Who am I?

06:53.021 --> 06:53.978
- Have you been up
all morning coming up

06:54.109 --> 06:55.197
with this stupid
little routine?

06:55.327 --> 06:56.764
Sitting out here
rehearsing your lines?

06:56.894 --> 06:59.157
'Cause that's fucking sad, Ma.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.985
- You need to figure out what
you're gonna do with your life.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.770
- My life is fine.
Leave me alone.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.685
- No, your life is not fine.

07:04.815 --> 07:07.122
You think being a party girl
is a fine life?

07:07.252 --> 07:08.906
- Party girl. What the hell
are you talking about?

07:09.037 --> 07:10.430
- A fine life is a life
where you're working

07:10.560 --> 07:12.997
on Seventh Avenue,
not mooching off your mother.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.435
A life where you're living
in the city, not here with me.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.220
A life where your boyfriend
is a nice guy,

07:18.350 --> 07:21.092
maybe like Jimmy
and not some older married man.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.964
- Wait, you like Jimmy now?
That's fucking new.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.879
And I told you,
that guy is not my boyfriend.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.271
- Oh, yeah.
Well, what is he then?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.491
