02:00.396 --> 02:01.345
Look.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.168
Egads.

02:09.614 --> 02:13.837
See, professor? The ancient carvings,
just as I promised you.

02:13.998 --> 02:16.300
So the legend is true.

02:30.416 --> 02:35.174
Yes. It's all here,
just as the manuscript describes.

02:35.345 --> 02:37.451
I've found it at last.

02:37.618 --> 02:42.255
Come, Pemba. The lost kingdom
of Shangri-la awaits.

02:43.698 --> 02:44.646
What?

02:44.818 --> 02:48.681
I am sorry, professor.
We dare not go further.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.574
These lands are forbidden.

02:50.739 --> 02:53.674
Forbidden? By whom?

02:54.355 --> 02:58.185
Look around. We're the only ones here.

03:03.093 --> 03:04.435
No...

03:04.597 --> 03:06.736
...we are not alone.

03:19.031 --> 03:20.493
We should not be here.

03:21.015 --> 03:22.903
He is coming.

03:23.448 --> 03:27.125
No, Pemba. We can't quit now,
not when we're so close.

03:27.512 --> 03:29.846
You do not understand. We must hurry.

03:31.192 --> 03:32.883
Then I'll go alone.

03:38.906 --> 03:40.728
Wait!

03:42.426 --> 03:44.248
Professor!

03:45.083 --> 03:47.287
Professor!

03:54.780 --> 03:56.187
No!

04:21.152 --> 04:24.218
I have seen the creature.

04:36.514 --> 04:41.435
Don't you just love Paris?
The city, the sights, the shopping.

04:41.602 --> 04:43.544
Isn't it romantic, Freddie?

04:43.714 --> 04:46.649
Oh, man, I think I'm in love.

04:47.651 --> 04:49.625
This new cell phone rocks.

04:49.795 --> 04:53.658
It's got hi-def video, an MP3 player,
even satellite GPS.

04:53.828 --> 04:55.868
I'm, like, totally geeking.

04:56.037 --> 04:58.884
Really? How can you tell?

04:59.973 --> 05:01.315
I don't know which is worse:

05:01.477 --> 05:03.998
Fred and his phone,
or you and your newspapers.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.435
I thought we were supposed
to be on vacation.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.547
We are.

05:07.717 --> 05:10.369
You know how I like reading
in a foreign language.

05:10.534 --> 05:12.128
Listen to this, gang.

05:12.295 --> 05:15.841
Climbers on Mount Everest claim
to have seen the abominable snowman...

05:16.007 --> 05:19.323
...a mysterious creature believed to exist
in the high Himalayas.

05:19.495 --> 05:21.699
Oh, no. Not this time, Velma.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.831
I don't care if it's in English,
French or Swahili.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.815
There will be no talk of mysteries
or monsters on this trip.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.089
Do you hear me?

05:29.993 --> 05:31.848
Yes, I hear you.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.563
Can I have my cheeks back now?

05:35.434 --> 05:38.663
Speaking of mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby
were supposed to meet us here...

05:38.826 --> 05:41.674
...over an hour ago.
Where could they be?

05:42.026 --> 05:46.783
Knowing those two, they've probably
been sidetracked by their stomachs.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.223
Yummy.

05:55.948 --> 05:57.574
What a great idea, Scoob.

05:57.740 --> 06:01.570
Like, I've always wanted
to fly an all-you-can-eat airline.

06:01.741 --> 06:04.676
Yeah, me too.

06:07.470 --> 06:11.180
Like, gee whiz. Shouldn't we have landed
in Paris by now?

06:17.807 --> 06:19.269
We're coming up on the drop zone.

06:20.016 --> 06:22.220
Mount Everest, dead ahead.

06:23.152 --> 06:27.626
Mount Everest, tallest mountain
in the world...

06:27.920 --> 06:31.019
...and home to the abominable snowman.

06:31.473 --> 06:34.670
- So you're really going through with this?
- But of course.

06:34.833 --> 06:39.307
I am Alphonse Lafleur,
the world's greatest hunter.

06:39.475 --> 06:43.305
Now, I come in search
of the world's greatest prize.

06:43.474 --> 06:46.344
But I thought the abominable snowman
is just a myth.

06:46.515 --> 06:49.515
How do you catch a monster
that may not even exist?

06:52.980 --> 06:56.428
With a bait no monster can resist.

07:00.981 --> 07:02.508
What can they want now?

07:03.253 --> 07:05.643
Hello, anybody home?

07:05.813 --> 07:07.090
Hello?

07:09.430 --> 07:14.516
And thank you for flying Alphonse
Lafleur's Le Monde Grande Tours.

07:14.679 --> 07:17.014
We are going to be landing very shortly.

07:17.495 --> 07:19.503
Boy, are we glad to hear that.

07:19.672 --> 07:23.567
Like, my stomach is already coming in
for a three-snack landing.

07:25.657 --> 07:28.974
- You have eaten everything?
- Almost.

07:29.145 --> 07:32.975
Like, I'm still saving the last slice
of peanut butter and pineapple pizza...

07:33.145 --> 07:35.349
...in case of an emergency.

07:38.618 --> 07:40.560
Hey.

07:42.394 --> 07:45.013
The pooch is still hungry, no?

07:45.179 --> 07:50.875
We have lots of yummy goodies
waiting for you in the VIP lounge.

07:51.644 --> 07:54.644
This is the VIP lounge?

07:56.796 --> 08:00.113
You are on the package tour, no?

08:01.790 --> 08:05.467
I didn't know that that meant
we were the package.

08:11.935 --> 08:13.113
You said it, Scoob.

08:13.279 --> 08:17.174
Like, I think we've just been bumped
from first class to worst class.

08:38.337 --> 08:43.008
Zoinks, like, now, we know
how it feels to be lost luggage.

08:49.828 --> 08:53.789
As if things weren't bad enough,
now my ears are ringing.

08:53.956 --> 08:57.252
Shaggy, cell phone. Cell phone.

08:57.701 --> 08:59.490
Hey, my cell phone.

08:59.654 --> 09:03.200
Like, world's worst vacation ever,
Shaggy speaking.

09:03.590 --> 09:07.300
Shaggy? I can barely hear you.
Where are you guys?

09:08.487 --> 09:09.861
Hang on, Freddie.

09:10.022 --> 09:15.773
Like, I think Scoob and I are about to go
from frequent fliers to frequent criers.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.022
Shaggy? Scooby?

09:23.016 --> 09:24.293
I've lost their signal.

09:24.457 --> 09:27.043
Can't you trace it with that high-tech
GPS thingy?

09:27.209 --> 09:32.261
Oh, yeah. With global positioning, I should
be able to pinpoint their exact location.

09:33.161 --> 09:36.423
Just a little satellite tracking,
and viola!

09:37.995 --> 09:39.522
Wait, this can't be right.

09:40.075 --> 09:41.569
Look.

09:41.739 --> 09:43.201
- The Himalayas?
- The Himalayas?

09:43.883 --> 09:45.225
Home to Mount Everest.

09:45.388 --> 09:48.617
And the headline-making mystery
of the abominable snowman.

09:48.779 --> 09:52.075
Now, hold on. Just because
there's a mysterious monster on the loose...

09:52.236 --> 09:55.881
...it doesn't necessarily mean that Shaggy
and Scooby are going to get in trouble.

09:56.781 --> 09:58.090
Does it?

10:01.742 --> 10:05.125
We've got to get to Mount Everest.
Everybody in the van.

10:05.518 --> 10:09.709
Sorry, Daphne, but it looks like you're
trading in your new heels for snowshoes.

10:09.871 --> 10:15.239
Oh, just once, I'd like to have a vacation
that stays a vacation.

10:23.185 --> 10:25.357
Like, elevator going down.

11:03.446 --> 11:05.235
I'm very sorry, Pemba.

11:05.654 --> 11:09.266
I don't know what came over me.
I should never have cut that rope.

11:09.430 --> 11:11.798
Without you, I quickly became lost...

11:11.959 --> 11:15.123
...and wandered in the blinding
snowstorm for hours.

11:15.288 --> 11:17.939
I barely made it back here alive.

11:18.648 --> 11:21.136
It is my own fault, professor.

11:21.304 --> 11:24.653
I should not have taken you
as far as the forbidden lands.

11:25.081 --> 11:26.674
But you did, Pemba.

11:26.841 --> 11:30.584
And now the discovery of a lifetime
is still within our grasp.

11:30.746 --> 11:33.649
The lost kingdom of Shangri-la...

11:33.818 --> 11:36.023
...hidden from mankind for centuries.

11:36.187 --> 11:38.554
Why, it's an archeologist's dream.

11:38.715 --> 11:42.196
And it's right up there,
just waiting for me.

11:42.364 --> 11:45.561
I mean, for us, of course.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.308
It's waiting for us.

11:48.476 --> 11:51.324
You may be right, but you forget.

11:51.484 --> 11:54.038
Something else is waiting there too.

11:54.717 --> 11:55.829
Don't you see?

11:55.997 --> 11:59.795
The abominable snowman must be guarding
the secret entrance.

11:59.965 --> 12:04.090
- That's how close we are.
- No. You do not understand.

12:04.255 --> 12:08.281
We have angered the creature,
and now he will seek his revenge.

12:08.671 --> 12:12.249
That is why everyone
is fleeing the village.

12:14.015 --> 12:16.471
Not everyone, it seems.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.386
Minga.

12:20.192 --> 12:24.503
- What are you doing here?
- I've brought you some hot tea.

12:24.673 --> 12:26.528
No, I mean...

12:29.377 --> 12:31.068
Hey, I'm listening to that.

12:31.714 --> 12:34.911
Why are you still in the village?
You should be leaving with the others.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.853
I'm not a little girl anymore, Pemba.

12:38.019 --> 12:41.631
You can stop trying to frighten me
with your monster stories now.

12:42.948 --> 12:45.850
Please excuse my sister, professor.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.192
She is as stubborn as a yak.

12:49.765 --> 12:53.475
So, Minga, you don't believe
in the abominable snowman?

12:53.925 --> 12:57.472
When I was younger,
Pemba used to try to scare me.

12:57.637 --> 13:00.191
"The yeti is going to get you."

13:02.182 --> 13:06.525
Now he's going around telling everyone
that he's actually seen the creature.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.604
I am not kidding this time.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.899
The yeti is real.

13:16.969 --> 13:21.279
We may be freezing cold,
but we're coming in hot.

13:41.868 --> 13:42.915
Egads.

13:43.788 --> 13:46.822
Are you all right?
Did you break anything?

13:46.989 --> 13:49.193
What is this intrusion?

13:49.357 --> 13:52.357
I humbly apologize, most high lama, but...

13:52.525 --> 13:55.755
The monastery is closed. Now, go away.

13:56.141 --> 13:59.491
But look. Two strangers
have fallen from the sky.

14:04.815 --> 14:07.019
Indeed.

14:13.328 --> 14:16.940
May I offer you
something warm to drink?

14:17.201 --> 14:23.214
You must be very cold and tired
after your long journey, huh?

14:26.321 --> 14:28.209
Like, you had us at "warm."

14:38.739 --> 14:42.601
I see you do not enjoy
our yak-butter tea.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.861
Well, I'll say one thing.
You can really taste the yak.

14:49.781 --> 14:51.243
Do you mind if we use your phone?

14:51.413 --> 14:53.967
Our friends must think we've totally
flaked on them.

14:54.134 --> 14:57.233
Like, snow-flaked, that is.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.572
Oh, brother.

15:00.598 --> 15:04.144
I am sorry, but we have no such
modern conveniences here.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.827
Like, wherever here is.

15:27.610 --> 15:29.585
Yikes, Shaggy!

15:31.131 --> 15:33.913
Monster. Monster.

15:35.419 --> 15:37.274
That's no monster, Scooby-Doo.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.600
It's just some kind of creepy carving.

15:41.116 --> 15:44.793
You have discovered
our most sacred chamber.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.521
Like, way to go, Scoob.

15:46.685 --> 15:48.660
Why couldn't you discover
something useful...

15:48.828 --> 15:51.098
...like the refrigerator?

15:51.485 --> 15:53.525
Sorry.

15:54.014 --> 15:58.389
In this chamber,
we offer sacrifices to the yeti.

15:58.879 --> 16:01.083
Half man and half animal...

16:01.247 --> 16:05.077
...he lives in the snow caves,
high on the mountain.

16:05.535 --> 16:08.438
Like, there goes the neighborhood.

16:10.688 --> 16:13.405
What an extraordinary crystal.

16:13.568 --> 16:15.357
May I examine it...

16:15.520 --> 16:17.211
...closer?

16:18.529 --> 16:20.766
No, you may not.

16:23.874 --> 16:25.729
The crystal is sacred.

16:26.178 --> 16:29.888
Its mystical glow protects us
from the creature's evil power.

16:31.459 --> 16:33.663
- Evil power?
- Evil power?

16:38.948 --> 16:40.770
I have found you.

16:40.932 --> 16:44.445
Look out, Scoob.
It's that terrible tour guide.

16:49.381 --> 16:51.683
Do you know this man?

16:52.038 --> 16:56.316
Yeah. Like, thanks to him,
our grand tour took a grand detour.

16:56.486 --> 17:00.382
My sincerest apologies.
There was a terrible mishap.

17:00.550 --> 17:04.228
I was so worried, that I jumped
out of the plane myself...

17:04.391 --> 17:06.464
...desperate to save you.

17:06.823 --> 17:09.726
Speaking of desperate,
what about the rest of the gang?

17:09.896 --> 17:11.903
They must be worried sick about us.

17:12.359 --> 17:13.953
We're very popular, you know.

17:15.689 --> 17:19.486
I know. Why don't you try calling
your friends from the weather station?

17:20.040 --> 17:23.751
Weather station, eh?
Well, what are we waiting for?

17:24.329 --> 17:27.178
Like, hook us up
with that satellite hookup.

17:27.563 --> 17:29.603
It is a bit further up the mountain.

17:29.771 --> 17:31.331
I can take you there.

17:31.499 --> 17:34.980
The only place you are going
is down the mountain.

17:35.147 --> 17:37.569
I would be honored to guide you
to the weather station.

17:37.739 --> 17:38.852
I'll go too.

17:39.180 --> 17:42.694
With that snow creature out there,
we'll have greater strength in numbers.

17:44.173 --> 17:47.108
We will all climb the mountain together.

17:47.276 --> 17:49.382
Beware, gentlemen.

17:49.549 --> 17:52.451
The yeti is the watcher
of the guarded places...

17:52.622 --> 17:54.794
...a realm of terrible danger...

17:54.958 --> 18:00.076
...where those who seek the unknown
meet their doom.

18:06.576 --> 18:09.424
Like, whatever happened
to "bon voyage"?

18:09.584 --> 18:11.144
Yeah.

18:14.449 --> 18:16.816
Admit it, Freddie. We're lost.

18:16.977 --> 18:19.912
We're not lost.
We're just taking a shortcut.

18:20.401 --> 18:22.190
Across Mongolia?

18:22.353 --> 18:25.201
Just keep an eye out for road signs
to Timbuktu.

18:25.970 --> 18:30.641
So, Velma, what can you tell us
about this abdominal snowman?

18:30.803 --> 18:34.152
Not "abdominal," Freddie.
It's pronounced abominable.

18:40.276 --> 18:44.052
There are a number of different theories
regarding the abominable snowman.

18:44.213 --> 18:47.345
And there have been many photographs
taken of the yeti's footprints.

18:47.510 --> 18:51.056
Hold it. Back up. Yeti footprints?

18:51.222 --> 18:53.077
What on earth is a yeti?

18:53.238 --> 18:57.264
The yeti is the name used by the local
mountain people to describe the creature.

18:57.718 --> 19:01.745
So the yeti and the subliminal snowman
are the same thing?

19:02.551 --> 19:04.210
Not "subliminal," Fred.

19:08.472 --> 19:11.222
- Now you've got me all mixed up.
- I don't understand.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.970
What does any of this have to do
with Shaggy and Scooby?

19:14.137 --> 19:17.651
There's no mystery there, Freddie.
One thing we know for sure...

19:18.137 --> 19:21.366
...those two always know
how to find trouble.

19:43.517 --> 19:48.951
Scoob, old buddy, how did we ever wind up
on this frozen freak-fest?

19:49.406 --> 19:50.933
I don't know, Shaggy.

19:51.422 --> 19:55.351
Like, what I wouldn't give right now
for a nice warm Scooby Snack.

19:55.519 --> 19:57.755
Scooby Snacks?

19:57.918 --> 20:00.734
Well, why didn't you just say so?

20:06.304 --> 20:08.725
Oh, boy. Scooby Snacks.

20:08.896 --> 20:11.646
Yeah. A whole year's supply of them.

20:11.808 --> 20:15.999
Like, maybe this trip wasn't such a bad idea
after all, Scoob.

20:18.914 --> 20:23.999
Mountain climbing requires a lot of energy,
so we must eat many times a day.

20:24.514 --> 20:29.665
Gee, Scoob, this sounds like a sport
we could really sink our teeth into.

20:31.587 --> 20:34.937
Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff, Scoob.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.140
Yeah.

20:38.948 --> 20:40.257
How about you, professor?

20:40.420 --> 20:44.033
Like, got anything yummy
to add to our impromptu potluck?

20:45.445 --> 20:48.708
- Like, what is all this stuff?
- Don't touch that.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.941
I'm sorry. But this equipment
is very sensitive.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.306
We'd better keep moving.

21:00.167 --> 21:04.957
Gee whiz. His equipment's not
the only thing around here that's sensitive.

21:05.128 --> 21:07.811
Yeah, sensitive.

21:20.042 --> 21:21.122
Man, Scoob...

21:21.290 --> 21:25.600
...the air is so thin up here, like,
I think my lungs are gonna pop.

21:25.771 --> 21:28.641
Yeah, mine too.

21:29.195 --> 21:30.756
We must keep moving.

21:30.924 --> 21:34.219
The weather station is only a bit further.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.182
I think we're being followed.

21:42.989 --> 21:44.516
You see?

21:46.221 --> 21:50.532
What did I tell you, professor?
She is stubborn as a yak.

21:51.822 --> 21:56.230
I was going to leave the village, but then
I heard the weather report over the radio.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.556
There is a terrible snowstorm coming.
I only followed to warn you.

22:01.136 --> 22:02.924
You and that radio.

22:03.087 --> 22:05.935
Every day, all you do
is stare off into space...

22:06.096 --> 22:10.505
...listening to that jabber-mouthed
DJ playing his records.

22:10.673 --> 22:12.713
He's not a jabber-mouth.

22:12.881 --> 22:18.031
His beautiful voice is the only friend
I have on this lonely mountain.

22:18.193 --> 22:19.754
Here, just listen.

22:20.659 --> 22:22.568
And here's a cut from their last album...

22:22.738 --> 22:25.105
...recorded just before the band's
tragic breakup.

22:25.555 --> 22:27.792
The song went on to become
a one-hit wonder...

22:27.955 --> 22:32.625
...after its use in a popular Tv commercial
for furniture polish.

22:34.036 --> 22:35.924
Wow, like, who would've thought...

22:36.084 --> 22:38.735
...that you could get a radio station
way up here?

22:38.901 --> 22:40.014
You can't.

22:40.181 --> 22:45.232
It is just the man at the weather station
pretending to be a DJ.

22:46.133 --> 22:49.036
You have a crush on the weather man.

22:49.206 --> 22:52.556
And now you're tagging along
just for an excuse to meet him.

22:53.366 --> 22:56.749
That's not true. There is a storm coming.

22:56.919 --> 22:59.286
She is telling the truth. Look there.

23:03.864 --> 23:06.003
It could blow us right off this mountain.

23:06.168 --> 23:08.558
We've got to find shelter, and fast.

23:09.145 --> 23:10.639
We'll never make it.

23:10.809 --> 23:13.013
We're going to have to set up
our tents here.

23:14.681 --> 23:16.274
You mean, like, camping?

23:16.442 --> 23:20.403
Out here, with that psychotic snowman
on the loose?

23:20.794 --> 23:23.991
Scoob, old buddy, if there's one thing
I don't like about this plan...

23:24.155 --> 23:26.294
...it's everything about this plan.

23:26.459 --> 23:28.247
Yeah.

23:46.525 --> 23:49.144
Okay, Scoob.
Like, you've got first watch.

23:49.822 --> 23:52.954
If that big-footed bogeyman
shows his frozen face...

23:53.119 --> 23:57.014
...he'll have to deal with Scooby-Doo,
guard dog extraordinaire.

23:57.183 --> 23:59.223
Yeah. Guard dog.

23:59.392 --> 24:01.978
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

24:06.369 --> 24:09.784
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

24:09.953 --> 24:11.863
Hup, two, three, four.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.238
Like, Scoob, keep it down, will you?

24:14.402 --> 24:16.344
You wanna wake up
the whole neighborhood?

24:18.658 --> 24:20.251
Sorry.

24:27.875 --> 24:31.869
The creature. He knows we are here.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.873
Zoinks, and, like, he doesn't
sound too happy about it.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.760
Yeah.

24:43.525 --> 24:46.941
Mes amis, you cannot quit now.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.688
Sorry, like, Scoob and I
need our beauty sleep.

24:51.622 --> 24:53.117
Not to worry, mes amis.

24:53.287 --> 24:55.905
Come. I show you
something you like, eh?

24:59.368 --> 25:02.183
Like, it's a laser light show.

25:02.568 --> 25:05.535
You see? The traps, they are set.

25:05.704 --> 25:07.777
First I catch the monster...

25:07.945 --> 25:11.393
...then Shaggy and Scooby,
they will go home.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.504
- What?
- What?

25:14.026 --> 25:17.572
Like, I get it now. You're no tour guide.

25:17.738 --> 25:18.916
No, mon frere.

25:19.083 --> 25:24.680
I am Alphonse Lafleur,
the greatest hunter in all the world.

25:25.163 --> 25:29.571
And we're just monster bait
to help you catch that ice-cold cretin.

25:29.740 --> 25:32.457
Yeah. Monster bait.

25:41.293 --> 25:44.872
At last, the creature, he is here.

25:45.038 --> 25:49.261
And, like, we're gone, man. Real gone.

28:10.017 --> 28:11.643
What is going on out here?

28:11.810 --> 28:14.396
Like, you don't wanna know.

28:23.363 --> 28:24.541
No!

28:36.133 --> 28:40.443
Like, if I wasn't freezing,
I'd be having a major meltdown.

29:09.641 --> 29:14.149
Shaggy? Scooby? Is that really you?

29:16.843 --> 29:19.015
It's me, Del chillman.

29:19.179 --> 29:21.928
Wow, what are you guys doing up here?

29:22.667 --> 29:25.351
Would you believe it? We're on vacation.

29:25.516 --> 29:29.062
Yeah, vacation.

29:39.790 --> 29:44.712
So Shaggy and the poochie
have hitched a ride, eh?

29:44.879 --> 29:46.821
No matter.

29:47.535 --> 29:53.286
Where they go,
the monster is sure to follow.

30:15.282 --> 30:18.578
Well, sorry you can't call
the rest of the gang.

30:18.739 --> 30:22.035
It looks like the snowstorm
has blocked out the satellite.

30:23.604 --> 30:26.255
But, boy, am I glad to see you guys.

30:26.740 --> 30:28.715
I don't get too many visitors up here.

30:29.397 --> 30:32.496
Oh, boy, hot chocolate.

30:39.030 --> 30:40.306
The last time we saw you...

30:40.470 --> 30:43.220
...all you cared about was
the Loch Ness monster.

30:43.382 --> 30:44.724
Like, what happened?

30:45.975 --> 30:51.410
Nessie was a no-show.
I was so bummed. But then it hit me.

30:51.575 --> 30:54.391
What if I got a job up here
and used my free time...

30:54.552 --> 30:58.546
...to search for proof
of the abominable snowman?

31:03.353 --> 31:04.335
Hang on, guys.

31:07.929 --> 31:09.107
Hello, out there.

31:09.274 --> 31:12.570
Today's weather report:
A major snowstorm is blowing through...

31:12.730 --> 31:15.218
...with highs in the low minus 40s.

31:15.387 --> 31:20.723
You're chilling with Del chillman,
spinning music for your mountain morning.

31:24.444 --> 31:27.740
Wow, this is some groovy collection
you've got here.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.980
Yeah.

31:29.148 --> 31:32.596
So, like, your big assignment
is to be a radio disk jockey?

31:32.765 --> 31:35.154
Well, I'm only supposed to read
the weather report...

31:35.325 --> 31:37.976
...but it got lonely after a while.

31:38.141 --> 31:41.622
It helps to have someone to talk to,
even though nobody's really listening.

31:41.790 --> 31:44.125
Except for this. Check it out.

31:46.399 --> 31:47.708
Cool, huh?

31:47.871 --> 31:50.043
On you, it looks good.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.786
It just showed up one day,
along with this note. Listen.

31:53.952 --> 31:57.117
"Dear Del, I listen to your show
every day.

31:57.281 --> 32:00.281
I hope you never leave the mountain."

32:01.505 --> 32:06.208
Once I heard that, I knew
I just had to keep on rocking, man.

32:06.818 --> 32:08.793
I only wish I could stay longer.

32:09.474 --> 32:13.151
Like, "Signed, your number one fan."

32:13.922 --> 32:16.378
Hey, I've got an awesome idea.

32:16.547 --> 32:20.093
Why don't you guys
be the guest DJs on today's show?

32:20.643 --> 32:21.920
DJ?

32:22.084 --> 32:25.401
- Like, Scoob and me, as DJs?
- Sure.

32:25.572 --> 32:27.874
You two can stay here
and watch the station...

32:28.036 --> 32:30.972
...while I head out to search
for the other members of your party.

32:32.262 --> 32:35.557
Like, Scoob and I can just
keep the party going here.

32:35.718 --> 32:39.198
Yeah, yeah. Party.

32:39.366 --> 32:40.643
All right, then.

32:40.806 --> 32:43.708
Now, remember, that monster
is still out there somewhere.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.246
So while I'm gone, whatever you do...

32:46.760 --> 32:49.443
...do not open this door.

32:49.896 --> 32:51.838
Don't worry about us.

32:52.008 --> 32:56.165
The last thing we want is another run-in
with that winter-wonder weirdo.

33:18.763 --> 33:23.336
Wow, that sure was a long drive,
but we made great time.

33:23.596 --> 33:26.085
I can't even feel my legs anymore.

33:26.252 --> 33:28.391
Are you sure this is the right place,
Freddie?

33:28.556 --> 33:31.339
I think so, but I'm not sure.

33:31.501 --> 33:34.698
- My cell phone can't find a signal up here.
- Hey, wait.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.317
You can't just leave us here.

33:37.486 --> 33:40.902
No. This mountain is cursed.

33:41.071 --> 33:46.287
The yaks are unhappy,
for they feel the yeti's power.

33:46.447 --> 33:50.604
Come on, girls. We're going home.

33:52.208 --> 33:56.202
Okay. Deserted village, yeti's curse,
creepy yak guy.

33:56.849 --> 33:58.922
Yeah, we're in the right place.

34:01.554 --> 34:03.343
Hello?

34:04.497 --> 34:06.385
Anybody home?

34:07.634 --> 34:11.824
- Jeepers, this place gives me the creeps.
- Check it out.

34:13.395 --> 34:14.922
Scooby Snacks!

34:15.507 --> 34:19.817
And where there's Scooby Snacks,
Shaggy and Scooby won't be far away.

34:19.987 --> 34:21.898
Don't be so sure, Freddie.

34:22.356 --> 34:24.266
Come take a look.

34:25.076 --> 34:28.143
Hey, those look like
Shaggy and Scooby's tracks.

34:28.693 --> 34:31.726
But why would they be heading
up the mountain?

34:31.893 --> 34:34.708
I don't know, gang,
but I've got a hunch our next clue...

34:34.870 --> 34:37.936
...will be waiting for us in thin air.

34:57.785 --> 34:59.924
Like, greetings, radio listeners.

35:00.089 --> 35:03.472
Shaggy and Scooby, broadcasting live
from the top of the world...

35:03.642 --> 35:06.610
...spinning stacks of wax
for all you frostbitten fans out there.

35:06.778 --> 35:07.989
Right, Scoob?

35:16.667 --> 35:19.188
Hey, Scoob. You wanna hear
my radio voice?

35:19.356 --> 35:20.305
Yeah.

35:21.660 --> 35:24.977
Like, put down your snow shovel
and pick up that thin-air guitar.

35:25.148 --> 35:27.254
It's time to stay in and rock out.

35:52.992 --> 35:54.454
What happened here?

35:56.193 --> 35:57.502
Daphne, freeze.

35:58.497 --> 36:00.701
I'm way ahead of you, sister.

36:00.865 --> 36:03.833
No, freeze, as in, don't move.

36:04.130 --> 36:06.781
Jeepers. Giant footprints.

36:06.946 --> 36:09.914
They must belong
to the adorable snowman.

36:10.883 --> 36:12.028
Hold on, gang.

36:12.195 --> 36:15.359
There's something awfully strange
about these tracks.

36:15.523 --> 36:16.668
I'll say.

36:16.835 --> 36:20.065
This snowman must wear
a size-50 snowshoe.

36:20.228 --> 36:21.438
But look closer.

36:21.604 --> 36:23.841
The creature's footprint,
while larger in size...

36:24.005 --> 36:27.355
...only sinks half as deep into the snow
as Daphne's.

36:27.525 --> 36:29.151
But that doesn't make sense.

36:29.317 --> 36:32.001
How could I weigh more
than a snow monster?

36:32.166 --> 36:36.094
There's got to be
a reasonable explanation for this.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.086
Hey, gang, over here.

36:47.464 --> 36:49.766
And that is the last thing I remember.

36:50.248 --> 36:52.288
I don't know what happened
to the others.

36:52.649 --> 36:53.859
Don't worry, Pemba.

36:54.024 --> 36:58.051
By reading the footprints in the snow,
we should be able to reconstruct the attack.

36:58.666 --> 37:03.718
From the looks of these tracks, I'd say
Professor Jeffries snuck away on his own.

37:05.483 --> 37:09.891
But why go climbing by himself at night,
in the middle of a snowstorm?

37:10.346 --> 37:13.893
What about Minga?
I do not see her footprints anywhere.

37:14.763 --> 37:17.579
It's like she just vanished.

37:17.996 --> 37:22.252
Well, gang, it looks like
we've got a mystery on our hands.

37:23.596 --> 37:25.768
Jinkies, look.

37:26.253 --> 37:28.196
It's a radio.

37:29.294 --> 37:32.523
That's Minga's. She never
goes anywhere without it.

37:33.006 --> 37:37.644
Then she must've dropped it
as the creature carried her away.

37:37.807 --> 37:42.444
You mean, Minga has been kidnapped
by the abominable snowman?

37:42.607 --> 37:45.095
Oh, this is all my fault.

37:45.264 --> 37:48.047
I should never have returned
to the mountain.

37:48.208 --> 37:52.137
And what about Shaggy and Scooby?
They must still be out there somewhere.

37:52.592 --> 37:56.335
Oh, Scooby-Doo. Where are you?

38:01.938 --> 38:04.524
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.566
Like, that's right, old buddy.

38:07.731 --> 38:11.408
It's Scooby and Shaggy.
They're on the radio.

38:11.892 --> 38:13.899
And now, for all you
mountain music lovers...

38:14.068 --> 38:16.457
...it's time for your
mid-morning traffic report.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.498
There's a six-yak pileup
on the Tibetan tri-level...

38:19.669 --> 38:22.768
...got you backed up all the way
to the K2 off-ramp.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.104
So if you're traveling by yak
this morning...

38:25.269 --> 38:28.401
...try to give yourself
an extra day or two, folks.

38:32.630 --> 38:35.892
What is it, Scoob?
Can't you see I'm broadcasting here?

38:39.735 --> 38:44.013
Hey, you're right.
Like, I forgot to check the temperature.

38:44.312 --> 38:46.221
Oh, better wear
your mittens today, folks.

38:46.392 --> 38:49.840
It's a chilly 15 degrees below zero
out there.

38:53.881 --> 38:57.624
And, like, with a hundred-percent chance
of snow monsters!

38:59.066 --> 39:00.113
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:00.282 --> 39:03.446
...we interrupt our scheduled program
to bring you this special report.

39:03.610 --> 39:05.618
Like, live, as it happens.

39:07.547 --> 39:10.613
Hang on, folks. I've just been handed
this important bulletin:

39:11.899 --> 39:13.722
Like, "Help!"

39:44.640 --> 39:47.258
Table for one, monsieur?

39:48.897 --> 39:50.871
Like, your menu, sir.

40:18.532 --> 40:21.980
Okay, Scoob, hit him
with the old one-two.

40:22.149 --> 40:24.222
Yeah, one-two.

40:24.390 --> 40:27.292
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

40:34.087 --> 40:35.167
Come on, champ.

40:35.335 --> 40:39.045
Give him the old double, backwards,
super-duper Scooby spin.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.244
We're trapped, Scooby-Doo.

41:17.164 --> 41:19.979
- Help!
- Help!

41:22.445 --> 41:24.867
Jinkies, we've lost them.

41:25.037 --> 41:27.623
We've got to get
to that weather station, and fast.

41:28.238 --> 41:31.719
It is not far. You will see it
just over that ridge.

41:32.239 --> 41:34.027
I am going to search for Minga...

41:34.895 --> 41:37.131
...in the monster's cave.

41:37.519 --> 41:39.723
Pemba's right. We should split up.

41:39.888 --> 41:43.052
Daphne, you and I will head over
to the weather station.

41:43.216 --> 41:45.934
No, thanks, Freddie.
I'm going with Pemba.

41:46.097 --> 41:47.624
Okay, that's...

41:48.657 --> 41:50.959
You can pair up with Velma this time.

41:51.729 --> 41:53.584
Lucky me.

41:54.642 --> 41:55.820
All right, gang.

41:55.986 --> 42:00.623
Let's solve this mystery before Shaggy
and Scooby wind up in the deep freeze.

42:12.404 --> 42:15.055
You think you can outsmart...

42:15.220 --> 42:19.050
...Alphonse Lafleur, eh, beastie?

42:20.629 --> 42:22.484
Like, what took you so long?

42:22.645 --> 42:26.257
A couple of more seconds and we
would've been abominable appetizers.

42:26.422 --> 42:27.535
Yeah.

42:27.702 --> 42:32.623
What did I tell you, huh?
You must think like the creature, no?

42:36.151 --> 42:40.243
Okay, maybe not so much thinking
next time.

42:46.008 --> 42:48.343
You come for Lafleur, eh?

42:48.505 --> 42:53.525
No, no, no.
Lafleur has come for you.

42:58.906 --> 42:59.855
Oh, no.

43:08.987 --> 43:12.533
Monsieur Lafleur, he's gone.

43:14.044 --> 43:17.012
Zoinks, like, lucky him.

43:37.664 --> 43:38.776
Shaggy.

43:54.946 --> 43:58.176
Hang on, Scoob. I'm hitching a ride.

44:06.436 --> 44:07.865
We made it.

44:08.036 --> 44:11.332
Scoob, old buddy,
point this balloon toward coolsville...

44:11.492 --> 44:13.980
...and let's go home.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.700
Okay.

44:16.869 --> 44:20.066
There's the weather station,
directly across the valley.

44:20.934 --> 44:22.210
Listen, Freddie.

44:22.374 --> 44:24.283
Do you hear that?

44:29.094 --> 44:32.739
- Fred? Velma?
- Del?

44:33.191 --> 44:35.777
Man, I thought you guys were in Paris.

44:36.200 --> 44:39.102
You've got to be kidding me.

44:41.320 --> 44:45.860
I asked them to fill in for me on the radio
while I went out to look for the others.

44:46.025 --> 44:50.433
Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby were here,
with more monster than they could handle.

44:50.698 --> 44:53.186
Maybe there was something else
the snowman was after...

44:53.354 --> 44:55.077
...besides Shaggy and Scooby.

44:55.658 --> 44:59.455
According to these inventory records,
a few of your helium tanks are missing.

44:59.819 --> 45:02.688
- My what?
- Helium tanks?

45:02.859 --> 45:06.155
Yeah, we use helium to fill up
the weather balloons, but...

45:06.316 --> 45:07.723
They're missing?

45:07.884 --> 45:12.391
What would a snow creature want
with pressurized helium?

45:13.869 --> 45:15.941
Take a look at this.

45:16.109 --> 45:18.695
This is so weird.

45:19.373 --> 45:21.577
That looks like a seismograph.

45:21.998 --> 45:24.747
A device used
to detect underground vibrations.

45:25.550 --> 45:26.979
I knew that.

45:28.047 --> 45:32.358
And it's picking up some really strange
vibes deep inside the mountain.

45:32.879 --> 45:36.109
Then maybe the next place to search
for clues won't be on the mountain...

45:36.272 --> 45:37.799
...but in it.

45:40.816 --> 45:42.573
Hello?

45:42.737 --> 45:44.941
Anybody home?

45:45.105 --> 45:48.684
Minga, are you in here?

45:51.314 --> 45:53.900
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine...

45:54.066 --> 45:56.750
...but I think I just stubbed my toe
on a clue.

45:58.035 --> 45:59.245
Helium? How strange.

45:59.411 --> 46:02.510
And look, the gauge is on empty.

46:02.995 --> 46:05.167
I'm starting to think
this abominable snowman...

46:05.332 --> 46:09.227
...may be less snow and more man.

46:12.661 --> 46:17.396
Okay, Scooby-Doo, you got us up here.
Now, like, how are we gonna get down?

46:32.439 --> 46:34.000
Like, don't look now, Scoob...

46:34.168 --> 46:38.391
...but I think our stock
is about to take a serious plunge.

46:58.395 --> 47:00.697
Well, what do you know?

47:00.859 --> 47:03.478
That wasn't so bad after all.

47:07.388 --> 47:10.967
Do not be afraid, my young travelers.

47:11.869 --> 47:15.993
Zoinks, like, who's afraid?

47:16.382 --> 47:18.040
I am.

47:20.446 --> 47:21.755
I am wondering.

47:21.918 --> 47:25.715
What are you doing
among the gravestones of the spirits?

47:27.871 --> 47:29.976
- Gravestones?
- Gravestones?

47:37.600 --> 47:39.902
Fear not, honored ones.

47:40.065 --> 47:43.578
Your good karma has at last
brought you to safety.

47:45.186 --> 47:49.529
Welcome to the lost kingdom
of Shangri-la.

48:03.651 --> 48:07.613
Wow, the vibes in this place
are too groovy for words.

48:07.781 --> 48:10.781
And, like, it's done wonders
for your complexion.

48:10.949 --> 48:13.022
For thousands of years...

48:13.189 --> 48:17.445
...this mystical valley
has been the source of eternal youth.

48:17.606 --> 48:21.119
Those who discover Shangri-la
can never grow old...

48:21.286 --> 48:23.904
...so long as they stay.

48:30.216 --> 48:33.250
Like, what is it now, Scooby-Doo?

48:33.704 --> 48:36.225
He pulled my tail. Pulled tail.

48:36.392 --> 48:39.294
Like, you say somebody pulled your tail?

48:45.066 --> 48:48.863
Hey, like, those chimps must think
we're a couple of chumps.

48:49.034 --> 48:51.041
Oh, yeah?

48:58.475 --> 49:02.218
Like, nobody makes a monkey out of you,
right, Scooby-Doo?

49:09.132 --> 49:12.231
Apparently, I spoke too soon.

49:12.941 --> 49:14.796
Indeed.

49:15.630 --> 49:17.255
This way, my friends.

49:17.421 --> 49:20.935
You may stay as long as you wish.

49:21.807 --> 49:25.255
You know, Scoob, I could
get used to a place like this.

49:25.423 --> 49:28.358
Yeah, me too.

49:40.305 --> 49:42.378
According to the data
from the seismograph...

49:42.545 --> 49:45.196
...this should be the right spot.

49:56.339 --> 49:57.517
Jinkies.

49:57.684 --> 50:01.645
The underground vibrations
must be coming from down there.

50:02.612 --> 50:03.757
Come on, gang.

50:04.276 --> 50:07.375
It's time to put this mystery on ice.

50:13.461 --> 50:17.652
Boy, Scoob, that High Lama
sure seemed like an awfully wise man.

50:17.814 --> 50:19.854
But, like, you'd think,
he'd have remembered...

50:20.023 --> 50:21.932
...to tell us where to brush our teeth.

50:23.095 --> 50:27.951
Gee, for such a peaceful people,
they sure had a lot of creepy paintings.

50:28.119 --> 50:30.705
Yeah, creepy.

50:32.184 --> 50:34.606
Check this guy out, Scoob.

50:34.777 --> 50:37.494
Like, he must be the god of bad breath.

50:49.818 --> 50:51.029
And who's this?

50:51.195 --> 50:53.813
Like, talk about a bad hair day.

50:53.979 --> 50:56.849
Somebody paint this guy a hat.

51:01.948 --> 51:04.632
Now, this guy's
the ugliest one of them all.

51:09.021 --> 51:10.330
You're not kidding, Scoob.

51:10.493 --> 51:12.730
Like, who'd be his date for the prom?

51:12.893 --> 51:14.868
Tyrannosaurus rex?

51:16.606 --> 51:17.915
Shaggy...

51:18.206 --> 51:22.549
I mean, with a face like that,
he could go as himself for Halloween.

51:24.319 --> 51:28.575
Like, he's so ugly, he probably
has to sneak up on himself in the mirror.

51:31.232 --> 51:33.653
Zoinks, it's the abominable snowman!

51:33.824 --> 51:36.410
And, like, I don't think
he appreciates my honesty.

51:48.355 --> 51:52.152
We gotta find someplace to hide
from that bipolar polar bear.

52:17.254 --> 52:21.346
Like, check it out.
This tunnel's got a split personality.

52:22.151 --> 52:25.250
Shaggy? Scooby? Is that you?

52:25.415 --> 52:27.455
Guys, it is you.

52:27.752 --> 52:30.119
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.833
And, like, Shaggy too.

52:40.810 --> 52:43.974
Don't even think about it.

52:45.962 --> 52:49.476
Hey, guys. So, what happened up there?

52:50.826 --> 52:53.161
More like, what's happening down here?

52:53.323 --> 52:55.178
Jeepers.

52:56.075 --> 52:58.115
Was that an explosion?

52:58.284 --> 53:01.154
Check it out.
Like, where did you guys come from?

53:01.325 --> 53:04.042
I'd love to catch up,
but we can't stay here.

53:04.205 --> 53:06.693
This cave could collapse at any moment.

53:16.398 --> 53:18.220
Jeepers.

53:19.951 --> 53:22.766
It's some kind of crystal cavern.

53:22.927 --> 53:26.539
Now, this is what I call
an underground scene.

53:27.984 --> 53:30.766
Look. There's somebody down there.

53:30.928 --> 53:32.489
It's Professor Jeffries.

53:43.922 --> 53:46.770
Fire in the hole. So I did.

53:54.643 --> 53:57.807
Oh, Professor Jeffries, you are brilliant.

53:57.972 --> 54:00.787
Simply, marvelously brilliant.

54:01.364 --> 54:02.542
Come on, gang.

54:02.709 --> 54:06.735
I've got a plan to catch
this crystal-craving creep.

54:10.198 --> 54:12.108
Once I get down
this desolate mountain...

54:12.278 --> 54:16.589
...it'll be nothing but room service
and warm, sunny beaches.

54:16.759 --> 54:17.936
The crystal!

54:18.646 --> 54:21.036
Like, looking for this?

54:23.703 --> 54:25.940
Come back here with that crystal.

54:26.104 --> 54:27.478
Finders keepers.

54:28.504 --> 54:30.359
And, like, losers snoozers.

54:30.521 --> 54:32.976
Mush, Scoob. Mush. Mush.

54:33.145 --> 54:34.803
Hit it!

54:41.050 --> 54:44.978
A textbook example of how to catch
a would-be snow monster.

54:45.371 --> 54:49.878
What? No, you've got it all wrong.
I'm not the snowman.

54:50.171 --> 54:52.026
It all makes perfect sense.

54:52.187 --> 54:55.570
Professor Jeffries has been using
the legend of the abominable snowman...

54:55.739 --> 54:57.627
...to scare everyone off the mountain.

54:57.788 --> 55:01.498
I hate to interrupt, but it looks like
there's still a few scares left...

55:01.660 --> 55:03.483
...to this snow-monster mystery.

55:09.726 --> 55:12.443
Come on, gang, we gotta skedaddle.

55:18.975 --> 55:21.561
All aboard the Snowman Express.

55:25.952 --> 55:28.767
You're not out of this race yet,
Jeffries, old boy.

56:06.309 --> 56:09.310
The crystal is mine!

56:27.336 --> 56:31.014
The lost treasure of Shangri-la
is lost no more.

56:31.177 --> 56:32.966
You can have it. And, like, what a deal.

56:33.129 --> 56:35.813
It comes with a matching snowman.

57:06.862 --> 57:10.310
This is going to hurt!

57:15.918 --> 57:18.472
I was right. That hurt.

57:18.640 --> 57:21.706
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

57:21.872 --> 57:24.076
What about Shaggy and Scooby?

57:24.432 --> 57:27.050
They must still be inside
the mountain somewhere.

57:28.048 --> 57:31.529
Okay, gang. I've got a plan to catch
this freezer-burned bogeyman.

57:31.697 --> 57:36.007
But we'll have to work fast.
Come on. Del, you are driving.

57:36.178 --> 57:37.585
Right on.

57:40.658 --> 57:43.975
Jeffries, old boy,
nothing can stop us now.

57:44.147 --> 57:46.034
Hey, professor.

57:46.483 --> 57:50.346
Don't look now, but I think
you're about to get schooled.

58:06.870 --> 58:08.779
Like, I can't see a thing, Scoob.

58:08.950 --> 58:11.055
How about lighting one of those candles?

58:13.815 --> 58:16.117
Zoinks, like, that's no candle.

58:16.279 --> 58:18.418
It's a stick of dynamite!

58:18.903 --> 58:20.976
Dynamite.

58:34.713 --> 58:37.845
We made it, Scoob. We're alive.

58:53.148 --> 58:56.661
Whatever you're doing, Scoob,
like, do it faster.

59:01.533 --> 59:03.508
Like, far out.

59:04.317 --> 59:05.626
Come on, Scoob.

59:05.789 --> 59:08.921
Like, let's shred this mountain
before it shreds us.

59:21.024 --> 59:23.741
Way to go, Scoob. Way to go.

59:23.904 --> 59:26.872
Like, who knew you were such a hot dog?

59:27.041 --> 59:29.212
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

59:37.986 --> 59:41.118
Hate to be a back-seat boarder,
but, like, what happens...

59:41.283 --> 59:42.712
...when we run out of mountain?

59:49.443 --> 59:51.833
Okay, I think that should do it.

59:52.100 --> 59:57.633
Man, when they hit this baby,
it's gonna be sweet.

01:00:04.005 --> 01:00:06.723
Way to go, guys.
The slope looks perfect.

01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:10.748
Once they hit this last ramp,
they'll catch air over the monastery wall...

01:00:10.918 --> 01:00:14.399
...boosting right into the trap we made
from the climbing ropes.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:17.606
And not a minute too soon.
Here they come.

01:00:22.024 --> 01:00:24.414
It's Shaggy and Scooby.

01:00:25.416 --> 01:00:27.304
They're headed right for the trap.

01:00:56.269 --> 01:00:59.400
Man, Scoob, that was one epic ride.

01:00:59.565 --> 01:01:01.867
Yeah, epic.

01:01:08.815 --> 01:01:13.223
Sorry, old chum, but this mountain is just
not big enough for the both of us.

01:01:30.129 --> 01:01:32.170
Extraordinary.

01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:35.464
Yeah, man. It worked!

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.020
Del?

01:01:46.164 --> 01:01:48.019
Hang on, Velma.

01:01:48.724 --> 01:01:50.098
Oh, I'm hanging.

01:02:01.302 --> 01:02:03.058
They're not gonna make it.

01:02:18.584 --> 01:02:22.163
Del! Jinkies!

01:02:41.115 --> 01:02:42.457
Look.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.610
A flying abominable snowman?

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.821
My mind is blown.

01:02:52.988 --> 01:02:55.410
That's no snowman.

01:03:07.294 --> 01:03:09.750
Try snow-woman.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.263
Minga.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:20.350
Minga Sherpa has been
behind this monster mystery...

01:03:20.513 --> 01:03:22.586
...from the very beginning.

01:03:22.848 --> 01:03:25.183
She used the helium tanks
from the weather station...

01:03:25.345 --> 01:03:27.287
...to fill her monster costume.

01:03:27.457 --> 01:03:30.621
That's how the yeti was able
to climb so easily.

01:03:31.138 --> 01:03:33.243
And that's also why
the monster's footprints...

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:36.225
...didn't sink very deeply into the snow.

01:03:37.379 --> 01:03:40.762
I'm very sorry.
I never meant to hurt anyone.

01:03:40.931 --> 01:03:44.379
But I don't understand.
Why did you do it?

01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:48.798
All I really wanted was to listen
to Del chillman on the radio.

01:03:48.964 --> 01:03:52.445
You see, I am your number one fan.

01:03:53.189 --> 01:03:54.367
Really?

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:57.604
When I learned that you were going
to be leaving the mountain...

01:03:57.765 --> 01:04:01.246
...I brought the yeti to life
as a way of keeping you here.

01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:05.343
So, like, that's why she's trying
so hard to scare us all.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:08.445
She just wanted to convince Del
to stick around.

01:04:08.999 --> 01:04:12.098
Wow, that's so...

01:04:12.263 --> 01:04:16.387
I mean, it's real cool, mama.

01:04:19.688 --> 01:04:21.215
As for Professor Jeffries...

01:04:21.385 --> 01:04:24.352
...he was just using the legend of the yeti
to cover up his scheme.

01:04:24.842 --> 01:04:28.420
And I would've gotten away with it, too,
if it weren't for you meddling kids...

01:04:28.585 --> 01:04:31.553
...and that mountain-climbing mutt,
Scooby-Doo.

01:04:32.362 --> 01:04:34.435
Who, me?

01:04:34.922 --> 01:04:38.818
So, like, is the abominable snowman
just a myth after all?

01:04:38.987 --> 01:04:40.678
No, mes amis.

01:04:42.156 --> 01:04:44.360
- Alphonse Lafleur?
- Alphonse Lafleur?

01:04:45.036 --> 01:04:47.720
The abominable snowman is real.

01:04:48.268 --> 01:04:50.919
Like, you're alive?

01:04:51.245 --> 01:04:55.271
Amazingly, I survived my terrible fall...

01:04:55.437 --> 01:04:57.826
...from the high cliff.

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:01.543
As I lay unconscious in the snow...

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:06.021
...something rescued me.

01:05:08.719 --> 01:05:11.021
The next thing I know, I found myself...

01:05:11.183 --> 01:05:15.013
...out on the mountain, all alone.

01:05:18.256 --> 01:05:21.605
I can remember nothing else.

01:05:21.777 --> 01:05:25.640
Zoinks, like, I think,
you remembered plenty.

01:05:27.442 --> 01:05:30.606
So there really is
an abominable snowman?

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:31.915
Right on.

01:05:32.851 --> 01:05:35.786
Sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

01:05:36.115 --> 01:05:39.628
Gee, Minga,
what you did is so romantic...

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:43.091
...in a kind of twisted way, which I like.

01:05:43.252 --> 01:05:46.252
I'm just not sure where we go from here.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.525
I've got an idea.

01:06:00.694 --> 01:06:03.859
Oh, I am loving the Paris.

01:06:04.023 --> 01:06:05.201
Like, us too.

01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:08.498
They say Paris is for lovers, right, Scoob?

01:06:08.663 --> 01:06:11.762
Well, I'm in love
with this springtime spread.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.837
Oui, oui, Shaggy.

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:26.994
Where's Freddie? He was supposed
to meet us here an hour ago.

01:06:28.538 --> 01:06:32.084
Can you believe it, Scoob?
My ears are ringing again.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:34.487
It's your phone.

01:06:35.035 --> 01:06:36.212
Like, hello.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.431
Guys? I think I got on the wrong plane.

01:06:44.636 --> 01:06:46.643
Here we go again.

01:06:47.229 --> 01:06:48.920
Now where?

01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:54.013
Like, step on it, Scoob.
Next stop, the Amazon jungle.

01:06:57.438 --> 01:07:03.068
Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
