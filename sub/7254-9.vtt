00:00.206 --> 00:03.787
So, Lorelai couldn't have been more
than, what, 8 or 10 years old?

00:03.797 --> 00:05.635
But she was very definite
about the whole thing.

00:05.665 --> 00:08.624
She looked me directly in the eye,
and she said,

00:08.634 --> 00:11.802
"When I grow up,
I'm going to marry Tip O'Neill."

00:12.303 --> 00:15.278
I swear to you,
I nearly had a heart attack.

00:15.288 --> 00:18.356
I liked the name "Tip." I thought it
was cute, like a puppy or a bunny.

00:18.366 --> 00:21.168
Anyway, I'm happy that
you two got married,

00:21.178 --> 00:25.169
and quite relieved not to have
had Tip O'Neill as a son-in-law.

00:25.179 --> 00:26.867
Here's to your marriage --

00:26.877 --> 00:30.340
our heartfelt congratulations.
We also got you a little gift.

00:30.453 --> 00:33.341
Oh, yes,
which is crying out to be opened.

00:33.357 --> 00:35.803
It's just a little token to
commemorate the occasion.

00:35.819 --> 00:37.192
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:37.209 --> 00:39.081
I love the look of
this wrapping paper.

00:39.095 --> 00:41.211
- To the happy couple...
- Oh, well, not the time.

00:41.228 --> 00:44.062
- ...to Lorelai and Christopher.
- Hear, hear!

00:44.076 --> 00:45.630
To Lorelai and Christopher.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.883
Long may they live.
Okay, time to open?

00:47.895 --> 00:49.583
Yes, Lorelai,
you may open your present.

00:49.598 --> 00:52.310
For heaven's sake,
you're like a dolphin at feeding time.

01:00.235 --> 01:01.491
Wow.

01:01.508 --> 01:03.582
I mean, d--

01:03.595 --> 01:06.070
I -- it's -- it's like, "wow."

01:06.085 --> 01:08.063
It's an etching by Kiki Smith.

01:08.076 --> 01:10.202
It's extraordinary, this item.

01:10.215 --> 01:11.260
- Wow.
- Wow, right?

01:11.276 --> 01:12.480
It's called "Wolf Girl."

01:12.498 --> 01:15.032
Baldwin, our dealer,
is a big fan of Kiki Smith.

01:15.046 --> 01:16.663
She's all the rage in New York.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.410
That was very generous of you.

01:18.428 --> 01:19.520
It's our pleasure.

01:19.535 --> 01:21.631
All couples should
cultivate an art collection.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.241
Well, this is gonna start
our collection off...

01:24.417 --> 01:25.951
with a bang.

01:25.967 --> 01:29.590
I'm so happy you love it. We were
flying blind without a gift registry.

01:29.607 --> 01:31.033
Well, you flew great, mom.

01:31.048 --> 01:33.473
Of course, I imagine it's
difficult to have the forethought

01:33.486 --> 01:36.411
to register when you
decide to suddenly elope.

01:36.425 --> 01:39.163
Everything changes when a couple elopes,
doesn't it?

01:39.175 --> 01:41.692
Nothing is done in quite
the traditional manner --

01:41.708 --> 01:44.012
for instance,
informing your parents of your marriage

01:44.028 --> 01:46.430
by leaving them a message
on their answering machine.

01:46.448 --> 01:48.960
What? You told me
you told them.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.650
I didn't say they were
home when I told them.

01:50.687 --> 01:52.243
Mom, you're such a chicken.

01:52.255 --> 01:54.380
You left a message
on their machine?

01:54.396 --> 01:56.211
She certainly did.

01:56.227 --> 01:59.763
I come home, and I push "play" on
the machine, and what do I hear

01:59.777 --> 02:01.642
between a message
from Lily Margulies

02:01.655 --> 02:04.010
about her fund-raiser
for tanzanian children

02:04.025 --> 02:05.643
and one from my tennis pro,

02:05.658 --> 02:08.102
but my very own
daughter telling me,

02:08.116 --> 02:09.890
guess what -- she's married.

02:09.907 --> 02:12.511
- Mom, I'm sorry. I just --
- Why just talk about it?

02:12.526 --> 02:14.772
- Why not share it?
- No, no! Hey, hey!

02:14.785 --> 02:18.272
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

02:18.288 --> 02:19.970
G.G.'s all set.

02:19.986 --> 02:23.611
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married.

02:23.626 --> 02:26.101
So, anyway,
see you friday. Bye!

02:26.117 --> 02:27.411
Isn't that lovely?

02:27.426 --> 02:29.102
Mom, erase that, please.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.823
I most certainly will not.

02:30.838 --> 02:33.301
Your father and I plan
to treasure it forever.

02:33.317 --> 02:36.401
We're going to have it as
a keepsake or a memento.

02:36.506 --> 02:39.211
"Remember when Lorelai
told us she was married?"

02:39.225 --> 02:42.281
"Ah, yes, and what was 
it exactly that she said?"

02:42.296 --> 02:45.132
"I think it was
something like this."

02:45.145 --> 02:48.681
Hey, just wanted you guys to know,
Christopher and I are back from Paris.

02:48.696 --> 02:50.473
G.G.'s all set.

02:50.486 --> 02:54.871
And, uh, we just ended up, uh...
getting married. So, anyway--

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:49.995 --> 03:51.713
The lamb is delicious, Emily.

03:51.726 --> 03:54.413
Who's being Mr. "Favorite 
son-in-law happy smile face"?

03:54.428 --> 03:55.950
I'm glad you're enjoying
it, Christopher.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.812
My butcher had it flown
in from New Zealand.

03:57.825 --> 03:59.891
- First class, I hope.
- Well, the dinner is very nice.

03:59.927 --> 04:00.572
It is.

04:00.585 --> 04:02.502
It ought to be.
We have cause to celebrate.

04:02.516 --> 04:04.763
Yes, we do.
Speaking of which, we have decided

04:04.776 --> 04:07.160
that  we would like to throw
you two a wedding party.

04:07.178 --> 04:09.042
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Very sweet.

04:09.055 --> 04:11.630
Very sweet, mom, but you know what --
it's totally unnecessary.

04:11.645 --> 04:15.051
Look, you already gave us
"Wolf Girl," which, I mean, ah?

04:15.066 --> 04:16.791
- How do you top that?
- We insist.

04:16.808 --> 04:18.791
Dad, we're already married.
Isn't it too late?

04:18.808 --> 04:21.281
No, but soon it will be.
We need to get on this right away.

04:21.297 --> 04:23.881
We don't want it to look as if there's
anything to be ashamed of here.

04:23.917 --> 04:26.470
If we don't throw a party,
who knows what people will think?

04:26.485 --> 04:28.460
Why don't you give us
an anniversary party?

04:28.475 --> 04:30.442
Like a 10th?
Wouldn't that be nice, honey?

04:30.457 --> 04:33.861
I mean, what is 10 --
bronze, sandstone, particleboard?

04:33.875 --> 04:35.070
Actually, it's tin.

04:35.087 --> 04:36.392
But that's not for 10 years.

04:36.407 --> 04:38.243
Giving you plenty of
time to plan. Tin?

04:38.257 --> 04:39.381
Things just stick in my brain.

04:39.418 --> 04:41.462
Lorelai, you ought to
celebrate your marriage.

04:41.475 --> 04:44.001
We did. We did celebrate --
right after we got married,

04:44.015 --> 04:46.510
we went out and had a beautiful meal,
didn't we?

04:46.525 --> 04:47.762
We had a beautiful meal.

04:47.776 --> 04:51.462
Yeah, we had a chocolate mousse and
a para liqueur and a cheese plate.

04:51.478 --> 04:52.603
A cheese plate?

04:52.617 --> 04:54.892
Since when is a hunk of
fermented milk a suitable means

04:54.907 --> 04:56.980
- for celebrating a marriage?
- Look mom, we're good.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.302
- Honestly, we're celebrated out.
- But what about us?

04:59.316 --> 05:01.610
Hey, if you and dad want a party,
it's fine by me.

05:01.628 --> 05:04.333
Buy some 40s, rent an inflatable
bounce house. That's great.

05:04.348 --> 05:05.930
- Knock yourselves out.
- What about Rory?

05:05.967 --> 05:06.963
What about Rory?

05:06.975 --> 05:10.422
Rory, now tell me, don't you think this
marriage should be officially celebrated?

05:10.438 --> 05:13.342
Well... yes, actually.

05:13.357 --> 05:14.701
I think it would be nice.

05:14.718 --> 05:15.662
Christopher?

05:15.675 --> 05:17.521
Well, I think it would be fun.

05:17.535 --> 05:19.612
I'm not one to turn
down a free cocktail.

05:19.627 --> 05:21.242
Lorelai?

05:22.217 --> 05:26.113
Okay, then, let's celebrate.
Let's have a party.

05:26.125 --> 05:26.920
Wonderful.

05:26.937 --> 05:29.990
Now, if we book the Harbor Club,
we can't have more than 400.

05:30.005 --> 05:33.341
So Lorelai, I'll need a list of your
people as soon as it's earthly possible --

05:33.356 --> 05:34.211
you too, Christopher.

05:34.225 --> 05:36.701
Well, I can give you my list right now.
It's me, Chris, Rory,

05:36.717 --> 05:38.172
Logan -- 
if Rory wants him there --

05:38.187 --> 05:39.663
Sookie, Jackson, and Michel.

05:39.678 --> 05:40.440
That's it?

05:40.456 --> 05:42.790
You can invite more people than that.
It's your day.

05:42.806 --> 05:43.653
That's my list.

05:43.668 --> 05:46.691
Why don't you invite some of your
charming Stars Hollow friends?

05:46.708 --> 05:47.943
That's  okay, mom.

05:47.956 --> 05:50.560
We can make it black-tie optional,
if that will help.

05:50.576 --> 05:52.540
It's not because they
don't have black ties.

05:52.556 --> 05:54.763
Suit yourself.
Now, what do you think --

05:54.775 --> 05:58.053
a  string quartet, or something more fun,
like a swing band?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.872
My god, woman,
is there a book you don't own?

06:02.888 --> 06:04.313
I'm so sorry.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.551
I think I may have
re-activated my scoliosis.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.181
Suck it up, people.
That was the last of it.

06:08.216 --> 06:09.371
So much for one trip, huh?

06:09.385 --> 06:11.371
Well, who knew I had nine
trips' worth of stuff?

06:11.386 --> 06:15.112
Your place is so big, it made my
stuff look small and inconsequential.

06:15.128 --> 06:16.633
Did I mention I'm so sorry?

06:16.646 --> 06:18.122
Two copies of "The
Norton Anthology"?

06:18.126 --> 06:20.182
They were gifts.
I can't get rid of gifts.

06:20.197 --> 06:22.821
Okay, looks like all that's left
to do now is the paperwork.

06:22.837 --> 06:24.370
- Paperwork?
- The lease.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.631
- You want me to sign a lease?
- Well you are subletting from me and

06:26.647 --> 06:28.813
the last time you lived here, you just
up and left in the middle of the year.

06:28.849 --> 06:30.432
Um, you kicked me out.

06:30.449 --> 06:32.623
You moved all my stuff out in
the hallway and locked the door.

06:32.657 --> 06:34.370
Well, now you'll have a
legally binding contract

06:34.405 --> 06:36.683
that will negate my ability
to do that in the future.

06:36.838 --> 06:38.373
All right. What does it say?

06:38.386 --> 06:41.592
Standard boiler-plate stuff --
just sign here and here.

06:43.525 --> 06:46.551
And initial here and here.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.050
Okay. What is this?

06:48.066 --> 06:51.182
"Rights and privileges of Logan
Huntzberger or any other paramours"?

06:51.198 --> 06:53.712
If Logan is going to be
spending an enormous amount of time here,

06:53.727 --> 06:56.632
it's only fair to assess a daily
tariff for water and power use.

06:56.646 --> 06:58.502
- Paris!
- It's a very simple formula,

06:58.518 --> 07:00.671
based on the number of nights he
spends per month at the apartment,

07:00.705 --> 07:03.532
times the approximate minutes per day he
spends showering, brushing his teeth,

07:03.565 --> 07:06.362
and/or surfing the internet.
And sunday is no charge.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.952
It's okay. I'll kick in, Paris.

07:07.966 --> 07:09.671
Thataboy, Rockefeller.

07:09.688 --> 07:10.982
- All right.
- Okay.

07:10.996 --> 07:12.550
- Welcome back to the hood.
- Thanks.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.692
- It's good to have you back, Rory.
- Oh, thanks, Doyle.

07:14.728 --> 07:16.732
- All right, I better take off.
- Oh, no.

07:16.745 --> 07:19.402
You just got here,
and we spent the whole time moving.

07:19.416 --> 07:20.882
Why don't you come
in on thursday?

07:20.897 --> 07:23.311
I've got to wine-and-dine some clients,
but you should join us, it'll be fun.

07:23.347 --> 07:26.002
We'll rack up an obscene bill at
Nobu and charge it all to my dad.

07:26.018 --> 07:28.422
I can't.
It's Lucy's 21st birthday on thursday.

07:28.435 --> 07:29.951
We're throwing her a big party.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.430
I was hoping you
might be able to come.

07:31.465 --> 07:32.593
I can't -- Nobu.

07:32.608 --> 07:34.582
Nobu, schmobu.
It's a college party.

07:34.595 --> 07:37.113
Don't you miss college parties?
Our theme's 2002.

07:37.126 --> 07:38.703
- Why?
- Just because.

07:38.718 --> 07:40.423
- What's your theme?
- Contracts.

07:40.435 --> 07:43.130
Boring. 2002's so much better.

07:43.146 --> 07:45.010
Just bring your clients,
and we'll let them tap the keg.

07:45.046 --> 07:46.370
- Right.
- Come on.

07:46.388 --> 07:50.003
It's a 2002 party, right?
In 2002, you were a college freshman.

07:50.018 --> 07:51.960
You would have been
bored by businessmen

07:51.977 --> 07:54.641
and thrilled to go to a party
thrown by hot senior girls.

07:54.656 --> 07:56.522
It's all very tempting,
but I have to go.

07:56.537 --> 07:57.480
- I know.
- I love you.

07:57.495 --> 07:58.520
Love you, too.

08:01.598 --> 08:03.860
I'll put you down for
half a day, Logan.

08:04.295 --> 08:05.471
Good morning.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.441
Well, good morning,
madame Defarge.

08:07.457 --> 08:10.771
Good morning, Mr. "I remember stuff
from english class in high school."

08:10.788 --> 08:12.373
Can I ask how long this Mr.
"Long sentence

08:12.408 --> 08:14.270
of words strung together"
thing is gonna last?

08:14.288 --> 08:16.062
I'm not sure, Mr.
"Doesn't understand

08:16.076 --> 08:18.522
the more annoying you tell me a bit is,
the more I want to do it."

08:18.555 --> 08:21.101
Look at you, knitting away,
just like a proper married lady,

08:21.115 --> 08:22.941
the picture of domesticity.

08:23.077 --> 08:26.132
So what's for breakfast, Martha Stewart?
Poached eggs? Blueberry muffins?

08:26.145 --> 08:27.753
Oh, is there gonna be
fresh-squeezed orange juice?

08:27.787 --> 08:29.733
'Cause I'd really appreciate it
if you could strain the pulp.

08:29.767 --> 08:31.923
Yeah, I got your strained
pulp right here, buddy.

08:31.937 --> 08:33.293
So what exactly
are you knitting?

08:33.306 --> 08:34.940
It doesn't matter
what I'm knitting.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.291
I'm knitting just to knit.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.443
Someone's philosophical.

08:37.455 --> 08:39.852
No, someone is in training
for the knitathon.

08:39.865 --> 08:41.851
And we get pledged
by the skein,

08:41.868 --> 08:43.330
so  I'm just working
on my speed.

08:43.345 --> 08:44.813
- "Knitathon"?
- Yeah.

08:44.826 --> 08:46.182
You didn't hear
about the knitathon?

08:46.217 --> 08:48.620
I did not hear about the knitathon.
Do you want something?

08:48.635 --> 08:51.201
Yeah. Poached eggs and
some orange-juice pulp.

08:51.218 --> 08:52.763
- How about coffee?
- Sold.

08:52.775 --> 08:55.553
So, we are holding a knitathon
the day after tomorrow

08:55.566 --> 08:58.162
to raise money to rebuild
the old muddy river bridge.

08:58.175 --> 08:59.101
What's wrong with the bridge?

08:59.136 --> 09:01.851
Well, we rebuilt it a couple years ago,
but now it's started to rot.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.273
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

09:03.286 --> 09:05.162
It's too bad, too,
'cause it was gorgeous.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.721
We all loved, loved, loved it.

09:06.735 --> 09:09.382
It was sturdy and strong, made out
of these beautiful japanese maple --

09:09.415 --> 09:12.833
which it turnes out is exactly the
kind of wood that attracts beetles,

09:12.848 --> 09:14.991
and I'm not talking
british-invasion kind of beatles.

09:15.008 --> 09:17.433
I'm talking the kind of
beetles that like to eat wood.

09:17.446 --> 09:20.531
So now we're gonna make it
out of a less-delicious wood.

09:20.548 --> 09:22.252
Ah. So, how goes the training?

09:22.265 --> 09:23.933
Are your fingers getting
strong and muscly?

09:23.968 --> 09:26.252
My fingers are fine.
It's these needles.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.572
I keep dropping stitches
'cause they're slippery.

09:28.588 --> 09:29.872
I need nonslip needles.

09:29.886 --> 09:31.330
Do they make nonslip needles?

09:31.345 --> 09:32.882
I don't know.
You know what, I'm gonna go into town

09:32.918 --> 09:34.422
and see if anyone's
selling them.

09:34.438 --> 09:36.492
- Oh yeah ? I'll come with.
- That's okay.

09:36.658 --> 09:37.923
No, no. I could use some air.

09:37.938 --> 09:39.960
Yeah, but I have
errands to run.

09:39.978 --> 09:41.662
Plus I got to go to
the dry cleaner's.

09:41.676 --> 09:42.862
So?

09:42.877 --> 09:45.570
So I don't want to subject you
to Lizzie the crazy dry cleaner.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.462
It's very intense, you know.
She starts complaining about --

09:47.497 --> 09:49.853
Why don't you want me to
come into town with you?

09:49.868 --> 09:52.820
Oh. Well, you know...

09:52.978 --> 09:55.632
I just want to give people...
time to adjust.

09:55.646 --> 09:57.662
- To?
- To you and me.

09:57.675 --> 10:00.613
I mean, I just want to be sensitive,
you know?

10:00.718 --> 10:03.020
You're not who they expected,
and I--

10:03.035 --> 10:06.452
I just don't want the marriage
to seem sudden, you know.

10:06.465 --> 10:08.431
I-I want to kind of
ease them into it.

10:08.448 --> 10:11.382
Is that why you didn't want to invite
any of your friends to your mother's party?

10:11.416 --> 10:15.193
No. Well, yeah, but 90% of it
was I didn't want them to have

10:15.208 --> 10:17.932
to deal with salsa dancing and
the peabodys and the sandborns.

10:17.947 --> 10:20.493
But I guess 10% is I
didn't want to feel like

10:20.507 --> 10:22.493
I'm shoving our marriage
down their throats.

10:22.508 --> 10:24.232
By inviting them to a party?

10:24.247 --> 10:27.763
So soon. I just don't want it to
seem like we're flaunting, you know.

10:27.777 --> 10:29.340
I want to give them
time to adjust.

10:29.355 --> 10:32.073
They're not gonna adjust
if they never see me.

10:32.086 --> 10:34.113
Yeah. You're right.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.040
Come on.
Let's go for a stroll.

10:35.058 --> 10:37.061
Okay, but a stroll.
Not a strut.

10:37.077 --> 10:40.412
Yes, I promise I will keep my
chicken-walking to an absolute minimum.

10:40.646 --> 10:43.032
- How long is this gonna go on?
- Couple more days.

10:43.048 --> 10:45.770
It's ridiculous already.
Somebody's gonna poke an eye out.

10:45.785 --> 10:47.011
You're just bumming 
'cause April's gone.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.981
First, get your hand
off my shoulder.

10:48.996 --> 10:51.280
Second, I'm not bumming,
and April is not gone.

10:51.298 --> 10:53.311
She just went back to
living with her mother.

10:53.326 --> 10:55.503
I'm just saying,
I'm feeling you, Luke.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.062
- Luke.
- T.J.

10:59.077 --> 11:01.161
- I need a drink.
- We don't serve alcohol.

11:01.176 --> 11:03.113
Well, then,
anything that's carbonated.

11:03.125 --> 11:06.033
If I drink fast enough,
bubbles tend to have the same effect.

11:06.045 --> 11:07.871
What  are you doing here?
Is Liz okay?

11:07.886 --> 11:09.733
She's gonna have a
baby at any moment.

11:09.745 --> 11:11.723
- It's not good, Luke.
- What?

11:11.735 --> 11:13.560
We're having a
baby at our house.

11:13.607 --> 11:16.782
We talked about this.
You're gonna be a great dad, T.J.

11:16.796 --> 11:20.000
No. You don't understand. We're having
a baby at our house any minute now.

11:20.017 --> 11:23.091
Liz wants to have our
baby in our living room!

11:23.106 --> 11:24.960
What? Why?
What about a hospital?

11:24.978 --> 11:28.350
She won't go! She's got it in her head
that this should be done at home.

11:28.368 --> 11:31.253
My sister is gonna
have her baby at home?

11:31.265 --> 11:33.561
She got the idea from --
phew! -- Marcy Hedges,

11:33.578 --> 11:36.282
who plays the midwife at
the renaissance festivals.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.993
Only Marcy has five kids --

11:39.006 --> 11:41.042
all born in hospitals --

11:41.058 --> 11:44.222
and now she's telling Liz
how amazing and natural it is

11:44.237 --> 11:45.541
for her to do it at home.

11:45.556 --> 11:46.652
This is crazy.

11:46.665 --> 11:50.413
Liz said she had Jess at a hospital,
and she wants to have this one at home.

11:50.425 --> 11:53.502
She has this birth coach,
called a doula.

11:53.518 --> 11:55.162
That's not her real name.

11:55.176 --> 11:56.943
Don't call her that.
She's very touchy.

11:56.958 --> 11:57.952
Her real name is Sandy.

11:57.966 --> 11:59.413
Okay. Sandy the doula.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.772
Anyway, Sandy's done about
200 of these home births,

12:02.785 --> 12:06.662
and she says statistically, they're
every bit as safe as hospital births.

12:06.676 --> 12:10.150
I can't believe she's
having her baby at home.

12:11.215 --> 12:14.623
Anyway, she wants you to
be there at the birth.

12:14.635 --> 12:16.972
She wants the baby to
be born around family.

12:16.988 --> 12:18.992
So I promised I'd
get you to come.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.452
Of course, sure. I'll be there.

12:20.468 --> 12:22.380
Just call me whenever,
and I'll come right by.

12:22.395 --> 12:24.611
Great. Thanks, Luke.

12:28.856 --> 12:30.040
That feels good.

12:30.056 --> 12:31.693
Yeah, all right,
I'll see you later, T.J.

12:31.705 --> 12:33.372
Just let me know when
the water breaks.

12:33.388 --> 12:35.123
Go take care of her, all right?

12:35.137 --> 12:36.770
- All right. 
- See you, man.

12:50.607 --> 12:54.423
That's it! All right,
this diner is now a knit-free zone!

12:54.438 --> 12:56.970
Stop knitting or
get the hell out!

12:59.675 --> 13:01.643
..yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.393
Needle in, yarn around,
new loop through, old loop up.

13:04.407 --> 13:06.903
Keep a gentle tension
on the strand!

13:06.916 --> 13:08.500
Humongous needle!

13:08.518 --> 13:11.031
Careful! Just because
it's decorative

13:11.045 --> 13:13.422
doesn't mean it's not sharp!

13:13.657 --> 13:15.011
- I don't like root beer.
- No?

13:15.027 --> 13:16.823
Not without carbonation.
You want it?

13:16.837 --> 13:19.763
- Your used dum dum?
- It's not used. It's vintage.

13:19.855 --> 13:21.110
It was nice of Lizzie, though.

13:21.126 --> 13:23.852
Dude, 15 minutes of
perchloroethylene talk?

13:23.868 --> 13:25.930
We earned those dum
dums fair and square.

13:25.946 --> 13:28.510
All right, knit and purl,
like brick and mortar!

13:28.525 --> 13:30.531
- Hey, Babette!
- Oh, hey!

13:30.546 --> 13:32.772
Keep going with the
rib stitch there.

13:32.788 --> 13:34.100
How are you, sweetheart?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.200
Hey, Christopher.

13:35.218 --> 13:36.243
How you doing, Babette?

13:36.256 --> 13:38.532
Congratulations on the
getting-married thing.

13:38.545 --> 13:41.090
I'd give you a hug,
but my hands are kind of full here.

13:41.108 --> 13:42.601
- So, you eloped.
- Yeah.

13:42.615 --> 13:44.361
We were in Paris,
and we eloped.

13:44.378 --> 13:47.401
That's smart, eloping. Smart.

13:47.416 --> 13:49.660
Who needs the hassle 
of a real wedding, you know?

13:49.675 --> 13:50.651
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:50.665 --> 13:52.741
All the planning and the fuss,
so much stress.

13:52.758 --> 13:53.583
Exactly.

13:53.598 --> 13:56.450
Plus the dress.
I mean, why would anyone want to buy

13:56.467 --> 13:59.650
a big, expensive wedding dress
you could only wear once?

13:59.668 --> 14:02.250
Except for me.
I got to wear mine twice.

14:02.265 --> 14:05.001
But once was for Halloween.
I was the bride of Chucky.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.370
Oh, yeah?
Did Morey go as Chucky?

14:06.386 --> 14:09.412
Huh?! No,
he was a futuristic pirate!

14:09.428 --> 14:11.810
So, welcome to Stars Hollow!

14:11.828 --> 14:13.583
Thank you.
It's good to be here.

14:13.717 --> 14:15.291
Knit and purl!

14:15.308 --> 14:17.640
Lorelai, Christopher,
there you are.

14:17.658 --> 14:18.570
Hey, Patty.

14:18.585 --> 14:20.433
I'm sorry I didn't get
this to you sooner.

14:20.448 --> 14:22.582
Part of my job as
town social chair

14:22.598 --> 14:25.732
is greeting all newlyweds with
the Stars Hollow welcome wagon.

14:25.745 --> 14:27.610
Look at all this.
Thank you so much.

14:27.625 --> 14:30.852
Just a few odds and ends from our
town merchants to say "welcome."

14:30.868 --> 14:33.671
This is so cool. I didn't know the
welcome wagon came in a real wagon.

14:33.686 --> 14:34.832
Yeah.

14:34.847 --> 14:37.171
Well... so there you go.

14:37.188 --> 14:39.133
- Oh, terrific. Thank you.
- Thank you, Patty.

14:39.147 --> 14:42.091
So, how are you adjusting to
Stars Hollow, Christopher?

14:42.105 --> 14:43.501
Oh, it's terrific.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.672
I'd bet you're bored
senseless here.

14:45.687 --> 14:47.180
No, no. Not at all.

14:47.197 --> 14:50.363
There's hardly any nightlife.
I mean,  a worldly guy like you

14:50.375 --> 14:52.140
must feel like he's
out in the sticks.

14:52.155 --> 14:55.101
Well, my discothequing
days are mostly behind me.

14:55.117 --> 14:57.850
Anyway, I probably should run.
Enjoy the wagon.

14:57.865 --> 14:59.673
- Thank you.
- Bye, Patty.

15:00.908 --> 15:02.052
You want a ride?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.640
No. That's okay.

15:15.017 --> 15:17.251
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:17.266 --> 15:20.201
Um, I have some 2002
paraphernalia here.

15:20.217 --> 15:21.471
Okay.

15:22.086 --> 15:24.022
Are Lucy and Olivia home?

15:24.308 --> 15:25.400
No.

15:25.937 --> 15:28.173
'Cause they said to
bring this stuff by.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.093
Do you know when
they'll be back?

15:30.285 --> 15:31.181
No.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.750
Do you know where they went?

15:32.788 --> 15:34.131
- Just down the hall.
- Rory!

15:34.148 --> 15:37.012
- Yay! Rory's here!
- Oh, hey, guys.

15:37.028 --> 15:38.721
- You brought stuff.
- As promised.

15:38.735 --> 15:41.183
- Let's see.
- Boyfriend.

15:41.705 --> 15:42.790
Nice poster work.

15:42.805 --> 15:45.071
I went with double-sided 
tape rather than thumbtacks.

15:45.085 --> 15:46.683
I think it gives
it a cleaner look.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.192
I think you're right.
Plus, double-sided tape is so 2002.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.391
- You're a genius.
- You're my inspiration.

15:51.656 --> 15:53.982
- You brought J.Lo?
- Of course.

15:53.998 --> 15:56.840
- And I have boots.
- Oh, my god, so did we!

15:58.057 --> 15:59.791
We are gonna ugg-ugg!

15:59.805 --> 16:02.151
My feet were so much more
comfortable in 2002.

16:02.167 --> 16:03.203
What  do you think, boyfriend?

16:03.237 --> 16:04.661
Very Clydesdale.

16:04.678 --> 16:07.472
Hey, compliments only from
boyfriends on birthdays.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.722
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

16:12.235 --> 16:14.250
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Anna.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.181
- How's April doing?
- She's doing great.

16:16.196 --> 16:18.672
I'm pretty sure as of friday,
she had shown her appendix scar

16:18.685 --> 16:21.681
to every one of her teachers and
classmates. She's quite proud of it.

16:21.696 --> 16:22.930
I'm just glad she's doing good.

16:22.947 --> 16:23.891
Yeah, me too.

16:23.908 --> 16:26.223
Um, can we talk in private?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.541
Sure. Come on up.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.033
Caesar, I'll be back!

16:31.705 --> 16:33.513
Oh, the place looks nice.

16:33.528 --> 16:34.721
April's handiwork.

16:34.737 --> 16:37.360
Right. She told me -- cerulean.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.470
So, um... my mom --

16:41.486 --> 16:42.760
Yeah. How's she doing?

16:42.776 --> 16:44.112
Still recovering.

16:44.126 --> 16:45.802
I think I have her
care all worked out,

16:45.815 --> 16:49.641
but it is an ongoing rubik's cube
of day, night, and weekend nurses.

16:49.656 --> 16:50.752
That's tough.

16:50.765 --> 16:53.251
Yeah, especially being on the
other side of the country.

16:53.265 --> 16:55.130
And she's really lonely.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.652
I thought about
moving her up here.

16:57.665 --> 17:00.531
But she's been living in
that house for 42 years,

17:00.547 --> 17:02.103
and I just feel like
it would be cruel.

17:02.115 --> 17:05.393
Yeah. Say,
April can stay with me any time.

17:05.407 --> 17:07.002
Whatever you need.

17:07.396 --> 17:08.663
Luke...

17:08.726 --> 17:11.820
I've decided that April and I
are gonna move to New Mexico.

17:11.837 --> 17:14.153
Oh. Really? Wow.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.102
Yeah, I-I'm sorry,
but my mother is all alone.

17:17.117 --> 17:21.130
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, it's, uh... wow.

17:21.147 --> 17:23.371
But it's where I grew up,
so I know the area.

17:23.386 --> 17:25.002
They have a lot of
really good schools.

17:25.016 --> 17:27.150
Does April know?

17:27.588 --> 17:31.040
- I told her last night.
- How's -- I mean...

17:31.225 --> 17:32.830
is she okay with it?

17:32.848 --> 17:34.202
Well, she's not thrilled.

17:34.217 --> 17:36.121
It'll take some
getting used to, but...

17:36.136 --> 17:38.302
So, when? How soon?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.842
As soon as possible.

17:39.857 --> 17:42.683
Tina, my assistant manager,
is gonna run the business for me.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.730
I've already been
looking online at houses,

17:44.747 --> 17:46.401
found a nice
little neighborhood.

17:46.837 --> 17:50.341
And I just --
I wanted to, you know, let you know.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.150
Yeah. Hey, uh, I guess you got to
do what you got to do, you know.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.001
I mean, when my dad was sick...

17:57.018 --> 17:58.543
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:00.338 --> 18:01.692
I should go.

18:02.077 --> 18:04.502
- I have some things.
- Sure. Sure.

18:06.026 --> 18:06.963
Yeah.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.910
Drat you,
you dratted spaghetti,

18:15.928 --> 18:18.271
you slippery, slithery,
uncooperative --

18:18.286 --> 18:19.922
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

18:19.937 --> 18:23.250
Seriously, if you and spaghetti need
privacy, I can come back later.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.602
In the middle of the night last night,
I woke up with an idea.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.580
Yeah?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.413
For days,
I've been trying to figure out

18:28.425 --> 18:30.413
what to serve at my
knitathon booth, right?

18:30.425 --> 18:33.812
So, it's 2:00 a.m.
Flash! I have a vision.

18:33.857 --> 18:37.183
Balls of yarn made
out of spaghetti,

18:37.197 --> 18:39.691
with breadsticks stuck in the middle,
like knitting needles.

18:39.707 --> 18:42.293
It's brilliant!
Brilliant! Horrible!

18:42.307 --> 18:44.780
Not that appetizing. Why don't
you just make regular spaghetti?

18:44.816 --> 18:46.502
'Cause that's not theme-y.

18:46.517 --> 18:49.803
Why are you in early? I thought
you were not coming in till late.

18:49.818 --> 18:51.862
Well, I was,
but I had some paperwork and...

18:51.877 --> 18:52.740
And, um...

18:52.757 --> 18:54.523
Christopher and I just
walked through town.

18:54.537 --> 18:55.453
And?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.952
Everyone was very cordial.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.240
Ooh. Cordial?

18:58.255 --> 19:01.130
Yes. They said hello.
They shook his hand.

19:01.145 --> 19:02.912
They welcomed him
to Stars Hollow.

19:02.926 --> 19:04.172
Jeez, really? Cordial?

19:04.187 --> 19:07.070
Yes. Creepy, right?
I saw miss Patty and Babette.

19:07.088 --> 19:08.520
Neither one of them
pinched his butt.

19:08.558 --> 19:10.303
Well, honey,
you married an outsider.

19:10.318 --> 19:11.212
I know.

19:11.225 --> 19:13.150
We just --
we all thought you and Luke...

19:13.166 --> 19:15.550
I knew people thought me and Luke.
I thought me and Luke.

19:15.566 --> 19:17.823
But it's not me and Luke.
It's me and Christopher.

19:17.836 --> 19:20.722
I know. It's just --
people really loved you and Luke.

19:20.736 --> 19:22.750
Right. But it's not their life.
It's my life.

19:22.768 --> 19:25.612
And frankly, I don't see why I
should have to go around feeling bad

19:25.628 --> 19:28.142
that my life didn't turn out
the way everybody wanted it to.

19:28.155 --> 19:30.990
- I know--
- I'm sick of it. I really am.

19:31.006 --> 19:33.040
And, look,
I understand that you liked Luke

19:33.057 --> 19:35.273
and you're not so sure
about Christopher,

19:35.285 --> 19:37.283
but, Sookie,
you're my best friend.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.361
I really need your
support here.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.702
I mean,
Christopher is my husband,

19:41.716 --> 19:44.500
and it would be great if
you would just get on board.

19:44.518 --> 19:45.851
- Okay.
- Okay?

19:45.866 --> 19:47.911
Yeah, I'm on board.
What do you need?

19:47.926 --> 19:51.810
I'll swab the deck, I'll hoist
the sail -- anything nautical.

19:51.826 --> 19:54.540
Okay, I need you to help me get
the rest of the town on board.

19:54.557 --> 19:56.060
- Okay.
- Okay. What do we do?

19:56.078 --> 19:58.182
- We need a campaign.
- Right. A campaign.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.720
Oh, he could walk Paul
Anka around town.

20:00.737 --> 20:03.500
Cute guy, cute dog --
very appealing.

20:03.518 --> 20:05.792
Paul Anka's not good with sidewalks --
sensitive paws.

20:05.807 --> 20:08.001
He could pull him in the
welcome wagon -- or Jackson.

20:08.016 --> 20:09.773
You want him to pull
Jackson around on a wagon?

20:09.807 --> 20:11.782
No, maybe he and Jackson
could do something together.

20:11.816 --> 20:13.413
You know,
Jackson's got a lot of clout.

20:13.426 --> 20:15.172
If people see that
Jackson likes Christopher,

20:15.206 --> 20:16.763
then maybe they'll
like Christopher.

20:16.777 --> 20:18.351
You think Jackson's
got a lot of clout?

20:18.368 --> 20:20.512
Jackson has tons of clout.
He's lousy with clout.

20:20.527 --> 20:22.393
Okay. What should they do?

20:22.406 --> 20:24.042
Something where
they'll be seen.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.100
Ooh, how about a movie?

20:25.117 --> 20:26.231
- Too dark.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:26.248 --> 20:27.273
Pancakes at Al's?

20:27.286 --> 20:28.623
Jackson is off of wheat.

20:28.636 --> 20:30.932
But, ooh, how about 
country night at miss Patty's?

20:30.947 --> 20:32.032
Chris and Jackson?

20:32.046 --> 20:35.300
Well, I mean, Jackson is a fiendish
two-stepper, but he's handsy.

20:35.316 --> 20:36.930
- What do regular guys do?
- Grunt?

20:36.947 --> 20:38.462
- Scratch?
- Leave the toilet seat up?

20:38.478 --> 20:39.780
- Talk about sports?
- Talk about cars?

20:39.815 --> 20:40.943
- Burp?
- Beer!

20:40.956 --> 20:42.690
- Drink beer.
- At Casey's!

20:42.707 --> 20:44.131
- Perfect.
- Oh, like manly.

20:44.147 --> 20:45.323
- Simple.
- Ooh!

20:45.337 --> 20:48.391
And while they're scratching and grunting,
 we can actually go do something fun.

20:48.428 --> 20:51.311
- Country night at miss Patty's.
- Mm-hmm. Hee-haw.

20:52.147 --> 20:53.940
So, what are you up for tonight?
I was thinking we could

20:53.977 --> 20:55.843
rent "A brief history
of time" again.

20:55.856 --> 20:58.701
Maybe I'll understand something
more than the credits this time.

20:58.718 --> 20:59.642
Sure.

20:59.655 --> 21:02.511
Look... your mom told
me you were moving.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.863
- To New Mexico.
- Yes, it's not so bad.

21:04.878 --> 21:07.141
You've been there visiting
your grandma before, right?

21:07.155 --> 21:09.063
I don't want to
move to the desert!

21:09.077 --> 21:10.633
It's just--
there aren't even any seasons!

21:10.665 --> 21:13.073
It's hot,
and it's a miserable place,

21:13.086 --> 21:14.942
- and I hate it!
- Let's take a walk.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.892
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

21:17.018 --> 21:18.760
Look, I know you're
a little upset,

21:18.775 --> 21:20.463
but this could be a
really good thing --

21:20.478 --> 21:23.392
I mean, the new people you'll meet,
the teachers you'll impress.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.960
- I'll never see my friends again.
- Of course you will --

21:25.977 --> 21:28.040
Breaks from school
over the summer.

21:28.056 --> 21:31.030
No, Janie Freedman moved to
Virginia at the end of last year

21:31.047 --> 21:32.632
'cause her dad got
some teaching job.

21:32.646 --> 21:34.400
And she said she'd stay
in touch with everybody,

21:34.438 --> 21:35.670
and she did for like a week.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.623
And then after that,
nobody ever heard from her again.

21:37.658 --> 21:38.630
It doesn't have
to be like that.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.980
We're moving 2,000 miles away!
That's how it's gonna work!

21:40.996 --> 21:43.612
- Mom is ruining my life!
- April.

21:43.627 --> 21:46.771
I'm finally happy.
I finally have friends.

21:46.788 --> 21:49.281
It took me forever,
and now I'm just gonna be

21:49.298 --> 21:52.980
that weird,
dorky loser girl all over again!

21:52.997 --> 21:56.011
I know. Come on.
It's gonna be fine.

21:57.388 --> 21:59.153
- I don't get it.
- What?

21:59.166 --> 22:00.953
- 2002 party.
- It's a theme.

22:00.968 --> 22:01.931
How is that a theme?

22:01.947 --> 22:02.973
It's just supposed to be funny.

22:03.008 --> 22:05.072
- I'm not laughing.
- Well, you don't have to go.

22:05.086 --> 22:06.432
Why not 2001?

22:06.447 --> 22:07.740
It could be 2001, I guess.

22:07.758 --> 22:09.191
"Space odyssey" --
that's a theme.

22:09.206 --> 22:11.280
People dress up like
astronauts or apes.

22:11.296 --> 22:12.682
I don't know what
to tell you, Paris.

22:12.718 --> 22:14.790
- Will there be dancing?
- Yes, it will be dancing.

22:14.805 --> 22:15.800
What kind of dancing?

22:15.817 --> 22:17.433
I don't know. 2002 dancing?

22:17.445 --> 22:18.681
So we're talking
mostly hip-hop.

22:18.716 --> 22:20.422
Paris, you don't have to
hip-hop-dance at this party.

22:20.457 --> 22:22.540
I can hip-hop-dance.
Don't you worry.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.412
Doyle and I will be
scorching the floorboards.

22:24.425 --> 22:25.950
Looking forward to that.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.961
- Hi, mom.
- So what are you gonna pledge me?

22:27.977 --> 22:29.763
- In the knitathon?
- Yeah, what do you say?

22:29.777 --> 22:31.891
- Like 10 bucks a skein?
- How about $5?

22:31.906 --> 22:33.232
- So, $15?
- Make it $3.

22:33.248 --> 22:34.862
- $20 a skein?
- A buck 50.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.610
- 25 smackeroos?
- 75 cents.

22:36.628 --> 22:38.102
We have no idea how to haggle,
do we?

22:38.118 --> 22:40.750
No idea. Why don't you just
put me down for $30 even?

22:40.767 --> 22:42.841
I will not take less than $30,
and then you got a done deal.

22:42.877 --> 22:43.951
The best I can do is $30.

22:43.968 --> 22:45.520
All right, you give me $30,
and it's a deal.

22:45.557 --> 22:46.941
Do I have to pledge dad, too?

22:46.955 --> 22:49.323
No, no, he's just a spectator.
Although, you know what he's doing?

22:49.357 --> 22:51.063
He's going on a
man-date with Jackson.

22:51.077 --> 22:52.761
Cute. A mandated man-date?

22:52.778 --> 22:55.170
Yes, it was
suggested enthusiastically.

22:55.186 --> 22:56.850
What is that you're
listening to?

22:56.868 --> 22:59.952
That's Paris. She and Doyle are
threatening to scorch the floorboards

22:59.966 --> 23:01.530
at Lucy's party.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.131
Aw. Poor floorboards.

23:03.145 --> 23:05.443
Hey, how did all
the party prep go?

23:05.457 --> 23:08.151
Good. We're just about ready
to party like it's 2002.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.843
There's just one thing though --
this whole Marty debacle.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.761
It's just so annoying
to be around him.

23:12.777 --> 23:14.760
Is he still acting
all cold and weird?

23:14.777 --> 23:16.813
Beyond cold and beyond weird.

23:16.826 --> 23:20.022
You're a hard one to get over, kid,
you know. He probably just feels bad.

23:20.037 --> 23:22.313
When guys feel rejected,
they act all cold and weird.

23:22.328 --> 23:25.871
Yeah, but I rejected him,
if that's even what happened, years ago.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.931
I mean, isn't there a statute of
limitations for being a jerk?

23:28.945 --> 23:31.260
Marty just probably
feels awkward.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.732
Maybe you should
try to be nice.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.282
He's not exactly
being nice to me.

23:34.295 --> 23:36.080
Well, you have to be
the bigger person.

23:36.096 --> 23:37.540
Why doesn't he be
the bigger person?

23:37.557 --> 23:39.973
Because you're 11 feet tall
and he's a mere mortal.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.350
I hate being 11 feet tall.

23:41.367 --> 23:43.943
I know.
It's hell finding jeans that fit, huh?

23:44.027 --> 23:46.851
I got to go.
I got a man-date fashion disaster.

23:46.866 --> 23:48.013
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

23:48.045 --> 23:49.841
So, uh, $30 a skein?

23:49.858 --> 23:51.901
- Total -- $30 total.
- Yeah.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.001
Hey.

23:53.866 --> 23:54.930
W-What?

23:54.948 --> 23:56.191
Is that what you're wearing?

23:56.208 --> 23:57.700
What? What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

23:57.735 --> 23:59.431
Nothing. It's just
that it's, um...

23:59.448 --> 24:01.162
- What?
- ...black.

24:01.175 --> 24:02.821
- It's a black shirt.
- Yeah.

24:02.838 --> 24:04.010
Okay, then.

24:04.595 --> 24:07.432
It's very Joaquin
Phoenix at the Oscars.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.402
I have no clue what that means.

24:09.416 --> 24:10.570
It's very fitted.

24:10.586 --> 24:11.882
I should wear a shirt
that doesn't fit?

24:11.916 --> 24:12.882
No.

24:12.898 --> 24:15.121
- Should I tuck it in?
- No!

24:15.137 --> 24:17.190
Why are you grimacing
at this shirt?!

24:17.207 --> 24:19.193
Um... I don't know.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.101
Maybe it's not the best thing to
wear on your man-date with Jackson.

24:22.118 --> 24:24.712
Okay, first of all,
if you say "man-date" one more time,

24:24.726 --> 24:26.500
there is no way in hell
I am leaving this house.

24:26.537 --> 24:30.261
And second, last I knew, I was about
to go and have a beer with a farmer.

24:30.278 --> 24:32.131
I don't think it really
matters what I'm wearing.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.642
Oh, it is very important that
you make a good impression.

24:34.658 --> 24:36.650
Lor, come on,
how great did our walk through town go?

24:36.687 --> 24:38.683
You were all worried about that,
and everybody was nice.

24:38.718 --> 24:40.460
- They were nice.
- It went great.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.961
- Eh.
- Didn't it?

24:41.977 --> 24:43.340
- Nah.
- What are you saying?

24:43.355 --> 24:46.912
I'm saying it didn't go so great.
They were cordial, they were polite.

24:46.927 --> 24:47.850
But the wagon...

24:47.866 --> 24:51.150
Was full of cleaning
supplies and shoe trees.

24:51.338 --> 24:53.243
When Claude and Michael
Davies got married,

24:53.258 --> 24:56.430
they got handmade clothing
and homemade baked goods,

24:56.447 --> 24:59.793
and the pizza guy
whittled them bookends

24:59.806 --> 25:01.793
in the shape of
senegalese tigers.

25:01.807 --> 25:03.341
That's a welcome wagon.

25:03.358 --> 25:06.402
We got a "we're tolerating
that you're here" wagon.

25:06.425 --> 25:07.493
Sorry.

25:07.596 --> 25:10.390
So, going out with Jackson
is important because...?

25:10.407 --> 25:13.871
Jackson is loved.
Jackson is respected.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.520
If you're in with Jackson,
you're in with Stars Hollow.

25:16.538 --> 25:18.900
Okay, maybe I could wear
the gray polo shirt.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.900
I love that idea!

25:21.555 --> 25:23.353
- What about the jeans?
- They're fine.

25:23.365 --> 25:24.613
They're just a little tight.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.800
All right,
I'll change the jeans.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.073
The shoes?

25:28.086 --> 25:30.830
All right, I'll change the shoes.
I hate to say this out loud,

25:30.847 --> 25:34.141
but all of a sudden, I'm very nervous
about my man-date with a farmer.

25:34.156 --> 25:36.722
You're gonna be great.

25:38.306 --> 25:39.983
Not too much stuff in the hair!

25:40.395 --> 25:41.770
So, what do you think?

25:41.785 --> 25:45.280
I'm down with any place where you can
throw your peanut shells on the floor.

25:45.296 --> 25:47.382
Not exactly a
Manhattan hot spot.

25:47.396 --> 25:50.390
A beer in Stars Hollow tastes
just as good as a beer in Soho,

25:50.405 --> 25:51.733
and it's a hell
of a lot cheaper.

25:51.745 --> 25:52.993
It's a Microbrew.

25:53.008 --> 25:54.811
They brew it right
here on the premises.

26:01.558 --> 26:04.520
So, what's your best crop?
Do you have a favorite?

26:04.538 --> 26:06.550
Don't get me started.
I love them all.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.973
But it has been a
standout eggplant year.

26:09.017 --> 26:10.781
- Do you like eggplant?
- Yep.

26:10.798 --> 26:13.551
Don't say another word.
I am your eggplant connection.

26:13.566 --> 26:16.070
Guess I'm gonna have to get
rid of my other guy, then.

26:17.917 --> 26:20.853
It's just -- it's just a joke.

26:21.945 --> 26:23.642
Oh. Yeah.

26:33.968 --> 26:36.502
- So, you and Lorelai, huh?
- Yeah.

26:36.516 --> 26:39.842
That's quite an achievement. I mean,
many have tried, many have failed.

26:39.858 --> 26:41.710
Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.

26:48.707 --> 26:52.320
You know what I love about farming?
The commitment.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.831
No shortcuts, no quitting.

26:54.848 --> 26:56.772
You have got to be
there for your crops

26:56.787 --> 26:58.311
morning, noon, and night.

26:58.328 --> 27:01.903
I mean, you can have the
greatest soil and perfect seeds,

27:01.917 --> 27:04.713
but if you are not
100% committed,

27:04.827 --> 27:07.112
you might as well pave
over those 32 acres

27:07.128 --> 27:09.520
and build yourself a strip mall.
You know what I mean?

27:09.537 --> 27:11.043
It's a lot of responsibility.

27:11.058 --> 27:12.772
It sure is.

27:13.226 --> 27:14.892
It sounds like you
really love farming.

27:14.907 --> 27:15.993
I do.

27:16.045 --> 27:18.033
Sookie and I, we both do.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.783
Me too.

27:24.298 --> 27:26.810
Yeahn okay. If you want to come by,
I'll be in all afternoon.

27:26.828 --> 27:28.872
Great. I'll see you then. Bye.

27:28.965 --> 27:30.361
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.210
Sure. What's up?

27:32.225 --> 27:35.000
Well, April --
she's pretty upset.

27:35.015 --> 27:36.391
Yeah, I know.

27:36.407 --> 27:39.100
I wanted to make sure we were
doing everything we could

27:39.116 --> 27:41.642
to make it as easy as,
you know, it could be for her.

27:41.657 --> 27:43.953
- So, what have you got in mind?
- Okay, well, I was thinking.

27:43.986 --> 27:46.230
Instead of pulling her out in
the middle of the school year,

27:46.267 --> 27:50.141
maybe you could wait to move
till the end of the school year?

27:50.156 --> 27:51.792
And you don't think
I thought about that.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.990
No, you could go back and forth,
and still be there for your mom,

27:54.027 --> 27:55.712
and I could help
covering for April here.

27:55.725 --> 28:00.102
No, I have to be out there full
time as soon as possible, Luke.

28:00.118 --> 28:02.711
Oh, well, she could stay
with me to finish the year.

28:02.726 --> 28:05.353
She's already been with me
for two months, you know?

28:05.365 --> 28:07.102
I'd love it.
It would be great, actually.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.533
Luke, I know you mean well,
but that's not gonna happen, okay?

28:09.566 --> 28:12.621
I'm not splitting apart
from April for six months.

28:12.637 --> 28:14.903
No, I understand.

28:14.918 --> 28:18.580
Okay, so, maybe, you know,
we could buy her some plane tickets

28:18.598 --> 28:22.142
so she'll know she's going
back and forth and when?

28:22.158 --> 28:23.792
We can't make that plan now.

28:23.806 --> 28:25.852
No, it doesn't have to
include everything.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.683
But, like, I already told
her she could stay with me

28:28.698 --> 28:30.752
for spring break 
and part of the summer, so if --

28:30.766 --> 28:32.982
Whoa. You told her that?

28:32.997 --> 28:35.061
- You actually said that?
- Yeah.

28:35.077 --> 28:37.423
I have no idea what
we'll be doing then.

28:37.438 --> 28:38.260
I just assumed that --

28:38.295 --> 28:40.660
You have no right making
promises to my daughter.

28:40.678 --> 28:41.660
I just wanted her--

28:41.676 --> 28:44.823
I don't want you talking to her
about this again. Are we clear?

28:44.835 --> 28:46.293
- Anna.
- No, Luke.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.073
Listen, these are my decisions.

28:48.088 --> 28:50.223
I'm not gonna have you
going behind my back,

28:50.237 --> 28:52.770
making promises to
April that I can't keep.

28:52.785 --> 28:55.663
So, are you saying
she's not coming back?

28:56.108 --> 28:58.640
I am saying I'm not
ready to make decisions.

28:58.657 --> 29:01.970
And they are my decisions to make,
not yours, Luke.

29:02.336 --> 29:03.802
Now I'm gonna go.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.292
Hello?

29:12.908 --> 29:14.341
It's showtime, Luke!

29:14.357 --> 29:16.661
What the hell's going on over there?
Is Liz okay?

29:16.677 --> 29:18.090
She's amazing!

29:18.105 --> 29:20.323
We're having a baby, baby!

29:20.336 --> 29:22.730
It's beautiful!
You got to get over here.

29:22.945 --> 29:24.571
I'm on my way!

29:41.195 --> 29:43.993
Free needles.
Free for everyone.

29:53.798 --> 29:56.740
Free needles! Free needles!

29:56.757 --> 29:58.903
See? Who says Stars
Hollow's not progressive?

29:58.916 --> 30:00.213
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys.

30:00.228 --> 30:02.022
- Yummy.
- Hey, Jackson. What's up?

30:02.035 --> 30:05.123
Hey. How's it going? So wednesday
night -- we still on to watch the game?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.110
Sounds good.

30:06.128 --> 30:08.313
All right, we're gonna stake out
some prime knitting real estate.

30:08.348 --> 30:08.810
See you later.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.413
- Save us a spot!
- We will.

30:10.426 --> 30:11.721
You're seeing Jackson
wednesday, huh?

30:11.755 --> 30:12.912
Yeah, we were thinking maybe.

30:12.927 --> 30:14.421
- I guess that could work.
- What do you mean?

30:14.456 --> 30:16.711
- I have some other plans for you.
- Plans?

30:16.726 --> 30:19.941
Yeah, you got bird-watching with Morey,
darts with Andrew.

30:19.958 --> 30:22.021
Ooh, and Glenn Belkin wanted
to have coffee with you.

30:22.055 --> 30:24.780
He is the head coach of the
peewee little league teams.

30:24.796 --> 30:26.002
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

30:26.015 --> 30:28.723
He think he might have a plum
assistant-coaching job for you.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.363
Assistant coach, huh?

30:30.376 --> 30:32.341
All right, I'm feeling the
knitting vibes right here.

30:32.378 --> 30:33.972
Hello, hello!

30:33.987 --> 30:36.550
Hiya, kids.
Boy, it's a chilly one, huh?

30:36.568 --> 30:38.730
Welcome, fair citizens
of Stars Hollow.

30:38.746 --> 30:41.423
We come together on this
glorious autumnal day

30:41.436 --> 30:44.872
to rescue our beloved
muddy river bridge.

30:44.886 --> 30:49.722
And the knitting will commence
at precisely 10:00 a.m.,

30:49.735 --> 30:52.812
and we will knit unceasingly
until our long day's journey ends

30:52.825 --> 30:54.960
at the stroke of 10:00 p.m.

30:54.976 --> 30:56.743
Taylor, 10:00 a.m.
is 40 seconds away.

30:56.757 --> 30:59.213
What? No.
I've got 3 1/2 more minutes.

30:59.227 --> 31:01.841
I've timed this speech to
last exactly 3 1/2 minutes.

31:01.855 --> 31:07.082
Um, a bridge is not merely a feat
of engineering and architecture.

31:07.095 --> 31:08.642
A bridge is also a metaphor.

31:08.657 --> 31:10.870
Taylor, I'm sorry.
Your watch is wrong.

31:10.888 --> 31:14.372
I have precise atomic clock time.
28 seconds.

31:14.388 --> 31:16.432
I'm with Kirk! 26 seconds!

31:16.446 --> 31:17.771
But I just got this watch.

31:17.787 --> 31:20.053
- Make that 22, 21.
- 20.

31:20.065 --> 31:23.463
As I was saying, a bridge is a metaphor,
a meeting place between here and there,

31:23.477 --> 31:27.480
between the past and the future.
The Golden Gate, the Brooklyn...

31:27.498 --> 31:29.240
to raise funds...

31:29.258 --> 31:32.010
- our duty as citizens!
- Nine seconds!

31:32.028 --> 31:34.640
Real-time accounting
of the funds approved.

31:34.656 --> 31:35.370
Seven seconds!

31:35.385 --> 31:36.762
- As we strive toward --
- Six!

31:36.777 --> 31:40.983
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

31:40.998 --> 31:43.532
Oh, fine! Go ahead and knit!

31:50.535 --> 31:53.032
Thank you! Thanks so much.

31:53.047 --> 31:54.323
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:54.336 --> 31:56.583
How are you enjoying
your first legal drink?

31:56.597 --> 31:57.983
Third, actually.

31:57.998 --> 32:01.900
I like it, although I kind
of miss being a lawbreaker.

32:02.828 --> 32:05.061
Oh, my god. It's Paris Geller.

32:05.078 --> 32:07.652
- I told you.
- You totally delivered.

32:07.667 --> 32:08.780
Who's the dude?

32:08.797 --> 32:10.001
That's her boyfriend -- Doyle.

32:10.018 --> 32:12.190
- I'm fascinated.
- Go talk to her.

32:12.275 --> 32:14.043
- Really?
- Yes, it's your party.

32:14.056 --> 32:14.712
How do I look?

32:14.728 --> 32:16.710
You look tiara'ed,
21, and fabulous.

32:18.115 --> 32:21.443
Hi! Thank you for
coming to my party.

32:28.487 --> 32:32.180
Barkeep, I'll have an upside-down
tequila slammer with a twist.

32:32.346 --> 32:34.291
I don't know how to make that.

32:34.626 --> 32:36.493
Yeah, I just made it up.

32:39.138 --> 32:41.383
Really? Is this the
way it's gonna be?

32:41.398 --> 32:44.553
I say something, and you grunt
and make me feel like an idiot?

32:44.565 --> 32:45.783
Really? That's it?

32:45.847 --> 32:47.093
What do you want me to say?

32:47.108 --> 32:48.862
Well, what I would
like you to say

32:48.877 --> 32:50.883
is that you've put me in a
really difficult position,

32:50.917 --> 32:53.561
and the least you can do
is not be a jerk about it.

32:53.588 --> 32:54.730
I'm sorry.

32:54.745 --> 32:55.782
Yeah?

32:55.846 --> 32:56.913
Yeah.

32:56.925 --> 32:58.960
So you're done being a jerk?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.391
Y-Yeah, I-I'm done.

33:00.406 --> 33:01.291
Good.

33:01.305 --> 33:04.451
So you still want that
upside-down tequila slammer?

33:04.468 --> 33:06.230
- With a twist.
- Right.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.331
- Probably has tequila in it.
- Yeah.

33:09.236 --> 33:12.241
Um, the upside-down part,
I'll have to improvise.

33:12.255 --> 33:16.301
But the slammer and the twist
are pretty straightforward.

33:16.648 --> 33:18.023
You might want to stand back.

33:18.035 --> 33:18.980
Oh, okay.

33:22.156 --> 33:25.823
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!
Go, Paris!

33:25.838 --> 33:28.561
Go, Paris! Go, Paris!

33:31.786 --> 33:34.540
Shh! It's okay, sweet girl.

33:34.556 --> 33:36.603
Y-You sure about
the name "Doula"?

33:36.618 --> 33:39.520
She's such a Doula.
Isn't that right, gorgeous?

33:39.535 --> 33:41.232
- It's cute, right?
- Yeah, no no.

33:41.248 --> 33:42.573
What's that, Doula?

33:42.588 --> 33:45.540
I want my uncle
Luke to hold me.

33:46.287 --> 33:48.353
Oh, no, no, no. You keep her.

33:48.368 --> 33:50.002
Please! Uncle Lukey!

33:50.016 --> 33:51.590
- No, really.
- Come on, Luke.

33:51.607 --> 33:53.313
I-I don't have to.

33:53.325 --> 33:55.091
I want my uncle
Lukey to hold me!

33:55.105 --> 33:56.770
Okay. Okay.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.731
- Here you go, Doula.
- Here we go.

33:59.095 --> 34:01.211
- Look at her.
- Hey, Doula.

34:01.225 --> 34:04.463
Isn't she beautiful? Look at her eyes.
She's got Liz's eyes.

34:04.478 --> 34:05.812
It's true.

34:06.175 --> 34:09.842
And --
and aunt Sissy's chin, right?

34:09.856 --> 34:12.532
- That's totally Sissy's chin.
- No, Sissy was adopted.

34:12.547 --> 34:14.263
- So?
- So.

34:15.266 --> 34:19.982
Well, I-I don't know how she does it,
but she's got her chin.

34:22.206 --> 34:23.993
What do you think, Luke?

34:24.165 --> 34:25.803
She's great.

34:25.824 --> 34:28.263
That's your uncle Luke.

34:28.355 --> 34:31.110
And Luke's daughter
is your cousin April.

34:31.125 --> 34:33.953
Now, I bet April is gonna be
your number-one babysitter.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.630
Am I right, Luke?

34:36.427 --> 34:37.811
Yeah. Sure.

34:37.824 --> 34:41.811
$2,200! Not bad, people!
Not good, exactly, but not bad.

34:41.828 --> 34:45.302
And we have seven more hours to make
up the rest, so keep on knitting!

34:45.315 --> 34:47.933
And as you do,
think of the bridge!

34:48.038 --> 34:49.290
Who wants coffee?

34:49.308 --> 34:50.630
Is that a rhetorical question?

34:50.647 --> 34:52.022
Thank you, Christopher.

34:52.034 --> 34:53.663
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

34:53.675 --> 34:54.952
Not without doping.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.132
You guys don't talk like that!
Think of the bridge.

34:57.148 --> 34:59.313
We'll never be able to look it in
the I-bar again if you let it down.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.480
How's it going?

35:00.497 --> 35:04.233
Well, I can't tell if my
hands are cramping or numb,

35:04.248 --> 35:07.012
but they just keep knitting. So I
guess I'm trying not to think about it,

35:07.048 --> 35:09.470
although I guess, right now,
I am thinking about it.

35:09.488 --> 35:12.210
Maybe scheduling an
outdoor event in november

35:12.227 --> 35:13.791
wasn't such a great move.

35:13.805 --> 35:16.160
It was a great move --
a Fred-and-Ginger-type move.

35:16.176 --> 35:17.860
It's just a brisk fall day.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.622
Nah, it's a bad move,

35:19.638 --> 35:22.712
but it's part of a great
tradition of bad moves by Taylor.

35:22.728 --> 35:24.982
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

35:24.996 --> 35:30.260
I just received a
donation of $7,800!

35:30.276 --> 35:33.153
Thanks very much to Stars
Hollow's newest resident,

35:33.165 --> 35:36.771
Christopher Hayden, for bringing
us up to our goal of $10,000!

35:36.785 --> 35:37.383
Honey?

35:37.398 --> 35:38.830
Christopher, you did that?

35:38.848 --> 35:40.281
Yeah. Well, yeah, I --

35:40.295 --> 35:43.801
Well, tha-- thank you.
Uh, i-it was really...

35:43.816 --> 35:46.130
Generous. It's generous, right?

35:46.145 --> 35:47.321
Yeah, generous.

35:47.335 --> 35:48.451
Thanks, Christopher.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.053
You're welcome.
I just figured --

35:50.065 --> 35:51.323
So what?
Do we stop knitting now?

35:51.357 --> 35:52.733
Okay, pack it up, people.

35:52.745 --> 35:54.421
I guess we stop knitting now.

35:54.436 --> 35:57.360
We've reached our goal.
Our work is done here.

35:57.377 --> 36:00.390
If we get that llama back in the next
half-hour, we're gonna save a bundle.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.760
Wait, you guys, what are you doing?
W-Why are you leaving?

36:02.776 --> 36:03.832
Well, you heard Taylor.

36:03.848 --> 36:06.063
Yeah, but nobody ever listens to Taylor.
Come on, we got to keep knitting.

36:06.096 --> 36:08.050
- It's seven more hours.
- What's the point?!

36:08.068 --> 36:09.961
The point is, it's fun.
It's a festival.

36:09.976 --> 36:12.860
We haven't even got rowdy. we haven't
even wrapped Taylor in yarn yet.

36:12.876 --> 36:15.020
- Like a big Taylor cozy.
- Yeah.

36:15.035 --> 36:18.240
But we already got all the money.
So, thanks very much, Christopher.

36:18.256 --> 36:19.190
You're welcome.

36:19.208 --> 36:20.400
Gypsy?

36:20.418 --> 36:22.401
7,800 buckaroos.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.070
Wow. You must really love
bridges, Christopher.

36:25.088 --> 36:26.230
What are you doing?

36:26.247 --> 36:27.812
I'm gonna go catch a movie.

36:27.825 --> 36:31.380
Wait a minute.
Where is your Stars Hollow spirit, huh?

36:31.395 --> 36:33.821
Where's the love of knitting
just for knitting's sake?

36:33.836 --> 36:35.211
At the movies?

36:35.415 --> 36:36.993
- Sorry, honey.
- Yeah.

36:37.146 --> 36:38.540
I wonder what's playing.

36:38.558 --> 36:40.692
I don't know, but I'll bet
it's nice and toasty in there.

36:40.725 --> 36:41.930
Thanks again, Christopher.

36:41.948 --> 36:44.050
Sure. Happy to help.

36:44.067 --> 36:47.962
Okay, let's get those needles down!
And careful, there, fellas!

36:47.976 --> 36:50.962
Just because they're decorative
doesn't mean they're not sharp.

36:59.228 --> 37:01.172
How is she still dancing?

37:01.187 --> 37:02.003
Paris?

37:02.018 --> 37:03.380
No -- Lucy.

37:03.398 --> 37:04.813
Paris I understand,

37:04.828 --> 37:08.070
'cause Paris has been training for
this like it's an olympic event.

37:08.087 --> 37:10.413
But Lucy?
Lucy weighs 11 pounds,

37:10.428 --> 37:12.532
and I'm pretty sure most
of that is tequila by now.

37:12.545 --> 37:14.281
The girl loves to move.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.351
Oh, buzz-cut boys
going through.

37:17.367 --> 37:19.750
Mmm! I'm going in.
I've got time for one or two

37:19.768 --> 37:21.890
more awkward interactions
before the night is through.

37:21.927 --> 37:23.052
Nice.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.940
The bar is closed!

37:27.958 --> 37:29.050
You finally quit.

37:29.067 --> 37:30.721
Nope, just ran out of booze.

37:30.736 --> 37:32.452
I think I drank most of it.

37:32.466 --> 37:36.661
That upside twisted slammer
was living up to its name, man.

37:36.676 --> 37:38.580
I don't know if I'm more
twisted or slammed.

37:38.595 --> 37:41.133
I'm both.
I think I had three of them.

37:41.148 --> 37:42.943
Or was it four?

37:42.958 --> 37:44.510
You know,
the last time I saw you drunk,

37:44.546 --> 37:46.943
you were passed out and
naked outside my dorm room.

37:46.957 --> 37:51.083
So, the truth comes out
after all these years.

37:51.095 --> 37:53.741
- You checked me out.
- I did not.

37:53.757 --> 37:56.682
- It was uncomfortable and weird.
- Well, it's for the best.

37:56.697 --> 37:58.891
I was quite the
scrawny freshman.

37:58.906 --> 38:01.480
I think I actually
weighed 98 pounds.

38:01.498 --> 38:03.762
But, you know, now...

38:03.775 --> 38:06.052
- You've been working out.
- Can't you tell?

38:06.067 --> 38:09.503
I'm huge. I'm massive.
I'm Marty Schwarzenegger.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.850
I can tell.
You're looking good.

38:11.867 --> 38:14.230
And you are more
beautiful than ever.

38:21.445 --> 38:24.151
Um, you should be
out there with Lucy.

38:33.247 --> 38:34.430
Hi!

38:39.095 --> 38:43.582
Why should I feel bad that I donated
$7,000 to help save the bridge?

38:43.597 --> 38:44.381
You shouldn't.

38:44.396 --> 38:47.433
I don't. I thought the point
was to save the bridge.

38:47.665 --> 38:50.681
Well, the point was to
save it with knitting.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.343
- That doesn't make any --
- I know it doesn't make any sense.

38:52.377 --> 38:54.123
That's Stars Hollow.
That's just how it is.

38:54.137 --> 38:55.810
It's hard for outsiders
to understand.

38:55.826 --> 38:57.421
So I'm an outsider?

38:57.438 --> 38:58.721
For now.

38:58.738 --> 39:00.192
I thought I was
doing a good thing.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.971
I know. You just don't have to
drop all that money like that.

39:02.985 --> 39:05.752
- I know I don't have to.
- You don't have to try so hard

39:05.768 --> 39:07.640
to get people to like you.
What?

39:07.658 --> 39:09.041
- That's funny.
- Why?

39:09.057 --> 39:10.813
'Cause you're the one who's
making me try so hard.

39:10.846 --> 39:12.831
Bird-watching,
backgammon, darts,

39:12.845 --> 39:14.903
assistant-managing a
peewee baseball team?

39:14.915 --> 39:15.981
I just want --

39:15.997 --> 39:17.780
I know.
You want people to like me.

39:17.798 --> 39:19.730
You know what?
I'm a likable guy.

39:19.745 --> 39:23.733
I always have been. I may not be the
smartest guy or the toughest guy,

39:23.747 --> 39:25.183
but I'm the guy
that people like.

39:25.195 --> 39:26.190
You are?

39:26.208 --> 39:29.100
And you know why people in
Stars Hollow are gonna like me?

39:29.115 --> 39:29.823
Why?

39:29.835 --> 39:31.791
Because I love you.

39:31.807 --> 39:34.102
And I'm gonna be here,
loving you.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.230
- You are?
- You bet.

39:36.245 --> 39:38.090
You know, when you're a farmer,

39:38.136 --> 39:40.293
you got to be there
for your crops.

39:40.305 --> 39:42.291
It's not about the
seeds or the soil.

39:42.308 --> 39:44.153
It's about being there,
being committed,

39:44.166 --> 39:46.630
all day, every day, forever.

39:46.648 --> 39:48.602
- Farmer, huh?
- Why not?

39:48.748 --> 39:50.800
You know what, Mr.
"Doesn't seem like he knows

39:50.817 --> 39:52.763
what he's talking about but
is actually pretty wise"?

39:52.797 --> 39:56.833
What's that, Mrs. "Goes through 500
emotions every hour of the day"?

39:57.097 --> 39:58.550
I love you a lot.

39:59.668 --> 40:01.360
Yeah, you're okay, too.

40:20.245 --> 40:21.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:23.315 --> 40:24.852
- April's not here.
- I know.

40:24.867 --> 40:27.532
She's sleeping at
Gabrielle Wilder's tonight.

40:27.886 --> 40:29.371
So, what's up?

40:29.388 --> 40:32.101
I also know that Gabrielle
has a peanut allergy,

40:32.116 --> 40:33.831
and before I drop her off,

40:33.845 --> 40:36.800
I check that April isn't
packing a snickers bar.

40:36.816 --> 40:39.680
I also know that she likes
Gabby's coin collection,

40:39.695 --> 40:42.573
so I thought I might take her
over to a coin shop in Stamford,

40:42.585 --> 40:44.403
'cause she'd like it.

40:44.417 --> 40:45.831
What are you doing here, Luke?

40:45.848 --> 40:49.060
You know, you're always telling me that
I can't do this with your daughter

40:49.078 --> 40:50.770
and that I can't do that
with your daughter.

40:50.806 --> 40:53.531
Well, she's not just
your daughter, Anna.

40:53.547 --> 40:54.781
She's my daughter, too.

40:54.796 --> 40:56.793
- Luke --
- No. No.

40:56.807 --> 40:59.171
I know I wasn't around
for all those years.

40:59.186 --> 41:01.190
But, you know,
that was your decision.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.751
That was your choice, Anna.

41:02.768 --> 41:04.742
And, frankly,
it was a damn lousy one.

41:04.758 --> 41:08.312
Okay, I didn't get to see her
born or take her first steps

41:08.328 --> 41:10.970
or take her to her first
day of school -- none of it.

41:11.417 --> 41:14.231
And I can never get any of that back.
It's gone!

41:14.646 --> 41:18.590
But that's not gonna happen anymore.
That, I can guarantee you.

41:19.007 --> 41:21.341
- What are you saying?
- That she's my kid, all right?

41:21.358 --> 41:23.892
She's our kid.
She's not just yours.

41:23.907 --> 41:26.032
And I'm not gonna let
you treat me this way.

41:26.046 --> 41:29.593
I'm her father.
God, why do I even have to say that?

41:29.605 --> 41:33.310
I mean, April and I,
we have this relationship, okay?

41:33.327 --> 41:35.861
A-And you can't
just decide things.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.010
That's not how
this works, okay?

41:38.028 --> 41:41.400
I mean, we have to make decisions
together, decisions about April.

41:41.417 --> 41:43.281
And I will fight you.

41:43.296 --> 41:46.582
I will fight you for that,
Anna, if I have to.

41:46.596 --> 41:48.321
I have rights.

41:48.486 --> 41:51.960
I'm her father,
and I have rights.
