Shalom, blogosphere.

00:01.863 --> 00:03.397
Jacob Ben Israel here
at McKinley High.

00:03.481 --> 00:05.949
"Sudden Death"
big stakes senior year--

00:06.017 --> 00:09.686
who will succeed
and who will fail?

00:09.737 --> 00:11.905
Finn Hudson,
mediocre quarterback,

00:11.990 --> 00:13.824
mediocre Glee Club lead.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.026
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:16.077 --> 00:18.045
Me? Uh...

00:18.129 --> 00:19.997
Yeah, I have plans.

00:20.048 --> 00:21.248
(bell ringing)
Um...

00:21.332 --> 00:22.966
My mom still hasn't decided

00:23.034 --> 00:24.718
if I'm going to Harvard
or Stanford yet.

00:24.802 --> 00:26.219
And where are you applying?

00:26.304 --> 00:27.871
I'm not.
I'm only a junior.

00:27.922 --> 00:29.306
Senior, junior, junior.

00:29.373 --> 00:30.424
Hello.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.426
Huh. I thought
you were a senior.

00:32.509 --> 00:33.977
Optical illusion.

00:34.045 --> 00:36.063
The chair adds a year.

00:36.147 --> 00:37.597
Uh...

00:37.682 --> 00:40.567
(singing scales):
* Me, me, me, me, me, me, you *

00:40.652 --> 00:42.319
* Me, me, me, me, me, me... *

00:42.386 --> 00:43.487
I'm glad you asked.

00:43.554 --> 00:44.821
This year we'll
both be applying

00:44.889 --> 00:46.356
to a New York-based
performing arts school--

00:46.407 --> 00:47.607
(sneezes)
Juilliard.

00:47.692 --> 00:48.859
We'll get an eclectic
little apartment

00:48.910 --> 00:50.110
on the Lower East Side...

00:50.194 --> 00:51.495
<i>Think Bette and Barbara
Hershey in Beaches,</i>

00:51.562 --> 00:52.996
pre-cardiomyopathy.

00:53.064 --> 00:54.414
I'll originate a role
in a new Sondheim musical;

00:54.499 --> 00:56.667
Tony by 25.
Married by 3

00:56.734 --> 00:58.085
* Leg-a-lly! *
Broadway, Lincoln Center,

00:58.169 --> 01:00.537
West End, a tasteful
HBO miniseries.

01:00.588 --> 01:02.422
It's all right here
in my planner, you see?

01:02.507 --> 01:04.741
Twitter says you're officially
dating Sam Evans,

01:04.792 --> 01:08.095
AKA Trouty Mouth,
AKA Hobo McBieber.

01:08.179 --> 01:09.680
Honey, that is so June.

01:09.747 --> 01:12.215
Yeah, Sam and I dated, but
his dad got a job out of state.

01:12.266 --> 01:14.217
But I'm gonna give
you an exclusive:
Ooh.

01:14.268 --> 01:16.136
There's a new man
in Mercedes' life now,

01:16.220 --> 01:17.854
and he's my future plans.

01:17.922 --> 01:19.606
I'm not your only
your future plans, baby.

01:19.691 --> 01:21.091
You're gonna be a star,

01:21.142 --> 01:23.060
and when you graduate
and win that first Grammy,

01:23.111 --> 01:24.945
we're gonna make
beautiful cocoa babies.

01:25.029 --> 01:28.315
Ooh, baby, how you talk.

01:28.399 --> 01:30.233
Senior year is all about
being the Cheerios! top 'ho

01:30.284 --> 01:32.119
and modeling my fierceness

01:32.203 --> 01:34.821
after my numero uno
Latina: Paula Abdul.

01:34.906 --> 01:36.573
Paula Abdul is an Arab.

01:36.624 --> 01:38.325
Hey, has anyone seen
Quinn Fabray?

01:38.409 --> 01:39.626
Hi.
Hi.

01:39.711 --> 01:41.628
Ooh, Brittany, what are
your plans for the future?

01:41.713 --> 01:43.046
Wait.

01:43.114 --> 01:46.116
Are you working
on a time machine, too?

01:46.167 --> 01:48.385
I'm really excited
about this year.

01:48.452 --> 01:51.121
Okay... cool.

01:51.172 --> 01:53.340
<i>FINN:
The truth is, I have no idea
what I'm doing.</i>

01:53.424 --> 01:55.258
<i>I look around, and everyone

01:55.309 --> 01:56.727
<i>or at least what they want.</i>

01:56.794 --> 01:58.311

(bell ringing)

02:40.638 --> 02:42.606
Mr. Shue, why are
all of our trophies

02:42.673 --> 02:44.391
in the middle
of the room?

02:44.475 --> 02:46.610
I was sure that our
Nationals trophy would
grow during the summer.

02:46.677 --> 02:48.228
I want this image burned
into your mind.

02:48.312 --> 02:49.362
This is what the difference

02:49.447 --> 02:50.614
between first

02:50.681 --> 02:52.199
and 12th place looks like.

02:52.283 --> 02:54.117
It's also what it feels like.

02:54.185 --> 02:56.403
Are you planning on bumming us
out all year long?
No.

02:56.487 --> 02:57.704
I'm planning on
pushing you harder

02:57.789 --> 02:58.955
than you've ever
been pushed.

02:59.023 --> 03:01.357
We made it to Nationals
last year.

03:01.409 --> 03:03.526
This year, I'm not going to let
anything or anyone

03:03.578 --> 03:06.296
stop us from winning it all;
I let you down last year.

03:06.363 --> 03:09.199
I lost focus, let some Broadway
pipe dream get in the way.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.201
And we're really sorry
that the guy who replaced you

03:11.252 --> 03:12.869
in April Rhodes' musical
won the Tony.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.370
I mean, I can only
imagine your regret.

03:14.422 --> 03:16.056
MERCEDES: Yeah, you
know what I regret?

03:16.140 --> 03:18.842
Being the laughingstock
of the show choir world.

03:18.893 --> 03:20.477
And that's saying something.

03:20.544 --> 03:21.895
Mercedes has a point.

03:21.979 --> 03:23.880
Finn and Rachel's
"The Kiss That Missed"

03:23.931 --> 03:25.315
already has 20,000
views on YouTube,

03:25.382 --> 03:27.050
and the comments section

03:27.101 --> 03:29.069
is just full of
pithy banter like

03:29.153 --> 03:31.438
"Why is that T Rex
eating the Jew?"

03:31.522 --> 03:34.074
How many times do we
have to apologize?
Yeah.
No more apologies.

03:34.158 --> 03:35.075
The school hates us
even more now.

03:35.159 --> 03:36.493
Which is why we have to work

03:36.560 --> 03:38.161
even harder this year
to recruit new members.

03:38.229 --> 03:39.329
We're three men down.

03:39.396 --> 03:40.614
Yeah, only because Puckerman

03:40.698 --> 03:42.398
couldn't convince Zizes to stay.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.951
What we had was hot, but after
the debacle of Nationals,

03:45.036 --> 03:46.419
the Glee Club is not,

03:46.504 --> 03:48.672
and my cool factor
can't withstand it,

03:48.739 --> 03:50.507
all right?
My rep is in free fall.

03:50.574 --> 03:52.843
Oh, don't be sad.

03:52.910 --> 03:54.427
We'll always have Subway.

03:54.512 --> 03:55.962
<i>PUCK:
She's the one that got away--</i>

03:56.047 --> 03:59.182
really, really slowly.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.650
Where's Quinn?
ARTIE: MIA.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.219
No one's heard from her.

04:02.270 --> 04:03.603
It's sad; I miss her.

04:03.688 --> 04:05.055
No one is going to join,
Mr. Shue.

04:05.106 --> 04:06.273
They will.

04:06.357 --> 04:07.757
All they need is a
little inspiration--

04:07.808 --> 04:09.359
and I happen to have some,

04:09.426 --> 04:10.894
courtesy of Al Motta
of Motta's Pianos.

04:10.945 --> 04:12.095
Bring 'em in, guys!

04:12.146 --> 04:14.397
WILL: You guys are going
to love this.

04:14.448 --> 04:15.949
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:16.033 --> 04:17.600
Okay, if there are
purple pianos

04:17.652 --> 04:20.103
involved in this,
I am on board.

04:20.154 --> 04:23.439
These pianos were repossessed
from foreclosed homes.

04:23.491 --> 04:25.825
They're cast-offs,
just like all of us.

04:25.910 --> 04:28.678
Used, in need of repairs.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.747
But they're still capable
of making beautiful music.

04:30.798 --> 04:33.216
WILL: Right. So Mr. Motta,
as a lover of the arts,

04:33.284 --> 04:35.719
agreed to donate them to Glee.

04:35.786 --> 04:37.304
I fixed them up,

04:37.388 --> 04:38.755
painted them purple,

04:38.806 --> 04:40.724
and The Purple Piano Project
was born.

04:40.791 --> 04:43.977
Now, I'm going to be placing
these grapey uprights randomly

04:44.061 --> 04:45.929
throughout the school,
and whenever you see one,

04:45.980 --> 04:47.314
no matter what you're doing,

04:47.398 --> 04:49.149
I want you to sing a song.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.901
Now, use this assignment
to attract kids

04:50.968 --> 04:52.769
who are just like you--

04:52.820 --> 04:55.021
kids who can't
keep the music inside.

04:55.106 --> 04:56.773
Those are the kinds of additions

04:56.824 --> 04:59.075
that we need
to win it all this year.

04:59.143 --> 05:00.310
(sighs)
Now, for many of you,

05:00.361 --> 05:02.645
this is your last year.

05:02.697 --> 05:04.080
Let's make it special.

05:04.148 --> 05:05.365
(bell ringing)

05:05.449 --> 05:07.968
We have an important
announcement to make.

05:08.035 --> 05:09.485
I thought this day might come.

05:09.537 --> 05:11.254
Really, this is the only
dating combination

05:11.322 --> 05:12.839
that the Glee Club hasn't tried.

05:12.924 --> 05:14.090
We're not dating.

05:14.158 --> 05:16.659
Kurt and I will be auditioning
for Juilliard,

05:16.711 --> 05:18.511
the nation's premiere
performing arts school.

05:18.596 --> 05:20.180
That's a very good plan, guys.

05:20.264 --> 05:21.097
It's fabulous.

05:21.165 --> 05:22.849
Except Juilliard doesn't have

05:22.934 --> 05:24.601
a musical theatre department.

05:26.771 --> 05:28.305
Wait, what?

05:28.356 --> 05:30.673
Have you guys thought about
somewhere closer to home?

05:30.725 --> 05:33.526
Kent State has a wonderful
musical theatre program

05:33.611 --> 05:35.845
and a macabre backstory,
so if you're having a bad day

05:35.896 --> 05:38.481
or if you don't get the lead
in a musical, you can say

05:38.532 --> 05:40.700
to yourselves, "You know what?
Things really could be worse."

05:40.785 --> 05:43.119
No... No, thank you.

05:43.187 --> 05:45.455
No one ever became a star
by playing it safe.

05:45.522 --> 05:46.990
We're going to New York.

05:47.041 --> 05:50.377
We are.
I think I have
the school for you.

05:50.461 --> 05:51.861
(drawer opens, then closes)

05:54.498 --> 05:55.999
NYADA?

05:56.050 --> 05:57.634
New York Academy
for the Dramatic Arts.

05:57.701 --> 05:59.052
<i>US News and World Report</i>

05:59.136 --> 06:00.887
ranked them the number one
college in the nation

06:00.972 --> 06:02.055
for musical theatre.

06:02.139 --> 06:03.306
It's really competitive,

06:03.374 --> 06:05.392
They only take about
20 students a year,

06:05.476 --> 06:08.228
but they do a regular mixer
for prospective students,

06:08.312 --> 06:10.397
and this year,
the Midwest's top talent

06:10.481 --> 06:12.548
is rubbing elbows at the Dayton
Doubletree on Thursday night.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.652
You could go and check
out the competish!

06:15.719 --> 06:17.937
Yay! Yay, college!

06:18.022 --> 06:19.155
(bell rings)

06:19.223 --> 06:21.724
The poll numbers
are in, Coach.

06:21.776 --> 06:22.942
Close the door.

06:23.027 --> 06:24.694
Becky, the special election

06:24.745 --> 06:28.248
to fill Ken "Heart Attack"
Weigand's congressional seat

06:28.332 --> 06:33.837
is in two months, and I am
in ninth place at six percent,

06:33.904 --> 06:35.755
well behind "Undecided,"

06:35.840 --> 06:37.407
that rapist running
from prison,

06:37.458 --> 06:39.909
and "I don't care, please don't
call me during dinner."

06:39.960 --> 06:43.630
<i>I thought the people wanted a
candidate who was for something.</i>

06:43.714 --> 06:46.216
That's why I took that
pro-deportation stance.

06:46.267 --> 06:48.084
But the people are angry.

06:48.135 --> 06:49.886
They want a candidate

06:49.937 --> 06:52.022
who's against something.

06:52.089 --> 06:54.424
What about toast?

06:54.475 --> 06:56.526
Bread's already been baked.

06:56.593 --> 06:59.062
I don't get why you
need to cook it again.

06:59.113 --> 07:02.432
Tsk. Oh, Becky, your
twisted genius excites me.

07:02.483 --> 07:05.652
That said, I'm on the
precipice of doom.

07:05.736 --> 07:09.489
I need to find something
everyone hates.

07:09.573 --> 07:11.157
(sighs)

07:11.242 --> 07:12.826
(piano playing "Chopsticks"
in distance)

07:16.464 --> 07:18.331
("Chopsticks" playing loudly)

07:18.416 --> 07:19.666
(slamming down keyboard lid)

07:21.785 --> 07:23.336
(cutters snipping)

07:23.421 --> 07:24.721
(strings clattering to floor)

07:24.788 --> 07:26.256
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:26.307 --> 07:28.641
I just realized that song
might be the national anthem

07:28.726 --> 07:30.343
from whatever country
you're from.

07:30.428 --> 07:32.095
That's really offensive.

07:32.146 --> 07:36.399
You know, I was really humbled
when your Glee Club

07:36.467 --> 07:40.186
made my sister's funeral
so very touching!

07:40.271 --> 07:44.190
In fact, I was so moved that
I have spent the entire year

07:44.275 --> 07:47.444
being nothing but kind
to you people.

07:47.495 --> 07:48.995
Today's only
the second day of school.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.198
You have no right to disturb
the learning environment

07:52.283 --> 07:55.285
of this school by playing
your jangly national anthem

07:55.336 --> 07:56.652
on Liberace's piano.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.157
Thank you.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.492
You're welcome.

08:02.543 --> 08:04.344
I have no idea who you are.

08:04.428 --> 08:05.762
I'm Nancy Bletheim.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.380
I teach geometry.

08:07.465 --> 08:09.048
I've been teaching
here for 42 years.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.433
So awkward.

08:10.501 --> 08:11.718
Those artsy kids, they think

08:11.802 --> 08:13.269
they can get away with anything.

08:13.337 --> 08:15.105
People who call
themselves "artists"

08:15.172 --> 08:17.023
think the rules don't
apply to them.

08:17.108 --> 08:18.391
It's so arrogant.

08:18.476 --> 08:20.360
Bless you, Sue Sylvester.

08:20.444 --> 08:21.611
You got my vote.

08:27.151 --> 08:28.518
You're quiet.

08:28.569 --> 08:30.403
No. I'm being
passive-aggressive.

08:30.488 --> 08:32.522
You promised that by
the first day of school,

08:32.573 --> 08:33.856
you'd make a decision.

08:33.908 --> 08:37.860
And yet, there you
sit, cute as ever,

08:37.912 --> 08:39.294
but still in your
Warblers blazer.

08:39.363 --> 08:41.080
I can't just bail
on the Warblers.

08:41.164 --> 08:42.131
Those guys are my friends.

08:42.198 --> 08:43.133
Okay, all right, fine.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.551
One final sales pitch,

08:44.635 --> 08:46.085
and then we can talk about
making over Nancy Grace.

08:46.170 --> 08:47.086
Okay.

08:47.171 --> 08:49.389
If you stay at Dalton,

08:49.473 --> 08:52.809
you and I are competitors.

08:52.876 --> 08:53.626
That's true.

08:53.694 --> 08:55.845
And I'm just not sure

08:55.896 --> 08:58.181
that our budding love
can survive that.

08:58.232 --> 08:59.382
Let me get this straight.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.651
I have to transfer

09:01.718 --> 09:03.436
because you're
just afraid that

09:03.521 --> 09:05.271
I'm going to beat
you at Sectionals?

09:05.356 --> 09:07.357
No, I'm afraid that
I'm going to beat you.
Ooh, ooh, yeah.

09:07.408 --> 09:10.160
And I know what that
does to you when I win.

09:10.227 --> 09:12.061
(laughing)

09:12.112 --> 09:13.830
Look, I mean,
honestly, I-I just...

09:13.898 --> 09:15.999
I just want to see you more.

09:16.066 --> 09:18.168
Yeah, I want my senior
year to be magic,

09:18.235 --> 09:20.170
and the only way
that's gonna happen

09:20.237 --> 09:23.506
is if I get to spend every
minute of every day with you.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.964
(bell rings)

09:31.048 --> 09:33.850
<i>QUINN: Senior year,
and I've finally found myself.</i>

09:33.917 --> 09:36.302
<i>I'm not sure what
the tipping point was--</i>

09:36.387 --> 09:37.470
<i>dyeing my hair,</i>

09:37.555 --> 09:39.606
<i>the nose ring,</i>

09:39.690 --> 09:41.641
<i>my ironic tattoo
of Ryan Seacrest--</i>

09:41.725 --> 09:45.528
<i>but one thing I know,
I'm never going back.</i>

09:45.596 --> 09:48.097
Quinn, look, this is our
senior year, and, frankly,

09:48.148 --> 09:50.149
being on the Cheerios!
isn't the same without you.

09:50.234 --> 09:53.453
You guys are such suckers for
going back to Coach Sylvester.

09:53.537 --> 09:56.289
Come on, screw her.
This is for us.

09:56.373 --> 09:58.441
We could win two national
championships this year.

09:58.492 --> 10:00.093
We joined the Cheerios!
together,

10:00.160 --> 10:01.895
we joined Glee Club together,

10:01.962 --> 10:03.530
we all slept with Puckerman
the same year.

10:03.597 --> 10:05.131
Mm-hmm.
We're like
besties for life.

10:05.199 --> 10:06.900
Yeah. Come on, Quinn.

10:06.967 --> 10:09.068
You know, we used to be like
the Three Musketeers,

10:09.136 --> 10:11.704
and now Santana and I
are like Almond Joy,

10:11.772 --> 10:14.107
and you're like a Jolly Rancher
that fell in the ashtray.

10:14.174 --> 10:16.342
You guys never understood
the pressure I was under.

10:16.410 --> 10:17.577
It sucked.

10:17.645 --> 10:19.112
I'm not interested
in the boys

10:19.179 --> 10:21.681
or the makeup
or the polyester outfits.

10:21.749 --> 10:24.517
Look, I've got a bar of soap
and a bottle of peroxide

10:24.585 --> 10:27.353
with your name on it
in my locker.

10:27.421 --> 10:30.757
Come on, Quinn, you can't
break up the unholy trinity.

10:30.824 --> 10:32.058
People grow apart.

10:32.126 --> 10:34.260
Deal with it.

10:34.328 --> 10:38.197
I've got new friends now, and
they accept me for who I am.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.584
<i>QUINN:
We call ourselves "The Skanks."</i>

10:41.652 --> 10:42.452
I'm Sheila.

10:42.519 --> 10:43.419
I'm Ronnie.

10:43.487 --> 10:44.921
They call me "The Mack"

10:44.989 --> 10:47.056
because I like to make out
with truckers at the rest stop.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.458
It's kind of
a double meaning thing.

10:48.525 --> 10:49.892
I once ate cat poo.

10:52.563 --> 10:54.597
RACHEL:
Hey, Quinn.

10:54.665 --> 10:56.266
Hello... Skanks.

10:57.534 --> 10:59.402
Your friend stinks
of soap, Quinn.

11:00.971 --> 11:03.439
We were friends once.

11:03.507 --> 11:04.707
Okay? And maybe
when you cut off

11:04.775 --> 11:06.209
all your hair last
year and thought it

11:06.277 --> 11:07.710
would solve all your problems,
I should have spoken up.

11:07.778 --> 11:09.012
Maybe when you dropped out

11:09.079 --> 11:10.546
of society this summer
and started dating

11:10.614 --> 11:12.081
that 40-year-old skateboarder,
I should have said...

11:12.149 --> 11:13.816
I'm not coming back
to Glee Club.

11:13.884 --> 11:15.585
We need you. O-O-Okay?

11:15.653 --> 11:18.187
Have you seen those-those
purple pianos around school?

11:18.238 --> 11:20.790
We're planning this... this big,
you know, recruiting number,

11:20.857 --> 11:23.159
and it's going to be a tribute
to the Go-Go's.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.328
I mean, who doesn't
love the Go-Go's?

11:25.379 --> 11:26.963
I prefer the Bangles.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.414
Okay.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.199
We need your...

11:30.250 --> 11:33.136
your tremulous alto and your
Belinda Carlisle glamour.

11:33.203 --> 11:34.554
I'll give you ten bucks
if you let me

11:34.638 --> 11:35.555
beat her up
for you, Quinn.

11:35.623 --> 11:37.540
I'm sorry you're so sad, Quinn.

11:37.591 --> 11:39.709
And... maybe you're not
going to believe me

11:39.760 --> 11:41.260
because we were
never really close,

11:41.345 --> 11:43.563
but I'm sad not seeing
you in the choir room.

11:43.647 --> 11:46.516
And we've all been
through so much together.

11:46.567 --> 11:49.268
We're a family, and this is
our year to get it right.

11:49.353 --> 11:52.322
We would love to have you
back in the Glee Club

11:52.389 --> 11:54.324
whenever you're ready.

11:54.391 --> 11:56.225
Okay?

11:58.278 --> 12:00.396
...making it the zoo's
bloodiest weekend

12:00.447 --> 12:02.415
in over six years.

12:02.499 --> 12:05.901
That's what I call
"panda-monium."

12:05.953 --> 12:08.204
Now let's hitch a ride
over to Sue's Corner

12:08.255 --> 12:10.089
with congressional candidate
Sue Sylvester.

12:10.174 --> 12:12.091
Take it away, Sue.

12:12.176 --> 12:13.960
(whistle blows)

12:14.044 --> 12:17.213
Western Ohio, ever since
the start of my campaign

12:17.264 --> 12:20.767
to replace Ken "My Heart Stopped
Beating and I Died" Weigand,

12:20.834 --> 12:23.085
I've been trying to be positive.

12:23.137 --> 12:25.788
Well, you know what, Fourth
Congressional District?

12:25.856 --> 12:28.608
Unless it's a day she's
being screened for hepatitis,

12:28.692 --> 12:30.610
this gal's not positive.

12:30.694 --> 12:33.363
And you know what's
getting me down, Western Ohio?

12:33.430 --> 12:36.282
The arts in public schools.

12:36.367 --> 12:39.268
Why? Because America is failing.

12:39.319 --> 12:42.438
China is on our ass, people.

12:42.489 --> 12:45.941
This isn't the 1960s anymore,
when jobs were plentiful.

12:45.993 --> 12:48.277
And it's not personal,
Will Schuester.

12:48.328 --> 12:52.165
The arts are expensive,
and we can't afford it anymore.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.716
That's why, tonight,

12:53.784 --> 12:56.085
I'm making a pledge,
Fourth Congressional District.

12:56.153 --> 12:59.088
If you honor me by electing me
your representative,

12:59.139 --> 13:02.291
I will suspend all public school
arts programs,

13:02.342 --> 13:03.459
and reject all
You've got to
be kidding me.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.511
federal and state
funding for the arts

13:05.596 --> 13:09.965
until every single student
reads at or above grade level.

13:10.017 --> 13:11.067
Until then, parents,

13:11.134 --> 13:12.802
if you'd like your teenager

13:12.853 --> 13:15.137
to join the Glee Club
or play a doorman

13:15.189 --> 13:17.473
in a boring four-hour play
about what it's like

13:17.524 --> 13:19.642
to be a middle-aged
gay New Yorker,

13:19.693 --> 13:22.144
feel free to pay for it
yourself.

13:22.196 --> 13:23.979
But until Ohio's kids

13:24.031 --> 13:27.250
can compete again, it won't be
on the taxpayer dime.

13:28.031 --> 13:31.191
And that's how Sue... sees it.

13:34.095 --> 13:34.105
+

13:35.407 --> 13:37.024
She can't do this!

13:37.075 --> 13:40.077
William, it's important you
don't take this so personally.

13:40.162 --> 13:42.280
First of all, Sue,
you ruined a piece

13:42.364 --> 13:43.981
of private property.
Allegedly.

13:44.049 --> 13:46.200
Also, you got
your facts all wrong.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.068
The arts help kids
do better in school.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.288
Kids in the arts
record the lowest instance

13:50.372 --> 13:51.572
of substance abuse.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.257
Tell that to Janis Joplin.

13:53.342 --> 13:55.376
So you see, Sue,
I do take this personally.

13:55.427 --> 13:56.911
You're not just threatening
an arts program.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.346
You're threatening
my livelihood.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.914
I need job security.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.265
I'm in a
relationship now.

14:01.350 --> 14:02.967
I-I'm... I'm thinking
about starting a family.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.519
Oh, how is it going
with Emma?

14:04.586 --> 14:05.520
I'm sure everything
in the bedroom

14:05.587 --> 14:06.921
is just completely normal.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.356
Yes!

14:08.423 --> 14:10.107
No. It's so frustrating.

14:10.192 --> 14:12.310
I get the green light,
and then the...

14:12.394 --> 14:14.478
the red light comes
just as quickly.
William...

14:14.563 --> 14:16.430
allow me to ladle you

14:16.481 --> 14:19.817
a piping hot bowl
of "this is how it is."

14:19.902 --> 14:21.869
I'm done squabbling
with you, okay?

14:21.937 --> 14:23.437
I'm on the
national stage

14:23.488 --> 14:25.940
in the white-hot stare
of the public eye.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.792
You know, ever since
my "Sue's Corner" last night,

14:27.876 --> 14:29.460
I've made tremendous gains
in the polls,

14:29.545 --> 14:30.828
and I'm neck and neck

14:30.913 --> 14:32.496
with that rapist
running from prison.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.615
So I got bigger
fish to fry

14:34.666 --> 14:36.450
than you and your
little Glee Club.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.319
So truce for now,
macaroni hair.

14:38.387 --> 14:40.137
Oh, and William,

14:40.222 --> 14:43.341
just know,
if you do anything to derail

14:43.425 --> 14:46.510
my bullet train to power,
I'll destroy you.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.479
(bell ringing)

14:48.564 --> 14:51.349
Ladies, I put plastic
on your chairs

14:51.433 --> 14:53.568
in anticipation
of this announcement,

14:53.635 --> 14:56.854
so feel free to wet yourselves
with excitement.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.407
You are my Cheerio co-captains.

14:59.474 --> 15:01.025
What?!
Wait. Co-captains?

15:01.109 --> 15:02.827
With... No. No way. Uh-uh.

15:02.911 --> 15:04.245
I can't work with her!

15:04.312 --> 15:05.830
Nah, nah, nah, see,
let me tell you how this

15:05.914 --> 15:06.981
gon' be, if I may.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.165
When I look
at a person,

15:08.250 --> 15:09.600
I don't see someone
who looks a certain way

15:09.668 --> 15:11.535
or has this or that amount
of chromosomes.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.954
I just see someone

15:13.005 --> 15:14.488
who I may or may not
have to destroy.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.940
So if you ever
tell me

15:16.008 --> 15:18.125
what to do, I will end you.

15:18.176 --> 15:19.794
Bring it, sandbags!

15:19.845 --> 15:22.346
Ladies, I am aroused.

15:22.431 --> 15:25.349
However, we have
a more pressing issue at hand.

15:25.434 --> 15:29.804
There are purple pianos
polluting this school,

15:29.855 --> 15:32.189
and I will seem weak

15:32.274 --> 15:34.976
if it appears I cannot control
my own workspace.

15:35.027 --> 15:38.312
I want you to track down those
pianos, take care of them.

15:38.363 --> 15:41.232
(snaps fingers)
Make it look like an accident.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.819
Santana, you like
playing both sides.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.570
Isn't that right?

15:46.638 --> 15:49.323
What team you playing
for this year?

15:49.374 --> 15:51.309
Losers or the winners?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.296
Team Sue.

15:55.363 --> 15:57.415
Glad to hear it.

16:02.137 --> 16:04.221
Why are you guys ignoring
Mr. Schuester's assignment?

16:04.306 --> 16:05.389
Wait, is there

16:05.474 --> 16:06.540
a purple piano
in here?

16:06.591 --> 16:07.675
Wow. How did any
of us miss that?

16:07.726 --> 16:09.260
Okay.
We have to do the number.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.261
Okay?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.712
We have to survive lunch.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.347
It's not fair that Mr. Shue
put the piano in here.

16:13.398 --> 16:14.882
It's too much pressure.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.234
I agree. That is like wearing
a red dress to a bullfight.

16:17.319 --> 16:18.886
The point of the assignment
was to find people

16:18.937 --> 16:20.104
who couldn't help
but join, okay?

16:20.188 --> 16:21.605
The more people
that we sing in front of,

16:21.690 --> 16:23.074
the more chances we have
of getting one.

16:23.158 --> 16:24.909
Okay?
It's simple mathematics.

16:24.993 --> 16:26.077
Which I stopped attending
years ago.

16:26.161 --> 16:28.195
No, no, hold on.
Rachel's right.

16:28.246 --> 16:29.280
How's anyone
supposed to believe

16:29.364 --> 16:30.665
we can go
to Nationals if we

16:30.732 --> 16:31.749
don't even believe in ourselves?

16:31.833 --> 16:33.400
Thank you.

16:35.403 --> 16:37.838
(The Go-Go's' "We Got the Beat"
begins)

16:44.346 --> 16:47.548
* See the people
walking down the street *

16:47.599 --> 16:51.352
* Fall in line just watching
all their feet *

16:51.419 --> 16:53.888
* They don't know
where they wanna go *

* They're walking in time *

16:55.724 --> 16:59.393

they got the beat *

16:59.444 --> 17:01.612
* They got the beat *

17:01.697 --> 17:04.031
* Yeah, they got the beat *

17:06.935 --> 17:09.653
* All the kids just
getting out of school *

17:09.738 --> 17:13.624
* They can't wait
to hang out and be cool *

17:13.709 --> 17:15.826
* Hang around till
quarter after 12:00 *

17:15.911 --> 17:18.212
* That's when we fall in line *

17:18.279 --> 17:21.464

they got the beat *

17:21.550 --> 17:23.416
* Kids got the beat *

17:23.468 --> 17:26.954
* Yeah, kids got the beat *

17:44.856 --> 17:47.742
* Go-go music
really makes us dance *

17:47.809 --> 17:51.328
* Do the pony,
puts us in a trance *

17:51.413 --> 17:53.748
* Do Watusi,
just give us a chance *

17:53.815 --> 17:56.367
* That's when we fall in line *

17:56.451 --> 17:59.453

we got the beat *

17:59.504 --> 18:01.789

18:01.840 --> 18:03.257
* Yeah, we got it *

18:15.303 --> 18:16.470

18:16.521 --> 18:19.056

18:45.634 --> 18:47.301

18:49.721 --> 18:51.806
God, no.

18:51.873 --> 18:53.974
<i>Food fight!</i>

18:54.042 --> 18:55.810
<i>(students yelling)</i>

19:12.066 --> 19:12.076

19:13.874 --> 19:15.041
Ugh.

19:15.092 --> 19:16.425
ARTIE: I thought
slushies were bad,

19:16.510 --> 19:18.794
but spaghetti sauce in the eye
is so much worse.

19:18.862 --> 19:19.962
I have pepperoni
in my bra.

19:20.047 --> 19:21.714
Those are your nipples.

19:21.765 --> 19:23.766
Mr. Shue, if you are trying
to break us down

19:23.851 --> 19:25.268
to rebuild us,
it's working.

19:25.352 --> 19:26.919
Not one single person
was inspired

19:26.970 --> 19:29.388
by our hot lunch jam
to try out, Mr. Shue.

19:29.439 --> 19:30.589
GIRL:
It's true.

19:30.641 --> 19:32.058
You guys sucked ass.

19:33.610 --> 19:34.961
I'm sorry. And you are?

19:35.028 --> 19:36.229
I'm Sugar Motta.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.147
And I have self-diagnosed
Asperger's,

19:38.232 --> 19:40.483
so I can pretty much
say whatever I want.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.118
I'm like a diplomat's daughter.

19:42.202 --> 19:43.236
How can we
help you, Sugar?

19:43.287 --> 19:44.654
Here's the deal.

19:44.738 --> 19:46.989
I'm awesome, and I want
to be a big, big star.

19:47.074 --> 19:49.242
And when I saw you guys
singing and dancing

19:49.309 --> 19:50.743
in the cafeteria,
I thought,

19:50.794 --> 19:52.745
"I am so much
better than you."

19:52.796 --> 19:54.380
Sorry. Asperger's.

19:54.447 --> 19:55.798
Well, great.

19:55.883 --> 19:57.583
You see, guys?

19:57.634 --> 19:58.951
You have inspired
an audition.

19:59.002 --> 20:00.419
Good job.
(gloved applause)

20:00.470 --> 20:02.305
WILL: Sugar, why don't you
show us what you can do?

20:02.389 --> 20:05.057
You know, take your time.
Whenever you're ready.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.676
Sugar Motta.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.127
Why does that name
sound familiar?

20:08.178 --> 20:09.795
Oh, her daddy's
the rich dude

20:09.846 --> 20:11.480
that donated
the purple pianos.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.632
Get ready to taste
some sweet ear candy.

20:15.652 --> 20:16.986
Hit it, hottie.

20:17.070 --> 20:18.905
("Big Spender" begins)

20:26.813 --> 20:30.750
(outrageously off-key):
* The minute you walked
in the joint *

20:30.817 --> 20:34.387
* I could see you were
a man of distinction *

20:34.454 --> 20:37.206
* A real big spender *

20:37.291 --> 20:41.844
* Good-looking, so refined *

20:41.929 --> 20:45.548
* Wouldn't you like to know
what's going on in my mind? *

20:45.632 --> 20:48.050
Her ears should get to park
in my handicapped spot.

20:48.135 --> 20:50.002
* Hey, big spender *

20:50.070 --> 20:53.973
* Spend... oh *

20:54.024 --> 20:56.859
* A little time *

20:56.944 --> 21:01.063
* With me *

21:01.148 --> 21:03.482
* Yeah. *

21:03.533 --> 21:05.901
Holy sh... Sugar.

21:05.986 --> 21:07.653
Text me re:
our rehearsal "skedge."

21:07.704 --> 21:08.687
Of course.

21:08.789 --> 21:09.855
Mr. Shue, stop speaking.

21:09.906 --> 21:10.873
Okay.

21:10.958 --> 21:12.792
Uh, Sugar...

21:12.859 --> 21:14.043
we'll be in touch.

21:14.127 --> 21:15.328
Thank you. Bye.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.799
Okay, I think I speak
for everyone when I say--

21:19.883 --> 21:21.667
never gonna happen.

21:21.718 --> 21:24.036
Guys, I know she
was a little rough,

21:24.087 --> 21:25.704
but we have always
had the policy

21:25.756 --> 21:27.223
that anyone who tries out
gets in.

21:27.307 --> 21:28.557
You're not doing her any good

21:28.642 --> 21:29.976
sheltering Sugar
from the truth, okay?

21:30.043 --> 21:32.345
High school is where you learn
survival of the fittest.

21:32.429 --> 21:34.213
She's going to drag
the New Directions! down,

21:34.264 --> 21:35.547
and that's not fair
for those of us

21:35.599 --> 21:36.732
who don't want
to spend our lives

21:36.817 --> 21:38.217
rotting in this
insignificant town.

21:38.268 --> 21:39.735
You said
the other day

21:39.820 --> 21:41.570
that you would do anything
to get us to Nationals.

21:41.655 --> 21:42.989
Okay, and she
is going to keep us

21:43.056 --> 21:44.440
from winning that elusive crown.

21:44.524 --> 21:46.075
If anything, she's going to kill
all of our chances.

21:46.159 --> 21:47.943
(bell ringing)

21:48.028 --> 21:49.996
<i>WILL:
I just can't look a kid
in the eye and say,</i>

21:50.063 --> 21:51.864
"You're not good enough
to be in Glee Club."

21:51.915 --> 21:53.949
Was she that bad?

21:54.034 --> 21:57.586
Sugar Motta was just... awful.

21:57.671 --> 21:59.338
I mean, I have
never seen someone

21:59.406 --> 22:00.956
with so little musical talent.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.175
But that shouldn't have
anything to do with being

22:03.243 --> 22:04.743
a part of a club.

22:04.795 --> 22:06.962
So make her water boy or
mascot or something.

22:07.047 --> 22:08.764
That's what I do with
my hardest luck cases.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.000
You know how many guys
I cut last week? 60.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.501
And all of them
with big dreams.

22:12.569 --> 22:13.636
And I crushed 'em

22:13.720 --> 22:16.272
like pigs in a blanket.
(squealing)

22:16.356 --> 22:19.859
How? I mean, doesn't that
just eat you up?

22:19.926 --> 22:21.143
Of course.

22:21.228 --> 22:23.312
But it's my job to put
the guys I take

22:23.397 --> 22:24.947
in the best position to win.

22:25.032 --> 22:26.148
It's the same as you.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.267
The arts are different
than football.

22:28.318 --> 22:30.236
You win Nationals this year,

22:30.287 --> 22:33.572
you're buying that Glee Club
ten more years.

22:33.623 --> 22:35.157
EMMA:
Curve ball--

22:35.242 --> 22:37.076
so you just passed
"undecided"

22:37.127 --> 22:38.961
and "anyone white"
in the polls.

22:39.046 --> 22:41.580
It looks like our anti-arts
platform is actually working.

22:41.631 --> 22:42.998
Maybe I should rough
her up a little bit.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.950
<i>Go all Deliverance on
her or something, huh?</i>

22:45.052 --> 22:46.452
WILL:
No.

22:46.503 --> 22:48.454
This is my fight.

22:48.505 --> 22:50.589
It's my program
she wants to cut,

22:50.674 --> 22:52.058
and my kids.

22:52.125 --> 22:54.176
What are you going to do?

22:54.261 --> 22:56.829
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

22:58.298 --> 23:00.099
Sue wants to declare war
on the arts?

23:00.150 --> 23:04.070
Well, General Schuester is about
to launch a counteroffensive.

23:06.473 --> 23:09.575
So this is what being
turned on feels like.

23:09.642 --> 23:11.360
(bell rings)

23:11.445 --> 23:14.330
It all seems so hopelessly
provincial now.

23:14.414 --> 23:16.165
I mean, once you've
performed on the stage

23:16.249 --> 23:18.650
of the Gershwin Theatre and felt
the lights of Broadway

23:18.702 --> 23:21.253
on your face for
the first time...

23:21.321 --> 23:22.821
Nothing else compares.

23:22.873 --> 23:25.624
What's the purple piano
doing here?

23:25.675 --> 23:28.043
Well, I commandeered it

23:28.128 --> 23:30.662
to help us get ready
for our NYADA mixer.

23:30.714 --> 23:32.431
Whatever rejects show up
at that place,

23:32.499 --> 23:34.383
are gonna be
expecting

23:34.468 --> 23:35.551
Pepperidge Farm cookies
and punch,

23:35.635 --> 23:37.853
not Velma and Roxie.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.438
We need to intimidate
those wannabes

23:39.506 --> 23:41.307
into never wanting to audition
against us.
Genius!

23:42.692 --> 23:44.676
<i>Wicked again?
No.</i>

23:44.728 --> 23:46.862
<i>Before there was Wicked,
there was...</i>

23:46.947 --> 23:48.013
(gasps) Don't even
finish that sentence.

23:48.115 --> 23:49.615
Hit it!

23:49.682 --> 23:54.620
(jazz version of "Ding Dong!
the Witch is Dead" begins)

23:54.687 --> 23:59.291
* Once there was a wicked witch
in the lovely land of Oz *

23:59.359 --> 24:01.860
* And a wickeder, wickeder,
wickeder witch *

24:01.912 --> 24:04.363
* There never, ever was *

24:04.414 --> 24:06.865
* She filled the folks in
Munchkinland *

24:06.917 --> 24:09.701
* With terror and with dread *

24:09.753 --> 24:11.554
* Till one fine day
from Kansas *

24:11.638 --> 24:14.706
* A house fell on her head *

24:14.758 --> 24:18.227
* And the coroner
pronounced her... *

24:21.064 --> 24:22.064
* Dead *

24:22.149 --> 24:23.432
* And through the town *

24:23.517 --> 24:26.936
* The joyous news went runnin' *

24:27.020 --> 24:28.554
* The joyous news *

24:28.605 --> 24:31.607
* That the wicked old witch was
finally done in *

24:37.564 --> 24:39.915
* Ding-dong,
the Witch is dead *

24:40.000 --> 24:41.116
* Which old Witch? *

24:41.201 --> 24:42.084
* Well, uh,
the Wicked Witch! *

24:42.169 --> 24:43.452
* Oh *

24:43.537 --> 24:45.421
* Ding-dong,
the Wicked Witch is dead *

24:45.505 --> 24:47.540
* Oh, yeah, happy day *

24:47.591 --> 24:49.575
* Wake up,
you sleepy head *

24:49.626 --> 24:51.243
* Rub your eyes *

24:51.294 --> 24:52.678
* And get out of that bed *

24:52.745 --> 24:57.383
* Wake up, the Wicked
Witch is dead *

24:57.434 --> 25:00.302
* She's gone
where the goblins go *

25:00.387 --> 25:02.721
* Below, below, below *

25:02.772 --> 25:06.525
* Yo-ho,
let's open up and sing *

25:06.593 --> 25:07.776
* And ring those bells out *

25:07.861 --> 25:10.729
* Sing the news out *

25:10.780 --> 25:11.814

25:11.898 --> 25:14.033
* Ding-dong, the merry-oh *

25:14.100 --> 25:16.452
* Sing it high, sing it low *

25:16.536 --> 25:21.624
* Let them know the
Wicked ol' Witch is dead! *

25:21.708 --> 25:23.792
* Why, everyone's glad
she took such a crownin' *

25:23.877 --> 25:27.296
* Gettin' hit by a house is
even worse than drownin' *

25:27.380 --> 25:33.402
* Let 'em know the wicked
ol' Witch is dead! *

25:35.305 --> 25:36.722
(song ends)

25:36.789 --> 25:38.624
Those kids are never even
gonna know what hit them.

25:40.107 --> 25:40.117
+

25:41.244 --> 25:42.745
Ladies, the key to successful

25:42.829 --> 25:45.631
Cheerios! tryouts
is in brutal honesty.

25:45.698 --> 25:47.499
Actually, maybe just brutality,

25:47.567 --> 25:50.953
as I have no intention
of bringing anyone new in.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.122
I just basically want
to see people cry.

25:53.206 --> 25:53.905
Hit it!

25:54.958 --> 25:55.541
Terrible!

25:57.393 --> 25:58.761
What is wrong with you?

26:01.247 --> 26:02.514
Next.

26:02.582 --> 26:06.151
Well, well, well,
Wavy Gravy, Dr. Zaius.

26:06.219 --> 26:08.086
To what do I owe this pleasure?

26:08.138 --> 26:10.005
Candidate Sylvester,

26:10.073 --> 26:13.942
To what do I owe this pleasure?

26:14.027 --> 26:16.895
Every tiny grain of this glitter
represents a kid

26:16.963 --> 26:18.981
whose dream won't come
true if you get elected

26:19.065 --> 26:20.315
and end school
arts programs.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.617
John F. Kennedy once said,

26:21.701 --> 26:24.269
"The arts are the roots
of our culture."

26:24.320 --> 26:27.072
The arts enrich our lives
and help kids achieve

26:27.123 --> 26:28.773
in all walks of life.

26:28.825 --> 26:29.875
Sue Sylvester...

26:32.462 --> 26:34.246
...you just got glitter-bombed.

26:34.297 --> 26:35.164
You get that?
Mm-hmm.

26:35.248 --> 26:36.148
Okay, come on.
Come on.

26:37.834 --> 26:40.552
Becky, I need the two of you
to escort me

26:40.620 --> 26:44.122
to my hyperbaric chamber,
as I have glitter in my eyes.

26:46.176 --> 26:48.227
(bell rings)

26:51.264 --> 26:52.931
Hey, you.

26:52.982 --> 26:56.268
Well, aren't you
a sight for these sore eyes.

26:56.319 --> 26:58.103
Bad day?

26:58.154 --> 26:59.804
(sighing):
Bad week, more like it.

26:59.856 --> 27:01.473
Hey, what are you
doing here?

27:01.524 --> 27:03.192
Shouldn't you be
at Warbler practice?

27:03.276 --> 27:05.244
You know, putting
fine tuning touches

27:05.311 --> 27:06.945
on our new Katy Perry
showstopper?

27:06.996 --> 27:08.813
Okay, for someone who
loves clothes so much,

27:08.865 --> 27:10.365
I can't believe you
haven't noticed that

27:10.450 --> 27:11.783
I'm not in my
Warbler outfit.

27:11.835 --> 27:14.253
Wait, wait...

27:16.122 --> 27:18.323
(Kurt gasps, Blaine laughs)

27:18.374 --> 27:20.459
Wait-wait-- you didn't
do this for me, did you?

27:20.510 --> 27:22.010
Because if you
did this for me,

27:22.095 --> 27:23.462
I mean, it would be
very romantic for one,

27:23.513 --> 27:25.297
but it could lead to resentment,
which could lead to anger,

27:25.348 --> 27:26.849
which could lead to a horrible,
horrible, nasty breakup

27:26.933 --> 27:27.883
<i>like, you know,
on The Bachelorette,</i>

27:27.967 --> 27:29.101
when we watched that...

27:29.168 --> 27:30.669
Hey, I came here for me.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.273
Because I can't stand to be
apart from the person I love.

27:35.859 --> 27:38.143
Well, I guess we'll
just have to find a way

27:38.194 --> 27:40.028
to ease you into the
New Directions! now, huh?

27:40.113 --> 27:41.947
I've already have
that figured out.

27:42.014 --> 27:44.867
(Tom Jones'
"It's Not Unusual" begins)

27:53.359 --> 27:58.630
* It's not unusual
to be loved by anyone *

27:58.698 --> 28:03.368
* It's not unusual to have
fun with anyone *

28:03.419 --> 28:08.223
* But when I see you
hanging about with anyone *

28:08.308 --> 28:13.178
* It's not unusual
to see me cry *

28:13.229 --> 28:15.547
* I wanna die *

28:17.100 --> 28:21.886
* It's not unusual
to go out at any time *

28:21.938 --> 28:27.292
* But when I see you out and
about it's such a crime *

28:27.360 --> 28:32.197
* If you should ever want
to be loved by anyone *

28:32.248 --> 28:34.533
* It's not unusual *

28:34.584 --> 28:36.785
* It happens every day *

28:36.869 --> 28:40.088
* No matter what you say *

28:40.173 --> 28:44.909
* You find it happens
all the time *

28:44.961 --> 28:47.346
* Love will never do *

28:47.413 --> 28:50.215
* What you want it to *

28:50.266 --> 28:57.806
* Why can't this
crazy love be mine? *

29:08.201 --> 29:12.321
* It's not unusual
to be mad with anyone *

29:13.906 --> 29:19.578
* It's not unusual
to be sad with anyone *

29:19.629 --> 29:24.049
* But if I ever find that you've
changed at any time *

29:24.116 --> 29:29.120
* It's not unusual to find out
I'm in love with you *

29:29.172 --> 29:31.556
* Whoa-whoa-whoa,
oh-oh-oh *

29:31.624 --> 29:33.558
* Whoa-whoa, whoa-oh *

29:33.626 --> 29:38.063
* Whoa-whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh *

29:38.130 --> 29:39.765
* Whoa-whoa. *

29:42.101 --> 29:43.185
(song ends)

29:43.269 --> 29:44.236
(applause)

29:52.228 --> 29:52.238
+

29:53.000 --> 29:54.667
Okay, so you're gonna
set up the props,

29:54.752 --> 29:55.952
I'll plug in the boombox,

29:56.003 --> 29:57.253
and we'll launch
immediately into the number.

29:57.304 --> 29:58.555
Our somewhat-talented

29:58.622 --> 30:00.390
but sadly delusional
competition will just rip up

30:00.474 --> 30:02.291
their applications in
fits of jealous rage.

30:02.343 --> 30:03.676
And then they'll all
just melt away

30:03.761 --> 30:05.228
like the Wicked Witch
of the West herself!

30:05.295 --> 30:06.513
You know what?

30:06.597 --> 30:10.266
I kinda feel sorry
for them.
Me, too.

30:10.317 --> 30:11.684
(giggles)

30:20.811 --> 30:22.278
Hi, I'm Harmony.

30:22.329 --> 30:23.113
What's your name,
where are you from,

30:23.164 --> 30:24.664
and what are your credits?

30:24.749 --> 30:27.150
Well, I'm, I'm Rachel.
I'm Pendelton!
I'm Canada!

30:27.201 --> 30:28.501
I'm Gavroche, named after

30:28.586 --> 30:30.820
<i>ze feisty French street urchin
from Les Mis!</i>

30:30.871 --> 30:32.922
I know you totally recognize me.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.374
It's 'cause I'm
the Gerber baby.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.459
I've been acting since I was
a fetus... literally.

30:36.510 --> 30:38.628
<i>An ultrasound of me was
featured on Murder She Wrote.</i>

30:38.679 --> 30:40.296
I'm starring as Rizzo in
an all-male production

30:40.381 --> 30:42.098
<i>of Grease.
Welcome, welcome, welcome!</i>

30:42.166 --> 30:45.301
As my future husband Robert
Pattinson always says,

30:45.352 --> 30:47.003
"It's refreshing
to get new blood."

30:47.054 --> 30:48.271
Oh! New blood?

30:48.338 --> 30:49.606
We've been meeting here
each month

30:49.673 --> 30:51.641
since we were freshmen,
literally.

30:51.692 --> 30:55.178
Well, actually Kurt and I just
found out about this on Monday.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.013
But speaking of "refreshing,"
we've put together a number

30:57.064 --> 30:58.064
that we think
you guys...
Places!

30:59.700 --> 31:00.950
You're just in time
to see a little number

31:01.035 --> 31:02.318
we've been futzing
around with.

31:02.369 --> 31:04.788
Thank God there was a bar
mitzvah here on Saturday.

31:04.855 --> 31:07.073
And I convinced them
not to strike the stage.

31:07.158 --> 31:11.795
So sit back, relax,
and most importantly, enjoy.

31:11.862 --> 31:12.695
Thank you.

31:12.746 --> 31:13.797
Oh, my God...

31:13.864 --> 31:15.465
Just, just breathe
and smile, okay?

31:15.532 --> 31:17.717
Just 'cause they look
like us and act like us

31:17.802 --> 31:19.169
doesn't mean
they're better than us.

31:19.220 --> 31:20.837
("Anything Goes" begins)

31:20.888 --> 31:22.972
* Times have changed! *

31:25.209 --> 31:28.144
* And we've often rewound
the clock *

31:28.212 --> 31:30.730
* Since the Puritans got
a shock *

31:30.798 --> 31:34.484
* When they landed on
Plymouth Rock! *

31:34.551 --> 31:38.488
* If today *

31:38.555 --> 31:41.557
* Any shock
they should try to stem *

31:41.609 --> 31:44.911
* 'Stead of landing on
Plymouth Rock *

31:44.995 --> 31:51.167
* Plymouth Rock would
land on them! *

31:51.235 --> 31:53.236
* In olden days *

31:53.287 --> 31:55.872
* A glimpse of stocking *

31:55.923 --> 31:57.841
* Was looked on
as something shocking *

31:57.908 --> 32:00.076
* But now God knows *

32:00.127 --> 32:04.430
* Anything goes! *

32:04.515 --> 32:06.582
* Good authors, too,
who once knew better words *

32:06.684 --> 32:11.521
* Now only use four-letter words
writing prose *

32:11.588 --> 32:13.690
* Anything goes *

32:15.392 --> 32:17.944
* Anything you can be,
I can be greater *

32:18.028 --> 32:20.313
* Sooner or later,
I'm greater than you *

32:20.397 --> 32:21.731
<i>* No, you're not! *
* Yes, I am *</i>

32:21.782 --> 32:23.399

32:23.450 --> 32:25.902
<i>* No, you're not! *
* Yes, I am, yes, I am! *</i>

32:25.953 --> 32:29.038
(lively orchestral interlude)

(tap shoes clacking)

32:45.222 --> 32:48.174
* The world has gone mad today

<i>* Anything goes. *</i>

33:24.445 --> 33:29.165
I've never, I've never been
so humiliated in my life.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.550
Me, either.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.685
And that's a really high bar.

33:32.770 --> 33:35.939
I mean, they were so...

33:36.006 --> 33:37.557
Fabulous.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.192
(crying softly)

33:39.276 --> 33:41.444
Rachel, we might be
hot stuff at McKinley,

33:41.511 --> 33:44.981
but outside those walls,
we aren't even stuff.

33:45.065 --> 33:48.034
I mean, we've been
deluded and arrogant.

33:48.118 --> 33:49.352
(sobs)

33:49.403 --> 33:52.155
What if we're not
good enough to make it?

33:52.206 --> 33:54.023
No.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.742
There's only
one thing to do.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.027
(blows nose)
We just have to move
to another town

33:58.078 --> 33:59.879
and just erase
our identities

33:59.964 --> 34:01.547
and just resign to a sad life
of community theater.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.132
Don't say that.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.002
<i>Nun-Sense, Love Letters,
The Vagina Monologues.</i>

34:06.053 --> 34:07.971
Face it, I mean,
this is our future.

34:08.038 --> 34:11.056
Not everyone's
dreams come true.

34:11.141 --> 34:12.058
You know what?

34:12.141 --> 34:13.509
(sniffles)

34:13.560 --> 34:15.878
I'm ending this
pity party right now.

34:15.929 --> 34:17.429
Okay.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.315
Take a look at yourself.

34:19.382 --> 34:20.600
What do you see?

34:20.684 --> 34:23.069
Come on.

34:23.152 --> 34:25.103
Sad, puffy, red eyes

34:25.188 --> 34:28.024
filled with dashed
hopes and dreams.

34:28.074 --> 34:30.243
Rachel Berry.

34:30.327 --> 34:32.027
One of a kind.

34:32.079 --> 34:33.396
(thunder rumbling)
There's no one like you.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.114
Well, that's actually
kind of funny,

34:35.199 --> 34:36.866
because it seems
like there is.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.284
Okay, fine, so you've never been
in a high school production.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.621
<i>Or any production, because,
you know, Cabaret was canceled</i>

34:41.705 --> 34:43.039
<i>and so was Rocky Horror.</i>

34:43.123 --> 34:44.907
Mm-mm. They had
credits, Kurt.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.092
In utero credits.

34:46.176 --> 34:48.960
Okay, so they have
more experience.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.746
They have more talent.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.416
But you are fierce, Rachel.

34:53.467 --> 34:57.520
Your ambition does push-ups
while you sleep.

34:57.587 --> 34:59.972
Nobody wants it
more than you.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.924
Nobody.

35:04.428 --> 35:07.113
And you're not
giving up on this.

35:07.197 --> 35:09.482
'Cause I'm not gonna let you.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.367
You are getting
into that school.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.106
(sniffles)

35:17.157 --> 35:18.774
You make me want to
be your boyfriend.

35:18.826 --> 35:20.793
(chuckles)

35:20.911 --> 35:22.495
You're getting in, too.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.496
I know it.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.782
I doubt it.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.335
I'm woefully thin
on extracurriculars.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.304
It's not too late.

35:31.388 --> 35:33.556
I mean, you could, you know,
still sign up for some clubs.

35:33.623 --> 35:36.426
There's the student council.

35:36.477 --> 35:39.345
I'm not the only fierce one.

35:39.430 --> 35:41.981
(sniffles)

35:42.066 --> 35:44.484
Swear it.

35:44.568 --> 35:45.685
We're gonna do this.

35:57.831 --> 35:58.998
(both laugh)

35:59.083 --> 36:02.085
(sniffles, sighs)

36:02.152 --> 36:03.986
You realize we just did
the gay high-five.

36:04.037 --> 36:04.837
(laughs):
Yeah, we did.

36:06.009 --> 36:06.019
+

36:06.705 --> 36:08.072
(alarm beeping)

36:11.493 --> 36:14.728
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

36:14.780 --> 36:16.163
Come on.

36:19.668 --> 36:21.368
I don't want to go
to school today.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.003
I know.

36:23.071 --> 36:26.073
It's the right thing to do for
the club, the greater good.

36:26.124 --> 36:28.075
I just can't kill
a kid's dream.

36:28.126 --> 36:29.927
I can't do it.

36:30.011 --> 36:32.963
Will, you glitter-bombed Sue.

36:33.048 --> 36:36.851
This week, you stopped
being a man of words,

36:36.918 --> 36:39.136
and you became
a man of action.

36:39.221 --> 36:42.089
And it was super-hot.

36:46.862 --> 36:48.112
(bell ringing)

36:48.196 --> 36:49.613
Obviously your ears
are busted because

36:49.698 --> 36:51.031
I worked that song
like a hooker pole.

36:51.099 --> 36:52.266
It's no biggie.

36:52.317 --> 36:53.534
I'll come in and
I'll do it again.

36:53.601 --> 36:56.403
Sugar, I'm sorry...
you can't sing.

36:56.455 --> 36:57.955
The answer is no.

36:58.039 --> 36:59.290
But I love your enthusiasm,

36:59.374 --> 37:01.826
and I'd be so happy
to work with you so that...

37:01.910 --> 37:03.544
You know what?
Who cares what you think?

37:03.611 --> 37:05.663
Hmm? Nobody.

37:05.747 --> 37:07.281
You're a washed-up
Broadway wannabe

37:07.332 --> 37:08.782
who's stuck in Lima

37:08.834 --> 37:10.751
and has led the Glee Club
to how many National wins?

37:10.802 --> 37:12.520
Oh, I'm sorry, zero.

37:12.587 --> 37:15.422
Not Asperger's!

37:15.474 --> 37:18.642
SUE:
Nicely played, William.

37:18.727 --> 37:19.844
(chuckles)

37:19.928 --> 37:22.229
You know, I have to say,
I'm really enjoying

37:22.297 --> 37:24.932
this new stink of man marbles
wafting off of you this year.

37:24.983 --> 37:27.301
I did not enjoy
doing that, Sue.

37:27.352 --> 37:28.769
Oh, I'm not talking
about that.

37:28.820 --> 37:30.821
I'm talking about your little
pixie dust hate crime.

37:30.906 --> 37:33.274
You know, it took Becky
three hours to pick the glitter

37:33.325 --> 37:34.909
from my scalp
like a little chimp.

37:34.976 --> 37:36.026
Good.

37:36.111 --> 37:37.144
I hope it taught
you a lesson.

37:37.195 --> 37:38.329
It did, Will.

37:38.413 --> 37:40.998
It taught me that
everyone loves a martyr.

37:41.082 --> 37:43.751
The day after your little video
went up on YouTube,

37:43.818 --> 37:46.170
I went up seven points
in the polls.

37:46.254 --> 37:49.957
Turns out, your hate is a lot
like high-octane Sue-fluid.

37:50.008 --> 37:51.258
(snaps fingers)

37:51.326 --> 37:53.660
(bell ringing)

37:53.712 --> 37:56.764
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for

37:56.831 --> 37:57.848
Glee Club's newest member,

37:57.933 --> 37:59.016
Blaine Anderson.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.100
Thanks so much,
everyone.

38:00.168 --> 38:01.385
I'm so thrilled
to be here.

38:01.469 --> 38:03.170
It's gonna be a great year,
I can feel it.

38:03.221 --> 38:04.838
We're all gonna go
to Nationals.

38:04.890 --> 38:06.473
(cheering)
Yeah.

38:08.944 --> 38:11.028
Is there a problem, guys?

38:11.146 --> 38:14.514
I just want Blaine to know
that we're not the Warblers.

38:14.566 --> 38:17.451
You know, we're not into
the bells and whistles

38:17.518 --> 38:19.320
or the ball hogging, you know?

38:19.371 --> 38:21.121
I'm sorry, did I do
something wrong?

38:21.189 --> 38:23.657
Well, yeah, you set a bonfire
in our courtyard.

38:23.708 --> 38:26.460
Actually, Doorknob, that was
an act of political protest.

38:26.527 --> 38:29.163
Which leads me
to the next order of business.

38:29.214 --> 38:31.549
Santana, you need to leave.

38:31.633 --> 38:34.385
It was you and the Cheerios!
who set fire to our piano.

38:34.469 --> 38:35.302
How could you do that?

38:35.370 --> 38:37.004
Mr. Shue, Sue made me.

38:37.055 --> 38:38.088
Brittany didn't do it.

38:38.173 --> 38:39.473
Well, yeah, I was gonna help,

38:39.540 --> 38:41.508
but I don't know,
I'm a water sign, so...

38:42.677 --> 38:44.261
You're banned from Glee.

38:44.346 --> 38:46.897
Don't come back unless you can
be as loyal to this club

38:46.982 --> 38:48.766
as the rest of the people
in this room.

38:53.855 --> 38:55.072
You know what?

38:55.156 --> 38:56.223
I could use a break.

39:02.864 --> 39:04.231
You know, good for you,
Mr. Shue.

39:04.282 --> 39:07.284
It's about time we got
some allegiance up in here.

39:07.369 --> 39:09.336
I said it before
and I will say it again--

39:09.404 --> 39:12.206
we want to win Nationals
this year, we need to be united.

39:12.257 --> 39:13.540
Rachel, you had an announcement?

39:13.592 --> 39:15.793
Yeah.

39:15.877 --> 39:17.962
Um, after pushing the envelope
last year, I strongly believe

39:18.046 --> 39:19.380
that we should
secure the rights to

39:19.431 --> 39:20.931
a, shall we say,

39:21.016 --> 39:23.384
less controversial show
for our school musical.

39:23.435 --> 39:25.302
Wait for it.

39:25.387 --> 39:26.437
<i>West Side Story.</i>

39:26.521 --> 39:28.305
Is that the one with the cats?

39:28.390 --> 39:29.640
And it just so
happens to have

39:29.724 --> 39:30.941
a lead role that showcases

39:31.026 --> 39:33.160
my talent and essence perfectly:
Maria.

39:33.228 --> 39:34.094
MERCEDES:
For which there will be

39:34.145 --> 39:35.696
open auditions, right?

39:35.763 --> 39:38.532
Because Mercedes is feeling
extremely pretty this year.

39:38.599 --> 39:41.201
Kurt, you had
something, too, right?

39:41.269 --> 39:43.070
Kurt Hummel
is wading into

39:43.121 --> 39:45.605
McKinley High's shark-
infested political waters

39:45.657 --> 39:46.957
and ruing for senior
class president.

39:47.042 --> 39:49.209
All right, I thank you in
advance for your votes.

39:49.277 --> 39:50.327
Okay.

39:50.412 --> 39:52.997
So much excitement.
Now let's rehearse.

39:53.081 --> 39:56.016
Look at what they
did to us, Mr. Shue.

39:56.084 --> 39:58.602
Just like these purple pianos,
they ripped out our guts,

39:58.670 --> 40:01.221
threw crap all over
us and burned us up.

40:01.289 --> 40:04.808
Yeah.
We got hit pretty hard.

40:04.893 --> 40:06.760
But...

40:06.811 --> 40:09.513
(plays three notes)

40:09.597 --> 40:11.131
...these pianos
are still making music.

40:11.182 --> 40:13.300
And so are we.

40:13.351 --> 40:17.905
Mr. Shue, as always, you and I
are on the exact same page.

40:22.243 --> 40:24.194
(piano playing
"You Can't Stop the Beat")

40:24.279 --> 40:28.248
* You can't stop an avalanche *

40:28.316 --> 40:33.420
* As it races down the hill *

40:33.488 --> 40:37.174
* You can try
to stop the seasons *

40:37.258 --> 40:42.846
* But you know you never will *

40:42.931 --> 40:48.052
* And you can try
to stop my dancing feet *

40:48.136 --> 40:52.022
* But I just cannot
stand still *

40:52.107 --> 40:57.194
* 'Cause the world keeps
spinning round and round *

40:57.278 --> 41:02.783
* And my heart's keeping time
to the speed of sound *

41:02.850 --> 41:04.902
* I was lost
till I heard the drums *

41:04.986 --> 41:09.206
* Then I found my way *

41:09.290 --> 41:14.294
* 'Cause you can't
stop the beat *

41:14.362 --> 41:16.029
Five, six, seven, eight!

41:16.081 --> 41:18.532
* Ever since
this old world began *

41:18.583 --> 41:21.802
* A woman found out if she shook
it, she could shake up a man *

41:21.869 --> 41:23.170
* And so I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it *

41:23.221 --> 41:25.973
* The best that I can today *

41:26.040 --> 41:27.541
* 'Cause you can't stop *

41:27.592 --> 41:29.643
* The motion of the ocean
or the sun in the sky *

41:29.710 --> 41:32.646
* You can wonder if you wanna,
but I never ask why *

41:32.713 --> 41:34.381
* If you try to hold me down *

41:34.432 --> 41:37.067
* I'm gonna spit
in your eye and say *

41:37.152 --> 41:39.386
* That you can't stop the beat *

41:46.945 --> 41:48.779
<i>* You can't stop today *
* No *</i>

41:48.863 --> 41:51.615
* As it comes
speeding down the track *

41:51.699 --> 41:53.200
<i>* Ooh, child, yeah *</i>

41:53.251 --> 41:55.252
<i>* Child, yesterday is history *
* Be gone *</i>

41:55.336 --> 41:58.288
* And it's never coming back *

41:58.373 --> 42:01.341
* 'Cause tomorrow is
a brand-new day *

42:01.409 --> 42:03.743
<i>* And it don't know
white from black *
* Yeah *</i>

42:03.795 --> 42:06.213
* 'Cause the world keeps
spinning round and round *

42:06.264 --> 42:08.766
* And my heart's keeping time
to the speed of sound *

42:08.850 --> 42:13.804
* I was lost till I heard
the drums, then I found my way *

42:13.888 --> 42:15.922
* 'Cause you can't
stop the beat *

42:15.974 --> 42:18.358
<i>* Oh, oh, oh *</i>

42:18.426 --> 42:21.094
<i>* Oh, oh, oh, oh *</i>

42:21.146 --> 42:23.564
* Ever since we first
saw the sun *

42:23.615 --> 42:26.533
* A man and woman like to shake
it when the day is done *

42:26.601 --> 42:27.985
* So I'm gonna
shake and shimmy it *

42:28.069 --> 42:30.770
* And have some fun today *

42:30.822 --> 42:32.289
* 'Cause you can't stop *

42:32.373 --> 42:34.491
* The motion of the ocean
or the rain from above *

42:34.576 --> 42:37.161
* You can try to stop
the paradise we're dreaming of *

42:37.245 --> 42:41.965
* But you cannot stop the rhythm
of two hearts in love to stay *

42:42.050 --> 42:43.383
* You can't stop the beat *

42:43.451 --> 42:45.085
