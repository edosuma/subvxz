00:33.333 --> 00:35.167
WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:35.267 --> 00:37.733
ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:37.833 --> 00:39.767
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.767
-THE CITY OF KANSAS CITY
IS A REALLY COOL PLACE.

00:43.867 --> 00:45.367
IT'S GOT A VARIETY
OF PEOPLE.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.933
WE HAVE OUR HIGH CRIME AREAS,
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT
OF NICE AREAS.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.867
THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF
AN ODD SPRING.

00:49.967 --> 00:54.033
LAST MONTH WE HAD 26 DAYS
OF RAIN OUT OF 31 DAYS
IN THE MONTH.

00:54.133 --> 00:58.067
SO, IT'S BEEN KINDA HARD
TO GET OUT AND DO
PROACTIVE POLICING.

00:58.167 --> 01:01.667
-WE JUST HAD A WHITE
4-DOOR VEHICLE LEAVE ONE OF
OUR KNOWN METH HOUSES UP HERE.

01:01.767 --> 01:04.700
WE'RE GONNA TRY TO PULL IT OVER
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
THEM TONIGHT.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.133
(radio chatter)

01:08.233 --> 01:09.600
-HE DIDN'T EVEN STOP, DUDE.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.733
(sirens blare)
-WE GOT A VEHICLE, 10-55,

01:11.833 --> 01:13.833
HE JUST ROLLED RIGHT THROUGH
A STOP SIGN. DIDN'T EVEN STOP.

01:13.933 --> 01:20.333
HE'S HEADING SOUTHBOUND NOW
ON HARDESTY APPROACHING
INDEPENDENCE AVENUE.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.500
IT'S A WHITE MITSUBISHI.
-HE'S DOING 40.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.067
-LIKE, HATCHBACK.
-HE'S DOING 40 MILES AN HOUR.

01:25.100 --> 01:29.500
-I'M ASSUMING HE'S GONNA TAKE
THE SOUTH LOOP. I'LL LET YOU
KNOW HERE IN A SEC THOUGH.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.467
(radio chatter)

01:33.567 --> 01:36.933
UH, IT'S A POSSIBLE INTOXICATED
AND/OR HIGH DRIVER

01:37.067 --> 01:41.800
LEAVING ONE OF OUR KNOWN
ADDRESSES THAT THEY USE
METH THERE

01:41.900 --> 01:43.800
AND HAVE PARTIES.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.700
NOPE. HE WENT I-70 WESTBOUND,
THOUGH, MA'AM.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.467
HE'LL BE COMING UP
TO THE PROSPECT EXIT ON I-70.

01:50.567 --> 01:54.133
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GONNA
CONTINUE WEST ONTO I-70.

01:54.233 --> 01:57.967
-DUDE, IT'S SO SLICK,
I CAN'T GO MUCH FASTER.

01:58.067 --> 02:00.467
(thunder rumbles)
(laughing)

02:00.567 --> 02:01.733
-OH, MY GOD.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.133
-DUDE, IT'S SERIOUS.

02:04.233 --> 02:06.633
-SARGE, WE'RE GONNA DISREGARD
BECAUSE OF RAIN, OURSELVES.

02:06.733 --> 02:08.367
WE HAVE TERMINATED
OUR PURSUIT.

02:08.467 --> 02:09.533
-OH, HE HIT SOMETHING!

02:09.633 --> 02:11.667
HE HIT SOMETHING.
HE'S PULLING OVER, DUDE.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.067
-THIS CAR IS COMING
TO A COMPLETE STOP.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.433
CENTRAL AVENUE, DISPATCH.

02:16.533 --> 02:19.833
-WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO
A FELONY CAR CHECK ON IT.
CAN YOU GET KANSAS HERE?

02:19.933 --> 02:21.833
-DRIVER, TURN THE CAR OFF!

02:21.933 --> 02:23.433
-HE AIN'T GONNA HEAR YOU.
(siren blares)

02:23.533 --> 02:26.767
PLEASE, NOTIFY KANSAS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS CAR
IS DISABLED, OR WHAT.

02:26.867 --> 02:28.567
-I THINK HIS CAR IS SMOKING.

02:28.667 --> 02:29.933
TURN THE CAR OFF!

02:30.067 --> 02:31.300
(engine revs)

02:31.400 --> 02:35.067
EH. THE ENGINE'S ALL SMOKY
AND HE CAN'T GO MUCH FURTHER.

02:35.167 --> 02:37.300
BUT NOW THEY'RE TAKING OFF
AGAIN AT 10 MILES AN HOUR.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.967
-I THINK HE HIT THE SIDE.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.633
YOU CAN CLEAR IT.
HE TOOK OFF AGAIN, DISPATCH.

02:40.733 --> 02:43.100
-WE'RE NOT GONNA PURSUE IT
'CAUSE OF THE WEATHER.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.367
WE ARE NOT GONNA PURSUE
THIS VEHICLE.

02:45.467 --> 02:47.233
-I'M NOT SURE WHERE
THE NEXT EXIT IS, SARGE,

02:47.333 --> 02:49.800
BUT HE'S DOING ABOUT
THREE MILES AN HOUR
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.433
IS HE PULLING OVER?
-I DON'T KNOW.

02:52.533 --> 02:55.400
-HEY, 21-31, HE JUST STOPPED
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE HIGHWAY.

02:58.700 --> 03:04.067
(sirens blare)

03:04.167 --> 03:05.733
-HE'S PROBABLY TWEAKED OUT.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.600
-ENGINE'S SMOKING.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.867
-THEY'RE-- SHE'S TRYING--

03:09.967 --> 03:11.233
TURN THE CAR OFF!

03:11.333 --> 03:13.067
DRIVER, TURN THE CAR OFF!

03:13.100 --> 03:15.133

03:24.700 --> 03:27.067
-GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!

03:27.100 --> 03:32.100
-(yelling and screaming)

03:32.200 --> 03:33.533
-HOLD IT!

03:33.633 --> 03:35.933

03:36.067 --> 03:38.733

-OKAY, OKAY.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.200

MANOS ESPALDA!

03:44.800 --> 03:47.067
MANOS EN LA ESPALDA!

03:47.133 --> 03:49.600
-ALL RIGHT, LET'S BRING
THAT OTHER HAND UP, BOYS.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.200
ALL RIGHT, READY?
YOU READY?

03:54.300 --> 03:56.600
-WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

03:56.700 --> 03:58.500
HE COULD HAVE FOUND
A BETTER SPOT TO PARK.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.667
-YEAH, MAN.

03:59.767 --> 04:03.600
-(yelling in Spanish)

04:03.700 --> 04:05.133
-HAVE A SEAT RIGHT HERE
ON THE GROUND.

04:05.233 --> 04:06.300
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN!

04:06.400 --> 04:08.267
-I CAN'T WALK!

04:08.367 --> 04:14.500
(crying and screaming)

04:14.600 --> 04:16.067
-WE GOT AN AMBULANCE
COMING, OKAY?

04:16.133 --> 04:17.633
-NICE AND EASY, COME ON.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.467
GET IN THERE. GET IN THERE.

04:19.567 --> 04:22.533
(screaming continues)

04:22.633 --> 04:24.067
-COME ON, STAND UP FOR ME.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.300
(fire horn honks)

04:25.400 --> 04:26.367
-HERE'S THE AMBULANCE.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.733
-GOTTA DO WHAT
WE TELL YOU TO DO.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.333
IF WE TELL YOU TO GET OUT
OF THE CAR, YOU GOTTA GET OUT.

04:29.433 --> 04:31.833
-I WAS TELLING THEM TO HOLD ON,
THEY COULDN'T HOLD ON.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.700
-YOU CAN'T HOLD ON.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.767
-DRIVER AND PASSENGER
WERE MAKING OUT.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.667
THEY WEREN'T GONNA LISTEN
TO OUR VERBAL COMMANDS TO GET
OUT OF THE CAR.

04:40.767 --> 04:44.400
SO, A COUPLE OFFICERS BUSTED
OUT THAT WINDOW TRYING TO
GET IN.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.100
THEY STILL REFUSED TO GET OUT.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.867
WE HAD TO PULL THEM OUT
AND TAKE THEM INTO CUSTODY.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.600
-HE'S GOT A HOLSTER
AND BULLETS ON HIM.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.933
-WE NEED TO GET THAT GUN.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.433
-WELL, THE GUN'S NOT
IN THE CAR.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.100
-BUT HE HAD THE BULLETS
AND HOLSTER ON HIM?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.600
-BULLETS LEFT POCKET,
HE HAD THE HOLSTER
IN HIS RIGHT POCKET.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.633
WE'RE LIKE, "WHERE'S THE GUN?"
HE'S LIKE, " NO PISTOLA. "

04:58.733 --> 05:00.400
SO, WE DON'T KNOW IF
HE DITCHED IT ON THE HIGHWAY

05:00.500 --> 05:02.200
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE,
OR ACTUALLY THREW IT ON
A LEDGE,

05:02.300 --> 05:04.700
'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF
GREAT PLACES TO DITCH WHATEVER
YOU WANT DITCHED

05:04.800 --> 05:06.233
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
COPS TO FIND.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.433
-SHOULD WE TRY
TO ASK THE GIRL?

05:08.533 --> 05:10.700
HEY, YOU OKAY?
HEY, SISTER, LISTEN TO ME.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.767
LISTEN, OKAY, HERE'S
THE DEAL.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.300
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JAIL,
SO THAT'S OKAY.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.433
HE'S GOT BULLETS
AND A HOLSTER ON HIM.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.567
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY
TO PICK THIS GUN UP
IF YOU THREW IT OUT.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.767
-THEY WON'T.
-THEY WON'T?

05:20.867 --> 05:22.233
WHERE IS IT?
-NO, THEY WON'T.

05:22.333 --> 05:24.667
-WHERE IS IT?
-THEY LEFT IT IN THE CAR.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.300
-WHERE AT IN THE CAR?

05:26.400 --> 05:28.467
-THEY LEFT THE BULLETS...

05:28.567 --> 05:30.800
AND WHATEVER YOU SAY
IN THE CAR.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.267
-IN THAT CAR?

05:32.367 --> 05:34.367
-WHERE'S IT--
WHERE'S IT AT IN THE CAR?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.233
-IT'S NOT IN THE CAR.
-YOU JUST SAID
IT WAS IN THE CAR.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.500
-I'M SAYING THE BULLETS.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.533
-NO, HE HAD THE BULLETS
IN HIS POCKET.

05:39.633 --> 05:41.967
WHERE IS THE GUN?

05:42.067 --> 05:43.633
WHERE IS IT?

05:43.733 --> 05:45.200
WHERE'S IT AT IN THE CAR?

05:45.300 --> 05:47.700
ALL RIGHT.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.967
HEY.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.900
SHE WAS INTIMATING
IT WAS IN THE CAR.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.567
NOW, SHE'S BACKTRACKING.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
-I'M SURE HE THREW IT
OUT THE WINDOW.

05:54.667 --> 05:55.867
-YEAH.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.833
-GOT IT! WE GOT IT.
WE FOUND IT.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.533
-IT'S GONNA BE LOADED.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.567
HE TOOK OUT THE CD PLAYER,

06:02.667 --> 06:03.833
AND STUCK IT UP
UNDERNEATH THERE,

06:03.933 --> 06:05.567
SO I HAD TO PULL THAT OUT.
-GOOD JOB, MAN.

06:05.667 --> 06:09.267
-JUST ARTICULATE IN YOUR REPORT
THE CONDITION OF THE WEAPON
WHEN THEY FOUND IT.

06:09.367 --> 06:11.367
WHO FOUND IT,
WHERE THEY FOUND IT.
-OKAY.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.600
-On Radio:  WE'RE CLEAR AGAIN.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.267
-YEAH, THE BULLETS MATCH
THE BULLETS THAT WERE
IN HIS POCKET.

06:16.367 --> 06:17.300
-DO THEY?
-YUP.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.833
-HEY, THAT'S YOUR GUN, RIGHT?

06:18.933 --> 06:20.300
CUANTOS BEBIDAS?
-HUH?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.967
-CUANTOS CERVEZAS BEBIDAS?

06:22.067 --> 06:27.233
(both talking in Spanish)

06:27.333 --> 06:28.267
-MARIJUANA?
-YEAH.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.600
-OKAY.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.433
ALL RIGHT, 'CAUSE YOUR EYES,
YOUR  OJOS ARE  ROJO.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.200
-(speaks Spanish)
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.567
-YOU'RE BEING PLACED UNDER
ARREST FOR FELONY ELUDING
FOR THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.100
YOU ALSO GOT STUFF
IN KANSAS, OKAY?

06:40.200 --> 06:42.133
THAT WORKED OUT GOOD.
-YEAH, IT WORKED OUT GREAT.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.700
COULD HAVE ALSO JUMPED OUT
OF THE CAR WITH THAT GUN
AND SHOT IT OUT.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.133
-AND THEN WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM.
-YEAH.

06:47.233 --> 06:50.433
-HE DRIVES OFF AT 15 MILES
AN HOUR IN A COMPLETE DOWNPOUR.

06:50.533 --> 06:52.800
-DID YOU NOTICE THAT HE ACTED
LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WE WERE THERE?

06:52.900 --> 06:55.433
THEN WHEN WE STARTED YELLING,
HE LOOKED AND HE WAS STARTLED.

06:55.533 --> 06:56.933
HE LOOKED UP,
AND HE TOOK OFF AGAIN.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.733
-WEIRD, THE POLICE
ARE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
-YEAH, THAT'S WEIRD.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.733
-THAT WERE JUST PURSUING YOU.
-THAT WERE JUST CHASING YOU.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.067
THAT'S PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST
CAR CHASE I'VE EVER BEEN IN.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.767
-BUT IT ENDED WELL,
EVERYONE'S FINE.

07:04.867 --> 07:06.767
-WE GOT A GUN OFF THE STREET.
-ABSOLUTELY.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.233
-WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT
WORKING FOR A DIRECTED
PATROL UNIT

07:11.333 --> 07:13.133
IS OUR CAMARADERIE.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.967
WE ALL WORK AS A UNIT.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.833
THERE'S TEN OF US.
EVERYWHERE WE GO,

07:16.933 --> 07:18.867
THE WHOLE TEN OF US GO.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.167
SO, WE KINDA KNOW WHAT
EACH OTHER'S GONNA DO.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.600
THERE'S A LOT OF TRUST
ON THE UNIT,

07:22.700 --> 07:26.167
KNOWING THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

07:26.267 --> 07:31.133
THIS MOPED'S MADE
SEVERAL TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

07:31.233 --> 07:34.400
INITIATE A TRAFFIC STOP
AND TALK TO HIM.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.400
BLACK MALE OCCUPANT.

07:42.467 --> 07:43.633
HOW YOU DOING?

07:44.667 --> 07:46.067
REASON I'M STOPPING YOU--

07:46.133 --> 07:47.167
WHAT'CHU GOT?

07:47.267 --> 07:48.200
-I GOT THE BEER.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.333
-IS IT OPEN?

07:49.433 --> 07:50.767
-NO.

07:50.867 --> 07:51.833
I JUST BOUGHT IT.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.267
-YOU'RE GOOD.

07:53.367 --> 07:56.267
THE REASON I STOPPED YOU,
YOU MADE SEVERAL
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS.

07:56.367 --> 07:59.467
YOU WENT FROM THE STRAIGHT
HAND LANE AND MADE THAT
RIGHT HAND TURN.

07:59.567 --> 08:03.167
THEN YOU WEAVED IN AND OUT
OF THIS LANE A BUNCH OF TIMES
WITHOUT SIGNALING.

08:03.267 --> 08:04.467
YOU ALL RIGHT TO DRIVE?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.067
-YES, SIR.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.867
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR I.D.
OR SOMETHING ON YOU?

08:07.967 --> 08:09.067
-YES, SIR.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.667
IS THIS YOUR MOPED?
-YES, SIR.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.267
-COMING FROM THE SPINX?
-YES, SIR.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.067
-WHAT MADE YOU GO

08:21.167 --> 08:22.367
-WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD

08:22.467 --> 08:23.633
-COMING OUT OF THE APARTMENTS?

08:23.733 --> 08:25.433
-YES, SIR.
I USED TO LIVE OVER THERE.

08:25.533 --> 08:28.100
-OKAY. SO, YOU'RE NOT

08:28.200 --> 08:30.667
-YEAH, I WAS COMING
FROM THE SPINX.

08:34.067 --> 08:35.933
-BUT YOU SAID YOU WAS
COMING FROM THE APARTMENTS?

08:36.067 --> 08:37.967
-NO, SIR, I WASN'T COMING

08:38.067 --> 08:39.733

08:39.833 --> 08:42.767
-I SAID, I JUST LEFT
THE SPINX...
-YEAH.

08:42.867 --> 08:44.167
-AND I CAME THROUGH
THE APARTMENTS.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.467
-RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.067
WHAT WAS THE REASON
IN THERE?

08:48.967 --> 08:51.300
-UH, I WAS JUST RIDING, SIR.
-JUST RIDING?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.833

I LIVE RIGHT DOWN HERE.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.933
MY ADDRESS IS RIGHT
THERE, SIR.
-OKAY.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.867
TRYING TO DETERMINE WHY
YOU WENT THROUGH THERE.

08:57.967 --> 08:59.333
LOT OF DRUGS BEING SOLD
OUT OF THERE.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.067
-I DON'T--
-ILLEGAL STUFF
GOING ON IN THERE.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.333

09:03.433 --> 09:06.167

09:06.267 --> 09:07.967

09:10.700 --> 09:13.567
-HE LIED ABOUT COMING OUT

09:13.667 --> 09:16.467
BUNCH OF PRIORS. DOPE AND STUFF.

09:16.567 --> 09:17.900
NOTHING ACTIVE.

09:18.067 --> 09:20.067
DEFINITELY PRIOR NARCOTICS.

09:20.100 --> 09:25.333
A COUPLE PRIOR VIOLENT
CRIME TYPE STUFF.

09:25.433 --> 09:27.633
RESISTING ARREST,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.500
(radio chatter)

09:32.567 --> 09:34.433
-CAN YOU STEP OFF YOUR MOPED
REAL QUICK?

09:38.500 --> 09:39.800
STEP BACK HERE FOR ME,
REAL QUICK.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.500
YOU CAN LEAVE THAT.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.167

09:43.267 --> 09:44.833
KEYS ARE FINE.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.833
ANYTHING ILLEGAL ON YOU, JOHN?
-NO, SIR.

09:46.933 --> 09:48.367

09:49.700 --> 09:51.567
-NO, SIR, I...
-CAN YOU FACE THAT WAY

09:51.667 --> 09:52.967

I'M NOT SEARCHING YOU, OKAY?

09:57.767 --> 09:59.433
-HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE
NO REGISTRATION--

09:59.533 --> 10:02.100
-I'M NOT SEARCHING YOU, SIR.
I'M MAKING SURE YOU DON'T

10:04.833 --> 10:06.067
WHAT IS THIS?

10:06.167 --> 10:07.933
-OH, THAT?
THAT'S NOTHING BUT A BAG.

10:10.167 --> 10:12.100
WHOA, WHOA!
-BRING YOUR HANDS BACK.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.700
DON'T RESIST.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.767
RELAX.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.900

10:24.733 --> 10:26.100

10:26.200 --> 10:27.767
-DO NOT PULL AWAY!

10:27.867 --> 10:29.100

10:30.667 --> 10:32.467
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, ALL RIGHT?

10:32.567 --> 10:34.267

10:37.533 --> 10:40.133
ANYTHING ELSE ILLEGAL ON YOU?

10:40.233 --> 10:42.967
SIR, ANYTHING ELSE
ILLEGAL ON YOU?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.567
GOD ALMIGHTY.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.567
GUN.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.267
NOT VERY SMART, IS IT?

10:50.367 --> 10:52.600
TO RESIST WITH A GUN
ON YOUR WAIST?

10:52.700 --> 10:54.367
SOME CRACK COCAINE.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.767
-THERE WE GO.

10:56.867 --> 10:58.700
-HE HAD A GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.733
ALL KIND OF DOPE.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.933
ALL RIGHT, WE GON' STAND
YOU UP, ALL RIGHT?

11:03.067 --> 11:04.500
PULL YOUR KNEES IN.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
-I GOT A BLUETOOTH
ON MY EAR, RIGHT?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.533
IS IT ON MY EAR?

11:08.633 --> 11:10.100
MY BLUETOOTH?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.100
-IT'S NOT ON YOUR EAR, DUDE.
WE'LL FIND IT, ALL RIGHT?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.833
-IT SHOULD BE SITTING
RIGHT HERE.

11:13.933 --> 11:15.533
-DO YOU HEAR ME?
-WE'RE GON' FIND IT.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.167
-I HAD A BLUETOOTH
ON MY EAR, MAN.
-I HEARD YOU.

11:17.267 --> 11:19.367
COME ON UP.

11:19.467 --> 11:20.800
STEP BACK HERE.

11:20.900 --> 11:21.967
-GET MY WALLET
AND MY CIGARETTES.

11:22.067 --> 11:24.333
-WE'RE GONNA GET IT, MAN.
COME ON.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.900
ALL RIGHT, MAN. STEP IN.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.333
YEAH, HE WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS.

11:32.433 --> 11:36.467
YOU COULD TELL, HE KEPT WANTING
TO TALK ABOUT HIS BEER. BUT HIS
BEER IS PERFECTLY LEGAL.

11:36.567 --> 11:41.233
HE WAS COMING FROM AN AREA
WE KNOW TO HAVE A HIGH
CONCENTRATION OF NARCOTIC SALES.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.100
HE LIED ABOUT
WHERE HE CAME FROM.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.400
HE SAID HE WAS COMING FROM
THE STORE,

11:44.500 --> 11:46.833
BUT WE SAW HIM COME OUT OF
THE APARTMENT COMPLEX.

11:46.933 --> 11:50.200
ALL INDICATORS OF SOME TYPE
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.600
HE REFUSED TO CONSENT
THE SEARCH.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.567
SO, I WENT TO PAT DOWN
FOR JUST WEAPONS,

11:54.667 --> 11:59.167
AND FELT WHAT I KNEW
IMMEDIATELY TO BE THIS
PACKAGE OF MARIJUANA.

11:59.267 --> 12:01.867
I WENT TO PUT HIM IN HANDCUFFS,
PLACE HIM UNDER ARREST,

12:01.967 --> 12:04.667
HE JUST STARTED PULLING AWAY,
SO WE TOOK HIM TO THE GROUND.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.300
FOUND THIS LOADED .22 PISTOL
IN HIS WAISTBAND.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.400
YEAH, WITH ONE IN THE CHAMBER,
ALL IT WAS WAS HAVING TO PULL
THE TRIGGER TO SHOOT.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.800
I MEAN, HE COULD HAVE DONE THAT
IN ONE QUICK MOTION.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.333
SAY AGAIN?

12:17.433 --> 12:19.267
-Radio:
HYDROCODONE, SCHEDULE II.

12:19.367 --> 12:23.467
-YEAH, THESE ARE HYDROCODONE,
WHICH IS SCHEDULE II
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.

12:23.567 --> 12:26.700
HE'S GONNA BE CHARGED WITH
UNLAWFUL CARRYING OF A PISTOL.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.800
POSSESSION, PROBABLY WITH
INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE
SCHEDULE II,

12:29.900 --> 12:31.300
WHICH IS HYDROCODONE.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.400
UH, POSSESSION OF CRACK-COCAINE.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.233
AND PROBABLY POSSESSION
WITH INTENT TO SELL MARIJUANA.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.900
WHERE WERE YOU JUST COMING FROM?

12:39.067 --> 12:40.167
IT WASN'T THE SPINX, WAS IT?

12:40.267 --> 12:42.633
-I JUST BOUGHT THE BEER
THERE, SIR.
-YOU DID?

12:42.733 --> 12:43.700
OKAY.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.933
IS IT YOUR MOPED?

12:45.067 --> 12:46.400
-YES.
-ALL RIGHT.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.267
UM, ARE YOU A CONVICTED FELON?

12:49.367 --> 12:50.667
-YES.

12:50.767 --> 12:53.567
-FOR WHAT KIND
OF CONVICTIONS?

12:53.667 --> 12:55.833
ANYTHING VIOLENT?

12:58.067 --> 12:59.867
YES?

13:00.067 --> 13:03.300
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
RESISTING WITH THAT GUN, MAN?

13:03.400 --> 13:04.767
-RESISTING?

13:04.867 --> 13:06.767
-YEAH, LIKE PULLING AWAY
FROM US WHEN YOU HAD
A GUN IN YOUR WAIST.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.933
-DID I EVER RESIST YOU
AT ANY TIME, MAN?
-YOU DID.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.533
-NO, MAN, IT'S--
-YOU PULLED AWAY
FROM US.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.300
YOU DONE?

13:13.400 --> 13:16.667
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK?

13:16.767 --> 13:18.833
ALL RIGHT.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.833
HE'S FACING ABOUT
FIVE FELONY CHARGES.

13:21.933 --> 13:24.300
WHEN HE'S ON THE GROUND
WE JUST GOT ALL THIS
OFF OF HIM,

13:24.400 --> 13:26.500
AND THE ONE CONCERN
WAS HIS BLUETOOTH.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.700
I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT BIGGER
THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THAN
A $20 BLUETOOTH.

13:32.833 --> 13:36.267
-I WOULD SAY NOTHING SURPRISES
ME THESE DAYS.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.400
THERE ARE THOSE MOMENTS
THAT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE,

13:38.500 --> 13:40.767
WHAT WERE YOU
POSSIBLY THINKING?

13:40.867 --> 13:42.733
IT'S A VERY INTRIGUING PROCESS.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.600
I LIKE TEARING THAT APART
AND FINDING OUT, YOU KNOW,

13:44.700 --> 13:47.067
GETTING TO THE ROOT
OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON.

13:47.133 --> 13:50.100
I LOVE THE STREET INVESTIGATION.

13:51.967 --> 13:55.300
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO THIS GUY.
HE'S WALKING ON A REALLY
DARK STREET.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.967
AND HE'S OUT OF PLACE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM OVER
HERE BEFORE.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.467
HOW YOU DOING, BUD?
WHERE WE HEADING TO TONIGHT?

14:04.567 --> 14:05.867
-GOING TO MY UNCLE'S HOUSE.

14:05.967 --> 14:06.933
-WHERE DOES UNCLE STAY?

14:07.067 --> 14:08.867
-END OF THE STREET
AND TO THE LEFT.

14:08.967 --> 14:09.900
-HE STAYS WHERE?

14:10.067 --> 14:11.733
-DOWN RICHMOND TO THE LEFT.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.133

-YOUR CLOTHES?
-UH-HUH.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.800
-HOW LONG YOU PLANNING

14:30.100 --> 14:31.433
-KINDA DOWN ON
YOUR LUCK?

14:31.533 --> 14:33.233
NO I.D. ON YOU? NO?

14:33.333 --> 14:36.867
IT'S NOT TOO WARM
AND YOU'RE SWEATING
RATHER HEAVILY.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.767
DO YOU NORMALLY SWEAT...

14:38.867 --> 14:40.067
-YEAH, I HAVE
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.567
I'M A DIABETIC, AS WELL.
-OKAY.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.800

-YES, SIR.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.400
-OKAY, WHAT'S THE FIRST NAME

14:45.500 --> 14:47.533

...'55.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.367
-AND THE I.D. IS OUT
OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA?

15:02.467 --> 15:05.100
-NO, IT'S IN GEORGIA.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
-YOU GAVE ME A NEGATIVE
AND A POSITIVE RESPONSE.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.167
YOUR I.D. IS ISSUED TO YOU
BY THE STATE OF GEORGIA?
-YES, SIR.

15:10.267 --> 15:12.667
-OKAY. IS IT I.D. ONLY,
OR DRIVER'S LICENSE?

15:12.767 --> 15:14.200
-IT'S I.D.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.733
-ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU ON
PROBATION OR PAROLE, RANDALL?
-NO, SIR.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.767
-NO?
-NO.

15:16.867 --> 15:18.433
-YOU EVER BEEN LOCKED UP?
-NO, SIR.

15:18.533 --> 15:19.900
-YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN ARRESTED, EVER?

15:20.067 --> 15:21.800
-I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
ARRESTED, BUT...

15:21.900 --> 15:25.167
BUT NOT-- FOR PETTY (bleep).
-OKAY.

15:25.267 --> 15:26.267
NOT FOR PETTY--

15:26.367 --> 15:27.533
-I SAID FOR PETTY (bleep).

15:27.633 --> 15:30.367
-OH, OKAY. HANG TIGHT
FOR JUST A SECOND, RANDALL.

15:30.467 --> 15:36.833
CLEARLY, THE INFORMATION
THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL GAVE US IS
NOT WHO WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE.

15:36.933 --> 15:39.233
THIS IS PROBABLY
HIS FATHER.

15:39.333 --> 15:43.367
UM, BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT THE, UH...

15:43.467 --> 15:45.233
HE'S NOT WHO HE SAYS
HE IS.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.933
SO, WE'RE ABOUT
TO INVESTIGATE JUST
A LITTLE BIT FURTHER.

15:52.867 --> 15:56.067
RANDALL?

15:56.100 --> 15:58.267
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME, BUDDY.

15:58.367 --> 15:59.567
OKAY?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.400
A LONG TIME.
AND I'M VERY THOROUGH.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.533
SOME PEOPLE WOULD EVEN SAY
THAT I'M METICULOUS.

16:05.633 --> 16:09.833
TELL ME HOW THE STATE OF
GEORGIA GOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S
PICTURE ON YOUR LICENSE?

16:09.933 --> 16:12.767
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE
OPPORTUNITY. WHY ARE YOU
LYING TO ME?

16:12.867 --> 16:14.833
-I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.
-YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.533
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE PHOTO

16:16.633 --> 16:18.267
OF THE INFORMATION
THAT YOU JUST GAVE ME?

16:18.367 --> 16:19.733
'CAUSE I CAN SHOW IT
TO YOU,

16:19.833 --> 16:21.733
AND IT SURELY IS NOT YOU.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.567
-MY NAME'S RANDALL...

16:23.667 --> 16:25.633
-MM-HMM. WHO ARE YOU?

16:25.733 --> 16:28.433
-THAT'S MY NAME.
-AND WHAT'S YOUR
DATE OF BIRTH?

16:28.533 --> 16:29.733
-...'55.
-OKAY.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.133
LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PHOTO.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.567
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THE PHOTO?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.167
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR SUITCASE
RIGHT THERE.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.200
WHO IS THAT?
-I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.767
-YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
WHERE'S YOUR WALLET?

16:39.867 --> 16:41.300
-HERE.

16:46.333 --> 16:50.467
-I BELIEVE IF I GIVE YOU
RESPECT, YOU SHOULD RECIPROCATE
THAT, ALL RIGHT?

16:50.567 --> 16:52.567
I GIVE YOU RESPECT,
GIVE ME RESPECT, OKAY?

16:52.667 --> 16:54.233
YOU'RE NOT BEING TRUTHFUL.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.633
WHY YOU'RE NOT BEING
TRUTHFUL, I DON'T KNOW.

17:00.933 --> 17:02.800
WHO IS AILEEN?

17:02.900 --> 17:04.100
-THAT'S MY LADY.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.200
-OH! AN E.F. CARD.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.467
OH!

17:10.767 --> 17:11.900
FUNNY.

17:12.067 --> 17:14.300
IT DOESN'T SAY RANDALL
AT ALL.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.800
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

17:15.900 --> 17:18.067
GO-- HUMOR ME.
READ WHAT NAME THAT SAYS.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.167
WHAT NAME DOES THAT SAY?

17:22.300 --> 17:25.133

-YES, SIR.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.800
-SO, WHEN YOU GET SHOOK UP,
YOU JUST AUTOMATICALLY START
BLURTING LIES?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.167
ALL RIGHT, GO STAND RIGHT
UP THERE AT THE FRONT
OF THE CAR.

17:42.267 --> 17:45.067
NOW, WE'RE GONNA CHECK
HIS TRUE IDENTITY.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.667
AND FIGURE OUT
WHY HE'S LYING TO ME.

18:06.767 --> 18:10.067
OKAY, YOU'RE STILL ON
FELONY PROBATION.

18:10.167 --> 18:12.167
ALL RIGHT, I NEED YOU
TO PLACE YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

18:19.233 --> 18:23.233
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON YOUR PERSON THAT'S GONNA
STICK, POKE, PROD, OR CUT ME?

18:23.333 --> 18:25.633
NO? DO YOU HAVE
A SUBSTANCE PROBLEM?

18:25.733 --> 18:27.333
I FEEL A PUSH STEM
RIGHT THERE.

18:27.433 --> 18:28.867
WHAT AM I FEELING

18:28.967 --> 18:31.533
AND STEMS, ANY NEEDLES,
ANY RAZORS?

18:31.633 --> 18:32.667

TO STUFF A PIPE.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.667
YOU DON'T SMOKE?

18:41.767 --> 18:43.267
YOU DON'T DO ANY
KIND OF DRUGS?

18:43.367 --> 18:45.933
-YEAH, I DO, UH, PILLS.
-YOU DO PILLS.

18:46.067 --> 18:48.167
WHAT KIND OF PILLS

18:48.267 --> 18:50.067
-PERCOCET.

18:50.100 --> 18:53.833

19:01.700 --> 19:04.633
IF YOU'D JUST TOLD ME

19:21.067 --> 19:23.267
-OKAY. SO, I CAUGHT YOU

GONNA COMPOUND EVERYTHING. OKAY?

19:48.667 --> 19:49.700
