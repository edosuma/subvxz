WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.755
Previously on 90210:
Javier had this notebook
of songs.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.632
After he died, I took it.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.090
I'm famous.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.427
You won't be,
if I tell 'em the truth.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.679
You could expose me,

00:11.720 --> 00:15.182
or you can continue being
my manager, on my terms.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.433
It's not the way that
Adrianna's been acting

00:16.475 --> 00:17.768
that's been
bothering me.

00:17.810 --> 00:20.395
It's also the way that
I've been feeling about you.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.858
Ivy doesn't know that
you and I slept together.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.776
Babe, I know you're upset.
Yes! I'm upset!

00:25.818 --> 00:28.487
Upset, because my
mother is a whore!

00:32.366 --> 00:34.535
Well, I don't feel that
way about you either.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.870
I'm still in love with Dax.

00:35.911 --> 00:38.455
Dax is here!
I can't handle this!

00:38.497 --> 00:39.623
LIAM:
No he's going to
think you have

00:39.665 --> 00:41.917
a new boyfriend.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.919
Stay away from my girl.
I know she's much
better off without you.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.171
(grunting)

00:54.638 --> 00:58.600
♪ ♪

00:58.642 --> 00:59.852
Wait until you see this house.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.396
It is so Sunset Boulevard.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.564
I thought we were off
of Mulholland.

01:03.605 --> 01:04.690
Yeah, get this.

01:04.732 --> 01:05.900
Allegedly, supposedly--

01:05.941 --> 01:08.109
you didn't hear it from me-- but

01:08.151 --> 01:10.111
Gloria Swanson actually
used to live here.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.531
Oh-ho! Sunset Boulevard
the movie-- Sunset Boulevard.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.615
That's right, Gloria Swanson.

01:13.657 --> 01:14.950
I mean, come on! She was huge!

01:14.992 --> 01:16.618
"It was the pictures
that got small."

01:16.660 --> 01:17.995
Exactly.

01:18.037 --> 01:19.621
Now, it's not cheap,

01:19.663 --> 01:21.874
but the legend, the history;

01:21.916 --> 01:23.208
it's beyond fabulous.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.793
And when I saw this place,
I said to myself,

01:24.835 --> 01:26.879
I said, "This place is so

01:26.921 --> 01:28.881
Adrianna."
(gasps)

01:28.923 --> 01:31.050
ADRIANNA:
It is so me.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.051
I love it!

01:32.091 --> 01:33.844
I want it.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.055
Uh, what do you say
we, uh...

01:36.095 --> 01:38.891
we look inside before
we start making offers.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.559
There's no "we," Victor.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.812
There is me, and there is you,
who works for me.

01:43.854 --> 01:48.650
(sighs) "I'm ready for
my close-up, Mr. DeMille."

01:48.692 --> 01:50.778
REALTOR:
Incredible, right?

01:50.819 --> 01:54.031
The parties that have been
thrown in this house: legendary.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.574
Really?
Mm-hmm.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.867
Well, apparently,
supposedly--

01:56.909 --> 01:57.785
you didn't hear
this from me--

01:57.826 --> 01:59.202
but Rudolph Valentino

01:59.244 --> 02:01.705
once swung across this room
on a chandelier.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.916
In the nude.
Whoa.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.042
Mm-hmm. Come on.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.923
I want to throw a party here.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.424
A huge party.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.927
(giggles)

02:14.969 --> 02:17.096
(sighs)
Wow.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.474
This is a house
for a star, Adrianna.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.142
Honestly--

02:22.183 --> 02:24.853
and I say this as your friend,
not as your real estate agent--

02:24.895 --> 02:26.897
this house is your destiny.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.108
Okay! How much is it?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.109
20 grand a month, and you're

02:30.150 --> 02:31.693
going to have to commit
for six months.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.028
When destiny calls...

02:33.070 --> 02:34.738
Adrianna?
What?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.533
I'll give you
two a moment.
No, I...

02:38.575 --> 02:39.743
(whispers)
It's okay.
Fine.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.704
What?
Look,

02:42.746 --> 02:44.581
I wouldn't be doing my job...

02:44.623 --> 02:48.209
as your manager, if I
didn't at least suggest...

02:48.251 --> 02:50.129
that you look for a house
that's more affordable.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.839
(scoffs)
You're such a wet blanket.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.632
I don't mean to be
a wet blanket, but...

02:53.674 --> 02:55.634
six months' commitment,

02:55.676 --> 02:56.969
that's no joke.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.595
A lot of things can change

02:58.637 --> 03:00.139
in the music business
in six months.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.474
I see. So, you don't
believe in me?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.475
It's not that, I swear.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.810
You know what?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.145
It doesn't matter
if you do or you don't...

03:06.185 --> 03:07.896
because I believe in me,

03:07.938 --> 03:09.148
and my career is
going to be just fine.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.108
It's not that I doubt you,

03:11.150 --> 03:13.568
but being cautious
financially...

03:13.610 --> 03:15.529
Fine. You want me
to save my money?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.531
I'm cutting your
commission in half.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.658
Happy now?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.994
I'll take it!

03:22.036 --> 03:23.912
Congratulations!

03:26.165 --> 03:27.666
You love it here,
don't ya, Beyoncé?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.584
(yips)

03:30.836 --> 03:32.087
So cute!

03:36.133 --> 03:38.010
Oh! Wipe out.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.637
Hey!

03:40.679 --> 03:41.889
Hi.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.016
About what happened
at the luau...

03:44.058 --> 03:45.142
Yep.
And, uh,

03:45.184 --> 03:47.061
me confessing my
feelings for you...

03:47.102 --> 03:48.062
Awkward or not awkward?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.730
I'm taking a poll.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.774
Uh... I might go...
with awkward.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.026
Yeah. Aw.
Yeah.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.819
Yeah.
I'm just

03:55.861 --> 03:57.529
really confused, Silver.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.657
I mean, officially,
I'm with Adrianna.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.325
But maybe I shouldn't be.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.079
I just...

04:05.120 --> 04:06.705
I don't feel
the same way I felt.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.498
And there's you.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.460
Truth is... uh,
what I said at the beach...

04:12.502 --> 04:14.963
I think we've been spending
too much time together.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.798
What?
You have a girlfriend.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.634
Your girlfriend's
my good friend.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.763
Let's just give each other
some space, okay?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.141
NAOMI:
Seriously, I can't believe

04:26.183 --> 04:27.642
those eyelashes
of yours are real.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.644
Yeah, I can't believe that
fake eyelashes exist.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
Dude, don't you think the
idea that women use, like,

04:31.897 --> 04:34.983
glue to attach false pieces
of hair made from plastic,

04:35.025 --> 04:37.569
to their lids,
at all strange?
Um, no.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.988
Well, we will agree
to disagree, then.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.032
Mm-hmm. Speaking
of body hair,

04:42.074 --> 04:43.408
I'm going to
this amazing new

04:43.450 --> 04:44.993
wax place tonight, if
you want to come with.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.830
They serve blueberry margaritas,
and they so don't card.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.665
Yeah, no thank you.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.334
Not that the idea of
blueberry-flavored

04:53.376 --> 04:54.753
cocktails and hair removal
doesn't sound

04:54.795 --> 04:56.088
like a killer
combination...

04:56.130 --> 04:58.090
but... I have plans.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.091
Hmm.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.926
I'm seeing my dad tonight.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.761
Going to see your dad?

05:02.803 --> 05:03.929
I didn't... know
he was in the picture.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.264
Yeah, well, we haven't

05:05.305 --> 05:08.016
spoken in, like... years,

05:08.058 --> 05:10.811
but, uh... things are pretty bad
with my mom back at home,

05:10.852 --> 05:12.980
so I just figured...
You'd call your dad.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.190
Yeah. And I didn't know how
it was going to go, right?

05:15.232 --> 05:17.025
'Cause I thought he'd moved on,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.610
and he has this new family...

05:18.652 --> 05:21.780
maybe he didn't...
care about me anymore.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.074
But... he was totally
into it.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.533
It was really cool.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.911
And he, like, wanted to do
something right away, so...

05:27.953 --> 05:29.871
Anyways, we'll see.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.706
Oh! It's going to go great.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.250
And if it doesn't,
and you need to bail,

05:33.292 --> 05:35.752
just join me for
a Blueberry Brazilian.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.172
Uh, yeah, no.
That sounds horrible.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.881
It's amazing.
Dude, that
sounds horrible.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.967
Okay, we'll agree
to disagree.
Fine.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.802
TEACHER:
Pleistocene Era...

05:43.844 --> 05:45.720
(teacher continues
indistinctly)

05:45.762 --> 05:47.639
(sighs)

05:51.768 --> 05:53.145
Hey.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.896
Hey. What are you up to?

05:54.938 --> 05:56.564
Escaping the Pleistocene Era.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.066
Oh, please. You don't look
a day over Holocene.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.901
(laughs)
Um...

05:59.943 --> 06:01.903
So that was fun.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.530
The luau.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.242
Yeah. It was.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.119
Yeah.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.038
(door closing)

06:11.079 --> 06:14.041
What's wrong?
Uh, uh,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.001
I'm just... I'm not...

06:16.043 --> 06:19.171
I'm not ready
for everyone to know I'm...

06:19.213 --> 06:20.755
Gay?

06:23.133 --> 06:25.177
Look, I like you,
and I want to keep seeing you,

06:25.219 --> 06:26.761
but... I-I need it to be a...

06:26.803 --> 06:29.014
A secret.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.932
Yeah. I guess.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.769
Look...

06:34.811 --> 06:37.981
I came out of the
closet in ninth grade,

06:38.023 --> 06:39.900
and I'm not willing
to go back there again.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.154
I'm sorry, Teddy.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.621
(sighs)

06:53.663 --> 06:55.332
GIRL: Oh, my God.
That's ridiculous.
GIRL 2:
Exactly.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.125
He said that I said that?
Exactly.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.752
That's absurd.
Screw him.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.295
Who doesn't get yeast infections
these days?
Seriously,

07:00.337 --> 07:02.297
Oh, anywhere.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.507
I should shove a trombone
The gas station; the grocery
store; the drug store,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.009
up his you-know-what.
for that matter. I know.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.762
As if I would ever, ever...
I know, exactly.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.847
Well, he's not un-cute...
Exactly.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.432
(wry laugh)
People are rude.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.351
No kidding.
(cell phone rings)

07:16.477 --> 07:18.355
It's Charlie.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.814
Go ahead.
Thanks.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.733
No, no, no, no.
Mark didn't say that.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.984
Hey.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.195
Oh, I miss you, too.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.114
That's really it. I just...

07:27.155 --> 07:28.407
called to say I miss you.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.243
Oh! Well, I miss you.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.494
You want to do something soon,
or... ?
Definitely.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.497
Tonight, I'm sleeping over
at Adrianna's new house.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.751
But tomorrow night you better
come to that party with me.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.003
Adrianna's getting
an ice-skating rink.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.964
Apparently, she's going all-out
so I can only imagine
Annie!

07:44.005 --> 07:45.340
what that will mean.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.092
Dixon, I'm on the phone.
Sorry.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.051
Liam is in the hospital.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.095
Wait. What do you mean?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.846
Is he okay? What happened?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.014
Is everything all right?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.182
Liam's in the hospital.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.976
What happened?
Uh, I don't know.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.019
Apparently, he got beat up
real bad after the luau.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.981
They took him to the hospital
last night.
We gotta go.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.941
I gotta go.
Well, no, i-is Liam all right?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.026
I don't know. I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.340
Hey, Naomi.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.384
So I enjoyed eating

08:29.426 --> 08:31.261
guacamole with you
the other night.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.846
That sounds dirty.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.640
I didn't mean it dirty.
I meant it for real.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.518
It was kind of fun being
miserable with you, too.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.438
Oh, it looks like
you've healed.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.563
Ugh!
Time heals all wounds.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.443
Time, and a boatload
of Crème de la Mar.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.445
Well, you look great.
Thank you.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.323
Hey, um, so...

08:51.365 --> 08:53.074
would you like to
go out with me sometime?

08:53.116 --> 08:55.369
I don't know. Maybe.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.078
Well, it's not a no.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.413
But it's not a yes.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.333
Not yet.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.588
Uh...

09:09.924 --> 09:12.469
Look, I know you
hate Oscar.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.554
Okay? But he's really not such

09:14.595 --> 09:16.473
a bad guy.
Look, Naomi, he is, okay?

09:16.515 --> 09:18.225
He's a really, really bad guy.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.893
But he's...
But he's what? He's...

09:19.934 --> 09:20.977
he's hot?

09:21.019 --> 09:22.312
Yeah, but...

09:22.354 --> 09:23.897
Look-look, I'm sorry.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.106
You haven't forgotten
what he did to me, have you?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.858
No! Of course not.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.902
But... but just because
someone does a bad thing,

09:28.943 --> 09:30.945
doesn't mean
they're a bad person.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.197
Maybe he's learned his lesson,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.491
you know?
Okay. You know what?

09:34.533 --> 09:37.160
Naomi, just do your thing.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.371
Okay? Seriously, it-it's cool.
It's totally cool.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.540
You just...
you live your life.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.375
I'm going to live mine.
It's all good.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.584
No harm: no foul. Okay?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.586
But...
What?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.506
So, they don't remake The Odd
Couple starring you and me.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.049
It's... it's okay.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.050
I think I'll live.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.346
ANNIE:
Liam, you need to take it easy.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.139
You guys, I'm fine. You don't
have to worry about me.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.850
Liam, you're
not fine. Okay?

10:00.892 --> 10:03.103
You're staying in my room,
and I'm sleeping on the couch.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.938
You don't have to give up your
room, 'cause I'm not...

10:04.979 --> 10:06.440
Liam! Look.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.691
You got your ass kicked.
Okay?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.735
Now if you don't shut up
and let us take care of you,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.362
you're going to
get it kicked again.
Yeah.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.613
By me.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.073
(whispering):
Yikes.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.950
What do you want us to do?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.368
Let you go back
to sleeping in your car?

10:18.410 --> 10:20.495
Uh...

10:21.496 --> 10:23.915
All right.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.417
That's right.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.587
You don't want to deal
with these fists of fury.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.255
Oh... (laughs)
You're staying.
Come on.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.517
Hello, they've got prime rib.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.270
Oh, do they?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.521
Do you eat red meat?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.190
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.984
Of course I eat
red meat, um...

10:51.025 --> 10:52.735
But we don't have
a lot at home,

10:52.777 --> 10:54.654
'cause Mom's a vegetarian
mostly, you know, but...

10:54.695 --> 10:56.531
I love... red meat.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.493
I don't think I've ever
had prime rib, though.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.996
Why do they even call prime rib,
"prime rib" anyway?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.290
You know, is it, is it like,
there are some ribs

11:05.332 --> 11:07.334
that are prime, and others
that are less than prime,

11:07.375 --> 11:08.668
'cause who's going to order

11:08.709 --> 11:10.003
less than prime rib,
you know, that would...

11:10.044 --> 11:12.671
Okay, I'm officially
shutting up now.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.342
No, I'm... I'm glad
to hear you talk.

11:15.383 --> 11:19.012
I'm sorry. I'm obviously
a little nervous to see you.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.473
And excited.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.517
But I feel like nervous
and excited equals

11:23.558 --> 11:25.143
me rambling on like
an auctioneer.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.187
And I'm sorry.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.606
I'm really glad you called me.

11:29.648 --> 11:32.859
I've actually been trying
to get in touch with you.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.488
It's just... your mother
told me to keep my distance.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.156
She did?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.408
She-She actually told you
to stay away from me?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.327
Mm-hmm.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.662
God, she is... unbelievable.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.121
Classic Laurel.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.540
Yeah. Totally.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.707
Your mother doesn't
always think about

11:48.749 --> 11:51.127
how her decisions will
affect other people.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.672
No kidding.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.507
We're not really
speaking at the moment.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.467
Welcome to the club.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.513
But, look,

12:01.555 --> 12:04.599
the important thing is we're
getting a chance to start over.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.851
You and me.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.021
Yeah. I'm really, really,
really glad for that.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.232
Do you sing?

12:12.273 --> 12:14.067
No. I mean, you know

12:14.108 --> 12:15.569
not, like, outside of
the shower or anything.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.820
Well, you should
start practicing.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.240
Because... we do a lot of
caroling at our house

12:20.281 --> 12:22.075
around the holidays.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.869
Spend Christmas with me.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.581
Really?

12:27.622 --> 12:30.041
'Cause Mom never does
the Christmas thing,

12:30.083 --> 12:33.878
and we do some, like,
Winter Solstice thing, but...

12:33.920 --> 12:36.715
I've kind of missed,
like, a real Christmas.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.175
Then it's a deal.
It's a good time.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.219
We have a big Christmas tree,

12:41.261 --> 12:43.304
and a turkey dinner...
And caroling.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.306
And caroling!
It's fun, actually.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.434
I don't sing, but...

12:47.475 --> 12:49.227
I am learning how
to play the guitar.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.562
Well, bring your guitar!

12:50.604 --> 12:53.648
Hello, folks. What can
I get you for dinner tonight?

12:56.901 --> 13:01.573
You know, I'm actually
going to try the prime rib.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.916
Hello?

13:15.587 --> 13:17.464
Ade?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.340
Hi!
Whoa, what...? Hi!

13:19.382 --> 13:20.883
(Adrianna giggling)

13:20.925 --> 13:23.553
So? What do you think
of my humble abode?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.639
Uh... I think
it's insane!

13:25.680 --> 13:28.391
What did you...
This is totally...

13:28.433 --> 13:31.102
and wonderfully
and clinically insane!

13:31.144 --> 13:33.730
You have a balcony
in your foyer.
Right?

13:33.772 --> 13:36.274
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art
thou Romeo?"

13:36.316 --> 13:41.237
Oh, Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down
your gorgeous hair extensions!

13:42.697 --> 13:44.574
Navid.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.117
Hey.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.119
Are you... are you
sleeping over?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.455
Yeah. I decided to make
it a guy-girl thing,

13:50.497 --> 13:51.748
but no one else could make it.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.832
I guess Annie and Dixon
are with Liam,

13:53.874 --> 13:56.252
and apparently Naomi is drunk

13:56.294 --> 13:57.878
after some kind of
waxing session--

13:57.920 --> 14:00.131
God knows what that means--
and Ivy's with her dad.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.758
So it's just the three of us.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.426
Oh. Okay.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.261
And Beyoncé.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.513
(forced laugh)

14:06.554 --> 14:07.722
This is going to be so much fun!

14:07.764 --> 14:10.224
So much fun.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.060
Yeah, totally.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.650
Isn't this relaxing?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.777
Yeah, this is great.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.321
Absolutely.
Very relaxing.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.615
Yeah.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.201
Uh, you know what?

14:28.242 --> 14:29.577
Maybe I should, uh,
get out pretty soon.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.662
I feel like an
overcooked noodle.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.497
Oh, don't be silly.
You just got in.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.542
Just relax.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.712
(cell phone chimes)

14:38.753 --> 14:40.714
SILVER: So Ade, how're things
going with you album?

14:40.755 --> 14:42.632
Ugh. Hold that thought.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.842
Victor is here.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.594
Apparently, he has
something to drop off.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.555
Some sort of holiday present.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.182
You two, soak.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
No, no, I'll come
with you.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.062
Uh, no, seriously, I'm
getting a little woozy, uh...

14:58.481 --> 15:00.066
Sorry to bother you.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.735
Yeah, well, I was hanging
with my friends, but...

15:01.776 --> 15:03.194
whatever, you're here now.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.572
Nice robes.
They're hers.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.367
Uh, anyway, this is for you.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.872
It's just a little Christmas
gift slash housewarming present.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.749
Housewarming?
If it was up to you,

15:15.790 --> 15:17.417
I wouldn't even
live in this place.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.502
Slash... apology gift.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.338
(sarcastic laugh)

15:28.302 --> 15:30.263
A blanket?

15:30.304 --> 15:31.848
And a bottle of champagne.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.308
Non-alcoholic, of course.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.519
Yeah, get it?

15:36.561 --> 15:38.062
A "wet blanket"?

15:38.104 --> 15:40.732
'Cause I was being such a,
you know, downer before?

15:40.774 --> 15:44.778
It's... it's cashmere.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.696
Look, I could pretend
like I love it,

15:46.738 --> 15:49.532
but to be honest,
I really don't love it.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.409
It'd be easier for me
if you just returned it.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.535
Do you mind?

15:52.577 --> 15:53.703
Thanks.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.747
Yeah... okay, sure.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.956
That's... my bad.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.923
What?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.633
Uh, that was pretty harsh.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.677
Oh, please, you
feel bad for Victor?

16:09.719 --> 16:11.679
That guy treated me like crap,
and you know it.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.556
You hated him, Navid!

16:13.598 --> 16:15.475
A blanket? Seriously?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.488
LAUREL:
Hey, babe?

16:29.614 --> 16:31.908
It's late.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.285
You should get some sleep.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.620
(sighs)

16:35.662 --> 16:37.538
So...

16:37.580 --> 16:38.915
I've got a surprise.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.334
We're going to Rome.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.961
I figured we needed
a vacation this year.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.339
You can see your cousins,
check out the Sistine Chapel.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.341
I just... booked us a flight.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.009
You did.
Leaving tomorrow.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.761
Hey, don't worry.
I already picked up a piñata

16:51.803 --> 16:54.013
on Olvera Street.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.849
The traditional Mother-Daughter
Winter Solstice Holiday Madness

16:55.890 --> 16:58.309
tradition will remain intact.
I called Dad.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.145
What?

17:01.187 --> 17:04.315
Yeah. Okay? I called Dad,
and we went to dinner,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.317
and he invited me
to spend Christmas with him.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.902
Like a real Christmas,

17:07.944 --> 17:10.655
not a Winter Solstice
with a piñata.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.407
A Christmas with a tree,
and a turkey, and carols...

17:14.450 --> 17:16.076
I can't believe you
called your father.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.744
No, more like you can't
believe that your efforts

17:17.787 --> 17:18.954
to keep us apart
didn't actually work.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.708
That's not true.
Okay, so...

17:21.749 --> 17:23.334
you didn't tell Dad
to stay away from me?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.419
I...

17:25.461 --> 17:27.380
Yes, I did.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.384
You know, but with good reason.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.428
Your-your father, Ivy,
he's not a good guy.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.930
He's selfish,
and not trustworthy.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.891
Not trustworthy?

17:37.932 --> 17:40.894
Wow, that's really funny.
You, talking about trust.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.399
I'm not going to Italy, okay?
You can go without me.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.195
You know what, it's really late.
I'd like to get some rest.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.287
(whining, yipping)

18:01.706 --> 18:03.332
(barks)

18:03.374 --> 18:05.251
(sighs)

18:19.515 --> 18:22.685
Come on, Beyoncé.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.191
Uh. Hi.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.070
Couldn't sleep.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.030
Right.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.949
Just... got a glass of water.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.455
Look, um...

18:42.496 --> 18:44.457
I can't stop thinking
about you, Silver.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.796
And now I got to ask you,
is what I'm feeling

18:49.837 --> 18:51.798
all in my head?

18:53.091 --> 18:54.968
Yes.

19:04.518 --> 19:09.482
You mean... you don't feel
the same way that I feel?

19:11.776 --> 19:14.487
What are you guys doing?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.864
Getting a glass of water.
Just walking Beyoncé.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.366
Well, I just had the most
horrible nightmare ever.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.621
I was at the Grammys,
and I was wearing the same dress

19:23.663 --> 19:26.082
as Miley Cyrus.
I'm literally shaking.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.291
(laughs)

19:39.804 --> 19:40.972
♪ ♪

19:41.014 --> 19:44.558
(people chatter, laugh)

19:44.600 --> 19:46.352
NAOMI:
Whoa!

19:48.646 --> 19:50.523
Hey, girls. Say cheese!

19:50.564 --> 19:53.151
Cheese!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.694
(laughing)

19:56.195 --> 19:57.822
Outdoor ice-skating in L.A.?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.157
Come on, big whoop.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.408
I get it.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.911
Someone's jealous they didn't
think of it for their big party.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.997
I had ice sculptures and
cookies with my face on it.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.331
She does not have cookies.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.333
True. On the other hand,
she has Justin Bieber.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.252
Get out. What?
No, I saw him by
the latke table.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.754
He was double-dipping
in the applesauce.

20:13.796 --> 20:18.551
Also spotted: Jeremy Piven and
Rachel Zoe, I mean, oh, my God.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.136

You should go to Ade's party.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.011
I'm not going to Ade's party.

What the hell
are you doing here?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.691
I was worried
about you.
Get out.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.818
I just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.153
You know what, I will be okay

22:00.194 --> 22:01.988
if you get out of my face!
Get out!

22:02.029 --> 22:04.115
If you'd just
let me talk...
I don't want to talk!

22:04.157 --> 22:06.117
Okay, man.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.129
I'm sorry.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.172
I was worried.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.715
I know, but everything's okay.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.759
Dixon and I will
take care of Liam.

Okay, I just...

22:25.385 --> 22:26.720
Just take good care of him.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.973
Yeah, I will.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.100
I'll see you later.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.476
Absolutely.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.321
Okay, oh, my God,
thank you all

22:43.361 --> 22:45.363
so much for coming.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.700
This is amazing.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.793
The holidays are a time
when we can celebrate miracles.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.962
Christians celebrate
the miraculous virgin birth

23:00.004 --> 23:01.881
of Jesus Christ-- from whom
we get the word "Christmas."

23:02.882 --> 23:04.300
And Jews celebrate

23:04.342 --> 23:06.802
some sort of
miraculous candle oil

23:06.844 --> 23:08.721
that burned way longer
than advertised.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.805
(laughter)

23:09.847 --> 23:11.389
And when I look out
at all of you

23:11.431 --> 23:14.227
and I think about
my life right now--

23:14.268 --> 23:18.147
my success, my friends,

23:18.189 --> 23:19.857
my forthcoming album... (laughs)

23:19.899 --> 23:21.399
(laughter)

23:21.441 --> 23:22.400
I keep thinking

23:22.442 --> 23:24.904
that I'm living a miracle.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.155
(crowd aahs)

I love you all, guys.

has changed just this year.

23:39.459 --> 23:41.879
Everything's different.

23:41.921 --> 23:45.841
Ade's a huge pop star

you've gone through
a pretty big change yourself.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.269
What do you mean?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.854
You know, not being able

Oh. (clears throat)

24:00.398 --> 24:02.275

Not being able

You didn't tell me
you could surf like that.

24:08.822 --> 24:09.865
You're seriously good.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.117
Okay, no, I seriously

24:11.158 --> 24:12.285
wiped out, like, four times.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.120
Ivy, I am so
impressed with you.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.871
So, tell me,

24:15.913 --> 24:17.123
is surfing something
you want to do with your life?

24:17.164 --> 24:18.291
Yeah.

24:18.332 --> 24:19.875
God, I would

24:19.917 --> 24:22.878
love, love-love-love-love
to be a pro surfer.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.380
That'd be amazing.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.215
So is that something
that you'd do

24:26.257 --> 24:27.300
right away out
of high school?

24:27.341 --> 24:29.551
Yeah, maybe.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.637
I'd be stoked, but on
the other hand, you know,

24:31.678 --> 24:34.140
I don't want to miss out
on the chance to go to college.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.392
And coming from

24:36.434 --> 24:37.768
the parental angle,
you probably think

24:37.810 --> 24:39.145
I should go
to college first, huh?

24:39.186 --> 24:40.478
Well, whatever you want.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.106
You know, I just...

24:42.148 --> 24:43.732
Just what?

24:43.774 --> 24:45.525
(sighs)

24:45.567 --> 24:48.154
Never mind. I don't want to rag
on your mother too much.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.738
No, no, no, no, tell me.
What were you gonna say?

24:49.780 --> 24:52.825
Okay.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.285
I'll tell you this
because I feel like

24:54.327 --> 24:56.036
we get each other, you and me.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.997
Yeah, totally. What's up?

24:58.038 --> 25:00.207
I'm not sure how much you know
about how the divorce went down.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.335
Not much. Mom was always
pretty tight-lipped about it.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.337
That's typical.

25:04.378 --> 25:07.006
Uh, well, things were
threatening to get nasty,

25:07.047 --> 25:10.384
and I agreed to some things
that maybe I shouldn't have.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.927
Like what?
What did she make you do?

25:11.969 --> 25:14.263
There's a clause
in the divorce papers

25:14.305 --> 25:16.015
that says I have to pay
for your college.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.100
And I have two kids of my own
right behind you,

25:18.142 --> 25:19.310
and I don't have
the kind of money

25:19.352 --> 25:21.395
your mother does.

25:21.437 --> 25:22.938
And now that we're
on good terms,

25:22.980 --> 25:25.232
hopefully we could
present a united front

25:25.274 --> 25:26.608
to Laurel
to tell her

25:26.650 --> 25:28.402
that paying for your college
is her responsibility.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.491
Oh, hey, did I mention that you
should stop by for Christmas?

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
You really should
try and make it.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.661
Patricia and the kids and I
have a real blast,

25:37.703 --> 25:39.537
and it'd be so cool
if you could come by.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.915
Yeah.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.583
Yeah, no, that sounds good.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.344
(squeals)

25:53.386 --> 25:56.263
How gorgeous is this?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.931
I love it.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.059
(quietly):
God, this is hideous.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.143
Return pile.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.145
(giggles)

26:03.187 --> 26:04.980
Another present for me?

26:05.022 --> 26:06.606
Yay!

26:06.648 --> 26:08.734
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna take a walk, Ade.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.154
A scarf?

26:12.196 --> 26:13.197
Oh, my gosh.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.450
This is so
beautiful.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.452
(sighs) Oh, I'll see you
in a little bit, babe.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.162
Do we hate it?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.372
Oh, we so hate it.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.541
Return pile.

26:23.581 --> 26:26.043
Candy cane, gingerbread,
figgy pudding?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.878
No, thanks.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.883
Candy cane, gingerbread,
figgy pudding?

26:32.925 --> 26:35.261
I didn't even know figgy
pudding was a real thing.

26:35.302 --> 26:36.929
Oh, it's real, all right.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.097
Real delicious.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.597
Yeah. No, thanks.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.309
I'm actually just
about to take off.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.186
Turns out, watching
other people have fun

26:44.228 --> 26:46.105
doesn't always
cheer a person up.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.190
Thank you, though.

26:48.232 --> 26:49.607
Candy cane, gingerbread,
figgy pudding?

26:49.649 --> 26:50.608
Hey.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.610
Hey.

26:52.652 --> 26:55.239
How was dinner?

26:55.281 --> 26:57.615
(sighs)

26:57.657 --> 26:59.535
Look, I know you're
still annoyed with me

26:59.577 --> 27:01.579
about the whole Oscar thing.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.581
But I just...

27:03.621 --> 27:05.249
What was it like
to see your dad?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.250
How did it go?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.001
How did it go?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.211
Well, I'll tell you.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.628
It went horribly, okay?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.631
Turns out,
he doesn't actually

27:13.673 --> 27:17.052
care about me at all
and it sucked.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.345
Happy holidays.

27:23.225 --> 27:27.438
"To Adrianna,
may this holiday season

"bring you
everything you deserve.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.400
With love, Victor."

27:31.442 --> 27:32.985
Ugh, what a kiss-ass.

27:33.026 --> 27:33.986
Where is he, anyway?

27:34.027 --> 27:35.488
Who cares?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.615
This better be good
or someone's unemployed.

27:37.655 --> 27:38.949
(laughs)
RENEE:
Open it.

27:38.991 --> 27:39.741
Open it.

27:44.538 --> 27:46.081
What is it?
What did you get?

27:46.123 --> 27:48.208
ILON:
What is it, a photo?

27:48.250 --> 27:49.293
GINNY:
Who took it?

27:49.335 --> 27:50.377
I hope someone
famous.

27:50.419 --> 27:53.046
I think he took it himself.

27:55.382 --> 27:59.052
Well, what is it, some
kind of private joke?

28:01.221 --> 28:02.515
ILON:
I do not get

28:02.556 --> 28:03.432
that man's
sense of humor.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.730
(door closes)

28:17.695 --> 28:20.032
What, did you, like,
miss your flight?

28:20.073 --> 28:22.951
I decided not to go.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.161
Why not?

28:24.203 --> 28:26.246
Naomi called me,

28:26.288 --> 28:29.375
and she told me that things
didn't go so well with your dad.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.502
And she thought you might not
want to be alone.

28:31.544 --> 28:32.503
I'm fine, okay?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.711
I'm fine.

28:33.753 --> 28:37.257
Everything's...
everything's fine.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.343
Ivy, what happened?

28:39.385 --> 28:40.469
What is it?

28:40.511 --> 28:42.054
(sniffles)

28:42.095 --> 28:44.097
He didn't really want
to have me for Christmas.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.227
Okay? He just wanted to see me

28:48.268 --> 28:50.604
because he didn't want
to pay for my college.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.690
That's it,
he just didn't want

28:52.772 --> 28:54.400
to pay for me.

28:54.441 --> 28:57.194
He has his own kids, you know,
his real kids he has to pay for.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.072
Babe... oh, sweetie, come here.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.198
(sniffles)

29:01.240 --> 29:02.533
Come on, honey.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.660
You were right, Mom.

29:04.702 --> 29:06.245
He's not trustworthy.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.413
He's not.

29:07.454 --> 29:08.706
(sobbing)

29:08.747 --> 29:11.542
Oh, God...

29:11.584 --> 29:15.045
I'm so sorry
you got hurt.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.715
And, Ivy, from the
bottom of my heart,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.133
I'm-I'm so sorry

about Oscar.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.306
And-And I'm sorry
that we don't have

29:26.348 --> 29:27.683
a white picket
fence, you know,

29:27.725 --> 29:29.809
and I don't know
how to make a turkey

29:29.851 --> 29:32.312
or-or do any of the mom things
that moms are supposed to do.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.772
Mom, it's okay.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.109
I don't care about a turkey,
not really.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.652

That's all.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.422
Well, that's something I can do.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.090
I can love you.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.800
I can love the hell
out of you, Ivy.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.518
(Beyoncé yapping)

30:18.108 --> 30:18.858
(sighs)

30:33.457 --> 30:34.500
Hello.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.793
Did you steal my notebook?

30:35.834 --> 30:36.752
Your notebook?

30:36.794 --> 30:38.420
(laughs) That's pretty funny.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.506
You did. You stole it.

30:40.547 --> 30:44.343
No, no, no, no, you stole it,
I'm merely seeking restitution.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.761
What does that mean?

30:45.803 --> 30:47.638
It means payback.
(chuckles)

30:47.680 --> 30:50.849
No, I mean, what did you do?

30:50.890 --> 30:53.393
What-What did you do
with the notebook?

30:53.435 --> 30:54.770
Look, you cut my commission
in half;

30:54.812 --> 30:56.772
I had to figure out
another way to make money.

30:56.814 --> 31:00.233
Turns out, there were a number
of "Internet journalists,"

31:00.275 --> 31:03.320
shall we say, that were willing
to pay quite handsomely.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.238
And I'm doing an exclusive
with People tomorrow.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.365
Should be fun.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.283
Yeah. Maybe they'll
take my picture.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.284
(line beeps off)

31:09.326 --> 31:10.869
Hey, sweetheart,

31:10.910 --> 31:12.663
how would you like
a cashmere blanket?

Hey, Marla, long time no talk.

IVY:
So, um, thanks for

31:51.451 --> 31:53.495
calling my mother.

31:53.537 --> 31:57.332
That was totally out of line
and an invasion of privacy

31:57.374 --> 31:59.334
and all that, but...

31:59.376 --> 32:00.836
it was sweet.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.296
And I'm grateful.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.339
I'm glad, Ivy.

32:04.381 --> 32:05.549
I know you think

32:05.591 --> 32:07.801
I'm self-centered and boy crazy,

32:07.843 --> 32:09.386
but I really
care about my friends,

32:09.428 --> 32:10.470
and you're one of my friends.

32:10.512 --> 32:13.724
Yeah, well, cool.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.392
Hos before bros.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.561
Exactly.
(laughs)

32:17.603 --> 32:20.397
And listen, I've been
thinking about it, um--

32:20.439 --> 32:23.358
As much as I think that Oscar
is a total jerk...

32:23.400 --> 32:24.818
I know, I know.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.404
No, wait, wait.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.906
I'm not gonna stand in the way,

32:28.947 --> 32:30.824
if you want to go out with him.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.951
You know, I can be
friends with you

32:32.992 --> 32:35.036
without liking
the guy that you date.

32:36.705 --> 32:39.708
Yeah?
Yeah.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.835
And I want to be friends
with you.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.338
So I guess we'll just agree
to disagree about him.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.383
Thanks, Ivy.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.718
Hey, good to go.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.219
Uh, okay.
Yo, I got to go.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.387
Okay.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.556
Happy holidays.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.600
Yeah. You, too, Naomi.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.276
That a girl.
You got a piece of it.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.736
I hate prime rib!

33:07.778 --> 33:09.404
It's bloody

I'm sorry to wake you.

were in the hospital,

stopped or something.

If you weren't okay,
then I wouldn't be okay.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.623
Um... I'm sorry

34:44.666 --> 34:46.668
how I acted before.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.670
With Charlie.

34:48.712 --> 34:52.049
I've got my problems
with him, but...

34:52.090 --> 34:54.927
it's not just that.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.389
It's hard for me
to see you with him.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.974
Because I...

35:01.016 --> 35:03.894
because I'm in love with you.

35:06.939 --> 35:11.401
I've loved you...
for a long time.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.469
Candy cane? Gingerbread?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.429
Uh...
Figgy pudding.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.098
(chuckles)
Yeah, no, thanks.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.016
It's cool.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.481

figgy pudding.

You okay?

35:58.949 --> 36:00.659
Not really.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.702
Everything is all messed up,

36:02.744 --> 36:06.039

my own fault.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.958
What do you mean?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.794
I basically destroyed
our friendship

there's nothing between us.
