00:56.890 --> 01:00.159
Pull over. I want to walk
the rest of the way.

01:03.029 --> 01:03.996
Come on, guys.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.497
It's only a couple blocks.

01:05.498 --> 01:09.168
And I haven't been
outside the embassy in days.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.838
Hello?

01:50.043 --> 01:52.277
We're on our way.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.898
Hey, chief.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.633
How long to the target?
A little over eight minutes.
We scrambled

02:14.635 --> 02:17.569
Two fox 15-echos as soon as
the intelligence came back.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.611
Are the jets authorized
to enter pakistani airspace?

02:19.635 --> 02:21.106
Waiting for word
from centcom.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.407
Can we send a
drone instead?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.143
Not in the time frame.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.746
What about ground teams?
There are none
operating in the area.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.348
I need to talk
to islamabad.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.749
He's on the secure uplink.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.985
Okay.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.696
Talk to me, sandy.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.265
What's the issue?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.367
No issue. Only that
I'm just hearing about this

02:48.369 --> 02:49.801
For the first time.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.403
He's number four
on the hit list, carrie;

02:51.427 --> 02:52.638
What more do you need to know?

02:52.640 --> 02:54.540
The source of your intel.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.509
Same as the last four
high-value kills.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.012
Does he have a name yet,
this source?

03:00.014 --> 03:03.048
The deal was anonymity
in exchange for information.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.784
So far, it's been
a very fruitful relationship.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.146
Well, so far, we've always had
time to get a second opinion,

03:08.148 --> 03:09.648
Double-check the intelligence.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.123
Well, consider the target.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.558
What do you mean?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.400
Well, there's a reason
you don't get many shots

03:14.424 --> 03:16.795
At a guy like haissam haqqani;
he's famously careful.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.497
Well, we trained him, didn't we?

03:18.499 --> 03:20.780
Trained him? Hell, he learned
how to jump out of airplanes

03:20.804 --> 03:22.671
With the 82nd airborne.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.576
Did centcom get back?

03:30.578 --> 03:33.045
Authorization to engage.
On your command.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.181
Where's the live feed from?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.863
We got lucky, jacked
into a nato satellite.

03:37.887 --> 03:39.351
And that's the
location right there?

03:39.353 --> 03:40.752
Yeah, the building
in the middle.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.487
It's a farmhouse of
some kind, I'm told.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.590
How confident are we
haqqani's in the farmhouse?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.391
One of those
vehicles out front...

03:46.393 --> 03:49.361
The red hi-lux... we've seen it
at his compound in miranshah.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.029
What about cde concerns?

03:51.031 --> 03:54.032
No other habitations
within 75 meters of the target.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.834
Well, obviously anybody
inside the farmhouse

03:55.836 --> 03:58.737
Would be collateral damage.
Yeah.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.342
I'd feel a lot better
if we weren't so blind

04:03.344 --> 04:05.077
On such a short clock.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.179
Sandy's source
has always been rock solid.

04:07.181 --> 04:10.282
Yes, he has.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.852
And haqqani's made a bad habit
of killing american soldiers.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.190
Where are the f-15s?
Uh, they're buzzing the border.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.892
They can be on the target
in 60 seconds.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.028
Any friendlies
in the area?
No.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.097
Ordinance restrictions?
None.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.399
Send them in.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.700
Yes, ma'am.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.602
Smash 11, this is control.
How do you hear?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.404
I have you loud and clear.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.940
I have you also, smash 11.
It's playtime.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.643
12 from 11. Currently in comms
with jtac. Dial in.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.645
Hey, where you going?

04:39.647 --> 04:41.280
I think you can
handle it from here.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.162
Just have the pilots do
a couple of recce passes

04:43.164 --> 04:44.444
Afterwards for
damage assessment.

04:44.468 --> 04:45.751
Uh, stick around,
will you?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.713
I'm supposed to be on
a skype call with my sister.

04:47.737 --> 04:49.955
Stick around.
Control standing by.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.558
The group has a little
something planned.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.729
Control, we're two mikes out.
Calm winds.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.732
Copy that.
Two mikes out.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.467
Call weapons gone
and time of flight.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.337
Wilco. Hammer down.
Three, two, one.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.605
Weapons free, ten seconds.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.241
Copy that.
Ten seconds to impact.

05:15.481 --> 05:19.184
Blast two coming left.
Pick up a heading 270.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.025
Clearing airspace.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.295
Okay.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.331
Shut it down. Well done.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.333
Thank you, everybody.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.133
Chief.
Thanks, chief.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.803
Oh.
♪ for she's
a jolly good fellow ♪

05:37.805 --> 05:41.340
♪ for she's a jolly
good fellow ♪

05:41.342 --> 05:45.644
♪ for she's
a jolly good fellow ♪

05:45.646 --> 05:49.481
♪ which nobody can deny.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.383
- Happy birthday, chief.
- Happy birthday.

05:51.385 --> 05:54.052
"the drone queen"?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.887
- Speech, speech.
- Speech.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.790
Uh... Well, I, uh...

05:58.792 --> 06:01.460
I don't know what to say.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.729
Blow out the candles.
All right.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.667
Hey!

07:38.057 --> 07:39.991
Hey, maggie.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.326
What happened to you?

07:41.328 --> 07:43.829
I know. I'm sorry.
I couldn't get away.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.630
Well, you just missed them.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.266
No, don't tell me.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.268
We waited and waited.
Finally dad gave up

07:50.270 --> 07:52.270
And took her to the park.
Shit.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.639
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.341
Well, they'll be back
in a couple hours.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.443
Oh, what am I saying?
It's after midnight there.

07:58.445 --> 07:59.945
I've just taken my ambien, so...

07:59.947 --> 08:01.746
You really need to

08:01.748 --> 08:04.108
Wean yourself off that stuff,
carrie; it's not good for you.

08:04.132 --> 08:05.650
Well, neither is not sleeping.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.952
Hey,

08:06.954 --> 08:08.753
Happy birthday.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.988
Thanks.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.491
So? What'd you do
for your birthday?

08:12.493 --> 08:15.827
Interrogated a couple prisoners,
flew another mission.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.269
It's all over the internet right
now just how bad it is there.

08:18.293 --> 08:20.465
Well, that's mostly
in the tribal areas.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.834
The capital's been
relatively peaceful lately.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.803
If you can call
eight suicide attacks

08:24.805 --> 08:26.671
In a week relatively peaceful.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.041
You should be in istanbul,
out of harm's way,

08:30.043 --> 08:32.177
And franny should be with you.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.379
Well, that was the plan.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.720
How is she, anyway?

08:41.722 --> 08:45.257
A week older than
the last time we talked.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.172
<i>You guys spent $134 billion</i>

10:41.174 --> 10:45.010
On operational contractor
support last year.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.344
That figure's high.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.912
Call it $120, then.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.280
Ballpark.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.415
Okay.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.283
Ballpark.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.586
But I do know for a fact
that expenditure will double

10:54.588 --> 10:57.088
When the u.S. And nato combat
mission ends in December.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.356
Meaning we're gonna

10:58.358 --> 10:59.824
Have to hire a lot more

10:59.826 --> 11:01.586
Private military companies
like yours to fill

11:01.610 --> 11:03.094
The security vacuum.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.263
That's why
we're here, general.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.598
We have a proposal.

11:06.600 --> 11:07.832
What is it?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.669
Saul's gonna brief you.

11:13.272 --> 11:14.773
Saul?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.041
Hmm?

11:16.043 --> 11:19.177
The force multiplier effect.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.679
Yeah.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.448
What aaron means
is that, uh...

11:25.151 --> 11:28.053
Actually, I have another thing
I was gonna mention.

11:28.055 --> 11:31.790
Just a thought
I want to throw out there.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.458
Okay.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.826
If we'd known in 2001

11:34.828 --> 11:36.695
We were staying in afghanistan
this long,

11:36.697 --> 11:40.365
We'd have made
some very different choices.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.801
Right?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.502
Instead, our planning cycles
rarely looked

11:44.504 --> 11:46.237
More than
12 months ahead.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.874
So it hasn't been a 14-year war
we've been waging,

11:49.876 --> 11:54.746
But a one-year war
waged 14 times.

11:56.415 --> 12:00.552
I think we're walking away
with the job half done.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.820
Saul, could I speak
with you?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.922
Ask the general
what he thinks.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.690
Have we given
our counterinsurgency program

12:05.692 --> 12:07.826
A chance to work?
Saul.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.572
Excuse us.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.411
Saul, what are you doing?

12:26.413 --> 12:29.514
I think I have
an obligation.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.083
What are you doing?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.519
A troop drawdown
will only inspire the enemy.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.721
Afghan security forces
are nowhere near ready

12:36.723 --> 12:38.189
To step into the breach.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.858
Save it for your op-ed.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.627
We're trying
to win a contract here.
Wasn't it trollope

12:42.629 --> 12:45.463
Who said the best capitalist is
someone who's greedy and honest?

12:45.465 --> 12:49.134
First, the drawdown's happening,
whether you like it or not.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.871
Second, it represents
a significant market opportunity

12:52.873 --> 12:54.272
For this firm.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.974
I was there
when we first went in, aaron.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.056
Kabul looked like one of those
black-and-white photos

12:58.080 --> 12:59.878
Of dresden, 1945...

12:59.880 --> 13:01.479
Blasted, wasted,

13:01.481 --> 13:02.914
Deserted.
I'm aware of

13:02.916 --> 13:04.482
How much of your life
you have invested

13:04.484 --> 13:06.618
In this fight...
Girls not allowed
in school,

13:06.620 --> 13:09.954
Roving gangs of men with whips
enforcing sharia law,

13:09.956 --> 13:12.423
A safe haven again for al-qaeda.

13:12.425 --> 13:15.460
It's not your job anymore
to have a say in the matter.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.729
We really want
to risk going back to all that?

13:17.731 --> 13:20.064
Did you hear me, saul?

13:20.066 --> 13:22.300
It's not
your job anymore.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.604
Do we have the after-action
download from the cockpits?

13:26.606 --> 13:27.939
We do.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.501
I want to see the
reconnaissance photos.

13:29.525 --> 13:31.509
Mary's got them
on her laptop.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.611
The deaths
of over 40 civilians.

13:33.613 --> 13:37.015
The strike took place at
11:04 p.M. In dande darpa khel,

13:37.017 --> 13:41.352
A militant stronghold in the
north waziristan tribal agency

13:41.354 --> 13:42.487
Near the afghan border.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.289
Members of the pakistani taliban

13:44.291 --> 13:46.991
Vowed retaliation
for the alleged attack.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.928
"haissam haqqani has been
martyred," said a spokesperson

13:49.930 --> 13:53.531
For the pakistani taliban,
who added that mr. Haqqani

13:53.533 --> 13:56.467
Was attending a wedding
at the time of the attack

13:56.469 --> 14:00.138
And that over 40 members
of his family were also killed.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.041
"they have turned a wedding
into a funeral pyre," he said.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.844
"our revenge
will be unprecedented."

14:05.846 --> 14:06.945
Fuck you, too.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.713
Katie, fly a reaper over the ao.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.683
I want to see ground zero
in the light of day.
On it.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.652
Well, at least we got
confirmation of haqqani's death.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.287
Yeah, but if this
wedding's for real,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.790
Nobody's gonna
give a shit.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.537
<i>I saw the kill list</i>

14:32.539 --> 14:33.872
After 9/11.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.307
Do you know
how many names were on it?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.876
Seven.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.978
Including bin laden
and al-zawahiri.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.547
You know how many names
are on it today?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.682
Over 2,000.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.219
It's alice
in fucking wonderland.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.256
You don't even have to be a
terrorist anymore, apparently.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.591
You just have to
look like one.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.526
Where's sandy anyway?

14:55.528 --> 14:57.161
He said he's coming.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.597
Where is it written that
an ambassador must spend 90%

14:59.599 --> 15:02.200
Of her time cleaning up
after her chief of station?

15:02.202 --> 15:03.434
Nowhere,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.036
But it is the case
almost everywhere.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.271
Well, we get along.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.072
Why can't you be
my station chief?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.407
Sorry I'm late.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.009
Peter has just been
filling me in

15:11.011 --> 15:13.211
On the well-wishers gathering
outside our front gate.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.453
I saw that. Hey, peter.
I've also got
the foreign minister

15:15.477 --> 15:17.515
On my call sheet.
What can I tell him?

15:17.517 --> 15:18.850
That haissam haqqani's dead.

15:18.852 --> 15:19.784
I know that already.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.185
What else?

15:21.187 --> 15:25.456
It's pure pr bullshit,
the wedding claim.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.425
Technically, it wasn't
even a drone strike.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.693
Technically?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.595
It was a bombing run.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.931
Two f-15es.
You're right.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.034
I don't think I'll share that
with the foreign minister.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.002
But just
so I'm clear...

15:39.371 --> 15:41.372
Somebody high up
in the pakistani government

15:41.374 --> 15:43.141
Signed off on this, right?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.609
Oh, come on, martha.
What?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.145
It's their airspace,
their sovereignty.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.114
They scream bloody murder, but
it's theater, it's face-saving.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.250
They want these assholes dead
as much as we do.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.572
They're a little less
enthusiastic

15:53.596 --> 15:54.552
When we kill civilians.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.794
Haqqani was a
legitimate target.

15:55.818 --> 15:57.121
Everybody in
that farmhouse

15:57.123 --> 15:59.057
Had to know who he was,
a marked man.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.993
He put their lives at risk,
not us.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.199
Can you get in closer?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.885
Who's he? Do we recognize him?

20:20.887 --> 20:23.487
I think he's just a
kid from the village.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.428
Well, he's definitely
spotted us.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.242
You want me
to go with him?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.345
No, stay here. See if you can
I.D. Any of the casualties.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.280
You got it.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.854
Jesus, there were

20:56.856 --> 21:00.024
A lot more people in
the farmhouse than we thought.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.096
Hey, chief. A call for you.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.239
Hello?

21:15.241 --> 21:16.607
Carrie, it's quinn.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.875
Quinn.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.210
Long time.

21:19.212 --> 21:20.978
Yeah.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.546
What a clusterfuck, huh?

21:22.548 --> 21:23.881
How you holding up?

21:23.883 --> 21:25.583
It was a taliban spokesperson.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.618
I'm trying not
to get too worked up about it.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.388
Yeah, we got protesters
outside the embassy here.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.890
They pull this shit all the
time. If it wasn't a wedding,

21:32.892 --> 21:34.992
They'd say it was a mosque
we hit or a...

21:34.994 --> 21:37.261
Orphanage
or a mosque for orphans.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.630
Uh, this one
feels different somehow.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.499
Why?

21:41.501 --> 21:43.501
The time frame,
the way we went in.

21:43.503 --> 21:46.437
The fact we didn't have eyes-on
before we ordered the strike.

21:46.439 --> 21:50.074
Well, way to stay positive.

21:53.912 --> 21:55.780
You still there?

21:55.782 --> 21:57.181
Yeah, I'm here.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.683
Listen to me, quinn,

21:58.685 --> 22:01.419
It was a wedding.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.988
Obviously not ideal.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.357
But dande darpa khel's about
as deep in the tribal area

22:06.359 --> 22:07.658
As you can get.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.294
I'm-I'm not following you.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.596
Who's gonna risk going in
to verify anything?

22:12.598 --> 22:15.266
Nobody, that's who.

22:15.268 --> 22:17.668
We're bulletproof on this.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.438
Bulletproof?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.907
Completely.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.551
Sorry.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.721
We missed the 4:00.
Did you get my text?

22:36.723 --> 22:39.957
I did. Thank you.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.959
We sat on the platform
at trenton for over an hour.

22:41.983 --> 22:43.294
Can you grab
those wine glasses?

22:43.296 --> 22:45.663
Yeah. I really wanted
to be here.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.897
I know.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.733
It's just,
michael's my boss, and...

22:48.735 --> 22:51.202
Well, I'll call him tomorrow,
I'll explain everything.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.404
Thank you.

22:56.174 --> 22:59.477
Everybody thinks we should buy
that apartment on 103rd.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.412
Really?
Yeah.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.514
What's wrong
with renting?

23:03.516 --> 23:04.715
It's not committing.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.484
So we keep our
options open.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.352
Come on, saul.
You promised to give new york

23:08.354 --> 23:10.087
At least three years.
Three years?

23:10.089 --> 23:12.690
I'll be pickled
and on the top shelf by then.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.991
Don't say that.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.760
Honestly.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.029
It's not working out with aaron.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.531
Are you gonna get fired?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.999
Is that what you're saying?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.401
No.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.837
It's just,
I really screwed up today.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.773
Then unscrew yourself.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.374
You go in tomorrow morning,

23:30.376 --> 23:33.511
You apologize,
you do whatever it takes.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.679
Mira...
No.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.615
It's my turn.
We agreed.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.250
Mira.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.853
Aayan.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.456
Where have you been?
We thought you...

25:25.458 --> 25:27.825
Yeah. Well, I'm not.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.060
We've been texting you for days.
Why didn't you answer?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.329
I don't know.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.398
I don't know
anything anymore.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.234
Hey, are you all right?

25:41.006 --> 25:43.307
I feel like a ghost.

25:52.485 --> 25:54.718
Lost them all.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.391
Whole family.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.789
Hey, can I talk to you?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.857
If you're interested
in the ballgame, sure.

26:33.859 --> 26:35.392
If not,
you're wasting your time.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.595
None of the above.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.201
Well, you're pretty enough.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.736
I'll say that for you.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.739
You're mathison,
chief of station.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.141
Who are you?

26:51.143 --> 26:54.044
First lieutenant
j.G. Edgars.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.746
Uh, well, you got
my name right,

26:55.748 --> 26:58.248
But I'm not agency; I'm an fso
in the political section.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.817
Bullshit.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.619
Ma'am.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.722
What do you want, lieutenant?

27:04.724 --> 27:06.924
You know me as smash 12.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.860
I flew the mission
into pakistan the other night.

27:11.896 --> 27:15.165
Hey, why don't you sit down.
Let me buy you a beer.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.334
No, thanks.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.509
Is it true
what they're saying?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.511
It was a wedding party?

27:29.314 --> 27:31.248
I don't know.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.184
Even if I did,
I couldn't tell you.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.987
Well, I feel sick
to my stomach about it.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.758
Yeah.
You?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.027
You ever feel that...
sick to your stomach?

27:46.464 --> 27:48.699
Sometimes.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.670
I try to see the big picture,
though. The mission.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.539
It was a wedding, wasn't it?

27:55.541 --> 27:57.207
I told you, I don't know.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.877
I killed four canadian soldiers
in January on bad orders,

27:59.879 --> 28:03.347
Dropped a 200-pound bomb
on their heads.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.451
I'm sorry. I really am.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.386
Monsters.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.155
Wh-what did you say?

28:11.157 --> 28:14.291
Fucking monsters, all of you.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.128
Get the fuck out of my face,
lieutenant.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.868
Yes, ma'am.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.750
Most countries
are run by madmen.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.685
This one is no different.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.253
Hey, keep your voice down.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.822
Why? Who do you think
is listening?

28:44.824 --> 28:46.784
No one will listen
if you keep shouting like that.

28:46.808 --> 28:47.691
I'm not shouting.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.193
Is this a
study group?

28:49.195 --> 28:51.428
Do we not have
an exam tomorrow?

28:51.430 --> 28:54.064
I don't know how you can study
after what's happened.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.333
Yeah, well, it's much better

28:56.335 --> 28:59.269
Than being sad
all the time, so...

28:59.271 --> 29:02.206
Well, the american ambassador
was on tv

29:02.208 --> 29:03.440
Again this morning.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.842
So?

29:04.844 --> 29:07.845
She's still saying
there was no wedding,

29:07.847 --> 29:09.446
That it never happened.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.448
For the last time, rahim, no.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.584
But they are dishonoring
your family.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.552
People must know the truth.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.154
He honors his
family by continuing

29:17.178 --> 29:19.456
His studies, huh?
And becoming a doctor.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.358
We can upload the video
anonymously,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.080
If that's what you're both
so worried about.

29:23.104 --> 29:24.061
I said, no.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.629
No video,
no nothing.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.964
But it's the right thing to do.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.967
It's politics.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.402
I want no part of it.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.439
Well, I don't know
why I'm surprised.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.874
And what's that supposed
to mean?

29:36.876 --> 29:39.209
Oh, I should know by now
who I'm dealing with.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.444
Cowards.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.138
Hello.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.439
Carrie mathison?

30:09.441 --> 30:10.774
Speaking.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.743
Hold for director lockhart,
please.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.478
Carrie, you awake?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.013
Uh, kind of.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.981
You been online this morning?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.117
No.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.352
Well, dande darpa khel's
gone viral.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.856
Uh, say that again.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.424
300,000 hits.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.027
Video's only been up
for a couple hours.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.461
What does it show?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.330
A wedding, little girls dancing.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.699
A bride and her mother,
and then the missiles hit.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.167
It's devastating.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.502
Authentic?

30:38.504 --> 30:39.970
Sure as hell looks that way.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.772
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.809
Have you talked to sandy?

30:45.811 --> 30:47.711
He was my first call.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.347
You two are gonna have
to put your heads together,

30:50.349 --> 30:52.282
Find me a way to spin this.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.186
Well, why not come clean,
say we got the target right,

30:56.188 --> 30:58.121
But the wedding
was an honest mistake?

30:58.123 --> 30:59.957
That's not gonna cut it.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.439
It has the benefit
of being the truth.

31:01.463 --> 31:02.960
Look, carrie,

31:02.962 --> 31:04.962
The president's apoplectic,
I'm not far behind, and

31:04.986 --> 31:08.198
The pakistan armed forces want
a full accounting by tomorrow.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.200
Whatever you need, sir.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.835
What I need

31:11.837 --> 31:15.038
Is you on the first transport
down to islamabad.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.964
I'm assuming this was you?

32:46.966 --> 32:48.131
You did this?

32:50.135 --> 32:51.435
It had to be done.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.570
Take it down right now.
It's too late.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.272
Half a million people
have already watched.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.907
Rahim, I don't care.
Just do it.

32:56.909 --> 32:58.642
Anyway, I can't.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.843
What do you mean, you can't?

32:59.845 --> 33:01.411
It was my cousin
who uploaded it.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.814
Your cousin?!
Oh, what?

33:03.816 --> 33:05.115
He knows the internet.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.850
He masked the ip
using a proxy server.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.251
What does that even mean?!

33:08.253 --> 33:09.853
Means, don't worry so much.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.422
No one will ever be able
to trace it back to you.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.624
Of course they will, rahim!
I'm in the video!

33:14.626 --> 33:16.026
Any idiot could join those dots.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.295
So you'll be famous then.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.564
You know, fuck you...

33:24.202 --> 33:26.269
Call your cousin.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.539
Tell him to take
it down. Now.

33:29.541 --> 33:30.541
Call him!

33:30.542 --> 33:32.376
Okay, okay!

33:50.828 --> 33:52.195
Hey.
Yeah.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.897
What's signals saying?

33:53.899 --> 33:56.066
Well, there's heavy traffic
on social media sites

33:56.068 --> 33:58.168
And cellular services,
so no doubt about it.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.370
We're gonna have
street demonstrations later on.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.372
Any more on who
put out that video?

34:02.374 --> 34:04.254
We'll have a name for you
by the end of the day.

34:04.278 --> 34:05.475
You believe this?

34:05.477 --> 34:07.344
I mean, what are
the fucking odds?

34:07.346 --> 34:09.079
The ambassador's
demanding a sit-down

34:09.081 --> 34:10.380
With the entire station.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.683
Tell her after lunch.
She wants before.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.319
Well, tell her there's no point
till mathison gets here.

34:16.321 --> 34:17.440
I'm picking her up at 12:30.

34:17.465 --> 34:18.588
Okay, that works.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.824
Hold on a second.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.672
All right, let me know when
mathison gets in the building.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.609
I will. Where you going?
Lie down. I feel like shit.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.878
Guts again?
Yeah. Is a normal
bowel movement

34:41.880 --> 34:43.513
Too much to ask for?

36:00.625 --> 36:02.859
Hey.
Hey.

36:06.430 --> 36:09.633
Welcome to pakistan.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.868
Uh, can we sit for ten minutes?

36:11.870 --> 36:13.837
You give me the lay of the land?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.373
Sure.

36:16.375 --> 36:17.941
The ambassador's out front
with the locals on this,

36:17.943 --> 36:19.009
So she's pissed.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.310
Oh, I can't say
I blame her.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.045
Sandy's intel was
good until now.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.814
What do you
think happened?
No idea.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.449
Not even his own
case officers know

36:26.451 --> 36:28.118
What he's up to
half the time.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.653
Lone wolf.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.655
Leaves the embassy odd hours,
doesn't say where to.

36:31.679 --> 36:32.722
Girlfriend?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.391
Maybe, or maybe
he's meeting the asset

36:34.393 --> 36:36.073
Who's feeding him
these upper-tier targets.

36:36.097 --> 36:39.029
So who is this
asset of his?

36:39.031 --> 36:40.997
Thought you knew.
Nope.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.919
I have no clue either,
so you'll have to ask him.

36:42.943 --> 36:44.401
Well, I will,
'cause I'm the one

36:44.403 --> 36:46.236
Dropping fire on
all these people.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.971
Yeah, well, I know
what that's like.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.839
What?

36:49.841 --> 36:52.809
Checking names off a kill list
for a living.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.846
It's a job.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.716
Doesn't bother you?

37:01.519 --> 37:04.521
What about
when it goes wrong?

37:04.523 --> 37:06.056
Doesn't happen that often.

37:06.058 --> 37:09.092
But it did this time.

37:09.094 --> 37:12.028
They were haqqani's family.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.597
They knew who he was.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.399
They knew the chance
they were taking being there.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.702
Sandy said the same thing.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.170
Well, he provides
the coordinates,

37:20.172 --> 37:21.371
I fly the missions.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.440
We make a good team.

37:27.211 --> 37:29.446
I guess istanbul
was too tame for you.

37:29.448 --> 37:32.782
Well, I was looking forward
to it, but kabul opened up.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.085
It's a hardship post.
It's more money.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.587
Like you care about that.
It's more action.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.856
But you can't bring dependents.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.764
I wanted to bring you.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.000
Why didn't you come?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.637
We should get you
to the embassy.

38:02.313 --> 38:04.981
Quinn.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.655
Station chief
sandy bachman...

38:11.657 --> 38:14.658
Fucking hell. Come on.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.266
Hello.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.101
Sandy, it's quinn.
Where are you?

40:05.103 --> 40:06.403
In the residence.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.965
No, you're not.
Security was just there.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.440
Okay. I'm off campus.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.842
Listen to me carefully, sandy.
You are blown.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.577
Somebody leaked your picture
to the press.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.413
What?

40:16.415 --> 40:18.047
We need to bring you in now.

40:18.049 --> 40:21.418
I have to know exactly
where you are.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.786
Did you hear me, sandy?

40:22.788 --> 40:24.888
Your face is all over
the goddamn tv news.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.623
Yes.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.291
Where are you?

40:28.293 --> 40:30.727
I'm on korang road in I-9.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.429
- Did you take a vehicle?
- No.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.397
What's the intersection?
Street 10.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.466
Okay, we can be there
in five minutes.

40:36.468 --> 40:37.801
Keep your damn phone on.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.139
Found him. He's in the field.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.808
Corner of korang road
and street 10.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.376
I'm on my way, but send a squad.

40:46.378 --> 40:49.045
Copy that.

41:16.907 --> 41:19.242
Hey, hey!

42:11.562 --> 42:14.097
Hey!

42:28.479 --> 42:30.580
Back! Back! Back!

42:32.516 --> 42:33.683
Get back!

42:33.685 --> 42:35.885
Go! Go! Go!

42:39.523 --> 42:40.657
Fuck!
Shit!

42:43.028 --> 42:44.727
Quinn, go!

42:46.765 --> 42:48.731
I can't.
There's another weapon in back.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.569
Base, this is sandy.
Contact with maybe

42:52.571 --> 42:54.604
A hundred locals
on street 10 and korang road.

42:54.606 --> 42:57.774
Ask him how far out
the squad is.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.375
There's no gun back here, quinn.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.344
It's under the seat!
It's not here!

43:01.346 --> 43:03.246
Goddamn it.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.916
Goddamn it!

43:06.918 --> 43:08.484
Let him go!

43:14.792 --> 43:16.125
Get off me!

43:16.127 --> 43:17.493
Get back!

43:23.969 --> 43:25.468
Goddamn it! Help me!

43:25.470 --> 43:26.803
Help!

43:29.074 --> 43:31.107
Quinn!

43:32.109 --> 43:33.977
Quinn!

43:37.915 --> 43:39.415
Carrie, no!

43:39.417 --> 43:40.917
We can't leave him!
He's gone!

43:40.919 --> 43:43.186
There's nothing more we can do!
Now get down!

44:53.791 --> 44:55.825
Come on.
Just give me a minute.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.193
We don't have a minute.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.555
The ambassador needs
to be briefed.

44:58.579 --> 45:00.196
Yeah, well, I
need a minute.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.397
Plus, the director's gonna want
an after-action report asap.

45:01.399 --> 45:02.719
We need to get
our story straight.

45:02.743 --> 45:05.301
Carrie, give me
a goddamn minute.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.570
Okay.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.909
What do you mean, story?

45:14.311 --> 45:16.245
You know what I mean.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.314
We could have done more
back there.

45:18.316 --> 45:19.749
You kidding me?

45:19.751 --> 45:22.618
No, I'm not.
It was within our power.

45:25.055 --> 45:26.823
You know what? Fuck you.

45:26.825 --> 45:30.259
No, really, carrie.
Fuck you.

45:30.261 --> 45:32.428
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

45:32.430 --> 45:34.597
What is wrong with you?

45:37.267 --> 45:39.469
Five minutes. Inside.

45:45.209 --> 45:47.510
I'm carrie mathison.
I need to see the ambassador.

45:47.512 --> 45:51.581
Ma'am, you have blood all
over the side of your face.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.616
Where's the bathroom?

45:53.618 --> 45:55.618
To your right.
