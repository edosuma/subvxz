WEBVTT

00:09.139 --> 00:11.185
Tell me his fuckin' name!

00:12.882 --> 00:14.231
The things we do for money,
my little brother.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.885
Red! Don't fuckin' move.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.713
-Marco?
-Blaine.

00:17.843 --> 00:19.715
'Cause I'm getting doubtful
we're ever gonna find any gold.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.760
All this time we've been
sitting over a gold mine.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.110
That gold is evil.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.502
How much do you reckon
it would be worth?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.200
We just gonna run away.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.853
With all this money,
we won't survive till sundown.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.072
This is our town.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.553
We'll see you here
tomorrow morning.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.729
My brother has been found,
and I'm gonna go get him.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.687
Nothing matters
outside of us.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.124
Marco matters.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.878
Now you know his name.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.066
Stupid boy.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.329
Fuck are you doing here?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.898
-My mother.
-Your mother what?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.602
Wait here.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.517
How else...

03:33.648 --> 03:36.477
...am I supposed to
entertain myself?

03:36.607 --> 03:38.435
-Try me.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.353
Look who's here.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.704
You the new sheriff, buddy?

03:48.793 --> 03:49.707
No.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.189
But you say you
gonna entertain me?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.278
Let go of me.

03:57.628 --> 04:01.110
Well, I have a game
you might like.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.289
Well, if I like it,

04:06.420 --> 04:08.944
I might just let
you live, my friend.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.293
But if I don't...

04:23.219 --> 04:25.177
Are you going to protect us now?

04:26.875 --> 04:28.529
-Are you kidding?
-Why not?

04:28.659 --> 04:30.835
We have been
terrorized for days,

04:30.966 --> 04:33.925
and you look like someone who
can take care of this madness.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.492
This ain't my town.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.233
It's yours.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.192
Here, take care of it yourself.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.282
But you killed
our sheriff, right?

04:42.412 --> 04:43.544
You owe it to us.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.546
No.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.330
I did not kill your sheriff.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.379
And I don't owe you nothin'.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.012
Go away.

05:18.187 --> 05:21.799
Michelle, Dorian?

05:21.930 --> 05:24.324
Dorian, look, look.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.458
That's beautiful, huh?

05:33.245 --> 05:35.378
Hey, that's beautiful.

05:37.989 --> 05:38.990
Here you go.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.479
I want a sample
exactly like this

05:49.610 --> 05:52.874
from every other hole
we made in Hagan's land.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.920
-Right away.
-You want.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.750
You want, you want.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.404
Excuse me?

06:01.535 --> 06:03.406
No, excuse me, asshole.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.758
I'm getting tired
of you talking to us

06:07.889 --> 06:10.326
like we're a couple
of mangy dogs.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.849
Hey.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.118
Now.

06:20.249 --> 06:24.035
You better pray you find that
great vein of yours tomorrow,

06:24.166 --> 06:25.907
because if by then
you haven't made good

06:26.037 --> 06:29.301
on the work we
done for you, well,

06:29.432 --> 06:32.000
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to start treating you

06:32.130 --> 06:34.655
like the bankrupt, worthless,

06:34.785 --> 06:38.180
goddamn piece of
shit that you are.

07:05.294 --> 07:08.340
Don't you know it's dangerous
to sneak up on an armed man?

07:10.952 --> 07:12.519
I wasn't sneaking.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.178
What do you want now?

07:20.309 --> 07:21.963
Thought you chopped
everyone's heads off.

07:22.093 --> 07:26.097
Only the people who annoy
me twice in the same day.

07:27.751 --> 07:28.926
You should've given
the gun to me.

07:29.057 --> 07:32.321
I need to protect my mother.
I can learn.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.888
Maybe if I practice enough,
I could be like you.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.590
-What's your name, kid?
-Tod.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.505
Well, Tod, there are
better men than me around.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.638
But you stole the
sheriff's horse.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.378
There ain't no one
better than you.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.511
-Did you kill him?
-No.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.513
Then do you think
he'll come back?

07:50.644 --> 07:52.820
I mean, what are we gonna
do if he doesn't come back?

07:52.950 --> 07:55.779
-I mean--
-Look, kid. I'm not the right
person to get you, McCoy,

07:55.910 --> 07:58.347
-or anyone else out of trouble.
-Why not?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.874
'Cause I've got a job to do.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.136
I need to find someone
I've been looking for

08:05.267 --> 08:06.834
for a very long time.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.055
And there's nothing
I can do for you.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.408
Now, for Christ's sakes,
would you just...

08:16.539 --> 08:18.541
not say anything for
a couple of minutes?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.937
All right?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.353
Are you lost, little brother?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.051
Don't be scared.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.969
Ah, remember the fun
we had with Blaine?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.406
Too bad we don't have
that anymore, right?

09:41.537 --> 09:43.844
-Shut up.
-But don't worry.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.934
The only reason I'm
here is to help you.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.589
Leave me alone,
I don't need your help.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.634
Don't need my help?

09:51.765 --> 09:53.636
Don't you remember
who found you?

09:53.767 --> 09:57.074
My men.
On my orders.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.686
So I could come and take care
of you like I always did.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.862
Keep away from me,
you piece of shit.

10:03.603 --> 10:09.217
Oh, Marco, you're
gonna be all right.

10:09.347 --> 10:12.873
Just remember the good old days.

10:14.831 --> 10:19.706
The things we did to survive.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.780
I told you.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.870
Pointless looking,
he ain't coming back.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.657
And I say we can
wait a little longer.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.582
Did you know about
Bronson having a brother?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.067
And?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.808
You never asked him about it?

11:19.853 --> 11:22.812
Christ.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.685
You never give a shit
about anything, do ya?

11:30.602 --> 11:33.344
-I was told--
-What?

11:33.475 --> 11:35.042
You worked for
Buffalo Bill's Circus.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.481
Is that true?

11:43.441 --> 11:44.965
Yeah.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.534
It's true.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.711
Why are you asking?

11:51.841 --> 11:53.190
You're interested in joining?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.477
Know the best way to find
a needle in a haystack?

13:05.393 --> 13:07.917
Burn the whole
fuckin' thing down.

13:09.179 --> 13:12.226
One bale at a time.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.925
You destroy everything,
'till it's by itself.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.936
And when you find the man
that killed your mama,

13:28.372 --> 13:29.896
and you kill him,

13:32.550 --> 13:34.944
you'll be the last man standing.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.818
All alone.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.329
Tod.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.910
He was pointing a gun at me.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.655
Let go, let go of me.

14:33.785 --> 14:34.656
Goddamn it.

14:34.786 --> 14:37.572
He came up behind me.

14:37.702 --> 14:40.967
He was armed, it's not my fault.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.751
It's not my fault.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.938
No.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.551
Why did you give him the gun?

15:01.639 --> 15:03.337
I didn't.

15:03.467 --> 15:07.819
He just wanted to
protect me. That's all.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.257
I said where's our sheriff,
you goddamned murderer?

15:13.782 --> 15:15.349
Where's our sheriff?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.122
You know
when you find the man

15:49.252 --> 15:51.559
that killed your mama...

15:51.689 --> 15:53.604
Leave us alone.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.651
You'll be
the last man standing.

15:58.479 --> 15:59.654
All alone.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.445
Come on, Red.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.881
One last push.

16:29.814 --> 16:32.382
Hey, hey, what the
hell you doing?

16:32.513 --> 16:35.559
I'm gonna get your
fucking sheriff for you.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.538
I told you,

16:57.668 --> 16:59.453
we only set up
a couple of months ago.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.846
We haven't made a
single dollar yet.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.892
Ain't that a
coincidence, my friend.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.026
'Cause I'm having a pretty
tough time with money too.

17:07.156 --> 17:10.507
So, if you'll extend
a helping hand

17:10.638 --> 17:12.509
and some credit for
some possible supplies

17:12.640 --> 17:14.294
that may come in handy,
like some bullets,

17:14.424 --> 17:18.863
some whiskey, and
maybe a decent horse.

17:18.994 --> 17:22.432
There's a mare in the
stable, but I need it.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.695
-Gloria's gonna be
givin' birth soon--
-I need it, Oliver!

17:24.826 --> 17:27.655
I need it for this particularly
hard time in my life.

17:27.785 --> 17:31.224
I need the horse. I'm still
the sheriff of Greenvale.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.748
So you told me, Sir.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.185
But I don't see a
star on your chest.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.762
Excuse me?

17:49.416 --> 17:52.593
Look, if we're gonna
talk about this,

17:52.723 --> 17:55.291
I don't think we need
her in here, do we?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.080
No.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.951
I'm sorry.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.735
Good luck with the birth.

18:09.523 --> 18:10.741
Hmm.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.700
A Winchester, huh?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.354
That's right.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.705
If my memory serves
me correctly,

18:17.835 --> 18:19.794
pretty reliable gun.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.580
Let me ask you this, are
you quick enough, son?

18:25.539 --> 18:27.845
'Cause that pretty
young lady in there

18:27.976 --> 18:30.239
doesn't look like she's
ready for widowhood.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.469
It wouldn't take
more than two or three days.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.818
All we got to do is
hop on a wagon train

18:43.948 --> 18:44.993
bound for St. Louis.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.647
That's not a bad idea.

18:46.777 --> 18:49.258
Kansas?
You serious?

18:49.389 --> 18:52.218
Sure. Once we're there I'll buy
a herd of cattle with Symone.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.394
We'll triple our
share in no time.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.570
No, Symone is coming with me.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.876
We're opening a
wedding dress store.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.271
What? Symone agreed
to help me, didn't you?

19:02.402 --> 19:04.055
She's the only one
who knows arithmetic,

19:04.186 --> 19:05.840
and if we can't count
money, we can't do business.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.365
I agree.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.371
Where are you going?

19:15.502 --> 19:17.808
I'm gonna give the
horses some water.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.506
If they die of thirst,

19:19.636 --> 19:20.724
we'll be stuck here
the rest of our lives.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.773
I think our only plan,
for now, should be

19:25.903 --> 19:28.123
to stop at the first
big town we come across,

19:28.254 --> 19:29.690
clean all this dust off us.

19:29.820 --> 19:30.604
Sounds good.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.069
Dorian, that's enough.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.943
Please, Michelle.

20:49.073 --> 20:52.294
I'm not gonna leave until you
come out and see for yourself.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.692
It's an ocean of green.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.828
And it's so beautiful.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.357
Please, Michelle.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.192
Michelle?

21:24.457 --> 21:27.373
You have every reason
in the world to hate me.

21:36.295 --> 21:41.212
I promise, it's not
forgiveness I'm looking for.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.530
Just come see what
I have to show you.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.578
Huh?

24:14.409 --> 24:16.280
You gonna shoot me, Sheriff?

24:16.411 --> 24:18.718
Take another step and I will.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.157
I only wanna talk.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.115
Talk about what?

24:25.246 --> 24:26.465
You can put that down.

24:28.902 --> 24:29.946
I ain't putting nothing down.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.776
Thank you very much.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.648
I bet you feel all smug.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.171
You know, just like
a million dollars,

24:37.301 --> 24:38.825
while I look like
a piece of shit.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.305
This is not how I
thought I'd find you.

24:41.436 --> 24:45.962
I thought you'd either
be dead or filthy rich.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.530
Not stinking drunk and alone.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.665
I'm not drunk.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.536
And I'm certainly not alone.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.235
Why did you come back here?

24:58.366 --> 25:01.674
That town of yours is
tearing itself apart.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.545
That town of mine?
That town of mine.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.242
Well, I don't
give a flying fuck.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.896
They can all go burn
in hell for all I care.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.115
I never liked any of 'em anyway.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.203
Actually, that's not true.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.119
Mm-hmm, there was one girl.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.729
Eve, was her name.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.605
Clever bitch. I liked her.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.216
Although, she--

25:22.346 --> 25:24.261
She left me for a farmer,
can you believe that?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.568
Farmer, Farmer Steve.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.614
Now I asked her why.

25:28.744 --> 25:29.397
And she said I
wouldn't understand.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.964
And you know what?

25:31.094 --> 25:33.706
She was right,
I didn't understand.

25:33.836 --> 25:37.361
But she's dead now,
so it doesn't matter.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.625
-Hmm.
-And of course...

25:41.278 --> 25:42.541
That's enough.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.633
Now, sit down.

25:54.509 --> 25:56.598
It's all your fault, Red.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.472
If it hadn't been for you,

26:02.952 --> 26:04.388
I'd be sitting on my boat,

26:04.519 --> 26:07.043
half-way across the
world counting my money.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.308
Why did you come back?

26:11.439 --> 26:13.397
I already told you.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.443
Oh, come on.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.054
Greenvale can't be that
important to you, can it?

26:21.101 --> 26:22.450
It isn't.

26:23.538 --> 26:24.931
But they need you.

26:27.847 --> 26:31.328
Well, I don't give
a flying fuck.

26:31.459 --> 26:32.678
All right.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.331
See, I missed my
train for nothing.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.637
What train?

26:35.768 --> 26:37.291
The train to Trenton
and South Bar

26:37.421 --> 26:39.206
to see if there's a
more reliable sheriff...

26:39.336 --> 26:41.425
-Oh, I see.
-...who actually uses
their bounty board.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.124
You're trying to find out how
much Bronson's head's worth?

26:44.254 --> 26:46.692
-Goodbye, Sheriff.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.868
It ain't worth shit,
you wanna know why?

26:48.998 --> 26:50.696
'Cause there's no bounty
on Bronson's head.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.915
You wanna know why? 'Cause
there ain't no bounty out there

26:53.046 --> 26:54.308
'cause it's all in here.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.489
Wanna make a deal?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.319
No trickery.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.321
No double-crossing,
I'm serious.

27:08.191 --> 27:08.888
And on my terms.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.502
Fuck your terms.

27:19.289 --> 27:20.334
You hungry, Red?

27:32.955 --> 27:34.870
Sorry, kids.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.611
I've got another favor to ask.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.134
My friend's just showed up

27:38.265 --> 27:40.571
and would you mind terribly

27:40.702 --> 27:42.661
if you could cook
us some dinner?

27:43.879 --> 27:45.533
Oh and...

27:46.403 --> 27:48.057
Do you have a shirt?

27:48.188 --> 27:49.711
My size?

28:18.305 --> 28:20.699
Well, I must say, I'd
expect the future governor

28:20.829 --> 28:24.180
to drive with
at least a butler.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.486
Luxury coach.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.140
Private train.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.620
Butlers, why?

28:29.751 --> 28:31.405
The wheels of
bureaucracy are slowly

28:31.535 --> 28:33.320
and train seats,
they hurt my ass.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.191
Oh.

28:37.585 --> 28:41.241
Well, here we are again.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.199
The old gang
is back together.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.159
We're gonna have some fun.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.596
The old way.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.206
The old way?

28:53.035 --> 28:54.558
Welcome home, Bronson.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.647
Can you believe it, Vonnet?

28:58.867 --> 29:00.564
My brother. Hey!

29:16.624 --> 29:17.756
I'm sorry.

29:21.716 --> 29:22.673
Relax.

29:44.957 --> 29:46.001
Oh, right.

30:02.496 --> 30:05.673
I'm sorry, I should've shot
it in the head, but...

30:05.804 --> 30:07.066
it was too far away.

30:09.242 --> 30:09.851
How far?

30:12.201 --> 30:14.290
80, a 100 yards maybe.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.828
I gotta thank you.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.873
For not shooting
a desperate man.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.530
You have married a good man.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.966
Oh, we're not married.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.055
Or not yet, at least.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.624
You should be.

30:47.715 --> 30:50.326
What I'm trying to say is...

30:50.457 --> 30:54.983
When you meet a person,
the right person...

30:55.114 --> 30:57.333
What I'm saying, this is,
uh...

30:57.464 --> 30:59.118
the best damn venison
I've ever eaten.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.862
That's a nice thing to say.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.799
You got it from the
Sheriff's, didn't you?

31:33.065 --> 31:34.718
What?

31:34.849 --> 31:36.329
The gold.

31:36.459 --> 31:39.114
I mean, who the hell
carries nuggets that size

31:39.245 --> 31:40.289
around with them anyway?

31:40.420 --> 31:42.117
It hasn't even been worked.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.034
So?

31:47.035 --> 31:48.384
Is there more?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.392
Well, even if there ain't,

31:56.523 --> 31:58.612
I think I'm owed a part of
that one, what do you say?

31:58.742 --> 32:02.224
I did risk my life to
find that sheriff for you

32:02.355 --> 32:05.053
and I have not seen dollar
one for my troubles.

32:05.184 --> 32:08.100
Now that's not unreasonable,
am I right, Nolan?

32:08.230 --> 32:10.667
-No, Sir.
-No, Sir?

32:10.798 --> 32:11.930
And given the size of the thing,

32:12.060 --> 32:13.844
we'd all do pretty
well out of it.

32:19.807 --> 32:24.507
What you find doing a job
for Bronson is Bronson's.

32:26.553 --> 32:27.858
All right, I get it.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.646
Well, can I at least see it?

32:32.776 --> 32:35.040
You know, there's a lot of
people still not convinced

32:35.170 --> 32:36.650
that all Greenvale's
gold is gone.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.782
Mr. Nolan here's
something of an expert.

32:38.913 --> 32:39.783
-That right, Buddy?
-My uncle.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.134
His uncle was a goldsmith.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.963
Maybe he could tell us if
it's been newly mined or not.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.446
Oh, come on, it's not
like I'm gonna steal it.

32:55.060 --> 32:58.759
Yeah, like a bunch
of little pet dogs.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.239
Fuck it, keep it.

33:02.197 --> 33:03.807
Wanna pass me
those plates, Nolan?

33:03.938 --> 33:05.244
The beans are ready.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.225
All right, we've eaten.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.835
Tell me what you're thinking?

33:31.966 --> 33:34.490
Would you smell that?

33:35.535 --> 33:36.710
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.278
It's not rained here in years.

33:39.408 --> 33:43.673
One downpour and
everything has changed.

33:43.804 --> 33:44.935
What's your point?

33:47.329 --> 33:50.463
When'd you last have
a meal like that? Huh?

33:53.074 --> 33:58.166
Made with the love of a woman.
No guns on the table.

33:58.297 --> 34:01.343
Drinking not to get drunk,
but as a prelude to love.

34:01.474 --> 34:02.736
Get to your point.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.740
My point is...

34:08.002 --> 34:09.351
There is no bounty on Bronson.

34:09.482 --> 34:13.660
He has very powerful
men in high places

34:13.790 --> 34:15.270
that make sure of that.

34:15.401 --> 34:16.924
You think he's
just sitting around

34:17.055 --> 34:17.881
waiting to have his
head chopped off?

34:18.012 --> 34:19.100
No, no, no, no, no, Siree.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.104
So like I said before,

34:25.411 --> 34:26.760
we could help each other.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.111
I don't need your help.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.157
Oh, Red, Red.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.681
I'm afraid to say
that is not...

34:34.811 --> 34:36.552
strictly the truth.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.949
The money.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.951
The Federal money that I...

34:46.127 --> 34:48.347
That was Bronson's money
and those men he sent,

34:50.262 --> 34:52.568
they're gonna kill me.

34:52.699 --> 34:56.355
If truth be told, I don't
stand a goddam chance, so--

34:56.485 --> 34:58.574
Well, that sounds like
your problem, not mine.

34:58.705 --> 35:01.011
Well, if you...

35:01.142 --> 35:03.275
help me deal with them,

35:03.405 --> 35:06.016
I'll take you
straight to Bronson.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.149
-I know where he lives--
-Don't fuck with me.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.331
It's a great big beautiful
mansion in California.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.684
Why are you telling me this now?

35:24.687 --> 35:26.167
I need your help.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.040
And...

35:31.738 --> 35:34.132
I've never met a man who
hates him as much as I do.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.885
Everything okay?

36:32.015 --> 36:34.104
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.685
I can't believe this.

36:51.992 --> 36:55.300
Everyone's already here, look.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.040
But tonight when
the wagon arrives,

36:57.171 --> 36:59.956
he will be the only one missing.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.697
You bet on the wrong horse.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.223
Not necessarily.

37:06.441 --> 37:09.314
We mustn't let it throw us.

37:09.444 --> 37:11.881
He's
disrespected us, Hellen.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.754
Yes.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.191
And he will pay for that
when the time is right.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.714
Why not now?

37:21.239 --> 37:23.284
One word from me
and he'll be dead

37:23.415 --> 37:25.895
before he ever
reaches the border.

37:26.026 --> 37:28.376
I told you...
later.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.120
Nothing must take
precedence over tonight.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.516
We must prepare the crypt.

37:37.646 --> 37:42.129
Tonight's welcome
must be impeccable.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.428
This is our land.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.651
Ours alone.

38:41.797 --> 38:43.190
You done?

38:46.193 --> 38:48.804
Christ, this is getting
old real fucking fast.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.203
I've found it.

39:14.917 --> 39:17.833
Don't you recognize
gold when you see it?

39:19.618 --> 39:21.402
This is the proof
I was looking for.

39:25.841 --> 39:27.452
There.

39:27.582 --> 39:30.411
Their fields, they
run into each other.

39:32.413 --> 39:36.504
Hagan's land is just the
anteroom to the motherlode.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.159
So where is it?

39:39.289 --> 39:41.640
Under Steve's land, like I said.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.598
In fact, I wouldn't
be surprised if it--

39:43.729 --> 39:45.861
--it wasn't right beneath
his goddamn house.

39:47.341 --> 39:49.517
All I can see is
a yellow sliver.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.044
So we're done, then.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.395
What?

39:57.525 --> 39:58.787
And now you know
where the gold is

39:58.918 --> 40:00.485
you can pay us what you owe us.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.318
Open the safe.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.583
Open it.

40:11.713 --> 40:14.368
Open it or I'll bury
you in that graveyard

40:14.499 --> 40:15.674
you visit every day.

40:17.066 --> 40:18.328
Right next to Daddy.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.993
You really don't
believe me, do you?

40:32.865 --> 40:34.562
What you want, congratulations?
Some praise?

40:36.172 --> 40:37.783
You better get it
somewhere else,

40:37.913 --> 40:40.438
'cause we're just about
done with your bullshit.

40:49.185 --> 40:50.665
That's fair enough.

40:52.885 --> 40:56.758
But you know, a pat on the
back every now and again

40:56.889 --> 40:58.325
never hurt anybody.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.500
In fact, some people say,

40:59.631 --> 41:01.459
it's extremely good
for the soul.

41:29.138 --> 41:30.226
Horses are nearly ready.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.707
We're not taking the horses.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.230
Terrain's too rough.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.276
Besides, we're not
going that far.

41:41.890 --> 41:42.543
You know, you're
gonna have to let go

41:42.674 --> 41:44.066
of this bag at some stage.

42:43.082 --> 42:44.866
Are you awake?

42:44.997 --> 42:47.477
Come, come, come,
come to me.

42:49.610 --> 42:54.267
Oh, you are so
beautiful, Matilde.

42:56.095 --> 42:58.488
Oh...

43:03.711 --> 43:04.930
Do you know what this is?

43:08.194 --> 43:09.848
They told you, didn't they?

43:12.459 --> 43:15.070
Now, tell me what
day tomorrow is.

43:18.944 --> 43:20.467
Let me hear your voice.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.166
Tomorrow is the new day.

43:25.559 --> 43:27.779
Keep going.

43:27.909 --> 43:31.130
In which the demons will gather.

43:31.260 --> 43:35.482
In which the darkness will
open the eyes of the blind.

43:37.223 --> 43:40.313
Because we are all sinners.
