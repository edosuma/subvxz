00:01.667 --> 00:04.375
[instrumental music]

00:15.708 --> 00:19.250
Ambassador Kosh, is there
something I can do for you?

00:19.333 --> 00:22.583
I wish to engage your services.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.833
For what?

00:24.917 --> 00:28.083
- Business.
- What sort of business?

00:28.167 --> 00:29.250
Important.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.208
Ambassador,
I'd be happy to assist you

00:31.292 --> 00:32.792
but there are certain details
I must know

00:32.875 --> 00:34.250
before taking any commission.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.833
Not to mention getting
clearances from the..

00:36.917 --> 00:40.875
All arranged. As is payment.

00:40.958 --> 00:45.417
We will meet in Red 3
at the hour of scampering.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.000
"The hour of scampering?"

00:53.833 --> 00:58.125
(female #1)
'Minbari Flyer 969, you may
proceed to Docking Bay 17.'

01:03.167 --> 01:06.208
(male #1)
'Transport Autara
bound for Jupiter colonies'

01:06.292 --> 01:09.667
'is now boarding
at Docking Bay 18.'

01:09.750 --> 01:12.708
Query. Liner Calisto.

01:12.792 --> 01:15.208
(computer)
Liner Calisto will be docking

01:15.292 --> 01:18.250
in Bay 12 in seven minutes.

01:20.042 --> 01:22.625
(male #1)
'All passengers holding berths
on that flight'

01:22.708 --> 01:25.542
'should see Miss Uru in Red 7.'

01:28.083 --> 01:30.875
[speaking in foreign language]

01:40.333 --> 01:41.667
Deathwalker?

01:43.083 --> 01:46.500
Deathwalker. Deathwalker!

01:46.583 --> 01:49.083
[grunting]

02:02.292 --> 02:06.250
Let me go! She must die!
She is Deathwalker!

02:06.333 --> 02:08.708
- Deathwalker!
- Go on, take it easy.

02:11.958 --> 02:15.000
[intense music]

02:18.750 --> 02:22.542
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind..

02:22.625 --> 02:25.500
...ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:25.583 --> 02:29.125
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:29.208 --> 02:32.375
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

02:32.458 --> 02:34.583
where humans and aliens
could work out

02:34.667 --> 02:36.500
their differences peacefully.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.458
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:39.542 --> 02:44.542
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:44.625 --> 02:49.000
Humans and aliens, wrapped in
two million five thousand tons

02:49.083 --> 02:52.833
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.625
It can be a dangerous place.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.750
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:59.833 --> 03:03.625
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:03.708 --> 03:06.083
The year is 2258.

03:06.167 --> 03:10.083
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.500
[theme music]

03:48.208 --> 03:49.250
[intense music]

03:51.208 --> 03:53.000
(Sinclair)
'Have you got
an identity on the victim?'

03:53.083 --> 03:55.583
According to her ship ID,
her name is Gyla Lobos.

03:55.667 --> 03:58.833
She's a free trader. Came from
Sector 47 on her way to Earth.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.792
- That's Minbari space.
- Minbari ship.

04:00.875 --> 04:04.500
Minbari clothes, Minbari ID.
But she's no Minbari.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.833
Na'Toth give any reason
for the attack?

04:06.917 --> 04:08.250
Nothing intelligible.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.958
She was totally berserk
when we hauled her in.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.750
- Kept yelling, "Deathwalker!"
- Deathwalker?

04:12.833 --> 04:15.958
I thought you might remember
that name. I know I do.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.583
(Sinclair)
'Na'Toth, why did you
attack that woman?'

04:27.958 --> 04:30.000
Listen, sister, if she dies,
you'll rot in a cage

04:30.083 --> 04:31.833
until your spots turn gray.

04:31.917 --> 04:35.750
Na'Toth, we want to help you.
But you have to tell us why.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.083
It is Chon-Kar.

04:40.292 --> 04:42.125
The blood oath.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.917
When the Dilgar
conquered Hylak 7

04:44.000 --> 04:46.208
my grandfather
and his family were there.

04:46.292 --> 04:49.292
Deathwalker used them
in her experiments.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.667
'They all died,
except my grandfather'

04:51.750 --> 04:53.917
who managed
to escape back to Narn.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.833
But not before she implanted
a machine in his brain.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.292
It slowly killed
his mind and spirit.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.417
And we could do nothing
but watch.

05:05.125 --> 05:08.000
When he died, my family
took the Chon-Kar.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.292
And now our vengeance
is at hand.

05:10.375 --> 05:13.000
The Dilgar Invasion
was 30 Earth years ago.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.875
If Deathwalker was alive today,
she'd be an old woman.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.708
Her face is carved into
the minds of my entire brood.

05:18.792 --> 05:21.792
I smell my grandfather's blood
on her hands.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.917
I tell you it is she!

05:25.542 --> 05:27.083
Go over to that woman's ship.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.000
I want to know everything
there is to know about her.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.333
You and me both.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.750
Commander Sinclair,
my abject apologies

05:35.833 --> 05:37.083
for this terrible incident.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.417
I don't know what
came over my attache.

05:40.833 --> 05:43.583
Let me ensure you
that I am personally prepared

05:43.667 --> 05:45.208
to make amends to her victim.

05:45.292 --> 05:46.750
Her victim is still in Medlab.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.708
If she lives,
I'll convey your offer.

05:48.792 --> 05:52.417
I see, if you will release
Na'Toth into my custody

05:52.500 --> 05:55.625
I'll take full responsibility
for her conduct.

05:55.708 --> 05:58.083
(Sinclair)
'Given the circumstances,
that's impossible.'

05:58.167 --> 05:59.833
However I will agree
to house arrest

05:59.917 --> 06:02.292
depending outcome
of our investigation.

06:02.375 --> 06:06.083
Guards, take Miss Na'Toth
to Ambassador G'Kar's quarters.

06:06.167 --> 06:07.958
She's not to leave
for any reason.

06:08.042 --> 06:09.167
(male #2)
'Yes, sir.'

06:09.250 --> 06:11.917
You have my gratitude,
commander.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.250
Na'Toth!

06:14.750 --> 06:17.833
[intense music]

06:31.000 --> 06:34.583
Ambassador Kosh, all the
clearances seem to be in order

06:34.667 --> 06:36.792
and the pay is very generous.

06:36.875 --> 06:40.042
However, there's something
I still don't understand.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.958
Understanding
is a three-edged sword.

06:44.042 --> 06:45.708
Oh, Kosh!

06:47.083 --> 06:50.583
You old dog! You didn't tell me
you were bringin' a date.

06:50.667 --> 06:53.292
Um, I'm Talia Winters,
licensed commercial telepath

06:53.375 --> 06:54.708
Psi Corps Rating P-5.

06:54.792 --> 06:56.458
I'll be sittin in
on the negotiations

06:56.542 --> 06:58.250
on behalf of Ambassador Kosh.

06:58.333 --> 07:02.542
Ha! I'm a 23 myself.
A good number.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.833
Call me Abbut.

07:04.917 --> 07:09.250
Please scan Abbut. Report to me
his thoughts at present.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.667
Ooh, goody!

07:10.750 --> 07:14.250
Nothin' like a good mind
scan to clear the old processor.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.708
Miss Winters?

07:23.917 --> 07:26.083
He has no thoughts. At all.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.333
It's as if his mind were empty.

07:30.417 --> 07:35.167
Excellent. We may now
commence our business.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.708
Abbut?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.333
Crab.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.500
Nebula.

07:47.708 --> 07:48.958
[sighs]

07:49.958 --> 07:51.208
Her vital signs have stabilized

07:51.292 --> 07:54.125
but I still can't
match her species type.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.625
Why don't you try
Xenobiogenic 5?

08:01.625 --> 08:03.375
- How is she?
- Better than she should be.

08:03.458 --> 08:06.167
Considering the ferocity
of her attack.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.875
Metabolism is astounding.

08:07.958 --> 08:11.458
It's repairing the damage in an
extremely accelerated rate.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.792
I wish I knew
what her species was.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.542
I've never seen
anything like her.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.792
Her DNA doesn't match anything
we've got on file.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.375
She's a Dilgar.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.292
Dilgar? Dilgar is a dead race.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.208
Those few that were left
after the invasion died

08:23.292 --> 08:24.833
when their sun went nova.

08:24.917 --> 08:28.042
Computer, load history file
EA-22-30.

08:28.125 --> 08:31.958
- Reference, Deathwalker.
- 'Commencing, Deathwalker.'

08:32.042 --> 08:35.333
(computer)
Epithet used to refer
to Jha'dur.

08:35.417 --> 08:38.500
The most infamous leader
of the Dilgar Invasion

08:38.583 --> 08:42.333
of the Non-Aligned Sectors
in 2230.

08:42.417 --> 08:44.375
'Rank, war master.'

08:44.458 --> 08:47.792
'Specialist in biochemical,
biogenetic'

08:47.875 --> 08:49.750
'and cyberorganic weaponry..'

08:49.833 --> 08:53.250
Stop. This was Jha'dur
30 years ago.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.708
(Dr. Stephen)
'Now, she's obviously
too young to be Jha'dur'

08:55.792 --> 08:57.917
and too old to be her daughter.

08:59.625 --> 09:02.333
There might be an explanation.
Now, computer..

09:02.417 --> 09:04.792
Scan subject for any sign
of cryonic freezing

09:04.875 --> 09:06.292
or body alteration.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.625
(computer)
'Commencing. Scan, negative.'

09:09.708 --> 09:13.292
Mm, I'll have MedCorp send me
all their files on the Dilgar.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.250
There has to be a way to make
a positive identification.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.042
Commander..

09:19.125 --> 09:21.000
...you're not gonna
believe this.

09:22.708 --> 09:24.000
A Dilgar uniform.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.667
Rank, war master,
and the nameplate reads Jha'dur.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.750
Na'Toth was right. It's her.

09:28.833 --> 09:32.083
A uniform doesn't prove that.
Did you find anything else?

09:32.167 --> 09:33.458
Only this.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.958
Doesn't look like any kind
of drug I've ever seen. Doc?

09:44.458 --> 09:46.125
Better run some test on this.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.583
My father flew for Earthforce
during the Dilgar Invasion.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.542
He was there
when they re-took Balos.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.708
He never forgot what he saw.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.542
If this woman is Jha'dur, then..

09:59.042 --> 10:00.750
- Sinclair.
- 'Commander.'

10:00.833 --> 10:02.417
(female #2)
'You have a gold channel
transmission'

10:02.500 --> 10:05.000
'from Senator Hidoshi.'

10:05.083 --> 10:06.583
On my way.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.667
Post a full detail here until
she can be moved

10:08.750 --> 10:10.292
to a maximum security area

10:10.375 --> 10:11.792
and keep a tight lid on this,
Michael.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.542
Until we figure out
what's going on

10:13.625 --> 10:17.000
I don't want any rumors running
around in the station.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.375
I'm sorry to bring you shame,
ambassador

10:24.458 --> 10:26.542
but I must fulfill my Chon-Kar.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.375
You do not shame me, Na'Toth.

10:28.458 --> 10:32.875
I know how your senses burn
with the nearness of your prey.

10:32.958 --> 10:35.708
I, too, have Chon-Kar,
many of them.

10:35.792 --> 10:41.042
But unhappily in this case,
yours complicates matters.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.583
I don't understand.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.250
Counselor Ha'rok, the Narn
you were to meet in customs

10:45.333 --> 10:47.500
was here to bargain
with Jha'dur.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.542
Our agents learned
of a discovery she made

10:49.625 --> 10:52.292
which would be of great value
to our regime.

10:52.375 --> 10:54.542
[chuckles]
But after your attack on her

10:54.625 --> 10:56.292
Ha'rok could not hope
to approach her

10:56.375 --> 10:58.833
without drawing attention
of Earth Alliance.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.625
So he has returned to Narn
and left me

11:01.708 --> 11:03.708
to secure this discovery
of hers.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.083
I will take it from her
when I eat her flesh.

11:06.167 --> 11:11.083
No, the Kha'Ri says we must
get her to Narn alive.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.500
I will not be denied this!

11:13.583 --> 11:15.750
This is larger than Chon-Kar!

11:17.042 --> 11:18.917
It would give Narn
the advantage it needs

11:19.000 --> 11:22.083
to expand the regime
and crush our enemies!

11:22.167 --> 11:25.458
You must make this sacrifice
for the future of our people.

11:25.542 --> 11:28.625
As all Narn have sacrificed
at one time or another.

11:31.542 --> 11:35.917
I'll delay the Chon-Kar.
But I will not abandon it!

11:36.000 --> 11:38.667
You would not be Narn
if you did.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.000
I am proud of you.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.792
And when we get what we want
from this butcher

11:43.875 --> 11:46.583
I promise to help you
fulfill your vow.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.167
[dramatic music]

11:58.917 --> 12:01.375
(Hidoshi)
'Commander Sinclair.'

12:01.458 --> 12:04.792
Senator Hidoshi,
what can I do for you?

12:04.875 --> 12:07.417
We understand a woman
named Gyla Lobos

12:07.500 --> 12:09.417
was recently attacked there.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.542
- Is she alive?
- Yes, and recovering.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.292
Excellent,
when she's fit to travel

12:15.375 --> 12:17.500
you will send her
to Earth immediately.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.458
Senator, we've found evidence
that this woman

12:19.542 --> 12:22.125
might be the Dilgar
war criminal, Deathwalker.

12:22.208 --> 12:26.125
[chuckles]
Deathwalker is long dead,
commander.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.500
This is a priority order.

12:28.583 --> 12:32.167
- Without more information, I--
- Commander Sinclair!

12:32.250 --> 12:35.125
All information in this matter
is on a need-to-know basis

12:35.208 --> 12:39.500
and you do not need to know.
Have a pleasant day.

12:44.083 --> 12:47.125
[intense music]

12:52.625 --> 12:54.000
Incredible.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.125
How dare you pry
into my life's work!

13:08.208 --> 13:10.292
- I think you're too badly--
- I've had worse!

13:10.375 --> 13:12.417
I want to see Sinclair now.

13:15.208 --> 13:18.667
Commander!
Commander, is it true?

13:18.750 --> 13:20.083
Is what true?

13:20.167 --> 13:23.250
They say you have
Deathwalker in custody.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.458
You should know better than
to listen to rumors, ambassador.

13:36.833 --> 13:42.750
I'm Commander Jeffrey Sinclair.
You asked to speak to me?

13:42.833 --> 13:45.375
Doctor, will you give us
a moment, please?

13:49.125 --> 13:51.208
You know the way of command.

13:51.292 --> 13:54.208
Yes, the Wind Swords
are right to fear you.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.417
What do you know
about the Wind Swords?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.583
They have sheltered me
for many years.

13:58.667 --> 14:02.125
In return for certain services.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.792
They speak of you often,
Sinclair.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.375
They say you have
a hole in your mind.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.417
Who are you?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.583
I am War Master Jha'dur
of the Dilgar.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.958
- Deathwalker?
- So they called me.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.708
If you were Jha'dur,
you'd be much older.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.500
The answer is in this vial.

14:24.583 --> 14:28.208
The result of a lifetime of
research and experimentation.

14:28.292 --> 14:32.375
My research.
A universal anti-agapic.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.250
I'm not familiar
with the term.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.750
It's a serum which retards
the aging process

14:36.833 --> 14:38.375
and prevents disease.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.792
It's still unstable
and difficult to produce

14:40.875 --> 14:45.458
in sufficient quantity,
but it works as you can see.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.958
No fear of growing old.
No sickness. That's--

14:49.042 --> 14:53.625
Virtual immortality,
the ultimate triumph of life.

14:53.708 --> 14:55.958
The secret is mine, Sinclair

14:56.042 --> 14:57.792
and with the help
of your Earth

14:57.875 --> 15:00.458
I will bring it to all
the worlds of this galaxy

15:00.542 --> 15:02.625
before the year is out.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.625
Then the willows must scuttle
carefully.

15:10.708 --> 15:13.875
Does Saturn have rings?

15:13.958 --> 15:17.708
The talks are over for the day.

15:17.792 --> 15:21.958
We shall commence again tomorrow
at the hour of longing.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.417
Suits me.

15:26.542 --> 15:27.875
Ambassador? Ambassador Kosh?

15:29.833 --> 15:31.958
- There is a question?
- Yes.

15:32.042 --> 15:34.625
I've been scanning Mr. Abbut
all day and his mind

15:34.708 --> 15:36.708
is still just as empty
as when we started.

15:36.792 --> 15:39.000
And these-these phrases
you keep speaking in

15:39.083 --> 15:40.833
they don't make any sense.

15:40.917 --> 15:44.417
- Ah, you seek meaning?
- Yes.

15:47.417 --> 15:51.292
Then listen to the music,
not the song.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.167
Miss Winters,
could I buy you a drink?

15:58.250 --> 16:01.458
A, uh, Jovian Sunspot
would taste good right now.

16:01.542 --> 16:02.750
Mr. Abbut, can you tell me

16:02.833 --> 16:05.042
what these negotiations
are all about?

16:05.125 --> 16:07.375
I could.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.958
But it's not good
to reflect too much.

16:11.208 --> 16:14.250
[intense music]

16:20.375 --> 16:25.042
- A problem?
- Ah! No, I'm just tired.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.542
I think I'll go back to my
quarters and rest for a while.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.208
Ha! Rest is good.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.917
And so is a nice,
lean pastrami

16:31.000 --> 16:34.708
with just a little mustard
and an Antarean pickle.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.583
Maybe another time?

16:39.125 --> 16:42.917
(woman on PA)
'Book Universe on level 5 is
pleased to announce a sig--'

16:43.000 --> 16:45.250
- Mr. Lennier.
- Oh, commander.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.292
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but with Ambassador Delenn

16:47.375 --> 16:49.750
of station, I need your help.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.250
Have you heard about the
incident in customs today?

16:52.333 --> 16:54.750
Yes, I did. Shocking.

16:54.833 --> 16:58.917
The Narn do seem to be
a most passionate people.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.083
Are you familiar with the name
Deathwalker?

17:02.167 --> 17:04.667
Quite.
History is a passion of mine.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.083
As I recall,
she was the most infamous leader

17:07.167 --> 17:10.958
of the Dilgar Invasion of the
Non-Aligned Sectors in 2230.

17:11.042 --> 17:13.083
She was a brilliant scientist
specializing

17:13.167 --> 17:14.917
in biogenetic and cyberorganics.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.500
But she was also
a brutal and sadistic warrior

17:17.583 --> 17:19.500
personally responsible
for countless deaths--

17:19.583 --> 17:23.375
Na'Toth said the woman
she attacked is Deathwalker.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.958
The woman claims she's right.

17:25.042 --> 17:27.500
She also says it was the
Wind Swords who sheltered her

17:27.583 --> 17:28.708
after the invasion.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.625
The Wind Swords.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.750
They are the most militant of
all our warrior castes.

17:33.833 --> 17:35.833
But even they wouldn't harbor
such a beast.

17:35.917 --> 17:37.958
It's possible she was
of service to them.

17:38.042 --> 17:40.125
Could you check with your
government? See what they know?

17:40.208 --> 17:43.333
I cannot speak directly to
the council without permission.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.333
- But I will contact Delenn.
- Thank you.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.125
I also ask that you keep this
information confidential

17:49.208 --> 17:50.625
for the time being.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.875
You may rely on my discretion,
commander.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.458
And in the name
of the Narn regime

17:58.542 --> 18:01.625
I extend our sincerest apologies
for the attack on you.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.000
We are fully prepared to make

18:03.083 --> 18:05.708
whatever reparations
you deem necessary.

18:05.792 --> 18:08.208
And make you
a most handsome offer.

18:08.292 --> 18:11.042
- For what?
- Your discovery, of course.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.333
The anti-agapic.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.542
You're very well-informed,
G'Kar.

18:14.625 --> 18:17.000
Our reports always said
you were clever one.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.583
And a good
resistance leader too.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.458
If Earth Alliance hadn't
taken a hand in our invasion

18:22.542 --> 18:24.042
we might have helped your kind

18:24.125 --> 18:26.292
wipe the Centauri out
completely.

18:26.375 --> 18:28.708
You are also well-informed,
Jha'dur.

18:28.792 --> 18:31.000
But we are not through
with the Centauri yet.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.750
And you can still help us.

18:32.833 --> 18:37.000
Whatever Earth Alliance has
promised you, we will triple.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.167
Tempting.

18:40.083 --> 18:42.875
Grant me one more thing
and I'll consider it.

18:42.958 --> 18:44.458
Name it.

18:44.542 --> 18:48.500
The head of the animal that
attacked me, within the hour.

18:50.375 --> 18:53.417
[intense music]

18:57.250 --> 18:58.500
[laughs]

19:00.792 --> 19:03.125
And based on the data I got
from Earth, she is Jha'dur.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.375
Which barring other explanations
seems to prove

19:05.458 --> 19:07.375
her claim about an anti-agapic.

19:07.458 --> 19:10.208
- Anti-a-what's-ic?
- An immortality serum.

19:10.292 --> 19:11.583
The Russian consortium's
been researching

19:11.667 --> 19:13.542
in the direction
for years with no success.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.042
That's because there ain't
no such animal.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.417
She's lying
to save her skin.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.875
My analysis of the serum
suggests that she isn't.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.292
(Sinclair)
'Earth agrees.'

19:20.375 --> 19:21.542
They've given us
a priority order

19:21.625 --> 19:23.000
to send Jha'dur there
immediately.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.708
They plan to develop
her discovery.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.042
Are you serious?

19:26.125 --> 19:27.542
This woman
made the Durian Massacres look

19:27.625 --> 19:29.917
like a church picnic and
Earth wants to give her a grant?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.458
Justice or immortality?
An intriguing choice.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.958
There is no choice.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.417
Jha'dur infected the entire
population of Latig IV

19:37.500 --> 19:39.042
with Stafford's Plague
just to see how long

19:39.125 --> 19:40.625
it'd take them all to die.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.958
She wiped out entire races,
destroyed whole planets.

19:43.042 --> 19:44.333
Experimented on living being.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.083
Now she wants to make
everybody immortal?

19:47.292 --> 19:49.083
- Why?
- Maybe she's got a conscience?

19:49.167 --> 19:53.083
Unlikely. Tyrants seldom show
remorse for their brutalities.

19:53.167 --> 19:54.208
Let the League deal with her.

19:54.292 --> 19:55.750
We've got her serum,
if it's legit

19:55.833 --> 19:58.250
we can finish
this immortality pill ourselves.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.583
No, the serum's too complex.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.417
It would take years to develop
without her input.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.875
If at all possible.

20:02.958 --> 20:06.083
While I find Earth's moral
stance on this dubious.

20:06.167 --> 20:09.625
They are better equipped to
handle an issue this magnitude.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.958
Ivanova is right.
This one's too big for us.

20:12.042 --> 20:13.667
I want Jha'dur's ship recharged

20:13.750 --> 20:15.958
'and a fighter escort
ready in one hour.'

20:16.042 --> 20:19.042
We'll take her through Blue 5
to avoid any attention.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.167
What the hell
are you doing, Jeff?

20:28.250 --> 20:30.708
- Following orders.
- Whose order stake?

20:30.792 --> 20:32.917
Whatever Jha'dur's peddling
doesn't change what she is.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.375
I know, dammit.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.125
But if Dr. Franklin's right,
her discovery

20:36.208 --> 20:39.333
will bring a future free of
disease, ageing, death.

20:39.417 --> 20:40.792
All across the galaxy.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.958
She can save more lives
than she took.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.625
And she make the deaths
she caused have meaning.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.667
Isn't that worth considering?

20:49.542 --> 20:52.042
You better pray to that God of
ours you're right, Jeff.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.833
Because if any of the
league ambassadors find out

20:53.917 --> 20:57.375
about this deal, they'll tear
Babylon 5 to pieces.

21:09.583 --> 21:11.167
One of our agents
has just informed me

21:11.250 --> 21:13.708
that Sinclair is going to
smuggle Jha'dur off the station.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.125
- What?
- Blast him!

21:15.208 --> 21:16.833
And that infernal female!

21:16.917 --> 21:18.417
She is near, I can smell her.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.917
Free me from this cage
and I'll deal with her.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.542
No, not yet.
There is a better way.

21:26.042 --> 21:29.000
Ambassador G'Kar to speak
to Ambassador Kalika

21:29.083 --> 21:30.708
on a most urgent matter.

21:30.792 --> 21:32.833
(computer)
One moment, ambassador.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.542
Your ship is recharged.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.458
We'll give you a fighter escort
to the vortex

21:45.542 --> 21:48.417
and an Earthforce vessel
will meet you on the other end.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.042
Most efficient. I commend you.

21:57.125 --> 22:00.333
Is there something else
you wish to say, commander?

22:00.417 --> 22:03.125
Dr. Franklin has confirmed the
potential of your discovery.

22:03.208 --> 22:04.708
But why give it to Earth?

22:04.792 --> 22:08.125
Because it was Earth who turned
the tide against my race.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.875
Thus it is fitting that you
benefit from your conquest.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.833
(Sinclair)
'It was more
an act of preservation.'

22:12.917 --> 22:15.083
You slaughtered mercilessly.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.333
Exterminated whole races.

22:17.417 --> 22:20.625
Committed acts beyond the belief
of all sentient beings.

22:20.708 --> 22:23.333
The Wind Swords said you were
sentimental.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.667
A fatal flaw in a warrior.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.750
You still haven't explained.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.417
Why you want to help
the same people

22:29.500 --> 22:31.667
you butchered 30 years ago?

22:31.750 --> 22:35.250
My race is gone,
their names cursed in history.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.750
Even my Homeworld
no longer exists.

22:37.833 --> 22:40.708
I am the last of the Dilgar.

22:40.792 --> 22:43.417
But my discovery will ensure
that the galaxy

22:43.500 --> 22:45.833
remembers us with honor.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.083
It will be a monument
to our vision.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.208
A monument?
That's what you're after?

22:51.292 --> 22:53.583
Delicious irony,
don't you think?

22:53.667 --> 22:55.458
That those who cursed us

22:55.542 --> 22:58.292
will have to thank us
for the rest of time?

23:01.417 --> 23:03.375
Commander, time to go.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.083
[intense music]

23:35.000 --> 23:40.333
Commander Sinclair, that woman
is the war criminal Jha'dur

23:40.417 --> 23:43.500
known to our worlds as
Deathwalker.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.833
We demand a full assembly
at once.

23:45.917 --> 23:49.667
To discuss her trial on charges
of crimes against sentience.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.708
Ambassador Kalika, I'm sure
Earth Alliance will welcome

23:52.792 --> 23:54.917
all you representatives
to discuss this matter.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.833
However,
Jah'dur is in my custody

23:56.917 --> 23:59.000
and I have orders
to send her to Earth.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.708
Orders I cannot disobey.

24:00.792 --> 24:03.292
You will have
to kill us all first.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.292
Very well,
we'll convene in three hours.

24:15.375 --> 24:18.375
Jha'dur will be held in maximum
security until then.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.292
A fatal flaw indeed.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.583
Mr. Garibaldi, escort this woman
back to her holding quarters

24:30.667 --> 24:33.042
and double the guard on her.

24:38.917 --> 24:40.792
Ambassador, I've thought it over
and I don't believe

24:40.875 --> 24:43.542
that I can continue
with this assignment.

24:43.625 --> 24:48.292
Your belief does not enter
into it. We have a contract.

24:48.375 --> 24:52.000
I know that, but you
don't really need a telepath.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.250
What is need compared
to the path?

24:55.333 --> 24:58.875
[sighs]
The traffic was murder
but here I am.

24:58.958 --> 25:02.500
Miss Winters, so lovely
to see you again.

25:06.042 --> 25:08.583
[dramatic music]

25:13.792 --> 25:16.833
[intense music]

25:18.417 --> 25:19.750
[indistinct chatter]

25:21.708 --> 25:24.042
You know we're sitting
on a fusion bomb here.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.583
At least it's out
in the open now.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.500
Jha'dur will get
the justice she deserves.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.542
Don't be so sure,
the Narns and the Centauri

25:29.625 --> 25:31.000
both collaborated
with the Dilgar

25:31.083 --> 25:32.417
the last thing they want
is a trial.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.083
True, but with my vote
and the Minbari vote

25:35.167 --> 25:36.833
the council will be deadlock
and the league

25:36.917 --> 25:38.417
will have the deciding vote.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.750
- What about Kosh?
- He refuses to participate.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.167
As usual.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.333
What makes you so sure the
Minbari will vote for a trial?

25:44.417 --> 25:45.958
There's no reason
for them not to.

25:46.042 --> 25:48.917
And they're an honorable people.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.500
Listen, Jeff, I got a little hot
before, said some things--

25:52.583 --> 25:54.167
Oh, forget it,
you didn't say anything

25:54.250 --> 25:56.417
I hadn't thought myself.

25:58.583 --> 26:01.833
So I shouldn't listen
to rumors, huh?

26:01.917 --> 26:04.833
Sorry, ambassador, we thought
it best to handle this quietly.

26:04.917 --> 26:07.583
Ah! Great job.

26:11.958 --> 26:14.958
Mr. Lennier, have you spoken
with Ambassador Delenn?

26:15.042 --> 26:18.167
Yes, commander, and I have
been given instructions.

26:21.208 --> 26:25.250
Jeff, all the ambassadors are
here and the chamber's secure.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.583
Good luck.

26:28.292 --> 26:30.875
[indistinct chatter]

26:50.792 --> 26:54.375
This meeting of the Babylon 5
assembly is called to order.

26:54.458 --> 26:57.333
Ambassador Kalika representing
the League of Non-Aligned Worlds

26:57.417 --> 27:00.167
will make
the opening statement.

27:00.250 --> 27:05.208
Thirty years ago, the Dilgar
fell upon our worlds

27:05.292 --> 27:09.250
bringing terror,
slavery and death.

27:09.333 --> 27:12.708
With the help of Earth Alliance
we drove them from our sectors

27:12.792 --> 27:15.667
and brought their leaders
to justice.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.958
All but one.

27:18.042 --> 27:19.917
The worst of the lot.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.625
Deathwalker.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.000
[clamoring]

27:24.500 --> 27:28.417
Now the winds of fate have
delivered her into our hands.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.667
'We of the league
have unanimously decided'

27:30.750 --> 27:33.875
that Jha'dur be tried for her
crimes against sentience.

27:33.958 --> 27:38.208
That trial to be held here on
Babylon 5 as soon as possible.

27:38.292 --> 27:42.958
We now ask that the Advisory
Council approve this decision.

27:43.042 --> 27:44.375
[indistinct chatter]

27:48.625 --> 27:49.958
Ambassador Mollari.

27:52.792 --> 27:58.292
This woman, Deathwalker,
is indeed a great villain.

27:58.375 --> 28:02.292
We Centauri weep for what
she did to your world.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.875
However, because she has
committed no crime

28:06.958 --> 28:11.833
against our republic,
I must reluctantly vote no.

28:11.917 --> 28:12.917
[clamoring]

28:13.000 --> 28:14.333
Treachery!

28:17.042 --> 28:19.792
I'm not surprised the Centauri
are opposed to a trial.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.458
It is well-known the Dilgar
were

28:21.542 --> 28:23.167
merely mercenaries
for their republic.

28:23.250 --> 28:28.250
That is a lie! It was you Narns
who collaborated with this scum.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.958
Centauri propaganda
to hinder our revolution.

28:32.042 --> 28:36.000
That's enough.
Ambassador G'Kar, your vote.

28:37.667 --> 28:41.750
The Narn Regime is noted
for its keen sense of justice.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.625
Therefore, we vote yes.

28:43.708 --> 28:47.000
On one condition, th-that
the trial be held on Narn.

28:47.083 --> 28:50.458
Our neutrality during the
invasion assures fairness.

28:50.542 --> 28:53.458
We are prepared to transport
her there immediately.

28:53.542 --> 28:54.958
[clamoring]

28:55.042 --> 28:57.625
The Narns have no right
to try Jha'dur.

28:57.708 --> 29:00.958
We are well aware of their
involvement with her.

29:01.042 --> 29:03.000
Their proposal is unacceptable.

29:03.083 --> 29:06.708
In that case, the Narn Regime
also votes no.

29:06.792 --> 29:09.375
[indistinct shouting]

29:12.042 --> 29:15.667
Ambassador Kosh has declined to
take part in these proceedings.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.333
On behalf of Earth Alliance,
I vote yes.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.500
Mr. Lennier?

29:27.250 --> 29:31.042
As the Minbari were
not a part of this conflict..

29:31.125 --> 29:34.833
...we have no right
to judge her.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.792
We must therefore..

29:37.875 --> 29:39.167
...vote no.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.792
[clamoring]

29:45.792 --> 29:47.958
Counting the league's single
vote, the decision

29:48.042 --> 29:51.500
is three to two against
a trial with one abstention.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.917
I'm afraid we must find
some other solution.

29:54.042 --> 29:56.042
This is outrageous!

29:56.125 --> 29:59.000
Commander Sinclair,
you have always said

29:59.083 --> 30:01.042
that our worlds
have a voice here.

30:01.125 --> 30:03.250
Will you now deny us this voice?

30:03.333 --> 30:06.042
I'm afraid the rules
of the assembly are very clear.

30:06.125 --> 30:10.417
- But I have a compromise--
- No! No more compromises.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.375
We will no longer
be dictated to

30:12.458 --> 30:16.375
by the very powers who aided
this woman's atrocities!

30:16.458 --> 30:18.458
We withdraw from this assembly.

30:18.542 --> 30:21.042
And rest assured, you have not
heard the last of this!

30:21.125 --> 30:23.667
[all clamoring]

30:24.625 --> 30:25.917
(female #3)
'Justice!'

30:34.667 --> 30:37.167
[sighs]
I am sorry, commander.

30:37.250 --> 30:42.167
I have caused this evil woman
to escape her just fate.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.375
The Wind Swords
did shelter her, didn't they?

30:45.458 --> 30:47.375
And your government
knew about it.

30:47.458 --> 30:50.417
No. Not at first.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.417
When we went to war with Earth

30:52.500 --> 30:54.917
the Wind Swords came
to the council with weapons

30:55.000 --> 30:58.583
terrible weapons
created by this monster.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.417
That's when the council first
learned she was with them.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.667
Of course we couldn't
reveal it then.

31:05.083 --> 31:07.958
And like all secrets long kept

31:08.042 --> 31:11.375
we cannot bear the shame
of admitting it now.

31:20.875 --> 31:23.875
[dramatic music]

31:29.708 --> 31:31.500
Lieutenant Commander,
something is coming

31:31.583 --> 31:33.125
'through the jump gate.'

31:39.542 --> 31:40.792
[zapping]

31:49.250 --> 31:51.292
A Drazi Sun Hawk.
All stations at alert.

31:51.375 --> 31:53.583
Station one, open up com channel
to the Drazi vessel.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.417
Station five, go to hyper track.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.333
I have the Drazi vessel online.

31:59.958 --> 32:03.625
Babylon 5, this is Makar Ashok.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.333
In the name
of the Drazi freehold

32:05.417 --> 32:09.833
I demand immediate extradition
of the war criminal Jha'dur.

32:09.917 --> 32:13.625
Reject this demand
and we will attack immediately.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.167
[intense music]

32:30.042 --> 32:32.000
Drazi vessel
moving into firing range.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.875
[indistinct chatter]

32:33.958 --> 32:35.667
All gun arrays
target Drazi ship.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.125
[machines whirring]

32:40.667 --> 32:43.208
Makar Ashok, our gun arrays
are now fixed on your ship

32:43.292 --> 32:45.375
they will fire the instant
you come into range.

32:45.458 --> 32:48.458
'You'll find their power quite
impressive, for a few seconds.'

32:53.083 --> 32:54.833
(female #4)
'Drazi vessel is slowing.'

32:56.958 --> 32:59.792
Lieutenant Commander, there's
another surge in the vortex.

33:01.458 --> 33:02.750
[zapping]

33:14.417 --> 33:15.625
What's happening?

33:15.708 --> 33:18.042
The Drazi want immediate
extradition of Jha'dur.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.042
I imagine the Iksha and Vree
will make similar demands.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.875
And according to reports,
there are

33:21.958 --> 33:23.375
more league ships on the way.

33:23.458 --> 33:25.500
- Can you stall them?
- I can try, but--

33:25.583 --> 33:26.875
Do it.

33:31.625 --> 33:36.167
[sighs]
Welcome to Babylon 5. I am
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova.

33:36.250 --> 33:38.833
How may we be of assistance?

33:43.917 --> 33:46.208
Ambassador,
call off those ships.

33:46.292 --> 33:49.292
The League and Earth Alliance
have always been friends.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.500
We can settle this matter
diplomatically.

33:51.583 --> 33:56.958
At the moment we do not put much
faith in Babylon 5 diplomacy.

33:57.042 --> 34:00.458
I fear we will soon be severing
our ties with this place.

34:00.542 --> 34:01.750
There's something
you should know

34:01.833 --> 34:03.500
before making that decision.

34:05.083 --> 34:08.125
[intense music]

34:20.917 --> 34:22.625
What's the situation?

34:22.708 --> 34:24.167
Well, I've managed
to get the ship captains

34:24.250 --> 34:27.333
engaged in a debate over who has
the best claim to Jha'dur.

34:27.417 --> 34:28.917
The winner will be
the first to attack.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.125
Creative. Let's hope
that buys us enough time.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.792
Lieutenant Commander,
the League ships

34:33.875 --> 34:35.917
are moving out of firing range.

34:38.042 --> 34:41.042
[intense music]

34:43.708 --> 34:46.583
- What did you do?
- I played a wild card.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.417
But we're not out of this yet.
Stay on alert.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.292
I'll be in closed session
with the league.

34:50.375 --> 34:51.542
Yes, sir.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.833
Good job, lieutenant commander.

35:06.125 --> 35:11.042
A herring is just a herring
but a good cigar is a Cuban.

35:11.125 --> 35:17.042
A stroke of the brush does not
guarantee art from the bristles.

35:17.125 --> 35:20.250
Do you understand, Miss Winters?

35:20.333 --> 35:23.375
[dramatic music]

35:28.583 --> 35:31.125
[bells ringing]

35:51.667 --> 35:52.958
[glass shatters]

35:53.792 --> 35:55.083
[screams]

36:01.542 --> 36:05.292
- Our business is concluded.
- You were swell.

36:05.375 --> 36:09.042
Maybe we can have
that Jovian Sunspot some time.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.833
Kosh, old boy..

36:12.000 --> 36:14.125
...a pleasure as always.

36:23.208 --> 36:25.625
Let's do lunch soon.

36:25.708 --> 36:27.625
Miss Winters.

36:31.125 --> 36:34.833
What is he? And what was on
that data crystal he gave you?

36:36.500 --> 36:41.333
Reflection, surprise, terror.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.125
For the future.

36:48.125 --> 36:50.458
Several of our most
renowned scientists

36:50.542 --> 36:52.625
'have checked
Dr. Franklin's data.'

36:52.708 --> 36:57.167
They concur with his assessment.
A most astounding discovery.

36:57.250 --> 37:00.125
But Deathwalker must still
be punished for her crimes.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.375
I agree and I have a compromise

37:02.458 --> 37:04.125
which may serve all our needs.

37:04.208 --> 37:07.083
Earth is prepared to develop
Jha'dur's discovery immediately.

37:07.167 --> 37:10.542
I propose the League of Worlds
choose a coalition

37:10.625 --> 37:12.375
of scientists to assist her.

37:12.458 --> 37:15.417
When this coalition is satisfied
the serum is ready..

37:15.500 --> 37:18.042
...Jha'dur will be turned
over to the League for trial.

37:20.042 --> 37:21.333
[indistinct whispering]

37:28.792 --> 37:32.625
Can we trust your alliance
will honor this agreement?

37:32.708 --> 37:34.667
And what of the council?

37:34.750 --> 37:36.125
When news of this is made public

37:36.208 --> 37:37.542
Earth Alliance
will have no choice

37:37.625 --> 37:39.958
as for the council,
it's already made its decision.

37:40.042 --> 37:43.167
The agreement is between
Earth and the League.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.958
Just as it was
30 years ago when we

37:45.042 --> 37:47.542
helped you to defeat this woman
and her people.

37:51.958 --> 37:53.375
It is fair.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.458
And wise.

38:01.292 --> 38:04.333
[intense music]

38:09.500 --> 38:12.417
[whooshing]

38:21.583 --> 38:23.458
- It's time.
- Good.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.708
I'm glad Na'Toth didn't succeed.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.667
I'm looking forward
to your trial.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.833
Are you really that naive,
commander?

38:29.917 --> 38:31.375
Do you imagine
Earth Alliance will permit

38:31.458 --> 38:34.083
this charade of yours
to be carried out?

38:34.167 --> 38:36.042
I'll see that they have to.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.083
It will only cost you
your command.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.458
It is the way of things,
Sinclair.

38:42.542 --> 38:45.708
The superior
controls the inferior.

38:45.792 --> 38:49.083
In the final analysis,
we've won.

38:49.167 --> 38:52.292
- I don't think so.
- No?

38:52.375 --> 38:54.708
Then consider this.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.833
You and the rest of your kind
take blind comfort

38:57.917 --> 38:59.875
in the belief
that we are monsters.

38:59.958 --> 39:03.083
That you could never do
what we did.

39:03.167 --> 39:05.583
The key ingredient in the
anti-agapic

39:05.667 --> 39:07.667
cannot be synthesized.

39:07.750 --> 39:10.500
It must be taken
from living beings.

39:10.583 --> 39:14.375
For one to live forever,
another one must die.

39:14.458 --> 39:18.000
You will fall upon
one another like wolves.

39:18.083 --> 39:21.542
It will make what we did
pale by comparison.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.792
The billions who live forever
will be a testimony to my work.

39:24.875 --> 39:26.458
And the billions
who were murdered

39:26.542 --> 39:28.750
to buy that immortality

39:28.833 --> 39:31.375
will be the continuance
of my work.

39:31.458 --> 39:33.250
Not like us?

39:33.333 --> 39:36.125
You will become us.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.792
That's my monument, commander.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.500
Get her the hell off my station.

39:47.083 --> 39:50.417
(female #1)
'Minbari Flyer 969 is now
leaving the docking center.'

40:01.083 --> 40:02.458
Ambassador Kosh?

40:10.167 --> 40:11.875
- Stand by to activate--
- 'Lieutenant Commander.'

40:11.958 --> 40:14.458
Something's coming
through the vortex.

40:16.125 --> 40:19.167
[intense music]

40:20.125 --> 40:22.042
It's a Vorlon ship.

40:23.875 --> 40:27.667
[explosion]

40:30.375 --> 40:33.500
Well, all's well
that ends well, huh?

40:35.250 --> 40:36.458
Why?

40:38.083 --> 40:41.375
You are not ready for
immortality.

40:51.792 --> 40:53.625
Hell of an irony,
don't you think?

40:53.708 --> 40:55.250
We find a reason
to keep Jha'dur alive

40:55.333 --> 40:57.500
and the Vorlons smoke her
for the same reason.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.625
You think it'll always
be like this, Michael?

40:59.708 --> 41:02.000
Little powers at the mercy
of bigger powers.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.583
Politics before morality.

41:03.667 --> 41:05.958
Expediency before justice.

41:06.042 --> 41:09.000
Seems to work for everybody
except you.

41:09.083 --> 41:11.083
Maybe that's why I like you.

41:12.333 --> 41:15.208
Commander, may I speak
to you for a moment?

41:16.792 --> 41:19.750
I think I may be having
a problem with Ambassador Kosh.

41:19.833 --> 41:21.708
- Join the club.
- What's wrong?

41:21.792 --> 41:25.250
[sighs]
Yesterday, Kosh hired me
to mediate on a business deal.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.042
But nothing about it made sense.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.000
They spoke in riddles and I kept

41:29.083 --> 41:30.708
getting these images in my head.

41:30.792 --> 41:32.375
What kind of images?

41:32.458 --> 41:35.250
Well, at first,
just quick flashes, but then..

41:38.125 --> 41:40.500
Four years ago,
I was assigned to scan

41:40.583 --> 41:43.250
a suspect in a murder case
on Mars colony.

41:43.333 --> 41:44.875
He was a serial killer.

41:44.958 --> 41:48.000
I had never been inside a mind
like that before.

41:48.083 --> 41:53.583
His thoughts were brutal,
violent, terrible.

41:53.667 --> 41:56.458
It was the most frightening
experience I ever had.

41:56.542 --> 41:58.750
I still have nightmares
about it.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.708
Today I felt
those same thoughts again.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.208
But this time it was
no nightmare.

42:03.292 --> 42:04.583
It was deliberately provoked.

42:04.667 --> 42:07.542
- Who was Kosh dealing with?
- Another alien.

42:07.625 --> 42:10.542
His said his name was Abbut.

42:10.625 --> 42:13.625
Funny little guy with a big hat?
Drinks Jovian Sunspots?

42:13.708 --> 42:15.542
Yes, that's him.
Do you know him?

42:15.625 --> 42:17.000
He's a Vicker.

42:17.083 --> 42:20.042
It's a slang term
from old Earth tech, a VCR.

42:20.125 --> 42:22.333
They're cyberorganics,
living recorders

42:22.417 --> 42:23.792
part machine, part sentient.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.292
Several of the alien races
use them.

42:25.375 --> 42:26.792
They can record
just about anything.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.833
Sights, sounds, biorhythms,
thought patterns.

42:29.917 --> 42:32.792
- I'd say you were set up.
- But why?

42:32.875 --> 42:35.000
The Vorlons
are leery of telepaths.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.625
If Kosh knows
what you fear the most

42:36.708 --> 42:38.792
he can use it against you
in the future.

42:38.875 --> 42:41.958
- For what?
- With the Vorlons, who knows?

42:45.750 --> 42:48.583
Ambassador Kosh has been
a busy boy today.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.000
They say God works
in mysterious ways.

42:51.083 --> 42:54.292
Maybe so. But he's a con man
compared to the Vorlon.

42:58.875 --> 43:01.917
[dramatic music]

43:07.125 --> 43:08.875
[theme music]
