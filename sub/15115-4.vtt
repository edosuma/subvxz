WEBVTT

00:01.409 --> 00:03.477
Joffrey's School of Ballet
will be coming here

00:03.597 --> 00:05.527
to hold auditions next week

00:05.647 --> 00:07.830
for their summer scholarship program.

00:07.951 --> 00:09.336
I was thinking I was gonna try out.

00:09.456 --> 00:10.735
Well, it certainly can't hurt.

00:10.855 --> 00:12.952
God, Boo, why don't you
just give them a lap dance?

00:13.072 --> 00:15.212
- I could kill Sascha.
- She's so awful.

00:15.332 --> 00:16.219
She's having a bad day.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.575
You have no idea what
it's like to be me, boo.

00:18.695 --> 00:20.938
Don't psychoanalyze me,
feel sorry for me

00:20.973 --> 00:22.248
or defend me.
I'm fine.

00:22.368 --> 00:23.473
Michelle:
<i>This is your home, Fanny.</i>

00:23.612 --> 00:24.745
<i>You are going to live here,</i>

00:24.780 --> 00:27.163
<i>and I'm going to move</i>
<i>into the guesthouse.</i>

00:27.849 --> 00:30.451
It is not possible that all
of this stuff is mine.

00:30.485 --> 00:31.485
It's a physical impossibility.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.485
I'm pretty sure it's all yours.

00:32.521 --> 00:33.788
A-ha!
"Pretty sure."

00:33.822 --> 00:36.490
- That's not absolutely sure...
- I'm pretty absolutely sure.

00:36.525 --> 00:38.459
- It's all on the manifest.
- Whoa there, partner.

00:38.493 --> 00:40.394
- Where you going with that?
- <i>He's just taking it inside.</i>

00:40.429 --> 00:43.564
What? No. I don't have enough
inside for all of this to go in.

00:43.599 --> 00:45.466
I mean how many
more boxes are there?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.467
These are all the boxes.

00:46.501 --> 00:47.501
What's left is just furniture.

00:47.536 --> 00:48.669
Furniture?
Oh my God.

00:48.704 --> 00:49.804
That stupid landlord.

00:49.838 --> 00:50.838
You want a little backstory?

00:50.872 --> 00:51.872
To tell you the truth,
I really don't--

00:51.907 --> 00:53.774
See, I had to leave
Vegas in a hurry.

00:53.809 --> 00:55.576
I wasn't running from
the law or anything.

00:55.611 --> 00:56.644
I just bolted really quickly

00:56.678 --> 00:57.878
and left all my stuff
in my apartment,

00:57.913 --> 00:59.714
so I made a deal with the
landlord to ship it.

00:59.748 --> 01:02.550
Only he threw in stuff that
isn't even mine for sure.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.785
I mean this? Does this look
like something I would own?

01:04.819 --> 01:06.787
Me? Actually,
this is mine.

01:06.822 --> 01:08.623
I have a crazy aunt who
has a thing for Mexico.

01:08.657 --> 01:10.658
But the bulk of this
stuff-- no way!

01:10.692 --> 01:12.360
Comin' through.
Watch your backs.

01:12.394 --> 01:13.794
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

01:13.829 --> 01:15.796
The buffet?
Are you joking?

01:15.831 --> 01:18.566
- It's on the manifest.
- But this is one of the old pieces

01:18.600 --> 01:20.735
of crap furniture that was
in the place when I took it.

01:20.769 --> 01:22.637
I never even touched it
after that first day

01:22.671 --> 01:23.771
when I opened this drawer,
and there was this

01:23.805 --> 01:24.839
thing in it.
( Small gasp )

01:24.873 --> 01:26.507
The thing's
still there. Wow.

01:26.541 --> 01:28.442
- I'm not taking this!
- <i>We have to leave it.</i>

01:28.477 --> 01:29.644
- It's on the--
- It's on the manifest.

01:29.678 --> 01:31.479
- I know.
- ( Clock bell tolls )

01:31.513 --> 01:32.813
Oh.

01:32.848 --> 01:34.715
Well. Hello there, grandpa.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.550
Nice to see you.

01:36.585 --> 01:39.286
I need these
dirt patches filled in.

01:39.321 --> 01:40.688
I know there's not
enough sun to ain it.

01:40.722 --> 01:42.690
But just to get me
through the auditions.

01:42.724 --> 01:45.760
And I want to plant flowers
along the base of the studio

01:45.794 --> 01:47.628
and all around the back.

01:47.663 --> 01:49.664
Color!
Think color.

01:51.566 --> 01:53.300
What's going on here?

01:53.335 --> 01:55.469
- I'm being robbed in reverse.
- What?

01:55.504 --> 01:58.305
Things are being brought to
me that I do not own or want.

01:58.340 --> 01:59.674
Do not say what
you're about to say.

01:59.708 --> 02:00.675
Follow me.

02:01.677 --> 02:03.244
Follow me!

02:03.278 --> 02:04.612
Oh, me? Okay.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.385
Every <i>barre</i> is loose,
so tighten them.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.653
Now the audio.

02:12.688 --> 02:14.622
The left speaker on the stereo

02:14.656 --> 02:17.458
is still staticky even after
you fixed it the last time,

02:17.492 --> 02:19.393
so please look at it again.

02:19.428 --> 02:20.594
The new mirror is over there.

02:20.629 --> 02:21.662
Please put that up first,

02:21.697 --> 02:23.297
so that I know
that it's perfect.

02:23.331 --> 02:25.399
And get all that
stuff out of there.

02:25.434 --> 02:26.634
- Did you hear me?
- Hear what?

02:26.668 --> 02:28.402
Get all of that stuff
in the driveway

02:28.437 --> 02:30.304
- out of there.
- Sorry, you're cues today

02:30.338 --> 02:31.639
on who you're talking to
are a little vague.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.340
Now, the thing about
the stuff--

02:33.375 --> 02:34.375
is that it's all
going bye-bye.

02:34.409 --> 02:35.676
- Yes, but--
- No buts.

02:35.711 --> 02:37.378
I'm trying to deal with it, Fanny.
It's just more

02:37.412 --> 02:39.280
than I thought there
was going to be.

02:39.314 --> 02:41.549
I mean I didn't want any of that
furniture shipped. It's junk!

02:41.583 --> 02:43.350
- Was it on the manifest?
- ( Angrily ) Yes.

02:43.385 --> 02:44.652
( Whines )
But it's not even mine.

02:44.686 --> 02:47.555
I mean I took this place in
Vegas partially furnished

02:47.589 --> 02:49.323
because at the time
I was coming off

02:49.357 --> 02:50.624
of a partially
unhappy relationship

02:50.659 --> 02:51.659
with this guy
that I lived with--

02:51.693 --> 02:53.427
more unhappy than partial.

02:53.462 --> 02:55.429
And I thought, "great!
Less stuff to buy."

02:55.464 --> 02:57.465
But, oh my God, the stuff
in this apartment--

02:57.499 --> 02:59.734
I mean the grandfather clock
actually has a cutout in the back,

02:59.768 --> 03:02.203
like clemenza used it
to stash a gun for Michael

03:02.237 --> 03:03.370
to shoot the police chief with.

03:04.372 --> 03:05.372
Wait.

03:05.407 --> 03:06.474
Who killed a police chief?

03:06.508 --> 03:07.508
Michael in
"the godfather."

03:07.542 --> 03:08.509
Oh my God.

03:08.543 --> 03:09.510
How long did I tune you out

03:09.544 --> 03:10.578
that you went
all the way there?

03:10.612 --> 03:12.480
So I'm just saying
all of that stuff

03:12.514 --> 03:13.647
- will be gone--
- Immediately.

03:13.682 --> 03:15.549
- If not immediately--
- Then immediately.

03:15.584 --> 03:18.219
So if there's any extra
storage nooks or crannies

03:18.253 --> 03:20.287
that I could temporarily
put some of this stuff in,

03:20.322 --> 03:21.455
- that would be--
- No.

03:21.490 --> 03:23.457
There are no nooks,
there are no crannies--

03:23.492 --> 03:24.658
not with
the joffrey people coming.

03:24.693 --> 03:27.428
I don't want them
accidently opening a door

03:27.462 --> 03:29.230
and the end table
from "blue velvet"

03:29.264 --> 03:30.297
lands on their heads.

03:30.332 --> 03:31.532
( Whining )
But it's so much stuff.

03:31.566 --> 03:34.535
Make it disappear.
Like David Copperfield.

03:34.569 --> 03:35.636
That's a Vegas reference.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.304
You know how David Copperfield

03:37.339 --> 03:38.405
makes stuff disappear?

03:39.441 --> 03:40.608
Actually, I don't.

03:40.642 --> 03:43.344
David Copperfield is
a very professional magician

03:43.378 --> 03:46.514
who honors the value of keeping the
mystery of the magical arts alive.

03:50.685 --> 03:53.320
I'm feeling very fatalistic
about all this.

03:53.355 --> 03:55.589
- Is there any more?
- Not much more.

03:55.624 --> 03:57.691
Do me a solid and make
like David Copperfield.

03:57.726 --> 03:59.360
- The magician?
- Yeah.

03:59.394 --> 04:00.327
I'm sorry.

04:00.362 --> 04:02.196
( Sighs ) I didn't think so.

04:10.305 --> 04:12.406
<i>( Theme music playing )</i>

04:14.000 --> 04:20.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:36.231 --> 04:38.499
( Gasps ) Garlic hummus

04:38.533 --> 04:39.667
with the super
crunchy pita chips.

04:39.701 --> 04:41.202
We should get that.

04:41.236 --> 04:42.570
- Nope.
- Just the pita chips?

04:42.604 --> 04:44.371
Put the bag down, mom.

04:45.373 --> 04:46.373
Thanks.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.577
- Here.
- They look so crunchy.

04:49.611 --> 04:51.412
Let's go find some radishes.

04:51.446 --> 04:52.546
That sounds fun.

04:52.581 --> 04:54.548
I do like my fancy
shopping bag.

04:54.583 --> 04:57.318
We are so global bringing our chemist
totes like this.

04:57.352 --> 04:59.320
I only had to bug you
for a year to get you to do it.

04:59.354 --> 05:00.554
It was the picture
of that seagull choking

05:00.589 --> 05:02.289
on that plastic bag
that did it.

05:02.324 --> 05:03.390
Made me cry.

05:03.425 --> 05:04.625
And now this makes me happy.

05:04.659 --> 05:06.560
Like that seagull
choked for a reason.

05:06.595 --> 05:09.396
- Look how colorful!
- ( Sighs ) Boo!

05:09.431 --> 05:11.232
Ah, this stuff's beautiful.

05:11.266 --> 05:13.467
- Boring!
- We'll get 2 bundles of the radishes.

05:13.501 --> 05:15.569
We already have
turnips, celery.

05:15.604 --> 05:16.637
I'm just trying to be good.

05:16.671 --> 05:19.306
The joffrey auditions
are in one week.

05:19.341 --> 05:21.475
Now is <i>crunch</i> time.

05:21.509 --> 05:23.410
Get it?
<i>Crun</i> time.

05:23.445 --> 05:24.545
( Chuckles )
A thing as having

05:24.579 --> 05:25.646
too much of a good thing.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.314
Let's get something fun.

05:27.349 --> 05:29.216
I did.
I got edamame.

05:29.251 --> 05:31.318
( Sarcastically )
Hooray for edamame!

05:31.353 --> 05:33.220
( Gasps ) Look!

05:33.255 --> 05:34.421
The homemade peanut butter cups

05:34.456 --> 05:35.656
from the hippie place
in topanga canyon.

05:35.690 --> 05:37.291
It's a miracle they have these.

05:37.325 --> 05:38.659
They're usually all off
on their naked retreat

05:38.693 --> 05:40.427
- this time of year.
- No.

05:40.462 --> 05:41.528
- Come on.
- No.

05:41.563 --> 05:43.530
- Get them for me then.
- I'm not stopping you.

05:43.565 --> 05:45.633
It's more fun when
we eat stuff together.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.202
- Mom.
- I just--

05:48.236 --> 05:50.537
I worry a little bit.
I mean this joffrey audition

05:50.572 --> 05:53.340
- seems so important.
- It is so important.

05:53.375 --> 05:54.575
You were so disappointed
last year

05:54.609 --> 05:56.277
when you didn't
get in, remember?

05:56.311 --> 05:57.344
Yeah, I remember.

05:57.379 --> 05:58.445
You cried all week long,

05:58.480 --> 05:59.613
I got you that
cake to cheer you up

05:59.648 --> 06:01.482
and we ate the whole thing,
every bit of it.

06:01.516 --> 06:03.183
That was a good cake.

06:03.218 --> 06:04.351
( Exhales ) So good.

06:04.386 --> 06:06.520
But this year's different.
I'm better.

06:06.554 --> 06:09.256
I'm a better dancer,
I'm in better shape--

06:09.291 --> 06:11.158
You are in perfect shape.

06:11.192 --> 06:12.426
You are perfect.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.395
I'm ready.
I know I'm ready.

06:14.429 --> 06:16.530
Okay, but if it
doesn't work out--

06:16.564 --> 06:18.532
It <i>will</i>, you'll see.

06:18.566 --> 06:20.367
Okay. Just checking.

06:20.402 --> 06:22.569
Kettle corn!

06:22.604 --> 06:25.339
Ah, keep moving.
Keep moving

06:25.373 --> 06:27.174
popcorn's a whole grain.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.575
The Southern lady
on the food channel

06:28.610 --> 06:31.211
- said so.
- ( Gasps ) Ooh, kale.

Hot.
Is that hot?

06:53.435 --> 06:54.501
Ooh, that's hot.

- Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay.

07:24.199 --> 07:26.300
Okay. Help!
Help! Anybody!

07:26.334 --> 07:29.269
Anybody? Anyone who knows
anything about gas?

07:42.450 --> 07:43.484
- ( Thuds )
- Ow!

07:43.518 --> 07:45.252
Ah!

07:45.286 --> 07:46.520
It's like a storage
facility in here.

07:46.554 --> 07:49.256
- Fanny?
- Why are your doors open?

07:49.290 --> 07:50.591
- Why are you here?
- And why is your window open?

07:50.625 --> 07:52.493
- Is everything okay?
- Aren't you freezing?

07:52.527 --> 07:54.328
- It's freezing in here.
- That's what I just said.

07:54.362 --> 07:56.163
- Are the windows open?
- And the door.

07:56.197 --> 07:57.264
I left the door open?

07:57.298 --> 07:58.265
We have got to get out of this

07:58.299 --> 07:59.433
mobius strip of conversation

07:59.467 --> 08:01.301
- or I'll scream.
- Oh, get used to it.

08:01.336 --> 08:03.303
- I'm slow to awaken.
- We don't sleep together.

08:03.338 --> 08:04.438
Why should I get used to it?

08:05.473 --> 08:07.541
- Bright!
- Well, I have to see.

08:07.575 --> 08:09.543
Everything was open
'cause the place

08:09.577 --> 08:11.378
filled up with gas
from the stove.

08:11.413 --> 08:14.214
I had to air it out or die.

08:14.249 --> 08:15.549
We got it off eventually.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.117
We?
Who's we?

08:17.152 --> 08:18.452
Me and your guy.

08:18.486 --> 08:21.121
- What guy?
- Oh, the guy with the beard.

08:21.156 --> 08:23.257
He was outside and asked
if I needed help.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.258
So he helped.

08:24.292 --> 08:25.392
I don't have a guy.

08:25.427 --> 08:26.427
Then who the hell was that?

08:26.461 --> 08:28.295
I don't know.
Maybe a stalker

08:28.329 --> 08:30.264
or Charlie manson's kid brher.

08:30.298 --> 08:32.433
I thought he was your guy.

08:32.467 --> 08:35.436
Boy, the beard made
him seem so kind,

08:35.470 --> 08:36.437
like Lincoln.

08:36.471 --> 08:38.105
This place is a mess.

08:38.139 --> 08:39.273
<i>It's 'cause I have</i>
<i>too much stuff,</i>

08:39.307 --> 08:40.541
<i>and too little place.</i>

08:40.575 --> 08:43.210
When joffrey is here
it cannot be this way.

08:43.244 --> 08:44.478
I'll be a laughingstock.

08:44.512 --> 08:47.147
I have no kitchen.
I've just discovered that.

08:47.182 --> 08:49.149
The fridge is hot,
the stove is busted

08:49.184 --> 08:51.151
<i>and I can't open three</i>
<i>of the cupboard doors.</i>

08:51.186 --> 08:53.153
This hasn't been
a working kitchen for years.

08:53.188 --> 08:54.521
Well, can I borrow
your kitchen?

08:54.556 --> 08:56.423
Why not? I mean,
technically it's yours.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.193
No. It's yours.
I'd just be borrowing it.

08:59.227 --> 09:01.228
Be my guest. Just
don't come too early.

09:01.262 --> 09:02.463
- Or I'll wake you up?
- Yes.

09:02.497 --> 09:03.530
That would be rude.

09:03.565 --> 09:05.065
Did you pack this?

09:05.100 --> 09:06.433
No, my dirty little
landlord did.

09:06.468 --> 09:08.435
Well he has no respect
for possessions.

09:08.470 --> 09:10.270
But he alphabetized my cds.

09:10.305 --> 09:11.371
That's weird, right?

09:11.406 --> 09:13.307
That sounds weird.

09:13.341 --> 09:16.477
I wouldn't wear any of this
underwear until you wash it.

09:16.511 --> 09:17.544
Do you have hangers?

09:17.579 --> 09:19.179
In the armoire.

09:20.181 --> 09:22.149
You're very peppy Miller.

09:22.183 --> 09:23.484
I don't sleep much.

09:23.518 --> 09:26.153
But sleep is sublime!

09:26.187 --> 09:28.489
Oh, I sleep, but I only
need two or three hours.

09:28.523 --> 09:30.124
And the middle of the night

09:30.158 --> 09:32.159
is the perfect time
to get things done,

09:32.193 --> 09:36.196
- when all the noises of the day have dissipated.
- Fanny, don't do that.

09:36.231 --> 09:38.432
- I don't mind.
- No. I don't mean you don't have to do that.

09:38.466 --> 09:39.466
I mean, don't do that.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.201
But if you don't unpack,
all your stuff

09:41.236 --> 09:42.536
will smell like box.

09:42.570 --> 09:44.404
Do you hang sweaters
or fold them?

09:44.439 --> 09:45.439
Fold.

09:46.541 --> 09:49.243
This reminds me of when
I first left home

09:49.277 --> 09:50.577
to study dance out of town.

09:50.579 --> 09:52.379
I was only 16.

09:52.413 --> 09:55.549
My God. Can you imagine?
16 and out of the house.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.385
The week before I left,
my mother gave me this book,

09:58.419 --> 10:00.387
"how a young lady
should do things."

10:00.421 --> 10:02.489
It was this ancient
little tiny leathery thing.

10:02.524 --> 10:04.324
Sounds like my Vegas landlord.

10:04.359 --> 10:07.327
I read it cover to cover. A lot
of it was corny and out-of-date.

10:07.362 --> 10:11.098
I mean there was a chapter on how
to look ladylike in a rumble seat.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.499
But it was charming too.

10:12.534 --> 10:15.269
I learned housekeeping,
etiquette,

10:15.303 --> 10:17.137
the best packing rules.

10:18.473 --> 10:20.107
You have three tiaras.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.275
Mm-hmm.

10:21.309 --> 10:24.211
Why would anyone need
one cheap party store tiara,

10:24.245 --> 10:26.380
- let alone three?
- It is so too much the middle of the night

10:26.414 --> 10:28.282
to be sussing something
like this out.

10:28.316 --> 10:30.150
This one still has
a price tag on it.

10:30.185 --> 10:31.552
Good.
I can return it.

10:31.586 --> 10:34.188
I will say it's nice to
have someone to talk to.

10:34.222 --> 10:35.289
It's so quiet around here

10:35.323 --> 10:37.224
- in the middle of the night.
- Mmm.

10:37.258 --> 10:39.159
Someone to talk to.

11:06.526 --> 11:07.526
<i>( Music stops )</i>

11:19.305 --> 11:21.306
<i>( Music continues )</i>

11:33.370 --> 11:35.354
There's room at the <i>barre.</i>

11:36.062 --> 11:37.062
I'm good.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.699
See the dancing show
last night?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.701
Yup.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.036
I don't know who
half the people are--

11:44.070 --> 11:45.971
A bunch of
washed-up alcoholics.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.740
Mm-hmm.

11:48.654 --> 11:50.743
And we saw Michelle
in her underwear.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.777
( Flatly ) Wow.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.980
Sorry to bother you.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.720
Simple sandwiches--
nice variety

12:01.755 --> 12:02.721
and small.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.657
These are for ballerinas
and their moms.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.691
No dagwoods.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.561
You're grimacing.
Why are you grimacing?

12:08.595 --> 12:09.962
- You know what weird?
- What?

12:09.996 --> 12:12.798
I get hungover after
nights I don't drink.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.735
- That is weird. - I mean I got Jon Bonham
banging around up there.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.571
I haven't had a drink
since Thursday.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.638
Maybe it's a sugar thing.

12:19.673 --> 12:20.639
Did you eat too much sugar?

12:20.674 --> 12:21.807
I don't eat sugar.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.909
Wait.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.911
I did drink last night.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.781
- Good grief.
- And I had a candy bar.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.016
- So it was a combo.
- Could I get both of you

12:31.051 --> 12:32.818
to focus please?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.820
- Sorry, Fanny.
- Yeah, I'm cool. Let's do this.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.557
So on the sandwiches-- keep
the crusts, lose the crusts?

12:38.592 --> 12:40.726
- Lose them. It's classier,
- Wait wait wait. I'm not cutting the crusts

12:40.760 --> 12:42.995
off of anything, not again.
I cut my finger last time.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.030
So have someone else
cut off the crusts.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.732
Crusts are the best part.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.900
Why would you
cut off the crusts?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.602
I like crusts too.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.837
Rico, if you're not willing
to do what I need you to do,

12:51.872 --> 12:53.639
I will take my business
elsewhere.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.774
I'm cool with that.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.010
Fine!
Keep the crusts.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.747
Now, the salads. I need you
to dress them lightly.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.983
Last year it was as if
you waterboarded them.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.552
( Laughs )

13:06.586 --> 13:07.686
What's so funny?

13:07.721 --> 13:10.522
"Waterboarded the salads," man.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.625
- That's sick.
- "Don't waterboard the salads."

13:12.659 --> 13:13.692
- Got it, Fanny.
- <i>Good.</i>

13:13.727 --> 13:16.595
Now. On to
the welcome refreshments.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.897
Those weren't
the welcome refreshments?

13:17.931 --> 13:18.998
Yeah. I thought
those were

13:19.032 --> 13:20.666
the welcome refreshments.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.668
No, guys. Those were
the afternoon snacks.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.969
Aren't you listening?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.705
- I'm trying.
- How much are these people gonna eat?

13:26.740 --> 13:29.642
Rico! How are you ever
gonna make it as a caterer

13:29.676 --> 13:30.809
with that sort of attitude?

13:30.844 --> 13:32.811
I'm not trying to
make it as a caterer.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.813
I'm just gonna make
you some sandwiches.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.882
( Sighs ) Oh drag!

13:36.917 --> 13:39.985
- We're still open.
- Aw, I'm dealing with Fanny here.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.855
Nina, we're catering
that thing again.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.925
- You're not a caterer.
- I told her I'm not a caterer.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.660
- He's not a caterer.
- ( Mouths )

13:47.694 --> 13:49.561
We're just trying to bank
some extra scratch,

13:49.596 --> 13:52.564
so we don't have to stay
open seven days a week.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.834
We're open seven days a week?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.736
Who made that decision?

13:57.771 --> 14:00.706
I don't know.
One of us at some point.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.975
- ( Softly ) It's stupid.
- I know!

14:03.009 --> 14:06.545
( Cellphone ringing )

14:06.579 --> 14:08.647
Of course!
Lisa from the Joffrey.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.715
Now what?

14:09.749 --> 14:10.983
Hello?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.751
Yes, hello, Lisa.
What's up?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.823
I see.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.591
Okay, uh--

14:19.626 --> 14:22.962
Well, I can be back at the
house in, oh, 10 minutes.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.964
I'll read it
and I'll call you back.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.966
Thanks for the heads up.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.734
Yeah. Bye now.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.802
I have to go home.

14:29.836 --> 14:30.970
Bad news?
What'd she say?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.738
She didn't. She just
said they're sending

14:32.772 --> 14:33.806
a fax.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.575
And that's a bad thing?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.810
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
<i>- I guess that's a bad thing.</i>

14:37.844 --> 14:39.912
Hey! Try to find
out how hungry

14:39.946 --> 14:41.747
they all think
they're gonna be!

14:41.781 --> 14:43.849
<i>( Door closes )</i>
<i>Fanny: Five days!</i>

14:43.883 --> 14:45.751
- Five days notice?
- Five days.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.820
Five days. What am I
supposed to do in five days?

14:47.854 --> 14:48.988
- I don't know. It's horrible.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

14:49.022 --> 14:50.556
It's horrible and insulting,

14:50.590 --> 14:51.657
<i>because this was on purpose.</i>

14:51.691 --> 14:53.559
- Hey, Fanny, can I--
- Shh-shh-shh-shh!

14:53.593 --> 14:55.561
Okay?
What's happening?

14:55.595 --> 14:57.730
( Emphatically ) Joffrey sent

14:57.764 --> 15:00.532
- a fax.
- Wow.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.534
There's still fax machines?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.603
Fanny, I know that this
isn't the best time,

15:04.637 --> 15:05.871
but it's kind
of important. Sorry.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.873
- What?
- Is my toilet on a timer?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.908
- What?
- Well it only seems to work

15:09.943 --> 15:11.577
at certain times of the day.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.911
Like right now
it's 11:30,

15:12.946 --> 15:13.946
and it conked out again.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.547
It did the same thing yesterday

15:15.582 --> 15:16.949
at the exact
same time-- 11:30.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.851
This is the worst
possible moment

15:18.885 --> 15:20.519
to be talking about
your toilet.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.720
Well, there's never
really a good time

15:21.755 --> 15:24.523
to discuss a toilet,
in my experience.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.591
What's wrong, Fanny?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.627
The Joffrey has sent a fax.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.530
The fax being their bomb-dropping
vehicle of choice.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.799
- What's it say?
- They're cancelling the auditions.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.734
Oh-- oh my God!
Those poor girls.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.969
They've been
preparing for weeks.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.871
Are they just doing away
with the summer program?

15:38.905 --> 15:40.606
No, they're still
holding the auditions,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.508
but they're holding
them somewhere else.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.976
Oh wow--
Short notice! Why?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.978
Read for yourself.

15:46.012 --> 15:48.647
"Dear Fanny, once again,
it's been a pleasure working

15:48.681 --> 15:51.550
with you on the 2012 Joffrey
summer program auditions

15:51.584 --> 15:53.786
for Southern California, and we
hope this letter finds you well.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.522
We were wondering
if you could provide an update on the state

15:56.556 --> 15:57.823
of the wood floor
in the dance studio.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.725
It's our last piece
of outstanding business.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.894
In advance, we thank you."
Et cetera, et cetera.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.829
I'm confused.
What's the problem?

16:03.863 --> 16:06.498
- What's the problem?
- What's the problem?

16:06.533 --> 16:08.500
- They just lopped my head off...
- "Game of thrones."

16:08.535 --> 16:09.868
- ...with no warning.
- Ned-Starked her.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.738
I'm re-reading. I see nothing
about a head, a guillotine,

16:12.772 --> 16:14.540
an evil boy king
with mommy issues.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.541
I'm behind here.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.909
They've cancelled on me.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.478
It says nothing
about cancellation!

16:19.512 --> 16:20.612
Well, you don't speak Joffrey.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.780
That's what it says!

16:21.815 --> 16:24.516
I disagree. Truly,
be the tiebreaker here.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.752
Oh, no. I'm no good
at breaking ties.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.720
I'm good at being
in the majority

16:28.755 --> 16:30.722
after the majority
has already voted,

16:30.757 --> 16:32.724
so I can see which way
things are gonna go.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.494
That's... my thing.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.729
12 years I've hosted
these auditions,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.898
only to be jettisoned
like a used tire.

16:39.933 --> 16:40.899
Did I deserve this?

16:40.934 --> 16:42.534
- No!
- I don't know. I mean no.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.671
Of course not.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.708
Hey, do you do curtains?

16:51.544 --> 16:52.811
<i>( Door shuts )</i>

17:01.921 --> 17:03.922
<i>( Acoustic guitar</i>
<i>music playing )</i>

17:40.883 --> 17:41.916
All right, let's see.

17:41.950 --> 17:44.919
French, German, Asian language,

17:44.953 --> 17:47.755
Chinese, Spanish.
Where's English?

17:47.789 --> 17:48.890
English.

17:50.893 --> 17:52.894
<i>( Acoustic guitar music playing )</i>
<i>All right.</i>

18:04.039 --> 18:05.206
Come on.

18:22.224 --> 18:24.091
( Sighs )

18:26.028 --> 18:27.161
( Sighs )

18:27.195 --> 18:29.130
You're better than this.

18:29.164 --> 18:31.832
There is no English!
There is no English!

18:32.868 --> 18:33.868
( Groans )

18:38.974 --> 18:40.942
- ( Sighs )
- ( Clatters )

18:42.844 --> 18:46.047
Fanny: <i>I hate that you're giving
me the runaround like this.</i>

18:46.081 --> 18:47.982
<i>Because I'm getting</i>
<i>the runaround.</i>

18:48.016 --> 18:50.985
<i>That's why I'm complaining</i>
<i>about getting the runaround.</i>

18:51.019 --> 18:53.054
<i>Now, sweetie, saying you don't
mean to be giving me the runaround</i>

18:53.088 --> 18:54.989
doesn't mean
it's not happening.

18:55.023 --> 18:57.224
You sound young.
How young are you?

18:57.259 --> 18:58.993
19?

18:59.027 --> 19:00.962
And you're Lisa's assistant?

19:00.996 --> 19:02.697
You're not Lisa's assistant.

19:02.731 --> 19:04.799
Then who are you?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.033
I'm talking to an intern.

19:06.068 --> 19:08.703
Why didn't you tell me
you were an intern?

19:08.737 --> 19:10.972
No, identifying yourself
is part of your job,

19:11.006 --> 19:14.775
along with sharpening pencils
and fetching frappuccinos.

19:14.810 --> 19:17.044
Now have someone who's at
least two notches above you

19:17.079 --> 19:19.947
and born in the last century,
call me back quickly.

19:19.982 --> 19:21.148
Please. Goodbye.

19:22.284 --> 19:24.919
- Sounds tense.
- What do you need?

19:24.953 --> 19:26.988
I just wanted to sneak
in and grab the toolbox.

19:27.022 --> 19:28.222
I'm having a little
curtain rod trouble.

19:28.256 --> 19:30.157
It's where it always is.

19:30.192 --> 19:32.159
Oh. By the way,
I think I figured out

19:32.194 --> 19:33.995
why Sylvia Plath
killed herself.

19:34.029 --> 19:35.997
She was trying
to hang a curtain rod.

19:36.031 --> 19:37.932
She probably tried to hang
herself on the curtain rod,

19:37.966 --> 19:39.300
but it broke,
so it was on to plan B.

19:40.969 --> 19:43.037
So, really bad call?

19:43.071 --> 19:45.139
It's over. Joffrey's
moving the auditions.

19:45.173 --> 19:46.807
You're kidding?
Where?

19:46.842 --> 19:48.976
- Ojai.
- Ohio? Really?

19:49.011 --> 19:50.978
Not Ohio--
Ojai.

19:51.013 --> 19:53.981
It's that slum
30 miles north of here.

19:54.016 --> 19:56.984
You can all go. We've
done enough for today.

19:57.019 --> 19:59.153
But we never even started.

19:59.187 --> 20:00.821
Go!

20:02.090 --> 20:04.158
It's the kidnapping
capital of California.

20:04.192 --> 20:05.826
- What is?
- Ojai.

20:05.861 --> 20:06.994
They mistreat animals too.

20:07.029 --> 20:10.031
Oh, that Kelly Breen.
That evil Kelly Breen.

20:10.065 --> 20:12.967
- Joffrey lady?
- Owns the dance studio in Ojai.

20:13.001 --> 20:14.969
She's been lobbying
for this every year,

20:15.003 --> 20:16.804
and she finally got her way.

20:16.838 --> 20:18.806
She almost got it last year,
but then that flood hit them

20:18.840 --> 20:20.241
and all those people died,
and so she lost out.

20:20.275 --> 20:21.909
Close call.

20:21.943 --> 20:23.844
It was a close call.

20:23.879 --> 20:26.080
So wait? Ojai.

20:26.114 --> 20:27.248
You know, now that
I think about it,

20:27.282 --> 20:29.183
I've heard really good
things about that place.

20:29.217 --> 20:32.019
Impossible. It's dirty and
all the people are high

20:32.054 --> 20:33.821
on mushrooms and wear sandals.

20:33.855 --> 20:35.823
No, on TV. I saw this
whole thing about it

20:35.857 --> 20:37.091
on "Samantha brown."

20:37.125 --> 20:39.093
Oh, she was walking
around this great spa.

20:39.127 --> 20:42.830
Getting seaweed wraps, playing
golf on this gorgeous course.

20:42.864 --> 20:45.099
And at pink hour, they served
a giant platter of shrimp.

20:45.133 --> 20:46.867
I don't know who
this Samantha brown is,

20:46.902 --> 20:47.902
but she sounds like an idiot.

20:47.936 --> 20:49.070
No no no,
she's this ex-actress

20:49.104 --> 20:50.905
and now she has
this travel show

20:50.939 --> 20:52.073
and she gets to go
to fun places.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.008
Well, she's obviously
a very good actress

20:54.042 --> 20:55.242
if she made you believe
she liked Ojai,

20:55.277 --> 20:56.944
because Ojai is a pit!

20:56.978 --> 20:58.179
No, she doesn't act
on her show,

20:58.213 --> 20:59.980
it's just her
walking around places.

21:00.015 --> 21:02.083
I don't want to talk
about this woman anymore.

21:02.117 --> 21:03.818
Or Ojai.

21:03.852 --> 21:05.252
I think I'm missing
something here.

21:05.287 --> 21:07.088
The girls still get
to audition, right?

21:07.122 --> 21:08.889
Ojai's not that far.

21:08.924 --> 21:10.057
Of course they can audition.

21:10.092 --> 21:12.059
I won't be there,
but they can be.

21:12.094 --> 21:15.963
They why? Why is it so important
that they're held <i>here?</i>

21:15.997 --> 21:17.131
It's so much work.

21:17.165 --> 21:19.133
You really don't
get it, do you?

21:19.167 --> 21:21.068
But I do.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.236
All right, the floor
is a little funky.

21:22.270 --> 21:24.805
There's loose boards,
it needs a sanding,

21:24.840 --> 21:26.140
and they want it fixed.
So if you want

21:26.174 --> 21:27.975
the auditions here
so damn much,

21:28.009 --> 21:29.143
fix the damn floors.

21:29.177 --> 21:30.978
Oh.

21:31.012 --> 21:32.980
Fix it!

21:33.014 --> 21:34.982
Why didn't I think of that?

21:35.016 --> 21:36.817
Fix the floor.

21:36.852 --> 21:38.219
Pay the money to get someone

21:38.253 --> 21:40.154
to come in and fix the floor.

21:40.188 --> 21:42.156
- Yes.
- Okay!

21:42.190 --> 21:45.159
Well, I'll just go
out back to the barn

21:45.193 --> 21:47.061
and get my goose
that lays the golden eggs

21:47.095 --> 21:49.063
and I'll squeeze one of those
little suckers out of her--

21:49.097 --> 21:50.965
One should do it.
Or wait,

21:50.999 --> 21:52.166
how about this?

21:52.200 --> 21:55.002
I'll wait for the magical
rainbow that will lead me

21:55.036 --> 21:56.804
<i>to where the sprightly elf</i>

21:56.838 --> 21:57.972
has hidden the pot of gold.

21:58.006 --> 22:00.007
And I'll grab those gold coins

22:00.041 --> 22:01.842
and whatever
other treasure he has--

22:01.877 --> 22:03.778
maybe a crown
or some ingots--

22:03.812 --> 22:05.780
and then I'll have
the money to fix the floor.

22:05.814 --> 22:08.182
I'm picking up
a wee bit of snark here,

22:08.216 --> 22:09.917
so I'm going to take my toolbox

22:09.951 --> 22:11.852
and leave you to spiral
down the rabbit hole

22:11.887 --> 22:13.788
you've jumped into.
Send a postcard!

22:22.610 --> 22:25.417
Great. Perfect.

22:25.977 --> 22:28.245
Your timing is perfect!

22:28.280 --> 22:30.981
- Geez.
- My point shoes are broken.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.817
Broken.
There's no way

22:32.851 --> 22:34.443
I'm getting through
the Joffrey auditions.

22:34.563 --> 22:36.263
So buy another pair.

22:36.298 --> 22:38.199
Buy another pair.
That's genius.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.467
A really genius idea.
Thanks for that.

22:40.502 --> 22:42.603
- I just meant--
- It doesn't matter.

22:42.637 --> 22:44.505
( Sighs ) Just ask your mom.

22:44.539 --> 22:47.441
My mom just bought me
these two months ago.

22:47.475 --> 22:49.176
There's no way
she's going to spring

22:49.211 --> 22:50.511
for a brand-new
pair now.

22:50.545 --> 22:52.279
Just for the auditions?

22:52.314 --> 22:53.347
Especially since she thinks

22:53.381 --> 22:54.481
there's no way I'm getting in.

22:54.516 --> 22:56.483
- That's not true.
- <i>It's completely true!</i>

22:56.518 --> 22:58.586
She thinks I'm a loser,
and that I'm totally

22:58.620 --> 23:01.188
gonna crap out along with
everybody else in this place.

23:01.223 --> 23:02.523
- She didn't say that.
- She didn't have to.

23:02.557 --> 23:04.491
- The cake did.
- What cake?

23:04.526 --> 23:06.393
The cake in the fridge
with the frosting that says,

23:06.428 --> 23:07.494
"better luck next year!"

23:07.529 --> 23:10.164
With a stupid exclamation
point at the end.

23:10.198 --> 23:11.599
She probably buys them in bulk.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.334
<i>Look, your mom is just--</i>

23:13.368 --> 23:16.370
Don't say anything
about my mom.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.478
Wow, truly. These
curtains-- they're great.

23:24.512 --> 23:26.213
I'm happy with them.

23:26.248 --> 23:28.382
I mean we didn't even
discuss color or style,

23:28.416 --> 23:29.550
but it's as if we did.

23:29.584 --> 23:30.618
They're exactly what I want.

23:30.652 --> 23:32.453
- I know.
- But how do you know?

23:32.487 --> 23:34.221
How do you know what I want?

23:34.256 --> 23:35.389
I've always been able
to tell exactly

23:35.423 --> 23:37.258
what everybody wants,
except for me.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.460
Well, they're perfect.

23:39.494 --> 23:41.395
Really. Unfortunately,
hanging them's

23:41.429 --> 23:42.630
- out of the question.
- Why?

23:42.664 --> 23:45.633
Ah, I had a little disagreement
with the tension rods.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.568
Big emphasis on the
word "tension."

23:47.602 --> 23:49.403
I don't if Al Qaeda has
heard of these things,

23:49.437 --> 23:51.405
but mailing one to every
household in America

23:51.439 --> 23:53.440
would bring us to our knees.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.475
What are those?

23:55.610 --> 23:58.245
- Curtain rods.
- Wow, they're perfect.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.546
You really do know
everything about everyone

23:59.581 --> 24:01.382
except yourself.

24:01.416 --> 24:03.450
Anything you need me
to help you out with,

24:03.485 --> 24:06.453
or if you need me to be nurse
Jackie with the tools,

24:06.488 --> 24:08.289
passing them up to you,
I'm at the ready.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.357
Could you get me a pen
so I can mark for a screw?

24:10.392 --> 24:13.193
Absolutely. Pen pen
pen pen pen pen

24:13.228 --> 24:14.528
pen pen pen pen pen pen.

24:14.562 --> 24:16.297
I do not have a pen.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.465
They all got lost in the great
Vegas furniture onslaught

24:18.500 --> 24:20.367
of 2012.

24:20.402 --> 24:21.568
- I'll make do.
- Yeah.

24:26.641 --> 24:28.509
So how's that Fanny doing?

24:28.543 --> 24:30.477
You unlucky enough to get
in her path lately?

24:30.512 --> 24:32.313
- I haven't seen her.
- Well, I have,

24:32.347 --> 24:33.347
and my ears are still ringing.

24:33.381 --> 24:35.149
She lost her mind
in the studio.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.484
- It was crazy.
- She's definitely on edge these days.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.586
I know, but I'm
wondering if she hasn't

24:39.621 --> 24:41.588
lost perspective on all this.

24:41.623 --> 24:43.257
Can you pass me
the Phillips head.

24:43.291 --> 24:44.425
Uh, sure.

24:44.459 --> 24:47.161
I mean she's hosted them
for so many years.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.562
She's done it.
It's time to relax.

24:48.596 --> 24:50.197
Do you know which one
the Phillips head is?

24:50.231 --> 24:52.299
Uh, yeah.
It's the--

24:52.334 --> 24:55.369
- No.
- Just bring me what you find.

24:55.403 --> 24:57.204
Plus the money.
I mean, she pays

24:57.238 --> 24:58.539
for all these improvements
on the property,

24:58.573 --> 25:00.441
so she's actually losing
money on the thing.

25:00.475 --> 25:01.575
Flathead.
Phillips head.

25:01.609 --> 25:03.143
- Who's Phillip?
- I don't know.

25:03.178 --> 25:04.578
And hey,

25:04.612 --> 25:07.314
bottom line--
it's about the girls.

25:07.349 --> 25:08.415
This is for them.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.551
Can I just say something
about all of this?

25:10.585 --> 25:13.554
- Yes. Please.
- You know Fanny's story, right?

25:13.588 --> 25:14.588
The gist of it.

25:16.358 --> 25:18.158
Fanny started dancing at four.

25:18.193 --> 25:19.460
She was <i>en pointe at age 9,</i>

25:19.494 --> 25:21.528
won her first dance
competition at age 10.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.132
She was invited to dance at Ballet
de Russe de Monte Carlo at age 16.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.500
Fanny was
a professional at an age

25:26.534 --> 25:28.168
where you and I were
mastering the curling iron

25:28.203 --> 25:29.503
and writing fan letters
to Jason priestly.

25:29.537 --> 25:31.238
- He was handsome.
- He still is.

25:31.272 --> 25:32.573
- Yeah.
- Fanny could have gone

25:32.607 --> 25:34.341
anywhere she wanted to go,

25:34.376 --> 25:35.409
then she fell in love.

25:35.443 --> 25:37.144
Got pregnant.

25:37.178 --> 25:38.479
She was gonna go back,
but she never did.

25:38.513 --> 25:40.481
She gave it up, so...

25:40.515 --> 25:42.583
This studio, these girls,

25:42.617 --> 25:44.585
her teaching, her business,

25:44.619 --> 25:47.421
her reputation--

25:47.455 --> 25:48.522
this is all she has.

25:50.525 --> 25:52.326
Yeah.

25:52.360 --> 25:53.527
I guess so.

25:55.363 --> 25:58.165
( Sighs deeply ) I took a big
chunk of my blue paint out

25:58.199 --> 25:59.466
when I was trying to put
the tension rod up,

25:59.501 --> 26:01.535
so I'll need to get
some to match.

26:01.569 --> 26:03.170
You are good.

29:11.586 --> 29:13.720
Ah. Hey,
I love that.

29:13.754 --> 29:14.988
You have one
of those welcome bells.

29:15.022 --> 29:16.690
Very Mayberry.

29:16.724 --> 29:17.724
Can we help you?

29:17.758 --> 29:19.793
Yes. Hi, my name
is Michelle.

29:20.795 --> 29:22.596
- Bob.
- Don.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.531
Bob and don.
Nice to meet you.

29:24.565 --> 29:25.866
So I am new in town.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.767
I moved here about
a month ago or so.

29:27.802 --> 29:29.769
And I'm at the
flowers place on Forster.

29:29.804 --> 29:31.705
- Do you know it?
- Sure. Fanny's place.

29:31.739 --> 29:33.640
Right.
Fanny's place.

29:33.674 --> 29:35.008
And so now
I'm there with Fanny,

29:35.042 --> 29:36.877
and she has that dance studio.

29:36.911 --> 29:37.878
And there's an event coming up

29:37.912 --> 29:39.813
for which we need
your expertise.

29:39.847 --> 29:40.981
My niece takes classes there.

29:41.015 --> 29:42.716
- Katrina.
- Nice.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.551
Don't know her. But there's
a connection here.

29:44.585 --> 29:46.553
That's good.
So the event

29:46.587 --> 29:49.656
is the prestigious Joffrey
summer program auditions,

29:49.690 --> 29:50.891
and we need help
with our dance floor.

29:50.925 --> 29:51.992
We're got some loose boards,

29:52.026 --> 29:53.593
it needs a sanding, buffing.

29:53.628 --> 29:54.761
And according to your website,

29:54.795 --> 29:55.962
you offer those services.

29:55.997 --> 29:57.664
We're at your disposal.

29:57.698 --> 29:59.566
Yeah, we can get a couple
guys out there in an hour.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.568
- When do you need 'em?
- Now. Yesterday.

30:01.602 --> 30:02.802
This is great.
Thank you.

30:02.837 --> 30:04.871
We'll just come out and
assess everything first.

30:04.906 --> 30:06.873
And then we just
need 50% up front,

30:06.908 --> 30:10.043
- and we can get started.
- Ah, there's the rub.

30:10.077 --> 30:12.579
We don't have
the 50% right now.

30:12.613 --> 30:14.681
Ah well. That could
be a problem.

30:14.715 --> 30:16.917
But you know what? Why don't
you give me a ballpark figure

30:16.951 --> 30:18.018
of what the cost is?

30:18.052 --> 30:20.053
And maybe we do have the 50%.

30:20.087 --> 30:21.721
Well, let's see.

30:21.756 --> 30:24.057
Uh, we replace even just
a few of the boards,

30:24.091 --> 30:25.659
the sanding, the whole thing,

30:25.693 --> 30:26.960
that's about 700
square feet or so.

30:26.994 --> 30:28.028
I'd say eight.

30:28.062 --> 30:29.696
And doing the finish--

30:29.730 --> 30:30.931
the coats and all--
it'll be at least

30:30.965 --> 30:32.899
- $2200.
- Or more.

30:32.934 --> 30:34.668
Yeah, we don't have the 50%.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.836
We might have 10% of the 50%.

30:36.871 --> 30:38.071
- Would that make this happen?
- I can't do it.

30:38.105 --> 30:39.806
I gotta get my guys paid.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.641
And the balance
is due on completion.

30:41.676 --> 30:44.010
So you should kinda
have 100% of it now.

30:44.045 --> 30:46.680
Right. Fair enough. Fair enough.

30:46.714 --> 30:48.682
Oh hey! I didn't think
of this before.

30:48.716 --> 30:49.783
Do you guys do layaway?

30:49.817 --> 30:50.850
- Uh...
- See, when I was a kid,

30:50.885 --> 30:52.919
there was this store
called contempo casuals,

30:52.954 --> 30:55.855
and you could put a really cute
outfit on layaway in June,

30:55.890 --> 30:57.090
for say, three months.
And as long as

30:57.124 --> 30:58.692
you didn't get fat
by September,

30:58.726 --> 30:59.726
you'd have a really
cute outfit.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.994
When do you pay for the outfit?

31:01.028 --> 31:02.629
When you pick it up
in September.

31:02.663 --> 31:03.964
- It's a fall outfit.
- I'm not sure how

31:03.998 --> 31:05.865
that corresponds to us
to fixing that floor.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.867
Yeah, 'cause when
we fix it and are done,

31:07.902 --> 31:10.036
it's the same as you
paying for the dress.

31:10.071 --> 31:11.838
You pay when you get the thing.

31:11.872 --> 31:13.006
That's one way
of looking at it.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.674
The other way
of looking at it is...

31:14.709 --> 31:15.842
It's fun!

31:15.876 --> 31:17.577
Sorry.

31:17.612 --> 31:18.745
Okay.

31:18.779 --> 31:20.780
I took a shot.
Thanks for your time.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.059
- Bob, right?
- Yup.

31:33.094 --> 31:34.828
Bob--
short for Robert?

31:34.862 --> 31:36.830
It's a nice, solid name.

31:36.864 --> 31:38.665
I like this vest too.

31:38.699 --> 31:40.600
Says workin' man.

31:40.635 --> 31:42.669
Strong workin' man.

31:42.703 --> 31:43.837
Knows his Phillips heads.

31:43.871 --> 31:44.871
You need something else?

31:44.905 --> 31:46.039
Yes. Bob,

31:46.073 --> 31:48.775
you are looking at
a damsel in distress.

31:48.809 --> 31:50.877
She is desperately
in need of a knight

31:50.911 --> 31:52.712
to come
and rescue her--

31:52.747 --> 31:54.881
white horse optional.

31:54.915 --> 31:56.049
Be my knight, Bob.

31:56.083 --> 31:57.951
I'm sorry.
We can't extend credit.

31:57.985 --> 31:58.985
Nothing personal.

32:00.021 --> 32:02.022
Yeah, yeah.
I get it.

32:08.062 --> 32:09.763
Don, right?

32:09.797 --> 32:10.997
Short for Donald.

32:11.032 --> 32:12.632
Donick, actually.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.034
Even better.

32:14.068 --> 32:15.035
No vest for you, huh?

32:15.069 --> 32:17.070
- We can't help you.
- Okay.

32:20.708 --> 32:22.709
So...

32:22.743 --> 32:24.644
No one wants to do me
or your floors.

32:24.679 --> 32:26.980
- What are you talking about?
- Is there a libido issue in this area?

32:27.014 --> 32:27.981
Has something in the water

32:28.015 --> 32:29.616
killed off all the testosterone

32:29.650 --> 32:31.651
in the town of paradise?
Or have I very suddenly lost

32:31.686 --> 32:33.820
- all my skills to seduce?
- Who are you trying to seduce?

32:33.854 --> 32:35.655
- The hardware store guys.
- Bob and don?

32:35.690 --> 32:37.624
- Yes.
- Fat Bob and Skinny Don?

32:37.658 --> 32:38.658
Bob had a tummy, yes.

32:38.693 --> 32:40.727
- Bob and don?!
- Bob and don, yes!

32:40.761 --> 32:42.796
- For sex?
- No! To do our floors.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.964
I strutted my stuff a little bit
to get them to do it on layaway

32:44.999 --> 32:47.000
like contempo casuals,
and they turned their backs.

32:47.034 --> 32:48.902
Will I ever be able to
go in that store again?

32:48.936 --> 32:50.003
I'd give it some time.

32:51.806 --> 32:53.740
This is
a weird-ass chair.

32:53.774 --> 32:55.975
Why are you suddenly involving
yourself with my floors?

32:56.010 --> 32:57.577
Because I've made it
my mission.

32:57.611 --> 32:58.745
And when I make
something my mission,

32:58.779 --> 33:00.680
I don't rest until
it's mission accomplished.

33:00.715 --> 33:02.515
I'm going to get
those floors fixed.

33:02.550 --> 33:03.717
I'm going to get
the auditions back.

33:03.751 --> 33:05.819
- It's too late.
- It's not too late.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.922
Fix the floors, show Joffrey the
Ojai stats on animal abuse,

33:08.956 --> 33:10.724
and mushroom consumption.
We'll get 'em back!

33:10.758 --> 33:12.892
- I still don't understand why--
- I did some research.

33:12.927 --> 33:15.729
I found an Internet cafe,
went online, found a town--

33:15.763 --> 33:16.963
a bigger town north of here

33:16.997 --> 33:19.532
with multiple resources
for fixing a dance floor.

33:19.567 --> 33:20.900
Friendly-looking guys
featured in the ads.

33:20.935 --> 33:22.502
Can't tell how horny they are,

33:22.536 --> 33:23.570
but I'll find out
when I get there!

33:23.604 --> 33:25.572
- What town?
- Oh, it's a weird name,

33:25.606 --> 33:27.741
like a joke name--
almost a dirty name.

33:27.775 --> 33:28.842
Oxnard.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.877
Now get in the car.
We're driving to Oxnard.

33:30.911 --> 33:32.879
I've spent my whole life
avoiding Oxnard.

33:32.913 --> 33:34.748
- So you know it?
- Of course I know it.

33:34.782 --> 33:37.751
Well, we are both Oxnard-bound
and I am willing to flirt

33:37.785 --> 33:40.754
with multiple Oxnardians, because
Joffrey's not going to Ojai!

33:40.788 --> 33:41.921
Times a wastin.'

33:41.956 --> 33:43.957
- this is ridiculous.
- I'm on a mission.

33:54.769 --> 33:55.835
What are these?

33:55.870 --> 33:57.570
My lame dad got them for me.

33:57.605 --> 33:58.671
They're totally wrong,
and I just thought

33:58.706 --> 33:59.706
maybe you'd want them.

33:59.740 --> 34:00.774
Oh my God.
They're brand-new.

34:00.808 --> 34:01.941
I never wore them.

34:01.976 --> 34:03.943
- They're my size.
- Yeah, he's an idiot.

34:03.978 --> 34:05.478
He bought them way too big.

34:05.513 --> 34:06.679
Three sizes too big?

34:06.714 --> 34:07.847
Yeah, that's the thing,
right? I mean, what?

34:07.882 --> 34:09.549
He's walking down
an aisle of dancewear

34:09.583 --> 34:10.784
and he has a stroke
or something?

34:10.818 --> 34:11.951
But your dad buys
everything for you.

34:11.985 --> 34:13.652
- Why would he sudden--
- Look, throw them out,

34:13.687 --> 34:14.687
set 'em on fire, whatever.

34:14.722 --> 34:15.989
I just don't need 'em, okay?

34:24.732 --> 34:26.933
- Almost there.
- Good.

34:26.967 --> 34:29.702
Best view of Oxnard is
in the rearview mirror.

34:29.737 --> 34:31.538
Ah, you should tweet that.

34:31.572 --> 34:32.605
I don't do that.

34:32.639 --> 34:33.606
Me neither.

34:33.641 --> 34:34.774
I do.

34:34.809 --> 34:35.809
You tweet?

34:35.842 --> 34:37.510
That's surprising to me.

34:37.545 --> 34:39.579
Yeah, it's a good way
to keep in touch with family.

34:39.612 --> 34:42.614
You know, keep 'em posted
on your comings and goings.

34:42.650 --> 34:43.783
Right.

34:43.818 --> 34:44.818
I usually think of it

34:44.851 --> 34:46.652
as just something
celebrities do.

34:46.687 --> 34:48.655
- ( Man chuckles )
- Makes sense though.

34:48.688 --> 34:50.857
Okay. This is it.

34:56.597 --> 34:58.665
Wow, nice space.

34:58.699 --> 34:59.699
There's the wood you ordered,

34:59.733 --> 35:00.867
all stacked up.

35:00.901 --> 35:02.902
There's a bathroom upstairs.

35:02.937 --> 35:04.904
I'll bring some soda
and snacks out for you.

35:04.939 --> 35:06.773
I'll get started right now.

35:09.510 --> 35:10.710
This is weird.

35:10.744 --> 35:12.745
- Why? He's qualified.
- We don't even know his name.

35:12.780 --> 35:14.647
- Floyd. It's Floyd.
- Last name?

35:14.682 --> 35:16.749
He said it at one point--
Prelutsky or something like that.

35:16.784 --> 35:17.917
Okay. We're fine vetters.

35:17.952 --> 35:19.486
They should put us
in charge of finding

35:19.520 --> 35:20.653
vice-presidential
candidates.

35:20.688 --> 35:21.821
We don't need to know
his last name.

35:21.856 --> 35:23.490
He was just so available.

35:23.524 --> 35:24.591
I don't like that.

35:24.625 --> 35:25.825
Oh, is that how you
judge things like this?

35:25.860 --> 35:27.660
If people are willing to do
what you want them to do,

35:27.695 --> 35:28.828
- then you don't want them?
- No.

35:28.863 --> 35:30.497
It's just he was
our fourth choice.

35:30.531 --> 35:31.598
What is it with floor guys?

35:31.632 --> 35:32.665
They don't like you,
that's for sure.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.501
I think it's
the California coast.

35:34.535 --> 35:36.503
For some reason, I'm
not hot in California.

35:36.537 --> 35:38.838
Especially Oxnard.
Ugh. Oxnard.

35:38.873 --> 35:40.507
Told you.

35:40.541 --> 35:41.941
So how much is Floyd getting?

35:41.976 --> 35:45.778
Nothing. We talked and he's
gonna let me pay him later.

35:45.813 --> 35:48.648
Did you seduce him,
Mrs. Robinson?

35:48.682 --> 35:50.650
- To do a degree.
- Coo coo ca choo.

35:50.684 --> 35:51.851
It's not like that.

35:51.886 --> 35:53.686
What is Floyd expecting?

35:53.721 --> 35:54.854
To fix the floors,
sleep on our cot

35:54.889 --> 35:56.923
and leave in the morning--
nothing else.

35:56.957 --> 35:58.925
Okay. Got it.

35:58.959 --> 36:00.560
Sleep with a baseball bat.

36:00.594 --> 36:02.462
Young lady, when you
get to be my age,

36:02.496 --> 36:04.831
you know how to lead a man on,
get him to do what you want,

36:04.865 --> 36:07.500
give him nothing and send him
crying back to his wife.

36:07.535 --> 36:10.503
Okay. Just...
Be safe.

36:10.538 --> 36:11.738
As long as he does the floors.

36:11.772 --> 36:12.872
And not you.

36:17.465 --> 36:19.178
Good morning, Lisa.

36:19.298 --> 36:20.497
Fanny!

36:20.731 --> 36:22.150
Lisa from the Joffrey.

36:22.270 --> 36:24.179
- Ah, nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

36:24.299 --> 36:25.866
The floors look wonderful.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.134
I was going
to fax you about it.

36:27.168 --> 36:28.836
- Thank you.
- <i>A couple of days ago,</i>

36:28.870 --> 36:31.005
I had to fax the studio in Ojai

36:31.039 --> 36:32.239
with the news
we weren't coming.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.108
They faxed back that
they were disappointed.

36:34.142 --> 36:35.109
That's too bad.

36:35.143 --> 36:36.143
Well, time to get started.

36:36.177 --> 36:37.244
Looks like we have
a good group here.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.246
Bye.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.982
She said bye. Surprised
she didn't fax it.

36:42.017 --> 36:43.817
I never doubted they'd
want to be here.

36:43.852 --> 36:45.152
Oh, right.
Yeah, not for a moment.

36:45.186 --> 36:48.155
Lisa: <i>Gather around,
everybody, please.</i>

36:48.189 --> 36:50.257
<i>Gather around.</i>

36:50.291 --> 36:53.927
Good morning, everyone.
Welcome to the 2012

36:53.962 --> 36:56.163
Joffrey summer
program auditions.

36:56.197 --> 36:58.799
We're going to get
started in just a minute.

36:58.833 --> 36:59.900
Listen for
your numbers, please.

36:59.934 --> 37:01.168
And good luck.

37:01.202 --> 37:03.270
<i>( Guitar music playing )</i>
<i>( Woman vocalizing )</i>

37:05.807 --> 37:07.808
Lisa: <i>All right, this is
to confirm the people</i>

37:07.842 --> 37:09.877
<i>in my first group.</i>

37:09.911 --> 37:12.212
<i>Number 23, warden.</i>

37:12.247 --> 37:15.149
<i>Number 18, Connely.</i>

37:15.183 --> 37:18.052
<i>Number 26, Waggeman.</i>

37:18.086 --> 37:20.988
<i>Number 16, Jordan.</i>

37:21.022 --> 37:22.222
<i>Number 62--</i>

37:22.257 --> 37:24.858
All right, front row seats.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.861
Ooh, first group's going in.

37:27.896 --> 37:29.863
You got boo and Sasha
in that one. Exciting.

37:29.898 --> 37:32.866
( Gasps ) Here's
something else exciting.

37:32.901 --> 37:33.967
Excellent.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.202
You know...

37:35.236 --> 37:37.037
I forgot to ask
you about Floyd.

37:37.072 --> 37:39.173
- What about him?
- He did okay on the floor.

37:39.207 --> 37:42.042
- Obviously.
- He fix anything else?

37:42.077 --> 37:43.911
There's nothing else
that needed fixing.

37:43.945 --> 37:47.147
Waxed everything
that needed... waxing?

37:47.182 --> 37:49.983
- He seemed to.
- Next morning he...

37:50.018 --> 37:52.953
- Got off okay?
- He got off just fine.

37:52.987 --> 37:54.221
- ( Chuckles )
- What?

37:54.255 --> 37:57.324
- You said "got off."
- Pour the wine.

37:58.993 --> 38:01.195
( Sighs ) It's a big
day for boo, huh?

38:01.229 --> 38:02.930
And all of them.

38:02.964 --> 38:04.932
This is such
a wonderful experience--

38:04.966 --> 38:06.934
just to dance and be seen.

38:06.968 --> 38:08.102
It doesn't matter what happens.

38:08.136 --> 38:10.037
It only matters
that they're here.

38:10.071 --> 38:11.105
I'll drink to that.

38:14.843 --> 38:15.876
Boo, what happened?

38:15.910 --> 38:16.877
I got cut.

38:16.911 --> 38:18.779
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

38:18.813 --> 38:19.913
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

38:19.948 --> 38:21.181
- Rayray, get the box.
- <i>Roger!</i>

38:21.216 --> 38:23.183
- Really? The box?
- What box?

38:23.218 --> 38:24.818
- Get over here.
- What are you doing?

38:24.853 --> 38:26.186
Shh. You're
going back in.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.788
She can't just go back in.

38:27.822 --> 38:28.956
Yeah, Fanny.
I was cut.

38:28.990 --> 38:30.023
You were not cut.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.025
No one cuts one
of my girls that fast.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.961
- Rayray: <i>Got it!</i>
<i>- Hurry.</i>

38:33.995 --> 38:36.029
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?

38:36.064 --> 38:37.965
<i>Ah, here it is.</i>

38:37.999 --> 38:39.133
Now don't fight me.

38:39.167 --> 38:40.868
- Ow!
- Ah, sorry.

38:40.902 --> 38:41.869
Is this really happening?

38:41.903 --> 38:44.037
This was made
for a much smaller head.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.040
It was for swan Hilda
in my 1996 "Coppelia."

38:47.075 --> 38:48.976
Girl had a head
the size of a peanut.

38:49.010 --> 38:50.911
Now you're Trina
from Simi Valley

38:50.945 --> 38:52.246
if anyone asks.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.314
So get in there, and show
them what what Trina’s got.

38:54.349 --> 38:56.016
Trina, Simi Valley--
Got it!

38:57.185 --> 38:59.253
- But how do you figure?
- More, please.

38:59.287 --> 39:01.255
- But she--
- More, please.

39:01.289 --> 39:03.157
Holy hell, what's with us?

39:03.191 --> 39:06.093
That was crazy, what you just did
with boo there. I'm just saying.

39:06.127 --> 39:08.929
It's not crazy. It's the point
of being in a competition.

39:08.963 --> 39:10.964
- To compete.
- But they had just seen her.

39:10.999 --> 39:12.132
- They did not see her.
- They saw her.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.201
- And they cut her.
- They did not see her.

39:14.235 --> 39:16.136
- Boo?
- Well?

39:16.171 --> 39:18.906
- Trina got cut.
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.208
- But you gave it a good--
- Rayray, give me your legwarmers.

39:21.242 --> 39:22.943
- Rayray: <i>Coming!
- Michelle: You've got to be kidding me.</i>

39:22.977 --> 39:24.011
Get that thing off your head.

39:24.045 --> 39:25.279
This is astonishing!

39:25.313 --> 39:26.847
Ooh pretty dirty.

39:26.881 --> 39:28.882
If anyone asks,
say you live on a farm.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.050
Legwarmers.

39:30.084 --> 39:31.285
- Put 'em on.
- It's like being backstage

39:31.319 --> 39:32.319
at "the Carol Burnett show."

39:32.353 --> 39:33.921
Quick.
Get it into a bun.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.088
- Me?
- Yes. Hurry!

39:35.123 --> 39:37.324
Uh, well maybe something
other than a bun.

39:37.358 --> 39:39.159
- Like what?
- Let's do a ponytail.

39:39.194 --> 39:40.928
Joffrey doesn't like ponytails.

39:40.962 --> 39:41.929
How did I get pulled into this?

39:41.963 --> 39:43.263
- Just do a bun!
- But a ponytail

39:43.298 --> 39:45.098
will make her really stand out.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.166
I went to an audition once.

39:46.201 --> 39:48.168
Everyone was in a bun,
but I was in a ponytail.

39:48.203 --> 39:49.336
And people were like, "who's
the girl in the ponytail?"

39:49.370 --> 39:51.171
- Got me the job!
- Let's do a ponytail!

39:51.206 --> 39:52.940
Fine. Do it.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.174
- Your name is Selma.
- What's my last name?

39:54.209 --> 39:56.276
- Alabama?
- Just tell them Selma.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.311
Run run!

39:59.214 --> 40:01.348
Crazy times five.

40:01.382 --> 40:03.283
You don't know
how auditions work.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.953
Yes, I do. You dance
for Gary Janetti,

40:05.987 --> 40:07.955
he looks up,
says "no," you're done.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.156
- Who?
- Never mind.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.991
You really don't
get it, do you?

40:12.126 --> 40:14.194
- I guess not.
- Boo is not being seen.

40:14.229 --> 40:16.129
- Come again?
- Well, look at all the girls

40:16.164 --> 40:17.197
that she's gone
in with--

40:17.232 --> 40:18.966
stick insects with tiny legs

40:19.000 --> 40:19.967
and tiny butts.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.134
And when boo comes in,

40:21.169 --> 40:23.070
beautiful as she is,
all they see is

40:23.104 --> 40:24.905
how she doesn't look
like the other girls,

40:24.939 --> 40:26.073
so they cut her.

40:26.107 --> 40:28.242
But eventually,
if she keeps going in--

40:28.276 --> 40:30.310
and I don't care
how many times it takes--

40:30.345 --> 40:32.246
she will get into
a group with someone

40:32.280 --> 40:34.915
who has bigger legs
and a bigger butt,

40:34.949 --> 40:36.183
and then she will be seen.

40:36.217 --> 40:38.085
You're mad.

40:38.119 --> 40:40.087
But making sense.
Maybe I'm mad?

40:40.121 --> 40:41.255
- Guess what?
- What?

40:41.289 --> 40:43.056
- Selma got cut.
- ( Sighs ) Darn.

40:43.091 --> 40:45.125
- Find the plastic nose.
- No Fanny, it's fine.

40:45.159 --> 40:48.061
They thought I was dynamic
and had great form.

40:48.096 --> 40:49.963
Well, they thought
Trina had great form,

40:49.998 --> 40:51.231
and Selma was dynamic.

40:51.266 --> 40:52.366
They only one they
didn't like was me.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.067
Yay?

40:54.102 --> 40:55.235
They also said that I should

40:55.270 --> 40:56.970
definitely try again next year,

40:57.005 --> 40:58.939
'cause the underdog slot
was already used up.

40:58.973 --> 40:59.973
Aww.

41:01.976 --> 41:03.310
You done good, kiddo.

41:03.344 --> 41:05.212
Thanks.

41:05.246 --> 41:07.014
I <i>fouetted</i> in a wig.

41:08.283 --> 41:10.284
Boo, can I get
my legwarmers back?

41:12.987 --> 41:15.155
Now she has been seen.

41:19.260 --> 41:23.163
( Dancers chattering )

41:23.197 --> 41:25.299
Sasha?

41:25.333 --> 41:26.266
How'd it go?

41:26.301 --> 41:29.036
Okay, I guess.

41:29.070 --> 41:32.005
I bet you were great.

41:32.040 --> 41:35.242
So, you wanna come over
for some failure cake?

41:35.276 --> 41:38.011
Yeah.

41:38.046 --> 41:40.881
But I kind of have to stay
and fill out some forms.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.884
Oh.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.018
I'll wait.
