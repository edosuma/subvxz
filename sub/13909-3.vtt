WEBVTT

00:04.013 --> 00:06.011
AND EVERYTHING NICE.

00:06.013 --> 00:10.004
THESE WERE THE INGREDIENTS
CHOSEN TO CREATE
THE PERFECT LITTLE GIRL.

00:10.006 --> 00:14.021
BUT PROFESSOR UTONIUM
ACCIDENTALLY ADDED AN EXTRA
INGREDIENT TO THE CONCOCTION--

00:14.023 --> 00:16.006
CHEMICAL X.

00:16.008 --> 00:18.014
[EXPLOSION]

00:18.016 --> 00:22.006
THUS THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
WERE BORN!

00:22.008 --> 00:24.008
USING THEIR ULTRA-SUPERPOWERS,

00:24.010 --> 00:28.006
BLOSSOM, BUBBLES, AND BUTTERCUP
HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES

00:28.008 --> 00:32.013
TO FIGHTING CRIME
AND THE FORCES OF EVIL!

01:18.008 --> 01:21.005
WHERE YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO BE.

01:21.007 --> 01:22.026
AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'LL BE LEARNING ABOUT

01:22.028 --> 01:24.021
TODAY ON CAREER DAY.

01:24.023 --> 01:26.001
[APPLAUSE]

01:26.003 --> 01:28.001
GOOD MORNING,
BOYS AND GIRLS.

01:28.003 --> 01:30.027
AND GOOD MORNING
TO OUR PARENTS, TOO.

01:30.029 --> 01:33.012
GOOD MORNING,
MS. KEANE.

01:33.014 --> 01:34.026
BOYS AND GIRLS,

01:34.028 --> 01:37.022
WE ARE GOING TO BE LEARNING
ABOUT CAREERS TODAY.

01:37.024 --> 01:40.001
A CAREER IS
WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING

01:40.003 --> 01:41.021
WHEN YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

01:41.023 --> 01:43.002
AND TO HELP US OUT,

01:43.004 --> 01:45.028
SOME SPECIAL GROWNUPS--
YOUR PARENTS--

01:46.000 --> 01:49.016
ARE GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT
WHAT THEY DO FOR THEIR CAREER.

01:49.018 --> 01:54.020
YOU'LL SEE THAT
DIFFERENT GROWNUPS HAVE
CHOSEN DIFFERENT CAREERS.

01:54.022 --> 01:58.003
IT ALL DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

01:58.005 --> 02:00.022
NOW, BOYS AND GIRLS,
DO ANY OF YOU KNOW

02:00.024 --> 02:03.007
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

02:03.009 --> 02:04.020
RAISE YOUR HANDS
IF YOU DO.

02:06.020 --> 02:09.002
WELL, A LOT OF YOU
HAVE AN IDEA

02:09.004 --> 02:11.005
FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,
AND THAT'S GREAT.

02:11.007 --> 02:14.024
AND MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW YET,
AND THAT'S OK TOO.

02:14.026 --> 02:18.008
MAYBE AFTER HEARING SOME
OF OUR PARENTS TALK ABOUT
WHAT THEY DO,

02:18.010 --> 02:21.029
YOU GUYS WILL BE INSPIRED
TO MAKE SOME CAREER CHOICES
OF YOUR OWN.

02:22.001 --> 02:25.011
OUR FIRST PARENT IS...

02:27.010 --> 02:28.024
Man:
BOYS AND GIRLS,

02:28.026 --> 02:31.026
HELLO. MY NAME
IS MR. ANOUSH.

02:31.028 --> 02:35.016
I AM HANOUT'S FATHER.

02:35.018 --> 02:37.023
I WORK IN INSURANCE.

02:37.025 --> 02:42.025
MY COMPANY INSURES BUILDINGS
IN TOWNSVILLE AGAINST DAMAGE.

02:44.015 --> 02:47.029
I AM A <i>VERY</i><i>BUSY MAN.</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:49.002
[APPLAUSE]

02:49.004 --> 02:51.009
WELL, THANK YOU,
MR. ANOUSH.

02:51.011 --> 02:55.001
AND NEXT UP IS
PROFESSOR UTONIUM.

02:55.003 --> 02:56.013
YOU'RE UP,
PROFESSOR.

02:58.001 --> 03:01.009
UM, HELLO.
I'M PROFESSOR UTONIUM,

03:01.011 --> 03:03.019
AND I AM
BLOSSOM, BUBBLES,
AND BUTTERCUP'S...

03:03.021 --> 03:06.021
UH, FATHER
AND, UH, CREATOR.

03:08.005 --> 03:11.029
AHEM. I'M A SCIENTIST.
I INVENT THINGS.

03:12.001 --> 03:16.015
IN FACT, I BROUGHT IN SOMETHING
I RECENTLY INVENTED TO SHOW YOU.

03:17.022 --> 03:21.000
PRESENTING
MY NEWEST INVENTION...

03:21.002 --> 03:23.007
THE TIME PORTAL.

03:29.026 --> 03:32.009
OOH!
OOH!
OOH!

03:32.011 --> 03:34.025
IN MY LONG CAREER
AS A SCIENTIST,

03:34.027 --> 03:37.009
I'D SAY THE TIME PORTAL
IS MY GREATEST--

03:37.011 --> 03:40.026
WELL, SECOND GREATEST
INVENTION EVER.

03:40.028 --> 03:42.025
YOU KNOW, KIDS,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

03:42.027 --> 03:45.029
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
I'D GROW UP TO BE A SCIENTIST.

03:46.001 --> 03:47.025
IN FACT,
SCIENCE WAS SOMETHING

03:47.027 --> 03:50.000
THAT JUST DIDN'T
INTEREST ME AT ALL.

03:50.002 --> 03:52.011
YES, IF THINGS KEPT GOING
THE WAY THEY WERE,

03:52.013 --> 03:57.013
I MIGHT NEVER HAVE GONE INTO
THE SCIENTIFIC FIELD AT ALL.

03:57.015 --> 04:01.011
BUT ONE DAY,
SOMETHING HAPPENED
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.

04:01.013 --> 04:05.001
THIS ONE STRANGE
INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN
I WAS STILL A LAD.

04:05.003 --> 04:09.017
IT INSPIRED ME,
MOTIVATED ME, MOVED ME,

04:09.019 --> 04:13.016
TO GET INTO SCIENCE
AND CREATE THE POWERPUFF GIRLS.

04:13.018 --> 04:16.021
WELL, NOW LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW THIS THING WORKS.

04:16.023 --> 04:20.013
I'LL SET THE PORTAL
FOR THE 16th CENTURY...

04:26.016 --> 04:28.013
AND I'LL USE
THIS SPECIAL TOOL

04:28.015 --> 04:30.002
TO REACH INTO
THE PORTAL.

04:34.029 --> 04:36.013
MY HAT!

04:36.015 --> 04:38.000
OOH, GOT SOMETHING!

04:38.002 --> 04:41.025
HA HA HA! LOOKS LIKE
SOMEONE'S GONNA NEED
A NEW HAT.

04:41.027 --> 04:44.023
LET'S TRY A MORE RECENT DATE,
LIKE YESTERDAY.

04:44.025 --> 04:46.022
HEY, PROFESSOR,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

04:46.024 --> 04:47.027
FOR CAREER DAY TOMORROW?

04:47.029 --> 04:50.012
HUH? HUH? HUH? HUH?

04:50.014 --> 04:53.001
ALL RIGHT,
TIME FOR SCHOOL.

04:54.007 --> 04:56.009
MMM...SO THAT'S
WHERE THEY WENT.

04:56.011 --> 04:58.017
WELL, ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

04:58.019 --> 05:00.005
YES, YOU
IN THE BACK ROW.

05:00.007 --> 05:04.018
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
UH, PROFESSOR UTONIUM,
I HAVE A QUESTION.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.028
YES, MARY?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.012
GOLLY, I WAS
JUST WONDERING...

05:09.014 --> 05:11.008
GO ON. DON'T BE SHY.

05:11.010 --> 05:16.021
WELL, CAN YOU SET
YOUR MACHINE
TO <i>ANY</i><i>TIME?</i>

05:16.023 --> 05:19.008
CERTAINLY. THAT'S
WHAT THESE KNOBS ARE FOR.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.008
AND <i>ANY</i><i>PLACE?</i>

05:21.010 --> 05:22.026
WELL, YES.

05:22.028 --> 05:25.011
THESE KNOBS OVER HERE
DETERMINE THE SPATIAL
COORDINATES.

05:25.013 --> 05:29.003
GEE, SO THAT MEANS
YOU COULD EVEN SET IT

05:29.005 --> 05:33.018
TO THE EXACT TIME AND PLACE
WHERE YOU EXPERIENCED
THE INCIDENT

05:33.020 --> 05:37.026
THAT GOT YOU INTERESTED IN
SCIENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

05:37.028 --> 05:39.018
PROFESSOR?
YES, BLOSSOM?

05:39.020 --> 05:40.029
WELL, I WANTED
TO ASK--

05:41.001 --> 05:43.012
EXCUSE ME,
BLOSSOM,

05:43.014 --> 05:48.007
BUT I WAS NOT FINISHED
WITH MY QUESTIONS!

05:48.009 --> 05:50.009
[PANTING]

05:53.013 --> 05:57.000
BLOSSOM, MARY'S RIGHT.
LET HER FINISH,

05:57.002 --> 06:00.019
AND THEN YOU CAN ASK
YOUR QUESTION.

06:00.021 --> 06:02.005
HUMPH!

06:02.007 --> 06:05.000
PROFESSOR, CAN YOU SET IT TO
THE PARTICULAR TIME AND PLACE?

06:05.002 --> 06:06.000
UM, YES.

06:06.002 --> 06:07.019
CAN YOU DO IT NOW?
RIGHT NOW?

06:07.021 --> 06:09.002
SURE.

06:13.022 --> 06:14.027
DONE.

06:14.029 --> 06:15.029
IT'S SET THEN?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.015
YES. IS THAT ALL, MARY?

06:17.017 --> 06:21.010
[NORMAL VOICE]
YES, THAT'S ALL,
PROFESSOR UTONIUM.

06:21.012 --> 06:24.027
HA HA HA!

06:24.029 --> 06:26.002
MOJO!
MOJO!
MOJO!

06:32.012 --> 06:34.000
YOU COME BACK HERE!

06:34.002 --> 06:35.012
WHOA, GIRLS.

06:35.014 --> 06:36.012
SEE THAT?

06:36.014 --> 06:38.002
IT'S OCCUPIED.

06:38.004 --> 06:39.012
RIGHT NOW
IT'S TRANSPORTING

06:39.014 --> 06:41.011
MOJO JOJO
INTO THE PAST,

06:41.013 --> 06:43.016
WHICH IS A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED
THAN TRANSPORTING

06:43.018 --> 06:45.001
A HAT OR
A SET OF KEYS,

06:45.003 --> 06:46.026
SO IT COULD TAKE
A LITTLE LONGER.

06:46.028 --> 06:49.021
REALLY,
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
IF HE'LL SURVIVE.

06:49.023 --> 06:51.025
IT COULD BE
A ROUGH TRIP
THROUGH THE...

06:51.027 --> 06:54.023
[OMINOUS TONE]
FIFTH DIMENSION.

06:54.025 --> 06:56.020
THE FIFTH DIMENSION?!

06:56.022 --> 06:59.013
YES. THAT'S HOW
THE TIME PORTAL WORKS.

06:59.015 --> 07:03.006
IMAGINE THIS MOUSE TRAPPED
IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL MAZE,

07:03.008 --> 07:06.025
WITH NO IDEA
THERE'S A THIRD DIMENSION
THAT IT CAN MOVE IN.

07:09.003 --> 07:13.016
YES. SO DO WE FIND OURSELVES
IN A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL WORLD,

07:13.018 --> 07:15.006
SEEMINGLY TRAPPED
BY SPACE AND TIME.

07:15.008 --> 07:17.019
UNLESS BY MOVING
IN THE FIFTH DIMENSION,

07:17.021 --> 07:21.001
WE COULD OVERCOME THESE
LIMITATIONS AND IN THEORY
TRAVEL THROUGH TIME.

07:21.003 --> 07:22.012
WELL, WE SHOULD KNOW
PRETTY SOON

07:22.014 --> 07:24.012
IF OUR MONKEY FRIEND
SURVIVES HIS TRIP

07:24.014 --> 07:26.029
THROUGH
THE FIFTH DIMENSION.

07:40.010 --> 07:43.004
[SCREAMING]

08:12.005 --> 08:14.008
HA! LOOKS LIKE HE MADE IT.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.013
ALL RIGHT, PROFESSOR.
WE'RE GOING IN.

08:16.015 --> 08:19.006
YEAH. WE'LL BRING HIM BACK
BEFORE HE CAN DO ANY DAMAGE.

08:19.008 --> 08:20.016
OH, I HOPE SO.

08:20.018 --> 08:22.004
MESSING AROUND
IN THE PAST COULD HAVE

08:22.006 --> 08:24.012
A MAJOR IMPACT
ON OUR PRESENT REALITY.

08:24.014 --> 08:26.022
YES, YOU'LL HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL AS WELL, GIRLS,

08:26.024 --> 08:29.004
NOT TO AFFECT ANYBODY
OR ANYTHING.

08:29.006 --> 08:31.017
THAT MEANS
NO SUPERHERO STUFF.

08:31.019 --> 08:32.024
I MEAN IT.

08:32.026 --> 08:34.029
IF ANYONE IN THE PAST
SAW YOU FLYING

08:35.001 --> 08:36.017
OR USING
YOUR SUPERPOWERS,

08:36.019 --> 08:38.029
THAT COULD HAVE
CONSEQUENCES AS DRASTIC

08:39.001 --> 08:41.002
AS ANYTHING
MOJO MIGHT CAUSE.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.027
AYE AYE, PROFESSOR.
NO SUPERPOWERS.

08:43.029 --> 08:46.024
OK. COME ON, GIRLS.
HOLD HANDS.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.009
HERE WE GO!

08:48.011 --> 08:49.022
BYE-BYE,
PROFESSOR.

08:49.024 --> 08:51.014
GOOD LUCK, GIRLS.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.005
WHOA! WHAT A TRIP.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.011
HMM. WHAT'S THIS?

09:05.013 --> 09:07.008
1959?!

09:07.010 --> 09:09.015
HA HA! IT WORKED!

09:09.017 --> 09:11.011
NOW, WHERE IS HE?

09:11.013 --> 09:14.005
Woman: OK, I'M GOING
TO START THIS MOVIE.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.025
EVERYBODY IN THEIR SEATS?

09:15.027 --> 09:19.007
GOOD. MR. UTONIUM,
CAN YOU PLEASE GET
THE LIGHTS?

09:27.024 --> 09:32.003
<i>AN ORDINARY TOWN</i>
<i>ON AN ORDINARY MAIN STREET.</i>

09:32.005 --> 09:37.026
<i>EXCEPT FOR THE NOT-SO-ORDINARY</i>
<i>ACTIVE VOLCANO.</i>

09:37.028 --> 09:42.001
KIDS, HERE AS IN ANY TOWN
NEAR AN ACTIVE VOLCANO,

09:42.003 --> 09:43.025
IT'S SAFETY FIRST.

09:43.027 --> 09:45.021
<i>JIMMY THOUGHT</i>
<i>IT WOULD BE COOLSVILLE</i>

09:45.023 --> 09:49.006
<i>TO GOOF AROUND</i>
<i>THIS ACTIVE VOLCANO,</i>

09:49.008 --> 09:51.008
<i>AND LOOK WHAT</i>
<i>HAPPENED TO HIM.</i>

<i>LISA LIKED TO HANG OUT</i>
<i>WITH THE WRONG CROWD.</i>

09:59.013 --> 10:02.027
<i>UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER,</i>
<i>IT WAS ALSO THE WRONG PLACE--</i>

10:02.029 --> 10:07.014
<i>AN ACTIVE VOLCANO-- WITH</i>
<i>DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR LISA.</i>

10:13.019 --> 10:17.005

<i>GO ON, JUNIOR.</i>
<i>DAD'S NOT GOING TO BITE.</i>

10:20.024 --> 10:23.027
DAD, IS IT OK
FOR ME TO PLAY
AROUND THE VOLCANO?

10:23.029 --> 10:27.012
SON, I'M GLAD YOU
ASKED THAT QUESTION.

10:27.014 --> 10:30.015

<i>SEE? THAT WASN'T SO BAD.</i>

10:30.017 --> 10:32.012
<i>AND NOW,</i>
<i>THE MAYOR OF TOWNSVILLE</i>

10:32.014 --> 10:34.021
<i>HAS A SPECIAL MESSAGE</i>
<i>ABOUT THE VOLCANO.</i>

10:34.023 --> 10:37.023
HEY, KIDS!
MY FAVORITE THING TO DO

10:37.025 --> 10:40.008
IS TO THROW THINGS
INTO THE VOLCANO.

10:40.010 --> 10:43.003
TRY IT.
IT'S GREAT FUN!

10:43.005 --> 10:45.023
YOU MEAN <i>DON'T</i><i>THROW</i>
THINGS INTO THE VOLCANO.

10:45.025 --> 10:49.010
NO, I MEAN <i>DO</i><i>THROW</i>
THINGS INTO THE VOLCANO.

OH, WE LAVA YOU,
MR. MAYOR.

11:02.026 --> 11:04.016

11:13.012 --> 11:16.012
WELL, I HOPE YOU ALL LEARNED
SOMETHING FROM THE MOVIE.

11:16.014 --> 11:18.020
YES, MISS BELLUM?

11:18.022 --> 11:22.007
I LEARNED THAT THE MAYOR
IS A COMPLETE IDIOT.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.019
YES, WELL...

11:23.021 --> 11:27.019
UM, DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FILM?

11:27.021 --> 11:29.002
UH, YES?

11:29.004 --> 11:30.019
