so much bigger.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.812
-Hey! Luke.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.061
I got my license today.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.813
-Well, that’s great!
Congratulations.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.815

House!

00:23.774 --> 00:25.694
Luke, if you could still do
what you used to do,

00:25.817 --> 00:27.397
we wouldn’t be here.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.148
-I’m always telling you to find
a better work-life balance.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.739
-This isn’t about balance.
This is about

00:30.864 --> 00:32.874
getting out of here
and reassessing my life.

I’m just taking the shortcut.

[dramatic boom]

00:48.632 --> 00:50.682
Nah, it’s perfectly fine.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.680
The biggest thing in these woods
is a raccoon.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.353
There’s no bears or wolves.

00:59.935 --> 01:03.315
No, all the chainsaw murderers
are still at camp.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.732
What’re you even--
Hang on.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.197
Nothing.

01:12.322 --> 01:14.072
[branches breaking]

01:18.620 --> 01:21.750
Look, I’ll be home in ten or so.
Okay, bye.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.930
-Calling Luke Roman.
-[line trilling]

-Please leave a message.
-[answering machine tone]

02:31.985 --> 02:33.945
-Luke! Oh, darn.
I was hoping to talk to you.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.281
I just wanted to let you know
that I’m going to need

02:36.406 --> 02:38.196
a few more days
away from the office.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.915
I’ll be sending you
the contracts

02:40.035 --> 02:41.745
on Bouvier, Santos
and Padgett.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.330
They’re easy closings,
clean titles, approved loans,

02:44.456 --> 02:46.036
you won’t have any problems.

The Dunn-Herberts

It’s probably a good
teaching moment for Zooey.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.423
I’m dealing with some
personal business,

02:53.548 --> 02:56.428
so I’m not sure
when I’ll be back in the office,

02:56.551 --> 02:58.721
but seeing as
nothing ever changes

02:58.845 --> 03:00.595
at the perfect Roman Agency,

03:00.722 --> 03:02.932
I’m sure you have everything
well in hand.

-Toodles.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.480
Hm.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.185
The "toodles" was a bit much.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.480
-[House] It was a nice touch.
Cordial, yet dismissive.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.400
-Yeah. That’s what
I was going for.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.527
-Would you like some tea?

03:18.073 --> 03:19.703
-Yes.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.422
-It’s a hell of a house.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.257
-Yeah, built in 1893,
historic, solid.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.013
-Can’t wait to bulldoze it.
-Well, you need to buy it first.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.676
It’s only polite.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.472
As you can see,
the property line starts here.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.269
The creek is on your side.
Plenty of room to--

03:46.393 --> 03:47.853
-What’s that?
-Well, that is the lot

03:47.978 --> 03:50.058
next to yours. It’s just
a small place, barely a cottage.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.728
-How much?
-I...

03:52.315 --> 03:54.105
I don’t know
if it’s listed for sale.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.904
-If I own that lot,

03:56.027 --> 03:57.857
I don’t need to worry about
the easements.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.238
I could build the pool area
over here

04:00.365 --> 04:01.815
and put the tennis court
over here.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.660
And the guest house
could be way over here,

04:03.785 --> 04:05.245
so I’d hardly ever
need to interact

04:05.370 --> 04:06.910
with visiting relatives.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.999
-I don’t even know
if you’d see them.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.674
-Oh, yeah!

04:14.379 --> 04:15.839
-We’ll reach out
and get a price.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.804
-Don’t worry
about the price. Buy it.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.012
-Maybe we should close
on this property first,

04:21.136 --> 04:22.466
you know,
get the ball rolling.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.216
-We’re going to do
both deals at once.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.848
I could never enjoy this lot

04:26.975 --> 04:28.515
knowing that
I can’t have that lot.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.233
That’s just me.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.273
All or nothing.

The only point of contact
is a law firm in Budapest.

-Swell.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.201
-I reached out
and left a message.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.703
-Yeah, we’re not
liking the odds

06:47.824 --> 06:49.534
that we’re going to hear back
anytime soon.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.579
-So, we have one sale
contingent on two properties.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.703
This cabin in the woods
is creating more drama than the

06:53.830 --> 06:56.420
-million dollar property.
-Mm-hm. Life is funny.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.501
-You know, I could have sworn
there was something

06:58.627 --> 07:00.707
in that house,
watching me.

it was your, um...

07:03.506 --> 07:04.966

-Ah! Maybe it’s growing back,
like a starfish leg.

-No.
Just old-fashioned paranoia.

-What’s today?

to look at houses.

and I am covering.

to shop for a house

07:58.645 --> 08:01.115

a complete waste of my time.

- When?

08:03.233 --> 08:04.983

-Naw,

Lara and Freya

08:06.695 --> 08:08.325
took her for a spin.

you should check in?

play the lottery.

go in here and talk?

09:55.386 --> 09:58.176
a British engineer with an
interest in the occult,

09:58.306 --> 10:03.596
experimented with infrasound,
or low frequency sound.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.614
Less than 20hz.
18.5 to be exact.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.648
Some called it
the spirit frequency.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.491
-[gentle score]
-How’s it work?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.823
-Well, he theorized that sending
vibrations out at that frequency

10:16.950 --> 10:19.240
might start a dialogue with...

10:19.369 --> 10:21.159
God knows what.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.577
So, this disk can be used
like a cochlear implant:

10:25.708 --> 10:27.288
if something extra-normal
reaches out

10:27.418 --> 10:29.298
it should vibrate
your cochlear nerve.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.340
-And start a dialogue.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.723
So, if Luke wears this thing,

10:34.926 --> 10:36.546
he’ll have his
Luke tingle back?

10:37.679 --> 10:39.139
-Well, I’m not certain

10:39.264 --> 10:41.564
that it will enable him
to communicate verbally,

10:41.683 --> 10:44.643
but it should enable
a certain... intuition.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.059
-Mm.
-The sense of a presence.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.614

Can we agree
to never use the term

10:57.031 --> 10:59.621

21:44.303 --> 21:47.853

overthinking the whole thing

21:47.973 --> 21:51.523

their own desires.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.022

their lifestyles

21:57.149 --> 21:59.899

corresponding inventory.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.237
I focused on
what they deeply needed,

22:03.364 --> 22:05.534
not what they said they wanted

22:05.658 --> 22:07.408
because seldom are they
the same thing.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.601

-Yeah.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.976
-On the subject of creepy,
you know those missing kids?

23:16.103 --> 23:17.983
-Yeah, I’ve heard
something about them.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.109

24:27.925 --> 24:29.635
Hey!

24:29.760 --> 24:31.300
You shouldn’t be here.

This is where those--

24:44.400 --> 24:46.070

24:46.193 --> 24:48.573
’Cause it’s about to get
a whole lot better.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.236

24:52.282 --> 24:54.532

24:55.661 --> 24:57.831
So, there are two houses
left on the list

24:57.955 --> 24:59.415
Susan made up for you.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.210
We’re coming up
to the first one...

25:01.333 --> 25:02.713
and...

25:02.835 --> 25:04.545
-we’re driving away!
-What?!

25:04.670 --> 25:06.840
-It’s not right.
Tiny rooms, no natural lighting

25:06.964 --> 25:08.764
and the raccoons in the yard?
Yeah, they’re not

25:08.882 --> 25:10.512
the helpful Disney kind.
They’ll cut a bitch.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.434
-I still wouldn’t mind--
-Nah, you hate it already.

25:12.553 --> 25:16.013
So, moving on to
bachelorette number two.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.350
Here she comes, and...

25:19.476 --> 25:21.016
-there she goes.
-Wait! Slow down.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.905
-Bye!

25:23.022 --> 25:24.522
Two bedrooms, two baths,

25:24.648 --> 25:26.568
fully finished basement
and a home office.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.862
All the stuff you wanted
and none of the shit you need.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.396
-Zooey, can’t we just--?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.529
-Price is on the high side
of your range.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.276
Add in the HOA fees and to
make PITI you’re gonna need

25:35.409 --> 25:37.409
a bake sale every month, which
is going to be impossible. Why?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.576
Because your kitchen
is too frickin’ small!

25:39.705 --> 25:42.295
So, that’s it
for Susan’s houses.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.746

26:18.202 --> 26:19.742
It’s a blood moon tonight.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.960
-Pardon me?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.621
-A blood moon.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.668
The direct sunlight on earth
passes through the atmosphere

26:26.794 --> 26:28.464

26:32.424 --> 26:34.304
Hasn’t happened

26:35.677 --> 26:37.637

No, I do.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.296
They’ve seen a lot.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.428
Most men your age--
our age--

27:59.553 --> 28:02.063
still have the eyes
of adolescent boys.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.023
-Too many Saturday open houses
will do that to a person.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.693
[Kay chuckles]

28:09.688 --> 28:11.558
So, you’re not
seeing anyone?

28:13.609 --> 28:15.149
-Nobody special.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.279
You?

28:17.404 --> 28:18.954
-Mm-mm.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.948
-Well, that’s
about to change.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.458
-You have no idea.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.805
-So, here we are.
The steak tartare.

And the roasted Cornish hen
for the gentleman.

Please?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.936
All living space on one level,
no finished basement.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.901
-Finished basement
was on the list.

29:33.021 --> 29:36.191
-You don’t need one.
There’s tons of storage.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.936
Just picture yourself
in the space.

29:39.069 --> 29:41.699
Your couch, your photos
on the wall,

29:41.822 --> 29:43.912
your favorite meal cooking
in the fully functional,

29:44.032 --> 29:45.492

29:45.617 --> 29:47.907

for what it could be

29:48.036 --> 29:50.076

-Is the neighborhood safe?

29:52.499 --> 29:55.419
-Of course.
You need to be safe.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.884
You need to be happy.
You need sunshine.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.555
But most of all, you need
to come home every night

30:00.674 --> 30:02.724
and close the door
against the world

30:03.510 --> 30:05.720

that loves you back.

something fancier.

you don’t need to be house poor.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.354
You need to be life rich.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.267
I mean, with this house
you can still afford fancy wines

30:15.397 --> 30:16.977
and concert tickets;

30:17.107 --> 30:19.977
vacations somewhere warm and
impractical anniversary gifts.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.570

It’s just simpler

30:46.261 --> 30:47.261
You know,

we’re back to talking business.

a hard sell here.

terribly persuasive.

of irresistibility.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.161
I’m just going to
tell you one thing:

31:15.123 --> 31:16.883
You will never get
nearly as much

31:17.000 --> 31:20.040
as my client is willing to pay
for your property right now.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.461
Ever.

is that the Dunn-Herberts

31:44.361 --> 31:45.861

31:45.987 --> 31:47.777
they’re buyers!

Bad news is, uh...

31:50.409 --> 31:53.539
Yeah. It’s a Rita Weiss listing.

that she has the power to fly,

32:27.320 --> 32:30.110
or to transform herself
into a girl or woman of any age.

she can only survive
