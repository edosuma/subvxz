WEBVTT

03:18.489 --> 03:19.741
Hey, DOV-

03:24.245 --> 03:25.914
Hey, DOV-

03:26.873 --> 03:28.124
Hey, DOV-

03:31.085 --> 03:32.545
Come on, boy.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.589
Hey.

03:35.965 --> 03:36.966
Hey.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.888
Hey, fellow.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.815
No more fucking finals!

03:52.899 --> 03:58.071
Hey, don't do it. Don't go to college.
It's a fucking scam. It fucking sucks!

03:58.154 --> 03:59.155
Leave him alone.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.301
- Hey, Bert, you got any more smokes?
- No.

05:25.283 --> 05:29.037
So it's fat. So what?
I hope she's not anorexic.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.883
Put her there, sport.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.220
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

05:48.056 --> 05:50.975
- Damn! Jesus!
- God damn it, Dennis, no!

05:51.059 --> 05:53.644
No, Dennis, no! No!

05:53.728 --> 05:55.521
Don't hit him or anything.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.609
Everybody knows not to sit next to Dennis!
Mongrel'll give you tetanus.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.737
Yeah, well, maybe you should make a sign.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.031
There's a stream around back
if you want to wash your hand.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.908
I'll get you a towel.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.715
Hey, pal, do you think it's a smart idea,
leaving your kid out here

06:22.799 --> 06:24.675
where he might be a danger to people?

06:24.759 --> 06:26.511
Just what are you saying, exactly?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.180
Well, I'm just saying if such an incident

06:29.263 --> 06:33.768
were to bring about a "lawsuit,"
you might be held liable.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.603
Forget it. Jeff, save it for law school.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.485
Cute kid.

07:05.716 --> 07:06.843
Hey.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.304
Hi, there.

07:11.055 --> 07:14.642
What's your name? Yeah! Okay.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.271
You like that? You like how that feels?

07:18.438 --> 07:22.650
You shut it. You shut it good, boy.
You like that, do you?

07:23.317 --> 07:25.820
I can't hear you, Dennis. I can't hear you.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.071
Fine.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.916
Now if you're interested in
some really good glassware,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.837
it's cheap, but it's an antique.
Some of those bottles up there

07:42.920 --> 07:45.756
are dated before the Civil War.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.843
And over there,
I used to have in that empty space,

07:48.926 --> 07:53.139
I used to have some of the prettiest
Shirley Temple bottles I've ever seen.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.392
And this woman came in here
with the palsy, the poor soul.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.644
She thought they were so cute,
and she reached for them

07:58.728 --> 08:02.106
and knocked them every one down
and broke them all to damn pieces.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.150
So I took her in the back
and gave her some Coke

08:04.233 --> 08:06.777
and some ammonia.
I thought she was gonna have a spell.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.030
We should get something
for your mom here to say thanks.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.033
- How about some fox piss?
- Yeah. My mom would love fox piss.

08:12.116 --> 08:15.953
Lord, don't drop that. I'll tell you why.
If you do, that's powerful stuff.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.956
All the foxes in this community
will come down here.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.959
You'll have friends
you've never had before.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.503
Y'all here for a vacation?

08:23.586 --> 08:26.297
Yeah. Yeah, we're renting a cabin
for about a week.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.592
That's nice.
Well, enjoy your little slice of heaven.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.304
And if you go in the woods, be very careful.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.181
Why? What's in the woods?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.808
Hey, Tommy, get those kids
their sandwiches back there.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.477
They're all wrapped up.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.645
So what's the fox urine for?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.648
That's for fox season.

08:43.731 --> 08:47.360
- What's the rifle for?
- That's for niggers.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.823
Okay, let's see.
Let me figure those sandwiches.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.576
Now I think we're about ready
to get y'all out of here.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.120
- That's $56 even.
- Okay.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.500
- Anything else I can do for you, friend?
- No. No, I think that's...

09:02.583 --> 09:06.003
Thank you. Y'all have a good vacation, now.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.881
- You, too.
- Come back and see me.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.802
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
You have a nice day, all right?

09:12.885 --> 09:13.928
Okay.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.223
That guy just say "nigger"?

09:17.306 --> 09:20.184
Yeah, Jeff. Don't repeat it.
Call it the "n" word.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.021
Hey.

09:25.898 --> 09:30.653
Boy, you want to give me one good reason
why you would steal a Snickers bar?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.447
The nougat?

09:38.494 --> 09:42.206
- I'm sorry, man. My bad.
- All right. Enjoy.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.625
Thanks.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.172
What?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.300
Moron.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.386
What's wrong with you, dude?

09:55.469 --> 09:56.929
Sorry!

09:57.013 --> 10:00.975
Burn his fucking store down,
the racist mother...

10:07.690 --> 10:08.858
- Here?
- Take a left.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.360
Where else am I gonna go?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.362
Coming down...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.698
- Stop the car! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Careful, Jeff.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.617
- Bert...
- I left my mom's apple juice

10:17.700 --> 10:19.910
-back at the... Back at the store!
- Oh, my God.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.204
- Come on!
- No. We're not going back.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.625
- Come on!
- Hey, Karen, this river is in the map, right?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
Yes, I'm looking at it...

10:27.418 --> 10:29.962
There's no way that this creek
is on the map!

10:30.046 --> 10:32.173
It is on the map.
Do you want to look at the map?

10:32.256 --> 10:33.924
Right there.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.927
Right here next to Big Bone Lick?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.471
- No. Let's see that. Yes.
- Wait, finish it.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.597
She's right. She's right. She's right.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.973
- Yeah. Thank you.
- We're going the right way.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.099
No, no, no. This is not that road, though.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.476
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not, no. We're going back.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.603
- No, no.
- This map's for Cincinnati!

10:45.686 --> 10:48.606
- Shut up!
- Go straight!

10:48.689 --> 10:50.191
It's not... Fine.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.360
Fuck it! We'll go this way.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.852
Oh, my gosh!

11:29.063 --> 11:30.564
This is great.

11:31.065 --> 11:36.237
"Welcome, y'all. Enjoy your vacation from
all of us at Bunyon Mountain Getaways."

11:36.320 --> 11:39.990
Oh, my God, Jeff, check it out. It's so cute.

11:40.074 --> 11:43.494
- This little room and this little bed...
- Yeah.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.996
-...and this view, it's so beautiful.
- Beautiful bed.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.165
- A view of the shrubs...
- Yeah.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.502
...and the bush, and the antlers...

11:51.585 --> 11:53.671
It's gonna be so perfect.
We're here for a week,

11:53.754 --> 11:55.214
and there's no one to bother us.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.049
Who's up for a dip?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.345
We're... They're...

12:02.388 --> 12:04.974
Yeah. Safe sex.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.435
- Hey, Paul?
- Yeah?

12:08.018 --> 12:09.270
Have fun.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.908
That's the second time they've done that.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.871
I think it's kind of sweet, you know?
Seem pretty in love.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.707
Bert, what the hell is that?

12:31.250 --> 12:35.504
- Gonna go shoot some squirrels.
- Why would you want to kill squirrels?

12:35.963 --> 12:38.674
-'Cause they're gay.
- Bert, don't be a fucking retard.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.469
Kidding. I don't care if they're gay
or straight. I'll kill them either way.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.678
Will you be careful with that thing?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.973
Would you relax, man?
It's just a fucking BB gun. Relax!

12:48.392 --> 12:49.477
Sorry.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.940
So, Karen,
how long have we known each other?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.611
- Seventh grade, right?
- Yeah.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.948
So, you know, I was thinking,
we've known each other for so long,

13:03.032 --> 13:05.659
and even though we've...

13:07.995 --> 13:09.413
That's hot!

13:10.206 --> 13:14.251
And even though,
like, we've always been good friends,

13:14.335 --> 13:16.587
we never actually...

13:16.670 --> 13:19.548
Like, I've always thought
that you were really cool and...

13:19.632 --> 13:22.593
Hey. Race you to the raft.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.824
Fuck!

13:44.907 --> 13:46.784
- Fucking good, Jeff.
- Oh, my God!

13:46.867 --> 13:49.829
- I'm so lucky.
- Baby! You're so fucking great!

13:55.626 --> 13:58.087
You're fucking ripped!

13:58.170 --> 14:01.340
You're fucking bod's so fucking...

14:01.882 --> 14:04.552
- Okay, let me do it to you. Fuck it.
- Come on.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.720
You like this? Yeah, yeah?

14:09.723 --> 14:12.476
- You like that? I thought you'd go for that.
- Yeah!

14:13.394 --> 14:15.646
<i>I'm sorry. Yeah!</i>

14:22.570 --> 14:24.405
So, you know Ken Webb?

14:25.739 --> 14:28.826
Yeah. Short, greasy Ken?

14:29.743 --> 14:33.247
- The guy with the CDs, right?
- Yeah.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.083
He tried to kiss me.

14:37.126 --> 14:40.713
- He did?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.967
This guy I've known for, like, 12 years,
this family friend,

14:45.426 --> 14:51.432
puts his hands on my face, full-on tongue.
God, it was so gross.

14:54.935 --> 14:58.606
Why? Was it gross
because you've known him for so long,

14:58.689 --> 15:00.566
or because he's gross?

15:00.941 --> 15:03.152
No, it was definitely him.

15:05.279 --> 15:09.074
I don't know. You know,
when you've known someone a long time

15:09.783 --> 15:14.496
and you just want to kiss them
just to see if they're a good kisser or not?

15:16.290 --> 15:19.001
There's nothing wrong with that, right?

15:20.669 --> 15:21.712
No.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.778
- Where you going?
- What's it look like?

15:47.279 --> 15:49.949
But I thought we were kissing.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.825
Yeah, we were.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.286
So...

15:56.205 --> 15:59.792
So, what, you like me now?
Is this, like, a date?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.585
Don't be gay.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.576
Come back, Mr. Woodchuck.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.414
I'm gonna get you now.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.674
Shit.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.010
Fuck.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.932
I'm so sorry, man!

17:01.228 --> 17:05.190
Why... Why did you shoot me?

17:05.273 --> 17:09.987
I thought you were something else.
I... I... I... Fuck!

17:10.069 --> 17:13.198
- Are you all right?
- I'm sick.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.242
I need help.

17:16.452 --> 17:20.705
I'll get you some help, all right?
I'll be right back. I got a car.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.875
Holy fuck.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.626
- Please...
- Fuck.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.836
- Help me!
- Fuck.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.546
I'm sick. I need water.

17:27.628 --> 17:29.757
I'll... Just, just lay down. Don't move, man.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.508
- Water.
- I'll get you water.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.678
Just stay right...
Don't... Don't come near me, okay?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.138
- Is that your cabin?
- Just stay there, man!

17:36.221 --> 17:37.514
Is that your cabin?

17:37.598 --> 17:40.809
- No! Just stay there. Please stay there!
- I need to rest.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.978
- Don't make me fucking shoot you, man!
- I'm...

17:43.062 --> 17:45.439
Just stay the fuck back, please!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.316
Fuck!

17:49.735 --> 17:51.195
Fuck!

17:55.115 --> 17:58.786
Fuck, man! God! Do here.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.707
Yo, dipshit, what the fuck, man?
Where were you?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.125
You burn the whole fucking place down?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.919
What are you,
fucking Smokey the Clown now?

18:07.002 --> 18:08.587
Don't you mean Smokey the Bear?

18:09.296 --> 18:11.548
Whatever. This is fucking horseshit, man.
It's a fucking fireplace.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.344
How fucking old are you?
Can't you be responsible for anything?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.804
Goddamn, we can't leave you alone

18:16.887 --> 18:19.098
for five fucking minutes
without you destroying something.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.933
- Come on.
- And what the fuck were you shooting at?

18:21.016 --> 18:22.893
I heard a... I heard a squirrel or something...

18:22.976 --> 18:25.187
- I was just looking for a squirrel.
- A squirrel?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.481
- Yeah.
- You're such a fucking idiot.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.149
...a stick up his ass.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.240
- I mean, come on...
- You...

18:36.323 --> 18:39.743
- Paul, why don't you tell us the story?
- No.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.246
And what are you gonna roast
on that thing?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.872
Come on, Paul. Tell them the story.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.791
No, I can't. It's a traumatic experience.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.669
- I don't really want to talk about it.
- I like traumatic stories.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.337
I mean, not about me, but...

18:50.420 --> 18:53.048
Paul, trauma bonds people. You can tell us.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.260
Trauma bonds the people who go through
it, not the people you tell it to.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.972
- Just tell them the fucking story, man!
- All right, all right!

19:00.055 --> 19:02.683
So there's this bowling alley
when we were growing up.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.894
You guys might remember it.
Lenny Mead's Brighton Bowl.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.396
It was in Brighton, right?

19:07.479 --> 19:10.065
That's probably why it was called
the Brighton Bowl. Yeah.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.443
Anyway, we used to go there
for birthday parties

19:13.527 --> 19:16.113
or with my dad for the weekend
or whatever.

19:16.196 --> 19:19.700
And this one time,
I ask my dad if we could go,

19:19.783 --> 19:23.328
and he's like,
"No. The bowling alley's closed."

19:23.704 --> 19:25.914
This marshmallows so burnt!

19:28.542 --> 19:33.589
It turned out there had been a break-in.
All the employees were held at gunpoint.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.301
And then after they had been gagged
and beaten,

19:37.384 --> 19:39.887
they were tied to chairs.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.643
<i>The chairs, they were set in a circle,</i>

19:46.727 --> 19:50.606
<i>so that way everybody was forced to watch
everybody else.</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:56.904
And then the robber, this sick maniac,

19:57.237 --> 20:00.741
he goes and finds
one of those little ball-peen hammers,

20:01.200 --> 20:03.076
and then one by one,

20:03.702 --> 20:07.080
<i>he smashed the backs
of their heads open with the hammer.</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:11.752
<i>Everyone had to watch their friends die,
knowing that they'd soon be next.</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:14.755
Ball-peen.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.342
Guy doesn't stop there.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.178
He goes and he breaks out the fire axe.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.306
The alarm goes off. He doesn't give a shit.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.226
He hacked off all their limbs.

20:28.518 --> 20:32.356
The cops found six bloody torsos
tied to the bowling seats.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.651
Blood everywhere.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.322
Turns out
the guy was some disgruntled employee.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.617
That was my childhood playground.

20:46.078 --> 20:50.290
- Bert, you asshole. It's not funny.
- Yes, it is, you fucking slut.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.417
- Jeff.
- What?

20:53.460 --> 20:57.047
- Tell them about the happy bald guy.
- God, no. I can't take it.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.842
He was the... He was the guy who gave us
our shoes and quarters for the video games.

21:00.926 --> 21:04.596
There was a room with a pool table, too,
but my dad wouldn't let us go back there.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.976
But the bald guy, he was always happy.
He was always smiling, you know.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.770
But the killer got him, too.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.898
When the cops searched the place,
they found all the hacked-off limbs

21:14.982 --> 21:17.234
at the end of the bowling lanes.

21:17.317 --> 21:21.989
The guy had bowled people's organs.
Arms, legs, everything.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.451
Found the bald guy's head
in the ball return.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.665
- He was still smiling.
- Oh, no!

21:31.832 --> 21:33.917
- You! I knew you were full of shit!
- No.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.961
- You suck! You suck!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I swear!

21:36.044 --> 21:38.672
It was in the paper. I swear to...

21:39.172 --> 21:40.507
- I'm laughing because...
- Guys.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.844
Jeff is an asshole
and he's making me laugh.

21:44.094 --> 21:48.265
No, I swear... I loved this place.
I still remember all the sounds,

21:48.348 --> 21:51.059
you know, like the cracking, the bouncing,

21:51.143 --> 21:53.603
the smell of the shoes,
the sounds of the Q-bert machine...

21:53.687 --> 21:56.106
Holy shit! What are you doing, man?

21:56.189 --> 21:58.317
- I'm cool, I'm cool!
- Are you spying on us or something, man?

21:58.400 --> 22:00.694
- I'm cool.
- Wait. ls your dog friendly?

22:00.777 --> 22:04.573
Yeah, yeah. He's cool. This is Dr. Mambo.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.992
Here, boy. Come on. Come on, Dr. Mambo.

22:07.075 --> 22:09.870
He's a doctor?
Like a physician or a professor?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.539
Yeah, he's a professor.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.959
Of being a dog! Faced!

22:19.963 --> 22:21.465
Scratch-mod ed !

22:30.390 --> 22:32.517
That's a positive bonfire.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.020
Got room for one more?

22:38.398 --> 22:42.069
Actually, we were kind of having
a private conversation, if you don't mind.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.364
That's cool, that's cool.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.991
I guess I'll go smoke
all this weed by myself then.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.034
- No, no, no. That's cool.
- No, no.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.660
- It's fine!
- That's all right. It's not that private.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.787
- Yeah.
- It's fine.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.623
- So... Yeah, so, you know...
- Awesome.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.878
- Yeah, sit right here.
- Awesome. Awesome.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.714
Awesome.

23:03.256 --> 23:07.135
- Wait. So your name was...
- Justin. But you can call me Grim.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.429
- Grim.
- Like "Grimace"?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.224
Grim is my skating name.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.143
I got it out in Berkeley
when I was competing in the X-games.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.938
- Really? Karen's gonna go to Berkeley.
- Yeah.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.690
Dude!

23:20.774 --> 23:22.025
Awesome!

23:22.109 --> 23:25.529
Yeah. Love Berkeley. I mean,
people there are so whacked, you know.

23:25.612 --> 23:29.241
I met these guys, and they had me
fucked up for, like, five days straight.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.451
They wouldn't let me
drink anything but beer.

23:31.535 --> 23:35.038
Yeah. Yeah, I've totally done that,
except I do it with J.D.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.498
Hey, Karen's got a great idea.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.792
We should only drink beer
for the rest of the trip.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.212
I could probably do that, Bert,
but I doubt that you could.

23:42.295 --> 23:46.091
All right. I'll bet you I can only drink beer
for the rest of the trip, okay?

23:46.174 --> 23:48.552
If I drink anything else,
you can have the rest of my supply.

23:48.969 --> 23:52.764
- All right, you're on. We only drink beer.
- Yeah, you're on.

23:52.848 --> 23:56.601
So... So what? You're like a skater?
Is that your occupation?

23:58.645 --> 24:01.273
- Crap!
- Party's over.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.399
No.

24:03.483 --> 24:07.446
Hey, Justin... Grim,
you want to come inside for a little bit?

24:08.071 --> 24:10.866
You know what? I'd love to,
but I left all the shit outside my tent,

24:10.949 --> 24:14.911
and it's starting to rain. If it gets fucked up,
it's, like, $4,000 worth of shit pissed away.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.204
Wait. How far is your tent?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.957
It's 20 minutes away, but, you know,
if I book, I can be back in, like, 30.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.792
All right, cool. Bring the weed.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.587
I will. All right, cool. Check you dudes later.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.380
Come on, Dr. Mambo.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.677
- Freak.
- I thought he was funny.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.477
- How'd it work?
- What do you mean, how?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.813
It had a hose, bunch of different settings.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.399
Pulse. Power.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.735
Stream.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.738
And you came every time?

24:50.697 --> 24:51.907
Totally.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.494
You can imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.788
- Tell me about it.
- Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

24:58.872 --> 25:00.624
I got a better story than that.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.542
I'm sorry, Bert, but no story is better

25:02.626 --> 25:04.794
than Karen and her parents'
shower massage.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.047
No, seriously, I'm serious.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.841
One time I was masturbating,

25:10.884 --> 25:13.220
and my dog came up
and started licking my balls,

25:13.303 --> 25:16.681
then right as I came,
it stuck its tongue up my ass.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.227
That's fucking serious
masturbation talent right there.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.145
Fucking good.

25:24.147 --> 25:27.484
The guy better have brought more weed
or I'm not letting him in.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.946
- All right, relax, pal, I'm coming.
- His name's Grim.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.992
Jesus Christ.

25:40.705 --> 25:45.710
Help me. Please, I need a doctor.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.798
Doctor.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.511
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right. Yeah, hey,
somebody grab a blanket or something.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.850
You...

26:04.771 --> 26:06.189
You shot me.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.609
No, no, no, no, no. There's no way

26:09.693 --> 26:11.486
this fucking contagious fucker's
coming in here.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.780
- Bert, he's sick, for Christ's sake.
- No, fuck him!

26:13.863 --> 26:16.533
What, you want him to come in here
and fucking touch all your shit?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.034
Your fucking soap, your fucking...

26:18.118 --> 26:19.869
Wait! Let's throw him a blanket
or something.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.205
- Your douche or some shit?
- We could at least drive him to a doctor!

26:22.289 --> 26:23.999
No! He's not fucking coming in here!

26:24.082 --> 26:27.002
We're out of range.
I'm not getting anything.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.129
- Fuck.
- What's that?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.339
- He's in the car.
- What?

26:33.466 --> 26:36.511
- Motherfucker!
- Why is this guy fucking with us?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.430
- Grab your gun.
- Fuck.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.473
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
He's in the car already.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.142
- Let's go!
- Come on! Come on!

26:45.687 --> 26:49.524
Get out of the car, man! Out!
No fucking more!

26:49.983 --> 26:55.030
Get out of there! Get out of the car, man!
Get out! Get out of the fucking car!

26:55.113 --> 26:57.240
- Look out!
- Fuck!

26:57.324 --> 26:59.576
Get out of the truck, you freak!
Get out of there, man!

26:59.659 --> 27:02.871
- Fuck, motherfucker!
- You shot the car!

27:02.954 --> 27:04.080
What am I supposed to do?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.416
Oh, my God, man!

27:10.545 --> 27:13.381
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck!

27:15.884 --> 27:17.010
Shit!

27:21.681 --> 27:23.391
- Come back, man!
- Shit!

27:26.895 --> 27:29.356
- Stab him!
- He's coming towards us!

27:30.315 --> 27:35.654
Stop or I'll fucking stab you!
Stop! Stop! God!

27:38.490 --> 27:43.787
All right, back off! Fuck off!
Come on, leave us alone! Fuck off!

27:45.872 --> 27:46.956
No!

27:57.300 --> 28:00.845
I know, I know, I know.
What else were we gonna do?

28:01.930 --> 28:05.725
First he gets his shit all over the car,
then, I didn't want him touching me.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.477
Or you or anybody.

28:08.144 --> 28:11.481
- I think the rain will put him out.
- Well, listen, he's dead anyway.

28:11.564 --> 28:16.194
I mean, you guys saw that shit on him.
He looked like he was skinned alive.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.864
We have to tell the police
it wasn't our fault.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.658
I think we should tell them now.

28:21.741 --> 28:24.202
- I think we should tell them now.
- Would you just calm down?

28:24.285 --> 28:27.080
There's nothing we can do.
The car's fucked.

28:27.163 --> 28:31.334
We need a mechanic. We'll find a neighbor,
we'll find somebody who knows one.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.586
And then we'll report the accident.

28:33.670 --> 28:37.257
That's the key word here.
It was an accident, all right?

28:39.217 --> 28:42.971
That guy's skin... Holy shit.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.910
You know, you should probably clean up
some of this shit while we're gone, man.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.578
Yeah, I'll be sure
and save some for you guys.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.456
- Look, just stick with the girls, all right?
- What's that supposed to mean?

29:51.539 --> 29:54.167
It means you're a fucking pussy.
What do you think?

29:54.250 --> 29:55.835
- That's fucked up.
- No, what's fucked up

29:55.919 --> 29:58.254
is you beating the shit out of my truck
with that bat of yours.

29:58.338 --> 30:01.174
What about the jag-off over here
with the rifle? Did you forget about him?

30:01.257 --> 30:04.427
Come on, man! We all fucked up that car.
Don't just put it on me.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.806
Morning, boys.
You guys gonna kill each other now?

30:09.516 --> 30:12.060
- Where you going?
- To get help.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.731
- So, Bert and Jeff have gone to...
- I know.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.359
Karen...

31:04.529 --> 31:07.657
Look, last night was
a really fucked-up situation, and I think...

31:07.740 --> 31:11.661
Paul, that guy asked for our help.
We lit him on fire.

31:13.454 --> 31:17.208
You'll understand if I'm not
in a particularly social mood.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.922
I got scared. You know, I was...

31:24.048 --> 31:26.092
I was just trying to help.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.055
Karen.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.976
I'm sorry, Paul.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.273
Every time I close my eyes, I see him.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.734
It was an accident.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.945
The guy was gonna die anyway.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.792
Better?

32:02.629 --> 32:03.755
Yeah.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.969
Thanks, Paul.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.821
Hello!

33:07.026 --> 33:09.946
God damn it! God damn it!
God damn it! God damn it!

33:10.029 --> 33:11.739
Damn it! Damn it!

33:11.823 --> 33:14.742
God damn it! God damn it! God damn it!

33:17.245 --> 33:22.291
Hold it! You there! Do you see this?
Do you see this shit?

33:22.375 --> 33:26.254
- No, no, we didn't see anything.
- You tell Murray I can't eat this shit.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.716
Some goddamn animal's been running
around here infecting everything.

33:29.799 --> 33:32.635
And what am I supposed to do
with a sick hog, huh? Huh?

33:32.719 --> 33:35.471
Because I am not about to eat that meat.
Would you?

33:35.555 --> 33:37.473
No, I'm a vegetarian...

33:37.557 --> 33:39.642
Because, you know,
none of this shit's good.

33:39.726 --> 33:43.980
It's all sick. It's all gotta go back,
and I want me a new hog!

33:44.063 --> 33:46.691
You know what?
We were just looking for a mechanic, so...

33:46.774 --> 33:49.318
A mechanic?
Well, you won't find one around here.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.904
- You'll have to go to town to get that.
- See, that's the thing.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.449
Our car's busted, right?
So we can't get into town,

33:54.532 --> 33:56.576
so we need to find somebody
that'll take us into town, you know,

33:56.659 --> 33:58.745
so we can find a mechanic.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.081
Well, I already been in town today. Sorry.

34:02.165 --> 34:06.169
All right, well, if you do go back,
would you tell us?

34:06.252 --> 34:11.674
Because, see, we're staying in a cabin,
and we don't know Murray.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.972
I'm sorry. Yes, of course, of course!

34:18.181 --> 34:20.850
Heck, why didn't y'all just
come out and say that?

34:20.933 --> 34:23.686
Well, come on inside.
I've got a radio. We'll call Ricky.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.021
- A radio?
- He's got a tow truck. Yeah.

34:25.103 --> 34:27.106
- We'll call Ricky.
- Ricky, all right.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.859
Sorry to bother you, but this crazy guy
came out of the woods,

34:29.942 --> 34:32.862
and he tried to trash our car or something.
I don't know.

34:32.945 --> 34:38.367
Sounds terrible. I have some juice.
So this person damaged your car?

34:38.576 --> 34:41.411
Yeah, it was just this crazy hermit.
You know, real dangerous.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.748
We had to chase him away
with bats and everything.

34:43.831 --> 34:47.502
A hermit? It wasn't Henry, was it?
Nah, shit, never.

34:53.049 --> 34:55.467
- Henry?
- No, my cousin, Henry.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.554
But he knows about that ordinance.
He wouldn't do something like that.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.390
- Did you say you hit him with a bat?
- No!

35:02.141 --> 35:04.143
- No, no, it wasn't Henry.
- No.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.855
It was our friend, Walter. He got drunk,
and, you know, one thing led to another.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.816
- No, that's no good.
- Yeah.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.320
Hey! You know what? I got a great idea.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.239
- Why don't we take a walk down ourselves?
- Yeah.

35:16.322 --> 35:18.407
- It's really nice out.
- It's... We'll just walk.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.243
I haven't really gotten
to see the scenery or anything.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.620
Are you sure?
I mean, Ricky's awfully handy.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.330
- You know, thanks a lot for your help.
- Are you sure?

35:24.413 --> 35:28.417
Yeah, a little fresh air sounds great.
So we really appreciate your help.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.502
Take care.

35:31.754 --> 35:34.465
- I can't believe we burned Henry!
- Fuck!

36:24.223 --> 36:25.391
Hello?

36:31.272 --> 36:32.440
Hello?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.461
Hello?

37:04.305 --> 37:05.473
Hello?

37:08.434 --> 37:09.602
Hello?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.939
Is anyone home?

37:23.658 --> 37:24.825
Hello?

37:26.994 --> 37:29.288
- Bert, you dick-nose!
- Shut up!

37:31.415 --> 37:33.251
- What the hell?
- Did you find anybody?

37:33.334 --> 37:34.460
No, nothing.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.337
Well, I followed the path
that that old guy ran,

37:36.420 --> 37:39.548
but I don't know. I couldn't find him.
He could still be alive.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.384
No, it's impossible.

37:43.469 --> 37:46.222
- You guys want any beef jerky?
- No, Bert. Put it away.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.641
- Why?
-'Cause it's not our house.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.767
So?

37:52.353 --> 37:54.146
- Did you find a phone?
- No.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.565
No. It felt weird looking around,
but there's nobody here.

37:56.649 --> 38:00.319
We found this other place,
but there's nobody there either.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.990
- I wonder if the cops know about it yet.
- I doubt it.

38:04.073 --> 38:07.410
I mean, if they did know, they probably
would've been at the cabin by now.

38:18.713 --> 38:22.758
Morning, son. Deputy Winston.
Bunyon County Sheriff's department.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.178
Hi. Hi, what can I do for you?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.347
I'm out patrolling myjurisdiction,

38:28.431 --> 38:30.933
and I heard there was
a lot of commotion here last night.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.687
- I just want to know what the story is.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

38:34.854 --> 38:38.941
Some guy tried to break into our cabin,
and he was sick.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.862
I don't know what kind of disease he had,
but he was a mess.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.741
- Okay. Well, I'm gonna have to report this.
- Yeah. No, totally.

38:46.824 --> 38:50.911
My friends are out looking for a neighbor
right now so we could actually call you.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.788
We don't have a phone in here.

38:52.872 --> 38:56.709
Yeah. That's because everyone uses radios.
That's what I use.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.379
Hey.

39:01.547 --> 39:05.343
Looks like you guys were doing
some pretty good partying, huh, man?

39:05.426 --> 39:07.970
Well, yeah. You know, we were drinking.

39:08.054 --> 39:12.224
And then this guy came along,
and he tried to break into the cabin.

39:12.391 --> 39:17.772
We had no choice but to get rough.
I mean, I feel awful, but he was going crazy.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.733
He smashed into our car,
and then he wouldn't come out,

39:20.816 --> 39:23.402
so, we had to hit him.

39:24.236 --> 39:28.699
I mean, we hurt him, but we were terrified.
We didn't know what to do.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.659
That's why we went to look for help today...

39:30.743 --> 39:34.372
Hey, man, I told you.
All right, I'm gonna make a report.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.166
Don't worry about it.
He ain't gonna come back, man.

39:37.249 --> 39:39.710
Looks like you guys
scared him away pretty good.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.713
I ain't gonna let him ruin your fun, all right?

39:42.797 --> 39:45.508
Thank you. 'Cause I'll tell you,
my friend's inside right now,

39:45.591 --> 39:49.553
and she's pretty freaked out.
She wants to go home.

39:50.262 --> 39:53.599
- We all kind of do.
- You've got a lady friend, huh?

39:54.975 --> 39:58.270
Yeah, I bet you like to party with the ladies.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.192
Paul?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.903
Is everything okay?

40:06.695 --> 40:08.823
Howdy, ma'am! Everything's fine.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.952
Just go back inside,
have yourself a big 40, just party.

40:15.287 --> 40:16.455
Okay.

40:22.628 --> 40:25.297
Daddy, man!
Why you talking about leaving for?

40:25.381 --> 40:29.802
- You gotta stay and party.
- That's why we came here in the first place.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.722
I'm telling you, man.
This is a major party town.

40:33.806 --> 40:34.890
Really?

40:34.974 --> 40:37.435
You kidding me, man?
You know what it's like.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.688
Like when you go to a new town, right,
and you're the new guy.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.149
All the girls see you
walking down the street.

40:43.232 --> 40:46.527
They all know you got
five pounds of dangling meat.

40:46.986 --> 40:50.990
You're looking for no commitment.
You understand what I'm saying?

40:51.282 --> 40:54.952
- Yeah, yeah, I've heard that phrase before.
- Shit, man, this is that town.

40:55.035 --> 40:59.373
It's like when I go party up in Wambusa
'cause my cousin goes to school there.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.210
So when I party in Wambusa,
I know I'm gonna get pussy, man.

41:03.502 --> 41:05.463
Plus, you know, the girls up there,
they don't know I'm a deputy.

41:05.546 --> 41:09.341
You know, they don't know what I do,
so I know they're gonna party hard with me.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.677
And believe me, man, they do.

41:12.928 --> 41:16.390
That's too bad. I bet you used to
rule this town before you had a badge.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.935
Yeah, but, you know,
the badge make you grow up quick.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.690
Holy shit, man. Those guys
really did a number on your ride.

41:24.773 --> 41:27.109
And I'm gonna put out an A.P.B.
We gonna catch this guy, all right?

41:27.193 --> 41:30.988
Yeah. You know, it wasn't totally him.
We hit it, too.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.533
But we were just trying to
scare him away, you know?

41:34.658 --> 41:37.411
Do you think you can get somebody
up here to fix it?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.246
What do I look like, man, an idiot?

41:39.330 --> 41:42.041
I'll have somebody up here
by tomorrow afternoon, all right?

41:42.124 --> 41:45.002
You're top priority. You're the party man!

41:45.503 --> 41:49.048
Do you realize how many great parties
we're gonna have?

41:49.340 --> 41:53.469
Fortune's shining on you, brother.
I know where all the big parties are at.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.679
Listen, just remember
my name's Winston, all right?

41:55.763 --> 41:58.265
You know how to get a hold of me, right?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.392
-911?
- That's it, my man.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.230
- Take it easy, all right?
- Yeah.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.795
Did he say he was gonna
report this shit or not?

42:27.878 --> 42:31.257
I think he is, but, you know, he didn't
make it seem like we did anything wrong.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.801
He just said he'd get a tow truck
up here by tomorrow.

42:33.884 --> 42:36.095
- Sounds weird to me.
- The guy was weird.

42:36.178 --> 42:39.139
Once he saw Karen, he didn't want to leave.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.934
Has Karen left her room yet?

42:42.935 --> 42:46.313
No, she's still sleeping.
I don't know what's up with her.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.525
She wants to get out of here
as soon as she can.

42:49.608 --> 42:52.903
- Kind of puts a kink in your plan, huh?
- What plan?

42:53.779 --> 42:55.155
What plan!

42:55.531 --> 42:59.577
The plan you've been trying to execute
since, what, eighth grade?

42:59.994 --> 43:02.454
No, there's no plan. Not anymore.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.791
Whatever. You guys are funny.

43:06.417 --> 43:10.004
Fucking... She likes you
because you're nice to her,

43:10.087 --> 43:14.592
and she's nice to you
because she can control you, and fuck it...

43:14.675 --> 43:18.178
- You're nice to her because...
- Bert, Bert, don't move.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.269
Fuck. It's that fucking freak's dog, man.

43:26.812 --> 43:29.565
- Should I hit it?
- I don't know, man.

43:30.482 --> 43:33.068
If you're gonna hit it, hit it hard.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.453
Holy shit.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.290
So where's Grim?

43:46.498 --> 43:48.375
I'll tell you where he is.
He's out there rotting.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.752
There's some sick shit out in that woods,

43:49.835 --> 43:52.838
and that fucking hermit's
spreading it around.

43:53.130 --> 43:54.465
I'm not gonna wait
for that deputy to come back.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.676
- I say we get out of here right now.
- Should we say something on our way out,

43:57.760 --> 44:00.220
like, "By the way,
we burned some guy alive"?

44:00.304 --> 44:01.305
- Yes.
- No.

44:01.388 --> 44:04.099
- Jeff...
- Fine. Fuck it. We'll tell the cops.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.435
We have to.
Look, they're gonna figure it out.

44:06.518 --> 44:09.188
The deputy knows something happened.
We're the only outsiders.

44:09.271 --> 44:11.732
They're gonna trace it back to us.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.361
I feel nauseous.

44:16.695 --> 44:17.905
Karen...

44:19.823 --> 44:23.619
- How soon can you get us out of here?
- I don't know if I can fix the car.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.830
I'm thinking I could make it drivable,
maybe, you know?

44:26.914 --> 44:30.793
And then we could drive into town
and tell them what happened.

44:30.876 --> 44:33.003
And that'll be that, right?

44:35.005 --> 44:36.757
Look, you're gonna have to watch me
with the gun, man.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.386
I'm not gonna go out there
with that fucking dog around.

44:41.053 --> 44:44.890
I need a bath.
Jeff's mom has the stupidest ideas.

44:44.973 --> 44:47.059
"Let's get a cabin." So gay.

45:07.746 --> 45:08.747
Hey.

45:09.498 --> 45:10.499
Hey.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.919
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.088
No, it's okay.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.926
I think Marcy made some chili.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.095
I'm not hungry.

45:27.599 --> 45:30.185
All right, then,
I'll just let you get back to sleep.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.562
No, wait.

45:32.771 --> 45:33.856
Sta)'-

45:45.117 --> 45:46.201
Fuck!

45:48.412 --> 45:50.581
- Why'd you stop?
- Would you fucking shoot him already?

45:50.664 --> 45:51.874
- Come on!
- Don't stop!

45:51.957 --> 45:53.751
- Just keep working!
- No! Shoot it!

45:53.834 --> 45:56.420
If it gets any closer, I can hit it.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.881
- Fuck.
- Just keep working!

48:04.756 --> 48:05.966
My God!

48:08.760 --> 48:09.845
Shit!

48:14.850 --> 48:15.934
Marcy!

48:16.768 --> 48:17.936
No!

48:19.521 --> 48:24.234
- She's got it! She's sick!
- Oh, no, she's fucking got it. Shit.

48:24.318 --> 48:28.614
- Guys, I think I'm really sick.
- Shit. Stay in your fucking bed, okay!

48:28.864 --> 48:31.283
- Bert, can you help me?
- Bert, calm down.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.952
- Let's just...
- No! Go! Get the fuck out! Everybody out!

48:34.036 --> 48:35.829
- Okay!
- Just get the fuck out, okay!

48:35.913 --> 48:38.790
- Bert, please...
- Stay in your fucking bed!

48:39.166 --> 48:41.209
- I'm bleeding!
- Get the fuck out! Just get out!

48:41.293 --> 48:43.670
- Calm down!
- Can I go to the bathroom, please?

48:43.754 --> 48:44.755
Listen, you fucking bitch,

48:44.838 --> 48:46.798
-get the fuck back!
- Leave her alone!

48:46.882 --> 48:50.302
- What?
- Come on! Leave her alone! God damn it!

48:50.677 --> 48:53.347
- What the fuck is your problem?
- She's your fucking friend, man!

48:53.430 --> 48:56.350
She's fucking sick!
She's not coming near me, okay?

48:56.433 --> 48:58.769
I'm fucking doing this for you!
I'm doing it for all you fucks!

48:58.852 --> 49:01.229
- Don't leave me!
- Hey, you fucking whore,

49:01.313 --> 49:04.441
the headlights are busted on the car.
We can't go anywhere.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.276
- Ben!
- Goddamn whore!

49:07.819 --> 49:09.905
'Rm just trying to help!
- Bert! BETH

49:09.988 --> 49:12.908
- Calm down. Calm down.
- God! Okay.

49:17.829 --> 49:18.914
What?

51:00.098 --> 51:01.600
Fuck you guys.

51:02.142 --> 51:04.686
Karen, I'm sorry. We just don't wanna get it.

51:04.770 --> 51:07.481
- I'm gonna die in here.
- No, you're not.

51:07.731 --> 51:11.651
- Karen, please. We're going to get help now.
- What about that guy's dog?

51:11.735 --> 51:13.695
Somebody's gonna be watching
with the gun, okay?

51:13.779 --> 51:15.614
Yeah, we're gonna bolt the door shut.

51:15.697 --> 51:17.032
Somebody's gonna be out here
the whole time.

51:17.115 --> 51:19.493
We're not gonna leave you alone.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.829
I wanna go home.

52:05.205 --> 52:06.373
Karen?

52:08.917 --> 52:10.085
Karen.

52:23.682 --> 52:25.976
Come on, Karen. You gotta eat.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.492
Let me know
if you need anything else, okay?

52:43.577 --> 52:44.703
Okay?

52:45.954 --> 52:48.206
Better close the door, Marcy.

52:50.542 --> 52:53.003
You don't want to infect everyone.

53:51.102 --> 53:53.188
- God!
- What are you doing?

53:53.271 --> 53:56.691
- I'm... My friend, she's very sick, and...
- You are very sick!

53:56.775 --> 54:00.570
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry! No, I'm...
- That's my wife in there!

54:01.571 --> 54:04.366
My friend's dying. We need a phone, please.

54:04.449 --> 54:06.868
- Get the fuck off my property!
- Shit! Okay!

54:06.952 --> 54:08.119
Git!

54:15.085 --> 54:18.630
Where have you been?
Did you find anyone?

54:19.297 --> 54:20.340
No.

54:20.465 --> 54:23.426
All right. Come on inside. Marcy made chili.

54:28.473 --> 54:30.058
Nobody's hungry?

54:33.603 --> 54:37.357
- What if Karen used those bowls?
- Jesus, Jeff, I washed them.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.902
He's right. I mean, I'm not gonna eat
until we get back down to town.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.071
You know, any of you guys could have it.

54:43.154 --> 54:45.907
I know we checked,
but I'm not gonna sleep near you guys.

54:45.991 --> 54:48.994
You know, so go sleep in the car, Jeff,
and just give us all a break.

54:49.077 --> 54:52.414
The car? That thing's a germ factory.
I don't even wanna ride in it.

54:52.497 --> 54:54.082
Would you calm down? I cleaned it, okay?

54:54.165 --> 54:58.086
- Yeah, then why don't you go sleep in it?
- Maybe I will, you...

54:58.253 --> 54:59.504
You know what, you're right.

54:59.587 --> 55:02.340
We should probably
prepare our own meals.

55:03.925 --> 55:06.636
Who am I? "I'm melting! I'm burning!"

55:07.554 --> 55:09.222
Bert, what's your fucking problem?

55:09.306 --> 55:10.890
You're gonna burn down
this whole fucking place!

55:11.016 --> 55:12.017
- What?
- You're an asshole!

55:12.100 --> 55:14.519
- You fucking prick! What, bitch?
- Bert, stop it!

55:15.729 --> 55:16.771
- Motherfucker...
- Bert!

55:16.855 --> 55:18.398
Get the fuck off me!

55:19.524 --> 55:21.318
Shut the fuck up!

55:23.028 --> 55:25.947
Christ, I can't take it anymore.

55:29.284 --> 55:32.871
Our friend's dying out there.
She's fucking dying.

55:34.039 --> 55:37.709
And we're in here acting like a bunch
of fucking pussies, so for one second,

55:37.792 --> 55:41.379
let's just forget about helping her,
strap on some balls,

55:41.588 --> 55:45.133
and help each other, because otherwise,
we're all fucking doomed.

55:45.216 --> 55:47.135
- He's right. I was just saying...
- Of course, he's right.

55:47.218 --> 55:48.887
- Marcy. ..
- Good, good!

55:48.970 --> 55:51.848
We're communicating. See? That's positive.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.019
Just no more yelling, okay?

55:56.102 --> 55:59.105
We can eat alone,
we can sleep alone, whatever.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.692
We have to talk to each other.
We have to work together.

56:06.237 --> 56:08.406
Bert, you just lost the bet.

56:13.953 --> 56:15.080
Shit!

56:30.720 --> 56:32.639
Okay, Karen, he's gone.

56:32.931 --> 56:37.060
All right, we're gonna stay out here
all night for you, all right?

56:38.103 --> 56:39.104
Karen?

57:23.231 --> 57:24.899
Fuck. Okay.

57:30.822 --> 57:31.906
Fuck!

57:36.744 --> 57:40.039
Come on, let's go, everybody!
Hurry up! The jeep's running!

57:40.123 --> 57:41.624
Jeff, come on!

57:57.849 --> 58:01.102
- Can you sit up?
- Come on, Karen. We gotta go.

58:03.938 --> 58:06.232
I think I have a fever, sort of.

58:06.357 --> 58:07.609
Let's go)!

59:01.913 --> 59:05.375
Come on, Jeff, let's go!
Come on, motherfucker!

59:08.253 --> 59:12.507
- All right, put her in the back, okay?
- I don't think we should sit next to her.

59:12.590 --> 59:14.968
Fuck off, man. Put her in the front, then.

59:15.051 --> 59:17.220
No, I'm not driving
with her sitting next to me.

59:17.303 --> 59:20.431
I'm driving.
Just get in the fucking car, okay?

59:20.557 --> 59:21.641
Fine.

59:24.727 --> 59:25.937
Karen?

59:27.272 --> 59:28.940
Karen, you okay?

59:31.943 --> 59:33.861
- God, Karen.
- Shit.

59:37.282 --> 59:39.367
We've gotta get her to town.
She's gonna die!

59:39.450 --> 59:41.536
She's not going anywhere.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.413
All right. Come on. You guys coming?

59:43.496 --> 59:46.040
What are you, nuts?
She just infected the car.

59:46.124 --> 59:49.877
- I'll take my chances, man.
- I'm not leaving Karen. I can't.

59:50.336 --> 59:51.963
Bert, you don't look so hot.

59:52.297 --> 59:55.425
I don't feel so hot, either, but, you know,
the longer we sit here and fucking argue,

59:55.508 --> 59:58.636
-the more she lies there and rots!
- How sick are you, Bert?

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.931
- Did that old guy touch you?
- Fucking horseshit, man! Come on!

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.976
- Well, did he or didn't he?
- Fuck this, man.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.439
I'm getting her a fucking doctor!

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:12.108
We should move her back to the shed.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.288
- God, she's bleeding again.
- Don't move her.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:29.167
It's okay, Karen. We're gonna get help.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:37.967
- Going somewhere?
- Anywhere but here.

01:00:42.847 --> 01:00:43.973
Here.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:50.396
Where the fuck do you think
you're going? Jeff!

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.024
- Just let him go.
- Jeff! Jeff!

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:55.568
- Don't fucking come near me! Stop!
- Jeff!

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.988
Stop! I don't wanna get sick!
I don't want any of us getting sick!

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.449
But you two fucking fuckers
insist on touching her.

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:03.326
Now she's bleeding all over
both of you guys.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:07.538
So you two can fucking rot,
but not me, no fucking way! Not me!

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:11.793
Asshole!

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.228
Shit!

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.326
We're all gonna get it.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:50.373
We're all gonna get sick,
and Jeff's in the woods getting drunk.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.042
No.

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:59.882
Bert's gonna get help.
Karen will be fine. I promise.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:06.097
It's like being on a plane
when you know it's gonna crash.

01:02:07.014 --> 01:02:09.934
Everyone around you
is screaming and yelling,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.187
"We're going down, we're going down!"

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:16.441
All you really wanna do is
grab the person next to you

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:19.152
and fuck the shit out of them 'cause

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.905
you know you're gonna be
dead soon anyway.

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:30.997
- You don't use condoms?
- Don't worry. I'm healthy.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:02:59.484
Fuck!

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.685
Hello? Somebody help! Hello?

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.940
What the hell happened to you?

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:43.736
- My friend, she's sick.
- You don't look so good.

01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:48.699
I know. Just... There's this disease.
I think all my friends are getting it.

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:53.120
Do you just know
where a hospital is around or something?

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:56.874
Yeah. Stay right there.
Don't come any closer.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.044
- I'll get a doctor.
- Thanks.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:06.551
- Pancakes! Pancakes!
- No pancakes.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:10.012
- Pancakes!
- No pancakes!

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:21.732
Dennis, Dennis!
I told you to stay on the swing!

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:25.444
Dennis! Dennis!

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:36.205
Fuck!

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.711
God damn it! What pancakes? Fuck!

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.423
- Why'd you come here?
- Listen...

01:04:45.506 --> 01:04:48.718
- Now, look what you done.
- I just need a doctor, okay?

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:53.222
What you done to this poor boy?
What's he done to you?

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:57.018
I just need a fucking doctor, man!

01:04:57.101 --> 01:05:00.980
I already lost one boy. I ain't losing another.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.566
Now, what if the doctors can't fix my boy?

01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:07.069
You get my boy sick,
it's the same as killing him.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.322
- It's murder.
- What?

01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:13.284
You being sick, that's your problem.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:17.038
Now Dennis is sick, that's my problem.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:21.000
And if I get sick, that's Lucille's problem.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.502
So we got to stop the problem.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:27.006
We got to stop the problem right now!

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.633
Fenster! Rifle!

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:31.010
Fuck you, man!

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:41.604
There're some kids in the cabin.
They got a disease.

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:43.814
They just gave it to Dennis.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:46.692
We'll need the kit.

01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:53.658
Jesus, Paul, you really
did a number on my back.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.577
I'm gonna go find Jeff,
and then we're gonna walk out of here.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.745
What about Bert?

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.497
I can't wait for him.
I have to get out of here.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.458
Paul, what about Karen? Paul!

01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:36.993
Oh, my God. Work!

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.413
Fuck! Fuck!

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.623
Fuck.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.713
Fucking piece of fucking shit!

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.066
Where is he?

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.710
Fuck!

01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:17.134
Fuck!

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.497
Shit!

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.072
Up here.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:28.265
No!No!No!

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:02.424
Help me!

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.541
- Bert!
- They're coming for you, man.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.835
- Who? The deputy?
- No, no. The guy.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.838
- The guy from the store.
- Come on.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.776
These kids were trouble
the minute they stole from Cad.

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:27.069
My God.

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:31.031
He's doing sacrifices or something.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.741
It's unchristian.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:05.691
One, two...

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:08.444
Good night, fucker.

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:11.447
Got him.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:56.700
You killed Tommy's boy, you bastard.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.207
You tell them this wasn't our fault.

01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:06.960
That disease.
That was here before we got here.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.505
You tell them!

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.135
Thanks, Bert.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:30.234
Jeff! Jeff, it's the water!

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:33.737
Wherever you are, don't drink the water!

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:55.759
Hello?

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:09.940
Jeff?

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:23.495
Jeff!

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:33.755
Jeff?

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.154
Fuck me.

01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.496
Fuck!

01:18:47.097 --> 01:18:49.057
Here, have a big beer.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.767
Go on. Drink up.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:53.854
You got some sexy hair, you know that?

01:18:53.937 --> 01:18:55.814
You got sexy shoes, too.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:14.750
Shit, what the fuck happened to you, man?

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.169
The tow truck.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.672
What happened to the tow truck, Winston?

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:23.633
Shit, man. The fucking party man.

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:26.428
I'm so fucking sorry
about the tow truck, man.

01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:27.804
I sent it there, it broke down,

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.557
I had to get a tow truck
to get that fucking tow truck.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.434
Man, what do you need.
You need a fucking ride?

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:36.772
Yeah. Yeah, a ride would be good.

01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:38.774
<i>Winston!</i>

01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.984
<i>Shâ€œ.
- Winston, do you copy?</i>

01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:44.070
Yes, sir. I copy. Yeah, I'm still looking
for that underage booze party.

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:46.740
<i>You never mind them.
We got bigger problems.</i>

01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:49.868
<i>Some kids up in a cabin,
they're on a killing spree.</i>

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:52.245
<i>There's two,
possibly three casualties already.</i>

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:54.998
<i>Now, they are armed and hostile.
Do not go anywhere near them.</i>

01:19:55.081 --> 01:19:58.251
<i>They got some kind of a skin virus
that'll eat you alive,</i>

01:19:58.335 --> 01:19:59.669
<i>so if you do see them,</i>

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:02.422
<i>do not hesitate to shoot them on sight.
Do you copy?</i>

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:04.925
Yes, sir.
Can you just repeat that last part, man?

01:20:05.008 --> 01:20:09.095
<i>I said, if you see the kid,
you shoot him on sight.</i>

01:20:16.353 --> 01:20:18.146
So how about that ride, Winston?

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.941
What the fuck, man... You shoot him!

01:20:21.024 --> 01:20:24.152
- Hey, man, I can't.
- But you heard that walkie-talkie, dude.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.987
And the fucking gun's in the car, man.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.280
I just want to get into town.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:28.615
Why don't you just fucking relax
and grab a beer?

01:20:28.698 --> 01:20:29.741
Get away from me, you fucking fruitcake!

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.201
- Hey, back off.
- You're not going anyplace.

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:32.619
Hey, just party. Let's just party.

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:34.454
- Fuck!
- Shit, man.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.376
You can take your shit... Fuck!

01:20:39.459 --> 01:20:40.627
What the...

01:20:40.710 --> 01:20:42.504
Man, come on, be cool! Be cool!

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:43.880
What the fuck!

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:46.842
- Fuck!
- What the fuck!

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:04.818
You fucking idiot!

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:08.613
You just fucked up the whole party,
you fucking idiot!

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:12.242
Party's over, Winston.

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.068
Son,

01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:13.446
we need you to start from the beginning.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.410
What did you say? Is it safe?

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:22.372
Where's Jeff? Did you find Jeff?

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.500
How did everybody get sick?

01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.048
Everybody's dead.

01:23:35.593 --> 01:23:37.887
We need to know

01:23:37.971 --> 01:23:40.974
where you got this disease.

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:45.228
It was a guy from the woods, and he...

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:50.567
God, he looked like Bert's marshmallow.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.906
He told me he would get a tow truck.

01:23:58.908 --> 01:24:00.577
I should have killed him, too.

01:24:19.929 --> 01:24:22.974
We're not equipped
to handle a situation like this.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.477
Cook County is his only shot.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.770
Fine.

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.606
You put him in the car.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.442
I'll take care of him.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.034
Hey, look who's waking up.

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.369
It's the fucking party man.

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.497
Guess the party ain't over, huh?

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.999
You're gonna have a long night of partying,
man, I'm gonna tell you that.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:49.542
A long night.

01:24:50.543 --> 01:24:54.297
- Water.
- I ain't got no water, man. All I got's a 40.

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:57.300
But if you want some water,
I'll find some for you, okay?

01:24:57.383 --> 01:25:00.970
You just sit tight, buddy, man.
I'll take care of you.

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:02.472
Water...

01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.499
Holy shit.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.261
They're dead.

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:52.183
My God, they're all dead.

01:27:56.729 --> 01:27:58.231
And I made it.

01:28:01.484 --> 01:28:02.819
I made it.

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:07.323
God, I made it.

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:11.327
I did it.

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.663
I fucking made it.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:17.500
I fucking made it.

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.043
I did it.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:22.046
I fucking made it!

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.840
I knew it!

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:26.843
I knew it! I fucking made it!

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:31.514
I fucking made it!

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.518
I made it!

01:28:36.352 --> 01:28:38.062
I fucking made it!

01:28:56.873 --> 01:28:59.542
You got rid of that other one, right?

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.881
Hey, I think
there's another one in the basement.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.385
Come on, boys.

01:29:10.553 --> 01:29:12.138
Let's do this!

01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:25.044
Hey, fellows,
it's been a rough morning up here.

01:30:27.004 --> 01:30:30.967
Some health people'll be coming by.
They have some questions.

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.469
Want to know about those kids.

01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:37.765
They were out of control up there,
but we took care of them.

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:41.853
Well, tell me, have you seen anything
of Tommy and Fenster?

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:44.188
Lemonade, mister?

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:46.732
Thanks, son. Don't mind if I do.

01:30:47.024 --> 01:30:48.693
That's five cents.

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.320
Businessmen.

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:54.615
You almost take after your granddaddy.

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:56.325
Why, they're running me
out of my own business,

01:30:56.409 --> 01:30:59.495
just stealing me blind,
right here on the porch.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.665
Whoa! Now that is mighty fine.

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:07.837
Mighty fine. Grab a cup, boys.
This round's on me.

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:32.236
Here you go, all polished and everything.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.446
- Isn't that a beauty?
- It's so beautiful, man.

01:31:33.529 --> 01:31:35.364
Look at that, honey.
Looks like it's brand-new.

01:31:35.615 --> 01:31:37.450
- Yeah, man, look, thank you...
- Hi, my niggas. How are you?

01:31:37.533 --> 01:31:38.993
What's up, nigga? What you doing?

01:31:39.076 --> 01:31:40.661
Where you been, man? Where you been?

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.997
Snap, I can't do it like y'all do.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.208
- That's a little better.
- Man, that's how you do it.
