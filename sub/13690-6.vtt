WEBVTT

00:05.099 --> 00:08.350
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

00:22.067 --> 00:24.527
-They'll be here any minute.
-Calm down, Hector.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.278
We haven't won this race for
years. It's time to restore
the family honour, Golly.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.116
Here they come.

00:41.745 --> 00:43.621
Right on time, Kilwillie.

00:43.705 --> 00:46.707
-Lovely day, old chap.
-Yes, isn't it.

00:46.790 --> 00:49.250
Well, where is he?

00:49.333 --> 00:51.251
Where's who?

00:51.334 --> 00:52.918
Well, Archie, of course.

00:53.002 --> 00:56.045
Aren't you here to
declare your intention
to race against me?

00:56.129 --> 00:58.046
Well, not you, Hector.

00:58.130 --> 01:01.507
The Flight of the Maiden
Boat Race is between the Laird
of Kilwillie Castle

01:01.590 --> 01:03.800
and the Laird of Glenbogle.

01:06.343 --> 01:07.719
Oh, dear.

01:45.117 --> 01:47.410
And in accordance
with the custom,

01:47.493 --> 01:50.995
I invite the laird,
and the man of his choice,

01:51.078 --> 01:56.290
to race against me,
and the man of my choice,
to rescue a fair maiden.

01:56.373 --> 01:58.082
That's me.

01:58.166 --> 02:02.918
Do you,
as a true and honest man,
undertake to accept

02:03.002 --> 02:07.464
this solemn challenge as
is your right and duty?

02:07.547 --> 02:10.049
-This is worse than a wedding.
-Answer him, man.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.341
-And what do I say?
-I do.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.800
Well?

02:15.593 --> 02:19.304
Oh, I do. I very much do.

02:21.263 --> 02:25.223
This race has been
rowed the same way
for nearly 200 years.

02:25.307 --> 02:27.476
Father, I really don't
have time for all this.

02:27.559 --> 02:30.518
Oh, in that case
I'll tell Kilwillie
I'm taking your place.

02:30.602 --> 02:32.604
The laird has to
rise to the challenge.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.647
Besides, Archie used to
be jolly good at rowing.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.650
Your grandfather,
there was an oarsman.
Won this race every time.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.942
I'm expecting these people
from Glasgow any minute.

02:43.026 --> 02:46.028
-What was that?
-Oh, nothing for
you to worry about.

02:46.111 --> 02:47.737
Who are these
people you're meeting?

02:47.820 --> 02:50.489
They're coming to help Archie
market the spring water.

02:50.572 --> 02:51.698
It's nothing sinister.

02:51.782 --> 02:54.617
Of course it's sinister,
they're from Glasgow.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.285
Why don't you go
and enjoy yourself?

02:57.369 --> 02:58.577
How exactly?

02:58.661 --> 03:00.787
Oh, I don't know.
Shoot something.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.621
That usually cheers you up.

03:07.041 --> 03:09.125
(GRUNTING)

03:09.209 --> 03:12.586
MAN ON RADIO: Later we'll be
talking to the Chief Executive
of the Highland Council.

03:12.669 --> 03:16.755
Find out what role the
Highlands has to play in the
new and evolved Scotland,

03:16.838 --> 03:19.090
and ask whether rule from
Westminster is simply going to

03:19.173 --> 03:21.424
be replaced by rule from
Edinburgh.

03:21.508 --> 03:23.509
MAN: Don't trust any of them.

03:23.592 --> 03:26.344
"Don't trust them,"
says Davey.
But who can you trust, then?

03:26.427 --> 03:29.221
DAVEY: Certainly not
the Caley Thistle defence.

03:29.304 --> 03:31.764
After two superbly crafted
goals in the first half,

03:31.847 --> 03:34.516
they snatched defeat
from the jaws of
victory last night,

03:34.599 --> 03:37.642
going down 3-2
against a revived Clydebank.

03:37.725 --> 03:40.185
-All the Bankies goals...
-Yes!

03:40.269 --> 03:45.689
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!

03:45.772 --> 03:49.233
I can just about
hear you, Archie.
I'm afraid we're lost.

04:08.619 --> 04:11.705
I'm sorry, no photos.
I've only just
heard the news myself.

04:11.788 --> 04:14.873
And you can tell your
colleague I'm not ready to
give interviews.

04:14.957 --> 04:17.624
-Come again?
-Okay, yeah.
Think I've got that.

04:17.708 --> 04:20.043
See you in a bit, then. Yep.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.669
But I will say
I intend to win.

04:22.752 --> 04:26.964
And when I do, I'll do all
I can for the real
people of this area.

04:30.924 --> 04:33.301
My mother always warned me
not to come this far north.

04:33.384 --> 04:37.053
I'll bet she also
told you to keep away
from strange men.

04:53.146 --> 04:56.189
I tell you, I'm away
from Glenbogle for good.

04:56.273 --> 04:58.065
And what has Lexie done now?

04:58.149 --> 05:01.443
Don't talk to me about women.
I'm done with women.

05:01.526 --> 05:03.861
LEXIE: Is this your
idea of a joke, Duncan?

05:03.944 --> 05:07.071
-Sorry?
-I found this hanging
on the washing line.

05:07.155 --> 05:09.197
That must have
given you a nasty turn.

05:09.281 --> 05:12.408
-Great ugly face
just staring at you.
-I'm used to that.

05:12.491 --> 05:14.618
I spend all day round him.

05:15.868 --> 05:19.203
-Well?
-It's got
nothing to do with me.

05:19.287 --> 05:23.205
-Well, someone put it there.
-Or something.

05:23.289 --> 05:25.582
Have you never
heard of Red Bonnet?

05:27.750 --> 05:30.710
-It's nonsense, Golly.
-Ach,
well, you used to believe.

05:30.793 --> 05:32.212
"Please, Golly," you'd say,

05:32.295 --> 05:34.755
"please tell us the tale
of Red Bonnet
and his treasure."

05:34.838 --> 05:38.298
Yeah, when I was six.
I didn't know you really
believed all that stuff.

05:38.381 --> 05:42.759
Archie, lad, with matters of
the other world it's best to
keep an open mind.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.594
That fish could be
the pointer to untold riches.

05:45.677 --> 05:48.846
Well, so could that
spring water project
if these people do a good job.

05:48.930 --> 05:52.932
Just make sure they get
a feel for the place, okay?

05:53.015 --> 05:58.894
Archie. Hi. Fiona Lennox,
Lennox Marketing.

05:58.977 --> 06:01.520
-GAVIN: Great costume.
-Oh, and this is Gavin.

06:03.521 --> 06:05.606
Welcome to Glenbogle.

06:05.689 --> 06:07.066
Thank you.

06:08.899 --> 06:10.026
Hello.

06:18.405 --> 06:21.032
Might actually win this year
with you and Archie rowing.

06:21.115 --> 06:24.326
Aye.
Be nice to go out on a bang.

06:24.409 --> 06:25.576
Go out?

06:25.660 --> 06:27.953
-I'm leaving.
-Right.

06:28.036 --> 06:30.287
The best way is to
decide where the door is,

06:30.371 --> 06:32.705
put one foot in front of the
other and pass through it,

06:32.789 --> 06:34.874
taking care to open it
of course.

06:34.958 --> 06:36.625
No, I mean for good.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.460
Why is that, then?

06:40.710 --> 06:41.795
Well...

06:46.297 --> 06:49.508
I've always felt I was born
to live a more exciting life.

06:49.591 --> 06:53.093
Like the song says, "In
a city that never sleeps."

06:53.176 --> 06:55.052
-Such as?
-Dundee.

06:57.429 --> 06:59.681
A place where I can
discover my true potential.

06:59.764 --> 07:02.515
And what did you have in mind?
Particle physics?

07:02.598 --> 07:03.975
Mock all you like.

07:05.058 --> 07:08.352
I'm born for greater things.

07:08.435 --> 07:13.814
Lexie, dear, I'm looking for
the biggest
cake tin we've got.

07:13.897 --> 07:17.441
Listen, there are things
that I have to be doing,
you know.

07:18.608 --> 07:20.985
Just one more. Great.

07:21.861 --> 07:23.486
And again.

07:23.570 --> 07:27.780
And this is what we did
for
the Pitlochry spring water.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.532
Right. Great.

07:47.959 --> 07:51.712
We'll have to do your logo and
find the right image for
the artwork, of course.

07:51.795 --> 07:54.213
Don't tell her anything,
Archie.

07:54.297 --> 07:57.048
-I'm sorry?
-You lot don't
waste any time, do you?

07:57.132 --> 08:00.133
-Katrina,
this is Fiona she's...
-From the press.

08:00.216 --> 08:03.385
I'm sorry, Archie,
I wanted to tell you myself.

08:03.468 --> 08:06.470
-Why is Golly
posing like that?
-Like what?

08:06.554 --> 08:10.014
-Just look to me, to me.
-Like he's in
an ad for shortbread.

08:10.097 --> 08:12.640
Oh, not shortbread. Water.

08:18.394 --> 08:19.978
A marketing company?

08:20.061 --> 08:22.063
I found them in
the Yellow Pages.

08:22.147 --> 08:25.648
And their master plan is to
put Golly's hairy
legs on the label?

08:25.732 --> 08:29.109
-They're just trying to
capture a feel for the place.
-What?

08:29.193 --> 08:31.569
To attract outside investment.

08:31.652 --> 08:35.111
Outside investment
means outside control.

08:35.196 --> 08:37.448
The only reason I
agreed to help you with this

08:37.530 --> 08:40.491
was because
the spring could mean
jobs for people round here.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.950
So how else are we
gonna raise the money?

08:43.034 --> 08:47.412
I've been selected
as candidate for the local
council election.

08:54.624 --> 08:55.833
Excuse me.

09:04.214 --> 09:06.965
"Well done, Katrina.
You must be so pleased."

09:07.049 --> 09:09.258
How much time is
this gonna take up?

09:09.342 --> 09:11.760
Archie,
you're not my employer.

09:11.843 --> 09:15.178
Anyway, it's the
school holidays. I'll have
plenty of time to campaign.

09:15.261 --> 09:18.847
Which will leave you no time
at all to help me find
funding for the spring.

09:18.931 --> 09:21.015
We've got to think long-term.

09:21.098 --> 09:24.059
I might be able
to get us funding
if I win this election.

09:24.142 --> 09:27.644
Great. I'll tell you what,
as backup,
I'll buy a lottery ticket.

09:29.062 --> 09:31.230
Thanks very much for
the vote of confidence.

09:31.313 --> 09:34.524
You know that Kilwillie's held
that council
seat for centuries.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.733
Kilwillie's been
systematically exploiting this
land for God...

09:37.817 --> 09:40.318
All right, you're not
on the hustings yet.

09:40.401 --> 09:43.695
Trust you not to take
an interest in
anyone but yourself.

09:45.530 --> 09:46.697
Excuse me.

09:49.825 --> 09:52.784
I asked your butler to
take our bags to our rooms.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.077
Butler?

09:55.911 --> 09:58.037
Hector, she wasn't to know.

09:59.789 --> 10:04.250
Father this is Fiona
Lennox from Glasgow.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.209
Katrina, wait.

10:06.292 --> 10:11.003
I'm so sorry, Mr MacDonald.
I... I just didn't
realise who you were.

10:12.004 --> 10:13.380
Why should you?

10:13.463 --> 10:15.714
I'll fetch help for the bags.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.428
Look, I was only trying
to move things along a bit.

10:22.510 --> 10:26.721
That's not the point.
Why didn't you tell me?

10:26.805 --> 10:30.598
We talked about working
on the spring water
project as a team.

10:30.682 --> 10:33.058
If we're a team,
you should consult
me on everything.

10:33.142 --> 10:35.184
I know, I'm sorry.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.937
Look, why don't you
come round tonight
and we'll talk strategy?

10:39.020 --> 10:41.188
Well, what about
Saatchi and Saatchi?

10:41.272 --> 10:43.773
I'll tell them we need
a private chat
about the project.

10:43.857 --> 10:47.359
-Our project.
-Okay.

10:47.442 --> 10:50.694
I tell you what, apparently a
friendly spirit brought us
a pike last night.

10:50.777 --> 10:52.362
-A what?
-Don't ask.

10:52.445 --> 10:54.946
But I could cook it, you know.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.115
I better go and earn my supper
by looking over
those accounts.

11:05.286 --> 11:07.454
So that's where all
my mixed peel went?

11:07.537 --> 11:10.956
Well,
don't they always say, dear,

11:11.039 --> 11:14.667
the quickest way
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

11:14.751 --> 11:18.377
My mother always said it was
straight through the ribs
with a boning knife.

11:18.461 --> 11:20.795
I didn't think it was
anyone's birthday for a bit.

11:20.879 --> 11:23.130
No. No, it's not.

11:29.676 --> 11:34.262
Gavin, I think you should let
Archie show you
round the estate.

11:34.345 --> 11:38.973
Oh, super. Careful with that.
It's expensive equipment.

11:40.807 --> 11:42.767
Oh, who's that?

11:43.601 --> 11:45.101
That's Duncan.

11:45.727 --> 11:47.603
Very cute.

11:47.686 --> 11:51.689
Don't waste your time on him.
He isn't
interested in lassies.

11:53.482 --> 11:54.940
Is that so?

12:11.076 --> 12:12.160
Hi.

12:12.910 --> 12:14.620
Hello.

12:14.703 --> 12:16.537
I was told there
was a fax machine.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.997
Okay.

12:21.957 --> 12:24.584
Listen, I'm sorry
about my behaviour earlier.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.460
It must have seemed a bit odd.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.920
Oh, it's okay,
Archie explained everything.

12:30.170 --> 12:34.215
Did he now? Good old Archie.

12:34.298 --> 12:38.175
You must be
thrilled to be selected.
Congratulations.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.259
Do you know, you're
the first person to say that.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.970
-Well,
I know how much it means.
-Really?

12:44.054 --> 12:46.514
Oh, I've been in
the party for years.

12:46.597 --> 12:49.140
I've often thought about
standing myself but never

12:49.224 --> 12:52.475
quite had the time or
maybe the bottle.

12:52.558 --> 12:55.602
Anyway, win or lose,
you're doing a really
good thing, Katrina.

12:55.685 --> 12:57.520
Well, thank you very much.

13:01.773 --> 13:05.400
So, Roger, did Kilwillie
send you down
here to spy on us?

13:05.483 --> 13:09.194
Leave the lad alone.
He's here just to help
with the launching site.

13:14.406 --> 13:17.907
So, Roger,
how often do you work out?

13:28.914 --> 13:31.249
People round here
should be running
their own affairs.

13:31.332 --> 13:34.334
Running the estate,
the spring water scheme,

13:34.418 --> 13:38.378
instead of tolerating some
outdated feudal regime.

13:38.461 --> 13:41.380
You make it sound
like Glenbogle's
still in the Dark Ages.

13:41.463 --> 13:43.256
Well, it is.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.465
I mean,
take this silly boat race
they're having tomorrow.

13:45.549 --> 13:47.383
A boat race?

13:47.466 --> 13:51.928
Grown men pretending to rescue
defenceless maidens
from across the loch.

13:52.886 --> 13:55.680
Just sounds like a bit of fun.

13:55.763 --> 13:59.307
Well, it is,
but it's backward-looking.

13:59.391 --> 14:01.809
It's like when we play
the English at football

14:01.892 --> 14:05.644
all those banners saying
"Remember Bannockburn".

14:05.728 --> 14:11.148
When are we going to
forget about the past and do
something about the future?

14:11.231 --> 14:14.442
So, what's your game
plan for the election?

14:15.775 --> 14:18.736
-Game plan?
-Campaign strategy.

14:20.361 --> 14:21.863
I take it you have one?

14:31.160 --> 14:35.037
You know, living round here,
you forget how
fantastic the scenery is.

14:38.372 --> 14:39.582
(GROANING)

14:40.540 --> 14:42.292
I can manage.

14:42.374 --> 14:43.542
I said I can...

14:43.625 --> 14:44.876
(GROANING)

14:44.959 --> 14:47.170
Roger! Are you all right?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.212
It was an accident.

15:00.093 --> 15:02.262
Yes, it's the ring all right.

15:02.345 --> 15:03.846
-And what's so special
about it?

15:03.929 --> 15:05.638
-It's the laird's ring,
Archie.

15:05.722 --> 15:08.766
Passed down
through generations.

15:08.849 --> 15:11.392
-To my eternal shame,
I lost it some years ago.

15:11.476 --> 15:13.185
-Well, now you've got it
back again.

15:13.268 --> 15:15.478
-It's Kilwillie's now.
-What?

15:15.561 --> 15:18.980
The tradition says
that the ring belongs
to the clan that finds it.

15:19.064 --> 15:20.648
And Kilwillie's man found it.

15:20.731 --> 15:23.149
You're joking? Surely
you can prove it's ours?

15:23.232 --> 15:26.526
I don't think your 16th
century ancestor kept
the receipt, Archie.

15:26.610 --> 15:30.236
16th century?
Must be worth a fortune.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.030
This could be the answer
to all our problems.

15:33.113 --> 15:35.198
My father gave me that ring.

15:35.281 --> 15:37.158
His father gave it to him.

15:37.241 --> 15:41.160
Just as every laird
did for nearly 400 years.

15:41.243 --> 15:44.371
There are more
important things
in life than money.

15:44.454 --> 15:47.538
And even if we still did
have it, I'd never sell it.

15:48.498 --> 15:50.248
Never, do you hear?

15:55.835 --> 15:58.837
I was only thinking of him.
Of all this.

15:58.921 --> 16:00.463
I know.

16:00.546 --> 16:03.674
So what do we know
about the other candidates,
then?

16:03.757 --> 16:07.634
There's only one
worth worrying about.
And he's over there.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.802
Angus Kilwillie.

16:12.971 --> 16:15.263
It's quite
an interesting little trinket.

16:15.347 --> 16:17.640
Well done. Thank you.

16:17.723 --> 16:20.767
It's Red Bonnet
you have to thank.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.102
That old wives' tale.

16:23.185 --> 16:27.063
It's best to keep an open mind
in matters of the other world.

16:27.146 --> 16:30.731
There's only one
world that matters,
Golly, and this is it.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.066
A man's gotta take
control of his own destiny.

16:33.149 --> 16:37.152
Sitting councillor,
local land owner,
and robber baron.

16:37.236 --> 16:39.362
He's had the place in
his pocket for years.

16:39.445 --> 16:42.446
-And what sleaze
do we have on him?
-Sorry?

16:42.530 --> 16:45.115
You know, dirt, scandal.

16:45.198 --> 16:47.908
Hang on,
you're not in Glasgow now.

16:47.992 --> 16:50.910
We don't run those type
of campaigns round here.

16:50.994 --> 16:54.037
Oh, really? So how come
he's been in
office so long, then?

16:54.121 --> 16:56.956
I bet he has his tricky
little ways and means.

16:57.039 --> 16:59.416
Miss Finlay.

16:59.499 --> 17:02.667
-I gather you're
standing against me.
-Oh, how did you know that?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.460
I only found out this morning.

17:04.544 --> 17:07.045
Oh,
I've got my ways and means.

17:08.587 --> 17:10.463
So, what's your platform?

17:10.547 --> 17:13.715
Oh, you'll find out
soon enough, Mr Kilwillie.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.592
Going to throw all us
dastardly land
owners out, are you?

17:16.675 --> 17:20.011
Oh, dear me, better get home
and pull up my drawbridge.

17:20.970 --> 17:22.804
Well, good luck.

17:22.887 --> 17:25.638
And may the best man win.

17:27.557 --> 17:29.766
Now that you mention it,

17:29.850 --> 17:34.312
there was a bit of gossip
about him and a certain lady
from Loch Nacree.

17:36.896 --> 17:38.272
Argh!

17:38.355 --> 17:40.398
-Hector!
-Haven't you
heard of knocking?

17:40.481 --> 17:43.400
If you want to get rid of me,
it's less messy
to sue for divorce.

17:43.483 --> 17:45.317
-What are you playing at?
-All is not lost.

17:45.401 --> 17:47.028
Hector, please.

17:47.111 --> 17:50.362
-The only way to get
that ring back is by combat!
-Combat?

17:50.446 --> 17:53.990
-I shall challenge Kilwillie.
-You will do no such thing.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.407
(GRUNTING)

17:59.619 --> 18:03.370
Hector, now get a grip.
You are not a child any more.

18:03.454 --> 18:06.623
Really?
Then why does everybody
treat me like one?

18:06.705 --> 18:09.207
"Don't you worry about it,
Hector." "None of your
business, Hector."

18:09.290 --> 18:11.375
"Go and play with
your toys, Hector."

18:11.459 --> 18:13.793
Well,
I know when I'm not needed.

18:16.712 --> 18:19.672
Hector, I just came
to tell you that I...

18:20.672 --> 18:22.174
made you a cake.

18:22.256 --> 18:23.883
(DOOR SLAMMING)

18:26.468 --> 18:30.011
So, no one special
back in Glasgow, then?

18:30.094 --> 18:31.804
A nice boy like you.

18:31.888 --> 18:34.431
I've just come out of
a messy relationship.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.557
Really? What was he like?

18:38.808 --> 18:41.393
It's always
the cute ones, isn't it?

18:42.352 --> 18:44.437
Why is he always so miserable?

18:44.520 --> 18:48.564
Well, he thinks that a place
like this has got nothing to
offer someone like him.

18:48.648 --> 18:50.273
He's right there.

18:50.357 --> 18:51.566
Hey, Duncan?

18:52.316 --> 18:53.567
What?

18:53.651 --> 18:55.902
How about I get
some shots of you?

18:57.903 --> 19:00.738
Oh. Sure.

19:06.367 --> 19:09.035
Once she starts all
this election nonsense,
I'll never see her.

19:09.118 --> 19:13.537
Well, then, stop referring to
it as nonsense. People find
different things important.

19:13.621 --> 19:16.665
You should
encourage Katrina more,
listen to her more.

19:16.748 --> 19:19.166
That's the secret of
a good partnership.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.251
-I suppose you're right.
-Isn't that how it
works with Justine?

19:22.334 --> 19:24.628
-Well, that's different.
-Well, of course it is.

19:24.711 --> 19:26.963
She's your girlfriend.

19:27.046 --> 19:29.089
It must be a very
understanding relationship if

19:29.172 --> 19:31.549
it can work while you're
both so far apart.

19:31.632 --> 19:33.132
Yes, it must be.

19:33.216 --> 19:36.301
You must miss her very much.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.219
Right, I'll just go
and check on that fish.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.970
Tell Lexie I'll
be eating upstairs.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.055
-Are you sure you don't mind?
-Course not.

19:42.138 --> 19:44.682
I'll leave you and
Katrina to have a good time.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.724
It's a business dinner,
Mother.

19:47.391 --> 19:48.642
Course it is.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.400
Katrina'll never eat that.

20:01.483 --> 20:04.360
I'll have you know,
this is a big delicacy
in certain parts of Europe.

20:04.443 --> 20:07.028
A recipe known only to a few.

20:07.112 --> 20:10.572
Anyway, I called
Justine for some advice.

20:10.655 --> 20:14.740
Oh, really?
"Darling, I'm doing a
candlelit dinner for Katrina.

20:14.824 --> 20:16.576
"Could you help me
perk up my pike?"

20:16.659 --> 20:18.618
Just shut up and drain
the veg.

20:18.702 --> 20:20.953
But you did tell her
who it was for, right?

20:21.036 --> 20:22.579
In your own time.

20:46.969 --> 20:49.429
(DIALLING)

20:49.512 --> 20:52.430
Hello? I can hardly hear you.

20:52.513 --> 20:56.266
-You're an hour late.
-What? The line's really bad.

20:56.349 --> 20:58.142
Look,
I'll come over to your place.

20:58.225 --> 21:03.061
Oh, Archie, I'm so sorry.

21:04.479 --> 21:06.230
This is so embarrassing.

21:12.233 --> 21:14.444
Fiona and I just got talking.

21:14.527 --> 21:15.986
How could you forget?

21:18.279 --> 21:21.364
Fiona was helping me
draw up my manifesto.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.407
She's in the party.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.450
I'm so sorry.

21:27.659 --> 21:29.119
Fiona's working for me.

21:30.578 --> 21:32.329
I thought she
was working for us.

21:59.970 --> 22:02.347
Could you pass the salt,
please?

22:04.848 --> 22:06.850
-Pepper?
-No, thanks.

22:14.355 --> 22:17.731
He was a magnificent sight,
my father.

22:17.815 --> 22:19.857
Thrashing his way
through the water.

22:21.067 --> 22:23.443
Never lost a boat race ever.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.112
Fine huntsman, too.

22:27.195 --> 22:30.656
Everybody looked up to him.
People still needed him

22:31.406 --> 22:32.907
until the day he died.

22:34.950 --> 22:36.451
Who needs me, eh?

22:38.911 --> 22:40.620
-I was just...
-I was just...

22:40.703 --> 22:43.121
-After you.
-Go ahead.

22:43.205 --> 22:47.207
I just wanted to say I'm
really pleased you were
nominated for the election.

22:48.166 --> 22:51.085
Thank you.

22:51.168 --> 22:54.587
So you think you might be able
to get us the money for
the spring if you win?

22:54.670 --> 22:58.047
Listen, could we
discuss this tomorrow?

22:58.131 --> 23:02.133
It's just that Fiona...
I promised her I
wouldn't be long.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.759
Fine.

23:04.843 --> 23:08.554
I just thought you wanted
to talk about it tonight.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.055
Well, come on,
the spring's not going
to dry up over night.

23:11.139 --> 23:13.807
-No,
but Justine's patience might.
-Oh.

23:15.975 --> 23:19.394
-So that's what this is about?
-Sorry?

23:19.477 --> 23:22.520
You want to get
the spring up and running
as soon as possible

23:22.603 --> 23:25.272
so you can skip back to
your girlfriend in London.

23:25.355 --> 23:26.982
I do not skip.

23:27.065 --> 23:29.567
Where you can manage
your swanky restaurant

23:29.649 --> 23:32.401
and get back to what you
probably call normality.

23:34.528 --> 23:36.696
You seem very
sure of what I want.

23:39.114 --> 23:41.657
You know you're not
going to stay here forever.

23:44.367 --> 23:46.994
Go on, then.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.078
Tell me that
you've decided to stay
and run the estate.

23:53.873 --> 23:57.499
Tell me that this
is more important
to you than anything else.

24:03.795 --> 24:06.505
I'm as cynical
as the next man,

24:06.589 --> 24:10.799
but best to keep an open mind
where the other
world is concerned.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.260
If it exists,
I hope it makes more
sense than this one.

24:14.343 --> 24:16.303
Go on, Golly.

24:16.386 --> 24:18.053
Well, take Red Bonnet.

24:18.137 --> 24:22.514
Legend has it that
he steals into houses
in the dead of night.

24:22.598 --> 24:24.516
He means no harm.

24:24.599 --> 24:27.934
He leaves you a clue
to where
a treasure is to be found,

24:28.018 --> 24:31.520
then returns the next night
to claim some
supper as a reward.

24:31.604 --> 24:32.937
Oh, come on.

24:33.021 --> 24:36.398
No, Golly's right.
The fish was a sign.

24:37.815 --> 24:40.066
It led to the ring.

24:40.150 --> 24:43.235
Okay. Okay,
I'm sorry to apply logic
to the situation,

24:43.319 --> 24:46.112
but if he was hungry,
why didn't he
just eat the fish?

24:46.196 --> 24:48.530
Maybe he's
a vegetarian spirit.

24:53.033 --> 24:56.160
People always mock
what they're afraid of.

24:57.202 --> 24:59.120
Ain't that the truth.

24:59.204 --> 25:02.955
Who could be afraid of
a little man in a red cap?

25:03.039 --> 25:06.917
The forest is
full of less kindly
spirits than Red Bonnet.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.626
-Have you seen them, Golly?
-No.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.669
-ARCHIE: You see?
-Nor would I want to.

25:12.753 --> 25:15.254
But I've heard
them in the night.

25:16.255 --> 25:19.382
Whispering. Caterwauling.

25:19.466 --> 25:23.176
Coming from nowhere.
Coming from everywhere.

25:23.259 --> 25:26.303
It's just the wind or
small furry creatures.

25:26.386 --> 25:28.387
Maybe.

25:28.471 --> 25:32.640
But have you not heard the
story of Barrach-Bayne,
the Mad MacDonald?

25:32.723 --> 25:34.517
Didn't like women,
was that the one?

25:34.599 --> 25:36.893
He spent the night
alone in the woods,

25:36.976 --> 25:39.228
day before his wedding.

25:39.311 --> 25:41.896
He was to marry the daughter
of a neighbouring chief

25:41.979 --> 25:44.605
at the Great Clan
Gathering of 1611.

25:45.731 --> 25:48.441
What happened?

25:48.525 --> 25:53.486
Well, they say he lost his
mind that night or had
it taken from him.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.196
The next day at the Gathering

25:57.279 --> 26:00.824
he lifted up his
betrothed like this

26:00.907 --> 26:06.244
and, wailing like a banshee,
pitched her headlong
into the Kinrothie Bog.

26:07.786 --> 26:10.746
Near brought
down the MacDonalds.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.540
Led to 40 years
warfare in this glen.

26:13.623 --> 26:17.875
The way I heard it, she looked
better when she came out of
the bog than when she went in.

26:17.959 --> 26:19.085
Nevertheless...

26:20.877 --> 26:22.837
no MacDonald since then

26:24.046 --> 26:26.631
has ever spent the night alone

26:27.381 --> 26:28.882
in those woods.

26:31.509 --> 26:33.760
Well, it wouldn't
bother me if I did.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.013
Well, it wouldn't.

26:44.142 --> 26:47.018
I'm up at the crack of
dawn for the boat race.

26:49.811 --> 26:51.563
You think I'm scared,
don't you?

26:53.522 --> 26:55.565
Right, let's do it.

27:02.652 --> 27:04.154
(ANIMALS HOWLING)

27:06.238 --> 27:08.239
Right, this'll do.

27:09.449 --> 27:10.615
Torch.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.534
Are you sure you
still want to do this?

27:14.617 --> 27:17.786
Yeah, it's just what I need,
a night out of that madhouse.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.746
Okay, it's all yours.

27:25.207 --> 27:27.167
DUNCAN: Sounds a bit silly.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.127
Go on, it'll be a laugh and
it might just be the image we
need for the label.

27:31.795 --> 27:33.588
Oh, pardon me.

27:34.422 --> 27:36.006
I was looking for Golly.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.715
I'll go and get my stuff.

27:45.011 --> 27:48.555
Duncan, you do know
about Gavin, don't you?

27:48.638 --> 27:51.807
I know he's the first person
who ever took me seriously.

27:52.557 --> 27:55.100
-Oh?
-Aye.

27:55.184 --> 28:00.479
And he agrees I don't belong
here. Reckons I should move
to Glasgow. Find myself.

28:00.562 --> 28:03.481
What if you're not
there when you get there?

28:03.564 --> 28:05.857
Oh, go on, mock.

28:05.940 --> 28:07.649
You're just jealous
'cause you're gonna spend your

28:07.733 --> 28:09.901
whole life skivvying here

28:09.984 --> 28:11.986

28:14.528 --> 28:16.614
You're right. Of course.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.032
I wish you all the best.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.743
But may I give
you a bit of advice?

28:25.369 --> 28:26.953
What?

28:27.036 --> 28:33.040
It's just it's best
to try and be like
those big city types.

28:33.123 --> 28:35.166
You know,
if you want to fit in.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.250
How do you mean?

28:37.334 --> 28:41.587
Well, for a start,
they're very touchy-feely.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.714
Lots of hugging and stuff.

28:45.798 --> 28:48.466
-Aye, I've seen them.
-Mmm.

28:50.425 --> 28:52.426
What else?

28:52.510 --> 28:56.596
So they know you're confident,
they need eye contact.

28:57.513 --> 29:01.391
Long, lingering eye contact.

29:04.434 --> 29:05.643
Right.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.438
MOLLY: Pull yourself together,
you're not a child any more.

29:11.522 --> 29:13.606
Then why does
everyone treat me like one?

29:13.690 --> 29:15.983
"Don't you worry about it,
Hector." "None of your
business, Hector."

29:16.066 --> 29:20.318
"Go and play with your toys,
Hector." Well,
I know when I'm not needed.

29:27.406 --> 29:28.615
(TWIG SNAPPING)

29:37.078 --> 29:38.746
(CLATTERING)

30:06.847 --> 30:08.180
(YELPING)

30:11.641 --> 30:14.934
I couldn't
sleep so I came down
to add some walnuts.

30:15.018 --> 30:18.562
Maybe Red Bonnet
doesn't care for walnuts.

30:18.645 --> 30:21.772
It was Hector's favourite.

30:21.856 --> 30:25.107
The thing is, we've all
been ignoring him lately.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.650
How can anyone ignore Hector?

30:27.734 --> 30:29.568
We all run round
him like blue-ars...

30:30.902 --> 30:32.778
Like people running
round after Hector.

30:32.862 --> 30:36.197
I know, like people
running round after a child.

30:36.947 --> 30:38.741
He hates that.

30:38.824 --> 30:40.700
Poor old Hector.

30:40.783 --> 30:43.952
I'm more to blame than anyone.

30:44.036 --> 30:49.538
He's been sneaking off at
night lately, which he does
when he's feeling thoughtful.

30:49.622 --> 30:53.458
I should have just sat him
down and given him
a good talking to.

30:53.541 --> 30:56.251
Told him that we all
need him round here.

30:56.335 --> 30:59.628
Instead I made
this stupid cake.

31:04.505 --> 31:06.215
How long has this
been here, then?

31:06.299 --> 31:08.216
About half an hour.

31:11.177 --> 31:13.762
I used to love night fishing.

31:13.845 --> 31:16.347
I don't get much
chance to do it
in London, though.

31:16.430 --> 31:19.848
Well, I'm sure London
has other
night-time attractions.

31:19.932 --> 31:21.558
(YAWNING) Yeah, I guess so.

31:21.642 --> 31:24.393
You ought to be in bed
getting a good night's sleep.

31:24.476 --> 31:26.770
Preparing your mind and body
for tomorrow's battle.

31:26.853 --> 31:28.687
It's not a battle,
it's a boat race.

31:32.731 --> 31:35.399
How did that ring
end up in the loch?

31:35.483 --> 31:38.276
Didn't you hear?
Red Bonnet put it there.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.568
Father.

31:39.652 --> 31:43.404
I lost it swimming.
Stupid thing to do.

31:43.488 --> 31:46.657
"Damn stupid thing to do,
Hector," my father said.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.158
"You've really let me down.

31:49.241 --> 31:53.702
"I despair of you ever
amounting to anything."

31:53.786 --> 31:56.954
Well, I wanted to explain that
it was an accident,
it could happen to anybody.

31:57.037 --> 31:59.373
That I was sorry,
sorry I'd let him down.

32:00.665 --> 32:02.958
Well, why didn't you?

32:03.041 --> 32:07.085
Because he was
a cantankerous old git
who was impossible to talk to.

32:07.168 --> 32:09.170
Can you imagine
having a father like that?

32:09.254 --> 32:11.255
No. No, I can't.

32:27.389 --> 32:28.515
That was...

32:28.598 --> 32:29.640
(SHUSHING)

32:29.723 --> 32:32.016
...Red Bonnet.
We just saw Red Bonnet!

32:32.100 --> 32:33.101
Come on.

32:37.979 --> 32:39.938
Ye gods.

32:40.021 --> 32:44.149
-Now I've seen everything.
-GAVIN: That's it, Duncan.
More of that.

32:44.233 --> 32:48.026
More. Yeah. Great. That's it.

32:48.110 --> 32:49.902
Right arm up. Good.

32:49.986 --> 32:52.404
What's Duncan playing at?

32:52.487 --> 32:53.822
Golly was right.

32:53.905 --> 32:56.740
Some things are
beyond human comprehension.

32:56.824 --> 33:01.993
It's been a real stroke
of fortune me meeting you.

33:02.076 --> 33:07.204
I feel like I can...
I can see my whole future
stretching out in front of me.

33:07.288 --> 33:10.790
-The real me.
-Good man.

33:10.873 --> 33:14.750
That's the first step.
Admitting to
yourself who you are.

33:14.834 --> 33:16.252
Aye.

33:16.335 --> 33:18.753
And you'll meet plenty
more like you in Glasgow.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.306
Thanks for all your advice.

33:38.724 --> 33:40.141
No problem.

33:47.103 --> 33:49.188
You've really
changed my outlook.

33:51.106 --> 33:54.317
I was thinking,
when I move to Glasgow

33:55.775 --> 33:57.318
could I stay with
you for a while?

33:57.401 --> 33:58.861
Oh, Duncan.

33:59.777 --> 34:01.987
I'm really flattered.

34:02.613 --> 34:03.780
Flattered?

34:04.614 --> 34:07.741
Look, it's not you.

34:08.949 --> 34:10.201
It's me.

34:39.219 --> 34:42.303
-Oi.
-What are you doing here?

34:42.386 --> 34:46.473
Fiona and I got so wrapped up
in the manifesto, Molly said I
could stay the night.

34:47.264 --> 34:48.849
You look rough.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.476
Well, all in all,
it was a pretty rough night.

34:56.771 --> 34:58.438
I said some things
last night...

34:58.522 --> 34:59.772
Yeah, well,
you were probably right.

35:04.650 --> 35:06.777
Look, I've got a race to row.

35:09.861 --> 35:11.071
Good luck.

35:35.042 --> 35:36.961
Oh, where is everyone?

35:38.879 --> 35:40.213
(SNORING)

35:47.425 --> 35:50.511
I love you,
you silly old fool.

35:52.761 --> 35:55.764
I'd better go. Golly's
taking me to the woods.

35:55.848 --> 35:58.266
We may not be able to get
your father's ring back,

35:58.349 --> 36:01.434
but at least we can try
and win this race for him.

36:01.518 --> 36:03.853
Mother, you're a genius.
The race.

36:06.395 --> 36:09.856
-How did the photo
shoot go last night?
-Smashing.

36:09.939 --> 36:12.565
In fact, better than
I could have
possibly imagined.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.817
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.278
It went so well, Duncan's
agreed to come to Glasgow
as soon as possible.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.861
He's gonna move in with me.

36:19.944 --> 36:23.197
-You're joking!
-No.

36:23.281 --> 36:26.074
You know Duncan's
not quite the full
shilling sometimes?

36:26.158 --> 36:29.409
-Is that so?
-He's easily led astray.

36:29.492 --> 36:31.869
You'd have
first-hand experience of that,
would you?

36:31.952 --> 36:35.663
-I just don't want
to see him get hurt.
-Why is that, then?

36:35.746 --> 36:37.080
He's a pal.

36:37.873 --> 36:39.456
Really?

36:39.540 --> 36:42.250
Look, he'd be lost in Glasgow.

36:42.333 --> 36:45.627
He'd miss all his mates and...
Well, we'd miss him.

36:46.836 --> 36:48.880
Oh, Dunc!

36:48.963 --> 36:51.631
Lexie here has got
something to tell you.

36:51.715 --> 36:55.383
Uh, yeah.
Good luck in the boat race.

36:55.467 --> 36:58.552
-Yeah, thanks.
-Give 'em hell, big boy.

37:07.182 --> 37:10.601
Has Archie lost his bottle?

37:10.684 --> 37:14.187
-Thought you weren't
interested in this.
-Oh, it could be quite fun.

37:14.270 --> 37:15.520
Here's Archie.

37:18.564 --> 37:20.773
KILWILLIE: I thought
you'd thrown in the towel,
lad.

37:20.857 --> 37:23.817
GOLLY: Right, let it begin.
The maidens are in position.

37:23.901 --> 37:25.902
Hold on, Golly.

37:25.985 --> 37:30.863
Kilwillie, I challenge you
to combat for the ring of
my forefathers.

37:30.946 --> 37:32.322
I beg your pardon?

37:32.405 --> 37:35.449
I wanna race you for
that ring you're wearing.

37:35.532 --> 37:37.700
That's out of the question.
It's mine by right.

37:37.784 --> 37:39.993
You're not scared, are you?

37:42.912 --> 37:48.332
Believe me, Archie, all the
incentive in the world
won't help you win.

37:48.415 --> 37:51.584
-Right, let battle commence!
-HECTOR: Stop!

37:53.877 --> 37:55.628
Now what?

37:55.711 --> 37:59.797
Kilwillie, I challenge you to
combat for the ring of
my forefathers.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.548
Father, you don't need the
swords, I've made
the challenge already.

38:02.632 --> 38:03.883
We're racing for the ring.

38:03.966 --> 38:06.343
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so?

38:06.426 --> 38:08.260
-Move over, Duncan.
-What?

38:08.344 --> 38:11.387
Take those, will you?

38:11.471 --> 38:16.432
Archie, as laird, it is your
privilege to choose your
comrade in oars.

38:21.685 --> 38:24.187
You can all row
together for all I care.

38:24.812 --> 38:26.063
Roger!

38:31.650 --> 38:33.901
HECTOR: Good God.

38:33.984 --> 38:37.069
Well, there's nothing
in the rules against it.
Is there, Golly?

38:42.864 --> 38:44.406
It's a stealth boat.

38:48.576 --> 38:52.745
-That man is unbelievable.
-Right, that does it.

38:52.829 --> 38:55.747
Do you know where he picks up
the so-called maidens?

38:55.831 --> 38:58.207
I think so. Why?

38:58.290 --> 39:02.084
First rule of politics.
Do it to them
before they do it to you.

39:02.501 --> 39:03.627
Come on.

39:10.172 --> 39:13.675
GOLLY: Right, the maidens
are on the other
side of the loch.

39:13.758 --> 39:17.176
The laird must accompany
the maiden back and
the first team to take

39:17.260 --> 39:19.511
their seat is the winner.

39:19.594 --> 39:23.097
-Are our warriors ready?
-Oh, get on with it.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.723
On your marks, get set...

39:35.688 --> 39:38.189
Oh, they must have
been practising all year.

39:38.273 --> 39:40.816
KILWILLIE: Stroke. Stroke.

39:41.774 --> 39:43.609
We've got no chance.

39:49.196 --> 39:53.407
-It just doesn't seem right.
-Look, you don't want
Kilwillie to win, do you?

39:57.659 --> 40:01.203
-Archie's really cute,
isn't he?
-Is he?

40:05.873 --> 40:09.125
You're finished, MacDonald.
You're past it.

40:09.208 --> 40:10.751
I want that ring, Kilwillie.

40:18.047 --> 40:20.506
-It's no good.
-Nil desperandum.

40:21.798 --> 40:23.508
(CAMERA CLICKING)

40:25.342 --> 40:26.760
Well?

40:26.843 --> 40:28.720
Kilwillie's walking it.

40:32.930 --> 40:37.266
Look, this Gavin,
you do know that he's...

40:37.349 --> 40:39.143
Lexie.

40:39.225 --> 40:42.019
I didn't really know it

40:42.102 --> 40:45.438
but I've been
waiting for someone
like Gavin all my life.

40:45.521 --> 40:48.231
And I'm really looking forward
to living in a big city.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.357
Duncan, you'll hate Glasgow.

40:50.441 --> 40:53.985
It's full of scary
and selfish people.
And that's just my family.

40:54.069 --> 40:57.487
Just because you couldn't
take the pace, doesn't mean to
say that I won't.

40:57.570 --> 40:59.780
Anyway, Gavin'll be
there to see me through.

41:01.615 --> 41:03.407
You've made up
your mind, then?

41:04.366 --> 41:05.867
Nothing to keep me here.

41:05.950 --> 41:08.952
Of course there is.
Nobody wants you to go.

41:12.662 --> 41:14.830
I don't want you to go.

41:14.914 --> 41:17.374
There, I said it.

41:26.671 --> 41:28.881
Are you sure this
is going to work?

41:28.964 --> 41:31.549
Look, we're just going
for a walk in the woods.

41:31.633 --> 41:34.842
He doesn't have
to stop and chat
if he doesn't want to.

41:36.678 --> 41:37.844
Right.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.848
FLORA: Daddy!

41:45.265 --> 41:46.558
MOLLY: Archie!

41:48.351 --> 41:50.227
Archie?

41:53.020 --> 41:56.231
-Daddy?
-I'm coming, Flora.

41:56.314 --> 42:00.650
KATRINA: (ECHOING) Kilwillie.
FIONA: (ECHOING)
Loch Nacree, Kilwillie.

42:10.572 --> 42:12.156
Right, that's it.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.950
FLORA: Roger, I'm here.

42:14.033 --> 42:17.034
Come and take me now, Roger!

42:17.118 --> 42:19.786
Steady on,
dear, it's only pretend.

42:19.869 --> 42:23.831
Roger! Roger, where's Daddy?

42:24.580 --> 42:25.748
Come on.

42:25.832 --> 42:27.499
(FLORA LAUGHING)

42:40.424 --> 42:42.258

42:42.341 --> 42:44.718
BOTH: Kilwillie.

42:44.801 --> 42:48.012
KATRINA: Remember Loch Nacree.

42:48.095 --> 42:49.262
Stop.

42:49.345 --> 42:51.222
-FIONA: Kilwillie.
-Who are you?

42:51.305 --> 42:54.223
KATRINA: Loch Nacree.

42:55.141 --> 42:57.225
Where are you?

42:58.226 --> 43:01.061
-Mother.
-Hector.

43:01.145 --> 43:05.105
-What are you doing here?
-No time for conversation,
woman. Come on.

43:07.189 --> 43:10.692
-Tell us about
the lady from Loch Nacree.
-Who are you?

43:10.775 --> 43:12.818
KATRINA: Loch Nacree.

43:12.901 --> 43:15.570
And what about Loch Nacree?

43:15.653 --> 43:18.405
-I haven't seen
that girl for years.
-Kilwillie.

43:18.488 --> 43:20.406
It was all lies anyway.

43:22.032 --> 43:25.200
-Daddy!
-Loch Nacree.

43:25.284 --> 43:27.201
(ECHOING)

43:36.249 --> 43:37.249
Daddy!

43:38.167 --> 43:39.959
They've caught up.

43:41.377 --> 43:43.211
We're going to lose.

43:46.671 --> 43:48.798
Come on, Archie. Come on.

43:48.882 --> 43:51.592
MacDonald. I don't
know what's going on here.

43:51.674 --> 43:53.676
Just get in, will you?

43:55.761 --> 43:57.428
(KILWILLIE PANTING)

43:58.596 --> 44:01.097
Get a move on, Archie.

44:01.181 --> 44:02.681
They're not far behind.

44:16.939 --> 44:19.941
-GOLLY: I don't
believe it, we're winning.
-Roger's catching up fast.

44:20.025 --> 44:22.735
Come on!

44:22.818 --> 44:25.820
Come on, Archie, come on.
For the ring. For the ring!

44:25.904 --> 44:28.781
-Come on,
Roger, get a move on!
-Faster!

44:30.323 --> 44:32.699
Oh,
put your back into it, man.

44:37.118 --> 44:38.703
FLORA: Roger, come on.

44:38.787 --> 44:41.580
-LEXIE: Come on, Archie, row!
-Keep rowing, Archie.

44:41.663 --> 44:43.206
Come on, Archie.

44:44.331 --> 44:47.249
Come on, boys!

44:47.333 --> 44:52.419
LEXIE: Come on.
Oh, Archie, go on!
Hurry up! Oh, you can do it.

44:55.129 --> 44:57.673
Show some muscle.
Move it. Come on.

45:00.383 --> 45:03.301
KATRINA: Come on.
Come on, Archie.

45:09.388 --> 45:10.973
(ALL CHEERING)

45:15.809 --> 45:17.977
I am so proud of you.

45:18.060 --> 45:19.936
Well done, Arch.

45:23.605 --> 45:25.106
Well done, Archie.

45:29.733 --> 45:30.985
Oh, Duncan.

45:38.614 --> 45:39.864
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

45:43.450 --> 45:44.826
Oh, darling.

45:47.953 --> 45:49.495
Thank you.

46:01.461 --> 46:04.337
-Disembodied voices
in the wood, you say?
-Quite right.

46:04.421 --> 46:07.631
-They were all over the place.
-What were they saying?

46:08.591 --> 46:10.508
I couldn't quite make it out.

46:11.592 --> 46:14.885
It was a damned
strange affair.

46:14.969 --> 46:17.345
-HECTOR: There'll be
a rational explanation.
-Course there will.

46:17.429 --> 46:20.222
We all thought that Red Bonnet
had brought us a fish

46:20.306 --> 46:23.182
until we
discovered that Hector
had been off night fishing.

46:23.266 --> 46:26.518
Mmm. Didn't catch a damn
thing all week, though.

46:26.601 --> 46:30.103
Well,
then, who did bring the fish?

46:30.186 --> 46:34.898
Ah, well, you see there's
no accounting for the ways of
the other world.

46:38.942 --> 46:41.444
-Slainte.
-Slainte.

46:45.696 --> 46:48.907
You were right,
she's gutted at
the thought of me going.

46:48.990 --> 46:50.741
She's crazy about you, man.

46:50.824 --> 46:54.910
A bit unfair,
kidding her on that
you and me were...

46:56.411 --> 46:58.412
Well, you know.

46:58.495 --> 47:02.080
What, after she tried
to set you up last night?

47:02.164 --> 47:04.041
You're too good for her.

47:07.584 --> 47:10.377
I still think you could
make a go of it in Glasgow.

47:12.420 --> 47:14.796
They do have women there,
too, you know.

47:19.008 --> 47:23.344
Aye, but I couldn't leave here
knowing how much
Lexie needs me.

47:23.427 --> 47:25.136
She'd be lost without me.

47:28.597 --> 47:31.390
-All right, Lex?
-Don't "all right" me.

47:31.474 --> 47:34.225
-I've been
listening to you two.
-Oh, dear.

47:34.308 --> 47:37.936
-You sneaky little...
-You can talk.

47:38.019 --> 47:41.355
"They love eye contact."
You didn't tell me why.

47:41.438 --> 47:46.274
Well, you can run off to
Glasgow for all I care.

47:46.358 --> 47:50.818
What you asked me yesterday
about whether I'll be
staying around much longer.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.070
The truth is I don't know.

47:53.153 --> 47:54.695
LEXIE: I'll catch you!

47:54.779 --> 47:57.405
-Right.
-LEXIE: When I do,
I'm gonna hurt you.

47:57.489 --> 48:01.283
The thing is, I'm no longer
absolutely sure
that I won't be either.

48:01.367 --> 48:03.785
This place,
it gets under your skin.

48:05.202 --> 48:08.371
Well,
it's always been under mine.

48:08.454 --> 48:11.248
That's why I want to do
what I can for the place.

48:11.331 --> 48:14.332
Give something back, you know.

48:14.415 --> 48:16.750
That's what my
manifesto's about.

48:24.672 --> 48:26.465
"By far the most
compelling reason

48:26.548 --> 48:29.341
"for transferring the estate
to the control of the tenants

48:29.424 --> 48:32.051
"is the damage
that has accrued
to the land and resources

48:32.134 --> 48:36.137
"due to years of
exploitation and incompetence
by the incumbent family."

48:36.221 --> 48:39.097
-Fiona wrote that bit.
-Yeah,
but you think it, don't you?

48:39.180 --> 48:41.807
-You know it's true.
-Do I indeed?

48:41.890 --> 48:44.308
You said so yourself.

48:44.392 --> 48:47.060
This place has been
run into the ground.

48:47.143 --> 48:49.728
Oh, and you're gonna save it
single-handed, are you?

48:49.812 --> 48:52.063
Well,
if that's what it takes, yes.

48:52.146 --> 48:54.356
Och, I just can't
believe you've done this.

48:54.439 --> 48:56.983
-I haven't done anything.
-"Working together" you said.

48:57.066 --> 49:00.402
KATRINA: And so that
means I can't criticise you?

49:03.529 --> 49:07.406
So, how often do you work out?

49:15.286 --> 49:16.828
(GROANING)

49:29.169 --> 49:30.253
Eh?
