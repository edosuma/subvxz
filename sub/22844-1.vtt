14:29.542 --> 14:30.166
- Call the police.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.417
- Don't call the police.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.625
- We should call his parents.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.166
- Are you trying
to get us arrested?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.125
- I'm with Carlo, we call the
cops and turn ourselves in.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.625
- I'm not turning myself in.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.000
- If we turn ourselves in we
can tell him it was an accident

14:38.000 --> 14:39.291
and maybe they'll
let us off the hook.

14:39.291 --> 14:41.875
- Everyone just
stop for a second!

14:41.875 --> 14:44.041
It doesn't matter if
it was an accident.

14:44.041 --> 14:47.208
Trust me when I say
it doesn't matter.

14:51.875 --> 14:54.166
When I was a freshman,
I knew this guy.

14:54.166 --> 14:58.375
He was driving home after
a football game, drunk.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.375
And he hit this kid.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.959
And they put him
away for a long time.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.667
- This is different.

15:06.542 --> 15:07.125
- Yeah, you're right.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.166
The kid he hit lived.

15:10.291 --> 15:10.333
Get it?

15:11.959 --> 15:13.208
- Not really.

15:13.208 --> 15:16.250
- He means that we'd
get fried for this.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.375
- So do we know which
one of us shot him?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.375
- [Scott] What do you mean?

15:24.375 --> 15:26.041
- [Carlo] I mean, we all
didn't shoot him right?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.291
Like it had to be one of us...

15:27.291 --> 15:27.750
- Oh, don't start
with that shit.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.959
We all did this.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.250
- Shit.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.500
- Wait, how did he get here?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.625
- [Scott] Why?

15:40.625 --> 15:42.291
- Because, if someone
dropped him off like his mom

15:42.291 --> 15:46.667
or something then they
would had know he...

15:46.667 --> 15:47.542
Shit!

16:13.250 --> 16:14.166
He rode his bike here.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.041
- Do we have any herb?

16:22.041 --> 16:22.917
- Yeah.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.625
- When did you
fuckers start smoking?

16:30.625 --> 16:33.291
- A couple weeks ago?

16:33.291 --> 16:35.083
- Yeah, well.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.125
That shit will kill you.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.583
- Chill dude.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.542
It's just pot, I think we got
bigger things to worry about.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.417
- Fine, whatever.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.083
Let's just stay focused, please.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.333
I say we...

16:48.333 --> 16:53.458
We drive all night and
bury him somewhere far.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.625
- We can't do that.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.375
I mean, they always
find the body.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.208
(coughing)

17:05.000 --> 17:06.250
- Shit's strong.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.916
- Nah dude, it's just swag.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.165
It's weak, it means it's weak.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.000
- Oh.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.250
I feel like such a johnson.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.541
- What the hell are you doing?

17:18.541 --> 17:19.834
- It's hot, I need some air.

17:19.834 --> 17:22.416
That's much better.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.625
- Are you insane?

17:23.625 --> 17:24.500
- What?

17:25.625 --> 17:27.750
- Suppose someone walks by
and hears a group of kids

17:27.750 --> 17:29.000
talking about a body,

17:29.000 --> 17:30.583
do you think that might raise
some suspicion, dumb ass?

17:30.583 --> 17:31.917
- We live in the
middle of nowhere.

17:31.917 --> 17:32.875
Who do you think is gonna hear?

17:32.875 --> 17:33.583
- I'm talking precautions.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.333
- Precautions?

17:35.333 --> 17:40.000
It's a little late for
that, don't you think?

17:44.500 --> 17:45.375
- David.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.542
I think we should
hear Tyler out.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.333
- Like I have a choice.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.417
- What I'm trying to say is
we have to get rid of him.

18:00.417 --> 18:03.041
- [Carlo] No, we can't do that.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.709
- [Tyler] Why not?

18:05.709 --> 18:06.750
- Because they
always find the body.

18:06.750 --> 18:07.834
- [Tyler] What the hell
is he talking about?

18:07.834 --> 18:09.125
- [Carlo] TV, bro.

18:09.125 --> 18:12.000
Don't you ever
watch that cop shit?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.166
Like, they always find the body,

18:13.166 --> 18:16.625
they got the radar
and technology shit...

18:19.709 --> 18:22.750
(phone ringing)

18:22.750 --> 18:25.208
- Is that his phone?

18:35.458 --> 18:36.583
Shit!

18:36.583 --> 18:37.458
Oh, shit.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.417
- Who was that?

18:39.417 --> 18:41.750
- Dude, it was his mom.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.583
Don't those things have
like trackers or something?

18:44.583 --> 18:45.417
- No, idiot.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.583
I'm gonna go take a piss.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.667
- It's hot, I'm
opening that window.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.041
- Dude.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.291
Tyler just said not to.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.125
- Is he the boss of us or
am I missing something?

19:00.125 --> 19:01.000
- Stop being such
a fucking problem.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.291
- Am I being a problem?

19:03.291 --> 19:04.792
- He means we just need
to chill right now, okay?

19:04.792 --> 19:05.375
- Chill?

19:05.375 --> 19:07.166
Are you on his side?

19:07.166 --> 19:10.166
- I'm not on anybody's
side, we just need to chill.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.750
- You want a crack at this?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.417
Carlo?

19:14.417 --> 19:14.458
Scott?

19:31.709 --> 19:33.542
- Drive Carlo home.

19:33.542 --> 19:34.750
- Right now?

19:34.750 --> 19:35.500
- [Tyler] It's two
in the morning.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.750
We have school in five hours.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.500
- Oh, shit.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.250
- We just need to
get through tomorrow

19:42.250 --> 19:44.667
and we'll take care of
the rest on the weekend.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.375
- That's a good idea.

19:46.375 --> 19:49.959
- [Tyler] Someone cover his
body up with something, please.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.041
- You do it.

19:54.500 --> 19:54.542
- Carlo.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.917
That's better.

20:17.166 --> 20:20.166
- When'd you become
such a douche?

20:23.375 --> 20:25.208
- You cool to drive?

20:25.208 --> 20:26.375
- [Scott] Yeah, come on.

20:53.458 --> 20:57.625
(dark hip hop
instrumental music)

21:55.542 --> 21:55.583
- David.

21:59.917 --> 22:00.625
Wake up.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.000
I made breakfast.

22:20.834 --> 22:24.583
(knocking)

22:24.583 --> 22:26.041
Audrey riding with
us this morning?

22:26.041 --> 22:27.625
- Yes.

22:27.625 --> 22:27.667
Act normal.

22:29.834 --> 22:31.500
- Wait, shouldn't we
be going to the police?

22:31.500 --> 22:32.166
- No, we'll talk
about it tonight.

22:32.166 --> 22:34.333
- Come on, this is insane.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.542
- I said we'll talk
about it tonight.

22:36.542 --> 22:37.417
Coming!

22:40.208 --> 22:43.375
Don't forget to tell
Audrey happy birthday.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.667
- You're unreal.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.709
- You forget to eat dinner
last night or something?

23:03.208 --> 23:03.875
- Since when was it
cool to talk about

23:03.875 --> 23:06.041
a girl's eating habits?

23:07.375 --> 23:09.000
- Eating habits?

23:09.000 --> 23:09.875
- Yeah.

23:11.166 --> 23:12.333
- Just chill with
the drama, okay?

23:12.333 --> 23:14.041
I'm still waking up.

23:14.750 --> 23:19.458
(suspenseful instrumental music)

23:49.625 --> 23:50.667
- I'll see you in homeroom.

23:50.667 --> 23:51.625
- [Tyler] Where are you going?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.041
- Gotta pick something up.

23:53.041 --> 23:55.250
- What?

23:55.250 --> 23:57.542
- I'll show you
when I have them.

24:01.959 --> 24:04.125
I told you to meet me
after school off campus.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.959
- I gotta work.

24:05.959 --> 24:07.166
- You got a job?

24:07.166 --> 24:10.166
- Even I could salt fries.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.917
- That's good.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.041
- You proud?

24:13.500 --> 24:15.291
- [Audrey] Sure.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.625
- Say it.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.166
Tell me you're
finally proud of me.

24:21.166 --> 24:23.959
- Can I see the flyers?

24:25.000 --> 24:25.875
- Maybe.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.208
- Fine, I'm proud.

24:30.208 --> 24:32.375
- Thanks, babe.

24:33.125 --> 24:35.625
- So...

24:35.625 --> 24:35.667
- [Man] Oh.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.375
My boy Anthony hooked
us up with those.

24:40.375 --> 24:43.583
So thank him when you see him.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.041
- Thanks.

24:45.041 --> 24:45.417
- Wait.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.834
- Yeah?

24:46.834 --> 24:47.291
No, you can't, no.

24:47.291 --> 24:49.625
Okay, stop.

24:49.625 --> 24:53.458
(ominous instrumental music)

25:19.500 --> 25:22.083
(bell ringing)

25:29.834 --> 25:32.000
I got it.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.250
- Got what?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.959
- Tomorrow, I got the
place after it closes.

25:35.959 --> 25:38.417
Handing out the flyers today.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.250
- Roller Skate Rave.

25:42.250 --> 25:45.166
- You think it's
stupid, don't you?

25:46.834 --> 25:47.291
- Look.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.542
Don't freak out.

25:49.542 --> 25:51.083
- You think it's stupid,
it's okay you could say it.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.959
- No, I don't.

25:53.959 --> 25:55.667
I think it's cool.

25:55.667 --> 25:56.542
- Really?

25:56.542 --> 25:57.583
- For sure.

25:59.500 --> 26:04.041
It's just that I don't think
I'm gonna be able to make it.

26:04.041 --> 26:05.333
- It's my birthday.

26:05.333 --> 26:06.250
- I know, I know,
and I'm gonna try.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.208
I will, I just don't--

26:08.208 --> 26:10.375
- You're such an asshole.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.750
- Don't freak out, please.

26:12.750 --> 26:13.792
I told you I'm busy.

26:13.792 --> 26:14.875
- I'm not freaking out.

26:23.458 --> 26:26.250
- Didn't you just eat breakfast?

26:39.625 --> 26:42.959
(coughing and vomiting)

26:49.333 --> 26:51.834
- What'd I miss?

26:51.834 --> 26:53.917
- Nothing, we have a sub.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.291
Mrs. Holland didn't
leave any work so

26:55.291 --> 26:57.041
she put the TV on.

26:57.041 --> 26:59.542
- [Male Presenter] It's
completely unnecessary, Stacy.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.041
- [Stacy] But why oppose this?

27:02.041 --> 27:04.166
- They're talking about guns?

27:04.166 --> 27:05.041
- Yeah.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.333
- Awesome.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.000
- Always have been,
have a gun myself.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.458
What I think we
really need to do

27:10.458 --> 27:13.291
is to have a conversation
about our culture of violence

27:13.291 --> 27:14.709
in this country.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.792
Does it begin and end with guns?

27:16.792 --> 27:18.291
I don't think so.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.875
You see, owning a gun does
not mean you use that gun

27:20.875 --> 27:22.625
to commit a violent crime.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.917
In fact, many statistics
show that most people

27:23.917 --> 27:27.375
who own a gun do not
commit a violent crime.

27:27.375 --> 27:28.792
(gunshots)

27:30.375 --> 27:31.875
- Are you okay?

27:31.875 --> 27:34.625
- Yeah, I just wish they'd
change this damn channel.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.458
- Some would argue
that mass shootings--

27:36.458 --> 27:37.917
- Now let me stop
you right there.

27:37.917 --> 27:41.083
I think we need to focus
on identifying, diagnosing,

27:41.083 --> 27:43.959
and ultimately finding help
for people with mental illness.

27:43.959 --> 27:44.792
- So what you're saying is
that we should be able to

27:44.792 --> 27:47.917
legally obtain any
and all firearms

27:47.917 --> 27:48.834
no matter what the size?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.375
- That's exactly
what I'm saying.

27:50.375 --> 27:53.834
Guns don't kill people,
people kill people.

27:53.834 --> 27:56.083
(gunshot)

27:56.083 --> 28:00.291
Have defended their house
successfully against a break in.

28:06.709 --> 28:10.458
- Where do you
think you're going?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.208
- [Tyler] What the hell?

28:13.208 --> 28:14.500
- I can't believe
you're not coming.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.500
- I told you I can't.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.166
- Just cause Rich helped
me with the flyers?

28:19.166 --> 28:20.542
- What?

28:20.542 --> 28:22.000
- Isn't that why
you're really upset?

28:22.000 --> 28:22.417
- When did you see Rich?

28:22.417 --> 28:24.750
- Who cares?

28:24.750 --> 28:28.417
- He's your ex, why do you
have to see him so much?

28:30.917 --> 28:34.041
- At least he can make my party.

28:34.041 --> 28:35.709
- [Tyler] Whatever.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.625
- What are you doing?

28:40.625 --> 28:42.208
- [Audrey] Inviting more
people to the party.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.083
- It's overkill already.

28:44.083 --> 28:45.375
You got your cousin to DJ,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.083
everybody's gonna
come regardless.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.041
- I know, but still.

28:48.041 --> 28:51.458
- I'm surprised you
want a big thing anyway.

28:51.458 --> 28:52.458
- What do you mean?

28:52.458 --> 28:54.041
- I'm just saying, how
many girls are lucky

28:54.041 --> 28:55.041
to have a guy like Tyler?

28:55.041 --> 28:57.208
He probably doesn't want
to come to your party

28:57.208 --> 28:59.000
cause he wanted to do
something more romantic.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.917
- [Girl Laying On Bed] And
you're speaking from experience?

29:00.917 --> 29:02.041
Please girl.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.041
- You really think?

29:03.041 --> 29:05.500
- Yeah, and no offense but...

29:06.709 --> 29:08.083
If you keep acting like
you're not interested,

29:08.083 --> 29:09.875
he could lose interest.

29:13.458 --> 29:15.834
(vomiting)

29:31.125 --> 29:32.000
- Oh my God.

29:45.083 --> 29:45.834
- I just wanted one
last time to party

29:45.834 --> 29:49.250
before life gets busy, you know?

29:53.583 --> 29:57.166
(catchy electronic music)

30:00.125 --> 30:02.291
(gunshots)

30:14.959 --> 30:17.917
(somber piano music)

30:25.709 --> 30:26.625
- He's still not answering.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.750
Should I try again?

30:28.750 --> 30:30.458
- Leave Scott alone.

30:31.875 --> 30:33.875
- It's already suspicious.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.125
We're already suspicious.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.083
Why have we waited this long?

30:36.083 --> 30:39.792
- One more hour isn't
gonna mean shit.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.375
- [Carlo] What exactly are
we gonna say to them again?

30:41.375 --> 30:42.375
- The truth.

30:42.375 --> 30:45.166
We're gonna tell them
exactly how it happened.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.667
- Right.

30:46.667 --> 30:47.375
- [David] You do
realize they're gonna

30:47.375 --> 30:49.625
figure it out anyway, right?

30:49.625 --> 30:50.792
- I guess.

30:50.792 --> 30:54.834
- And when they do, any
credibility we have is lost.

30:54.834 --> 30:59.500
Which is why we're going
tonight, get what I mean?

30:59.500 --> 31:00.083
- Yeah, yeah man.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.208
- He's still not calling.

31:04.208 --> 31:05.542
- He'll be here.

31:05.542 --> 31:06.500
- Or not.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.834
What if he panicked
and skipped town?

31:08.834 --> 31:10.542
Or turned himself in,
that could make it worse

31:10.542 --> 31:12.000
for all of us.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.333
- [Carlo] He was acting
a little strange today.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.458
- He was?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.041
- Yeah, just...

31:18.041 --> 31:19.583
Really intense.

31:19.583 --> 31:20.875
- So let's just
get it over with.

31:20.875 --> 31:24.041
Come on you guys, we
can't wait for him.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.000
- Yeah.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.834
Whatever, let's do this.

31:29.834 --> 31:30.917
- Yeah?

31:30.917 --> 31:32.375
Okay, cool.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.542
I haven't had anything
to drink, so I can drive.

31:34.542 --> 31:35.875
- I'm driving.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.041
- Did I ever tell you guys

31:38.041 --> 31:42.291
about the time I
first got arrested?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.417
- Uh...

31:43.417 --> 31:44.542
No.

31:44.542 --> 31:49.208
- I was in middle school
and with a couple buddies,

31:49.208 --> 31:50.834
we were at the mall.

31:50.834 --> 31:54.333
Anyway, my friend Adam
thought it would be funny

31:54.333 --> 31:56.417
if I stole something.

31:56.417 --> 31:59.625
Right, said it would
make me "dope with him".

31:59.625 --> 32:03.709
So, like a dumb ass I stole
a shirt from Gemstones.

32:04.917 --> 32:08.750
The guard caught me before
I was even out of the door.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.875
They took me to Juvie...

32:12.417 --> 32:13.500
And booked me.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.333
It was only supposed to be
a couple of hours, right?

32:17.333 --> 32:21.583
But my mom was already out
getting bombed that night.

32:23.208 --> 32:27.709
So she didn't come get
me 'til the next morning.

32:27.709 --> 32:31.375
And even though it was only
one night, it was awful.

32:31.375 --> 32:35.125
I couldn't get any sleep
because I was afraid of getting

32:35.125 --> 32:37.792
fucking ass raped or some shit.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.500
- Tyler?

32:46.500 --> 32:46.959
- What if they don't
believe our story?

32:46.959 --> 32:49.291
- They will.

32:49.291 --> 32:50.417
- They can believe
what they want.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.625
Our fingerprints
are on his bike,

32:51.625 --> 32:52.959
his phone is smashed to pieces--

32:52.959 --> 32:54.083
- We'll explain it.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.500
- Would you believe
something like that?

32:56.500 --> 32:57.375
- Yes.

33:00.291 --> 33:01.333
- No way.

33:01.333 --> 33:02.959
- They can come up
with some story, right?

33:02.959 --> 33:04.458
They can say that we were
in a frickin' satanic cult

33:04.458 --> 33:05.333
or something?

33:05.333 --> 33:07.375
I've seen that
shit happen before.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.166
- [David] Where?

33:08.166 --> 33:08.959
- Places, dude.

33:08.959 --> 33:09.792
Fucking places.

33:09.792 --> 33:10.709
- TV?

33:10.709 --> 33:11.458
It's bullshit.

33:11.458 --> 33:14.166
- It's not bullshit, actually.

33:19.792 --> 33:20.875
We're gonna wait
for Scott before

33:20.875 --> 33:21.792
we do anything else.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.083
- Fuck that, I'm leaving.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.333
- No, sit down.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.417
- Why?

33:25.417 --> 33:26.417
- Whatever we decide,
it would be better

33:26.417 --> 33:27.709
if we're on the same page.

33:27.709 --> 33:30.208
- Well then where
the hell is Scott?

33:42.208 --> 33:44.250
- Hey man, where are you?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.125
Cool.

33:50.583 --> 33:52.041
He's five away.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.875
- Christ.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.667
- Are you gonna keep it?

33:57.667 --> 33:58.500
- Yeah.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.000
I mean, I love
Tyler and everything

34:00.000 --> 34:02.709
so who cares if
it's a little early?

34:02.709 --> 34:04.208
- Oh, for sure.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.208
Last year when I
thought I had Peter's,

34:07.208 --> 34:09.708
I was kind of digging it.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.542
- I'm gonna tell
him after the party.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.083
- [White Shirt Girl]
That's a really good plan.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.542
- Maybe you should tell
him in a text massage.

34:14.542 --> 34:17.542
That way he has
time to digest it.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.542
Or in person is good too.

34:20.708 --> 34:22.667
- The thing is...

34:22.667 --> 34:25.792
I know I'm in love with him.

34:25.792 --> 34:28.667
Okay, this might
sound silly but...

34:28.667 --> 34:29.875
He has this baseball
jersey that he

34:29.875 --> 34:32.208
always leaves on his bed.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.417
I love wearing it.

34:34.417 --> 34:35.833
He hates when I put it on,

34:35.833 --> 34:38.041
like it's some holy
garment or whatever, but...

34:38.041 --> 34:40.875
I just can't get enough of it.

34:40.875 --> 34:43.750
I think it's cause I just...

34:43.750 --> 34:45.708
Love the smell of him.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.417
I think I'm gonna go over.

34:51.542 --> 34:52.291
Things ended badly
for us today and

34:52.291 --> 34:55.208
I just feel like
I gotta see him.

34:55.208 --> 34:57.291
- [White Shirt Girl] Do
you want us to go with you?

34:57.291 --> 34:58.375
- Not tonight.

35:03.917 --> 35:05.333
- [Scott] Today sucked.

35:05.333 --> 35:08.125
- You should be a fucking
philosopher, Scott.

35:08.125 --> 35:11.709
- [Scott] I'm
getting sick of him.

35:11.709 --> 35:13.208
What do you guys
want to listen to?

35:13.208 --> 35:13.250
- Anything.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.458
- Okay.

35:18.458 --> 35:22.333
So, I looked some shit
up today online...

35:22.333 --> 35:24.542
You know how many kids
they sentenced to death?

35:24.542 --> 35:25.709
- How many?

35:25.709 --> 35:29.000
- Enough to scare
the fuck out of me.

35:29.000 --> 35:29.959
Hey is this okay?

35:29.959 --> 35:31.166
Is this good?

35:31.166 --> 35:32.625
- I'm sorry, what
were you saying?

35:32.625 --> 35:33.792
- Okay, like...

35:33.792 --> 35:36.125
I didn't know that
they can kill kids.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.792
But guys, they can.

35:41.709 --> 35:43.500
Can I hit that?

35:43.500 --> 35:44.667
- [Carlo] Yeah.

35:48.792 --> 35:50.917
- That shit's dank.

35:50.917 --> 35:52.166
- [Carlo] Yeah.

35:52.166 --> 35:53.458
- Where were you tonight?

35:56.583 --> 35:57.458
- Okay.

35:58.959 --> 36:00.959
So I came up with an idea.

36:00.959 --> 36:01.667
- Yeah?

36:01.667 --> 36:02.709
- Yeah, and it's a good one.

36:02.709 --> 36:06.834
So wait to say anything
until I'm finished.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.041
Okay.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.291
What if we recorded ourselves...

36:16.792 --> 36:17.875
Like on a computer.

36:17.875 --> 36:19.083
- [David] What?

36:19.083 --> 36:21.250
- Wait until I finish, David.

36:21.250 --> 36:24.125
Okay, three of us confess.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.208
Right?

36:25.208 --> 36:26.959
Leaving one of us out,

36:26.959 --> 36:29.875
saying that he wasn't there.

36:29.875 --> 36:32.375
And then we take these
four flash drives,

36:34.917 --> 36:35.792
and...

36:37.000 --> 36:38.709
We stash them away somewhere.

36:38.709 --> 36:39.667
- [Carlo] I'm confused.

36:39.667 --> 36:40.625
- Okay, listen, so.

36:40.625 --> 36:43.208
We take the four
different flash drives,

36:43.208 --> 36:44.875
and we stash them away,

36:44.875 --> 36:47.417
and then we get the guns.

36:47.417 --> 36:50.208
When do your parents
come back, by the way?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.333
- Couple days.

36:52.458 --> 36:52.500
- Okay.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.375
Okay.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.375
So we take the guns
and we split up.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.625
And then we kill
each other until

37:07.625 --> 37:10.166
there's only one man standing.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.709
Okay.

37:15.709 --> 37:17.959
There's four different
videos, right?

37:17.959 --> 37:22.208
Now on each one, one of us
is cleared by the others.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.959
So, whoever is
the last one alive

37:26.959 --> 37:29.208
destroys the other
three flash drives,

37:29.208 --> 37:31.875
takes the one where he's
innocent to the police,

37:31.875 --> 37:35.250
and not only does he get to live

37:35.250 --> 37:36.500
but he gets away with it.

37:40.208 --> 37:42.625
Okay, now you guys can speak.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.250
- You're a dumb ass.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.834
- [Carlo] Yeah,
I don't know man.

37:46.834 --> 37:49.875
- That is the stupidest
thing I have ever heard.

37:49.875 --> 37:50.917
Ever.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.291
- Okay, David, well maybe
you'd rather get treated

37:52.291 --> 37:53.750
with a little lethal injection.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.125
- Well I think this
new idea of yours

37:55.125 --> 37:57.417
is completely outrageous
and unrealistic.

37:57.417 --> 37:58.917
- Nothing is realistic
anymore, David.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.083
We're fucked.

38:01.083 --> 38:02.959
- And what, playing
some suburban version

38:02.959 --> 38:04.542
of Assassin's
Creed is your plan?

38:04.542 --> 38:07.417
- Well David, when you put
it like that it sounds dumb.

38:07.417 --> 38:08.750
- [David] Well, how
would you put it Scott?

38:08.750 --> 38:10.375
- Dude.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.166
I'm just trying to fix this.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.041
Or at least try.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.959
I mean I was looking
that shit online, dude.

38:16.959 --> 38:19.041
Like I even looked
up shit about people

38:19.041 --> 38:21.083
that cops wasted just
because they were in

38:21.083 --> 38:24.458
the wrong place at the
wrong fucking time.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.792
If you look guilty,
you're guilty.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.291
- You looked shit up.

38:28.291 --> 38:30.041
That's like going online
when you're a little sick

38:30.041 --> 38:31.959
and some website tells you
that based on your symptoms

38:31.959 --> 38:33.125
you have cancer when all
you really have is the flu.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.458
- Carlo, do we have anymore pot?

38:35.458 --> 38:36.417
- [Carlo] My body just
crashed into the wall.

38:36.417 --> 38:38.041
- Can I please hit that?

38:38.041 --> 38:38.542
(honking)

38:38.542 --> 38:40.041
- [Carlo] Fuck.

38:40.041 --> 38:42.291
What the hell was that?

38:42.291 --> 38:42.625
- Chill, okay?

38:44.917 --> 38:46.417
- [Scott] Oh shit.

38:54.542 --> 38:56.041
(knocking)

38:56.041 --> 38:56.917
- Tyler.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.333
Tyler!

38:59.333 --> 39:00.208
Seriously?

39:05.125 --> 39:06.166
(knocking)

39:06.166 --> 39:07.792
I know you're here.

39:10.166 --> 39:11.542
(knocking)

39:15.208 --> 39:17.250
You're still mad at me?

39:18.583 --> 39:20.667
- I don't have time
for this right now.

39:20.667 --> 39:24.667
- What?

39:24.667 --> 39:25.709
- Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

39:25.709 --> 39:28.250
- [Audrey] Looking for
David, have you seen him?

39:28.250 --> 39:30.667
- [Tyler] Why do you
need to talk to him?

39:30.667 --> 39:33.166
- I need advice on
music for the party.

39:33.166 --> 39:33.875
David?

39:33.875 --> 39:36.333
- Hey, you can't see David.

39:38.083 --> 39:39.709
- Why not?

39:41.083 --> 39:41.959
- He's...

39:44.041 --> 39:46.750
He's in his room with
a chick from school.

39:46.750 --> 39:47.875
He'd just be
embarrassed if he knew

39:47.875 --> 39:50.041
anyone else was here right now.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.750
- That's adorable.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.125
- Yeah, whatever.

39:58.166 --> 40:01.208
- You sure I can't stay?

40:01.208 --> 40:03.000
- Yeah, you gotta go.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.291
- Don't come tomorrow
if you're still

40:08.291 --> 40:09.875
acting like an ass.

40:15.166 --> 40:18.000
- Yes, but one of us lives!

40:18.000 --> 40:19.083
- So we just go at each
other like hit men?

40:19.083 --> 40:21.375
- What the fuck are you
not getting about this?

40:21.375 --> 40:22.667
- This plan!

40:22.667 --> 40:24.250
And Tyler, this is stupid.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.166
It really is.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.083
- [Scott] This is
seriously the best thing

40:27.083 --> 40:28.583
that we can do right now.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.625
- [David] You have no clue
what you're talking about!

40:29.625 --> 40:30.834
- And you do!

40:30.834 --> 40:31.709
Suddenly, you're
the fucking expert

40:31.709 --> 40:34.417
on what to do when
you kill a child.

40:34.417 --> 40:36.166
- No, but apparently
you are now!

40:36.166 --> 40:37.750
- [Radio Announcer]
Important announcement.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.458
Vegas police say
a 12 year old boy

40:39.458 --> 40:41.667
who went missing last night
still hasn't returned home.

40:41.667 --> 40:45.250
Bradley Holt was reported
missing this morning.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.417
His parents are urging
anyone with information

40:46.417 --> 40:48.792
about his whereabouts to contact

40:48.792 --> 40:51.250
the Las Vegas Police
Department immediately.

40:51.250 --> 40:52.959
- Holy shit dude.

40:52.959 --> 40:54.125
Oh we're fucked.

40:54.125 --> 40:55.875
- Relax, relax, we knew
this shit was gonna happen.

40:55.875 --> 40:56.458
- But now it's real!

40:56.458 --> 40:58.667
Now it's fucking real!

40:58.667 --> 41:00.041
Hey I gotta go, I
gotta get out of here.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.333
- Hey, no one's going anywhere.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.375
- [David] Carlo, let's
just take a breather.

41:02.375 --> 41:03.583
- Hey you stay away from me!

41:03.583 --> 41:06.291
- [David] Carlo calm
down, hey Carlo!

41:06.291 --> 41:07.250
- I can't do this!

41:07.250 --> 41:08.542
- What the hell man?

41:08.542 --> 41:11.041
- I don't want to go to jail,
I don't want to die like this!

41:11.041 --> 41:13.000
I agree.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.208
Agree with him.

41:15.917 --> 41:17.083
It makes sense.

41:19.083 --> 41:19.959
Fuck.

41:24.625 --> 41:27.375
I can't believe I just did that.

41:28.375 --> 41:32.041
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

41:40.834 --> 41:40.875
I'm in.

41:49.083 --> 41:51.583
Fuck.

41:51.583 --> 41:55.041
- Would somebody turn that
fucking thing off already!

41:58.000 --> 41:59.625
- David.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.750
It's our only option.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.667
- You're really gonna
kill your own brother?

42:16.667 --> 42:20.667
- I'd kill myself before
I'd let that happen, okay?

42:25.625 --> 42:30.041
But, you gotta realize
no matter what happens,

42:30.041 --> 42:30.667
our lives are over.

42:42.875 --> 42:43.709
- I'm spent.

42:50.375 --> 42:53.125
- What does that mean?

42:53.125 --> 42:53.667
- It means fine.

42:56.375 --> 42:58.625
Maybe you guys are right.

42:59.750 --> 43:02.291
Maybe I'm just in over my head.

43:41.208 --> 43:43.750
- [Tyler] This will
probably be good.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.500
Carlo, grab that, yeah.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.333
Bring it around here.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.333
- [Carlo] Sorry.

43:49.333 --> 43:51.542
That should be ready to go.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.291
- We killed Bradley.

43:59.333 --> 44:03.250
And now, I mean, as
you're watching this tape,

44:03.250 --> 44:04.792
by now we've killed ourselves.

44:08.166 --> 44:09.792
- Yeah, you make a
mistake like this

44:09.792 --> 44:12.250
and it changes the
rest of your life.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.875
- Dude.

44:14.792 --> 44:15.709
What life?

44:16.166 --> 44:18.041
Shit's over.

44:19.291 --> 44:20.792
- I had never even
met him before.

44:20.792 --> 44:21.417
- I knew him.

44:21.417 --> 44:22.875
We were neighbors.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.917
I mostly remember him just
running around his pool

44:24.917 --> 44:27.542
trying to get away
from his little sister.

44:27.542 --> 44:28.834
- No.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.375
He put us in this situation
by just showing up.

44:31.375 --> 44:32.125
- Not on purpose though.

44:32.125 --> 44:34.834
- It makes me so fucking mad.

44:34.834 --> 44:37.208
Honestly, I'd kill him
again if I had the chance.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.959
- Dude.

44:38.959 --> 44:40.125
- I'm just saying.

44:40.125 --> 44:43.417
- We didn't even know
he was coming over.

44:43.417 --> 44:45.333
Who's gonna believe that, right?

44:45.333 --> 44:47.500
- Yeah.

44:47.500 --> 44:50.583
- I want his parents
to know what happened.

44:50.583 --> 44:52.291
I want them to know
that we didn't mean it.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.917
- Of course we didn't mean it.

44:53.917 --> 44:55.458
But people are gonna
believe what they want

44:55.458 --> 44:57.417
which is why we're
forced to do this.

44:57.417 --> 44:57.834
- David though.

45:00.625 --> 45:03.041
That little shit is
so fucking lucky.

45:03.041 --> 45:05.583
He goes to his room
to make music right?

45:05.583 --> 45:07.000
To mix music?

45:07.000 --> 45:08.166
He didn't even hear
the gunshots go off

45:08.166 --> 45:13.083
because the music in his
phones is so fucking loud.

45:13.083 --> 45:14.125
And we didn't even tell
until the next day.

45:14.125 --> 45:16.959
- Tyler didn't have
anything to do with it.

45:16.959 --> 45:18.834
He said we were acting
like a bunch of tools

45:18.834 --> 45:21.333
and went off to
get some more beer.

45:21.333 --> 45:22.500
- And Carlo was with
us at the arcade

45:22.500 --> 45:26.625
but he left to go home
before we ever shot the guns.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.333
He had homework or something.

45:28.333 --> 45:31.667
- And even though Scott was
with us earlier that night,

45:31.667 --> 45:33.792
he wasn't there when
it actually happened.

45:33.792 --> 45:38.291
He got too drunk
and had to bounce.

45:38.291 --> 45:39.375
It was just the three of us.

45:39.375 --> 45:40.792
- But David wasn't there.

45:40.792 --> 45:41.542
- Tyler wasn't even there.

45:41.542 --> 45:43.667
- Carlo was never there.

45:43.667 --> 45:45.500
- Scott wasn't there.

45:47.041 --> 45:48.166
Drives are good?

45:48.166 --> 45:49.041
- Yeah.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.917
Now what?

45:53.917 --> 45:55.208
- We stash 'em.

45:55.208 --> 45:56.083
- Where?

45:58.083 --> 45:59.417
- Baby Jesus.

45:59.417 --> 46:01.166
In his basket.

46:01.166 --> 46:01.959
- [Tyler] What?

46:01.959 --> 46:02.542
- [David] No way.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.959
That's blasphemous.

46:04.959 --> 46:06.250
Put him under the camel.

46:06.250 --> 46:08.083
- Dude, what we did.

46:08.083 --> 46:08.959
That shit's blasphemous.

46:08.959 --> 46:10.125
- You're such an asshole.

46:10.125 --> 46:10.917
- I'm just saying.

46:10.917 --> 46:12.208
- Guys, shut up.

46:14.542 --> 46:16.041
It's going under the basket.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.417
It's a good idea.

46:19.667 --> 46:22.166
- You're right though.

46:22.166 --> 46:24.208
About what we did.

46:24.208 --> 46:26.208
It is blasphemous.

46:26.208 --> 46:28.166
Unforgivable, even.

46:28.166 --> 46:31.458
Even if our plan does work,
there's no escaping that.

46:31.458 --> 46:32.333
Ever.

46:33.792 --> 46:34.875
- Yeah, maybe.

46:36.291 --> 46:37.000
- Let's go.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.500
(haunting choral music)

46:39.500 --> 46:42.417
- Can I get a ride home?

47:06.208 --> 47:09.333
- I think it was a mistake
to cover him up like that.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.458
- What?

47:10.458 --> 47:11.625
- Bradley.

47:11.625 --> 47:15.458
It just seems wrong to
suffocate him under that tarp.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.750
- Suffocate him.

47:21.709 --> 47:23.875
I'm going to bed.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.208
(haunting choral music)

47:56.667 --> 47:58.291
- I couldn't sleep.

47:59.667 --> 48:02.333
- [Tyler] I feel like
my head's gonna explode.

48:02.333 --> 48:03.083
- Hungover?

48:15.125 --> 48:16.709
- Is that your gun?

48:17.917 --> 48:19.083
- Yeah.

48:19.083 --> 48:20.709
You might as well
take it though.

48:20.709 --> 48:23.208
Two's better than one, right?

48:24.542 --> 48:27.000
- I'm not taking it.

48:28.458 --> 48:30.583
- I'm not shooting anyone.

48:31.875 --> 48:33.041
Not my brother.

48:34.709 --> 48:36.417
Not my best friends.

48:37.500 --> 48:39.125
Besides...

48:40.834 --> 48:42.709
I'm pretty sure the odds
of us living are better

48:42.709 --> 48:45.208
if we don't gun each other down.

48:46.792 --> 48:47.667
- Right.

48:54.583 --> 48:55.875
We killed him.

48:59.917 --> 49:02.458
We actually fucking killed him.

49:04.417 --> 49:07.375
(crying)

49:21.250 --> 49:23.709
- Let's just call Scott
and Carlo and tell them

49:23.709 --> 49:27.959
that we're calling this off
and turning ourselves in.

49:30.959 --> 49:34.041
- What were we
thinking last night?

49:39.458 --> 49:41.125
Okay, I'll call them right now.

49:57.750 --> 50:00.792
- Is everything all right?

50:00.792 --> 50:01.250
- I don't know.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.458
You wanna go get some breakfast?

50:11.458 --> 50:12.875
- [Carlo] Yeah.

50:12.875 --> 50:13.750
- Yes!

50:17.250 --> 50:19.959
Wanna run inside first
and change or something?

50:19.959 --> 50:22.250
I'll wait in the car.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.041
- And listen to that
stupid bitch lecture me

50:24.041 --> 50:26.458
about not coming
home last night?

50:26.458 --> 50:27.333
Fuck no.

50:30.041 --> 50:31.709
- Is that Gail?

50:31.709 --> 50:32.125
- It's Pam now.

50:37.834 --> 50:38.834
Let's go eat.

50:38.834 --> 50:39.208
- [Carlo] Okay.

50:44.834 --> 50:47.375
- [Scott] Just get what
you want man, I got it.

50:47.375 --> 50:47.792
- You serious?

50:47.792 --> 50:49.709
- Totally.

50:49.709 --> 50:51.333
- [Waitress] What can
I get for you boys?

50:51.333 --> 50:51.375
- Um.

50:53.083 --> 50:55.834
I'll have the pancake egg thing.

50:56.709 --> 50:58.709
The coke.

50:58.709 --> 50:59.667
- Okay.

50:59.667 --> 51:01.291
- And does that come
with hash browns?

51:01.291 --> 51:03.583
- [Waitress] No, that's extra.

51:03.583 --> 51:05.208
- Is that cool?

51:05.208 --> 51:07.583
- Yeah man, get what you want.

51:07.583 --> 51:08.041
- Okay, yeah.

51:08.041 --> 51:08.583
Hash browns.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.709
- Okay.

51:10.709 --> 51:12.583
- And I'll take the
egg white omelette

51:12.583 --> 51:14.834
with spinach and mushrooms.

51:20.166 --> 51:20.917
Thanks.

51:20.917 --> 51:22.041
- All right.

51:25.417 --> 51:27.583
- [Scott] It's Tyler again.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.792
- Did he leave a voicemail?

51:29.792 --> 51:31.041
- No, a text.

51:33.250 --> 51:34.333
He said we all need to meet up.

51:34.333 --> 51:37.083
I just don't understand
why he's not texting you.

51:37.083 --> 51:39.667
- Well, I have no battery, so.

51:40.625 --> 51:41.542
- I don't know Carlo, dude.

51:41.542 --> 51:42.959
That's pretty fucking sketchy.

51:42.959 --> 51:45.083
Like why would he
need to see us?

51:45.083 --> 51:47.417
- Maybe he changed the plan.

51:51.041 --> 51:51.917
- Maybe.

51:55.583 --> 51:57.208
Carlo.

51:59.750 --> 52:02.917
Man, I just might
be paranoid but...

52:02.917 --> 52:04.208
Last night we all
agreed that this is

52:04.208 --> 52:05.542
the only way out, right?

52:05.542 --> 52:07.291
- Yeah.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.417
- Okay, well.

52:08.417 --> 52:09.333
Tyler wouldn't just
change his mind.

52:09.333 --> 52:12.208
Okay, he's too
fucking controlling.

52:12.208 --> 52:12.417
- Okay, so...

52:14.458 --> 52:14.500
What?

52:21.834 --> 52:24.041
- It's a trick.

52:25.542 --> 52:29.125
We go and see him, thinking
he's changed his mind,

52:29.125 --> 52:29.417
but he hasn't.

52:31.542 --> 52:36.458
He just wants to get us
when we least expect it.

52:36.458 --> 52:39.875
- Oh shit.

52:39.875 --> 52:40.750
Oh shit.

52:42.959 --> 52:45.041
Yeah, I think you're right.

52:45.041 --> 52:46.667
- I know I'm right.

52:49.375 --> 52:51.375
Holy shit bro,
he's gonna kill us.

52:55.959 --> 52:58.291
- He's not answering.

52:58.291 --> 52:58.750
- [David] And Carlo's is off?

52:58.750 --> 53:00.792
- Yeah.

53:00.792 --> 53:02.291
- Well, we have no choice then.

53:02.291 --> 53:05.917
We have to find them and tell
them that this thing is off.

53:11.166 --> 53:12.458
I don't want it.

53:14.709 --> 53:15.875
- Fine, but I'm keeping
mine on me until

53:15.875 --> 53:18.208
this is all cleared up.

53:18.208 --> 53:19.166
- Fine.

53:19.166 --> 53:20.834
And what about the confessions?

53:20.834 --> 53:22.083
We should get rid
of them, right?

53:22.083 --> 53:23.000
- Don't worry about
that right now,

53:23.000 --> 53:26.834
we need to find Scott
and Carlo first.

53:26.834 --> 53:27.959
- All right.

53:32.959 --> 53:37.125
- I'm sure they're just
at Scott's or something.

53:37.125 --> 53:38.000
- Okay.

55:42.083 --> 55:45.208
You know what word I hate?

55:46.834 --> 55:47.709
Stinky.

55:50.458 --> 55:50.917
Like...

55:50.917 --> 55:53.625
That's stinky.

55:53.625 --> 55:55.583
Or, you're stinky...

55:55.583 --> 55:57.542
(laughing)

55:57.542 --> 55:58.375
- Stinky.

55:58.375 --> 56:00.041
- [Scott] You know what I mean.

56:00.041 --> 56:03.000
- [Carlo] Stinky.

56:03.000 --> 56:03.458
- What's funny?

56:05.291 --> 56:06.458
- Nothing, Mom.

56:07.834 --> 56:09.291
- Is that my bottle?

56:09.291 --> 56:10.000
- [Carlo] You want some?

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
- [Mom] Okay.

56:12.000 --> 56:13.250
21?

56:13.250 --> 56:14.875
- [Carlo] You down?

56:15.333 --> 56:16.792
Let's play.

56:19.333 --> 56:22.041
- [Mom] You know what
they call a card dispenser

56:22.041 --> 56:23.166
in a casino?

56:24.125 --> 56:25.000
- What?

56:26.291 --> 56:27.625
- A Shoe.

56:27.625 --> 56:29.041
Isn't that funny?

56:31.125 --> 56:34.291
I like to feel them
though, the cards.

56:35.417 --> 56:36.500
More personal.

56:44.250 --> 56:44.667
- [Scott] Shit.

56:47.125 --> 56:48.625
- I think he bust.

56:52.250 --> 56:53.041
- Fuck.

56:53.041 --> 56:54.125
- I'll stay.

57:01.041 --> 57:03.333
- Flip 'em honey.

57:04.959 --> 57:06.083
(chuckling)

57:06.083 --> 57:08.542
- Push.

57:08.542 --> 57:09.417
- Push.

57:11.709 --> 57:16.917
Sometimes it's good not
to be personal, though.

57:16.917 --> 57:17.625
You get me?

57:19.834 --> 57:22.417
With the folks, they deal too.

57:22.417 --> 57:25.750
Sometimes I feel
like the Grim Reaper.

57:25.750 --> 57:28.583
Ruining all those
lives, those men.

57:29.792 --> 57:32.417
Betting money they don't
have or hope to have

57:32.417 --> 57:32.667
or never had.

57:35.667 --> 57:39.500
And I just sit there
smiling at them.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.917
Made me stop going to church.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.083
- I didn't know that.

57:46.083 --> 57:47.250
- Why?

57:47.250 --> 57:49.166
- It's too many sins.

57:49.166 --> 57:50.917
I mean...

57:50.917 --> 57:52.792
Gambling is a sin, fine.

57:53.959 --> 57:54.834
But...

57:56.667 --> 57:56.792
What I do...

58:00.166 --> 58:01.625
Shit, it's like...

58:03.417 --> 58:05.625
Driving a cab
straight off a cliff

58:05.625 --> 58:09.458
cause the guy in the back
said he'd pay the fare.

58:09.458 --> 58:12.667
And I don't care
what anyone says,

58:12.667 --> 58:14.792
some sins are downright...

58:16.333 --> 58:17.542
Unforgivable.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.875
- I need to take a nap.

58:25.875 --> 58:27.333
- You don't wanna
play another hand?

58:27.333 --> 58:30.875
- [Carlo] No, I
think we're gone.

58:30.875 --> 58:30.917
- Okay.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.041
Suit yourself.

58:37.250 --> 58:40.083
I'll be in the kitchen.

59:29.458 --> 59:32.375
(heavy breathing)

59:53.083 --> 59:56.250
(knocking)

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.250
- Hi, it's Leslie
from down the road.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:03.792
Do you remember me?

01:00:03.792 --> 01:00:05.125
Bradley's mom?

01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.875
- Yeah, I know who you are.

01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.166
- Have you seen Bradley?

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:11.709
He didn't come home
the other night.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.917
- I don't know, where
would I have seen him?

01:00:14.917 --> 01:00:16.083
- On his bike?

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:19.041
I don't know, he's
a good kid, Bradley.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:20.041
He always checks in.

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:22.583
He has a cell phone
but it isn't even on.

01:00:22.583 --> 01:00:23.750
- Okay, okay, please.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.792
I have to go.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:25.834
- You seen him, haven't you?

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:28.458
- I haven't seen him,
please leave me alone.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:29.792
- Please, don't.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:31.917
- I haven't seen him,
please leave me alone!

01:00:31.917 --> 01:00:33.750
- No, please tell
me where he is!

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:49.709
- [David] Hey.

01:00:49.709 --> 01:00:51.458
- Hey, where are you?

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.917
- [David] I'm home.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.542
- What are you doing at home?

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:56.834
- [David] I had to lay down.

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.792
Honestly, I'm kind
of freaking out.

01:01:00.959 --> 01:01:02.458
- Well, were they there?

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:03.125
- [David] What?

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:04.583
- Were they at Carlo's?

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:07.041
- [David] Oh, I didn't check.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.250
I'm really not
feeling well, Tyler.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:11.667
- Damn it, David!

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:21.875
- You guys off the
same time I am?

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:22.917
- Yeah.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:24.959
We're going to
Audrey's party, right?

01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:26.542
- We got uninvited.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:32.375
I think we should go anyway.

01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:34.625
- What were you thinking?

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:39.667
- Let's meet that
cock Audrey's dating.

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:41.792
(knocking)

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:49.041
(knocking)

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:57.208
(knocking)

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.083
- Wait!

01:01:59.041 --> 01:01:59.542
Don't answer it.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:01.125
They're after us.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:01.875
- [Mom] Who?

01:02:01.875 --> 01:02:02.750
- Don't answer the door.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.458
Carlo, Carlo, get the fuck up.

01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:06.333
Shit.

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:13.625
- Hi, Tyler.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:16.000
- Hi, is Carlo here?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.750
- Um, no honey, sorry.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.166
They left a while ago.

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:20.166
- They.

01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:22.458
Was he with Scott?

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.417
- What, he's always
with one of you.

01:02:25.417 --> 01:02:28.041
- They didn't say where
they went, did they?

01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:29.542
- Sorry honey, no.

01:02:30.458 --> 01:02:34.166
- But isn't that
Scott's car right there?

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:40.291
- I'm gonna tell them
you came by, okay?

01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:41.542
- I need to use the bathroom.

01:02:41.542 --> 01:02:43.709
- Tyler, sorry.

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:55.083
- My mom would let Carlo use
the bathroom if he had to.

01:02:58.125 --> 01:03:00.417
- Okay honey, just be quick.

01:03:23.959 --> 01:03:24.834
- Shit.

01:03:32.583 --> 01:03:33.458
Shit!

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:41.625
Fuck!

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:46.500
(honking)

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.291
- [David] And why do you think
they'll be at this party?

01:04:12.291 --> 01:04:16.166
- [Tyler] Because they
probably think we'll be here.

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:16.917
Damn it!

01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:18.750
- [David] What?

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:22.250
- I left Audrey's
gift in my room.

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:23.375
- What?

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:24.959
- I was gonna give
her my jersey,

01:04:24.959 --> 01:04:28.417
she likes to wear it all
the time for some reason.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.041
- Come on.

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:45.792
- [Tyler] David, get inside.

01:04:45.792 --> 01:04:46.792
- [David] No way.

01:04:46.792 --> 01:04:48.166
- David, go, now.

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:55.166
Just go home.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:56.625
- We have the right
to be here too.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:58.125
- Oh no you don't.

01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:02.542
- You don't tell me what to do.

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.041
I don't buy it.

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:25.875
You're a pussy.

01:05:25.875 --> 01:05:26.667
- Shut up, Rich.

01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:27.208
- Seriously man.

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.542
- You're a stupid...

01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:39.500
Pussy shit!

- What's up?

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:34.417
What is this?

01:06:34.417 --> 01:06:36.333
- It's a track I mixed.

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.166
- I don't want it.

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:38.959
- Here.

01:06:38.959 --> 01:06:41.417
Play it when you get a second.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.125
- Okay, what's the track under?

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:50.667
- It's in playlist,
it's called "Bday Mix".

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.625
- Okay, cool.

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.583
- David.

01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:14.458
- Hey.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.625
- It's Peter.

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:18.625
I played baseball
with Tyler last year.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.166
- Oh hey, what's up?

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.125
- [Peter] Have you seen Amanda?

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:22.500
She invited me.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.208
- I haven't seen her, no.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:26.250
- Yo, I came down from
college for this one.

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.417
- Cool.

01:07:27.417 --> 01:07:28.625
- [Peter] Not if
I don't get some.

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.458
- Right, yeah.

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:32.000
- [Peter] At least they
got a decent supply.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:32.875
- What?

01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:33.792
- Of alcohol.

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:35.083
Yeah, I just ran
into Scott and Carlo,

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:35.667
they're more messed up than me.

01:07:35.667 --> 01:07:37.917
- You saw them?

01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:39.500
- Oh I mean, more
messed up than I.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.000
That's some college
shit right there.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.792
- What, you saw them?

01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:21.417
(knocking)

01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:24.500
- [Man In Bathroom
Stall] It's taken.

01:08:28.332 --> 01:08:30.125
- Scott, Carlo?

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:30.750
- [Man In Second Stall]
Yeah, I got a girl

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.917
with a mouthful in here.

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:40.792
- Of course she's being
all nice to me tonight

01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:43.000
because she knows
we're best friends.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.917
I mean, I feel like it's
my birthday too almost.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:48.375
You know what I mean, Audrey?

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:48.959
- Uh huh.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.792
Have you seen Tyler yet?

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.792
You see him?

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:54.082
- Hey there, Peter!

01:08:54.082 --> 01:08:59.000
(catchy electronic dance music)

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:09.457
- Carlo.

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:11.417
Carlo!

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.041
- Dude.

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:16.082
- Carlo.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.417
Carlo.

01:09:17.417 --> 01:09:20.250
We've been looking everywhere
for you, where's Scott?

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:20.332
Where is he?

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:28.500

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:33.500

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:36.125
Shit!

01:09:47.207 --> 01:09:48.082
- Tyler!

01:09:51.332 --> 01:09:51.375
- Hey babe.

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.000
Happy Birthday.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
- I've been waiting
for you to show up.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.333
This is crazy, right?

01:09:58.333 --> 01:09:58.500
- Yeah, nuts.

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:02.250
- Why do you seem weird again?

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.083
- I'm not, I'm not, I'm sorry.

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:06.750

01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:23.041

01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:39.041

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:39.583

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:44.166

01:12:56.542 --> 01:12:57.208
I gotta get something, okay?

01:12:57.208 --> 01:12:57.542

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:00.917

find something to

01:13:00.917 --> 01:13:01.875
wrap the wound, okay?

01:13:01.875 --> 01:13:02.875
Do you have anything?

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:03.834

01:13:24.959 --> 01:13:25.542
- Why the hell did
you shoot Tyler?

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:27.333
- He had his gun on him.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:28.542

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:30.291
I'm fucking freaking

01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:32.542

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.709
- I don't know, Mexico?

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:34.458

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:36.542

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:41.375
Are you doing okay?

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.375
- Yeah.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.792
- [Carlo] Can I...

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:50.834
Can I tell you something?

01:14:50.834 --> 01:14:52.250
- Yeah.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:53.625
- You know Cindy Esposito?

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:57.750
- [Scott] Yeah.

01:14:59.041 --> 01:14:59.709
- I really like her.

01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:03.291
- [Scott] I know.

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:04.083
- I...

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:05.792
Really...

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.417
Really like her.

01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:13.125
On Tuesday we were
talking, right?

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.792
She told me I was shy.

01:15:19.417 --> 01:15:21.625
Why would she tell me that?

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.083
- Don't know.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:27.500
- I mean, you only tell
someone they're shy

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.041
if you want them to
open up about something.

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:34.458
You know...

01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:39.083
Maybe she wanted
me to ask her out.

01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:42.333
But I didn't say
anything, right?

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:45.166
I just kind of laughed.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:49.083
I was playing hard
to get, right?

01:15:58.166 --> 01:16:00.959
Maybe I wasn't
playing hard to get.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:04.917
Maybe I was just being shy.

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:08.792
Using it as an excuse.

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:12.875
- [Scott] It's an excuse.

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:17.959
- Yeah, probably.

01:16:20.625 --> 01:16:21.500
- Carlo.

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:24.667
I have to stop talking.

01:16:25.959 --> 01:16:26.000
