00:06.280 --> 00:08.760
Falmouth Coastguard
calling Angel Cove Lifeboat.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.800
Distress flare sighted
one mile west of Seal Island.

ALARM WAILS

LOW CHATTER

00:29.680 --> 00:32.840
Besides, what difference
would an early night have made?

00:32.840 --> 00:36.560
We're both on call day or night,
that's the whole...point.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.400
WHISTLING: What Shall We Do
With The Drunken Sailor?

00:42.400 --> 00:45.720
Right, what's the shout?
Red flare reported over Seal Island.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.760
Someone's in trouble,
that's all we know.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.720
What time do you call this?
The middle of the night.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.200
Jake, hurry up. Come on!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.640
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09.640 --> 01:12.320
OK, stay safe, everyone!

01:19.360 --> 01:21.840
Angel Cove Lifeboat,
this is Falmouth Coastguard.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.160
Can you give me your current
position, please? Over.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.200
Roger that. We're nearly there.
Over.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.960
Phillip, bring the lamp to port.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.320
Erica, to starboard!

01:42.040 --> 01:43.800
Hold on!

01:43.800 --> 01:46.760
Nice night for it!

01:46.760 --> 01:48.440
This is hopeless!

01:48.440 --> 01:50.320
Just keep at it.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.280
Angel Cove Lifeboat,
this is Falmouth Coastguard.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.160
Can we have an update on
your search, please? Over.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.040
Falmouth Coastguard,
this is Angel Cove Lifeboat.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.480
We have completed
a search and found nothing.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.160
I'm confident that it's another
hoax call. Over.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.720
Roger that. Happy for you to stand
down and return to station. Over.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.880
Turn her around! I'll get them in.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.760
We're turning back!

02:24.760 --> 02:27.200
Phil! Phillip!

02:35.840 --> 02:38.200
Erica! Erica!

02:43.960 --> 02:45.840
Time-wasting idiots!

Port-side!

02:57.480 --> 03:00.160
Erica! Chrissy?! Chrissy?!

03:00.160 --> 03:04.120
Falmouth Coastguard, Falmouth Coastguard, 
this is Angel Cove Lifeboat.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.600
We have two crew members
washed overboard. Over.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.880
Angel Cove Lifeboat,
this is Falmouth Coastguard.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.320
Copy that and standing by.
Do you require assistance?

03:13.320 --> 03:17.480
Repeat. Do you require assistance?
Over.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.800
Angel Cove Lifeboat,
are you receiving me? Over.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.840

04:46.080 --> 04:47.520
Can you take a photo of that?

04:47.520 --> 04:49.880
Just the rip, yeah? Yeah. Thanks.
Thank you.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.680
Chrissy? I'm Jane Kennedy,
the coroner. How are you feeling?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.840
Like someone just died.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.600
Look, we don't have to do this
right now, if you don't want to.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.760
Let's get it over with.
You sure? Mm.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.280
Could you talk me through
what happened last night?

05:10.280 --> 05:14.560
The coastguard reported
a distress flare just after 2:00am.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.480
So we went out on the shout,
but we drew a blank.

05:17.480 --> 05:21.320
There's, um...there's nothing
unusual in that.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.960
Around about half of our callouts
tend to be wild-goose chases.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.440
So...Erica was operating
the front searchlight

05:29.440 --> 05:33.680
and I went to tell her
we were turning the boat around.

05:33.680 --> 05:37.200
We had one last look to see if there
was any vessel,

05:37.200 --> 05:39.400
or bodies in the water.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.800
There were waves coming over
the deck and the next thing I knew,

05:42.800 --> 05:44.400
we were both in the water.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.720
And you don't remember
how it happened?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.600
No.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.080
How's your eye?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.280
Eh?

05:51.280 --> 05:53.440
It's quite a bruise
you've got there.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.360
Yeah. It's the least of my worries.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.000
Look, I've got a lot to do.
I need to be getting on.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.480
Chrissy?

06:00.880 --> 06:02.480
I don't think that's a good idea.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.560
SHE EXHALES

06:04.560 --> 06:07.000
Looks like an accident.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.600
Yeah. They were obviously
washed overboard. Then I found this.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.360
Oh, here we go. What's that?

06:11.360 --> 06:12.960
A small tear in Erica's life jacket.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.880
Almost invisible to the naked eye,
but large enough to prevent it

06:15.880 --> 06:17.920
from fully inflating when she hit
the water.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.360
Well, cases like this
are automatically referred

06:20.360 --> 06:22.760
to my friends at The Marine Accident
Investigation Branch.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.480
They're very thorough.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.920
The skipper can't remember
how she ended up in the sea.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.360
What if one of the other crewmembers
pushed her and Erica over the side?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.920
And what if, and this is just
a wild stab in the dark,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.200
they were washed overboard(?)

06:36.200 --> 06:39.000
OK, look, if you want a motive,
how about this?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.520
In January, Chrissy Woodward became
the first female lifeboat cox

06:42.520 --> 06:45.320
in Devon's history, and the first
thing she did was promote Erica.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.360
Oh, come on!
Davey, I'm serious! I know you are.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.960
But things have moved on,
haven't they?

06:49.960 --> 06:52.640
Ever since Emmeline Pankhurst
chained herself to them railings,

06:52.640 --> 06:55.720
we've got female police officers,
female world leaders.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.280
I believe we've even got
a female coroner.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.440
Jane, come on, no-one cares.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.320
What, so, you're not going to talk
to her? No.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.760
I'm not going to go looking for
trouble. That's more your department.
Thanks(!)

07:09.240 --> 07:10.760
Shut the door!

07:14.440 --> 07:16.560
Oh, yeah, I've known Chrissy
for years.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.000
I was her mentor
when she first volunteered.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.320
And what were your impressions?

07:20.320 --> 07:21.680
He does Sean Connery

07:21.680 --> 07:24.160
and a surprisingly good
Russell Harty.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.280
What that girl don't know about
sailing, you could fit on
a postage stamp.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.760
She was 17 when
she won Lighthaven Regatta.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.000
And within two weeks of working on
the boat crew, she was teaching me.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.840
So, you weren't surprised when
you heard she was the new skipper?

07:36.840 --> 07:39.640
Nah. Andy was training her up
to take over.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.080
His doctor had already told him
that he didn't have long,

07:42.080 --> 07:44.720
you know, cos of his drinking.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.280
Mind you, not everyone was pleased
with the promotion.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.400
Old Bob Fountain was spitting nails
when he found out.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.680
Why?

07:51.680 --> 07:54.640
Well, Bob's the longest-serving
crew member.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.160
You know, he thought his experience
entitled him to the top job.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.600
He wouldn't have been any good
at it, though.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.240
I mean, you need people skills
to run a boat crew.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.720
Bob may be many things,
but a diplomat he ain't.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.200
Oi! Go easy on the ham.
I don't know if I bought enough.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.960
If the mourners want more, they'll
have to buy it off the bar menu.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.880
If you don't mind me asking,
why did you quit the boat?

08:17.880 --> 08:20.760
I thought I was pushing my luck,
to be honest.

08:20.760 --> 08:24.480
You can only look death in the face
so many times.

08:24.480 --> 08:25.960
He failed his medical.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.560
They thought you were too chubby,
didn't they?

08:28.560 --> 08:30.120
ALARM WAILS

08:30.120 --> 08:32.559
Ooo, that flipping car alarm!

08:32.559 --> 08:33.919
It is useless.

08:37.880 --> 08:40.200
Oh! Mum, I ought to go,
if that's all right?

08:40.200 --> 08:42.000
It's all right, love.
Thanks for your help.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.680
ALARM WAILS

08:51.520 --> 08:52.760

08:54.120 --> 08:56.360
Oh! Oi! Oi!

08:58.200 --> 09:00.360
Mick! What's happened?!

09:00.360 --> 09:02.120
HE GROANS

09:02.120 --> 09:04.560
Did you get a look at him? No.
Who was he? I don't know.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.560
Oh, my God, Mick, are you all right?

09:06.560 --> 09:10.000
I'm going to call an ambulance! No,
don't fuss, woman, I'm all right.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.960
Let's get you up.
HE GROANS

09:15.000 --> 09:17.880
HE GROANS
Oh! Oh!

09:17.880 --> 09:19.840
BELLS PEAL

09:27.640 --> 09:29.320
Blimey, what happened to you?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.880
Someone clocked him one last night
in the pub car park.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.920
Who'd do something like that? They
didn't leave a forwarding address(!)

09:34.920 --> 09:37.160
Snuck up behind me,
like a thief in the night.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.520
Well, they probably were. Eh?

09:38.520 --> 09:40.360
A thief.
If they were in your car park.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.000
I told you he wouldn't take it
seriously.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.960
It's no wonder the country's
in the state it is!

09:43.960 --> 09:46.560
Well, I could take it seriously,
couldn't I? You ask Jane.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.080
I could take it very seriously.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.040
I could insist you install
some CCTV outside your premises,

09:51.040 --> 09:53.080
record any suspicious activity.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.120
Well, I mean, it's...
The only problem with that is,

09:56.120 --> 09:58.280
you might not like what we find.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.120
Shall we?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.560
Thanks, Davey(!) Cheers, mate(!)

Anyone who knew Erica Ryland
associated her with love.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.000
Hm! Hm.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.560
As her partner
for seven...unforgettable years,

11:38.560 --> 11:42.840
I was privileged to feel
the full force of that love.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.600

11:49.600 --> 11:52.480

11:52.480 --> 11:55.000
we were inseparable.

I'm Jane Kennedy, the coroner.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.480
I was wondering if I could ask you
a few questions about the accident.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.760
I just wonder if you saw anything.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.120
What were you doing at the time?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.720
I'm the helm.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.760
Right. So, you steer the boat?

13:04.600 --> 13:08.280
Let me guess...you're fascinated

13:08.280 --> 13:09.880
What?

13:09.880 --> 13:13.640
Well, I mean, your hair,
your clothes.

13:13.640 --> 13:16.000
You dress like someone just died.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.720
Someone just did.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.880
Ah! Good point.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.640
You OK?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.680
Oh, no. But thanks for asking.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.200
Can I sit down? Sure.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.600
I tell you, it was a catastrophe
just waiting to happen.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.160
Women at sea are unlucky.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.560
Especially if they're at sea
with you, eh, Bob? Huh!

13:41.560 --> 13:44.560
And a woman who whistles,
that's even worse.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.000
Now, that Erica, she used to whistle
in the lifeboat station.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.200
Well,
that's just asking for trouble.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.080
A whistling woman and a crowing hen
brings the devil out of his den.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.080
Oh, give it a rest, Fountain!

13:55.080 --> 13:57.680
No-one's interested in
your ignorant drivel.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.560
Can I get another one, please?
Of course.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.240
Oh, is that right,
Mr University-Educated-Car-Mechanic?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.520
Yeah, and...?

14:05.520 --> 14:08.440
I'll tell you what's ignorant.

14:08.440 --> 14:13.400
That's you pretending
you and Erica were inseparable

14:13.400 --> 14:17.840
when the whole town knows
she was sick to death of you.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.600
Bob? That's enough.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.040
This is neither the time or place.
We've lost one of our own.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.360
Erica was a loyal friend.
She was a brilliant second cox,

14:28.360 --> 14:30.680
and Phillip loved her.
So show some respect.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.000
That was Forensics.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.040
It turns out Erica's life jacket
may have been tampered with.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.200
So you do need to speak to the
skipper now. Yeah, looks that way.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.520
Chrissy?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.840
Sorry to bother you,
just a couple of questions.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.120
And I am sorry to have
to ask you this, but

15:01.120 --> 15:04.200
could anyone apart from Erica
have got hold of her life jacket?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.520
Easily. Really? Why's that?

15:06.520 --> 15:08.440
Well, we just leave all the kit
and life jackets,

15:08.440 --> 15:11.080
out on an open shelf
for ease of access, really.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.920
Um...you know,
speed is of the essence. Yeah.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.080
And I guess each crew member's responsible
for their own kit, is that right?

15:17.080 --> 15:19.400
Everyone,
including the apprentices.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.680
And would you say Erica was the
kind of person that paid attention
to detail?

15:22.680 --> 15:25.880
Absolutely.
So, can you think of any reason

15:25.880 --> 15:28.880
why anyone would want to damage
Erica's life jacket?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.880
Huh! Is that a serious question?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.920
Yeah, I'm afraid so, yeah.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.200
Absolutely not.
Erica was popular with everyone.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.960
What, even Bob Fountain?

15:36.960 --> 15:40.440
CHRISSY SIGHS
You can't take Bob Fountain
at face value.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.800
Look, he's an idiot on land, but
at sea, he's an absolute godsend.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.280
How'd you get the black eye?

15:48.280 --> 15:49.840
Oh, don't know.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.720
Could have been any number of ways.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.360
Yeah. All right, thanks.
I'll let you get on.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.760
Yeah. Cheers.

16:01.400 --> 16:05.240
Well, I have to justify
every new inquiry that I take on.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.040
As it stands, I don't have enough
evidence to launch
an initial investigation.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.560
You do, as the coroner, however,
have the right to investigate

16:12.560 --> 16:15.880
any death you find suspicious,
so be my guest.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.360
So, it's over to me?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.920
Yeah.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.480
BELLS PEAL

16:34.560 --> 16:36.400
CLATTERING

16:43.640 --> 16:46.040
WHISTLING: What Shall We Do
With The Drunken Sailor?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.880
Why didn't you phone me,

17:11.880 --> 17:16.000
instead of lying awake all night
worrying, you silly sausage?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.640
It's a bit lame, isn't it?

17:17.640 --> 17:19.680
I mean, what do I say,
"I heard someone whistling,

17:19.680 --> 17:23.000
"they tried the door handle
and then they went away"?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.119
It was probably just a drunk
not realising we were closed.

17:26.119 --> 17:29.640
Yeah, maybe, maybe not. What if
someone's got a grudge against me?

17:29.640 --> 17:31.640
Now you're just being fanciable.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.960
I think you mean fanciful. No.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.840
I mean fanciable.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.040
Would you like a nice bacon
sandwich? Would that make things
better?

17:40.040 --> 17:42.760
I think it might help. Mm?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.640
It doesn't work!

17:49.640 --> 17:51.800
Oh! Hm!

17:51.800 --> 17:53.720
Hm!

17:53.720 --> 17:55.800
Apologies for the inconvenience.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.000
What was that about?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.680
I bought a job lot of car alarms,
didn't I?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.680
No wonder they were cheap.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.800
Let me guess,
you installed one in your own car?

18:07.800 --> 18:11.840
How was I to know it was going to go
off every time a fly buzzed past?

18:12.880 --> 18:15.920
Luckily, these stun guns
have been selling like hot cakes.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.440
All the rage in Plymouth.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.920
That is my last one.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.280
Mick, that's a prohibited firearm!

18:21.280 --> 18:23.920
Oh, is it really illegal
to help protect the vulnerable?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.360
This is the sort of thing
you need in your line of work.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.920
Fully rechargeable.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.040
Just take off the safety catch
and press the red button.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.320
Peace of mind, just £35.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.480
KNOCK AT WINDOW

18:40.560 --> 18:43.080
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have
to confiscate this. Eh?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.640
I trained as a lawyer, didn't I?

18:44.640 --> 18:47.120
You can't expect me to look
the other way. Now, wait a minute,

18:47.120 --> 18:49.440
I take you into my confidence
and this is how you repay me?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.400
There are vulnerable people
out there!

18:51.400 --> 18:53.040
I hope you can sleep at night!

18:54.880 --> 18:56.480
Hey. Hey.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.520
So I've uncovered a couple of
interesting snippets

18:59.520 --> 19:01.120
about Erica Ryland.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.000
Apparently, her finances
were separate from her partner's,

19:05.000 --> 19:06.800
and she was in trouble.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.960
She had enormous credit-card bills
and no way to pay them back.

19:09.960 --> 19:13.320
OK. Well, there's a lot of it
around. Nothing else?

19:13.320 --> 19:17.160
Yeah. Last month, she went to the GP
complaining of nausea.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.080
Turns out she was pregnant.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.120
But when they carried out
the postmortem,

19:21.120 --> 19:23.320
there was no trace of a child.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.400
Thanks for taking the time
to talk to me.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.160
Oh, it's my pleasure.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.960
Do you want to come up
to the crew room?

19:31.960 --> 19:34.080
It's just a bit quieter up there.
Yeah, sure.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.120
Here.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.440
What's this for?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.200
Show me how to tie a bowline.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.880
Why? Don't know how?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.560
Course I know. I was tying
them before you were born.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.320
I'm trying to find out if you know.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.400
You knew Erica was pregnant?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.640
Yeah,
and I knew she didn't want to be.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.960
That's why she had the termination.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.040
She booked into a private clinic.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.040
I thought she was broke.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.000
I lent her the money.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.480
Well, she didn't have anyone else
to turn to and she couldn't

20:11.480 --> 20:13.240
exactly ask Phillip.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.000
Why not? Cos Phillip didn't know
about the baby.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.080
Before you ask, he was the father -
she wasn't seeing anyone else.

20:21.080 --> 20:24.400
She just felt like the relationship
had run its course.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.040
She was only living with him because
she couldn't afford to move out.

20:29.280 --> 20:33.160
So Bob Fountain was right,
Erica was sick of Phillip
and everyone could see.

20:33.160 --> 20:35.400
Everyone but Phillip.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.280
And what is that supposed to be?
Well, I...

20:38.280 --> 20:41.760
I didn't know how to do a bowline,
so I made you a rabbit instead.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.480
See, there's its ears and this is
its fluffy little tail...

20:45.480 --> 20:46.880
HE MAKES CUTE BUNNY NOISES

20:46.880 --> 20:48.360
Think that's funny, do you?!

20:48.360 --> 20:51.280
You are putting people's lives
at risk, your own included!

20:51.280 --> 20:53.320
All right, Bobby, don't blame me.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.680
Blame ickle wabbit!
Go on, get out of it!

20:55.680 --> 20:57.760
Go on, get out of my sight!
Whoa, whoa!

20:57.760 --> 21:00.240
Boy's only having
a bit of fun, Fountain.

21:00.240 --> 21:05.120
You're just too dim to see the joke.
Dim, am I?! I'll show you dim!

21:05.120 --> 21:08.920
Let me get at him, the stuck-up
ponce! I'll rip his lungs out...!

21:12.520 --> 21:15.960
Young Jakey knows I don't mean
anything by it, don't you, lad?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.560
CHRISSY SIGHS

21:25.680 --> 21:27.440
Maybe I'm in the wrong job.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.720
No, I don't believe that.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.280
You know, this wouldn't have happened
on Andy's watch.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.280
And nor Fountain when he was
here. No-one would have dared.

21:36.280 --> 21:42.120
I bet even Andy had moments of
doubt. We all do. Even you?

21:42.120 --> 21:45.920
Are you kidding me? I feel out of
my depth at least once a day.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.120
Twice on Mondays.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.240
You seem really confident.
It's pure bluff. Truly.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.960
See you later, Mick.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.280
Were you and Andy close?

22:03.520 --> 22:07.480
What makes you ask that?
It's the way you talk about him.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.360
Hmm... The skipper was...

22:13.400 --> 22:16.360
..was ever such a kind man.
You would have liked him.

22:17.560 --> 22:21.160
You know, the last thing he made
me promise was to give up drinking,

22:21.160 --> 22:22.480
and you know what?

22:22.480 --> 22:24.960
When I go home tonight, the first
thing I'm going to do is pour

22:24.960 --> 22:27.120
myself a stiff G&T.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.880
You still call him the skipper.

22:29.880 --> 22:33.080
Well, yeah. You're the skipper now.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.760
Remember that.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.280
Chrissy!

23:36.280 --> 23:38.520
Chrissy!

23:38.520 --> 23:42.120
Are you all right? Try not to move.
Are you all right?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.840
CHRISSY GROANS

23:45.880 --> 23:48.000
What just happened?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.080
I think someone tried to kill you.
Stay there.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.600
Davey, it's me.
You need to get to Chrissy's house.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.160
I think someone just tried to
take her life.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.320
OK. Bye.

24:07.560 --> 24:10.040
Count yourself lucky,
if you'd been going any faster

24:10.040 --> 24:12.680
he could have taken your head clean
off your shoulders.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.160
So you both think it was
attempted murder.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.000
Well, at the very least it was
a malicious act intended to

24:19.000 --> 24:20.640
cause actual bodily harm.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.080
One thing we can be sure of

24:22.080 --> 24:24.640
is the culprit knows you and your
movements.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.080
I'd advise you to be on your guard.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.160
Keep all your doors
and windows locked,

24:28.160 --> 24:30.000
especially after dark.
And I'll arrange for

24:30.000 --> 24:32.760
a police unit to swing by,
keep an eye on you.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.040
All right, I think we're done.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.680
You've got my number - call if you
need anything. Thank you.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.800
'This on top of everything else.'

24:47.800 --> 24:51.480
Come on, Davey, surely this is
linked to the death of Erica Ryland.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.400
Oh, really? You can prove that,
can you? No, but... No. Proof, Jane.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.480
We can't do anything without proof.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.320
LOUD RATTLING OUTSIDE

25:15.000 --> 25:16.960
Mick, are you awake?

25:16.960 --> 25:18.480
No.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.560
Baby, you're shaking like a leaf!

25:36.120 --> 25:37.680
OWL HOOTS

25:51.520 --> 25:53.240
Hello?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.200
DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE

26:03.120 --> 26:04.600
NONCHALANT WHISTLING

26:04.600 --> 26:05.920
Erica?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.920
Oh, it's you. Thank God for that.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.000
You nearly scared the life out of...

26:33.440 --> 26:34.760
Well?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.320
Well, what?

26:37.320 --> 26:41.160
Have you got enough grounds to
launch an initial investigation?

26:41.160 --> 26:45.560
He was killed with a spear gun!
The kind that scuba divers use.

26:45.560 --> 26:49.760
Isn't Phillip Spence a scuba diver?
Yeah, I know that.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.800
That's why I've got him down at
the station, along with the rest
of the crew.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.240
Waiting for me to give 'em the
old Davey Higgins third degree.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.800
INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER

27:05.160 --> 27:07.800
Clint, can you do me a
favour? Yeah.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.360
Could you research the lifeboat
crew? What, all of them?

27:10.360 --> 27:13.160
No, just the six that were on the
boat when Erica died.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.280
We're missing something,
I know we are.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.800
OK.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.320
So, Gobby...
Mind if I call you Gobby?

27:35.440 --> 27:36.960
Where were you last night?

27:39.280 --> 27:42.560
Don't shrug your shoulders,
my friend. We need an answer.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.160
Home.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.920
Can you prove you were at home?
My wife can vouch for me.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.960
Right. So your wife was with you.
No.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.040
No, she was in Oakhampton,
visiting her sister.

27:55.040 --> 27:59.120
Sorry? She phoned me, didn't she?
OK, what time was that?

27:59.120 --> 28:00.800
This morning.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.200
So how could she vouch
for your movements last night?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.880
When she phoned
this morning,

28:04.880 --> 28:07.000
I told her what I was doing
last night.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.720
Let's start again, shall we?

28:10.720 --> 28:14.320
And you were with your mum and dad
all night, is that right? Yeah.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.880
'Fraid so. How are they?
I haven't seen them for ages.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.760
Yeah, they're OK. Dad's started
playing his guitar again.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.880
Oh, that's good.
Getting any better? Well, depends.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.640
Depends? On what?
Whether you like Smoke On The Water.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.520
Honestly, that's all he can play.

28:29.520 --> 28:34.120
Well, that's no bad thing,
I suppose. Give him my regards,
will you? And your mum too.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.240
All right, we're done.
Cheers. Mind how you go.

28:40.080 --> 28:43.640
What? That's your idea of the
third degree, is it?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.800
No, I'm saving that for
Phillip Spence.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.280
Because if Spence knows that Erica
had an abortion and that

28:48.280 --> 28:51.920
Chrissy paid for it, it puts him
right in the frame, doesn't it?

28:55.920 --> 29:00.160
Did you know that Erica was
expecting a child? Your child.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.440
And, more to the point,

29:02.440 --> 29:05.720
did you know that Erica had decided
not to have that child?

29:08.520 --> 29:12.320
Because as a man and a...
a Buddhist, I believe?

29:12.320 --> 29:14.440
That must have been very
hard for you.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.960
Look, I can see where this is going.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.200
But I refuse to answer any more
questions until I've seen

29:20.200 --> 29:21.360
a solicitor.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.920
OK.

29:24.920 --> 29:28.720
Well, I researched the lifeboat
crew, just as you asked. And?

29:28.720 --> 29:35.200
And I must admit, I have rarely
encountered a less inspiring bunch.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.920
OK, so, Phillip Spence recently
passed an advanced driving test

29:39.920 --> 29:44.440
and is troubled by ingrown
toenails. Wait, it gets better.

29:44.440 --> 29:50.760
In 1987, Gobby Mitchell won
a pie eating contest in Paignton.

29:50.760 --> 29:54.480
And Jake, you already know about.
What's that supposed to mean?

29:54.480 --> 29:57.480
Well, you know,
just all the obvious stuff.

29:57.480 --> 30:01.160
You do know that Jake's big sister
was Leah Taylor, right? Who?

30:01.160 --> 30:04.200
Leah Taylor.
Davey's first murder enquiry.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.680
Sorry, I just assumed it was common
knowledge. Well, I...

30:07.680 --> 30:10.240
I wouldn't have been living
here at the time.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.160
So that's why Davey knew Jake's
parents. You think it's important?

30:19.120 --> 30:21.720
Of course I remember the case.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.520
Not the kind of thing you forget,
really.

30:24.520 --> 30:27.920
I'd...just joined CID and...

30:27.920 --> 30:30.720
what I wanted more than anything
else was to get my teeth

30:30.720 --> 30:32.640
stuck into a real murder enquiry.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.520
Be careful what you wish for, eh?

30:37.680 --> 30:42.760
Did you know Leah's family before?
Yeah, I knew her dad, Colin.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.760
We played rugby together
back in the day.

30:45.760 --> 30:49.040
We weren't exactly best mates or
anything, but...

30:49.040 --> 30:51.520
I liked him. He was a good guy.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.600
He's more of a mate of Mick's,
actually.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.920
Anyway...

30:58.200 --> 31:02.480
When they found Leah...
I had to go around there.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.840
With my ex-governor...
Break the news.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.480
That must have been hard.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.200
Yeah, it was terrible.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.240
He came to the door...

31:14.520 --> 31:18.040
With...with the little fella.
You mean Jake?

31:19.240 --> 31:20.800
She'd gone shopping.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.600
We didn't have to say anything,
really.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.880
He could tell from the look
on our faces.

31:28.560 --> 31:32.600
They say coppers don't take
their work home with them.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.840
Don't you believe it.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.840
What happened at the trial?

31:38.840 --> 31:40.920
Never went to trial.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.920
He was deemed unfit to stand.

31:42.920 --> 31:46.880
Oh... Mentally ill or
confused or something.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.080
Thanks.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.240
All right.

31:57.240 --> 32:01.840
Jane? Yeah. Do me a favour,
will you? Don't go bothering Jake.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.320
Not without good reason.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.200
Sure.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.280
One, two, Danny La Rue.
Three, four, Roger Moore.

32:17.280 --> 32:20.640
Mick. I need to talk to you
about Leah Taylor.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.040
That's the last thing
I want to talk about.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.440
Because you knew her dad?

32:29.360 --> 32:31.600
Mick, please,
this could be important!

32:33.440 --> 32:35.200
Well, if you must know...

32:35.200 --> 32:39.520
I was on the boat that picked up
John Barnes, Leah's murderer.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.640
Tried to drown himself, didn't he?

32:42.640 --> 32:44.920
Yeah, we fished him out
of the water.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.640
He tried to drown himself after
he killed Leah?

32:47.640 --> 32:51.280
No, two weeks before.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.400
That's what's so hard to take -
everyone knew Barnes was

32:54.400 --> 32:57.600
dangerous, he'd attacked a
girl before.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.160
If we hadn't saved his life
that night,

33:00.160 --> 33:02.960
Jake's sister would still be
alive.

33:02.960 --> 33:07.640
The night it happened, who...
who exactly was on the boat?

33:08.800 --> 33:13.720
Me, Andy. Chrissy...
Erica and Bob, yeah, all of us.

33:17.840 --> 33:21.680
Is there any way Jake or any of his
family could have known this?

33:21.680 --> 33:23.160
Don't reckon so.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.360
All it would say in the log is,

33:24.360 --> 33:27.720
"Swimmer in distress
rescued off Angel Cove."

33:27.720 --> 33:31.640
That's what they say when it's
a suicide attempt. "In distress".

33:31.640 --> 33:33.360
It's a sort of code.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.400
And anyone who'd joined the
lifeboat, they'd know this code?

33:36.400 --> 33:39.680
Oh, definitely, yeah.
Thanks, Mick.

33:44.960 --> 33:49.000
Davey, it's me. Listen...
I think I might know what's going on.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.280
Can you call me back?

33:59.400 --> 34:00.520
Hi.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.520
You talking to me? Yeah.

34:05.520 --> 34:11.120
My mum wants to know if you'd like
to join our quiz team. Your mum?

34:12.320 --> 34:15.639
All right...
I want you to join our quiz team.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.760
Why didn't you say so? Come on.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.520
Right, now, ladies and gentlemen,

34:28.520 --> 34:31.000
if I could just have your attention,
please.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could beg silence, please.

34:34.520 --> 34:37.719
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you all for turning up.

34:37.719 --> 34:40.360
Right, now,
before we get the quiz underway,

34:40.360 --> 34:43.000
I've just got something to say.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.159
Um...

34:44.159 --> 34:47.639
As you know, tonight was
originally organised as a...

34:47.639 --> 34:51.480
fundraising to get a memorial
for our beloved Erica Ryland.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.400
But, er, sadly,
as you all know by now,

34:54.400 --> 34:58.400
last night we lost another loyal
and long-serving member of

34:58.400 --> 35:01.880
the lifeboat crew, our old friend,
Bob Fountain.

35:01.880 --> 35:05.880
So now I ask you to dig deep tonight
as we help to raise money to

35:05.880 --> 35:08.920
put towards a fitting memorial
plaque honouring both those

35:08.920 --> 35:10.360
two lost heroes.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.760
Thank you.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.800
Now, if you'd like to get your
brain cells galvanised,

35:19.800 --> 35:22.280
have a quick sip on that sherry...

35:22.280 --> 35:26.000
and we'll start off with question
one of round one.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.720
Who wrote the novel Treasure Island?

35:28.720 --> 35:31.520
Well, I hope you lot know this one.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.720
Who wrote the novel Treasure
Island?

35:35.720 --> 35:39.840
Number two, Strawberry
Fields and Penny Lane...

35:39.840 --> 35:41.360
VOICE BECOMES INDISTINCT

35:43.240 --> 35:44.960
Gobby?

35:44.960 --> 35:46.560
What is it?

35:47.880 --> 35:49.960
I didn't know about the baby.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.520
Until it was too late.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.480
Erica has spent the night at her
sister's. At least,

35:57.480 --> 35:58.720
that's what she said.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.040
But when she came home I could see
she'd been crying, so...

36:04.040 --> 36:06.360
I asked her what was wrong
and she told me.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.720
I'm sorry.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.440
That must have been very
upsetting for you.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.520
I was furious.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.040
I called her every name
under the sun.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.200
All my Buddhist training
went out of the window.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.560
So when you saw Chrissy and Erica
together on the boat,

36:28.560 --> 36:30.480
that's when you saw your
opportunity.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.920
Wait, what's Chrissy got to do with it?
Well, I think you know.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.760
I assure you I don't.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.240
Chrissy lent Erica the money for the
abortion.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.400
HE SIGHS

36:45.400 --> 36:46.480
OK.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.520
That does surprise me.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.400
But it doesn't change anything.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.800
Chrissy and me were friends before
Erica came along.

36:55.800 --> 37:00.360
We remain friends now she's gone.
Really? Well, Chrissy must think so.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.920
Why else would she trust
me with Bobby?

37:03.960 --> 37:05.360
Sorry, I'm not with you.

37:07.440 --> 37:08.800
Last night...

37:08.800 --> 37:12.560
as I was getting ready for bed,
Chrissy brought her dog round...

37:14.000 --> 37:17.240
..asked me to take care of him in
case something happened to her.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.240
Well, that's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

37:19.240 --> 37:21.160
Well, that's what I told her, but...

37:21.160 --> 37:22.200
she was adamant.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.840
Even cried when she said
goodbye to him.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.720
I said... "Chrissy,
the police are watching your house.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.440
"What could possibly happen?"

37:32.840 --> 37:34.560
Interview suspended at 20:55.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.760
And question 10.

37:41.920 --> 37:48.120
Who played Batman in the 1989 film
of the same name?

37:48.120 --> 37:52.280
Once again, that is...
Oh, I know this one. Keaton.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.480
Buster Keaton.
..film of the same name?

37:55.480 --> 37:59.360
What's so funny? It was MICHAEL
Keaton. Yeah, that's what I meant!

37:59.360 --> 38:03.560
Write it down. Yeah, write it down,
Julie. You know my name is Judith.

38:03.560 --> 38:04.800
That's what he meant.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.880
You always were mouthy, Jake
Taylor, even when you were little.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.080
All right...Judith.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.560
Right, well, I hope everyone
is happy,

38:15.560 --> 38:18.680
and now, we're having
a short intermission.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.160
It's luxury fish and chip time.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.880
Enjoy!

38:24.120 --> 38:26.400
MUSIC: The Irish Rover
by the Dubliners

39:04.600 --> 39:08.200
MUSIC THUMPS INSIDE

39:08.200 --> 39:10.400
GULLS CRY

39:25.040 --> 39:27.120
HE CHOKES

39:28.120 --> 39:31.400
Seriously? Yeah! Seriously?
What's wrong with that?

39:31.400 --> 39:34.560
What are you two smirking at?
Nothing.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.720
Jake's got a crush on Chrissy.
Not any more.

39:37.720 --> 39:42.200
Like, when I was a kid. Oh, yeah?
How did you know her?

39:42.200 --> 39:45.080
Come on, Jake, spill the beans.
Spill the beans!

39:46.680 --> 39:48.840
Chrissy used to live next
door but one.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.320
She used to, um,
babysit for me and my sister.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.360
Mum, what is it? Have either of you
seen Chrissy recently?

39:58.360 --> 39:59.720
No.

40:01.280 --> 40:04.600
Why are you so embarrassing?
It was funny.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.280
HE CHOKES

40:06.280 --> 40:07.840
CHRISSY!

40:07.840 --> 40:10.080
Nearly there!

40:10.080 --> 40:11.720
GET OFF HIM!

40:11.720 --> 40:13.200
CHRISSY SHRIEKS

40:14.560 --> 40:16.320
HE GRUNTS AND CHOKES

40:16.320 --> 40:19.200
AAAAAGH!

40:19.200 --> 40:21.040
Mick! Mick!

40:21.040 --> 40:22.840
Mick! Say something!

40:22.840 --> 40:25.000
Please say something.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.560
PANICKY BREATHING

40:27.960 --> 40:29.360
Sophie...

40:53.640 --> 40:55.000
That was clever.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.280
The way you faked an attempt
on your own life to throw us off

40:59.280 --> 41:02.560
the scent. Well, not clever enough,
obviously.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.640
This is about John Barnes, isn't it?

41:07.600 --> 41:10.440
The night he tried to kill
himself,

41:10.440 --> 41:13.920
I said we should let him drown!

41:13.920 --> 41:16.640
Skipper overruled you, didn't he?

41:16.640 --> 41:21.120
That was Andy all over, always doing
the right thing no matter what.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.280
It was only at the end that
he admitted,

41:23.280 --> 41:26.080
he admitted he'd been wrong.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.160
He said that rescuing Barnes was the
single greatest regret

41:32.160 --> 41:33.680
of his life.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.720
I bet he didn't tell you
to go around murdering

41:35.720 --> 41:37.040
your fellow crew members!

41:38.640 --> 41:43.760
He said we were all guilty and that
amounts to the same thing!

41:45.840 --> 41:47.880
SIREN WAILS

41:53.840 --> 41:57.600
He all right?
He's all right! They ran that way!

41:57.600 --> 41:59.640
You waited till the storm
was at its worst,

41:59.640 --> 42:03.120
and when you saw your opportunity,
you dragged Erica over the side

42:03.120 --> 42:05.080
and tried to drown her, didn't you?

42:05.080 --> 42:06.760
Only she fought back.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.280
That was Erica all over.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.560
Even when I was holding her under,
she still kept fighting.

42:16.840 --> 42:19.080
Hit me so hard I almost blacked out.

42:19.080 --> 42:25.080
Well, now they're gone, it's my
turn. I mean...Fair's fair, right?

42:25.080 --> 42:28.840
Chrissy, taking your own life,
that's not going to help anyone.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.160
SHE EXHALES

42:34.160 --> 42:35.680
Chrissy!

42:37.480 --> 42:39.200
MUFFLED SCREAMING

42:40.720 --> 42:42.600
Chrissy! Chrissy!

42:44.040 --> 42:45.880
MUFFLED SCREAMING

42:45.880 --> 42:47.800
NO! NO!

42:50.160 --> 42:52.480
SHE SCREAMS

42:55.800 --> 42:59.080
So why were you following her?
I watch people.

43:00.440 --> 43:02.280
And, like this lady here...

43:02.280 --> 43:05.600
I may not seem much,
but I notice things.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.440
And she's been down
ever since Andy copped it.

43:12.240 --> 43:17.320
I was ascared that she might do herself in.
No, just everyone else.

43:17.320 --> 43:23.360
Oh, my big man! I really thought
I'd lost you. No way, my love.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.320
I had her just where I wanted her.

43:25.320 --> 43:28.680
Couple more seconds,
I'd have broken both her arms.

43:30.160 --> 43:31.960
724, please respond.

43:31.960 --> 43:36.320
So what brought you out here?
I notice things too.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.840
Yeah?

43:39.560 --> 43:41.360
Have you noticed it's your round?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.200
It's always my round.
