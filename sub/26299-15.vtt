00:13.180 --> 00:15.958
Do I call the nine and
the one and the other one?

00:15.990 --> 00:19.098
Why is my fridge filled with
non-football-related foods

00:19.131 --> 00:20.189
on Super Bowl Sunday?

00:20.222 --> 00:22.007
There's no room for
my Jerry Rice pudding.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.494
Haley's baby shower is today.

00:23.527 --> 00:25.312
I cleared it with you,
like, a month ago.

00:25.346 --> 00:26.933
Can't you just record the game?

00:26.966 --> 00:28.354
And what? Watch it tomorrow morning?

00:28.387 --> 00:31.263
Look. There's no reason a
football game and a baby shower

00:31.297 --> 00:32.719
can't co-exist under the same roof.

00:32.750 --> 00:33.710
[Sighs] Maybe you won't get in my way.

00:33.743 --> 00:35.061
Baby showers are pretty tame.

00:35.127 --> 00:39.363
Who's ready for a baby show-ahhh?!

00:53.579 --> 00:54.674
Mmm.

00:56.554 --> 00:59.926
I'm making White Russians
for the baby show-ahhh.

00:59.959 --> 01:02.802
A little liquid courage makes
all the naughty games better.

01:02.836 --> 01:05.184
I think you're mixing up baby
shower with bridal shower.

01:05.209 --> 01:08.191
Well, my bridal shower did
take place when I was pregnant.

01:08.223 --> 01:09.513
The cops even showed up.

01:09.546 --> 01:11.166
Of course, they weren't real cops.

01:11.199 --> 01:13.481
[Laughing] One of them rubbed
his butt against my belly.

01:13.513 --> 01:14.670
Don't tell Haley.

01:14.703 --> 01:16.456
- Or how about, "Don't tell Alex"?
- Mm.

01:16.489 --> 01:18.935
- [Door opens]
- Super Bowl squares here!

01:18.968 --> 01:20.621
Get your Super Bowl squares!

01:20.654 --> 01:22.076
No. Not this again.

01:22.108 --> 01:23.663
Uh, actually,
we've made some refinements.

01:23.696 --> 01:25.382
Last year, the price was a little high.

01:25.415 --> 01:26.604
The year before, too low.

01:26.638 --> 01:29.217
So this year,
we've landed on the perfect number.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.167
$3.75 per square.

01:31.201 --> 01:32.654
I'll do what I did last year.

01:32.688 --> 01:35.069
- Give me 11 squares.
- Okay. Easy enough.

01:35.101 --> 01:37.944
- Um...
- Uh...

01:37.977 --> 01:41.184
No. No Super Bowl math
on the baby shower side.

01:41.218 --> 01:42.770
Go over there.

01:42.804 --> 01:44.886
I'm telling you, you look cute.

01:44.919 --> 01:47.300
You know what's not cute? Lying to me.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.415
This gets better once
they come out, right?

01:49.449 --> 01:51.862
- What happened?
- Well, my last pair of jeans exploded,

01:51.895 --> 01:54.210
I can't wear skirts because
my thighs are growing hair

01:54.242 --> 01:55.499
faster than I can shave it,

01:55.531 --> 01:57.780
so I'm wearing ski pants
to my own baby shower.

01:58.381 --> 02:00.523
- I'm telling you, no one's even gonna notice.
- Oh...

02:00.557 --> 02:02.839
[Swishing]

02:02.871 --> 02:05.814
What's that sound? It's like when the
doors on the starship Enterprise open.

02:05.847 --> 02:07.896
Hey, you guys want to buy
a Super Bowl square?

02:07.929 --> 02:09.185
Only $3.75.

02:09.217 --> 02:10.739
Dylan: Cool. Can I take three squares?

02:10.773 --> 02:12.325
Yeah, I need something good today, too.

02:12.359 --> 02:14.144
We'll split five squares.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.128
Uh... do you have quarters?

02:16.161 --> 02:17.318
Dylan: Oh, I don't carry change

02:17.351 --> 02:19.433
since the last time
I got struck by lightning.

02:19.466 --> 02:21.053
[Door opens]

02:22.938 --> 02:24.425
Hello, Phillip.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.546
Hello, Manuel.

02:26.578 --> 02:28.033
Against my better judgment,

02:28.066 --> 02:30.281
I wrote a part for Phil in my new movie.

02:30.315 --> 02:32.992
Things got heated, words were exchanged,

02:33.024 --> 02:35.868
which is surprising, considering
he had a mouthful of scenery.

02:35.901 --> 02:37.158
[Scoffs] Actors.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.471
Writers. They think they're so great.

02:39.504 --> 02:41.257
"Oh, my words are so precious."

02:41.290 --> 02:42.777
Try listening for once.

02:42.810 --> 02:45.489
Maybe you'll learn how
humans actually talk.

02:45.521 --> 02:47.703
Wait, is it... is it "talk" or "speak"?

02:47.736 --> 02:49.191
Oh, that's right.

02:49.224 --> 02:50.944
No one cares!

02:51.650 --> 02:53.984
Hello, hello.
I'm here for the Super Bowl.

02:54.018 --> 02:55.637
- And I am here for the baby shower.
- Okay, yep.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.687
- [Door closes]
- I'm here for some sort of punishment, I think.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.331
Hmm. Lily and her friend,
Christina, got into a huge fight.

03:00.365 --> 03:03.472
And I was hoping we could have the
girls sit down and talk it out.

03:03.505 --> 03:05.389
But Mitchell said "no,"
Christina's in the wrong.

03:05.423 --> 03:07.770
And apparently, Mitchell's the law.

03:07.804 --> 03:11.176
He is. Lily, you're very lucky
to have such a wise papa.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.580
- Mm-hmm.
- Assistant District Attorney Pritchett is a hero.

03:14.613 --> 03:17.294
Huh. So this one thinks you're cool now?

03:17.358 --> 03:19.540
Okay, Gloria loves crime stories,

03:19.573 --> 03:21.127
especially women who
kill their husbands.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.564
And I recently prosecuted
the Bel Air Black Widow.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.416
She came to court every single day.

03:26.449 --> 03:29.226
We find the defendant guilty.

03:29.259 --> 03:31.276
Yes! Whoop, whoop!

03:31.308 --> 03:33.986
Hey, Counselor. This isn't over.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.904
Lady, you're like me in high school,

03:35.936 --> 03:38.218
cause you ain't gonna be
coming out for 17 years!

03:38.251 --> 03:40.598
Gloria: Boom goes the dynamite!

03:42.218 --> 03:45.193
Cam, have a bowl of my famous chili.

03:45.227 --> 03:47.375
I didn't know you made chili.

03:47.409 --> 03:49.293
I know all about Jay's damn chili.

03:49.326 --> 03:51.772
We talked about it last
year on this very day.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.491
[Voice breaking] Promises were made.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.640
- [Crowd cheering]
- Next year, I'm getting you your own football chair

03:55.673 --> 03:57.723
and you're gonna help
me make my famous chili.

03:57.755 --> 03:59.244
5:00 a.m.

03:59.276 --> 04:02.120
Be there or be square.

04:02.383 --> 04:04.564
You know,
I never entirely felt Jay's approval,

04:04.598 --> 04:06.218
so this was a big step for us.

04:06.251 --> 04:07.408
I counted the days.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.697
Then Super Bowl Eve,

04:08.730 --> 04:11.045
I went and I bought the
finest chili thickeners...

04:11.078 --> 04:13.193
corn flour and potato flour.

04:13.227 --> 04:15.639
And I showed up an hour before dawn.

04:16.293 --> 04:19.276
I called Jay's cell as
to not startle Gloria.

04:19.309 --> 04:20.697
Jay: [Yawning] Hey, what's up?

04:20.730 --> 04:23.343
He had no idea why I was calling.

04:23.375 --> 04:26.120
Clearly promises made
didn't mean as much to him.

04:26.152 --> 04:27.573
But I couldn't let him know that.

04:27.607 --> 04:29.722
Oh, uh, Jay, is th... is that you?

04:29.756 --> 04:32.334
I-I must... I must've butt-dialed you.

04:32.368 --> 04:33.822
Why else would I be
calling you so early...

04:33.856 --> 04:35.707
[Voice breaking] ...on a
regular Sunday morning?

04:35.740 --> 04:36.963
- Sorry.
- [Cellphone beeps]

04:36.996 --> 04:38.450
I felt like a jilted lover

04:38.483 --> 04:43.144
standing on his porch,
holding those beautiful flours.

04:43.178 --> 04:46.451
- Oh.
- You can't hide in here all day.

04:46.483 --> 04:47.773
To me, you've never been hotter,

04:47.806 --> 04:49.591
and I've seen you hitchhike in a bikini.

04:49.625 --> 04:50.781
There you are.

04:50.815 --> 04:52.666
I'm sorry you're having a bad day, uh...

04:52.700 --> 04:56.236
but I thought you should know,
I invited Danielle.

04:56.269 --> 04:58.683
Danielle? Ugh, she's so annoying.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.459
Everything she says [as
Danielle] sounds like a question?

05:01.493 --> 05:02.749
But it's not?

05:02.782 --> 05:04.434
Yeah, but she's in her, like,

05:04.468 --> 05:06.716
thousandth month of pregnancy.

05:06.749 --> 05:07.873
Oh, my God.

05:07.906 --> 05:09.262
That means I won't be
the grossest preggo here.

05:09.294 --> 05:12.005
Bless you. Oh.

05:12.039 --> 05:13.527
Thanks.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.311
And thanks for inviting me today.

05:15.344 --> 05:17.328
Of course. You're the baby's father.

05:17.361 --> 05:18.848
Yeah, but it's a family thing,

05:18.882 --> 05:20.667
and I don't always feel like I belong.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.906
Sometimes they look at me like the
proverbial bird in the punch bowl.

05:23.940 --> 05:24.898
[Chuckles]

05:24.932 --> 05:26.882
Almost.

05:26.915 --> 05:28.434
Luke: Uh, three times...

05:28.467 --> 05:31.061
I'm sorry, but every way you look at it,
Dylan comes up short.

05:31.075 --> 05:33.988
And Haley's totally getting rooked.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.761
Oh! Okay, well, that's interesting.

05:35.805 --> 05:37.948
Um, they lost track of the
Black Widow at the county jail.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.058
- She escaped?
- Mm-hmm.

05:40.091 --> 05:42.141
- Are you scared?
- What?!

05:42.174 --> 05:43.728
Exactly!

05:43.761 --> 05:45.447
- She should be scared of you.
- Mm.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.017
If she's smart, that young
lady will run and keep running.

05:49.050 --> 05:51.398
Mm-hmm.

05:51.431 --> 05:53.976
[Smacking lips] What spice is in here?

05:54.009 --> 05:55.596
Is it... Is that dill?

05:55.630 --> 05:56.885
Why the hell is dill in here?

05:56.919 --> 05:58.638
It's a... It's a catastrophe.

06:04.324 --> 06:06.605
So, I'm just gonna
repurpose some of this hair

06:06.638 --> 06:08.588
to cover the bald spot and zits...

06:08.622 --> 06:12.225
- Zits?!
- And "zits" gonna look amazing.

06:12.258 --> 06:13.712
Ta da!

06:13.745 --> 06:15.201
- Ta da?!
- Yeah.

06:15.233 --> 06:16.884
I have a huge gut and a comb-over.

06:16.957 --> 06:19.139
I look like a divorced dentist.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.759
[Doorbell rings]

06:20.792 --> 06:22.247
Oh, Danielle!

06:22.279 --> 06:24.527
You look so good. Why?

06:24.560 --> 06:27.370
It's the magic of pregnancy? #Blessed?

06:27.404 --> 06:28.829
What the hell?!

06:28.885 --> 06:31.139
Alex said it was okay if I came early?

06:31.173 --> 06:33.515
Haley, I'm so happy for you?

06:33.613 --> 06:35.470
I need Dylan. Where is Dylan?

06:35.503 --> 06:36.891
Where's Dylan?

06:38.097 --> 06:40.230
Haley's not gonna find Dylan.

06:40.263 --> 06:41.289
He's gone,

06:41.321 --> 06:43.337
and it's everybody's fault!

06:45.123 --> 06:47.173
What is up with all the funeral faces?

06:47.206 --> 06:48.562
Come on, people, this is supposed to be

06:48.595 --> 06:50.346
- a baby show-ahhh.
- Don't say "show-ahhh".

06:50.380 --> 06:52.271
Nobody wants it.

06:53.629 --> 06:55.932
Okay. So, Dylan misunderstood

06:55.965 --> 06:58.434
a bunch of the things he heard us say,
got upset, and ran off.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.536
Let's not pretend this was some mistake

07:00.569 --> 07:02.638
or Dylan being oversensitive.

07:02.671 --> 07:05.708
We've all given him plenty of reasons
to feel unwelcome in this family.

07:05.741 --> 07:08.211
And some of us do have a meanness.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.914
I'll leave it at that.
A monstrous cruelty.

07:10.947 --> 07:12.268
Enough said. Sadistic.

07:12.282 --> 07:14.083
My family is really chill?

07:14.117 --> 07:15.419
[Scoffs] You were a mistake.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.486
Okay, Haley's being occupied by Luke,

07:17.519 --> 07:18.690
so we have some time.

07:18.722 --> 07:19.925
We just have to find Dylan

07:19.958 --> 07:22.202
without letting Haley
know he's run away.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.088
That kind of sounds like
a shower problem, though.

07:24.121 --> 07:25.326
I don't know how fair it is to bring in

07:25.358 --> 07:27.081
- the Super Bowl folk into this.
- Hey!

07:27.113 --> 07:30.985
My big sister gave me the
honor of hosting her shower,

07:31.017 --> 07:33.099
and it's gonna be great.

07:33.132 --> 07:34.725
So, the one person

07:34.757 --> 07:36.384
who might know where Dylan went, Haley,

07:36.416 --> 07:38.628
is the one person who
can't know he's missing.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.255
That's what I call a dramatic situation.

07:40.287 --> 07:41.093
[Chuckles]

07:41.106 --> 07:43.030
Shouldn't you be directing
the life out of it?

07:43.073 --> 07:45.627
Joe, where does Dylan like
to go when he's depressed?

07:45.660 --> 07:47.892
Alex, he likes him, but it's not like...

07:47.925 --> 07:49.823
Park, pet store, guitar shop.

07:51.026 --> 07:52.848
What? I follow his Instagram.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.500
He finds beauty in the mundane.

07:54.518 --> 07:57.012
Okay. We'll search for Dylan in teams.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.029
- Mitch, Gloria... park.
- Score.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.143
- Guitar store... Cam, Jay.
- Um...

08:01.175 --> 08:03.192
And the pet store... Phil, Manny, go.

08:03.224 --> 08:04.850
- Actually, could I trade?
- Your pretty face

08:04.884 --> 08:06.998
for one that's been freshly whooped?
Try me!

08:07.030 --> 08:08.332
Would it be possible if I could...

08:08.364 --> 08:10.381
- Move!
- Ah, they'll have a bathroom at the store.

08:13.937 --> 08:15.878
He's not stuck in the tube slide.

08:15.910 --> 08:17.212
Ah, it was too much to hope he'd be

08:17.244 --> 08:19.163
where we found him when
Mister Rogers died.

08:19.195 --> 08:21.439
- [Cellphone chimes]
- Oh.

08:21.473 --> 08:23.099
[Chuckles]
"You messed with the wrong girl.

08:23.131 --> 08:24.172
I'm coming for you."

08:24.204 --> 08:25.213
Who is this?

08:25.245 --> 08:26.449
310.

17:26.814 --> 17:29.491
I do think it's the end of the
road for me as a thespian, though.

17:29.524 --> 17:30.960
- Probably best.
- [Chuckles]

17:30.994 --> 17:33.604
Well, I did have a part in my
next film for a guy your age,

17:33.637 --> 17:36.184
but you'd have to grow
a Fu Manchu moustache

17:36.216 --> 17:37.751
and gain 40 pounds in two weeks.

17:37.783 --> 17:39.611
I'll be ready Tuesday.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.341
- Cilantro.
- Yes.

17:41.374 --> 17:43.725
- Diced red onion?
- You are good.

17:43.757 --> 17:45.160
Hey, don't run away
with the rest of that.

17:45.193 --> 17:47.609
- Ugh, what am I looking at?
- Mmm.

17:47.642 --> 17:50.689
Mitch, come here.
Show them how to be a real man.

17:50.790 --> 17:54.627
He has been getting
threatening texts all day

17:54.660 --> 17:58.121
from a fugitive,
and he hasn't even flinched.

17:58.201 --> 18:00.569
Well, they're lucky
they're pretty, right?

18:00.601 --> 18:01.478
[Chuckles]

18:01.510 --> 18:03.665
Daddy, can I borrow your phone?

18:03.698 --> 18:05.951
I want to apologize to Christina.

18:05.983 --> 18:08.333
Lily, no. His phone might be evidence

18:08.366 --> 18:11.076
- in a murder trial.
- Whose?

18:11.108 --> 18:14.014
Sweetie, have you been using
Daddy's phone to text your friend?

18:14.046 --> 18:15.482
Yeah, and I said some mean stuff.

18:15.514 --> 18:18.094
She's probably been texting me back.

18:18.127 --> 18:20.739
- [Cellphone dings]
- My God. Okay, okay.

18:20.771 --> 18:22.566
"I'm... I'm right outside your house.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.709
This ends now."

18:23.741 --> 18:25.373
- [Cellphone dings]
- Oh!

18:25.405 --> 18:26.647
"P.S., your hair's ugly."

18:26.679 --> 18:28.965
It's a bluff. She's not out there.

18:28.997 --> 18:30.923
I mean, if you want to go check, check.

18:30.956 --> 18:33.437
You know, us weaklings
would feel so much better

18:33.470 --> 18:35.884
- if you would just take a quick look.
- Please.

18:35.918 --> 18:37.843
Well, as... as lawman and protector,

18:37.876 --> 18:40.912
that is something that I... I can do.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.636
- Hey.
- Ohh!

18:47.669 --> 18:49.269
[Both screaming]

18:49.301 --> 18:51.554
[Breathing rapidly, squeaking]

18:52.322 --> 18:53.773
Thank you for this, Dylan,

18:53.806 --> 18:56.026
and I appreciate you forgiving me

18:56.059 --> 18:58.181
for the dumb thing I said earlier.

18:58.213 --> 18:59.226
Who said I forgave you?

18:59.258 --> 19:00.531
I'm only treating your injury

19:00.563 --> 19:03.632
because you're a guest in my home.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.831
I know it may seem that
I haven't always accepted you,

19:06.865 --> 19:08.529
but when I met you,

19:08.561 --> 19:10.520
you were an 18-year-old
in a leather jacket

19:10.553 --> 19:12.773
dating my 15-year-old daughter.

19:12.805 --> 19:13.818
I get it.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.220
You were trying to protect your daughter

19:15.253 --> 19:16.200
from a guy like me,

19:16.232 --> 19:17.343
but I haven't been a guy like me

19:17.375 --> 19:18.746
- for a long time.
- [Sighs]

19:18.779 --> 19:19.791
Bend for me.

19:19.824 --> 19:20.835
It's hard, Dylan.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.729
I have been a mama bear for so long...

19:22.785 --> 19:25.504
- No, your elbow.
- Oh.

19:25.536 --> 19:26.728
[Quietly] Okay.

19:26.854 --> 19:29.943
It's j... It's all happening so fast.

19:29.976 --> 19:31.412
But it is happening.

19:31.445 --> 19:34.643
I'm about to be the father
to your grandbabies.

19:34.677 --> 19:36.374
Reach out a little.

19:36.406 --> 19:37.745
I meant emotionally.

19:37.777 --> 19:38.887
Oh.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.259
I can look myself in the mirror

19:40.291 --> 19:41.694
and know that I've tried my hardest

19:41.728 --> 19:43.621
to make our relationship work.

19:43.653 --> 19:45.449
Can you do the same?

19:46.821 --> 19:49.171
Go ahead.

19:49.203 --> 19:50.998
Here, let me give you some light.

19:51.032 --> 19:52.141
[Clicks]

19:52.173 --> 19:53.414
- Oops, uh, not that one.
- [Clicks]

19:53.446 --> 19:55.733
No.

19:55.765 --> 19:57.887
Claire: There are a lot of
ways for a family to grow...

19:57.919 --> 20:01.739
Both: Touchdown!

20:01.771 --> 20:04.513
Claire: ...finding interests
you didn't know you shared...

20:04.546 --> 20:06.145
- Eh...
- Come on, I've got two weeks!

20:06.177 --> 20:07.810
Blur your eyes. Look at this.

20:07.842 --> 20:12.021
Claire: ...finding new challenges
to embark on together...

20:12.053 --> 20:13.490
But it takes a lot of work.

20:13.523 --> 20:14.829
[Laughter]

20:14.861 --> 20:19.530
The best way for families to
grow is by adding to them.

20:20.013 --> 20:24.716
So this is to the newest
members of our family.

20:24.751 --> 20:28.846
I look forward to getting
to know all of you.

20:28.881 --> 20:30.454
- Love you.
- Cheers.

20:30.489 --> 20:30.589
[Overlapping cheers]

20:33.359 --> 20:36.996
I'm... f-f... f-freezing.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.062
- Manny: Cut!
- [Beep]

20:39.099 --> 20:41.100
Could it be any colder?

20:41.134 --> 20:42.769
- No!
- [Beep]

20:42.802 --> 20:43.970
[Shivers]

20:44.053 --> 20:45.889
Fur hat weather, no?

20:45.922 --> 20:46.956
- No!
- [Beep]

20:46.990 --> 20:48.425
"I'm so cold."

20:48.558 --> 20:49.959
"I'm so cold."

20:49.993 --> 20:52.462
"I'm so cold!" And action.

20:52.496 --> 20:54.731
[Shivers]

20:54.764 --> 20:56.918
Um... brr, am I right?

20:56.919 --> 20:58.697
You gotta be kidding me!
