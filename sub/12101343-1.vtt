WEBVTT

04:07.440 --> 04:08.429
Don't worry...

04:08.440 --> 04:09.998
...we'll find a new home eventually!

07:17.720 --> 07:18.789
Are you alright?

07:21.680 --> 07:24.353
You'll be in trouble if
you make a big fuss.

07:28.440 --> 07:29.395
Don't be scared.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.919
We're of the same kind.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.638
My name's FengXi, what's yours?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.433
Hei.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.668
Come on in.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.310
Down here.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.832
This is just somewhere abandoned by humans.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.919
That's XuHuai.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.159
He's gathering spirits.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.510
Yo!

10:27.960 --> 10:28.790
You're back!

10:29.440 --> 10:30.953
You're quite early today.

10:36.320 --> 10:36.957
A kitty—

10:41.040 --> 10:42.519
These are Lquhu and TianHu.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.191
Why did you bring back a kitten?

10:54.400 --> 10:57.472
My name's Hei. I'm a monster, too!

10:59.960 --> 11:01.678
Huh... you still have your ears.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.676
J—Just because they refuse to change!

11:04.680 --> 11:06.272
How adorable~

11:06.280 --> 11:08.589
TianHu, let's welcome Hei!

11:08.880 --> 11:10.233
Meat.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.114
Master WuXian,

12:22.120 --> 12:23.678
we've found traces of FengXi.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.759
Welcome Hei!

12:28.760 --> 12:30.159
Cheers!

12:36.200 --> 12:37.394
Yo, Hei~

12:38.800 --> 12:40.313
Don't be so shy.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.038
Here, take a look at this.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.955
You sure know how to cheer kids up.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.911
Wanna see a B/oom/ng Snowﬂower?

13:02.920 --> 13:03.830
I'm fine.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.955
Meat.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.798
You still lost to food.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.833
Hei,

13:21.840 --> 13:23.717
why don't you come live here as well?

13:28.680 --> 13:30.033
You don't want to?

13:30.080 --> 13:31.593
Of course I do!

13:32.440 --> 13:33.634
Then from now on,

13:33.640 --> 13:35.517
this will be your home.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.516
Okay!

13:42.640 --> 13:43.755
Wine.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.909
Not for him.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.350
Here.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.077
How's this?

13:57.440 --> 13:58.589
Go ahead,

13:58.600 --> 13:59.999
this will be your room.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.631
I'll be heading off now.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.277
Rest well.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.269
See you tomorrow!

14:24.120 --> 14:26.190
See? I told you we'd find a new home!

15:34.320 --> 15:35.036
Hei?

15:37.920 --> 15:38.909
WuXian,

15:38.920 --> 15:40.319
you're a human,

15:40.320 --> 15:41.469
why are you helping the Guild?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.997
My only duty here is to capture you.

15:44.040 --> 15:44.916
No need for explanations.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.276
Run!

16:13.480 --> 16:14.959
Hei! Come back!

16:36.120 --> 16:36.757
Go.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.112
But-

16:37.160 --> 16:37.637
Go!

16:39.840 --> 16:40.431
Go now!

17:33.800 --> 17:35.313
Where am I?

17:41.840 --> 17:42.989
How are you?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.359
I'm fine.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.157
We lost Hei...

17:46.160 --> 17:47.718
The Portal's gone, too.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.388
How can a single human
throw us into such a panic...

17:52.400 --> 17:53.992
This is WuXian we're talking about here.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.270
He's the strongest Executor.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.998
You're better off not
thinking of him as human.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.672
Are we just gonna give up Hei like this?

17:59.680 --> 18:00.829
Of course not.

18:00.840 --> 18:01.989
You can locate him, right?

18:02.040 --> 18:02.995
Yeah.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.235
I've already planted markers on Hei.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.188
WuXian will definitely
take him to the Guild.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.155
We still have a chance.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.353
We're no match for him...

18:11.360 --> 18:12.952
Leave it to me.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.394
Go find where they're headed.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.674
Don't tell me you're...

18:17.400 --> 18:18.879
Yeah.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.233
I can't endure this any longer.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.835
Got it.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.070
We'll be sure to find Hei.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.115
Good.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.553
I'll leave the rest to you.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.719
Where are we right now?

18:35.720 --> 18:39.076
This is the emergency exit we've prepared,
in case we're surrounded.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.793
My seeds' detection
radius is around 30 miles.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.155
I can sense when they leave the island.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.156
How will we know which
shoreline they're headed to?

18:47.200 --> 18:50.715
That's why we need to spread
these seeds on all the nearby shores.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.153
| see.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.315
TianHu,

18:53.360 --> 18:55.954
let your little ones help too.

18:55.960 --> 18:56.676
Hm.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.596
FengXH

19:32.200 --> 19:33.633
FengXi?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.079
FengXH

19:36.120 --> 19:37.314
Lquhu!

19:37.320 --> 19:38.753
TianHu!

19:40.520 --> 19:42.272
FengXH

19:42.280 --> 19:43.679
Lquhu!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.633
FengXH

20:11.320 --> 20:13.550
You don't know how to leave either?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.438
They've escaped.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.833
You're coming with me to the Guild.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.590
Don't try anything stupid, got it?

20:44.120 --> 20:45.439
FengXi?

20:49.120 --> 20:50.553
FengXH

20:53.560 --> 20:55.198
FengXH

20:56.920 --> 20:58.638
FengXi...

21:10.640 --> 21:13.029
Saved me the trouble of finding you.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.598
We'll be departing soon.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.233
Stop messing around.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.231
Wait quietly.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.629
Do you under-

21:32.640 --> 21:33.311
stand?

22:05.760 --> 22:07.193
Then from now on

22:07.200 --> 22:09.031
this will be your home.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.469
Master Min.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.710
Oh? Is that you, FengXi?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.073
It's been a while!

23:52.120 --> 23:53.951
Here for some tea?

23:54.440 --> 23:55.919
I'd like your help.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.879
As long as it's within the boundaries
of guild rules, I'll gladly help out.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.313
FengXi...

24:08.320 --> 24:12.029
Sometimes, it's better to let things go.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.039
I understand.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.712
Perhaps I could borrow something from you,
Master Min.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.396
Do you prefer being tied up?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.033
Coconut.

25:02.440 --> 25:07.116
Maaaaasteeeeeer!

25:07.160 --> 25:09.196
Good morning, master...

25:09.200 --> 25:10.076
MaoMao

25:10.120 --> 25:10.836
Yes?

25:10.840 --> 25:12.319
Help me up.

25:12.320 --> 25:12.991
Ok.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.869
You broke my boccaro teapot...

25:16.880 --> 25:18.598
Sorry, master.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.595
Quite the annoying weather.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.119
A dragon?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.359
How rare...

27:05.360 --> 27:06.839
This is...

27:08.840 --> 27:10.671
... Domain ?

28:08.360 --> 28:10.271
What's your name?

28:10.280 --> 28:11.599
Hei...

28:12.560 --> 28:14.312
Hei?

28:14.320 --> 28:15.594
Y-You' re not allowed to call me!

28:18.400 --> 28:20.834
Use that power from earlier again.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.433
What power?

29:11.360 --> 29:12.395
Come inside.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.912
T-There's no way I'll go in there.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.077
Where is this place?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.037
This is my Sp/r/‘z‘ Rea/m.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.434
Every living organism
has their own Spirit Realm.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.789
It's where our spirit resides.

29:39.840 --> 29:41.398
Its existence,

29:41.400 --> 29:43.868
is the foundation of
all life and abilities.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.632
Do l have a place like this, too?

29:45.640 --> 29:46.390
Of course.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.110
And a house like that, too?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.030
No.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.399
It's blank.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.476
This is my former home,

29:54.480 --> 29:56.118
I've stored it here.

29:56.120 --> 29:57.792
Is there any food in there?

29:57.840 --> 29:58.716
There isn't.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.118
Give me your hand.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.109
W-What do you want?!

30:18.200 --> 30:19.599
Caught the wrong guy...

30:20.360 --> 30:22.351
What kind of place is this?!

30:27.520 --> 30:27.997
Hey.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.268
Ah?!

30:29.280 --> 30:32.238
Want to learn how to manipulate metal?

30:32.520 --> 30:33.635
Aah?!

30:33.640 --> 30:35.756
I've checked your Spiritual Type,

30:35.760 --> 30:38.194
it's part metal, like mine.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.832
Why do you wanna teach me?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.513
Take it as a reparation...

30:44.520 --> 30:45.748
Huh?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.159
| see that you have some talent.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.629
Ah?!

30:51.680 --> 30:54.638
Start with fee/Mg the metal's presence.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.833
Salty?

30:58.840 --> 31:00.512
Might have been my sweat.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.354
I-l didn't say l was gonna learn!

31:03.800 --> 31:05.279
It's up to you.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.269
I won't force you.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.269
Maybe if /sn ’2' so bad after a//.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.794
Once //earn it,
/ might just escape with it!

31:32.320 --> 31:34.959
Don't resort to brute strength.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.037
What am I supposed to do then?

31:38.720 --> 31:40.039
Come here.

31:41.640 --> 31:42.550
Hmph!

33:22.800 --> 33:25.394
Loo/(s //ke he acz‘ua/ly
does have some z‘a/enz‘.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.472
Sorry about that,

33:52.240 --> 33:54.310
but we're already closed.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.309
You're HuaHu?

33:59.240 --> 34:00.992
And you are?

34:05.720 --> 34:09.679
What exactly in our store might
have piqued your interest, mister?

34:09.680 --> 34:11.591
All you had to do was ask.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.397
Withdraw your powers.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.469
Show yourself,

34:45.480 --> 34:47.072
or else l'll wreck your damn store!

34:57.160 --> 34:58.878
So this is your true form.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.557
W-What do you want?!

36:01.640 --> 36:02.993
Your name's WuXian?

36:04.440 --> 36:05.190
Yeah.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.599
Can't you fly?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.795
Why not just fly us back?

36:09.800 --> 36:10.755
I can't fly that far.

36:11.280 --> 36:11.792
Tsk.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.869
Useless.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.952
Why are you after FengXi and the others?

36:22.880 --> 36:23.517
Hey!

36:23.520 --> 36:24.555
Say something!

36:27.120 --> 36:28.109
Hmph.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.398
When we reach the shore,
will you let me go?

36:42.800 --> 36:43.869
Sure.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.029
Really?

36:48.120 --> 36:50.680
Are you serious?

36:50.680 --> 36:52.159
Say something!

36:52.160 --> 36:53.070
Hey!

36:53.120 --> 36:54.030
Hey!

36:54.080 --> 36:56.355
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

36:56.400 --> 36:57.469
So noisy.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.875
Found them.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.679
This is mainland,

37:06.680 --> 37:07.749
and this is the island.

37:07.800 --> 37:08.915
We're right here.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.598
They've strayed south by about 3000 miles.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.952
What a horrible sense of direction...

37:13.280 --> 37:15.350
The fish spirits are too slow,

37:15.360 --> 37:16.679
they won't be able to catch up.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.477
Which city is the closest
to their landing spot?

37:18.520 --> 37:19.919
Long You.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.512
Then let's head there.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.238
But that's within their territory...

37:23.240 --> 37:25.959
That's why we need to intercept
them before they reach the Guild Hall.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.234
Yeah.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.359
Long You...

37:53.480 --> 37:54.799
We're here.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.597
Land!

38:03.880 --> 38:05.393
Finally ashore!

38:06.240 --> 38:07.593
Hey!

38:08.160 --> 38:09.718
What are you two doing?

38:09.720 --> 38:10.755
Greetings.

38:10.760 --> 38:12.079
May | ask where this is?

38:12.120 --> 38:14.076
Uhh... XiaoXiang Reefs.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.792
I meant to ask, what province is this?

38:18.320 --> 38:20.038
You're illegal immigrants!

38:20.480 --> 38:21.469
No.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.316
I got lost.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.038
You got lost and missed an entire province?

38:24.440 --> 38:25.668
I can explain.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.556
I won't be fooled!

38:26.560 --> 38:28.073
Oi, call the cops!

38:30.800 --> 38:32.472
Yes, I am an illegal immigrant.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.755
Which province is this?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.233
F-Fulan province.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.954
Then I'll be going now!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.478
How about | treat you to a meal?

38:52.320 --> 38:53.116
This one,

38:53.120 --> 38:53.996
this one,

38:54.040 --> 38:54.472
this one,

38:54.480 --> 38:54.912
this one,

38:54.920 --> 38:55.397
this one,

38:55.440 --> 38:55.758
this one,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.034
oh, and this one!

38:58.680 --> 39:00.750
These are all great home style orders.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.557
Our specialty is sea food,

39:02.560 --> 39:03.595
so would you like to try-

39:03.600 --> 39:03.600
No.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.515
Very well.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.718
The only thing humans
are good at is making food!

39:28.840 --> 39:30.637
We accept mobile payment.

39:42.720 --> 39:44.915
This is my jade pendant.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.470
Keep the change.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.678
Walkouts!

40:01.440 --> 40:02.509
Dine and dash...

40:02.560 --> 40:04.949
We might not be so different after all.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.113
That was an accident.

40:10.680 --> 40:11.715
I'm leaving.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.108
Where do you plan on going?

40:15.120 --> 40:16.348
To find FengXi.

40:20.440 --> 40:21.316
Hei.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.068
Come to the Guild with me.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.478
Let me go!

40:34.480 --> 40:37.040
You promised me you'd let me go!

40:37.040 --> 40:38.678
My apologies.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.955
But I cannot just let you go.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.479
Don't you just want a place to live?

40:42.480 --> 40:44.311
There's no way I'm gonna live with humans!

40:46.400 --> 40:48.595
The place's full name is Spirit Gui/d.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.397
It was founded by monsters.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.951
Aren't you human?

40:52.960 --> 40:54.632
The current me...

40:54.640 --> 40:56.949
...might be closer to a monster.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.951
Plus, I don't live there.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.149
I'm just an Executor.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.872
What's an "Executor"?

41:02.360 --> 41:03.634
Kind of like an enforcer.

41:03.640 --> 41:04.834
Hah?

41:07.680 --> 41:09.398
Let's just say I run errands for them.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.677
Are there any other humans in the Guild?

41:12.080 --> 41:12.592
There are—

41:12.600 --> 41:13.191
I'm not going.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.560
You can choose to either
come with me by will,

41:16.560 --> 41:17.788
or by force.

41:18.680 --> 41:19.669
Bastard!

41:28.240 --> 41:29.832
Let me go!

41:29.840 --> 41:31.398
Every escape attempt
will add to your punishment.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.550
I won't run away anymore! Let me go!

41:35.400 --> 41:37.834
You'll also need to disguise your tail.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.829
Let go of me!

41:39.480 --> 41:41.630
That's two hours of punishment.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.198
Let me go!

42:32.560 --> 42:34.676
Why are you so hostile towards me?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.790
Because you're a bad person!

42:36.800 --> 42:38.119
And FengXi isn't?

42:38.120 --> 42:39.633
No he's not!

42:39.680 --> 42:40.954
You only knew him for half a day.

42:40.960 --> 42:42.234
He gave me food!

42:42.240 --> 42:43.798
And a tree house to stay!

42:43.840 --> 42:46.115
Don't I give you food as well?

42:47.760 --> 42:48.556
Hmph!

42:54.120 --> 42:55.838
Don't take your anger out on the food.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.988
What kind of bird is this?

43:06.800 --> 43:08.518
I don't think it's a
problem with the bird....

43:25.960 --> 43:27.518
Why don't you just fly?

43:27.520 --> 43:30.080
Flying randomly is
forbidden on mainland soil.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.189
Tsk.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.712
Sign

44:10.400 --> 44:12.197
Would you stop hiding?

44:43.040 --> 44:44.712
Do you want to take revenge on humans?

44:44.720 --> 44:46.039
For sure!

44:46.360 --> 44:47.793
How will you do it?

44:47.800 --> 44:48.789
Ki/i them all?

44:50.480 --> 44:51.833
ldunno...

44:53.120 --> 44:55.475
I just wanna return back to the forest...

44:57.960 --> 45:00.315
W-What?!

45:00.320 --> 45:01.036
Alright...

45:02.480 --> 45:04.152
I'm sure this time it'll be fine.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.914
How is it?

45:15.920 --> 45:16.955
We could make it.

45:16.960 --> 45:18.313
They aren't here yet.

45:18.320 --> 45:21.596
Then go from here and
start searching outwards.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.916
Be careful not to be detected by the Guild,
especially around their landing spot.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.353
Can FengXi make it?

45:27.280 --> 45:30.636
If he can't,
then it's up to us to hold them.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.960
Do you know what Domain is?

45:42.080 --> 45:43.798
I don't know.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.631
It's an ability that you possess.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.275
"Domain"...?

45:48.280 --> 45:49.998
Is it strong?

45:50.000 --> 45:53.470
Similar to my Del/our,
it's a Spatial Type power.

45:53.480 --> 45:56.438
It's a power that can make use of
one's Spirit Realm's special properties.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.795
Spirit Realm...

45:59.240 --> 46:00.150
Oh yeah,

46:00.200 --> 46:03.237
why can't we just go live in
that house inside your realm?

46:03.240 --> 46:04.798
/ could,

46:04.800 --> 46:06.313
but you can't.

46:06.320 --> 46:06.991
Tsk.

46:07.000 --> 46:07.989
Stingy...

46:08.840 --> 46:12.355
Never carelessly enter
someone else's Spirit Realm.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.355
Huh?

46:13.360 --> 46:15.555
Within the Spirit Realm,

46:15.600 --> 46:17.716
the realm's owner is akin to a god.

46:17.760 --> 46:20.479
Reckless entry will leave
yourself vulnerable to their will.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.829
How's that any different
from you out here...

46:23.400 --> 46:25.436
It's not the same.

46:25.440 --> 46:29.319
Don't you remember how I could
control and teleport you in the realm?

46:29.360 --> 46:31.430
You can't do that right now?

46:31.440 --> 46:33.271
Right.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.669
That's something I can
only do within my realm.

46:36.520 --> 46:38.909
I could even turn you
into an obedient puppet.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.354
Whatever.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.832
Don't want to go in anymore?

46:44.840 --> 46:45.397
Hmph.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.796
Alright, stop messing around.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.995
Can't you see there
are people resting here?

47:09.960 --> 47:11.029
WuXian!

47:11.080 --> 47:13.071
Long time no see!

47:13.080 --> 47:15.196
Oi, what's this?

47:15.240 --> 47:16.150
Don't be scared,

47:16.160 --> 47:17.195
they're old friends.

47:17.240 --> 47:18.514
You've gotten yourself an apprentice?

47:18.520 --> 47:20.272
Who's his apprentice?!

47:20.280 --> 47:21.918
I haven't.

47:21.960 --> 47:23.439
Hmm...

47:25.600 --> 47:28.114
Liar,
isn't he a Spatial & Metal Type as well?

47:29.240 --> 47:30.958
You guys are monsters?

47:30.960 --> 47:32.029
Mhm!

47:32.840 --> 47:35.718
They are all Executors of the Guild.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.312
Monsters run errands for the Guild, too?

47:37.320 --> 47:39.709
Huh?! What do you mean "run errands"?!

47:39.720 --> 47:41.756
Executors are sacred jobs!

47:45.720 --> 47:47.039
More or less.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.274
Huh?!

47:48.320 --> 47:49.070
You guys talk,

47:49.120 --> 47:50.394
I'll go sleep over there.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.398
Weren't you tasked with capturing FengXi?

48:00.400 --> 48:01.037
He escaped.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.832
Why don't you get back onto it quickly?

48:02.840 --> 48:05.070
What are you trying to do idling around?

48:05.760 --> 48:07.318
Just taking Hei around for a bit.

48:07.320 --> 48:10.153
Seems like you've put quite
some thought into the kid.

48:10.200 --> 48:12.316
Quite rare to find Power
Types this compatible.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.629
You've never taken a disciple before.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.476
You're over-thinking it.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.231
| just don't want him to
go down the wrong path.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.839
Are you guys on a mission?

48:22.880 --> 48:23.551
We are.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.993
RuoShui sensed a presence,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.195
and insisted we come see you.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.430
We were just about to
rest when she dragges us-

48:29.440 --> 48:31.510
Old geezer, you've got a problem?!

48:31.520 --> 48:32.953
O-Of course not, madame.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.072
By the way, WuXian,

48:40.120 --> 48:43.032
are you going to take Hei
with you to the Guild Hall?

48:43.040 --> 48:44.519
Mhm.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.589
Tsk.

48:46.600 --> 48:49.751
I'll be long gone before we get there.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.039
You two didn't reach a consensus?

48:56.360 --> 48:59.079
He never told you anything about the Guild,
did he, kiddo?

48:59.080 --> 49:00.559
He's always been like that.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.198
The Guild's a great place~

49:02.240 --> 49:05.516
Not only does it provide help
to small monsters like you,

49:05.520 --> 49:09.354
but it also helps old folks
like us adapt to modern life.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.709
Then why are you guys after FengXi?

49:11.760 --> 49:13.432
FengXi?

49:19.560 --> 49:21.915
Speaking of FengXi...

49:21.920 --> 49:23.751
I personally don't really dislike him,

49:23.800 --> 49:25.791
but his hatred for humans is too much.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.234
Often times he'll do
things that cross the line.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.913
We also wanted to talk to him about it,

49:30.920 --> 49:32.797
but he never cooperates.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.472
Humans are foul to begin with!

49:37.520 --> 49:39.272
Humans are just like monsters.

49:39.280 --> 49:41.111
It's hard to say whether
they are good or bad.

49:41.120 --> 49:44.715
What's good or bad depends
on ones perspective, too.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.315
Right now, the balance between humans and
monsters has reached a harmonious state,

49:48.320 --> 49:50.276
so we must do our best to protect it.

49:50.720 --> 49:53.234
Why do we have to live alongside humans?

49:53.280 --> 49:54.508
Do you all like humans?

49:54.560 --> 49:55.436
I do!

49:55.440 --> 49:56.509
Not quite.

49:56.520 --> 50:00.274
There are many monsters who choose
to live away from human civilization.

50:00.280 --> 50:03.511
Even if they live in cities,
it doesn't mean they like humans.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.272
Look at those two, they even hate WuXian.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.111
I would beat him up if I could!

50:07.120 --> 50:07.950
Yeah!

50:07.960 --> 50:09.678
You have the nerve to say that?

50:09.680 --> 50:12.399
Lil' Cat, come belittle humans with us.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.753
Nah, you guys are weak.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.794
Honestly,
I'm not a huge fan of humans either.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.279
I used to have a cave all to myself.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.918
It was a beautiful place!

50:25.920 --> 50:29.356
But around 10 years ago,
it was developed into a tourist spot.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.554
I even need a ticket to get in!

50:30.560 --> 50:33.597
That kind of dangerous spot,
was where I lived for hundreds of years!

50:33.600 --> 50:36.512
Nowadays trying to find a
place untouched by humans...

50:36.520 --> 50:37.839
Quite difficult.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.876
But I personally iove humans!

50:40.560 --> 50:44.633
They make all these new things every day!

50:44.680 --> 50:47.069
Like this long distance messenger.

50:47.120 --> 50:49.793
Not only can you communicate with it,
it can do so much more!

50:49.800 --> 50:53.679
Even some of the monsters
within the Guild are addicted to it.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.033
Humans are fascinating creatures!

50:55.080 --> 50:57.753
But WuXian is the most fascinating, right?

50:57.760 --> 50:59.432
Of course~

51:00.880 --> 51:01.596
Hei, Hei!

51:01.640 --> 51:04.074
WuXian has helped the monsters a lot.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.111
Please don't hold a grudge against him,
okay?

51:07.160 --> 51:08.832
You should come visit the Guild Hall!

51:08.840 --> 51:11.877
If you don't like it there,
we won't stop you from leaving.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.393
That is our place.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.475
Come come,

51:16.480 --> 51:16.992
let's drink!

51:17.000 --> 51:18.149
Ah, one sec!

51:18.920 --> 51:20.433
WuXian, cheers!

51:22.920 --> 51:25.480
Hey you two, come and have a drink.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.990
Fine, no point in missing out.

51:29.000 --> 51:29.637
Yeah.

51:30.560 --> 51:31.993
Cheers~!

51:41.080 --> 51:43.548
Right then, we'll be on our way.

51:43.960 --> 51:46.918
Hei, let's meet again at the Guild,
alright?

51:48.120 --> 51:50.031
Pardon,...

51:52.120 --> 51:53.792
...lend me some cash.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.988
Cash sure is great!

52:00.000 --> 52:01.479
Suddenly materialistic, huh?

52:03.400 --> 52:05.197
Can we ride that if we have money?

52:07.840 --> 52:09.671
We can even buy one.

52:18.680 --> 52:20.511
Hi gurl~

52:20.520 --> 52:21.475
Eh...

52:24.400 --> 52:26.789
Why couldn't we buy one of those?

52:26.800 --> 52:27.869
Dunno how to drive.

52:28.920 --> 52:29.750
Stupid.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.713
Listen up!

52:43.720 --> 52:45.119
We have you surrounded!

52:45.440 --> 52:47.351
Stop resisting!

52:48.600 --> 52:49.953
Don't come closer!

52:52.920 --> 52:55.639
Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot!

52:56.840 --> 52:58.432
Count this as surrendering.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.953
Finished?

53:02.960 --> 53:03.949
Mhm.

53:05.360 --> 53:09.751
You said I'm a Spatial Type,
but why can't I use it?

53:09.760 --> 53:10.590
Be patient.

53:12.760 --> 53:16.150
Can I learn how to use your Del/our, too?

53:16.160 --> 53:19.152
Every Spatial Type
can only have one ability.

53:19.200 --> 53:22.715
Then is my Domain
stronger than your Del/our?

53:22.720 --> 53:24.073
It depends on the user.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.678
Must be it then.

53:25.680 --> 53:26.954
You still have a long way to go.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.756
Hehe,

53:27.760 --> 53:28.636
you're jealous.

53:28.640 --> 53:29.356
Watch your mouth.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.873
You're a human, right?

53:32.880 --> 53:34.677
How come you are so powerful?

53:34.680 --> 53:35.635
Wanna become my apprentice?

53:35.640 --> 53:36.311
Pfft.

54:19.160 --> 54:20.593
Hei.

54:22.440 --> 54:24.954
If you don't like the Guild,

54:24.960 --> 54:26.951
I'll let you go.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.473
I don't believe you.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.349
You're very gifted.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.397
You're going to be very
powerful when you grow up.

54:35.400 --> 54:38.039
If you really choose to leave

54:38.040 --> 54:39.951
I hope you'll not abuse
that power to do bad things.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.473
Of course I won't!

54:42.640 --> 54:44.039
Can you even tell good from bad?

54:44.520 --> 54:45.748
Of course!

54:47.160 --> 54:49.116
Alright.

54:49.120 --> 54:49.791
I'll believe you.

54:53.800 --> 54:56.155
FengXi is not a bad person.

54:58.160 --> 54:59.559
Neither are you.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.352
But you're not so good either!

55:16.680 --> 55:18.716
How atrocious.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.999
Did you really not recognize him?

55:22.040 --> 55:23.871
Oh! Hold this.

55:23.880 --> 55:26.633
Now, try and remember what he looked like.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.398
Here, give it to me.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.230
Huh...

55:37.280 --> 55:38.633
Is this him?

55:38.640 --> 55:39.231
Yes.

55:39.240 --> 55:40.992
Wood Type monster.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.274
It's FengXi.

55:42.280 --> 55:43.315
FengXi?

55:43.960 --> 55:46.872
He'd never laid hands
on a fellow monster before.

55:46.920 --> 55:49.115
He stole my ability.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.513
What?

55:50.520 --> 55:52.351
Did FengXi have that kind of power?

55:52.360 --> 55:53.679
Haven't heard of it.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.955
Could it be an imposter?

55:55.960 --> 55:58.349
Maybe he purposely hid it from us.

55:58.840 --> 56:01.400
Stealing abilities is a huge taboo.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.351
Can't be sure without further evidence.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.998
We'll find out soon enough.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.270
RuoShui, come with me, we are faster.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.076
Ok.

56:08.120 --> 56:11.590
Master HuaHu, please follow
TianJie back to the Guild Hall.

56:11.600 --> 56:12.350
Okay.

56:13.280 --> 56:14.315
Let's go.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.476
How much longer til' we're there?

56:20.400 --> 56:22.595
You'll be able to see it
at the end of the tunnel.

56:36.080 --> 56:37.718
Come on down.

56:37.760 --> 56:38.556
We're here?

56:39.440 --> 56:40.714
I think we ran out of gas.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.439
Let's take the subway.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.552
Subway?

56:46.600 --> 56:48.670
It's like a very long car.

56:48.680 --> 56:49.237
Scared?

56:49.240 --> 56:50.389
I am not!

56:54.160 --> 56:55.229
Come here.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.156
I just hate walking on the city roads...

56:59.200 --> 57:00.349
I know.

57:02.320 --> 57:05.073
This is a city of humans, right?

57:05.080 --> 57:06.229
Yeah.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.030
Most guilds are located within cities.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.991
This one is called Long You.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.831
More than 10 million people live here....

57:13.840 --> 57:15.034
...and about 500 monsters.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.473
That many?

57:17.760 --> 57:20.069
Many monsters prefer to live in the city.

57:20.120 --> 57:24.193
They can choose their
own identity and lifestyle.

57:24.240 --> 57:26.708
However, they must all abide by one rule:

57:26.720 --> 57:28.597
They can't expose their true identity.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.750
Master WuXian!

57:31.480 --> 57:33.596
I sensed you from far away!

57:33.600 --> 57:34.476
Where are you headed?

57:34.520 --> 57:35.748
Bouquet delivery.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.874
So cute!

57:39.880 --> 57:41.518
Did you adopt it?

57:41.520 --> 57:44.114
I'm just on his head temporarily!

57:44.120 --> 57:46.873
Ahh, so it's a little fella.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.269
My apologies, please don't get mad.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.156
Here's a flower for you!

57:50.760 --> 57:53.274
Are you an Executor, too?

57:54.160 --> 57:56.833
Ehehe, I'm not that strong.

57:56.840 --> 57:58.717
I'm just a small Elf~

57:58.720 --> 58:01.109
l was also brought back by Master WuXian!

58:02.400 --> 58:04.675
Are you guys heading to the Guild?

58:04.680 --> 58:05.556
Yeah.

58:05.560 --> 58:06.390
I'm bringing Hei with me.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.119
Then we should be able
to see each other often!

58:09.120 --> 58:09.916
Ah!

58:09.920 --> 58:11.797
My delivery!

58:11.800 --> 58:13.677
I'll be seeing you around, Master WuXian!

58:13.720 --> 58:15.995
See you at the Guild, Hei!

58:16.640 --> 58:18.119
Oh, right!

58:18.120 --> 58:19.155
Welcome to Long You!

58:19.200 --> 58:21.873
You'll definitely like it here!

58:21.920 --> 58:23.239
Bye bye~

58:25.080 --> 58:28.959
Are there really that many
monster in human cities?

58:28.960 --> 58:29.676
There are.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.717
Come on, we're almost there.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.151
Oh right,
cats are forbidden on the subway, I think.

58:37.880 --> 58:38.915
Oh...

58:39.920 --> 58:41.399
What is this?

58:54.160 --> 58:56.310
Is this really below the ground?

58:57.520 --> 58:59.112
They're here.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.551
There really are cars here!

59:11.560 --> 59:13.232
Solong!

59:14.560 --> 59:15.470
This way.

59:16.400 --> 59:17.435
What about that side?

59:17.440 --> 59:19.271
Opposite direction.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.508
Wait in line here.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.433
Don't stray too far.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.398
Don't hurt them.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.391
They're being mind—controlled.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.550
What are they trying to do?

59:39.560 --> 59:40.470
What's this?

59:41.480 --> 59:42.196
Transport rune!

59:43.120 --> 59:44.314
Pleasure to meet you~

59:52.120 --> 59:53.951
He's already found us.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.793
Can't be helped,
Forced Te/eportaz‘ion has a small range.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.791
With this much disturbance,
the train might stop.

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.119
I'll go deal with the conductor.

1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:01.235
You deal with him.

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:09.278
Alright, got it.

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:17.279
Mister...

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.869
It'll get uncomfortable
for the little brother...

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.233
Excuse me sir, is that your child?

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:33.109
Oi, is that your kid?

1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:37.629
Sir, please answer.

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:40.313
Hey, say something!

1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:41.036
Kidnapping?

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:42.911
Who treats their own child like that?

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:43.875
Put the kid down!

1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:44.551
I can't see.

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:45.515
Let go of him-

1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:50.435
What did you do...?

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:55.108
Let's see how you're gonna keep up.

1:01:08.440 --> 1:01:09.759
Stop him!

1:01:12.360 --> 1:01:12.792
You—

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:21.709
Hei!

1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:26.871
Hmph!

1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:28.757
Daddy, daddy!

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:29.755
Daddy!

1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:30.829
Daddy!

1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:32.275
What's going on over there?

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.111
Look after these people.

1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:44.429
Quite resilient.

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:52.311
Good use of your power.

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.309
But you're lacking strength.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.472
I hate those who vandalize...

1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:05.875
...and then can't put up a fight.

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:08.639
What are these people?

1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:26.709
Monster...

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:35.832
What kind of kid is that?

1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:37.478
He won't eat us, right?

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.469
Don't talk nonsense.

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:42.239
Are you alright?

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.872
What could happen to me?

1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:44.676
Then let's move.

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.033
Little brother...

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.389
Thank you.

1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:57.589
No problem.

1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:01.435
Quite liked by people, huh?

1:03:01.440 --> 1:03:02.395
Hmph!

1:03:02.400 --> 1:03:04.675
Guild members should be here anytime now.

1:03:04.680 --> 1:03:06.636
Let's wait here for a bit.

1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.392
Why did they try to kidnap me?

1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:09.435
I don't know.

1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:10.754
Let's ask them when they wake up.

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:12.432
Why are we staying up here?

1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:14.072
Best not to be caught on camera,

1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:16.196
makes it easier for the
guild to handle afterwards.

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:17.958
If the conductor doesn't wake up,

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.712
we'll need to stop the train by force.

1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:23.797
You've made me protect humans...

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:24.915
You did a good job.

1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:28.275
Hmph.

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:37.190
Hei! I've come to pick you up!

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:38.189
FengXH

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.760
Hei, they're all involved in this.

1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:41.597
Huh?

1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:42.916
Take Hei and run!

1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:53.880
Stop Fighting!

1:03:55.040 --> 1:03:55.711
Certainly!

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:05.033
Master Min's B/are!

1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:08.589
Prick.

1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:11.114
Hei! I'll come back for you!

1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:26.036
Master WuXian-

1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:27.029
Save the people first.

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:29.112
Was that FengXi?

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:29.870
Yes.

1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:31.950
We've just received report,

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.036
FengXi is capable of stealing abilities.

1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.359
What?

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:37.157
Why haven't we heard about this before?

1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:39.230
He'd kept it a secret.

1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.354
His goal from the beginning...

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:47.952
...was Hei.

1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:50.997
The kid that was with
you that JiuLao mentioned?

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.228
Right.

1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:53.599
Hei possess Domain.

1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:55.716
Domain you say?

1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:58.350
If that's really Domain,

1:04:58.360 --> 1:05:00.271
if his ability gets stolen...

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:03.678
I did not treat him as a threat,

1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:05.591
that was my mistake.

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:07.312
Please find his whereabouts at all cost.

1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:10.198
I've already sealed the
city borders before I came.

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.275
He won't be escaping.

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:12.838
Very well.

1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:14.398
Contact me immediately
if you find anything.

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:15.753
You won't be in command?

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.079
They've got you.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.672
I'm all he has now.

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:26.316
President, we've taken care of everything,
there were no casualties.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:28.276
Wipe their memories,

1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:30.430
and let the humans handle the rest.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:33.677
Engage all Preceptors and locate FengXi,

1:05:33.680 --> 1:05:35.477
prepare a city-wide evacuation procedure,

1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:38.193
engage all Executors and request
reinforcement from headquarters.

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.800
Is it this severe? It
might lead to mass panic!

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:42.791
I'll make the mayor cooperate.

1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:45.234
We need to prepare for
the worst case scenario.

1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:47.390
Domain is something even
Master LaoJun couldn't deal with.

1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:48.515
We can't underestimate it.

1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:48.838
Yes, sir.

1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:57.476
When someone's ability gets stolen,
what happens to them?

1:05:57.480 --> 1:06:01.029
With normal abilities,
they'll only disappear temporarily

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.429
and they can train to reattain them.

1:06:03.440 --> 1:06:07.638
But for Spatial Type abilities,
it's linked to their Spirit Realm.

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:10.672
Those who lose their ability...

1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:12.352
...will die.

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:16.839
Chaos already ensues.

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:20.789
Are you hurt?

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:21.949
No, I'm not.

1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:24.591
Did you miss me?

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.593
Mhm!

1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.472
FengXH

1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:38.390
Are you alright?

1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:40.436
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:06:43.880 --> 1:06:46.348
Do you hate the monsters in the Guild?

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.311
What did they tell you?

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:53.836
They said the Guild is home to all
monsters and wanted me to live there.

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:02.273
Live there?

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:15.270
Certainly...

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:16.713
This place used to be my home.

1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:23.031
This city of rocks

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.196
was once rich with spiritual energy

1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:26.673
and gave birth to countless monsters.

1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:28.913
Because of us,

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:30.751
the forest grew ever so greener.

1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:33.797
It was like nature's heaven.

1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:37.512
Until one day,

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:38.839
the humans arrived.

1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:40.831
They sliced down trees,

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:41.909
burnt firewood,

1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:44.229
and lived within the forest.

1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:47.198
I did not hate them...

1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:49.629
...they brought a lot of fun, too.

1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:52.556
They were incredibly fragile,

1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:54.949
and in awe of our existence.

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:57.915
That was such a wonderful time.

1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:02.673
But later on,

1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:04.716
they rapidly evolved.

1:08:05.760 --> 1:08:08.194
Many monsters chose to abandon their homes.

1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:10.711
But I wished...

1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:13.075
they would've been the ones to leave.

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:21.429
And then the Guild came in.

1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:23.192
They were clearly monsters, too.

1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:27.757
We were no match for them.

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.398
So we left.

1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:33.436
Why must monsters live in secrecy?

1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.351
Maybe in the near future,

1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:37.430
humans will be above all of us.

1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.035
Yet the Guild still insists
on their laughable "balance".

1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:44.599
I need your help, Hei.

1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:49.670
You might not understand it yet...

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:52.518
...but your Domain could be
projected outside of your Spirit Realm.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.195
Anywhere it goes, it becomes your world.

1:08:56.200 --> 1:08:58.270
And within that world

1:08:58.320 --> 1:08:59.230
you are the god.

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:02.598
|-| don't know how to use it.

1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:04.672
I will help you.

1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:07.638
We can chase away all of humanity
and live freely as who we are.

1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:15.674
Is this why you've treated me so well?

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.870
Hei...

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:30.313
Don't forget...

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:32.629
...we were both chased
out of the forest by humans.

1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.189
I didn't forget.

1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:38.236
| just don't think this
is the right thing to do...

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:42.552
You still don't understand...

1:09:43.880 --> 1:09:46.348
They will only expand and
damage this world further.

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.518
Even the "good guys".

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.112
FengXi...

1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:53.951
If you hate them so much,

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:55.552
why can't we just not interact with them?

1:09:56.040 --> 1:09:57.632
We can leave together,

1:09:57.640 --> 1:09:59.835
and find a place like
that island from before...

1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:01.432
That's also great, right?

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:02.953
We shouldn't be fighting with them over it,

1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:05.349
we can just stay elsewhere, can't we?

1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:12.155
FengXi! Let me talk to him!

1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:14.874
FengXi! I can convince him!

1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:15.790
FengXH

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.677
I can choose not to stay here,

1:10:17.680 --> 1:10:19.511
but one day,

1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:21.033
we'll have nowhere else to go.

1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.437
I'm sorry, Hei...

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:28.000
I need your power!

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.035
FengXi...

1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:40.469
FengXi stop! FengXi!

1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:43.071
Don't!

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:44.439
FengXH

1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:45.429
FengXi...

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:57.631
So this is...

1:10:57.640 --> 1:10:58.993
Domain . ..

1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:08.117
Headquarters has confirmed FengXi's power.

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.031
It's called "Hijack".

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:12.759
It's the most potent
among similar abilities.

1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:16.355
It can steal other monsters'
energy and abilities by force.

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.198
The abilities he stole - B/are,
Spirit Paint, Detonate

1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:22.112
- were all specifically
chosen to counter you.

1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:25.197
However, stolen abilities aren't permanent.

1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:26.394
But...

1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:28.994
...if his true target is Domain...

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.230
Due to the Spatial Power's
special characteristics,

1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:33.037
once a domain has been established...

1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:34.957
...it'll exist permanently.

1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:36.479
Bastard.

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.674
We've found them, Master WuXian!

1:11:37.720 --> 1:11:39.472
FengXi's spiritual signal!

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:42.998
The ability I've used just now,

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.036
was definitely picked up by the Preceptors.

1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:46.871
We need to divert their attention.

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.318
When you see that my Domain is
fully established, we'll meet up again.

1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:51.036
Understood.

1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:53.759
Let's go!

1:11:57.840 --> 1:11:58.909
XuHuaH

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:26.276
Hei...

1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:27.156
Hei!

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:32.512
Hei, it's me.

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:34.678
It's WuXian, Hei!

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:50.918
How is he?

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.913
His Spirit Realm is slowly withering.

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.791
I'll take him to LaoJun.

1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:57.438
If LaoJun could save him,

1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.476
he wouldn't be pining
for the "Fire-Seek Cliff".

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:00.794
Then what can we do?

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:03.075
We must take the stolen
Domain back from FengXi.

1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:06.078
Give me all of FengXi's possible locations.

1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:11.396
I'll leave Hei in your care.

1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:12.833
No worries.

1:13:15.840 --> 1:13:17.831
Location 1, XuHuai confirmed.

1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:20.235
Requesting reinforcements.

1:13:21.040 --> 1:13:23.759
Location 7, Master HuaHu's Dawn Beast.

1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:25.591
They are purposely carrying
FengXi's spiritual signals.

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.993
Location 3 eliminated,
give me the next position.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:18.075
WuXian!

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:22.509
Give Hei's Domain back.

1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:24.670
It has already been stabilized.

1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:27.319
You can't return it anymore...

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:28.594
You're too late.

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.229
Why are you doing this?

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:33.958
If Hei dies,

1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:36.110
how can you say you're
doing this for the monsters?

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.279
l have nothing to say.

1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:16.671
FengXL

1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:19.274
it's not too late stop.

1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:21.555
For a human...

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:24.120
...to be this monstrously powerful.

1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:24.711
But...

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.750
I cannot lose to you here.

1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:32.034
I still have to answer
for my fellow brethren!

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:11.837
FengXH

1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:13.114
WuXian?

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:23.478
Everyone run!

1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:27.233
Cut off all public communications!

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:28.395
Start the operation.

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:28.912
Yes, sir!

1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:32.151
Attention, all Executors.

1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.918
The Domain '3 begun
spreading in the Central District.

1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:35.353
All members relocate to surrounding areas!

1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:36.918
Accelerate the evacuation!

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:47.152
Breaking Ne ws, a mysterious black
shadow has appeared above Long Y-

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:50.837
The cars have completely stopped.

1:16:50.840 --> 1:16:52.114
Move!

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:56.995
No way,
we won't be able to make it in time!

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:58.871
DaShuang, do it.

1:16:58.880 --> 1:16:59.471
Understood.

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:02.836
President, what about the aftermath?

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:05.149
Let's focus on how to deal with this first.

1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:14.237
The door's stuck!

1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:15.790
Come on out! Quickly!

1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:16.949
Tiger—

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:19.879
What the...

1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:30.030
I've sent you all the
remaining coordinates.

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:31.549
Roget

1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:44.390
WuXian?!

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:46.118
You actually came inside?!

1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:49.598
You should know...

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.068
...what it means to enter
someone else's realm!

1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:54.554
FengXi, don't be so stubborn!

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.276
Within my Domain...

1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:08.430
...you have no right to talk!

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.199
What's with all of you?

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.758
Can't even deal with a couple of weaklings?

1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:40.310
Master Nezha.

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:40.957
President.

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:43.554
WuXian went inside the Domain.

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:44.993
He went in?

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.035
That's not like him...

1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:47.473
So impulsive.

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:49.516
There's no way he'll be able to win inside.

1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:50.709
I'll go help him out.

1:20:50.720 --> 1:20:51.835
You guys clean up here.

1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:56.956
Did no one tell him that
the Domain is sealed?

1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:02.349
What's this?

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:07.352
Dare to play me?

1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:10.716
What's going on?!

1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:15.316
Spatial Types are so damn annoying!

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:22.753
Did Headquarters only send you?

1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:25.228
Is there anyone I couldn't deal with?

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:26.559
Uuh...

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:28.118
Then please do you best!

1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:30.031
Spacial Types are so damn annoying...

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:34.514
How is it?

1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:35.834
The evacuation is almost complete.

1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:38.111
How's Hei doing?

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:39.872
Still unconscious.

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.791
The Domain’s expansion is slowing down.

1:21:41.800 --> 1:21:43.836
WuXian must've found FengXi.

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:49.311
I wonder if he can last
until WuXian succeeds.

1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:57.430
Hei, why don't you come live here as well?

1:21:59.120 --> 1:22:02.192
Then from now on,
this will be your now home.

1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:04.109
Mm!

1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.594
FengXi! Let me talk to him!

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:12.477
I can choose to not stay here...

1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:14.431
But one day...

1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:16.158
...we'll have nowhere else to go.

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:17.309
FengXi...

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.515
I need your power!

1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.551
Did I die?

1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:36.593
FengXi...!

1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:37.396
WuXian?

1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:06.270
WuXian!

1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:07.349
Stop struggling!

1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:09.632
You can't win against me in my Domain.

1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:10.959
You've hurt your own kind,

1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:12.632
your friends have been captured,

1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:14.796
what's the point of
guarding this place alone?

1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:15.915
Such a huge city...

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:17.831
...is impossible to fully evacuate!

1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.678
There might still be humans trapped inside.

1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:22.432
Do you think the Guild...

1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:24.078
...will trade hostages with me?

1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:11.714
Don't move!

1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:22.314
WuXian,

1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:25.312
no matter if I'm right or wrong,

1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.515
there's no turning back now.

1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:29.837
lf Hei had never met you...

1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:34.115
...maybe he'd have cooperated
on opening the Domain...

1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.076
...and rebuilt a home for monsters with me!

1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:38.830
If that had happened...

1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:40.637
...I'm sure he would've been happy.

1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:43.637
It's a shame...

1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:45.957
...there are no "ifs"!

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:49.715
What?!

1:25:58.800 --> 1:26:00.028
Hei!

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:01.559
Who'd you say was gonna be happy?

1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:07.629
What? Impossible!

1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:34.196
You alright?

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:37.312
I don't really know,
felt like I was dreaming.

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.356
I heard you getting beaten up in my head!

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:53.917
We still need to defeat FengXi

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:54.989
and leave this place.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.035
Hei...

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:57.035
I need your help.

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.356
I have no idea how I did that just now...

1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:01.713
...a-and l—

1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:03.039
Hei...

1:27:03.040 --> 1:27:05.190
...this Domain belongs to you.

1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:07.793
Within this realm...

1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:10.951
everything is under your control.

1:27:12.160 --> 1:27:13.752
Plus,

1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:15.239
you still have me.

1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:15.877
Mhm!

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:18.828
I'm sorry, Hei.

1:27:22.600 --> 1:27:24.158
Go!

1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:33.194
Very good!

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:29.790
Both of you...

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:39.189
Hei!

1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:48.878
Hei, you need to calm down!

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:50.154
This is your Domain!

1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:52.555
It is mine!

1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:59.631
Go to hell!

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:00.755
Hei-

1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:24.235
Hei...?

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:26.555
Did you do this?

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.837
How's is this possible?

1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:44.159
This...

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:45.070
...is impossible!

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:22.553
l'm gonna kill-

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:25.315
Now, disperse the Domain.

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:27.759
Hei!

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:30.354
Within this realm, you are the god!

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:32.237
You can't just collapse this Domain!

1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:33.554
If you close it...

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.551
...you'll lose it forever!

1:30:35.560 --> 1:30:36.117
I don't care.

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:37.513
Hei!

1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:38.794
Don't do it!

1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:41.311
Hei!

1:30:41.320 --> 1:30:42.435
Hei...

1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:44.112
Don't do it...

1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:46.830
...don't do it.

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:48.956
Hei...

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.074
Is it over?

1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:13.309
WuXian...

1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:17.715
Search for remaining survivors.

1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:18.596
Yes, sir.

1:31:19.360 --> 1:31:22.318
We'll have plenty of
work to keep us busy now.

1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:26.677
The balance that was
so difficult to maintain...

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:28.711
...was destroyed so effortlessly.

1:31:40.520 --> 1:31:42.317
FengXi...

1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:53.198
Humans and monsters...

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:55.708
...can only seek coexistence.

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:57.671
It's impossible for one
side to destroy the other.

1:31:59.240 --> 1:32:00.798
Coexistence?

1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:04.112
By hiding for eternity?

1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:08.470
Do you still think you're in the right?

1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:12.478
Spend the time you
will serve in the Guild....

1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:15.074
...to think about it again.

1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:17.958
I've thought about it for long enough.

1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:19.868
This time...

1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:23.430
...l'm not leaving.

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.031
Hei...

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:37.116
I'm sorry.

1:32:55.400 --> 1:32:56.913
What a shame.

1:32:56.920 --> 1:32:59.115
They will just cut him down regardless.

1:32:59.120 --> 1:33:01.315
Maybe it'll become a park,

1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:02.958
entrance ticket required.

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:08.794
We have a long way to go...

1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:17.955
ls FengXi a bad person?

1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:19.075
Don't ask me...

1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:22.799
...you can answer that for yourself.

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:26.309
WuXian!

1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:29.676
Hei!

1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:44.109
Two Spirit Realms?

1:33:45.120 --> 1:33:46.678
So that's how it is...

1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.916
Quite rare for sure...

1:33:48.920 --> 1:33:52.310
Among those I know,
there's only Master XuanLi...

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:53.469
Hmm...

1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:56.631
There've only been a
handful throughout history.

1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:59.672
As for double special types,
I've never heard of anything like it.

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:01.750
How unfortunate...

1:34:04.720 --> 1:34:05.596
WuXian!

1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:07.352
Where's Lquhu?

1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.318
They've been captured.

1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:11.753
What will happen to them?

1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:14.356
Locked up for a long time, I'd suppose...

1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:25.951
What? You want an autograph?

1:34:25.960 --> 1:34:27.518
You're a boy?

1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:28.270
Yeah?

1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:30.877
Your hairstyle is cute.

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:32.916
If it weren't for the recognizability,
I'd have changed it long ago.

1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:34.148
Recognizability?

1:34:35.040 --> 1:34:35.756
Who are you?

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:37.149
See?

1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.513
Who are you?

1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:40.670
So you didn't know me to begin with?!

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:52.954
We're at the Guild Hall~

1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.630
It's Master WuXian!

1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:05.392
Hey, President!

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.716
Let's go! I'll show you what's inside!

1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:28.435
Hei.

1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:33.357
Let's part ways here.

1:36:42.760 --> 1:36:43.988
B-But why?

1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:45.632
Don't you live here?

1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:46.470
ldo...

1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:48.918
But I'm not that welcomed here.

1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.831
Mainly because he's too powerful.

1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:54.031
Many feel uncomfortable around him.

1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:56.438
I'm sure you'll like it here.

1:36:57.320 --> 1:36:58.912
I'll come see you often.

1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:55.510
Master!

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:08.635
Can...

1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:13.269
Can I go with you?

1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:24.429
Of course.

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.312
They are just visiting, huh?

1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:35.719
Should have said so earlier.

1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:38.118
What do you know...

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:40.392
Right! Should have said something.

1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:42.755
Master, lemme go with you, too!

1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:48.595
You sure you want to wander with me?

1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:51.430
Don't you want a home?

1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:57.039
I wanna be with you.

1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.034
Alright.
