WEBVTT

00:26.366 --> 00:30.335
I have searched, but heaven
is a combination

00:30.370 --> 00:33.833
of stars, angles and lines.

00:33.868 --> 00:38.277
Everything you have .

00:38.312 --> 00:43.216
Now, grant me passage
beyond this world.

00:43.251 --> 00:46.648
Allow me to see things
that cannot be seen.

01:05.834 --> 01:10.408
Now, forwards and
backwards through time,

01:10.443 --> 01:15.149
the pages of the book have
revealed its countless horrors

01:15.184 --> 01:17.382
and pleasures to those.

03:05.327 --> 03:06.920
Alice?

03:06.955 --> 03:07.591
Yeah.

03:07.626 --> 03:08.460
I'm up here.

03:08.495 --> 03:10.264
What are you doing?

03:10.299 --> 03:10.831
Reading.

03:10.866 --> 03:13.828
What are you reading?

03:13.863 --> 03:16.336
It's an HP Lovecraft story.

03:16.371 --> 03:18.965
This mad mathematician
named Vespuli just plucked

03:19.000 --> 03:20.736
his own frickin' eye out.

03:20.771 --> 03:22.837
Nasty.

03:22.872 --> 03:24.740
What's with the bags?

03:24.775 --> 03:27.611
Here, read this.

03:30.550 --> 03:30.845
Hmm.

03:38.657 --> 03:41.295
Wow.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.561
Drew's parents have
some nerve to send you

03:43.596 --> 03:47.433
some snail mail letter
after what he did to you.

03:47.468 --> 03:48.797
Mm-mm.

03:48.832 --> 03:49.897
I know, right?

03:49.932 --> 03:51.569
Yeah.

03:51.604 --> 03:52.768
Their precious little boy
beats the shit out of me,

03:52.803 --> 03:57.003
makes me lose my
baby, and now this?

03:57.038 --> 04:00.644
You fucking bitch.

04:00.679 --> 04:02.811
You really did it
this time, didn't you?

04:06.113 --> 04:13.459
You are nothing without me!

04:17.696 --> 04:19.795
I went and talked
to an old professor,

04:19.830 --> 04:22.501
and he told me that there's
a place right by the campus

04:22.536 --> 04:24.668
where I can get a room
and no one will find me.

04:24.703 --> 04:29.101
Wha-- you're
perfectly safe here.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.037
Look, Kel, I really
appreciate you

04:31.072 --> 04:32.874
letting me stay with you
for the past few months.

04:32.909 --> 04:34.073
Of course.

04:34.108 --> 04:38.385
But I have to get out of here.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.421
He's going to find me,
and he's going to kill me.

04:41.456 --> 04:44.017
I know he will.

04:44.052 --> 04:44.985
Oh, sweetheart.

04:45.020 --> 04:45.920
I'm sorry.

04:45.955 --> 04:49.055
Come here.

04:49.090 --> 04:50.727
Why is this happening
to me, Kelly?

06:59.891 --> 07:02.496
Hello?

07:02.531 --> 07:04.795
Hello?

07:04.830 --> 07:05.466
Anyone there?

08:00.314 --> 08:02.182
What are you doing in my house?

08:02.217 --> 08:03.590
Uh, sorry.

08:03.625 --> 08:07.055
Uh, I knocked, and
no one came, so--

08:07.090 --> 08:08.925
And that gives you the
right to just walk in?

08:08.960 --> 08:11.125
Uh, well, there must
be a misunderstanding.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.929
Professor Sherfick
sent me, and he

08:12.964 --> 08:15.866
said that you might
have a room for rent.

08:15.901 --> 08:18.033
Look, I have money.

08:18.068 --> 08:20.772
And, please, I--
I need to be here.

08:20.807 --> 08:22.576
I can feel it.

08:24.107 --> 08:26.140
I suppose you can
stay in the attic.

08:26.175 --> 08:26.943
Follow me.

08:26.978 --> 08:28.780
Oh, thank you.

08:28.815 --> 08:29.616
Don't say that yet.

08:29.651 --> 08:30.551
You have not seen it.

08:59.274 --> 09:01.747
There's a lot of junk in here.

09:01.782 --> 09:04.915
Maybe an old bed or a
mattress you can use.

09:04.950 --> 09:07.720
Most of the stuff can go out to
the dumpster, for all I care.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.249
But if you think you can
use something up here,

09:09.284 --> 09:11.922
you're more than welcome to it.

09:11.957 --> 09:13.055
I'll take it.

09:13.090 --> 09:13.422
Thank you.

09:13.457 --> 09:14.122
I really--

09:14.157 --> 09:14.991
No loud parties.

09:15.026 --> 09:16.157
No beer bottles.

09:16.192 --> 09:18.192
No squeaky mattresses.

09:18.227 --> 09:19.633
Don't leave food out.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.096
We have a corn field
across the street,

09:21.131 --> 09:23.769
so you will see a mouse
from time to time.

09:23.804 --> 09:25.037
Do you, um--

09:25.072 --> 09:27.938
I stay in the back of the house
should there be an emergency.

09:27.973 --> 09:30.270
My niece, Tommi, she's
around here somewhere.

09:30.305 --> 09:32.679
And my brother Joe
lives downstairs.

09:32.714 --> 09:34.208
People say he's crazy.

09:34.243 --> 09:36.375
He just loves Jesus
and his whiskey.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.213
You don't bother him,
he won't bother you.

09:39.248 --> 09:41.919
Um, do you have a key for me?

09:41.954 --> 09:43.217
I'll get you one made tomorrow.

09:43.252 --> 09:44.658
Don't leave food out.

10:24.997 --> 10:27.096
Oh, hey.

10:27.131 --> 10:28.394
Hi, I'm Alice.

10:28.429 --> 10:32.068
I'm just moving into the attic.

10:32.103 --> 10:32.838
Have you been saved?

10:36.305 --> 10:38.305
Oh, you must be Joe.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.047
Have you been saved?

10:44.082 --> 10:46.918
Uh, I need to get some
stuff out of the car.

10:50.825 --> 10:52.693
Only the blood of
Jesus can save you now.

11:00.769 --> 11:06.971
Come on and
reach for the sky with you

11:07.006 --> 11:15.375
and I. I want to be a fly.

11:15.410 --> 11:23.152
Open your
heart

11:40.534 --> 11:42.402
So sorry.

11:42.437 --> 11:45.273
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

11:45.308 --> 11:47.044
Really, I feel bad.

11:47.079 --> 11:48.243
I'm Tommi.

11:48.278 --> 11:48.610
It's fine.

11:48.645 --> 11:49.511
I'm Alice.

11:49.546 --> 11:52.115
So what did you do
to get put up here?

11:52.150 --> 11:55.481
Uh, your aunt said
this was all she had.

11:55.516 --> 11:58.352
Do you know how many
rooms are in this house?

11:58.387 --> 12:01.223
She definitely could have
gotten a better one for you.

12:01.258 --> 12:03.192
You know, I'm going
to have her fix this.

12:03.227 --> 12:04.358
No, wait.

12:04.393 --> 12:06.261
I want to be up here.

12:06.296 --> 12:08.197
No, you don't.

12:08.232 --> 12:11.266
This house is infested with
rats, and probably most of them

12:11.301 --> 12:14.401
are up here with
god knows what else.

12:14.436 --> 12:17.371
Oh, this is perfect.

12:17.406 --> 12:19.978
I mean, look at the
suggested geometric shapes.

12:20.013 --> 12:22.541
It's perfect for my studies.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.313
Well, if it's any consolation
for scaring the living shit out

12:25.348 --> 12:28.349
of you, uh, I could help
you set up your room.

12:28.384 --> 12:29.889
Yeah, I'll just
take you up on that.

12:40.066 --> 12:41.560
You're playing good!

12:41.595 --> 12:43.166
Yeah!

12:43.201 --> 12:44.563
Look at that-- oh, look
at that color right there.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.433
Yeah!

12:46.468 --> 12:47.841
And it has like--

12:47.876 --> 12:48.974
you could pick your, like--

12:49.009 --> 12:50.877
Time for ice--
it's time for cake.

12:50.912 --> 12:51.811
Yeah!

12:51.847 --> 12:53.077
Don't you want to
open up your presents?

12:53.112 --> 12:53.572
Yeah.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.980
All right.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.344
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

12:56.379 --> 12:58.049
I'm actually tempted
to eat it right now.

12:58.084 --> 12:58.544
Oh, hey, bro.

12:58.579 --> 12:59.479
Hey, guys.

12:59.514 --> 13:00.315
What's up?

13:00.350 --> 13:00.887
Hi, everybody.

13:00.922 --> 13:01.184
Hi.

13:01.219 --> 13:03.417
Hi!

13:03.452 --> 13:05.023
Can I pee first?

13:05.058 --> 13:05.584
Well, hurry up.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.585
Are you kidding me?

13:06.620 --> 13:07.421
I guess we'll wait on you.

13:07.456 --> 13:08.191
Aw.

13:08.226 --> 13:08.992
He leaves us.

13:09.027 --> 13:10.424
It must mean we
can eat the cake.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.057
Let the
heat go to the top.

13:39.092 --> 13:42.489
Let the ball go down low.

13:42.524 --> 13:49.661
Let your feelings overtake
you, feelings all around.

13:49.696 --> 13:50.662
All around.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.630
Bend with the knees.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.466
Don't use your back.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.138
All around.

13:54.173 --> 13:55.436
Feelings all around.

13:55.471 --> 13:56.107
Ew.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.375
this one?

14:00.410 --> 14:02.113
OK.

14:02.148 --> 14:06.282
Let your feelings
overtake you, overtake you,

14:06.317 --> 14:08.482
overtake you.

14:08.517 --> 14:10.451
I know it's scary.

14:10.486 --> 14:12.420
Overtake you.

14:12.455 --> 14:13.685
Got to be tough.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.687
Overtake you.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.328
Feeling change, feeling change.

14:21.530 --> 14:23.002
What the hell's in this?

14:27.242 --> 14:32.473
Be tough, but give
up and let them overtake you.

14:32.508 --> 14:36.477
Let your feelings overtake you.

14:36.512 --> 14:38.413
All right, well, I'm
going to go downstairs.

14:38.448 --> 14:40.250
Do you want to check
out the kitchen?

14:40.285 --> 14:43.990
Oh, you know, I really
need to get some sleep.

14:44.025 --> 14:45.684
Maybe tomorrow.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.357
I have a really important
meeting in the morning.

14:48.392 --> 14:48.687
All right.

14:51.428 --> 14:52.361
Good night.

14:52.396 --> 14:52.966
Good night.

16:45.806 --> 16:46.310
Wow.

17:41.763 --> 17:46.304
Hey, what's the matter?

17:46.339 --> 17:49.241
Hi.

17:56.448 --> 17:57.249
Hey, where are you?

18:08.229 --> 18:09.195
Where are you guys?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.166
OK, I'll see you in a minute.

18:38.226 --> 18:38.488
Alice?

18:38.523 --> 18:39.456
Yes.

18:39.491 --> 18:40.688
It's a pleasure.

18:40.723 --> 18:41.227
Come on in.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.201
Well, first off, let
me start by saying

18:48.236 --> 18:51.567
what a dream of a lifetime
it is to have you mentor me.

18:51.602 --> 18:53.635
I'm astonished with what
you've been able to accomplish.

18:53.670 --> 18:56.572
Oh, thank you.

18:56.607 --> 18:58.805
Although, your work does
border on science-fiction,

18:58.840 --> 19:01.709
I am intrigued by some
of the connections

19:01.744 --> 19:04.382
you were able to draw between
three-dimensional geometry

19:04.417 --> 19:06.318
and the way we
perceive these angles.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.915
See, I'm trying to prove
that structures are built

19:09.950 --> 19:12.951
for several different reasons.

19:12.986 --> 19:18.561
One, as a place for
worship or living.

19:18.596 --> 19:23.302
And, two, as a gateway to
somewhere else, another plane,

19:23.337 --> 19:26.569
another dimension.

19:26.604 --> 19:30.309
Like the Egyptians, the
druids, and Stonehenge.

19:30.344 --> 19:32.608
Like the Nazis at Wewelsburg
in their magic castle?

19:32.643 --> 19:34.742
Yes, exactly.

19:34.777 --> 19:36.909
These places exist.

19:36.944 --> 19:40.748
And with the use of sacred
geometry and architecture,

19:40.783 --> 19:44.356
I believe these people gain
certain powers or abilities

19:44.391 --> 19:46.886
that we don't quite
fully understand.

19:46.921 --> 19:48.261
I do have a few concerns.

19:48.296 --> 19:49.790
And if you want my
help, you're going

19:49.825 --> 19:51.726
to have to work around
my very busy schedule.

19:51.761 --> 19:53.893
And one more thing.

19:53.928 --> 19:54.927
Uh huh.

19:54.962 --> 19:56.434
Go over these notes.

19:56.469 --> 19:57.402
OK.

19:57.437 --> 19:58.931
They will help you get
caught up as well as

19:58.966 --> 20:01.538
help you with your research.

20:01.573 --> 20:01.972
Thank you.

20:02.007 --> 20:02.803
I appreciate it.

20:02.838 --> 20:03.771
You're very welcome.

20:03.806 --> 20:05.377
Just make sure you're
at my next lecture.

20:14.949 --> 20:18.753
I don't like anyone being here.

20:18.788 --> 20:21.591
Anyway, Tomasina, I'm going
to the back of the house.

20:21.626 --> 20:24.792
Make sure you turn everything
off when you're done.

20:24.827 --> 20:26.497
Hey.

20:26.532 --> 20:27.663
How was your meeting?

20:27.698 --> 20:28.697
It went well.

20:28.732 --> 20:29.467
Thanks.

20:29.502 --> 20:30.600
That's good.

20:30.635 --> 20:33.031
So can I call you Tomasina too?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.538
No.

20:34.573 --> 20:35.968
Oh, come on.

20:36.003 --> 20:38.971
Oh, so why do you let her
talk to you like that, anyhow?

20:39.006 --> 20:41.347
Like, don't you
get sick of that?

20:41.382 --> 20:43.613
I just don't let her bother me.

20:43.648 --> 20:47.012
She's kind of my
only sane relative.

20:47.047 --> 20:48.618
All right.

20:48.653 --> 20:50.851
Well, have you lived here
your whole life or what?

20:50.886 --> 20:51.885
Pretty much.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.623
Yeah?

20:53.658 --> 20:58.331
So does she-- does your aunt
know the history of the house?

20:58.366 --> 21:02.599
Can we maybe talk to
her about it sometime?

21:02.634 --> 21:04.898
I mean, she knows
everything about this house.

21:04.933 --> 21:08.770
But as you can see, she's not
really much of a people person.

21:08.805 --> 21:10.475
Yeah.

21:10.510 --> 21:13.379
But, I mean, I know some
things about the house.

21:13.414 --> 21:15.810
I can take you on a tour.

21:15.845 --> 21:16.580
That'd be great.

21:16.615 --> 21:16.947
Sure.

21:16.982 --> 21:18.780
All right.

21:18.815 --> 21:19.616
Right now?

21:19.651 --> 21:20.150
Yep.

21:20.185 --> 21:22.113
All right, I'm down.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.588
Which way?

21:24.623 --> 21:24.918
Follow you.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.056
And this is Keziah.

21:31.091 --> 21:33.894
She was a servant
girl a long time ago.

21:33.929 --> 21:36.666
Why would they paint a servant?

21:36.701 --> 21:38.800
I don't know.

21:38.835 --> 21:42.507
But my aunt likes to come in
here and talk to it for hours.

21:42.542 --> 21:45.906
I thought you said
she was the sane one.

21:45.941 --> 21:48.447
She's talking to the painting?

21:48.482 --> 21:51.384
Well, I don't know
what she hears.

21:51.419 --> 21:52.517
But come check this out.

22:02.188 --> 22:07.631
OK, so here's where Etta keeps
all the historic paperwork.

22:07.666 --> 22:10.161
Why she hides it back
here, I don't know.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.031
Oh.

22:12.066 --> 22:15.672
Wow, that is so amazing.

22:15.707 --> 22:17.069
Do you mind if I look around?

22:17.104 --> 22:18.070
Not at all.

22:18.105 --> 22:19.038
Yay.

22:19.073 --> 22:20.039
Just please be quiet.

22:20.074 --> 22:22.745
If she knew that we were
up here, she'd kill us.

22:22.780 --> 22:23.379
Oh, of course.

22:23.414 --> 22:26.012
I'll be quiet, I promise.

22:26.047 --> 22:27.717
Hey, I'm going to get some wine.

22:27.752 --> 22:29.554
Would you like some?

22:29.589 --> 22:30.687
You know what, yeah.

22:30.722 --> 22:31.787
Sure, that sounds good.

22:31.822 --> 22:32.854
All right, I'll be right back.

22:32.889 --> 22:34.592
All right, thanks.

22:34.627 --> 22:35.857
Have fun.

22:35.892 --> 22:36.561
Oh, I will.

23:42.123 --> 23:43.760
Here you go.

23:43.795 --> 23:44.123
Thank you.

23:48.063 --> 23:51.636
I found some really
interesting stuff.

23:51.671 --> 23:54.001
Mm.

23:54.036 --> 23:55.607
Check out these blueprints.

23:58.843 --> 24:03.912
And, and, yeah, there's these
old newspaper articles in there

24:03.947 --> 24:05.914
that have--

24:05.949 --> 24:08.114
I think it was a murder
that actually happened here.

24:08.149 --> 24:09.522
Was I reading that right?

24:09.557 --> 24:11.722
And why wouldn't you
tell me about this?

24:11.757 --> 24:17.057
I already told you that my Aunt
Etta is into all that stuff.

24:17.092 --> 24:20.533
I think that you should
check out this room with me

24:20.568 --> 24:21.567
across the hall.

24:24.165 --> 24:25.263
Oh, yeah?

24:25.298 --> 24:25.802
Yeah.

33:15.498 --> 33:17.201
Sleep, sleep.

33:19.733 --> 33:21.436
Soon, you will awake.

35:52.424 --> 35:54.292
Don't turn away.

35:54.327 --> 35:56.657
I'm doing all, all this for you.

36:48.579 --> 36:55.518
Now, Keziah, with the
blood of innocence,

36:55.553 --> 36:57.256
bring forth the beast.

38:38.689 --> 38:39.490
Oh, god.

38:46.994 --> 38:47.498
Shit!

39:08.653 --> 39:12.622
That means space and
time are not inseparable.

39:12.657 --> 39:16.021
And if plotted on a graph,
the resultant curvature

39:16.056 --> 39:19.497
or frameshift that's
a part of each of us

39:19.532 --> 39:23.732
creates a weak spot in the
space-time that surrounds us.

39:23.767 --> 39:28.033
This is called the
Versiera, or witch's curve.

39:28.068 --> 39:32.510
And certain geometric shapes
can magnify the potential energy

39:32.545 --> 39:34.512
of human thought,
completely freeing us

39:34.547 --> 39:37.944
from the constraints
of space-time

39:37.979 --> 39:42.685
and making it possible to be
at any place or at any time.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.886
This is why extra dimensional
beings are so dangerous.

39:45.921 --> 39:48.757
There's almost nothing
you can do against one.

39:48.792 --> 39:50.957
If you're very, very
lucky, it won't notice you

39:50.992 --> 39:53.531
and accidentally kill you.

39:53.566 --> 39:56.567
And if you encountered
a structure built

39:56.602 --> 39:57.832
by an extradimensional mind--

40:03.708 --> 40:04.806
Alice, Alice.

40:08.845 --> 40:09.613
Is she OK?

40:13.817 --> 40:14.816
Yo!

40:26.027 --> 40:27.598
What happened?

40:27.633 --> 40:28.225
What happened?

40:34.002 --> 40:35.166
She all right?

40:35.201 --> 40:36.673
Yeah, it's OK.

40:36.708 --> 40:37.509
I've got it.

40:37.544 --> 40:38.708
Thank you.

40:38.743 --> 40:39.542
Thank you.

40:39.577 --> 40:42.580
I don't know what's
happening to me.

40:42.615 --> 40:48.553
I feel like there's some
spiritual force using me.

40:48.588 --> 40:51.721
I slip in and out of dreams.

40:51.756 --> 40:54.691
I woke up at home and
thought I was here.

40:54.726 --> 40:56.957
Even this could be a dream.

40:56.992 --> 41:00.598
I don't even know
what day it is.

41:00.633 --> 41:01.896
I--

41:01.931 --> 41:05.031
I know somebody, and I
think that he can help us.

41:05.066 --> 41:06.164
OK?

41:06.199 --> 41:06.802
We'll go.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.041
What seems to be
the problem, Kelly?

41:15.076 --> 41:17.142
You seem quite upset
when you called.

41:17.177 --> 41:19.815
Are you familiar with
the Hannah house?

41:19.850 --> 41:23.621
There's a lot of stories
surrounding that place.

41:23.656 --> 41:24.622
Why do you ask?

41:24.657 --> 41:27.218
Have you ever heard of
Keziah Mason by chance?

41:53.015 --> 41:54.916
It says here she was
an immigrant servant

41:54.951 --> 41:56.687
girl for the Hannah family.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.053
You know, girls went missing.

42:00.088 --> 42:03.122
Local people accused
her of using black magic

42:03.157 --> 42:08.325
to lure them into the house
and killed him in the attic.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.801
So she was burned at the stake.

42:11.836 --> 42:14.936
Soon after her death,
people found bones

42:14.971 --> 42:19.336
under the floorboards of the
attic in the Hannah house.

42:19.371 --> 42:21.778
We still have an unusual
number of children

42:21.813 --> 42:24.814
going missing to this day.

42:24.849 --> 42:27.817
She's more than a witch.

42:27.852 --> 42:30.754
She's a Versiera, a
wife of the devil.

42:34.122 --> 42:36.661
My advice to you girls is to
stay away from that house.

42:39.897 --> 42:42.359
You know, Alice,
I think you really

42:42.394 --> 42:45.736
need to get out of that house.

42:45.771 --> 42:47.265
You know that's not going
to happen right now.

42:47.300 --> 42:50.906
I can't leave.

42:50.941 --> 42:55.207
Did you not hear anything
that my friend was saying?

42:55.242 --> 42:59.816
Mhm, but I am this close
to proving my theory.

42:59.851 --> 43:03.787
Oh, please, listen to yourself.

43:03.822 --> 43:08.385
I mean, I'm sorry, but
just yesterday in class,

43:08.420 --> 43:11.421
you had the most epic meltdown.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.390
And all of a sudden
today, you're

43:13.425 --> 43:15.425
this witch house detective--

43:15.460 --> 43:16.426
Shh.

43:16.461 --> 43:17.060
--and it kind of worries me.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.033
Shh, I want to hear this.

43:19.068 --> 43:20.969
--who went missing two days
ago from Hidden Pines City Park

43:21.004 --> 43:23.400
near Miskatonic University.

43:23.435 --> 43:25.776
She was wearing
an orange jumpsuit

43:25.811 --> 43:27.877
with matching headband.

43:27.912 --> 43:30.440
Several search teams have
been combing Carson County

43:30.475 --> 43:32.717
and surrounding woods.

43:32.752 --> 43:34.213
Police aren't saying
if this is connected

43:34.248 --> 43:36.754
to any other recent
missing children.

43:36.789 --> 43:40.186
Nine-year-old Josh Gibson is
still missing ----

43:40.221 --> 43:42.221
Wait, did you hear that?

43:42.256 --> 43:43.321
That's the missing kids.

43:43.356 --> 43:45.125
That's what he was--

43:45.160 --> 43:46.390
that's what he
was talking about.

43:48.999 --> 43:51.131
I didn't want to tell you
this because I didn't want

43:51.166 --> 43:53.166
to worry you, and
it's really messed up,

43:53.201 --> 43:56.741
but I had this realistic, like
really real dream that there

43:56.776 --> 43:58.369
was a baby being sacrificed.

43:58.404 --> 44:00.140
What?

44:00.175 --> 44:01.845
Oh, my god.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.782
That's it, I'm going
to call the cops.

44:04.817 --> 44:05.244
Wait, no.

44:05.279 --> 44:06.850
Why?

44:06.885 --> 44:09.215
Like, what-- seriously,
what are they going to do?

44:09.250 --> 44:11.217
Are you going to tell them
that my friend had a bad dream?

44:11.252 --> 44:12.724
Come on.

44:12.759 --> 44:15.122
It seems better than
nothing at this point

44:15.157 --> 44:16.959
with everything going on.

44:16.994 --> 44:22.459
I think, Alice, you need to
get out of that damn attic.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.197
That's not going
to happen tonight,

44:24.232 --> 44:25.968
so I'm going to go
and get some sleep.

44:26.003 --> 44:27.398
I'm really tired.

44:27.433 --> 44:28.432
We'll talk about this later.

44:28.467 --> 44:30.973
Well, can you at
least promise me

44:31.008 --> 44:34.372
that you'll think about
it, about getting out?

44:34.407 --> 44:35.912
I promise, Kel.

44:35.947 --> 44:36.715
Good night.

45:01.335 --> 45:04.171
Commonly referred to as the
Marktkirche, or the church

45:04.206 --> 45:08.373
on the market, the striking
14th century brick structure

45:08.408 --> 45:10.408
currently houses the
main Lutheran Church

45:10.443 --> 45:13.510
in Hanover, Germany.

45:13.545 --> 45:15.281
Thanks to its large
scale flourishing

45:15.316 --> 45:18.449
of ancient symbolism, it
is the subject of comments

45:18.484 --> 45:21.122
and many conspiracy theories.

45:21.157 --> 45:23.861
Most commonly referred to is the
giant pentagram on the church's

45:23.896 --> 45:25.291
western tower.

45:25.326 --> 45:27.799
And as if that weren't
enough, a giant hexagram

45:27.834 --> 45:30.098
surrounds that tower's clock.

45:30.133 --> 45:31.935
Of course, the truth
of the matter is that

45:31.970 --> 45:34.102
five-and-six-pointed
stars have a long,

45:34.137 --> 45:36.170
fluid history in Germany.

45:36.205 --> 45:38.139
First used by the
Teutonic pagans,

45:38.174 --> 45:43.848
and then adopted by the church
at the time of construction.

45:43.883 --> 45:46.884
The pentagram in particular
was a symbol of the Epiphany.

45:46.919 --> 45:49.183
This church in particular
with its grand organ

45:49.218 --> 45:53.154
is a striking example of
Germany's rich Gothic brick

45:53.189 --> 45:53.858
tradition.

46:13.539 --> 46:15.176
Oh, my god.

46:15.211 --> 46:16.012
What the--

46:58.958 --> 47:02.322
Oh, my god!

51:42.208 --> 51:43.537
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

51:43.572 --> 51:45.308
Alice, wake up!

51:45.343 --> 51:45.608
Alice!

51:46.542 --> 51:47.607
Come on!

51:47.642 --> 51:48.344
Hey, it's Tommi.

51:48.379 --> 51:48.674
No!

51:52.284 --> 51:54.284
You're safe.

51:54.319 --> 51:56.484
You had a fever.

51:56.519 --> 51:58.519
I just need you to relax
so I can take care of you.

52:00.820 --> 52:02.787
My head, oh.

52:07.596 --> 52:12.269
I think I might have actually
proven my dissertation.

52:12.304 --> 52:13.468
What?

52:13.503 --> 52:15.404
Yeah.

52:15.439 --> 52:17.439
My research is correct.

52:17.474 --> 52:21.476
The geometry, it all adds up.

52:21.511 --> 52:24.710
It's like I opened a portal
or warped reality, something.

52:24.745 --> 52:27.218
I don't know.

52:27.253 --> 52:28.615
You know I love
this stuff, but I

52:28.650 --> 52:30.551
think you might still
be a bit delirious.

53:52.063 --> 53:52.567
No!

55:46.485 --> 55:49.387
Alice, Dr. Harmon
is ready for you.

55:58.057 --> 56:00.629
Alice, thanks for coming in.

56:00.664 --> 56:05.535
I wanted to discuss with you
the results of your blood work.

56:05.570 --> 56:07.636
According to the
test, you're pregnant.

56:11.543 --> 56:11.838
What?

56:15.580 --> 56:17.844
I understand your history,
but you're pregnant.

56:23.753 --> 56:24.884
No, that can't be.

56:24.919 --> 56:27.018
I can't get pregnant.

56:27.053 --> 56:29.889
I can't.

56:29.924 --> 56:33.827
Look, we have somebody on our
staff who you could speak with,

56:33.862 --> 56:34.531
if you like.

56:38.603 --> 56:41.065
No, that won't be necessary.

56:41.100 --> 56:47.511
Alice, take some time and
take care of yourself.

56:47.546 --> 56:50.173
I have to go.

56:50.208 --> 56:50.712
To go.

57:16.905 --> 57:20.676
And you shall loathe yourselves
at your own sight because

57:20.711 --> 57:25.274
of all the evils that
you have committed.

57:25.309 --> 57:28.013
There, you shall
remember your ways

57:28.048 --> 57:31.852
and all your doings with
which you were defiled.

57:31.887 --> 57:36.923
And you shall loathe yourselves
at your own sight because

57:36.958 --> 57:40.762
of all the evils that
you have committed.

57:40.797 --> 57:43.259
There, you shall
remember your ways

57:43.294 --> 57:47.098
and all your doings with
which you were defiled.

57:47.133 --> 57:52.202
And you shall loathe yourselves
at your own sight because

57:52.237 --> 57:56.074
of all the evils that
you have committed.

57:56.109 --> 58:00.243
And all your doings with
which you have defiled,

58:00.278 --> 58:04.115
you shall loathe yourselves
at your own sight because

58:04.150 --> 58:06.887
of all the evils that
you have committed.

58:13.896 --> 58:16.864
And there, you shall
remember your ways

58:16.899 --> 58:20.835
and all your doings with
which you were defiled.

58:20.870 --> 58:24.839
And you shall loathe yourselves
at your own sight because

58:24.874 --> 58:27.776
of all the evils that
you have committed.

58:33.784 --> 58:36.246
And there, you shall
remember the ways

58:36.281 --> 58:40.217
and all your doings with
which you were defiled.

58:40.252 --> 58:42.560
And you shall
loathes yourselves--

58:46.027 --> 58:47.257
Did you miss me?

58:50.900 --> 58:53.802
No, no, help!

59:02.945 --> 59:04.813
Help!

59:04.848 --> 59:07.013
You stop!

59:07.048 --> 59:07.618
I'm pregnant!

59:14.253 --> 59:16.220
You and I both know.

59:16.255 --> 59:20.631
Don't fucking lie to me.

59:20.666 --> 59:24.965
You and I both know
you can't get pregnant.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.639
I know, because I
made sure of it!

59:41.885 --> 59:43.621
Sick bitch.

1:00:06.877 --> 1:00:11.077
Joe, I think you killed him.

1:00:11.112 --> 1:00:13.651
He isn't the only one
I've killed for you.

1:00:18.416 --> 1:00:22.451
But Kevin's been quiet
for a long time now.

1:00:22.486 --> 1:00:24.860
And because of you, she's back.

1:00:30.769 --> 1:00:32.164
You're the one that's
taking the children.

1:00:35.334 --> 1:00:36.872
She controls me.

1:00:43.507 --> 1:00:44.913
She makes me do it.

1:00:50.019 --> 1:00:51.117
Hurry, Alice!

1:00:51.152 --> 1:00:53.251
The evil grows inside of you.

1:01:23.349 --> 1:01:25.085
Tommi?

1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:27.483
How?

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:30.189
Alice, you're still sleeping.

1:01:30.224 --> 1:01:32.092
You were there.

1:01:32.127 --> 1:01:35.392
I saw you there.

1:01:35.427 --> 1:01:36.459
You're apart of this.

1:01:40.234 --> 1:01:42.465
Keziah has been using you
as a vessel for the birth

1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.907
of the Antichrist.

1:01:44.942 --> 1:01:48.108
Tommi, help me.

1:01:48.143 --> 1:01:51.276
This is the source of her power.

1:01:51.311 --> 1:01:54.917
Open the gateway, take it with
you and use it against her.

1:03:06.991 --> 1:03:07.352
It has begun.

1:03:16.528 --> 1:03:18.869
What do we do about Tommi?

1:03:18.904 --> 1:03:19.595
She's made her choice.

1:03:27.506 --> 1:03:28.978
It will be taken care of.

1:05:01.204 --> 1:05:02.236
Kill yourself.

1:05:03.767 --> 1:05:05.206
Kill yourself, Joe.

1:05:06.110 --> 1:05:10.013
Kill yourself, Joe.

1:05:10.048 --> 1:05:11.047
Kill yourself, Joe.

1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:19.187
You can do it.

1:05:26.757 --> 1:05:28.196
Kill yourself, Joe!

1:05:32.169 --> 1:05:33.399
Grab the razor.

1:05:41.211 --> 1:05:41.979
Grab the razor.

1:05:52.057 --> 1:05:55.091
Cut, cut, cut.

1:05:59.526 --> 1:06:02.164
Cut.

1:06:02.199 --> 1:06:04.166
Do it.

1:06:04.201 --> 1:06:05.167
Cut!

1:06:05.202 --> 1:06:07.565
Kill yourself, Joe.

1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:09.468
Cut.

1:06:40.567 --> 1:06:44.536
I love you, but you betrayed
the coven the coven.

1:08:03.683 --> 1:08:05.419
No more, Keziah.

1:08:58.243 --> 1:08:59.308
What do you want from me?

1:10:38.607 --> 1:10:39.309
No!

1:11:43.672 --> 1:11:46.442
Where's Kelly?

1:12:07.564 --> 1:12:12.798
Alice, why are you
running from me?

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:13.568
Just give me the knife.

1:12:19.741 --> 1:12:20.707
Just give me the knife.

1:12:24.042 --> 1:12:25.448
I know it's you, Keziah!

1:12:35.889 --> 1:12:39.154
Just give me the fucking knife!

1:15:01.936 --> 1:15:02.902
Alice?

1:15:02.937 --> 1:15:05.300
Alice.

1:15:05.335 --> 1:15:07.808
Alice?

1:15:07.843 --> 1:15:10.140
Kelly, what-- what the--

1:15:10.175 --> 1:15:11.911
what?

1:15:11.946 --> 1:15:15.211
What, what?

1:15:15.246 --> 1:15:16.212
What?

1:15:16.247 --> 1:15:17.213
Oh, my.

1:16:24.018 --> 1:16:32.827
You paint your
blue sky in isolated gray.

1:16:32.862 --> 1:16:37.865
Your birthday party is
now a headless masquerade.

1:16:40.804 --> 1:16:45.037
Blood on the rocks
and sun-bleached bones

1:16:45.072 --> 1:16:48.810
upon the shore.

1:16:48.845 --> 1:16:55.718
My leather heart's beating
a pathway to your door.

1:16:55.753 --> 1:17:00.657
You can't hide from
who you really are.

1:17:03.794 --> 1:17:08.995
You can't deny now
who you really are.

1:17:12.902 --> 1:17:16.365
Meek like a wax museum.

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:21.436
A room with a thousand eyes.

1:17:21.471 --> 1:17:26.782
Your rival hands now peel
the skin off your disguise.

1:17:29.820 --> 1:17:37.452
Big scars are deeper than
the footprints on the moon.

1:17:37.487 --> 1:17:44.162
Flies in the Milky Way, and
now elephants in the room.

1:17:44.197 --> 1:17:49.068
Engage the alarms and
lock the world outside.

1:17:52.469 --> 1:17:57.439
You can't hide now from
who you really are.

1:18:01.786 --> 1:18:06.250
One foot in the grave.

1:18:06.285 --> 1:18:14.225
The cross you bear is where
you'll hang, cast out and away.

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:18.031
Forget your past and
change your name.

1:18:35.985 --> 1:18:41.153
Witness protection
is so much safer now.

1:18:44.389 --> 1:18:49.326
Pack up all your fears
and move them out.

1:18:53.167 --> 1:18:57.070
Lay your heart in a
casket and dig it a hole.

1:18:57.105 --> 1:18:57.939
Make a wish.

1:18:57.974 --> 1:18:59.336
Crack a bone.

1:18:59.371 --> 1:19:00.975
You can do it alone.

1:19:01.010 --> 1:19:05.210
Mice and men, charlatans
hide in petrified trees.

1:19:05.245 --> 1:19:09.313
Crucified and denied,
sings the bird to the bees.

1:19:09.348 --> 1:19:13.449
One foot in the grave.

1:19:13.484 --> 1:19:21.457
The cross you bear is where
you'll hang, cast out and away.

1:19:21.492 --> 1:19:26.066
Forget your past and
change your name.

1:19:26.101 --> 1:19:34.206
You can't hide from
who you really are.

1:19:34.241 --> 1:19:42.115
You can't deny now
who you really are.

1:19:42.150 --> 1:19:47.450
Engage the alarms and
lock the world outside.

1:19:50.488 --> 1:19:55.293
You can't hide now from
who you really are.

1:20:00.003 --> 1:20:02.498
Lock the world outside.

1:20:08.110 --> 1:20:10.605
Lock the world outside.

1:20:16.514 --> 1:20:19.955
Lock the world outside.
