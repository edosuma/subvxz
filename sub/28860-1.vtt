MITCH: But I don't understand.

00:07.606 --> 00:09.388
JESSICA: We're just two
different people, Mitch.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.403
Of course we're two different people.

00:10.405 --> 00:12.165
We can't be the same person,
this isn't Fight Club.

00:12.167 --> 00:13.966
Argh, that's exactly what I mean.

00:13.968 --> 00:16.200
I don't even get that reference.

00:16.202 --> 00:18.027
What the heck is a Fight Club?

00:18.029 --> 00:19.259
Seriously?

00:19.261 --> 00:20.597
We don't speak the same language, Mitch.

00:20.599 --> 00:22.119
I'm sorry, but it's over.

00:22.121 --> 00:22.968
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay,

00:22.970 --> 00:24.814
you're right, you're right, you're right.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.339
We may not always speak
the same language here,

00:27.341 --> 00:31.138
but, baby, we speak the same
language right here, right?

00:31.140 --> 00:33.390
(SNEEZING)

00:36.278 --> 00:38.068
Oh my God.

00:38.070 --> 00:39.356
I'm bleeding.

00:39.358 --> 00:40.872
I'm bleeding!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.978
Do you see my teeth anywhere?

(UPBEAT MUSIC)

00:51.396 --> 00:53.867
So in the dream, I'm
on a date with this girl.

00:53.869 --> 00:56.152
I go to her doorstep, I get
a single rose behind my back.

00:56.154 --> 00:57.613
I pull it out to give it to her,

00:57.615 --> 01:00.000
it's not a rose anymore, man.

01:00.002 --> 01:01.085
It's a dildo.

01:02.134 --> 01:04.259
Yeah, so I toss that away.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.416
We're walking down the street.

01:05.418 --> 01:06.630
This little puppy comes
up to me, and I'm like,

01:06.632 --> 01:08.325
hey, puppy, and I go to pet it, touch him,

01:08.327 --> 01:11.413
boom, he turns into a dildo.

01:11.415 --> 01:13.421
I touch a mailbox, a
stop sign, a lamppost,

01:13.423 --> 01:15.090
dildo, dildo, dildo.

01:15.936 --> 01:17.334
Its like the Midas touch.

01:17.336 --> 01:19.078
But with dildos.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.520
Exactly, so I don't know what to do.

01:20.522 --> 01:21.749
I don't know what to do.

01:21.751 --> 01:23.514
She's all smiley, thinking
we're about to make out.

01:23.516 --> 01:27.030
She grabs my hand, and then, boom.

01:27.032 --> 01:28.462
That's when I wake up, screaming.

01:28.464 --> 01:31.414
Tears, urine, it's a mess.

01:31.416 --> 01:34.499
That's why I have plastic sheets now.

01:35.368 --> 01:37.699
You know what Freud
would say about that dream?

01:37.701 --> 01:38.579
What?

01:38.581 --> 01:41.127
That it's fucked up.

01:41.129 --> 01:43.897
Dreams are a gateway to the soul.

01:43.899 --> 01:46.491
I was studying dream interpretation
when I was channeling

01:46.493 --> 01:49.630
the Hindu god Vishnu on a pilgrimage

01:49.632 --> 01:52.438
through Angor Wat, Cambodia.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.848
Yeah, so what's your expert analysis?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.896
That it's f'ed up. (LAUGHING)

01:57.898 --> 01:59.287
Very funny guys, very, very funny.

01:59.289 --> 02:02.149
It's fucked up Mitch,
because you're a stud, my man.

02:02.151 --> 02:03.738
I mean you've got a
raging cock that's trying

02:03.740 --> 02:05.917
to express itself, and
you've lost your way.

02:05.919 --> 02:08.408
Hey, I was doing just
fine living on my own.

02:08.411 --> 02:10.144
You barely ever leave the house.

02:10.145 --> 02:11.694
Tonight you're coming out with us.

02:11.696 --> 02:12.695
For what?

02:12.697 --> 02:15.060
To get laid, to move on.

02:15.062 --> 02:15.893
Get laid?

02:15.895 --> 02:17.359
I can't even look at another girl.

02:17.361 --> 02:20.334
Jessica stole my heart,
man, I still love her.

02:20.336 --> 02:22.269
She didn't steal your heart Mitch, okay?

02:22.271 --> 02:24.388
She stole your balls
and I'm here to help you

02:24.390 --> 02:25.221
get 'em back.

02:25.223 --> 02:27.302
You know what, you never
supported our relationship.

02:27.304 --> 02:28.413
I should have been real
supportive when you caught

02:28.415 --> 02:29.799
her blowing the mailman.

02:29.801 --> 02:32.024
Hey, it was the Fed Ex guy.

02:32.026 --> 02:32.969
Forgive me Mitch, okay.

02:32.971 --> 02:34.683
The woman put a premium level
of care into helping men

02:34.685 --> 02:35.691
deliver loads.

02:35.693 --> 02:37.566
She's polyamorous, she's a free spirit.

02:37.568 --> 02:39.389
She's a selfish bitch.

02:39.391 --> 02:40.486
I wasn't meeting her needs.

02:40.488 --> 02:42.540
I mean she's a very powerful woman.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.680
I'm not saying come out
sarge some babes with us.

02:44.682 --> 02:45.622
That's hard work.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.854
That's why Jerry and I are
gonna be like the mama bird.

02:47.856 --> 02:49.233
(LAUGHING) Alright.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.250
We're gonna go out there,
lube up some lovely ladies,

02:51.252 --> 02:54.361
talk you up, get 'em wild and ready.

02:54.363 --> 02:58.766
You don't gotta do anything,
we'll do it all for you.

02:58.768 --> 03:00.192
Like the mama bird, we'll go out there,

03:00.194 --> 03:02.944
we'll catch the worm, chew it up,

03:04.580 --> 03:05.462
spit it into your mouth.

03:05.464 --> 03:06.638
That's disgusting.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.545
It's a metaphor.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.399
Yeah, I know it's a
metaphor, I know metaphors.

03:09.401 --> 03:10.412
It's a great fuckin' metaphor.

03:10.414 --> 03:12.363
It's not even close to a great metaphor.

03:12.365 --> 03:13.196
Phenomenal metaphor.

03:13.198 --> 03:14.475
It's not even a decent metaphor.

03:14.477 --> 03:15.980
Probably the best
metaphor you've ever heard.

03:15.982 --> 03:18.417
Here's the deal, I'm
still hurting, okay?

03:18.419 --> 03:19.346
I don't wanna go out.

03:19.348 --> 03:20.613
I know you're still
hurting Mitch, alright?

03:20.615 --> 03:22.068
This is gonna stop the hurt.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.781
You just need the next
lay, it's therapeutic.

03:25.783 --> 03:27.366
Like Jerry's Jelly.

03:28.221 --> 03:30.473
Jerry's Jelly, that again?

03:30.475 --> 03:32.059
It's happening Mitch.

03:32.061 --> 03:33.537
Dude, you've been saying that for years,

03:33.539 --> 03:35.366
you never do anything.

03:35.368 --> 03:37.427
We're gonna be rich.

03:37.429 --> 03:39.116
Not talking about it we're not.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.070
We're gonna be rich.

03:40.072 --> 03:44.066
I finally got the first
line ready for sale.

03:44.068 --> 03:45.337
Bam.

03:45.339 --> 03:46.170
Really?

03:46.172 --> 03:47.805
His own lines of
premium jams and jellies.

03:47.807 --> 03:49.897
It's from an old family recipes.

03:49.899 --> 03:53.538
It's something those suckers
at Smuckers can't compete with.

03:53.540 --> 03:54.710
Can't compete with it.

03:54.712 --> 03:55.882
Check that shit out.

03:55.884 --> 03:58.756
You're gonna love my jam in your mouth.

03:58.758 --> 04:00.841
Yes, you are, try some.

04:02.272 --> 04:03.762
Oh my God, what is that smell?

04:03.764 --> 04:05.745
Success my friend.

04:05.747 --> 04:06.787
Same kind of success you're gonna have

04:06.789 --> 04:08.079
when you come out with us tonight.

04:08.081 --> 04:08.986
Oh, I don't want this kind of success.

04:08.988 --> 04:10.538
That is not a good smell.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.266
Want me to go get the strawberry flavor?

04:12.268 --> 04:14.018
It'll blow your mind.

04:14.929 --> 04:17.305
Hm, this already did.

04:17.307 --> 04:19.958
I don't want to hold it, thank you.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.248
Mitch I don't want to
have to tell you this, man,

04:21.250 --> 04:23.138
but you have to come out with us tonight.

04:23.140 --> 04:24.586
Dude, do you not get it, no.

04:24.588 --> 04:28.204
It's Jerry, he thinks it's
his fault you're so miserable.

04:28.206 --> 04:30.116
That's ridiculous.

04:30.118 --> 04:31.535
Check that out.

04:33.035 --> 04:35.847
I thought this was like
some weird children's book.

04:35.849 --> 04:38.179
Hold on, you stole his diary?

04:38.181 --> 04:40.960
Journal Mitch, and no,
he asked me to read it.

04:40.962 --> 04:42.807
I don't think he knows what a journal is.

04:42.809 --> 04:45.027
And that's beside the
point, look at the drawing.

04:45.029 --> 04:46.186
He said something about
bringing a girl home

04:46.188 --> 04:48.274
and you going in your room and crying.

04:48.276 --> 04:50.098
Okay, okay, okay, in
my defense she looked

04:50.100 --> 04:51.764
a lot like Jessica.

04:51.766 --> 04:53.261
I had a couple drinks, started reminiscing

04:53.263 --> 04:57.013
and you know, things
got a tad bit emotional.

04:58.771 --> 05:01.485
He'll never tell you
man, but he feels horrible.

05:01.487 --> 05:03.416
He says he's not dating anymore.

05:03.418 --> 05:06.353
He says he's not gonna get
laid again until you do.

05:06.355 --> 05:08.819
I didn't know Jerry was
capable of actual human feelings.

05:08.821 --> 05:10.553
Even plants have feelings, Mitch.

05:10.555 --> 05:11.974
And Jerry's not a plant, he's a person

05:11.976 --> 05:13.556
and he's our friend.

05:13.558 --> 05:15.637
Now he's hurting because you're hurting.

05:15.639 --> 05:17.617
It's not just about you anymore.

05:17.619 --> 05:19.978
Okay, okay, okay fine, fine.

05:19.980 --> 05:23.151
I'll come out two hours tops.

05:23.153 --> 05:25.736

05:26.929 --> 05:28.792
What a lovely name.

05:28.794 --> 05:30.252
These look exactly the same, Jerry.

05:30.254 --> 05:31.682
It's my same face.

05:31.684 --> 05:33.945
I know, but I mean the
jellies, they look the same.

Mitch is coming out

05:35.389 --> 05:36.302

05:36.304 --> 05:37.353
Seriously?

05:37.355 --> 05:38.896
Let's not get too excited, huh?

05:38.898 --> 05:39.978
Just a couple hours.

05:39.980 --> 05:40.813
Yes.

get it in while you can.

I'm not dressing up.

gonna go get some brews

05:51.671 --> 05:52.502

We don't want to bury
it, so let's dump it

20:44.525 --> 20:45.368
in the garbage dump.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.267
No we'll be seen, it's too obvious.

20:47.269 --> 20:48.708
Fine, take it to the river.

panic attacks like this

21:27.744 --> 21:29.479
since his mom died, okay?

21:29.481 --> 21:30.819
Dude's got some problems.

21:30.821 --> 21:33.204
Back in the day you
call this guy a pussy

21:33.206 --> 21:34.283
he'd do anything.

21:34.285 --> 21:36.735
He'd fight motherfuckers twice his size.

21:36.737 --> 21:38.002
We called him the barbarian.

21:38.004 --> 21:41.246
But after his mom died he lost his edge.

21:41.248 --> 21:42.638
Breathe buddy, breathe, you okay?

21:42.640 --> 21:43.471
I'm good.

21:46.259 --> 21:50.066
Okay, okay, okay sorry, I'm such a spaz.

21:50.068 --> 21:52.597
So if you're in the middle of nowhere

21:52.599 --> 21:54.141
we could just bury him.

21:54.143 --> 21:54.974
Of course.

21:58.837 --> 21:59.920
Wait, what?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.798
That's it, we hide him in
plain sight like Heisenberg.

22:09.022 --> 22:09.853

22:11.404 --> 22:12.851
in tents, homeless people.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.458
Murders happen all the time there.

22:14.460 --> 22:16.575

and we just leave him there

22:16.577 --> 22:17.754
with a bunch of homeless people.

29:24.974 --> 29:26.324
doing really good.

29:26.326 --> 29:27.576
He's a patriot.

29:29.963 --> 29:30.796
Right.

29:33.269 --> 29:34.102
Hey buddy.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.985
(SNIFFS)

29:46.125 --> 29:47.208
Your friend...

29:49.194 --> 29:52.277
Hey Filer, come check this car out.

29:59.217 --> 30:00.911
We're so fucked, man.

30:00.913 --> 30:02.610
Calm down, alright, just breathe.

30:02.612 --> 30:04.288
I need you to breathe, alright.

30:04.290 --> 30:05.278
We're gonna make it through this.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.912
This is the car.

30:06.914 --> 30:07.825
The car.

30:07.827 --> 30:09.868
This is the car.

30:09.870 --> 30:11.737
I'll be damned.

30:11.739 --> 30:14.536
Sir, is this your vehicle?

30:14.538 --> 30:16.199
No officer.

30:16.201 --> 30:19.929
Dispatch, I need you to run a check.

30:19.931 --> 30:22.931
200 parking tickets and we found it.

30:23.772 --> 30:25.827
We win the pool. (LAUGHING)

30:25.829 --> 30:27.246
They play pool.

30:29.766 --> 30:32.655
Gentlemen, have a good night.

30:32.657 --> 30:35.601
Be safe, make sure he gets home.

30:35.603 --> 30:36.801
Okay.

30:36.803 --> 30:38.500
Oh we will officer, we will.

30:38.502 --> 30:39.450
Bye-bye asshole.

30:39.452 --> 30:40.285
Bye.

30:42.699 --> 30:44.632
Jerry, why'd you lie about the car?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.940
There are no lies, only hidden truths.

30:47.942 --> 30:50.626
Thank God for your incompetence.

30:50.628 --> 30:53.038
Now this is good though,
this is really good, okay?

30:53.040 --> 30:56.145
We just need to not see anybody
else in this neighborhood

30:56.147 --> 30:58.026
and we'll be fine.

30:58.028 --> 30:58.859
Hey man.

30:58.861 --> 31:00.102
Oh hey.

31:00.104 --> 31:02.125
Why is there a guy in a
suit walking around Jerry?

31:02.127 --> 31:03.819
You were supposed to take
us to a deserted part

31:03.821 --> 31:04.802
of Skid Row.

31:04.804 --> 31:07.239
I don't know, I just saw
a guy pissing in the street.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.608
That could be anywhere in downtown L.A.

31:09.610 --> 31:12.277
So then where the hell are we?

31:18.173 --> 31:19.673
- Oh shit.
- Jesus.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.187
No no no, this is good, this is good.

31:22.189 --> 31:23.880
We can blend, we can blend.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.039
What do you mean blend, dude?

31:26.041 --> 31:28.535
Um no no no no, they'll
think he's drunk, man.

31:28.537 --> 31:30.717
We'll be alright, we'll be okay.

31:30.719 --> 31:31.885
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God.

31:31.887 --> 31:32.839
I'm getting tired
though, I'm getting tired.

31:32.841 --> 31:34.563
Let's put him down for a
second, let's put him down.

31:34.565 --> 31:35.735
Put him down.

31:35.737 --> 31:38.237
MITCH: Get rid of him, man.

31:39.225 --> 31:43.558
CHARLIE: Alright just
put him here, put him here.

31:47.485 --> 31:48.676
Dude, come here.

31:48.678 --> 31:49.509
We need to get the hell out of here.

31:49.511 --> 31:51.580
There are people like everywhere, man.

31:51.582 --> 31:54.793
We'll figure it out,
we'll figure it out, okay?

31:54.795 --> 31:57.982
Let's just dump his body in the dumpster.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.474
No we can't, Charlie.

31:59.476 --> 32:00.891
Two cops just saw us with Wally.

32:00.893 --> 32:01.733
Valid point.

32:01.735 --> 32:03.636
Let's just take him back
to the alley, alright?

32:03.638 --> 32:04.973
We'll call a cab, we'll just lay low.

32:04.975 --> 32:07.093
Everything will be fine.

32:07.095 --> 32:09.102
We can't wait for a cab, man.

32:09.104 --> 32:10.092
People are gonna find us in the alley.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.036
Everyone knows to check in an alley

32:11.038 --> 32:11.869
when there's dead bodies.

32:11.871 --> 32:13.451
We've got no choice man, come on.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.339
Just calm down, Mitch.

32:14.341 --> 32:17.054
Settle down, settle down,
everything's gonna be fine.

32:17.056 --> 32:17.887
Jerry's not helping.

32:17.889 --> 32:19.797
We'll figure this out, okay?

32:19.799 --> 32:20.815
It will be fine.

32:20.817 --> 32:22.234
Where is Jerry?

32:23.790 --> 32:26.761
Ah fuck Jerry, man, where's Wally?

32:26.763 --> 32:28.763
Oh shit, Jerry, Jerry.

32:32.445 --> 32:35.495
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

You are such a good listener.

(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

32:50.994 --> 32:52.705
How does she not notice he's dead?

32:52.707 --> 32:54.002
Dude, let's get him out of here now.

32:54.004 --> 32:55.813
Alright, chin up Mitch.

32:55.815 --> 32:57.916
It's dark in here, we're off the streets.

32:57.918 --> 33:00.674
You just gotta stick
together and play it cool.

Oh, like Jerry?

33:02.335 --> 33:05.431
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

33:05.433 --> 33:06.872
Well at least he's blending.

33:06.874 --> 33:08.642
Can we drop him at the bar, please?

33:08.644 --> 33:10.366
Fine, drop him at the bar.

33:10.368 --> 33:13.201
Come here Wally, come on, come on.

33:19.028 --> 33:21.419
Alright drop him down, there we go.

33:21.421 --> 33:24.097
Wally you're a stud, my man, yes you are.

33:24.099 --> 33:25.881
You stick with Wally,
I'm gonna go call a cab.

33:25.883 --> 33:28.381
What? No no no, Charlie, Charlie.

33:28.383 --> 33:30.550
Yeah, he's a little drunk.

33:32.901 --> 33:34.760
You guys are pretty close, huh?

33:34.762 --> 33:37.304
What? No we aren't.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.882
Your friend's really
getting around tonight.

33:39.884 --> 33:42.463
It's not what it looks like.

33:42.465 --> 33:43.935
What does it look like?

33:43.937 --> 33:45.710
Well it looks like
he's trying to suck my,

33:45.712 --> 33:46.543
but he's not.

33:46.545 --> 33:48.628
He's just, this is Wally.

33:50.556 --> 33:51.831
Wally just got wasted.

33:51.833 --> 33:53.589
He looks fucked up.

33:53.591 --> 33:56.145
Yeah, it's been a long night.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.730
Yeah, I can tell.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.544
I was just fucking with you, by the way.

34:01.546 --> 34:04.286
Oh cool, that's really not nice.

34:04.288 --> 34:06.093
I just, I can't stand drunk guys.

34:06.095 --> 34:07.073
Me either.

34:07.075 --> 34:09.335
I was at the bar with my
brother and my roommate,

34:09.337 --> 34:12.466
but he got shit-faced and ditched me.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.801
Oh that sucks.

34:14.987 --> 34:16.737
What happened here?

34:18.531 --> 34:22.195
Uh, my roommates took me
out because my girlfriend

34:22.197 --> 34:23.353
and I broke up.

34:23.356 --> 34:26.492
Well I'm sure the next
girl's right around the corner.

34:26.494 --> 34:28.473
It's more of a tiff really.

34:28.475 --> 34:30.606
We're meant to be together, so.

34:30.608 --> 34:32.440
Oh, so like destiny.

34:33.722 --> 34:35.397
Yes, thank you.

34:35.399 --> 34:37.185
How long ago did you guys break up?

34:37.187 --> 34:40.085
Approximately 192 days, three hours.

34:40.088 --> 34:44.505
Oh, oh, that's, that's
like a really long time ago.

34:46.023 --> 34:49.009
No it's not, it's like
a quarter of two years.

34:49.011 --> 34:51.252
Like that lyric from the Journey song.

34:51.254 --> 34:53.458
Yeah, you know what, you
seem like a nice person.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.070
But could you leave me alone?

Oh.

be here in 20 minutes.

I still don't see why we
couldn't go one at a time.

36:00.612 --> 36:03.605
I can't go if you keep talking.

36:03.607 --> 36:04.884
Funny Charlie, I can't
go because I'm holding up

36:04.886 --> 36:06.988
a dead guy while my dick's hanging out.

I can't believe Wally's
even friends with you guys.

37:02.485 --> 37:04.657
No seriously like how
do you know his name?

And maybe some other body parts, too.

37:23.628 --> 37:25.784
You know, on second
thought, Wally should come.

37:25.786 --> 37:26.838
Should be a guys' event.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.555
Let's do a dudes' trip to the store.

37:29.557 --> 37:32.422
Wally is a gentleman,
he'll insist on paying.

37:32.424 --> 37:33.631
Awesome.

38:02.392 --> 38:05.051
but the police don't miss it either, man.

38:05.053 --> 38:07.996
If anything it makes him
look like he was alive tonight.

38:07.998 --> 38:10.691
Or, killed him, stole
his credit card and went

38:10.693 --> 38:12.215
on a shopping spree.

38:12.217 --> 38:14.641
I hardly think a couple
of beers and a little bit

38:14.643 --> 38:16.517
of hard A qualifies as spree.

38:16.519 --> 38:17.657
Oh that's great Charlie,
glad to see you're really

38:17.659 --> 38:18.490
growing as a person.

38:18.492 --> 38:19.825
Hey Mom, look.

38:20.702 --> 38:22.035
Don't be rude.

38:25.209 --> 38:27.126
He's a big boy today.

38:30.086 --> 38:32.864
I don't always drink
beer, but when I do.

38:32.866 --> 38:34.809
What are you doing man, this is serious.

38:34.811 --> 38:38.831
Calm down, relax, the
universe has everything

38:38.833 --> 38:40.000
under control.

38:42.312 --> 38:43.885
The universe?

38:43.887 --> 38:44.718
Yeah.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.192
I'm sorry Jerry, is
that the same universe

38:46.194 --> 38:49.332
that had me trip and accidentally
stab this motherfucker?

38:49.334 --> 38:51.037
Then had you get our transportation towed

38:51.039 --> 38:52.778
because you don't know how
to pay a parking ticket?

38:52.780 --> 38:54.427
And is this the same universe
where we got assaulted

38:54.429 --> 38:56.619
in a bathroom, and that
same guy is now chasing us

38:56.621 --> 38:59.311
around L.A. while we
parade a dead body around

38:59.313 --> 39:01.606
in a fucking shopping cart?

39:01.608 --> 39:03.441
Yeah, same universe.

Hey, hey, hey, hey come
on man, take a chill pill.

39:08.570 --> 39:12.712
Yeah Mitch, relax,
you're projecting big time.

39:12.714 --> 39:14.144
Projecting, I'm projecting.

39:14.146 --> 39:16.573
Yeah, I'm projecting, what
are you Sigmund fucking Freud?

39:23.477 --> 39:25.648
a random mugger, okay, trying to catch us

39:25.650 --> 39:27.714
with our pants down literally.

39:27.716 --> 39:28.774
No he wasn't, Charlie.

39:28.776 --> 39:31.881
He chased after us, he
yelled Wally's name.

39:31.883 --> 39:33.521
He didn't yell Wally's name.

39:33.523 --> 39:34.602
Yes he did!

You were fucking, dude,
muggers don't do that.

39:37.770 --> 39:38.937
They run away.

39:40.494 --> 39:42.802
Maybe he was a really committed mugger.

39:42.804 --> 39:44.650
Yeah, I bet he's really
just committed to his craft.

39:44.652 --> 39:46.606
I bet he got an A plus in mugging school.

I can argue about this all day with you.

39:50.906 --> 39:53.605
But right now we have a
dead body in a grocery store

39:53.607 --> 39:55.314
and we need to keep up appearances.

39:55.316 --> 39:57.284
Yes we do, but what about
those girls out there?

39:57.286 --> 39:59.393
Sooner or later they're gonna
get wind of Wally's condition.

39:59.395 --> 40:01.124
Fine, we'll ditch 'em right now.

40:01.126 --> 40:02.556
Alright we'll just slip out
of here, we'll call a cab,

40:02.558 --> 40:05.769
we'll get on with our night
and what we have to do.

40:05.771 --> 40:06.604

50:29.781 --> 50:31.245
Wait that seems really stupid.

50:31.247 --> 50:33.272
It's called the cinnamon challenge.

50:33.274 --> 50:35.763
People do it, they basically eat cinnamon

50:35.765 --> 50:37.353
and then record themselves choking.

50:37.355 --> 50:38.409
It's hilarious.

50:38.411 --> 50:41.144
Your guy over there, I don't know.

50:41.146 --> 50:42.896
You need to see this.

50:45.337 --> 50:48.184
Yo Wally Zwas here, about
to do the cinnamon challenge.

50:48.186 --> 50:49.554
Y'all think this stuff's hard?

50:49.556 --> 50:50.911
Give me a break, man.

50:50.913 --> 50:52.450
You're about to see the
cinnamon challenge in ways

50:52.452 --> 50:53.880
you've never seen it before.

50:53.882 --> 50:55.465
You ready for this?

50:56.560 --> 51:00.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, how
many views does that have?

51:00.561 --> 51:03.244
LUCY: Like 130 million.

51:03.246 --> 51:05.413
MITCH: I'm sorry, what?

51:06.818 --> 51:07.649
Piece of cake.

51:07.651 --> 51:09.215
He's the only guy in the world to beat

51:09.217 --> 51:11.134
the cinnamon challenge.

51:12.056 --> 51:13.621
Oh my God, he's famous.

51:13.623 --> 51:14.456
Yeah.

51:16.187 --> 51:19.531
We have a famous friend, huh.

51:19.533 --> 51:23.093
He's so humble he doesn't talk about it.

51:23.095 --> 51:25.845
I'm gonna kill him, just kidding.

51:31.757 --> 51:36.257
Give him to me, I only
need him for like 10 minutes.

51:38.695 --> 51:42.328
I'm sorry sir, we're just
trying to meet somebody.

51:42.330 --> 51:44.127
So we'll get out of here.

51:44.129 --> 51:45.778
And what do we have here?

51:45.780 --> 51:49.044
Three drunk ninnies from
the gen pop invading

51:49.046 --> 51:50.463
our sacred space.

51:52.168 --> 51:53.501
Well go get 'em!

51:56.924 --> 52:00.591
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

52:03.911 --> 52:05.328
Wait a parsecond.

52:08.456 --> 52:11.789
Wait a goddamn motherfucking nanosecond.

52:13.149 --> 52:16.649
Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit.

52:17.621 --> 52:19.523
It's an honor and a pleasure
to have a man of your caliber

52:19.525 --> 52:21.108
in my humble abode.

52:21.970 --> 52:26.970
I'm Randall, Randall Edgerton
and this is my little soiree.

52:27.654 --> 52:30.571
Please, gentlemen come have a seat.

52:37.574 --> 52:40.235
Gentlemen, I'm a little sorry
about what happened earlier.

52:40.237 --> 52:44.792
I had no idea that I was
addressing an officer

52:44.794 --> 52:48.475
and a scholar such as yourself, Wally.

52:48.477 --> 52:52.894
You and I (KNOCKS) shall brake coke.

52:54.675 --> 52:57.175
Let's engineer some memories.

52:57.177 --> 53:00.237
It's not every day you get
to do blow with the man

53:00.239 --> 53:03.322
who conquered the cinnamon challenge.

53:04.433 --> 53:05.516
He's Wally.

53:07.433 --> 53:10.100

53:30.339 --> 53:32.089
It would be an honor.

53:33.138 --> 53:35.233
Yeah sure, yeah.

53:35.235 --> 53:37.310
Wally loves his coke, he loves it.

53:37.312 --> 53:39.562
He's so, he loves it a lot.

53:48.369 --> 53:49.369
He loves it.

53:54.279 --> 53:55.393
What's the problem?

53:55.395 --> 53:57.501
Wally's digested a
lot of cocaine already

53:57.503 --> 53:58.923
and a lot of alcohol.

53:58.925 --> 54:03.925
Now I just think he's been
partying like 12 hours straight.

54:04.111 --> 54:08.850
I don't think he can digest
anymore cocaine at all,

54:08.852 --> 54:10.185
none whatsoever.

54:16.807 --> 54:21.807
(SIGHS) Okay, I get
a little enthusiastic

54:21.989 --> 54:23.406
at these parties.

54:24.661 --> 54:28.187
Reminds me of my younger days, you know?

54:28.189 --> 54:31.437
You guys probably want
to get back to the party,

54:31.439 --> 54:32.880
get laid.

54:32.882 --> 54:34.213
I'd love to go back to the party.

54:34.215 --> 54:35.573
I think that's a great idea.

54:35.575 --> 54:38.926
Then forget about me sitting
in this back room here.

54:38.928 --> 54:41.692
I would never forget about you ever.

Desperately trying to
cling to that one last

a feeling of what it is

54:47.731 --> 54:49.273
to be alive.

54:49.275 --> 54:51.275
But Wally, you're right.

54:54.383 --> 54:57.133
Coke doesn't do it, not any more.

55:04.608 --> 55:05.941
It's not enough.

55:11.370 --> 55:13.982
You wanna play games with me, Wally?

55:13.984 --> 55:18.984
Wanna play a game, now we're
gonna play a man's game.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.411
(LAUGHING) It's a good party.

55:20.413 --> 55:21.246
Right?

55:24.222 --> 55:25.472
Uh, I gotta go.

55:28.157 --> 55:29.432
Uh okay.

55:56.067 --> 55:59.456
so I certainly can't trust
you to pull the trigger.

55:59.458 --> 56:00.979
So you know what?

56:00.981 --> 56:03.870
I'm gonna do that for everybody.

wanna do this, Wally?

they're right behind us.

01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:47.377
One, two, three.

01:03:55.259 --> 01:03:56.759
Oh fuck my life.

01:04:00.738 --> 01:04:03.869
Oh we can do it, we can do it, come on.

01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:04.954
We can do it.

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:10.079
Come on, hurry.

01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:12.248
Oh shit, come on, come on.

01:04:19.242 --> 01:04:21.701
AUTOMATED VOICE: The doors are closing.

01:04:21.703 --> 01:04:22.536
Oh shit.

01:04:28.008 --> 01:04:30.258
Dude, who are those guys?

01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:32.332
Why are they following us?

01:04:32.334 --> 01:04:33.584
Uh what guys?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.227
The dudes that are
chasing us with the gun.

01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:41.509
Oh I thought they were
just running. (LAUGHING)

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.342
What are we gonna do?

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:43.962
They could be booking it to
the next station right now.

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:45.620
I have no idea man, okay?

01:04:45.622 --> 01:04:48.205
I didn't expect this to happen.

01:04:50.813 --> 01:04:55.813
(LAUGHING) Hey look,
Wally's trying to cheer us up.

01:04:59.374 --> 01:05:01.332
Hey you got her number.

01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:03.103
No dude, this is Jessica's new number.

01:05:03.105 --> 01:05:04.184
What?

01:05:04.186 --> 01:05:06.221
I mean maybe all of this is
happening for a reason, right?

01:05:06.223 --> 01:05:07.507
Snap out of it, man, okay?

01:05:07.509 --> 01:05:09.295
The woman's toxic, she's
probably just using you

01:05:09.297 --> 01:05:11.074
to get closer to Wally.

01:05:11.076 --> 01:05:12.592
No dude, this is destiny.

01:05:12.594 --> 01:05:15.541
Did you even get that
other girl's number?

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:16.723
Who?

01:05:16.725 --> 01:05:20.975
The girl that was laughing
with you at the party.

01:05:22.366 --> 01:05:23.600
Oh shit, I don't believe it.

01:05:23.602 --> 01:05:26.803
Yeah, I don't believe it either.

01:05:26.805 --> 01:05:28.555
No dude look, shit.

01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:31.277
Holy shit.

01:05:31.279 --> 01:05:32.171
JERRY: What?

01:05:32.173 --> 01:05:33.456
Jerry, it's your car.

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.991
JERRY: Over here on the train?

01:05:34.993 --> 01:05:36.743
No man, down there.

01:05:40.693 --> 01:05:41.526
Huh.

01:05:42.377 --> 01:05:47.044
I've got an idea, let's get
Wally and get out of this.

01:05:48.268 --> 01:05:51.935
Okay let's put him down,
let's put him down.

01:05:53.335 --> 01:05:55.168
I got him, here we go.

01:05:57.472 --> 01:05:59.302
I told you man I used to
be a tow truck driver.

01:05:59.304 --> 01:06:01.213
I'll have that thing down in like no time.

01:06:01.215 --> 01:06:02.972
What about the driver?

01:06:02.974 --> 01:06:05.247
We create a diversion.

01:06:05.249 --> 01:06:06.840
Diversion, what is this, Scooby-Doo?

01:06:06.842 --> 01:06:08.156
What's the big plan, Velma?

01:06:08.158 --> 01:06:10.317
I'm trying to be
constructive here Mitch, okay?

01:06:10.319 --> 01:06:12.889
Constructive, do you
see our present situation?

01:06:12.891 --> 01:06:14.528
You want to create a
diversion while you steal

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:16.515
a car off of a tow truck.

01:06:16.517 --> 01:06:18.524
There's no such thing as stealing.

01:06:18.526 --> 01:06:20.263
I don't believe in possessions.

01:06:20.265 --> 01:06:21.096
Oh fuck off Jerry.

01:06:21.098 --> 01:06:22.237
It's Jerry's car Mitch, alright?

01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:23.151
Grow a sack.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:24.855
This is so ridiculous.

01:06:24.857 --> 01:06:25.799
You got a better idea?

01:06:25.801 --> 01:06:27.727
Wally has a better plan than this.

01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:29.693
(YELLING)

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.287
That's not Wally.

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:32.548
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:34.831
Sherlock? My name's Jerry.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:35.726
I told you that.

01:06:35.728 --> 01:06:36.995
Where the fuck did he go?

01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:38.434
Where the fuck is Wally, man?

01:06:38.436 --> 01:06:40.180
We must have left him on the train, man.

01:06:40.182 --> 01:06:41.884
We're never gonna catch that train, man.

01:06:41.886 --> 01:06:43.663
We need Jerry's car.

01:06:43.665 --> 01:06:45.334
Fine, what's the plan,
what's the diversion?

01:06:45.336 --> 01:06:48.871
I got it okay, you go up
to the tow truck driver.

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:52.407
You say hey my friend's
passed out, we need your help.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.810
I go over to the car, we go.

01:06:53.812 --> 01:06:55.041
How are you gonna work that thing?

01:06:55.043 --> 01:06:57.260
I told you man, I used
to be a tow truck driver.

01:06:57.262 --> 01:06:59.259
I was like the Michael Phelps of towing.

01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:02.198
That's a great plan,
just give me a second

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.789
to get into character.

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.494
Jerry no, we already
have this guy passed out.

01:07:05.496 --> 01:07:06.867
We don't need you to pass out.

01:07:06.869 --> 01:07:08.340
Now let me focus.

01:07:08.342 --> 01:07:11.823
When I was in Thailand I learned
how to slow my heart rate

01:07:11.825 --> 01:07:12.967
to an almost undetectable level.

01:07:12.969 --> 01:07:15.710
It's a combination of
self-induced hypnosis

01:07:15.712 --> 01:07:17.277
and meditation.

01:07:17.279 --> 01:07:18.272
What, no.

01:07:18.274 --> 01:07:20.998
Jerry we don't need you to do that.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.373
Yes you do.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:25.375
Once I'm out you won't be able to....

01:07:26.528 --> 01:07:27.573
Jerry.

01:07:27.575 --> 01:07:28.730
Oh my God, is he dead?

01:07:28.732 --> 01:07:29.972
JERRY: (laughing) Oh God.

01:07:29.974 --> 01:07:30.928
He's fine, he's fine.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:31.761
I can't take this anymore.

01:07:31.763 --> 01:07:33.322
We have two people now passed out.

01:07:33.324 --> 01:07:34.635
Ah shit, shit, shit.

01:07:34.637 --> 01:07:36.109
Mitch, Mitch, yes, yes panic.

01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:37.386
Panic like a champion.

01:07:37.388 --> 01:07:38.363
You can do that right, right?

01:07:38.365 --> 01:07:40.344
Yeah, I can't stop myself.

01:07:40.346 --> 01:07:41.721
Well go distract that
motherfucker so we can

01:07:41.723 --> 01:07:42.854
get the hell outta here.

01:07:42.856 --> 01:07:47.020
Okay, okay, okay, help,
help, help, help, help.

01:07:47.022 --> 01:07:48.355
Sir, help, help.

01:07:50.117 --> 01:07:51.045
You okay, man?

01:07:51.047 --> 01:07:52.821
No, my friends are like on the ground.

01:07:52.823 --> 01:07:54.389
I don't know what happened to them, man.

01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:55.735
You should go help.

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:56.570
Oh shit.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.403
You sure?

01:07:57.405 --> 01:08:00.988
Yeah, I don't know,
they don't look good.

01:08:02.026 --> 01:08:04.222
Aw man, they're dead.

01:08:04.224 --> 01:08:07.178
Alright you can do
this, you can do this.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.263
What the fuck am I doing?

01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:14.130
How the?

01:08:15.154 --> 01:08:17.071
They're not dead, they're not dead.

01:08:19.648 --> 01:08:20.981
They're alive.

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:23.555
Yeah, but just barely.

01:08:23.558 --> 01:08:25.578
That one's unconscious but he's breathing.

01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.938
This one, I think his heart stopped.

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:30.408
Look you stay here, I've
gotta go back to the truck.

01:08:30.411 --> 01:08:31.242
Wait what?

01:08:31.243 --> 01:08:32.075

Don't leave me, don't leave.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.500
Hey, calm down okay, I'll be right back.

I've got two people down.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.953
They are unconscious, I
need an ambulance stat.

01:09:00.955 --> 01:09:02.684
Also I think they've been laid out

01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:05.435
so get some cops here quick okay?

Oh yes, his heart stopped.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.234
I don't think it's
really stopped though.

01:09:41.237 --> 01:09:42.420
No, no no no.

01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:45.865
Oh yes, there's no fuckin'
time, his heart stopped.

01:12:32.543 --> 01:12:34.293
you fat, flaky, fuck.

01:12:35.465 --> 01:12:36.773
You think I'm fat?

01:12:36.775 --> 01:12:39.002
I've been doing a cleanse.

01:12:39.004 --> 01:12:40.314
We stopped at a burger
joint because this fucker's

01:12:40.316 --> 01:12:41.624
on a cleanse.

01:12:41.626 --> 01:12:42.849
How do you like that?

01:12:42.851 --> 01:12:44.777
Great, hallelujah man.

01:12:44.779 --> 01:12:46.612
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.

01:12:47.775 --> 01:12:50.073
Hey, we didn't stab anybody, man, you did.

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.709
We were just trying to help.

01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:53.068
Hold on, Mitch hold on.

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:54.186
MITCH: Leave me alone, dude.

01:12:54.188 --> 01:12:55.816
CHARLIE: Mitch, hold on, man.

01:12:55.818 --> 01:12:57.863
Mitch, hold on.

01:12:57.865 --> 01:12:59.905
Mitch, Mitch where the fuck are you going?

01:12:59.907 --> 01:13:02.879
So fucked, Charlie, I'm just fucked.

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:05.524
Man this is over, tonight
has been a fuckin' disaster.

01:13:05.526 --> 01:13:06.357
You're right, okay?

01:13:06.359 --> 01:13:07.830
Tonight has been a disaster, man.

01:13:07.832 --> 01:13:09.650
But you're not fucked, okay?

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:12.937
You didn't mean to kill that
guy, and that's the truth.

01:13:12.939 --> 01:13:15.547
You have at least one
eyewitness willing to testify

01:13:15.549 --> 01:13:16.382
to that.

01:13:17.382 --> 01:13:20.165
Wait, you'd lie under oath for me?

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:21.667
Yeah, fuck yeah.

01:13:22.723 --> 01:13:24.405
You do know you could
go to jail for like

01:13:24.407 --> 01:13:25.990
a long time, right?

01:13:28.554 --> 01:13:29.995
Well I mean we'll talk
about that later, alright?

01:13:29.997 --> 01:13:31.009
It's not the point.

01:13:31.011 --> 01:13:33.011
The point is it was an accident.

01:13:33.013 --> 01:13:35.336
People make mistakes, Mitch.

01:13:35.338 --> 01:13:37.615
Look at Nicholas Cage.

01:13:37.617 --> 01:13:39.367
You're gonna be okay.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.366
Whatever, man.

01:13:45.368 --> 01:13:48.570
I am fucked and we both know it.

01:13:48.572 --> 01:13:50.155
Let's just go home.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.007
Jerry come on man, we're going home.

01:14:07.612 --> 01:14:09.291
What about Dale?

01:14:09.293 --> 01:14:11.219
Who the fuck is Dale?

01:14:11.221 --> 01:14:13.199
Oh right, the random
drunk guy you picked up

01:14:13.201 --> 01:14:14.926
instead of our corpse.

01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:17.261
Shh, not in front of Dale.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.863
I got this, I've been doing
this way too much lately.

01:14:27.657 --> 01:14:30.697
This guy lives about five miles away.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:31.532
So what?

01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:36.125
So we take him home.

01:14:36.127 --> 01:14:38.909
We should at least do one good
deed for the night, right?

01:14:38.911 --> 01:14:41.879
Wait a minute, that's
your move right now?

01:14:41.881 --> 01:14:44.798
Mitch, what else are we gonna do?

01:14:46.851 --> 01:14:50.851
Fine, it's not like
tonight can get any worse.

01:14:51.777 --> 01:14:53.697
(LAUGHING)

01:14:53.699 --> 01:14:56.282
Shit, I guess you were wrong.

01:15:00.406 --> 01:15:03.401
I don't like this at all.

01:15:03.403 --> 01:15:04.570
Guys, come on.

01:15:16.598 --> 01:15:18.937
Guys, what are we doing?

01:15:18.939 --> 01:15:22.275
Well earlier you killed this guy, Wally.

01:15:22.277 --> 01:15:24.076
So we spent the night running around town

01:15:24.078 --> 01:15:26.300
trying to get rid of the body.

01:15:26.302 --> 01:15:28.053
I don't need a recap, Jerry.

01:15:28.055 --> 01:15:29.632
We're seriously gonna walk
into a dark, strange house

01:15:29.634 --> 01:15:31.424
with some drunk guy?

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.611
If anybody was here
they'd be up already.

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:36.232
Just get him in his bed
and get out of here.

01:15:36.234 --> 01:15:37.631
Fine.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.716
I've gotta take a leak.

01:15:49.329 --> 01:15:51.246
Someone's in the bed.

01:15:53.656 --> 01:15:55.587
I told you this is a bad idea.

01:15:55.589 --> 01:15:56.745
You woke him up.

01:15:56.747 --> 01:15:58.375
What do you mean I woke
him up, you woke him,

01:15:58.377 --> 01:15:59.208
we woke him.

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:00.041
- Shh.
- Shh.

01:16:00.043 --> 01:16:00.888
- Shh.
- Shh.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:01.973
- Shh.
- Shh.

01:16:07.164 --> 01:16:07.997
Fuck.

01:16:09.045 --> 01:16:10.386
Now what?

01:16:10.388 --> 01:16:14.555
(LIGHTHEARTED INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

01:16:24.463 --> 01:16:26.303
What the fuck does that mean?

01:16:26.305 --> 01:16:29.731
It means we get the fuck out of here.

01:16:29.733 --> 01:16:30.611
Just say that next time.

01:16:30.613 --> 01:16:32.732
Come on and help me.

01:16:32.734 --> 01:16:34.067
Fucking crazy.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:44.743
Alright, here we go.

01:16:47.137 --> 01:16:48.096
What the fuck you drop him?

01:16:48.098 --> 01:16:50.765
I didn't drop him, he slipped.

01:16:52.218 --> 01:16:53.827
What's up, guys?

01:16:53.829 --> 01:16:54.700
Jerry, turn off the light.

01:16:54.702 --> 01:16:56.055
Turn the fuckin' light off.

01:16:56.057 --> 01:16:57.474
Ah, it's Wally.

01:16:58.834 --> 01:16:59.834
Holy shit.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.641
Oh my God.

01:17:02.643 --> 01:17:04.098
Those guys must have
been so wasted they thought

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.314
Wally was Dale.

01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:07.160
I've never been so happy to
see a dead body in my life.

01:17:07.162 --> 01:17:09.579
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:13.454
(SCREAMING)

01:17:13.456 --> 01:17:14.287
Oh my God.

01:17:14.289 --> 01:17:15.120
So sorry.

01:17:15.122 --> 01:17:17.136
Oh my God, Mitch?

01:17:17.138 --> 01:17:17.969
We're just gonna go.

01:17:17.971 --> 01:17:19.031
Mitch?

01:17:19.033 --> 01:17:20.277
Wait, Lucy?

01:17:20.279 --> 01:17:21.953
Is your friend okay?

01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:24.572
Oh he's good, don't worry about him.

01:17:24.574 --> 01:17:26.084
Jesus Mitch, I thought
you were gonna kill me

01:17:26.086 --> 01:17:29.146
or throw me in the tar pit.

01:17:29.148 --> 01:17:30.623
Tar pit.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.184
Why didn't we think of that?

01:17:32.186 --> 01:17:33.209
What?

01:17:33.211 --> 01:17:36.044
He's just joking, tar pit jokes.

01:17:36.949 --> 01:17:39.746
Wally's got a big day
tomorrow and still more stuff

01:17:39.748 --> 01:17:41.906
to do tonight, so I'm gonna
go put him in the car.

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:43.491
Put him in, yeah put him in the car.

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:44.466
In the car for Wally.

01:17:44.468 --> 01:17:46.547
In the car we go.

01:17:46.549 --> 01:17:51.338
Have a fun time, we're gonna
leave you alone, alrighty.

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:53.840
It's not what it looks like?

01:17:55.025 --> 01:17:58.275
So you don't have vomit all over you?

01:17:59.824 --> 01:18:02.907
It's not my vomit, but it is vomit.

01:18:04.313 --> 01:18:07.396
You're a mess, let me clean you up.

01:18:08.555 --> 01:18:12.172
Thank you for the non-vomit shirt.

01:18:12.174 --> 01:18:13.669
So you still haven't
told me what you're doing

01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:16.803
at my brother's house in
the middle of the night.

01:18:16.805 --> 01:18:18.988
Yeah, I have not.

01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.819
It's, uh, kind of creepy.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.230
Is it creepy or you know,
maybe like kind of charming?

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:24.525
It's creepy.

01:18:24.527 --> 01:18:27.924
Okay yeah, we saw this
drunk passed out guy

01:18:27.926 --> 01:18:29.064
and checked his driver's license.

01:18:29.066 --> 01:18:31.168
It said Dale Huffington
so we thought we'd be good

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:33.229
Samaritans, bring him
home, put him to bed.

01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:35.790
Wow, that's my brother.

01:18:35.792 --> 01:18:38.292
He's a dumb ass, so thank you.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.498
You are very welcome.

01:18:42.977 --> 01:18:44.644
What are the odds?

01:18:46.048 --> 01:18:48.927
I know, it's kinda crazy.

01:18:48.929 --> 01:18:51.179
It's almost like destiny.

01:18:52.283 --> 01:18:54.200
Yeah, feels that way.

01:18:55.285 --> 01:18:58.952
Except, except I still
have that girlfriend.

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:02.300
That's a thing.

01:19:04.556 --> 01:19:06.878
Sorry to interrupt.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.020
Wally's got a problem
that we need to go bury,

01:19:10.022 --> 01:19:12.042
you know like prehistoric.

01:19:12.044 --> 01:19:13.694
Yes, yes we do.

01:19:13.696 --> 01:19:17.580
Wally has a date with
history, you could say.

01:19:17.582 --> 01:19:20.609
Yeah, you could say
we've gotta take his body

01:19:20.611 --> 01:19:23.320
and bury it in the tar pits.

01:19:23.322 --> 01:19:24.153
What?

01:19:24.155 --> 01:19:29.090
(CHUCKLES) Just a
Wally internet gag thing.

01:19:29.092 --> 01:19:30.347
Yeah, he's just joking around.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.081
We'll leave you guys alone.

01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:34.879
We'll be out here waiting.

01:19:34.881 --> 01:19:35.964
I gotta go.

01:19:38.967 --> 01:19:41.550
I hope we see each other again.

01:19:45.486 --> 01:19:47.069
Dude, the tar pits.

01:19:48.631 --> 01:19:49.815
I know, right?

01:19:49.817 --> 01:19:51.940
It was in front of our
face the whole time, man.

01:19:51.942 --> 01:19:54.728
There's dinosaurs in there,
wooly mammoths and shit.

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:56.158
Wally will fit right in.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.703
Yes, let's get this over with now.

01:19:58.705 --> 01:20:00.305
That's what I'm saying.

01:20:00.307 --> 01:20:02.057
Get what over with?

01:20:04.315 --> 01:20:06.482
(KISSING)

01:20:11.034 --> 01:20:13.034
Uh, excuse us, please.

01:20:13.898 --> 01:20:14.731
Pardon?

01:20:15.748 --> 01:20:19.632
You think you could give
us a minute alone, please?

01:20:19.634 --> 01:20:23.051
Yeah, I left my gum in the car anyways.

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:29.481
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:29.483 --> 01:20:30.634
What? We were vibing.

01:20:30.636 --> 01:20:31.975
I texted her to meet us here.

01:20:31.977 --> 01:20:34.203
She's hot, right?

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:35.749
She smells like pickles.

01:20:35.751 --> 01:20:39.174
Jerry, we haven't even
disposed of the dead body, man

01:20:39.176 --> 01:20:41.273
and those guys are still chasing after us.

01:20:41.275 --> 01:20:42.711
Well hold on there, okay.

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:45.832
We lost them like miles ago
and to put your mind at ease,

01:20:45.834 --> 01:20:47.444
here check this out.

01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:49.205
MITCH: What are you doing?

01:20:49.207 --> 01:20:52.147
I'm looking for Jerry's wallet.

01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:54.649
Instead I found Wally's phone.

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:58.235
Dude, these are the guys
that have been chasing us

01:20:58.237 --> 01:20:59.070
all night.

01:21:02.312 --> 01:21:04.051
OFFICER: Hey, hey.

01:21:04.053 --> 01:21:06.551
Holy shit, these guys are cops.

01:21:06.553 --> 01:21:08.080
Dirty cops.

01:21:08.082 --> 01:21:12.148
Wally must have videotaped before he died.

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:14.152
That's why those guys are following us.

01:21:14.154 --> 01:21:15.181
MITCH: Oh shit.

01:21:15.183 --> 01:21:17.032
Dude, this video's private.

01:21:17.034 --> 01:21:18.030
Here, check this out.

01:21:18.032 --> 01:21:20.199
Douche bags meet internet.

01:21:21.475 --> 01:21:24.111
Whoa, what's that gonna do?

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:26.265
In like 10 minutes the
whole world's gonna know

01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:28.504
about this video and see it.

01:21:28.506 --> 01:21:30.191
Then these ass bags
are gonna be on the run

01:21:30.193 --> 01:21:31.875
the whole rest of their lives.

01:21:31.877 --> 01:21:32.738
Who?

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.570
The dirty fuckin' cops
who have been following us

01:21:34.572 --> 01:21:36.172
around town, dude.

01:21:36.174 --> 01:21:37.007
Huh.

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:39.770
Oh, f....

01:21:41.392 --> 01:21:44.916
I mean the clean cops who have
no history of malfeasance.

01:21:44.918 --> 01:21:47.168
(LAUGHING)

01:21:48.643 --> 01:21:50.839
You're a funny guy, huh?

01:21:50.841 --> 01:21:53.373
Get your asses moving now.

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.680
Bring that asshole Wally with ya.

01:21:55.682 --> 01:21:56.513
Let's go.

(SIRENS WAILING)

01:32:16.504 --> 01:32:18.332
Oh shit dude, let's get the keys.

01:32:18.334 --> 01:32:20.961
It's the po-pos man, let's get outta here.

01:32:20.963 --> 01:32:21.794
(SIRENS WAILING)

01:32:21.796 --> 01:32:22.629
No.

01:32:23.818 --> 01:32:25.000
What?

01:32:25.002 --> 01:32:27.931
No, no more running,
I'm gonna stay here.

01:32:27.933 --> 01:32:28.870
I'm gonna face this.

(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

01:33:09.393 --> 01:33:11.364
Man, you're right Charlie,
I never thanked you

01:33:11.366 --> 01:33:12.855
for all the stuff you'd done for me,

01:33:12.857 --> 01:33:14.016
especially when my mom died.

01:33:14.018 --> 01:33:17.768
So while I still have
the chance, thanks man.

01:33:22.124 --> 01:33:23.332
You're welcome.

01:33:23.334 --> 01:33:26.822
I'm gonna lawyer up,
I'm gonna beat this.

01:33:26.824 --> 01:33:28.768
I mean like you said this was an accident.

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.891
Baller move, Mitch.

01:33:30.893 --> 01:33:32.976
I'll be there to support.

01:33:34.445 --> 01:33:36.118
This is gonna suck, huh?

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.715
Yeah.

01:33:37.717 --> 01:33:40.511
You two boys are heroes.

01:33:40.513 --> 01:33:41.405
Wait, what?

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:43.215
You stabbed a serial killer to death

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.971
and brought down two dirty cops.

01:33:44.973 --> 01:33:46.478
You're free to go.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.620
Okay, please rewind.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:49.055
Serial killer?

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:51.875
Wally was the Census Killer.

01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:54.027
What the fuck?

01:33:54.029 --> 01:33:55.650
That is amazing.

01:33:55.652 --> 01:33:56.775
Turn around.

01:33:56.777 --> 01:33:59.796
You sure you don't wanna
leave these handcuffs on me?

01:33:59.798 --> 01:34:02.083
Only if you misbehave.

01:34:02.085 --> 01:34:02.916
This is getting awkward.

01:34:02.918 --> 01:34:04.918
I'm gonna step away now.

01:34:08.784 --> 01:34:11.117
Sir, sir you dropped this.

01:34:12.970 --> 01:34:14.572
Jessica's number?

01:34:14.574 --> 01:34:18.397
Oh yeah, I don't need this anymore.

01:34:18.399 --> 01:34:20.149
Give her a ring, man.

01:34:24.533 --> 01:34:25.913
It's not what it looks like.

01:34:25.915 --> 01:34:27.495
Oh really?

01:34:27.497 --> 01:34:30.664
No, it's exactly what it looks like.

01:34:35.278 --> 01:34:37.941
I'm gonna haunt you
'til the sun comes up.

01:34:37.943 --> 01:34:39.026
I dare you.

01:34:51.337 --> 01:34:53.987
We're here with Jerry Saltzman,
a part-time entrepreneur

01:34:53.989 --> 01:34:57.605
turned major player all thanks
to a multimillion dollar

01:34:57.607 --> 01:35:00.440
military contract and patent sale.

01:35:01.423 --> 01:35:04.673
You're gonna love my jam in your mouth.

01:35:06.519 --> 01:35:08.423
Tell me about Jerry's Jelly.

01:35:08.425 --> 01:35:12.879
Well when I first started
crafting Jerry's Jelly

01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:16.823
I wanted to create a
delicious line of savory jams

01:35:16.825 --> 01:35:18.174
and jellies.

01:35:18.176 --> 01:35:20.143
I never intended to
create a military-grade

01:35:20.145 --> 01:35:23.024
quality line, but that's
life, Hailey (CHUCKLES).

01:35:23.026 --> 01:35:26.395
Jerry's Jelly comes from
an old family recipe

01:35:26.397 --> 01:35:29.106
that has many medicinal properties, ha.

01:35:29.108 --> 01:35:33.422
Military experts claim
it's 2.5 times more powerful

01:35:33.424 --> 01:35:36.430
than the leading coagulant
which can mean the difference

01:35:36.432 --> 01:35:39.976
between life and death on the battlefield.

01:35:39.978 --> 01:35:44.784
Oh and the best part is
it's still quite tasty.

01:35:44.786 --> 01:35:45.953
Fascinating.

01:35:49.175 --> 01:35:50.448
(LAUGHING) What?

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:55.209
It's unbelievable, I
literally don't believe this.

01:35:55.211 --> 01:35:57.379
Look at our boy.

01:35:57.381 --> 01:36:00.173
He's like the Steve Jobs of jelly.

01:36:00.175 --> 01:36:01.352
He really is.

01:36:01.354 --> 01:36:03.043

01:36:11.144 --> 01:36:12.455
Why haven't you called?

01:36:12.457 --> 01:36:16.185
Do you have any idea how many
times I tried calling you?

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:17.520
I saw you on TV.

01:36:19.144 --> 01:36:20.559
