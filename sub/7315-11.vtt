WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:06.205
Boy: Thought you were
making him a christmas cake.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.340
Well, who says christmas
can't be patriotic?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.509
Besides, they were
all out of green... Hey!

00:10.511 --> 00:12.044
Is that a clean shirt?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.445
Clean enough.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.381
The man's flying
over 6,000 miles to be home

00:15.383 --> 00:18.484
I think we can do better
than "clean enough."

00:18.486 --> 00:20.119
Ho, ho, ho!

00:20.121 --> 00:22.221
Hello?
Oh, my god.
(chuckles)

00:22.223 --> 00:24.089
Dad?

00:24.091 --> 00:25.557
(chuckles)
there's my big man.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.259
You're early.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.727
You complaining?
No.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.596
Mom made
all your favorites, dad.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.098
She made you a meatloaf
and some mashed potatoes

00:33.100 --> 00:35.401
And a weird
christmas cake and...
And your kid sister.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.270
Where's emma?
Oh, that sweet baby wanted to
wait up for her daddy so bad,

00:38.272 --> 00:41.673
But she had to come home
from school with a low fever.
Oh, poor peanut.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.043
Let me see that kid.
Aw.
(chuckles)

00:44.045 --> 00:46.111
Okay, help me get supper
on the table.
Okay.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.815
Hi, honey.

00:52.685 --> 00:55.754
It's daddy.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.591
Damn.

00:59.593 --> 01:02.261
How low was
that fever, babe?

01:02.263 --> 01:06.632
It was... Less than 100
about an hour ago.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.634
Oh, my god.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.335
She's burning up.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.205
Emma, kid, hey, wake up.

01:13.207 --> 01:14.673
Daddy's home.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.509
She's barely breathing.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.244
Emma? Emma?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.846
Call 911. Emma.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.281
Please, baby, breathe.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.549
Emma!

01:54.881 --> 01:57.349
Christmas in jamaica.
Nice.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.384
Nice?
(imitates accent): No, mon.

01:59.386 --> 02:02.154
After the year I've had,
a little sun, sand

02:02.156 --> 02:03.755
And sipping cold comfort
from a coconut

02:03.757 --> 02:05.691
Is gonna be spectacular.

02:05.693 --> 02:08.260
Though not terribly
christmassy.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.129
I'll pack some mistletoe.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.530
How you gonna
spend yours?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.866
With my family in oklahoma.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.868
My mom cooking,

02:15.870 --> 02:18.303
My husband and brothers
arguing football,

02:18.305 --> 02:19.571
Snowshoe hikes with my dad.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.772
It's gonna be so...

02:20.774 --> 02:22.741
Terribly christmassy.
Yes.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.343
(both chuckle)

02:24.345 --> 02:26.545
Bishop:
Wow.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.180
Look at you, abby.

02:28.182 --> 02:31.183
So festive.
Well, it is, after all, the most

02:31.185 --> 02:32.651
Wonderful time of the year.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.719
Thank you.
Time.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.320
Wonderful time.
So what do

02:35.322 --> 02:37.856
We have here? An engraved rolex?
No.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.791
They're my wonderful lab-baked
holiday cookies.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.661
Ginger spice chip.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.396
Did you say "lab-baked"?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.766
Yes. I wield a very
merry bunsen burner.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.168
Mmm...

02:49.170 --> 02:50.569
Why the long face
on mcgee?

02:50.571 --> 02:52.571
Dial-a-fruitcake mess up
his order again?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.306
Abby: I don't know.
Something's wrong.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.841
He gave me the finger
when I came in.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.510
The-the "one-minute" finger,
not the bad one.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.612
It might be delilah.
Mmm.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.680
(mcgee hangs up phone)

03:03.349 --> 03:04.883
Trouble in paradise,
tiny tim?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.885
Well, not for us.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.354
A friend of ours, the dalys.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.757
Kevin gets home from afghanistan
last night and the first thing

03:11.759 --> 03:14.293
He and audrey have to do is rush
their five-year-old daughter

03:14.295 --> 03:15.327
To the er.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.262
Why? What happened?

03:17.264 --> 03:20.199
They don't know.
Out of the blue, it's just...

03:20.201 --> 03:22.634
Fever spiked,
windpipe swelled shut.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.236
She's in the icu now.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.271
That is so weird.
Weird

03:26.273 --> 03:28.340
And horrible.
Yeah. No, but, I mean,

03:28.342 --> 03:31.310
I-I have a marine friend going
through the exact same thing.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.878
Her perfectly
healthy son,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.580
Suddenly struck down
and on a respirator.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.747
Just yesterday.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.849
That is weird.
Yeah.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.452
What's worse than two sick kids
during the holidays?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.654
Eight sick kids.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.790
Carol.
(chuckles)

03:44.792 --> 03:46.758
Wow, what are you doing here?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.961
I wish it was
a social call, abby.

03:48.963 --> 03:51.863
Oh... It's never good
when you say that.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.598
Mm-mm.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.699
Um, bishop,

03:53.701 --> 03:55.734
This is carol.
Um, she works at

03:55.736 --> 03:58.303
The naval medical
research center now

03:58.305 --> 03:59.671
And she's my
oldest friend.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.340
I prefer "long-time" friend.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.341
Mcgee:
Boss, did you say

04:02.343 --> 04:03.609
Eight sick kids?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.810
All with the same
mystery illness,

04:04.812 --> 04:06.545
All within 30 miles of dc.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.746
Start of an epidemic?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.748
Or worse-- all are
from military families,

04:09.750 --> 04:10.882
Living in military housing.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.985
No. No.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.319
Nobody say it.
Bioterror.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.722
Abby can say it
but nobody else.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.757
Uh, I-I just read a study
last month

04:18.759 --> 04:20.859
That weighed this possibility.
I mean, what better way

04:20.861 --> 04:22.661
To terrorize military personnel
than through their kids?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.029
Tony: There's nothing
"better" about it.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.932
I know enough about bioterror
as it is, thank you.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.934
Carol:
All we need to know in
this case is what it is,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.870
Where it started
and how to stop it.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.405
You said "we."

04:33.407 --> 04:35.574
Gibbs:
It's not our usual case,
but it is navy and

04:35.576 --> 04:36.842
Marine corps families.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.777
They want us in
on the investigation.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.713
Carol:
While I work the
scientific end with abby.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.048
We're coordinating with the cdc.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.285
My office is sending
all our data here.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.719
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

04:47.721 --> 04:48.820
Gibbs:
All right,

04:48.822 --> 04:50.355
Split up. Hit the hospitals,

04:50.357 --> 04:51.890
Interview the parents,
talk to the kids,

04:51.892 --> 04:54.693
Retrace their steps. Let's go.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.864
Absolutely, gibbs,
whatever manpower we can spare.

04:58.866 --> 05:03.001
Yeah, well, let's find out
what's making these kids...

05:03.003 --> 05:05.871
Let's do what we can.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.307
These kids what?

05:09.842 --> 05:11.376
You said,
"what's making these kids..."

05:11.378 --> 05:13.011
And then stopped.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.813
Daddy doesn't bring work home
anymore, jared.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.714
You know that.

05:15.716 --> 05:16.915
Jared:
So?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.083
He can tell me in the car.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.420
How have you guys
been feeling lately?

05:21.422 --> 05:23.088
What? Like, health-wise?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.323
Mm-hmm.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.024
We're fine.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.026
No coughs? No headaches?

05:28.028 --> 05:30.095
No. All good here. Why?

05:30.097 --> 05:33.432
Let's go to school.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.436
Is that jared

05:37.438 --> 05:39.438
And kayla?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.408
Kids, go wait
in the car.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.409
(alarm beeps)

05:44.411 --> 05:46.378
Man:
And you would be...

05:46.380 --> 05:48.046
Leon vance?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.118
Lamar addison.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.121
I know who you are.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.790
What I don't know is
how you found my home.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.094
You're not the only one
with resources, director.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.829
You have no business
coming here.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.397
Oh, but I do.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.399
And there's no need
for that confrontational tone.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.735
I'm certainly not looking
for trouble.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.471
Then I suggest you go back to
new york, before it finds you.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.473
I only want to say hello.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.775
Well, then, hello.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.378
And good-bye.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.091
Who was that guy, dad?

06:33.093 --> 06:36.027
Nobody, jared.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.430
He's nobody.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.478
Kevin:
Worst part's not being able
to do anything to help her.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.581
All anyone can tell us is
that emma's now one of 14 kids

06:56.583 --> 06:58.150
Going through
the same thing.
14?

06:58.152 --> 07:00.585
And not one of them
is responding to treatment.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.854
Doctors still have no idea
what they're dealing with here.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.490
Bishop: Mcgee.
Well, don't worry, kev.
They will.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.661
Give me one second.
I'll be right back.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.565
(quietly):
Did you know the number's
up to 14 kids?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.567
(quietly):
Did you know that rate of
reproduction puts it on par

07:15.569 --> 07:17.836
With the sars virus?
You think it's sars?

07:17.838 --> 07:20.439
I don't think anything-- I mean,
sars has never been contracted

07:20.441 --> 07:24.443
A better chance of a targeted
chemical attack than that.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.144
A chemical attack?

07:26.146 --> 07:28.580
Uh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to...

07:28.582 --> 07:30.182
Pure speculation, audrey.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.683
Yeah, and not
all that likely.

07:31.685 --> 07:35.720
Comparing it
to the sars virus.
Oh, my god,

07:35.722 --> 07:37.556
I-it's sars?
Bishop: No, no...
(sighs)

07:37.558 --> 07:39.024
No, no, no, no. I was only...
Could you maybe
do your comparing

07:39.026 --> 07:40.158
Somewhere else, please?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.160
Yeah. Sorry, guys.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.162
(whispers):
Come on.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.697
(phone ringing)

07:45.699 --> 07:48.467
Guess you're gonna have
to work on that stage whisper.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.168
Like I don't
feel bad enough?

07:50.170 --> 07:53.638
Tony, hey.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.640
Uh, pretty awful.
How 'bout you?

07:55.642 --> 07:58.510
No, bishop, let it go.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.247
Wait, what?

08:02.249 --> 08:05.083
Tony: ...19 sick kids.
19? We just heard 14.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.585
Tony: ...Five more cases
over here in the last hour.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.520
There's five more cases
at washington general

08:08.522 --> 08:09.788
In the last hour.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.223
Does tony have their locations?
I'm putting

08:11.225 --> 08:13.191
Together a map.
Tony, send bishop

08:13.193 --> 08:15.193
Their locations.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.696
Tony: We gotta stop this.
Yeah, I know.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.966
What the hell is this thing?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.268
Ducky: The last infectious
disease I recall

08:23.270 --> 08:27.005
That primarily
affected children was...

08:27.007 --> 08:29.541
Poliomyelitis, which, of course,

08:29.543 --> 08:32.143
Was eradicated
in this country decades ago.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.546
You know, while it was
mostly children, dr. Mallard,

08:34.548 --> 08:36.548
Polio afflicts more adults
than people think.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.651
Most recently during a pretty
nasty outbreak in namibia,

08:39.653 --> 08:40.752
2006.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.555
Really? Namibia.
Interesting.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.156
I took a few
epidemiology classes

08:45.158 --> 08:47.759
After agent dinozzo's
y. Pestis scare years ago.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.760
Ah.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.061
Yeah, we studied
quite a few maps

08:50.063 --> 08:51.263
Looked just
like this one.

08:51.265 --> 08:55.600
Well, the pattern
is reminiscent of the...

08:55.602 --> 08:58.203
Cholera outbreak of 1961

08:58.205 --> 08:59.871
Which devastated
indonesia.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.774
That, or the early stages
of montreal's smallpox epidemic

09:02.776 --> 09:04.276
Of 1885.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.611
That one left
over 3,000 dead.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.247
Abby to gibbs. Come in, gibbs.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.649
Abby to gi... Oh, hey, guys.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.317
Did I hit my ducky button
by accident?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.719
Hey, abbs. What do you got?
Abby: Oh, there you are.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.656
You would not believe
the mountains of medical data

09:17.658 --> 09:19.257
That the nmrc sent over.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.326
Carol and I could be days
combing through it.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.695
Give me an early guess.
Too early, gibbs.

09:23.697 --> 09:27.198
Abby:
I mean, it's obviously
respiratory, bronchial.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.001
Hopefully it's bacterial,
not viral.
Ms. Sciuto,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.770
Would an extra pair of hands
be useful

09:31.772 --> 09:33.171
With all this data?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.339
Abby:
Well, always, ducky.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.041
You offering?

09:36.043 --> 09:40.045
Not me. But mr. Palmer has
become an expert in the field.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.614
(chuckles)
I-I don't know about expert,
but, uh...

09:42.616 --> 09:46.051
Come on down, jimmy.
Let's kick some epidemic butt.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.019
You sure, dr. Mallard?
You wouldn't mind?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.689
Why would I mind
my own idea?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.691
You.
Don't look at me, palmer. Go.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.858
You can count on us, gibbs.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.660
Cabby out.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.162
Ducky:
Hmm...

09:57.164 --> 09:58.363
Namibia.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.365
Vance:
More kids, more military bases.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.268
It's hard to look at this
and not think bioterror, gibbs.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.704
Pursuing every angle, yeah.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.773
Well, keep the updates coming.
Secnav wants in the loop.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.743
Yeah. Yeah. Figured.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.879
You all right?

10:17.683 --> 10:18.750
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.751
You sure?

10:22.054 --> 10:23.121
Kids?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.756
Mmm. Yeah.
(knocks on desk)

10:30.296 --> 10:32.130
I had a visitor.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.799
So did jackie's brother michael,
in prison the other day.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.800
Who?

10:35.802 --> 10:38.870
Lamar addison.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.239
Owns a chain of car dealerships
up in new york.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.874
Michael said he had a lot
of questions about jackie,

10:42.876 --> 10:44.275
About the kids.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.777
Well, who is he to jackie?

10:45.779 --> 10:47.679
Her father.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.181
Jackie
and michael's both.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.417
He walked out when they
were kids and never came back.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.986
Talking to jackie, I always got
the impression he was dead.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.323
Only to us.
Anything I can do?

10:58.325 --> 11:00.692
It's a personal matter, gibbs.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.428
Okay. Anything I can do?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.964
Thanks... Gibbs,

11:05.966 --> 11:08.099
But I got this.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.978
Wow.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.414
These kids are
really sick.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.015
Well, not for long, jimmy,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.717
'cause we're gonna
lick this thing.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.986
I mean, not...
Not literally lick it.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.788
That's just gross.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.723
(knocking)
excuse me, abby?

11:31.725 --> 11:34.359
Breena, so good
to see you!

11:34.361 --> 11:36.761
Um, this is carol.
Pleasure.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.397
Hi. I'm sorry to bother
you at work, jimmy,

11:39.399 --> 11:41.733
But ducky said you'd be here.
Oh, it's fine.
Is everything okay?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.703
Yeah. Great, actually.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.738
The agency may have
found us a birth mother.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.773
What?! Really?!
They want to meet
with us soon.

11:48.775 --> 11:52.077
Like day after tomorrow.
(laughing)
a baby!

11:52.079 --> 11:53.778
That's-that's great!

11:53.780 --> 11:55.146
It's-it's-it's...
It's amazing.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.481
Um, let's not
celebrate, okay?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.717
Not yet. Not yet.
We still have so much work

11:58.719 --> 12:00.051
To do here.
Um, breena, just

12:00.053 --> 12:01.820
Find out what time
they want to meet,

12:01.822 --> 12:04.089
And, um, we will be
there... With bells on.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.790
Christmas bells?

12:05.792 --> 12:07.792
You bet, you bet.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.728
I'll call you later... Daddy.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.430
Okay. Okay.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.300
Wow. Um... Okay.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.836
I'm so happy
for both of you!
Yeah.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.171
I'm really happy, too,

12:20.173 --> 12:23.174
But I'll be a lot happier
when one of us can figure out

12:23.176 --> 12:25.210
What that is.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.216
Never seen anything like it.

12:32.184 --> 12:34.152
Abby:
We have a lot

12:34.154 --> 12:38.156
Of work ahead of us.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.258
Wait, back up.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.227
You really had the plague?

12:42.229 --> 12:44.262
Like, the actual plague, plague?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.097
Pneumonic plague.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.532
We were on a
first-name basis.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.201
And here I thought that you
were just being paranoid.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.836
One too many cheesy
outbreak movies.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.072
Oh, no. It's the real deal.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.240
Wow.
Of course,
I could site,

12:55.242 --> 12:56.775
You know, <i>contagion</i>

12:56.777 --> 12:58.343
Or <i>28 days later</i>
<i>as major influences.</i>

12:58.345 --> 13:00.245
Isn't that last one
a zombie flick?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.080
Oh, come on.
Like there's a difference?

13:02.082 --> 13:03.348
Gibbs:
The difference,
dinozzo,

13:03.350 --> 13:05.917
Is that nobody's
been eaten... Yet.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.852
Let's go.

13:07.854 --> 13:11.356
Number is up
to 23 afflicted kids, boss.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.124
Bishop, are you
joining us?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.193
Oh, actually,
I'm chasing a lead here.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.295
Abby's a genius
with ginger, by the way.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.963
My mom made me
a batch like these

13:18.965 --> 13:20.298
For my first-grade graduation.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.232
These are right up there.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.202
Your lead good enough to share?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.272
What? Uh, no.
Uh, not yet. Um...

13:27.274 --> 13:28.540
Very soon.
Do-do you want... Are you sure

13:28.542 --> 13:30.208
You don't want any?
I don't like ginger.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.510
Okay.
Tony:
Not in your cookies, anyway.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.945
You're a cinnamon man.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.880
Like the cinnamon girl.

13:35.882 --> 13:38.383
Neil young,
and it's just an analogy.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.951
Sort of a redheaded
metaphor. What...?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.920
Mcgee was saying something
important. What was it?

13:41.922 --> 13:45.957
23 kids, and other than
being from military families,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.859
There's just not much
common ground.

13:47.861 --> 13:50.361
Tony:
Only nine kids crossed
paths at these four schools.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.863
We're still tracking
extracurricular activities--

13:51.865 --> 13:53.198
Play dates, sports teams.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.833
(bishop gasps loudly)

13:54.835 --> 13:56.067
What?

13:56.069 --> 13:57.368
What? Uh... Oh, nothing.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.570
Just getting closer.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.104
Close enough. Spit it out.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.940
Uh, not until I verify
a connection.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.041
Spit, bishop.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.876
(sighs)
okay.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.244
Well, I was checking
the government watch list,

14:06.246 --> 14:08.246
And came across a recent
addition named max comey.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.881
On it.
Recently fired
from labsynthe,

14:09.883 --> 14:11.883
A chemical
research facility in burke.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.385
He was accused of taking
a variety of toxic mold spores

14:14.387 --> 14:15.920
He was supposed to dispose of.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.856
Taking it to do what?
It doesn't say.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.157
I mean,
while not exactly a crime,

14:19.159 --> 14:20.625
It was grounds enough
for a dismissal

14:20.627 --> 14:22.360
And his placement
on the government watch list.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.863
All right,
I got him.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.265
Current address is
on harwood place in pax river.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.267
Tony:
Wait a second. Harwood place.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.435
It's the same street
as one of these schools.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.370
Coincidence?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.239
Mcgee:
I don't think so.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.007
Comey was also red-flagged
last week

14:36.009 --> 14:37.475
For fighting
with a marine corps recruiter

14:37.477 --> 14:40.011
After he was refused
an application.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.613
Yeah, because he was
on the watch list.

14:41.615 --> 14:44.249
It's motive. Mcgee,
keep working it from here.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.051
Dinozzo, bishop, come on,
let's go. You're with me.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.520
Oh.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.193
Leaves his front
door open.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.427
Remind you of anyone?

14:58.964 --> 15:01.032
Ncis!

15:07.640 --> 15:10.108
Closet's empty.
Drawers, too.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.976
Moved out in a hurry.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.145
Where would I keep
toxic mold spores

15:14.147 --> 15:16.114
At my house?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.548
Hmm?

15:17.550 --> 15:21.319
Ew. Some pretty toxic leftovers.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.922
I got something here.

15:28.127 --> 15:31.396
Tony:
So, whatever comey stole
from the lab, he either

15:31.398 --> 15:33.331
Used or took with him?

15:35.067 --> 15:39.604
(phone ringing)

15:41.540 --> 15:43.541
Yeah, duck.

15:43.543 --> 15:47.979
I'm afraid our mystery illness
has claimed its first fatality.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.014
It's not one of the kids.
Ducky:
No.

15:50.016 --> 15:53.651
But it may just be
a matter of time.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.287
When it comes
to infectious diseases,

15:56.289 --> 15:59.190
The old are just as vulnerable
as the young.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.459
I'm afraid
things may be getting worse

16:01.461 --> 16:04.028
Before they get better.

16:12.304 --> 16:15.039
Mcgee:
Victim is lloyd grunfeld, 71,

16:15.041 --> 16:17.175
Recently widowed,
vietnam vet.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.676
The last 31 years,

16:18.678 --> 16:22.180
He's managed an on-base
dry cleaning shop at quantico.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.282
District hospital says
he checked in last night

16:24.284 --> 16:26.517
With the same symptoms
as our 23 afflicted children.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.086
Twenty-eight.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.587
(sighs)

16:29.589 --> 16:32.323
Uh, sky-high fever,
respiratory distress, but

16:32.325 --> 16:33.658
Before they could
get him to a bed,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.093
He collapsed and died
on the er floor.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.494
(tony hangs up phone)

16:36.496 --> 16:38.029
All right, we've got his home
quarantined

16:38.031 --> 16:39.364
Until we know what killed him.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.200
What about the bolo on comey?
No hits yet.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.634
The landlord said
he was close to eviction, but

16:43.636 --> 16:44.736
Moved out on his own.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.270
We spoke to some

16:46.272 --> 16:48.206
Of his former co-workers
at the research lab.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.142
Sounds like dr. Max
was a pretty odd guy.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.744
Doctor?
Tony:
Doctor, doctor.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.445
That's what
he called himself.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.248
Took his job as a lab assistant
a little too seriously.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.050
Boastful,
self-important.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.451
Especially around
the ladies,

17:00.453 --> 17:02.420
Who considered him more
annoying than dangerous.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.756
That is, until the mold spores
went bye-bye.

17:04.758 --> 17:06.758
How toxic are these things?

17:06.760 --> 17:08.760
Well, not
exactly anthrax,

17:08.762 --> 17:10.595
But they could certainly
make a person sick

17:10.597 --> 17:13.498
If ingested or
inhaled over time.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.201
It's got to be connected.
Mcgee: Well, we've
requisitioned surveillance

17:17.203 --> 17:18.436
On grunfeld
and some of the kids.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.771
See if they crossed paths.

17:19.773 --> 17:22.040
(phone ringing)
yeah, duck.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.809
Ducky: Jethro,
can you come down?
Yeah. Be right down.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.081
That's it?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.382
No "nice job,"

17:31.384 --> 17:32.717
Or "good idea, guys"?

17:33.485 --> 17:35.353
No?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.655
It's a nice jacket.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.657
Okay.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.260
Hate to admit it,
dr. Mallard,

17:42.262 --> 17:45.229
But I was pretty relieved when
you called me in to assist.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.098
All those infection
cases in abby's lab.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.366
Those poor kids.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.068
It's pretty
overwhelming.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.805
Elderly and deceased is
a far easier concept to confront

17:53.807 --> 17:56.207
Than young and suffering.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.409
And now, with this adoption
becoming a real possibility,

17:58.411 --> 17:59.844
It's got me wondering
if I'm even ready.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.212
Ready?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.647
Jimmy:
To be a father.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.615
Consigned
to a lifetime of worry.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.684
There are so many things
that can go wrong.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.386
Well, that may be true,

18:08.388 --> 18:11.255
But with the rewards
far outweighing the risks,

18:11.257 --> 18:13.091
I'm sure you're up to the task.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.659
I'm glad one of us is sure.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.394
(knocking on glass)
agent gibbs.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.495
Hey, duck!

18:17.497 --> 18:19.230
What's the word?

18:19.232 --> 18:22.533
Retired first lieutenant
grunfeld's misfortune

18:22.535 --> 18:25.670
May well be the savior
to many children.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.106
What's the cause of death?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.807
An extremely aggressive strain
of pneumonia.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.310
Yeah, his trachea and lungs
were besieged by it.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.178
Treatable?

18:34.180 --> 18:38.783
Not to a man of his advanced
years and diabetic condition.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.119
But, uh, previously
healthy children,

18:41.121 --> 18:43.154
Yes, it should be
quite treatable.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.388
Really, doctor?

18:44.390 --> 18:46.491
That's-that's wonderful!

18:46.493 --> 18:48.126
Gibbs:
Hey, palmer?

18:48.128 --> 18:50.361
Things do go right sometimes.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.563
Oh, you-you heard that earlier?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.865
Yeah.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.868
That is, provided
that abby and carol

18:56.870 --> 18:59.637
Can identify the specific strain
of pneumonia

18:59.639 --> 19:01.572
From those cultures.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.574
I will get these up to them
right away.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.377
Yeah. Good.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.146
(knocking on door)

19:08.148 --> 19:10.548
Come in.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.587
I appreciate
the invitation,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.789
But you didn't have
to send your henchmen.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.525
Those henchmen
are federal agents.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.827
Sent after a phone call
from my children's nanny

19:22.829 --> 19:24.929
Concerned about a man
stalking my home.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.399
A knock on a door
is hardly stalking, leon.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.401
My compliments,
by the way.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.804
That nanny--
she's a very charming woman.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.540
And that's
important.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.841
It's good to move on.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.943
Move on?
Did you just say "move on"?

19:40.879 --> 19:43.581
You mean, like you moved on from
your wife and kids, addison?

19:43.583 --> 19:45.850
Is that what you mean?
Millie and I were never married.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.752
So it's all good then?

19:47.754 --> 19:50.922
You making judgments about
things you know nothing about?

19:50.924 --> 19:53.624
Do you realize the mess
that you left behind, addison?

19:53.626 --> 19:54.959
The mess that jackie and I were
left to clean up

19:54.961 --> 19:56.494
Where your son is concerned?

19:56.496 --> 19:58.896
Considering
I found michael in prison,

19:58.898 --> 20:00.631
You did a real fine job.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.936
And here all this time,
I thought

20:04.938 --> 20:07.505
Jackie was exaggerating
when it came to you.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.840
No. That was me.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.876
Regretfully.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.879
Somehow digging all this up
has me reverting back

20:14.881 --> 20:16.847
To some old, bad habits.

20:16.849 --> 20:17.949
And you had quite a few of 'em.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.484
Had. <i>Had,</i> leon.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.620
I had a few.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.922
But people change.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.958
And my only hope now is

20:26.960 --> 20:28.893
To make up for lost time
and show my grandkids

20:28.895 --> 20:31.662
I'm not the villain
they may have heard about.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.598
There's no need.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.766
Jackie was too good
to speak ill of you.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.669
Never spoke of you
at all, in fact.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.871
As far as my children
are concerned,

20:40.873 --> 20:43.007
Their mother's father
is long dead.

20:43.009 --> 20:46.711
Out of respect to jackie,
I intend to keep it that way.

20:46.713 --> 20:50.615
I suppose all I can ask is,
any way I can change your mind?

20:52.017 --> 20:53.851
I could pay
for their college tuition

20:53.853 --> 20:55.419
If you would reconsider.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.255
My children are not for sale.

21:02.794 --> 21:04.929
Agent kurtwell, would you
kindly escort mr. Addison

21:04.931 --> 21:06.530
To his car, please?

21:06.532 --> 21:09.567
Leon... That's not what I meant.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.502
You darken my door again,
old man,

21:11.504 --> 21:13.671
My agents will not be
bringing you here,

21:13.673 --> 21:15.673
I can promise you that.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.847
(sighs)

21:25.284 --> 21:26.484
(door shuts)

21:28.687 --> 21:30.655
(sighs)

21:30.657 --> 21:32.857
Abby:
Gibbs!
Got news for me, abbs?

21:32.859 --> 21:34.992
Yup. Looks like
old man grunfeld died of

21:34.994 --> 21:36.661
<i>Streptococcus</i>
<i>pneumoniae.</i>

21:36.663 --> 21:38.696
Carol:
Didn't look like
strep before,

21:38.698 --> 21:41.032
But the cultures
came back positive.
And it's the same bacterium

21:41.034 --> 21:43.701
That's been infecting the kids?
So, what now?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.636
Just called the hospitals,

21:45.638 --> 21:47.305
And they're administering the
correct antibiotics as we speak.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.307
Should just be
a matter of time,

21:49.309 --> 21:51.042
And the kids will be
right as rain.

21:51.044 --> 21:53.911
Here's to healthy kids,
and jimmy being a daddy!

21:53.913 --> 21:55.513
Whoa, whoa, but,

21:55.515 --> 21:57.848
Uh, that's still just
potentially, abby.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.917
Don't want to get
ahead of ourselves.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.320
For once, I'm with palmer.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.388
Wait. You are?

22:07.025 --> 22:09.960
Bishop: Looks like grunfeld
hardly ever left his store.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.663
He did handle an awful
lot of dirty clothes.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.432
Nothing compared to this kid.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.867
Patient number 18,
josh baker.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.402
Kid's a walking petri dish.

22:18.404 --> 22:20.004
Same with little emma daly here.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.772
It's nothing short of a miracle

22:21.774 --> 22:23.708
These kids don't get sick
more often.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.943
Okay, what are we looking at?
Surveillance
and home videos

22:25.945 --> 22:27.678
Of grunfeld
and some of the kids.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.014
Looking to see where
they may have crossed paths,

22:30.016 --> 22:30.981
Or picked up whatever
they picked up.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.717
They seem to pick up everything.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.019
It's strep pneumonia.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.054
Wait. What?
What they picked up.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.723
Abby thinks it's
strep pneumonia.

22:38.725 --> 22:39.990
The hospitals are already
treating the kids.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.659
Tony:
Strep pneumonia?

22:41.661 --> 22:42.927
That's it?

22:42.929 --> 22:44.128
It, as in cured?

22:44.130 --> 22:45.730
Oh, my god, that's great!

22:45.732 --> 22:47.098
Gibbs:
No, it's good.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.666
Great'll be
when we find patient zero

22:48.668 --> 22:49.967
And shut down the source.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.035
Tony:
Right.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.103
Okay, mr. Scrooge.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.071
(tony chuckles)

22:54.073 --> 22:57.074
Not that you're stingy
or cheap in any way.

22:57.076 --> 22:59.744
I was just...
Because of the... Christmas.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.746
This is

23:01.748 --> 23:04.115
A relief.
Good job, everybody.

23:04.117 --> 23:05.683
Are you okay, mcgee?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.752
Yeah, yeah.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.820
I was just thinking
about little emma here,

23:09.822 --> 23:11.856
And the dalys--
they must be so happy.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.391
Yeah. Them and me both.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.093
I felt terrible about
scaring them the way I did.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.828
You still haven't
gotten over that?

23:17.830 --> 23:19.163
Well, like
they didn't have enough

23:19.165 --> 23:20.798
On their plates
without me suggesting

23:20.800 --> 23:23.033
A targeted chemical attack.

23:23.035 --> 23:26.103
I've done worse,
and mcgee...

23:26.105 --> 23:27.772
Well, he's... Remember
the time with the...?

23:27.774 --> 23:29.173
I'm not gonna talk about it,

23:29.175 --> 23:31.776
But it's... It's been done.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.944
You just have to move on.
You made a mistake.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.045
A big mistake.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.747
Learn from it, move on.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.483
I will, gibbs,
eventually.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.185
Soon... Bishop.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.953
For your own good.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.055
Tony:
Leroy ebenezer gibbs,

23:45.057 --> 23:46.657
Did we just agree on something?

23:46.659 --> 23:50.928
Hey, bob cratchit,
find patient zero, huh?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.630
And a playful
movie reference.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.131
It really is starting
to feel like christmas.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.834
Mcgee:
More like
christmas morning.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.136
Just got a hit on the bolo.
Max comey's been located.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.205
Let's go.
Hang on.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.973
You said this guy likes
the ladies, right?

24:08.079 --> 24:10.981
What?

24:16.221 --> 24:18.022
(sighs)

24:18.024 --> 24:19.089
Hey.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.091
Hey.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.093
Could you tell me about
this tree over here?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.496
Um, pretty sure it's green
like the rest of 'em.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.131
Yeah. (laughs)
yeah.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.133
It's, uh... It's this
one right over here.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.569
(bishop shivers)

24:31.571 --> 24:33.204
Hmm.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.773
Didn't you used to
work at labsynthe?

24:35.775 --> 24:38.175
I-I temped there
last month.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.478
You're dr. Max, right?

24:40.480 --> 24:41.812
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.013
That's right.
(laughs)

24:43.015 --> 24:44.148
Yeah, you were...

24:44.150 --> 24:45.983
You were one of
the smart ones.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.219
What are you... What are
you doing working here?

24:48.221 --> 24:49.487
Long story.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.522
They, uh, let me go.
What?

24:51.524 --> 24:54.859
Seriously?
They've got me
living out of my van.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.262
A guy like me, reduced
to selling trees.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.197
Can you believe that?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.800
No, I can't. That is...

25:02.802 --> 25:04.201
That's so unfair.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.170
I know, right?

25:06.172 --> 25:09.206
But, uh, they'll know they've
made a mistake soon enough.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.175
I'll show them.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.210
Them?

25:13.212 --> 25:15.012
Gibbs:
So, who's "them,"

25:15.014 --> 25:16.146
Max?

25:16.148 --> 25:18.115
Show them what exactly?

25:18.117 --> 25:20.117
Let's start with
the van, huh?

25:28.260 --> 25:31.161
Max:
I got nothing to hide.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.296
What do we have here?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.233
Nothing to hide, huh?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.668
That's not mine.

25:37.670 --> 25:40.638
I-I-I've never seen that
before in my life.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.608
Really.

25:48.079 --> 25:49.246
That-that...

25:49.248 --> 25:52.583
(grunts)

25:59.658 --> 26:03.060
I didn't steal anything.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.162
The lab was throwing
that stuff away.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.965
Perfectly good
toxic mold spores.

26:07.967 --> 26:12.636
Maybe I like to do
my own experiments.

26:12.638 --> 26:15.339
A guy doesn't have
to be, like, an actual doctor

26:15.341 --> 26:17.074
In order to save the world.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.208
Is that your plan?

26:18.210 --> 26:21.078
To save the world?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.613
But in order to do that,
you'd have

26:22.615 --> 26:24.148
To make
the whole world sick, right?

26:24.150 --> 26:27.685
Not the whole world, no.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.254
Gibbs:
Then who, max?

26:30.256 --> 26:33.257
The marines after
they rejected you?

26:36.027 --> 26:37.628
Maybe the kids.

26:38.964 --> 26:41.332
Not kids. Never.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.703
(sighs)

26:45.705 --> 26:48.072
Do you promise not
to tell her?

26:49.007 --> 26:50.641
We promise.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.176
Bernadette.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.144
My girlfriend.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.146
How do we find her?

26:56.148 --> 26:59.083
Well, she's the cashier
over at the megamart.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.718
You want to make her sick?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.987
It's stupid, I know, but

27:02.989 --> 27:06.090
I figured if I helped her
feel better again,

27:06.092 --> 27:08.292
She might appreciate me more.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.161
That's not stupid at all.

27:11.163 --> 27:17.134
Thing is, I'm still working
on the whole cure part.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.170
I didn't want
to get her sick without that.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.407
I'm not a monster, after all.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.109
Ducky:
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

27:25.111 --> 27:26.677
<i>This man is delusional</i>

27:26.679 --> 27:28.078
And potentially dangerous.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.780
Better go find this bernadette.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.048
If she exists, I doubt

27:31.050 --> 27:32.416
That she's aware
that he does.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.418
Their relationship,
I'm sure,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.320
Is entirely
in his mind.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.222
And the mold spores
he possesses,

27:38.224 --> 27:40.357
While they might make
someone quite sick,

27:40.359 --> 27:44.094
I'm not convinced they'd
turn into strep pneumonia.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.397
It's not strep pneumonia.

27:46.399 --> 27:47.865
What is it?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.166
Well, all the doctors agreed

27:49.168 --> 27:51.101
With our initial findings,

27:51.103 --> 27:53.170
But the kids aren't responding
to the antibiotics for strep.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.239
And it seems like the
bacterium is mutating

27:55.241 --> 27:56.874
Into something
else-- something

27:56.876 --> 28:01.178
Way, way, worse,
and I'm really, really bummed.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.780
That makes two of us.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.690
So we're back to not knowing?

28:12.692 --> 28:16.727
Right. You'll keep this comey
fellow in custody till we do?

28:16.729 --> 28:18.195
(doorbell chiming)

28:18.197 --> 28:20.264
I'll get it.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.770
All right, gibbs.
Keep me posted.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.218
Did you think
I was kidding?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.786
Are you really
calling my bluff?

28:42.788 --> 28:44.488
Please, leon.

28:44.490 --> 28:48.225
I have just one thing I want
to get off my chest before I go.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.427
Please.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.299
Two minutes.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.872
(sighs)

29:01.874 --> 29:07.377
Looking back, I had my reasons
for leaving jackie's mother--

29:07.379 --> 29:09.780
Reasons that made sense
to me at the time.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.315
You thought she was beneath you.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.183
Is that what jackie thought?

29:13.185 --> 29:17.221
No, it wasn't millie's
shortcomings, it was mine.

29:17.223 --> 29:21.525
Being too young and foolish
to face up to them, I took off.

29:21.527 --> 29:24.394
New family,
new woman.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.263
A do-over.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.866
Most folks don't get one.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.234
I made the best of mine.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.770
I built a good business,

29:32.772 --> 29:34.438
And raised three great kids.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.241
Forgetting about the two
that you left behind.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.943
They reminded me too much
of my failures, leon.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.280
Only realized
after jackie wrote me, that

29:43.282 --> 29:46.250
Here I was, this
big success, who

29:46.252 --> 29:48.418
Never truly felt successful.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.220
What do you mean,
she wrote to you?

29:50.222 --> 29:52.422
Last christmas.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.392
I didn't write back.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.327
Couldn't.

29:57.329 --> 30:01.532
And then, a month later, I saw
on tv that she was killed.

30:03.334 --> 30:05.903
Why would that little
girl write this old man

30:05.905 --> 30:07.504
After so much time?

30:07.506 --> 30:10.073
Heart.

30:11.409 --> 30:13.076
Jackie was all heart.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.048
You know, um, some
years ago when I heard

30:18.050 --> 30:20.350
That she was marrying
a man of your position,

30:20.352 --> 30:23.287
I felt so relieved
to think that,

30:23.289 --> 30:25.823
Well, if nothing else,
she would be safe.

30:25.825 --> 30:29.026
Don't get me wrong.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.328
I don't blame you.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.430
But at the same time,
you can't blame me

30:33.432 --> 30:35.866
For wondering about her kids

30:35.868 --> 30:37.501
And about
their safety.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.403
You hear what I'm saying?

30:39.405 --> 30:42.105
Loud and clear.

30:43.408 --> 30:46.343
But you don't have to worry
about anything, addison.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.945
Don't have to worry
about a thing.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.913
Not now, not ever.

30:49.915 --> 30:53.483
You just take care of you,
like always.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.995
And jackie didn't write to you,

31:04.997 --> 31:06.597
By the way--
let's get that straight.

31:06.599 --> 31:10.234
Jackie would write notes
on those cards

31:10.236 --> 31:12.202
To old friends,

31:12.204 --> 31:15.405
To people that she cared about,
but not to you.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.641
Hell, even our trash collector

31:17.643 --> 31:20.944
Got a more personal card
than you got.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.146
It still came.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.115
She reached out.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.017
Maybe because
she wanted you to see

31:27.019 --> 31:29.586
What she accomplished
without you, in spite of you.

31:29.588 --> 31:32.155
You got regrets,
that's on you.

31:32.157 --> 31:35.292
But it's not up to me
and my kids to make 'em go away.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.331
Ain't that the truth.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.634
I apologize, leon.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.005
You have yourself
a happy holiday.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.987
(sighs)
I don't get it.

32:03.989 --> 32:08.258
Now the bacterium is causing
lesions on the kids' skin.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.429
(jimmy grunts)

32:12.431 --> 32:16.934
Obviously, grunfeld died
before they could form on him.

32:16.936 --> 32:20.504
'cause ducky only found
the early stages.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.372
Haven't pulled an all-nighter
since college, abby.

32:22.374 --> 32:24.074
You up for it?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.710
It's not like we have a choice.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.212
But you do. Go home.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.548
You have a meeting
with your birth mother tomorrow.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.317
No, not anymore.
I'm canceling.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.985
What?! No!

32:34.987 --> 32:36.353
We've been rushing things
anyway.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.387
No, you haven't.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.122
Forget about my kid, abby.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.524
All right,
what about these kids?

32:41.726 --> 32:42.659
I'm not leaving.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.463
Not till we figure this out.

32:54.739 --> 32:57.007
Mcgee:
Okay...

32:57.742 --> 33:01.144
All right...

33:01.146 --> 33:03.747
Okay...

33:05.183 --> 33:07.150
(sighs)
34.
(sighs)

33:07.152 --> 33:09.386
Thanks.

33:09.388 --> 33:13.156
Boss, number's up
to 34 sick kids

33:13.158 --> 33:16.259
At eight different hospitals
from portsmouth to baltimore.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.594
And they're all
getting worse.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.497
These families had
to have come in contact

33:20.499 --> 33:21.732
With each other at some point.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.533
We followed up
with everyone here.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.036
Uh, some acquaintances
but no close friends.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.704
Most of the kids
attend different schools.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.439
There's barely any crossover.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.508
Any word from dinozzo?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.576
He's still at
washington general.

33:32.578 --> 33:33.777
Let me check in with him.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.315
I'll be right back.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.120
Excuse me, uh, lieutenant?

33:43.122 --> 33:45.188
Mrs. Daly?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.457
I wanted to apologize
for yesterday.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.793
I... I didn't mean
to make matters worse.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.362
You didn't.

33:52.364 --> 33:56.500
Tim told us how badly
you felt, and... Please, we...

33:56.502 --> 33:59.169
We know everyone is just doing
the best that they can.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.170
(sighs)

34:00.172 --> 34:03.173
Uh, do you mind
if I tell you something?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.343
It's about smallpox.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.278
Are you sure
we want to hear this?
And, uh,

34:08.280 --> 34:10.313
Measles and polio,

34:10.315 --> 34:12.282
Diphtheria,
rinderpest, hookworm,

34:12.284 --> 34:14.651
Rubella and probably
a few others I'm forgetting.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.086
What about them?

34:16.088 --> 34:17.354
These are all diseases

34:17.356 --> 34:19.489
That no one knew
how to cure at one time.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.491
But now
they're gone...

34:21.493 --> 34:24.194
Eradicated, just like
this thing's gonna be.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.496
Statistics are on emma's side.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.567
(laughs gently)

34:33.204 --> 34:34.204
(sniffles)

34:34.206 --> 34:35.505
(laughs gently)

34:36.674 --> 34:38.542
Thank you.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.481
Feel better?

34:44.483 --> 34:46.716
Yeah.

34:48.686 --> 34:51.188
Where's everybody going?

34:51.190 --> 34:54.157
I believe they're sending
nonmedical personnel home.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.592
Friends of abby's?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.328
I think the technical term
is santa's helpers.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.696
Bishop:
Candy stripers.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.598
Volunteers.
We saw them here yesterday.

35:05.203 --> 35:06.436
Oh, I know that look.

35:24.722 --> 35:26.289
(yawns)

35:26.291 --> 35:27.390
Have you been working all night?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.792
(clears throat)

35:28.794 --> 35:30.427
Yes, director. Morning.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.761
Bishop:
Morning, sir.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.530
I've got navy ensign
dorothy williams.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.599
Volunteered at the annapolis
party four days ago.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.567
Williams at annapolis.
Check.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.537
Hey. You're in early.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.572
Yeah. Couldn't sleep.
What's all this?

35:42.574 --> 35:44.274
Looking for patient zero.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.542
We're cross-checking
volunteers

35:45.544 --> 35:47.511
At all military base
holiday parties.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.546
Bishop: Turns out 27
of our afflicted kids

35:49.548 --> 35:51.548
Attended at least one of them
in the last week.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.251
I got petty officer
mike russo.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.419
Volunteered at the navy yard
party three days ago.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.622
Mcgee:
Russo at the navy yard. Check.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.591
Are they all military personnel?
Don't have to be.
Could be anyone.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.728
Caterers, santa's helpers,
guy blowing up the balloons.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.463
Any progress on the diagnosis?

36:06.465 --> 36:08.565
About to check with abby.
No, that's okay.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.234
I'll go. You keep at it.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.370
Can't say
you're not thorough, gibbs.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.771
Hey, leon.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.641
You ever heard of a hail mary?

36:23.681 --> 36:24.648
Vance:
Morning.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.817
How's everybody holding up?

36:27.819 --> 36:30.687
My office just sent these.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.223
The lesions have started turning
purple, which narrows down

36:33.225 --> 36:35.692
The search a bit but not enough.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.460
Abby:
Not yet anyways
'cause we're not done.

36:37.462 --> 36:39.696
I am so not having kids.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.431
Okay, jimmy, that does it.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.599
Excuse us, director,

36:42.601 --> 36:44.501
But something has gotten
into mr. Palmer,

36:44.503 --> 36:47.304
And I would like
to get it out now.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.972
Well, don't
let me interfere.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.807
Abby, listen...
No, you listen.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.542
You know
what's infectious

36:52.544 --> 36:54.644
During the holidays?
Optimism.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.513
Optimism is infectious.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.315
Optimism and...

36:58.317 --> 37:01.585
Joy... Uh, joy and-and...
Kindness.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.619
Kindness.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.554
Carol:
Courtesy.
And charity.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.555
Generosity.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.424
And gratitude.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.558
Selflessness.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.593
Compassion.

37:09.595 --> 37:10.627
Carol:
Forgiveness.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.362
Abby:
Oh, forgiveness is huge.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.496
Carol:
Kindness.

37:13.498 --> 37:14.598
You already said kindness.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.966
I like kindness.

37:15.968 --> 37:17.534
And faith,

37:17.536 --> 37:19.336
Jimmy. Faith.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.271
Faith is infectious.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.540
Life isn't
always perfect,

37:23.542 --> 37:25.942
You know?
But sometimes things

37:25.944 --> 37:27.911
Work out for the best
if you just have faith.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.716
(clears throat)
okay, abby.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.686
Okay.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.422
Okay. Where were we?

37:39.424 --> 37:42.692
We were... Well, you were...

37:44.495 --> 37:45.929
As you were.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.931
I'll have some fresh
coffee sent down.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.966
And some no-bean caffeine,
please?

37:53.437 --> 37:55.438
Gibbs (over speaker):
Abby.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.940
Gibbs, don't sneak up on me
like that.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.341
Is there any chance
that this bacteria

37:58.343 --> 37:59.809
Came from africa?

37:59.811 --> 38:01.311
Africa?

38:01.313 --> 38:02.646
If it's specific
to africa,

38:02.648 --> 38:04.447
That would help explain
why we're having

38:04.449 --> 38:06.049
So much trouble
finding it.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.717
Why, gibbs? Who's from africa?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.319
Possible patient zero.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.388
Otherwise known as santa claus.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.689
Santa claus?
Santa claus?
Santa claus?

38:12.691 --> 38:13.723
Also otherwise known

38:13.725 --> 38:15.625
As marine captain louis boggs.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.362
Guy's played santa claus at
military base parties for years.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.965
Recently returned from a
special operation in the congo.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.566
The congo?
And he's the only person

38:23.568 --> 38:25.568
Who's been to every
military holiday party

38:25.570 --> 38:27.704
In the last few weeks.
Which means he's come in contact

38:27.706 --> 38:29.973
With nearly every kid
at every party.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.009
What we don't know is how he
came in contact with grunfeld.

38:33.011 --> 38:34.411
Yes, we do.

38:34.413 --> 38:35.679
I knew I'd seen a red suit

38:35.681 --> 38:36.980
Go over grunfeld's counter.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.415
This is from a week ago.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.550
Isn't that boggs?
Yeah.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.686
All right, find him.
Get him quarantined

38:42.688 --> 38:44.621
Till somebody figures out
what he's got.

38:44.623 --> 38:47.624
That somebody is about
to be us, gibbs.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.392
Abbs, the congo gets us closer?

38:49.394 --> 38:50.727
Congo gets us
there, gibbs.

38:50.729 --> 38:51.661
I got it.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.763
Meningococcal a.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.366
"a" as in africa. See?
You'd never find that here.

38:56.368 --> 38:57.967
Which is why
we couldn't find it before.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.102
Can it be treated?

38:59.104 --> 39:01.504
Yeah, with the right
antibiotic, sure.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.639
Call the hospitals.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.374
Abby:
Call everybody!

39:06.444 --> 39:09.045
Great job, everybody.

39:11.782 --> 39:15.685
♪

39:26.931 --> 39:28.798
Hi, daddy.
