00:13.012 --> 00:15.015
[whinnying]

00:16.558 --> 00:19.602
-[Trish] No, that's not right.
-Try it there, Ethan.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.481
-[grunts]
-It was better on the other side.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.776
[sighs] I'm so tired.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.029
[sighs] I can't take it anymore.

00:32.115 --> 00:32.949
[grunts]

00:33.908 --> 00:34.743
[goat bleats]

00:34.826 --> 00:38.329
-I guess it works.
-We can move it if we change our minds.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.622
[sighs]

00:44.127 --> 00:45.086
Redecorating?

00:46.087 --> 00:48.631
We thought we'd spruce up the tack room.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.302
Oh, Ethan looks like he could use
some sprucing up himself.

00:53.303 --> 00:57.974
[sighs] Well, I have some news
that might perk you all up a little bit.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.980
Over the next few days,
a film crew is going to be working here,

01:04.064 --> 01:06.983
-at the ranch.
-Cool! They're gonna make a movie?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.443
Not a movie. A commercial.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.529
-For a sports car?
-Burger restaurant?

01:11.613 --> 01:13.782
-Breakfast cereal?
-[chuckles] No!

01:13.865 --> 01:15.825
No, no, no. None of the above.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.579
It's for a line
of designer vitamin juices for horses.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.290
"Miss Hilda's Vita Horsey Juice."

01:22.373 --> 01:23.792
[all] Miss Hilda?

01:24.375 --> 01:26.336
-I love Miss Hilda!
-I know!

01:27.086 --> 01:28.254
"You can tell 'em...

01:28.338 --> 01:31.466
[fingers snap] 'Miss Hilda said so!'"

01:31.883 --> 01:33.218
Everybody loves that.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.470
I'm her biggest fan!

01:35.553 --> 01:38.556
You know she writes, directs
and stars in her own commercials?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.183
She does everything.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.020
And, lucky for us,
she pays for her commercials.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.606
This is going to be huge for fundraising.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.817
I need you to be very helpful

01:48.900 --> 01:51.861
to Miss Hilda and her crew
whenever possible.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.863
The Ponysitters are on it!

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
We won't forget our chores either.

[Olivia] Isabella, Skye said
we should do a lemonade stand.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.031
[Isabella] Great idea!

02:37.323 --> 02:39.409
She said we should sell to the film crew.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.245
So, I told her
that I'd teach you how to run it.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.248
First, we need to find Grandpa.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.084
He said he'd help build
the lemonade stand.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.086
Come on. It's this way.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.217
It has got to be here somewhere.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.261
Don't put yourself out, Grandpa.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.805
Isabella and I will build
a new lemonade stand.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.933
I built it so my daughter
could pass it on to her daughters,

03:04.017 --> 03:06.144
and they could pass it on to theirs.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.355
I did not count on my lousy memory.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.859
-[Isabella] So you sell the lemonade?
-Yeah. [laughs]

03:12.942 --> 03:17.071
We don't give it away for free.
We do it to raise money for Ponysitters.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.656
[clatters]

03:23.578 --> 03:24.412
Found it.

03:24.746 --> 03:28.416
[taps] Good as new.
Told you. Built to last.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.004
Couple of nails, and...

03:34.297 --> 03:35.798
it should be good as new.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.759
Yeah?

03:38.843 --> 03:40.178
No? Not buying it?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806

[chirping]

03:46.935 --> 03:48.436
[nickering]

03:56.611 --> 04:00.698
So this is our riding ring.
We exercise our horses here.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.911
-Where's that Ethan fellow with my coffee?
-Oh.

04:07.413 --> 04:11.876
-Here's your fresh coffee, Miss Hilda.
-Thank you, Ethan. [chuckles]

04:14.170 --> 04:15.171
I guess...

04:17.924 --> 04:18.800
Mmm.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.972
-[Ethan] Yes!
-He's very good.

04:24.055 --> 04:28.059
-Yes, he is. Especially with cameras.
-Okay.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.979
Oh, Trish! Trish!

04:31.437 --> 04:34.524
This is our lovely Miss Trish.
She's one of our Ponysitters.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.985
Miss Hilda! I'm a really big fan!

04:37.777 --> 04:40.822
Well, you're not very big, dear.
But you've got time.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.493
"You can tell 'em,
[fingers snap] 'Miss Hilda said so!'"

04:46.661 --> 04:48.705
-I've seen worse today.
-[both laugh]

04:49.372 --> 04:52.834
-Who do we have over there?
-That is my daughter, Skye.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.003
That's Shelby. She boards a horse here.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.716
-They're really good riders, Miss Hilda.
-I can see that.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.593
Okay.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.972
[bleating]

05:16.733 --> 05:19.068
[Olivia] You were right, Isabella.
Painting this old stand

05:19.152 --> 05:20.486
makes all the difference.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.951
Wow!

05:28.286 --> 05:31.372
Isabella inspired us.
So we painted it the colors of Brazil.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.043
[chuckles] This old rundown stand's
looking good, Dad.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.297
Well, if you ask me, it's a lot of colour.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.597
-Skye! Shelby! Wait till you hear!
-[Apollo whinnying]

05:47.680 --> 05:51.059
Trish! You know how sensitive Apollo is.

05:51.142 --> 05:54.812
He likes when everyone is calm,
cool and collected.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.149
Sorry, Apollo. Sorry, Shelby.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.778
But, Miss Hilda wants
to see you both right away.

06:02.070 --> 06:02.904
Us?

06:02.987 --> 06:05.114
Not Shelby and Apollo. Shelby and Skye.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.658
-Sorry, Apollo.
-[whinnying]

06:07.742 --> 06:08.993
Why does she want to see us?

06:10.369 --> 06:13.539
-You think we did something wrong?
-I didn't do anything wrong.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.124
Come on, let's go!

06:22.924 --> 06:24.467
We'll wait for the horses.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.010
Mmm-hm.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.228
Come on in, girls.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.316
Alright, young ladies.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.277
I saw you riding in the ring
and I'm impressed.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.030
-Really?
-Yes, my dear.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.950
You're both wonderful riders,
very graceful.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.451
Oh, thank you.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.915
That's what we need to see
in this commercial.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.001
-But there's something else.
-Shelby's perfect for it.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.839
Sorry. But she always is.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.300
[sighs]
I'll naturally star in the commercial,

07:06.384 --> 07:10.430
but the actress who was my co-star
has come down with a phlegmy cold.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.183
So, I need to fill the role.
You girls are the right age.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.477
You're beautiful riders.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.562
Oh, thank you.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.524
But I have no idea if you can act.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.111
I'd like to do a screen test tomorrow
if you are interested.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.072
Of course I'm interested!

07:28.156 --> 07:30.366
Er, she's interested.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.828
Shelby, say you're interested.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.080
I'm interested?

07:36.747 --> 07:38.916
What do you think, Skye? No pressure.

07:39.333 --> 07:42.086
It's okay if you don't want to. [chuckles]

07:43.045 --> 07:47.049
I've never tried acting.
I don't know if I can do it.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.969
Go for it. What have you gotta lose?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.054
I'll give it a shot.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.475
[laughs] That's the spirit!
My assistant has the scripts.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.853
One for you, and one for you.

07:58.936 --> 07:59.979
Thank you, Ethan.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.483
Alright, girls. See you tomorrow
at the screen test. Off you go.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.486
[goat bleating]

08:14.702 --> 08:15.536
[sighs]

08:16.496 --> 08:17.622
We need something else.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.168
Like what? We're selling lemonade.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.086
We have lemonade.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.300
Something special
that can catch people's attention.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.720
Something no one's ever tried before.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.972
Special lemonade made with limes.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.142
Lemonade made with limes.

08:39.101 --> 08:43.397
-Like lime-onade? [laughs]
-Yeah, it's great. Trust me.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.691
Okay, are you sure?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.361
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.617
Do you really think I can do this?

08:54.700 --> 08:57.119
-Yes! It'll be fun.
-I don't know.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.498
I have trouble reading the script,
let alone acting it out.

09:00.581 --> 09:03.376
Don't worry, I'll help you.
We'll rehearse the scene tonight,

09:03.459 --> 09:06.420
and I'll play...
[fingers snap] Miss Hilda!

09:07.004 --> 09:10.299
-You are good at that.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

09:10.383 --> 09:12.635
We'll do the scene
till you know it by heart.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.887
You won't have to worry about reading.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.472
[sighs]

09:16.556 --> 09:18.683
Yeah. I guess that could work.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.060
It will work! [giggles]

09:21.143 --> 09:22.353
-[purring]
-Hi.

09:23.729 --> 09:27.275
I was just wondering
if you could do me a favor.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.027
Or rather, if I could do you a favor.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.821
Maybe.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.949
My mom thinks this screen test
is my "big break"

09:35.032 --> 09:37.868
and that I'll be a big star by next week.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.829
That might not happen.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.622
Oh, duh! I know that.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.874
And I don't want it to happen

09:43.958 --> 09:46.502
until my equestrian career peaks
at the Olympics.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.213
-[both laugh]
-Okay.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.507
She is going to drive me crazy.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.303
[sighs] She's gonna tell me how to do
and say everything.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.181
And I already know how it has to be done.
I'm in character.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.518
So, what's the favor?

10:02.768 --> 10:06.355
I heard you talking about rehearsing.
And I'm going to help you.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.026
Sure, that sounds like fun.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.736
Why not? The more the merrier!

10:18.284 --> 10:19.785
Let's go, right now.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.552
In Brazil, this is how my dad
used to make it.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.890
Everybody called it
Thiago's World Famous Lemonade!

10:40.973 --> 10:42.725
[laughs] Cool!

10:45.102 --> 10:47.229
-Here's your condensed milk.
-[pops]

10:47.938 --> 10:48.939
Oh.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.567
[Grandpa] Mmm-hm.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.989
You're using limes?

10:58.449 --> 11:01.077
Kind of throwing out
all the rules, Grandpa.

11:01.327 --> 11:06.248
I've been around the block a few times.
I can't see how that can taste good.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.794
-Taste!
-[Grandpa] Thank you.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.343
-[Grandpa] Mmm.
-[chuckles]

11:17.426 --> 11:19.553
[Grandpa] I need to go around
a few more blocks.

11:20.429 --> 11:25.434
Because that is possibly the best thing
I have tasted in my entire life.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.271
-[Grandpa] Oh.
-This is so good!

11:31.232 --> 11:35.277
Mmm. That is good! That is so good.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.507
I think that is perfect.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.553
-Okay, I guess we should start with--
-Action!

12:43.345 --> 12:44.180
[Trish] Okay, Skye.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.932
You and I will do the first scene.
Shelby and I will do the next.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.392
We'll keep going from there.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.602
-Alright?
-Yep.

12:49.685 --> 12:50.853
Action!

12:50.936 --> 12:52.730
But I just said action.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.690
And let's go!

12:56.901 --> 12:57.985
[sighs]

13:00.321 --> 13:03.282
Oh, sorry. My line's first.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.660
Morning, sunshine!

13:07.745 --> 13:10.206
Oh, morning. Miss Hilda.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.083
[Trish]
What's got you down in the dumps, Gracie?

13:13.167 --> 13:16.795
Are you worried
about the competition tomorrow?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.089
Maybe. A little.

13:19.173 --> 13:22.259
But I'm more worried

13:22.343 --> 13:25.763
about my precious Peter Pony Paulo.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.557
[whispers]
Precious pony Peter-Paulo.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.726
Precious Polo Pony Peter!

13:33.354 --> 13:34.688
Oh, that's not right.

13:35.564 --> 13:36.398
Here.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.484
Let me try.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.239
Precious pony Polo-Peter.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.492
Oh, man, is that a tongue twister.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.202
[laughter]

14:42.339 --> 14:47.595
"Serious Sally sells seashells
on the salty seashore!"

14:48.721 --> 14:49.638
Okay.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.308
"See Sally sell salt."

14:52.391 --> 14:54.768
-Ugh!
-Seriously, Mother?

14:54.852 --> 14:57.605
Concentrate, cupcake! Concentrate!

14:58.022 --> 15:00.024
[groans, vocalizing] Brr-rr!

15:00.649 --> 15:02.151
Brr-rr!

15:03.277 --> 15:05.863
[squeals] Ah-hh!

15:06.572 --> 15:09.074
Ah-ga-ga-gaga, gaga-gaga...

15:10.492 --> 15:12.286
Come on, cupcake.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.622
[both] Ga-ga-gaga, gaga-gaga...

15:15.539 --> 15:18.167
Don't call me cupcake. Ga-ga-gah.

15:19.126 --> 15:25.007
[barking] Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!

15:25.090 --> 15:27.384
-Woof, woof, woof.
-Woof! Woof! Woof!

15:27.468 --> 15:30.763
Okay, if you two Golden Retrievers
are about done,

15:30.846 --> 15:35.225
I'd love to start. Pronto!
Cameraman, are you all set?

15:35.309 --> 15:36.477
Ready when you are.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.605
Alright. If you do a good job
shooting this,

15:39.688 --> 15:42.399
one day I'll move you
to the real commercial.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.028
Alright, actors ready?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.655
-Ready, Miss Hilda!
-Great.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.825
Since you enjoy impersonating me so much,

15:51.909 --> 15:55.871
I'll allow you to play me in the scene
while Ethan films and I observe.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.584
Okay.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.835
Let's do this thing!

16:03.212 --> 16:06.590
-Oh, can I call "action"?
-You're the director.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.678
Oh, thanks. Action!

16:11.178 --> 16:13.347
Morning, sunshine!

16:13.430 --> 16:15.808
Oh! Morning, Miss Hilda.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.436
What's got you down in the dumps, Gracie?

16:19.520 --> 16:22.356
Are you worried
about the competition tomorrow?

16:22.439 --> 16:25.109
Maybe. A little.

16:25.192 --> 16:31.448
But I'm more worried
about my precious pony Peter-Paulo.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.035
What's the problem
with your precious pony Peter-Paulo?

16:35.119 --> 16:40.040
He's not eating with gusto.
And he's really tired, too.

16:40.124 --> 16:44.128
Oh, boy. Well, I know just what to do.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.879
You do?

16:51.927 --> 16:56.432
Ahem. He needs
Miss Hilda's Vitamin Enriched

16:56.515 --> 17:00.394
All-Natural Digestive
Supporting Horsey Juice!

17:00.477 --> 17:02.563
[Skye] I'll have to remember that.

17:02.646 --> 17:06.567
And remember, if any busybody asks
how you know it works,

17:06.650 --> 17:08.110
just tell them...

17:08.193 --> 17:11.822
[fingers snap] "Miss Hilda said so!"

17:13.699 --> 17:14.533
Cut!

17:15.534 --> 17:19.204
[laughs] Very good, ladies. Thank you!

17:21.415 --> 17:24.126
[Billy] Skye, honey! You were fabulous!

17:26.170 --> 17:28.756
[sighs]
I thought my acting was pretty bad.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.885
-But my reading was good, wasn't it?
-It was incredible. Both of you.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.680
Your acting was actually good
but your reading was great!

17:36.889 --> 17:39.641
[chuckles] I'm just glad that's over.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.437
Clear the set, everybody! Clear the set!

17:50.986 --> 17:52.196
Action.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.450
-Morning, sunshine!
-Oh! Morning!

17:56.700 --> 17:59.328
[Shelby] Um, morning, Miss Hilda!

18:00.496 --> 18:05.000
-Whoa! What's got you--?
-I'm down in the dumps, Miss Hilda!

18:05.918 --> 18:10.506
I'm down in the dumps! And I'm Gracie!

18:11.256 --> 18:13.675
[Trish] Okay. That's my line, but--

18:13.759 --> 18:17.679
But I'm more worried about my precious,
precious, precious,

18:17.763 --> 18:20.599
precious, precious pony Peter-Paulo!

18:21.058 --> 18:23.477
[Trish] Okay. What's the problem with--?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.021
He hasn't been eating with gusto!

18:26.105 --> 18:28.857
He seems tired, too! [snores]

18:29.316 --> 18:30.400
[silent] Stop.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.737
Okay, cut! Cut.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.533
That was wonderful.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.119
We'll have our decision shortly.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.218
You know my directing
and camera assistant.

18:57.261 --> 19:03.559
Thank you, ladies, for your auditions.
They were impressive in their own way.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.603
Unfortunately, I don't think
either of you were right.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.980
[Miss Hilda] I'm sorry.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.650
That's okay, Miss Hilda.
It was fun! [giggles]

19:11.733 --> 19:16.029
I beg your-- What?

19:16.446 --> 19:18.907
[Bianca] How could you--? Not right!

19:19.575 --> 19:22.953
That's impossible! She's a star!

19:23.245 --> 19:24.246
It's okay, Mom.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.790
-I didn't want it anyway.
-[whimpers]

19:26.874 --> 19:30.502
I would like to use you as background
riders if that interests you.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.296
-Oh, yes.
-That'd be great.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.464
-I'd love to!
-This is insane!

19:35.549 --> 19:37.134
I also wanted to tell you

19:37.217 --> 19:41.555
that we've decided
to offer the role of Gracie to Trish.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.015
[laughs]

19:43.098 --> 19:43.974
Me?

19:44.057 --> 19:48.270
You were fabulous playing me.
You definitely have the talent.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.899
And I hear you can ride.
The role's yours if you'd like it.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.151
Well, if it's okay with you guys.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.612
-[Skye] Of course.
-[Shelby] Go ahead.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.198
You can't turn down
an opportunity like this.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.908
Okay?

20:00.991 --> 20:06.038
None of this is okay!
Come along, Shelby!

20:06.121 --> 20:07.581
-Mom!
-We're leaving!

20:07.664 --> 20:11.710
But, Mom! Miss Hilda offered me
a job as a background rider.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.170
I'm going to pay her.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.050
I'll pick you up at suppertime! Oh!

20:20.802 --> 20:24.514
-She got over that quick.
-Let's have Trish in hair and makeup.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.850
Trish, can you head to hair and makeup?

20:27.976 --> 20:29.186
Bye, bunnies.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.772
Come on, let's go.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.826
[giggles]

20:44.910 --> 20:48.580
-[Skye] You're gonna do great, Trish!
-[Shelby] Break a leg!

20:48.664 --> 20:51.333
-[Trish] Huh?
-[laughs] It means good luck.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.046
-How are you feeling, kid?
-I'm kind of nervous.

20:56.129 --> 20:59.007
Oh, relax.
You're a very talented young actress.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.261
And you can tell them,
"Miss Hilda said so."

21:03.053 --> 21:04.263
[giggles]

21:04.346 --> 21:07.432
Okay, everybody.
Clear out, clear out, please!

21:08.475 --> 21:12.896
Let's get the lights, camera, and action!

21:14.231 --> 21:16.858
-Morning, Miss Hilda.
-Morning, Gracie.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.653
Thank you.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.784
Thank you.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.244
Hope it works.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.291
Careful with that! We spent a lot of time.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.299
Oh!

21:47.973 --> 21:52.185
Ah, I was supposed
to be teaching you today.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.146
I guess you're teaching me.
