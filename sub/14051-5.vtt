WEBVTT

00:20.800 --> 00:22.200
CAMILLE: OK.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.360
-Trust me, you don't want to know.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.160
To the future! And to Miami!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.480
Ah, you know, I'm probably gonna mess it up

00:36.520 --> 00:38.360
and be right back here before you know it.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.080
No, you won't, you're gonna be a superstar!

00:41.120 --> 00:44.520
-Oh! -Oh, I'm sorry. Let me.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.200
I'll do it. Don't worry. Accidents happen, huh?

00:47.240 --> 00:48.880
Maybe it's for the best.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.360
Wouldn't want your final performance

00:48.920 --> 00:52.360
to be a drunken disaster.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.120
-All right, ladies and gentlemen!

00:58.160 --> 01:01.840
Only a few minutes to go before the best cabaret you will see.

01:01.880 --> 01:08.160
So please, fill your glasses! And prepare to salute

01:01.880 --> 01:08.160
our super sexy singers!

01:08.200 --> 01:13.480
-Eloise and the delicious Aimee!

01:14.920 --> 01:18.040
You ever had a boss you could happily kill?

01:18.080 --> 01:20.640
-No comment. -Five minutes, please.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.360
I'm gonna go and get ready, I'll see you after the show.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.840
-And not too much drinking, young lady.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.840
-BOTH: It's a school night!

01:39.440 --> 01:40.880
Bit early for bed, Milton.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.160
Been working mornings down at the docks.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.360
-Yes.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
That and trying to get some beauty sleep.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.680
Let me tell you a bedtime story. Our Commissioner

01:49.720 --> 01:51.960
is a very unhappy man.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.160
Because there's been a rush of bootleg rum out on the streets

01:55.200 --> 01:56.960
and the bars and the businesses

01:57.000 --> 02:00.080
who make the real stuff are calling him

01:57.000 --> 02:00.080
every day to complain.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.200
So me and Fidel here have been given the task of

02:00.120 --> 02:04.200
finding out who's behind it all.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.640
Ah! That's a lovely story.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.360
In fact, it's a fairytale. I gave that up years ago!

02:09.400 --> 02:12.200
Now, if you don't mind, I need my beauty sleep.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.600
Hey. Nice watch. How could you afford something like that?

02:16.640 --> 02:19.840
If you've been working as a go-between for the bootleggers,

02:16.640 --> 02:19.840
tell him, Milton.

02:19.880 --> 02:21.600
You know what Dwayne's like when he gets annoyed.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.600
Seriously!

02:23.640 --> 02:26.120
Listen, Laurel and Hardy, this is the 21st century.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.480
That stuff doesn't work any more. So shut me door

02:26.160 --> 02:29.480
on your way out.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.760
Idiot!

02:44.480 --> 02:50.320
<i>♪ I'm your key</i> <i>to set you free</i>

-Aimee!

03:44.520 --> 03:46.720
Aimee! Aimee! Aimee!

03:46.760 --> 03:50.560
Aimee! Aimee!

03:50.600 --> 03:52.320
Aimee! Aimee!!

04:35.800 --> 04:39.600
The victim, you say she was a friend of Camille's?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.120
Aimee Fredericks. Old school friend.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.920
Been working away from the island, on and off

04:42.160 --> 04:44.920
for the past few years.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.160
-Seeking fame and fortune. -So it was a reunion of sorts.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.920
Yeah, she was really, really excited about seeing her again.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.720
Right, well, we'd better be ready to pick up the slack.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.320
I doubt Camille's going to be in any frame of mind to work.

04:58.360 --> 05:02.960
Sit down! I'm not going to say it again. This is a crime scene!

05:04.400 --> 05:06.720
Paramedics think it might have been poison.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.000
-Right. Camille... -And if that's the case

05:09.040 --> 05:11.800
then we need possible sources of the poison.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.640
There's a shot glass and an oyster shell.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.560
They'd fallen on the floor but I retrieved them myself, so they

05:14.680 --> 05:18.560
haven't been contaminated.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.160
-I'm on it.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.720
-I don't think so.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.720
As far as I can make out,

05:24.760 --> 05:28.240
the only things she ate or drank were the shot and the oyster.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.520
I meant for you.

05:30.560 --> 05:36.320
I'm Stephen Morrison. The<i> King Papyrus</i>

05:30.560 --> 05:36.320
is my party boat.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.320
I just... I've no idea what happened.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.160
One minute she's up there singing, the next she's...

05:41.200 --> 05:45.800
-We'll be talking to everybody. -I can't believe it!

05:41.200 --> 05:45.800
It's my fault, it has to be.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.560
-I'm in charge

05:45.840 --> 05:48.560
of food and drink here.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.600
She drank the shot, ate the oyster and then collapsed.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.480
All eyes on me, right?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.440
Investigations are ongoing, thank you.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.360
This is now a crime scene, the whole boat

05:56.480 --> 05:59.360
needs to be sealed off.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.840
Any idea how long she'll be out of commission?

06:01.880 --> 06:04.400
As long as it takes. Do you have a problem with that?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.560
No! No.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.840
-You need to sit down. -No, I don't!

06:09.880 --> 06:12.320
-Look, as your commanding officer...

06:09.880 --> 06:12.320
!

06:12.360 --> 06:16.120
As your superior, I'm ordering you to sit down. You're upset.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.960
-You're in shock. It's for your own good.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.920
What are you going to do Suspend me?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.120
It's not meant to be a punishment.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.720
I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to help.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.280
Then help me to find out who did this!

06:33.680 --> 06:37.200
Fidel, we need full names and addresses of all staff

06:33.680 --> 06:37.200
and passengers.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.760
I want written statements and exclusion prints taken.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.120
And lots of people were taking pictures,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.720
I want all cameras and phones handed in before anyone leaves

06:42.160 --> 06:45.720
the boat!

06:45.760 --> 06:47.680
-OK. -Hey.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.000
Thank you.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.960
Sir, thank you. Ma'am, thank you.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.280
-Name. Madam. -Thank you, sir, good night.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.480
-Camera, sir. -It's back at

07:06.320 --> 07:10.480
the Green Bay Hotel, mate.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.960
Names and addresses, please.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.640
These phones and cameras are going to take ages.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.640
And don't forget, we got the bootlegging

07:23.680 --> 07:25.640
to follow up

07:25.680 --> 07:27.120
or the Commissioner will be on our backs.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.560
Yes, Dwayne. I've been thinking about that.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.560
Ah! Go on, then?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.600
I've been thinking, maybe I should just

07:35.280 --> 07:37.600
take the lead, you know?

07:37.640 --> 07:40.040
-Yeah, be in charge

07:37.640 --> 07:40.040
of the investigation.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.560
You want to be my boss?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.400
Well, part of the Sergeant's exam is role play...

07:43.440 --> 07:46.160
Ah, you want to pretend to be my boss.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.440
It's not about anyone being anyone's boss, it's more of

07:46.200 --> 07:50.440
a case of...

07:50.480 --> 07:53.680
-Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

07:53.720 --> 07:55.800
Go on, knock yourself out.

07:55.840 --> 07:56.840
Sherlock.

08:05.960 --> 08:10.400
Last night on the boat. What was that thing you did

08:05.960 --> 08:10.400
with Camille?

08:10.800 --> 08:12.520
Thing?

08:12.560 --> 08:15.360
Sort of...

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400
Oh, that. I was just letting her know that

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400
I'm here if she needs me.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.840
-Yeah, but you didn't say anything.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.840
-I didn't have to.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.000
Right.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.800
So you just look at her and she thanks you.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.480
I try to help, she practically bites my head off.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.440
Chief, a woman like Camille doesn't want "help".

08:30.480 --> 08:33.960
Support, sure, but help? Never.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.680
And you have very soft hands, Chief.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.920
Er, right!

08:39.960 --> 08:43.120
The victim was Aimee Fredericks, 23.

08:43.160 --> 08:47.200
She had worked on the<i> King Papyrus</i> party boat

08:43.160 --> 08:47.200
for six months.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.040
How long had the boat been in Saint Marie?

08:49.080 --> 08:52.600
It arrived back this week, Chief, after a nine week

08:49.080 --> 08:52.600
stint in Guadeloupe.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.640
Antigua and Tobago before that.

08:54.680 --> 08:58.160
So it stops off here about three times a year or so.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.640
According to Camille, Aimee's performance yesterday was going

08:58.200 --> 09:02.640
to be her final one.

09:02.680 --> 09:07.240
She was due to go and work for a producer in Miami

09:02.680 --> 09:07.240
and launch a recording career. But someone, for some reason,

09:07.280 --> 09:11.840
didn't want that to happen.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.400
What have we got on the other passengers?

09:13.440 --> 09:17.840
Ah! We ran a check, they were your usual mix

09:13.440 --> 09:17.840
of holiday-makers,

09:17.880 --> 09:19.720
half a dozen locals.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.760
No-one with criminal records or any links to Aimee

09:19.760 --> 09:22.760
as far as we can see.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.840
The staff checked out clean as well.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.080
I took these with my camera yesterday.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.040
Six good shots, leading up to the, to the incident.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.480
What about the other cameras?

09:38.520 --> 09:41.000
-I'm starting on them now. -OK, let's get a move on.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.200
Sir, we should go and check Aimee's apartment.

09:43.240 --> 09:47.200
Dwayne, I've set up an interview for you with RJ,

09:43.240 --> 09:47.200
the waiter on the boat.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.360
You want to know the secrets of a workplace,

09:47.240 --> 09:51.360
ask the serving staff.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.880
Camille. Camille! Camille, before we go...

09:55.920 --> 09:56.960
What?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.640
What are you doing?!

10:06.000 --> 10:08.760
I don't know. I saw Dwayne doing it before.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.640
-Right, erm, it's just... -It's just

10:08.800 --> 10:12.640
a little bit awkward.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.840
You know, my grandparents had a dog called Laddie.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.840
Irish setter.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.000
You know, he was probably my best friend, you know,

10:27.880 --> 10:32.000
growing up.

10:32.040 --> 10:39.600
And when I was 11, he was, he was hit by a milk...

10:39.640 --> 10:42.520
Well, it wasn't a milk float, it was a milk van.

10:42.560 --> 10:49.360
Anyway, the point, the point I'm trying to make is that...

10:49.400 --> 10:50.800
Look, it was very difficult for me, you know.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.160
And I, I was upset for weeks, months even.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.240
Sir, Aimee was my friend, not a pet. That's different.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.680
No, no, of course, I was... I mean that was just sort of...

11:01.720 --> 11:04.520
Just trying to show you I understand

11:01.720 --> 11:04.520
and can be supportive.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.720
Yeah, well, you don't really seem to have any friends,

11:07.760 --> 11:10.840
so I'm not sure how you could possibly understand.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.720
He was a very clever dog, you know, he could do tricks.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.160
Please, don't support me any more!

11:17.200 --> 11:18.600
No.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.800
POOLE: Sorry.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.760
RJ: Sorry, what was the question again?

11:25.800 --> 11:29.400
DWAYNE: Can you describe your job on the boat?

11:29.440 --> 11:33.400
I'm a waiter. You know, I wait.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.760
I bring food and drink out to customers.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.240
And to Aimee as well?

11:38.280 --> 11:41.680
Yeah. Yeah, they do this bit, it's like part of an act.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.480
<i>She drinks a shot</i> <i>and then swallows an oyster.</i>

11:44.520 --> 11:48.120
-Yeah.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.920
-Yeah, don't see why not.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.800
-Well, anyone, I guess.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.440
I'm always picking stuff up, putting it down.

11:56.480 --> 12:01.840
Tell me about her relationships with the others on the boat?

11:56.480 --> 12:01.840
How about Stephen?

12:01.880 --> 12:05.760
-He's your boss. -Oh. I dunno.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.760
It's just a job, isn't it?

12:05.800 --> 12:10.960
I just rock up, switch off, you know, count down

12:05.800 --> 12:10.960
until I can go home again.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.960
-Science.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.200
-Never mind.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.320
So you don't really have anything that useful

12:16.240 --> 12:20.320
you can tell us, do you? No. I did see, erm,

12:24.480 --> 12:28.920
thingy and the guy have a big argument two days ago.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.640
-The girl.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.160
-You can't keep me here! -Aimee, you're not being fair.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.880
And you think you're being fair? My mind is made up.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.880
You can't stop me.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.200
-We both know that's not true. -I'm getting that money!

12:42.240 --> 12:44.760
And do you know what this money was they were talking about?

12:44.800 --> 12:46.280
Nah, not really.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.040
Hey, how much do you guys get paid?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.000
I could really do with getting a better job.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.240
-I'm not sure this police work is really for you.

12:56.280 --> 13:02.440
-You don't seem the most observant person in the world.

12:56.280 --> 13:02.440
-Oh! Harsh.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.840
But fair. I like it.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.160
Lock's broken.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.960
Possibly someone forced it.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.720
Maybe it just needed repairing.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.360
She complained about that.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.760
Not having a home. Just a rental.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.080
Living out of a suitcase.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.400
It doesn't look like there's been a break-in.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.880
Too clean. No mess.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.160
Maybe somebody was looking for something in particular.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.920
Didn't steal the beer.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.000
A petal.

14:13.040 --> 14:18.640
Phalaenopsis. It's a type of orchid often found

14:13.040 --> 14:18.640
in the Caribbean.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.480
There's no flowers in here.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.160
Hmm.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.880
Ah! Sarge, I interviewed RJ, the waiter.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.800
-He said Aimee and her boss were arguing a few days ago.

14:55.840 --> 14:58.960
He wasn't sure, but he thinks it was about money.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.200
He also said that after he picked up the tray

15:01.240 --> 15:03.080
with the oyster and shot glass from the bar,

15:03.120 --> 15:05.200
just about anyone could have tampered with it.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.120
And the toxicology report came through on Aimee's postmortem.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.440
Here. She was definitely poisoned.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.920
Strychnine. The dosage suggests no more than five minutes from

15:12.480 --> 15:16.920
when it was taken

15:16.960 --> 15:20.160
to her, to her death. I'm sorry.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
How about the oyster shell, the shot glass?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.880
It's strange, but there was no trace of poison on either.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.080
That's impossible. They were the only two things she ate

15:24.920 --> 15:28.080
or drank before she collapsed.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.240
She didn't imbibe anything else?

15:30.280 --> 15:33.160
No, only the cocktail she was drinking with me.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.760
But we shared a pitcher. Random glasses from the table.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.440
Right. I think we should go and talk to Stephen Morrison,

15:36.800 --> 15:41.440
the boat owner.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.040
He has access to all areas of the boat and he was seen arguing

15:44.080 --> 15:46.120
with the victim a few days before.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.320
-As good a place to start as any.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.320
-DWAYNE: Sure.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.520
Anything here?

15:51.560 --> 15:54.400
I'm trying to put together a timeline of the afternoon.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.680
Top left corner, when the party starts,

15:56.720 --> 15:59.120
then later as you go across and down.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.600
A couple of people were taking videos on their mobile phones,

16:01.640 --> 16:04.920
mostly bad quality, but I managed to transfer some stills

16:01.640 --> 16:04.920
where I can.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.760
These customers joking with Aimee during the performance,

16:04.960 --> 16:08.760
do we know anything about them?

16:08.800 --> 16:12.000
Yes. They've all given full written statements

16:08.800 --> 16:12.000
and been interviewed.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.440
-They're just regular family guys.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.440
-Hmm. So we have a victim

16:16.480 --> 16:18.480
murdered in public, in plain view of everyone,

16:18.520 --> 16:22.240
surrounded by cameras and in the company of a police officer.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.160
And not only do we not know who did it, we don't even know how.

16:26.680 --> 16:28.920
Hang on. Here.

16:29.640 --> 16:30.840
Hawaiian shirt.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.440
-It's a video camera.

16:36.480 --> 16:37.920
I never saw one of those in the box.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.960
That's because there wasn't one.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.520
Wait... I remember him.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.760
Of course. How could I forget that shirt?

16:46.800 --> 16:50.040
I think he's staying at the Green Bay,

16:50.080 --> 16:52.200
but I'm pretty certain he said he didn't have a camera.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.400
Ah! Colin Smith, Green Bay Hotel.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.320
Why would he lie about not having a camera?

16:59.360 --> 17:01.840
That's a question I'd very much like to ask him.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.120
This is really rather impressive, Fidel.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.800
Thank you, sir.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.240
OK, thank you. No-one with that name at the Green Bay.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.720
So he lied about that too?

17:12.760 --> 17:16.560
Listen, we'll track him down, OK? I promise.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.720
You and I should go and talk to Stephen Morrison, see what this

17:16.600 --> 17:20.720
argument over money was about.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.960
Hold on, Chief. Commissioner...

17:23.000 --> 17:26.560
Wants us to focus on the bootleggers, but he'll have

17:23.000 --> 17:26.560
to wait.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.240
He's probably busy anyway, tucking into some lobster

17:30.280 --> 17:33.320
or swallowing down an over-priced bottle of plonk.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.120
-Or standing behind you. -Or standing behind me.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.960
And as a gentleman and a scholar,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.560
able to take a joke in the spirit that it was intended.

17:40.600 --> 17:45.400
I'd happily take anything if you've some progress

17:40.600 --> 17:45.400
on my bootleggers.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.120
A certain influential company on the island

17:48.160 --> 17:53.720
who sell a certain brand name of rum are unhappy at having

17:48.160 --> 17:53.720
their product undercut.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.720
FIDEL: I'm in charge of the investigation, sir.

17:56.760 --> 18:00.880
We're sure the distribution is being organised

17:56.760 --> 18:00.880
by a Milton Reynards.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.120
Now if we gather evidence to use as a leverage on him,

18:04.160 --> 18:07.560
I'm fairly sure he'll give up the names of those behind it.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.920
-Very, sir, of course.

18:12.760 --> 18:13.920
How many percent?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.840
86. Erm, 87.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.760
I like your style, son.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.320
-Don't let me down. -No, sir.

18:39.120 --> 18:45.160
-It sounds worse than it is. -You were arguing with someone

18:39.120 --> 18:45.160
days before they were murdered,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.080
how much worse could it be?

18:48.120 --> 18:51.160
We can do this at the police station if you prefer.

18:51.200 --> 18:56.640
Look, Aimee wanted to leave, right? She said she had a deal

18:51.200 --> 18:56.640
with someone in Miami.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.720
That's what we all want, a break!

19:03.760 --> 19:09.200
Look, she had a contract. She had another 18 months left

19:03.760 --> 19:09.200
to run on it.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.000
The only way out of it was to buy herself out of it. That's

19:09.240 --> 19:13.000
what we were arguing about.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.760
-No, I didn't threaten her.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.960
I just made it clear no producer would touch her if they knew she

19:15.800 --> 19:19.960
had a contract somewhere else.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.960
-Yeah. A contract's a contract.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.240
Look, Aimee was a very good act,

19:28.280 --> 19:32.320
but if she'd just waited, we could have all had

19:28.280 --> 19:32.320
our shot together.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.280
And, frankly, that would have been to her advantage.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.440
Because I built this business up from scratch,

19:34.320 --> 19:37.440
I know what I'm doing.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.280
-20 grand.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.480
! -She signed it.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.480
No-one forced her.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.280
She never had that kind of money.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.600
She told me she did and that she would let me

19:44.320 --> 19:47.600
have it when she left.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.520
-I have no idea.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.440
The other singer, Eloise?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.360
-Oh! -I'm so sorry.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.720
I saw her yesterday, she didn't like Aimee.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.800
-It's a workplace,

19:58.760 --> 20:02.800
people have their ups and downs.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.040
-Ellie. Eloise.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.280
She's, she's great,

20:09.320 --> 20:12.120
but one night in a club and I see Aimee singing

20:12.160 --> 20:18.800
and I'm like, "Pow!" I'm sold. Star quality.

20:18.840 --> 20:22.160
And Eloise was fine with that, being relegated to singing

20:18.840 --> 20:22.160
back

20:22.200 --> 20:26.880
She knew it was a business decision.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.880
We're in this together.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.400
You know, in sickness and in health.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.200
! -Eight years.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.000
So you brought in someone younger

20:34.040 --> 20:38.240
to replace your own wife at work and you say

20:34.040 --> 20:38.240
this wasn't an issue?!

20:38.280 --> 20:42.000
And Aimee wanting to buy herself out of a contract early

20:38.280 --> 20:42.000
wasn't an issue either?

20:42.040 --> 20:44.600
Losing your star attraction didn't hurt at all?

20:44.640 --> 20:46.720
GRANT: Hello. Sorry.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.960
Excuse me, nobody's allowed on the boat.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I was hoping to pick up my knives. They are rather

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
expensive, so...

20:53.040 --> 20:56.360
Sorry, but everything has to remain where it is

20:53.040 --> 20:56.360
for the time being.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.720
If they do go missing, I'll hold you responsible.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.200
Wait a second, you were in charge of all food and drink

20:58.760 --> 21:02.200
yesterday, is that right?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.800
Yeah. Yeah.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.760
Did Aimee eat anything other than the oyster

21:03.840 --> 21:06.760
and the shot?

21:06.800 --> 21:11.160
No, she wouldn't have done. Staff can't eat until

21:06.800 --> 21:11.160
after the guests, so no.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.800
Except for the cocktails she was drinking with you.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.560
But there's nothing else?

21:16.600 --> 21:20.480
No. Oh, maybe the gargle bottles.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.880
They do that before every show to soothe the vocal chords.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.280
They keep the bottles here, back stage.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.600
Well, they're meant to.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.440
That's them.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.040
STEPHEN: Yeah, that's them.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.840
Have the police been to see you yet?

22:00.680 --> 22:03.360
-No. -Well, they will.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.760
The gargle bottles, did you move them?

22:13.120 --> 22:15.040
Why?

22:16.840 --> 22:20.480
Ellie, what have you done?

22:24.880 --> 22:28.960
If the man in the Hawaiian shirt is going to be anywhere,

22:24.880 --> 22:28.960
I think we'll find him here.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.760
He was filming the event,

22:30.800 --> 22:34.240
so it suggests he likes to keep a distance

22:30.800 --> 22:34.240
between himself and the others.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.800
Excuse me.

22:37.400 --> 22:41.120
So, you think he's off to the side alone, filming everything?

22:41.160 --> 22:42.680
Yeah, I think so, maybe.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.760
Look.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.320
Fidel, you're a married man, you know.

22:53.240 --> 22:55.400
No! There.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.400
OK.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.680
Right! This time we do it my way.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.840
Were you on the<i> King Papyrus</i> party boat yesterday?

23:18.880 --> 23:23.480
I was, yeah. Then I'm going to have to ask you to hand over

23:18.880 --> 23:23.480
that camera.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.760
Hey, that's private property.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.640
Look, we can do this the easy way

23:25.800 --> 23:29.640
or the hard way.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.680
So which is it to be?

23:31.720 --> 23:33.560
Fidel! Camera!

23:50.400 --> 23:54.160
Yeah, right!

23:50.400 --> 23:54.160
-All right, all right.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.760
We should still be able to retrieve the data,

23:54.200 --> 23:58.760
if we're lucky.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.520
!

24:06.560 --> 24:07.680
Honore Police.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.800
-POOLE:<i> Fidel.</i> <i>-Hi, sir.</i>

24:08.840 --> 24:10.480
<i>I was just looking for Camille.</i>

24:10.520 --> 24:12.600
<i>I think she said</i> <i>she might go to the beach.</i>

24:24.400 --> 24:26.280
Camille?

24:30.760 --> 24:33.520
-Yes, I'll be back to

24:30.760 --> 24:33.520
work in a minute.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.800
Yes.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.120
Right. Yeah.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.200
-Sitting down.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.320
In the sand?

25:00.880 --> 25:03.280
I'm not very much use to you, am I?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.840
Yes, you are. You're...

25:07.560 --> 25:09.680
You're fantastic.

25:09.720 --> 25:14.040
You know, you've, you've just lost your friend.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.200
All the more reason to stop being so useless and

25:14.080 --> 25:18.200
help you to find her killer.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.600
You're not a machine, you're a person.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.520
You know, when you care about someone...

25:33.640 --> 25:36.520
...sometimes it's hard to...

25:37.960 --> 25:41.040
be eloquent, you know, about how you feel.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.680
To, to tell them how much...

25:45.720 --> 25:51.800
...how much they mean... meant to you.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.080
How important they are in your life and how special.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.280
I've never heard you talk like this before.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.880
No, just trying, you know...

26:04.920 --> 26:09.480
-Exactly.

26:09.520 --> 26:15.560
Well, I think it's very sweet of you. And better

26:09.520 --> 26:15.560
than the dog story.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.520
We, we got the results back on the gargle bottles.

26:28.160 --> 26:31.200
We found traces of strychnine in Aimee's bottle.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.800
-Aimee's fingerprints

26:31.240 --> 26:34.800
were on her bottle alone.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.520
Eloise's were on both.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.280
-So that's it. -Maybe.

26:42.040 --> 26:46.720
But if she only gargled, would the poison

26:42.040 --> 26:46.720
still have killed her?

26:46.760 --> 26:49.240
Absolutely. Oh, and there was something else.

26:51.080 --> 26:57.440
Rather oddly, Aimee's bottle contained

26:51.080 --> 26:57.440
traces of rosehip hairs.

26:57.480 --> 27:00.160
Well, it's an irritant. Sometimes used

26:57.480 --> 27:00.160
in itching powder.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.480
So the question is, who'd put an irritant

27:03.520 --> 27:07.760
in a bottle used by a singer to gargle just before she

27:03.520 --> 27:07.760
went on stage?

27:08.800 --> 27:11.280
Another singer.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.720
FIDEL: Let's see if this camera works.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.120
MAN: "Oh, yeah, baby! Come on! Oh, yeah! Come on! That's it!"

27:21.600 --> 27:24.800
MAN: "Oh, yeah! Come on!"

27:24.840 --> 27:28.640
"That's it! That's it! Don't stop that!"

27:42.840 --> 27:45.840
-No, thanks.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.600
What beautiful flowers.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.840
Oh. A romantic gesture from Stephen.

27:52.880 --> 27:56.320
-Orchids. -Yeah, they look very fresh.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.840
Yeah, he bought them this morning. Sorry, how can I help?

27:58.880 --> 28:00.840
We just wanted to check on something.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.080
-The gargle bottles you used before the show.

28:04.120 --> 28:08.240
For hygiene.

28:04.120 --> 28:08.240
-Yes.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.280
Just a mix of honey and lemon.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.120
It's just that your fingerprints were found on Aimee's bottle.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.800
Well, I must have picked it up by mistake.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.600
And we also found traces of strychnine,

28:18.640 --> 28:20.760
which was the poison used to kill her.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.640
I swear, I didn't...

28:25.200 --> 28:26.640
I didn't do that.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.920
-I didn't.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.480
No? Very well, tell us about the rosehip.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.720
What?

28:40.760 --> 28:42.840
Traces were found in Aimee's bottle.

28:42.880 --> 28:43.920
It's an irritant. But you know that, don't you?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
You scoop out the hair inside the flower.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.120
Oh, look, you have some in your garden.

28:52.680 --> 28:53.840
Mrs Morrison?

28:58.200 --> 28:59.840
You have to understand what it was like.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.000
I mean, Stephen just turned up with her one day

29:02.040 --> 29:05.480
and said she was singing lead. There was no explanation,

29:02.040 --> 29:05.480
no apology.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.080
I mean, he said I was talented.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.880
That he could fulfill my dreams.

29:10.920 --> 29:15.720
Well, apparently those dreams were to sing endless back-up

29:15.760 --> 29:17.680
for someone prettier and more talented than me,

29:17.720 --> 29:18.960
on some tacky party boat.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.120
I didn't, I didn't want to hurt her.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.280
<i>I just wanted to ruin</i> <i>her final performance.</i>

29:28.320 --> 29:30.560
<i>I know that's petty</i> <i>and childish.</i>

29:30.600 --> 29:33.360
<i>I even asked Grant for</i> <i>something from the kitchen,</i>

29:30.600 --> 29:33.360
<i>a chilli maybe,</i>

29:33.400 --> 29:36.840
<i>but when he talked me</i> <i>out of it,</i>

29:33.400 --> 29:36.840
<i>I used the rosehip instead.</i>

29:36.880 --> 29:41.560
I, I swear, I swear to you I didn't kill her.

29:41.600 --> 29:46.960
I just wanted to humiliate her, the way I'd been humiliated!

29:47.000 --> 29:49.280
I knew the bottles would be found.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.800
And if the rosehip was traced back to me,

29:50.840 --> 29:52.440
I mean, everyone knew I hated her.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.400
I thought she had an allergic reaction, I panicked.

29:56.440 --> 29:58.160
So you admit you hid the bottles?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.520
Yes.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.680
-Eloise Morrison, I'm arresting you on suspicion...

30:00.560 --> 30:02.680
-No!

30:02.720 --> 30:04.480
Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.200
-We're not arresting her. -She's practically admitted it.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.600
Camille, you're not thinking straight.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.400
Why use rosehip and poison? Think about it!

30:13.440 --> 30:16.120
Why try to humiliate someone when you know they're going

30:13.440 --> 30:16.120
to be dead

30:16.160 --> 30:18.400
in five minutes anyway? It doesn't make sense.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.120
My colleague and I have discussed the situation

30:25.160 --> 30:28.320
and we have decided we would like you to

30:25.160 --> 30:28.320
surrender your passport

30:28.360 --> 30:30.280
and phone into the station every hour.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.040
So, sorry, am I, am I under arrest or not?

30:35.080 --> 30:36.400
Not yet, no.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.920
POOLE: I know she's a strong suspect,

30:44.240 --> 30:46.920
but that's not enough.

30:46.960 --> 30:48.480
CAMILLE: But the orchids at her house?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.920
POOLE: Which she said came from her husband.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.880
It's a petal. From Phalaenopsis. An orchid.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.760
No? That's odd. I understand and it's your

30:56.920 --> 31:00.760
romantic flower of choice.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.840
I really don't understand what you're getting at.

31:02.880 --> 31:06.440
I think you do. This morning, before we saw you

31:02.880 --> 31:06.440
on the boat here,

31:06.480 --> 31:09.280
-I'm not sure.

31:09.320 --> 31:12.680
POOLE:<i> I suggest</i> <i>you gave Aimee some flowers</i>

31:12.720 --> 31:15.640
<i>and after her death,</i> <i>believing they might</i>

31:12.720 --> 31:15.640
<i>implicate you in some way,</i>

31:15.680 --> 31:17.600
<i>you went to her apartment</i> <i>and retrieved them.</i>

31:17.640 --> 31:20.040
<i>And waste not, want not,</i>

31:20.080 --> 31:22.200
you then gave them to your wife, didn't you?

31:22.240 --> 31:23.560
It's not what you think.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.760
I dropped those flowers off with Aimee yesterday,

31:25.800 --> 31:28.640
as a last-ditch attempt to try and get her to stay.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.240
-No!

31:31.280 --> 31:33.120
-But you wanted to. -No!

31:34.640 --> 31:38.400
Look, when Aimee told me she had the money to buy herself

31:38.440 --> 31:41.000
out of her contract, I really thought I was losing her.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.840
So the flowers were just a stupid idea.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.240
The card with them could have been misconstrued.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.560
By your wife?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.520
You've got to believe me.

31:58.840 --> 31:59.920
Please.

32:08.480 --> 32:09.920
DWAYNE: Oh, it must be nice,

32:09.960 --> 32:13.640
sampling the merchandise in the afternoon. Relax.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.760
It's not a crime.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.160
No. But organising the distribution of bootleg

32:15.800 --> 32:19.160
liquor is.

32:19.200 --> 32:23.080
You think I'm selling rum to the bar

32:28.000 --> 32:30.280
Right. No, don't.

32:30.320 --> 32:33.480
Look, if I go into the bar, turn up the heat,

32:30.320 --> 32:33.480
someone will rat him out.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.280
No, Dwayne, listen. I'm in charge, OK?

32:35.320 --> 32:37.080
We have to do this by the book.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.320
In the old days we'd have rapped him across the head

32:37.120 --> 32:39.320
with the book.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.920
We can use a paid informant.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.760
Someone to go in there on our behalf.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.080
Really

32:52.880 --> 32:54.400
Him?!

32:54.440 --> 32:56.080
You have any better ideas?

32:56.120 --> 32:59.080
That don't involve throwing things around

32:56.120 --> 32:59.080
or shouting at people?

33:02.200 --> 33:03.480
RJ: Right, so let me get this straight,

33:03.520 --> 33:06.240
you want me to go into the bar and...

33:06.280 --> 33:08.320
-Tell them you're having a party.

33:08.360 --> 33:10.920
-A birthday party. -Yeah, but it's

33:08.360 --> 33:10.920
not my birthday.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.680
It doesn't matter!

33:12.720 --> 33:15.320
What you need to let them know is you'd like to buy

33:12.720 --> 33:15.320
50, 60 bottles.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.040
See if you can find out the name of their supplier.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.200
-I dunno. I don't really want to...

33:18.080 --> 33:22.200
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

33:22.240 --> 33:24.840
I thought you said you wanted to be a policeman.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.240
Yeah, think of this as a training exercise.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.320
-Oh. So it's like a job. -Exactly.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.720
Oh, sweet, and if I do well, I can be a policeman?

33:33.960 --> 33:35.200
Go!

33:38.960 --> 33:41.520
The secret of being a good chef is picking the right produce.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.200
I mean, look at that - it's so beautiful.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.600
It seems a shame to pull them out of the ocean, kill them,

33:45.640 --> 33:49.000
-cook them and eat them... -We wanted to talk to you

33:45.640 --> 33:49.000
about Aimee.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.640
Now was there anything going on between her and Stephen?

33:52.680 --> 33:55.440
Oh, he wishes. No. She was a good girl, wasn't she?

33:55.480 --> 33:56.920
More than that, she was smart.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.560
I think she saw him for what he was.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.240
And what's that?

34:00.280 --> 34:03.560
Well, he fancies himself as a bit of an impresario,

34:00.280 --> 34:03.560
doesn't he? But he's just a cheap salesman

34:03.600 --> 34:06.880
in an even cheaper suit, if you ask me.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.960
But there were tensions between Eloise and Aimee?

34:10.000 --> 34:12.440
She missed her chance at the big time and

34:10.000 --> 34:12.440
Aimee's star was rising.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.480
It couldn't have been easy.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.000
Don't think that makes her a murderer - human maybe,

34:17.040 --> 34:18.360
but not a murderer.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.720
Do you think Eloise meant to harm her in any way?

34:20.760 --> 34:22.800
I'm sure she would have liked to have wrung her bloody neck.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.800
Not literally. Figuratively, of course.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.720
See, if you had listened to me, we'd have been

34:37.880 --> 34:40.720
in and out already.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.680
Warm and dry! Done and dusted!

34:42.720 --> 34:44.840
Dwayne! You're not helping.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.760
Hey!

34:51.800 --> 34:54.200
So, er, you got a name?

34:54.240 --> 34:57.040
Whoa, whoa! Money first, come on.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.560
Name first. Then money.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.200
That's how this thing works.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.640
Ah!

35:04.680 --> 35:06.040
Now talk.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.520
Jealous rival Eloise had opportunity,

35:10.560 --> 35:14.880
but why put rosehip in a bottle you knew contained strychnine?

35:14.920 --> 35:17.520
Boss Stephen was clearly smitten with her

35:17.560 --> 35:18.800
and desperate to stop her leaving.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.680
But do you really give someone flowers

35:20.720 --> 35:22.120
the day before you murder them?

35:23.640 --> 35:25.880
Then there's our mysterious Hawaiian shirt man.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.840
And waiter RJ clearly had access to the shot glass

35:28.880 --> 35:31.960
and the oyster, but did he have access to the gargle bottles?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.160
Why not? He went everywhere serving drinks.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.840
And we have no way of knowing when the poison was put

35:35.200 --> 35:37.840
in the bottle.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.000
In which case Grant, the chef, could have done it too.

35:40.040 --> 35:43.200
But we don't have a motive for any of them.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.720
Which brings us back to Eloise again!

35:48.040 --> 35:49.640
We just got confirmation that the bootlegging

35:49.680 --> 35:51.000
is going through Milton Reynards.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.840
Good job, Fidel.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.280
The Commissioner will be pleased.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.440
Yes, but we still don't have any hard evidence on him.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.640
Well, it's a start. Pick it up again in the morning.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.840
-See if you can get a confession.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.840
-OK.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.920
Oh, and the video camera, there was a bit of damage

36:03.960 --> 36:07.440
but I managed to transfer it to stills, I put it up

36:03.960 --> 36:07.440
on the board.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.240
Anything new? No, not that I can see, no.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.720
So why would he lie about having a camera?

36:13.760 --> 36:14.960
We found him in a local drinking den.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.880
He's supposed to be here on business,

36:17.920 --> 36:21.120
only he's been squeezing in a little bit of rest and

36:17.920 --> 36:21.120
recreation too.

36:21.160 --> 36:23.560
He met up with a lady friend on the night before the boat party

36:23.600 --> 36:26.640
and, well, they made a video.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.440
He was worried his wife would find out.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.320
Even I was shocked.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.000
-So he's not our killer either. -DWAYNE: No.

36:35.120 --> 36:38.360
Look, it's late, you two should get yourselves home.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.040
Sir.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.520
<i>♪ Let me tell you</i>

36:50.560 --> 36:56.040
<i>♪ I'm all alone</i> <i>this lonesome road I roam</i>

36:56.080 --> 37:01.680

<i>♪ I've got a hard road</i> <i>to travel... ♪</i>

37:20.480 --> 37:22.640
-POOLE: Morning, team. -Sir.

37:22.680 --> 37:26.280
Camille. How are you feeling?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.560
Better, thank you, sir.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.040
Good.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.720
Wow, everyone's early today!

37:32.760 --> 37:34.840
If I'd known, I'd have brought coffee.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.040
You two should go and see Milton Reynards.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.560
I promised the Commissioner a result on his bootlegging today.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.920
He won't know what's hit him.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.280
-Come!

37:46.240 --> 37:47.720
Let's go catch a rat.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.400
Come now!

37:57.760 --> 37:59.680
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

37:59.720 --> 38:01.960
We've got every conceivable angle of the bar,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.040
the dance floor and the entrance.

38:04.080 --> 38:08.560
Not a single photograph of the backstage area where

38:04.080 --> 38:08.560
the gargle bottles were kept.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.280
So we have no way of knowing who put the poison in or when.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.160
Except, look at the pictures here.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.240
Just before Aimee comes on stage,

38:16.280 --> 38:19.440
only Eloise comes out from the backstage area. Look.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.680
It has to be her!

38:26.160 --> 38:28.360
I just wish you'd trust me on this.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.720
Yes, going by the book can work.

38:31.760 --> 38:35.120
But sometimes the old ways, you know, getting in their face,

38:35.160 --> 38:36.520
shaking them up a bit...

38:36.560 --> 38:38.320
Look, I can't go intimidating witnesses

38:38.360 --> 38:40.120
if I want to be a sergeant.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.520
-OK. Fine, fine.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.800
Go on. You go ahead, I'll catch you in a minute.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.760
-I don't want to get in your way.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.760
-Don't be like that.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.080
I have a family to support. A future to think about.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.600
-How to relax. -I don't need to learn

38:51.560 --> 38:53.600
how to relax!

38:53.640 --> 38:55.160
No. Of course not.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.960
Clearly you're very calm and collected.

38:57.600 --> 38:59.320
Go on then, go!

39:03.040 --> 39:05.000
You really should get a lock for that door.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.440
Haven't we been here before

39:07.480 --> 39:10.760
Oh, great. Good cop is now all concerned. What a surprise.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.720
Look, Milton, you're going to have to come clean, OK?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.280
We've been given your name as the bootleg dealer.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.400
Where are you getting it from?

39:16.440 --> 39:18.960
I can start going through all of your financial records,

39:19.000 --> 39:20.960
-all of your business, everything.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.960
-I'm sleeping.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.920
-I need a result on this case! -I need my rest. I'm tired.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.640
You're tired?! Do you know what time I have to wake up

39:23.960 --> 39:26.640
in the morning?

39:26.680 --> 39:28.520
Do you?! No, no, no, I don't know either!

39:28.560 --> 39:31.040
All I know is that it's dark and my baby's just crying.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.400
I've got work, I've got classes, I've got homework

39:33.440 --> 39:36.040
and in between, I'd love to spend some quality time

39:33.440 --> 39:36.040
with my wife.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.400
But I can't because there is no time and I've had enough of you!

39:39.440 --> 39:41.920
Tell me who's supplying the hooch, where you're

39:39.440 --> 39:41.920
getting it from,

39:41.960 --> 39:43.920
and who did that to your face. The sooner I can make a break

39:43.960 --> 39:45.840
on this case, the sooner I can get some rest.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.760
But if you hold out one moment longer, tired or not,

39:48.800 --> 39:50.760
I will not be held responsible for my actions.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.120
OK, OK, I'll talk! I'll talk. Just... Dwayne!

39:54.160 --> 39:55.800
You need to learn to relax.

39:57.200 --> 40:01.000
-Oh, thank God. -Oooh. Yeah.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.040
Sometimes the old ways are the best.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.400
What am I missing?

40:09.440 --> 40:11.280
Milton talked.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.960
He gave up the names of the people producing

40:11.320 --> 40:13.960
the bootleg rum.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.480
We can head over and pick it up later.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.840
That should get the Commissioner off our backs. Well done.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.120
You should have seen him, Chief. He made me so proud.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.520
Oh, by the way, there's something else I think

40:24.560 --> 40:26.320
-maybe we should keep an eye on.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.160
Milton wanted to siphon off some of the bootleg

40:28.200 --> 40:31.240
he'd been distributing, you know, make a little bit

40:28.200 --> 40:31.240
on the side.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.400
A criminal and an entrepreneur, how impressive.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.760
So anyway, old Milton's down at the harbour

40:35.800 --> 40:37.880
and he sees this box of empty bottles outside

40:37.920 --> 40:40.640
the<i> King Papyrus</i> party boat, just sitting there.

40:40.680 --> 40:42.760
So he goes to grab them, then out of the blue,

40:42.800 --> 40:45.640
suddenly these guys jump him!

40:45.680 --> 40:48.280
They beat him up real bad, you see, Chief.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.560
-Yes, beer bottles.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.280
Palm Tree beer, it's a local brew.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.360
-Well, write it up in your report.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.360
-Yes, Chief.

41:00.320 --> 41:03.040
I've spent hours looking at them. Nothing.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.560
Do you know how many murders I've investigated?

41:05.600 --> 41:07.680
And in how many of them do you think I had photographs

41:07.720 --> 41:10.840
of the murder scene while the murder

41:07.720 --> 41:10.840
was taking place?

41:14.240 --> 41:16.280
Maybe we...

41:16.320 --> 41:17.560
What?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.200
Oh, my God!

41:21.760 --> 41:24.280
-Quick, here, look! -I can't see anything.

41:24.320 --> 41:27.240
No, not the photographs, the... What's it called?

41:24.320 --> 41:27.240
The decoration!

41:27.280 --> 41:28.320
The mirror thing. Look.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.840
There's Aimee getting ready backstage,

41:32.880 --> 41:35.160
then she reaches for her gargle bottle,

41:35.200 --> 41:38.240
but look here, see, she drops something.

41:38.280 --> 41:41.040
And then, she's distracted by...

41:41.080 --> 41:42.560
CAMILLE: Perhaps her music cue?

41:42.600 --> 41:44.440
POOLE: That's it, of course! Then look here.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.920
She heads straight for the stage. Which means...

41:44.480 --> 41:46.920
She didn't gargle.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.720
But how can that be? The poison was...

41:48.760 --> 41:50.600
That's why nothing made sense. We took a wrong turn

41:50.640 --> 41:53.680
and never got back on track. By focusing on the gargle bottles,

41:53.720 --> 41:56.640
we looked away from what was really important. Fidel,

41:56.680 --> 41:58.640
the forensic report on the oyster shell

41:58.680 --> 41:59.800
and the shot glass, if you would.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.040
Yeah, of course. Fingerprints.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.960
A shot glass and an oyster shell.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.360
They had fallen on the floor, but I retrieved them myself,

42:08.400 --> 42:10.480
so they haven't been contaminated.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.480
POOLE:<i> That's it. But why?</i>

42:13.520 --> 42:15.600
<i>How long had the boat</i> <i>been in Saint Marie?</i>

42:15.640 --> 42:17.280
It arrived back this week, Chief,

42:17.320 --> 42:19.360
after a nine-week stint in Guadeloupe.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.080
Antigua and Tobago before that.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.720
DWAYNE:<i> Milton sees</i> <i>this box of bottles</i>

42:22.760 --> 42:25.400
outside the<i> King Papyrus</i> party boat, so he goes to grab them.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.680
<i>Suddenly these guys jump him.</i>

42:27.720 --> 42:29.520
<i>They beat him up real bad,</i> <i>you see, Chief.</i>

42:29.560 --> 42:31.280
FIDEL:<i> Palm Tree beer,</i> <i>it's a local brew.</i>

42:32.640 --> 42:34.600
The bottle.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.760
That's why it wasn't in the fridge.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.200
-Dwayne! -Chief.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.240
Go over to Aimee Fredericks' apartment,

42:40.280 --> 42:43.000
there's a beer bottle in one of the kitchen cupboards,

42:43.040 --> 42:45.240
bring it to the<i> King Papyrus</i> as fast as you can.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.360
-On my way, Chief. -Fidel, get everyone together

42:47.400 --> 42:49.560
and get them to the boat. OK, right, OK.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.960
Now I know where to look. Excuse me.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.840
How did...

42:58.120 --> 43:01.520
Ah! There you are!

43:01.560 --> 43:03.520
Yeah, and there, very clever. Very good.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.280
Very good.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.160
Two days ago, Aimee Fredericks was poisoned and killed

43:09.200 --> 43:11.880
during what was to be her final number.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.760
And yet there seemed to be no way it could have happened.

43:14.800 --> 43:20.560
She ate an oyster and, er, drank from a shot glass.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.840
But when tested, neither showed any trace of poison.

43:22.880 --> 43:25.560
Yet there were traces of poison

43:25.600 --> 43:28.040
in the bottle Aimee used to gargle with,

43:28.080 --> 43:29.960
along with an irritant. Rosehip.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.800
The rosehip was put in the bottle backstage by Eloise.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.680
The aim was to make it impossible for Aimee to sing

43:35.840 --> 43:39.680
that afternoon,

43:39.720 --> 43:41.400
to humiliate her.

43:41.440 --> 43:44.920
Yet she denies putting poison in the bottle.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.280
I believe her. Not that it matters whether she did

43:44.960 --> 43:48.280
or she didn't,

43:48.320 --> 43:49.800
because on the afternoon in question,

43:49.840 --> 43:51.560
Aimee didn't use that bottle.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.360
The poison we found in it wasn't what killed her.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.800
This whole thing started when Aimee was offered

43:55.400 --> 43:58.800
a job in Miami.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.680
She worked hard, waiting for her big break.

44:01.720 --> 44:03.680
She was determined not to let it slip away.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.560
But her boss Stephen didn't want to let her go.

44:05.600 --> 44:08.240
He pointed out there was a clause in her contract

44:05.600 --> 44:08.240
which meant

44:08.280 --> 44:11.200
it would cost her 20,000 dollars to buy herself out.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.120
I'm getting that money.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.480
POOLE:<i> He even tried</i> <i>to seduce her in an attempt</i>

44:13.160 --> 44:16.480
<i>to get her to stay.</i>

44:16.520 --> 44:17.720
CAMILLE:<i> Tried and failed.</i>

44:20.360 --> 44:23.400
Aimee knew Stephen well enough to know that he'd quite happily

44:23.440 --> 44:26.240
call her producer in Miami to ruin her big chance.

44:26.280 --> 44:28.680
So she decided to try and find the money.

44:28.720 --> 44:32.400
She was excited about going to Miami, so she

44:28.720 --> 44:32.400
must have found it.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.240
Where from?

44:35.280 --> 44:37.680
If Aimee wasn't killed by the poison in the gargle bottle,

44:37.720 --> 44:39.040
how was she killed?

44:43.360 --> 44:47.960
It's simple, really. Sometimes it's easy

44:43.360 --> 44:47.960
to overlook the obvious,

44:48.000 --> 44:50.520
thinking it can't possibly be true, but it was.

44:50.560 --> 44:53.760
Aimee was killed when, in plain view of everyone in the room,

44:53.800 --> 44:55.120
she ate the oyster,

44:55.160 --> 45:00.440
and then she drank the poison from the shot glass.

45:00.480 --> 45:04.280
Because the glass we found didn't contain

45:00.480 --> 45:04.280
any traces of poison,

45:04.320 --> 45:05.960
we missed the other forensic details.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.040
All attention was on the gargle bottle.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.720
Which was nothing more than a distraction,

45:11.760 --> 45:13.880
and I really wish I hadn't done that strange hand wave.

45:13.920 --> 45:17.080
The point being, the shot glass

45:17.120 --> 45:19.160
should have had two sets of fingerprints on it.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.160
Grant's because he prepared it,

45:21.200 --> 45:23.040
<i>and Aimee's</i> <i>because she drank it.</i>

45:23.080 --> 45:25.280
<i>Yet there was only one set</i> <i>of fingerprints found.</i>

45:25.320 --> 45:27.760
-It wasn't the same shot glass.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.360
Exactly!

45:29.400 --> 45:30.640
And once you know that, well,

45:30.680 --> 45:33.520
you know that only the killer would change it,

45:33.560 --> 45:37.520
so therefore only the killer's fingerprints would be on it.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.040
Hmm, isn't that right, Grant?

45:40.080 --> 45:41.840
What are you asking me for?

45:41.880 --> 45:44.800
Because your prints were the only ones found on the clean

45:41.880 --> 45:44.800
shot glass.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.240
You killed Aimee Fredericks.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.240
You've been out in the sun too long,

45:49.280 --> 45:51.680
you've fried your brain, you need to see a doctor.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.280
So should you. Nasty cut on your hand.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.480
Should be more careful.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.480
<i>You knew that this being</i> <i>Aimee's last performance,</i>

45:58.520 --> 46:00.000
<i>your time was running out.</i>

46:04.360 --> 46:07.280
<i>After she drank the poison,</i> <i>it quickly took effect.</i>

46:07.320 --> 46:08.880
Aimee. Aimee!

46:08.920 --> 46:12.080
<i>The tray was on the table</i> <i>when the table toppled over,</i>

46:12.120 --> 46:15.600
<i>but a shot glass is small</i> <i>and thick - it didn't smash.</i>

46:15.640 --> 46:18.120
<i>With the distraction,</i> <i>you saw your chance.</i>

46:20.080 --> 46:21.840
<i>As you swapped it</i> <i>for a replacement,</i>

46:21.880 --> 46:25.480
<i>you cut your hand</i> <i>on the broken glass around it.</i>

46:25.520 --> 46:27.400
I think you were probably standing round about here.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.520
So you're effectively holding the murder weapon

46:31.560 --> 46:33.360
<i>and suddenly you have a police</i> <i>officer in front of you.</i>

46:33.400 --> 46:35.080
Don't move. Police!

46:35.120 --> 46:37.560
What do you do? This, perhaps.

46:50.960 --> 46:52.680
My guess is forensic examination

46:52.720 --> 46:56.040
will show yours and Aimee's fingerprints,

46:52.720 --> 46:56.040
traces of strychnine

46:56.080 --> 47:00.160
and quite possibly a drop of your own blood for good measure.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.480
When you returned to the boat yesterday,

47:01.520 --> 47:03.160
<i>you weren't coming back</i> <i>for your knives -</i>

47:03.200 --> 47:06.120
you were coming to retrieve this from its hiding place.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.760
But what about motive?

47:09.800 --> 47:12.000
Well, that was slightly harder to establish, but,

47:12.040 --> 47:14.360
well, once I knew you were the murderer,

47:14.400 --> 47:16.320
it was simply a case of working backwards.

47:16.360 --> 47:18.560
That, and a seemingly random event.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.640
A small-time criminal was caught trying to steal

47:20.680 --> 47:22.600
a crate of beer bottles from just on the harbour here,

47:22.640 --> 47:26.160
got very badly beaten up. Then I remembered seeing a beer bottle

47:26.200 --> 47:27.600
in the cupboard at Aimee's apartment.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.400
I remember wondering why it wasn't in the fridge.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.520
Dwayne? Behind the bar.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.600
Then it struck me.

47:35.640 --> 47:38.000
I knew where Aimee was hoping to get her 20,000 from.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.360
It was you, wasn't it?

47:40.400 --> 47:44.280
She was blackmailing you, because she'd discovered

47:40.400 --> 47:44.280
your little secret.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.600
You'd been using the party boat's movements

47:53.760 --> 47:56.600
from island to island

47:56.640 --> 47:58.320
to deliver drug shipments.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.280
Stupid bastard!

48:00.320 --> 48:01.720
Eloise told us you knew of her plan

48:01.760 --> 48:03.920
to put something in Aimee's gargle bottle.

48:03.960 --> 48:07.080
I mean, I even, I even asked Grant for

48:03.960 --> 48:07.080
something from the kitchen,

48:07.120 --> 48:10.080
a chilli maybe, but when he talked me out of it,

48:10.120 --> 48:11.880
<i>I, I used rosehip instead.</i>

48:11.920 --> 48:14.600
But you saw her, didn't you, and you put the poison

48:11.920 --> 48:14.600
in Aimee's bottle

48:14.640 --> 48:16.280
assuming Eloise would get the blame.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.880
<i>You watched and waited</i> <i>for Aimee to take</i>

48:17.880 --> 48:20.880
<i>the fatal dose.</i>

48:20.920 --> 48:23.320
<i>But just as Aimee was going to</i> <i>drink from her gargle bottle,</i>

48:23.360 --> 48:25.000
<i>she heard her music cue.</i>

48:26.160 --> 48:28.040
<i>Your plan went wrong</i>

48:28.080 --> 48:31.080
<i>when you saw she failed</i> <i>to drink from it and instead</i>

48:28.080 --> 48:31.080
<i>rushed onstage.</i>

48:31.120 --> 48:32.680
<i>So you quickly came up</i> <i>with plan B.</i>

48:34.320 --> 48:35.680
<i>You poured a shot of rum.</i>

48:40.640 --> 48:42.840
<i>And added a lethal measure</i> <i>of strychnine.</i>

48:46.280 --> 48:48.280
If Aimee had gargled from the bottle as you'd planned,

48:48.320 --> 48:51.480
I'm not sure we could have caught you. But she didn't,

48:51.520 --> 48:54.640
and you were forced into making a mistake.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.720
One that will send you to prison.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.560
Yeah, well, I don't think you can prove it.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.160
I do. Fidel!

49:10.400 --> 49:13.280
Unbeknownst to you, your every move was captured

49:13.320 --> 49:17.400
in the reflective surfaces of the party boat decorations.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.600
Take him away.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.400
Well, well.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.760
Evening, gentlemen.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.000
Flowers.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.600
For you. Orchids.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.000
Stephen may be unoriginal,

50:23.040 --> 50:25.320
but he has fairly good taste in floral arrangements.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.960
Why are you giving them to me?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.840
Because I don't really know how to say I'm sorry.

50:31.880 --> 50:33.280
For what happened to your friend.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.880
Oh, it doesn't matter. They weren't expensive.

50:37.920 --> 50:40.320
Richard. You found out why she died.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.200
Who was responsible.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.560
You've done enough already.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.040
So do you want me to take them back, or...

50:51.080 --> 50:53.280
Well, I, I didn't mean that.

50:56.200 --> 51:00.280
I'm sorry, too. About what I said before.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.280
About how you didn't have friends, because, you know,

51:00.320 --> 51:03.280
we are...

51:03.320 --> 51:06.040
I hope you're not going to say that you, Fidel and Dwayne

51:06.080 --> 51:09.000
are my friends because that would be

51:06.080 --> 51:09.000
horrifically sentimental

51:09.040 --> 51:10.320
and, and mawkish and...

51:12.520 --> 51:14.120
Join me?

51:20.040 --> 51:21.080
Jacket.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.800
They were quite expensive actually,

51:30.840 --> 51:33.720
ridiculous really when you consider
