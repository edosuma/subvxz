00:26.652 --> 00:29.612
For centuries,
our sisters of the Aes Sedai

00:29.696 --> 00:33.533
have sought to understand
the Breaking of the World.

00:35.536 --> 00:39.414
Three thousand years ago,
Lews Therin and the forces of Light

00:39.497 --> 00:41.959
struck the Dark One and sealed him away.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.756
Before he was imprisoned,

00:47.840 --> 00:50.801
the Dark One delivered
one last defiant strike.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.185
The Dark One poisoned the source of power
for male Aes Sedai.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.231
With this, Lews Therin lost his mind.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.155
He murdered his beloved wife.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.325
He slew his children she bore him.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.496
His friends, his court... everyone.

01:23.082 --> 01:26.128
The Dark One released Lews Therin
from his madness,

01:26.212 --> 01:28.296
just to show him what he had done.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.884
But it wasn't Lews Therin alone
who suffered.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.259
The poison spread.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.805
No male Aes Sedai was spared.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.474
And so began the Breaking.

01:43.145 --> 01:44.354
The time of madness.

01:49.359 --> 01:53.697
It was a time of unchecked, unhinged rage
that destroyed the world.

01:57.742 --> 02:01.831
They changed the face of the world
and ended the Age of Legends.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.043
Humanity is driven
to the brink of extinction.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.175
What few survivors remained

02:13.634 --> 02:16.846
are scattered across
a broken and unrecognizable land.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.602
The breaking lasts for over 100 years

02:23.686 --> 02:27.522
and ends only when the last
male channeler alive is gentled.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.110
By then,
entire civilizations had disappeared.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.990
Centuries of progress and knowledge, gone.

02:38.908 --> 02:43.038
The very lives we live today are shaped
by this immeasurable loss.

02:46.876 --> 02:49.295
For those of you destined
to take the shawl,

02:49.752 --> 02:53.299
it would be among the most
sacred of duties, as an Aes Sedai,

02:54.466 --> 02:57.468
to protect the world
from another such breaking.
