Last season on
Witches of East End...
BOTH: Mom!

00:03.609 --> 00:06.409
Girls, I want you
to meet your Aunt Wendy.

00:06.442 --> 00:08.042
Hi.
Freya...

00:08.075 --> 00:10.009
The girls don't
know what they are.

00:10.042 --> 00:12.909
I decided this life, for
once, they'd be normal.

00:12.942 --> 00:15.442
I need to tell you, it's the
truth about who we are.

00:15.475 --> 00:16.675
INGRID:
Please don't tell me...

00:16.709 --> 00:18.109
BOTH:
We're witches.

00:18.142 --> 00:21.242
All of our kind must abide,
we never reveal ourselves.

00:21.275 --> 00:22.909
What do you think the girls
are going to say

00:22.942 --> 00:25.275
when I tell them that you left
their brother behind?

00:25.309 --> 00:27.509
Victor!
It's really you.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.109
Who is this?
He's your father.

00:29.142 --> 00:31.009
Killian?
Well, I figured,
my big brother's

00:31.042 --> 00:32.175
getting married,
I should come congratulate him.

00:32.209 --> 00:33.942
I can't wait
to call you my wife.

00:33.975 --> 00:36.775
I'm in love with you.
I'm marrying Dash tomorrow.

00:36.809 --> 00:38.242
JOANNA:
One man is our soul mate,

00:38.275 --> 00:39.375
the other man's your destroyer.

00:39.409 --> 00:41.342
Killian left it.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.542
I can't marry you.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.609
Get out!
(Joanna screams)

PENELOPE:
The argenteum has
taken its toll.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.742
Dash isn't really your son?
Oh, he is.

00:48.775 --> 00:50.042
I just borrowed
(screams)

00:50.075 --> 00:51.542
his powers
when he was a baby.

Killian!

01:00.742 --> 01:02.375
Did she poison you
with argenteum?

01:02.409 --> 01:05.109
Yeah. I might not
have long left. (laughs)

01:05.142 --> 01:07.109
I want to know about Asgard.

01:07.142 --> 01:08.575
What happened there?

01:08.609 --> 01:10.175
There was a war...

01:10.209 --> 01:12.075
and we lost.

01:12.109 --> 01:15.542
If you could open the door
and go back... would you?

01:15.575 --> 01:17.309
I'd be pretty scared
to open that door.

son of a bitch.

05:45.242 --> 05:46.742
What did he look like?!
You saw him?!

05:46.775 --> 05:48.409
He's cloaking himself, somehow.

how did you do it?

07:01.809 --> 07:04.109

so maybe we should
try it first.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.875
Yeah.

well under control.

Thank you. I have been feeling

12:25.642 --> 12:28.442
collection of historic
documents relating to witchcraft

12:28.475 --> 12:31.609
in southern New England
from the 1650s to present day.

12:31.642 --> 12:34.609
So boring, but that
is perfect for you.

12:34.642 --> 12:36.175
Exactly, but there's a catch.

12:36.209 --> 12:38.342
They're only
interviewing PhDs.
So?

12:38.375 --> 12:39.942
So, I'm not one.

12:39.975 --> 12:43.442
But I called up the dean
of the history department

12:43.475 --> 12:44.875
anyway, and told him I was,

12:44.909 --> 12:46.275
and he's coming here
to interview me today.

12:46.309 --> 12:49.775
Great. So, what's the problem?
I lied to him.

12:49.809 --> 12:52.342
Please. It's a white lie.
I tell them all the time.

12:52.375 --> 12:54.075
It's like,

12:54.109 --> 12:55.509
I wasn't actually
stuck in traffic today.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.909
I just felt like sleeping in.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.342
And...

12:58.375 --> 13:00.509
you are so not
pulling off those earrings.

13:00.542 --> 13:02.542
I'm not comfortable with it.

13:02.575 --> 13:04.342
I think I'm just
gonna come clean.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.409
I can win this
job on merit.

13:06.442 --> 13:08.209
Besides, he'll respect
my initiative, right?

13:08.242 --> 13:10.775
Yeah.
Audaces fortuna iuvat.

13:12.409 --> 13:15.542
I don't know what that means.
Fortune favors the bold.

13:33.242 --> 13:35.242
(low growling)

13:42.709 --> 13:44.709
Mm.

13:44.742 --> 13:46.542
I must have
dozed off.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.842
I should go
make breakfast.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.375
That's okay. It's...

13:50.409 --> 13:51.909
Joanna, it's the afternoon.

13:51.942 --> 13:55.042
Victor, I told you not
to let me sleep all day!

13:55.075 --> 13:56.675
You're sick.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.675
It's okay to take it easy.
It's not okay.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.409
Someone came
through that portal.

14:00.442 --> 14:03.909
Wendy saw him
in the woods last night, and

14:03.942 --> 14:06.842
I should be out
protecting us.
Where are you going?

14:06.875 --> 14:11.042
Well, maybe... I can track
our visitor in the woods.

14:11.075 --> 14:12.675
Joanna, stop.

14:12.709 --> 14:15.942
(groans)
Just stop.

14:15.975 --> 14:17.609
(sighs)
You're bleeding.

14:17.642 --> 14:19.775
I'm fine.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.209
No. No, you're not fine.

14:21.242 --> 14:24.542
I know I'm not fine!

14:27.642 --> 14:30.042
(grunts)

14:30.075 --> 14:32.409
(crying)

14:33.809 --> 14:36.042
(crying):
I have never felt so helpless

14:36.075 --> 14:40.042
in my entire life,
and I hate it so much!

14:40.075 --> 14:43.175
I can't even cast a simple
spell anymore, let alone

14:43.209 --> 14:45.009
stand on my own two feet.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.442
(sighs)

14:46.475 --> 14:48.009
That's why you have us.

14:48.042 --> 14:50.375
(sighs)
To stand with you.

14:50.409 --> 14:52.009
I don't have you.

14:52.042 --> 14:54.409
Yes, you do.

14:56.109 --> 14:57.775
You have me, Joanna.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.942
As long as you want me,
I'm here.

15:12.109 --> 15:13.742
Hey, Frey. What's up?

15:13.775 --> 15:15.709
Wendy,

15:15.742 --> 15:17.075
I'm freaking out.
What's‐what's happened?

15:17.109 --> 15:18.842
Killian is dead.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.909
What?
You know that music box
he gave me?

15:20.942 --> 15:22.775
Well, I just opened it,
and I saw him.

15:22.809 --> 15:24.442
He was dead on the ground.

15:24.475 --> 15:26.242
Okay, honey, listen, it sounds
like you had a vision.

15:26.275 --> 15:27.675
You have a gift
for premonition,

15:27.709 --> 15:29.242
and your powers
are only getting stronger.

15:29.275 --> 15:31.509
Right, premonition.
So he might still be alive.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.942
Visions are tricky.
They're kind of like dreams.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.742
They can either be a metaphor,
or literal.

15:35.775 --> 15:38.209
Well, how am I supposed
to figure that out?!

15:38.242 --> 15:40.609
Don't worry, honey.
I will deal the deck tonight.

15:40.642 --> 15:42.575
Just stay where you are.
I'll be back soon.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.275
I had a really good idea
for a tea

15:44.309 --> 15:45.709
that might help
ease your mom's pain.

15:45.742 --> 15:47.375
I just have to grab a book.

15:47.409 --> 15:49.209
Okay.
Okay. Bye.

15:49.242 --> 15:51.042
Oh, there it is.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.909
Okay.
Oops. Sorry, buddy.
Yeah.

15:52.942 --> 15:54.375
I was here first, so, come back
next week when I return it.

15:54.409 --> 15:56.709
Actually, I was here first.

15:56.742 --> 15:58.242
You're just trying to
grab it out of my hand.

15:58.275 --> 16:00.542
Only 'cause
I really need it.
So do I.

16:00.575 --> 16:02.042
Oh, come on. Please?

16:02.075 --> 16:04.109
I'll owe you one.

16:04.142 --> 16:05.609
Mm. Nice try, but, no.

16:05.642 --> 16:10.109
The whole "Look at me,
I'm so cute. Now give me

16:10.142 --> 16:13.175
everything I want" thing doesn't
work with me. I'm immune.

16:13.209 --> 16:15.442
Excuse me for trying to appeal
to your sense of chivalry.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.709
You mean trying to manipulate
the situation by flirting

16:17.742 --> 16:20.242
with me.
Why exactly
do you need

16:20.275 --> 16:22.175
The Complete Encyclopedia
of Native North American

16:22.209 --> 16:23.742
Edible and Medicinal Herbs?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.375
Not that it's any
of your business,

16:25.409 --> 16:27.009
but I'm planting
an herb garden.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.875
Oh, please. You are so not
the herb garden type.

16:29.909 --> 16:32.575
Just go to the supermarket and
buy yourself some dried oregano

16:32.609 --> 16:35.009
and call it day.
(book thuds to floor)

16:35.042 --> 16:37.409
Oh, sorry. Too bad. I win.
(laughs)

16:37.442 --> 16:40.709
I don't think so.
Wait. Seriously, I need that.

16:40.742 --> 16:43.742
Well, you're in luck. There's
another copy right there.

16:45.742 --> 16:47.742
You should really
be more observant.

16:47.775 --> 16:49.175
So why'd you take mine?

16:49.209 --> 16:53.209
Because... I wanted to win.

16:58.709 --> 17:01.942
Yeah. It's the same one.

17:28.609 --> 17:32.209
Dash?

17:32.242 --> 17:35.209
You're not gonna figure
this out scientifically.

17:35.242 --> 17:36.742
What's happening to you

17:36.775 --> 17:40.709
is not scientific.

17:40.742 --> 17:44.375
You're not gonna find
the reason in an MRI.

17:44.409 --> 17:45.875
(whirring)

17:45.909 --> 17:47.575
What you should

17:47.609 --> 17:49.342
really be worried about is what
they're gonna do to you

17:49.375 --> 17:50.875
when they find my body!

18:04.409 --> 18:07.375
You see anything
in there?
No, but

18:07.409 --> 18:11.242
something tells me that that
vision was meant only for you.

18:11.275 --> 18:13.242
I've been trying to induce
another one all afternoon.

18:13.275 --> 18:14.875
Nothing.

18:14.909 --> 18:17.042
Trying to force magic just does
the opposite, Freya.

18:17.075 --> 18:19.242
Just relax, and clear your mind.

18:19.275 --> 18:20.842
I'm trying.
It's not working.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.542
You don't clear your mind
by trying.

18:22.575 --> 18:23.909
You clear it by letting go.

18:23.942 --> 18:25.242
Okay, Yodas.

18:25.275 --> 18:27.609
(laughter)
Can you just

18:27.642 --> 18:29.175
get the tarot cards
out now, please?

18:29.209 --> 18:30.775
Tonight, when the moon is up.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.342
Why does witchcraft have
to have so many rules?

18:33.375 --> 18:36.442
Hey, don't forget. It lets you
break a lot of rules, too.

18:36.475 --> 18:38.609
(laughter)

18:38.642 --> 18:41.075
My sentiments exactly.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.009
Oh.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.242
(laughter)

18:49.275 --> 18:51.275
Oh.

18:51.309 --> 18:53.042
Okay, that's
pretty cool.

18:53.075 --> 18:55.542
(laughter)
JOANNA:
Okay.

18:55.575 --> 18:58.275
I would like to make a toast.

18:58.309 --> 19:00.342
To our little family.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.442
(gasps)
Joanna? Joanna?
Mom?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.042
What's wrong?
Mom?

19:04.075 --> 19:06.375
Oh, it's just my head.
It's like...

19:06.409 --> 19:08.275
I...
Mom!

19:08.309 --> 19:10.109
Joanna!
(women screaming)

19:19.712 --> 19:20.597
VICTOR:
She had a seizure,

19:20.631 --> 19:22.231
which is normal
for her condition.

19:22.264 --> 19:24.531
I know it looks bad,
but she wants you

19:24.564 --> 19:26.264
to just keep going about
your normal business.

19:26.297 --> 19:27.731
You two staying here
and worrying

19:27.764 --> 19:29.864
is the last thing
your mother wants.

19:29.897 --> 19:32.064
She's gonna be okay.

19:32.097 --> 19:34.264
I promise.

19:34.297 --> 19:37.464
Okay.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.664
(sighs)
Good luck, Ingrid.
Break a leg.

19:48.597 --> 19:51.064
Why are you lying to them?

19:51.097 --> 19:52.531
Joanna asked me to.

19:52.564 --> 19:54.897
She doesn't want
them to worry.
(scoffs)

19:54.931 --> 19:58.531
But they should be worried,
shouldn't they? We all should.

19:58.564 --> 20:02.764
The argenteum is multiplying
in her blood, like cancer.

20:02.797 --> 20:04.931
It's infecting
her brain.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.464
Even if we continue
the treatments,

20:06.497 --> 20:07.964
I won't be able
to keep her alive much longer.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.631
There's got to be something
we can do.

20:10.664 --> 20:12.764
Yeah, but

20:12.797 --> 20:15.031
I've been researching
her condition.

20:15.064 --> 20:16.864
There's a plant
that grows in the Amazon.

20:16.897 --> 20:19.764
It's very rare, but
it may be a cure.

20:19.797 --> 20:21.197
It's a long shot,
but if I leave tonight,

20:21.231 --> 20:22.597
I can be back within three days.

20:22.631 --> 20:25.131
Three days?
Do she even have that long?

20:27.097 --> 20:29.331
Probably not,
but we have to try.

20:35.764 --> 20:37.964
Hi. Are you Mr. Foster?

20:37.997 --> 20:39.931
I'm so sorry I
kept you waiting.

20:39.964 --> 20:41.797
It's Dr. Foster, actually.

20:41.831 --> 20:44.931
I have a PhD in history,
as well as one in literature.

20:44.964 --> 20:47.797
Impressive.
I'm Ingrid Beauchamp, and I am

20:47.831 --> 20:49.931
so sorry I'm late. I'm
usually obsessively punctual.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.631
I had a family emergency.

20:51.664 --> 20:53.764
Really, that's
not an excuse.

20:53.797 --> 20:55.231
My mother's been quite ill.

20:55.264 --> 20:56.931
And my dog was euthanized today,

20:56.964 --> 20:58.297
but I managed to get here

20:58.331 --> 21:00.131
on time.

21:00.164 --> 21:02.031
I am so sorry.

21:02.064 --> 21:04.864
Why don't we just get started?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.131
Okay. Great.

21:07.164 --> 21:09.464
I've been reviewing
your résumé.

21:09.497 --> 21:12.364
It says here that you've only
completed a master's degree.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.064
Yes. Technically,

21:14.097 --> 21:15.897
I haven't quite finished
my doctoral dissertation yet,

21:15.931 --> 21:18.597
and I'm sorry if I didn't make
that clear on the phone.

21:18.631 --> 21:20.197
Actually, I believe

21:20.231 --> 21:22.464
your exact words were,
"I have a PhD in history."

21:22.497 --> 21:24.131
You're right.
I did say that.

21:24.164 --> 21:25.731
And I'm sorry I lied.

21:25.764 --> 21:27.364
I just wanted a fair shot,

21:27.397 --> 21:29.364
and I didn't think
you'd see me otherwise.

21:29.397 --> 21:30.797
And you'd be right.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.364
But I believe
you will come to find

21:33.397 --> 21:37.364
that there is no one else
in this town, this county,

21:37.397 --> 21:40.564
this state who is better
qualified for this job than me.

21:40.597 --> 21:42.964
Than I.
And with your consent,

21:42.997 --> 21:45.031
I‐I would love to share
my dissertation with you.

21:45.064 --> 21:47.097
And I would love
to read it

21:47.131 --> 21:49.297
as soon as it's completed.

21:51.064 --> 21:55.197
I think our time
is up, Ms. Beauchamp.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.731
Thank you, Dr. Foster.

21:59.231 --> 22:01.564
And I'm‐I'm sorry
about your dog.

22:04.431 --> 22:07.064
(sighs)

22:08.997 --> 22:11.431
(low growling)

22:27.231 --> 22:31.264
Sunla draeilí,

22:31.297 --> 22:35.297
Eitthmig oa íKlae á nyttvao.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.931
INGRID:
A week ago,

22:46.964 --> 22:50.197
I got shot. I found out
that I am the only person

22:50.231 --> 22:52.431
on Earth who can unlock
the door to Asgard.

22:52.464 --> 22:54.064
Me. I'm the key.

22:54.097 --> 22:55.764
I'm a badass witch.

22:55.797 --> 22:57.931
So why is everything
still so hard?

22:57.964 --> 23:00.331
Honey, you're asking
the wrong person.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.364
Hi.
Hey.

23:04.397 --> 23:05.931
I got your message.

23:05.964 --> 23:08.631
That guy sounds
like a total prick.

23:08.664 --> 23:10.431
Thank you for coming.

23:10.464 --> 23:11.931
You know what you should do?

23:11.964 --> 23:14.297
A spell. To get you the job.

23:14.331 --> 23:15.631
Like we did for Barb

23:15.664 --> 23:17.264
to get her pregnant.
That totally worked.

23:17.297 --> 23:19.431
I love that idea. Can I help?

23:19.464 --> 23:20.897
We're not doing a spell, Freya.

23:20.931 --> 23:22.597
There's no such thing as spells.

23:22.631 --> 23:24.697
Who cares?
Come on,
it'll be fun.
How about

23:24.731 --> 23:27.131
'cause it's wrong?
First of all, it's not wrong,

23:27.164 --> 23:28.364
because as you
just said, there's

23:28.397 --> 23:29.597
no such thing as magic.

23:29.631 --> 23:31.397
Secondly, a very wise woman

23:31.431 --> 23:34.231
once told me that witchcraft
lets you break the rules.

23:34.264 --> 23:36.897
I believe you're quoting
that woman out of context.

23:36.931 --> 23:38.297
Am I?

23:38.331 --> 23:40.764
We just need
to find a spell.

23:40.797 --> 23:42.497
Oh, I think we can
throw something together.

23:53.497 --> 23:56.231
Many more will die before
the right one is found.

23:56.264 --> 23:57.397
This is a warning
to us all.

23:57.431 --> 23:58.764
You!

23:58.797 --> 24:01.731
You're one of them.
I know what you are.

24:01.764 --> 24:03.297
(quick grunt)

24:07.097 --> 24:09.231
Code blue.
Beginning compressions.

24:22.931 --> 24:25.464
Dr. Gardiner, intubate.

24:25.497 --> 24:26.697
He's throwing multiple PVCs.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.631
DOCTOR:
150 milligrams, Amiodarone.

24:28.664 --> 24:30.464
Short runs
of bigeminy. V‐tach.

24:30.497 --> 24:31.531
Charge to 200.

24:31.564 --> 24:33.997
Charged.
Clear.

24:35.264 --> 24:37.231
Still V‐tach.

24:37.264 --> 24:39.531
Losing him.
Recharge.
Charged.

24:39.564 --> 24:41.564
Clear.

24:51.164 --> 24:54.364
And now we say the chant
we got from Google.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.931
And Ingrid drinks.

25:00.064 --> 25:02.564
Abrogare dampnum.

25:08.397 --> 25:10.497
(whoops)

25:12.997 --> 25:15.597
Yes, one more.
Drink up.

25:16.797 --> 25:18.764
Yes.
(whoops)

25:18.797 --> 25:20.964
(whoops)
(whoops)

25:20.997 --> 25:22.831
(whoops, laughs)
That's my girl.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.431
How do you feel?

25:25.464 --> 25:27.131
A little drunk,
but better.

25:27.164 --> 25:29.931
That's good.
Nice, girl.
(whoops)

25:29.964 --> 25:31.364
Hey, kids.
Hey.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.931
Finally.
Ready?

25:32.964 --> 25:34.064
Yes.
Let's do this.

25:35.831 --> 25:40.931
I love you.
(laughs)

25:40.964 --> 25:42.564
Hello?

25:42.597 --> 25:43.964
Yes, this is she.

25:43.997 --> 25:45.697
(whispers):
It's Dr. Foster.

25:45.731 --> 25:48.464
Yes, of course.

25:48.497 --> 25:51.097
Absolutely, right away.

25:51.131 --> 25:53.964
Thank you so much,
Dr. Foster.

25:53.997 --> 25:58.097
(exhales)
I got the job.

25:58.131 --> 25:59.531
I got the job.
You really

25:59.564 --> 26:01.031
are a witch.
Or maybe he just realized

26:01.064 --> 26:03.031
I'm totally qualified.

26:03.064 --> 26:05.597
Shh, I'm Googling
♪ I got the job ♪

26:05.631 --> 26:08.064
sex spells.

26:08.097 --> 26:09.831

(shrieks)

26:12.131 --> 26:14.297
Huh.
What?

26:14.331 --> 26:15.597
What does it say?
Patience,

26:15.631 --> 26:17.431
please.

26:17.464 --> 26:19.597
Okay.

26:19.631 --> 26:20.931
I see water.

26:20.964 --> 26:22.864
Is he in it?
No.

26:22.897 --> 26:24.597
But he was hurt. Gravely.
Looks like his

26:24.631 --> 26:25.897
boat was destroyed by a storm.

26:25.931 --> 26:27.597
But he survived.

26:27.631 --> 26:29.231
Yes.

26:29.264 --> 26:31.597
He's still hurt,
but he's on dry land.

26:31.631 --> 26:35.264
And

26:35.297 --> 26:36.731
he's taking money from people.

26:36.764 --> 26:38.231
A lot of money.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.797
What do you mean,
like he's stealing?

26:39.831 --> 26:42.597
I don't know. Our path
goes cold. Something's

26:42.631 --> 26:43.797
blocking us.

26:50.097 --> 26:51.564
The owl?

26:53.397 --> 26:54.564
It's a spirit animal.

26:54.597 --> 26:56.097
In Killian's darkest moment,

26:56.131 --> 26:58.631
when he was near death,
he was visited by the owl.

26:58.664 --> 27:01.097
It created a barrier
of protection around him.

27:01.131 --> 27:04.397
We can't penetrate it.
Not with the cards, anyway.
But he's alive.

27:04.431 --> 27:06.431
Yes.
And he's protected.
That's great.

27:06.464 --> 27:07.631
Well...
What?

27:07.664 --> 27:09.464
The owl is also a predator,
so it could

27:09.497 --> 27:11.197
be protecting him
in order to destroy him.

27:11.231 --> 27:12.631
It's hard to say.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.397
Freya. You might want
to come out here.

27:14.431 --> 27:15.631
It's your sister.

27:15.664 --> 27:17.964
What?
What?

27:17.997 --> 27:19.964
INGRID:
I'm fine,

27:19.997 --> 27:22.197
I just can't move my shoulder.

27:22.231 --> 27:23.597
What happened?
Oh, my God.

27:23.631 --> 27:25.264
Hi.
Are you okay?
Let me look at it.

27:25.297 --> 27:27.464
Ma'am, please don't touch her.

27:27.497 --> 27:29.364
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Oh.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.931
It's herb boy.
Look, can you

27:30.964 --> 27:32.197
please step aside, ma'am?
Yeah.

27:32.231 --> 27:34.197
Would you stop
calling me ma'am?

27:34.231 --> 27:36.597
Who do you think you are?
A licensed EMT who was

27:36.631 --> 27:39.264
called to the scene to deal
with this situation.
Ingrid, what happened?

27:39.297 --> 27:41.531
I fell, but I'm fine.
Oh, see? She's fine.

27:41.564 --> 27:43.864
No, she's not fine. Look,
you have a dislocated shoulder.

27:43.897 --> 27:45.597
I'm gonna put it
back into place.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.964
The hell you are.
No...

27:48.231 --> 27:50.031
Sana...
Ma'am...

27:50.064 --> 27:51.431
What... Are you
massaging her?

27:51.464 --> 27:52.597
Please stop,
immediately.

27:52.631 --> 27:54.031
Okay, I'm... done.

27:54.064 --> 27:57.931
Whoa. This is so strange,
but I feel better.

27:57.964 --> 28:00.064
What the hell?
Oh, see?
Let's get you up.

28:00.097 --> 28:01.597
Quite the misdiagnosis
on your part.

28:01.631 --> 28:03.864
No, listen,
you need an X‐ray.

28:03.897 --> 28:05.531
No, she doesn't.
She says she's fine.

28:05.564 --> 28:07.064
She's fine.

28:07.097 --> 28:09.197
Okay, fine.
Then who's in charge here?

28:09.231 --> 28:11.797
I am.

28:11.831 --> 28:13.797
(giggling)
All right,
let's get you home.

28:13.831 --> 28:16.264
No, I want to stay.
I'm actually having fun.

28:16.297 --> 28:19.964
You're drunk.
So what? I'm sorry
if that bothers you,

28:19.997 --> 28:22.031
but I can't just
be your anchor, Wendy.

28:22.064 --> 28:23.697
I've changed,

28:23.731 --> 28:26.364
and I need to figure out
who I am, for me.

28:26.397 --> 28:27.864
(sighs)
EMT:
Okay, all right.

28:27.897 --> 28:29.531
can you please
sign below?

28:29.564 --> 28:31.564
Absolutely.

28:33.664 --> 28:35.131
It's nice to see you again.

28:35.164 --> 28:36.497
Ma'am.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.064
What was that about?

28:42.097 --> 28:43.597
It's a long story.

28:43.631 --> 28:45.231
Mm.
Mm.

28:47.231 --> 28:49.364
Ooh.

28:49.397 --> 28:50.897
FREYA:
Oh.

28:50.931 --> 28:53.164
God, he's never
looked at me like that.

28:55.231 --> 28:58.731
His aura is so
dark and angry.

28:58.764 --> 29:00.764
Yeah, I see it, too.

29:06.897 --> 29:10.031
You want to go
somewhere else?

29:10.064 --> 29:12.631
You kidding?
I love it here.

29:21.264 --> 29:22.731
This is Dr. Gardiner.

29:22.764 --> 29:24.031
Dr. Gardiner,
this is Dr. Carlyle.

29:24.064 --> 29:26.431
I got the MRI scan you asked me

29:26.464 --> 29:28.131
to take a look at earlier.

29:28.164 --> 29:29.764
And have you found anything?

29:29.797 --> 29:33.131
No obvious pathology.
But there are certain gross

29:33.164 --> 29:35.031
structural abnormalities.

29:35.064 --> 29:37.197
I cross‐referenced the scan

29:37.231 --> 29:39.631
against hospital records
for the last 20 years

29:39.664 --> 29:41.964
and, believe it or not,
I found a match.

29:41.997 --> 29:43.964
What do you mean, a match?

29:43.997 --> 29:47.464
In 1994, a ten‐year‐old girl

29:47.497 --> 29:49.431
fell off a jungle gym
at East End elementary

29:49.464 --> 29:52.097
and got a concussion.
She came in for an MRI.

29:52.131 --> 29:54.931
It turns out her brain structure
was completely unique.

29:54.964 --> 29:56.231
Well, not completely.

29:56.264 --> 29:57.897
It was exactly like

29:57.931 --> 29:59.631
the patient I'm looking at now.

29:59.664 --> 30:00.964
You know what, I‐I'd like
to do a follow‐up.

30:00.997 --> 30:03.297
Can you give me her name?

30:03.331 --> 30:05.997
Ingrid Beauchamp.

30:08.064 --> 30:10.064
...to protect you.

30:20.231 --> 30:22.297
What are you doing?

30:28.297 --> 30:30.564
This is for Freya.

30:30.597 --> 30:32.731
She gave it to me...
Well, (short laugh)

30:32.764 --> 30:34.564
an earlier version of her did.

30:34.597 --> 30:36.197
In Los Angeles.

30:36.231 --> 30:40.231
Long time ago. And I'd like her
to have it again.

30:40.264 --> 30:43.264
This...

30:43.297 --> 30:46.997
is for Ingrid,
because she always loved it.

30:48.331 --> 30:50.864
And this

30:50.897 --> 30:52.897
is for you.

30:55.631 --> 30:57.464
Stop it.

30:57.497 --> 30:59.264
We're going
upstairs.

30:59.297 --> 31:00.631
It's time for your treatment.

31:02.431 --> 31:05.064
The treatments
aren't working anymore.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.697
They make me foggy

31:06.731 --> 31:10.397
and tired,
and they hurt like hell.

31:16.097 --> 31:17.764
I'm done.

31:17.797 --> 31:19.631
The only reason
I've been holding on all week

31:19.664 --> 31:20.931
is because
of the girls.

31:20.964 --> 31:22.431
Because
I knew that

31:22.464 --> 31:25.364
if I die, then they can
never be reborn.

31:25.397 --> 31:28.197
But I realized
something tonight.

31:28.231 --> 31:30.264
Um...

31:35.964 --> 31:38.564
All I've ever wanted
for my girls

31:38.597 --> 31:41.531
was that they
get to lead a normal life.

31:41.564 --> 31:45.031
(softly):
I know.

31:45.064 --> 31:48.397
This is normal.

31:48.431 --> 31:50.564
I'm not supposed
to live forever.

31:50.597 --> 31:52.631
And maybe if I go,

31:52.664 --> 31:54.731
my curse goes with me.

31:54.764 --> 31:57.431
And my girls
will finally

31:57.464 --> 32:00.131
get to grow old,
for once.

32:02.131 --> 32:04.731
There is no way in hell

32:04.764 --> 32:06.797
I'm gonna let you die.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.931
Whether you let me or not,

32:13.964 --> 32:15.297
it's happening.

32:15.331 --> 32:16.797
No.

32:16.831 --> 32:18.431
I'm ready to go.

32:18.464 --> 32:19.797
No.

32:19.831 --> 32:21.864
I'm at peace, Wendy.

32:21.897 --> 32:24.797
I promise.

32:26.264 --> 32:29.131
You have no idea
how much you mean to me.

32:30.964 --> 32:33.297
Yes, I do.
No.

32:33.331 --> 32:35.331
Yes, I do.

32:44.164 --> 32:46.364
Can I have
Ingrid's ring instead?

32:46.397 --> 32:49.431
No.
(knocking)

32:50.564 --> 32:52.564
I'm gonna get it.

33:02.264 --> 33:04.264
(knocking)

33:24.231 --> 33:26.364
Frederick.

33:26.397 --> 33:28.597
Mom.

33:46.597 --> 33:48.297
It's cold here.

33:48.331 --> 33:49.797
I'm not used to it.

33:49.831 --> 33:51.197
Where have you been?

33:51.231 --> 33:53.697
The portal was opened
over a week ago.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.897
Something happened
when I went through.

33:55.931 --> 33:58.064
My memory was erased.

33:58.097 --> 34:00.764
I've been wandering
around in a daze.

34:00.797 --> 34:03.797
I only just remembered
where I am,

34:03.831 --> 34:06.131
who I am.

34:07.597 --> 34:09.897
I'm just lucky
that I found you,

34:09.931 --> 34:11.531
and you're all still alive.

34:11.564 --> 34:13.197
I saw you
in the woods last night.

34:13.231 --> 34:15.097
Well, you saw
something.

34:15.131 --> 34:16.764
I mean, we don't

34:16.797 --> 34:18.164
know that it was Frederick.

34:19.731 --> 34:23.231
Did anyone or,
uh... or anything

34:23.264 --> 34:25.097
come through the
portal with you?

34:25.131 --> 34:26.797
It's possible.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.631
Yeah, I can't...
I can't remember.

34:28.664 --> 34:30.931
There were definitely others
who would have.

34:30.964 --> 34:34.231
Well, that must be what it is.
Someone else came through.

34:34.264 --> 34:36.464
It would account for
all of our memory loss.

34:36.497 --> 34:38.397
We're all under the same spell.

34:38.431 --> 34:40.264
Or one of us is lying.

34:43.264 --> 34:46.097
I'm just lucky
I got out of Asgard alive.

34:46.131 --> 34:49.097
It's descended
into chaos.

34:49.131 --> 34:51.964
I can't describe it.

34:53.631 --> 34:56.531
I've been trying to escape
for hundreds of years.

34:56.564 --> 34:59.464
Just dreaming of the day
that I'd see you all again.

35:01.764 --> 35:04.497
I can't believe
you're really here.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.064
I don't trust him.

35:08.097 --> 35:09.897
Not one bit.
You shouldn't, either.

35:09.931 --> 35:11.697
Last time
that we saw him...

35:11.731 --> 35:13.531
Was a long time
ago, and he's...

35:13.564 --> 35:15.264
Obviously, he's been
through a lot since then.

35:15.297 --> 35:18.597
Or he wants us to think he has
so that we let down our guard.

35:18.631 --> 35:21.264
Joanna, I know
where you're coming from.

35:21.297 --> 35:24.097
I loved him once, too.
I miss him all the time.

35:24.131 --> 35:27.431
But the old Frederick
is gone now.
But you heard
what he said.

35:27.464 --> 35:30.431
He escaped Asgard
and our father.

35:30.464 --> 35:33.764
Who, let's not forget, he
aligned himself with against us!

35:33.797 --> 35:37.264
He betrayed us once, Joanna.
We can never trust him.

35:37.297 --> 35:39.131
Sorry.

35:39.164 --> 35:40.864
No, it's fine.

35:40.897 --> 35:42.131
Do you need
anything?

35:42.164 --> 35:43.597
You hungry?

35:43.631 --> 35:45.297
You're sick.

35:50.164 --> 35:51.731
Argenteum?

35:51.764 --> 35:53.531
Yes.

35:53.564 --> 35:55.464
I can help you.

loudly and deeply)

36:18.764 --> 36:20.764
The poison is in me now.

36:20.797 --> 36:22.797
What?!
It can't hurt me.

36:22.831 --> 36:24.797
I've spent the last century
building up my immunity.

36:24.831 --> 36:29.331
Grandfather tried to kill me
with argenteum more than once.

36:31.097 --> 36:34.464
I need to sleep.

36:34.497 --> 36:36.897
Now.

36:36.931 --> 36:38.464
(panting)
Oh.

36:42.564 --> 36:43.664
Good night.
Good night.

36:50.831 --> 36:52.364
Dash, wait. Can I talk to you?

36:52.397 --> 36:54.097
What do you want, Freya?
I just wanted

36:54.131 --> 36:55.764
to say that I'm sorry.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.797
I think about you
all the time.

36:57.831 --> 36:59.731
I feel awful
that I hurt you...

36:59.764 --> 37:01.131
I don't really care, Freya.

37:01.164 --> 37:02.564
Okay, okay,
look, I get it.

37:02.597 --> 37:03.931
I don't blame you.
I just...

37:03.964 --> 37:05.864
Oh, God, this is the worst,

37:05.897 --> 37:07.797
most awful thing
I could ever ask you,

37:07.831 --> 37:09.731
but I'm worried about Killian.

37:09.764 --> 37:12.797
I think he could be hurt, and
I was wondering if you had...

37:12.831 --> 37:14.464
Wow. You have
got some nerve.

37:14.497 --> 37:16.631
I'm sorry.

37:16.664 --> 37:21.564
Stay... the hell
away from me,

37:21.597 --> 37:26.264
or I promise you you
will regret it, Freya.

37:58.431 --> 37:59.897

you could have that?

No, I'll take it.

38:08.997 --> 38:11.031
You can take my room.
It's your house.

38:11.064 --> 38:14.464
It's our house,
and I don't mind.

38:14.497 --> 38:16.897
I mean, I don't think
I'm gonna sleep anyway.

38:16.931 --> 38:18.564
I feel incredible.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.464
I'm alive.
I feel reborn.

38:28.997 --> 38:32.597
Joanna, I know that this is
gonna be hard for you to hear.

emotional right now.

What? Does he know?

I don't think so,

We have to figure out how much
he knows, and go from there.

You saw the way
he looked at me, Wendy.
