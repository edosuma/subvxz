WEBVTT

00:14.788 --> 00:16.091
Aw, fuck.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.068
Ah, shit.

00:31.071 --> 00:33.575
Mr. P, I don't think
you wanna see this.

00:33.674 --> 00:34.942
Okay?

02:57.784 --> 02:59.220
This is Max.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.657
<i>Yo, Max,
it's Seth. We need to talk.</i>

03:02.756 --> 03:04.325
What's this about?

03:04.425 --> 03:05.745
<i>I'd rather
not say over the phone,</i>

03:05.826 --> 03:06.994
<i>we got to meet in person.</i>

03:07.095 --> 03:09.497
Sure, where do you wanna meet?

04:09.056 --> 04:12.493
Maximillian.

04:12.593 --> 04:13.494
Seth.

04:13.594 --> 04:14.729
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.

04:14.828 --> 04:16.997
This is a friendly meeting,
all right?

04:17.098 --> 04:20.335
How many poor souls, buried
out here, bought that line?

04:20.435 --> 04:25.239
Aw, you got a point there.
Look, put the gun down.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.074
Put it away.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.942
Wha...? You wanna frisk me?

04:29.042 --> 04:31.945
Is that it, huh?
You wanna piece of me?

04:32.045 --> 04:34.315
There you go.
I know you want it.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.958
So why am I out here
in the middle of nowhere?

04:45.058 --> 04:48.329
First of all,
before we go any further.

04:49.731 --> 04:51.399
What in the fuck is that?

04:51.499 --> 04:52.633
What? My prius?

04:53.735 --> 04:55.770
Yeah, your... your prius.

04:55.869 --> 04:57.271
It's my new g-ride.

04:58.473 --> 05:03.177
Yeah. My grandmother,
grandmother has the same model.

05:03.277 --> 05:05.011
Yeah, well. What can I say?

05:05.113 --> 05:07.582
I'm socially and economically
responsible.

05:12.820 --> 05:13.855
That's good.

05:13.954 --> 05:15.021
Oh, that's good.

05:15.123 --> 05:17.023
A gangster with a prius.
Oh, shit.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.526
Actually, that's brilliant.

05:19.627 --> 05:21.061
What's this about?

05:24.232 --> 05:27.635
It's about your fuckin'
brother, alright?

05:27.735 --> 05:30.338
He did it this time.
He fucked up.

05:30.438 --> 05:33.374
You gotta keep that kid
on a leash, Max.

05:33.474 --> 05:36.644
Now look, I'm comin' to you
because I respect you.

05:36.744 --> 05:38.613
I appreciate it.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.214
How bad?

05:40.314 --> 05:41.315
Bad.

05:41.416 --> 05:43.618
I got the contract,
late last night.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.154
Why the fuck is there
a contract on my kid brother?

05:46.254 --> 05:49.557
'Cause he's fucking
the wrong missus. That's why.

05:49.657 --> 05:51.092
Mr. Pinero wants it done.

05:51.192 --> 05:53.494
And that's it.
There's no takin' that back.

05:53.594 --> 05:55.129
And you know it.

05:55.229 --> 05:58.466
Jesus fucking Christ.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.966
Now, look,

06:00.066 --> 06:01.502
I can play dumb
for a couple of days

06:01.602 --> 06:04.439
but that's about it.
Then I gotta go after him.

06:04.539 --> 06:06.507
I understand.

06:06.607 --> 06:08.074
Any idea where he's at?

06:08.176 --> 06:09.644
Yeah, he's around.

06:09.744 --> 06:13.281
But I wanted you to hear it
from me first, Max. Alright?

06:13.381 --> 06:15.650
Now, when you find him,
just remember,

06:15.750 --> 06:17.385
you got a couple of days.

06:17.485 --> 06:20.087
Hopefully, you'll do
the right thing.

06:22.824 --> 06:27.495
If not, then. We're gonna
have to draw on each other.

06:29.330 --> 06:31.766
Let's hope
it doesn't come to that.

06:31.866 --> 06:33.901
Only if you help the kid out.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.636
If not, this is easy.

06:35.736 --> 06:37.305
He's my kid brother.

06:37.405 --> 06:40.274
Understand. I figured
you'd feel that way.

06:40.374 --> 06:42.143
I just needed to mention it.

06:43.711 --> 06:44.946
Where's he at?

08:55.977 --> 08:57.387
<i>Can't you read the sign?
I do not want to be...</i>

08:57.411 --> 08:58.571
Vince, it's your brother Max.

08:58.613 --> 08:59.680
Open up!

09:02.383 --> 09:04.719
I can't help you
if you don't open the door.

09:25.539 --> 09:27.942
How'd you know I was here?

09:28.042 --> 09:29.644
Seth called me.

09:40.187 --> 09:42.256
What do you plan
on doing with that gun?

09:45.660 --> 09:46.727
Vince!

09:46.827 --> 09:48.796
It's for protection!
What the fuck do you think?

09:48.896 --> 09:50.898
All right, relax, Vince.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.233
I'm here to help.

09:55.336 --> 09:57.872
I shouldn't trust anyone
right about now, you know.

09:57.972 --> 10:02.009
Vince, I'm your brother.
I said it was fine.

10:02.110 --> 10:04.478
How bad is it?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.882
It's bad.

10:09.383 --> 10:11.519
They rushed her
to the emergency room.

10:13.121 --> 10:14.989
She didn't make it.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.359
Why don't you give me that gun?

10:18.459 --> 10:19.894
Housekeeping.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.662
N-No, we're fine. Thank you.

10:21.762 --> 10:24.031
Jesus! Can't they read
the fucking sign?

10:24.132 --> 10:25.199
Do not disturb!

10:25.299 --> 10:28.335
What is so hard to
understand about that?

10:28.436 --> 10:30.638
- Fuck!
- Give me that gun.

10:30.738 --> 10:31.405
Vince!

10:31.505 --> 10:32.940
Fuck, Max! I need that!

10:33.040 --> 10:36.310
You don't know what you need!
You're out of fucking control!

10:36.410 --> 10:37.978
Wavin' this gun around.

10:38.080 --> 10:41.916
You're liable to
shoot yourself, or me!

10:56.397 --> 10:59.233
Oh my god. Oh my god.

11:00.367 --> 11:01.802
I'm covered in blood.

11:03.070 --> 11:06.974
Man, how long
have you been here?

11:07.074 --> 11:09.543
Um. I don't know.

11:09.643 --> 11:12.580
It was, five o'clock last night.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.682
And you still haven't
cleaned yourself up?

11:19.587 --> 11:21.021
Who else knows I'm here?

11:21.123 --> 11:24.058
It doesn't matter. Seth knows.

11:24.159 --> 11:25.593
He tipped me off where you were.

11:25.693 --> 11:27.695
There a contract out on me?

11:27.795 --> 11:29.830
Seth's got it.

11:29.930 --> 11:32.633
Shit.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.034
He comin'?

11:35.436 --> 11:37.705
Yeah, he'll be comin'.

11:37.805 --> 11:40.441
But as a courtesy to me,
he gave us two days.

11:40.541 --> 11:43.644
I see. Well, that is just
fuckin' nice of him, ain't it?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.479
I'll find
that piece of shit first.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.290
And what are you gonna do
when you catch up with him?

11:47.314 --> 11:49.350
- Kill him.
- Shut your mouth.

11:49.450 --> 11:51.619
You kill Seth,
they'll just send somebody else,

11:51.719 --> 11:54.021
and they'll keep comin'
until you're dead.

12:07.601 --> 12:11.372
Max, you gotta believe me, Max.
I didn't mean to do it.

12:11.472 --> 12:14.775
I didn't mean
to fucking kill her, Max.

12:14.875 --> 12:15.943
I know, Vince.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.414
I know.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.021
You want to tell me
what happened?

12:31.259 --> 12:32.893
I don't know. It's...

12:34.361 --> 12:37.098
It's just.
Somethin' took over me.

12:37.199 --> 12:41.368
It was just.
She blindsided me, man.

12:41.468 --> 12:42.870
Come here.

12:43.871 --> 12:46.274
You were fucking
gino pinero's wife?

12:46.373 --> 12:48.642
Not fucking. We were in love.

12:48.742 --> 12:51.412
Yeah, I'll bet ya,
it was wonderful.

12:51.512 --> 12:54.448
Fuck you. Don't do that, Max.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.117
When did this start?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.721
'Bout two months ago.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.456
Jesus Christ.

13:27.448 --> 13:28.959
Yo, so this was
the other night, right?

13:28.983 --> 13:31.452
I'm telling you, this broad
is like smokin',

13:31.552 --> 13:33.188
just unbelievable, you know.

13:33.288 --> 13:36.191
So, I get her
back to my place and.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.726
The body on this broad is like.

13:38.826 --> 13:40.628
Goddess, right?

13:40.728 --> 13:42.897
But. Here's the thing.

13:42.997 --> 13:45.766
I went out for Chinese food
that night before I hit the club

13:45.866 --> 13:48.203
and that shit put a real
monkey wrench in my plans.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.938
See, I got this, like, um,

13:51.038 --> 13:52.107
spicy szechwan chicken,

13:52.207 --> 13:54.608
just like, workin' its way
through my stomach.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.577
I got bubble guts
to the ninth degree.

13:56.677 --> 13:58.612
You know, never before
in my life

13:58.712 --> 14:00.047
has anything happened like this.

14:00.148 --> 14:02.583
You know, on the one hand,
I got a ragin' fuckin' hard on.

14:02.683 --> 14:04.652
And on the other hand,
I gotta take a sh.

14:08.356 --> 14:09.523
- Vince?
- What?

14:09.623 --> 14:11.192
You're not even listenin' to me.

14:11.293 --> 14:12.459
Yeah, I am.

14:12.559 --> 14:13.870
Dude, you're talkin' about
a smokin' hot broad.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.963
Smokin' hot broad?
That's all you heard?

14:17.232 --> 14:18.632
You fucked her, right?

14:18.732 --> 14:20.852
You didn't even hear about
the spicy szechwan chicken.

14:20.935 --> 14:24.438
What? What the fuck?

14:24.538 --> 14:28.542
Spicy szechwan chicken?
You're fucking crazy, dude.

14:28.642 --> 14:29.642
Fucking crazy.

14:29.710 --> 14:31.512
All right,
never mind, all right.

14:31.612 --> 14:33.847
What's got you
so fucking preoccupied?

14:36.117 --> 14:38.552
Yo, are you fucking nuts?
You're gonna get us both killed.

14:38.652 --> 14:40.088
I'm not doin' nothin'.

14:41.389 --> 14:42.656
That's gino pinero over there.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.159
Yeah, I know who he is.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.127
You know that's the guy's
fucking wife, right?

14:47.561 --> 14:48.963
Who?

14:49.063 --> 14:50.165
Who?

14:50.265 --> 14:52.766
The unbelievable smoking hot
blonde, sittin' over there

14:52.866 --> 14:54.010
- making eyes at you.
- So what?

14:54.034 --> 14:55.212
- .You making eyes back at her.
- So what?

14:55.236 --> 14:56.137
Man, just look away.

14:56.237 --> 14:58.373
Get the fuck off me.

14:58.472 --> 15:00.975
For god sakes, man,
just look away.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.685
Yeah, I'm tellin' you, man.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.688
I did not make the first move.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.092
You know, I could kill you
for bein' so stupid.

15:17.192 --> 15:20.295
Do you know you could have
gotten me killed, doin' that?

15:20.395 --> 15:22.563
It's got nothin'
to do with you, Max.

15:22.663 --> 15:24.165
You stupid fuck!

15:24.265 --> 15:26.101
I work for pinero.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.136
The only thing in life
he loved more than money

15:28.236 --> 15:29.404
was that woman.

15:29.503 --> 15:30.771
She was his prized possession.

15:30.871 --> 15:33.241
Yeah. Obviously,
the feeling wasn't mutual.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.043
What was I supposed to do?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.544
Find another floozy!

15:37.644 --> 15:39.713
There's a million
fucking broads in la

15:39.813 --> 15:42.049
and you gotta pick the one
that's gonna get you killed.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.754
I couldn't help myself.

15:46.854 --> 15:48.456
Excuse me.

15:48.555 --> 15:49.857
Can you hand me a match?

15:54.528 --> 15:55.863
Here you are, ma'am.

15:56.930 --> 16:00.667
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.

16:06.207 --> 16:08.942
Vince. I'm Vince.

16:10.577 --> 16:11.912
You smoke?

16:12.813 --> 16:14.681
Nah, we don't smoke.

16:18.153 --> 16:20.188
I could start.

16:20.288 --> 16:21.288
You mind?

16:22.323 --> 16:23.590
Let's go for a smoke.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.027
Sure.

16:33.734 --> 16:37.539
Great, the cock-blockin' friend.

16:37.638 --> 16:39.340
So you're gonna pay
for your tab this time?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.710
The fuck you talkin' about?
I always pay my tab.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.126
You know, my friend's
got my wallet.

16:49.150 --> 16:52.487
And when he comes back,
pay the tab.

16:52.586 --> 16:53.954
Okay.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.125
You guys doing okay?

17:02.330 --> 17:04.265
It really happen like that?

17:04.365 --> 17:05.266
Yeah, i'm...

17:05.366 --> 17:07.102
I'm tellin' you, man.

17:07.202 --> 17:10.405
She was just so,
so strong and forward.

17:10.505 --> 17:13.541
I mean, who was I to say no?

17:13.640 --> 17:14.908
You know, for once in your life,

17:15.008 --> 17:17.512
you should have listened
to that dipshit friend of yours.

17:17.611 --> 17:20.148
Bobby. What does he know?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.082
Absolutely nothin'.

17:21.182 --> 17:22.582
But he had the sense
enough to know,

17:22.616 --> 17:24.918
you stay away
from pinero's wife.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.854
It... it was like
this magnetic pull.

17:26.954 --> 17:29.357
I just... I couldn't turn away.

17:38.899 --> 17:40.301
So what's the plan?

17:42.370 --> 17:45.739
I don't know.
We gotta weigh our options here.

17:45.839 --> 17:49.042
We make a false move
and that's it, we're done.

17:49.144 --> 17:52.413
I'd rather not
travel by daylight.

17:52.514 --> 17:54.449
We gotta get you out of town.

17:54.549 --> 17:55.916
I'll gonna make some calls,

17:56.016 --> 17:58.253
see if there's a place
we can hide you out,

17:58.353 --> 18:00.288
lay low as long as possible.

18:03.191 --> 18:05.726
You don't have to
do this, you know?

18:05.826 --> 18:07.629
What are you talkin' about?

18:07.761 --> 18:10.063
You can take off
anytime you want.

18:10.165 --> 18:11.485
Yeah, and leave you here
all alone

18:11.533 --> 18:12.733
to figure this thing out?

18:12.833 --> 18:15.637
I know you're stickin'
your neck out here for me.

18:15.736 --> 18:18.306
And that's just
what I'm gonna do.

18:18.406 --> 18:21.176
I'm here until we get you
outta this thing.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.286
I'm as good as dead, aren't I?

18:33.720 --> 18:35.423
Not if I can help it.

18:36.890 --> 18:38.725
You're my kid brother.

18:40.562 --> 18:42.397
I'm here until
we get you out of this.

18:44.898 --> 18:48.835
Uh, who else is comin' for me?

18:50.003 --> 18:53.308
As far as I know, just Seth,
he's got the contract.

18:53.408 --> 18:55.909
But he says he's gonna
give us two days.

18:59.247 --> 19:00.348
You trust him?

19:00.448 --> 19:01.782
Yeah, I don't see why not.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.518
Yeah, I know.

19:04.586 --> 19:06.387
But what the fuck else
we gonna do?

19:17.798 --> 19:19.300
Thanks.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.767
Yeah.

19:23.971 --> 19:26.807
I've seen you here before.

19:26.907 --> 19:29.277
You remind me of someone
my husband knows.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.316
Yeah, it's. Um.

19:35.416 --> 19:36.584
Probably my brother, Max.

19:36.684 --> 19:38.319
He does some work
for your husband.

19:42.357 --> 19:43.424
You know my brother?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.528
You're not smoking.

19:47.629 --> 19:49.796
Hmm. Yeah, I don't smoke.

19:49.896 --> 19:53.668
Hmm, right.
Your boyfriend said that.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.203
My boyfriend?

19:55.303 --> 19:59.240
Relax. It's just a joke.

20:02.310 --> 20:03.844
Oh, that's, um.

20:03.944 --> 20:07.582
Funny sense of humor
you got there.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.983
You.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.020
Like my. Sense of humor?

20:18.792 --> 20:21.763
Jesus, lady.
Are you fucking nuts?

20:21.862 --> 20:24.165
We're alone.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.433
And besides.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.569
I won't tell if you don't.

20:33.474 --> 20:35.942
Wow.

20:37.679 --> 20:39.913
Who are you?

21:04.572 --> 21:06.274
And with that, I was hooked.

21:07.275 --> 21:11.079
She became an addiction,
you know.

21:11.179 --> 21:13.181
Yeah, I know the type.

21:14.415 --> 21:18.453
I know it may not seem like it,
but I've been there before.

21:18.553 --> 21:20.388
Who?

21:20.488 --> 21:21.656
Forget about it.

21:21.756 --> 21:23.324
No, really.

21:23.424 --> 21:25.926
Tell me, I mean, you always
seem all business and no fun.

21:26.026 --> 21:28.363
I mean, I'd like to
hear about her.

21:28.463 --> 21:30.398
Yeah, well, I was smart
and I broke it off

21:30.498 --> 21:33.601
before I did somethin' stupid.
Unlike you.

21:35.068 --> 21:37.271
Then she must not have
meant that much to you.

21:37.372 --> 21:39.039
You don't know
what you're talking about.

21:39.140 --> 21:41.476
Then tell me about her.

21:41.576 --> 21:44.345
I bet you, she wasn't
as hot as Laurel.

21:44.445 --> 21:45.346
Better.

21:45.446 --> 21:47.849
Bullshit! I always got
hotter women than you.

21:47.948 --> 21:48.850
Says who?

21:48.949 --> 21:50.218
Oh, come on, you know I did.

21:50.318 --> 21:52.196
I mean, you want to run
your list alongside mine,

21:52.220 --> 21:53.920
see who comes out ahead?

21:54.020 --> 21:54.888
Denise levine.

21:54.988 --> 21:55.989
Melissa rios.

21:56.090 --> 21:57.258
Sara corbett.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.358
Juliet tebbs.

21:58.393 --> 21:59.633
Amy hahn. My... my list is long,

21:59.660 --> 22:01.462
you're gonna start
running out of names, pal.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.930
Viv. Viv...

22:04.030 --> 22:05.442
I don't know
what viv's last name is.

22:05.466 --> 22:07.201
Then it doesn't count.

22:07.301 --> 22:09.570
Oh, fuck you, she was special.

22:09.670 --> 22:10.705
Oh, yeah, so special

22:10.805 --> 22:11.881
you don't even remember
her name, right?

22:11.905 --> 22:13.174
Leslie celso.

22:14.242 --> 22:15.443
What?

22:15.543 --> 22:17.278
She looked like a dude.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.546
What?

22:18.646 --> 22:21.215
A lil' dude-ish.

22:21.315 --> 22:22.383
Fuck you.

22:29.090 --> 22:30.625
Who is it?

22:30.725 --> 22:32.260
Fuckin' Bobby.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.729
Don't tell that creep
where you're at.

22:34.829 --> 22:36.062
He gets a hold of that info

22:36.164 --> 22:38.800
and everybody in town's
gonna know where you're at.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.168
He's not a creep.

22:40.268 --> 22:42.437
He's a fuckin' cretin.

22:42.537 --> 22:44.181
I don't even know
why you hang out with that guy

22:44.205 --> 22:45.673
in the first place.

22:45.773 --> 22:47.742
He ain't so bad.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.412
Please, tell me you didn't
tell him where you're at.

22:51.512 --> 22:55.283
Max, relax, I haven't
talked to anyone.

22:55.383 --> 22:57.852
Good.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.608
What the fuck did I do?

23:25.146 --> 23:27.281
I loved her.

23:27.381 --> 23:30.016
That's called lust, not love.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.719
No, I'm serious.

23:31.819 --> 23:35.456
I've never felt the way
that I did for this woman.

23:43.029 --> 23:46.701
Oh, Jesus Christ.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.269
It's okay.

23:52.406 --> 23:53.174
Why?

23:53.274 --> 23:55.543
Why what?

23:55.643 --> 23:56.711
Why'd you.?

23:56.811 --> 23:58.112
Um.

23:59.914 --> 24:03.084
She was, um.

24:03.184 --> 24:05.319
She was breakin' it off with me.

24:06.420 --> 24:07.420
She just...

24:07.455 --> 24:11.259
It's the way she did it,
it was just, uh.

24:11.359 --> 24:14.929
It was so cold. And I...
I just did not see it comin'.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.266
Come here.

24:22.637 --> 24:23.771
Ugh.

24:25.706 --> 24:27.542
What?

24:27.642 --> 24:29.110
I wanna talk to you.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.581
Okay.

24:35.983 --> 24:37.285
So talk.

24:38.319 --> 24:40.688
There's not
an easy way to say this.

24:42.823 --> 24:45.693
Laurel, what the fuck is this?

24:45.793 --> 24:47.161
I like you, Vince.

24:47.261 --> 24:50.164
You like me?

24:50.264 --> 24:53.167
This is crazy,
and it has to stop.

24:53.267 --> 24:57.471
Wait, no.
Wait, what about our plans?

24:57.572 --> 25:00.007
Where would we go?
Gino would come looking for me.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.909
Fuck gino.

25:02.009 --> 25:03.144
Come on.

25:03.244 --> 25:04.979
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

25:05.079 --> 25:08.249
Jesus Christ, Laurel,
why are you doing this?

25:10.518 --> 25:13.654
Come on, baby.
Don't do me like this, come on.

25:13.754 --> 25:15.623
You're gutting me here.

25:34.942 --> 25:38.346
Why didn't you ever
talk to pinero on my behalf?

25:38.446 --> 25:39.880
What are you talkin' about?

25:41.782 --> 25:43.484
Come on, Max.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.287
How many times
did I come to you?

25:46.387 --> 25:48.923
I mean, maybe, I wouldn't
be in this situation.

25:49.023 --> 25:50.157
Fuck, Vince.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.193
You gonna lay
a guilt trip on me, here?

25:52.293 --> 25:53.861
All I'm saying is that.

25:53.961 --> 25:56.897
Maybe if you'd talked to pinero,
I would've been all right.

25:56.998 --> 26:00.768
I wouldn't be in this
miserable situation right now.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.679
You better be a beautiful woman.

26:48.482 --> 26:52.053
Get the fuck outta here.

26:52.154 --> 26:53.454
Come in.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.436
Oh, my god.

27:11.439 --> 27:13.274
When did you get this, man?

27:18.245 --> 27:19.480
So?

27:25.786 --> 27:27.221
So what?

27:27.321 --> 27:28.889
It's 3:30
in the goddamn morning.

27:28.989 --> 27:30.458
So, what are you doing here?

27:31.759 --> 27:33.060
I wanted to come see my brother.

27:33.161 --> 27:34.162
Can't I do that?

27:34.261 --> 27:36.230
What the fuck are you on?

27:38.432 --> 27:41.068
Me and Bobby were out
partying with these chicks.

27:41.169 --> 27:43.738
And, uh, they had some coke, so.

27:44.839 --> 27:46.841
How much did you do?
You look like hell.

27:46.941 --> 27:49.810
I don't know, a lot.
Get the fuck off my back.

27:51.479 --> 27:53.981
Look, Vince, I gotta
get up early tomorrow.

27:54.082 --> 27:55.349
I got some work I gotta do.

27:55.449 --> 27:58.853
Um, that's actually
why I came by.

27:58.953 --> 27:59.754
What?

27:59.854 --> 28:01.288
I want you to
talk to pinero for me.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.491
See about getting me some work.
I'm dying over here.

28:04.525 --> 28:06.761
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

28:11.298 --> 28:13.334
Jesus, Max.

28:13.434 --> 28:15.569
How long you been
saying that, man?

28:15.669 --> 28:17.571
- What?
- What?

28:17.671 --> 28:19.416
How long you been saying,
"I'll see what I can do."

28:19.440 --> 28:21.375
You never say shit to him, man.

28:21.475 --> 28:23.344
Listen to me, Vince!
Now's not a good time!

28:23.444 --> 28:25.279
Why the fuck not?

28:25.379 --> 28:27.139
I mean, look at you,
you got everything, man!

28:27.215 --> 28:28.315
Money in your pocket.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.317
You have fucking
paintings on the wall!

28:30.417 --> 28:32.286
Two bedrooms, lots of space!

28:32.386 --> 28:33.697
I live in
a fuckin' studio apartment

28:33.721 --> 28:35.956
as big as your fuckin' bathroom,
you selfish asshole!

28:36.056 --> 28:37.259
Vince, you're wasted!

28:37.358 --> 28:38.398
Why don't you sleep it off

28:38.459 --> 28:40.694
and we'll talk about it
in the morning?

28:54.642 --> 28:55.919
- Here.
- No, I don't want to sleep

28:55.943 --> 28:57.044
on your goddamn couch!

28:57.145 --> 28:58.979
I want you to get me
a goddamn job!

28:59.080 --> 29:00.200
Vince, you're a fuckin' mess.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.449
Why would I go
to pinero for you?

29:04.385 --> 29:06.754
Max. You know what?

29:06.854 --> 29:07.988
Fuck you!

29:08.089 --> 29:09.089
Fuck you!

29:09.124 --> 29:10.424
You know,
I'll go to Seth myself,

29:10.524 --> 29:12.002
- that's what I'll fucking do.
- And what's Seth gonna do?

29:12.026 --> 29:14.262
Can't even get help
from my own fucking family!

29:14.361 --> 29:16.231
Vince, calm the fuck down!

29:16.330 --> 29:17.331
Not! You know what?

29:17.431 --> 29:18.833
I'll go to Seth,
he'll go to pinero!

29:18.933 --> 29:20.668
I don't need your fucking help!

29:33.681 --> 29:36.383
You see, you never helped me.

29:36.483 --> 29:39.553
I mean, I always asked you,
but you never helped me.

29:39.653 --> 29:41.989
I mean, I'm always rubbin'
two pennies together

29:42.090 --> 29:43.390
while you were doing just fine.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.559
I always helped you out
with money.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.727
I wanted to make my own.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.563
I didn't want
a fucking handout, Max.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.234
The truth is.
I thought you'd fuck it up.

29:52.334 --> 29:55.270
Okay? That's what I thought.

29:55.369 --> 29:57.738
What? Why the fuck
would you think that?

29:57.838 --> 29:58.873
Come on, Vince.

29:58.973 --> 30:00.613
You were always
blowin' shit up your nose,

30:00.641 --> 30:02.277
gettin' into trouble
here and there.

30:02.376 --> 30:04.545
Pinero isn't the type
to put up with that.

30:04.645 --> 30:07.448
You fuck up with him once
and you're dead.

30:07.548 --> 30:09.317
Yeah, okay.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.652
Thanks for having
so much faith in me.

30:13.954 --> 30:17.057
Vince, what can I do
about it now?

30:19.059 --> 30:20.527
I guess nothing.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.708
She told me she would leave him.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.913
And you believed that?

30:40.081 --> 30:41.448
Yeah, I did.

30:42.850 --> 30:46.321
Fuck you.
You don't know what we had.

30:46.420 --> 30:49.224
She was a married woman, Vince.

30:49.324 --> 30:50.457
We had plans.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.060
Do you know
how fucking crazy you sound?

30:53.161 --> 30:55.397
She was gino pinero's wife.

30:55.529 --> 30:57.064
He's the boss
of a major crime family.

30:57.165 --> 30:59.967
How far did you fuckin' think
you were gonna get?

31:00.067 --> 31:02.636
I don't know.
We didn't plan that far ahead.

31:02.736 --> 31:04.538
Oh, I wanna strangle you.

31:04.638 --> 31:06.616
If i'd've have known about
this relationship before,

31:06.640 --> 31:08.776
I would've kick your ass
and put a stop to it.

31:08.876 --> 31:11.745
You're living a goddamn fantasy
in your own head.

31:11.845 --> 31:14.048
You were gonna run off
with gino pinero's wife?

31:14.149 --> 31:16.384
I mean,
that's just funny sayin' it.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.652
He would've never
let that happen.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.688
He would have killed
the both of ya.

31:33.134 --> 31:35.270
Have you eaten anything?

31:35.370 --> 31:37.172
No, not since yesterday.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.240
Why don't you get cleaned up?

31:39.341 --> 31:42.377
I'll get us somethin' to eat.

31:42.476 --> 31:44.845
These are the only clothes
I have.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.582
I went to your place,
I got you some clean clothes.

31:52.886 --> 31:53.887
Here.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.260
Fuck, Max,
those are old clothes,

31:59.361 --> 32:01.329
I don't wear these anymore.

32:01.429 --> 32:02.863
Are you fucking kiddin' me?

32:02.963 --> 32:05.566
Go take a shower.
What do you wanna eat?

32:05.666 --> 32:08.169
Anything will do,
I'm fuckin' starving.

32:10.405 --> 32:12.072
Lock this door behind me.

33:33.421 --> 33:34.421
You my driver?

33:34.489 --> 33:35.989
That's right.

33:36.091 --> 33:37.091
Laurel.

33:37.158 --> 33:38.625
Max.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.495
Hi, Max.

33:40.594 --> 33:41.795
Hey.

33:43.565 --> 33:45.233
Let's go.

33:54.808 --> 33:57.978
You're
welcome to sit in the back.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.482
Does it make you uncomfortable,

34:00.582 --> 34:02.150
me sitting up here, next to you.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.784
No, ma'am.

34:03.884 --> 34:05.253
What am I, your mother?

34:05.353 --> 34:06.353
What?

34:06.387 --> 34:09.290
Ma'am? Hi, I'm Laurel.

34:09.390 --> 34:11.426
Remember me? We met earlier.

34:11.526 --> 34:13.428
How could I forget?

34:13.528 --> 34:15.096
If you're comfortable.

34:15.196 --> 34:16.196
Very.

34:18.133 --> 34:19.334
So, where to?

34:19.434 --> 34:20.901
Today's my free day.

34:21.001 --> 34:22.035
Free day?

34:22.137 --> 34:24.572
Yeah, once a week,
I get a free day away from gino.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.274
He bought me that condo.

34:26.374 --> 34:28.309
I stay there one day a week.

34:28.409 --> 34:29.743
Okay.

34:29.843 --> 34:31.212
Anyway, I was thinking

34:31.312 --> 34:34.482
you could take me
to the Beverly center?

34:34.582 --> 34:35.582
The mall?

34:35.649 --> 34:36.850
Yeah, the mall.

34:36.950 --> 34:39.820
Was thinking you can carry
my shopping bags for me.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.490
Um. Shopping bags?

34:44.825 --> 34:46.860
I'm just playing with you, Max.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.431
God, you should have seen
the look on your face.

34:50.532 --> 34:52.567
Well, I love going to the mall.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.868
Yeah, right.

34:54.968 --> 34:57.105
Well, the mall
will have to wait.

34:58.071 --> 35:00.308
Just drop me off at a friend's
house in century city.

35:00.408 --> 35:01.675
Sure.

35:01.775 --> 35:03.877
I'll let you take me
to the mall another day.

35:03.977 --> 35:05.380
Well, I'll look forward to it.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.480
Hm-hmm.

36:21.822 --> 36:23.658
- What'd you get?
- Burgers, cool?

36:23.757 --> 36:26.059
Fuck yeah, I'm starving.

36:30.030 --> 36:31.750
Put 'em by the door,
so we don't forget 'em.

36:31.832 --> 36:33.301
We'll have to burn 'em.

36:38.772 --> 36:40.375
Got you a coke, too.

36:50.951 --> 36:52.287
What'd you.

36:53.087 --> 36:55.022
What'd you do
with the murder weapon?

36:58.792 --> 37:01.496
Shit!

37:01.596 --> 37:02.863
Oh, man.

37:03.665 --> 37:04.898
Ugh.

37:04.998 --> 37:07.368
I think I dropped the knife
by the bed, after I...

37:10.204 --> 37:11.872
Fuck!

37:11.972 --> 37:13.574
All right.

37:13.675 --> 37:16.843
By now, the cops
have that in evidence.

37:16.943 --> 37:17.943
I'm done for.

37:18.011 --> 37:21.014
- Just...
- Max, if it's not pinero,

37:21.115 --> 37:22.317
it's gonna be the cops.

37:22.417 --> 37:24.261
I mean, shit, I'd rather be dead
than go to prison.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.187
Don't worry,
if you go to prison,

37:26.287 --> 37:29.157
pinero'll have somebody
on the inside take you out.

37:29.257 --> 37:31.259
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

37:31.359 --> 37:34.762
No, that's why
I need to focus here.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.063
As soon as the sun drops,

37:36.164 --> 37:37.632
we're gettin' out of here.

37:37.732 --> 37:39.866
I'm gonna step out
and make some calls.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.869
Are you sure? I mean,
who... who can we trust?

37:42.969 --> 37:44.871
I mean, who's gonna be
on our side?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.407
I got some people,

37:46.507 --> 37:49.610
some people who don't
necessarily like pinero.

38:02.623 --> 38:04.492
I've been meaning to thank you.

38:05.859 --> 38:08.061
For driving me around
the other day.

38:08.162 --> 38:09.764
I haven't seen you since.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.100
Yeah, I've been outta town.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.334
Where?

38:13.434 --> 38:14.435
Vegas.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.642
Don't worry about them.

38:21.743 --> 38:22.976
Huh?

38:23.076 --> 38:25.045
He's keeping tabs on me.

38:25.146 --> 38:26.147
Oh.

38:26.913 --> 38:28.649
Pleasure or business?

38:28.750 --> 38:29.784
What?

38:29.883 --> 38:31.152
Vegas.

38:31.252 --> 38:33.855
You go for business
or for pleasure?

38:33.954 --> 38:36.457
Oh, pleasure. I took my girl.

38:36.557 --> 38:37.792
It was her birthday.

38:37.891 --> 38:39.193
That's sweet of you.

38:40.395 --> 38:41.396
Yeah.

38:42.196 --> 38:45.566
Look, um, I'm pretty bored.

38:45.666 --> 38:47.735
You would mind driving me home?

38:47.835 --> 38:51.439
Seth's driving tonight. No keys.

38:51.539 --> 38:52.673
That's okay.

38:52.774 --> 38:55.810
I'll go get the keys from him
and then you can drive me.

38:55.909 --> 38:56.909
No, wait.

39:31.746 --> 39:32.747
Got the keys.

39:33.881 --> 39:34.881
Let's go.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.162
Where do you wanna go?

39:50.631 --> 39:52.133
Drive me to my condo?

39:53.367 --> 39:54.435
Sure.

40:00.408 --> 40:03.009
So, do you and your
girlfriend live together?

40:03.110 --> 40:05.613
No, she's got her own place.

40:05.713 --> 40:07.215
Is it serious?

40:09.083 --> 40:11.819
As serious as I wanna get.

40:11.919 --> 40:14.322
So, not too?

40:15.857 --> 40:17.291
Yeah, not too.

40:19.727 --> 40:21.195
Does she know that?

40:23.731 --> 40:25.399
We don't talk about it.

40:47.522 --> 40:48.589
You got a minute?

40:48.689 --> 40:49.757
For what?

40:49.857 --> 40:52.460
I mean, you gotta be somewhere?

40:52.560 --> 40:54.729
Not this minute.

40:54.829 --> 40:56.797
Why don't you come upstairs
and have a drink?

40:58.766 --> 41:00.568
I don't think so.

41:00.668 --> 41:01.668
Why not?

41:03.137 --> 41:05.106
Because pinero's my boss.

41:05.907 --> 41:08.643
Max, it's only a drink.

41:13.848 --> 41:15.349
You comin' or what?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.821
All right, one drink.

41:37.104 --> 41:38.306
Thanks.

41:39.206 --> 41:41.042
How long have you been
working for my husband?

41:41.142 --> 41:42.743
Two years.

41:42.843 --> 41:46.047
What do you do? Besides drive?

41:48.416 --> 41:51.686
If you think I'm naive

41:51.786 --> 41:54.021
and I don't know my husband's
into some bad shit,

41:54.121 --> 41:55.656
you'd be surprised.

41:55.756 --> 41:58.025
That is between you
and your husband.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.560
I'm not saying a word.

42:02.330 --> 42:05.199
It's kinda strange
you even have this place.

42:05.299 --> 42:07.401
You mean, it's not conventional.

42:07.501 --> 42:10.738
Yeah, I'll say.
I mean, what kinda guy

42:10.838 --> 42:14.275
lets his wife stay in a condo,
once a week?

42:14.375 --> 42:17.912
If you were my wife,
that wouldn't happen.

42:18.012 --> 42:19.313
But I'm not your wife.

42:21.682 --> 42:23.317
No, you're not.

42:24.552 --> 42:27.254
Gino and I have an arrangement.

42:27.355 --> 42:30.524
Keeps me happy.
I keep him happy.

42:30.625 --> 42:32.493
I shouldn't have
opened my mouth.

42:41.869 --> 42:45.339
I'm requesting that
you be my permanent driver.

42:46.707 --> 42:48.643
I don't think
that's a good idea.

42:48.743 --> 42:51.345
Why not?

42:51.445 --> 42:53.547
Don't you have a car?

42:53.648 --> 42:54.749
I don't drive.

42:54.849 --> 42:56.084
You don't drive?

42:56.183 --> 42:58.819
No, la traffic makes me crazy.

42:58.919 --> 43:00.488
It's easier to have a driver.

43:00.588 --> 43:03.324
Well, I'm sure gino'll
find you a good driver.

43:05.127 --> 43:06.927
Don't you like me, Max?

43:07.762 --> 43:10.731
Now you're fuckin' with me.

43:10.831 --> 43:13.868
No, I'm not.

43:13.968 --> 43:15.936
I just asked a simple question.

43:17.271 --> 43:19.373
Don't you like me?

43:21.175 --> 43:22.677
You're likable enough.

43:24.979 --> 43:26.614
Come here.

43:26.714 --> 43:28.215
Come where?

43:34.488 --> 43:36.290
I gotta be outta my mind.

43:36.390 --> 43:37.758
Just shut up.

44:13.161 --> 44:14.562
Take me home?

44:16.230 --> 44:17.531
I thought you were home.

44:17.631 --> 44:22.670
I mean, the home
I live in with my husband.

44:22.770 --> 44:23.771
Sure.

44:24.772 --> 44:25.806
Thanks.

44:46.861 --> 44:50.531
Oh, shit! I almost shot you.

44:51.699 --> 44:54.001
Lucky for you,
you fuckin' didn't.

44:54.102 --> 44:56.403
Where do you keep your
coffee cups in this shit hole?

44:56.504 --> 44:58.873
Second cupboard. Over here.

45:05.446 --> 45:06.947
So, I hope you don't mind.

45:08.415 --> 45:09.717
Let myself in.

45:09.817 --> 45:10.817
Sure.

45:11.852 --> 45:13.821
Made some coffee, too.

45:18.292 --> 45:20.661
Long night there, maxipad?

45:20.761 --> 45:21.829
Yeah.

45:21.929 --> 45:23.297
Yeah.

45:25.032 --> 45:26.967
I feel your pain.

45:27.067 --> 45:28.236
Hmm.

45:28.335 --> 45:31.839
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
Cha, cha, cha.

45:31.939 --> 45:34.875
A little emm?

45:34.975 --> 45:36.877
What's that?

45:36.977 --> 45:38.746
Early morning Martini.

45:38.846 --> 45:40.248
Coffee is fine.

45:40.347 --> 45:42.083
Coffee it is, comin' up.

45:55.496 --> 45:56.764
Where you been?

45:58.966 --> 46:01.169
My girl's.

46:01.269 --> 46:02.403
Your girl's?

46:02.503 --> 46:05.005
Yeah, Megan. What is this?

46:05.106 --> 46:06.507
You still seein' Megan?

46:06.607 --> 46:08.442
Every now and again.

46:14.182 --> 46:16.450
Oh, the evidence.

46:20.222 --> 46:21.222
Yeah, yeah.

46:21.289 --> 46:22.423
She still loves you.

46:22.523 --> 46:24.758
You can tell that
by a text message?

46:27.095 --> 46:30.497
She's a good girl, okay?

46:30.598 --> 46:34.368
Seriously, you should make
an honest woman of this one.

46:34.468 --> 46:35.545
'Cause I'm gonna
tell you somethin'.

46:35.569 --> 46:37.339
If you don't,
some fuckin' chachule

46:37.438 --> 46:40.908
will come along
and do it for you.

46:41.008 --> 46:44.478
You know why I know?
'Cause it happened to me.

46:45.546 --> 46:46.914
I was in love.

46:47.014 --> 46:48.883
- You?
- Yeah, me.

46:50.352 --> 46:55.290
Didn't propose, figured we'd
date forever, and what happens?

46:55.389 --> 46:56.457
Hmm?

46:56.557 --> 46:57.958
Some fucking chachule
comes along

46:58.058 --> 47:00.195
and scoops her away.

47:00.295 --> 47:01.528
Boom, I'm out.

47:02.529 --> 47:05.866
I'm sorry to hear it.
Sounds like a real sad story.

47:05.966 --> 47:08.836
Yeah, boohoo fucking hoo.

47:08.936 --> 47:09.936
But the next time.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.309
There's always a next time, Max.

47:14.408 --> 47:19.480
Next time, I'm gonna be the guy
to slam the fucking ring down.

47:23.285 --> 47:26.620
Why are you here,
in my apartment?

47:26.720 --> 47:30.724
Yeah, well, you and I have
to take care of some business.

47:30.824 --> 47:32.360
Gino wanted me to come get ya.

47:32.459 --> 47:34.139
You know, we just gotta
collect some money.

47:35.930 --> 47:36.964
Now?

47:37.064 --> 47:40.302
Now? No, I figured,
you know, I'd come over here,

47:40.402 --> 47:42.404
we'd, you know,
watch some gay fucking porn.

47:42.503 --> 47:44.738
I drink your shitty coffee.

47:44.838 --> 47:46.473
I got time for a shower?

47:46.573 --> 47:48.042
You better have time
for a shower.

47:48.143 --> 47:49.619
'Cause this motherfucker
is gonna smell you coming

47:49.643 --> 47:51.146
a mile away, okay?

47:51.246 --> 47:52.579
Hardee fuckin' har.

47:52.680 --> 47:55.950
Yeah, make sure you scrub
your balls really good there.

48:02.324 --> 48:04.292
Yeah.

48:10.165 --> 48:11.498
Which one is it?

48:12.733 --> 48:13.767
It's this one right here.

48:13.867 --> 48:15.669
What's that?
A piece of shit. Infinity?

48:15.769 --> 48:17.604
Silver infinity in the driveway.

48:18.639 --> 48:21.176
So what's the plan?

48:21.276 --> 48:22.509
You're goin' in alone.

48:24.912 --> 48:26.247
What the fuck for?

48:27.248 --> 48:30.218
'Cause you've been told.
He wants you to do this alone.

48:30.318 --> 48:32.320
Besides, you were gonna
fuckin' put a cap in my ass

48:32.420 --> 48:34.054
this morning, remember?

48:35.357 --> 48:36.623
What'd he do?

48:37.958 --> 48:39.518
How many fucking times
I gotta tell you?

48:39.560 --> 48:42.263
He owes us money, okay?

48:42.364 --> 48:45.266
Mr p. Wants him put down,
period.

48:45.367 --> 48:46.434
Like a dog.

48:46.533 --> 48:48.203
How's he gonna get paid
if the guy's dead?

48:48.303 --> 48:49.303
What do you care?

48:50.537 --> 48:52.740
He wants it done, you do it.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.508
What does he look like?

48:55.776 --> 48:58.279
Are you fucking serious?
Like a Barbra Walters special.

48:58.380 --> 48:59.481
What does he look like?

48:59.580 --> 49:00.690
He fucking looks
like your mother,

49:00.714 --> 49:02.117
fuckin' if she
shaved her mustache.

49:02.217 --> 49:04.285
I'm serious. What if the guy's
got a house guest,

49:04.386 --> 49:06.154
and I go in and pop
the wrong guy?

49:06.254 --> 49:08.722
Holy shit, you won't. Okay?

49:08.822 --> 49:10.662
We know what we are doin'!
He's in there alone.

49:10.758 --> 49:12.026
Get the fuck outta the car

49:12.127 --> 49:14.195
and fucking
take care of business!

49:14.295 --> 49:16.630
I'm cranky, I'm tired.

52:43.770 --> 52:47.275
Uh-huh. Yeah, got ya.

53:36.857 --> 53:38.626
Easy, easy.
That's it, that's it.

53:38.726 --> 53:40.728
Nice and cool and calm.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.471
Go, go, go.

54:04.452 --> 54:06.452
Hey, I just want to say,
good work back there, Max.

54:06.521 --> 54:07.522
Really.

54:08.955 --> 54:10.158
Really, man.

54:10.258 --> 54:12.427
So, listen, lay low
for a couple of days.

54:12.527 --> 54:14.228
All right? Don't make
a lot of phone calls.

54:14.329 --> 54:15.028
Don't go out much.

54:15.129 --> 54:16.531
Just, you know, keep it simple.

54:17.565 --> 54:18.565
All right.

54:20.101 --> 54:22.170
Now let me have the gun
and I'll get rid of it.

54:23.338 --> 54:25.038
I'll do it, I'll get rid of it.

54:25.139 --> 54:26.541
No, no, no, no,
let me have the gun.

54:26.641 --> 54:27.642
I'll get rid of it.

54:27.742 --> 54:29.042
Let's go.

54:32.213 --> 54:33.314
I got it.

54:35.849 --> 54:37.352
You sure?

54:37.452 --> 54:38.852
I said I got it.

54:44.192 --> 54:45.526
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, maxipad.

54:47.495 --> 54:48.830
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

54:48.929 --> 54:50.565
All right?

55:42.250 --> 55:43.618
What are you doing here?

55:46.120 --> 55:48.389
You gonna invite me in or not?

56:01.736 --> 56:03.137
Nice place.

56:03.237 --> 56:05.373
How did you know where I live?

56:05.473 --> 56:06.641
I have my ways.

56:06.741 --> 56:08.709
How'd you get here?

56:08.810 --> 56:09.943
What do you mean?

56:10.043 --> 56:12.480
I mean exactly that.
How did you get here?

56:12.580 --> 56:14.382
I drove.

56:14.482 --> 56:16.551
I thought you said
you didn't drive?

56:16.651 --> 56:17.652
Did I?

56:22.123 --> 56:23.324
Look, I gotta tell you,

56:23.424 --> 56:26.294
this makes me very
uncomfortable, you bein' here.

56:26.394 --> 56:27.628
Why?

56:27.728 --> 56:29.330
We can't be playing games here.

56:29.430 --> 56:32.065
I'm not playing games
with you, Max.

56:32.166 --> 56:34.535
You're a married woman.

56:34.635 --> 56:40.608
Look, somethin' happened today
that really fucked with my head.

56:40.708 --> 56:41.809
What happened?

56:41.909 --> 56:43.478
I-I-I can't tell you
what happened,

56:43.578 --> 56:47.047
but it made me realize
that this isn't worth it.

56:47.148 --> 56:48.516
What isn't worth it?

56:48.616 --> 56:50.485
This. We.

56:53.621 --> 56:55.256
Let's just keep
a comfortable distance

56:55.356 --> 56:57.859
away from each other. Okay?

56:57.959 --> 56:59.560
- Max.
- What?

56:59.660 --> 57:01.963
You really need to relax.

57:02.062 --> 57:04.732
Do you know
this could get us killed?

57:04.832 --> 57:06.334
If your husband finds out,

57:06.434 --> 57:08.202
I'm done for.

57:09.871 --> 57:11.506
I understand.

57:11.606 --> 57:13.574
Let's just keep this
professional.

57:14.876 --> 57:17.678
I'll drive you
wherever you wanna go.

57:17.778 --> 57:19.981
But that's that,
I'm your driver.

57:20.081 --> 57:21.382
Okay.

57:21.482 --> 57:22.783
Okay?

57:22.884 --> 57:24.919
Okay.

57:25.018 --> 57:27.588
I can't tell you,

57:27.688 --> 57:30.324
that's like a ton of bricks
off my shoulders.

57:30.424 --> 57:33.227
You know, you're pretty cute
when you're nervous.

57:33.327 --> 57:34.996
Oh, really?

57:35.096 --> 57:36.473
Then I must be the cutest guy
on the planet

57:36.497 --> 57:38.933
because whenever
you're around, I'm nervous.

57:39.065 --> 57:40.801
I make you nervous?

57:40.902 --> 57:43.571
The circumstances
make me nervous.

57:46.874 --> 57:49.477
You wanna fix us a drink?

57:49.577 --> 57:51.679
Yeah, sure.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.528
What are you doin'?

58:16.604 --> 58:18.472
Oh, shit.

58:27.348 --> 58:30.718
All right, I got us a place
we can crash tomorrow in Vegas.

58:30.818 --> 58:33.854
That will buy us a few days
until I figure this thing out.

58:36.557 --> 58:37.558
You done?

58:48.302 --> 58:49.637
Who the fuck is that?

58:53.541 --> 58:55.476
Bobby, again?

58:55.576 --> 58:56.344
Yeah.

58:56.444 --> 58:57.684
You better turn that fucker off.

58:57.712 --> 59:00.147
They got GPS; They could
find you by your phone.

59:00.247 --> 59:01.549
Here, give it here.

59:18.432 --> 59:19.734
Did you know Laurel?

59:21.168 --> 59:24.739
Yeah, I did.

59:27.308 --> 59:28.843
She was beautiful, huh?

59:30.344 --> 59:32.179
Yeah, she was.

59:32.980 --> 59:34.548
Did you ever get to know her?

59:37.284 --> 59:41.956
I mean, she was.
She was somethin'.

59:42.056 --> 59:45.760
She wasn't like
anyone I ever met.

59:45.860 --> 59:51.666
I mean, really the ballsiest
chick that I ever met.

59:51.766 --> 59:53.401
Yeah, I'm sure.

59:55.269 --> 59:57.371
Did you ever talk to her?

59:58.706 --> 1:00:03.744
Here and there,
only when I drove her.

1:00:03.844 --> 1:00:05.246
She ever mention me?

1:00:06.580 --> 1:00:08.683
Not that I could remember.

1:00:10.351 --> 1:00:13.187
I remember the second
I fell in love with her.

1:00:19.161 --> 1:00:21.996
How's... what's her name?

1:00:22.097 --> 1:00:23.364
Who?

1:00:23.464 --> 1:00:27.768
Uh-oh,
you're already forgetting her.

1:00:27.868 --> 1:00:29.804
Who?

1:00:29.904 --> 1:00:32.140
Your girlfriend.

1:00:32.239 --> 1:00:35.576
Megan? No, I didn't forget her.

1:00:35.676 --> 1:00:38.180
I just didn't know
who you were talkin' about.

1:00:38.279 --> 1:00:42.150
Uh-huh. It won't be long until.

1:00:42.249 --> 1:00:43.684
Until what?

1:00:45.352 --> 1:00:47.822
Until you're in love with me.

1:00:48.956 --> 1:00:49.956
You're so sure?

1:00:49.990 --> 1:00:51.859
Yeah, I am.

1:00:56.697 --> 1:01:00.534
I better go.
Gino is expecting me.

1:01:10.511 --> 1:01:13.647
I'll let myself out.

1:01:13.748 --> 1:01:15.549
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:01:25.259 --> 1:01:27.528
I just, I wish
I'd never have met her.

1:01:30.564 --> 1:01:33.367
If I could erase
one night of my life,

1:01:33.467 --> 1:01:35.369
it'd be the night I met Laurel.

1:01:36.537 --> 1:01:38.572
None of this
would have happened.

1:01:49.283 --> 1:01:50.918
That's a lot of blood.

1:01:54.156 --> 1:01:55.990
I'm gonna take a leak.

1:02:41.102 --> 1:02:42.603
Hey.

1:02:43.404 --> 1:02:45.372
Hey, yourself.

1:02:48.342 --> 1:02:50.077
Is that for me?

1:02:50.178 --> 1:02:52.180
Yeah, it is. I gotta get goin'.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:54.249
I didn't want to
just take off on you.

1:02:54.348 --> 1:02:55.983
Breakfast in bed?

1:02:56.084 --> 1:02:57.551
Yeah.

1:02:57.651 --> 1:03:00.855
No one has ever made me
breakfast in bed before.

1:03:00.955 --> 1:03:03.325
- Really?
- Really.

1:03:03.424 --> 1:03:05.526
You're the first.

1:03:05.626 --> 1:03:09.164
Oh, I hate to
do this to you but.

1:03:09.264 --> 1:03:10.265
But what?

1:03:10.364 --> 1:03:11.899
I'm a vegetarian.

1:03:11.999 --> 1:03:13.335
You are?

1:03:13.467 --> 1:03:14.467
I didn't know that.

1:03:14.535 --> 1:03:17.071
Hmm, well,
there's a lot of things

1:03:17.172 --> 1:03:19.307
we don't know about each other.

1:03:19.406 --> 1:03:21.542
Yeah, I guess so.

1:03:21.642 --> 1:03:23.043
You know,
I had a dream last night

1:03:23.144 --> 1:03:25.412
that we were out in public.

1:03:25.512 --> 1:03:28.983
Didn't have to hide,
just a couple, goin' out,

1:03:29.084 --> 1:03:30.885
without a care in the world.

1:03:30.985 --> 1:03:32.620
Well, you definitely know
it's a dream.

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:35.589
'Cause the world we live in,
we have to hide.

1:03:35.689 --> 1:03:39.294
Hmm, um, well,
wouldn't it be nice though?

1:03:39.393 --> 1:03:43.331
Go out for a nice dinner,
maybe a movie.

1:03:43.430 --> 1:03:44.832
Or both. Dinner and a movie.

1:03:44.932 --> 1:03:46.800
Share a bucket of popcorn.

1:03:46.901 --> 1:03:48.702
Yeah right, sounds nice.

1:03:48.802 --> 1:03:52.773
Hmm. Oh, but what about Megan?

1:03:52.873 --> 1:03:53.741
Forget Megan.

1:03:53.841 --> 1:03:55.361
It's more like what
gino would do to us

1:03:55.409 --> 1:03:56.744
if we were found out.

1:03:56.844 --> 1:03:57.844
Hmm.

1:03:59.914 --> 1:04:02.384
Besides, I'm not
seeing Megan anymore.

1:04:02.483 --> 1:04:03.684
Oh, you're not?

1:04:03.784 --> 1:04:04.785
No.

1:04:04.885 --> 1:04:05.719
What happened?

1:04:05.819 --> 1:04:08.689
Nothin', it just
kind of fizzled out.

1:04:08.789 --> 1:04:10.624
Did you break up with her
because of me?

1:04:10.724 --> 1:04:13.694
No, we just kinda
went our separate ways.

1:04:14.662 --> 1:04:15.996
Well, I like that.

1:04:16.097 --> 1:04:17.365
- Oh, you do?
- Hm-hmm.

1:04:17.464 --> 1:04:19.566
I don't like sharing you
with anybody.

1:04:19.667 --> 1:04:21.468
You're the one who's married.

1:04:21.568 --> 1:04:24.004
Do you want me to divorce gino?

1:04:24.105 --> 1:04:25.273
Huh?

1:04:25.373 --> 1:04:27.550
Do you want me to tell gino
that I'm leaving him for you?

1:04:27.574 --> 1:04:29.510
No, absolutely not.

1:04:29.610 --> 1:04:32.414
I like bein' alive,
you know, breathing.

1:04:32.513 --> 1:04:33.415
Are you sure?

1:04:33.514 --> 1:04:35.150
Yeah, I'm positive.

1:04:36.284 --> 1:04:37.618
I gotta get goin'.

1:04:37.718 --> 1:04:41.722
Oh, here. Have my bacon.

1:04:42.923 --> 1:04:45.360
You just say the word
and I'll tell him I'm leaving.

1:04:45.459 --> 1:04:47.761
You know, you're jokin'
but that's not funny.

1:04:47.861 --> 1:04:49.930
Who says that I'm joking?

1:04:54.369 --> 1:04:56.036
I better get goin'.

1:05:19.194 --> 1:05:20.194
Hey.

1:05:20.228 --> 1:05:21.228
Hey.

1:05:23.331 --> 1:05:24.631
What?

1:05:25.799 --> 1:05:27.868
I think I fell for you, Max.

1:05:27.968 --> 1:05:28.669
Yeah, I know.

1:05:28.769 --> 1:05:31.905
No. I mean it.

1:05:34.109 --> 1:05:37.345
I think that I love you.

1:05:37.445 --> 1:05:38.712
Hey, that's no.

1:05:38.812 --> 1:05:40.581
Do you love me, Max?

1:05:40.681 --> 1:05:43.917
Hey, hey, what is this?

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:47.455
You gonna make me say it?

1:05:47.554 --> 1:05:48.956
I wanna hear it.

1:05:50.258 --> 1:05:51.592
This is no good.

1:05:51.692 --> 1:05:55.929
Just shut up and say it.

1:05:58.433 --> 1:06:01.302
Yeah, I love you, too.

1:06:15.417 --> 1:06:17.751
Max, you okay in there?

1:06:17.851 --> 1:06:19.953
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.

1:06:32.267 --> 1:06:34.369
Hey, it's almost dark.
We gonna be leaving soon?

1:06:34.469 --> 1:06:37.372
Yeah. What'd you check
the room under?

1:06:37.472 --> 1:06:40.208
Um, fake name. I paid cash.

1:06:40.308 --> 1:06:42.310
Good. Don't check out.

1:06:42.410 --> 1:06:44.530
You don't want anyone else
gettin' a good look at you.

1:06:44.578 --> 1:06:46.157
Seth comes around here,
they're gonna tell 'im

1:06:46.181 --> 1:06:49.384
all about you
and which way you went.

1:06:49.484 --> 1:06:51.486
How long we gonna be in Vegas?

1:06:51.585 --> 1:06:54.089
Couple days at the most.

1:06:54.189 --> 1:06:55.889
Then where?

1:06:55.989 --> 1:06:58.725
We'll figure that out
when we get there.

1:06:58.826 --> 1:07:00.627
Yeah, fly by night
sort of thing?

1:07:00.727 --> 1:07:02.464
Yeah. That's the best
I got right now.

1:07:03.730 --> 1:07:05.567
I'm gonna pull the car
up to the door,

1:07:05.666 --> 1:07:07.335
we'll throw the bloody bag
in the trunk.

1:07:07.435 --> 1:07:09.104
Stay here
until I get back, okay?

1:07:20.681 --> 1:07:22.584
You wanna another drink, honey?

1:07:22.683 --> 1:07:24.685
Yeah, I'm low.

1:07:25.619 --> 1:07:28.189
Seth? Seth?

1:07:28.289 --> 1:07:29.690
Yeah, boss?

1:07:29.790 --> 1:07:32.059
Why don't you get the lady
another drink, would you?

1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:33.827
Absolutely.

1:07:35.230 --> 1:07:36.864
Yo, Max, scooch out.

1:07:43.837 --> 1:07:46.207
Get me another makers.

1:07:46.307 --> 1:07:47.408
You want something, Max?

1:07:47.509 --> 1:07:49.377
Yeah, another bourbon and diet.

1:07:58.086 --> 1:08:02.823
Kid, you're makin' me
nervous, sit down.

1:08:09.830 --> 1:08:13.000
I'm gonna go to the little
ladies room.

1:08:13.101 --> 1:08:14.101
Sure.

1:08:23.578 --> 1:08:24.579
Never got to thank you

1:08:24.678 --> 1:08:27.315
for that problem
you took care of for me.

1:08:30.050 --> 1:08:32.153
Seth said you done real good.

1:08:33.555 --> 1:08:34.988
Yeah, it was my pleasure.

1:08:42.230 --> 1:08:43.864
You know my wife?

1:08:45.133 --> 1:08:48.369
She likes havin' you
drive her around town.

1:08:48.469 --> 1:08:52.407
She told me, nobody but you.

1:08:52.507 --> 1:08:53.541
She said that?

1:08:53.641 --> 1:08:54.841
Yeah.

1:08:57.077 --> 1:08:58.479
Tried to have
other guys drive her

1:08:58.580 --> 1:09:03.484
but, uh, she's adamant,
only you.

1:09:05.620 --> 1:09:07.754
I don't know what's so special.

1:09:10.258 --> 1:09:12.493
Well, if I didn't
know any better.

1:09:12.594 --> 1:09:14.262
Oh, no, Mr. Pinero, it's just.

1:09:14.362 --> 1:09:22.136
Relax, kid,
I know you're not that stupid.

1:09:27.408 --> 1:09:33.181
You got a brain in your head.
Besides, she's a lot to handle.

1:09:34.649 --> 1:09:36.251
If you know what I mean.

1:09:38.486 --> 1:09:42.423
She's a bit of a.
Pain in the ass.

1:09:44.024 --> 1:09:46.160
What were you two talkin' about?

1:09:47.462 --> 1:09:49.597
Driving.

1:09:49.697 --> 1:09:51.132
Driving?

1:09:52.433 --> 1:09:53.900
Yeah.

1:09:54.801 --> 1:09:58.038
Yeah. How much Max loves

1:09:58.139 --> 1:10:02.443
driving you around
this lovely city of ours.

1:10:02.543 --> 1:10:05.346
Is that true, Max?

1:10:05.446 --> 1:10:06.547
Yeah.

1:10:11.185 --> 1:10:12.220
Thank you.

1:10:13.588 --> 1:10:15.889
Oh, no, no. Just slide in.

1:10:40.081 --> 1:10:41.316
Where you goin'?

1:10:43.718 --> 1:10:45.086
I'm going home.

1:10:45.952 --> 1:10:47.821
What's your problem?

1:10:48.756 --> 1:10:50.091
What do you mean?

1:10:50.191 --> 1:10:52.893
You haven't said
two words to me all night.

1:10:54.329 --> 1:10:57.864
Come on, Max. What is it?

1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:00.435
What is it?

1:11:00.535 --> 1:11:02.175
Yesterday morning
you told me you love me.

1:11:02.236 --> 1:11:05.540
And today, you're all
snuggled up with the old man.

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:07.442
That make you jealous?

1:11:08.842 --> 1:11:11.512
Just forget about it.

1:11:11.612 --> 1:11:13.815
No, I won't forget about it.

1:11:13.914 --> 1:11:16.049
You got a problem,
we talk it out,

1:11:16.150 --> 1:11:19.454
solve the problem, like adults.

1:11:19.554 --> 1:11:22.457
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

1:11:22.557 --> 1:11:24.092
What is it, Max?

1:11:24.192 --> 1:11:26.828
What's got you
all hot and bothered?

1:11:26.927 --> 1:11:30.631
You don't like seeing me
with my husband?

1:11:30.732 --> 1:11:32.467
We shouldn't
talk about this here.

1:11:32.567 --> 1:11:34.802
And where do you
want to talk about it?

1:11:34.901 --> 1:11:37.938
Your place, my place?

1:11:38.038 --> 1:11:40.508
I'm goin' home. Alone.

1:11:42.477 --> 1:11:43.678
Max!

1:11:43.778 --> 1:11:47.348
Ho, hey!

1:11:47.448 --> 1:11:51.952
Now you two, you two sound
like an old married couple.

1:11:53.821 --> 1:11:55.523
It's nothin'.

1:11:58.058 --> 1:11:59.594
Where's my husband?

1:12:01.863 --> 1:12:06.401
The boss man wants you to
drive the missus home tonight.

1:12:06.501 --> 1:12:08.503
If that's not a problem?

1:12:08.603 --> 1:12:10.204
Yeah, no problem.

1:12:10.304 --> 1:12:13.841
He's kind of tied up,
you understand.

1:12:13.940 --> 1:12:15.543
When will he be home?

1:12:17.145 --> 1:12:21.482
Who can tell?
But he wants you, missy,

1:12:21.582 --> 1:12:27.722
to go home tonight
and not the condo. Capiche?

1:12:27.822 --> 1:12:29.590
Yeah, sure.

1:12:35.229 --> 1:12:38.699
That's not gonna be a problem,
is it, maximillian?

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:41.436
No, no problem.

1:12:43.036 --> 1:12:44.605
Good answer.

1:12:50.111 --> 1:12:52.346
Well, I'll just get my things.

1:12:52.447 --> 1:12:54.382
Yeah.

1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:22.143
Jesus Christ.

1:13:37.091 --> 1:13:38.726
Are you gonna say anything?

1:13:38.826 --> 1:13:40.628
What do you want me to say?

1:13:40.728 --> 1:13:43.631
He's my husband, Max.

1:13:43.731 --> 1:13:45.299
I know. I just.

1:13:45.399 --> 1:13:46.601
What?

1:13:50.438 --> 1:13:54.408
I didn't like seeing you
like that, you know?

1:13:54.509 --> 1:13:56.277
Well, I'm sorry.

1:14:03.317 --> 1:14:06.187
You gonna open my door for me?

1:14:38.051 --> 1:14:39.520
Who's here?

1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:42.223
Just me. The cooks
aren't even here yet.

1:14:42.323 --> 1:14:45.760
And I'm fuckin' starvin'.
You cook?

1:14:45.860 --> 1:14:47.094
I can do toast.

1:14:47.194 --> 1:14:48.696
A toast.

1:14:50.831 --> 1:14:53.034
Oh, shit, you know what?

1:14:53.134 --> 1:14:54.669
I'm gonna take a cooking class.

1:14:54.769 --> 1:14:57.838
I heard you can bang some
hot broads in cooking class.

1:14:57.939 --> 1:14:59.774
Is that right?

1:14:59.874 --> 1:15:01.142
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, wait.

1:15:01.242 --> 1:15:05.346
That's right, you got your girl,
so Megan?

1:15:07.348 --> 1:15:10.151
Hey look, I want to talk
to you about last night.

1:15:10.251 --> 1:15:11.519
About what?

1:15:11.619 --> 1:15:14.355
That thing with
the big man's lady.

1:15:14.455 --> 1:15:16.057
Well?

1:15:16.157 --> 1:15:17.267
She was just mad 'cause I said

1:15:17.291 --> 1:15:19.126
I wouldn't drive her home.

1:15:20.061 --> 1:15:21.529
Uh-hmm.

1:15:21.629 --> 1:15:22.806
I don't know what it looked like

1:15:22.830 --> 1:15:23.840
from where you were standing.

1:15:23.864 --> 1:15:27.001
I just don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

1:15:27.101 --> 1:15:28.469
How could I?

1:15:28.569 --> 1:15:30.037
Well you see
a man, woman arguing.

1:15:30.137 --> 1:15:32.573
Yeah, arguin'.
Like an old married couple.

1:15:35.509 --> 1:15:38.412
I just don't want you to think
anything's goin' on.

1:15:41.248 --> 1:15:42.717
Like what?

1:15:43.718 --> 1:15:46.187
I just... I don't know
how you perceived it.

1:15:46.287 --> 1:15:49.190
How I perceived it?

1:15:49.290 --> 1:15:52.159
How I perceived it.
From my angle, it looked like

1:15:52.259 --> 1:15:56.731
you and the big man's wife
were havin' a spat.

1:15:56.831 --> 1:15:58.966
It was about the driving.

1:15:59.066 --> 1:16:00.434
Okay.

1:16:02.336 --> 1:16:03.696
I just want to
clear that up, okay?

1:16:03.738 --> 1:16:05.139
Okay, no problem.

1:16:05.239 --> 1:16:07.174
That's between you
and the big man's wife.

1:16:07.274 --> 1:16:09.143
My lips are sealed.

1:16:11.812 --> 1:16:13.280
Thanks, man.

1:16:14.582 --> 1:16:16.183
Hey, maxipad?

1:16:17.184 --> 1:16:18.586
If I were you,

1:16:18.686 --> 1:16:21.422
I'd be a lil' more sneakier
than you're bein'.

1:16:23.791 --> 1:16:25.593
You know what I mean?

1:16:27.595 --> 1:16:30.698
Hey, go make us
some nice toast, huh?

1:16:54.722 --> 1:16:56.223
Max?

1:17:04.099 --> 1:17:04.999
What is it now?

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:06.634
We got to stop this.

1:17:06.734 --> 1:17:07.734
Stop what?

1:17:07.802 --> 1:17:09.303
Seth knows about us.

1:17:09.403 --> 1:17:10.504
He tell you that?

1:17:10.604 --> 1:17:12.907
In not so many words,
but he knows, trust me.

1:17:13.007 --> 1:17:14.142
How do you know that?

1:17:14.241 --> 1:17:16.444
In his smug way,
he was lettin' me know.

1:17:16.544 --> 1:17:20.514
He probably keeps tabs on you.
He probably watches this place.

1:17:20.614 --> 1:17:22.383
I mean, how many times
have I been here?

1:17:22.483 --> 1:17:24.852
He probably sees me
comin' and goin'.

1:17:24.952 --> 1:17:26.454
Like tonight?

1:17:27.388 --> 1:17:29.423
I'm comin' over
for a different reason.

1:17:29.523 --> 1:17:31.668
I just want you to understand
that we have got to end this,

1:17:31.692 --> 1:17:33.327
for the sake of
both of our lives.

1:17:33.427 --> 1:17:35.163
Look Max,
you've been freaked out

1:17:35.262 --> 1:17:36.530
before, you'll get over it.

1:17:36.630 --> 1:17:37.665
No, no, Laurel. I mean it.

1:17:37.765 --> 1:17:40.267
I'm puttin' my foot down.
This is it.

1:17:40.367 --> 1:17:42.570
- Oh, Max.
- No, Laurel.

1:17:42.670 --> 1:17:44.472
We'll both be thankful
that it ended now

1:17:44.572 --> 1:17:47.041
and not before somethin'
really bad happens, you know?

1:17:47.142 --> 1:17:50.145
Well, what if
I don't want it to end?

1:17:50.244 --> 1:17:52.313
Want, and what has to happen,

1:17:52.413 --> 1:17:54.782
are two completely
different things.

1:17:54.882 --> 1:17:56.250
This is it.

1:17:57.284 --> 1:18:00.821
Look, let's just do
what's right here.

1:18:01.956 --> 1:18:03.290
You're married.

1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:07.328
I wish you weren't, but you are.

1:18:12.134 --> 1:18:13.801
Max.

1:19:33.647 --> 1:19:34.715
Hang out for a sec,

1:19:34.815 --> 1:19:35.926
I'm gonna throw these
in the trunk.

1:19:35.950 --> 1:19:37.261
Then I'm gonna come back
and get you

1:19:37.285 --> 1:19:38.519
and we're outta here.

1:19:38.619 --> 1:19:40.421
I... I better
take a piss before we go.

1:19:40.521 --> 1:19:42.623
- Hurry the fuck up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:20:12.853 --> 1:20:14.256
Fuck.

1:20:16.590 --> 1:20:18.492
Vince, we got a problem!

1:20:29.304 --> 1:20:31.405
Fuck! It's Seth!

1:21:00.968 --> 1:21:02.503
<i>Vince, it's Seth.</i>

1:21:02.603 --> 1:21:03.704
<i>Sent Max your way.</i>

1:21:03.804 --> 1:21:05.240
<i>Now it's your time
to shine, kid,</i>

1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:06.807
<i>fuckin' show us what you got.</i>

1:21:07.841 --> 1:21:09.610
All right, kid.

1:21:09.710 --> 1:21:12.646
You keep comin' to me for a job.
All right?

1:21:12.746 --> 1:21:15.083
Well, today is your lucky day.

1:21:18.353 --> 1:21:20.054
What do ya got?

1:21:22.257 --> 1:21:26.961
Well, we got somethin'
that's gonna test your mettle.

1:21:28.330 --> 1:21:30.998
Now, the boss man wants you
there at eight o'clock.

1:21:31.099 --> 1:21:33.634
Eight o'clock. All right?

1:21:33.734 --> 1:21:37.938
On time is late,
early is on time.

1:21:38.038 --> 1:21:39.573
Now, he'll give you
all the details.

1:21:39.673 --> 1:21:40.874
You think you can do that?

1:21:40.975 --> 1:21:42.719
Yeah, I can do it.
Just give me a goddamn job,

1:21:42.743 --> 1:21:45.012
I don't care what it is.

1:21:51.752 --> 1:21:53.821
We'll see about that.

1:21:58.726 --> 1:22:02.863
Hey Vince, don't be late.

1:22:27.255 --> 1:22:29.424
She's pretty.

1:22:29.523 --> 1:22:30.724
Daughter?

1:22:30.824 --> 1:22:34.995
Fuck you! That's my wife.

1:22:35.096 --> 1:22:37.064
- Daughter?
- No, Mr. Pinero, I'm sorry.

1:22:37.165 --> 1:22:39.600
I don't mean any offense.
I'm sorry.

1:22:42.002 --> 1:22:44.538
Take it from me,
you're a very lucky man.

1:22:46.474 --> 1:22:51.212
Here, I wanna
show you something.

1:23:17.871 --> 1:23:20.774
Go ahead, look at 'em!

1:23:45.933 --> 1:23:48.836
That is your fuckin' brother!

1:23:50.604 --> 1:23:52.140
I don't know what to say.

1:23:53.274 --> 1:23:59.280
I'm gonna ask you a question.
It's a simple yes or no answer.

1:23:59.380 --> 1:24:01.249
Do you wanna work for me?

1:24:01.349 --> 1:24:02.649
Yes.

1:24:02.749 --> 1:24:05.153
Then will you kill
these two treacherous

1:24:05.253 --> 1:24:07.621
pieces of shit for me?

1:24:12.494 --> 1:24:17.764
Hey! He just said, it was
a simple yes or no answer.

1:24:24.705 --> 1:24:28.809
You want me to kill
my own brother?

1:24:30.545 --> 1:24:32.880
And my wife.

1:24:40.088 --> 1:24:42.390
I want you to
get close to my wife.

1:24:46.127 --> 1:24:47.661
Come here.

1:24:56.003 --> 1:24:57.704
What?

1:24:57.804 --> 1:24:59.706
I wanna talk to you.

1:25:02.243 --> 1:25:03.677
Okay.

1:25:06.548 --> 1:25:08.048
So talk.

1:25:10.518 --> 1:25:13.121
There isn't an easy way
to say this.

1:25:14.855 --> 1:25:17.392
Laurel, what the fuck is this?

1:25:18.859 --> 1:25:20.461
I like you, Vince.

1:25:20.562 --> 1:25:22.763
Yeah, you like me?

1:25:22.863 --> 1:25:26.534
This is crazy,
and it has to stop.

1:25:26.634 --> 1:25:28.902
What? No, wait.

1:25:29.002 --> 1:25:32.507
Baby, wait a second, what...
What about our plans?

1:25:32.607 --> 1:25:36.144
Ugh, where would we go?
Gino will come looking for me.

1:25:36.244 --> 1:25:38.446
Fuck, gino.

1:25:38.546 --> 1:25:39.780
Come on.

1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:41.480
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

1:25:41.516 --> 1:25:43.750
Jesus Christ, Laurel.

1:25:43.850 --> 1:25:46.654
Why are you doing this?

1:25:49.257 --> 1:25:51.693
Come on, baby,
don't do me like this,

1:25:51.792 --> 1:25:54.095
you're gutting me here.
Come on, baby.

1:25:54.195 --> 1:25:56.130
No, no. Ugh.

1:26:01.669 --> 1:26:03.204
Vince.

1:26:03.304 --> 1:26:06.073
Remember when you asked me
if I knew your brother?

1:26:08.041 --> 1:26:11.412
Max? What about him?

1:26:11.512 --> 1:26:13.715
I know your brother.

1:26:13.814 --> 1:26:16.750
I knew him before I met you.

1:26:16.850 --> 1:26:24.525
I had an affair with him.
I loved him. I still do.

1:26:28.996 --> 1:26:34.868
Vince, I got with you
to make him jealous.

1:26:50.118 --> 1:26:52.120
Aren't you going to say
anything?

1:26:52.986 --> 1:26:55.055
What do you want me to say,
Laurel?

1:26:56.157 --> 1:26:57.692
Anything.

1:26:57.791 --> 1:27:01.095
Well, I don't have to
say anything,

1:27:01.195 --> 1:27:03.930
when pictures say
a thousand words.

1:27:04.031 --> 1:27:05.866
What are you talking about?

1:27:07.034 --> 1:27:08.770
I wanna show you somethin'.

1:27:15.777 --> 1:27:17.278
What is this?

1:27:17.378 --> 1:27:19.213
Go on, take a look.

1:27:28.089 --> 1:27:30.124
Gino knows, Laurel.

1:27:30.957 --> 1:27:32.327
He's always known.

1:27:32.427 --> 1:27:35.663
Ever since you two
got together, he's known.

1:27:35.763 --> 1:27:37.465
Why do you have these?

1:27:44.838 --> 1:27:46.907
Vince, you're scaring me.

1:27:47.007 --> 1:27:49.510
It's okay, don't be scared.

1:27:49.610 --> 1:27:51.479
I want you to leave, Vince.

1:27:51.579 --> 1:27:52.647
I can't.

1:27:52.747 --> 1:27:55.048
I'm asking you to leave! Now!

1:28:00.722 --> 1:28:01.756
It's okay.

1:28:48.169 --> 1:28:52.106
Call Max, set up the meetin'.

1:28:52.206 --> 1:28:54.442
Tell him where
he can find his brother.

1:28:54.542 --> 1:28:56.277
Not a problem, boss.

1:28:58.780 --> 1:29:00.448
Oh yeah,

1:29:00.548 --> 1:29:02.450
get rid of this trash.

1:29:05.486 --> 1:29:09.290
Max, yeah,
it's Seth, we need to talk.

1:29:10.224 --> 1:29:13.428
No, I don't want to say
over the phone.

1:29:13.528 --> 1:29:14.796
It's better in person.

1:29:45.359 --> 1:29:47.562
You got a few new messages.

1:29:50.063 --> 1:29:51.532
Seth out front?

1:29:52.667 --> 1:29:54.101
Um-hmm.

1:29:55.336 --> 1:29:57.971
I emptied it
when you went to get the food.

1:29:59.373 --> 1:30:03.043
So what, you're workin'
with Seth now?

1:30:03.977 --> 1:30:05.847
By way of pinero.

1:30:05.947 --> 1:30:07.348
Why?

1:30:07.448 --> 1:30:11.285
Come on, Max.
It's my time to shine.

1:30:13.287 --> 1:30:14.822
I was supposed to do this
hours ago.

1:30:14.922 --> 1:30:18.092
I've just been.
Workin' up the nerve.

1:30:18.192 --> 1:30:22.363
This is a burn on me? Why?

1:30:22.463 --> 1:30:25.199
Pinero knows
you been fuckin' his wife.

1:30:25.299 --> 1:30:28.469
He'd pictures
of the two of you together.

1:30:28.569 --> 1:30:30.104
You should've seen Laurel's face

1:30:30.204 --> 1:30:31.506
when I showed 'em to her.

1:30:31.606 --> 1:30:34.809
I saw her heart
literally skip a beat.

1:30:34.909 --> 1:30:36.944
And you killed her?

1:30:37.043 --> 1:30:40.848
She had to go.
Those were the old man's orders.

1:30:40.948 --> 1:30:43.484
She didn't deserve that.

1:30:43.584 --> 1:30:46.254
Max, she sealed her fate
a long time ago,

1:30:46.354 --> 1:30:49.055
way before she ever met you.

1:30:49.156 --> 1:30:52.727
Gettin' involved
with a guy like pinero?

1:30:52.827 --> 1:30:54.428
Now you're gonna kill me?

1:30:56.130 --> 1:30:58.933
Those are the orders, too.

1:30:59.032 --> 1:31:02.370
Vince, I came here to help you.

1:31:02.470 --> 1:31:06.741
Yeah, Seth knew
that you would, it's his idea,

1:31:06.841 --> 1:31:09.977
figured you'd come to help out
your poor ol' little brother.

1:31:10.076 --> 1:31:13.014
Well Max, I don't need
your help anymore.

1:31:13.114 --> 1:31:14.248
I'm movin' up.

1:31:14.348 --> 1:31:16.984
And when you're gone,
I'm takin' your place.

1:31:17.084 --> 1:31:19.186
Vince, you don't
have to do this.

1:31:19.287 --> 1:31:21.556
I told you, you never helped me!

1:31:21.656 --> 1:31:24.926
I always asked you,
but you never helped me!

1:31:25.026 --> 1:31:27.228
Now, I'm makin' my own way!

1:31:31.866 --> 1:31:34.168
You could make this easier
for me, turn around.

1:31:34.268 --> 1:31:35.803
Fuck you,
you wanna be a big man?

1:31:35.903 --> 1:31:37.538
Take your shot.

1:31:39.106 --> 1:31:40.608
Suit yourself.

1:33:27.982 --> 1:33:29.850
Fuck it.

1:34:51.398 --> 1:34:53.067
<i>And you killed her.</i>

1:34:54.301 --> 1:34:58.672
<i>Max, she
sealed her fate a long time ago.</i>

1:35:41.482 --> 1:35:43.350
That I love you.

1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:47.855
I love you, too.
