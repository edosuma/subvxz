00:02.040 --> 00:03.474
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.560 --> 00:05.836
<i>That dagger he had
negated our powers.</i>

00:05.920 --> 00:06.955
I just lost my speed.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.680
<i>I'm gonna make this
right, Gracie.</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:14.471
Every meta will die.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.756
So we're dealing with
a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

00:16.840 --> 00:20.038
<i>I give you Orlin
Dwyer, also known as...</i>

00:20.120 --> 00:21.236
Cicada.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.399
How many you shoot?

00:34.480 --> 00:35.994
Shot like a hundred.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.309
Any of them good?

00:37.400 --> 00:38.436
Bof.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.656
Guess we'll just have to keep
shooting till we get it right.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.353
I guess so.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.153
<i>Orlin Dwyer.</i>

00:47.240 --> 00:49.277
Near as we can tell,
he grew up in the Midwest.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.176
In and out of juvie,
pretty much fell off the map,

00:51.200 --> 00:53.271
and then popped up in
Central City a few years ago.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.056
<i>Part-time employee
of Szrek Chemicals</i>

00:55.080 --> 00:56.196
<i>for the last two years.</i>

00:56.280 --> 00:57.696
<i>Foreman says
he keeps to himself,</i>

00:57.720 --> 00:59.393
<i>pretty much a loner,
gave a fake address.</i>

00:59.480 --> 01:01.233
Did take custody of
his niece.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.959
Grace Gibbons.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.736
<i>After her parents
were unfortunately murdered</i>

01:04.760 --> 01:06.353
<i>by a meta-human, now...</i>

01:06.440 --> 01:08.272
So now we know why
Dwyer hates metas.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.320
<i>Once he got his powers,
he started targeting them.</i>

01:10.400 --> 01:11.856
<i>Powers he got the
night of the Enlightenment,</i>

01:11.880 --> 01:13.599
<i>as we all know,
when he was struck</i>

01:13.680 --> 01:15.760
<i>by a shard from the S.T.A.R.
Lab satellite explosion.</i>

01:15.800 --> 01:17.056
<i>Which was also
the same night</i>

01:17.080 --> 01:18.719
<i>that Grace went into a coma.</i>

01:18.800 --> 01:22.316
<i>Where Dwyer visits
her every day, every night,</i>

01:22.400 --> 01:24.631
<i>for the last three weeks.</i>

01:24.720 --> 01:26.393
So he's there now.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.636
- Yeah.
<i>- Oui.</i>

01:30.240 --> 01:31.833
Then let's go get him.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.279
"Let's go get him."

01:36.360 --> 01:38.160
How are you going to do that?
Look, as always,

01:38.240 --> 01:39.799
<i>I respect your spirit,
Barry Allen,</i>

01:39.880 --> 01:43.317
but as long as Cicada has his
dagger to dampen your powers,

01:43.400 --> 01:44.595
there's no stopping him.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.909
So let's destroy his dagger.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.190
How are we gonna do that

01:47.280 --> 01:49.112
<i>unless we have some kind of</i>

01:49.200 --> 01:50.998
power-dampening dagger
power dampener

01:51.080 --> 01:52.196
hidden away in storage?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.953
We don't,
but if we did

01:54.040 --> 01:56.191
we'd come up with a much better
way of saying that.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.317
Sure, I mean, just, like,
dagger-dampener...

01:58.400 --> 02:00.312
Wait, yeah, that's actually...
that's decent,

02:00.400 --> 02:01.896
'cause, you know,
you're running into...

02:01.920 --> 02:04.992
Just abbreviate.
P-D-P-D.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.157
Guys.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.959
What if we could make one?

02:13.440 --> 02:15.193
Make one what?

02:15.320 --> 02:19.234
What if we can make a weapon
more powerful than his weapon?

02:19.320 --> 02:20.993
<i>Cicada can control his dagger,</i>

02:21.080 --> 02:23.200
so what we would need would be
something more powerful

02:23.240 --> 02:24.310
than his connection to it.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.278
Wait, like...
like some kind of

02:26.360 --> 02:27.999
- supercharged magnet?
- Exactly.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.176
I don't know
if we have anything

02:29.200 --> 02:30.600
strong enough for that.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.558
We made Sally out of
a micro-composite alloy.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.233
As far as satellites go,
she's...

02:34.320 --> 02:36.039
she was heavy-duty.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.816
<i>And even if we could
get our hands on the dagger,</i>

02:37.840 --> 02:39.696
we'd still have to figure out
how to take the dark matter out

02:39.720 --> 02:41.520
- to negate its powers.
- Well, exactly right.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.456
I mean, what you're suggesting
is we find an alloy...

02:43.480 --> 02:45.711
No, no, indestructible alloy

02:45.800 --> 02:48.076
that has super-magnetic
properties

02:48.160 --> 02:51.437
but also has the ability
to negate dark matter.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.752
I mean, where are we going
to find such a thing?

02:54.840 --> 02:56.513
The past.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.276
The past?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.955
You've already come across
everything that we need, right?

03:01.040 --> 03:03.430
A strong alloy with
magnetic properties.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.193
Savitar's suit.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.839
Something to remove
dark matter.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.354
The Speed Force transmitter

03:08.440 --> 03:10.079
that Zoom used
to steal Barry's speed.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.520
Yeah, but that was
his Speed Force.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.000
Yeah,
but those are exotic particles,

03:13.080 --> 03:14.856
which are basically the same
thing as dark energy,

03:14.880 --> 03:17.315
so we would just need some
of that to recalibrate it.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.039
Can... can you do that?

03:19.120 --> 03:21.316
I mean, you'd have
to infuse the transmitter

03:21.400 --> 03:22.800
with the same kind of
dark matter.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.395
Like the DeVoe kind?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.597
More like
the Particle Accelerator kind.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.479
I'm sorry, we... we need to
blow up S.T.A.R. Labs again?

03:30.560 --> 03:31.835
No, no, not again.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.594
We just need to go back to the
first time that it happened.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.558
This is gonna mess with
the timeline too much.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.599
No, it's not. Savitar's suit,
the transmitter,

03:39.680 --> 03:41.831
these are all just
discarded objects in time,

03:41.920 --> 03:44.480
so if we steal them, it won't
affect anything at all.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.632
Even if all of that worked,
we can't just waltz

03:47.720 --> 03:48.756
into the hospital with

03:48.840 --> 03:50.797
<i>our soon-to-be-named
dampening device.</i>

03:50.880 --> 03:53.634
Dwyer smells us coming,
he's gone.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.155
Then we do a time hack.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.993
A time hack?

03:58.080 --> 03:59.080
Is when you...

03:59.160 --> 04:00.480
<i>Plant something in the past</i>

04:00.520 --> 04:02.637
so it's available in
the future.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.991
You go back,
you take the device,

04:05.080 --> 04:06.992
and you hide it near
the hospital.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.993
Somewhere it won't be found
for five years.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.280
He won't even know it's there.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.030
So you and your father
go back to the past

04:15.120 --> 04:17.839
to defeat Cicada
in the future.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.400
Quite an off-the-cuff plan
you've come up with.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
We can do this.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.438
No.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.315
I can do it.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.600
<i>Can you guys figure out
the best dates to go back to?</i>

04:35.680 --> 04:37.512
We're on it.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.736
<i>- You're not coming with me.
- Why?</i>

04:44.760 --> 04:47.480
Every time I try something
like this I nearly get killed.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.336
Well, yeah, all the more
reason for me to come with you,

04:49.360 --> 04:51.256
so that I can watch your back
so you don't get hurt.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.873
It's too risky
with the timeline.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.997
All right, look, time travel,
it's complicated.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.480
I know,
I've already done it.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.756
And look what happened.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.316
Look.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.074
I just want to fix what
I screwed up.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.556
Okay, what I did.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.599
Please, let me come with you.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.114
Not today.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.672
You think she should
come with me?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.439
Yeah, Barry, I do.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.874
Iris, if I do this,

05:27.960 --> 05:29.553
I'm going back to some
crazy times.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.400
Savitar, Zoom, Thawne,
Speedsters...

05:32.480 --> 05:34.949
Who you've all outsmarted
and defeated.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.034
Look, this was her idea, Barry.
Her solution.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.589
And it's a good one.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.399
So, unless you have
a better reason

05:43.480 --> 05:45.915
why she should stay back...

05:48.240 --> 05:49.799
let her do this.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.674
Okay, these are
the best of times.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.717
Incidentally, they were also
the worst of times,

05:57.800 --> 06:00.269
but in terms of going back,
this is it.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.920
Savitar.
When we defeated him,

06:03.000 --> 06:04.496
<i>Barry phased into his suit,
destroyed it,</i>

06:04.520 --> 06:08.150
sending pieces of it
flying far enough away

06:08.240 --> 06:10.630
that our past selves
wouldn't notice

06:10.720 --> 06:12.359
if Barry took
one or two pieces of it.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.999
- What do you think?
- Absolutely,

06:14.080 --> 06:15.536
Barry just has to get back into
the Speed Force

06:15.560 --> 06:17.040
before the timeline catches up

06:17.120 --> 06:18.800
and those pieces get erased
from existence.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.200
I'm fairly optimistic.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.954
Okay, what about the
Speed Force transmitter thingy?

06:23.040 --> 06:25.635
The night that Zoom injected
the speed force into himself,

06:25.720 --> 06:27.056
<i>he left the Speed Force
transmitter</i>

06:27.080 --> 06:28.355
in the viewing room.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.856
Yes, that's brilliant,
all he has to do

06:29.880 --> 06:32.520
is make sure no one's in there
when he takes it.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.990
What about when the Particle
Accelerator exploded?

06:35.120 --> 06:36.816
Well, right before everything
went sideways,

06:36.840 --> 06:39.560
Wells was in the cortex,
and we...

06:42.000 --> 06:43.832
We were in the pipeline intake.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.594
Ronnie!

06:50.680 --> 06:53.559
That's the best time for Barry
to go into the time vault.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.876
He can put a piece of Savitar's
suit in the plinth,

06:55.960 --> 06:57.872
and when the Particle
Accelerator explodes

06:57.960 --> 07:00.714
it should infuse it with
dark matter.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.917
Right.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.512
So once that's done,

07:05.600 --> 07:07.910
<i>we'll have all the pieces
we need to make the device.</i>

07:08.000 --> 07:11.471
We plant it in the hospital,
the rest is history.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.394
Great, let's go show
Barry and see what he thinks.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.116
I'll be right behind you.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.516
Where did I leave...

07:23.960 --> 07:25.519
Aha.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.349
What is this?

07:28.440 --> 07:29.760
What is that?
Nora's journal?

07:29.840 --> 07:30.990
What, are you stealing now?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.515
No...
yes, but for good reason.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.636
Look at this code.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.996
Have you seen this code before?

07:37.080 --> 07:39.037
- Yeah.
- Yeah, when?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.715
Right after Barry came out of
the Speed Force a year ago.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.234
And did you decipher
the code?

07:43.320 --> 07:45.710
Well, my computer did,
just one sentence.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.393
Ah, well...

07:47.480 --> 07:50.359
Hey, listen here,
space invader.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.990
Why don't you try returning
the thing to her,

07:54.080 --> 07:55.480
and then asking her?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.472
Of course.
Of course.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.153
Right.
Makes sense.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.277
Just return the...

08:07.600 --> 08:10.115
All right,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.793
let's do it.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.280
Cool.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.000
You're not gonna want
to forget this.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.319
<i>Had to make some adjustments
to the suit,</i>

08:20.400 --> 08:21.993
but I finally figured it out.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.878
For emergencies only.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.736
You don't want to get caught
running around the past

08:25.760 --> 08:28.116
- in your future Flash suit.
- Right.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.953
You might get ideas.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.635
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.277
Come on.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.953
Okay, look, follow my lead.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.350
Don't go off book.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.116
If anything goes wrong,
do exactly as I say.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.874
Do things usually go wrong?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.439
What?

09:20.520 --> 09:22.160
When am I gonna get the chance
to do that?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.840
Hey, game face.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.216
All right, so what do we do
while they're gone?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.400
Do we stake out the hospital?

09:27.480 --> 09:28.536
Get everything ready here
or what?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.233
Nothing.
They're gonna return

09:30.320 --> 09:31.913
to the exact same moment
that they left.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.071
Wait, so,
they're gonna go,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.720
but to us it'll be like they
never left?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.598
Yeah, time travel's weird,
isn't it?

09:37.720 --> 09:39.871
Here they go.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.713
Good luck.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.280
<i>♪♪ So take me away ♪♪</i>

10:10.000 --> 10:12.276
Are you sure
we're in the right place?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.918
Is that Savitar?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.036
That's him.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.274
Come on.

10:55.800 --> 10:58.315
<i>I only have
a few minutes left.</i>

10:58.400 --> 11:00.232
<i>If I am going to die,</i>

11:00.320 --> 11:03.996
<i>then everything you love
is going to die too.</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:06.231
Holy shrap.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.880
<i>How's it feel to get so
close to your ascension,</i>

11:19.960 --> 11:22.600
<i>and end up on the ground?</i>

11:22.680 --> 11:25.240
Now I see.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.880
- It's written.
<i>- Nothing's written.</i>

11:34.880 --> 11:35.976
- What was that?
- A Time Wraith.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.176
They protect the timeline.
I've got to get it out of here.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.271
Nora, you're gonna have to get
the shard, okay?

11:40.360 --> 11:42.920
Meet me in the forest where
we first arrived.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.359
Mom?

12:37.480 --> 12:39.517
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
Nice job getting that into
the Speed Force on time.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.915
Nothing to it.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.279
Dad, about Savitar...

12:47.360 --> 12:48.794
This is right. 2016.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.234
How do you know?

12:50.320 --> 12:51.576
Because that was Zoom
with Wally.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.035
I'm about to lose my speed.
Come on.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.359
- Barry, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.794
I'm okay.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.510
<i>Thank you, Flash.</i>

13:09.640 --> 13:11.040
Jay, stop!

13:11.120 --> 13:13.237
If you have any humanity left,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.789
then please let him go.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.240
Caitlin!

13:33.640 --> 13:36.200
<i>We gotta get Caitlin back.</i>

13:36.280 --> 13:38.272
Stay here.
Don't move.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.352
Okay?
Stay.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.112
No.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.316
What?

13:53.640 --> 13:54.676
<i>Barry...</i>

13:59.600 --> 14:02.399
<i>You can't let your losses
stop you.</i>

14:05.520 --> 14:07.034
You're the one who taught me
that.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.360
You have to keep moving.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.830
You have to...
push through.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.877
You have to find a way.
You have to fight.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.670
So that nothing will ever
hold you back, Barry.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.558
<i>Do what you can, and I know
you lost your speed,</i>

14:26.640 --> 14:29.474
but everyone's here to help.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.474
My dad, Cisco, Harry...

14:35.240 --> 14:37.311
me.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.670
Come on. Come on.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.319
Well, you change quickly.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.959
What?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.350
- Out of your suit.
- Yeah, no, I...

15:13.440 --> 15:17.150
Yeah, it was, just too weird
being in it without my speed.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.856
Well, that's your own
damn fault, isn't it?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.599
- I guess so.
- I know so.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.034
What are you looking for?

15:25.120 --> 15:27.510
I'm looking for anything
to help me find my daughter.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.159
All right, just...

15:34.520 --> 15:36.239
I don't have my daughter.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.755
You don't have your speed.
Zoom has Caitlin,

15:38.840 --> 15:40.296
and this whole thing... this
whole thing...

15:40.320 --> 15:41.376
is going to hell
in a hand basket...

15:41.400 --> 15:43.073
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

15:44.960 --> 15:46.394
Her frequency.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.709
- What?
- Jesse's frequency.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.958
People from Earth-2 vibrate
at a different frequency.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.316
Maybe you could track her
that way.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.399
Figure out how to find Snow.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.274
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.232
Let's build this thing.

16:11.600 --> 16:16.311
You're not going anywhere,
Flash.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.720
You got what you want,
Solomon.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.950
And who is this?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.353
Another Speedster.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.071
No, no, no!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.113
Damn it!

17:03.200 --> 17:04.839
I knew we shouldn't have
done this.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.314
Now we have no way to stop
Cicada.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.695
I mean, I don't even know
when we are.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.915
Dad, Dad, we can fix this.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.354
I can't fix this, Nora.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.590
Cisco can't even fix this.
This is Wells' tech.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.816
Well, let's go back to Wells.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.479
We can't.
Harry's...

17:15.560 --> 17:17.074
Harry's mind isn't
what it used to be.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.256
No, I don't mean that Wells.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.816
I mean the one that built
the Particle Accelerator.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.593
That's not Wells.
That is Eobard Thawne,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.034
the Reverse-Flash.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.713
I know, it's just,
he's really smart.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.576
So I thought maybe we could
convince him to help us.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.079
No, okay, look, no.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.756
The only person Thawne ever
helps is himself.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.433
Okay.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.957
I'm sorry, I just thought
that maybe...

17:37.040 --> 17:38.156
What?

17:40.280 --> 17:42.556
I know when we are.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.953
- Oh...
- Leave him. Leave him.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.696
- The less we mess...
- Mess with the timeline.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.120
I know.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.834
<i>I know what this is.</i>

17:54.800 --> 17:57.360
Three years ago
I traveled back to this day

17:57.440 --> 18:00.274
to get Thawne's help.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.750
So you have done it before.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.114
Well...

18:26.200 --> 18:29.238
things just got a lot more
complicated, didn't they?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.639
Barry Allen.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.313
But which Barry Allen?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.710
Clearly you're...

18:45.800 --> 18:48.190
- from a lot later than this one.
- Way later.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.714
Way later.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.597
Who's your friend?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.479
Let me guess.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.994
Jesse Chambers.
No.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.958
Libby Lawrence.
Wait.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.760
- Danica Williams.
- It doesn't matter who she is.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.999
She's your daughter.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.313
You've brought me
your daughter.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.511
It's, um...

19:20.600 --> 19:24.116
Dawn, if I'm not mistaken.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.793
Nora.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.760
Nora.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.272
Oh, that's nice.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.312
At least you still have one.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.675
Why, Nora,
time travel's so weird.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.400
What do you want?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.354
I need you to fix this
for me.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.440
No...

19:53.040 --> 19:54.599
No, if you're here...

19:56.920 --> 19:58.832
And he's here...

19:58.920 --> 20:00.400
- that means...
- You don't get home.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.630
I get home!

20:01.760 --> 20:04.070
I get home.
I go home!

20:04.160 --> 20:08.313
- I get everything...
- You don't go home, Thawne.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.594
Unless you help me.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.439
What do you want?

20:34.520 --> 20:37.080
Like I said,
you're gonna fix this for me.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.117
- To do what?
- Drain dark matter.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.456
- Whose dark matter?
- None of your business.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.816
- It is my business.
- No, it's not.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.896
There's no chance
that I help you...

20:42.920 --> 20:43.976
It's none of your business...

20:44.000 --> 20:45.320
Cicada's!

20:47.960 --> 20:49.474
Cicada's.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.230
The one who got away.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.016
You want to destroy
Cicada's dagger, don't you?

21:00.040 --> 21:01.190
We want to save lives.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.431
You want to save lives.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.034
I bet you do.
I bet you do.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.536
Especially your own, right,
Barry Allen?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.234
Look, that me,
he's gonna wake up soon.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.674
He sees me standing here,

21:12.760 --> 21:14.296
your whole timeline
is gonna be blown to hell.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.357
You're never gonna get home.
You know that's true!

21:16.440 --> 21:18.909
I know!
I know!

21:24.520 --> 21:27.718
Where are my manners?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.235
Can I get you a cup of water?

21:34.400 --> 21:36.676
So who made this?

21:36.760 --> 21:38.194
Someone smarter than you.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.476
I doubt that.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.190
You know, Allen,
for your plan to work,

21:44.320 --> 21:46.016
you're gonna actually
gonna have to have his dagger

21:46.040 --> 21:47.576
- in your possession...
- We've got that covered.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.034
You got that covered.
How's that?

21:49.160 --> 21:52.232
With this.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.118
Is...

21:55.600 --> 21:56.750
Is that...

21:56.840 --> 21:59.719
It's a piece
of Savitar's suit, yeah.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.800
Hmm.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.240
You know what's funny
about your dad, Nora,

22:08.200 --> 22:09.873
is he hates me.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.280
Hates me with a passion,

22:11.920 --> 22:16.039
and yet a version of him,
this Savitar,

22:16.120 --> 22:17.998
is a much bigger jerk
than I ever was.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.276
Did you see the face?
Did you...

22:20.400 --> 22:22.278
did you see the, like,
pizza face.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.835
- Can you hurry up?
- Yeah, I'll hurry up.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.720
I gotta tell you, Allen,

22:26.800 --> 22:29.679
using Savitar's suit,

22:29.760 --> 22:30.989
it's a smart idea.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.753
It was hers.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.994
Clever girl.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.714
<i>Oops.</i>

22:44.120 --> 22:45.713
Gotta go.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.758
I still look forward to seeing
how this all pans out.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.274
Nora.

22:56.640 --> 22:57.640
Hey, Dad...

22:57.720 --> 23:00.110
It's time to go back to
the night it all began.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.200
Come on.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.674
<i>Tonight, the future begins.</i>

23:22.760 --> 23:24.513
<i>The work my team and I
will do here</i>

23:24.600 --> 23:26.831
<i>will change our understanding
of physics,</i>

23:26.920 --> 23:29.310
will bring about
advancements in power,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.119
<i>advancements in medicine,</i>

23:31.200 --> 23:34.910
and trust me, that future will
be here faster than you think.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.751
Uh, why are we going
this way?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.638
Why don't we just speed into
the time vault?

23:47.720 --> 23:50.792
Because it's a big moment,
Nora.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.634
Thawne's been planning
this night for 14 years.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.518
If we use our speed,
he'll feel it.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.637
Feel a disturbance
in the Speed Force.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.791
I wouldn't do that.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.960
<i>Dr. Wells,
the accelerator is primed</i>

24:11.040 --> 24:12.474
<i>and ready for
particle injection.</i>

24:12.560 --> 24:14.376
<i>I feel I should say
something profound,</i>

24:14.400 --> 24:17.074
like, "One small step for man."

24:17.160 --> 24:18.674
What's happening?

24:18.760 --> 24:21.400
Wells is about to blow up
the city.

24:21.520 --> 24:22.816
All I can think of to say
is I feel like

24:22.840 --> 24:24.832
I've waited for this day
for centuries.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.190
Without further ado.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.596
<i>Dr. Wells?</i>

25:11.080 --> 25:12.753
Are you okay?

25:13.560 --> 25:16.758
Yeah, I'm great.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.478
I'm...

25:21.560 --> 25:23.836
Caitlin, do you think
you could have Ronnie

25:23.920 --> 25:25.696
run the Particle Accelerator
parameter numbers

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
just one more time?

25:26.800 --> 25:28.359
<i>Just for good measure.</i>

25:28.440 --> 25:30.591
- Sure.
- Great.

25:30.680 --> 25:32.433
And, Caitlin,

25:32.520 --> 25:36.514
the bottle of Dom
we've been saving.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.716
Is today the day?

25:37.800 --> 25:39.951
I think today might be
the day.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.600
- I'll go grab it.
- Great, be along in a minute.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.517
You got us on pins
and needles here, Dr. Wells.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.239
- It's exciting, isn't it?
- Yeah.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.596
Well, it's all thanks
to the team, right?

25:51.680 --> 25:55.230
Caitlin, fiancé Ronnie,
Hartley.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.994
- Hmm.
- Hartley contributed.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.118
Especially you, Cisco.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.760
I have to say I have a vibe
about you.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.720
About what you're destined
to become.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.473
I want you to know
I'm very eager

26:09.560 --> 26:11.631
to be along for that adventure.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.271
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.716
That means a great deal.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.600
Oh, did you...

26:27.680 --> 26:29.831
I didn't.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.480
Shall we just go turn
on an accelerator

26:33.520 --> 26:34.520
and pop some champagne?

26:34.600 --> 26:36.478
- I think...
- Okay.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.840
He's gone.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.400
<i>Good evening, Barry Allen.</i>

26:53.480 --> 26:55.153
<i>I was not expecting you
this soon.</i>

26:55.240 --> 26:56.390
She knows you?

26:56.480 --> 26:58.358
<i>I know you as well,
Nora West-Allen.</i>

26:58.440 --> 27:00.193
<i>Also known as XS.</i>

27:00.280 --> 27:01.920
<i>Fifth recruit in the rebooted
Legion of...</i>

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Gideon,

27:03.080 --> 27:04.912
the particle accelerator
is about to explode.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.080
<i>I need you to recalibrate
the system's chain reaction</i>

27:07.160 --> 27:09.441
<i>so some of the dark matter
is repositioned into this vial,</i>

27:09.480 --> 27:11.153
<i>and record no reports
of this...</i>

27:18.080 --> 27:19.480
Nora!

27:23.480 --> 27:25.392
You really hate him,
don't you?

27:26.760 --> 27:27.910
Do you not know what he did?

27:30.840 --> 27:32.797
I know he was your archenemy.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.118
He killed my mother...

27:39.480 --> 27:41.199
in our home

27:41.280 --> 27:43.112
when I was 11 years old.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.839
An 11-year-old boy.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.312
You know why he did it?

27:49.800 --> 27:52.838
He thought if I suffered
a tragedy

27:52.920 --> 27:56.152
that was horrific enough,
I'd never recover

27:56.240 --> 27:57.640
and never become The Flash.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.435
I... I didn't know that.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.760
There's probably a lot
that's happened to me

28:07.840 --> 28:10.639
that's not in The Flash museum.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.513
It's why you didn't want me
to come with you, isn't it?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.114
It's not because
it was dangerous

28:20.200 --> 28:22.635
or because of the timeline

28:22.760 --> 28:24.353
but because you didn't want me

28:24.440 --> 28:26.193
to know these awful things
about you

28:26.280 --> 28:30.399
so it's not what I would
remember most when I went back.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.479
You don't have to protect me
from this stuff.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.119
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.954
Yes, yes, I do.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.394
You're my daughter.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.472
Yeah, and you're my father,

28:41.560 --> 28:44.314
and I just want to know
my father.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.110
<i>Recalibration complete.</i>

29:00.080 --> 29:01.673
Here we go.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.279
<i>Dark matter retrieval
successful.</i>

29:30.800 --> 29:33.440
Let's go get our time
back in place.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.079
Spinal cord trauma,

29:35.160 --> 29:36.536
he's lost all feeling
to his lower quadrants.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.040
That's Harrison Wells.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.216
Dr. Wells, I need you
to squeeze my hand.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.640
That's a good sign.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.393
24-year-old male,
struck by lightning.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.437
<i>Need a full trauma panel.</i>

29:44.520 --> 29:46.079
<i>Get him to bay one.</i>

29:46.160 --> 29:48.550
What is happening to
this city?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.320
Grace's room is on
the fourth floor.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.635
This should work.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.074
Let's put it right here.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.880
We did it.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.270
Come on.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.519
<i>♪♪ Gotta be back in time ♪♪</i>

30:12.600 --> 30:14.637
Did you even go?

30:15.721 --> 30:17.154
Told you time travel
was weird.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.630
- Everything worked?
- Yeah.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.074
Is Dwyer still at
the hospital?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.160
Hasn't left her side.

30:22.161 --> 30:23.161
Did you plant
the transmitter?

30:23.162 --> 30:25.595
Yeah, we sure did.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.955
Let's go get Cicada.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.111
<i>♪♪ Back in time ♪♪</i>

30:57.400 --> 30:59.392
<i>You ready, Barry?</i>

30:59.480 --> 31:00.709
I'm ready.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.353
Cicada.

31:33.440 --> 31:37.036
Is that what you call me?

31:37.120 --> 31:38.520
Not all meta-humans

31:38.600 --> 31:40.478
are responsible for what
happened to Grace.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.314
Yes, they are.

31:43.400 --> 31:46.757
The destruction they cause,
the death,

31:46.880 --> 31:48.473
the pain.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.040
I know about pain and death,

31:50.120 --> 31:51.520
<i>taking it out on the world.</i>

31:51.600 --> 31:53.876
That's not gonna help.
Think about Grace.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.350
She's all I think about,
Flash.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.911
<i>And I'm making the world safe
for her.</i>

32:00.000 --> 32:02.754
Every meta-human must go.

32:02.840 --> 32:04.672
But what about you?

32:04.760 --> 32:06.114
You're a meta-human now.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.157
I am,

32:08.240 --> 32:12.120
and after you're gone,
I'll join you.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.834
All four of you.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.710
Come on, work.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.676
- It worked.
- It worked.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.991
Let's see how you like it.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.793
<i>Cisco, now.</i>

32:57.800 --> 32:59.280
Breach it out of here!

33:03.640 --> 33:05.120
Gotcha.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.395
<i>Oh, man.</i>

33:06.480 --> 33:08.392
You look like you're having
a day.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.552
Is it 'cause I just threw
your dagger into outer space

33:11.640 --> 33:14.075
or 'cause you're just now
realizing you didn't kill me?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.958
We stopped you.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.238
You stopped nothing.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.936
<i>The satellite's
tracking the dagger</i>

33:29.960 --> 33:31.474
back through the exosphere.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.951
Guys, Cicada's recalling
the dagger back from space.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.594
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.110
This ends now.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.157
Barry!

34:13.239 --> 34:15.391
No!

34:27.360 --> 34:29.272
Let's dance, cricket freak.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.237
Dwyer's not popping up
in facial recognition.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.233
And there's no dark matter
traces from his dagger.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.630
Well, he won't stay away from
his niece for long,

34:52.719 --> 34:55.554
and when he returns,
we'll be ready.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.997
Yeah, we will,
thanks to Killer Frost.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.434
I don't understand.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.239
How can she still come out?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.720
She didn't come from
dark matter,

35:03.800 --> 35:06.952
so I guess she's immune
to Cicada's dagger.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.311
She just might be the key
to stopping Cicada for good.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.791
Maybe we should go
check in with her.

35:12.920 --> 35:16.470
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.119
- Cricket freak, huh?
- Yeah.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.998
Just came out.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.955
Proud of you.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.836
- Hey, "Sher-loke."
- Sherloque.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.593
<i>- Du thé?</i>
- No, thank you.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.956
Have you see my...

35:48.720 --> 35:50.200
- Journal.
- Yeah.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.114
Forgive me,
but couldn't help but notice

35:53.200 --> 35:55.669
this composition.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.856
That's really nothing
special.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.712
But it...

35:58.840 --> 36:00.957
feels like something special.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.112
I don't like to brag,
but I speak a lot of languages

36:04.200 --> 36:06.431
and yet this one...

36:06.520 --> 36:08.034
this one I don't recognize.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.192
- It's a time language.
- Time language, really?

36:11.280 --> 36:14.000
It's used to record events

36:14.080 --> 36:15.799
regardless of changes
in the timeline

36:15.880 --> 36:18.839
so no matter what happens
I'll always remember my dad.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.879
Hmm, where does one learn
something like that?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.875
Time travel school?

36:24.960 --> 36:27.350
I created it, actually.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.320
You created it?

36:32.400 --> 36:33.436
Mm-hmm.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.280
Clever girl.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.034
I forget myself.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.349
This is yours.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.680
They were the best.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.795
Dad.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.037
- Dad, I didn't...
- It's all right.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.875
I understand.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.354
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

38:15.760 --> 38:16.976
Do you ever think
about stopping

38:17.000 --> 38:18.673
what's about to happen?

38:24.040 --> 38:25.076
Every day.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.271
Thanks for bringing me
with you today.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.429
It meant a lot.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.475
I'm glad you came.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.957
Hey, Old Man,
come on.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.040
Come on.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.751
Old Man?

39:24.040 --> 39:25.872
<i>Good evening,
Nora West-Allen.</i>

39:25.960 --> 39:28.236
Gideon, another data entry.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.551
<i>Entry uploaded and recorded.</i>

39:39.640 --> 39:41.120
<i>Shall I send it to
the same recipient?</i>

39:41.160 --> 39:42.514
Yes.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.750
<i>Entry sent.</i>

39:43.840 --> 39:46.196
<i>Would you like assistance
with anything else?</i>

39:47.720 --> 39:49.837
Yes, send a personal message
from me.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.640
<i>What would you like it
to say?</i>

39:52.720 --> 39:55.554
Actually, I'll deliver
it myself.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.232
We need to talk.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.920
Yes, Nora.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.757
Yes, we do.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.310
You failed.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.118
Why are you doing this?

41:43.720 --> 41:46.838
You did this to yourself,

41:46.920 --> 41:48.639
and now,

41:48.720 --> 41:51.189
all of you will perish.

42:23.440 --> 42:24.874
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
