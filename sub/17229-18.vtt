19:21.694 --> 19:24.163
YOU MADE A MISTAKE
AND THAT I'M CUBAN.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.464
AND THEY'LL BELIEVE THAT?

19:25.464 --> 19:27.767
NO! GOD,
YOU HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.411
THOSE GUYS ARE STILL GIVING ME
THE STINK EYE,

19:38.411 --> 19:40.112
EVEN AFTER I TOLD THEM
YOU WERE CUBAN.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.982
IT MAKES SENSE.
I JUST FOUND OUT THEY'RE GREEK.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.150
REALLY?

19:44.150 --> 19:47.153
TOO EASY.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.394
SO, <i>AMA,</i>

19:55.394 --> 19:58.197
ALBERTO TOLD ME
WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.667
OH, SO NOW YOU WANT
CHURCH SHORTS, TOO?

20:01.667 --> 20:02.735
NO, NO.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.670
HOW YOU USED TO GO VISIT HIM
EVERY DAY

20:04.670 --> 20:06.639
AFTER HIS MOTHER
PASSED AWAY.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.340
AH,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

20:08.340 --> 20:10.009
NOTHING.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.510
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

20:11.510 --> 20:14.013
NOTHING.
I THINK IT'S SWEET.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.248
WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU
ATTACKING ME?

20:16.248 --> 20:18.117
I'M NOT ATTACKING YOU.

20:18.117 --> 20:21.020
I THINK IT WAS A NICE THING
FOR YOU TO DO FOR ALBERTO.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.255
WELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
YOU THINK IT'S A NICE THING.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.557
WELL, I DO!

20:24.557 --> 20:26.425
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU
THAT I THINK YOU'RE GREAT!

20:26.425 --> 20:30.029
AND THAT I'M VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU AS A MOTHER!

20:30.029 --> 20:31.597
UGH!

20:31.597 --> 20:34.467
YOU KNOW HOW I HATE
THESE SAPPY MOMENTS.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.003
WE'VE NEVER HAD ONE!
