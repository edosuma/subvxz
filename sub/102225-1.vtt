WEBVTT

02:53.473 --> 02:55.375
Tom!!

02:55.409 --> 02:57.845
Come away from there,
it's dangerous!

02:57.879 --> 02:59.580
Hurry up!

03:11.491 --> 03:13.961
Where do you think you're going?

03:13.995 --> 03:15.963
You're supposed to be helping.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.575
Get this sorted.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.491
These are yours.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.726
- Yeah, well...
- I sorted my stuff.

04:19.761 --> 04:22.897
This is your mess, Tom!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.833
Us being here is your mess!

04:25.867 --> 04:27.935
Do you think I like being back
here living out of black bags?

04:29.837 --> 04:32.840
We were perfectly fine
where we were until you.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.785
Do you want to be in your own?

04:43.818 --> 04:45.653
Turned in that way?

04:50.124 --> 04:52.693
Stop looking at me like that.

06:14.075 --> 06:15.843
- You hungry?
- Hmm-hmm.

06:15.877 --> 06:18.378
Sit down there.

06:33.194 --> 06:35.196
What are you having?

06:35.229 --> 06:38.666
Eating in the morning
slows me down.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.502
I need to go to town
to get my single parent's.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.606
Have you seen the cutter?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.744
Tom?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.045
I haven't seen it.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.583
Stand up.

06:58.019 --> 06:59.854
Stand up, Tom.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.031
I said I haven't seen it!

07:11.766 --> 07:13.935
But you lie, don't you?

07:17.905 --> 07:20.741
You lie, you play with knives.
You fuck everything up for me

07:20.775 --> 07:22.109
and I end up back here.

07:23.945 --> 07:26.514
Leave it where I can see it.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.628
The problem is the documents
here say you've been living

08:14.662 --> 08:17.098
in the U.K. you have nothing
to prove residency...

08:17.131 --> 08:20.201
I know, I've just made it back
here. I need to get on

08:20.234 --> 08:22.003
the single parent's,
that's right, isn't it?

08:22.036 --> 08:24.772
I understand what you're saying,

08:24.805 --> 08:27.041
but if you don't have
your utility bill...

08:27.074 --> 08:29.810
I have no utility bill
because I have no utilities.

08:29.844 --> 08:34.015
I don't even have a phone yet.
But that's got to cover it.

08:34.048 --> 08:36.884
I've got those,
I've got my ID.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.619
What's to commotion?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.254
Look, I'm on my own here.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.289
It's the girl that's moving into
the old Matthew's mutton farm,

08:42.323 --> 08:44.058
granddaughter she is.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.993
What does that got
to do with anything?

08:46.027 --> 08:48.729
- Is that so?
- Please!

08:48.763 --> 08:50.631
Ah, we were all very sorry
about what happened

08:50.664 --> 08:51.999
- to your granddad...
- Get off me!!

08:52.033 --> 08:55.169
- Now, there's no call for...
- Please... thanks!!!

08:58.139 --> 08:59.974
Fuck...

09:06.113 --> 09:07.915
Prick!

09:13.854 --> 09:15.623
No...

09:15.656 --> 09:17.591
Ah fuck!!!

11:25.085 --> 11:27.021
Hi!

11:32.393 --> 11:33.961
I think we live
beside each other.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.957
Tom?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.259
Leave him, it's fine.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.162
No, it's fine.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.533
This is Ward, our neighbour.

13:51.566 --> 13:54.536
Glad to meet you, Tom!

13:54.569 --> 13:56.236
Tom is a little shy.

13:56.270 --> 14:00.608
Well, give it a good
squeeze there, lad, hmm!

14:00.642 --> 14:02.577
He needs to eat his greens.

14:02.610 --> 14:05.979
Not sure... next time
we'll do this for tea.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.414
Ah really, it's no trouble.

14:07.448 --> 14:09.883
Naw, we should be off.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.186
Well, see you soon, then.

14:13.688 --> 14:16.190
I'd have been lost without you!

14:22.963 --> 14:24.566
Bye!

14:53.360 --> 15:01.402
'...internal care of during
pregnancy and after delivery.'

15:18.620 --> 15:22.156
Great!

16:23.183 --> 16:24.652
Did you get a good
look yesterday?

16:26.420 --> 16:29.557
About what?

16:29.591 --> 16:31.158
That girl.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.430
No big deal, you know. It's
only natural to think about

16:36.463 --> 16:38.332
getting your end away, cooped
up in a place like this.

16:38.365 --> 16:42.102
What are you talking about?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.606
Just joking with ya.

16:44.639 --> 16:47.241
Can't you ever tell?

16:55.382 --> 16:58.185
You know the lake and fields?

16:58.218 --> 17:01.556
The dangerous one
I told you stay away from?

17:01.589 --> 17:03.691
Yesterday, it was half empty.

17:03.725 --> 17:05.392
So, you listened to me then.

17:07.795 --> 17:10.030
Come here.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.374
Look, we're going to have
to make a go of this.

17:20.406 --> 17:24.779
Being here. You don't
have a lot of choice.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.080
So, I need you to help me out
and not fight me on everything.

17:28.115 --> 17:33.287
Now, I tell you how things are,
that's how they are, okay?

17:34.789 --> 17:37.792
Don't make me feel like
I'm talking to myself.

17:39.561 --> 17:42.530
I need to hear you say it.

17:42.564 --> 17:44.398
Okay.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.803
Good.

17:48.836 --> 17:51.773
Now let's see if I can ask the
neighbours for a lift into town.

17:51.806 --> 17:53.541
They'll be getting
the car looked at.

17:53.575 --> 17:56.243
You're coming with me this time.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.716
You know we live like ten feet
away for my neighbours in Leeds

18:01.749 --> 18:03.183
and they never even
said "Boo!" to us.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.787
- Boo?
- Honey...

18:05.820 --> 18:07.755
So, what were you
at over there?

18:07.789 --> 18:11.726
Salon, off and on, doing nails.

18:11.759 --> 18:13.795
You picked the accent up anyway.

18:13.828 --> 18:16.396
It's every time we move.
Now that we're back here,

18:16.430 --> 18:19.834
we're talking like
muck savage, no offence!

18:19.867 --> 18:22.269
None taken.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.514
He can stay here if he wants.

18:33.548 --> 18:36.416
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Quite so.

19:13.554 --> 19:15.690
Your mom works fast,
doesn't she?

19:18.458 --> 19:19.627
And she's young.

19:22.697 --> 19:25.332
What was she when
she had you, like twelve?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.868
Don't talk about her like that.

19:26.901 --> 19:28.703
Alright, whatever.

19:28.736 --> 19:30.772
He's not exactly a catch.

19:37.879 --> 19:40.347
He used to work
at your place, you know.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.884
Just after he moved here.

19:42.917 --> 19:44.952
Doing fences.

19:44.986 --> 19:46.888
They all fell down.

19:46.921 --> 19:49.356
Didn't say he was
any good at it.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.964
We didn't think the old guy
on the farm had anyone.

19:59.433 --> 20:02.904
- What was he, your granddad?
- Great-granddad.

20:04.839 --> 20:07.374
She really is young.

20:10.511 --> 20:12.379
You know he was lying there
for weeks, before anybody knew

20:12.412 --> 20:13.715
he was dead.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.553
Nobody thought to check 'til
the animals started starving

20:18.586 --> 20:20.588
in the fields.

20:29.030 --> 20:31.231
Guess they weren't close.

20:37.739 --> 20:39.439
You don't talk much, do you?

20:44.411 --> 20:49.382
That's okay. I like it.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.528
Who's that?

21:00.561 --> 21:04.866
Tom, this is Col.
Col, this is Tom.

21:06.701 --> 21:08.536
Tom who?

21:08.569 --> 21:10.638
Tom next door.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.778
Where were you last night?

21:21.649 --> 21:23.584
This won't take long.

21:43.771 --> 21:45.740
What do you think?

21:45.773 --> 21:49.911
It's a big job, there's
a few days in it.

21:49.944 --> 21:51.746
Pricey?

21:51.779 --> 21:54.115
Parts of it.

21:54.148 --> 21:58.451
Ah Jesus, hard to say
without the parts.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.587
You'll give her
a good deal, now Ferg.

22:02.890 --> 22:05.993
- I'll do it for cost.
- You're a good man.

22:07.662 --> 22:09.831
He'll do it for cost.

22:19.140 --> 22:21.576
How's the peepin', Tom?

22:21.609 --> 22:23.811
Say nothing, yeah?

22:29.150 --> 22:32.920
Yeah, she works fast.

22:34.989 --> 22:37.825
That's what I say oh yeah.

22:37.859 --> 22:40.828
And take Holly with you,
show her your collection.

22:45.498 --> 22:49.503
I'll say one thing for the old
prick, he liked good whiskey.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.440
- Wait there.
- What?

22:53.473 --> 22:54.809
Just wait.

23:02.984 --> 23:05.452
Okay, come in.

23:09.857 --> 23:11.025
What are you doing?

23:14.195 --> 23:16.197
What are you doing?

23:16.230 --> 23:17.698
Just having me own peek.

23:29.243 --> 23:31.012
So, do you like it here?

23:35.249 --> 23:38.586
It's okay, nobody does.

23:48.162 --> 23:50.131
What's the range
on these things?

23:50.164 --> 23:52.700
Never tried them.

23:52.733 --> 23:55.503
Do we call each other?

23:55.536 --> 23:56.837
That, we can.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.678
You can see right into my room.

24:06.180 --> 24:08.448
I don't bite.

24:11.218 --> 24:14.722
Look.

24:14.755 --> 24:19.260
Window there. It's mine. See it?

24:19.293 --> 24:21.829
Well, now you know where I am.

24:23.731 --> 24:25.498
If you ever get lonely.

24:37.078 --> 24:39.479
I have to go.

24:45.553 --> 24:49.290
- Dad, I need to go.
- What's wrong?

24:49.323 --> 24:51.926
I just need to go, come on...

25:18.052 --> 25:19.854
- Did she say something?
- Did she have to?

25:22.023 --> 25:24.225
Aren't you just pissing
a circle around me?

25:30.297 --> 25:31.899
Have you something to say
or are you just going

25:31.932 --> 25:33.534
to stand there starring?

25:37.371 --> 25:39.306
You shouldn't take
them together.

25:39.340 --> 25:41.776
That's a myth.

25:48.949 --> 25:51.185
Just go, I'm tired.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.522
- I just want to know...
- Get out!

26:59.453 --> 27:03.757
<i>Tom!</i>

27:03.791 --> 27:05.759
<i>Tom.</i>

27:15.102 --> 27:16.637
<i>Tom??</i>

27:22.209 --> 27:24.812
Hello?

27:24.845 --> 27:29.083
- Meet me at the turlach.
- The what?

27:29.116 --> 27:31.252
- The lake.

27:48.402 --> 27:51.238
You don't know
what a turlach is?

27:51.272 --> 27:52.973
That.

27:53.007 --> 27:56.210
Yeah.

27:56.243 --> 27:57.378
Elaine told me
to stay away from it.

27:57.411 --> 28:00.347
Elaine?

28:00.381 --> 28:04.051
Well, she's right.
It's dangerous.

28:04.084 --> 28:05.486
It goes up and down.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.389
Yeah.

28:08.422 --> 28:11.392
There's an underground river
under this whole place.

28:11.425 --> 28:15.162
And it comes back
up to the ground.

28:15.196 --> 28:18.165
And sometimes it fills up.

28:18.199 --> 28:21.035
Deep and then when it goes back
down, it sucks things under.

28:23.037 --> 28:24.171
You can drown in it.

28:29.176 --> 28:30.911
I used to hear it in the back
of my head, you know.

28:30.945 --> 28:34.848
I can hear it.

28:42.323 --> 28:44.825
They hear it too.

28:50.197 --> 28:52.433
It attracts them.

28:52.466 --> 28:55.202
Like a heartbeat.

28:57.371 --> 28:58.939
See?

29:02.276 --> 29:04.445
Did you ever cut one in two?

29:04.478 --> 29:06.046
No?

29:08.516 --> 29:10.518
The two parts just keep
on going on their own.

29:10.552 --> 29:12.286
- Give it to me!
- No!

29:12.319 --> 29:15.389
Be careful. It doesn't
even hurt it, look.

29:20.127 --> 29:21.328
You said it wouldn't hurt it.

29:21.362 --> 29:25.099
Look, it's fine. See?

29:32.339 --> 29:34.208
Holly!

29:34.241 --> 29:36.277
Let's get out of here.

30:06.574 --> 30:10.210
Ward! Sorry, I was cleaning.

30:10.244 --> 30:14.114
Has Holly been here, she's
not answering her phone.

30:14.148 --> 30:15.349
Come in, I'll check.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.428
Tom?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.170
- No sign.
- I'll go look.

30:41.241 --> 30:45.580
Sorry, I just get worried
when she's out with the lads.

30:45.613 --> 30:50.084
Tom? You don't need to worry.
That isn't even on his radar.

30:50.117 --> 30:51.285
Still and all,
could you call him?

30:51.318 --> 30:53.153
He hasn't a phone yet.

30:53.187 --> 30:56.023
Still trying to get
on the scratcher.

30:56.056 --> 30:59.193
Listen, I'm probably the last
person to be giving parenting

30:59.226 --> 31:03.030
advice, but I was a teenage
girl, not that long ago.

31:03.063 --> 31:05.199
- Maybe just wait for them here.
- Hmm.

31:08.102 --> 31:11.171
He's not that kind of boy,
really isn't.

31:12.574 --> 31:14.509
So, where's your dad?

31:16.310 --> 31:19.012
Don't know.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.648
Ah, you're better off.

31:24.519 --> 31:27.955
Here, can you hold this?

31:27.988 --> 31:30.658
Thanks.

31:36.430 --> 31:38.332
You're not going
to watch, are you?

31:52.312 --> 31:54.381
Did you ever get
a crossbar from a girl.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.397
Let's go!

32:38.091 --> 32:40.528
I don't like not
knowing where she is.

32:45.032 --> 32:47.034
Girls can get into trouble,
can't they?

32:47.067 --> 32:50.137
They wouldn't tell
their dads about it.

32:50.170 --> 32:53.474
You don't have
to worry about Tom.

32:53.508 --> 32:55.375
You don't have to sit all
the way over there either.

32:55.409 --> 32:59.446
Come and sit down,
it'll be fine.

33:04.184 --> 33:09.289
I see her
with those lads of the town.

33:09.323 --> 33:11.358
It's the way she is.

33:11.391 --> 33:15.530
She doesn't mean it.

33:15.563 --> 33:18.265
But they can't help themselves.

33:21.569 --> 33:23.070
I should go.

33:23.103 --> 33:25.038
You look out for her, don't you?

33:28.375 --> 33:30.410
It's my job, isn't it?

33:30.444 --> 33:33.347
It's only the two of us.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.717
She's not as grownup
as she thinks she is.

33:35.750 --> 33:39.353
Hm. That sounds familiar.

33:41.589 --> 33:43.257
Can I ask about her mother?

33:46.360 --> 33:47.695
She wasn't interested.

33:49.531 --> 33:51.699
That sounds familiar too.

33:54.101 --> 33:56.203
Now, were better off.

33:56.236 --> 33:57.739
Sorry...

33:57.772 --> 33:59.674
You tell me to mind
my own business.

33:59.707 --> 34:02.175
Right, mind your own
business then.

34:07.314 --> 34:08.750
So, you'll wait around then?

34:11.150 --> 34:14.420
Just a while.

34:22.429 --> 34:24.799
If they're not back by dark,
I'll take the van out.

34:28.168 --> 34:30.370
There's not a lot of men like
you out there, you know.

34:30.404 --> 34:33.808
No? Ha ha...

34:33.841 --> 34:36.543
You know all the men
in the world, do you?

34:36.578 --> 34:41.181
No. Just feels that way.

34:44.418 --> 34:46.853
The last one didn't end
so well actually.

34:46.888 --> 34:49.556
It's kind of why we're here.

34:49.591 --> 34:52.125
There was a fight. I mean,
there were lots of fights,

34:52.159 --> 34:56.697
but this one got physical.
Just a bit, I mean a slap.

34:56.731 --> 34:59.801
And Tom went for him, got that
knife thing he carries around

34:59.834 --> 35:02.469
- and slashed him.
- Slashed him?

35:02.503 --> 35:05.506
Oh, it was just a scratch.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.274
Yeah, but you said
he slashed him.

35:07.307 --> 35:09.744
No, no, he got the wrong
end of the stick, it was

35:09.777 --> 35:12.245
- just a scratch.
- Well, which was it?

35:12.279 --> 35:14.749
He gets things wrong sometimes.

35:29.496 --> 35:31.331
Get the time off her would ya?

35:31.365 --> 35:33.801
What?

35:33.835 --> 35:35.503
Get the time off her, would you.

35:42.309 --> 35:44.478
Sorry, do you have
the time, please?

35:44.512 --> 35:47.180
- What?
- Do you have the time, please?

35:47.214 --> 35:49.717
Sorry? You shouldn't
bother me at all.

35:54.522 --> 35:56.624
Blow on it.

36:08.468 --> 36:10.838
Tom, we won!

36:10.872 --> 36:12.707
We won!

36:16.010 --> 36:18.311
Two teas.

36:20.782 --> 36:22.750
Can I then?

36:22.784 --> 36:28.288
No. It's the law.

36:38.866 --> 36:40.902
Thank you so much.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.847
Thanks.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.882
It's your winnings.

36:58.853 --> 37:00.722
What are you thinking?

37:00.755 --> 37:03.256
Nothing, I'm fine.

37:03.290 --> 37:05.425
That everything's fine?

37:20.608 --> 37:23.678
I'm not that cheery, you know.

37:26.681 --> 37:28.683
Sometimes, I need
somebody to talk to.

37:31.819 --> 37:34.387
Do you?

37:34.421 --> 37:36.524
Do I what?

37:36.557 --> 37:37.892
Need somebody to talk to?

37:37.925 --> 37:40.728
Oh, I don't know.

37:46.868 --> 37:52.573
Sometimes, there's stuff
inside you can't tell anyone.

37:52.607 --> 37:54.976
You know?

37:58.045 --> 37:59.847
Do you have that kind of stuff?

38:09.724 --> 38:12.026
Hold my hand.

38:17.899 --> 38:20.601
I know you found it.

38:23.638 --> 38:26.406
The baby. It's okay.

38:26.439 --> 38:27.942
Get off me!

38:27.975 --> 38:29.744
Tom?

38:29.777 --> 38:32.312
Tom? Please!

38:34.882 --> 38:37.552
Tom? Stop!

38:37.585 --> 38:39.554
You all right there, Hol?

38:41.622 --> 38:44.391
Babysitting again, eh?

38:44.424 --> 38:45.693
Get in, we'll give you a lift.

38:45.726 --> 38:48.930
You too if you want.

38:48.963 --> 38:50.998
Tom, please.

39:09.116 --> 39:14.856
Hey you! Is your mum the girl
there up in the mutton place?

39:17.124 --> 39:20.895
Stop. I told you not now.

39:20.928 --> 39:24.031
- Really?
- I said later, all right?

39:24.065 --> 39:26.834
Are you all right back there?

39:26.868 --> 39:28.736
Well, give me a puff then.

39:28.769 --> 39:30.538
Give him a jack
for riding you back!

39:30.571 --> 39:32.405
Col...

39:32.439 --> 39:35.810
They all heard, what did
you do to him, Holly?

39:35.843 --> 39:38.946
Do you think she's actually
gonna give you some?

39:40.715 --> 39:42.617
Fucking weirdo.

39:42.650 --> 39:44.719
Are you deaf?

39:49.690 --> 39:51.859
Tom?

39:53.761 --> 39:56.463
Tom!

39:58.699 --> 40:01.903
Tom?

40:01.936 --> 40:04.839
- Tom?
- Are you cracked?

40:07.808 --> 40:10.845
Did you hear me?

40:10.878 --> 40:14.916
Ah! Fuck!

40:14.949 --> 40:18.019
- He tore me this psycho!
- What?

40:18.052 --> 40:21.222
He has a fucking knife!
Look at my hand.

40:21.255 --> 40:24.926
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fucking prick!

40:27.161 --> 40:29.196
Holly?

40:34.735 --> 40:36.604
Come on!

41:06.100 --> 41:09.236
Tom? Where have you been?
Are you with Holly?

41:09.270 --> 41:11.072
Her dad's worried about her.

41:13.274 --> 41:16.143
Something happened?

41:16.177 --> 41:19.246
What's that? Is that blood, Tom?

41:19.280 --> 41:21.749
What did you do?

41:21.782 --> 41:24.685
Where is she?

41:24.719 --> 41:27.088
Answer me.

41:27.121 --> 41:30.024
Tom, Ward just wants to know
that Holly's all right.

41:30.057 --> 41:33.627
What's this then?
Is that yours? Is it hers?

41:33.661 --> 41:37.198
- She called. She called me.
- Stop! Stop!

41:38.666 --> 41:40.668
Hey!

41:40.701 --> 41:42.203
Come back down here!

41:46.707 --> 41:49.043
- This is on you!
- Ward, wait!

41:49.076 --> 41:51.245
We'll get this sorted!

41:51.278 --> 41:53.848
What the fuck, Tom?

41:53.881 --> 41:56.050
I swear to Christ,
if you've done anything!

42:02.623 --> 42:05.693
- I don't care, I'll fuck him.
- No, you won't.

42:28.182 --> 42:30.885
- Where were you?
- Nowhere.

42:30.918 --> 42:32.286
- Who were you with?
- No one.

42:34.021 --> 42:36.023
- You were with those lads.
- Fuck off.

42:36.057 --> 42:38.692
Holly!

42:42.396 --> 42:43.831
Oh my God!

42:43.864 --> 42:45.800
What did you fucking say
to me, huh?

42:52.339 --> 42:53.941
I know what you do with lads.

42:56.077 --> 42:57.745
You're a slut, aren't you?

43:01.782 --> 43:04.018
He found it.

43:06.887 --> 43:09.156
What?

43:09.190 --> 43:12.093
He found it.

43:12.126 --> 43:13.928
What are you talking about?

43:13.961 --> 43:16.864
You know what I'm talking about.

43:16.897 --> 43:18.632
You said it went under.

43:18.666 --> 43:20.201
I thought it did.

43:26.073 --> 43:28.609
How could he have found it
if you said it was gone?

43:30.211 --> 43:31.846
Huh?

43:31.879 --> 43:33.681
How can he have found it?

43:45.960 --> 43:48.762
Oh Jesus Christ...

43:55.469 --> 43:57.204
Don't go around,
do you hear me?

44:01.442 --> 44:03.344
I'll deal with it.

46:26.954 --> 46:29.123
Thank you for coming.

46:38.065 --> 46:39.233
You don't understand.

46:51.579 --> 46:53.447
It was me.

47:07.428 --> 47:10.230
I just...

47:10.264 --> 47:12.933
I just wanted it
to stop crying...

47:12.966 --> 47:15.402
until I knew what to do.

47:17.271 --> 47:19.541
Nobody even knew I had it so...

47:29.983 --> 47:33.187
I thought it'd get pulled
under when the water went down.

47:33.220 --> 47:35.824
It would be liked it hadn't
happened, you know?

47:43.130 --> 47:44.465
It wasn't Col...

47:53.641 --> 47:55.976
He's been coming into
my room since I was eleven.

48:14.027 --> 48:17.565
You have to help me, Tom. Okay?

48:23.538 --> 48:26.373
You have to make him stop.

48:30.277 --> 48:32.446
It's the only way.

48:35.517 --> 48:37.918
Come on, please.

49:52.727 --> 49:55.229
Tom?

50:04.471 --> 50:05.773
What are you doing?

50:05.807 --> 50:07.742
- Soaking wet!
- Yeah, I am.

50:07.775 --> 50:10.043
- Talk to me.
- Get out.

50:10.077 --> 50:11.613
- I'm not going
anywhere until we talk.

50:11.646 --> 50:13.413
- Get out!
- Tom, is something wrong...

50:13.447 --> 50:15.048
- GET OUT!!!
- Please!

50:15.082 --> 50:16.450
GET OUT!!!

50:53.153 --> 50:55.289
<i>Tom?</i>

50:58.526 --> 51:01.763
<i>Tom, please...</i>

51:01.796 --> 51:03.598
<i>You can't leave
me alone in this.</i>

51:27.889 --> 51:29.791
Did I say you could stay?

51:29.824 --> 51:31.693
Can I just sit for a bit?

51:34.494 --> 51:38.265
You have no outside
barters, have you?

51:38.298 --> 51:40.500
And that girl's not with you
because I won't have her back

51:40.535 --> 51:43.136
here causing a ruckus.

51:45.272 --> 51:47.508
All right...

51:47.542 --> 51:50.277
But not all day, now.

52:07.494 --> 52:08.863
Have you seen Tom?

52:10.665 --> 52:13.901
No.

52:13.935 --> 52:16.236
Well as he called ya?

52:16.269 --> 52:18.472
- What?
- On the walkie-talkie?

52:18.506 --> 52:23.276
- The what?
- You're not in any trouble.

52:23.310 --> 52:25.546
What about your dad, is he home?

52:25.580 --> 52:28.248
Yeah, he's here.

52:28.281 --> 52:33.253
Could you get him for me please?

52:33.286 --> 52:35.322
Dad?

52:43.397 --> 52:44.666
I'm sorry about this, I just...

52:44.699 --> 52:48.301
What do you want?

52:48.335 --> 52:53.841
Could you give me a lift into
town? I think Tom has run off.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.677
Please...

53:08.890 --> 53:12.593
- Have a yellow one.
- I have no money.

53:12.627 --> 53:15.763
For God's sake, where are you
going with no money?

53:15.797 --> 53:18.866
Don't know.

53:18.900 --> 53:21.936
Your mum's the Matthew's girl,
up at the old mutton place,

53:21.969 --> 53:24.371
isn't she?

53:24.404 --> 53:26.641
Won't she be missing you?

53:26.674 --> 53:29.242
You need to be strong lad,
to keep the place like that,

53:29.276 --> 53:32.345
- take it over.
- I just make her feel worse.

53:32.379 --> 53:35.983
Teenagers, of course you do.

53:36.017 --> 53:38.452
I want to get away.
It's better.

53:38.485 --> 53:41.856
Better for who?

53:41.889 --> 53:45.358
Your mom would be lost without
you. I'll get you a cup of tea

53:45.392 --> 53:47.929
to go with that.

54:14.555 --> 54:16.323
Hurry up!

54:21.028 --> 54:22.764
Come here!

54:51.659 --> 54:53.426
In the back!

54:54.829 --> 54:56.731
The table, check
under the table.

54:56.764 --> 54:58.933
Got him!

54:58.966 --> 55:01.368
- Stop!
- Calm down.

55:01.401 --> 55:04.337
Calm down!

55:06.941 --> 55:09.110
Tom? Tom!

55:09.143 --> 55:10.645
- Get off me!
- Get off him!

55:10.678 --> 55:13.815
Get away!!!

55:13.848 --> 55:15.082
Or what you slut!

55:15.116 --> 55:17.450
Back off, I mean it!

55:17.484 --> 55:19.620
Stupid bitch!

55:19.654 --> 55:22.422
You're fucking dead!

55:25.860 --> 55:29.462
Tom?

55:29.496 --> 55:30.965
Come on, let's go home.

56:03.463 --> 56:05.867
Tom?

56:05.900 --> 56:07.467
Give me your coat
and I'll hang it up.

56:09.203 --> 56:12.006
Leave him alone.

56:22.950 --> 56:24.886
It's my fault.

56:27.521 --> 56:33.694
I just kept moving us around.
And every time he gets worse.

56:37.098 --> 56:40.134
You know, I always promised
I'd keep him with me,

56:40.167 --> 56:44.805
no matter what, I wouldn't ditch
him like my parents did to me.

56:47.708 --> 56:49.610
Was I wrong?

56:51.478 --> 56:53.014
Sorry.

56:57.652 --> 57:01.756
You can't manage him on your
own. There's no shame in that.

57:01.789 --> 57:04.191
There's just something
up with his head.

57:09.830 --> 57:11.498
Can I get you a drink, huh?

58:04.085 --> 58:06.821
Where is it?

58:09.557 --> 58:12.893
I'm not a bad man,
but I swear to God...

58:17.698 --> 58:19.533
Don't make me...

58:23.637 --> 58:24.772
Do you love your mum?

58:26.574 --> 58:28.075
She don't know.

58:28.109 --> 58:31.612
Well, I'll tell her
and brake her neck.

58:31.645 --> 58:33.214
She don't know.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.655
What are you doing?

58:41.689 --> 58:43.824
I'm just checking on the lad.

58:45.726 --> 58:48.763
Did you put something
in my drink?

58:48.796 --> 58:51.265
I'm just checking on the lad.

59:02.376 --> 59:05.946
Go on into bed, I'll be into ya.

59:05.980 --> 59:09.917
No...

59:09.950 --> 59:11.952
I think you should go.

59:14.055 --> 59:17.625
Right now.

59:21.695 --> 59:23.764
I'll be back tomorrow.

59:25.966 --> 59:27.068
To check on the both of you.

59:36.277 --> 59:37.912
Okay?

01:00:18.085 --> 01:00:19.920
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:25.793
<i>Holly, are you there?</i>

01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:36.904
I'm here.

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:42.676
<i>I'll do it.</i>

01:00:58.125 --> 01:01:01.362
<i>Bring it with ya.</i>

01:03:03.618 --> 01:03:06.487
What?

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.322
It doesn't look so bad.

01:03:11.058 --> 01:03:13.127
It'll be gone soon.

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:19.800
Shouldn't you be over there?

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:28.175
After dark.

01:03:30.878 --> 01:03:35.449
He won't tell her, I'll
put the fear of God into him.

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:38.152
I believe you.

01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:45.059
You're my girl.

01:03:46.528 --> 01:03:48.429
I just want to keep you safe.

01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:55.135
I just want things to be
all right between us.

01:03:57.572 --> 01:03:59.473
I know.

01:04:02.376 --> 01:04:05.879
When all this is over, we can
go back to the way things were.

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:09.249
It'll be all right.

01:04:16.357 --> 01:04:18.158
I'm so sorry, pet.

01:04:30.938 --> 01:04:33.173
Dad...

01:04:44.051 --> 01:04:46.320
You should go.

01:05:38.472 --> 01:05:40.340
Tom?

01:05:43.578 --> 01:05:45.647
I won't come in
if you don't want me to.

01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:55.623
This isn't easy.

01:05:55.657 --> 01:05:57.991
Not for you either,
I do know that.

01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:07.134
I know I'm a terrible mother.

01:06:11.773 --> 01:06:14.341
I'm not a terrible person.

01:06:25.452 --> 01:06:27.522
There isn't anything
wrong with you, Tom.

01:06:34.228 --> 01:06:35.697
It's just...

01:06:40.568 --> 01:06:42.637
Things haven't gone
right for us.

01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:46.473
And it's not your fault.

01:06:52.514 --> 01:06:55.750
I just put it all on you because
I don't know what else to do.

01:07:04.759 --> 01:07:08.563
And I know I shouldn't do that.
But I just...

01:07:14.669 --> 01:07:16.436
I fuck things up.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.445
I fuck everything up.

01:07:35.289 --> 01:07:36.758
So, what I'm asking is...

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.630
Can we help each other out?

01:07:46.199 --> 01:07:48.235
Tom?

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:46.661
Is that it?

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:14.622
We don't have much time.

01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:32.840
Meet me by the turlach
when it's over.

01:09:39.246 --> 01:09:42.381
I can't.

01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:43.917
You have to.

01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:48.255
He's on his way
to your house right now.

01:09:48.287 --> 01:09:51.926
And if he doesn't find it
there, he will hurt your mum.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:55.195
Unless I call him back
and you do as you promised.

01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:01.669
Tom?

01:10:01.703 --> 01:10:03.838
Do you understand?

01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:08.408
Tom?

01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:11.813
What are you doing here?

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.953
I'm sure I told you I'd be back
to check on you and the lad.

01:10:22.422 --> 01:10:24.025
I just want to have
a chat with him.

01:10:24.058 --> 01:10:26.493
You had a chat
with him last night.

01:10:31.298 --> 01:10:32.567
I just want to talk.

01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.304
I think you should go.

01:10:57.558 --> 01:10:59.392
What?

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:04.832
You got it.

01:11:09.003 --> 01:11:11.438
I won't keep you.

01:12:54.942 --> 01:12:57.377
Holly?

01:12:58.746 --> 01:13:00.114
Are you there, pet?

01:14:36.277 --> 01:14:37.945
Where is she?

01:14:40.314 --> 01:14:43.184
How did you get in here?

01:14:43.217 --> 01:14:45.219
She let me in.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.930
What have you done
with the baby?

01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:58.566
She took it.

01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:08.542
- Let's go.
- Are you sure...

01:15:08.576 --> 01:15:09.910
Do you want to come
with me or not?

01:15:11.812 --> 01:15:13.581
Then drive.

01:15:29.096 --> 01:15:30.931
Bitch!

01:15:30.965 --> 01:15:33.034
Bitch!

01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:35.136
Tom?

01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:18.345
Get in!

01:16:59.787 --> 01:17:01.388
What did she tell you?

01:17:03.257 --> 01:17:04.992
I really don't know.

01:17:05.025 --> 01:17:07.094
That's his fucking mother!

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:12.933
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:14.301
Ah that's a lie!

01:17:16.704 --> 01:17:18.439
Right, now I hurt you.

01:17:18.472 --> 01:17:20.774
Jesus Christ all mighty...

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:26.313
You did this.

01:17:26.347 --> 01:17:28.382
You did this, you took her!

01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:34.088
Get off me! Let me go!

01:17:34.121 --> 01:17:36.157
You stay down there,
do you hear me?

01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:38.359
Don't fucking move!

01:17:41.962 --> 01:17:43.297
Jesus, it's your dad.

01:17:52.373 --> 01:17:54.041
The emergency
vehicles are on their way...

01:18:01.081 --> 01:18:03.017
Jesus Christ, Holly...

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:06.854
Keep going.

01:18:08.489 --> 01:18:10.324
Keep going!

01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:14.762
- Keep going!
- I'll see if they're all right.

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:17.164
Do what you want, but
I'm not ever coming back.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.259
Yeah... Where are you going?

01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:23.330
Where are you going?
Dead!

01:19:23.364 --> 01:19:25.232
You're fucking dead!

01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:31.939
TOM!!!!!

01:20:20.154 --> 01:20:22.356
You made me do this!

01:21:20.582 --> 01:21:21.915
AAHHH!!!!

01:21:33.193 --> 01:21:36.296
AH!! God!!!

01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:46.173
Tom! Tom! AH!

01:22:08.128 --> 01:22:10.364
Please!

01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:24.478
Please, wake up!

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.552
Wake up!

01:22:30.585 --> 01:22:32.986
Wake up...

01:22:44.566 --> 01:22:48.202
Over here!

01:22:50.572 --> 01:22:52.707
It's all right!

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.543
I'm here.

01:22:55.577 --> 01:22:57.177
It's all right.

01:24:42.182 --> 01:24:44.852
I nearly lost you, didn't I?

01:24:50.457 --> 01:24:52.560
You don't have to say it.

01:25:21.355 --> 01:25:24.291
Let's go.

01:25:43.778 --> 01:25:46.413
Are you coming?
