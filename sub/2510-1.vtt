00:55.481 --> 00:57.115
- Teddy?
- Hmm.

00:57.150 --> 00:59.450
If you were
in the olden times,
what would you do?

01:00.419 --> 01:02.253
Which olden times?

01:02.288 --> 01:04.989
Like, King Arthur,
with knights and horses
and shit.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.928
I'd be the king!
You can't be king, dog.
No way.

01:11.263 --> 01:13.165
Dude, if I went back,
I'd be the fucking king.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.366
I'd be the king.

01:17.436 --> 01:19.755
Then, I'd fuck every
virgin in the kingdom.

01:19.789 --> 01:22.040
No, you can't be
king, asshole. Okay?

01:22.708 --> 01:24.976
You can't even be duke.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.112
The fact that you
fucking said that
shows you're not royalty.

01:27.146 --> 01:28.280
You're a peasant.

01:28.747 --> 01:30.115
Peasant!

01:30.149 --> 01:32.150
Dude, but think about it.

01:32.185 --> 01:34.386
When people time travel,
they go back

01:34.420 --> 01:36.521
aren't they always the king,
or they know the king?

01:36.556 --> 01:39.458
But that's in stories.
In stories everybody's
going to be the king.

01:39.492 --> 01:42.194
It's Aristotle shit.
It's not real.

01:42.228 --> 01:45.030
Yeah, but neither
is time travel.

01:45.064 --> 01:47.733
There're very few fucking
kings and you wouldn't
be one of them, okay?

01:47.767 --> 01:49.300
King Teddy?

01:49.335 --> 01:52.003
King Teddy?
That's a fucking
turd's name, dude.

01:52.038 --> 01:54.039
Fuck you, Fred.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.941
Fuck you,
you're an idiot.
You're an idiot.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.375
I know.

01:59.461 --> 02:02.164
If you were king,
I'd fucking kill myself.

02:04.366 --> 02:06.735
Then you better die,
motherfucker,

02:06.769 --> 02:08.820
'cause I'm the king
around these parts.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.025
Fuck, Fred.

02:15.695 --> 02:17.345
Oh, shit!

02:17.380 --> 02:19.414
Whoo!

02:21.684 --> 02:24.553
That felt
so fucking good.
That felt so...

02:42.605 --> 02:44.172
Hey, April!

02:45.140 --> 02:46.441
Wanna join us?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.586
All right girls, circle up.

03:00.072 --> 03:01.072
Bring it in.

03:02.692 --> 03:04.242
Have a stretch.

03:04.276 --> 03:05.410
All right, on the ground.

03:08.514 --> 03:10.382
Oh, I'm so wet.

03:10.416 --> 03:12.350
Not in a good way, either.

03:12.384 --> 03:15.553
Mr. B's a hottie,
though.
Fuck, I know.

03:15.587 --> 03:18.874
Right?
Too bad he wants
to get it in with April!

03:18.908 --> 03:20.125
I know.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.711
No, he doesn't.
Why would you say that?

03:22.745 --> 03:24.545
You just went to have
a fucking cigarette
during practice!

03:24.580 --> 03:26.181
I said I was going
to the bathroom.

03:27.634 --> 03:29.601
I'd go for it, if I were you.

03:29.635 --> 03:32.053
Guys, it's so awkward.
I baby-sit his kid.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.421
So?

03:34.790 --> 03:37.742
I bet he makes a really
ugly face when he comes.

03:37.777 --> 03:39.794
You pervert!
No, I'm just saying...

03:39.828 --> 03:42.297
I bet it's like this.
He's like...

03:42.331 --> 03:45.533
All right girls!
Good practice.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.419
Oh, shit! You think
he heard what I said?

03:47.453 --> 03:50.522
Yeah, he saw you.
He's like, "Wait, that's
my face."

03:50.556 --> 03:52.491
April, can I talk
to you for a minute?

03:55.594 --> 03:57.762
Hey, you think
you can babysit
Michael on Saturday?

03:57.797 --> 03:59.114
I have a date.

04:01.383 --> 04:02.384
I don't know why I try.

04:03.352 --> 04:04.819
Dates are always stupid.

04:07.823 --> 04:10.625
Um, yeah,
I can babysit
on Saturday.

04:10.659 --> 04:11.659
Great.

04:12.311 --> 04:15.279
And I think you
should play striker.

04:16.516 --> 04:19.334
I know it's a lot
of responsibility,
lot of pressure,

04:19.368 --> 04:21.069
but you look really
good out there, so...

04:21.671 --> 04:22.671
Thanks.

04:23.473 --> 04:25.173
Great.

04:25.207 --> 04:26.258
So, I'll see you Saturday.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.242
Okay, yeah.

04:29.512 --> 04:30.512
Okay.

04:57.757 --> 04:58.757
Fred.
Hey.

05:00.643 --> 05:02.203
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

05:02.211 --> 05:03.378
Yeah, this place is dead.

05:05.581 --> 05:07.816
Teddy, what would
you do if you got
into a car accident?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.484
Uh, I'd be pissed.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.586
If it was a drunk
driving accident,

05:11.620 --> 05:13.388
and you were the
one that was drunk?

05:14.523 --> 05:15.991
How bad is the accident?

05:16.025 --> 05:19.494
It's bad, you crashed
right into another car,
but your car still runs.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.363
Shit.
And the other person
could be dead,

05:21.397 --> 05:24.699
or they could just be
a little whiplashed
but you don't know.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.933
Who is the person?
You don't know, man!
That's the point.

05:26.936 --> 05:30.839
You can either wait around
and the other person
could be April

05:30.873 --> 05:32.890
and you two could
fall in love, or you can get
the fuck out of there.

05:32.925 --> 05:34.726
Either way
you have to decide.
Pretend like it happened now.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.394
Boom! That's the accident.

05:36.429 --> 05:38.430
What would you do?
I drive away.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.198
Drive away?
Yeah.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.353
You fucking drive away?
Yeah.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.667
That's your final answer?

05:42.701 --> 05:43.701
Yeah, dude.

05:44.604 --> 05:46.704
Shit, you got
issues, nigger.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.611
Hi, Meatball. Hi.

05:54.446 --> 05:56.681
I know.
Did you miss me?
Come here.

05:59.819 --> 06:01.686
Oh, hi, silly pretty thing.

06:01.721 --> 06:02.721
Hey, Stewart.

06:05.391 --> 06:06.831
Get that terrible rodent
out of here.

06:16.953 --> 06:19.420
Were you playing video games?

06:19.455 --> 06:20.655
Shooting hookers?

06:22.591 --> 06:24.860
Yes.
Brilliant.

06:28.664 --> 06:32.216
Oh, speaking of brilliant.
I corrected your paper.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.405
I called it
"Alexander the Dubious."

06:41.477 --> 06:43.411
You could have
just corrected it,

06:43.445 --> 06:45.680
you didn't have
to rewrite the whole thing.

06:45.715 --> 06:46.715
Yeah, well.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.218
It needed quite a bit
of work, sweetie.

06:52.021 --> 06:53.354
Okay.

06:53.889 --> 06:55.223
Thanks.

06:56.175 --> 06:57.292
Bye.

06:58.894 --> 07:01.729
What happened
with your colonoscopy
today? Are you okay?

07:03.032 --> 07:04.966
Yeah, hold on a minute.
April's here.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.335
I just wanna say hi to her,
will you hold on for a sec?

07:07.369 --> 07:09.770
Hi.
Hi, honey. How are you?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.622
Yeah, I'm good.
Just kind of tired.

07:11.656 --> 07:13.708
I'm gonna go lie down
for a little.

07:13.742 --> 07:14.742
You look tired.

07:16.696 --> 07:17.963
Just said that.

07:17.997 --> 07:21.082
You really need to rest.
Are you depressed?

07:21.117 --> 07:22.801
No, why do you always
ask me if I'm depressed?

07:22.835 --> 07:24.436
I'm not depressed.
I'm tired.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.405
All right.
I love you.

07:28.891 --> 07:30.971
Okay, Jamal, I'm gonna
call you back in a little bit.

07:40.736 --> 07:42.703
I don't care. Tsk.

07:42.738 --> 07:43.804
Whatever!

07:43.839 --> 07:45.573
You don't wanna talk to me?

07:45.607 --> 07:47.541
I don't wanna talk to you first.

07:47.576 --> 07:49.377
And I'm not doing that paper.

07:49.411 --> 07:50.946
'Cause I don't give a fuck.

07:50.980 --> 07:52.463
This is what I think.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.666
Later.

07:56.468 --> 07:58.469
No one even cares
'cause you're fat.

08:05.744 --> 08:08.897
<i>What is</i>
<i>this homework?</i>
<i>It's algebra.</i>

08:08.931 --> 08:11.799
Phew, I would never
be able to do that.
How do you do that?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.969
Because I have to.

08:14.003 --> 08:16.972
<i>My little baby!
I'm not a baby.</i>

08:17.006 --> 08:19.741
You're such
a little baby.
Mmm-mmm.

08:19.775 --> 08:21.843
You are.
You need to relax
and rest.

08:31.503 --> 08:33.736
Okay, so everyone knows
how to play, right?

08:33.772 --> 08:36.924
You just say,
"Never have I ever..."

08:36.958 --> 08:39.961
And then if you've done
the thing you have to drink.

08:39.995 --> 08:43.431
Like if you say,
"I've never cheated
on my boyfriend"

08:43.465 --> 08:46.885
and you have cheated
on your boyfriend,
then you have to drink!

08:46.919 --> 08:51.589
Um, never have
I ever given Seth Monkarsh
a blow-job

08:51.624 --> 08:54.376
during free period
in the senior parking lot.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.793
Uh-oh.
Drink up, Chrissy.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.030
Yup.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.868
Okay fine, my turn.
Um, hmm.

09:03.902 --> 09:06.371
Never have I ever...

09:08.807 --> 09:10.341
Kissed my uncle.

09:10.376 --> 09:11.726
What?

09:11.761 --> 09:14.562
Are you fucking serious?
That was private.

09:17.532 --> 09:19.400
Fucking freak.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.875
Hey, April.
Hey, Teddy. Oh!

10:02.979 --> 10:04.245
You all right there?

10:04.280 --> 10:05.947
The chair's broken.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.151
Do you need a light?
Sure.

10:15.274 --> 10:16.807
Thanks.

10:21.963 --> 10:23.247
Why are you doing that?

10:23.281 --> 10:25.733
Would you mind
your own business?
These are my stepbrother's.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.836
Not like they're
fucking working anyway.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.792
This party sucks.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.949
Do you wanna go over
to the graves for a bit?

10:42.718 --> 10:43.718
Yeah.

10:44.536 --> 10:46.237
Do you wanna come?

10:46.272 --> 10:47.872
Sure.

10:50.109 --> 10:52.010
Never have I ever

10:52.044 --> 10:56.114
had a lesbianic experience.

11:01.136 --> 11:02.503
I've never been in love.

11:03.539 --> 11:04.873
I think it's bullshit.

11:13.165 --> 11:14.732
I stole
your lamp shade.

11:18.670 --> 11:19.970
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna fall.

11:27.629 --> 11:30.164
Oh, my God!

11:30.199 --> 11:32.867
Ah, I got you guys.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.038
It's uncool dude,
there could be ghosts
around here.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.240
Jesus.
Don't even say that.

11:39.274 --> 11:42.009
Hey, you guys remember
that kid in eighth grade
who suicided himself?

11:42.044 --> 11:43.644
Yeah, that's...
I remember that.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.747
The Asian kid?
Yeah.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.117
Why do you think
he killed himself?

11:49.151 --> 11:51.219
He's buried here.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.856
I think he killed himself
because he was Asian.
I think it's pretty obvious.

11:54.890 --> 11:57.558
What does that even mean?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.227
It means his parents
pressured the shit
out of him

11:59.261 --> 12:00.962
because he was Asian, duh?

12:02.631 --> 12:05.599
I don't think that's true.

12:05.634 --> 12:08.669
I don't really think
you know any better than me,
so no point talking.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.055
Okay.

12:11.089 --> 12:12.123
You got it.
Oh, shit!

12:12.892 --> 12:14.708
Whoo!

12:20.449 --> 12:21.449
Stop!

12:22.351 --> 12:24.085
My parents
are gonna fucking flip.

12:25.004 --> 12:26.004
Wow.

12:29.742 --> 12:31.709
It's kind of hard.

12:31.744 --> 12:33.011
That's what she said.

12:34.146 --> 12:35.146
It's cool looking.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.051
Ted, check this out.

12:47.343 --> 12:48.709
Be careful.

12:54.766 --> 12:57.101
Do you think it hurts
shooting yourself?

12:57.136 --> 12:59.404
Probably for a second.

12:59.438 --> 13:03.808
But, er, I think
pain only hurts
if it's prolonged.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.125
If I was going to kill myself,

13:08.397 --> 13:10.148
I'd kill a bunch
of other people
and take 'em down with me.

13:10.182 --> 13:11.131
I wouldn't waste it.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.466
Why would you do that?

13:12.501 --> 13:15.369
Why wouldn't you do
like a bunch of really
crazy good things

13:15.404 --> 13:20.208
you know, like help people
or save kids or something.

13:20.242 --> 13:24.245
I think when you're suicidal,
though, you're probably only
thinking about yourself.

13:24.279 --> 13:27.932
I don't know.
I try to be good.

13:27.966 --> 13:30.218
Fuck good, guys.
Fuck good.

13:30.970 --> 13:32.136
Live the dangerous life.

13:41.763 --> 13:43.198
Where have you been?

13:43.232 --> 13:46.000
Listen. I asked Tyler
if he'd go out with me.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.508
And either he
didn't hear me or he...

13:48.737 --> 13:50.705
I don't know why he would...

14:08.157 --> 14:09.190
Whoo!

14:58.373 --> 15:01.742
<i>Where'd April go?</i>
<i>Are you still hung up</i>
<i>on April, dude?</i>

15:01.777 --> 15:02.977
<i>Get over it.</i>

15:04.513 --> 15:05.980
<i>Be strong.</i>

15:06.414 --> 15:07.982
<i>Be strong.</i>

15:15.140 --> 15:16.206
Bye!

15:26.885 --> 15:28.753
You okay?
Shut up.

15:31.456 --> 15:32.857
Did you get it all out?

15:33.458 --> 15:34.759
Shut up.

15:37.295 --> 15:38.562
Do you want some water?

15:38.597 --> 15:39.997
Mouthwash.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.834
Okay, come on.
It's in the bathroom.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.038
Oh, yeah!

15:50.959 --> 15:53.294
<i>♪ And the boring days
are like clockwork ♪</i>

16:00.035 --> 16:01.802
What's up, April?

16:02.571 --> 16:05.272
How you doing?
Good.

16:05.306 --> 16:07.274
Nice.

16:07.308 --> 16:10.912
I like your skirt or dress,
I don't know what it is.

16:10.946 --> 16:12.312
But it's really pretty.

16:13.314 --> 16:14.749
Thanks.

16:14.783 --> 16:18.419
The color brings out your eyes
or something, it's really...
I like it.

16:18.453 --> 16:20.070
It's tight.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.373
Even your moccasins,
those are awesome also.

16:23.925 --> 16:25.576
Just got it all going on.

16:25.610 --> 16:26.828
Thanks.

16:27.629 --> 16:29.563
You enjoying the party?

16:29.598 --> 16:32.200
Yeah, it's fun.

16:32.234 --> 16:34.068
You know what
your outfit's missing?

16:35.404 --> 16:38.322
Is this hat.
I think it'd complete it.

16:38.357 --> 16:41.259
Actually... You look good
as is, actually.

16:45.330 --> 16:48.199
You're raging tonight
or you're just
kind of chilling?

16:48.233 --> 16:50.234
Raging.
We're going off, huh?

16:50.269 --> 16:51.502
Yeah.

16:51.537 --> 16:53.037
I'm asking...

16:55.407 --> 16:57.208
Do you want to do a shot
or something?

16:57.242 --> 16:59.843
Yeah, cheers to that.
Let's go grab one.
Wow.

17:00.345 --> 17:01.345
Whoo.

18:26.681 --> 18:28.015
Oh, fuck!

18:37.643 --> 18:39.943
Have you seen April around here?

18:42.046 --> 18:43.547
She's right there, man.

19:02.217 --> 19:04.251
Fred, let's get
the fuck out of here, man.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.254
Hey Teddy, where are we going?

19:07.756 --> 19:09.223
Fucking nowhere.

19:10.676 --> 19:13.010
On a scale of one to baked,
how baked are you?

19:13.645 --> 19:15.262
Fucking baked!

19:19.584 --> 19:21.151
What the fuck?

19:25.306 --> 19:26.607
What the fuck was that?

19:27.826 --> 19:29.560
Dude, what the fuck
are you doing?

19:32.113 --> 19:34.348
How the fuck
did you know?
How did I know what?

19:34.383 --> 19:35.750
How did you know I'd get
in a fucking accident?

19:35.784 --> 19:37.551
I didn't.
What do you mean
how did I know?

19:37.586 --> 19:39.119
What if, yeah, what if?

19:39.153 --> 19:41.221
Just stop, stop.
Let me out.

19:44.393 --> 19:47.077
Teddy, you're not
really blaming me
for this, are you?

19:47.613 --> 19:48.613
Really?

19:51.450 --> 19:52.450
I'll see ya.

19:57.288 --> 20:00.157
You know,
you're being
kind of a dick.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.442
Fuck.

20:34.476 --> 20:36.477
- That's him, Officer.
- Okay.

20:37.512 --> 20:38.612
That's definitely the car.

20:43.685 --> 20:46.287
Okay, it seems like you're
the one I'm looking for.

20:46.289 --> 20:47.871
Someone called
your plates in, buddy.

20:47.906 --> 20:49.256
Can I see your license?

20:53.762 --> 20:55.802
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

20:57.749 --> 20:59.750
To the front of the car,
over there.

20:59.785 --> 21:01.418
Now face this way.

21:01.452 --> 21:02.452
It's a kid.

21:03.821 --> 21:06.073
Walk in a straight line.
I can't do that.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.510
Okay, then recite
the alphabet backwards
from Z to A.

21:10.545 --> 21:12.346
Backwards?
Yes.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.699
Can't do that shit.
Why don't you try?

21:14.733 --> 21:17.267
Oh. See, we got
a wise one here, huh?

21:17.319 --> 21:18.486
I'm not fucking wise, Chip.

21:19.554 --> 21:21.371
I just can't recite
my alphabet backwards.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.857
Can't even do that shit sober.

21:22.891 --> 21:24.525
Listen, smart ass.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.677
You can either do
the sobriety test,

21:26.712 --> 21:28.762
or I can take you
to the hospital
and you can do a blood test.

21:28.797 --> 21:29.797
What do you wanna do?

21:31.499 --> 21:37.287
Y-X-Z... F-U-C-K U!
U! U! U!

21:37.322 --> 21:38.889
U, U!

21:38.923 --> 21:40.958
You have the right
to remain silent.
Fuck you.

21:40.992 --> 21:42.977
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a
court of law.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.344
Do you understand that?

21:44.379 --> 21:46.146
You have the right
to an attorney.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.615
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed
for you.

21:47.649 --> 21:49.700
Do you understand these rights?

21:49.735 --> 21:50.735
Fuck you.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.170
- Yeah, fuck you, too.
- Hey!

21:55.223 --> 21:57.207
Put your head down.

21:57.241 --> 21:58.676
Oh, my God.
Fucking pig!

23:13.802 --> 23:14.802
Oh!

23:16.021 --> 23:19.490
Holy fucking shit!
What?

23:19.524 --> 23:22.309
No fucking way,
this is too good.
What is it?

23:22.344 --> 23:23.711
How do we not know about this?

23:23.745 --> 23:25.312
What is it?

23:25.346 --> 23:27.514
Do you know
that Emily has a blog?

23:27.548 --> 23:29.883
You're kidding me.
Holy shit!
Look at these pictures.

23:30.969 --> 23:32.469
Who does that?

23:33.788 --> 23:37.807
Emily blew Teddy last night
in your parents' bedroom.

23:39.477 --> 23:41.445
You're lying.
Mmm-mmm.

23:41.479 --> 23:43.313
- How do you know that?
- Seth told me.

23:43.348 --> 23:44.381
How gross is that?

23:45.050 --> 23:47.617
In my parents' bedroom?

23:47.652 --> 23:50.854
She will suck
any dick that anyone
puts in her face.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.289
God almighty!

23:55.426 --> 23:56.526
She's going down.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.764
What are you playing?

24:17.798 --> 24:19.433
<i>Doodle.</i>

24:19.467 --> 24:21.035
What's that?

24:21.069 --> 24:23.803
It's just like you
have to get the turtle
to the other side.

24:57.455 --> 24:59.322
Come on, enough of this game.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.692
Let's watch a movie.

25:15.740 --> 25:18.441
I don't think I'm allowed
to watch this movie.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.877
Why? It's a good movie.

25:31.890 --> 25:32.890
Whoa.

25:37.812 --> 25:41.332
Okay, I think you're right.
It's time for bed, okay?

25:41.366 --> 25:44.535
I don't wanna go to bed.
I like this movie.

25:44.569 --> 25:46.870
I bet you do.
Come on, let's go.
Bed time.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.451
<i>I want us to be able
to be friends.</i>

26:01.486 --> 26:03.937
<i>I always asked you
to hang out and like...</i>

26:08.943 --> 26:12.479
<i>A back area and like,
hang out there with, like...</i>

26:12.513 --> 26:13.747
Hey.
Hi.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.903
What are you watching?

26:21.773 --> 26:23.173
I don't know.
Some reality show.

26:23.207 --> 26:24.675
Ah.

26:26.544 --> 26:28.879
Well, that was a shitty date.

26:30.915 --> 26:31.915
What happened?

26:33.918 --> 26:34.918
Nothing.

26:36.654 --> 26:39.990
Just like always.
Teachers are so boring.

26:41.959 --> 26:45.662
I can't believe you guys
have to sit there
and listen them all day.

26:45.697 --> 26:47.664
At least I can go home.

26:47.699 --> 26:50.567
Yeah. Well, I don't
really listen to them.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.703
Oh, really?

26:53.772 --> 26:56.573
You don't listen to me?

26:56.608 --> 26:58.509
I didn't mean you.
Of course
I listen to you.

26:58.543 --> 26:59.810
Yeah, you better.

27:11.555 --> 27:12.823
Well, I should go.

27:18.829 --> 27:19.829
Sorry.

27:23.034 --> 27:24.568
Bye.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.503
Well, thanks again,
I really appreciate it.

27:27.071 --> 27:28.071
Sure.

27:30.141 --> 27:31.475
See you at practice.

27:49.593 --> 27:51.662
I'm dizzy.
Emma, sit down.

27:51.696 --> 27:52.829
Why?
Come on.

27:57.268 --> 27:58.668
- Teddy Morrison.
- Yeah.

28:02.606 --> 28:03.974
Hey, are you in trouble?

28:10.314 --> 28:13.249
<i>Mr. Morrison,</i>
<i>this is the second time you've</i>
<i>been before the court.</i>

28:14.969 --> 28:17.304
<i>Given the support
you have from your family,</i>

28:17.338 --> 28:19.072
<i>from the school
and the community,</i>

28:19.106 --> 28:23.109
<i>the court would like</i>
<i>to give you one last chance</i>
<i>to turn your life around.</i>

28:23.144 --> 28:24.878
<i>In lieu of commitment,</i>

28:24.912 --> 28:28.131
<i>you shall be placed</i>
<i>on probation for a period</i>
<i>of 12 months</i>

28:28.165 --> 28:30.701
<i>on the following terms
and conditions.</i>

28:30.735 --> 28:37.791
<i>One, you shall perform</i>
<i>150 hours of community service</i>
<i>at the children's library.</i>

28:37.825 --> 28:42.362
<i>Given your demonstrated talent</i>
<i>as an artist and painter</i>
<i>I think you'll do quite well.</i>

28:42.397 --> 28:46.899
<i>Two, you must make a formal</i>
<i>and in person apology</i>
<i>to Mrs. Grossman,</i>

28:46.934 --> 28:49.603
<i>the victim of the offense
and whose car you hit.</i>

28:51.239 --> 28:56.109
<i>Mr. Morrison, if you fail</i>
<i>to complete your</i>
<i>community service hours</i>

28:56.143 --> 28:59.663
<i>or if you engage</i>
<i>in any further criminal</i>

28:59.697 --> 29:03.716
<i>your probation will be revoked</i>
<i>and you will be committed</i>
<i>to juvenile hall.</i>

29:05.085 --> 29:06.953
<i>All right,
thank you and good luck.</i>

29:16.897 --> 29:18.331
Teddy, can you help me?

29:18.366 --> 29:19.832
Yeah.

29:19.867 --> 29:21.635
Emma, get your shoes.

29:30.862 --> 29:32.362
I Love you, Mom.
I love you, too, honey.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.830
Really sorry about all this.

29:33.865 --> 29:35.425
Don't forget to apologize
to that woman.

29:37.851 --> 29:39.252
Try not to hang around Fred.

29:42.006 --> 29:43.206
Love you, Mom.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.888
Hey, Teddy, look what I can do.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.192
Yeah. Get out of my room!

30:04.578 --> 30:05.812
Could you get out of my room?

30:07.014 --> 30:08.014
Get out.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.704
He's cute.
Give me some of that.

30:14.739 --> 30:16.005
He's not cute.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.040
Fred?

30:17.708 --> 30:20.009
Yes, he is.
He's horrible looking.

30:20.044 --> 30:23.079
No, he's cute.
You think everyone's cute.

30:23.113 --> 30:24.113
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

30:25.934 --> 30:27.868
And this is how
you didn't make a basket.

30:27.902 --> 30:30.320
Dude, chill the fuck out!

30:30.355 --> 30:33.106
Basketball, you know how
to play basketball? It's how
you play on the streets.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.023
Fuck you!
What the fuck, Fred?

30:34.058 --> 30:35.191
Call it, bitch.

30:35.225 --> 30:37.293
I fucking am.
Oh, you are a bitch?

30:37.328 --> 30:39.295
No, I'm calling
a fucking foul.
You play dirty.

30:39.330 --> 30:41.164
Oh, I play dirty?
I play dirty?

30:41.198 --> 30:43.049
Yeah, you fucking do
and you need to chill.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.151
Ladies, ladies.
Do you think I play dirty?

30:45.186 --> 30:47.087
Do you think I play dirty?

30:47.121 --> 30:48.955
Jacko, you think I play dirty?

30:50.324 --> 30:51.892
Yeah, kind of.

30:51.926 --> 30:54.761
What the fuck?
You're on my team.

30:54.795 --> 30:57.364
This isn't
powder puff football.
This isn't two hand touch.

30:57.398 --> 30:59.199
Let's just play.
Chill out. God!

31:02.770 --> 31:04.304
Real fucking tough.

31:04.338 --> 31:06.890
Fucking cheese dicks.
Enjoy your fucking game.

31:10.878 --> 31:12.128
See ya.
Fuck you, mama boy.

31:17.151 --> 31:20.987
Hey, ladies, I wanna
apologize for my bad
language back there.

31:24.075 --> 31:25.341
How's the smoking?

31:25.376 --> 31:26.493
Fucking fine.

31:26.527 --> 31:28.278
Mmm.

31:28.313 --> 31:30.113
Can I try some of that
fucking fine cigarette?

31:38.890 --> 31:40.790
That is fucking fine.
You want it back?

31:41.408 --> 31:42.875
No?

31:42.910 --> 31:44.945
You know what
bugs me about you, Pam?

31:46.664 --> 31:48.532
You remind me
of a praying mantis.

31:48.566 --> 31:50.483
You're all long and mantis like

31:50.652 --> 31:53.904
and it just really
gets on my nerve
because, you know...

31:53.938 --> 31:55.405
How am I supposed to know
if you're a girl
or a praying mantis?

31:55.439 --> 31:56.990
I wanna go, Emily.

31:57.024 --> 31:58.224
Don't go.
Did I offend you?

31:58.259 --> 31:59.326
Fuck you.
Are you coming?

32:00.795 --> 32:02.315
I don't think she wants
to go with you.

32:02.330 --> 32:04.063
Sorry. She wants
to stay. Emily?

32:06.900 --> 32:07.834
I think I'm gonna stay.

32:07.868 --> 32:09.102
Yeah!

32:09.137 --> 32:10.837
Fuck you guys.

32:10.871 --> 32:13.031
Fuck you. Go eat
some more of your
fucking mates, bitch!

32:16.527 --> 32:17.527
Sorry, I...

32:19.864 --> 32:21.931
Guess I kind of
ruined your friendship.

32:21.965 --> 32:23.966
She wasn't
really a friend.
Just a girl.

32:28.039 --> 32:29.039
<i>Wanna get out of here?</i>

32:29.574 --> 32:30.574
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:32.476 --> 32:34.343
<i>Do you wanna</i>
<i>come over?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:38.866 --> 32:40.150
Whoa!

32:40.918 --> 32:42.385
Emily's room.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.786
Do you like it?

32:45.923 --> 32:47.483
Hey, you got a lot
of shit in your room.

32:47.659 --> 32:48.659
Yeah.

32:49.961 --> 32:50.961
What's this?

32:51.562 --> 32:53.396
That's my headband.

32:53.431 --> 32:54.897
Do I look sexy?
Second grade.

32:54.932 --> 32:55.999
Yo, what's up?

33:00.972 --> 33:02.438
Where's Teddy?

33:02.473 --> 33:05.241
Why does everybody
always ask about
Teddy, seriously?

33:05.275 --> 33:06.893
I don't know.
You're always with him.

33:08.212 --> 33:09.913
He follows me around.
What am I supposed to do?

33:09.947 --> 33:11.314
I'm not a rude person.

33:13.951 --> 33:15.118
Is that your guitar?

33:15.653 --> 33:17.020
Yeah.

33:17.054 --> 33:18.371
I don't know how
to play it, though.

33:18.405 --> 33:19.573
Can I play?

33:19.607 --> 33:21.274
Yeah. Do you know how?

33:21.308 --> 33:24.077
Yeah, fucking master of guitar.

33:24.111 --> 33:25.111
Virtuoso.

33:46.651 --> 33:48.185
I wrote that for you.
Will you teach
me how to play?

33:48.219 --> 33:49.452
Do you wanna know
how to play guitar?

33:49.487 --> 33:50.887
All right, here we go.

33:52.022 --> 33:53.323
Lesson 101, G-chord.

33:54.058 --> 33:55.225
Put your fingers here.

33:55.959 --> 33:57.394
One finger here.

33:58.663 --> 33:59.996
One finger here.

34:00.698 --> 34:02.399
One finger here.

34:03.401 --> 34:04.867
Right. Now strum.

34:06.937 --> 34:08.036
That was not that bad.

34:09.574 --> 34:11.474
Now, here's the second lesson.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.344
Put...

34:20.685 --> 34:22.118
Do you like building forts?

34:25.356 --> 34:26.356
Sure.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.995
What?

34:49.030 --> 34:50.163
I don't know
what that is.

34:50.197 --> 34:52.998
A butterfly kiss.
Your mom never gave you those?

34:53.034 --> 34:54.951
Mom never gave
me a butterfly kiss.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.320
All right.

35:00.691 --> 35:02.158
Where you going?

35:02.192 --> 35:03.293
What do you mean?

35:03.661 --> 35:05.028
You leaving?

35:05.062 --> 35:06.062
Yeah.

35:08.699 --> 35:09.699
It was fun.

35:11.235 --> 35:12.235
Was it good?

35:13.471 --> 35:14.471
Yeah.

35:16.340 --> 35:17.407
It was good.

35:21.045 --> 35:22.078
Will you call me?

35:22.547 --> 35:23.547
Uh-huh.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.083
Cool. All right.

35:28.218 --> 35:29.453
Peace out.
I'll see you around.

35:31.355 --> 35:33.055
Bye.
Yeah, whatever.

35:47.888 --> 35:49.238
...his arm
and that's the claw.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.057
And these are
gonna be tentacles.

35:51.091 --> 35:52.024
Oh, good.
Great job.

35:52.059 --> 35:53.843
Like a man-octopus.

35:53.877 --> 35:55.211
And this is...

35:55.246 --> 35:56.279
That's...
That's the head.

35:57.548 --> 35:59.015
Like a melon.

35:59.049 --> 36:00.249
Well, it's like a cantaloupe.

36:00.284 --> 36:01.751
Well, draw a cantaloupe
and I'm...

36:01.786 --> 36:05.121
I wanna see... Draw a
cantaloupe and I wanna see
how it looks compared to...

36:05.155 --> 36:06.523
I'll do it but
I don't get it.
Okay.

36:06.557 --> 36:07.557
Okay.

36:11.462 --> 36:12.462
You draw fast.

36:13.580 --> 36:14.580
You draw really fast.

36:16.149 --> 36:19.369
You know, Picasso drew fast.

36:19.403 --> 36:20.763
He could draw a dove
in 16 seconds.

36:22.807 --> 36:25.074
Sixteen seconds.
You know the dove?

36:25.108 --> 36:26.376
Uh, yeah, the doves are great.

36:26.410 --> 36:28.311
They are great.

36:28.346 --> 36:33.282
But, you know, to do
it in 16 seconds it
took six decades of practice.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.035
Technical skill
is not enough.
It's never enough.

36:37.337 --> 36:39.689
He had to master the masters

36:39.723 --> 36:41.007
before he was able

36:42.276 --> 36:44.060
to abandon what he learned

36:44.094 --> 36:45.294
and become Picasso.

36:46.546 --> 36:49.181
You know, you remind
me of Sylvester Stallone.

36:49.216 --> 36:50.783
What?
Yeah.

36:50.818 --> 36:52.251
He's a very good artist.

36:52.286 --> 36:56.306
Underneath all that
muscle, you know,
he's a very smart dude.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.209
And, you know, he wrote <i> Rocky.</i>

37:01.495 --> 37:04.615
I mean, he wrote <i> Rocky,</i>
he wrote all four of <i> Rocky.</i>
I mean, that dude's smart.

37:29.589 --> 37:30.589
What?

37:53.581 --> 37:54.581
Yeah.

38:08.613 --> 38:09.613
April.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.280
Hey, Coach.

38:12.516 --> 38:14.283
What're you doing
sitting in that locker.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.221
I don't know.
I just like it sometimes.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.495
Surprised you can fit in there.

38:21.425 --> 38:22.425
I guess.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.894
Wow.

38:24.929 --> 38:28.648
Is everything okay?
I haven't seen you at
practice past couple of days.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.150
Yeah, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

38:30.184 --> 38:33.853
I just... I fell behind
on a bunch of schoolwork
so I've been catching up.

38:33.855 --> 38:36.372
Mmm-hmm.
I promise I'll be
there next week.

38:37.274 --> 38:38.574
Do I still get to play?

38:40.411 --> 38:44.213
Yeah. I just
wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

38:44.248 --> 38:46.928
You know you can talk
to me, right? That's part
of what a coach does.

38:47.801 --> 38:49.602
Okay.

38:49.636 --> 38:52.371
If you need help with
homework, I'm pretty
good at that, too.

38:53.207 --> 38:55.308
Yeah, sure.

38:55.342 --> 38:58.611
Why don't you just bring
your schoolwork to my house
when you babysit next time?

38:59.546 --> 39:01.280
Okay, I will. Mmm-hmm.
Yeah?

39:03.350 --> 39:05.284
So, I'll see
you at practice?
Yeah, I promise.

39:06.420 --> 39:07.687
I will.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.189
Promise? Okay.
Promise.

39:11.925 --> 39:12.925
Don't get stuck in there.

39:15.913 --> 39:18.748
I'm really sorry about
what happened. I can't...

39:18.782 --> 39:20.850
Oh, Teddy, Teddy.
What I did.

39:20.885 --> 39:23.369
There's... There's no
need to apologize.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.305
No, I...
No. No, there isn't.

39:25.339 --> 39:26.339
And do you know why?

39:26.673 --> 39:27.940
Why?

39:27.975 --> 39:29.442
Because you have a problem.

39:30.311 --> 39:31.444
You're an alcoholic.

39:33.514 --> 39:34.914
But you know that, right?

39:34.948 --> 39:36.583
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

39:36.617 --> 39:40.019
I mean, it's getting
to be such a problem now,
I just...

39:40.054 --> 39:42.554
See, that's good
that he knows that.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.959
That I understand that.
The reason I can spot
people like you

39:45.993 --> 39:48.978
is because I have
a problem, too. Eating.

39:49.012 --> 39:53.816
And in some way,
your problem is much easier
to solve than my problem

39:53.851 --> 39:58.320
because I have temptation
at least three times a day.
And...

39:58.355 --> 40:01.391
Thing is if you're
an alcoholic and you know
you're an alcoholic

40:01.425 --> 40:04.727
and you don't do something
about being that,
you're an asshole.

40:05.745 --> 40:06.930
That's a little much.

40:06.964 --> 40:08.881
We're talking about
alcohol here...

40:08.915 --> 40:11.434
Right.
We're talking about
a slightly different

40:11.468 --> 40:14.737
set of circumstances from
getting a Whitman sampler

40:14.771 --> 40:17.707
and eating every
single chocolate in there.

40:17.741 --> 40:20.981
You know, I don't really...
You know what, I really don't
appreciate your attitude.

40:26.817 --> 40:28.568
Hello.

40:28.602 --> 40:30.036
I'm, uh, here for
the community service.

40:30.070 --> 40:31.871
Oh, you must be Teddy.
Yeah, I am.

40:31.905 --> 40:33.756
We're so happy to have you.

40:33.790 --> 40:36.659
Great.
Come on over
and I'll show you around.

41:21.972 --> 41:24.907
Twenty two, 13...
Where are you 22.13?
Hey.

41:25.843 --> 41:27.409
Hey!

41:27.444 --> 41:29.779
You know what?
I'm really
liking it here.

41:29.813 --> 41:31.948
We really like you.
And you know what?

41:31.982 --> 41:34.684
You can always come back
even after all this is over.

41:35.819 --> 41:37.453
Right on.
Okay.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.402
Hello.

41:52.436 --> 41:54.003
Dude, Fred, you can't be here.

41:54.037 --> 41:55.037
Why not? I miss you.

41:56.156 --> 41:57.356
'Cause I'm working.

41:57.991 --> 41:58.991
Yeah, right.

42:00.027 --> 42:01.027
What're you doing?

42:01.494 --> 42:02.494
What's this?

42:03.030 --> 42:04.964
<i>Rainbow Gremlins.</i>

42:04.998 --> 42:07.734
It's tight.
Used to be my favorite.

42:07.768 --> 42:09.902
This shit is stupid.
This book is your favorite?
Yeah.

42:10.854 --> 42:11.854
Faggot.

42:14.441 --> 42:15.975
Holy shit!
Rainbow Gremlins were gay.

42:16.009 --> 42:17.042
Dude...
They were fucking gay.

42:17.077 --> 42:18.043
Shut up. You gotta
keep it down.

42:18.078 --> 42:19.798
Dude, they sucked
the juice out of rainbows.

42:19.813 --> 42:21.046
Shut up.
We're in a library, man.

42:21.081 --> 42:22.615
They sucked the juice
out of rainbows.

42:22.650 --> 42:23.849
Rainbows are gay, get it?

42:24.885 --> 42:26.469
So?

42:26.503 --> 42:28.770
Don't get all
defensive about it.
It's just a fact.

42:28.805 --> 42:30.240
You and the Rainbow Gremlins
are gay as fuck.

42:30.274 --> 42:31.707
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

42:31.741 --> 42:32.792
They're a bunch of dudes

42:32.826 --> 42:34.760
and they just hang
out all the time,
all together.

42:34.795 --> 42:36.612
That' all they do.
Just fucking hang out.

42:36.646 --> 42:37.981
It's exactly what we do.

42:40.768 --> 42:42.501
What're you...
No. Fred?

42:46.073 --> 42:47.373
You can't do that, dude.

42:49.042 --> 42:50.143
Dude, look.
No...

42:50.177 --> 42:51.177
Pubes.

42:59.069 --> 43:01.437
That was
really trippy, man.

43:01.471 --> 43:04.473
It's like, think of all
the people that fucking
died from eating mushrooms

43:04.507 --> 43:06.609
before they discovered
the psychedelic ones.

43:07.077 --> 43:08.410
What do you mean?

43:08.445 --> 43:11.180
Like, think about all
the people that, like,
just ate mushrooms

43:11.214 --> 43:13.815
<i>until they found the one
that gets you all fucked up.</i>

43:13.850 --> 43:15.634
Hey, man, let's just
try this mushroom.
See if it gets...

43:15.668 --> 43:17.003
This is fucking
cow shit all over it.

43:17.037 --> 43:18.737
What're you saying?

43:18.771 --> 43:21.507
Isn't it cow shit
that makes you high
from the mushroom?

43:21.541 --> 43:22.741
I don't know.
I think it helps.

43:24.945 --> 43:28.614
<i>Hey, you got anything
going on later?</i>

43:28.649 --> 43:30.183
<i>You wanna go do something?</i>

43:30.217 --> 43:31.150
<i>Can we go do something now?</i>

43:31.185 --> 43:33.186
<i>Can't.
Gotta finish this off.</i>

43:33.220 --> 43:34.654
<i>Get it.</i>

43:34.688 --> 43:35.688
<i>What do you mean?</i>

43:36.657 --> 43:37.937
This is the one
day I can't, man.

43:38.158 --> 43:39.525
Sorry.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.194
What am I supposed to do?

43:41.228 --> 43:42.895
I don't know.

43:42.929 --> 43:44.029
Dude, I don't even wanna
hang out with you.

43:44.064 --> 43:45.698
You're boring as shit.

43:45.733 --> 43:47.013
All you do is fucking
work and...

43:48.669 --> 43:49.669
Fuck that shit.

44:13.677 --> 44:14.960
All right.

44:14.995 --> 44:17.997
Step one for doing
homework is
turning off your phone.

44:18.765 --> 44:20.232
Fine.
Okay.

44:20.266 --> 44:21.867
Now, it's simple.

44:21.902 --> 44:25.037
The way to write a good
history paper is to

44:25.072 --> 44:27.707
choose your event
and then just explain
why it happened.

44:27.741 --> 44:32.111
History is just explaining
why things happened.

44:32.145 --> 44:34.880
But what if I don't
think there's a reason
for something happening?

44:36.183 --> 44:38.250
Well, then you need
to think harder.

44:38.284 --> 44:41.220
Yeah, but I do things all
the time for no reason.

44:41.254 --> 44:43.723
Mmm-hmm.
It's because you're young.

44:43.757 --> 44:46.759
And you don't know
why you do things
but there's always a reason.

44:49.763 --> 44:50.863
No?
Mmm-mmm.

44:51.297 --> 44:52.998
Okay.

44:53.033 --> 44:57.136
I mean, if you wanted to,
couldn't you just say that the
reason everything's happened

44:57.170 --> 45:00.672
is because of one thing that
happened at the very, very,
very beginning of time.

45:00.707 --> 45:02.975
Mmm-hmm. If you wanted
to be a smart-ass.

45:19.242 --> 45:20.242
Sorry.

45:23.029 --> 45:24.029
That's okay.

45:27.751 --> 45:28.817
I really like you.

45:32.606 --> 45:33.806
I really like you.

45:35.976 --> 45:36.976
Yeah, but

45:39.229 --> 45:40.796
I'm older and I know that

45:42.032 --> 45:43.732
there aren't a lot
of good things around

45:45.835 --> 45:47.235
and I know that
you are really good.

48:04.558 --> 48:05.558
Okay, Teddy.

48:07.126 --> 48:08.126
So.

48:09.830 --> 48:11.046
Are you high?

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
No.

48:12.366 --> 48:13.799
I don't smoke anymore.

48:13.833 --> 48:14.833
You can test me.

48:18.021 --> 48:20.856
You drew a penis
on the runaway bunny.

48:23.293 --> 48:24.493
That was Fred.

48:25.812 --> 48:27.279
I didn't draw that.

48:27.314 --> 48:29.915
You had friends
coming to visit you

48:29.949 --> 48:32.469
while you were doing
community service
at the children's library?

48:32.936 --> 48:34.003
No one came.
It was me.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.407
I... But I will
pay for it

48:38.441 --> 48:41.360
and I know it was stupid...
Oh, yeah. You are going
to pay for the book.

48:41.394 --> 48:43.314
But you're not gonna do
your hours there anymore.

48:44.865 --> 48:46.582
They really like me there and...

48:46.616 --> 48:48.384
No, they don't like you.

48:48.418 --> 48:50.085
They don't like you one bit.

48:50.120 --> 48:53.272
You're lazy and you carved
"ape" in the bench outside.

48:53.306 --> 48:54.607
It was "April."

48:54.641 --> 48:55.991
Why would you carve "April"?

48:56.276 --> 48:58.310
I don't know.

48:58.345 --> 49:00.363
What kind of jerk defaces
a children's library?

49:01.931 --> 49:04.100
I mean, come on!

49:04.134 --> 49:05.484
<i>People are counting on you.</i>

49:05.518 --> 49:07.920
<i>Your parents are
counting on you.</i>

49:07.954 --> 49:12.191
<i>Your little sister</i>
<i>is counting on you.</i>
<i>What kind of example are you?</i>

49:12.225 --> 49:15.227
<i>What goes through</i>
<i>your mind when you do it?</i>
<i>Or do you not think at all?</i>

49:15.261 --> 49:17.096
<i>I'm gonna put myself
on the line, okay?</i>

49:17.130 --> 49:19.431
<i>I could lose my job.</i>

49:19.465 --> 49:21.533
<i>If you don't start thinking
about what you're doing</i>

49:21.568 --> 49:24.303
<i>you're gonna land yourself
right in juvenile hall.</i>

49:24.337 --> 49:26.405
<i>And who's this kid Fred?</i>

49:26.439 --> 49:29.141
<i>Why was he visiting
you at the library?</i>

49:29.176 --> 49:31.176
<i>Why do you wanna hang around
with people like that?</i>

49:31.178 --> 49:32.777
<i>That guy sounds like a loser.</i>

49:37.067 --> 49:38.067
Hey, Fred!

49:41.554 --> 49:44.440
Hey, buddy, you looking
for Fred? He's not here.

49:44.474 --> 49:45.874
Can I come in for a second?

49:47.477 --> 49:49.044
Yeah, sure, you can come in.

49:49.078 --> 49:50.112
You okay?
Yeah.

49:51.148 --> 49:53.315
What's... What's going on?

49:56.570 --> 49:58.937
You want something
to eat, drink?
No. Thanks, I'm fine.

50:00.607 --> 50:02.174
Had a pretty big
dinner last night.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.328
Oh, yeah?
Oh, I mean tonight.

50:07.647 --> 50:08.814
Last night.

50:09.482 --> 50:10.565
What did you have?

50:10.600 --> 50:11.600
Pasta.

50:13.970 --> 50:14.970
Yeah.

50:16.039 --> 50:17.473
I'm a little, uh...

50:17.507 --> 50:19.074
You smell that?

50:19.108 --> 50:21.009
Oh, yeah.
I'm a little high.

50:21.044 --> 50:22.127
I noticed that.

50:23.996 --> 50:26.248
Yeah?
It's cool, man.

50:26.282 --> 50:28.233
You wanna partake?

50:28.268 --> 50:30.136
Sure. Yeah. Really?

50:30.170 --> 50:34.039
Just do me a favor,
though. Don't...

50:34.073 --> 50:35.907
Let's keep it between us.
Oh, for sure. Okay.

50:39.646 --> 50:41.914
It's pretty strong, so go easy.

50:52.642 --> 50:54.142
I like your hair like that.

50:55.411 --> 50:56.411
My hair?

50:58.014 --> 50:59.014
Thanks, man.

51:02.068 --> 51:03.068
Ah.

51:03.302 --> 51:04.302
Ooh!

51:07.974 --> 51:09.475
Let me sit next to you.

51:09.509 --> 51:10.942
One second.

51:10.977 --> 51:12.377
Feel like I'm so far
away over here.

51:17.350 --> 51:19.651
Oh, God.

51:19.685 --> 51:21.420
I love this couch.

51:21.454 --> 51:23.422
Yeah, it's cool.
Isn't it comfortable?

51:23.456 --> 51:24.456
Mmm-hmm.

51:26.359 --> 51:28.160
It's my grandfather's
couch, this couch.

51:28.661 --> 51:29.661
Yeah?

51:31.397 --> 51:32.397
Bounce on it.

51:37.504 --> 51:41.173
Seriously. Just...
Just bounce on it.

51:41.207 --> 51:42.241
You want me to...

51:48.047 --> 51:50.048
I don't even know how
to answer that like...

51:50.450 --> 51:51.450
Just bounce on it.

51:52.452 --> 51:54.153
Just do it.
Just do it.

51:55.054 --> 51:56.321
Do it once.
All right.

52:01.594 --> 52:02.594
My God.

52:03.596 --> 52:05.997
I didn't know
you had an earring.

52:06.032 --> 52:07.699
I love it.
I love that on you.
Yeah?

52:07.733 --> 52:08.967
I did it myself.
Really?

52:10.303 --> 52:12.504
You're stoned,
aren't you?
I love this hair.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.607
I love it...
All right, all right.

52:15.642 --> 52:16.941
What?
What?

52:19.512 --> 52:20.712
Just...

52:20.746 --> 52:22.080
Just touching my hair.

52:24.450 --> 52:25.617
What?

52:25.652 --> 52:28.220
Nothing. You were
just touching my hair.
It's funny.

52:29.656 --> 52:31.089
What's funny about it?

52:32.392 --> 52:34.159
Nothing. Relax, man.
It's cool.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.063
What?

52:42.302 --> 52:43.542
Have you ever smoked with Fred?

52:53.680 --> 52:57.148
All right, dude.
I should probably
get going, man.

52:57.183 --> 52:59.351
Yeah, I just...
Thanks for everything, dude,
I'll see you around.

52:59.385 --> 53:01.286
Are you too high or...
No, I'm good, dude.

53:02.121 --> 53:03.355
Thanks.
All right. Uh...

53:05.225 --> 53:07.058
All right.
You okay to drive?

53:07.093 --> 53:08.527
Yeah, I am.

53:11.531 --> 53:12.564
All right, buddy.

53:14.334 --> 53:16.501
I think your dad
tried to come onto me.

53:16.536 --> 53:18.637
My dad's not gay, Teddy.

53:18.671 --> 53:19.671
Okay.

53:22.208 --> 53:24.509
It's kind of one of
those moments we're gonna
remember forever.

53:24.544 --> 53:25.544
Me and you.

53:26.279 --> 53:27.346
You ready?
Mmm-hmm.

53:28.314 --> 53:30.649
Dude, could I try first?

53:30.683 --> 53:33.218
You fucking kidding me?
We'll switch off
half way or something.

53:34.186 --> 53:35.387
Fine. Go on.
All right.

53:39.525 --> 53:41.627
Dude, you're holding it
way too fucking low.
No. No, no. Chill.

53:41.661 --> 53:43.662
I got it.
No. Give me the fucking thing.
You're gonna...

53:43.696 --> 53:45.797
Stop. It'll cut your leg off.
Be careful, dude.

53:45.831 --> 53:47.699
Let me try.
Dude, it was my
idea in the first...

53:47.734 --> 53:50.201
I'll give it you... Okay.
Just fucking give
it to me. Stop.

53:51.271 --> 53:53.405
Okay.
Okay, I'm excited.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.340
All right, let's do this, dude.

53:55.375 --> 53:58.143
Let's cut this bitch down.
Come on.

53:58.177 --> 54:00.145
This fucking tree
needs to die tonight.

54:02.649 --> 54:03.649
Oh, yeah.

54:10.824 --> 54:12.357
- Whoo!
- Yes.

54:17.464 --> 54:19.281
I can't wait to come
see your band play.

54:19.315 --> 54:20.716
I know. We're good.

54:20.750 --> 54:22.817
There's only three of us.

54:36.633 --> 54:37.633
Hello.

54:38.868 --> 54:40.235
Drew your picture.

54:41.204 --> 54:42.204
Oh!

54:47.543 --> 54:48.543
Oh!

54:50.880 --> 54:52.114
That's...

54:52.849 --> 54:54.282
That's nice.

54:55.819 --> 54:57.219
Very nice.

55:14.270 --> 55:15.337
I'll get it.

55:21.794 --> 55:22.861
Hi.

55:23.746 --> 55:24.913
Hi.

55:24.947 --> 55:26.348
When I do this...

55:28.217 --> 55:29.485
Does it make me look Chinese?

55:34.674 --> 55:36.208
We're going to play
in the garden?

55:38.478 --> 55:39.478
Nice.

55:42.549 --> 55:44.649
<i>Teddy was always
gone doing work</i>

55:44.684 --> 55:46.801
<i>or probation or whatever
you call that baloney.</i>

55:46.836 --> 55:49.738
<i>We talked on the phone</i>
<i>a few times.</i>
<i>Emily didn't have any friends.</i>

55:49.772 --> 55:51.523
<i>I didn't talk long.</i>
<i>The only person</i>
<i>she knew was me.</i>

55:51.558 --> 55:53.358
<i>Just enough to make
her feel comfortable.</i>

55:53.393 --> 55:55.660
<i>One afternoon we went
to Jason King's house.</i>

55:55.695 --> 55:57.596
<i>She didn't talk much.</i>

55:57.630 --> 55:59.231
<i>Jason's parents were gone.</i>

55:59.265 --> 56:00.165
<i>I did all the talking.
We were drinking</i>

56:00.199 --> 56:01.967
<i>sodas and vodka and smoking pot.</i>

56:02.001 --> 56:03.568
<i>I was a nice guy.</i>

56:03.602 --> 56:04.803
<i>I'm a nice guy to everyone.</i>

56:04.838 --> 56:06.304
<i>Emily came over.</i>

56:06.339 --> 56:08.673
<i>I got her into Jason's</i>
<i>parents' bed</i>
<i>and got her naked.</i>

56:09.976 --> 56:11.744
<i>The guys lined up
outside the bedroom.</i>

56:11.778 --> 56:13.511
<i>Big brown house.</i>

56:13.546 --> 56:15.714
<i>We went in
two or three at a time.</i>

56:18.118 --> 56:19.468
<i>Everyone fucked her.</i>

56:19.502 --> 56:21.552
<i>We ran around the house to...</i>

56:21.587 --> 56:22.921
<i>I kept going back
in with everyone...</i>

56:22.955 --> 56:24.239
<i>She gave me a blowjob.</i>

56:25.008 --> 56:26.108
<i>I asked if she liked it.</i>

56:26.142 --> 56:27.976
<i>I had my clothes on when
I ushered people in.</i>

56:28.011 --> 56:29.311
<i>She said she did.</i>

56:29.345 --> 56:30.779
<i>I was a wild monkey.</i>

56:32.816 --> 56:33.816
<i>Then I left.</i>

56:50.366 --> 56:51.399
Tell me you love me.

57:15.692 --> 57:16.925
Hey.

57:16.959 --> 57:17.959
Hey.
What's up?

57:19.395 --> 57:20.862
Nothing.

57:20.896 --> 57:21.930
How're you doing?

57:21.964 --> 57:22.964
I'm fine. How are you?

57:23.883 --> 57:24.883
Good.

57:32.859 --> 57:33.859
Uh...

57:37.964 --> 57:39.481
Do you... Do you want it?

57:40.566 --> 57:41.733
I love the pink ones.

57:42.801 --> 57:43.801
So good.

57:48.607 --> 57:50.608
All right.
Thank you.

57:50.642 --> 57:52.002
Yeah, I'll see
you later. Bye.
Okay.

58:06.926 --> 58:08.246
That's how you play.
Go like this.

58:14.017 --> 58:15.017
All right.

58:17.103 --> 58:18.436
There you go.

58:34.987 --> 58:36.027
You almost got it.
Come on.

58:36.789 --> 58:38.356
How's that foot?
Come here.

58:49.018 --> 58:50.585
Not in this color, though.

59:00.079 --> 59:01.546
Hey.

59:02.514 --> 59:03.748
Beer?
No, thanks.

59:10.189 --> 59:11.656
Wanna hear a joke?

59:15.644 --> 59:16.924
There's this horse
and a chicken.

59:18.647 --> 59:20.782
And the horse falls into
this big puddle of mud

59:22.151 --> 59:25.520
and, um, so the chicken
gets his Mercedes

59:25.554 --> 59:27.756
ties it to the horse
and pulls him out.

59:27.790 --> 59:30.058
Then the chicken
falls into the mud.

59:30.093 --> 59:32.493
The horse doesn't
get his Mercedes.
He just stands there.

59:32.528 --> 59:34.562
And he says,

59:34.597 --> 59:36.932
"Just hold onto my thingy
and I'll pull you out."

59:39.402 --> 59:40.402
That's funny.

59:41.604 --> 59:43.772
Well, it's not over.

59:43.806 --> 59:45.573
So, the moral of the story

59:45.608 --> 59:47.776
is that if you're
hung like a horse

59:47.810 --> 59:49.744
you don't need a Mercedes
to pick up chicks.

59:51.064 --> 59:52.764
Yeah. I get it.

59:58.788 --> 01:00:00.555
Why don't you talk to me
at school anymore?

01:00:02.942 --> 01:00:04.743
You know why.

01:00:04.777 --> 01:00:07.946
Yeah, but you can
at least be nice to me,
not just ignore me.

01:00:10.616 --> 01:00:12.617
I mean, it's like you don't
even like me anymore.

01:00:14.036 --> 01:00:15.036
Are you kidding me?

01:00:16.706 --> 01:00:17.806
April, I love you.

01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:22.143
What?

01:00:26.565 --> 01:00:27.799
Doesn't even make sense.

01:00:28.967 --> 01:00:30.235
What? Why?

01:00:30.269 --> 01:00:31.586
I have to go.

01:00:32.855 --> 01:00:34.990
April. What...
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:35.024 --> 01:00:37.125
April, I love you.

01:00:38.944 --> 01:00:40.728
Okay.
I'm in love with you.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.432
I just...

01:00:43.466 --> 01:00:46.735
I... I was quiet before
because I didn't want
anything bad to happen

01:00:47.904 --> 01:00:49.521
but I don't care anymore.

01:00:49.555 --> 01:00:51.606
All right, I...
I just wanna
be with you.

01:00:52.842 --> 01:00:54.843
We can
figure it out. You...

01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:57.317
You can just say
you're babysitting all
the time and come over.

01:00:57.796 --> 01:00:59.497
No, I'm...

01:00:59.532 --> 01:01:01.783
I should be hanging out
with boys my own age.

01:01:01.785 --> 01:01:03.585
Why?

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:05.987
Why do you wanna hang
out with a bunch
of little boys. You're...

01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:07.489
You're better than that.

01:01:08.557 --> 01:01:09.924
Just be with me.

01:01:10.743 --> 01:01:11.743
April.

01:01:12.545 --> 01:01:13.545
Look, uh...

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.132
Please, all right.
Just...

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:19.867
Let's just...
Just start all over.

01:01:19.901 --> 01:01:22.504
Just watch a movie,
find something silly and...

01:01:24.773 --> 01:01:25.806
Like always, okay?

01:01:30.028 --> 01:01:31.028
Just stay. April!

01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:38.002
So the founding
of Rome begins
with a fratricide

01:01:38.036 --> 01:01:41.038
as Romulus kills
his twin brother, Remus.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:45.277
Seems appropriate seeing
as their father is Mars,
the Roman god of war.

01:01:47.813 --> 01:01:51.082
Folks, there will be
a test on this sometime
in the next week.

01:01:51.117 --> 01:01:52.901
Thank you very much.
Great work today.

01:01:53.002 --> 01:01:54.653
April, can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:01:58.908 --> 01:01:59.908
Um...

01:02:02.178 --> 01:02:03.644
I read your paper.

01:02:05.914 --> 01:02:07.154
Did someone help you with this?

01:02:08.818 --> 01:02:10.585
It doesn't seem
like your writing.

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:11.720
Um...

01:02:11.754 --> 01:02:13.087
It's my step-daddy.

01:02:13.121 --> 01:02:16.591
I just asked him
to help me correct it
and then he just kind of

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.793
started rewriting it and...

01:02:18.827 --> 01:02:21.147
I can't give you
a passing grade on this.
Do you understand?

01:02:22.147 --> 01:02:24.199
What's your next class?
I'll write you a slip.

01:02:24.233 --> 01:02:25.233
<i>It, uh...</i>

01:02:25.267 --> 01:02:27.953
<i>It's college counseling.</i>

01:02:27.955 --> 01:02:29.921
Do you know what college
you would like to go to?

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.123
They're so competitive
these days

01:02:32.158 --> 01:02:34.709
that you need all
the time you can get.

01:02:34.744 --> 01:02:36.060
I want you to give
some thought to that

01:02:36.095 --> 01:02:38.313
because there are
only a few weeks left.

01:02:38.347 --> 01:02:41.082
You excel in art class.

01:02:41.117 --> 01:02:42.867
Would you like to
go to an art school?

01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:44.202
Maybe.
Maybe.

01:02:44.236 --> 01:02:45.836
Maybe.

01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:47.872
You know what you wanna do?

01:02:47.906 --> 01:02:48.986
You know what you wanna be?

01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:52.443
I don't know.

01:02:52.445 --> 01:02:54.095
I want you to stay
on that soccer team

01:02:54.129 --> 01:02:56.947
because that could
be so helpful.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:59.901
Can I go to the bathroom
real quick?

01:02:59.903 --> 01:03:00.903
Uh, but...

01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:08.843
I'm literally punching
myself that I didn't buy
that dress yesterday.

01:03:08.877 --> 01:03:10.245
Oh, I know.

01:03:10.279 --> 01:03:12.864
No, honestly, it looks
so fucking good on me.

01:03:12.898 --> 01:03:13.831
You need to go back and get it.

01:03:13.865 --> 01:03:16.735
What if we just ditch
and go to the mall
and get it.

01:03:16.769 --> 01:03:19.070
Let's do it.
Your tits are seriously
so huge today.

01:03:19.104 --> 01:03:20.204
I know, right?

01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:22.056
They look amazing.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.476
'Cause I'm on my period,
which kind of sucks but...

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.812
Probably,
but it's totally worth it.
You're making the best of it.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.164
They look great.

01:03:29.198 --> 01:03:31.382
Okay, I have to pee like
a mother fucking race horse.

01:03:31.417 --> 01:03:33.151
I do, too.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:34.986
Why do they even say
"I have to pee
like a race horse"?

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.254
I don't know.

01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:38.323
I don't get that, like...

01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:42.360
Do race horses just, like,
have to pee all the time.
I don't get it.

01:03:42.395 --> 01:03:45.297
Because they're always racing
and they never get to pee.

01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:47.399
Poor horsies.
Oh, I don't
have toilet paper.

01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:49.301
Can you spot me?

01:03:49.335 --> 01:03:50.669
Of course, sweetie.

01:03:57.176 --> 01:03:58.176
Oh.

01:03:59.478 --> 01:04:01.913
All right.
How's my hair?

01:04:06.285 --> 01:04:07.518
Don't look
at the easel.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.704
Look at the model instead.

01:04:09.738 --> 01:04:12.290
More green. Okay, no.

01:04:12.325 --> 01:04:14.859
You're looking at the easel.
You're looking at the easel.

01:04:14.894 --> 01:04:16.928
Look at the model
and don't look at the easel.

01:04:16.962 --> 01:04:18.996
Jesus. That model's
kind of hot.

01:04:20.966 --> 01:04:22.166
She looks like an old tree.

01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.118
I'd fuck a tree.

01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:27.505
I'd fuck the shit
out of that tree.

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:28.539
Nice.

01:04:33.512 --> 01:04:35.797
You know, I had
a near death experience
myself once.

01:04:37.032 --> 01:04:39.734
I was going down the tunnel

01:04:39.768 --> 01:04:42.070
in a convertible car,
old convertible car.

01:04:42.104 --> 01:04:44.539
It's not my car.
It's freezing cold.

01:04:44.573 --> 01:04:48.092
Ice, like brown
melting ugly ice.

01:04:48.126 --> 01:04:50.828
I say to myself,
"Bob, you're going down
the tunnel of death."

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.431
Then I say to myself,

01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:56.267
"My name is not Bob.
I'm not Bob."

01:04:56.302 --> 01:04:58.502
Then I said,
"It's not my car."

01:04:58.537 --> 01:05:01.339
And this is not my tunnel.

01:05:01.373 --> 01:05:02.640
So, what happened?

01:05:02.675 --> 01:05:06.094
I made a uie
and suddenly I'm going
fast the other way

01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:07.896
and there's a rainbow.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:08.997
It's a rainbow.

01:05:10.499 --> 01:05:12.400
You're going down
the wrong way, Bob.

01:05:12.434 --> 01:05:14.035
Turn your art around.

01:05:14.837 --> 01:05:16.871
Dude, I'm not Bob.

01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:19.107
Yes, yes.

01:05:19.141 --> 01:05:20.491
All right.

01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:21.992
That's right.

01:05:22.027 --> 01:05:23.445
I'm not fucking Bob.

01:05:23.479 --> 01:05:25.947
Dude, what the fuck is going on?

01:05:29.919 --> 01:05:31.452
This is kind of fun, isn't it?

01:05:31.486 --> 01:05:32.887
Yeah.

01:05:35.090 --> 01:05:38.092
I'm doing an ocean.
What are you doing?

01:05:38.126 --> 01:05:39.994
I'm also doing an ocean.

01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:41.796
Oh, I love yours.
That's so good.

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:43.598
Thank you.

01:05:43.632 --> 01:05:45.416
Hey, Teddy.
Hey.

01:05:45.451 --> 01:05:48.453
Tanya's daughter came by
and saw the pictures
you drew of her.

01:05:48.487 --> 01:05:50.371
She liked them.
Really?

01:05:50.406 --> 01:05:52.057
You should
go see her.
Room 22.

01:05:54.026 --> 01:05:55.293
Hey, Janet.
Bye.

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:57.062
Hi.
How are you?

01:05:57.096 --> 01:05:58.396
Oh, pretty good.
That's very pretty.

01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:59.798
Yeah?
That's a fish.

01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:00.899
Hello.

01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:05.003
Yes.
Oh, hi.
Hi.

01:06:05.037 --> 01:06:07.038
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
Sit down.

01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.408
I see you got the pictures up.

01:06:10.443 --> 01:06:12.877
- You draw so well.
- No. I'm crap.

01:06:12.911 --> 01:06:15.162
No. No.
Come here.

01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.869
You're a good boy.

01:06:23.038 --> 01:06:25.039
And you captured me good.

01:06:25.073 --> 01:06:26.541
Thank you.

01:06:26.575 --> 01:06:28.042
Now listen,

01:06:29.077 --> 01:06:32.580
always have faith and trust

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.882
in your
God-given talent.

01:06:36.518 --> 01:06:38.385
All right,
what time is it?
Game time!

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.288
That's right.
All right,
listen up.

01:06:40.322 --> 01:06:43.358
I want you to play
a smart game,
pass the ball.

01:06:43.392 --> 01:06:45.259
Keep it tight.
High pressure,
all right?

01:06:45.294 --> 01:06:47.545
Everything we've
been practicing.
Okay, you got this.

01:06:47.547 --> 01:06:49.179
You got these bitches.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.048
They're pathetic all right.

01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.583
- You got this, okay.
- Yeah!

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.435
All right, bring it in.
Bring it in.
Whoo!

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:56.220
What are we
going to do?
Win.

01:06:56.254 --> 01:06:57.588
What are we
going to do?
Win!

01:06:57.623 --> 01:07:00.074
One, two, three,
Panthers!
Panthers!

01:07:00.108 --> 01:07:01.659
Come on!

01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:03.044
Come on.

01:07:10.268 --> 01:07:11.535
Raquel, that's you!
Let's go!

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.306
Looking good, April!

01:07:15.341 --> 01:07:17.975
Come on!
Okay, pull back!

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.161
Stretch!

01:07:29.121 --> 01:07:30.121
Oh, my God!

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.007
Come on, get up.

01:07:35.127 --> 01:07:36.544
That's right,
push in! Push in!

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:40.098
Fuck with me!

01:07:40.132 --> 01:07:42.099
Fuck with me, bitch!
Come on.

01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:43.213
Shauna, what are you doing?

01:07:46.038 --> 01:07:47.305
Thank you.
It's un-fucking-real!

01:07:53.562 --> 01:07:54.562
Oh.

01:07:55.898 --> 01:07:57.164
April, come on!

01:08:01.053 --> 01:08:02.236
April, go!

01:08:10.579 --> 01:08:11.912
All right.

01:08:12.448 --> 01:08:14.115
All right, good game!

01:08:14.983 --> 01:08:16.149
Good game.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:19.053
Shake.

01:08:20.622 --> 01:08:22.462
You got some
good players. All right.
Thank you.

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:31.316
Raquel is such
a cry baby.
I know.

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:33.151
She just does that
for attention, though.

01:08:34.102 --> 01:08:35.341
You seriously think you're bad?

01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:39.674
I mean, do you even
think she's pretty?

01:08:39.707 --> 01:08:42.176
Raquel?
Yeah, she's
fucking gorgeous.

01:08:42.211 --> 01:08:44.645
She's pretty.
You think?

01:08:44.679 --> 01:08:46.229
She's not ugly.

01:08:46.264 --> 01:08:47.564
Don't blame yourself.

01:08:47.599 --> 01:08:49.133
Okay.
All right.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.402
I'll see you next week.

01:08:51.435 --> 01:08:52.636
I don't think she's so pretty.

01:08:54.038 --> 01:08:55.606
April, she's pretty.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.242
So, you three upset, too?

01:08:58.644 --> 01:09:00.411
Obviously.

01:09:00.446 --> 01:09:02.546
Yeah, we're not crying
but we're upset.

01:09:03.548 --> 01:09:06.216
It's just a game.
We played very well.

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:07.600
We kind of sucked.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.871
Um, no, you sucked.

01:09:10.904 --> 01:09:12.256
Thank you, Mr. B.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.261
Anyone need a ride?

01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:18.746
No, my mom's
going to come get us.

01:09:18.781 --> 01:09:20.448
I'm with her.

01:09:20.483 --> 01:09:21.483
April?

01:09:23.234 --> 01:09:25.703
- Sure.
- Okay, let's go.

01:09:25.738 --> 01:09:27.638
I'll see you
guys later.
Bye, April.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.307
Night.
Night.

01:09:30.675 --> 01:09:32.076
Bye.

01:09:40.586 --> 01:09:41.586
Where's Michael?

01:09:42.654 --> 01:09:44.255
Oh, he's at his moms.

01:09:45.156 --> 01:09:46.189
Oh.

01:09:50.261 --> 01:09:51.462
Want some water or something?

01:09:52.264 --> 01:09:55.132
Um, no, that's okay.

01:09:58.169 --> 01:09:59.470
It's nice to have you back here.

01:10:01.373 --> 01:10:03.040
Don't worry about the game.

01:10:49.521 --> 01:10:51.288
I know it's not Thursday.

01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:54.659
I always get the days wrong.

01:12:24.349 --> 01:12:27.318
You so crazy.
You're so crazy.

01:12:28.787 --> 01:12:32.256
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, Mom.

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:33.791
Hold on, Jamal,
I'm gonna call you.

01:12:33.825 --> 01:12:35.342
Do you want some breakfast?

01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:38.512
Um, that's okay.

01:12:38.547 --> 01:12:40.787
I'm gonna call you
back, okay? Let me
call you right back.

01:12:40.799 --> 01:12:42.467
I can make you eggs and bacon.

01:12:44.503 --> 01:12:46.904
Okay, sure.
That sounds good.

01:12:46.939 --> 01:12:49.407
How 'bout some orange
juice? You want
some orange juice?

01:12:49.409 --> 01:12:51.458
I just love you,
you're such a good girl.

01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:58.432
I love you, too.
Aw. You mean
so much to me.

01:13:05.157 --> 01:13:08.375
<i>Test your might!</i>

01:13:18.653 --> 01:13:20.254
<i>Fight.</i>

01:13:23.491 --> 01:13:25.392
You're not allowed to do that.

01:13:27.495 --> 01:13:28.729
Are you going to tell on me?

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:42.009
Can I play?

01:13:42.878 --> 01:13:44.512
Sure. I don't care.

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.866
All right, what do I do?

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.567
You have to pick
a character first.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.871
I wanna be the girl character.

01:13:53.905 --> 01:13:56.824
The girl character?
She sucks.

01:13:56.858 --> 01:13:58.792
Trust me.
I've played her.

01:13:58.826 --> 01:14:00.861
All right, well, I still
wanna be her, so...

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:02.713
Suit yourself.

01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:05.282
<i>Fight!</i>

01:14:07.536 --> 01:14:09.570
Hey, how do I fight?
You press the buttons.

01:14:09.604 --> 01:14:10.888
Oh, come on, which ones?

01:14:13.075 --> 01:14:14.809
Which color?

01:14:14.843 --> 01:14:16.009
Hey.

01:14:17.779 --> 01:14:18.779
Yes!

01:14:19.464 --> 01:14:21.398
Two cookies please!

01:14:21.799 --> 01:14:22.950
What?

01:14:22.984 --> 01:14:25.135
I get two cookies because I won.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.937
Says who?

01:14:26.971 --> 01:14:27.971
Raquel.

01:14:31.826 --> 01:14:33.377
Raquel?

01:14:33.411 --> 01:14:35.346
Raquel's my other babysitter.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.348
She lets me have
two cookies when I win.

01:14:38.133 --> 01:14:39.466
Hmm.

01:14:43.005 --> 01:14:44.538
Well, okay.

01:14:52.581 --> 01:14:54.548
I want one Oreo
and one chocolate chip.

01:14:55.517 --> 01:14:57.384
Here you go.
Have 'em all.

01:15:25.863 --> 01:15:27.564
Hello.

01:15:27.598 --> 01:15:30.734
<i>April.</i>
Who's this?

01:15:30.768 --> 01:15:33.837
<i>Look, what happened</i>
<i>between me and Raquel...</i>
<i>It's nothing, okay?</i>

01:15:33.871 --> 01:15:35.906
<i>Can I just explain
what happened?</i>

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:39.509
What?

01:15:39.544 --> 01:15:43.880
<i>You broke up with me.</i>
<i>And we weren't talking to</i>
<i>each other. Can I see you?</i>

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:47.418
No. No, I'm not coming
over there anymore.

01:15:47.452 --> 01:15:49.704
<i>April, I love you.
Please.</i>

01:15:55.994 --> 01:15:58.212
Dude, isn't this a...

01:15:58.247 --> 01:16:01.399
Oh, gee, you're
acting like we're in
a recession. Give me.

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:02.873
I wanna show you
how to do this shit.

01:16:03.852 --> 01:16:05.619
I ought to...

01:16:05.654 --> 01:16:07.855
Chef Ivan at your service.

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:12.376
Emily.

01:16:14.479 --> 01:16:17.147
Hey, Emily.
Emily, hi, hi.

01:16:17.182 --> 01:16:18.949
Hi.
Hi.

01:16:18.984 --> 01:16:21.785
You look, um...
You look really beautiful.

01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:25.823
You look, uh...
Yeah, your whole,

01:16:25.857 --> 01:16:28.558
um, dress.

01:16:28.593 --> 01:16:31.195
You look really...
You look really great.

01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:32.830
Thanks.

01:16:32.864 --> 01:16:34.648
All right, sorry.

01:16:34.682 --> 01:16:36.550
Hey, I have this idea, um...

01:16:37.953 --> 01:16:40.554
Uh, I saw this pool.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:43.957
And I was wondering
maybe you want to like

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.994
go swimming.

01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:48.862
Swimming?
Yeah.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.965
<i>♪ We could go swimming</i>

01:16:50.999 --> 01:16:53.533
<i>♪ We could go swimming ♪</i>
Okay, fine.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:54.935
Fine.
Really?

01:16:55.904 --> 01:16:58.172
Mmm-hmm.
Okay. Okay, all right.

01:16:58.206 --> 01:16:59.807
Okay.

01:17:09.183 --> 01:17:12.586
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
where's the light?
The light?

01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:13.887
Need a lighter?
Yeah.

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:17.758
- Here you go.
- Found it.

01:17:17.793 --> 01:17:19.627
Jump. Jump to me.
Jump to me.
Wait.

01:17:19.661 --> 01:17:20.861
Jump... Whoa!

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:22.730
Let's go.

01:17:31.573 --> 01:17:33.040
Are you ready to
see me get naked?

01:17:41.983 --> 01:17:43.784
What are you doing?

01:17:43.819 --> 01:17:45.252
I'm jumping in the pool.
Aren't you getting in?

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.488
No, it's cold.
Come on.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.729
This is called night swimming.

01:17:55.764 --> 01:17:57.665
Ready, one, two...

01:17:59.117 --> 01:18:00.868
They were just saying
that in college,

01:18:00.902 --> 01:18:02.703
like girls have sex
all the time.

01:18:02.737 --> 01:18:04.104
So maybe like when
you get to college,

01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:06.273
you won't be a sweet
little virgin anymore.

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:07.808
Thank you.

01:18:07.843 --> 01:18:09.877
She's a virgin?
She's a virgin,
you guys.

01:18:09.911 --> 01:18:12.746
Isn't that so adorable,
though? Look at...
She's so pretty.

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.281
We can do something
about that.
No, April.

01:18:14.316 --> 01:18:17.718
You scared her off.
They can help.
Oh, honey.

01:18:17.752 --> 01:18:19.653
I mean, are you
all virgins, too?

01:18:27.112 --> 01:18:28.645
Hey.
Hey.

01:18:35.186 --> 01:18:36.686
How's it goin'?

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:39.156
Good.

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:40.557
How are you?

01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:46.096
You should, uh, flip one over

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.766
for good luck.

01:18:53.038 --> 01:18:55.272
You know like when
you get a new pack,

01:18:55.307 --> 01:18:57.607
you always flip
one over and
save it for last

01:18:57.642 --> 01:18:59.322
and then when
you get to it
you make a wish.

01:19:00.078 --> 01:19:02.646
Oh, cool, I've never
heard of that.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.081
Like that?
Yeah.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:13.723
Do you need a light?

01:19:20.182 --> 01:19:21.682
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:19:28.923 --> 01:19:30.790
That movie is pretty
stupid.

01:19:31.459 --> 01:19:32.626
Why?

01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:36.913
I think all movies and TV shows

01:19:36.948 --> 01:19:39.015
and video games these
days are just pointless.

01:19:39.668 --> 01:19:40.868
Okay.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.908
You're crazy.

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.228
No, I'm not.

01:19:51.262 --> 01:19:52.646
Yeah, you are.

01:19:54.799 --> 01:19:56.883
Why would you say that?

01:19:56.918 --> 01:19:59.135
Because you just don't
care about anything.

01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:04.875
I wish I didn't care
about anything.

01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:09.880
But I do care. I care
about everything too much.

01:20:10.865 --> 01:20:12.349
What do you mean?

01:20:12.383 --> 01:20:14.801
It's whatever, Teddy.

01:20:14.836 --> 01:20:16.716
I think you're the one
who doesn't care, not me.

01:20:18.038 --> 01:20:19.873
What do you mean?
I care about you.

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:26.997
What? You...

01:20:28.099 --> 01:20:29.933
You never even hang out with me.

01:20:31.903 --> 01:20:33.220
Yeah, I love you.

01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:55.892
I love you.

01:21:04.886 --> 01:21:07.821
<i>Do you remember that
night at the graveyard?</i>

01:21:09.224 --> 01:21:11.058
<i>When we went to that tree?</i>

01:21:11.092 --> 01:21:13.059
The one that
I carved a heart in?

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:14.928
Yeah.
That was fun.

01:21:16.597 --> 01:21:17.898
That was fun.

01:21:19.434 --> 01:21:21.202
I wish we could go
back to that night.

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:24.772
You know that
me and Fred
cut it down, right?

01:21:25.323 --> 01:21:26.323
What?

01:21:31.529 --> 01:21:33.730
That's so sad.
Yeah.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.420
That tree was probably
there since the Civil War.

01:21:38.503 --> 01:21:39.903
And now it's gone.

01:21:43.174 --> 01:21:44.241
It's kind of sad.

01:21:46.077 --> 01:21:47.727
Come on, get in the pool.

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.448
No.
Come on,
it feels great.

01:21:51.482 --> 01:21:53.433
I'm shivering but not
because it's cold.

01:21:53.467 --> 01:21:55.736
I'm shivering because
you're so beautiful.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.905
Not gonna work this time.

01:21:59.056 --> 01:22:01.391
Emily, just get
in the fuckin' pool.
No!

01:22:01.426 --> 01:22:02.576
Get in the fuckin' pool, Emily.

01:22:02.627 --> 01:22:05.279
I'm not getting
in the fucking pool.

01:22:05.313 --> 01:22:06.863
Get in the pool!
I've been excited
about this!

01:22:06.898 --> 01:22:08.432
Just get in, okay?

01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:10.901
Stop asking me. No!

01:22:10.935 --> 01:22:12.336
Get in the pool, whore.

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:15.372
You can be a real cunt,
you know that?

01:22:15.407 --> 01:22:19.292
Just get in
the fucking
pool, okay?

01:22:19.326 --> 01:22:20.727
You know what, Fred?

01:22:20.762 --> 01:22:22.495
What?

01:22:22.514 --> 01:22:24.448
I thought I loved you
but you're a real...
What?

01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:27.051
Fucking douchebag!
I'm a what? I'm
a douche...

01:22:31.839 --> 01:22:33.574
Fuck!

01:22:33.608 --> 01:22:35.876
Got you!
Got you!

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:40.114
What the fuck!

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:47.121
What? What? What?

01:22:47.155 --> 01:22:50.023
You made me do all those
things! I hate you!
Come on. Come on.

01:22:50.058 --> 01:22:52.492
Come on.
You set me up!

01:22:52.526 --> 01:22:55.295
Come on, kiss me, kiss me,
kiss, me, kiss me, kiss me.
Fuck you!

01:22:55.329 --> 01:22:58.314
Sick and disgusting!

01:23:01.636 --> 01:23:03.336
Are you gonna hit
me with a bottle?
Don't!

01:23:03.371 --> 01:23:04.471
You're gonna hit
me with a bottle?
Don't!

01:23:04.505 --> 01:23:05.438
Come on, hit me.
I dare you.

01:23:05.473 --> 01:23:07.875
You wouldn't do
it, pussy. Pussy.
Don't!

01:23:07.909 --> 01:23:10.010
Pussy, pussy, pussy.
Stop!

01:23:10.044 --> 01:23:12.246
Stop!
You're not gonna hit
me with a fuckin' bottle.

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:19.419
Ah.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:31.498
You bitch.
What the fuck!

01:23:31.532 --> 01:23:32.933
I was just messing around.

01:23:35.569 --> 01:23:36.970
Fuck!

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:48.298
Teddy?

01:23:51.102 --> 01:23:52.402
Let's go!

01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.382
Hey what's going on?
Can we have some stogs?

01:24:08.185 --> 01:24:09.235
Sure.
Let me get one, too.

01:24:12.039 --> 01:24:14.007
Aren't you guys
a little young for
drinking and smoking?

01:24:14.041 --> 01:24:15.575
No, we like 'em.

01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:18.295
What? No.
You guys look
younger than me.

01:24:18.329 --> 01:24:20.330
- How old are you?
- Where are you from?

01:24:20.364 --> 01:24:21.548
Around here.

01:24:23.084 --> 01:24:25.301
I like your hair.
It's really pretty.

01:24:25.336 --> 01:24:27.387
Thanks.

01:24:27.421 --> 01:24:30.123
You want the last one?
They just took
all my cigarettes.

01:24:30.157 --> 01:24:32.425
Sucks.
I just bought this pack.

01:24:32.459 --> 01:24:34.995
Well, at least now
you can make a wish.

01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:37.030
Remember you can make...
You can make your wish.

01:24:38.983 --> 01:24:41.217
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

01:24:43.137 --> 01:24:44.257
What are you gonna wish for?

01:25:01.556 --> 01:25:02.639
- Are you okay, dude?
- Yeah.

01:25:02.673 --> 01:25:04.725
What happened?
Nothing just...

01:25:04.759 --> 01:25:08.395
You okay.
Yeah. Can we go buy
some weed please?

01:25:08.429 --> 01:25:11.048
Yeah. Listen,
do you wanna come?

01:25:11.349 --> 01:25:13.684
Oh, fuck. Can you
give me a fuckin'
break, Teddy?

01:25:13.718 --> 01:25:16.219
Skull's waiting for us
to buy some weed.
Um, no.

01:25:16.253 --> 01:25:18.293
I should probably
wait here so I can
get a ride home.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:19.622
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

01:25:19.657 --> 01:25:23.242
Um...
Maybe tomorrow.

01:25:23.277 --> 01:25:25.662
Yeah.
I don't know what
you're doing...

01:25:25.696 --> 01:25:29.115
I'll text you or something?
Yeah, sure.
I'll text you.

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:30.517
Or you can text me.

01:25:30.551 --> 01:25:32.235
Thank you, April.
Let's go.

01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:35.071
Call you or... I mean...
See you later.
Come on. Come on.

01:25:45.699 --> 01:25:47.539
Dude, what do you...
What happened to
your head?

01:25:47.568 --> 01:25:49.736
What, uh...
What do you mean?

01:25:49.771 --> 01:25:51.371
I mean,
what happened, dude?
Are you all right?

01:25:51.405 --> 01:25:53.606
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:55.341
Who did that?
Hey, what would
you do if,

01:25:55.376 --> 01:25:56.977
if you were an Egyptian?

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.248
I'd be a pharaoh.

01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:07.320
You can't be a
fuckin' pharaoh.
Why not?

01:26:07.355 --> 01:26:09.256
You can't be a
fuckin' pharaoh.
Why not?

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.427
I don't even want to
be Egyptian anyways.

01:26:16.447 --> 01:26:19.382
All that sand
and mummies and shit,
it's so boring.

01:26:22.119 --> 01:26:23.587
I'd be an Aztec or a Mayan.

01:26:25.673 --> 01:26:28.074
Then I'd fucking
cut your heart out.

01:26:29.594 --> 01:26:33.096
Hey, maybe we can
cut Skull's heart out.

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:34.764
Skull would fuck you up.
Just rip it out of him.

01:26:34.799 --> 01:26:37.467
He wouldn't be able
to fuck me up if I, uh,

01:26:37.502 --> 01:26:39.335
stabbed him in
the stomach first.

01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:41.237
Stop. What the fuck?

01:26:41.272 --> 01:26:43.507
What are you
doing? Stop.

01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:46.142
What are you doing, man?

01:26:46.176 --> 01:26:48.645
Fred, fuck, dude.
Put that thing...
Fuck. Stop.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.244
'Sup, Skull?

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:06.512
How are you doin'?
How are you doin'?
Feel good?

01:27:07.448 --> 01:27:08.514
Nice.

01:27:11.118 --> 01:27:12.652
So you, uh,
so you got it?
Yes.

01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:17.240
Just a dime,
right? Want a hit?

01:27:22.763 --> 01:27:24.114
Hey, Skull?

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:28.451
Who'd you rather be
the pope or Pablo Escobar?

01:27:28.453 --> 01:27:30.486
Escobar for sure, man.

01:27:30.521 --> 01:27:32.539
Gets to have all
the fun.

01:27:32.573 --> 01:27:34.374
The pope gets to
live in the Vatican.

01:27:34.409 --> 01:27:35.642
He gets to see
Michelangelo
all the time.

01:27:35.676 --> 01:27:38.678
Escobar.
What do you think?
Shut the fuck up, Teddy.

01:27:38.713 --> 01:27:40.063
You know what you want?

01:27:41.866 --> 01:27:43.667
You what a knife.
Huh?

01:27:45.519 --> 01:27:50.306
This fucker could
cut your heart out,
with this fucking knife.

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.125
Cut your fucking heart out.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Hey...
He fucking said it to me.

01:27:54.145 --> 01:27:56.846
You try it,
I'll fucking kill you!
I never said that.

01:27:56.881 --> 01:27:58.898
This fucker's always
saying weird shit

01:27:58.932 --> 01:28:01.200
and trying to get
me to kill people.
I don't...

01:28:01.235 --> 01:28:03.720
He want... He was
talking about cutting
your heart out. I didn't...

01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:05.355
Skull, Skull,
Skull, Skull.
Yes.

01:28:06.758 --> 01:28:08.391
Would you rather
be gay or a girl?

01:28:10.227 --> 01:28:12.195
Neither.

01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:15.899
No, I'm just saying
if you had to.
Like, if a genie said so.

01:28:15.933 --> 01:28:17.334
Both of them have to suck dick.

01:28:17.368 --> 01:28:18.652
Exactly.

01:28:18.686 --> 01:28:21.354
Would that be so bad?

01:28:21.389 --> 01:28:23.623
I mean, don't you ever
get jealous of those

01:28:23.658 --> 01:28:26.660
girls in pornos that get to be

01:28:26.694 --> 01:28:28.854
on their knees in
the middle of all
those fucking dicks.

01:28:29.764 --> 01:28:32.365
Are you fuckin'
serious right now?

01:28:32.399 --> 01:28:34.384
Are you be...
Are you being fucking
serious right now?

01:28:34.419 --> 01:28:35.485
He's a fuckin' faggot.

01:28:36.787 --> 01:28:40.256
He's always saying
weird shit like this, dude.
No, no, no, no.

01:28:40.290 --> 01:28:42.275
This faggot is fucking serious.

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:44.327
You don't like
the idea of an
Around-The-World blow bang?

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:46.947
No, I like to have
a girl suck my dick.

01:28:46.981 --> 01:28:48.598
What's the difference?

01:28:48.633 --> 01:28:50.901
"What the difference?"

01:28:50.935 --> 01:28:52.769
Well, I'll tell
you the difference,

01:28:52.803 --> 01:28:54.437
because I am going in

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.724
and she's being got inside of.

01:28:57.759 --> 01:29:01.895
Yeah, and why is one
better? Why does one
make you better, Skull?

01:29:01.929 --> 01:29:04.831
And why when you're
inside her,
do you feel better?

01:29:04.866 --> 01:29:07.567
I mean, aren't you
on her turf, inside her?

01:29:07.601 --> 01:29:10.771
You know, isn't she
in control of you?

01:29:10.805 --> 01:29:13.907
Like a little fuckin'
baby with his mamma
making him feel good.

01:29:13.941 --> 01:29:14.941
Huh?

01:29:15.576 --> 01:29:17.861
Skull, why? Why?

01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:20.162
Because...
Because what?

01:30:27.832 --> 01:30:29.599
Hey, dude.

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:31.668
Hey, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude.

01:30:31.702 --> 01:30:33.369
Let's drive down the wrong way.

01:30:34.806 --> 01:30:36.355
Fred, why do you
have to be like this?

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:37.824
Why do I have to be like what?

01:30:37.858 --> 01:30:40.794
Why do you have to be
all fucking crazy
and psycho on me?

01:30:42.797 --> 01:30:45.832
Why do you have to try so
fucking hard to seem crazy,
man? I don't get it.

01:30:47.819 --> 01:30:51.387
I just...
I can't hang out with you
when you're like this.

01:30:54.892 --> 01:30:56.592
Okay.

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.669
I can't hang out
with you when
you're like this.

01:31:31.813 --> 01:31:33.847
Pull over.
Pull over.

01:31:37.585 --> 01:31:40.319
Just let me out, dude.
Let me the fuck out.

01:31:44.492 --> 01:31:45.792
Pull over, man.
Let me out.

01:31:57.154 --> 01:31:58.788
What are you doing?

01:32:57.964 --> 01:32:59.665
I'm not Bob.

01:33:01.968 --> 01:33:03.602
I'm not Bob.

01:33:05.889 --> 01:33:08.875
<i>I'm not Bob, I'm not Bob,
I'm not Bob.</i>

01:33:13.063 --> 01:33:15.448
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:33:16.683 --> 01:33:18.151
I'm not Bob!
