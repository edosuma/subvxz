01:23.901 --> 01:25.568
All right, get out of there.

01:28.739 --> 01:30.114
Let's go.

02:08.907 --> 02:10.782
<i>All the way down
and take a seat.</i>

02:12.619 --> 02:15.329
<i>Let's go. Stop your dragging.
Let's go! Move!</i>

02:20.627 --> 02:21.962
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

03:15.267 --> 03:17.935
Let's go! Line up! Line up!
Move! Move! Right turn!

03:23.611 --> 03:25.111
Stay with me!
Keep your head down!

03:25.196 --> 03:26.696
Line up! Line up!

03:26.781 --> 03:28.031
Everybody ready?
Come on.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.199
Line up!
Get off me!

03:31.535 --> 03:32.494
Come on.
- One...

03:32.620 --> 03:34.788
Now march us to the changing rooms.
...2, 3.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.414
Go. Let's go.
Line up!

03:39.878 --> 03:41.045
I know you.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.716
You just got paroled out of
here. You didn't last very long.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.427
When was that?

03:48.512 --> 03:50.054
8 weeks ago.

03:51.223 --> 03:52.765
Did 9 years.

03:53.683 --> 03:55.267
John. John Dillinger.

03:55.352 --> 03:56.685
That's right.

03:57.479 --> 03:58.896
My friends call me John.

04:00.607 --> 04:04.068
But a son-of-a-bitch screw like you
better address me as Mr. Dillinger.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.241
Open it! Open it or
I'll blow you in half.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.369
Against the wall.

04:17.541 --> 04:21.086
Take your clothes off, now!

04:21.838 --> 04:22.879
You did it, kid.

04:22.964 --> 04:24.089
Sure did, Walter.

04:27.260 --> 04:28.426
Give me the goddamn jacket.

04:28.511 --> 04:29.636
Red!

04:42.652 --> 04:45.487
Come on. Hurry up!
- Get undressed. Take your clothes off.

04:45.572 --> 04:46.697
Come on.

04:48.575 --> 04:50.325
You eyeballing me,
you son of a bitch?

04:51.619 --> 04:52.786
Cut it out, Shouse!

04:52.871 --> 04:55.247
Shouse! Shouse!

05:04.925 --> 05:05.967
Lockdown!

05:11.348 --> 05:12.891
Bring them in from the yard!

05:22.818 --> 05:24.277
There they are!

05:52.182 --> 05:54.350
Walter! Come on.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.396
Walter Dietrich's dead
'cause of you.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.190
The bastard guard wouldn't
do what he was told, Johnny.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.985
Homer?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.611
Just let him
have it, Johnny.

06:44.696 --> 06:45.696
Pete?

06:45.780 --> 06:47.155
It's up to you.

07:12.518 --> 07:13.810
How far is the farm?

07:14.770 --> 07:15.895
3.2 miles.

07:41.798 --> 07:43.007
We're ready!

07:43.925 --> 07:45.134
Okay. Let's go!

07:47.262 --> 07:49.138
Burn these, okay, honey?

07:50.849 --> 07:52.016
Thanks for getting us out, Red.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.225
It was Johnny's plan.

07:53.310 --> 07:54.560
Yeah, but thanks.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.029
Take me with you, mister.

08:06.448 --> 08:07.948
I can't, darling. I'm sorry.

08:28.346 --> 08:29.765
Welcome back, Pete.

08:32.434 --> 08:34.520
Let's go to Chicago
and make some money.

09:11.308 --> 09:13.143
Floyd, halt!

09:53.228 --> 09:54.562
Melvin, look out!

09:59.318 --> 10:02.028
Pretty Boy Floyd,
you are under arrest.

10:02.279 --> 10:04.989
It's Charles. Charles Floyd.

10:06.868 --> 10:10.454
Who are you? Melvin Purvis,
Bureau of Investigation.

10:11.206 --> 10:13.373
Where is your friend,
Harry Campbell?

10:13.458 --> 10:16.210
I believe you've killed me.

10:18.713 --> 10:20.214
So you can go rot in hell.

11:00.506 --> 11:01.631
Sport.

11:10.351 --> 11:12.269
Red, call Oscar.
Okay.

11:15.189 --> 11:17.023
Hi, there, doll.
Let's switch out the shorts.

11:17.108 --> 11:18.233
We gonna use Berman?

11:18.317 --> 11:20.694
Yeah. Get a Plymouth
and an Essex.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.198
Where them other gals?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.284
You get a hold of Marty?
Sure did.

11:26.368 --> 11:27.410
How you doing, Mr. Johnny?

11:27.494 --> 11:28.661
Doing great, Sport.

11:37.838 --> 11:40.798
The main spring's too tight
on this one. Jammed twice.

11:41.550 --> 11:42.925
I cut off one coil.

11:47.514 --> 11:49.932
And it rides up
and to the right.

11:50.017 --> 11:51.726
I widen port.

12:01.069 --> 12:02.612
Hey, Red.
Hi, Harry.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.326
Harry, this is Pete.
Pete, this is Harry Berman.

12:07.410 --> 12:08.910
Hi, Pete. How you doing?

12:08.995 --> 12:11.496
So, what do we got? Got a
couple of nice straight eights.

12:11.581 --> 12:14.333
Bored them out. Rebuilt
the carburetors myself.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.917
These are some really fast cars.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.711
Perfect work cars for
a couple of gentlemen.

12:20.048 --> 12:21.798
Johnny, how are you?
Good.

12:25.096 --> 12:26.305
Marty,

12:27.891 --> 12:30.267
tell me that me
and my boys are okay.

12:30.352 --> 12:31.518
As long as you stay
in East Chicago,

12:31.603 --> 12:34.021
you're in safe haven,
any time you want.

12:36.066 --> 12:37.691
Extra cake's in here.

12:37.776 --> 12:38.901
Thanks.

12:39.736 --> 12:40.778
Hey, Anna.

12:41.447 --> 12:44.991
I opened up in Chicago on Halsted
now. Come by and see the girls.

13:03.344 --> 13:04.427
How are you?

13:05.805 --> 13:11.601
On the floor! Now! Now! Do it!
Do it! On the floor, now! Now!

13:12.269 --> 13:14.938
Let's play a game, Mr. President.
It's called Spin the Dial.

13:15.064 --> 13:17.816
You, hands up!
Come on. And, you, sit down!

13:19.819 --> 13:21.070
On the floor!

13:21.488 --> 13:22.655
Relax, pops.

13:25.492 --> 13:26.659
Open it up.

13:26.785 --> 13:30.246
Empty it! Move, move!
Shut up!

13:30.330 --> 13:31.789
It's one of these.

13:35.836 --> 13:38.003
You can be a dead hero
or a live coward.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.300
Get it open.
All of it!

13:42.511 --> 13:43.886
You, hands up.
Come on!

13:45.055 --> 13:46.722
Empty it! All of it!

13:46.807 --> 13:48.599
Hey, sit down!

13:48.684 --> 13:49.892
Push it to me!

13:52.521 --> 13:54.021
And don't move!

14:09.038 --> 14:10.497
We got company!

14:21.426 --> 14:22.718
Move out of there!

14:33.438 --> 14:36.565
You can put it away. Not here for
your money. Here for the bank's money.

14:36.816 --> 14:38.109
I said, move it out of there!

14:38.194 --> 14:39.319
What for?

14:43.991 --> 14:46.409
Come here, sister.
Let's take a ride.

15:01.427 --> 15:02.677
Get down!

15:39.466 --> 15:41.467
Beat it.
You, too, sister.

15:45.472 --> 15:46.722
Come here.

15:53.981 --> 15:56.817
There you go, doll.
Something to remember me by.

16:01.614 --> 16:04.992
You know, when I'm not doing
this, I'm a scout for the movies.

16:05.785 --> 16:06.785
Really?

16:12.834 --> 16:13.917
Join hands.

16:14.002 --> 16:15.045
We'll freeze here!

16:15.130 --> 16:18.173
No. You'll worm your way out
of there in about 10 minutes.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.074
Why do we
need this?

16:43.159 --> 16:46.244
Because criminals flee in fast
automobiles across state lines,

16:46.329 --> 16:47.787
thereby defeating
local jurisdiction

16:47.872 --> 16:50.165
because there is no federal
police force to stop them.

16:50.249 --> 16:52.459
By my tally, your
Bureau wants to spend

16:52.543 --> 16:54.753
more taxpayers' dollars
catching crooks

16:54.837 --> 16:57.297
than what the crooks you
catch stole in the first place.

16:57.381 --> 16:59.341
Well, that's ridiculous.
The Bureau has apprehended

16:59.425 --> 17:00.759
kidnappers and
bank robbers who have

17:00.885 --> 17:03.094
stolen up to and in excess of... Really?

17:04.888 --> 17:06.306
How many have you
apprehended?

17:06.390 --> 17:09.726
We have arrested and
arraigned 213 wanted felons.

17:09.810 --> 17:12.313
No, I mean you, Director
Hoover. How many?

17:12.396 --> 17:14.231
Well, as Director, I administer.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.401
How many have you
arrested personally?

17:22.366 --> 17:24.325
I have never arrested anybody.

17:26.411 --> 17:27.744
You've never arrested anybody.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.413
Well, of course not.
I am an administrator.

17:29.498 --> 17:31.584
With no field experience.

17:32.294 --> 17:35.296
You are shockingly
unqualified, aren't you, sir?

17:35.923 --> 17:37.382
You have never
personally conducted

17:37.466 --> 17:40.218
a criminal investigation
in the field in your life.

17:40.969 --> 17:42.428
I think you're a front.

17:43.639 --> 17:46.766
I think your prowess
as a lawman is a myth

17:46.850 --> 17:50.561
created from the hoopla of headlines
by Mr. Suydam, your publicist there.

17:50.646 --> 17:53.816
Crimebusters, G-men, you're
setting yourself up as a czar?

17:54.734 --> 17:56.068
That's running wild in my estimation.

17:56.152 --> 17:57.611
A crime is what runs wild.

17:57.696 --> 18:00.197
If this country requires
a Bureau such as yours,

18:00.281 --> 18:02.741
I question whether you are
the person fit to run it.

18:02.826 --> 18:06.370
Well, I will not be judged by a
kangaroo court of venal politicians.

18:06.454 --> 18:08.831
Your appropriation
increase is denied.

18:18.925 --> 18:20.592
Feed the following
to Walter Winchell.

18:20.677 --> 18:25.222
McKellar is a Neanderthal, and he is
on a personal vendetta to destroy me.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.474
We will not contest him
in his committee room.

18:27.559 --> 18:29.435
We will fight him on the front page.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.147
Where is John Dillinger?

18:41.157 --> 18:43.408
Agent Purvis, congratulations.

18:43.492 --> 18:45.076
Thank you, sir.

18:45.161 --> 18:47.120
May I ask why?
They're ready for him.

18:47.204 --> 18:49.791
This is Henry Suydam. He is
our expert in press relations.

18:49.876 --> 18:52.544
Congratulations
for Pretty Boy Floyd,

18:52.628 --> 18:54.880
for which you have
my personal gratitude.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.965
Second, you are, as of this moment,

18:57.049 --> 18:59.968
the Special Agent in Charge
of the Chicago field office.

19:00.052 --> 19:01.887
Are you up to that task, Agent Purvis?

19:01.971 --> 19:03.472
Absolutely, sir.

19:08.353 --> 19:09.771
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

19:10.397 --> 19:16.027
Today, I am declaring the United
States of America's first War on Crime.

19:17.029 --> 19:22.492
And I'd like to introduce one of our
finest G-men, Agent Melvin Purvis.

19:22.951 --> 19:25.536
Agent Purvis will be in charge
of the field office in Chicago,

19:25.621 --> 19:28.372
the center of the crime
wave sweeping America.

19:28.582 --> 19:32.835
His task will be to get Public
Enemy Number 1, John Dillinger.

19:33.545 --> 19:35.296
Director?
Mr. Purvis?

19:35.380 --> 19:36.756
Say a few words, would you?

19:40.469 --> 19:43.471
Mr. Purvis, how did you
run down Pretty Boy Floyd?

19:46.892 --> 19:47.976
Through an apple orchard.

19:50.313 --> 19:52.356
Mr. Tolson, when he's done, you
tell him if he needs anything,

19:52.440 --> 19:54.233
you'll get it for him.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.236
And tell him he may call me J. E.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.489
Yeah, but people say John Dillinger's
a lot smarter and a lot tougher.

20:00.573 --> 20:03.158
Well, nevertheless,
we will get him.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.868
What makes you so sure?

20:04.953 --> 20:06.831
We have two things
Dillinger does not.

20:06.915 --> 20:07.998
What are they?

20:08.083 --> 20:11.961
The Bureau's modern techniques
of fighting crime scientifically

20:12.045 --> 20:13.754
and the visionary leadership

20:13.839 --> 20:15.589
of our Director, J. Edgar Hoover.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.722
The broad over there is looking at me.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.266
She likes me.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.143
How you doing, sweetheart?

20:49.876 --> 20:51.710
Alvin. Good to see you.

20:51.794 --> 20:53.044
How you doing?

20:53.129 --> 20:54.421
Homer. Pete.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.886
Me, Freddy and Doc are
looking to snatch a fellow.

21:00.970 --> 21:05.308
He's a Saint Paul banker, Ed
Bremer. We need a few more hands.

21:06.685 --> 21:08.144
I don't like kidnapping.

21:08.896 --> 21:11.480
Well, robbing banks is getting tougher.

21:11.565 --> 21:13.566
The public don't like kidnapping.

21:13.650 --> 21:15.693
Who gives a damn
what the public likes?

21:15.777 --> 21:17.528
I do. I hide out among them.

21:17.613 --> 21:19.280
We gotta care what they think.

21:19.364 --> 21:21.824
We also got a mail train
we're looking at, too.

21:22.659 --> 21:26.414
By the way, if somebody was to get
pinched, who knows their way around?

21:27.499 --> 21:32.003
Syndicate lawyer named Piquett,
Louis Piquett. We all use him.

21:32.087 --> 21:33.838
What's it all about, this train?

21:34.506 --> 21:36.674
Needs two or three more real
right guys to stick it up.

21:36.759 --> 21:38.426
Be ready in a couple of months.

21:39.094 --> 21:43.182
About $1,700,000. It's a
Federal Reserve shipment.

21:44.309 --> 21:46.560
It's the kind of score
you go away on after.

21:47.646 --> 21:48.979
Where you gonna go?

21:49.689 --> 21:53.567
I don't know. Brazil,
Cuba. I like Varadero Beach.

21:54.235 --> 21:55.444
What about you?

21:56.237 --> 21:57.529
No plans.

21:58.031 --> 21:59.490
Yeah, well, you ought to.

22:00.408 --> 22:02.451
What we're doing
won't last forever.

22:03.286 --> 22:04.703
We're having too
good a time today.

22:04.788 --> 22:06.872
We ain't thinking
about tomorrow.

22:08.583 --> 22:11.794
Keep me in mind on the train,
would you? All right. Thanks.

22:14.339 --> 22:16.882
You know how much they made
taking that Hamm Brewery guy?

22:16.967 --> 22:19.051
$100,000. Simmer down, Homer.

22:19.511 --> 22:21.972
Come on, fellas.
Let's go to the bar.

22:22.056 --> 22:23.974
I got three broads
convinced I own the place.

22:25.226 --> 22:26.518
See you.

22:30.189 --> 22:31.898
Is Homer staying
steady enough?

22:32.900 --> 22:34.109
Homer's fine.

22:35.152 --> 22:36.861
One rule I learned
from Walter Dietrich,

22:36.946 --> 22:38.613
never work with people
who are desperate.

22:38.698 --> 22:41.410
Yeah, well, I got a rule,
too. Stay away from the women.

22:45.415 --> 22:47.457
Without women, it's
like back in the stir.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.668
That's why they
invented whores.

22:51.337 --> 22:52.546
Hey, hey, Anna.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.214
How are you doing, big boy?

22:54.298 --> 22:56.174
Who's this?
Veronica.

22:56.259 --> 22:57.718
Veronica, Red.

22:57.802 --> 22:59.594
Hi, Johnny.
Hey, Anna.

23:21.452 --> 23:24.037
I don't know why you gave
that fellow the go-by,

23:26.623 --> 23:28.124
but I'm awful glad you did.

23:29.126 --> 23:30.376
What's your name?

23:30.461 --> 23:31.586
Billie Frechette.

23:34.465 --> 23:35.673
Can I buy you a drink?

23:35.758 --> 23:36.883
Okay.

23:41.222 --> 23:42.681
You got a name?

23:45.435 --> 23:46.518
Yeah.

23:47.645 --> 23:49.480
Jack. You dance, Jack?

23:51.399 --> 23:52.691
I don't know how.

23:53.985 --> 23:55.027
Come on.

23:57.572 --> 23:59.533
How come you don't
know how to dance?

24:00.660 --> 24:01.827
Frechette.

24:02.746 --> 24:03.871
That French?

24:04.414 --> 24:07.833
On my father's side.
There's an "e" at the end.

24:08.668 --> 24:09.835
This is a two-step.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.004
Blackbird

24:15.342 --> 24:19.471
Where somebody waits for me

24:21.891 --> 24:26.520
Sugar's sweet, so is he

24:31.651 --> 24:34.611
Daddy's French.
What's on the other side?

24:37.532 --> 24:40.367
My mama's
a Menominee Indian, okay?

24:41.035 --> 24:42.786
Most men don't like that.

24:45.373 --> 24:46.456
I ain't most men.

24:46.541 --> 24:47.624
Yeah?

24:48.626 --> 24:52.254
And I've been a dice girl, and I
check coats at the Steuben Club.

24:57.636 --> 24:59.053
And what do you do?

25:02.015 --> 25:03.474
I'm catching up.

25:06.562 --> 25:08.062
Meeting somebody like you,

25:09.898 --> 25:11.315
dark and beautiful,

25:14.528 --> 25:16.030
like that bird in that song.

25:16.740 --> 25:22.370
Blackbird, bye-bye

25:24.123 --> 25:28.585
No one here can love

25:30.254 --> 25:34.507
Or understand me

25:38.930 --> 25:40.139
You cold?

26:05.207 --> 26:07.458
What is it exactly
you do for a living?

26:09.753 --> 26:11.754
I'm John Dillinger. I rob banks.

26:15.635 --> 26:18.220
That's where all these
people here put their money.

26:20.139 --> 26:21.765
Why did you tell me that?

26:23.476 --> 26:24.935
You could have made up a story.

26:25.019 --> 26:26.561
I'm not gonna lie to you.

26:28.147 --> 26:31.066
That's a serious thing to
say to a girl you just met.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.317
I know you.

26:32.401 --> 26:33.946
Well, I don't know you.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.407
I haven't been anyplace.

26:37.492 --> 26:39.826
Well, some of the places
I've been ain't so hot.

26:42.163 --> 26:44.456
Where I'm going is
a whole lot better.

26:45.583 --> 26:46.750
Want to come along?

26:47.335 --> 26:49.169
Boy, you are in a hurry!

26:49.837 --> 26:53.049
If you were looking at what I'm
looking at, you'd be in a hurry, too.

26:53.467 --> 26:54.592
Well,

26:55.386 --> 26:57.595
it's me they're looking at this time.

26:58.347 --> 26:59.514
You're beautiful.

27:00.015 --> 27:01.933
They're looking at me
because they're not used to

27:02.017 --> 27:03.851
having a girl in their restaurant

27:03.936 --> 27:05.687
in a $3 dress.

27:07.648 --> 27:08.815
Listen, doll.

27:09.775 --> 27:12.610
That's 'cause they're all
about where people come from.

27:14.196 --> 27:17.115
The only thing that's important
is where somebody's going.

27:19.034 --> 27:20.493
Where are you going?

27:22.788 --> 27:24.205
Anywhere I want.

27:32.299 --> 27:33.716
Let's get out of here.

27:46.313 --> 27:47.563
Hey, Johnny!

27:52.029 --> 27:53.446
Go wait for me outside.

28:02.456 --> 28:03.539
Gil.

28:05.625 --> 28:08.586
Ever since I got out, I've
been working for Frank Nitti.

28:08.670 --> 28:11.840
These guys are connected to
everybody all over the country now.

28:13.384 --> 28:14.718
He looks like a barber.

28:27.148 --> 28:31.610
Phil D'Andrea. Every time I
read about one of your bank jobs

28:31.694 --> 28:34.446
where you give the customers
back their money, you crack me up.

28:36.616 --> 28:38.825
You need anything, ask Gilbert.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.535
Gilbert knows how to find me.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.120
Thank you.

28:58.472 --> 29:00.098
Where'd that girl go?
I don't know, sir.

29:00.182 --> 29:01.974
She jumped in a cab
and took off.

29:06.730 --> 29:08.064
<i>This is Lowell Thomas.</i>

29:08.150 --> 29:09.776
<i>From West Virginia comes accusations</i>

29:09.860 --> 29:12.237
<i>by the Carnegie Coal company
of Red influence</i>

29:12.321 --> 29:13.988
<i>on the United Mine Workers' strike.</i>

29:14.073 --> 29:17.617
<i>Meanwhile, in Racine, Wisconsin,
after raiding the American Trust Bank,</i>

29:17.701 --> 29:19.994
<i>Public Enemy Number 1,
John Dillinger,</i>

29:20.079 --> 29:23.081
<i>roams the wilds pursued
by the hounds of justice.</i>

29:23.165 --> 29:26.587
<i>And in Geneva, the League of Nations
voted the USSR full membership.</i>

29:26.669 --> 29:29.547
According to the bank
teller, Barbara Patzke,

29:29.631 --> 29:31.966
this is John Dillinger's coat.

29:32.050 --> 29:34.844
It's made by Shragge
Quality out of St. Louis.

29:34.928 --> 29:39.557
Price, $35, windproof
32-ounce wool. Top stitching.

29:40.434 --> 29:41.809
Thank you, Agent Baum.

29:45.272 --> 29:47.189
Agents in our offices
across the country

29:48.400 --> 29:52.236
are identifying every store in the
United States that sold this overcoat.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.698
Then we will cross-reference
every Dillinger associate

29:55.782 --> 29:58.325
at locales where
that coat was sold.

29:58.994 --> 30:00.286
He was in a place.

30:01.121 --> 30:02.830
He got cold. He bought a coat.

30:03.874 --> 30:05.666
Unless he was traveling through,

30:06.836 --> 30:08.587
he was being harbored nearby.

30:08.671 --> 30:10.338
If he returns, we will be there.

30:12.216 --> 30:16.928
It is by such methods that our
Bureau will get John Dillinger.

30:17.847 --> 30:19.848
Now, Doris,
would you please contact

30:19.932 --> 30:23.226
the Chicago area telephone
exchange supervisors. There are six.

30:23.311 --> 30:25.437
Request appointments for
Carter Baum and myself.

30:27.192 --> 30:28.400
Gentlemen,

30:29.235 --> 30:34.406
shortly you will be provided
Thompson submachine guns, BARs

30:34.491 --> 30:37.576
and a .351 Winchester
semi-automatic rifle.

30:41.915 --> 30:45.752
We are pursuing hardened
killers. They will be dangerous.

30:46.921 --> 30:49.756
And those of you who aren't
prepared for that should go.

30:51.926 --> 30:54.219
And if you are going
to go, please go now.

30:58.349 --> 31:00.225
This is a phone call conversation

31:00.309 --> 31:03.394
from a car dealership
from 27 minutes ago.

31:03.479 --> 31:04.479
Harry Berman.

31:05.356 --> 31:08.274
When you drop it, leave
the keys on the floorboard.

31:08.359 --> 31:10.527
<i>I got a DeSoto.
Okay.</i>

31:10.611 --> 31:12.195
<i>Interior's no good.</i>

31:12.613 --> 31:13.947
How did we get to Berman?

31:14.031 --> 31:15.323
Off the Dillinger coat.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.075
The coat was bought
in Cicero, Illinois,

31:17.159 --> 31:19.452
a few doors down from
Berman's dealership.

31:19.537 --> 31:23.373
Now, we know Berman. He's been supplying
cars to the Syndicate since Capone.

31:23.457 --> 31:25.251
When Dillinger bought that coat,

31:25.335 --> 31:27.211
he must have been at
Berman's switching cars.

31:27.295 --> 31:30.005
As soon as they call to drop
the DeSoto, we'll tail it.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.690
I want men on this...

31:31.900 --> 31:33.467
around the clock.

31:43.605 --> 31:44.730
May I check your coat, sir?

31:44.815 --> 31:46.023
Yes, thank you.

31:48.026 --> 31:49.151
You ran out on me.

31:49.236 --> 31:51.028
You left me standing
on the sidewalk.

31:51.113 --> 31:52.572
If you're gonna be my girl,

31:52.656 --> 31:55.908
you're gonna have to swear to me
that you'll never ever do that again.

31:55.993 --> 31:58.202
Hey, I'm not your girl.
Brown overcoat.

31:58.287 --> 31:59.579
And I'm not
gonna say that.

31:59.663 --> 32:01.747
I'm waiting.
So am I.

32:01.832 --> 32:05.127
"I'm never gonna run out on
you ever again." Say the words.

32:05.211 --> 32:06.920
No.
My coat.

32:07.005 --> 32:09.214
Well, I ain't ever gonna run
out on you, and that's a promise.

32:09.299 --> 32:11.550
Well, I want to run
out of here, so, lady...

32:29.235 --> 32:31.820
Hit the road, sport.
Keep the tip.

32:33.656 --> 32:36.783
You ain't getting other people's
hats and coats no more neither.

32:36.868 --> 32:38.118
Why'd you do that?

32:38.202 --> 32:39.953
'Cause you're with me now.

32:40.038 --> 32:42.081
I don't know anything about you.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.792
I was raised on a farm
in Mooresville, Indiana.

32:44.877 --> 32:46.002
My mama died when I was 3.

32:46.086 --> 32:49.631
My daddy beat the hell out of me 'cause
he didn't know no better way to raise me.

32:49.715 --> 32:54.969
I like baseball, movies, good
clothes, fast cars, whiskey and you.

32:56.305 --> 32:57.972
What else you need to know?

33:34.137 --> 33:35.429
Have a seat.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.392
You been living here long?

33:39.476 --> 33:40.643
Yeah.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.603
Since yesterday.

33:46.858 --> 33:47.900
Hey.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.123
I got you something.

35:02.855 --> 35:04.022
When I was a girl,

35:04.106 --> 35:06.608
we went to live on the
reservation in Flandreau

35:06.692 --> 35:08.526
'cause my daddy died.

35:10.738 --> 35:13.281
In Flandreau,
nothing ever happened.

35:13.365 --> 35:17.787
And when I was 13, I went to live
in Milwaukee with my Aunt Ines.

35:19.998 --> 35:22.208
We had a lot of
Indian friends,

35:23.210 --> 35:26.170
and we went around to
churches and put on plays.

35:28.965 --> 35:31.717
And nothing exciting ever
happened there, either.

35:32.385 --> 35:36.808
So I haven't been anywhere or done
anything except come to Chicago

35:37.559 --> 35:39.727
and try to make my way.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.169
You're all packed.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.552
Well, baby,

36:16.266 --> 36:17.975
I'm gonna take you with me.

36:21.855 --> 36:25.065
And you're gonna start a whole
new exciting kind of life.

36:31.614 --> 36:32.906
And what do you want?

36:36.787 --> 36:38.121
Everything.

36:41.458 --> 36:42.667
Right now.

36:49.300 --> 36:50.717
Purvis.

36:50.801 --> 36:54.097
Berman dropped the DeSoto at
Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago.

36:54.724 --> 36:58.768
Men go in and out of an apartment
rented to a Miss Vi Scott.

36:59.186 --> 37:02.355
They carry heavy suitcases. One
of them looks like Dillinger.

37:10.323 --> 37:11.406
Where are your men?

37:11.490 --> 37:13.576
In cars on Clarendon
and Wilson Avenue.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.161
Blocking vehicles?
The alley?

37:15.245 --> 37:18.456
Who has a line of sight
on the DeSoto to you?

37:25.213 --> 37:28.633
Are they aware that we are
here? Any rapid movements?

37:28.717 --> 37:29.842
No.

37:32.137 --> 37:33.179
Carter,

37:34.514 --> 37:37.433
you keep an eye on
the DeSoto from there.

37:41.313 --> 37:42.855
Barton, you're with me.

38:13.682 --> 38:14.807
Yes?

38:16.226 --> 38:19.395
I'm Special Agent Melvin
Purvis, Miss Scott.

38:20.188 --> 38:21.188
Are you here by yourself?

38:21.272 --> 38:23.482
No. I'm here with my fiancé.

38:23.566 --> 38:24.984
And what is your fiancé's name?

38:25.068 --> 38:27.111
Leonard McHenry.

38:29.573 --> 38:30.657
May we come in?

38:30.741 --> 38:31.825
Well, please.

38:31.909 --> 38:33.785
I'm perfectly safe,
but come on in.

38:38.165 --> 38:39.332
Something wrong?

38:40.334 --> 38:41.835
You have identification?

38:43.295 --> 38:44.546
Yeah, sure.

38:44.922 --> 38:48.633
Honey, would you get my driver's
license? It's in my jacket pocket.

38:48.718 --> 38:49.759
Sure.

38:51.012 --> 38:52.137
I know you.

38:53.139 --> 38:54.305
You're...

38:54.598 --> 38:56.808
You're Melvin Purvis. Right?

38:58.060 --> 39:00.311
Yeah. I seen your picture.

39:01.856 --> 39:03.898
And what do you do
for a living, Leonard?

39:04.442 --> 39:05.984
I travel in ladies' shoes.

39:07.486 --> 39:08.696
Show him, honey.

39:10.490 --> 39:11.866
Cute, huh?

39:15.704 --> 39:19.623
Well, you enjoy the rest
of your dinner, Mr. McHenry.

39:20.417 --> 39:21.751
Thanks.
Good night.

39:30.804 --> 39:33.681
No one in or out. I'll get
the others. You stay here.

39:33.766 --> 39:36.142
You watch that door
from right there.

39:42.316 --> 39:43.775
Get the men
from Sheridan.

40:13.348 --> 40:16.683
Bureau of Investigation.
What's your name?

40:18.228 --> 40:19.686
You wanna know my name?

40:28.030 --> 40:29.197
Come on.

40:31.158 --> 40:33.409
Baum, you keep an eye
on the alley.

40:45.216 --> 40:46.424
Barton?

40:48.344 --> 40:49.469
Barton.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.012
Where is he?

41:42.191 --> 41:43.609
They're headed east!

41:44.277 --> 41:45.777
Who was in the blocking car?

41:45.862 --> 41:47.196
That was us.

41:49.282 --> 41:52.117
We heard gunfire
so we came here.

41:54.996 --> 41:56.663
Who was it? Dillinger?

42:00.293 --> 42:03.047
The man we let get away
wasn't John Dillinger.

42:03.131 --> 42:05.090
That was Baby Face Nelson.

42:31.410 --> 42:32.869
Get on the floor!
Now! Go!

42:32.954 --> 42:34.329
Y'all get up against that wall.

42:34.413 --> 42:36.456
Go on, all of you.
- This is a stick-up! Up!

42:36.624 --> 42:38.416
Put them up! Up!

42:38.501 --> 42:40.043
Down on the floor,
now! Down!

42:40.127 --> 42:41.628
Put them up! Come on.
Put them up!

42:41.712 --> 42:43.129
This is a stick-up!

42:43.714 --> 42:45.173
Let's go. Come on.
Up!

42:45.258 --> 42:46.883
Where I can see them, up!

42:47.927 --> 42:50.512
Customers, stay calm.
Don't move.

42:51.806 --> 42:53.181
Hey! You! Up!

42:54.517 --> 42:57.852
<i>Hands up!
Move! Empty it!</i>

42:59.105 --> 43:01.691
John Dillinger held up
a bank for $74,000

43:01.775 --> 43:03.985
while you failed to arrest Nelson.

43:04.403 --> 43:06.195
Sir, I take full responsibility.

43:07.739 --> 43:09.615
And I would like
to make a request.

43:09.992 --> 43:12.535
<i>That we transfer men with
special qualifications</i>

43:12.619 --> 43:14.537
<i>to augment the staff
here in Chicago.</i>

43:14.830 --> 43:16.622
There are some former
Texas and Oklahoma lawmen

43:16.707 --> 43:18.916
currently with the Bureau in Dallas.

43:19.712 --> 43:22.046
<i>I thought you understood
what I'm building.</i>

43:22.631 --> 43:25.675
A modern force of professional
young men of the best sort.

43:27.344 --> 43:29.512
I'm afraid our type
cannot get the job done.

43:30.639 --> 43:31.681
Excuse me, I cannot hear you.

43:31.765 --> 43:34.642
<i>Our type cannot get the job done.</i>

43:34.727 --> 43:36.102
I cannot hear you.

43:37.187 --> 43:39.773
Our type cannot
get the job done.

43:41.151 --> 43:42.234
<i>Without qualified help,</i>

43:43.528 --> 43:44.778
I would have to resign
this appointment.

43:44.863 --> 43:47.156
Otherwise, I am leading
my men to slaughter.

43:50.535 --> 43:52.703
Mr. Tolson will call you,
Agent Purvis.

44:22.860 --> 44:24.110
Did he say what he looked like?

44:24.195 --> 44:25.403
Didn't say.

44:25.488 --> 44:26.529
You gentlemen need any help?

44:26.614 --> 44:27.697
Thank you, no.

44:44.092 --> 44:45.425
Shine?
Morning.

44:45.510 --> 44:47.469
How you doing?
I'm doing all right.

44:51.182 --> 44:52.599
Agent Winstead?

44:53.184 --> 44:54.976
That's right.
It's a pleasure.

44:55.395 --> 44:59.107
Welcome to Chicago. We have a lot
of work to do here on Mr. Dillinger.

44:59.191 --> 45:00.983
Another time.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

45:01.068 --> 45:02.276
Have a nice day.

45:23.507 --> 45:27.009
Put Johnny Patton down front
on the other four tracks.

45:30.097 --> 45:31.139
It's hot out, right?

45:31.223 --> 45:32.640
Yes, Frank.

45:33.016 --> 45:35.561
Ever since those pricks
shot me, I can't get warm.

45:38.356 --> 45:39.440
What?

45:39.524 --> 45:41.316
Some people from
Chicago over there.

45:50.201 --> 45:51.410
Johnny.

45:51.953 --> 45:53.871
What do you say we meet you
in Tucson around the 25th?

45:53.955 --> 45:55.541
Okay.
All right.

45:55.625 --> 45:57.751
I heard one today.
Indiana paper,

45:57.836 --> 46:01.005
"Wanted, John Dillinger,
dead or dead."

46:04.801 --> 46:07.678
I think we wore out
the Midwest for a while.

46:12.225 --> 46:13.267
What?

46:13.351 --> 46:16.980
Come out to the Colonial tonight.
It's our joint. Be my guest.

46:17.565 --> 46:19.316
The best steaks in Miami.

46:20.735 --> 46:21.985
You're not gonna
take our picture, are you?

46:22.069 --> 46:23.737
No pictures.

46:23.821 --> 46:25.238
All right. We'll be there.

46:27.158 --> 46:29.117
Thank you for taking me
on this trip.

46:30.411 --> 46:32.704
You going somewhere, doll?
Am I?

46:33.581 --> 46:35.624
No.
Don't kid a kidder.

46:35.708 --> 46:37.834
Then don't play me for a fool.

46:37.919 --> 46:40.921
We both know I end up back
checking coats at the Steuben Club,

46:41.005 --> 46:42.339
one way or the other.

46:42.423 --> 46:43.715
What does that mean?

46:43.925 --> 46:47.344
You don't think past today
or tomorrow. And eventually,

46:47.428 --> 46:49.012
they will catch you or kill you

46:49.096 --> 46:51.556
and I don't want to be
there when that happens.

46:52.809 --> 46:53.976
Who gave you a crystal ball?

46:54.061 --> 46:55.853
I don't need one.

46:55.938 --> 46:57.313
Ask Homer.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.273
Ask Homer what?

46:59.358 --> 47:01.943
And his goddamn joke,
"dead or dead."

47:07.324 --> 47:09.951
You ain't going nowhere,
you hear me?

47:10.369 --> 47:12.413
I'm gonna die an old man
in your arms.

47:12.957 --> 47:14.415
We're too good for them.

47:15.125 --> 47:17.752
They ain't tough enough,
smart enough or fast enough.

47:18.504 --> 47:20.380
I hit any bank I want any time.

47:20.464 --> 47:23.675
They got to be at
every bank all the time.

47:25.177 --> 47:27.095
That's why we're
on top of the world.

47:27.930 --> 47:29.681
Ain't nobody
lay a glove on us.

47:30.558 --> 47:31.725
No.

47:32.978 --> 47:36.397
I ain't going nowhere.
Neither are you.

47:37.399 --> 47:38.983
What do you got
to say about that?

48:14.645 --> 48:15.979
Hi, folks.

48:16.397 --> 48:19.816
Afternoon. Got a reservation for
a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan.

48:24.697 --> 48:27.157
I can send up some sandwiches
and beer if you like.

48:27.241 --> 48:28.533
That'd be swell.

48:29.035 --> 48:30.621
Some friends of mine
should be here already,

48:30.705 --> 48:32.706
a J.C. Davies and a Mr. Clark?

48:33.207 --> 48:35.083
Out shopping, I believe.

48:35.168 --> 48:36.668
I'll let them know you're
in when they get back.

48:36.753 --> 48:37.878
Okey-doke.

48:40.673 --> 48:42.466
The elevator's
right down that way.

48:42.550 --> 48:44.009
Thank you very much.

49:18.379 --> 49:20.463
You look like you
could use some company.

49:21.965 --> 49:25.218
How's about me and my friend Prince
Albert come and pay you a visit?

49:27.012 --> 49:29.556
Get on in here, both of you.

49:38.650 --> 49:42.194
Johnny! Johnny!

49:45.615 --> 49:47.326
Put some clothes on, miss.

49:52.624 --> 49:54.166
What the hell
happened, boys?

49:54.835 --> 49:56.711
There was a fire in the hotel.

49:59.464 --> 50:02.216
Firemen found our guns.
They called the cops.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.342
Where they taking you?

50:03.427 --> 50:04.927
We're getting
shanghaied to Ohio.

50:05.011 --> 50:06.138
Where's Billie?

50:15.648 --> 50:18.066
Your girl's been put on
a bus back to Chicago.

50:18.151 --> 50:19.901
We ain't holding her.

50:41.174 --> 50:42.507
Right this way.

50:53.604 --> 50:54.812
Well,

50:57.858 --> 51:00.359
here's the man who
killed Pretty Boy Floyd.

51:01.570 --> 51:04.866
Damn good thing he was pretty,
'cause he sure wasn't Whiz Kid Floyd.

51:10.915 --> 51:12.540
Tell me something,
Mr. Purvis.

51:13.125 --> 51:16.211
That fellow, the one who got
killed at the Sherone Apartments,

51:19.173 --> 51:21.382
the newspaper said
you found him alive.

51:25.013 --> 51:26.472
It's the eyes, ain't it?

51:28.683 --> 51:30.643
They look at you
right before they go.

51:34.606 --> 51:38.234
And then they just
drift away into nothing.

51:43.114 --> 51:44.865
That'll keep you up nights.

51:47.702 --> 51:49.912
And what keeps you up
nights, Mr. Dillinger?

51:54.543 --> 51:55.751
Coffee.

52:02.426 --> 52:05.136
You act like a confident
man, Mr. Purvis.

52:05.221 --> 52:06.763
You got a few qualities.

52:07.223 --> 52:09.516
Probably pretty good
from a distance,

52:09.600 --> 52:12.018
especially when you got
the fellow outnumbered.

52:12.103 --> 52:13.770
But up close, toe to toe,

52:14.438 --> 52:17.440
when somebody's about to
die right here, right now,

52:20.611 --> 52:21.947
I'm used to that.

52:23.575 --> 52:24.783
What about you?

52:25.785 --> 52:27.119
Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.

52:28.329 --> 52:29.913
I'll see you down the road.

52:33.209 --> 52:34.751
No, you will not.

52:37.297 --> 52:39.131
The only way that you
will leave a jail cell

52:39.215 --> 52:41.676
is when we take you out
to execute you.

52:44.513 --> 52:46.514
Well, we'll see about that.

52:49.602 --> 52:52.061
You ought to get yourself
another line of work, Melvin.

53:02.406 --> 53:05.199
Hey, I was just kidding.

53:06.035 --> 53:08.369
I believe I'm gonna let you
boys keep me here a while.

53:10.289 --> 53:13.458
We'd like that, Johnny, but
don't get too comfortable.

53:14.126 --> 53:15.543
They're moving you.

53:15.628 --> 53:16.628
Where to?

53:16.712 --> 53:18.004
Indiana.

53:19.549 --> 53:20.716
Why?

53:21.843 --> 53:24.678
I have absolutely nothing
I want to do in Indiana.

56:09.852 --> 56:11.019
He's here.

56:16.820 --> 56:18.987
Back up, fellas.
Back up.

56:24.494 --> 56:27.538
We'll take custody now.
Take the manacles off.

56:35.548 --> 56:36.965
Are you glad
to see Indiana again?

56:37.049 --> 56:38.967
About as glad as Indiana
is to see me, I suppose.

56:40.177 --> 56:42.470
Did you smuggle the guns into
Indiana State Penitentiary

56:42.555 --> 56:44.305
for the big break
of September 26th?

56:44.390 --> 56:46.558
Right now, you're
too inquisitive, buddy.

56:47.393 --> 56:48.810
Put your arm
around Dillinger.

56:52.731 --> 56:55.066
Hey, when was the last time
you were in Mooresville?

56:56.068 --> 56:57.360
Ten years ago.

56:58.487 --> 57:01.906
I was a wild boy, and,
well, I was foolish.

57:02.867 --> 57:03.908
I held up a grocery store,

57:03.993 --> 57:07.245
which I never should have done
'cause Mr. Morgan was a good man.

57:07.955 --> 57:12.418
And they sentenced me to 10 years in
the state penitentiary for a $50 theft.

57:15.213 --> 57:18.215
When I was in prison,
I met a lot of good fellows.

57:19.050 --> 57:20.342
So sure, yeah,

57:21.303 --> 57:24.054
I helped set up the break
at Michigan City. Why not?

57:24.598 --> 57:27.099
I stick with my pals
and my pals stick with me.

57:27.475 --> 57:30.144
Johnny, how long does it
take you to go through a bank?

57:31.231 --> 57:35.151
Oh, about one minute,
40 seconds.

57:35.235 --> 57:36.194
Flat.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.363
Let's go.

58:00.929 --> 58:02.679
Mr. Johnny, your lawyer's here.

58:19.322 --> 58:22.282
You come highly recommended
by Alvin Karpis.

58:23.743 --> 58:26.078
At the arraignment,

58:26.162 --> 58:29.374
they're gonna try and
transfer me to the state pen.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.293
What can you do for me?

58:33.003 --> 58:34.545
What's on your mind?

58:36.131 --> 58:37.507
The electric chair.

58:50.606 --> 58:54.192
Your Honor, are we to have an arraignment
in accord with the laws of this nation

58:54.277 --> 58:58.863
or is the State to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice?

58:59.282 --> 59:03.243
The very air reeks with the
bloody rancor of intolerant malice!

59:03.661 --> 59:06.955
The clanging of shackles
brings to our minds

59:07.039 --> 59:08.624
the dungeons of the czars,

59:08.709 --> 59:11.627
not the flag-bedecked liberty
of an American courtroom.

59:11.712 --> 59:15.089
I request the court to direct that
those shackles be removed forthwith.

59:15.173 --> 59:17.133
This is a very dangerous
man, Your Honor.

59:17.217 --> 59:19.010
And I'm responsible for the
safeguarding of this prisoner.

59:19.094 --> 59:22.471
Are you a lawyer? What right do
you have to address this court?

59:22.556 --> 59:26.350
All right. Remove the
shackles from the prisoner.

59:26.893 --> 59:30.313
Your Honor, we would like
to relocate the prisoner.

59:30.397 --> 59:32.773
Only Indiana State
Penitentiary in Michigan City

59:32.858 --> 59:35.276
can guarantee
Dillinger will not escape.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.028
Sheriff Holley?
I concur, Your Honor.

59:37.112 --> 59:40.281
Sheriff Holley, I think this is a
very nice jail you have right here.

59:40.365 --> 59:42.491
What makes you think there's
something wrong with it?

59:42.576 --> 59:44.035
There's nothing wrong with my jail.

59:44.119 --> 59:45.536
It's the strongest jail in Indiana.

59:45.620 --> 59:47.372
That's what I thought.

59:47.457 --> 59:50.292
But of course, I don't want
to embarrass Mrs. Holley.

59:50.585 --> 59:53.337
I appreciate she's a woman
and she's afraid of an escape.

59:53.421 --> 59:55.255
Oh, no. I'm not afraid
of an escape.

59:55.340 --> 59:58.467
I can take care of John
Dillinger or any other prisoner.

01:00:00.928 --> 01:00:02.137
Okay.

01:00:02.805 --> 01:00:04.222
Dillinger will stay here.

01:00:04.307 --> 01:00:05.766
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.063
The defense will need four
months to prepare itself.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:10.939
It should take 10 days.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:14.318
To go to trial in 10 days would
be a legal lynching of this lad.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:15.652
There's a law against lynching.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:16.904
There's a law against murder!

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.781
Then observe the law part.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:22.368
Or just stand Dillinger
up against a wall

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.162
and shoot him.
Just shoot him.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:28.083
Then there's no need to throw away
the State's money on this mockery.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.584
Calm down.

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:32.170
I apologize to the court.

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:35.298
Bob and I respect
each other very much.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.469
Watch out or he'll be putting
his arm around you, too.

01:00:41.889 --> 01:00:44.265
Trial starts in one
month on March 12th.

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:50.355
Attaboy, counselor.

01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:30.398
Open the gate.

01:01:38.949 --> 01:01:40.199
Hey, Cahoon!

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:44.204
Come here a minute.

01:01:48.376 --> 01:01:49.918
Come on, Sam.

01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.421
You and me's going places.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.679
Call Bryant.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:03.056
Bryant?

01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:17.070
Call Max.

01:02:17.822 --> 01:02:20.115
I'll kill you if I have
to. Don't think I won't.

01:02:22.578 --> 01:02:23.745
Open up!

01:03:03.997 --> 01:03:05.581
I'll plug him right here.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:13.714
Open the gun safe.
Go on. Open it up!

01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:31.333
Lock up the warden.

01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:33.085
That wasn't real, was it?

01:03:39.385 --> 01:03:40.594
Let's go.

01:04:03.328 --> 01:04:04.369
Put your hands up!

01:04:04.454 --> 01:04:06.371
Which one of these
here cars is the fastest?

01:04:06.456 --> 01:04:08.916
That would be that Ford right
there. It's got the new V-8.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.834
We're gonna take
that one. Go on.

01:04:14.172 --> 01:04:16.924
That's Sheriff Lillian
Holley's personal car.

01:04:17.008 --> 01:04:18.134
Good.

01:05:39.887 --> 01:05:42.723
Mr. Youngblood,
are we clear now?

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:45.475
We are.

01:05:58.489 --> 01:05:59.740
Okay, then.

01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:02.909
Oh, come on, buddy.

01:06:04.996 --> 01:06:07.497
You gotta relax a little bit.
Just take it easy.

01:06:07.582 --> 01:06:10.751
Do you know the words
to The Last Round-Up?

01:06:12.462 --> 01:06:14.547
<i>Get along, little dogies</i>

01:06:14.631 --> 01:06:16.466
<i>Get along, get along</i>

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:19.260
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along</i>

01:06:19.762 --> 01:06:23.848
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along</i>

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.101
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along</i>

01:06:28.771 --> 01:06:32.942
<i>I'm a-headed for
the last round-up</i>

01:06:34.028 --> 01:06:35.904
How did he act?
Was he jolly?

01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:37.781
Yes. He sang
part of the way.

01:06:39.033 --> 01:06:43.787
<i>Get along, little dogies
Get along, get along</i>

01:06:44.288 --> 01:06:47.207
<i>While in Washington today,
President Roosevelt said,</i>

01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.917
<i>"John Dillinger
is making a mockery</i>

01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:51.294
<i>"of the system of justice
in this country."</i>

01:06:52.004 --> 01:06:55.549
<i>The passing of John J. McGraw, long-time
manager of the New York Giants...</i>

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.977
Hello.
Hey, doll, it's me.

01:07:07.062 --> 01:07:08.854
Look, I can't talk long.
You okay?

01:07:08.939 --> 01:07:09.980
Yeah.

01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:12.566
I heard it on the radio.
How about you?

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:14.402
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:07:15.153 --> 01:07:16.821
Don't come to Chicago, Johnny.

01:07:17.906 --> 01:07:19.490
What's that supposed to mean?

01:07:20.492 --> 01:07:22.034
I promised I'd look after you,
didn't I?

01:07:22.119 --> 01:07:23.327
Yes.

01:07:23.412 --> 01:07:24.703
Well, then that's
what I'm gonna do.

01:07:26.456 --> 01:07:27.748
You know that, don't you?

01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:29.166
Yes.

01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:33.046
Look, I think
they're watching me.

01:07:34.841 --> 01:07:36.925
I'm gonna come get you out
of there and take care of you.

01:07:38.219 --> 01:07:39.553
Baby, don't come to Chicago!

01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:40.887
Say you know it.

01:07:44.267 --> 01:07:45.684
Say it.

01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:50.607
I know you will take care of me.

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:55.779
I love you.

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:20.220
Sooner or later,

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:23.224
she will go to him

01:08:24.602 --> 01:08:26.560
or he is gonna come for her.

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:49.585
Say, Sport! Mr. Johnny, you
got to hold it right there.

01:08:54.508 --> 01:08:57.051
Can't stay here
no more, Mr. Johnny.

01:09:00.138 --> 01:09:01.346
Says who?

01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:04.433
Sport's only following orders.
So am I.

01:09:04.518 --> 01:09:06.685
They thought you might come here.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:08.939
I don't get it.

01:09:09.816 --> 01:09:11.526
Talk to your pal Gilbert.

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:12.944
About what?

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:15.363
You gotta talk to Gilbert Catena.

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:30.796
Come on. Come on, get out
of here! Beat it! Scram!

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.466
The welcome mat was not out.

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:37.301
I kept hearing your name.
Now, I'm going to ask you once.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:39.638
And I just did.

01:10:02.787 --> 01:10:04.246
Anybody see him come in?

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.539
I don't think so.

01:10:15.718 --> 01:10:17.468
You want to know
if we're armed?

01:10:18.596 --> 01:10:19.846
We're armed.

01:10:23.017 --> 01:10:24.225
Calm down.

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:28.064
Calm down. Calm down.

01:10:30.151 --> 01:10:31.484
Hey, back to work.

01:10:34.322 --> 01:10:35.530
What's the deal, Phil?

01:10:35.615 --> 01:10:37.616
Look around. What do you see?

01:10:38.868 --> 01:10:39.951
A whole bunch of telephones.

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:41.077
You see money.

01:10:41.954 --> 01:10:44.039
Last month, there were
independent wire services

01:10:44.123 --> 01:10:47.793
letting bookies know who won the
third race at Sportsman's Park,

01:10:47.878 --> 01:10:52.214
300 of them nationwide.
Now there's only one, ours.

01:10:52.966 --> 01:10:55.801
On October 23rd, you robbed a
bank in Greencastle, Indiana.

01:10:55.886 --> 01:10:58.763
You got away with $74,802.

01:10:58.847 --> 01:11:00.806
You thought that was a big score.

01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:02.850
These phones make that every day.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:06.479
And it keeps getting made,
day after day after day,

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:09.982
a river of money, and
it gets deeper and wider,

01:11:10.067 --> 01:11:14.362
week in and week out, month in
and month out, flowing right to us.

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:20.534
Unless the cops
come through that door.

01:11:20.619 --> 01:11:22.578
Which you pay them not to do.

01:11:22.996 --> 01:11:24.122
Right.

01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:27.459
Unless you're around.

01:11:27.543 --> 01:11:30.379
Then they gotta come through
that door no matter what.

01:11:30.463 --> 01:11:31.797
What does that tell you?

01:11:31.881 --> 01:11:33.131
I'm popular.

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.343
It tells us you're bad for business.

01:11:37.428 --> 01:11:39.513
So the Syndicate's got a new policy.

01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:44.228
All the guys like you,
Karpis, Nelson, Campbell,

01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:48.148
we ain't laundering your
money or bonds no more.

01:11:48.233 --> 01:11:50.526
You ain't holing up in
our whorehouses anymore.

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:55.948
No armorers, no doctors, no safe
havens, no nothing. You get it?

01:12:02.331 --> 01:12:04.958
Personally, you need
something to tide you over?

01:12:11.048 --> 01:12:12.382
Good luck to you.

01:12:15.845 --> 01:12:19.222
Hamilton has a 34-year-old
sister in Detroit. Arrest her.

01:12:19.306 --> 01:12:23.601
Pick up all known Dillinger
associates, doctors, family,

01:12:23.686 --> 01:12:25.729
Pierpont's mother in Indianapolis,

01:12:25.813 --> 01:12:27.731
Dillinger's family in Mooresville.

01:12:27.815 --> 01:12:29.983
We suspect them of harboring.

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:33.153
But Hamilton's family has not
had word from Red in years.

01:12:33.654 --> 01:12:35.989
You convince them to get word.

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:38.575
Create informants, Agent Purvis.

01:12:38.659 --> 01:12:41.495
The suspects are to be
interrogated vigorously, grilled,

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.956
no obsolete notions
of sentimentality.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:46.083
We are in the modern age.
We are making history.

01:12:46.168 --> 01:12:48.419
Take direct, expedient action.

01:12:48.503 --> 01:12:51.589
As they say in Italy these days,
"Take off the white gloves!"

01:12:52.174 --> 01:12:54.467
Do we understand each
other, Agent Purvis?

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:03.352
These are fine young men
here. What's your name, son?

01:13:03.437 --> 01:13:04.520
Harris.

01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:08.941
G- men all over the country
have picked up the gauntlet

01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:11.652
flung down by the outlaws
and the wanton murderers.

01:13:11.737 --> 01:13:13.070
And these junior
crime fighters here,

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.782
these Junior G-men, has,
every one of them,

01:13:15.866 --> 01:13:17.700
stopped some crime
from occurring

01:13:17.785 --> 01:13:20.829
and forestalled an entry into
the black book of criminal deeds.

01:13:21.247 --> 01:13:23.665
Today, I am rewarding them
with these medals.

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:26.460
My friend Harris here is
the first. Well done, son.

01:13:26.544 --> 01:13:28.962
You can size up a score like
nobody's business, Tommy.

01:13:29.047 --> 01:13:30.339
You're a good egg.

01:13:31.549 --> 01:13:33.801
But I don't like
Baby Face Nelson.

01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:37.554
You got Nelson all wrong, John.
He thinks the world of you.

01:13:38.765 --> 01:13:41.350
Hell, the whole country
thinks you're a goddamn hero.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:44.144
Where's the bank?

01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:45.646
Sioux Falls.

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.482
Nelson says there's
$800,000 in there.

01:13:48.942 --> 01:13:50.901
Says he's got us a sweet
little place to hole up

01:13:50.985 --> 01:13:53.320
till after the heat blows over.

01:13:53.404 --> 01:13:54.780
What's he here for?

01:13:56.407 --> 01:14:00.995
John, we gotta all be friends, all
right, or this ain't gonna work.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.333
Red told you, after the bank,
we bust out Pierpont and Makley.

01:14:05.417 --> 01:14:07.335
It'll take a lot
of careful planning.

01:14:08.003 --> 01:14:09.170
Yeah. So?

01:14:09.255 --> 01:14:12.590
<i>... and Public Enemy Number 1,
John Dillinger.</i>

01:14:15.177 --> 01:14:16.928
<i>They may be sitting amongst you.</i>

01:14:20.101 --> 01:14:21.977
<i>They may be in your row.</i>

01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:32.821
<i>Turn to your right.</i>

01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:37.952
<i>And turn to your left.</i>

01:14:39.454 --> 01:14:43.541
<i>If you see them, call the Bureau of
Investigation or your local police.</i>

01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:58.097
After the bank,

01:14:58.181 --> 01:15:01.392
we'll figure out if we
can bust them out. Okay?

01:15:06.607 --> 01:15:07.773
Okay.

01:15:20.747 --> 01:15:22.998
"You don't work with
people you don't know

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:24.374
"and you don't work
when you're desperate."

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:26.543
Walter Dietrich.
Remember that?

01:15:26.836 --> 01:15:28.337
Walter forgot.

01:15:29.255 --> 01:15:31.924
When you're desperate,
that's when you got no choice.

01:15:48.026 --> 01:15:49.443
I got one!

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:01.456
What are you doing? Get your
hands up! Get your hands up!

01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:09.464
Come on, sugar,
let's go. Come on.

01:16:11.175 --> 01:16:13.176
Where's all the damn money
we came here for?

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.143
Come on.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:24.104
Open the door. What
are you looking at, huh?

01:16:25.731 --> 01:16:27.232
What are you looking at?

01:16:50.924 --> 01:16:52.091
Tommy.

01:17:13.616 --> 01:17:15.075
John, let's go!

01:17:20.665 --> 01:17:23.584
Let's go!
Get in the goddamn car!

01:17:25.253 --> 01:17:27.212
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:37.955 --> 01:18:39.288
How'd you find
this place?

01:18:39.373 --> 01:18:41.916
Don't worry. Nobody
will find us. Come on.

01:18:51.718 --> 01:18:52.969
How much?

01:18:53.554 --> 01:18:55.972
$46, 120.

01:18:58.392 --> 01:19:01.310
That'd be less than
$800,000. Am I right?

01:19:04.022 --> 01:19:05.231
Am I right?

01:19:05.899 --> 01:19:07.275
It's $8,000 a man.

01:19:12.407 --> 01:19:13.991
Leave me my share and get out.

01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:37.766
We gotta cut loose from Nelson.

01:19:37.851 --> 01:19:39.476
You gotta rest up a while.

01:19:40.061 --> 01:19:41.312
No.

01:19:42.606 --> 01:19:45.482
No. If we don't get out of
here first thing in the morning,

01:19:46.277 --> 01:19:47.277
we're gonna wind up dead.

01:19:47.361 --> 01:19:48.945
Only you're gonna make it.

01:19:52.283 --> 01:19:54.743
God damn it, don't talk like that, Red.

01:19:54.827 --> 01:19:57.787
No, Johnny. I got a
feeling that my time is up.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:00.957
And when your time is up,
your time's up.

01:20:05.254 --> 01:20:06.463
Red,

01:20:07.965 --> 01:20:08.965
look here.

01:20:10.301 --> 01:20:15.096
Tomorrow morning, Homer,
you and me will go to Reno,

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:17.515
and everything will be fine.

01:20:37.454 --> 01:20:38.412
Give me a shot.

01:20:38.497 --> 01:20:40.498
I'll give you the shot if you
tell me where the gang's holed up.

01:20:40.582 --> 01:20:42.124
I don't know anything.
Where's Baby Face Nelson?

01:20:42.209 --> 01:20:43.334
I don't know!
Where's Dillinger?

01:20:43.377 --> 01:20:44.462
I wanna know where
they are. I don't know!

01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:45.880
Tell me! Where are they?

01:20:46.674 --> 01:20:48.216
The bullet entered
the back of his head.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.759
It's resting over his right eye.

01:20:49.843 --> 01:20:50.885
Do not interfere.

01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:52.845
Do not interfere. His brain is
swelling! He will be dead soon!

01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:54.847
He's suffering and I
need to sedate him!

01:20:54.932 --> 01:20:56.057
Not yet.

01:20:56.141 --> 01:20:57.976
If you interfere,
I will arrest you.

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.063
I don't know! Please, give
me a shot! Oh, mother, please!

01:21:02.147 --> 01:21:03.941
Tell me where he is!
I don't know!

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:05.109
All right.

01:21:06.903 --> 01:21:07.987
Where?

01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:12.491
Tell me!

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.911
Little Bohemia.

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:17.579
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.540
Fuck you!

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:24.628
Give me a shot.

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:41.770
Little Bohemia is in
Manitowish, Wisconsin.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.648
Sam, you drive up.

01:23:07.278 --> 01:23:12.074
Madala and Clegg, you cut through
the woods. Stay in the trees.

01:23:12.158 --> 01:23:13.492
Come up on it
from the south,

01:23:13.576 --> 01:23:16.578
close enough to see if
they're in the barroom there.

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:18.664
Rice, Rorer,

01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:24.004
come up on it from the
north. The kitchen is there.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.883
You see if they're in what is probably
the dining room. You stay in the trees.

01:23:28.009 --> 01:23:29.927
And if he sees them in there? We go in.

01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:31.345
And if he doesn't?

01:23:34.015 --> 01:23:35.349
We go in anyway.

01:23:37.227 --> 01:23:39.062
There's too much
real estate out here.

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:40.397
Too many ways for him
to get out,

01:23:40.481 --> 01:23:42.774
too few of us to block him in.

01:23:42.859 --> 01:23:44.734
We need to blockade
the roads behind us.

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:47.571
We need to wait for Cowley's
group to surround him.

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.865
Mr. Purvis, this is
not the way to do it.

01:23:53.035 --> 01:23:55.370
I will not risk their
escaping the Bureau again.

01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:59.958
You and Hurt take the northeast
corner where the road turns.

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:04.254
Cover that and the front.
Campbell, Baum, you're with me.

01:24:10.928 --> 01:24:11.970
Thanks, but we gotta go.

01:24:12.054 --> 01:24:13.638
No, come on, stick
around. Let's have a party.

01:24:13.723 --> 01:24:15.765
We gotta work tomorrow.
Aw, work's for mugs.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.058
Get out of here!

01:24:29.406 --> 01:24:30.823
You wanna see
my James Cagney?

01:24:30.908 --> 01:24:33.326
You wanna see my James
Cagney act? Huh? Huh?

01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:35.828
What do you see? What do
you say? What do you know?

01:24:35.913 --> 01:24:39.083
What's your name, doll?
This your wife, you dumb egg?

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.430
Go ahead.

01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:11.158
Stop that car!

01:25:12.244 --> 01:25:13.744
Bureau of Investigation!

01:25:15.789 --> 01:25:16.872
Stop that car!

01:25:19.626 --> 01:25:20.793
Fire!

01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:17.478
Don't shoot!
Get on the floor!

01:26:28.073 --> 01:26:29.198
Johnny!

01:27:19.002 --> 01:27:20.169
Go!

01:28:00.044 --> 01:28:01.461
Someone got out!

01:28:03.172 --> 01:28:04.631
Is it Dillinger?

01:28:04.757 --> 01:28:06.216
I think so!

01:28:07.677 --> 01:28:10.638
Baum, you drive around
the woods. You flank him!

01:29:42.819 --> 01:29:43.860
Go.

01:29:45.696 --> 01:29:46.865
Go!

01:30:00.296 --> 01:30:03.048
Come on, Red, come on. Come
on. We're getting out of here.

01:30:13.644 --> 01:30:16.646
Hey, give me the keys
to that car.

01:30:42.756 --> 01:30:43.756
Have you...

01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:49.597
All you bastards wear vests,

01:30:49.681 --> 01:30:52.766
so I'm gonna give it to you high
and I'm gonna give it to you low.

01:31:08.785 --> 01:31:09.994
Carter?

01:31:15.375 --> 01:31:17.418
Who was it? Dillinger?

01:31:17.502 --> 01:31:19.170
Nelson.

01:31:40.693 --> 01:31:43.028
Sir, there's somebody
on the road.

01:31:44.864 --> 01:31:46.448
Cowley! Did you see a car?

01:31:46.532 --> 01:31:47.950
A Ford, yeah,
it's going the other way.

01:31:48.034 --> 01:31:50.911
Turn it around! Madala,
get in. It's Nelson!

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.097
Get in, you dumb bastards!
Get in!

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.351
Get in. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

01:32:13.894 --> 01:32:15.144
Where'd you get the car?

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:16.437
I killed a Fed by the road.

01:32:21.028 --> 01:32:22.404
Faster, Sam!

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:36.292
They're behind us.
Let them have it, Homer!

01:32:41.508 --> 01:32:43.342
Steady the car, God damn it!

01:32:53.603 --> 01:32:54.729
Shit!

01:33:12.456 --> 01:33:14.290
Homer! Homer!

01:33:29.932 --> 01:33:31.141
Come on!

01:34:13.104 --> 01:34:14.604
Have you never seen
a man die before?

01:34:14.688 --> 01:34:15.855
Hush up.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.026
You gotta let go, John.

01:34:21.278 --> 01:34:22.403
Bullshit.

01:34:26.534 --> 01:34:28.451
And you gotta
let Billie go, too.

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:35.583
I know you.

01:34:37.379 --> 01:34:39.088
You've never let nobody down.

01:34:40.549 --> 01:34:42.007
But this time,

01:34:43.093 --> 01:34:44.510
you gotta go on.

01:34:46.763 --> 01:34:48.180
You gotta let go.

01:35:22.677 --> 01:35:24.094
Right now,

01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:27.681
all of Dillinger's
friends are dead.

01:35:30.768 --> 01:35:32.019
He is out there.

01:35:33.897 --> 01:35:35.272
He is alone.

01:35:37.317 --> 01:35:41.236
And there will not be a
better chance to run him down.

01:35:42.363 --> 01:35:44.031
Yeah, but he could
be anywhere.

01:35:44.115 --> 01:35:45.866
He could be anywhere.

01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:48.952
But he is not anywhere, because
what he wants is right here.

01:36:12.311 --> 01:36:14.397
I don't believe
in the government,

01:36:14.482 --> 01:36:16.733
and I don't believe in the
government spending all its money,

01:36:16.817 --> 01:36:19.653
and hence I don't
take any part of it.

01:36:20.446 --> 01:36:23.114
And you say no, you...

01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:42.760
I ought to refuse to accept the
money. It's government money.

01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:45.388
I don't believe in
the government spending.

01:36:45.597 --> 01:36:47.848
I'm not gonna take it.

01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:52.687
What's she doing?

01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:55.189
Still listening to the radio.

01:37:52.209 --> 01:37:55.003
Sir, we have questioned
a source, John Probasco.

01:37:55.087 --> 01:37:58.256
We have information that leads
us to believe that they're...

01:38:25.368 --> 01:38:27.911
But Dillinger did aid
law enforcement in one way.

01:38:28.872 --> 01:38:32.792
He's cited as the reason Congress is
considering the first national crime bill,

01:38:32.876 --> 01:38:36.462
making criminal enterprise across
state lines a federal offense.

01:38:36.546 --> 01:38:37.713
Meanwhile, in Fargo,
North Dakota...

01:38:37.798 --> 01:38:39.507
We're building
coast-to-coast.

01:38:39.591 --> 01:38:42.093
We want it nice and quiet,
and they bring this on us?

01:38:42.636 --> 01:38:45.638
Frank, calm down. They rob banks. Right.

01:38:45.972 --> 01:38:49.560
In one state, then another
state, that's called interstate.

01:38:49.645 --> 01:38:52.021
We're coast to coast.
Wake up!

01:38:52.106 --> 01:38:53.773
Now they can use these laws on us.

01:39:13.461 --> 01:39:14.878
What time is it?

01:39:16.423 --> 01:39:19.341
It's 4:00 a. m., Sunday morning.
What's wrong?

01:39:20.677 --> 01:39:22.136
I don't want to sleep.

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.345
Why?

01:39:24.889 --> 01:39:26.890
Because I want
all the time we got.

01:39:38.862 --> 01:39:40.195
What if

01:39:41.072 --> 01:39:43.740
we could get out
of here altogether?

01:39:47.037 --> 01:39:48.204
Where?

01:39:50.458 --> 01:39:51.624
Like Cuba?

01:39:52.543 --> 01:39:53.585
Maybe further.

01:39:55.838 --> 01:39:59.591
Alvin's got this job.
It's a big job, a lot of dough.

01:40:02.428 --> 01:40:03.887
We could go away on it.

01:40:04.763 --> 01:40:07.184
We grab a Pan Am
Clipper to Caracas,

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:10.854
scoot on over to Rio
for some fun in the sun,

01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:14.733
slide off the map.

01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:19.946
We could go dancing

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.532
and have a lot of laughs

01:40:24.035 --> 01:40:25.369
any time we want.

01:40:31.293 --> 01:40:33.085
Want to take
that ride with me?

01:40:38.425 --> 01:40:40.718
Yeah, I want to take
that ride with you.

01:41:06.204 --> 01:41:07.579
Where's the apartment?

01:41:07.664 --> 01:41:08.914
Oakley and Potomac.

01:41:08.998 --> 01:41:11.500
All right, the bartender's
name is Larry Strong.

01:41:11.876 --> 01:41:13.377
He'll give you the keys.

01:41:45.913 --> 01:41:48.039
Who brought you?
How did you get here?

01:41:50.001 --> 01:41:52.335
A taxi. I took a taxi.

01:42:16.193 --> 01:42:18.403
Let's go. Let's go, guys.
Come on! Get her outside.

01:43:37.946 --> 01:43:39.114
Where is he?

01:43:40.116 --> 01:43:42.117
Where were you meeting?
Where were you hiding out?

01:43:42.201 --> 01:43:45.453
Answer him or they'll drop
you in a black hole in Cook County.

01:43:52.336 --> 01:43:53.628
Where is he?

01:43:55.005 --> 01:43:56.756
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:44:33.172 --> 01:44:34.964
Christ, look what you did.

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:39.969
Where were you
supposed to meet him?

01:44:44.141 --> 01:44:45.433
I can't hear you.

01:44:46.059 --> 01:44:48.269
I can't hear you!

01:44:59.741 --> 01:45:02.201
We were supposed to
meet at our apartment.

01:45:03.495 --> 01:45:04.661
Where?

01:45:05.538 --> 01:45:06.914
On Addison.

01:45:07.373 --> 01:45:08.624
What number?

01:45:11.002 --> 01:45:12.836
1148.

01:45:12.921 --> 01:45:14.379
When?

01:45:17.719 --> 01:45:18.969
Right now.

01:45:26.228 --> 01:45:28.729
Miss Roberts, can you
reach Agent Purvis?

01:45:28.814 --> 01:45:31.482
No. He's on his way back
from Mooresville, Indiana.

01:45:31.566 --> 01:45:33.442
He's going directly
to Cook County Jail.

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:39.658
John Dillinger's holed up
at 1148 Addison.

01:46:15.612 --> 01:46:16.779
Where is he?

01:46:20.576 --> 01:46:21.617
Well,

01:46:24.538 --> 01:46:27.623
way the hell away from
here by now, isn't he?

01:46:29.376 --> 01:46:32.964
You wanted to know where
he is, you dumb flatfoot.

01:46:35.676 --> 01:46:39.137
Mr. Purvis, those men cannot
treat a woman in this way.

01:46:42.099 --> 01:46:44.809
You walked right past him
on State Street.

01:46:45.853 --> 01:46:48.146
You were too scared
to look around.

01:46:48.856 --> 01:46:51.190
He was at the curb
in that black Buick.

01:46:52.402 --> 01:46:55.070
You asked me how I got there,
I told you I took a taxi,

01:46:55.155 --> 01:46:57.323
and you believed me?

01:46:58.325 --> 01:47:01.243
He dropped me off
and was waiting for me.

01:47:01.828 --> 01:47:04.747
And you walked
right past him.

01:47:13.632 --> 01:47:18.344
And when my Johnny finds out
how you slapped around his girl,

01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:22.932
you know what happens
to you, fat boy?

01:47:31.484 --> 01:47:32.692
Uncuff her.

01:47:46.707 --> 01:47:48.708
Restroom is down the hall.

01:47:55.885 --> 01:47:57.302
I can't stand up.

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:18.324
Miss Rogers.

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:36.175
Hello.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.263
I'm Marty Zarkovich.
I was told to call you, Mr. Nitti.

01:48:41.306 --> 01:48:43.266
<i>I think I can get her to play ball.</i>

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:45.935
Make sure.

01:48:48.982 --> 01:48:50.190
Yes, sir, Mr. Nitti.

01:48:59.826 --> 01:49:01.285
What did they say, Anna?

01:49:04.289 --> 01:49:06.915
They say they send me
back to Romania.

01:49:08.336 --> 01:49:09.628
You know what to do.

01:49:16.636 --> 01:49:19.305
Can they fix deportation?
Can they do that?

01:49:20.807 --> 01:49:22.558
These guys can fix anything.

01:49:32.612 --> 01:49:33.695
Okay.

01:49:59.847 --> 01:50:01.098
I want guarantee.

01:50:03.518 --> 01:50:06.604
If you aid us in
apprehending John Dillinger,

01:50:07.231 --> 01:50:08.773
I give you my word

01:50:09.399 --> 01:50:12.068
I will do everything I can to
influence Bureau of Immigration

01:50:12.152 --> 01:50:13.611
to let you stay in America.

01:50:13.695 --> 01:50:14.821
Not enough.

01:50:16.198 --> 01:50:17.657
Well, that's all there is.

01:50:18.534 --> 01:50:19.992
I want guarantee.

01:50:21.411 --> 01:50:23.204
Well, you're not gonna get one.

01:50:24.875 --> 01:50:26.376
I think you did this.

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:29.879
I think you told Immigration to pick
me up and send me back to Romania.

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:34.050
How do you socialize with him?

01:50:37.972 --> 01:50:39.139
We go out.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.353
Maybe tomorrow night.
Maybe not.

01:50:45.522 --> 01:50:48.732
Maybe in a week, a month.
Maybe never.

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:54.572
I will not guarantee
what Immigration will do,

01:50:54.656 --> 01:50:56.824
but I can guarantee what I will do.

01:50:56.908 --> 01:50:59.285
If you do not cooperate,

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:03.956
you will be on a boat out
of this country in 48 hours.

01:51:04.583 --> 01:51:06.417
Do not play games with me.

01:51:13.758 --> 01:51:14.925
Who is "we"?

01:51:16.261 --> 01:51:19.555
Me, him, Polly Hamilton,
one of my girls.

01:51:21.892 --> 01:51:23.518
How will we know?

01:51:25.104 --> 01:51:27.105
I call you on the day
when I know.

01:51:52.884 --> 01:51:53.884
Did you get in there?
Did you see her?

01:51:53.968 --> 01:51:55.344
Yes, I did.

01:51:56.638 --> 01:51:58.096
She palmed me this note.

01:52:14.114 --> 01:52:15.657
She told me what it said.

01:52:16.742 --> 01:52:17.992
That's good advice.

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.164
What are you doing here?

01:52:26.252 --> 01:52:27.585
Meeting people.

01:52:43.186 --> 01:52:46.272
On Tuesday, it'll carry the payrolls
for seven factories around Rockford.

01:52:46.356 --> 01:52:48.190
There's 2 ways in, 2 ways out.

01:52:48.275 --> 01:52:51.068
Doc cuts the telephone lines
five minutes before.

01:52:51.152 --> 01:52:53.445
Train arrives,
you and I go in strong.

01:52:53.530 --> 01:52:55.281
Harry handles the door
and the safe.

01:52:55.365 --> 01:52:56.865
Jimmy and Freddy drive.

01:52:59.871 --> 01:53:00.955
What do you figure?

01:53:01.039 --> 01:53:04.500
About $1,500,000
to $1,700,000.

01:53:05.168 --> 01:53:07.128
$300,000 each.

01:53:07.212 --> 01:53:08.713
Holy cow.
Yeah.

01:53:10.716 --> 01:53:13.217
We pull this Tuesday,
I'm gone Wednesday.

01:53:13.302 --> 01:53:14.802
Yeah. Where? Cuba?

01:53:15.304 --> 01:53:16.429
No.

01:53:17.347 --> 01:53:20.225
No. Where I go, I'm gonna have
to go a lot farther than Cuba.

01:53:21.769 --> 01:53:23.020
Yeah.

01:53:33.323 --> 01:53:34.323
Hi, Jimmy.

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:35.449
What do you say?

01:53:35.533 --> 01:53:36.992
Polly, Jimmy's back!

01:53:54.135 --> 01:53:55.469
I tell you what, doll.

01:53:56.387 --> 01:53:59.223
How about you, Polly and me
go out to a movie tonight?

01:53:59.308 --> 01:54:00.808
Get in some refrigeration.

01:54:01.477 --> 01:54:02.935
Where do you want to go?

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:05.605
Maybe the Marbro
or the Biograph.

01:54:07.441 --> 01:54:09.317
Jimmy's taking us
to the picture show.

01:54:10.527 --> 01:54:12.904
I'll go to the store later and
make fried chicken for dinner.

01:54:12.988 --> 01:54:14.280
Where you going?

01:54:14.406 --> 01:54:15.656
Streetcar.

01:54:16.116 --> 01:54:18.620
I gotta go downtown to get
my waitressing license.

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:23.583
Hang on a minute. I'll take
you. It's too damn hot in here.

01:54:24.168 --> 01:54:25.168
Yeah?

01:54:41.436 --> 01:54:43.854
Mr. Purvis. Anna Sage.

01:54:46.358 --> 01:54:47.858
Afternoon, Miss Sage.

01:54:55.951 --> 01:54:57.118
It is tonight!

01:54:57.661 --> 01:54:59.453
Anna Sage will be with him

01:54:59.538 --> 01:55:02.706
and will wear a white blouse
over an orange skirt.

01:55:02.791 --> 01:55:04.708
That is how
we will know it is him.

01:55:05.585 --> 01:55:07.545
He may have changed
his appearance.

01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:10.423
And we have not learned if he will
go to the Marbro or the Biograph.

01:55:10.507 --> 01:55:12.508
Two theaters?
That's right.

01:55:12.592 --> 01:55:13.843
What's playing?

01:55:13.927 --> 01:55:15.137
Excuse me?

01:55:15.221 --> 01:55:17.931
What's playing at the Marbro?
What's playing at the Biograph?

01:55:21.352 --> 01:55:25.147
A Shirley Temple movie called
Little Miss Marker is at the Marbro.

01:55:25.231 --> 01:55:27.482
The Biograph is playing
a gangster picture

01:55:27.567 --> 01:55:30.610
starring Clark Gable,
Manhattan Melodrama.

01:55:31.028 --> 01:55:33.864
John Dillinger ain't going
to a Shirley Temple movie.

01:55:34.409 --> 01:55:37.828
Sergeants Zarkovich and O'Neill, from
the East Chicago Police Department,

01:55:37.912 --> 01:55:41.748
and Agent Winstead will be
at the Biograph, as will I.

01:55:41.833 --> 01:55:44.751
Now, Virgil Peterson, you
will coordinate the Marbro.

01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:47.880
He will be armed and
extremely dangerous.

01:55:52.218 --> 01:55:53.469
Is that it?

01:55:53.553 --> 01:55:54.679
Yep.

01:55:54.763 --> 01:55:56.514
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

01:56:01.729 --> 01:56:02.979
I'll go in with you.

01:56:03.898 --> 01:56:05.190
All right.

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:10.403
It might take 10 minutes.

01:56:11.405 --> 01:56:12.739
I'll meet you outside.

01:58:11.699 --> 01:58:15.118
I'd like to see Babe take
one more swing this season.

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:22.042
But his leg is pretty sore. He takes a
bit of batting practice, but not very much.

01:58:26.839 --> 01:58:28.048
What's the score?

01:58:29.217 --> 01:58:31.093
Cubs, 3-2, top of the 7th.

01:58:31.553 --> 01:58:33.596
<i>... that's why he's
out of today's game.</i>

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.140
<i>The pitch is high. Ball one.</i>

01:58:36.642 --> 01:58:40.895
<i>Broaca, the batter
leading off for the Yankees,</i>

01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:43.439
<i>did not see the ball very well.</i>

01:58:45.609 --> 01:58:46.901
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:58:50.405 --> 01:58:51.697
Nothing yet.

01:58:59.081 --> 01:59:01.290
They haven't shown up
at the Marbro.

02:00:36.141 --> 02:00:37.433
Blackie!
Jim!

02:00:37.517 --> 02:00:38.684
<i>Well, you old son of a gun!</i>

02:00:38.769 --> 02:00:40.603
<i>I say, you're looking swell, Jim.</i>

02:00:40.687 --> 02:00:42.271
<i>Let's get a load of this
Dempsey-Firpo binge, shall we?</i>

02:00:42.355 --> 02:00:44.817
<i>Yeah, yeah. But when will we get
together again? Gee, it's been weeks!</i>

02:00:44.902 --> 02:00:46.444
<i>Well, what about
tomorrow night? Saturday?</i>

02:00:46.945 --> 02:00:50.072
I will light my cigar
when he's coming out.

02:00:50.741 --> 02:00:54.076
Zarkovich, O'Neill,
you and your men

02:00:54.161 --> 02:00:56.704
take the hat store right
across from the theater.

02:00:57.372 --> 02:01:01.709
Smith, Suran, Clegg, take two
agents, you cover the rear alley.

02:01:02.377 --> 02:01:06.340
And Rorer and Rice, you stay in
the car with Reinecke to the north.

02:01:06.424 --> 02:01:08.300
Clarence and I are
gonna be in the doorway

02:01:08.384 --> 02:01:10.803
30 feet south of
the theater entrance.

02:01:10.887 --> 02:01:14.473
Gerry, you're in the tan sedan
just to the north of the entrance.

02:01:14.557 --> 02:01:16.016
In case he walks north?

02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:18.060
He ain't gonna walk
north, Mr. Purvis.

02:01:18.144 --> 02:01:21.605
He's gonna head south, cut through
the alley back to her place.

02:01:23.608 --> 02:01:25.150
Madala.

02:01:34.869 --> 02:01:36.036
<i>Hello, Gallagher.</i>

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.496
<i>Hello, Snow.</i>

02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:38.705
<i>Must be something pretty important,</i>

02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:40.624
<i>getting me in here in
the middle of the game.</i>

02:01:40.708 --> 02:01:41.834
<i>What do you want?</i>

02:01:41.918 --> 02:01:44.087
<i>I want to do a little
favor for a friend.</i>

02:02:03.943 --> 02:02:07.404
<i>You're the governor.
You can save his life.</i>

02:02:09.323 --> 02:02:11.867
<i>He's guilty.
The jury says so.</i>

02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:34.473
<i>Goodbye, Blackie.</i>

02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:02.753
<i>Goodbye, Jim.</i>

02:03:02.837 --> 02:03:04.254
<i>I can't help it, Blackie.</i>

02:03:04.339 --> 02:03:05.964
<i>I'm not gonna let you die.</i>

02:03:06.591 --> 02:03:07.841
<i>I've got to commute you.</i>

02:03:08.426 --> 02:03:09.885
<i>You think you're doing me a favor</i>

02:03:09.969 --> 02:03:12.679
<i>by keeping me locked up in this
filthy trap for the rest of my life?</i>

02:03:12.764 --> 02:03:16.308
<i>No, thanks. Come on,
warden, let's go.</i>

02:03:41.879 --> 02:03:43.254
<i>So long, Blackie.</i>

02:03:44.006 --> 02:03:46.716
<i>Kid, keep your chin
up and your nose clean.</i>

02:03:50.721 --> 02:03:53.139
<i>Die the way you lived, all of
a sudden, that's the way to go.</i>

02:03:53.224 --> 02:03:54.975
<i>Don't drag it out.</i>

02:03:55.059 --> 02:03:57.185
<i>Living like that
doesn't mean a thing.</i>

02:07:14.269 --> 02:07:15.603
What did he say?

02:07:18.315 --> 02:07:19.773
I couldn't hear him.

02:07:31.787 --> 02:07:34.956
You take care of this. I
need to go call Washington.

02:09:05.093 --> 02:09:06.635
How you doing, Billie?

02:09:11.016 --> 02:09:12.850
I'm Special Agent Winstead.

02:09:17.314 --> 02:09:19.732
If you've come here to ask
me more damn questions...

02:09:20.525 --> 02:09:22.818
"Where's this one
or that one?"

02:09:22.902 --> 02:09:25.321
I didn't come here for
you to tell me something.

02:09:26.323 --> 02:09:28.366
I came here to
tell you something.

02:09:38.961 --> 02:09:41.004
They say you're the man who shot him.

02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:46.803
That's right. One of them.

02:09:48.306 --> 02:09:50.265
So why are you
coming here to see me?

02:09:52.393 --> 02:09:54.394
To see the damage
you've done?

02:09:57.482 --> 02:09:58.565
No.

02:10:01.444 --> 02:10:03.403
I came here because
he asked me to.

02:10:08.327 --> 02:10:10.203
When he went down,
he said something.

02:10:12.122 --> 02:10:13.956
I put my ear next to his mouth,

02:10:15.125 --> 02:10:17.043
and what I think he said was this.

02:10:19.046 --> 02:10:20.296
He said,

02:10:21.090 --> 02:10:22.965
"Tell Billie for me,

02:10:24.426 --> 02:10:26.135
"'Bye-bye, blackbird."'
