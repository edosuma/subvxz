<i>left our Jane,</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:06.340
<i>yup, having a fling</i>

<i>But you know what wasn't tiny?</i>

00:19.311 --> 00:20.938
<i>Rogelio's happiness.</i>

00:20.938 --> 00:24.232
<i>Because he finally got engaged</i>

00:20.938 --> 00:24.232
<i>to Xiomara, again!</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:25.818
<i>And they had decided</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:25.818
<i>on a wedding</i>

00:25.818 --> 00:28.278
<i>to match their love.</i>

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:28.278 --> 00:30.197
<i>And speaking of big love,</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:32.282
<i>Rafael was feeling it</i>

00:30.197 --> 00:32.282
<i>for Petra,</i>

00:32.282 --> 00:34.535
<i>and so he told her.</i>

00:32.282 --> 00:34.535
I want to be with you.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.997
<i>But Petra, well,</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:37.997
<i>she just wasn't sure.</i>

00:37.997 --> 00:40.582
<i>I know, buzz-kill, right?</i>

00:37.997 --> 00:40.582
( knock at door )

00:40.582 --> 00:42.835
<i>And then they were interrupted</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:42.835
<i>by the cops,</i>

00:42.835 --> 00:44.962
<i>who said they knew</i>

00:42.835 --> 00:44.962
<i>who killed Scott, and it was...</i>

00:44.962 --> 00:46.463
( needle scratches on record )

00:46.463 --> 00:48.298
<i>Actually, you'll</i>

00:46.463 --> 00:48.298
<i>find that out soon enough.</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.049
<i>One last bit</i>

00:48.298 --> 00:50.049
<i>of back story on Rafael.</i>

00:50.049 --> 00:51.886
<i>Sure, he's rich,</i>

00:50.049 --> 00:51.886
<i>but things haven't always</i>

00:51.886 --> 00:53.428
<i>been easy for him.</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:56.390
<i>A long time ago,</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:56.390
<i>he had cancer.</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.099
<i>And remember his sister Luisa?</i>

00:58.099 --> 00:59.685
<i>Well, she was dating Rose,</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:02.479
<i>aka the crime lord</i>

00:59.685 --> 01:02.479
<i>Sin Rostro.</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:05.315
<i>Though in public, Rose wore</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:05.315
<i>a mask, and looked like this.</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:07.902
<i>I know! Straight out</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:07.902
<i>of a telenovela, right?</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:10.571
<i>Which, of course,</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:10.571
<i>this is, after all.</i>

01:11.906 --> 01:14.700
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:11.906 --> 01:14.700
<i>there was a little girl</i>

01:14.700 --> 01:17.828
<i>who believed</i>

01:14.700 --> 01:17.828
<i>in once upon a time.</i>

01:17.828 --> 01:21.874
"And the glass slipper fit

01:17.828 --> 01:21.874
Cinderella's foot perfectly."

01:21.874 --> 01:23.542
<i>That's right.</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:26.336
<i>From a young age,</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:26.336
<i>Jane Gloriana Villanueva</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:28.087
<i>believed in the magic</i>

01:28.087 --> 01:29.548
<i>of fairy tales.</i>

01:29.548 --> 01:33.343
"And so they got

01:29.548 --> 01:33.343
married and lived..."

01:33.343 --> 01:35.930
Happily ever after.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.472
The end.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.182
<i>But as time went on,</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:43.020
<i>Jane exchanged that for</i>

01:39.182 --> 01:43.020
<i>a more...realistic perspective.</i>

01:43.020 --> 01:46.065
"And so they got

01:43.020 --> 01:46.065
married and lived..."

01:46.065 --> 01:48.859
uh, together

01:46.065 --> 01:48.859
as husband and wife.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.737
Uh, and they had

01:48.859 --> 01:51.737
their ups and downs,

01:51.737 --> 01:53.822
and they faced

01:51.737 --> 01:53.822
difficult times

01:53.822 --> 01:55.490
where their relationship

01:53.822 --> 01:55.490
was tested,

01:55.490 --> 01:56.867
but they stuck through it,

01:56.867 --> 01:58.660
because they knew that

01:56.867 --> 01:58.660
relationships take work

01:58.660 --> 02:02.372
and, you know, life doesn't

01:58.660 --> 02:02.372
always work out perfectly.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.958
The end.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.085
Oh, and the princess

02:06.085 --> 02:09.337
had her own fulfilling career

02:06.085 --> 02:09.337
outside the monarchy.

02:09.337 --> 02:12.591
The<i> Cinderella</i> we're doing at

02:09.337 --> 02:12.591
school has a different ending.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.760
We-- Well, there can be

02:12.591 --> 02:14.760
lots of different endings,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.678
that's what makes

02:14.760 --> 02:16.678
the story so great.

02:16.678 --> 02:21.141
<i>So, yeah. By now, Jane was over</i>

02:16.678 --> 02:21.141
<i>the whole fairy tale thing.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:22.476
Okay, I'm ready.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.769
Hit me with the wedding deets.

02:23.769 --> 02:28.398
The theme is a fairy tale

02:23.769 --> 02:28.398
come to life.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.110
<i>Yeah, apparently Rogelio</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:31.110
<i>didn't get the memo.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:35.114
Oh, wow, look at that.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.198
Doves, sure.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.951
And fireworks.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.329
A carriage pulled

02:42.329 --> 02:43.497
by white horses.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.915
And this is what you want?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.500
Because it's your day, too.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.377
The white horses happened

02:46.500 --> 02:49.377
to be your mother's idea.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.088
I always thought I was

02:51.088 --> 02:52.714
too old,

02:51.088 --> 02:52.714
that I missed out

02:52.714 --> 02:54.675
on the whole

02:52.714 --> 02:54.675
princess window,

02:54.675 --> 02:55.926
but your dad

02:55.926 --> 02:57.761
convinced me

02:55.926 --> 02:57.761
it's not too late,

02:57.761 --> 03:01.348
and I started to think

02:57.761 --> 03:01.348
about how fun it would be

03:01.348 --> 03:04.225
to wear the whole,

03:01.348 --> 03:04.225
big poofy dress,

03:04.225 --> 03:05.936
and...

03:05.936 --> 03:07.354
Unless you think

03:05.936 --> 03:07.354
I'll look silly.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.772
I-I don't want

03:07.354 --> 03:08.772
to look silly.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.107
I don't think

03:08.772 --> 03:10.107
you'll look silly.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.441
I think

03:10.107 --> 03:11.441
you'll look beautiful.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.318
Okay...

03:13.318 --> 03:14.569
So I'd like to ask you,

03:14.569 --> 03:15.696
officially,

03:15.696 --> 03:17.156
will you be

03:15.696 --> 03:17.156
my maid of honor?

03:17.156 --> 03:19.825
Yes! Of course! I would

03:17.156 --> 03:19.825
officially love to.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.452
And I am ready to take care

03:19.825 --> 03:22.452
of your every bridal need.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.203
Oh, wow.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.205
That's a-- You're-- Are you--

03:24.203 --> 03:26.205
You're wearing a tiara?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.000
No, this is for you.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.417
I'm wearing a crown.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.601
Wow.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.145
And all this is

03:46.601 --> 03:48.145
happening in two weeks.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.105
Has to. We are all slaves

03:50.105 --> 03:51.815
to the television schedule.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.526

03:57.362 --> 03:59.614
But we already hired,

uh, Jean Luc,

03:59.614 --> 04:01.742
the best

03:59.614 --> 04:01.742
wedding planner around.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.160
He has secured vendors,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.495
fireworks, Malaysian doves...

04:05.495 --> 04:07.039
( in Spanish )

04:05.495 --> 04:07.039
And pardon me for asking...

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

04:07.039 --> 04:08.540
<i>Here we go...</i>

04:08.540 --> 04:10.584
But what role will God play

04:10.584 --> 04:12.669
in this extravaganza?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.171
( in English )

04:12.669 --> 04:14.171
Well...

04:14.171 --> 04:17.216
He created me,

04:14.171 --> 04:17.216
so a very big role.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.844
Who is officiating?

04:20.844 --> 04:23.097
Ah. Ideally,

Ricky Martin.

XIOMARA:

Mom...

04:24.389 --> 04:27.475
A wedding is

04:24.389 --> 04:27.475
a holy sacrament.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.686
We're not getting married

04:27.475 --> 04:29.686
in a church by a priest.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.438
There's got

04:29.686 --> 04:31.438
to be something

In my official capacity

04:35.400 --> 04:37.652

<i>But then...</i>

So I should really go.

No.

Just five more minutes.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.593
Uh... You said that

05:41.049 --> 05:43.593
already. Heh.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.970
I know.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.014
But time goes too fast with you.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.309
Two more minutes?

05:50.309 --> 05:51.559
Boop.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.316
Fabian obviously still wants

05:54.855 --> 05:57.316
some kind of relationship.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.984
So are you gonna

05:57.316 --> 05:58.984
end it with him?

Yeah. I have to.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.611
( phone chimes )

06:03.030 --> 06:04.531
Oh, but a part of me

06:03.030 --> 06:04.531
is just hoping

06:04.531 --> 06:06.741
that he'll take

06:04.531 --> 06:06.741
a hint and fade away.

gonna take the hint.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.000
( sighs )

06:12.580 --> 06:15.000
I know. I have to tell him.

Yeah, well,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.584
do it soon.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.878
It's a little selfish

06:16.584 --> 06:17.878
to not let someone know

06:17.878 --> 06:20.088
where you're at,

06:17.878 --> 06:20.088
emotionally.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.381
Petra still hasn't

06:20.088 --> 06:22.381

No. She says she's

12:13.233 --> 12:15.193
Well, how soon?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.193
Uh, I can't...

12:15.193 --> 12:16.735
<i>I can't plan a meeting</i>

12:16.735 --> 12:18.655

12:16.735 --> 12:18.655

12:18.655 --> 12:20.615
<i>No. Uh, wait.</i>

12:18.655 --> 12:20.615
I have to.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.325
The camels are here,

12:20.615 --> 12:22.325

12:22.325 --> 12:23.742
Wait. No, uh, just...

12:22.325 --> 12:23.742
I just want to know--

12:23.742 --> 12:25.453
Why'd you leave?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.453
It was so sudden.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.039
<i>Did I-did I do something?</i>

12:25.453 --> 12:28.039
Of course not.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.709
We'll catch up

12:29.123 --> 12:30.709
later, okay?

12:32.001 --> 12:33.336
Sorry.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.838

12:33.336 --> 12:35.838
But it's-- It's hard.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173

12:35.838 --> 12:37.173

12:37.173 --> 12:38.508
a better relationship with him.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.051
And you know

12:38.508 --> 12:40.051

12:40.051 --> 12:41.636
he's not working with the cops.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.137
He's not.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.473
Trust me, I know my brother.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.683
Were you able to trace it?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.184
No.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.894
Hopefully she comes

12:48.184 --> 12:49.894
back to town soon.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.189
We can't go back anytime soon.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.108
Come on...

12:55.108 --> 12:57.193
We can go anywhere else

12:57.193 --> 12:59.320
in the world. Hm?

13:00.905 --> 13:04.033
I'll even put on

13:00.905 --> 13:04.033
that uncomfortable mask.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.660
JANE:

13:04.033 --> 13:05.660
<i>I booked your makeup and hair</i>

13:05.660 --> 13:07.870

13:05.660 --> 13:07.870

13:07.870 --> 13:09.289
as long as Dad

13:07.870 --> 13:09.289
moves off that whole thing

13:09.289 --> 13:11.249

13:09.289 --> 13:11.249

13:11.249 --> 13:13.000
Brr...

13:11.249 --> 13:13.000
Oh, and one thing:

13:13.000 --> 13:15.044
The horses.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.044
For the carriage.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.004
It's short notice and it turns

13:15.044 --> 13:17.004
out white horses are really

13:17.004 --> 13:19.466
hard to come by.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.466
I found a speckled horse

13:19.466 --> 13:20.883

You're disappointed?

13:24.178 --> 13:27.223
but I-I've always

13:24.178 --> 13:27.223
pictured white horses.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.351
It's absolutely not dumb!

13:30.351 --> 13:31.728
I will find you white horses.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.896
Thank you!

13:31.728 --> 13:33.896
White will just pop more,

Petra, look...

And I don't care if you don't

13:49.496 --> 13:51.205

13:49.496 --> 13:51.205
I need to talk

13:51.205 --> 13:53.458

13:51.205 --> 13:53.458

13:54.626 --> 13:56.586
So I don't know what to do.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.586

to get over him, Jane.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.281
I know.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.616
And now he wants

14:25.281 --> 14:26.616
to open all that up again?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.242
How is that fair?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.242
Plus,

14:28.242 --> 14:30.704
we were terrible together.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.704
Is he forgetting that?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.061

15:35.268 --> 15:37.061

Ohhh! Ooh.

Okay, well,

No.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.281
So Jane told you she was

18:32.737 --> 18:35.281
going to break up with me?

18:35.281 --> 18:37.241
Of course, we're very close.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.119
Plus, I am great

18:37.241 --> 18:40.119
at keeping secrets.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.122
Okay, so in this next shot,

18:40.119 --> 18:43.122
Rogelio climbs the vine

18:43.122 --> 18:45.249
to get to the top of the table.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.249
Then we push in

18:45.249 --> 18:47.376

18:45.249 --> 18:47.376

But listen,

19:14.695 --> 19:18.198
now that I've processed,

19:18.198 --> 19:20.326
I've decided.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.454
I don't want us to go there.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.706
What?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
We tried.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.709
It didn't work.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.926
I'm saying that

19:36.926 --> 19:38.886
With us, with the kids.

She said

20:35.943 --> 20:37.403
she talked to a friend.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.696
It was clearly you.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.280
What happened to

20:38.696 --> 20:40.280
staying out of it?

20:40.280 --> 20:42.700
She just showed up at

20:40.280 --> 20:42.700

20:42.700 --> 20:45.078
So you sabotaged me?

20:42.700 --> 20:45.078
I didn't sabotage anything.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.580
I hardly talked. I just

20:45.078 --> 20:47.580
sat there listening

20:47.580 --> 20:49.665
to all the reasons why she

20:47.580 --> 20:49.665
thought it wasn't a good idea.

20:49.665 --> 20:50.958
You were supposed

20:49.665 --> 20:50.958
to tell her all the reasons

20:50.958 --> 20:52.085
why you thought that it was.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.836
But I don't think it is.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.507
Well, that's your opinion.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.761
Exactly. And you were the one

20:58.507 --> 21:01.761
who asked me to get involved.

Got it.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.409

You and I both know

22:07.409 --> 22:08.828
you never get shiny

that way!

25:21.479 --> 25:22.980
You should have never

25:21.479 --> 25:22.980
brought your daughter

25:22.980 --> 25:24.148
to the set in the first place!

25:24.148 --> 25:25.649

FABIAN: I will not calm down!

25:41.707 --> 25:43.834
We will fight.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.627

You're being ridiculous!

26:28.504 --> 26:30.005
Listen to me.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.300
I'm sorry about the way

26:30.005 --> 26:33.300
that I handled things.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.843
I know I hurt you.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.179

26:37.179 --> 26:38.264

26:38.264 --> 26:40.349
That is not true.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.477
I've only slept with one

26:40.349 --> 26:43.477

26:43.477 --> 26:45.104

that I slept with

26:45.104 --> 26:46.397

26:46.397 --> 26:48.857
And trust me, that

26:46.397 --> 26:48.857
