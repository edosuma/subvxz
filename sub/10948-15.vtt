16:37.370 --> 16:38.500
Hey.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.080
Well, look at you.

16:40.420 --> 16:41.790
You look so cute.

16:42.250 --> 16:45.210
It took my uncle
ten minutes to do my hair.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.680
So, how do you
like the city so far?

16:52.760 --> 16:53.970
It's okay.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.970
What do you like to do for fun?

16:56.060 --> 16:57.350
Nothing.

16:57.430 --> 17:00.400
Excuse me, sir, would you
and your girlfriend care for dessert?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.270
( SCREAMING ) She is not my girlfriend!

17:08.200 --> 17:12.200
You have...
Quite an appetite for a girl.

17:12.570 --> 17:14.370
Um, thanks?

17:15.830 --> 17:20.290
So, Lee, where were you and your uncle
living before you came here?

17:20.420 --> 17:25.250
( HESITATING ) Um, well, we've been
traveling around for a long time.

17:25.340 --> 17:27.920
Oh! Why were you traveling so much?

17:28.010 --> 17:31.470
We were, uh, part of this
traveling circus.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.720
Really?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.890
What did you do?
Wait, let me guess.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.770
You juggled.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.600
Yes, I juggled.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.650
I've always wanted to
learn how to juggle.

17:41.730 --> 17:43.060
Can you show me something?

17:46.150 --> 17:47.440
Uh...

17:49.780 --> 17:51.110
Whoa, uh!

17:51.660 --> 17:53.450
I haven't practiced for a while.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.950
JIN: It's all right.

17:55.780 --> 17:59.370
Hey, I want to show you
one of my favorite places in the city.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.380
JIN: I'm so excited for you
to see the firelight fountain.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.090
The lamps make the water sparkle,

18:05.170 --> 18:08.130
and reflect in the pool
in the most beautiful way.

18:10.510 --> 18:11.720
I can't believe it!

18:11.800 --> 18:13.010
JIN: They aren't lit.

18:16.890 --> 18:17.890
Close your eyes.

18:17.970 --> 18:18.970
And don't peek.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.290
ZUKO: Okay, Now you can look.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.580
Oh, wow...

18:45.210 --> 18:46.290
What happened?

18:46.380 --> 18:47.630
How did they light?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.050
What did you...

18:59.930 --> 19:01.430
I brought you something.

19:01.770 --> 19:03.980
ZUKO: It's a coupon
for a free cup of tea.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.940
Lee, this is so sweet.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.730
Don't thank me,
it was my uncle's idea.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.900
He thinks you're our
most valuable customer.

19:11.990 --> 19:13.610
Your uncle is a good teacher.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.490
I have something for you, too.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.990
Now it's your turn
to close your eyes.

19:27.790 --> 19:28.840
JIN: What's wrong?

19:29.340 --> 19:30.500
It's complicated.

19:30.590 --> 19:31.590
I have to go.

19:43.730 --> 19:45.560
How was your night, Prince Zuko?

19:50.650 --> 19:51.650
It was nice.
