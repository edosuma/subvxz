01:26.119 --> 01:27.780
What are you doing here?

01:27.887 --> 01:30.822
Georgianna went a half hour ago.
You're gonna miss it.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.619
Put that on my tab.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.825
Your bill.

01:34.961 --> 01:37.862
"Tab" sounds like
y'all might pay it someday.

03:26.739 --> 03:29.640
Time was never a friend to Bobby Long.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.303
It would conspire against him...

03:32.378 --> 03:36.781
allow him to believe in a generous nature,
then rob him blind every time.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.452
We had lost Lorraine, all of us...

03:44.724 --> 03:46.749
but long before she died.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.601
You can't park here.
You'll get another ticket.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.303
I don't see no signs, Miss Daisy.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.686
It's all right.
I can walk to the curb from here.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.190
Get me a beer.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.917
You find a job?

04:46.419 --> 04:48.250
You clean the fuck up?

04:48.655 --> 04:50.953
That Bobby guy called again today.

04:53.192 --> 04:56.025
- Again?
- He called a couple of days ago, remember?

04:56.262 --> 04:58.730
No, you didn't tell me. What did he want?

04:59.399 --> 05:02.732
He wanted to tell you about Lorraine.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.026
What about her?

05:07.907 --> 05:09.238
She died.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.406
She what?

05:12.011 --> 05:15.378
She's dead, all right? He called
because he thought you'd wanna know.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.042
Lorraine died and you didn't tell me?

05:20.019 --> 05:23.045
To Lorraine. May she finally find peace.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.587
So, now what?
Lorraine finally kick y'all out?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.358
No.

05:35.668 --> 05:40.105
She never would.
Besides, God wouldn't let that happen.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.139
Really? And why not?

05:45.244 --> 05:47.769
'Cause God knows me, and I know God.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.839
Go.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.875
Cecil's pretty torn up. Make sure he eats.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.554
I'll see you later.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.417
She never meant nothing to you...

06:02.495 --> 06:06.363
and you didn't mean a damn thing to her.
I didn't think you would care.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.130
Come on, baby, stop.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.367
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

06:14.974 --> 06:18.671
Why don't you just cook me some dinner
and I'll go rent us a porno?

06:18.745 --> 06:20.679
I have to go to a funeral, Lee...

06:20.747 --> 06:24.046
unless I missed it
because you forgot to tell me...

06:24.117 --> 06:28.554
that my mother is dead!
Fucking asshole. I am so out of here.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.384
She was never your mother!

06:36.496 --> 06:39.556
Purslane? This is Bobby Long again.

06:39.832 --> 06:42.062
I don't know if you remember me...

06:45.938 --> 06:48.099
but you missed your mama's funeral.

06:49.675 --> 06:50.869
So long.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.678
You got any smokes?

06:54.514 --> 06:55.640
Sorry, sir.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.980
- Y'all going down to Cecil's?
- In a minute.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.682
- I'll see you guys.
- See you there.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.923
You got a light?

07:07.994 --> 07:10.485
- I thought you didn't have any.
- I don't.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.027
Not for Junior.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.895
He's got to cut down.
He's got fierce emphysema.

07:18.638 --> 07:22.096
That cough sends shivers of mortality
down my spine.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.974
"He'd make a lovely corpse,"
but I'll make no contribution.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.648
Of course not. "Contribute only
to one's own death." That's my motto.

07:29.715 --> 07:31.876
Did you get the girl? She know anything?

07:31.951 --> 07:35.352
- "He'd make a lovely corpse."
- Come on, man. Charles Dickens.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.315
Are you serious? It's Martin Chuzzlewit.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.986
Smart-ass.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.131
New Orleans is a siren of a city.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.999
A place of fables and illusion.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.495
A place Lorraine had to escape from...

07:53.573 --> 07:56.064
and Bobby and I had to escape to.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.970
Away from Alabama...

07:58.244 --> 08:01.236
away from lives
that no longer belonged to us.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.578
I thought she was getting better
that last time, I really did.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.550
When was that?

08:11.057 --> 08:14.220
- A few years ago, at least.
- It'll be six years, October.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.727
Was it that long since we seen her?

08:16.796 --> 08:18.263
Since you seen her.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.228
We should have gone
to the hospital with you.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.862
You should have done a lot of things.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.543
Coming.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.816
This Lorraine's house?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.521
And who are you?

09:59.632 --> 10:01.657
No one. I just live here.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.066
Come on in.

10:17.817 --> 10:18.943
Nice place.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.484
Thanks. We try.

10:27.093 --> 10:30.756
- You're not old enough to be Bobby.
- That's because I'm Lawson.

10:33.666 --> 10:34.655
Okay.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.338
I'm sorry about your mother.
You look a lot like her.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.239
Sorry to wake you so early. It's barely noon.

10:50.883 --> 10:54.375
Bobby. We got company, man. Wake up!

10:56.689 --> 10:59.157
Honey, put your bags down. We don't bite.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.058
- Juice?
- No.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.531
- Bobby, get up. She's here.
- Who?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.226
- Pursey.
- Who?

11:08.434 --> 11:10.368
The girl is here. Get up.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.404
So, when's the funeral?

11:19.612 --> 11:22.479
It was yesterday. It was real nice.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.148
You should have been there, young lady.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.708
That's your opinion.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.819
You must be here for some reason.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.589
I guess you already know
the deal on the house.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.221
What deal?

11:38.464 --> 11:41.024
- The house. Your mother owned it...
- The deal!

11:41.934 --> 11:43.697
Let me tell you what the deal is.

11:43.769 --> 11:47.136
The deal is that
Lorraine left the three of us the house.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.573
Lawson and I are two-thirds,
and you are only one-third.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.705
She did what?

11:53.813 --> 11:56.611
Lawson and I have been living here
for some time.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.082
Your mother hasn't lived here for years.

11:59.819 --> 12:03.118
And I don't believe
that she thought you'd be interested.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.521
Lorraine was great at being wrong.

12:06.726 --> 12:11.186
Purslane, honey, we are here to stay.
This is our home.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.292
It's no big deal...

12:13.365 --> 12:17.893
Lorraine thinking I'd share this shithole
with two alcoholic strangers.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.472
You are alcoholics, aren't you?

12:21.540 --> 12:24.031
But we are not strangers.
We were her friends.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.737
We took care of her.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.075
And this shithole is just fine for us.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.683
It's not suited for a girl like you.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.554
I'm getting up out of bed now.
You can watch if you want.

12:38.624 --> 12:40.489
It don't matter to me.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.262
It seems hard to believe...

12:44.997 --> 12:47.659
that you haven't seen a man naked before.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.631
Not an old one.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.300
I know that you're no innocent...

12:57.309 --> 13:00.437
because I spoke to that boyfriend of yours...

13:00.513 --> 13:03.209
over on the Redneck Riviera.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.716
You certainly didn't choose him
for his brains.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.810
You don't know nothing about me.

13:09.889 --> 13:13.825
I guess that will change
if we all became roommates, wouldn't it?

13:18.731 --> 13:21.222
I'll see you later. I'm out of cigarettes.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.230
My brand is on sale.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.004
Good to see you again, Purslane.

13:29.408 --> 13:30.670
All growed up.

13:43.455 --> 13:47.892
He's not usually such a jackass.
He's just upset about Lorraine. We all are.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.993
He's right, you know. I can't stay here.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.032
It's pretty funny, actually.
My grandma was always talking about...

13:56.101 --> 13:59.537
the pretty little house
Lorraine was fixing up for me...

14:01.941 --> 14:04.967
and I guess
that was the Ernest & Julio talking.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.409
It's fine.

14:06.879 --> 14:10.713
- There's no real surprises here.
- The hospital sent her stuff.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.884
Lorraine would want you to have these.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.482
They went everywhere she did.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.751
She loved those books.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.592
I guess I could unload them
at a flea market or something.

14:33.272 --> 14:37.106
- Here, I'll help you out.
- No, I'm fine.

14:42.715 --> 14:47.049
I really did want to come to the funeral.
I just never got his message.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.090
That girl looks so much like Lorraine.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.863
I remember the first time
you took me to see her sing.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.133
It was my first time in New Orleans.

15:10.943 --> 15:12.774
I was so taken.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.986
You were kind of sheltered.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.280
Choked by that silver spoon.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.482
I thought she was so beautiful.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.756
She was.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.593
What else can I get you boys?

16:43.669 --> 16:47.901
Did anyone ever tell you that you smell
like a Parisian woman in springtime?

16:47.973 --> 16:50.271
Every day, at least once. Y'all gonna eat?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.207
The lawyer could get to her at any time.

16:52.277 --> 16:55.269
So what?
The will says we can stay for a year.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.476
Should I just come back?

16:57.583 --> 17:01.679
Do you know how lethal the smell
of a Parisian woman in springtime is?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.483
Not nearly as lethal as
a Louisiana woman who don't give a shit.

17:06.458 --> 17:11.292
- Eggs and bacon, ma'am. Both of us.
- Cheese on our grits, darling. Please.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.325
You are fucking shameless.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.596
Why didn't you use the bed, sweetheart?

17:45.664 --> 17:49.293
- Oh, God.
- I could have come in and cuddled with you.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.728
That would have been fine with me.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.965
- We could have spooned together.
- Save it.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.909
Why'd you give her this?

18:05.017 --> 18:07.281
This is stories of misfits...

18:09.655 --> 18:12.385
invisible people. It's beautiful.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.984
Have you ever read it?

18:16.628 --> 18:18.459
Have you ever read any book?

18:19.631 --> 18:21.826
Lorraine didn't know she was a poet.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.232
I really do enjoy...

18:27.005 --> 18:28.768
fostering inspiration.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.701
Lawson's a writer. A fine one, too.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.972
Really?

18:34.980 --> 18:37.141
He's writing a book about me.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.174
That's fascinating.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.851
"Chapter 1:
I got up, I got drunk, I passed out.

18:43.622 --> 18:47.183
- "Chapter 2: I got up, I got drunk..."
- Lovely and witty.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.685
You're an embarrassment of riches,
little girl.

18:56.435 --> 18:57.902
Which room is mine?

18:58.971 --> 19:02.634
I'll need a place to stay,
and y'all said I had a right.

19:02.808 --> 19:06.471
Just figured I'd stay here
until you get fed up and leave.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.979
We are never leaving. Never!

19:09.047 --> 19:12.847
- And don't even get it in your mind.
- She should have Lorraine's room.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.011
- I'll stay out here. I'll bunk with you.
- Okay, fine.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.782
Are you fucking crazy?

19:18.857 --> 19:21.792
Better than her poking around
and finding out the truth.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.795
She won't last.
You're gonna make sure of that.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.932
Besides, you're always complaining
how your bed is so cold.

19:31.136 --> 19:33.070
You're too skinny for me.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.609
- So, y'all are really into books?
- They're mostly Bobby's.

19:41.246 --> 19:44.340
- That's the plumage of an English professor.
- Him?

19:44.616 --> 19:46.880
- A professor?
- Yeah, he was a good one.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.379
And you, you're really a writer?

19:49.521 --> 19:51.250
Bobby likes to think I am.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.387
These boxes are all Lorraine's, so...

19:55.093 --> 19:56.458
So what?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.899
- I knew your mother pretty well.
- How well?

20:06.838 --> 20:10.865
She was hard to understand,
but she kept the door to her heart open.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.937
The way I heard it,
it was more of a revolving door, wasn't it?

21:48.407 --> 21:50.204
Purslane Hominy Will.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.706
How come you know my name?

21:55.347 --> 21:56.974
I know a lot about you.

21:57.716 --> 22:01.152
Your mama and I were close
since we were young.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.419
I helped name you.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.685
Your mama thought you were golden...

22:07.859 --> 22:10.487
so we named you
after yellow flowers and corn.

22:10.595 --> 22:12.085
This is you here:

22:14.166 --> 22:18.034
Pretty, golden purslane.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.864
Purslane's really a weed, you know.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.067
A neighbor told me when I was 9
and I ran over his tomato plants.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.303
He said all gardeners hate purslane.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.141
Yeah, and dandelions.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.912
It doesn't stop kids
from making wishes on them.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.519
Purslane's an axillary bloom.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.616
It closes up when the sun goes down.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.121
Thanks.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.239
Damn.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.583
Last time I saw you, you were teeny.

23:13.492 --> 23:17.428
Is there anyone here who doesn't remember
me with Lorraine, or am I the only one?

23:17.496 --> 23:21.432
She used to sing here. I was about your age.
She was something.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.902
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.672
I'll have red beans and rice
and a beer, please.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.140
I hear you'll be staying
at Bobby and Lawson's for a while?

23:34.212 --> 23:37.147
No, I'll be staying at Lorraine's indefinitely.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.477
- Will you be starting school in September?
- No.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.421
I don't go to school. I waitress.
You need one?

23:45.991 --> 23:47.788
No, just me and Uncle Earl.

23:51.363 --> 23:53.297
They know you're not going to school?

23:53.365 --> 23:57.495
They're all torn up about it. Ranks up there
with being out of vodka and cigarettes.

24:01.406 --> 24:04.773
Mother, go make my bed

24:05.677 --> 24:07.804
Make it long and narrow

24:08.847 --> 24:12.305
My true love died for me yesterday

24:13.084 --> 24:16.611
I shall die for him tomorrow

24:19.124 --> 24:22.560
She was buried in the church house yard

24:23.228 --> 24:25.822
And he was buried there beside her

24:26.431 --> 24:30.094
And from his grave grew roses red

24:30.902 --> 24:34.429
From hers grew greenbriers

24:36.942 --> 24:40.309
They grew and they grew so very high

24:41.012 --> 24:43.503
Till they could grow no higher

24:44.182 --> 24:48.448
And at the top grew a true lover's knot

24:49.621 --> 24:54.456
Twined with greenbriers

24:55.126 --> 24:59.859
Y'all, this is Lorraine's daughter, Pursey.
She's gonna stay with us for a while.

25:01.766 --> 25:02.892
Come on in.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.227
- You grew up real pretty.
- Thank you.

25:05.303 --> 25:07.328
Make yourself at home, darling.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.608
I'm Ruthie. My gentleman friend, Ray.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.840
Here 26 years.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.906
Go on and relax, baby. Drink your beer.

25:17.382 --> 25:18.644
Find anything?

25:19.284 --> 25:21.013
I filled out a few applications.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.986
You let that fresh young thing
live with you?

25:23.054 --> 25:24.646
She's fresh, all right.

25:25.257 --> 25:29.557
I remember when there was a new one
every night. Y'all was pussy magnets.

25:30.161 --> 25:33.153
Which one of y'all snores
like a goddamn train?

25:33.231 --> 25:36.029
Bobby. If he's on his back,
you have to turn him over.

25:36.101 --> 25:40.834
I saw this program on the Medical Channel
that you can cure people of snoring...

25:40.906 --> 25:43.067
by cutting their throats open.

25:49.581 --> 25:53.176
I believe that I do have a story
for you gentlemen.

25:53.985 --> 25:56.112
Quiet. Bobby's gonna tell a story.

25:56.254 --> 26:00.486
When I was growing up, I always hung
around boys a couple years older than me.

26:02.961 --> 26:06.124
And this one summer,
I was, I don't know, 10 or 11.

26:06.932 --> 26:11.665
And we were doing all the normal things
that boys in Alabama do.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.033
We were fishing...

26:14.239 --> 26:17.367
and playing ball,
and swimming, and beating off.

26:20.178 --> 26:24.114
But in addition to these activities
of an innocent childhood...

26:24.349 --> 26:27.250
mine included a lot of talk...

26:27.786 --> 26:32.314
about this wonderfully
elusive something called pussy.

26:33.558 --> 26:35.583
I wasn't sure exactly what it was...

26:35.660 --> 26:40.063
but I knew it was magical and very special
because of the way it was spoken about.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.528
Always in a whisper.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.897
I'd go through the fields
saying it to myself: "Pussy."

26:51.576 --> 26:53.601
One day, we was all...

26:54.212 --> 26:56.874
playing ball out in a broom sage field.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.847
And up rode Leroy Tuberville.

27:01.920 --> 27:06.482
Now, Leroy was
an upstanding delinquent. Twelve.

27:07.325 --> 27:11.659
And his shoulders were already broad,
and his fingers were stained with tobacco.

27:12.530 --> 27:16.899
And Leroy, he parked himself casually
by third base, and he went in his pocket...

27:17.702 --> 27:21.934
and he pulled out something. He started
throwing it high in the air like that.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.740
And I watched him play it cool...

27:25.810 --> 27:28.643
his mysterious jewel going up and down.

27:30.248 --> 27:33.046
I couldn't take it any longer. I had to ask.

27:33.118 --> 27:35.245
"What's that you got there, Leroy?"

27:35.987 --> 27:37.716
And everyone fell silent.

27:38.923 --> 27:43.087
And Leroy looked at me
with that nasty sideways grin...

27:43.528 --> 27:47.828
and he said,
"It's a piece of pussy, Long. My very own."

27:49.734 --> 27:52.328
My face got hot, my breath quickened.

27:53.938 --> 27:58.807
There he was, with this perfect piece of girl,
tossing her up in the air.

27:59.778 --> 28:04.112
And I watched, knowing that I had seen God
for the first time.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.611
And I wanted her for my very own.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.155
But old Leroy popped his treasure
between his teeth...

28:13.758 --> 28:16.454
jumped on his bike grinning at me,
and rode off...

28:16.528 --> 28:19.622
leaving us in a cloud of dust and desire.

28:20.231 --> 28:24.327
And it was in that tormented haze,
at the age of 10...

28:25.036 --> 28:27.596
when I dedicated the rest of my life...

28:27.872 --> 28:32.502
to finding my very own tiny piece
of love and wonder...

28:32.944 --> 28:35.435
that I could carry with me for eternity.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.381
All right, that's it. I'm going home.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.718
To Florida?

28:46.825 --> 28:48.986
Now, look, be careful.

28:49.294 --> 28:52.161
"We cannot tear out
a single page of our lives...

28:52.230 --> 28:54.858
"but we can throw
the whole book in the fire."

28:55.934 --> 28:57.424
George Sand.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.137
I thought that would be a hard one.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.173
I don't feel right about lying to her.

29:08.012 --> 29:11.345
What would a teenage hussy want
with this place, anyway?

29:11.416 --> 29:15.284
Said herself it was a shithole.
She's better off.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.586
Besides, when you sell that book,
everything will change...

29:20.658 --> 29:21.852
Change?

29:23.294 --> 29:26.263
We'll go to Paris, drink '61 Latour...

29:26.331 --> 29:29.767
write bad poetry.
Yes, everything will be just perfect.

29:37.742 --> 29:42.236
"We die only once,
and for such a long time."

29:46.484 --> 29:47.712
Molière.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.623
She's here, honey.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.928
I'll take better care of her this time.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.067
See you tomorrow, darling.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.543
Your mama used to come here a lot.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.452
Why do you talk about her so much?

30:27.025 --> 30:28.822
Because I miss her, I guess.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.694
Were you in love with her or something?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.793
We all loved her.

30:38.736 --> 30:42.763
- She knew how to reach people, you know?
- No, not really.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.473
The night before my grandma died...

30:45.543 --> 30:48.478
she warned me that
Lorraine would always be selfish.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.313
She finally told me about my father.

30:53.451 --> 30:54.816
She did, did she?

30:55.286 --> 30:57.311
Some sax player in Memphis.

30:58.056 --> 30:59.990
Pretty much a one-night stand.

31:02.026 --> 31:06.360
I think Gran wanted me to know that when
she was gone, I'd be totally on my own.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.496
She was right.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.966
After she died,
I hardly ever heard from Lorraine.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.571
Never even got a chance to hear her sing.

31:14.672 --> 31:18.608
Your mama loved you, you know?
You meant the world to her.

31:27.285 --> 31:30.254
She used to sit
right where you're sitting now.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.954
Always writing.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.957
Called this granddaddy the Tree of Life.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.317
That's so corny.

31:49.307 --> 31:52.970
- You're in the wrong appliance.
- What?

31:54.212 --> 31:57.704
To succeed in killing oneself,
one must be in the oven.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.376
God damn, girl. You woke up productive.

32:04.489 --> 32:08.516
- Come see what Pursey did.
- Christ. Stop yelling.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.188
I see what she didn't do: Leave.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.561
She ain't gonna leave.

32:19.203 --> 32:21.603
That's a really good look for you, too.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.248
Good morning to y'all, too.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.710
No school, I hear. What, you skip a grade?

32:38.756 --> 32:41.884
A few. The 10th, 11th, and 12th.
Do you mind?

32:41.960 --> 32:46.056
God, we are living under the same roof
as a goddamn dropout.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.630
It takes one to mock one.
At least I can support myself.

32:50.134 --> 32:54.195
Look, as long as
you're not lazing around here...

32:54.272 --> 32:58.709
making Lawson lose his concentration,
I do not care what you do.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.971
You got work to do.

33:05.249 --> 33:08.116
Do you have to go after her
like that, relentlessly?

33:08.186 --> 33:10.780
Do you want her to stick around?
Is that what you want?

33:10.855 --> 33:15.315
Has it ever occurred to you that if we help
her get on her feet, she might move on?

33:15.526 --> 33:17.084
How help her?

33:17.328 --> 33:21.025
You want to help her out of
them tight little pants. That's what you want.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.533
- Forget it, man, all right?
- Forgotten.

33:28.439 --> 33:31.738
A New Orleans summer
drowns in thick, dank stillness.

33:40.451 --> 33:42.351
Come on, man, let's play gin.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.389
- Can't you see us doing something here?
- To hell with you.

33:45.456 --> 33:50.120
Lorraine's house shrank with each
passing day, straining uneasy walls closer.

34:01.572 --> 34:05.008
Turn that music off, girl!
Can't you see he's working?

34:19.524 --> 34:20.650
Jesus H. Christ.

34:20.725 --> 34:24.717
How long you gonna sit around here
smoking up our cigarette money?

34:24.896 --> 34:26.693
Lawson said he didn't mind.

34:27.931 --> 34:31.094
Lawson's cigarettes are red. Mine are green.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.529
You may not smoke green. Bobby's.

34:42.647 --> 34:46.174
What is that shit you are drinking?
God, it reeks.

34:46.451 --> 34:48.715
This is beer and tomato juice.

34:48.953 --> 34:50.887
Breakfast of champions.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.521
Champion fuckup, maybe.

34:56.194 --> 34:59.891
You know, girl, I have had
just about enough of your bad attitude.

35:00.665 --> 35:04.260
Whether you like it or not,
I am the senior male in this house...

35:04.335 --> 35:06.200
and you will respect me!

35:09.006 --> 35:12.407
We have been very patient
out of respect for Lorraine...

35:13.044 --> 35:15.638
but you will not continue
to lay around here...

35:15.713 --> 35:18.147
and play parasite to our generosity.

35:19.050 --> 35:22.577
Now, you must work
as if you're gonna live 100 years...

35:23.654 --> 35:26.122
and pray as if you're gonna die tomorrow.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.387
- What did you say?
- Ben Franklin said it.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.724
It probably meant something
coming from him.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.162
You know damn well
I've been looking for a job.

35:34.232 --> 35:38.362
God, what do you do? Except shit around
and talk about how smart you used to be.

35:38.436 --> 35:41.667
I am a professor. I am a troubadour. A poet.

35:41.739 --> 35:44.435
And it's none of your damn business
how we live.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.740
- You are responsible for your share.
- My share?

35:47.812 --> 35:49.575
You already live in my house for free.

35:49.647 --> 35:52.047
- God, you should be grateful...
- This is our house!

35:52.116 --> 35:54.846
Maybe you'd rather I earn money
bringing friends home.

35:54.919 --> 35:58.320
Didn't Lorraine have to do that for a while?
Most junkies do.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.118
God damn it!

36:01.192 --> 36:03.285
Have you no respect for the dead?

36:03.661 --> 36:05.822
That was your mother, Pursey.

36:11.769 --> 36:13.134
Besides...

36:14.872 --> 36:17.602
we all know
that you ain't no angel of purity...

36:18.442 --> 36:20.501
are you, little Purslane?

36:22.280 --> 36:25.647
Did you ever have two men at once?
Have you?

36:25.750 --> 36:29.447
That would buy a lot of cigarettes
in our house. It would, wouldn't it?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.317
Fuck you!

36:32.390 --> 36:35.587
You're supposed to be the senior male?
The grownup.

36:35.660 --> 36:39.027
I'm just a girl. Don't you get that?

36:39.096 --> 36:43.260
I'm so sick of your high and mighty attitude
about poor, dead Lorraine.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.201
You wanna teach me about respect?
Who respects you?

36:46.270 --> 36:50.969
The wife who's smart enough to get rid
of you, or the kids you never fucking see?

36:52.310 --> 36:54.505
What did I tell you about her?

36:56.113 --> 36:58.047
Oh, God!

37:54.939 --> 37:57.430
You know, I know what y'all think of me.

37:58.609 --> 38:01.737
- School just seemed like a waste of time.
- It's not.

38:02.980 --> 38:06.416
I know that.
I'm not some dumb kid, you know.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.981
I wanna be normal. It's just not my life.

38:10.921 --> 38:13.253
What is your life? What do you want?

38:14.592 --> 38:16.560
If I could do anything?

38:20.364 --> 38:22.059
Promise you won't laugh?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.963
I don't know if I can promise.

38:25.036 --> 38:28.836
Well, I thought about maybe working
in a hospital or something...

38:29.006 --> 38:32.032
like being an x-ray technician
or something like that.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.033
Okay.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.740
- Can I ask why?
- I don't know.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.511
I like the way bones look on a light box.

38:42.586 --> 38:45.885
They're like portraits, but on the inside.

38:47.758 --> 38:50.386
I know it does sound totally stupid.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.527
No, it's not stupid.

39:05.776 --> 39:06.868
Hello?

39:08.112 --> 39:11.104
Hello? Is anyone there?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.025
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.800
I keep forgetting
there's a woman in the house.

40:22.486 --> 40:23.953
Any sign of him?

40:24.021 --> 40:26.649
Listen, Pursey, I need to tell you something.

40:28.492 --> 40:30.483
What, you worried about him?

40:35.533 --> 40:37.262
What are you doing today?

40:37.868 --> 40:39.995
I thought I'd go down to the Quarter...

40:40.070 --> 40:42.595
Iook for a job. I haven't tried there yet.

40:43.407 --> 40:45.807
Want someone to show you around?

41:00.825 --> 41:03.692
- Give us a call next week.
- All right, thanks.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.490
Well?

41:07.498 --> 41:10.433
Maybe, but only part-time.

41:10.935 --> 41:14.063
It's not like you have rent.
You don't have to work full-time.

41:14.138 --> 41:17.835
I need to get away
from Bobby full-time. Overtime.

41:18.442 --> 41:22.173
Maybe I could help you get started
on those bone portraits.

41:22.346 --> 41:24.337
You can get your GED, you know.

41:24.682 --> 41:27.242
Sure I can. Then maybe I can go to Harvard.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.278
Maybe.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.601
You know, you eat like shit?

41:45.202 --> 41:46.669
You drink too much.

41:47.738 --> 41:48.727
Okay.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.366
Would you let me read your book sometime?

41:51.442 --> 41:53.535
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

41:53.677 --> 41:57.636
- Most of it ends up in the trash.
- How long you been writing it?

41:58.082 --> 42:00.209
Too long, and not long enough.

42:00.751 --> 42:04.152
- Did you graduate from college?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

42:04.221 --> 42:07.884
With the privilege of becoming
Bobby Long's teaching assistant.

42:09.126 --> 42:11.560
Why did y'all leave that school?

42:13.063 --> 42:16.328
It's complicated. So many reasons.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.362
Tell me one.

42:22.306 --> 42:24.433
A lot happened real fast...

42:25.576 --> 42:27.373
and New Orleans, all this...

42:27.978 --> 42:30.344
it sort of seemed romantic at the time.

42:31.782 --> 42:32.976
Is it?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.776
Is it romantic?

42:40.524 --> 42:42.287
It has its moments.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.160
Would you really help me get my GED?

42:51.068 --> 42:52.558
Yes, I really would.

42:53.837 --> 42:55.532
- Why?
- Why not?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.897
Don't have anything else to do.

42:58.442 --> 43:00.740
Would you quit drinking so much?

43:02.112 --> 43:03.101
Why?

43:04.448 --> 43:07.315
Why not?
You don't have anything else to do.

43:12.356 --> 43:13.618
All right.

43:15.459 --> 43:16.790
All right.

43:37.915 --> 43:40.383
So, where is he, the son of a bitch?

43:41.218 --> 43:45.587
Probably on some barstool somewhere,
whining about how misunderstood he is.

43:45.789 --> 43:49.520
You've better things to do than waste
another day worrying about Bobby Long.

43:49.593 --> 43:52.653
He didn't. We had a nice day, didn't we?

43:54.832 --> 43:55.821
Yeah.

44:01.505 --> 44:03.996
Come on, darling, we better get home.

44:05.042 --> 44:06.600
See you at home.

44:12.883 --> 44:15.909
It must be getting pretty crowded for you,
only two rooms.

44:15.986 --> 44:19.114
What about your work, sugar?
There's no privacy there.

44:19.189 --> 44:21.282
You could stay at my place.

44:23.260 --> 44:25.160
Will you think about it?

44:34.672 --> 44:35.934
I'm back.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.333
Aren't you people glad to see me?

44:40.411 --> 44:42.402
- No.
- You might have called.

44:43.213 --> 44:45.807
Well, then ask me. Say:

44:46.150 --> 44:48.584
"Bobby, what have you brought me?"

44:52.723 --> 44:53.883
Biloxi?

44:55.793 --> 44:57.920
Video poker or nickel slots?

44:59.063 --> 45:01.361
- Man, where's my car?
- I sold it.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.731
Now, Pursey, go put some music on.
We're gonna celebrate.

45:07.171 --> 45:10.140
- You what?
- I sold it. We didn't need a car.

45:10.607 --> 45:14.202
This is a single malt. When was the last time
you had a single malt?

45:14.278 --> 45:16.303
- For how much?
- $300.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.543
You fucking sold my car for fucking $300?

45:19.616 --> 45:21.447
Have you lost
your goddamn mind completely?

45:21.518 --> 45:23.042
Just hold that punch.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.878
Now, you remember...

45:25.589 --> 45:27.420
I have a broken face.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.293
Now, I didn't have any money.

45:32.930 --> 45:35.398
That's because your check is here.

45:35.499 --> 45:39.162
And this, too. From the lawyer.
It's time to tell her.

45:39.703 --> 45:42.900
I waited for you to get the...
What the fuck are you doing?

45:42.973 --> 45:46.932
You give me five minutes,
and then you do what you think is right.

45:50.881 --> 45:53.748
Well, look how nice
you changed everything.

45:55.552 --> 46:00.285
I'd have destroyed that TV weeks ago
if I'd known it would drive you to Steinbeck.

46:00.624 --> 46:03.184
All right, now, I have something to tell y'all.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.921
Come on in, sit down.

46:06.630 --> 46:08.154
Come on, man, sit...

46:08.665 --> 46:12.192
Will you stop grieving
about that hunk of shit and sit down?

46:12.269 --> 46:13.531
I'll stand.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.201
All right, close your eyes.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.904
- Close your eyes, man.
- I'm not closing my goddamn eyes.

46:20.978 --> 46:22.775
Come on, Lawson. Christ.

46:26.083 --> 46:27.345
All right, now.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.644
You can open them now, darling.

46:32.556 --> 46:34.683
Courtesy of a lovely teacher...

46:34.792 --> 46:38.694
whose heart once found Bobby Long
cause enough to skip a beat or two.

46:38.762 --> 46:42.289
"To certify that Purslane Hominy Will...

46:42.432 --> 46:45.299
"has successfully completed
the 11th grade...

46:45.369 --> 46:48.133
"and is recommended to the 12th grade."

46:48.772 --> 46:51.400
"Why stay we on earth except to grow?"

46:59.082 --> 47:00.447
Robert Browning.

47:00.517 --> 47:03.543
He's definitely your run-of-the-mill
senior-year poet.

47:04.521 --> 47:06.648
Is this really your idea of an apology...

47:06.723 --> 47:09.658
or are you just trying to one-up
his GED offer?

47:11.295 --> 47:12.694
Great minds.

47:18.569 --> 47:20.696
Come on, man.
Of course she takes a language.

47:20.771 --> 47:23.262
- You want to speak French, don't you?
- Don't be an ass.

47:23.340 --> 47:26.309
You know that
she can't take French 1 as a senior.

47:26.443 --> 47:27.569
All right.

47:28.011 --> 47:32.380
So we got English Lit, European History,
Geography, Psychology.

47:32.449 --> 47:34.041
We need one more.

47:34.585 --> 47:37.019
- I think Art Appreciation.
- Music.

47:37.087 --> 47:39.555
- I think she'd like music.
- I'm not going.

47:43.327 --> 47:45.761
Well, God damn, it's already set up.

47:45.829 --> 47:48.992
Do you know how much I had to go through
for you for this?

47:49.066 --> 47:52.627
For me? You expect me to...
Come on. What's in it for you?

47:53.737 --> 47:56.797
Firstly, it'll get you out of the house,
for my sanity.

47:56.874 --> 47:59.570
- That's what I thought.
- No, look.

47:59.877 --> 48:02.607
You said something to me recently.
It got me thinking.

48:02.679 --> 48:04.806
You said, "I'm just a girl."

48:05.549 --> 48:09.610
Maybe I've grown too calloused
over the years, but you are just a girl.

48:10.320 --> 48:14.347
Not unlike the students
that flowed through my classes years ago.

48:15.993 --> 48:18.621
And I know that
we must seem horrible to you...

48:18.695 --> 48:22.153
but we still got something to offer. We must.

48:24.801 --> 48:28.066
And besides,
I think we owe it to your mother.

48:30.073 --> 48:32.200
And as hard is it is to believe...

48:32.643 --> 48:36.079
we, too, once were innocent children.

48:36.213 --> 48:38.113
You are such a shameless ham.

48:39.016 --> 48:41.280
What makes you think I could do this?

48:42.519 --> 48:44.783
Because we know God, and God knows us.

48:45.355 --> 48:48.188
And he and Lorraine brought you here
for a reason.

48:49.393 --> 48:51.020
School starts in a month.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.494
You can give us a chance. It might be fun.

48:53.563 --> 48:55.394
"Fun" is a stretch, don't you think?

48:55.465 --> 48:58.832
Listen, sweetheart,
that's one of your mama's songs.

49:00.370 --> 49:02.031
That's beautiful.

49:06.143 --> 49:07.838
She'd be so proud.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.588
What do you think of my face?

50:02.866 --> 50:05.357
See this bone? It's broken.

50:05.602 --> 50:07.229
But you can move it.

50:10.474 --> 50:12.169
How'd that happen?

50:13.076 --> 50:16.170
"Never fight fair with a stranger."
Arthur Miller.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.837
That happened in a fight? You lost?

50:20.317 --> 50:22.683
Well, I lost a lot more than the fight.

50:24.988 --> 50:28.287
Does it take away from my appearance,
in your opinion, miss?

50:29.326 --> 50:31.453
I think you're still handsome.

50:31.728 --> 50:34.424
Well, aren't y'all sweet?

50:36.466 --> 50:39.367
Are you having sexual intercourse
with one another?

50:41.638 --> 50:44.869
- Okay, Dr. Ruth, let's go.
- It's all right if you are.

50:45.142 --> 50:46.541
Sex is nice.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.544
Just remember to be kind to one another.

50:49.646 --> 50:53.605
And stay young as long as you can.
Your youth is fleeting. Be kind.

50:54.985 --> 50:56.782
We should start with memorization.

50:56.853 --> 50:59.253
I think we should stick to
the Socratic method.

50:59.322 --> 51:02.814
You do? Just exactly who is Plato
and who is Socrates...

51:02.893 --> 51:05.088
in this arrangement?
Because I'll just stay out.

51:05.162 --> 51:07.130
You are Socrates, of course.

51:07.197 --> 51:09.688
- You are the Teacher.
- You're goddamn right I am.

51:09.766 --> 51:11.393
I wish y'all would just shut up...

51:11.468 --> 51:14.460
because if it's gonna be like this,
I ain't learning nothing.

51:14.538 --> 51:17.268
Girl, your English is fucking atrocious.

51:18.475 --> 51:20.375
Purslane Hominy, sit up.

51:20.710 --> 51:22.439
Why can't I study in bed?

51:22.546 --> 51:24.878
It's so hot,
and this chair is so uncomfortable.

51:24.948 --> 51:28.543
It is not supposed to be comfortable.
It'll put your brain to sleep. Sit up.

51:28.618 --> 51:31.746
- It's just bad habits.
- You're talking to me about bad habits?

51:31.822 --> 51:34.484
Don't fuck with the Teacher, okay?

51:35.058 --> 51:39.051
Just tell me what is Nebraska's role
in American Literature? Go.

51:39.129 --> 51:43.327
- Shouldn't I be learning the state capitals?
- Bullshit. You'll learn what matters.

51:43.400 --> 51:46.028
- Don't procrastinate.
- By whatever do you mean?

51:46.103 --> 51:48.765
I don't have a card for procrastinate.

51:48.839 --> 51:51.137
You are just incorrigible.

51:58.048 --> 51:59.310
"Procrastinate.

51:59.549 --> 52:02.040
"To drag one's ass
in such a pathetic manner...

52:02.119 --> 52:05.054
"as to ensure one's place in life as a loser."

52:05.122 --> 52:07.420
Hey, who are you calling a loser?

52:08.792 --> 52:10.089
- Fuck.
- Go.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.594
All right, Nebraska.

52:12.696 --> 52:16.257
Home state of Willa Cather,
one of our first successful female authors.

52:16.333 --> 52:19.029
Or should I move east to Missouri,
where Mark Twain...

52:19.102 --> 52:21.764
alias Samuel Clemens, was born,
or down south to Kansas...

52:21.838 --> 52:23.965
where William Burroughs
spent his last years?

52:24.040 --> 52:26.474
- Stop!
- Hey, man...

52:26.543 --> 52:29.273
I don't think they'll teach Burroughs
at Catholic school.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.836
Well, they ought to.

52:45.395 --> 52:47.886
Why don't you pour your old buddy a drink?

52:47.998 --> 52:51.331
- We're out of juice.
- Well, what's in that glass?

52:52.402 --> 52:54.063
It doesn't have a smell.

52:54.137 --> 52:57.197
Well, God damn it,
pour some vodka in it then.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.539
- Go ahead.
- We gotta quit.

53:01.811 --> 53:05.941
I promised Pursey if she'd study.
I mean, look at us. We're worthless.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.744
And when was that, that you quit?

53:10.687 --> 53:13.554
Nineteen hours ago, when we were quizzing.

53:16.927 --> 53:19.896
- Did you get some sleep?
- No.

53:23.366 --> 53:26.767
There's no rush for her or for us...

53:27.470 --> 53:30.837
so if you want to quit, take it slow.

53:31.675 --> 53:33.233
Now, trust me on this.

53:33.610 --> 53:36.170
Take away the bottle, take away the genie.

54:33.303 --> 54:35.203
Hey, what are you doing here?

54:38.008 --> 54:40.738
I just thought I'd give Lawson a break.

54:41.011 --> 54:43.502
Let him use the bedroom.
Come on, sit down.

54:50.954 --> 54:53.320
You look very pretty today, Purslane.

54:53.723 --> 54:56.886
No one calls me that
but my dead grandmother, but thanks.

54:57.193 --> 54:59.354
Now, you remember how to get there?

54:59.863 --> 55:03.424
I know where it is all right,
so I guess I should be going.

55:05.068 --> 55:06.262
You nervous?

55:07.237 --> 55:08.226
No.

55:10.874 --> 55:11.966
Yeah.

55:13.710 --> 55:16.076
Want me to take the streetcar with you?

55:16.746 --> 55:18.373
No, I'll be okay.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.718
Well, I know you'll just do fine.

55:24.187 --> 55:26.951
And we'll be right here
when you get back from school...

55:27.023 --> 55:28.820
to help you with your homework.

55:28.892 --> 55:31.520
Christ, you're really living
in some parallel universe.

55:31.594 --> 55:33.858
Me and "homework" in the same sentence.

55:41.871 --> 55:45.773
It's about to become you and "tardy"
in the same sentence, so...

56:01.925 --> 56:03.517
Think she'll come right home?

56:03.593 --> 56:06.255
Where else would a teenage girl go
but straight home...

56:06.329 --> 56:08.695
to her endlessly entertaining
middle-aged roommates?

56:08.765 --> 56:12.326
She's no picnic.
Tortures me with that noise.

56:13.570 --> 56:17.165
That child should know
anything worth listening to is on vinyl.

56:17.941 --> 56:19.272
My kids knew it.

56:20.443 --> 56:23.276
I taught them. I was their father.

56:25.248 --> 56:26.476
You still are.

56:31.554 --> 56:35.354
One day they'll understand,
when you finish that book.

56:39.362 --> 56:41.193
My kids don't even know me.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.629
Shit, can we do anything besides this?

56:44.701 --> 56:46.635
- Like what?
- Fuck if I know.

56:46.703 --> 56:49.695
- We could go fishing.
- You don't fish.

56:51.307 --> 56:52.934
Maybe I should start...

56:54.844 --> 56:56.175
something.

56:56.246 --> 56:59.044
Maybe you should start working
on your damn book.

57:01.184 --> 57:03.550
I don't know the end of the story yet.

57:04.287 --> 57:07.313
Checkmate. Let's get out of here.
We're depressing me.

57:11.561 --> 57:13.529
You know, I wanna say something...

57:13.596 --> 57:17.293
about life, because an unexamined life...

57:17.367 --> 57:20.461
- is simply a life...
- Not worth living.

57:21.104 --> 57:23.629
Purslane, our prodigy has returned.

57:23.706 --> 57:25.731
Now, tell us everything.

57:27.877 --> 57:30.675
Honey, why did you leave school early?

57:33.950 --> 57:35.611
I didn't belong there.

57:35.685 --> 57:39.621
I appreciate what y'all are doing,
but I'm not going back.

57:39.989 --> 57:41.115
What?

57:41.624 --> 57:43.421
I really need a job.

57:46.129 --> 57:49.621
- You can work here on the weekends, sugar.
- Really?

57:50.600 --> 57:54.366
- Only if you're in school, though.
- Good one, Earl.

58:09.385 --> 58:12.286
Autumn comes slowly in New Orleans.

58:13.289 --> 58:15.484
The grass remains a stubborn green...

58:15.558 --> 58:18.118
but the heat gives way to a gentle warmth.

58:19.062 --> 58:21.758
Pursey did begin to catch on in school.

58:22.332 --> 58:25.495
She was surprised. We weren't.

58:28.071 --> 58:31.905
Winter arrived before we realized
the sunlit hours of summer had waned.

58:37.981 --> 58:40.506
Somehow, the wine began
to outlast the day...

58:44.354 --> 58:47.221
and that was more than
anyone could have asked for.

58:57.033 --> 59:01.060
Someone should have told them Creoles we
got something called winter in Louisiana.

59:01.137 --> 59:03.332
We might have improved
on their oversight...

59:03.406 --> 59:05.874
with this cool new invention called heat.

59:06.109 --> 59:09.101
- Pursey, where'd you put the vodka?
- You told me to hide it.

59:09.178 --> 59:11.669
I did. But where did you hide it?

59:11.881 --> 59:13.940
I'm not supposed to tell you, remember?

59:14.017 --> 59:16.577
You don't do anything else I tell you to do.
Where is it?

59:16.653 --> 59:20.555
Lawson, Bobby's trying to get me
to tell him where the vodka is again.

59:21.724 --> 59:25.490
- It is Christmas.
- Whatever. It's under the back stairs.

59:26.696 --> 59:29.927
And I could have sworn
it was your turn to do the laundry.

59:29.999 --> 59:32.490
Don't forget to use the cuddly bear stuff.

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:03.457
But you aren't a virgin, are you?

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:07.165
You know, some people would call you
a disgusting old man...

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:08.931
for your constant sexual harassment.

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:12.463
I believe the term is "dirty old man,"
not "disgusting."

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.911
And you are a young, blooming bud.

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:19.876
- Let me live vicariously. You aren't, are you?
- Are you?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.042
Well, I have children.

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.750
Why don't you ever see them?

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:28.787
Well, that's a good question.
But you haven't answered mine.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:32.220
You know, I'm trying to be serious for once,
Bobby. God.

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:40.358
The truth is, I wish I could see them.
I miss them like hell.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:46.708
It seems to me
if someone wanted to see their kids...

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:50.177
then they damn well would,
unless they didn't give a shit.

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:17.957
What are you doing here?

01:02:18.064 --> 01:02:20.999
Georgianna went a half hour ago.
You're gonna miss it.

01:02:21.067 --> 01:02:22.796
Put that on my tab.

01:02:23.603 --> 01:02:25.002
Your bill.

01:02:25.138 --> 01:02:28.039
"Tab" sounds like
y'all might pay it someday.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:19.817
Time was never a friend to Bobby Long.

01:04:20.353 --> 01:04:22.480
It would conspire against him...

01:04:22.555 --> 01:04:26.958
allow him to believe in a generous nature,
then rob him blind every time.

01:04:31.865 --> 01:04:34.629
We had lost Lorraine, all of us...

01:04:34.901 --> 01:04:36.926
but long before she died.

01:04:50.116 --> 01:04:52.778
You can't park here.
You'll get another ticket.

01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:55.480
I don't see no signs, Miss Daisy.

01:05:02.996 --> 01:05:05.863
It's all right.
I can walk to the curb from here.

01:05:07.901 --> 01:05:09.368
Get me a beer.

01:05:34.627 --> 01:05:36.094
You find a job?

01:05:36.596 --> 01:05:38.427
You clean the fuck up?

01:05:38.832 --> 01:05:41.130
That Bobby guy called again today.

01:05:43.369 --> 01:05:46.202
- Again?
- He called a couple of days ago, remember?

01:05:46.439 --> 01:05:48.907
No, you didn't tell me. What did he want?

01:05:49.576 --> 01:05:52.909
He wanted to tell you about Lorraine.

01:05:53.713 --> 01:05:55.203
What about her?

01:05:58.084 --> 01:05:59.415
She died.

01:06:00.286 --> 01:06:01.583
She what?

01:06:02.188 --> 01:06:05.555
She's dead, all right? He called
because he thought you'd wanna know.

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:08.219
Lorraine died and you didn't tell me?

01:06:10.196 --> 01:06:13.222
To Lorraine. May she finally find peace.

01:06:17.237 --> 01:06:20.764
So, now what?
Lorraine finally kick y'all out?

01:06:24.477 --> 01:06:25.535
No.

01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:30.282
She never would.
Besides, God wouldn't let that happen.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.316
Really? And why not?

01:06:35.421 --> 01:06:37.946
'Cause God knows me, and I know God.

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:40.016
Go.

01:06:40.527 --> 01:06:43.052
Cecil's pretty torn up. Make sure he eats.

01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:45.731
I'll see you later.

01:06:50.603 --> 01:06:52.594
She never meant nothing to you...

01:06:52.672 --> 01:06:56.540
and you didn't mean a damn thing to her.
I didn't think you would care.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.307
Come on, baby, stop.

01:07:01.814 --> 01:07:04.544
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:08.848
Why don't you just cook me some dinner
and I'll go rent us a porno?

01:07:08.922 --> 01:07:10.856
I have to go to a funeral, Lee...

01:07:10.924 --> 01:07:14.223
unless I missed it
because you forgot to tell me...

01:07:14.294 --> 01:07:18.731
that my mother is dead!
Fucking asshole. I am so out of here.

01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:20.561
She was never your mother!

01:07:26.673 --> 01:07:29.733
Purslane? This is Bobby Long again.

01:07:30.009 --> 01:07:32.239
I don't know if you remember me...

01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:38.276
but you missed your mama's funeral.

01:07:39.852 --> 01:07:41.046
So long.

01:07:42.388 --> 01:07:43.855
You got any smokes?

01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:45.817
Sorry, sir.

01:07:49.529 --> 01:07:52.157
- Y'all going down to Cecil's?
- In a minute.

01:07:52.732 --> 01:07:54.859
- I'll see you guys.
- See you there.

01:07:56.803 --> 01:07:58.100
You got a light?

01:07:58.171 --> 01:08:00.662
- I thought you didn't have any.
- I don't.

01:08:00.907 --> 01:08:02.204
Not for Junior.

01:08:04.978 --> 01:08:08.072
He's got to cut down.
He's got fierce emphysema.

01:08:08.815 --> 01:08:12.273
That cough sends shivers of mortality
down my spine.

01:08:12.852 --> 01:08:16.151
"He'd make a lovely corpse,"
but I'll make no contribution.

01:08:16.389 --> 01:08:19.825
Of course not. "Contribute only
to one's own death." That's my motto.

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:22.053
Did you get the girl? She know anything?

01:08:22.127 --> 01:08:25.529
- "He'd make a lovely corpse."
- Come on, man. Charles Dickens.

01:08:25.932 --> 01:08:28.492
Are you serious? It's Martin Chuzzlewit.

01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:30.162
Smart-ass.

01:08:34.874 --> 01:08:37.308
New Orleans is a siren of a city.

01:08:37.844 --> 01:08:40.176
A place of fables and illusion.

01:08:41.147 --> 01:08:43.671
A place Lorraine had to escape from...

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.241
and Bobby and I had to escape to.

01:08:46.486 --> 01:08:48.147
Away from Alabama...

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:51.412
away from lives
that no longer belonged to us.

01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:58.755
I thought she was getting better
that last time, I really did.

01:08:59.499 --> 01:09:00.727
When was that?

01:09:01.234 --> 01:09:04.397
- A few years ago, at least.
- It'll be six years, October.

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:06.904
Was it that long since we seen her?

01:09:06.973 --> 01:09:08.439
Since you seen her.

01:09:11.243 --> 01:09:13.404
We should have gone
to the hospital with you.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:16.038
You should have done a lot of things.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.720
Coming.

01:10:42.401 --> 01:10:43.993
This Lorraine's house?

01:10:47.106 --> 01:10:48.698
And who are you?

01:10:49.809 --> 01:10:51.834
No one. I just live here.

01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:56.243
Come on in.

01:11:07.994 --> 01:11:09.120
Nice place.

01:11:10.329 --> 01:11:12.661
Thanks. We try.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.933
- You're not old enough to be Bobby.
- That's because I'm Lawson.

01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:24.832
Okay.

01:11:28.114 --> 01:11:31.515
I'm sorry about your mother.
You look a lot like her.

01:11:34.754 --> 01:11:37.416
Sorry to wake you so early. It's barely noon.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:44.552
Bobby. We got company, man. Wake up!

01:11:46.866 --> 01:11:49.334
Honey, put your bags down. We don't bite.

01:11:49.836 --> 01:11:51.235
- Juice?
- No.

01:11:54.774 --> 01:11:56.708
- Bobby, get up. She's here.
- Who?

01:11:56.776 --> 01:11:58.403
- Pursey.
- Who?

01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:00.545
The girl is here. Get up.

01:12:05.818 --> 01:12:07.581
So, when's the funeral?

01:12:09.789 --> 01:12:12.656
It was yesterday. It was real nice.

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:15.325
You should have been there, young lady.

01:12:16.395 --> 01:12:17.885
That's your opinion.

01:12:18.664 --> 01:12:20.996
You must be here for some reason.

01:12:23.002 --> 01:12:25.766
I guess you already know
the deal on the house.

01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:27.398
What deal?

01:12:28.641 --> 01:12:31.201
- The house. Your mother owned it...
- The deal!

01:12:32.111 --> 01:12:33.874
Let me tell you what the deal is.

01:12:33.946 --> 01:12:37.313
The deal is that
Lorraine left the three of us the house.

01:12:37.383 --> 01:12:40.750
Lawson and I are two-thirds,
and you are only one-third.

01:12:42.688 --> 01:12:43.882
She did what?

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:46.788
Lawson and I have been living here
for some time.

01:12:46.859 --> 01:12:49.259
Your mother hasn't lived here for years.

01:12:49.996 --> 01:12:53.295
And I don't believe
that she thought you'd be interested.

01:12:53.366 --> 01:12:55.698
Lorraine was great at being wrong.

01:12:56.903 --> 01:13:01.363
Purslane, honey, we are here to stay.
This is our home.

01:13:01.774 --> 01:13:03.469
It's no big deal...

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:08.070
Lorraine thinking I'd share this shithole
with two alcoholic strangers.

01:13:09.715 --> 01:13:11.649
You are alcoholics, aren't you?

01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:14.208
But we are not strangers.
We were her friends.

01:13:14.287 --> 01:13:15.914
We took care of her.

01:13:16.589 --> 01:13:20.252
And this shithole is just fine for us.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.860
It's not suited for a girl like you.

01:13:25.398 --> 01:13:28.731
I'm getting up out of bed now.
You can watch if you want.

01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.666
It don't matter to me.

01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:34.439
It seems hard to believe...

01:13:35.174 --> 01:13:37.836
that you haven't seen a man naked before.

01:13:38.511 --> 01:13:39.808
Not an old one.

01:13:43.849 --> 01:13:46.477
I know that you're no innocent...

01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:50.614
because I spoke to that boyfriend of yours...

01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:53.386
over on the Redneck Riviera.

01:13:53.459 --> 01:13:55.893
You certainly didn't choose him
for his brains.

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:57.987
You don't know nothing about me.

01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:04.002
I guess that will change
if we all became roommates, wouldn't it?

01:14:08.908 --> 01:14:11.399
I'll see you later. I'm out of cigarettes.

01:14:11.644 --> 01:14:13.407
My brand is on sale.

01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:18.181
Good to see you again, Purslane.

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:20.847
All growed up.

01:14:33.632 --> 01:14:38.069
He's not usually such a jackass.
He's just upset about Lorraine. We all are.

01:14:38.804 --> 01:14:41.170
He's right, you know. I can't stay here.

01:14:42.842 --> 01:14:46.209
It's pretty funny, actually.
My grandma was always talking about...

01:14:46.278 --> 01:14:49.714
the pretty little house
Lorraine was fixing up for me...

01:14:52.118 --> 01:14:55.144
and I guess
that was the Ernest & Julio talking.

01:14:55.221 --> 01:14:56.586
It's fine.

01:14:57.056 --> 01:15:00.890
- There's no real surprises here.
- The hospital sent her stuff.

01:15:03.763 --> 01:15:06.061
Lorraine would want you to have these.

01:15:06.532 --> 01:15:08.659
They went everywhere she did.

01:15:10.336 --> 01:15:11.928
She loved those books.

01:15:16.242 --> 01:15:19.769
I guess I could unload them
at a flea market or something.

01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:27.283
- Here, I'll help you out.
- No, I'm fine.

01:15:32.892 --> 01:15:37.226
I really did want to come to the funeral.
I just never got his message.

01:15:49.742 --> 01:15:52.267
That girl looks so much like Lorraine.

01:15:53.412 --> 01:15:56.040
I remember the first time
you took me to see her sing.

01:15:56.115 --> 01:15:58.310
It was my first time in New Orleans.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.951
I was so taken.

01:16:09.195 --> 01:16:11.163
You were kind of sheltered.

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.457
Choked by that silver spoon.

01:16:15.668 --> 01:16:17.659
I thought she was so beautiful.

01:16:18.671 --> 01:16:19.933
She was.

01:17:32.178 --> 01:17:33.770
What else can I get you boys?

01:17:33.846 --> 01:17:38.078
Did anyone ever tell you that you smell
like a Parisian woman in springtime?

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.448
Every day, at least once. Y'all gonna eat?

01:17:40.519 --> 01:17:42.384
The lawyer could get to her at any time.

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:45.446
So what?
The will says we can stay for a year.

01:17:45.958 --> 01:17:47.653
Should I just come back?

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.856
Do you know how lethal the smell
of a Parisian woman in springtime is?

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:55.660
Not nearly as lethal as
a Louisiana woman who don't give a shit.

01:17:56.635 --> 01:18:01.470
- Eggs and bacon, ma'am. Both of us.
- Cheese on our grits, darling. Please.

01:18:04.443 --> 01:18:06.502
You are fucking shameless.

01:18:33.305 --> 01:18:35.773
Why didn't you use the bed, sweetheart?

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:39.470
- Oh, God.
- I could have come in and cuddled with you.

01:18:39.812 --> 01:18:41.905
That would have been fine with me.

01:18:42.581 --> 01:18:46.142
- We could have spooned together.
- Save it.

01:18:47.152 --> 01:18:49.086
Why'd you give her this?

01:18:55.194 --> 01:18:57.458
This is stories of misfits...

01:18:59.832 --> 01:19:02.562
invisible people. It's beautiful.

01:19:03.569 --> 01:19:05.161
Have you ever read it?

01:19:06.805 --> 01:19:08.636
Have you ever read any book?

01:19:09.808 --> 01:19:12.003
Lorraine didn't know she was a poet.

01:19:14.179 --> 01:19:16.409
I really do enjoy...

01:19:17.182 --> 01:19:18.945
fostering inspiration.

01:19:19.852 --> 01:19:22.878
Lawson's a writer. A fine one, too.

01:19:22.955 --> 01:19:24.149
Really?

01:19:25.157 --> 01:19:27.318
He's writing a book about me.

01:19:27.793 --> 01:19:29.351
That's fascinating.

01:19:29.695 --> 01:19:33.028
"Chapter 1:
I got up, I got drunk, I passed out.

01:19:33.799 --> 01:19:37.360
- "Chapter 2: I got up, I got drunk..."
- Lovely and witty.

01:19:37.836 --> 01:19:40.862
You're an embarrassment of riches,
little girl.

01:19:46.612 --> 01:19:48.079
Which room is mine?

01:19:49.148 --> 01:19:52.811
I'll need a place to stay,
and y'all said I had a right.

01:19:52.985 --> 01:19:56.648
Just figured I'd stay here
until you get fed up and leave.

01:19:56.722 --> 01:19:59.156
We are never leaving. Never!

01:19:59.224 --> 01:20:03.024
- And don't even get it in your mind.
- She should have Lorraine's room.

01:20:03.162 --> 01:20:06.188
- I'll stay out here. I'll bunk with you.
- Okay, fine.

01:20:06.832 --> 01:20:08.959
Are you fucking crazy?

01:20:09.034 --> 01:20:11.969
Better than her poking around
and finding out the truth.

01:20:12.037 --> 01:20:14.972
She won't last.
You're gonna make sure of that.

01:20:15.207 --> 01:20:19.109
Besides, you're always complaining
how your bed is so cold.

01:20:21.313 --> 01:20:23.247
You're too skinny for me.

01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:30.786
- So, y'all are really into books?
- They're mostly Bobby's.

01:20:31.423 --> 01:20:34.517
- That's the plumage of an English professor.
- Him?

01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:37.057
- A professor?
- Yeah, he was a good one.

01:20:37.429 --> 01:20:39.556
And you, you're really a writer?

01:20:39.698 --> 01:20:41.427
Bobby likes to think I am.

01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:44.564
These boxes are all Lorraine's, so...

01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.635
So what?

01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:53.076
- I knew your mother pretty well.
- How well?

01:20:57.015 --> 01:21:01.042
She was hard to understand,
but she kept the door to her heart open.

01:21:01.553 --> 01:21:05.114
The way I heard it,
it was more of a revolving door, wasn't it?

01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:40.381
Purslane Hominy Will.

01:22:42.154 --> 01:22:43.883
How come you know my name?

01:22:45.524 --> 01:22:47.151
I know a lot about you.

01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:51.329
Your mama and I were close
since we were young.

01:22:52.197 --> 01:22:53.596
I helped name you.

01:22:55.667 --> 01:22:57.862
Your mama thought you were golden...

01:22:58.036 --> 01:23:00.664
so we named you
after yellow flowers and corn.

01:23:00.772 --> 01:23:02.262
This is you here:

01:23:04.343 --> 01:23:08.211
Pretty, golden purslane.

01:23:08.914 --> 01:23:11.041
Purslane's really a weed, you know.

01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:14.244
A neighbor told me when I was 9
and I ran over his tomato plants.

01:23:14.319 --> 01:23:16.480
He said all gardeners hate purslane.

01:23:16.555 --> 01:23:18.318
Yeah, and dandelions.

01:23:20.359 --> 01:23:23.089
It doesn't stop kids
from making wishes on them.

01:23:23.762 --> 01:23:25.696
Purslane's an axillary bloom.

01:23:26.598 --> 01:23:28.793
It closes up when the sun goes down.

01:23:34.206 --> 01:23:35.298
Thanks.

01:23:55.427 --> 01:23:56.416
Damn.

01:23:57.496 --> 01:23:59.760
Last time I saw you, you were teeny.

01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:07.605
Is there anyone here who doesn't remember
me with Lorraine, or am I the only one?

01:24:07.673 --> 01:24:11.609
She used to sing here. I was about your age.
She was something.

01:24:13.178 --> 01:24:16.079
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:20.849
I'll have red beans and rice
and a beer, please.

01:24:21.587 --> 01:24:24.317
I hear you'll be staying
at Bobby and Lawson's for a while?

01:24:24.389 --> 01:24:27.324
No, I'll be staying at Lorraine's indefinitely.

01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:32.654
- Will you be starting school in September?
- No.

01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:35.598
I don't go to school. I waitress.
You need one?

01:24:36.168 --> 01:24:37.965
No, just me and Uncle Earl.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.474
They know you're not going to school?

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:47.672
They're all torn up about it. Ranks up there
with being out of vodka and cigarettes.

01:24:51.583 --> 01:24:54.950
Mother, go make my bed

01:24:55.854 --> 01:24:57.981
Make it long and narrow

01:24:59.024 --> 01:25:02.482
My true love died for me yesterday

01:25:03.261 --> 01:25:06.788
I shall die for him tomorrow

01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:12.737
She was buried in the church house yard

01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:15.999
And he was buried there beside her

01:25:16.608 --> 01:25:20.271
And from his grave grew roses red

01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:24.606
From hers grew greenbriers

01:25:27.119 --> 01:25:30.486
They grew and they grew so very high

01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:33.680
Till they could grow no higher

01:25:34.359 --> 01:25:38.625
And at the top grew a true lover's knot

01:25:39.798 --> 01:25:44.633
Twined with greenbriers

01:25:45.303 --> 01:25:50.036
Y'all, this is Lorraine's daughter, Pursey.
She's gonna stay with us for a while.

01:25:51.943 --> 01:25:53.069
Come on in.

01:25:53.311 --> 01:25:55.404
- You grew up real pretty.
- Thank you.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.505
Make yourself at home, darling.

01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:01.785
I'm Ruthie. My gentleman friend, Ray.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.017
Here 26 years.

01:26:04.523 --> 01:26:07.083
Go on and relax, baby. Drink your beer.

01:26:07.559 --> 01:26:08.821
Find anything?

01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:11.190
I filled out a few applications.

01:26:11.263 --> 01:26:13.163
You let that fresh young thing
live with you?

01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:14.823
She's fresh, all right.

01:26:15.434 --> 01:26:19.734
I remember when there was a new one
every night. Y'all was pussy magnets.

01:26:20.338 --> 01:26:23.330
Which one of y'all snores
like a goddamn train?

01:26:23.408 --> 01:26:26.206
Bobby. If he's on his back,
you have to turn him over.

01:26:26.278 --> 01:26:31.011
I saw this program on the Medical Channel
that you can cure people of snoring...

01:26:31.083 --> 01:26:33.244
by cutting their throats open.

01:26:39.758 --> 01:26:43.353
I believe that I do have a story
for you gentlemen.

01:26:44.162 --> 01:26:46.289
Quiet. Bobby's gonna tell a story.

01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:50.663
When I was growing up, I always hung
around boys a couple years older than me.

01:26:53.138 --> 01:26:56.301
And this one summer,
I was, I don't know, 10 or 11.

01:26:57.109 --> 01:27:01.842
And we were doing all the normal things
that boys in Alabama do.

01:27:02.447 --> 01:27:04.210
We were fishing...

01:27:04.416 --> 01:27:07.544
and playing ball,
and swimming, and beating off.

01:27:10.355 --> 01:27:14.291
But in addition to these activities
of an innocent childhood...

01:27:14.526 --> 01:27:17.427
mine included a lot of talk...

01:27:17.963 --> 01:27:22.491
about this wonderfully
elusive something called pussy.

01:27:23.735 --> 01:27:25.760
I wasn't sure exactly what it was...

01:27:25.837 --> 01:27:30.240
but I knew it was magical and very special
because of the way it was spoken about.

01:27:30.976 --> 01:27:32.705
Always in a whisper.

01:27:33.445 --> 01:27:37.074
I'd go through the fields
saying it to myself: "Pussy."

01:27:41.753 --> 01:27:43.778
One day, we was all...

01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:47.051
playing ball out in a broom sage field.

01:27:48.226 --> 01:27:51.024
And up rode Leroy Tuberville.

01:27:52.097 --> 01:27:56.659
Now, Leroy was
an upstanding delinquent. Twelve.

01:27:57.502 --> 01:28:01.836
And his shoulders were already broad,
and his fingers were stained with tobacco.

01:28:02.707 --> 01:28:07.076
And Leroy, he parked himself casually
by third base, and he went in his pocket...

01:28:07.879 --> 01:28:12.111
and he pulled out something. He started
throwing it high in the air like that.

01:28:12.517 --> 01:28:14.917
And I watched him play it cool...

01:28:15.987 --> 01:28:18.820
his mysterious jewel going up and down.

01:28:20.425 --> 01:28:23.223
I couldn't take it any longer. I had to ask.

01:28:23.295 --> 01:28:25.422
"What's that you got there, Leroy?"

01:28:26.164 --> 01:28:27.893
And everyone fell silent.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:33.264
And Leroy looked at me
with that nasty sideways grin...

01:28:33.705 --> 01:28:38.005
and he said,
"It's a piece of pussy, Long. My very own."

01:28:39.911 --> 01:28:42.505
My face got hot, my breath quickened.

01:28:44.115 --> 01:28:48.984
There he was, with this perfect piece of girl,
tossing her up in the air.

01:28:49.955 --> 01:28:54.289
And I watched, knowing that I had seen God
for the first time.

01:28:54.593 --> 01:28:56.788
And I wanted her for my very own.

01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:03.332
But old Leroy popped his treasure
between his teeth...

01:29:03.935 --> 01:29:06.631
jumped on his bike grinning at me,
and rode off...

01:29:06.705 --> 01:29:09.799
leaving us in a cloud of dust and desire.

01:29:10.408 --> 01:29:14.504
And it was in that tormented haze,
at the age of 10...

01:29:15.213 --> 01:29:17.773
when I dedicated the rest of my life...

01:29:18.049 --> 01:29:22.679
to finding my very own tiny piece
of love and wonder...

01:29:23.121 --> 01:29:25.612
that I could carry with me for eternity.

01:29:29.294 --> 01:29:31.558
All right, that's it. I'm going home.

01:29:33.598 --> 01:29:34.895
To Florida?

01:29:37.002 --> 01:29:39.163
Now, look, be careful.

01:29:39.471 --> 01:29:42.338
"We cannot tear out
a single page of our lives...

01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:45.035
"but we can throw
the whole book in the fire."

01:29:46.111 --> 01:29:47.601
George Sand.

01:29:47.846 --> 01:29:50.314
I thought that would be a hard one.

01:29:54.052 --> 01:29:56.350
I don't feel right about lying to her.

01:29:58.189 --> 01:30:01.522
What would a teenage hussy want
with this place, anyway?

01:30:01.593 --> 01:30:05.461
Said herself it was a shithole.
She's better off.

01:30:08.033 --> 01:30:10.763
Besides, when you sell that book,
everything will change...

01:30:10.835 --> 01:30:12.029
Change?

01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:16.440
We'll go to Paris, drink '61 Latour...

01:30:16.508 --> 01:30:19.944
write bad poetry.
Yes, everything will be just perfect.

01:30:27.919 --> 01:30:32.413
"We die only once,
and for such a long time."

01:30:36.661 --> 01:30:37.889
Molière.

01:30:43.435 --> 01:30:44.800
She's here, honey.

01:30:47.739 --> 01:30:50.105
I'll take better care of her this time.

01:30:57.515 --> 01:30:59.244
See you tomorrow, darling.

01:31:08.593 --> 01:31:10.720
Your mama used to come here a lot.

01:31:13.331 --> 01:31:15.629
Why do you talk about her so much?

01:31:17.202 --> 01:31:18.999
Because I miss her, I guess.

01:31:20.505 --> 01:31:22.871
Were you in love with her or something?

01:31:25.343 --> 01:31:26.970
We all loved her.

01:31:28.913 --> 01:31:32.940
- She knew how to reach people, you know?
- No, not really.

01:31:33.785 --> 01:31:35.650
The night before my grandma died...

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:38.655
she warned me that
Lorraine would always be selfish.

01:31:39.124 --> 01:31:41.490
She finally told me about my father.

01:31:43.628 --> 01:31:44.993
She did, did she?

01:31:45.463 --> 01:31:47.488
Some sax player in Memphis.

01:31:48.233 --> 01:31:50.167
Pretty much a one-night stand.

01:31:52.203 --> 01:31:56.537
I think Gran wanted me to know that when
she was gone, I'd be totally on my own.

01:31:57.342 --> 01:31:58.673
She was right.

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:02.143
After she died,
I hardly ever heard from Lorraine.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.748
Never even got a chance to hear her sing.

01:32:04.849 --> 01:32:08.785
Your mama loved you, you know?
You meant the world to her.

01:32:17.462 --> 01:32:20.431
She used to sit
right where you're sitting now.

01:32:20.732 --> 01:32:22.131
Always writing.

01:32:22.734 --> 01:32:25.134
Called this granddaddy the Tree of Life.

01:32:26.004 --> 01:32:27.494
That's so corny.

01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:43.147
- You're in the wrong appliance.
- What?

01:32:44.389 --> 01:32:47.881
To succeed in killing oneself,
one must be in the oven.

01:32:48.493 --> 01:32:51.553
God damn, girl. You woke up productive.

01:32:54.666 --> 01:32:58.693
- Come see what Pursey did.
- Christ. Stop yelling.

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.365
I see what she didn't do: Leave.

01:33:06.077 --> 01:33:07.738
She ain't gonna leave.

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:11.780
That's a really good look for you, too.

01:33:19.457 --> 01:33:21.425
Good morning to y'all, too.

01:33:24.429 --> 01:33:27.887
No school, I hear. What, you skip a grade?

01:33:28.933 --> 01:33:32.061
A few. The 10th, 11th, and 12th.
Do you mind?

01:33:32.137 --> 01:33:36.233
God, we are living under the same roof
as a goddamn dropout.

01:33:36.474 --> 01:33:39.807
It takes one to mock one.
At least I can support myself.

01:33:40.311 --> 01:33:44.372
Look, as long as
you're not lazing around here...

01:33:44.449 --> 01:33:48.886
making Lawson lose his concentration,
I do not care what you do.

01:33:53.658 --> 01:33:55.148
You got work to do.

01:33:55.426 --> 01:33:58.293
Do you have to go after her
like that, relentlessly?

01:33:58.363 --> 01:34:00.957
Do you want her to stick around?
Is that what you want?

01:34:01.032 --> 01:34:05.492
Has it ever occurred to you that if we help
her get on her feet, she might move on?

01:34:05.703 --> 01:34:07.261
How help her?

01:34:07.505 --> 01:34:11.202
You want to help her out of
them tight little pants. That's what you want.

01:34:11.276 --> 01:34:13.710
- Forget it, man, all right?
- Forgotten.

01:34:18.616 --> 01:34:21.915
A New Orleans summer
drowns in thick, dank stillness.

01:34:30.628 --> 01:34:32.528
Come on, man, let's play gin.

01:34:32.597 --> 01:34:35.566
- Can't you see us doing something here?
- To hell with you.

01:34:35.633 --> 01:34:40.297
Lorraine's house shrank with each
passing day, straining uneasy walls closer.

01:34:51.749 --> 01:34:55.185
Turn that music off, girl!
Can't you see he's working?

01:35:09.701 --> 01:35:10.827
Jesus H. Christ.

01:35:10.902 --> 01:35:14.895
How long you gonna sit around here
smoking up our cigarette money?

01:35:15.073 --> 01:35:16.870
Lawson said he didn't mind.

01:35:18.109 --> 01:35:21.272
Lawson's cigarettes are red. Mine are green.

01:35:21.646 --> 01:35:24.706
You may not smoke green. Bobby's.

01:35:32.824 --> 01:35:36.351
What is that shit you are drinking?
God, it reeks.

01:35:36.628 --> 01:35:38.892
This is beer and tomato juice.

01:35:39.130 --> 01:35:41.064
Breakfast of champions.

01:35:43.901 --> 01:35:45.698
Champion fuckup, maybe.

01:35:46.371 --> 01:35:50.068
You know, girl, I have had
just about enough of your bad attitude.

01:35:50.842 --> 01:35:54.437
Whether you like it or not,
I am the senior male in this house...

01:35:54.512 --> 01:35:56.377
and you will respect me!

01:35:59.183 --> 01:36:02.584
We have been very patient
out of respect for Lorraine...

01:36:03.221 --> 01:36:05.815
but you will not continue
to lay around here...

01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:08.324
and play parasite to our generosity.

01:36:09.227 --> 01:36:12.754
Now, you must work
as if you're gonna live 100 years...

01:36:13.831 --> 01:36:16.299
and pray as if you're gonna die tomorrow.

01:36:16.367 --> 01:36:19.564
- What did you say?
- Ben Franklin said it.

01:36:19.637 --> 01:36:21.901
It probably meant something
coming from him.

01:36:21.973 --> 01:36:24.339
You know damn well
I've been looking for a job.

01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:28.539
God, what do you do? Except shit around
and talk about how smart you used to be.

01:36:28.613 --> 01:36:31.844
I am a professor. I am a troubadour. A poet.

01:36:31.916 --> 01:36:34.612
And it's none of your damn business
how we live.

01:36:34.686 --> 01:36:37.917
- You are responsible for your share.
- My share?

01:36:37.989 --> 01:36:39.752
You already live in my house for free.

01:36:39.824 --> 01:36:42.224
- God, you should be grateful...
- This is our house!

01:36:42.293 --> 01:36:45.023
Maybe you'd rather I earn money
bringing friends home.

01:36:45.096 --> 01:36:48.497
Didn't Lorraine have to do that for a while?
Most junkies do.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.295
God damn it!

01:36:51.369 --> 01:36:53.462
Have you no respect for the dead?

01:36:53.838 --> 01:36:55.999
That was your mother, Pursey.

01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:03.311
Besides...

01:37:05.049 --> 01:37:07.779
we all know
that you ain't no angel of purity...

01:37:08.619 --> 01:37:10.678
are you, little Purslane?

01:37:12.457 --> 01:37:15.824
Did you ever have two men at once?
Have you?

01:37:15.927 --> 01:37:19.624
That would buy a lot of cigarettes
in our house. It would, wouldn't it?

01:37:19.697 --> 01:37:21.494
Fuck you!

01:37:22.567 --> 01:37:25.764
You're supposed to be the senior male?
The grownup.

01:37:25.837 --> 01:37:29.204
I'm just a girl. Don't you get that?

01:37:29.273 --> 01:37:33.437
I'm so sick of your high and mighty attitude
about poor, dead Lorraine.

01:37:33.511 --> 01:37:36.378
You wanna teach me about respect?
Who respects you?

01:37:36.447 --> 01:37:41.146
The wife who's smart enough to get rid
of you, or the kids you never fucking see?

01:37:42.487 --> 01:37:44.682
What did I tell you about her?

01:37:46.290 --> 01:37:48.224
Oh, God!

01:38:45.116 --> 01:38:47.607
You know, I know what y'all think of me.

01:38:48.786 --> 01:38:51.914
- School just seemed like a waste of time.
- It's not.

01:38:53.157 --> 01:38:56.593
I know that.
I'm not some dumb kid, you know.

01:38:57.462 --> 01:39:00.158
I wanna be normal. It's just not my life.

01:39:01.098 --> 01:39:03.430
What is your life? What do you want?

01:39:04.769 --> 01:39:06.737
If I could do anything?

01:39:10.541 --> 01:39:12.236
Promise you won't laugh?

01:39:13.377 --> 01:39:15.140
I don't know if I can promise.

01:39:15.213 --> 01:39:19.013
Well, I thought about maybe working
in a hospital or something...

01:39:19.183 --> 01:39:22.209
like being an x-ray technician
or something like that.

01:39:23.221 --> 01:39:24.210
Okay.

01:39:25.323 --> 01:39:27.917
- Can I ask why?
- I don't know.

01:39:30.094 --> 01:39:32.688
I like the way bones look on a light box.

01:39:32.763 --> 01:39:36.062
They're like portraits, but on the inside.

01:39:37.935 --> 01:39:40.563
I know it does sound totally stupid.

01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:43.704
No, it's not stupid.

01:39:55.953 --> 01:39:57.045
Hello?

01:39:58.289 --> 01:40:01.281
Hello? Is anyone there?

01:40:21.712 --> 01:40:23.202
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:25.977
I keep forgetting
there's a woman in the house.

01:41:12.663 --> 01:41:14.130
Any sign of him?

01:41:14.198 --> 01:41:16.826
Listen, Pursey, I need to tell you something.

01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:20.660
What, you worried about him?

01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:27.439
What are you doing today?

01:41:28.045 --> 01:41:30.172
I thought I'd go down to the Quarter...

01:41:30.247 --> 01:41:32.772
Iook for a job. I haven't tried there yet.

01:41:33.584 --> 01:41:35.984
Want someone to show you around?

01:41:51.002 --> 01:41:53.869
- Give us a call next week.
- All right, thanks.

01:41:55.473 --> 01:41:56.667
Well?

01:41:57.675 --> 01:42:00.610
Maybe, but only part-time.

01:42:01.112 --> 01:42:04.240
It's not like you have rent.
You don't have to work full-time.

01:42:04.315 --> 01:42:08.012
I need to get away
from Bobby full-time. Overtime.

01:42:08.619 --> 01:42:12.350
Maybe I could help you get started
on those bone portraits.

01:42:12.523 --> 01:42:14.514
You can get your GED, you know.

01:42:14.859 --> 01:42:17.419
Sure I can. Then maybe I can go to Harvard.

01:42:18.329 --> 01:42:19.455
Maybe.

01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:34.778
You know, you eat like shit?

01:42:35.379 --> 01:42:36.846
You drink too much.

01:42:37.915 --> 01:42:38.904
Okay.

01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:41.543
Would you let me read your book sometime?

01:42:41.619 --> 01:42:43.712
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

01:42:43.854 --> 01:42:47.813
- Most of it ends up in the trash.
- How long you been writing it?

01:42:48.259 --> 01:42:50.386
Too long, and not long enough.

01:42:50.928 --> 01:42:54.329
- Did you graduate from college?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

01:42:54.398 --> 01:42:58.061
With the privilege of becoming
Bobby Long's teaching assistant.

01:42:59.303 --> 01:43:01.737
Why did y'all leave that school?

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.505
It's complicated. So many reasons.

01:43:08.379 --> 01:43:09.539
Tell me one.

01:43:12.483 --> 01:43:14.610
A lot happened real fast...

01:43:15.753 --> 01:43:17.550
and New Orleans, all this...

01:43:18.155 --> 01:43:20.521
it sort of seemed romantic at the time.

01:43:21.959 --> 01:43:23.153
Is it?

01:43:24.395 --> 01:43:25.953
Is it romantic?

01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:32.464
It has its moments.

01:43:38.142 --> 01:43:40.337
Would you really help me get my GED?

01:43:41.245 --> 01:43:42.735
Yes, I really would.

01:43:44.014 --> 01:43:45.709
- Why?
- Why not?

01:43:46.083 --> 01:43:48.074
Don't have anything else to do.

01:43:48.619 --> 01:43:50.917
Would you quit drinking so much?

01:43:52.289 --> 01:43:53.278
Why?

01:43:54.625 --> 01:43:57.492
Why not?
You don't have anything else to do.

01:44:02.533 --> 01:44:03.795
All right.

01:44:05.636 --> 01:44:06.967
All right.

01:44:28.092 --> 01:44:30.560
So, where is he, the son of a bitch?

01:44:31.395 --> 01:44:35.764
Probably on some barstool somewhere,
whining about how misunderstood he is.

01:44:35.966 --> 01:44:39.697
You've better things to do than waste
another day worrying about Bobby Long.

01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:42.830
He didn't. We had a nice day, didn't we?

01:44:45.009 --> 01:44:45.998
Yeah.

01:44:51.682 --> 01:44:54.173
Come on, darling, we better get home.

01:44:55.219 --> 01:44:56.777
See you at home.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:06.086
It must be getting pretty crowded for you,
only two rooms.

01:45:06.163 --> 01:45:09.291
What about your work, sugar?
There's no privacy there.

01:45:09.366 --> 01:45:11.459
You could stay at my place.

01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:15.337
Will you think about it?

01:45:24.849 --> 01:45:26.111
I'm back.

01:45:28.519 --> 01:45:30.510
Aren't you people glad to see me?

01:45:30.588 --> 01:45:32.579
- No.
- You might have called.

01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:35.984
Well, then ask me. Say:

01:45:36.327 --> 01:45:38.761
"Bobby, what have you brought me?"

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.060
Biloxi?

01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:48.097
Video poker or nickel slots?

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.538
- Man, where's my car?
- I sold it.

01:45:51.609 --> 01:45:54.908
Now, Pursey, go put some music on.
We're gonna celebrate.

01:45:57.348 --> 01:46:00.317
- You what?
- I sold it. We didn't need a car.

01:46:00.784 --> 01:46:04.379
This is a single malt. When was the last time
you had a single malt?

01:46:04.455 --> 01:46:06.480
- For how much?
- $300.

01:46:06.557 --> 01:46:09.720
You fucking sold my car for fucking $300?

01:46:09.793 --> 01:46:11.624
Have you lost
your goddamn mind completely?

01:46:11.695 --> 01:46:13.219
Just hold that punch.

01:46:13.497 --> 01:46:15.055
Now, you remember...

01:46:15.766 --> 01:46:17.597
I have a broken face.

01:46:18.569 --> 01:46:21.470
Now, I didn't have any money.

01:46:23.107 --> 01:46:25.575
That's because your check is here.

01:46:25.676 --> 01:46:29.339
And this, too. From the lawyer.
It's time to tell her.

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.077
I waited for you to get the...
What the fuck are you doing?

01:46:33.150 --> 01:46:37.109
You give me five minutes,
and then you do what you think is right.

01:46:41.058 --> 01:46:43.925
Well, look how nice
you changed everything.

01:46:45.729 --> 01:46:50.462
I'd have destroyed that TV weeks ago
if I'd known it would drive you to Steinbeck.

01:46:50.801 --> 01:46:53.361
All right, now, I have something to tell y'all.

01:46:53.437 --> 01:46:55.098
Come on in, sit down.

01:46:56.807 --> 01:46:58.331
Come on, man, sit...

01:46:58.842 --> 01:47:02.369
Will you stop grieving
about that hunk of shit and sit down?

01:47:02.446 --> 01:47:03.708
I'll stand.

01:47:04.581 --> 01:47:06.378
All right, close your eyes.

01:47:08.385 --> 01:47:11.081
- Close your eyes, man.
- I'm not closing my goddamn eyes.

01:47:11.155 --> 01:47:12.952
Come on, Lawson. Christ.

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.522
All right, now.

01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:21.821
You can open them now, darling.

01:47:22.733 --> 01:47:24.860
Courtesy of a lovely teacher...

01:47:24.969 --> 01:47:28.871
whose heart once found Bobby Long
cause enough to skip a beat or two.

01:47:28.939 --> 01:47:32.466
"To certify that Purslane Hominy Will...

01:47:32.609 --> 01:47:35.476
"has successfully completed
the 11th grade...

01:47:35.546 --> 01:47:38.310
"and is recommended to the 12th grade."

01:47:38.949 --> 01:47:41.577
"Why stay we on earth except to grow?"

01:47:49.259 --> 01:47:50.624
Robert Browning.

01:47:50.694 --> 01:47:53.720
He's definitely your run-of-the-mill
senior-year poet.

01:47:54.698 --> 01:47:56.825
Is this really your idea of an apology...

01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.835
or are you just trying to one-up
his GED offer?

01:48:01.472 --> 01:48:02.871
Great minds.

01:48:08.746 --> 01:48:10.873
Come on, man.
Of course she takes a language.

01:48:10.948 --> 01:48:13.439
- You want to speak French, don't you?
- Don't be an ass.

01:48:13.517 --> 01:48:16.486
You know that
she can't take French 1 as a senior.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:17.746
All right.

01:48:18.188 --> 01:48:22.557
So we got English Lit, European History,
Geography, Psychology.

01:48:22.626 --> 01:48:24.218
We need one more.

01:48:24.762 --> 01:48:27.196
- I think Art Appreciation.
- Music.

01:48:27.264 --> 01:48:29.732
- I think she'd like music.
- I'm not going.

01:48:33.504 --> 01:48:35.938
Well, God damn, it's already set up.

01:48:36.006 --> 01:48:39.169
Do you know how much I had to go through
for you for this?

01:48:39.243 --> 01:48:42.804
For me? You expect me to...
Come on. What's in it for you?

01:48:43.914 --> 01:48:46.974
Firstly, it'll get you out of the house,
for my sanity.

01:48:47.051 --> 01:48:49.747
- That's what I thought.
- No, look.

01:48:50.054 --> 01:48:52.784
You said something to me recently.
It got me thinking.

01:48:52.856 --> 01:48:54.983
You said, "I'm just a girl."

01:48:55.726 --> 01:48:59.787
Maybe I've grown too calloused
over the years, but you are just a girl.

01:49:00.497 --> 01:49:04.524
Not unlike the students
that flowed through my classes years ago.

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:08.798
And I know that
we must seem horrible to you...

01:49:08.872 --> 01:49:12.330
but we still got something to offer. We must.

01:49:14.978 --> 01:49:18.243
And besides,
I think we owe it to your mother.

01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:22.377
And as hard is it is to believe...

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:26.256
we, too, once were innocent children.

01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:28.290
You are such a shameless ham.

01:49:29.193 --> 01:49:31.457
What makes you think I could do this?

01:49:32.696 --> 01:49:34.960
Because we know God, and God knows us.

01:49:35.532 --> 01:49:38.365
And he and Lorraine brought you here
for a reason.

01:49:39.570 --> 01:49:41.197
School starts in a month.

01:49:41.271 --> 01:49:43.671
You can give us a chance. It might be fun.

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.571
"Fun" is a stretch, don't you think?

01:49:45.642 --> 01:49:49.009
Listen, sweetheart,
that's one of your mama's songs.

01:49:50.547 --> 01:49:52.208
That's beautiful.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.015
She'd be so proud.

01:50:48.672 --> 01:50:50.765
What do you think of my face?

01:50:53.043 --> 01:50:55.534
See this bone? It's broken.

01:50:55.779 --> 01:50:57.406
But you can move it.

01:51:00.651 --> 01:51:02.346
How'd that happen?

01:51:03.253 --> 01:51:06.347
"Never fight fair with a stranger."
Arthur Miller.

01:51:06.523 --> 01:51:09.014
That happened in a fight? You lost?

01:51:10.494 --> 01:51:12.860
Well, I lost a lot more than the fight.

01:51:15.165 --> 01:51:18.464
Does it take away from my appearance,
in your opinion, miss?

01:51:19.503 --> 01:51:21.630
I think you're still handsome.

01:51:21.905 --> 01:51:24.601
Well, aren't y'all sweet?

01:51:26.643 --> 01:51:29.544
Are you having sexual intercourse
with one another?

01:51:31.815 --> 01:51:35.046
- Okay, Dr. Ruth, let's go.
- It's all right if you are.

01:51:35.319 --> 01:51:36.718
Sex is nice.

01:51:37.321 --> 01:51:39.721
Just remember to be kind to one another.

01:51:39.823 --> 01:51:43.782
And stay young as long as you can.
Your youth is fleeting. Be kind.

01:51:45.162 --> 01:51:46.959
We should start with memorization.

01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:49.430
I think we should stick to
the Socratic method.

01:51:49.499 --> 01:51:52.991
You do? Just exactly who is Plato
and who is Socrates...

01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:55.265
in this arrangement?
Because I'll just stay out.

01:51:55.339 --> 01:51:57.307
You are Socrates, of course.

01:51:57.374 --> 01:51:59.865
- You are the Teacher.
- You're goddamn right I am.

01:51:59.943 --> 01:52:01.570
I wish y'all would just shut up...

01:52:01.645 --> 01:52:04.637
because if it's gonna be like this,
I ain't learning nothing.

01:52:04.715 --> 01:52:07.445
Girl, your English is fucking atrocious.

01:52:08.652 --> 01:52:10.552
Purslane Hominy, sit up.

01:52:10.887 --> 01:52:12.616
Why can't I study in bed?

01:52:12.723 --> 01:52:15.055
It's so hot,
and this chair is so uncomfortable.

01:52:15.125 --> 01:52:18.720
It is not supposed to be comfortable.
It'll put your brain to sleep. Sit up.

01:52:18.795 --> 01:52:21.923
- It's just bad habits.
- You're talking to me about bad habits?

01:52:21.999 --> 01:52:24.661
Don't fuck with the Teacher, okay?

01:52:25.235 --> 01:52:29.228
Just tell me what is Nebraska's role
in American Literature? Go.

01:52:29.306 --> 01:52:33.504
- Shouldn't I be learning the state capitals?
- Bullshit. You'll learn what matters.

01:52:33.577 --> 01:52:36.205
- Don't procrastinate.
- By whatever do you mean?

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.942
I don't have a card for procrastinate.

01:52:39.016 --> 01:52:41.314
You are just incorrigible.

01:52:48.225 --> 01:52:49.487
"Procrastinate.

01:52:49.726 --> 01:52:52.217
"To drag one's ass
in such a pathetic manner...

01:52:52.296 --> 01:52:55.231
"as to ensure one's place in life as a loser."

01:52:55.299 --> 01:52:57.597
Hey, who are you calling a loser?

01:52:58.969 --> 01:53:00.266
- Fuck.
- Go.

01:53:00.837 --> 01:53:02.771
All right, Nebraska.

01:53:02.873 --> 01:53:06.434
Home state of Willa Cather,
one of our first successful female authors.

01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:09.206
Or should I move east to Missouri,
where Mark Twain...

01:53:09.279 --> 01:53:11.941
alias Samuel Clemens, was born,
or down south to Kansas...

01:53:12.015 --> 01:53:14.142
where William Burroughs
spent his last years?

01:53:14.217 --> 01:53:16.651
- Stop!
- Hey, man...

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:19.450
I don't think they'll teach Burroughs
at Catholic school.

01:53:19.523 --> 01:53:21.013
Well, they ought to.

01:53:35.572 --> 01:53:38.063
Why don't you pour your old buddy a drink?

01:53:38.175 --> 01:53:41.508
- We're out of juice.
- Well, what's in that glass?

01:53:42.579 --> 01:53:44.240
It doesn't have a smell.

01:53:44.314 --> 01:53:47.374
Well, God damn it,
pour some vodka in it then.

01:53:49.486 --> 01:53:51.716
- Go ahead.
- We gotta quit.

01:53:51.988 --> 01:53:56.118
I promised Pursey if she'd study.
I mean, look at us. We're worthless.

01:53:57.361 --> 01:53:59.921
And when was that, that you quit?

01:54:00.864 --> 01:54:03.731
Nineteen hours ago, when we were quizzing.

01:54:07.104 --> 01:54:10.073
- Did you get some sleep?
- No.

01:54:13.543 --> 01:54:16.944
There's no rush for her or for us...

01:54:17.647 --> 01:54:21.014
so if you want to quit, take it slow.

01:54:21.852 --> 01:54:23.410
Now, trust me on this.

01:54:23.787 --> 01:54:26.347
Take away the bottle, take away the genie.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.380
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:55:28.185 --> 01:55:30.915
I just thought I'd give Lawson a break.

01:55:31.188 --> 01:55:33.679
Let him use the bedroom.
Come on, sit down.

01:55:41.131 --> 01:55:43.497
You look very pretty today, Purslane.

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:47.063
No one calls me that
but my dead grandmother, but thanks.

01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:49.531
Now, you remember how to get there?

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:53.601
I know where it is all right,
so I guess I should be going.

01:55:55.245 --> 01:55:56.439
You nervous?

01:55:57.414 --> 01:55:58.403
No.

01:56:01.051 --> 01:56:02.143
Yeah.

01:56:03.887 --> 01:56:06.253
Want me to take the streetcar with you?

01:56:06.923 --> 01:56:08.550
No, I'll be okay.

01:56:11.495 --> 01:56:13.895
Well, I know you'll just do fine.

01:56:14.364 --> 01:56:17.128
And we'll be right here
when you get back from school...

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.997
to help you with your homework.

01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:21.697
Christ, you're really living
in some parallel universe.

01:56:21.771 --> 01:56:24.035
Me and "homework" in the same sentence.

01:56:32.048 --> 01:56:35.950
It's about to become you and "tardy"
in the same sentence, so...

01:56:52.102 --> 01:56:53.694
Think she'll come right home?

01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:56.432
Where else would a teenage girl go
but straight home...

01:56:56.506 --> 01:56:58.872
to her endlessly entertaining
middle-aged roommates?

01:56:58.942 --> 01:57:02.503
She's no picnic.
Tortures me with that noise.

01:57:03.747 --> 01:57:07.342
That child should know
anything worth listening to is on vinyl.

01:57:08.118 --> 01:57:09.449
My kids knew it.

01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.453
I taught them. I was their father.

01:57:15.425 --> 01:57:16.653
You still are.

01:57:21.731 --> 01:57:25.531
One day they'll understand,
when you finish that book.

01:57:29.539 --> 01:57:31.370
My kids don't even know me.

01:57:32.576 --> 01:57:34.806
Shit, can we do anything besides this?

01:57:34.878 --> 01:57:36.812
- Like what?
- Fuck if I know.

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.872
- We could go fishing.
- You don't fish.

01:57:41.484 --> 01:57:43.111
Maybe I should start...

01:57:45.021 --> 01:57:46.352
something.

01:57:46.423 --> 01:57:49.221
Maybe you should start working
on your damn book.

01:57:51.361 --> 01:57:53.727
I don't know the end of the story yet.

01:57:54.464 --> 01:57:57.490
Checkmate. Let's get out of here.
We're depressing me.

01:58:01.738 --> 01:58:03.706
You know, I wanna say something...

01:58:03.773 --> 01:58:07.470
about life, because an unexamined life...

01:58:07.544 --> 01:58:10.638
- is simply a life...
- Not worth living.

01:58:11.281 --> 01:58:13.806
Purslane, our prodigy has returned.

01:58:13.883 --> 01:58:15.908
Now, tell us everything.

01:58:18.054 --> 01:58:20.852
Honey, why did you leave school early?

01:58:24.127 --> 01:58:25.788
I didn't belong there.

01:58:25.862 --> 01:58:29.798
I appreciate what y'all are doing,
but I'm not going back.

01:58:30.166 --> 01:58:31.292
What?

01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:33.598
I really need a job.

01:58:36.306 --> 01:58:39.798
- You can work here on the weekends, sugar.
- Really?

01:58:40.777 --> 01:58:44.543
- Only if you're in school, though.
- Good one, Earl.

01:58:59.562 --> 01:59:02.463
Autumn comes slowly in New Orleans.

01:59:03.466 --> 01:59:05.661
The grass remains a stubborn green...

01:59:05.735 --> 01:59:08.295
but the heat gives way to a gentle warmth.

01:59:09.239 --> 01:59:11.935
Pursey did begin to catch on in school.

01:59:12.509 --> 01:59:15.672
She was surprised. We weren't.

01:59:18.248 --> 01:59:22.082
Winter arrived before we realized
the sunlit hours of summer had waned.

01:59:28.158 --> 01:59:30.683
Somehow, the wine began
to outlast the day...

01:59:34.531 --> 01:59:37.398
and that was more than
anyone could have asked for.

01:59:47.210 --> 01:59:51.237
Someone should have told them Creoles we
got something called winter in Louisiana.

01:59:51.314 --> 01:59:53.509
We might have improved
on their oversight...

01:59:53.583 --> 01:59:56.051
with this cool new invention called heat.

01:59:56.286 --> 01:59:59.278
- Pursey, where'd you put the vodka?
- You told me to hide it.

01:59:59.355 --> 02:00:01.846
I did. But where did you hide it?

02:00:02.058 --> 02:00:04.117
I'm not supposed to tell you, remember?

02:00:04.194 --> 02:00:06.754
You don't do anything else I tell you to do.
Where is it?

02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:10.732
Lawson, Bobby's trying to get me
to tell him where the vodka is again.

02:00:11.901 --> 02:00:15.667
- It is Christmas.
- Whatever. It's under the back stairs.

02:00:16.873 --> 02:00:20.104
And I could have sworn
it was your turn to do the laundry.

02:00:20.176 --> 02:00:22.667
Don't forget to use the cuddly bear stuff.

02:00:51.541 --> 02:00:53.634
But you aren't a virgin, are you?

02:00:54.544 --> 02:00:57.342
You know, some people would call you
a disgusting old man...

02:00:57.413 --> 02:00:59.108
for your constant sexual harassment.

02:00:59.182 --> 02:01:02.640
I believe the term is "dirty old man,"
not "disgusting."

02:01:03.119 --> 02:01:06.088
And you are a young, blooming bud.

02:01:06.356 --> 02:01:10.053
- Let me live vicariously. You aren't, are you?
- Are you?

02:01:10.627 --> 02:01:12.219
Well, I have children.

02:01:13.096 --> 02:01:14.927
Why don't you ever see them?

02:01:15.198 --> 02:01:18.964
Well, that's a good question.
But you haven't answered mine.

02:01:19.269 --> 02:01:22.397
You know, I'm trying to be serious for once,
Bobby. God.

02:01:27.043 --> 02:01:30.535
The truth is, I wish I could see them.
I miss them like hell.

02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:36.885
It seems to me
if someone wanted to see their kids...

02:01:36.953 --> 02:01:40.354
then they damn well would,
unless they didn't give a shit.
