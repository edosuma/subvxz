According to Netflix,
last night I watched

all the "Insidious"es-es.

just sleep-watched them.

Max, you hacked into
my accounts?

That's illegal!

00:36.437 --> 00:39.505
And beyond what I thought you
were intellectually capable of!

00:40.940 --> 00:45.911
Not much of a hack when
the password is "Hanstoppable."

00:45.913 --> 00:48.013
That's a breach
of trust, girls.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.815

about that hideous uniform.

I'm afraid only
one guest RSVP'd "yes."

09:15.422 --> 09:19.224
All the rest of her
friends RSVP'd "dead."

09:19.226 --> 09:20.825
Bernard, I really do wish
I could give

but I don't have the money

09:23.030 --> 09:24.596

09:24.598 --> 09:27.365
Or even real milk,
for that matter.

much more disappointment.

Bruce Jenner.

Max, I have to give her
the one thing that she wants.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.993

on civil rights?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.394
No, the luncheon.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.196
She deserves one last hurrah

she's lost everything.

had done that for me

came crashing down.

Okay, I'll help you.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.706
I mean, Maria will,
if she can find a babysitter.

You are the only person
I'll wear this for.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.322
You know, without
the $300 up front.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.859
Thank God Sophie
had that maid outfit.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.661
I think this is gonna work.

10:33.065 --> 10:36.234
As long as you don't
turn around.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.236

Caroline, is that you?

10:38.238 --> 10:39.638
Oh, she's coming.
Quick.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.906
Behind the screen.
Put the suit on over that.

10:41.908 --> 10:45.276
You want me to change into a
Chanel suit behind this screen?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.946
Oh, there's room.
I've done it numerous times.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.349
Oh, did the rest of
our staff arrive yet?

10:51.351 --> 10:53.418
Yes, if you can call them that.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.286
Where did you find them anyway?

10:55.288 --> 10:57.922
Um, around.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.526
Just push me into the room!

11:04.997 --> 11:07.165
I'm doing
the best I can!

11:07.167 --> 11:10.201
These pants are
five sizes too big!

11:10.203 --> 11:14.606
Bernard, next time,
don't hire a child butler.

11:14.608 --> 11:19.177
And you, don't they have
wheelchairs in China?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.046
I'm from Korea!

11:21.048 --> 11:23.548
I don't think so.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.520
Tell Caroline she owes me.

11:28.522 --> 11:32.323
Who knows what STD I'm catching
from Oleg's butler costume?

11:33.726 --> 11:35.593
And why does
he even have this?

11:35.595 --> 11:39.531
It's from when they play
"Going Downtown Abbey."

11:39.533 --> 11:43.268
Maria, I need help
with my hair.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.403
See what you can do.

11:45.405 --> 11:49.507
Um, no, I'm not
really good at that.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.910
Maria, just do it.
Go.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.514
Okay.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.417
You get one of those,
and that was it.

12:01.020 --> 12:05.623
Oh, there's my girl.
You look wonderful.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.094
I forgot how good Chanel
feels against my skin.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.562
It's like coming home,

12:10.564 --> 12:13.465
but the house
is made of silk and hope.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.667
How's this?
A little too Princess Leia?

12:18.471 --> 12:22.373
On top!
I like it up on top.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.942
Whoa!

12:30.750 --> 12:32.751
Whoa, Grammy.
Keep it PG.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.619
[elevator dings]

12:39.925 --> 12:41.493
Where am I?

12:43.295 --> 12:45.497
Oh, it's Gertrude Goolsby.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.999
Your first and only
guest has arrived.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.268
Astrid! Oh!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.003
Oh, have to--oh.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.473
Sneaks up on you.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.145
Good luck with all this.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.982
I'll be in the kitchen,
studying the Chipotle menu.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.717
For my next job.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.921
Don't you look smashing, Astrid.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.857
I'm assuming.
I can't see anymore.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.827
Well, I bet
you and Grammy have

13:15.829 --> 13:18.897
a lot of fun stuff
to catch up on.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.465
How is Gordon?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.400
He has face cancer.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.839
Or the weather
is also a subject.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.675
We'd like the first course,
pronto.

13:30.677 --> 13:33.678
Maria!
Look alive.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.214
You're one to talk.

13:36.216 --> 13:39.584
[bell dinging]

13:39.586 --> 13:41.986
And she gets one of those
and that was it.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.624
Dear, may I ask you
a question?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.427
Where am I?

13:50.996 --> 13:54.465
Oh, and where
is our sommelier?

13:54.467 --> 13:57.502
At your service.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.972
Some wine?

14:02.942 --> 14:05.376
Um...

14:05.378 --> 14:09.047
My bad.
This one's empty.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.149
I got bored.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.987
And what about you, ma'am?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.121
White, red,

14:17.123 --> 14:19.891
or maybe you prefer
a chocolate brown?

14:22.328 --> 14:24.062
I must be in New Orleans.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.899
Here we go.

14:27.901 --> 14:31.269
It's from
the Bordeaux region.

14:31.271 --> 14:34.038
More like the Costco region.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.076
Maria!

14:38.078 --> 14:40.278
That's me.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.983
Why are these forks
not laid out correctly?

14:44.985 --> 14:48.052
Maria, forks, now.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.320
Glad you like that outfit,

14:49.322 --> 14:52.757
'cause you're gonna
be buried in it.

14:52.759 --> 14:56.194
I think I'm gonna let this one
breathe in the kitchen.

14:58.864 --> 15:01.466
Caroline, I'd like
to meet the chef.

15:01.468 --> 15:04.869
Oh, of course.
Chef!

15:04.871 --> 15:07.005
Booyah!

15:07.007 --> 15:08.673
I'm Chef Oleg.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.343
Gordon Ramsay once put
me in a headlock.

15:12.345 --> 15:17.582
Please enjoy the first course
of my first course:

15:17.584 --> 15:19.918
a tasty tortellini.

15:21.453 --> 15:26.157
Caroline, this sauce
is delicious!

15:26.159 --> 15:28.092
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.994
This is the kind of luncheon
that makes you feel

15:29.996 --> 15:34.165
like you can handle
anything that comes along.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.534
Pity there aren't
more guests to enjoy it.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.503
[elevator dings]

15:38.505 --> 15:40.271
[posh accent]
Darling!

15:47.980 --> 15:51.582
Well, I hope I'm not late
for the luncheon!

15:56.555 --> 15:58.690
Mmm!

15:58.692 --> 16:01.192
[posh accent]
This crème brûlée
is just divine!

16:03.495 --> 16:06.164
Don't mind
if I don't mind.

16:09.001 --> 16:13.571
[normal voice]
Uh, excuse me.
I have to tinkle.

16:13.573 --> 16:16.240
Where's your john?

16:16.242 --> 16:18.109
Oh, I forgot!

16:18.111 --> 16:19.110
Yes, um...

16:19.112 --> 16:22.180
[posh accent]
Pardon me, yes.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.583
Could you direct me to your...

16:25.585 --> 16:27.285
Jonathan?

16:34.727 --> 16:36.394
Astrid, darling,

16:36.396 --> 16:39.831
I wasn't sure what to expect
from one of your lunches,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.933
you know, since the scandal,

16:41.935 --> 16:43.568
since you lost all of your--

16:43.570 --> 16:45.203
Gah!

16:46.705 --> 16:48.072
I mean, uh...

16:48.074 --> 16:50.508
Lunch is over.
Gertrude is leaving.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.810
Scandal? What scandal?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.379
Oh, you know.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.781
The horror of
you not having any more--

16:56.783 --> 16:58.916
Mayday!
Double dingle!

16:58.918 --> 17:00.451
Maria, do something.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.986
(Gertrude)
Oh.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.088
So you mean she doesn't
want to talk about the fact

17:04.090 --> 17:05.623
that she's lost all her mon--

17:05.625 --> 17:06.858
[glass shatters]

17:09.228 --> 17:11.062
Oh, it's crystal
that broke.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.431
I thought it was
one of Astrid's bones.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.168
I'll replace it.
I mean, I can't,

17:17.170 --> 17:20.004
but it's the right thing
to say right now.

17:20.006 --> 17:23.174
Maria,
that's my good crystal.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.944
And it's not replaceable,
unlike you.

17:26.946 --> 17:29.213
- Now go!
- Fine.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.017
I'll go.
To wherever Maria lives.

17:35.521 --> 17:36.954
But just know your granddaughter

17:36.956 --> 17:39.891
worked really hard
to make this lunch all nice.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.426
No, you don't
have to go.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.428
Oh, can I go?

17:46.598 --> 17:47.765
Maybe I should go too.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.802
Would anyone buy
that I had plans?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.370
No one is going.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.405
I'm just gonna
pick up the broken crystal

17:54.407 --> 17:58.076
and we'll just continue to
have the best luncheon ever.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.244
Caroline!
Let the help do that.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.713
Get up off of that floor!

18:02.715 --> 18:04.482
You are not one of them.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.288
Actually, yes, I am.

18:11.323 --> 18:12.924
Grammy, you may have
been in a coma,

18:12.926 --> 18:15.993
but I feel like it's me
that just woke up.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.295
For the past five years,

18:17.297 --> 18:20.932
I have been really missing
all of this,

18:20.934 --> 18:23.901
but it's not good crystal
that makes a life.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.972
It's good people.
People like them.

18:27.974 --> 18:31.476
And they are not "the help,"

18:31.478 --> 18:34.145
but they did
come here to help me.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.446
'Cause you and I
might be related,

18:35.448 --> 18:39.183
but these people
are my family now.

18:39.185 --> 18:42.587
And also, I should tell you,

18:42.589 --> 18:45.490
I don't work on Wall Street.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.060
I work in Brooklyn,
in a diner.

18:49.062 --> 18:52.029
See?
I'm a waitress.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.898
That's debatable.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.638
I don't understand.

19:00.640 --> 19:05.810
You're a Channing.
How could you be a waitress?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.446
Because she lost all her money

19:08.448 --> 19:12.283
when you lost all
your money.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.552
[heart monitor beats faster]

19:14.554 --> 19:17.488
- Caroline, what is she saying?
- Nothing, she's saying nothing.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
I'm saying,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.893
you're poor.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.394
[heart monitor beats increase]

19:23.396 --> 19:25.696
[gasping]

19:25.698 --> 19:29.133
[heart monitor flatlines]

19:29.135 --> 19:31.335
Oh, I leave for two minutes

19:31.337 --> 19:34.438
and the party really
goes downhill!

19:43.382 --> 19:45.983
I'm sorry again about
your grandma, darlin'.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.318
Thanks, Earl.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.487
Well, she did die
doing what she loved:

19:49.489 --> 19:51.722
being rich and
yelling at the help.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.993
[crying]

19:55.995 --> 20:00.298
I'm gonna miss her so much!

20:00.300 --> 20:03.868
Sophie, you knew her
for three courses.

20:03.870 --> 20:08.239
I know; I didn't win that Polish
daytime Emmy for nothing!

20:10.609 --> 20:13.010
You know, Caroline,
you did the right thing

20:13.012 --> 20:14.178
throwing that luncheon.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.613
And I pulled a glute

20:15.615 --> 20:19.417
pushing your lovely
racist grandmother around.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.620
I really appreciate you guys
helping me with the luncheon.

20:22.622 --> 20:26.290
And, Oleg, I tried the food,
and it wasn't gross.

20:26.292 --> 20:30.228
You hear that, Han?
Wasn't. Gross.

20:31.496 --> 20:33.497
After being a servant
for a few hours,

20:33.499 --> 20:36.000
I get how much you all
have to put up with.

20:36.002 --> 20:39.136
So, I'm giving
you all a raise!

20:39.138 --> 20:41.839
Thank you so much, Han!

20:41.841 --> 20:43.074
Everyone?

20:43.076 --> 20:46.177
They don't need
drug money for a baby.

20:46.179 --> 20:49.580
No, but we need drug money
for a 27-year-old woman.
