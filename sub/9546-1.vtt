your name again?

00:08.141 --> 00:09.009
(Jack)
Uh, Jack.
Jack.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.778
(Jack)
You live here alone?

00:10.811 --> 00:11.778
(Michelle)
Not tonight I don't.

00:11.811 --> 00:21.189
Come on over here.
[laughing]

00:21.222 --> 00:22.623
What is this stuff?

00:22.655 --> 00:24.158
What stuff?

00:24.192 --> 00:25.559
This stuff in your hair.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.460
Oh, it's glitter.
Fairy dust.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.495
Oh.

00:28.528 --> 00:32.299
Why don't you
make yourself useful,

00:32.332 --> 00:34.234
and open the bed?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.668
Where's the bed?
You're sitting on it.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.438
Right.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.140
The bed.

[shirt rips]

00:43.877 --> 00:46.414
Oh, man.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.281
Great.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.582
I ripped--my wife
gave me this shirt.

00:49.616 --> 00:52.453
Oh, your wife
gave you this shirt?

00:52.485 --> 00:53.587
Yeah.

00:53.621 --> 00:57.691
Oh, your marriage
really is in trouble.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.460
[laughing]
Shut up!

00:59.493 --> 01:01.462
Oh!
[gasps]

01:01.494 --> 01:02.429
Shut up.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.564
Whoa!
Oh, yeah, whoa.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.233
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:12.439 --> 01:13.873
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:13.906 --> 01:15.376
No-no-no-no.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.409
Uh, don't worry.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.478
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
What the--

01:17.510 --> 01:19.712
Is that a camera?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.713
You setting me up?

01:20.748 --> 01:21.715
What are you talking about?

01:21.748 --> 01:23.183
Is this what you do?

01:23.216 --> 01:24.317
You go out
and you pick up married guys,

01:24.352 --> 01:25.319
you bring 'em back here,

01:25.353 --> 01:26.387
and you shake 'em down?

01:26.420 --> 01:27.555
Give me the god damned
camera!

01:27.587 --> 01:30.390
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

01:32.560 --> 01:33.826
Give me the camera.

01:33.860 --> 01:34.895
Give it to me!

01:34.927 --> 01:37.664
Ugh!

02:11.598 --> 02:13.401
* Well, I do

Adrian, I just don't know
what to say.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.248
I'm speechless,
and I'm very very proud of you.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.550
No big deal.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.318
No-no-no.
I'm very, very proud of you.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.885
And it is a big deal.

03:05.919 --> 03:06.954
It's just one weekend.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.289
I'll be gone
for two nights.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.557
Two nights alone
in a hotel?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.692
I might even
leave my room.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.894
Yes.

03:13.926 --> 03:14.895
Would you like
to come along?

03:14.927 --> 03:16.296
I'll treat.
No.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.698
No, I mean
it's your vacation.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.799
My treat.

03:18.831 --> 03:20.268
But it's your breakthrough.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.602
And I think
it's the first time

03:21.634 --> 03:23.937
since you lost Trudy
that you're actually

03:23.971 --> 03:24.972
looking forward to something.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.939
I am.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.575
I'm looking forward.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.677
You know, there is
a term for this, Adrian.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.645
It's called
affirmative reflex.

03:31.679 --> 03:36.283
And it's
a very, very big step.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.718
Okay, it's 3:00.
I'll see you next--

03:38.752 --> 03:40.653
Okay, I'll see you
on Wednesday.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.521
Whoa, wait-wait-wait.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.656
You know, I was thinking
maybe we should

03:42.689 --> 03:44.991
eliminate Wednesday.

03:45.025 --> 03:48.695
And you can come
on Monday and Friday.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.963
Two days a week?

03:50.997 --> 03:54.602
Yeah, how would you feel
about that?

03:54.634 --> 03:56.569
I don't know what to say.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.307
That's only twice as much
as a normal person.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.040
How many times
has Harold Crenshaw come?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.843
Adrian, you know I can't
talk about another patient.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.044
I'll bet he comes
three times a week.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.680
Loser.

04:06.713 --> 04:07.681
Adrian, it's not a contest.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.816
The important thing is

04:08.848 --> 04:11.551
that you're making
real tangible progress.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.686
And I couldn't be happier.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.489
You know, you've been stuck
at square one

04:15.522 --> 04:17.858
for a long time.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.593
I hate square one.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.728
Well then let me
be the first to say,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.062
welcome to square two.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.533
How many squares are there?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.668
We'll just take it
one step at a time.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.569
What square
is Harold on?

04:28.601 --> 04:29.569
Doesn't matter.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.406
I understand.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.742
He's still on square one,
isn't he?

04:34.774 --> 04:37.043
Blink twice
if I'm right.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.817
Tangible progress,
can you believe it?

04:43.850 --> 04:46.853
That's what he said.
Tangible progress.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.456
Those were his words.
Good for you.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.658
He said that I was
on square two.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.060
That's a good place
to be.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.596
What square are you on?

04:55.629 --> 04:56.697
Oh, I don't know,
Mr. Monk.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.598
I never really
thought about it.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.000
Well, I'd say...

05:01.033 --> 05:05.605
you were on square...

05:05.639 --> 05:07.608
four or five.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.343
That sounds about right.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.711
But you're catching up.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.480
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.547
Are you proud of yourself?

05:13.581 --> 05:14.814
Proud of myself?
No, no.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.915
That's square-five talk.

05:15.949 --> 05:16.949
Work your way
up the street.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.418
Every door, every neighbor.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.387
Report on my desk
by the time you go home.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.389
What's going on?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.423
Homicide upstairs.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.891
No forced entry.

05:23.923 --> 05:27.495
The ME says she's been dead
since midnight.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.663
(Natalie)
Who's that guy?

05:29.697 --> 05:32.432
I can't tell you.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.800
It's a secret.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.370
Captain wants
to tell you himself.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.439
Okay, when the captain
tells you,

05:39.473 --> 05:42.475
you gotta act surprised.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.511
It's a Hollywood producer.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.512
He's making a movie
about us.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.713
I mean all of us.

05:45.745 --> 05:47.014
What kind of movie?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.682
It's called
"The Killer Astronaut."

05:48.716 --> 05:51.451
Remember the jet pilot
Steve Wagner?

05:51.485 --> 05:54.053
Him.
It's great.

05:54.086 --> 05:55.723
There you are!

05:55.755 --> 05:58.725
Hey, are you guys
ready for some great news?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.827
See that guy over there?
He's a television producer.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.663
His name is Hoberman.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.833
They're making a movie
about the astronaut case

06:05.865 --> 06:07.468
from last year.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.737
Hoo!
Ha-ho.

06:09.769 --> 06:10.737
Yah!

06:10.771 --> 06:13.072
Hoo!

06:13.105 --> 06:14.408
You okay?

06:14.442 --> 06:16.543
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.646
Just surprised.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.779
It gets even better.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.113
You know who's sleeping in
that limousine over there?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.115
David Ruskin.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.783
Ooh.
The actor?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.685
He's gonna be playing you.

06:25.718 --> 06:29.622
I know him.
David Ruskin.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.759
I saw him.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.661
Trudy--Trudy and I
saw him in a play.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.096
She thought
he was handsome.

06:37.129 --> 06:38.531
Now he's playing me.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.100
(Stottlemeyer)
Well, I'm glad
you're happy, Monk.

06:40.132 --> 06:43.571
Because the guy
wants to follow you around

06:43.603 --> 06:44.737
for a while.

06:44.771 --> 06:45.773
Follow him?

06:45.805 --> 06:48.074
Yeah, to study him.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.576
It's entirely up to you.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.843
Who's playing me?

06:50.877 --> 06:51.845
Anybody lined up?

06:51.879 --> 06:53.547
Is there any word
from casting?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.582
I don't know, Randy.

06:55.615 --> 06:56.683
I'm thinking Brad Pitt.

06:56.716 --> 06:57.685
I mean,
if it's in the budget.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.752
It's always
about the budget.

07:04.757 --> 07:09.096
Not enough stuffing here.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.230
I think there was
something else

07:10.262 --> 07:13.567
inside this bear.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.906
Could a camera
fit in here?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.807
Sure.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.776
'Cause it was facing
the pull-out couch.

07:23.810 --> 07:27.915
They could have been,
you know...

07:27.947 --> 07:29.882
Makin' whoopee.
Exactly.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.819
His shirt?

07:31.851 --> 07:33.153
(Stottlemeyer)
Yeah, she tore it.

07:33.185 --> 07:35.723
We found blood and skin
under her fingernails.

07:35.755 --> 07:37.790
It must have been
a heavyweight bout in here.

07:37.824 --> 07:38.792
What's out this way?

07:38.826 --> 07:39.826
It's a balcony.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.031
Hey, Captain.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.165
Hey, David.
How you doing, man?

07:46.199 --> 07:48.000
Good.
Welcome.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.168
Thanks.
Is she dead?

07:49.201 --> 07:51.170
(Stottlemeyer)
As a doornail.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.542
Bummer.
Yeah.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.643
So it's cool if I...

07:55.675 --> 07:57.778
(Stottlemeyer)
Absolutely,
make yourself comfortable.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.079
Natalie.
How are you?
Pleasure.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.014
I'm not here,
so just ignore me.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.216
I'm not here.
Is that decaf?

08:04.250 --> 08:06.819
Do you think
I could get one of those?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.156
Where was I?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.958
You were headed out
to the balcony.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.992
Uh, no.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.661
No-no-no-no.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.865
I have to check over here.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.888
There's not enough
stuffing in this bear.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.692
I think there was something
hidden in here.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.893
You already said that.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.162
Did I?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.866
Mr. Monk?
We have a visitor.

08:53.900 --> 08:58.772
Oh.
I-I didn't see you there.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.940
Hey-hey-hey.
Adrian Monk.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.975
Hey.
Uh, Dave Ruskin.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.010
Listen, I am such
a big, big fan of yours.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.979
And I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.346
Normally I would
shake your hand,

09:07.379 --> 09:10.283
but people warned me about,
you know.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.986
No-no, I'm fine.
People exaggerate that stuff.

09:14.020 --> 09:14.988
I can shake hands.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.288
All right, cool.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.692
Well, listen,
I only got a little while

09:19.726 --> 09:20.827
to get inside your head.

09:20.860 --> 09:21.861
So be patient with me.

09:21.894 --> 09:22.863
Well good luck.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.297
[laughing]

09:25.832 --> 09:26.966
What's that for?
What's the matter with you?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.068
Mr. Ruskin?

09:29.101 --> 09:30.703
Huh?
Yeah.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.639
Would you mind?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.741
You want my--no, I'm not--

09:34.774 --> 09:36.076
I'm just an actor.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.211
You want this guy's autograph.
He's the real hero.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.679
Not me.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.780
All right,
all right, all right.

09:42.381 --> 09:43.850
What's your name?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.351
(female cop)
Laura.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.354
Laura.
There you go.

09:47.386 --> 09:49.221
Okay.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.991
All right, so look,
I'm just a fly on the wall.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.927
I'm here to watch
and learn, all right?

09:53.961 --> 09:57.163
You do your magic.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.312
Hi, hey, howdy.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.715
What do you got?

10:19.886 --> 10:22.022
Broken glass.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.759
Could be a piece of
a crystal from a watch.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.759
Bag it.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.761
Bag it!

10:28.796 --> 10:30.831
Thank you.

10:35.769 --> 10:36.736
You okay?

10:36.769 --> 10:39.773
[laughing]

10:39.807 --> 10:41.274
It's just glitter.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.311
It was in her hair.

10:53.385 --> 10:58.091
It won't come off!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.964
What are you doing?
No, no.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.131
Black decaf coffee?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.298
Oh, yeah, cool.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.701
Hi, Mr. Ruskin.
David.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.772
Dave--Davey--Dave.
David Ruskin.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.039
Dave.
Dave's fine.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.073
Dave.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.708
Randy Disher.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.110
Oh, yeah, Lieutenant Disher.
You're in the script.

11:18.144 --> 11:20.080
That's right, that's me.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.350
Hey, you don't happen to know
who's gonna be playing me

11:23.383 --> 11:24.350
in the movie, do you?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.284
I don't know.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.720
The last I heard
they were talking to Brad.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.321
Brad Pitt?
Yeah.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.822
Really?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.192
I swear that's exactly
who I thought.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.226
Excuse me, I gotta
call my mother--

11:34.260 --> 11:35.294
My girlfriend.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.429
[laughing]
Brad Pitt.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.769
Yep.
[laughing]

11:41.802 --> 11:45.038
Thank you.
I enjoyed that.

11:45.072 --> 11:48.508
My pleasure.
My pleasure, Captain.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.809
So...

11:49.842 --> 11:51.177
what do you think?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.511
You think this guy's
gonna strike again?

11:52.544 --> 11:53.913
(Stottlemeyer)
Oh, no, I doubt it.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.514
No, this was a straight-up
crime of passion.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.183
A one-time deal.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.318
This guy will probably
go the rest of his life

11:59.351 --> 12:02.221
and never
cross the line again.

12:06.558 --> 12:10.496
[pounding]

12:39.259 --> 12:40.961
Hey!
Stay right there.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.195
Stay right there.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.130
I'm just gonna go.
Stay right there.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.164
You're not going anywhere.
Relax, I'm just gonna go.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.066
I'm calling the cops.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.267
I'm just gonna leave--

12:47.299 --> 12:48.467
Aaagh!

12:50.102 --> 12:51.971
[gunshot]

13:08.288 --> 13:09.556
What's all this?

13:09.589 --> 13:10.957
Yeah,
I read about this place.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.960
They have artists here
who draw the customers.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.094
On the walls?

13:14.126 --> 13:15.394
What are they,
cave dwellers?

13:15.427 --> 13:17.096
That's why the place
is called Sketches.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.030
You know,
they sketch people.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.332
Natalie, cave dwellers
draw on the walls.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.934
These people are behaving
like cave dwellers.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.403
Okay, they're cave dwellers.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.451
Hey, Monk.
God!

13:38.485 --> 13:41.221
Hey, you
gotta see this.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.222
David Ruskin's
in here.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.490
What's he doing?

13:44.524 --> 13:45.591
He's doing you.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.061
Hey, guys,
can I ask you--

13:48.095 --> 13:50.963
I just wanna ask you
a quick--just a quick question.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.198
I wanna do that thing,
you know,

13:52.231 --> 13:53.066
that he does
with his hands.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.402
Oh, yeah, you know...
No, I can do that.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.970
What is that?
What is that thing?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.337
(Stottlemeyer)
He floats.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.572
It's like he's floating

13:59.605 --> 14:01.474
on the sea of...
Like that.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.376
[laughing]

14:04.410 --> 14:06.645
All right.
Hi.

14:06.678 --> 14:07.880
Hey, there he is!

14:07.914 --> 14:09.249
There's the man himself.
Mr. Monk.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.884
Oh, please, Adrian.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.384
Adrian, okay.
How are you?

14:12.418 --> 14:13.452
Good.
Good-good-good.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.922
Or--or--or age.

14:14.955 --> 14:15.754
Age.
Okay.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.889
All right, Age.
Okay, no problem.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.326
Listen, I wanna do that thing,
you know,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.326
with the hands.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.327
The thing you do
with the hands.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.328
Can you just
show me quickly?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.364
Oh, that?
Yeah.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.066
Yeah, that's like--
What is it?

14:26.099 --> 14:29.068
See, you look between
your fingers.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.636
Yeah?

14:30.669 --> 14:33.105
You just let your mind
go blank.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.474
Well, that won't be hard.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.043
[laughing]

14:38.077 --> 14:39.645
You let the room
wash over you.

14:39.678 --> 14:41.213
Yeah, all right.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.384
And you can go up,
or you can go down.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.485
Okay.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.453
And you can lean.

14:47.486 --> 14:52.459
Just making connections
and just looking for, uh--

14:52.491 --> 14:56.229
You're looking
for inconsistencies.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.431
I'm gonna do the same thing
with Brad Pitt.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.631
(David)
Is this an inconsistency?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.168
Oh, this is a mess.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.436
Uh, people,
the show's over.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.370
We got a job to do here.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.405
Lieutenant, why don't you
bring the Monk--

15:06.438 --> 15:08.942
This Monk up to speed?

15:08.975 --> 15:10.476
Yes, sir.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.645
Okay, the owner's name
was Alexis Orlov.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.383
He was robbed five times
in the last five years.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.451
So he slept downstairs
in the basement

15:18.485 --> 15:20.086
with a gun under his pillow.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.488
(both)
What kind of gun?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.355
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.424
No, that was--
That was a good question.

15:25.457 --> 15:26.426
That was good.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.659
I just felt instinctually
to, uh--

15:27.693 --> 15:29.428
No, you have to ask
what the weapon is.

15:29.461 --> 15:31.999
A revolver.
Smith and Wesson, .38.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.566
With a pearl handle.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.469
(Stottlemeyer)
Orlov ran up the stairs,
confronted the doer.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.971
There was a struggle,
the doer grabbed the gun

15:39.005 --> 15:40.373
and got off one shot.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.441
Then he ran out the front.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.710
Was anything missing?

15:43.743 --> 15:46.413
(Disher)
Uh, yeah, the victim's
daughter was in here.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.481
She did a quick inventory.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.317
Said the guy took some cash
from the register.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.519
Maybe 35 bucks.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.653
The Smith and Wesson
and a wristwatch.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.754
A wristwatch?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.323
(David)
Why would he
take only one?

15:57.356 --> 16:01.660
Why wouldn't he just
take everything in the case?

16:01.693 --> 16:02.995
Well, he was probably
in a hurry.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.297
He was afraid
someone heard the shot.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.399
(Monk)
No-no-no-no.

16:06.432 --> 16:10.202
It's clear from the footprints
that he came here first.

16:10.236 --> 16:13.740
But...

16:13.773 --> 16:15.642
he took the cheapest watch
in the case.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.710
Look, $72.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.711
Why would he take
the cheapest one

16:18.745 --> 16:19.745
and leave all the others?

16:19.778 --> 16:27.486
He must have been after
that particular watch.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.554
Wow.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.389
Wow.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.524
That's like...

16:31.557 --> 16:34.161
It's a gift and a curse.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.162
[laughing]

16:35.195 --> 16:36.395
I love it!

16:36.428 --> 16:38.230
Yeah, he says that
all the time.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.532
He does?
I love that!

16:39.566 --> 16:41.801
It's a gift...
and a curse.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.169
That's it.
You just nailed it.

16:43.202 --> 16:44.171
That's great.
Really good.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.139
No.
No-no-no.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.340
No?
Do it again for me.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.241
Do it again.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.378
It's a gift...
and a curse.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.479
See?

16:52.511 --> 16:54.614
It's a gift...
and a curse.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.582
No, that's not it.
Do it again.

16:56.615 --> 16:57.750
Say it again.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.288
(Monk)
It's a gift...
and a curse.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.522
And a curse.
A curse.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.523
Do it--okay.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.393
It's a gift.
Gift--gift.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.361
Gift--that--
that's almost.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.063
Gift.
It's a gift.

17:10.096 --> 17:11.463
It's a gift and a curse.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.232
(David)
It's a gift and a curse.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.433
(Monk)
No, that's not it.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.269
It's a gift.
It's a curse.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.837
It's a gift.
Put your mouth
in my ear.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.406
Gift.
It's a gift...

17:20.440 --> 17:21.441
Natalie?
Natalie.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.643
It's a gift.
Natalie--oh.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.444
Natalie?

17:25.478 --> 17:27.314
That's amazing.
Sounds all right?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.315
Yeah, you sound
just like him.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.481
It's almost.
It's almost--

17:29.516 --> 17:30.482
You know what
I'm gonna do, though.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.219
But I'm gonna tape--

17:32.251 --> 17:35.087
I wear, uh, I wear a wire
like you guys do.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.759
Oh, there you are.
What are you doing?

17:39.791 --> 17:40.826
Just getting some air.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.194
There's a lot of air inside.

17:42.229 --> 17:46.465
Everybody's in there.
Breathing away.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.468
Yeah, it's a little stuffy
for me in there.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.502
It's a gift and a curse.
It's a gift and a curse.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.770
It's a gift and a curse.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.806
Mr. Monk, don't you see?
It's already happening.

17:53.839 --> 17:54.673
What is?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.143
Okay, I've been doing
a little research

17:56.175 --> 17:57.809
on your new pal.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.278
Two years ago David Ruskin
played an alcoholic

17:59.311 --> 18:00.480
in a TV movie.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.182
He got so into it,
he had to check himself

18:03.215 --> 18:04.151
into rehab for three months.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.518
A lot of people
check themselves into rehab.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.554
He doesn't drink!
That's the thing.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.755
He had all the symptoms
of an alcoholic

18:08.788 --> 18:09.622
without drinking.

18:09.655 --> 18:12.659
He's had at least
two other breakdowns.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.494
Mr. Monk, I think
this man is dangerous.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.563
I think he's dangerous
to you.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.131
Maybe he's just dedicated.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.665
Did you ever think of that?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.501
Natalie, they're making
a movie about me.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.605
No, this is something
that I might actually

18:26.638 --> 18:31.310
come close
to almost enjoying.

18:46.858 --> 18:48.327
Scratch marks.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.734
This was moved recently.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.874
Plaster.

19:01.907 --> 19:05.778
I think the killer
exited this way.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.778
I thought he went out
the front door.

19:06.813 --> 19:10.849
Maybe he started to
and then he got scared,

19:10.883 --> 19:13.619
came back here.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.232
It's a gun.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.599
Don't touch it.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.903
We should get the captain.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.705
(Stottlemeyer)
We got the preliminary
ballistics back.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.741
It's the same gun.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.608
There's no fingerprints,
Monk.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.377
No palm prints.
Gun's been wiped clean.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.614
Wait.

19:41.647 --> 19:42.714
What do you got?

19:42.749 --> 19:45.652
Blue glitter.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.653
Glitter?

19:46.685 --> 19:47.619
From the other crime scene?

19:47.653 --> 19:50.423
Maybe you still had some
left on your hands.

19:50.457 --> 19:51.723
(Disher)
No-no-no-no.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.724
He never
touched the gun.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.326
I bagged it myself.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.394
Anyway, I've washed my hands
100 times

19:55.427 --> 19:57.630
since yesterday.

19:57.663 --> 19:58.631
Really?

19:58.664 --> 20:00.967
Exactly 100?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.303
It's a great number.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.306
So the guy that killed the girl
in North Beach on Thursday

20:06.338 --> 20:08.441
also killed
the pawn shop owner last night?

20:08.474 --> 20:10.843
That just doesn't track.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.613
It would explain
that watch he stole.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.815
Maybe--
He was replacing his own,
the one that broke.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.750
He's right.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.751
They're both right.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.488
(Stottlemeyer)
It's worth a shot.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.788
If there's a connection,
we'd better find it

20:22.821 --> 20:24.257
and find it fast.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.558
Okay, um, all the overtime
you need.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.260
Every available man.
Yes, sir.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.729
Let's start with victim one,
Michelle Cullman.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.698
Her file's on my desk.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.766
Maybe she knew
the pawnshop owner.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.734
Maybe she pawned something.

20:51.417 --> 20:55.587
Mr. Ruskin,
we're in the captain's office.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.593
Hello?
Mr. Ruskin?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.997
David.
Ah!

21:05.030 --> 21:07.567
Sorry.
Yeah, where--oh, okay.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.368
Yeah, sorry,
I got a little...

21:09.402 --> 21:10.970
Where are we,
the captain's office?

21:11.002 --> 21:11.903
Yeah.
Is that--yeah, good, right.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.420
Oh, is that egg salad
or tuna fish?

21:30.856 --> 21:32.659
Randy.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.224
Captain.

21:33.259 --> 21:36.363
What are you doing here?

21:36.395 --> 21:38.530
I was down the street
checking out a lead

21:38.565 --> 21:40.066
at the pawnshop.

21:40.098 --> 21:42.368
Had a couple of minutes
to kill.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.702
Stopped by.
I was curious.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.003
Any luck?

21:45.037 --> 21:47.374
In the case?

21:47.406 --> 21:48.775
No, it's a bear.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.609
I
mean, as far as we can tell
Michelle Cullman

21:50.643 --> 21:51.844
was never at the pawnshop.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.846
She never pawned anything.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.714
There's no connection
between them at all.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.715
Other than the fact
that they were both killed

21:56.749 --> 21:57.717
by the same guy.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.718
Keep digging.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.719
Yes, sir.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.520
All right, let's do this.

22:01.554 --> 22:02.622
What do you think
of the moustache?

22:02.654 --> 22:03.623
Moustache looks great.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.692
All right, everybody,
we are on.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.460
Scene 12, page 15.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.928
Captain Stottlemeyer, you enter.
You're on the phone!

22:08.961 --> 22:09.996
I need a cell phone.
Props, cell phone.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.864
Thanks.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.799
And, action.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.568
Uh, look, I know
he's a bit eccentric,

22:16.603 --> 22:17.636
but Adrian Monk is
the best damn investigator

22:17.670 --> 22:18.505
I've ever had.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.038
So you tell the mayor,
if he goes, I go.

22:20.071 --> 22:22.442
That's right.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.611
Lieutenant Disher!

22:24.644 --> 22:26.746
Lieutenant Disher,

22:26.778 --> 22:27.846
you got a minute?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.147
Yes, Captain?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.782
(male actor)
Uh, what the hell
do I say?

22:30.817 --> 22:31.983
The vic--I got it.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.721
The victim just received
a check for $50,000.

22:34.753 --> 22:35.822
Pretty weird time
to kill yourself.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.256
What do you think?

22:37.288 --> 22:38.324
(actress as Disher)
I'll tell you
what I think.

22:38.356 --> 22:41.894
I think the department
doesn't appreciate you enough.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.896
Randi,
what are you doing?

22:44.931 --> 22:46.999
I'm doing what you
taught me to do, Captain.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.068
Following my instincts.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.007
That never happened.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.008
Not even once.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.009
Shh.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.945
Oh!
[clears throat]

22:59.979 --> 23:01.681
Am I interrupting something?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.849
I was just, uh,
looking for evidence.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.951
In his mouth?

23:04.983 --> 23:08.954
Mr. Monk!
We're in here!

23:28.875 --> 23:31.644
Mmm.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.166
Something's not...

23:55.201 --> 23:58.938
Something's wrong here.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.641
How tall
was the victim?

24:01.673 --> 24:03.209
5'7".

24:03.241 --> 24:05.612
Hmm.

24:05.644 --> 24:06.613
Natalie, you're 5'7".

24:06.645 --> 24:10.916
Um, would you mind...

24:14.721 --> 24:18.990
I'd do it myself,
but I'm afraid of heights.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.026
And needles and germs
and milk.

24:20.058 --> 24:23.061
(male actor)
It just doesn't add up.

24:23.095 --> 24:26.598
Captain, I am
90 to 95% sure

24:26.633 --> 24:28.934
that Steve Wagner
killed this woman.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.737
The astronaut?
Monk, he was in space.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.605
Outer space.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.873
I don't know
how he did it,

24:33.905 --> 24:38.144
but he did it.

24:38.176 --> 24:40.913
He, um...

24:40.947 --> 24:43.615
Um...

24:43.650 --> 24:46.818
I'm sorry, I gotta stop.
Sorry.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.086
Sorry.

24:48.119 --> 24:49.855
David, you all right.
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.125
Just--I can't work like this.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.160
It's the crew.

24:54.192 --> 24:55.260
What about them?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.063
Well, I mean, look.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.197
He has his hat on backwards,
right?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.265
And he has his hat
on frontwards.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.601
This guy's hat
on backwards/forwards.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.836
And then backwards/forwards,
backwards/forwards.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.938
I mean everything's like all,
you know...

25:05.971 --> 25:06.905
Uh, so what?

25:06.939 --> 25:07.973
How am I supposed
to work like that, huh?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.141
I mean, how?

25:09.174 --> 25:11.644
Can you do that?
I can't.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.580
I mean, it's not
the way I work.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.981
So why don't you--I'll be
in my trailer, all right?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.549
And why don't you call me back
when everything

25:17.584 --> 25:19.786
is less, you know,
mixed up!

25:19.818 --> 25:21.820
All right?
Thanks!

25:24.624 --> 25:25.657
[knocking]

25:30.930 --> 25:32.330
Hello?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.933
Hey, Adrian.
Hey, it's Dave Ruskin.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.067
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:36.102 --> 25:40.006
Oh.
Yeah.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.875
Hey, hey.
How are you?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.948
What, uh--
What are you wearing?

25:48.980 --> 25:51.150
Oh, this is--

25:51.182 --> 25:52.984
the, uh, costume department
gave me this.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.787
Is there a problem?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.154
Yeah.
Yeah, there's a problem.

25:56.188 --> 25:59.759
It's my performance.

25:59.791 --> 26:03.061
Just today.
It was just crap.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.696
I don't have it.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.598
You don't have what?

26:06.633 --> 26:07.834
You.

26:07.866 --> 26:10.603
I mean, I don't...
I don't have...you.

26:10.636 --> 26:11.837
I mean, I have you.

26:11.871 --> 26:12.838
I have your tics
and your mannerisms

26:12.872 --> 26:14.306
and all that little like...

26:14.339 --> 26:16.008
You know like little...
tic-tic-tic-tic-tic.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.175
But that doesn't
mean anything.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.644
You know, that's nothing.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.278
That's just all, you know--
what is that, right?

26:20.311 --> 26:21.847
It's not the thing.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.782
It's just, like,
surface tension.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.786
It's like,
it's not the thing.

26:26.818 --> 26:28.086
Not the...
[takes a deep breath]

26:28.119 --> 26:32.357
The heart--the why.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.660
I need to know the why.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.294
How long
have you lived here?

26:35.326 --> 26:37.363
Uh...

26:37.395 --> 26:39.065
Okay.
See, here we go.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.000
This is it.
See, here's the thing.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.835
I want you to take me
to Monk school.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.236
And this is what I need.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.872
I need you to teach me.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.640
I mean, you have
all these compulsions.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.709
And these--you know,
these phobias.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.778
But it would cripple
most people.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.747
You--I mean,
you keep going.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.082
How do you--
sit down, relax.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.183
How do you do it?

26:58.217 --> 27:01.287
Why don't you stop?
Why do you do it?

27:01.319 --> 27:04.190
I need to know
why do you do it?

27:04.222 --> 27:08.259
Um, my job.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.829
No, that's not it.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.199
That's what I thought too,
but that is not it.

27:13.231 --> 27:15.366
No.
Is this her?

27:15.401 --> 27:17.836
Yeah.
Yeah, but please don't--

27:17.869 --> 27:19.838
This is Trudy?
Touch.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.909
She's beautiful.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.711
Tell me about her.
No.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.377
Tell me.

27:26.412 --> 27:31.317
I never deserved her.
The world never deserved her.

27:31.349 --> 27:33.419
You never deserved her.
Nobody deserved her?

27:33.451 --> 27:34.420
No, not...

27:34.452 --> 27:37.388
You never deserved her?

27:37.423 --> 27:39.224
No, I really...
I mean, the world...

27:39.258 --> 27:41.894
No one deserved her?
Not--um, nah.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.163
See that?
That's what I need to feel.

27:44.195 --> 27:47.066
I need to feel.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.366
I need to feel
what you feel.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.068
That's what I need to feel.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.703
You don't wanna do that.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.740
It's not a question of whether
I want to do it.

27:53.772 --> 27:57.242
I have to do it.
It's my job.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.846
All right?

27:59.878 --> 28:02.714
Some people don't believe that,
but I believe it.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.483
Because you have to tell
the truth of the story.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.854
If you don't
tell the truth of the story,

28:07.886 --> 28:09.255
then the whole st--

28:09.288 --> 28:10.521
Be careful.
It's a lie.

28:10.556 --> 28:14.125
And if you lie--if you lie,
then the audience doesn't care.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.263
They don't--what's this?

28:18.297 --> 28:23.134
Is this the way
she was killed?

28:23.169 --> 28:25.403
She...

28:25.436 --> 28:30.742
She said she was going out
to run an errand for Ambrose.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.478
Who's Ambrose?

28:32.510 --> 28:34.212
My brother.

28:37.115 --> 28:38.150
We have a brother?

28:38.183 --> 28:44.123
She pulled into
this parking garage

28:44.155 --> 28:46.424
on Giraldi Street.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.259
I know Giraldi Street.

28:48.294 --> 28:54.901
I still don't know
what she was doing there.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.903
And the person responsible
for this.

28:57.936 --> 28:59.305
The man who did this.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.307
He's still out there.

29:01.339 --> 29:05.010
Oh, yes.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.913
That must be torture.

29:07.946 --> 29:10.481
Is it torture?

29:10.516 --> 29:12.317
Yes, it's--

29:12.351 --> 29:15.320
Is it torture?

29:15.354 --> 29:20.491
It's--
Mmm-hmm.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.229
See, this is it.
This is the key.

29:23.261 --> 29:27.900
That's why you do this.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.970
You can't find
Trudy's killer,

29:31.002 --> 29:34.874
so you do
the next best thing.

29:34.906 --> 29:42.448
You track down
and you capture other criminals.

29:42.480 --> 29:45.351
It's not enough.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.586
No, it's not enough.

29:48.619 --> 29:50.521
It's not.
Not really.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.325
No, it's not enough.

29:55.326 --> 29:58.029
It'll never be enough.

29:58.064 --> 30:01.166
[knocking]

30:01.200 --> 30:03.869
Natalie, it's me.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.038
At least
I think it's me.

30:06.071 --> 30:08.106
Oh, my God, Mr. Monk,
what time is it?

30:08.140 --> 30:09.407
You were right
about actors.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.310
He's completely unstable.

30:12.344 --> 30:13.479
Oh, God,
what did he do?

30:13.511 --> 30:15.280
Oh, he's so selfish.
He's immature.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.183
Get this, he came barging
into my house

30:18.217 --> 30:19.384
in the middle
of the night.

30:19.417 --> 30:23.321
Woke me up because
he felt like talking.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.191
Can't imagine
what that would be like.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.393
So we talked for hours.

30:27.425 --> 30:31.864
I will say this, he gets me.
He really gets me.

30:31.897 --> 30:36.335
He understands
about Trudy.

30:36.367 --> 30:39.570
He was dredging up
these feelings.

30:39.605 --> 30:43.075
Feelings I haven't had
in years.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.376
And then he made us food.

30:45.411 --> 30:49.548
Fried eggs with the yolk
exactly in the center.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.549
I mean exactly.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.352
He used a ruler
just the way I like it.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.954
[sighs]

30:55.988 --> 30:59.424
It was confusing,
but delicious.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.426
Confusing.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.064
But delicious.

31:05.096 --> 31:08.099
And then he said
he was tired.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.634
And he asked me to leave.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.171
So you left?

31:12.203 --> 31:14.339
He has to get up
at 6:00.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.142
Mr. Monk,
that's your house.

31:16.174 --> 31:19.678
Boy, he's a good actor.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.548
All right, all right.
Okay.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.682
So you know what
we're gonna do?

31:23.714 --> 31:25.317
We're gonna call
that producer tomorrow

31:25.351 --> 31:26.919
to see if he has
any ideas, all right?

31:26.952 --> 31:31.522
So I guess you're staying
for the rest of the night?

31:31.557 --> 31:35.161
All right,
I'll get some sheets.

31:35.193 --> 31:39.498
No, whoa-whoa-whoa.
What's all this?

31:39.530 --> 31:42.000
Oh, some boy
wrote Julie a note.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.335
It's all ripped up.

31:43.368 --> 31:44.903
Oh, she didn't
want me to read it.

31:50.076 --> 31:54.246
So she tore it up.

31:54.279 --> 32:00.419
So no one
could see it.

32:00.451 --> 32:05.490
Make that piece--
no-no, that piece.

32:05.523 --> 32:07.326
Now, that's, uh...

32:07.358 --> 32:09.028
No, that's not his.
That's hers.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.497
Now, take that piece.
No, yeah, that piece.

32:11.529 --> 32:15.733
Uh, yes, raise yours,
Natalie.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.336
That could go a little
to the right.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.405
There.
Up.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.342
It's the hand.
Look, the hand.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.509
Yeah, that goes
to the right.

32:24.542 --> 32:25.611
Is that an eyebrow?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.512
No, that's a moustache.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.017
How you doin'?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.084
We were looking at this case
all wrong.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.385
It wasn't a burglary.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.522
It was all about
the wall.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.490
The whole time.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.492
Here's what happened.

32:43.729 --> 32:47.333
The killer was in here
last Thursday night.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.268
This is where he met
Michelle Cullman.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.136
They have an artist in here
a few nights a week

32:51.170 --> 32:52.637
sketching the customers.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.374
He drew their picture
right there on the wall.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.509
After the murder, the killer
remembered the sketch.

32:58.544 --> 33:01.012
That sketch could hang him.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.781
It could prove
that he was with the victim

33:03.815 --> 33:06.251
the night she died.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.519
And it would prove
what he was wearing.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.523
The same shirt we found
at the murder scene.

33:12.557 --> 33:13.459
He had to destroy
that sketch.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.227
So he smashed
through the wall

33:15.260 --> 33:16.494
and pretended it was
part of a burglary.

33:16.528 --> 33:20.531
He just pretended to be
breaking into a pawn shop.

33:20.566 --> 33:23.134
It was never
about the pawnshop.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.670
I know.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.438
You know?

33:26.471 --> 33:27.573
I was here ten minutes ago

33:27.605 --> 33:31.143
when Monk
was explaining it to you.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.753
(garage attendant)
Excuse me?

33:42.788 --> 33:44.589
Can I help you?

33:44.623 --> 33:48.660
I wish you could.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.529
I'm looking for clues.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.499
My wife Trudy
was murdered here.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.771
Okay, we made him!

34:00.806 --> 34:02.807
He paid with a credit card.
Can you believe that?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.710
He owns an auto dealership
in Livingston.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.378
Matty, get the street
tac team on the phone.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.081
I'm gonna wanna shut down
the entire block.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.117
Lieutenant, I'm talking to
a parking garage attendant.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.318
He's calling from
Giraldi Street.

34:13.351 --> 34:15.653
He says Adrian Monk is there.
He's been there for an hour.

34:15.686 --> 34:17.456
Acting kind of weird.
Talking to himself.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.724
He wants to know
if we can vouch for him.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.425
Yeah, Giraldi Street
is where Trudy was killed.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.427
He goes there all the time.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.327
Actually, let me
talk to this guy.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.795
Line two.

34:24.829 --> 34:29.235
Why would she back in?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.469
Mr. Monk.
It doesn't make sense.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.438
I just talked to
Lieutenant Disher.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.242
He wanted me to let you know
that they just ID'd the guy.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.342
Who?

34:37.376 --> 34:39.411
The man who killed Trudy?

34:39.445 --> 34:41.280
I don't know, all he said is
his name is Jack Leveret.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.282
He owns Leveret Motors
on Hamilton.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.449
And they're all
heading over there now.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.552
Finally.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.320
After all these years.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.190
Where's Hamilton Street?

34:51.222 --> 34:52.523
Three blocks east.
You can't miss it.

34:52.557 --> 34:54.360
Okay.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.661
Thanks!

35:03.434 --> 35:04.369
Sergeant, what the hell
is going on?

35:04.402 --> 35:06.572
(Sgt. Lyman)
Captain, stay down!

35:08.639 --> 35:09.775
We got a suspect in there.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.543
Change of plans.
We have a hostage situation.

35:12.577 --> 35:13.778
A man walked into the showroom
five minutes ago,

35:13.811 --> 35:15.481
waving a gun and
looking for the owner.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.614
He kept saying,
"You killed my wife.

35:16.648 --> 35:17.682
You killed Trudy."

35:17.715 --> 35:19.284
Trudy?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.554
It's Monk!

35:23.588 --> 35:25.423
It's Monk in there!

35:25.456 --> 35:26.858
Put your weapons down!

35:26.891 --> 35:28.927
Everybody relax!
Stand down!

35:28.960 --> 35:33.532
Put it down!

35:33.565 --> 35:34.900
What the hell
is he doing?

35:38.269 --> 35:40.871
Captain?

35:40.905 --> 35:42.673
What's it about?

35:44.675 --> 35:47.945
That's a little confusing.

35:47.978 --> 35:50.481
(David)
Do you know why she backed
into the parking space?

35:50.516 --> 35:52.918
Do you know why?
I'll tell you why.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.186
Because she was there
to meet you.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.920
But she didn't trust you.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.423
Mister, listen to me.
Listen to me!

35:58.456 --> 36:00.358
I swear to God I don't know
anybody named Trudy!

36:00.391 --> 36:01.427
Liar!
No!

36:01.460 --> 36:03.429
Shut up!

36:03.461 --> 36:04.496
David.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.264
David, David.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.367
Oh, my God.
There's another one?

36:09.400 --> 36:10.601
What are you guys from,
some cult?

36:10.635 --> 36:12.538
Help, somebody!

36:12.570 --> 36:13.871
Shut up!
Quiet!

36:13.905 --> 36:15.541
(Monk)
David!
David!

36:15.574 --> 36:17.543
Quiet!
David.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.844
David, David, come on.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.813
Adrian.
Adrian, listen.

36:21.847 --> 36:28.619
Oh, my God.
That's my weapon.

36:28.653 --> 36:29.855
You found my lockbox.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.956
You guessed the combination.

36:31.989 --> 36:35.260
I know my combination.
It's Trudy's birthday.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.996
And now I'm going
to give her

36:38.028 --> 36:39.664
the perfect birthday gift.

36:39.697 --> 36:40.766
No-no-no-no-no!

36:40.798 --> 36:44.436
Adrian, look-look-look.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.637
What?
Look.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.704
Look.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.940
That tag, that sticker
is peeling off.

36:48.974 --> 36:52.244
Why don't you fix that?

36:58.516 --> 37:02.487
No. No.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.989
Why don't you?
Okay.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.561
No, it's not.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.431
It's not really.
It's not.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.032
It's not really--
No, it's not.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.034
It's not really down.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.570
The left corner's bent.
Well, I know.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.373
No, there's a big bubble
in the middle.

37:21.407 --> 37:25.411
I know.
I know, I know.

37:25.443 --> 37:29.715
Okay, yeah.
That's good.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.916
Get it hard, though.

37:31.949 --> 37:34.786
I mean,
just press it down.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.422
That corner's torn.

37:36.454 --> 37:38.623
I know.
I know.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.057
Now there's two bubbles
in the back.

37:40.090 --> 37:41.927
More around.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.601
[grunting]

38:15.126 --> 38:16.327
No!

38:23.869 --> 38:27.373
Let go!

38:30.675 --> 38:32.010
No!
David!

38:32.043 --> 38:33.344
No-no-no!

38:33.378 --> 38:35.813
Adrian,
he didn't kill Trudy!

38:35.847 --> 38:37.047
He didn't kill Trudy.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.115
He killed a woman
named Michelle.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.317
Who?

38:39.351 --> 38:42.688
A woman named Michelle Cullman
and a pawnbroker named Orlov.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.889
Yes, that's true.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.590
I killed a woman,
and I killed an old man.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.458
I've never even met Trudy.
Who the hell is Trudy?

38:47.492 --> 38:50.762
She was my life!
She was my life!

38:50.795 --> 38:52.797
Adrian!
Okay, listen to me.

38:52.831 --> 38:59.971
Trudy wouldn't want you
to do this, would she?

39:00.005 --> 39:02.039
She wouldn't want you
to do this.

39:05.411 --> 39:06.878
No.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.715
No-no, not Trudy.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.650
No, she wouldn't want me...

39:11.682 --> 39:13.018
I know, I know.
It's okay.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.786
That's okay.
I know.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.920
That's okay.
I know.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.956
It's okay.
I know.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.891
I know.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.659
That's okay.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.630
I know.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.666
It's okay.
Shhh.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.469
I know.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.603
It's all right.
It's over now.

39:32.637 --> 39:38.577
Sorry, I just--
I was just--

39:38.610 --> 39:44.516
That day, she wanted me
to go with her.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.985
What?

39:48.018 --> 39:51.523
She wanted me
to go with her that day.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.958
And I--
No.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.025
No-no-no-no-no.

39:54.059 --> 39:58.929
Yeah.
Yeah, she did.

39:58.963 --> 40:03.601
It's my fault.

40:03.635 --> 40:07.038
It's my fault.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.840
That's right.

40:09.875 --> 40:11.476
I said I was tired.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.179
That's right, she...

40:14.211 --> 40:15.514
That's true.

40:15.547 --> 40:19.851
I'm sorry.
I could have saved her.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.987
I'm sorry.

40:22.019 --> 40:24.188
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

40:24.222 --> 40:29.226
Oh, Trudy.
Trudy.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.197
Oh, my God.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.800
[both crying]

40:35.833 --> 40:38.536
I'm sorry.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.907
Oh, Trudy.
Trudy.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.809
I didn't--
Didn't mean...

40:49.648 --> 40:52.117
(Dr. Kroger)
That must have been
a traumatic experience

40:52.150 --> 40:54.052
for you, Adrian.

40:54.085 --> 40:57.489
And what,
they cancelled the movie?

40:57.523 --> 40:59.724
He said he wanted to
play a character

40:59.757 --> 41:01.693
that wasn't so dark
and depressing.

41:01.726 --> 41:05.630
He's in England
doing Hamlet.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.934
How about the little getaway
you were planning?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.635
The weekend away?
Nah.

41:10.668 --> 41:11.603
All right, okay.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.905
Maybe another time.

41:13.938 --> 41:18.543
I guess I'm back
to square one.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.612
Ah, it's nice to be home.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.548
Adrian, please don't be hard
on yourself.

41:23.581 --> 41:25.650
Now, I think maybe
we should go back

41:25.684 --> 41:27.885
to the three days a week
for just a little while.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.655
That would be Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

41:30.688 --> 41:33.559
And Tuesdays.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.561
Tuesday would be four days
a week Adri--okay.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.527
No, I can see that.

41:36.561 --> 41:39.664
You know, just until
you're back on your feet.

41:39.697 --> 41:40.998
And Thursdays.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.735
Well, now, Thursdays
is five days a week, Adrian.

41:43.768 --> 41:46.003
Okay, that way,
five days a week,

41:46.036 --> 41:48.673
that would be easier
to remember.

41:48.706 --> 41:49.974
And Saturday.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.677
Well, Saturday
is the weekend, Adrian.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.713
And I don't like to
see patients on the weekends.

41:54.746 --> 41:55.981
Saturday.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.682
Adrian, I have a family.

41:57.715 --> 41:59.016
And I like
to keep the weekends free.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.050
Saturday.

42:00.085 --> 42:01.219
Saturday.
Okay, fine.

42:01.251 --> 42:03.688
We'll try that
for a week or two.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.791
So that would be Monday,
Tuesday...

42:05.824 --> 42:07.125
And Sunday.

42:09.260 --> 42:12.262
