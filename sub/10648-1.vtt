01:07.158 --> 01:08.105
What do you want from me?

01:11.003 --> 01:15.607
Huh? Tell me. What did...
what did I ever do to you?

01:20.845 --> 01:22.178
Answer me!

01:26.868 --> 01:29.415
_

01:31.867 --> 01:34.859
_

01:36.438 --> 01:40.032
_

02:00.051 --> 02:01.007
Happy birthday.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.811
You remembered. You know what?

02:07.609 --> 02:08.928
I can't accept this.

02:09.007 --> 02:11.570
It says "Property of Carol
Schlitzman" on the bottom.

02:12.427 --> 02:14.344
Dang, man, I thought I
scratched that off.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.101
Thanks, man, really.

02:17.133 --> 02:18.766
Don't thank me yet. I've got the crew

02:18.796 --> 02:20.765
coming to the hotel tonight,
and once I told them

02:20.852 --> 02:23.569
you're turning the big 3-0, they
promised to bring the pain.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.390
I don't think I recovered
from last year.

02:25.475 --> 02:28.176
It looks quiet.

02:28.261 --> 02:29.678
Get some, uh, quality of life shots

02:29.757 --> 02:32.039
to fill out the piece.
Just make it quick.

02:33.233 --> 02:35.517
I wanna get this party started!

02:36.968 --> 02:39.218
Careful!

03:33.608 --> 03:37.117
_

03:37.203 --> 03:39.609
_

03:56.433 --> 03:58.350
Hey. What happened?

03:58.443 --> 04:00.160
The Army's relocating these people!

04:00.278 --> 04:02.445
They got word they're
harboring terrorists!

04:02.531 --> 04:04.414
The terrorists here are the
ones they're creating.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.254
Kelly!

04:12.585 --> 04:13.468
Damien?

04:14.593 --> 04:17.351
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

04:20.776 --> 04:22.024
I meant to call.

04:23.427 --> 04:25.273
Hey, uh, Kelly, it's good to see you.

04:25.421 --> 04:28.304
Amani. Thought you'd come to
your senses and ditch this guy.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.806
Can't get rid of him.
Hey, listen, uh,

04:29.901 --> 04:32.070
what'd you see? Any chance
we can slip back in there?

04:32.203 --> 04:33.727
No, it's all closed off.

04:33.812 --> 04:37.364
- There's gonna be a massacre.
- So we're gonna have to stay put then.

04:37.482 --> 04:38.782
Are you kidding me? Absolutely not.

04:42.988 --> 04:45.789
I got this one.

04:50.746 --> 04:52.295
Aah! Ohh!

05:53.299 --> 05:55.656
Damien, I love you.

05:56.321 --> 05:58.321
It's all for you.

06:02.367 --> 06:06.820
<i>Hic est filius meus dilectus...</i>

06:06.905 --> 06:10.657
It's all for you!
Damien, I love you!

06:17.132 --> 06:18.998
Stand up. Get up!

07:00.542 --> 07:01.708
Who are you looking for?

07:01.793 --> 07:03.343
- A woman.
- Who?

07:03.461 --> 07:06.963
This, uh, woman grabbed me.
She knew my name.

07:07.048 --> 07:09.594
- Another journalist?
- No, no, from here, from Damascus.

07:09.712 --> 07:12.635
She said stuff. Stuff she
couldn't have known.

07:12.721 --> 07:13.937
She did... something.

07:14.022 --> 07:17.307
I saw memories from my
childhood when I was a kid

07:17.442 --> 07:20.527
when my parents... no, an
accident had happened.

07:20.645 --> 07:21.764
Thought you said you don't
remember your childhood.

07:21.936 --> 07:24.397
No, she brought all back. I was 5.
It was my birthday.

07:24.482 --> 07:25.982
We gotta find out where
these trucks are going.

07:26.117 --> 07:28.484
Hey, Kelly!

07:32.707 --> 07:34.776
I'm hooking up a ride.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.993
This guy says he knows where
these people are being relocated.

07:37.078 --> 07:38.344
He'll take us there for $500.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.966
- Hey, I'll meet you back at the hotel.
- No, dude, you know better

07:43.051 --> 07:44.584
than to just get in a car with a local.

07:44.669 --> 07:48.388
- We could end up hostages.
- I have to find her, all right?

07:49.925 --> 07:52.392
Hey! Hey!

07:52.510 --> 07:53.893
Hey, come on.

07:54.012 --> 07:57.839
- Whoa.
- Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:57.894 --> 07:58.769
Okay, okay.

07:58.794 --> 08:01.419
All journalists are being
deported immediately.

08:10.306 --> 08:12.798
_

08:19.428 --> 08:24.232
I'm sure this will get picked up by
"Time," HuffPo, maybe "The New Yorker."

08:24.317 --> 08:26.234
You might be looking at a Pulitzer.

08:26.369 --> 08:27.704
I have to get back there.

08:27.742 --> 08:29.333
You know we shouldn't
have been thrown out.

08:30.061 --> 08:32.789
The only thing I know
is my boss is gonna ask

08:32.828 --> 08:34.576
why I'm still doing business with you.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.006
Because he's the only one
who gets close enough.

08:37.499 --> 08:38.782
You have to get us back there.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.034
Honey, that's just not gonna happen.

08:41.119 --> 08:43.370
You've been banned from entering Syria.

08:43.505 --> 08:44.930
Just give it a few months...

08:44.985 --> 08:47.424
This can't wait. Something is going on.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.149
- If this is about the private...
- No, it's not that.

08:50.814 --> 08:51.627
Then what?

09:02.923 --> 09:05.064
- Hello?
<i>- Kelly, it's Damien.</i>

09:05.777 --> 09:07.227
Are you all right?

09:07.312 --> 09:09.946
- Where the hell are you?
- New York. Listen.

09:10.065 --> 09:11.398
Did you find out where they
relocated the Christians?

09:11.533 --> 09:12.982
I-I need to find that old woman,

09:13.068 --> 09:14.900
- the one who grabbed me.
- I saw.

09:15.570 --> 09:18.405
She grabbed your face and
said, "Damien, I love you."

09:18.540 --> 09:21.958
- Can you find her?
- Why should I help you?

09:24.329 --> 09:27.634
- We had something. We did. But...
- And you just disappeared?

09:28.283 --> 09:30.066
<i>No explanation?</i>

09:30.168 --> 09:32.064
It was the only way.
You have to trust me.

09:32.342 --> 09:34.509
I did trust you.

09:38.134 --> 09:39.967
Can you find that woman?

09:42.147 --> 09:43.088
I'll try.

09:44.243 --> 09:45.376
Thank you.

09:54.910 --> 09:57.080
Thank you, Tiffany.
I'll take it from here.

09:59.114 --> 10:03.875
- Damien Thorn. Long time.
- Good to see you, Cray. I, uh...

10:03.980 --> 10:05.846
I hope you don't mind me interrupting.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.337
- I could use a favor.
- Hmm.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.372
Us Preston Hall brothers have
to stick together, right?

10:09.458 --> 10:11.091
Haven't seen you in 15 years.

10:11.176 --> 10:13.877
Uh, staying in touch... it's
not one of my strong suits.

10:14.469 --> 10:15.885
I was covering a story in Syria.

10:15.992 --> 10:17.964
It's landed me in hot water
with the current regime.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.183
They won't let me step
foot inside the country.

10:20.302 --> 10:21.518
You have other connections.

10:21.636 --> 10:24.137
Well, I could call Dean Behringer,
but he's got his hands full.

10:24.272 --> 10:26.978
I really didn't want to call in a favor
for something this small.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.443
The head of the IMF owes you a favor?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.111
Well, aren't they what
makes our world go round?

10:32.168 --> 10:35.061
Let me talk to my colleagues,
see if we can't put our heads together

10:35.086 --> 10:37.553
and figure something out. I'm
sure there's a solution.

10:38.036 --> 10:41.154
I appreciate that. You know, I always
said you were one of the good ones.

10:41.289 --> 10:42.931
Hmm. You can see yourself out.

10:51.774 --> 10:53.368
Damien Thorn.

10:55.081 --> 10:57.715
I can't believe it's really you.

10:58.223 --> 11:01.391
- It's been a long time.
- Sorry. Do I know you?

11:01.510 --> 11:03.426
Ann Rutledge.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.514
Last time I saw you was
at your father's funeral.

11:10.185 --> 11:11.899
You knew my father.

11:11.975 --> 11:16.480
He was such a good man.
Impeccable character.

11:16.691 --> 11:21.809
For him, to suffer
such a tragic death...

11:23.068 --> 11:27.167
But you were so young.
I imagine you don't remember much.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.192
Sadly, no.

11:30.038 --> 11:31.676
Mm-hmm. That'll change.

11:32.174 --> 11:36.754
- Uh, why do you say that?
- Because it's a whole new world.

11:37.212 --> 11:39.856
The seal's been broken,
the trumpet blown.

11:40.832 --> 11:42.264
I don't follow.

11:42.384 --> 11:44.059
Your father would have been proud.

11:44.636 --> 11:46.469
You have so much to offer.

11:46.555 --> 11:49.389
I, uh, I take pictures.

11:49.474 --> 11:53.526
Humility's
an overrated virtue.

11:53.965 --> 11:58.684
It couldn't have been easy for you,
expelled from school after school,

11:58.900 --> 12:02.402
Preston, Exeter, Oxford...
you'd think those people would

12:02.496 --> 12:06.191
would be more forgiving
to a boy so obviously...

12:06.293 --> 12:07.668
Gifted.

12:10.965 --> 12:13.176
You seem to know a lot
about where I've been.

12:13.748 --> 12:16.416
The past is like a noose
around our necks.

12:17.629 --> 12:18.777
Wouldn't you say?

12:22.140 --> 12:27.343
Truth is... I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't keep my eyes and ears open

12:27.429 --> 12:29.106
about Damien Thorn.

12:30.484 --> 12:32.484
And what exactly is your job, miss...

12:32.850 --> 12:34.016
Rutledge.

12:35.363 --> 12:39.439
I suppose it would best be described
as the protection business.

12:39.832 --> 12:42.848
I look out for special interests.

12:43.445 --> 12:44.462
Whose?

12:44.487 --> 12:47.536
In my line of work,
discretion is paramount.

12:48.283 --> 12:51.951
The key is to always maintain a presence

12:52.973 --> 12:56.673
without letting people know
you've been there all along,

12:57.262 --> 12:59.121
right over their shoulder.

12:59.830 --> 13:01.785
Every step of the way.

13:04.215 --> 13:07.133
I just wanted to introduce myself.

13:07.209 --> 13:10.731
It's so exciting to see
how much you've grown.

13:11.684 --> 13:14.952
Our paths have crossed before,
you know, I'm sure of it.

13:49.546 --> 13:50.819
Did you find her?

13:51.218 --> 13:53.051
<i>I asked everyone who
lived in that encampment.</i>

13:53.136 --> 13:55.720
<i>No one had ever seen her.
I found something else.</i>

13:56.717 --> 13:58.584
I'm back in New York.
I'll text you my address.

13:59.015 --> 14:00.798
<i>You'll want to see it.</i>

14:18.985 --> 14:21.217
I had it translated.

14:21.421 --> 14:23.201
It's Latin.

14:23.366 --> 14:28.286
She's saying, "here's my beloved son,
in whom I am well pleased."

14:28.371 --> 14:32.990
According to the Gospel of <i> Matthew,</i>
when John the Baptist baptized Christ,

14:33.256 --> 14:38.239
the sky opened and a voice called out
those exact words.

14:40.952 --> 14:44.378
Christ was supposedly
baptized when he turned 30.

14:49.135 --> 14:52.471
It was my 30th birthday
the day she grabbed me.

14:52.651 --> 14:55.420
And you were covered in
her blood, weren't you?

14:56.655 --> 14:58.194
Baptized in it.

14:59.324 --> 15:04.347
Christ started his ministry after
his baptism, his preaching.

15:07.100 --> 15:11.885
I've been having visions.
No, uh... memories...

15:12.881 --> 15:14.847
That I haven't had before.

15:24.514 --> 15:26.420
There was a party.

15:28.685 --> 15:32.710
I was 5. My... parents were still alive.

15:33.249 --> 15:39.850
There were, uh... ponies and carousels.

15:41.664 --> 15:43.397
And, uh...

15:44.450 --> 15:46.296
Someone shouted out my name,

15:48.588 --> 15:49.796
that they loved me.

15:51.257 --> 15:54.085
My governess was standing on the ledge

15:54.761 --> 15:58.608
in front of everyone with
a rope around her neck.

16:01.551 --> 16:06.387
Uh... She looked straight at me,

16:06.522 --> 16:07.882
and she said...

16:09.928 --> 16:11.475
"It's all for you."

16:13.896 --> 16:15.842
And then she jumped to her death.

16:17.330 --> 16:18.639
Jesus.

16:19.485 --> 16:22.342
How could that old woman
know those exact words?

16:25.708 --> 16:30.061
This is why I left, Kelly.
I couldn't drag you into this.

16:30.797 --> 16:35.332
- Into what?
- This... th-this... shit.

16:35.418 --> 16:38.616
I thought it was crazy, but
there's always been...

16:40.044 --> 16:43.929
Someone else, some...
some thing, like a...

16:43.954 --> 16:46.254
Like a dark cloud hanging over me.

16:46.302 --> 16:50.468
I-I've... I've ignored it. I've denied
it, but it's always been there.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.373
And when that... when that
old woman grabbed me,

16:54.398 --> 16:58.522
it was like it was... it was
inside me now, growing,

16:58.608 --> 17:00.574
and...

17:00.660 --> 17:03.546
This is... my sister, Simone.

17:04.280 --> 17:05.638
Damien Thorn.

17:06.912 --> 17:11.133
I know who you are.
Good to finally meet you.

17:14.959 --> 17:19.124
Don't let me interrupt.
You guys need anything?

17:20.429 --> 17:21.396
We're good.

17:23.299 --> 17:25.483
I stay here when I'm in New York.

17:28.721 --> 17:30.936
You came all the way back
from Damascus for this?

17:35.545 --> 17:36.670
Uh... uh...

17:37.563 --> 17:39.730
Thank you for... for... for this,

17:39.816 --> 17:41.198
for trying to help.

17:41.317 --> 17:43.784
Wait. What about that old woman?

17:43.870 --> 17:45.428
How are you gonna find her?

17:48.241 --> 17:49.991
I have no idea.

17:59.502 --> 18:01.585
It's the only shot of the
old woman I could find.

18:01.671 --> 18:04.171
Look, I told you, I took,
like, three, four singles.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.173
Look, man, I've been through everything.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.675
This is the only image she's in.

18:07.810 --> 18:09.643
Then we'll go through everything again

18:09.729 --> 18:11.595
even if it takes all night.

18:11.681 --> 18:13.147
What's the big deal?

18:29.459 --> 18:31.699
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.417
Uh, actually, we've...

18:33.536 --> 18:35.786
Uh, we were just finished up. Um...

18:35.872 --> 18:39.154
See if you can find
that and call me later?

18:39.187 --> 18:40.353
Sure thing.

18:40.877 --> 18:43.794
Listen, uh, I would love to, uh, hang.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.846
You see how the bossman
is, wants what he wants.

18:46.871 --> 18:47.834
I know.

18:47.859 --> 18:50.026
Was, um, was good to see you.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.919
You, too.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.202
These pictures...

19:02.327 --> 19:04.304
why do you have them
hanging in your home?

19:04.950 --> 19:05.803
The pain.

19:10.706 --> 19:13.824
That dark cloud that's
been following you.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.350
You can't let it in.

19:17.246 --> 19:18.462
But that doesn't mean

19:18.581 --> 19:20.881
you have to shut out
everything else, either.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.932
No, you're right.

19:25.471 --> 19:27.038
You're always right.

19:38.768 --> 19:42.319
I looked for stories
about your birthday party.

19:42.438 --> 19:45.189
I couldn't find anything,
but I did find this.

19:47.827 --> 19:50.796
The photographer, Jennings,
was killed in Megiddo.

19:52.555 --> 19:54.221
He knew your father.

19:54.450 --> 19:56.617
My father was a public figure.

19:56.702 --> 19:59.503
Another death all within
the same few weeks.

20:00.350 --> 20:02.959
That still doesn't explain
anything about the old woman.

20:04.795 --> 20:08.046
This article says Jennings
died near Megiddo...

20:08.071 --> 20:10.321
an archaeological site in Israel.

20:10.346 --> 20:12.262
It was the only connection I
can find to the Middle East

20:12.287 --> 20:13.836
in any of this.

20:14.006 --> 20:16.423
I was able to access your
father's travel log.

20:16.806 --> 20:19.960
He was in Megiddo when Jennings died.

20:20.403 --> 20:21.639
Why?

20:21.795 --> 20:24.623
The excavation was run by...

20:24.864 --> 20:27.731
Carl Bugenhagen, a
renowned biblical scholar.

20:27.817 --> 20:28.889
Died later that same year.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.562
I located a doctoral student

20:30.587 --> 20:32.137
who was working with him at the time.

20:32.503 --> 20:34.135
He might be worth talking to.

21:01.934 --> 21:03.404
Professor Reneus?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.763
I'm Kelly Baptiste. We
spoke on the phone.

21:07.930 --> 21:11.037
Oh, yes, yes, the woman
from the newspaper.

21:11.359 --> 21:14.661
You wanted to know about my
old teacher, Bugenhagen.

21:15.031 --> 21:16.914
Damien Thorn.

21:20.975 --> 21:21.725
May I?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.394
I don't have very much time.

21:48.405 --> 21:50.343
Thank you for seeing us.

21:51.117 --> 21:52.483
Damien's father...

21:52.568 --> 21:54.485
I know exactly who you are, Mr. Thorn.

21:55.311 --> 21:58.365
You were a bit of an obsession for Dr.
Bugenhagen.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.428
Why is that?

22:02.155 --> 22:03.764
Do you know who he was?

22:05.131 --> 22:06.663
A biblical scholar.

22:07.288 --> 22:09.084
He was one of the
world's leading experts

22:09.168 --> 22:11.919
on the Book of <i> Revelation.</i>

22:12.004 --> 22:13.874
My father sought him out. Why?

22:15.294 --> 22:17.592
That was a long time ago.

22:17.760 --> 22:21.895
We've come a long way to learn
why my father, a politician,

22:21.981 --> 22:23.931
would seek out a biblical scholar.

22:24.016 --> 22:25.933
He was not a God-fearing man.

22:26.018 --> 22:27.796
Your father wanted answers...

22:29.358 --> 22:30.713
about the Beast.

22:31.923 --> 22:33.358
The False Messiah...

22:35.945 --> 22:39.696
described in the Book of <i> Revelation.</i>

22:46.700 --> 22:48.116
Servant of Satan.

22:48.295 --> 22:50.245
He is to be worshiped like a king.

22:51.428 --> 22:54.022
And then his true nature
will be revealed.

22:55.798 --> 22:59.435
He will become the greatest
tyrant the world has ever seen,

22:59.593 --> 23:04.679
plunging it into darkness,
plague, famine, war...

23:05.024 --> 23:07.641
the end of days...

23:07.776 --> 23:10.882
until he is defeated
by the returned Christ

23:11.217 --> 23:13.384
during the Last Judgment.

23:16.357 --> 23:17.689
The Antichrist.

23:17.714 --> 23:20.631
That word is never actually
used in <i> Revelation,</i>

23:21.577 --> 23:24.515
but the early church fathers
believed that the Beast

23:24.678 --> 23:26.660
and the Antichrist are the same.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.936
<i>Thessalonians</i> calls him
the Man of Lawlessness.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.006
The Devil has many names.

23:34.253 --> 23:36.327
What does this have
to do with my father?

23:37.764 --> 23:40.256
He was a diplomat, was he not?

23:40.893 --> 23:42.676
Many expect the Beast

23:42.811 --> 23:45.846
to come from the world of politics.

23:46.741 --> 23:48.982
When <i> Revelation</i> was first written...

23:51.153 --> 23:53.030
It was the Emperor Nero

23:54.823 --> 23:56.858
that recognized him by his number...

23:57.443 --> 24:00.921
666.

24:02.164 --> 24:03.936
Does that mean anything to you?

24:05.318 --> 24:06.650
No.

24:06.869 --> 24:10.170
Do these people look familiar?

24:12.157 --> 24:13.824
No, I don't believe so.

24:14.293 --> 24:17.010
- The man was a photographer...
- Thanks for your time.

24:27.723 --> 24:31.141
Mr. Thorn!

24:33.612 --> 24:37.531
You must accept Christ as your savior.

24:39.618 --> 24:41.735
Accept Christ. It's your only hope.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.788
Drink his blood. Eat his flesh.

24:44.907 --> 24:46.156
Accept our savior.

24:46.242 --> 24:48.792
What are you saying, that
my father was right?

24:48.911 --> 24:51.578
He may not be fire and brimstone, Mr.
Thorn,

24:51.714 --> 24:54.214
but the Devil does exist.

24:54.300 --> 24:57.751
He lurks in the dark
corners of the heart.

25:09.231 --> 25:12.232
This was a waste of time.

27:03.178 --> 27:05.762
Aah!

27:33.158 --> 27:36.002
You haven't said two words
since we left the college.

27:36.775 --> 27:37.885
What do you want me to say?

27:38.360 --> 27:40.994
Obviously, other people

27:41.113 --> 27:43.713
noticed all the coincidences around you.

27:44.166 --> 27:47.931
You expect me to believe
that there's really a God,

27:47.957 --> 27:50.674
there's really a Devil, and I'm
on the wrong side. Bullshit.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.557
I don't have all the answers.

27:58.088 --> 27:59.268
Neither do you.

28:09.788 --> 28:10.954
Hello?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.939
Yes, this is she.

28:13.965 --> 28:15.848
Yes, I was there today.

28:17.519 --> 28:18.557
Oh, my God.

28:21.773 --> 28:24.447
Of course. Thank you.

28:30.899 --> 28:32.865
Reneus was killed.

28:34.089 --> 28:36.402
Cops say he was mauled by some animal.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.152
This is because of me.

28:45.699 --> 28:47.365
I told you.

28:52.823 --> 28:54.722
Whatever's going on...

28:55.242 --> 28:56.574
You're not alone.

28:56.972 --> 28:57.959
Let me help you.

28:58.078 --> 28:59.503
No, you have to go.

29:00.638 --> 29:03.722
No. We can handle this.

29:04.167 --> 29:07.688
No... there is no... "we."

29:07.713 --> 29:11.042
I-I... shouldn't have called you.
This was a mistake.

29:11.391 --> 29:15.136
Don't say that. This has
nothing to do with you.

29:15.167 --> 29:17.410
Yes, it does. It does.

29:18.265 --> 29:20.765
Kelly, you...

29:23.103 --> 29:24.352
You have to go.

29:24.438 --> 29:26.074
Leave me alone.

29:26.907 --> 29:27.946
Don't do this.

29:28.025 --> 29:28.831
Get out.

31:43.660 --> 31:47.662
Aah! Somebody help!

31:54.254 --> 31:56.137
Help me!

31:57.674 --> 32:00.926
- Whoa! I got you. I got you.
- Get me out.

32:01.011 --> 32:03.728
Something grabbed me.

32:03.847 --> 32:05.680
Something grabbed me!

32:05.766 --> 32:07.983
No, no!

32:08.068 --> 32:11.519
No, no, Kelly! No!

32:11.655 --> 32:13.989
Kelly! Help!

32:37.698 --> 32:39.114
Here we go.

32:50.648 --> 32:52.100
Ma'am, ma'am, please, no.

32:52.281 --> 32:54.815
Let me go! I'm her sister.

32:55.781 --> 32:57.522
Did you find her?

33:06.281 --> 33:08.148
No, no.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.023
Is there anyone...

34:12.112 --> 34:13.460
Uh, I can call?

34:29.320 --> 34:33.335
We were always so afraid that
our plane would go down,

34:34.484 --> 34:36.476
or... she'd get hurt in the field.

34:40.531 --> 34:42.281
She was fearless.

34:45.742 --> 34:48.242
She's
in a better place.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.554
You don't believe that, do you?

34:57.721 --> 35:00.898
I, uh... don't know what to believe.

35:02.593 --> 35:04.405
She can't be gone.

35:06.679 --> 35:08.585
This can't be all we have.

35:11.652 --> 35:14.476
I really need
to believe that right now.

35:15.849 --> 35:18.182
Death isn't the end.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.633
Dad?

35:37.544 --> 35:38.968
It's about Kelly.

36:07.825 --> 36:10.890
He visited that Igor Reneus last night.

36:12.546 --> 36:14.148
What did Reneus say?

36:17.501 --> 36:18.663
He's dead.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.272
How is it possible?

36:24.758 --> 36:28.393
Thorn was in Damascus, not in Israel.

36:30.431 --> 36:32.674
The Beast is to rise from
the Holy Land itself.

36:34.935 --> 36:37.736
The road through Jerusalem?

36:37.821 --> 36:41.656
Rome runs through Damascus.

36:41.775 --> 36:47.162
That's where Saint Paul
saw the risen Christ,

36:47.281 --> 36:50.665
and the whole world was swept away.

37:06.467 --> 37:09.601
I told you we waited too long.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.049
What do you want from me?

38:33.863 --> 38:37.648
Huh? Tell me... what...
what did I ever do to you?

38:40.145 --> 38:44.152
My mother, my... my fa... my father.

38:46.042 --> 38:46.902
How many more?

38:49.949 --> 38:50.941
You d...

38:52.308 --> 38:53.941
You
didn't have to kill her.

39:00.235 --> 39:03.236
Why?

39:07.055 --> 39:10.723
Why?

39:15.104 --> 39:16.074
Answer me!

39:50.189 --> 39:54.113
Daddy! Daddy!

39:58.698 --> 40:00.386
Please, Daddy, no!

40:19.566 --> 40:20.558
It's you.

40:23.766 --> 40:25.566
How... how did you get here?

40:25.591 --> 40:27.925
What? What? Why did
you say those things?

40:27.977 --> 40:29.183
What... what... what's all for me?

40:29.255 --> 40:31.370
No, wait. Well, how... who are you?

40:32.598 --> 40:34.347
- Aah!
- Hey, hey!

40:34.573 --> 40:35.766
Get away from her!
