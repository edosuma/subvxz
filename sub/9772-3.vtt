21:49.224 --> 21:51.560
Clearly,
my parents aren't coming.

21:53.937 --> 21:56.606
I've never been treated
with so much disrespect.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.650
Well, I have,
but not by my parents.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.908
- Okay,
I just wanna go on record

22:06.992 --> 22:08.243
saying that me and Logan
owe you guys big time

22:08.326 --> 22:10.120
for proving we were innocent.
- We do.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.622

we never doubted you guys

got the best of me.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.019
you dried-up old fruit bat.
[laughs]

22:34.102 --> 22:37.189
Your handsome dean
whupped me halfway to Glasgow

22:37.272 --> 22:39.024
and back again.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.026
