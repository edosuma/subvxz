00:05.469 --> 00:07.387
<i>The dictionary defines
"defenestration </i> . .

00:07.554 --> 00:11.433
<i>...as the act of throwing
a person or thing out a window.</i>

00:12.601 --> 00:15.229
<i>Really not my favorite word.</i>

00:22.819 --> 00:25.697
Okay, where's the dude
with the nasty 'tude?

00:30.744 --> 00:33.539
Present and accounted for.

00:59.523 --> 01:01.441
Hey. Did I mess up your costume?

01:01.608 --> 01:04.694
Leave off the threads, Emerald Elf,
and that's an order.

01:05.236 --> 01:09.074
But the Green Goblin
doesn't take orders from insects.

01:09.241 --> 01:12.452
The Green Goblin
swats them into oblivion.

01:12.661 --> 01:15.789
That's a common misconception.
Spiders are actually arachnids--

02:35.661 --> 02:39.164
May I see your invitation,
Spider-Man?

02:39.331 --> 02:42.376
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you to leave.

02:42.626 --> 02:45.379
Leave now? When Table 7
needs more hors d'oeuvres?

02:45.712 --> 02:49.466
<i>How'd a night that started out
so sweet go south so fast?</i>

02:49.633 --> 02:53.512
<i>And how'd I manage to leave my tux
at tonight's other black tie affair?</i>

03:08.777 --> 03:11.071
- Thanks for the ride, Harry.
- No prob.

03:11.279 --> 03:13.532
My chauffeur's at our beck and call.

03:13.699 --> 03:15.992
Don't forget to vote
for king and queen.

03:16.159 --> 03:17.953
Who are you voting for, Glory?

03:18.120 --> 03:21.498
Me and Liz, of course.
Who else is worthy?

03:21.665 --> 03:24.710
I think we know the answer
to that, don't we, Rand?

03:24.876 --> 03:27.337
Far as I'm concerned,
Osborn can have the crown.

03:27.504 --> 03:29.506
His limo. His after-party.

03:29.673 --> 03:31.842
Dude rules.

03:32.008 --> 03:33.677
We're going to Le Hisayfitte...

03:33.844 --> 03:36.346
...the best restaurant in town.
My treat.

03:36.513 --> 03:40.684
- Osborn, you the man.
- You know it.

03:41.101 --> 03:42.728
Hi, Harry. Did you just get here?

03:42.894 --> 03:46.106
Hey, let's get a picture.
You know, preserve the moment.

03:46.606 --> 03:51.403
Guess that bow tie stops the blood
from reaching his ears or brain.

03:51.653 --> 03:53.363
And the chocolate soufflé is a must.

03:53.530 --> 03:56.241
They top it with powdered sugar
and gold dust.

03:56.408 --> 04:00.370
- I don't believe it.
- It's true. Real gold dust.

04:00.996 --> 04:02.622
Guys?

04:12.716 --> 04:16.011
Miss Brant!
This fershlugginer bowtie's defective.

04:16.178 --> 04:17.762
I want a new one round my neck.

04:17.928 --> 04:21.016
Come on, Mr. J., an investigation
into Spider-Man's identity.

04:21.224 --> 04:23.018
"See the face behind the mask."

04:23.435 --> 04:26.563
- And if the face is Joe Shmoe?
- Hold still, please.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.940
All you'll do is make
web-head a regular guy.

04:29.149 --> 04:31.693
And who'll pay to see pictures
of a regular guy?

04:31.860 --> 04:34.613
Depends on what that
regular guy does, right, Pop?

04:34.780 --> 04:36.948
John, my boy.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.035
Give your old man a hug.

04:40.243 --> 04:43.038
Hey, Mr. Robertson.
You keeping Pop in line?

04:43.246 --> 04:44.581
I do my best, son.

04:44.748 --> 04:47.417
- You know, he's awful proud of you.
- Why shouldn't I be?

04:47.667 --> 04:51.546
Betty Brant, Ned Lee, meet my son
Air Force Colonel John Jameson.

04:51.755 --> 04:54.591
John's piloting his first mission
on the space shuttle...

04:54.758 --> 04:58.804
...so I'm taking him out for one final
night on the town-- Planet.

04:58.970 --> 05:00.597
Get it? Foswell. Benny.

05:00.764 --> 05:02.432
Come meet my son the astronaut.

05:02.599 --> 05:05.393
Ned. That Spider-Man exposé?

05:05.560 --> 05:08.438
Run with it. See where it leads.

05:08.939 --> 05:11.650
Mary Jane Watson,
this is Professor Warren.

05:11.817 --> 05:13.401
I'm his star pupil.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.237
He said he wasn't coming.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.323
Guess he meant
he wasn't coming with me.

05:19.741 --> 05:22.118
How the heck did
Puny Parker land her?

05:22.285 --> 05:24.120
Pete cleans up well.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.335
It's not just the food.
The view from the private room--

05:30.502 --> 05:34.005
Geeks like Parker do not get girls
who look like her. I mean, like us.

05:34.214 --> 05:37.133
- She must have lost a bet.
- The bet. That's it.

05:41.304 --> 05:46.726
Mary Jane Watson, I'd like you to meet
Flash, Liz, Rand, Sally, Glory...

05:46.935 --> 05:48.353
...and my best bud, Harry.

05:48.603 --> 05:51.481
- They're popular.
- The in-crowd.

05:51.648 --> 05:52.983
Exactly.

05:53.149 --> 05:54.359
So, Parker...

05:54.609 --> 05:56.611
...you actually got yourself a date.

05:56.778 --> 06:00.031
I mean, sure, Mary here's not
the 20-year-old you wanted to bring...

06:00.240 --> 06:04.953
...but at least she's nonfictional.
So I guess you win the bet.

06:05.829 --> 06:07.873
- What'd you bet?
- Loser dresses...

06:08.039 --> 06:10.000
...as a cheerleader for Halloween.

06:10.166 --> 06:13.378
Well, big boy, I hope you've got
the legs for the skirt.

06:13.545 --> 06:15.505
Come on, tiger,
let's hit the dance floor.

06:15.672 --> 06:17.173
I wanna see what you've got.

06:20.051 --> 06:21.761
We're dancing.

06:24.639 --> 06:25.682
Shall we?

06:25.849 --> 06:28.685
Maybe when everyone has a little
less to prove, you know?

06:28.852 --> 06:31.396
Less to prove. Right.
Want some punch?

06:31.563 --> 06:33.064
Please.

06:51.708 --> 06:52.876
Look, Glory...

06:53.209 --> 06:55.337
...I know I was a jerk, but--

06:55.503 --> 06:56.796
But I'm really sorry.

06:57.005 --> 07:00.050
Just give me one more chance.
Please?

07:00.216 --> 07:01.927
Oh, Kenny.

07:29.162 --> 07:32.207
Hello? ls someone there?

07:33.416 --> 07:37.337
Look at yourself, Otto.
You're afraid of your own shadow.

07:37.504 --> 07:39.506
Next you'll see
gremlins in the machinery.

07:39.673 --> 07:41.675
Or little green men.

07:42.634 --> 07:48.306
Oh, the glider. No, that's
Mr. Osborn's TechFlight glider.

08:05.281 --> 08:08.034
All's I'm saying is I could
have cracked it open there.

08:08.201 --> 08:11.287
Cops would have cracked you open.
Cops or Spider-Man.

08:11.496 --> 08:13.707
Hammerhead's waiting
for the Big Man's cut.

08:13.873 --> 08:16.042
Forget the crowbar, blow it up.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.211
Blow yourself up.

08:21.047 --> 08:24.050
Did someone mention explosives?

08:24.217 --> 08:25.969
Get the freak.

08:34.894 --> 08:38.773
I meant get the freak
anything he wants.

08:38.982 --> 08:43.193
What I want is your undying loyalty.

08:43.403 --> 08:46.072
Or the dying kind.

08:46.239 --> 08:50.535
The Green Goblin
is nothing if not flexible.

08:59.085 --> 09:01.796
Appreciate the help,
but we work for the Big Man.

09:02.005 --> 09:05.425
We switch loyalties, and we might as
well tie on the toe tags ourselves.

09:05.592 --> 09:07.719
I'm good with knots too.

09:07.886 --> 09:12.223
As for the Big Man, the party's over.

09:32.619 --> 09:34.537
If I might have your attention.

09:34.746 --> 09:37.123
As many of you know,
I am your host...

09:37.332 --> 09:39.084
...L. Thompson Lincoln.

09:39.250 --> 09:43.963
Thank you all for coming to support
the Lincoln Dynamic Youth Center.

09:44.631 --> 09:46.633
Some shindig, eh, Johnny boy?

09:46.800 --> 09:49.219
It's great, Pop, but to be honest...

09:49.385 --> 09:53.139
...I was looking forward to it
just being you, me and a rare steak.

09:53.348 --> 09:55.809
Come on. Lincoln's got enough
of the Bugle's money.

09:55.975 --> 09:57.936
We can be at Luigi's in 88 seconds.

09:58.144 --> 10:01.981
Sorry. Elevator's out of order.
Stairs too.

10:02.232 --> 10:03.942
Of course, you could try a window.

10:10.323 --> 10:11.366
Too late.

10:13.409 --> 10:16.371
Hello. Good evening.

10:16.996 --> 10:19.499
I am the Green Goblin...

10:19.749 --> 10:24.170
...and I am looking for the Big Man.

10:24.420 --> 10:26.965
Sir, I don't know who you are, but--

10:27.173 --> 10:28.341
Of course you don't.

10:28.508 --> 10:30.802
That's the point of the mask, genius.

10:33.513 --> 10:36.641
But I know who you are, crime king.

10:36.850 --> 10:40.103
So step down
or I start sharing secrets.

10:40.311 --> 10:42.689
You're making an enormous mistake.

10:42.856 --> 10:46.025
Security. This man
is obviously troubled.

10:46.192 --> 10:47.318
Take care of him.

10:48.361 --> 10:51.823
Still hiding behind
an army of thugs, are we?

11:07.172 --> 11:09.632
Oh, he swings through the air...

11:09.799 --> 11:12.260
...dishing all kinds of fear.

11:12.468 --> 11:16.848
This daring goblin
on the big chandel-

11:19.058 --> 11:21.227
Pop, move. We have to--

11:21.394 --> 11:22.979
Johnny.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.610
Now, now. Stay put.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.486
Or else.

11:30.695 --> 11:33.489
There's no need
to threaten my guests.

11:33.698 --> 11:38.286
There is if I want witnesses, big guy.

11:38.536 --> 11:40.288
John?

11:40.496 --> 11:42.040
I'm okay, Pop.

11:45.919 --> 11:47.921
Robertson. Jonah?

11:48.087 --> 11:51.257
Jonah, slow down. A green what?

11:51.424 --> 11:54.093
Goblin. Green Goblin.
No, no reporter.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.597
I'll cover the story myself and save
a few bucks, but get me Parker.

11:57.764 --> 12:02.936
This is right up his freak-show alley.
Oh, and maybe call the police.

12:20.787 --> 12:23.623
- Killer look, girl.
- Thanks. I put it together myself.

12:23.790 --> 12:25.792
The top's from a thrift store on 22nd.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.543
You and I so need to hang.

12:27.752 --> 12:30.672
So, what do you think
of Midtown High?

12:30.922 --> 12:34.550
Doesn't look much different
from my school. Your basic brain pit.

12:38.263 --> 12:41.307
Well, we also have the top-ranked
theater magnet in the city.

12:41.474 --> 12:43.268
Theater magnet?

12:43.434 --> 12:45.937
I'm starting to feel the attraction.

12:46.104 --> 12:47.313
<i>That was the Bugle.</i>

12:47.480 --> 12:50.149
There's this maniac
terrorizing my boss and--

12:50.316 --> 12:52.277
Well, he wants me
to go shoot pictures...

12:52.443 --> 12:55.029
...and I kind of have to,
or he could fire me.

12:55.196 --> 12:57.323
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.826
But hustle back, tiger.

12:59.993 --> 13:03.037
- You owe me one more dance.
- Really? You're not ticked?

13:03.204 --> 13:04.789
That-- That's so cool.

13:04.956 --> 13:08.293
I won't be gone long, Red, I promise.

13:08.459 --> 13:10.503
Ditched by the King of the Geeks.

13:10.670 --> 13:13.798
- That must sting.
- Oh, painfully.

13:13.965 --> 13:17.385
But if I can't dance with Pete,
I guess I'll dance with...

13:17.593 --> 13:19.679
It's Randy, right?

13:19.846 --> 13:21.389
Very.

13:27.603 --> 13:29.689
What do you hope
to accomplish here tonight?

13:29.856 --> 13:32.358
So the whole wanting to
destroy you...

13:32.525 --> 13:35.903
...and take over your empire thing
wasn't clear?

13:36.112 --> 13:37.655
Well, darn.

13:39.032 --> 13:42.368
Excuse me. Can I come in this way
or do I have to break my own window?

13:42.535 --> 13:45.747
- Spider-Man.
- Your timing is impeccable.

13:45.997 --> 13:49.042
So your latest super-loser
turned on you, huh, Tombie?

13:49.208 --> 13:54.380
I don't know who he is yet,
but he's not in my employ.

13:54.547 --> 13:57.383
That's okay. I can pretend
he's yours while I trounce him.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.260
I'll still feel all warm inside.

13:59.510 --> 14:01.763
Hello. I'm in the room.

14:01.929 --> 14:04.766
Really, you're both too rude.

14:05.224 --> 14:06.351
Where are my manners?

14:06.517 --> 14:10.021
Here you come to terrorize Tombster,
and I don't even say thank you.

14:10.229 --> 14:13.900
My only excuse is that you're also
holding innocent people hostage.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.402
It's confusing to my poor
spider-brain.

14:17.278 --> 14:19.530
Yes, quite the puzzler...

14:19.697 --> 14:21.699
...but the Green Goblin
has a solution.

14:21.866 --> 14:24.202
You and I join forces.

14:24.369 --> 14:28.414
Consider what we could accomplish
by combining our powers.

14:28.581 --> 14:31.167
We could rule New York!

14:31.376 --> 14:35.254
We talking Manhattan or all five--?
No. Sorry.

14:35.421 --> 14:38.091
I make it a rule not to partner
with anyone green...

14:38.257 --> 14:40.051
...or, you know, psychotic.

14:40.218 --> 14:42.804
Oh, well. Your loss. Of life.

15:09.789 --> 15:12.625
Okay, where's the dude
with the nasty 'tude?

15:14.794 --> 15:17.588
Present and accounted for.

15:20.091 --> 15:22.009
If I might have your attention...

15:22.218 --> 15:25.012
...the votes are in for king
and queen of the ball.

15:25.221 --> 15:27.932
Your king is Flash Thompson.

15:28.099 --> 15:30.643
- That's my man.
- All right.

15:30.810 --> 15:33.354
- Get up there.
- All right, all right.

15:33.521 --> 15:34.647
And your queen is--

15:36.149 --> 15:38.985
"The red-haired girl
who came with Peter Parker"?

15:39.152 --> 15:41.988
-Is--? Is that right?
- Yeah.

15:42.655 --> 15:45.491
All right. Yeah.

15:52.832 --> 15:54.500
Okay, I know it's totally petty...

15:54.750 --> 15:59.881
...but seeing Peter's date crowned
alongside Flash makes me smile.

16:02.425 --> 16:05.887
May I see your invitation,
Spider-Man?

16:06.095 --> 16:09.182
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll
have to ask you to leave.

16:09.390 --> 16:12.185
Leave now? When Table 7
needs more hors d'oeuvres?

16:30.703 --> 16:32.413
Oh, did you want a ride?

16:32.580 --> 16:34.916
Keep our guests comfy, boys.

16:35.082 --> 16:37.960
I'll be back in a New York minute.

16:39.629 --> 16:42.256
Seriously, Gobby, do you have
a license for this thing?

16:48.638 --> 16:52.600
Don't panic, Spidey.
Still one web-shooter left.

16:53.059 --> 16:55.102
Okay, now you can panic.

17:03.903 --> 17:05.363
Web-shooters empty...

17:05.570 --> 17:08.366
...but I've learned never
to web-sling unprepared.

17:10.910 --> 17:14.955
Yes. Web-head, one, gravity, zero.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.257
You know the old saying:

17:24.423 --> 17:26.467
"if you can't join them, beat them."

17:26.925 --> 17:28.761
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

17:28.928 --> 17:31.264
- Is that a felony?
- I certainly hope so.

17:31.430 --> 17:33.391
This goblin
wouldn't be caught dead...

17:33.558 --> 17:37.228
-...committing a misdemeanor.
- Nice banter.

17:37.395 --> 17:40.523
- Aim still needs work.
- Well, practice makes perfect.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.400
Keep telling yourself that.

18:08.509 --> 18:11.762
That's for making me
protect Tombstone.

18:22.481 --> 18:25.651
Okay, wow. Just--

18:43.544 --> 18:44.629
Now what's so funny?

18:44.837 --> 18:47.673
Just the special fire
and brimstone pumpkin...

18:47.840 --> 18:51.969
...I left behind as a present
for our Mr. Lincoln.

18:52.178 --> 18:54.805
Any minute now
the créme de la créme...

18:54.972 --> 18:59.810
...of New York City
is going to paint the town red.

19:00.019 --> 19:02.855
Well, the ballroom, anyway.

19:07.818 --> 19:08.861
What are we to do?

19:09.028 --> 19:10.905
Keep everyone here
until he comes back.

19:11.072 --> 19:13.658
Or maybe evacuate
before the Goblin's bomb goes off.

19:13.866 --> 19:15.368
Clear the room.

19:19.872 --> 19:23.459
What are you doing? You have
to get out. Bad guys included.

19:24.669 --> 19:26.087
We work for the Goblin.

19:26.337 --> 19:28.089
Every single blasted
fragment of you?

19:28.339 --> 19:30.216
- You're bluffing.
- Is that a risk...

19:30.383 --> 19:31.759
...you're prepared to take?

19:32.009 --> 19:35.054
Especially when you've
already taken so many.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.516
Everybody down the stairs.

19:38.683 --> 19:41.560
If the bomb goes off,
the elevators won't be safe.

19:41.727 --> 19:44.230
Stay calm. Don't push.

19:46.399 --> 19:48.734
Go, Pop. I'm right behind you.

19:50.736 --> 19:54.573
Okay, if I were an evil pumpkin,
where would I hide?

20:00.204 --> 20:04.083
- I'm surprised you're sticking around.
- My party. My mess.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.879
<i>- This daring goblin on the big--</i>
- The <i>chandelier.</i>

20:10.256 --> 20:13.592
John, don't.
We can still get that steak.

20:15.386 --> 20:16.929
Spider-Man. Chandelier.

20:18.556 --> 20:20.766
Thanks. Now, go.

20:22.935 --> 20:26.522
We're going back down?
Now you're just torturing me.

20:44.832 --> 20:48.711
You know, applause from you
makes me wanna shower.

20:48.878 --> 20:51.005
Perhaps,
but someone should point out...

20:51.172 --> 20:53.257
...I offered you
a handsome salary to do...

20:53.424 --> 20:55.593
...just the sort of thing
you did tonight...

20:55.801 --> 20:59.472
...and instead you've done
the Big Man's business for free.

20:59.972 --> 21:05.144
That, my heroic friend,
is what grownups call irony.

21:09.565 --> 21:11.150
Robbie, I got your headline:

21:11.317 --> 21:13.819
"Colonel John Jameson
saves New York's elite--"

21:13.986 --> 21:18.157
Dad, there'll be an investigation,
they could scrub me from the mission.

21:18.491 --> 21:20.117
Robbie? Scratch that headline.

21:20.284 --> 21:23.662
Give the credit to Spider-Man.
To Spider-Man, confound it!

21:23.829 --> 21:26.332
But fire Parker.
The kid never showed up.

21:26.499 --> 21:30.461
What? What do you mean
he just e-mailed photos?

21:35.633 --> 21:37.885
See, Glory, you're so selfish.

21:38.135 --> 21:40.513
Everyone knows don't
dump the guy with the limo--

21:40.679 --> 21:43.849
Nothing personal, Kenny.
--until the day after the dance.

21:44.183 --> 21:46.644
Where is Osborn, anyway?

22:06.664 --> 22:09.208
Nice, Pete. You blew it.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.417
Again.

22:10.626 --> 22:12.545
I wouldn't say that.

22:12.711 --> 22:15.381
I saved the last dance for you, tiger.
