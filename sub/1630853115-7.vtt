WEBVTT

00:23.732 --> 00:26.151
<i>A broken-hearted bride-to-be.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:31.614
<i>A royal wedding in shambles.</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:34.868
<i>Sensational? Quite.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:36.828
<i>But true?</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:43.501
<i>This author may traffic</i>
<i>in chatter and speculation, dear reader,</i>

00:44.419 --> 00:47.505
<i>but misinformation? </i>

00:48.840 --> 00:49.883
<i>Never.</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:56.181
<i>Explanations of why Miss Edwina</i>
<i>absconded from the altar</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:59.893
<i>may be greater in number</i>
<i>than anyone could possibly fathom.</i>

01:00.602 --> 01:04.814
<i>But we must not forget,</i>
<i>it was Her Majesty the Queen</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:08.193
<i>who placed the young miss</i>
<i>on that special stage</i>

01:08.276 --> 01:11.237
<i>so that she could make her grand exit.</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:15.784
<i>Allow this author to hope…</i>

01:15.867 --> 01:17.035
My carriage.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.079
<i>…for Her Majesty's sake,</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:23.083
<i>as well as both</i>
<i>the Sharmas and Bridgertons,</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:26.878
<i>that an official explanation</i>
<i>emerges swiftly,</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:32.842
<i>lest the ton are run away</i>
<i>by their tawdry imaginings.</i>

02:10.338 --> 02:12.590
Miss? The baths are ready.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.404
I'm finished.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.929
You should try the lily soap today.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.099
It is good for the nerves.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.217
Where is your brother?
He should be here by now.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.178
Perhaps he is still waiting
at the altar for Miss Edwina.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.804
There will be no mockery today.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.097
She mocks me incessantly.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.726
Are we not overlooking
the benefit of this… tragedy?

03:46.809 --> 03:48.519
-Leftover cake?
-You wonder why I mock you?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.688
Brother! How good of you to join us.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.900
-Have you all eaten?
-You will need to break your fast later.

03:53.983 --> 03:58.613
For now, it is of the utmost importance
that we act swiftly to

03:58.696 --> 04:00.531
limit the damaging consequences

04:00.615 --> 04:02.450
of the unfortunate events of your--

04:02.533 --> 04:03.910
Bungled nuptials?

04:03.993 --> 04:07.705
Is all of this truly happening
because a woman merely changed her mind?

04:07.789 --> 04:10.833
Unfortunately so, Eloise. Yet,
I suppose the reason does not signify.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.794
We simply must deal with the consequences.

04:12.877 --> 04:16.589
Now, I think it
a pleasant morning for promenade.

04:17.674 --> 04:22.345
Together, united, as the most respectable
family that we still very much are.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.513
Respectable?

04:25.348 --> 04:28.726
A respectable family is
headed by a gentleman, is it not?

04:29.435 --> 04:32.480
Brother…
Is there something more we should know?

04:32.563 --> 04:35.441
Or, perhaps, more than just I should know?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.444
Forgive me.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.198
If a promenade is
what you feel is wise, Mother,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.783
then we shall leave within the hour.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.787
I shall be a little late. Shopping.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.789
I need a new pair of gloves,

04:49.872 --> 04:53.293
so as to look that much more
united and respectable.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.553
Oh, never mind the heavy cloaks.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.306
I will be quite sweltering
where we are going shopping

05:07.015 --> 05:07.932
in town.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.737
Miss Bridgerton.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.792
Straight into the fire.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.753
A favorite pastime of mine.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.547
Now, remember,
it was a mutual understanding

05:39.630 --> 05:43.551
about a private matter
between Miss Edwina and the viscount.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.971
That is all we are to say on the subject.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.556
Good day, Lord Fife.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.640
For some of us.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.396
Is this truly our plan?
Simply to pretend nothing has happened?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.648
We are not pretending
nothing has happened.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.152
We are choosing to deal with it
in private, in our own time.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.779
Scandals may cast aspersions,

06:02.862 --> 06:05.239
but they do not obligate us
to answer to anyone.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.409
Besides, the ton
has a remarkably short memory.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.119
With any luck, by this time next week,

06:10.203 --> 06:13.873
there will be a bigger story for them
to sink their rapacious teeth into.

06:13.956 --> 06:18.002
We may find you a husband
this season still, Miss Edwina.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.546
I give credit
to your imagination, Lady Danbury.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.507
A bigger story I cannot foresee.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.731
Hmm.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.401
Don't look.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.990
Miss Patridge.
Such a pleasant afternoon, is it not?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.784
Yes, indeed, my lord.

06:49.867 --> 06:53.287
My dear, I believe we will be late
for the Gorings. Make haste.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.597
Is this not a surprise,

07:11.681 --> 07:14.058
to see you out in public,
Lady Bridgerton, so soon?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.769
Lady Featherington, it is not
as though we are in mourning.

07:16.853 --> 07:20.731
No one understands the pain
of a broken engagement better than myself.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.567
I never thought we would recover

07:22.650 --> 07:25.570
after Mr. Bridgerton
and Miss Thompson's falling out,

07:25.653 --> 07:27.155
and yet here we are.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.073
Miss Thompson now Lady Crane,

07:29.157 --> 07:32.910
Philippa now Mrs. Finch,
and Prudence now engaged.

07:32.994 --> 07:37.331
Yes. It is rather amusing
how things work themselves out, is it not?

07:37.415 --> 07:41.961
Indeed. I do wish you good fortune
with all of your things, Lady Bridgerton.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.927
We are truly sorry, Lady Bridgerton.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.307
Come along, Penelope.
We don't want to talk their ears off.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.449
It's a beautiful carriage,
Your Majesty.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.911
Your horses must be strong
to pull all of this gold.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.954
What were you doing
visiting that printer shop

08:17.038 --> 08:19.957
in the middle
of your brother's so-called wedding?

08:21.292 --> 08:22.919
-Oh.
-I know it is you.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
Lady Whistledown herself.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.882
Oh, Your Majesty--

08:27.965 --> 08:30.718
Your denial shall only
enhance your punishment.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.596
You were quite clever, Miss Bridgerton.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.183
Why, just last season, I recruited you
to uncover the writer's identity,

08:37.266 --> 08:39.435
and you, rather conveniently,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.604
found not one credible suspect.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.940
I am not clever enough
to manipulate Your Majesty.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.652
Is it not curious that you are
so rarely mentioned in those pages?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.364
I also hear you have
a great distaste for society,

08:51.447 --> 08:53.491
just as the writer herself does.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.203
You do realize the power you wield
in that pen of yours can be used

08:57.286 --> 09:01.499
for greater purposes
than ridicule and gossip-mongering, yes?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.753
Lady Whistledown could be
a strategic ally to the Crown,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.089
should she so please.

09:08.172 --> 09:11.801
And I would gladly help, ma'am,
but I wield no such power, I assure you.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.095
So,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.514
you would rather be my rival?

09:17.181 --> 09:21.018
Have you any idea what will happen
once I reveal this secret of yours, child?

09:22.144 --> 09:24.522
People will seek their revenge.

09:25.356 --> 09:29.068
However bad your family's
situation seems to you now,

09:30.403 --> 09:31.904
it will only get worse.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.158
I might be able to solve that problem.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.954
I shall give you three days

09:40.037 --> 09:42.665
to consider my proposal
and come to your senses.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.917
If you do not,

09:45.501 --> 09:49.213
then I will deploy my resources
to crush you like a serpent.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.886
Pride may not be
as precious to you as your breath.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.774
Lady Cowper.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.823
Lady Eaton.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.578
Oh, Lord Hall.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.999
Lord Cho.

10:42.183 --> 10:46.020
After everything that happened
with his scullery maid last season,

10:46.103 --> 10:48.689
and Lord Cho cuts me?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.524
We know what we are
to deal with, at least.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.943
We shall not remove ourselves
from this fight.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.154
All will be lost if we run now.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.365
I should like to remove myself
from this room.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.285
Every day that goes by

11:01.369 --> 11:05.122
without our altering
the ton-shared sentiment will harden it.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.417
Perhaps we need
another story as to why things ended.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.046
We have already started to tell one.
We cannot change course now.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.881
If we cannot speak about the reasons,

11:13.964 --> 11:17.343
might we at least act as though
they are of no consequence to us?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.679
A ball.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.140
Yes. Together. We prove
to the ton that our story is true.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.143
It was indeed a mutual decision
between all interested parties,

11:26.227 --> 11:29.647
and there is no scandal or ill will
between our families at all.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.065
Hmm.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.152
A ball would give Edwina
another chance to find a suitor.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.529
Another ball?

11:37.154 --> 11:41.117
So that the ton might inspect
this wreckage with an even closer eye?

11:44.745 --> 11:46.580
A ball may very well work.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.000
After all, the viscount
and my sister have been so good

11:50.084 --> 11:53.212
at hiding their true feelings
from everyone in public this far.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.340
It should not trouble them
to do the same a little longer.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.717
Edwina…

12:00.636 --> 12:03.514
-Ugh, Newton.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.016
Oh, Newton. My apologies.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.102
Newton, out. Out. Newton, out.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.655
Was I truly that blind?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.617
Were they always this obvious?

12:23.701 --> 12:24.952
If this plan is to work…

12:25.035 --> 12:28.956
I suggest the two of you stay on
opposite sides of the room at all times.

12:29.039 --> 12:29.957
Lady Danbury!

12:30.040 --> 12:33.544
All we need would be for someone
to witness something untoward--

12:33.627 --> 12:37.173
I beg your pardon, Lady Danbury.
I do not know what you mean to say.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.341
What she means to say,
is that those of us in this room

12:39.425 --> 12:42.344
at present are the only ones
who know the full truth of the matter.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.972
And we would
prefer to keep it that way.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.599
As should you.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.811
If there is so much
as a passing look between the two of you,

12:50.895 --> 12:54.190
then this plan of ours
will be for nothing.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.816
Are we all in agreement?

12:57.985 --> 12:58.903
Of course.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.698
Quite, Lady Danbury.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.006
Anthony.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.092
Anthony.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.807
Is this plan
going to be a problem for you?

13:27.890 --> 13:28.724
Mother--

13:28.808 --> 13:31.352
I ask because of what happened
the last time you found yourself

13:31.435 --> 13:32.978
in such close proximity to Miss Sharma.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.565
We'd not be in this situation if--

13:36.649 --> 13:39.902
You have nothing to worry about.
I will play the part.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.615
And then?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.746
This plan…

13:51.872 --> 13:54.875
Well, it is a temporary solution.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.088
If it is successful, of course,
the rumors of scandal will die.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.550
Yet, no matter what,
it still leaves you with no one to marry.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.762
Unless your designs
for the season have changed?

14:06.846 --> 14:09.682
You do realize it is still possible
for our family to endure

14:09.765 --> 14:12.935
whether I decide to marry or not?
This line does not end with me.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.771
No. No, it does not, but--

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
Are you to rely on
your brothers as your solution?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.568
Do you need me to admit
I made a mistake? Is that what you want?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.612
To tell you I never should've asked
Miss Edwina for her hand?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
That I never should've
taken things this far? I realize.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.078
I realize I have indeed failed

14:31.161 --> 14:33.789
at more things
than you and Father will ever know.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.710
This plan will work.

14:37.793 --> 14:42.131
I am… quite certain both you
and Lady Danbury will make sure of it.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.281
You saved them all?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.703
You must have, what,
every issue ever printed.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.789
Double that.
There are two copies here of every one.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.125
-Eloise, why ever--
-The queen thinks it is me.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.754
-That I am Lady Whistledown.
-Are you being humorous?

15:21.837 --> 15:25.257
She has given me three days to confess.
She is threatening my family, Pen.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.178
I should get rid of these. If the queen
discovers I have all of these,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.180
it will only make me appear
that much more guilty.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.725
But you are not guilty.
El, this is a terrible mistake.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.311
We will somehow
arrange to see Her Majesty.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.146
We must implore her to listen to reason.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.565
Oh yes, because Her Majesty
has always been so reasonable.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.400
But why would the queen think it is you?

15:44.026 --> 15:47.321
Yes, you are outspoken
and opinionated and--

15:47.404 --> 15:48.989
One of her footmen saw me visiting Theo.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.702
I know. I should have listened to you.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.873
I was selfish, and now I may have
even put Theo into harm's way too.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.167
The queen must think he has
something to do with Whistledown.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.503
But he does not, and neither have you.
El, this is madness.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.005
-I should warn him.
-No. No, you should not.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.259
You should stay as far away from Theo
and that print shop as you can.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.930
You should wait for Lady Whistledown
to print her next issue.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.558
Then, with any luck, you can use that
in order to prove your innocence.

16:38.622 --> 16:40.290
I must speak with Madame Delacroix.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.878
-You should not be here.
-It is urgent. Please.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.181
Her Majesty the Queen is now involved?

16:56.265 --> 16:58.100
She always has been, I suppose.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.020
I gather she has felt threatened
by Whistledown for quite some time.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.648
I have questioned Her Majesty's taste,
challenged her judgment.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.068
That was not part of our agreement.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.363
Our businesses both
reaped substantial rewards.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.241
You understood
our arrangement came with risks.

17:14.908 --> 17:19.329
Yes, but that did not involve
the Queen of England.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.253
I was hoping you would've
heard something in your shop.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.923
Something to satisfy Her Majesty.
A way to give her what she clearly wants.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.593
Admiration, favor, praise.

17:33.093 --> 17:36.680
Uh, you are to tell me
you could not think of something yourself?

17:38.515 --> 17:40.017
I do not know what to do.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.354
My best friend is
in trouble because of me, and

17:44.938 --> 17:46.565
I do not know what to do.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.276
You could turn yourself in.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.403
Take Miss Eloise's place.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.656
Only, Her Majesty would
need to believe you, of course.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.533
Well, I cannot be certain she would.

17:57.326 --> 18:00.704
Her Majesty would merely dismiss me
as a friend trying to help a friend.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.456
That's if she would even see me at all.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.843
They are quite beautiful.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.803
Hmm.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.346
-Your designs.
-Ah.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.848
I was hoping to submit them

18:19.932 --> 18:22.684
to a revered house
of dressmakers in France.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.522
Take my business to a higher rank.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.608
Though, now I may be aiding and abetting

18:29.691 --> 18:32.402
the most notorious
gossip writer in London.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.117
I will ensure your name remains unsullied.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.911
You have my word.

18:44.998 --> 18:45.916
I should go.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.418
I am sorry I disturbed you.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.427
The one thing a lady would never do

18:58.137 --> 19:01.807
is wear something she knows
makes her look ugly, Miss Penelope.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.601
Were you to write
something about Miss Eloise

19:04.685 --> 19:06.478
she would never write about herself.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.564
Well,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.609
I do not need to tell you
what that might make the queen believe.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.528
I could never do that.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.281
I could never ruin my friend.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.993
Of course not.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.122
Good night.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.163
Brother. I did not know
you'd be stopping by tonight.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.331
Neither did I.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.833
The Royal Schools seem to be providing

20:09.917 --> 20:12.211
a different sort of education
than what I had pictured.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.421
Or perhaps, exactly as I had pictured.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.839
Can I-- Can I get you a drink?

20:15.923 --> 20:17.716
Is there somewhere
we can go that is quieter?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.178
It is a party, Brother.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.513
It is something.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.393
Do you do this every night?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.605
Did you come to admonish me?

20:31.688 --> 20:35.275
I only mean to say
you may be a second son, Brother,

20:35.359 --> 20:38.028
but that does not exempt you
from familial duty altogether.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.655
It merely makes you second.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.077
Does this have to do with whatever is
truly going on with you and the Sharmas?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.578
Particularly the eldest?

20:46.662 --> 20:49.539
Mother is not the only one
who sees the way you look at her.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.168
How long do you plan
on punishing yourself for,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.170
and wallowing in such misery?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.090
Forget I came.
Have a good night, Benedict.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.510
Look, no.
Things may seem bleak now, Brother.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.888
But if I'm learning anything
from my art studies,

21:04.972 --> 21:08.850
it's that it is almost always
a matter of… perspective.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.436
I look at my art,

21:12.813 --> 21:15.774
and if I do not like what I see,

21:15.857 --> 21:17.776
I may always alter the color palette,

21:17.859 --> 21:21.029
but I certainly do not toss
the entire design aside.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.324
Perhaps you, too,
could do the same in your own life.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.287
Back to taking the tea, are we?

21:30.956 --> 21:32.624
At least just shave, will you?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.696
-Lady Danbury.
-Hmm.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.073
-Lady Mary.
-Thank you.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.241
Miss Sharma.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.705
Miss Edwina, I…

22:19.087 --> 22:21.465
How thoughtful of you, Lord Bridgerton.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.843
Now, remember,
before we are to send out our invitations,

22:24.926 --> 22:27.596
we must appear
to be enjoying each other's company.

22:28.096 --> 22:28.972
Shall we?

23:23.777 --> 23:25.904
Do not be deterred.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.573
If we can put the wedding
behind us, so can they.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.632
You must forgive me, Lady Mary.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.301
I have yet formally to apologize.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.887
It is not exactly a surprise.

23:50.971 --> 23:54.558
Men often take time to realize
their culpability in such matters.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.852
It is quite the privilege, is it not?

24:00.522 --> 24:02.274
You have every reason to scorn me.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.443
But I would be very much remiss

24:04.526 --> 24:06.945
if I did not tell you
it was not my intention ever

24:07.028 --> 24:10.157
to cause your family
as much strife as I now know I have done.

24:12.117 --> 24:16.413
In truth, I cannot place blame
entirely at your door, Lord Bridgerton.

24:17.747 --> 24:20.459
I myself have been absent
for far too long.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.212
When my husband died, it should've been me
taking on my family's burden,

24:24.296 --> 24:25.338
not Kate.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.925
She sacrificed
far too much for us, indeed.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.096
Lady Hood. How good to see you today.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.764
And you, Lady Mary.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.684
And Lord Bridgerton too.

24:37.767 --> 24:38.602
Yes.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.138
Mr. Mondrich.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.723
Featherington.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.267
I'll, uh, take a brandy.

25:24.814 --> 25:27.400
Um, not exactly
the kind of welcome I was expecting.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.403
Forgive me, my lord?

25:30.487 --> 25:33.573
I was hoping for the owner
of this fine establishment to regale me

25:33.657 --> 25:34.950
with many stories, indeed.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.785
Of his boxing days, perhaps?

25:36.868 --> 25:39.704
Truth be told, I never really
enjoyed the sport myself.

25:39.788 --> 25:42.082
Boxing is not for all to enjoy.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.627
It requires a strong stomach
and an even stronger jaw.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.128
Hmm.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.172
A rather interesting assertion.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.884
My cousin had neither,
but Lord Featherington,

25:52.968 --> 25:54.386
may God rest his soul,

25:54.469 --> 25:56.763
was quite an admirer of yours, I've heard.

25:57.305 --> 26:00.725
I am honored.
Though his regard was unknown to me.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.563
Surely, your paths must have crossed.
He attended many bouts.

26:04.646 --> 26:08.692
Yes, well, I likely was preoccupied
with the fight at hand.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.195
It is dangerous
to become distracted in the ring.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.365
Of course. Dangerous in your occupation.

26:15.448 --> 26:19.828
But my cousin did keep
meticulous records of all debts, and

26:21.037 --> 26:22.163
wagers.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.877
I just came across
a rather significant one myself.

26:29.671 --> 26:34.175
I do not wish to defend myself
against baseless accusations, my lord.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.094
And I do not wish you to do so.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.179
I respect a self-made man,

26:38.263 --> 26:41.057
no matter what means he uses
to make himself.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.519
I will ask no more questions
of you than you ask of me.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.313
Baseless accusations, I cannot imagine,

26:46.396 --> 26:48.481
would be good
for either of our businesses.

26:48.565 --> 26:51.151
And, from the looks of it,

26:51.234 --> 26:53.778
you might need
all the help you can get with yours.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.167
Master printer's gone for the day.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.210
You'll have to come back.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.589
It is not printing I wish to solicit.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.384
Are you mad?

27:16.926 --> 27:17.761
What?

27:19.179 --> 27:20.013
What?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.600
Not even a little excited to see me, then?

27:23.683 --> 27:26.394
People from the palace
have been asking about me.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.937
I was almost thrown out today.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.441
Yes.
I think that may be my fault.

27:31.524 --> 27:34.069
The queen, she… she saw me
visiting you the other day

27:34.152 --> 27:36.571
and now believes me
to be Lady Whistledown herself.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.031
Ridiculous, yes?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.325
What is ridiculous is the fact

27:40.408 --> 27:42.535
that you thought it wise
to come back here again.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.705
-Come for more books, did you?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.290
What?

27:47.916 --> 27:51.086
No. I came to make sure
you were all right,

27:51.169 --> 27:52.921
to get our story straight.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.214
Our story?

27:58.009 --> 28:00.136
This is not the least bit surprising.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.681
What is that supposed to mean?

28:02.764 --> 28:06.476
That you are a lady who's never had to
endure any real difficulties in your life.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.229
You may have
the protection of your family,

28:09.312 --> 28:10.939
of your society, but I'm…

28:13.149 --> 28:14.025
I do not.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.946
You took your pleasure
from low life, Miss Bridgerton.

28:18.029 --> 28:21.491
Now I think it best you return to Mayfair
before you get me into any more trouble.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.070
It seems both Miss Cowper and Miss Goring

28:59.154 --> 29:02.407
are swallowing the story
about the wedding being halted due to

29:02.490 --> 29:04.451
a mutual decision.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.289
That is good.

29:09.956 --> 29:13.334
Well… I appear to be a very good liar.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.963
Something else you and the viscount
have taught me, perhaps.

29:17.964 --> 29:18.923
Edwina,

29:19.674 --> 29:21.551
what will it take for you to forgive me?

29:22.343 --> 29:25.597
If I must apologize every day
for the rest of my life, I will.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.601
Your happiness is all
that has mattered to me, Bon,

29:29.684 --> 29:30.977
and now, believe me,

29:32.061 --> 29:34.981
I am reaping
the consequences of destroying it.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.489
I remember the books you used
to read to me from Appa's library.

29:42.572 --> 29:46.326
The stories of true love
and happy endings against all odds.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.621
Did you yourself ever truly believe them?

29:49.704 --> 29:51.873
Or has everything you told me been a lie?

29:51.956 --> 29:54.083
Of course I believe in true love.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.504
Of course I believe in happy endings.
How could I not?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.508
You saw Appa and Mama,
how happy they once were.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.677
What I saw is how
even that ended in tragedy.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.431
Happy endings do not exist, Kate.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.809
At least not in real life.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.763
Miss Sharma.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.725
I've been wishing
for a moment to be alone with you.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.019
To speak.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.188
There is nothing to speak about, my lord.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.568
-We kissed.
-We did not.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.238
Nothing happened between us.

31:06.614 --> 31:07.448
How could it?

31:08.867 --> 31:12.662
You were my sister's intended.
There is no world in which we could kiss.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.876
Are you quite serious?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.629
We did a terrible thing.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.389
We should be ashamed of what we did.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.942
Oh.
Lady Danbury. Lady Bridgerton.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.153
What a surprise to see you here.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.364
You do know my family
has its very own room here,

31:48.448 --> 31:49.908
yes, Lady Cowper?

31:49.991 --> 31:51.367
Over there, is it not?

31:51.451 --> 31:54.412
The one with the, uh… Danbury name

31:54.495 --> 31:57.123
just above the door.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.501
How nice it is to see you both.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.046
Though I'd have thought
you required a respite after

32:03.129 --> 32:04.797
the strenuous events of the past week.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.007
Oh, on the contrary.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.635
Well, I myself am hosting
a ball later this week.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.346
Have you not received an invitation?

32:11.429 --> 32:12.847
-Oh.
-My. Well…

32:12.931 --> 32:14.766
I will see if there is still room.

32:14.849 --> 32:17.101
We shall have a full house, no doubt.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.856
You truly are
a Jack of all trades.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.150
When one is in such wild country,

33:06.234 --> 33:07.944
one sometimes must do wild things.

33:08.945 --> 33:10.738
But if I'd not gone
on that hunting expedition,

33:10.822 --> 33:12.281
I'd never have discovered my mines.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.783
Huh. Ah.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.327
-The lady of the hour.
-Colin.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.662
Cousin Jack.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.247
I was just telling Lord Featherington

33:19.330 --> 33:22.375
that my interest in his mines
was sparked quite naturally

33:22.458 --> 33:25.461
when I viewed that exquisite necklace
you wore to my brother's wedding.

33:26.004 --> 33:26.838
Was it?

33:27.505 --> 33:29.340
You make a compelling case, Bridgerton.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.759
Allow me to give it some consideration.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.386
I shall eagerly await your response.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.639
The rest of the ton is dazzled
by your exploits. I only wish to be too.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.686
Would you see me out?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.315
I did not know
you fancied yourself an investor.

33:46.399 --> 33:49.861
No. Even I did not.
Yet, I am beginning to think differently.

33:50.611 --> 33:54.323
I know it is a large sum to risk,
but I am sorely tempted.

33:54.991 --> 33:58.244
It is a chance to make a name for myself,
as your cousin has done.

33:58.911 --> 34:02.498
And once our profits come,
both our families will benefit,

34:02.582 --> 34:04.876
which is just what makes it so enticing.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.127
You think highly of my family?

34:06.210 --> 34:09.297
I am not in the habit of consorting
with those I hold in low esteem.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.257
I never thought of it like that.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.467
I understand.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.596
Our relationship has taken shape
so naturally over the years,

34:16.679 --> 34:18.264
one could take it for granted.

34:19.432 --> 34:21.017
You have always been so

34:21.726 --> 34:24.228
constant and loyal, Pen.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.441
I do not believe I deserve
such praise for my loyalty.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.819
Does something trouble you?

34:32.862 --> 34:33.780
No, not at all.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.077
Oh. I almost forgot.

34:39.160 --> 34:42.205
Perhaps I might rely on
your loyalty one last time.

34:42.288 --> 34:45.500
Until this agreement
with your cousin is confirmed,

34:45.583 --> 34:48.086
I do not wish for word
to get back to Anthony.

34:48.711 --> 34:52.298
Could you avoid telling anyone?
Especially Eloise.

34:52.381 --> 34:54.801
I know there are no secrets
between you two, but--

34:54.884 --> 34:56.511
Mr. Bridgerton.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.099
I did not know we had a caller today.

35:02.558 --> 35:05.770
Miss Penelope was just seeing me out.
While I have been talking her to death

35:05.853 --> 35:09.148
about matters so foolish I'd have
blushed to share them with anyone else.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.660
-Mr. Bridgerton.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.709
Need I remind you of our discussion
about who is and is not

35:28.793 --> 35:30.670
to invest in our business?

35:31.254 --> 35:33.714
I love it when you call it <i>our</i> business.

35:35.174 --> 35:38.678
I tried to dissuade Mr. Bridgerton,
but the lad is quite persistent.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.347
Despite his family situation,
he seems fixed on it.

35:41.430 --> 35:44.475
Because it is precisely
that situation that is prompting him.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.894
He is not foolish in wanting
to come to an agreement now

35:46.978 --> 35:51.357
before everyone wishes to stop associating
with him and his family altogether.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.653
More bills, Mrs. Varley?

35:55.736 --> 35:59.657
Invitations, my lord.
And there are quite a few.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.909
And why should there not be?

36:05.913 --> 36:07.915
-Look at that one.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.877
The invitations are ready
to be distributed, ma'am.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.503
Oh, excellent, Mrs. Wilson.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.256
Oh, dear little Augie is
still suffering from his cough,

36:15.339 --> 36:17.675
so the duchess
will naturally not be able to attend.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.094
But that is precisely
why it is so important

36:20.178 --> 36:22.847
that the rest of us
embrace this theme of harmony…

36:28.811 --> 36:31.272
…and work together to impress our guests.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.401
If we garner enough support,
the queen may even be swayed

36:35.484 --> 36:37.445
to forget all about this wedding business.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.453
-It is positively suffocating in here.
-Eloise, dear?

36:47.079 --> 36:48.581
Are you feeling unwell?

36:49.999 --> 36:52.710
Do not fret, Mama.
I'll still be in attendance at your ball.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.004
Participating in this farce
along with the rest of us.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.798
I am doing this for all of us.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.468
Perhaps there is still time
to change your theme.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.139
Has there truly been
no Whistledown delivery today?

37:07.975 --> 37:09.393
Good day, Bridgertons.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.293
-I am going to confess.
-What?

37:34.377 --> 37:36.420
I know all I need to know
about Whistledown.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.923
I shall find a printer,
publish a counterfeit paper,

37:39.006 --> 37:41.801
and give Her Majesty
exactly what she wants. An ally.

37:41.884 --> 37:44.220
And you'll use the assistance
of that apprentice, Mr. Sharpe.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.555
I do not wish to speak
of that boy ever again.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.225
I am doing this
for my family, Pen.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.019
I make the queen,
once more, our supporter.

37:52.103 --> 37:55.690
It'll make the rest of society overlook
all the scandal we've recently caused.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.359
Eloise, I do not wish you
to do anything rash.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.152
There is little sand
left in this hourglass.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.446
If I have to say I am Whistledown,
then so be it.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.074
That'll only last for so long.
You cannot continue lying like that.

38:05.157 --> 38:06.367
What will happen…

38:08.703 --> 38:11.497
What will happen when the real
Lady Whistledown decides to publish again?

38:11.580 --> 38:14.375
I no longer care
what the real Lady Whistledown does,

38:14.458 --> 38:16.502
or does not, decide to do.
She is dead to me.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.879
Pen, I have made my decision.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.757
At the very least,
it will allow me a little more time to

38:21.841 --> 38:25.303
finally find the real writer
and make her pay for all of her crimes.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.097
I only wish to thank you.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.809
For always being such a loyal friend,

38:31.892 --> 38:33.769
whatever the circumstances.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.600
<i>What is it</i>
<i>about betrayal that excites us so?</i>

39:17.313 --> 39:21.525
<i>The ton itself has certainly felt</i>
<i>its peculiar kind of frenzy</i>

39:21.609 --> 39:26.405
<i>after the promise of the wedding</i>
<i>to end all weddings was broken.</i>

39:29.825 --> 39:33.829
<i>Yet this author has it</i>
<i>on very good authority</i>

39:33.913 --> 39:36.207
<i>that the viscount's failed nuptials</i>

39:36.290 --> 39:38.417
<i>may not be the only betrayal</i>

39:38.501 --> 39:41.962
<i>our dear Bridgertons</i>
<i>must manage at present.</i>

39:53.432 --> 39:54.433
Hmm.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.371
Well,

40:15.996 --> 40:17.957
this is unexpected.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.836
It is still quite early, I suppose.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.591
-Would you still like us to play, my lady?
-That will not be necessary.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.349
If there’s no need for my presence,
I’ll head to my studio.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.393
I do not wish to be around
such misery all evening.

40:37.476 --> 40:38.769
-Wait.
-I know of your opinions.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.146
You will stay for a dance.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.400
There shall be dancing.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.279
A new perspective, yes?

40:49.113 --> 40:50.448
Dancing? With whom?

40:50.531 --> 40:51.490
Anthony.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.243
Hyacinth!

40:54.910 --> 40:56.120
Yes, Brother?

40:58.747 --> 41:00.499
Come down here and do me the honor.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.335
If she gets to dance, so do I.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.136
Come.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.889
Show this dowager
the benefit of all these lessons

41:14.972 --> 41:17.141
I hear you've been taking, Mr. Bridgerton.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.601
He's much better than me, I'll say.

41:18.684 --> 41:22.021
Something lively.
A country dance, perhaps?

41:23.355 --> 41:27.359
I believe the theme you have
chosen tonight is harmony, Mother.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.182
Come on!

42:02.686 --> 42:04.980
-Hey! Hey!

42:27.002 --> 42:27.878
Whoo!

42:58.117 --> 42:59.368
Perhaps a quadrille?

42:59.868 --> 43:01.203
Uh…

43:02.371 --> 43:04.957
Perhaps we should
start eating some of that food.

43:06.709 --> 43:07.585
Yes.

43:15.634 --> 43:18.679
Given the ton's usual gullibility,

43:18.762 --> 43:21.140
I must admit, I am rather surprised

43:21.223 --> 43:24.226
they did not give credit
to our story, Lady Danbury.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.477
Whatever happened?

43:28.731 --> 43:30.608
Perhaps we should ask them.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.360
Mrs. Wilson?

43:33.861 --> 43:35.571
Is something wrong?

43:37.406 --> 43:39.408
It was just delivered, ma'am.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.705
Is that Lady Whistledown?

43:46.165 --> 43:47.708
Has she published, Mama?

43:47.791 --> 43:49.752
Indeed, she has.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.588
And now we may know
why we are the only ones here.

43:53.839 --> 43:56.592
<i>Should our lives be distilled down</i>

43:56.675 --> 43:59.386
<i>to the sum total of our choices,</i>

43:59.470 --> 44:04.224
<i>then Miss Eloise Bridgerton</i>
<i>has certainly made a dangerous,</i>

44:04.308 --> 44:06.852
<i>perhaps ruinous one.</i>

44:07.978 --> 44:10.397
<i>For she's apparently been associating,</i>

44:10.481 --> 44:14.151
<i>unchaperoned, with improper company.</i>

44:15.194 --> 44:18.322
<i>Political radicals, in fact.</i>

44:30.751 --> 44:32.169
You seem happy, my lady.

44:32.252 --> 44:35.673
It seems our neighbors are to remain
afflicted for quite some time.

44:37.132 --> 44:41.136
Colin Bridgerton, go ahead.
Seal the agreement with him.

44:46.350 --> 44:50.270
<i>It might be that</i>
<i>the young miss spent a great deal of time</i>

44:50.354 --> 44:51.939
<i>considering her decisions.</i>

44:52.022 --> 44:53.023
<i>Or,</i>

44:53.899 --> 44:56.777
<i>perhaps, they were made in haste.</i>

45:12.000 --> 45:16.004
<i>Whatever the case may be,</i>
<i>we all must remember,</i>

45:16.088 --> 45:18.757
<i>as one makes one's bed,</i>

45:18.841 --> 45:21.510
<i>so one must lie in it.</i>

45:28.934 --> 45:30.686
Might we return home, Bon?

45:31.437 --> 45:33.439
As if you truly care
what I would like to do.

45:33.522 --> 45:34.732
Edwina, this is cruelty--

45:34.815 --> 45:38.777
Do not dare…
try to make me out to be the cruel one.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.906
I may not know who I truly am,

45:43.449 --> 45:46.827
but at least I know
I am kinder-hearted than you.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.327
What are you doing out here?

46:30.829 --> 46:32.498
-My apologies.
-No, no, please. Stay.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.582
You were here first.

46:33.665 --> 46:35.501
-I was just leaving.
-It is your house, my lord.

46:36.418 --> 46:38.712
-It does not signify--
-Perhaps it should.

46:39.671 --> 46:41.465
-Must you always?
-You were the one insisting.

46:41.548 --> 46:43.967
-And this is you compromising?
-Good night, my lord.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.219
Can you ever just agree?

46:49.640 --> 46:52.935
You have been like this from the moment
we first met in those woods.

46:53.018 --> 46:55.562
Obstinate, inflexible,

46:55.646 --> 46:58.607
unyielding to good, plain common sense.

46:58.690 --> 47:02.611
Well, I can certainly understand why that
would be so troubling for a man like you.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.697
A man used to always getting his way.

47:05.781 --> 47:07.783
-A man used to giving orders--
-I do not give orders.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.160
You give me orders
and you expect me to listen. I do not--

47:10.244 --> 47:12.037
-Perhaps you should.
-I'll never listen to you!

47:12.120 --> 47:14.498
Or to anyone
I wholeheartedly disagree with!

47:14.581 --> 47:18.335
The fact it's taken you this long to come
to terms with that, to accept that fact--

47:18.418 --> 47:21.213
-You wish to know why?
-I am uncertain you even <i>know</i> why.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.757
-I know why.
-Enthrall me with your self-awareness.

47:23.841 --> 47:26.176
It is because I have never met
anyone like you.

47:28.887 --> 47:30.013
It is maddening,

47:31.390 --> 47:34.059
how much you consume my very being.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.651
My family is on the brink of ruin.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.946
I am nearly certain every last one
of my brothers and sisters

47:46.029 --> 47:47.990
secretly despise me.
My own mother, at that.

47:48.073 --> 47:50.826
Despite the fact I have lived
the better part of my life <i>for</i> them.

47:50.909 --> 47:51.952
And yet still,

47:52.953 --> 47:54.830
all I find myself thinking about,

47:54.913 --> 47:58.083
all I find myself
being able to breathe for…

48:00.711 --> 48:01.712
is you.

48:03.380 --> 48:05.382
Do you think that
I want to be in this position?

48:06.466 --> 48:09.928
Contending with these thoughts
of wanting to be nowhere except with you.

48:10.804 --> 48:12.973
Wanting to run away with you.

48:14.766 --> 48:16.351
Of acting on the most

48:17.311 --> 48:20.647
impure, forbidden desires,

48:21.356 --> 48:25.736
no matter… how much I must remind myself

48:25.819 --> 48:28.447
I am a gentleman, and you are a lady.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.657
Of that… …of that scent.

48:33.660 --> 48:36.747
It has remained imprinted on my mind

48:36.830 --> 48:40.292
ever since the night
of the conservatory ball on that terrace.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.089
Lilies.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.225
-You have to stop.
-I have to stop?

48:57.309 --> 48:59.853
There is no other course of action
to be concluded. You must stop!

48:59.937 --> 49:02.731
It has been you.
It has been you this entire time.

49:02.814 --> 49:04.441
Spinning my world off its axis,

49:04.524 --> 49:07.694
making me reconsider
everything I have ever told myself.

49:09.029 --> 49:12.282
I came here resolved… to save my family.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.242
Everything I have ever done--

49:14.326 --> 49:15.452
…has been for them.

49:19.706 --> 49:21.458
-Has been for them.
-Yeah.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.419
You are the one who must stop.

49:29.633 --> 49:31.301
You are the one who must stop.

49:31.802 --> 49:32.636
Before--

49:32.719 --> 49:35.597
Before what? Before we both
finally do something for ourselves?

49:48.193 --> 49:49.152
Please go inside.

49:53.156 --> 49:54.658
Go

49:54.741 --> 49:57.953
in… side

49:59.746 --> 50:02.374
What did I tell you
about you and your orders?

50:21.226 --> 50:22.811
-I will stop.

50:22.894 --> 50:24.730
-Do not stop.
-I will stop.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.565
Do not stop.

53:20.989 --> 53:22.490
I must speak with Miss Sharma.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.586
I know it is early,
but can you please tell her I'm here?

53:34.669 --> 53:36.796
I am afraid that is not possible, my lord.

53:37.422 --> 53:38.882
She does not seem to be here.

53:39.382 --> 53:41.259
One of the horses is gone too.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.890
Come on. Come on.

54:30.183 --> 54:31.184
Miss Sharma!

54:37.357 --> 54:38.191
Miss Sharma!

54:43.405 --> 54:44.906
No, no, no. Miss Sharma!

55:00.005 --> 55:00.964
Kate!

55:04.009 --> 55:05.468
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:12.017 --> 55:14.102
-Kate!
