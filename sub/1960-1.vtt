00:57.891 --> 01:00.059
Our story begins
high over New York City...

01:00.227 --> 01:01.811
in the luxurious
penthouse apartment...

01:01.979 --> 01:05.355
of perhaps
the most unlikely genius
the world has ever known.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.152
Oh. Sorry. You caught me
doing my yoga.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.319
You were expecting

01:10.404 --> 01:12.155
downward dog,
perhaps?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.825
My name is Mr. Peabody.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.994
And since we're going to be
spending some time together...

01:18.162 --> 01:20.204
I'd like to tell you
a little bit about myself.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.692
You see,
ever since I was a pup...

01:21.707 --> 01:23.541
it was clear that
I was different.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.044
I tried
to fit in...

01:27.129 --> 01:28.171
No, thank you.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.881
...but never could.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.675
As I grew,
I saw more and more
of my littermates...

01:33.051 --> 01:35.720
being chosen by
their new families.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.348
But for some reason,
I never was.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.352
Come on, boy!
Fetch the stick!

01:43.854 --> 01:45.897
But why? Won't you
just throw it again?

01:46.064 --> 01:48.357
It's an exercise in futility.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.027
I don't want this one,
Mommy. He's sarcastic.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.196
Wait, wait!
Come back!
Throw the stick.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.073
I'll stay, I'll heel,
I'll even shake hands.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.784
Bark, bark?

01:57.951 --> 02:01.120
So, without
a family of my own...

02:01.288 --> 02:03.748
I dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge...

02:04.041 --> 02:06.375
culture, and athletics.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.086
I received my degree at Harvard.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.089
Vale-dog-torian, of course.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.216
Yay!

02:13.300 --> 02:16.219
And then,
I devoted myself
to helping mankind.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.055
I pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.391
Yay!

02:22.601 --> 02:25.061
Resolved
geopolitical conflicts
around the globe.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.482
And in my spare time...

02:29.566 --> 02:32.151
I invented
the fist bump, planking,
tearaway pants...

02:32.236 --> 02:33.319
Auto-Tune...

02:33.403 --> 02:34.612
the backside ollie...

02:34.696 --> 02:35.780
and Zumba.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.406
Now go

02:37.825 --> 02:38.991
Stop

02:39.493 --> 02:40.535
Drop

02:41.411 --> 02:42.537
Pause

02:43.163 --> 02:46.833
But what I'm most proud of
is my son, Sherman.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.085
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.630
Oh!  Have you
told them about the WABAC?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.091
I was
just getting to that.

02:55.259 --> 02:58.594
When I adopted Sherman,
I vowed to be
the best father I could be.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.055
To prepare him for all
the wonders of the world,

03:01.139 --> 03:02.765
present and past.

03:02.933 --> 03:07.270
And so, Sherman
inspired the greatest
invention of my life...

03:07.855 --> 03:10.273
a time machine.

03:16.446 --> 03:20.199
Of course, time travel
can be a bit unpredictable.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.035
There are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.620
Let's just say,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

03:24.705 --> 03:26.539
wasn't always leaning.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.832
But there's
nothing like learning

03:27.958 --> 03:29.083
the lessons of
history firsthand.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.209
Right, Sherman?

03:30.294 --> 03:32.169
Where are we going
today, Mr. Peabody?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.796
Not "where," Sherman.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.798
"When."

03:48.729 --> 03:51.731
Whoa! This is
the biggest house
I've ever seen!

03:51.982 --> 03:54.859
It's the Palace
of Versailles, home
of Marie Antoinette.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.486
You know,
she was mostly
famous for one thing.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.863
Cake!

03:59.031 --> 04:02.325
I love cake so much.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.206
Marie Antoinette
sure likes cake,
Mr. Peabody.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.499
Oh!
Indeed she does.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.501
Marie was a woman
with a prodigious
appetite...

04:12.669 --> 04:14.670
for all things
covered with frosting.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.007
But her expensive tastes
made her the target
of much criticism.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.841
Why?
Because, Sherman...

04:20.010 --> 04:21.529
during Marie's reign,
the common people

04:21.678 --> 04:23.179
of France were exceedingly poor.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.181
You've got any bread?

04:25.349 --> 04:28.184
No! I'm exceedingly poor.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.186
Now, can we have some cake?

04:30.354 --> 04:31.354
Mais, oui.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.023
Oh, yeah, sorry.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.691
"May we" have some cake?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.026
Mais, oui!

04:37.527 --> 04:39.127
Maybe she can't hear me
through the hair.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.405
Sherman, what
the queen means is...

04:41.490 --> 04:44.492
Ah!
Let them eat cake!

04:47.537 --> 04:50.706
When the queen
heard the poor of Paris
could not even buy bread...

04:50.874 --> 04:53.209
she said,
"Let them eat cake."

04:53.293 --> 04:54.168
No!

04:54.252 --> 04:55.461
I heard it myself.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.837
It's a scandal!
It's an outrage!

04:56.922 --> 04:58.047
Down with the queen!

04:58.131 --> 04:59.131
Down with the monarchy!

04:59.549 --> 05:00.591
Wait!

05:00.759 --> 05:02.385
What kind of cake?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.103
Smashing party, Your Majesty.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.981
But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...

05:15.148 --> 05:17.400
Sherman? Sherman?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.276
Sherman!

05:21.238 --> 05:22.905
Sherman?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.743
Sherman! Here,
Sherman.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.578
Hey, Mr. Peabody.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.455
What are you doing in here?

05:31.623 --> 05:32.832
Trying these other cakes.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.336
There's one in here
with whipped cream and
strawberries that's...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.005
pretty fantastic!

05:39.131 --> 05:40.256
Sherman...

05:40.424 --> 05:42.258
don't you remember
why I told you to stay

05:42.426 --> 05:44.260
close to me during
the French Revolution?

05:44.428 --> 05:46.137
Because after
the French Revolution...

05:46.304 --> 05:47.930
it was gonna rain?
Close.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.433
I said, "After the
French Revolution comes...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.727
the Reign of Terror!"

05:58.275 --> 06:01.110
Round up the aristocrats.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.544
The queen and her
aristocratic cronies...

06:18.712 --> 06:21.464
must pay the price
for their gluttony.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.550
We will slaughter them
like the dogs they are.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.635
Starting with this one!

06:27.137 --> 06:28.137
Mr. Peabody!

06:28.972 --> 06:30.306
What should I do?

06:30.474 --> 06:33.309
Nothing, Sherman.
Just stay right there.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.643
But, Mr. Peabody!

06:34.811 --> 06:36.645
Everything is going
to be fine, Sherman.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.482
Just stay right there.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.698
Off with his head!

06:50.243 --> 06:52.787
Mr. Peabody!

06:58.335 --> 06:59.835
A cantaloupe?

07:00.003 --> 07:01.754
The lowest of the fruits.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.341
Who dares to insult me
with this melon?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.889
Get that dog!

07:12.516 --> 07:14.850
Mr. Peabody,
how did you escape?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.143
It's simple, Sherman.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.937
I noticed the distance
between the sewer lids...

07:18.105 --> 07:19.355
reasoned that there must be one

07:19.523 --> 07:20.731
directly under
the guillotine platform...

07:20.899 --> 07:22.499
noted the loose board
under the basket...

07:22.526 --> 07:23.567
computed the angle at
which the setting sun

07:23.693 --> 07:24.933
would bounce off your glasses...

07:24.945 --> 07:26.737
momentarily blinding
the executioner...

07:26.905 --> 07:28.739
and chose that moment
to swipe
the executioner's melon...

07:28.907 --> 07:31.909
giving me the added weight
to tip the boards,
facilitating my exit.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.244
That's amazing!

07:33.411 --> 07:34.411
It's not amazing.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.872
It was just a matter
of keeping my head.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.791
"Keeping your head."

07:39.376 --> 07:40.459
I don't get it.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.878
There he is!
After them!

07:43.046 --> 07:44.713
Come, Sherman, quick!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.427
Oh, this
water tastes terrible.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.388
Interestingly, that's not water.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.601
Ha-ha!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.145
I've got you now.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.816
Indeed you have,
Monsieur Robespierre.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.777
And what a master
of the chase you are.

08:06.862 --> 08:07.987
Oh, you noticed?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.113
Of course.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.656
Doubling back on me like that.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.824
That was genius.

08:11.992 --> 08:12.992
Thank you.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.077
I just hope you don't take
my little confederate, here.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.745
I depend on him so completely.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.997
Get over here, you.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.748
Drats!
You're devilishly clever.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.293
I know.
And much quicker
than you as well.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.044
But are you quick
enough for this?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.421
Ha-ha! See? Quick!

08:25.755 --> 08:27.756
Quick, yes, but not too smart.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.134
Oh! Another cantaloupe!

08:30.594 --> 08:31.594
Your sword!

08:32.095 --> 08:33.929
All right, Sherman,
looks like it's time

08:34.054 --> 08:35.806
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.099
Go!

08:37.267 --> 08:39.643
Attack! Parry!
Thrust! Repeat!

08:39.811 --> 08:41.437
No.
Remise!

08:41.520 --> 08:42.813
Good boy!

08:53.241 --> 08:54.783
Oh!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.204
Huh?

08:58.496 --> 08:59.788
Ha-ha! You missed!

08:59.956 --> 09:00.998
I never miss.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.213
Hop on!

09:07.631 --> 09:09.131
Whoa!

09:09.216 --> 09:11.383
Whoa! Whoa!

09:11.468 --> 09:14.345
Yeah! Whoa!

09:16.640 --> 09:17.890
Yeah!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.433
Do you smell that, Sherman?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.976
It wasn't me, Mr. Peabody.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.061
I know it wasn't you.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.812
It's the methane gas
in the sewer system.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.982
And given
the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

09:27.150 --> 09:28.150
we're about to use it...

09:28.318 --> 09:29.652
to blast out of here!

09:30.403 --> 09:31.987
Hang on!

09:37.661 --> 09:39.161
Whoo!

09:42.249 --> 09:44.667
Wow!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.509
Nice landing, eh, Sherman?
Oof!

09:56.179 --> 09:58.055
So, what did you
learn today, Sherman?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.474
That French Revolution
was crazy.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.642
How so?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.936
All those guys
getting their
heads chopped off...

10:04.104 --> 10:06.689
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn't right.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.358
And think, Marie Antoinette
could have avoided
the whole revolution...

10:09.526 --> 10:11.026
if she'd simply issued an edict

10:11.152 --> 10:12.695
to distribute
bread amongst the poor.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.542
But then,
she couldn't have
had her dessert.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.031
Why not, Mr. Peabody?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.117
Because, Sherman, you can't have

10:18.201 --> 10:20.577
your cake and edict, too.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.372
I don't get it.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.926
Where are we
gonna go tomorrow,
Mr. Peabody?

10:36.094 --> 10:39.096
Ancient Rome?
The Wild West? 1492?

10:39.264 --> 10:42.808
No, Sherman,
tomorrow we won't be going
to any of those places.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.018
Oh. Why not?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.342
Because tomorrow's adventure...

10:45.395 --> 10:48.230
is one that you're
going to be taking
all on your own.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.773
What do you mean,
Mr. Peabody?

10:49.941 --> 10:50.941
Don't you remember?

10:51.109 --> 10:52.359
It's your first day of school.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.611
Oh. Can I drive?
Of course not.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.917
Remember, Sherman,
"i" before "e,"
except after "c."

11:09.085 --> 11:10.753
I know, Mr. Peabody!

11:10.920 --> 11:12.840
And don't forget about
the commutative principle.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.506
Two plus three
equals three plus two.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.342
I know, Mr. Peabody!

11:16.509 --> 11:17.509
And if you have to
go to the bathroom...

11:17.677 --> 11:19.970
just raise your hand proudly
and say, "I have to go."

11:20.138 --> 11:21.805
I will, Mr. Peabody.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.683
And remember,
the No. 2 pencil is
standard for most uses...

11:24.851 --> 11:27.102
but there are times
when a No. 1 comes in handy.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.687
I left a little pencil chart
in your backpack...

11:28.855 --> 11:31.440
which you can consult
if it ever
becomes a judgment call.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.651
I think
I'll be okay!

11:37.447 --> 11:38.447
Okay, bye, Mr. Peabody.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.573
Wait.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.824
See you after school.
Sherman!

11:40.992 --> 11:43.952
I gotta go. I gotta
sign up for the clubs.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.871
No one is more in
favor of participation

11:45.997 --> 11:47.790
in fraternal
organizations than I.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.168
But before you go,
I want you to have this.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.170
Thanks. What is it?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.005
A dog whistle.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.304
It doesn't work,
Mr. Peabody.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.682
It works fine, Sherman.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.352
It's just a frequency
only dogs can hear.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.062
Oh, cool.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.689
Let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you...

12:12.857 --> 12:14.983
that no matter what
challenges you face,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.236
no matter how far
away I might seem...

12:17.404 --> 12:19.655
Bye, Mr. Peabody!

12:22.700 --> 12:25.077
...I'm with you.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.253
George Washington.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.506
Who can tell me who he is?

12:37.674 --> 12:39.550
Oh, me! I can! I can!

12:39.634 --> 12:41.718
Uh... Sherman.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.680
The first president
of the United
States of America.

12:44.848 --> 12:46.014
Good job.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.059
And when President Washington
was a little boy...

12:49.227 --> 12:52.062
what kind of tree
did he cut down?

12:52.230 --> 12:53.355
Ooh! Ooh, me! Me! Me!

12:53.523 --> 12:55.399
Penny?
A cherry tree.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.650
Apocryphal.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.860
What kind of tree is that?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.279
It's not a tree.
It's a word.
"Apocryphal."

13:00.447 --> 13:02.114
It means that story is not true.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.866
Really?
Yeah.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.951
George Washington
never cut down
a cherry tree...

13:06.119 --> 13:07.703
and he never said
he couldn't lie.

13:07.871 --> 13:10.706
People made those
stories up to teach kids
a lesson about lying...

13:10.874 --> 13:11.874
but they're not true.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.196
He did cross the Delaware River,

13:13.251 --> 13:15.878
Christmas night, 1776, though.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.464
My dad took me
there this summer.
We crossed it, too.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.632
I fell in.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.929
Looks like someone
really knows their
history, huh, Penny?

13:32.395 --> 13:33.770
It's really great
meeting you guys.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.814
Maybe you can come over
to my house sometime.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.775
I could bring my new model.
It's a hydrogen atom.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.569
You've only got one, huh?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.529
Guess we'll have to split it.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.781
Good one!

13:46.826 --> 13:48.243
Check it, guys.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.498
What do you got there,
Sherman?

13:52.665 --> 13:53.957
Kibbles or bits?

13:54.125 --> 13:56.293
Actually, I've got baby carrots,

13:56.419 --> 13:58.587
organic apple juice,
and a tuna sandwich.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.174
It's super-high
in omega-3s.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.927
So, you eat human food, huh?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.595
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

14:06.763 --> 14:07.846
Because you're a dog.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.097
No, I'm not.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.434
Sure you are.
Your dad is a dog,
so you're a dog, too.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.937
I think you're confused.
It's an adoptive
relationship.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.605
Zip it, Carl.
Okay.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.941
Here, I'll show you.
Fetch!

14:21.444 --> 14:23.529
Go on, doggy.
Go get your lunch.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.613
Go on.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.697
Go get it.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.451
Ugh. The humiliation.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.287
Sherman,
go get your food.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.331
Make like a good little doggy.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.874
Ruff-ruff!

14:41.965 --> 14:43.674
What's this?
It's mine!

14:43.841 --> 14:45.300
Give it back!

14:45.426 --> 14:47.469
What is it? A whistle?

14:48.638 --> 14:50.764
Ugh! Stupid thing
doesn't even work.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.391
It's a dog whistle, Penny.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.977
It operates at a frequency
that only dogs can hear.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.728
Back up, Carl.
Okay.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.189
Penny, that whistle
is my private property.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.316
Give it back!
Jump, doggy,
jump.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.651
I am not a dog.

15:02.819 --> 15:03.819
Come on, Sherman!

15:03.987 --> 15:06.655
Just admit it.
You're a dog. Say it.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.864
Let me go!

15:08.032 --> 15:10.492
Not until you beg like a dog.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.411
Come on, Sherman. Beg!

15:12.579 --> 15:15.163
Fight, fight, fight!

15:16.833 --> 15:20.669
Mr. Peabody,
thank you for coming in
on such short notice...

15:20.837 --> 15:23.005
to discuss
the problem with Sherman.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.012
Oh, it's not a problem
at all, Principal Purdy.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.341
I fully expected this.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.509
You did?
Yes.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.970
And, as with all
things Sherman-related,
I prepared for it.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.471
Here's a curriculum
that takes Sherman's

15:31.598 --> 15:32.998
advanced preparation
into account...

15:33.141 --> 15:34.808
but won't require you
to have him skip
one or more grades.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.892
Mr. Peabody...

15:35.977 --> 15:38.497
Here are some
pre-algebra worksheets,
an advanced reading list...

15:38.521 --> 15:40.272
and a link to
a website I created

15:40.398 --> 15:42.149
so he can start
studying Mandarin Chinese.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.859
It is, after all,
the language of the future.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.027
Mr. Peabody!

15:45.111 --> 15:47.112
I'm not saying he
shouldn't study French,
too, Principal Purdy.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.400
I'm saying have him do both.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.531
Mr. Peabody!

15:49.699 --> 15:51.366
What? Not enough? Swahili?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.120
Sherman got into a fight today.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.039
Oh, dear.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.207
Pictures were taken...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.543
for insurance purposes.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.636
He bit her.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.891
I must say,
it doesn't look good
for you, Mr. Peabody.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.144
After all, you are a dog.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.146
Who, may I ask, are you?

16:21.314 --> 16:24.816
I am Ms. Grunion from
the Bureau of Child
Safety and Protection.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.737
We're required by
law to contact them
whenever there's an...

16:29.739 --> 16:30.739
incident.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.909
Sherman has never done
anything like this before.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.577
I'm sure he must
have had a reason.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.537
Well, the girl was being
a bit of a bully...

16:37.705 --> 16:38.914
Quiet, Purdy!

16:39.082 --> 16:41.333
It's normal for
children to tease.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.002
It's not normal
for them to bite.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.838
Clearly, it's because of
how he's being raised.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.675
In my opinion,
a dog can never be

16:49.801 --> 16:52.511
a suitable parent
to a little boy.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.929
I must point out,
Ms. Grunion...

16:54.097 --> 16:55.847
that I won
the right to adopt Sherman

16:55.932 --> 16:57.099
in a court of law.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.018
And the court can
take it away from you.

17:00.770 --> 17:04.606
I'll be coming to your
home tomorrow evening
to conduct an investigation.

17:04.773 --> 17:08.402
If I discover that
you are, in any way,
an unfit parent...

17:08.569 --> 17:12.280
I will see to it
Sherman is removed
from your custody.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.079
Permanently.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.915
I hope I've made myself clear.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.713
Crystal.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.426
I'm sorry
I bit her, Mr. Peabody.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.969
I won't do it again.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.595
You're darn tooting
you won't do it again.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.640
This kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.060
And rather uncharacteristic,
given how you feel
about Mr. Gandhi.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.604
What on earth provoked it?

17:48.276 --> 17:50.944
She called me a dog.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.454
Well, all right then.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.249
Thank you for telling me.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.169
Try and get some sleep.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.800
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.138
I have a deep regard
for you as well, Sherman.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.582
Close your eyes

18:48.628 --> 18:50.504
Have no fear

18:52.423 --> 18:56.218
The master's gone
He's on the run

18:56.302 --> 18:58.637
And your daddy's here

19:01.349 --> 19:05.143
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

19:22.370 --> 19:24.246
Say a little prayer

19:27.250 --> 19:30.752
Every day, in every way

19:30.878 --> 19:33.672
It's getting better and better

19:35.842 --> 19:41.054
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

19:44.976 --> 19:49.771
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

19:53.526 --> 19:55.861
A hard road to hoe

19:56.487 --> 19:59.906
Yes, it's a long way to go

20:00.366 --> 20:03.076
But in the meantime

20:10.167 --> 20:12.294
Take my hand

20:16.215 --> 20:20.302
Life is what happens
to you while you're busy
making other plans

20:23.014 --> 20:28.476
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

20:32.899 --> 20:36.985
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

20:39.447 --> 20:40.572
Mr. Peabody...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.782
you are
a Nobel Prize-winning
scientist.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.492
An advisor to heads of state.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.411
A captain of industry.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.080
Why would you
want to adopt a boy?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.749
Because, Your Honor...

20:50.917 --> 20:56.504
when I found Sherman,
it reminded me of how
I started out in life.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.508
And now, I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.927
A home.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.679
And you're sure you're
capable of meeting
all the challenges...

21:04.847 --> 21:06.640
of raising a human boy?

21:06.849 --> 21:10.018
With all due respect,
how hard could it be?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.188
Very well, then.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.357
If a boy can adopt a dog...

21:15.524 --> 21:19.194
I see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.866
Da-da!

21:25.034 --> 21:26.493
No, Sherman, not "Da-da."

21:26.661 --> 21:28.870
You shall call me
"Mr. Peabody."

21:29.038 --> 21:31.706
Or, in less formal moments,
simply "Peabody."

21:33.209 --> 21:34.376
That's right.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.211
"Mr. Pea-baba."

21:36.963 --> 21:41.591
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

22:18.754 --> 22:19.874
What's cooking, Mr. Peabody?

22:19.964 --> 22:21.089
Oh, nothing much.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.426
Just a little Dungeness
crab with a passion-fruit
basil concassé.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.553
Some truffled quails
in a juniper-berry reduction.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.555
And Baked Alaska.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.349
Wow! Is today some
kind of special occasion?

22:31.434 --> 22:32.434
You could say.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.810
It's not my birthday.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.228
No, it isn't.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.479
It's not your birthday.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.772
Right again.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.941
It's not Father's Day.
Is it?

22:40.109 --> 22:42.444
Nope. It's not Father's Day.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.904
Is the president
coming to dinner again?

22:45.072 --> 22:46.865
No.
Oh.

22:47.241 --> 22:48.575
So, who's coming to dinner?

22:48.743 --> 22:51.119
Let's just say,
if the evening
is a success...

22:51.287 --> 22:53.955
we can put this whole
"biting" business behind us.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.715
The Petersons! Welcome.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.966
So, he's literally a dog.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.217
Paul!

23:06.385 --> 23:07.385
No, that's all right.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.263
Although,
I prefer "literate dog."

23:10.347 --> 23:11.556
That's funny.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.974
Isn't that funny, Paul?

23:14.268 --> 23:16.186
He's not
a big laugher.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.969
We're so delighted
you could make it
on such short notice.

23:19.106 --> 23:23.151
Aren't we, Sherman?

23:23.319 --> 23:26.654
Yeah, we're interested
in what's going on,
that's for sure.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.656
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.283
Hi, Penny.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.951
Hello, Sherman.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.661
Now, why don't you go show Penny

23:33.829 --> 23:35.413
your mineral collection,
Sherman?

23:35.581 --> 23:37.123
I'm sure she'll find
those new geodes

23:37.208 --> 23:38.833
of yours fascinating.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.919
Come on.

23:43.339 --> 23:46.007
I am so glad you
accepted my invitation.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.511
Now, the kids can
resolve their differences
before Ms. Grunion arrives.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.930
You're barking up
the wrong tree, mister.
In fact...

23:52.098 --> 23:54.498
if it weren't for Patty,
I would have pressed
charges already.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.837
And I have to
tell you, Peabody...

23:55.976 --> 23:57.435
where my daughter is concerned,

23:57.561 --> 23:59.020
nothing is more
important than...

23:59.188 --> 24:01.648
Hello. Sure,
I'll take a survey.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.283
Everything going swimmingly?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.535
Ugh.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.287
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming over here?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.540
Because I didn't
want you to worry.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.947
Okay, because I
didn't want to listen
to your bellyaching.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.503
Thank you for your honesty.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.671
You're welcome.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.382
I don't know what you
think we're supposed to
do in here anyway.

24:27.550 --> 24:28.967
She hates me.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.177
Share your interests.
Tell a witty anecdote.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.387
Mr. Peabody...

24:32.555 --> 24:33.972
I hate her.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.015
Sherman,
every great relationship...

24:36.183 --> 24:37.559
starts from a place of conflict,

24:37.685 --> 24:39.060
and evolves into
something richer.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.147
Bonne chance.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.649
Make it work.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.901
But don't tell her
about the WABAC.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.741
Don't even
think about it.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.743
Ah.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.841
Peabody,
that was amazing!

25:10.092 --> 25:11.926
Paul, wasn't that amazing?

25:12.094 --> 25:13.386
I'm more into
rock-'n'-roll.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.768
I meant flamenco.

25:27.735 --> 25:28.735
Bagpipes?

25:29.737 --> 25:31.029
Uh, didgeridoo.

25:34.617 --> 25:35.617
Sitar.

25:35.910 --> 25:37.076
Steel drums.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.286
Trombone.

25:38.454 --> 25:39.746
Xylophone.

25:39.914 --> 25:40.914
Djembe?

25:41.081 --> 25:42.123
Calliope.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.750
Oboe. Piccolo.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.376
Tuba. Dobro.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.711
Slide whistle. Yodeling.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.921
Hurdy-gurdy. Ocarina.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.297
Harmonium. Musical saw.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.299
You know what?
This has been great...

25:51.467 --> 25:53.551
but a complete waste of time.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.304
Now, let's get Penny
and go home!

25:56.472 --> 25:57.555
Are you all right, Paul?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.266
I'm... fine.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.893
This happens
whenever he's tense.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.061
Paul, if I might...

26:03.145 --> 26:04.270
Stay away from me, Peabody!

26:04.438 --> 26:06.814
Just get back!
I need traction.

26:06.982 --> 26:10.068
You can trust me, Paul.
I'm a licensed chiropractor.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.569
Ow! Huh.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.746
Ooh...

26:22.748 --> 26:24.249
Ah...

26:24.667 --> 26:26.000
Peabody...

26:26.168 --> 26:27.460
I feel great.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.255
I...
I really feel great!

26:30.506 --> 26:32.757
Peabody,
you're a miracle worker.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.010
Ha-ha! Look at me!

26:36.136 --> 26:37.679
I'm dancing!

26:39.848 --> 26:40.932
You know, Penny...

26:41.016 --> 26:43.476
Sigmund Freud says
if you don't like a person...

26:43.644 --> 26:47.313
it's because they remind
you of something you
don't like about yourself.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.274
What do you know
about Sigmund Freud?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.525
More than you think.

26:50.693 --> 26:53.152
Sure.
Just like you know
all that stuff...

26:53.320 --> 26:56.864
about George Washington
not really cutting
down the cherry tree.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.199
Ugh. What a crock.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.367
But it's true!

26:59.535 --> 27:01.160
How do you know?
I just know!

27:01.328 --> 27:02.704
Did you read it in a book?
No!

27:02.871 --> 27:03.997
See it in a movie?
No!

27:04.164 --> 27:05.164
Did your brainiac dad tell you?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.291
No!

27:06.458 --> 27:07.618
So, how do you know, Sherman?

27:07.668 --> 27:08.960
How do you know?

27:09.044 --> 27:10.211
He told me.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.337
Who told you?

27:11.422 --> 27:12.964
George Washington.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.134
George Washington?

27:17.553 --> 27:18.803
Yeah.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.388
Ugh! Liar.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.727
But don't tell
her about the WABAC.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.479
He calls it the "WABAC."

27:28.647 --> 27:30.398
So, where have you gone in it?

27:30.566 --> 27:33.026
Not "where," Penny, "when."

27:33.193 --> 27:35.695
Okay, smart guy, when?

27:35.863 --> 27:40.533
Oh, 1965, 1776, 1620...

27:40.701 --> 27:44.412
1492, 1215, 4.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.539
Can it go back to an hour ago?
Why?

27:46.707 --> 27:49.042
Because I could take it home,
pretend to be sick...

27:49.209 --> 27:51.085
and not come to
this lame dinner party.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.130
Ha-ha. Mr. Peabody says
you should never
use the WABAC...

27:54.381 --> 27:56.424
to travel to
a time when you existed.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.633
How come?

27:57.718 --> 27:58.758
There would be two of you.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.595
Oh, yeah.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.513
I guess the world's
not ready for that.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.685
Wow.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.647
Um, well, now that
we've seen it, maybe
we should go back.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.942
Are you kidding?
Where should we go first?

28:15.110 --> 28:18.780
Mr. Peabody says
I'm not allowed to
drive it till I'm older.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.199
Do you do everything
Mr. Peabody says?

28:21.367 --> 28:22.450
Yeah.

28:22.618 --> 28:24.410
You know what that
makes you, Sherman.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.412
An obedient son?

28:26.580 --> 28:27.705
Nope.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.082
A dog.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.138
Ooh!
Nice control.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.599
Look at him go!
Take it, Patty!

28:47.768 --> 28:48.976
Heads up, Paul!
Whoa!

28:49.269 --> 28:51.562
Here you go. Zing!

28:55.818 --> 28:57.568
Oh, yeah.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.987
Oh!
Hey, look at that.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.739
This is fun!

29:04.660 --> 29:07.620
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

29:08.997 --> 29:10.498
"Einstein on the Beach."

29:10.666 --> 29:11.916
Yummy.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.503
To the kids.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.463
To the kids!

29:18.340 --> 29:19.841
Mr. Peabody.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.300
Sherman?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.593
Can I talk to you a second?

29:22.678 --> 29:23.845
Of course.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.304
Excuse me.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.488
I've really hit it off
with Penny's parents.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.647
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

29:34.815 --> 29:37.525
Uh, I would hold off
filing it just yet.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.027
What do you mean?
Where's Penny?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.155
Uh... Ancient Egypt.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.532
You used the WABAC?

29:45.868 --> 29:48.161
What's happening,
big guy? We're running low.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.999
I'll be right there, Paul.

29:53.167 --> 29:54.367
How could you do such a thing?

29:54.418 --> 29:55.543
She called me a liar...

29:55.627 --> 29:56.752
for saying George Washington

29:56.837 --> 29:58.629
never cut down a cherry tree.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.048
So, you took her
to see George Washington?

30:01.216 --> 30:03.217
Yeah. She was into it.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.886
Hey, Pea-buddy.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.053
Hey.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.180
Where's Penny?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.681
Playing hide-and-seek.
Pooping.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.683
Pooping.
Playing hide and seek.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.145
Well, which is it?
Uh...

30:14.897 --> 30:16.189
Hey, what's going on here?

30:16.356 --> 30:18.024
Yeah. What's going on here?

30:18.192 --> 30:19.632
What have you done with Penny?
Penny?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.152
Penny? Penny!

30:21.320 --> 30:23.237
Oh, my gosh!
Where's our daughter?

30:23.489 --> 30:25.948
It's hard to say, Paul.

30:26.158 --> 30:31.078
She could be here, or here,
or here, or here...

30:31.246 --> 30:32.455
or here.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.666
That will hold them.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.114
I learned that
trick from a swami

30:37.252 --> 30:38.572
at the Begawan Giri
in Ubud, Bali.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.004
Let's go!

30:54.061 --> 30:57.021
Ancient Egypt.
Land of the Pharaohs.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.941
A beacon of progress
on the horizon of humanity...

31:00.108 --> 31:03.778
but a cruel and
barbarous civilization
just the same.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.948
I just hope
Penny isn't suffering
too badly.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.127
I got it.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.587
What are you doing here?

31:21.755 --> 31:23.631
We have come to take you home.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.467
Ugh! What's the Egyptian word
for "tattletale"?

31:27.886 --> 31:30.596
But that's beside the point.
Get your clothes on,
we're going home.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.807
Who died and made you Pharaoh?

31:32.975 --> 31:34.892
Now, bring on
the mani-pedi.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.104
See, Mr. Peabody?
Lmpossible!

31:38.272 --> 31:39.981
Indeed,
but watch what happens...

31:40.148 --> 31:43.401
when an immovable object
meets an irresistible force.

31:43.860 --> 31:44.980
Penny...

31:44.987 --> 31:47.113
come here, right now.
Penny, come!

31:47.281 --> 31:48.990
I'm not Penny anymore.

31:49.157 --> 31:53.661
Now, I'm Princess Hatsheput,
precious flower of the Nile.

31:53.829 --> 31:54.912
"Precious," perhaps,
but if you think

31:55.038 --> 31:56.318
"we're going to
leave you here...

31:56.331 --> 31:58.583
you are most
definitely in "de-Nile."

32:00.252 --> 32:01.419
I don't get it.

32:01.503 --> 32:02.503
Now, come along.

32:02.671 --> 32:03.963
Unhand her!

32:05.132 --> 32:07.633
What's the matter,
my sweet little
desert blossom?

32:07.801 --> 32:10.011
Are these barbarians
bothering you?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.763
As a matter of fact, they are.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.348
Bow, barbarians.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.517
As you wish, Your Highness.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.519
Who's that, Mr. Peabody?

32:18.687 --> 32:21.105
That, Sherman, is
the living image of Amun...

32:21.273 --> 32:24.358
son of Akhenaten,
lord of the 18th Dynasty
of the New Kingdom...

32:24.526 --> 32:25.651
King Tutankhamun.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.612
Otherwise known
as "King Tut."

32:27.696 --> 32:28.821
My boyfriend.

32:28.864 --> 32:31.616
King Tut is
your boyfriend?
Mmm-hmm.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.060
Would you like me
to have them skinned,
covered with honey...

32:34.202 --> 32:36.495
and laid in
a pit of fire ants?

32:37.205 --> 32:38.623
You would do that for me?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.876
Anything, my desert flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.503
What? You can't
marry this guy!

32:44.588 --> 32:45.630
Why not?

32:45.714 --> 32:48.507
Well, for one,
his name rhymes
with "butt."

32:48.675 --> 32:51.636
I don't care.
I'm gonna have a big,
fat, Egyptian wedding.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.055
Spoiler alert,
King Tut dies young.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.057
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

32:56.224 --> 32:58.624
Oh, trust me,
I've thought it through.
I'm getting everything.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.478
The royal astronomers
have decreed...

33:00.854 --> 33:03.773
the wedding must take
place tomorrow at dawn.

33:03.857 --> 33:04.899
Who is he?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.192
He is Ay.
He is you?

33:06.360 --> 33:09.195
I am Ay. The Grand Vizier.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.405
Yeah, that's his name.
Oh.

33:11.657 --> 33:14.700
Oh, Grand Vizier,
would you mind telling
the precious princess, here...

33:14.868 --> 33:17.411
precisely what it means
to marry the young Pharaoh.

33:17.579 --> 33:18.579
Gladly.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.916
It means she
will be bound to him
in eternity...

33:22.084 --> 33:23.751
through the sacred ceremonies

33:23.835 --> 33:26.754
of disembowelment
and mummification...

33:27.089 --> 33:29.048
as described in the holy texts.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.758
Um, hold up a second.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.593
Can you walk me
through that, somebody?

33:32.761 --> 33:35.846
What he means, Penny,
is that when I die
they'll kill you, too.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.683
And then they'll rip out
your organs, stuff them
in canopic jars...

33:38.850 --> 33:40.393
and then mummify
whatever is left.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.602
Okay, I'm seeing this now.

33:41.770 --> 33:44.563
Thank you.
I'm going to go with them.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.608
There's no turning back now.

33:47.901 --> 33:48.901
To the palace!

33:49.069 --> 33:50.903
Let the wedding
preparations begin!

33:51.405 --> 33:53.531
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!

33:53.699 --> 33:54.699
Do something!

33:54.866 --> 33:55.866
Don't worry, Penny!

33:56.034 --> 33:57.201
We'll save you!

34:01.707 --> 34:03.347
Hey, wait! You can't just...

34:04.501 --> 34:06.168
Leave us here.

34:06.628 --> 34:07.795
Mr. Peabody?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.004
Yes, Sherman?

34:09.172 --> 34:10.331
Can
I hold your hand?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.174
Of course you can.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.802
Boy, your hand
is cold, Mr. Peabody.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.469
Sherman?
Yeah?

34:17.973 --> 34:18.973
That's not my hand.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.981
That's disarming.

34:27.149 --> 34:30.067
Now, to find a way out of here.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.235
Yuck!

34:31.319 --> 34:32.652
Look around, Sherman.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.989
These tombs
are lined with
hieroglyphics...

34:35.157 --> 34:37.283
designed to assist
the pharaohs' souls

34:37.409 --> 34:39.534
in their journey
to the afterlife.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.830
And they may assist us as well.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.417
Oh, this depicts the god Anubis

34:46.501 --> 34:48.585
sailing the boat of Ra
to the underworld.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.214
It appears the boats of Ra
are the key to our escape.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.507
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

34:54.676 --> 34:57.219
Well, if you ask me,
we should let her
marry that guy.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.554
They deserve each other.

34:58.722 --> 34:59.889
What's that, Sherman?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.515
Tut? Give me a break.

35:01.683 --> 35:04.894
Bald, wears a skirt, and makeup.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.661
If I didn't know
any better, Sherman,
I would say you were jealous.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.565
Jealous? Of what?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.525
Tut's affection
for Penny, of course.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.110
You think I like Penny?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.528
Mmm-hmm.

35:14.738 --> 35:15.863
Give me a break!

35:16.031 --> 35:20.701
It's not like I
want to hold her hand,
or go to the park...

35:20.869 --> 35:23.704
or watch her while
she's brushing her hair.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.042
Or anything.

35:28.418 --> 35:29.543
Hmm.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.296
A-ha!

35:34.925 --> 35:36.467
Quickly, Sherman.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.056
Ah, ah, ah!
Careful, Sherman.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.891
It's a booby trap.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.268
What's so funny?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.728
You said "booby."

35:49.815 --> 35:52.316
One wrong step
and we're done for.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.152
"The boat...

35:55.320 --> 35:57.822
"of Ra sails straight...

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
"to day.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.952
"Take the wrong boat...

36:03.119 --> 36:04.411
man will pay."

36:04.579 --> 36:06.099
All right, Sherman,
now it's your turn.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.666
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.792
Huh?

36:09.876 --> 36:11.502
Think it through,
one step at a time.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.800
The boat of Ra sails straight...

36:17.968 --> 36:18.968
play.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.011
Uh, I mean, "pay."

36:21.179 --> 36:22.263
Oh, my.

36:25.767 --> 36:26.976
Uh-oh.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.806
Run!

36:36.152 --> 36:37.695
The boats of Ra!

36:37.863 --> 36:39.823
One boat is the way out,
the other will send us...

36:39.948 --> 36:41.548
plunging into darkness
and certain death.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.033
What?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.201
Sherman, get in the boat.

36:44.369 --> 36:47.288
As soon as I move
these blocks together,
it's going to move very fast.

36:47.455 --> 36:48.539
Which boat, Mr. Peabody?

36:48.665 --> 36:49.707
What?

36:49.875 --> 36:52.459
Which boat
is the "not-certain-
death-plunge" boat?

36:52.627 --> 36:53.794
That one!

37:07.475 --> 37:08.642
We did it, Sherman!

37:08.727 --> 37:09.810
Sherman?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.562
Mr. Peabody!

37:11.730 --> 37:13.022
What are you doing over there?

37:13.189 --> 37:15.399
I thought you
pointed to this one!

37:25.160 --> 37:26.660
Ahhh!

37:40.842 --> 37:42.885
Sherman? Sherman?

37:43.053 --> 37:44.511
Are you all right?

37:45.221 --> 37:46.847
I'm good.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.528
The sun god, Ra...

38:01.696 --> 38:06.283
commands us to begin
the sacred ceremony!

38:16.419 --> 38:20.047
Bring forth the blade
for the blood oath.

38:24.219 --> 38:28.973
Where blade meets flesh
in this sacred rite...

38:31.601 --> 38:32.893
We pay tribute...

38:33.061 --> 38:35.229
to the sun god, Ra!

38:35.981 --> 38:37.231
Wait!

38:38.942 --> 38:39.984
Anubis!

38:40.068 --> 38:41.235
The god of death!

38:41.403 --> 38:43.570
The wedding
must not continue.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.614
Why, Anubis, why?

38:45.782 --> 38:48.283
Plagues. Plagues!

38:48.618 --> 38:50.786
If this marriage
pact is sealed...

38:50.954 --> 38:54.790
I will shower
down upon the land
uncountable plagues.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.458
Oy, again with the plagues!

38:56.626 --> 38:58.627
Why did I ever move to Egypt?

38:58.795 --> 39:01.922
But, Anubis,
the sun god, Ra,
has decreed...

39:02.090 --> 39:04.758
that this girl
is to be
the boy-king's wife.

39:05.135 --> 39:06.593
That's so funny.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.972
I was talking to
the sun god, Ra,
just the other day...

39:10.140 --> 39:12.766
and he told me
he changed his mind.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.851
Really?

39:13.935 --> 39:17.855
Old "Flip-Flop Ra,"
we call him here
in the underworld.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.191
But it's too late.
We've already paid
for the catering.

39:22.819 --> 39:26.155
Too bad!
You're going to
lose your deposit.

39:28.658 --> 39:32.119
More smoke, Sherman.
This canine
subterfuge is working.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.454
Deliver the girl...

39:33.621 --> 39:36.498
to the gates of the city,
and leave her there...

39:36.666 --> 39:39.793
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith.

39:39.961 --> 39:43.964
Only in this
manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.133
The girl must go!

39:47.594 --> 39:48.635
Ow!

39:48.720 --> 39:50.471
Anubis has spoken!

39:50.638 --> 39:52.848
Take this girl to the gates!

39:52.974 --> 39:54.141
Ow.

39:59.481 --> 40:02.024
Anubis, you sound unwell.

40:02.192 --> 40:04.693
Well, I have been feeling
a little under the weather...

40:04.861 --> 40:07.488
but I'm feeling much better now.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.406
Thank you.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.077
Phew! Huh?

40:20.668 --> 40:22.461
Penny, Sherman, quickly.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.629
Come on, Penny.

40:23.713 --> 40:24.880
Sherman!

40:26.674 --> 40:28.133
Ah!

40:30.678 --> 40:32.054
Runaway bride!

40:32.222 --> 40:33.764
Stop them, you fools!

40:36.810 --> 40:37.810
Ah!

40:53.743 --> 40:55.869
Penny, Sherman, climb aboard.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.497
Whoo-hoo!

41:06.214 --> 41:08.215
They're getting away!

41:08.883 --> 41:09.883
Ah!

41:19.018 --> 41:20.686
Whoa!

41:23.898 --> 41:25.607
I got it.

41:27.861 --> 41:29.486
Whoo-hoo! We made it.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.452
Where do we
go next, Mr. Peabody?
Home.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.334
We've got to get back
to the dinner party...

41:33.408 --> 41:35.284
before Penny's parents
realize she's missing.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.786
We don't have to
mention the whole...

41:37.954 --> 41:39.830
uh, King Tut
wedding thing, right?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.165
Certainly not.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.958
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,

41:43.084 --> 41:44.804
they get married too
young in Ancient Egypt.

41:44.961 --> 41:47.838
Or, perhaps,
I'm just some old "Giza."

41:49.716 --> 41:50.924
Huh?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.135
Warning.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.762
WABAC power supply insufficient.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.348
Charge now. Warning.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.100
Uh, what's the matter,
Mr. Peabody?

42:00.268 --> 42:02.978
All this zipping about
the cosmos has drained
our power supply.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.272
We're going to have to
make an unscheduled stop.

42:05.565 --> 42:06.690
As luck would have it...

42:06.774 --> 42:08.934
we have just enough
power to make it
to the Renaissance.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.459
I can't even
tell my left brain
from my right anymore!

42:25.627 --> 42:27.628
How many times
I got to tell you,
Mona Lisa?

42:27.795 --> 42:28.795
Mona Lisa?

42:28.838 --> 42:30.964
I can't
paint the picture...

42:31.132 --> 42:33.050
until you smile!

42:33.218 --> 42:36.803
Leonardo, tell me one thing
I have to smile about.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.722
The sunshine, the pasta.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.726
All the things that make
Italy such a popular
tourist destination!

42:42.894 --> 42:45.687
But I have not
seen any of them,
Leonardo!

42:45.855 --> 42:49.149
Because I'm
sitting here all day
on my abbondanza!

42:49.984 --> 42:52.736
I don't think
that means
"chair" in Italian.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.989
Ah, Peabody, my old friend.

42:56.157 --> 42:58.575
What a welcome interruption!

42:58.743 --> 43:02.329
Believe you me,
this woman is
making me nuts.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.081
So, how you been?

43:04.249 --> 43:06.041
Good to see you.
What do you want?

43:06.209 --> 43:08.001
We're in a desperate
hurry to get home,

43:08.127 --> 43:09.878
but the WABAC
needs a jump start...

43:10.046 --> 43:12.339
and we thought, who better than

43:12.465 --> 43:14.675
Leonardo da Vinci to
help us on our way?

43:14.842 --> 43:17.261
Peabody,
I would love to help you,

43:17.387 --> 43:19.763
but you come at a very bad time.

43:19.931 --> 43:23.016
I don't know
what I'm going to do
with this crazy woman.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.602
You see what I mean?

43:25.728 --> 43:26.888
What seems to be the problem?

43:26.938 --> 43:28.272
"What is the problem?"

43:28.439 --> 43:31.024
I am halfway done
with the painting,
she won't even smile.

43:31.192 --> 43:34.069
Fine. I smile.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.865
No! That's a fake smile!

43:39.033 --> 43:40.367
Everybody knows that!

43:40.535 --> 43:42.786
Why don't you
make it a real smile?

43:42.954 --> 43:44.413
Why don't you say
something funny?

43:44.580 --> 43:46.039
I paint the paintings.

43:46.207 --> 43:48.041
I make the machines.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.961
I don't tell the jokes!

43:51.129 --> 43:53.714
Perhaps, I can be
of assistance. You see...

43:53.881 --> 43:55.924
humor is not immune
to the laws of science.

43:56.092 --> 43:57.884
Using algorithms,
we can extrapolate

43:58.011 --> 43:59.761
what is universally
considered "funny"...

43:59.929 --> 44:02.055
thus producing a formula that is

44:02.181 --> 44:04.224
scientifically
certain to cause laughter.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.227
Case in point, the pratfall.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.277
Is everyone amused?

44:17.238 --> 44:18.488
Hmm.

44:18.573 --> 44:20.157
The data
was so clear. Ooh!

44:20.325 --> 44:21.616
Don't worry, Mr. Peabody.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.118
I got it!
Sherman... Ahh!

44:23.202 --> 44:25.370
Oh!

44:38.760 --> 44:40.093
Hold that smile!

44:40.261 --> 44:42.262
Hold it right there!
No move! No move!

44:50.313 --> 44:53.023
Well, Leo, if my
calculations are correct...

44:53.191 --> 44:55.817
this machine of
ours should generate
enough centrifugal force...

44:55.985 --> 44:57.194
to send us home.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.780
I got one last piece
I gotta pound in place.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.116
Sherman, why don't
you fetch the hammer
for Mr. Da Vinci?

45:03.284 --> 45:05.118
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

45:09.791 --> 45:10.916
Mr. Peabody!

45:11.000 --> 45:12.125
Well done, Sherman.

45:12.293 --> 45:13.293
But, Mr. Peabody!

45:13.461 --> 45:14.795
Very helpful.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.477
Sherman!

45:30.978 --> 45:32.479
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

45:33.189 --> 45:34.398
The hammer.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.066
Da Vinci.

45:36.192 --> 45:38.610
Oh. Okay, Mr. Peabody.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.655
Oh!

45:42.490 --> 45:43.907
Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
Ahh!

45:44.075 --> 45:45.158
Do you need any help?

45:45.326 --> 45:47.160
No, no.
That's quite all right.

45:47.328 --> 45:48.829
Thank you.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.580
Psst! Sherman.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.333
Huh?
Let's go. Let's go explore.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.044
Uh, well, I'm supposed
to be having

45:56.170 --> 45:58.213
father-son time
with Mr. Peabody.

45:58.381 --> 46:00.048
Wouldn't you rather
have fun with me?

46:00.216 --> 46:01.383
Uh...

46:01.592 --> 46:02.634
Okay.

46:02.718 --> 46:03.760
Sherman...

46:03.928 --> 46:05.011
where are you going?

46:05.179 --> 46:06.263
Exploring.

46:06.431 --> 46:07.556
But we need your help.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.225
No, we don't!
I mean, we can manage.

46:10.393 --> 46:11.518
Somehow.

46:12.103 --> 46:13.395
He's a boy, Peabody.

46:13.563 --> 46:16.189
Let him have his fun.
Let him go.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.024
Thanks, Mr. Peabody!

46:21.612 --> 46:23.738
He's growing up, Peabody.

46:23.906 --> 46:26.950
Like a baby bird
leaving the nest.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.536
Isn't it wonderful?

46:36.544 --> 46:38.712
It's like a museum.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.048
It's like a toy store.

46:46.888 --> 46:48.555
Wow.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.560
Check this out.

46:53.728 --> 46:56.229
It's the world's
biggest model airplane.

46:56.397 --> 46:59.065
It's not a model, Penny.
It's a prototype.

46:59.233 --> 47:02.235
And we should probably
just leave that alone.

47:02.361 --> 47:03.361
Okay.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.489
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could fly it?

47:05.656 --> 47:07.657
I don't think
Mr. Peabody would like that.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.910
Well, Mr. Peabody
isn't here.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.620
Just tell me how it works.

47:11.787 --> 47:12.996
Please?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.456
For learning.

47:14.582 --> 47:16.291
Oh. Okay.

47:17.084 --> 47:20.253
The thrust comes from
this kind of crossbow
doohickey here.

47:20.421 --> 47:24.424
Then it shoots along
the track until the wind
catches the wings.

47:24.592 --> 47:26.343
But how does it go?
Huh?

47:26.511 --> 47:27.928
How do you take off?

47:28.095 --> 47:30.180
Oh, you just
pull down that lever.

47:31.432 --> 47:32.682
This one?

47:32.850 --> 47:33.975
Oh, boy.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.602
Ah!

47:38.022 --> 47:41.066
Wow! Whoo-hoo!

47:42.652 --> 47:44.277
This is crazy!

47:44.445 --> 47:46.696
No, it's not Sherman.
It's fun!

47:46.864 --> 47:48.156
We're gonna die!

47:48.324 --> 47:51.117
Oh, stop being
such a party pooper and
enjoy it!

47:56.457 --> 47:57.707
Ah...

47:57.792 --> 48:00.627
Nothing is as beautiful
as an elegant equation...

48:00.795 --> 48:03.463
translated into
perfect engineering.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.632
Why can't children be so simple?

48:05.800 --> 48:08.802
Because children
are not machines, Peabody.

48:08.970 --> 48:12.180
Believe me,
I tried to build one.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.474
Oh! It was creepy.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.520
Here, Sherman!
You fly it!

48:18.688 --> 48:19.980
But I don't want to fly!

48:20.147 --> 48:21.982
Sure you do. It'll be fun!

48:22.149 --> 48:24.734
No, seriously, Penny,
I don't want to!

48:24.902 --> 48:26.653
I'm letting go. One...

48:26.821 --> 48:27.862
Don't let go!

48:27.989 --> 48:28.989
Two...

48:29.073 --> 48:30.574
No!
Three!

48:33.828 --> 48:34.995
Penny, fly the plane!

48:35.496 --> 48:36.621
No, Sherman!

48:36.747 --> 48:37.987
You're going to have to save us!

48:37.999 --> 48:39.040
But I can't do it!

48:39.584 --> 48:42.419
I'm serious, Penny.
I don't know how to fly!

48:42.587 --> 48:44.337
You can do it!
I know you can!

48:44.505 --> 48:45.625
Come on, Sherman.

48:45.715 --> 48:46.715
Fly!

48:53.514 --> 48:54.931
Ah!

48:59.854 --> 49:01.438
Phew!

49:12.867 --> 49:14.868
See? You got this,
Sherman.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.746
You're right.
I have got this.

49:18.331 --> 49:20.206
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

49:26.380 --> 49:27.797
Da Vinci's at it again!

49:27.965 --> 49:29.549
You ever see that child he made?

49:29.717 --> 49:31.051
So creepy.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.761
Papa. Mama.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.430
Papa. Mama.

50:02.416 --> 50:03.833
All done up here, Leonardo.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.169
And I am all done down here.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.088
It is beautiful, isn't it?

50:08.255 --> 50:12.425
Every piece in its place
doing precisely what
it's supposed to do.

50:12.593 --> 50:14.010
Look, Peabody!

50:14.178 --> 50:16.096
It's my flying mach...

50:16.263 --> 50:17.597
My flying machine?

50:17.848 --> 50:18.848
Sherman.

50:18.933 --> 50:19.933
Sherman?

50:20.101 --> 50:22.352
Sherman, what are
you doing up there?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.937
I'm flying!

50:24.105 --> 50:26.731
But, Sherman,
you don't know how to fly!

50:26.816 --> 50:27.857
I don't?

50:27.942 --> 50:28.942
No!

50:35.449 --> 50:36.533
Turn!

50:36.617 --> 50:37.617
Turn, Sherman!

50:37.702 --> 50:39.828
Lean!

50:43.290 --> 50:45.125
Oh, no!

50:52.800 --> 50:53.883
Sherman?

50:53.968 --> 50:56.177
Sherman! Are you okay?

50:56.345 --> 50:59.013
That was pretty fantastic!

51:00.141 --> 51:02.350
Oh! I can't believe it!

51:03.310 --> 51:05.562
My flying machine!
It's work!

51:05.938 --> 51:10.108
Sherman!
You are the first flying man!

51:10.317 --> 51:12.193
Oh, you should be
very proud, Peabody.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.028
Very, very proud!

51:14.196 --> 51:16.322
"Proud" doesn't
begin to describe it.

51:18.159 --> 51:20.660
Leonardo, will you please
fire up the mechanism?

51:39.346 --> 51:42.932
Papa. Mama.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.893
Mona!

51:46.520 --> 51:47.520
Papa. Mama.

51:47.605 --> 51:48.605
The kid!

52:15.132 --> 52:17.717
I'm sorry I broke
the plane, Mr. Peabody.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.428
Well, you should be.
You could have been killed.

52:20.596 --> 52:21.930
What are you talking about?

52:22.097 --> 52:24.766
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!

52:24.934 --> 52:28.353
Sherman destroyed
a priceless
historical artifact.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.688
Whatever. You
should be happy.

52:30.856 --> 52:33.416
It turns out Sherman
is not a complete and
total loser, after all.

52:33.567 --> 52:34.776
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

52:34.860 --> 52:37.529
It turns out I'm not
a complete and
total loser, after all.

52:39.281 --> 52:40.323
Ms. Peterson...

52:40.407 --> 52:42.951
stop turning my son
into a hooligan.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.397
It's not my fault
he's a hooligan.

52:44.537 --> 52:47.038
Yeah, it's not her
fault I'm a hooligan.

52:47.206 --> 52:48.581
Well, it's certainly
not my fault!

52:48.749 --> 52:50.166
I've spent the last seven years

52:50.292 --> 52:51.709
teaching Sherman good judgment.

52:51.877 --> 52:52.919
If you're such a great parent...

52:53.003 --> 52:55.588
why is Ms. Grunion
trying to take
Sherman away from you?

52:58.634 --> 53:00.134
Is that true?

53:00.302 --> 53:02.387
Is someone gonna
take me away from you?

53:02.555 --> 53:04.889
No, Sherman,
I'll never let that happen.

53:05.057 --> 53:06.641
You just need to trust me.

53:06.809 --> 53:09.143
Oh, dear, a black hole!

53:14.900 --> 53:16.234
What's happening?

53:16.402 --> 53:17.682
If I can't pull
us out of here...

53:17.820 --> 53:20.780
we're going to be
smashed to smithereens
on the event horizon.

53:25.870 --> 53:28.580
There's not enough
power to resist
the gravitational pull!

53:28.998 --> 53:31.583
I've got to divert everything
to the reverse thrusters.

53:31.750 --> 53:32.750
Why didn't you tell me?

53:32.918 --> 53:33.918
Tell you what?

53:34.003 --> 53:35.461
Why didn't you
tell me Ms. Grunion

53:35.629 --> 53:37.046
was trying to take
me away from you?

53:37.381 --> 53:39.181
It's not your job to
worry about these things.

53:39.300 --> 53:40.860
You just didn't
think I could handle it.

53:41.010 --> 53:43.094
We'll discuss it later.
Now, sit down.

53:43.262 --> 53:45.138
I don't want to
discuss it later!

53:45.306 --> 53:46.639
Sherman, sit!

53:46.807 --> 53:48.725
You can't talk to me like that.

53:48.893 --> 53:50.143
I'm not a dog.

53:50.311 --> 53:51.519
What did you say?

53:51.687 --> 53:54.105
I said, I'm not a dog!

53:54.565 --> 53:56.774
You're right,
Sherman, you're not.

53:56.942 --> 53:59.235
You're just a very bad boy!

53:59.653 --> 54:01.613
T-minus 10...

54:01.780 --> 54:03.740
Nine, eight...

54:03.824 --> 54:04.908
Seven...

54:04.992 --> 54:05.992
Six...

54:06.035 --> 54:07.243
Five...

54:07.328 --> 54:09.120
Four, three...

54:09.955 --> 54:10.663
Two...

54:10.831 --> 54:11.831
One.

54:26.388 --> 54:27.472
Sherman?

54:27.973 --> 54:28.973
Penny?

54:29.350 --> 54:31.100
Sherman, are you okay?

54:34.438 --> 54:35.897
Sherman?

54:43.322 --> 54:44.989
He's gone.

54:45.157 --> 54:47.033
Where are we, anyway?

54:48.369 --> 54:49.702
Oh, no.

54:50.454 --> 54:53.164
We're on the brink
of one of history's
most ferocious conflicts...

55:08.931 --> 55:10.264
Delivery.

55:17.982 --> 55:20.358
How are we doing,
heroes of Greece?

55:20.526 --> 55:21.776
Feeling good?

55:21.944 --> 55:23.778
Feeling strong?

55:24.947 --> 55:26.531
Okay, let's get warmed up!

55:26.699 --> 55:28.366
We don't want to pull
something out there.

55:28.534 --> 55:30.368
Remember what
happened to Achilles.

55:30.536 --> 55:32.495
That whole thing with his heel.

55:34.415 --> 55:36.499
Looking good, Diomedes.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.584
Menelaus, my man!

55:38.794 --> 55:40.003
My man.

55:40.170 --> 55:42.422
Are you ready
to get on the field,
Shermanus?

55:42.589 --> 55:44.841
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.176
That's cute.

55:48.721 --> 55:50.430
Shh.

55:52.349 --> 55:55.351
Odysseus,
what news do you bring?

55:55.894 --> 55:57.645
Someone left this for us.

55:57.813 --> 55:59.063
A present. Nice.

55:59.231 --> 56:01.482
It looks just like our horse.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.360
Should I bring it inside?

56:05.738 --> 56:07.071
It would be rude not to.

56:12.453 --> 56:14.287
I did not see that coming!

56:14.788 --> 56:18.124
Ugh! Jeez Louise,
what is that smell?

56:18.333 --> 56:20.209
Oh!

56:20.294 --> 56:22.378
Ooh. That is
the smell of victory.

56:22.463 --> 56:24.756
Yeah! Victory!

56:24.923 --> 56:27.675
Greetings, men of
Athens, Sparta and Thebes.

56:27.843 --> 56:29.093
Peabody, here.

56:29.261 --> 56:30.845
I've come for Sherman.

56:31.013 --> 56:32.847
Do you know this guy?
I thought I did...

56:33.015 --> 56:34.474
but now I'm not so sure.

56:34.641 --> 56:36.768
Then he must be a spy.
Kill him!

56:36.935 --> 56:38.853
No! No!

56:39.521 --> 56:41.814
He's my dad.

56:41.982 --> 56:43.232
Your dad?
Huh?

56:43.400 --> 56:45.443
It's an adoptive relationship.

56:46.195 --> 56:47.612
Aw!

56:47.738 --> 56:50.698
Thank you for
taking such good care
of my son, Agamemnon...

56:50.866 --> 56:53.242
but it's time for
him to come home.

56:53.410 --> 56:56.079
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I've joined the Greek army.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.538
Shermanus is one of us now.

56:57.706 --> 56:58.946
He's a brother.
I'm his brother.

56:58.999 --> 56:59.999
He's my son.

57:00.084 --> 57:01.334
He took an oath.
I took an oath.

57:01.502 --> 57:02.502
He's seven!

57:02.795 --> 57:04.295
And a half!

57:04.630 --> 57:08.007
All sons must
prove themselves
to their fathers.

57:08.175 --> 57:08.841
Today...

57:09.134 --> 57:13.429
Shermanus will prove himself
on the field of battle.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.597
But he's only a child.

57:14.598 --> 57:17.642
Your dad may not think
you're ready to
become a man, Shermanus...

57:17.810 --> 57:18.851
but we do.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.019
Yeah!

57:20.062 --> 57:21.062
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

57:21.188 --> 57:22.980
Now, I'll show you
what I can handle.

57:23.148 --> 57:25.483
FYI, a lot of heroes
have father issues.

57:25.651 --> 57:27.068
My old man is a minotaur.

57:27.236 --> 57:30.363
Half man,
half bull, all judgment.

57:30.531 --> 57:32.657
Ajax, here, strongest
guy in the world...

57:32.825 --> 57:36.369
but his father never
accepted that his real
dream was to sing.

57:36.537 --> 57:38.287
I wanted to be
in the Greek chorus.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.535
Uh, yeah, and
don't even get me
started about Oedipus.

57:40.666 --> 57:42.500
Let's just say
that you do not want

57:42.626 --> 57:44.460
to be at his house
over the holidays.

57:44.628 --> 57:45.837
It's awkward.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.131
Sherman, I'm concerned
you haven't
thought this through.

57:48.298 --> 57:51.551
This is war.
Do you realize
what's about to happen?

57:51.844 --> 57:53.302
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.680
We're gonna
destroy their houses!

57:55.848 --> 57:57.181
Pull down their temples!

57:57.349 --> 58:00.393
And make the streets
of the city run red...

58:00.727 --> 58:02.562
with Trojan blood!

58:02.729 --> 58:03.813
Yeah!

58:04.231 --> 58:08.442
Blood!
Blood! Blood!

58:17.578 --> 58:19.287
Zeus on three! One!

58:19.454 --> 58:22.123
Sherman, I absolutely
forbid you to fight
in the Trojan War.

58:22.291 --> 58:25.084
It's not fair! All my
friends are fighting
in the Trojan War.

58:25.252 --> 58:26.836
Two!
Sherman, it's dangerous.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.045
I'm wearing a helmet.

58:28.213 --> 58:29.547
Three!
You're not going!

58:29.715 --> 58:30.798
Oh, yes, I am.

58:30.883 --> 58:32.592
Zeus!

58:33.302 --> 58:35.344
Zeus! Zeus!

58:37.848 --> 58:41.100
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dogs!

58:43.145 --> 58:45.271
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dog!

58:46.940 --> 58:48.774
Ahh!

58:58.577 --> 59:00.161
Well, that's cutting it close.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.749
This is why I ask you
to obey me, Sherman.

59:06.251 --> 59:10.004
Because I'm your father,
and it's my job
to keep you safe.

59:11.298 --> 59:14.258
But are you sure
Ms. Grunion won't
take me away?

59:16.011 --> 59:17.887
Not as long as I'm around.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.234
Mr. Peabody!

59:31.401 --> 59:32.902
Help me!

59:33.737 --> 59:34.737
Penny!

59:42.287 --> 59:44.080
Smell my victory!

59:44.248 --> 59:45.706
Smell it!

59:45.874 --> 59:48.251
Hey! That's my ride!

59:55.175 --> 59:56.175
Mr. Peabody...

59:56.176 --> 59:57.426
hurry!

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.347
I'll take that.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.022
You did it, Sherman!

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.273
Mr. Peabody helped.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:53.983
Now, let's get to
the WABAC, go home,

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.693
un-hypnotize
Penny's parents...

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.069
finish that dinner party,
eat my Baked Alaska...

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.557
charm the pants
off Ms. Grunion...

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.948
and make sure none
of this ever happens
in the first place.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:02.908
Sounds good.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.076
I'm in.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.578
Ah!

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.081
Sherman!

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.250
Penny!
Sherman, no!

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.095
Whoa!

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.562
Mr. Peabody...

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.273
Mr. Peabody?

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:40.654
Mr. Peabody!

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.657
Dad!

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:58.047
Oh, Mr. Peabody!
What should I do?
What should I do?

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.761
There's nothing
you can do, Sherman.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.849
I just want to go home.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.186
Home.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:14.814
That's it.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.066
I got an idea.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.901
Come on!

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:21.779
Where are we gonna go?

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.114
We're going home.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.199
There's only one person
who can help us...

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.909
and that's Mr. Peabody.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.662
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.110
We've got a time machine, Penny!

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.040
I can set it so
that we'll get home

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.000
when Mr. Peabody
is still there.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.657
But I thought
you're not supposed

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:37.962
to go back to a time
when you existed.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.630
What choice do we have?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:44.760
Error.
You are attempting to travel
to an era in which you exist.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.568
This could alter
the fabric of space-time.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.058
Error. Error.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.935
Hang on!

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.278
This is fun!

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:08.451
This is a little
homespun concoction
I like to call...

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.036
"Einstein on the Beach."

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.538
Yummy.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:15.958
To the kids.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.918
To the kids!

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:20.337
Mr. Peabody.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:21.922
Sherman? Penny?

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.424
Can we talk to you a second?

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:24.383
Of course.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:25.843
Excuse me.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.431
I've really hit it off
with your parents.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:33.767
I think we can file
this night under
"Unqualified Success."

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:36.353
I'd hold off
filing it just yet.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:37.313
What do you mean?

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.815
Why are you two dressed
like ancient Greeks?

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.484
You used the WABAC!
I did.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.277
I know, it's terrible!

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.445
But why?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.688
Penny and I got
into an argument
about George Washington.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:47.978
So, I made him
show me the WABAC.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.396
And I lost her in ancient Egypt.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.618
And I got engaged to King Tut.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.453
So, I came back
and got you.
Then we ran out of gas.

01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:54.246
In Florence.
Went into a black hole.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.998
And then you died
in ancient Troy.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.417
Died? I have a hard
time believing that.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.585
It's true!

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.046
But now you're here,
and everything's
gonna be okay.

01:04:02.214 --> 01:04:04.215
I told you never to come back
to a time when you existed...

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.758
because there
would be two of you!

01:04:05.926 --> 01:04:08.385
Yeah, but the other one
of me is in ancient Egypt.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.265
Ahh!

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:14.391
Who are you?

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.227
He's you, but
from another timeline.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:19.480
But I thought you said
never to come back to
a time when you existed.

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:21.315
Exactly!
I know.

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.569
But what was I supposed
to do? Mr. Peabody
died in ancient Troy.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.487
Died?

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:28.197
I have a hard time
believing that.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.365
Thank you.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:30.783
What are we going to do?

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:33.244
Well, for starters,
both Shermans
can't stay here.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:34.745
Why? We could
get bunk beds.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.113
I was thinking the same thing.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.748
That's so weird.
It's like we're twins!

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:38.832
I was thinking that, too!

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.334
Ow!

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:43.295
You see? We can't
have two Shermans in
the same timeline.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.882
It puts too much strain
on the space-time continuum.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.884
What to do?
The Petersons

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.344
can't know any of this.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:51.929
Hey, Pea-buddy.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.639
Hey.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:54.765
How's it going?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.518
Patty and I are
working up an appetite.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.104
Mmm. The smells
coming from your
kitchen are yummy!

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:02.398
Especially that Baked Alaska.

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:04.358
So, what's going on here?

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.859
Yeah, what's with the getups?

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.736
Toga party!

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.446
Toga party?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.117
Yes, it is a toga party!

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:14.535
Well, what about dinner?

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:15.703
I'm starving.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:16.996
Why don't we head
into the dining room...

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.243
and tuck into those quails
you've been yakking about?

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.249
No!
Why not?

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:24.128
Because it's so fun right here!

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:27.089
Whoo-hoo!

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.222
Ms. Grunion!

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.016
How delightful.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.767
We were having
such a good time...

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.295
I almost forgot
you were coming.
Oh!

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:41.979
Well, why don't
you join the party?

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.733
I'm not here for a party.
I'm here for
the investigation.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.153
Good. Why don't
you start investigating
over here?

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:52.281
Or here, or here, or here...

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.033
Stop waving your hands around!

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:57.786
Sherman?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.622
Wait! Is that...?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.415
Sherman!

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.752
Dos Shermanos? What's
going on here, Peabody?

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:07.254
Oh...

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:08.505
Um...

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.757
Nobody move!

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:13.260
Sherman, I've got to
get you out of here
before you touch yourself.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.306
Mr. Peabody!
You didn't die!

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.932
Of course I didn't die.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.184
Thank you.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.269
Hey. How did you get back?

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:24.063
Well, after a few
failed experiments...

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.440
I hit upon a combination
of bones, stone
and yak fat...

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.609
and constructed
a rudimentary WABAC.

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:29.777
You know what they say...

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.113
"If at first
you don't succeed,
Troy, Troy again."

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.949
This is no time for puns!
Even good ones.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.576
Penny, Sherman, quickly!

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.620
You're not going anywhere.

01:06:39.788 --> 01:06:42.039
I've seen quite enough
to remove the boy...

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.625
both boys,
from this home.

01:06:44.793 --> 01:06:47.670
No, don't,
Ms. Grunion, please!

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:50.964
This is all my fault.
I started it.

01:06:52.092 --> 01:06:53.676
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:57.554
You have nothing
to apologize for, Penny.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.390
A dog should never
have been allowed

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.183
to adopt a boy
in the first place.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.476
Now, come along.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:04.103
Ms. Grunion,
be careful!

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.397
Ah! Oh!

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.481
What's happening?

01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:14.488
Mr. Peabody, help!

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:15.823
Sherman!
Sherman!

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:21.453
Oh!

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.463
Hey! Where did
the other two go?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:36.218
Our cosmic doubles
combined in order to
reconcile a paradox...

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:39.012
in the space-time continuum.

01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:40.931
Okay, that makes sense.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.350
I don't know what
just happened here...

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:46.228
but I know it was wrong!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.105
This boy is coming with me!
Mr. Peabody!

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.732
No, Ms. Grunion!
Ow! Let me go!

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:50.941
Get back here!

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:53.360
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me!

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:57.781
Oh! Oh!

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:03.495
He bit me!

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:06.749
He bit me!

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.877
Yes, hello, police.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.962
I'd like to report an assault.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.130
A bite.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.382
Mr. Peabody,
what are we gonna do?

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.029
Get here
as soon as possible.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.135
Run!

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.720
He's kidnapping
the children! Oh!

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:25.517
I can't believe
you bit her, Mr. Peabody!

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.435
I know, Sherman, it was wrong.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.312
"Wrong"?

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.147
It was awesome!

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:33.734
And now, to return
to our proper timeline
and erase this mess.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:41.158
There he is!
He's got my daughter
in that giant space apple!

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.209
My face is numb.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:53.837
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.298
What's wrong?

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.220
Time travel failed.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.680
Oh, dear.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.015
What is it,
Mr. Peabody?

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.142
Our cosmic doubles colliding...

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.950
ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.395
That's why we didn't
get to the past.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.609
Hey, Peabody!

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:18.737
Looks like the past
is coming to us.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.825
Oof! I will get you, dog!

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:24.910
And your little boy, too!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.580
Penny!

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:29.747
My bride!

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.586
What?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.550
Oh, dear.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.560
Follow that orb!

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.283
Incoming!

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.788
What sort of creature are you?

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.791
The name is Grunion!

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.712
I'm in love!

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:21.675
I just need to find a wormhole.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.809
Hey, Einstein, it's a red light.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.853
Hey, I'm walking, here!

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.480
Cake!

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.107
Mmm!

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.571
There they go.
Don't lose them.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.203
I'm trying to find
another wormhole...

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.246
but they all lead
back to the present!

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.664
Time travel failed.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.833
Time travel failed.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.715
Whoo!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.967
There he is. After them!

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.803
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.848
We're coming, Shermanus!

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:14.935
Time travel failed.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.021
Mr. Peabody!

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:17.189
Look out!

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.692
Whoa!

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:27.908
Shermanus, hold on.

01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.035
We shall release
you from this egg.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:35.916
Drop the saber
and step away from
the futuristic orb.

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:38.251
I take orders from no man!

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:48.053
Don't tase me, bro.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.597
Come out, Peabody,
with your paws in the air.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.977
Mr. Peabody,
you're under arrest...

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.270
for kidnapping,
reckless endangerment...

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.732
And a multiplicity
of major traffic violations.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900
You don't understand.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:04.236
There's a rip
in the space-time continuum!

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:06.363
If you arrest me,
I won't be able to fix...

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.532
Blah, blah, blah.
For too long...

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.576
you've bamboozled the world
with your fancy jargon...

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:12.911
and that little
red tie of yours...

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.413
and look what's come of it.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.580
Take him away!

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.665
Wait.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:18.834
Mr. Peabody!

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:19.876
Sherman!

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.797
What's gonna happen
to Mr. Peabody?

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:26.925
Don't you know
what happens to
dogs that bite?

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.593
Let me go.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.041
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.180
Please, before it's too late.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.765
Wait!

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:35.767
Give him another chance.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:39.688
He's through with chances.
Now, he has to pay
for his mistakes.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.648
But I'm the one
who made all
the mistakes.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:44.568
I'm the one
who used the WABAC
without permission.

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:47.612
The only mistake
Mr. Peabody ever made...

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:49.948
was me.

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:52.534
Sherman.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.287
You're absolutely
right, Sherman.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:59.583
What kind of a father
could this dog
ever be to a boy?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.171
Maybe you're right,
Ms. Grunion.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.548
But there's one thing
you haven't considered.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:07.799
What's that?

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.344
I'm a dog, too!

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.974
If being a dog
means you're like
Mr. Peabody...

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.934
who never turns
his back on you...

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:20.979
and who's always there
to pick you up
when you fall...

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:25.275
and loves you no matter
how many times you mess up...

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.736
if that's what it
means to be a dog...

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.114
then, yeah, I'm a dog, too!

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:37.913
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:40.874
I'm a dog, too!

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.292
I'm a dog as well!

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:43.919
A poodle dog!

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:46.004
I am a dog, too.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.672
Ditto on that dog thing!

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.344
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.012
I am a dog as well.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.305
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.556
I'm a dog, too.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.526
I'm a dog, too.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.785
I'm Spartacus!

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:21.164
All right, fine,
you're all dogs, but
you can't change the law.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.208
I know someone who can.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.048
George Washington.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:31.466
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:37.264
that all men, and some dogs,
are created equal.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:42.352
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.603
Me, too.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.063
I've done worse.

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.073
Huh?

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:00.787
Uh, Mr. Peabody, look!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.836
Ahh!

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.505
Ooh!

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.260
It's getting closer!

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.720
What are we going to do?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.377
This is the greatest
collection of geniuses
ever assembled!

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:22.309
Surely we can come
up with another way
of getting to the past.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.102
I can build a catapult.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.729
We go very fast.

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:28.982
But, remember,
as you approach
the speed of light...

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.276
gravity will get too strong.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.779
Oh, indeed. "For every
action, there is an equal
and opposite reaction."

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:38.575
How about we just punch
that big hole in the face?

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:49.252
I have an idea.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.380
Hey, everybody, I have an idea!

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:53.673
Yes, what is it, Sherman?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.760
Why not go to the future?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.261
The future?

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:02.807
I've never been there
before, so it's probably
not as messed up.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.143
Sherman, that's it!

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:06.978
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:08.355
Not usually.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:10.815
It's exactly what
you all just said...

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.235
except the total opposite!

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.364
If we set
the WABAC for the future,
and go very, very fast...

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.741
we'll create our own
gravitational field...

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.701
that's equal and opposite...

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:25.163
to the rip in
the space-time continuum!

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.083
Oh, my...

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.626
I don't get it.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:33.380
We're gonna fly up there
and punch that big
hole in the face!

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:34.798
Yes!

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.469
Sherman, you're a genius.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.097
But, Peabody...

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.891
how far into
the future must you go?

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:46.851
Just a few seconds
ought to do it,

01:16:46.978 --> 01:16:48.728
and then we'll
slingshot right back.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.772
Are you sure this
is going to work?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.399
Don't worry, Penny.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.651
Just remember,
I'm a...

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.445
Genius!

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.738
Sherman...

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.657
I need to reprogram the WABAC.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:01.908
All right, Mr. Peabody.

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:04.119
That means you have to drive.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.952
In order to make the leap
into the future...

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:36.860
the WABAC will
have to go very fast.

01:17:37.028 --> 01:17:38.820
Faster than it's
ever gone before!

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.906
Are you ready, Sherman?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.408
I'm ready.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.664
Come on, Sherman, you can do it.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.093
Now, Mr. Peabody?

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.012
Sherman, we need more speed.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:08.475
Now?

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.268
Just a little more!

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:14.230
Not yet, Sherman.

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:15.398
Not yet.

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:17.484
Now!

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.354
Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.106
Farewell!

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.740
Ooh!

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.076
You haven't seen
the last of me,
Peabody.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.454
You'll make
a mistake eventually,
and when you do...

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.790
I'll be there!

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.583
The Grunion is mine!
Ooh!

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:39.441
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.048
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.909
If you want
to watch television
before I get home...

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.077
simply press
"input" three times...

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.454
and then use
the remote control
as usual.

01:20:34.622 --> 01:20:35.622
Yes, Sherman.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.269
And if you're worried
about making friends
at the PTA meeting...

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:39.876
consider bringing
snacks for everyone.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.711
Bagels are always appreciated.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.213
Yes, Sherman.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:45.924
And remember,
Mr. Peabody...

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:49.010
I have robotics club
after school today.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.554
Sherman, wait.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:53.473
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.518
I...

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.146
I love you, Sherman.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.111
I have a deep regard
for you as well,
Mr. Peabody.

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:19.874
Hey, Mr. Peabody!

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.125
Hey, Sherman!

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:22.502
Wait up!

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:26.839
No doubt about it.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.509
Every dog should have a boy.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.532
Oh!

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.829
Ooh!

01:21:57.913 --> 01:21:59.664
Ah!

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.543
A-ha!

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:20.893
I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.271
You may kiss the Grunion.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:26.816
Come here, soldier.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.334
There's always time for living

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:47.712
Can we just do it again?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:54.719
One more time
like it once was
way back when

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:58.973
You gave me
something to believe in

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.602
We were the best of friends

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:09.525
Well, I remember
the good times
way back when

01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:20.995
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:28.002
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:30.713
We're superheroes and villains

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:34.008
When we used to pretend

01:23:35.094 --> 01:23:41.182
We'd go wherever our minds
would take us way back when

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.108
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:57.448
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:04.872
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:12.463
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.591
'Cause you're on your own

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:19.470
You're not alone

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:26.436
I know I'll see you again Again

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.732
And if all these things

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:34.444
Come to an end

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:39.991
We'll always have
a way back when

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.085
Memories will fade
if you wanted me
to let you go

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:58.676
I've got you on your way
I feel it for you,
don't you know

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:05.558
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:13.900
I know we'll be okay
This luck we have,
it cannot go
