02:22.972 --> 02:24.056
It's observation.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.143
Secure the grounds.
Make sure no one enters or leaves.

03:00.842 --> 03:04.721
Take good care of these, Sylvester Grogan,
whoever you are.

03:05.138 --> 03:07.140
I'll be looking you up at the Le Baron.

03:29.412 --> 03:30.872
The crystals!

03:39.380 --> 03:40.506
Move aside.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.802
The collimating crystals are gone.

03:45.344 --> 03:49.473
No. Call the IADC, then call the police.

03:50.349 --> 03:51.433
Right.

05:14.223 --> 05:16.391
Mr. Mac Freeman,
please come to the desk.

05:16.475 --> 05:18.769
Mr. Mac Freeman,
please come to the main desk.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.942
Mr. Genteel,
please pick up the house phone.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.030
That's right, sir.

05:30.113 --> 05:32.908
Fire regulations prohibit 10 people...

05:32.991 --> 05:35.160
from sleeping in a single room.

05:38.288 --> 05:39.665
May I...

05:39.748 --> 05:42.000
I'm sorry. May I help you?

05:42.209 --> 05:45.587
Yes. My name is Diana Prince
and I believe I have a reservation.

05:45.671 --> 05:47.089
- Prince?
- Yes.

05:49.258 --> 05:51.718
You're not here
for the convention, are you?

05:51.802 --> 05:55.848
- That's what this is, a convention?
- Yes. The science fiction convention.

05:55.931 --> 05:58.183
It's being held at Paragon Studios
down the street.

05:58.267 --> 06:01.519
And we have the misfortune
of being the closest hotel.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.354
Why is it being held at a studio?

06:03.437 --> 06:06.774
Paragon Studios is bringing back
its old Space Quest series.

06:06.858 --> 06:08.943
The convention is part of their promotion.

06:09.026 --> 06:11.863
If you'll please be patient with me,
Ms. Prince...

06:11.946 --> 06:14.615
I'm sure your reservation
is here somewhere.

06:15.324 --> 06:17.743
I'm beginning to hope it isn't.

07:04.164 --> 07:06.833
You were running a six-minute mile,
Mr. Kimball.

07:06.917 --> 07:10.003
But then again, it never hurts
for a thief to be fleet of foot.

07:10.086 --> 07:11.922
Wouldn't want to shortchange a client.

07:12.005 --> 07:13.215
Speaking of clients...

07:13.298 --> 07:16.218
I was expecting a delivery last night.
Where were you?

07:16.301 --> 07:18.178
Had nothing to deliver.

07:18.386 --> 07:21.389
I know the crystals were stolen
from the observatory last night.

07:21.473 --> 07:24.142
- Where are they?
- They're safe and sound.

07:24.559 --> 07:25.810
No thanks to you.

07:25.894 --> 07:27.979
The alarm system layout
you provided for me...

07:28.063 --> 07:29.147
wasn't exactly up to date.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.484
Once again, Mr. Kimball,
what did you do with the crystals?

07:32.651 --> 07:35.277
I think they're on their way
out of the complex by now.

07:35.361 --> 07:37.321
You left them there?

07:37.696 --> 07:40.658
I didn't think it would look too good
if they were found on me.

07:40.741 --> 07:42.618
You don't seem to understand,
Mr. Kimball.

07:42.701 --> 07:46.497
There are big people involved
and I hired you to get me the crystals.

07:46.831 --> 07:48.499
Look, you'll get the crystals.

07:48.582 --> 07:50.668
- When?
- When I catch up with them.

07:52.294 --> 07:55.840
You hired the best, Mr. Rohan.
You'll get the crystals.

07:56.715 --> 07:58.843
Indeed I shall, Mr. Kimball.

07:59.051 --> 08:02.388
Because of you, or in spite of you.

08:08.811 --> 08:11.897
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a few more miles to run.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.369
I said collimating crystals, Diana.

08:26.452 --> 08:29.581
They were developed for lasers
used in space navigation.

08:29.747 --> 08:33.126
They were on loan to the observatory.
Up until last night, that is.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.878
So you got me on a 6:00 a. m. flight...

08:34.961 --> 08:38.214
just because something that tells
how far away the moon is was stolen?

08:38.298 --> 08:40.717
Collimating crystals
concentrate laser beams...

08:40.799 --> 08:43.052
meaning that in the wrong hands, Diana...

08:43.135 --> 08:47.015
small tactical laser weapons
are not only possible, but very practical.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.393
And you want me to find out
whose hands they've fallen into.

08:50.476 --> 08:51.561
Right.

08:51.644 --> 08:54.564
You got the file of suspects
I sent to the airport, didn't you?

08:54.647 --> 08:56.107
Yes. I studied it on the plane.

08:56.191 --> 08:58.401
Most of the second-story men
you've singled out...

08:58.485 --> 09:00.612
I've had some dealings with before.

09:02.071 --> 09:03.656
No, it's all right.

09:03.740 --> 09:04.866
Thank you.

09:05.700 --> 09:06.993
Diana?

09:07.076 --> 09:08.745
- That's another thing, Steve.
- Let me help.

09:08.828 --> 09:13.248
You booked me into a hotel
filled with science-fiction conventioneers.

09:13.749 --> 09:17.085
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
The Torrence people suggested that hotel.

09:17.169 --> 09:19.713
Have you been to the observatory yet?

09:20.506 --> 09:22.674
First things first. Sylvester?

09:23.091 --> 09:25.844
- Diana Prince.
- Sylvester Grogan.

09:27.054 --> 09:28.555
What a pleasant surprise.

09:28.639 --> 09:31.266
- Dr. Grogan's son is there?
- Yeah.

09:31.934 --> 09:33.143
What are you doing here?

09:33.227 --> 09:36.730
I'm in charge
of the C-6 Club moon-rock exhibit.

09:36.813 --> 09:38.982
- The science fiction convention?
- Yeah.

09:39.066 --> 09:42.820
Dad arranged it so we could borrow
the Torrence moon-rock collection.

09:43.570 --> 09:45.280
You here for the convention, too?

09:45.364 --> 09:48.659
No. I'm on an assignment.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.619
He's gone into the hotel.

10:33.703 --> 10:36.497
Perhaps, he's trying to find
a higher bidder.

10:36.747 --> 10:39.584
It's going to be a pleasure
eliminating that arrogant fool...

10:39.667 --> 10:41.335
once this is over.

10:43.045 --> 10:44.422
Follow him.

10:45.006 --> 10:47.340
Sooner or later he'll lead us
to the crystals.

10:47.424 --> 10:48.508
All right.

10:51.052 --> 10:53.805
I'll call you when I get back
from the observatory.

10:53.889 --> 10:56.016
- All right. Goodbye.
- Bye.

11:00.645 --> 11:02.814
All those guys in there are spies, or what?

11:02.898 --> 11:05.942
Let's say they're not exactly
upstanding citizens.

11:07.319 --> 11:09.738
First, where can I find
the Space Questicon...

11:09.821 --> 11:12.657
and second, what the heck is it?

11:14.117 --> 11:17.329
- Diana, what is it?
- Do me a big favor, Sylvester...

11:17.412 --> 11:20.373
and have the desk clerk send this up
with my luggage. Okay?

11:20.457 --> 11:22.959
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Sylvester.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.296
Hey, call me Sly! Remember?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.328
Can I give you a hand, Mr. Kimball?

12:43.079 --> 12:44.747
That's very kind of you.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.000
I was wondering when we'd meet again.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.461
Looks like you've already set up shop.
You have business here?

12:50.712 --> 12:53.464
- Just attending the convention.
- I see.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.425
Then you won't mind that Diana Prince...

12:55.508 --> 12:57.802
wanted me to ask you a few questions.

12:57.886 --> 13:00.597
Mostly about
some stolen laser equipment.

13:01.806 --> 13:03.600
You won't have to use that.

13:03.975 --> 13:07.604
But you will have to do something
that you've never done before.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.855
Really?

13:08.938 --> 13:10.606
And what's that, Mr. Kimball?

13:10.689 --> 13:11.899
Catch me.

13:31.376 --> 13:33.378
Kimball, you wouldn't.

13:33.462 --> 13:34.713
Sorry.

13:57.819 --> 14:00.696
You've never been
to a science fiction convention before?

14:00.780 --> 14:03.032
I'm only going now
because something here...

14:03.115 --> 14:05.660
- apparently ties into my assignment.
- Really?

14:06.911 --> 14:09.330
The convention doesn't really start
until tonight...

14:09.413 --> 14:10.957
with the masquerade contest.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.501
- Right now they're just setting up.
- I see.

14:15.002 --> 14:17.296
- What are they doing?
- Those are Logies.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.215
Logan's Run fans.

14:19.465 --> 14:23.511
He's a Sandman. The girls are Runners.
They chase each other periodically.

14:24.595 --> 14:27.431
They're probably practicing
for a big run tonight.

14:27.807 --> 14:30.309
Tomorrow we're gonna have
continuous movies...

14:30.393 --> 14:33.312
and panels with your favorite actors
and authors...

14:33.396 --> 14:35.523
and a blood drive for charity.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.817
- What?
- A blood drive for charity.

14:38.693 --> 14:41.195
- Hi, Janet.
- Hi, Ester.

14:43.906 --> 14:46.533
And we'll also have
all these various exhibits.

14:46.616 --> 14:49.953
In fact, we ought to go see
my exhibit right now...

14:50.036 --> 14:51.454
- before it's mobbed.
- Well, I-

14:51.538 --> 14:53.665
Come on. You'll love it.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.294
Basically, everything's under control.

14:57.419 --> 14:59.462
Don't forget to try to find that white glue.

14:59.546 --> 15:01.089
I still got prizes to put together.

15:08.430 --> 15:12.017
Excuse me. Could you tell me
where I might find a Sylvester Grogan?

15:12.100 --> 15:15.353
Ester. He just went...
There he is, right there.

15:18.356 --> 15:22.611
- We call him Ester. I'll get him. Hey-
- That's all right. He looks busy.

15:23.570 --> 15:25.739
He must be showing her his exhibit.

15:25.989 --> 15:27.741
Wonder where he picked her up?

15:27.824 --> 15:30.118
- Old Ester got lucky.
- I'll say.

15:40.294 --> 15:42.004
Why is the floor moving?

15:42.087 --> 15:45.549
It's a simulation of space travel.
It's neat, huh?

15:45.716 --> 15:48.511
It's fantastic,
but how about turning the lights back on?

15:48.594 --> 15:50.304
- Please.
- Okay.

15:54.266 --> 15:56.852
A rocking floor and spinning lights.

15:57.061 --> 15:59.188
Really impressive, Sylvester.

15:59.313 --> 16:01.232
- These are moon rocks, huh?
- Yep.

16:01.315 --> 16:04.485
Using the special effects to display them
was my idea.

16:05.778 --> 16:09.949
See, the C-6 Club is trying
to stimulate interest in space colonies.

16:10.282 --> 16:12.952
So we thought it was only appropriate
that our exhibit...

16:13.035 --> 16:15.788
showed what space travel was really like.

16:18.290 --> 16:21.042
Please, Sylvester,
enough with the lights. Okay?

16:21.251 --> 16:22.335
Okay.

16:26.714 --> 16:30.176
It pays to have a dad who's
a heavyweight in the space program.

16:30.677 --> 16:34.305
The Torrence folks lent us the display case
as well as the moon rocks.

16:34.389 --> 16:35.515
Impressed?

16:35.932 --> 16:37.433
And late, I'm afraid.

16:38.184 --> 16:40.311
I warned you
I didn't have very long, Sylvester.

16:40.395 --> 16:41.688
Sly.

16:42.897 --> 16:45.608
- Okay, I'll walk you back to the hotel.
- Good.

16:47.443 --> 16:49.195
I was afraid you were going to do this.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.614
Here. This way.

16:58.163 --> 17:01.082
Watch out for anybody
with overly large handbags...

17:01.166 --> 17:04.002
or suspicious-looking umbrellas.

17:04.460 --> 17:07.297
If you have any problems,
you can page me in the main area.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.299
Sylvester, I think that he can handle it.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.884
Right.

17:14.595 --> 17:17.263
The masquerade contest tonight
is gonna be a real trip.

17:17.347 --> 17:19.641
I'm sure you'll have a ball.

17:26.315 --> 17:29.276
Janet, the Black A venger's just arrived
at the hotel.

17:33.655 --> 17:35.949
Way to go. You just ignited a mob.

17:36.033 --> 17:38.827
They should be at the hotel
in about two minutes.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.413
That's quite a panic.

17:41.747 --> 17:44.666
They'll never find him.
He's not in his costume yet.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.169
Nobody knows what he looks like
without his costume.

17:47.252 --> 17:49.505
- It's his trademark.
- Really?

17:53.008 --> 17:55.344
No, I can't give out
the Black Avenger's room number.

17:55.427 --> 17:58.054
I can't give you
Robby the Robot's room number, either...

17:58.137 --> 17:59.972
so stop pestering me!

18:02.850 --> 18:06.270
I'm here to see the Black Avenger.
My secretary gave me his room number.

18:06.354 --> 18:08.856
I seem to have misplaced it.
Here's my card.

18:09.565 --> 18:11.150
You're with Paragon Studios?

18:11.234 --> 18:12.485
Casting department. Features.

18:12.568 --> 18:14.821
Working on a three-pic deal
with the Black Avenger.

18:14.904 --> 18:17.365
I have strict instructions
not to give out any-

18:17.448 --> 18:19.325
- Left-handed Willie.
- What?

18:19.408 --> 18:21.661
Part I've been trying to cast
for three weeks.

18:21.744 --> 18:23.496
You're perfect for it. Ever acted?

18:23.579 --> 18:24.664
In fact...

18:24.747 --> 18:27.250
I have done a couple of commercials.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.752
When can you come in for a test?
Tuesday okay?

18:29.836 --> 18:31.462
Wednesday's my day off.

18:31.546 --> 18:35.341
Wednesday it is. 3:00.
Stage 24. Ask for me.

18:39.095 --> 18:40.429
Room number?

18:40.721 --> 18:42.515
The Presidential Suite.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.349
Thanks. You're beautiful.

18:44.808 --> 18:48.270
Thank you, Mr. Mackleheimer?

19:36.901 --> 19:39.236
No. Take a nice long look at yourself.

19:39.528 --> 19:41.989
It'll be the last one you get for a while.

20:04.428 --> 20:06.514
No more games, Kimball.

20:27.116 --> 20:29.619
He's wearing this stupid costume,
isn't he?

20:39.629 --> 20:42.549
- Simon Rohan?
- He has a long history of arrests.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.093
Usually associated with military secrets.

20:45.593 --> 20:47.387
Last year it was in Albany.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.639
"lllegal sales of radioactive isotopes.

20:49.722 --> 20:52.142
"Charges dropped
because of insufficient evidence. "

20:52.225 --> 20:53.935
Yes. I know Rohan, Steve.

20:54.018 --> 20:55.478
I ran into him last spring...

20:55.562 --> 20:58.148
when he was arranging
to bug the UN Committee Room.

20:58.231 --> 21:01.442
What makes you connect him
with missing collimating crystals?

21:01.526 --> 21:03.319
Because he is presently in Los Angeles.

21:03.403 --> 21:05.530
Rumor has it
that he has engaged the services...

21:05.613 --> 21:08.615
of a professional burglar.
And we both know who that probably is.

21:08.699 --> 21:11.994
Yes. One Mr. Kimball.

21:12.578 --> 21:15.581
I'm going to need a photograph of Rohan
to leave with the desk clerk...

21:15.664 --> 21:17.541
in case he does come around here.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.252
I'll have the FBl
wire you a photo right away.

21:20.335 --> 21:23.255
Okay. Give my regards to Ira.

21:23.338 --> 21:25.507
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay. Bye.

21:44.735 --> 21:47.362
Her name is Diana Prince,
and yes, you have seen her.

21:47.446 --> 21:49.239
Last year in New York.

21:49.656 --> 21:53.285
The collimating crystals are one
of the government's pet projects.

21:53.368 --> 21:56.412
I fully expected the IADC
to send someone out.

21:57.205 --> 22:00.041
Unfortunately, she's one
of their best operatives.

22:01.167 --> 22:04.504
By now she probably has an inkling
that I'm involved in this.

22:04.962 --> 22:07.924
What do I do? I got a fix on Kimball.

22:08.174 --> 22:11.010
Soon as he goes for the crystals,
boom, I'm there.

22:11.385 --> 22:12.470
But what about her?

22:12.553 --> 22:16.641
Perhaps, you should create
a terminal diversion for Ms. Prince.

22:24.023 --> 22:25.650
I'm sorry. I have no pen.

22:25.733 --> 22:28.402
Mr. Avenger! Mr. Avenger, sir.

22:28.694 --> 22:31.405
Of your series, what was
your favorite episode?

22:32.824 --> 22:35.535
My favorite episode. Yes.

22:36.702 --> 22:39.539
That would be the one where the guy
with the pointy nose...

22:39.622 --> 22:42.792
- falls into the fifth dimension.
- That wasn't your show.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.377
Leroy Leonard's never been on your show.

22:46.253 --> 22:48.755
- We just shot it.
- Wait a minute.

22:48.839 --> 22:52.676
I know for a fact that Leroy Leonard
just finished two films back-to-back.

22:52.759 --> 22:55.428
He couldn't possibly have had time
to be on your show.

22:55.512 --> 22:56.763
Right.

22:56.847 --> 22:58.890
He worked for us on his days off.

22:58.974 --> 23:02.227
Does anybody here know
where I could find Sylvester Grogan?

23:09.234 --> 23:11.194
Sylvester Grogan?

23:12.529 --> 23:13.989
The Black Avenger!

23:14.656 --> 23:16.408
What an honor, sir.

23:17.242 --> 23:19.202
I'm your biggest fan.

23:19.286 --> 23:21.079
I've seen all your shows at least twice.

23:21.163 --> 23:23.582
My favorite one is where the guy
with the three ears...

23:23.665 --> 23:25.667
falls into the fifth dimension.

23:27.169 --> 23:29.546
Would you like some C-6 literature?

23:30.046 --> 23:31.256
Some what?

23:31.339 --> 23:35.551
C-6. It's a club lobbying world
governments to build cities in space.

23:36.093 --> 23:37.636
Here, you can read all about it.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.182
Sylvester,
I'll tell you what I'd really like.

23:41.390 --> 23:44.143
I'd like a little tour
of your moon-rock exhibit.

23:44.226 --> 23:46.020
I understand it's really remarkable.

23:46.103 --> 23:49.190
- It's from the Torrence observatory, right?
- Yes, sir!

23:50.441 --> 23:53.694
Could you wait right here just a second,
Mr. Avenger, sir?

23:54.111 --> 23:55.279
Janet!

23:57.281 --> 24:00.784
Be a sweetheart, please, and watch
the table, just for a second, okay?

24:03.078 --> 24:04.163
Excuse me.

24:04.788 --> 24:05.956
Right this way.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.000
- Thanks, Janet.
- Sure, Ester.

24:09.210 --> 24:10.461
Sly.

24:11.253 --> 24:12.505
This way.

24:16.467 --> 24:19.261
- The floor is tilting.
- Yeah, it's supposed to.

24:21.221 --> 24:23.640
Do you think I could see it
with the lights on?

24:23.723 --> 24:25.892
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.936
Here.

24:30.313 --> 24:31.606
Impressive.

24:32.148 --> 24:34.901
I still get chills looking at these rocks.

24:34.984 --> 24:37.320
Knowing they come from a place
that wasn't touched...

24:37.403 --> 24:39.531
for thousands and thousands of years.

24:39.614 --> 24:41.032
Yes.

24:41.324 --> 24:44.035
Naturally, you have taken
security precautions.

24:45.036 --> 24:48.122
- I noticed the guard outside.
- Only during the day.

24:48.331 --> 24:50.834
At night when it's locked up,
we use an alarm system.

24:52.794 --> 24:55.088
Sonic detector?

24:55.839 --> 24:57.757
Yeah. That's exactly what it is.

24:57.841 --> 24:59.217
Yes.

25:01.845 --> 25:04.013
You can't take any chances, can you?

25:04.305 --> 25:07.933
No, sir. Not with the Apollo moon rocks.

25:08.016 --> 25:10.769
No. Not with the Apollo moon rocks.

25:14.690 --> 25:16.775
You clever devil, you.

25:22.614 --> 25:24.366
Sylvester, good news.

25:24.825 --> 25:27.494
Orders from the front office.
I will be at the convention.

25:27.578 --> 25:29.454
Fantastic!

25:30.205 --> 25:33.584
Excuse me.
Diana, this is the Black Avenger.

25:33.834 --> 25:37.463
Black Avenger, Diana Prince.
She's a real-life hero.

25:37.546 --> 25:40.716
She works for the government.

25:42.718 --> 25:45.053
I trust he wasn't about to say the IRS.

25:45.929 --> 25:48.515
No. You can relax.
What time should I be here?

25:48.599 --> 25:50.434
- The fun starts at 8:00.
- Good.

25:50.517 --> 25:52.352
It was nice to meet you, Black Avenger.

25:52.436 --> 25:55.563
And I hope you feel better
after being inside there.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.357
I'll see you later, okay? Bye, Sylvester.

25:58.441 --> 25:59.525
Sly.

26:02.778 --> 26:05.406
She's going with me
to the masquerade contest.

26:06.491 --> 26:07.783
We have a date.

26:19.504 --> 26:22.089
- Excuse me. Ms. Prince?
- Yes.

26:22.173 --> 26:25.301
The name is Chan,
with the IADC office out here.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.261
I have some information for you.

26:27.345 --> 26:31.140
- A photograph from Washington, I hope?
- Right. The photo.

26:31.516 --> 26:33.893
But I can't give it to you in here.

26:33.976 --> 26:35.895
- Let's go outside.
- Yeah.

26:42.360 --> 26:45.904
- When did it arrive?
- The photo? Just now.

26:46.196 --> 26:49.491
- Where did you get it?
- We took it off our central computer.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.409
- Come on.
- Is that right?

26:54.996 --> 26:56.248
Okay.

26:56.331 --> 26:57.833
Enough is enough.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.627
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

27:00.794 --> 27:03.088
What's with the hammerlock on the arm?

27:04.131 --> 27:05.757
You like this better?

27:31.448 --> 27:32.950
Here. Grab the line!

27:43.085 --> 27:45.963
You might say that I've reached
the end of my rope...

27:46.046 --> 27:48.090
and I want you to answer a few questions.

27:48.174 --> 27:50.634
And then,
depending on what you tell me...

27:51.302 --> 27:55.055
you might have to forget
all about the fun we've had here today.

27:55.139 --> 27:56.307
Okay?

28:10.362 --> 28:11.530
Check us in.

28:23.958 --> 28:25.919
Mr. Rohan, you're early.

28:32.842 --> 28:35.053
Where on earth have you been?

28:35.470 --> 28:37.514
Swimming.

28:58.284 --> 29:00.912
- We're almost ready.
- Good. I'll be backstage.

29:42.870 --> 29:46.707
A little white sound
ought to keep that sonic detector busy.

30:08.227 --> 30:11.814
Look, kid, why don't you go play
in the freeway or something, huh?

30:14.275 --> 30:16.402
Please, kid, go away, huh?

30:17.403 --> 30:19.822
You want my autograph?

30:19.906 --> 30:21.240
No.

30:22.784 --> 30:25.036
You're missing the masquerade.

30:27.622 --> 30:29.874
You don't care.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.418
Here. I have an idea. How about this?

31:27.597 --> 31:29.599
Look, kid-

31:29.850 --> 31:32.393
Perhaps, you should make that kids.

31:34.645 --> 31:36.438
A lesson from you, Kimball.

31:36.605 --> 31:40.651
In order to appear inconspicuous here,
one must be conspicuous.

31:41.152 --> 31:43.821
Now, where are the crystals? In the case?

31:46.824 --> 31:47.908
The pedestal.

31:47.992 --> 31:49.076
What is this, Rohan?

31:49.160 --> 31:51.579
I had every intention
of coming through for you.

31:51.662 --> 31:53.706
You botched your assignment, Kimball.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.958
Things here have become unduly messy.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.752
And you, I'm afraid,
have become a loose end.

31:59.003 --> 32:00.337
You're going to kill me?

32:00.421 --> 32:04.300
I'll do what I must in order to tidy up.

32:04.925 --> 32:07.553
But first, the crystals.

32:13.476 --> 32:15.436
They're not here, Mr. Kimball.

32:54.224 --> 32:55.308
Thank you.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.394
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

33:05.068 --> 33:08.737
Will Whoever swiped the spaceboot
from the spacesuit exhibit...

33:08.821 --> 33:10.197
please return it.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.117
Okay.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.869
Now for the moment
you've all been waiting for.

33:19.581 --> 33:24.461
Your host for tonight's masquerade,
Mr. Robby the Robot!

33:42.813 --> 33:43.897
Thank you.

33:44.398 --> 33:48.318
Welcome to the second annual
Space Questicon.

33:48.402 --> 33:52.156
This was truly a golden year
of science fiction.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.158
And if the tomorrows we've seen
on the silver screen...

33:55.241 --> 33:57.160
for the past year weren't enough...

33:57.243 --> 34:00.788
soon Space Quest will return
to our television screens...

34:00.872 --> 34:03.708
thanks to the efforts of many of you,
I'm sure.

34:05.793 --> 34:08.379
At this, give yourselves a hand.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.052
- Hi, Diana.
- Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.598
- Where have you been?
- I had a little business to take care of.

34:26.647 --> 34:29.108
Where are the crystals, Mr. Kimball?

34:29.192 --> 34:30.943
I have no idea.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.279
And why on earth would I tell you if I did?

34:33.362 --> 34:36.114
'Cause there's a chance,
no matter how slight...

34:36.491 --> 34:38.826
that you might get out of this alive.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.661
Our next contestant is Susie.

34:41.745 --> 34:44.998
Modeling a fashion
from the planet Gothos.

34:45.081 --> 34:46.123
Susie.

34:46.208 --> 34:49.002
Source: her own imagination.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.512
That's some imagination.

35:04.476 --> 35:06.770
That'll really turn your head around.

35:09.981 --> 35:12.400
This isn't just a corporate panty raid.

35:12.609 --> 35:14.111
It's the big league.

35:14.319 --> 35:16.988
Big people and big money are involved.

35:17.739 --> 35:21.243
We're in the ninth inning,
and I play for keeps.

35:22.410 --> 35:25.580
I put the crystals in the pedestal
at the Torrence plant.

35:25.664 --> 35:28.333
They should have been delivered
in the pedestal.

35:28.416 --> 35:30.543
That means whoever received
the shipment here...

35:30.626 --> 35:32.002
has the crystals.

35:32.461 --> 35:33.921
Right, Mr. Kimball?

35:39.051 --> 35:41.053
Grogan.

35:41.804 --> 35:44.473
The kid's name is Sylvester Grogan.

35:46.976 --> 35:49.812
Our next contestants
are from the Planet of Apes...

35:49.895 --> 35:52.440
doing their version ofDisco Kong.

36:19.257 --> 36:20.341
And here we ha ve a...

36:20.425 --> 36:22.677
That's him in the blue suit.

36:22.760 --> 36:23.928
Mr. Avenger!

36:26.389 --> 36:29.893
I would still like clarification
of your comments this afternoon.

36:30.935 --> 36:32.645
Certainly, my good man.

36:32.729 --> 36:35.315
Certainly. I don't blame you at all.

36:35.648 --> 36:39.402
My favorite episode is the one
where the guy with three eyes...

36:39.486 --> 36:41.404
falls into the fifth dimension.

36:41.988 --> 36:44.824
- You mean, three noses.
- Right. Whatever.

36:44.908 --> 36:49.120
Source: from the movie Meteor Mutants.

36:58.171 --> 37:01.049
And now we have little Ricky Bedard.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.469
Source: his favorite TV show.

37:12.518 --> 37:13.769
Isn't he darling?

37:13.852 --> 37:15.521
Come on. Give him a big hand.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.357
Sylvester?

37:22.236 --> 37:23.946
Kimball got away.

37:24.029 --> 37:25.114
No matter.

37:25.405 --> 37:27.991
It won't take long, will it, Mr. Grogan?

37:30.285 --> 37:31.912
I have no idea.

37:33.247 --> 37:36.917
And our next contestant is another visitor
from another galaxy.

37:37.251 --> 37:40.879
Planet ofHeat: the Lava Man.

37:47.094 --> 37:48.178
Wait a minute.

37:48.262 --> 37:51.807
None of the things you've been telling me
check with the known facts, sir.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.350
Is that right?

37:55.768 --> 37:56.811
Excuse me.

37:56.894 --> 37:59.772
Does anybody know the name
of his tailor?

38:01.107 --> 38:04.026
Are you guys
from the Torrence observatory or what?

38:04.152 --> 38:05.987
Just answer my question.

38:07.113 --> 38:09.824
I don't know anything about any crystals!

38:13.953 --> 38:17.623
My dad is very high up
in space research, you know?

38:17.915 --> 38:19.709
And I have a gun.

38:20.293 --> 38:22.086
That makes us pretty even, doesn't it?

38:22.170 --> 38:26.382
Now, Mr. Grogan, where are the crystals
that were in that pedestal?

38:26.466 --> 38:29.510
There was nothing in the pedestal!
Except...

38:30.845 --> 38:32.138
Wait a minute.

38:32.847 --> 38:36.476
In the storage crate,
loose in the filling, were...

38:38.978 --> 38:42.939
Look, I just thought
they were chunks of plastic or something.

38:43.607 --> 38:45.734
Where are they now, Mr. Grogan?

38:48.612 --> 38:50.363
I gave them to Janet.

38:50.447 --> 38:53.533
She said she wanted them.
I have no idea why.

38:58.288 --> 39:00.332
As for our next contestant...

39:00.499 --> 39:02.751
anyone for a little Venusian tennis?

39:11.134 --> 39:13.178
I've been trying to find you.

39:15.847 --> 39:18.433
I was looking for Sylvester Grogan.
Have you seen him?

39:18.517 --> 39:21.061
They've got him
and they're probably going to kill him.

39:21.144 --> 39:22.604
What?

39:23.355 --> 39:24.856
Diana?

39:28.443 --> 39:29.777
Kimball?

39:30.903 --> 39:33.572
Look, murder is not my style.

39:33.656 --> 39:36.492
We've got to stop them.
But we're gonna need some help.

39:36.575 --> 39:39.537
- I think I know where I can get some.
- Wait.

39:44.375 --> 39:47.753
Now we have two very strange characters.

39:47.837 --> 39:50.923
Mate Ferguson and Captain Mitchell.

39:57.721 --> 40:00.099
There's no business like show business.

40:07.189 --> 40:11.026
Next we have two young maids
who are not long for this world...

40:11.485 --> 40:15.698
for they are two Runners
obviously pursued by a Sandman.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.226
Kimball.

40:45.310 --> 40:47.937
I just spoke to Diana Prince.
Let's go get Sylvester.

40:48.021 --> 40:49.063
Wait.

40:49.147 --> 40:52.066
Rohan's men are down there.
Looks like they're after something.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.068
And now for the final moment.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.613
The winner of the costume contest.

40:59.449 --> 41:04.078
I'm proud to announce
the winner is Lothar the Barbarian!

41:13.587 --> 41:18.050
I want to thank you all.
Thank you all. I deserved it. I really did.

41:21.470 --> 41:22.721
The crystals!

41:23.138 --> 41:24.765
They're on the scepter!

41:26.100 --> 41:28.519
Thank you, one and all.

41:29.103 --> 41:32.272
Next year, I'll win the same thing,
so don't even bother to show up.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.659
This isn't in the program.

41:45.119 --> 41:48.747
- Shall we?
- Ladies first.

42:00.299 --> 42:02.802
Come on, Janet,
we can't miss a run like this.

42:02.885 --> 42:05.388
No, Brad. I can't leave.
I'm running this whole thing.

42:05.471 --> 42:07.598
I don't even know what's going on.

42:22.155 --> 42:23.448
Okay.

42:24.282 --> 42:26.200
Please, don't!

42:26.284 --> 42:28.119
Then start running, Runner.

42:39.755 --> 42:42.466
I'm sorry you're missing the party,
Mr. Grogan.

42:43.383 --> 42:45.677
That's quite all right.

42:45.761 --> 42:48.930
In fact, I've had more than enough
excitement in one day.

42:52.768 --> 42:54.269
Grogan!

42:54.352 --> 42:57.647
When I get you, Grogan!

42:58.356 --> 43:00.484
Grogan!

43:03.528 --> 43:05.238
Let me out!

43:58.040 --> 44:00.042
Are you all right?

44:01.335 --> 44:04.797
Wonder Woman, where's Diana?
I've locked someone in the exhibit.

44:05.422 --> 44:08.551
There they are. Those are the crystals.
That's what they're after.

44:08.634 --> 44:11.095
Yes. And so is Diana Prince and so is...

44:26.860 --> 44:29.028
You see, once that foreign power...

44:29.112 --> 44:31.239
had bought the collimating crystals
from Rohan...

44:31.364 --> 44:34.659
they could've equipped an entire army
with laser weapons.

44:35.118 --> 44:38.037
And I thought they were
just chunks of plastic.

44:43.585 --> 44:46.129
You really gave him the works.

44:55.263 --> 44:56.347
You know what?

44:56.431 --> 44:59.893
A lot of people are looking that way
when they come out of my exhibit.

44:59.976 --> 45:02.562
Sly, those spinning lights and that floor...

45:02.937 --> 45:05.522
- It doesn't bother you at all?
- Should it?

45:11.278 --> 45:14.031
The Black Avenger. The real one.

45:16.450 --> 45:18.035
Poor guy.

45:18.535 --> 45:21.205
He must've found a spare costume.

45:21.580 --> 45:24.333
I wonder how Kimball
could've gotten away so fast?

45:24.416 --> 45:27.711
The police got here within minutes
when that riot broke out.

45:27.795 --> 45:31.215
Kimball is the expert at that sort of thing.
Excuse me.

45:38.388 --> 45:39.473
Mr. Robot!

45:40.974 --> 45:44.645
What did you think of last year's
The Amazing Planet Martos?

45:44.728 --> 45:48.107
- Sorry. Must've missed that one.
- Missed it?

45:48.190 --> 45:49.608
You starred in it.

45:50.734 --> 45:53.152
Yeah, right. Terrific movie.

45:53.236 --> 45:55.655
It wasn't a movie. It was a TV show.

45:55.863 --> 45:57.490
I think you're a fake.

45:57.573 --> 46:00.409
Okay, kid. Okay. You're right. I am a fake.

46:00.993 --> 46:03.579
Now, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

46:10.002 --> 46:14.340
The guy who's supposed to be in this suit,
you know, the real Robby the Robot?

46:14.424 --> 46:16.843
- He's a lush.
- No.

46:16.926 --> 46:19.554
Just take a look
behind those curtains over there.

46:19.637 --> 46:21.639
He's passed out. Dead to the world.

46:21.722 --> 46:24.434
Like somebody conked him
over the head or something.

46:24.517 --> 46:25.977
Go on. Take a look.

46:30.314 --> 46:32.984
I just wish you could stay around, Diana.

46:33.067 --> 46:36.195
You probably got the wrong idea
about these conventions.

46:36.863 --> 46:37.989
Not at all.

46:38.114 --> 46:40.949
I always wondered what you did
with your weekends.

46:42.701 --> 46:46.288
No. It's been a real learning experience,
Sylvester. Sly.

46:46.872 --> 46:48.290
That's better.

46:48.373 --> 46:51.001
Robby the Robot's a lush.

46:52.085 --> 46:55.547
It's true. He really is. He's a lush.

46:59.426 --> 47:00.594
Oh, no.

47:01.553 --> 47:03.013
What is it, Diana?

47:03.555 --> 47:07.369
Excuse me, Sylvester.
But I've got a robot to catch.

47:41.195 --> 47:42.134
