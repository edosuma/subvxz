04:09.510 --> 04:10.989
Can I have a beer, please?

04:16.386 --> 04:18.475
Okay. Uh... Cerveza.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.480
Grande. Por favor.
Big one.

04:33.882 --> 04:34.883
Cerveza.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.320
Grande.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.589
Oh, yeah.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.170
One more.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.999
No hablo inglés, gringo.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.263
Uno mas.

05:10.527 --> 05:14.183
And I'’m not a gringo.
Gringos are American.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.141
No inglés.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.665
No, I don'’t speak Spanish.

05:19.928 --> 05:23.279
I don'’t know
what you'’re saying, mate.

05:40.514 --> 05:43.299
No, thanks. I don'’t--
I don'’t-- I don'’t drink.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.866
Esto está en el casa.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.999
I don'’t drink.
No, thank you.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.349
Tequila.I know what it is.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.481
I just... No. Gracias.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.265
Irrespetuoso.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.143
You know what?
Fuck it.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.059
Why not?
I'’m already dead anyway.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.190
Uno tequila.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.627
OÓrale!

06:06.801 --> 06:08.368
Oh, that you understand.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.938
Salud.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.200
Cheers, big ears.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.640
Whoo!

06:33.393 --> 06:34.394
Hello.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.702
I don'’t usually
get calls here.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
I knew something was off.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.359
Yes. Very thin...

06:43.533 --> 06:45.274
He is blonde with blue eyes.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.711
He seems half dead?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.846
They usually stop here
on the way to the Grim Reaper.

06:53.848 --> 06:54.718
Yes...

06:54.892 --> 06:56.546
Boss.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.418
Whatever you say.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.300
All right, uh...

07:59.566 --> 08:01.959
Hola.Come on. Keep going.

You touch this guy
one more time--

09:03.325 --> 09:05.545
and you'’re gonna
get to know ME.
Understand?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.635
But your mom ordered us
to kill him.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.288
She just called.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.508
I don'’t think you understand,
my son.

09:13.465 --> 09:16.991
Do you see my mom here?
No, right?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.602
So I'’m the one making orders
around here, bitch.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.778
Put your FUCKING gun away--

09:21.952 --> 09:23.998
and nobody needs to get hurt.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.477

a gun pointed to his head.

That'’s what I do.
I prevent trouble.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.442

Not drunk enough, and they take

their big, green, beautiful
dollars down the street.

This is about you.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.883

19:59.546 --> 20:01.417
You'’re so hard-core, bitch.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.072
It'’s my bar, bitch.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.253
One for you.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.386

20:16.171 --> 20:18.608
There he is.
Cabrón.Ah!

20:29.967 --> 20:31.230
His head. His head.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.147
Uy, uy, uy.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.543

20:48.247 --> 20:52.076
Not-- Not if I see you.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.296
Not if I see you what?Mm-hmm.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.907
First. Not if I see...

20:57.081 --> 20:58.387
It'’s like--
you know what--

20:58.561 --> 21:00.259
Never mind.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.738
Good night, papi.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.183
Oh look, he'’s drooling.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.709
Gross.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.493
Poor baby.

21:18.886 --> 21:21.018
Good night, friend.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
Look at this place--

21:27.460 --> 21:28.939
Gross. It smells disgusting.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.071
So embarrassing.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.681
Let'’s go. Let'’s go.

21:45.042 --> 21:49.003
You sound
sort of funny for a gringo.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.527
That'’s because
I'’m not a gringo.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.573
I told you that already,
Mom.

21:53.747 --> 21:56.663
Oh, that'’s right.
I forgot.

21:56.837 --> 22:00.580
You traveled a very far way
to Mexico. Why? Why Mexico?

22:01.537 --> 22:03.409
I-- Yeah.
I know why Mexico.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.454
But why stay here,
besides my daughter?

22:07.195 --> 22:10.198
I feel like America
would suit you better.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.549
The land of hopes and dreams.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.638
That'’s why you came there
in the first place, no?

22:15.812 --> 22:18.293
That'’s where everybody goes
when they'’re running
from something.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.686
And you?

22:21.644 --> 22:24.473
You seem like the type of gringo
that'’s always running
from something.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.041
I don'’t know what, though.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.260
Again, not a gringo.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.002
That'’s not really the point,
blanco.

22:32.176 --> 22:36.180
You left Australia because
you were running away.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.660
Broken family?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.836
Maybe, but no,
that'’s not it.

22:40.794 --> 22:45.233
Mmm. Oh.

22:45.407 --> 22:49.368
To find yourself, or maybe
to run away from yourself.

22:50.978 --> 22:54.634
Ay, but wherever you go,
there you are.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.202
That'’s a bit cliché.Mm-hmm.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.075
Donde quiera que vaya,
ahí estás.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.817
It sounds better
in Spanish, verdad?

23:03.991 --> 23:05.558
Everything sounds better
in Spanish.

23:05.732 --> 23:10.911
Mmm. You moved to America
to find the American dream.

23:11.999 --> 23:15.306
And yet, you end up
working as a drug mule

23:15.481 --> 23:17.221
for a Mexican drug cartel.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.050
And poof, there you are,

23:20.224 --> 23:24.359
standing in front
of yourself again.

23:24.533 --> 23:25.665
But...

23:27.580 --> 23:30.191
you literally dodged
my bullets.

23:30.365 --> 23:33.716
And any man
who can survive my bullets...

23:35.849 --> 23:37.981
can take care of my daughter.

23:38.155 --> 23:41.550
Well, with all due respect,
your daughter takes care of me.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.640
Oh.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.815
That'’s sweet. Sí.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.251
Ay, ya.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.387
That being said,

23:52.561 --> 23:56.043
any of your kangaroo bullshit
comes back to bite you

23:56.217 --> 23:57.827
and my daughter is involved...

23:59.133 --> 24:01.657
well, I think we both know
how that one ends. Yeah?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.717
All right.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.240
Just let me be.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.025
Yeah.
All right. Stop. Stop.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.897
Do you give up?Yes, I give up. I give up.

26:01.516 --> 26:04.214
Hey, Marco.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.783
Good to see you too, man.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.873
You good?I'’m good. You good?

26:11.047 --> 26:12.527
Yeah.All right.

26:29.892 --> 26:32.721
Hair of the dog, huh?Ah. It'’s the only cure, mate.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.114
Mmm.The only cure.

26:35.332 --> 26:36.377
Cheers.

26:41.687 --> 26:47.606
So, last time I saw you,
you were hired to kill me.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.869
No.Yeah.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.522
You were hired to kill me.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.482
Oh, yeah.
I knew it was something.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.310
Ah, it was something.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.272
You'’ve looked better.

27:02.446 --> 27:05.232
Javi calls it...
homeless chic.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.498
Wasting away again
in Margaritaville.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.413
I'’m not wasting
anything, pal.Mmm.

27:13.936 --> 27:16.025
I finally found a place
I feel like I can be happy in.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.375
Oh... yeah.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.986
Yeah.Yeah.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.901
Reminds me
of something I lost.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.341
It'’s my way of staying close.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.912
So how'’d you find me, Marco?

27:39.353 --> 27:40.746
There'’s a storm coming.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.227
Okay, Batman.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.490
I'’ve known where you are
for a minute.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.233
Problem is,
now everyone knows.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.453
'’Cause you got a big mouth.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.455
That'’s not my style, brother.
You know me. Mm-mmm.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.674
Yeah, I know you.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.636
She'’s alive.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.251
What?Valentina.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.514
Don'’t do that.Valentina is alive.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.342
Marco.She'’s alive.
I'’ve seen her.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.954
Marco, you'’re
fucking with me.Come here.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.696
No. How? How?

28:18.958 --> 28:20.133
You left too early.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.444
I'’ve seen her.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.577
Her-- Her mother is keeping
her on the compound

28:29.751 --> 28:32.972
like a fucking damsel
surrounded by a dragon.

28:34.451 --> 28:35.626
I'’m gonna take you to her.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.237
You back
working for Victoria?

28:38.412 --> 28:39.979
Bitch wants me
just as dead as you.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.070
Well, maybe not
as much as you.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.288
And I have friends.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.378
Had friends.

28:48.552 --> 28:50.032
You said you'’ve seen her.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.411
Okay. What'’s in it for you?

29:22.369 --> 29:25.285
My honor. My loyalty.
My respect.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.329
And?

29:27.722 --> 29:28.723
Seventy-five grand.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.464
There he is.Here I am.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.858
Now, do I look like
I have 75 grand?

29:33.032 --> 29:34.337
No.No?

29:34.511 --> 29:35.643
No, you don'’t.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.299
But you do.

29:39.473 --> 29:42.389
You stole from Victoria
and got away.

29:42.563 --> 29:45.261
How could you spend
that kind of money down here
without getting noticed?

29:45.435 --> 29:47.568
Times are tough, brother.

29:47.742 --> 29:50.005
As soon as
Romeo finds his Julieta,

29:50.179 --> 29:51.746
I'’m getting out of Dodge.

29:53.008 --> 29:55.619
And we'’re square. Deal?

30:00.494 --> 30:01.930
I hope you'’re ready to dig.

30:03.410 --> 30:04.498
What?

30:15.117 --> 30:16.858
That'’s five gold teeth.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.209
Learn to use dental floss.

30:20.383 --> 30:24.213
Please.
I don'’t understand
what you'’re saying.

30:24.387 --> 30:27.869
I said you have
too many cavities, gringo.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.828
Consider this a free
dental appointment.

30:30.002 --> 30:33.875
Hey, isn'’t this
sort of how we met?

30:34.049 --> 30:36.008
Your fate'’s looking more grim.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.925
This guy isn'’t
much of a fighter, sweetie.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.232
I don'’t think
this one will escape.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.278
And he definitely won'’t

30:45.452 --> 30:47.889
fall in love with
a beautiful Mexican girl.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.586
There'’s nobody like

30:49.760 --> 30:51.675
The Thunder from Down Under
right, sweetie?

30:52.546 --> 30:54.069
You'’re a hopeless romantic, son.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.984
But remember

30:56.158 --> 30:58.117
that you could have been

30:59.509 --> 31:01.468
this poor bastard.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.949
Please.
I would be a lot less scared
if you speak in English.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.254
Please, please.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.082
You should be scared.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.563
You'’re at the very end

31:09.737 --> 31:11.957
of the longest,
worst walk of your life.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.916
Please. Ple--

31:15.090 --> 31:17.049
Come along, lovers.

31:18.789 --> 31:20.487
You'’re just
gonna leave me here?

31:21.662 --> 31:25.318
Walk until
you can no longer walk.

31:25.492 --> 31:26.667
Please!

31:28.234 --> 31:30.976
Please, no. No! No! No!

31:34.675 --> 31:37.460
No, no, no, no.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.854
Please! No, no, no.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.378
No! No, no, no, no.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.467
No!

31:44.641 --> 31:46.252
♪ You let my fee--♪

32:18.632 --> 32:19.850
You read Spanish?

32:20.634 --> 32:21.896
Let me try.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.899
Saciar La Sed.

32:26.596 --> 32:27.771
Do you understand it?

32:28.642 --> 32:29.773
No.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.605
So the next time
I take her out,

32:35.779 --> 32:38.347
we'’re starting to
get more comfortable
with each other.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.654
I decide I want to take
her to a horror movie.

32:40.828 --> 32:43.265
Start breaking down
some physical walls.
You know what I mean.

32:43.439 --> 32:47.574
If there'’s a spooky part,
she reaches over,
grabs my arm,

32:47.748 --> 32:49.271
rests her head
on my shoulder.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.143
By scare three or four,
that armrest is up,

32:51.317 --> 32:53.188
my arm is over her shoulder.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.017
You know what happens next.

32:56.191 --> 32:59.151
But she tells me
she doesn'’t do horror movies.

32:59.325 --> 33:03.372
Or, like, she hasn'’t
since she peed her pants
when she was a kid.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.505
She doesn'’t like '’em.
Perfect.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.768
I can be the hero.

33:07.942 --> 33:11.163
"Don'’t worry.
You'’re safe with me.
I got you, babe."

33:12.164 --> 33:14.601
Sonny and Cher.

33:14.775 --> 33:19.432
Ugh. She likes me.
She feels comfortable
with me. She trusts me.

33:19.606 --> 33:22.565
So we go.
The joke'’s on me.

33:22.739 --> 33:26.091
By the first scare,
she digs her nails into
my arm so badly I bleed.

33:26.265 --> 33:29.050
Scare two,
she bit my shoulder
with her mouth.

33:30.399 --> 33:33.837
Last scare, my arm is
finally around her shoulder.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.797
She gets
so fucking freaked out,
back of her head bops up

33:36.971 --> 33:38.320
and hits me right in the jaw.

33:38.494 --> 33:39.713
My tooth is still loose.

33:41.758 --> 33:42.890
What'’s funny?

33:44.239 --> 33:46.067
I think
the girl'’s an easy mark.

33:46.633 --> 33:47.634
What do you mean?

33:49.157 --> 33:51.464
Like putting spiders
in her bed

33:51.638 --> 33:55.076
or putting limbs in places
like her drawers or something.

33:55.250 --> 33:59.428
Leave her cryptic texts
that say,
"Are your doors unlocked?"

33:59.602 --> 34:01.952
And then don'’t respond
for, like, days.

34:02.127 --> 34:05.608
She'’ll be so scared
that she'’ll fall
right into your arms.

34:06.435 --> 34:08.350
The hero, just amplified.

34:09.395 --> 34:11.092
Why didn'’t I think of that?

34:11.266 --> 34:14.052
Bienvenidos,gringos.
What can I get for you?

34:15.575 --> 34:17.881
Dos cervezas, por favor.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.101
See that?
Even in your native tongue.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.624
Two beers. You got it.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.061
And keep it open.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.280
Oh, man.
We don'’t really do that.

34:25.454 --> 34:29.676
Oh. I'’m really thirsty.

34:32.331 --> 34:35.508
Open. You got it.
No problem.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.732
Sis. Qué pasó, mija?

34:42.906 --> 34:45.039
You know your rule,
"If you see something,
say something"?

34:45.213 --> 34:46.519
Uh-huh.

34:46.693 --> 34:47.781
See something.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.132
Like ghosts?

34:51.698 --> 34:52.829
No.

34:57.834 --> 34:58.835
Those gringitos?

35:00.315 --> 35:01.664
What are you doing?

35:01.838 --> 35:03.275
Click, click. Bang, bang.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.103
They got guns, bitch.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.756
Why are you telling me?
We have security.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.802
Yes, I know that.
But he'’s not here.

35:14.764 --> 35:17.593
Yeah,
just a little bit deeper.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.640
Little more.Nice.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.515
Hello?Hi. You busy?

35:26.689 --> 35:29.127
No. I can talk. What'’s up?

35:29.301 --> 35:30.215
Can you come in early?

35:30.389 --> 35:32.913
No, I'’m... busy.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.349
Fuck do you do?

35:34.523 --> 35:36.917
You need something, Javi?It'’s just...

35:37.091 --> 35:39.659
you'’re so good at your job
as a security guy.

35:39.833 --> 35:44.359
You'’re the best security guy.
I only feel safe
when you'’re here.

35:44.533 --> 35:45.795
Javi, what'’s going on?

35:45.969 --> 35:49.190
Okay. Don'’t panic,
but two guys.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.453
Both armed with guns.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.500
At the bar?Yeah.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.937
Are they robbing it?No, they just opened a tab.

35:57.111 --> 35:58.634
Do we do that?

35:58.808 --> 36:00.158
No, but when I saw
la pistola,

36:00.332 --> 36:02.508
I stopped paying attention.

36:02.682 --> 36:05.685
Okay, Javi.
I need you to listen to me
very carefully. Okay?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.295
Are you parked out back?Always.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.384
Are you with Jackie? Claro, papi.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.821
The two of you
need to go out
and get in the car.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.954
The limo.The limo.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.957
Go out and get in the limo
and come and get me. Okay?

36:17.131 --> 36:18.872
Well, who'’s gonna
watch the bar?Now, Javi!

36:19.046 --> 36:20.613
Are we in trouble? I'’ll explain later.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.398
Just get here.
Don'’t draw too much attention.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.574
"Don'’t draw
too much attention."

36:28.751 --> 36:30.057
Let me get that.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.668
What the-- Hey!

36:32.842 --> 36:34.540
We gotta go.Why do we have to go?

36:35.976 --> 36:38.108
I'’m going. I'’m going.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.421
Hey, what are you doing?

36:46.595 --> 36:48.118
I'’m digging.Why?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.295
For the money.It'’s right here.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.166
Yeah, it was in the closet.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.778
Why the fuck
am I digging then?

36:55.952 --> 36:57.563
Because it'’s fun
to watch you sweat, Marco.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.434
What an asshole!No time to argue.
We gotta go.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.871
"No time to argue."We gotta go now.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.525
Digging holes
that we don'’t need.

37:06.789 --> 37:08.574
What is this?

37:51.878 --> 37:53.096
I think
we'’ve been stood up.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.838
Yeah, because
no one likes you.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.518
They'’re dust.Yeah. I see that,
you stupid fuck.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.303
What did I do?You let them get away.

38:25.477 --> 38:26.826
You left
the fucking tab open.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.088
What does that have to do
with anything?

38:28.262 --> 38:29.872
Get in the fucking car,
Duncan.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.312
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:46.411 --> 38:48.151
Someone want to tell me
what'’s going on?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.371
Hi, I'’m Marco.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.678
Hi, I'’m Jackie.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.985
Nice grip.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.465
Now, can someone
please tell me

38:57.639 --> 38:59.467
what the fuck is going on?

38:59.641 --> 39:00.816
Those guys at the bar.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.515
With guns.They'’re looking for me.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.865
And anyone around me isn'’t safe
until I figure this out.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.214
Figure what out?

39:07.388 --> 39:08.911
The less you know,
the better.

39:09.085 --> 39:10.565
This is starting to sound like

39:10.739 --> 39:12.480
some real dark
underworld-type shit, papi.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.747
Wait a second. Is this
some real dark underworld--

39:19.879 --> 39:21.837
Am I gonna die?
Am I the driver?

39:22.011 --> 39:23.665
Javi--Wait, wait. Those guys.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.537
The gingers.The what?

39:25.711 --> 39:27.582
The white boys at my bar
that Javi said had guns.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.192
Wait a sec.
They were gringos?

39:29.367 --> 39:30.890
Not tough-looking ones either.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.327
Javi, you know
what gringos are, right?

39:33.501 --> 39:35.198
Papi,white boys
from America.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.375
And that'’s what they were?Freckles and everything.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.942
What the fuck is going on,
Marco?

39:40.116 --> 39:42.075
I don'’t know.
Maybe the old lady
wants to diversify.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.603
We need to make a stop.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.589
Hello.Hello.

40:17.763 --> 40:18.720
Fill it up please.

40:18.894 --> 40:19.982
Sure.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.439
Anything else, gringo?Yeah.

41:25.613 --> 41:28.050
You can take your hand
off that shotgun

41:29.138 --> 41:31.271
and give me a thousand pesos'’
worth of gas.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.187
Oh, and a pack of Durry'’s.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.368
On the house.

41:44.066 --> 41:45.285
Cabrón!

41:45.459 --> 41:46.634
Sorry, Tío.Again?

41:47.940 --> 41:49.768
Mop that shit up.

41:49.942 --> 41:52.205
Before I come at you like
a candle burning on both ends.

41:53.685 --> 41:54.642
Miguel!

41:55.295 --> 41:56.339
Yeah, Tío.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.559
Take the gas cans with you.

41:58.733 --> 41:59.908
I'’m sorry, Tío.

42:06.306 --> 42:08.526
Useless.

42:09.570 --> 42:11.093
Sorry about the shotgun.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.226
I don'’t remember
if we were cool or not.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.575
You never know with us.

42:14.749 --> 42:16.055
I think three years
is long enough.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.839
I heard you were dead.Hmm.

42:18.013 --> 42:19.928
But then I heard you weren'’t,
but you could be.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.365
I'’m glad you'’re still kicking,
mano.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.065
Yeah, you know me.
I kick until my legs don'’t work.

42:26.239 --> 42:29.416
Then I realized with you
and you-know-who'’s history--

42:29.590 --> 42:30.504
I'’ve been away.

42:30.678 --> 42:32.506
And now?I'’m back.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.160
You know what happens to me
if I help you?

42:34.334 --> 42:36.118
I do.

42:36.292 --> 42:39.426
I'’m done with all that.
I'’m clean. I run a business.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.428
I have a family. I'’m happy.

42:41.602 --> 42:42.995
I know the feeling.

42:44.387 --> 42:47.042
But then,
I wouldn'’t even be here
if it weren'’t for you.

42:51.612 --> 42:52.613
I'’m gonna help you.

42:54.397 --> 42:56.965
But the minute your taillights
are out of my sight...

42:58.967 --> 43:02.014
I'’m gonna give you 30 minutes
before I call it in.

43:04.494 --> 43:06.192
Valentina'’s alive, Ramon.

43:12.546 --> 43:13.852
Follow me.

43:29.302 --> 43:33.262
It'’s safer for you
if you learn
how to speak Spanish.

43:33.436 --> 43:35.221
I already know
how to speak Spanish.

43:35.395 --> 43:37.876
Mmm.
No, I don'’t think so. No.I do.

43:41.793 --> 43:43.185
Saturday...

43:44.883 --> 43:45.927
Nine--

43:46.101 --> 43:47.581
That'’s a number.

43:47.755 --> 43:49.104
What?

43:51.193 --> 43:52.891
Uh...

43:55.110 --> 43:56.459
That'’s a bad word.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.680
You say it all the time.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.160
I know, but...

44:03.075 --> 44:04.424
Try again.Okay.

44:05.425 --> 44:07.122
Where... this...

44:07.819 --> 44:09.081
the library?

44:09.255 --> 44:11.039
Stop it.
No, no, no, no, no.

44:11.213 --> 44:13.476
Stop it. You'’re like--
Say it with me.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.739
Okay.Repeat with me.

44:14.913 --> 44:16.262
Okay. Go.

44:16.436 --> 44:18.786
Valentina...Valentina...

44:18.960 --> 44:20.005
I love you.

44:21.397 --> 44:22.703
I love you.

44:22.877 --> 44:24.270
See?

44:25.575 --> 44:27.012
That sounds good.

44:29.797 --> 44:31.494
I have a secret.

44:32.408 --> 44:33.932
You have a secret?Mmm.

44:35.063 --> 44:36.674
Which is...

44:36.848 --> 44:38.850
I'’m halfway
through Rosetta Stone.

44:39.807 --> 44:41.243
Who is Rosita Stone?

44:41.417 --> 44:42.375
What?Who is she?

44:43.637 --> 44:44.725
Why are you laughing?

44:44.899 --> 44:46.901
Who is she?

44:47.075 --> 44:48.642
It'’s a book.
It'’s a book.

44:48.816 --> 44:51.253
Book.Yeah. I learn Spanish.

44:54.474 --> 44:56.041
Well, I'’m not
that far through it.

44:56.215 --> 44:59.609
I said you just need
to hang out with more Mexicans.

45:01.481 --> 45:02.961
Hmm.

45:03.135 --> 45:05.703
A book.
My love. To speak Spanish?

45:05.877 --> 45:07.617
Seriously?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.403
You'’re such a white boy.
You know that.

45:13.885 --> 45:15.147
But I'’ll teach you.

45:15.321 --> 45:16.409
Yeah?Yeah.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.253
Huh?

45:38.039 --> 45:39.432
Retired, huh?

45:39.606 --> 45:42.740
Insurance policy.
This is everything.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.047
Hasn'’t been touched
in three years.

45:49.050 --> 45:50.269
She better be worth it.

45:51.574 --> 45:52.793
She'’s everything.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.495
Come out
with your hands up!

45:59.669 --> 46:01.019
We have you surrounded!

46:01.193 --> 46:03.325
Don'’t look at me.
I was with you.

46:07.025 --> 46:08.591
Okay,
what the fuck?

46:08.766 --> 46:09.941
Ah, lookee here.

46:11.507 --> 46:12.900
Surrounded?

46:13.074 --> 46:14.554
Yeah, man. Why the fuck
did you say surrounded?

46:14.728 --> 46:16.077
It'’s what
you'’re supposed to say.

46:16.251 --> 46:17.687
What who'’s supposed to say,
the bomb squad?

46:17.862 --> 46:19.907
It doesn'’t fucking matter.Both of you shut up!

46:20.081 --> 46:22.388
Damn Mexican standoff
in my own gas station.

46:22.562 --> 46:24.912
Sir, we don'’t
mean to intrude.

46:25.086 --> 46:27.132
If you'’ll just be a doll
and drop your gun,

46:27.306 --> 46:29.134
we'’ll take these three
and be on our way.

46:29.308 --> 46:32.398
Three?
Why are you taking him?

46:32.572 --> 46:35.357
Marco Antonio Benitez
is wanted in four
different countries.

46:35.531 --> 46:37.359
No, dumbass. Him!

46:37.533 --> 46:40.623
This man'’s now wanted
for helping two fugitives
avoid arrest.

46:41.973 --> 46:44.584
Miguel?
He can'’t even mop
the fucking floor.

46:44.758 --> 46:46.629
Wait, who?Marvin, who the fuck is that?

46:46.804 --> 46:49.023
Who'’s who?The guy you'’re pointing
the fucking gun at.

46:49.197 --> 46:50.242
This is Javi.

46:50.416 --> 46:52.070
That'’s not Javi,
you idiot.

46:52.244 --> 46:53.419
I'’m Miguel.

46:55.203 --> 46:56.422
Hola. Me llamó Javi.

46:56.596 --> 46:57.684
Fuck!

46:57.858 --> 47:00.165
You guys
are really bad at this.

47:00.339 --> 47:02.080
What the fuck
do we do now, man?

47:02.254 --> 47:03.951
I don'’t know.
What are we supposed to do--

47:26.365 --> 47:28.628
We'’re gonna die.
We'’re gonna die.

47:28.802 --> 47:30.021
Everybody okay?
Are you okay?

47:30.195 --> 47:31.413
Yeah.You guys gotta jet.

47:40.466 --> 47:41.771
You guys go!

47:41.946 --> 47:43.556
What about you?Don'’t worry about me.

47:43.730 --> 47:44.862
You'’re no good to her dead.

47:49.170 --> 47:51.042
Cover us. Vámonos, vámonos!

47:55.568 --> 47:56.830
Get in! Get in!

47:57.004 --> 47:59.224
Go, go, go, go!

48:20.419 --> 48:21.986
Tío.It'’s okay.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.770
It'’s okay. It'’s okay.

48:23.944 --> 48:25.076
Protect--

48:25.250 --> 48:26.512
our legacy.

48:38.132 --> 48:39.133
Tío.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.786
Okay. Nuh-uh.
I'’m gonna take a break.
I'’m gonna take a break.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.223
You'’re such a pussy.

49:25.397 --> 49:27.921
How fucking dare you.

49:28.095 --> 49:30.097
This is the guy
everybody'’s talking about?

49:30.271 --> 49:32.186
Fuck you.
This shit is different.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.927
It hurts.
Want me to use a knife?

49:34.101 --> 49:36.625
Just hurry up.Chill, brother.

49:36.799 --> 49:39.063
This shit,
it'’s gonna be on you forever.

49:39.237 --> 49:41.804
You already have tattoos.Yeah, but I was drunk
every time.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.458
You want a beer?

49:43.632 --> 49:44.938
Yes.

49:45.112 --> 49:47.723
Too bad.
I'’m already done, guüey.

49:47.897 --> 49:50.335
It looks pretty good.It does, actually. Yes.

49:51.640 --> 49:55.775
Well... I think
we are forever now.

49:55.949 --> 49:56.994
Yeah.

49:57.907 --> 49:59.039
Looks like
you'’re stuck with me.

49:59.213 --> 50:00.258
Mmm.

50:01.476 --> 50:03.696
I don'’t know about that
because...

50:05.350 --> 50:07.743
...you still have to prove
to me you'’re worth it.

50:07.917 --> 50:09.919
Oh, is that right?Mm-hmm.

50:11.138 --> 50:12.879
You know something,
you'’re worth it.

50:21.192 --> 50:22.671
What the fuck was that?

50:22.845 --> 50:25.196
A fucking ambush.Someone tipped her off.

50:25.370 --> 50:26.849
Ramon'’s a lot of things,
but he'’s not a rat.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.590
Who the fuck is her?

50:29.591 --> 50:31.289
Victoria Ventura
De La Cruz-Santana.

50:31.463 --> 50:33.160
What?I take it
you'’ve heard of her.

50:33.334 --> 50:34.553
Yeah.
Everybody'’s heard of her.

50:34.727 --> 50:36.468
How do you know her?I just know her.

50:36.642 --> 50:39.210
How?Like I fucking
know her, Javi!

50:46.347 --> 50:47.348
I'’m sorry.

50:49.829 --> 50:51.309
Look, I didn'’t mean
for any of this.

50:52.484 --> 50:54.312
Man, I did good
back there though, no?

50:59.143 --> 51:00.448
Yeah, mate. You did good.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.929
What! You don'’t fuck
with Javier Manuel!

51:03.103 --> 51:04.104
Okay.

51:05.627 --> 51:07.020
Should I drive?No.

51:07.194 --> 51:10.719
Are you sure?
I... Okay.

51:56.591 --> 51:58.245
What is this?
Where are we?

51:58.419 --> 52:00.073
My abuelito'’sold cow farm.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.467
It'’s off the grid.
No one'’s finding us here.

52:02.641 --> 52:04.817
Mmm. Where'’s Abuelito?

52:04.991 --> 52:06.906
Heaven.I'’m sorry, man.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.995
Nah. He was
a mean old man anyway.

52:09.169 --> 52:10.388
Oh, fuck him then.

52:13.739 --> 52:14.827
Wow.

52:15.480 --> 52:16.481
Power?

52:16.655 --> 52:18.222
It'’s a generator situation.

52:21.442 --> 52:22.661
Are you turning it on?

52:22.835 --> 52:24.793
One sec, man.
I just got in.

52:24.967 --> 52:26.404
Can I put my shit down?

52:28.188 --> 52:30.756
My shit'’s down.
It'’s in the shed out back.

52:35.587 --> 52:38.155
I know you don'’t think
I'’m going out there
in these shoes.

52:40.287 --> 52:41.462
I'’ll go with you.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.121
Jean-Pierre.

52:50.950 --> 52:55.302
I stepped in a pile
of my own dog'’s shit today.

52:55.476 --> 52:57.391
Now I know my little Pepito
would never shit

52:57.565 --> 52:59.741
where I was walking
on purpose.

52:59.915 --> 53:03.615
So why am I stepping in shit?
Don'’t we have someone for this?

53:04.442 --> 53:06.270
He'’s not doing his job, boss.

53:06.444 --> 53:08.446
No, he'’s not
doing his job at all.

53:08.620 --> 53:09.751
Kill him.

53:10.665 --> 53:14.408
My little Pepito.
I miss his face.

53:14.582 --> 53:16.149
He'’s a cute puppy, eh, boss?

53:16.323 --> 53:17.933
The cutest.

53:28.161 --> 53:29.815
I heard you stepped in shit.

53:29.989 --> 53:32.121
Barefoot.Ooh. The worst.

53:32.296 --> 53:33.862
You have something for me?

53:35.690 --> 53:37.866
You don'’t need to count.I know.

53:40.129 --> 53:41.696
Do you remember
when we first met?

53:41.870 --> 53:42.871
Yeah, of course.

53:49.051 --> 53:51.445
It'’s a shame.
She was pretty.

53:53.273 --> 53:54.405
Very pretty, boss.

54:07.896 --> 54:11.117
I wanted no survivors.
And yet here you are.

54:12.640 --> 54:15.208
I made a call to a bar,
my bar,

54:15.382 --> 54:17.428
right outside the border
to intercept you...

54:22.911 --> 54:24.565
That'’s a rough bar.

54:24.739 --> 54:26.219
I'’m lucky
Valentina was there.

54:32.225 --> 54:34.183
She interfered
with my business.

54:34.358 --> 54:36.055
She knows better.She'’s your daughter.

54:36.229 --> 54:38.362
The only reason
she'’s still alive.

54:38.536 --> 54:41.060
Was it a coincidence
that she was there?

54:42.191 --> 54:44.193
Maybe,
but I don'’t think so.

54:44.368 --> 54:46.195
When it comes to you,

54:47.240 --> 54:49.677
I don'’t think
there are coincidences.

54:49.851 --> 54:51.679
You got stabbed tonight.

54:57.206 --> 54:58.295
Fuck!

55:00.035 --> 55:02.124
It'’s nothing.

55:02.299 --> 55:05.214
Well, I bet that nothing only
missed a vital organ by what?

55:05.389 --> 55:07.173
Mere centimeters.

55:07.347 --> 55:09.131
Anyone else would have
probably bled out,

55:09.306 --> 55:11.612
but not you. No.

55:11.786 --> 55:12.874
You can shoot the boy.

55:15.181 --> 55:17.836
You can blow this boy up.

55:19.620 --> 55:22.449
Whew. Fuck.

55:22.623 --> 55:24.973
But he just won'’t die.

55:26.758 --> 55:28.237
Well, I'’m sorry
to disappoint you.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.717
Mmm.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.896
You'’re gonna break
your daughter'’s heart.

55:35.070 --> 55:39.553
This gun left
my daughter fatherless.

55:39.727 --> 55:42.948
Do you think that I can'’t kill
some pretty-boy drug mule

55:43.122 --> 55:45.342
who has been nothing
but a thorn in my fucking side?

55:45.516 --> 55:47.082
I'’m not a drug mule anymore.

55:47.256 --> 55:48.301
Why do you think that is?

55:48.475 --> 55:51.130
Because
I'’m difficult to kill.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.479
And you would lose
your best guy,

55:52.653 --> 55:54.133
which means
you would lose your money.

55:54.307 --> 55:55.352
Your best quality.

55:58.572 --> 56:00.835
I feel like
you'’re getting a little cocky.

56:01.009 --> 56:04.230
And I feel like you'’re using
my daughter as a shield.

56:04.404 --> 56:06.841
What do you think
your life would be like

56:07.015 --> 56:10.715
if I decided to separate
the two of you?

56:13.413 --> 56:18.070
I am going to marry Valentina,
even if it kills me.

56:19.637 --> 56:21.682
I'’d prefer to do it
with your blessing.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.383
I'’ve showed you my loyalty
and I have proved to you

56:26.557 --> 56:29.647
that I will do anything
for your daughter.

56:29.821 --> 56:32.519
We only have one more deal
left on our agreement.

56:33.433 --> 56:35.087
And I hope that deal
still stands.

56:36.915 --> 56:38.133
For all of our sakes.

56:40.788 --> 56:42.399
A threat?Ooh, no.

56:43.530 --> 56:46.315
Please.
I would never threaten you.

56:48.579 --> 56:50.145
We'’re family, after all.

57:02.897 --> 57:04.508
That'’s a lot of guns.

57:05.378 --> 57:06.466
Gonna need '’em.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.294
Must'’ve made
a lot of mistakes.

57:18.391 --> 57:20.306
I only ever made
one mistake.

57:25.267 --> 57:28.357
I fell in love
with the daughter
of a very dangerous person.

57:28.532 --> 57:30.447
Falling in love,
that doesn'’t
sound like a mistake.

57:30.621 --> 57:31.926
That wasn'’t the mistake.

57:35.843 --> 57:37.671
The mistake was
believing her mother.

57:37.845 --> 57:39.020
Victoria?

57:39.194 --> 57:41.066
She took everything from me.

57:51.337 --> 57:53.295
I'’ll head out with Marco
in the morning.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.734
You and Jackie stay here
and lay low for a while.

57:59.084 --> 58:00.564
I'’m on the journey now, coz.

58:01.608 --> 58:03.480
Yeah.

58:06.047 --> 58:07.875
Any other day,
I would just be at the bar,

58:09.050 --> 58:10.922
slinging beers for people
I don'’t want to know,

58:11.096 --> 58:12.184
who don'’t want to know me.

58:13.315 --> 58:16.318
But today, I'’m on the run
with my friend.

58:17.276 --> 58:19.017
For my friend.

58:19.974 --> 58:21.976
To rescue
the love of his life.

58:23.369 --> 58:25.110
It'’s fucking--
It'’s romantic, man.

58:25.284 --> 58:27.025
Javi, this isn'’t--

58:27.199 --> 58:29.157
And I'’m the getaway driver!

58:31.377 --> 58:33.814
Papi,I get to be that guy.

58:36.730 --> 58:38.515
I never get to be that guy.

58:42.606 --> 58:43.955
So you'’re stuck with me.

58:45.696 --> 58:47.524
And I get the big one.

58:50.178 --> 58:51.484
We have to leave tonight.

58:51.658 --> 58:53.094
It'’s already set.

58:54.226 --> 58:55.532
You think
this is your last one?

58:57.403 --> 58:58.926
How many guns are you bringing?

58:59.579 --> 59:00.493
Going out with a bang.

59:00.667 --> 59:01.973
No, white boy.

59:02.147 --> 59:04.453
I know something'’s
not right here.

59:04.628 --> 59:07.152
She has an army.
Why are you going alone?

59:07.326 --> 59:08.893
Because she'’s testing me.And if you fail?

59:10.111 --> 59:11.635
I'’m tired of running,
Valentina.

59:13.724 --> 59:15.552
If we run,
she'’s just gonna find us.

59:15.726 --> 59:17.466
And if she doesn'’t,
we'’ll still just be running.

59:17.641 --> 59:19.033
She won'’t let me go.

59:19.207 --> 59:21.296
A deal'’s a deal.And my mother is a liar.

59:24.386 --> 59:26.954
I will do anything
to keep us together.

59:28.826 --> 59:30.044
Valentina, we don'’t--

59:31.176 --> 59:32.873
we don'’t have
any other options here.

59:36.442 --> 59:38.096
And if this works...

59:40.228 --> 59:42.274
she said she'’d walk you
down the aisle herself.

59:42.927 --> 59:44.319
If it doesn'’t work?

59:53.981 --> 59:56.070
It'’s like a chainsaw.
Just pull harder.

59:56.244 --> 59:59.552
Oh, no, I know. I'’ve-- I'’ve--
I'’ve used those for...

1:00:01.075 --> 1:00:02.337
other things.

1:00:03.164 --> 1:00:04.470
I'’m not a lumberjack.

1:00:04.644 --> 1:00:06.341
Maybe the gas is old.

1:00:06.907 --> 1:00:08.474
What?

1:00:08.648 --> 1:00:10.389
You seem to know a lot
about generators.

1:00:11.303 --> 1:00:13.305
I own a shitty bar
in a small town.

1:00:13.479 --> 1:00:14.698
Power'’s always out.

1:00:17.483 --> 1:00:19.006
All right.

1:00:21.922 --> 1:00:24.664
Oh, fuck!

1:00:26.448 --> 1:00:31.758
So... who was that woman
at the gas station?

1:00:33.455 --> 1:00:34.631
I have no idea.

1:00:37.242 --> 1:00:39.853
So how long
you two known each other?

1:00:40.027 --> 1:00:43.770
Him? Oh, uh,
we used to work together.

1:00:44.858 --> 1:00:46.599
Doing what?This and that.

1:00:47.295 --> 1:00:48.340
Mostly that?

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:50.821
Mostly that.

1:00:53.432 --> 1:00:56.043
So... what happened?

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:58.132
Our boss--Victoria.

1:00:58.306 --> 1:01:01.788
Victoria. Yeah. She hated him.

1:01:01.962 --> 1:01:04.791
I mean, she hated everyone
who worked for her,
to be honest.

1:01:05.879 --> 1:01:07.838
Would punish us
for stupid things.

1:01:08.012 --> 1:01:09.535
Make us clean up
her dog'’s shit.

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:10.971
Things like that.

1:01:11.145 --> 1:01:13.495
But not him.
Oh, no.

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:16.150
He was the fuckin'’ best.
A beast.

1:01:18.065 --> 1:01:22.156
Also... impossible to kill.
Like a fucking roach.

1:01:22.330 --> 1:01:23.854
And she hated that about him.

1:01:24.028 --> 1:01:25.377
She wanted him dead?

1:01:25.551 --> 1:01:27.466
Oh, since the moment
she laid eyes on him. Yeah.

1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:29.337
So why didn'’t she do it?

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:35.517
Someone was protecting him.

1:01:37.911 --> 1:01:39.608
Her daughter. Valentina.

1:01:41.001 --> 1:01:42.873
She loved him.
And he loves her.

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.918
"Loved"?

1:01:45.092 --> 1:01:46.485
Well, she doesn'’t know
he'’s alive.

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:50.358
And he didn'’t know she was alive
until I showed up.

1:01:52.491 --> 1:01:53.579
So...

1:01:55.494 --> 1:01:56.713
why did you show up?

1:01:59.890 --> 1:02:00.934
I owe him.

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:04.677
I said it was for the money,
but I owe him.

1:02:07.071 --> 1:02:09.073
You know the dog shit duty?

1:02:09.247 --> 1:02:11.858
It was my turn one day,
and I said, "No, fuck it.

1:02:12.032 --> 1:02:13.251
I'’m not a fucking lackey.

1:02:14.252 --> 1:02:16.907
I'’m a goddamn
professional assassin."

1:02:17.081 --> 1:02:19.431
As you can imagine,
that didn'’t sit well with her.

1:02:19.605 --> 1:02:20.911
Who did she send after me?

1:02:21.085 --> 1:02:23.478
The one person who could
actually pull it off.

1:02:26.612 --> 1:02:29.136
Thing is, he didn'’t show.

1:02:30.572 --> 1:02:34.185
He took the money,
took her daughter and they ran.

1:02:34.359 --> 1:02:39.103
And the fucked-up thing
is that I would have done it.

1:02:39.277 --> 1:02:43.020
I would have taken the money
and put a bullet in his head
if she asked me to.

1:02:47.067 --> 1:02:48.547
That'’s why I showed up.

1:02:52.072 --> 1:02:53.552
I am alive
because he has honor.

1:02:55.162 --> 1:02:57.556
And honor is something
you show up for.

1:03:06.565 --> 1:03:07.914
You wanna try the genny
one more time?

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:09.786
Yes, I think I will.

1:03:12.179 --> 1:03:13.702
Did I do it?

1:03:13.877 --> 1:03:16.357
That wasn'’t the genny.

1:03:19.752 --> 1:03:21.014
Shit.How did they find us?

1:03:21.188 --> 1:03:22.537
We gotta go! We gotta go.

1:03:24.757 --> 1:03:26.324
What the fuck?

1:03:28.456 --> 1:03:29.588
Fuck.

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:33.374
She found us.

1:04:10.237 --> 1:04:12.326
You look beautiful,
my daughter.

1:04:18.332 --> 1:04:20.160
What are you doing here, mom?

1:04:26.123 --> 1:04:27.472
Marco!

1:04:35.349 --> 1:04:36.307
Javi!

1:04:40.354 --> 1:04:43.444
Did you think I would miss
my daughter'’s wedding?

1:04:43.618 --> 1:04:46.360
Valentina.

1:04:48.406 --> 1:04:50.930
There'’s only one target
that I have never hit.

1:04:51.104 --> 1:04:53.846
I'’m begging you.

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:55.935
Mama, please.

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:57.806
I love him.

1:04:59.373 --> 1:05:01.462
How does that saying go...

1:05:01.636 --> 1:05:03.943
The pride before the fall.

1:05:04.117 --> 1:05:07.294
No, Mama.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:05:07.468 --> 1:05:08.513
Valentina!

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.048
You ready to be
the guy, Javi?Yeah.

1:08:42.335 --> 1:08:44.120
Who the fuck are you?

1:09:24.029 --> 1:09:25.161
Oh, fuck.

1:09:34.866 --> 1:09:36.172
Papi?

1:09:39.827 --> 1:09:41.002
Papi?

1:09:46.443 --> 1:09:47.748
Javi.

1:09:52.927 --> 1:09:54.886
No, no, no.
You'’re all right.

1:10:00.979 --> 1:10:03.547
Papi.Shh. You'’re okay.
You'’re okay.

1:10:03.721 --> 1:10:06.158
You'’re okay. You'’re okay, buddy.
You'’re okay.

1:10:06.332 --> 1:10:08.204
Yeah, you'’re okay.

1:10:09.596 --> 1:10:11.207
I got to be that guy.

1:10:16.212 --> 1:10:17.822
I got to be that guy.

1:10:22.174 --> 1:10:24.394
You, uh-- You are that guy.

1:10:25.090 --> 1:10:26.134
Yeah.

1:10:27.092 --> 1:10:28.354
You'’re that guy.

1:10:29.747 --> 1:10:31.139
I'’m that guy.

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:33.707
I'’m that guy.

1:10:41.149 --> 1:10:43.239
No. No, no.

1:10:44.805 --> 1:10:45.980
No.

1:11:59.271 --> 1:12:03.928
No! Stop! No!

1:12:24.557 --> 1:12:27.430
No, no, no, no.

1:12:28.953 --> 1:12:30.084
White boy.

1:12:32.870 --> 1:12:33.958
Thank you

1:12:34.611 --> 1:12:35.916
for making me

1:12:36.090 --> 1:12:37.178
so happy.

1:12:43.446 --> 1:12:44.577
I love you.

1:13:02.290 --> 1:13:03.379
No.

1:13:18.655 --> 1:13:20.221
I didn'’t know.

1:13:57.998 --> 1:13:59.086
No.

1:14:07.225 --> 1:14:08.313
Bueno.

1:14:09.923 --> 1:14:10.968
Sí.

1:14:13.144 --> 1:14:14.885
I'’ll check
if he'’s still available.

1:14:23.415 --> 1:14:26.374
It'’s been far too long.

1:14:31.510 --> 1:14:32.990
Oh, you don'’t wanna talk?

1:14:33.164 --> 1:14:34.861
I get it. That'’s okay.

1:14:35.035 --> 1:14:38.212
Maybe you just listen then.

1:14:38.386 --> 1:14:40.432
Did you really think that
you could get back to her?

1:14:40.606 --> 1:14:43.087
Did you really think
I would let that happen?

1:14:44.349 --> 1:14:47.265
You were my big fish.
And anyone who knows me knows

1:14:47.439 --> 1:14:50.529
I always catch my fish.

1:14:50.703 --> 1:14:52.488
But you refuse to die.

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:56.056
And so my fish
falls off the hook.

1:14:57.101 --> 1:15:00.713
And who catches my fish?
My only daughter.

1:15:00.887 --> 1:15:05.892
The only person
I love in this world
besides myself.

1:15:06.066 --> 1:15:10.070
You can imagine the moral
conundrum this puts me in.

1:15:10.244 --> 1:15:13.291
There are many things
in this world
that you can'’t control.

1:15:13.465 --> 1:15:17.469
Life. Death. And love.

1:15:17.643 --> 1:15:19.253
You fell in love
with the wrong person.

1:15:19.427 --> 1:15:22.213
That is--
That is not your fault.

1:15:22.953 --> 1:15:25.912
No. What is your fault

1:15:26.086 --> 1:15:29.960
is that
you were supposed to die
the day that I found you.

1:15:30.134 --> 1:15:33.137
But you cheated. You ran.

1:15:33.311 --> 1:15:37.489
And because you cheated,
my daughter was placed
in the line of fire.

1:15:38.795 --> 1:15:40.057
Holy shit.

1:15:41.624 --> 1:15:44.148
This is like
Romeo and Juliet.

1:15:45.149 --> 1:15:47.673
And we both know
how that ends.

1:15:47.847 --> 1:15:50.284
I wanted to kill you
for a long time.

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:55.551
But what would my daughter
think if I did that?

1:15:58.292 --> 1:16:01.861
I did make the order
that got my daughter killed.

1:16:03.646 --> 1:16:06.300
But miracles, they happen.

1:16:06.474 --> 1:16:10.304
Some people get second chances
and I'’m getting mine.

1:16:10.478 --> 1:16:13.569
And I'’m going to make sure
that you never get yours.

1:16:13.743 --> 1:16:18.574
You will never hold her
in your arms again.

1:16:19.836 --> 1:16:21.054
Or your son.

1:16:25.450 --> 1:16:26.625
My...

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:30.542
My what? Oh.

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:32.588
You didn'’t know.

1:16:36.113 --> 1:16:38.594
Why couldn'’t you
just let us go?

1:16:40.683 --> 1:16:42.467
We were so close
to a new life.

1:16:42.641 --> 1:16:44.512
A new life?

1:16:44.687 --> 1:16:48.516
My daughter'’s life was perfect
before you came into it.

1:16:48.691 --> 1:16:50.823
She never needed
anything from you

1:16:50.997 --> 1:16:54.479
and she never will again,
and neither will my grandson.

1:16:54.653 --> 1:16:56.742
You are a cancer.

1:16:56.916 --> 1:17:01.094
Everyone around you dies,
except you.

1:17:03.444 --> 1:17:08.972
And I think it is time
for everyone around you
to go into remission.

1:17:18.764 --> 1:17:19.983
What happened?

1:17:23.464 --> 1:17:24.944
No.

1:17:25.118 --> 1:17:27.425
Please, I'’m begging you.

1:17:27.599 --> 1:17:29.079
Please don'’t make me do that.

1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:32.735
You told me
I just had to watch him.

1:17:34.475 --> 1:17:35.563
Please.

1:17:45.008 --> 1:17:46.270
Who was it, Mama?

1:17:46.966 --> 1:17:48.228
No one, sweetie.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:49.665
Just business.

1:18:08.031 --> 1:18:09.293
I don'’t want to do this.

1:18:10.816 --> 1:18:14.298
But I owe her.
I owe her a lot.

1:18:14.472 --> 1:18:17.388
You know what it'’s like
to owe her.

1:18:19.172 --> 1:18:23.263
And maybe one day,
I'’ll be laying where you are,
but not today.

1:18:28.007 --> 1:18:29.052
I'’m sorry.

1:18:39.584 --> 1:18:40.977
Good night.

1:18:42.456 --> 1:18:43.675
Good night, friend.

1:18:57.645 --> 1:18:58.995
I love it here.

1:19:01.911 --> 1:19:03.608
It'’s where I feel happiest.

1:19:06.045 --> 1:19:07.699
Sitting here next to you.

1:19:15.141 --> 1:19:16.142
What is it?

1:19:17.753 --> 1:19:19.580
I don'’t know
what'’s going to happen.

1:19:21.191 --> 1:19:23.323
We never know
what'’s gonna happen.

1:19:24.803 --> 1:19:27.458
We'’re from
two very different worlds
white boy.

1:19:31.027 --> 1:19:33.246
Two worlds that collided.

1:19:35.466 --> 1:19:36.554
For a reason.

1:19:37.598 --> 1:19:39.383
And what'’s the reason?

1:19:39.557 --> 1:19:41.602
So that we could
build a new world.

1:19:43.517 --> 1:19:44.562
A better one.

1:19:45.258 --> 1:19:46.520
And if it doesn'’t work?

1:19:50.350 --> 1:19:52.135
If we want it to, it will.

1:19:54.398 --> 1:19:55.616
I want it.

1:19:57.967 --> 1:19:59.229
Me too.

1:20:02.014 --> 1:20:03.189
What happens next?

1:20:05.931 --> 1:20:07.498
Now I take care of you.

1:20:32.871 --> 1:20:34.960
If any
of your kangaroo bullshit

1:20:35.134 --> 1:20:38.485
comes back to bite you
and my daughter is involved...

1:20:39.704 --> 1:20:42.228
well, I think we both know
how that one ends, yeah?
