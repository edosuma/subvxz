WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:04.072
OK, THIS PARAGRAPH,
THE LANGUAGE
KIND OF SUGGESTS

00:04.072 --> 00:05.606
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT--

00:05.606 --> 00:07.408
GOD, WHAT IS TAKING
THEM SO LONG?
IT'S ALMOST 8:00.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.842
DON'T THEY HAVE LIVES
TO GET HOME TO?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.244
WELL, YOU KNOW
THE RULE--

00:10.244 --> 00:11.945
NEVER GO HOME
BEFORE YOUR BOSS.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.848
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST
GIVE THEM A GOLD STAR
AND SEND THEM HOME?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.651
JULIA, WHY DON'T
YOU COME OVER HERE
AND HELP?

00:17.651 --> 00:18.752
NO.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.454
NO, I CAN'T, BECAUSE
IF I COME OVER THERE,

00:20.454 --> 00:22.690
I WILL SMELL YOU,
AND YOU SMELL REALLY
GOOD RIGHT NOW,

00:22.690 --> 00:26.094
AND THEN I'LL
REALIZE HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN SINCE--

00:26.094 --> 00:27.361
YOU KNOW, SINCE
THIS MORNING--

00:27.361 --> 00:28.629
I'M CLOSING
THE BLINDS.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.731
NO, YOU ARE
NOT GOING TO CLOSE THOSE BLINDS.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.865
EVAN, COME ON!

00:31.865 --> 00:33.301
NIA IS GONE,
IT'S ONLY JEFFREY,

00:33.301 --> 00:35.369
AND I'M CLOSING
THEM REALLY SLOWLY.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.970
JULIA...

00:36.970 --> 00:38.306
LISTEN, LISTEN,

00:38.306 --> 00:40.007
IF YOU CLOSE UP
THOSE BLINDS,

00:40.007 --> 00:42.510
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST PUT UP A SIGN

00:42.510 --> 00:44.712
THAT SAYS,
"EDITOR DOING IT."

00:44.712 --> 00:45.946
OK, FINE.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.048
BUT FOR ARGUMENT'S
SAKE, SO WHAT?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.417
I MEAN, UH,
WHAT IF THEY KNEW?

00:49.417 --> 00:50.684
WHAT IF
WE TOLD THEM?

00:50.684 --> 00:54.455
NO, YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT,
TRUST ME.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.556
WHY NOT?

00:55.556 --> 00:56.790
WANT ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENS?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.058
MM-HMM.
OK.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.094
WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM,
ALL TALKING WILL STOP

01:00.094 --> 01:02.296
BECAUSE ALL TALKING
WILL NOW BE ABOUT US.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.564
"HI" TO ANYONE
IN THIS OFFICE

01:03.564 --> 01:04.998
WILL HAVE
THE FOLLOWING
SUBTEXT:

01:04.998 --> 01:07.668
SO, YOU'RE, UH,
SLEEPING WITH EVAN?

01:07.668 --> 01:09.570
OH, WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.505
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.241
AND 5 MINUTES AFTER IT
GETS AROUND THIS OFFICE,

01:13.241 --> 01:14.442
IT GETS AROUND
THE ENTIRE TOWN.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.609
IS THAT
THE FIRST THING

01:15.609 --> 01:17.811
THAT YOU WANT
THE PUBLISHING WORLD

01:17.811 --> 01:18.812
TO SAY ABOUT YOU?

01:18.812 --> 01:20.381
OH, IS IT, "JULIA WHO?

01:20.381 --> 01:23.083
OR, RIGHT, SHE'S THE ONE
WHO'S SHTUPPING STILMAN."

01:24.252 --> 01:26.520
NO, I GUESS NOT.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.023
IS JEFFREY
THE LAST ONE HERE?

01:30.023 --> 01:32.593
MM-HMM.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.627
WELL, HE'S GONE NOW.

01:43.070 --> 01:46.274
* EVERYBODY WANTS TO LIVE *

01:46.274 --> 01:47.875
* LIKE THE WANNA LIVE *

01:47.875 --> 01:51.845
* EVERYBODY WANTS TO LOVE *

01:51.845 --> 01:53.013
* LIKE THEY WANNA LOVE *

01:53.013 --> 01:56.817
* EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE *

01:56.817 --> 02:02.022
* CLOSER TO FREE... *

02:02.022 --> 02:04.458
* CLOSER TO FREE... *

02:21.742 --> 02:23.944
HEY.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.313
HEY.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.183
WHAT ARE WE
WATCHING?

02:29.183 --> 02:30.684
NOTHING.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.421
OK.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.491
YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.727
WILL, IF YOU'RE HERE
LIKE YESTERDAY,

02:39.727 --> 02:41.395
I'VE HEARD
THE SPEECH.
YOU CAN SAVE IT.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.796
NO, THIS SPEECH
IS DIFFERENT.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.333
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
SNAP OUT OF IT,
ALL RIGHT?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.336
MY GIRLFRIEND
LEFT ME.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.071
THE PERSON THAT
I'VE BEEN WITH,

02:51.071 --> 02:54.041
OFF AND ON,
FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.209
OK, OK, STOP
RIGHT THERE.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.844
SEE, YOU'VE GOT IT
ALL BACKWARDS.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.011
YOU DUMPED HER.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.113
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO TOOK OFF, WILL.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.250
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE WHO
MADE IT OFFICIAL?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.051
BAILEY, MAN,
EVERYTHING.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.453
YOU WROTE THE LETTER.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.054
YOU TOOK CONTROL
OF YOUR LIFE.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.990
YOU SAID YOU'RE
DONE BEING TRAPPED
IN A BAD SITUATION.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.158
I WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT

03:11.158 --> 03:12.426
IF I THOUGHT
WE HAD A CHANCE.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.994
YOU GOTTA GIVE YOURSELF
MORE CREDIT.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.264
YOU MADE YOURSELF FREE.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.998
TAKE PLEASURE
IN THAT.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.568
YOU DID IT
YOURSELF, MAN.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.569
BE PROUD.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.971
BE PROUD.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.013
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.415
5 FOLLICLES,

03:34.415 --> 03:35.816
ALL BETTER THAN
18 MILLIMETERS.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.786
ARE THOSE THEM,
THE LITTLE BALLS?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.720
(BEEP)

03:39.720 --> 03:42.456
IS THAT YOU
OR THE MONITOR?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.824
OH.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.029
HMM...

03:49.029 --> 03:50.130
IT'S A 9-1-1.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.100
THERE'S A PAY PHONE
OUTSIDE.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.768
OK.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.705
SO, I KNOW THAT
IT'S USUALLY 8 OR 10,

03:57.705 --> 04:00.040
BUT FOR ME,
5's NOT BAD, RIGHT?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.642
FOR YOU,
5 IS GOOD.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.244
BUT REMEMBER,
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO GET ALL OF THEM.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.213
LET'S SEE HOW
THE RETRIEVAL GOES.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.448
OK.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.782
SO NOW I GO OFF
THE PERGONAL?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.018
AND,
THIS IS WHAT,
THE HCG?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.019
EXACTLY.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.854
YOU READY THERE?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.023
YEAH.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.291
SO STOP BY LYDIA

04:17.291 --> 04:19.627
AND CONFIRM
THE RETRIEVAL
IN 36 HOURS.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.195
YOU'LL NEED ANESTHESIA,
SO HAVE SOMEONE
DRIVE YOU HOME.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.864
OK.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.701
WHO WAS IT?

04:27.701 --> 04:30.371
SOME PHARMACIST

04:30.371 --> 04:32.773
CAUGHT ONE OF MY STUDENTS
SHOPLIFTING.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.808
HE'S BEEN TRYING
HER MOTHER FOR HOURS.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.444
HE DOESN'T WANT TO
CALL THE POLICE,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.211
SO SHE GAVE HIM
MY TELEPHONE NUMBER.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.513
WELL, YOU'D BETTER GO.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.848
SHE'S PROBABLY
TERRIFIED.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.051
MYRA, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU NEED

04:44.051 --> 04:45.753
WITH A 12-PACK
OF CONDOMS?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.321
WATER BALLOONS.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.623
I DROP THEM FROM THE TOP
OF COITUS TOWER

04:49.623 --> 04:52.493
TO SPLATTER THE KIDS
MAKING OUT IN THE PARK.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.463
WHAT'D YOU THINK
I WANT THEM FOR?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.498
YOU THINK I NEED THEM
FOR SEX?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.166
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.434
IT'S POSSIBLE.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.869
I MEAN, WHY NOT?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.071
COME ON, DON'T LIE.
I KNOW HOW I COME OFF.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.774
I'M ABOUT AS APPEALING
AS SPINAL MENINGITIS.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.710
I'M LIKE THE FANTASY
EQUIVALENT OF BURNING TAR.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.245
LOOK, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO GUILT ME INTO NOT
CALLING YOUR MOM.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.481
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, OK?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.816
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU CALL MY MOM.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.386
MY MOM DOESN'T CARE
IF YOU CALL MY MOM.

05:18.386 --> 05:22.289
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO FIND HER.
SHE'S NEVER HOME.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.993
THEN YOU'LL GIVE ME
HER NUMBER AT WORK.

05:34.635 --> 05:37.671
OH. NICE TO WALK TO ART
WITHOUT ME.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.239
I WAITED AT YOUR LOCKER.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.476
OH, SORRY. I WAS
RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.612
I THINK MY ENTIRE
MIDTERM'S OVEREXPOSED.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.381
I NEARLY BLINDED
MY DOG LAST NIGHT.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.616
HEY, DEREK.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.519
ALMOST DONE WITH YOUR
PHOTOGRAPHY PROJECT?

05:51.519 --> 05:54.488
MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS, ALEXA.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.023
DID DEREK SHOW YOU
HIS PROJECT YET?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.024
MM-MMM.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.358
"IMAGES OF SONG."

05:58.358 --> 06:02.362
AN INCREDIBLY INVENTIVE
SHOT OF A ROSE
ON A KEYBOARD

06:02.362 --> 06:05.265
AND 8 CANDIDS OF YOU
IN ORCHESTRA.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.266
OF ME?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.367
MM-HMM.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.502
YOU'RE KIDDING.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.771
THE BOY IS FULL-ON
SPOONY, CLAUD.

06:10.771 --> 06:14.875
I'M THINKING
A DOUBLE DATE IS IN ORDER?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.109
IS THAT...

06:17.344 --> 06:20.347
ISN'T THAT
CAMERON'S JACKET?

06:20.347 --> 06:22.550
HE LEFT IT IN MY LOCKER
YESTERDAY

06:22.550 --> 06:25.853
WITH THIS LONG LETTER,
ALL APOLOGETIC.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.022
SO YOU GUYS ARE...

06:29.022 --> 06:30.658
YOU'RE BACK
TOGETHER.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.461
HEY, LOOK! IT CAME OUT.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.629
I TOOK THIS WITH A TIMER
FIRST PERIOD.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.965
ISN'T HE THE CUTEST?

06:42.570 --> 06:43.671
WAIT A MINUTE.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.405
YOU'RE LEAVING
ALREADY?

06:45.405 --> 06:46.807
IT'S 8:30, EVAN.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.008
SO?

06:48.008 --> 06:51.845
SO EVERYONE THINKS I'M AT THE
LIBRARY WRITING.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.447
WELL, CAN'T YOU BE
WRITING

06:53.447 --> 06:55.348
UNTIL, LIKE,
11:00 OR 12:00?

06:55.348 --> 06:59.419
NO. 'CAUSE CLAUDIA CAME BY
TUESDAY NIGHT AT THE LIBRARY
LOOKING FOR ME,

06:59.419 --> 07:00.554
AND I WASN'T THERE.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.022
SHE WANTED TO SEE
MY NEW SCHOOL,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.256
AND SHE COULDN'T FIND ME.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.158
YOU CAN TELL HER
THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH ISABEL.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.161
WELL, THEN I WOULD HAVE
TO LET ISABEL IN
ON THE SECRET,

07:08.161 --> 07:10.998
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE
PUTTING IT ON CNN.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.668
OH. RIGHT.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.905
THERE IS A SOLUTION,

07:17.905 --> 07:20.808
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIKE IT.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.910
WHAT'S THAT?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.111
(DEEP BREATH)

07:24.111 --> 07:27.047
WE COULD TELL MY FAMILY.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.021
UM...

07:34.021 --> 07:36.023
YOUR FAMILY.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.190
YEAH.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.927
YEAH, I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
TELLING THEM, TOO.

07:39.927 --> 07:44.031
THEY'RE BOUND TO GET ON MY CASE
ABOUT THE AGE THING.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.866
BUT I DON'T KNOW,

07:45.866 --> 07:49.002
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
I MEAN...

07:49.002 --> 07:51.639
I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS,
I'M HAPPY ABOUT US.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.141
SO IT MIGHT BE NICE
TO SHARE IT WITH THEM.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.046
THEN YOU SHOULD
TELL THEM.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.849
OR...

08:01.849 --> 08:06.687
OR, UM...WE COULD
TELL THEM TOGETHER.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.622
TOGETHER?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.924
YEAH. YEAH, WE HAVE
DINNER SOMETIMES.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.693
THE NEXT ONE'S
TOMORROW NIGHT.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.863
YOU COULD MEET THE GANG,
PUT NAMES TO FACES.

08:15.863 --> 08:16.797
HMM.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.032
UNLESS YOU'RE TOO NERVOUS.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.635
NO.

08:21.635 --> 08:26.006
NO, NO.
THAT'D BE GOOD.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.778
COME IN, COME IN.
DON'T HOVER.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.345
YOU'RE MAKING
ME NERVOUS. SIT.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.346
I'M ON HOLD.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.182
WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
CHARLIE SALINGER.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.185
I, UH...

08:38.185 --> 08:40.888
I TEACH MYRA...

08:40.888 --> 08:41.889
AT GRANT.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.625
UH-HUH. SO WHAT DO I
OWE THE PLEASURE,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.060
MR. SALINGER WHO TEACHES
MY DAUGHTER AT GRANT?

08:47.060 --> 08:50.831
WELL, UM...
I LEFT A COUPLE
OF MESSAGES HERE

08:50.831 --> 08:52.933
AND ONE
AT YOUR HOME.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.602
I JUST, UH...

08:54.602 --> 08:57.871
I JUST WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
SHOPLIFTING THING.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.974
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE
I NEVER DID IT MYSELF.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.644
ME, THOUGH,
I NEVER GOT CAUGHT.

09:04.812 --> 09:05.979
RIGHT.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.947
IT'S JUST...

09:06.947 --> 09:10.150
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THAT--THAT...

09:10.150 --> 09:12.586
I KNOW YOU'RE
A SINGLE PARENT,
MS. WRINGLER,

09:12.586 --> 09:14.554
AND SO AM I.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.390
OR I WAS
UNTIL RECENTLY.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.893
SO I KNOW HOW HARD
IT CAN BE

09:19.893 --> 09:22.362
TO HOLD DOWN A JOB
AND RAISE A CHILD.

09:22.362 --> 09:27.434
BUT MYRA SAYS THAT--
THAT YOU'RE NOT
AT HOME VERY OFTEN.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.604
MR. SALINGER,
YOU GOT ANY IDEA

09:30.604 --> 09:32.572
WHAT IT TAKES TO RUN
A JANITORIAL BUSINESS?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.875
NO, I DON'T. AND I'M
SURE YOU'RE DOING--

09:34.875 --> 09:37.010
THIS COMPANY, OF WHICH
I AM THE BOSS,

09:37.010 --> 09:40.848
SERVICES 9 OFFICE BUILDINGS
AND 71 PRIVATE HOMES.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.851
I STARTED THIS BUSINESS
IN 1986 IN A CLOSET

09:43.851 --> 09:45.352
AFTER MYRA'S DAD DIED.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.689
I HAVE BEEN WORKING
FOR THE LAST 13 YEARS
VERY HARD

09:48.689 --> 09:50.858
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE
AND CLOTHES ON HER BACK,

09:50.858 --> 09:52.760
SO YOU GOT NO RIGHT
TO BE JUDGING ME.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.028
MA'AM, I'M NOT
JUDGING YOU.
I JUST THINK--

09:55.028 --> 09:58.799
MYRA IS A VERY FEISTY,
SMART, INDEPENDENT GIRL.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.900
SHE'S BEEN TAKING CARE
OF HERSELF

09:59.900 --> 10:01.434
SINCE SHE WAS 7 YEARS OLD.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.837
WELL, THAT MIGHT
BE THE PROBLEM.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.539
BECAUSE 7-YEAR-OLDS
ARE NOT OK ON THEIR OWN,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.241
AND NEITHER ARE
16-YEAR-OLDS.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.544
THERE'S NO PROBLEM HERE,
MR. SALINGER.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.446
THERE IS NO PROBLEM.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.548
HELLO.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.717
THIS IS SYLVIA.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.586
MRS. HERMAN.
YOUR CARPET?

10:19.586 --> 10:22.555
THEY ACTUALLY
SAY STUFF LIKE...

10:22.555 --> 10:23.757
"BE HAPPY."

10:23.757 --> 10:24.992
"THIS IS GREAT, MAN."

10:24.992 --> 10:26.526
"THIS IS LIKE A WHOLE
NEW BEGINNING."

10:26.526 --> 10:29.963
PEOPLE FORGET THAT YOU
CAN'T MAKE THE PAIN
DISAPPEAR

10:29.963 --> 10:31.631
BY THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT IT.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.866
AND THEN THERE'S
ALL THIS STUFF

10:32.866 --> 10:35.836
ABOUT HOW...
HOW I'M FREE NOW.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.605
LIKE THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE SOME KIND OF GIFT--

10:38.605 --> 10:39.873
TO BE ALL ALONE.

10:39.873 --> 10:44.712
WELL...I'M NOT SAYING
IT FEELS GOOD,

10:44.712 --> 10:47.681
BUT MAYBE
IT IS A BLESSING.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.483
WHAT?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.786
IT'S JUST...
NOT NECESSARILY GREAT

10:52.786 --> 10:55.288
TO BE NEEDING
A PERSON LIKE THAT.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.589
LIKE WHAT?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.826
LOOK, YOU'VE HEARD
ALL THIS, BAILEY.

10:58.826 --> 11:02.095
DEPENDING ON SOMEONE
TOO HARD IS, UH...

11:02.095 --> 11:04.765
JUST ONE CRUTCH
INSTEAD OF ANOTHER.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.201
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME NOW

11:08.201 --> 11:10.603
THAT AA SAYS YOU SHOULDN'T
FALL IN LOVE?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.572
THAT LOVE'S JUST LIKE
ANOTHER ADDICTION?

11:12.572 --> 11:13.874
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.675
BECAUSE, I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU, JOHN,

11:15.675 --> 11:17.745
SHE WAS LIKE A CRUTCH.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.547
I STAYED SOBER FOR HER
MORE THAN ANYONE.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.416
AND THERE WERE
A LOT OF NIGHTS
WHERE I WANTED TO USE

11:23.416 --> 11:26.053
WHERE SHE WAS THE REASON
THAT I DIDN'T--HER ALONE.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.025
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE FREE?

11:33.626 --> 11:35.328
I'LL TELL YOU.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.865
IT FEELS LIKE...

11:37.865 --> 11:42.069
FRANKLY, IT FEELS
LIKE I WANT A DRINK.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.213
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

11:55.315 --> 11:56.716
(WHISTLE)

12:15.035 --> 12:16.536
HEY.

12:16.536 --> 12:20.774
I HEARD YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY
PROJECT TURNED OUT WELL.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.477
I HEAR YOU'RE GOOD.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.146
AND I,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.480
HAVE TO REDO
MY ENTIRE MIDTERM.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.884
MY BULLDOG TURNED INTO
BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.285
AND, YOU KNOW, 2...

12:32.285 --> 12:34.521
2 EYES.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.589
ALWAYS KEEP
THE LENS CAP ON.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.759
YOU DON'T WANT TO
SCRATCH IT.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.798
UH, HEY, I'M HAVING A PARTY
AT MY HOUSE ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.366
WHY DON'T YOU COME?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.501
OK. IT'S...

12:48.501 --> 12:51.771
IT'S GREAT.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.473
GREAT.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.452

GET THAT?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.488
I CAN'T FIND
THE ASPIRIN.

THE SALINGER RESIDENCE.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.427
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
FOR KIRSTEN OR CHARLIE
OR BOTH OF US.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.796
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
NOW THAT THE EGGS
ARE OUT?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.698
(TELEPHONE) MR. SALINGER,
IT'S MYRA,

13:18.698 --> 13:20.467
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:20.467 --> 13:24.071
MY MOM IS REALLY MAD
ABOUT THE CONDOMS...
WHO'S THAT?

13:24.071 --> 13:25.405
YOU WANT ME
TO GET THAT?

13:25.405 --> 13:26.606
NO, NOT NOW.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.241
IF YOU COULD CALL ME TONIGHT
ANYTIME BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.609
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK TO HER
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.611
I REALLY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
SAY TO HER...

13:31.611 --> 13:33.513
CHARLIE, YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HER.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.882
TALK TO HER.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.850
AND I'LL BE UP REALLY LATE,

13:36.850 --> 13:39.786
SO I REALLY, REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.321
MYRA?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.356
YEAH, UH, LISTEN,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.425
IT'S NOT A VERY
GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.559
HOW ABOUT, UM,

13:46.559 --> 13:47.727
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW
AT SCHOOL?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.262
YOU CAN COME BY
THE SHOP.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.500
MYRA? MYRA--NO.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.137
LISTEN, I'M SAYING THAT
IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD
TIME RIGHT NOW.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.442
Claudia: JOE, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT SHE'S MAKING
SOME HUGE MISTAKE.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.078
IT'S JUST, WELL,
IT'S A LOT OF YEARS.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.281
SO, WHAT, THEN YOU THINK
LOVE MATTERS LESS

14:08.281 --> 14:10.150
THAN THE DATES ON YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE?

14:10.150 --> 14:12.752
NOT IF THE DIFFERENCE
IS, LIKE, MONTHS OR YEARS.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.221
BUT, I MEAN, DECADES?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.088
SORRY, JULE.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.957
LISTEN, TAKE IT
FROM SOMEBODY

14:16.957 --> 14:18.858
WHO MARRIED A WOMAN
PLENTY YOUNGER THAN ME--

14:18.858 --> 14:20.460
AND BEFORE YOU SAY IT,

14:20.460 --> 14:23.663
OUR BREAKING
UP HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH YEARS.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.664

14:24.664 --> 14:25.665

14:28.501 --> 14:30.503
I MEAN, HE DATED
SOMEBODY OLDER THAN HIM.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.872
WAS THAT A BIG PROBLEM
FOR YOU, THE AGE THING?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.374
BAILEY?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.610
WHAT? I'M SORRY.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.546
I SHOULD
TRY HIM AGAIN.

SINK SITUATION.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.755

TALK TO THEM?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.457

A GOOD IDEA, YEAH.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.659

HE JUST STARTED.

15:00.867 --> 15:01.969
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THAT.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.371
NO. I...REALLY?
MM-HMM.

WELL, THEN WHY IS VICTOR

15:06.906 --> 15:08.341

SO, UM, LET'S
ORDER DESERT.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.623

20:07.707 --> 20:09.942
BUT SHE--SHE DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A CHANGE OF CLOTHES,

20:09.942 --> 20:11.143
AND SHE'S SICK.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.280
I TRIED TO TELL HER.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.116
HERE WE ARE, SPENDING
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

20:17.116 --> 20:18.451
SACRIFICING SO MUCH.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.952
IT'S ALL WE WANT...

20:19.952 --> 20:23.890
AND--AND PUT HER
ON A BUS?

20:29.829 --> 20:33.766
SO, EVERYONE REALLY
MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.370
I HOPE YOU TOLD THEM
HOW BAD I FELT.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.974
YOU FELT
PRETTY BAD, HUH?

20:41.974 --> 20:43.610
JULIA, I HAD NO IDEA

20:43.610 --> 20:47.213
THAT THAT MEETING
WOULD GO ON SO LONG.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.581
HMM. YEAH, WELL,
THE THING IS,

20:48.581 --> 20:49.882
MOST OF US
LIVE AT THE HOUSE,

20:49.882 --> 20:52.084
SO YOU COULD ALWAYS
STOP BY ANYTIME

20:52.084 --> 20:54.020
IF YOU WANTED
TO MEET EVERYONE.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.622
YEAH.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.456
THEN I WILL.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.724
SO, LISTEN, ABOUT THIS--

20:57.724 --> 21:00.026
WE COULD EVEN
PICK A NIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.595
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.500
UM...SURE.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.402
YOU KNOW THAT MY SCHEDULE'S
PRETTY TIGHT.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.737
NO, I KNOW,

21:10.737 --> 21:13.105
SO WHY DON'T YOU PICK
A NIGHT THAT WORKS?

21:13.105 --> 21:14.341
WELL, THAT'S GONNA
BE TOUGH.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.675
I GOT A LOT OF NIGHTS--

21:15.675 --> 21:17.944
EVAN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
NOT WASTE OUR TIME

21:17.944 --> 21:19.078
AND ADMIT IT--

21:19.078 --> 21:20.246
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MEET THEM.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.549
JULIA, HOLD ON--
THEN PICK A NIGHT,

21:22.549 --> 21:25.618
AND I'LL BRING THEM HERE SO
YOU CAN'T WRIGGLE OUT OF IT.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.789
LOOK, UM...WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

21:29.789 --> 21:32.725
AM I SURE ABOUT
MEETING YOUR FAMILY?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.026
NO. NO.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.796
WOULD I LIKE TO WAIT UNTIL
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER LONGER?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.631
WHY NOT?

21:38.631 --> 21:42.001
WOULD I MEET THEM TOMORROW

21:42.001 --> 21:45.004
IF IT WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY?

21:45.004 --> 21:47.407
OF COURSE.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.512
SO, WOULD THAT MAKE YOU
HAPPY, JULIA?

21:52.512 --> 21:55.615
HOW CAN I MAKE YOU HAPPY?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.952
THIS IS THE BIG IDEA?

21:59.952 --> 22:02.622
YOU GUYS DRAGGED ME ALL
THE WAY DOWN HERE FOR THIS?

22:02.622 --> 22:04.156
NO. IT'S FOR
WHAT'S INSIDE.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.558
A STRIP CLUB?

22:05.558 --> 22:07.226
WHAT? IT'S GETTING YOU
OUT OF THE HOUSE, MAN.

22:07.226 --> 22:08.528
IT'S HUMAN INTERACTION.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.662
HUMAN INTERACTION?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.564
STARING AT A BUNCH
OF NAKED STRANGERS

22:11.564 --> 22:13.400
WHO DON'T WANT TO BE
TOUCHED OR TALKED TO?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.535
MAYBE IT'S NOT
INTERACTION WITH THEM,

22:15.535 --> 22:16.869
BUT IT IS WITH US.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.638
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHILE YOU GUYS
DISCUSS THIS,

22:18.638 --> 22:20.973
I'M JUST GONNA GO,
YOU KNOW, CHECK
THE PLACE OUT.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.709
INTERACTION WITH YOU.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.111
"HEY, MAN, WONDER WHAT
SHE LOOKS LIKE NAKED."

22:25.111 --> 22:26.879
"WELL, PRETTY MUCH
LIKE THAT."

22:26.879 --> 22:30.650
GOD. YOU MAKE IT SOUND
TOTALLY CHEAP AND EMPTY.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.987
(MUSIC PLAYS)

22:53.205 --> 22:55.107
OH, COULD I GET
A BEER, PLEASE?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.147
DAPHNE!

23:01.147 --> 23:03.149
GRIFFIN!

23:03.149 --> 23:05.718
OH, MY GOD.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.353
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:07.353 --> 23:08.788
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:08.788 --> 23:11.090
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING HERE?

23:11.090 --> 23:12.425
WOW.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.093
GRIFFIN, YOU CANNOT
TELL ANYBODY

23:14.093 --> 23:16.262
THAT YOU SAW ME HERE, OK?
SWEAR ON YOUR LIFE.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.897
SWEAR ON YOUR MOTHER.
IT'S OK.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.199
NO. I MEAN IT, GRIFFIN.
COME ON.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.367
FINE, I WON'T
TELL ANYBODY,

23:21.367 --> 23:22.635
BUT YOU'D BETTER
GET OUTTA HERE

23:22.635 --> 23:24.003
BECAUSE BAILEY AND WILL
ARE RIGHT BEHIND ME.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.104
WHAT? WHERE?

23:25.104 --> 23:27.173
THEY WERE OUT
ON THE SIDEWALK WHEN I CAME IN.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.475
DAMN IT. DAMN IT.

23:28.475 --> 23:31.243
WHY DID YOU GUYS
HAVE TO--

23:31.243 --> 23:33.045
NOT ONE WORD.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.383
WILL, WHAT IS THE MATTER?

23:37.383 --> 23:38.751
I SAID YOU SHOULD
GO ON IN.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.986
WHY IS THAT--
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

23:39.986 --> 23:41.954
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY LIFE HAS BEEN?

23:41.954 --> 23:44.223
BAILEY WATCH. 24-7.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.458
CALLING YOU,
HANGING OUT,

23:45.458 --> 23:46.859
HEARING YOU
MOPE ABOUT SARAH.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.695
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HEY, IT'S MY PLEASURE.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.362
OK? YOU NEEDED A FRIEND.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.798
BUT CHECK THIS OUT, BAY--

23:51.798 --> 23:54.300
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE
HERE WITH A PROBLEM.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.268
LOOK, WILL--
'CAUSE MY PARENTS,

23:56.268 --> 23:58.137
THEY BASICALLY
LAID DOWN THE LAW.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.438
AND THE DEAL IS,

23:59.438 --> 24:00.907
IF I WANT TO KEEP LIVING
RENT FREE,

24:00.907 --> 24:04.343
I DAMN WELL BETTER QUIT
THE WRESTLING INTERNSHIP.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.478
"DAMN WELL BETTER"--

24:05.478 --> 24:07.446
MY DAD'S NEW FAVORITE WORDS.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.881
AND I KNOW,
YOU'RE LIKE THEM.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.583
YOU THINK THIS WHOLE
WRESTING THING
IS A BIG JOKE.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.920
BUT I ACTUALLY LIKE
THIS JOB, BAY.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.822
OK? AND I DON'T
WANNA LOSE IT.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.225
SO THIS MAY BE DUMB
AND GROSS AND PATHETIC,

24:19.225 --> 24:20.627
BUT, YOU KNOW,

24:20.627 --> 24:24.631
I SURE COULD STAND A LITTLE
DISTRACTION RIGHT NOW.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.435
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

24:29.435 --> 24:31.103
GREAT PARTY, DEREK.

24:31.103 --> 24:34.674
YEAH. IT'D BE BETTER
IF THIS MORON WOULD MISS.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.446
HAH! YEAH!

24:40.446 --> 24:42.682
ALL RIGHT.
OK. WE'RE BACK.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.450
I'LL COACH YOU, OK?

24:44.450 --> 24:45.752
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!

24:45.752 --> 24:48.655
WOULD YOU TURN IT
DOWN, PLEASE?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.990
SHE'S CONCENTRATING.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.159
OK. WAIT.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.729
LOOK AT
THE OBJECT BALL.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.231
VISUALIZE THE SHOT,
ALL RIGHT?

24:59.231 --> 25:00.232
WAIT.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.934
(KISS)

25:05.805 --> 25:06.873
YEAH!

25:06.873 --> 25:07.840
WE DID IT.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.776
WE WON.
WE ARE AWESOME.

25:12.812 --> 25:16.849
YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE
WHERE THE MUSIC'S
NOT SO LOUD?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.150
SURE.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.119
LEAD THE WAY.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.366
SO THAT'S IT, THEN,
WILL?

25:34.366 --> 25:35.802
YOUR DAD
ACTUALLY SAID

25:35.802 --> 25:38.537
QUIT YOUR JOB
OR MOVE OUT?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.939
NO DISCUSSION?

25:41.207 --> 25:42.675
WILL?

25:42.675 --> 25:44.944
WHAT? WHAT?

25:44.944 --> 25:47.046
I'M ASKING YOU
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.480
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.149
WHERE IS SHE
ON THIS?

25:50.149 --> 25:52.051
IS SHE
WITH YOUR DAD?

25:52.051 --> 25:54.821
WILL?

25:54.821 --> 25:56.088
BUDDY?

25:57.924 --> 26:01.027
ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS
ARE HAVING PLENTY
OF FUN WITHOUT ME,

26:01.027 --> 26:02.561
SO I'M GONNA GET
GOING, ALL RIGHT?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.430
YEAH, OK.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.431
CALL ME LATER.

26:05.431 --> 26:06.432
YOU GOT IT.

26:06.432 --> 26:07.800
SEE YA.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.970
WHERE'S BAILEY?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.104
WHAT?

26:12.104 --> 26:14.306
I DON'T KNOW.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.277
CHARLIE?

26:18.277 --> 26:20.079
YEAH?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.515
SO, WHAT DID THEY SAY?

26:23.515 --> 26:26.352
3 PRE-EMBRYO CELLS
DIVIDING.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.254
OHH! KIRSTEN.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.288
3!

26:29.288 --> 26:30.289
YEAH!

26:30.289 --> 26:33.092
HERE, LOOK, LOOK. THEY
GAVE ME A PICTURE.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.728
TOMORROW AT 4:00,
THEY'RE GONNA IMPLANT THEM.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.830
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE,
RIGHT?

26:37.830 --> 26:39.766
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

26:39.766 --> 26:42.534
LOOK AT ALL OF THEM
WAITING TO MEET THEIR MOM.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.870
GOD.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.138
MYRA, YOU SCARED ME.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.809
I NEED YOU
TO CALL MS. GREY

26:49.809 --> 26:51.077
AND TELL HER I'M FINE,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.545
TELL HER WHAT YOU SAID
WAS WRONG.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.115
UM...I'M GONNA
LEAVE YOU GUYS ALONE.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.955
MYRA...

27:04.223 --> 27:06.225
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

27:06.225 --> 27:08.227
WHAT I DID...

27:08.227 --> 27:09.528
REPORTING THAT STUFF,

27:09.528 --> 27:10.963
IT'S THE LAW.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.065
AND I SHOULDN'T
HAVE WAITED
AS LONG AS I DID.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.133
IM BEGGING YOU,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.102
JUST CALL
THE PRINCIPAL BACK

27:16.102 --> 27:19.338
AND TELL HER
THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE
BETWEEN ME AND MY MOM.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.440
YOU HAVE TO.
I CAN'T.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.909
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULDN'T...

27:22.909 --> 27:25.244
WE SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING RIGHT NOW.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.581
I HAVE TO TAKE
A STEP BACK, MYRA.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.450
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

27:31.450 --> 27:35.354
I WISH THAT I DID,
BUT I...

27:35.354 --> 27:37.023
YOU HAD THE TIME BEFORE.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.557
I DID. I DID.
I KNOW.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.260
BUT THERE'S SOME STUFF
GOING ON WITH ME NOW,
AND--

27:41.260 --> 27:42.729
YOU CAN'T JUST...

27:42.729 --> 27:44.764
PRETEND TO BE
SOMEBODY'S FRIEND

27:44.764 --> 27:46.132
AND TUTOR ME

27:46.132 --> 27:48.801
AND GET ME TO TELL YOU
MY LIFE

27:48.801 --> 27:50.402
AND THEN JUST DROP ME!

27:50.402 --> 27:52.204
MYRA, I'M YOUR TEACHER,
OK?

27:52.204 --> 27:54.907
AND IF WE'RE FRIENDS,
IT'S IN THE CLASSROOM.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.910
YOU CAN'T--YOU CAN'T
JUST CALL MY HOME,

27:57.910 --> 27:59.946
AND YOU CAN'T
STOP BY HERE UNINVITED.

27:59.946 --> 28:01.413
JUST CALL MS. GREY,

28:01.413 --> 28:03.049
AND TAKE BACK
WHAT YOU SAID,

28:03.049 --> 28:05.752
AND I WON'T BOTHER YOU
ANYMORE.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.054
I CAN'T. I CAN'T
TAKE IT BACK NOW.

28:09.856 --> 28:12.191
IT'S OUT OF MY HANDS NOW.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.461
I'M SORRY.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.131
(BANGS DOOR)

28:21.801 --> 28:23.803
SO, UH,
YOU ENJOY THAT?

28:23.803 --> 28:25.037
WHAT, THE MUSIC?
YEAH.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.740
YEAH, I KNOW
IT DATES ME,

28:27.740 --> 28:30.642
BUT, MAN,
WHEN I HEAR GOOD SCAT...

28:30.642 --> 28:32.044
LOOK, EVAN, IT'S--

28:32.044 --> 28:34.513
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, OK?

28:34.513 --> 28:37.884
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO WAIT
UNTIL WE'RE IN THIS LONGER.
I GET THAT.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.151
YOU GET WHAT?

28:39.151 --> 28:42.021
BUT THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT IS HOW THAT FEELS.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.356
JULIA--
I'M NOT AN IDIOT, EVAN.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.193
I HAVE THE SAME ISSUES
WITH US AS YOU DO,
OR ANYONE ELSE.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.928
YOU'RE A LOT OLDER
THAN ME. A LOT.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.262
AND WE'RE
WORKING TOGETHER.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.965
BUT THE THING IS,
IS I GOT INTO THIS

28:52.965 --> 28:54.466
FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON--

28:54.466 --> 28:57.303
BECAUSE...IT FEELS GOOD.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.572
SO, WHATEVER
ANYONE ELSE THINKS
OR SAYS,

29:00.572 --> 29:02.541
I DON'T CARE.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.010
OK, GOOD, THEN.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.945
UNLESS THAT PERSON
IS YOU.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.948
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T
FEEL GOOD,
THEN HOW CAN I?

29:08.948 --> 29:11.350
JULIA, HOLD ON.
I FEEL GOOD.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.319
NO, YOU DON'T.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.687
NO. NOT...REALLY.

29:15.687 --> 29:19.058
'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE TO
HIDE WHAT YOU'RE DOING
OR MAKE EXCUSES,

29:19.058 --> 29:22.328
IF YOU FEEL ASHAMED
IN ANY WAY, THEN...

29:22.328 --> 29:24.396
YOU REALLY DON'T.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.308
HEY.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.609
HOW YOU DOIN'?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.078
WELL, I GOTTA SAY,

29:39.078 --> 29:41.047
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D CALL.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.682
I JUST PICTURED YOU
FINDING THAT NUMBER
AND THINKING,

29:43.682 --> 29:45.684
THAT CHICK?
THAT PARTY GIRL?

29:45.684 --> 29:47.486
TRACY, COME ON.
I CALLED YOU,

29:47.486 --> 29:48.787
RIGHT?

29:48.787 --> 29:51.323
YEAH, BUT WE BOTH KNOW HOW
DESPERATE YOU ARE.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.059
YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG.

29:53.059 --> 29:53.860
OK?

29:53.860 --> 29:55.294
OH--CAN I--

29:55.294 --> 29:56.695
DO SOMETHING?

29:56.695 --> 29:59.999
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING
ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND LAST NIGHT

29:59.999 --> 30:02.801
THAT IT SEEMED
THAT'D BE THE LAST THING
YOU'D WANT.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.204
BUT I JUST...

30:05.204 --> 30:08.440
WOULD IT BE
A HORRIBLE THING
IF I...

30:09.275 --> 30:10.843
WHAT?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.682
SORRY.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.250
I HAD TO DO THAT.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.319
UH...

30:20.319 --> 30:22.388
THAT WAS...

30:24.790 --> 30:26.058
ALL RIGHT. OK.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.860
WELL, YOU CAN SEND
ME ON MY WAY NOW.

30:27.860 --> 30:28.961
I GOT MY THRILL.
I--

30:28.961 --> 30:30.997
NO, NO, NO.
TRACY, REALLY.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.400
REALLY.
IT WAS REALLY OK.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.735
OK.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.271
OK.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.784
THERE'S A LIGHT.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.321
OH, HEY. WAIT, WAIT.
NO, NO.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.089
THERE'S A, UH...

30:57.823 --> 30:59.625
NIGHT LIGHT.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.527
YEAH.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.029
SHE'S IN COLLEGE,
BUT...

31:03.029 --> 31:06.065
MY MOM KEPT HER ROOM
EXACTLY THE SAME.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.434
OH, LOOK AT THESE DOLLS.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.435
YEAH.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.170
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.449
HEY, CAN WE MOVE
TO THE BED?

31:23.449 --> 31:25.784
UM...I...

31:25.784 --> 31:27.319
IT'S OK.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.155
MM--

31:29.155 --> 31:30.156
OHH!

31:30.156 --> 31:30.957

31:30.957 --> 31:32.358
(CHUCKLES)

31:32.358 --> 31:33.459
DEREK--

31:33.459 --> 31:34.961
SHH, SHH.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.662
YOU'RE HURTING MY ARM.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.530
OH, YEAH?
SORRY.

31:43.802 --> 31:46.472
WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S THAT FOR?

31:46.472 --> 31:47.439
SHH.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.308
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
TALK SO MUCH, HUH?

31:49.308 --> 31:52.144
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT, DEREK.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.879
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

31:53.879 --> 31:55.647
NO!

31:55.647 --> 31:57.516
GET OFF ME. STOP.
LISTEN--

31:57.516 --> 31:59.151
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT LED ME IN HERE.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.419
OK, WELL,
DO YOU HEAR ME?

32:00.419 --> 32:01.653
I'M SAYING NO.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.522

32:08.727 --> 32:09.728
OW! OHH!

32:09.728 --> 32:11.463
OHH!

32:11.463 --> 32:13.599
OHH, WHAT THE HELL--

32:13.599 --> 32:15.367
(GROANING)

32:26.445 --> 32:27.713
CLAUDIA?

32:27.713 --> 32:29.548
LEX.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.417
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.986
I GOTTA GO.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.899
HEY.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.401
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.970
UH, GOT AN EARLY MEETING.
SORRY.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.672
OH. OK.

32:53.672 --> 32:54.840
SO...

32:54.840 --> 32:56.375
THANKS.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.176
YOU WERE...

32:57.176 --> 32:58.844
IT WAS AMAZING.

32:58.844 --> 33:02.014
YEAH, IT WAS.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.849
SO, UM...

33:03.849 --> 33:05.684
WHAT ABOUT LATER?

33:05.684 --> 33:06.918
SHOULD WE MAYBE...

33:06.918 --> 33:09.355
OH. GO AHEAD
WHEN YOU WAKE UP

33:09.355 --> 33:10.856
AND ORDER SOME BREAKFAST.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.391
I'M EXPENSING THE ROOM.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.659
OK?

33:14.660 --> 33:15.994
BYE.

33:28.907 --> 33:31.577
IS SHE ALMOST
READY FOR ME IN THERE?

33:31.577 --> 33:32.744
(DOOR OPENS)

33:34.746 --> 33:36.148
MYRA.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.754
MRS. WRINGLER.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.023
CHARLIE.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.625
COME ON IN.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.863
LISTEN, MARY ANNE, UH,

33:51.863 --> 33:53.765
I HAD A THOUGHT.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.567
WHAT IF, UH...

33:55.567 --> 33:58.570
WHAT IF MYRA
WORKED FOR HER MOTHER...

33:58.570 --> 34:00.272
JUST A FEW HOURS
AFTER SCHOOL?

34:00.272 --> 34:01.673
SHE'D GET SOME
SPENDING MONEY,

34:01.673 --> 34:02.808
SELF-ESTEEM,

34:02.808 --> 34:04.810
SHE'D SPEND SOME EXTRA TIME WITH
HER MOTHER,

34:04.810 --> 34:06.778
CHARLIE.
AND I THINK--

34:09.381 --> 34:11.617
I GOTTA ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.619
SURE.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.553
SHOOT.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.789
DID MYRA EVER
SHOW YOU HER DIARY?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.425
HER DIARY?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.193
NO. NO. WHY?

34:21.193 --> 34:23.462
DID SHE EVER DISCUSS
HER FEELINGS FOR YOU?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.732
AFTER SCHOOL OR WHEN
YOU WERE SPENDING
EXTRA TIME WITH HER?

34:28.734 --> 34:30.035
WHY WOULD SHE--

34:30.035 --> 34:31.170
I--I--I DON'T--

34:31.170 --> 34:32.438
CHARLIE,
WHERE DID MYRA SLEEP

34:32.438 --> 34:34.806
WHEN SHE SPENT
THE NIGHT
IN YOUR HOME?

34:34.806 --> 34:38.076
ON THE COUCH.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.579
DID YOU HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH HER

34:40.579 --> 34:41.847
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL,

34:41.847 --> 34:44.750
OR ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
YOU FOUND HER
ATTRACTIVE?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.618
NO.
NO, I TOLD YOU,

34:46.618 --> 34:48.620
I PICKED HER UP
AT THAT DRUGSTORE,

34:48.620 --> 34:49.888
AND, UH...

34:49.888 --> 34:51.523
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

34:51.523 --> 34:52.458
ARE YOU...

34:52.458 --> 34:55.327
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF SOMETHING?

34:55.994 --> 34:57.996
I'M NOT.

34:57.996 --> 35:00.266
BUT MYRA'S MOTHER IS.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.503
SHE THINKS YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH MYRA

35:04.503 --> 35:05.571
HAS BECOME...

35:05.571 --> 35:08.774
THE WORD IS
"INAPPROPRIATE."

35:08.774 --> 35:11.143
SHE'S SUGGESTING
IT'S SEXUAL, CHARLIE.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.145
AND MYRA,
SHE'S NOT DENYING IT.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.780
SEXUAL.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.782
WH--

35:16.782 --> 35:18.784
LIKE--LIKE WHAT?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.219
WHAT DID MYRA SAY?

35:20.219 --> 35:22.688
SO FAR JUST THAT
SHE'S VERY UPSET

35:22.688 --> 35:24.690
AND DOESN'T WANT
TO GET INTO IT.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.124
THAT'S...

35:28.660 --> 35:30.729
I, UH...

35:30.729 --> 35:31.730
I...

35:31.730 --> 35:32.798
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

35:32.798 --> 35:37.769
I MEAN, I AM SITTING HERE
IN SHOCK. I, UH...

35:37.769 --> 35:41.940
WHAT, SHE SAID
THAT I'VE BEEN SEXUAL
WITH HER DAUGHTER?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.909
YES, SHE DID.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.245
THIS IS...

35:48.013 --> 35:50.749
ALL I DID
WAS TRY TO HELP.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.184
AND SHE IS OBVIOUSLY

35:52.184 --> 35:53.785
A VERY...TROUBLED KID.

35:53.785 --> 35:54.786
I KNOW.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.887
I KNOW.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.424
BUT YOU SEE
HOW IT LOOKS.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.825
COME ON, MARY ANNE,

35:59.825 --> 36:02.394
DON'T...DON'T TELL ME
YOU BELIEVE THAT.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.296
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.866
CHARLIE,
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I BELIEVE.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.410
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

36:19.945 --> 36:21.647
HEY.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.684
I HEARD YOU'RE
NOT FEELING WELL.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.886
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU NEED?

36:29.788 --> 36:31.823
YOU HAD LUNCH, CLAUD?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.726
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.297
MM.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.499
YOU FEEL A LITTLE WARM.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.768
DID YOU TAKE
YOUR TEMPERATURE YET?

36:44.903 --> 36:46.972
YOU BEEN DRINKING?

36:46.972 --> 36:48.540
NO.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.810
JUST SICK, I GUESS.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.414
OK.

36:55.414 --> 36:58.216
NO LECTURE.
I'LL LET YOU SLEEP.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.891
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
JUST HOLLER.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.606
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

37:20.606 --> 37:21.907
HI.

37:21.907 --> 37:22.974
HEY.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.312
SO YOU GOT AN EYEFUL
THE OTHER NIGHT, HUH?

37:27.546 --> 37:30.782
THANK GOD
FOR DIMMERS.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.556
I WISH THAT I DIDN'T
HAVE TO...

37:37.556 --> 37:38.924
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.326
NOW, LOOK, DAPHNE, UH...

37:40.326 --> 37:42.060
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING TO ME.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.831
I'VE TRIED REALLY HARD
TO FIND A REGULAR JOB
THAT MAKES SENSE,

37:45.831 --> 37:48.500
BUT THIS JOB, GRIFFIN,
I COME HOME,

37:48.500 --> 37:50.235
I COUNT OUT MY CASH
AGAINST MINIMUM WAGE,

37:50.235 --> 37:51.570
AND THIS JOB PAYS,
GRIFFIN.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.271
IT'S RENT
AND IT'S FOOD,

37:53.271 --> 37:54.773
IT'S MORE TIME
WITH DIANA.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.041
I CAN ACTUALLY BUY--

37:56.041 --> 37:58.677
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN STOP.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.913
I'M JUST...

38:06.184 --> 38:07.619
I'M NOT PROUD.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.454
ALL RIGHT.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.821
YOU KNOW,
FIRST OF ALL,

38:09.821 --> 38:12.057
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY ANYTHING TO ME AT ALL.

38:12.057 --> 38:15.461
I MEAN, I'M THE CREEPY GUY
THAT WAS IN THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO...

38:15.461 --> 38:17.463
AND SECOND OF ALL,
YOU KNOW,

38:17.463 --> 38:19.931
PEOPLE DO
WHAT THEY GOTTA DO.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.634
WHO AM I TO JUDGE?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.336
AND...

38:24.336 --> 38:25.837
THIRD...

38:25.837 --> 38:27.839
I DON'T KNOW...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.676
I THOUGHT YOU LOOKED GOOD.

38:31.810 --> 38:32.811
YOU DID?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.346
OH, YEAH, IT'S...

38:34.346 --> 38:36.348
WAY BETTER THAN THAT
KINKY COP GIRL.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.216
SHE COULDN'T DANCE
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

38:38.216 --> 38:42.087
OR THAT OTHER ONE,
THE REDHEAD, WITH
THE, UH, THE SILICONE JOB?

38:42.087 --> 38:43.789
NO.

38:43.789 --> 38:44.856
I, UH...

38:44.856 --> 38:46.858
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.394
YOU OWNED THE STAGE.

38:48.394 --> 38:51.730
THANK YOU, GRIFFIN.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.302
SO, LISTEN, WILL,
I WAS THINKING--

38:57.302 --> 39:00.472
WHAT, THAT'S ALL
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME?
I WAS RIGHT IN THE POCKET.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.774
IF YOUR PARENTS
ARE STILL GIVING YOU

39:02.774 --> 39:04.209
A HARD TIME ABOUT
ABOUT EVERYTHING--

39:04.209 --> 39:06.512
WHERE'S MY EXTRA GAME?
I PAID FOR 2.

39:06.512 --> 39:07.646
WILL, LISTEN,
I WAS THINKING...

39:07.646 --> 39:09.615
WHY DON'T YOU
MOVE IN WITH US?

39:09.615 --> 39:10.549
WHAT?

39:10.549 --> 39:11.750
INTO THE HOUSE.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.884
ME, MOVE IN?

39:12.884 --> 39:13.885
REALLY?

39:13.885 --> 39:14.886
YEAH.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.154
THERE'S ROOM?

39:16.154 --> 39:17.789
IF YOU DON'T MIND THE BASEMENT,
THERE'S PLENTY.

39:17.789 --> 39:18.590
WOW!

39:18.590 --> 39:20.258
MAN, ARE YOU SURE?

39:20.258 --> 39:21.427
I MEAN, THIS IS, LIKE,
TOTALLY COOL.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.594
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.129
IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR ME,
TOO,

39:24.129 --> 39:26.832
YOU KNOW?
TO HAVE PEOPLE
AROUND RIGHT NOW.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.900
THIS IS GREAT, MAN,
'CAUSE IF I HAD TO QUIT,

39:28.900 --> 39:31.503
I WOULD HAVE TOTALLY MISSED
THE HOLY VENGEANCE TOUR.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.504
HOLY VENGEANCE...

39:32.504 --> 39:34.172
YEAH. IT STARTS TONIGHT.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.674
5 CALIFORNIA CITIES,
5 DAYS.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.175
IF I GET ON THE ROAD
BY TOMORROW--

39:37.175 --> 39:39.010
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE TAKING OFF?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.912
AH, I GOT
THE EXTRA GAME AFTER ALL,

39:40.912 --> 39:42.681
BUT THEY WERE HOPING
I'D LEAVE BEFORE I NOTICED.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.884
NO SUCH LUCK,
YOU GREEDY MACHINE. HAH?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.589
YOU KNOW, THE MORE
I REREAD THIS PASSAGE,

39:50.589 --> 39:52.924
I THINK...NO...

39:52.924 --> 39:55.427
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT...

39:55.427 --> 39:57.463
LYING.
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT NOT--

39:57.463 --> 40:01.166
JULIA, COULD I JUST,
UH, SAY SOMETHING...
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

40:03.602 --> 40:06.505
THE DOOR'S OPEN, EVAN.
IT MIGHT NOT BE
A GOOD TIME.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.740
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.684
YEAH, CLAIRE, UH,

40:18.684 --> 40:21.587
COULD YOU BOOK ME
A TABLE FOR 2 AT AUBERGE?

40:21.587 --> 40:25.090
YEAH, AND HAVE THEM
PUT FLOWERS THERE.

40:26.191 --> 40:27.392
ROSES.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.860
NO, IT'S NOT BUSINESS.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.195
IT'S, UH...

40:30.195 --> 40:32.764
IT'S FOR JULIA AND ME.

40:47.312 --> 40:49.948
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
ABOUT THIS.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.885
YOU WANT TO TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

40:57.422 --> 40:58.957
YEAH, I WOULD.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.372
(SIGH)

41:14.372 --> 41:17.042
(DOOR OPENS)

41:20.378 --> 41:22.247
SO THAT WENT GREAT.

41:22.247 --> 41:25.483
YOUR 3 EMBRYOS
LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.418
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
ARE YOU CRAMPING?

41:27.418 --> 41:29.588
NO. I'M FINE...

41:29.588 --> 41:31.489
EXCEPT FOR
THIS WAITING.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.658
WELL, YOU WANT
TO STAY CALM,

41:32.658 --> 41:34.025
SO TRY TO RELAX.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.661
TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.396
ARE YOU SURE THAT CHARLIE
DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE?

41:38.396 --> 41:39.497
I'M SORRY.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.166
HEY, HOW ABOUT
SOMETHING TO READ?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.934
SHOULD I SEND A NURSE IN
WITH SOME MAGAZINES?

41:42.934 --> 41:45.203
IF YOU COULD JUST CHECK
THE MESSAGES AGAIN,

41:45.203 --> 41:46.905
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

41:46.905 --> 41:47.939
SURE.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.675
THANKS.

42:07.626 --> 42:10.428
SO, YOU CALL ME
11:00 AT NIGHT,

42:10.428 --> 42:11.462
I COME DOWN HERE.
WHAT'S UP?

42:11.462 --> 42:12.664
I DON'T KNOW.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.600
I WAS JUST SITTING AROUND
DOING NOTHING,

42:14.600 --> 42:15.834
AND I THOUGHT,

42:15.834 --> 42:18.303
WHY NOT SIT AROUND
AND DO NOTHING WITH YOU?

42:18.303 --> 42:19.738
SO I PAGED YOU.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.707
DID I DRAG YOU AWAY
FROM ANYTHING?

42:21.707 --> 42:24.309
NO, NO. IT'S JUST
I NEVER EXPECTED
YOU TO CALL,

42:24.309 --> 42:26.878
UNLESS YOU FORGOT
YOUR WALLET
OR SOMETHING.

42:28.079 --> 42:31.282
TRACY, YOU REALLY GOTTA WORK
ON THAT SELF-ESTEEM.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.151
WELL, TELL IT
TO FRANKLIN.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.553
THE MAN SPENDS HIS LIFE
BREAKING ME DOWN.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.589
FRANKLIN. WHO'S...

42:37.589 --> 42:38.790
FRANKLIN--MY HUSBAND.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.059
CAN I GET A STOLI
AND SODA, PLEASE?

42:41.059 --> 42:42.227
THANKS.

42:44.930 --> 42:45.864
I'M SORRY.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.233
DID YOU JUST SAY...
HUSBAND?

42:48.233 --> 42:49.367
UH-HUH.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.769
HUSBAND?

42:50.769 --> 42:52.470
YOU'RE MARRIED?

42:52.470 --> 42:54.873
BAILEY, YOU CAN'T BE
THAT SURPRISED.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.675
WHY DID YOU THINK
I GOT US A ROOM?

42:56.675 --> 42:58.610
I GAVE YOU MY
PAGER NUMBER,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

42:58.610 --> 43:00.011
