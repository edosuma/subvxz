00:02.565 --> 00:04.971
The seven wonders of the world.

00:05.943 --> 00:10.047
Christ, the redeemer,
the Taj Mahal,

00:10.719 --> 00:12.754
the great pyramids,

00:13.659 --> 00:16.520
truly man's greatest achievements.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.280
But there is one man who
sees it differently.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.192
It is like a pylon.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.108
Karl Pilkington.

00:27.777 --> 00:31.428
I don't know the politically
correct term, moron, I think.

00:31.548 --> 00:39.440
He's a round, empty-headed
chimp-like monc moron, buffoon, idiot.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.648
And he's a friend.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.175
He's a typical englander and doesn't
like going out of his comfort zone.

00:46.416 --> 00:50.183
I just think it would be amazing
to send him around the world.

00:51.076 --> 00:55.289
What we would like to see is
him experience other cultures,

00:55.400 --> 01:00.256
other peoples, and see if any way we
can change his outlook on the world.

01:00.376 --> 01:01.927
I've been to many exotic places.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.184
I genuinely think travel
broadens the mind.

01:04.248 --> 01:05.200
I want him to hate it.

01:06.042 --> 01:09.072
I want him to hate every minute
of it for my own amusement.

01:10.179 --> 01:14.917
Nothing is funnier than Karl in a
corner being poked by a stick.

01:14.984 --> 01:16.047
I am that stick.

01:16.167 --> 01:19.302
And now I have the might
of Sky behind me.

01:22.231 --> 01:25.152
This is one of the funniest,
most expensive practical jokes

01:25.199 --> 01:27.723
I've ever done, and
it's gonna be great.

01:29.038 --> 01:30.303
Just let me go home!

01:30.423 --> 01:32.388
Jesus Christ.

01:36.973 --> 01:38.513
Karl, you may have seen

01:38.581 --> 01:41.558
this place in the film "Indiana Jones and
last crusade"...

01:41.937 --> 01:43.593
Petra, in Jordan.

01:44.558 --> 01:49.030
Extraordinary ancient city
carved into the rock.

01:49.304 --> 01:51.823
I suppose it's like a cave.

01:51.943 --> 01:53.736
In a way.
***

01:53.856 --> 01:56.131
I mean, I'd love to live there.
I'd love that to be my house.

01:56.198 --> 01:57.565
Would you?
It would be amazing.

01:57.633 --> 01:59.663
But what I say about things
like this is,

02:00.003 --> 02:03.399
you're better to be
in the cave across from it

02:03.519 --> 02:04.720
where you're looking at that.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.074
You're getting the nice view.

02:06.142 --> 02:09.009
The people living in this
are looking at my hole.

02:09.078 --> 02:10.185
Do you know what I mean?

02:10.305 --> 02:12.215
I always think about
nice houses and stuff.

02:12.335 --> 02:14.174
You're better off in the
council block across the road.

02:14.294 --> 02:16.429
'Cause you're looking
at a stately home.

02:16.549 --> 02:17.485
'Cause you're looking
at the niceness.

02:17.553 --> 02:19.102
They're looking at the grimness.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.271
Yeah. But you're living
in the grimness.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.158
We haven't seen the
inside for a start.

02:23.225 --> 02:24.726
You're saying that's amazing.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.661
I'm saying it looks
good from the outside.

02:27.024 --> 02:29.571
That's the sort of thing that,
on an estate agent, you'll go,

02:29.691 --> 02:30.598
"let's go and see that."

02:30.718 --> 02:31.866
Then you go, "hang on a minute.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.168
Why ain't it been sold yet?"

02:33.235 --> 02:34.035
There's a reason.

02:34.103 --> 02:35.437
The inside's not that good.

02:35.504 --> 02:36.571
Well, let me know.

02:36.639 --> 02:38.406
Let me know if it's worth buying.

02:38.474 --> 02:40.487
And, also, what does it face?

02:41.210 --> 02:43.745
'Cause if there's a shack across
the road, I'm not buying it.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.246
I'll buy the shack.

02:45.314 --> 02:47.028
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

03:21.617 --> 03:25.792
When I started this off, there was no
mention of going to places like Israel.

03:25.912 --> 03:27.572
Seven wonders of the world.
That will be all right.

03:27.692 --> 03:29.824
Where are they?
Nowhere dangerous.

03:29.892 --> 03:31.326
Oh, they're in Jordan.

03:31.393 --> 03:33.628
Well, what are we doing here?

03:33.696 --> 03:34.762
Israel's bad news.

03:34.830 --> 03:37.932
I don't know why we just
couldn't go straight to Jordan,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.101
see the wonder, go home.

03:40.169 --> 03:42.303
When we went to India,
there was none of this.

03:42.371 --> 03:43.404
We went straight there.

03:43.472 --> 03:44.639
There was no stopping off.

03:44.707 --> 03:46.574
Let's just nip to Afghanistan.

03:46.642 --> 03:47.475
There was none of that.

03:47.543 --> 03:48.476
Straight there.

03:48.544 --> 03:53.648
So why are we messing about here?

03:53.716 --> 03:56.551
I mean, maybe it's not that bad,
but all I know is, whenever you

03:56.619 --> 03:58.219
hear about Israel, it's problems.

03:58.287 --> 03:59.754
That's all you see on the news.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.290
You never have a "and
finally, a happy story.

04:02.358 --> 04:05.159
The world's largest marrow
has been grown in Israel."

04:05.227 --> 04:06.528
It doesn't happen, that.

04:06.595 --> 04:08.363
It's never a fun story.

04:08.430 --> 04:12.767
It's the... it's kicking off again.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.702
I sort of feel like that
relationship that that bloke

04:14.770 --> 04:16.803
had, you know, the one who
climbed a mountain and ended up

04:16.872 --> 04:18.206
caught in the rope of his mate?

04:18.274 --> 04:19.406
That's what Steve's like.

04:19.475 --> 04:25.813
He's caught in the rope and is
leaving me here dangling in [bleep]

04:25.881 --> 04:28.316
I'm staying out of this place.

04:28.384 --> 04:29.717
Do you know what I mean?

04:29.785 --> 04:32.120
You got blokes walking
around with guns.

04:32.187 --> 04:36.291
I just feel like I'm constantly
on alert, 'cause there is an

04:36.358 --> 04:41.329
edginess to it, isn't there?

04:46.302 --> 04:48.670
Aah! Aah!

05:00.883 --> 05:03.351
Ow!

05:03.419 --> 05:04.786
I can't breathe.

05:04.853 --> 05:07.221
Oh, my God.

05:23.672 --> 05:25.306
What?

05:25.374 --> 05:27.575
I don't know what you're saying.

05:27.643 --> 05:29.744
Stop hitting me on the head!

05:46.729 --> 05:48.062
Aah!

05:48.130 --> 05:48.730
Be good!

05:48.797 --> 05:49.397
Be good!

05:49.465 --> 05:50.565
I'm being good.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.033
Be good!

05:52.101 --> 05:52.867
Talk to me!

05:52.935 --> 05:54.102
Are you English?

05:54.169 --> 05:55.203
Are you English?

05:55.270 --> 05:56.437
Yes, talk to me!

05:56.505 --> 05:57.472
Who are you?

05:57.539 --> 05:58.439
What do you want?

05:58.507 --> 06:00.135
What are you doing
with the Israelis?

06:00.255 --> 06:01.833
I'm just here on a holiday.

06:01.953 --> 06:03.144
Yes, on holiday!

06:03.212 --> 06:04.445
You are a spy!

06:04.480 --> 06:05.669
You are a [bleep] spy!

06:05.789 --> 06:06.987
I'm not a [bleep] spy [bleep]

06:07.107 --> 06:09.317
You are a spy.
Who is your manager?

06:09.385 --> 06:10.785
What is the number of him?

06:10.853 --> 06:11.986
It's in me mobile.

06:12.054 --> 06:13.660
What mobile?
What is the number of him?

06:13.780 --> 06:15.044
***

06:15.164 --> 06:17.215
I don't even know me
mum and dad's number!

06:17.335 --> 06:19.942
Give me the [bleep] number
of the Shabach.

06:20.062 --> 06:22.880
Who are you giving this [bleep]?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.137
Sky! Sky! Sky!

06:25.257 --> 06:27.670
- Why Sky?
- Sky1.

06:27.790 --> 06:29.283
Sky 1?

06:37.803 --> 06:39.458
It's pretty...
pretty frightening.

06:39.854 --> 06:42.477
You know, most of the people...
Sorry.

06:43.439 --> 06:46.088
You know, I mean, the adrenaline, I was
shaking for about

06:46.208 --> 06:48.177
15 minutes after, you know,
that happened,

06:48.297 --> 06:50.532
but it makes me
realize I haven't got a clue, really.

06:50.652 --> 06:53.375
You have to know by heart a
telephone number

06:53.649 --> 06:57.318
of the back office of you, that you are
going to call them and

06:57.386 --> 07:00.617
tell them the secret word that
you decided before.

07:00.737 --> 07:01.891
You said the secret word.

07:01.935 --> 07:04.904
That means he knows that
you are under danger.

07:05.234 --> 07:06.380
There's no secret word.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.239
There should be.

07:07.307 --> 07:09.942
I haven't got one, honestly.
I'm not messing around.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.677
No one has given me a word.

07:11.745 --> 07:13.166
I don't know what number to call.

07:13.286 --> 07:16.682
I would have to call Suzanne and
say I'm in a bit of a bother.

07:16.750 --> 07:20.653
I wouldn't want to panic her straightaway,
so I'd say "how is everything?"

07:20.720 --> 07:22.655
And then I'd say,
"all right, listen.

07:22.722 --> 07:23.656
Bit of a problem."

07:23.723 --> 07:24.190
Okay.

07:24.257 --> 07:25.357
"I was taken away."

07:25.425 --> 07:26.770
She'd probably start going,
"what do you mean?"

07:26.890 --> 07:28.794
I'd go, "shh.
Quiet. I've got low battery."

07:28.862 --> 07:30.796
"Where are you? Where are you?"
"Shh.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.325
Don't shout, because
they can hear me."

07:32.445 --> 07:34.045
Where? What country?
Where?

07:34.165 --> 07:36.148
Well, you know where I am.
Where?

07:36.383 --> 07:37.717
You never listen to me, you see.

07:37.784 --> 07:38.893
You keep going on about
about your efforts.

07:39.013 --> 07:40.351
"Where are you?"
"I'm in Israel."

07:40.471 --> 07:41.370
"In Israel?
What?

07:41.490 --> 07:42.922
Where are you?
Where are you, sir?"

07:42.990 --> 07:44.846
"Yeah, you're right. You're right.
We haven't sorted anything out."

07:44.966 --> 07:46.333
I mean, I'm clueless.

07:46.401 --> 07:48.835
But I didn't know I
was coming to Israel.

07:48.903 --> 07:51.905
The fact that they teach that stuff
here means that it does go on.

07:51.973 --> 07:54.074
I mean, that wasn't all
set up for me, was it?

07:54.142 --> 07:55.656
That's proper training.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.149
That's what they do.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.045
Why would they have me?
What can I offer?

07:59.714 --> 08:02.532
They'd call the embassy up, say,
"we got Karl Pilkington here."

08:02.652 --> 08:03.975
"Who?

08:04.372 --> 08:05.948
Haven't got a record of him."

08:07.575 --> 08:08.934
I don't think I'd
even make the news.

08:09.054 --> 08:11.805
I'd probably get in the local paper in
Manchester if it was a light news day.

08:12.187 --> 08:16.493
"Karl Pilkington, Manchester, is
stuck in a hut somewhere in Israel."

08:18.177 --> 08:20.200
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

08:23.479 --> 08:24.905
Check the other side!
Fine.

08:24.973 --> 08:26.152
Go to the door!
Stay there!

08:30.431 --> 08:31.678
Good!
Okay.

08:31.746 --> 08:33.513
How you feel?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.682
Knackered.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.183
Huh?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.418
Yeah.

08:38.486 --> 08:39.553
Did that look good?

08:39.620 --> 08:41.721
These guys wait for
you in the corner.

08:42.018 --> 08:43.275
Yeah.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.427
I don't know if I saw
the gun or not, though.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.045
He looks like he's
from Liverpool.

08:48.165 --> 08:49.240
I thought he was up to no good.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.334
Yes.
He looks like a scouser.

08:59.864 --> 09:01.098
What is this all about?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.967
You know, I thought I was seeing
the wonders of the world.

09:04.035 --> 09:06.403
I thought I was on me way
to see Petra in Jordan.

09:06.471 --> 09:07.304
The plane lands.

09:07.371 --> 09:08.468
I'm in Israel.

09:11.209 --> 09:13.789
Not Jordan, you know,
where the wonder is.

09:13.909 --> 09:16.179
Israel.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.615
Yesterday, I spent a day getting
a bag put over me head.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.017
And then you turn around and
say, "oh, you might need that,

09:21.085 --> 09:21.985
with being in Israel."

09:22.053 --> 09:25.789
Well, I don't want to
be in Israel, then.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.557
Man, it can't be
that dodgy, can it?

09:27.625 --> 09:28.992
'Cause look at all the tourists.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.728
They sort of relax me a little
bit, I think, 'cause you don't

09:31.796 --> 09:34.030
keel up to go into a danger zone.

09:34.098 --> 09:36.066
But there is a lot of
people about with guns.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.901
You know, is it all
part of it, though?

09:37.969 --> 09:39.469
Do they do that for the tourists?

09:39.537 --> 09:42.205
Does it make the tourists feel
like, "oh, it's a bit edgy," but

09:42.273 --> 09:43.573
really it's not gonna kick off?

09:43.641 --> 09:44.708
It can't work out.

09:44.775 --> 09:47.844
At the end of the day, I'm
just not that into religion.

09:47.912 --> 09:49.279
Do you know what I mean?

09:49.347 --> 09:50.547
It doesn't excite me.

09:50.615 --> 09:52.115
I don't need it in me life.

09:52.183 --> 09:54.584
But because I'm here, you know,
Steve's sort of saying, "you

09:54.652 --> 09:55.852
might as well see some of it."

09:55.920 --> 09:56.953
I said, "well, like what?"

09:57.021 --> 09:58.488
He said, "well, the
wailing wall."

09:58.556 --> 09:59.189
I said, "what?"

09:59.257 --> 10:00.157
He said, "the wailing wall.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.291
It's really popular over there."

10:01.359 --> 10:05.328
So I'm gonna go look at a wall.

10:11.969 --> 10:13.336
This is all new to me.

10:13.404 --> 10:17.073
It's not like I've come here with
any idea of what this is about.

10:17.141 --> 10:18.008
I have no idea.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.576
They're all doing different
things, you know.

10:19.644 --> 10:21.945
Some are kissing the wall.

10:22.013 --> 10:24.147
He's nodding at it.

10:24.215 --> 10:27.317
People sticking bits of paper in.

10:27.385 --> 10:29.286
And there's bits of
rubbish in there.

10:29.353 --> 10:32.222
It's some sort of one of those insurance...
Oh, sorry.

10:32.290 --> 10:35.158
Like a form about insurance or
something stuck in that one.

10:35.226 --> 10:36.593
So, they even get junk mail.

10:36.661 --> 10:41.398
There's junk mail in the wall.

10:41.465 --> 10:42.866
It's a weird one, the wall.

10:42.934 --> 10:48.939
It reminded me of, like, people who write to...
You're not gonna get an answer,

10:49.006 --> 10:50.106
or not everyone, anyway.

10:50.174 --> 10:51.908
It's a waste of time.

10:51.976 --> 10:55.345
I always think about an alien...
If an alien landed and for some

10:55.413 --> 11:01.351
reason had picked me, and they go, "Karl,
you're our leader whilst we're here.

11:01.419 --> 11:04.921
Why do people do
this in Israel?"

11:04.989 --> 11:06.923
I don't know.

11:06.991 --> 11:13.029
Hard to explain that.

11:13.097 --> 11:15.966
It's not what I thought
it would be, Jerusalem.

11:16.033 --> 11:19.669
I had this vision in me head of
a place where, you know, Jesus

11:19.737 --> 11:21.004
was knocking about on a donkey.

11:21.072 --> 11:22.305
That's been shattered now.

11:22.373 --> 11:25.175
And everywhere you go, there
seems to be some other religious

11:25.243 --> 11:27.244
people coming out of
the woods somewhere.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.080
It is like pac-man, isn't it?

11:30.147 --> 11:32.082
You go down a little alley
thinking, "this will be quiet

11:32.149 --> 11:36.186
down there," and a load
of stuff comes at you.

11:46.897 --> 11:48.398
Nothing's ever easy, is it?

11:48.466 --> 11:52.239
You know, Steve said he sorted me out
with a lift to get back to the hotel.

11:52.359 --> 11:53.399
Well, that's nice of him.

11:53.519 --> 11:54.786
And then this lot turned up.

12:00.811 --> 12:01.975
My whole life, this
is all I want to do.

12:02.095 --> 12:06.638
I want to go around in this car or another
car every day and make people happy.

12:06.758 --> 12:07.600
Why not?

12:09.353 --> 12:11.180
Here's what we do
in traffic jams.

12:12.596 --> 12:16.530
They were nice enough lads and
that, but doing that is dangerous.

12:16.650 --> 12:19.716
And there's enough danger here,
you know, with, you know, bombs

12:19.836 --> 12:21.655
going off or blokes
walking out with guns.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.234
I don't need to add more danger
to me little trip by dancing

12:24.354 --> 12:25.522
about on a busy road.

12:25.793 --> 12:28.595
Do you know how many smiles
we're gaining right now?

12:28.663 --> 12:30.597
We could be saving
lives right now.

12:30.665 --> 12:33.767
Somebody, you know, who's maybe
depressed who wanted to commit

12:33.835 --> 12:35.168
suicide, now he's smiling.

12:35.236 --> 12:36.319
Now he doesn't want to.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.545
She's not smiling.

12:39.665 --> 12:40.733
Pass me a sticker.

12:40.853 --> 12:42.142
See that sticker?

12:42.210 --> 12:42.709
Yeah.

12:42.777 --> 12:44.211
Put it on the bus.

12:44.279 --> 12:46.266
She's terrified.
She's terrified.

12:46.386 --> 12:47.664
She's going, "for God's sake."

12:47.784 --> 12:49.556
She went like that
and locked the door.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.084
All right.

12:51.152 --> 12:52.319
The lights are changing.

12:52.387 --> 12:54.453
Lights, lights, lights, lights!

12:59.972 --> 13:01.825
We're not getting out again.

13:01.945 --> 13:03.169
Where are you going?

13:03.466 --> 13:04.599
Oh, for [bleep]

13:05.801 --> 13:06.868
And it's okay.

13:06.936 --> 13:09.838
I mean, I might as well
have got on a bus.

13:09.905 --> 13:12.660
At least the bus has
less stops than they do.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.909
I mean, every hundred yards, they
were getting out, having a dance.

13:14.977 --> 13:15.824
Please.

13:15.944 --> 13:17.891
Good stuff, huh?
Yeah, it's good.

13:18.011 --> 13:19.511
Come out with us.

13:19.780 --> 13:21.281
Come out with us, just for a bit.

13:21.349 --> 13:22.983
Come on.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.084
Two minutes.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.194
On a corner.

13:29.314 --> 13:30.807
Couldn't pick a dangerous spot.

13:30.927 --> 13:33.057
This is the most dangerous place.

13:43.716 --> 13:46.685
Yeah, I felt a bid bad jumping
out and legging it, but I don't

13:46.753 --> 13:48.386
like dancing, do I?

13:48.768 --> 13:50.396
You know, I don't dance at
weddings,

13:50.516 --> 13:53.304
so I'm not gonna start doing it on a dual
carraigeway, am I?

13:56.696 --> 14:00.680
I mean, there's really a lot of misery
in the world, but that doesn't help me.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.742
That's making me worse.

14:05.119 --> 14:07.888
They're causing all that beeping.

14:07.956 --> 14:08.789
Do you know what I mean?

14:08.856 --> 14:10.190
Someone's trying to
get to hospital.

14:10.258 --> 14:10.924
Their gram's dying.

14:10.992 --> 14:11.692
They're in the road.

14:13.928 --> 14:16.522
Get off the [bleep] road.

14:20.719 --> 14:24.441
Spoke to Steve this morning, and he said,
"oh, get yourself over to Bethlehem.

14:24.561 --> 14:26.309
See where baby Jesus was born."

14:27.021 --> 14:27.658
Bit of a problem, though.

14:27.778 --> 14:30.290
I found out it's in Palestine,
which, you know, that's another

14:30.358 --> 14:32.059
place I've heard nothing
but bad news about.

14:32.127 --> 14:35.763
Plus, I've got to get over the
massive wall to get to it.

14:35.830 --> 14:38.966
It's just ugly, and
it goes on for miles.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.101
I mean, they're not
messing about, are they?

14:41.169 --> 14:43.704
I kind of thought, "I bet
there's some way you can sneak

14:43.772 --> 14:50.144
under it or over it,
but there's no way.

14:50.211 --> 14:53.981
Well, you've got to call London
before we go over, mate.

14:54.048 --> 14:56.316
The person you're calling...
That's good.

14:56.384 --> 14:59.153
The man in charge of
making sure I'm safe.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.855
To record your message,
key hash at any time.

15:02.490 --> 15:03.657
All right, Richard.

15:03.725 --> 15:04.324
It's Karl.

15:04.392 --> 15:05.826
About to go over the border.

15:05.894 --> 15:09.596
If you don't hear from us in four
hours, it's all gone [bleep] up.

15:09.664 --> 15:11.231
I mean, that's Richard.

15:11.299 --> 15:12.499
That sums him up.

15:12.567 --> 15:13.934
He's always on the phone.

15:14.002 --> 15:17.171
So, of all the people to have
as our emergency number, you

15:17.238 --> 15:19.206
know, calling 999, it's engaged.

15:19.274 --> 15:23.377
Sums him up.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.579
That checkpoint was a bit weird.

15:25.647 --> 15:28.782
I mean, I sort of felt guilty, even
though I hadn't done anything.

15:28.850 --> 15:34.121
I've got a Palestinian fellow
meeting me called "case."

15:34.189 --> 15:36.590
Yeah, but I think I'm
meeting someone.

15:36.658 --> 15:37.658
Are you Karl?

15:37.725 --> 15:38.292
Yeah.

15:38.359 --> 15:39.660
Hi. I'm case.

15:39.727 --> 15:41.562
How are you?

15:41.629 --> 15:42.196
How was it?

15:42.263 --> 15:42.963
Depressing.

15:43.731 --> 15:46.433
Honestly, I didn't think it
would have that effect on me.

15:46.501 --> 15:48.535
I'm not that sort of
person, though, really.

15:48.603 --> 15:52.506
You know, if you're passing here
every day, it's not depressing.

15:52.574 --> 15:55.642
If you're waking up every
morning and seeing this ugly

15:55.710 --> 15:59.146
concrete stuff in front of your
eyes, then it's depressing.

15:59.214 --> 15:59.813
Be my guest.

15:59.881 --> 16:01.114
This is my car.
Safe?

16:01.182 --> 16:02.082
Huh?
Safe?

16:02.150 --> 16:03.417
Yeah, of course it's safe.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.819
I have insurance.

16:12.227 --> 16:13.560
Are these for us?

16:13.628 --> 16:14.294
Yeah.

16:14.362 --> 16:16.296
It's a gift from the holy land.

16:16.364 --> 16:17.331
It makes holy music.

16:17.999 --> 16:22.569
You won't think that
when I'm playing it.

16:22.637 --> 16:24.738
See, there's nothing
like that at home.

16:24.806 --> 16:27.274
There's nothing like
that anywhere on earth.

16:27.342 --> 16:27.774
No.

16:27.842 --> 16:30.944
We have a congestion charge that
caused a little bit of fuss.

16:31.012 --> 16:33.380
If you drive into London,
you have to pay £8.

16:33.448 --> 16:35.816
Everybody was like,
"this is an outrage."

16:35.884 --> 16:37.451
But it's nothing
compared to this.

16:37.518 --> 16:37.985
Honestly.

16:38.052 --> 16:40.187
This is costing the
people more than £8, man.

16:40.255 --> 16:43.457
This is costing
them their future.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.425
Is it gonna be busy in there?

16:45.493 --> 16:46.860
Well, check it out.

16:46.928 --> 16:48.662
Did you close your door well?

16:48.730 --> 16:49.630
Yeah.

16:49.697 --> 16:51.098
Is anyone gonna Nick it?

16:51.165 --> 16:53.967
I mean, some religious holy people...
lots of cops, so don't worry.

16:54.035 --> 16:58.038
People who are into religion
shouldn't be nicking cars.

16:58.106 --> 16:59.339
So, why are these a big deal?

16:59.407 --> 17:00.674
Why are we bringing these, eh?

17:00.742 --> 17:01.775
'Cause the Shepherds.

17:01.843 --> 17:05.579
"And the Shepherds came to the
site of birth carrying flutes."

17:05.646 --> 17:07.748
Watch your head, man.

17:07.815 --> 17:09.750
Anything you need, you
can ask us, okay?

17:09.817 --> 17:13.020
The flute says... No, you can't.

17:13.087 --> 17:16.356
The flute says that the Shepherds came
to the site of birth carrying flutes.

17:16.424 --> 17:16.957
Whatever.

17:17.025 --> 17:18.025
You cannot use it in inside.

17:18.092 --> 17:18.458
Okay.

17:18.526 --> 17:22.596
You just carry it.

17:22.664 --> 17:26.098
This is where Jesus was born.

17:26.166 --> 17:26.867
Right there.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.335
Right there.

17:28.403 --> 17:30.037
On this rock.

17:30.104 --> 17:31.271
You're allowed to touch it?

17:31.339 --> 17:32.172
You can touch it.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.007
You can kiss it.

17:34.075 --> 17:36.243
I think that's all
you can do with it.

17:36.311 --> 17:37.611
How do they know that?

17:37.679 --> 17:40.514
It's an oral tradition saying
that this is the place.

17:40.581 --> 17:44.051
But does Jesus want us to come
here and see where was he born

17:44.118 --> 17:47.120
and touch the stones and go
crying and blah, blah, blah?

17:47.188 --> 17:51.191
I don't think so.

17:51.259 --> 17:55.662
I think I'm with you on that.

17:55.730 --> 18:00.534
♪ Little donkey ♪

18:07.542 --> 18:10.577
I'd say the only time I had
religion in me life was playing

18:10.645 --> 18:14.114
"little donkey" at school, and
me mate Wayne, he was catholic,

18:14.182 --> 18:16.984
and he said, "oh, do you
want to go and do this?"

18:17.051 --> 18:18.719
And I was like, "piss off."

18:18.786 --> 18:20.053
And he said, "right.

18:20.121 --> 18:22.255
You just swore.

18:22.323 --> 18:24.391
If you don't come with me to
church, I'm gonna tell your mum

18:24.459 --> 18:25.926
that you told me to piss off."

18:25.994 --> 18:27.160
So I had to go with him.

18:27.228 --> 18:30.163
And in the end, I got chucked
out for bouncing a tennis ball

18:30.231 --> 18:32.566
sort of in the church.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.869
That's about it, but I think I
got more of a feeling from that

18:35.937 --> 18:38.138
wall than I did from
where Jesus was born.

18:38.206 --> 18:43.176
Yet people are going in there,
sort of like, "oh. Oh."

18:43.244 --> 18:44.111
I want to go over there.

18:44.178 --> 18:45.479
That's where you can have a tear.

18:45.546 --> 18:46.947
It's depressing.

19:01.614 --> 19:07.453
I've been here four days now, and
we're only just going to the wonder.

19:07.520 --> 19:13.592
But looking in the guide book, and
we passed the dead sea this way.

19:13.660 --> 19:16.628
It would just be nice for me to
have a bit of a restful day.

19:16.696 --> 19:18.430
Ricky doesn't even need to know.

19:18.498 --> 19:19.765
Looks quite good.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.367
I'm not a great swimmer.

19:21.434 --> 19:23.969
The good thing with the dead sea
is you just float about in it.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.571
There's, like, loads
of salt in it.

19:25.638 --> 19:27.172
It's another
experience, isn't it?

19:27.240 --> 19:29.742
It's another one of life's
little wonders, a proper wonder,

19:29.809 --> 19:33.979
a natural wonder, which is
the sort I like, really.

19:41.654 --> 19:42.788
It's not too busy either.

19:42.856 --> 19:47.793
I thought it would be
a right tourist trap.

19:47.861 --> 19:50.329
This is all right, this.

19:50.397 --> 19:55.901
Something that I read in a book, this
is the lowest place on the world.

19:55.969 --> 19:59.671
I know we don't normally have
sort of information on this

19:59.739 --> 20:02.207
program... not proper stuff, anyway.

20:02.275 --> 20:03.776
But that's a little bit.

20:03.843 --> 20:09.715
It's the lowest pl...
You can't get lower than this.

20:09.783 --> 20:11.183
I don't know why.

20:11.251 --> 20:15.687
I don't even know if it's true,
but that's what I've read.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.256
So, I might as well give it a go.

20:17.323 --> 20:20.893
Everybody else seems
to be doing it.

20:20.960 --> 20:30.402
Whatever I'm doing, I've got to do
it quick, because that is so hot.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.838
It's really uneven.

20:42.715 --> 20:45.918
[Bleep] you really do, you know?

20:45.985 --> 20:47.986
Come on.

20:48.054 --> 20:49.888
I don't even have to,
like, do anything.

20:49.956 --> 20:51.690
This is ace.

20:51.758 --> 20:53.759
Karl, what's going on with
your belly button, mate?

20:53.827 --> 20:58.063
What the [bleep] is that?

20:58.131 --> 21:02.868
Is that a [bleep] end?

21:02.936 --> 21:06.638
Or was that... was
that someone's gobs?

21:06.706 --> 21:12.446
It looks like someone's...
[Bleep] it is, as well.

21:21.821 --> 21:24.289
Phone.

21:24.357 --> 21:28.794
Come here.

21:28.862 --> 21:30.129
Hello?

21:30.249 --> 21:32.905
I'm just in the dead sea.

21:34.701 --> 21:38.003
Yeah, just floating around
with someone's gobs.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.325
Oh.

21:39.445 --> 21:41.573
There's old people in here just
clearing the throats and that.

21:41.641 --> 21:43.435
I just had some in
me belly button.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.865
That's what's floating above.

21:47.985 --> 21:49.591
[Bleep] knows what's
floating under me.

21:49.711 --> 21:51.416
Maybe that's why I'm
floating around.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.318
90% [bleep]

21:55.021 --> 21:56.288
90%.

22:00.260 --> 22:01.593
It is nice, though.

22:01.661 --> 22:03.386
It's good, this.

22:11.271 --> 22:13.005
I've been doing
work for four days.

22:13.072 --> 22:14.406
This is an experience, still.

22:14.474 --> 22:15.674
It's good for the program.

22:15.742 --> 22:19.077
I'm explaining to people how
it's loads of salt in it.

22:19.145 --> 22:20.512
You float about.

22:20.580 --> 22:22.948
It's good for your skin.

22:36.175 --> 22:37.001
This is the truth.

22:43.899 --> 22:46.907
He sounded a bit pissed off that
I was having a rest, didn't he?

23:02.335 --> 23:03.235
Oh, yeah.

23:03.303 --> 23:05.437
Passport.

23:05.505 --> 23:06.785
Where am I going?

23:06.905 --> 23:07.504
Petra.

23:07.572 --> 23:08.372
Petra?

23:08.440 --> 23:09.173
Yeah.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.680
Go? I can go?

23:14.112 --> 23:16.313
Yeah, it's good to be in Jordan,
but we could have been here days

23:16.381 --> 23:18.582
ago, couldn't we?

23:18.650 --> 23:19.883
Petra's only down the road.

23:19.951 --> 23:22.486
We could drive there, but
Ricky's come up with this idea

23:22.554 --> 23:26.205
that, you know, I meet a local bloke
called Mohammed who's got a camel.

23:28.226 --> 23:30.928
You know, how long's
that gonna take?

23:30.996 --> 23:31.996
My friend.

23:32.063 --> 23:32.830
Hello.

23:32.897 --> 23:34.729
We need to cross this road.

23:37.535 --> 23:38.836
How many hours?

23:38.903 --> 23:40.671
How many hours that way?

23:40.739 --> 23:45.342
At least 48 hours, two days,
full days with the camels.

23:48.279 --> 23:52.149
Hold here.

24:00.625 --> 24:02.192
Would you like some music?

24:02.260 --> 24:04.294
What kind of music do you have?

24:04.362 --> 24:05.462
It's just music.

24:05.530 --> 24:06.397
No singing.

24:06.464 --> 24:09.767
When I'm a little bit
stressed, it calms me.

24:14.572 --> 24:16.006
Does a lady sing?

24:16.074 --> 24:17.708
There is no singing.

24:17.776 --> 24:20.644
It's just a man on a clarinet.

24:23.681 --> 24:24.214
Ah.

24:24.282 --> 24:25.849
It is nice, isn't it?

24:25.917 --> 24:28.352
Very nice.

24:28.420 --> 24:29.590
Very nice.

24:29.710 --> 24:32.322
You teach me English song,
I'll teach you Bedouin song.

24:53.445 --> 24:55.345
How is it, my friend?

24:55.413 --> 24:56.180
Good, yeah.

24:56.247 --> 24:58.282
How is your ass, now?

24:58.349 --> 24:59.783
[Bleep] now.

24:59.851 --> 25:01.652
Look, you can see up here.

25:01.719 --> 25:03.420
It's going on for miles.

25:05.056 --> 25:06.824
It just doesn't make
sense, does it?

25:06.891 --> 25:10.227
Why do people live in the middle
of nowhere when you've got to

25:10.295 --> 25:12.563
travel that sort of distance
to get to somewhere?

25:12.630 --> 25:15.165
'Cause he was saying some people
have to do that once a week, to

25:15.233 --> 25:18.635
nip to the shops, and they get a big order
and then carry it all the way back.

25:18.703 --> 25:19.303
Move then.

25:19.370 --> 25:22.039
Move closer to the
shop or open a shop.

25:22.107 --> 25:24.775
What's it like where
we're staying tonight?

25:24.843 --> 25:26.677
Maybe we find Bedouin tents.

25:26.744 --> 25:29.746
Maybe we alone in the
desert with the sand dunes.

25:29.814 --> 25:32.015
Sometimes the
Bedouins, they move.

25:32.083 --> 25:32.950
I don't know.

25:33.017 --> 25:34.551
You must have a plan.

25:34.752 --> 25:35.452
This is desert.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.221
We don't know what the
desert keeps for us.

25:37.288 --> 25:38.655
We'll see.

25:46.568 --> 25:50.071
This camel's knackered.

25:50.138 --> 25:53.274
Keeps stopping every 10 minutes.

25:59.548 --> 26:01.615
I could be a good camel.

26:01.683 --> 26:04.418
It's just sort of
moaning, isn't it?

26:10.139 --> 26:11.604
***

26:20.068 --> 26:21.802
We're gonna carry
it now by the car.

26:21.870 --> 26:22.536
By the van.

26:22.604 --> 26:25.473
Yeah.

26:26.441 --> 26:28.042
That was a little weird, though.

26:28.110 --> 26:30.611
It was like a breakdown, a
proper breakdown in the desert.

26:30.679 --> 26:31.345
They turned up.

26:31.413 --> 26:32.346
Stick it on the back.

26:32.414 --> 26:33.481
You know, it's knackered.

26:33.548 --> 26:35.583
It's gonna cost you.

26:35.650 --> 26:37.218
But to be honest, it's
a bit of luck, that.

26:37.285 --> 26:38.119
'Cause I've had enough.

26:38.186 --> 26:41.322
I'm to here with this.

26:41.390 --> 26:44.792
Camels have been around for
years, the ships of e desert.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.527
That's what they're known as.

26:46.595 --> 26:47.962
<i>We've ended up with Titanic.</i>

27:07.049 --> 27:11.452
<i>As long there's not a major gale,
I'm sure it will be all right.</i>

27:11.520 --> 27:15.389
<i>He's got 14 kids.</i>

27:15.457 --> 27:20.127
<i>So, you know, me staying's
hardly an issue, is it?</i>

27:20.195 --> 27:22.897
<i>Do you see how the
camels stand up?</i>

27:22.964 --> 27:24.298
<i>Jump.</i>

27:24.366 --> 27:26.600
<i>You just strap the
bag to its head.</i>

27:26.668 --> 27:30.337
<i>Get in there.</i>

27:30.405 --> 27:34.708
<i>Let's get this done, get
the day done, get to bed.</i>

27:36.945 --> 27:38.679
<i>These are all his sons.</i>

27:38.747 --> 27:39.246
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:39.314 --> 27:40.014
<i>All his sons.</i>

27:40.082 --> 27:41.882
<i>But I'm not allowed
to see the mother?</i>

27:41.950 --> 27:42.283
<i>No.</i>

27:42.350 --> 27:42.850
<i>At all?</i>

27:42.918 --> 27:43.884
<i>Not even to say "hello.</i>

27:43.952 --> 27:44.885
<i>Thanks for having us"?</i>

27:44.953 --> 27:48.456
<i>No. Forbidden.</i>

27:48.523 --> 27:50.257
<i>No way.</i>

27:50.325 --> 27:52.426
<i>That's why the...
What if by accident?</i>

27:52.494 --> 27:55.463
<i>That's why the house,
it's covered.</i>

27:55.530 --> 27:58.566
<i>Say if I go to the
toilet and knock.</i>

28:00.168 --> 28:01.202
<i>"I'm in here."</i>

28:01.269 --> 28:02.970
<i>She comes out, I see her.</i>

28:03.038 --> 28:04.472
<i>That's not her fault.</i>

28:04.539 --> 28:05.706
<i>That's my fault.</i>

28:05.774 --> 28:08.809
<i>So what happens then?</i>

28:08.877 --> 28:09.944
<i>This is bad mistake.</i>

28:10.011 --> 28:14.482
<i>That's fine. Okay.</i>

28:14.549 --> 28:19.753
<i>Mr. Mohammed said they don't get
many guests here, so they're</i>

28:19.821 --> 28:21.422
<i>polite.</i>

28:21.490 --> 28:23.157
<i>There's a big pot or
something in there.</i>

28:23.225 --> 28:26.327
<i>That looked like
some sort of milk.</i>

28:26.394 --> 28:29.296
<i>I'm not seeing any cows, so I
don't know where it's come from.</i>

28:29.364 --> 28:31.432
<i>I'm not fond of milk anyway.</i>

28:31.500 --> 28:32.333
<i>It's not being rude.</i>

28:32.400 --> 28:33.834
<i>It's just I don't want to eat it.</i>

28:33.902 --> 28:35.870
<i>I don't want to get ill.</i>

28:35.937 --> 28:38.472
<i>I'm surprised they don't want me
to get ill, 'cause we're all</i>

28:38.540 --> 28:41.208
<i>sharing that little toilet.</i>

28:43.712 --> 28:45.842
<i>I'm in the middle of
nowhere, honest to God.</i>

28:46.314 --> 28:47.848
<i>It's moon-like.</i>

28:50.956 --> 28:52.272
<i>Eight hours on the camel.</i>

28:55.157 --> 28:57.057
<i>Well, I tell you, it's not funny.</i>

28:57.125 --> 28:59.577
<i>I mean, I reckon I've
done some damage.</i>

28:59.697 --> 29:01.417
<i>It was long, and it was hot.</i>

29:04.633 --> 29:05.633
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:05.700 --> 29:07.147
<i>Well, it's just...
That's what I'm saying, though.</i>

29:07.267 --> 29:07.982
<i>There's nothing to look at.</i>

29:08.102 --> 29:10.704
<i>It's not like it's worth
doing so many hours.</i>

29:10.772 --> 29:12.743
<i>After half an hour,
you've seen it.</i>

29:39.381 --> 29:40.414
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

29:40.482 --> 29:42.723
<i>Something has just
[bleep] run up me leg.</i>

29:42.843 --> 29:44.619
<i>Can I call you tomorrow?</i>

29:47.723 --> 29:48.689
<i>See you later.</i>

29:48.757 --> 29:49.965
<i>What the [bleep] was that?</i>

29:50.085 --> 29:50.970
<i>See you.</i>

29:57.744 --> 29:59.739
<i>Can we just eat and go to bed?</i>

30:00.900 --> 30:04.271
<i>I didn't look for this.</i>

30:04.339 --> 30:07.942
<i>Don't put too much
of that on my bit.</i>

30:08.010 --> 30:11.879
<i>I can't... I can't have
too much of that.</i>

30:11.947 --> 30:13.147
<i>That's the tongue.</i>

30:13.215 --> 30:13.981
<i>The what?</i>

30:14.049 --> 30:16.384
<i>The tongue... tongue
of the goat.</i>

30:16.451 --> 30:18.019
<i>You have it.</i>
<i>No.</i>

30:18.086 --> 30:19.520
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

30:19.588 --> 30:20.821
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

30:20.889 --> 30:21.891
<i>Eat more.</i>

30:23.725 --> 30:25.393
<i>It's meat from the goat.</i>

30:25.460 --> 30:26.994
<i>What is it, though?</i>

30:27.062 --> 30:28.229
<i>That's not meat.</i>

30:28.296 --> 30:29.663
<i>This is the eye.</i>

30:29.731 --> 30:30.798
<i>I can't eat eye.</i>

30:30.866 --> 30:31.899
<i>I'll tell you now.</i>

30:31.967 --> 30:33.567
<i>I got a very bad gag reflex.</i>

30:33.635 --> 30:37.738
<i>Now, if I eat that and I start
gagging, that doesn't look good either.</i>

30:37.806 --> 30:39.306
<i>They'll think I'm rude.</i>

30:42.177 --> 30:45.279
<i>This is a weird night
out, isn't it?</i>

30:45.347 --> 30:47.926
<i>What time do we
normally go to sleep?</i>

30:49.951 --> 30:51.819
<i>Tonight we have a guest.</i>

30:51.887 --> 30:54.121
<i>So what does that mean?</i>

30:54.189 --> 30:55.681
<i>He couldn't go to sleep early.</i>

30:55.801 --> 30:57.916
<i>He can, honestly.</i>

30:59.374 --> 31:00.993
<i>I'm so tired.</i>

31:05.434 --> 31:07.401
<i>I'm shattered.</i>

31:07.469 --> 31:10.004
<i>I just want me bed.</i>
But you know,

31:10.072 --> 31:11.130
<i>What can you do?</i>

31:15.510 --> 31:17.278
<i>I'm with a family who
doesn't understand me.</i>

31:17.345 --> 31:18.312
<i>I don't understand them.</i>

31:18.380 --> 31:20.114
<i>They're cooking
food I don't like.</i>

31:20.182 --> 31:22.783
<i>It's been hard work
today, hasn't it?</i>

31:22.851 --> 31:25.965
<i>Are we actually gonna get
to Petra tomorrow or what?</i>

31:36.060 --> 31:38.829
<i>I just want to see the
wonder today, Petra.</i>

31:38.949 --> 31:39.644
<i>That's what I'm here for.</i>

31:39.764 --> 31:40.946
<i>I'm not in any mood
for messing about.</i>

31:41.066 --> 31:42.432
<i>I didn't sleep that
well last night.</i>

31:42.552 --> 31:45.135
<i>I had a rough day yesterday, 10
hours on the back of a camel in</i>

31:45.255 --> 31:46.369
<i>roasting heat.</i>

31:46.437 --> 31:47.537
<i>I've just spoke to Mohammed.</i>

31:47.605 --> 31:50.340
<i>He said we're not a quarter
of the way there yet.</i>

31:50.408 --> 31:52.209
<i>I mean, does he think I'm gonna
be getting on a camel again?</i>

31:52.276 --> 31:53.476
<i>How are we gonna get there?</i>

31:53.544 --> 31:56.079
<i>We could have drove on this
brilliantly yesterday, but we</i>

31:56.147 --> 31:57.414
<i>were on a camel instead.</i>

31:57.481 --> 31:58.415
<i>We can now drive.</i>

31:58.482 --> 32:00.417
<i>We didn't have a car, my friend.</i>

32:00.484 --> 32:01.351
<i>We have camels.</i>

32:01.419 --> 32:03.520
<i>Yeah, but they broke
down yesterday.</i>

32:03.588 --> 32:05.388
<i>Why can't we just
get in that one?</i>

32:05.456 --> 32:06.957
<i>No, we have to ride a camel.</i>

32:07.024 --> 32:08.058
<i>We don't have to.</i>

32:08.125 --> 32:10.060
<i>I don't need to get
on a camel again.</i>

32:10.127 --> 32:11.995
<i>But we aren't half the way down.</i>

32:12.063 --> 32:13.496
<i>The program's an hour long.</i>

32:13.564 --> 32:15.866
<i>We've done eight hours
of filming on a camel.</i>

32:15.933 --> 32:17.801
<i>You do the math.</i>

32:17.869 --> 32:19.369
<i>I'm not going on a
[bleep] camel again.</i>

32:19.437 --> 32:22.038
<i>I swear to God.</i>

32:22.106 --> 32:23.940
<i>We've talked about this.</i>

32:24.008 --> 32:26.243
<i>I'm bored of arguing with you.</i>

32:26.310 --> 32:29.246
<i>If you're not listening,
I'm not listening.</i>

32:29.313 --> 32:30.647
<i>I'm not going on a camel again.</i>

32:30.715 --> 32:31.281
<i>Come on.</i>

32:31.349 --> 32:32.949
<i>I'm not going on a camel again.</i>

32:33.017 --> 32:33.416
<i>Why?</i>

32:33.484 --> 32:35.085
<i>I'm not going on a camel again.</i>

32:35.152 --> 32:35.552
<i>Why?</i>

32:35.620 --> 32:37.220
<i>I'm not going on a camel again.</i>

32:37.288 --> 32:38.388
<i>I'm not going on a camel.</i>

32:38.456 --> 32:39.789
<i>I'm not going on a camel again.</i>

32:39.857 --> 32:40.290
<i>Okay.</i>

32:40.358 --> 32:44.427
<i>We could go with this car.</i>

32:44.495 --> 32:47.364
<i>So, how long will it be by car?</i>

32:47.431 --> 32:49.599
<i>A couple of hours.</i>

32:49.667 --> 32:51.534
<i>I'm just sick of camels.</i>

32:51.602 --> 32:54.871
<i>I mean, you've got to
prefer this, haven't you?</i>

32:54.939 --> 32:56.039
<i>So much nicer.</i>

32:56.107 --> 32:56.806
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:56.874 --> 32:58.608
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:58.676 --> 33:01.244
<i>I'll be in a good mood, then,
when we see Petra, and I'll go,</i>

33:01.312 --> 33:09.119
<i>"oh, wow. Amazing."</i>

33:09.186 --> 33:09.920
<i>So, we're in now.</i>

33:09.987 --> 33:11.254
<i>This is the start of it, is it?</i>

33:11.322 --> 33:13.490
<i>We are now in the beginning
of the city of Petra.</i>

33:13.557 --> 33:14.257
<i>Okay, my friend.</i>

33:14.325 --> 33:15.325
<i>I have to leave you now.</i>

33:15.393 --> 33:16.493
<i>Nice to meet you, Karl.</i>

33:16.560 --> 33:17.694
<i>I'll see you again, yeah?</i>

33:17.762 --> 33:24.768
<i>See you again, again.</i>

33:24.835 --> 33:27.737
<i>Please key in the
commentary number.</i>

33:27.805 --> 33:28.571
<i>One.</i>

33:28.639 --> 33:32.409
<i>Welcome to Petra, a city
half as old as time.</i>

33:32.476 --> 33:35.679
<i>The word "Petra" is
Latin for "rock."</i>

33:35.746 --> 33:39.849
<i>The city dates back to 300 b.
C., when it was known as...</i>

33:39.917 --> 33:41.751
<i>He just said, "welcome to Petra.
"</i>

33:41.819 --> 33:45.555
<i>He said, "'Petra' is Latin for... "</i>

33:45.623 --> 33:46.323
<i>I've forgot now.</i>

33:46.390 --> 33:47.657
<i>This is the problem with this.</i>

33:47.725 --> 33:48.792
<i>It is too much to take in.</i>

33:48.859 --> 33:50.860
<i>I mean, I didn't come
here for a Latin lesson.</i>

33:50.928 --> 33:53.496
<i>I just want to know where the
wonder is, and let's have a look</i>

33:53.564 --> 33:59.035
<i>at it.</i>

33:59.103 --> 34:01.438
<i>10.</i>

34:01.505 --> 34:04.708
<i>You are now face to face with one
of the ancient world wonders</i>

34:04.775 --> 34:06.977
<i>and the most famous
monument in Petra.</i>

34:07.044 --> 34:08.931
<i>The word in Arabic
means "treasury."</i>

34:09.051 --> 34:11.181
<i>You may recognize the facade.</i>

34:11.248 --> 34:14.751
<i>It is the site where the movie
"Indiana Jones and the last</i>

34:14.819 --> 34:19.621
<i>crusade," among
others, was filmed.</i>

34:20.958 --> 34:22.025
<i>Hang on a sec.</i>

34:22.092 --> 34:23.493
<i>Hang on.</i>

34:23.561 --> 34:24.828
<i>Hello?</i>

34:28.833 --> 34:30.699
<i>I'm just standing in
front of the wonder.</i>

34:30.768 --> 34:34.204
<i>That was a waste of time last night,
staying with the Bedouins.</i>

34:34.271 --> 34:36.606
<i>He gave me lamb's eyes to eat.</i>

34:36.674 --> 34:39.409
<i>I slept on a floor all night,
so I feel like [bleep]</i>

34:39.476 --> 34:40.677
<i>That's how I'm feeling.</i>

34:40.745 --> 34:42.145
<i>I mean, it looks all right.</i>

34:42.213 --> 34:44.848
<i>I'm sure if I was in a
better mood, I'm big it up.</i>

34:44.915 --> 34:48.018
<i>I'm basically in the middle of
a load of rock, and someone's</i>

34:48.085 --> 34:49.953
<i>carved it out, and it is amazing.</i>

34:50.021 --> 34:53.623
<i>But I don't know what more
there is to say than that.</i>

34:57.528 --> 34:58.895
<i>What for?</i>

35:02.700 --> 35:04.567
<i>What?</i>

35:12.810 --> 35:15.145
<i>Steve?</i>

35:15.212 --> 35:16.946
<i>It's Karl.</i>

35:17.014 --> 35:18.248
<i>I've just spoke to Ricky.</i>

35:18.315 --> 35:20.683
<i>He said, "oh, you're staying
in a cave tonight."</i>

35:20.751 --> 35:21.985
<i>Well, what is that about?</i>

35:22.053 --> 35:24.345
<i>'Cause I don't think he's
taking this serious.</i>

35:36.033 --> 35:37.688
<i>Yeah, but I didn't...</i>

35:40.886 --> 35:42.687
No, but I didn't literally mean

35:42.807 --> 35:43.920
<i>that's what I'd like.</i>

35:53.356 --> 36:01.148
<i>I mean, this is an all-time
low, I reckon, of me life.</i>

36:01.792 --> 36:03.526
<i>You've barely mentioned
the wonder, Karl.</i>

36:03.594 --> 36:05.195
<i>Well, I'm not thinking
about it, am I?</i>

36:05.262 --> 36:07.464
<i>How can I stand there and go,
"oh, what a beautiful bit of</i>

36:07.531 --> 36:09.666
<i>work," when in the back of me
head, you're going, "Karl,</i>

36:09.733 --> 36:11.768
<i>you're living in a cave tonight"?</i>

36:11.836 --> 36:13.837
<i>I can't focus on that.</i>

36:13.904 --> 36:16.673
<i>Oh, God.</i>

36:16.740 --> 36:19.008
<i>Steve said I got to find a
fellow called Abraham.</i>

36:19.076 --> 36:20.944
<i>He's gonna let me
stay in his cave.</i>

36:21.011 --> 36:22.879
<i>It's been a long day.</i>

36:22.947 --> 36:25.615
<i>How are you?</i>

36:25.683 --> 36:26.449
<i>How are you doing?</i>

36:26.517 --> 36:30.386
<i>So, what do you put down...
What do you put down as an address?</i>

36:30.454 --> 36:31.421
<i>Jordan, Petra.</i>

36:31.489 --> 36:32.188
<i>That's all.</i>

36:32.256 --> 36:34.157
<i>That's never gonna get to you.</i>

36:34.225 --> 36:35.658
<i>And the postman would know?</i>

36:35.726 --> 36:36.526
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

36:36.594 --> 36:37.327
<i>He knows it.</i>

36:37.394 --> 36:40.296
<i>And everything you order
always gets to your house?</i>

36:40.364 --> 36:40.897
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:40.965 --> 36:41.498
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:41.565 --> 36:43.433
<i>The cave.</i>

36:43.501 --> 36:44.434
<i>I can't believe that.</i>

36:44.502 --> 36:46.402
<i>'Cause I order stuff
and get it delivered.</i>

36:46.470 --> 36:48.838
<i>Sometimes it doesn't turn up,
and I've got a post code.</i>

36:48.906 --> 36:51.674
<i>That's amazed me more
than the wonder.</i>

36:51.742 --> 36:52.809
<i>That.</i>

36:52.877 --> 36:54.444
<i>That you can get post delivered.</i>

36:54.512 --> 36:57.480
<i>I can't believe that.</i>

36:57.548 --> 36:59.916
<i>What facilities are in the cave?</i>

36:59.984 --> 37:01.951
<i>We've got the mattress.</i>

37:02.019 --> 37:06.222
<i>We make the fire and sleep
wherever, between the sky and</i>

37:06.290 --> 37:07.190
<i>the land.</i>

37:07.258 --> 37:10.193
<i>Not like the city.</i>

37:10.261 --> 37:13.696
<i>Ricky calls and says, "you're
staying in a cave," starts</i>

37:13.764 --> 37:14.397
<i>laughing.</i>

37:14.465 --> 37:18.201
<i>And I pictured the sort of caves
you get in wales, where it's all</i>

37:18.269 --> 37:23.740
<i>sharp, sharp edges, really damp,
and the sea comes in at some</i>

37:23.807 --> 37:24.908
<i>point in the night.</i>

37:24.975 --> 37:27.710
<i>I get here, decent size.</i>

37:27.778 --> 37:30.947
<i>They're warm, they're cozy.</i>

37:31.015 --> 37:33.249
<i>Nice touch with the candles.</i>

37:33.317 --> 37:36.953
<i>I tell you, I've seen houses
that are worse than this.</i>

37:37.021 --> 37:40.857
<i>I think I can sort of fit
into this way of life.</i>

37:40.925 --> 37:43.793
<i>It is like a holiday every day.</i>

37:43.861 --> 37:45.562
<i>Nice little holiday home.</i>

37:45.629 --> 37:47.530
<i>Eating like this.</i>

37:47.598 --> 37:48.498
<i>I'm gonna drink.</i>

37:48.566 --> 37:52.669
<i>Soothes me down to
the ground, this.</i>

37:52.736 --> 37:55.305
<i>Ricky always says I'm a bit,
like, you know, a caveman, and</i>

37:55.372 --> 37:56.472
<i>I haven't really evolved.</i>

37:56.540 --> 37:59.242
<i>He says the shape of me head and
the way me eyebrows come out a</i>

37:59.310 --> 38:00.743
<i>bit.</i>

38:00.811 --> 38:01.644
<i>Maybe that's it.</i>

38:01.712 --> 38:08.851
<i>Maybe I was born a bit late.</i>

38:08.919 --> 38:11.487
<i>That's nice.</i>

38:11.555 --> 38:13.489
<i>See, we haven't all
evolved, have we?</i>

38:13.557 --> 38:14.657
<i>It's just a few of us.</i>

38:14.725 --> 38:16.559
<i>I haven't got a clue
half the time.</i>

38:16.627 --> 38:19.629
<i>I turn the tap on still, and I
go, "how is water coming out of</i>

38:19.697 --> 38:20.029
<i>that?"</i>

38:20.097 --> 38:22.432
<i>I'm lucky 'cause I'm around
'cause someone else has come up</i>

38:22.499 --> 38:22.966
<i>with that.</i>

38:23.033 --> 38:27.570
<i>But at the end of the day, if
stuff was left down to me, I'd</i>

38:27.638 --> 38:29.505
<i>still be living in here.</i>

38:29.573 --> 38:31.975
<i>If I was lucky, you know, I
don't know if I could come up with this.</i>

38:32.042 --> 38:33.509
<i>He just was saying how
they used to do it.</i>

38:33.577 --> 38:38.414
<i>He said they put a hole in the
rock, stick, like, a tree trunk</i>

38:38.482 --> 38:42.151
<i>in it, put water in,
and the wood expands.</i>

38:42.219 --> 38:44.654
<i>Is that what you were saying?</i>

38:44.722 --> 38:46.022
<i>Makes the hole bigger.</i>

38:46.090 --> 38:47.494
<i>There's no way I'd
come up with that.</i>

38:47.614 --> 38:49.574
<i>I wouldn't come up with that now.</i>

38:49.694 --> 38:52.626
<i>And yet they did that
3,500 years ago.</i>

39:04.758 --> 39:07.540
Slept all right once
I got off, really.

39:11.731 --> 39:15.167
There's a cat mooching about
now and again, wandering.

39:15.235 --> 39:21.307
That's the problem when you haven't
got a front door, isn't it?

39:21.374 --> 39:22.875
That was a good night.

39:22.942 --> 39:24.109
Best night since I've been here.

39:24.177 --> 39:24.710
Yeah.

39:24.778 --> 39:26.245
I'd do it again, you know.

39:26.313 --> 39:29.048
Being in this part of the world,
there's not many things that

39:29.115 --> 39:33.319
have happened that I'd say, "I'd
do that again," but that, I would.

39:33.386 --> 39:35.254
So, yeah, I loved it.

39:35.322 --> 39:40.993
Really, really smart.

39:41.061 --> 39:43.362
I can imagine living
at this time.

39:43.430 --> 39:47.299
I can picture meself just coming
out of a little hole just with

39:47.367 --> 39:50.803
a club and thinking, "what
am I gonna do today?"

39:50.870 --> 39:54.373
And it's easy to invent stuff back then,
'cause there was nothing else about.

39:54.441 --> 39:56.575
So, anything you needed,
you'd come up with it.

39:56.643 --> 39:57.376
I want to dry me hands.

39:57.444 --> 40:00.012
I've just washed me
hands through a towel.

40:00.080 --> 40:00.813
Everything.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.047
Anything you think of.

40:02.115 --> 40:03.349
This soup's hard to eat.

40:03.416 --> 40:04.249
I want a spoon.

40:04.317 --> 40:05.584
Do you know what I mean?

40:05.652 --> 40:07.052
You think of something now.

40:07.120 --> 40:11.457
You try and come up with
something now that you need now.

40:11.524 --> 40:12.958
Came up with a
see-through toaster.

40:13.026 --> 40:15.561
You know, 'cause you always do
that, thinking, "is it done yet?"

40:15.628 --> 40:17.763
And you have to keep pressing
the spring, and you end up

40:17.831 --> 40:19.932
breaking it 'cause you
force the spring open.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.181
See-through toaster.

40:21.301 --> 40:23.124
Went online, typed it in.

40:23.244 --> 40:24.470
It's already been invented.

40:24.537 --> 40:28.240
Dragon's den back then would
have been a piece of piss.

40:28.308 --> 40:30.376
Everybody who came in,
that's a bloody good idea.

40:30.443 --> 40:31.457
Get it made.

40:36.049 --> 40:38.984
30, Ad Deir, the monastery.

40:39.052 --> 40:44.456
Sitting at the summit of Jabal Ad Deir
is Petra's grandest monument of all, Ad Deir.

40:44.524 --> 40:47.326
The name is the Arabic
word for "monastery."

40:47.394 --> 40:50.896
Do take advantage of this
moment, and immerse yourself in

40:50.964 --> 40:54.713
the magnificence and mysticism
of this historic place.

40:58.304 --> 41:00.439
Yeah.

41:01.207 --> 41:02.708
I can't even go in it.

41:02.776 --> 41:05.077
That's ridiculous.

41:05.145 --> 41:06.578
I mean, that's useless.

41:06.646 --> 41:07.946
Who's put them there?

41:08.014 --> 41:09.134
I mean, look.

41:12.585 --> 41:17.043
The point is, you sat in there,
and that's your view over there.

41:21.428 --> 41:24.997
If you look here, point proven.

41:25.064 --> 41:29.201
You're better off living in the
hole, looking at the palace than

41:29.269 --> 41:32.704
living in the palace looking
at the hole, aren't you?

41:32.772 --> 41:35.207
So Ricky and Steve
can say I'm a nob.

41:35.275 --> 41:37.917
I think that's my point
proven, isn't it?

41:40.747 --> 41:42.668
But I wasn't just talking
about buildings.

41:42.788 --> 41:47.565
I mean, in life, even being a
good-looking person or an ugly one,

41:47.820 --> 41:49.988
in a way, you're better off
being the ugly one, and you get

41:50.056 --> 41:51.590
to look at nice things.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.560
You're looking at the
nicer-looking people.

41:54.627 --> 41:56.061
Doesn't matter about being ugly.

41:56.129 --> 41:58.096
How often do you look
at yourself anyway?

41:58.164 --> 41:59.431
Same thing.

41:59.499 --> 42:00.532
Be the ugly one.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.068
Look at the nice one.

42:07.607 --> 42:08.273
What's that?

42:08.341 --> 42:09.107
Who owns that?

42:09.175 --> 42:10.991
Why is a dog so high up?

42:15.148 --> 42:16.910
It's not gonna show up that dog, is it?

42:17.359 --> 42:20.399
Oh, fuck me. Jesus.
