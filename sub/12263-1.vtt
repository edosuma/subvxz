Come on, you little boner. Hurry your ass.

01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:39.026
Wait! Get up here!

01:01:39.026 --> 01:01:41.517
Wait up. Wait up!

01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:53.467
You bought yourself
Some time, son.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.483
Jesse, there's somethin'
I've been meanin' to ask you.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:01.975
- Yeah? What might that be?
- How old are you?

01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:04.478
Let's put it this way:
I fought for the south.

01:03:04.988 --> 01:03:07.117
The south?

01:03:10.129 --> 01:03:14.124
We lost.

01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:19.629
Hey, caleb, let's go out
And look at the night.

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:22.132
All right.

01:03:25.646 --> 01:03:29.151
How about a little five-card
Russian roulette?

01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:31.142
Why not, severen?

01:03:34.656 --> 01:03:37.649
It almost feels like
You're one of us now.

01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:39.650
Yeah, it does.

01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:43.656
So what does that make me?
I ain't exactly sure.

01:03:47.674 --> 01:03:49.665
It's good, right?
I guess so, yeah.

01:03:51.676 --> 01:03:53.678
Do you miss the sun?

01:03:53.678 --> 01:03:56.169
It's been so long,
I can't really remember.

01:03:57.683 --> 01:03:59.684
How long?

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:03.825
Spring, four years back,

01:04:03.825 --> 01:04:06.327
And i was in high school. Mmm.

01:04:06.327 --> 01:04:09.819
Homer said he was in fifth grade
And he needed help With his homework.

01:04:10.832 --> 01:04:12.822
Little weasel.

01:04:14.836 --> 01:04:17.828

And where she stops,
Nobody knows.

01:08:24.786 --> 01:08:28.279
It's about time For that big old wheel

They've been trackin' us.
Now they know our faces. I say kill 'em.

The last sound that you hear
On your way to hell...

01:24:24.443 --> 01:24:26.434
Is gonna be your guts
Snappin' like a bullwhip.

01:24:26.948 --> 01:24:29.437
This ain't got nothin'
To do with my sister!

01:24:29.951 --> 01:24:32.453
You leave her out of this
And let her go!

01:24:32.453 --> 01:24:35.445
Jesse, let him come back.

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.949
It's too late for that, Mae.

01:24:45.466 --> 01:24:47.459
Goddamn, jesse,
Where's my sister?

01:24:58.349 --> 01:25:00.351
Everything is gonna be
All right.

01:25:00.351 --> 01:25:02.353
Don't be scared.

01:25:02.353 --> 01:25:05.845
- I'm gonna take her back.
- Sure you will.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:17.634
Caleb, look out!

01:25:18.136 --> 01:25:20.502
Jess!

01:25:21.008 --> 01:25:22.998
Hey!

01:25:30.518 --> 01:25:33.009
Go, caleb.
Make a run for it.

01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:47.658
Come on, jesse!
Get in the car! Mae, come on!

01:25:51.676 --> 01:25:54.166
Hurry up!
Get in the car!

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.828
Go on! Aah!

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:22.335
Go on, honey. Go on. Run.
Run, sarah!

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.701
No!

01:26:43.701 --> 01:26:47.694
No!

01:26:58.552 --> 01:27:01.042
Block that sun out!

01:27:26.182 --> 01:27:28.685
No!

01:27:28.685 --> 01:27:31.451
Mae!

01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:38.096
- - no, homer!

01:27:51.112 --> 01:27:52.601
No!

01:28:05.129 --> 01:28:07.119
Caleb!

01:28:09.131 --> 01:28:10.863
Wait, sarah!

01:28:18.142 --> 01:28:20.134
My god.

01:28:22.647 --> 01:28:24.638
Jesse.

01:28:58.922 --> 01:29:00.411
Roast.

01:29:00.924 --> 01:29:02.414
Fun times.

01:30:07.699 --> 01:30:10.190
Caleb, what's happening?

01:30:12.339 --> 01:30:13.830
I brought you home.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:22.350
I'm afraid. Don't be.

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.340
It's just the sun.
