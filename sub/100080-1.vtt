WEBVTT

00:07.137 --> 00:08.878
Previously onSWAT...I was always closer to my pop

00:08.921 --> 00:11.272
than I was my mom.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.404
But when he left
and disappeared on my mom

00:13.448 --> 00:15.189
just with no warning, I... Your doctors say

00:15.232 --> 00:17.887
you can't live alone, and your
family's not here; we're in L.A.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.889
Pack your things, 'cause we are leaving here as a family.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.239
LUCA:
I got this new house
in East Hollywood.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.501
I'm still fixing it up.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.025
We gonna bunk together
again or what, man?

00:25.068 --> 00:26.678
This is part of the city program
for cops.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.332
I figure we start right here
and get this ready

00:28.376 --> 00:29.681
for the flat-screen TV.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.335
I'm Molly.
Jim Street.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.511
Don't make me have to get
involved in your love life.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.035
You have way too much
fun at these things.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.037
Maybe I enjoy having
my daughter here.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.690
Are you trying to
poach me from SWAT?

00:38.734 --> 00:40.170
BENSON:
You need to be
out in the field.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.737
I'm gonna take the FBI up
on their offer

00:41.780 --> 00:42.868
and do the five weeks.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.957
Just five weeks, huh?
Well...

00:45.001 --> 00:47.351
Leroy, I know
he's your son,

00:47.395 --> 00:48.613
and I am not his father.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.354
But me and my moms are gonna be

00:50.398 --> 00:51.529
looking after him now,
full time.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.922
CHARICE:
Something happened to Darryl.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.184
The boy was shot.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.490
DOCTOR:
He'll be able to walk,

00:55.533 --> 00:56.708
but he'll never have
full functionality.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.710
LEROY:
Show him what's possible.

00:58.754 --> 01:00.364
Show him what he ain't seen.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.323
I thought maybe you and I could
do some traveling this summer.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.021
Where do you want to go?I mean, I never seen
a kangaroo before.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.457
Me neither.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.731
NVGs down.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.630
Yeah!

01:48.673 --> 01:51.198
17.5. Hell yes!Yeah!

01:51.241 --> 01:53.156
That's a second faster
than 50 Squad.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.332
That's a new LAPD record.Good job, guys.

01:55.376 --> 01:56.507
You're gonna make Hondo
jealous, Deac,

01:56.551 --> 01:58.030
setting a new mark
on the day he gets back.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.641
I'm sure he'll be
more proud than jealous.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.338
We'll find out soon enough.
The plane landed an hour ago.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.731
All right, that gives us time
to set it up,

02:02.774 --> 02:04.254
run it back a few more times.
Let's go.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.256
Let's do it.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.650
I don't know about you, kid,
but I'm about to start

02:08.693 --> 02:11.174
scouring this city
for a good flat white coffee.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.654
Nah, man, it's all about
those meat pies.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.699
Ooh, they were good,
I'll give you that. [chuckles]

02:16.266 --> 02:18.573
Hey, D, wait, wai-wai-wait.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.357
Door's already unlocked.

02:20.401 --> 02:23.186
Get down, get down, right there.
Under the window. Now.

02:23.230 --> 02:24.448
Don't move.

02:25.928 --> 02:29.018
This is LAPD.
Identify yourself!

02:29.061 --> 02:30.498
This is
Sergeant Daniel Harrelson.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.456
I am armed, and you are
on my property.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.371
DANIEL:
Yeah, well,
it was my property

02:34.415 --> 02:37.200
way back before
it was yours.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.292
Pop, why didn't you
answer me, man?

02:42.336 --> 02:45.252
I was napping.
Welcome home, son.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.952
Darryl, come on, kid, it's cool.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.348
Come on.

02:54.391 --> 02:57.481
Hey.
You remember my pops,
Daniel Senior.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.830
Nice to see you again, sir.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.092
It's good to see you, too.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.355
How was Australia?

03:01.398 --> 03:02.617
Oh, it was pretty great.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.053
It was like pressing
the reset button, Pops.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.402
Coming home chill as a fridge.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.012
Good.
Now talk to me.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.362
Why are you napping here?

03:08.405 --> 03:09.885
Ah, your sister Brianna.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.496
Got this new man
staying there all the time.

03:12.540 --> 03:16.500
Pawing and laughing
like they invented romance.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.894
My sister's
a grown woman, Pop.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.287
She's allowed to have
a boyfriend at the house.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.202
That don't mean I need
courtside seats.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.249
How long you been
staying here?About three weeks.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
Hoping to stay
a little bit longer,

03:27.816 --> 03:29.339
you know, just till
I get my own place.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.254
Okay, you know what, that's
a whole nother conversation,

03:31.298 --> 03:33.822
and we're gonna have it
when I get home.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.216
Of course. I'm sure
the young man and I

03:36.259 --> 03:37.565
can get by without you.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.610
Pop, don't go filling
the kid's head with a bunch

03:39.654 --> 03:40.959
of your crazy stories
while I'm gone.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.657
Yeah, you.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.528
And you, don't believe
a word he says.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.878
[chuckling]

03:46.922 --> 03:49.272
I'm telling you guys,
every single dating app

03:49.316 --> 03:50.926
gone... no mÃ¡s.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.668
Bumble? Hinge? That one was
a gold mine for you.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.104
The kid ain't lying, man,
I watched him do it.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.540
No, no, I'm looking
for something more.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.064
I'm not gonna find it
swiping right, that's for sure.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.283
I thought that's
the only way

04:00.327 --> 04:01.458
your generation meets
people these days.

04:01.502 --> 04:04.244
I figure I focus
on me a little, the job.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.420
I got my eye on a new
Cadre Certification.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.161
If the right woman's out there,
it'll happen, right?

04:09.205 --> 04:10.511
Hasn't happened for Hondo
or Luca yet.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.643
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Foul on the play, Chris.
Oh!

04:12.687 --> 04:14.210
Damn.I'm just biding my time.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.603
In other news, the
Eagle has landed.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.213
The boss is back.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.475
Oh, man, I miss that guy.TAN:
Nice.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.955
[imitating Hondo]:
Now listen up, people.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.523
Just 'cause I've been on
vacation don't mean I went soft.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.351
[laughter]That's all right, it's a
little Hondo, a little Elvis.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.569
Yeah, yeah, hey.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.962
You forgot the football grab
on the vest.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.050
And the gloves.Oh, yeah.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.443
Lot that makes Hondo
the man he is.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.922
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's make this interesting.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.576
Everybody pick their
favorite Hondo thing,

04:32.620 --> 04:33.838
and if he says it or does it,

04:33.882 --> 04:35.840
you're safe.
Anyone left standing

04:35.884 --> 04:37.364
has to buy the food and drink
for Luca's house tonight.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.496
I'll take, uh,
"Now, listen up, people."Football grab.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.324
Whoa, that was mine, man.We weren't playing yet.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.804
I'll take, uh, "stay liquid."

04:42.847 --> 04:45.023
You can't take "stay liquid."
That's 20 Squad tradition.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.461
He still says it.I got fist bump.
I miss that.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.159
Y'all took the good ones.
All right, all right.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.856
You better pick something.
He's gonna get here real quick.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.336
No, I just did.
"All right, all right."

04:53.380 --> 04:54.729
Does he say that?Sometimes.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.600
You stole my football grab.You snooze, you lose.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.819
All right, all right.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.821
Ah!20 David back
in the building!

04:59.864 --> 05:02.171
Yeah, boss, we missed you.What's up, Luca?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.347
Hey, come here, Chris.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.610
Big Tan. Street!

05:06.654 --> 05:07.698
Yo, yo, yo!

05:07.742 --> 05:08.917
Yeah.Welcome back.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.135
Deacon, give me some.
Give me some.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.398
[laughing]

05:11.441 --> 05:13.008
I know you been holding it down,
right, Deac?

05:13.051 --> 05:14.357
Now wait a minute.
Did y'all really beat

05:14.401 --> 05:15.663
the dark room target
record this morning?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.839
By one second.That's what I'm talking about.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.189
Oh, Luca, I heard about
your fall. How you feeling?

05:20.232 --> 05:21.364
Rehab's rolling along.
I'll be all right.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.844
We got our guy, though.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.193
Yeah, and he would've done it
without busting a hip

05:24.236 --> 05:25.673
if that balcony had been
up to code.

05:25.716 --> 05:26.674
I still get to roll with y'all,
I just have to hang back

05:26.717 --> 05:28.197
when you guys breach,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.938
until they clear me
for full duty.That's cool.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.767
All right, well, listen. I got
a call from Captain Cortez.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.682
Sounds like she's gonna stick
with that Fed gig.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.510
CHRIS:
I knew she'd love
undercover.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.686
Just... always thought
she'd be back.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.948
HONDO:
Well, let's see
what happens.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.254
But in the meantime,
I hear we got a bad man

05:42.298 --> 05:43.908
to bring in this
morning, huh?
LUCA:
Yeah, we sure do.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.563
His name's Wade Coleson,
he's a burglar to the stars.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.956
Dude stole, like, $8 million

05:47.999 --> 05:50.393
in jewelry from celebrity
mansions this year alone.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.655
He collects semi-automatics
on the side.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.396
Robbery-homicide asked us
to take lead.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
Roger that.
Let's go get him.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.225
Yeah.
Tac up!

05:56.268 --> 05:58.009
20-David!
[whoops]

05:58.053 --> 05:59.010
MOLLY:
It's a simple favor, Dad.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.491
Listen, as much as I'd love to,

06:01.535 --> 06:03.667
I can't just loan out
Metro officers

06:03.711 --> 06:04.842
to help my daughter on her job.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.757
Well, they wouldn't
be helping me,

06:06.801 --> 06:07.976
they'd be helping the
victim of a crime.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.717
What you're doing
for the women's shelter,

06:09.760 --> 06:10.761
I think it's great.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.328
I'm proud of you.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.025
But I can't supply manpower.

06:14.069 --> 06:17.812
Okay. I get it.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.770
I'm sorry.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.163
We're still on
for dinner, right?

06:22.207 --> 06:24.558
Of course.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.821
I'll drop by after work.

06:32.261 --> 06:35.220
Hey, top of the
morning, Ms. Hicks.Hey, Jim.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.700
Everything okay?

06:36.744 --> 06:39.573
Uh... not your problem.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.966
And you look like you have
some doors to kick in.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.490
Not for a few minutes.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.230
Hey, would you mind taking that
to the motor pool?

06:45.274 --> 06:47.276
Yeah.
Thanks, man.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.756
What's up?

06:48.799 --> 06:51.193
[sighs] Well, I moved back here
to work at this law firm

06:51.236 --> 06:53.195
that does pro bono work at
a battered women's shelter.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.675
That sounds
pretty intense.Yeah.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.980
There are some pretty
messed-up men out there,

06:56.024 --> 06:57.242
as I'm sure you know.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.636
Yeah, I've seen a
few in my day.Anyway,

06:59.680 --> 07:02.422
a woman came in today,
finally worked up the courage

07:02.465 --> 07:04.902
to leave the creep who's been
beating her for years.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.426
She's ready to move out
for good, but she's too scared

07:06.469 --> 07:07.862
to go back and
get her things.

07:07.905 --> 07:10.386
The shelter doesn't provide
officers to escort her?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.996
They do, but
patrol is swamped,

07:12.040 --> 07:13.084
and the shelter can't
provide someone

07:13.128 --> 07:14.434
until next week.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.000
And I'm worried she'll
lose her nerve by then.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.088
So you came here hoping your dad

07:17.132 --> 07:18.525
could get you someone
to help out?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.004
Yeah, but he's a stickler
for protocol, so...

07:20.048 --> 07:22.790
Well, just because the boss
can't assign someone

07:22.833 --> 07:24.661
doesn't mean an officer
can't volunteer.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.055
I got to go
and serve this warrant,

07:27.098 --> 07:28.360
but I can make some time
this afternoon.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.842
You sure?Yeah. Absolutely.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.671
It's for a good cause, right?

07:34.715 --> 07:36.238
It is.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.332
In position covering
topside egress.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.551
HONDO:
Roger that.

07:44.594 --> 07:47.031
Entry team in position.
Ready to breach.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.163
Luca, are we clear?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.730
Front side secure.Roger that.

07:51.862 --> 07:54.865
Breach on my count,
in three, two...TAN: Hold.

07:54.909 --> 07:58.739
Incoming surveillance drone.
Guy might have eyes in the sky.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.092
All clear. False alarm.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.925
âª If you're feelin' how I'm
feelin', then put your twos up âª

08:10.968 --> 08:12.448
âª If you feel âª Yeahâª

08:12.492 --> 08:13.536
âª How I feel âª Yeahâª

08:13.580 --> 08:15.103
âª If you feel âª Whatâª

08:15.146 --> 08:16.147
âª How I feel âª Uh-huhâª

08:16.191 --> 08:18.410
âª If you feel how I feel

08:18.454 --> 08:20.412
âª Put your twos up

08:20.456 --> 08:22.719
âª I wanna kick it now,
so let me bring it down... âª

08:22.763 --> 08:24.547
I hate those things.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.070
âª And we can fizzle out

08:26.114 --> 08:29.160
âª And we're jumpin'
in the sea... âª

08:29.204 --> 08:30.205
Honey, this thing's...

08:31.772 --> 08:33.121
[screaming]

08:33.164 --> 08:34.905
Hold the breach.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.870
Hey, guys,
something just happened.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.611
Some kind of explosion
on the beach.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.003
HONDO:
Pull out. Everyone pull out.

08:48.179 --> 08:51.661
DISPATCHER:
All units be advised,
explosion north of the marina.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.142
Multiple casualties.
Cause unknown.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.276
[siren chirps, tires squeal]

09:00.191 --> 09:02.324
LUCA:
Keep it moving, come on!

09:02.367 --> 09:03.760
Let's go, move, move, move!Let's go!

09:03.804 --> 09:06.154
Keep your eyes peeled
for any further threats.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.851
Let's go!

09:07.895 --> 09:09.200
I got you.Keep moving! Come on!

09:09.244 --> 09:12.203
[panicked chatter, yelling]

09:12.247 --> 09:13.335
Come on, come on, keep moving!

09:13.378 --> 09:14.554
Let's go, move!

09:14.597 --> 09:15.555
This way,
this way, this way.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.600
Hurry up!

09:17.644 --> 09:18.514
Oh, my God!

09:18.558 --> 09:19.907
[panicked chatter]

09:19.950 --> 09:22.213
Luca! First aid kits!Got it!

09:25.347 --> 09:27.349
âª

10:00.730 --> 10:03.472
[sirens wailing, helicopter
blades whirring]

10:05.692 --> 10:09.870
âª

10:09.913 --> 10:11.480
MAN: Was just another drone
on the beach.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.482
Figured it was some perv
trying to get bikini shots.

10:13.525 --> 10:14.570
All right,
we appreciate your time.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.572
EMTs will get to you soon.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.840
I need the ranking officer.I'm Sergeant Harrelson.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.276
SWAT.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.191
Lieutenant Detective
Piper Lynch, Hollywood Division.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.063
You're a little far
west, aren't you?
Yeah, a lot

10:29.106 --> 10:30.978
of agencies gonna be sticking
their fingers in this--

10:31.021 --> 10:32.414
FBI, FAA, Homeland.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.242
The mayor has asked me
to personally run point

10:34.285 --> 10:36.331
between the departments and make
sure that we don't cross streams

10:36.374 --> 10:38.246
with the Feds.
So...

10:38.289 --> 10:40.596
what do we know?Some sort of drone
strapped with explosives.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.946
Six dead, a dozen more wounded.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.644
Still IDing the victims.

10:44.687 --> 10:47.211
Anything left of the aircraft?Just melted fragments.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.039
Nothing traceable.TAN: Lieutenant Lynch?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.824
Long time.Victor Tan.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.696
Look at you, all gussied up
in SWAT gear. Fits you well.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.219
Lynch is a legend
in Hollywood Division.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.394
Her deep cover op set the bar

10:56.438 --> 10:57.569
back when I
was on Vice.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.788
Yeah, let's save the flattery.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.398
Any witnesses get
a look at the drone?

11:00.442 --> 11:01.748
Actually,
I think I did.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.575
I was covering
a roof egress a mile east

11:03.619 --> 11:04.881
when I clocked one
heading this way

11:04.925 --> 11:06.578
maybe a minute
before the explosion.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.711
Had something strapped to it.
I figured it was a camera,

11:08.755 --> 11:09.886
but could've been explosives.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.105
Maybe I should've
sensed something.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.672
No, it would've been
too late anyhow.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.630
Based on the aircraft's flight
path and projected range,

11:14.674 --> 11:15.979
we have patrol
canvassing the area

11:16.023 --> 11:17.241
we suspect the pilot
was working from.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.634
He may have left
something behind.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.418
Be nice to know more
about the drone itself.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.594
You mind if I send these two to
talk to someone who might help?

11:22.638 --> 11:23.944
Need all the intel we can get.

11:35.172 --> 11:36.565
You Walter?

11:36.608 --> 11:38.610
Yeah. What can
I do for you?

11:38.654 --> 11:40.221
What, are you building
the next Terminator?

11:40.264 --> 11:42.223
Nah, Rocco's a lover,
not a fighter.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.442
One of you guys got
a look at the drone?Yeah, think so.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.618
I was on the rooftop
of a high-rise.Yeah, yeah. Lynch told me.

11:46.662 --> 11:49.447
Anyhow, I pulled up views
of a dozen drone models

11:49.491 --> 11:50.622
with the range
and payload needed

11:50.666 --> 11:52.059
to pull something like this off.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.451
Hopefully,
one of them looks familiar.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.410
So how do you and Lieutenant
Lynch know each other?

11:55.453 --> 11:58.413
I'm good at what I do.
She collects people like me.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.457
TAN:
This one, for sure.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.416
Ah, figures.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.852
There were about
three million drones

12:02.896 --> 12:04.332
purchased in the U.S. last year,

12:04.375 --> 12:06.334
and that was a top seller.
Cheap, reliable,

12:06.377 --> 12:09.076
got a range of two miles,
can carry three to four pounds.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.034
Could go further and carry
more weight if modified.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.819
So whoever's operating it
would have to have been near us.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.255
Yep.TAN: I'm guessing
there's quite

12:14.298 --> 12:15.647
a few places in the city
that sell 'em?

12:15.691 --> 12:16.910
I'd love to tell you
this guy was using

12:16.953 --> 12:18.476
some cutting-edge tech,
but he didn't,

12:18.520 --> 12:19.826
which is terrifying.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.566
I hope to God you catch him,
but unless you get

12:21.610 --> 12:24.091
a serial number, the drone he
used ain't gonna help you do it.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.180
I'm sorry.
You guys need a lift

12:26.223 --> 12:28.530
back to the station?[engine starts]

12:29.879 --> 12:31.098
[chuckles]

12:31.141 --> 12:32.926
You drive a Porsche
with your iPad?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.405
Can rig it to anything.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.755
Just waiting on
the go-ahead from Uber

12:35.798 --> 12:37.191
so I can get rich from my couch.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.801
Ah, I think we'll
keep it old-school.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.499
Thanks, though.

12:41.543 --> 12:42.936
[engine revs]

12:46.461 --> 12:50.030
HICKS:
Lieutenant Lynch.
I hear good things.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.248
Likewise, Commander.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.076
So, where are we at?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.251
The victims include
a schoolteacher,

12:54.295 --> 12:55.470
an engineer and her husband,

12:55.513 --> 12:56.906
two fast-food
workers, and a nurse.

12:56.950 --> 12:57.994
LYNCH:
FBI's running backgrounds,

12:58.038 --> 13:00.083
but so far nothing links them.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.519
Homeland pick up
any Web chatter?

13:01.563 --> 13:02.825
Not a peep.No, and it's the type of thing

13:02.869 --> 13:04.218
that a terrorist cell
would brag about.

13:04.261 --> 13:05.785
So, what do we know
about the explosives?

13:05.828 --> 13:07.395
It's homemade C-4,
about three pounds.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.744
HICKS:
That means the weapons
are untraceable,

13:08.788 --> 13:10.093
we have no idea who made 'em,

13:10.137 --> 13:12.052
how many they have,
or what their motive is.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.793
There's a temporary ban
on all drones and the FAA's got

13:13.836 --> 13:15.577
all available eyes
scanning the sky.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.274
Those things are two feet
wide and fly under the radar.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.623
You can stare at
their screen all day,

13:18.667 --> 13:20.277
it does not guarantee success.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.106
FBI, Homeland, NSA, every
agency's all in on this.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.891
They'll find something.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.240
And the second they do,
the mayor needs SWAT

13:26.283 --> 13:27.458
ready to pounce.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.245
What's with the uniform, kid?

13:31.288 --> 13:32.986
Well, since we're
holding till the Feds

13:33.029 --> 13:35.379
get a lead we can run with,
I figure I'd pop out,

13:35.423 --> 13:37.033
help Molly Hicks with
something at her job.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.079
You're kissing up to the boss's
daughter now, Street?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.994
Come on, man.No, it's nothing like that.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.257
It's a domestic victim
in need of support.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.259
Just keep your
phone close, playboy.

13:45.302 --> 13:46.869
I'll be ready to roll.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.523
Sis.
BRIANNA:
Hey.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.090
What's up?
Hey, you.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.787
Thanks for coming in.
Oh.
[scoffs]

13:51.831 --> 13:53.528
No way I'd miss your face
for this conversation.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.530
Hmm. So Pops tells me

13:55.573 --> 13:57.227
you have a new little
boyfriend at the house, huh?

13:57.271 --> 13:59.055
That all he said?
[chuckles]

13:59.099 --> 14:01.492
He didn't tell you how he won't
leave my poor man alone,

14:01.536 --> 14:03.233
grilling him like he's my prom
date or some madness.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.235
Ah, I can only imagine.
Did you talk to him?

14:05.279 --> 14:06.976
Try to get him to
back off a little bit?

14:07.020 --> 14:10.806
Was fixing to, and then he just
up and relocated to your place.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.634
Sounds like a win-win
all around.No, no, no, hold on.

14:12.677 --> 14:15.289
Hold on. Will you at least tell
him that he's still welcome?

14:15.332 --> 14:17.421
Look, Cal and I
are getting serious.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.728
Now, if Dad is uncomfortable
with that, that's on him.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.383
I have been looking after him
for over a year now, by the way.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.428
I know, and I appreciate
it, but come on, Brie.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.908
Your moms is over
300 miles away

14:25.952 --> 14:27.388
and she doesn't want
his head on a plate.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.564
My mom lives here, and
trust me, she does.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.479
Charice is still
that sour on him?

14:31.522 --> 14:34.308
She's in Palm Springs until
Sunday, but if my pops is still

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
at the house when she gets
back, it ain't gonna be pretty.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.225
[chuckles] At least you have
some peace untilSunday.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.923
But then I got Darryl.Wait, what about Darryl?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.533
He afraid of old men?

14:42.577 --> 14:45.362
We just got back from
clearing our heads, Brie.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.582
I want to start fresh.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.192
I want to create
a stable environment,

14:49.236 --> 14:50.585
but, come on, you know Pops.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.021
He's not exactly reliable.

14:52.065 --> 14:55.677
Hmm. Last I checked,
that house had three bedrooms.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.287
Not like they'll be
bunking together.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.202
Now, I know your hands
are full with Darryl,

14:59.246 --> 15:01.378
but maybe it'll be easier
with two people.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.685
You know, like-like pets.[scoffs]

15:03.728 --> 15:05.034
You just call Daddy a pet?

15:05.078 --> 15:06.731
You know what I mean.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.777
I can see this
being a good thing.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.781
GREG:
She the one who put you
up to this?

15:15.044 --> 15:16.393
Like she knows
what's best for you?

15:16.437 --> 15:18.134
Pretend he's not here.I mean,
if you were better

15:18.178 --> 15:19.919
at making decisions,
we wouldn't be in this mess,

15:19.962 --> 15:21.921
now, would we?STREET:
Hey, buddy.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.053
Why don't we just let her
pack her things in peace, okay?

15:24.097 --> 15:26.534
My pleasure. It'd be a relief
not having her crap

15:26.577 --> 15:28.666
clutter up the place.Hey. What'd I just say?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.581
It's called teasing. Relax.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.366
No, it's called shaming.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.498
And now you're minimizing
to cover it up.

15:34.542 --> 15:38.154
I'm what? It's not my fault
she can't take a joke.

15:38.198 --> 15:39.634
STREET:
And that's blaming the victim.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.897
You want to keep going?
Maybe rationalize your behavior,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.986
play the guilt game?If you weren't

15:44.030 --> 15:46.467
wearing a badge...I'd still kick your ass,
so shut it down, big man.

15:46.510 --> 15:49.731
How about we all just
take it easy, okay?

15:49.774 --> 15:51.080
Iris, go ahead
and pack your things.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.214
No. No,
the stallion is mine.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.477
You gave it to me.No. When I bought it,

15:56.520 --> 15:57.913
I said that...That's far enough.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.393
You're in my house.
I'm talking to my girlfriend.

15:59.436 --> 16:00.872
I'm gonna need you
to back it up.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.052
[grunting]

16:06.095 --> 16:07.923
Keep your mouth shut.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.838
This ends here.
One more word,

16:09.881 --> 16:12.319
I book you for assaulting
an officer. Understand?

16:12.362 --> 16:14.060
Iris, take your time.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.193
Don't hurt him, okay?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.891
Why don't you go get
your things from the bedroom?

16:19.935 --> 16:21.545
It's okay.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.939
STREET:
Stay.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.333
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.552
My dad always said this was

16:28.596 --> 16:29.945
the most frustrating part
of the job.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.079
Get called to the same
house over and over.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.081
Most times the woman stays.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.126
Yeah, it's harder to leave
than you'd think.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.041
Well, you know a thing or two
about it?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.478
Eh, my dad was a piece of work.

16:41.522 --> 16:42.740
Then how'd you turn out so good?

16:42.784 --> 16:43.915
[chuckles]:
Me?

16:43.959 --> 16:45.787
I don't know. Did I?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.094
I'm a work in progress.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.574
IRIS:
That's everything.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.272
Okay, let's get going, then.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.449
Come around this way.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.279
You can get up
in a minute.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.803
[phone beeping]

17:03.022 --> 17:05.198
There's been another bombing.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.026
How bad is it?This one hit Downtown.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.636
Five dead, eight wounded.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.247
The Feds found a drone fragment
with partial serial number.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.075
They're running it
through their crime lab now.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.816
Is this a victim or suspect?Survivor.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.209
Caught the blast on camera.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.384
CHICO V [over video]:
What up, peeps?

17:17.427 --> 17:18.950
This is your boy Chico V.

17:18.994 --> 17:21.040
I'm here in Downtown
in the City of Angels,

17:21.083 --> 17:22.867
and zayum, this spot is lit.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.739
We getting ready
to drop some stacks.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.958
I'm talking...[people screaming]

17:27.002 --> 17:29.439
Homeland still hasn't linked the
attacks to any terrorist cell,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.050
so at this point
we have to assume

17:31.093 --> 17:32.921
they're gonna keep coming
until we stop 'em.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.184
LYNCH:
Good news. Feds got a hit
on the serial number.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.926
The aircraft used was purchased
along with three others

17:37.969 --> 17:41.147
at Eli's Electronics
in Simi Valley three weeks ago.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.148
They pulled an image
of the buyer

17:42.191 --> 17:43.149
off the store security cam.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.933
Put it up.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.891
LUCA:
With security cameras,

17:46.935 --> 17:48.241
you think he'd try
to hide his face.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.851
DEACON:
Maybe that's not our guy.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.548
What if our perp paid a homeless
guy to make the purchase?

17:51.592 --> 17:53.246
Keeps his face off-camera.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.117
I spent a year undercover
on the Skid Row task force.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.336
If our man in the photo

17:56.379 --> 17:57.902
is part of L.A.'s
homeless, I have a guy

17:57.946 --> 18:00.166
over in Central Division
who will know him.
How?

18:00.209 --> 18:03.169
There's over 30,000 homeless
in this city.
Yep.

18:03.212 --> 18:06.085
And the average human can
only put 150 names to faces,

18:06.128 --> 18:08.217
but I pride myself on
knowing exceptional people

18:08.261 --> 18:10.393
and using their talents
whenever possible.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.221
Mick? It's Piper.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.918
I'm gonna text you a photo.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.096
[sighs]
Really?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.706
[sighs]
Fine.

18:18.749 --> 18:20.490
[high-pitched]:
Hey, pal. How are you?

18:20.534 --> 18:21.883
It has been way too long.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.711
Listen, I need a favor.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.017
[regular pitch]:
Better?

18:26.061 --> 18:28.933
Great. Texting the photo.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.762
Check your phone.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.507
Are you sure? Good.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.509
Drone buyer goes by Brewster.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.381
Now, my guy hasn't seen him
in the last few weeks,

18:41.424 --> 18:43.165
but he says-- damn it,
I forgot to say goodbye.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.775
Anyway, he
says Brewster

18:44.819 --> 18:47.561
usually holes up in an alley
off of Crocker Street downtown.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.563
All right.
I'll run it down myself.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.608
[siren wailing]

18:52.957 --> 18:54.872
I almost had Hondo
with a fist bump.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.396
He didn't bite.And he would've said

18:56.439 --> 18:58.049
"stay liquid" back at
the raid this morning

18:58.093 --> 19:00.400
if we hadn't gotten
pulled. On the upside,

19:00.443 --> 19:02.793
we're looking at a four-way
split for burgers and beers.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.055
Brewster?

19:04.099 --> 19:06.232
BREWSTER:
Who's asking?LAPD.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.972
You mind stepping out
for a sec?

19:08.016 --> 19:10.279
Nah, I'm good. I'm
just eating my lunch.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.412
You're not in trouble,
Brewster, though, technically,

19:12.455 --> 19:15.241
you're not allowed to camp
in an active alley.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.981
But if you give us a sec,
we won't bounce you.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.853
Okay.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.463
I'm coming out.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.293
[grunting]

19:25.251 --> 19:27.078
DEACON:
Whoa.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.168
Fortune's been
smiling down on you, huh?

19:29.211 --> 19:30.386
[chuckles]: Why I got the
feeling that's about to change?

19:30.430 --> 19:31.822
We just want to
know who was it

19:31.866 --> 19:33.694
that paid you to buy
those drones up in Simi Valley.

19:33.737 --> 19:36.305
[sighs] I knew this was gonna
come back to bite me in the ass.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.089
I got no idea who that guy was.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.221
CHRIS:
Physical description?

19:39.265 --> 19:40.483
Car he drove?

19:40.527 --> 19:41.919
Uh, he was
a white guy.

19:41.963 --> 19:45.140
20s or 30s, kind of average, uh,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.273
wore sunglasses and a ball cap.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.058
He drove a Camry
or a Corolla or something.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.103
And, uh,
he didn't talk much,

19:52.147 --> 19:54.410
except to say
that if we spent less money

19:54.454 --> 19:56.934
overseas killing people,
we might be able to afford

19:56.978 --> 19:59.110
to house the ones on the streets
back here at home.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.851
Kind of see
his point on that.

20:00.895 --> 20:03.027
This thing sounds political.Why? What'd he do?

20:03.071 --> 20:04.638
He killed 11 people,
and without your help,

20:04.681 --> 20:05.943
he might kill
a lot more.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.510
This guy's got
the whole city terrified.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.164
Damn, now,
I-I don't know what to say.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.079
He gave me five bills
to make the buy.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.515
Did you go anywhere else?No, I just drove

20:12.559 --> 20:14.691
out to Simi, got the drones,
and then came back here.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.519
You didn't stop
for food, gas, anything?

20:16.563 --> 20:17.955
Nope.All right.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.043
We're gonna have to take you
down to the station,

20:19.087 --> 20:20.044
work with a sketch artist.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.003
[stammers]

20:22.046 --> 20:24.005
You know what,
actually we did stop.

20:24.048 --> 20:26.007
Starbucks drive-through.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.748
I needed coffee.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.880
Got one of them fancy drinks.

20:29.924 --> 20:31.621
HICKS:
Car was rented
for cash,

20:31.665 --> 20:33.057
but the driver had
to use a credit card

20:33.101 --> 20:35.016
for a security deposit.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.061
LYNCH:
Nate Westerly.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.716
26-year-old L.A. native
and army vet

20:39.760 --> 20:41.675
with a dishonorable discharge.

20:41.718 --> 20:42.937
HICKS:
Renting a half an acre

20:42.980 --> 20:44.286
in Conejo Valley.
Private, secluded.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.332
Pushing the warrant
through now.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.985
All right, great.
Send me the intel.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.422
I'll round up my team.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.605
DEACON [over radio]:
In position. Two side, set.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.737
Roger that. Four side, set.

21:00.781 --> 21:01.999
Luca, do you have a visual?

21:02.043 --> 21:03.436
LUCA:
Tactical robot sweeping.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.308
No sign of threats.
Clear to breach.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.183
DEACON:
Left side clear.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.752
Right side clear.TAN: All clear.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.322
He bought four drones,
but he's only used two.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.455
And looking at this setup,
he's sitting on a lot more C-4.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.934
Looks like he bought
extra battery power

21:23.978 --> 21:25.588
and signal
boosters, too.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.287
He's trying to extend the flying
time and range. That's not good.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.245
He could still be on the
property sweeping the area now.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.469
[buzzing overhead]

21:51.788 --> 21:53.616
No explosives.
It's just a lookout.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.531
But now he knows
we're on to him.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.451
Feds sent over their file
on Westerly.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.932
The more we learn about
this guy, the more he scares me.

22:04.975 --> 22:06.499
Four years in the army

22:06.542 --> 22:08.022
and two tours in Yemen before
he starts getting written up

22:08.065 --> 22:09.415
for insubordination.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.938
Army finally
gives him the boot,

22:10.981 --> 22:13.288
he starts taking classes
at community college.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.681
Guess what
he studied.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.509
Arabic and
modern Islam.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.512
So he got radicalized?
Any ties to known cells?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.514
Not in the file,
but he's been active protesting

22:21.557 --> 22:22.950
U.S. drone strikes,

22:22.993 --> 22:25.474
and we finally got backgrounds
on all the victims.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.216
Tim Miller, died in
the second bombing.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.044
He used to pilot unmanned
aircraft over Yemen.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.698
LYNCH:
And the engineer
killed on the beach

22:31.741 --> 22:33.395
designed the model
the pilot flew.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.266
So these attacks,
they're assassinations?

22:35.310 --> 22:37.181
Yeah, but just like
military drone strikes,

22:37.225 --> 22:38.661
they come with
collateral damage.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.184
This guy's trying
to send a message.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.056
Yeah, about civilian
casualties.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.188
We found his letters to Congress
asking why American lives

22:44.232 --> 22:45.494
are worth more
than foreign ones.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.148
DEACON:
American lives
aren't worth more,

22:47.191 --> 22:49.193
they're just the ones that the
military is sworn to protect.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.369
This guy's off his nut.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.240
Westerly's I.P. history
had a blueprint

22:52.283 --> 22:53.459
of the factory that builds

22:53.502 --> 22:55.852
military UAVs,
including this model,

22:55.896 --> 22:57.071
designed
by the engineer

22:57.114 --> 22:58.681
and flown by the pilot
killed in the attacks.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.814
That's the Lockman Aeronautics
plant. That's out in Palmdale.

23:00.857 --> 23:02.946
And if Westerly's upgraded
his range and payload

23:02.990 --> 23:05.427
for his next drone, this could
be the deadliest attack yet.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.386
FBI and Homeland
are securing the site

23:07.429 --> 23:09.605
to see that doesn't happen,
but there's something else.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.433
Westerly had
three years

23:11.477 --> 23:13.870
worth of e-mails with an
L.A.-based immigration lawyer.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.655
What, you think
he brought over accomplices?

23:15.698 --> 23:18.440
Well, if he did,
we need to know about it.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.703
I knew he was angry,

23:20.747 --> 23:22.749
but I never imagined
he'd do something like this.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.620
You never found it suspicious
that an army vet

23:24.664 --> 23:26.361
was helping people immigrate
from behind enemy lines?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.232
Just because people live
under a cloud of terrorism

23:28.276 --> 23:29.538
doesn't make them terrorists.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.888
And it wasn't people,
it was just one:

23:31.932 --> 23:33.847
Kalila, the woman
he wanted to marry.

23:33.890 --> 23:36.023
He was in love
with a Yemeni girl?

23:36.066 --> 23:37.807
Met her on his first tour,
got serious on the second.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.635
Nate spent two years
trying to bring her over.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.550
By the time he had the paperwork
and financials squared away,

23:41.594 --> 23:42.899
she died.

23:42.943 --> 23:45.902
Let me guess, a
U.S.-led drone strike?

23:45.946 --> 23:47.600
We didn't know
what happened at first.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.036
She just went radio silent.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.690
Nate flew over there
to look for her,

23:50.733 --> 23:52.648
and that's when
he found out the truth.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.607
Are you sure she's not connected
to the target of the strike?

23:54.650 --> 23:55.825
Playing Westerly for intel.

23:55.869 --> 23:56.826
No. Kalila worked in a market

23:56.870 --> 23:58.306
next to a building that was hit.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.613
Our government claims there
were no civilian casualties,

24:00.656 --> 24:01.962
but local residents
say otherwise.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.530
The army he served killed
the woman he loved.

24:04.573 --> 24:05.966
Now he's out
for revenge.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.620
Nate petitioned
Congress.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.622
Begged me to sue. He even found
leaked footage of the strike,

24:09.665 --> 24:11.319
wanted me to use it as evidence.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.147
When I finally convinced him
there was no prosecutable case,

24:13.190 --> 24:14.714
his phone calls
and e-mails just stopped.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.019
Do you have that footage?

24:16.063 --> 24:17.847
I have it on a flash drive.

24:17.891 --> 24:21.329
Yeah, see, see, you're playing
a young man's game.

24:21.372 --> 24:22.678
You're too aggressive.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.506
I'm just trying to win.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.552
Good luck against this hustler.
What brings you guys in?

24:26.595 --> 24:29.032
It's a little crazy around here.
It's not really the best time.

24:29.076 --> 24:32.340
Yeah, well, when is it
not crazy around here?

24:32.383 --> 24:34.995
Listen, the fridge is bare and
school's not back in for a week,

24:35.038 --> 24:36.213
so I thought I'd take Darryl out

24:36.257 --> 24:37.650
for lunch
and a movie,

24:37.693 --> 24:39.826
and we need you to bankroll us.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.436
HONDO:
You came over here
to get some money?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.004
Pops, you turned on the TV?
The city's under attack, man.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.528
Yeah, well, they can't fly
a drone into the movie theater.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.487
I'm just trying
to keep the boy safe.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.532
Hey, Darryl, do me a solid,

24:50.576 --> 24:52.012
grab yourself something
out of the kitchen.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.492
Just don't touch anything
that says "Hicks."

24:53.535 --> 24:54.928
That's my boss,
and he don't play.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.973
All right.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.629
All right, Pops,
real talk.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.154
What's going on
with you?

25:04.198 --> 25:06.243
Oh, there's gonna be
"real talk,"

25:06.287 --> 25:08.289
then you gonna have to ask
a more specific question.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.422
All right,
how about this?

25:11.466 --> 25:13.424
Me and Moms have been
trying real hard

25:13.468 --> 25:15.557
to create a stable
environment for Darryl,

25:15.601 --> 25:17.254
and we've been doing
a pretty good job.

25:17.298 --> 25:18.908
I'm not trying to step on that,

25:18.952 --> 25:21.868
and I'm not gonna add stress
to your life, promise.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.260
All due respect,

25:23.304 --> 25:25.828
but you've been known to
bounce pretty unpredictably,

25:25.872 --> 25:27.874
not to mention you ain't
said but two words to Mom

25:27.917 --> 25:29.353
over the years.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.095
Now, once she gets back
from Palm Springs,

25:32.139 --> 25:34.968
she's gonna be coming
back around the house.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.578
I can't have you
there for that.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.235
Why does this sound more like
a speech than a question, son?

25:41.278 --> 25:43.106
I'm getting to that.

25:43.150 --> 25:46.022
You cannot inject yourself
into the boy's life

25:46.066 --> 25:47.502
unless you intend
to stay in it.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.199
Still not a question.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.638
Do you know what kind of
damage you can do to Darryl?

25:55.858 --> 25:59.906
I'm sorry to hear
that my presence around him

25:59.949 --> 26:01.995
makes you so uncomfortable.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.518
Pops, I didn't,
I didn't say that.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.781
That's exactly what you said.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.436
I know the damage
that I did to you,

26:08.479 --> 26:11.961
and I can't go back
and change that.

26:13.963 --> 26:17.793
I just thought that I would try
a little bit harder this time.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.102
Hicks is ready for us.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.365
Yeah, I'm coming.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.804
I got to go, Pop.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.811
PILOT:
This is Beacon One. Weapons hot.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.987
Right select single fire.
Coded and ready.

26:38.031 --> 26:39.641
COLONEL BROWNING:
Copy, Beacon One.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.338
This is Delta Fox.
We have target confirmation.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.513
Let's light these bastards up.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.472
PILOT: Copy, Delta Fox.
Hellfire away.

26:44.515 --> 26:49.433
Impact in four, three, two...

26:49.477 --> 26:52.175
BROWNING:
Boom! No way the hajis
survived that hit.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.177
PILOT:
Debris field looks larger
than predicted.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.005
BROWNING:
Downside of dirt houses,
Beacon One.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.354
Locals will sweep it up.
Nice work.

26:57.398 --> 26:58.834
The man barking
the orders didn't sound

26:58.878 --> 27:00.531
too concerned about the
people in that market.

27:00.575 --> 27:03.099
Yeah, and imagine if your
girlfriend was one of 'em there.

27:03.143 --> 27:05.014
Well, if Westerly already
took out the drone's engineer

27:05.058 --> 27:07.538
and pilot, commanding officer
sure seems like a likely target.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.237
Okay, we need an ID and
location on this Delta Fox.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.847
Colonel Ben Browning,
stationed in Idaho

27:11.891 --> 27:13.109
but just flew in this morning.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.545
To Los Angeles?

27:14.589 --> 27:16.330
He's speaking at a military
academy near Downtown.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.810
Surrounded by
dozens of school kids.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.028
Future soldiers.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.727
He ain't going
after the drone plant.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.032
He's trying to teach
our military

27:23.076 --> 27:24.555
about collateral damage.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.135
Weapons ready and hot.

27:45.925 --> 27:48.710
The school's been notified,
but they got 600 students

27:48.754 --> 27:50.407
in the bleachers
of an outdoor stadium.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.105
Assuming Westerly has
eyes on the target,

27:52.148 --> 27:54.585
he could launch and then attack
as soon as they try to evacuate.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.718
We've dispatched snipers to
take out any incoming aircraft.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.981
Yeah, but if you damage your
drone without blowing that C-4,

27:59.025 --> 28:00.243
it could fall
on the crowd,

28:00.287 --> 28:01.941
Westerly could
still detonate it.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.465
Which is why we can't evacuate,
and snipers are our last resort.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.206
We got patrol canvassing
a five-mile radius

28:06.249 --> 28:07.642
looking for Westerly.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.470
FAA's got every bird in the sky
scanning for drones.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.951
Look, once we get eyes on it,
we can track it, right?

28:11.994 --> 28:14.475
The model he's using transmits
a pretty narrow frequency band.

28:14.518 --> 28:15.911
We should be able
to isolate it.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.044
That's the goal,
but it's gonna take some time,

28:18.087 --> 28:20.176
and we don't expect the drone
to go airborne

28:20.220 --> 28:21.830
until just before the colonel's
scheduled to speak.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.354
So somehow we need to lure the
weapon away from the students,

28:24.398 --> 28:26.835
keep it airborne long enough to
hone in on Westerly's position.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.924
How? What, make
him chase us?

28:28.968 --> 28:30.970
Except we can't put
Colonel Browning or any of you

28:31.013 --> 28:33.276
in risk of getting blown up.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.148
Think I have an idea.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.193
BROWNING:
Every strike I've ever led
has been clean.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.847
Now, can I say
with absolute certainty

28:38.891 --> 28:40.240
that no civilian
has ever perished

28:40.283 --> 28:41.850
as a result of one
of our missions? No.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.112
But I can say
with certainty

28:43.156 --> 28:44.331
that countless
young men and women

28:44.374 --> 28:45.811
serving in the
American Armed Forces

28:45.854 --> 28:47.856
have been kept from harm's way
thanks to our ability

28:47.900 --> 28:49.249
to terminate high-value targets

28:49.292 --> 28:50.729
without putting soldiers
in hot zones.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.818
I'm a vet myself, Colonel,
I know the drill.

28:52.861 --> 28:55.037
Well, we like to think all lives
are equal until someone we love

28:55.081 --> 28:56.604
is in harm's way, and
suddenly they matter more.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.345
My job is to love every single
soldier who serves under me.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.217
I imagine you feel the same
about the people of Los Angeles.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.349
100%.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.220
So what now?

29:04.264 --> 29:05.787
Once we get eyes on the weapon,

29:05.831 --> 29:07.746
we roll out and we lure it away
from those kids out there.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.443
If it moves towards the stadium,
we'll shoot it down.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.749
Then you won't be able
to track the pilot.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.576
Exactly.LUCA [over comms]: I got it.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.622
Half mile off.
Approaching from the west.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.843
Roger that. Traveling.
Let's move. Let's move.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.889
WOMAN:
...these three words
into every aspect of his life.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.805
A man who has dedicated
over 30 years

29:23.849 --> 29:26.025
to serving and protecting
this country.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.723
[cheering]

29:28.767 --> 29:30.420
As a decorated officer

29:30.464 --> 29:32.901
of the United States Air Force,
Colonel Benjamin Browning...

29:32.945 --> 29:34.555
Keep your head down,
don't look up.

29:34.598 --> 29:38.602
...commanded over 30 air strikes
upon enemy targets.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.736
There you are.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
[tires squeal]

29:46.262 --> 29:47.873
Where you going, Delta Fox?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.223
You can't run

29:50.266 --> 29:51.746
from fire in the sky.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.704
Traveling with the colonel.
You got eyes on the drone?

29:53.748 --> 29:55.706
Several of them. Tech is
scanning for radio signals

29:55.750 --> 29:57.883
to get a 20 on the remote.
It's gonna take a minute.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.841
Roger that.
Did he take the bait?HICKS: Affirmative.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.582
Armed drone passed the school.
He's on your tail.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.279
Approaching the overpass now.

30:15.422 --> 30:17.163
Think he went
for the switch?
We'll see.

30:17.206 --> 30:19.208
We got to keep him airborne
long enough to track

30:19.252 --> 30:21.776
the remote signal and get that
drone away from any civilians.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.212
My pleasure, Officer.

30:23.256 --> 30:25.258
[siren wailing]

30:30.306 --> 30:31.394
He's coming in
for the kill shot.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.395
You're gonna need
to shake him.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.354
[siren wailing]

30:34.397 --> 30:35.442
[tires screeching]

30:53.460 --> 30:55.549
Make a hard right ahead.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.029
There's an empty lot,
no civilians,

30:57.072 --> 30:58.508
where you can dance with him.Roger that.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.293
[tires screeching]

31:03.949 --> 31:06.603
HICKS: No lock on the drone pilot yet. Keep him in the air.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.828
Commander, we got
kids back here.Get away from 'em.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.613
[drone buzzing]

31:22.706 --> 31:25.274
[tires screeching]

31:26.449 --> 31:28.190
[siren wailing]

31:30.627 --> 31:32.455
[tires screeching]

31:37.460 --> 31:39.071
Got a lock on the remote signal.
Tracking the location.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.289
We just need one more minute.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.464
Keep stalling.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.907
[tires screeching]

32:00.222 --> 32:02.050
Got it. We have the suspect's
Code 6 location.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.834
Airship is responding
to put eyes on him.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.445
We're good, Hondo.
Pick a spot and end it.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.055
Roger that. Head
for that barrier.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.206
Nice driving.
Thanks.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.556
May need you to get me
out of a few tickets.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.253
I think we can arrange that.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.779
[helicopter blades whirring]

32:41.785 --> 32:43.526
[engine starts]

32:44.788 --> 32:46.790
[tires screeching]

32:50.577 --> 32:53.188
Suspect on the move
in a black two-door jeep.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.363
[siren wailing]

32:54.407 --> 32:55.538
[tires screech]

32:55.582 --> 32:56.844
Let's roll.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.802
All right, Luca. You got
the colonel and Walter

32:58.846 --> 33:00.021
until we nail this guy.LUCA:
All right.

33:00.065 --> 33:00.979
Go get him, boss.

33:04.069 --> 33:04.852
Go, go, go, go.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.775
PILOT:
Suspect turning
northeast onto Palm.

33:14.818 --> 33:17.952
Vehicle coming to a stop.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.780
Suspect exiting the vehicle.

33:19.823 --> 33:22.174
Entering a structure
on the north side.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.393
[siren chirps, tires screech]

33:28.354 --> 33:31.313
Limited penetration,
eyes and ears open.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.011
Listen for
the suspect.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.799
Stay liquid.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.204
[gunshot]Cover, cover, cover!

33:52.247 --> 33:54.162
[gunfire]WESTERLY: Stay back!

33:54.206 --> 33:56.773
I got more C-4!

34:06.957 --> 34:08.916
No one else needs to die, Nate!

34:08.959 --> 34:10.439
WESTERLY:
Been saying that for years.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.224
How come our lives
are more important

34:12.267 --> 34:14.095
than the people
our government slaughters?

34:14.139 --> 34:15.792
They're not, man!

34:15.836 --> 34:17.272
But this is not how you're gonna
get people to listen.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.060
HONDO [over radio]:
Deac, you got a visual?

34:22.103 --> 34:23.409
DEACON:
Negative.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.627
Give us a minute.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.673
Roger that.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.808
Look for a clear shot,
but keep your distance.

34:31.852 --> 34:34.115
We don't know how much C-4 he's
got or how he's got it rigged.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.378
You know what it's like
to love someone

34:36.422 --> 34:38.728
who means nothing to the country
you were ready to die for?

34:38.772 --> 34:40.861
Nate, I know about Kalila,

34:40.904 --> 34:42.906
and how much
that's got to hurt.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.473
CHRIS:
No shot. Need him
to inch out a bit.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.648
HONDO:
Roger that.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.520
Best person I ever met.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.043
Deacon, can you get an angle?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.654
DEACON:
Negative. But I got an idea.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.178
Our country won't even
admit she existed.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.355
Or that they
killed her.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.587
[cat meowing]

35:17.071 --> 35:19.073
[electricity discharging]

35:21.206 --> 35:23.730
Don't move. It's over.Hands behind your back!

35:26.254 --> 35:27.690
[grunts]

35:27.734 --> 35:30.389
Suspect in custody. Code 4.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.310
Nicely played
with the kitty-cat.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.834
And, hey, you, uh, heard Hondo
say "Stay liquid," right?

35:40.877 --> 35:42.531
DEACON:
Yeah, but that still leaves
three of us

35:42.575 --> 35:44.011
who have to split
the bill for the barbecue.

35:46.796 --> 35:47.971
Make that two.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.756
Hey. Is there something going on

35:49.799 --> 35:50.974
I should know about?

35:51.018 --> 35:52.106
No. Why?

35:53.281 --> 35:55.631
Deacon.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.677
You want to tell me
what the hell y'all are up to?

35:57.720 --> 35:59.592
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:02.421 --> 36:04.640
Please. Get out of here
with that.

36:04.684 --> 36:05.815
Y'all have been
watching my every move

36:05.859 --> 36:07.208
like you got
some inside joke running.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.644
Now what's up?CHRIS:
No, we're just trying

36:08.688 --> 36:09.819
to figure out who's
buying the food

36:09.863 --> 36:11.734
for tonight's barbecue.
That's all.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.129
Listen up, people, I ain't...

36:15.173 --> 36:17.218
[laughs]:
Yes! "Listen up..."

36:18.480 --> 36:20.830
Sorry. I just, um...
[clears throat]

36:20.874 --> 36:22.092
Deac's buying
the burgers and beer.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.790
What is wrong with you?

36:23.833 --> 36:26.184
Y'all are gonna make the man
with four kids and a mortgage

36:26.227 --> 36:27.837
foot the bill?All right, hey,
with overtime back,

36:27.881 --> 36:29.317
I'm doing okay.

36:29.361 --> 36:32.842
Besides, since, uh,
Hondo Bingo was my idea,

36:32.886 --> 36:34.540
it's only
right I lose.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.237
HONDO:
Wow.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.760
Hondo Bingo?

36:37.804 --> 36:38.805
Yeah.

36:38.848 --> 36:39.893
CHRIS:
Let's just say we all

36:39.936 --> 36:41.155
really missed you, boss.HONDO:
Okay.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.852
All right.
I can play this game, too.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.463
Burger time? Come on.

36:44.506 --> 36:46.421
Right now we still got
one more move to make.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.597
Some unfinished business
from this morning.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.685
Let's roll.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.560
DEACON:
In position.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.651
[door bangs]

36:58.694 --> 37:00.653
LAPD SWAT! Show me your hands!Give me two,
give me two, give me two!

37:02.220 --> 37:03.264
Now, on the ground!

37:03.308 --> 37:04.657
Kitchen clear!

37:04.700 --> 37:05.658
Dining room clear!

37:05.701 --> 37:07.834
Hands behind your back!

37:09.444 --> 37:11.664
30-David to Command.
We're Code 4.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.187
HONDO:
Roger that, Deac. Nice work.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.276
Now we can go home.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.932
âª Come on
and put your hands up âª

37:18.975 --> 37:21.195
âª Surrender to the music...

37:21.239 --> 37:22.457
DEACON:
Luca Lounge finally
in full swing.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.850
Yeah, man.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.330
Hey, it's a thing of beauty,
ain't it?

37:25.373 --> 37:27.027
It is. Yeah.You like it?

37:27.070 --> 37:28.463
âª Surrender to the music...

37:28.507 --> 37:30.422
Hey, thanks, Deac.
Appreciate it.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.424
Oh, now that's happening?

37:32.467 --> 37:35.165
Oh, okay, okay, so that was
your thing. The fist bump.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.993
Well, my bad for
leaving you hanging.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.299
That's all right.
Glad to have you back.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.997
It's good to be back.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.261
âª Come on
and put your hands up... âª

37:43.304 --> 37:45.001
Hey, Pop.Hmm?

37:45.045 --> 37:46.655
Thanks for bringing Darryl.

37:46.699 --> 37:49.179
I just think it's important
for him to feel welcome

37:49.223 --> 37:51.399
around my SWAT family.Hey, no worries.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.661
And listen, I've been thinking
about what you said

37:52.705 --> 37:53.749
down at the station.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.534
Okay, look, about that.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.492
I think I might've come off
a little too harsh.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.189
I never pulled any punches
with you,

37:59.233 --> 38:01.366
and I don't expect
nothing less in return.

38:01.409 --> 38:02.758
Truth is, you weren't wrong.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.238
I ain't looking for an apology.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.196
Well, that's good,
'cause that's not what this is.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.937
I'm trying to tell you
that I understand

38:07.981 --> 38:10.026
why you said
the things that you did,

38:10.070 --> 38:11.854
but I need you to understand

38:11.898 --> 38:16.337
that time and regrets,
they can change a man, son.

38:16.381 --> 38:19.471
âª Surrender to the music,
put your hands up... âª

38:19.514 --> 38:21.516
âª

38:24.911 --> 38:28.175
LYNCH:
Mayor's a fan of this
department for a reason.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.656
It was a pleasure working
with the best cops in the city.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.179
HICKS:
Well, thanks,
Lieutenant.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.007
And if the mayor is such a fan,

38:34.050 --> 38:35.835
maybe you can get her
to free up a little money,

38:35.878 --> 38:37.750
approve one of the candidates
I submitted

38:37.793 --> 38:39.186
to replace Captain Cortez.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.883
I'll talk to her.[knocking on door]

38:40.927 --> 38:43.146
Come in.Am I interrupting?

38:43.190 --> 38:45.018
Nope. On my way out.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.241
Well, I'm guessing you had
quite the day around here.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.939
[chuckles]
You have no idea.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.594
Nothing a little steak
and whiskey won't fix, I hope.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.335
Well, actually,
I was thinking I'd help you out

38:57.378 --> 38:59.293
with your work thing if
it's not too late to arrange it.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.470
Oh, don't worry about it. Jim
took care of it with me earlier.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.124
Jim Street?

39:04.167 --> 39:05.343
He volunteered.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.953
Ah. Did he, now?

39:06.996 --> 39:08.389
Is that a problem?

39:08.433 --> 39:10.826
Of course not. Why
would it be a problem?

39:14.482 --> 39:17.355
[indistinct chatter]

39:31.456 --> 39:33.719
Guess your mother
came back early.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.388
[door opens]

39:50.431 --> 39:51.911
DARRYL:
Ooh, it smells
delicious in here.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.782
There's my boys!

39:53.826 --> 39:55.480
You know I had to come
to make sure

39:55.523 --> 39:57.351
you both got back
in one piece.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.614
How was Australia?It was awesome.

39:59.658 --> 40:02.138
[chuckles]:
Oh!

40:02.182 --> 40:04.663
Hey, Mama.Hey.

40:04.706 --> 40:06.447
It's so good to be home.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.841
[chuckles]Mama, listen, uh...

40:08.884 --> 40:10.146
we didn't realize

40:10.190 --> 40:11.713
that you were gonna be
home so soon, and, um...

40:16.022 --> 40:17.980
My daddy is here with us.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.940
Your father's here?

40:20.983 --> 40:22.463
Now?

40:22.507 --> 40:24.073
Yes.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.771
Hey, stranger.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.556
How you been?

40:31.820 --> 40:34.736
Hello, Daniel.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.783
You look... alive.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.350
And you haven't
aged a day.

40:40.394 --> 40:43.005
Still a beauty.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.659
I'm afraid I didn't...

40:44.703 --> 40:46.618
cook enough for four.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.054
DARRYL:
Oh, no, it's okay.

40:48.097 --> 40:49.708
We ate at the barbecue.

40:50.665 --> 40:53.189
Uh, I mean,
but I'm still hungry.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.495
Definitely.

40:54.539 --> 40:55.888
[chuckles]

40:55.931 --> 40:58.368
Yeah, it's good
to be young, huh?

40:58.412 --> 41:00.370
[coughs]
You know, um,

41:00.414 --> 41:03.983
at my age, I eat half as much
and pee twice as often.

41:04.026 --> 41:07.465
[coughs]
So, if you'll excuse me, um,

41:07.508 --> 41:10.206
nature calls.
[coughs]

41:15.168 --> 41:17.170
Mama.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.956
I'm sorry.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.002
We'll make it work.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.661
[Daniel coughing]

41:34.579 --> 41:36.319
Damn it.

41:36.363 --> 41:37.799
HONDO:
You all right, Pop?

41:37.843 --> 41:39.584
Hmm?

41:39.627 --> 41:42.238
That cough
sounds a little nasty.Oh, it ain't nothing.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.892
Just getting over
a little something, that's all.

41:43.936 --> 41:47.417
[chuckles] Ain't nothing
your mama's cooking won't fix.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.116
[chuckles]
All right, then.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.902
Now let me get in here.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.730
Feel better.

41:55.774 --> 41:57.515
