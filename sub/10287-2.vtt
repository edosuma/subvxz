How about some dinner?

I shouldn't eat before surgery.

I think all this talk about the death
of casual sex is premature, don't you?

01:57.906 --> 02:00.568
Say, there's about 15 minutes
before we have to go back.

I'm gonna go across the street

- Charged with criminal mischief.
- Specifically?

He tried to dismantle a record store
with his bare hands, sir.

05:27.248 --> 05:30.581
- Why did you do that, Mr. Landon?
- I was battling the devil, Your Honor.

11:44.992 --> 11:46.960
- Is she all right?
- She'll be fine, Bernie.

11:47.128 --> 11:50.655
I went down for a cup of coffee,
and when I came back, they said she'd left.

11:51.098 --> 11:53.259
I had to get back to work.

11:53.434 --> 11:56.528
Selma, you know, you really
should've taken the whole day off.

11:56.704 --> 12:00.572
Any surgical procedure,
no matter how small, can be...

12:02.410 --> 12:04.173
Debilitating.

12:04.345 --> 12:06.779
Don't lick.

12:08.416 --> 12:10.077
SELMA:
I'm hungry.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.310
- Can she eat, Your Honor?
- Yeah, that's fine.

12:12.486 --> 12:15.751
Doctor said to keep an eye on her,
make sure she doesn't hurt herself.

12:15.923 --> 12:16.947
Come on, Selma.

12:17.124 --> 12:19.217
Let's go get that dinner I promised you.

12:19.393 --> 12:22.419
Oh, you're a magical kind of guy, Bernie.

12:22.596 --> 12:25.895
- Oh, Selma, l...
SELMA: Bernie, please.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.698
Don't talk.

12:27.868 --> 12:30.837
I hate it when you talk.

12:31.806 --> 12:33.137
Come on, let's go.

12:33.307 --> 12:35.468
Nummy time.

12:36.343 --> 12:39.005
- This should be fun. You coming?
- Maybe later. Go ahead.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.011
Have a good time.

12:43.551 --> 12:45.815
Let me know
when you're ready to start up again.

12:45.986 --> 12:50.616
Yeah, I'm just gonna listen to a little
forward TormÃ©, and then I'll be ready.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.554
Okay.

12:52.827 --> 12:56.593
You jailed my father.

12:57.298 --> 13:00.233
Miss Sullivan to see you, sir.

13:00.801 --> 13:02.666
What's this about jail and your father?

13:02.837 --> 13:05.169
I think she means
the nut you cited for contempt.

13:05.339 --> 13:07.534
Yes, that nut was my father.

13:07.708 --> 13:09.801
No kidding.

13:09.977 --> 13:12.411
Small world, ain't it?

13:12.580 --> 13:13.842
I wanna know what happened.

13:14.014 --> 13:16.642
- Have some cocoa, talk about it.
- I don't want any cocoa.

13:16.817 --> 13:20.014
- How about something cold?
- I believe you finished off the Kool-Aid.

13:20.187 --> 13:22.451
I don't want anything to drink.

13:22.623 --> 13:25.456
I just wanna talk to you alone, sir.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.193
Oh.

13:27.361 --> 13:30.262
Well, I've got a few delicates
to rinse out.

13:30.431 --> 13:31.898
Excuse me.

13:35.970 --> 13:38.461
Miss Sullivan, I had no idea
that man was your father.

13:38.639 --> 13:41.608
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Now, calm down and we'll discuss this.

13:41.776 --> 13:42.800
Calm down?

13:42.977 --> 13:45.844
I look like a fool in court,
you throw my father in jail...

13:46.013 --> 13:48.379
...how do you expect me to calm down?
- The Velvet Fog.

13:48.549 --> 13:49.743
- What?
- Mel TormÃ©.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.181
This guy could soothe a charging rhino.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.820
- You know, jazz singing...
- Look.

13:53.988 --> 13:55.819
I know I may not be long for this job...

13:55.990 --> 13:58.424
Hey, hey,
I think you're gonna do a fine job...

13:58.592 --> 14:02.084
...as soon as you learn
a couple of simple things.

14:02.263 --> 14:05.596
Now, I assume you know the difference
between jazz and pop singing.

14:05.766 --> 14:08.792
I don't care what the difference is
between jazz and pop singing.

14:10.104 --> 14:11.662
Tell me you don't mean that.

14:11.839 --> 14:13.568
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

14:14.475 --> 14:15.737
Your Honor?

14:15.910 --> 14:18.674
- Oh, you're busy.
- No, Bull. Come on in.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.908
Bull, there's a piece of paper
attached to you.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.784
Selma stapled it to me.

14:26.253 --> 14:27.311
Doesn't it hurt?

14:27.755 --> 14:29.552
Like the dickens, Your Honor.

14:30.925 --> 14:34.486
I just stopped by to tell you
I'm gonna take that contempt to processing.

14:34.662 --> 14:38.723
Why don't you go talk to your father?
If he apologizes, I'll release him.

14:38.899 --> 14:42.062
My father?
He will never apologize to you.

14:42.236 --> 14:44.727
Get him some magazines, Bull.

14:44.905 --> 14:48.136
He's a proud man, who, in his mind,
simply defended his little girl...

14:48.309 --> 14:51.369
...from an unfair attack.
He will never apologize for that.

14:51.879 --> 14:53.540
Make it a subscription.

14:55.182 --> 14:58.117
- Okay, I'll talk to him.
- What a good idea.

14:58.285 --> 15:00.219
Then I wanna see you both back here.

15:01.155 --> 15:02.349
Yes, sir.

15:02.523 --> 15:05.390
- Anything else, sir?
- No. Thanks, Bull.

15:14.602 --> 15:17.537
Here you go, my darling.

15:52.673 --> 15:53.731
SULLIVAN:
The man is scum.

15:53.908 --> 15:56.342
He always was scum.
He always will be scum.

15:56.510 --> 15:58.910
Your Honor, my client says he's sorry.

15:59.413 --> 16:02.940
I'd like to hear Mr. Sullivan
express those sentiments for himself.

16:03.117 --> 16:05.017
I got a couple a sentiments here for you.

16:05.185 --> 16:08.712
Your Honor, may I explain
to my pigheaded client...

16:08.889 --> 16:13.258
...that under the rules of contempt, he may
be imprisoned until he decides to comply?

16:13.427 --> 16:16.521
- I know all that. Aphrodite told me.
- Who?

16:20.868 --> 16:23.393
She's a friend of your late mother's.

16:24.305 --> 16:27.206
You got yourself
a wonderful daughter here, Mr. Sullivan.

16:27.374 --> 16:30.241
Is that why you're trying to make
a fool out of her in court?

16:30.411 --> 16:33.380
Daddy, he didn't make a fool of me.

16:37.952 --> 16:39.249
I made a fool of myself.

16:39.420 --> 16:42.981
Christine, don't let your dead mother
hear you talk like that.

16:44.625 --> 16:47.753
Technically, I was equipped.

16:47.928 --> 16:51.989
But emotionally, I blew it, right?

16:52.166 --> 16:56.193
You were a bit, shall we say, overzealous.

16:56.770 --> 16:58.931
- Runs in the family.
- Yeah, I noticed.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.074
But what brought you to this conclusion?

17:02.242 --> 17:05.608
- I had a talk with my client, Landon.
- That creep with the tape recorder?

17:05.779 --> 17:08.646
- Did he touch you?
- Daddy, stuff it.

17:09.316 --> 17:10.476
He wants me to thank you.

17:10.917 --> 17:13.546
- For what?
- Yeah, for what?

17:13.820 --> 17:15.253
For listening to him.

17:15.422 --> 17:17.890
He said it was the first time
anybody had done that.

17:18.325 --> 17:20.054
That's my job.

17:21.228 --> 17:23.458
It's my job too, isn't it?

17:25.965 --> 17:27.866
Sustained.

17:28.035 --> 17:30.026
- Pardon?
- Your motion to have your client...

17:30.204 --> 17:32.672
...held over for psychiatric evaluation.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.968
Your point was absolutely correct
and obvious.

17:36.143 --> 17:38.668
Congratulations on your first win.

17:41.715 --> 17:43.979
What the hell happened?

17:44.451 --> 17:47.249
Your girl did good, Mr. Sullivan.

17:47.721 --> 17:50.918
Now, apologize to the man, Daddy,
and let's get out of here.

17:51.091 --> 17:54.083
Corporate law, that's what I told her.
That's where the money is.

17:54.261 --> 17:56.229
Oh, Daddy, shut up.

17:56.730 --> 17:59.790
You almost ruined today for me,
just like you ruined my graduation.

17:59.967 --> 18:03.232
- What'd he do?
- He rushed up on-stage with a camera.

18:03.404 --> 18:04.837
I need the close-up.

18:05.005 --> 18:06.632
You needed a leash, Daddy.

18:06.807 --> 18:10.334
Don't you understand?
This was an important moment for me.

18:10.511 --> 18:13.071
I was nervous as it was.
It was my first night in court.

18:13.247 --> 18:15.841
I was dealing with an oddball judge.

18:19.286 --> 18:22.551
They told you about the teeth,
didn't they?

18:25.926 --> 18:28.156
- Christine, l...
- What?

18:30.097 --> 18:35.865
Christine, your father is trying to tell you
that he is very proud of you...

18:36.036 --> 18:38.266
...in a criminal sort of way.

18:40.140 --> 18:43.906
I, uh... I guess I opened my big mouth
enough for one day, huh?

18:44.978 --> 18:46.843
Sustained.

18:49.650 --> 18:51.880
Forgive me, baby, will you?

18:52.419 --> 18:53.681
I'm sorry.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.751
I'm sorry too, Daddy.

18:58.425 --> 19:01.360
Being a judge means
never having to say you're sorry.

19:04.865 --> 19:06.560
Your Honor...

19:06.800 --> 19:12.864
...I apologize for saying I hated your filthy,
rotten, stinking, slime-soaked guts.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.134
I feel I've been trashed
by the best, Mr. Sullivan.

19:16.310 --> 19:18.175
Apology accepted. You're free to go.

19:18.345 --> 19:20.438
Thank you, Your Honor.

19:21.315 --> 19:23.476
I better run.

19:25.986 --> 19:27.578
Well, uh...

19:29.123 --> 19:30.590
Break a leg, counselor.

19:34.561 --> 19:35.585
Bye, Daddy.

19:37.764 --> 19:39.664
Bye, peaches.

19:46.740 --> 19:47.968
Christine?

19:50.811 --> 19:53.609
Great, I got you with a judge.

19:56.450 --> 19:57.917
Quite a first day in court, huh?

19:58.752 --> 20:03.121
- Not exactly how I had pictured it.
- No, it never is.

20:04.224 --> 20:08.320
You know, I'm sorry that you
will not be with us permanently.

20:08.495 --> 20:10.224
You are a good attorney.

20:10.797 --> 20:13.493
I wish I could stay too.
I feel like I could learn here.

20:13.667 --> 20:17.967
Well, you learn from any experience.
You gain knowledge through action.

20:18.138 --> 20:21.073
Absorb confidence with time.

20:21.241 --> 20:24.039
Our children would be blond.

20:26.613 --> 20:28.706
I beg your pardon?

20:28.882 --> 20:31.715
Genetics. It's my hobby.

20:31.885 --> 20:34.513
We'll talk about it after work.

20:34.755 --> 20:38.316
I'm gonna go check in on Selma, and then
we'll tackle that backlog of injustice.

20:38.492 --> 20:40.460
- Right, fine. Your Honor?
- Mm-hm.

20:42.496 --> 20:43.895
Thank you for everything.

20:44.331 --> 20:47.027
You are very welcome.

20:47.634 --> 20:49.101
- Can I call you "peaches"?
- No.

20:49.269 --> 20:50.293
I didn't think so.

20:58.512 --> 20:59.979
MAC: What is it?
- I don't know.

21:00.147 --> 21:04.311
But I saw a couple of wildebeest do that
on <i>National Geographic.</i>

21:05.252 --> 21:09.916
- How's it going?
- I'm gonna boogie until I puke.

21:11.658 --> 21:13.489
Selma, I want you to go home.

21:13.660 --> 21:17.721
SELMA: Can't. Gotta go to work.
- Selma, you are in no condition to work.

21:17.898 --> 21:19.297
Says you.

21:19.466 --> 21:25.632
I haven't missed a day in 27 years,
and I'm not gonna start now.

21:26.206 --> 21:29.539
- Selma, I had no idea.
- Nobody had any idea.

21:30.277 --> 21:34.008
Why the hell did you think
it was that important for me...

21:34.181 --> 21:37.048
...to come back here today?

21:40.754 --> 21:42.722
My health?

21:43.890 --> 21:47.951
- Your Honor, this means a lot to her.
- Bull, she is in no shape to work.

21:48.128 --> 21:50.722
Twenty-seven years
without missing a day?

21:50.897 --> 21:54.856
Couldn't we let her just come in,
perform one duty, and then take her home?

21:55.535 --> 21:57.366
You mean, like an official time at bat?

21:59.439 --> 22:02.636
Good Lord, it's the Lou Gehrig story.

22:15.088 --> 22:16.180
Selma.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.567
What?

22:33.106 --> 22:37.202
Take these bail reports to Bull.

22:38.211 --> 22:39.940
Right.

22:55.962 --> 22:57.691
Here.

23:00.033 --> 23:02.934
Now take me home.
