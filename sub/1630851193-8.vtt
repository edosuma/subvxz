11:15.979 --> 11:18.503
You want to go back to
my home movie theater, Dawson?

11:18.547 --> 11:21.115
Sounds great. Love to see
the old neighborhood.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.639
Not you, Todd.
You're not invited.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.249

11:25.293 --> 11:27.425
-Buh-bye!
-Burn!

Those boys aren't thatcool.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.082
Just kinda.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.605
Oh, Dad, it's fine.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.824
When you get as many A's
as I do,

11:34.868 --> 11:36.434
you deserve a couple wedgies.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.828
It kinda goes with
the territory. I'm fine with it.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.874
Such a great idea
to use Todd's dad

11:40.917 --> 11:42.832
as a guinea pig
for those drugs.

11:42.876 --> 11:46.488
Yeah, I got to see what Molly
does to someone before I try it.

11:46.531 --> 11:50.710
Really? Uh, I put
all the mushrooms on it, too.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.146
[Freddie chuckles]

11:52.189 --> 11:54.278
Ah...

11:57.064 --> 12:00.197
I'll show everyone
I'm not trash.

12:03.810 --> 12:08.249
I'll show everyone who's
the top citizen in this town.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.082

of Sling Blade

12:15.125 --> 12:17.954
to direct himself
in his own movie.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.436
[ladder rattles]

12:25.832 --> 12:28.835
And now, they're
all gonna be like, "Whoa.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.141
"This is a special woman,
and we should never be a cook

12:31.185 --> 12:32.839

actions that we bear witness to

Told you!

12:40.107 --> 12:41.543

12:43.632 --> 12:45.025
-[chanting]: Sling Blade...!
-Y'all know Scottie Pippen's
from Arkansas, too.

12:45.068 --> 12:48.158
I heard he's got a band. Fuck.
Get him up here. Shit.

12:48.202 --> 12:51.292
What you need, Sling Blade?
Uh, dang it, I mean, Billy Bob?

12:51.335 --> 12:52.859
Coffee? Energy drink?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.774
Nah, I'm gonna need
something stronger.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.169
-Ah...

13:00.301 --> 13:01.519

Got to hit Brad Pitt up
for more.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.002

the source for a good while.

Any minute now,

13:15.751 --> 13:18.798
that guy is gonna freak out.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.451
I wonder where Ollie is.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.845
[chuckles]:
Ooh. Oh, man.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.499
Hey, come on, Todd,
let's just

13:24.542 --> 13:27.241
you and me take everything
the fest has to offer.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.721
You know,
I mean, Ollie is fine.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.724
Ooh, man, I feel good. Wow.

13:32.768 --> 13:35.118

Anyway, you know,
it's a safe place.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.818
Ooh, let's play this!

Oh, man.

13:57.445 --> 14:00.230
F-ing awesome over here!

Holy shit, look at Freddie!

-Well, okay, okay, Freddie boy.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.455
-FREDDIE: Freddie's here!
-Having some fun, eh,
kicking people in dicks

14:07.498 --> 14:09.631

and flying around,

14:48.757 --> 14:50.498
You done activated me.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.501
Time to take this up a notch
to level two.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.937
[phone beeps]

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
There's some unforeseen
husky Wonder Woman

14:57.331 --> 14:59.594
pulling a Home Aloneon us.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.683
[quiet chatter]

to please your lady.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.559
-Wow.
-Wow! [chuckles]

15:08.603 --> 15:10.170
You're pretty cool, man.

15:10.213 --> 15:13.086
Why do you hang out
with this gross little nobody?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.609
Oh, shit.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.219
Todd is cool, man.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.612
Cooler than you,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.657
because he still tries
to be nice to you

15:19.701 --> 15:21.746
even though
you're little shitheads.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.793
He's got a good heart,
and he's smart as hell.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.838
Plus, that's my son, dude.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.232
So chill out or watch out.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.148
Dude, you destroy us with words.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.028
It just wasn't the same
without you.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.420
Oh, a penny for luck!

15:44.334 --> 15:46.249
Oh! Oh, my God, Ollie!

15:46.293 --> 15:47.947
[groans] Are you okay?

15:47.990 --> 15:51.776
Whoa, I nearly got deadened
right there, Mom.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.517
What are you up to?

15:53.561 --> 15:55.780
Defending the neighborhood
from robbers like Wonder Woman.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.608
Why is Wonder Woman just like

15:57.652 --> 16:00.133
all the shitty men heroes
who just fight, fight, fight?

16:00.176 --> 16:03.179
Sometimes you got to fight,
babe. Now get inside.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.138
We say it's bad
that men are violent,

16:05.181 --> 16:07.227
and that they should be more
like us rad women

16:07.270 --> 16:09.533
who use our words
to overcome conflicts.

16:09.577 --> 16:12.710
But then we just make her
behave like a dude.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.016
[whispers]:
Listen to me.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.496
There are violent criminals
here,

16:15.539 --> 16:17.193
so I'm getting violent!

16:17.237 --> 16:18.847
-And drunk.
-And drunk, yes.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.240
Limbers me up.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.416
I say we try diplomacy
with the bad guys,

16:22.459 --> 16:24.418
'cause these traps look mean.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.030
Whoa, Mom! No!

16:28.074 --> 16:30.641
They're just robbers.
You can't kill people.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.035
You know what,
I am not passing up my moment

16:33.079 --> 16:34.297
to win back the hearts
of this town.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.082
-So...
-[grunting]

16:36.125 --> 16:38.606
-Ow!
-I got to subdue and present

16:38.649 --> 16:40.216
all these bad guys, Ollie.
But I do hear you.

16:40.260 --> 16:41.565
I promise I won't kill anyone
on purpose.

16:41.609 --> 16:42.566
Okay, good talk!

16:42.610 --> 16:44.568

16:44.612 --> 16:49.138
Things should be
right on schedule.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.446
[cheering]

16:53.447 --> 16:55.101
Mel Gibson...

16:55.144 --> 16:58.104
was in my favorite
Fourth of July movie:

16:58.147 --> 16:59.540
The Patriot.

17:00.497 --> 17:05.198
Mel was in this movie
back in the year 2000, y'all.

17:05.241 --> 17:08.375
He was an American
defending his homeland

17:08.418 --> 17:12.074
against the redcoats,
and he bathed in their blood

17:12.118 --> 17:15.425
like any red-blooded
American would do.

17:15.469 --> 17:18.515
He knew that
defending your home was

17:18.559 --> 17:21.301
the most important thing.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.129
And we didn't listen.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.782
Thus 9/11.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.829
So y'all should listen to me

17:27.872 --> 17:30.223
and buy one of
my home security systems

17:30.266 --> 17:32.703
from Kelley Frakes
White Glove Security.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.157
Whoa. Please. No, no, woman.

Damn Kelley Frakes will
always fuck you over.

18:08.696 --> 18:11.525
Kelley? She'll fuck us over?

18:11.568 --> 18:14.223
Wait a second, does Kelley have
something to do with all this?

18:15.616 --> 18:19.141
Uh... let's talk?

18:23.363 --> 18:24.538
[grunts]

18:25.843 --> 18:28.716
I guess violence is in my genes.

18:28.759 --> 18:31.936
And if the "mom genes" fit,
wear 'em.

with you lovely mamas

Dad, you're dosed with drugs,
and we forgot about Ollie.

Ollie was right!

Damn, but all you robbers are
super messed up

19:10.279 --> 19:14.979
Yes. This was meant to be
"no contact" job.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.418
-Our weapons are fake.
-It was Kelley.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.377
She hired us to rob this

you drunken trash?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.227

They told me you hired them
to rob the neighborhood.

Oh, that's the booze talking.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.193
50-50. And now, guess what?

19:54.236 --> 19:56.760
I'm getting up on that stage
to say that you hired them

19:56.804 --> 20:00.111
so everyone would believe that
crime was on the rise in town,

20:00.155 --> 20:04.507
so they would then also buy
your new security system. Aha!

20:04.551 --> 20:07.249
You're taking advantage
of America's fear of violence,

20:07.293 --> 20:09.556
which comes from America's
addiction to violence,

21:09.964 --> 21:12.096
Get 'em out of here, boys!

21:14.011 --> 21:16.362
Good run being fun, man.
Too bad.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.102
Mm-hmm.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.801
-Ha-ha! [laughs]
-Later!

[groans]

21:24.979 --> 21:26.589
That's good, kids.
You're doing great.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.765
Just take the alleys
and back roads.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.855
-[fireworks crackling]
-Ah...

21:31.899 --> 21:33.727
Happy birthday, July.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.033
I'm so sorry, everyone.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.645
I feel like such a hypocrite
for scolding you, Deb.

21:38.688 --> 21:43.302
I'm hungover, sunburned,
somehow I lost my shoes.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.086
Welcome to being me, babe.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.355
Seems you all have had
a learning type of day.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.966
Tell me, what did you learn,
girl person?

21:56.010 --> 21:57.359
That...

21:57.403 --> 22:01.232
I'm a lot like my mom,
and she's a lot like me.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.147
And you, scowl-faced lad?

22:03.191 --> 22:05.889
I guess I learned that life is
a series of embarrassments.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.370
And if it's not one parent
then it's the other.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.721
And my old friends,
they're just sucky dicks.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.550
Yes, that's true.
Dicks are a dime a dozen.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.900
I learned "diplomacy" sucks

22:16.944 --> 22:19.163
Don't talk until
your name's called, Mother.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.035
Bad form, that.
[clicking tongue]

22:21.078 --> 22:22.471
Now, broken man.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.908
-Are you the father?
-Yep.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.084
Yeah. Yes.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.695
And your lesson?

22:28.738 --> 22:31.262
Well, I learned that
even though mushrooms and Molly

22:31.306 --> 22:34.788
make me the person
I've always dreamed of being

22:34.831 --> 22:38.269
but somehow was not really
ever able to be...

22:38.313 --> 22:40.837
eh, they're just not really
for me.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.319
And I just learned...

22:44.363 --> 22:47.278
where my lost bag of drugs
ended up.
