Aidan needs to be stomped
by the spider shoe.

family barbecue afterward,

introduce him to the guys.

for calling him a jerk-face.

You're not wrong.
His face can be super jerky.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.210

he acts selfish

06:14.210 --> 06:16.420

06:16.420 --> 06:18.250
where was I going with this?

06:18.250 --> 06:21.040
Aidan only looks out for himself
because he doesn't have

06:21.040 --> 06:23.920

to show him how to act.

something important.

have brothers and sisters.

would keep him in line.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.790
Okay, now I have
something to say,

06:38.790 --> 06:40.790
and no one imitate me.

06:40.790 --> 06:42.790
While Aidan's here,

06:42.790 --> 06:44.790
our family can be
a good influence.

06:44.790 --> 06:46.420
Which should be fun,

06:46.420 --> 06:48.330
since it's something
our family's never done before.

06:48.330 --> 06:50.330
Oh, I could show him
a thing or two.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.210

to toot my own horn,

-Totally.

Right after I practice on you.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.380
I'm hoping you're
only holding that guitar

-Knock, knock."
-Who's there?

08:00.250 --> 08:03.330
No, that's not where
I was going with that!

08:03.330 --> 08:05.380
This is terrible!

08:05.380 --> 08:08.830
Why won't he just respond
to one of my emails

08:08.830 --> 08:11.330
or DMs or paperless invites?

08:11.330 --> 08:14.040
Here's what you need to say.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.120
"You, sir,
are invited to see

virus movie ever made!

And then come back to life
and see it again."

08:26.210 --> 08:28.170
Perfect.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.290
That's what you'll say to Shane
when you come with me.

08:30.290 --> 08:33.080
I can't. Hello!

08:33.080 --> 08:36.080
Party flow chart? Flow?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.120
And there's no party
if we don't have Shane.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.210
You heard my pitch.

08:41.210 --> 08:43.420
You made sour-lemon face
the whole time.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.750
Come on,
you said it yourself--

08:45.750 --> 08:48.790
the power of a big family?

08:48.790 --> 08:52.080
Fine.
Let's go to Shane's.

08:53.750 --> 08:54.960
Leave it!

08:57.330 --> 08:59.290
[Ethan] Harley, come on,
we've got to go!

08:59.290 --> 09:02.290
Be right there!
So you're on set-up.

09:02.290 --> 09:04.380
Lewie and Beast are snacks,
Mom and Dad will take care

09:04.380 --> 09:07.420
of setting up the stage
and screen-- you know what?

09:07.420 --> 09:09.460
There's a color-coded flowchart
up in our room.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.960
Gee, Harley!
This is a lot of work!

09:11.960 --> 09:13.920
I don't know how
we'll ever get it all done!

09:13.920 --> 09:16.120
Don't worry, we're fine,
I just wanna set up

09:16.120 --> 09:18.330
a scenario where Aidan
will want to be helpful.

09:19.830 --> 09:22.790
Georgie!
I am very worried!

09:22.790 --> 09:26.500
Leaving all this work,
with a big party tonight?!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.170
I actually am worried,
but that might help, too.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.460
Good idea to wear the costume
you designed for my movie.

09:33.460 --> 09:36.210
This should really
get Shane's attention.

09:36.210 --> 09:39.120
Plus, it made for
an interesting bus ride.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.080
I don't know how
a zombie virus even spreads.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.790
People move really quick
when they see one coming.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.790
I'm live-streaming
Shane's show

09:46.790 --> 09:49.040
so we can knock on his door
the minute it's over.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.000
Let's hope that's soon.
Time's ticking on the party.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.420
And I forgot to tell Georgie
to rope off the V.I.P. section,

09:54.420 --> 09:58.710
which, to stay on theme,
I'm calling the R.I.P. section.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.960
[television playing]

10:05.330 --> 10:07.750
[grunts] Boy...

10:07.750 --> 10:11.210
I don't remember these chairs
being this heavy.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.540
It's kind of a situation

10:13.540 --> 10:15.830
where you're grateful
for a helping hand.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.830
You shouldn't be lifting that.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.790
Just push it across
the floor with your foot.

10:19.790 --> 10:21.960
Man, you sure got stuck
with a terrible job.

10:25.830 --> 10:29.380
[sighs] We have a lot of
really good candy here, Beast.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.120
I can't wait to share it
at the party.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.420
Yeah, sharing
makes me feel good.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.460
Me too.
Thanks for sharing.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.040
Hey, those are for
our guests.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.040
People are coming to your house
and getting candy

10:43.040 --> 10:44.330
and you're not even allowed
to eat it?

10:44.330 --> 10:48.750
It's because our parents--
our brother--

10:48.750 --> 10:53.080
uh... our parents--
our brother--

10:55.460 --> 10:59.210
Explain to me why we're
giving these to strangers.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.830
I was hoping you would.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what are you doing?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.380
That's our movie screen
for tonight.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.170
I'm sorry, just all those
bird-poop stains

11:13.170 --> 11:14.500
are great
for target practice.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.710
[groans]
We scrubbed for an hour.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.040
What do those birds eat?

11:19.040 --> 11:20.790
Any backyard movie
I've ever been to,

11:20.790 --> 11:22.750
they always had one of those
big blow-up screens.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.750
They did?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.000
[both] Oh.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.330
Look, I volunteered because
I knew no one else would.

11:30.330 --> 11:32.290
That's what you do
in big families, you step up.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.920
Sounds more like you're
getting stepped on.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.460
Everybody's got a job.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.380
Lewie and Beast
are in charge of snacks--

11:37.380 --> 11:39.710
which is really just
filling up bags with candy.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.830
Mom and Dad are putting up
a movie screen--

11:41.830 --> 11:44.420
which is mostly pulling
a tarp out of the garage.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.540
And Harley's supervising--
which she handed off to me.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.790
[gasps]
How did this happen?

11:50.790 --> 11:53.330
Look, we promised to give
Ethan a special night.

11:53.330 --> 11:55.460
We'll have him buy us
even fancier chocolate

11:55.460 --> 11:56.920
when he gets famous.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.250
We're playing the long game.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.830
I guess
if it makes sense to you.

12:01.830 --> 12:04.250
If it were me, I'd take
half the candy for myself.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.710
Who would know?

12:09.170 --> 12:11.040
Look, it's kind of
a gross-out movie.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.580
Bird-poop screen
feels appropriate.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.620
Hey, I get it.
Seven kids.

12:14.620 --> 12:16.420
Busy.
You do what you can.

12:16.420 --> 12:20.080
Which, in our case,
is a bird-turd blanket.

12:23.620 --> 12:26.750
Let them do the grunt work.
Thanks, Aidan.

12:26.750 --> 12:29.120
[cheering on television]

12:29.120 --> 12:31.710
Let's go split these.
Thanks, Aidan.

12:33.290 --> 12:35.460
We need a screen
that's not a bird toilet.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.750
Thanks, Aidan.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.040
Now for our online poll
of which zombie ate it best.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.540
Grant from Rhode Island
says Grandma Betty

12:45.540 --> 12:47.750
was no match
for Sheriff Johnson...

12:47.750 --> 12:49.580
He's doing his wrap-up.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.250
Okay, let's get these
tablets up and running.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.880
I want to look my worst.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.210
[bleep]

12:57.080 --> 12:58.460
What's that noise?

13:00.250 --> 13:02.710
-Is that--
-That's us.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.170
Forget about a movie screen.

13:18.170 --> 13:21.000
This thing is so big, we could
use it to sail to the New World.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.210
I can't believe they only had
the floor model left.

13:23.210 --> 13:26.120
I mean, how many backyard movie
premieres are happening tonight?

13:34.920 --> 13:37.580
You ruined my biggest show
of the year!

13:37.580 --> 13:40.210
Sorry! Funny story.
Costume has tablet front.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.120
Tablet back.
Mirror technology.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.960
Remote, garage, same frequency--
not important.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.420
What is important
is my brother directed

13:48.420 --> 13:50.080
an awesome zombie movie.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.120
We're having an exclusive
premiere tonight,

13:53.120 --> 13:56.330
and we'd love for you
to be the honored guest.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.040
So what do you say?

13:59.040 --> 14:00.880
I'm calling the police.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.290
What is this?

14:04.290 --> 14:07.080
That's your phone.
We really rattled him, Harley.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.790
The clip of you guys
interrupting my show

14:09.790 --> 14:11.330
is blowing up.

14:11.330 --> 14:13.120
[chuckles]
It's going crazy viral!

14:13.120 --> 14:16.920
[gasps] Even the snobby
sci-fi geeks are reposting it!

14:16.920 --> 14:18.170
[laughs]

14:18.170 --> 14:20.120
Sounds like you
kind of owe us one.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.000
My movie's only an hour.
So what do you say?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.960
I'll let you use
this costume for your set.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.920
This gore score
is off the charts!

14:30.920 --> 14:34.080
Should've started with that.
I'll be there.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.290
You won't regret it.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.620
The movie's amazing,
and the party will be, too.

14:39.620 --> 14:42.290
We've got a whole team
working on it as we speak.

14:43.540 --> 14:46.420
The party starts in an hour.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.210
I don't know what happened,

14:48.210 --> 14:51.120
but our family better
have been eaten by zombies.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.880
Where's the snack bar?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.960
The-- the red carpet?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.420
My little stage?

14:59.420 --> 15:01.000
If we're going to solve this,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.960
we're gonna have
to divide and conquer.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.670
I'll take Georgie.
You take the twins.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.540
How come you got the easy one?

15:06.540 --> 15:08.080
Perks of coming up
with the plan.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.670
You're supposed
to be setting up!

15:13.670 --> 15:15.420
I thought Aidan
was helping you.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.830
No. He left a while ago.
And I'm done doing grunt work.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.380
If you want my help,
I get a cushy,

15:20.380 --> 15:22.330
front-of the-house job--
checking in guests.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.670
What's going on?
W-where are the gift bags?

15:28.670 --> 15:31.250
I thought you'd be done
by now!

15:31.250 --> 15:32.500
We are.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.670
Why is there only
one piece of candy?

15:41.670 --> 15:44.920
Aidan said if we take half,
who would know?

15:44.920 --> 15:49.210
I hate to say it, but I think
someone might know now.

15:49.210 --> 15:54.290
Hey, fancy gift bags usually
come with lots of tissue paper.

15:54.290 --> 15:57.170
This is toilet paper!

15:57.170 --> 15:59.880
-Who would know?
-I would!

15:59.880 --> 16:02.580
The guests would!
Shane would!

16:02.580 --> 16:06.960
I'll fill the bags myself.
Where's the rest of the candy?

16:06.960 --> 16:09.330
That is the rest.
[scoffs]

16:09.330 --> 16:12.750
You ate eight pounds of candy?!

16:12.750 --> 16:16.040
What do you think we are,
idiots?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.960
Seven pounds
are buried in the yard.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.710
Georgie's acting like
an entirely different person.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.960
The twins went rogue
on the gift bags.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.790
Something weird is going on.

16:26.790 --> 16:29.460
Instead of stepping up
big family style,

16:29.460 --> 16:31.460
they're acting like
a bunch of jerk-faces.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.290
[both] Aidan!

16:35.290 --> 16:37.460
He's run through this entire
house like an infection!

16:37.460 --> 16:39.080
We have to warn mom and dad.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.210
Where are mom and dad?

16:41.210 --> 16:45.120
All right, took a little longer
time than we expected,

16:45.120 --> 16:48.420
but we finally wrestled
this baby into submission.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.580
Let's hit the road, we still
have to set up Ethan's stage.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.330
Because apparently
you can't give a speech

16:53.330 --> 16:55.250
about your humble beginnings
from the grass.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.580
Uh...

16:57.580 --> 16:59.790
Please tell me
you're looking for a mint.

16:59.790 --> 17:01.210
Yes.

17:01.210 --> 17:03.540
I'm looking for the mint
that starts the car.

17:07.580 --> 17:10.080
They must be here
somewhere.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.460
Then why aren't they, Tom?!
Why aren't they?!

17:16.170 --> 17:17.000
Uh...

17:18.500 --> 17:19.960
Do you want to hear
something funny?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.000
Okay, new plan.
We'll do it ourselves.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.290
I'll figure out some food
and do the gift bags.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.710
-You can set up the screen.
-There's not enough time.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.620
Face it, the two of us
can't do everything.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.380
You're right.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.210
I didn't think one Aidan

17:39.210 --> 17:41.080
was more powerful
than six Diazes.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.790
Pulling off a party
in one day?

17:43.790 --> 17:46.500
I guess I was expecting
too much.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.380
I mean,
I know it's a long shot,

17:48.380 --> 17:50.080
me ever becoming
a big-time director,

17:50.080 --> 17:53.040
but I always thought
if I made it,

17:53.040 --> 17:56.000
it'd be because of my family.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.210
Not...

18:12.380 --> 18:17.000
♪ Here we go,
I'm gonna be a big star ♪

18:17.000 --> 18:20.710
♪ Turn it on
like a rock-and-roll guitar ♪

18:20.710 --> 18:24.750
♪ Light up,
let it burn like a big star ♪

18:24.750 --> 18:29.040
♪ Here we go, and it goes
a little something like this ♪

18:29.040 --> 18:33.250
♪ Oh-oh, and it goes
a little something like this ♪

18:33.250 --> 18:35.170
[vocalizing]

18:38.210 --> 18:42.170
♪ And it goes
a little something like this ♪

18:42.170 --> 18:45.250
Getting crowded, Georgie.
make sure they're on the list.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.170
I can't believe
we actually pulled this off.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.170
[chuckles, sighs]

18:50.170 --> 18:51.750
Power of a big family.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.580
Remember this
when you're rich and famous

18:53.580 --> 18:55.620
and need an entourage.

18:55.620 --> 18:59.080
Ethan, look who's here!

18:59.080 --> 19:01.040
Shane Coleman.
Should be on the list.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.250
[laughs] Go!
What are you waiting for!

19:04.250 --> 19:07.210
Dude, so glad
you could make it.

19:07.210 --> 19:08.750
I have anyone sitting
on either side of you

19:08.750 --> 19:11.120
in case you like to spread out,
and if you want

19:11.120 --> 19:12.620
to put your feet up,
I can move people.

19:12.620 --> 19:15.170
Look, I'm just here
to fulfill my obligation.

19:15.170 --> 19:18.080
But I might as well do it
with my feet up.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.170
-Sir?
-Ooh, gift bag.

19:21.170 --> 19:25.210
Oh, glad I'm not late.
I think it looks pretty good.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.250
We really pulled this off,
didn't we?

19:27.250 --> 19:31.040
We? You are not
a part of our "we."

19:31.040 --> 19:33.170
While you were off
doing whatever,

19:33.170 --> 19:36.040
the we was here cleaning,
setting up the party,

19:36.040 --> 19:39.120
and working as a team like
we used to before you came in.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.120
This is just like old times.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.330
You yelling at me,
me not really understanding why.

19:44.330 --> 19:46.620
Of course this is my fault.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.380
I was hoping by bringing you
here to be in our family,

19:49.380 --> 19:51.380
you'd learn a little
something about sharing

19:51.380 --> 19:54.380
and working as a team,
but instead,

19:54.380 --> 19:56.420
you taught them
to be as selfish as you.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.500
Selfish? Is it selfish
for me to be working

19:58.500 --> 20:00.380
on the entertainment
for this party?

20:00.380 --> 20:03.540
Yes! Because Ethan's film
is the entertainment!

20:03.540 --> 20:05.540
That's the whole point
of this thing!

20:05.540 --> 20:08.580
It's supposed to be about Ethan,
not whatever you think is fun!

20:08.580 --> 20:10.540
-Well, I thought--
-It's always all about you.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.380
-I got--
-Do you hear yourself?

20:12.380 --> 20:15.170
-I just wanted--
-There you go again, "I, I, I"!

20:15.170 --> 20:17.170
[truck beeping,
crowd murmuring]

20:17.170 --> 20:19.210
[Shane] I got a surprise
for the party.

20:19.210 --> 20:22.380
-[horn honks]
-A video game truck?

20:22.380 --> 20:24.710
Who's gonna want
to watch Ethan's movie

20:24.710 --> 20:27.170
when there's a truck full
of awesome parked next to it?!

20:27.170 --> 20:29.170
Everyone was working so hard
to make it a great party,

20:29.170 --> 20:30.670
I thought I'd do the same.

20:30.670 --> 20:33.330
I just came up
with a terrible idea.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.250
I'm new at this!

20:35.250 --> 20:37.290
Don't worry,
I'll send them away.

20:37.290 --> 20:41.580
I've gotta get this going.
Lewie, quick, start the speech!

20:43.540 --> 20:46.580
Introducing our film's director,
the person who will one day

20:46.580 --> 20:48.460
let his brothers
live in his pool house,

20:48.460 --> 20:51.170
Mr. Ethan Diaz!

20:51.170 --> 20:56.330
-[cheers and applause]
-Back! Back! Back! Back!

20:56.330 --> 20:59.330
I wanna thank you all
so much for coming--

20:59.330 --> 21:01.500
[grunting]

21:01.500 --> 21:05.330
[all murmuring]

21:05.330 --> 21:07.380
This is the last time
I accept an invite

21:07.380 --> 21:10.000
from people who show up
in my driveway.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.750
[sighs]
Sorry about this weekend.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.290
And thanks for letting me
after last night.

21:28.290 --> 21:29.670
I'm just gonna...

21:34.290 --> 21:36.620
[door opens, closes]

21:36.620 --> 21:38.460
I can't believe
after all that work,

21:38.460 --> 21:40.250
the screening
never even happened.

21:40.250 --> 21:44.330
He made me mad at a game truck.
Who does that?

21:45.500 --> 21:50.120
Look, he even left his lacrosse
mouth guard on our table.

21:50.120 --> 21:53.120
Aw, he'll need that
for his game today.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.290
[scoffs]

21:57.750 --> 21:59.170
[doorbell rings]

22:03.580 --> 22:05.380
Hey, guys.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.670
Oh, man, you were so disgusted
with last night,

22:07.670 --> 22:09.620
you didn't even want
to keep the costume.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.170
I'd love to,
but I brought it back

22:12.170 --> 22:14.380
so you can use it
for the sequel.

22:14.380 --> 22:17.210
I haven't written one yet.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.670
You better get started.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.500
You're gonna have
a lot of new fans

22:20.500 --> 22:23.420
after I give you a shout-out
on my big finale show.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.290
How?

22:25.290 --> 22:27.250
We-- we never even screened
the movie.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.380
You know that kid you were
yelling at last night?

22:29.380 --> 22:31.420
He chased me down
and wouldn't let me leave

22:31.420 --> 22:33.250
till I took the DVD from him.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.380
I get why
you were yelling at him.

22:35.380 --> 22:38.540
-He's kind of pushy.
-Pushy, yes. I agree.

22:38.540 --> 22:43.040
Slow down, you showed up
in my driveway in a zombie suit.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.120
But I'm glad he was pushy.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.580
If not, I never
would've discovered

22:47.580 --> 22:49.580
a great up-and-coming
director.

22:49.580 --> 22:52.080

22:52.080 --> 22:54.290
♪ And it's everything ♪

22:54.290 --> 22:58.500
♪ You wanted to be ♪

22:58.500 --> 23:01.000
♪ It's a new day... ♪

23:01.000 --> 23:03.420
We know your final
lacrosse game is today.

23:03.420 --> 23:06.620
-Thought you might need a ride.
-And a cheering section.

23:06.620 --> 23:11.380
-[all cheer]
-[chanting] Aidan! Aidan!

23:11.380 --> 23:13.250
We're good at loud.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.420
Aidan! Aidan! Aidan!

23:15.420 --> 23:17.420
[Harley] I guess Ethan making
a great movie

23:17.420 --> 23:19.330
wasn't the biggest surprise
of the weekend.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.120
The real twist?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.420
Aidan turned out
to be the good guy.

23:22.420 --> 23:24.460
Lewie, please,
make room for Aidan.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.460
So, yeah,
our premiere fell apart,

23:26.460 --> 23:29.290
but we still got
our movie-perfect ending.

23:29.290 --> 23:30.500
Come on, Aidan, get in!
