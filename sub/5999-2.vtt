Somewhere in Germany, Hitler's

00:16.403 --> 00:18.153
I need you to look at something.

You didn't hear this from

Is your mother still alive, Frank?

He's gone and he's never coming back.

He gave me his blessing.

00:57.122 --> 00:58.683

02:13.270 --> 02:16.354
Our source inside Heisenberg's lab,

02:16.356 --> 02:20.820
the only reason we knew the
Nazis were on the brink of a bomb.

02:22.394 --> 02:25.780
You really think I'm the
reason your German spy is dead?

02:26.104 --> 02:29.734
I think you're 10 feet underground...

02:32.154 --> 02:33.955
and I am the only living soul

02:33.957 --> 02:36.324
<i>who knows where you are.</i>

02:36.326 --> 02:39.627
I think that makes me
the hand that feeds you

02:39.629 --> 02:41.496
and the hand that taketh away

02:41.498 --> 02:46.084
until all you've got
left is time and space.

02:46.922 --> 02:48.957
And then I take those.

02:49.482 --> 02:52.483
<i>And what's left is the truth.</i>

02:54.226 --> 02:57.929
Read up. Get to know the
man you sentenced to death.

02:59.064 --> 03:00.982
What are you?

03:00.984 --> 03:03.651
A bureaucrat with a gun.

03:03.653 --> 03:05.820
You know absolutely nothing.

03:05.822 --> 03:07.689
You've got the paperwork to back it up.

03:07.691 --> 03:11.276
In 1936, you took a leave of absence
from the University of Chicago

03:11.278 --> 03:14.195
to attend the Nobel ceremony
of your friend Carl Anderson.

03:14.197 --> 03:17.532
Three days later you boarded
the <i> Kronprinsessen Hilde</i>

03:17.534 --> 03:19.868
to Hamburg, Germany, used a fake name.

03:19.870 --> 03:22.420
Then you traveled by rail to Leipzig,

03:22.422 --> 03:24.539
paid cash at the Park Hotel.

03:24.541 --> 03:26.999
Stayed two months.

03:27.627 --> 03:32.597
Since then you've taken great
pains to conceal that trip...

03:32.599 --> 03:35.934
falsifying your army background affidavit,

03:35.936 --> 03:38.386
for example.

03:38.622 --> 03:39.955
That is what I know.

03:44.036 --> 03:45.370
<i>Make it last.</i>

03:45.529 --> 03:48.071
I'll be back in a couple of days.

03:48.732 --> 03:50.648

when I lied to you,

06:23.970 --> 06:27.522
it was only to protect
you and protect Callie.

06:29.934 --> 06:31.726
<i>It's not important now.</i>

06:31.728 --> 06:34.479
The main point is...

06:34.481 --> 06:36.614
you missed something.

06:38.233 --> 06:40.952
- What did I miss?
- <i> The first lie.</i>

06:45.040 --> 06:46.457

07:19.825 --> 07:21.744
Yeah, from you.

07:22.362 --> 07:26.914
Student stands up in a

07:26.916 --> 07:29.951
"Planets, stars, gravity...

they're all lies.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.292
<i>"What's the turtle standing on?"</i>

07:40.764 --> 07:42.463
"Oh, but don't you see?

07:42.465 --> 07:47.685
Both: It's turtles all the way down."

07:50.856 --> 07:54.275
<i>I guess we all need a turtle
to stand on sometimes.</i>

07:54.277 --> 07:57.028
<i>There are so few

07:57.030 --> 07:59.063
<i>And life.</i>

07:59.065 --> 08:02.066

- Variables.

08:03.619 --> 08:04.986
Now these...

08:05.761 --> 08:08.345
these variables aren't intuitive.

08:08.497 --> 08:10.825
In English or in German.

08:10.827 --> 08:12.293

15:42.435 --> 15:44.218
Fresh off the boat?

15:44.220 --> 15:48.022
Clean hands. No <i> labor
vos liberabit</i> for you.

15:48.024 --> 15:51.308
"Work will set you free"?

15:51.310 --> 15:54.061
It's not helping the guys out there.

15:54.063 --> 15:56.197
College man, eh?

15:56.199 --> 15:59.483
Yeah, that'll come in real handy in Tosa.

15:59.485 --> 16:02.653
Tosa? What is that,
the name of this prison?

16:02.655 --> 16:04.905
<i>The name of the town we're in?</i>

16:04.907 --> 16:06.374
- What? Where are we?
- Back!

16:06.376 --> 16:09.894
What the... Jesus. Never... never mind.

16:09.896 --> 16:11.796
(Mumbling)

16:11.798 --> 16:13.414
Hey, come back!

16:13.416 --> 16:16.500
Come back! I need to make a phone call!

16:52.902 --> 16:54.570
Man: <i>I figured it out.</i>

16:57.462 --> 16:58.962
You're Houdini, right?

16:58.987 --> 17:00.821
<i>The guy who appeared
out of thin air.</i>

17:00.846 --> 17:02.292
<i>We heard about you.</i>

17:03.997 --> 17:06.464
You really don't know why we're here.

17:06.778 --> 17:08.611
<i>I saw Houdini when I was 15.</i>

17:08.636 --> 17:11.137
I don't suppose that you can pick a lock...

17:11.138 --> 17:12.672
<i>You didn't tell me.</i>

17:12.674 --> 17:15.007
What is Tosa?

17:17.594 --> 17:19.762
It's a province in Japan.

17:19.763 --> 17:21.931
They breed fighting dogs.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.835
They're the finest in the world.

17:24.402 --> 17:26.008
(Sighs)

17:26.354 --> 17:28.771
The guards in this prison
don't have any dogs.

17:28.773 --> 17:32.274
<i>But, uh, when you're bored
and you're a betting man,</i>

17:32.276 --> 17:34.210
<i>you work with what you got.</i>

17:34.212 --> 17:35.828
And what you got here is a bunch of guys

17:35.830 --> 17:38.027
who don't, strictly speaking, exist.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.783
So why not throw 'em
into an empty cellblock,

17:41.921 --> 17:43.536
see who survives?

17:44.603 --> 17:46.354
That's insane.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.041
They can't just expect us to...

17:49.043 --> 17:50.793
Kill or be killed?

17:50.795 --> 17:53.002
If the dogs won't fight,

17:53.027 --> 17:55.873
heat up the cage. They,
uh... they have their ways.

17:55.898 --> 17:57.444
You'll see.

17:58.224 --> 17:59.418
(Exhales)

17:59.723 --> 18:03.125
Nobody can force us to murder each other.

18:04.399 --> 18:06.700
Usually they throw a
white guy in with a Jap.

18:06.725 --> 18:08.258
<i>(Frank sighs)</i>

18:08.283 --> 18:09.866
The house always wins.

18:10.064 --> 18:12.064
<i>(Piano playing faintly)</i>

18:17.091 --> 18:19.342
Is that a radio?

18:19.907 --> 18:21.560
Hmm?

18:22.477 --> 18:24.126
Where?

18:25.912 --> 18:27.496
Never mind.

18:29.220 --> 18:31.188
Listen...

18:31.636 --> 18:33.819
How long have we been here?

18:35.473 --> 18:37.329
- 12 hours.
- 12 hours,

18:37.329 --> 18:39.274
you could've brained me anytime.

18:39.394 --> 18:42.094
So the way I see it, we're
already beating the odds.

18:42.096 --> 18:43.846
We just have to trust each other.

18:43.848 --> 18:45.239
(Scoffs)

18:45.650 --> 18:47.316
That's your plan, Houdini?

18:47.318 --> 18:49.318
- Trust?
- No.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.896
Game theory.

18:51.489 --> 18:54.023
Trust is the strategy.

18:54.691 --> 18:58.445
The plan is escape.

19:00.363 --> 19:01.560
(laughs)

19:02.009 --> 19:03.091
(exhales)

19:05.025 --> 19:07.477
I was 13.

19:07.643 --> 19:09.025
Excuse me?

19:09.050 --> 19:11.718
The first time I saw Houdini.

19:12.260 --> 19:13.955
<i>He did the milk can escape.</i>

19:14.629 --> 19:16.929
Two summers later he came back

19:17.546 --> 19:19.662
and that's when I
figured out how he did it.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.935
<i>Right before he went in,</i>

19:22.937 --> 19:26.522
his, um... his wife came
onstage, do you remember?

19:28.308 --> 19:31.551
Well, she kissed the key into his mouth.

19:32.029 --> 19:34.530
<i>Right in front of everybody.</i>

19:37.150 --> 19:38.951
(sighs) The wife.

19:38.953 --> 19:40.307
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:40.955 --> 19:45.324
<i>You see, most solutions,
they hide in plain sight.</i>

19:46.477 --> 19:49.345
I don't plan on doing any killing today.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.182
Or dying.

19:54.601 --> 19:55.852
Do you?

20:05.541 --> 20:07.626
Beuker. Joseph Beuker.

20:08.615 --> 20:10.616
Charlie Isaacs.

20:12.369 --> 20:13.753
(Car door shuts)

20:13.755 --> 20:15.755
- <i> (horn honks)</i>
- Hey, kiddo.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.006
Daddy!

20:17.008 --> 20:18.925
Abby: How was your day?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.761
You know those Chinese circus acts?

20:21.763 --> 20:23.129
Guy juggling plates,

20:23.131 --> 20:26.215
you think the whole dinner set's
gonna come crashing down on his head?

20:26.505 --> 20:28.005
<i>Sit.</i>

20:29.720 --> 20:31.888
I gotta be back in an hour.

20:31.890 --> 20:33.752
Sorry.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.858
What do you have to go back to?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.612
Sign the pay slips.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.398
Get my requisitions rejected by the Army.

20:43.112 --> 20:44.734
Repeat.

20:45.946 --> 20:50.031
Have you, uh, picked out a
color for the nursery yet?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.495
You're building a weapon.

20:55.497 --> 20:58.464
- I wanna know what kind.
- Abby.

20:58.466 --> 21:02.218
- We said no more secrets.
- It's not my secret.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.337
I took a vow.

21:04.970 --> 21:07.137
You've broken other vows.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.510
There are 20-year-old graduate students

21:10.512 --> 21:11.727
who know why we're here.

21:12.299 --> 21:14.466
Boys. Helen Prins knows.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.272
You said this baby was a new leaf.

21:24.441 --> 21:26.913
And I won't go back to
the way it was before.

21:27.662 --> 21:32.448
Playing make-believe like
you're a teacher or salesman

21:32.576 --> 21:34.700
and I'm Betty Crocker.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.218
Do you remember...

21:52.220 --> 21:55.104
when we had dinner at that, uh...

21:55.106 --> 21:56.939
that Italian place in Central Square?

21:56.941 --> 22:00.393
I was bouncing off the walls
'cause a guy named Otto Hahn

22:00.395 --> 22:02.478
split the atom.

22:03.564 --> 22:04.947
It's call...

22:08.151 --> 22:11.324
It's called an atomic chain reaction.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.458
(Chatter)

22:19.880 --> 22:22.031
<i>(wind howling)</i>

22:22.033 --> 22:25.434
So Liza actually says that
she's heard from Frank?

22:25.436 --> 22:26.919
I mean, she can't stand the Army.

22:26.921 --> 22:29.005
Why would she cover for 'em?

22:29.007 --> 22:30.018
I don't know.

22:30.018 --> 22:31.748
Maybe she's in cahoots with Charlie Isaacs.

22:31.759 --> 22:34.977
Maybe, uh... maybe they bumped
off Frank for the life insurance.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.336
Well, I don't like Isaacs any
better than the rest of you.

22:37.361 --> 22:39.398
He makes Richard III look like Richard II.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.852
But, you know, maybe Frank
really was transferred.

22:42.854 --> 22:44.520
You wanna tell us what we're
doing here then, Duchess?

22:44.522 --> 22:47.189
We're looking for Hitler's W.A.M.D.s.

22:47.191 --> 22:48.658
Five miles from the Hill?

22:48.660 --> 22:51.494
Actually, we're five miles above the Earth

22:51.496 --> 22:53.029
in German air space.

22:53.031 --> 22:54.697
Have you been eating Fritz's mushrooms?

22:54.699 --> 22:57.416
It's the lowest altitude a
surveillance plane can fly.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.919
We're recreating the
same conditions laterally.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.255
Radioactive particles
ruin photographic film.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.957
We're gonna mount those plates
on posts downwind of the Hill.

23:04.959 --> 23:06.342
Well, if the film gets exposed...

23:06.344 --> 23:07.960
So all you need to find a German reactor

23:07.962 --> 23:10.079
is an airplane and a roll of Kodak.

23:10.081 --> 23:11.914
- Quick and dirty.
- Just like Helen.

23:11.916 --> 23:14.517
So we're following Issacs' orders?

23:14.519 --> 23:16.102
We're not doing it for Charlie.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.997
We're doing what Frank would want us to do.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.053
Chasing wild geese in a
desert while another team

23:20.078 --> 23:22.358
signs its name on a gadget we invented.

23:22.360 --> 23:23.776
We're doing the work we're assigned

23:23.778 --> 23:26.062
better than anyone else.

23:26.064 --> 23:27.694
Frank: <i>Beuker!</i>

23:28.399 --> 23:30.983
These are telephone wires out here.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.570
I don't think they're gonna
give you your phone call,

23:34.572 --> 23:36.572
Charlie.

23:37.004 --> 23:40.005
Pretty sure they already found
a substitute for your math class.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.296
<i>You were talking about game theory.</i>

23:43.298 --> 23:45.631
<i>I assume you're not a plumber.</i>

23:45.633 --> 23:48.301
I teach calculus.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.469
- <i> Oh.</i>
- College.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.972
<i>Like recognizes like. I'm history.</i>

23:52.974 --> 23:54.840
Fisk University. Where did you educate

23:54.842 --> 23:56.892
the future nonvoters of America?

23:56.894 --> 23:59.428
I've been chased out of half
the schools in the Ivy League.

23:59.430 --> 24:01.764
You know, there's gotta be some kind of...

24:01.766 --> 24:04.934
emergency telephone box
somewhere in this building.

24:04.936 --> 24:07.436
<i>"Isaacs."</i>

24:07.438 --> 24:11.157
Known a lot of Jewish math
professors over the years.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.825
Christian, actually.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.578
I was born that way. I'll die an atheist.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.447
Ah, we've got that in common, too.

24:18.449 --> 24:21.534
(Exhales) A couple atheist teachers,

24:21.536 --> 24:22.918
rational,

24:22.920 --> 24:25.371
happy fellow travelers so far.

24:25.373 --> 24:27.423
So what is it... what is it...

24:29.292 --> 24:32.378
What? What is what?

24:32.380 --> 24:34.180
(Exhales)

24:34.182 --> 24:37.183
They throw fellas in Tosa who
would want to kill each other.

24:37.694 --> 24:39.635
They paired us up for a reason.

24:39.637 --> 24:42.805
- <i> (Piano playing faintly)</i>
- Charlie?

24:45.475 --> 24:48.110
You really don't hear that?

24:50.697 --> 24:52.285
Hear what?

24:52.817 --> 24:56.152
It's the Mourning Cantata
for King Frederick.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.627
Losing my mind.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.211
Well, you've come to the right place.

25:05.853 --> 25:07.803
How's an American citizen

25:07.828 --> 25:10.484
end up in a hole like this?

25:10.918 --> 25:12.885
(Clears throat)

25:12.887 --> 25:15.421
Just look enough like Yamamoto
to piss off the Rotary Club.

25:15.423 --> 25:18.090
Or just look like a plain old white fella

25:18.092 --> 25:19.975
who went to the wrong meeting.

25:20.705 --> 25:22.614
Well, did you?

25:22.730 --> 25:24.263
Go to the wrong meeting?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.816
I believed in free thought

25:26.818 --> 25:29.018
and I made the mistake of practicing it

25:29.020 --> 25:31.103
in a classroom.

25:31.105 --> 25:32.938
How'd you really wind up here?

25:32.940 --> 25:35.324
- <i> (Metal clanging)</i>
- Hey.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.692
<i>Hey.</i>

25:36.694 --> 25:38.611
<i>Hey!</i>

25:38.613 --> 25:39.745
<i>Listen to me!</i>

25:39.747 --> 25:42.415
Call... call Santa Fe 332...

25:42.417 --> 25:44.533
God damn it!

25:44.535 --> 25:46.702
(Panting)

25:50.373 --> 25:53.959
Hey, uh, how long since you ate?

25:54.715 --> 25:56.178
Yesterday.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.465
You? Uh-uh-uh!

26:00.437 --> 26:01.717
I heard about this.

26:01.719 --> 26:03.052
<i>They drug the food.</i>

26:03.054 --> 26:06.555
Sometimes one tray, sometimes both.

26:06.557 --> 26:09.730
Deal one of us an advantage, see?

26:11.108 --> 26:13.242
- Imbalance.
- That's crazy.

26:15.245 --> 26:18.414
It can't be that easy getting
two strangers to kill each other.

26:18.416 --> 26:21.867
Well, you obviously don't teach history.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.036
Okay.

26:24.038 --> 26:26.170
So we both eat

26:26.374 --> 26:28.424
from both trays at the same time.

26:28.426 --> 26:30.125
That way if something happens,

26:30.127 --> 26:32.114
it happens to both of us, okay?

26:32.483 --> 26:34.145
Yeah.

26:43.223 --> 26:45.474
<i>(Cover clatters)</i>

27:01.658 --> 27:04.376
<i>(crickets chirping)</i>

27:04.378 --> 27:07.129
Picked the wrong desert. I
bet it's warm in the Sahara.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.301
It's freezing. How much longer?

27:12.303 --> 27:14.219
Six more plates. 90 minutes.

27:15.221 --> 27:17.348
Who's got a spooky story?

27:18.642 --> 27:21.643
I suppose I've got a spook story.

27:24.513 --> 27:26.648
You know that G-2 guy with the glasses

27:26.650 --> 27:27.899
always skulking around bushes

27:27.901 --> 27:29.317
with a cola bottle in his hand?

27:29.319 --> 27:31.236
Fritz: <i>I hate that guy.</i>

27:31.238 --> 27:33.326
He vanished

27:33.574 --> 27:35.690
into the ether two weeks ago.

27:36.403 --> 27:39.488
<i>They found his badge by
the side of the road.</i>

27:39.862 --> 27:41.446
<i>Much the worse for wear.</i>

27:43.199 --> 27:45.867
- Where did you hear that?
- <i> My secret informant.</i>

27:45.869 --> 27:48.503
Helen: <i>Whichever WAC
he's boffing now.</i>

27:48.505 --> 27:50.090
<i>(music playing)</i>

27:50.115 --> 27:52.568
Fritz: <i>We're looking
for the Nazi version</i>

27:52.593 --> 27:54.092
<i>of the Manhattan Project, right?</i>

27:54.094 --> 27:55.894
<i>We're basically looking
for our Nazi... </i>

27:55.896 --> 27:58.430
(gasping, choking)

27:58.432 --> 28:00.348
Fritz: <i>Nazi-Meeks, Nazi-Crosley... </i>

28:00.373 --> 28:02.373
Helen: <i>What's the opposite
of a drunk English physicist?</i>

28:02.398 --> 28:04.865
Crosley: <i>A sober Irish priest!
And good luck finding one!</i>

28:04.890 --> 28:06.577
<i>(men laughing)</i>

28:06.602 --> 28:08.152
Fritz: <i>I gotta empty the tank.</i>

28:09.641 --> 28:11.341
Uh, if some guy comes back,

28:11.672 --> 28:15.063
looks like me, handsome,
but with no mustache?

28:15.088 --> 28:17.972
That's Nazi-Fritz. Don't trust him!

28:18.252 --> 28:21.253
<i>(Men grunting)</i>

28:21.255 --> 28:22.866
(scraping)

28:23.175 --> 28:24.458
- Open it.
- Where?

28:27.452 --> 28:29.403
(Both grunting)

28:34.050 --> 28:35.992
<i>(trunk lid closes)</i>

28:36.395 --> 28:38.179
- (retches)
- Man: <i> You won't see me again.</i>

28:38.556 --> 28:41.373
When the time comes,
someone will contact you.

28:41.983 --> 28:45.551
He'll have the other half of this.

28:52.535 --> 28:54.253
<i>(Fritz screams) Holy shit!</i>

28:54.622 --> 28:56.788
- What?
- <i> Come here!</i>

28:56.790 --> 28:59.157
<i>Somebody shot it.</i>

29:03.083 --> 29:04.781
Probably target practice.

29:04.806 --> 29:06.840
Can't be a good omen.

29:08.584 --> 29:10.669
We should bury him.

29:11.422 --> 29:12.912
Uh...

29:14.508 --> 29:17.226
Pretty sure the bugs have
it under control, pal.

29:17.228 --> 29:19.811
So we just leave him out here to rot?

29:19.813 --> 29:22.295
That's what the Nazis would do.

29:22.933 --> 29:26.348
We're... we're decent human beings.

29:26.648 --> 29:27.938
You all right?

29:29.990 --> 29:32.068
I don't know what we're doing here anymore.

29:32.826 --> 29:35.694
Helen: <i>'Cause the guy who's
supposed to tell us isn't here.</i>

29:37.780 --> 29:40.782
<i>(brakes squealing)</i>

30:51.126 --> 30:52.926
Hey, Beu... Beuker!

30:52.951 --> 30:55.485
Beuker! Beuker, bring me the gun!

30:56.528 --> 30:59.230
<i>Thought we had a
gentleman's agreement.</i>

30:59.232 --> 31:00.898
<i>No gunplay.</i>

31:00.900 --> 31:04.150
Well, there's... there's
a telephone box in here.

31:06.455 --> 31:08.239
What's this?

31:08.241 --> 31:11.542
- Some kind of boiler room?
- We can shoot this lock off.

31:11.544 --> 31:13.377
Right.

31:13.379 --> 31:15.413
No, no. C...

31:15.415 --> 31:18.165
Beu... Beuker, come here.

31:19.148 --> 31:20.630
Beuker!

31:20.887 --> 31:24.589
Even if there is a phone in there,
I doubt they've paid the bill.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.280
If there's any kind of live
wire, I could rig something up.

31:27.305 --> 31:30.306
I've got practical experience
with that sort of stuff.

31:30.308 --> 31:33.943
(Chuckles) Sounds a little
Buck Rogers to me, Charlie.

31:33.945 --> 31:35.478
<i>Who's doing the shooting?</i>

31:35.480 --> 31:37.313
Whoever's the best shot.

31:37.315 --> 31:39.699
I carried a service
revolver in the last war.

31:39.701 --> 31:41.360
Oh.

31:41.736 --> 31:43.486
So I guess I ought to give you the gun, eh?

31:44.952 --> 31:46.837
Look, we have a shot.

31:46.862 --> 31:50.363
Literally, one shot that we
can use to try and escape.

31:50.795 --> 31:53.579
<i>(Piano playing faintly)</i>

32:00.888 --> 32:02.555
You're hearing it again?

32:03.466 --> 32:05.341
You can hear it.

32:05.343 --> 32:07.810
(Chuckles) No, your head's a mess,

32:07.812 --> 32:10.596
but, uh, when you
mentioned the piece earlier,

32:10.598 --> 32:12.231
I-I was surprised.

32:12.233 --> 32:14.319
That's Johann Adolph Scheibe.

32:14.344 --> 32:15.426
So?

32:15.486 --> 32:17.403
How do you even know Scheibe?

32:17.405 --> 32:18.988
- Do you play?
- <i> No.</i>

32:18.990 --> 32:21.274
No, somebody I used to know,

32:21.276 --> 32:23.326
she played him a lot.

32:23.328 --> 32:26.445
(Sighs) Okay, you want the gun, Charlie?

32:26.447 --> 32:29.949
- I'll give it to you.
- All right. Fine, good, give it to me.

32:29.951 --> 32:31.701
But I want something back.

32:31.703 --> 32:33.252
The truth.

32:33.254 --> 32:35.205
Who you really are.

32:35.757 --> 32:37.387
I understand...

32:38.209 --> 32:40.259
why you're not admitting it, mind you.

32:40.261 --> 32:42.044
Scheibe was, uh...

32:42.046 --> 32:45.681
Bach's only real critic, you know?

32:45.683 --> 32:48.851
<i>He found Bach abstract.</i>

32:48.853 --> 32:52.431
Degenerate. Like the
Negroes and their jazz.

32:53.387 --> 32:56.025
You must know where Scheibe's experiencing

32:56.027 --> 32:57.560
a resurgence right now.

32:59.780 --> 33:03.528
The same country, the
only country, mind you,

33:04.118 --> 33:07.203
that guarantees protection
of the middle class

33:07.205 --> 33:09.655
against unions and immigrants...

33:10.907 --> 33:13.960
parasitic financial schemes.

33:17.214 --> 33:19.832
- What, Germany?
- Yeah.

33:21.635 --> 33:23.586
Not a lot of Scheibe fans in America.

33:23.588 --> 33:26.005
Can't even find his recordings
here, can you, Charlie?

33:28.642 --> 33:30.843
Just a plain old white fella

33:30.845 --> 33:32.514
who went to the wrong meeting.

33:35.265 --> 33:36.602
"Isaacs."

33:37.101 --> 33:40.353
Christianized from "Heidrich," I'll bet?

33:40.355 --> 33:41.938
(Exhales)

33:42.149 --> 33:45.567
You got High Prussian blood, don't you?

33:50.030 --> 33:51.947
You're a Nazi.

33:53.583 --> 33:57.578
Y-you're an American Nazi.

33:58.498 --> 34:00.465
Have I misjudged you?

34:00.989 --> 34:02.466
So what...

34:02.824 --> 34:04.941
what if I had been a Jew?

34:05.431 --> 34:08.982
What, would you have bashed
my skull in that first night?

34:10.016 --> 34:11.998
I part with Hitler there.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.583
I have no complaints
with the Jewish people,

34:15.585 --> 34:16.835
<i>per se.</i>

34:16.838 --> 34:19.097
I ask only for some...

34:19.791 --> 34:24.543
open debate about their
effect on their host cultures.

34:24.545 --> 34:26.963
You've seen it in academia,

34:26.965 --> 34:30.266
the conspiracy against good Aryans like us.

34:30.268 --> 34:33.052
You twisted son of a bitch.

34:35.438 --> 34:37.473
So who played Scheibe for you?

34:38.188 --> 34:40.059
<i>Some old flame?</i>

34:41.645 --> 34:43.980
Did you get your heart
broken by a German girl?

34:43.982 --> 34:46.315
Is that where all this anger's coming from?

34:48.771 --> 34:51.237
Where's my anger coming from?

34:51.239 --> 34:54.040
Trust me, Joe. I know the
Nazis a lot better than you do.

34:54.042 --> 34:56.375
<i>You're a gang of killers</i>

34:56.377 --> 34:58.461
<i>who brainwashed their own people.</i>

34:58.892 --> 35:01.380
Why am I angry?

35:01.382 --> 35:04.383
- Charlie.
- My name is not Charlie.

35:20.017 --> 35:21.448
Hey.

35:22.236 --> 35:23.853
Joey just went down.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.855
He was beside himself.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.074
He found a cow skull in the cupboard.

35:28.076 --> 35:30.359
Did you know that Liza Winter
kept bones in the house?

35:30.361 --> 35:32.411
Well, she's a biologist.

35:32.413 --> 35:34.413
If you saw Darwin's cupboard,

35:34.415 --> 35:36.844
you'd think he was a mass murderer.

35:51.681 --> 35:53.382
What's the matter?

35:54.530 --> 35:57.448
Is there a problem with the... gadget?

35:57.638 --> 36:00.045
Uh... no.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.082
Well...

36:03.111 --> 36:05.240
not ours. (exhales)

36:05.446 --> 36:07.480
Hitler's gadget, then?

36:13.737 --> 36:16.872
The Army's gonna invade
Europe, and when they get there,

36:16.874 --> 36:20.242
they need to know how to
find the German project.

36:20.244 --> 36:23.546
We have intelligence from
inside the Nazi project.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.831
Information about how Heisenberg

36:25.833 --> 36:28.584
and Strassmann and Hahn are
actually building their gadget.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.336
Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?

36:30.338 --> 36:32.138
It would be...

36:32.140 --> 36:34.526
if I was allowed to tell my guys about it.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.726
They're working on the
problem with a brain hemisphere

36:37.728 --> 36:39.178
<i>tied behind their back.</i>

36:40.814 --> 36:42.681
I know what I would do

36:43.287 --> 36:46.402
<i>if I were the Nazis
looking for this project.</i>

36:46.404 --> 36:48.821
Yeah, what's that?

36:49.547 --> 36:51.857
I'd come after you.

36:52.666 --> 36:56.829
Say you wanted to end a baseball season.

36:58.281 --> 36:59.748
You could look for the stadiums,

36:59.750 --> 37:01.333
try and shut them all down.

37:01.730 --> 37:03.619
Or you could just...

37:03.621 --> 37:06.139
- get rid of the New York Yankees.
- Abby.

37:07.386 --> 37:10.259
What you're talking
about, it's complicated.

37:10.261 --> 37:13.549
- The... the German physicists they're...
- Trying to get rid of us.

37:13.574 --> 37:16.275
Friends. Or they were
friends of Oppenheimer's.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.549
Of the senior staff.

37:17.574 --> 37:19.541
These guys, they...

37:19.566 --> 37:21.850
They all came up together.

37:22.436 --> 37:23.830
If...

37:24.892 --> 37:27.560
If the Nazi gadget goes off...

37:29.729 --> 37:31.530
will they spare our friends?

37:36.286 --> 37:39.071
You must have photographs
of the German scientists.

37:40.957 --> 37:44.577
Their home addresses. The names
of their wives and children.

37:47.130 --> 37:49.048
Give those to the Army.

38:02.012 --> 38:03.679
(Pants)

38:03.681 --> 38:06.849
You can't even see the irony.

38:06.851 --> 38:10.936
Sitting in an American concentration camp,

38:10.938 --> 38:15.608
but you think the
Germans are monsters, huh?

38:15.610 --> 38:17.693
Hitler's more merciful than you think.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.411
Not the first word that comes to mind.

38:19.413 --> 38:22.531
No? Any second, all this,

38:22.533 --> 38:26.118
this prison, this country, this life

38:26.120 --> 38:28.852
could just, poof! Go away.

38:29.257 --> 38:31.790
- What, more Houdini?
- <i> The wonder weapon.</i>

38:31.792 --> 38:34.793
Hitler has a device that could
bring the world to its knees,

38:34.795 --> 38:37.630
but he doesn't use it 'cause he's merciful.

38:39.516 --> 38:40.933
It's called a sun gun.

38:40.935 --> 38:43.102
It's a heliobeam

38:43.104 --> 38:47.223
that can make an ocean boil
or a continent disappear.

38:47.225 --> 38:50.142
Yeah. Last year it was the freeze ray.

38:50.144 --> 38:52.027
The year before that the death ray.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.063
Germany's a nation of liars.

38:54.065 --> 38:57.399
Says the man who lies about his own name.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.013
<i>You don't look too
good, Houdini. Huh?</i>

39:01.038 --> 39:02.538
<i>Heatstroke?</i>

39:02.540 --> 39:05.658
Or are you hearing your
phantom music again?

39:07.123 --> 39:09.074
You know, I've been to Germany.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.214
Their wonder weapon is propaganda.

39:12.216 --> 39:15.551
They could convince a parent
to eat their own child.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.887
Oh, my God, what did she do to you?

39:18.889 --> 39:21.223
- Who?
- This girlfriend?

39:21.225 --> 39:22.758
Your Nazi love.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.227
This mysterious FrÃ¤ulein

39:25.229 --> 39:27.896
who played Scheibe concertos for you.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.932
She wasn't my goddamn girlfriend!

39:36.690 --> 39:38.657
(Panting)

39:40.360 --> 39:41.443
No.

39:42.808 --> 39:44.893
She was your mother.

39:45.333 --> 39:46.865
(Exhales)

39:49.502 --> 39:51.337
Son of a bitch.

39:52.672 --> 39:54.373
Son of a bitch.

39:56.009 --> 39:58.043
Is your mother German?

40:01.464 --> 40:03.299
- <i> (Lock clangs)</i>
- Hey!

40:05.602 --> 40:06.885
Hey!

40:09.317 --> 40:11.656
No! Hey, please!

40:11.942 --> 40:13.192
Hello?!

40:15.562 --> 40:16.645
It's locked.

40:22.869 --> 40:24.236
Tosa.

40:35.481 --> 40:38.815
- We're both gonna die in here, aren't we?
-<i> (Piano playing faintly)</i>

40:41.869 --> 40:45.072
What temperature does
a man's blood boil at?

40:49.163 --> 40:50.831
Still Scheibe?

40:54.999 --> 40:56.466
Where is she now?

40:56.762 --> 40:58.846
Your mother.

40:59.266 --> 41:01.299
<i>I barely knew her.</i>

41:03.019 --> 41:05.771
My parents met through a service.

41:07.357 --> 41:10.809
Isolated bachelors on farms in the Midwest.

41:10.811 --> 41:13.812
And she was from Germany.

41:13.814 --> 41:15.530
Leipzig.

41:16.218 --> 41:18.097
A musical prodigy.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.154
From Leipzig to the Midwest

41:22.156 --> 41:24.072
<i>And then back again.</i>

41:24.074 --> 41:27.909
She was gone before I was seven years old.

41:27.911 --> 41:30.314
All I remember is this woman.

41:32.632 --> 41:34.071
No.

41:34.301 --> 41:36.468
No, this young girl...

41:36.953 --> 41:38.510
crying.

41:41.140 --> 41:43.425
And the... the piano

41:43.793 --> 41:46.344
every night after bedtime.

41:48.514 --> 41:51.183
And then one night there was no piano.

41:53.352 --> 41:55.640
She just disappeared.

41:57.217 --> 41:59.157
You never saw her again.

41:59.729 --> 42:02.194
No, I did.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.663
I did, I saw her.

42:05.915 --> 42:07.866
I saw her one last time.

42:07.868 --> 42:09.451
1936.

42:11.454 --> 42:12.788
You found her?

42:13.873 --> 42:15.507
<i>She was... </i>

42:15.509 --> 42:17.592
<i>a musician. Finally.</i>

42:17.594 --> 42:20.095
<i>A concert pianist underwritten
by the government.</i>

42:20.097 --> 42:23.515
It took me 30 years, 3,000 miles,

42:23.876 --> 42:26.101
a boat, a plane,

42:26.683 --> 42:28.261
and a leave of absence.

42:29.675 --> 42:32.668
<i>I went into her dressing room</i>

42:32.693 --> 42:34.359
<i>to introduce myself.</i>

42:39.526 --> 42:41.860
She called the Gestapo on me.

42:42.152 --> 42:44.903
Oh, God.

42:44.905 --> 42:46.606
<i>Beukner,</i>

42:47.074 --> 42:49.708
<i>do you know why I
am telling you this?</i>

42:52.044 --> 42:53.995
Because it's the truth.

42:55.581 --> 42:57.883
What do you get for winning Tosa?

43:00.219 --> 43:02.721
<i>They say the winner goes free.</i>

43:02.723 --> 43:04.339
Right.

43:04.887 --> 43:07.805
If you get out of here and I don't...

43:09.562 --> 43:14.232
I want you to call Santa Fe 33200.

43:14.234 --> 43:16.852
<i>I want you to tell them that Magpie</i>

43:17.718 --> 43:19.654
is our work.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.107
It's not theirs.

43:24.076 --> 43:27.445
Tell them to look for the... the letters.

43:30.144 --> 43:31.928
Not the number...

43:35.872 --> 43:37.422
Houdini?

43:38.708 --> 43:40.125
<i>Charlie?</i>

43:42.461 --> 43:44.462
Oh, hey.

43:48.134 --> 43:49.601
Charlie.

43:50.655 --> 43:51.772
Hey.

43:51.884 --> 43:53.934
(Beuker grunts)

43:54.358 --> 43:55.974
(groans)

43:55.976 --> 43:57.726
(pants)

44:09.789 --> 44:11.289
What?

44:11.291 --> 44:13.124
It's a...

44:13.126 --> 44:14.743
This is a fake.

44:14.745 --> 44:16.661
It's...

44:18.631 --> 44:20.409
It's a game.

44:20.717 --> 44:22.500
(Sighs)

44:22.502 --> 44:24.135
Uncle.

44:24.137 --> 44:26.254
(Metal squeaks)

44:39.151 --> 44:41.099
I believe you, Frank.

44:41.655 --> 44:43.188
(Gate clangs)

44:56.669 --> 44:58.703
Where is Avram Fisher?

45:03.694 --> 45:05.343
What... what is this?

45:05.345 --> 45:08.380
The man from Washington
who gave you this file.

45:08.382 --> 45:10.298
Where is he?

45:12.602 --> 45:14.635
Who... who the hell are you?

45:15.138 --> 45:17.806
The United States of America.

45:19.892 --> 45:23.194
There... there's no Tosa.

45:24.313 --> 45:25.883
Is there?

45:26.283 --> 45:28.081
All of it, um...

45:28.535 --> 45:32.203
Beuker. W-w...

45:32.205 --> 45:33.955
What was it, a test?

45:33.957 --> 45:36.157
Where is Mr. Fisher, Frank?

45:36.159 --> 45:38.410
He brought you here from the Hill.

45:38.744 --> 45:41.746
What, are you... are you from Los Alamos?

45:41.748 --> 45:43.381
We don't use that name.

45:46.969 --> 45:48.586
What?

45:52.675 --> 45:54.381
(Exhales)

45:55.846 --> 45:59.431
Well, I don't know what kind
of sick sons of bitches you are,

45:59.433 --> 46:02.734
but you need to talk to Oppenheimer now.

46:02.736 --> 46:04.235
You need to tell him

46:04.237 --> 46:06.154
to... to look at Magpie again.

46:06.156 --> 46:08.606
- Magpie is dead, as you know.
- Oh, God damn it.

46:08.608 --> 46:10.608
It's not Heisenberg's math.

46:10.610 --> 46:13.244
It's ours. It's... it's mine.

46:14.780 --> 46:17.248
If you get me out of here,
I can prove that to you.

46:18.334 --> 46:19.484
How?

46:20.087 --> 46:22.120
You see, my daughter's name...

46:22.585 --> 46:24.372
it's written in the equations

46:24.374 --> 46:26.624
the Nazis are using to build their bomb.

46:30.262 --> 46:32.547
You put your daughter's name...

46:32.549 --> 46:34.171
- in the math?
- Yes.

46:34.801 --> 46:36.044
Yes.

46:36.470 --> 46:38.883
Yes, I did. That's what I'm saying.

46:39.523 --> 46:43.641
They got... they got a man on the
inside and he's stealing our work.

46:45.194 --> 46:48.563
Mr. Fisher thought you were a Nazi spy.

46:49.949 --> 46:52.033
Is that what all of this was for?

46:52.035 --> 46:53.559
But you're not.

46:54.287 --> 46:56.154
You're simply...

46:56.156 --> 46:59.791
ashamed of who you are.

46:59.793 --> 47:01.626
What you came from.

47:02.067 --> 47:03.629
That's good.

47:04.247 --> 47:05.997
We all come from sin.

47:07.333 --> 47:09.084
It's up to us to rise.

47:12.388 --> 47:13.722
(Clears throat)

47:13.724 --> 47:15.223
So...

47:15.225 --> 47:17.058
what, is that it?

47:17.390 --> 47:19.811
I'm just free to go home?

47:19.813 --> 47:21.429
(Chuckles) No.

47:21.431 --> 47:22.847
No.

47:25.684 --> 47:28.103
You recognized your own math.

47:31.607 --> 47:33.108
It's all...

47:35.578 --> 47:37.077
It's all a game.

47:37.748 --> 47:39.914
I tell you that I can prove

47:39.916 --> 47:42.500
the Nazis are using our science,

47:42.502 --> 47:44.035
you... you don't even blink.

47:45.538 --> 47:47.005
Either one of you.

47:51.210 --> 47:53.711
The Germans... Germans didn't
write any of this, did they?

47:53.713 --> 47:55.871
You did. It's propaganda.

47:56.633 --> 47:58.433
You're using our math,

47:58.435 --> 48:01.386
my math, to convince us
the Nazis are winning.

48:03.522 --> 48:07.275
Was... was there even a
Magpie in the first place?

48:07.277 --> 48:09.778
We had a man in Heisenberg's lab.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.613
The Nazis sent us his head.

48:11.615 --> 48:13.945
Yeah, but he... he
didn't give you that file.

48:14.757 --> 48:16.651
You got a lab full of longhairs,

48:16.653 --> 48:18.319
half-Reds, lefty Jews...

48:18.321 --> 48:20.655
how do you get them to
build a wonder weapon?

48:23.292 --> 48:26.661
You just tell them Germany's
gonna end the world tomorrow.

48:29.498 --> 48:31.416
Dogs won't fight.

48:35.304 --> 48:37.422
Heat up the cage.

48:41.427 --> 48:43.928
Adolf Hitler is after a bomb, Frank.

48:43.930 --> 48:46.147
Yeah, but how far along is he?

48:46.149 --> 48:48.349
You don't even know, do you?!

48:48.351 --> 48:51.436
How many other people are you
selling fake intelligence to?

48:51.438 --> 48:54.189
The Secretary of War? The President?
