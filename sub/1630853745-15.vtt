WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.214
Why did you buy me a present?

00:09.718 --> 00:10.802
What?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.095
That’s too much.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.847
I see Storm as a friend
that I would love.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.016
Maybe not a boyfriend.

00:16.057 --> 00:17.600
That’s just not the kind of vibe

00:17.642 --> 00:19.978
that I kind of wanna
be around at the time.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.147
If I don’t see them being, like,
the father of my children,

00:22.188 --> 00:24.649
then, like, I just don’t see
the point in dating them.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.734
Have a good day.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.902
I think
the new deckie’s arriving.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.780
I graduated from the
University of Alabama in 2019...

00:30.822 --> 00:32.699
roll tide.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.410
You know how important
it is to pull fast?

00:35.452 --> 00:38.705
-Yes, sir... ma’am.
-That’s fine.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.373
I’m just really good at
shoving my foot in my mouth.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.292
Co-primary, Eric and Jonathan,
will be accompanied

00:42.334 --> 00:44.419
by Jonathan’s fitness
clients, also models.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.129
Charter guests are
looking forward

00:46.171 --> 00:48.715
to having a BDSM-themed evening.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.884
-Are they uncomfortable?
-Not at all.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.219
Okay, you ready?

00:53.261 --> 00:55.305
Like, wow, what
the [bleep] going on?

00:55.347 --> 00:57.223
Can you guys do, like,
a sea bass baked in salt?

01:04.105 --> 01:05.899
One of us needs to go
to the beach.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.734
I’ll go to the beach.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.320
Gotcha.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.447
Natalya, take everyone to
the beach while we relax

01:12.489 --> 01:16.242
on the yacht with
no guests and no duties.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.498
Cool pics.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.708
I wanna go on a yacht
and drink.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.001
I’ll pose in the nude
for someone,

01:25.043 --> 01:26.586
if that’s what it takes.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.595
Time limitations.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.514
I know you always want
your cabin cleaned.

01:40.725 --> 01:42.560
Do not say, "Sorry the head
of housekeeping

01:42.602 --> 01:43.853
wasn’t here to do your cabin."

01:43.895 --> 01:45.355
No one blamed you.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.773
No, because you just
said the head of housekeeping

01:46.815 --> 01:48.233
was not here, Kyle.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.859
If you think you’re gonna
come for me like you come

01:49.901 --> 01:51.528
for everyone else, you’re
highly ----ing mistaken.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.279
I’ll put you right
in your place.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.408
You’re 24 ----ing years old...
act mature.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.410
I’ll switch that bitch off
in two ----ing seconds.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.712
She’s having another scene again
where she’s trying to attack me,

02:08.753 --> 02:10.380
but trust me,
that’s not gonna happen.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.219
She’s saying you and I need
to manage our time properly,

02:16.261 --> 02:18.346
we’re the most ridiculous
chief stews.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.848
So I said, you know what--

02:19.889 --> 02:21.349
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

02:21.391 --> 02:22.976
don’t talk about a
crewmember in front of me...

02:23.018 --> 02:25.020
-No.
-Behind their back.

02:25.061 --> 02:29.190
So not okay.
You’re a team.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.984
Where’d the love go?

02:31.026 --> 02:34.279
It’s just a brother and sister’s
tiff, they’ll be fine.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.241
What are you doing right now?

02:40.118 --> 02:41.619
Yeah, that’s it.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.585
I did.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.503
Okay.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.884
Yeah. Yeah.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.556
Tomorrow morning
when we wake up...

03:06.978 --> 03:08.438
Mm-hmm.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.901
Wow, look at you!

03:12.942 --> 03:14.194
Thank you, thank you.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.279
Oh, my God!

03:16.321 --> 03:17.489
-Yes!
-I love these clothes.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.742
All right, now,
gimp, get in there.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.369
-Nice.
-Where is everyone?

03:22.410 --> 03:23.745
Where’s Brett?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.580
I don’t know, we have a
bunch of casualties.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.873
-Amanda’s not feeling well.
-But is Brett not coming?

03:26.915 --> 03:27.874
John’s not feeling well.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.959
[snoring]

03:31.294 --> 03:32.629
Oh, no.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.131
[bleep]

03:35.173 --> 03:36.758
Oh ----ing hell, mate,

03:36.800 --> 03:38.927
looks like there’s a ----ing
creature in there.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.470
Want a hand?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.226
Whenever I’m cooking,
I’m always learning,

03:46.267 --> 03:47.727
so I make mistakes too.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.146
I’ve got this massive,
like, salt-baked fish

03:50.188 --> 03:52.357
that was too big to
get it in there,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.067
and it’s gonna be
a nightmare for me

03:54.109 --> 03:56.403
to hacksaw it out of the oven.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.905
You have a little look
at the wine list.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.990
So, let’s do the
Louis Jadot Montrachet.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.200
You definitely need
to decant that one.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.284
Yeah.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.245
Then we’ll also have a tinto.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.871
Oh, you got it, mate.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.876
Sick!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.128
Good job.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.380
We only have four guests,
just so you know.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.798
-Four for dinner?
-Yeah.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.842
That’s a big fish
for four people.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.220
[imitates Batman]
Kyle.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.388
How are you tonight?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.723
I’m fantastic.
How are you?

04:24.764 --> 04:25.890
[imitates Batman]
This is my voice.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.018
Thanks for
the sparkling water.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.603
You get dressed up like this
to perhaps go to a club,

04:30.645 --> 04:32.897
a private event, perhaps.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.108
But I have no idea why
you’re willing

04:35.150 --> 04:37.277
to put yourself through
the full-course meal.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.820
You got in that suit
with no food.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.780
I have no idea how
you’re getting out of it

04:40.822 --> 04:42.490
with a stomach full,
you know what I’m saying?

04:42.532 --> 04:43.658
Kyle, do you wanna grab bread?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.411
-Sure, hon.
-Thanks, hon.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.081
Why?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.082
Did you not see it?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.042
No.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.961
I’ll tell you about it after.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.421
Pretty cold.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.552
I wanna see this.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.554
Yeah, me too, we’re all excited.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.847
It’s a rock.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.599
So, do you light it
and then smash it?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.852
Light it, carry it over,
wait for it to go out,

05:10.894 --> 05:12.228
and then smash it.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.898
-And then pray that it’s cooked.
-It’s cooked.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.524
[laughing]

05:16.566 --> 05:18.985
Ah, Namaste, Namaste.

05:19.027 --> 05:25.408
Hey, so we have the parmesan
with the pine nut salad.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.077
Healthy and tasty and light.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.579
Look at this party, I love it.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.915
It’s not gimmicky,
it’s very classy.

05:31.956 --> 05:32.999
Mm-hmm.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.168
Ooh, is that burrata?

05:35.210 --> 05:36.544
Here he comes.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.588
Oh, that looks so cool!

05:38.630 --> 05:40.507
-Look at that!
-Oh, wow.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.175
What’s on fire, did you
put liquor on that?

05:42.217 --> 05:43.510
We put some vodka on there.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.346
And what does the salt
do for the process?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.264
So, basically,
it creates an oven.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.016
Oh...
wow, very cool.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.894
I’m so glad I’m wearing
a tight, black outfit.

05:56.439 --> 06:00.068
So, we can literally
just pull it away.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.569
Oh.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.363
That looks amazing.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.739
That’s impressive, David.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.408
It’s gotta be so good.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.410
Thank you.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.869
Thanks, Dave,
this looks fantastic.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.204
-Wow.
-It’s really good.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.330
Mm-hmm.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.748
So cool.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.000
I mean, all I need’s vodka
and the torch?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.126
Yeah.

06:16.167 --> 06:17.544
I don’t know, everything’s
so good,

06:17.585 --> 06:18.837
it’s, like, perfectly seasoned.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.380
The spiky choke collar
is making it

06:20.422 --> 06:21.756
a little more difficult to eat.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.679
You girls look lovely, yum.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.561
Are you coming back?

06:34.602 --> 06:36.354
Uh, maybe.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.605
Okay.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.946
[door locks]

06:52.537 --> 06:53.872
Well, I’ve gotta run up,

06:53.913 --> 06:56.458
so you can tell me about
it later, if you will.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.631
All right.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.467
So many bowls.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.177
Mm, it’s a major meal.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.845
All right,
I’ll have a little more pesto.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.513
I think actually
that was my favorite.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.141
I liked the milky...
what’s it-ciana.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.060
[speaks foreign language]

07:15.101 --> 07:17.562
Yeah, that was pretty
impressive, actually.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.818
I am full, I think.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.779
You’re throwing in the towel?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.710
What’s up?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.423
I’d hug you, but you’re
covered in oil.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.841
No, I’m fine now.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.972
Thank you.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.977
It’s just murdering you?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.604
I called you a bitch behind
your back, number two.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.690
-Who’d you to, Tash?
-To David.

08:09.364 --> 08:13.076
I knew Nat and I were gonna get
into a situation eventually.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.496
I just vomit everything out;
she does, too.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.082
But even with that said,
I screwed up.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.002
That’s not the person
I need to be.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.796
Thank you for coming down.

08:26.715 --> 08:30.385
I look like fat Batman...
Fatman!

08:30.427 --> 08:32.929
-Fatman and Robin.
-Fatman.

08:32.971 --> 08:33.972
Good night.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.018
I’m going to get out
of my outfit.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.936
I wanna tell you something
real quick.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.689
I went down to Nat now,
just to inform you.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.233
I apologized for
the miscommunication

08:45.275 --> 08:48.570
that we had here,
and I wasn’t even thinking.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.238
I can’t ----ing think
with this.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.990
No, but the thing is, like,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.616
if you’re in housekeeping
on a trip,

08:53.658 --> 08:57.454
I’d be like, oh, Kyle,
who’s housekeeping, la, la, la.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.873
That’s what it tried to say,
and it went downhill.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.458
Yeah, I won’t worry
about that, really.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.792
No, but everything’s
been sorted and hugged it out

09:02.834 --> 09:04.127
-and everything.
-Okay, good.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.963
I’m like, Kyle, what
are you apologizing for?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.798
Natalya’s getting more
and more difficult.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.216
She doesn’t respect us.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.718
The boat’s gotta be clean
in the morning

09:11.760 --> 09:13.053
or breakfast has got to
be fully pulled...

09:13.094 --> 09:14.763
it’s gotta be one or the other.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.514
They really needed help
with lifting that stuff down.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.932
I’m making the drinks
for the guests.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.059
Bullsh--. Kyle’s setting
the table right now.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.310
That doesn’t need to be done.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.686
Don’t speak to me like that.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.687
I haven’t spoken to you
in any way, Tash.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.855
No, don’t disrespect me.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.231
I don’t stand for that.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.109
The apology should not be
coming from Kyle.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.070
Kyle, you’re very sweet,
but there’s certain things

09:30.111 --> 09:31.863
you do not need
to apologize for.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.074
I just don’t want you
to get walked all over,

09:34.115 --> 09:36.701
and I won’t stand for getting
walked all over, either.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.872
Oops...

09:40.914 --> 09:43.041
baby steps, baby steps.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.460
[belches]

09:45.502 --> 09:46.670
Sweetest dreams.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.671
Good night.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.255
All guests down.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.270
Interesting tactic
for a break-up...

10:04.312 --> 10:06.356
jump into bed again, so...

10:13.196 --> 10:15.031
Yeah.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.981
I was really annoyed,
but obviously, I just smiled

10:48.023 --> 10:49.649
and waved and act
like everything

10:49.691 --> 10:50.734
was rosy on the service.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.152
But really, I’m [bleep] off.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.363
We all know Natasha
hates confrontation.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.698
When we had trouble between us,

10:56.740 --> 10:59.117
she would never
approach me about anything.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.844
Coming up...

11:17.886 --> 11:19.304
Come in just straight to me.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.973
[bleep] kill it, kill it...
reverse, reverse...

11:22.015 --> 11:24.351
-[bleep].
-Whoa.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.353
I’ve got nothing else more to
explain to you than what I did.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.563
If you’re looking for attention,
you’re not gonna get it from me.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.939
-Kyle pipe down.
-Bullsh--.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.415
[bleep]

11:49.668 --> 11:51.419
It’s rosemary.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.921
-Morning.
-Yeah.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.301
Yeah.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.431
[laughing]

12:05.141 --> 12:06.601
Something that I thought of.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.645
-What?
-You distracted me.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.897
-I attracted you?
-Distracted.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.400
Mm... whatever you
wanna call it.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.026
Same thing?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.277
I think Courts
is finding her feet

12:16.319 --> 12:17.737
really well as lead deckhand.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.281
I think Courtney deserves it.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.951
All of the disappointment,
I think, is going away from me.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.244
It’s very early.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.162
I’ve grown up
with four siblings.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.249
I’m used to not always
getting what you want.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.917
-Did you do ballet?
-Yeah.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.254
<i>Storm, what’s your location?</i>

12:34.295 --> 12:35.714
<i>I’m in the pantry, Cap,</i>

12:35.755 --> 12:37.257
I can meet you in the bridge
if you’d like.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.263
Good morning.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.556
I’m gonna need to work out
later, can we do that?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.807
Let’s do it.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.017
We can do something
just, like...

12:47.058 --> 12:48.018
We can go to the sundeck or
the...

12:48.059 --> 12:49.310
or underneath, right?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.562
The sundeck, the very top one,
yeah.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.022
Okay.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.106
We can start to put
breakfast on the table now.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.315
That’d be great.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.859
You can put
the paddleboards out

12:55.900 --> 12:57.610
and then set up
the swim platform.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.778
Yes, ma’am.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.822
Wack on, Johnny, wack on.

13:00.864 --> 13:01.906
[laughing]

13:01.948 --> 13:03.616
So heavy.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.456
Oh! Oops.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.500
-942.
-Mm.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.337
The guests are gonna
sit down now for breakfast.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.172
-Sorry about that.
-No, don’t be.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.923
They’re gonna work out,

13:18.965 --> 13:20.175
which will give us time
to put all the toys in.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.552
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Cap.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.762
Can you stand up?
I wanna appreciate this outfit.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.388
Sure.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.515
You always dress so nice, I
always love the way you dress.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.683
She is hot.

13:28.725 --> 13:32.395
Okay, turn the other way,
I think... yeah.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.899
These women are supposed to
be the primary’s clients,

13:35.940 --> 13:38.234
but in actual fact,
the client

13:38.276 --> 13:40.195
might be the primary
charter guest.

13:40.236 --> 13:44.199
So, you need to learn to make
googly eyes at the camera.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.867
Something is fishy.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.869
It’s not the ocean that I’m on.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.246
Oh, my God, your hair
looks so luscious.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.416
What’d you do to it?

13:53.458 --> 13:56.878
You should try that again.
I think that would help.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.338
Gross.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.968
Natalya, Natalya, all cabins
are available for your services.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.056
-How are you?
-Well.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.475
-I’m nearly ready to serve.
-Okay.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.851
Bacon on them two.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.061
I’ve got John and Brett.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.312
I’ll take Eric.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.439
I should actually
capture your hair,

14:16.481 --> 14:18.233
because it does
look really cool.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.987
Kinda weird that it
looks so cool.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.322
Okay, this is cool.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
We need to get the skis out.

14:25.740 --> 14:29.035
Thank you so much.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.745
You got more hollandaise
sauce than me.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.123
This is what happens when
you pay for the trip.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.086
So, what’s the plan?

14:38.128 --> 14:39.963
So, aerobics class.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.423
I think we’ll finish
with water sports.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.508
And then I’ll take some
pictures up there.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.509
Yeah.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.053
I wanna go sit up
on the sundeck.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.638
You can’t just jump in,
you gotta do something.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.390
Dive in.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.641
Bomb-drop in.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.645
That was sh--!

14:55.687 --> 14:58.857
<i>Can Kyle help me just for</i>
<i>two minutes in the double?</i>

14:58.898 --> 15:00.442
Copy, babe, I’m on my way.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.611
How long you guys gonna
work out?

15:03.653 --> 15:05.113
Probably 45 minutes.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.949
Perfect, perfect, man,
thank you so much, enjoy.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.243
-Okay, thanks, buddy.
-Is it bad?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.203
Let me just remove my shoes.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.831
Oh, yes... okay, stay lying
down, stay lying down.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.958
We’re gonna start out
with some lying down.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.710
Can you do some glutes?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.213
Why is it so hot?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.298
Because I’m, like,
boiling in here.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.632
And it smells like noodles.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.178
Squeeze your glutes,
tighten those abs, good.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.138
So, all the cabins are
done now, after this one.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.140
Okay, now, let’s just
go to your hip thrusts,

15:32.182 --> 15:33.433
and just relax your head.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.435
Look like you’re
enjoying life.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.813
High-camera quality photos.

15:38.855 --> 15:43.234
Three, excellent, you guys.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.237
Finish strong.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.991
Is tonight the African theme?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.701
It is, yeah.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.495
Day two.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.788
Safari-themed dinner,
where they can

15:54.829 --> 15:56.039
bring out their inner animal.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.332
-I got some cod.
-Yeah.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.834
I’m gonna do that
milk tart.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.169
Oh, for dessert?

16:01.211 --> 16:03.171
Last dinner I tried
to blow them away.

16:03.213 --> 16:05.382
Half of them ----ing missed it.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.259
I just have to be ----ing
amazing again.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.929
Courtney, where does this go?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.139
Just down there.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.349
You’ll notice most
things on this boat

16:14.391 --> 16:16.893
don’t really have a home.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.646
Kinda ironic, given the name.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.523
It’s a funny joke!

16:23.233 --> 16:24.776
I don’t know.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.614
-Sure.
-Peckers.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.366
When I join a new boat,

16:31.408 --> 16:34.119
I’ve always struggled
with banter, quick wit.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.412
How do you twerk, Mzi?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.580
Let’s see...
oh, my God.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.581
I’m out.

16:38.623 --> 16:39.916
Guys!

16:39.958 --> 16:42.419
I think this crew got
really close before I got

16:42.460 --> 16:44.504
Look, she can do it
like a mother----er.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.215
It’s intimidating,

16:47.257 --> 16:50.468
but I definitely appreciate
and love

16:50.510 --> 16:52.679
the kind of personality
that they have.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.264
-Can you see a storm coming?
-It’s a bit windy.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.767
Fill out, you guys are awesome.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.893
Woo!

16:58.935 --> 17:00.353
-Oh, wow.
-Go, team!

17:00.395 --> 17:02.564
-That was awesome, yay!
-Nicely done.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.898
Ooh, these are really nice.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.608
-Aren’t they?
-I like a big bottom.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.278
No!

17:10.739 --> 17:13.241
-Hey.
-Hi, what do we have here?

17:13.283 --> 17:15.493
-What are these little minis?
-Seabobs.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.703
Shush!

17:16.745 --> 17:18.538
And obviously the jet-skis,
paddleboards.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.083
The idea is to turn them over
and get their swimsuits off.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.586
That’s the whole point.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.046
Okay.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.172
For the jet-ski, I will need
you to wear a life jacket.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.423
Okay.

17:28.465 --> 17:29.632
But you’re pretty
good at this?

17:29.674 --> 17:30.800
-Yeah.
-Whoa.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.052
Go, Hannah!

17:32.093 --> 17:33.595
Ah!

17:33.636 --> 17:36.514
Hannah, look over
here, woo-hoo!

17:38.099 --> 17:40.685
-Ah!
-Don’t kill anybody!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.103
Sh--.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.438
Courts? Yeah?

17:45.315 --> 17:47.525
-Yeah.
-Way to go, Diana!

17:49.611 --> 17:52.405
-Don’t start it until I...
-Okay.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.782
...say, just because
there’s a line behind you.

17:53.823 --> 17:54.866
Yeah.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.207
-Anybody else want the jet-ski?
-I do.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.541
Yeah?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.836
Okay, wait, yeah.
Just come in, so yeah.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.463
And then just kill it,
kill it, kill it.

18:08.505 --> 18:13.134
-[bleep].
-You all right?

18:13.176 --> 18:15.220
Okay, are you coming on?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.389
Come in just straight to me.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.308
Wait a second...

18:20.350 --> 18:22.811
Stop, stop, stop,
reverse, reverse...

18:22.852 --> 18:23.978
oh [bleep].

18:24.020 --> 18:25.605
Whoa.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.066
[bleep] me, like, this is my
first time as lead deckhand.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.901
Storm feels like he can
trust me enough

18:29.943 --> 18:31.152
to leave me kind of in charge,

18:31.194 --> 18:32.612
and I have ----ing
guests smacking

18:32.654 --> 18:33.947
against the side of the boat.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.246
-Oh [bleep] me.
-Oh, no.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.791
Just wait there two seconds.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.464
Just be careful.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.258
How’s the side of the boat?

19:01.266 --> 19:02.767
Thank [bleep].

19:02.809 --> 19:04.519
I’m off, so just keep
eyes on them.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.562
I’m just gonna go
and swap my radio,

19:05.603 --> 19:07.063
just because it’s died.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.690
-You got it, you got it.
-I’ll be back in two secs.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.612
[bleep] man.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.534
They just ----ing drove into the
side of the boat on a jet-ski.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.910
-What?
-Are you serious?

19:20.952 --> 19:23.246
Yeah...
it’s okay, the jet-ski’s fine.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.415
They’re back out on it now,
so you can’t see.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.791
-Everyone’s okay?
-Yeah.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.085
There wasn’t actual damage.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.420
-Wow.
-I know.

19:30.462 --> 19:32.547
All right, that’s okay,
it was a mistake.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.799
-Go down for an hour.
-Yeah.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.929
-Way to go, girls.
-Nice job.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.681
-How you guys going?
-What time is it?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.433
Nap time.
Could be nap time.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.060
It’s nap time.

19:55.445 --> 19:56.613
It is, eh?

19:57.989 --> 20:00.992
Cap, I wanted to ask you how
to do an incident report

20:01.034 --> 20:03.161
with one of the guests
on the WaveRunner.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.454
What happened?

20:04.496 --> 20:07.457
One of the guests
pushed on the stern,

20:07.499 --> 20:09.042
but she just came around.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.585
Like, you know, when she was
trying to come to the NautiBuoy,

20:10.627 --> 20:11.628
she just missed it.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.088
-They were all fine.
-Oh.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.798
There’s no damage to
the boat that I can...

20:14.839 --> 20:16.966
I know that...
oh, you don’t... no, it’s not?

20:17.008 --> 20:17.842
Okay.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.302
That’s called "chartering."

20:19.344 --> 20:20.845
All right, I just wanted
to make sure.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.305
-It’s called normal.
-Copy that.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.932
We’re gonna make mistakes.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.476
In this case, no one’s hurt,
nothing’s damaged,

20:26.518 --> 20:28.144
it’s not a big deal.

20:28.186 --> 20:32.565
But at the same time, that’s how
communication should happen.

20:32.607 --> 20:33.983
That’s how you gain trust.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.403
I’m just happy
that nothing happened.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.697
Yeah.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.950
Yeah I thought tonight, like
green and the color green...

20:41.991 --> 20:43.451
Is tonight the jungle?

20:43.493 --> 20:45.453
Yeah, but we’re just gonna
do the table jungle theme,

20:45.495 --> 20:47.497
so we don’t need to
do two decks.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.003
Tash and I still haven’t
resolved, like, our conflict

20:53.044 --> 20:54.713
with everything going
on with work.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.172
I just don’t agree
with her management style.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.882
But you know, I’m here
to get my job done,

20:57.924 --> 20:59.718
she’s here to get her job done,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.761
so we can put that aside and
deal with it at a later stage.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.763
It’s just about work
communication at this point.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.021
No décor has arrived besides
this, besides costumes.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.564
-It’s like, that’s...
-That’s not at all...

21:12.605 --> 21:16.067
This is the safari hat.
This is the safari hat.

21:26.411 --> 21:30.373
I still need to do
cabins, laundry.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.209
[insect sounds plays]

21:33.251 --> 21:35.128
Mother[bleep].

21:41.426 --> 21:42.802
Meow.

21:42.844 --> 21:45.513
Hello!

21:45.555 --> 21:47.640
I like the ears.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.517
I don’t know, which ears
do you think?

21:49.559 --> 21:51.770
Honestly, if you have
a big trunk,

21:51.811 --> 21:53.063
then I would suggest
the elephant one.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.189
Call me Dumbo.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.482
[laughing]

21:58.276 --> 21:59.235
Pretty nice.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.236
This is great.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.739
This is so great, oh, my gosh.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.741
Would you like to start with
a white wine this evening?

22:04.783 --> 22:05.784
Yeah?

22:08.119 --> 22:09.537
-Still.
-Still?

22:09.579 --> 22:11.998
So, what do you think
the nickname’s gonna be,

22:12.040 --> 22:13.166
Dumbo or Floppy?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.668
Dumbo.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.087
Better than Floppy, I guess.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.296
Natalya, Tash.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.924
The cabins are free,
if you need to get in.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.468
Copy.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.597
-Hi.
-What’s happening?

22:27.639 --> 22:30.266
-Not much.
-How are you?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.394
Mm, I feel bad.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.979
Try and pick you up... dance?

22:38.066 --> 22:39.984
Hello?

22:40.026 --> 22:41.152
I love this one.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.240
Wait, leave it on...
put it on again.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.283
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>can you please get someone</i>

22:47.325 --> 22:49.619
<i>to clear the upstairs bin bag</i>

22:49.661 --> 22:51.705
<i>and the lower stairs</i>
<i>bin bag, please?</i>

22:53.623 --> 22:55.500
Deck crew, can you
please get someone

22:55.542 --> 22:57.919
to clean upstairs pantry?

22:59.671 --> 23:00.964
It makes me really happy

23:01.006 --> 23:02.632
that we’ve got such
a good friendship.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.592
Obviously, we both kind of
wanted to be lead deck,

23:04.634 --> 23:06.469
but even if he didn’t get it,

23:06.511 --> 23:08.054
he never, like,
takes it out on me.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.273
Oh, God.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.109
Oh, my God, what did I miss?

23:21.151 --> 23:22.527
Can I take this for you?

23:22.569 --> 23:26.197
Do you have to go,
can you support me?

23:26.239 --> 23:27.407
All right, what do you need?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.159
It’s a secret.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.119
No ways.

23:31.161 --> 23:34.330
I have moments sometimes, like,
stuff just triggers me.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.540
Yeah.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.876
Whoa, what has been
used in here?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.252
It’s, like, oily.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.257
All right, I’m gonna
throw this up there.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.051
What time are you finishing,
same same?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.344
Same, yeah.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.970
Yeah, well, after I finish,

23:49.012 --> 23:50.472
I’ve got two more cabins
and then I’ve gotta go to...

23:50.513 --> 23:53.099
I’ll try and wrap up when
you do, so we can hang.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.810
We can bang, more like.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.563
Nat is so confusing, man.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.732
Like, she needs to decide,
you know, does she wanna be,

24:00.774 --> 24:02.192
like, a really good friend,

24:02.233 --> 24:03.902
or does she wanna lie in bed
and kiss all night?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.445
I mean, I can have
a conversation with her,

24:05.487 --> 24:07.572
but I know that she’s not
gonna respond to that.

24:07.614 --> 24:08.865
I’m kind of stuck.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.952
Coming up...

24:12.994 --> 24:15.038
Do you fancy anybody on
board, other than me?

24:15.080 --> 24:16.247
No, I’m joking.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.958
You have an undiagnosed
case of narcissism.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.044
Wow.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.504
Be careful what you
say to people.

24:29.678 --> 24:30.387
That actually works for you.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.264
Yeah, do it... be really
still, oh, that’s great.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.308
It’s the little bangs
and the hat, yeah.

24:35.350 --> 24:37.977
-That’s so cute!
-Yeah, it’s the little bangs.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.355
Can I do anything to help?

24:40.397 --> 24:41.773
You can.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.233
I just need to get the fish,

24:43.274 --> 24:44.984
and then I need the
asparagus to go...

24:45.026 --> 24:46.444
So, you want me to do
the asparagus?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.488
-Kind of like that.
-Yeah?

24:48.530 --> 24:51.741
I feel like Dave is in a good
space on the boat right now.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.119
It feels like he’s back
to his old self.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.204
It’s, like, a nice energy,

24:56.246 --> 24:58.498
and we have each other’s
backs, which is great.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.749
I’m gonna blowtorch.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.376
Are you not blowtorching
at the table?

25:01.418 --> 25:02.961
No, it’s taking too long,
it’s gonna be cold.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.295
Okay.
We’re ready.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.465
Dude, that looks ----ing
ridiculous, dude.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.676
I mean, that’s average,
I’ve seen good things before.

25:09.718 --> 25:13.471
Ready to rock?
Yeah?

25:13.513 --> 25:14.556
Oh, look at that!

25:14.597 --> 25:15.890
That’s what you ----ing want.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.809
It’s gonna be a winner.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.436
-Whoa.
-Oh, wow.

25:19.477 --> 25:20.854
That is a big plate.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.064
Okay, guys, got butternut squash
puree in the base,

25:23.106 --> 25:25.275
we got some spinach,
some grilled asparagus,

25:25.316 --> 25:27.318
and then we’ve got
grilled black cod

25:27.360 --> 25:28.695
with a citrus hollandaise.

25:28.737 --> 25:30.822
-Love it.
-Mm, it’s good.

25:30.864 --> 25:33.992
Oh, my God,
it’s Saturday.

25:34.034 --> 25:37.245
I’m missing the ’Bama
game right now.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.621
No!

25:38.663 --> 25:39.706
We’re playing Ole Miss.

25:39.748 --> 25:40.707
-What is that?
-American.

25:40.749 --> 25:42.375
Oh, American football...

25:42.417 --> 25:44.461
-I don’t understand it.
-I don’t understand it either.

25:44.502 --> 25:47.505
I just know that they
wear big shoulder pads.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.882
Does that turn you on?

25:48.923 --> 25:51.176
No, it really doesn’t,
actually.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.552
Okay, I’m done.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.220
[laughing]

25:56.806 --> 25:58.475
Oh, my God.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.226
-Almost.
-Chaos.

26:02.729 --> 26:03.813
That was really good.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.023
I’m glad.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.358
Because it’s so
tender and tasty.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.359
Yeah.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.485
Clear, Dave.

26:08.526 --> 26:09.903
Clear?

26:11.738 --> 26:13.031
Are you gonna come and announce?

26:13.073 --> 26:16.201
Yep.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.499
[chattering]

26:22.540 --> 26:24.000
This is a South African classic.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.627
It’s called a milk tart.

26:25.669 --> 26:26.878
Thank you, Dave.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.421
You’ll definitely enjoy it.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.634
-I’m in my happy place.
-I’m exhausted.

26:32.676 --> 26:34.219
Tash, can I do a beer again?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.303
Yeah, sure.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.846
Did everyone eat it?

26:36.888 --> 26:41.184
Completely finished, the master
devoured it like an animal.

26:41.226 --> 26:42.143
[phone rings]

26:43.353 --> 26:44.938
Hey.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.273
-Hey!
-Hey, sis.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.403
I woke up around 1:00.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.532
No, I tried to,
but I haven’t adjusted.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.702
My home town, Decatur,
Alabama, it’s a small town.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.078
Everyone knows each other,

27:00.120 --> 27:01.663
everyone knows each
other’s business.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.081
It’s just not for me.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.000
I do wanna travel,
I do wanna see the world,

27:05.041 --> 27:06.501
and I can’t really do that from
Decatur.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.378
It’ll always have
a special place in my heart,

27:08.420 --> 27:12.424
but I need to be somewhere
where I can one, be someone,

27:12.465 --> 27:17.637
and do something big, but
also...

27:17.679 --> 27:19.305
be able to have fun.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.767
Yeah, I would
like to think so.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.102
I just wanna touch base.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.770
I know I hadn’t talked
to you all day.

27:25.812 --> 27:26.980
I love y’all.

27:27.022 --> 27:29.607
Ah, I’m cramping... ow!

27:29.649 --> 27:31.443
I need potassium.

27:34.362 --> 27:35.739
You’re welcome.

27:35.780 --> 27:36.781
Another hefeweizen?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.241
It’s a lot of head, though.

27:38.283 --> 27:40.243
Any time I get all head,
that’s always great.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.420
Thanks so much for dinner.

27:50.462 --> 27:51.421
Oh, you’re welcome.

27:51.463 --> 27:52.714
Thank you.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.758
Retreat to the lair.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.009
I’m so tired.

27:56.051 --> 27:58.136
All right, I’ll see
you mañana, JT.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.346
See you in the morning.

28:02.349 --> 28:05.185
It’s 11:20 now.
Shall I leave 11:40?

28:06.478 --> 28:09.647
Yeah, just the moment
that you’re done.

28:09.689 --> 28:12.525
I could fold those napkins
and get that sorted.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.987
It takes forever.

28:21.284 --> 28:23.203
Anyway, we’ll just do it
as we normally do.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.206
Yeah.

28:27.290 --> 28:28.792
All right.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.543
Natalya’s frustrating at times,

28:30.585 --> 28:32.962
because I don’t wanna feel
like I’m on eggshells

28:33.004 --> 28:35.298
with someone I’m working
so closely with.

28:35.340 --> 28:40.053
It’s like she wants to be
the boss, but she’s not.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.016
I’m gonna wipe and vacuum,

28:45.058 --> 28:46.768
so hopefully you at least
clear the--

28:46.810 --> 28:48.645
-I’ll clear the pantry.
-And I’ll just vacuum here.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.653
Babe, I’m going to bed.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.113
[yawns]

29:11.584 --> 29:13.169
[snoring]

29:21.553 --> 29:23.138
-Reid.
-What’s up, my friend.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.764
So, you’re on the bow.

29:24.806 --> 29:28.059
Your yellow line’s gonna go
first to the tender buoys,

29:28.101 --> 29:29.602
and then make sure
that you lock it,

29:29.644 --> 29:31.146
because as soon as
you lock this one...

29:31.187 --> 29:32.355
You’ve gotta drop
your other lines.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.065
Okay.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.316
And by that time, hopefully
I can send someone out

29:35.358 --> 29:36.526
to come get you,
or we’ll come help you.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.736
Is she gonna tell me...

29:37.777 --> 29:38.903
who’s gonna tell me which one to
go first?

29:38.945 --> 29:39.904
Either one of us will tell you.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.281
Yellow lines first, not black.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.490
-Yellow.
-Yellow lines.

29:42.532 --> 29:44.159
Yes.

29:44.200 --> 29:47.495
Deck crew, deck crew, anchor up,
we’re headed back to the dock.

29:47.537 --> 29:48.580
Copy, cap.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.998
Good morning, Eric, how are you?

29:50.040 --> 29:50.999
All right, how you doing?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.625
Yeah, very well, thanks.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.464
Anchor at the waterline.

29:59.591 --> 30:00.759
Anchor home.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.761
<i>Nice work, Courtney and Mzi.</i>

30:02.802 --> 30:06.181
ETA to the dock is 37 minutes.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.771
All right, chow down.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.356
Yummy.

30:14.397 --> 30:18.443
Fruits, chocolates, pastries,
it’s really good.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.403
If the wind’s coming from
the starboard side,

30:20.445 --> 30:23.114
whoever’s on the starboard
is gonna lock it off

30:23.156 --> 30:25.158
round the capstan,
around the cleats,

30:25.200 --> 30:26.785
and then you’re gonna help
him on the bow,

30:26.826 --> 30:28.078
because he’s gonna need help.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.662
A new crew is kind of
like a recipe

30:29.704 --> 30:31.164
for something to go wrong.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.874
From what I’ve spoken to
Reid about his experience

30:32.916 --> 30:36.920
on boats before, he seems
to be aware of the procedures

30:36.961 --> 30:38.338
that need to happen,

30:38.380 --> 30:40.757
the speed in which things
need to work on the bow.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.807
I guess the only way that
we can find out is just do it.

30:48.848 --> 30:53.144
Thirty meters, thirty meters
off your port.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.356
Coming up...

30:56.398 --> 30:57.857
Captain Sandy stepped in
and she said

30:57.899 --> 30:59.609
don’t speak like that.

30:59.651 --> 31:01.152
I’ve got nothing else more
to explain to you.

31:01.194 --> 31:02.237
-Own your bullsh--.
-Kyle, pipe down.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.655
You’ve been attacking Tash.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.824
I’m literally the most
calmest person here.

31:12.622 --> 31:13.998
Switching to starboard wing,
switching to starboard wing.

31:16.334 --> 31:17.752
<i>Copy, Captain, copy.</i>

31:17.794 --> 31:20.755
-Fenders ready.
-Just in case, yeah, yeah?

31:20.797 --> 31:21.840
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.176
Your stern is clear to swing.

31:29.097 --> 31:30.265
Your on line, you’re on line,

31:30.306 --> 31:31.850
you can start backing
up, Captain.

31:35.687 --> 31:36.521
Ten meters.

31:36.563 --> 31:39.274
Kick to starboard, Captain.

31:39.315 --> 31:41.151
Light boat, man,
it blows around like crazy.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.194
Captain, if you
can kick to port,

31:43.236 --> 31:45.238
we need to align
ourselves at the dock.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.365
Hey, Reid.

31:47.407 --> 31:51.494
We need to kick to port to
align with the bollards.

31:51.536 --> 31:53.621
Eight meters cable to stern,
you’re straight.

31:53.663 --> 31:58.585
Okay, Courts, you can throw
the first spring line, please.

31:58.626 --> 32:01.212
Mzi, get your line out, please,
get your line out.

32:01.254 --> 32:02.839
We’re secure on the bow, Cap.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.800
Mzi, you can stop locking and
just let it loose a little bit,

32:05.842 --> 32:08.511
and then re-go.

32:08.553 --> 32:11.264
Okay, Captain, you’re good,
engines are down.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.641
<i>Thanks, everyone.</i>
<i>Excellent work.</i>

32:13.683 --> 32:15.101
That was good,
thank you so much.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.936
Just go give Reid
a hand, please?

32:16.978 --> 32:18.313
She’s a ----ing weapon.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.065
-Great job.
-Thanks, buddy.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.775
[screeches]

32:21.816 --> 32:23.651
Okay, Reid, you good?

32:23.693 --> 32:26.071
I gotta drop
them this black one.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.072
Yeah.

32:27.113 --> 32:28.281
So, yeah, put that through.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.949
Yeah, we’re good, homie.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.326
[bleep] oh, these lines.

32:31.368 --> 32:32.911
Some of these lines are
super slippery anyway.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.205
But we have to come up
and get that as well.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.956
Hey, how did you
feel on the bow?

32:36.998 --> 32:38.375
It felt great.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.460
-You did a good job.
-I appreciate that, Cap.

32:40.502 --> 32:42.003
Nice work
back there, Courtney.

32:42.045 --> 32:43.254
Thanks.

32:43.296 --> 32:44.756
There’s luggage
in the crew hall,

32:44.798 --> 32:45.965
be careful while
you’re up there.

32:46.007 --> 32:47.300
[bleep] me.

32:47.342 --> 32:48.968
Sweating my ----ing
tits off, brü.

32:49.010 --> 32:50.637
All crew, all crew, let’s meet
on the dock for guest departure.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.514
Copy.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.020
Oh, no, I don’t wanna leave.

32:59.062 --> 33:00.230
[chuckling]

33:00.271 --> 33:03.108
Lifesaver over here.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.443
Hey, thank you so much,
my packing elf.

33:05.485 --> 33:06.611
My little packing elf.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.321
You were great, oh, my God.

33:08.363 --> 33:09.906
And you didn’t pack yourself in
my suitcase, like I asked.

33:09.948 --> 33:11.449
It’s not too late,
it’s not too late.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.659
You gotta find room.

33:12.701 --> 33:14.494
Yuck.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.162
Thank you so much,
Captain Sandy,

33:16.204 --> 33:18.707
you are the most badass lady
I think I’ve ever met.

33:18.748 --> 33:22.460
Just like to thank all of you,
you guys did a great job.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.295
Everyone was really helpful

33:24.337 --> 33:25.797
and I thought the food
was spectacular.

33:25.839 --> 33:27.048
On the hike, I loved
the location,

33:27.090 --> 33:28.174
the color was beautiful.

33:28.216 --> 33:29.759
I really appreciate it.

33:29.801 --> 33:32.053
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.221
-Thank you, guys.
-Bye!

33:33.263 --> 33:34.681
Bye, guys, thank you.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.558
All right, guys, out of
our whites, into our reds,

33:36.599 --> 33:38.518
and we’re gonna meet in the main
salon for our tip meeting,

33:38.560 --> 33:39.769
and we’re gonna turn
the boat around.

33:39.811 --> 33:40.854
-Woo!
-Yes.

33:40.895 --> 33:41.896
-All right.
-Great.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.690
-Good job, good job.
-Thank you, Cap.

33:43.732 --> 33:47.360
Nothing, honestly for nothing.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.320
Yeah, yeah, take it
to the candy shop,

33:49.362 --> 33:51.406
it’s just a lollypop.

33:57.412 --> 33:58.580
Dude, it was good.

33:59.581 --> 34:01.416
I’m glad it was
only three days.

34:01.458 --> 34:03.585
I know, yeah.

34:10.508 --> 34:11.926
All crew, all crew,
let’s meet in the main salon

34:11.968 --> 34:13.386
for our tip meeting.

34:13.428 --> 34:15.722
All crew to the main salon
for our tip meeting.

34:20.185 --> 34:21.186
Everyone just give me space.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.355
[laughing]

34:23.396 --> 34:27.859
All right, so,
great charter, honestly.

34:27.901 --> 34:30.153
And David, the fish...

34:30.195 --> 34:32.405
the fish was really
freaking cool.

34:32.447 --> 34:34.282
Yeah, that was awesome.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.576
Interior, you guys killed it,
as always.

34:36.618 --> 34:38.703
You had a growth moment,
which I totally love.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.497
Yeah.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.874
Reid, welcome,
you did a great job.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.168
-Thanks, Cap.
-Yeah, that’s awesome.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.586
I think the crew...

34:46.628 --> 34:48.463
I’ve loved working
with everyone so far.

34:48.505 --> 34:49.798
Man, we’re killing it.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.841
It feels so good,
it feels so good.

34:51.883 --> 34:55.178
Okay, so, this is the biggest
tip of the season...

34:55.220 --> 34:58.640
-Whoa!
-Woo-hoo!

34:58.682 --> 35:00.642
$27,500.

35:00.684 --> 35:02.268
-Oh, my God.
-Yay!

35:02.310 --> 35:07.023
Twenty-five hundred dollars a
person, 1,970 euros per person.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.693
-Woo-hoo!
-Wow.

35:09.734 --> 35:10.860
Congrats!

35:10.902 --> 35:12.696
The whole situation
was a little weird.

35:12.737 --> 35:15.782
The nude photo shoots
were, uncomfortable.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.617
Whatever...

35:17.659 --> 35:20.495
I’m here to make money
and not cause problems.

35:20.537 --> 35:21.746
Turn the boat around.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.039
Then you can drink
all you want.

35:23.081 --> 35:25.375
Thank you!

35:25.417 --> 35:26.918
So, should we whack...

35:26.960 --> 35:28.837
-Sundeck, bridge deck aft.
-Sundeck, bridge deck aft.

35:28.878 --> 35:30.213
Two teams.

35:30.255 --> 35:32.298
Look how organized you are.

35:32.340 --> 35:33.633
I love it in here.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.260
This is all today’s uniform

35:35.301 --> 35:36.636
that got literally taken
off a minute ago.

35:36.678 --> 35:38.346
I know, like, you’re killing it.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.520
Yes!

35:47.856 --> 35:49.691
The tuck goes that way, below.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.526
Oh, so, all of a sudden now...

35:51.568 --> 35:52.861
see, this is why I say
"head of housekeeping,"

35:52.902 --> 35:54.404
because you’re good
at what you do.

35:54.446 --> 35:56.239
Me and you discussed
because then it goes

35:56.281 --> 35:58.199
-with the fold of the...
-We discussed?

35:58.241 --> 36:00.326
It goes with the fold
of the blue mat.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.078
The door?

36:02.120 --> 36:03.163
Says head of housekeeping staff.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.539
No, you see, every time...

36:04.581 --> 36:05.832
you’re never allowed
to say that again,

36:05.874 --> 36:07.042
because I got sh--
for that comment.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.626
You will understand...
you understand.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.837
So, you’re not allowed
to say it again.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.422
You know, I’m really waiting
for things to kick off tonight.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.007
It’s gonna be good.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.508
Yeah, I have a feeling
there’s gonna be kick-offs.

36:15.550 --> 36:16.968
-Yeah.
-Tequila, tequila.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.679
-Shot, shot.
-Tequila, tequila.

36:19.721 --> 36:22.891
Do you fancy anybody on board,
other than me?

36:22.932 --> 36:25.518
No, I’m joking.
No, I’m joking...

36:25.560 --> 36:28.396
You have an undiagnosed
case of narcissism.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.108
I think this is Greek mythology.

36:32.150 --> 36:36.571
So, basically, narcissism,
by definition,

36:36.613 --> 36:39.741
it’s a love of oneself so
great that it kills you.

36:41.951 --> 36:43.078
Wow.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.412
----ing hell.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.122
Yeah.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.874
I don’t love myself, so you can
pack that one away right now.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.959
It’s not necessarily
loving the inside,

36:50.001 --> 36:51.878
it’s the exterior,
it’s the vainness.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.047
I don’t love
my exterior, though.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.048
I don’t.

36:55.090 --> 36:56.549
So, that’s why...

36:56.591 --> 36:57.842
You may not love
your exterior...

36:57.884 --> 37:00.387
I... but you sure
do love your posterior.

37:00.428 --> 37:01.429
What does that mean?

37:01.471 --> 37:02.847
I don’t know.

37:02.889 --> 37:03.932
Those words have never
come out of my mouth.

37:03.973 --> 37:05.684
Okay.
Sorry, then I misheard.

37:05.725 --> 37:07.727
I, like, literally the
last person that loves myself.

37:07.769 --> 37:09.479
Okay, that’s
extremely depressing

37:09.521 --> 37:11.981
and we can unpack that later.

37:12.023 --> 37:14.317
Body image, it’s really hard
for me to,

37:14.359 --> 37:15.902
like, suppress that part down,

37:15.944 --> 37:19.614
and he’s literally just,
like ----ing let it roar

37:19.656 --> 37:21.366
in my ----ing brain.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.910
And what pisses me off is he’s
met me for what, three days?

37:23.952 --> 37:26.579
So, he has no idea of
who I am or,

37:26.621 --> 37:27.956
like, what I think of myself.

37:27.997 --> 37:29.791
Be careful what
you say to people.

37:29.833 --> 37:32.043
I’m gonna go dry
the rest down there.

37:44.597 --> 37:45.765
[crying]

37:50.937 --> 37:53.815
I was, like, how many
other people can think that?

37:53.857 --> 37:55.608
No, I promise you, nobody
thinks that, like...

37:55.650 --> 37:56.985
I really don’t think that.

37:57.027 --> 37:58.820
I know, but that’s...
you know yourself.

37:58.862 --> 38:00.238
I’m the least person
who ----ing thinks it.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.990
Don’t take everyone
so seriously, okay?

38:02.032 --> 38:04.993
Maybe I should change
the way I act.

38:05.035 --> 38:07.746
No, man, you don’t need
to change yourself at all.

38:07.787 --> 38:09.831
I’m gonna nap for 30 minutes.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.167
Oh, watch out.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.668
I wanna shag on this bed,
to be honest.

38:13.710 --> 38:17.464
-Quick, let’s go.
-Okay, let’s go.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.299
Is this how it works?

38:19.341 --> 38:21.051
-I thought it...
-Ah!

38:28.141 --> 38:30.769
-[bleep]
-Yo.

38:33.688 --> 38:35.690
Can we talk?

38:35.732 --> 38:38.568
No, honestly,
I’m just being stupid.

38:38.610 --> 38:41.529
-I’m really sorry.
-It’s okay.

38:41.571 --> 38:42.864
No, it’s not, it’s not,

38:42.906 --> 38:45.200
because you really are
an awesome person.

38:45.241 --> 38:47.535
I’ve, like, had so much
fun with you so far,

38:47.577 --> 38:49.621
and I’m really sorry.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.558
I don’t wanna hide it...
I messed up.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.395
I feel like I may have
just gone ahead

39:13.436 --> 39:17.857
and thrown away a relationship
building with Courtney and Mzi,

39:17.899 --> 39:21.069
and I need to admit that
and then try to make amends.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.780
And I feel so bad.

39:32.956 --> 39:34.207
Okay.

39:37.419 --> 39:38.962
You’re crying.
Why are you crying?

39:39.004 --> 39:40.422
Do you wanna come up here?

39:40.463 --> 39:44.175
So, we were on the sundeck,
and he was, like...

39:44.217 --> 39:46.219
he basically like...

39:47.554 --> 39:48.930
Yeah.

39:59.065 --> 40:00.775
I think I was more of
a tomboy, actually,

40:00.817 --> 40:03.111
growing up,
to my mum’s dismay.

40:03.153 --> 40:05.572
She always wanted me
to be, like, super-girly

40:05.613 --> 40:07.699
and I’d be wearing all
my brothers’ old clothes.

40:20.837 --> 40:22.839
I don’t know.

40:24.424 --> 40:28.261
Let’s go out.
We’ll have a good time.

40:28.303 --> 40:30.638
Mi amor!

40:30.680 --> 40:31.848
Baby.

40:31.890 --> 40:33.391
Got a gift for you.

40:33.433 --> 40:36.227
Oh, thanks, babe!

40:36.269 --> 40:37.187
This is too nice.

40:41.691 --> 40:43.360
[burping]
Courtney.

40:43.401 --> 40:45.028
What the [bleep]?

40:46.654 --> 40:48.615
Woo!

40:48.656 --> 40:50.325
[whistles]

40:50.367 --> 40:52.410
I’ve gotta hide my boner,
hold on.

40:52.452 --> 40:54.746
-Oh, wow.
-It’s the queen of the night.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.122
-You ready?
-Yeah.

40:56.164 --> 40:57.957
Get in, losers,
we’re going shopping.

40:57.999 --> 40:59.668
This is like an ear candle.

40:59.709 --> 41:01.336
You burning up?

41:01.378 --> 41:03.630
Oh, my God, my whole nipple’s
sticking out, [bleep] me.

41:03.672 --> 41:05.674
[laughing]

41:05.715 --> 41:07.801
If you ever see my nipple
exposed, can you say something?

41:07.842 --> 41:10.637
-Sure.
-That’ll be great.

41:10.679 --> 41:12.681
[laughing]

41:12.722 --> 41:14.349
Courtney!

41:14.391 --> 41:16.476
Oh, look at
this beautiful place.

41:18.561 --> 41:19.729
Good.

41:19.771 --> 41:21.856
Thanks for fingering me.

41:21.898 --> 41:23.900
I needed that, guys.

41:26.736 --> 41:29.030
Oh, my God, look at these!

41:29.072 --> 41:31.199
Can we order some drinks
to begin with?

41:31.241 --> 41:32.617
I’m gonna stick
to water tonight.

41:32.659 --> 41:35.995
Two beers, three Aperols,
three espresso martinis.

41:36.037 --> 41:37.706
Guys, this is so peaceful.

41:37.747 --> 41:40.166
We’re gonna ruin
this peace so good.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.418
Hi.

41:41.459 --> 41:44.170
I wanted you to know
I appreciate you.

41:44.212 --> 41:45.380
Yeah.

41:45.422 --> 41:47.382
And I’ve only known you for
three days.

41:47.424 --> 41:49.050
I don’t know what you’re facing,
I don’t know what problems,

41:49.092 --> 41:50.427
and I do regret that
I caused any upset with you.

41:50.468 --> 41:52.178
It’s honestly fine.
Like, you had no...

41:52.220 --> 41:53.388
yeah, I mean, you wouldn’t
know that, like, and...

41:53.430 --> 41:54.848
Hold on...

41:54.889 --> 41:56.016
let’s pause here, because
you should love yourself.

41:56.057 --> 41:57.100
-But...
-You are awesome.

41:57.142 --> 41:58.393
-But...
-You are great.

41:58.435 --> 41:59.936
But that’s the thing,
like, it...

41:59.978 --> 42:01.021
You are amazing, and
look at yourself...

42:01.062 --> 42:02.022
you’re ----ing beautiful.

42:02.063 --> 42:03.565
Recognize that, love that.

42:03.606 --> 42:05.275
You didn’t mean to...

42:05.316 --> 42:08.903
you didn’t mean any harm,
and yeah, it’s all G, man.

42:08.945 --> 42:10.488
I mean, I accept his apology.

42:10.530 --> 42:13.074
He didn’t know how bad
it was gonna affect me.

42:13.116 --> 42:15.243
I struggle, like, on
a daily basis to, like,

42:15.285 --> 42:17.996
like what I see in
the mirror and stuff.

42:18.038 --> 42:20.790
Maybe it’s a good thing that
he sees how much

42:20.832 --> 42:21.791
it can affect somebody.

42:21.833 --> 42:23.335
Like, that "one joke."

42:23.376 --> 42:27.630
Just don’t joke about it,
because I’ll cry.

42:27.672 --> 42:29.758
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers.

42:29.799 --> 42:33.428
[chattering]

42:33.470 --> 42:35.847
Cheers to you being a cheeky
mother----ing bitch,

42:35.889 --> 42:37.182
but at least you
speak your mind.

42:37.223 --> 42:38.391
-So, you know what he...
-No... love, love...

42:38.433 --> 42:40.310
-Do you know what he...
-Love, love.

42:40.352 --> 42:41.353
Thank you.

42:41.394 --> 42:43.104
He comes up to me yesterday,
he goes,

42:43.146 --> 42:45.607
"I just wanna tell you now,
I went up to Dave

42:45.648 --> 42:47.942
and I called you a bitch,"
and I was like, "Okay."

42:47.984 --> 42:49.819
No, I wanted to be honest,

42:49.861 --> 42:51.237
because that came out,
like ugly.

42:51.279 --> 42:53.031
I’m glad you’re honest.

42:53.073 --> 42:56.117
No, I told her, I hate like, it
really irritates me, and...

42:56.159 --> 42:57.786
He what?

42:57.827 --> 43:00.205
-Now you’re being a bitch.
-You and Captain Sandy?

43:00.246 --> 43:02.123
-Now you’re being a bitch.
-Who and Captain Sandy?

43:02.165 --> 43:05.502
She stepped in and
she said, "No."

43:07.504 --> 43:08.963
Well, wait, wait, wait...

43:09.005 --> 43:11.800
Don’t talk about a
crewmember in front of me.

43:11.841 --> 43:13.885
-No...
-Behind their back.

43:15.762 --> 43:17.097
-No.
-Are you okay, babe?

43:17.138 --> 43:20.225
-Okay.
-Are you okay?

43:23.269 --> 43:25.146
We’re not discussing work.

43:25.188 --> 43:26.940
We don’t care for discussing
work right now.

43:26.981 --> 43:28.024
Tash, I literally said that
one second ago,

43:28.066 --> 43:29.484
I said I will speak to you guys,

43:29.526 --> 43:30.985
whatever you wanna speak about,
in work hours tomorrow.

43:31.027 --> 43:32.195
No, I’ve got nothing
to speak about.

43:32.237 --> 43:33.321
I told you what
I told you, facts.

43:33.363 --> 43:34.656
-No, you didn’t.
-Yes, I did.

43:34.698 --> 43:36.116
You mentioned...
you missed...

43:36.157 --> 43:37.826
you didn’t mention a few
other things, though.

43:37.867 --> 43:39.411
I’ve got nothing else more to
explain to you than what I did.

43:39.452 --> 43:40.912
Okay.

43:40.954 --> 43:42.664
And you’re getting
nothing else from me.

43:42.706 --> 43:43.915
If you’re looking for attention,
you’re not gonna get it from me.

43:43.957 --> 43:45.500
Looking for attention?

43:45.542 --> 43:47.335
Yeah I told you facts, whatever
Storm told you is bullsh--.

43:47.377 --> 43:49.254
-Kyle, pipe down.
-You’ve been attacking Tash.

43:49.295 --> 43:50.797
I’m literally the most calmest
person sitting here.

43:50.839 --> 43:52.716
-Kyle...
-I’m ----ing calm. Read me.

43:52.757 --> 43:54.509
-Kyle. Kyle.
-Look at you now.

43:54.551 --> 43:56.302
"Look at you now."

43:56.344 --> 43:58.471
-Nat, stop, stop.
-Look at you now, hon.

43:58.513 --> 44:00.473
Don’t... don’t.

44:00.515 --> 44:03.643
This needs to stop,
this needs to stop.

44:03.685 --> 44:05.937
Face your own sh--.
