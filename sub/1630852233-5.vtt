00:05.005 --> 00:06.715
Gooooood morning, Mrs. Howard.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.591
I mean "good morning."
I know you told me

00:08.675 --> 00:11.386
not to elongate my vowels
before we're in school.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.972
- Good morning, Janine.
- Good morning. So --

00:13.972 --> 00:16.057
- Ms. Howard?
- Yes?

00:16.141 --> 00:19.686
Ms. Howard! It is you! Yo!

00:19.686 --> 00:22.105
I would have thought
you would have retired by now!

00:22.105 --> 00:24.190
Yo, I just dropped off
my nephew and --

00:24.274 --> 00:26.151
Yo, you was always
my favorite teacher,

00:26.151 --> 00:27.777
and I never got a chance
to thank you

00:27.861 --> 00:29.738
for everything you did for me
back in kindergarten.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.741
Aw, sweetheart, you don't
have to thank me for that.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.867
You did this.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.827
Of course
I need to thank you!

00:35.827 --> 00:38.163
Before I was in your class,
everyone would have been like,

00:38.163 --> 00:40.665
"Oh, he's gon' be the one
that needs to be secured."

00:40.749 --> 00:43.501
But thanks to you,
I'm out here securing.

00:43.585 --> 00:48.214
Well, I am very proud of you.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.841
By the way, how is your mother?

00:49.841 --> 00:52.469
Well, that's complicated,
but it's gon' mean so much

00:52.469 --> 00:54.637
to my moms that
Ms. Howard asked after her.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.098
Well, sweetheart,
it was so good to see you,

00:57.182 --> 00:59.351
and have a great
rest of your day.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.560
- You, too, Ms. Howard.
- All right.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.811
- You too.
- Bye.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.064
Bye.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.192
See, Mrs. Howard?
That is why we do this.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.693
Mold those young minds.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.613
Just create new lives, make
those connections. That --

01:11.613 --> 01:14.949
Sweetheart, I have no idea
who that young man was.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.451
Morning.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.012
Well, it looks like a classic
Schemmenti good mood day.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.139
You know it!
I got my favorite parking spot,

01:38.223 --> 01:40.183
my macchiato is on point,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.060
and my neighbor
finally found her cat,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.354
so no more hearing her cry
through the walls.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.815
Jacob, are you ready?

01:46.815 --> 01:48.566
I am not just ready,

01:48.650 --> 01:50.402
- I am set and go.
- Yes.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.278
Ready for what? What's going on?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.114
We have this little tradition
where we read

01:54.114 --> 01:56.074
our Grades for Teachers
reviews out loud

01:56.074 --> 01:57.492
when a new one comes in.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.828
Mine are always
just incredibly flattering.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.413
There's a Yelp for teachers?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.081
Yeah. Do you want me
to help you set up a page?

02:03.081 --> 02:04.666
Because as it says here,

02:04.666 --> 02:07.836
I am excellent at explaining
complicated ideas.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.213
Oh, no, thanks.
That just sounds bad.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.589
Hmm.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.258
Oh -- Oh, dang. Found a new one.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.301
- Okay, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.221
What's wrong?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.597
Uh, it's -- it's nothing.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.100
I just got a C-minus review,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.978
which will bring down
my overall average

02:24.978 --> 02:27.731
and
tarnish my reputation forever.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.482
You know? It's like --
It's no big deal, though.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.192
Well, if traditions
were always easy,

02:31.276 --> 02:32.235
everyone would have them.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.778
Everyone does.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.448
"Nice but lacks experience

02:36.448 --> 02:39.034
compared to the other
second-grade teacher at Abbott."

02:39.034 --> 02:41.953
Hey! That's me. The other
second-grade teacher at Abbott.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.331
This isn't that bad.
One of my reviews was so rude,

02:45.415 --> 02:47.250
the superintendent had to
come check on me at home.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.711
Yeah, well, that's you, though.
I don't get bad reviews.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.129
You just did.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.797
Girl, please, stop.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.299
You're gonna make me
spit my coffee out.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.885
Okay, look, ignore this. Reviews
on a poorly designed website

02:56.885 --> 02:58.887
do not determine
what kind of teacher you are.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.638
Yeah, no.
No, I just can't believe

03:00.722 --> 03:03.350
the entire world can read
that I'm a bad teacher.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.810
Hey, kid, listen.
There's nothing wrong

03:05.894 --> 03:07.354
with having some room
for improvement.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.022
Just take it from me...

03:09.022 --> 03:11.775
the other, better, more
experienced teacher at Abbott.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.405
Melissa plays a lot. She jokes.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.032
You know? She's good at it.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.910
Just another thing
she's better at than me,

03:21.910 --> 03:24.537
according to the reviews.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.332
She's a regular Lucille Ball.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.044
Oh, hey, man. Can you tell me
where I can find the mailboxes?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.879
- Oh, I'll show you.
- No, you can just tell me.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.923
No, no, it's good. It's fine.
We can walk together.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.676
Ooh, speaking of mail,
can we talk USPS?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.552
Have you heard of
informed delivery?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.846
What up, ol' curly head
Arthur from PBS looking boy?

03:42.889 --> 03:44.599
And good morning to you, Raheem.

03:44.683 --> 03:45.892
You let them talk to you
like that?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.520
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,
but the boys and I are bonding

03:48.520 --> 03:50.689
in the tradition
of playing the dozens.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.898
It's also called roasting.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.109
Also called, uh,
blazing, frying.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.069
Hmm. Lot of
cooking terminology.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.612
Look, man.
I'm from Baltimore, okay?

03:57.696 --> 03:59.239
All I know is when
somebody roasts you,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.116
you got to roast them back.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.242
Our teachers used to roast us.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.035
If they didn't,
we wouldn't have respected them.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.120
You're just getting clowned.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.872
Of course I'm being clowned,
okay?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.124
I don't know how to roast.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.291
It's not that hard.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.544
You just kind of have to take
what people give you, like...

04:12.544 --> 04:15.714
you ol' mothball-
sweater-vest-looking boy.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.174
Hmm. Simple yet cutting.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.385
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Thank you.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.470
I thought you had to bring
way more to the table.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.139
In the Dean Martin
celebrity roasts --

04:24.139 --> 04:26.057
Where are the mailboxes?

04:26.141 --> 04:28.601
Oh. Yeah. Come on.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.186
All right. Attendance time.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.189
So, raise your hand
if you're not here.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.068
All right.
So Nicole's not here.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.864
Janine, come to my office.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.365
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

04:42.449 --> 04:44.367
All right, everybody,
uh, settle down.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.912
Okay, everyone's who's not here,
please be good, all right?

04:47.996 --> 04:49.122
I'll be right back.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.791
<i>Mm-hmm. She'll be right back.</i>

04:51.875 --> 04:53.793
Can she see me?

04:56.463 --> 04:57.672
Hey, girl.

04:57.756 --> 04:58.882
Hey, Ava.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.550
You know I can't just
leave my classroom

05:00.550 --> 05:02.010
unattended like this, right?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.428
It's five minutes.
It's not like something

05:03.428 --> 05:04.721
could go wrong in five minutes.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.223
A lot can go wrong, actually.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.392
If you say so. Anyway,
one of Melissa's students

05:09.476 --> 05:10.643
will be transferring
into your class.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.854
Really? Why?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.773
Girl, I don't know.
Things happen all day.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.816
Maybe she wants to be closer
to the bathroom.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.109
Maybe she like you more.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.445
Maybe she got some kind
of Meek Mill-Drake feud

05:20.445 --> 05:22.155
going on with one of her
classmates. I don't know.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.656
Maybe she likes me better.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.450
If you really want to know,
you should read her file.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.202
I have them arranged
by sexiest dad.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.205
Her name is Courtney Pierce,
and her daddy is "foine."

05:30.205 --> 05:32.248
No, that's okay.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.792
I don't really like
to read the file.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.210
I like to get to know the child

05:35.210 --> 05:37.003
so I don't have
any preconceived notions.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.756
That's an adorable spin
on choosing to be unprepared.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.966
I wonder how Melissa's doing.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.052
Hope she's not taking this
too hard.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.346
Find out right now.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.682
<i>Melissa, Janine is on her way.</i>

05:48.682 --> 05:50.892
You do know that that's
coming out of all the speakers,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.352
not just a specific
classroom, right?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.603
I said you're on your way.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.860
Looking like Ron Weasley
if he was a pick-up artist.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.613
This man look like
he dream in podcasts.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.826
Well, look at you...

06:07.826 --> 06:09.911
ol' blue shirt...

06:09.911 --> 06:11.788
tan pants wearing guy.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.292
With your bright white shoes

06:16.376 --> 06:19.337
and the laces all tied up
into a little bow?

06:19.421 --> 06:23.133
Yeah. No way those
are accidentally falling off.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.554
Mr. Vampire Weekend,
that really hurt my feelings.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.058
Oh, God.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.852
Raheem, I am -- I am so sorry.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
You should be.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.022
With that
Twilight-shaped mouth!

06:37.022 --> 06:38.690
Ha ha! Got 'im!

06:38.690 --> 06:41.818
That's what we're all wearing.
It's a uniform.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.611
You ain't even observant, dawg.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.282
They say the first year
of teaching is the hardest.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.200
But...

06:49.284 --> 06:51.619
What about the second year?

06:51.703 --> 06:54.372
- Minus $1 equals --
- Hey, Melissa. Hey.

06:54.456 --> 06:55.498
- What?
- Uh, sorry.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.625
I know you talked to Ava,
so this is awkward.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.419
W-Why would it be awkward?

06:59.419 --> 07:03.340
Oh, just the whole your student
preferring me thing.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.467
Oh, yeah, no.
Not awkward at all. Just...

07:05.467 --> 07:07.385
there's a couple things that
you should know about Courtney

07:07.469 --> 07:08.511
before you take her
into your class.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.430
I know you're more experienced
than I am,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.891
but this transfer kind of proves

07:12.891 --> 07:14.768
I've got something special
in my classroom

07:14.768 --> 07:16.895
that's got the kids a-talkin'.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.608
Courtney, come over here, hon.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.069
It's time for you to go with

07:24.069 --> 07:27.072
your very confident new teacher,
Ms. Teagues.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.866
Why don't you go get your stuff?

07:29.866 --> 07:31.451
I'm like the Allen Iverson
of teachers,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.745
and you're like that guy
he stepped over once.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.206
You mean three-time
NBA champion Tyronn Lue?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.957
- That guy?
- Yes, you know basketball,

07:38.041 --> 07:41.961
but my point is,
maybe I'm not a bad teacher.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.172
Maybe you are.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.256
Okay.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.759
Courtney...

07:47.759 --> 07:50.845
I want you to go
and be your wonderful self

07:50.929 --> 07:52.097
with Ms. Teagues, okay?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.224
I have no doubt
that you're gonna have

07:54.224 --> 07:56.393
a great time in her class.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.478
All right.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.021
Have fun.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.192
All right.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.654
Oh, look at you all,
being so well-behaved.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.823
Setting a great example
for our new student.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.990
Hi. I'm Janine.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.867
- Hi, Janine!
- Hi, Janine!

08:12.951 --> 08:15.245
Uh, no. She's not Janine.
Her name is --

08:15.245 --> 08:16.788
My name is Janine Teagues.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.832
- Hi, Janine Teagues!
- Hi, Janine Teagues!

08:18.832 --> 08:19.999
It's not Janine.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.084
Yes, it is.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.253
<i>Courtney?</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:26.089
One of the toughest students
I've ever had.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.758
She's gonna eat Janine alive.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.012
Okay, everyone, please stand
for the Pledge of Allegiance.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.597
Except for Andrew,
who is taking a principled stand

08:34.681 --> 08:35.724
against nationalism.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.559
Yes. All right.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.270
Everyone else? I...

08:40.270 --> 08:43.398
I pledge allegiance to the flag

08:43.398 --> 08:46.151
of the United States
of Courtney.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.863
And to the Courtney
for which it stands,

08:49.863 --> 08:54.534
one nation under Courtney, indivisible,

08:54.534 --> 08:57.996
with Courtney
and Courtney for all!

09:00.498 --> 09:02.959
That's right! Nice job.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.003
That's right. Nice job.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.796
Courtney,
go back to your seat.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.173
But I'm done with all my work.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.257
Go.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.221
Your next word is "smooth."
Go, go, go.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.310
Done!

09:21.561 --> 09:24.230
- "Rebble"?
- It's "ra-bell."

09:27.192 --> 09:28.610
Courtney?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.779
Courtney, please stop.

09:30.779 --> 09:31.863
Courtney.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.115
Just --

09:34.199 --> 09:35.950
Hey. Hi. Can I help you?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.411
Yeah, I just stopped by
to see how Courtney's doing.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.997
Oh, yeah, Courtney is thriving.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.874
Whole class is, actually.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.543
She was the missing piece to
our little puzzle of learning.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.128
Oh. That's great to hear.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.047
I'm surprised you're not
having any problems.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.132
Took me a couple of months
to figure out how to keep her

09:51.216 --> 09:52.509
from disrupting the class.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.177
Look at you doing it
in a couple of hours.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.804
I guess you really are

09:55.804 --> 09:58.306
the superior teacher.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.564
I'm teaching a lesson
on gravity.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.858
Here's a little secret.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.443
Courtney didn't get transferred
out of my class

10:10.527 --> 10:12.153
'cause I couldn't handle her.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.571
She got her parents
to transfer her

10:13.655 --> 10:17.158
because I'd already caught on
to all her little tricks.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.827
Most of them.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.454
Nobody could have seen
that macaroni thing coming.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.248
So I said,
"I'm not giving you a ride.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.458
I'm 'bout to drop you off
at the airport of life."

10:25.542 --> 10:27.585
Oh, I know that's right.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.295
Hey, ladies. Sorry to interrupt.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.547
Uh, you mentioned earlier

10:30.547 --> 10:32.590
that there was a file
on Courtney Pierce?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.884
Yeah. Thicker than a Snicker.
Heavy like a Chevy.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.219
- Ooh.
- Okay.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.971
Are you having issues
with Courtney?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.764
Ah, I wouldn't say --

10:39.848 --> 10:41.933
She need help.
Look at her.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.184
With that "I need help" face.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.603
Okay, this is not
an "I need help" face.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.856
It is an "I have it
under control" face

10:47.856 --> 10:49.899
and arm and leg and --

10:49.983 --> 10:53.194
And that is good,
because I cannot help you.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.239
You see, Ava and I
have placed a modest wager

10:56.239 --> 10:59.492
on your success with
the whole Courtney situation,

10:59.576 --> 11:01.077
and I will not affect
the outcome.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.121
Wait. Hold on. You bet on me?

11:03.121 --> 11:05.415
- Well, yeah.
- You guys are using

11:05.415 --> 11:07.333
my performance as a teacher
for entertainment?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.335
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.213
Okay. That's it. You know what?
I'm taking everybody's money.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.759
Janine, you do know

11:15.759 --> 11:17.719
that that is not
how bets work, right?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.474
Ava, I'm gonna need
to see that file.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.310
Okay. You don't have to say it
all determined.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.770
Nobody's stopping you
from seeing the file.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.522
I offered it to you yesterday.
Just go in the office and look.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.483
Okay.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.530
Hey. How's it going?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
It's -- Yeah.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.133
"Psychological warfare"?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.969
"Could make a good
cult leader someday.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.763
Melissa Schemmenti."

12:01.763 --> 12:05.892
Well, I found Courtney's file,
and it is substantial.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.478
Cannot believe Melissa
didn't tell me any of this.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.106
But now that I'm informed,
I can handle it.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.108
I'm just gonna have to
communicate to Courtney

12:13.108 --> 12:15.777
that this behavior isn't okay.

12:15.777 --> 12:19.155
I bet no one's ever really tried
to talk to her, you know?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.448
Meet her where she's at.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.372
Juice?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.166
Apple juice? Really?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.795
Okay. Um...

12:33.795 --> 12:36.548
Courtney, did you know
the emotional center

12:36.548 --> 12:39.509
isn't actually in the heart
but in the brain?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.386
- Pass.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.763
Okay. Sit down.
Hold on. All right.

12:43.847 --> 12:47.726
You're a leader, Courtney,
and maybe that's something

12:47.726 --> 12:50.895
your other teachers
didn't see about you, but I do.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.649
I know that when you tie your
classmates' shoelaces together

12:54.733 --> 12:56.735
and tell them to dance,

12:56.735 --> 12:58.737
you're just looking
for affirmation.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.573
And, Courtney,
I will affirm you.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.826
We will sit down together,
maybe do a puzzle --

13:04.826 --> 13:07.746
I bet you love puzzles
as much as I do --

13:07.746 --> 13:11.332
and just work through
some of those feelings together.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.794
Okay.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.056
I mean...

13:29.684 --> 13:31.728
So I reached out to her.
You know? Sat her down.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.063
Because at the end of the day,

13:33.063 --> 13:34.397
teaching is just about communicating,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.524
and that's something I live by.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.859
I don't want to compare,
but, like...

13:37.859 --> 13:41.905
Barbara, have you ever been
roasted by your students?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.656
One, they're 5.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.241
Two, they respect me.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.952
Three, what would they even say?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.955
Mm.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.416
Hey. I need to talk.
Like to a friend.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.628
You know how sometimes when
you're being chased by a dog

13:56.628 --> 13:57.962
and you can't tell
if it's playing

13:58.046 --> 13:59.506
or if it's trying to bite you?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.924
- No.
- But at the same time,

14:00.924 --> 14:02.300
you don't want to stop running,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.344
because if it isn't playing,
you're gonna get bit?

14:04.344 --> 14:06.513
Look, I tried
roasting my students back,

14:06.513 --> 14:07.597
and it didn't work.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.017
It got way worse
and oddly specific.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.394
Come on. It couldn't
have been that bad.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.105
They called me "HuffPo-reading
gay Pete Buttigieg,"

14:15.105 --> 14:18.149
which is repetitive
and insulting.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.859
As if I would read a word
of Huffington Post

14:19.943 --> 14:21.277
after Arianna stepped down.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.071
You may just have to
take the L on this one, man.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.989
I mean, you can't really
beat them at their own game.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.076
It's like them
challenging you to...

14:28.076 --> 14:29.577
Dungeons & Dragons.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.205
You can't really
challenge someone to D&D.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.124
It's more like a cooperative
game that's all about

14:34.124 --> 14:35.792
the shared experience
rather than winning.

14:37.669 --> 14:41.881
Thank you, you ol' good
friendship having man.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.220
Is everything okay?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.722
Oh, you tell me.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.724
You got a little sleepyhead
over there.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.768
Do you want to know what I do

14:53.852 --> 14:55.645
when a kid falls asleep
in my class?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.564
- Sure.
- Nothing.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.857
'Cause it doesn't happen.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.108
I keep my kids engaged.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.943
Anyway, do you have a second

15:02.027 --> 15:04.237
for me to show you something
regarding Courtney?

15:06.448 --> 15:07.741
All right, my little eagles.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.285
We're gonna take quiet time
a bit early, okay?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.454
Yes, Ms. Schemmenti.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.289
I know you didn't
pull me out of class

15:14.289 --> 15:15.582
just so you could brag.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.167
No, of course not.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.131
Courtney's teaching us
a new word.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.138
Courtney!

15:31.348 --> 15:33.433
Look away, y'all.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.021
All right, guys,
we're gonna go into

15:38.021 --> 15:40.190
Ms. Schemmenti's class
for a little bit

15:40.190 --> 15:42.192
while Mr. Johnson
cleans the board

15:42.192 --> 15:45.653
because Courtney decided
to use permanent marker

15:45.737 --> 15:47.947
even though dry-erase
was right there.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.784
But she knew that.
She knew that.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.369
I heard there's a bet going.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.371
Is it too late for me
to get in on the action?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.544
I went from having one teacher
to two.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.754
Ain't that some

16:02.754 --> 16:04.339
- Courtney!
- Courtney!

16:04.339 --> 16:06.216
You know, I'm glad
she's in your class now

16:06.216 --> 16:08.510
so you two can throw
your little tantrums together.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.096
I'm sorry.
Was it not a tantrum

16:11.096 --> 16:13.098
when you sent Courtney
to my class

16:13.098 --> 16:15.016
without warning me
about her behavioral issues?

16:15.100 --> 16:17.018
Yes, I saw your notes
in her file.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.812
I did try to warn you,
ya <i>gabbadost,</i>

16:18.812 --> 16:20.397
but you got too big
for your britches

16:20.397 --> 16:22.357
and you didn't want to listen.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.859
Well, maybe if you hadn't been
making fun of me yesterday,

16:24.943 --> 16:26.403
I wouldn't have
gotten defensive.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.030
Janine, I was goofing.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.657
Unlike when you called me
a bad teacher,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.701
something I would never
call you.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.537
You know, I-I know
that review hit you hard,

16:35.537 --> 16:36.913
but I didn't deserve that.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.085
Okay.

16:42.085 --> 16:46.047
I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.508
That review really,
really hurt my feelings,

16:48.508 --> 16:50.260
and I took it out on you.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.761
It wasn't even that bad.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.513
It just said
you were less experienced.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.932
Listen, if you go look
at the Facebook reviews

16:56.016 --> 16:57.851
of my cousin Rocco's
hoagie shop, you would think

16:57.851 --> 17:00.395
the man sold food poisoning.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.731
But he's gonna keep
making hoagies.

17:02.731 --> 17:06.067
You know why?
Most people love them.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.694
You got to keep
making hoagies.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.073
Now, what are we gonna do
about this one?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.204
Thank you for your business.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.664
Ol' I should have been a hooper,

17:19.748 --> 17:21.583
but basketball didn't exist
lookin' boy.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.461
1800s Slenderman in the face.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.379
Okay, while these are hilarious,

17:26.463 --> 17:29.424
let's try and incorporate some
of the lessons into the roast.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.552
Ol' bullet in the head
at Ford's Theatre lookin' boy.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.555
My mans got ain't been sleeping
four score and seven years ago

17:35.555 --> 17:37.015
bags all up under his eyes.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.933
Abe Lincoln.
I'm Abe Lincoln, Mr. Hill.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.353
Yes, yes! Good work, team!

17:45.648 --> 17:49.652
Yeah, I guess, like, thumbs up
is kind of our thing now.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.279
Bye. Don't forget your homework.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.489
- Ms. Schemmenti.
- Yes?

17:52.489 --> 17:53.990
Courtney called me stupid.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.077
No, I didn't. I called you
"stupendous," you idiot!

17:57.077 --> 17:58.661
- Courtney!
- You know what?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.205
I'm just gonna go home
and take a nap,

18:00.205 --> 18:02.165
'cause I'm utterly depleted.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.708
What'd she say?

18:03.792 --> 18:05.251
One thing I will say --

18:05.335 --> 18:07.379
that girl has
a fairly advanced vocabulary.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.297
She corrected my math
last week.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.507
She threw a stapler first,

18:10.507 --> 18:12.258
but she was right
about the math.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.593
You know, when I was
going through Part 2

18:13.677 --> 18:15.387
of Courtney's file earlier,

18:15.387 --> 18:17.722
I realized her grades
have never dropped.

18:17.806 --> 18:18.890
- Mnh-mnh.
- And usually when a kid

18:18.890 --> 18:22.018
is acting out like that,
you see it in their performance.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.937
Yeah.
That's what makes it tough.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.897
Hard to discipline a kid
who's getting straight A's.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.484
All right.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.111
So, what if we rewarded her?

18:33.029 --> 18:35.657
You might be onto something
there, rookie.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.243
Okay, so if B makes it block,

18:38.243 --> 18:40.704
then C makes it what?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.622
Uh, not quite. Try again.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.167
There you go. Good job.

18:46.251 --> 18:49.004
Wow.
You think you know someone.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.922
And then they cheat on you
with their thumb.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.386
Ol' Siskel & Ebert
two thumbs up lookin' ass boy.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.470
Okay.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.557
You want to bump the
Puzzles kid up a grade?

19:00.557 --> 19:02.600
Yes.
After talking to Melissa

19:02.684 --> 19:04.894
about how she was able
to keep Courtney in line,

19:04.978 --> 19:06.771
we realized
the only thing that works

19:06.855 --> 19:08.273
is when she feels challenged.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.357
Are you sure
you're not just trying

19:09.441 --> 19:10.817
to dump Courtney
on another teacher?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.903
No, no, no. I feel that with
a more challenging workload,

19:13.987 --> 19:16.448
Courtney will be much,
much easier to handle,

19:16.448 --> 19:18.700
and she won't have time
to distract her classmates.

19:18.700 --> 19:19.784
Mm-hmm.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.203
Why does that sound so familiar?

19:22.287 --> 19:23.830
Oh. Hold up.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.167
Part 3?

19:27.167 --> 19:29.127
My bad, y'all. She was
supposed to skip second grade,

19:29.127 --> 19:30.879
but they told me
during Essence Fest.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.464
I missed a lot of paperwork
during that month.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.090
Isn't Essence Fest
just a weekend?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.801
Maybe for y'all.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.305
Oh, hey, Barbara!
Nothing to see here.

19:40.305 --> 19:43.600
Just Janine going on and on
about what a handful Courtney is

19:43.600 --> 19:46.519
and how she can't handle
the situation at all.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.979
Is that so?

19:49.189 --> 19:51.149
Fine.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.068
I guess technically
Janine succeeded.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.363
She figured out that Courtney
needs to be bumped up a grade.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.073
Guess you win the bet.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.157
Hmm.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.327
Barbara?

20:02.327 --> 20:03.661
You believed in me?

20:03.745 --> 20:06.289
Janine, why don't you go
handle this transfer

20:06.373 --> 20:08.583
so that your class
isn't any more disrupted

20:08.583 --> 20:10.210
than it already has been?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.671
Okay.

20:14.422 --> 20:15.590
Mm.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.677
It's a heart.

20:18.677 --> 20:21.763
I learned that from Courtney.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.891
I thought Barbara bet
against me, but she didn't.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.143
She actually thinks
I'm a great teacher.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.938
Maybe even better than --

20:29.938 --> 20:33.274
Courtney!
Hey, Courtney! What, get --

20:33.358 --> 20:36.695
How'd you get back
in the building?! Courtney!

20:42.492 --> 20:44.869
It's barely wet.
What you, the CDC?

20:44.953 --> 20:49.082
I will expect some non-brassiere
money from you by tomorrow

20:49.082 --> 20:50.375
because, Ava...

20:50.375 --> 20:51.459
Huh?

20:52.127 --> 20:55.255
You do not want to owe me money.

20:56.631 --> 20:57.882
Hmm.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.889
Ohh. Damn!

21:04.973 --> 21:06.933
Mm.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.397
What?

21:14.566 --> 21:17.485
