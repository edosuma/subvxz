Damn it, Mike.
Mike, back off.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.796
Frank: Oh, shit.
He's making him.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.089
Shit! Fuck!

13:19.174 --> 13:20.507
Hub: All units go!

13:23.052 --> 13:25.596
Look, I got to get
back to you, Judge.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.097
Shit!

[Horn Honks]

13:37.984 --> 13:40.027
Hub: Go around.
Go around, Frank.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.779
I got him, I got him.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.257
Frank: There he is.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.511
We got him.
Stuyvesant and Throop.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.678
Cut him off!

14:13.895 --> 14:14.811
There he is.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.203
Hey, come back, Khalil!

14:31.287 --> 14:32.454
Khalil!

14:39.128 --> 14:41.672
All units, we got a red van

14:41.756 --> 14:44.299
going east on Stuyvesant
off of Vernon. Red van.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.760
Did you get plates
on that, Frank?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.387
Plates? No.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.306
But you got to love
that move.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.724
No plates.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.767
Theyjust found the van.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.519
Doesn't look like
they'll find any prints.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.520
Hub: Vehicle I.D.?

14:56.604 --> 14:57.521
Reported stolen
plates are bogus, too.

14:57.605 --> 14:58.522
What about hair, fiber?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.232
Already on its way
to the lab.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.150
Hub, we're checking
this guy out

15:02.235 --> 15:03.986
in the red book
right now.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.531
Good job, Mike.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.783
It's Floyd Rose.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.076
Go, Floyd.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.744
Floyd: You're not
gonna believe this.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.997
Guess who
just showed up.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.212
How's she living, Floyd?

15:22.297 --> 15:25.257
She's got 2 in a Plymouth,
at least 3 inside,

15:25.341 --> 15:27.342
and see that guy
walking his dog?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.344
He did his business
about an hour ago,

15:29.429 --> 15:30.887
and they're still walking.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.472
I had a dog like that once.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.434
It's not his dog, wet wick.
They're spies.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.645
The dog works for the CIA?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.314
Hub Over Radio:
All units report.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.440
This is unit one.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.608
We're good to go.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.526
Man On Radio:
Unit 2, we're ready.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.944
All right, let's roll.

behind your head.

Hi, guys.
I expect you know the drill.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.519

16:26.361 --> 16:27.736
Hello.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.571
Elise.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.948
I never touched him.

16:32.033 --> 16:32.949
Really?

16:33.034 --> 16:34.743
Well, we're gonna
have to take him

16:34.827 --> 16:36.161
into custody anyway.
Mike, Frank.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.622
What are you gonna charge
him with, jaywalking?

16:38.706 --> 16:41.124
I don't suppose I could have a
little chat with him here first?

16:41.209 --> 16:43.794
I don't think so, Elise.
Not in this lifetime.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.673
You know, Hub—
may I call you Hub?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.299
Yes, you may.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.468
Ifyou guys hadn't blown
the surveillance,

16:51.552 --> 16:52.844
we'd have been able
to follow the money.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.763
What do you say, Khalil?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.431
You would have led us right
to your friends, wouldn't you?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.600
What friends?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.436
Take him out.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.648
What friends, Elise?

17:06.776 --> 17:08.734
What have you got
for me, huh?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.656
Come on. Share something
with me, Elise.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.117
Enlighten me.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.868
You can tell me now,
or you can tell me downtown.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.871
You know, one phone call,
and he's mine.

17:19.955 --> 17:20.955
You know the number.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.126
I have about, uh—

17:24.210 --> 17:25.711
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.962
You have the right
to an attorney.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.003
That's what you also have.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.548
Oh, come on.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.049
Hey, do you have any idea

17:31.134 --> 17:32.384
what you're starting here?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.802
What kind of shit storm
this could turn into?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.179
Kidnapping, obstruction ofjustice,

17:36.264 --> 17:37.347
assault.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.309
Get her out of here.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.437
I love what you've done
with the place.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.900
Frank: So, Elise,

17:48.985 --> 17:50.986
you OK back there?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.405
You don't get carsick
or anything?

17:53.489 --> 17:54.573
Those handcuffs too tight?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.074
Shuf Mountains, right?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.993
Shiite or Sunni?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.953
Wow. You're really good.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.372
She's really good.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.041
So what's going on
here, Elise?

18:05.126 --> 18:06.543
Paint bomb,
was that a warning?

18:06.627 --> 18:09.171
American University of Beirut.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.089
I was there from '79 to '82.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.257
No shit.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.925
Yeah. My father taught
economics. Henry Kraft.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.762
Is there a terrorist cell
operating in the city

18:16.846 --> 18:17.763
that we're unaware of?

18:17.847 --> 18:19.765
It's such a tragedy.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.100
Growing up there
was like paradise.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.518
Like an exotic Paris.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.853
Right, Frank?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.772
Yeah, it's real exotic

18:26.856 --> 18:28.356
on Rikers Island, too.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.358
You know what they do
to women in there?

18:32.987 --> 18:34.613
Mmm, yum.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.782
OK.

[Telephone Rings]

18:41.913 --> 18:43.371
Go.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.300
3 men, definitely armed,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.135
and this time
they're still on the bus.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.804
So no communication
of any kind?

18:58.888 --> 18:59.888
No, no, it's weird.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.306
They're just in there.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.724
Just in there. OK.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.310
See ifyou can get the frequency
of the bus driver's radio.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.311
We'll try and get him
on the phone.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.312
Frank.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.313
Yeah.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.815
Get a couple
of DAT phones, OK?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.066
Make sure they're
secure portables.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.235
Perfect. The negotiator's
on his way.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.528
A couple of techies, too, Frank.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.737
We want sound.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.159
Sir.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.536
There's children on that bus.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.079
We counted about 6.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.041
That gives us something
to work with, then, doesn't it?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.839
Elise: What's happening
out there?

19:33.923 --> 19:36.341
Take her outside
the perimeter, will you?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.263
They've taken another bus,
haven't they?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.264
Hey, talk to me.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.390
You want to talk now.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.558
You want me to be your
friend now. Is that it?

19:44.642 --> 19:46.434
Listen. These guys
are the real deal.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.769
Are they? How do you know?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.272
Is there a terrorist cell
operating in Brooklyn?

19:51.941 --> 19:52.858
Yes.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.526
The blue bus,
was that a warning?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.653
Yes, and I'm afraid
they're gonna blow this one.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.029
How do you know they're
gonna blow the bus

19:58.114 --> 19:59.364
if they haven't
blown it already?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.367
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.286
They haven't asked
for anything, have they?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.708
Frank: The driver's name
is Larry Kaiser.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.042
He says they've got explosives

20:11.127 --> 20:12.210
strapped to their chests,

20:12.295 --> 20:13.628
they've got
automatic weapons,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.422
and he thinks they're
speaking Arabic.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.673
Where the hell
is the negotiator?

20:16.757 --> 20:18.216
The tunnels
got 20-minute delays.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.593
They're working
on both bridges.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.553
OK. Did he say anything else
about the device?

20:21.637 --> 20:22.804
Did he describe it an any way?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.056
Did he talk about cords
or buttons or anything?

20:25.141 --> 20:27.142
No. He didn't say.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.572
Oh.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.990
Oh, God.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.202
They're not here to negotiate.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.495
Meaning?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.748
They were waiting
for the cameras.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.374
They want everybody watching.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.086
You've got
the shooters in place?

20:55.171 --> 20:56.546
Yeah. So?

20:56.631 --> 20:58.256
Use them.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.382
Kill them now.

20:59.467 --> 21:03.261
Look, it's lose-lose
any way you play it.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.680
You want to lose
little or lose big?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.891
I got the marksmen
on the comm.

21:07.975 --> 21:08.975
They're waiting for a clean shot.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.739

here who can translate,

21:35.544 --> 21:36.962

21:37.046 --> 21:39.130
All right.
Put them on the phone.

the start I'm not the boss.

if they understand.

Look, I know you may not
want to talk to me,

22:13.249 --> 22:16.001
but are you willing
to listen to me?

I'm asking you, please,

let the children go?

Thank you very much.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.504
I appreciate your gesture.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.131
The best way
to get what you want

23:03.215 --> 23:05.884
in this situation is to show
yourself to be reasonable,

23:05.968 --> 23:07.385
which you have done.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.304
I appreciate that.
I really do.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.722
This way, kids.
Come on.

Keep going.

Now we got some more
to talk about.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.569
As you can see, I'm unarmed.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.863
I have no weapons.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.451
And what I propose...

23:31.535 --> 23:34.412
is that you let
these people go...

23:34.497 --> 23:35.997
and I'll take their place.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.876
This way you don't have to worry
about pizza deliveries

23:39.960 --> 23:42.462

and forth to the bathroom

they'll disappear.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.026
you'll see the helicopters
are already moving out.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.618
I'm gonna take your silence

24:13.702 --> 24:15.787

considering my offer.

24:21.877 --> 24:22.919
I'll tell you what.

Why don't you just let
the elderly people go?

up there for a long time.

in the past 5 years

26:19.453 --> 26:21.746

earlier today.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.706
Male Reporter:
Beirut came to Brooklyn today

26:23.791 --> 26:26.167
when the worst terrorist
bombing in the United States

26:26.252 --> 26:27.252
since Oklahoma City

26:27.336 --> 26:28.920
took the lives
of more than 25 people—

26:29.004 --> 26:30.296
Second Female Reporter:
Authorities are withholding

26:30.381 --> 26:31.589
the names of those
who died—

26:31.674 --> 26:33.091
Second Male Reporter:
No group has yet stepped forward

26:33.175 --> 26:34.926
to take responsibility
for the blast.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.594
Authorities are refusing
to comment

26:36.679 --> 26:38.763
other than to say
that the investigation

26:38.847 --> 26:40.682
is already well under way.

26:55.781 --> 26:58.032
All right, everybody take a seat.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.955
ASACs, supervisors.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.916
Just got off the phone
with leaders

27:07.001 --> 27:08.459
of the Arab community.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.588
We have their complete
support and cooperation.

27:12.673 --> 27:15.258
They love this country
as much as we do.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.427
They want these criminals
brought to justice

27:17.511 --> 27:19.470
as badly as we do.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.973
Having said that, let me say this.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.184
I want to rumble
every trap, hole, market,

27:25.269 --> 27:27.729

every student organization

27:27.813 --> 27:29.731
that has ever said a bad word
about this country,

27:29.815 --> 27:31.816
I want to know about 'em.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.528
I want you to turn the heat up

27:35.612 --> 27:38.072
under every one
ofyour resources. Every one.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.951
Every snitch,
twist him inside out.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.662
Every source,
turn him upside down.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.331
See what falls
out of his pocket.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.374
Shake the trees,
throw some money at 'em.

27:48.459 --> 27:49.584
Whatever it takes.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.419
I want results.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.671
Call your families,
find a sleeping bag,

27:53.756 --> 27:55.256
because nobody
is going home

27:55.341 --> 27:57.342
until we find a strand
to pull on.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.844
I don't want to see
anybody walking!

27:59.928 --> 28:01.220
You better be running!
What?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.354
- Now, Mike.
- Yeah.

28:09.438 --> 28:10.772
Have you got positive I.D.?

28:10.856 --> 28:12.857
We don't have a positive I.D.
on anybody.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.484
All right.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.235
Oklahoma City.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.364
The first 24 hours

28:19.448 --> 28:21.282
are the only 24 hours.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.243

29:34.523 --> 29:36.357
He says he loves America.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.818
He only wanted to get away
from the security services.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.653
Sure, sure. Tell me
about the money.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.196
[Speaking Arabic]

29:42.281 --> 29:43.364
He's just sorry.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.867
He didn't know he was
doing anything bad.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.622
Tell me about the money!

29:54.418 --> 29:57.003
[Speaking Arabic]

30:00.215 --> 30:02.967
His cousin
introduced him to a man

30:03.051 --> 30:05.470
who promised him $200
for his dowry

30:05.554 --> 30:09.223
if he took the suitcase
to an address in Brooklyn.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.810
He's a mule.

I want to run down
every rental agreement

30:25.782 --> 30:26.824
from every landlord
in Brooklyn.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.618
Hotels, motels, flophouses.

30:28.702 --> 30:29.827
It's cash.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.038
They're the only ones
in America using cash.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.332
We got a positive I.D.
on 5 of the victims so far.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.083
I need a 6-man team.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.502
I have put a lot
of money in this joker.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.711
It's about time
he started earning it.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.296
I don't care about
any convention.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.673
I want to see all
security cam videos

30:42.758 --> 30:45.009
from every nearby ATM,
convenience store, bank.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.053
What's the time difference
between here and Amman?

30:47.137 --> 30:48.262
Uh, 7 hours.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.015
This is a plasmagram
of the SEMTEX used in bus 87.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.351
As you can see,
the signature's identical

30:53.435 --> 30:55.686
to that used
in the army barracks.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.156
Frank: What kind of idents
do we have so far?

31:07.241 --> 31:09.200
We're still checking all
the latents on the computer.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.369

for real-time video.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.079
I need faces, not voices.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.205
If it's international,

31:14.289 --> 31:16.040
we're talking
a $2 million reward.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.042
Yeah, I want a list
of the next 10 targets.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.168
Frank:
Check with Interpol.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.253
Any foreign matter?

31:20.337 --> 31:21.337
We got some shrapnel.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.380
We got to run it
through the lab,

31:22.464 --> 31:24.131
see if it matches
the metal on the bus.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.341
Does the lab stay open

31:25.425 --> 31:27.218
till we find out what
we're dealing with or what?

31:27.302 --> 31:28.386
24 hours. You busy?

31:28.470 --> 31:30.137
What a fuckin' mess.

Excuse me, sir.

31:43.277 --> 31:46.320
Got a hit.
I found him.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.781
This is the list
of the probables.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.157
And that's the hit.

Ladies and gentlemen...

[Clears Throat]

32:02.337 --> 32:05.673
Meet the late, uh,
Ali Waziri,

32:05.757 --> 32:08.009
one of the bombers
of bus 87.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.011
We were able to trace
this sucker

32:10.095 --> 32:12.013
to a, uh...
group in Ramallah.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.307
That's West Bank,
not West Side,

32:14.391 --> 32:16.475
for all you people just
joining us from Nebraska.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.518
Tina.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.521
We pulled his landing card
and his I-94,

32:20.606 --> 32:23.941
so now we know he came in
3 days ago out of Frankfurt.

32:24.026 --> 32:27.612
What we need now is to fill in
the time between his arrival

32:27.696 --> 32:29.280
and the time
of the incident.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.198
We need
all known associations,

32:31.283 --> 32:33.159
and most of all,
we need an address.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.286
Here's the kicker, guys—

32:35.370 --> 32:39.582
Ali Waziri was on
the terrorist watch list.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.292
How'd he
get into the country?

32:41.376 --> 32:42.501
Here it is.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.836
Student visa. J-1.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.087
Now, where's the original?

32:45.172 --> 32:46.172
Probably in his passport.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.173
Where's the passport?

32:47.257 --> 32:48.174
It's in a million pieces.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.175
Where's the copy?

32:49.259 --> 32:50.468
Point of issuance.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.303
Could be American consulate
in Tel Aviv, Amman, Cairo...

that we have

32:54.389 --> 32:55.306
in every consulate

32:55.390 --> 32:57.016
in every city that Frank
just mentioned,

32:57.100 --> 32:58.809
get them on the phone.
I want the visa. Yes?

32:58.894 --> 33:00.353
Sir, they need you in the lab.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.771
I want the visa, Danny.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.107
It's cotton.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.860
Pure unadulterated
Egyptian cotton.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.195
So you're saying
they're Egyptian.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.489
No. What I'm saying is
this is just—

33:11.573 --> 33:14.492
What they use in funerals.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.160
Guy was wearing
a shroud.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.161
The real deal?

33:17.245 --> 33:18.162
That's right.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.164
I'm gonna go have
a little chat

33:20.248 --> 33:21.499
with our new friend.

33:34.429 --> 33:38.349
I thought one phone call
and you were out of here.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.685
Yeah, well,
I didn't make the call.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.355
Why not?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.276
Are you all right?

33:50.904 --> 33:52.947
Yeah. Yeah.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.449
Yeah. A little tinnitus
in the ear.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.465
I need to know
what I don't know.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.676
Yeah, life's too short.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.848
Are you hungry?

34:18.931 --> 34:20.474
Are we ordering in?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.812
The funeral shroud
is the final step

34:24.896 --> 34:27.273
in the ritual of
self-purification.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.900
First, a fast, then—

34:29.985 --> 34:31.902
The washing of the body,
then the shroud, right.

34:31.987 --> 34:34.029
I saw it on 60 Minutes.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.072
Tell me something
I don't know.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.283
In March,

34:37.367 --> 34:40.077
we identified the man
we believed responsible

34:40.161 --> 34:42.955
for bombing
the army barracks last year.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.623
In August, he went to Lebanon
where he was extracted.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.043
Extracted?
Extracted by whom?

34:50.005 --> 34:52.005
I see.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.050
His name's Sheik Ahmed Bin Talal.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.260
He's Iraqi.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.262
He's something
of a religious leader.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.598
With something of
a devoted following?

35:00.682 --> 35:02.641
Hmm.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.019
OK, I can understand

35:05.103 --> 35:07.730
why we wouldn't want
to advertise the fact

35:07.814 --> 35:10.441
that, uh, our government's
in the kidnapping business,

35:10.525 --> 35:12.777
but why not let us know?

35:12.861 --> 35:14.153
Well, he's still
being debriefed.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.780
They don't want to go public
with the charges.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.656
What about his followers?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.158
Well, clearly they're committed.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.201
Meaning?

35:20.285 --> 35:22.411
I n this game,
the most committed wins.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.246

35:38.220 --> 35:40.179
His name is Samir Nazhde.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.306
He teaches Arab Studies
at Brooklyn College.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.684
He's the one who sponsored
Ali Waziri's student visa.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.728
And dig this—

35:47.813 --> 35:51.649
His brother blew up
a movie theater in Tel Aviv.

35:51.733 --> 35:55.653
You might consider
leaving him alone.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.989
Why would we
consider that?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.200
Well, you can play him
like a cop

36:01.284 --> 36:03.369
and haul him in now
and get your arrest,

36:03.453 --> 36:04.495
or you can tag him,

36:04.579 --> 36:06.497
let him lead you
to the really big fish.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.584
You're fishing, and he's
getting visas for bombers.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.169
You ever heard of
catch-and-release?

36:12.254 --> 36:15.172
M m-hmm. And he's on
the first plane to Tunis.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.804
[Sighs]
Hub.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.434
Hub, now's the time.

36:29.771 --> 36:30.896

36:56.298 --> 36:57.548
I'm a federal agent.

36:57.632 --> 36:59.258
We have reason to believe
that you're an accessory

36:59.342 --> 37:00.676
in the bombing of bus 87.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.220
Are you crazy?

37:03.305 --> 37:05.055
You were an associate
of Ali Waziri.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.766
Sir, I know nobody
of that name.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.852
You sponsored
his student visa.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.104
I sign these applications
as a matter of course.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.898
Hundred of them.
You know how it is.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.900
Everybody wants
to come to America—

37:15.984 --> 37:18.402
You spent 2 years in Israeli
jails during the intifada.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.404
Well, yeah, I did,

37:20.488 --> 37:23.908
but the only ones who didn't
were women, like you.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.659
Ay!

You're going downtown, my friend.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.380
You cannot harm me.
I know my rights.

37:38.465 --> 37:41.300
Defrauding the I.N.S.
is a federal offense.

Reservation for one, please.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.807
We need a search warrant on Samir.

37:50.143 --> 37:53.062
Frank, let me talk
to you for a second.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.943
You ever hit a prisoner again,

37:59.027 --> 38:00.194
I'm gonna have your badge.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.906
Someday I'll tell you
what his people

38:03.990 --> 38:05.950
did to my village in '75.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.785
All right, all right.
You're preaching to the choir.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.954
Just don't do it again.
All right?

38:10.038 --> 38:12.206

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.753
All I know is
that we must respond.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.171
That's an excellent
idea, Senator.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.672
How do we do that?

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.216
Find out who they are
and bomb the shit out of them.

01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:20.676
And ifwe can't find out?

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:24.096
I hate to be the voice of doom,
but it keeps escalating.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.349
First a bus, then a theater.
What's next?

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.642
How about sending in
the National Guard?

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:31.312
The National Guard is
for riot control, Senator,

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:32.521
not for counterterrorism.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.024
The army then. I've read
the contingency plans.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.151
It's established legal doctrine—

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.903
Posse Comitatus.

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:40.946
The army can't be turned
against our own people.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.824
Even if that's what are own
people are asking for, 3 to 1 ?

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.576
If the president's willing
to declare a state of-

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.662
President Lincoln declared
martial law in 1862.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:50.289
He suspended habeas corpus.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:51.707
Which the Supreme Court

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:53.918
later found unconstitutional.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.044
Ex parte Milligan.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.712
And I've got an election
in November—

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.339
Ex-United States congressman.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.841
Let's save the quips for
the Sunday morning talk shows.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.635
The president's plane
lands in 2 hours,

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.221
and we owe it to him
to have a consensus.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.765
You don't fight a junkyard dog
with A.S.P.C.A. rules.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.642
What you do is
you take the leash

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:13.062
offyour own bigger,
meaner dog.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.063
General.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:16.941
The army's a broadsword,
not a scalpel.

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.109
Trust me, Senator,

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.361
you do not want the army
in an American city.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.362
But hypothetically,

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.489
how long would it
take you to deploy?

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.824
You know we can't go in

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.159
until the president invokes
the War Powers Act.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.244
I understand that, General.

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:29.954
Let's assume for a moment

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.539
that the order
has been given.

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:34.583
12 hours after the president
gives the order,

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:37.294
we can be on the ground.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:40.506
One light infantry division
of 10,700 men.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.842
Elements of the Rapid
Deployment Force,

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.219
Special Forces, Delta,

01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:48.139
A.P.C.s, helicopters, tanks,

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:52.768
and, of course, the ubiquitous
M-16 A-1 assault rifle.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.187
A humble enough weapon until
you see it in the hands of a man

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.565
outside your local
bowling alley or 7-11.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:03:01.110
It will be noisy,
it will be scary,

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:03.779
and it will not be mistaken
for a VFW parade.

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:05.448
I remind you,
General Devereaux

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.992
does not speak for
official army policy.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.785
A police function
has become accepted

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.538
as our role in Haiti
and Somalia.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.625
Make no mistake.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.627
We will hunt down
the enemy,

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.296
we will find the enemy,

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.547
and we will kill the enemy.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.508
And no card-carrying member
of the ACLU

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:27.761
is more dead set against it
than I am,

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.763
which is why I urge you...

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:33.934
I implore you...

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.895
do not consider this
as an option.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:41.233
I knowjust what
the president's going to say.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.403
That's exactly why you're
the only man for the job.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.655
I'd like to introduce
Anthony Hubbard.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.158
He's my ASAC on the ground
up in Brooklyn.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:52.995
His team was able to take out
the first cell within 36 hours

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.747
of the attack on the 87 bus.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.665
He's also the man
who took out the terrorist

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.167
in that schoolhouse.

01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.293
Hub.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:04.048
The job of the FBI is to...

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:05.466
to respond.

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.302
The job of the army— to defend.

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.179
With the presence
of the army,

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:13.474
our ability to investigate
will be seriously inhibited.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.268
It will push these criminals
further underground.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:17.978
Most importantly,
you can't fight a war

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.605
against an enemy
you can't see.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:23.817
I think ifwe exercise
patience, restraint,

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:26.862
allow our men and women
up in New York

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:28.364
to do theirjob...

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.534
I think we'll be effective.

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:35.162
Thank you, Agent Hubbard.

01:04:35.247 --> 01:04:37.206
I, too, think that we should
proceed with caution.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.250
Some ofyou may not know
Sharon Bridger.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:40.793
Sharon was posted in Iraq

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.586
as part of
our covert operations

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:44.338
during the GulfWar.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:46.215
Sharon.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.550
Sir, if I may.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:48.926
Thank you.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:03.983
I'm sure everyone here

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.236
knows the traditional model
of the terrorist network.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.030
One cell controls
all others.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:11.574
Cut off the head,
the body will wither.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:14.827
U nfortunately, the old wisdom
no longer applies.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.621
The new paradigm
is each cell

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:19.748
operates independent
of the other.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:23.419
Cut off one head,
another rises up in its place.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.547
Bus 87 was the work
of the first cell

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:29.508
whose remaining elements,
we believe,

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.135
the FBI took down.

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:35.806
This then activated
the work of cell 2.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.434
The theater gala.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.519
At the most,
we believe, there are 3,

01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:41.895
possibly 4 cells.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.606
Well, then how much longer

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:46.692
before we can take out
the last cell?

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:52.948
We don't know.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:02.291
Male Reporter: This is a tragedy
of staggering proportion.

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:04.460
One Federal Plaza
was the headquarters

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.254
of the FBI Counterterrorism
Task Force,

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:09.131
as well as many other
federal agents...

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:10.424
Female Reporter:
Authorities are withholding

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.301
the names of those who died.

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.053
Male Reporter: The worst
in New York City's history.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.220
The most devastating...

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.430
Second Newsman:
Letters of condolence

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.849
have been received from
leaders around the world.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.976
Boris Yeltsin forwarded
a message...

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:33.697
Body count's a little
over 200 so far.

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.826
What about our people?

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:39.995
Mike, Tina.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.289
They were all
in there working.

01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:46.877
Hub.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.547
This is Colonel Hardwick,
Army I ntelligence.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.550
Colonel.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:57.763
I'm here as an adviser only.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.515
I intend to keep
a low profile.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.850
Appreciate your concern.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.480
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.942
but, uh, just what exactly are
your capabilities at this point?

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:13.195
Your infrastructure?

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:14.947
You're standing on
our infrastructure.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.120
Excuse me.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.713
Hey, Hub,

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.089
they managed to get
a partial VI N number

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.340
off the van.

01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:35.008
DMV says it was reported
stolen the day before...

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.760
In Brooklyn?

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:37.970
You got it.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.098
Hub, the final body count
just came in.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.059
600 dead.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:53.110
[Doorbell Buzzes]

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:02.870
I'm very sorry
about your friends.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.918
Frank, it's, uh...

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:11.128
Sharon.

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.755
I didn't catch
your last name, Sharon.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.590
Bridger.

01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:15.674
How you doing, Frank?

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:16.759
Been better.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:18.844
[Sighs]

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.554
Well...

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:22.723
the agency came up with
another list of probables.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.475
I think we should
circulate them.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.187
Hey...

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.063
this stuff might be good.

01:08:30.148 --> 01:08:31.689
Why was there
no warning from Samir?

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.776
Because he didn't
know anything.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:35.277
Says Samir.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.944
Says me.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.613
Maybe I'll ask him.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.698
Yeah, over my dead body.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.701
Over 600 dead bodies.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.286
Look, he's one
of the good guys, OK?

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.287
How can you be so sure?

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.955
Because he was part
of the operation

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.082
to destabilize
Saddam Hussein with me, OK?

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.460
Samir is a go-between.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:53.127
He risked his life
for us over there.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.630
Go-between who, Sharon?

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.174
Look, come on.
I need names, OK?

01:08:57.258 --> 01:08:59.801
I need—I need photographs
or something, OK?

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:00.803
I don't need
a history lesson.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:01.929
I can't give you pictures

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.013
because I don't know
what they look like.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:04.139
We did everything
at arm's length.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.140
So you got nothing?

01:09:05.225 --> 01:09:06.265
I've got Samir.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.268
Well, does Samir have
any contact with them?

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.310
Minimal.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.479
So how does he do it?

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.106
He can't. They initiate.

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.483
And otherwise?

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:15.734
He's waiting.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.569
He's—He's waiting?

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:18.569
What the hell
is he waiting for?

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.029
More bodies?
More buildings?

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:21.782
We got a lot of buildings
out there.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.116
Maybe he's waiting to blow up
a few more of them.

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.660
Hey, look, I know
how you must feel.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.453
Hey, look, you don't
know how I feel.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.330
I lost friends
of mine tonight.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.581
You don't know how I feel!

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.001
They'll make contact soon.

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:35.045
When? That's what I want
to know—When?

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.630
Why soon?
Why not now?

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:38.881
What is the trade craft?
What are the visuals?

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:39.925
What are the iron sights?

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:42.261
You know, all that

I'm going to take
your boy Samir downtown,

I'm going to strap his ass
to a polygraph machine,

Do we need to bring the army
into this, Arianna?

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.281
Absolutely. How many

bring the army...

This is a time of war.

The fact that
it's inside our borders

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.766

it's a new kind of war.

that freedom

that we have him.

a little advice, Steve.

Narrowing the target
to 15,000 suspects.
