WEBVTT

00:18.919 --> 00:20.488
Stella?

00:20.588 --> 00:21.822
We got to get Theo to school.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.335
Excuse me.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.138
What floor?
Uh, six, please.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.007
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what's gotten

00:40.108 --> 00:42.276
into her this morning.
Oh, no worries at all.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.079
You're just trying to
protect your mom, huh?

01:23.951 --> 01:25.619
Good morning.
Good morning...

01:25.719 --> 01:28.156
and apologies in advance.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.458
What happened?
Kate insisted

01:30.558 --> 01:32.326
we try this new café
that serves

01:32.426 --> 01:34.262
"Chagaccinos."

01:34.362 --> 01:36.164
Come again?
Super healthy

01:36.264 --> 01:37.598
mushroom lattes.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.999
She's obsessed,
and she wants me to be, too.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.568
Like liquified mushrooms.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.936
Sounds gross. Agreed.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.672
But Kate and I
are in a really good place.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.340
I don't want
her need to be healthy

01:46.440 --> 01:48.909
to get in the way of that,
so drink up.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.744
Ugh.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.646
It tastes like compost.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.449
I promise I'll make it up
to y'all.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.717
I doubt it.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.352
Boss wants to see you,
by the way.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.987
I'm not that late, am I?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.158
Agent Boone.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.793
Alone?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.497
He tell you what he needs?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.833
All right, yeah,
I'll be right there.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.903
Morning, Lucy.
Have a seat.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.471
Here you go.
Before you say anything,

02:17.571 --> 02:19.106
I know I'm late and I'm sorry.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.543
I had a hectic morning,
but that's not an excuse...

02:22.643 --> 02:24.512
Well, I wouldn't have
even known you were late

02:24.612 --> 02:25.713
if you hadn't just told me.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.615
And you're not in trouble.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.583
Then why did you shut the door?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.153
Yeah.
Um...

02:33.254 --> 02:35.823
Because...

02:35.923 --> 02:38.692
you were just awarded the
Special Agent Afloat position

02:38.792 --> 02:40.461
aboard the <i>Ronald Reagan.</i>

02:40.561 --> 02:41.962
Congratulations.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.932
How? When...

02:45.032 --> 02:47.668
When I applied last year,
they turned me down.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.102
Well, there was a medical
emergency with the current agent

02:49.203 --> 02:51.772
who had to be evac'd,
so your name popped up

02:51.872 --> 02:53.974
to the top of the list
as a replacement.

02:55.108 --> 02:58.145
Is there any way we could
unpop it?

02:58.246 --> 02:59.880
I-I don't mean to be

02:59.980 --> 03:02.015
ungrateful
after you supported me

03:02.115 --> 03:04.184
through the whole application
process last year.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.119
And I-I was

03:06.220 --> 03:08.956
so excited about the prospect
of being the sheriff

03:09.056 --> 03:12.993
of a floating
5,000-person town...

03:14.628 --> 03:16.930
But life is just
a little different now.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.503
I know it's not easy
leaving your life behind.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.505
Okay? Even just temporarily.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.774
Look, I struggled

03:26.874 --> 03:29.777
every time a mission
took me away from my kids.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.181
I just don't want
any regrets.
I get that.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.651
But, look, this is a door
that swings both ways.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.254
Being an agent afloat,

03:40.354 --> 03:42.390
this could be good
for your NCIS career.

03:42.490 --> 03:47.661
Is that your way of saying,
"Not going isn't an option"?

03:49.430 --> 03:52.833
This is my way of saying
I need an answer by tomorrow.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.136
They want you
in Singapore next week.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.647
Hey, Brooksy. Where is he?
Hey.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.216
Over there.
Okay. Thanks.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.051
Theodore?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.920
I go by Theo.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.489
I'm Special Agent
Jesse Boone.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.924
I go by Jesse.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.592
The guard told me
that you rode your bike

04:18.692 --> 04:20.093
all the way here
from Waikiki?

04:20.193 --> 04:22.296
Yeah. I can't get
a phone until I'm 12,

04:22.396 --> 04:24.598
so I don't have Uber
or anything.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.266
Are you the boss?

04:26.367 --> 04:27.401
Not quite.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.970
But I'm still
very good at my job.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.306
How can I help you?
I need to report
a missing person.

04:32.406 --> 04:35.042
My mom didn't come back
from her run this morning.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.710
And my stepdad
is on a submarine

04:36.810 --> 04:38.145
and said we should
come to Pearl

04:38.245 --> 04:39.947
if we needed help.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.249
Okay, how long
has she been gone for?

04:42.350 --> 04:43.417
A couple hours.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.185
And I know
it's not official

04:45.285 --> 04:47.120
until someone's missing
for 24 hours,

04:47.220 --> 04:49.390
but Google also says you should
contact law enforcement

04:49.490 --> 04:51.425
if you're worried about
a person's welfare.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.760
And I am.

04:52.860 --> 04:53.927
What makes you think

04:54.027 --> 04:55.062
she isn't just out
running an errand?

04:55.162 --> 04:57.197
Because Stella
came home alone.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.966
Stella?

04:59.066 --> 05:00.368
Our dog.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.102
She was, she was scratching
at the front door,

05:02.202 --> 05:04.071
but Mom wasn't with her.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.075
Jesse, you have to
go find her.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.511
I'm gonna get right on it.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.480
But before I can do that,

05:12.580 --> 05:13.814
have you eaten?

05:13.914 --> 05:17.117
'Cause I microwave
a mean breakfast burrito.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.822
Come on.

05:29.497 --> 05:33.000
Hey, I got the kid set up
in the conference room.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.069
Did you reach his stepdad?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.005
He's on a sub off
the coast of Myanmar

05:38.105 --> 05:40.374
and there's no nonessential
communications allowed.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.410
Any other guardians listed?

05:42.510 --> 05:43.644
No.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.745
I notified
the Command Ombudsman

05:44.845 --> 05:45.946
and they're ready to send

05:46.046 --> 05:47.681
a Family Advocacy rep
to take Theo

05:47.781 --> 05:50.551
into custody if we don't track
down his mom by the end of day.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.952
Did Kai and Lucy
turn up anything

05:52.052 --> 05:53.186
at the family's apartment?

05:53.286 --> 05:54.688
Not yet.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.357
But that might be because
Theo asked them to fill up

05:57.458 --> 06:00.260
the dog's water dish while
they're there.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.096
He forgot to before
he rode his bike over here.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.933
Pretty responsible
11-year-old.
Yeah.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.869
I keep picturing Jake
in his shoes, you know.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.404
I think he'd be
freaking out.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.773
So I want to
reassure him, but...

06:12.873 --> 06:14.675
I don't want to lie
to him either.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.878
Well, listen, it's best
to not say anything

06:17.978 --> 06:19.880
until we know
exactly what happened.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.682
If it's a simple explanation,
there's no need

06:21.782 --> 06:22.916
to worry him.

06:23.016 --> 06:26.086
If it's not,
it's better to be specific.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.855
Yeah.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.960
So, what did
the building manager say?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.563
Uh, he knows zilch
about the Acostas.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.598
Barely sees them.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.766
But he says they pay
their rent on time,

06:38.866 --> 06:39.933
they never submit
work orders,

06:40.033 --> 06:41.769
so he gives them
a thumbs up.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.805
Did you find anything
at the apartment?
No, nothing of interest.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.674
The next-door neighbors
aren't much help either.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.076
Just said that
Allie's dog gets so excited

06:49.176 --> 06:51.679
about their morning jog
it wakes up the whole floor.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.246
Oh, this is why
cats are better.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.415
Owning a cat is like having
a psychopathic roommate

06:55.516 --> 06:57.518
who destroys your furniture.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.019
And they're loyal
only to themselves.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.654
Cats are <i>very</i> loyal.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.890
They're just more... discerning.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.157
Okay, what about
this case?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.059
You really think a cat
would look for help

07:06.159 --> 07:07.661
if its owner
was kidnapped?

07:07.761 --> 07:08.896
I think you're giving
Allie's dog

07:08.996 --> 07:10.197
a little more credit
than she's due.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.999
She just came home.
She didn't call 911.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.668
You're right.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.604
Ah, that's the fastest
I've ever won

07:16.704 --> 07:17.671
the "cat versus dog" debate.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
No, no, no.
The home part.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.042
Stella rode
the elevator, right?
Yeah.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.944
So unless she knows
which floor she lives on,

07:24.044 --> 07:25.979
either Allie or someone
who knows her

07:26.079 --> 07:28.181
took the dog upstairs.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.718
Uh, building manager's
sending CCTV footage

07:30.818 --> 07:31.952
to Ernie as we speak.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.253
So that'll show us
what happened.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.688
Okay.
Oh, and for
the record...

07:34.788 --> 07:35.689
Mm?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.857
...cats would know

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
which floor they live on.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.063
Why are we using
a tiny screen

07:43.163 --> 07:45.065
instead of the big monitor
the government provided?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.835
Because her son is sitting
in the conference room.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.870
Maybe it's better he doesn't
see what you've got,

07:49.970 --> 07:51.739
which I hope
is something helpful. Yep.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.140
There's your guy.
How can you be so sure?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.142
Because of what happens next.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.014
Dogs are experts
at nonverbal communication.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.516
She's reading
the man's pheromones

08:02.616 --> 08:03.884
and body language like a book,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.286
knows the guy is bad news
before Allie does.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.421
This is why I bring Pepper
on all my first dates.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.158
No better way
to vet potential lovers.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.226
Please don't
call them lovers.
Please tell me you have

08:13.326 --> 08:15.228
something more
than a barking dog.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.064
He was casing
the building from his car

08:17.164 --> 08:18.365
for the last couple of days.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.467
Did you run the plates?
Car's a rental.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.003
Did the company send over
the rental contract?
Yep, along with a picture

08:23.103 --> 08:24.437
of the guy's
driver's license.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.006
Name's Mitchell Smith.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.876
I'll work on
getting a real ID.
No need.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.978
This is his real ID.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.345
Which is kind of a relief

08:32.445 --> 08:33.914
because, you know,
using a name as boring

08:34.014 --> 08:35.716
as "Mitchell Smith"
as your alias is just...

08:35.816 --> 08:36.717
sad?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.385
In any case,

08:38.485 --> 08:40.554
he's one of 72 other
Mitchell Smiths living

08:40.654 --> 08:42.422
in the greater Chicago
metropolitan area.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.859
But ours flew in
from O'Hare four days ago.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.595
So he came to Oahu
to kidnap someone.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.997
Why isn't he
covering up his tracks?
You can ask him directly.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.065
According to
his rental contract,

08:52.165 --> 08:54.367
he's turning
the car in today.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.945
Freeze!

09:05.045 --> 09:07.014
NCIS. Put your hands up.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.616
What the hell
is this all about?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.450
We're looking for
a missing person.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.019
Allie Acosta.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.553
We have reason to believe
you know her whereabouts.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.056
She's in the trunk.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.226
You know that makes you
incredibly guilty.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.828
I'm a licensed bounty hunter.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.763
An officer of the law,
just like you.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.134
You need to surrender her immediately.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.269
Allie Acosta is dangerous.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.604
Look at my eye.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.141
All right.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.212
What the hell?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.513
She was just right...

09:40.614 --> 09:41.514
Wait!

09:50.223 --> 09:51.759
So we show up
to rescue Allie

09:51.859 --> 09:53.661
only for her
to run away from us.

09:53.761 --> 09:57.097
Starting to look like
she doesn't want to be helped.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.573
Cuffs? Seriously?

10:06.674 --> 10:08.375
On what grounds
are you holding me?

10:08.475 --> 10:10.443
How about
unlawful imprisonment?

10:10.543 --> 10:11.945
Oh, please.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.481
I handle myself with
the upmost professionalism.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.985
I approached her calmly,
explained who I was.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.486
Showed her my license
when she asked.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.021
And how do you think
she responded?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.490
By punching me in the face
and trying to get away.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.958
Again.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.995
Something tells me
he deserved it.

10:29.763 --> 10:33.100
Allie Acosta is not
who you think she is.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.102
So, who is she, exactly?

10:35.202 --> 10:38.038
Allison Perez,
a white-collar criminal.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.607
Used to be a controller
at an insurance firm,

10:40.708 --> 10:42.976
where she was stealing
tens of millions of dollars

10:43.076 --> 10:45.178
until the FBI
finally caught up to her.

10:45.278 --> 10:48.015
Then she skipped town
the moment she got out on bail.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.984
And I've been on her tail
ever since.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.853
Over ten years.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.656
Almost caught her in Cleveland
about eight years ago,

10:56.757 --> 10:58.191
but she got away.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.592
How'd you find her here?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.094
One misplaced phone call

11:01.194 --> 11:03.463
after a death in the family
gave her away.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.965
I let the bondsman know

11:05.065 --> 11:07.868
and I hopped the first flight
to Honolulu.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.705
You travel alone
or with a partner?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.807
If a bounty hunter
needs a partner,

11:13.907 --> 11:15.342
he's not very good at his job.

11:15.442 --> 11:19.212
Maybe you could
benefit from a coworker

11:19.312 --> 11:20.814
'cause from where I sit,
all you seem to do

11:20.914 --> 11:22.783
is catch and release.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.584
You know, if it weren't
for you people,

11:24.684 --> 11:27.755
I'd have Allie halfway back
to Chicago by now.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.390
NCIS cost me 100 grand.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.325
That's not our problem.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.161
What do you want from me?

11:35.462 --> 11:36.563
Your cooperation.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.398
With what?

11:38.498 --> 11:40.300
Look, you're right.
We have no grounds to hold you.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.370
But you essentially kidnapped
a mother with a minor son

11:43.470 --> 11:45.572
without letting her make
arrangements for his care.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.975
So when you find Allie,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.577
you have to let
NCIS know right away

11:50.677 --> 11:52.479
so we can place her son
with a guardian.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.147
So you want me to do
the legwork,

11:54.247 --> 11:57.117
and then just
hand her over to you?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.087
Just to resolve
the custodial arrangements.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.055
Once that's done,

12:02.155 --> 12:06.126
you are free to bring Allie
back to Chicago and get paid.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.062
Yeah. Okay.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.630
Fine.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.237
Hey, since you guys let Allie
get away with my car,

12:17.337 --> 12:20.140
could you give me a ride
to the rental place?

12:23.510 --> 12:24.812
Got it.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.215
We can't just wait for Smith
to find Allie Acosta.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.516
Yeah, something tells me

12:29.616 --> 12:30.818
he's not gonna
honor our agreement

12:30.918 --> 12:34.187
if he finds Allie first.
Key word being "if."

12:34.287 --> 12:35.889
He's gonna have
a hard time finding her

12:35.989 --> 12:37.457
now that his cover's
been blown.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.392
For all we know, she could
already be off the island.

12:39.492 --> 12:42.029
Won't be easy for her to get a
flight with the BOLO we issued.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.630
And do you really think
that she would leave

12:43.730 --> 12:46.166
without her son?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.503
I hope not.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.807
I don't want to have to tell
Theo that his mom skipped town.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.142
Okay, well, don't get
his hopes up.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.844
Finding Allie
is gonna be though.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.013
She's been a fugitive
for 11 years.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.849
She must've had
a contingency plan

13:01.949 --> 13:03.383
if the law ever
caught up with her.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.352
Yeah. So, what's next?

13:06.854 --> 13:08.221
We're gonna loop Whistler in.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.423
Get the FBI involved.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.625
Allie is a fugitive
who's crossed state lines,

13:12.725 --> 13:14.227
so this is their
jurisdiction, too.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.562
I'll read her in.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.097
In the meantime,
I'm gonna have Ernie build

13:17.197 --> 13:19.967
a full criminal profile
on the real Allison Acosta

13:20.067 --> 13:21.201
or Perez.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.635
At least that way
we'll have an idea

13:22.735 --> 13:23.636
of what to look for.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.972
Sounds like a plan, boss.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.407
After I'm done on the phone,
I'll talk to Theo

13:27.507 --> 13:29.342
and bring him
up to speed gently.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.944
Okay.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.784
We had just gotten to Japan

13:37.885 --> 13:39.786
and all my buddy Blake
and I wanted to do

13:39.887 --> 13:42.990
was just get off the damn ship
for a few hours at least.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.824
So we were about
to disembark

13:44.925 --> 13:47.360
when some genius below deck
decides to use

13:47.460 --> 13:49.096
a fire main pipe
as a ladder.

13:49.196 --> 13:53.266
Was this due to a Navy
ladder shortage or laziness?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.302
Oh, laziness, for sure.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.603
So thanks to that,

13:56.703 --> 13:59.706
and the fact that
the dude was, he was huge,

13:59.806 --> 14:01.608
Whole pipe buckled
under his weight,

14:01.708 --> 14:03.443
triggering an automatic
emergency dump

14:03.543 --> 14:05.778
of the bilge tanks.
Oh, that doesn't
sound good.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.015
Oh, the whole ship
listed 45 degrees.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.549
Blake almost fell overboard.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.184
I'll never forget
the look on his face.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.353
When I said I wanted to know
what life's like at sea,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.823
I didn't mean an exhaustive
list of the dangers.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.926
Come on. You knew what
you were getting into, right?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.693
Sure, but I didn't know

14:20.793 --> 14:22.829
it'd feel like being
one sardine in a giant,

14:22.930 --> 14:25.865
rocking tin filled with
5,000 other queasy sardines,

14:25.966 --> 14:27.500
which is what
you're describing.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.836
Wait...

14:29.937 --> 14:33.206
Something tells me
your concerns are less to do

14:33.306 --> 14:35.742
with being at sea,
and more to do with Whistler.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.180
What's she think
about all this?

14:40.280 --> 14:44.918
I kind of haven't
100% told her yet.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.819
Why are you coming
to me before her?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.688
Because I want to
figure out how I feel

14:48.788 --> 14:50.623
before dealing
with how Kate feels.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.994
Okay, well, um...

14:55.062 --> 14:56.563
You know,
being an agent afloat,

14:56.663 --> 14:59.166
it's a, it's a great opportunity.

15:05.205 --> 15:09.209
My son plays that game.
Everybody does.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.111
Yeah.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.147
Well, I'll have to try
playing it sometime.

15:15.548 --> 15:19.286
So quick update.
We saw your mom.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.922
Can you take me to her?
Not yet.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.259
She wasn't quite ready
to talk to us.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.560
Why not?

15:27.660 --> 15:30.397
Because she doesn't know
we're the good guys yet.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.799
Which means
there are bad guys?
No.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.068
It just means she's scared.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.737
Did your mom

15:37.837 --> 15:39.672
ever talk to you
about being in trouble?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.508
No.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.943
What if you don't
find her today?

15:44.044 --> 15:46.413
Where am I supposed to sleep?

15:46.513 --> 15:49.549
Well, we called your
Family Advocacy rep.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.384
She can find you a place.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.923
I need to do my homework.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.059
Okay, yeah.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.661
Do you need a notepad
or some pens or something?

16:01.761 --> 16:04.131
No. My workbooks
are at school.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.067
Can you take me
to pick them up?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.804
Yeah.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.976
Lucy!

16:17.077 --> 16:18.945
Oh, hey!

16:19.046 --> 16:20.980
What's up?
I texted you
two hours ago

16:21.081 --> 16:22.282
about having lunch
in the park.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.017
I mean,
you never responded

16:24.117 --> 16:25.285
so I just came to see
if you were okay.
Yeah!

16:25.385 --> 16:26.653
No, lunch at the park
sounds wonderful.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.820
Let's!

16:27.920 --> 16:29.922
What's going on?

16:30.023 --> 16:31.858
Nothing.

16:32.859 --> 16:33.826
Ish.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.728
You never
ignore my texts.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.098
And you're never
this enthusiastic

16:38.198 --> 16:40.933
about outdoor activities.
Oh, I am if they
involve food.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.036
And you.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.238
I-I just haven't looked
at my phone all day.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.275
You're literally
holding it.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.478
Okay. You're right.
I've been avoiding you.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.615
I was selected for the
Special Agent Afloat position

16:55.715 --> 16:57.250
aboard an aircraft carrier.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.886
They want me to leave
for Singapore next week.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.757
Selected, like,
out of the blue?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.759
No, not exactly.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.264
I... applied last year.
After we broke up.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.401
You were so mad at me

17:14.501 --> 17:16.336
you wanted to be
as far away as you could?

17:16.436 --> 17:19.539
On a boat in the middle
of the thing you hate the most?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.874
Everything on this island
reminded me of you.

17:21.974 --> 17:26.079
I just-- I wanted to
get away.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.115
But that's not
how I feel now.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.385
So what are you gonna do?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.923
Tennant wants me
in the War Room.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.759
It's perfect timing.
I'm sorry.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.394
We're obviously
gonna discuss this.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.197
I love you and I'm not
gonna do anything

17:44.297 --> 17:46.266
without talking
to you first, okay?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.268
Okay.

17:54.741 --> 17:59.479
This is Allie Acosta,
back when she was Allison Perez.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.048
Once upon a time,
she was a financial controller

18:02.149 --> 18:03.316
at Globe Equities,

18:03.416 --> 18:06.085
a large insurance firm
in Chicago.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.289
Then, in early 2011,

18:09.389 --> 18:12.492
the FBI arrested her
for embezzlement.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.196
Nearly $20 million
stolen over five years. Yikes.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.430
According to social media,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.098
everyone in Allie's life
was shocked.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.833
She had always been
an incredibly hard worker.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.935
A buttoned-up rule follower

18:23.035 --> 18:24.537
who'd never even gotten
a traffic ticket.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.106
Then, in keeping with
the seeming shift of character,

18:27.207 --> 18:29.909
Allie skipped bail in late 2011

18:30.009 --> 18:31.944
and has been
in the wind ever since.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.214
You find any signs
she's spending the money?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.749
Because she didn't use it
on her condo.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.319
It's completely
paycheck appropriate.
Nothing so far.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.321
Theo's around 11 years old.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.657
The timeline makes me think
that Allie skipped bail

18:44.757 --> 18:46.159
because she was pregnant.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.295
Which begs the question,

18:48.395 --> 18:50.497
why would Allie leave town
without her son now?

18:50.597 --> 18:51.931
She won't.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.701
Well, good thing the kid's
secure here at Pearl.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.637
Except he's not.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.343
Hey, boss. Yeah.
Theo just grabbed his stuff.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.677
He just popped into the restroom

19:04.777 --> 19:06.613
real quick before we head...

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
Let me call you right back.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.719
Hey. Sorry.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.721
Theo?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.088
Theo, buddy, come on.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.124
Come on, we got to go.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.695
Damn it.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.277
Ouch! Watch out!

19:37.377 --> 19:39.712
Hey!
What are you doing?

20:09.376 --> 20:11.578
Why are you hiding from me?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.522
What are you doing
in the parking lot?

20:22.622 --> 20:23.790
You were supposed to be
in the bathroom.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.091
I was going to meet my mom.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.994
But when I went out
the bathroom window,

20:28.094 --> 20:30.196
two guys started
chasing me.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.832
Was one of them
this guy?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.201
No. Two other guys.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.337
All right, I-I'm here now.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.171
Let's get you back to Pearl.

20:41.441 --> 20:42.942
He's sure there were
two men chasing him?

20:43.042 --> 20:45.312
Yeah, and that neither
were Mitchell Smith.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.713
I showed Theo his photo.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.515
I wonder if they were
bounty hunters, too.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.049
Doubtful.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.451
Theo said that these goons
knocked over a kid

20:51.551 --> 20:53.152
while they were chasing him.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.787
That's a move that could lose
a bounty hunter their license.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.356
Okay. Let us know
what they say.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.825
So far, no one at the school
got a good look at 'em,

20:58.925 --> 21:00.192
but Kai's checking
with security.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.795
All right, I'll call
the Family Advocacy rep,

21:02.895 --> 21:04.397
see if they have someone
that can come tonight.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.266
Best to keep him safe at Pearl
until we ID these guys.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.937
Do we think the kidnappers are
connected to the bounty hunter?

21:11.037 --> 21:12.539
Smith said he was working alone.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.341
I buy it, as much
as I distrust him.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.275
I mean, I think if he had
other people working with him,

21:16.376 --> 21:18.177
Allie wouldn't have
gotten away so easily.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.513
You said your bounty hunter
reached out to the bondsman

21:20.613 --> 21:22.315
when he got a lead on Allie.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.917
Could be someone involved
in her original crime

21:25.017 --> 21:27.620
bribed the bondsman
to get that information?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.723
$20 million's
a lot of money.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.626
That was no easy theft
she pulled off.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.961
She might have had partners.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.262
And if she double-crossed
those partners,

21:36.363 --> 21:38.264
then they'd be
motivated to find her.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.635
Hanging out at Theo's school
might have been their only play.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.137
So what do they do next?

21:45.237 --> 21:46.606
I don't know.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.508
Knowing who they are
will help us figure that out.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.009
Lucy, go help Ernie.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.578
He's digging into the case
that got her arrested

21:51.678 --> 21:53.245
11 years ago.
Yeah, will do.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.349
Theo and his mom
have been communicating.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.151
Jesse, you think
you can talk to him?

21:59.251 --> 22:00.620
Yeah, convince him
that helping us

22:00.720 --> 22:02.321
is better
than lying to us.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.857
Please and thank you.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.527
My dad used to make
sundaes like this

22:07.627 --> 22:09.762
when I would get
into trouble.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.164
He made you sundaes
when you got into trouble?

22:12.264 --> 22:13.400
Eh, well, sort of.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.570
He'd made sundaes
and then, if I came clean,

22:17.670 --> 22:18.838
I'd get to eat it.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.941
If I didn't,
I'd have to watch him eat it.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.614
All right.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.416
Time to talk.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.784
Man-to-man.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.220
Be straight
with each other.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.022
I can go first.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.123
So...

22:37.223 --> 22:38.925
You kind of made me
look like an ass

22:39.025 --> 22:40.126
in front of my boss

22:40.226 --> 22:41.761
and you put yourself
in danger

22:41.861 --> 22:43.896
when you ran away
at the school.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.266
I know you did it because
your mom told you to.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.269
'Cause she wants
you two guys to be together.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.906
She said she has a plan.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.109
Oh, it'd better be
a really good plan

22:57.209 --> 22:58.678
because she's
in the kind of trouble

22:58.778 --> 23:00.780
that's hard to get out of
by herself.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.482
Then I'll help her.
How?

23:02.582 --> 23:06.152
You can't get to her, and
she can't get to you right now.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.521
Theo,

23:08.621 --> 23:11.691
I know you don't want anything
to happen to your mom.

23:11.791 --> 23:12.992
I don't.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.761
So you can help by telling me

23:14.861 --> 23:17.296
how you're communicating
with her.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.939
Go ahead 'cause...

23:27.039 --> 23:29.876
if I eat it, then I'm gonna
have to go for a run

23:29.976 --> 23:32.178
or something
and I don't want to do that.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.759
You've been talking
in the game chat?

23:49.529 --> 23:52.999
Okay. Bring your sundae.
Let's go talk to Tennant.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.267
ACH for major bills,

23:55.367 --> 23:58.104
credits cards
for most other expenses.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.872
The only money going
into her account

23:59.972 --> 24:01.407
are the couple's paychecks.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.675
If she stole
$20 million,

24:02.775 --> 24:04.511
she's doing a really
good job of hiding it.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.012
Yeah.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.615
Just like you did with this
agent afloat assignment.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.150
I wasn't hiding it.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.585
You just didn't tell anybody.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.420
When I applied,
I knew you all would tell me

24:14.521 --> 24:17.023
I was being reactive
to my breakup with Whistler.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.958
And then I didn't get picked,
so what did it matter?

24:19.058 --> 24:20.459
Now you got it.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.763
How do you feel?

24:23.863 --> 24:27.466
Obviously,
the timing's painful.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.336
But being

24:30.436 --> 24:34.006
the sole NCIS agent
on an aircraft carrier?

24:34.106 --> 24:36.809
All that power
and responsibility?

24:36.909 --> 24:38.645
All that fear of
falling overboard.

24:38.745 --> 24:40.547
I'd get over that,
wouldn't I?

24:42.114 --> 24:45.217
I can't tell if that laugh
is good or bad.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.454
Come on. You got to have
some advice for me.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.989
Yes. When you got together
with Whistler,

24:50.089 --> 24:51.524
you should have pulled
your application.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.025
You know,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.161
time travel is your solution
to a lot of things.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.929
It's my way of saying
it's an unsolvable problem

24:57.029 --> 24:58.464
without actually having
to say that.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.001
What about the original
investigation?

25:02.869 --> 25:05.037
Wow, nice topic bust.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.673
She was accused
of siphoning money

25:06.773 --> 25:08.808
out of small business
insurance settlements

25:08.908 --> 25:10.076
with the imbalances
getting lost

25:10.176 --> 25:11.878
in some reconciliation accounts.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.213
Where'd she siphon
the money to?
Investigators never found it.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.148
So, settlements,
that's payables.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.250
Imbalances, that's accounting.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.886
Reconciliations,
that's auditors.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.754
I feel like I'm in that
home economics class

25:21.854 --> 25:23.723
balancing my checkbook
all over again.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.857
You took home ec?

25:24.957 --> 25:26.693
I loved home ec.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.127
What's your point?

25:28.227 --> 25:29.228
Hmm.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.497
So, Tennant has a hunch

25:31.598 --> 25:32.932
that Allie wasn't
working alone.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.533
She was a low-level
controller,

25:34.634 --> 25:36.936
and when Globe Equities
went bankrupt,

25:37.036 --> 25:39.205
these three guys
started a new company

25:39.305 --> 25:41.040
with the same business model.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.709
I'm not following.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.411
How is three executives starting
a new company a red flag?

25:45.511 --> 25:48.180
Because the new company
went bankrupt two years ago

25:48.280 --> 25:50.049
after $8 million disappeared

25:50.149 --> 25:51.618
into tax shelters
and bad investments.

25:51.718 --> 25:54.053
Okay, I'm seeing
the flag now.
Mm-hmm.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.988
These three guys
may have continued

25:56.088 --> 25:57.757
stealing money
under a new banner,

25:57.857 --> 25:59.959
which means they may have been
Allie's accomplices

26:00.059 --> 26:02.762
at Globe Equities 11 years ago?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.463
It's possible.

26:05.464 --> 26:07.166
Do you think my relationship
with Whistler

26:07.266 --> 26:10.236
will work if I take
the agent afloat job?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.772
You know me, I have
an opinion about everything.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.874
On this, though,

26:14.974 --> 26:16.909
I'm gonna take a pass.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.387
I feel like I'm getting
my mom in trouble.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.657
I understand why
you feel that way,

26:30.757 --> 26:31.924
but you're not.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.392
Okay? We're worried
about your mom

26:33.492 --> 26:35.628
and we want to
make sure she's safe.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.002
I'm gonna start
the chat now, okay?

26:43.903 --> 26:45.304
Okay.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.943
Okay.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.044
Message sent.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.245
What did you say?

26:53.345 --> 26:54.947
I introduced myself,

26:55.047 --> 26:57.717
I said that you were with us
and that you gave me permission

26:57.817 --> 27:00.019
to use your game to talk to her.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.122
Do you think she's mad
that I came to you guys?

27:03.222 --> 27:06.192
No, I think she knows
you're just worried about her.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.427
And I told her
that we were, too.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.298
Usually, she writes back
right away.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.533
Do you think the guys
who chased me found her?

27:14.633 --> 27:17.069
I've lived long enough
to know that, usually,

27:17.169 --> 27:20.272
your scariest worries
don't come true.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.844
See? She just needed
a minute to respond.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.815
She wants to know
what her favorite snack is.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.216
Ah, your mom's smart.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.751
She wants to make sure
we have you

27:31.851 --> 27:33.352
and not just your device.

27:34.821 --> 27:35.922
Pickles.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.024
I love pickles.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.162
What kind?

27:43.262 --> 27:45.197
The hamburger slice ones.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.635
What did she say?

27:49.736 --> 27:51.603
She said she'd meet us.

27:53.806 --> 27:58.711
And I'm supposed to tell you
that she loves you very much.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.783
Hey.

28:04.851 --> 28:05.985
Jesse,

28:06.085 --> 28:08.087
can you take Theo
to the kitchen

28:08.187 --> 28:09.722
with his
half-melted sundae?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.523
Will do.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.326
Hey.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.929
School cops saw two guys sitting
in a car outside the school.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.330
They wrote down
the plate number.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.466
You get anything from it?
It's another rental.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.468
They didn't use
their real names.

28:22.568 --> 28:24.236
All right,
I'll fill Whistler in.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.939
You and Jesse should go
meet her at Kalakaua Avenue

28:27.039 --> 28:27.974
and pick Allie up.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.042
I'll drop the pin. Okay.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.111
Hey, Kai...

28:33.045 --> 28:34.413
She claims she's innocent

28:34.513 --> 28:37.216
and says she has
documentation to prove it.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.951
Make sure we get it.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.586
Okay.

28:44.690 --> 28:48.828
So, Whistler, how are you
feeling about everything?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.997
I'm not sure.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.032
Aren't you Mr. Sensitive
all of a sudden?

28:53.132 --> 28:54.600
Well, it's a big deal,

28:54.700 --> 28:57.236
Lucy thinking about taking
an agent afloat position.

28:58.670 --> 28:59.872
What?

28:59.972 --> 29:01.340
What?
You didn't know?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.308
No.

29:02.408 --> 29:03.943
But that doesn't matter.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.512
What matters is how you feel.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.580
Still not sure.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.384
Hey, is that our
bounty hunter?

29:13.853 --> 29:15.721
He must have followed us here.
Whistler, go find Allie.

29:15.822 --> 29:18.490
Kai, you and I,
let's go slam this guy.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.045
Guys, Allie's got a new tail.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.813
Stop! Federal agents!

29:40.913 --> 29:42.815
Copy. Stay with him.

29:46.652 --> 29:47.820
Stop! Let me go!

29:47.920 --> 29:49.188
Get in!

29:49.989 --> 29:51.157
No!

29:56.728 --> 29:58.130
Go!

29:59.365 --> 30:00.366
Hey.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.568
Are you okay?

30:03.735 --> 30:05.537
Not really.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.147
I have no idea
who those guys were.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.515
How'd they know
we'd be here?
No clue.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.550
You're the cops.
That's your job.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.886
Okay, you understand that agents

30:19.986 --> 30:21.553
of two different
federal agencies

30:21.653 --> 30:22.821
are asking you questions?

30:22.922 --> 30:24.323
That if we put
our heads together,

30:24.423 --> 30:25.858
we could find a way
to put you in federal prison

30:25.958 --> 30:28.127
just for that dumb look
on your face?

30:30.029 --> 30:31.263
I was waiting
outside the gate

30:31.363 --> 30:33.199
at Pearl Harbor
and followed you.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.334
Did they follow you?
Not that I saw.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.169
And I was checking
'cause I wanted to make sure

30:37.269 --> 30:39.638
that you folks weren't
following <i>me</i> following you.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.541
You said you got
close to her once.

30:42.641 --> 30:43.675
Where was that?

30:43.775 --> 30:44.944
Cleveland.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.412
She was living in some
dumpy apartment,

30:46.512 --> 30:47.846
working as a bookkeeper

30:47.947 --> 30:49.848
on some mom and pop
dry-cleaning operation.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.383
When you almost caught her,

30:51.483 --> 30:53.352
did you think someone else
was trying to find her?

30:53.452 --> 30:54.853
No.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.322
Hey.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.857
HPD found the car empty
less than a mile away.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.726
Got them doing
a search of the area.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.528
Hey, can you take
these cuffs off me?

31:02.628 --> 31:03.695
Not until you've been booked.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.597
For what?

31:05.697 --> 31:06.865
U.S. Code Chapter 73.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.767
Obstruction of Justice.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.870
Allie told Tennant
that she was innocent.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.539
That she had
the documentation to prove it.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.641
And now that some hired guns
just kidnapped her,

31:15.741 --> 31:17.176
I'm thinking
she's telling the truth.

31:17.276 --> 31:18.945
The guys who grabbed her
are probably working

31:19.045 --> 31:21.280
for whoever really
embezzled that money.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.748
They want her proof.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.850
They don't seem nearly as stupid
as that bounty hunter.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.219
Ernie needs to figure out how
those thugs knew where we were.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.720
And fast.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.727
Did you get her?

31:37.329 --> 31:38.730
Where is she?

31:38.830 --> 31:40.933
Look, Theo, we weren't
able to get...
Where's my mom?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.969
We're still working on it.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.004
You're supposed to
make sure she's safe.

31:45.104 --> 31:47.039
I know, bud.
We're trying.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.142
No, you're not.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.078
Hey, hey,
where are you going?
To find my mom.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.280
She's in trouble.
We're doing everything
we can, Theo.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.481
You're not!

31:59.018 --> 32:00.586
You need to stay
in the conference room.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.288
All right?
If I have to watch you,

32:02.388 --> 32:04.723
that's one less person
looking for your mom.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.766
There was
a tracking device

32:14.866 --> 32:16.535
on the bounty hunter's
second rental car.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.971
That doesn't help us much,
since we have the bounty hunter

32:19.071 --> 32:20.706
in custody and don't
need to find him.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.308
True,
but I'm betting

32:22.408 --> 32:24.010
that the tracker belonged
to the guys that grabbed Allie.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.912
And this particular tracker
connects to a phone app.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.981
You think they'd be dumb
enough to leave it running?

32:29.081 --> 32:31.917
I am counting on the general
forgetfulness of people

32:32.018 --> 32:33.785
where technology is concerned.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.755
Yes!

32:36.855 --> 32:38.890
They left the tracking
app connected?
They did.

32:38.991 --> 32:41.360
Now where are they?

32:42.461 --> 32:43.495
Got 'em.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.964
They're at Allie
and Theo's apartment.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.300
That must be where she left
her proof of innocence.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.870
Call Jesse. Tell him
I'm on my way upstairs.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.481
If both of the thugs
are in her apartment,

33:02.581 --> 33:04.550
how are we going to
get her out safely?

33:04.650 --> 33:05.751
It's a good question.

33:05.851 --> 33:06.885
Why don't you go
around back, Luce,

33:06.985 --> 33:08.254
in case they get past us.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.357
Let's go see
the building manager.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.958
That's your plan?

33:13.059 --> 33:14.793
Ask the building manager
to talk to 'em?

33:14.893 --> 33:17.529
If that would work?
Then, yes.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.070
Apartment next to Allie's.
You think this is a good idea?

33:24.170 --> 33:26.572
Not really,
but you have a better one?

33:26.672 --> 33:27.973
No.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.909
All right. On the six.
On the six.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.480
I'll see you
in 30 seconds.
I hope so.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.270
Okay, thanks.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.939
So, agent afloat?

34:36.508 --> 34:40.146
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.881
You were bonding
with the kid,

34:42.981 --> 34:45.317
and I didn't want to mess
with your head.

34:45.417 --> 34:46.618
You wouldn't have.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.587
Because you don't
care if I go?
No.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.222
Because you'll only
be gone a few months,

34:50.322 --> 34:52.258
and the photos of you
green around the gills

34:52.358 --> 34:53.959
will be
totally worth it.

34:55.294 --> 34:58.797
So... I should do it?

35:00.599 --> 35:01.900
What's your reason not to?

35:02.000 --> 35:03.902
Whistler.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.804
She's solid.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.539
If you've got reasons,

35:07.639 --> 35:09.441
they're yours, not hers.

35:15.046 --> 35:19.318
If I go, who's gonna pick
glass shards out of your hair?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.520
I'll just leave them in there
until you get back.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.829
Once I figured out
what they were doing,

35:30.929 --> 35:32.063
I started downloading
the reconciliations

35:32.164 --> 35:34.966
at the end of every day.
For proof.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.403
Did you ever contact
the authorities?

35:37.503 --> 35:38.570
No.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.005
It took me several months

35:40.105 --> 35:42.007
to be sure that they were
actually embezzling money.

35:42.107 --> 35:45.043
And, once I was...
You were pregnant.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.812
Yeah.

35:46.912 --> 35:49.415
I guess I got
scared and sloppy.

35:49.515 --> 35:53.118
I left a trail in the system
showing I'd been copying files.

35:53.219 --> 35:56.021
That's probably when
they decided to pin it on me.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.024
I don't have
any family, I...

35:59.124 --> 36:00.892
I-I just couldn't take
a chance on my baby

36:00.992 --> 36:03.662
being put up for foster care
for something I didn't do.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.497
Do you still have the proof?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.499
I think so.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.201
They watched me
deleting the files

36:09.301 --> 36:10.802
on my laptop,

36:10.902 --> 36:13.605
but they were smart enough
to know I had cloud storage.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.041
This was a virus to wipe it out,

36:16.141 --> 36:19.745
but you guys jumped in
before it did.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.984
You're gonna need to
testify against them.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.420
I know.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.291
And if I have to go to jail,

36:32.391 --> 36:34.860
Theo's got his stepdad.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.697
He'll be okay.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.666
Hopefully it doesn't
come to that.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.970
Come in.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.581
Jesse.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.249
Yeah.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.139
Hey.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.653
How are you doing?

37:36.154 --> 37:39.057
I'm not good
with big decisions.

37:39.157 --> 37:42.594
They sort of make me
sick to my stomach.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.430
Hey, well,

37:44.530 --> 37:48.567
whatever you decide,
my sweet...

37:48.667 --> 37:50.836
it's not forever.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.275
It just feels,

37:57.376 --> 37:59.044
I don't know,

37:59.144 --> 38:01.246
fraught.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.081
How come?

38:03.181 --> 38:07.786
Well, when, um...

38:07.886 --> 38:10.856
When I was in high school,
my first girlfriend

38:10.956 --> 38:12.624
and I...
What was her name?

38:12.724 --> 38:13.759
Marcella.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.727
Was she cute?
Very.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.062
Are you gonna let
me tell my story?

38:17.162 --> 38:19.798
Yes.
Are you jealous?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.333
No.
Yes, you are.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.806
Anyway, Marcella
and I would sit on this

38:27.906 --> 38:30.776
small hill because there were
no real high places to sit

38:30.876 --> 38:32.177
in our part of the world,

38:32.277 --> 38:33.612
and...

38:33.712 --> 38:36.482
she'd talk about all the
adventures we were going to have

38:36.582 --> 38:38.684
after we left Texas.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.289
Only, I-I didn't want
to have adventures.

38:44.390 --> 38:49.327
I just wanted to sit...
on the hill with Marcella.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.367
I'm not going anywhere.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.171
It's hard for me
to believe that,

39:00.271 --> 39:01.640
'cause I don't know
if you've noticed,

39:01.740 --> 39:03.041
but I have trust issues.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.610
No!

39:04.710 --> 39:06.211
Oof, best girlfriend ever.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.022
So...

39:19.525 --> 39:21.793
I think I have to do it.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.632
I have to go
on the big boat, if...

39:26.732 --> 39:29.200
you're sure
you're okay with it.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.613
Dramamine?
Jumbo sized.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.882
Wait, you knew
I was gonna go?
Yes.

39:43.982 --> 39:48.153
How?
Because I was gonna
insist upon it.

39:49.287 --> 39:50.656
I mean,

39:50.756 --> 39:52.390
you're conquering
your fears

39:52.491 --> 39:56.161
and doing something
good for you career.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.463
And...

39:58.830 --> 40:00.899
And what?

40:01.767 --> 40:05.236
We are strong enough to survive
four months of your misery.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.379
I'm gonna be
so miserable, aren't I?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.915
Oh, that big boat is
just floating out there,

40:17.015 --> 40:19.050
waiting to torture you.

40:19.150 --> 40:20.886
