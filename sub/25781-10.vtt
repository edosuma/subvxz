01:14.449 --> 01:16.493
How are you feeling, Shiro?

01:18.078 --> 01:18.912
Good.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.580
I'm good.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.957
I'm happy to tell you

01:23.041 --> 01:25.543
we've successfully attached
your new prosthetic arm.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.506
We just need to power it on
and make any final adjustments.

01:34.052 --> 01:37.597
We've outfitted it with the most powerful
energy source Earth has to offer.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.726
It's the closest we could get
to mimicking a Balmera crystal's energy.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.562
It should generate enough power
to operate most of it.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.564
The remaining power will be drawn

01:46.648 --> 01:48.775
from your body's
own electromagnetic field.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.420
He's crashing!
We have to shut it down!

02:24.811 --> 02:27.647
Sam, we need to remove the power source.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.180
What-- What happened?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.267
I feel strange.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.687
I feel great.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.069
We've learned so much
from Sendak's memories.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.072
We discovered his methods
for taking over planets like Earth.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.993
Sendak constructs armaments
at key strategic points around planets.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.663
This gives him the ability
to control enormous swaths of territory.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.334
He uses the armaments as deterrents
to prevent any uprisings

03:29.417 --> 03:31.419
and to control the conquered population.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.172
Based on data
from Commander Holt's micro-satellites,

03:34.255 --> 03:36.299
cross-referenced with resistance intel,

03:36.382 --> 03:40.011
we've ascertained that Sendak
built six massive structures on Earth.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.348
We never knew what they were
being used for until now.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.933
They're the weapons?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.060
So, what's stopping us
from blowing them up?

03:47.143 --> 03:49.896
We simply don't have enough firepower
to do the job.

03:49.979 --> 03:53.900
And even if we did, there's a good chance
those facilities contain civilians.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.401
We can't just go in blind.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.403
Admiral Sanda's right.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.615
That's why we should infiltrate a base
and gather intelligence first.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.576
The nearest base is 52 klicks
south of our position.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.245
What's the terrain like?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.580
The region around
what we'll call "Base One"

04:07.664 --> 04:09.666
is a complex urban environment.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.252
Our route will take us
through highly patrolled areas.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.796
It'll be hard to keep proper surveillance
of our surroundings

04:14.879 --> 04:16.505
due to all the structural damage.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.134
Then I suggest we form two teams:

04:20.218 --> 04:22.428
a ground unit
that will attempt to infiltrate Base One

04:22.512 --> 04:24.222
and get eyes on whatever's inside,

04:24.305 --> 04:26.808
and a sniper team that observes
from a higher position,

04:26.891 --> 04:29.477
covering the ground unit
and providing some visibility.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.771
Use communications sparingly.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.106
Stay on the move.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.858
Keep an eye on the timing patterns
of the patrol drones.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.862
Pidge, Keith, Allura, and Griffin,
you're the ground unit.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.157
Hunk, Kinkade, Lance, and I
will be sniper support.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.994
You know,
a map would've been just fine.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.454
You didn't need to come along
on this mission.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.956
What are you talking about?

04:50.039 --> 04:52.208
I've been going on these missions
for months now.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.252
No one knows the terrain better than me.

04:54.335 --> 04:57.255
Yeah, I just don't like to see you
put yourself in danger.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.425
First of all, that's very sweet,
but knock it off.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.553
You're an idiot if you think
I'm not going to defend our home.

05:04.262 --> 05:08.182
So, you excited about this mission?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.145
Yeah. Totally. I feel the same.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.951
No transmissions.
Varied radiation signatures.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.621
Approaching target location.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.750
Copy that, ground unit.
We've got eyes on you.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.645
Drone patrol ahead.

06:28.262 --> 06:30.223
This is as close
as we're gonna get.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.225
Pidge and I are going in.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.644
Negative. Route's obstructed.
It's too well guarded.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.772
Lance, you ready to cover us
when we get inside?

06:38.356 --> 06:39.273
Ready to go.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.112
It's a cosmic wolf.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.323
I've got to get me one of those.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.498
We need to find a port
where I can hack in.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.375
A control panel or substation.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.501
Got it.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.798
Got you, Keith.
Scanning for hostiles.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.884
Sentries on the other side
of the east wall.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.434
Lance?

07:15.601 --> 07:16.644
You're clear.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.064
You guys are gonna have to take
the right tunnel.

07:20.148 --> 07:20.982
But wait.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.693
There are sentries approaching
from both tunnels.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.694
Hold position.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.158
Coming up to you in three, two, one.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.754
That thing pick up
heat signatures?

07:43.838 --> 07:45.965
It actually locks on to their suits'
sonar imaging

07:46.048 --> 07:48.426
and renders a 3-D map
within a 20-foot perimeter.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.219
It's cool Paladin stuff.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.930
Got movement to the north.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.058
Drones closing in on your positions
from the adjacent alley.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.654
- We've been spotted.
- Hang tight.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.412
I think you guys made them angry.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.372
I've got five hostiles.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.875
-I'll take the three on the right.
-I got the other two.

08:34.429 --> 08:35.264
Thanks.

08:35.847 --> 08:36.682
No problem.

08:37.099 --> 08:37.933
She's pretty.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.852
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.145
Lance, Kinkade!

08:42.230 --> 08:44.148
More sentries incoming.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.232
I'm in.
Downloading intel.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.862
What is this?

09:36.742 --> 09:39.120
-It's a Zaiforge cannon.
-What?

09:39.870 --> 09:41.789
Each base must be building one.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.901
Cover is definitely blown, guys!

10:11.068 --> 10:14.113
-Keith, Pidge, it's time to roll!
-Copy that.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.448
Veronica, detonate the chaff.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.632
Rendezvous at your cruisers.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.718
We only have a couple of minutes
until the sentries gain vision again.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.221
Let's move out.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.689
Sendak has built Zaiforge cannons.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.359
Our intel indicates the cannons
were just completed.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.152
They could launch at any time.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.988
What exactly
is a Zaiforge cannon?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.531
Planet killers.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.201
If these cannons launch
and are fully charged,

11:00.284 --> 11:02.703
Sendak will be able to destroy
Earth in seconds.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.288
So, what do we do?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.667
Ideally, we attack all six bases at once,

11:07.750 --> 11:10.002
allowing them no time
to stage a counterattack.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.712
That's not possible.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.298
If we had our Lions, it could be.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.050
We'll have to find another way
to retrieve them

11:16.133 --> 11:17.676
since the ship we rode in on crashed.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.929
Your Lions
are orbiting another planet.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.889
There's no way to get you to them.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.724
Plus there are only five Lions.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.852
The MFEs would need to attack
the sixth cannon.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.313
We'd love to,
but they don't have that kind of range.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.482
There should be enough faunatonium

11:31.565 --> 11:34.402
to boost the MFEs
to the sixth base and back.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.946
That's great and all,
but Admiral Sanda has a point.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.572
We can't get to our Lions.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.249
You don't need to go to them.
They'll come to you.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.877
As Paladins of Voltron,
you can connect with your Lions.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.379
They will come.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.840
-From Saturn?
-From anywhere.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.051
You've been training for this
since the very beginning.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.679
Each of you has forged a bond
with your Lion.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.556
Tap into it.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.101
Our Lions did come to us
when we were lost in space.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.020
And Red saved my life numerous times.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.898
Yes, it's possible.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.526
So we'll call the Lions to meet us here.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.486
We'll need the element of surprise.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.448
The Lions will have to rendezvous
with us at the bases.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.325
Yeah, that will really catch
the Galra off guard.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.369
I mean, assuming our Lions
respond to our calls.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.537
What if they don't come?

12:27.371 --> 12:28.247
They'll come.

12:28.456 --> 12:32.960
And when they do, you will strike
and destroy all six cannons simultaneously

12:33.043 --> 12:34.503
before they can be launched.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.714
And when the job's done,
you can form Voltron

12:36.797 --> 12:39.216
and finish off Sendak
and the rest of his forces.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.802
My pilots can transport four of you
to the Galra bases

12:41.886 --> 12:43.596
before heading out to the sixth cannon.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.556
I'll bring Lance to Base One.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.391
It's the closest,
so I can do it by ground.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.018
It's settled, then.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.936
While Veronica drops Lance at Base One,

12:51.020 --> 12:53.731
the MFEs will each fly a Paladin
out to a base.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.776
The Paladins should reach the drop zones
at exactly the same time the Lions arrive.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.488
Then the MFEs will head
to the sixth base.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.950
We'll launch a coordinated attack
on all six locations at once.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.624
- Lance.
- Huh?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.877
I, uh-- I just wanted to say...

13:21.425 --> 13:25.387
I wanted to say... stay safe out there.

13:29.683 --> 13:30.768
You, too, Allura.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.400
Looks like the princess likes you back.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.318
What?!

13:39.610 --> 13:40.569
That's crazy!

13:40.653 --> 13:43.572
She just cares about everyone
because she's awesome like that.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.896
Paladins, our window of opportunity
is razor thin.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.191
With the element of surprise,
we'll have the advantage.

14:21.110 --> 14:21.986
Good luck.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.663
We've been spotted!

15:57.623 --> 15:59.124
Watch out, okay. Be careful!

15:59.541 --> 16:00.501
I know!

16:17.768 --> 16:19.728
Huh?

16:56.765 --> 16:59.393
Now let's see how this faunatonium works.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.400
Four of the five Paladins
have reached their drop zones.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.859
Just waiting on Lance.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.487
Lance, where are you?
Can you hear me?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.369
Whoa!

17:18.454 --> 17:19.454
Veronica, look out!

17:30.049 --> 17:30.883
Oh, no!

17:31.592 --> 17:32.426
Lance!

17:36.889 --> 17:38.515
Lance, are you there?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.642
Lance, where are you, buddy?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.102
Lance, can you hear us?

17:42.603 --> 17:45.856
Lance? Lance, come in!

18:02.206 --> 18:03.082
Veronica?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.249
Veronica!

18:07.836 --> 18:08.670
No!

18:17.429 --> 18:19.223
Veronica!

18:20.766 --> 18:21.767
Lance.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.186
Veronica, you're okay.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.905
Red Lion, checking in!

19:17.573 --> 19:20.117
We have all Lions.
It worked!

19:39.761 --> 19:41.388
Ah! I'm taking heavy fire!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.223
Something's wrong!

19:43.473 --> 19:45.392
These aren't normal base defenses!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.186
I'm pinned down!

19:47.728 --> 19:49.188
Keith, what do we do?

19:49.438 --> 19:52.774
Do what you have to.
We can't let those cannons launch!

19:53.442 --> 19:55.110
They're everywhere!

19:55.194 --> 19:56.195
-Come on!
-There's too many!

19:57.362 --> 19:58.447
-Watch out!
-I'm coming!

19:58.530 --> 20:00.449
-We need backup!
-They were ready for us.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.550
Focus on the Zaiforge cannons.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.093
Stop them from launching!

20:21.929 --> 20:23.263
Base Six is launching!

20:24.139 --> 20:26.016
I can't get near
Base One's cannon.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.561
-I can't stop the launch!
-Me neither!

20:29.770 --> 20:31.021
How did this happen?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.566
Sendak must have known
we were coming. But how?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.949
Your intel was correct after all.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.369
Prepare the cannons for launch.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.392
We were too late.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.644
The cannons have launched
and we're exposed.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.729
Sendak knows we're here with our Lions.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.064
What do we do now?

21:14.439 --> 21:17.526
- MFEs, return to the garrison.
- Roger that.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.112
Paladins, we need
to cut the head off the snake.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.197
Taking out Sendak is our last option.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.366
Everyone, converge!

21:40.507 --> 21:41.883
Align the cannons.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.567
Form Voltron!

22:02.821 --> 22:04.281
Fire Zaiforge cannons!

22:05.305 --> 22:11.231
