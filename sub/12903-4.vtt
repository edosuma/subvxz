00:54.955 --> 00:59.224
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are just moments away

00:59.226 --> 01:03.128
from hitting
our one millionth cheat.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.998
I want to thank
each and every one of you

01:06.000 --> 01:07.933
for believing
in my childhood dream...

01:07.935 --> 01:12.137
A service designed
to give a voice to a group...

01:12.139 --> 01:14.473
who for too long
have been silenced.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.642
I'm talking about people
who want to be married

01:16.644 --> 01:18.010
but still bone other people.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.178
- That's right.
- Hear, hear!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.880
That's right!
And now that dream is a reality.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.116
Cheat. Cheat.

01:24.118 --> 01:28.654
Cheat! Cheat!
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!

01:28.656 --> 01:33.425
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!
Cheat! Cheat! Cheat! Cheat!

01:35.362 --> 01:37.296
What the hell is going on?

01:41.035 --> 01:43.168
Mr. Tweedner,
the servers aren't responding.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.970
I think we've been hacked.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.246
Sorry. I think you still
have the bathroom key.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.048
Sorry.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.249
Thanks.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.362
Geils, Tribeca,

02:10.364 --> 02:13.699
I'm afraid cybercrime has
once again reared its ugly head.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.601
Lieutenant, I told you,
it's just a printer jam.

02:15.603 --> 02:20.105
Has anyone here heard of
the website "MeetNCheat.org"?

02:22.243 --> 02:23.408
Their server's been hacked.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.543
The perpetrator is threatening

02:24.545 --> 02:25.744
to release the names
and identities

02:25.746 --> 02:28.714
of all the cheaters on the site
unless it's shut down.

02:29.450 --> 02:33.452
Why do we have to help a website
that encourages people to cheat?

02:33.454 --> 02:36.288
I say let the data be published.

02:37.525 --> 02:42.327
I know it's distasteful,
Tribeca, but the law is the law.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.163
Now, because it's a cybercrime,

02:44.165 --> 02:46.465
the FBI
has sent us a tech expert

02:46.467 --> 02:47.466
to help out with the case.

02:47.468 --> 02:52.771
I'd like to introduce you
to Special Agent Diane Duran.

03:20.968 --> 03:21.633
Good morning.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.770
Agent Duran,
Detectives Treils and Gibeca.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.706
Sorry, I'm flustered
because you're so impressive.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.308
He's Treils. I'm Gibeca.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.342
Nice to meet you. Hi.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.211
Your reputation
precedes you, Duran.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.880
Smart, professional, but with
a fun, mischievous side.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.349
You flatter me, Lieutenant.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.618
Geils, I think
you lost something.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.289
We got a real tough one here,
Agent Duran.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.123
Call me Diane.

03:45.125 --> 03:49.228
Let's see if we can give this
hacker a run for his money.

03:52.499 --> 03:55.400
At 9:03 A.M., a self-replicating
code was Trojan-Horsed

03:55.402 --> 03:57.269
through the backdoor of
Meet'N'Cheat's servers.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.205
Those computer-sounding words
convince me you're an expert.

04:00.207 --> 04:01.406
Why don't I set my equipment up,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.875
and you can go talk to
the C.E.O. of Meet'N'Cheat,

04:03.877 --> 04:05.310
find out if he has any enemies?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.279
Other than every housewife
in America.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.349
Great. We'll get right on it.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.150
I want to date her.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.585
I want to <i> be</i> her.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.053
Okay.
What'd you guys come up with?

04:16.055 --> 04:17.154
Every minute I'm not online,

04:17.156 --> 04:18.890
a dad is throwing a football
with his son,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.358
a mom's helping her daughter
with homework.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.227
Couples are finding ways
to make it work,

04:22.229 --> 04:23.662
and that's money
out of my pocket.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.364
How do you live with yourself?

04:25.366 --> 04:26.365
I'll tell you how I live.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.133
I sleep on a bed
made out of human buttocks.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.635
Every item of clothing
that I'm wearing

04:29.637 --> 04:31.203
was handmade
by a gifted Asian child.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.305
You want to know what I drink
instead of water?

04:33.307 --> 04:34.373
Supermodel breast milk.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.108
You want to know
what kind of car I drive?

04:36.110 --> 04:38.210
A pre-owned Toyota Avalon.

04:38.212 --> 04:41.213
Sir, on behalf of the 99%,
thank you.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.180
You're a job creator.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.516
What I do might be distasteful
to you, Detective,

04:44.518 --> 04:47.753
but the world needs guys like me
to take us to the next level.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.821
I mean, imagine a world
without honesty,

04:49.823 --> 04:52.357
fidelity, common decency.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.425
You know what I think?

04:53.427 --> 04:56.261
I think we should let this
hacker release all your data

04:56.263 --> 04:57.629
and bring this company
tumbling down.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.798
Sounds like someone doesn't
want their parking validated.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.867
Do you have any enemies?
People who want you to fail?

05:01.869 --> 05:04.269
It would be a heck of a lot
easier to count my friends.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.239
Let's do that, then. Anyone left
over will be considered your enemy.

05:07.241 --> 05:13.045
Okay. Alex Rodriguez,
Dustin Diamond... and that's it.

05:13.881 --> 05:14.713
Wait a second.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.115
There were these twins
that I went to school with,

05:17.117 --> 05:18.550
Ned and Ted Doppelganger.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.318
Hate my guts.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.486
They think that I stole the idea
for Meet'N'Cheat from them.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.422
But that's not true?
No, it's totally true.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.324
I literally took their computer
from their home.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.726
Ski mask, flashlight,
the whole nine yards.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.393
Suckers.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.562
There's no way this guy's
friends with Dustin Diamond.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.898
And where would we find
these Doppelgangers?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.333
Well, they teach
at our old school.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.801
You know it as Harvard,
but most people know it

05:35.803 --> 05:39.371
as the Miami University of Ohio
of Massachusetts.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.270
Thank you for meeting with us,
Professor Doppelganger.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.806
And Professor Doppelganger.
Of course.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.377
Not that we're anxious to
help out our old "friend".

06:18.379 --> 06:20.712
Garth Tweedner.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.483
That prospect
is less than appetizing.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.619
I take it you're not the biggest
fan of the rock star C.E.O.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.755
who stole your idea
and made millions from it.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.556
Since the gag order,
we're not allowed to say

06:31.558 --> 06:33.759
what we really think
about Mr. Tweedner.

06:33.761 --> 06:34.693
But off the record?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.795
I think he's
the scum of the Earth.

06:36.797 --> 06:37.829
Lowest of the low.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.331
Sounds like a pretty big grudge.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.768
Big enough to want to take down
his whole operation.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.504
Hacking's not our game,
Detective.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.473
When we take people on,
they know about it.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.410
Besides, we're about to start
a new business venture.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.611
It's called FastFruit.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.479
It's gonna revolutionize
fruit delivery.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.014
You suddenly got a hankering
for a plum?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.983
Within five minutes,
a drone arrives

06:57.985 --> 06:59.584
and drops it right in your hand.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.387
Allow us to demonstrate.
Name any fruit.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.356
Tomato. You're that guy?

07:04.358 --> 07:08.193
Ted, it's fine.
Hand me the drone controls.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.395
As we speak,
I'm piloting a drone

07:10.397 --> 07:12.831
to our fruit-distribution
warehouse in New Hampshire.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.499
Is there anything about
the nature of the hack

07:14.501 --> 07:15.901
that would point to
who might have done it?

07:15.903 --> 07:19.004
Now, I've selected your tomato
from a huge pile of tomatoes,

07:19.006 --> 07:20.872
and I'm piloting it
back to this room.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.008
Hackers all have
their own signatures.

07:23.010 --> 07:23.942
They're show-offs.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.343
They don't want to get caught,

07:25.345 --> 07:27.546
but they certainly
want the recognition.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.514
Holy shit! Look out!

07:35.689 --> 07:36.655
Your tomato.

07:36.657 --> 07:40.625
We're still taking investors
at the $10,000 price point.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.629
So, we've come up empty so far.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.697
Any new leads you can give us?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.899
I have an algorithm running
that should ping the location

07:47.901 --> 07:49.468
of the servers
connected to the hack.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.936
And I'm making
linguini alle vongole,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.437
but help yourself to charcuterie

07:52.439 --> 07:54.539
if you need something
right away.

07:55.609 --> 07:59.744
That should be the location
of the server.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.486
We've been hacked.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.392
My mom had blowy hair.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.498
We don't know much, Mr. Mayor.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.532
The hacker is threatening

08:20.534 --> 08:23.235
to release the names
of every user on the site

08:23.237 --> 08:24.569
unless we shut it down
permanently.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.239
And now he's inside
the LAPD's network.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.206
And if he can get in here,

08:28.208 --> 08:30.075
there's no telling
what he's capable of.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.544
There's only one way of
dealing with this, Pritikin.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.879
Succumb to his every demand.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.246
Pardon me? Shut down the site.
Pay him off.

08:35.249 --> 08:38.450
Make this thing go away. I'm not
sure that'll be the end of it.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.452
There are 25
government employees

08:40.453 --> 08:43.855
in nine different county
departments on Meet'N'Cheat,

08:43.857 --> 08:45.891
including one
in the mayor's office.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.559
Sir, we cannot just
give into this guy.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.261
Damn it, Atkins,
inside the mayor's office.

08:49.263 --> 08:52.597
Not the outer office. The <i> inner</i> office.
Where the mayor sits.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.166
Sir, I understand there is sensitive
info that we are dealing with...

08:55.168 --> 08:57.869
The guy on this list
sits in the mayor's chair.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.537
Wears the mayor's suits.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.072
Has a plaque on his desk
that says "Mayor Perry."

09:01.074 --> 09:03.008
Look, people are gonna
get swept up in this...

09:03.010 --> 09:05.410
My name is on the list.
Mayor Joe Perry.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.112
Username... MayorJoePerry1.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.513
Password...
"YesThatMayorJoePerry."

09:08.515 --> 09:11.650
Sir, the only way we are gonna figure
out whose names are on that list

09:11.652 --> 09:13.018
is to figure out
who the hacker is.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.987
Now, I am asking for your
permission to divert resources...

09:15.989 --> 09:18.056
Me, the man
standing in front of you,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.325
the mayor of Los Angeles,
cheats on his wife

09:20.327 --> 09:22.360
and does so
by making use of a website

09:22.362 --> 09:24.429
exclusively designed
for cheaters.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.363
MeetNCheat.org.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.464
Mr. Mayor,
if I didn't know better,

09:26.466 --> 09:27.966
I'd think you're trying
to cover up the fact

09:27.968 --> 09:32.237
that your name may have
somehow ended up on that list.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.408
So, who's this guy again?

09:36.410 --> 09:40.278
Just a homie I used to roll with
back in my math club days.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.248
But I got to warn you,
he ain't too good with people.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.251
I don't know about this.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.419
What the do you want?!

09:47.421 --> 09:51.323
Ced, it's me, Tanner,
from the old neighborhood.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.026
Who this vanilla yogurt?

09:55.028 --> 09:58.930
Detective Jay Geils,
meet Cedric the Programmer.

10:00.968 --> 10:04.002
So, you talk to anybody
from the old crew?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.004
You hear about Bernie Macbook?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.305
Nah. Yeah, man.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.506
Yahoo got him.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.444
Now he creating digital
platforms for branded content.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.145
Damn.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.415
So, what we're
interested in... Whoa!

10:17.417 --> 10:19.384
Man, who brought
this side of steamed rice?!

10:19.386 --> 10:21.620
Detective Geils,
meet Cedric the Programmer.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.255
A grandfather clock fell
on his head back in the day.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.557
He doesn't remember things
too well.

10:25.559 --> 10:28.159
But he's so sharp
in many other ways.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.162
So, you must be in
a hell of a lot of trouble

10:31.164 --> 10:32.364
for you to call on Cedric.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.399
Well, the fact is,
we're... Whoa!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.701
Man, who brought this slice
of Monterey Jack?!

10:36.703 --> 10:39.304
Detective Geils,
meet Cedric the Programmer.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.172
Why don't you
let me do the talking?

10:41.174 --> 10:43.441
So, I don't know if you're aware
of this, but...

10:43.443 --> 10:44.676
The Meet'N'Cheat hack.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.078
Yeah, man, that was some
straight-up backdoor

10:47.080 --> 10:52.317
port 3127 forward slash TCP shit
right there, man!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.019
So you know the hacker?
Whoa, man!

10:54.021 --> 10:56.721
Man, who brought this roll of
Brawny paper towel up in here?!

10:56.723 --> 10:59.391
Detective Geils,
meet Cedric the Programmer.

10:59.393 --> 11:02.861
Can you not talk
for like 30 seconds?

11:08.335 --> 11:08.967
Yeah.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.169
Yeah, you got a hacker
named the Mailer Demon

11:11.171 --> 11:12.570
interested in y'all.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.972
And this one bad mofo.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.175
I'm talking arms trading,
government-server breaches,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.945
global destabilization,
mean Facebook comments.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.113
We want to meet him.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.448
The Demon don't meet nobody

11:23.450 --> 11:25.583
unless a couple of milli
on the table.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.685
Can you get in touch with him?

11:26.687 --> 11:30.121
What you want me to do?
Send him an AOL instant message?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.123
Could you? Sure.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.968
Geils in position.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.340
Tanner and Hoffman in position.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.608
Tribeca in position.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.645
No sign of the Demon.
He's 10 minutes late.

11:53.647 --> 11:54.813
I don't like this.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.415
Hang on. Someone's coming.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.419
I got him.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.389
No, wait a second.
I got him right here.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.992
He's here.
I see him very clearly.

12:08.361 --> 12:11.162
Freeze! LAPD! Hands up!

12:11.732 --> 12:14.265
Wait a second. That can't be.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.040
He made us.
There's a bunch of them.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.428
Hey!

12:56.343 --> 12:57.343
Freeze!

13:10.223 --> 13:13.158
Noooo!

13:24.470 --> 13:25.703
All right. What have we got?

13:25.705 --> 13:28.406
We know that Diane Duran
is in on whatever this is,

13:28.408 --> 13:29.240
and she's FBI...

13:29.242 --> 13:31.309
Which means anybody
could be in on it,

13:31.311 --> 13:32.143
even one of us.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.279
I think it's time to initiate
Bravo Two Protocol.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.648
From now on, only the four of us
in this room

13:36.650 --> 13:37.715
are pursuing this case.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.217
We don't talk to
any outside agencies,

13:39.219 --> 13:42.654
any government offices,
baristas, or hairdressers,

13:42.656 --> 13:44.823
and that includes social media.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.259
Find out who Diane Duran
really is

13:48.261 --> 13:50.762
and who she's working for
by any means available.

13:50.764 --> 13:55.166
But keep in mind, this is all
being funded by our tax dollars.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.419
Digital implant activated.

14:15.388 --> 14:19.123
Copy that, Tribeca.
I am seeing what you're seeing.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.826
And I can tell when
you're rolling your eyes.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.394
It's just a little frustrating

14:23.396 --> 14:25.563
when we're doing
Bravo Two Protocol

14:25.565 --> 14:27.632
and Geils tells his girlfriend.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.600
You gonna cry about it?

14:28.602 --> 14:30.168
No, I'm not gonna cry about it.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.371
You just have to tell me, 'cause
it could wash out the lens.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.339
Geils, check in.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.506
I'm trying to get in position,

14:35.508 --> 14:38.142
but these suction cups
might be too powerful.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.750
Tanner? Sorry I'm
moving kind of slowly.

14:45.752 --> 14:49.988
There was a mix-up in the
undercover-costume department.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.626
Next stop, Miracle Mile...

14:57.297 --> 14:59.330
I've got eyes on Duran.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.473
Okay, she's headed
into a building.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.376
4253 Wilshire Boulevard.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.443
Checking.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.545
Building's owned
by a corporation

15:14.547 --> 15:15.446
called Mayhem Global.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.181
Mayhem Global?
What do we know about them?

15:17.183 --> 15:18.850
They got their hands
in a little bit of everything...

15:18.852 --> 15:21.819
Construction, import/export,
fracking, real estate,

15:21.821 --> 15:22.921
party supplies, t-shirts,

15:22.923 --> 15:25.223
culturally-insensitive
Halloween costumes,

15:25.225 --> 15:26.557
and all the healthcare
in Louisiana.

15:26.559 --> 15:30.595
So, Mayhem Global hires Duran
to hack Meet'N'Cheat.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.796
She draws us in.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.631
Then she hacks us
from the inside.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.834
But why?
Who the hell are these people?

15:36.836 --> 15:39.604
What are they up to?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.043
Package for Mayhem Global.

15:45.045 --> 15:48.279
Why are you dressed
as an astronaut?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.815
Sign here, please.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.485
Why'd you do that?

15:54.487 --> 15:59.157
Does it have to do with why
you're dressed as an astronaut?

16:08.234 --> 16:10.568
Hey, Bill.

16:19.913 --> 16:20.778
Scholls, talk to me.

16:20.780 --> 16:25.249
Okay. The server room
is on the east side, 15th floor.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.322
Looks like the guard doesn't
have clearance to go upstairs.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.957
Give me a minute.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.993
<i>Hey, guys. It's Doug.</i>

16:34.995 --> 16:36.060
<i>Welcome to episode two</i>

16:36.062 --> 16:38.696
<i>"of" How to Get Someone
to the 15th Floor.</i>

16:38.698 --> 16:40.098
<i>When You Only Have a Key Card.</i>

16:40.100 --> 16:42.300
<i>"That Gets Them
to the First Floor."</i>

16:42.302 --> 16:45.269
Okay. Hit 7-7-7-7 pound.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.775
Tribeca, don't do
anything till I get up there.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.613
I'm on 15. Where am I going?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.682
The server room
is two doors down on your right.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.450
I deactivated
the temperature sensors,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.019
the sound sensors,
and the bathroom,

17:01.021 --> 17:04.122
so you're gonna have to hold it.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.757
Take a look at the keypad.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.492
I want to see
what we're dealing with here.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.093
Looks like a fingerprint scan.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.962
Any ideas? Reach into your bag.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.830
There should be
a universal finger.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.105
I'm in.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.306
Okay. Boot up the system.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.875
Stick the flash drive
into the USB port.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.576
We'll upload our spyware
into their system

17:25.578 --> 17:28.079
so it can monitor it
from the precinct.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.653
Hang on, Tribeca.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.655
Tribeca, get out of there!
There's a red dot coming!

17:37.657 --> 17:40.725
I'm almost done. You're
almost done all right.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.628
You looking for this?

17:43.630 --> 17:46.731
Did you really think you could
take down Mayhem Global?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.865
Agent Duran, why?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.601
You're the perfect woman.
You're the perfect FBI agent.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.636
It doesn't make any sense.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.172
When you see the bigger picture,
Tribeca, it will all make sense.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.840
And you're gonna be
a big part of it.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.975
Really?
I'm gonna be a big part of it?

17:57.977 --> 17:59.577
Wait.
I don't want any part of it!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.647
But like how big of a part?
I'm so confused.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.582
Tribeca!

18:04.584 --> 18:09.720
Tribecaaaaaaa!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.558
You can't compete with me,
Tribeca.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.893
I have skills beyond
what you can even imagine...

18:15.895 --> 18:18.129
The ability to balance
workplace excellence,

18:18.131 --> 18:20.598
domestic prowess,
and effortless style.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.001
Women can have it all,
and I'm the living proof.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.003
Not for long.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.841
I call this "Brunch with Global
Conspiracy Girlfriends."

18:29.843 --> 18:33.711
It goes great with a homemade
goji-berry mojito.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.482
"Assassinating the Prime
Minister at a State Dinner."

18:37.484 --> 18:38.549
Don't forget your mini clutch

18:38.551 --> 18:42.553
for your wallet, lip gloss,
and .38 revolver.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.627
"Motorcycle Chase Couture."

18:49.629 --> 18:51.462
I need backup.
She's too much woman for me.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.698
Do you think Geils is in love with
you because you're a tough cop?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.635
No. He's in love with you
because you're a strong woman.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.803
You don't understand.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.105
She's wearing a cape
and rocking it.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.607
You are more woman, more cop,

19:02.609 --> 19:03.975
than any woman or cop
I've ever met.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.944
Now stop hiding behind that dark
suit and those blocky shoes

19:06.946 --> 19:10.047
and just show her
the woman cop you really are!

19:10.049 --> 19:12.316
Hngh!

19:13.853 --> 19:16.220
Wow. That look is perfect.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.789
It's called
the Kick-Ass Ensemble

19:18.791 --> 19:21.592
from the Taking Names
collection.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.699
<i>Upload complete.</i>

19:30.002 --> 19:31.002
I'm just activating the spyware,

19:31.004 --> 19:33.938
and then we should have a look
at what Mayhem Global is up to.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.939
Good job, Dr. Scholls.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.774
It was really Tribeca
who did all the heavy lifting.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.310
Well, if Tanner hadn't driven by
with that truck full of mattresses

19:39.312 --> 19:42.713
at just the right time, you'd be
scraping me off the sidewalk.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.149
I just had a feeling, you know?

19:45.151 --> 19:48.052
Okay, has everyone
in the scene talked?

19:48.054 --> 19:51.222
I haven't, sir.
But... now I have.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.991
And we are up and running.

19:55.295 --> 19:59.297
What's happening?

19:59.999 --> 20:03.734
They're uploading something
from our I.P. address.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.513
What the hell?

20:15.515 --> 20:19.183
This is all the stolen
data from the Meet'N'Cheat hack.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.452
Names and addresses
of all the members on the site.

20:21.454 --> 20:25.156
They're making it look like
the LAPD is publishing it.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.892
You said Agent Duran
was in jail, right?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.927
I took her there myself.
