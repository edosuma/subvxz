Gentlemen, please.
A little room for the king.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.793
Welcome to Gotham City,
Your Highness.

00:29.795 --> 00:31.461
This has been
a long awaited pleasure.

00:31.463 --> 00:35.565
Thank you, my friends. But
the pleasure is entirely mine.

00:35.567 --> 00:38.868
I've heard wonderful things
about your city.

00:38.870 --> 00:41.071
How was your flight,
Your Majesty.

00:41.073 --> 00:42.505
Bumpy.

00:42.507 --> 00:42.906
Oh, uh..

00:42.908 --> 00:45.675
Except when we crossed
into American territory

00:45.677 --> 00:47.644
then it was smooth.

00:48.847 --> 00:49.679
I'd like to ask--

00:49.681 --> 00:51.081
The limousine's waiting,
Your Majesty.

00:51.083 --> 00:54.117
I'm sure you'd like
to go to the hotel.

00:54.119 --> 00:54.884
Fine, fine.

00:54.886 --> 00:57.053
Oh, uh..
May I take that for you?

00:57.055 --> 00:57.987
No-no, no thank you.
No.

00:57.989 --> 01:00.090
No offense,
but it's too important.

01:00.092 --> 01:04.060
I shall carry it with me
until the presentation.

01:04.062 --> 01:04.894
Your Majesty..

01:04.896 --> 01:06.496
...on behalf
of the Welcoming Committee

01:06.498 --> 01:08.431
I'd like to present you
with these roses.

01:08.433 --> 01:12.102
Well, thank you, young lady.
Thank you very much.

01:12.104 --> 01:16.373
Shy little thing, isn't she?

01:16.375 --> 01:17.974
These flowers are certainly..

01:36.461 --> 01:39.496
Make anything out of it,
Chief O'Hara?

01:43.034 --> 01:45.735
There's no doubt about it..

01:45.737 --> 01:46.503
...The Riddler

01:46.505 --> 01:50.006
that infernal Prince of Puzzlers
as you call him

01:50.008 --> 01:52.008
is up to his old tricks.

01:52.010 --> 01:55.779
And what will those
tricks be, chief?

01:55.781 --> 01:58.715
"When is a person
like a piece of wood?"

01:58.717 --> 02:00.617
What does it mean?

02:00.619 --> 02:02.852
I wish I knew,
commissioner.

02:02.854 --> 02:04.053
I wish I knew.

02:04.055 --> 02:08.558
Anyone else think they can make
any sense out of it?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.728
Well, there is one man
who might be able to.

02:14.733 --> 02:17.967
I have a fine police force here,
yet I have no alternative

02:17.969 --> 02:20.069
but to call on his services
once again.

02:20.071 --> 02:24.007
Long time ago, I gave up trying
to figure out who he was

02:24.009 --> 02:25.809
I owe him too much for that.

02:25.811 --> 02:29.212
We all owe him
a very great deal.

02:31.516 --> 02:32.215
<i> And in Wayne Manor</i>

02:32.217 --> 02:35.985
<i> stately and secure home</i>
<i> of millionaire Bruce Wayne</i>

02:35.987 --> 02:39.489
<i> and his youthful ward</i>
<i> Dick Grayson.</i>

02:43.829 --> 02:47.130
I'll beckon him,
sir, immediately.

02:49.801 --> 02:54.170
You think?
That's mate...old chum.

02:56.541 --> 02:59.709
Gosh, Bruce.
Why can't I ever beat you?

02:59.711 --> 03:01.544
You have on...several occasions.

03:01.546 --> 03:03.646
Only when your mind
is on important matters..

03:03.648 --> 03:06.583
Excuse me for interrupting, sir.

03:06.585 --> 03:09.552
- But it's the Batphone.
- Oh, boy!

03:09.754 --> 03:12.689
Oops! Sorry, Aunt Harriet.
I didn't mean to scare you.

03:12.691 --> 03:15.525
Mercy alive! If I didn't know
you two better

03:15.527 --> 03:17.160
I'd think you were
up to something.

03:17.162 --> 03:18.962
What do you mean,
Aunt Harriet?

03:18.964 --> 03:20.864
Well, it's just that
every once in awhile

03:20.866 --> 03:24.167
you come zooming out
of this room like jet planes

03:24.169 --> 03:25.869
practically knocking me over

03:25.871 --> 03:29.873
and then rushing out
with hardly any explanation.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.107
There's no mystery,
Aunt Harriet.

03:31.109 --> 03:33.142
Dick and I just played
a game of chess

03:33.144 --> 03:36.713
and we agreed that if I won,
he'd do some studying.

03:36.715 --> 03:39.015
If he won,
we'd go fishing.

03:39.017 --> 03:40.783
Bye, dear.

03:46.625 --> 03:47.657
Yes, commissioner.

03:47.659 --> 03:52.028
Batman, I'm having trouble..

03:52.030 --> 03:53.630
...with a riddle.

03:53.632 --> 03:54.764

I agree. Nobody else would use
such a spectacular

05:40.739 --> 05:42.772
and bizarre method
to flaunt a puzzle.

05:42.774 --> 05:47.444
What the devil is the culprit
trying to tell us?

05:47.446 --> 05:49.479
The riddle itself
is pretty basic.

05:49.481 --> 05:53.049
A person is a piece of wood
when he's a ruler.

05:53.051 --> 05:56.119
You figure it has something
to do with King Boris.

05:56.121 --> 05:57.721
- Maybe.
- Good thinking, Robin.

05:57.723 --> 06:02.759
But no attempt was made
to abduct or to harm him.

06:02.761 --> 06:06.563
Wood, ruler, king. Tsk.

06:06.565 --> 06:07.597
A chess king.

06:07.599 --> 06:09.833
The International Chess
Tournament tonight.

06:09.835 --> 06:12.369
Twenty five thousand dollars
in prize money.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.903
Boy Wonder,
you've done it again.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.106
I think this thing
is much bigger than that.

06:16.108 --> 06:19.042
The Riddler goes after
millions not thousands.

06:19.044 --> 06:21.745
He loves to dazzle us
with his fancy footwork.

06:21.747 --> 06:25.915
In any case, assign an extra
squad of men to cover the place.

06:25.917 --> 06:29.719
- What is King Boris' itinerary?
- He's here on a goodwill visit.

06:29.721 --> 06:30.553
Among other things

06:30.555 --> 06:34.524
he's to be an honorary judge at
the Miss Galaxy finals tomorrow.

06:34.526 --> 06:35.425
And the following day

06:35.427 --> 06:37.761
will appear at the Queen
of Freedom Monument.

06:37.763 --> 06:38.895
I saw that in the papers.

06:38.897 --> 06:41.164
He's going to present
the Museum of Fame

06:41.166 --> 06:45.936
with a doll-sized replica
of the Queen of Freedom.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.605
Queen?

06:47.607 --> 06:49.673
A queen can be a ruler.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.842
- That's it.
- What queen?

06:51.844 --> 06:55.446
There is no queen,
the king ain't married.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.814
There will be tomorrow.

06:56.816 --> 06:57.782
A new queen of beauty.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.918
They're gonna crown her
with a priceless diamond

07:00.920 --> 07:02.153
and emerald tiara.

07:02.155 --> 07:02.953
Exactly, Robin.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.824
It's my guess that our puzzling
friend will try to steal it.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.058
Ah, now,
we're getting somewhere.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.628
'I'll have that place
blocked so tight..'

07:10.630 --> 07:13.130
On the contrary..

07:16.202 --> 07:22.540
...I think we should let
The Riddler steal the tiara.

07:25.711 --> 07:30.581
Ladies and gentlemen, before
I announce this year's winner

07:30.583 --> 07:35.953
I shall like to introduce you
to last year's Miss Galaxy.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.823
She is Jackie Sands.

07:47.733 --> 07:48.466
This is it.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.668
The moment you've all
been waiting for.

07:50.670 --> 07:54.738
The moment one of these girls
has been waiting for.

07:54.740 --> 07:55.773
Our moment of truth.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.641
Knowing that arch-villain
The Riddler

07:57.643 --> 08:00.711
I'm almost positive
he'll show up for this event.

08:00.713 --> 08:01.512
We'll soon find out.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.882
Miss Galaxy will be crowned
any moment.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.087
The new Miss Galaxy

08:10.089 --> 08:11.722
Queen of Beauty is..

08:11.724 --> 08:16.093
...Southern City's own
sparkling-eyed beauty

08:16.095 --> 08:17.094
Julia Davis.

08:26.973 --> 08:30.574
- Congratulations, Julia.
- Thank you.

08:30.576 --> 08:31.141
Miss Galaxy..

08:31.143 --> 08:34.678
...it is with great pleasure
that I crown you Queen of Beauty

08:34.679 --> 08:38.182
with this magnificent diamond
and emerald tiara.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.184
- Oh! Thank you.
- Isn't she beautiful?

08:41.187 --> 08:43.687
'Miss Galaxy.'

09:03.308 --> 09:06.743
He's in for quite a surprise
when he discovers I substituted

09:06.745 --> 09:08.077
a fake tiara
for the real one.

09:08.079 --> 09:10.548
Too bad we didn't get a chance
to paste The Riddler.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.349
We might yet.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.817
Don't forget I placed
a homing transmitter

09:13.819 --> 09:15.219
in the band of that tiara.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.988
It'll lead us right
to his hideout.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.123
Yes.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.192
Now, to the Batmobile.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.015
Wait, Robin. Look.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.018
Holy sewer pipe!
What's he up to?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.620
You're slipping, Batman.

09:49.622 --> 09:54.191
I knew it was a phony crown
all the time.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.661
Riddle me this, crime fighter.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.364
What room can no one enter?

10:00.366 --> 10:01.699
If you figure it out

10:01.701 --> 10:06.604
look for another royal riddle
in this crown.

10:16.382 --> 10:20.684
That ends any chance of tracking
him with the homing device.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.720
Shall we after him
in the manhole?

10:22.722 --> 10:23.754
We'll never find him.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.890
There're hundreds of tunnels
down here.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.231
A riddle a day
keeps The Riddler away.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.099
What?

10:35.101 --> 10:36.133
Once, a long time ago

10:36.135 --> 10:38.202
The Riddler made the mistake
of telling me that.

10:38.204 --> 10:41.238
It means as long as he dishes
out riddles, he's..

10:41.240 --> 10:44.375
...he's not finished
with his plot.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.376
When the riddles stop

10:45.378 --> 10:49.146
that's when he's ready
for his final caper.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.014
Then he told the truth.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.917
That diamond tiara wasn't
what he was really after.

10:53.919 --> 10:54.752
Right, Robin.

10:54.754 --> 10:58.922
But we have two more riddles
to tell us what it may be.

11:19.945 --> 11:21.679
Now. First clue was

11:21.681 --> 11:24.381
What room can no one enter?

11:24.383 --> 11:25.149
A mushroom.

11:25.151 --> 11:28.986
Agreed. Uh, the second one.
Read it again.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.824
"What is the beginning
of eternity

11:33.826 --> 11:35.159
"the end of time and space

11:35.161 --> 11:39.697
beginning of every end and
the end of every race?"

11:39.699 --> 11:40.898
Golly, Batman.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.733
It doesn't seem to make sense.

11:42.735 --> 11:47.938
Let's see. If your first answer,
a mushroom was correct..

11:49.709 --> 11:50.407
Why, that's it.

11:50.609 --> 11:53.577
- Of course.
- You have it?

11:53.579 --> 11:57.648
What was it The Riddler said
when he threw back the tiara?

11:57.650 --> 12:02.185
"There's a royal riddle
in this crown."

12:02.187 --> 12:05.923
Look up the address
of the Royal Mushroom Club.

12:06.158 --> 12:10.260
There are some things we can do
the good old-fashion way.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.695
Using the telephone book.

12:11.697 --> 12:15.032
Oh! I must be getting lazy.

12:16.301 --> 12:19.736
<i> Meanwhile, in another cave,</i>
<i> a rat cave</i>

12:19.738 --> 12:23.306
<i> dreary hideout</i>
<i> of the sinister River Rats Gang</i>

12:23.308 --> 12:26.609
<i> currently in the employ</i>
<i> of The Riddler.</i>

12:26.611 --> 12:28.745
What's this, River Rats?

12:28.747 --> 12:31.714
Munching cheese
while there's work to be done?

12:31.716 --> 12:33.249
Sorry, Riddler,
but we got hungry.

12:33.251 --> 12:35.885
Oh, indeed. Well, perhaps
you'll lose your appetite

12:35.887 --> 12:39.589
when I deduct the cheese bill
from your share of the profits.

12:39.591 --> 12:43.293
- How'd it go, chief?
- Magnificent.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.060
Sumptuous.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.263
You should have seen the look
on Batman's face

12:46.265 --> 12:50.133
when I threw the tiara.

12:50.135 --> 12:51.001
Now, my good rats.

12:51.003 --> 12:54.271
Now is the time to go
to the Royal Mushroom Club.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.740
If Plan 13-Z goes well,
and I'm sure it will

12:56.742 --> 13:02.679
the finest achievement in crime
shall be culminated tonight.

13:04.049 --> 13:07.718
The end of Batman and Robin.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.361
<i> And later,</i>
<i> at the Royal Mushroom Club..</i>

13:17.363 --> 13:18.563
Magnificent.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.198
What a fantastic duplication.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.600
Those jewels,
it must be worth a fortune.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.402
Value was not the object.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.703
It's friendship that counts

13:25.705 --> 13:30.675
and admiration
for your great country.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.643
To America!

13:32.645 --> 13:35.279
America.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.949
'Mmm! What a delicious wine.'

13:37.951 --> 13:39.250
Ho ho. Marvelous bouquet.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.286
The Royal Mushroom Club has
some of the finest wines

13:42.288 --> 13:44.422
in the world. Right,
Mr. Ambassador.

13:44.424 --> 13:48.259
Yes. Fine vintages
and rare years indeed.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.795
Begging your pardon,
Mr. Ambassador

13:50.797 --> 13:53.898
but we're every proud
of our wine cellar.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.834
Perhaps His Majesty
would like a tour?

13:56.836 --> 13:57.835
An excellent idea.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.238
I'm always interested
in good wines.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.974
Like a small boy looking
at expensive bicycles.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.876
Well then,
let me lead the way.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.259
Batman! Robin!

14:21.561 --> 14:24.729
- Trouble or pleasure?
- We're not sure yet.

14:24.731 --> 14:25.863
Is King Boris
visiting here tonight?

14:25.865 --> 14:29.567
Why, yes. He just went for
a tour of our wine cellar.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.435
Which way?

14:30.437 --> 14:31.736
Fastest way is
down the stairs.

14:31.738 --> 14:35.540
Come on, Robin.
We haven't a second to lose.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.409
Well, well.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.577
Chateau Le Duc '29.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.413
I didn't know
there was any left.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.116
I'm very much impressed.

14:48.855 --> 14:52.590
Batman and Robin.
This is an unexpected pleasure.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.524
Thank you.
This isn't a social visit.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.528
- May we approach, King Boris?
- It's an honor to meet you.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.064
How can I be of service?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.703
Your Majesty,
you're in great danger here.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.871
May we escort you
to your hotel?

15:06.873 --> 15:09.807
- Danger? That's ridiculous.
- We thought so too, but then--

15:09.809 --> 15:12.643
Oh, I've heard wondrous things
about you, Batman.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.979
But, this time,
I'm afraid you're wrong.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.614
First of all,
I'm with friends.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.817
Second, there is no political
threat against me

15:19.819 --> 15:20.584
I assure you.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.819
My country is small
and harmless

15:21.821 --> 15:25.489
my people, content and happy.
Who would want to..

15:41.040 --> 15:43.007
The king!
He's gone.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.675
What?

15:44.677 --> 15:46.877
Great Scott!
A trapdoor!

15:46.879 --> 15:48.446
Does anyone know
where this leads?

15:48.448 --> 15:51.415
I wasn't aware there
was a trapdoor here.

15:51.417 --> 15:56.020
Come on, Robin. There might be
an exit from outside the club.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.123
"Two steps to aid you
with my plot."

15:59.125 --> 16:01.692
That's no riddle.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.996
But those are.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.736
"How much dirt is in a hole
three acres square

16:11.738 --> 16:14.505
and 200 feet deep?"

16:14.507 --> 16:16.807
None. Because it's a hole.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.944
I suggest that's a bit
too elementary

16:19.946 --> 16:22.813
for our quizzical criminal.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.718
"If you're having difficulty
with the first

16:27.720 --> 16:31.589
"perhaps your young friend
can help you on this one.

16:31.591 --> 16:36.494
What won't run long
without winding?"

16:36.496 --> 16:39.664
"What won't run long
without winding?"

16:39.666 --> 16:42.200
Clock?

16:42.202 --> 16:44.102
Stairway!

16:44.437 --> 16:48.806
- A river?
- The Gotham river.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.610
We'll soon find out.
Come on, Robin.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.512
Back to the Batcave.

16:55.715 --> 17:01.619
Gotham City river bending
and winding...sections.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.691
Nothing there.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.728
- Negative again.
- Hold it.

17:10.730 --> 17:15.065
I think we may have something.
Let's take a closer look.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.670
That may be it.

17:19.672 --> 17:26.676
Gotham City Water and Power
Plant exact location

17:26.679 --> 17:29.313
and size.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.886
'This could be a clue.'

17:35.888 --> 17:40.190
A hole three acres wide
and 200 feet deep.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.326
I'll bet The Riddler
and his gang

17:42.328 --> 17:45.229
are holing up
with King Boris.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.598
Let's go and dig 'em out.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.766
And fast.

17:48.768 --> 17:53.904
<i> And at the obsolete</i>
<i> Water and Power Plant..</i>

17:54.974 --> 17:57.341
I don't know what kind
of rogues you are

17:57.343 --> 18:00.911
but I demand that you
release me this instant.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.712
Gee

18:01.714 --> 18:04.848
I never met royalty before.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.319
It's pretty thrilling.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.254
Royalty?

18:10.256 --> 18:13.090
You've never met royalty?

18:14.126 --> 18:18.762
And just whom do you think
stands before you

18:18.764 --> 18:20.664
My cherub?

18:20.666 --> 18:24.001
I am the Prince of Puzzlers

18:24.003 --> 18:25.970
the Count of Conundrums

18:25.972 --> 18:26.837
'the King of Crime.'

18:26.839 --> 18:30.608
My whole court here,
no one else..

18:37.016 --> 18:40.284
It's a good idea hiding
the Batmobile on that thicket.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.652
Nobody will spot it there.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.654
I hope nobody spots us
climbing this wall.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.924
Why don't we just break in
through the main entrance?

18:46.926 --> 18:48.792
Surprise attack style.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.662
Don't worry,
we'll catch them off guard.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.763
Through the ventilating system?

18:52.765 --> 18:55.833
First, I wanna make sure
we don't endanger King Boris

18:55.835 --> 18:58.669
when we make our entrance.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.151
Gosh! There could be
diplomatic repercussions

19:14.153 --> 19:15.886
if we fail this time,
Batman.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.920
That's not the point, Robin.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.255
What's important is that
the world knows

19:18.257 --> 19:22.026
that all visitors to these
teeming shores are safe.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.361
Be it a peasant
or a king.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.731
Gee, Batman, I never thought
of that. You're right.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.934
It's the very essence
of our democracy.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.643
Darn it..

19:38.645 --> 19:40.478
You have the Queen
of Freedom replica

19:40.480 --> 19:44.616
what possible good can it do
for you to keep me here?

19:44.618 --> 19:46.384
My fine sovereign friend.

19:46.386 --> 19:51.356
In your wildest imagination, you
could never begin to conceive

19:51.358 --> 19:53.892
my ingenious stratagem.

19:53.894 --> 19:55.627
If not ransom,
then what?

19:55.629 --> 19:59.998
You, my dear king,
have been reduced to a pawn.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.332
An important pawn however.

20:01.334 --> 20:06.537
For you will be used
to checkmate Batman

20:06.539 --> 20:11.376
'and his preposterous
Boy Wonder.'

20:13.413 --> 20:15.413
'When they show up..'

20:21.454 --> 20:25.891
...then my men will
escort you safely

20:25.893 --> 20:27.993
back to town..

20:27.995 --> 20:29.861
...with your statue.

20:32.199 --> 20:33.632
You want a piece of cheese?

20:33.634 --> 20:36.735
Not without a good vintage port,
you lackey.

20:43.210 --> 20:44.576
To quote an old axiom

20:44.678 --> 20:48.780
"The finer the bait,
the shorter the wait."

20:50.350 --> 20:52.717
Hey, king.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.921
Uh, we shouldn't have
to wait much longer.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.390
Batman fell for my clues.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.733
Alright, Riddler.

21:09.736 --> 21:14.939
Now you're going to fall
right into the hands of the law.

21:15.276 --> 21:17.842
Now, Whitey.

21:31.058 --> 21:34.759
Batman, we're caught
in this sticky trap.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.195
I-I-I can't get out of it.

21:37.197 --> 21:38.863
I-I can't move.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.364
Neither can I.

21:39.366 --> 21:43.068
It couldn't be more beautiful!

21:43.070 --> 21:48.940
Whoever heard of a bat
caught in a spider's web?

21:51.044 --> 21:52.410
Whitey, Fangs!

21:52.412 --> 21:56.114
Be sure to strap
them down good.

22:02.789 --> 22:03.722
I'm a man of my word.

22:03.724 --> 22:06.324
Whiskers! Whiskers, return
the statue to His Majesty

22:06.326 --> 22:10.395
and take him back to town.
Blindfolded of course.

22:12.432 --> 22:18.002
Oh, you were stupendous
as a pawn, king.

22:18.004 --> 22:22.941
Batman and Robin played it
right into my hands.

22:22.943 --> 22:24.109
Oh!

22:45.265 --> 22:47.933
Comfortable?
Huh.

22:52.339 --> 22:54.072
Batman..

22:54.074 --> 22:58.209
...these driveshafts rotate
1000 revolutions per second

22:58.211 --> 23:02.013
that means the centrifugal force
will tear the bones

23:02.015 --> 23:04.649
from your body.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.251
But before I start you spinning

23:06.253 --> 23:10.255
I'd like to spill off
one last riddle.

23:10.257 --> 23:15.660
You might have about a minute
to solve it before you die.

23:15.662 --> 23:16.595
Now, then.

23:16.597 --> 23:20.265
Why is a woman in love
like a welder?

23:23.904 --> 23:26.171
Goodbye, Batman.

23:31.244 --> 23:34.245
Goodbye, Boy Wonder.

23:42.055 --> 23:45.690
Take it easy...Robin.

23:49.162 --> 23:54.666
One bad turn deserves another.

24:01.374 --> 24:05.210
<i> Batman and Robin to die?</i>

24:05.212 --> 24:10.181
<i> Things certainly are turning</i>
<i> the wrong way for them.</i>

24:10.183 --> 24:12.217
<i> Is this really the end?</i>

24:12.219 --> 24:15.386
<i> Unbelievable!</i>

24:15.388 --> 24:17.622
<i> If you care</i>
<i> for Batman and Robin</i>

24:17.624 --> 24:19.424
<i> keep hoping</i>
<i> 'til tomorrow night.</i>

24:19.426 --> 24:24.095
<i> Same time.</i>
<i> Same Bat-channel.</i>
