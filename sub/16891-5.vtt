WEBVTT

00:01.270 --> 00:02.459
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:02.492 --> 00:04.794
All right, remember Emily
from the dress shop?

00:04.863 --> 00:05.996
Superhot chick?
Mm-hmm.

00:06.065 --> 00:08.934
We had the most amazing sex I
have ever had in my entire life.

00:09.003 --> 00:09.669
And?

00:09.738 --> 00:11.639
Afterwards, you know, we're
just layin' there when out

00:11.708 --> 00:15.546
of nowhere, the entire place reeks
like a sewer in a bad neighborhood.

00:15.614 --> 00:16.681
Well, listen, chief.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.550
I've been thinkin'.
I wanna be a lieutenant.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.585
You ace that text.

00:19.654 --> 00:22.891
I'll call downtown, make sure
you're assigned to a top house

00:22.960 --> 00:26.199
in the city. Just keep your nose clean
and your mouth shut till it happens.

00:26.268 --> 00:27.601
Nose clean. Mouth shut.

00:27.670 --> 00:28.503
No problem.

00:28.572 --> 00:29.371
Pam Keppler.

00:29.440 --> 00:29.939
Hi.

00:30.008 --> 00:30.507
Nice to meet you.

00:30.576 --> 00:31.209
This is the news chick.

00:31.278 --> 00:31.943
For what?

00:32.012 --> 00:32.812
The Jimmy thing.

00:32.881 --> 00:36.420
Look, Tommy, they're doin', like, a 9/11
tenth-anniversary special thing, ok?

00:36.488 --> 00:38.791
Oh, really? What's their angle,
huh, Franco? Is it the

00:38.860 --> 00:41.732
9/11 conspiracy? Is that their angle?
How about maybe that

00:41.800 --> 00:43.568
I slept with my cousin's wife?

00:43.637 --> 00:44.670
Is that what they're goin' for?

00:44.739 --> 00:49.279
There's been a lot of controversy since
9/11 involving the FDNY-- Alcohol and

00:49.348 --> 00:51.082
drug abuse... Mm-hmm.

00:51.151 --> 00:55.392
Allegations of racism in the
department's hiring practices,

00:55.460 --> 00:58.297
allegations of sexism, that
the department is nothing

00:58.365 --> 01:00.467
but a big boys club run amok.

01:00.536 --> 01:02.305
Ah, it's not what I agreed
to talk about here.

01:02.374 --> 01:03.608
You seem upset.

01:03.676 --> 01:06.312
You know what?
Next time your house catches on fire or

01:06.381 --> 01:08.383
somebody in your family gets
hurt or whatever, you know what?

01:08.452 --> 01:10.587
Instead of callin' us, call
a garbage truck.

01:10.655 --> 01:12.624
I'm done. You.

01:12.693 --> 01:17.734
[Bleep] you. [Bleep] you.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.871
Hey. What's up?

01:19.940 --> 01:22.609
Picked this up on the way
to work this morning.

01:22.678 --> 01:25.715
Seen 'em? "Effin' DNY."

01:25.784 --> 01:27.819
The "daily news."

01:27.888 --> 01:30.858
Yeah? What's "Newsday"

01:30.927 --> 01:31.860
got to say?

01:31.929 --> 01:33.764
"Mother of 6 wins lotto."

01:33.832 --> 01:36.802
Now, if she was blowin' a-rod, maybe
we wouldn't be in the papers.

01:36.870 --> 01:41.977
Heat's not only gonna hit us
hard, uh, it's already here.

01:42.046 --> 01:42.913
Aw, shit.

01:42.982 --> 01:45.685
Look, the only thing we could
salvage was the 9/11 charity

01:45.755 --> 01:48.157
game. They're gonna let you
play in the tenth-anniversary

01:48.226 --> 01:52.166
cops-versus-firefighters event
game because of the money that

01:52.234 --> 01:54.637
the charity can raise.
It's all could arrange, kiddo.

01:54.706 --> 01:55.840
You're lucky you got that.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.278
Kick the cops' asses, by the way,
'cause that's the last ass you're gonna

01:58.347 --> 01:59.247
be kickin' for a while.

01:59.315 --> 02:00.282
What's that supposed to mean?

02:00.351 --> 02:01.885
Upstairs, guys. Come on.

02:01.954 --> 02:06.995
I ain't got all day.

02:07.063 --> 02:09.800
Sorry, Tommy.

02:09.870 --> 02:13.274
Joey. King Joey III.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.576
What's going on, man?

02:14.645 --> 02:18.785
Ain't here as your old pal Joey, Tom.
I'm here as the department rep.

02:18.854 --> 02:22.258
Firefighter Gavin, my name is
supervisor Balsbaugh. You are

02:22.327 --> 02:28.069
hereby informed of a 30-day suspension
from duty as of 8AM today.

02:28.138 --> 02:31.475
Really? All right, what?

02:31.544 --> 02:32.477
I gotta sign this or something?

02:32.546 --> 02:33.813
'Cause I'm kind of
in a rush, guys.

02:33.882 --> 02:36.251
We're gonna need your badge,
your bunker jackets, your

02:36.319 --> 02:40.993
official department ID, Tom.

02:41.061 --> 02:45.535
All right, I don't even know
where my official ID is.

02:45.604 --> 02:47.740
I mean, listen. My--My kid, I
gotta take my kid to a dance

02:47.808 --> 02:49.777
class. Can I drop this stuff
off at headquarters later?

02:49.846 --> 02:52.983
Now. We need it now, all of it.

02:53.052 --> 02:54.520
Ok, Ballsby. Just relax.

02:54.589 --> 02:57.159
Names Balsbaugh. Balsbaugh.

02:57.227 --> 03:01.132
Let's go. Badge,
bunker jackets, ID, now.

03:01.201 --> 03:07.811
You dug your own hole here, Tom.
It's a deep one.

03:07.881 --> 03:09.215
Got it.

03:09.283 --> 03:12.253
We escort you in and out, asshole.
At any time you wanna

03:12.322 --> 03:15.559
enter the firehouse, you need a
rep from my office and a rep

03:15.628 --> 03:18.330
from the union to lead you
inside, right the hell back

03:18.399 --> 03:21.002
outside. Policy, pal. Airtight.

03:21.071 --> 03:23.608
Ok, you wanna slap a pair
of cuffs on me, too?

03:23.676 --> 03:26.980
What I hear, that's not exactly
foreign territory for you.

03:27.048 --> 03:29.819
Ah. You're funny.

03:33.059 --> 03:34.527
Ah, cover up, guys.

03:34.596 --> 03:35.061
We got company.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.530
What's going on?

03:36.599 --> 03:37.866
Well, guys.

03:37.934 --> 03:40.203
This is, uh, king Joey III here.

03:40.272 --> 03:41.172
How are you?

03:41.241 --> 03:42.976
Came up with me and, uh, Jimmy Keefe.
I guess he's down

03:43.044 --> 03:47.482
at HQ now. He's got 3 tits, thus the name.
You wanna show 'em,

03:47.551 --> 03:51.088
Joey? Huh? You still got the
third tit, right? It's funny.

03:51.157 --> 03:52.759
The third tit, it's kind of weird, too.
It's kind of like

03:52.827 --> 03:55.630
a--A midget tit.
Oh, and this is inspector Ballpeen?

03:55.698 --> 03:56.465
Balsbaugh.

03:56.534 --> 03:57.867
Bal-baldspot? Ballface?

03:57.936 --> 03:59.904
Balsbaugh.

03:59.973 --> 04:04.178
Yeah, ok. Anyways, you know,
you guys both know what I said

04:04.247 --> 04:08.254
on TV, a lot of it was true
in your heart of hearts, as

04:08.323 --> 04:11.226
firemen, which is what you used
to be before you started wearing

04:11.295 --> 04:15.902
your Sunday best to work, you know.
Look, guys, I'm out for,

04:15.970 --> 04:18.773
like, 30 days. And apparently
every time I come in here now,

04:18.841 --> 04:21.779
I gotta have 2 jerk-offs who
haven't fought fires in, like,

04:21.848 --> 04:26.253
15 years to escort me. You know?

04:26.323 --> 04:30.528
Hope you got-- Oh, yeah.
Here's my ID. Says, "firefighter"

04:30.597 --> 04:35.637
right on it. That's what I do,
fight fires and save people.

04:35.706 --> 04:39.678
You remember people.
They're the ones whose taxes are payin'

04:39.747 --> 04:46.323
for your Lincoln town cars, silk ties,
and your fancy goddamn computers.

04:46.392 --> 04:48.660
What Gavin was talking about
is department policy.

04:48.729 --> 04:51.598
Anyone aiding and abetting his
unsupervised entry into this

04:51.668 --> 04:55.037
firehouse over the next 30 days
will face the firm guarantee

04:55.106 --> 04:56.841
of suspension and possible fine.

04:56.910 --> 04:57.943
Any questions?

04:58.012 --> 04:58.577
Yeah.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.579
Yes, lieutenant?

04:59.648 --> 05:01.316
I'm tryin' to figure something out.
It's a technical

05:01.385 --> 05:04.755
question, really, but the third
tit, the midget tit, did it come

05:04.824 --> 05:06.359
with a little midget nipple?

05:06.427 --> 05:07.494
Let's go, Gavin.

05:07.563 --> 05:09.464
What? It's a perfectly
legitimate question.

05:12.071 --> 05:13.572
Oh, Franco, what's up, man?

05:13.641 --> 05:15.910
Aw, what's the matter, Franco?
We're being disrespectful to them?

05:15.979 --> 05:19.717
Hey, it is what it is.

05:19.785 --> 05:23.157
Tommy Gavin is officially down for the count.
I guess now we'll

05:23.225 --> 05:25.393
find out what this crew is like
without its major wonder boy,

05:25.463 --> 05:27.264
huh? Should be entertaining.

05:27.332 --> 05:30.370
You know, a lieutenant friend
of mine from the east side said

05:30.438 --> 05:32.539
that news chick, she's been
sniffin' around about Tommy's

05:32.608 --> 05:36.112
personal life and everybody
else's, too, so thanks to Tom,

05:36.181 --> 05:38.484
every single piece of dirt
attached to every goddamn guy

05:38.552 --> 05:42.892
in this house is now officially up for grabs.
Good times, huh?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.896
One down. 5 to go, fellas.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.152
What's that mean?

06:59.220 --> 07:01.519
That means those suits just
told me that Pam Keppler's news

07:01.588 --> 07:04.620
van's been parked outside of
HQ already twice this week.

07:04.688 --> 07:07.954
Her next big news story is to jump
into Tommy's personal life whole hog.

07:08.023 --> 07:08.655
Of course.

07:08.723 --> 07:11.321
And anybody else who stepped out
of line in the past 10 years.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.254
Great. Thanks, Tom.

07:12.323 --> 07:15.122
HQâ€™s droppin' the hammer, fellas.
I don't have to tell you

07:15.190 --> 07:17.222
she starts pointin' her bony
little fingers around, a lot

07:17.291 --> 07:18.690
of 'em are gonna be
pointed right at us.

07:18.758 --> 07:20.924
Nobody tried to talk to this crazy broad?
You know, scare tactics?

07:20.993 --> 07:21.757
It's not gonna work, Lou.

07:21.826 --> 07:22.824
She's got a hard-on for us.

07:22.893 --> 07:25.359
Tommy, look. You gotta lay low, all right?
Listen to me.

07:25.428 --> 07:26.192
No bullshit this time.

07:26.261 --> 07:28.627
Needles, I'm not afraid of her, ok?
She can bring whatever

07:28.696 --> 07:30.761
she wants. Like I said--
You're not listening to me.

07:30.829 --> 07:31.461
I'm listening to you.

07:31.530 --> 07:33.595
It's not just about you, asshole.
We have our careers

07:33.664 --> 07:36.263
on the line here. All right?
She starts diggin' around your shit,

07:36.331 --> 07:38.463
how hard you think that's gonna be?
It's buried under a patch

07:38.532 --> 07:42.532
of fresh earth. Would you please
think about us for once? Lou.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.399
I married a hooker.

07:43.468 --> 07:44.199
He married a hooker.

07:44.268 --> 07:46.200
I married a Russian
mail-order bride.

07:46.269 --> 07:47.834
Uh, I married Maggie.

07:47.903 --> 07:49.768
Which I'm bankin' on makes the
hooker and the mail-order

07:49.837 --> 07:50.902
bride seem a little sensible.

07:50.971 --> 07:51.835
I'm marrying Colleen.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.603
Which is gonna make marrying
Maggie look like a day at the

07:53.672 --> 07:54.870
beach. No offense, Tommy.

07:54.938 --> 07:55.637
None taken.

07:55.706 --> 07:57.837
Yeah, well, I guess I could
be considered a deadbeat dad.

07:57.905 --> 07:59.004
And a conspiracy freak.

07:59.072 --> 07:59.938
My gayness.

08:00.006 --> 08:00.871
The whole nun thing.

08:00.940 --> 08:01.872
Lesbo girlfriend.

08:01.941 --> 08:02.906
Extreme gayness.

08:02.975 --> 08:03.906
You wanna know what's sad?

08:03.975 --> 08:06.642
Him being gay is the least of
our public relations problem.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.375
Yeah, unless they find out that I
blew a guy down at headquarters once.

08:09.444 --> 08:12.976
Yeah, unless they find out that he
blew a guy down at headquarter--

08:18.180 --> 08:23.946
Mike, you blew a guy from headquarters,
or you blew a guy at headquarters?

08:24.014 --> 08:25.079
Both.

08:25.148 --> 08:27.581
Thank you, God in heaven,
for this wonderful gift.

08:27.649 --> 08:28.614
Wait a second. What guy?

08:28.683 --> 08:30.415
I don't remember his name, dude.

08:30.484 --> 08:31.615
How could you not know his name?

08:31.684 --> 08:32.349
We were drinking.

08:32.418 --> 08:33.216
Drinking at headquarters?

08:33.284 --> 08:35.616
No, no. No, first at a
Christmas party that was at a

08:35.684 --> 08:37.750
place, like, near headquarters,
but then we went back to his

08:37.818 --> 08:40.650
office at HQ, and-- And he put
some moves on me, and I took

08:40.720 --> 08:41.751
my shirt off and-- Ohh!

08:41.820 --> 08:43.284
Stop, Mike. Just-- Just stop.

08:43.354 --> 08:45.320
Guys, it wasn't cheap, you know?
This makes it sound

08:45.388 --> 08:47.355
cheap, and it-- And it wasn't.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.254
Doug. That was his name, Doug.

08:49.323 --> 08:51.154
Good. Doug.
How many Dougs can there be?

08:51.223 --> 08:51.889
Could be a lot of Dougs.

08:51.957 --> 08:52.922
Yeah. Doug Flutie.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.622
Doug Henning.

08:53.690 --> 08:54.322
Doug e. Fresh.

08:54.391 --> 08:55.089
Michael Douglas.

08:55.158 --> 08:55.889
Doogie Howser, M.D.

08:55.958 --> 08:56.523
He was a Doug.

08:56.592 --> 08:58.124
Michael Douglas doesn't
count as a Doug, Mike.

08:58.193 --> 08:59.291
Yeah, he's a Michael, Mike.

08:59.360 --> 08:59.924
Not a Doug.

08:59.993 --> 09:00.425
Mike.

09:00.493 --> 09:03.292
No, no, no, no. No, no.
The Doug that I blew looked like--

09:03.361 --> 09:07.594
Like a young, studly, in-shape Michael
Douglas type guy. And he had a nice ass.

09:07.662 --> 09:10.661
Ok, I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this.
Mike, do you think

09:10.730 --> 09:12.496
you can recognize the ass again?

09:12.564 --> 09:13.329
Yeah, sure.

09:13.397 --> 09:14.229
Ecch.

09:14.298 --> 09:16.563
Shut up. This is good, perfect, good.
Lou, I need you

09:16.632 --> 09:18.431
to get on the computer.
Find out how many Dougs are workin' down

09:18.500 --> 09:20.399
at HQ. We'll see if you can
bring up pictures of 'em, ok?

09:20.467 --> 09:22.433
Good-looking pictures of
Michael Douglas type Dougs.

09:22.501 --> 09:23.133
Got it.

09:23.202 --> 09:24.567
Are you guys really gonna
go through with this?

09:24.635 --> 09:26.401
Hey, our asses are on
the line here, pal.

09:26.469 --> 09:29.069
Yeah, Pam Keppler, all her TV
news cronies, not to mention

09:29.138 --> 09:31.870
the, you know, news reporters,
the newspapers, they're gonna

09:31.939 --> 09:32.771
crush us with this.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.373
Aw, Jesus Christ. I say we hit
'em now while we got the muscle.

09:37.441 --> 09:38.506
Frank Pentangelo.

09:38.575 --> 09:39.306
"Godfather ii."

09:39.374 --> 09:40.573
I didn't know you could
do that impression.

09:40.642 --> 09:42.074
You never asked.

09:42.143 --> 09:43.940
Doug would have asked.

09:44.009 --> 09:45.441
"Doug would have asked."

09:45.510 --> 09:48.342
All right, look, Tommy, I'm
gonna need you to go home.

09:48.411 --> 09:49.943
Don't do anything stupid
for about a month, ok?

09:50.011 --> 09:52.311
That's not gonna happen.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.212
Did I say that out loud?

09:54.280 --> 09:56.679
All right, Frankie, I need you to
round up-- I'm not gettin' involved.

09:56.747 --> 09:57.378
What?

09:57.447 --> 09:59.246
God almighty, you call
yourself a chief, and this is

09:59.314 --> 10:01.947
what you got your men doin',
chasin' after some guy Mike

10:02.015 --> 10:04.148
remembers blowin' after a
Christmas party? Really?

10:04.216 --> 10:06.215
Ok, you're gonna do 2 things.

10:06.284 --> 10:08.616
One, you're gonna remember who
the hell you're talkin' to,

10:08.684 --> 10:11.183
and 2, you're gonna figure out
whether you wanna be an officer

10:11.251 --> 10:13.684
in this man's army, and if you
do, you better learn the facts

10:13.753 --> 10:15.651
of life, and you better learn
'em goddamn quick, pal.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.485
You fight fire with fire.

10:17.553 --> 10:20.020
Oh, really? Last I heard,
it was with water, chief.

10:20.088 --> 10:22.721
You know, I'm movin' up, chief,
and I wanna do it clean.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.355
I already been dragged through
the mud with these guys by

10:24.423 --> 10:25.855
proxy. I ain't doin' it again.

10:25.924 --> 10:29.189
Here on out, I walk a
straight line that away.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.992
Black Shawn.

10:37.060 --> 10:37.526
Chief.

10:37.594 --> 10:39.893
Jesus. All right, listen.

10:39.961 --> 10:41.227
You're gonna call Pam Keppler.

10:41.296 --> 10:43.127
You're gonna tell her you know
a guy in this crew that's

10:43.195 --> 10:45.661
fascinated with 9/11
conspiracy theories.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.696
No can do, chief.
I mean, I'd do almost anything you ask,

10:48.764 --> 10:50.762
considering you're my commanding
officer, but there's no way

10:50.830 --> 10:54.130
I'm gonna throw a brother firefighter,
that being Franco, under the bus.

10:54.198 --> 10:59.032
Ooh, I'm not talkin' about Franco.
I'm talkin' about me.

11:05.397 --> 11:07.329
That was yet another
amazing date.

11:07.398 --> 11:08.829
Yeah, yeah. It was, wasn't it?

11:08.898 --> 11:11.064
I'm so glad I got you to
finally try that place.

11:11.133 --> 11:11.564
Yeah?

11:11.633 --> 11:12.431
Those potent margaritas.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.632
Yeah, weren't they, though?

11:13.700 --> 11:15.532
So were the nachos. Jeez.

11:15.601 --> 11:17.201
So do you wanna come upstairs?

11:17.269 --> 11:26.739
Uh, I, um, actually-- You-- You look
like you're holding something in.

11:26.807 --> 11:30.307
Um... Do you-- Do you need the toilet?
Is-- no, no, no. No. No, I'm good.

11:30.910 --> 11:31.308
Are you sure?

11:31.377 --> 11:32.075
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm sure.

11:32.143 --> 11:33.276
It's just-- ok.

11:33.345 --> 11:36.410
Ok, listen. Uh, this is gonna
sound silly and, uh, a little

11:36.479 --> 11:39.778
embarrassing honestly, and quite
frankly, I think it's pretty

11:39.846 --> 11:42.679
much in my head, so I just--
I promise I won't laugh.

11:42.748 --> 11:43.145
Really?

11:43.214 --> 11:43.612
Yeah.

11:43.681 --> 11:47.647
Ok. Here's what I have to say to you.
I think you're awesome,

11:47.716 --> 11:51.583
and you' the whole package, and I
have such a fantastic time with you.

11:51.651 --> 11:52.382
I think you're awesome, too.

11:52.451 --> 11:55.385
Thank you. Thank you.
No, I just--well, here's the thing.

11:55.453 --> 11:59.454
After we, you know, have sex--
amazing sex, by the way,

11:59.523 --> 12:02.522
the best sex I've ever had in my entire life.
It's-- there's this--

12:02.590 --> 12:03.922
it's the smell, right?

12:03.991 --> 12:06.224
Yes. Yes, it is. I'm--my God.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.058
There's this--something is
in your apartment, and it's

12:08.126 --> 12:11.426
really, really... it's my butt.

12:15.897 --> 12:19.731
Wow. I don't--yikes. Oh, wow.

12:19.799 --> 12:20.798
I didn't mean to
come off like that.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.531
I'm the one should be apologizing.
It's my smelly butt.

12:23.600 --> 12:30.436
Uh, well, ok. Are you, you know, ok?
I mean, are you, like, dying or anything?

12:30.504 --> 12:36.205
No. It's just this thing that
happens to me when I have sex.

12:36.274 --> 12:36.771
Ok.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.807
The penetration hits a muscle
back there, and afterwards,

12:40.876 --> 12:45.576
it give me gas.
Yeah, it's gross, I know.

12:45.645 --> 12:49.147
No, hey, hey, hey. Don't say that. Listen.
I just--I didn't know what it--

12:55.050 --> 12:57.016
thank God you have
such a small penis.

12:57.085 --> 13:00.250
Yeah. Thank God it's--huh?

13:00.319 --> 13:02.418
There were much worse results
when I was dating that center

13:02.487 --> 13:03.786
from the Knicks, if
you know what I mean.

13:03.854 --> 13:05.186
What do you mean I
have a small penis?

13:05.255 --> 13:08.186
I-I'm sorr--I really--I'm not
trying to be mean. I'd--I think

13:08.255 --> 13:09.354
you have a great little penis.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.454
Ok. Can we stop calling
it little, please?

13:11.522 --> 13:12.255
Modest?

13:12.323 --> 13:13.622
Yeah, that's--no.

13:13.690 --> 13:14.289
Petite.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.491
Yeah, I don't--ok, let's just call it little.
Ok? That's fine.

13:16.559 --> 13:17.123
Ok.

13:17.193 --> 13:19.625
Everybody has their flaws, right,
and-- I don't see them as flaws.

13:19.694 --> 13:21.260
I just think they're who we are.

13:21.328 --> 13:24.694
Yeah. You know what?
I don't think they're flaws either.

13:24.763 --> 13:25.662
They're just who we are.

13:25.731 --> 13:26.829
I like that.

13:26.897 --> 13:28.162
So you wanna come upstairs?

13:28.231 --> 13:31.964
Um, ok.

13:32.033 --> 13:33.866
Ok.

13:33.934 --> 13:38.669
However, tonight,
can we just cuddle?

13:38.737 --> 13:40.136
Hee hee.

13:40.205 --> 13:41.370
What?

13:41.439 --> 13:42.937
Uh, these are the Dougs.

13:43.006 --> 13:46.507
These are all the Dougs
that work down at HQ.

13:46.575 --> 13:52.878
No. Guys, none of these are my Doug.
Besides, the more I

13:52.946 --> 13:55.878
think about it, the more I think
my Doug's real first name was

13:55.947 --> 13:58.280
somethin' else.
You know, the people at the party,

13:58.349 --> 14:01.381
they called him Doug, but there
was a different name on his

14:01.450 --> 14:05.183
office door when we went back to,
you know--and plus, my Doug,

14:05.252 --> 14:09.253
he had, like, a--a beauty mark
on his cheek, kind of like Cindy

14:09.321 --> 14:13.455
Crawford. You know, kind of like
you do, chief. He had, like,

14:13.524 --> 14:16.422
masculine and feminine stuff
goin' on, you know, both at the

14:16.491 --> 14:18.123
same time. Kind of like you do.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.024
A-and you, too, chief. You know?

14:20.093 --> 14:23.592
I mean, both you guys, you're
both, like, really strong and--

14:23.661 --> 14:28.828
and very male, but you each,
like, definitely have, like,

14:28.897 --> 14:31.162
some soft stuff goin' on, too.

14:31.231 --> 14:36.231
You know? I-it's what makes you both
so approachable, you know. Anyway...

14:40.268 --> 14:42.668
And what am I, chopped liver?

14:42.736 --> 14:45.936
I mean, he wants soft, I
have 40 pounds of soft.

14:46.005 --> 14:47.737
Soft inside, Lou.

14:47.806 --> 14:50.139
Gruff exterior, soft inside.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.773
All right, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna sit down

14:51.842 --> 14:53.507
with Mike in front of the computer.
I'm gonna run by him

14:53.576 --> 14:57.744
the name and the photo of every
male working down at HQ till we

14:57.812 --> 15:00.645
find this Doug.
If we find anything, I will rush in here

15:00.714 --> 15:05.314
and give it to you 2
approachable bitches.

15:05.383 --> 15:07.816
Heh heh heh heh. 40 pounds.

15:07.884 --> 15:10.151
You know, it's more like 60.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.621
How you doin'?

15:15.689 --> 15:16.587
Hey, sorry about this.

15:16.656 --> 15:20.423
I'm just doin' my job.
My uncle was, uh, FDNY 35 years.

15:20.492 --> 15:21.191
Eh?

15:21.259 --> 15:21.924
Tommy Dunn.

15:21.992 --> 15:23.258
I know Tommy.

15:23.327 --> 15:24.091
He's a great guy.

15:24.160 --> 15:24.925
I'll tell him you said hello.

15:24.994 --> 15:27.093
Please do. You know, I'd love
to get in touch with him.

15:27.162 --> 15:27.927
I'll give you his number.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.894
Let me, uh-- Let me grab a
pen and piece of paper.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.528
That's great, pal. Thank you.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.897
Yeah, no problem.

15:34.965 --> 15:37.565
So, uh, I guess you're
here to see me, eh?

15:37.634 --> 15:40.600
No. It was a nice try, though.

15:40.669 --> 15:41.634
Nice try?

15:41.703 --> 15:44.802
Yeah. There's something very
heroic about a chief who's

15:44.871 --> 15:48.637
willing to draw all the negative attention
onto himself and away from his men.

15:48.706 --> 15:52.072
Well, you see, that's
what a leader does.

15:52.140 --> 15:55.707
Yeah. You know, this little
charm act of yours didn't work

15:55.775 --> 15:58.775
on me the last time.
Look, I've done my research, chief Nelson.

15:58.843 --> 16:01.077
There are a lot of firefighters
out there who don't like what's

16:01.145 --> 16:03.111
been going on in your crew
for the last 10 years.

16:03.180 --> 16:06.380
Ok-- Ok, I know that the
conspiracy guy is not you.

16:06.448 --> 16:09.048
I know it's the good-looking guy
with the cocky smile and the

16:09.117 --> 16:12.216
do-me dimples who believes that
the government purposely brought

16:12.318 --> 16:14.951
down the twin towers as an
excuse to attack an enemy in the

16:15.018 --> 16:18.652
middle east, and I find that
very interesting. America, not

16:18.720 --> 16:24.653
so much. They want sex, sex, and
drugs and murder, so the idea

16:24.722 --> 16:28.121
that Tommy Gavin slept with his
dead cousin's wife for almost

16:28.189 --> 16:32.389
7 years, brilliant.
And the fact that Tommy Gavin's wife had

16:32.458 --> 16:35.024
a baby with his murdered cop
brother during the same period

16:35.093 --> 16:38.626
of time, genius.
This is the kind of story that could make

16:38.695 --> 16:40.627
someone like me a national name.

16:40.696 --> 16:43.561
Your firehouse may be considered
the bottom of the barrel right

16:43.630 --> 16:48.995
now by the FDNY, but for me,
it is a goddamn gold rush.

16:49.064 --> 16:55.698
Heh. Well, you know, in Italian,
there's a name for people like you.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.566
Really? What's that?

16:57.635 --> 17:00.468
Miserable bitch.

17:00.537 --> 17:02.669
I've work for-- To do.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.970
Don't forget your broom.

17:10.474 --> 17:14.776
Hey. My card.

17:14.844 --> 17:15.509
Thank you.

17:15.578 --> 17:16.976
My uncle's info's on the back.

17:17.045 --> 17:18.676
Thanks, pal.

17:27.249 --> 17:29.848
Thank you.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.288
Where were you?

17:46.357 --> 17:48.189
Traffic.

17:48.258 --> 17:49.122
What do you got?

17:49.191 --> 17:52.958
All right, look, the Doug that
Mike had sex with--I know.

17:53.026 --> 17:55.492
Turns out his first name's
probably not Doug, but he still

17:55.561 --> 17:57.892
looks like a young Michael
Douglas, and he's got a beauty

17:57.960 --> 17:59.926
mark on his cheek
just like mine.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.527
You mean a mole.

18:02.596 --> 18:06.195
It's a beauty mark, ok?
Cindy Crawford's got one of these.

18:06.263 --> 18:09.129
Cindy Crawford also has tits.

18:09.197 --> 18:11.797
Here's what I got from Keppler.
She's gonna talk about

18:11.866 --> 18:14.465
Johnny and Janet.
She's also gonna talk about you and Sheila.

18:14.534 --> 18:15.499
And we gotta get somethin'

18:15.568 --> 18:18.068
on this broad, Tommy, and we
gotta get it quick. I got some

18:18.136 --> 18:20.869
information from one of the guys on her crew.
Turns out somebody

18:20.938 --> 18:23.937
got a DUI last month, and
there's no police record of it,

18:24.006 --> 18:26.406
which leads me to believe that
the cops know somethin' we

18:26.474 --> 18:30.308
don't. I reached out to Johnny's old partner.
Dead end. Moved to

18:30.377 --> 18:33.410
Seattle. Here's what I need you to do.
You know that cop you're

18:33.478 --> 18:34.444
always fightin' with on the ice?

18:34.513 --> 18:36.978
You find him, and you see
what he knows about this.

18:37.047 --> 18:39.480
Todd? Todd hates me.

18:39.548 --> 18:40.913
Pam Keppler hates you.

18:40.982 --> 18:42.313
Keppler has a TV show.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.114
Todd doesn't. Find Todd.

18:44.182 --> 18:47.482
See what he knows, and if he
does know anything, you do

18:47.550 --> 18:50.516
whatever you need to do
to get the information.

18:50.585 --> 18:52.016
Whatever I need to do?

18:52.085 --> 18:53.650
Yeah.

18:53.719 --> 18:55.184
Wh-what are you implying?

18:55.253 --> 18:56.485
I'm not implying anything.

18:56.554 --> 18:58.919
I'm tellin' you. Throw the game.

18:58.988 --> 19:02.021
You realize this is-- The
hockey game is for the tenth

19:02.090 --> 19:04.755
anniversary of 9/11.
It's like the-- The biggest charity hockey

19:04.824 --> 19:05.623
game we've ever played.

19:05.692 --> 19:07.657
It's in the memory of
our fallen brothers.

19:07.725 --> 19:10.258
We're doin' this for our
fallen brothers. Look, she

19:10.326 --> 19:12.525
starts namin' you and Sheila,
she's gonna name all the other

19:12.594 --> 19:13.559
firefighters that are sleepin'

19:13.627 --> 19:16.193
with the widows.
Look, me and you know it's about emotional

19:16.262 --> 19:19.461
bonding and shared grief, but to
these people, this is tawdry sex

19:19.530 --> 19:20.761
and headlines, my friend.

19:20.830 --> 19:21.862
There's chum in the water.

19:21.931 --> 19:27.531
We gotta protect our own.
Tommy, this is for the greater good.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.731
What?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.166
Cindy Crawford... yeah.

19:31.235 --> 19:37.502
Pretty sure she doesn't have
hair growin' out of her mole.

19:37.570 --> 19:42.372
Or a cock.

19:42.441 --> 19:46.075
Hey, Todd. Hey.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.508
Hold on a second.

19:47.577 --> 19:48.208
What's going on?

19:48.277 --> 19:51.777
Well, if it isn't TVâ€™s Tommy Gavin.
To what do I owe this pleasure, Tom? Let me

19:51.845 --> 19:54.178
guess. The FDNY finally got rid
of your skinny, little ass,

19:54.247 --> 19:55.212
and now you wanna be a cop.

19:55.281 --> 19:59.014
Funny.
Listen, I, uh-- I need a favor.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.681
Oh, my God. Holy shit, Tom.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.783
Where are the TV cameras and the
reporters when you really need

20:03.851 --> 20:05.683
'em? You need a favor from me?

20:05.752 --> 20:07.351
Listen, can I talk
to you for a second?

20:07.420 --> 20:08.518
Don't touch.

20:08.586 --> 20:12.920
Here's the deal.
This, uh, broad, she's, uh-- She's gonna do

20:12.989 --> 20:16.121
a story about my wife and my brother.
Now, obviously, that's

20:16.190 --> 20:19.257
not good news for me, and-- And I
would have gone through Johnny's

20:19.325 --> 20:22.791
old partner, but as you know,
he moved to Seattle, so I-I'm

20:22.860 --> 20:23.858
desperate. I can use anything.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.826
Old parking tickets, a DUI.

20:25.894 --> 20:32.328
I don't know. Anything you can dig up.
And, uh, you know, I'd

20:32.397 --> 20:35.397
be willin' to trade up on this.

20:35.466 --> 20:40.265
I-- You know-- Almost willing to do anything.
I'll-- I'll even

20:40.334 --> 20:42.200
throw the anniversary game.

20:42.269 --> 20:45.002
You can kiss my fat
Irish ass, numb nuts.

20:45.071 --> 20:46.069
What?

20:46.138 --> 20:48.837
We don't play fixed games, Tom,
especially against teams we

20:48.906 --> 20:49.972
know we can e beat, all right?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.505
And another thing.
I highly recommend you keepin' your head

20:52.574 --> 20:54.406
up tomorrow afternoon, 'cause
I'm gonna kick your little

20:54.475 --> 20:58.675
midget dick all over the ice.

20:58.743 --> 21:00.442
Thanks for nothin'.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.476
You're welcome, Tom.

21:02.545 --> 21:04.277
Asshole.

21:15.862 --> 21:18.164
Oh, hey, listen.
Before I forget, it took us a while, but

21:18.233 --> 21:20.701
I finally got Mike to remember
the name of his friend, you

21:20.770 --> 21:24.741
know, his little buddy from the,
uh, Christmas party. Doug is his

21:24.810 --> 21:27.713
name. And some other pertinent information.
Do with it what you like.

21:27.782 --> 21:28.547
You know, I'm just sayin'

21:28.616 --> 21:31.453
I still don't feel right about it, you know?
Like I feel like a rat.

21:31.522 --> 21:33.056
You know, relax, Mike, all right?
You're doin' it for

21:33.125 --> 21:34.358
the good of the entire
crew, all right?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.861
Yeah, what are you talking about?
Come on. It's us against

21:35.930 --> 21:37.766
them at this point.
They play dirty, we play dirty.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.402
Remember what needles said.

21:39.471 --> 21:42.241
What?

21:42.310 --> 21:43.444
What did needles say?

21:43.513 --> 21:44.512
You're a moron.

21:44.581 --> 21:46.049
No, that wasn't it.

21:46.118 --> 21:48.119
Fight fire with fire.

21:48.187 --> 21:50.590
You-- Pfft! Well, I would
have remembered that. Hello.

21:50.659 --> 21:54.464
All right, everybody! Hey, shut up!
Listen up! Lot of you

21:54.533 --> 21:59.507
firemen know I can't drink no more for
reasons you cops already have on file.

22:00.844 --> 22:05.116
Well, here's a guy who ain't an alcoholic,
but he just retired, and he's doin'

22:05.184 --> 22:08.722
everything in his power to become
one, chief Lugnut Lombardi.

22:10.461 --> 22:12.361
Go ahead, chief. All right.

22:12.430 --> 22:14.165
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

22:14.234 --> 22:17.738
Thank you. It was an honor
to watch 2 fine departments

22:17.807 --> 22:21.678
do battle out there together
for a great, great cause.

22:21.747 --> 22:26.487
Game ended in a tie, deservedly so.
Now, let's decide

22:26.556 --> 22:28.257
who wins the drinking contest.

22:31.431 --> 22:35.669
Hey, guys, captain of the police team,
some people think a tie game is like

22:35.738 --> 22:38.006
kissing your sister...

22:38.075 --> 22:40.911
But in honor of those that
died on both sides on that

22:40.980 --> 22:45.252
fateful day, this seems more like
throwin' a friendly arm around all our

22:45.321 --> 22:46.555
firefighting brothers.

22:48.828 --> 22:51.397
Now, uh, I just got somethin'

22:51.465 --> 22:55.504
to say. Too bad 9/11 wasn't a
tie, 'cause the last time I

22:55.573 --> 23:02.650
looked, it was
firefighters 343, NYPD 23.

23:04.723 --> 23:05.757
Simmer down, dickface.

23:05.826 --> 23:06.792
Yeah, whatever.

23:06.861 --> 23:07.860
Ohh!

23:22.825 --> 23:24.959
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin'?

23:25.028 --> 23:27.531
What do you mean?
What-- I came out here to help you.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.436
You remember you asked me to
dig some stuff up on that news

23:30.505 --> 23:31.305
broad, the one that's doin'

23:31.374 --> 23:32.005
the story about you?

23:32.074 --> 23:32.741
Yeah.

23:32.809 --> 23:34.010
Well, guess what, pal.

23:34.078 --> 23:38.083
Jackpot.
Larry Loch Ness, meet Tommy Gavin.

23:38.152 --> 23:40.254
Hey. Seen you on TV.

23:40.322 --> 23:43.760
Loch Ness works out of the
15th, all right. He's an old

23:43.829 --> 23:45.363
buddy of mine. So get this.

23:45.431 --> 23:47.867
Picks up Pam Keppler about
a year and a half ago on

23:47.936 --> 23:49.169
a cocaine possession charge.

23:49.238 --> 23:50.672
He recognizes her right away.

23:50.741 --> 23:54.814
She begs to get out of it, Tom, all right?
So Loch Ness decides

23:54.882 --> 23:58.454
to offer her a deal. And?

23:58.522 --> 23:59.255
She blew me.

23:59.323 --> 24:00.090
What?

24:00.159 --> 24:02.494
Ah, yeah. Lookit. Lookit.

24:02.563 --> 24:03.563
Wh-whoa.

24:03.632 --> 24:04.732
Yeah. Oh, it's her.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.734
No, no. I know it's her.

24:05.802 --> 24:07.403
What's that?

24:07.472 --> 24:09.874
Now you know why they
call me Loch Ness.

24:09.943 --> 24:14.149
He's got video on there, too, Tom.
Take her down, all right?

24:14.217 --> 24:17.187
She's a hypocrite and a cokehead,
and she's callin' you out?

24:17.255 --> 24:20.058
Guys, this is awesome.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.193
I'm-- I don't know what to say.

24:21.262 --> 24:22.496
I owe you guys.

24:22.564 --> 24:25.335
We're not doin' this for you, Tom, ok?
We're doin' this

24:25.404 --> 24:27.438
for our brother, Johnny. Ok?

24:27.507 --> 24:30.911
You think we want his good name
stomped on by some TV coke slut?

24:30.980 --> 24:32.380
Let me tell you somethin'.

24:32.450 --> 24:34.551
As good as a fireman you're
supposed to be... yeah.

24:34.620 --> 24:37.391
Your brother Johnny was 10
times a better cop. All right,

24:37.459 --> 24:39.929
so you take this stuff, Tom, and
you go ruin that broad, all

24:39.997 --> 24:43.803
right? Just make sure Johnny's
name doesn't get mentioned. Ok?

24:43.871 --> 24:44.503
Ok.

24:44.572 --> 24:46.374
Oh, oh. Oh, and one more thing.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.477
What?

24:47.545 --> 24:48.245
Take this.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.518
Who the hell called the cops?

24:51.586 --> 24:52.653
I did. You guys are gettin'

24:52.722 --> 24:53.689
your asses kicked in there.

24:53.757 --> 24:56.026
I figured you could
use some backup.

25:00.971 --> 25:03.173
Another ginger ale, Tom?

25:03.242 --> 25:06.212
No.

25:07.850 --> 25:08.950
After you.

25:12.725 --> 25:13.692
I just don't understand, ok?!

25:13.761 --> 25:14.728
What's goin' on?

25:14.796 --> 25:18.268
I am so sick of this! Ok, I'm sick of all of it!
Just get out of my way!

25:18.337 --> 25:20.339
What the-- What's goin' on?

25:20.408 --> 25:21.842
You ruined the wedding, dad.

25:21.911 --> 25:24.180
You've ruined it, and everyone
at school's making fun of me

25:24.249 --> 25:26.451
because my dad gave the
middle finger in the paper!

25:26.520 --> 25:35.199
Ohh. Jeez. What the hell's--
What's happening? Hello.

25:35.268 --> 25:41.444
You gonna bring him up to speed, or...
Ok, the new place that Shawn

25:41.512 --> 25:44.248
and Colleen were looking at for
their wedding, they saw that the

25:44.317 --> 25:46.352
last name was Gavin, that you're
the firefighter who's been

25:46.421 --> 25:49.057
in all the papers, and-- And they
told them both to take a hike.

25:49.125 --> 25:53.164
No, it was 2 places, ok?
The second place, we lied and told

25:53.233 --> 25:54.801
them that you weren't my father,
and then they found out anyway.

25:54.869 --> 25:57.406
And you know what?
Right now, I really wish you weren't.

25:57.474 --> 25:58.708
Hey, Colleen. That's enough.

25:58.777 --> 26:02.181
Hey, you know what?
You come out here right now, and you

26:02.250 --> 26:08.727
apolo-- Holy shi-- Wait. What-- Whoa!
What the hell? You--

26:08.796 --> 26:11.833
Colleen, get your ass out
here and clean this mess up.

26:11.902 --> 26:12.767
Go to hell!

26:12.836 --> 26:14.170
I hate you, daddy!

26:14.239 --> 26:18.110
Please let me pay for the wedding and
let me get one of those other places.

26:18.279 --> 26:20.781
No, Sheila. No.
How many times do I have to tell you? No.

26:20.849 --> 26:22.183
Wow, wow, wow. Calm down.

26:22.252 --> 26:23.218
I'm just tryin'

26:23.287 --> 26:25.054
to help you, so-- Well,
does it look like it's

26:25.124 --> 26:26.958
helping? No.
You are making things worse.

26:27.027 --> 26:35.274
Ok, can I just ask a question? Ok?
Are you guys all Lance Armstronging?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.110
Oh, you-- I'm just asking, ok?

26:37.179 --> 26:38.312
Seriously?

26:38.381 --> 26:39.681
What's go-- What's the place?

26:39.750 --> 26:40.583
What are you talking about?

26:40.652 --> 26:42.020
What place?

26:42.089 --> 26:48.533
I'm talking about-- There's a place in
Jersey near where I take Damian for his

26:48.602 --> 26:51.505
German aquatherapy.
Then there's a place in Connecticut near

26:51.574 --> 26:55.613
where I take him for his movement therapy.
They are both mansions... mansions.

26:55.681 --> 27:00.521
They are both gorgeous, and
they're both expensive. I want

27:00.590 --> 27:04.195
to pay. I wanna pay for the whole thing, ok?
No one's gonna

27:04.263 --> 27:06.833
know out there that your face
was all over the papers, and

27:06.902 --> 27:11.708
besides which, Colleen and Mike
have changed their minds about

27:11.777 --> 27:15.915
Mike designing the dress, because he has
come across a dress that he-- And I'm

27:15.984 --> 27:18.453
quoting-- Says, "is to die for."

27:18.522 --> 27:20.991
Ok, Tommy, I do not want her
to pay for our daughter's

27:21.060 --> 27:24.198
wedding, especially when she
is not even gonna be involved.

27:24.266 --> 27:24.865
Oh, my God.

27:24.934 --> 27:25.500
Yeah. Ask her.

27:25.569 --> 27:26.201
Wha-what?

27:26.270 --> 27:28.940
How many times do I have to tell you
I want her to be in the wedding?!

27:29.009 --> 27:31.077
Yes, and she has made it
abundantly clear that she does

27:31.145 --> 27:33.448
not want to be in the wedding if
your uncle Mickey is involved,

27:33.516 --> 27:36.721
and your uncle Mickey deserves
to be in the wedding, right?

27:36.790 --> 27:39.426
Do you want me to start drinking again?
Is that what you guys want?

27:39.495 --> 27:40.128
No.

27:40.197 --> 27:42.333
I've never asked you guys for
anything, and now auntie Sheila

27:42.401 --> 27:44.236
wants to help. Ok, I don't
understand what the problem is

27:44.305 --> 27:45.672
I can't afford the kind
of wedding that you want.

27:45.741 --> 27:46.774
We can't even afford the dress.

27:46.843 --> 27:47.409
Uhh!

27:47.478 --> 27:48.110
Tommy, tell her.

27:48.179 --> 27:50.215
Mom, I don't want Colleen
to drink anymore.

27:50.284 --> 27:52.051
Oh, no one's gonna
drink anymore.

27:52.121 --> 27:53.655
Ok, Sheila, you know what?

27:53.723 --> 27:55.290
I can handle my own kids, ok?

27:55.359 --> 27:58.028
Ok.

27:58.097 --> 27:59.765
Ok, no one is gonna
drink anymore.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.868
Oh, wow.
That was so much better.

28:01.938 --> 28:02.570
Watch your mouth.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.373
Hey! What-- You know what?

28:04.442 --> 28:05.474
I need a drink.

28:05.543 --> 28:06.610
Oh, no, you do not.

28:06.679 --> 28:07.445
Oh, no, no, no!

28:07.514 --> 28:08.180
Colleen! Colleen! Colleen!

28:08.249 --> 28:13.656
Hey. Hey! Would--

28:13.725 --> 28:18.265
What the hell? You gotta be shittin' me.
Nobody's gonna

28:18.334 --> 28:25.112
drink, ok? Everybody calm down.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.849
How much money we talkin' about?

28:26.918 --> 28:28.718
8 grand.

28:28.787 --> 28:29.887
For the wedding?

28:29.956 --> 28:34.129
For the dress.

28:34.198 --> 28:35.565
I need a whiskey.

28:35.633 --> 28:36.165
No!

28:36.235 --> 28:37.435
No, no, no, no!

28:38.740 --> 28:39.405
Stop!

28:46.353 --> 28:48.254
What's he trying to tell us?

28:48.323 --> 28:50.894
Probably that he wants to
be put up for adoption.

28:50.963 --> 28:51.995
Ohh!

28:52.064 --> 28:55.701
All right. Katy, Colleen,
take him into his room.

28:55.771 --> 28:56.470
Let's go. Hurry up.

28:56.538 --> 28:58.307
And clean up that mess.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.742
Come on. It's ok.

28:59.811 --> 29:04.183
You two, sit down. I wanna talk to you right now.
Hurry it up, girls.

29:14.538 --> 29:27.057
Really? Ok. I am sick and tired
of being treated like a ghost

29:27.126 --> 29:31.197
around here, ok? You wanna start
talkin' about, you know, uh,

29:31.266 --> 29:38.645
father figures. Well, I ain't no figure.
I'm the real deal, and

29:38.714 --> 29:44.790
I'm gonna lay some, uh, new laws
down around here, ok? First of

29:44.859 --> 29:49.131
all, Sheila is gonna be a
part of that wedding. Ah-ah!

29:49.200 --> 29:53.539
Done deal. And she's gonna need
somebody to walk her down the

29:53.608 --> 29:59.016
aisle, because God knows Damian
ain't gonna do it. Listen to me.

29:59.085 --> 30:02.489
You been sold a bill of goods by
a serious of snake-oil salesmen,

30:02.558 --> 30:05.228
ok? Nobody's had the balls to
say this to you, but I just got

30:05.297 --> 30:09.803
my balls back, so I'm gonna say it.
Mickey was right. The kid is

30:09.872 --> 30:14.077
as is, all right? He ain't ever
gettin' out of that wheelchair

30:14.146 --> 30:17.283
again. So-- Ah-ah! Sit down.

30:17.352 --> 30:23.996
You're in that wedding, and
Mickey's gonna be in that wedding.

30:24.065 --> 30:26.199
Ohh.

30:26.268 --> 30:29.606
And you can wipe that little
smirk off your face, sweetheart,

30:29.674 --> 30:33.046
'cause I got some news for you, too.
Sheila is paying for that

30:33.114 --> 30:34.848
wedding. And we're-- Ah-ah!

30:34.917 --> 30:38.522
Listen, you wanna see Colleen
passed out shitfaced again

30:38.591 --> 30:40.760
on the beach somewhere? Huh?

30:40.829 --> 30:45.235
Can you put a price tag on her sobriety?
I don't think so.

30:45.303 --> 30:48.941
So we're takin' Sheila's money,
and Colleen's gonna have

30:49.010 --> 30:52.214
the greatest day in the history
of all the days that she's ever

30:52.283 --> 30:55.954
gonna have. That's what we're doin'.
And I'm gonna pay back

30:56.023 --> 30:58.693
all that money, every single penny of it.
You can bet your

30:58.761 --> 31:00.830
pretty little asses on that.

31:00.898 --> 31:02.699
Yay.

31:02.768 --> 31:04.670
Oh. Oh, come on in, girls.

31:04.738 --> 31:13.285
Join the party. Maybe you'll
learn a thing or two. L right,

31:13.354 --> 31:17.325
this is a dysfunctional family.

31:17.394 --> 31:19.295
I know. Call the newspapers.

31:19.364 --> 31:25.172
There's a headline for you.
It's a family full of drunks and drug

31:25.242 --> 31:36.927
addicts and liars and cheaters and stealers.
Ok? We've lied and

31:36.996 --> 31:40.767
cheated and stole our way around
each other for God knows how

31:40.835 --> 31:44.373
long, and-- And where did we end up?
Where'd it get us? Nowhere.

31:44.441 --> 31:46.176
Yeah, that's right. Nowhere.

31:46.245 --> 31:48.146
Right back here where we-- Where we started.
That's where we

31:48.214 --> 31:51.852
ended up, where we all belong.

31:51.920 --> 31:59.901
Now, some people would say that
the truth will set you free. The

31:59.970 --> 32:05.979
truth is-- You know, the truth
will cleanse you and-- And

32:06.047 --> 32:16.130
elevate your spirit.
I say that the truth can kiss our lying

32:16.199 --> 32:21.339
Irish asses, because I'll tell you somethin'.
The truth will be

32:21.408 --> 32:27.350
used by the enemy, the outside
world, as ammunition against us.

32:27.419 --> 32:28.419
And believe me, they're gettin'

32:28.488 --> 32:32.727
ready to do exactly that,
but I have secret evil plan

32:32.796 --> 32:35.865
that plays to our strengths...

32:35.934 --> 32:42.343
A plan that involves lying and--
And cheating and stealing.

32:42.413 --> 32:44.513
You know, they're always sayin',
the media's always talkin'

32:44.582 --> 32:47.653
about, you know, TV and-- And the
magazines and everything, that

32:47.721 --> 32:51.291
sex sells. Well, we are gonna
sell them right down the goddamn

32:51.360 --> 32:59.708
river. Listen. Please believe
me when I say that you need

32:59.776 --> 33:03.548
to accept the fact that Damian
is never getting out of that

33:03.617 --> 33:07.589
wheelchair, and I'm telling you
this-- Because I love

33:07.657 --> 33:19.343
you. And as much as I love
her, I love you even more.

33:32.636 --> 33:35.373
All right, girls.
I want this place cleaned up by the time I

33:35.441 --> 33:37.877
get back, spic and span.
Sheila, outside. I'm gonna give you

33:37.946 --> 33:41.684
your assignment now.
I'm gonna go pick up my godson from that

33:41.753 --> 33:50.568
God-awful aromatherapy bullshit class.
Till then, toodles.

34:02.495 --> 34:04.306
Hold it. Up, up!

34:15.869 --> 34:22.873
Oh. Move. Ah, I am so glad
that you decided to do this.

34:22.940 --> 34:26.274
It'll give you a chance to
tell your side of the story,

34:26.342 --> 34:32.947
give us-- Let us experience the emotional
side of 9/11 and its aftermath.

34:33.016 --> 34:37.149
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

34:37.217 --> 34:38.351
Are you ready?

34:38.420 --> 34:41.454
I think I need
some-- Some water.

34:41.522 --> 34:43.556
Yes. Water! Water, please.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.458
I-- I changed my mind.

34:45.527 --> 34:48.995
We're fine.

34:49.063 --> 34:49.763
Ok.

34:49.831 --> 34:51.331
Rolling.

34:51.400 --> 34:56.969
So after your husband's death,
after they found only his

34:57.039 --> 35:01.907
finger in the wreckage and
rubble at ground zero, did you

35:01.976 --> 35:04.610
find yourself turning to certain
family members for healing

35:04.678 --> 35:10.247
to deal with the grief
and the anguish?

35:10.315 --> 35:13.350
Do you mean Tommy?

35:13.418 --> 35:22.389
Yes. Uh, did you find yourself turning
to his brother in arms, his best friend,

35:22.458 --> 35:26.094
and his cousin, Tommy Gavin?

35:26.162 --> 35:32.599
Hell, yeah. Baby, I banged his brains out.
We had mad,

35:32.667 --> 35:38.504
insane, explosive sex almost
every single time we put our

35:38.572 --> 35:41.574
hands on each other, and you
wanna know why? Because we

35:41.642 --> 35:46.645
could. Sometimes we had angry sex,
sometimes we had happy sex,

35:46.713 --> 35:51.416
and sometimes we had "atom bomb
going off in the apartment" sex,

35:51.484 --> 35:57.321
but one thing was always
certain, and that was every

35:57.390 --> 36:01.592
single time Tommy was inside
of me, I never thought about

36:01.661 --> 36:10.932
my dead hero husband.
I just enjoyed the ride. I even have

36:11.001 --> 36:18.706
some video. You know, 'cause
when Tommy and I had sex, we did

36:18.774 --> 36:23.810
it because we really-- We needed
it desperately. You know, we--

36:23.879 --> 36:27.848
We hungered for it.
And it was a pretty honest transaction,

36:27.917 --> 36:30.984
because we got what we wanted
out of each other, you know,

36:31.052 --> 36:36.389
kind of just like this.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.891
Yeah, Pam. Aw, suck it.

36:38.960 --> 36:44.327
Suck it. Yeah. Go, Pam-- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sit down, big mouth. And when I say,

36:44.396 --> 36:49.232
"big mouth," I think we all know
how big it is now, don't we? Sit

36:49.301 --> 36:55.670
down. You drop that story, or I
swear to Christ that'll end up

36:55.739 --> 37:01.743
on YouTube. Yeah? What's that you
guys say now? That's a wrap?

37:01.812 --> 37:06.081
Bye.

37:32.605 --> 37:36.605
Hello. Uh, I have an appointment,
uh, with supervisor Balsbaugh

37:36.674 --> 37:38.006
in lieutenant Hanrahan's office.

37:38.075 --> 37:39.041
I'm a little late.

37:39.110 --> 37:44.078
They're waiting for you.

37:44.147 --> 37:45.013
Sheel.

37:45.081 --> 37:45.747
Joey.

37:45.816 --> 37:48.749
Come on in.
This is supervisor Balsbaugh.

37:48.818 --> 37:49.550
Nice to meet you.

37:49.619 --> 37:50.151
Nice to meet you.

37:50.220 --> 37:52.186
Lieutenant Hanrahan is,
uh, 2 seconds away.

37:52.255 --> 37:52.887
Ok.

37:52.956 --> 37:53.720
How you doing?

37:53.789 --> 37:55.989
You know, Joey,
I've been better.

37:56.058 --> 37:58.024
You know, we thought we saw you
down there talkin' to that

37:58.093 --> 38:01.360
news station. You know, it's a
terrible mess they started here.

38:01.428 --> 38:05.063
I'm sorry about all this, and I
hope you told her what's what.

38:05.132 --> 38:08.499
Let's cut to the chase here, Mrs.
Keefe. I didn't know your

38:08.568 --> 38:11.902
husband personally, but I know
who he was, what he did for his

38:11.971 --> 38:14.336
country on that fateful day.

38:14.405 --> 38:17.439
His record is the reason we
agreed to sit and talk to you.

38:17.508 --> 38:22.645
We owe him that. We owe you that
anytime you desire it. But let's

38:22.713 --> 38:27.050
be clear here. This whole business ain't
about your husband. It's about your

38:27.119 --> 38:33.055
boyfriend. He's a scourge, a
stain on this department, and

38:33.124 --> 38:35.257
if you think comin' down here
and pleading his case is gonna

38:35.325 --> 38:36.625
change anything, guess again.

38:36.693 --> 38:41.563
He's out for 30 days, and if
I had my way, maybe forever.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.433
I'm dead serious, Mrs. Keefe.

38:46.502 --> 38:51.938
So am I. Oh, lieutenant Hanrahan.
Robert D. Hanrahan.

38:52.006 --> 38:54.841
Yes. Welcome, Mrs. Keefe.

38:54.909 --> 38:57.976
I-- I saw you on the TV.

38:58.045 --> 39:01.080
Oh, I know.
Your friends call you Doug, right?

39:01.148 --> 39:03.048
Uh, that's right.
Feel free to do the same.

39:03.117 --> 39:06.017
Ok, Dougie boy. Dougie Doug.

39:06.086 --> 39:11.255
Heh heh. Wow. It's hot in here.

39:11.324 --> 39:14.492
I, um-- I need a drink.

39:14.561 --> 39:20.331
Um, those flowers there are
from Mike Siletti at 62 truck.

39:20.399 --> 39:24.133
You remember him, right?
He has a little birthmark, a little

39:24.202 --> 39:28.337
brown birthmark kind of like the
one that you have on your cheek,

39:28.405 --> 39:33.441
except that his is on his ass.

39:33.509 --> 39:45.685
Ooh. Sexy.
Do you guys-- I'm sorry. No?

39:55.997 --> 40:04.101
Phew. Yah! Bouncy.

40:04.170 --> 40:08.905
Good for you. Isn't having booze
in here against department

40:08.974 --> 40:13.709
regulations? But then again,
so is having sex in here after

40:13.778 --> 40:27.686
hours. Yeah? Mike said something
about-- Wait a minute. You're not

40:27.755 --> 40:34.325
a policeman, are you? Heh heh.

40:37.397 --> 40:38.730
Hey. What happened?

40:38.799 --> 40:42.166
Operation oral sex is officially over.
Balsbaugh told

40:42.235 --> 40:45.002
Dougie Doug to clean out his
desk once he saw the cuffs and

40:45.071 --> 40:49.273
the bar, and Keppler has left
me 2 messages offering me cash

40:49.342 --> 40:52.877
to burn the video.
You, my dear, are back on duty.

40:52.945 --> 40:56.881
Wow. You know, we should be, uh-- We
should be workin' for, um, TMZ.

40:56.949 --> 40:58.648
Right. Secrets and lies.

40:58.717 --> 41:02.684
Heh heh. Good old-fashioned American way.
How's my kid?

41:02.753 --> 41:06.654
He's good. And he smells good,
which is one of the, uh,

41:06.722 --> 41:09.956
few benefits we're getting
from that aromatherapy class.

41:10.025 --> 41:14.959
Smells like pizza.
Actually, that's me. I-- I smell like

41:15.028 --> 41:18.330
pizza. Hey, uh, Sheel... yes.

41:18.398 --> 41:21.699
Um, you know, I owe you
big time for this.

41:21.768 --> 41:23.902
No. No, I did this for us.

41:23.971 --> 41:25.471
I did this for all of us.

41:25.785 --> 41:26.599
For the brotherhood?

41:26.917 --> 41:29.805
No, silly. For the Gavins.
