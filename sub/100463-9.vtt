01:09.986 --> 01:13.156
Oh, look who's here.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.326
She finally calmed down.
She's been crying since you left.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.827
-Oh, yeah?
-Yes.

01:18.453 --> 01:22.749
-She's acting like she's sleeping.
-Yes!

01:24.375 --> 01:27.420
The genius is out back waiting for you.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.255
"Genius"?

01:29.339 --> 01:30.507
Can I come?

01:30.590 --> 01:33.468
-No, you can't go out there.
- You're staying with me.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.099
Hey!

01:41.643 --> 01:43.353
Working too hard or what?

01:48.691 --> 01:49.651
Look.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.153
What?

01:53.863 --> 01:55.865
Fuck. No seeds.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.784
Told you it was possible.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.369
Told you it was possible!

02:00.745 --> 02:02.914
Fuck, what are we gonna do with this?

02:02.997 --> 02:04.749
Get super fucking high.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.769
<i>It's nice being here.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.564
<i>Reminds me of how things were.</i>

03:53.191 --> 03:55.944
You hated the way things were.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.863
You hated it here.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.325
I did.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.290
Abril's having a recital...

04:10.917 --> 04:12.377
at the school on Tuesday.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.545
You should come.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.631
Really?

04:17.840 --> 04:19.759
You don't mind?

04:21.302 --> 04:23.012
She wants her father to be there.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.224
So I want you to be with her, too.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.980
That's good.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.233
Well, how about this...

04:36.609 --> 04:37.610
I'll go,

04:38.444 --> 04:40.280
but in return,
can you come somewhere with me?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.990
An event for the election in Mexico City.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.618
Don't make this a negotiation.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.121
That's not what I meant.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.290
I already said I'm going.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.293
I'm asking you because...

04:55.962 --> 04:57.797
I want you there with me.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.304
Why'd you come back here?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.598
Tell me the truth.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.934
And don't say it's me.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.608
Someone tried to kill me.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.614
Who?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.534
Juan Nepomuceno Guerra.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.415
I tried to cut a deal with the Gulf.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.546
Tried to outmaneuver the Colombians,
but...

05:39.213 --> 05:42.050
I fucked up, and he outmaneuvered me.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.011
That's why you took on this shipment.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.764
Somehow prove you could still win.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.267
Oh, Miguel...

05:52.894 --> 05:54.729
You're never going to change.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.777
Maybe I will.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.404
Give me a chance?

06:06.574 --> 06:08.493
You know,
I haven't forgotten what I did to you.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.120
Neither have I.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.251
I'm sorry.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.760
So what are you going to do?

06:26.302 --> 06:28.805
This shipment doesn't get through,
there won't be a you.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.352
And if it does?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.897
I'll be on top.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.817
I'm almost there.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.570
Where is "there"?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.364
And what happens when you arrive?

06:51.702 --> 06:54.288
<i>Drug trafficking</i>
<i>works like any other business:</i>

06:54.372 --> 06:56.124
<i>supply and demand.</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:57.917
<i>Supply starts in Colombia,</i>

06:58.000 --> 07:00.253
<i>America's got no shortage of demand,</i>

07:00.753 --> 07:02.672
<i>and Mexico plays the middleman.</i>

07:02.755 --> 07:04.257
<i>That's the model.</i>

07:04.340 --> 07:08.469
<i>And like any other business,</i>
<i>traffickers are always trying to scale up.</i>

07:08.553 --> 07:11.848
<i>Bring as much of the supply to the demand</i>
<i>as you can.</i>

07:12.348 --> 07:14.392
<i>You can move one, why not ten?</i>

07:14.475 --> 07:16.853
<i>Move ten, why not a hundred?</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:20.356
<i>You ain't going up, you're going out.</i>

07:20.982 --> 07:26.362
<i>In 1987, it was estimated that 140 tons</i>
<i>were smuggled into the United States.</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:29.615
<i>Félix was planning on moving half of that</i>
<i>in one night.</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:31.659
<i>Seventy fucking tons.</i>

07:32.243 --> 07:33.828
<i>How's that for scaling up?</i>

07:34.495 --> 07:35.746
<i>Fuck being the middleman.</i>

07:36.330 --> 07:38.458
<i>Félix was about to reshuffle the deck.</i>

07:40.626 --> 07:42.086
<i>Have you heard?</i>

07:44.630 --> 07:45.673
About what?

07:48.593 --> 07:51.762
Félix is about to move 70 tons of cocaine
through Juárez.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.932
How do you know this?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.644
Might be asking the wrong question.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.858
I heard it from a friend.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.944
You didn't.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.030
What do you think that means?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.284
He's back to keeping secrets.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.453
Fucking Juárez.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.289
No. Fucking Félix.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.836
<i>Seventy tons?</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:26.756
A shipment that big?

08:28.299 --> 08:30.176
And he fucking pulls it off...

08:31.552 --> 08:33.679
If this fucker pulls this off,

08:34.764 --> 08:37.683
we're as good as dead.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.687
Then, God willing,
someone puts a bullet in him first.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.946
<i>So anyone Félix had ever wronged,</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
<i>anyone who ever stood in his way...</i>

08:52.490 --> 08:55.576
<i>you've gotta believe</i>
<i>they were rooting against him now.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.037
- What's up?
- Good afternoon.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.872
What's up? Everything's good.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
<i>'Cause if Félix pulled this off,</i>

09:05.836 --> 09:07.296
<i>the past would be that.</i>

09:08.172 --> 09:09.382
<i>Left behind.</i>

09:10.258 --> 09:11.759
<i>Somehow forgotten.</i>

09:13.469 --> 09:15.846
<i>Someone told me you were looking for me.</i>

09:15.930 --> 09:17.765
Yeah. You're still down in Mexico?

09:18.474 --> 09:20.560
I, uh... thought you were coming home.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.063
<i>Soon. It's, uh...</i>
<i>it's complicated.</i>

09:25.147 --> 09:27.441
I'm working on something
really big here, so...

09:27.525 --> 09:30.319
<i>Good, I'm... I'm glad.</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:33.406
<i>Walt, that's... that's good. Listen...</i>

09:34.031 --> 09:36.242
the reason I was calling is, um...

09:38.160 --> 09:39.829
a position opened up.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.623
<i>At the hospital out in Round Rock.</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:45.751
That's great news.
It's a little far, isn't it?

09:47.169 --> 09:48.421
Yeah, uh...

09:48.504 --> 09:49.839
Me and Danny are moving.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.050
You're selling the house?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.345
Yeah.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.599
All right, well, I'd...

10:00.391 --> 10:02.560
really like to come by there,
you know, maybe...

10:03.853 --> 10:06.897
spend some more time in Greg's space
before you let it go.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.108
Well, we sold it, so it'd have to be now.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.321
You're moving quickly. What...

10:14.614 --> 10:16.574
What'd you do with all of Greg's things?

10:16.657 --> 10:17.783
Uh...

10:18.409 --> 10:21.954
I, uh... donated what I could and, um...

10:23.664 --> 10:25.791
you know,
a couple things I'm taking with me.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.254
Listen, I...

10:30.796 --> 10:33.174
I knew hearing this would hurt, Walt.
I'm...

10:34.967 --> 10:36.886
I'm sorry. I don't mean for it to.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.639
<i>But...</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:42.016
<i>we talked about this, right?</i>

10:44.060 --> 10:45.519
I need to move on.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.315
<i>It's time.</i>

10:51.233 --> 10:53.527
It's just gonna be really tough
driving by your place

10:53.611 --> 10:55.655
and not seeing the two of you guys
out front.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.115
<i>Look, Walt, you've been...</i>

10:59.909 --> 11:02.787
You've been torturing yourself
for a long time now.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.375
Maybe it's time that...

11:08.209 --> 11:09.877
<i>you let go of the past too.</i>

11:10.711 --> 11:13.756
I don't want to forget him
and get on with my life

11:13.839 --> 11:16.008
like it doesn't matter that he's gone.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.345
<i>And... nobody will.</i>

11:21.222 --> 11:24.684
Listen, nothing that you do
is gonna make him matter more, Walt.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.271
He already does.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.984
<i>Listen, I should go. I...</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:36.821
Whatever it is
that you're doing down there, I...

11:38.280 --> 11:40.282
I hope you find what you're looking for.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.629
<i>A saying I heard once:</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:55.881
<i>"When you set out on a journey of revenge,</i>

11:56.507 --> 11:57.967
<i>dig two graves."</i>

11:59.093 --> 12:01.470
<i>But if two, why not ten?</i>

12:02.138 --> 12:03.848
<i>If ten, why not a hundred?</i>

12:04.265 --> 12:07.435
<i>Because if the past wasn't going</i>
<i>to catch up to Félix,</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:09.729
<i>then it was time to force its hand.</i>

12:23.409 --> 12:26.620
They're all fucking coming at once,
just like you thought.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.755
We've been over the risks.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.468
But I want to be really clear
on something.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.849
This is no longer the same job
you've been hired for.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.226
We have no support on this.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.854
Shit goes south out there, it's on us.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.647
Believe me,

12:53.731 --> 12:56.275
this ain't worth the shitty stipend
you've been getting paid.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.737
Some of you got kids, families.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.031
Just because you've been helping us
run surveillance

13:02.114 --> 13:04.325
and have known this asshole
your whole life,

13:04.408 --> 13:05.951
doesn't mean you're locked in.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.705
So if any of you are feeling
any hesitation or nervousness,

13:09.789 --> 13:11.248
you need to tell me now.

13:14.585 --> 13:18.255
We do this, we cripple
Félix Gallardo's entire operation?

13:18.881 --> 13:19.882
Yes.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.636
Fuck being nervous.
We'll never get this chance again.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.513
Come on, let's do this shit.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.603
Okay.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.605
Let's fucking cripple it.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.528
Colombians called.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.905
We're set for this afternoon.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.241
Good.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.744
We are ready for tonight.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.625
The other plazas, you think
they've heard about this shipment?

13:55.209 --> 13:57.211
Don't doubt they've heard rumors.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.130
That worries me.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.551
They've been struggling.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.971
And with them helping you
with the election...

14:08.305 --> 14:11.725
If Cárdenas had won,
we'd have all been arrested.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.894
Don't let them fool you, Azul.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.357
They saved themselves
as much as they did me.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.736
Right now, let's focus on Juárez.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.074
You should maybe speak to Amado.

14:28.325 --> 14:32.162
From what Aguliar's said,
the kid seems a little off.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.961
No. He's all about business.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.424
His uncle went down,
and he never said shit.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.219
I hope that you're right.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.765
Hey, Azul.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.811
You got a lot of opinions today, man.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.647
Something else on your mind?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.485
You're gambling with our lives.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.321
Something goes wrong,

15:05.404 --> 15:07.156
it isn't just you.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.199
We all take the fall.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.119
That's right.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.163
You all rose with me.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.666
Without me, everyone is fucked.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.380
But if we survive tonight,

15:24.715 --> 15:26.091
brace yourself.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.427
The future is ours.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.098
Well, I'm rooting for us.

Welcome to Chiapas.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.846
Mr. Carillo Fuentes.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.264
How are you?

16:15.265 --> 16:16.642
Your pizza.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.852
What is this?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.354
I'll need you to sign here.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.565
What, can't take me at my word?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.735
Bullshit bureaucracy.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.493
I've always liked jungles.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.122
Being in touch with nature is nice.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.877
I imagine you made quite a bit of noise,
building this place.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.587
I feel for the animals.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.173
The big ones left when they heard us.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.843
Only the snakes stayed.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.012
Like you.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.809
Which of these saucepans
will be taking me home?

16:59.309 --> 17:00.352
That one.

17:11.447 --> 17:15.826
Someone sends you very special regards.
And a big kiss.

17:15.909 --> 17:16.994
Oh, fuck!

17:17.494 --> 17:21.165
Well, return the kiss
with much love and respect.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.959
Listen...

17:24.460 --> 17:27.588
that coke is prime quality.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.423
So don't go sticking your nose in it.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.551
Good luck on the rest
of your journey, then.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.761
Been a pleasure, Amado.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.400
Your wife's arrived.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.985
Good.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.071
Waiting for you downstairs.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.921
Ready to fly?

18:51.004 --> 18:52.548
Which one of these do you want to take?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.091
None. I'm staying.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.593
Then who's going to fly the last plane?

18:56.677 --> 18:58.554
None of your business, motherfucker.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.986
I'm glad you came.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.740
When someone sends a jet...

19:23.579 --> 19:25.247
You look beautiful.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.461
Not bad for two kids from Sinaloa.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.132
Let's go.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.503
Hey, there you are.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.924
What's up? All good?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.135
Yeah, I guess so.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.346
Just something I can't figure out.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.181
What's that?

20:24.264 --> 20:27.935
Why'd you have me put
the transponder back on that plane?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.237
Wow.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.990
This place is amazing, right?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.743
Where you've always wanted to be.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.372
And here's the man
that made tonight possible.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.582
How are you?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.501
I'm glad you could join us.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.752
Of course.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.128
-You must be María.
-Yes.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.798
You're so cute. Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Cecilia Rosario.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.801
The pleasure is mine.
What a beautiful party.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.344
And we've only just begun.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.637
That's right.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.139
Let me show you to your table.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.849
What a show we're all in for tonight.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.518
You see that gray-haired guy over there?

21:51.601 --> 21:53.520
His name is Hank González.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.188
He made his money in banking.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.651
Fancies airplanes,
has quite an impressive fleet.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.697
Though he'll still try and tell you
his real passion's in teaching.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.824
This way, please.

22:05.907 --> 22:09.202
All right, everybody
be safe out there. I'll be in your ear.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.121
Stay alert, you stay alive.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.927
The person
talking to the president

22:26.011 --> 22:27.971
is the engineer Carlos Slim.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.141
He made a fortune in the stock market.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.561
Known as a champion of the working man.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.731
So, you'd have to ask him
why he sells all his companies

22:37.814 --> 22:39.566
as soon as he can turn a profit.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.610
-And us?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.487
Who are we pretending to be tonight?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.947
Yourselves.

22:46.031 --> 22:47.699
There's no more pretending.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.284
You're friends of the party.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.870
And that's all that really matters.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.497
This way, please.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.461
Plane one is wheels down.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.296
Let's get to work.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.557
<i>I appreciate you all coming tonight.</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:17.354
Squeezing into those beautiful outfits
for us.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.941
For some of you, I know that wasn't easy.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.699
All of you mean a great deal to my family.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.828
We thank you for your support.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.081
The election...

23:37.499 --> 23:41.044
was a little closer than we'd hoped.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.295
But in the end,

23:43.505 --> 23:46.049
democracy has a way
of choosing its own path.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.052
Thanks to all of you, it's chosen ours.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.763
Thank you so much.

24:00.647 --> 24:03.942
I think my brother'd like to say
a few words.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.736
The president.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.501
Plane two is wheels down.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.962
<i>Plane one, what's the status of the cargo?</i>

24:24.504 --> 24:26.465
<i>Almost done unloading.</i>

24:27.507 --> 24:29.259
<i>Well, hurry the fuck up.</i>

24:33.889 --> 24:39.019
I look around this room tonight,
and I see the faces of those responsible,

24:39.603 --> 24:42.397
responsible for our great victory.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.568
<i>And from that victory,</i>

24:46.651 --> 24:49.529
<i>a new world begins.</i>

24:50.906 --> 24:53.283
Affirmative on the product.
Go, guys.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.308
Good evening, asshole.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.571
My friends,
your involvement will be rewarded.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.115
Because together,

25:34.199 --> 25:38.036
we take the first step,
and join those in the first world.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.590
United by the belief

25:50.674 --> 25:54.469
that a change is necessary
for our worlds to grow,

25:55.178 --> 25:57.973
<i>for our economies to align.</i>

26:00.392 --> 26:02.394
Talk to me out there, boys.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.229
How are we looking?

26:06.773 --> 26:10.277
<i>A great change</i>
<i>is on the horizon.</i>

26:11.528 --> 26:14.531
<i>One that will see Mexico stand</i>
<i>as one with Europe</i>

26:14.614 --> 26:16.074
<i>and the Americas.</i>

26:23.039 --> 26:29.004
And those of us sitting here tonight
will be the first to prosper.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.402
<i>As you join me in taking the first step,</i>

26:52.485 --> 26:55.697
<i>guiding Mexico into the 21st century,</i>

26:57.782 --> 26:59.534
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

27:00.035 --> 27:02.787
<i>join me in raising a glass...</i>

27:11.463 --> 27:13.173
<i>as we toast</i>

27:13.757 --> 27:16.885
to the work yet to be done.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.679
To the growth...

27:22.182 --> 27:23.892
<i>prosperity...</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:30.106
and liberation of a new Mexico!

27:30.190 --> 27:32.817
Liberation of a new Mexico!

27:34.110 --> 27:34.986
Move!

27:57.801 --> 27:59.427
What the fuck is this?

28:00.136 --> 28:02.180
On the fucking ground,
right now, all of you!

28:02.263 --> 28:04.224
Don't make me fucking kill you.
Don't move.

28:04.307 --> 28:05.892
I said on the fucking ground!

28:07.227 --> 28:08.728
What the fuck is this?

28:31.376 --> 28:34.462
Jesus. The weight of these things...

28:35.588 --> 28:36.798
Come on. Let's get this done!

28:38.383 --> 28:39.342
Whoo! Yeah!

28:47.267 --> 28:50.019
Fucking thing is too heavy.

28:53.648 --> 28:54.649
Hey, Walt!

28:55.608 --> 28:56.860
This isn't coke!

29:02.657 --> 29:04.909
Take cover! It's an ambush!

29:35.607 --> 29:36.983
You okay, Ossie?

29:37.066 --> 29:38.568
No, we're fucking pinned!

29:42.363 --> 29:43.656
We gotta move!

29:44.449 --> 29:46.159
Fucking go where?

29:46.868 --> 29:48.411
Let's head to the mountain!

29:48.495 --> 29:49.788
We'll never make it!

29:51.456 --> 29:53.249
What the fuck else are we gonna do?

29:57.712 --> 29:59.923
Hey, Walt!  Wait.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.091
The keys are in the truck, right?

30:02.175 --> 30:05.345
- The fuck are you talking about?
-I'm fucking dying, man.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.516
Please, Walt, let me fucking do this.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.730
I can help you make it out.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.899
Get me in the truck.

30:18.858 --> 30:19.859
Please.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.741
Walt, what the fuck are you doing?

30:29.327 --> 30:30.662
Cover me!

31:17.667 --> 31:19.043
- Where's Amat?
- What?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.295
He was right behind you.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.379
Fuck.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.965
Go back to the safe house.
I'll meet you there.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.800
Dude, let's get Amat and go the fuck home.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.177
Hey. Sal, this is on me.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.346
Get the fuck back to the safe house.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.264
Go!

31:32.515 --> 31:33.516
Go!

31:34.309 --> 31:35.351
Fuck.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.651
We got one!

31:43.735 --> 31:44.736
Fuck.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.919
- You guys got one?
-Fucker's still alive.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.521
I never thought
I would be so happy to see you.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.066
Where's Walt?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.992
Man, get me out of here.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.285
Please.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.414
And I swear to God,
I've never seen your face before.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.421
I'm sorry. I can't take that risk.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.426
Holy shit!

32:51.052 --> 32:53.012
He came out of nowhere. He almost got me.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.431
One went that way,
and the other went the other way.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.809
Run. You can still catch them.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.031
You out there, Walt?

33:22.333 --> 33:23.584
There's nowhere to go.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.389
What the fuck did you do?

33:37.682 --> 33:38.975
What you made me.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.064
If you hadn't cut me off,
I could've warned you this would happen.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.818
They found the transponders two days ago.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.570
You walked into a trap.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.447
But you wanted to go your own way.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.825
He deserved to walk away, Walt.
They all did.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.495
But they were never going to.

34:00.621 --> 34:01.831
You made sure of it.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.710
You should've been the one
to die tonight, Walt.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.004
But I'm going to let you live.

34:09.922 --> 34:10.923
Get the fuck out of here

34:11.007 --> 34:13.426
and don't stop walking
until you hear them speak English.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.578
I heard
from the team in Juárez. It's done.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.954
<i>Were there any problems?</i>

34:42.038 --> 34:46.000
None. Nothing we weren't expecting.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.128
<i>I'll fly the real shit in tomorrow.</i>

34:50.088 --> 34:51.089
Good.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.384
Fucking Amado.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.097
You fucking did it.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.891
All right then.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.905
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

35:18.324 --> 35:20.576
Amazing, what you've done.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.080
I hope you realize that.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.289
Yeah.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.792
You survived.

35:27.875 --> 35:30.378
You might be the only one
who thought you would.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.049
I think a few people
may have counted me out,

35:35.133 --> 35:38.010
but I'm only back where I started.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.471
And what have you learned?

35:42.849 --> 35:44.684
It isn't about where you are.

35:47.103 --> 35:49.772
That's been your problem all along.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.440
-Oh, yeah?
-Hmm.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.069
It's what you learn along the way.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.996
Thank you for coming tonight.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.166
Really.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.543
It means a lot to me.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.631
Son of a bitch.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.791
Who else made it out?

36:52.960 --> 36:54.086
Walt.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.507
Who else made it out?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.389
Everyone's gone.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.383
Sorry to keep you gentlemen waiting.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.763
Why don't we get started?

38:29.140 --> 38:31.475
Is Administrator Lawn coming?

38:32.435 --> 38:34.270
I don't believe that he is.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.234
Well, a certain context
for what took place down there, sir,

38:40.318 --> 38:41.986
I think he should be here.

38:43.362 --> 38:47.074
I've read your file.
I'm aware of any context I might need.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.163
So...

38:52.872 --> 38:56.417
a rather unfortunate ending in Mexico,
wouldn't you say?

39:01.255 --> 39:03.716
I think it's easy for you
to sit here in your chair

39:03.799 --> 39:06.218
and make assessments
about the work that I've done.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.889
But I can assure you
that I tried my hardest to...

39:10.973 --> 39:13.267
fulfill the missions
that I was assigned to...

39:13.809 --> 39:15.936
and bring justice to Agent Camarena.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.980
I'm not sure that's true.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.151
The operation you were assigned was
ill-conceived, that's putting it mildly.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.196
But, gentlemen, that operation ended.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.989
Leyenda was over.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.407
And we were told to keep going

39:28.491 --> 39:30.368
and pursue leads
that were provided to us--

39:30.451 --> 39:32.745
As I said, I have the file in front of me.

39:33.621 --> 39:36.415
A thoughtful summary on Leyenda
has been provided,

39:36.499 --> 39:41.379
as well as a letter from this office
regarding its impact on the War on Drugs.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.131
I've passed that letter along
to the White House

39:44.215 --> 39:46.092
at the DOJ's request.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.219
And that is where your file ends.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.847
I'm hoping there's no confusion on that.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.936
So we're just gonna forget
that this ever happened?

39:57.019 --> 39:59.105
And hope to God
everyone else does the same.

39:59.188 --> 40:02.650
Are you gonna fucking weigh in here
and fucking say something?

40:06.028 --> 40:07.530
You went too far, Walt.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.533
Be happy it's ending here.

40:13.994 --> 40:16.997
Some sage advice from Special Agent Heath.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.417
I'd take it to heart.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.296
Your reassignment details
are provided here.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.635
A representative from the office in
Sacramento will be reaching out shortly.

40:30.636 --> 40:33.055
There is no better outcome for you.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.851
Quite frankly, in my opinion,
it's more than you deserve.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.236
So, what about my men?

40:48.946 --> 40:50.990
Do whatever you want to me.
I don't give a fuck.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.616
But we made these men promises,

40:52.700 --> 40:54.577
and we owe it to them to follow through.

40:55.870 --> 41:01.333
A request for sentencing reevaluation
for Amat Palacios's brother.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.545
A work visa for...

41:05.087 --> 41:07.089
Ossie Mejía's uncle.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.175
Cash.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.930
Amat's brother robbed a liquor store
three years ago.

41:15.431 --> 41:20.060
Ossie Mejía was deported ten years ago
under suspicion of grand larceny.

41:21.145 --> 41:23.564
I believe that warrant
is still outstanding.

41:25.232 --> 41:27.610
These men are criminals, Agent Breslin.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.488
This country owes them nothing.

41:34.074 --> 41:36.243
I wouldn't be sitting
in your fucking office right now

41:36.327 --> 41:38.579
if it wasn't for these men
that saved my life.

41:39.079 --> 41:42.875
I'd ask yourself why they were ever
in a position where they needed to.

41:44.793 --> 41:45.878
It's over.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.797
You lost, Agent Breslin.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.730
Guess you knew what you were doing.

42:47.898 --> 42:49.775
Figuring it out.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.529
Get it on the trucks.

42:54.196 --> 42:58.826
The Colombians want it delivered
to a warehouse in Sylmar, California.

43:01.745 --> 43:02.788
Azul.

43:08.168 --> 43:11.297
Seventeen and a half tons to each plaza.

43:12.840 --> 43:17.136
Make sure the Colombians know
how the payments are to be made.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.556
Equal shares?

43:20.639 --> 43:22.766
We're partners, aren't we?

43:24.184 --> 43:27.229
Told you I was still working their end.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.066
We'll see if this'll make 'em happy.

43:32.985 --> 43:34.820
They'll be over the moon.

43:46.790 --> 43:47.875
"Partners"?

43:49.376 --> 43:50.419
Yeah.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.634
Thanks for your help.

43:57.843 --> 44:00.054
I couldn't have done it without you.

44:04.433 --> 44:07.353
This really what you want? Everyone happy?

44:08.979 --> 44:10.022
Well, yeah.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.109
I wasn't sure I could do it.

44:14.902 --> 44:16.528
Maybe the first time in my life.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.531
So what happens next?
