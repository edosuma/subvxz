01:15.242 --> 01:17.535
Incidentally, Emily, I think
the windmill is taking

01:17.536 --> 01:18.995
too much time
for the tour, so...

01:18.996 --> 01:20.496
Steven, the windmill is fine.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.706
No, no, I like the windmill--

01:21.707 --> 01:22.915
Can we talk about it tomorrow?

01:23.417 --> 01:27.545
Emily, this is important.
Why are you avoiding me?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.590
David, how can I avoid you?
We work in the same place.

He was very cruel.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.514
I know that you're at
a disadvantage.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.394
And I realize,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.479
it's not gonna be easy for you
to give us a description.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.191
To describe what he did.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.318

nervous.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.116
Would you like to try
and write it down?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.201
Might be easier.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.167
He's gonna be real hard
to catch, you know.

to happen to anyone else.

So what I really need here is...

13:02.031 --> 13:03.615
you know,
just some small detail.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.078

13:14.085 --> 13:17.963
or his face.
Whenever you can.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.183
You can call that number there,
or you can just stop by.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.737
[Andrea] It's me.

25:36.744 --> 25:40.205
-Andrea, hi.
-Hi, I called you last night.

25:41.040 --> 25:41.998
Are you alright?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.293
-I'm moving.
-Oh.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.714
-Where?
-Across the river.

25:50.841 --> 25:54.469
Have a doorman...
clean paint... view.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.931
Shouldn't you think this out?

25:58.557 --> 26:01.976
I have...
Can't live here anymore.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.854
I can't, I can't!

26:05.773 --> 26:07.232
Besides, I signed a lease.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.236
[Andrea] Have you told Steven
what happened?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.030
[Emily] What for?

26:15.282 --> 26:17.909
Seems I... seems I don't
choose men very well.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.285
[Andrea] No, huh.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.455
What does the Shrink
have to say?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.250
[Emily] Marin? He says,

26:25.251 --> 26:27.252
"Hmm, what do you think."
A lot of that.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.048
I was never very comfortable
with Dr. Marin anyway,

26:32.049 --> 26:34.551
and besides it doesn't matter
from here on in,

26:34.552 --> 26:35.677
my money goes for rent.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.014
Money? I can lend you
all the money that you need.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.642
Oh, thanks. No.

27:00.911 --> 27:01.869
[knock on door]

27:03.330 --> 27:04.163
Who is it?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.582
[knock on door]

27:10.004 --> 27:11.754
-[Emily] Hello?
-[knock on door]

27:12.506 --> 27:13.756
Oh Jesus, listen--

27:13.924 --> 27:16.384
-[man yells]
-[Emily screams]

27:16.844 --> 27:18.469
[man] Sweetheart.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.349
[screams]

[man grunts]

27:51.545 --> 27:52.795
[Emily gasping]

28:10.397 --> 28:13.149
[Andrea]
It's okay, it's okay.

28:15.361 --> 28:19.280
He's gone, he's gone. Okay?

28:34.380 --> 28:35.338
[car door closing]

28:39.802 --> 28:41.844
[chatter on police radio]

28:41.845 --> 28:44.180
[policeman] Bob,
there is a young lady

28:44.181 --> 28:46.265
down here to see you,
a Miss...

28:46.600 --> 28:47.767
[Emily] Hollander, Emily.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.268
[policeman]
Emily Hollander.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.732
Take the stairs, one flight up,
first door on your left.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.212
[distant chatter]

29:29.184 --> 29:30.059
Emily?

29:32.521 --> 29:34.105
I'm sorry,
I should've left the door open.

29:35.733 --> 29:36.774
Come on in.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.622
Would you like to have a seat?

30:02.509 --> 30:03.968
[Jim]
I'll be with Persky, Bob.

30:07.431 --> 30:08.389
[door closing]

30:17.316 --> 30:18.441
He came back.

30:19.777 --> 30:20.735
When?

30:20.944 --> 30:21.819
[Emily sighs]

30:22.321 --> 30:24.447
This morning.
He tried to break in,

30:24.448 --> 30:25.740
but Andrea stopped him.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.873
And the other night?

30:46.303 --> 30:47.261
He had a...

30:50.349 --> 30:51.516
He had a knife.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.771
He kept putting it at my throat,

30:57.481 --> 31:00.316
and... my mouth.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.071
I couldn't breathe and I...

31:08.951 --> 31:11.619
He tore open my coat...

31:16.959 --> 31:20.294
Made me pull... my bra down.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.300
He had a tape recorder and...

31:28.220 --> 31:29.637
I had to make sounds.

31:33.642 --> 31:34.600
It was awful.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.062
He scared the hell out of me.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.109
Did you see his face?

31:44.653 --> 31:45.611
[sighs]

31:49.658 --> 31:52.034
Today I... real quick and...

31:55.789 --> 31:57.164
Well, he was a creep.

32:05.716 --> 32:09.594
Look, how about
if I give you a ride home?

32:11.179 --> 32:12.138
Oh, no, no.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.099
It's not necessary.
[stammering]

32:16.310 --> 32:18.185
I can take a cab,
I really like cabs.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.189
[telephone buzzing]

32:26.194 --> 32:27.695
-Yeah?
-[man] That you, Jim?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.822
-No, It's Luffrono.
-Where's Jim?

32:29.990 --> 32:31.240
He's next door with Person.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.199
-Bye.
-Bye.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.462
-[phone dialing]
-Jackie, it's Luffrono.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.131
Look, there's an Emily Hollander
coming by the desk.

32:47.925 --> 32:49.717
-Flag her a cab, will you?
-[Jackie] Sure.

33:13.992 --> 33:14.951
[doorman] Hollander?

33:17.204 --> 33:18.496
We put your stuff upstairs.

33:19.998 --> 33:20.957
My stuff?

33:21.375 --> 33:24.835
A girl. A girl in a sports car,
made two trips.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.963
Thank... thank you.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.756
[doorman] She has the cat.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.010
Thanks.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.515
[door lock opens]

33:58.120 --> 33:59.245
[Andrea] Mmm.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.957
You haven't touched your drink.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.918
[Emily I'm...
I'm not much of a drinker.

34:07.254 --> 34:11.132
Well, a toast to...

34:13.467 --> 34:17.763
To good friends.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.311
This is such a beautiful room.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.567
Stay awhile, have dinner.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.822
Oh, Andrea I...
No, I can't.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.282
I really... I have to go.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.119
But I'd love to have lunch
with you this week.

34:41.663 --> 34:42.621
Absolutely.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.460
Umm, where is Jenny anyway?

34:50.464 --> 34:51.422
She's around.

34:52.549 --> 34:56.052
By the way,
what happened with the police?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.637
[sighs]
Well, they were very nice.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.265
-Really?
-Mhmm.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.685
But they don't know
who did it, of course.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.020
No, not yet.

35:06.772 --> 35:07.730
Jenny.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.192
Jenny, time to go home.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.818
[Andrea]
Are you sure you won't stay?

35:13.028 --> 35:14.945
No, I can't, really.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.489
-Jenny!
-[cat meowing]

35:17.324 --> 35:18.532
There she is.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.076
Let me.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.831
-[cat hisses]
-[Andrea] Damn!

35:25.832 --> 35:27.541
Jenny. Jenny.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.543
Oh, the house is new to her.
She...

35:29.795 --> 35:31.754
You didn't mean
to hurt Andrea, did you?

35:32.464 --> 35:33.422
[Andrea] Doesn't matter.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.721
-Here.
-I'm sorry about the scratch.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.141
Forget it.
How're you getting home?

35:44.434 --> 35:45.518
Taxi.

35:45.519 --> 35:46.852
[Andrea]
Uh-uh. I'll drive you.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.563
I insist.

35:57.364 --> 35:58.447
[cat meowing]

36:09.000 --> 36:10.209
How long have you been here?

36:11.795 --> 36:13.003
Oh, couple of minutes.

36:24.349 --> 36:28.018
You, uh, you did
a little disappearing act.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.067
How did you find me?

36:36.361 --> 36:37.611
That's a trade secret.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.156
You called "Missing Persons."

36:47.873 --> 36:48.914
It's a terrific view.

36:50.834 --> 36:55.004
[laughs] This is official.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.131
Oh, there's this little bakery.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.217
Well, actually,
it's a restaurant too,

37:01.261 --> 37:04.096
and once a week, I, uh...
I drive over the bridge and I...

37:05.056 --> 37:06.807
I get these little cakes
they make.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.143
[gentle music playing]

37:09.603 --> 37:11.645
So I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.648
Thank... thank you.

37:22.407 --> 37:26.076
You know the restaurant bar...
It's terrific.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.289
I'll have to try it sometime.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.124
Would you like
to get a bite tonight?

37:34.753 --> 37:37.671
I, um... I can't. I'm sorry

37:39.633 --> 37:42.426
Anyway, this place, you know,
it's gonna look great...

37:43.428 --> 37:44.595
when you fix it up.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.144
I better get going.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.190
Thanks for stopping by.
Um...

37:58.568 --> 38:00.694
-Bob.
-Bob.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.363
I'll be in touch.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.536
You can let the cat
out of the bag now.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.080
Oh...

38:11.790 --> 38:12.748
Bye.

38:37.107 --> 38:39.400
-Taxi!
-[hurried footsteps]

38:40.360 --> 38:41.443
Aren't you out early?

38:41.444 --> 38:42.486
-God, no.
-[car honks]

38:42.487 --> 38:44.238
-Gonna have a cup of coffee--
-I've gotta run.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.698
I'm through with Dr. Marin.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.533
I'll call you later.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.422
Great day, isn't it, Larry?

39:01.631 --> 39:04.591
[Lawrence]
Lawrence... where to?

39:04.759 --> 39:08.971
Um, Brooklyn Children's Museum
at the 80th Street entrance.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.848
-Okay?
-[Lawrence] Yeah.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.399
[Dr. Marin] Andrea,
how are you this morning?

39:24.070 --> 39:25.904
-Andrea.
-[Andrea] What?

39:29.993 --> 39:32.369
[Dr. Marin] Troubling you?
I mean, something right now?

39:36.499 --> 39:37.458
[Andrea] No.

39:39.586 --> 39:40.544
Nothing.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.630
[Dr. Marin]
You seem preoccupied.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.092
[Andrea exhales]

39:51.556 --> 39:53.140
[Andrea]
And you want to know why.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.020
If you wish to tell me.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.444
[Andrea]
I'm working on a poem.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.822
It's a new one.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.910
Would you like to hear about it?

40:14.537 --> 40:15.496
Alright.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.084
It's about love.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.549
You know, Larry,
it's all in your attitude.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.134
[Lawrence]
That's bullshit.

40:29.969 --> 40:30.928
Are you crazy?

40:31.679 --> 40:33.597
What do you know
about driving a cab?

40:39.479 --> 40:41.438
Speak up, I can't hear you.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.739
[suspenseful music playing]

41:06.464 --> 41:07.423
Listen, Larry...

41:09.592 --> 41:11.093
Stop at the corner. I...

41:12.429 --> 41:13.595
I wanna call someone.

41:14.431 --> 41:15.639
Flag stays down.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.225
I... I don't mind.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.144
That's bullshit.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.521
Bullshit.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.536
[suspenseful music continues]

41:49.757 --> 41:52.092
[suspenseful music builds]

42:38.264 --> 42:40.974
Forgot I had to meet a friend.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.186
[ominous music playing]

42:57.033 --> 43:00.327
[Lawrence] Hey, you live in
Brooklyn Heights?

43:01.329 --> 43:02.287
No.

43:03.957 --> 43:05.624
I think I've seen you before.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.876
I don't think so, Larry.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.753
Why do you keep
calling me Larry?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.296
Lawrence is my name.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.757
Larry is bullshit.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.177
Sorry, Lawrence.

43:18.513 --> 43:19.471
[Lawrence] I bet.

43:28.982 --> 43:30.941
I'm sure I've seen you before.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.193
[stutters]
Just pull over here, Lawrence.

-Hey!
-[gun clicks]

43:38.116 --> 43:39.491
Alright, shit-face,
out of the cab.

43:39.659 --> 43:40.617
What did I do?

43:40.785 --> 43:42.661
-[policeman] Get out of the cab.
-[Lawrence] What did I do?

43:42.662 --> 43:44.246
-[Bob] You scumbag!
-[policeman] Get over there!

43:44.247 --> 43:45.539
[Lawrence]
Hey, what's going on?

43:45.540 --> 43:46.957
[Bob] Aw, come on!

43:46.958 --> 43:48.500
You got the right
to remain silent.

43:48.501 --> 43:49.585
[Lawrence] Crazy!

43:49.586 --> 43:51.086
[clamoring]

43:51.254 --> 43:52.879
-[policeman] Get him up!
-[Lawrence] Are you crazy?

44:50.855 --> 44:53.106
-[phone ringing]
-[typing]

45:01.532 --> 45:05.369
Bobby, just got a call about
that cab driver, Obecny.

45:05.787 --> 45:06.870
[Bob] Yeah?

45:06.871 --> 45:07.996
He's got a partner.

45:09.916 --> 45:11.041
[Bob] He's got a partner?

45:12.418 --> 45:13.669
-What do you mean?
-[phone ringing]

45:13.878 --> 45:16.004
He said someone paid him
to assault Emily Hollander.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.841
Oh who, for Christ's sake?

45:20.176 --> 45:21.885
He won't say unless
the charges are dropped.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.429
Could be bullshit.

45:26.516 --> 45:28.058
-I'll see you tomorrow, Jimmy.
-Okay.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.609
[car horns honking]

46:05.346 --> 46:06.847
[Bob]
There are questions about sex.

46:08.349 --> 46:10.767
In these kinds of cases,
I have seen Defense Attorneys

46:10.768 --> 46:12.227
tear up witnesses all the time.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.022
I suppose it never occurred
to you that I might...

46:16.566 --> 46:19.359
help by handling myself well
in the witness stand.

46:21.904 --> 46:24.573
Well, I didn't mean
you couldn't handle yourself.

46:25.491 --> 46:27.117
I know what you mean, Luffrono.

46:32.832 --> 46:33.915
You got it wrong.

46:35.418 --> 46:36.460
Absolutely wrong.

46:41.924 --> 46:42.883
Emily?

46:46.179 --> 46:47.095
You okay?

46:49.891 --> 46:52.100
You're the detective,
you figure me out.

46:52.894 --> 46:53.852
[Bob] I'll try.

47:01.611 --> 47:28.804
[ship horn honking]

47:43.694 --> 47:45.237
May I sometimes come here?

47:46.531 --> 47:49.491
Whenever you like,
it's your home too.

47:50.618 --> 47:52.202
There are people here
who love you.

47:52.954 --> 47:54.788
[man on TV]
Look at you and Tina,

47:54.997 --> 47:57.332
share with you peace,
contentment.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.292
[woman on TV] Of course.

47:59.293 --> 48:01.795
And just think it won't be
for this time only.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.923
That is, if you will help me
keep what we have.

48:06.801 --> 48:08.552
If we both try hard to...

48:09.470 --> 48:12.514
to protect that little
strip of territory that's ours.

48:14.392 --> 48:17.143
-We can talk about your child...
-[man on TV] Our child.

48:19.772 --> 48:20.730
Thank you.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.817
And will you be happy,
Charlotte?

48:25.319 --> 48:27.320
Oh Jerry,
don’t let’s ask for the moon.

48:28.531 --> 48:29.698
We have the stars.

48:31.868 --> 48:34.452
[romantic music

48:42.378 --> 48:43.795
[crying]

48:46.257 --> 48:47.215
[sighs]

48:47.675 --> 48:50.260
I'm proud of myself,
I only cried once.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.433
[Bob]
I really love old movies.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.644
[jazz music playing on TV]

49:03.524 --> 49:05.734
I haven't gotten
my curtains up yet.

49:05.735 --> 49:07.694
[man on TV] You've just seen
Now, Voyager...

49:07.695 --> 49:09.821
starring Bette Davis
and Paul Henreid.

49:10.406 --> 49:12.365
Don't miss
the special weekly broadcast...

49:15.703 --> 49:16.578
[TV turns off]

49:25.504 --> 49:29.007
I... hope you enjoyed
the chicken.

49:33.387 --> 49:34.804
Oh, the chicken was terrific.

49:40.353 --> 49:41.311
You have to go?

49:43.356 --> 49:44.898
Yeah, I have to go.

50:03.292 --> 50:06.419
-I have to get my other coat.
-Oh, sure.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.851
[Bob I'll give you a call.

50:24.939 --> 50:25.897
Will you?

50:26.816 --> 50:27.774
[Bob] Mhmm.

50:37.201 --> 50:38.159
Good night.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.495
[Bob] Good night.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.330
Good night.

50:51.215 --> 50:52.173
[sighs]

50:55.094 --> 50:56.553
You should keep
your door locked.

50:59.140 --> 51:01.182
[slow music playing]

51:24.165 --> 51:27.167
[breathing heavily]

51:37.303 --> 51:39.095
[Dr. Marin] Andrea,
it’s very important

51:39.096 --> 51:41.181
that you make
a clear distinction

51:41.182 --> 51:43.975
between what should happen
and what is truly happening.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.772
Now is this in reference
to one of your poems?

51:51.817 --> 51:53.109
Does it make a difference?

51:55.488 --> 51:56.821
Don't you think it does?

52:00.326 --> 52:01.284
No.

52:02.661 --> 52:04.621
Is something actually happening?

52:10.086 --> 52:11.044
Yes.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.883
What is this something
you wished to have happened?

52:18.385 --> 52:19.844
I know what I want.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.389
[Dr. Marin]
You mean in a poetic sense.

52:26.393 --> 52:27.769
And I know how to get it.

52:31.023 --> 52:32.482
Have you said how you feel?

52:35.486 --> 52:36.611
I will. I...

52:39.782 --> 52:40.740
Maybe I...

52:45.079 --> 52:46.996
I can't yet, but I will.

52:48.332 --> 52:49.624
[Dr. Marin]
You're certain you will?

52:50.167 --> 52:51.042
Yes!

52:53.129 --> 52:54.170
Yes.

52:55.798 --> 52:57.340
Why do you insist that I won't?

53:03.722 --> 53:05.098
[Emily] The dinner was great.

53:05.933 --> 53:07.308
[Bob] Yeah, I liked it a lot.

53:08.435 --> 53:09.978
You still wanna
walk over the bridge?

53:11.856 --> 53:13.064
[Emily] It's so beautiful.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.358
[Bob] Yeah, it sure is.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.986
[Emily] I bet you can see
my apartment from up there.

53:21.323 --> 53:22.991
[man on recording]
Open your mouth...

53:26.287 --> 53:28.204
Say, "Ah."

53:28.497 --> 53:30.081
[Emily on recording
breathing heavily]

53:30.374 --> 53:32.417
[man] Say, "Ah."

53:33.836 --> 53:35.003
[Emily] Ah.

53:35.921 --> 53:37.422
[man] Ah...

53:40.634 --> 53:42.343
[Emily] Ah.

53:48.601 --> 53:52.061
[man] You move, I cut.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.651
Now say, "Ah."

53:59.403 --> 54:00.862
[Emily] Ah...

54:04.283 --> 54:06.409
[Emily] Oh yes, ah.

54:06.744 --> 54:09.704
[ship horn honks]

54:26.222 --> 54:27.680
I'm all out of coffee.

54:29.308 --> 54:30.808
[Bob] It... doesn't matter.

54:32.853 --> 54:33.811
Uh...

54:34.438 --> 54:35.396
Look, Bob...

54:36.941 --> 54:38.066
I don't feel very well.

54:38.859 --> 54:39.984
What's the problem?

54:40.611 --> 54:44.364
[Emily] I don't know I...
I have a slight fever...

54:46.367 --> 54:47.575
headache and...

54:48.410 --> 54:49.827
I'm coming down
with something.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.331
Touch of the bridge.

54:54.375 --> 54:55.333
Yeah.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.169
We better make an early evening.

55:00.256 --> 55:01.214
You think?

55:41.588 --> 55:45.591
[phone buttons beeping]

55:47.803 --> 55:53.433
[phone ringing]

55:57.563 --> 55:58.521
[Emily] Hello.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.483
Hello?

56:06.113 --> 56:07.155
Who is it?

56:09.158 --> 56:10.116
Hello?

56:12.745 --> 56:14.912
I think someone...

56:15.581 --> 56:17.206
[Andrea whispering]
You son of a bitch.

56:19.918 --> 56:21.210
Don't touch her.

56:29.678 --> 56:30.928
[Emily] Who was it?

56:32.348 --> 56:33.514
[Bob] Oh, it's nobody.

56:55.371 --> 56:56.954
[Andrea coughing]

56:57.831 --> 56:59.582
[solemn music playing]

57:05.506 --> 57:07.090
Today's a complete
waste of time.

57:14.681 --> 57:15.640
Sorry.

57:17.976 --> 57:19.394
It's your time, not mine.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.188
This is of no help
to you at all.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.612
I don't know why
you make me come here.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.074
I don't wanna talk to you.

57:33.784 --> 57:34.784
Why did you get drunk?

57:36.703 --> 57:37.745
[sighs]

57:40.249 --> 57:41.499
Because it hurts.

57:49.258 --> 57:50.925
Do you understand
anything at all?

"It was winter with love tide.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.271
-Luffrono.
-[Emily] Bob?

58:46.064 --> 58:48.149
I knew it was you,
I was just thinking about you.

58:49.318 --> 58:50.860
Did you get those drapes up yet?

58:51.653 --> 58:56.073
Bob, my neighbor Ida Marx,
her husband is missing.

58:56.325 --> 58:57.783
Well, how long has he been gone?

58:58.076 --> 58:59.243
About 2 hours.

58:59.578 --> 59:00.870
Well, do you know where he went?

59:01.288 --> 59:02.914
-Well--
-[phone ringing]

59:03.332 --> 59:05.875
[Emily] Sam and Ida thought they
heard noises in my apartment.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.043
Probably Jenny.

59:08.629 --> 59:10.087
So Sam went in to check.

59:11.256 --> 59:12.215
[Bob] And?

59:13.884 --> 59:14.926
He never came back.

59:15.969 --> 59:17.386
[Ida] It's not unusual.

59:18.138 --> 59:20.181
-Where are you now?
-In my apartment.

59:20.641 --> 59:21.933
Is everything in place?

59:23.560 --> 59:24.977
[Emily]
Yes, but I can’t find Jenny.

59:25.646 --> 59:27.355
Oh, she just probably
slipped out.

59:28.857 --> 59:29.815
Maybe so.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.736
Look, I'll come over
as soon as I can.

59:34.863 --> 59:36.280
-Okay?
-Okay.

59:36.698 --> 59:37.657
Bye.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.087
[Emily]
Ida, why don't you sit down?

59:51.088 --> 59:52.296
I'll fix you some tea.

59:52.673 --> 59:55.007
No, I'm looking
for those little bottles

59:55.008 --> 59:57.301
that they gave us
on the flight from Miami.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:01.973
You know, once he went
to Philadelphia, just like that.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.308
His brother lives in Philly.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.853
That time,
he was gone for 13 days.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.440
So, what's two hours
and 20 minutes, huh?

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.613
Won't you go in the kitchen
and see if there’s some ice?

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.589
[crash]

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:55.818
Sam's gonna kill me
for getting sick.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.239
Break the news to him gentle.
Huh?

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.074
I'm so sorry, Ida.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.202
Don't be sorry.

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:09.165
Tell him to call me
at the hospital.

[car horns honking]

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:09.141
[Dr. Marin] I think
it would be advisable

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.476
at this point, Andrea,

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:13.521
for you to think this out
in a safe environment.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.233
In a hospital atmosphere.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.571
I made arrangements for you
to be admitted this evening.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.243
I'll go with you and...

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.163
We can have a short session
when you get settled.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.043
Of course, we'll...
we'll get a second opinion.

01:02:39.172 --> 01:02:40.297
But for now...

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.217
for your own piece of mind...

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.846
I think we should go ahead.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:51.809
Andrea.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.614
[chatter on police radio]

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.876
[Bob] You better check
all the refrigerators,

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:21.589
stoves, any trunks, you know.

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:24.008
And rest of the junk down here.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:25.468
What, another stiff?

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:26.969
[Bob] No.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.221
What the hell am I looking for?

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:32.808
An orange cat.

[woman] Come on kids, move.

01:03:57.793 --> 01:03:59.043
Emily, it's Sam Marx.

found the body.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.464
-I have to call Ida.
-Wait.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.008
Look, I want you to stay home.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.093
And don't let anyone in.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:10.387
Jimmy.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:14.433
I've got work to do.
I'll be back. Okay?

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.771
Take her upstairs.
I'll see you back at the car.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:19.730
Okay.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.069
Nick.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.242
I want the names of anyone
with a Brooklyn Heights address,

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:33.285
who bought a telescope
in the last eight or nine days.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.455
A biggie. Expensive one.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:39.041
I want it tonight.

01:04:39.835 --> 01:04:41.585
Luffrono, the stores
will be closed soon.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.588
-Tonight, Nick.
-Alright.

01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:58.477
[Andrea]
Have a drink if you like.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.604
[Dr. Marin]
No, no, no, thank you.

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:03.899
It's not necessary.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.912
I'm glad you understand
about the hospital.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.582
[Andrea]
Of course, I understand.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:21.750
I'm pleased.

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:30.092
We're not talking about
a long time, you realize that.

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:34.471
[Andrea] How long?

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:37.433
[Dr. Marin]
Difficult to say at the moment.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.357
How long do you think?

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:55.409
Andrea?

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:00.915
Where are you?

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:02.875
I'm right here.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:07.546
Yes. I'm,
I'm still trying to find a...

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.424
patient by the name of Ida Marx.

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:14.470

[engine revving]

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:31.028
[stammering] Operator,
I've been waiting

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:32.237
for five minutes.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.365
[operator]
I just don't have a Mrs. Marx.

01:06:34.366 --> 01:06:35.741
Are you sure she was admitted?

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:40.454

Yeah, she did.
Just before you came in.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.439
-She took a cab.
-What kind of cab?

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:18.732
It was a checker.

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:21.735
She didn't happen to mention
where she was going, did she?

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.946
No. But he made
an uptown U-turn.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.368
It was a terrible thing, what
happened to Mr. Marx, huh?

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:30.786
Yeah.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:45.884

01:13:45.505 --> 01:13:46.421
What's wrong?

01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:02.020
[stammering] I... have...

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:04.648
[Andrea] Have to go?

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.287
[Mr. Hollander] Hello.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.206
-Hello, Mr. Hollander.

01:14:24.836 --> 01:14:26.670
[Mr. Hollander] Uh,
I'm not sure, I understand.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.172
We're trying to contact
Emily Hollander.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.382
She's not at home.

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.800
We thought you might know
where she is.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.970
[Mr. Hollander] No, no.
She's seeing someone, you know.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.305
I don’t know who,
but she’s with him I imagine.

01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.350
What's wrong?
Has she done something?

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:42.936
No. Nothing at all. Thank you.

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:46.106

[whispering]
I don't look all the time.

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.266

01:15:35.907 --> 01:15:37.407

01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.205
I'm glad you know.

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:47.167
I don't want it to be a secret.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.589

You almost never do.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.327
I've seen you laugh.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:08.999

Yes, I could love you.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:32.517
Don't lie to me.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:46.156

Why are you running away?

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.204
You said you could love me.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.668
[Andrea breathes heavily]

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.338
Sure, you can.

01:27:41.215 --> 01:27:42.381
[Emily cries]

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:43.507
And you better.

01:27:46.595 --> 01:27:52.350
Pull it down.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:09.408
No... no... no.

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:28.427
Open your mouth...

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.891
say, "Ah."

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.144
[exhales]

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:42.400
[Andrea moaning]

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:48.698
Stop it... please.

01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:56.247
Please, please,
oh, please, please.

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.631
[shuddered breathing]

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:10.052
Ah...
[moaning]

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.477
[moaning]
Please!

01:29:22.316 --> 01:29:23.524
Stop it.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:26.027
-[slap]
-[Andrea grunts]

01:29:56.641 --> 01:30:13.324
Please, don't hurt me.

01:30:18.372 --> 01:30:20.831
[quiet music playing]

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:27.296
Don't hurt me.

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:34.303
-Please, please don't hurt me.
-[chatter on police radio]

01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:37.890
Please, don't hurt me.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:44.146
[chatter on police radio]

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.153
[Bob] You know, you shouldn't
have left the apartment.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:57.201
The last thing I said to you
was to stay home, I'll be back.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.120
I know.

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:02.873
You were lucky, you know that?

01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:06.085
She never would've done
anything to me.

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:09.213
Yes, she would've.

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:15.136
Come on.

01:31:16.138 --> 01:31:19.640
Luffrono, let's walk.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.725
I'd like to walk.

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.228
Emily.

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.231
I feel fine.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:32.027
I feel very good.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:35.739
She said she loved me.

01:31:36.032 --> 01:31:38.409
She kept telling me all night
that she loved me.

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:41.704
[Bob] Yeah, well,
in her own way, she...

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:43.414
she probably did.

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:48.752
Say, are you still
out of coffee?

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.088
[Emily laughs]

01:31:51.298 --> 01:31:52.465
[Emily] I never was.

01:31:57.762 --> 01:32:00.473
