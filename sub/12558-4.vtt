I SIMPLY FOLLOWED YOUR TEARS,
MR. VOLLMER.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.247
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.537
I DO, I DO INDEED.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.162
I HAVE YOU TO TALK ABOUT,
AND THE THINGS YOU BELIEVE IN,

15:20.253 --> 15:22.995
WHICH ARE THE THINGS
/BELIEVE IN, AS WELL.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.673
YOUR SUCCESS, MR. VOLLMER,
WILL BE MYSUCCESS.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.375
GO ON.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.925
GOOD.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.595
LET US START BY YOUR LEARNING

15:32.640 --> 15:36.474
WHAT ARE THE DYNAMICS
OF A CROWD.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.053
HOW DO YOU MOVE A MOB,
MR. VOLLMER?

15:39.147 --> 15:40.854
HOW DO YOU EXCITE THEM?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.272
HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM FEEL
AS ONE WITH YOU?

15:43.359 --> 15:46.477
L-| DON'T KNOW. HOW?

15:46.571 --> 15:48.187
JOIN THEM FIRST, MR. VOLLMER.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.521
JOIN THEM?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.323
YES, WHEN YOU SPEAK TO THEM,

15:52.410 --> 15:55.493
SPEAK TO THEM AS IF YOU
WERE A MEMBER OF THE MOB.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.074
SPEAK TO THEM IN THEIR LANGUAGE,
ON THEIR LEVEL.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.159
<i>MAKE THEIR HATE YOUR HATE.</i>

16:02.253 --> 16:06.713
IF THEY ARE POOR,
TALK TO THEM OF POVERTY.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.508
IF THEY ARE AFRAID,
TALK TO THEM OF THEIR FEARS.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.882
AND IF THEY ARE ANGRY,
MR. VOLLMER,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.883
IF THEY ARE ANGRY,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.261
GIVE THEM OBJECTS
FOR THEIR ANGER.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.308
BUT MOST OF ALL,

16:19.395 --> 16:22.513
THE THING THAT IS MOST
OF THE ESSENCE, MR. VOLLMER,

16:22.607 --> 16:26.396
IS THAT YOU MAKE THIS MOB
AN EXTENSION OF YOURSELF.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.104
SAY TO THEM THINGS LIKE...

16:30.198 --> 16:33.111
THINGS LIKE...

16:33.201 --> 16:35.533
"THEY CALL US HATEMONGERS.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.112
"THEY SAY WE'RE PREJUDICED.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.867
"THEY SAY WE'RE BIASED.

16:39.957 --> 16:44.747
"THEY SAY WE HATE
MINORITIES-- MINORITIES.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.329
"UNDERSTAND
THE TERM, NEIGHBORS:

16:47.423 --> 16:50.006
"MINORITIES.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.335
"SHOULD I TELL YOU
WHO ARE THE MINORITIES?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.340
"SHOULD I TELL YOU?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.933
IIWE__,!

16:57.016 --> 16:59.303
WE ARE THE MINORITIES!"

17:01.229 --> 17:04.142
THAT WAY, MR. VOLLMER.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.314
START IT THAT WAY.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.566
I... UNDERSTAND.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.818
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.652

<i>[more confidently]: N E I G H B O <i>RS.</i></i>

17:27.255 --> 17:28.871
HATEMONGERS.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.046
THEY SAY...

17:33.135 --> 17:34.842
<i>[even more confidently]:
WE'RE PREJUDICED.</i>

17:36.597 --> 17:39.464
THEY SAY...

17:39.559 --> 17:41.971
<i>WE'RE BIASED!</i>

17:42.061 --> 17:47.306
THEY SAY
THAT WE HATE THE MINORITIES!

17:47.400 --> 17:49.892
THE MINORITIES.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.195
UNDERSTAND THE TERM, NEIGHBORS.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.148
THE MINORITIES.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.611
SHALL I TELL YOU
WHO THE MINORITIES ARE?!

18:00.705 --> 18:02.616
WE, WE, WE...!

18:02.707 --> 18:05.290
WE ARE THE MINORITIES!

18:05.376 --> 18:10.416
BECAUSE PATRIOTISM...

18:10.506 --> 18:12.838
IS A MINORITY.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.633
BECAUSE LOVE OF COUNTRY...

18:15.720 --> 18:18.087
IS THE MINORITY.

18:18.180 --> 18:22.845
BECAUSE TO LIVE
IN A FREE, WHITE AMERICA

18:22.935 --> 18:26.553
SEEMS TO BE
OF A MINORITY OPINION!

18:26.647 --> 18:30.436
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
NEIGHBORS.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.437
I WANT YOU TO DWELL ON THIS,

18:32.528 --> 18:35.441
JUST DWELL ON IT.

18:35.531 --> 18:40.446
WE HAD THE ATOM BOMB,

18:40.536 --> 18:43.528
AND SUDDENLY...

18:43.623 --> 18:46.240
THE RUSSIANS HAD IT.

18:46.334 --> 18:51.454
WE WANTED
TO SEND MEN INTO SPACE!

18:51.547 --> 18:57.168
BUT IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
WHO GOT THERE FIRST!

18:57.261 --> 18:59.753
WE HAD THE HYDROGEN BOMB!

19:02.975 --> 19:08.266
IT WAS THE RUSSIANS
WHO EXPLODED THEIRS.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.690
WHO GAVE THEM THE BOMBS?

19:11.776 --> 19:16.145
WHO SOLD US OUT?
WHO STABBED US IN THE BACK?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.900
WELL...

19:18.991 --> 19:21.699
IF IT'S A MINORITY OPINION

19:21.786 --> 19:25.074
THAT WE HAVE TO SURVIVE,

19:25.164 --> 19:29.123
THEN WE ARE THE MINORITY.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.747
AND THIS MINORITY

19:31.837 --> 19:33.703
WILL NOT STOP

19:33.798 --> 19:37.041
UNTIL IT IS THE MAJORITY!

19:37.134 --> 19:41.503
THIS MINORITY
WILL NOT GIVE UP THE FIGHT!

19:41.597 --> 19:44.931
THIS... IS THE PROMISE

19:45.017 --> 19:48.100
AND THIS, THIS IS THE LEGACY!

19:48.187 --> 19:53.182
<i>[applause and cheers]</i>

19:58.406 --> 20:01.239

20:05.413 --> 20:09.748
PAL, WE'RE IN THERE NOW, HUH?
NO MORE STREET CORNERS?

20:09.834 --> 20:12.542
OH, BOY,
ARE WE GOING NOW, HUH?

20:12.628 --> 20:13.959
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.332
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.915
- NICE SPEECH.
- THANK YOU.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.549
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT
MUCH LONGER, YOU UNDERSTAND?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.300
IF I DON'T GET PAID,
YOU DON'T HAVE THE HALL

20:25.391 --> 20:27.553
- TOMORROW NIGHT.
- GIBBONS, WILL YOU COOL IT?!

20:27.643 --> 20:29.350
CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE BUSY?

20:29.437 --> 20:32.145
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA WAIT
ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES!

20:32.231 --> 20:34.563
I WANT IT SETTLED NOW.
I TOLD YOU,

20:34.650 --> 20:36.266
NO DOUGH, NO RENTAL.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.397
NO DOUGH, NO USE OF THE HALL
TOMORROW NIGHT.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.774
I'M NOT RUNNING THIS PLACE
JUST FOR PLEASURE.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.027
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.233
THIS IS A VERY HUNGRY MAN HERE.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.113
HE GOT TO HAVE HIS SHEKELS,

20:47.204 --> 20:48.990
GOT TO HAVE HIS
LITTLE OLD MONEY.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.574
I TOLD YOU GUYS YOU VVERE
THREE VVEEKS BACK IN RENT.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.534
YOU SAID YOU'D
GIVE ME IT A WEEK AGO.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.165
AND ALL I DID GET WAS
CIGARETTE BUTTS ON THE FLOOR.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.374
AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
GONNA LOCK US OUT OF THIS HALL

21:00.468 --> 21:02.254
BECAUSE OF A COUPLE WEEKS' RENT?

21:02.344 --> 21:05.006
YOU UNDERSTAND RIGHT.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.885
$200 DUE,
$200 THAT I AIN'T RECEIVED.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.809
WE HAPPEN TO BE
A YOUNG MOVEMENT.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.355
WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING.
WE NEED TIME TO GROW.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.773
BUT I DON'T RENT TIME--

21:17.860 --> 21:20.397
I JUST RENT THE HALL.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.978
IT'S THE MONEY

21:22.072 --> 21:25.610
OR YOU BUILD A PLATFORM
IN THE STREET.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.243
WHEW.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.045
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, PETE?
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.623
I DON'T SEE WHY WE WALK
TIPTOE WITH THIS GUY.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.129
WHY DON'T I EDUCATE HIM?
I CAN DO IT.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.836
- I GUARANTEE IT.
- YEAH.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.012
- SOMEBODY LEFT THIS FOR YOU.
- WHO?

21:48.098 --> 21:50.556
NOBODY SAW HIM.
IT WAS LEFT AT THE BACK DOOR

21:50.643 --> 21:53.226
YOUR NAME IS ON IT.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.178
TWO C's!

21:55.272 --> 21:58.060
HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT, HUH?
WE NEEDED 200 BUCKS' FOR RENT,

21:58.150 --> 22:00.232
AND THERE IT IS!

22:00.319 --> 22:02.651
- DID YOU SEE WHO LEFT THIS?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.355
THE MESSAGE WAS JUST
FOR YOU TO GET IT, THAT'S ALL.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.734
GIBBONS, COME AND GET IT.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.300
<i>[laughing]</i>

22:37.356 --> 22:40.348
WHERE'D THE DOUGH COME FROM?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.902
YOU WERE GREAT TONIGHT, PETE.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.276
YOU WERE REALLY SOMETHING.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.904
I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW IT SOUNDED.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.362
YOU HAD THEM...

22:53.414 --> 22:55.200
JUST LIKE THAT, YOU HAD THEM.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.367
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT NOW, FRANK.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.501
NOW WE'RE <i>REALLY</i>
GOING TO MAKE IT.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.008
YOU BET YOUR LIFE.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.320
AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE,
MR. VOLLMER.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.745
VERY EFFECTIVE.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.199
YOU LEARN QUICKLY.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.338
THANK YOU.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.537
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHO I'M THANKING.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.964
IT DOES NOT MAKE
VERY MUCH DIFFERENCE.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.759
I AM JUST PLEASED I COULD HELP.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.965
YOU LEARNED THE STYLE VERY WELL.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.048
YOU DELIVERED THE SPEECH
EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.975
I'M VERY OBLIGED.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.769
THE MONEY?

23:59.855 --> 24:01.812
OH, IT WAS THE LEAST I COULD DO.

24:01.899 --> 24:05.767
WE COULD NOT VERY WELL HAVE YOU
THROWN OUT INTO THE STREETS.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.149
I HAPPEN TO FEEL YOUR WORK
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.196
ARE YOU ONE OF US?

24:11.283 --> 24:12.990
ONE OF <i>YOU,</i> MR. VOLLMER?

24:13.077 --> 24:15.193
YOU MIGHT SAY I AM YOU.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.370
NOW, I HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.415
IWILL CONTINUE
TO GIVE YOU ADVICE.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.789
BUT THERE IS A MATTER
OF GREAT IMPORTANCE

24:23.879 --> 24:25.461
THAT MUST BE TAKEN CARE OF.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.800
WHAT IS IT?

24:27.883 --> 24:30.215
AN EXPEDIENT, MR. VOLLMER.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.464
OH, YOU MIGHT CALL IT A, UH...

24:32.554 --> 24:34.215
<i>A CAUSE CELEBRE.</i>

24:34.306 --> 24:38.766
SOMETHING TO CEMENT
THE ORGANIZATION TOGETHER.

24:38.852 --> 24:42.095
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- A MARTYR.

24:42.189 --> 24:45.147
THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS A MARTYR.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.316
A MARTYR?
HOW DO YOU FIND A MARTYR?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.236
YOU DO NOT <i>FIND</i> ONE,
MR. VOLLMER.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.814
<i>YOU CHOOSE</i> ONE.

24:52.908 --> 24:56.401
YOU TAKE ONE OF NO VALUE,
AND YOU MAKE HIM INTO A SYMBOL.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.032
YOU WRAP HIM IN A FLAG,

24:59.123 --> 25:02.241
AND YOU MAKE HIS DEATH
WORK FOR YOU.

25:02.334 --> 25:07.044
FIND A MAN VVHO IS OF NO
VALUE VVHILE HE'S ALl\/E

25:07.131 --> 25:09.247
BUT WHO CAN SERVE YOU
WHEN HE'S DEAD.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.923
IS THERE SUCH A ONE?

25:11.010 --> 25:14.253
<i>[footsteps approaching]</i>

25:14.346 --> 25:17.805
- WE'RE WAITING, PETE.
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, NICK.

SURE, PETE.

25:22.813 --> 25:26.272

25:26.358 --> 25:29.271
YOU TELL FRANK TO COME IN HERE.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.532
EXCELLENT, MR. VOLLMER.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.158
AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.284
I WAS JUST THINKING...

25:46.378 --> 25:48.870
THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.625
ANOTHER WAY?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.003
THERE IS <i>NO</i> OTHER
WAY, MR. VOLLMER.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.084

25:55.179 --> 25:57.295
IF YOU WEAKEN NOW,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.131
THERE IS NO POINT IN GOING ON.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.477
NOW...

26:01.560 --> 26:03.301
WHEN FRANK COMES BACK,

26:03.395 --> 26:06.478
TELL HIM YOU HAVE
DISCOVERED AN INFORMER.

26:06.565 --> 26:11.105
TELL HIM THE INFORMER HAS
DONE YOU IRREPARABLE DAMAGE.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.563
TELL HIM THE INFORMER
MUST BE PUT OUT OF THE WAY.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.397
BUT...

26:16.492 --> 26:19.484
PUT OUT OF THE WAY
CLEVERLY, MR. VOLLMER.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.115
PUT OUT OF THE WAY SUBTLEY.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.494
PUT OUT OF THE WAY
SO THAT THERE IS SOME QUESTION

26:25.584 --> 26:27.370
AS TO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.724
NICK'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.724
THIS IS AN ACT OF FRIENDSHIP.

YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME,

43:43.663 --> 43:45.449
YOU WOULDN'T PAY ATTENTION.

43:45.540 --> 43:47.747
ON THE CONTRARY.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.996
I LISTENED TO YOU
ALL I COULD STAND.

43:50.086 --> 43:53.750
I COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL
YOU WHAT'S HAPPENED, ERNST.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.753
IT'S TOO INCREDIBLE,
TOO UNBELIEVABLE.

43:56.843 --> 43:58.299
THERE'S NO STOPPING US NOW.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.754
NO STOPPING YOU, PETER.

44:01.848 --> 44:06.388
AN OLD MAN STOPPED YOU TONIGHT,
WITH A FEW WORDS.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.639
HE STOPPED YOU WITH THE TRUTH.

44:08.688 --> 44:11.555
NO, YOU'RE WRONG, ERNST.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.981
IT'S NOT JUST ME ANYMORE.

THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE BEHIND US.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.565
SOMEONE THAT YOU'D TREMBLE AT.

44:18.656 --> 44:21.990
HE'D HAVE TO BE
A VERY IMPOSING FIGURE, PETER.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.942
MORE IMPOSING THAN YOU.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.083

YOU CAN NEVER KILL AN IDEA
WITH A BULLET, PETER.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.716
NEVER.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.638
I'M ALL STEEL NOW.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.057
ERNST, I'M MADE OF STEEL.

45:30.144 --> 45:34.058
NO SENTIMENT, NO SOFTNESS.

45:34.148 --> 45:35.855
JUST PURPOSE AND WILL.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.855
THEN SHOOT.
