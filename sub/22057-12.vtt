00:07.916 --> 00:09.249
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:09.251 --> 00:11.818
my name is Special Agent
Douglas Fischer.

00:12.122 --> 00:14.055
I'm here at the request
of Governor Mahoe

00:14.057 --> 00:16.357
to lead a special FBI task force

00:16.359 --> 00:18.960
focused on the brutal cycle
of gang-related crime

00:18.962 --> 00:20.662
that has plagued this island
in recent months.

00:20.664 --> 00:23.465
It is every citizen's right
to enjoy the freedoms

00:23.467 --> 00:25.600
of the city in which they live.

00:25.602 --> 00:27.769
The people of Hawaii
should be able to say good-bye

00:27.771 --> 00:29.070
to their families in the morning

00:29.072 --> 00:31.072
without having to wonder
whether they'll see them again.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.842
The recent escalation
in violent crime

00:33.844 --> 00:36.144
threatens our very way of life.

00:36.146 --> 00:38.680
Governor Mahoe has given me
the sweeping authority

00:38.682 --> 00:41.616
to ensure that the organizations
behind this violence

00:41.618 --> 00:45.954
are identified, rooted out
and brought to justice.

00:45.956 --> 00:47.288
This is my promise

00:47.290 --> 00:49.524
to the law-abiding citizens
and people of Oahu:

00:49.526 --> 00:50.925
I will not rest,

00:50.927 --> 00:53.161
and I will not falter
in my purpose

00:53.163 --> 00:55.930
until I have restored peace
and tranquility

00:55.932 --> 00:57.999
to this beautiful island.

At this rate, it's gonna
take us six months to unpack.

01:20.857 --> 01:22.924
You do realize you're
supposed to take things

01:22.926 --> 01:25.293
out of the box and put them
in the new house, right?

01:25.295 --> 01:27.128
(chuckles)
Have you seen Albert?

01:27.130 --> 01:29.297
- No.
- Well, we need to find him.

01:29.299 --> 01:30.765
Otherwise, you can explain
to your daughter

01:30.767 --> 01:33.083
that he's decided
not to come live with us in Hawaii.

01:33.084 --> 01:35.370
That is not a conversation
that I want to have ever.

01:35.372 --> 01:38.039
Right? So get looking.

01:42.779 --> 01:44.579
Ah!

01:44.581 --> 01:45.847
Got him.

01:45.849 --> 01:47.515
Crisis averted.

Honey.

Look who's here.

DOUGLAS: Sweetie, why don't you
go give Albert

01:53.423 --> 01:54.589
a tour of his new house?

01:54.591 --> 01:55.557
Come on, Albert.

01:55.559 --> 01:57.392
I'll show you
my room.

01:57.394 --> 02:00.295
I think this new move is
gonna be really good for us.

Me, too.

02:03.033 --> 02:05.166
(doorbell rings)

02:05.168 --> 02:06.601
I will get that.

03:18.053 --> 03:19.586
This is my colleague,
Agent McNeal.

03:19.588 --> 03:21.321
We're part of the
new FBI task force

03:21.323 --> 03:22.622
on organized crime.
Oh, right.

03:22.624 --> 03:24.023
We were told
about your mission brief.

03:24.025 --> 03:26.759
Five-O's totally committed
to help out any way we can.

03:26.761 --> 03:28.127
That's good to hear.

03:28.129 --> 03:30.263
Because we have
something to ask of you.

03:30.265 --> 03:31.564
What is it?

03:31.566 --> 03:33.800
We're examining the timeline
of the recent violence,

03:33.802 --> 03:36.135
seeing if we can identify
what started it all.

03:36.137 --> 03:37.470
DOUGLAS:
It seems like things

03:37.472 --> 03:39.572
really ramped up
about six weeks ago,

03:39.574 --> 03:40.974
around the time when
Michelle Shioma was

03:40.976 --> 03:42.709
shanked to death in the showers
at Kailua Correctional.

03:42.711 --> 03:44.911
Do you know what else
happened six weeks ago?

03:46.114 --> 03:47.580
Adam Noshimuri returned
to the island.

03:47.582 --> 03:50.250
Now, maybe these two events
are somehow related.

03:50.252 --> 03:51.384
I'm going to be honest--

03:51.386 --> 03:53.086
I'm not really liking
where this is going.

03:53.088 --> 03:54.754
McNEAL: Yeah, but you're
aware of Mr. Noshimuri's

03:54.756 --> 03:56.789
very personal connection
to the Yakuza,

03:56.791 --> 03:58.491
are you not?
I'm aware.

03:58.493 --> 03:59.893
It was my understanding
that he's

03:59.895 --> 04:01.194
turned his back on that world.

04:01.196 --> 04:02.629
That's what Commander
McGarrett told you?

04:02.631 --> 04:04.097
Just to be
clear, I have

04:04.099 --> 04:06.065
immense respect for
Commander McGarrett, but...

04:06.067 --> 04:07.934
but he can't be objective
in this matter.

04:07.936 --> 04:09.569
He's blinded by his
personal relationship

04:09.571 --> 04:10.937
with Mr. Noshimuri.

04:10.939 --> 04:13.139
With an investigation
of this scale,

04:13.141 --> 04:16.676
with this much at stake,
I have a responsibility

04:16.678 --> 04:18.845
to investigate
absolutely every lead.

04:18.846 --> 04:20.779
And that very much
includes Adam Noshimuri.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.048
So, to be clear,

04:22.050 --> 04:25.285
you came over to my house
to ask me to spy

04:25.287 --> 04:26.586
on my boss for you?

04:26.588 --> 04:28.988
All we're asking for is
your impartial perspective.

04:28.990 --> 04:31.624
Anything to do with
Mr. Noshimuri-- you listen,

04:31.626 --> 04:33.126
you observe, you
report back to us.

04:33.128 --> 04:35.428
DOUGLAS: Look, I'm aware you just got
your badge with Five-O,

04:35.430 --> 04:37.830
but doing a favor like this
for the Bureau

04:37.832 --> 04:39.565
could really mean
a lot of opportunities

04:39.567 --> 04:41.100
for somebody like you.

04:43.438 --> 04:45.605
Why don't you
think about it.

04:53.415 --> 04:54.514
Agent Fischer, how you doing?

04:54.516 --> 04:55.782
Commander.

04:55.784 --> 04:56.916
Thanks for making
some time for me.

04:56.918 --> 04:58.985
I appreciate it.
How can we help?

04:58.987 --> 05:01.054
You guys have got
a big job ahead of you.

05:01.056 --> 05:02.422
Got a lot of ground to cover.

05:02.424 --> 05:04.057
I, uh, thought maybe
I could help you

05:04.059 --> 05:06.459
save some valuable time.

05:06.461 --> 05:09.395
Bottom line: Adam Noshimuri,
he's a good man.

05:10.231 --> 05:11.364
Was he always?

05:11.366 --> 05:13.766
'Cause we heard
something different.

05:14.970 --> 05:17.103
Yeah, I understand. Um...

05:17.105 --> 05:18.504
Here's the thing.
Look, he, uh...

05:18.506 --> 05:20.139
he married a member of my team.

05:20.141 --> 05:22.308
With my blessing,
all right?

05:22.310 --> 05:27.080
This man has proven his loyalty
to me over and over again.

05:27.082 --> 05:29.115
I trust him with my life, okay?

05:29.117 --> 05:30.383
That's got to stand
for something.

05:30.385 --> 05:31.584
All reasons
why I didn't

05:31.586 --> 05:33.886
come to you with this
in the beginning.

05:33.888 --> 05:35.989
Okay.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.156
All right.

05:37.158 --> 05:38.825
Let me just be clear
about one thing.

05:38.827 --> 05:41.027
You approach a member
of my team again

05:41.029 --> 05:42.462
without my knowledge,

05:42.464 --> 05:44.464
we're gonna have
a different conversation.

05:44.466 --> 05:46.366
It's not gonna be
as polite as this, all right?

05:46.368 --> 05:48.434
Thanks for your time.

05:52.448 --> 05:54.408
My name is Special Agent
Douglas Fischer.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.537
Found it.

05:55.539 --> 05:56.738
DOUGLAS:

05:56.740 --> 05:58.673

06:03.713 --> 06:04.913
Get back!

06:04.915 --> 06:07.048
(explosion)

06:21.364 --> 06:23.097
I still have to
perform the autopsies,

06:23.099 --> 06:24.466
but based on the burns

06:24.468 --> 06:26.034
and the report
from the crime scene,

06:26.036 --> 06:29.804
I'd say the victims
probably died instantly.

06:33.510 --> 06:35.376
When they brought in
the little girl's body,

06:35.378 --> 06:37.479
this was still in her hands.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.981
She must have been holding it
when she was killed.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.262
CSU's been at it
for over an hour.

06:54.264 --> 06:56.998
Looks like there's no evidence
of the incendiary device.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.533
Yeah, well,
an explosion that size,

06:58.535 --> 07:00.835
we're not gonna get any evidence
from the crime scene, either.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.104
Which means we probably have
zero chance of tracing

07:03.106 --> 07:05.473
the bomb back to whoever
it was that made it.

07:05.475 --> 07:06.708
Oh, look at that.

07:06.710 --> 07:07.842
Sorry, kid.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.044
Hell of a case for
your first day on the job.

07:10.046 --> 07:11.679
Yeah. Yeah, we just
got off the phone

07:11.681 --> 07:14.215
with Sergeant Lukela,
and he says that HPD

07:14.217 --> 07:16.217
has a four-block perimeter
around the blast site.

07:16.219 --> 07:18.653
And right now, they're currently
canvassing the neighborhood.

07:18.655 --> 07:19.954
TANI: Yeah, they also
got officers

07:19.956 --> 07:21.055
doing door-to-doors.

07:21.057 --> 07:22.223
No one's seen anything yet.

07:22.225 --> 07:23.558
GROVER: Well, that's
just perfect.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.193
So we got no evidence
and no witnesses.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.228
TANI: Well, there's no
shortage of suspects.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.197
Remember Agent Fischer
went on TV this morning,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.632
he declared war on every gang

07:30.634 --> 07:31.866
on the island?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.401
JUNIOR: Gang that was
in Fischer's crosshairs

07:33.403 --> 07:34.736
could be a suspect.

07:34.738 --> 07:36.571
So we'll bring them all in.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.507
Every single one of them,
anyone who has

07:39.509 --> 07:41.276
any connections
to OC on this island,

07:41.278 --> 07:42.844
we'll bring them all in,
we'll press

07:42.846 --> 07:45.113
every single one of them
until someone rolls and talks.

07:45.115 --> 07:47.448
'Cause I'm telling you,
somebody has to know

07:47.450 --> 07:48.583
something about this.

07:48.585 --> 07:50.151
Listen, don't shoot
the messenger,

07:50.153 --> 07:51.920
but on an island
of a million people,

07:51.922 --> 07:53.855
as many people we got here
that could be

07:53.857 --> 07:55.657
connected to OC
or violent crime,

07:55.659 --> 07:56.991
you're talking about
a suspect pool

07:56.993 --> 07:58.493
that could be well
into the hundreds.

07:58.495 --> 08:01.062
Now, how do you suppose we bring
all those people in here?

08:01.064 --> 08:03.498
We're gonna need some help.

08:19.909 --> 08:21.576
Let's go. Keep moving.

08:26.616 --> 08:29.017

08:31.988 --> 08:33.821

08:35.058 --> 08:36.624
Five-O! Get 'em up!
Move, move, move!

08:36.626 --> 08:38.960
Get 'em up! Get 'em up!
You, hands behind your head.

08:38.962 --> 08:40.328
Get 'em up!
Hands! Hands!

08:40.330 --> 08:43.431
Hands behind your head!
Interlock your fingers!

08:48.138 --> 08:49.370
(indistinct shouting)

08:49.372 --> 08:50.571
Walk forward. Let's go.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.507
Walk forward.

08:52.509 --> 08:54.142
Let's go. Get outside.

08:54.144 --> 08:55.443
Get on your knees.

08:55.445 --> 08:57.745
On your knees.
On your knees.

08:57.747 --> 08:58.946
On your knees.
On your knees.

08:58.948 --> 09:00.248
On your knees.
Keep 'em up, keep 'em up.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.150
Come on, let's keep 'em up.

09:08.191 --> 09:10.892
(siren whooping)

09:13.330 --> 09:14.662
Hey, where we at?

09:14.664 --> 09:16.931
Just did a count.
As of now,

09:16.933 --> 09:19.367
we have 87 suspects
in custody.

09:19.369 --> 09:20.902
That's good, but we gotta
pick up the pace.

09:20.904 --> 09:23.471
All right, everybody,
bring it in, bring it in.

09:23.473 --> 09:25.206
Come here.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.742
All right,
this is a good start.

09:27.744 --> 09:30.812
But, unfortunately, we have lost
the element of surprise.

09:30.814 --> 09:32.246
All right, we longer
have that on our side.

09:32.248 --> 09:33.915
The word is on the street
that we're bringing people in,

09:33.917 --> 09:35.316
so we need to speed this up,
right?

09:35.318 --> 09:37.018
Close the net
before any of our suspects

09:37.020 --> 09:38.686
go to ground. Now, Duke--

09:38.688 --> 09:40.955
I need you to cancel
all officer leave.

09:40.957 --> 09:42.290
We need to double
our efforts.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.025
The next few hours
are critical.

09:44.027 --> 09:45.493
We still have 54 people

09:45.495 --> 09:47.495
that we need to bring in
for questioning.

09:47.497 --> 09:48.596
HPD, SWAT,
National Guard--

09:48.598 --> 09:50.765
you guys divide that
amongst yourselves.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.133
Five-O Task Force is gonna focus

09:52.135 --> 09:54.369
on high-value targets--
known gang heads.

09:54.371 --> 09:56.037
Any questions?

09:56.039 --> 09:58.206
Good. Let's get 'em.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.407
Thanks, Duke.

10:00.310 --> 10:01.976
Junior.

10:01.978 --> 10:03.511
This is for you.

10:03.513 --> 10:05.646
I want you to pick
this guy up, all right?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.181
HPD's going to accompany you.

10:08.084 --> 10:09.617
JUNIOR:
Luis Alvarez.

10:09.619 --> 10:11.586
GTA, burglary, assault.

10:11.588 --> 10:12.754
Sir.

10:12.756 --> 10:14.589
Huh?
With all due respect, uh,

10:14.591 --> 10:16.157
this Alvarez character, uh,

10:16.159 --> 10:18.593
I know that he's a...
he's a bad guy,

10:18.595 --> 10:21.095
but I thought we were focusing
on high-value targets.

10:21.097 --> 10:23.197
We are. What's the problem?

10:23.199 --> 10:25.032
Why do I need backup?

10:26.035 --> 10:28.603
No, no, no, you...
you are the backup.

10:28.605 --> 10:30.238
Baby steps, all right?

10:30.240 --> 10:32.206
Baby steps.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.341
(cell phone ringing)

10:33.343 --> 10:35.343
Jerry, what do we got?

10:35.345 --> 10:37.412
I'm patched into the
surveillance cams down there.

10:37.414 --> 10:39.013
I also got mics in every cell,

10:39.015 --> 10:41.616
so if any perp so much
as mentions Agent Fischer,

10:41.618 --> 10:43.251
I'll hear it.

10:43.253 --> 10:45.887
I'm also running
through the crime stat data

10:45.889 --> 10:47.321
to see if that leads anywhere.

10:47.323 --> 10:49.056
All right, where we at
locating these targets?

10:49.058 --> 10:51.325
Our resident expert's
working on that now.

10:51.327 --> 10:55.763
Kamekona figures he's got a lead
on a couple high-value perps.

10:55.765 --> 10:57.632
Here, I'll let you
talk to him.

10:57.634 --> 11:00.034
Boss man,
made a few calls.

11:00.036 --> 11:02.303
Seems like all those cops
on the street,

11:02.305 --> 11:03.771
they got the bosses spooked.

11:03.773 --> 11:06.040
Hitting up all
those safe houses.

11:06.042 --> 11:09.043
But I got locations
on two of your targets:

11:09.045 --> 11:12.547
a Hector Garcia
and a Damien Bautista.

11:12.549 --> 11:14.081
Sending now, boss.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.716
Heads up, McGarrett.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.186
This intel's got
an expiration date.

11:18.188 --> 11:20.321
These dudes won't stay put
for long.

11:20.323 --> 11:21.489
Copy you, big guy.

11:21.491 --> 11:22.757
Thank you. We're on it.

11:22.759 --> 11:24.659
(cell phones chime)

11:25.728 --> 11:27.628
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding me.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.263
What do you mean?
You know this guy?

11:30.366 --> 11:32.266
Yeah, kind of.

11:32.268 --> 11:35.203
All right, Lou,
you go with TANI.

11:35.205 --> 11:36.204
I'll pick up Garcia.

11:36.206 --> 11:37.939
Actually, uh, if
it's okay, I think

11:37.941 --> 11:39.307
maybe I should go by myself.

11:39.309 --> 11:40.708
If I show up alone,

11:40.710 --> 11:42.210
Damien's not gonna
suspect anything.

11:42.212 --> 11:43.678
We can catch him off guard.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.213
“Damien”?

11:51.554 --> 11:53.020
All right, be careful.

11:53.022 --> 11:54.555
I will.

11:56.359 --> 11:58.659
Come on.
Back to work, Eddie.

12:10.139 --> 12:12.206
What's with
the stink eye, Eddie?

12:12.208 --> 12:15.042
I thought I was
your Uncle Lou.

12:18.047 --> 12:19.547
Hey, man.

12:19.549 --> 12:22.783
Why he looking at me
like I'm the vet or something?

12:22.785 --> 12:25.386
You're sitting
in his seat.

12:27.924 --> 12:30.091
(quiet growling)

12:35.498 --> 12:37.965
Okay.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.500
Right here, right here.

12:39.502 --> 12:41.302
Right here.

12:41.304 --> 12:43.070
Okay.

12:43.072 --> 12:44.572
According to
Kamekona's Intel,

12:44.574 --> 12:46.507
this is where Garcia's been holed up.
(whistles)

12:46.509 --> 12:48.776
GROVER:
What the hell, man?

12:48.778 --> 12:50.011
I mean, isn't a safe house--

12:50.013 --> 12:53.047
the purpose of it
to be off the radar?

12:53.049 --> 12:54.515
Yeah, the balls
on this guy

12:54.517 --> 12:55.783
hiding in plain
sight like this.

12:55.785 --> 12:57.885
He must have a
big crew inside.

12:57.887 --> 13:00.154
Got a heat signature
from our satellite.

13:00.156 --> 13:01.289
Looks like...

13:01.291 --> 13:04.125
looks like he's alone
on the first floor.

13:05.361 --> 13:06.861
(whispering):
Eddie.

13:06.863 --> 13:08.229
On me. You ready?

13:08.231 --> 13:09.497
Let's go.

13:09.499 --> 13:11.899
Go, go, Eddie, go.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.206
This ought
to be easy,

13:19.208 --> 13:21.642
but it rarely is.

13:22.512 --> 13:24.879
All right, Eddie,
go up, go up.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.583
Go on.

13:46.135 --> 13:48.402
(siren whooping)

14:13.329 --> 14:14.528
Adam Noshimuri...

14:14.530 --> 14:16.364
Agent McNeal,
FBI Special Task Force.

14:16.366 --> 14:18.099
Step out of the vehicle, please.

14:20.036 --> 14:22.036
Have I done something wrong?

14:22.038 --> 14:24.005
Just get out of the car, sir.

14:31.180 --> 14:33.047
How can I help you, Agent?

14:33.049 --> 14:34.982
I have some questions for you.

14:34.984 --> 14:37.952
You mind telling me
what this is all about?

14:37.954 --> 14:39.854
Oh, I think you know.

14:47.530 --> 14:49.063
There's no sign
of this guy.

14:49.065 --> 14:50.231
He got a big crib,

14:50.233 --> 14:52.233
and he gotta be hiding
in here somewhere.

14:52.235 --> 14:53.868
Tell you what.

14:56.105 --> 14:58.239
See what the old
eye in the sky has to say.

14:58.241 --> 15:00.207
All right.

15:02.211 --> 15:03.477
There's you. There's me.

15:04.347 --> 15:06.681
There goes Eddie.

15:10.086 --> 15:11.552
This guy a magician
or something?

15:11.554 --> 15:12.687
It's weird.

15:12.689 --> 15:14.789
(Eddie barking)

15:16.926 --> 15:18.392
(growls)

15:20.363 --> 15:22.763
What do you got, Eddie?
Good boy.

15:22.765 --> 15:24.398
Good boy.

15:25.768 --> 15:27.334
All right.

15:27.336 --> 15:28.703
You ready?
Yeah.

15:28.705 --> 15:29.937
Go.

15:33.676 --> 15:34.875
GROVER:
Huh.

15:34.877 --> 15:36.610
Now, that is one

15:36.612 --> 15:38.412
genuine Houdini move.

15:38.414 --> 15:40.481
Looks like it leads to some kind
of underground tunnel.

15:40.483 --> 15:42.383
Uh-huh.

15:43.219 --> 15:45.252
After you.

15:45.254 --> 15:47.722
Nah, I got a better idea.

15:51.594 --> 15:52.727
(barks)

15:52.729 --> 15:54.462
(growls)
(yells, grunts)

15:54.464 --> 15:55.563
There he is.

15:55.565 --> 15:56.764
Get him off!

15:56.766 --> 15:58.799
(grunting)

15:58.801 --> 15:59.801
Hey, get him off me!

16:00.202 --> 16:02.169
Hey!

16:02.171 --> 16:03.270
Get him off!

16:03.272 --> 16:04.638
Get him off me!

16:04.640 --> 16:05.839
(grunts) Okay!

16:05.841 --> 16:07.241
Get him off!
GROVER: Relax, Hector.

16:07.243 --> 16:08.609
He just wants
to get to know you.

16:08.611 --> 16:10.644
Give me that.
Good boy, good boy.

16:10.646 --> 16:12.779
Get up. Get up!
Come on.

16:12.781 --> 16:13.947
Get up, man. You ain't hurt.
Get up.

16:13.949 --> 16:17.251
Turn around. Put your hands
behind your back.

16:17.253 --> 16:18.418
(knock at door)

16:18.420 --> 16:20.487
♪ This is the moment
we all been waiting for ♪

16:20.489 --> 16:22.456
♪ Waiting for,
just look up to the stars... ♪

16:22.458 --> 16:23.924
Well, looky here.

16:25.094 --> 16:27.194
Been a while, shorty.
Mm-hmm.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.529
Can I come in?

16:28.531 --> 16:31.064
Can I trust you not
to break anything?

16:31.066 --> 16:33.267
Well, since I no longer care
that you're seeing other women,

16:33.269 --> 16:35.669
I'd say... yeah,
your stuff's safe.

16:35.671 --> 16:38.372
(chuckles)

16:40.309 --> 16:42.009
Wow.

16:42.011 --> 16:44.745
Hey, you redecorated.

16:45.614 --> 16:47.047
Yes, I did.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.815
Looks good.

16:48.817 --> 16:50.551
Grew your hair out.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.153
Mm-hmm.

16:53.155 --> 16:55.455
I did.
How's baby bro?

16:55.457 --> 16:56.557
Koa? He's good.

16:56.559 --> 16:59.059
You know, now that
you're not in his life,

16:59.061 --> 17:00.961
getting him involved
in all your schemes.

17:00.963 --> 17:02.930
(chuckles)
Well, you didn't always think

17:02.932 --> 17:05.232
it was a bad idea
to be involved in my schemes.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.702
That's true, but I also thought
Capri pants were cute.

17:08.704 --> 17:10.871
But we all make mistakes.

17:10.873 --> 17:14.208
You know, speaking of mistakes,
heard you got

17:14.210 --> 17:16.108
booted from cop school.

17:16.111 --> 17:18.612
Guess you can't fight
your upbringing.

17:20.182 --> 17:22.316
Mm-hmm. I did.

17:22.318 --> 17:25.252
Got kicked out
of the police academy.

17:26.387 --> 17:28.956
But you know me--
I always bounce back.

17:30.059 --> 17:32.059
Yeah.

17:33.429 --> 17:35.729
So, what you got
going on now?

17:35.731 --> 17:38.065
Mall security? TSA?

17:38.067 --> 17:39.233
Five-O.

17:39.235 --> 17:41.802
In fact, I'm here
on official business.

17:41.804 --> 17:43.170
I'm taking you in.

17:43.172 --> 17:44.905
- Bring me in for what?
- Oh, you're not watching the news?

17:44.907 --> 17:47.241
A man and his family
were murdered.

17:47.243 --> 17:49.009
You think I got something
to do with that?

17:49.011 --> 17:50.644
That's what we're gonna
find out, aren't we?

17:50.646 --> 17:52.646
I ain't going nowhere
with you today.

17:52.648 --> 17:53.780
Okay.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.682
You sure you want
to play it like that?

17:55.684 --> 17:57.618
(vehicles arriving)

17:57.620 --> 17:59.419
Are you?

18:00.956 --> 18:02.956
What did you do?

18:02.958 --> 18:04.958
Oh, I figured the cops
would come for me.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.195
I called some boys about
ten minutes before you got here.

18:08.197 --> 18:12.232
They're gonna take me
someplace nice and quiet, so...

18:12.234 --> 18:14.668
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

18:14.670 --> 18:18.672
You and me-- just another case
of bad timing, right?

18:27.950 --> 18:30.584
We need someone
posted outside.

18:30.586 --> 18:32.185
We'll bring him out.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.158
(gunfire)

18:50.721 --> 18:52.021
Get down! Keep your head down!

18:52.023 --> 18:54.123
Hey, get back here,
get back here.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.458
Come on. Get back here.

18:56.460 --> 18:58.194
Head down, head down.

18:59.130 --> 19:01.530
Put pressure on that.
(gunfire continues)

19:03.134 --> 19:05.367
This is Officer Junior
Reigns with Five-O

19:05.369 --> 19:06.368
requesting backup.

19:06.370 --> 19:07.970
We got two
officers down.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.605
One dead and
one wounded.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.940
Where you gonna go?

19:16.514 --> 19:18.380
Gonna go get our perp.

19:24.322 --> 19:25.921
(grunts)

19:47.979 --> 19:50.646
(gunfire)

19:55.586 --> 19:57.353
(small explosion)

19:57.355 --> 19:59.955
(grunting and groaning)

20:07.465 --> 20:09.665
(panting)

20:10.835 --> 20:13.068
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

20:27.760 --> 20:29.627
What happened to the suspect?

20:31.180 --> 20:33.013
He's dead.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.484
Hey, when EMTs are done
with Officer Ojoa,

20:37.486 --> 20:40.387
let 'em know I might need
a hand with this.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.325
(elevator bell dings)

20:51.300 --> 20:53.033
You really think that's
going to keep them out?

20:53.035 --> 20:54.568
Probably not,
but it'll buy us some time.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.137
Girl, there's no way your backup
is getting here in time,

20:57.139 --> 20:58.972
so... old times' sake,

20:58.974 --> 21:01.308
I'm gonna do you a favor.

21:01.310 --> 21:02.509
That right?
That's right.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.710
Here's how
it's gonna go.

21:03.712 --> 21:05.179
You let me walk
out of here,

21:05.181 --> 21:06.880
I leave with my crew,
and you get to live.

21:06.882 --> 21:09.616
- That's so generous of you.
- Yeah, take me up on the offer.

21:09.618 --> 21:12.519
'Cause, if you don't,
I guarantee it won't end well.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.554
(pounding)

21:13.556 --> 21:15.055
MAN: Damien, open
the door, man! Open up!

21:15.057 --> 21:16.690
There's no other way out of this.
MAN: Damien!

21:16.692 --> 21:18.525
Hey, I got
Five-O in here!

21:18.527 --> 21:20.594
(heavy gunfire)

21:20.596 --> 21:21.595
You know what?

21:21.597 --> 21:23.931
You always did lack imagination.

21:36.612 --> 21:37.778
Damien, where's you at?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.249
(groans)
I think I bust a rib.

21:42.251 --> 21:43.750
Better shut up and move.

21:43.752 --> 21:45.519
You want me to break
your arm, too?

21:56.565 --> 21:59.533
I wouldn't get too comfortable
if I was you, Hector.

21:59.535 --> 22:03.003
Gonna come back for a little
Q-and-A in a little bit.

22:03.005 --> 22:05.906
Maybe I'll bring Eddie back
for you.

22:05.908 --> 22:10.577
Hey. Damien's in cell 17,
so looks like we're two for two.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.145
What in the hell
happened to you?

22:12.147 --> 22:15.015
Oh, it was just like
an unexpected swim.

22:15.017 --> 22:16.984
It was actually
quite refreshing.

22:16.986 --> 22:19.353
You should try it.
STEVE: All right, copy that.

22:19.355 --> 22:20.587
Appreciate it. Thank you.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.089
All right. Yeah.

22:23.158 --> 22:25.225
Now what?
That was Duke.

22:25.227 --> 22:27.427
I guess Junior got winged
during the raid on Luis Alvarez.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.396
TANI: Oh, my God. Is he okay?
STEVE: He's gonna be fine.

22:29.398 --> 22:31.331
In fact, he saved one
of the cops' lives.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.167
The other officer,
unfortunately, wasn't so lucky.

22:34.169 --> 22:35.502
What about Alvarez?

22:35.504 --> 22:38.038
Alvarez ain't gonna answer
any questions, either.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.406
All right, what do we do now?

22:39.408 --> 22:41.141
Well, we got 169
suspects in custody.

22:41.143 --> 22:43.176
Let's shake some cages,
get some answers.

22:50.319 --> 22:52.953
Gonna talk about Agent Fischer
for a minute, all right?

22:52.955 --> 22:54.588
Agent Fischer
was a threat to you

22:54.590 --> 22:56.189
and your organization,
wasn't he?

22:57.760 --> 23:00.961
You know we got one of your
boys to roll on you, right?

23:00.963 --> 23:03.363
He told us you had him
scope out Fischer's place

23:03.365 --> 23:04.698
a couple days ago.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.000
The bomb-- who made it for you?

23:07.836 --> 23:09.269
Give me a name,

23:09.271 --> 23:10.804
or I swear you're
gonna rot in here.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.939
STEVE:
<i>And that's why you</i>

23:11.941 --> 23:13.006
took him out, wasn't it?

23:13.008 --> 23:14.308
'Cause you thought
the next right step

23:14.310 --> 23:16.476
was to kill him--
kill him and his family.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.945
You think you're
gonna send a message

23:17.947 --> 23:19.646
to law enforcement
that you're untouchable?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.214
Is that it?

23:21.216 --> 23:24.651
Is it just me, or have we
just been banging our heads

23:24.653 --> 23:26.353
against a wall for
the last three hours?

23:26.355 --> 23:28.889
Yeah, I mean, for me it's a
lot of just finger pointing,

23:28.891 --> 23:30.791
everyone blaming each other
for the Fischer hit.

23:30.793 --> 23:32.159
I tell you what--

23:32.161 --> 23:33.794
either they all
got together beforehand

23:33.796 --> 23:35.595
and made sure
their stories lined up,

23:35.597 --> 23:37.197
or...
Or they're telling the truth.

23:37.199 --> 23:39.333
Yeah.
They're all telling the truth.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.668
All right? We all heard it
over and over again.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.003
These guys are in survival mode.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.973
They're so busy
dealing with a turf war,

23:45.975 --> 23:47.140
they don't have
time to make

23:47.142 --> 23:49.076
a high-profile hit
like the one on Fischer.

23:49.078 --> 23:52.579
And yet, we got Agent Fischer
and his family all dead now.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.682
Jerry.
JERRY (over phone): Steve.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.950
Hey, listen, man,
we're not getting

23:56.952 --> 23:58.285
very far in the interrogations.

23:58.287 --> 24:00.487
Nobody claims to know a thing
about the Agent Fischer hit.

24:00.489 --> 24:02.589
Please tell me you got something
off the hidden mics.

24:02.591 --> 24:03.623
Still nothing.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.325
Well, that's not entirely true.

24:05.327 --> 24:06.860
I know a guy that's got 60 grand

24:06.862 --> 24:08.362
buried in his mother's
back garden.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.732
But as far as the Fischer hit,
Nada, zilcho; but I did find

24:11.734 --> 24:13.033
something interesting.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.268
I went through the police
reports and the crime stats,

24:15.270 --> 24:16.770
and there's an anomaly
in the data.

24:16.772 --> 24:18.071
TANI:
What kind of anomaly?

24:18.073 --> 24:20.173
Well, aside from the prison hit
on Michelle Shioma,

24:20.175 --> 24:23.944
the Yakuza has largely avoided
casualties in all this violence.

24:23.946 --> 24:28.081
Certainly nowhere near the level
of comparable OC crews.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.816
Is it just me,
or is that weird?

24:29.818 --> 24:32.252
I'm gonna go with “suspicious.”
STEVE: Wait a minute.

24:32.254 --> 24:34.488
Who is running
the Yakuza these days?

24:34.490 --> 24:36.023
Well, according to CIU,
it's this guy

24:36.025 --> 24:37.524
named Brandon Kenzo.

24:37.526 --> 24:40.227
He's on our list, but CIU
has no clue of his whereabouts.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.195
They haven't had eyes on him
for four months.

24:42.197 --> 24:43.630
STEVE:
All right, wait a minute.

24:43.632 --> 24:44.631
Let's think
about this for a second.

24:44.633 --> 24:45.932
Michelle Shioma was arrested,

24:45.934 --> 24:48.101
and it weakened the Yakuza,
right?

24:48.103 --> 24:49.302
So Kenzo takes her out

24:49.304 --> 24:50.837
so he can take over
the organization.

24:50.839 --> 24:53.073
Okay, he takes her out,
and then what does he do?

24:53.075 --> 24:55.675
He starts
an island-wide gang war

24:55.677 --> 24:57.444
to decimate the competition.

24:57.446 --> 24:58.812
Well, that would explain
why the Yakuza's

24:58.814 --> 25:00.714
the only outfit that hasn't
been hurt by all of this.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.816
Right.
And why Kenzo's been

25:02.818 --> 25:03.850
in hiding.

25:03.852 --> 25:05.786
I mean, it's kind of
a genius plan.

25:05.788 --> 25:07.888
He just lays back and lets

25:07.890 --> 25:09.623
all the other gangs
on the island

25:09.625 --> 25:10.857
cannibalize
each other.

25:10.859 --> 25:11.992
Right, then
the governor

25:11.994 --> 25:13.660
brings Fischer in
to clean up the gangs.

25:13.662 --> 25:16.029
Kenzo figures that the Feds
are gonna learn

25:16.031 --> 25:18.565
it was him who started
all the violence...

25:18.567 --> 25:20.500
And he hits Fischer.
Makes sense to me.

25:20.502 --> 25:21.635
We gotta track down Kenzo.

25:21.637 --> 25:22.903
All right, well,

25:22.905 --> 25:24.204
even if any one of his crew

25:24.206 --> 25:25.605
know where he might
be laying low,

25:25.607 --> 25:26.873
I don't think
they're gonna talk.

25:26.875 --> 25:27.874
Jerry.

25:27.876 --> 25:29.643
I'm way ahead of you.

25:30.879 --> 25:33.413
We, uh, happen to have somebody
at our disposal who has contacts

25:33.415 --> 25:35.382
in that world.
Come on, man, you got Adam

25:35.384 --> 25:36.583
on the phone yet or what?

25:36.585 --> 25:38.952
No, his cell's going
straight to voice mail.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.854
Better ping it.

25:42.024 --> 25:43.323
Ping that phone.

25:43.325 --> 25:44.925
Call me back.

25:49.598 --> 25:51.765
McNEAL:
<i>Okay, let's go over it again.</i>

25:51.767 --> 25:55.702
Starting with when you arrived
in Hawaii six weeks ago.

25:55.704 --> 25:57.704
Look, I don't know
how many times

25:57.706 --> 25:59.539
I can tell you
the same thing.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.441
Well, then try something else.

26:01.443 --> 26:03.577
Like the truth.
The truth is,

26:03.579 --> 26:05.278
I have nothing to hide.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.813
Is that right?
Yeah, it is.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.248
And I think you know that.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.417
You know, I'm not
one of those people

26:10.419 --> 26:13.620
who thinks that life is full
of harmless little coincidences.

26:13.622 --> 26:17.624
The way I see it, the
timing of your return

26:17.626 --> 26:19.593
is too suspicious.

26:19.595 --> 26:22.062
Plus, in all my years
of doing this,

26:22.064 --> 26:25.665
I've never heard of anyone
retiring from the Yakuza.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.334
You get out
when you die.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.102
That's how it
is with them.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.770
What can I say?

26:30.772 --> 26:34.207
There's always an exception
to every rule, Agent McNeal.

26:34.209 --> 26:35.542
Excuse me.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.481
Agent McNeal is in a meeting.

26:41.483 --> 26:44.017
You can't go
in there.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.420
Hey. Whatever's going on here,
it's over. You all right?

26:47.422 --> 26:49.489
- That is not your call, Commander.
- What did I tell you, huh?

26:49.491 --> 26:50.690
Your friend here
is a person of interest

26:50.692 --> 26:52.959
in our investigation.
No, my friend here

26:52.961 --> 26:56.196
is a victim of harassment
by the Bureau.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.298
Now, if you're gonna
charge him, he can stay.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.533
Otherwise, we're leaving.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.035
- Okay. Sure.
- All right, good. Let's go.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.170
Hey, before you leave,

27:03.172 --> 27:04.804
there's something
I'd like you to see.

27:04.806 --> 27:06.339
And what's that?

27:07.176 --> 27:08.909
It's a little gift
from our friends

27:08.911 --> 27:12.345
at Women's Community
Correctional in Kailua.

27:12.347 --> 27:14.881
See, less than 24 hours
before she was killed

27:14.883 --> 27:17.217
in prison, Michelle Shioma
received a visitor.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.219
You remember her,
Commander?

27:19.221 --> 27:22.289
She used to run the Yakuza
here on the island.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.158
Go ahead.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.826
Take a look.

27:30.032 --> 27:32.732
Do you still think
we're harassing your friend?

27:57.230 --> 27:58.629
Listen.

27:58.631 --> 28:00.664
A few days after
I got back to Hawaii,

28:00.666 --> 28:03.200
Michelle Shioma reached out
to me through an intermediary.

28:03.202 --> 28:04.935
She wanted me to come see her.

28:05.805 --> 28:07.805
You didn't say no?
I did.

28:07.807 --> 28:09.740
But then I got to thinking

28:09.742 --> 28:12.843
about what she could
possibly want, and...

28:12.845 --> 28:16.046
I don't know, I guess my
curiosity got the better of me.

28:22.121 --> 28:25.823
I have to admit, I'm surprised
you agreed to meet me.

28:25.825 --> 28:27.591
Most people wouldn't sit down
with someone

28:27.593 --> 28:30.194
who tried to kill them
on multiple occasions.

28:30.196 --> 28:31.462
What do you want, Michelle?

28:32.398 --> 28:34.698
You have four minutes
of my curiosity left

28:34.700 --> 28:36.634
before I get up
and walk out of here.

28:36.636 --> 28:39.603
So, what was it that
Michelle Shioma had to say?

28:39.605 --> 28:41.205
Michelle Shioma will do and say

28:41.207 --> 28:43.641
whatever it takes
to get what she wants.

28:43.643 --> 28:44.942
After my sentencing,

28:44.944 --> 28:48.746
the Feds put my kids
in protective custody.

28:48.748 --> 28:51.148
Six months later,
I still have no idea

28:51.150 --> 28:53.350
where they are
or how they're doing.

28:53.352 --> 28:54.585
I'm sorry to hear that,

28:54.587 --> 28:57.121
but what does any of that
have to do with me?

28:57.123 --> 28:59.523
I want you to track
my children down,

28:59.525 --> 29:01.358
check in on them,

29:01.360 --> 29:03.694
let me know that they're okay.

29:03.696 --> 29:05.162
Look, your children
are in protective custody

29:05.164 --> 29:06.730
for a reason.
Yeah, I know.

29:06.732 --> 29:09.500
There are plenty of people
who would like to hurt me,

29:09.502 --> 29:11.368
who wouldn't hesitate
to target my kids

29:11.370 --> 29:14.004
just to see me suffer,
but as their mother,

29:14.006 --> 29:17.374
I deserve to know
how they're doing.

29:17.376 --> 29:19.710
You can use your connections
to Five-O to find out.

29:19.712 --> 29:21.578
Maybe get word
to them for me.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.147
That's never gonna happen.

29:23.149 --> 29:25.182
Excuse me?
The Feds aren't just

29:25.184 --> 29:27.484
protecting your children
from your rivals, Michelle.

29:27.486 --> 29:29.320
They're also protecting them
from you.

29:29.322 --> 29:31.722
And I'm not gonna
put them in danger

29:31.724 --> 29:33.357
by bringing you back
into their lives.

29:33.359 --> 29:36.760
You know, in spite
of his line of work,

29:36.762 --> 29:39.029
my father was
a very cautious man.

29:39.031 --> 29:41.832
That's why he had
large sums of money

29:41.834 --> 29:44.335
buried all over the island
before he was killed.

29:44.337 --> 29:47.037
A large portion
of that money

29:47.039 --> 29:49.540
once belonged to you.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.542
And I know where that's buried.

29:51.544 --> 29:55.145
You really think
that after all this time

29:55.147 --> 29:58.682
that money is the thing
that's gonna change my mind?

29:58.684 --> 30:00.751
We're done here.
No, no, wait.

30:00.753 --> 30:02.086
Wait.

30:02.088 --> 30:05.322
I know something
about you, Adam Noshimuri.

30:05.324 --> 30:09.159
Something that could change
your life forever.

30:11.397 --> 30:14.365
What was it that Shioma
had to tell you?

30:14.367 --> 30:16.266
My hunch is she was bluffing,
but...

30:16.268 --> 30:18.836
I'd rather not know what it was
than be in her debt.

30:18.838 --> 30:21.772
Which is what I told her
right before I walked out.

30:23.476 --> 30:24.675
Listen, Steve, I'm sorry.

30:24.677 --> 30:26.276
I should have come to you

30:26.278 --> 30:29.079
the minute her people
reached out to me.

30:30.883 --> 30:33.684
It's okay. I don't blame
you for going to see her.

30:33.686 --> 30:36.920
I'm just glad you
didn't take that bait.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.122
Adam.

30:38.124 --> 30:40.324
You know a guy
named Brandon Kenzo?

30:40.326 --> 30:43.127
Yeah. Yeah, I know Brandon.
He's a Yakuza lieutenant.

30:43.129 --> 30:44.762
Not anymore.

30:44.764 --> 30:46.630
Word is he's running
the organization

30:46.632 --> 30:47.664
now that Shioma's gone.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.366
We think he's the one
who killed her

30:49.368 --> 30:52.770
in order to assume full control
of the Honolulu faction.

30:52.772 --> 30:55.773
We also think that he's
the one responsible

30:55.775 --> 30:58.242
for this recent surge of
gang-on-gang violence.

30:58.244 --> 31:00.911
That's a bold play.
It is a bold play.

31:00.913 --> 31:02.546
Here's the problem--
he's gone to ground.

31:02.548 --> 31:03.881
We need to find him.

31:03.883 --> 31:07.885
Now, Adam, a guy like you,
with your connections...

31:07.887 --> 31:11.488
Look, if anyone can
find him, you can.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.924
You need my help, you got it.

31:20.466 --> 31:22.366
(knocks)

31:25.771 --> 31:28.305
Tell Mr. Kenzo Adam Noshimuri
is here to see him.

31:33.679 --> 31:35.212
Give me Saint Luke in the sixth.

31:35.214 --> 31:37.080
50 across the board.

31:39.718 --> 31:41.685
Adam Noshimuri.

31:41.687 --> 31:43.554
If I made a list
of all the people

31:43.556 --> 31:45.255
who I thought might
track me down here,

31:45.257 --> 31:46.590
you'd be at the bottom of it.

31:46.592 --> 31:47.891
Believe me, I'm
just as surprised

31:47.893 --> 31:49.560
as you to find
myself here.

31:49.562 --> 31:52.529
There's some business
we need to discuss.

31:52.531 --> 31:54.131
Sure.

31:54.133 --> 31:55.799
Okay.

31:58.838 --> 32:01.438
So, how'd you find me?

32:01.440 --> 32:03.707
Went to that
hostess bar on King.

32:03.709 --> 32:06.109
Spread some money around
with the girls.

32:06.111 --> 32:08.545
Didn't take long to find one
who had been by here.

32:08.547 --> 32:09.746
(chuckling)

32:09.748 --> 32:11.181
What can I say?

32:11.183 --> 32:13.617
A man has needs, right?

32:13.619 --> 32:16.253
You've been out of the game
a long time now.

32:16.255 --> 32:18.489
So, what is it
you want to talk about?

32:18.491 --> 32:20.858
The terms of your surrender.

32:21.694 --> 32:23.160
Come again?

32:25.831 --> 32:27.064
Easy.

32:27.066 --> 32:28.765
Your guys already
searched me at the door.

32:28.767 --> 32:30.367
Plus, you really think
I'd be dumb enough

32:30.369 --> 32:32.469
to walk in here strapped?

32:38.410 --> 32:42.746
Right now, Five-O, HPD and SWAT
have this place surrounded.

32:42.748 --> 32:46.016
And that's how long we have
before they move in here.

32:49.355 --> 32:50.621
Two minutes.

32:50.623 --> 32:53.524
Everybody, maintain position.
We breach on my command.

32:55.661 --> 32:57.861
In what universe
did you think

32:57.863 --> 33:00.264
leading the cops here
wouldn't end in me

33:00.266 --> 33:02.299
putting a bullet in your face?

33:02.301 --> 33:04.134
I'm doing you a favor here,
Brandon.

33:04.136 --> 33:06.703
Giving you an opportunity
to think your options through.

33:06.705 --> 33:09.106
You could kill me and go
down in a hail of bullets,

33:09.108 --> 33:11.074
or we can walk out
of here together

33:11.076 --> 33:13.710
and I'll make sure my
people are fair to you.

33:13.712 --> 33:15.913
Your people?

33:17.249 --> 33:19.716
One minute.

33:19.718 --> 33:22.252
There's cops everywhere.
What do you want us to do?

33:23.489 --> 33:24.855
There's only one play here.

33:24.857 --> 33:26.223
Choice seems simple to me.

33:26.225 --> 33:28.191
Says the guy
with a gun in his face.

33:28.193 --> 33:30.360
But seems to me there's
a whole range of options.

33:31.230 --> 33:33.497
Starting where I put
the first bullet.

33:34.633 --> 33:35.966
GROVER:
30 seconds.

33:36.835 --> 33:38.302
ADAM: You kill me,
you're guaranteed

33:38.304 --> 33:40.137
to spend the rest of
your life in prison.

33:40.139 --> 33:42.472
Assuming you make it
out of here alive.

33:42.474 --> 33:45.409
But if you give
yourself up, cooperate,

33:45.411 --> 33:48.679
with the lawyers you can afford,
you'll be out in no time.

33:48.681 --> 33:50.480
You got it all
figured out, don't you?

33:50.482 --> 33:51.815
You're smart,
Brandon.

33:51.817 --> 33:53.517
I wouldn't have risked my life
coming in here

33:53.519 --> 33:55.485
if I didn't think
you'd make the right decision.

33:56.322 --> 33:58.088
(chuckles softly)

34:00.392 --> 34:02.025
15 seconds.

34:02.795 --> 34:04.661
Copy.

34:12.170 --> 34:13.971
STEVE: Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

34:13.973 --> 34:16.005
Right now. Right now!

34:16.007 --> 34:17.206
Keep moving.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.809
Keep moving.
Let's go. Let's go.

34:18.811 --> 34:20.010
Let's go.

34:20.012 --> 34:22.245
Line up.

34:24.049 --> 34:26.683
Noshimuri assured me
a fair deal here.

34:26.685 --> 34:28.185
Did he?
Okay, well, that depends

34:28.187 --> 34:30.020
on what you've done,
Brandon, doesn't it?

34:30.022 --> 34:31.221
Michelle Shioma?

34:31.223 --> 34:32.856
She was my <i>oyabun.</i>

34:32.858 --> 34:34.992
I respected that.

34:34.994 --> 34:37.159
Her death had nothing
to do with me.

34:37.161 --> 34:38.261
Cool story, bro.

34:38.263 --> 34:40.330
Now, let me tell you
how that looks to us.

34:40.331 --> 34:42.431
Looks to us like,
as acting head of the Yakuza,

34:42.434 --> 34:45.302
you stood the most to gain
from her little...

34:45.304 --> 34:46.637
untimely accident in the shower.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.705
STEVE: But that was just
the beginning, wasn't it?

34:48.706 --> 34:51.708
You lit the fire that started
all this gang violence,

34:51.710 --> 34:53.342
and then you stepped back
and you watched

34:53.344 --> 34:55.478
all these rival territories
start tearing each other apart.

34:55.481 --> 34:57.414
GROVER: And when you're
the last man standing,

34:57.416 --> 34:58.849
you make your move,

34:58.851 --> 35:00.751
then you end up controlling
the whole damn thing.

35:00.753 --> 35:01.985
STEVE:
And the hit on Fischer,

35:01.987 --> 35:03.220
that was just you
pouring more gasoline

35:03.222 --> 35:04.221
on the fire, wasn't it?

35:04.223 --> 35:06.256
I mean, you knew
that law enforcement

35:06.258 --> 35:09.026
would clamp down on
every single faction out there.

35:09.028 --> 35:10.994
And with your men
off the street,

35:10.996 --> 35:13.463
you strengthen your position
while you weaken theirs.

35:13.465 --> 35:14.998
Well, that all makes
perfect sense.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.933
There's just one problem.

35:16.935 --> 35:18.035
What's that?

35:18.037 --> 35:19.302
None of it's true.

35:19.304 --> 35:22.906
I had nothing to do with
the hit on Michelle,

35:22.908 --> 35:25.909
but I was happy to let other
people think I did it.

35:25.911 --> 35:28.679
As for starting
all this violence,

35:28.681 --> 35:30.914
that's not on me
or my organization.

35:30.916 --> 35:32.182
GROVER: I suppose next
you're gonna tell us

35:32.184 --> 35:34.384
you had nothing to do
with the hit on Agent Fischer.

35:34.386 --> 35:36.486
Killing a Fed and his family?

35:36.488 --> 35:38.422
You'd have to be crazy
to want to bring

35:38.424 --> 35:39.623
that much heat on yourself.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.325
And whatever else
you may think of me,

35:42.327 --> 35:45.328
I'm not crazy.

35:46.165 --> 35:47.164
Let's take him in.

35:47.166 --> 35:49.132
Okay, time for jail.
Come on.

35:49.134 --> 35:50.500
Right this way.
(cell phone ringing)

35:50.502 --> 35:52.436
Got a nice room down there
for you downtown.

35:52.438 --> 35:54.237
Jerry, what's up?

35:54.239 --> 35:55.439
Boss, we got a problem.

35:56.275 --> 35:58.809
Someone just hit
the rendition facility.

35:58.811 --> 36:01.011
Jerry, what's going on?

36:01.013 --> 36:02.145
I'm counting eight hostiles.

36:02.147 --> 36:04.681
They're overpowering the guards.

36:04.683 --> 36:07.451
We got three...
no, make that four cops down.

36:07.453 --> 36:08.618
Hold on.

36:09.822 --> 36:12.923
It looks like they're starting
to open the cages.

36:12.925 --> 36:16.493
They're freeing Bautista, Cho,
Santos, Garcia.

36:16.495 --> 36:18.495
GROVER: Those are all
the high-value targets.

36:18.497 --> 36:20.764
STEVE: What are they doing
to them, Jerry?

36:20.766 --> 36:22.699
Jerry, what are they doing?
Oh, no.

36:22.701 --> 36:24.601
- What “oh, no”?
- They just cut the feed.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.295
(siren wailing)

36:36.297 --> 36:38.163
On your knees!
On your knees now!

36:42.570 --> 36:46.272
Get down! Lock your hands
behind your head!

37:12.099 --> 37:13.165
Jerry!

37:13.167 --> 37:14.533
We need backup!

37:14.535 --> 37:16.702
HPD and SWAT right now!
And EMTs.

37:16.704 --> 37:19.038
All available units.
Got it.

37:21.208 --> 37:23.175
Move! Move!

37:26.681 --> 37:27.913
(groans)

37:30.851 --> 37:31.917
(groans)

37:31.919 --> 37:33.519
STEVE:
Get an APB out

37:33.521 --> 37:36.255
on a late-model SUV
headed south

37:36.257 --> 37:38.424
on the Meheula Parkway
towards H2, and get birds

37:38.426 --> 37:39.758
up in the air right now.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.827
Roger that.
STEVE: Right now!

37:55.209 --> 37:56.575
Move in.
Move.

38:13.928 --> 38:15.794
Oh, no.

38:20.334 --> 38:23.602
GROVER: This is every
crime boss in town.

38:23.604 --> 38:26.138
(sirens wailing in distance)

38:28.242 --> 38:30.209
(sirens growing closer)

38:41.288 --> 38:43.389
Oh, God.

38:58.672 --> 39:00.572
Here you go.

39:00.574 --> 39:02.841
Mr. Bautista's
personal effects.

39:03.811 --> 39:05.644
Thank you.

39:05.646 --> 39:07.179
Are you sure you
want to do this?

39:07.181 --> 39:08.680
We can contact his next of kin.

39:13.888 --> 39:16.255
(grunts) No, I-I
know his mother.

39:16.257 --> 39:19.324
She should hear
it from me.

39:23.697 --> 39:26.198
How long has he been there?

39:27.034 --> 39:28.434
A while.

39:40.381 --> 39:42.214
Hey.

39:42.216 --> 39:45.684
Heard you checked yourself
out of the hospital.

39:47.655 --> 39:49.822
Could've done more.

39:49.824 --> 39:51.423
I should've told them
to take me in with them.

39:51.425 --> 39:52.424
I would've seen the danger.

39:52.426 --> 39:54.893
No. No.

39:54.895 --> 39:57.863
From what I understand,
you did more than anyone

39:57.865 --> 39:59.731
could have expected.

39:59.733 --> 40:01.867
Junior.

40:01.869 --> 40:04.403
Hey, this is not on you.

40:04.405 --> 40:06.572
Do you understand?

40:08.476 --> 40:10.676
Junior.

40:13.180 --> 40:14.246
Yeah.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.814
Come on. Let's go.

40:15.816 --> 40:17.850
I'm driving you home.

40:33.968 --> 40:35.167
Hey.

40:35.169 --> 40:36.335
Hey, buddy.

40:36.337 --> 40:37.569
Hey.

40:37.571 --> 40:39.338
Grab a seat.

40:40.141 --> 40:42.241
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

40:42.243 --> 40:45.010
Everything okay?

40:46.780 --> 40:48.747
(sighs)

40:51.619 --> 40:55.220
I haven't had a day as bad
as today for a long time.

40:56.590 --> 40:58.657
Just everything-- the way
it went down, you know?

40:58.659 --> 41:01.026
Rendition facility.

41:01.028 --> 41:05.230
The fact that whoever murdered
Agent Fischer, his wife,

41:05.232 --> 41:07.799
his six-year-old daughter...

41:07.801 --> 41:09.301
that person's still out there.

41:09.303 --> 41:10.536
They're not behind bars.

41:10.538 --> 41:12.671
They're not dead in a hole.

41:14.942 --> 41:17.142
I'm just having a little trouble
with it, you know.

41:17.144 --> 41:18.644
Yeah.

41:19.813 --> 41:22.648
Well, hey,
tomorrow's another day, Steve.

41:23.717 --> 41:25.617
(sighs)

41:27.021 --> 41:28.820
Yeah, it is.

41:29.557 --> 41:31.890
I want you to
see something.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.594
So, we I.D.'d
the dead shooters

41:35.596 --> 41:37.229
that hit the
rendition facility.

41:37.231 --> 41:39.765
All right, they were foreign
mercenaries out of Tokyo.

41:39.767 --> 41:43.001
Now, according to the Japanese
Criminal Affairs Bureau,

41:43.003 --> 41:45.237
these guys had
no affiliations with any

41:45.239 --> 41:46.238
established crews.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.372
They had no Yakuza ink.

41:47.374 --> 41:48.774
None of them had
any arrest records

41:48.776 --> 41:51.743
that tied back
to any syndicate crimes.

41:51.745 --> 41:54.446
So Kenzo was telling the truth--
this had nothing to do with him.

41:54.448 --> 41:56.114
It looks that way.

41:56.116 --> 41:57.349
I think it's safe to assume

41:57.351 --> 41:58.784
that whoever put
the rendition hit together

41:58.786 --> 42:02.020
also took out
Shioma and Fischer.

42:02.990 --> 42:05.190
Looks like there's
a new player on the scene

42:05.192 --> 42:06.992
and they don't like
competition.

42:06.994 --> 42:08.694
That's my guess.

42:08.696 --> 42:10.762
Right?
Yeah, you're chasing a ghost.

42:10.764 --> 42:13.232
No, Adam,
<i>we</i> are chasing a ghost.

42:13.234 --> 42:15.267
That's why I called
you here tonight.

42:15.269 --> 42:17.035
I need your help.

42:17.037 --> 42:19.004
I want you to head up
a special division

42:19.006 --> 42:21.173
within the Five-O Task Force

42:21.175 --> 42:24.776
that focuses solely on
organized crime on this island.

42:24.778 --> 42:26.345
Now, you got the connections.

42:26.347 --> 42:28.113
You know how
these guys think.

42:28.115 --> 42:30.082
You know how they act.

42:30.084 --> 42:32.584
I want you to help me find
who did all this.

42:32.586 --> 42:33.652
Now, listen.

42:33.654 --> 42:35.988
I know it's a lot
for me to ask you

42:35.990 --> 42:37.990
to walk back into that world...
No, Steve.

42:38.826 --> 42:40.492
You don't have to convince me.

42:44.031 --> 42:45.597
I'm in.
