And the Crows take the state championship! Ha ha.

00:19.917 --> 00:22.828
Well, I knew you were talented
I didn't know you could see the future.

00:22.829 --> 00:26.658
- I was just practicing.
- Oh, it's good to visualize game-winning plays,

00:26.659 --> 00:30.797
especially when the coach of Metropolis University
is coming to the game on Friday night,

00:30.798 --> 00:33.320
to check out the new star quarterback.

00:33.321 --> 00:35.475
- Are you kidding me?
- I don't kid about football.

00:35.476 --> 00:38.127
That's great, I...

00:38.756 --> 00:41.856
Are you Ok?

00:42.104 --> 00:46.765
Coach, I'll take care of him. Thanks for
stopping by, that's great news

00:47.229 --> 00:51.312
Clark... Clark, what's the matter son?

00:51.313 --> 00:53.907
- I hear ringing.
- Can you tell me where it's coming from?

00:53.908 --> 00:57.214
I need to go.

00:57.215 --> 00:59.516
Clark!

01:13.463 --> 01:18.110
You don't look well dad.
Forget to take your vitamins?

01:18.111 --> 01:20.703
I know how deeply angry you are Lex

01:20.704 --> 01:24.984
you let them put me in this God-forsaken
place because of that anger

01:24.985 --> 01:27.648
but it's too late to change anything now.

01:27.649 --> 01:33.481
So I've heard. A month left before
your liver gives up on you for good.

01:33.482 --> 01:38.361
What, you didn't think I would trek all the way
out here without having a chat with your doctor?

01:38.403 --> 01:43.569
I wanted to see you, Lex to say goodbye...
face-to-face.

01:45.466 --> 01:50.533
I have done many things in my life
that I have come to regret

01:51.074 --> 01:54.335
but there is one thing
I'll never forgive myself

01:57.237 --> 02:03.254
I never... said...

02:03.296 --> 02:07.239
I love you.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.183
Please.

02:35.414 --> 02:38.298
Lex don't!

03:01.578 --> 03:03.835
Clark?

03:10.879 --> 03:11.849
Right there.

03:11.850 --> 03:17.277
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

03:17.940 --> 03:19.838
Let me go!

03:19.839 --> 03:24.564
Let go of me! Lex! Lex!
Let go of me!

03:26.084 --> 03:28.689
What the hell are you doing here?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.167
Your father he... wanted to see me.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.787
Did he ask you to tackle me
to the floor while you're at it?

03:35.788 --> 03:37.633
He had something sharp, Lex...

03:37.634 --> 03:40.200
A knife.

03:40.201 --> 03:42.774
Let him go.

03:47.989 --> 03:51.321
Let's get out of here Lex.

03:51.411 --> 03:54.120
Now.

Original Airdate Oct. 27, 2004

04:58.960 --> 05:04.280
Clark, you don't seem like your usual self.
You barely said a word the entire ride home.

05:06.390 --> 05:10.076
Sorry.
Being in that prison...

05:10.077 --> 05:11.773
I guess it upset me.

05:11.774 --> 05:14.510
Yeah, well it isn't exactly
the happiest place on earth.

05:14.511 --> 05:17.838
No, it isn't Lex.

05:19.738 --> 05:21.926
Do you ever feel guilty?

05:22.861 --> 05:25.272
About sending your father to prison, I mean.

05:25.273 --> 05:28.834
Why would I?
The man murdered his parents.

05:29.882 --> 05:32.939
I did Society a favor.

05:34.104 --> 05:39.016
And that blood relationship,
it doesn't mean anything to you?

05:39.943 --> 05:44.169
Clark, since when did you become president
of my father's Fan club?

05:44.170 --> 05:48.585
You're right... of course.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.995
He's only your father.

05:54.090 --> 05:57.324
Why should you feel anything?

06:08.602 --> 06:10.770
Hey Clark.

06:11.810 --> 06:15.131
Dad.
Yeah, come on over here son.

06:15.470 --> 06:19.765
I'm glad you're back. Your mother and I
were really getting worried about you.

06:19.766 --> 06:23.613
Are you feeling all right?
I feel fine.

06:23.614 --> 06:29.506
That's a relief. It's never a good sign when
people around here start hearing strange noises.

06:29.507 --> 06:32.492
Look, since you're here, give me a hand.
Lift it on up.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.661
Lift?

06:34.662 --> 06:36.599
Lift what?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.085
The tractor.

06:38.086 --> 06:41.248
It's been giving me trouble all week, I need
to check out the rear end, come on.

06:41.249 --> 06:42.897
Lift it up.

06:46.337 --> 06:47.817
How would I do that?

06:47.818 --> 06:53.298
Very funny, Clark, but I don't have all day.
Lift up the tractor please, come on.

06:55.091 --> 06:57.483
Let's go!

07:12.425 --> 07:17.994
Really nice, but I'm not 5'4". Lift it up,
over your head, I need to get under the back.

07:29.403 --> 07:32.390
All right, that ought to do it.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.560
Of course.

07:39.242 --> 07:41.332
It all makes sense now...

07:41.333 --> 07:43.317
What's that?

07:43.318 --> 07:48.335
Oh... it's just...

07:48.336 --> 07:50.740
boy, is it dirty under here.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.149
Are you sure you're all right?

07:54.436 --> 07:58.978
Never felt better in my life.

08:19.989 --> 08:22.263
You must be Lex.

08:22.264 --> 08:26.026
Lex? No, I'm not Lex.
I'm Clark Kent.

08:26.027 --> 08:28.989
Houston, we have a problem.

08:28.990 --> 08:32.609
That Stone was meant for Lex.

08:34.484 --> 08:37.184
Where did Lionel get this?

08:37.186 --> 08:43.287
- Um... I don't know.
- Please, you have to tell me.

08:51.111 --> 08:55.866
It came from this Mayan rain god statue.

08:55.873 --> 08:59.133
One of his teams found it in an underwater
ruin off the coast of Honduras.

08:59.134 --> 09:01.316
How did he know to search there?

09:01.317 --> 09:05.442
Well he's scouring the globe. These ancient
symbols? They've shown up in Egypt...

09:05.443 --> 09:11.862
Central America, even a sacred Indian
cave right here in Kansas.

09:13.224 --> 09:16.884
These symbols, they look like they
mean something.

09:17.310 --> 09:21.879
You better believe it. The mark
on your stone right there, it means

09:21.880 --> 09:25.927
water. That's the element of,
you know, transformation.

09:25.928 --> 09:27.469
How do you know that?

09:27.470 --> 09:30.763
Well, I've always had a thing for
pattern recognition, codes,

09:30.764 --> 09:34.789
ciphers, that sort of thing. That one
means fire, and the other one up there

09:34.790 --> 09:38.906
that's air. So you take the three,
put them together...

09:38.907 --> 09:43.446
Mayan legend says it leads you to a trove
of knowledge beyond your wildest dreams

09:43.872 --> 09:48.640
I didn't believe any of this myself until,
58 minutes, 14 seconds ago

09:48.641 --> 09:53.331
when a myth about body jumping,
suddenly became... real.

09:55.909 --> 09:59.146
Hard to argue with it now,
stranger things have happened.

09:59.147 --> 10:00.864
What did you do to end up in here?

10:00.865 --> 10:06.228
If you ask the DA, I embezzled $14 million
from the Princeton University pension fund.

10:06.229 --> 10:08.799
- Did you do it?
- I'm a mathematician, I'm looking for

10:08.800 --> 10:12.697
hidden patterns in the Sea Scrolls,
money doesn't really mean a lot to me.

10:12.698 --> 10:16.247
You know what happened?
I was framed.

10:16.248 --> 10:20.526
And you just happened to end up in this
prison, in Lionel Luthor's cell?

10:20.527 --> 10:24.201
Yeah, that was pretty lucky, huh?
All I have to do is give him a hand

10:24.202 --> 10:27.674
with a couple of these symbols, and he
set me up with his lawyers.

10:27.675 --> 10:32.712
They're still trying to get me out of here,
I just hope he lasts long enough...

10:32.713 --> 10:35.065
What do you mean?

10:36.430 --> 10:38.477
He's dying.

10:38.854 --> 10:41.756
Yeah, he's dying.

10:43.055 --> 10:46.089
Mathematically speaking.

10:46.162 --> 10:51.781
If he's dying, then...
that means...

10:52.141 --> 10:54.371
I'm going to die.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.454
<i>Oui, Mademoiselle...</i>

10:57.479 --> 10:58.854
<i>Parlez vous engla√≠s?</i>

10:58.892 --> 11:01.834
<i>How may I help you sir?</i>

11:02.335 --> 11:04.933
This...

11:06.734 --> 11:09.271
This is Lionel Luthor.

11:09.459 --> 11:13.926
Account #434690 I'd like
to liquidate my account.

11:14.027 --> 11:18.065
My entire account, and purchase...

11:20.658 --> 11:22.711
Bearer bonds.

11:23.236 --> 11:26.756
<i>- Mother's Maiden name, Mr. Luthor.</i>
- Mehan.

11:26.838 --> 11:29.282
<i>And what is your...</i>

11:29.983 --> 11:34.398
<i>Oh I'm sorry Mr. Luthor, there seems to
be a problem with your voice verification.</i>

11:34.451 --> 11:36.221
What?

11:36.322 --> 11:38.298
<i>Clark!</i>

11:41.983 --> 11:43.414
Martha!

11:43.515 --> 11:48.690
I know you're practically a grown man Clark, but
please call me Mom no matter how old you are.

11:49.364 --> 11:50.999
Sure... Sure.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.300
Dinner's ready, but the way you're dressed
are you going out?

11:56.208 --> 12:02.784
Um, no, no, I just wanted a change,
I'm bored with plaid.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.716
Well, I'll see you inside.

12:10.941 --> 12:13.283
Clark? What are you doing?

12:13.284 --> 12:18.188
Well, I... I just...

12:20.344 --> 12:23.780
Wanted to tell you how beautiful you
look today...

12:24.862 --> 12:26.462
Mom.

12:26.463 --> 12:30.596
Something is not right...

12:30.597 --> 12:33.507
I can see it in your eyes.

12:34.983 --> 12:37.735
Is it because of that ringing you heard?

12:38.265 --> 12:40.764
I don't know.

12:43.998 --> 12:46.461
I need a hug.

12:58.558 --> 13:00.838
Clark!

13:05.709 --> 13:08.451
What's gotten into you?

13:08.856 --> 13:11.040
I, I don't know.

13:11.344 --> 13:13.411
Well, jump down there and put it out!

13:13.412 --> 13:15.709
Put it out?

13:16.352 --> 13:17.974
How?

13:18.228 --> 13:20.774
With your hands?

13:33.296 --> 13:35.324
Hey mom... hehehe.

13:36.612 --> 13:40.223
Hey! Hey, go upstairs and clean up!

13:40.224 --> 13:42.900
Hey Clark! Look who came to
check up on you.

13:42.901 --> 13:44.869
Hey.

13:50.707 --> 13:54.507
How are you feeling?
It's good to see you up and around.

13:54.508 --> 13:58.188
- I feel fine.
- You sure?

13:59.595 --> 14:03.514
Cause you're looking at me like you have
absolutely no idea who I am.

14:03.515 --> 14:08.915
No, I know who you are.
You're my... coach.

14:13.199 --> 14:16.743
Alright, well I guess I'll see you at
practice tomorrow.

14:16.890 --> 14:20.825
You know, I'm not going to be able
to make it.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.187
It's pretty important.

14:23.188 --> 14:26.062
Considering you could clinch a
scholarship on Friday.

14:26.063 --> 14:29.807
Coach, I just...
I need to rethink my priorities.

14:29.808 --> 14:31.978
I have no interest in football whatsoever.

14:31.979 --> 14:37.636
Whoa, Clark, hey. You realize that every
player on that roster would kill

14:37.637 --> 14:39.786
to be in your position. You get a free
ride to the college of your choice.

14:39.787 --> 14:41.463
You just want to quit the team?

14:41.464 --> 14:43.522
Precisely.

14:53.391 --> 14:58.029
Edgar, I've got to make a call.
How do I do that?

14:58.030 --> 15:01.272
Well, once a week, you get a turn, unless
you know how to work the system.

15:01.273 --> 15:03.036
Which of course I do.

15:03.037 --> 15:06.507
Edgar, please.
I need you to help me.

15:06.508 --> 15:07.834
What's in it for me?

15:07.835 --> 15:09.286
I can get you out of here.

15:09.287 --> 15:12.892
Come on, if the real Lionel Luthor can't do
it, what are you going to do?

15:12.893 --> 15:16.472
I mean, you have no money,
you have no power.

15:18.486 --> 15:22.314
I have a lot more power than you think.

15:22.455 --> 15:27.279
Time to play "Who Wants to
Beat a Billionaire"!

15:29.395 --> 15:32.149
Yeah, here we go now!

15:40.845 --> 15:42.188
You got my 5 large?

15:42.189 --> 15:45.590
What?

15:45.591 --> 15:46.879
What are you talking about?

15:46.880 --> 15:50.245
That senile act isn't going to work,
Trump. Payment's past-due.

15:50.246 --> 15:54.677
Things have changed. I don't have any
money. You'd have to...

16:00.307 --> 16:05.195
Don't play me, Trump. I'm doing
3 life terms for murder.

16:05.196 --> 16:08.125
What's one more?

16:09.381 --> 16:13.089
You got 'till tomorrow.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.721
Lex... changed the password.

16:46.437 --> 16:50.200
What, is flannel too "five minutes ago"?

16:52.365 --> 16:56.372
Whoa... who pulled a "Paul Bunyan"
on the desk?

16:56.373 --> 16:58.604
It was that way when I got here.

16:58.605 --> 16:59.716
Weird.

16:59.717 --> 17:03.188
You know, Chloe, I'm concerned
about your well being.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.280
Oh yeah?

17:04.281 --> 17:06.601
Why is that?

17:07.423 --> 17:12.429
If Lionel Luthor managed somehow to get
out of prison, what do you suppose he'd do?

17:12.430 --> 17:14.732
About you I mean.

17:14.733 --> 17:19.952
Why? Has the Lionel Luthor alert suddenly
been elevated to "orange"?

17:20.922 --> 17:24.279
Do you know something I don't?

17:26.675 --> 17:30.650
No...
But it always pays to be cautious.

17:30.651 --> 17:33.893
Well, I'm not exactly shaking in my
sneakers, I mean he won't be

17:33.894 --> 17:36.863
eligible for parole until he's like
112, so...

17:36.864 --> 17:41.102
You never know, he could get out
sooner than you think.

17:41.103 --> 17:45.710
Yeah well I think maybe our quarterback
has been sacked one too many times.

17:45.711 --> 17:48.314
Maybe...

17:48.722 --> 17:53.044
I do feel as though I'm looking through
a different pair of eyes.

17:53.045 --> 17:56.395
I certainly see you in a whole new light.

17:56.396 --> 17:58.920
Well, what exactly is that
supposed to mean?

17:58.921 --> 18:04.363
I have to confess that I... I find you
absolutely fascinating.

18:04.364 --> 18:08.711
It's that twinkle...
in your eye.

18:09.668 --> 18:13.806
Your wonderfully sexy smile.

18:14.657 --> 18:16.939
And your skin, it's...

18:16.940 --> 18:19.664
Clark, what are you doing?

18:19.665 --> 18:26.021
What I've wanted to do for a very...
very long time.

18:34.297 --> 18:37.820
Don't you wish...

18:40.295 --> 18:43.262
Miss Sullivan.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.851
I did some research on the
Countess Thoreaux.

18:53.852 --> 18:57.951
It turns out that we have a lot more in
common than I thought.

18:57.952 --> 19:01.137
Don't tell me the Countess ran
a coffee shop?

19:01.138 --> 19:07.038
No, she's from this village in France,
"<i>Casa Neaux de Momiralle</i>".

19:07.039 --> 19:11.185
Same village that my mom's ancestors
came from.

19:11.186 --> 19:12.489
Really.

19:12.490 --> 19:16.038
What do you think it all means?

19:16.670 --> 19:21.024
I don't know. It's all really strange.

19:21.099 --> 19:25.100
She was buried as a martyr... but,

19:27.232 --> 19:30.838
She was burned as a witch.

19:33.553 --> 19:40.195
Hey. We will figure this out.
I promise.

19:48.467 --> 19:51.525
Ladies.

19:51.562 --> 19:54.181
Not bad!

19:54.182 --> 20:00.420
You are my main concern, Lana. We'll get
through this Countess thing together.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.481
Oh please, don't stop on my account.

20:17.482 --> 20:18.593
Clark, it's...

20:18.594 --> 20:22.223
Oh, you don't have to explain yourself
to me... Lana.

20:22.224 --> 20:26.832
You're young... vital... you have needs.

20:26.833 --> 20:29.368
Right coach?

20:53.202 --> 20:55.331
What do you think?

20:55.332 --> 20:56.947
I wanted to thank you...

20:56.948 --> 21:00.723
For taking time out of your
busy schedule, Mr. Luthor.

21:00.724 --> 21:06.050
I understand how time-consuming
making license plates can be.

21:17.636 --> 21:20.925
You're not going to touch me with that
rock in your hand.

21:20.926 --> 21:25.980
You won't get near me.
Not with my... speed.

21:26.171 --> 21:27.654
You're never going to get away with this.

21:27.655 --> 21:31.135
Oh but I am. With my mind, and
your body...

21:31.136 --> 21:35.278
the sky's the limit... Clark.

21:37.419 --> 21:39.328
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:39.329 --> 21:43.285
You know it's becoming clear to me
why you're so secretive. You understand

21:43.286 --> 21:47.773
that true power is better left concealed.

21:48.350 --> 21:51.782
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be me.

21:51.783 --> 21:55.956
My parents... my friends...
they'll see right through you.

21:55.957 --> 22:00.147
I'm not so sure.
They haven't so far, have they?

22:00.148 --> 22:03.358
I need you to do something for me.

22:04.207 --> 22:08.799
Say the name "Mehan",
and these numbers...

22:09.833 --> 22:10.975
Why?

22:10.976 --> 22:15.482
Because if you don't,
your good friend Lex...

22:15.651 --> 22:19.218
will very shortly be dead.
An unfortunate accident...

22:19.219 --> 22:23.083
But he's your son!
Your only child!

22:23.084 --> 22:26.831
And I'm his only father. But that didn't
stop him from putting me in prison,

22:26.832 --> 22:29.059
and robbing me of everything I have.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.624
Now speak the words into the recorder

22:31.625 --> 22:35.297
or you will be directly responsible
for your friend's death.

22:40.436 --> 22:42.875
Your account number please.

22:42.876 --> 22:46.811
434690.

22:46.812 --> 22:49.771
May I please have your mother's maiden name?

22:49.772 --> 22:52.107
Mehan.

22:52.544 --> 22:56.020
Voice verification complete.

22:56.021 --> 22:59.347
Account balance is $2.59.

22:59.348 --> 23:03.352
No, no, there was 57 million
U.S. dollars in that account.

23:03.353 --> 23:07.844
A withdrawal for that amount
was made two months ago.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.747
The day I was convicted.

23:12.416 --> 23:15.980
Lex... of course.

23:15.981 --> 23:18.090
Clark?

23:20.251 --> 23:21.738
This one.

23:21.739 --> 23:25.149
About last night.
Um...

23:25.150 --> 23:29.149
I'm sorry that you found out about
me and Jason the way that you did.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.387
You'll get over it.

23:34.467 --> 23:39.465
We didn't just meet. He was in
Paris over the summer, and...

23:39.466 --> 23:42.911
we sort of...
spent a lot of time together.

23:42.912 --> 23:44.888
How romantic.

23:44.889 --> 23:49.476
Lovers meeting, first kiss shared
on the banks of the river <i>Sienne</i>.

23:51.967 --> 23:55.304
He moved to Smallville
to be with me, Clark.

23:55.305 --> 23:58.418
It's kind of serious.

24:02.206 --> 24:04.774
I'm not surprised.

24:07.759 --> 24:14.157
A man would travel around the world
to... pluck your succulent fruit.

24:14.617 --> 24:17.625
Don't talk to me like that.

24:18.248 --> 24:21.915
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

24:23.032 --> 24:26.076
Clark I need you to promise
me something.

24:26.077 --> 24:27.373
Whatever you want.

24:27.374 --> 24:31.875
Don't tell anyone
about me and Jason.

24:32.101 --> 24:36.216
I don't understand why you're so
interested in this high school football coach.

24:36.217 --> 24:37.661
Think a minute.

24:37.662 --> 24:40.032
Do you have any idea what
I have to offer you?

24:40.033 --> 24:43.093
Yeah, yeah I think I do.

24:43.094 --> 24:48.103
Lies, and secrecy, and a whole
lot of confusion.

24:48.228 --> 24:50.775
You're the one that broke up
with me, remember?

24:50.776 --> 24:55.550
Well that was a mistake, I was...
too young to know what I was doing

24:55.551 --> 24:58.837
I'm older now... more mature.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.367
Well I'm not so sure.

25:01.368 --> 25:05.014
Oh Lana I'm very different,
let me show you.

25:09.374 --> 25:13.343
Who the hell do you think you are?

25:17.230 --> 25:23.625
Clark Kent...
of course.

25:27.805 --> 25:32.058
Step in here, Miss.
Five minutes.

25:37.028 --> 25:38.490
I'm glad you came.

25:38.491 --> 25:42.505
I'm only here because you told me it
involves the safety of my son.

25:42.506 --> 25:46.360
I know this is hard to believe,
but I swear it's the truth.

25:48.572 --> 25:50.935
It's me Mom...
its Clark.

25:50.936 --> 25:53.384
You're sick, Lionel.
You need help.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.747
- Mom, you have to believe me.
- I'm leaving!

25:55.748 --> 26:00.031
Mom, mom, remember when I was 6,
and I was playing tag with Dad, and

26:00.032 --> 26:04.460
all of a sudden I started running
faster than I'd ever run before,

26:04.461 --> 26:06.825
and I was in the middle of Palmer
Woods, completely lost,

26:06.826 --> 26:09.716
and you and Dad had to call
Sheriff Ethan.

26:09.717 --> 26:12.165
And when you saw me
you started crying.

26:12.166 --> 26:15.047
And I thought something was wrong
with me, and you said "no there wasn't",

26:15.048 --> 26:19.442
and then you held me in your arms,
and you told me I was just special,

26:19.443 --> 26:22.097
I'm your special boy...

26:22.098 --> 26:23.950
Oh! Clark! How?

26:23.951 --> 26:29.122
The ringing I heard, it came from
a stone, it was in Lionel's hand,

26:29.728 --> 26:33.547
and it had a Kryptonian symbol on it,
and it was glowing,

26:33.548 --> 26:38.324
and I thought it was going to hurt
Lex, so I got in between them,

26:38.325 --> 26:43.355
and the next thing I know, I was... Lionel.

26:43.356 --> 26:45.993
I was in Lionel's body.

26:45.994 --> 26:48.187
And he knows about your powers.

26:48.188 --> 26:53.663
Mom, be careful.
Lionel could be anywhere.

26:56.724 --> 27:01.230
Crunching numbers?
Or spinning daydreams?

27:07.034 --> 27:09.690
I don't remember you being a Scotch drinker.

27:09.691 --> 27:13.899
It's very difficult to resist a
29 year-old Thailand.

27:16.809 --> 27:21.071
You know I had a feeling you'd pillage
your father's collection of single malts.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.860
Now how do you know it's
from my dad?

27:24.171 --> 27:25.940
Isn't it all your dad's?

27:25.941 --> 27:30.886
This castle? Luthorcorp, the cars,
the jets, everything

27:30.887 --> 27:34.324
to the very cuff-links
in your sleeves.

27:35.879 --> 27:40.999
Clark, I know you well enough to
realize this isn't you talking.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.663
You're absolutely right,
I'm not myself.

27:49.504 --> 27:52.585
I'm under stress.

27:54.125 --> 27:57.515
Lex, I need to get my hands on
$57 million dollars.

27:57.516 --> 28:00.216
That's an interesting dollar amount.

28:02.505 --> 28:05.546
It's not your money, you stole it.

28:05.547 --> 28:08.746
Now I want it back.

28:18.899 --> 28:22.435
Now get on the phone, tell the bank
to wire the money

28:22.436 --> 28:26.188
or I'll snap your larynx like a twig.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.199
- Go ahead, kill me.
- All I wanted was the best for you...

28:32.200 --> 28:34.549
and you destroyed me.

28:34.550 --> 28:37.422
Dad?

28:46.502 --> 28:48.976
Lex!

29:00.845 --> 29:02.010
Hello.

29:02.011 --> 29:04.259
I've been trying to reach you.
Where have you been?

29:04.260 --> 29:08.272
Hi sweetheart. I was at the mechanic's,
the tractor, I'm afraid it's shot.

29:08.273 --> 29:13.164
Jonathan, listen to me. You've got to go
to the closet and get a meteor rock.

29:13.165 --> 29:17.360
- What are you talking about Martha?
- Lionel is in Clark's body!

29:17.361 --> 29:20.480
I thought I was invulnerable now,
but I was wrong.

29:20.481 --> 29:22.075
Jonathan!

29:22.076 --> 29:27.965
- Tell me what weakens me. What is it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

29:40.301 --> 29:44.324
Tell me what it is, Jonathan.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.367
No Martha can't help you now,
tell me what it is!

29:47.368 --> 29:49.766
Hi, you've reached the Kents.
Leave a message.

29:49.767 --> 29:55.456
Does this thing work? Hello?
I'm calling for someone named Clark?

29:55.457 --> 29:58.763
Houston, we have a problem!

29:58.764 --> 30:03.708
I've done some more reading, and it's
not good, so I hope you're getting this,

30:03.709 --> 30:07.418
cause you should come see me,
A.S.A.P.

30:12.538 --> 30:15.946
- Is that really you in there Lionel?
- No, it's the Easter Bunny.

30:15.947 --> 30:18.254
What did you find, what did
the rest of the codes say?

30:18.255 --> 30:24.015
Turns out, the transference is
eventually going to come to an end.

30:24.016 --> 30:27.568
You will revert back to your
original bodies, eventually.

30:27.569 --> 30:30.259
- When?
- Suppose it could happen at anytime,

30:30.260 --> 30:32.287
Yeah, I thought you'd want
to know that.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.276
There must be some way to
make it permanent.

30:34.277 --> 30:37.222
Well, none that I see...

30:37.223 --> 30:39.632
Save murder.

30:40.179 --> 30:44.410
Theoretically speaking, if you were to
kill the other you, then

30:44.411 --> 30:49.078
there would be no "you" to revert back
to, so I suppose you could be Clark Kent

30:49.079 --> 30:53.529
for the rest of your life... his life,
your life, the difference is nil...

30:53.530 --> 30:56.334
The artifact, where is it?

30:56.335 --> 31:00.922
Guards took it from me, yeah
they thought it was a weapon.

31:09.539 --> 31:12.195
Time's up, Trump.
Got something for me?

31:12.196 --> 31:15.330
Yeah I'm still working on it.
Just give me a few more days.

31:15.331 --> 31:19.359
You think this is some kind of game?
There's no overtime here.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.475
But there is Sudden Death.

31:28.097 --> 31:30.973
Way to go, man!

31:43.762 --> 31:45.916
Get him!

31:57.388 --> 32:03.790
This is a lockdown! I repeat, this is a
lockdown! Return to your cells immediately!

32:15.625 --> 32:19.517
Go, go, go!

32:26.027 --> 32:31.150
Oh, that's no good. Listen your lawyers,
they haven't been calling so...

32:31.151 --> 32:34.084
should I call you?

33:30.207 --> 33:33.552
What happened to concealing your powers?

33:33.553 --> 33:36.209
Sorry, only one Clark allowed.

33:36.210 --> 33:42.344
What are you going to do? Go to High
School? Stack hay for the rest of your life?

33:42.345 --> 33:47.607
A farm boy? I don't think so.
I have big plans for this "Clark Kent."

35:10.983 --> 35:14.407
What else did Lionel do?

35:14.760 --> 35:18.729
Well, for starters...
you quit the football team.

35:18.993 --> 35:21.151
I better call coach Teague.

35:21.352 --> 35:26.886
He's not the only one. Lana and Chloe came
to see you and they both looked pretty upset.

35:27.214 --> 35:29.819
Before I do any of that, I've
got to get that artifact

35:29.830 --> 35:32.230
Clark, I don't want you going
anywhere near that prison, son.

35:32.235 --> 35:33.555
If I don't find it, Lionel could.

35:33.560 --> 35:37.261
You can't risk having the same thing
happen to you all over again.

35:38.363 --> 35:42.034
Look, this isn't the first time
I heard the ringing sound.

35:42.322 --> 35:46.593
When I was Kal-El, I heard the same
sound, and it led me to an artifact with

35:46.594 --> 35:50.075
a Kryptonian symbol on it, in Lex's jet.

35:50.076 --> 35:52.170
Where's the artifact now, Clark?

35:52.171 --> 35:55.805
I put it in a chamber in the cave wall.
There's a slot for two more, and.

35:55.806 --> 35:58.388
Lionel's artifact matches one of them.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.097
I don't know where the other one is.

36:00.098 --> 36:02.933
Why didn't you tell us about this earlier?

36:02.960 --> 36:05.485
With everything we've been through
with Jor-El, I just wanted to

36:05.494 --> 36:08.462
close that chapter in my life.

36:08.878 --> 36:12.222
Guess it doesn't matter what I want.

36:13.668 --> 36:16.347
Look, these artifacts. I think
they're somehow meant for me.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.896
And I think Lionel Luthor would disagree
with that, don't you?

36:18.897 --> 36:22.340
And now that he knows about your powers,
he's more dangerous than ever.

36:22.341 --> 36:24.321
Not for long.

36:24.322 --> 36:25.926
Clark, what are you talking about?

36:25.927 --> 36:29.485
Lionel Luthor's dying, Dad.

36:32.821 --> 36:35.891
It couldn't be...

36:35.892 --> 36:40.683
Doctor, please just... tell me.

36:41.380 --> 36:47.487
Mr. Luthor, your liver is
entirely disease-free.

36:52.985 --> 36:54.934
How can that be possible?

36:54.935 --> 36:56.737
I have no idea.

36:56.738 --> 36:59.857
It's the closest thing to a miracle
I've ever seen.

36:59.858 --> 37:03.478
Have you been taking any unregulated
meds... supplements?

37:03.479 --> 37:06.825
No.
Not that I know of.

37:06.826 --> 37:11.880
You must understand I have no recollection
of the past few days, Doctor, I just...

37:11.881 --> 37:18.092
know that, something... here, something,

37:18.227 --> 37:23.149
inside of me, has changed.

37:24.829 --> 37:27.219
Profoundly.

37:27.220 --> 37:32.442
I'm not... the same man.

37:38.028 --> 37:41.155
Chloe, listen I'm not really sure
what I did to you.

37:41.156 --> 37:43.169
Another convenient case
of amnesia, huh?

37:43.170 --> 37:45.166
No, but whatever it is,
I'm really sorry.

37:45.167 --> 37:47.906
Clark, you know what? It's a really
valiant effort, but you've used up

37:47.907 --> 37:50.329
your lifetime allotment
of apologies.

37:50.330 --> 37:53.631
Look. I'm only saying this to you because
I care about you, but I think you should

37:53.632 --> 37:55.947
go and look for help.

37:55.948 --> 37:58.748
Some psychological help.

37:58.749 --> 38:00.833
Chloe, I totally appreciate you
looking out for me,

38:00.834 --> 38:02.931
but I really don't think
I need to talk to anyone.

38:02.932 --> 38:06.178
Well then how are you going to explain
all of this, Clark Kent "Crackhead"?

38:06.179 --> 38:08.527
Chloe, I don't do drugs,
look it wasn't me!

38:08.528 --> 38:11.837
Yeah, but see Clark, it was you!
Now a lot of people in this town have

38:11.838 --> 38:15.981
pulled a "Jeckyl and Hyde" but deep down,
they're still the same person.

38:16.606 --> 38:20.078
Lana. He's all yours.

38:21.282 --> 38:24.325
Have you said anything to anyone?

38:25.040 --> 38:27.706
- What?
- Don't play games with me, Clark.

38:27.707 --> 38:31.197
Seriously Lana, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:31.198 --> 38:34.356
This isn't about you and me, alright?

38:34.357 --> 38:37.303
This is about Jason losing his job.

38:37.304 --> 38:39.156
Why would Jason lose his job?

38:39.157 --> 38:43.864
Why do you think? If anyone had the
slightest inkling that we were a couple,

38:43.865 --> 38:46.904
he'd be fired in a heartbeat.

38:46.905 --> 38:48.678
You and Jason?

38:48.679 --> 38:51.588
We're both adults, and we're
not hurting anybody.

38:51.589 --> 38:54.838
But the school has it's rules.

38:55.445 --> 38:58.451
He needs this job, Clark.

38:58.816 --> 39:02.161
Please, after everything
you've put me through,

39:02.170 --> 39:05.282
can you at least
keep this a secret?

39:07.149 --> 39:11.234
It seems to be the one thing
that you're good at.

39:12.069 --> 39:14.622
Yeah.

39:27.628 --> 39:29.192
Lex!

39:29.193 --> 39:32.425
Stay where you are!

39:34.349 --> 39:36.708
Lex, it's me, Clark.

39:36.709 --> 39:38.048
I need to talk to you.

39:38.049 --> 39:41.669
After I drove my Porsche into the river
and you fished me out, I asked your Dad

39:41.670 --> 39:45.368
if there was any way I could repay him.
What'd he say that we always joke about?

39:45.469 --> 39:46.754
Lex, what is this, a pop quiz?

39:46.755 --> 39:48.981
Answer the question!

39:50.966 --> 39:53.499
He told you to drive slower.

39:57.023 --> 40:00.331
Welcome back.

40:05.606 --> 40:08.997
So you know what happened?

40:09.506 --> 40:14.469
Well, it was a bit of a giveaway when you
asked for $57 million dollars.

40:17.245 --> 40:20.141
Lex, my mom told me what I did,
and I'm sorry.

40:20.142 --> 40:23.609
Clark, if you didn't come between me and
my father in that visiting room,

40:23.610 --> 40:27.323
it would've been me sitting behind bars.
I should be thanking you.

40:27.324 --> 40:31.362
I didn't do anything you wouldn't
have done for me.

40:34.421 --> 40:37.452
So how did my father do it?

40:37.453 --> 40:40.249
I... I don't know.

40:41.054 --> 40:45.508
That strength you had.
It was incredible.

40:45.509 --> 40:48.545
Where did it come from?

40:48.988 --> 40:53.257
Um, must have been a side effect
of the transference.

40:53.258 --> 40:57.554
Well, whatever happened,
I'm just glad it wore off.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.840
Lex, I have a favor to ask.

40:59.841 --> 41:01.720
Name it.

41:01.721 --> 41:04.285
Well, it has to do with your
father's cellmate.

41:04.286 --> 41:09.668
He's actually the one that helped me
through this whole ordeal, he saved my life.

41:09.946 --> 41:12.371
He swears he was framed.

41:12.372 --> 41:15.806
Clark, a lot of convicts swear
they've been framed.

41:15.807 --> 41:20.509
But I believe him. And I promised him
that if I got out, I'd do everything in

41:20.510 --> 41:23.863
my power to help him. And Lex, you're the
only one I know with the resources

41:23.864 --> 41:26.971
that might be able to help.

41:29.984 --> 41:34.155
Well, if I can manage to put a
guilty man in prison...

41:34.156 --> 41:37.769
maybe I can get an innocent man out.

42:09.421 --> 42:11.501
I was told that it was going to be..

42:11.502 --> 42:13.707
- Edgar.
- Yes?

42:13.708 --> 42:16.838
Do you have what we asked you for?

42:20.382 --> 42:22.910
Thank you.

42:29.025 --> 42:31.847
Nice car.
