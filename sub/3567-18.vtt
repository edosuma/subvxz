WEBVTT

00:03.765 --> 00:06.233
- Oomph!
- Whoa!

00:06.301 --> 00:08.970
- Ugh! You okay, Steven?
- Uh!

00:09.037 --> 00:11.539
- I've seen better days.
- Pearl, I got a boo-boo.

00:11.606 --> 00:17.244
- Oh, walk it off.
- Here it comes.

00:17.346 --> 00:20.915
- You all distract it!
- Let's show this thing what we're made of, guys!

00:21.016 --> 00:25.052
What do you think we've
been doing for the past hour?

00:25.120 --> 00:29.223
- Duck!
- Huh?

00:29.291 --> 00:33.127
- Man, I don't see any d... Quack!
- Steven's turn!

00:35.119 --> 00:38.899
- Yup! It's got spikes!
- It's okay!

00:38.967 --> 00:45.589
- Here comes Garnet!
- Smash that puff!

00:51.513 --> 00:56.166
- Aw, man! We blew it!
- Ugh, whatever!

01:01.849 --> 01:02.845
<i>Amethyst!</i>

01:02.880 --> 01:06.761
Smacking it really far away doesn't
solve anything! We needed to destroy it.

01:06.828 --> 01:11.709
- Now it's just gonna come back later.
- Yeah, so we'll deal with it later.

01:11.744 --> 01:13.868
- Ugh.
- Let's get Garnet.

01:13.935 --> 01:15.736
She landed by the boardwalk.

01:16.472 --> 01:19.340
Would you answer me?!
You've wrecked my sign and now

01:19.408 --> 01:23.978
you're just sitting up there! Are we
engaged in a secret staring contest?!

01:24.079 --> 01:27.381
- Garnet! Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:27.449 --> 01:31.152
- Hi, Steven.
- This place is wrecked!

01:31.219 --> 01:34.422
- Give me one down low.
- No accolades for you, Amethyst.

01:34.489 --> 01:38.125
- She knocked the puffer fish back out into the ocean!
- Narc!

01:38.193 --> 01:41.962
- Let's regroup back at the temple.
- Where are you going?

01:42.030 --> 01:43.981
What about my sign? Steven!

01:43.982 --> 01:47.188
What is wrong with your friends?
One of them busts up my sign,

01:47.223 --> 01:51.238
then they all just jump into the
sky like some circus act without

01:51.306 --> 01:54.684
- even offering to help!
- But, Mr. Pizza!

01:54.685 --> 01:59.413
- Dad, pipe down!
- Oh! Did I interrupt your beauty sleep?

01:59.481 --> 02:01.949
I don't need sleep to look pretty.

02:02.017 --> 02:05.152
- Now you listen here, young woman!
- Kofi, you are going to wake

02:05.253 --> 02:09.824
this fish from the dead with all the
noise you're keeping. Oh! Too late.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.566
"Kofi, you so loud!
Aaaaah!" Bleh.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.834
Gunga, you're so funny.

02:16.835 --> 02:21.296
Mom, quit joking around!
Look what they did to my sign!

02:21.369 --> 02:26.251
- Cheese on bread!
- Can you believe it? You're such a nice boy, Steven.

02:26.286 --> 02:29.677
- Why do you hang out with those animals?
- They're not animals!

02:29.712 --> 02:31.856
They're the Crystal Gems
and they protect humanit...

02:31.911 --> 02:34.109
I've heard enough!

02:34.616 --> 02:39.920
- Hey, girls, I think I hear all of our cellphones ringing.
- Gunga, your hearing is so good.

02:39.988 --> 02:44.058
Steven, you can tell your
friends that they are officially

02:44.126 --> 02:50.865
- banned from Fish Stew Pizza!
- Wait! What?! Kofi, that's not fair!

02:50.932 --> 02:53.067
<i>This was just an accident!</i>

02:55.871 --> 03:00.074
- What if we just, like, let it roam free?
- That's not an option.

03:00.142 --> 03:03.310
- Hey, Steven.
- I've got bad news, everyone.

03:03.411 --> 03:09.883
- You've all been banned from Fish Stew Pizza.
- Oh! Uh, that's okay.

03:09.918 --> 03:13.721
- That pizza wasn't even good.
- Aren't you guys upset about this?

03:13.756 --> 03:16.612
- Not at all.
- But these are our neighbors.

03:16.647 --> 03:18.526
<i>There's nothing
we can do about that now.</i>

03:18.593 --> 03:21.996
Right now we have to figure out
a way to take care of that puffer fish.

03:22.063 --> 03:25.154
What's the point of saving people
if they're just gonna ban you

03:25.252 --> 03:28.169
- from their pizza shops?
- We don't do it for thanks.

03:28.236 --> 03:30.517
Yeah, see?
That is so nice of you!

03:30.518 --> 03:34.482
The pizzas don't even know!
If they got to spend some time with you,

03:34.483 --> 03:38.045
they'd see how fun and
smart and mysterious you are.

03:38.113 --> 03:41.365
- Heh. Mysterious.
- Hmm.

03:41.366 --> 03:44.776
I know!
I'll throw a little party on the beach

03:44.811 --> 03:46.996
in front of the temple!
Just us and the pizzas!

03:47.031 --> 03:48.699
I don't know, Steven.
I mean ...

03:48.734 --> 03:50.791
Don't worry!
I'll take care of everything!

03:54.429 --> 03:58.645
Man, this is gonna be so good!

03:58.680 --> 04:00.933
- Hey, Steven.
- Hey!

04:00.968 --> 04:04.765
- Got everything ready for your little party?
- Yeah. There's one more thing.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.108
- What's this for?
- I was thinking you guys could change your outfits.

04:08.176 --> 04:11.378
- What's wrong with what we have on now?
- Nothing!

04:11.446 --> 04:15.349
<i>- I just thought it would be nice to go kind of casual.
- Is this the right address?</i>

04:15.417 --> 04:17.817
<i>I've never seen this
side of the beach before.</i>

04:17.819 --> 04:21.166
Oh, man, they're here.
Hurry up and change.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.793
<i>Over here, everyone! Hi!</i>

04:22.828 --> 04:25.048
- Hey, Steven.
- Hello.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.828
- How're you all doing today?
- The shop is closed today

04:27.896 --> 04:34.902
- because it's broken.
- Uh... uh, oh! That sounds, uh...

04:34.970 --> 04:36.460
Hey, do I smell hot dogs?

04:36.461 --> 04:39.440
- Show me where the hot dogs are.
- Oh!

04:39.507 --> 04:40.741
Right this way, everyone.

04:40.742 --> 04:46.056
- First, let me introduce ...
- We are the Crystal Gems!

04:46.091 --> 04:51.085
- # Garnet #
- # Amethyst #

04:51.086 --> 04:55.089
- # Pearl #
- And Steven!

04:55.156 --> 04:58.065
But you already knew my name.

04:58.066 --> 05:03.334
- Oh! You're all so talented!
- So, you are a circus act.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.668
- Circus act?
- Hey, let's eat!

05:07.269 --> 05:10.471
- Everything came out great.
- Thanks, Kiki.

05:10.472 --> 05:13.908
Aren't you girls hungry?
You barely touched your food.

05:13.909 --> 05:17.444
- We don't need to eat.
- Oh, you young people and your

05:17.545 --> 05:21.714
- experimental diets.
- I am much older than you.

05:21.983 --> 05:28.123
- So, you all live in that tiny house up on that hill?
- We inhabit the inner sanctums only

05:28.158 --> 05:33.227
- accessible through magical extradimensional doors.
- What is wrong with your hand?

05:33.295 --> 05:36.330
- Why's this place look like it's falling apart?
- Well, the temple has

05:36.398 --> 05:40.100
- been here for thousands of years.
- Oh, I see how it is.

05:40.168 --> 05:43.415
When something breaks around
here, you just leave it alone,

05:43.416 --> 05:46.329
- just like the sign at my shop!
- Um...

05:46.364 --> 05:49.255
Who wants to play volleyball?

05:50.404 --> 05:53.175
Okay, everyone, the court is all set.

05:53.210 --> 05:56.769
- Now to get into our teams.
- But, Steven, won't our

05:56.804 --> 06:00.818
- abilities give us an unfair advantage?
- That's why I'm picking the teams.

06:01.032 --> 06:03.363
<i>♪ Amethyst and Jenny! ♪</i>

06:03.727 --> 06:05.726
<i>♪ Pearl and Kiki! ♪</i>

06:05.827 --> 06:10.114
♪ Garnet and Kofi! ♪
and last but not least ...

06:10.184 --> 06:14.272
♪ yours truly and Nanefua! ♪

06:14.302 --> 06:18.072
I haven't played in ages, but I
bet I could whoop all your butts.

06:18.139 --> 06:23.444
That's the spirit.
You guys ready? Let's play!

06:23.545 --> 06:25.746
Hope you're
ready to lose, Pearl!

06:25.747 --> 06:28.950
There's no way I'd
lose to someone like you!

06:28.951 --> 06:32.286
- Here we come!
- Hyah!

06:32.354 --> 06:36.090
- Nice one, Kiki!
- And pow!

06:36.157 --> 06:39.827
- Amethyst, no kicking!
- Psh! What kind of game is this?

06:39.928 --> 06:44.826
- Nicely done, Kiki.
- Try and stick to the rules, Amethyst.

06:44.861 --> 06:47.868
- Try harder, Jenny.
- Here it comes.

06:47.969 --> 06:52.172
- Ugh! Come on, Jenny!
- What? I'm not doing anything.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.042
- Ha! My move!
- Yes!

06:55.110 --> 06:59.764
- That was uncalled for, Amethyst.
- You afraid of gettin' a little sand

06:59.799 --> 07:03.891
- in your hair, Kiki?
- No, just trying to keep tidy.

07:03.926 --> 07:06.674
There's nothing wrong
with trying to keep tidy.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.021
- So exciting!
- Yeah!

07:08.089 --> 07:10.555
- Our turn.
- I'm ready.

07:10.590 --> 07:13.861
- I got this one.
- Jennifer, you touch that ball, you're grounded!

07:13.862 --> 07:18.860
- Whoa! Daddy, you cheatin'!
- The look on your face!

07:18.895 --> 07:22.725
- This is going to be easy.
- It'd be nice if they stuck to the basics.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.073
Take this, Garnet.
Hyah!

07:26.141 --> 07:28.563
Huuuur! Hyah!

07:29.643 --> 07:31.145
We should probably move, huh?

07:31.212 --> 07:34.448
- Yeah, we should.
- Oh! Oh, geez!

07:34.516 --> 07:39.326
- You're all running like wild chickens!
- Whoa!

07:39.788 --> 07:44.091
Did you know that when sand is
superheated, it turns into glass?

07:44.159 --> 07:48.862
I did not know that.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.447
- Whoa.
- Let's play!

07:50.448 --> 07:52.689
- Aah!
- Whoo!

07:52.724 --> 07:55.810
- Amethyst!
- Hyah!

07:57.388 --> 07:59.840
<i>Over here, Amethyst.
Over here!</i>

08:01.343 --> 08:03.631
- Kofi time!
- Jenny time!

08:03.666 --> 08:07.247
- You can't use the car for a month!
- Daddy!

08:07.315 --> 08:10.317
- Why are you cheating so much?
- You cheated first.

08:10.385 --> 08:13.454
- That is not true.
- This is getting out of hand.

08:13.521 --> 08:16.886
I'll run and get the ball.

08:20.735 --> 08:25.863
Hey, why's it getting so... windy?!

08:25.898 --> 08:26.765
Ah, no! It's back!

08:26.766 --> 08:30.961
- Puffer fish monster's back!
- What's all the ...

08:30.996 --> 08:34.304
- Nanefua, run!
- We should win 'cause we're the best.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.755
- Y'all cheated!
- Cheaters!

08:35.789 --> 08:36.903
- You're out of line.
- Everyone is grounded here.

08:37.062 --> 08:39.046
- Garnet!
- Steven!

08:39.147 --> 08:45.276
- Oh, no! Gems, protect the Pizzas!
- Hey! What is going on?!

08:46.268 --> 08:49.957
This is terrible. I was trying to
get everyone together,

08:50.058 --> 08:53.371
- but now everyone's in danger.
- I'm not afraid of that thing.

08:53.372 --> 08:56.272
Let's see if you can keep up with me!

08:56.273 --> 08:58.025
Of course I can!

08:58.295 --> 09:00.315
Over here!

09:00.350 --> 09:04.244
<i>No! Over here! Come on!</i>

09:04.245 --> 09:06.840
Oh, my gosh! Steven!

09:06.908 --> 09:11.322
- What are they doing?
- Everybody, get ready!

09:11.357 --> 09:15.544
- Mom, you are crazy!
- Not crazy. Brave.

09:15.545 --> 09:18.939
Gunga, careful with your back!

09:18.974 --> 09:23.599
- Amethyst, turn yourself into a ball!
- Okay!

09:23.825 --> 09:30.497
- Jenny, roll Amethyst to the net and then hold on!
- Sure thing!

09:30.565 --> 09:37.337
- Pearl, head over to Jenny and Amethyst!
- Yes, ma'am!

09:37.405 --> 09:41.264
Hit Amethyst into the
air as hard as you can!

09:41.299 --> 09:42.737
With pleasure.

09:44.856 --> 09:49.195
Kofi, Kiki, get over to the net.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.414
<i>Garnet, spike the beach!</i>

09:51.449 --> 09:56.423
- I understand.
- Be gentle.

09:56.491 --> 10:00.027
- I'll try.
- Yowch!

10:04.972 --> 10:09.570
- Here comes the tricky part.
- I'm ready!

10:09.637 --> 10:13.818
Everyone, take the net to
the other side of the court.

10:13.819 --> 10:19.935
Okay, everyone, pull
the net into its face!

10:21.831 --> 10:26.088
- It's not enough!
- Don't worry! Here comes Garnet!

10:29.257 --> 10:31.872
- Thanks for your hospitality.
- And?

10:31.907 --> 10:33.984
And for saving my family.

10:34.019 --> 10:36.897
You are all officially unbanned from my shop.

10:36.965 --> 10:39.231
Aww! Thank you so much, Kofi!

10:39.232 --> 10:41.497
We really appreciate it, right, guys?

10:41.532 --> 10:44.341
- Okay. Yes. Thanks.
- Aaaand?

10:44.376 --> 10:47.841
- What were we banned from again?
- Ehh.
