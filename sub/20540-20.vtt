>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.367 --> 00:35.066
WELCOME TO

00:35.066 --> 00:36.500
"LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.500 --> 00:41.734
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.734 --> 00:42.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:42.567 --> 00:43.433
US.

00:43.433 --> 00:44.333
MUCH LIKE THE DISINTEGRATION OF

00:44.333 --> 00:45.166
WESTERN CIVILIZATION, WE BEGIN

00:45.166 --> 00:46.633
TONIGHT WITH DONALD TRUMP.

00:46.633 --> 00:47.600
THE DONALD TRUMP JR. OF AMERICAN

00:47.600 --> 00:49.967
PRESIDENTS.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.667
AND IF, AROUND 5:00 P.M. ON

00:51.667 --> 00:53.367
FRIDAY, YOU SUDDENLY STARTED

00:53.367 --> 00:55.467
FEELING A LITTLE CALMER, IT MAY

00:55.467 --> 00:57.000
BE BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.934
>> TONIGHT, PRESIDENT DONALD

00:57.934 --> 00:59.166
TRUMP IS GETTING AWAY FROM THE

00:59.166 --> 01:00.633
WASHINGTON HEAT.

01:00.633 --> 01:01.767
THE PRESIDENT ARRIVED IN NEW

01:01.767 --> 01:02.867
JERSEY JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO

01:02.867 --> 01:04.500
TO BEGIN A SEVENTEEN DAY

01:04.500 --> 01:05.567
VACATION.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.834
>> John: YES, TRUMP IS TAKING A

01:07.834 --> 01:09.100
17-DAY VACATION FROM WORK WHICH

01:09.100 --> 01:13.433
MEANS, MORE IMPORTANTLY, AMERICA

01:13.433 --> 01:14.166
MAY BE GETTING A 17-DAY VACATION

01:14.166 --> 01:15.967
FROM TRUMP.

01:15.967 --> 01:18.600
WHICH IS EXCITING, RIGHT?

01:18.600 --> 01:20.800
ALTHOUGH, WHILE HE'S THERE,

01:20.800 --> 01:21.900
HE'LL STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:21.900 --> 01:22.967
NUCLEAR CODES, AND, EVEN WORSE,

01:22.967 --> 01:25.467
WI-FI, SO DON'T RELAX.

01:25.467 --> 01:26.367
NEVER RELAX.

01:26.367 --> 01:28.567
YOUR LIFE IS A TORTURE CHAMBER

01:28.567 --> 01:30.400
OF FEAR AND PANIC.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.934
BUT THAT WAS FRIDAY, AND TRUMP

01:31.934 --> 01:33.233
WAS LEAVING AT THE END OF WHAT

01:33.233 --> 01:34.333
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD DUBBED

01:34.333 --> 01:35.300
"AMERICAN DREAM WEEK,"

01:35.300 --> 01:36.567
WHICH TRUMP CHOSE TO MARK BY

01:36.567 --> 01:38.300
DEMEANING AS MANY AMERICAN

01:38.300 --> 01:39.533
INSTITUTIONS AS HE POSSIBLY

01:39.533 --> 01:42.567
COULD, BEGINNING WITH THIS.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.767
>> AFTER THAT POLITICAL SPEECH

01:44.767 --> 01:45.700
TO THE BOY SCOUTS LAST WEEK, THE

01:45.700 --> 01:47.033
PRESIDENT TOLD

01:47.033 --> 01:48.734
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"

01:48.734 --> 01:50.100
THE HEAD OF THE BOY SCOUTS

01:50.100 --> 01:52.233
PERSONALLY CALLED HIM TO SAY IT

01:52.233 --> 01:53.567
WAS THE GREATEST SPEECH THAT WAS

01:53.567 --> 01:55.000
EVER MADE TO THEM AND THEY WERE

01:55.000 --> 01:56.834
VERY THANKFUL.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.233
BUT ACTUALLY, THE SPEECH ANGERED

01:58.233 --> 01:59.667
SO MANY, THE BOY SCOUTS WERE

01:59.667 --> 02:01.834
FORCED TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY AND

02:01.834 --> 02:03.133
YESTERDAY THEY SAID THERE WAS NO

02:03.133 --> 02:05.033
PHONE CALL.

02:05.033 --> 02:05.800
>> John: OKAY, SO LET ME GET

02:05.800 --> 02:07.266
THIS STRAIGHT.

02:07.266 --> 02:08.667
TRUMP SHOWED UP, SAID A BUNCH OF

02:08.667 --> 02:09.934
CRAZY SHIT, THEN LIED TO MAKE

02:09.934 --> 02:12.433
HIMSELF LOOK GOOD.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.800
I'M NOT SURE WHY THE BOY SCOUTS

02:14.800 --> 02:16.867
ARE SO UPSET.

02:16.867 --> 02:17.633
YOU BOOKED TRUMP AND YOU GOT

02:17.633 --> 02:18.734
TRUMP.

02:18.734 --> 02:19.800
YOU CAN'T BOOK GALLAGHER AND

02:19.800 --> 02:20.867
THEN SUDDENLY COMPLAIN WHEN

02:20.867 --> 02:21.900
YOU GO HOME COVERED IN MELON

02:21.900 --> 02:23.500
JUICE.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.633
IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HIS

02:27.633 --> 02:29.000
ACT BY NOW, IT'S KIND OF ON YOU.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.834
BUT TRUMP WAS JUST GETTING

02:29.834 --> 02:30.567
STARTED.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.367
EVEN AS THAT CONTROVERSY WAS

02:31.367 --> 02:32.533
STILL GOING, A NEW ONE EMERGED.

02:32.533 --> 02:33.500
>> ACCORDING TO

02:33.500 --> 02:34.934
"SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"'S

02:34.934 --> 02:36.033
Golf.com, PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:36.033 --> 02:37.200
EXPLAINED TO MEMBERS OF ONE OF

02:37.200 --> 02:38.900
HIS GOLF CLUBS THAT HE GOES TO

02:38.900 --> 02:40.667
HIS OWN PROPERTIES SO FREQUENTLY

02:40.667 --> 02:43.633
THESE DAYS BECAUSE, QUOTE, "THAT

02:43.633 --> 02:49.567
WHITE HOUSE IS A REAL DUMP."

02:49.567 --> 02:50.700
>> John: YES, IT SEEMS ODD TO

02:50.700 --> 02:51.600
CALL AN OBJECTIVELY GRAND

02:51.600 --> 02:53.433
RESIDENCE "A DUMP," UNTIL YOU

02:53.433 --> 02:54.800
REMEMBER TRUMP'S TASTE IN

02:54.800 --> 02:57.367
INTERIOR DESIGN IS A CROSS

02:57.367 --> 02:58.934
BETWEEN C-3PO'S COLON, AND A

02:58.934 --> 03:00.667
MUSEUM WHERE NO ONE HAS EVER

03:00.667 --> 03:02.900
LEARNED ANYTHING.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.100
TRUMP QUICKLY ISSUED A STATEMENT

03:04.100 --> 03:04.800
DENYING THAT HE'D SAID THAT,

03:04.800 --> 03:06.066
TWEETING,

03:06.066 --> 03:07.767
"I LOVE THE WHITE HOUSE, ONE OF

03:07.767 --> 03:08.533
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS"

03:08.533 --> 03:09.967
PARENTHESES "HOMES I HAVE EVER

03:09.967 --> 03:13.600
SEEN."

03:13.600 --> 03:14.367
AND THAT'S TWO QUALIFIERS!

03:14.367 --> 03:15.800
IN ONE SENTENCE!

03:15.800 --> 03:16.867
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF SAYING,

03:16.867 --> 03:18.233
"I LOVE MY WIFE.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.800
SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

03:20.800 --> 03:21.900
WOMEN PARENTHESES OLDER THAN 30

03:21.900 --> 03:23.333
I HAVE EVER SEEN."

03:23.333 --> 03:24.633
BUT THE JOURNALIST WHO WROTE THE

03:24.633 --> 03:25.633
STORY STOOD BY IT, STATING THAT

03:25.633 --> 03:27.400
TRUMP "SAID THIS IN FRONT OF

03:27.400 --> 03:28.767
EIGHT OR NINE" PEOPLE.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.934
WHICH IS A PRETTY BRILLIANT WAY

03:30.934 --> 03:32.700
TO GET TRUMP TO CONFIRM IT:

03:32.700 --> 03:34.033
ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF HIS CROWD

03:34.033 --> 03:35.633
AND JUST WAIT FOR HIM TO CORRECT

03:35.633 --> 03:36.834
YOU.

03:36.834 --> 03:38.567
"NO, I DIDN'T CALL THE WHITE

03:38.567 --> 03:40.300
HOUSE A "DUMP" IN FRONT OF EIGHT

03:40.300 --> 03:41.533
OR NINE PEOPLE -- I SAID IT IN

03:41.533 --> 03:42.934
FRONT OF "HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS"

03:42.934 --> 03:43.600
OF PEOPLE, AND ALL OF THEM WERE

03:43.600 --> 03:45.300
10s, AND ALL OF THEM LOVED IT,

03:45.300 --> 03:46.600
AND THE NEXT DAY EVERYONE CALLED

03:46.600 --> 03:49.400
ME AND TOLD ME NO ONE HAD EVER

03:49.400 --> 03:51.767
DONE A BETTER JOB OF CALLING THE

03:51.767 --> 03:55.033
WHITE HOUSE A DUMP.

03:55.033 --> 03:58.033
NOBODY HAD DONE IT!

03:58.033 --> 03:59.600
I'M SAD INSIDE!"

03:59.600 --> 04:00.867
AND TRUMP STILL WASN'T DONE --

04:00.867 --> 04:01.600
BECAUSE ON THURSDAY, IT EMERGED

04:01.600 --> 04:02.800
THAT IN A CONVERSATION WITH

04:02.800 --> 04:03.500
MEXICO'S PRESIDENT, HE HAD

04:03.500 --> 04:04.567
SHIT-TALKED AN ENTIRE AMERICAN

04:04.567 --> 04:06.367
STATE.

04:06.367 --> 04:07.900
>> WHILE TALKING ABOUT STOPPING

04:07.900 --> 04:09.100
THE FLOW OF DRUGS INTO THE

04:09.100 --> 04:10.133
UNITED STATES, THE PRESIDENT

04:10.133 --> 04:11.367
ALSO SAID THIS, AND I'M QUOTING

04:11.367 --> 04:13.266
HIM, "I WON NEW HAMPSHIRE

04:13.266 --> 04:15.033
BECAUSE NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A

04:15.033 --> 04:17.500
DRUG-INFESTED DEN."

04:17.500 --> 04:19.133
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, OBVIOUSLY,

04:19.133 --> 04:19.700
HE'S WRONG ABOUT WINNING NEW

04:19.700 --> 04:20.567
HAMPSHIRE.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.133
HE LOST IT IN THE GENERAL.

04:22.133 --> 04:24.567
BUT SECOND, I'M NOT GOING TO SIT

04:24.567 --> 04:26.200
HERE AND DEFEND THE STATE OF

04:26.200 --> 04:27.300
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.500
I HAVEN'T LOST SOME TERRIBLE

04:28.500 --> 04:33.266
DARE.

04:33.266 --> 04:34.400
BUT THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO SHIT,

04:34.400 --> 04:35.033
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, ON

04:35.033 --> 04:35.667
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

04:35.667 --> 04:36.800
IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, JUST

04:36.800 --> 04:37.567
POINT OUT IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN

04:37.567 --> 04:39.467
9,000 SQUARE MILES OF GRANITE

04:39.467 --> 04:40.934
AND LYME DISEASE, AND IT'S THE

04:40.934 --> 04:43.767
ONLY STATE SO BORING, IT CAN

04:43.767 --> 04:44.633
GENUINELY MAKE YOU SAY, "OH,

04:44.633 --> 04:48.467
THANK GOD, WE'RE IN MAINE NOW."

04:48.467 --> 04:49.967
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

04:49.967 --> 04:50.967
IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS ONLY

04:50.967 --> 04:52.133
TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE

04:52.133 --> 04:53.166
ATTACKING CORNERSTONES OF

04:53.166 --> 04:54.700
AMERICA.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.000
IT WAS ALSO STEPHEN MILLER,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.667
POLICY ADVISER AND

04:57.667 --> 05:02.567
VITAMIN-D-DEFICIENT MINION.

05:02.567 --> 05:03.567
YES, YOU MIGHT WELL THINK,

05:03.567 --> 05:04.834
"THAT'S UNFAIR.

05:04.834 --> 05:05.567
ANYONE CAN FIND A PHOTO OF

05:05.567 --> 05:06.767
SOMEONE LOOKING A BIT LIKE A

05:06.767 --> 05:08.000
MINION."

05:08.000 --> 05:09.767
BUT WITH MILLER, IT IS GENUINELY

05:09.767 --> 05:11.800
HARD TO FIND A PHOTO OF HIM NOT

05:11.800 --> 05:12.567
LOOKING LIKE A MINION.

05:12.567 --> 05:13.667
I'LL SHOW YOU.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.200
FROWNY MINION,

05:15.200 --> 05:16.767
SMOOCHY MINION,

05:16.767 --> 05:17.767
SMILEY MINION!

05:17.767 --> 05:19.133
LOOK!

05:19.133 --> 05:20.166
THEY'RE BOTH HAPPY BECAUSE

05:20.166 --> 05:23.200
THEY'RE PLANNING SOMETHING!

05:23.200 --> 05:25.934
IN ANY CASE, MILLER SPOKE TO THE

05:25.934 --> 05:27.367
PRESS THIS WEEK ABOUT THE WHITE

05:27.367 --> 05:28.367
HOUSE'S SUPPORT FOR A DRACONIAN

05:28.367 --> 05:29.266
IMMIGRATION BILL, WHICH WOULD

05:29.266 --> 05:30.600
SLASH LEGAL IMMIGRATION LEVELS

05:30.600 --> 05:32.367
IN HALF OVER A DECADE, AND MAKE

05:32.367 --> 05:33.633
CITIZENSHIP CONTINGENT

05:33.633 --> 05:34.767
ON FACTORS SUCH AS ENGLISH

05:34.767 --> 05:35.934
ABILITY, EDUCATION LEVELS, AND

05:35.934 --> 05:37.066
JOB SKILLS.

05:37.066 --> 05:39.100
WHICH PROMPTED THIS INCREDIBLE

05:39.100 --> 05:40.800
EXCHANGE WITH CNN'S JIM ACOSTA.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.100
>> THE STATUE OF LIBERTY SAYS,

05:42.100 --> 05:43.166
"GIVE ME YOUR TIRED, YOUR POOR,

05:43.166 --> 05:44.967
YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO

05:44.967 --> 05:46.333
BREATHE FREE."

05:46.333 --> 05:48.333
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

05:48.333 --> 05:49.734
SPEAKING ENGLISH OR BEING ABLE

05:49.734 --> 05:52.200
TO BE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.000
>> THE POEM THAT YOU'RE

05:53.000 --> 05:53.900
REFERRING TO, THAT WAS ADDED

05:53.900 --> 05:54.900
LATER

05:54.900 --> 05:56.000
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A PART OF THE

05:56.000 --> 05:57.667
ORIGINAL STATUE OF LIBERTY.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.667
>> John: WAIT, THOUGH.

06:00.667 --> 06:03.667
JUST BECAUSE IT WASN'T PART OF

06:03.667 --> 06:04.367
THE ORIGINAL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

06:04.367 --> 06:05.033
WORTHLESS.

06:05.033 --> 06:05.834
SOME OF THE BEST THINGS EVER

06:05.834 --> 06:06.633
MADE WERE CHANGED PARTWAY

06:06.633 --> 06:07.567
THROUGH.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.900
DID YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME

06:08.900 --> 06:10.033
WHERE "FAST AND FURIOUS" MOVIES

06:10.033 --> 06:11.333
DIDN'T HAVE THE ROCK?

06:11.333 --> 06:13.266
IT'S TRUE!

06:13.266 --> 06:17.767
THEY SUCKED!

06:17.767 --> 06:18.467
THAT'S WHY THEY ADDED THE

06:18.467 --> 06:20.433
FUCKING ROCK!

06:20.433 --> 06:21.533
IT WASN'T THE GREATEST PIECE OF

06:21.533 --> 06:23.000
COMMUNICATION FROM

06:23.000 --> 06:24.266
STEPHEN MILLER, SO OF COURSE,

06:24.266 --> 06:25.333
THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW

06:25.333 --> 06:26.700
CONSIDERING HIM FOR THE

06:26.700 --> 06:28.233
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR JOB,

06:28.233 --> 06:32.934
TAKING OVER FOR THE DEARLY

06:32.934 --> 06:34.567
DEPARTED "MOOCH."

06:34.567 --> 06:35.834
AND THAT WOULD BE A LOT OF

06:35.834 --> 06:36.900
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MAN WHO IS

06:36.900 --> 06:38.300
-- AND THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST

06:38.300 --> 06:40.934
SHOCKING THING YOU LEARN TONIGHT

06:40.934 --> 06:42.300
-- 31 YEARS OLD.

06:42.300 --> 06:46.266
31 HUMAN YEARS OLD.

06:46.266 --> 06:47.533
HE IS THE SAME AGE AS THE OLSEN

06:47.533 --> 06:48.433
TWIN.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.400
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.166
I SAID TWIN.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.667
THERE'S ONLY ONE IN THAT PHOTO,

06:53.667 --> 06:54.967
SHE'S TRICKING YOUR EYES BY

06:54.967 --> 06:55.734
MOVING VERY QUICKLY.

06:55.734 --> 06:56.767
HOW IS SHE DOING THAT IN A STILL

06:56.767 --> 06:59.300
PHOTOGRAPH?

06:59.300 --> 06:59.900
I DON'T KNOW THAT YET, BUT I'M

06:59.900 --> 07:02.400
CLOSE.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.467
I'M REALLY CLOSE.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.467
THE POINT IS, MILLER IS SO YOUNG

07:06.467 --> 07:07.633
THERE ARE ACTUALLY VIDEOS ON THE

07:07.633 --> 07:08.433
INTERNET OF WHAT HE WAS LIKE IN

07:08.433 --> 07:09.300
HIGH SCHOOL.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.667
AND FIRST OF ALL, OBVIOUSLY:

07:10.667 --> 07:12.667

10:02.667 --> 10:03.734
THE BORDER PATROL.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.133
WHO THEY ARE.

10:06.133 --> 10:07.233
THEY'RE PART OF

10:07.233 --> 10:09.000

10:24.500 --> 10:25.567

10:25.567 --> 10:26.633

10:26.633 --> 10:27.467
LITERALLY PATROL THE BOUNDARIES

10:27.467 --> 10:29.133
OF OUR COUNTRY.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.133
THERE ARE AROUND 20,000 OF THEM,

10:31.133 --> 10:32.633
BUT TRUMP, IN AN EXECUTIVE

10:32.633 --> 10:34.767
ORDER, HAS CALLED FOR THEM TO

10:34.767 --> 10:36.467
ADD 5,000 MORE, TO TACKLE THE

10:49.700 --> 10:50.433
CAN HAVE ANYTHING COMING ACROSS

XENOPHOBIC AND ENDS IT FEELING

11:17.100 --> 11:18.400
PATROL AGENTS DO A LOT MORE THAN

11:18.400 --> 11:20.333
FIGHT DRUGS, CRIME, AND GRAVY.

IN RECENT YEARS, THE NUMBER OF

11:22.333 --> 11:24.367
MEXICANS APPREHENDED CROSSING

11:24.367 --> 11:25.900
THE BORDER HAS DRAMATICALLY

11:25.900 --> 11:26.867
DROPPED, AND HAS NOW BEEN

11:26.867 --> 11:27.900

11:27.900 --> 11:29.633
MIGRANTS FLEEING VIOLENCE IN

CENTRAL AMERICA, FOR WHOM THERE

11:30.834 --> 11:31.934
IS A LEGAL PROCESS TO SEEK

11:31.934 --> 11:33.467
ASYLUM HERE.

11:33.467 --> 11:35.133
MEANING THAT AGENTS' DAYS CAN

11:35.133 --> 11:36.433
FREQUENTLY INCLUDE MOMENTS LIKE

11:36.433 --> 11:38.400
THIS.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.767
>> THE BOCCHE FAMILY TAKE THEIR

11:40.767 --> 11:42.333
FIRST TENTATIVE STEPS INTO THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.433
WITHIN SECONDS, THE BORDER

11:47.433 --> 11:49.700
PATROL ARE ON THEM, THERE'S NO

11:49.700 --> 11:50.467
CHASE, NO TENSION, THEY EXPECTED

11:50.467 --> 11:52.567
TO BE CAUGHT.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.066
>> AS WE FILM, ANOTHER TWO

11:54.066 --> 11:55.233

11:55.233 --> 11:56.233
DAUGHTER.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.266
THEY'RE GIVEN BLANKETS TO

11:57.266 --> 11:59.500
PROTECT THEM FROM THE COLD.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.000
>> John: THAT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE

12:01.000 --> 12:02.033
EXPECT WHEN THEY THINK OF THE

12:02.033 --> 12:03.100
BORDER.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.467
IN THE VENN DIAGRAM OF

12:04.467 --> 12:06.467
"HARDENED DRUG DEALERS" AND

12:06.467 --> 12:08.133
"PEOPLE WHO NEED BLANKETS," THAT

12:08.133 --> 12:09.467
MIDDLE SECTION IS PRETTY MUCH

12:09.467 --> 12:15.500
JUST LINUS.

12:15.500 --> 12:21.233
OH, I'M SORRY, HE'S NOT A DRUG

12:21.233 --> 12:22.033

12:24.066 --> 12:24.700
SELLS ECSTASY AT RAVES, AND HE'S

12:24.700 --> 12:25.300
HIGH ON HIS OWN SUPPLY ALL THE

12:25.300 --> 12:25.734
TIME!

12:25.734 --> 12:29.667
THERE IS NO GREAT PUMPKIN!

HE'S A JUNKIE!

12:30.000 --> 12:32.767
SOMEONE INTERVENE!

12:32.767 --> 12:33.667
BUT IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THAT THAT

12:33.667 --> 12:34.700
SHOW HOW DIFFICULT THE JOB OF A

12:34.700 --> 12:35.867
BORDER PATROL AGENT CAN BE --

12:35.867 --> 12:36.834
BECAUSE IN THAT MOMENT, THEY'RE

12:36.834 --> 12:37.867
DELIVERING AID AND PROCESSING

12:37.867 --> 12:38.967
MIGRANTS, AND LATER THAT DAY,

12:38.967 --> 12:39.900
THEY MIGHT BE CHASING DOWN DRUG

12:39.900 --> 12:41.533
TRAFFICKERS.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.700
IT'S A MIXTURE BETWEEN

12:42.700 --> 12:43.767
HUMANITARIAN WORK AND LAW

12:43.767 --> 12:44.967
ENFORCEMENT, AND NOT EVERYONE

12:44.967 --> 12:46.533
CAN DO IT.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.734
AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES TRUMP'S

12:48.734 --> 12:50.100
PLAN TO EXPAND THE BORDER PATROL

12:50.100 --> 12:52.200
BY 25 PERCENT SO CONCERNING.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.700
BECAUSE IF YOU HIRE AGENTS

12:53.700 --> 12:57.100
QUICKLY AND BADLY, IT CAN

12:57.100 --> 12:57.800
ACTUALLY LEAVE US MUCH LESS

12:57.800 --> 12:58.734
SAFE, AND HAVE DEVASTATING

12:58.734 --> 13:01.500
CONSEQUENCES.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.100
AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE'VE

13:04.100 --> 13:05.066
BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE.

13:05.066 --> 13:05.900
SO TONIGHT, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO

13:05.900 --> 13:06.667
YOU ABOUT THE LAST BORDER PATROL

13:06.667 --> 13:07.767
HIRING SURGE.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.500
BECAUSE IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.800

13:20.166 --> 13:21.467
AS PART OF THAT MANDATE, THE

13:29.734 --> 13:33.233
PATROL AGENTS THAT WAS MATCHED

13:33.233 --> 13:34.300
ONLY BY THE SURGE IN THE NUMBER

13:34.300 --> 13:34.967
OF REALITY SHOWS ABOUT PEOPLE

13:34.967 --> 13:35.800
MAKING CAKES.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.567
THERE WERE SO MANY, YOU DON'T

13:36.567 --> 13:37.300
EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE OF THESE I

13:37.300 --> 13:38.533
MADE UP.

13:38.533 --> 13:43.200
IT WAS "CAKE CUCKS."

13:43.200 --> 13:43.934
WHICH I GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE IN

13:43.934 --> 13:45.100
PRODUCTION BY NEXT WEEK.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.233
NOW, TO MEET THE SURGE'S

13:46.233 --> 13:47.166
AMBITIOUS TARGETS, RECRUITMENT

13:47.166 --> 13:48.133
WAS AGGRESSIVE.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.266
AND THE GOVERNMENT ADVERTISED

13:49.266 --> 13:50.333
EVERYWHERE, EVEN AT ONE POINT,

13:50.333 --> 13:52.300
DOING THIS.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.667

14:10.133 --> 14:11.633
UNDERWEAR AND BOUDREAUX'S

14:11.633 --> 14:14.000
BUTT PASTE.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.633
A PRODUCT FOR, I ASSUME, PEOPLE

14:15.633 --> 14:16.367
WHO WANT THEIR BUTT PASTED

14:16.367 --> 14:18.200
CLOSED.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.467
AND THAT WASN'T ALL.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.200
THEY ALSO RAN SLICKLY PRODUCED

14:21.200 --> 14:22.500
TV ADS LIKE THIS.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.600
>> AS A MOBILE LAW ENFORCEMENT

14:24.600 --> 14:25.633
ARM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

14:25.633 --> 14:27.000
HOMELAND SECURITY, IT IS THE JOB

14:27.000 --> 14:29.367
OF THE BORDER PATROL TO PREVENT

14:29.367 --> 14:31.734
TERRORISTS AND TERRORIST WEAPONS

14:31.734 --> 14:33.133
AND ALL THOSE WHO SEEK TO DO US

14:33.133 --> 14:34.300
HARM FROM ENTERING THE UNITED

14:34.300 --> 14:44.900
STATES.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.367
>> GROUND UNITS ARE ON THE WAY.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.333
>> THE BORDER PATROL.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.433
WE PROTECT AMERICA.

14:50.433 --> 14:56.266
ARE YOU UP TO THE CHALLENGE?

14:56.266 --> 14:57.066
>> John: YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THEY

14:57.066 --> 14:58.433
MAKE THE JOB LOOK VERY EXCITING.

14:58.433 --> 14:59.066
ALTHOUGH, IN FAIRNESS, ANYTHING

14:59.066 --> 14:59.834
SAID IN THAT VOICE WOULD BE

14:59.834 --> 15:00.633
EXCITING.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.867
"HERE IS MY KITTEN.

15:01.867 --> 15:02.867
I NAMED HIM BOOTSIE.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.600
DON'T WEE ON THE RUG, BOOTSIE!

15:04.600 --> 15:05.400
I'M NOT SURE HE LIKES ME AS MUCH

15:05.400 --> 15:09.667
AS I LIKE HIM!"

15:09.667 --> 15:10.900
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE JOB IS,

15:10.900 --> 15:11.967
MOST AGENTS WORK ALONE

15:11.967 --> 15:13.934
PATROLLING VAST SWATHS OF

15:13.934 --> 15:14.934
DESERT.

15:14.934 --> 15:16.200
AND WHILE SOME DAYS FEATURE

15:16.200 --> 15:17.367
BURSTS OF ACTION, OTHERS CAN

15:17.367 --> 15:18.467
INVOLVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING --

15:18.467 --> 15:19.300
WHICH CAN BE CHALLENGING IN AND

15:19.300 --> 15:20.400
OF ITSELF.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.433
>> ONE OF THE LARGER PROBLEMS IS

15:22.433 --> 15:23.500
BOREDOM.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.533
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S

15:24.533 --> 15:25.867
NEVER DANGEROUS.

15:25.867 --> 15:27.066
THERE ARE BANDITS OUT THERE,

15:27.066 --> 15:29.033
THERE ARE DRUG ORGANIZATIONS OUT

15:29.033 --> 15:31.633
THERE.

15:31.633 --> 15:34.467
WHAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY GETTING

15:34.467 --> 15:36.567
IS PREPARATION FOR THE BORING

15:36.567 --> 15:39.300
NON-RISKY REALITY OF ALMOST ALL

15:39.300 --> 15:45.266
OF THEIR CAREER.

15:45.266 --> 15:46.567
>> John: EXACTLY.

15:46.567 --> 15:47.734
BOREDOM IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF

15:47.734 --> 15:48.467
LIFE AS A BORDER PATROL AGENT.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.467
AND THEY SHOULD PROBABLY TRAIN

15:49.467 --> 15:50.667
FOR IT.

15:50.667 --> 15:51.767
FOR EVERY HOUR THEY SPEND IN

15:51.767 --> 15:53.800
TARGET PRACTICE, THEY SHOULD

15:53.800 --> 15:54.767
PROBABLY SPEND TEN HOURS

15:54.767 --> 15:55.567
WATCHING

15:55.567 --> 15:57.000
"MOZART IN THE JUNGLE."

15:57.000 --> 15:58.800
ARE YOU FUNNY?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.266
AM I SUPPOSED TO CARE ABOUT YOU?

16:00.266 --> 16:01.800
WHO IS THAT WOMAN WITH THE OBOE?

16:01.800 --> 16:05.934
I'M CONFUSED, BUT ALSO BORED.

16:05.934 --> 16:07.734
BUT THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT, AS

16:07.734 --> 16:09.233
THEY DOUBLED IN SIZE, MEETING

16:09.233 --> 16:10.567
AND MAINTAINING THEIR HIRING

16:10.567 --> 16:11.567
QUOTAS MEANT THEIR SCREENING

16:11.567 --> 16:12.834
PROCESS WASN'T ALWAYS AS STRONG

16:12.834 --> 16:13.967
AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

16:13.967 --> 16:15.667
IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE SURGE

16:15.667 --> 16:17.467
THAT THE CBP STARTED GIVING

16:17.467 --> 16:18.900
APPLICANTS POLYGRAPH TESTS --

16:18.900 --> 16:20.633
SOMETHING THAT MOST OTHER

16:20.633 --> 16:21.400
FEDERAL LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

16:21.400 --> 16:22.500
DO.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.633
AND TO LISTEN TO

16:23.633 --> 16:25.467
JAMES TOMSHECK, WHO HEADED

16:25.467 --> 16:27.133
INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR CBP THROUGH

16:27.133 --> 16:28.533
MOST OF THE SURGE, THEIR

16:28.533 --> 16:30.000
FINDINGS INDICATED THEY PROBABLY

16:30.000 --> 16:33.100
SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT SOONER.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.600
>> THE SHOCKING DISCOVERY WE

16:34.600 --> 16:36.066
FOUND WAS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF

16:36.066 --> 16:37.367
THE PERSONS WHO HAD CLEARED

16:37.367 --> 16:38.867
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS FAILED

16:38.867 --> 16:40.700
THE POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.600
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

16:42.600 --> 16:44.166
PROVIDING DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS

16:44.166 --> 16:46.033
OF THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THEY

16:46.033 --> 16:47.900
HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.400
>> John: THINK ABOUT THAT.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.066
OVER HALF OF CBP'S APPLICANTS,

16:51.066 --> 16:52.567
WHO HAD CLEARED THE HIGHEST

16:52.567 --> 16:54.000
LEVEL OF BACKGROUND CHECK, WERE

16:54.000 --> 16:55.934
FOUND UNSUITABLE FOR SERVICE.

16:55.934 --> 16:59.066
AND SOME OF WHAT THEY CONFESSED

16:59.066 --> 17:00.600
TO WAS INCREDIBLE.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.734
ONE APPLICANT ADMITTED TO

17:02.734 --> 17:04.367
SMOKING MARIJUANA 20,000 TIMES

17:04.367 --> 17:09.100
IN A 10-YEAR-PERIOD,

17:09.100 --> 17:13.367
KUDOS TO THAT INDIVIDUAL,

17:13.367 --> 17:14.600
WHILE ANOTHER STATED HE

17:14.600 --> 17:15.700
HAD "NO INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION

17:15.700 --> 17:16.667
OF THE EVENTS THAT RESULTED IN A

17:16.667 --> 17:17.900
BLOOD-DOUSED KITCHEN, AND WAS

17:17.900 --> 17:18.934
UNCERTAIN IF HE COMMITTED ANY

17:18.934 --> 17:19.867
CRIME DURING HIS THREE-HOUR

17:19.867 --> 17:20.900
BLACK OUT."

17:20.900 --> 17:22.000
WHICH I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

17:22.000 --> 17:23.133
SAY, YES, YOU DID COMMIT A

17:23.133 --> 17:24.734
CRIME!

17:24.734 --> 17:26.033
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, YOU

17:26.033 --> 17:29.900
REALLY FUCKED UP A SOUFFLE.

17:29.900 --> 17:33.633
I MEAN, HE WAS FUCKED THAT UP

17:33.633 --> 17:35.867
BAD!

17:35.867 --> 17:37.133
AND THE PROBLEMS INCREASED ONCE

17:37.133 --> 17:38.000
THE NEW AGENTS WERE HIRED,

17:38.000 --> 17:38.767
BECAUSE THE TRAINING WAS ALSO

17:38.767 --> 17:39.700
SIGNIFICANTLY CUT BACK.

17:39.700 --> 17:40.800
AND THAT CAUSED REAL ISSUES, AS

17:40.800 --> 17:41.900
ONE TRAINER REVEALED WHILE, FOR

17:41.900 --> 17:42.934
SOME REASON, DISGUISED AS AN

17:42.934 --> 17:44.033
ASTHMATIC SCARECROW.

17:44.033 --> 17:46.033
>> WE ARE DISGUISING THE FACE

17:46.033 --> 17:47.934
AND VOICE OF THIS VETERAN AGENT

17:47.934 --> 17:49.467
AND TRAINING INSTRUCTOR BECAUSE

17:49.467 --> 17:51.433
OF FEARS OF RETALIATION.

17:51.433 --> 17:52.667
>> WE WENT FROM A 20-WEEK COURSE

17:52.667 --> 17:53.734
TO A 12-WEEK COURSE.

17:53.734 --> 17:54.367
>> SO THE STANDARDS WERE

17:54.367 --> 17:56.266
LOWERED.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.667
>> WELL, THEY SAY THE STANDARDS

17:57.667 --> 17:59.667
WEREN'T LOWERED BUT THEY WERE.

17:59.667 --> 18:03.400
>> John: WHAT IS HAPPENING?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.734
HE SOUNDS LIKE JESSE VENTURA

18:04.734 --> 18:06.066
AFTER SWALLOWING ONE OF THOSE

18:06.066 --> 18:09.100
NOVELTY COW VOICE NOISEMAKERS.

18:09.100 --> 18:10.266
AND LOOK: I KNOW IT IS HARD TO

18:10.266 --> 18:12.567
PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT ROBOT

18:12.567 --> 18:14.133
NEIL YOUNG IS SAYING, BUT IT'S

18:14.133 --> 18:19.133
GENUINELY WORTH LISTENING TO

18:19.133 --> 18:22.200
WHERE THEY CUT CORNERS.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
>> THE SOURCE TOLD US, SPANISH

18:23.200 --> 18:24.300
LANGUAGE CLASSES AND PHYSICAL

18:24.300 --> 18:25.300
TRAINING WERE CUT BACK.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.367
>> THE PERSON WAS SO OUT OF

18:26.367 --> 18:27.333
SHAPE I ACTUALLY HAD TO TREAT

18:27.333 --> 18:28.300
THE TRAINEE AND THE BAD GUY GOT

18:28.300 --> 18:29.433
AWAY.

18:29.433 --> 18:30.400
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY GETS

18:30.400 --> 18:33.934
THROUGH THE ACADEMY.

18:33.934 --> 18:35.433
>> John: THEY CUT BACK ON

18:35.433 --> 18:38.433
SPANISH AND PHYSICAL TRAINING.

18:38.433 --> 18:39.433
SO, THE NEW STANDARDS AFFECTED

18:39.433 --> 18:40.300
AGENTS' ABILITY TO TALK TO THE

18:40.300 --> 18:41.200
PEOPLE THEY CAUGHT, AND THEIR

18:41.200 --> 18:42.100
ABILITY TO CATCH THE PEOPLE THEY

18:42.100 --> 18:43.133
WANTED TO TALK TO.

18:43.133 --> 18:44.166
WHICH SEEM PRETTY ESSENTIAL

18:44.166 --> 18:45.567
FACETS OF THEIR JOB.

18:45.567 --> 18:46.633
IT'S LIKE IF THE TRAINING

18:46.633 --> 18:48.000
PROGRAM AT SEAWORLD LEFT OUT

18:48.000 --> 18:49.200
"PUTTING ON A WETSUIT" AND

18:49.200 --> 18:51.000
"SYSTEMATICALLY DRIVING

18:51.000 --> 18:52.767
CARNIVOROUS WHALES INSANE."

18:52.767 --> 18:56.700
THAT'S THE WHOLE JOB!

18:56.700 --> 18:57.533
TAKE THEM AWAY, YOU ARE LEFT

18:57.533 --> 19:00.433
WITH NOTHING ELSE.

19:00.433 --> 19:01.333
AND CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE YEARS

19:01.333 --> 19:02.266
FOLLOWING THE SURGE, AS THE

19:02.266 --> 19:03.200
RANKS GREW, CORRUPTION AND

19:03.200 --> 19:04.233
EXCESSIVE FORCE SKYROCKETED.

19:04.233 --> 19:05.233
MISCONDUCT BECAME SUCH A PROBLEM

19:05.233 --> 19:06.433
THAT, AT ONE POINT, THE BORDER

19:06.433 --> 19:07.967
PATROL FELT IT NEEDED TO ISSUE A

19:07.967 --> 19:09.066
MEMO ABOUT THE FACT THEIR AGENTS

19:09.066 --> 19:10.500
WERE AVERAGING TWO

19:10.500 --> 19:11.900
ALCOHOL-RELATED ARRESTS PER

19:11.900 --> 19:13.133
WEEK.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.333
AND SOME AGENTS' OFF-DUTY

19:14.333 --> 19:15.600
RUN-INS WITH THE LAW WERE EVEN

19:15.600 --> 19:16.767
MORE SPECTACULAR.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.700
>> TONIGHT, TWO BORDER AGENTS

19:18.700 --> 19:21.266
ARE ON LEAVE, AFTER A WOMAN SAYS

19:21.266 --> 19:22.300
THEY PUT ON A LEWD SHOW DURING

19:22.300 --> 19:24.233
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL, PERFORMING A

19:24.233 --> 19:27.734
SEX ACT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.734
THE ACCUSATIONS DON'T STOP

19:28.734 --> 19:29.533
THERE.

19:29.533 --> 19:30.367
THE COUPLE IS SUSPECTED OF BEING

19:30.367 --> 19:31.433
DRUNK AND VIOLENT.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.867
>> John: WOW.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.000
NOW, I SHOULD TELL YOU, ONE

19:35.000 --> 19:36.100
AGENT WAS FOUND GUILTY OF

19:36.100 --> 19:37.200
ASSAULTING THE WOMAN WHO

19:37.200 --> 19:39.100
COMPLAINED, BUT BOTH DENIED THAT

19:39.100 --> 19:40.166
ANYTHING SEXUAL WAS HAPPENING,

19:40.166 --> 19:41.200
AND THEY WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY

19:41.200 --> 19:42.467
OF THE SEX ACT.

19:42.467 --> 19:44.367
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE AT

19:44.367 --> 19:46.900
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL, WHERE

19:46.900 --> 19:48.300
EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE A SEX ACT.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.266
I'LL SHOW YOU.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.400
THIS IS A SEX ACT,

19:51.400 --> 19:52.734
THIS IS A SEX ACT,

19:52.734 --> 19:53.834
THIS IS A WILDLY DIFFICULT SEX

19:53.834 --> 19:55.166
ACT,

19:55.166 --> 19:57.233
THAT'S A BIRD-PERSON SEX ACT,

19:57.233 --> 19:58.900
AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

19:58.900 --> 20:00.400
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE, BUT I

20:00.400 --> 20:01.667
THINK IT'S THE THING THAT

20:01.667 --> 20:02.633
STEVE BANNON'S SUPPOSED TO BE

20:02.633 --> 20:07.033
GOOD AT.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.033
AND THINGS GOT MORE SERIOUS THAN

20:08.033 --> 20:09.867
THAT.

20:09.867 --> 20:12.100
SINCE 2005, 77 AGENTS WERE

20:12.100 --> 20:13.000
ARRESTED OR INDICTED FOR

20:13.000 --> 20:14.133
CORRUPTION.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.633
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

20:15.633 --> 20:16.767
BORDER PATROL AGENTS ARE

20:16.767 --> 20:18.700
PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO DRUG

20:18.700 --> 20:20.300
TRAFFICKERS.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.200
REMEMBER: THEY OFTEN WORK ON

20:21.200 --> 20:22.000
THEIR OWN, PATROLLING THE

20:22.000 --> 20:22.834
BORDER.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.200
WHICH, AS ONE JOURNALIST POINTS

20:24.200 --> 20:25.133
OUT, IS A PRETTY POTENT RECIPE

20:25.133 --> 20:26.834
FOR TROUBLE.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.233
>> ONE BORDER PATROL AGENT CAN

20:28.233 --> 20:31.367
UNDO AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

20:31.367 --> 20:33.066
GOOD THAT ALL THE OTHER BORDER

20:33.066 --> 20:34.400
PATROL AGENTS DO.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.867
ONE BORDER PATROL AGENT CAN WAVE

20:36.867 --> 20:38.467
IN TONS OF DRUGS.

20:38.467 --> 20:39.266
AND YOU KNOW --

20:39.266 --> 20:41.000
>> YOU MEAN THAT LITERALLY.

20:41.000 --> 20:41.700
>> I LITERALLY.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.233
ABSOLUTELY LITERALLY.

20:43.233 --> 20:44.467
>> John: YES, THIS IS ONE OF THE

20:44.467 --> 20:46.000
ONLY CASES WHERE SOMEONE SAYING

20:46.000 --> 20:48.200
"A TON OF DRUGS" ACTUALLY MEANS

20:48.200 --> 20:49.400
"A LITERAL TON OF DRUGS."

20:49.400 --> 20:51.700
NO, KEVIN.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.500
YOU DID NOT DO A "TON" OF DRUGS.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.300
YOU TOOK A BENADRYL, MADE OUT

20:55.300 --> 20:56.467
WITH A GOLDFISH, AND PASSED OUT

20:56.467 --> 20:57.066
WITH YOUR HEAD IN THE

20:57.066 --> 21:00.600
DISHWASHER.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.600
PULL YOUR LIFE TOGETHER.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.834
AND LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A TASTE

21:04.834 --> 21:05.400
OF THE KIND OF SPECTACULAR

21:05.400 --> 21:06.433
CORRUPTION INVOLVED.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.867
TAKE AGENT JOEL LUNA, WHO, IT

21:07.867 --> 21:09.667
TURNED OUT, HAD A BROTHER IN THE

21:09.667 --> 21:11.100
GULF CARTEL, AND WHO WAS

21:11.100 --> 21:12.300
CONVICTED OF ENGAGING IN

21:12.300 --> 21:13.467
ORGANIZED CRIME, WITH SOME

21:13.467 --> 21:14.633
PRETTY STRIKING EVIDENCE

21:14.633 --> 21:17.333
EMERGING DURING A HOUSE SEARCH.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.467
>> WE ENDED UP FINDING A SAFE, A

21:18.467 --> 21:21.567
BLACK SAFE.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.467
WE FOUND $89,000 IN CASH.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.700
>> JOEL LUNA'S COMMEMORATIVE

21:25.700 --> 21:26.867
BORDER PATROL BADGE, KILO AND A

21:26.867 --> 21:28.000
HALF OF COCAINE,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.767
METHAMPHETAMINE.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.333
A GUN THAT'S TIED DIRECTLY TO

21:32.333 --> 21:33.867
THE GULF CARTEL.

21:33.867 --> 21:35.400
IT SAYS "GULF CARTEL" ON IT.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.600
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN THAT AWAY.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.767
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN WHY YOUR

21:38.767 --> 21:40.300
BORDER PATROL BADGE IS IN A SAFE

21:40.300 --> 21:41.533
WITH COCAINE, MONEY, AND A

21:41.533 --> 21:42.967
CARTEL PISTOL.

21:42.967 --> 21:44.834
>> John: YEAH.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.166
THAT IS REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN.

21:47.166 --> 21:48.700
THE BEST I CAN DO IS, "MY BADGE

21:48.700 --> 21:49.867
HAD A DRUG PROBLEM THAT IT

21:49.867 --> 21:51.300
COULDN'T BEAR TO TELL ME ABOUT,

21:51.300 --> 21:52.834
SO FINALLY IT DECIDED TO SHOOT

21:52.834 --> 21:53.967
ITSELF WITH A GUN WE FOUND ON A

21:53.967 --> 21:55.133
CASE, PLANNING TO DIE SURROUNDED

21:55.133 --> 21:56.467
BY ITS MONEY BECAUSE ITS VIEWS

21:56.467 --> 21:57.467
ON DEATH RESEMBLED THOSE OF THE

21:57.467 --> 21:58.834
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS."

21:58.834 --> 22:00.433
BUT EVEN THEN, WE'RE TALKING

22:00.433 --> 22:01.934
ABOUT A SENTIENT POLICE BADGE

22:01.934 --> 22:03.600
WITH AN INTEREST IN EGYPTOLOGY,

22:03.600 --> 22:04.734
SO YOU'RE ALREADY BANKING ON A

22:04.734 --> 22:05.800
PRETTY LARGE SUSPENSION OF

22:05.800 --> 22:08.266
DISBELIEF.

22:08.266 --> 22:09.834
OH, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW:

22:09.834 --> 22:11.700
LUNA WAS HIRED DURING THE LAST

22:11.700 --> 22:13.834
RECRUITMENT SURGE.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.200
AND CBP WILL TELL YOU WHAT THEY

22:15.200 --> 22:16.633
TOLD US, THAT "WHILE SOME AGENTS

22:16.633 --> 22:17.266
DID DISGRACE THE BADGE WITH

22:17.266 --> 22:19.033
CORRUPTION, THE VAST MAJORITY

22:19.033 --> 22:20.100
DID NOT."

22:20.100 --> 22:21.467
ALTHOUGH IT IS WORTH KNOWING

22:21.467 --> 22:23.200
THAT TOMSHECK, THE INTERNAL

22:23.200 --> 22:24.600
AFFAIRS GUY, BELIEVES THE

22:24.600 --> 22:25.467
PROBLEM IS BIGGER THAN THEY

22:25.467 --> 22:26.467
IMPLY.

22:26.467 --> 22:29.800
>> MR. LUNA IS NOT ONE BAD

22:29.800 --> 22:30.567
APPLE.

22:30.567 --> 22:32.533
HE IS PART OF A RATE OF

22:32.533 --> 22:36.500
CORRUPTION THAT EXCEEDED THAT OF

22:36.500 --> 22:37.600
ANY OTHER U.S> FEDERAL LAW

22:37.600 --> 22:38.967
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.100
>> John: SO IT'S LESS "ONE BAD

22:40.100 --> 22:42.200
APPLE" THAN "OH MY GOD, THIS IS

22:42.200 --> 22:43.767
A LOT OF BAD APPLES."

22:43.767 --> 22:45.400
WHICH, BY THE WAY, SHOULD BE THE

22:45.400 --> 22:46.266
MARKETING THEME FOR

22:46.266 --> 22:47.700
"RED DELICIOUS APPLES."

22:47.700 --> 22:48.900
"RED DELICIOUS APPLES: WELL, AT

22:48.900 --> 22:50.100
LEAST WE GOT THE 'RED' PART

22:50.100 --> 22:52.567
RIGHT!"

22:52.567 --> 22:55.467
AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

22:55.467 --> 22:56.233
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THESE AGENTS

22:56.233 --> 22:58.600
HAVE GUNS.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.367
AND THEY HAVE MADE SOME BAD

22:59.367 --> 23:00.033
DECISIONS.

23:00.033 --> 23:01.233
AND YOU MAY HAVE SEEN COVERAGE

23:01.233 --> 23:02.433
OF SOME OF THE TRAGIC INCIDENTS.

23:02.433 --> 23:03.467
>> IN A STRING OF SHOOTINGS BY

23:03.467 --> 23:04.166
THE BORDER PATROL THAT HAVE

23:04.166 --> 23:05.367
STIRRED UP EMOTIONS AT THE

23:05.367 --> 23:07.667
BORDER, THERE'S ONE CASE IN

23:07.667 --> 23:09.500
PARTICULAR THAT HAS BECOME A

23:09.500 --> 23:11.266
RALLYING CRY FOR JUSTICE, A

23:11.266 --> 23:13.066
SHOOTING OF A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY

23:13.066 --> 23:14.467
NAMED JOSE ANTONIO ELENA

23:14.467 --> 23:15.667
RODRIGUEZ.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.033
>> THEY SAY THEIR AGENTS WERE

23:17.033 --> 23:18.333
THREATENED BY SOMEBODY THROWING

23:18.333 --> 23:20.633
ROCKS ON THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE,

23:20.633 --> 23:21.633
BUT STANDING HERE, THE FIRST

23:21.633 --> 23:24.233
THING YOU ASK YOURSELF IS COULD

23:24.233 --> 23:26.033
A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY REALLY

23:26.033 --> 23:28.200
THREATEN SOMEBODY STANDING ON

23:28.200 --> 23:29.700
TOP OF WHAT'S AT LEAST A 20 FOOT

23:29.700 --> 23:30.333
CLIFF AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

23:30.333 --> 23:32.467
THAT FENCE?

23:32.467 --> 23:36.367
>> John: YEAH, THAT DOES SEEM

23:36.367 --> 23:37.133
PRETTY UNLIKELY.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.300
AND TO EXPLAIN WHY, TUNE IN NEXT

23:38.300 --> 23:39.066
WEEK, WHERE OUR MAIN STORY WILL

23:39.066 --> 23:40.300
BE GRAVITY.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.000
ARCHNEMESIS TO THE CONCEPT OF

23:41.000 --> 23:42.767
"UP."

23:42.767 --> 23:43.967
NOW, SO YOU KNOW: THAT CASE IS

23:43.967 --> 23:45.066
STILL IN THE COURTS.

23:45.066 --> 23:46.867
AND AGENTS CAN SOMETIMES FEEL

23:46.867 --> 23:48.300
THREATENED BY ROCK THROWERS.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.533
BUT IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT

23:50.533 --> 23:51.834
A REPORT WHICH LOOKED AT 25

23:51.834 --> 23:53.600
CASES WHERE BORDER PATROL AGENTS

23:53.600 --> 23:55.667
SHOT PEOPLE WHO'D THROWN ROCKS

23:55.667 --> 23:56.867
CONCLUDED THAT "TOO MANY CASES

23:56.867 --> 23:58.000
DO NOT APPEAR TO MEET THE TEST

23:58.000 --> 23:59.433
OF OBJECTIVE REASONABLENESS WITH

23:59.433 --> 24:02.567
REGARD TO THE USE OF DEADLY

24:02.567 --> 24:03.367
FORCE."

24:03.367 --> 24:05.600
WHICH I BELIEVE IS

24:05.600 --> 24:07.133
LAW-ENFORCEMENT-SPEAK FOR "HOLY

24:07.133 --> 24:08.333
SHIT, YOU SHOT AT SOME PEOPLE

24:08.333 --> 24:09.633
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE FUCKING SHOT

24:09.633 --> 24:11.166
AT.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.467
MAYBE DON'T DO THAT AS MUCH?"

24:13.467 --> 24:16.533
OH, AND THERE IS ONE MORE THING

24:16.533 --> 24:17.333
ABOUT THE AGENT IN THAT

24:17.333 --> 24:18.300
FENCE-SHOOTING THAT WILL NOT

24:18.300 --> 24:19.600
SURPRISE YOU.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
>> HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS

24:21.600 --> 24:22.800
HIRED BY THE BORDER PATROL

24:22.800 --> 24:27.667
DURING THE SURGE.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.900
>> John: OF COURSE HE WAS.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.266
AND YET, DESPITE ALL THESE

24:30.266 --> 24:31.000
WARNING SIGNS, WE'RE ABOUT TO

24:31.000 --> 24:32.033
EMBARK ON ANOTHER AMBITIOUS

24:32.033 --> 24:33.233
BORDER PATROL HIRING SURGE.

24:33.233 --> 24:34.700
AND CBP WILL TELL YOU NOT TO

24:34.700 --> 24:35.934
WORRY -- THAT, IN RECENT YEARS,

24:35.934 --> 24:37.166
THEY'VE IMPROVED HIRING AND MADE

24:37.166 --> 24:38.834
REFORMS.

24:38.834 --> 24:40.266
FOR INSTANCE, THEY'VE SLIGHTLY

24:40.266 --> 24:41.400
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY, AND

24:41.400 --> 24:43.133
GIVEN AGENTS MORE NON-LETHAL

24:43.133 --> 24:44.300
WEAPONS, LIKE PEPPER SPRAY GUNS,

24:44.300 --> 24:45.300
AS WELL AS REWRITING THEIR

24:45.300 --> 24:46.300
USE-OF-FORCE RULEBOOK TO -- AND

24:46.300 --> 24:48.033
I QUOTE -- PROHIBIT THE SHOOTING

24:48.033 --> 24:49.266
OF SUSPECTS FLEEING THE SCENE

24:49.266 --> 24:50.400
WHO DO NOT POSE A THREAT TO

24:50.400 --> 24:56.166
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

24:56.166 --> 24:56.967
THAT IS GREAT!

24:56.967 --> 24:58.200
ALTHOUGH IT DOES SEEM TO BE ONE

24:58.200 --> 24:59.400
OF THOSE RULES YOU SHOULDN'T

24:59.400 --> 25:00.967
HAVE HAD TO WRITE DOWN.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.734
IF YOU WENT TO A ZOO AND THERE

25:02.734 --> 25:03.900
WERE A GIANT SIGN THAT SAID

25:03.900 --> 25:05.100
"PLEASE DON'T FINGER THE

25:05.100 --> 25:06.900
ARMADILLOS," YOU WOULD WONDER

25:06.900 --> 25:09.600
WHAT THE FUCK HAD HAPPENED

25:09.600 --> 25:14.500
BEFORE THAT SIGN WENT UP.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.633
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

25:17.633 --> 25:18.934
MANY OTHER REFORMS HAVE NOT BEEN

25:18.934 --> 25:19.533
MADE, AND IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

25:19.533 --> 25:20.266
THAT THEY WILL BE, NOW THAT

25:20.266 --> 25:21.266
PRESIDENT GRAVY-DRUGS IS IN

25:21.266 --> 25:22.400
CHARGE.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.400
IN FACT, WORRYINGLY, THERE'S

25:23.400 --> 25:24.567
ALREADY BEEN TALK THAT HIRING

25:24.567 --> 25:25.700
STANDARDS MIGHT DROP AGAIN, WITH

25:25.700 --> 25:26.767
SUGGESTIONS LIKE A SHORTER

25:26.767 --> 25:29.133
POLYGRAPH, OR REMOVING PARTS OF

25:29.133 --> 25:30.066
THE ENTRANCE EXAM.

25:30.066 --> 25:31.333
AND MOST FRUSTRATING OF ALL,

25:31.333 --> 25:32.600
THERE MAY BE NO REASON FOR US TO

25:32.600 --> 25:34.767
TAKE THIS RISK AT ALL, BECAUSE A

25:34.767 --> 25:36.934
REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR

25:36.934 --> 25:38.400
GENERAL FOR HOMELAND SECURITY

25:38.400 --> 25:39.633
QUESTIONS WHETHER WE EVEN NEED

25:39.633 --> 25:41.367
5,000 MORE BORDER PATROL AGENTS.

25:41.367 --> 25:42.433
AND YET, TRUMP SEEMS DETERMINED

25:42.433 --> 25:46.500
TO DO THIS.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.667
WHO KNOWS WHY.

25:48.667 --> 25:50.467
THERE IS A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE HE

25:50.467 --> 25:52.533
ONLY SAID 5,000 BECAUSE SOMEONE

25:52.533 --> 25:54.000
TOLD HIM FIVE BRAZILIAN IS NOT A

25:54.000 --> 25:56.800
REAL NUMBER.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
AND LOOK: WHATEVER YOUR FEELINGS

25:57.800 --> 25:58.734
ABOUT THE LAWS THE BORDER PATROL

25:58.734 --> 25:59.633
HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ENFORCE --

25:59.633 --> 26:01.533
AND I HAVE PLENTY -- YOU WANT

26:01.533 --> 26:02.500
THE BEST POSSIBLE PEOPLE

26:02.500 --> 26:03.367
ENFORCING THEM.

26:03.367 --> 26:04.967
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T, AS WE'VE

26:04.967 --> 26:07.533
SEEN, BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.300
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT THE DANGER

26:09.300 --> 26:10.667
OF NOT LEARNING FROM YOUR

26:10.667 --> 26:12.200
MISTAKES.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.467
AND FOR THE SAKE OF ABSOLUTELY

26:13.467 --> 26:15.300
EVERYBODY -- PEOPLE ON BOTH

26:15.300 --> 26:16.767
SIDES OF THE BORDER, AND THE

26:16.767 --> 26:18.100
GOOD BORDER PATROL AGENTS JUST

26:18.100 --> 26:19.700
TRYING TO DO A DIFFICULT JOB

26:19.700 --> 26:21.200
WELL -- IF WE'RE GOING TO HIRE

26:21.200 --> 26:22.567
ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE, THE VERY

26:22.567 --> 26:24.467
LEAST WE CAN DO IS BE MORE

26:24.467 --> 26:26.700
CAREFUL THIS TIME AROUND.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.567
AND ONE TINY STEP WOULD BE TO

26:28.567 --> 26:29.834
HAVE RECRUITMENT ADS THAT SHOWS

26:29.834 --> 26:31.233
POTENTIAL AGENTS WHAT THE JOB IS

26:31.233 --> 26:36.266
"REALLY" LIKE.
