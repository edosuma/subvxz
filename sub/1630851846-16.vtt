Janeane!
Who the hell is this?

18:20.534 --> 18:22.935
You know I hate it
when you flirt with other men.

18:22.937 --> 18:25.137
Now, shut up forever
and kiss me.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.012
Whoo-hoo!
[ Glass shatters ]

18:33.014 --> 18:34.946
Your club is sick,

18:34.948 --> 18:37.883
and I mean that in the way
I think my son means it.

18:37.885 --> 18:39.351
A-plus inspection.

18:39.353 --> 18:41.753
That's great news.
Thank you for coming.

18:41.755 --> 18:43.355
Ooh, and I'd love
to get the number

18:43.357 --> 18:45.357
of that little lady
I met in the cabana.

18:45.359 --> 18:46.892
I didn't catch her name,

18:46.894 --> 18:51.096
but we didn't exactly do much
talking if yaknowwhaddamean.

18:51.098 --> 18:54.099
Yes!
We pulled it off!

18:54.101 --> 18:55.367
I don't understand.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.703
I succeeded, but I don't
have my confidence back.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.705
Well, Stan, it was more
of<i> my</i> success.

18:59.707 --> 19:04.844
Stan, why did you try
to torpedo our cemetery?

19:04.846 --> 19:07.779
Torpedo
is a underwater gun.

19:07.781 --> 19:10.449
You said we could decide things
for ourselves,

19:10.451 --> 19:13.252
but when we did, you hated
that we were succeeding.

19:13.254 --> 19:14.720
Of course I did!

19:14.722 --> 19:16.989
You were all doing so well
without me, and...

19:16.991 --> 19:18.590
I got scared.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.193
I started thinking maybe you
don't need Ol' Stanny-Two-Puns

19:21.195 --> 19:23.795
and his dumb decisions
to kick around anymore.

19:23.797 --> 19:26.666
But I swear, I wasn't trying
to sabotage you.

19:26.668 --> 19:27.867
Aww, Stan.

19:27.869 --> 19:30.536
You're more than just
your decisions to us.

19:30.538 --> 19:34.006
You're also the guy we get
to blame when they go wrong.

19:34.008 --> 19:35.274
We need that.

19:35.276 --> 19:37.543
Yeah, honestly, that was
a way easier system.

19:37.545 --> 19:41.413
Dad, we were sorta hoping maybe
you'd take the reins again.

19:41.415 --> 19:43.815
But it seemed like things
were going so well for you.

19:43.817 --> 19:45.617
You don't want to keep
doing your cemetery?

19:45.619 --> 19:46.818
We hated it!
So many guts!

19:46.820 --> 19:48.620
I think it's affecting
our groundwater.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.423
Well, I don't want to run
a club, especially with Klaus.

19:51.425 --> 19:54.960
Because you don't want business
to ruin our friendship?

19:54.962 --> 19:56.028
Was that an option?

19:56.030 --> 19:58.364
Baby,
we want you back.

19:58.366 --> 20:01.767
But of course,
it's your decision.

20:01.769 --> 20:03.302
I'll do it.

20:04.438 --> 20:07.239
Now, what are you gonna do
with all these bodies?

20:07.241 --> 20:08.908
Yeah, Dad,
what the hell?

20:08.910 --> 20:11.444
Don't worry.
I got this.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.780
You sure you're okay with this,
Scottie Pippen?

20:14.782 --> 20:17.383
You bet.
The sea will take care of me.

20:17.385 --> 20:20.652
That's why they always
call me "The Admiral."

20:20.654 --> 20:22.054
Wasn't that
David Robinson?

20:22.056 --> 20:23.522
Who knows?

20:23.524 --> 20:26.659
I will return when I have
written my next masterpiece.

20:30.664 --> 20:33.399
See?
Not all my ideas are bad.

20:33.401 --> 20:34.600
I got rid of the bodies,

20:34.602 --> 20:37.269
and we can be buried
in our own backyard.

20:37.271 --> 20:38.670
Two birds,
one stone.
