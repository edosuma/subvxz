WEBVTT

00:02.758 --> 00:05.275
[grinding]

00:11.724 --> 00:13.275
JOHNNY: Ooh, yeah, that's sharp.

00:14.310 --> 00:15.931
A safe axe is a sharp axe.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.172
You ready?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.482
Knowing how to make stuff is
important when you live this

00:22.551 --> 00:24.137
far away from society.

00:32.931 --> 00:35.068
JOHNNY: There's one hunting
tool that I think all hunters

00:35.137 --> 00:38.586
should know how to use and I
think that's a bow and arrow.

00:38.655 --> 00:40.413
And I'm gonna make a bow and
arrow from what I have laying

00:40.482 --> 00:43.206
around my camp.

00:43.275 --> 00:46.310
This log right here I'm
gonna turn into the riser,

00:46.379 --> 00:48.068
which is the handle part.

00:48.137 --> 00:49.310
Gotta cut it down a
little bit 'cause it's

00:49.379 --> 00:51.103
way too big and cumbersome.

00:51.172 --> 00:55.068
So, this will be essentially
a takedown recurve bow.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.931
I've never made a bow before.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.620
But if something was to
happen where I lost a gun or

01:04.689 --> 01:07.827
I ran out of ammunition,
when times call for it,

01:07.896 --> 01:10.689
you gotta know how to make
hunting tools because out here

01:10.758 --> 01:14.482
there's nothing but
me to fend for myself.

01:15.344 --> 01:16.689
I hope this log works.

01:16.758 --> 01:18.586
I can see that
the grain's pretty twisted.

01:18.655 --> 01:20.758
It's almost a 30-degree twist.

01:20.827 --> 01:23.344
That's not necessarily
what I'm looking for,

01:23.413 --> 01:25.551
but I'm gonna take
some more bark off and

01:25.620 --> 01:28.103
see what's going on with it.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.206
It's important to see
what you can make with your

01:30.275 --> 01:33.275
hands from what's
around you from the land.

01:33.344 --> 01:36.620
That's what this experience is
all about, being resourceful.

01:40.965 --> 01:42.551
Let's check this guy out.

01:44.965 --> 01:46.344
It doesn't look too bad.

01:46.413 --> 01:47.655
I think it's gonna work.

01:47.724 --> 01:50.172
Went from a log to now,
a piece of lumber.

01:50.241 --> 01:52.448
And now I gotta take
it from a piece of lumber

01:52.517 --> 01:55.034
to a bow riser,
which will have a handle here.

01:55.103 --> 01:57.689
And then I can finish
making the bow and arrow.

02:01.517 --> 02:03.344
What the hell are you doing?

02:04.310 --> 02:05.586
Getting cozy?

02:09.068 --> 02:12.137
CHEVIE: Out here we live
a subsistence lifestyle.

02:12.206 --> 02:16.517
Trapping, hunting,
it's not about money.

02:16.586 --> 02:18.482
It's what the land provides.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.206
CHEVIE: And that's where
you get your riches from.

02:23.275 --> 02:25.206
Let's load up and see if we
can catch some blackfish.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.862
It's such a nice day.

02:30.793 --> 02:34.413
There's only one fish that
you could fish with a trap

02:34.482 --> 02:37.103
in the winter months
and that's the blackfish.

02:37.172 --> 02:38.931
And as the sun starts
getting higher in the

02:39.000 --> 02:41.827
skies the blackfish
holes start opening up.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.827
We need to get out there
and catch our supply of

02:45.896 --> 02:48.275
blackfish for the year.

02:48.344 --> 02:51.586
So, we have to share that food
with elders and the community.

02:56.862 --> 02:59.172
Sydney, grab me that ice pick.

02:59.241 --> 03:00.413
I'll check this ice
first and make sure

03:00.482 --> 03:02.896
it's safe, all right?

03:02.965 --> 03:05.689
Sometimes the ice is rotten
around blackfish holes, right?

03:05.758 --> 03:07.275
SYDNEY: Yeah.

03:10.103 --> 03:11.551
CHEVIE: My name's Chevie Roach.

03:11.620 --> 03:14.000
I grew up in Tok, Alaska,

03:14.068 --> 03:16.965
90 miles from
the Canadian border.

03:17.034 --> 03:21.620
I first came to Shageluk
when I was about 20 years old.

03:21.689 --> 03:23.689
Not only is it a really
harsh environment,

03:23.758 --> 03:25.448
but it's a really
giving environment too,

03:25.517 --> 03:28.034
but you have to
know when to get it.

03:30.620 --> 03:33.034
Those old guys say if
you can hit it twice then

03:33.103 --> 03:36.448
you can walk on it.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.068
You kids can come over
here but just don't go

03:38.137 --> 03:40.103
past right here, okay?

03:40.172 --> 03:41.344
SYDNEY: Okay.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.310
CHEVIE: Why don't
you guys grab a trap.

03:43.379 --> 03:46.206
We built two fish traps,
a traditional fish trap

03:46.275 --> 03:50.000
and a new more Western
style steel fish trap.

03:51.724 --> 03:53.344
Now you guys,
go on your knees,

03:53.413 --> 03:54.793
go in front of me.

03:54.862 --> 03:56.137
Now listen, what we've
learned about this ice, right?

03:56.206 --> 03:57.413
Go on your knees.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.206
SYDNEY: Uh-hmm.
CHEVIE: Kay, get closer.

03:59.275 --> 04:00.655
Now you guys are old enough,
you gotta respect where you're

04:00.724 --> 04:02.344
at but you also gotta
be confident, okay?

04:02.413 --> 04:04.482
Go ahead and push
it in a little bit.

04:07.517 --> 04:09.827
SONTA: Oh, it's moving down.

04:09.896 --> 04:11.206
Nice.

04:11.275 --> 04:12.482
SYDNEY: Yeah.

04:14.310 --> 04:16.310
CHEVIE: Let's get
this one in the water.

04:16.379 --> 04:19.103
SONTA: There's not many
people in our communities,

04:19.172 --> 04:20.862
our surrounding communities
that continue to make

04:20.931 --> 04:22.965
traditional fish traps.

04:23.034 --> 04:24.448
Okay, guys, this
is really exciting,

04:24.517 --> 04:27.586
this is the first time we've
had a fish trap like this

04:27.655 --> 04:29.448
traditionally made
for blackfish in many

04:29.517 --> 04:31.103
years from our area,

04:31.172 --> 04:33.689
so I'm really excited
you guys are here to see this

04:33.758 --> 04:35.931
and we'll see what we catch.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.827
I'm Sonta Hamilton Roach.

04:37.896 --> 04:40.206
I'm Deg Hit'an Athabaskan.

04:40.275 --> 04:44.103
My husband and I have three
kids and one on the way.

04:44.172 --> 04:46.172
I grew up in Shageluk.

04:46.241 --> 04:50.413
Living out here, it's a
responsibility to who I am as

04:50.482 --> 04:51.896
a Deg Hit'an person.

04:51.965 --> 04:55.551
It's a responsibility
to our kids.

04:55.620 --> 04:58.172
Let's put it in.

04:58.241 --> 05:02.482
But it's also a responsibility
that our ancestors gave us.

05:04.068 --> 05:06.172
Woo-hoo you're under
the ice, that's good.

05:06.241 --> 05:07.413
We'll see what we catch.

05:07.482 --> 05:08.827
CHEVIE: See if we get lucky.

05:08.896 --> 05:10.172
All right, let's just
let those traps sit and

05:10.241 --> 05:11.586
do what they do.

05:11.655 --> 05:13.793
They're gonna produce
for us while we're at home

05:13.862 --> 05:15.310
sleeping in our beds,
that's pretty cool.

05:15.379 --> 05:16.655
That's what traps do.

05:16.724 --> 05:19.000
SONTA: Cool, this
is exciting guys.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.448
ALEX: Since I moved
here to Deadman Lake.

05:24.517 --> 05:27.896
The cold is the most
dangerous thing I'm facing.

05:27.965 --> 05:30.758
Mother Nature always pushes me.

05:30.827 --> 05:33.689
The lessons she gives me always
make me better, you know.

05:36.275 --> 05:38.827
Okay, so this one might
be rotten, but, uh...

05:41.413 --> 05:43.413
Oh, it might be good.

05:48.103 --> 05:49.724
ALEX: Okay, that's pretty good.

05:49.793 --> 05:53.206
Cutting dry wood with an
axe is a little bit slower.

05:53.275 --> 05:54.896
I may use a saw
to finish here.

05:57.241 --> 05:59.551
Since I moved here, I've been
in the emergency zone with

05:59.620 --> 06:01.034
firewood the whole time.

06:01.103 --> 06:03.551
It's been pretty extreme;
the coldest winter I've had

06:03.620 --> 06:05.103
here in Alaska.

06:05.172 --> 06:07.344
If I'm gonna survive
next winter, like,

06:07.413 --> 06:08.620
I have to get this
wood now otherwise I'm

06:08.689 --> 06:10.896
just not gonna have wood.

06:10.965 --> 06:12.413
So, what I gotta do
is cut down trees,

06:12.482 --> 06:15.103
go ahead and split them
up and then they need to

06:15.172 --> 06:16.931
dry all summer.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.275
There we go.

06:18.344 --> 06:19.586
By the time that next
winter comes around...

06:19.655 --> 06:21.206
Whoa!

06:21.275 --> 06:22.931
That will be the best quality
firewood you can

06:23.000 --> 06:24.620
get in Alaska.

06:26.482 --> 06:28.862
But now is the time
I just gotta work.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.379
[chopping]

06:32.793 --> 06:35.965
The first time I did any
work I was 16 years old.

06:36.034 --> 06:38.344
My dad made me mow the lawn
and it was like the most

06:38.413 --> 06:40.586
challenging thing of my life.

06:40.655 --> 06:42.620
With a gas-powered push mower,

06:42.689 --> 06:45.137
it was so hard for me
'cause all I did before that

06:45.206 --> 06:47.413
was play video games.

06:47.482 --> 06:48.965
Oof!

06:50.344 --> 06:54.172
So, I want this
real big one here.

06:54.241 --> 06:56.172
It's got a split in the
middle because it's growing

06:56.241 --> 06:57.758
into two trees.

06:57.827 --> 07:00.551
I think this tree kinda grew
too big for his own britches.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.034
I think he's in great
pain so I'm gonna put him

07:02.103 --> 07:03.655
out of his misery.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.034
Pretty much any way I try
to make that tree fall,

07:07.103 --> 07:09.172
it's gonna hang
up on another one.

07:09.241 --> 07:12.000
So, I'm cutting down
some other trees first.

07:12.068 --> 07:13.896
I got this one out of the way.

07:13.965 --> 07:15.448
Now I can get that one,

07:15.517 --> 07:17.931
pull it towards the
one I just cut down.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.344
I gotta make sure I'm
not gonna hit any other

07:19.413 --> 07:20.827
ones with it too.

07:20.896 --> 07:23.965
So, it's kinda like I'm
doing a puzzle here.

07:24.034 --> 07:26.482
Playing Mother Nature's
video game.

07:29.275 --> 07:32.103
And that's kind of the big
boss I'm working towards.

07:33.551 --> 07:36.206
That could be half my
winter firewood right there.

07:37.655 --> 07:39.689
I think it's about to go.

07:41.172 --> 07:42.655
Perfect.

07:44.448 --> 07:47.517
Now big boss tree should
be able to come clean right

07:47.586 --> 07:49.034
to me here.

07:49.103 --> 07:51.724
It's got a nice
clear fall path.

07:51.793 --> 07:54.448
I'm set up to cut
that big tree down.

07:59.413 --> 08:02.068
It's just been kinda tough.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.586
Do I wanna live the
same way next winter as

08:03.655 --> 08:05.344
I did this winter?

08:05.413 --> 08:07.655
Nah, I wanna do
a little bit better.

08:09.896 --> 08:12.379
Nature always compels
me to do that.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.586
It's cracking a little bit.

08:19.413 --> 08:21.000
Oh, it's going.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.965
Oof!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.689
Well, that's, that's
probably the biggest birch tree

08:32.758 --> 08:34.137
I've ever cut down.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.103
This was the fun part,
now I got a mountain of

08:37.172 --> 08:38.931
work ahead of me.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.206
CHRIS: Everything's just
kinda held together with

08:43.275 --> 08:44.827
luck and hard work.

08:44.896 --> 08:46.862
Hope for the best.

08:46.931 --> 08:48.586
If only there was a book
written on how to build

08:48.655 --> 08:51.275
[bleep] without [bleep].

08:51.344 --> 08:54.551
'Cause that's what
we do out here.

08:54.620 --> 08:58.620
JESSI: I love the bathhouse,
but last night with that wind.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.758
It was kinda like
"Mr. Toad's Wild Ride" meets

09:00.827 --> 09:03.000
like,  Treehouse of Horrors.

09:03.068 --> 09:04.517
CHRIS: Yeah. No kidding.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.137
JESSI: I was like going with
the trees and creaking and I

09:07.206 --> 09:10.379
was just sure that whole thing
was gonna end up in the river.

09:10.448 --> 09:14.517
It's, I think it's time
to rebuild the bathhouse.

09:15.862 --> 09:18.000
CHRIS: Yeah, this is
what worries me the most.

09:19.103 --> 09:21.758
Just look underneath.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.551
You can see all the
band-aids I scabbed in there.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.862
JESSI: That's what's
holding this thing up.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.896
As soon as that ice thaws out
and spring comes and it rains,

09:29.965 --> 09:32.655
that's all gonna wash away.

09:32.724 --> 09:35.413
This thing here,
look at this space.

09:35.482 --> 09:37.137
That's far past band-aiding.

09:37.206 --> 09:42.034
We've been band-aiding this
thing for five or six years.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.482
CHRIS: I've been worrying
about this bathhouse for over

09:43.551 --> 09:44.758
a year now.

09:44.827 --> 09:46.172
Every time I'm in
this bathhouse I feel

09:46.241 --> 09:47.586
like that's it.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.517
We just gotta tear it down
before someone gets hurt.

09:49.586 --> 09:51.689
Well, let's start taking it
apart and see where we end up.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.000
JESSI: Where things fall down.
CHRIS: What was I doing here?

09:59.310 --> 10:01.137
JESSI: When Chris and
I built this bathhouse we

10:01.206 --> 10:02.793
were so stoked.

10:05.275 --> 10:08.068
Start taking this apart.

10:08.137 --> 10:12.000
It became like a real spa,
a real treat to have.

10:12.068 --> 10:14.965
It was a total turning
point for Chris and I

10:15.034 --> 10:16.862
out at the Cosna.

10:16.931 --> 10:18.931
Showering outside at 40 below,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.413
it's just not an option.

10:20.482 --> 10:22.827
You've got to have
an area that you can keep

10:22.896 --> 10:24.689
warm to bathe out here.

10:27.034 --> 10:28.724
Yeah. Kay.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.034
But it's way past repair.

10:34.103 --> 10:35.620
CHRIS: Come pick up right there.

10:35.689 --> 10:38.758
JESSI: Both of us?
In the bathhouse?

10:38.827 --> 10:40.034
CHRIS: Yeah, just push up
like right there and see if

10:40.103 --> 10:42.068
I can get this out.

10:42.137 --> 10:43.586
There it goes.

10:43.655 --> 10:46.620
JESSI: Woo! Here we go.

10:46.689 --> 10:47.793
Okay.

10:47.862 --> 10:49.586
CHRIS: I'll hand
it to you out here.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.758
Okay.

10:51.827 --> 10:54.448
JESSI: Nice. One full window.

10:54.517 --> 10:57.344
Definitely reusing these.

10:57.413 --> 11:00.068
A lot of the stuff that we use
out here I would've thought were

11:00.137 --> 11:04.793
absolute trash, but there's
no wasting anything out here.

11:07.206 --> 11:09.896
The meaning of trash
is totally different.

11:11.482 --> 11:13.379
It's just all inventory.

11:17.172 --> 11:19.344
All right, it's free.

11:19.413 --> 11:22.344
We're gonna reuse all
the glass 'cause that is a

11:22.413 --> 11:24.275
precious commodity
all the way out here.

11:27.206 --> 11:30.103
CHRIS: That thing got
stuck on this piece of wood.

11:30.172 --> 11:31.586
Yeah.

11:31.655 --> 11:34.000
JESSI: Ooh, load bearing.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.758
I have a feeling that's
gonna come toppling down.

11:35.827 --> 11:39.413
CHRIS: It might.
Hammer. Please.

11:39.482 --> 11:40.655
JESSI: Got you.

11:40.724 --> 11:42.965
Careful, love. Okay.

11:43.862 --> 11:45.620
Almost come down.

11:45.689 --> 11:47.172
Right and...

11:56.103 --> 11:57.793
CHRIS: Like that.
JESSI: Very nice.

11:59.724 --> 12:01.551
CHRIS: Oh, hi, Toze.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.448
All right.

12:03.517 --> 12:05.517
JESSI: Let's try to take off
and be as easy as we can on

12:05.586 --> 12:07.758
what's remaining on the floor.

12:07.827 --> 12:08.896
CHRIS: Okay.

12:11.275 --> 12:13.551
JESSI: Like to use as much as
we can from the old bathhouse

12:13.620 --> 12:16.068
just 'cause I
loved it so much.

12:16.137 --> 12:19.379
You know, everything out here
has got its own character.

12:19.448 --> 12:22.827
Having our bathhouse made with
all of these reused materials,

12:22.896 --> 12:25.827
these are all wonderful
gifts from the past.

12:25.896 --> 12:27.655
CHRIS: Ooh!
Look at this, Jess.

12:29.068 --> 12:30.896
Go ahead and pull this out.

12:30.965 --> 12:32.000
JESSI: Ooh.

12:32.068 --> 12:33.413
CHRIS: With like two fingers.

12:33.482 --> 12:34.689
That was nothing.

12:34.758 --> 12:35.862
JESSI: Aw, that was nothing.

12:35.931 --> 12:37.551
Look at that.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.758
CHRIS: We were moments
away from going down.

12:39.827 --> 12:43.896
JESSI: Yeah, I mean,
that's pretty bad.

12:43.965 --> 12:46.517
Next step will be building
a new bathhouse, right?

12:50.344 --> 12:52.827
JOHNNY: This isn't
town life where everything's

12:52.896 --> 12:55.448
set up for you.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.103
Everything out here
wants you to fail.

12:57.172 --> 12:58.724
It's natural selection.

12:58.793 --> 13:00.379
You just gotta find your way.

13:00.448 --> 13:03.241
You gotta navigate through it
all and figure out your place.

13:10.620 --> 13:14.758
JOHNNY: I have the block of
wood that I manufactured from

13:14.827 --> 13:18.034
a log and now it's time
to carve this into the

13:18.103 --> 13:21.344
handle of the bow,
better known as a riser.

13:24.758 --> 13:28.034
It's kind of a long process
of just shaping, manipulating,

13:29.137 --> 13:31.689
sawing, chipping,

13:33.241 --> 13:35.275
but eventually it will take,
take its shape and

13:35.344 --> 13:37.137
take its form.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.413
This is the riser of
the bow that I'm making,

13:42.482 --> 13:44.379
and I just got done
carving out the handle which

13:44.448 --> 13:46.275
is right here.

13:46.344 --> 13:48.620
I got a little window that
I can see so when I pull the

13:48.689 --> 13:53.551
string back, I can see
what I'm shooting at.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.793
The next thing I gotta do here
is strap some limbs on it.

14:03.068 --> 14:04.724
That's where these come in.

14:04.793 --> 14:09.448
I'm gonna use these old,
useless cross-country skis

14:09.517 --> 14:11.206
that were given to me.

14:11.275 --> 14:13.413
I knew I could make
something with them out here.

14:20.241 --> 14:24.689
This is how old these are,
they're made in Yugoslavia.

14:24.758 --> 14:27.793
Yugoslavia is not
even a country.

14:27.862 --> 14:29.896
These skis you know, they
could be sitting in a landfill

14:29.965 --> 14:32.758
just rotting but
there's no use in that.

14:32.827 --> 14:37.275
So, to take them and repurpose
them and give them new life?

14:37.344 --> 14:40.724
To me these are
Alaskan attributes.

14:40.793 --> 14:44.310
Just having the skills and
the knowledge to make hunting

14:44.379 --> 14:47.724
tools I think is important to
have in my back pocket should

14:47.793 --> 14:50.103
something go wrong.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.379
I think it's done.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.551
Oh yeah.

15:01.620 --> 15:03.206
It's pretty sweet.

15:03.275 --> 15:05.379
Yup, I'm gonna wrap this up
for today and tomorrow I'm

15:05.448 --> 15:08.586
gonna come back out,
put a string across here,

15:08.655 --> 15:10.965
make a couple of arrows
and fling some of 'em.

15:11.034 --> 15:13.965
Hopefully it will shoot good.

15:14.034 --> 15:16.551
Java are you gonna help me
carry these tools inside?

15:16.620 --> 15:17.965
Don't give me those eyes.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.310
What's wrong with you?

15:22.137 --> 15:25.827
SONTA: Here in Shageluk,
we're a very remote community.

15:25.896 --> 15:28.689
It's the last Deg Hit'an
village on the Innoko River.

15:32.724 --> 15:36.344
The only way to access
Shageluk is really by air,

15:36.413 --> 15:39.586
by boat, or by snow
machine in the winter.

15:50.758 --> 15:51.931
CHEVIE: I think
we made the right call not

15:52.000 --> 15:53.413
bringing the kids.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.862
SONTA: How is it?

15:58.931 --> 16:01.034
CHEVIE: It's a little soft,
but just wanna make sure it

16:01.103 --> 16:03.344
doesn't open up by
that hole there.

16:04.448 --> 16:06.689
It's really warm.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.655
SONTA: It definitely is
really soft compared to just

16:08.724 --> 16:10.275
yesterday even.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.000
CHEVIE: Yup. Come on.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.172
Fish trap.

16:17.241 --> 16:21.275
I know there's a lot of people
waiting for some blackfish.

16:21.344 --> 16:25.000
So, people been asking,
so we gotta keep on fishing,

16:25.068 --> 16:26.896
I guess.

16:26.965 --> 16:30.827
To survive out here
in the winter months we
have to catch blackfish,

16:30.896 --> 16:33.275
and as a hunter and
gatherer it's part of

16:33.344 --> 16:36.103
your responsibility to
give to those that don't

16:36.172 --> 16:38.655
hunt or gather.

16:38.724 --> 16:42.448
The more you give the
more you'll get back.

16:42.517 --> 16:43.724
You want me to shovel that
out or are you, are you.

16:43.793 --> 16:44.724
SONTA: Yeah, maybe.

16:44.793 --> 16:46.206
CHEVIE: Okay.

16:46.275 --> 16:47.206
SOTNA: I'm just a little
leery about going so close.

16:47.275 --> 16:48.551
CHEVIE: All right.

16:48.620 --> 16:50.206
SONTA: You don't want
your pregnant wife down,

16:50.275 --> 16:51.586
getting all soaking wet.

16:51.655 --> 16:53.103
CHEVIE: Yeah. No.

16:57.034 --> 16:58.724
Okay.

17:01.827 --> 17:03.517
SONTA: Let's see.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.103
Not a thing!

17:07.172 --> 17:10.586
CHEVIE: Not a damn thing.
Maybe this is a bad spot.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.310
SONTA: Let's go
check yours out now...

17:13.379 --> 17:14.620
CHEVIE: Let's see what happens.

17:14.689 --> 17:16.000
SONTA: Just to see what
happens with yours.

17:21.620 --> 17:24.517
Exciting, let's see.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.000
A lot of elders are waiting
to see what we got.

17:37.172 --> 17:41.344
SONTA: Action Jackson?
CHEVIE: I don't think so.

17:41.413 --> 17:43.758
SONTA: Oh, really?

17:43.827 --> 17:46.413
You got some of
them beetles again.

17:47.413 --> 17:48.586
CHEVIE: Totally skunked,

17:48.655 --> 17:49.896
I don't see one
little blackfish...

17:49.965 --> 17:52.482
SONTA: You're skunked
on both sides today.

17:52.551 --> 17:54.931
Them beetles are
moving around though.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.689
CHEVIE: You could eat those,
too, in a pinch.

17:57.758 --> 17:59.448
SONTA: Yeah, throw 'em
in the deep fryer.

17:59.517 --> 18:00.862
CHEVIE: Couldn't
convince me to eat 'em.

18:00.931 --> 18:02.137
SONTA: I would.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.413
CHEVIE: Yeah, my ass.
SONTA: I would!

18:04.482 --> 18:06.000
CHEVIE: Let's find
another place to fish.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.413
SONTA: Yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.620
CHEVIE: We've caught
fish here in the past,

18:19.689 --> 18:22.310
we found this place again.

18:22.379 --> 18:25.034
We're gonna try to get
everybody enough blackfish.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.034
What's going on
with that trap?

18:40.103 --> 18:41.586
SONTA: It looks pretty loose.
CHEVIE: It is, yeah.

18:41.655 --> 18:43.689
SONTA: Yeah.
Need to tighten it up.

18:46.310 --> 18:48.896
I wonder if we could just, if
this rope will be any good for

18:48.965 --> 18:52.413
a temporary fix to
just close it up a bit.

18:54.172 --> 18:57.551
Subsistence is a way of
life for native people here.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.413
It might be kind of difficult,
you know the weather

19:00.482 --> 19:02.758
conditions are bad and
it's not comfortable.

19:02.827 --> 19:05.103
But after a while you see
that your hard work pays off.

19:09.586 --> 19:10.655
CHEVIE: I think that's
pretty good, don't you?

19:10.724 --> 19:12.275
SONTA: Yeah.

19:14.448 --> 19:18.103
CHEVIE: Blackfish tomorrow.
SONTA: Blackfish nation.

19:23.551 --> 19:26.724
ALEX: You know sometimes life
here is so hard that you just

19:26.793 --> 19:29.137
want to move somewhere else.

19:29.206 --> 19:32.344
But uh, it's definitely
never boring.

19:32.413 --> 19:33.689
You know 'cause I can't say I,

19:33.758 --> 19:35.413
I've never had
a boring winter here.

19:38.103 --> 19:40.517
Gotta be careful.

19:40.586 --> 19:43.517
Uh, one missed swing with
an axe you cut your leg.

19:43.586 --> 19:49.275
And, uh, if I cut
my leg bad even a,

19:49.344 --> 19:53.517
even a helicopter might
not be enough to save me, so.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.965
ALEX: Now is the real work.

19:57.034 --> 20:00.172
What I gotta do today
is process all these trees.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.137
This is a big one.

20:03.827 --> 20:06.758
Okay I think the rest of this
we'll just cut off with a saw.

20:08.172 --> 20:11.103
So, the sawing is
really monotonous.

20:11.172 --> 20:15.068
A bow saw takes about ten
times as long as a chainsaw.

20:15.137 --> 20:18.689
If I did it that way, yeah,

20:18.758 --> 20:22.000
I would get the work done
faster but it doesn't create

20:22.068 --> 20:24.206
a need for me
to change myself.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.655
By using the manual tools,

20:32.793 --> 20:35.551
I had to learn to
be more patient.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.620
Let my body go on auto pilot.

20:38.689 --> 20:41.068
Just let the arm just
go and go and go.

20:41.137 --> 20:43.137
Okay, last one here.

20:43.206 --> 20:44.931
Because the work
has to get done.

20:46.517 --> 20:48.448
Biggest one.

20:48.517 --> 20:51.551
It's gonna take a while.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.137
Let me see if I
can wedge that,

20:53.206 --> 20:56.068
it might just a little
bit left and then I can

20:56.137 --> 21:00.655
just break it.

21:00.724 --> 21:02.896
I have to have the firewood,
otherwise I'm going to die.

21:02.965 --> 21:06.655
So, I'll find a way to
become more patient.

21:08.827 --> 21:10.000
[laughs]

21:11.551 --> 21:13.862
It's a lot more
working cutting through
this than I'm used to,

21:13.931 --> 21:15.275
but I know it's going
to pay off because that's the

21:15.344 --> 21:19.413
best wood you can get here
in Alaska is this birch, so.

21:19.482 --> 21:21.344
[sighs]

21:21.413 --> 21:24.206
All right, so just
grab all these pieces,

21:24.275 --> 21:27.034
load them on my sled, I
can set up a chopping block

21:27.103 --> 21:30.724
station over here and just
to get this tree done.

21:30.793 --> 21:33.827
Saw out the next one,
split it so they can dry out.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.103
It's thousands and thousands
of pounds that I have to move,

21:41.172 --> 21:43.758
you know just one
sled load at a time.

21:43.827 --> 21:46.413
If I want to get better
wood I gotta do more work.

21:46.482 --> 21:48.896
There's, like, no freebies.

21:50.931 --> 21:52.793
Son of a [bleep].

21:54.310 --> 21:56.655
I gotta make sure that I
give myself the best chance

21:56.724 --> 21:59.586
possible for this wood to dry
out and be ready for next year.

22:02.310 --> 22:05.517
Whew, all right splitting time.

22:15.758 --> 22:17.724
All-righty.

22:17.793 --> 22:20.344
That's a pretty good
start right there.

22:22.482 --> 22:25.655
So, this is, this,
this was the big boss tree.

22:25.724 --> 22:27.482
Now it's all firewood.

22:29.620 --> 22:33.413
That's one tree down,
I got three to go.

22:38.862 --> 22:42.724
JESSI: Learning stuff out
here just by trial and error

22:42.793 --> 22:44.931
is so much more rewarding.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.448
Than learning something
in a classroom.

22:47.517 --> 22:50.172
Because this is
nature's classroom,

22:50.241 --> 22:52.482
and she's the best
teacher there is.

22:54.965 --> 22:57.310
I'm glad you're doing
this and I'm not.

23:06.034 --> 23:07.965
JESSI: I'm right here
if you need anything.

23:09.862 --> 23:16.275
Whew! Great!
Wow, look at that.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.103
CHRIS: Any other
ones or is that it?

23:19.172 --> 23:20.724
JESSI: I think that's it.

23:20.793 --> 23:22.310
CHRIS: Okay.

23:24.827 --> 23:27.206
CHRIS: All right.
Get to work?

23:27.275 --> 23:28.793
JESSI: Yeah, let's
get the roof up.

23:28.862 --> 23:32.586
I wanna get this thing done.

23:32.655 --> 23:35.896
Everything that we have out
here is reused or recycled.

23:37.724 --> 23:41.241
Or will be reused and recycled
in one way or the other.

23:41.310 --> 23:44.241
I mean, this tin is
older than the house is.

23:44.310 --> 23:46.689
CHRIS: Kay,
slide it a little bit.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.413
That's some real [bleep].

23:48.482 --> 23:50.413
JESSI: It was probably
sent to the Cos Jacket

23:50.482 --> 23:53.655
sometime between 1920 and 1950.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.310
And then, it was repurposed
multiple times and it found

23:56.379 --> 24:00.862
its way 50 miles up the Cosna,
right here at our homestead.

24:00.931 --> 24:02.413
CHRIS: There it is.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.103
JESSI: Great.

24:04.172 --> 24:06.862
Where'd you learn to
cut tin like that, love?

24:06.931 --> 24:08.517
CHRIS: Believe it or not when
I was an apprentice

24:08.586 --> 24:11.344
at the state.

24:11.413 --> 24:13.241
JESSI: Good ol' Alaska.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.931
CHRIS: There we go.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.413
How's that fit?

24:24.482 --> 24:26.137
JESSI: Great.
CHRIS: Looks great.

24:26.206 --> 24:28.793
JESSI: Okay, so
we just need to figure
out how to nail that in.

24:31.793 --> 24:33.689
CHRIS: Oh, this
isn't sketch at all.

24:33.758 --> 24:35.344
JESSI: Yeah...

24:35.413 --> 24:37.379
Most amount of sketch.

24:38.758 --> 24:40.862
CHRIS: Wow this is
a [bleep] spot, huh?

24:40.931 --> 24:43.103
I don't think it's
going anywhere.

24:43.172 --> 24:44.620
I don't think it
can go anywhere.

24:50.344 --> 24:52.793
Oh, yeah, perfect.

24:52.862 --> 24:54.103
JESSI: Legit?

24:54.172 --> 24:56.068
CHRIS: Eh, I wouldn't
use those words.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.827
Kay, go ahead and
take the ladder out.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.482
Much better.

25:06.551 --> 25:08.034
JESSI: Ooh.

25:08.103 --> 25:09.482
CHRIS: What's wrong?

25:09.551 --> 25:11.689
JESSI: Just the spot that
your, you know, foot's on.

25:11.758 --> 25:13.206
CHRIS: I'm trying to
put, get down, too.

25:13.275 --> 25:14.724
JESSI: Okay, great.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.896
Just don't put all of your
weight on that top branch.

25:16.965 --> 25:19.172
CHRIS: I'm not.

25:21.758 --> 25:23.724
Watch out!

25:23.793 --> 25:25.827
Kay, well, unfortunately I
think I have to get up on this

25:25.896 --> 25:28.965
roof which I'm not
super stoked about.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.413
JESSI: Not much
holding you up, love.

25:33.482 --> 25:35.275
CHRIS: No [bleep].

25:38.482 --> 25:40.275
Hey, Jess, how's
everything look down there?

25:40.344 --> 25:41.862
Is everything moving?
I can't see anything,

25:41.931 --> 25:43.379
and I don't like
being on this.

25:43.448 --> 25:45.068
But it looks pretty solid?

25:45.137 --> 25:46.551
JESSI: It's looking
pretty stout, I think.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.896
CHRIS: Okay,
gonna kinda come out on it.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.655
Oh, my God I'm
terrified of heights.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.034
[groans].

25:58.275 --> 25:59.448
CHRIS: Okay.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.965
Do you wanna hand
me that piece up?

26:01.034 --> 26:03.172
Or, put it in place
there, whatever.

26:08.551 --> 26:10.517
Okay.

26:10.586 --> 26:12.965
The name of the
game here, displace my weight.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.448
I'm gonna lay down on this,
but I want you to come out in

26:14.517 --> 26:18.482
case I die, I don't
kill you as well.

26:18.551 --> 26:20.517
JESSI: In case I die
you don't come with me.

26:20.586 --> 26:21.896
CHRIS: Yeah.

26:21.965 --> 26:23.551
Tell me if you see
anything start to move,

26:23.620 --> 26:26.000
but I'm pretty displaced here.

26:29.137 --> 26:30.241
Awesome.

26:30.310 --> 26:33.862
Got it. Nice.

26:33.931 --> 26:36.965
I'm just gonna chuck my
hammer down, watch your head.

26:37.034 --> 26:38.241
JESSI: Where are you?

26:38.310 --> 26:40.103
Okay.

26:40.172 --> 26:42.103
CHRIS: I'm up on
top of the roof.

26:45.482 --> 26:48.344
JOHNNY: I take on challenges
out here 'cause it
keeps my mind occupied,

26:48.413 --> 26:50.275
it keeps my mind safe.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.655
You can't be holed up in
your cabin with a book and

26:52.724 --> 26:55.310
a warm fire...

26:55.379 --> 26:56.931
It's unrealistic.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.758
Java, come on.

27:03.482 --> 27:05.965
All right, so the next part
for the bow and arrow project

27:06.034 --> 27:07.931
is the arrows.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.448
The fletchings
are the feathers,

27:09.517 --> 27:11.655
those are from some
ducks that I harvested

27:11.724 --> 27:13.000
earlier in the year.

27:13.068 --> 27:15.172
Wanna cut these down to size.

27:17.620 --> 27:20.068
I'm using willow sticks
because they grow straight and

27:20.137 --> 27:23.000
they're lightweight.

27:23.068 --> 27:25.517
I'm gonna skin these arrows
and get all the little buds

27:25.586 --> 27:28.655
and stuff that might cause
drag when they're flying

27:28.724 --> 27:30.965
through the air, and just try
to make them a little bit more

27:31.034 --> 27:33.000
cylindrical and straight.

27:36.448 --> 27:40.103
I think it'd be, you know,
a dream come true if I could

27:40.172 --> 27:43.034
make a bow that I could
actually hunt with.

27:43.103 --> 27:44.620
I think that'd be amazing.

27:44.689 --> 27:46.620
You know the first deer
that I'd ever harvested

27:46.689 --> 27:49.655
was with a bow and arrow.

27:49.724 --> 27:53.137
I'm removing the,
the bark off of these,

27:53.206 --> 27:56.448
and the more I remove
it the thinner they get.

27:56.517 --> 27:59.206
I'm thinking they're
gonna be too thin.

27:59.275 --> 28:01.310
Fool me once, fool me twice.

28:01.379 --> 28:02.517
I'm gonna pivot.

28:02.586 --> 28:04.310
I'm gonna remove
these from the table.

28:04.379 --> 28:08.724
I've got some stuff laying
around the cabin that could

28:08.793 --> 28:10.344
potentially work so
I'm gonna have a peek.

28:12.793 --> 28:14.517
These are both
pretty straight.

28:19.344 --> 28:21.310
Cool.

28:21.379 --> 28:24.379
So, when I made hunter
skis earlier in the winter,

28:24.448 --> 28:27.172
they were pretty wide,
and I cut a chunk off,

28:27.241 --> 28:28.482
and that's what this is.

28:28.551 --> 28:30.344
And I'm gonna start
kind of shaping it down,

28:30.413 --> 28:32.448
hopefully getting more
of an arrow-like shape,

28:32.517 --> 28:33.827
more cylindrical.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.310
When I was a little kid,

28:41.379 --> 28:44.103
I used to make bows
with just a stick.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.931
I would find a curved stick
and I would tie rubber bands

28:47.000 --> 28:50.275
for the string.

28:50.344 --> 28:51.965
And try to shoot
little sticks, you know,

28:52.034 --> 28:53.689
ten feet or
something like that.

28:53.758 --> 28:55.344
I did it all the
time as a little kid,

28:57.586 --> 28:59.793
and here I am doing
it as an adult.

28:59.862 --> 29:01.241
How cool is that?

29:05.620 --> 29:07.103
Yeah, I think it's gonna fly.

29:12.172 --> 29:14.931
Arrows are complete.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.310
Make some good target
practice arrows.

29:17.379 --> 29:19.482
I really want to shoot 'em.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.965
Yeah, I'm excited
to shoot these.

29:21.034 --> 29:22.655
I'm excited to try these out.

29:27.448 --> 29:30.310
ALEX: Like if I'm in the
city for a little bit.

29:30.379 --> 29:33.241
And then I come back out here,
the first thing I notice is

29:33.310 --> 29:35.965
that I'm almost
never sitting here.

29:36.034 --> 29:38.551
Pretty much everything
I do is exercise.

29:40.931 --> 29:44.068
The wood won't dry at
all if it's getting wet
all year long, you know?

29:52.862 --> 29:55.068
So, my wood's protected.

29:55.137 --> 29:56.827
Uh, now I'm just
gonna grab my axe,

29:56.896 --> 29:59.931
and I'm gonna go get
some spruce poles.

30:01.758 --> 30:05.413
So, I've done all this hard
work to prepare for next winter.

30:05.482 --> 30:08.310
Now I can focus
on my next task.

30:10.413 --> 30:12.344
So, I'm gonna try and
make a homemade teepee.

30:12.413 --> 30:14.896
If I'm gonna be, you know,
more like a subsistence hunter

30:14.965 --> 30:17.310
what I need to do is be
able to travel a lot.

30:17.379 --> 30:19.241
I'm gonna need lots of camps
down at different places that

30:19.310 --> 30:20.344
I travel to.

30:20.413 --> 30:22.551
There's one.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.172
So, I might have a fish camp.

30:24.241 --> 30:26.413
I might have a
moose hunting camp.

30:32.827 --> 30:35.000
Uh, in order to travel
well I want to make sure

30:35.068 --> 30:37.620
I got a good portable
shelter to take with me.

30:39.724 --> 30:41.517
[sighs]

30:41.586 --> 30:43.310
Gonna need a couple tools.

30:43.379 --> 30:45.827
Grab my tarp, grab some cord,

30:47.137 --> 30:49.275
and then I'll get
this kinda tripod made.

30:51.137 --> 30:52.758
I've never made a teepee,

30:52.827 --> 30:54.758
and so it's good to
test it out here at camp

30:54.827 --> 30:57.551
first before I go out
into the field with it.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.068
Well, this won't
be good enough,

30:59.137 --> 31:01.137
but I'm just gonna kinda,
just wanna kinda play with it

31:01.206 --> 31:04.000
and see how it's gonna work.

31:05.724 --> 31:08.620
The whole thing is
it should it's something
that should be able to,

31:08.689 --> 31:11.965
I can carry it on
sleds easily, you know.

31:12.034 --> 31:15.379
Even with this really simple
lashing right there I can

31:15.448 --> 31:17.551
probably go ahead and
put the canvas on it,

31:17.620 --> 31:19.551
just to kind of get
a sense of the size.

31:22.206 --> 31:23.931
I don't wanna be
a masochist down here.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.172
I like to work hard.

31:25.241 --> 31:28.793
I like to throw myself
into the elements,

31:28.862 --> 31:31.827
but I wanna overcome
them and find ways to

31:31.896 --> 31:33.689
be comfortable in them.

31:33.758 --> 31:35.620
So, that's the whole point
of doing these preparations.

31:40.931 --> 31:42.827
That's really tiny.

31:42.896 --> 31:44.137
That's like an outhouse.

31:44.206 --> 31:46.172
It's way too small.

31:46.241 --> 31:47.931
Obviously, the teepee's
been around forever.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.034
I don't think a
teepee's a bad idea,

31:49.103 --> 31:50.931
but just given
the materials I have

31:51.000 --> 31:52.793
I don't think it makes sense.

31:52.862 --> 31:56.137
Now I got over
100 pounds of stuff.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.448
And it's not gonna make sense
for what I'm actually trying

31:58.517 --> 31:59.793
to accomplish.

31:59.862 --> 32:01.241
So, I'm gonna have to
compromise a little bit.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.275
So, I'm just gonna grab
a few more tools and, uh,

32:03.344 --> 32:05.241
and then test it out.

32:09.172 --> 32:11.724
CHEVIE: Out here you're just a
drop in the bucket compared to

32:11.793 --> 32:14.896
all the natural resources
that provide for us.

32:14.965 --> 32:17.275
That allow us to be
able to do the things that

32:17.344 --> 32:18.689
we love to do,

32:18.758 --> 32:20.137
because everything
we love to do is right

32:20.206 --> 32:21.827
out our front door.

32:29.862 --> 32:31.655
SONTA: This is definitely
more the time to do

32:31.724 --> 32:33.793
some blackfish trapping.

32:33.862 --> 32:36.931
Because things are melting and
so it's a really good time to

32:37.000 --> 32:39.724
access the good fishing spots.

32:39.793 --> 32:43.620
I'm always interested in being
able to put food on the table

32:43.689 --> 32:46.896
in some way and blackfish
is a very awesome resource.

32:48.517 --> 32:50.827
We'll see what we
get today everybody.

32:50.896 --> 32:56.551
CHEVIE: What do you see?
SONTA: Well, I don't know.
CHEVIE: How does your net look?

32:56.620 --> 32:59.241
SONTA: Good!
At least it survived,
I'm happy about that.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.724
Should we check it out?

33:04.103 --> 33:05.034
Oh!

33:05.103 --> 33:06.413
SYDNEY: And nothing.

33:06.482 --> 33:07.965
SONTA: Nothing at all.

33:08.034 --> 33:10.068
So, we probably just have
to go a little deeper,

33:10.137 --> 33:13.068
so we should check yours first
and see if deeper is better.

33:13.137 --> 33:15.413
CHEVIE: Yeah, we'll see,
hopefully I got something.

33:17.103 --> 33:19.689
SYDNEY: Let's see what
yours will have.

33:21.172 --> 33:22.965
SONTA: Feel heavy?

33:27.379 --> 33:28.551
CHEVIE: All right, there we go.

33:28.620 --> 33:29.896
SYDNEY: Yes!

33:29.965 --> 33:31.413
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

33:31.482 --> 33:35.275
SONTA: Oh, good! Wow!
That's what we're looking for.

33:35.344 --> 33:37.862
CHEVIE: That's what we're
looking for, right there.

33:39.172 --> 33:41.172
It was a huge success.

33:41.241 --> 33:43.241
All right, it looks
like we probably got

33:43.310 --> 33:45.655
50 fish or so, I bet.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.034
And at the end of it,
it's always a win.

33:48.103 --> 33:51.862
There's not a failure when
you try new productive things;

33:51.931 --> 33:54.586
especially with
our kids involved.

33:54.655 --> 33:55.931
SONTA: Sydney, what do
you think about fishing

33:56.000 --> 33:57.068
in the wintertime?

33:57.137 --> 33:59.275
SYDNEY: I think it's awesome.

33:59.344 --> 34:01.068
SONTA: Ready to go see grandpa
and bring him some fish?

34:01.137 --> 34:02.793
SYDNEY: Yeah!

34:06.206 --> 34:09.344
JESSI: Everywhere you
look around the Cosna,

34:09.413 --> 34:12.103
you're surrounded by
all of this beauty,

34:12.172 --> 34:15.965
and all of these lines that
kind of move around and twist

34:16.034 --> 34:18.827
and turn just like
the river itself.

34:26.275 --> 34:30.172
CHRIS: Got this random
beam in here to deal with.

34:34.793 --> 34:38.275
Just gonna kinda trace around
it a little bit to kind of.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.827
JESSI: Are we gonna put
a hole through our wall?

34:42.551 --> 34:44.241
Eh, I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.965
CHRIS: All right.

34:50.034 --> 34:52.137
JESSI: Let's just remember
this mess that you did.

34:52.206 --> 34:53.482
This hole.

34:53.551 --> 34:55.862
CHRIS: It's not my fault
that beam's out there.

34:58.586 --> 35:01.000
JESSI: Oh my.

35:03.137 --> 35:05.586
Even though we're just
building a bathhouse,

35:05.655 --> 35:07.517
this is just how things go.

35:07.586 --> 35:09.448
CHRIS: Where'd you go?
JESSI: I'm right here.

35:09.517 --> 35:10.896
You know, we don't
know what we're doing.

35:10.965 --> 35:13.448
We're doing kinda
trial-and-error out here.

35:13.517 --> 35:15.448
I don't know what
else to say, I mean,

35:15.517 --> 35:19.793
maybe it just would be
too plain without that hole
coming out through the side.

35:19.862 --> 35:21.172
CHRIS: Okay.

35:24.379 --> 35:25.689
JESSI: Okay.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.724
Here I am, worried that
we're gonna be too city.

35:29.793 --> 35:30.827
[chuckles]

35:32.793 --> 35:34.482
CHRIS: Beautiful chaos.

35:36.310 --> 35:37.689
JESSI: Check out what
I brought home from the

35:37.758 --> 35:39.241
hardware store, love.

35:39.310 --> 35:40.517
CHRIS: Damn, that's
a triple-pane, man.

35:40.586 --> 35:41.896
JESSI: Oh, okay.

35:41.965 --> 35:43.344
CHRIS: That's like
what goes in a cabin, man.

35:43.413 --> 35:46.206
That's like a,
that's a really nice window.

35:46.275 --> 35:48.103
JESSI: It's a really
nice bathhouse.

35:48.172 --> 35:49.413
CHRIS: It's not that nice.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.103
JESSI: Oh.

35:51.172 --> 35:53.000
CHRIS: I like
that funky thing.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.620
That came out of
the old bathhouse.

35:54.689 --> 35:55.896
Put it in here.

35:55.965 --> 35:57.206
That looks like
the perfect size.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.517
This one'll mount up.

36:02.586 --> 36:05.620
JESSI: Um, if we can get
that, that would be cool.

36:05.689 --> 36:07.137
CHRIS: I can get that in.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.896
JESSI: Awesome.

36:09.965 --> 36:11.448
The bathhouse is
coming together.

36:11.517 --> 36:14.172
It has its little
eccentricities and just these

36:14.241 --> 36:15.620
little things about it.

36:17.482 --> 36:18.827
Nothing's straight.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.172
CHRIS: What do you think?

36:20.241 --> 36:23.931
JESSI: It's
wonderfully eclectic.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.448
CHRIS: Are you using big words
because you know I don't know

36:25.517 --> 36:26.965
what it means?

36:27.034 --> 36:29.310
JESSI: Oh, no, I know what
those words mean, love.

36:29.379 --> 36:30.344
CHRIS: I don't.

36:30.413 --> 36:31.586
JESSI: Eclectic?

36:33.758 --> 36:35.758
Nothing is perfectly level.

36:35.827 --> 36:39.724
Everything is angled in,
kind of, the wrong way,

36:39.793 --> 36:42.896
but that's not what
the Cosna has ever been.

36:44.724 --> 36:47.000
We are moments away.

36:47.068 --> 36:48.379
This is perfect.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.793
This will be really great
for when it gets cold,

36:50.862 --> 36:54.586
and we need to get
a roaring fire in here
and have a bathhouse.

36:58.413 --> 37:00.586
JOHNNY: Alaska ignites
a lot within my soul.

37:00.655 --> 37:06.310
It gives me an opportunity
to live a life free of a lot of

37:06.379 --> 37:08.620
stuff that's weighed
me down in my past.

37:16.827 --> 37:19.931
JOHNNY: The string I'm
using for this bow is

37:20.000 --> 37:21.758
just micro-paracord.

37:24.758 --> 37:27.068
I don't know if it's gonna
work but there's only one way

37:27.137 --> 37:28.448
to find out.

37:28.517 --> 37:30.103
It's what I have laying
around the cabin,

37:30.172 --> 37:34.172
and that's what this
bow-build is all about.

37:44.758 --> 37:46.793
And the bow's done.
It's complete.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.103
Oh, yeah.

37:52.724 --> 37:55.206
So, I'm ready to grab my
arrows, grab my target,

37:55.275 --> 37:57.137
head down to the lake
and start flinging some arrows

37:57.206 --> 37:59.448
at that target.

38:01.344 --> 38:04.448
I take on challenges out here
'cause it keeps my mind busy.

38:04.517 --> 38:06.931
You know, it keeps my mind safe.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.862
'Cause that's how you
have to live out here.

38:08.931 --> 38:10.758
The lifestyle is
getting out there.

38:10.827 --> 38:12.482
It's just about
challenging yourself,

38:12.551 --> 38:15.241
seeing what rejects
you and what doesn't.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.448
I'm just setting
up the target.

38:17.517 --> 38:19.655
It's pretty windy
out here right now,

38:21.620 --> 38:24.172
probably not the best day to
be using a bow and arrow for

38:24.241 --> 38:27.275
the first time but I'm
pretty excited to try it out,

38:27.344 --> 38:29.827
so I'm just gonna go with it.

38:29.896 --> 38:32.310
Try this bad boy out.

38:32.379 --> 38:35.724
It's been a lot of
work making this thing.

38:35.793 --> 38:38.896
I spent endless hours
carving out this handle,

38:38.965 --> 38:41.275
cutting up these old skis,
and I'm ready to start

38:41.344 --> 38:43.344
shooting some arrows.

38:48.275 --> 38:50.172
I hope it's gonna shoot good.

38:58.172 --> 39:02.172
♪ ♪

39:02.241 --> 39:04.379
JOHNNY: All right,
it's not a bullseye,
but that's a target hit.

39:04.448 --> 39:06.206
I'll take it.

39:08.172 --> 39:09.172
Let's try another one.

39:12.413 --> 39:14.793
Woo-hoo!

39:14.862 --> 39:17.758
It's a cool feeling
to string up that arrow,

39:17.827 --> 39:19.344
pull it back,

39:19.413 --> 39:22.379
and just kinda feel that
arrow sliding along my finger.

39:25.689 --> 39:27.137
It's awesome.

39:27.206 --> 39:29.034
It's really cool, a really
good feeling to know that I

39:29.103 --> 39:30.965
can construct a bow from
just what I have laying

39:31.034 --> 39:32.448
around my camp.

39:35.172 --> 39:38.172
You ready? Come on. Let's go.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.689
SONTA: A really important
part that we do in our culture

39:46.758 --> 39:48.344
is giving that food away.

39:48.413 --> 39:50.655
We bring that to elders
in the community and their

39:50.724 --> 39:53.827
grandparents who are
really thankful for it.

39:53.896 --> 39:56.620
GRANDPA HAMILTON:
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for the fish.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.931
Some were way bigger?

40:01.000 --> 40:02.206
SONTA: Oh, wow.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.862
RYDER: Okay, I'm cold.

40:03.931 --> 40:05.275
GRANDPA HAMILTON: Looks good,
thank you, thank you.

40:05.344 --> 40:07.310
SYDNEY: Welcome.

40:07.379 --> 40:09.241
SONTA: It's really great to
see the kids interact with

40:09.310 --> 40:12.310
their grandpa and see the
joy on their grandpa's face

40:12.379 --> 40:13.793
when they brought it to him.

40:13.862 --> 40:16.034
And so that generational
exchange is always really

40:16.103 --> 40:17.586
exciting to see.

40:17.655 --> 40:18.827
Say goodnight, Grandpa.

40:18.896 --> 40:20.206
SYDNEY: Goodnight, Grandpa.

40:20.275 --> 40:21.827
GRANDPA HAMILTON:
Okay, goodnight. Thank you.

40:21.896 --> 40:23.724
SONTA: Thank you.

40:25.034 --> 40:27.000
Are you guys excited
to try some blackfish?

40:27.068 --> 40:28.827
KID: Yes.
SYDNEY: Yeah.

40:28.896 --> 40:30.724
SONTA: This is really
a delicacy that those elders

40:30.793 --> 40:32.724
love to have.

40:32.793 --> 40:34.413
So, let's see
what happens, huh?

40:36.413 --> 40:38.000
CHEVIE: It's always cool to
know where your food came from

40:38.068 --> 40:39.379
and how you got it.

40:39.448 --> 40:41.413
Instead of pulling it out
of a plastic wrapper.

40:43.551 --> 40:46.413
The steel trap ended up
catching a lot more fish,

40:46.482 --> 40:48.758
but we learned a lot more
about that traditional trap

40:48.827 --> 40:50.620
than we did the steel trap so.

40:50.689 --> 40:51.965
SONTA: Yeah, for sure.

40:52.034 --> 40:53.172
CHEVIE: We're
gonna be able to, uh,

40:53.241 --> 40:55.310
make it better the next time.

40:55.379 --> 40:59.068
SONTA: Looking good.
They're ready to eat.

41:00.793 --> 41:03.862
Self-sufficiency and hard
work is one of the values of

41:03.931 --> 41:09.413
Athabascan people and to see
that knowledge passed down,

41:09.482 --> 41:12.206
it's really important.

41:12.275 --> 41:14.103
CHEVIE: I expect all of
that blackfish to be gone,

41:14.172 --> 41:15.724
just like that hot chocolate.

41:17.448 --> 41:20.931
SONTA: Out here,
building, hunting,

41:21.000 --> 41:25.517
nothing is really
seen as a failure but
an opportunity to improve.

41:27.896 --> 41:31.068
JESSI: Check it out.
Boom. Boom. Boom.

41:31.137 --> 41:34.034
Yeah. Totally doable.

41:38.517 --> 41:40.172
All right, ready?

41:40.241 --> 41:42.034
CHRIS: Uh-hmm.
JESSI: From here.
CHRIS: Yep.

41:42.103 --> 41:44.896
JESSI: Over to here, right?

41:44.965 --> 41:46.689
CHRIS: Yep.
I'll get it cut out.

41:48.068 --> 41:50.517
Our first time we had
this was like utilitarian.

41:50.586 --> 41:52.068
We needed it done.

41:52.137 --> 41:54.413
We needed to have a shower,
but now having a bathhouse is

41:54.482 --> 41:57.275
almost like our symbol of
our livelihood out here.

41:58.655 --> 42:01.241
It's pretty cool.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.413
It's like a jack-o-lantern.

42:03.482 --> 42:04.586
JESSI: It is.

42:04.655 --> 42:05.965
CHRIS: That you
worked on one side,

42:06.034 --> 42:07.758
and I worked on the other.

42:07.827 --> 42:10.482
JESSI: I think
it's looking great.

42:10.551 --> 42:11.758
CHRIS: When I was a young man,

42:11.827 --> 42:13.862
I wanted to have
a really good job,

42:13.931 --> 42:17.724
a wife, and kids, do
the normal American thing.

42:17.793 --> 42:20.103
That seemed really
important to me,

42:20.172 --> 42:22.551
and the more time I spend
with Jessi and the more time

42:22.620 --> 42:24.827
we spend out at the Cosna,
I'm starting to realize that

42:24.896 --> 42:28.551
there's a lot more to life,
and that's just living.

42:28.620 --> 42:30.206
JESSI: Christopher.

42:32.586 --> 42:34.172
ALEX:
That's what it's all about.

42:35.482 --> 42:36.896
Just living.

42:38.103 --> 42:41.793
So, I got a few
kinda things here.

42:41.862 --> 42:44.241
In order to do
a proper teepee,

42:44.310 --> 42:46.655
I'll need some materials
that I just don't have here.

42:46.724 --> 42:49.172
These heavy tarps
aren't gonna work.

42:49.241 --> 42:51.724
So, I was just hit
with an inspiration,

42:51.793 --> 42:53.413
I'll do an A-frame.

42:53.482 --> 42:55.793
So, I think I can do
this with just one tarp,

42:55.862 --> 42:57.689
and then just a few ropes.

43:01.689 --> 43:04.068
The big thing about Alaska
is you're always getting

43:04.137 --> 43:05.827
ready for the future.

43:05.896 --> 43:08.344
I mean that's why I admire
the indigenous people

43:08.413 --> 43:10.482
who lived here before
European settlers.

43:11.862 --> 43:13.517
I don't think there's any
other people in the world who

43:13.586 --> 43:16.137
had to think so far
ahead in time, you know?

43:18.482 --> 43:20.275
A lot of times, if we're
talking about being prepared,

43:20.344 --> 43:21.724
you know, it just means,

43:21.793 --> 43:23.551
"Oh I gotta prepare for
that meeting next week or

43:23.620 --> 43:24.931
something like that, right?"

43:27.310 --> 43:29.379
But here you, you have
to think, you know,

43:29.448 --> 43:32.344
an entire year in advance
sometimes and if you don't...

43:32.413 --> 43:34.620
you can actually
get yourself into a dire

43:34.689 --> 43:38.206
almost unescapable situation.

43:42.413 --> 43:44.448
ALEX: And, uh, it's just
something I'll have to keep at,

43:44.517 --> 43:46.758
you know,
from year-to-year.

43:46.827 --> 43:50.344
So that's a simple shelter,
but what I like about it is

43:50.413 --> 43:52.482
all you gotta do is take
this tarp and this rope and,

43:52.551 --> 43:54.000
and that's it.

43:55.344 --> 43:56.793
You know, there's
no guarantees.

43:56.862 --> 43:57.896
Oh, yeah.

43:57.965 --> 43:59.793
But, you know,
if I wanted things where

43:59.862 --> 44:01.310
there's a guaranteed outcome,

44:01.379 --> 44:03.310
I'd just stay home and
play video games, right?

44:05.931 --> 44:07.965
