00:55.156 --> 00:58.726
God, Crystal, you mean he
brings you breakfast in bed?

00:58.826 --> 01:01.162
How was it?

01:01.262 --> 01:04.932
No, I mean the breakfast.

01:05.032 --> 01:07.635
Well, of course Ed's going
to do something romantic.

01:07.735 --> 01:11.939
I mean, it's Valentine's
Day, for crying out loud.

01:12.039 --> 01:14.408
Only the slimiest
low life of a husband

01:14.508 --> 01:17.178
would forget you
on Valentine's Day.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.546
And he just came in.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.782
I got to go, bye.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.285
I didn't forget it.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.853
What did you get me?

01:25.953 --> 01:28.256
A surprise.

01:28.356 --> 01:31.525
To both of us, huh?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.460
Here.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.664
Well, at least
my son remembered.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.300
Happy Valentine's
Day from your son.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.201
Love Warren.

01:43.671 --> 01:44.505
Warren?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.440
The one I made was lousy.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.709
Well I would have love it
anyway, DJ, because you made it

01:48.809 --> 01:51.579
with your own two little hands.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.713
Is there gravy on this?

01:52.813 --> 01:55.916
What'd you do, fish
it out of the trash?

01:56.016 --> 01:56.817
Was that wrong?

01:59.753 --> 02:00.654
Keep going, Deej.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.756
You're making the
old man look good.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.659
No, it's not too late if he
asked you today, tomorrow even.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.760
It doesn't
matter, because he's

02:06.860 --> 02:07.961
not going to ask me anyway.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.763
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.365
Who ain't going to
ask you anyway what?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.267
Can we just eat
breakfast, please?

02:13.367 --> 02:14.235
Well, come on, Darlene.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.336
We're all gathered together.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.105
This is the perfect
time to get caught up.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.073
Yes, mother, and there
are three other people here

02:20.174 --> 02:21.942
to get caught up on.

02:22.042 --> 02:22.843
OK.

02:22.943 --> 02:23.977
Dan, you going to work today?

02:24.077 --> 02:24.878
Yup.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.046
DJ, you got scouts?

02:26.146 --> 02:26.947
Yes.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.816
Becky, you still blonde?

02:28.916 --> 02:29.717
Yeah.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.520
So, Darlene, what's going on?

02:32.620 --> 02:35.122
You know, it's just like you
to get all gross about this.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.458
I mean, how come you can't
talk about me behind my back

02:37.558 --> 02:38.459
like a normal mother?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.062
OK.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.531
Let's do it.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.399
His name is Barry.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.900
JACKIE: Hi, guys.
- Oh!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.337
Get in here, Jackie.
Darlene's got a boyfriend.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.571
You're kidding.
Who?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.105
This guy she met
playing basketball.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.207
He's a sophomore.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.475
Oh, he's an older man.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.576
Yeah.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.177
She really, really,
really wants him to ask

02:57.278 --> 02:58.746
her to Valentine's Dance.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.781
So I told Darlene to invite
him over this afternoon

03:00.881 --> 03:02.650
to help her out with her math.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.218
I thought the
vulnerable, helpless girl

03:04.318 --> 03:06.687
approach would be better than
that Larry Byrd thing she does.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.655
Yeah.

03:07.755 --> 03:08.889
This better not
get out of control.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.424
I don't want to catch
them groping on the couch

03:10.524 --> 03:11.659
like with that last guy.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.794
This is completely
different, Dan.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.897
She didn't even
like that last guy.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.799
Oh, well then.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.168
Becky, what should I wear?

03:21.269 --> 03:23.136
I said the pink skirt.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.138
It's too short.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.941
She knows nothing.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.678
I don't like this whole
Darlene, pink skirt,

03:30.778 --> 03:32.112
boy, too short thing.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.848
Well, I don't like
this whole husband,

03:34.948 --> 03:38.286
stupid, forget Valentine thing.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.188
I didn't forget.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.089
OK, DJ.

03:42.189 --> 03:42.990
Come on.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.859

Day anyhow, honey.

you're off the police force--

04:01.208 --> 04:02.009
OK.

04:02.109 --> 04:02.910
I forgot.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.478
Help me out here.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.846
What does she want?

04:05.946 --> 04:08.349
Oh, Dan, I'm sure whatever
you pick out would be--

04:08.449 --> 04:09.283
Tell me!

04:12.686 --> 04:13.854
- Lingerie.
- No.

04:13.954 --> 04:14.922
No.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.024
Dan, she says you
never buy her anything

04:17.124 --> 04:18.959
that makes her feel sexy.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.962
Hell, I bought
her cable didn't I?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.864
It's what she wants.

04:23.964 --> 04:24.765
How about jewelry?

04:24.865 --> 04:25.833
She loves jewelry.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.034
She doesn't have any
of her own, but she

04:27.134 --> 04:28.436
admires it on other people.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.572
You are just embarrassed,
because you think you're going

04:31.672 --> 04:33.341
to be the only man in
the lingerie store,

04:33.441 --> 04:35.142
and everybody's going
to be staring at you,

04:35.242 --> 04:38.712
and thinking you're
some kind of a pervert.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.782
You've been a great help.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.050

04:46.487 --> 04:47.588
I don't know.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.658
I mean, how am I even
going to know if it fits?

04:50.758 --> 04:51.559
Try it on.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.999

05:08.442 --> 05:09.242
Good brownies.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.346
Yeah.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.781
They have nuts in them.

They're good.

It's all those nuts.

She's fine.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.301
She's just got to relax.

Much better.

something to clean that up.

Well, you gotta show him
you're something special.

try flirting a little.

in and listen, like what

he's saying is important.

Lean in and listen?

06:26.754 --> 06:27.721
Yeah, like this.

trying to help you out.

OK.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.403
But he's gorgeous, isn't he?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.638
He's cute.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.539
Oh come on.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.741
He's a god.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.242
I mean this homework
thing is kind of lame,

he must like me, right?

you like you?

Right now, he's out
there with mom, alone.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.699
I don't know, but I
figure when your husband

07:11.799 --> 07:14.034
forgets Valentines Day you've
got a right to say something,

07:14.134 --> 07:14.935
you know.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.908
Oh sure, I don't want to go
busting his chops or nothing,

07:21.008 --> 07:23.243
but you know, I want
a little romance.

down a mine shaft?

Up on Big Rock Mountain?

08:05.218 --> 08:06.887
And grandpa's already
up there waiting.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.693
I better get out there.

08:12.793 --> 08:13.594
Good girl.

Your mom's nice.

This is my sister, Becky.
- Hi.

08:22.035 --> 08:22.836
Yeah.

08:22.936 --> 08:23.804
I've seen in school.

08:27.975 --> 08:31.378
Would you like
another brownie, Barry?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.280
No.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.750
Maybe I should take off.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.552
Hey, Barry, you
got your license yet?

08:38.652 --> 08:39.452
Uh-huh.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.788
I got it a couple of weeks ago.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.789
I'm waiting to get a car.

08:41.889 --> 08:42.690
Ah.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.662
ROSEANNE: What kind of car?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.134
Yeah, what she said.

08:54.234 --> 08:58.806
Well, my dream car is a red
Corvette with a turbo charger,

08:58.906 --> 09:02.242
but I'll probably wind up with
my dead aunt's old Gremlin.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.078
What is she doing?

09:05.178 --> 09:05.979
Flirting?

09:10.383 --> 09:14.154
Well God, I hope she
doesn't hurt herself.

09:14.254 --> 09:18.458
[harmonica music]

09:18.558 --> 09:20.628
You know, so we're
married 17 years,

09:20.728 --> 09:23.831
and he totally forgets
Valentine's Day.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.333
I'd divorce him if I were you.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.467
I'm not going to reward him.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.406
So did Duke get you anything?

09:33.506 --> 09:35.408
Oh, he's such a sweetheart.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.177
You know, there were a
lot of women in his life

09:37.277 --> 09:38.545
before we met.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.715
So for Valentine's Day he's
going to have all their names

09:41.815 --> 09:44.952
removed from his back.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.387
I'd kill for a guy like that.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.956
That's how I got him.

09:52.059 --> 09:52.860
Excuse me.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.027
Hello.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.263
I'd like to speak with
the manager, please.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.497
He's not here.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.199
He's never here.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.534
Well, then maybe that's why
they fired him and hired me.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.336
Hi.
Leon Karp.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.838
I'm your new boss.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.040
Which leads me to
my first question,

10:07.140 --> 10:08.208
why aren't you working?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.476
Nobody's asking for anything.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.414
Attitude.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.582
We'll cover that later.

10:15.683 --> 10:16.549
OK.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.450
New rules.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.418
You ready?

10:18.518 --> 10:19.486
All right.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.790
First, when your shift
starts, you start.

10:22.890 --> 10:27.661
If you're five minutes late,
you're docked five minutes pay.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.029
Wow.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.265
That's almost $0.30.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.166
Hey.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.267
I got to go to the bathroom.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.137
Here's a buck.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.972
That's very funny.

10:39.072 --> 10:39.873
Thank you.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.680
Now to continue on,
I've been hearing

10:46.780 --> 10:48.581
that the customers
like to come in here,

10:48.682 --> 10:51.351
because they enjoy themselves.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.353
That you're friendly, you chat.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.623
We think it's
our sexy uniforms.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.358
Why do you think this
restaurant is in the middle

10:58.458 --> 11:00.027
of this department store?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.262
It's because, when our
customers are hungry,

11:02.362 --> 11:04.497
we do not want them to leave.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.799
And after they've
eaten, we want to get

11:05.899 --> 11:06.800
them right back out there.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.168
So they can buy things.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.270
Well, do you want to be mean?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.205
Not, not mean.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.841
Brusque.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.643
That's going to
cut down on our tips.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.746
You're going to
make it up in volume.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.783
So you want us to work twice
as hard for the same money?

11:22.883 --> 11:25.485
That's great.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.453
OK.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.354
I got to go.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.559
Are you enjoying that coffee?

11:32.659 --> 11:33.961
Yes, I am.

11:34.061 --> 11:36.830
That's wonderful.

11:36.930 --> 11:37.765
Get her out of here.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.936
[elevator ding]

11:43.036 --> 11:44.571
Yeah, she is definitely cute.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.973
Well, you were right
there at her house,

11:46.073 --> 11:47.240
why didn't you ask her?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.175
Well, it was weird.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.409
Like her whole family was there.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.811
And her sister was
hanging out with us.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.746
Dance is tomorrow, bud.

11:52.846 --> 11:53.646
I don't know.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.348
I think she likes me.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.351
But I'm not sure.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.686
Oh God.

11:59.787 --> 12:00.587
What?

12:00.687 --> 12:02.923
That's her mother.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.892
No, guys, don't.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.693
Please.
- Hey!

12:06.794 --> 12:07.660
Hey, Mrs. Conner.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.262
Hey, it's Bar.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.364
Hey, so you guys
know what you want?

12:11.464 --> 12:14.634
Barry does.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.837
But she's not on the menu.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.205
I got to go.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.506
Oh, where are you going?

12:19.606 --> 12:20.440
Well, I can't stay here.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.341
It's too embarrassing.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.475
Oh, it is not.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.477
Now I know you like
my daughter, right?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.946
OK.
Yeah.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.214
OK.

12:27.314 --> 12:30.117
Now I'm a young, hip, happening
kind of a mother here,

12:30.217 --> 12:31.351
you know.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.587
I totally dig this
teen romance stuff.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.357
So that's why I'm going to
give you some advice, Barry.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.827
Call her, dude.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.228
It's more
complicated than that.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.262
I mean, Darlene--

12:42.362 --> 12:44.798
It is not complicated.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.133
- You sure?
- Yeah.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.700
Just promise me you'll
have a small wedding,

12:47.801 --> 12:48.701
and then you'll move away.

12:50.904 --> 12:51.704
Hello.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.006
This is Barry Parker.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.241
Is this Darlene?

12:54.341 --> 12:55.142
Just a second, Barry.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.076
I'll get her.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.545
Darlene!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.013
Hurry!

13:00.113 --> 13:01.014
It's him!

13:01.114 --> 13:02.082
BOTH: It's him!

13:02.182 --> 13:02.983
It's him!

13:03.083 --> 13:03.984
It's him!

13:04.084 --> 13:05.018
OK.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.286
I just became the
kind of girl I hate.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.187
Now give me the phone.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.225
Here she is, Barry.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.260
What?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.596
I said I wanted to
talk to you, Becky.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.432
Do you have a date for
the Valentine's Dance?

13:19.532 --> 13:22.202
Hey, Bonnie, I'm sleeping
over your house tonight.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.103
K?

13:26.173 --> 13:29.009
[harmonica music]

13:29.109 --> 13:31.144
Darlene, for the
millionth time,

13:31.244 --> 13:33.346
I was only down here with
you guys for like one minute.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.582
Exactly how did
I steal him away?

13:35.682 --> 13:36.649
Well hello there.

13:36.749 --> 13:39.352
Y'all going to be
driving some time soon?

13:39.452 --> 13:40.820
Oh, Darlene.

13:40.921 --> 13:41.721
I told you.

13:41.821 --> 13:42.655
He's not even my type.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.556
Oh what?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.524
He's not good enough for you?

13:44.624 --> 13:45.926
Well, let me tell you something.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.096
He's 50 times better than the
mutants that you go out with.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.031
Darlene, you're
not making any sense.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.132
I don't have to
make any sense.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.133
I just have to
remember to be a little

13:53.233 --> 13:54.601
more careful with
my boyfriends when

13:54.701 --> 13:57.770
my sister's feeling feisty.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.206
Mother.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.107
What's going on?

14:03.743 --> 14:07.247
Barry called and asked
me out, instead of Darlene.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.416
No.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.552
Would you tell her
I didn't do anything?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.221
- Darlene, you know, it's not--
- Oh yeah.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.355
Take her side,
like you always do.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.957
She's just your little Princess.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.191
What are you talking about?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.659
She never takes my side.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.660
We're always arguing.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.830
She makes my life miserable.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.065
Am I right?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.033
Well, I do what I can.

14:30.670 --> 14:31.771
I don't care what she says.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.406
You hated the idea that
I could have a boyfriend.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.441
You're nothing but a snake.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.309
Oh, I don't have
to take any of this.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.210
Yeah, right.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.578
Run away, Becky.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.915
Like you always do.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.817
You know, Darlene,
this isn't Becky's fault.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.320
Honey, this happens
to all girls.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.123
It really does, and I
promise it'll get better.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.491
Oh yeah, tomorrow's
another day.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.093
It's not the end of the world.
There's lots of other boys.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.194
Did I leave anything out?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.968
There's plenty
more fish in the sea.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.836
That about covers it.

15:03.937 --> 15:16.483
[music playing]

15:16.583 --> 15:19.987
What do you think, pervert?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.889
No, husband.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.224
He's starting to buckle.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.125
I got him.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.061
Hi.
- Hi.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.562
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.164
I'm, I'm just looking.
- I see.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.065
No.
I'm not looking.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.266
I didn't come in here to look.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.303
I mean, I don't enjoy
doing that kind of thing.

15:36.403 --> 15:40.173
I mean, why don't
you believe me?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.141
Something for your wife.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.042
Fine.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.176
For Valentine's Day?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.077
Thank you.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.278
Oh that's so sweet.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.381
Well, what do you think
she would do like?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.382
A Teddy?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.051
A nightie?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.185
How about a robe?
- Robe.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.086
Yeah.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.254
Yeah.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.289
Big, long robe.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.891
Do you want silk,
lace, see through?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.597
Could I have a glass of water?

16:04.697 --> 16:05.498
Amy.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.040
Good construction.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.074
Here you go, sir.

16:14.174 --> 16:14.974
Thank you.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.243
Would you like to sit down?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.144
Thank you.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.189
There, there.
Calm down.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.557
It's OK.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
Now I know you said a robe,
but I think this is something

16:32.325 --> 16:33.726
that she will really like.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.528
And see how sheer it is?

16:35.628 --> 16:36.896
Feel it.
- No.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.997
Oh come on, it won't bite.

16:38.098 --> 16:38.898
No, really.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.799
It's OK.

16:39.899 --> 16:40.700
Come on.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.868
I know you want to.

16:41.968 --> 16:45.205
It's wonderful, but I got to--

16:45.305 --> 16:47.307
Oh, excuse me.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.241
Sir, are you all right?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.509
No, I, I got to go.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.510
Something to do with my car.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.147
Arnie.
- Dan.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.382
Wow, listen man,
my car broke down.

16:55.482 --> 16:56.449
I came in here to use the phone.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.417
How's Rosie doing?

16:57.517 --> 16:58.318
Good.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.320
Bye.

17:00.420 --> 17:07.026
[music playing]

17:07.127 --> 17:09.596
Hey, Becky, how's that book?

17:09.696 --> 17:10.497
Incredibly boring.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.241
You know, Becky, it's not
your fault that that Barry

17:21.341 --> 17:22.975
kid asked you out or anything.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.645
I mean, you're very pretty,
and you're a sophomore.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.115
And you're comfortable
around boys.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.417
And you know, it's
not his fault either.

17:30.517 --> 17:33.320
And it certainly
isn't Darlene's fault.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.889
The book is better
than this, mother.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.692
Well, she really
needs you now, Becky.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.727
I'm not going to go up there.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.795
She's just going to
dump all over me.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.797
I know that, and then
she'll probably cry some more.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.933
And it's bound to be
an awful experience,

17:47.033 --> 17:50.570
and I'm glad I
won't be having it.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.272
So why should I?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.707
Because you're the big sister.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.344
You know, you get to date
first and drive first.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.512
You get to do everything first.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.148
And Darlene's
going to be killing

18:01.248 --> 18:03.015
herself her whole life just
trying to catch up to you,

18:03.116 --> 18:03.916
you know?

18:04.016 --> 18:05.952
Just give her a break.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.087
I mean, she needs somebody
to unload on right now,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.756
and this time I'm
just not good enough.

18:14.026 --> 18:18.097
This is very, very nice of me.

18:18.198 --> 18:21.268
I want big points.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.770
Well, I thought it was going
to be a truly selfless act,

18:23.870 --> 18:28.441
but then at the last
minute she pulled it out.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.478
Well, I was never trying
to catch up to you though.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.946
Oh, we, you wish you were me.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.215
No.
No.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.249
Get out of here.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.617
No.
No.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.651
No.
- Yeah.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.620
That was the burden
of my entire life,

18:40.720 --> 18:41.921
trying to hold myself back.

18:42.021 --> 18:42.855
Oh!

18:42.955 --> 18:45.225
So you wouldn't
feel overshadowed

18:45.325 --> 18:46.693
by my magnificence.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.495
You're dreaming.
No.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.496
No.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.530
Rosie, could I see you?

18:53.600 --> 18:54.867
He got it.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.068
- Oh.
- Oh.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.003
Yeah.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.238
Guilt is a many
splendored thing.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.008
Coming, dearest.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.415
Oh, you did get me something.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.317
For my wife, on
Valentine's Day.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.251
Oh.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.151
So nice.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.823
I made it with my
own two little hands.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.527
Oh, Dan.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.396
Well, Roseanne, I tried.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.499
I went to the underwear
store and everything.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.868
But people were
staring at me, leering.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.036
I felt so cheap.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.378
Dear Roseanne, though this
gift is not what you desired,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.613
the sentiment is clear.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.617
If you need proof I love
you still, hell, Rosie,

19:44.717 --> 19:47.854
I'm still here.

19:47.954 --> 19:48.755
Love, Warren.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.398
Oh, Dan, I know you really
do love me you old goat.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.435
I'm going to go try this on.

[harmonica music]

20:12.379 --> 20:14.180
Hey.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.148
Oh, hey.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.784
So, how was the dance?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.552
It was OK.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.687
You can tell me.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.323
I'm not going to like
break down or anything.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.726
It was really nice.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.695
Anybody there I might know?

20:28.795 --> 20:31.598
Barry showed up
with Angela Deets

20:31.698 --> 20:33.433
She looks just like you.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.368
That's so gross.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.769
Thanks.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.838
Well, you know what I mean.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.474
So did he like spend the
whole night gazing at you?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.843
Sort of.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.211
Did he ask you to dance?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.479
Uh-huh.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.980
So?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.617
So I thought what would
Darlene want me to do?

20:50.717 --> 20:53.353
So you punched
him in the neck?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.253
No.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.155
I just told him to get lost.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.860
But then I told Angela Deets
that she was his second choice.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.029
So what did she do?

21:03.129 --> 21:07.867
Well, let's just say old Bar
won't be dancing for a while.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.370
Cool.

21:10.470 --> 21:18.778
[theme - "roseanne theme"]

21:28.821 --> 21:32.692
[laughing]

21:39.732 --> 21:44.571
[snorting]

21:44.671 --> 21:46.072
You, you.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.107
I can't look at you.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.877
DARLENE: I can't
look at you either.
