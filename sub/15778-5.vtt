00:35.777 --> 00:37.711
Hey, Doc.

00:37.745 --> 00:39.872
Found something you
might be interested in.

01:05.072 --> 01:07.268
All right, what's so important that...

01:07.308 --> 01:10.175
- That's my shirt.
- Is it? Found it in that box.

01:10.211 --> 01:13.009
- Take it off. You're stretching it out!
- What do you care?

01:13.047 --> 01:14.514
It's been in a box for 20 years.

01:14.549 --> 01:16.210
Are you throwing this stuff out?

01:16.251 --> 01:18.845
'Cause who can't use
another sweater vest?

01:18.887 --> 01:21.378
- Cool guys?
- It's way too tight. You look ridiculous.

01:21.422 --> 01:23.083
- Yeah, you look great.
- Insults.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.718
That's why you called me away
from my spring cleaning?

01:25.760 --> 01:26.886
No. Check this out.

01:26.928 --> 01:29.988
Well, it's old, but we could
probably get a few bucks for it.

01:30.031 --> 01:32.556
- Good find.
- Not the camera, what I found inside it.

01:33.668 --> 01:34.726
Hello, Rusty...

01:34.769 --> 01:38.899
- It's grandpa! He's alive!
- And trapped in the phantom zone.

01:38.940 --> 01:41.340
I was just kidding.
Jezz, I'm not a 'tard.

01:41.376 --> 01:44.243
- You were always such a little video buff...
- Once!

01:44.279 --> 01:47.305
I told him <i>once</i> I wanted to make videos.
Next thing you know...

01:47.348 --> 01:49.714
every holiday
it's cameras, "How-to" books...

01:49.751 --> 01:53.812
See, pop, I've been meaning to tell you,
I'm not really that into neckerchiefs.

01:53.855 --> 01:56.449
- You wear them well.
- Wait. What did he say? Go back.

01:57.759 --> 02:01.718
What I have to tell you is a matter
of the gravest importance, Rusty.

02:01.763 --> 02:05.392
It has to do with those mysterious,
deep space radio signals.

02:05.433 --> 02:08.834
You know, the ones I received back
when you were just a boy.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.065
But what does it mean?

02:14.108 --> 02:17.077
You can't walk on the red ones
'cause they're lava.

02:17.111 --> 02:19.102
Rusty, please!

02:19.147 --> 02:24.949
Well, after ten long years,
I finally translated the broadcasts.

02:24.986 --> 02:27.784
I found something extraordinary!

02:27.822 --> 02:32.657
A message from far across time and space,
addressed to me personally.

02:32.694 --> 02:37.188
It has to do with my latest invention,
the greatest of my career or anyone's...

02:37.231 --> 02:39.222
which I completed only a week ago!

02:39.267 --> 02:40.598
Turn it up. I smell money.

02:40.635 --> 02:45.629
They warned me that mankind
was still too immature to be trusted with it.

02:45.673 --> 02:49.507
They told me to dismantle it
before it got into the wrong hands.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.638
But they also told me
that the fate of the planet...

02:52.680 --> 02:56.172
hinged upon my machine
being activated once.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.981
That's why I've scattered
the main components...

02:59.020 --> 03:03.184
in secret locations across the globe,
so no one...

03:03.224 --> 03:04.782
Someone's coming!
They know!

03:08.629 --> 03:11.655
False alarm.
OK. Get a pen.

03:13.067 --> 03:17.003
Once assembled, the device
must be activated at precisely midnight...

03:17.038 --> 03:20.735
in New York City,
on May 4 of your 44th year.

03:20.775 --> 03:24.370
- Doc, that's, like, tomorrow.
- Should I fail to live to see that day...

03:24.412 --> 03:27.904
it will be up to you, Rusty.
Good luck, Godspeed...

03:27.949 --> 03:30.679
and go, Team Venture!

03:30.718 --> 03:34.017
First base is on Spider Skull Island.
Damn it, my brother!

03:34.055 --> 03:37.115
- Big man.
- Yes, Dean, you're a big man now.

03:37.158 --> 03:40.093
Brock and I...
Ladysmith Black Mambazo!

03:40.128 --> 03:44.258
Step back! I have traveled
from an incredibly distant star...

03:44.298 --> 03:46.266
to observe the ways of your planet.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.530
- I can feel it in my chewies.
- You have the honor...

03:48.569 --> 03:51.538
of representing your entire race
as my sample subjects.

03:51.572 --> 03:54.541
There's a 12-foot man in our
pool pointing a beam at my head.

03:54.575 --> 03:56.736
- Do something?
- Whispering is futile!

03:56.778 --> 04:00.680
The Grand Galactic Inquisitor
hears all, sees all!

04:00.715 --> 04:03.513
Look, we don't have time for this, OK?
We're on a very tight...

04:03.551 --> 04:05.212
Do not speak to me!

04:05.253 --> 04:08.745
Do not alter your normal
human behavior in any way!

04:08.790 --> 04:12.521
You know not the elaborate criteria
by which you are to be judged.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.360
Ignore my presence
and go about your earthly business!

04:18.899 --> 04:22.130
Here are some hand turkeys
from Thanksgiving, 1968...

04:22.170 --> 04:24.104
and a bunch
of your old homeworks.

04:25.106 --> 04:28.303
Neat! You wrote a fan letter
to the <i>Herculoids</i> when you were ten?!

04:29.343 --> 04:32.244
Hey, horses!
It's not a fan letter.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.306
He calls them hippies
for not fighting in Vietnam.

04:35.349 --> 04:36.475
Ignore me!

04:36.517 --> 04:40.578
Swing around back and have
the X-2 running. I'll only be a minute.

04:40.621 --> 04:42.748
They'll never even know we were here.

04:54.202 --> 04:56.193
¿ <i>Qué es eso?</i>

05:02.610 --> 05:04.407
Ahoy!
Who goes there?

05:09.283 --> 05:11.308
Jeez, it's you people.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.219
- It's that ghost pirate again!
- Who isn't a ghost.

05:14.255 --> 05:16.951
- Or a pirate even really.
- What are you doing here?

05:16.991 --> 05:19.459
Yeah, well, you never
seem to use the boat...

05:19.494 --> 05:24.295
so I kinda started sleeping here,
only a couple of nights a week at first.

05:24.332 --> 05:27.790
You try finding a job with nothing
on your resume but fake ghost pirate.

05:27.835 --> 05:29.996
- Get to the point.
- Yeah, yeah, jeez.

05:30.037 --> 05:33.734
Anyhoo, I wakes up one day
and there's this little fella standing there...

05:33.774 --> 05:37.301
and he tells me it's his boat now, 'cause
your pa 'et him up when he was wee.

05:37.345 --> 05:39.438
He hired me on as his ship's captain...

05:39.480 --> 05:42.643
so really it's kinda more
my boat than yours at this point.

05:42.683 --> 05:46.551
Met her last week in lbiza.
At <i>Fiesta Scientifico.</i>

05:46.587 --> 05:49.021
- It's not serious.
- That was last week?

05:49.056 --> 05:51.820
Damn Post Office
must've lost my invitation.

05:51.859 --> 05:54.225
I'm sure.
Here we are.

05:54.262 --> 05:58.164
So, let's have a look
at this famous tape of yours.

05:58.199 --> 06:00.224
It will be up to you, Rusty.

06:00.268 --> 06:04.637
Good luck, Godspeed,
and go, Team Venture!

06:04.672 --> 06:06.230
That part always chokes me up.

06:06.274 --> 06:10.040
Well I did have a pitch at the Pentagon
tomorrow, but I guess I can move it.

06:10.077 --> 06:11.635
This seems pretty important.

06:13.014 --> 06:15.983
Who invited you?! Just lend us
the damn boat for a few hours!

06:16.017 --> 06:17.746
You can't do this alone, Rust.

06:17.785 --> 06:21.312
Three more pieces
scattered around the globe?

06:21.355 --> 06:24.222
- In 16 hours?
- What are you thinking? Two teams?

06:24.258 --> 06:26.453
- Brock!
- Three. You take the X-1.

06:26.494 --> 06:28.359
The Captain and I'll take the X-2.

06:28.396 --> 06:31.456
The boys can pick up
the fourth piece in the X-X-1.

06:31.499 --> 06:34.935
- We'll rendezvous in New York.
- Hello! Who's running this show?!

06:34.969 --> 06:36.061
Everyone ready?

06:36.103 --> 06:38.196
Go, Team Venture!

06:41.475 --> 06:44.035
So much cooler than ours.

06:44.078 --> 06:46.740
We got to get uncle JJ
to make one of these for pop.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.740
<i>Space Invaders!</i>
He's got <i>Space Invaders</i> in the lounge!

06:50.785 --> 06:52.548
And he's got a lounge!

06:54.388 --> 06:56.015
Jesus Jones!

06:57.124 --> 06:58.853
Now there was a band...

06:58.893 --> 07:00.827
<i>Yippers,</i> back
in the summer of '91.

07:00.861 --> 07:04.194
We all thought they was
going to be the future of rock and roll.

07:04.232 --> 07:06.029
- They sound great.
- Were great.

07:06.067 --> 07:09.764
- They're not around anymore?
- No, sir, not so's anyone'd notice it.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.605
I'll throw up.

07:14.675 --> 07:17.872
Quest Bell One.
This is Jonas Venture Jr.

07:17.912 --> 07:19.846
Request permission to board.

07:34.629 --> 07:37.189
Come on, Rusty.
Keep it up.

07:37.231 --> 07:38.425
I can help, pop.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.160
No, Jonas! No!
I was doing fine! Let go!

07:42.203 --> 07:44.967
- I don't want your help!
- Wake up, Doc.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.598
Wake up! We're almost there.

07:46.641 --> 07:49.132
I thought I was done
with those crappy dreams.

07:49.176 --> 07:50.575
That was a weird one.

07:50.611 --> 07:53.603
- Great. You can read my mind.
- Ignore me!

07:55.216 --> 07:56.478
Yes, I can.

07:58.119 --> 08:00.952
Hello! Colonel Gentleman?

08:00.988 --> 08:02.956
- Where are you?
- Are you home?

08:03.457 --> 08:06.654
- Maybe he's not here.
- Pop said he'd radio him we were coming.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.186
Pop forgets my name half the time.
Come on. Let's look around.

08:10.231 --> 08:12.165
Maybe he left, like,
a note or something.

08:13.301 --> 08:14.598
Found him!

08:14.635 --> 08:18.537
Colonel Gentleman?
Hi. It's Hank and Dean Venture.

08:18.572 --> 08:20.767
We're here for...

08:30.618 --> 08:33.178
- Are you cops?
- Cops? Us?

08:36.157 --> 08:38.489
Are... you... cops?

08:38.525 --> 08:41.620
Let me handle this, Chairman.
No, sir. We ain't five-0.

08:44.598 --> 08:46.429
- You holding?
- No, we ain't captain.

08:46.467 --> 08:47.991
Holding?

08:48.035 --> 08:51.095
We're just looking
for an old gizmo about yay big.

08:51.138 --> 08:54.574
Few years back this fella's old man
left it with your old man.

08:54.608 --> 08:57.338
- My old man?
- Yes. Your father was...

08:58.512 --> 09:00.980
Don't you talk about my father!

09:03.751 --> 09:04.740
Don't touch him!

09:04.785 --> 09:08.050
You can't get cooties from a dead body,
Dean. That's a total myth.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.557
Not cooties, Hank.
Clueties.

09:10.591 --> 09:14.789
We need to preserve the crime scene
because I smell a mystery.

09:14.829 --> 09:18.595
Well, I smell dead guy. We don't have time
for mystery, Sherlock Homo.

09:18.632 --> 09:22.090
If we don't find that piece
of grandpa's thing, then... then...

09:22.136 --> 09:25.594
Wait. What happens if we don't
find that piece of grandpa's thing?

09:25.639 --> 09:26.663
I don't know.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.815
All right, all right.
Just put the gun down, will ya?

09:37.852 --> 09:40.946
You wouldn't want to hurt
the doctor, would ya?

09:40.988 --> 09:42.922
You're a doctor?

09:42.957 --> 09:47.189
Well, I... l'm not a medical doctor.
I just have a PhD.

09:47.228 --> 09:52.063
That's right. He's a doctor.
And he can write you a prescription for...

09:52.099 --> 09:54.329
anything you might need.

09:54.368 --> 09:56.131
Right.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.570
What seems to be
the trouble, Mr. Quest?

10:01.909 --> 10:04.070
I'm in real pain.

10:07.515 --> 10:08.948
Check this out.

10:08.983 --> 10:13.420
"Dear diary, another dreary party
at the Frost's flat...

10:13.454 --> 10:16.548
"but, oh, the bitches
were in rare form tonight."

10:16.590 --> 10:19.058
Skip ahead. Maybe later
he talks about grandpa's thing.

10:19.093 --> 10:22.358
Wait. There's some kind of a list.
Could be a clue.

10:22.396 --> 10:25.957
"Toys Colonel Gentleman
wishes he had when he was a lad."

10:26.000 --> 10:28.764
But they weren't invented yet.

10:28.803 --> 10:32.432
<i>Micronauts,</i>
<i>Scooby-Doo Monster</i> Game...

10:32.473 --> 10:36.136
<i>Which Witch,</i>
<i>AT-AT lmperial Walker.</i>

10:36.177 --> 10:38.338
<i>Stay Alive, The Survival Game.</i>

10:38.379 --> 10:39.676
What is that, code?

10:39.713 --> 10:42.773
"Colonel Gentleman's good names
for an imaginary friend."

10:42.817 --> 10:46.913
"Colonel Gentleman's Hollywood actresses
who need a smack in the mouth."

10:46.954 --> 10:49.616
They go on and on.
This is a crazy person's diary.

10:53.060 --> 10:55.995
You found it!
Good eye, Hank.

10:57.231 --> 10:59.199
Venture 2 to Venture 1!

10:59.233 --> 11:01.861
We're coming in for a landing!
Do you copy?

11:01.902 --> 11:04.700
Roger, Venture 2.
You're clear for landing.

11:04.738 --> 11:06.729
Next stop, New York.

11:06.774 --> 11:11.040
Stop your sourpussing.
We got what you needed.

11:14.415 --> 11:18.374
One lmpossible Plaza. Worldwide
headquarters of <i>lmpossible Industries...</i>

11:18.419 --> 11:22.378
and allegedly the most technologically
advanced skyscraper in the nation.

11:22.423 --> 11:23.481
Yeah, so?

11:23.524 --> 11:28.223
But what stood in this very spot
20 years ago? Anyone?

11:28.262 --> 11:32.460
It was Venture Industries
World Headquarters, thank you.

11:32.500 --> 11:36.493
Somewhere in that foundation
is the last piece of my father's little puzzle.

11:36.537 --> 11:40.029
And Professor lmpossible's
just going to let you dig up his basement.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.304
How about you stick
to the heavy lifting...

11:42.343 --> 11:45.039
and leave the heavy thinking
to the super scientist?

11:45.079 --> 11:48.071
Doc's got something
even my brother doesn't have.

11:48.115 --> 11:49.639
Someone on the inside.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.384
Going somewhere, Sally?

11:55.422 --> 11:58.482
I just have to pick
a few things up at the store, Richard.

11:58.526 --> 12:00.960
Stop that nonsense.
I'll send a man out.

12:00.995 --> 12:04.021
- Just type up a little list and...
- No, I want to go.

12:04.064 --> 12:08.865
- I need some fresh air.
- Well, all right. I'll allow it this one time.

12:08.903 --> 12:11.997
- Will you be taking the child?
- Ned's going to watch him.

12:12.039 --> 12:16.942
- I'm not really... comfortable with that.
- Why not?

12:16.977 --> 12:19.571
He's retarded, Sally.
You've seen <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

12:19.613 --> 12:23.515
You know what can happen. Please!
Can't you just leave the child with Huggy?

12:23.551 --> 12:27.510
Stop calling him the child, Richard!
His name is Rocket!

12:27.555 --> 12:30.524
And I'm not leaving him
with your crappy robot!

12:30.558 --> 12:33.026
Sally, why,
that's almost churlish.

12:33.060 --> 12:36.393
And you're visible.
What's this really about?

12:36.430 --> 12:39.263
You can't replace family
with a robot, Richard.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.098
We need real
human affection.

12:42.136 --> 12:46.095
That's why Huggy's programmed
to simulate it, sweetness.

12:47.641 --> 12:52.271
Please, Richard.
Let me go.

12:52.313 --> 12:56.113
Yes, yes.
Perhaps the fresh air will...

12:56.150 --> 12:59.608
calm the... female...

12:59.653 --> 13:02.884
Don't strain yourself, Richard.
Good-bye.

13:04.858 --> 13:06.723
Real human affection.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.127
Perhaps a pill
or a burst of Gamma radiation or...

13:10.164 --> 13:15.261
Wait a minute. Sally, wait!
Would you like some company?

13:26.246 --> 13:28.305
Hello again... Sally.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.907
Dr. Venture!

13:30.951 --> 13:34.887
When you called me, I couldn't believe it.
You never answered any of my letters.

13:34.922 --> 13:38.449
I worried you'd forgotten me and moved on
but I never gave up hope.

13:38.492 --> 13:42.929
The only thing that made my life bearable,
was the hope that someday...

13:42.963 --> 13:45.124
you'd come for me and Rocket.

13:45.165 --> 13:48.134
- Where is your boy Ruck... Rocky, was it?
- Rocket.

13:48.168 --> 13:50.966
I had his uncle Ned take him
to the park just where you said.

13:51.005 --> 13:53.530
You're sure he didn't say
anything to your husband?

13:53.574 --> 13:57.533
No, no. I promised him a great big ice
cream cone if he could keep a secret.

13:57.578 --> 13:59.876
- Ice cream!
- No, dude. Wait.

13:59.913 --> 14:02.404
We're supposed
to stay on the...

14:04.618 --> 14:06.415
Give it! Give me the ice cream!

14:11.625 --> 14:13.456
Nap time.

14:13.494 --> 14:17.658
Someone want to help me with the human
callous here? Anyone? A little help?

14:17.698 --> 14:22.158
Sally, there is something
I need you to do for me...

14:22.202 --> 14:24.636
before we go off
and live happily ever after.

14:24.672 --> 14:28.733
Dr. Venture, anything.
Just do one thing for me.

14:28.776 --> 14:34.942
Pinch me, because I must be dreaming.
I can't believe you're really here!

14:34.982 --> 14:38.315
It's OK, lady.
I see him, too!

14:38.352 --> 14:43.119
This is just... wrong,
man, even for you.

14:43.157 --> 14:45.921
- Look at her.
- I have watched you pull a man's eyes...

14:45.959 --> 14:49.224
and make him dance like a marionette
with his own optic nerves.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.289
- At least I didn't break his heart.
- You don't know that.

14:52.332 --> 14:55.233
- Access granted.
- We're in, lover.

14:55.269 --> 14:59.069
Welcome. This is <i>lmpossible.</i>

15:02.543 --> 15:05.512
Funny face, this doesn't
look like the basement.

15:05.546 --> 15:07.036
That's because it's not!

15:09.249 --> 15:10.546
Hello.

15:10.584 --> 15:13.610
Pick up everything
you needed at the store, honey?

15:13.654 --> 15:16.623
What are you doing here?
<i>You</i> were supposed to be our rescue team.

15:16.657 --> 15:20.115
What do you want from me? You had
super kill guy and you still got caught.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.620
You see, Dr. Venture, I found the piece
your father hid in the foundation years ago.

15:24.665 --> 15:27.065
Then I thought about you
in physics class.

15:27.101 --> 15:33.062
You were a daydreamer, a sass mouth,
and not infrequently, a bit of a giggle puss.

15:33.107 --> 15:35.940
Somehow I doubt 20 years
of amphetamines and failure...

15:35.976 --> 15:39.571
have done anything to improve that.
And you see, this invention...

15:39.613 --> 15:42.741
is simply too important
to trust to someone like yourself.

15:42.783 --> 15:45.684
Richard?
Where's Rocket?

15:45.719 --> 15:48.313
- Whom?
- Rocket! Your son.

15:49.389 --> 15:52.620
- I can't believe you!
- H.E.L.P. ER. Come in. H.E.L.P. ER.

15:52.659 --> 15:55.321
Now he's bossing my robot around!
You see this?

15:55.362 --> 15:58.593
- You have a radio in your collar?
- Of course! What kind of an idiot...

15:58.632 --> 16:01.999
would strap his only means
of emergency communication to his wrist?

16:02.035 --> 16:05.402
- They always tie you up.
- Well, fancy schmancy!

16:05.439 --> 16:07.304
H.E.L.P. ER, we need you to access...

16:07.341 --> 16:10.071
the lmpossible security system
and get us free.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.240
Hello! Anyone?

16:17.584 --> 16:21.042
OK, the Grand Galactic Inquisitor
is coming out!

16:21.088 --> 16:24.649
But you are to continue
to ignore me!

16:24.691 --> 16:26.852
OK?

16:26.894 --> 16:29.795
All right!
I'm taking that as a yes!

16:33.200 --> 16:34.861
Hello?

16:37.337 --> 16:39.737
Someone left a baby!

16:42.910 --> 16:44.468
Ignore me!

16:46.113 --> 16:48.138
Halt! Identify yourself.

16:48.182 --> 16:51.515
How do you even know he's mine?!
The way you alley cat around...

16:51.552 --> 16:54.544
with every washed-up scientist
who blows through town.

16:54.588 --> 16:56.647
Three.

16:56.690 --> 16:58.453
Two.

16:58.492 --> 17:00.050
One.

17:00.093 --> 17:01.151
Engage.

17:03.096 --> 17:06.623
He's out there somewhere!
You have to do something!

17:06.666 --> 17:11.036
- Stop working on that and do something!
- Sally, please! This is important.

17:11.070 --> 17:14.801
What could be more important
than your family, Richard?!

17:17.578 --> 17:19.045
Science?

17:19.079 --> 17:21.877
Of all the intolerable bug-a-boos!

17:21.915 --> 17:24.542
Gentlemen, this is a family discussion.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.389
You have no idea
who you're dealing with, do you?!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.824
I am Professor
Richard lmpossible!

17:32.860 --> 17:34.691
I can do this...

17:35.529 --> 17:37.019
No, no, no!

17:38.198 --> 17:39.665
Holy crap!

17:52.312 --> 17:53.438
Man overboard!

18:03.991 --> 18:05.549
Go! Go! Go!

18:12.499 --> 18:13.727
Wait. Limited seating.

18:33.287 --> 18:35.778
Good news, sample subjects of earth!

18:35.822 --> 18:38.950
The glorious moment
of judgment is upon you!

18:38.992 --> 18:42.723
- Hey, it's 8.20 on the meter, Stretch!
- Ignore me!

18:42.763 --> 18:46.460
- Who the hell is that?
- Long story. Just ignore him.

18:53.573 --> 18:54.562
Papa?

19:05.385 --> 19:07.910
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

19:07.955 --> 19:10.219
- Where you can't follow, Rusty.
- Don't go.

19:10.257 --> 19:13.590
There's so much I want to ask you,
so many unanswered questions.

19:13.627 --> 19:16.289
Like, what's that big
yellow thing in pop's lab do?

19:16.330 --> 19:19.163
And if you drop a penny
from the Empire State Building...

19:19.199 --> 19:20.826
does it go through your body or...

19:20.867 --> 19:23.335
Quiet. I'm trying to have
a family moment here.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.600
Where have you been
for the past 20 years?!

19:25.639 --> 19:30.872
Why haven't you contacted me?
How can you just leave me all alone?

19:30.911 --> 19:35.678
Rusty. You were never alone.
Those stars...

19:35.716 --> 19:39.174
Well, OK, you can't see them right now
because we're in the city...

19:39.219 --> 19:43.246
but those stars,
they're always watching us.

19:43.290 --> 19:46.726
- Wait! Stay with us!
- Yes, please, stay.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.161
I'm your other son.
We've never met.

19:50.197 --> 19:54.031
All right. Look,
I'm not really your father, OK?

19:54.067 --> 19:56.934
I'm an alien sent here
at this appointed time to kill that guy...

19:56.970 --> 19:59.461
because he would have destroyed
all life as you know it.

19:59.506 --> 20:01.667
- What?!
- I took the form of your dad...

20:01.708 --> 20:04.302
because I figured
it would be easier to accept.

20:04.344 --> 20:08.713
I didn't want to stress you out.
End of the world, life on other planets...

20:08.749 --> 20:14.244
Why... you... son of a bitch! Do you know
what you just put me through?!

20:14.287 --> 20:17.984
What the... were you thinking?
What kind of... up planet are you from...

20:18.025 --> 20:20.585
where you think
showing up as my dead... father...

20:20.627 --> 20:22.652
is supposed
to make me feel any better?!

20:22.696 --> 20:24.630
- OK, take it easy.
- You prick!

20:24.664 --> 20:26.825
Look, I just saved
your entire planet.

20:26.867 --> 20:29.893
- Prick!
- All right. Fine. You wanna see? Here!

20:32.773 --> 20:36.368
There! That would've been better?
If I'd shown up like that out of nowhere?!

20:36.410 --> 20:38.810
Look at you!
You practically crapped your pants.

20:38.845 --> 20:41.040
Except him. He crapped his pants!

20:41.081 --> 20:44.573
We know what we're doing up there, OK?
So don't second guess me.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.781
Just get in your little plane,
go back to your little lives...

20:47.821 --> 20:50.790
and thank your lucky stars
someone in this universe...

20:50.824 --> 20:54.123
is looking out for you!
Ungrateful little half-monkeys!

20:55.529 --> 20:57.394
- Bye.
- Whatever.

20:58.832 --> 21:02.393
Great. So we haul ass all over the world,
almost got ourselves killed...

21:02.436 --> 21:04.028
and now, nothing to show for it.

21:04.071 --> 21:08.405
- Not even gas money.
- We did kinda, like, save the world.

21:08.442 --> 21:11.309
- I guess.
- And that big guy finally shut up.

21:11.344 --> 21:14.142
And we worked together,
like a family.

21:14.181 --> 21:15.978
Go, Team Venture!

21:44.678 --> 21:47.704
Life among the stars.

21:47.747 --> 21:50.477
Pretty amazing stuff, eh, Captain?

21:50.517 --> 21:51.711
<i>Yippers,</i> boss.

21:51.751 --> 21:55.551
I'm sorry. Rocket, no.
He likes you.

21:55.589 --> 21:58.581
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sally lmpossible!

21:58.625 --> 22:01.150
- Have we met before?
- Not that <i>you</i> know of.

22:01.194 --> 22:04.630
I'm Jonas.
Jonas Venture Jr.

22:04.664 --> 22:07.497
You can call me JJ...
If you like.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.967
I like.

22:10.137 --> 22:13.504
You can almost hear
the old humpbacks a'callin'.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.598
Yep.

22:14.641 --> 22:16.074
We better get moving, Brock.

22:16.109 --> 22:18.805
You know how clingy
old skull face over there can get.

22:18.845 --> 22:22.645
- And I likes my independence.
- It's pretty f'd up, man.

22:22.682 --> 22:26.516
Don't tell me you were sucked in
by all that "You're not alone" crap, too?

22:26.553 --> 22:31.547
I've seen some weird
stuff in my life, but this...

22:31.591 --> 22:32.990
Yeah.

22:33.927 --> 22:35.690
Should we help him?

22:35.729 --> 22:38.664
That is bloody good soup!
