WEBVTT

00:02.130 --> 00:03.768
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:03.800 --> 00:06.098
I'VE BEEN TRACKING DOWN
MY MISSING RV.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.495
TOBY GAVE IT TO "A,"
BUT SPENCER ALREADY KNEW THAT.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.600
I'M SORRY. TOBY JUST ISN'T
READY TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON YET.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.733
I FOUND THIS.
RED COAT IS "A," RIGHT?

00:13.780 --> 00:15.668
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BLOND.
IT'S NOT THIS.

00:15.710 --> 00:19.248
E. LAMB? EDDIE LAMB?
THAT'S ME.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.249
I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.043
HOW MANY POINTS
FOR THE WORD "SLUT"?

00:25.090 --> 00:27.217
STOP! THAT'S MY CAR!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:27.260 --> 00:30.559
I KINDA WISH I HAD DONE IT.
IF ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO
YOU AGAIN, I WANNA BE READY.

00:30.590 --> 00:33.388
IT'S THE GUN.
AT LEAST I THINK IT IS.
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT?

00:33.430 --> 00:35.751
BECAUSE I FOUND IT
IN MY MOM'S CLOSET.
I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.791
HOLD IT! DON'T MOVE!

00:37.830 --> 00:40.094
THAT GUN WAS USED TO KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN,

00:40.140 --> 00:42.108
AND YOUR MOTHER'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ON THE BULLETS.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.835
I'VE GOT A KEY TO SIGN IN.

00:43.870 --> 00:46.407
COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO,
'CAUSE WE'RE BREAKING IN
TO WILDEN'S APARTMENT.

00:46.440 --> 00:51.400
LOOK FOR LETTERS, PICTURES,
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CONNECT
WILDEN TO SHANA AND JENNA.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.817
IF SHE DOESN'T FIND THAT KEY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:54.850 --> 00:57.239
WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR ME
NOT TO BE WORKING. ( gasps )

01:04.590 --> 01:10.620
COULD YOU JUST PUT
BOB LARABEE ON THE PHONE?
HE TOOK THE INITIAL REPORT.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.131
( sighs ) THANKS. I'LL WAIT.

01:15.170 --> 01:18.833
BOB? NO, NO, NO, WE'RE --
WE'RE IN THE MOTEL.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.577
I HAVE TO MEET
THE INSURANCE ADJUSTOR
OVER THERE ABOUT 2:00,

01:21.610 --> 01:24.147
BUT LOOK, BEFORE WE DO --

01:24.180 --> 01:30.187
( sighs ) YES, I UNDERSTAND
IT WAS A STOLEN CAR,
BUT NO SIGN OF THE DRIVER?

01:30.220 --> 01:34.350
I MEAN, IF HE WAS
STRUNG-OUT ENOUGH TO DRIVE
STRAIGHT INTO MY LIVING ROOM,

01:34.390 --> 01:35.880
THEN HOW DID HE
GET AWAY SO FAST?

01:35.920 --> 01:39.219
THANK YOU.
( sighs )

01:39.260 --> 01:42.764
NO, NO. ( sighs )

01:42.800 --> 01:46.236
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE DOING
EVERYTHING YOU CAN,

01:46.270 --> 01:49.433
BUT THIS CAR
CRASHED INTO MY HOUSE.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.871
MY DAUGHTER COULD'VE BEEN
SI'I'I'ING IN THAT ROOM.

01:55.910 --> 02:00.609
LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA
CALL YOU BACK AFTER I MEET
WITH THE ADJUSTOR, OKAY?

02:00.650 --> 02:02.140
ALL RIGHT, THANKS. BYE.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.282
( phone beeping )

02:03.320 --> 02:04.480
( sighs )

02:04.520 --> 02:07.683
HOW DOES SOMEONE JUST RUN AWAY
FROM AN ACCIDENT LIKE THAT

02:07.720 --> 02:10.223
WITHOUT ONE NEIGHBOR
SEEING HIM?

02:16.400 --> 02:17.890
YOU BE'I'I'ER BRING A JACKET.

02:17.930 --> 02:21.229
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO GET COLD TONIGHT.

02:21.270 --> 02:24.364
I'LL COME
STRAIGHT HOME AFI'ER SCHOOL
TO HELP YOU UNPACK.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.675
DON'T YOU HAVE A COLLEGE
GUIDANCE SESSION TODAY?

02:27.710 --> 02:30.543
YEAH, IT WAS SCHEDULED
FOR THIS MORNING,
BUT I FIGURED --

02:30.580 --> 02:31.899
HONEY, DON'T MISS THAT, PLEASE.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.747
MOM, I WANNA HELP YOU OUT.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.385
YOU CAN HELP ME
BY THINKING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

02:38.590 --> 02:41.388
Aria: HOW ARE THEY?

02:41.420 --> 02:43.251
SHE SAID THEY'RE FINE.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.359
( sighs )

02:44.390 --> 02:46.790
"A" REALLY LIKES
THROWING CARS AT PEOPLE.

02:46.830 --> 02:50.493
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
THIS REALLY WAS AN ACCIDENT?

02:51.570 --> 02:53.538
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

02:53.570 --> 02:55.492
NO, OKAY, "A" DID THIS,
BUT WHY?

02:55.540 --> 02:58.759
TO KEEP US OFF BALANCE,
KEEP US FROM FINDING RED COAT,

02:58.810 --> 03:00.675
OR CECE DRAKE,
OR WHOEVER WE'RE DEALING WITH.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.439
WELL, I THINK
IT REALLY WAS CECE,

03:02.480 --> 03:04.277
AND I HOPE THAT TOBY
AND CALEB FIND HER.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.971
GOD, SPENCE, WHAT IS
TAKING YOUR MOM SO LONG?

03:06.010 --> 03:08.615
COURTS RUN ON JUDGE-TIME,
NOT LAWYER-TIME.

03:08.650 --> 03:11.483
WELL, IT'S AN ARRAIGNMENT.
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS
SET BAIL AND SHE CAN GO.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.489
SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD
CALL YOU THE MINUTE THAT
YOUR MOM WAS RELEASED.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.852
JUST TAKE A BREATH, ALL RIGHT?

03:16.890 --> 03:19.654
( door 0
pen
MOM? S)

03:19.700 --> 03:22.362
HI. HAVE YOU GIRLS
HAD BREAKFAST?

03:22.400 --> 03:25.369
MRS. HASTINGS,
WHERE'S MY MOM?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.334
SPENCER, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
ARIA UPSTAIRS FOR A MINUTE?

03:27.370 --> 03:28.337
NO.

03:28.370 --> 03:30.838
NO, I WANT THEM HERE.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.304
HANNA, WE ENTERED
A PLEA OF NOT GUILTY,

03:33.340 --> 03:35.399
BUT THE JUDGE REFUSED
TO GRANT BAIL.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.702
NO.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.569
WHY?

03:37.610 --> 03:39.919
FIRST DEGREE MURDER
OF A POLICE OFFICER,

03:39.950 --> 03:43.511
A DISTRICT ATTORNEY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE
ANY MORE MISTAKES.

03:43.550 --> 03:45.848
BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY
GOING TO APPEAL.

03:45.890 --> 03:48.313
OKAY, AND HOW LONG
IS THAT GONNA TAKE?

03:48.360 --> 03:51.727
THE PAPERS WILL BE
ON THE JUDGE'S DESK
THIS AFTERNOON.

03:51.760 --> 03:54.490
BUT SOME THINGS
HAVE BEEN PUT IN MOTION.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.929
WHAT SORT OF THINGS?

03:55.960 --> 03:57.518
HANNA, YOUR MOTHER
IS GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED

03:57.570 --> 03:59.834
TO ANOTHER LOCATION.
WHAT LOCATION?

03:59.870 --> 04:04.000
SHE'S BEING REMANDED
TO THE STATE PRISON IN MUNCY
UNTIL THE TRIAL.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.598
THEY'LL MOVE HER TOMORROW.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.335
GOD, YOU PROMISED.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.779
HONEY, I'M SORRY.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.751
( sighs )

04:25.760 --> 04:27.751
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:27.800 --> 04:29.791
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

04:29.830 --> 04:32.367
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

04:32.400 --> 04:35.631
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

04:35.670 --> 04:40.869
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:40.910 --> 04:43.049
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

04:43.080 --> 04:45.674
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:54.820 --> 04:57.789
I SHOULD BE THE ONE IN JAIL,
NOT MY MOM.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.798
HANNA, YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.593
YEAH,
SOMEBODY KILLED WILDEN

05:01.630 --> 05:03.461
AND "A" IS TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.728
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.796
MY MOM WENT OUT THERE
TO PROTECT ME,
HOW IS THIS NOT MY FAULT?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.728
( phone rings )

05:09.770 --> 05:12.432
( sighs ) IT'S CALEB.
I CAN'T TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.699
HANNA, MY MOM
IS A REALLY GREAT LAWYER.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.071
WELL, THEN WHY
ISN'T MY MOM OUT?

05:17.110 --> 05:18.941
BECAUSE IT'S
JUST ONE HEARING.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.813
SHE'LL WIN THE CASE.
SHE ALWAYS DOES.

05:21.850 --> 05:23.545
ALWAYS?

05:25.120 --> 05:29.113
OKAY, SO DO YOU WANNA GO
TO SCHOOL? OR NOT GO?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.755
NO YOU GUYS GO. I'LL BE OKAY.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.688
ARE YOU SURE?

05:34.730 --> 05:36.823
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEE MY DAD.

05:36.870 --> 05:42.831
IF MY MOM DOESN'T COME BACK,
THEN I HAVE TO MOVE IN WITH HIM
AND THE GRUESOME TWOSOME.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.804
( sighs )

05:44.840 --> 05:48.139
YOU GUYS GO.
I'LL BE FINE.

05:48.180 --> 05:49.909
OKAY.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.145
SPENCE, TELL YOUR MOM I'M SORRY
IF I YELLED AT HER.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.148
SHE'S AN ATTORNEY, OKAY?
SHE'S USED TO IT.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.613
A REALLY GOOD ONE.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.427
OKAY, WELL, CALL US
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

06:04.460 --> 06:06.621
YEAH. I'LL BE GOOD.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.590
( indistinct chatter )

06:15.640 --> 06:17.562
HEY, ARIA.

06:17.610 --> 06:19.578
SORRY.
NO, I'M SORRY.

06:19.610 --> 06:22.579
HEY, SO I'M GONNA BE
OUT LATE TONIGHT
WITH THE TEAM.

06:22.610 --> 06:25.704
I'M CHECKING IN WITH YOU
IN CASE DAD CALLS
FROM SYRACUSE.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.945
BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY
I HAVE A CURFEW.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.584
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE TEAM?

06:29.620 --> 06:31.508
WE'RE CELEBRATING
AFTER THE GAME.

06:31.550 --> 06:35.008
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GONNA BE CELEBRATING?

06:35.060 --> 06:37.153
WELL, IF WE WIN,
IT'S A CELEBRATION.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.782
IF WE LOSE,
IT'S A PARTY.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.195
SO, WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK --
JUST DON'T WAIT UP.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.892
MIKE, WHAT TIME ARE YOU --
IT'S IMPORTANT.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.728
I NEED TO SPEND TIME
WITH THESE GUYS.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.590
WHY?

06:49.770 --> 06:54.002
IT'S DIFFERENT...
SINCE THE THING
WITH CONNOR'S CAR.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.735
WELL, WHAT'S THAT HAVE TO DO --

06:55.780 --> 06:58.442
I'M HANDLING IT.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.415
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT BAG?

07:04.690 --> 07:07.113
I'M TAKING A CLASS THERE.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.652
IN MARTIAL ARTS? WHY?

07:10.690 --> 07:14.751
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH LEARNING HOW
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.033
SO IS IT AN ELEPHANT?

07:24.070 --> 07:25.958
A DINOSAUR?

07:26.010 --> 07:28.979
OH, COME ON, MALCOLM,
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME A HINT.

07:29.010 --> 07:31.706
( chuckles ) OH, OKAY,
IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE ME?

07:31.750 --> 07:32.819
OH.

07:32.850 --> 07:35.819
UH, WELL, HEY,
LISTEN, REMBRANDT.

07:35.850 --> 07:39.809
WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.
I'M WITH A STUDENT NOW.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.829
BUT -- OH, OKAY. LOVE YOU. BYE.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.954
HEY, COME IN.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.958
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.228
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.228
BUT MY MOM WANTS ME
TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE,

07:51.270 --> 07:53.158
WITH OR WITHOUT A HOUSE.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.762
OH, MY GOD, EMILY,
I'M SO SORRY.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.938
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT
THE TWO OF YOU MUST BE...

08:00.980 --> 08:02.709
FEELING.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.605
DO THE POLICE HAVE ANY IDEA?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.117
THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.777
THEY KNOW IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.038
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS NOW.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.217
WITH THE ACCIDENT
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON WITH HANNA'S MOM --

08:13.260 --> 08:17.128
IF I DON'T, THEN I'LL
START MISSING DEADLINES.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.855
JUST START THINKING THAT
THINGS ARE GONNA GET BETTER,
RIGHT?

08:18.890 --> 08:20.653
RIGHT.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.859
EMILY, WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE,
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

08:27.900 --> 08:31.609
WERE DODGING SOME
PRETTY SERIOUS THREATS.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.303
AND I KNOW THAT MONA
CONFESSED TO A LOT OF THAT,

08:35.340 --> 08:39.071
BUT IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE
WHO STILL WANTS TO HURT YOU?

08:39.110 --> 08:43.046
IS HISTORY
REPEATING ITSELF?

08:45.920 --> 08:48.889
YOU GUYS TOOK A LONG TIME
TO SPEAK UP,

08:48.920 --> 08:50.956
AND IF THIS
IS HAPPENING AGAIN --

08:50.990 --> 08:52.389
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:52.430 --> 08:56.127
SOME SPEED FREAK LOST CONTROL
AND USED MY FRONT PORCH
AS A BUMPER.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.798
WHERE IS THIS COLLEGE?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.838
MARYLAND.

09:00.870 --> 09:02.906
SHE ISN'T ANSWERING MY CALLS.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.908
SHE'S REALLY RAGGED RIGHT NOW.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.909
SHE THOUGHT HER MOM
WAS GONNA GET BAIL.
WE ALL DID.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.170
I JUST DON'T LIKE HER
BEING ALONE, YOU KNOW?

09:10.210 --> 09:12.770
WELL, SHE SAID THAT
SHE'S GONNA CALL HER DAD.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.311
COME ON.
THAT'S NOT ANY BETTER THAN
BEING ALONE, IF YOU ASK ME.

09:15.350 --> 09:16.612
LOOK, I'M GONNA
CUT AFTER ENGLISH

09:16.650 --> 09:19.084
AND MAKE SURE SHE'S NOT AT HOME
STILL HIDING UNDER MY SHEETS.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.087
OKAY?

09:20.120 --> 09:21.348
HOW ARE THE REST OF YOU DOING?

09:21.390 --> 09:22.948
WE'RE JUST DANDY.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.127
SPENCER...

09:24.160 --> 09:26.993
I DROVE BY EMILY'S, OKAY?

09:27.030 --> 09:29.794
THEY'RE STILL
PULLING PIECES OF THAT CAR
OUT OF THE LIVING ROOM.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.867
SO, I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN:
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:32.900 --> 09:35.596
WE'RE TRYING TO STAY POSITIVE.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.132
IF "A" IS ESCALATING THINGS,
MAYBE IT MEANS THAT WE'RE
GETTING TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT.

09:39.170 --> 09:42.207
MAYBE YOU AND TOBY ARE GETTING
TOO CLOSE TO WILDEN'S KILLER.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.845
ANYWAY, THAT NUMBER THAT YOU
PULLED FROM NIGEL'S CELL PHONE,

09:44.880 --> 09:47.144
DID YOU EVER FIGURE OUT
WHO WAS ON THE OTHER END?

09:47.180 --> 09:48.875
SOMEBODY REALLY SMART.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.616
THE NUMBER IS ASSIGNED
TO THREE PEOPLE
AND THREE ADDRESSES.

09:51.650 --> 09:52.856
ALL IN NEW YORK.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.380
WELL, WHICH ONE IS REAL?

09:54.420 --> 09:56.217
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WHY TOBY
WENT TO NEW YORK --

09:56.260 --> 09:58.285
TO KNOCK ON SOME DOORS,
SEE WHO ANSWERS.

09:58.330 --> 10:00.150
MAYBE CECE DRAKE.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.394
MAYBE.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.125
( bell rings )

10:03.170 --> 10:05.297
OKAY, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST HAVE HANNA CALL ME?

10:05.330 --> 10:06.297
I WILL.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.139
THANK YOU.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.366
THIS COLLEGE IS TINY.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.708
IS IT WORTH EVEN FILLING OUT
AN APPLICATION?

10:14.740 --> 10:15.832
WHY NOT?

10:15.880 --> 10:17.370
WELL, IF THERE'S
HARDLY ANY SLOTS --

10:17.410 --> 10:19.719
WELL, LET'S NOT WRITE
OUR OWN REJECT ION LETTER
QUITE YET.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.877
YOU PROBABLY HAVE
A BETTER SHOT THAN MOST PEOPLE.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.410
MR. FITZ,
I DON'T SWIM ANYMORE.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.839
NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR WORK OUTSIDE OF THE POOL.

10:25.890 --> 10:28.859
THESE LITTLE COLLEGES
ARE LOOKING TO BUILD
COMMUNITIES.

10:28.890 --> 10:32.690
AND THEY'D PROBABLY BE
PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK
YOU DID LAST SUMMER IN HAITI.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.095
THAT WAS FOR,
LIKE, THREE WEEKS.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.189
YEAH, THREE WEEKS
YOU SPENT VOLUNTEERING,

10:36.230 --> 10:38.323
THINKING ABOUT OTHERS
AND NOT YOURSELF.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.396
THAT'S... PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.864
I DON'T FEEL VERY IMPRESSIVE.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.944
ARE YOU STILL IN TOUCH WITH
ANY OF YOUR OLD SUPERVISORS?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.141
I ONLY HAD ONE. ZOE.

10:52.180 --> 10:53.408
CALL HER.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.839
ASK HER TO WRITE YOU
A REFERENCE.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.348
( bell rings )

11:04.890 --> 11:08.929
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA REMIND YOU
WHO YOU REALLY ARE, EMILY.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.071
HELLO?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.805
HELLO.
YOU HAVE A COLLECT CALL

11:21.840 --> 11:23.808
FROM AN INMATE
IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.806
Ashley: ASHLEY MARIN.

11:25.850 --> 11:29.809
IF YOU WISH TO ACCEPT
AND PAY FOR THE CALL,
PLEASE PRESS THREE NOW.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.818
( phone beeps )

11:31.850 --> 11:33.078
Ashley: HANNA.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.350
MOM. ARE YOU OKAY?

11:35.390 --> 11:37.085
SO FAR.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.826
VERONICA TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE BAIL

11:39.860 --> 11:41.953
AND HOW THEY'RE GONNA MOVE ME?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.798
YEAH. YEAH, SHE TOLD ME.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.060
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS, SWEETHEART.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.159
WE ARE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.168
I MISS YOU.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.098
Ashley: I MISS YOU.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.802
WE ARE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.808
GOD, IT'S NOT FAIR.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.772
THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU AWAY
LIKE THIS.

11:59.820 --> 12:05.178
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT FAIR,
BUT THINGS CAN CHANGE.

12:05.220 --> 12:09.452
YEAH. YEAH, THEY CAN.

12:12.530 --> 12:17.490
VERONICA'S GONNA BRING YOU HERE
TOMORROW SO WE CAN SAY...

12:17.530 --> 12:20.135
SO I CAN SEE YOU, OKAY?

12:20.170 --> 12:23.401
OKAY.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.806
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.138
I LOVE YOU.

12:28.180 --> 12:31.149
Ashley: I SHOULD LET YOU GO.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.876
OKAY.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.512
BYE.

12:35.550 --> 12:36.744
( phone beeps )

12:49.560 --> 12:51.767
THANKS FOR COMING.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.405
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:03.450 --> 13:07.170
I'M GONNA CONFESS
TO KILLING DETECTIVE WILDEN.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.287
WHATEVER THEY DO TO ME
WON'T BE AS BAD AS WHAT
THEY'D DO TO HER.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.820
THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.124
YOU'RE TAKING
AN AWFUL BIG CHANCE.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.060
I CAN'T LET MY MOM
GO TO PRISON.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.068
I MEAN TALKING TO ME.

13:26.100 --> 13:29.160
SUPPOSE I'M THE ONE WHO
ACTUALLY SET UP YOUR MOTHER.

13:31.340 --> 13:35.379
WERE YOU SERIOUS WHEN YOU SAID
YOU NEVER WANTED THIS "A"
TO HURT MY MOM?

13:35.410 --> 13:38.106
YES, I WAS.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.471
WELL, THEN YOU HAVE
TO HELP ME DO THIS.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.918
WHY ME?

13:44.950 --> 13:49.080
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE BIGGEST LIE I'VE EVER TOLD.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.486
I NEED YOU
TO MAKE IT SOUND PERFECT.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.351
ME, SPENCER, THE OTHERS,
WE ALL TELL LIES,

13:54.400 --> 13:59.827
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW
TO LIVE IN A LIE.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.931
HAN NA?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.940
WHO ARE YOU?

14:11.980 --> 14:13.277
I'M BECKETT.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.515
SAM OR SAINT THOMAS?

14:15.550 --> 14:18.212
BECKETT FRYE.
YOU MUST BE SPENCER, RIGHT?

14:18.250 --> 14:19.956
YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:19.990 --> 14:21.355
I'M INTERNING WITH YOUR MOTHER.

14:21.390 --> 14:24.029
GOLDBERG PENN LAW SCHOOL
ALUMNI FELLOW.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.278
RIGHT, THAT'S WHY
YOU'D BE AT HER OFFICE,

14:26.330 --> 14:27.991
WHY ARE YOU IN OUR KITCHEN?

14:28.030 --> 14:29.429
BLAME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.166
DISCOVERY IN THE MARIN CASE.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.236
THEY SEND YOU EVERYTHING
AND MAKE YOU WADE THROUGH IT.

14:33.270 --> 14:36.967
D.A. GOT CUTE AND SENT
TO YOUR MOTHER'S HOME ADDRESS
INSTEAD OF HER OFFICE.

14:37.010 --> 14:40.969
SOMEBODY'S IN A JAIL CELL.
THEY MAKE IT LIKE IT'S A GAME.

14:41.010 --> 14:45.174
IT IS A GAME. THAT'S WHY
THEY USE THE WORDS
"WINNING" AND "LOSING."

14:45.210 --> 14:47.314
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
A GREAT LAWYER.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.578
THAN KS.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.178
DO YOU HAVE
MANY MORE OF THESE?

14:50.220 --> 14:51.642
PLENTY.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.282
LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.053
Mona: WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HERE?

15:01.100 --> 15:04.467
I'M THE ONE WHO KILLED
DETECTIVE WILDEN. I DID IT.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.560
GO HOME, LITTLE GIRL.
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR MOTHER.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.693
NO, SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO TAKE THE BLAME. I DID IT.

15:09.740 --> 15:12.163
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP REPEATING,
"I DID IT."

15:12.210 --> 15:15.077
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
HOW YOU DID IT
AND WHY YOU DID IT.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.600
OKAY, I KNOW THAT.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.700
EVERYTHING THAT SEEMS
TO POINT TO YOUR MOM,
MAKE IT POINT TO YOU, OKAY?

15:19.750 --> 15:23.311
MOTIVE. WHAT'S YOUR MOTIVE?

15:23.350 --> 15:28.185
HE WAS THREATENING ME
BECAUSE I TOLD PEOPLE HE GOT
ALISON DILAURENTIS PREGNANT.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.984
I THINK HE
MIGHT HAVE KILLED HER.

15:32.190 --> 15:35.193
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.634
I THINK THEY SENT US WILDEN'S
GRAMMAR SCHOOL REPORT CARDS.

15:41.670 --> 15:44.138
NO, I CHECKED THE BOX NUMBERS
BEFORE I SIGNED FOR THEM.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.606
NO, YOUR DAUGHTER'S HERE.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.572
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE NOT AT SCHOOL.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.271
I'M CHECKING ON HANNA.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.288
YOU HEAR THAT?

15:58.320 --> 16:00.049
NO, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE HERE.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.289
NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.719
YEAH, YEAH, TAKE YOUR TIME.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.627
I'M GONNA BE FINE.
I PROMISE YOU.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.626
( indistinct chatter )

16:12.670 --> 16:14.638
Aria: HEY, JAKE.

16:14.670 --> 16:18.629
HI. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M NOT TAKING YOU
AWAY FROM A CLASS, AM I?

16:18.670 --> 16:19.898
I'M GOOD.

16:19.940 --> 16:23.740
SO I THINK THAT
MY LITTLE BROTHER
IS TAKING A CLASS FROM YOU.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.614
MIKE --
MONTGOMERY. YEAH, GREAT KID.

16:27.650 --> 16:30.187
YEAH, I'M ACTUALLY
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

16:30.220 --> 16:31.642
UM...

16:31.690 --> 16:34.113
HAS HE SAID SOMETHING TO YOU?

16:34.160 --> 16:37.379
SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE
LIKE ME SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.126
I KNOW THAT
I SHOULDN'T EVEN ASK THAT.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.754
SINCE YOU ARE,
IT MUST BE IMPORTANT.

16:42.800 --> 16:46.065
YEAH, THANK YOU.
HE DID SAY SOMETHING ODD.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.466
WHAT?

16:48.500 --> 16:52.368
HE SAID, "IT'S HARD TO FOCUS ON
THE GAME WHEN YOUR OWN TEAMMATES
ARE PLAYING AGAINST YOU."

16:52.410 --> 16:54.378
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:54.410 --> 16:57.641
I'M GUESSING
SOME OF HIS TEAMMATES
THINK HE'S AN EASY TARGET.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.774
WHAT IS IT WITH YOUR FAMILY?
FIRST YOU, NOW YOUR BROTHER.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.708
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM THAT
I SAID THAT I WAS SCARED,
DID YOU?

17:02.750 --> 17:03.717
NO, I DIDN'T, BUT --

17:03.750 --> 17:05.286
I DON'T WANT YOU TO.
IT'S --

17:05.320 --> 17:06.446
I WON'T.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.708
OKAY.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.456
IT'S IMPORTANT.
HE DOESN'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.321
ARIA, I KNOW WE HAD
THE CONVERSATION

17:13.360 --> 17:16.557
ABOUT YOU NOT BEING...
AVAILABLE.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.058
BUT IF YOU'RE SCARED
AND YOU NEED HELP,

17:20.100 --> 17:22.068
I'M HERE FOR YOU...

17:22.100 --> 17:24.830
WITHOUT ANY COMPLICATIONS.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.462
OKAY?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.111
( indistinct chatter )

17:46.690 --> 17:49.523
( indistinct )

18:03.710 --> 18:06.770
HELLO.
HELLO.

18:06.810 --> 18:10.246
I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME I THANKED
EVERYBODY WHO LOOKED AFTER ME.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.281
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.481
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

18:26.130 --> 18:27.438
THE NIGHT TOBY'S MOTHER DIED,
YOU WERE QUESTIONED
BY THE POLICE.

18:28.470 --> 18:31.462
BY DETECTIVE WILDEN,
ONLY HE WAS OFFICER WILDEN THEN.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.172
I WASN'T QUESTIONED,
I WAS INTERVIEWED.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.234
COME ON, EDDIE.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.340
THEY TALKED TO EVERYONE
WHO WAS WORKING THAT NIGHT.

18:38.380 --> 18:41.213
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

18:41.250 --> 18:42.649
YOU'VE READ IT.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.839
"SUBJECT REPORTED
PATIENT CAVANAUGH

18:46.890 --> 18:48.858
"WAS NOT IN HER ROOM
AT BED CHECK.

18:48.890 --> 18:51.324
"HE DISCOVERED
THE ROOF ACCESS DOOR UNLOCKED.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.590
"HE WENT UP TO THE ROOF
AND LOOKED OVER THE EAST LEDGE

18:53.630 --> 18:55.222
AND SAW A BODY
ON THE GROUND BELOW."

18:55.260 --> 18:56.488
THAT'S WHAT WILDEN
WROTE IN HIS NOTES.

18:56.530 --> 18:57.622
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.819
THEN WHY IN
THE OFFICIAL REPORT

18:58.870 --> 19:02.533
DOES IT SAY THAT
SHE JUMPED FROM A WINDOW
AND NOT THE ROOF?

19:02.570 --> 19:05.437
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE,
THE WOMAN'S DEAD.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.835
IF IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE,

19:06.870 --> 19:09.407
THEN WHY WOULD WILDEN
CHANGE THE FACTS
WHEN HE FILED THE REPORT?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.670
WHY WOULD HE LIE?
WHY DOES ANYBODY LIE?

19:11.710 --> 19:14.838
YOU THINK
SOMEBODY PAID HIM OFF

19:14.880 --> 19:16.848
TO LIE ABOUT
HOW TOBY'S MOM DIED?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.314
DIDN'T YOU EVER WONDER
HOW A GUY LIKE WILDEN

19:19.350 --> 19:22.456
GOES FROM BEING PATROLMAN
TO DETECTIVE SO FAST?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.720
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY
WHEN THEY FILED THE REPORT.

19:24.760 --> 19:28.651
TELL WHO? THE POLICE?
WILDEN WAS THE POLICE.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.521
WELL, TOBY DESERVES
SOME ANSWERS... AND SO DO I.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.266
SPENCER, IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD PUT THIS BACK

19:34.300 --> 19:36.791
WHERE I FOUND IT
AND FORGET THAT I EVER SAW IT.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.808
IT'S NOT GOING
TO CHANGE ANYTHING,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.832
NOT FOR YOU, NOT FOR ME,
AND NOT FOR TOBY'S MOTHER.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.304
YEAH, WELL,
MY FRIEND HANNA'S MOTHER

19:45.350 --> 19:48.239
IS SITTING IN JAIL
ACCUSED OF KILLING WILDEN,

19:48.280 --> 19:52.341
SO I NEED TO KNOW WHO ELSE
WANTED TO SEE HIM DEAD.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.854
THE POLICE TOOK
ALL THE HIGH HEELS
IN MY HOUSE.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.312
MY MOTHER'S, MINE.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.258
THAT'S BARBARIC.

19:59.290 --> 20:02.623
YOU SAID THERE WAS
A WOMAN'S SHOEPRINT
WHERE WILDEN WAS KILLED.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.596
ARE THEY GOING TO FIND
A MATCH WITH SOMETHING
FROM YOUR MOM'S CLOSET?

20:06.630 --> 20:08.336
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.462
WHY NOT?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.331
'CAUSE THERE'S A PAIR MISSING.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.928
MANOLOS.
THEY HAD MUD ON THEM.

20:12.970 --> 20:15.734
THEY WERE HIDDEN
UNDER THE SINK,
AND THEN THEY WERE GONE.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.771
YOU THREW THEM OUT.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.243
NO, THEY JUST
WEREN'T THERE ANYMORE.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.443
NO, HANNA,
YOU THREW THEM OUT.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.845
THEY'RE THE SHOES
YOU WERE WEARING

20:23.890 --> 20:26.518
WHEN YOU MET WILDEN AT THE LAKE
AND SHOT HIM.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.551
I DID?

20:27.590 --> 20:29.478
YOU TRIED TO CLEAN THEM
AND WHEN YOU COULDN'T,

20:29.520 --> 20:30.748
YOU THREW THEM AWAY.

20:30.790 --> 20:33.793
YOU WORE THOSE SHOES
THAT NIGHT, NOT YOUR MOTHER.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.798
YOU THREW THEM OUT.

20:35.830 --> 20:39.391
I THREW THEM OUT
BECAUSE THEY WERE MY MOM'S

20:39.430 --> 20:42.991
AND I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
TO THINK THAT THOSE
WERE HER PRINTS.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.238
YOU SEE?
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW,
DOESN'T IT?

20:48.640 --> 20:52.508
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GUN.

20:57.650 --> 21:00.483
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU CAME
FROM PERFECT TOWN, U.S.A.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.056
ZOE, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

21:02.090 --> 21:02.954
HEY.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.754
THIS TOWN IS ALMOST
AS PHOTOGENIC AS YOU.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.291
ALMOST.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.820
WAS THIS REALLY ON YOUR WAY?

21:08.860 --> 21:10.919
IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.428
I FIGURED
WHEN I GOT YOUR EMAIL,
IT WAS WORTH THE DETOUR.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.859
SO WHERE YOU BEEN,
JOE DIMAGGIO?

21:18.910 --> 21:21.629
YOU DON'T CALL,
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED
ANY EMAILS,

21:21.680 --> 21:23.773
NOBODY'S HEARD FROM YOU
IN MONTHS.

21:23.810 --> 21:25.641
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.649
I REALLY DID WANNA
STAY IN TOUCH, IT'S JUST...

21:28.680 --> 21:30.648
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE, UM...

21:30.690 --> 21:32.578
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.588
KEEPING BUSY IS GOOD.

21:34.620 --> 21:38.329
I WAS JUST WORRIED
THAT YOU WERE STILL
DEALING WITH LOSING MAYA.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.328
STILL MISS HER.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.351
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.028
I SAW YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU GOT OFF THE PLANE.

21:45.070 --> 21:47.834
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
TAKE AN ENTIRE SUMMER
TO REBUILD YOU.

21:47.870 --> 21:51.806
WAS I ANY HELP AT ALL
THAT SUMMER OR WAS I
JUST ANOTHER DISASTER AREA?

21:51.840 --> 21:52.864
EXCUSE ME?

21:52.910 --> 21:55.799
BY THE THIRD DAY, YOU WERE
M.V.P. OF THE ENTIRE TEAM.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.378
WE HAD TO PRY
THE ELECTRIC DRILL
OUT OF YOUR HANDS.

22:00.580 --> 22:02.411
I'M PUTTING A CREW TOGETHER
THIS SUMMER,

22:02.450 --> 22:04.543
AND I WISH I HAD AN EMILY
ON EVERY SINGLE TEAM.

22:04.590 --> 22:06.444
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
GOING THIS SUMMER?

22:06.490 --> 22:07.980
NICARAGUA.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.578
WHY? DO YOU WANNA COME?

22:14.130 --> 22:19.420
I DON'T THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU
EXPECTED WHEN YOU GOT INVOLVED
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.961
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.934
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.666
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.132
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HANNA.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.602
SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.608
I CAN'T HELP HER FROM HERE.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.744
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING FROM HERE.

22:34.780 --> 22:38.489
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT SHE MIGHT DO...

22:38.520 --> 22:41.978
IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.988
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?

22:44.030 --> 22:46.726
NOTHING.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.456
BUT I KNOW
HOW SHE THINKS AND...

22:49.500 --> 22:50.728
SHE WANTS RESULTS
AND SHE WILL CHARGE

22:50.770 --> 22:54.763
RIGHT INTO A SITUATION
WITHOUT THINKING AND...

22:54.800 --> 22:56.631
SHE GETS THAT FROM ME.

22:56.670 --> 22:59.503
I THINK SHE GETS
A LOT OF THINGS FROM YOU.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.577
SHE'S BRAVE,
SHE'S LOYAL. ..

23:02.610 --> 23:03.838
AND STUBBORN.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.677
SHE CAN BE.

23:05.710 --> 23:06.847
SHE'S VERY ANGRY RIGHT NOW,

23:06.880 --> 23:11.089
AND I DON'T WANT HER MAKING
ANY MISTAKES BECAUSE OF THAT.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.781
SHE LISTENS TO YOU.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.050
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

23:15.090 --> 23:17.058
SHE DOES.

23:17.090 --> 23:18.819
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.151
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.897
( sighs ) THANK YOU.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.535
Man: VISITING HOURS ARE NOW UP.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.607
VISITATION IS OVER.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.609
( sighs )

23:35.640 --> 23:37.574
MRS. MARIN...

23:39.880 --> 23:42.440
HANNA LOVES YOU.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.516
SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

23:44.550 --> 23:46.541
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

23:46.590 --> 23:48.558
( door buzzes )

23:53.060 --> 23:55.051
( door closes )

23:57.200 --> 23:59.623
SO YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN IN A POOL SINCE...

23:59.670 --> 24:01.160
THE ACCIDENT? NO.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.065
WOW.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.068
WELL, MAYBE WE NEED TO RETHINK
HANDING YOU THE POWER TOOLS.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.533
I MEAN, WE CAN FIND SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS PHYSICAL.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.536
NO, I'LL BE FINE
BY NEXT SUMMER.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.878
IT'S NOT PERMANENT,
THE INJURY.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.174
IT'S ALL BEHIND ME.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.176
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO SWIM IN COLLEGE AND --

24:16.220 --> 24:18.643
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SELL YOURSELF TO ME, EMILY.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.682
I COULD WRITE YOU
A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION
IN MY SLEEP.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.688
EMILY.
MOM.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.152
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:25.190 --> 24:26.953
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

24:26.990 --> 24:30.824
OH, THIS IS ZOE, UH,
MY SUPERVISOR FOR
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.464
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.537
I FIGURED YOU WERE
WORKING TODAY.

24:37.570 --> 24:38.969
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:39.010 --> 24:41.535
( sighs) I HAD TO MEET
WITH A SECOND ADJUSTOR,

24:41.580 --> 24:44.504
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE BACK IN OUR HOUSE
FOR MONTHS.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.643
BUT I NEED TO GET THIS
TO THE POLICE,

24:46.680 --> 24:48.545
AND I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE --

24:48.580 --> 24:50.980
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WALK IN THERE.

24:51.020 --> 24:54.114
I'LL DROP IT OFF.
THANKS.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.684
I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT HOME.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.551
WELL, BACK AT THE MOTEL.

24:57.590 --> 24:58.454
YEAH.

24:58.490 --> 25:00.697
IT WAS REALLY GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.891
YOU TOO.

25:06.770 --> 25:07.998
( clears throat )

25:08.040 --> 25:09.894
YOU'RE LIVING IN A MOTEL?

25:09.940 --> 25:13.637
( chuckles )
YEAH, JUST FOR NOW.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.739
IT'S A LONG STORY.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.941
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A LOT GOING ON.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.744
MAYBE I SHOULD'VE CHECKED IN
A LITTLE BIT MORE BEFORE
I ROPED YOU INTO THIS AGAIN.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.613
NO, I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS
NEXT SUMMER.

25:23.650 --> 25:26.949
IS THE SIGN-UP FORM IN HERE
OR SHOULD I DO IT ONLINE?

25:26.990 --> 25:29.652
( chuckles )

25:29.690 --> 25:31.658
WHERE DID YOU GET THE GUN?

25:31.690 --> 25:34.193
I FOUND IT IN MY FATHER'S DESK.

25:34.230 --> 25:37.893
I WAS AFRAID OF WILDEN,
SO I TOOK IT IN CASE
HE EVER TRIED ANYTHING.

25:37.930 --> 25:40.160
THEY FOUND YOUR MOTHER'S
FINGERPRINTS ON THE BULLETS.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.031
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

25:42.070 --> 25:45.039
LOOK, MY DAD HAD THAT GUN
WHEN HE LIVED WITH ME.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.163
MY MOM PROBABLY
LOADED IT ONCE.

25:47.210 --> 25:51.579
BUT I WAS THE FIRST ONE
TO EVER SHOOT IT.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.044
AND YOU SHOT IT AT WILDEN.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.069
YES.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.714
YOU FOLLOWED HIM TO THE LAKE
AND YOU SHOT HIM.

25:57.750 --> 25:59.718
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.217
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.284
WHAT?

26:02.320 --> 26:04.049
YOU KILLED SOMEONE.

26:04.090 --> 26:07.799
HE WAS AS CLOSE TO YOU
AS I AM AND YOU SHOT HIM.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.058
WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE?

26:09.100 --> 26:10.829
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?

26:10.870 --> 26:15.933
THE SORT OF QUESTION THAT WILL
LET THEM KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE
LYING OR TELLING THE TRUTH.

26:15.970 --> 26:19.235
MAKE ME BELIEVE YOU WERE THERE.
TELL ME WHAT YOU DID.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.076
HELLO, HANNA.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.315
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

26:30.350 --> 26:33.285
MOMMY'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO FIX THIS ONE FOR YOU, HANNA.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.709
Mona: AND JUST LIKE THAT,
YOU PULLED THE GUN ON HIM.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.728
SELF-DEFENSE, HANNA.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.388
REMEMBER?
WE'RE GOING FOR SELF-DEFENSE.

26:40.430 --> 26:44.264
HE MUST HAVE SAID SOMETHING,
DONE SOMETHING.

26:44.300 --> 26:46.268
WILDEN: BUT MAYBE YOU CAN
FIX THIS ONE FOR YOURSELF.

26:48.270 --> 26:51.205
I MEAN, YOU ARE
YOUR MOTHER'S DAUGHTER.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.338
( gunshot)

27:03.320 --> 27:03.911
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU.

27:04.690 --> 27:05.645
I KNOW.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.851
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE WITH YOUR DAD.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.878
HE HAD A WORK THING.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.128
( scoffs )

27:19.170 --> 27:21.297
HANNA, WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

27:21.340 --> 27:23.968
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.238
( sighs )

27:25.270 --> 27:28.876
CALEB, LOOK, MONA FOUND OUT
ABOUT MY MOM AND SHE CAME HERE.

27:28.910 --> 27:30.878
WE JUST...

27:30.910 --> 27:33.447
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE ON.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.449
MONA DOESN'T MOVE ON,
SHE GOES RIGHT THROUGH.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.981
DON'T YOU, MONA?

27:38.020 --> 27:39.840
( chuckles )

27:39.890 --> 27:42.711
I DON'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST INKLING
OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.058
CALEB, YOU WERE LOOKING FOR ME,
YOU FOUND ME, AND I'M OKAY.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.387
LIKE HELL YOU'RE OKAY.

27:46.430 --> 27:49.251
IT'S COMPLICATED
AND I DON'T DO COMPLICATED.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.995
OKAY, IF MY MOM
DOESN'T GET OUT OF JAIL,

27:51.030 --> 27:52.998
I HAVE TO MOVE IN
WITH MY DAD, HIS WIFE,

27:53.030 --> 27:55.260
HER BLONDE TARANTULA
OF A DAUGHTER.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.758
SO COMPARED TO THAT,
TALKING TO MONA MAKES
ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD.

27:58.810 --> 28:01.870
IT'S MY CALMING INFLUENCE.

28:01.910 --> 28:04.276
GOD, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

28:04.310 --> 28:07.006
OKAY? FOR NOW.

28:07.050 --> 28:09.439
( scoffs ) SURE.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.209
I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

28:21.230 --> 28:24.097
WE'RE ALMOST FINISHED.

28:27.770 --> 28:28.998
( door opens )

28:29.040 --> 28:30.735
HEY.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.101
HI.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.506
HONEY, YOUR DAD
WANTS YOU TO MEET HIM
AT THE CLUB FOR DINNER.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.474
WE'RE GONNA BE
WORKING HERE FOR AWHILE.

28:36.510 --> 28:37.977
OKAY.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.942
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU LEAVE.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.481
YOU WERE BUSY.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.408
BY THE WAY...

28:46.450 --> 28:48.281
( whispering )
DO YOU WANT ME TO SLIP
THAT FILE BACK IN THE BOX

28:48.320 --> 28:50.015
BEFORE YOUR MOTHER NOTICES?

28:50.060 --> 28:52.153
WHAT FILE?

28:54.060 --> 28:56.290
( chuckles )

28:56.330 --> 28:58.867
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.936
SUIT YOURSELF.

29:15.150 --> 29:18.210
(vehicle approaching )

29:18.250 --> 29:21.481
( engine rewing )

29:21.520 --> 29:23.511
( tires screeching )

29:29.430 --> 29:31.421
( tires screeching )

29:36.100 --> 29:37.806
( dialing )

29:37.840 --> 29:39.102
( ringing )

29:39.140 --> 29:41.836
Boy: MIKE'S PHONE.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.233
WHO'S THIS?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.475
MIKE'S BUTLER. WHO'S THIS?

29:45.510 --> 29:49.071
IT'S HIS SISTER.
CAN YOU JUST PUT HIM
ON THE PHONE, PLEASE?

29:49.120 --> 29:52.510
HEY, GUYS. GUYS,
IS MIKE BACK THERE?

29:52.550 --> 29:55.519
( chuckling )
HE'S NOT CONSCIOUS.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.857
YET. ( laughs )

29:56.890 --> 29:58.528
JUST PUT MIKE
ON THE PHONE OKAY?

29:58.560 --> 30:00.994
NOW.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.520
HELLO?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.528
( phone clicks )

30:04.570 --> 30:07.869
HELLO?

30:07.900 --> 30:11.006
( sighs )

30:11.040 --> 30:12.132
( sighs )

30:12.170 --> 30:13.899
( dialing )

30:17.280 --> 30:19.271
Mona: TELL ME AGAIN.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.277
I SAW HIM IN TOWN.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.309
YOU SAW WHO IN TOWN?

30:23.350 --> 30:25.238
DETECTIVE WILDEN.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.588
I FOLLOWED HIM
OUT TO THE LAKE,

30:27.620 --> 30:29.156
AND I SAW HIS CAR THERE.

30:29.190 --> 30:31.420
BUT THEY FOUND
HIS CAR IN TOWN.

30:31.460 --> 30:33.519
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,

30:33.560 --> 30:35.596
BUT I SAW HIS CAR AT THE LAKE.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.860
DID YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE THERE?

30:37.900 --> 30:40.391
NO.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.399
WILDEN WAS...

30:43.440 --> 30:45.101
ANGRY.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.473
HE'S GONNA BLAME
ALL OF THIS ON MY MOM.
I KNOW IT.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.410
HE'S BEEN AFTER
ME AND MY MOM.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.441
WHY?
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE DID TO ALI.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.040
NO ONE BELIEVES US.
NO ONE WILL HELP US.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.081
HE WANTS TO HURT MY MOM.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.878
Hanna: WELL, NOW IT'S HIS TURN
TO BE SCARED.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.319
AND I'M GONNA MAKE HIM STOP.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.389
YOU DID THIS.

31:11.430 --> 31:15.639
I'LL DO WORSE IF YOU
DON'T LEAVE US ALONE.

31:15.670 --> 31:18.969
YOU'RE IN VERY BIG TROUBLE,
HANNA.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.501
I CAN MAKE YOUR MOTHER'S LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.973
( gun cocks )

31:23.010 --> 31:26.673
UNLESS, THAT IS, YOU AND I
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.416
HE HURT YOUR MOM.
HE WANTS TO HURT YOU.

31:28.450 --> 31:31.112
HE'S GOT ALL THE POWER.
NOBODY'S GOING TO HELP YOU.

31:31.150 --> 31:34.256
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD
WHO CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.848
YOU'RE ALL ALONE OUT THERE.

31:35.890 --> 31:39.189
BUGS ARE GETTING IN YOUR HAIR
AND THE LAKE SMELLS LIKE
SOMETHING DIED IN IT.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.925
Mona: WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

31:42.460 --> 31:45.566
( gunshot)

31:51.710 --> 31:53.007
TWO, HAN NA.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.304
YOU SHOT HIM TWICE.

31:57.580 --> 31:58.899
( gunshot)

32:20.370 --> 32:22.338
AND THEN I RAN AWAY.

32:22.370 --> 32:24.406
WHO MOVED THE CAR
AND PUT THE BODY IN THE TRUNK?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.658
I DON'T KNOW.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.406
ALL I KNOW IS I KILLED HIM.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.273
I SHOT HIM
WITH MY FATHER'S GUN
'CAUSE HE WAS AFTER MY MOM

32:32.310 --> 32:34.414
AND NO ONE WAS GONNA HELP US.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.214
ARE YOU SORRY
THAT YOU KILLED HIM?

32:40.490 --> 32:43.459
( sighs ) YEAH.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.583
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.484
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.719
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW
IS TELL THE TRUTH...

32:53.770 --> 32:57.035
AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

33:23.530 --> 33:25.259
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

33:27.500 --> 33:30.537
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA
LEAVE YOU ALONE WITH HER,
DID YOU?

33:33.140 --> 33:34.539
( knocking )

33:36.610 --> 33:37.577
HI.

33:37.610 --> 33:38.702
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.308
NO.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.443
WHERE DOES THE TEAM
USUALLY HANG AFTER THE GAME?

33:42.480 --> 33:45.210
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST KNOW
THAT THEY PLAYED RICHLAND.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.616
UH, WAS HE AT A HOUSE PARTY?

33:47.650 --> 33:51.086
WELL, IT KIND OF SOUNDED LIKE
HE WAS AT A BOWLING ALLEY,
JUST NOT AS LOUD.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.485
THERE WERE ALL THESE
CRASHES AND PINGS AND --

33:53.530 --> 33:54.792
Both: AN ARCADE.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.650
I KNOW A PLACE NEAR THERE.

33:56.700 --> 34:00.397
UH, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T REMEMBER THE STREET.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.068
OKAY, UM...

34:02.100 --> 34:04.239
SHOULD WE JUST GET IN YOUR CAR
AND DRIVE THERE?

34:04.270 --> 34:05.760
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.368
( phone rings )

34:07.410 --> 34:08.570
HOLD ON, IT'S HIM.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.838
( phone beeps )

34:09.880 --> 34:11.848
MIKE, HEY. WHERE ARE YOU?

34:11.880 --> 34:15.077
YOUR FRIEND SAID THAT
YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.075
Mike: UNDRESSED?

34:16.120 --> 34:18.179
NO, NOT UNDRESSED. UNCONSCIOUS.

34:18.220 --> 34:20.484
HE WAS JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.353
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:23.390 --> 34:25.620
Mike: YES, I'M FINE.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.753
I MIGHT JUST STAY
AT BILLY'S TONIGHT.

34:27.790 --> 34:29.724
YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME AT ALL?

34:29.760 --> 34:33.093
IT'S THREE BLOCKS AWAY, OKAY?
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.429
( phone clicks )

34:37.200 --> 34:37.996
( phone beeps )

34:38.040 --> 34:40.338
WHY WOULD HE JUST
PUT ME THROUGH THAT?

34:40.370 --> 34:43.339
HE DOESN'T KNOW I TOLD YOU
ABOUT HIS TEAMMATES.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.746
SO HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW WHY
TONIGHT SCARED YOU SO MUCH.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.748
RIGHT.

34:47.780 --> 34:50.169
GREAT, SO NOW
I'M SPYING ON HIM.

34:50.220 --> 34:51.346
( chuckles )

34:53.490 --> 34:55.310
YOU'RE HIS SISTER.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.850
MIKE'S A GREAT GUY.

34:56.890 --> 34:59.586
HE'S GOT HIS STRUGGLES,
BUT HE'S WORKING ON 'EM.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.450
I THINK HE CAN
TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.252
YOU THINK?

35:03.300 --> 35:06.827
IF IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL,
I'LL TELL YOU.

35:06.870 --> 35:09.464
OKAY.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.731
AND HONESTLY...

35:12.770 --> 35:15.603
I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.471
YOU WANT ME TO STAY FOR AWHILE?

35:17.510 --> 35:19.705
YEAH, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

35:19.750 --> 35:21.342
I'LL TAKE THAT AT A YES.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.870
AND YOU LET MONA
TALK YOU INTO THIS?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.888
MONA IS HELPING ME.
IT WAS MY IDEA.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.217
HANNA, IT'S INSANE.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.683
SECOND OF ALL,
YOU WOULD NEVER PULL IT OFF.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.688
AND THIRD,
I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU DO IT.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.198
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

35:34.230 --> 35:36.698
MAYBE "A" WILL
SETTLE FOR RUINING MY LIFE
AND LEAVE MY MOTHER ALONE.

35:36.730 --> 35:38.618
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
IS GOING TO PRISON.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.490
MY MOTHER'S ALREADY THERE.

35:40.530 --> 35:43.636
IF THEY TAKE HER AWAY TOMORROW,
I'LL NEVER GET HER BACK.

35:43.670 --> 35:46.161
LOOK, IT'LL BE OKAY.
I'LL BE FINE.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.199
YOU WILL BE FINE?

35:47.240 --> 35:49.629
HANNA, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT GOING TO PRISON, OKAY?

35:49.680 --> 35:51.545
PRISON FOR KIDS
IS STILL PRISON.

35:51.580 --> 35:54.549
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO SOMETHING
JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY

35:54.580 --> 35:57.413
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE DID.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.509
YOU THINK SHE KILLED HIM.

35:59.550 --> 36:03.281
YOU THINK MY MOM SHOT WILDEN.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.398
I DID, OKAY?

36:08.430 --> 36:10.250
UNTIL I TALKED TO HER TODAY.

36:10.300 --> 36:12.461
SHE NEVER KILLED ANYONE.

36:16.940 --> 36:17.895
( door opens )

36:17.940 --> 36:19.202
Emily: HEY.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.366
( door closes )

36:20.410 --> 36:22.970
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GOING SHOPPING.
I COULD'VE HELPED.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.672
I JUST PICKED UP
SOME OF THE ESSENTIALS.

36:25.710 --> 36:29.942
UM, WE'RE GONNA TRY TO EAT OUT
MOST OF THE TIME.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.140
DID YOU DROP OFF THE --

36:31.180 --> 36:34.911
YEAH, AND EVERYBODY
AT THE PRECINCT
ASKED ABOUT YOU.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.916
THEY'RE GONNA
WANT YOU BACK, MOM.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.281
I THINK THEY
ALREADY FEEL BAD.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.958
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW THEY FEEL, EM.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.424
IT'S, UH...
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

36:45.470 --> 36:48.633
I'M GONNA BE STARTING TO LOOK
FOR OTHER WORK TOMORROW.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.638
I HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH ZOE.

36:50.670 --> 36:53.639
SHE'S GONNA WRITE ME
A RECOMMENDATION LETTER
FOR COLLEGE.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.448
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.540
I'M GLAD THERE'S
SOMEONE IN YOUR CORNER.

37:01.580 --> 37:06.813
SHE'S LEADING A CREW
IN JUNE TO NICARAGUA,
INVITED ME TO COME.

37:06.850 --> 37:10.650
WANTS ME TO JOIN THE GROUP
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER
UNTIL I START SCHOOL.

37:16.630 --> 37:19.599
SHE EVEN SAID THAT
SHE'D GIVE ME SOME SORT
OF LEADERSHIP ROLE

37:19.630 --> 37:21.336
WHERE I'D BE, LIKE,
A TEAM CAPTAIN OR SOMETHING

37:21.370 --> 37:25.238
AND SUPERVISE
THE NEW VOLUNTEERS.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.359
MOM?

37:27.410 --> 37:30.004
WHAT'S WRONG?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.747
NOTHING.

37:32.780 --> 37:36.318
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

37:36.350 --> 37:38.580
I DON'T HAVE TO GO
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.315
I CAN COME BACK IN AUGUST.

37:40.350 --> 37:42.557
YOU KNOW, SEE WHAT HAPPENS
WITH THE HOUSE.

37:42.590 --> 37:43.784
MAYBE IF DAD COMES BACK,
HE CAN SPEND TIME --

37:43.820 --> 37:48.723
STOP. YOU DON'T NEED OT ORGANIZE
YOUR WHOLE CALENDAR AROUND ME.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.899
THIS IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT SUMMER FOR YOU.

37:50.930 --> 37:53.797
MOM...

37:55.670 --> 37:57.433
HAVE YOU EATEN?

37:57.470 --> 38:00.303
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

38:05.810 --> 38:08.745
(crying )

38:17.520 --> 38:19.488
I'M SORRY.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.852
I'M SO SORRY.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.595
(crying )

38:24.630 --> 38:26.461
WE CAN EAT LATER, OKAY?

38:26.500 --> 38:28.365
I'LL FIX YOU SOMETHING.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.832
**

38:47.090 --> 38:50.116
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO A DETECTIVE.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.823
ABOUT A MURDER.

39:05.470 --> 39:08.837
HEY, I'M SORRY
IF I HIJACKED YOUR NIGHT.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.007
IT'S FINE.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.600
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

39:13.650 --> 39:14.878
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU
IN THE MOOD FOR?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.945
COMEDY? ROM-COM? SCI-FI?

39:16.980 --> 39:19.448
* TIPTOE THROUGH
THE TULIPS WITH ME *

39:19.490 --> 39:20.946
( screams )

39:20.990 --> 39:23.686
INSIDIOUS 2.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.551
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE FIRST ONE?

39:25.590 --> 39:26.921
TWICE.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.919
THIS ONE LOOKS
EVEN MORE TERRIFYING.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.929
FUN TERRIFYING.

39:33.970 --> 39:36.791
IT OPENS NEXT WEEKEND.
YOU WANNA GO?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.809
SURE, IT'S A --

39:39.840 --> 39:42.570
( chuckles )
SOUNDS GOOD.

39:58.090 --> 39:59.785
OH, HI.

39:59.830 --> 40:00.888
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF BECKETT?

40:00.930 --> 40:03.922
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING YET.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.929
YOU'LL LIKE HIM. HE'S SMART.

40:06.970 --> 40:09.063
DID YOU TALK TO HAN NA?

40:09.100 --> 40:10.397
YEAH, SHE'S WITH HER DAD.

40:13.570 --> 40:15.071
WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO HER MOM?

40:15.110 --> 40:18.546
THEY'LL MOVE HER TO
THE STATE FACILITY TOMORROW,

40:18.580 --> 40:22.038
WHICH IS EXCESSIVE
AND INTERFERES WITH MY
ABILITY TO MOUNT A DEFENSE,

40:22.080 --> 40:25.686
AND I'LL KEEP AFTER JUDGE REILLY
UNTIL SHE AGREES TO BAIL.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.453
MEANWHILE, SHE STAYS IN A CELL?

40:28.490 --> 40:30.412
YEAH.

40:38.930 --> 40:41.490
OH, I SHOULD HAVE
WARN ED BECKETT ABOUT YOU.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.996
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE?

40:43.040 --> 40:44.860
THEY'RE TRYING TO CHOKE US
WITH WILDEN MATERIAL.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.002
MOST OF IT'S USELESS.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.564
THAT IS NOT USELESS.

40:47.610 --> 40:50.909
THAT IS ABOUT WILDEN
AND RADLEY AND TOBY'S MOM.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.473
WILDEN WAS AT RADLEY
THE NIGHT THAT TOBY'S MOM DIED,

40:55.520 --> 40:58.739
AND WHAT HE WROTE
IN HIS NOTES DOESN'T MATCH
THE OFFICIAL REPORT.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.883
SOMEBODY PAID HIM OFF
TO LIE ABOUT THE FACTS.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.808
IT'S NOT RELEVANT.
NOT RELEVANT?

41:02.860 --> 41:06.557
WILDEN WAS CROOKED,
HE WAS ALWAYS CROOKED.

41:09.060 --> 41:13.759
MOM, TOBY THINKS
HIS MOTHER KILLED HERSELF.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.030
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T.

41:16.070 --> 41:19.062
AND THIS LINKS WHAT HAPPENED
OUT THERE WITH WILDEN.

41:19.110 --> 41:22.534
HONEY, NOTHING WE DO OR SAY
IS GONNA BRING BACK
TOBY'S MOTHER.

41:22.580 --> 41:26.209
IF YOU WANT TO HELP TOBY,
HELP HIM MOVE ON.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.899
( phone rings )

41:28.920 --> 41:30.615
( phone
be
YES? eps )

41:32.250 --> 41:33.717
NO, I HAVEN'T.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.587
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:40.560 --> 41:41.822
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

41:44.160 --> 41:46.822
ALL RIGHT, I'LL COME
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

41:46.870 --> 41:48.838
( phone beeps )

41:48.870 --> 41:51.737
MONA VAN DERWAAL
IS AT THE POLICE STATION.

41:51.770 --> 41:55.570
SHE JUST WALKED IN AND
CONFESSED TO KILLING WILDEN.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.574
( phone rings )

42:02.820 --> 42:06.813
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

42:10.320 --> 42:14.051
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

42:17.930 --> 42:21.593
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

42:25.670 --> 42:29.902
* OH, OH, OH, OH, OH

42:29.940 --> 42:35.310
* GOOD GIRLS DO BAD THINGS

42:35.350 --> 42:39.309
* SOMETIMES

42:39.350 --> 42:43.912
* BUT WE GET BY WITH IT

42:45.090 --> 42:51.097
* GOOD GIRLS DO BAD THINGS

42:51.130 --> 42:54.839
* SOMETIMES

42:54.870 --> 42:57.691
* BUT WE GET BY WITH IT

42:57.740 --> 43:00.561
