WEBVTT

00:05.180 --> 00:08.010
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:08.029 --> 00:10.010
The fuck did you do?

00:10.030 --> 00:13.090
Nobody panic. This happens all
the time with director's cuts.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.220
We recut the film.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.080
You said there was something
you needed to talk about?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.210
I'm pregnant.

00:18.230 --> 00:20.050
It's yours.

00:20.070 --> 00:21.140
I don't mean to be harsh,

00:21.160 --> 00:23.050
but I really don't want
your Mormon opinion

00:23.070 --> 00:25.010
on how to handle this.

00:25.030 --> 00:27.050
We just wanna make sure\h
that you're being looked after.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.210
So, this button here

00:29.200 --> 00:31.130
is a recording device.

00:31.150 --> 00:34.060
Even if Amara's people do a
scan, they won't find it,

00:34.080 --> 00:35.160
because there's no transmitter.

00:35.180 --> 00:37.060
Wow.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.150
$2.6 million in product.

00:39.170 --> 00:42.100
As of today, we have
30 days to pay our supplier.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.220
I see why that's an issue.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.140
I wish I could help.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.040
When can she expect
to recoup her investment?

00:49.060 --> 00:51.120
You need to take\h a hard
fucking look\h at yourself.

00:51.140 --> 00:53.000
Meaning what?

00:53.020 --> 00:54.190
You and Katie\h
are getting a divorce,

00:54.210 --> 00:55.230
but you gotta face it,

00:56.010 --> 00:57.370
instead of
drinking yourself blind.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.320
You're trying to\h drive yourself
into\h the ground, buddy.

01:01.130 --> 01:02.250
I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
Hey, George.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.070
Morning.

01:37.090 --> 01:38.180
You on my flight?

01:38.200 --> 01:41.190
No. I'm headed over for editing.

01:41.210 --> 01:44.010
I'm gonna sit in with
Miles and Rick.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.050
What time is your flight?

01:45.070 --> 01:46.150
10:20.

01:47.110 --> 01:48.230
You're gonna be early.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.100
How I like it.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.030
I heard it was cooler now
in Pahrump.

01:57.050 --> 01:59.230
In August, it was hot, boy.

02:00.010 --> 02:01.150
I'd get ice in a hand towel,

02:01.170 --> 02:03.200
just sat on my head
while I watched TV.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.070
Yeah, I don't miss that part.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.090
This is George.

02:13.110 --> 02:16.000
George, I'm very stressful now.

02:16.020 --> 02:17.090
You know why.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.130
Okay.

02:19.150 --> 02:22.170
LA don't give us product
till I pay for what we lost.

02:22.190 --> 02:25.040
No product, then I don't
make money to buy product.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.090
It's a problem.

02:26.110 --> 02:28.000
I understand.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.040
So tell me what to do.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.000
It's your job, no?

02:32.020 --> 02:34.200
We were counting on the funds
invested in the movie.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.120
Movie's not good.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.100
They work on it,
but we don't know.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.210
In retrospect,

02:39.230 --> 02:41.170
we should have had\h
more of a cushion.

02:42.150 --> 02:43.130
Cushion?

02:43.150 --> 02:45.190
Money set aside for emergencies.

02:47.050 --> 02:48.140
Yes, you should.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.020
My assumption was

02:50.040 --> 02:52.090
the financial risk in this
case was acceptable...

02:52.110 --> 02:54.220
George, can you fix this or not?

02:56.150 --> 02:58.170
I...

02:58.190 --> 03:01.060
Well, you said they're
working on the movie.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.090
If the cut improves and they can
sell it when it's released...

03:04.110 --> 03:05.270
He don't work for me no more.

03:08.030 --> 03:09.180
George, it's Ross.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.180
She says you don't\h
work for her anymore.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.070
All right, then.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.110
Amara.

03:26.190 --> 03:29.130
It's just as well I'm leaving.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.090
All right if I smoke this?

03:42.110 --> 03:43.170
Sure.

04:17.060 --> 04:18.140
God damn it.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.150
George,

04:24.170 --> 04:26.040
I feel shitty about this.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.300
Spare me the heartfelt apology.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.180
You can finish the smoke.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.200
Nah.

04:33.220 --> 04:36.230
If I'd known, I'd have
got the expensive ones.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.150
See how long you last
working for her.

04:58.150 --> 05:01.100
Forgive me, my Lord,
Lady Margaret and I

05:01.120 --> 05:04.090
have been acquainted
since our infancy.

05:04.110 --> 05:07.230
I have long considered her
a friend.

05:08.010 --> 05:11.050
Some say you consider her
more than that.

05:11.070 --> 05:14.000
Still others hint at\h
a history of impropriety.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.050
On your part and hers.

05:16.070 --> 05:17.180
Okay, stop.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.080
- This shot.
- -Totally on the same page.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.160
That's gotta be shorter.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.210
- Longer.
- Longer?

05:22.230 --> 05:24.210
Well, we agree it's not working.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.080
How many frames you wanna add?

05:27.110 --> 05:28.160
- Frames?
- Frames.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.090
Yeah, that's 1/24th of a second.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.120
- Let's add three frames.
- Three?

05:33.140 --> 05:36.030
You're not gonna even
see the difference.

05:36.050 --> 05:38.220
All right, look.
Let's go on a coffee run.

05:39.000 --> 05:39.230
Can we?

05:40.010 --> 05:41.100
We're gonna pull
an allnighter here.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.060
I haven't done that
since college.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.720
Hey, festival rep from Santa Barbara
said they really need the cut.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.050
Are you muted?

05:48.070 --> 05:49.110
I can mail 'em a copy.

05:49.130 --> 05:51.130
Here's the problem.
If they get it,

05:51.150 --> 05:53.010
they're gonna watch it.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.070
- Stall for time?
- Yes.

05:55.090 --> 05:56.170
Hi, Danielle.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.130
See?

05:57.150 --> 05:59.060
Better.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.170
Right? That's what's so
amazing about this, editing.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.010
You make a tiny change
like that,

06:03.030 --> 06:04.210
but on some level
you just feel it.

06:04.230 --> 06:08.100
Sorry, I haven't actually
made the change yet.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.060
Hello.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.010
Ooh! It smells like people.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.050
How's it going?

06:15.070 --> 06:17.020
Yeah, it's...

06:18.020 --> 06:19.100
Yeah.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.000
So, this is my last day.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.180
I wanted to bring Reed Jennings.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.070
He's taking over for me.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.100
Three days till the Santa
Barbara Film Festival.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.140
It's exciting.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.180
You're the new April?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.180
Bet that's disappointing.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.020
Not at all.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.070
Could be an upgrade.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.070
You brought muffins.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.150
To compensate for abandoning us.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.020
Well, that works for me.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.150
Let me get one.

06:39.170 --> 06:41.100
I'm on the lot today.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.150
But in case I don't
see you guys...

06:43.170 --> 06:44.200
Thanks, April.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.190
- Okay.
- Good luck.

06:46.210 --> 06:48.100
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.070
- Listen, you too.
- Thanks.

06:51.090 --> 06:53.100
Lady Margaret\h
and I have been...

06:53.120 --> 06:55.020
Miles, I'm leaving.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.140
Yeah. Heard that.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.070
Thanks for stopping by, Reed.

06:58.090 --> 07:00.010
Of course.

07:00.030 --> 07:03.030
Lady Margaret\h
and I have been...

07:06.160 --> 07:07.440
consider her\h more than that.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.160
Tia, where are you going?

07:14.180 --> 07:15.190
See my movie.

07:15.210 --> 07:17.070
- Should I come?
- No.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.140
But they're going.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.120
Listen, Tia...

07:24.140 --> 07:26.130
I know we're low
on cash right now,

07:26.150 --> 07:28.200
so I've been working
on this job.

07:28.220 --> 07:30.170
Gunner's brotherinlaw
is a contractor,

07:30.190 --> 07:32.110
and he has these alarm
codes, and they...

07:32.130 --> 07:33.210
Don't tell me.

07:34.170 --> 07:37.000
Okay. Yeah, right.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.090
Just know that
I'm doing this for us.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.130
I'm trying to bring in revenue.

07:41.150 --> 07:44.120
So can I put Ed up on this? Some of the
other guys so that we can get this...

07:44.140 --> 07:47.040
I don't care.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.080
All right. Well, I'll
circle back on this.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.050
You're in, Manuel.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.210
In on what?

07:57.230 --> 08:00.050
Yo, she has me doing
the whole house.

08:00.070 --> 08:02.140
Can you help out?

08:02.160 --> 08:04.120
I've taken the measure\h
of many ladies.

08:04.140 --> 08:06.130
I just can't remember
what it looked like before.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.040
Hey, hey, hey, everybody.

08:09.190 --> 08:11.000
How's it going?

08:11.020 --> 08:11.210
Fine.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.160
- Yeah? I mean...
- Yeah.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.000
Is it better?

08:15.020 --> 08:16.090
We're working as fast
as we can, Lulu.

08:16.110 --> 08:18.010
Okay.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.020
'Cause Amara is not in a
good mood, and she's,

08:21.040 --> 08:22.100
coming over.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.140
- Now?
- Here?

08:23.160 --> 08:25.010
Ed and Gunner are
waiting outside.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.030
I...

08:26.050 --> 08:27.170
I don't have anything
to show her yet.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.070
Really? You've had
a couple of days.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.140
- For fuck's sake.
- Hey, two days

08:30.160 --> 08:32.020
is nothing on a feature film.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.140
Okay? I know we're
on a deadline, but...

08:33.159 --> 08:34.140
Okay. I don't mean
to stress you out.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.059
Well, you fucking are.

08:37.070 --> 08:38.070
Let's see the first one.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.090
George is gone.

08:44.110 --> 08:45.140
- No!
- That's what I mean.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.040
She's in a mood.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.030
Shit.

08:50.050 --> 08:52.020
Watch this one. I think...
I don't know.

08:59.220 --> 09:01.070
I sent you a message.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.110
Maybe you didn't get it.

09:02.130 --> 09:03.220
I got all five.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.180
I don't think I sent that many.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.190
Hey, do you remember
what I said?

09:07.210 --> 09:09.120
I need to figure this out
on my own.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.150
Can I just talk to you outside?

09:10.170 --> 09:12.010
Hey, it's Gladys.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.140
Maybe later.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.140
I think it's still dragging.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.030
It's still dragging.

09:17.050 --> 09:18.060
This yours?

09:18.080 --> 09:20.030
I don't drink coffee.

09:20.050 --> 09:20.220
Why's that?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.110
Honestly, I take Adderall,

09:23.130 --> 09:24.180
so I'm already pretty revved up.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.210
You know, I'd just be like...

09:29.050 --> 09:31.060
Can I have one?

09:31.080 --> 09:33.140
They're prescription.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.210
I should hope so.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.360
What is it that you do again?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.100
I'm the assistant editor.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.190
Cheers.

09:44.210 --> 09:48.070
Let's just start from the beginning
again and see what happens.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.040
Hey!

09:50.060 --> 09:52.030
There she is.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.210
Good. You brought...

09:53.230 --> 09:55.040
A lot of people with you.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.170
Hey. Hi.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.080
Come on.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.940
This is your chair. Right here.
Sit right here.

10:01.170 --> 10:02.150
Amara.

10:02.170 --> 10:04.230
You fix my movie?

10:05.010 --> 10:06.150
I mean, it's coming along.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.150
Definite progress. Yeah.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.040
Show me.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.820
Well, we're still going
through it right now.

10:12.150 --> 10:13.190
Show me this part.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.050
Yeah. Okay, Fran.

10:15.070 --> 10:17.120
Just from the top of this scene
right here.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.120
But you gotta remember now,
it's gonna look and sound

10:19.140 --> 10:21.160
- much better once we do the final mix...
- Much better. Yeah.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.230
And the color timing.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.010
Let me see.

10:26.030 --> 10:30.010
Lady Margaret and I\h have been
acquainted\h since our infancy.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.270
I have long\h considered her...

10:40.140 --> 10:42.050
Go ahead.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.080
Got a cockroach.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.200
Where?\h - Office.

10:47.030 --> 10:49.040
Just one?\h - So far.

10:51.110 --> 10:53.120
I would be\h forced to correct...

10:53.140 --> 10:55.120
Stop it there. Thanks.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.000
So, yeah.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.210
It's, not good.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.120
Well, we're all in agreement
on that pretty much.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.170
I think if we shorten
this scene like a lot...

11:05.190 --> 11:07.040
It'll still be bad, Rick.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.020
It'll just take less time.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.280
You don't think there's some
dialogue that we could lift?

11:12.110 --> 11:15.120
That's to take some words out.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.100
Yes, you can do that. Yes?

11:17.120 --> 11:18.100
Take them out.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.190
Maybe not all the words.

11:19.210 --> 11:21.140
'Cause if the characters
don't have any words,

11:21.160 --> 11:24.010
I don't think people will know
what the fuck is going on.

11:24.030 --> 11:25.190
We could just lift the scene.

11:28.190 --> 11:30.070
Can you stop fucking panicking?

11:30.090 --> 11:31.180
We can fix this.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.130
Look, no offense, but you've
never cut a movie before.

11:33.150 --> 11:36.130
And you already tried to
fix it, and it's not good.

11:36.150 --> 11:38.020
- Cut the scene.
- No!

11:40.110 --> 11:41.110
No?

11:45.060 --> 11:47.080
If we lift every scene
that needs work,

11:47.100 --> 11:50.140
this film will have a total
of zero scenes.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.290
I can make it better. I can.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.370
Not just this bit,
the whole thing.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.100
I just need a bit of time,

11:56.120 --> 11:58.230
and maybe five less
cooks in the kitchen.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.150
You want me to leave?

12:00.170 --> 12:03.110
Okay. Hold on. It's not
like he can make it worse.

12:03.130 --> 12:06.020
So, it's just that we're
gonna have some buyers

12:06.040 --> 12:07.180
at the festival this weekend.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.120
- Cool, Ed's here.
- And we should just let it...

12:22.090 --> 12:24.020
You have one day.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.160
Fix it.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.020
Let's go, Ricky.

12:35.180 --> 12:38.000
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'll be right back.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.130
Hey!

12:48.150 --> 12:50.090
Hey.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.030
I gotta get back to the office.

12:52.050 --> 12:54.080
No, no. This isn't
about you being preg...

12:56.140 --> 12:57.230
Pregnant. This...

12:59.060 --> 13:03.080
You need space to decide
what's right for you.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.110
I respect that.

13:05.130 --> 13:06.150
Thank you.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.080
This is an intense situation,

13:11.100 --> 13:14.020
and, we don't

13:14.040 --> 13:17.230
know each other well,
but life is short, so...

13:19.210 --> 13:24.050
I'm thinking, what if we
just ignore that issue

13:24.070 --> 13:26.040
- and hang out?
- We can't date.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.090
You're Mormon, so no
sex before marriage.

13:28.110 --> 13:30.000
You think sex is part of dating?

13:30.020 --> 13:32.090
Yeah. Having the option, yes.

13:32.110 --> 13:35.110
Okay. So, my idea...
Just bear with me.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.170
If we get married?

13:38.190 --> 13:40.090
I know that sounds crazy, but

13:41.110 --> 13:42.200
we get married,

13:42.220 --> 13:45.070
and pretend it never happened.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.100
You just put it
out of your mind.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.000
Then we're just like two
people going on dates

13:50.020 --> 13:52.100
with the option to have sex.

13:54.030 --> 13:57.060
Except I'd be pregnant
and married.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.090
No, but don't think of it
like that.

13:59.110 --> 14:01.220
Just, you know,
give it two weeks.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.170
Two weeks!

14:03.190 --> 14:06.230
And if you're not feeling it,
then we'll just get divorced.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.020
Just think it over. Just...

14:21.200 --> 14:23.050
It was in my office?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.010
So maybe there's more?

14:27.030 --> 14:28.070
I checked the whole house.

14:28.090 --> 14:29.190
We're out here to be safe,

14:29.210 --> 14:31.060
just in case
we missed something.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.030
So what are we doing about it?

14:33.050 --> 14:34.330
We'll take a harder look inside.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.150
Check cars.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.290
Swap the burners and the SIM
cards on the smartphones.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.020
Someone is always home.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.440
How did the Feds
get into my office?

14:45.080 --> 14:47.180
Think of everyone
who has access.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.140
- There's us...
- Ross,

14:49.160 --> 14:50.210
Gunner, Nick...

14:50.230 --> 14:52.030
Benny.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.030
So, one of us is
working with the Feds?

14:54.050 --> 14:55.180
Just looking at possibilities.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.050
There's Tammy.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.070
Yeah.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.140
What about Rick?

15:08.010 --> 15:09.100
Rick don't go in there.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.160
He has access.

15:14.090 --> 15:16.010
You think Ricky do this?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.030
No. But you can't...

15:20.220 --> 15:22.070
So ask him.

15:30.020 --> 15:32.080
Yo, this job you wanna pull,

15:32.100 --> 15:33.160
we can't fuck with it.

15:33.180 --> 15:34.200
Not with this going on.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.090
We never talked about it inside.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.080
- It's not a good time, bro.
- Shut up.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.010
My Tia wants this to happen,

15:40.030 --> 15:41.100
and she wants you to help.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.120
Comprende?

15:44.190 --> 15:46.050
We're gonna check it out.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.030
I'll keep it close to my heart.

15:59.130 --> 16:01.060
They've released\h the moorings.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.050
That shot feels weird.

16:03.070 --> 16:04.100
Now, I'm taking notes from you.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.210
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to...

16:05.230 --> 16:08.070
I like it.

16:08.090 --> 16:12.000
You know, she turns away,
we see his expression.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.120
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.000
You know, we realize he's lying.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.080
Thank you. Robert,
come and sit with me.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.160
I was thinking,
when she turns away,

16:21.180 --> 16:24.010
that's when we jump back.

16:24.030 --> 16:25.000
You go a little wide.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.080
Yes, the wide.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.050
The wide. Fran, go
to the fucking wide.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.090
Feel her loneliness...

16:29.110 --> 16:31.060
Yes, good instincts, my man.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.170
I'm just reacting to
your vision...

16:32.190 --> 16:34.090
Give us another one
of those pills, please.

16:34.110 --> 16:36.040
I'll keep it\h
close to my heart.

16:37.180 --> 16:38.180
Play it again.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.460
Can you put your
fucking phone away?

16:44.230 --> 16:46.020
It's really distracting.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.130
I'm texting Gladys an apology.

16:51.050 --> 16:53.030
We went outside and talked,

16:53.050 --> 16:55.100
and I really put her
on the spot.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.230
Man!

16:57.010 --> 16:59.040
Okay. No. We'll talk about it
when you're finished working.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.140
Yeah, that'd be better,
wouldn't it?

17:01.160 --> 17:03.140
They've released\h the moorings.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.099
- She took it wrong.
- Unbelievable.

17:06.069 --> 17:08.140
Like I was proposing.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.030
Which I was. But, I mean, that...

17:10.050 --> 17:12.180
Proposing? Proposing what?

17:12.200 --> 17:15.030
Marriage? You asked her
to fucking marry you?

17:15.050 --> 17:17.010
She drove off,
so it's probably a no.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.119
You think?

17:18.140 --> 17:20.060
- Editing.
- I don't wanna distract you.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.020
Yeah, it's a bit too late
for that, isn't it?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.050
- It's Katie.
- On that phone.

17:26.130 --> 17:28.040
- Katie.
- Your cell is off.

17:28.060 --> 17:29.976
- Got this number\h from Production.\h.
- I'm in editing.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.030
Can you fit five in your car?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.370
The girls decided to
meet up here.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.070
Did they?

17:35.090 --> 17:37.140
Field hockey.\h You forget?

17:37.160 --> 17:39.010
No. No, no.

17:39.030 --> 17:42.060
Field hockey that I'm
taking the girls to. Yeah.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.030
Um, I'm kind of
under the gun here.

17:44.050 --> 17:45.120
Is there any way that
you could do it?

17:45.140 --> 17:46.180
I'm scrubbing into surgery
in 30 minutes.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.030
You said you could drive them.

17:48.050 --> 17:50.030
Yes, I did. I did. I said that.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.220
And I'll be right over.

17:53.010 --> 17:54.180
Fuck. Fuck.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.050
Fuck!

18:01.210 --> 18:03.060
Fuck.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.560
So that's the house
I'm talking about.

18:05.010 --> 18:06.140
Owner's not there.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.130
And he's got a dozen
contractors doing the remodel.

18:09.150 --> 18:12.080
They all have the alarms codes,
so he can't tell who did it.

18:12.100 --> 18:14.060
Yeah, but you don't know
what's in there.

18:14.080 --> 18:16.120
But they got something.

18:16.140 --> 18:20.050
Room in the back has a reinforced door.
Industrial lock.

18:20.070 --> 18:22.010
I'm thinking like jewelry.

18:22.030 --> 18:23.150
It could be wine.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.030
Wine?

18:26.050 --> 18:28.030
Yeah, maybe.

18:28.050 --> 18:30.450
Who do you know that's gonna
fence a bunch of expensive wine?

18:31.210 --> 18:33.200
Maybe it's diamonds.

18:33.220 --> 18:36.060
I mean, why the fuck
are we talking about wine?

18:38.210 --> 18:40.070
Is this about Nevada?

18:41.050 --> 18:42.190
Amara blaming you for the RV?

18:42.210 --> 18:43.210
She doesn't blame me.

18:45.140 --> 18:47.120
Why, what did she say?

18:47.140 --> 18:49.010
You wanna make it up to her?

18:49.030 --> 18:50.040
There's probably an easier way.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.180
Man, we're fucking broke.

18:52.220 --> 18:54.190
You culeros wanna\h
bring in revenue?

18:56.020 --> 18:58.000
Or you got an angle
that you haven't told me?

19:00.160 --> 19:02.190
Yeah, that's what I thought.

19:26.070 --> 19:27.160
No!

19:27.180 --> 19:30.010
Did this really happen?

19:30.030 --> 19:31.150
Come on, shake a leg.
Everybody in the car.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.050
Who's gonna help me
sing some Taylor Swift?

19:33.070 --> 19:35.310
- Boo! Are you kidding me?
- You don't like Taylor Swift?

19:36.010 --> 19:37.110
What's wrong with you people?
Come on, let's go.

19:37.130 --> 19:38.100
Okay, I'll be DJ.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:43.110 --> 19:45.010
You're sweating.

19:45.030 --> 19:46.090
Fuck. Yeah.

19:46.110 --> 19:48.010
I've been rushing
around all day.

19:48.030 --> 19:49.170
I got a deadline on the movie.

19:49.190 --> 19:51.010
Actually, come on, let's go.

19:51.030 --> 19:52.710
- Let's go. Move along.
- Okay, okay, okay.

19:53.230 --> 19:54.230
Miles?

19:56.010 --> 19:57.130
Can I give these to you?

19:58.200 --> 20:00.140
Sorry, there's no good time.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.140
You don't have to read 'em now.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.200
This is the divorce papers?

20:03.220 --> 20:05.060
So we can avoid lawyers.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.160
You know we both want that.

20:08.190 --> 20:10.110
I've, um, filled everything out.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.230
You can just look it
over when you have the time.

20:13.010 --> 20:15.110
Fuck!

20:15.130 --> 20:18.080
There's a part about
custody on page two.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.190
We said we were sharing custody.

20:31.210 --> 20:34.150
Well, you'll still see her
as often as you want.

20:34.170 --> 20:39.060
I mean, maybe not
overnights right away.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.220
Hey, but you will always be an
important part of her life.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.120
It's just, you know, with
everything that's happened,

20:45.140 --> 20:48.230
I thought this was
the safest arrangement.

20:54.060 --> 20:55.200
I thought you would agree.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.120
- Miles...
- Full custody?

21:01.170 --> 21:03.040
You're gonna take her
away from me.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.200
- No. No.
- Are you?

21:06.100 --> 21:08.100
Miles, I would never do that.

21:08.220 --> 21:10.030
Not ever.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.070
- I promise.
- Yeah.

21:14.090 --> 21:16.190
I'll... I'll get these
back to you.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.170
Thank you.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.070
All right, girls. Load 'em up.

21:22.090 --> 21:24.080
What are we gonna listen to?
Justin Bieber, is it?

21:24.100 --> 21:25.150
No!

21:47.100 --> 21:49.010
What's all this?

21:49.030 --> 21:50.050
Pest control.

21:50.070 --> 21:52.010
You know, mice, roaches.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.020
Really?

21:55.070 --> 21:56.140
I never saw anything.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.170
All right.

22:03.190 --> 22:05.180
Hope you're not
spraying that counter.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.120
I'm gonna be eating food here.

22:25.230 --> 22:27.220
You must agree\h
the view of my estate

22:28.000 --> 22:30.090
is quite impressive.\h
Quite impressive.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.160
Quite impressive.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.050
5:00.

22:34.070 --> 22:35.130
Where did the fucking day go?

22:35.150 --> 22:36.150
I think I got it.

22:36.170 --> 22:38.050
I play it from the top?

22:39.130 --> 22:41.030
These muffins are delicious.

22:42.210 --> 22:46.090
Do you think maybe I should
send a box to Gladys,

22:46.110 --> 22:48.140
with a note that says like,

22:48.160 --> 22:50.130
"I'm sorry I put
you on the spot"?

22:50.150 --> 22:51.180
Can you stop it there?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.180
Am I going fucking banan...

22:53.200 --> 22:56.010
Did I not just cut that line?

22:57.020 --> 22:58.070
Which one?

22:58.090 --> 22:59.140
The li...

23:00.050 --> 23:01.100
The...

23:01.120 --> 23:02.520
The line, which if I'm
not mistaken,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.440
you came up with
when we were on set.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.440
And apparently you snuck back in
when I was out taking a shit.

23:08.010 --> 23:09.180
I like it.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.360
- What's that now?
- The line.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.200
It helps establish a certain...

23:12.220 --> 23:14.130
Did anybody ask you
your opinion?

23:14.150 --> 23:17.150
Did somebody say, "You're
the editor's assistant."

23:17.170 --> 23:19.150
I wonder what your take
on this line is."

23:19.170 --> 23:21.180
Did you hear anybody
saying that, Robert?

23:22.140 --> 23:24.080
No.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.200
My name's Roger, actually.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.180
Will you please
excuse us, Roger?

23:34.160 --> 23:35.200
Play it again.

23:37.130 --> 23:38.210
Leave the line in.

23:45.140 --> 23:47.160
This wasn't my intention!

23:47.180 --> 23:48.200
This wasn't my intention!

23:48.220 --> 23:50.130
My intention!

23:59.170 --> 24:01.160
Is it just me,
or is it not flowing?

24:01.180 --> 24:04.110
- I'd better go.
- Hold on. Go where?

24:04.130 --> 24:05.230
Ed has me on a job.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.040
He didn't give me any details.

24:07.060 --> 24:09.080
He just said,
"Be there at 8:00."

24:09.100 --> 24:11.210
Wait... You can't leave.

24:11.230 --> 24:13.200
Honestly, man.
I'm not helping you.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.030
I've never edited anything.

24:15.050 --> 24:16.030
And neither have I, Lou.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.050
Well, that's true.

24:18.130 --> 24:19.200
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

24:19.220 --> 24:21.040
You don't like what I'm doing?

24:21.060 --> 24:22.160
No, I like...

24:22.180 --> 24:24.120
You said that you've never
tried, I said that's true.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.180
And what did you mean by that?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.040
You need to lay off
the pills, man.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.040
You're getting paranoid.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.040
Editing?

24:31.060 --> 24:32.040
I gotta go.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.040
Go, then.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.100
Wes Krupke for you.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.000
Good luck, - The fuck
is that supposed to mean?

24:37.020 --> 24:38.080
- Wes.
- Hold for Wes.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.060
My brother.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.200
- Your cell's off.\h.
- Yeah, 'cause I turned it off. Run that again.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.050
Hey, I just got off
the phone with CAA,

24:44.070 --> 24:46.040
and Amy Adams is reading.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.200
So I guess you straightened out
whatever's going on with her agent?

24:47.220 --> 24:49.090
Yeah, it was just a bit
of a misunderstanding.

24:49.110 --> 24:50.210
He's dropping the charges.

24:50.230 --> 24:52.120
What do you mean charges?

24:52.140 --> 24:54.120
That's good. I like that
when you put it there.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.130
Hello.\h - What?

24:56.150 --> 24:58.130
I like that...

24:58.150 --> 25:00.210
Miles, look, I'll let you go, but
I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right?

25:00.230 --> 25:02.170
I got a list of directors.
We're gonna go over it.

25:02.190 --> 25:04.090
Yeah, yeah, fantastic.
See you then.

25:04.110 --> 25:06.210
Yes, then we'll go to the
wide shot of the estate.

25:06.230 --> 25:08.070
That's what I fucking thought.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.180
You see, now it's got
that bit of shape to it.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.180
You feel that? That's momentum.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.180
- No! No!
- What? What?

25:14.200 --> 25:16.170
The drive's crashed second time.

25:16.190 --> 25:18.170
I gotta... I gotta reboot.

25:18.190 --> 25:20.130
What does that mean?

25:20.150 --> 25:22.170
It means restarting everything.

25:22.190 --> 25:24.060
Reloading...

25:24.080 --> 25:25.680
- It could take about an hour...
- For...

25:31.070 --> 25:33.230
No!

25:42.110 --> 25:43.170
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

25:43.190 --> 25:45.070
Excuse me.

25:46.130 --> 25:48.110
That's my stuff there.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.250
There's no roaches in there.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.190
- Can I come in?
- Is he with you?

25:54.210 --> 25:56.020
He's almost done.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.010
Can we talk?

25:59.030 --> 26:00.130
What?

26:00.150 --> 26:02.000
Here. Have a seat.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.010
When was the last time
you were in Amara's office?

26:16.090 --> 26:17.070
It's locked.

26:17.090 --> 26:19.140
So you tried the door.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.480
Did I? I don't know.
I don't know.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.000
I'm here a lot
and I look around.

26:23.180 --> 26:25.080
You been in the office?

26:25.100 --> 26:27.070
No.

26:27.090 --> 26:28.150
What if you found a key

26:28.170 --> 26:29.190
and just looked around?

26:29.210 --> 26:31.190
What key? I don't have a key.

26:31.210 --> 26:33.190
I wasn't in the office.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.230
What, somebody steal something?

26:36.010 --> 26:37.200
Has anyone approached you?

26:37.220 --> 26:39.120
Maybe they had questions.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.070
Approached me?

26:41.090 --> 26:42.100
What the...

26:43.160 --> 26:44.220
All right, look.

26:46.010 --> 26:47.180
Amara know about this?

26:47.200 --> 26:50.190
You going through my stuff
like the Gestapo?

26:50.210 --> 26:51.450
We just need to take care of...

26:52.010 --> 26:53.060
We're done. We're done.

26:54.170 --> 26:56.000
That's my underwear.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.620
That's right. Yeah.
Having fun with that?

26:59.190 --> 27:00.230
Okay.

27:03.090 --> 27:04.090
Amara!

27:05.150 --> 27:08.090
- Yes?
- I'm out of here.

27:08.110 --> 27:11.000
I thought you work here today.
Why do you leave?

27:11.020 --> 27:13.050
Well, I don't have to, but...

27:13.070 --> 27:16.010
There's a guy going through my
underwear drawer right now.

27:16.030 --> 27:18.210
Ed's in there. He's giving
me the third degree

27:18.230 --> 27:20.060
like I'm stealing silverware.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.120
Seriously? What?
I did something wrong?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.120
I don't know.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.010
Did you?

27:32.190 --> 27:36.120
You know what? A relationship,
it's based on twoway trust.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.130
It's like a canoe.

27:39.150 --> 27:41.080
If a person gets out,

27:41.100 --> 27:42.170
it flips.

27:42.190 --> 27:45.010
Or it goes in a circle
or something.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.060
I don't know.
What I'm saying is,

27:46.080 --> 27:48.210
if you're not gonna trust me,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.400
I don't know how
this is gonna work.

27:54.110 --> 27:57.130
Ed, tell Tony to get
out of the bedroom.

28:00.050 --> 28:01.220
These guys will be gone soon.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.040
You can work upstairs.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.110
Unless there's a reason
you don't want to stay.

28:10.070 --> 28:11.210
Sure.

28:11.230 --> 28:14.020
Okay. I'll be upstairs.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.210
Tammy said she let an electrician in
the office a couple of weeks ago.

28:26.230 --> 28:29.130
She thought we called him.

28:29.150 --> 28:31.090
You think she's
working with the Feds?

28:32.160 --> 28:33.230
We find out.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.220
How's it going?

28:48.160 --> 28:51.080
Turns out you can only watch something
three or four thousand times

28:51.100 --> 28:53.060
before you lose all perspective.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.030
I heard there was
a coffee incident.

28:58.050 --> 29:00.070
Yeah. That was unfortunate.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.070
The drives are running again.

29:03.090 --> 29:05.020
I just watched the last scene.

29:05.170 --> 29:06.230
It's good.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.020
But?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.130
You're focusing on
characters who are talking.

29:13.140 --> 29:15.040
Isn't that how it works?

29:15.060 --> 29:18.200
It's more interesting what
Fulton and Margaret can't say.

29:18.220 --> 29:20.230
So focus on the looks
between them.

29:28.180 --> 29:30.160
Do you want me to come?

29:30.180 --> 29:32.030
It's your fucking note.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.070
You was driving with
a fucking cane?

30:03.200 --> 30:06.050
Maybe you didn't hear, but

30:06.070 --> 30:08.130
I sustained nerve damage

30:08.150 --> 30:10.130
kinda getting shot.

30:10.150 --> 30:13.000
It'd be nice if you
got an automatic.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.200
- Well, let's go.
- I can't lift anything.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.210
- Doctor's orders.
- No, no, no.

30:20.230 --> 30:22.050
- Fuck that.
- No.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.160
Driver just drives.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.100
What the fuck?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.210
This is from movies.

30:51.230 --> 30:56.010
Whoever owns this house got a lot
of damn time on their hands.

30:56.030 --> 30:58.110
But, I mean,
it's worth money, right?

30:58.130 --> 31:00.210
Maybe if it's like
sports memorabilia.

31:00.230 --> 31:02.070
I bet this shit's
worth something.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.120
What are these movies?

31:07.060 --> 31:08.150
"The Maltese Falcon.

31:09.230 --> 31:11.170
Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

31:11.190 --> 31:13.130
Has anyone heard of this shit?

31:13.150 --> 31:14.150
It's old movies.

31:16.190 --> 31:18.110
Maybe that's good.

31:18.130 --> 31:20.120
I mean, it's like
antiques, right?

31:20.140 --> 31:21.180
Just load the van.

31:29.010 --> 31:30.100
Ricky!

31:31.170 --> 31:32.170
What?

31:34.040 --> 31:35.090
You sleep already?

31:36.160 --> 31:37.220
Long day.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.040
Just kind of took it out of me.

31:48.180 --> 31:50.040
Yes?

31:50.060 --> 31:51.030
We've been working\h
on the housekeeper.

31:51.050 --> 31:52.190
She's not with the Feds.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.020
Just made a mistake.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.180
Letting in the electrician?

31:56.170 --> 31:57.170
Yeah.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.150
You still want us
to... handle this?

32:02.210 --> 32:04.070
What do you think?

32:28.140 --> 32:29.150
Shit!

32:30.190 --> 32:31.190
What was that?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.200
It was the Maltese Falcon.

32:33.220 --> 32:35.110
From Star Wars?

32:35.130 --> 32:37.150
No, that's the Millennium
Falcon, \h pendejo.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.150
We can actually get
money for that.

32:39.170 --> 32:42.110
Hey, grab what you got
and let's go.

32:47.230 --> 32:50.090
Hey, are we done?

32:50.110 --> 32:52.000
We would be,
if you did anything.

32:58.030 --> 32:59.220
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.180
Sorry to call so late.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.210
Is this an okay time?

33:02.230 --> 33:05.080
I mean... Sure. Yeah.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.020
Thanks for the muffins.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.210
- You like them?
- They're yummy.

33:08.230 --> 33:11.080
I was confused by the note, which
said they're from my mother.

33:11.100 --> 33:13.040
That was to\h throw off Rick.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.130
You know, if he knew they were
from me, he might get suspicious.

33:15.150 --> 33:17.170
Just my mother died
when I was 15.

33:17.190 --> 33:18.210
Shit!

33:18.230 --> 33:20.010
It's weird to get
muffins from her.

33:20.030 --> 33:22.170
I'm sorry.\h - It's okay.

33:22.190 --> 33:26.100
There's stuff you don't know about me.
That's what we're dealing with.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.210
You know, and some guys, if
they got a girl pregnant

33:28.230 --> 33:30.020
after a night together,

33:30.040 --> 33:32.010
they wouldn't be
so nice about it.

33:32.030 --> 33:34.100
And you are, so thank you.

33:36.010 --> 33:39.180
Thank you for thanking me.

33:39.200 --> 33:42.170
- Night.
- Yeah. Okay., yeah. Night.

33:46.230 --> 33:48.080
Let's go.

33:50.030 --> 33:52.180
Hey, what about this?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.060
There's no room.

34:01.150 --> 34:02.210
I'm yours.

34:04.050 --> 34:05.160
And yours alone.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.060
Forever.

34:11.159 --> 34:14.159
You wait till you've got a foot out the
door, and then you give a good note.

34:14.179 --> 34:17.040
Just to irritate you.

34:17.210 --> 34:19.020
You're not leaving.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.
We've recut the entire film.

34:21.020 --> 34:22.780
Yeah, maybe I'll make
changes to the changes.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.050
No, we've gotta render edits,

34:24.070 --> 34:26.179
and we've worked
20 hours straight.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.100
All right, go on.
Get your beauty sleep.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.110
Tell Robert that when it's done,

34:31.130 --> 34:33.080
I want it to start
from the top again,

34:33.100 --> 34:35.050
- so I can take notes.
- Yeah, I'll tell him.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.060
You need some rest.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.199
Yeah, I can't fucking sleep.

34:40.219 --> 34:43.150
Look, from the bit I've seen,
you did great with this cut.

34:43.170 --> 34:46.230
At least, given what
you had to work with.

34:50.010 --> 34:51.230
You excited about the new gig?

34:52.010 --> 34:54.120
Nervous.

34:54.139 --> 34:57.000
I've been working my way up
at Gravity for years.

34:57.020 --> 34:59.120
This could be a mistake.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.110
I've actually been
reading this book.

35:01.130 --> 35:03.230
It's about getting lost
and finding your way out.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.110
It's called Wilderness.

35:06.210 --> 35:07.210
You should read it.

35:09.010 --> 35:10.040
Are you saying I'm lost?

35:10.060 --> 35:11.140
What? No.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.230
I am.

35:15.010 --> 35:17.190
I fucking am. I don't
know what I'm doing.

35:17.210 --> 35:20.070
I don't know if the movie
makes any sense.

35:20.090 --> 35:21.190
I don't know if it's any good.

35:21.210 --> 35:23.150
And if it's shite, I don't
think I can handle it.

35:28.180 --> 35:31.200
You know, when I first met you,

35:31.220 --> 35:35.090
I assumed you were
just some Irish conman.

35:38.060 --> 35:39.180
Turns out you're a producer.

35:40.230 --> 35:42.120
An excellent one.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.010
I'm sorry I'm leaving while you're in post.
It's really shitty timing.

35:50.030 --> 35:51.160
No, it's how it worked out.

35:52.060 --> 35:53.120
Right?

35:54.100 --> 35:56.040
Um... Thanks,

35:56.060 --> 35:58.090
you know, for everything.

35:58.110 --> 36:00.220
Yeah, it was
a good collaboration.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.200
You know, other than
when you blackmailed me.

36:03.220 --> 36:06.070
I nearly forgot about that.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.230
- Take care.
- Yeah.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.170
Hey.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.010
You all right?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.200
Hard to trust people
in my business.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.210
If I do and I'm wrong,

36:56.040 --> 36:57.120
that's it for me.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.150
So I'm gonna ask you.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.200
Can I trust you?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.010
Yeah.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.170
Yes.

37:21.060 --> 37:22.140
You can trust me.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.100
Okay.

38:07.140 --> 38:09.000
What time is it?

38:09.020 --> 38:12.110
Do you think this scene
could use different music?

38:14.060 --> 38:15.150
Did you sleep?

38:18.180 --> 38:20.230
- I'm gonna shut the door.
- Please do.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.100
Clean shirt.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.020
Amara is pulling up right now.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.170
Yeah, so, you know,
you might wanna get dressed.

38:32.190 --> 38:34.130
- Get me the editor.
- Right.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.160
So how was it seeing
the cut again?

38:42.180 --> 38:44.150
I didn't...
Didn't get through it.

38:45.190 --> 38:47.100
It'd be good to have
your take on it.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.060
Um...

38:50.080 --> 38:52.000
I can't stay for the screening.

38:52.140 --> 38:54.090
Really?

38:54.110 --> 38:57.170
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's my
first day at the new job.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.140
But I'll check back in later
to see how it went.

39:02.160 --> 39:05.140
Maybe tomorrow night
if I don't work too late?

39:05.160 --> 39:07.040
Don't trouble yourself.

39:14.070 --> 39:15.230
I'll see it as soon as I can.

39:19.210 --> 39:22.030
Maybe later this week
we can grab a drink?

39:22.050 --> 39:23.170
I'm sure you'll be busy

39:23.190 --> 39:25.210
with your new gig.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.170
Good luck with it, by the way.
Very exciting.

39:28.190 --> 39:30.170
Yeah.

39:31.170 --> 39:33.130
The big screening.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.040
Yes, it is.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.140
There he is.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.220
- Morning.
- You sleep much?

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Not funny.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.190
How you feel about it?

40:00.210 --> 40:02.110
You let me know what you think.

40:02.130 --> 40:03.210
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.070
- After you.
- No, I'm not gonna come in.

40:07.090 --> 40:08.330
Let me know when it's all over.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.190
Yo. You coming with me?

40:23.210 --> 40:25.050
You can handle it.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.130
Tia say anything?

40:31.130 --> 40:32.200
About how good we did?

40:32.220 --> 40:34.190
All that shit
bringing in revenue?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.220
Yeah, of course, she didn't.

40:38.220 --> 40:39.220
She did.

40:40.130 --> 40:41.110
Yeah, right.

40:41.130 --> 40:42.230
That's the address.

40:44.030 --> 40:46.040
Take him all
the movie memorabilia.

40:46.060 --> 40:48.050
Name is Moyseth.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.150
He's with the LA.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.070
With LA?

40:56.090 --> 40:58.000
They're gonna deduct it
from what we owe.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.020
No way!

41:00.020 --> 41:01.300
Does my Tia know
about this shit?

41:02.100 --> 41:03.160
It was her idea.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.160
Man! Fuck LA, man!

41:07.180 --> 41:10.010
If I was you,
I would go to the UHaul,

41:10.030 --> 41:11.060
get a dolly.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.190
Those boxes are heavy.

41:22.220 --> 41:25.000
They're... They're at the end.

41:31.150 --> 41:34.040
I'll never leave.\h
Not for anything.

41:35.070 --> 41:37.000
I'm yours,

41:37.200 --> 41:40.050
and yours alone.

41:40.070 --> 41:41.140
Forever.

41:43.150 --> 41:44.210
Get the lights.

41:50.070 --> 41:53.030
Fucking hallelujah!

41:55.080 --> 41:57.010
Hey...

41:57.030 --> 41:59.180
What you pulled off
right there, that's a...

41:59.200 --> 42:01.170
- A Christmas miracle.
- Yeah?

42:01.190 --> 42:03.100
I never, in a million years,

42:03.120 --> 42:04.130
did I think you'd get it
to there.

42:04.150 --> 42:05.220
Very impressive.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.190
- You think it's good?
- I think it's fine.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.140
- Fine?
- Yeah.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.210
Come on. You took a one, and you
turned it into a solid five.

42:18.090 --> 42:19.150
Out of fucking ten?

42:19.170 --> 42:21.060
- We can sell it?
- Are you kidding?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.180
I sell B movies.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.110
This... This is a totally
adequate midbudget drama.

42:25.130 --> 42:26.190
If we do promotion,

42:26.210 --> 42:28.180
there's no question it sells.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.180
But it's not

42:32.080 --> 42:33.100
good?

42:34.160 --> 42:36.000
It... It's good.

42:36.020 --> 42:38.020
It's got a lot of great scenes.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.030
It's better than so much
of what's out there.

42:40.050 --> 42:42.060
Is it gonna win an Oscar? No.

42:42.080 --> 42:45.000
But it's a totally
respectable...

42:46.170 --> 42:48.090
He's not getting
what I'm saying?

42:52.150 --> 42:55.030
Buddy! Hey, you did it.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.060
We're out of the woods.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.220
Miles!

43:03.130 --> 43:04.170
How'd you get all this?

43:05.090 --> 43:06.190
Went in and took it.

43:06.210 --> 43:10.080
Man! You got dresses and

43:11.170 --> 43:13.010
little ray guns.

43:13.230 --> 43:15.230
You some hard motherfuckers.

43:19.090 --> 43:20.160
I'm fucking with you.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.110
I know you real.

43:22.130 --> 43:24.080
Yeah, how's that?

43:24.100 --> 43:26.000
Amara's nephew, right?

43:26.020 --> 43:28.260
I saw you with some buddies
down at the Mai a while back.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.110
Blazing Clipper?

43:31.130 --> 43:34.030
Yeah, maybe you heard
what happened to them.

43:34.050 --> 43:36.090
They were here slinging in
LA, and they got dropped.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.090
By us?

43:41.110 --> 43:43.130
If we'd done that,
it's to send a message.

43:43.150 --> 43:45.170
Right? I would tell you.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.100
Maybe.

43:49.190 --> 43:51.190
I seem like I'm afraid of you?

43:53.230 --> 43:55.230
So why would I lie?

44:00.030 --> 44:01.210
Strawberry, watermelon.

44:04.030 --> 44:06.060
Edibles.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.160
Be careful though, man.
They strong, all right?

44:08.180 --> 44:11.010
Easy with that.

44:11.030 --> 44:12.630
How much do you think
this shit is worth?

44:13.150 --> 44:15.030
Couple hundred Gs.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.010
Yeah, right.

44:17.230 --> 44:19.050
Seriously?

44:19.070 --> 44:20.090
At least. Look.

44:20.110 --> 44:21.230
This right here, look.

44:22.220 --> 44:25.040
It's from Some Like It Hot.

44:25.060 --> 44:27.050
Marilyn Monroe. Yeah, man.

44:27.070 --> 44:29.030
This shit is worth bank.

44:30.150 --> 44:31.210
You did good.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.050
Hey.

44:49.200 --> 44:51.110
Is Miles okay?

44:51.130 --> 44:54.010
He didn't seem okay.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.030
Yeah.

45:01.110 --> 45:03.040
Um, so your...

45:05.030 --> 45:06.190
So your suggestion.

45:08.070 --> 45:09.020
Yeah?

45:09.040 --> 45:11.070
Is that we get married,

45:13.000 --> 45:16.150
so that the religious
restrictions are out of the way,

45:16.170 --> 45:19.150
and then we get to
know each other?

45:19.170 --> 45:20.210
Right.

45:22.070 --> 45:24.150
I mean, it would
have to be a secret,

45:24.170 --> 45:26.040
or else

45:26.060 --> 45:28.030
everyone will treat us like
we're really married.

45:28.050 --> 45:30.030
We don't tell anybody. No.

45:31.220 --> 45:34.100
I read online that
Mormons can't get divorced.

45:35.180 --> 45:37.100
You're not Mormon.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.000
So you can divorce me.

45:40.020 --> 45:41.340
There's nothing I can
do about it.

45:42.010 --> 45:44.180
I also read about some ceremony

45:44.200 --> 45:48.100
where they rub oil
all over your body.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.230
That's in temple.

45:51.010 --> 45:52.450
We can get married
at the courthouse.

45:53.010 --> 45:54.060
No wedding dress.

45:55.100 --> 45:57.030
Shit, you can wear those jeans.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.210
- Let's do it.
- Yeah?

46:05.230 --> 46:07.120
Great.

46:08.170 --> 46:10.080
Okay.

46:10.100 --> 46:13.190
We should work out
the details, because...

46:13.210 --> 46:15.110
The sooner the better, right?

46:15.130 --> 46:17.030
- Yeah, I'm open to...
- Tomorrow?

46:17.050 --> 46:19.000
Tomorrow. Yeah. Great.

46:19.020 --> 46:20.190
I'll call City Hall. Although I
don't think we need an appointment.

46:20.210 --> 46:22.100
Great, great.

46:27.050 --> 46:29.230
I should go. But I'll call
you later, and we'll just

46:30.010 --> 46:32.100
- work out the details.
- Yeah.

46:32.120 --> 46:33.220
Okay.

46:37.010 --> 46:38.070
Bye.

47:03.210 --> 47:05.170
Here you are.

47:05.190 --> 47:07.120
- Wesley.
- Hey, hey.

47:07.140 --> 47:11.040
I heard you got the movie into
Santa Barbara. That's great.

47:11.060 --> 47:13.170
You know what I'm excited about?

47:13.190 --> 47:14.210
Our film.

47:14.230 --> 47:16.050
Yeah, yeah.

47:16.070 --> 47:17.140
That's gonna be some
beautiful shit, man.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.230
It is. Have a seat.

47:19.010 --> 47:21.070
So you've got a list
of directors, is it?

47:21.090 --> 47:23.100
You tell me who you think
would be a good fit.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.220
Miles. Miles, do you
know Ellen Vernoff?

47:26.000 --> 47:27.150
Ellen Vernoff?

47:30.190 --> 47:33.130
Did she do that thing
with Christian Bale...

47:33.150 --> 47:35.010
No, she's not...
She's not a director.

47:35.030 --> 47:37.210
She was on a date
with Amy Adam's agent

47:37.230 --> 47:39.210
in that restaurant last week,

47:39.230 --> 47:41.010
where you had the altercation.

47:41.030 --> 47:42.100
We worked through all of that.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.150
She is Bruce Vernoff's daughter.

47:49.130 --> 47:53.040
Bruce Vernoff is
my boss' boss. Okay?

47:53.060 --> 47:54.220
She told him all about it.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.170
And she gave him your name.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.120
- So now you're caught in the middle of it?
- Yeah.

48:05.140 --> 48:06.150
Shit, I'm sorry.

48:06.170 --> 48:08.070
- Well...
- That's...

48:08.090 --> 48:09.230
You know what I'm gonna do?

48:10.010 --> 48:11.070
Give me his number,

48:11.090 --> 48:13.030
and I'll call him
and sort it out myself.

48:13.050 --> 48:16.020
- What was his name? Bruce?
- No. I... I can't.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.140
Okay. So, I'll...

48:20.160 --> 48:22.230
I'll call the niece.
That's even better.

48:23.010 --> 48:24.100
Actually more personal.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.190
Bruce Vernoff phoned me
today from Paris.

48:27.210 --> 48:30.120
I mean, he pulled me out of spin class,
I almost shit in my bike shorts.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.150
What I'm saying is,
you can't fix this.

48:35.170 --> 48:37.020
I can't even fix it.

48:43.030 --> 48:44.100
So?

48:45.220 --> 48:47.060
So you're off the movie.

48:51.140 --> 48:52.140
No, I'm not.

48:56.110 --> 48:58.040
I'm not off the fucking movie.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.170
Look, I'm doing
the right thing here.

48:59.190 --> 49:01.040
I called you and I wanted
to talk to you in person.

49:01.060 --> 49:03.040
Did I not get the script
to Amy Adams?

49:03.060 --> 49:04.110
- You did.
- Did I not do that?

49:04.130 --> 49:06.080
You told me to be persuasive.

49:06.100 --> 49:08.170
Yeah, like with your words.

49:08.190 --> 49:10.120
Is that what you meant, Wes?

49:13.090 --> 49:15.020
Are you frightened of me?

49:16.220 --> 49:18.030
You fucking should be.

49:18.050 --> 49:19.050
Jesus Christ!

49:19.070 --> 49:21.040
Calling me brother and pal!

49:21.060 --> 49:22.080
You gotta calm down.

49:22.100 --> 49:24.090
You smug fucking company boy.

49:24.110 --> 49:26.010
What are you telling her?

49:26.030 --> 49:28.020
Did he tell you to call someone?

49:28.040 --> 49:29.160
Put the phone down!

49:29.180 --> 49:32.070
Put the fucking phone down,
or I swear to God I'll...

50:00.140 --> 50:02.010
I'm gonna call
all the buyers I know

50:02.030 --> 50:04.070
and make sure
they're at that festival.

50:04.090 --> 50:06.060
We could get
a bidding war going.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.010
That's when you make big money.

50:08.030 --> 50:10.020
Ricky.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.140
You did good.

50:13.090 --> 50:15.130
Let's celebrate.

50:15.150 --> 50:17.170
- Champagne?
- Anything you like.

50:18.190 --> 50:20.130
Tammy.

50:20.150 --> 50:22.080
She don't work here no more.

50:26.030 --> 50:27.080
That's too bad.

50:28.070 --> 50:30.110
She made great pancakes.

50:30.130 --> 50:32.170
Bring the champagne
to the bedroom.

50:36.230 --> 50:38.090
Okay.

50:39.305 --> 50:45.383
