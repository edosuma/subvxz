WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.887
-I'm here to take you home.
-Move!

00:19.920 --> 00:21.122
I can't do that.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.194
What's going on?

00:26.227 --> 00:27.895
I've been getting the headaches
since Andy left.

00:27.928 --> 00:31.065
When I touch things,
they begin crumbling.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.533
You're with the Purifiers?
I don't think

00:32.566 --> 00:34.335
-I'm down to join a...
-WILSON: Hate group?

00:34.368 --> 00:35.736
JACE:
The mutants that escaped

00:35.769 --> 00:37.671
from the mental hospital
are dangerous. Show everybody

00:37.705 --> 00:40.074
that the Purifiers
are part of the solution.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.910
GUARD: Come on,
the doc's ready for you.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.920
(beep, click)

01:00.461 --> 01:02.163
(collar beeps)

01:04.265 --> 01:05.466
(beeps)

01:08.269 --> 01:09.770
(beeps)

01:12.340 --> 01:14.675
Time for another exercise,
girls.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.578
(beeps)

01:23.484 --> 01:25.453
This is a bad man

01:25.486 --> 01:27.488
with a secret.
I need you

01:27.521 --> 01:30.591
to look inside his mind
and tell me what it is.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.763
Don't make me ask twice, girls.

01:38.332 --> 01:42.336
(Frost sisters whispering
indistinctly)

01:42.370 --> 01:43.937
Please don't.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.440
He's scared.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.809
-He thinks you'll find
his family.
-And hurt them,

01:48.842 --> 01:51.579
-because they're mutants.
-DOCTOR: Dig deeper.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.314
Tell me where they are.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.082
ESME: He doesn't want
to think about it.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.285
He doesn't want us to know.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.788
Then work together,
just like we talked about.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.292
Three minds in one.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.695
(Frost sisters whispering
indistinctly)

02:07.728 --> 02:09.230
(groaning)

02:10.698 --> 02:12.833
ESME (crying):
Please don't make us.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.035
He's so scared for his family.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.037
You know the rules, Esme.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.341
Do you care about his family...

02:20.374 --> 02:21.809
or yours?

02:29.183 --> 02:32.052
(Frost sisters whispering
indistinctly)

02:32.085 --> 02:33.721
(grunts)

02:33.754 --> 02:35.289
(screams)

02:35.323 --> 02:36.690
Please! Please don't!

02:36.724 --> 02:38.392
They'll kill them!

02:38.426 --> 02:39.860
(man screams)

02:50.438 --> 02:53.707
*

02:53.741 --> 02:54.808
(grunting)

02:54.842 --> 02:57.044
(screams)

03:00.414 --> 03:01.949
(both laughing)

03:11.692 --> 03:13.227
(Twist chuckles)

03:15.062 --> 03:17.265
(Polaris humming lullaby)

03:23.203 --> 03:24.238
(knocking)

03:24.272 --> 03:25.273
(door opens)

03:25.306 --> 03:27.375
Hey. Sorry, they, uh...

03:27.408 --> 03:29.777
they need us in training,
like, now.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.945
What, again?
We're training again?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.415
Yeah. It's just
what the Frosts said.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.585
(sighs) They've had us running
through crazy simulations

03:37.618 --> 03:39.219
nonstop all week.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.888
What is it this time?

03:40.921 --> 03:44.057
Attacking a armored
personnel carrier?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.926
A citywide chase?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.861
I heard something
about a SWAT team, actually.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.430
Unreal.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.766
This just keeps getting
better and better.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.968
I think Reeva just wants to
prepare us for the next mission.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.904
And where's she been lately?

03:56.937 --> 03:58.872
She even in the building?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.208
You know how she is.
Out doing important stuff.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.943
Never talks about it.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.647
Yeah, well, she better start.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.250
So, does-does that mean
you're coming, or...?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.185
'Cause Rebecca's
already down there.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.324
Yes, I'll be there in a minute.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.191
Okay.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.296
Oh.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.732
I'm sorry, baby girl.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.634
Mama's got to work.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.635
(Dawn coos)

04:27.668 --> 04:28.836
Yeah.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.673
Hmm?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.642
What about this one?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.511
(exhales)

04:37.545 --> 04:39.146
Everything has
to have sleeves now.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.486
Ugh. I can't believe we have
to wear last season's look

04:45.519 --> 04:48.789
because you let
that human flashlight grab you.

04:50.358 --> 04:53.293
(beeping)

04:53.327 --> 04:55.896
FEMALE VOICE:
Hologram simulation active.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.803
MAN:
Open fire!

05:02.836 --> 05:03.671
(gunfire)

05:08.742 --> 05:10.378
Get 'em!

05:23.857 --> 05:25.793
(one person clapping)

05:25.826 --> 05:27.861
Brava.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.664
-(sighs) Still needs work.
-I can do better.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.666
I was slow with those guys
at the end there.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.735
No, you were awesome.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.836
Look who breezed in.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.705
Is there something wrong, Lorna?

05:37.738 --> 05:40.374
You tell me. We're training
for some mystery job

05:40.408 --> 05:41.975
by playing
SWAT team Whac-A-Mole

05:42.009 --> 05:43.677
with a bunch of holograms?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.813
REEVA:
No need to be upset.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.048
These are just
worst-case scenarios.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.017
Last time we went out in the
field, we nearly got ambushed

05:50.050 --> 05:51.552
by the Mutant Underground,
and now we're, what,

05:51.585 --> 05:54.054
preparing to take fire
from all sides?

05:54.087 --> 05:56.056
What the hell kind of mission
is this?

05:56.089 --> 05:57.925
An important one.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.595
Well, here's something
that's important to me.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.996
My baby,

06:03.030 --> 06:04.264
who I've barely seen in two days

06:04.297 --> 06:06.033
because of all of this training,

06:06.066 --> 06:09.503
who may notice if Mommy comes
home riddled with bullets.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.238
I need to know the actual plan.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.074
You'll know when you need
to know. Trust me.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.576
We're all on the same side here,
Lorna.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.944
Are we?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.780
I'll make this real simple
for you.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.616
Either tell me what this little
operation is or I'm out.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.822
(scoffs)

06:36.464 --> 06:40.233
CAITLIN: I don't see any more
signs of a concussion.

06:40.267 --> 06:45.105
I am gonna go out on a limb
and pronounce you

06:45.138 --> 06:47.107
-recovered.
-Thanks.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.709
How's Dr. Kelsey?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.377
It was a close call.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.981
He'll be better by the time
the clinic reopens.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.383
He's a bit rattled.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.651
I can imagine.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.253
On the bright side,

07:00.287 --> 07:03.256
I was able to track down
the psychiatrist

07:03.290 --> 07:04.892
that worked
at that mental institution

07:04.925 --> 07:06.426
where you saw Andy.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.229
I made us an appointment
for tomorrow.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.665
-You really think
that's a good idea?
-Yeah.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.901
She worked at that hospital
that locked up mutants.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.435
Yeah, well, apparently,

07:15.469 --> 07:17.137
she felt bad about
the way they were treated,

07:17.170 --> 07:19.406
so she might be willing to give
us some information

07:19.439 --> 07:21.108
on that girl
that Andy broke out.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.275
And if she won't?

07:22.309 --> 07:24.244
Hey, we have to try.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.247
If we can find out why they
wanted that girl, Rebecca,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.449
we are one step closer to Andy.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.193
You sure you're gonna be okay
without me tomorrow?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.929
I still think I should go.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.531
Reed, you need to train.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.199
We have to get your powers
under control.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.135
The-the anxiety meds
aren't working

07:48.168 --> 07:50.504
and the side effects
are getting worse.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.439
-Can't we just change the dose?
-Honey.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.808
I know you want this
to just go away,

07:54.842 --> 07:58.579
but you have to deal with it,
not just drug it.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.850
It's so difficult to explain.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.219
When it happens, I-I feel
like I'm drowning.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.188
Just like...

08:08.221 --> 08:10.991
Like what?

08:11.024 --> 08:15.062
It's like when I got sick
when I was a kid.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.499
-When my dad made me sick.
-Hey.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.672
It's like everything's happening
at once.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.643
CAITLIN:
Just let John help you.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.144
I don't see how training
can help.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.512
It's just something
that happens.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.081
Just try.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.351
I remember you at law school.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.589
You were good at learning
new things.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.691
(scoffs)

08:45.859 --> 08:49.697
You're pretty damn good
at anything when you want to be.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.936
You've always made me feel
like I can do anything.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.105
You can.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.551
(indistinct chatter)

09:13.253 --> 09:15.188
WILSON:
You all remember Turner, here.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.592
It was thanks to him we hit
that mutie clinic last week.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.260
And he's been doing
a real good job

09:20.293 --> 09:22.529
on some of the patient files
we found there.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.231
Jace.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.069
According to the files,
they were sending a lot

09:29.102 --> 09:31.104
of their patients to a hospital
up in Baltimore,

09:31.138 --> 09:33.774
but it turns out, some of 'em
never showed up.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.043
The ones with arrest warrants.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.444
You thinking Mutant Underground?

09:37.477 --> 09:39.279
Who else can make mutant
fugitives disappear?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.448
There's a station up there,
I guarantee it.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.650
-Now...
-RAY: Yeah, so let's haul ass

09:42.683 --> 09:44.718
up to Baltimore
and start shaking them trees.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.887
-(indistinct chatter)
-KYLE: Boom.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.255
JACE:
Just listen up for a second.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.158
Please. We need
to be smart about this.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.827
These terrorists have stayed
ahead of the Sentinel Services

09:53.861 --> 09:55.295
because they work the system.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.997
They use our own society
against us.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.666
Court orders, warrants.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.900
One of them scurries
into a church,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.168
suddenly they're untouchable.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.503
Now, we don't have those rules.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.473
We can flush 'em out,
run 'em to ground, tie 'em up

10:06.506 --> 10:08.108
in a neat little bow
for the feds to collect.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.110
So we just start doing
their jobs for 'em?

10:10.143 --> 10:12.680
(murmuring)

10:12.713 --> 10:14.481
JACE:
Let me ask you something,

10:14.514 --> 10:16.516
guy who brings a .50-cal
to a meeting.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.484
Why are you here?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.620
Why are you all here?

10:20.654 --> 10:22.189
'Cause I think it's for the same
reason that I'm here.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.691
You want to make your
neighborhood safe again, right?

10:23.724 --> 10:26.159
And I'd say that most people
agree with you.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.028
But guess what.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.430
Mr. and Mrs. PTA
don't want to be

10:30.463 --> 10:32.365
on the same side
as a hate group.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.034
And if you keep running around,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.036
waving your guns,
beating up doctors,

10:36.069 --> 10:37.971
that is exactly
how people see you.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.608
They see you as a hate group,
but if you do this right,

10:41.641 --> 10:43.176
they'll come running
to your cause.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.045
Did I miss the part
where we put you in charge?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.848
Hey! Settle down.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.216
Here's how it's gonna be:

10:49.249 --> 10:50.650
I've talked to leadership.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.152
They want results.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.121
We're gonna give this plan
a shot.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.623
On my orders.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.725
We clear?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.293
Truth is,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.029
it's time somebody solved
the mutant problem.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.230
(murmuring)

11:03.263 --> 11:05.465
And it's going to be us.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.034
(applause)

11:15.075 --> 11:17.577
ANDY:
I was hoping you'd come.

11:17.610 --> 11:21.715
LAUREN:
Andy, what is this place?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.483
ANDY:
This is where we train.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.085
LAUREN:
You could have killed me.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.387
ANDY:
I know. I'm sorry,

11:27.420 --> 11:28.856
but I did warn you.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.023
Just don't get in my way again,
okay?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.258
This isn't you.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.693
How could you hurt
your own family?

11:33.727 --> 11:34.995
This is my family now.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.830
And they're making me stronger.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.298
-They could make you
stronger, too.
-Don't.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.603
This doesn't have to be a war.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.939
Aren't you sick of running?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.841
The Inner Circle
is helping people.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.242
So are we.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.344
Do you really think that getting
a few mutants

11:51.378 --> 11:53.046
to Mexico is helping?

11:53.080 --> 11:56.750
Lauren, we can do things
that you can't imagine.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.723
*

12:30.784 --> 12:32.920
(alarm chirps)

12:32.953 --> 12:34.321
I thought you said
you could handle

12:34.354 --> 12:35.655
training the team
while I was away.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.290
PHOEBE:
We're sorry.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.426
You knew how volatile Polaris
was when you recruited her.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.831
ESME: I believe you said
we "needed her spirit."

12:43.864 --> 12:46.599
Don't worry, we can bring her
back into the fold.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.269
She's used to being a leader
in the Underground.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.071
She doesn't like being left
in the dark.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.172
None of us do.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.606
I manage information

12:53.640 --> 12:55.308
to protect all of us.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.609
ESME:
Of course.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.078
But giving Lorna
a piece of the puzzle

12:58.111 --> 12:59.346
isn't gonna threaten
the whole picture.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.248
We asked her to join us.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
And believe in our cause.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.918
ESME:
It seems we have a choice.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.821
Trust her or lose her.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.389
(sighs)

13:12.792 --> 13:16.196
Fine. I have business I need
to take care of, so handle this.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.965
Of course.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.133
You can count on us.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.169
REEVA:
And, girls...

13:23.536 --> 13:24.905
Don't make me regret it.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.581
(phone beeps)

13:37.717 --> 13:39.719
I'm on my way.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.122
Is everything arranged
on your end?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.892
Good, because if anything
goes wrong,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.527
suffice it to say
that the fallout from me

13:47.560 --> 13:50.597
will be nothing compared
to the consequences for you.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.001
-(Dawn crying)
-POLARIS: It's okay.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.502
It's okay.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.638
Mama's sorry
she hasn't been around much.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.573
-(Dawn crying)
-(shushing)

14:06.947 --> 14:08.548
Shh.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.651
(Esme shushing)

14:11.684 --> 14:13.686
(laughs softly)

14:15.455 --> 14:17.324
(sighs)

14:17.357 --> 14:19.259
(exhales)

14:22.229 --> 14:23.230
(knocks)

14:23.263 --> 14:24.331
Yeah, shh.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.733
I finally got her to sleep.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.369
She was screaming all morning.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.004
We talked to Reeva.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.839
I told you,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.108
I'm not running blindfolded
into a slaughter.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.444
And we're not asking you to.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.112
We want to tell you the plan.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.547
Really?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.249
We have maps, route plans,

14:42.282 --> 14:44.184
-blueprints of the target.
-When things go sideways,

14:44.217 --> 14:47.554
blueprints are almost as useful
as to-do lists.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.590
Look, I need to go there,
in person, to see it for myself.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.060
I need to know what I'm risking
my life for.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.962
Okay? I owe it to her.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.399
ESME:
Hmm.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.571
All right, then.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.573
We'll go.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.980
Up till now, your powers
have manifested accidentally,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.414
under stress.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.416
When your emotions
are out of control,

15:16.449 --> 15:17.650
your powers are out of control.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.452
I'm not out of control.
I'm fine.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.254
All right. Show me. Here.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.925
Just... relax.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.728
-(sighs)
-Close your eyes and breathe.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.563
How do you feel?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.166
I feel like a guy
with his hand on a radiator.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.867
Try and dig a bit deeper.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.974
Can't you just show me
the technique?

15:41.008 --> 15:43.143
Th-There's no one technique.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.844
All right,
activating your powers,

15:44.877 --> 15:48.448
it starts with what's going on
with you internally.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.850
Okay,

15:50.883 --> 15:52.852
try this.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.822
Focus on a time
your powers manifested.

15:55.855 --> 16:00.293
How you felt when you crashed
the car with Lauren.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.529
-Dad!
-(tires screech)

16:10.237 --> 16:12.205
(exhales)
Nothing's happening.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.774
Reed, I can hear your heartbeat.
It's not even elevated.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.277
I get it, Reed.
You want a shortcut, don't you?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.646
You want to make up
30 years of experience

16:19.679 --> 16:21.314
in one afternoon
without doing any work.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.716
But to get a handle on this,
you have to face your fears.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.685
I know you're scared
to think about memories

16:25.718 --> 16:27.687
-that are too painful.
-That is not true.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.622
Okay, you have another excuse
for me? You have another reason

16:29.656 --> 16:31.191
-why you think you're special?
-(heart beating rapidly)

16:34.394 --> 16:36.996
So you gonna tell me
you're in control right now?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.031
(door opens)

16:38.065 --> 16:39.832
Guys,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.034
you got to see this.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.502
Shatter called.
He just sent this.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.904
Purifiers bombed
a sanctuary church in Baltimore.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.239
-My God.
-They're bombing churches now.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.575
I mean, that's a crazy big step,
even for them.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.243
Yeah, they got a big group of
refugees who've lost everything

16:50.277 --> 16:51.378
and no way to move 'em.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.046
Shatter's gonna take in
as many as he can

16:53.080 --> 16:55.482
at the Baltimore station,
but he needs our help.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.484
They need IDs, cars, the works.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.551
Yeah, well,
I checked police scanners.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.819
The cops are out in full force.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.054
It's not a good time to move.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.189
Yeah.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.590
That's why we have to go.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.492
We have to show them
we're still here.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.194
We have to stand together

17:07.227 --> 17:09.262
with the Mutant Underground,
especially now.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.205
*

17:23.543 --> 17:25.011
It's too bad this is

17:25.044 --> 17:27.614
what it takes to get
your ugly mugs up here.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.616
Shatter, good to see you, too.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.018
-Good to see you.
-So, what's the situation?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.521
We got about 20 refugees
from the bombed church.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.289
They've been filtering in
all day. And we already got

17:36.323 --> 17:38.024
a full house to begin with.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.127
Things have gotten worse
ever since that hospital attack

17:40.160 --> 17:41.894
-last week.
-ECLIPSE: Uh, great.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.896
The Inner Circle makes the
mess-- we get to clean it up.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.298
Oh, it's worse than that.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.400
The human groups
that used to help us,

17:47.434 --> 17:48.601
they won't even take our calls.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.740
We need to get the names
of the people who came in

17:53.773 --> 17:55.608
and start making some new IDs.
I'll get my equipment.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.576
We'll get on the names.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.916
-You sure
you're okay to do this?
-Why?

18:03.950 --> 18:05.718
-You think I'm gonna explode?
-Reed, you disintegrated

18:05.752 --> 18:07.720
a cast-iron radiator earlier.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.789
REED:
I was just... overwhelmed.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.224
Look, I'm strong enough
to keep it together

18:11.258 --> 18:12.725
while I make some IDs.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.427
Reed, it's not
about being strong.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.895
You're not gonna know
what's gonna set you off

18:15.928 --> 18:17.230
until you deal
with the fear and the anger

18:17.264 --> 18:18.931
-that's triggering this.
-You don't know anything

18:18.965 --> 18:21.234
-about what I'm feeling.
-No, but you do.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.236
And you need to own
those feelings

18:23.270 --> 18:25.738
or you'll never have control
of this.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.140
When your father suppressed
your X-Gene,

18:27.174 --> 18:28.575
he also robbed you of the chance

18:28.608 --> 18:30.109
to work through this
when you should have.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.811
John, I appreciate it,
but I'll work through it

18:31.844 --> 18:33.446
in my way.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.385
(indistinct chatter)

18:45.124 --> 18:47.860
We got all the personal
information we could.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.597
Lots of these folks
have been living

18:50.630 --> 18:52.999
in shelters and churches
for a while now.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.134
Should be enough.
Let me see.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.104
I heard a little of what
you was talking about with John.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.174
-Yeah, well, that's not...
-Uh, no, just hear me out.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.843
You know how I found out
I was a mutant?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.478
I went to sleep one day

19:05.512 --> 19:07.380
a normal kid,

19:07.414 --> 19:09.616
and I woke up looking like this,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.818
and everything I touched
was turning to crystal.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.820
It was terrifying.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.655
When I looked in that mirror,

19:15.688 --> 19:17.524
I saw a monster.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.726
So...

19:19.759 --> 19:22.229
I tried to kill it.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.131
I didn't put out the lights,
but...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.800
I cracked the windows a bit.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.002
I guess, sometimes,
the more you...

19:30.036 --> 19:32.739
reject the things
you can't face,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.207
the worse you make it.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.685
Here you go.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.191
Ugh, chamomile. Really?

19:52.225 --> 19:55.094
Well, if you're gonna be a yoga
mom, you got to look the part.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.231
You wanted to see the target.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.799
There it is.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.239
A bank?

20:06.273 --> 20:07.740
It's not just a bank.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.342
They've got
a mutant detection system.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.778
We can't get close
without setting off alarms.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.780
Now I get why Reeva
was having us train

20:13.813 --> 20:15.882
-to take fire from all sides.
-Lorna,

20:15.915 --> 20:18.184
this place was built
on mutant suffering.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.621
Creed Financial started funding
mutant slavery in the '50s

20:21.654 --> 20:23.290
in South America.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.058
They pushed through anti-mutant
legislation in the '70s,

20:26.092 --> 20:27.860
for slumlords in mutant ghettos.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.763
And they spent the '90s
creating the Kick epidemic.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.533
They've got their hands
in everything,

20:33.566 --> 20:35.868
even local Purifier chapters.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.104
But this, this is
exactly the kind of thing

20:38.137 --> 20:39.706
you joined the Inner Circle for.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.374
With all of Reeva's secrets,

20:41.408 --> 20:43.743
how am I supposed to know
what anything's for?

20:43.776 --> 20:45.645
You saw what happened
after we hit the hospital.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.715
Hundreds of mutants
took to the streets.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.484
We hit this place,
maybe thousands.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.854
We'll inspire an army.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.126
All right, look...

21:00.159 --> 21:01.894
this one...

21:01.928 --> 21:03.496
it's not just a cause.

21:05.164 --> 21:06.433
It's personal.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.000
For me

21:08.034 --> 21:09.569
and my sisters.

21:09.602 --> 21:13.940
Creed Financial funded the lab
that created us.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.408
Created you?

21:15.442 --> 21:19.412
My sisters and I...

21:19.446 --> 21:21.080
we're clones.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.915
(man screaming)

21:22.949 --> 21:25.184
They made us do
terrible things.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.587
For years, it went on,
until we couldn't

21:27.620 --> 21:29.155
take it anymore.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.659
We stopped the guards before
they could put the collars on.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.861
(Frost sisters whispering
indistinctly)

21:34.894 --> 21:36.463
And we did what we had to do.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.799
Fire. Fire. Fi-Fire. Fire.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.673
(Frost sisters whispering
indistinctly)

21:46.706 --> 21:48.207
We were 13 years old.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.376
Fire.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.144
We got out.

21:52.178 --> 21:55.382
But we didn't escape
what they did to us,

21:55.415 --> 21:58.751
the things they made us do.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.822
I know it's a risk, Lorna,

22:02.855 --> 22:06.693
but some risks are worth taking.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.370
REED:
I think we have a problem.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.371
THUNDERBIRD:
What is it?

22:18.405 --> 22:20.373
REED:
I spoke to a bunch of refugees

22:20.407 --> 22:21.841
from the church
about what happened.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.510
None of them were injured.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.478
Isn't that a good thing?

22:25.512 --> 22:28.180
Does seem kind of strange.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.385
If a bunch of Purifiers bomb
a church to hurt mutants,

22:32.419 --> 22:34.353
why were none of them hurt?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.989
Because it's a trap.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.091
We have to get everyone
out of here now.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.326
I'll go get people
from the back now.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.094
-Go, go.
-Too late.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.930
(tires screeching)

22:49.068 --> 22:51.070
They're here.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.744
(car doors closing)

22:57.777 --> 22:59.646
MAN:
Come on, let's do this.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.217
We have you surrounded.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.754
Anyone in the Mutant Underground

23:07.787 --> 23:09.522
who wishes to surrender
will not be harmed.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.224
You'll be handed over
to the proper authorities.

23:12.258 --> 23:14.427
They don't seem disposed
to surrender.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.763
They might.
Just... give it a few minutes.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.799
-I say we storm the castle.
-We're not... we're not

23:19.832 --> 23:22.401
storming anything.
We're not here for blood.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.437
We're here for justice.
Calm down.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.105
WILSON: What's next, Jace?
Trigger fingers

23:26.138 --> 23:27.106
are getting awfully itchy
around here.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.475
Does it really matter

23:28.508 --> 23:30.409
if we smoke 'em out
or just smoke 'em?

23:30.443 --> 23:32.912
Yes, it matters!

23:32.945 --> 23:35.381
Listen up and listen good.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.250
The terrorists and the killers
are inside, not out here.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.891
(sighs)

23:44.924 --> 23:46.459
We're the good guys here.

23:46.493 --> 23:49.161
Remember that.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.568
ESME: So, I do need
to talk to Reeva, but...

23:55.602 --> 23:57.269
we can count on you?

23:57.303 --> 24:00.673
Still want to look over
the attack plan, but I'm in.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.175
You were right, you know.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.845
If we're gonna do this,
we need to trust each other.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.914
I'm glad we did this.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.449
Me, too.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.919
But don't ever make me drink
chamomile again.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.153
(laughs)

24:15.788 --> 24:18.124
(humming lullaby)

24:23.195 --> 24:25.264
(elevator bell dings)

24:25.297 --> 24:27.199
(elevator doors open)

24:36.976 --> 24:39.478
Where did you hear that song?

24:39.512 --> 24:42.148
Uh, I don't know.

24:42.181 --> 24:44.316
Just something
that got stuck in my head.

24:44.350 --> 24:45.685
Probably from some old movie.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.486
I don't think so.

24:47.520 --> 24:51.858
That's the lullaby
I sing to my baby.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.961
Oh, well, I, um...
I must've overheard it.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.963
My aunt sang it to me
when I was a kid.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.397
She learned it from my mom.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.232
It's all I have from her.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.670
I only sing it to Dawn
when we're alone.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.207
Were you in my baby's head?

25:08.240 --> 25:10.009
Lorna,
what are you talking about?

25:10.042 --> 25:11.811
Answer me. When Dawn stopped
crying earlier,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.212
was that you in her head?

25:13.245 --> 25:14.881
No, I-I would never
do something...

25:14.914 --> 25:17.516
-Don't lie to me!
-Uh, I didn't mean any harm.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.218
She-she was upset, and I...

25:19.251 --> 25:20.753
-(gasping)
-Is this your idea of trust?

25:20.787 --> 25:22.989
Is anything you tell me
even real?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.592
Please, y-you...
you don't understand.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.493
No, I understand. Nothing

25:27.526 --> 25:29.662
-you say is real.
-(gasping)

25:29.696 --> 25:30.997
Please, Lorna,

25:31.030 --> 25:32.599
-I can't breathe.
-(elevator bell dings)

25:32.632 --> 25:35.167
(Esme gasping)

25:35.201 --> 25:37.904
If you or your sisters so much

25:37.937 --> 25:42.809
as look at my daughter again,
I will kill you.

25:44.911 --> 25:45.878
(groans)

25:45.912 --> 25:48.414
(singing high tone)

25:48.447 --> 25:51.517
(Esme coughing)

25:51.550 --> 25:54.086
-(panting)
-REEVA: Sorry.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.088
I couldn't let you do something
you'd regret.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.227
Just keep your monsters away
from me and my daughter.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.264
Esme, are you okay?

26:06.332 --> 26:09.869
(gasps)

26:09.902 --> 26:11.638
CAITLIN: Dr. Taylor's office
is just up here.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.239
Listen.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.807
I want to talk to you
about what happened

26:14.841 --> 26:16.075
with you and Andy
at the hospital.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.877
I feel like

26:17.910 --> 26:19.979
I pressured you to face him
when you weren't ready.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.981
I keep telling you, Mom...

26:22.014 --> 26:24.050
that wasn't your fault.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.754
I just can't let go of the idea
that we can get through to him.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.322
We had another dream last night.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.927
You really think
he's having these dreams, too?

26:34.961 --> 26:36.428
I know he is.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.331
You wouldn't recognize him.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.800
He's different.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.601
He's gotten so much stronger.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.503
I've been talking to John.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.106
Andy getting stronger
isn't unusual.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.910
Powers develop and-and change.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.647
-Yours might, too.
-And then what?

26:54.681 --> 26:56.082
Fight Andy again?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.817
Hopefully,
it-it doesn't come to that.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.451
He-he may come home when he...

26:59.485 --> 27:01.520
-He's not coming home.
-Well, when he realizes

27:01.553 --> 27:02.955
-what he's doing is wrong...
-You still don't get it.

27:04.556 --> 27:06.659
Andy doesn't want to be saved.

27:06.693 --> 27:09.261
He believes the Inner Circle
is helping people.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.663
Mutants are calling them heroes.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.567
Maybe he's right.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.507
Maybe we're the ones
that need to be saved.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.776
CAITLIN:
Thank you so much for seeing us

27:23.810 --> 27:25.778
on such short notice,
Dr. Taylor.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.780
Of course.

27:27.814 --> 27:31.684
It's such a tragedy,
what happened at the hospital.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.119
Tea?

27:33.152 --> 27:35.554
Uh, sure.

27:35.587 --> 27:38.624
Now, which patient
were you here about?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.392
I don't think you mentioned.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.662
Um, we were hoping
you could tell us what happened

27:43.696 --> 27:47.566
to our cousin, a-a young woman,
her name's Rebecca Hoover.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.069
She's... your cousin?

27:50.102 --> 27:51.070
(teakettle clinking)

27:51.103 --> 27:53.472
Uh, yes, um...

27:53.505 --> 27:55.474
we haven't been close

27:55.507 --> 27:57.376
with that side of the family
for a while.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.078
LAUREN:
It's just... now that we know

27:59.111 --> 28:00.847
that the X-Gene is
in our bloodline,

28:00.880 --> 28:04.216
we thought we should get
to know more about her, maybe

28:04.250 --> 28:05.818
what she can do.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.386
I, uh...

28:07.419 --> 28:09.688
I'll tell you what I can.

28:09.722 --> 28:13.059
I haven't worked at the hospital
for a while, of course.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.095
Yes, and-and why did you leave,
exactly?

28:16.128 --> 28:19.398
I had issues with the treatment
of some of the patients.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.001
Any time people are committed
against their will,

28:22.034 --> 28:24.003
it's a difficult situation.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.371
Mm.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.875
Why don't I go get my notes?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.412
-(door opens)
-(Caitlin sighs)

28:33.445 --> 28:35.281
Something's wrong.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.416
Lauren, I know
you don't like this...

28:37.449 --> 28:39.618
No, it's not that.
She's scared.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.088
-Why would she be scared?
-I don't know.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.389
Hey, Lauren.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.557
Yes, please, I need help.

28:45.591 --> 28:48.394
-(door bangs open)
-(Dr. Taylor gasping)

28:51.263 --> 28:54.767
-(crying)
-Now let's try this again.

28:54.801 --> 28:57.937
Tell me... about Rebecca Hoover.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.912
-Please, what do you want?
-We just need information.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.379
(crying):
I can't talk about my patients.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.547
LAUREN:
Patients?

29:08.580 --> 29:11.383
You tortured those people.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.619
I treated them as best
as I could.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.788
Locking them in cages
like animals!

29:15.822 --> 29:17.489
Hey, I know
you did the best you could.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.392
I spoke to one of your patients.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.761
Michael. Do you remember him?

29:22.795 --> 29:25.497
He said you were kind to him.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.900
That's why we came to you.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.969
I tried,

29:30.002 --> 29:32.504
but it wasn't up to me.

29:32.538 --> 29:35.842
-I should have done more.
-Then help us now.

29:35.875 --> 29:39.411
Michael said you felt bad
about how they treated Rebecca,

29:39.445 --> 29:41.814
that she was abused
and-and locked up.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.250
Some very dangerous people
took her,

29:44.283 --> 29:45.985
and we need to find out why.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.322
Because they also have my son.

29:50.356 --> 29:53.960
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.227
What?

29:57.396 --> 30:00.066
I need to show you something.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.838
We recorded all of our patient
sessions at the hospital.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.539
We had to drug her.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.109
Otherwise, she could just
turn her collar inside out.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.178
The cops found that out
the hard way.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.713
She has the ability
to twist things.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.683
A sort of dimensional
manipulation.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.651
This was after she first came.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.787
We thought she was on her meds.
We were wrong.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.156
(screaming)

30:24.190 --> 30:26.092
(gasps)

30:27.994 --> 30:30.629
I quit the hospital
the same day.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.831
The autopsy said

30:32.865 --> 30:34.700
she turned them inside out.

30:34.733 --> 30:36.702
Oh, God.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.671
That's how I knew
you weren't Rebecca's family.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.542
That's how she killed them, too.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.486
PHOEBE:
Talk about amateur hour.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.322
Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.990
You started having feelings
all over the place

30:58.024 --> 30:59.691
and let your guard down.

30:59.725 --> 31:01.727
-I did what I had
to do to convince her.
-Yeah.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.195
-She looked really convinced.
-REEVA: I believe

31:03.229 --> 31:05.664
the last thing I said to you was
"Don't make me regret it."

31:05.697 --> 31:07.033
Don't worry.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.467
We broke it, we'll...

31:09.801 --> 31:11.570
-Fix it.
-We can't afford

31:11.603 --> 31:13.239
to make any more mistakes.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.174
We need Lorna
for this plan to work,

31:15.207 --> 31:16.875
and we need her by tomorrow.

31:16.909 --> 31:20.579
Well, we'll just have to use
a more... direct approach.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.349
We can't control Lorna
like that, not forever.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.683
SOPHIE:
Between the three of us,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.685
we can do it long enough
to fix your mistake.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.087
Controlling people's minds

31:28.120 --> 31:29.956
can't be the solution
to everything.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.857
Esme, that's what we do.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.625
That's what we are.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.063
No, that's what he wanted us
to be.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.971
You said
we're building a new world.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.772
But if we're gonna build
something lasting,

31:46.805 --> 31:48.474
something real,

31:48.507 --> 31:52.911
then people need to believe,
especially Lorna.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.419
I admire your passion, Esme,

32:00.452 --> 32:02.388
but we can't afford
to get sentimental.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.490
We're all making
sacrifices here.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.446
(indistinct chatter)

32:27.479 --> 32:29.982
Hey, guys, grab your stuff
and let's go.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.820
THUNDERBIRD: It's Jace Turner
again. He was at the clinic.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.155
He must have tracked us here
somehow.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.757
He's almost as good as you.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.027
Look, if you can portal
everyone there,

32:41.060 --> 32:42.694
we got a straight shot
to the road.

32:42.728 --> 32:45.131
They're gonna notice when we
pop up behind them like gophers.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.465
I don't know about you,

32:46.498 --> 32:47.666
but I can't run faster
than a pickup truck.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.801
Eclipse, Skyler,
and Naya can cover us.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.438
Shatter and I will run
interference.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.841
Hey, everybody, on my signal,
get ready to run!

32:55.874 --> 32:59.145
I'm gonna open up a portal.
I need you guys to move through

32:59.178 --> 33:01.680
as quickly as possible and seek
cover as fast as you can.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.816
-Bomb!
-It's gas!

33:04.850 --> 33:06.052
Everybody get out!

33:06.085 --> 33:07.719
Run!

33:07.753 --> 33:09.221
Get to the back of the building.

33:09.255 --> 33:11.190
(coughing)

33:13.025 --> 33:14.693
-Clarice. Clarice.
-(coughing)

33:14.726 --> 33:16.562
Come here.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.130
(grunts)

33:18.164 --> 33:19.665
(coughs)

33:24.703 --> 33:26.638
MAN:
Let's go, let's go.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.774
-(guns cocking)
-Move it! Drop down!

33:30.576 --> 33:32.511
-(coughing)
-(grunting)

33:38.550 --> 33:40.719
(man shouting)

33:40.752 --> 33:42.254
We have to go back
for the others.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.490
We can't.
That is Halothane-X gas.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.825
If you go back there, you'll be
unconscious in seconds.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.927
ECLIPSE: Halothane-X?
Didn't the cops stop using that

33:48.960 --> 33:50.996
after all those people
got trampled?

33:51.029 --> 33:53.232
We're not dealing with cops.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.834
(Thunderbird grunting)

33:55.867 --> 33:57.203
(groans)

33:57.236 --> 33:58.937
SHATTER:
We got to get out, man.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.673
With those guys by the trucks,
we're sitting ducks.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.842
-What do we do now?
-Is there another way out
of here?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.444
There is,
there is a service tunnel

34:05.477 --> 34:06.845
on that side of the building.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.780
But it's on the other side
of the wall.

34:08.814 --> 34:12.251
We use it to bring people in,
but we can't get to it

34:12.284 --> 34:13.485
without going back through
the gas.

34:16.922 --> 34:19.758
-I can help with the wall.
-ECLIPSE: Okay, well,

34:19.791 --> 34:21.627
we're still gonna have to deal
with the guys outside.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.030
Maybe I can take 'em out.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.532
You can't go out there, man.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.234
My body can handle most
small arms fire.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.468
You sure?

34:29.501 --> 34:30.436
This the only chance we got.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.740
-All right.
-Okay.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.575
Three, two... (yells)

34:40.479 --> 34:42.481
(gunfire)

34:42.514 --> 34:44.316
(yelling)

34:46.652 --> 34:48.019
(gunfire)

34:49.821 --> 34:52.491
Come on, come on.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.759
Come on.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.394
(gunfire)

34:55.427 --> 34:57.329
(yelling)

34:57.363 --> 34:58.964
Whoa, whoa!

34:58.997 --> 35:00.098
Get down!

35:00.132 --> 35:01.099
(screams)

35:01.133 --> 35:02.668
Damn it.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.772
(Ray screaming)

35:10.476 --> 35:11.443
(screaming stops)

35:11.477 --> 35:12.378
KYLE:
Ray!

35:13.812 --> 35:14.946
ECLIPSE:
Oh, hey, kid.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.782
(grunts)

35:18.450 --> 35:19.451
THUNDERBIRD:
Come on, Reed.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.986
You can do this.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.425
Look inside.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.527
It's in you.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.867
Don't make me do this!
Get on the ground!

35:35.901 --> 35:37.236
(yells)

35:39.371 --> 35:40.506
(screams)

35:40.539 --> 35:42.841
LAUREN: But you and Mom
have never once talked

35:42.874 --> 35:45.277
about what it might mean for me
to have Andy come home.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.312
ELLEN:
He's your son.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.521
Shatter!

35:55.554 --> 35:58.123
(grunting)

35:58.156 --> 35:59.825
(rumbling)

35:59.858 --> 36:01.860
(groans)

36:08.033 --> 36:09.535
Follow him now, go, quick!

36:09.568 --> 36:10.502
Come on.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.741
THUNDERBIRD:
Go! Get her, get her.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.961
(knock on door)

36:37.796 --> 36:40.999
I told you to stay the hell
away from us.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.034
-Was I unclear?
-Look,

36:43.068 --> 36:44.870
if you want to
tear my head off, fine.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.638
Just please hear me out.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.245
Um,

36:53.279 --> 36:57.115
I-I should never have been
inside your baby's head.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.750
-Yeah.
-She was crying,

36:58.784 --> 37:01.953
and I needed to talk to you.

37:01.987 --> 37:06.224
It was wrong, and I'm sorry.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.193
But I felt something in her.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.928
Something I've never
felt before.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.031
The love of a mother.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.766
I didn't have a mommy either.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.135
That doesn't give you the right
to invade my child's mind.

37:17.168 --> 37:20.872
No, it doesn't. I...

37:20.906 --> 37:23.575
manipulated you
because we need you.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.944
-(scoffs)
-Because that's what we do.

37:25.977 --> 37:30.248
We... we make people do
what we need them to do.

37:30.282 --> 37:33.251
That's--
that's why we were made.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.553
That's no excuse.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.921
You don't just have
to accept that.

37:35.954 --> 37:36.855
We didn't.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.727
You deserve to know
the whole story.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.228
What are you talking about?

37:43.261 --> 37:47.899
We didn't start off as triplets.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.302
DOCTOR (over P.A.):
Esme, Phoebe, Sophie,

37:50.336 --> 37:51.670
report for duty.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.606
ESME:
During our exercises,

37:54.640 --> 37:57.108
they kept two of us locked up
as leverage.

37:57.142 --> 38:01.347
Celeste and Mindee had
to stay back that day.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.315
(screaming)

38:06.852 --> 38:07.653
YOUNG ESME:
Grab your guns.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.820
Fire.

38:08.854 --> 38:09.988
ESME:
When we decided to escape,

38:10.021 --> 38:11.623
we thought we could
save everyone.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.958
We were wrong.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.327
-(collars buzzing)
-(gasping)

38:15.361 --> 38:18.430
(sobbing)

38:18.464 --> 38:20.732
ESME: Mindee and Celeste,
we couldn't get them out.

38:23.635 --> 38:27.506
We never told anyone
that story before.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.209
Not even Reeva.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.312
I've felt death.

38:34.346 --> 38:37.483
I was a part of my sisters
when they died.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.154
I felt the pain

38:43.188 --> 38:45.290
and the terror

38:45.323 --> 38:46.958
like it was happening to me.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.627
(crying)

38:48.660 --> 38:53.399
And I would do anything...

38:53.432 --> 38:56.668
anything to protect
your daughter from that.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.307
I'm sorry, I just...

39:02.340 --> 39:06.912
I want you to know that, whether
or not you join this fight,

39:06.945 --> 39:11.049
I'm on your side...

39:11.082 --> 39:12.918
and hers.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.896
(door opens and shuts)

39:32.604 --> 39:35.407
You did it, bud.

39:35.441 --> 39:38.176
Authorities rolled up
the whole station.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.311
Biggest mutant bust in years.

39:43.281 --> 39:45.451
Not how I wanted that
to go down.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.924
Look, those were
some pretty words

39:52.958 --> 39:54.560
about nobody getting hurt.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.729
But that man who died knew
what he signed up for.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.932
He died a hero,
and he'll inspire dozens more.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.002
Want to make an omelet,
you got to some break eggs.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.639
And that guy you cracked open?

40:07.673 --> 40:10.576
Turns out, Humpty Dumpty
supposedly died in Atlanta.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.278
You said your wife thought
you were chasing

40:13.311 --> 40:15.313
some loony conspiracy theory?

40:15.346 --> 40:18.617
Well, look at you now.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.821
Come on.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.122
The guys are buying rounds
of Patrón.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.958
You're one of us now, brother.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.998
Lauren, wait.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.400
There's something
I need to tell you.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.002
What, what is it?

40:37.035 --> 40:40.138
I've been thinking, and I
realized, with this whole trip,

40:40.171 --> 40:42.774
I am making the same mistake
as before,

40:42.808 --> 40:44.743
dragging you into a fight
that is not yours.

40:44.776 --> 40:45.977
Mom...

40:46.011 --> 40:48.146
It is not on you
to bring Andy back.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.048
It's on me.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.085
Oh, God.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.521
Honey, you know I love you

40:55.554 --> 40:57.122
every bit as much
as your brother, right?

40:57.155 --> 41:02.160
I-I would never put you at risk
to save him.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.963
I know that.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.634
But you saw the same thing
I did.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.336
Andy thinks he's doing
the right thing.

41:11.369 --> 41:14.305
But the Inner Circle recruited
that psychopath.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.508
If he won't come back
on his own,

41:16.542 --> 41:19.745
I have to fight him
and bring him back myself.

41:21.980 --> 41:26.484
* Out of my, out of my

41:29.020 --> 41:33.091
* Out of my, out of my

41:35.561 --> 41:38.163
* Get out of my head,
out of my head *

41:38.196 --> 41:40.666
* Yeah, we're high and low

41:40.699 --> 41:43.068
* You're dark at your worst

41:43.101 --> 41:44.536
* You're loved
and you're cursed *

41:44.570 --> 41:47.539
* You're high and low,
you're high and low *

41:47.573 --> 41:50.642
* Get out of my head,
out of my head *

41:50.676 --> 41:52.778
* Yeah, we're high and low

41:55.080 --> 41:57.883
* 'Cause you wanted love,
'cause you wanted *

41:59.551 --> 42:02.721
* 'Cause you wanted,
'cause you wanted love *

42:02.754 --> 42:04.422
* 'Cause you wanted

42:07.092 --> 42:11.396
* 'Cause you wanted love,
'cause you wanted... *

42:11.429 --> 42:14.566
What's wrong?
Where's Reed?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.767
Maybe it's best if you don't.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.068
What?

42:29.915 --> 42:30.949
Oh, God...

42:30.982 --> 42:32.884
-Don't come any closer!
-(gasps)

42:32.918 --> 42:37.122
* 'Cause you wanted love.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.590
It won't stop.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.728
I can't make it stop.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.072
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:25.971 --> 43:28.106
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.441
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.779
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.449
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:38.483 --> 43:42.020
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *

* Stand up *

43:59.504 --> 44:01.472
That sounds like fun.
