00:06.343 --> 00:09.665
In my world, you and Sarah had a kid
when you were teenagers - me.

00:09.671 --> 00:11.781
When you see the other me,
show her this.

00:11.787 --> 00:13.968
- Don't you recognise it?
- Don't think so.

00:13.974 --> 00:16.797
- Tell me what I'm looking at.
- A Mexican cafe on wheels.

00:16.798 --> 00:20.248
I want every available car to be
looking out for an Andy Lau.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.324
We think Andy might
be in the other universe.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.300
Why don't you let us find out
what's going on?

00:24.306 --> 00:26.629
If it really is something bad,
then you should go to the cops

00:26.635 --> 00:27.746
and we'll come with you.

00:27.752 --> 00:29.917
The missing Element
wasn't Saskia, it's Ellen.

00:29.923 --> 00:32.215
We need you to come with us,
to help find Andy.

00:32.220 --> 00:35.014
Felix was right all along -
this IS another universe.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.638
What about that incredibly
powerful demon

00:36.644 --> 00:38.407
that wants to restore us
out of this universe?

00:38.413 --> 00:42.365
- Order must be restored.
- And to another world, call us forth!

01:33.025 --> 01:36.025
Synced by Reef
addic7ed.com

01:46.810 --> 01:49.146
Did anyone else see that weird place?

01:49.296 --> 01:51.008
What place?

01:51.194 --> 01:53.164
I didn't see anything.

01:53.838 --> 01:56.757
- I've got to get out of here.
- You OK?

01:56.845 --> 02:00.627
Yeah, sure. Pretty average day, really.
'What did you do today, Ellen?'

02:00.633 --> 02:02.618
'Oh, you know,
just visited another universe.'

02:02.624 --> 02:05.591
- I know it's a head spin.
- I've got to get home.

02:05.597 --> 02:08.416
I've got to go after her,
see if she's OK.

02:08.422 --> 02:11.809
What about Andy?
How are we going to find him?

02:12.657 --> 02:14.910
I'll figure something out, OK?

02:14.977 --> 02:18.473
- Ellen!
- Don't follow me.

02:19.810 --> 02:22.778
Come on, Jake.
Let's get out of here.

02:36.055 --> 02:37.819
Where'd they all go?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.040
Can I help you?

03:12.083 --> 03:13.761
What do you think you're doing?

03:13.762 --> 03:16.766
- You look familiar.
- So do you...

03:33.684 --> 03:36.639
Andy has to be there.
The tracking spell said so.

03:36.645 --> 03:39.769
The tracking spell showed
he wasn't here. That's different.

03:39.775 --> 03:43.792
So he's not here and he's not in
the other universe, where else is there?

03:43.798 --> 03:45.348
I don't know.

03:48.058 --> 03:52.045
I saw something
when we were coming back.

03:52.227 --> 03:53.829
Something...

03:54.814 --> 03:57.132
- In-between.
- Another universe?

03:57.138 --> 03:59.124
No. It felt...

03:59.806 --> 04:02.789
Different. It's hard to explain.

04:08.621 --> 04:10.225
Help me!

04:11.673 --> 04:13.680
Whoa! What is that?

04:13.686 --> 04:15.693
I don't know,
but it's getting bigger.

04:15.699 --> 04:17.875
- You have to do something!
- That is so cool.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.182
It must be your power manifesting.
Sorry, I should have warned you.

04:21.188 --> 04:22.793
You think?

04:22.801 --> 04:24.538
Enough with the lightning!

04:24.544 --> 04:27.626
Looks like it's responding to your mood.
I'm coming over; just keep calm.

04:27.632 --> 04:31.221
Yeah, sure.
There's only a storm in my bedroom!

04:31.227 --> 04:33.030
OK, see you after work.

04:33.043 --> 04:34.571
Bye.

04:44.477 --> 04:46.456
I was worried about you.

04:46.462 --> 04:48.781
I was going to call.
I don't have a phone.

04:48.782 --> 04:51.766
- Really?
- I know everyone does, but...

04:52.291 --> 04:54.291
Did you find your friend?

05:05.844 --> 05:07.461
You will.

05:07.703 --> 05:11.352
- I wish I didn't mess things up.
- It's not your fault.

05:11.358 --> 05:13.733
You just weren't the right
Element, that's all.

05:14.311 --> 05:16.334
You're still magic.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.704
Better get that.

05:22.765 --> 05:25.175
Um, come in?

05:35.195 --> 05:36.576
Hello?

05:38.550 --> 05:40.502
No, she's not here.

05:42.280 --> 05:44.634
Yeah, this is Jake. What's up?

05:49.070 --> 05:52.044
Just get your hands off me!
I'm an officer of the law.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.923
- Oh. What does that make me?
- Is that your father?

05:54.934 --> 05:57.410
- Kind of. Not really.
- You're making a mistake.

05:57.416 --> 05:59.939
You just count yourself lucky
that you're not under arrest.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.309
Gary! I mean, Dad.

06:02.315 --> 06:04.879
- Jake, can you explain to this man...
- I can.

06:04.885 --> 06:08.157
He's on his way to Griffo's
fancy-dress party later.

06:08.163 --> 06:11.159
- What?
- You love fancy dress. Come on.

06:12.192 --> 06:13.758
Right.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.958
Must have made a mistake.

06:17.737 --> 06:20.365
Might be best if you let your mum
deal with this one.

06:20.371 --> 06:22.202
It's OK, I'm used to it.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.073
Come on, Dad.

06:27.540 --> 06:31.794
- How did you get here?
- Is <i>here</i> where I think it is?

06:32.581 --> 06:36.933
Remember when I told you you were
my father in another universe?

06:46.218 --> 06:50.337
- It's bad luck to open umbrellas indoors.
- Except when attacked by weather.

06:53.069 --> 06:55.718
- Amazing.
- I'm so glad you like it.

06:55.724 --> 06:59.927
You and Andy share the same Element,
but your power manifests differently.

06:59.933 --> 07:02.668
Never mind that!
How do I turn it off?

07:02.674 --> 07:03.837
You don't.

07:03.843 --> 07:08.396
- So I'm stuck with a pet cloud?
- You're stuck with the power.

07:10.616 --> 07:14.101
- The cloud, you might be able to control.
- "Might"...?

07:16.296 --> 07:17.498
Here.

07:21.657 --> 07:22.874
Take my hands.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.974
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Would you feel better if I said yes?

07:28.929 --> 07:30.421
Close your eyes.

07:34.514 --> 07:38.835
Concentrate on my voice
and blue skies.

07:39.011 --> 07:42.264
Think of calm, blue skies.

07:45.814 --> 07:49.858
- Think of something really calming.
- Like what?

07:50.179 --> 07:54.793
You're at a gig. The music's
pumping and you're dancing.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.061
Sorry. Ah, I mean...

07:58.302 --> 08:01.513
You're watching
other people dance...

08:02.856 --> 08:05.334
But you're making fun of them.

08:07.441 --> 08:09.810
We're making fun of them together.

08:18.921 --> 08:20.475
Reopen your eyes.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.458
It's gone!

08:25.578 --> 08:27.270
Amazing.

08:30.175 --> 08:31.775
Better go.

08:31.781 --> 08:33.744
Call me if...

08:34.558 --> 08:36.417
What's the matter?

08:38.515 --> 08:42.831
Water's a conductor, right? And you
and Andy are both Water Elements.

08:42.837 --> 08:44.359
So...?

08:49.479 --> 08:51.430
Different universe?

08:53.379 --> 08:55.980
Everything looks exactly the same.

08:56.152 --> 08:59.692
- Except for you. I don't remember you.
- I'm new.

08:59.846 --> 09:02.459
So I'm not a cop in this universe?

09:02.465 --> 09:05.656
Yeah. I guess things
got in the way here.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.782
Having a great kid?
No, I don't think so.

09:09.476 --> 09:14.075
- And Sarah, is she here?
- Yeah, but she's different.

09:14.081 --> 09:16.052
Different, how?

09:16.058 --> 09:19.065
Well, she doesn't live in a big,
fancy house in this universe.

09:19.179 --> 09:20.830
It's just me and her.

09:22.806 --> 09:26.895
Does she laugh a lot,
does she still like pop music?

09:26.901 --> 09:29.693
Is she... happy?

09:30.802 --> 09:32.946
She's not a real-estate agent.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.120
Sure I can't just have
a quick look around?

09:35.126 --> 09:36.881
This kind of thing
doesn't happen every day.

09:36.887 --> 09:40.782
Trust me, you're safer here.
I'm safe with you here too.

09:43.801 --> 09:45.184
Jake?

09:45.771 --> 09:47.366
Yeah?

09:48.269 --> 09:50.078
Good to see you, son.

09:55.064 --> 09:58.508
Wow. It must be strange
to have two dads.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.915
- This one's not technically my dad.
- Do you want him to be?

10:04.491 --> 10:06.467
I've got to tell Felix.

10:14.810 --> 10:18.746
<i>Hiya, this is Felix.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.</i>

10:26.940 --> 10:31.249
- You didn't leave a message.
- Maybe we can hold off for a bit.

10:31.853 --> 10:33.869
One more day shouldn't hurt.

10:41.015 --> 10:45.072
- These the only clean clothes you've got?
- Cleanish, mate.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.975
Aren't you a bit old
for making scarecrows?

10:48.037 --> 10:52.076
- It's for a school project.
- Yeah! That's the way you do it.

10:53.050 --> 10:56.478
Yeah... I've got a game coming up this
weekend, if you wanted to come.

10:56.484 --> 10:58.992
Yeah, sure, mate.
I wouldn't miss that.

10:58.998 --> 11:03.287
Unless, of course, your car breaks down
or you sleep in again and forget.

11:03.293 --> 11:06.777
Go, boys! They're playing
a blinder today. Whoo!

11:06.810 --> 11:09.766
Hey, mate, could you just
pass us that drink?

11:20.659 --> 11:23.101
- You're quiet today.
- I'm alright.

11:23.336 --> 11:27.197
Thanks for the new duds.
Red really is my colour.

11:27.203 --> 11:30.242
- You think so?
- Handsome is in our genes.

11:30.637 --> 11:32.664
You sure your dad won't mind
me borrowing them?

11:32.670 --> 11:34.900
He won't even notice they're gone.

11:35.420 --> 11:38.348
He's a good bloke though, good dad?

11:40.228 --> 11:42.322
You've almost made this place
look liveable.

11:42.328 --> 11:46.893
We have. Pretty handy on the tools,
such as they are.

11:47.413 --> 11:48.956
So how long are we gonna be here,

11:48.962 --> 11:51.461
should I start thinking about
some indoor plumbing?

11:51.473 --> 11:54.676
Well, there are some complications.

11:54.991 --> 11:56.943
Complications...?

11:57.055 --> 11:58.607
Just logistics.

11:58.613 --> 12:02.284
This whole undoing-magic stuff
can take a bit of figuring out.

12:02.750 --> 12:07.196
It just gives us more time to hang out.
May as well make the best of it.

12:08.905 --> 12:13.725
Alright, coffee break's over.
Chuck us up some of those nails, will you?

12:22.921 --> 12:27.083
- Sorry. Got caught up.
- Dude, you're a mess.

12:29.071 --> 12:32.586
Jake was helping me
with some gardening.

12:32.592 --> 12:37.029
OK, so I've got a theory. Ellen and
Andy are both Water Elements.

12:37.035 --> 12:38.204
So?

12:38.210 --> 12:41.008
Well, it could mean we can use that
connection to communicate with Andy.

12:41.014 --> 12:43.342
Like a multidimensional
video call.

12:43.386 --> 12:45.658
I hope the reception's better
than Bremin's wi-fi.

12:45.664 --> 12:48.250
Yeah. I spent last night
retooling the tracking spell

12:48.256 --> 12:50.154
to work across different universes.

12:50.325 --> 12:53.176
So is this something
you could do solo?

12:53.182 --> 12:56.481
- Why would you do that?
- I need all of us.

12:56.588 --> 12:58.093
Ellen!

12:59.388 --> 13:00.923
Ah, go!

13:00.929 --> 13:04.044
- We have to stick together. The spell!
- I won't be long.

13:10.183 --> 13:13.170
What are you talking to them about?
Did you find out anything?

13:13.171 --> 13:15.089
- Not yet.
- Where were you yesterday?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.267
You were supposed to come
to the police with me.

13:17.273 --> 13:20.035
Yeah, sorry. I got held up.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.857
That detective won't listen to me.
He thinks I'm just a kid.

13:22.863 --> 13:25.305
- You are just a kid.
- But you're a witness.

13:25.311 --> 13:28.215
You found the print-outs to those
spells. He'll listen to you.

13:28.221 --> 13:30.778
Ellen, we have to go - now.

13:30.832 --> 13:34.235
- Go where?
- Science presentation.

13:35.159 --> 13:36.555
Ow! What are you doing?

13:36.561 --> 13:38.572
Have they put you
in some weird, magic trance?

13:38.578 --> 13:40.943
Ellen! Come on.

13:41.015 --> 13:43.433
Ellen, it's important.

13:45.071 --> 13:46.734
I'm sorry, Viv.

13:53.936 --> 13:56.477
Hello! Anyone in here?

13:58.052 --> 14:00.913
Well, hang on - remember
what happened last time?

14:00.919 --> 14:02.476
We've got all
the right elements now.

14:02.482 --> 14:03.923
We can't risk the spell going wrong.

14:03.929 --> 14:06.621
- You are the expert of spell fail.
- Felix is right.

14:06.627 --> 14:08.579
I'll keep lookout.

14:10.092 --> 14:12.525
- Nice one.
- Sam, fill the sink.

14:13.782 --> 14:17.227
- We're gonna talk to Andy out of a sink?
- Better than a toilet.

14:21.589 --> 14:25.261
- Everyone ready?
- Not really. What do I do?

14:25.267 --> 14:28.794
Just keep calm and concentrate.
It'll be OK.

14:34.044 --> 14:37.540
Across the divide, let water fall.

14:37.545 --> 14:40.585
Bind like Elements, hear our call.

14:48.422 --> 14:51.210
Bind like Elements, hear our call.

14:55.974 --> 14:58.966
Bind like Elements, hear our call!

15:02.128 --> 15:03.775
Maybe he's engaged.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.787
- Something was happening.
- The link's not strong enough.

15:07.052 --> 15:10.060
I think we need something connected
to Andy <i>and</i> Ellen.

15:11.502 --> 15:14.233
What about that necklace -
the one Andy gave me?

15:14.239 --> 15:16.822
It's crossed universes, you've
both owned it, that's perfect.

15:16.828 --> 15:17.932
Well, where is it?

15:17.938 --> 15:20.791
Bates is on the warpath - something
about science presentations.

15:20.797 --> 15:22.671
We'll have to get it after school.

15:22.677 --> 15:25.400
I've got to be somewhere after
school. I'll catch up with you.

15:25.406 --> 15:27.048
- What's so important?
- We're in the girls' bathroom.

15:27.054 --> 15:28.397
Can we just go?

15:35.191 --> 15:36.725
Andy's the priority.

15:36.731 --> 15:40.083
Once we get that sorted, I'll tell
the others about this Gary.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.320
Don't you want to send him home?

15:48.419 --> 15:49.821
Gary...?

15:54.244 --> 15:57.231
'Gone exploring.
Promise I'll be careful.'

15:57.237 --> 16:00.061
- Oh, no...
- We have to find him.

16:00.436 --> 16:01.878
Find who?

16:05.450 --> 16:09.043
- Don't you remember where you put it?
- I didn't really like it.

16:09.049 --> 16:11.571
Mum's tried to give me jewellery
like that before.

16:11.577 --> 16:13.524
It's so... Nanna.

16:15.060 --> 16:17.516
Maybe Mum thought it was hers.
You check her room.

16:17.522 --> 16:21.047
- I am not going through your mum's undies.
- You're not going through mine!

16:21.053 --> 16:25.177
Check her jewellery box on the dresser.
Look for the ugliest necklace you can find.

16:26.512 --> 16:29.162
Don't tell her about it, please.

16:29.461 --> 16:32.318
So this whole time,
you've been hiding a second father?

16:32.324 --> 16:34.283
I was gonna tell you, as soon
as we found Andy.

16:34.289 --> 16:35.405
Felix is gonna freak!

16:35.411 --> 16:38.043
One day with a normal dad -
why is that so much to ask?

16:38.049 --> 16:40.575
Because he's from
another universe, Jake.

16:40.581 --> 16:42.929
No sign. Maybe he went into town.

16:43.122 --> 16:45.126
We have to tell Felix.

16:47.076 --> 16:48.481
OK.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.663
Found it.

16:54.219 --> 16:56.207
OK, that's weird.

16:57.208 --> 17:01.922
- Same object, from two universes.
- So Mum must have had that one all along.

17:07.810 --> 17:09.029
What's up?

17:09.367 --> 17:12.419
- OK, don't freak out.
- About what?

17:13.884 --> 17:18.114
- The other Gary is here - cop Gary.
- Where is he?

17:18.488 --> 17:20.627
We think he might have gone
into town.

17:22.979 --> 17:24.825
We're on our way.

17:25.230 --> 17:26.924
We have to go.

17:31.433 --> 17:32.687
What...?

17:41.032 --> 17:42.988
What just happened?

17:43.770 --> 17:46.387
The same object
from two universes...

17:46.459 --> 17:49.289
- Maybe if they touch...
- They cancel each other out.

17:49.295 --> 17:51.358
Like matter and antimatter.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.428
- How do you know that?
- I listen in Science class.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.968
We've got a big problem...

17:59.111 --> 18:00.555
Two Garys.

18:02.252 --> 18:05.247
<i>Hola</i>. Mexican soda?

18:05.566 --> 18:07.558
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:12.498 --> 18:15.054
<i>Hola</i>. Mexican soda?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.472
- This is your place?
- Yep. Why?

18:17.478 --> 18:21.517
Nothing, just didn't think you were
the hospitality type.

18:21.872 --> 18:23.592
Do we know each other?

18:23.598 --> 18:25.609
Looks great. What's in it?

18:25.662 --> 18:27.714
- Lemonade.
- And...?

18:28.478 --> 18:30.188
A straw.

18:30.422 --> 18:31.971
Sure.

18:32.662 --> 18:35.380
Hi! What are you doing here?

18:36.398 --> 18:38.058
You alright?

18:38.945 --> 18:40.544
Got you a drink.

18:41.021 --> 18:46.143
- Oh. They're good, aren't they?
- Everything about this place is...

18:47.238 --> 18:48.738
Fantastic.

18:48.744 --> 18:50.783
Are you sure you're OK, Gary?

18:51.447 --> 18:54.171
- Never better.
- OK.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.074
Thanks.

19:12.714 --> 19:14.057
Gary!

19:14.272 --> 19:15.516
Yeah?

19:15.522 --> 19:19.051
- How'd you get here? What happened?
- I walked, with my legs.

19:19.052 --> 19:21.342
Checking out the new Mexican van.

19:21.715 --> 19:23.136
It's not him.

19:23.142 --> 19:24.898
Jake, what's going on?

19:24.923 --> 19:28.188
Dad, you need to go home.
You can't stay in town.

19:28.194 --> 19:30.738
- Why not?
- Maybe you left the oven on.

19:30.944 --> 19:32.470
People do that.

19:32.513 --> 19:35.781
- My oven's broken?
- But the neighbours can smell gas.

19:35.787 --> 19:40.529
Oh. I had baked beans for lunch.
Now I'm going to have some Mexican!

19:40.562 --> 19:42.686
Come on - that was funny!

19:42.692 --> 19:44.257
Get him home, now.

19:44.263 --> 19:46.035
Tell us another joke.

19:48.402 --> 19:51.409
You crack one bad joke
and your son's embarrassed of you.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.228
- How long has he been here?
- Not long.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.801
How long?

19:55.493 --> 19:57.199
Since last night.

19:57.455 --> 20:00.237
- I was gonna tell you!
- Do you know how dangerous this is?

20:00.243 --> 20:02.680
If he meets the other Gary,
they'll destroy each other.

20:02.686 --> 20:04.718
- What?
- Mexican soda?

20:13.661 --> 20:15.119
Rude!

20:19.091 --> 20:23.078
How could I forget? You, a karaoke
machine and Wa Wa Nee.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.584
- What's got into you today?
- I don't know. I feel like a new man.

20:30.059 --> 20:31.907
We need to get him back.

20:33.351 --> 20:34.956
I know.

20:38.060 --> 20:41.465
- Dad?
- Ah, Jake. Hi.

20:41.471 --> 20:45.201
- Jake, have something to eat with us.
- I'm sorry, Mum. We've got to go.

20:45.207 --> 20:46.718
- OK.
- Oh! Where?

20:46.724 --> 20:48.732
- You can't do this.
- I wanted to talk to her.

20:48.738 --> 20:51.228
You can't.
This universe doesn't want you here.

21:00.165 --> 21:02.525
- So what's the plan?
- Send him back.

21:02.531 --> 21:06.151
- Can you do that?
- I'll need the others, and this.

21:12.533 --> 21:14.154
What's happening?

21:16.489 --> 21:19.788
- It's a restoring demon.
- Order must be restored.

21:19.794 --> 21:22.592
Get it? He's eating a pomegranate!

21:22.598 --> 21:25.166
What's wrong with you two?
That was hilarious.

21:27.344 --> 21:30.359
That thing with the eyes,
it's happening to him.

21:30.691 --> 21:32.570
Order must be restored.

21:32.576 --> 21:33.753
Felix, the talisman.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.275
It won't do anything
without Ellen and Sam.

21:37.703 --> 21:39.680
- What do we do?
- Run.

21:47.622 --> 21:49.700
Gary, give it back.

21:52.927 --> 21:54.955
You have to give it back!

22:05.049 --> 22:06.218
Where is he going?

22:15.819 --> 22:18.500
If they touch,
they'll cancel each other out.

22:26.079 --> 22:27.291
Stop him!

22:29.958 --> 22:31.081
Jake!

22:31.087 --> 22:33.329
Felix! Do something.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.956
Do something!

22:37.040 --> 22:38.419
Gary, stop!

22:41.163 --> 22:45.649
Dad, it's me. You can't go near him.
You have to stay away. Don't touch him.

22:49.238 --> 22:52.342
- Delay them while I get the talisman.
- They're gonna touch!

23:06.242 --> 23:08.051
Keep going!

23:14.840 --> 23:18.035
- I'll hold him down.
- The talisman, the talisman!

23:19.316 --> 23:21.106
- Hurry up!
- I am!

23:25.006 --> 23:28.111
Draw a circle around cop Gary.
Quickly!

23:40.486 --> 23:44.432
Sam! Help! Use your power.

24:02.470 --> 24:06.719
- Sam! Cop Gary's out of the circle!
- He has to be in the circle!

24:15.921 --> 24:18.908
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee!

24:18.909 --> 24:21.177
Return us all
to where we should be.

24:21.183 --> 24:24.578
Take this earth, fire, water, air.

24:24.584 --> 24:27.576
Universe will reclaim and repair.

24:35.572 --> 24:38.547
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee!

24:38.560 --> 24:40.701
Return us all
to where we should be.

24:40.707 --> 24:43.592
Take this earth, fire, water, air.

24:43.598 --> 24:46.197
Universe will reclaim and repair.

24:50.814 --> 24:52.117
Gary, it's OK.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.709
Reclaim and repair. Reclaim...

24:54.715 --> 24:56.989
- Jake...?
- You're going home.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.087
Reclaim and repair!

25:13.429 --> 25:15.425
Guys, look, over there.

25:18.438 --> 25:19.911
It's that place.

25:24.883 --> 25:26.237
Andy...?

25:26.760 --> 25:28.146
Andy!

25:35.602 --> 25:38.976
<i>Next time</i>

25:42.472 --> 25:44.702
Looked like that place I saw
between the universes.

25:44.708 --> 25:47.159
- What's that?
- The other you made it for Andy.

25:47.165 --> 25:49.172
The other me is sick-making.

25:49.277 --> 25:51.670
Where's the talisman?
What about Saskia?

25:51.676 --> 25:53.526
She must have taken the talisman.

25:53.532 --> 25:55.990
- Why would I do that?
- I told him it was crazy.

25:56.448 --> 25:58.132
Where is she?

25:59.384 --> 26:01.825
What is this place,
how do I get out of here?

26:01.831 --> 26:05.238
This is your home now, Andy.
Don't you know that?
