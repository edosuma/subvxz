WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.544
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:03.629 --> 00:06.589
Mags Bennett may have a sizeable
amount of money socked away.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.048
You gonna ask do I have it?

00:08.132 --> 00:10.218
Was just gonna ask
if you knew where she kept it.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.011
Where's my money, man?

00:12.096 --> 00:14.847
We're gonna need someone
with particular skills.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.266
His initials are "Boyd Crowder."

00:17.351 --> 00:19.143
I want to show you something.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.896
Dickie Bennett's gonna pay for that.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.234
How long have you been taking those?

00:26.318 --> 00:28.569
Maybe it is time you leave Kentucky.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.738
I got nowhere else to go.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.157
<i>You deliver Quarles,
show me you can get things done.</i>

00:33.242 --> 00:35.743
Price I gave those other assholes
was $100,000 dead,

00:35.828 --> 00:41.040
$200,000 if Sammy gets a chance to talk
to him about putting a gun in his face.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.875
Thank you, Mr. Tonin. I'll be in touch.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.294
Well, I hear my guest here
is worth some money.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.630
Would you say
you'd be willing just to kill him

00:47.715 --> 00:49.882
to eliminate any chance
of his wriggling free?

00:49.967 --> 00:51.426
I think we can handle him.

00:51.510 --> 00:55.346
Well, it turns out I need a place
to unload the spoils of my earlier endeavors.

00:55.431 --> 00:58.433
There's a whorehouse,
but they also deal to the johns.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.976
It's called Audrey's.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.730
- Hi!
- Think we're about to have us some fun.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.149
What's the price they put on my head?

01:14.742 --> 01:18.411
Check me out. I'm gangsta and shit.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.205
That gun's so little. It's like a lady's pistol.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.374
What do you reckon, a .25?

01:24.126 --> 01:25.460
Looks like a little 9 mil.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.670
.32-caliber ACP.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.506
.32's good.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.426
Close range, anyway.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.553
Hollow points.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.807
They get inside you, and they bounce around
till there's nothing left but paste.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.768
Don't suppose I could have that back.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.770
Or maybe my pants.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.147
I'm afraid I can't help you out there.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.567
We're supposed to keep you company
till the boss comes back.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.986
Said to keep you comfortable.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.532
Comfortable?
Is this part of being comfortable?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.162
No, but that bottle next to you is.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.630
There's a whole lot in here.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.632
Enough to get us all comfortable.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.134
What do you say, ladies?

02:15.219 --> 02:16.761
Let's do this.

02:17.721 --> 02:21.808
- How much?
- $200,000 alive, half of that for a dead man.

02:21.892 --> 02:22.934
And he is alive.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.686
I got him chained like a junkyard dog
at Cat and Minerva's trailer.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.480
Got Jimmy standing guard.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.981
Cat and Minerva's trailer?

02:29.066 --> 02:32.568
I'm sorry. I probably should've checked
with the proprietress.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.028
How do we deliver him?

02:34.112 --> 02:37.949
Frankfort heavy with connections to Detroit,
headed down south as we speak.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.327
Two hundred large
to get rid of that pain in our balls.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.995
That's a nice play, Boyd.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.706
Well, we still got to do a 50/50 split
with this fella named Duffy,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.667
but it does kill two birds.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.043
I'm proud of you, son.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.671
Why, Arlo, thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.756
And what does it mean coming from me?

02:53.841 --> 02:56.926
Well, now, baby, I think you know.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.766
Y'all open?

03:04.601 --> 03:06.102
Well, Errol.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.355
Did you come all the way down here
for a drink?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.691
Not exactly, sir. Not as such.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.944
Well, what can we do for you?

03:15.028 --> 03:18.364
I come bearing a man seeking audience
if you'll have him.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.616
Well, we take all kinds.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.535
Bring him in.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.887
Oh, shit.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.324
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.661
Hold up, now.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.708
Wait. Stop. Wait.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.503
- Stand up. Stand up!
- Boyd, man...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.797
Man, he can't breathe in there.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.300
You need to breathe, Dickie Bennett?
You want to breathe?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.052
- Money!
- Money?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.680
Tell you something, son.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.307
There ain't enough money
in this whole goddamn world.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.225
You understand me? You understand that?

04:28.310 --> 04:29.602
Look, Boyd. That boy's mama died.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.064
She died holding close
to $3.2 million in cash, now.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.565
The only way you got a prayer

04:34.650 --> 04:38.694
in ever laying hands on that money
is between us two right here.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.156
Boyd.

04:42.866 --> 04:46.243
He knew what he was walking into
when he came in here.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.205
I'm curious to hear what ever possessed him.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.546
Boyd, you don't finish
this pile of donkey shit, I'll do it myself.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.132
No. We'll hear him out, and then we'll decide.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.551
Ava, this boy killed Helen.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.013
Just because you suddenly
got Jesus in your heart, all forgivin'.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.641
I hadn't forgot, and he ain't forgiven.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.893
Nor has he hobbled out of here alive yet.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.646
Now, you and he,
you say you got some money.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.692
Now would be a good time
to start talking about where it is.

05:54.896 --> 05:59.025
Sheriff Napier. I can still call you that, right?
I see you're still wearing the uniform.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.819
I won the election.
The office is in contention.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.157
Wouldn't be here if you didn't
need something. What the hell you want?

06:06.241 --> 06:09.410
- Looking for Robert Quarles.
- Never heard of him.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.246
He's from Detroit.
He financed your re-election campaign.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.749
You know, if you know so much,
how come you can't find him yourself?

06:14.833 --> 06:18.544
- You're the Marshal. Isn't that what you do?
- Yeah, it is, and this is how we do it.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.923
You got any idea what it's like running
local law enforcement in this county?

06:23.008 --> 06:25.217
- Some, I'd expect.
- No, you don't.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.554
At the end of the day, you truck off
to Lexington or wherever the hell you go,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.765
put it all in your rearview mirror.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.476
I go home right up to that holler.
And let me tell you, son.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.437
This shit follows me home
like a three-legged dog.

06:36.521 --> 06:39.398
You been doing this long enough.
You should know to pick better partners.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.734
So now you gonna start in on me, too.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.946
Dragging in my financiers,
starting all that forensic-accounting bullshit.

06:46.031 --> 06:49.909
That's FBI and Treasury.
Marshals don't give a shit who paid who.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.660
Then why the hell are you here?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.330
I told you. I'm looking for Robert Quarles.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.665
I'm trying to send you home
with one less problem on your mind.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.834
Now, do you know where he is or not?

07:00.170 --> 07:02.755
Last I heard, he was hanging out
at a joint called Audrey's,

07:02.839 --> 07:05.216
looking to sell off some pills.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.511
Thank you.

07:09.012 --> 07:13.140
Deputy, you get a chance to put some bullets
in that towheaded son of a bitch,

07:13.225 --> 07:16.310
sure be nice if he knew one came from me.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.984
Suck it down, Catty! Own that shit, girl!

07:24.069 --> 07:26.487
Too much for the lady to handle.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.740
I can handle anything you dish out, blondie.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.033
You ever see Platoon?

07:31.118 --> 07:34.703
The movie with the old people
where they go to outer space?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.956
<i>That's Cocoon. Platoon's the...</i>

07:38.208 --> 07:40.292
Come here. Come over here.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.711
Come here. Put your mouth on this.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.965
Don't be scared.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.967
Step right up. Put 'em around there.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.635
Boom!

07:52.222 --> 07:54.265
You chipped my tooth, asshole!

07:54.349 --> 07:58.018
I'm sorry. This'll make it feel much better.
I promise. Trust me. Trust me.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.902
That's it. That's it. That's it.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.654
Bye bye!

08:08.738 --> 08:10.698
Where in the hell did he get a shotgun?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.158
We didn't bring any shells.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.326
- No shit.
- Who's next on the shotgun train?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.162
I got my ticket right here.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.914
Next stop, Highland Park.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.086
- Party's over, assholes.
- Over? It just started.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.505
Just point yourself in any direction
and dive right in, son.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.466
We got paying customers inside
waiting on mouths

08:29.551 --> 08:30.676
to get in there and blow 'em.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.720
Do you have to be such a dick?

08:32.804 --> 08:34.221
I mean, can't you just leave one of them here
for me?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.515
You need me to remind you
how you come to have that chain there?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.433
Well, maybe I'll gnaw it off like a coyote,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.227
and come back, and find you,
and shoot you in your face.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.854
There's enough Oxy in here
you'd probably never feel it.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.608
And then I wouldn't have
to babysit your crazy ass anymore.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.203
Five minutes. All right, five minutes.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.079
Y'all got five minutes to finish your smoke.

08:59.164 --> 09:02.833
Then you got to get inside
and start smoking something else.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.293
Crazy bitches.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.378
Five minutes.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.965
Bye.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.387
Any noise out of that
filthy whore mouth of yours,

09:15.472 --> 09:19.475
and I will rip her head off with this chain.
Do you understand?

09:20.644 --> 09:24.230
Jimmy, get in here.
I think he's having some kind of seizure.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.731
Come on!

09:31.988 --> 09:34.281
Look, I'm just telling you what I know.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.075
You're saying after all this time,

09:36.159 --> 09:39.787
Limehouse is keeping that money
in a safety deposit box at a bank?

09:39.871 --> 09:41.789
Well, he got to keep it somewhere,
doesn't he?

09:41.873 --> 09:42.998
It's the 21st century.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.043
We hadn't been burying money
under churches for a long time now.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.169
Why now?

09:47.712 --> 09:50.422
Mr. Limehouse moves
the money around all the time.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.591
Kind of a shell game.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.593
I heard him say he gonna
move things around again tomorrow.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.512
- Which bank?
- Gallatin.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.222
Down near Benham.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.267
- You know it?
- I have some familiarity with it.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.186
- Meaning you robbed it.
- Got no qualms about robbing it again.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.562
Well, then we need to go in and...

10:05.647 --> 10:09.775
We ain't got any kind of crew
to go after a bank job.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.861
I say we do both of them.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.948
Have done with it.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.325
Worth $3.2 million
seeing us bleed on your floor?

10:18.410 --> 10:20.494
It is to me.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.372
Errol, just give us a moment, please.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.542
Take all the time you need.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.800
Ava, I need you to take Arlo down
and reconnoiter the bank.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.470
Try to get access to that safe deposit box.
See what we're dealing with.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.975
- Why do I got to go?
- Because this ain't your first rodeo.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.270
And I need your eyes the way I need her eyes.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.438
What are you gonna do?

10:47.522 --> 10:49.106
Well, I'm gonna try to put my hands
on some Emulex

10:49.190 --> 10:51.275
in case you call and say
that this dog will hunt.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.776
- All right.
- In the meantime,

10:52.861 --> 10:54.528
I'm gonna deliver that baby to Detroit.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.572
Sounds good. Let's go, Arlo.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.328
Hey.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.414
Hey, are you sure you're all right with this?

11:05.498 --> 11:09.001
$3.2 million. I might find a way to get right.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.407
You know what the two saddest words
in the English language are?

11:40.492 --> 11:41.867
"What party?"

11:41.951 --> 11:44.328
That's kind of how I feel right now.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.207
You all right, ma'am? You okay?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.295
I know you. You work with Boyd, don't you?

11:54.172 --> 11:57.132
You gonna have to get some bolt cutters.
That pasty sack of shit took the key.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.592
- Quarles?
- Yeah.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.970
- He didn't say where he was headed, did he?
- What do you think?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.348
- Are you gonna get us out of these or what?
- Why?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.850
From where I'm standing,
it doesn't look so bad.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.310
Givens.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.647
He coming back?

12:12.899 --> 12:16.527
The boxes we have for rent
are right through here.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.032
- Miss Reutter?
- Thank you.

12:22.117 --> 12:25.536
As you can see, we have a variety of sizes,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.789
- priced accordingly, of course.
- Of course.

12:29.290 --> 12:33.085
But we like to think we have
something to suit everyone's needs.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.254
Well, it certainly would appear so.

12:36.339 --> 12:40.008
Is there anything else
you'd like to see today?

12:40.510 --> 12:45.597
No. I think I have seen everything I need to.
Thank you very much.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.684
Have you had lunch? 'Cause I was gonna
step around the corner to the luncheonette.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.061
They got a pretty good club sandwich.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.188
Club sandwich is my favorite, but...

12:56.693 --> 12:59.319
- Nice car.
- New state issue, unmarked.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.863
Wouldn't outrun a dairy cow.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.948
Well, at least it's new.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.742
- So what's going on?
- Well, we got a few things.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.786
One is your old pal Dickie
was up at Boyd's bar,

13:07.871 --> 13:10.205
had Limehouse's right-hand man in tow.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.792
Good a place as any for him to die, I guess.
Why are we here?

13:13.877 --> 13:15.836
Well, Ava left out of there not long after.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.880
She's been in the bank about 15 minutes.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.798
Has your daddy along with.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.800
- Window?
- Shit. Sorry.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.637
Thanks.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.558
He's over there casing the place
about as subtle as a marching band.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.895
- Call the FBI?
- I did. I wouldn't hold your breath.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.813
They mentioned something
about how this podunk chicken shack

13:34.898 --> 13:37.024
wasn't worth their rush.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.944
So Dickie's with Limehouse's guy
up at Boyd's,

13:41.029 --> 13:43.864
and these two are down here poking around.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.450
Make for some strange bedfellows,
don't you think?

13:46.534 --> 13:49.161
I think if I've ever seen a clutch of fools
fixin' to rob a place,

13:49.245 --> 13:50.871
I'm looking at it right now.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.883
I told you just to kill him.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.010
And I told you if I'm next to see him, I will.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.012
Have you got any idea
the position you put me in?

14:07.096 --> 14:10.057
I told a man in Detroit
that I would bring him Robert Quarles.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.518
- Now, does the name Theo Tonin ring a bell?
- No.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.853
No? Let me tell you about Theo Tonin.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.190
The man carries an ear in his pocket.
He carries a human ear in his pocket.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.651
And when he wants to talk to somebody,
he wants to get their attention,

14:20.735 --> 14:24.029
he reaches into his pocket, takes out the ear,
and he speaks directly into it.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.447
What does he say?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.077
The point is, Mr. Crowder,
when he asks me, and he will,

14:30.161 --> 14:31.453
where Robert Quarles is,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.665
does Theo Tonin sound like the kind of man
to whom you'd like to say,

14:34.749 --> 14:38.210
"I'm sorry, but he escaped
from a disease-ridden whore factory

14:38.294 --> 14:40.087
"up in inbred Holler"?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.507
I'm gonna let that one go.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.175
Now here's the thing, Mr. Duffy.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.595
What we have before us,
contrary to appearances,

14:48.680 --> 14:49.888
is an amazing opportunity.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.766
Now, later on tonight,
I'm gonna walk into a bank,

14:52.850 --> 14:57.813
I'm gonna open a little box,
and I'm gonna walk outwith $3.2 million,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.690
of which I'm willing to give you a cut.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.277
Now, what I'd like to do is create a diversion.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.445
Say, blow up a car a few miles away.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.698
And while the world
is going in one direction,

15:07.782 --> 15:10.951
well, I just walk in the other direction.

15:11.035 --> 15:14.079
And what if when that car blows up,
there's a man inside?

15:14.163 --> 15:16.623
And say that man had brilliant blue eyes?

15:16.708 --> 15:19.543
- And a big, stupid baby head?
- That's the same.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.171
Now, right out there in that truck, I got a box
full of Emulex with a cell phone detonator.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.883
Now, when Mr. Quarles comes to see you,
as I know he will,

15:26.968 --> 15:29.928
being that you are the only friend
he has left in this world,

15:30.013 --> 15:33.432
you call me,
and I'll come and set that charge for you.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.933
Problem solved.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.394
Mr. Crowder.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.440
I believe I know how to blow up a car.

15:41.524 --> 15:46.570
Last time we spoke, thought I made
it fairly clear the terms of our arrangement.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.616
Hand to God, I took the steps
in the direction that you indicated.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.493
However, my enemies derailed my plans.

15:53.578 --> 15:56.496
And you figured you could just come
walking back up in here empty-handed.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.583
Well, I figured there must be a way
that a man of my particular skill set

15:59.667 --> 16:01.501
could be of service to your organization.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.213
And what exactly would that be,
your particular skill set?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.883
I think you know.

16:09.177 --> 16:12.137
You are offering your loyal services.

16:12.221 --> 16:17.517
And there just might be a way I can use them
if you understand there will be no derailing.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.811
Either you follow this plan
till the end of the line,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.688
or you add me to your list of enemies,

16:21.773 --> 16:24.775
which, I assure you,
is not a place you want to find yourself.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.902
Do we understand each other?

16:28.404 --> 16:29.529
We understand.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.493
Tonight Boyd Crowder is gonna
rob that bank in Gallatin.

16:34.577 --> 16:38.163
The way he always does.
Blow up something on one end of town,

16:38.247 --> 16:41.917
and while all eyes are there,
he's gonna hit the bank.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.504
Now, when you hear the big boom,
you put your game face on, mister.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.673
And when Boyd comes out that bank,

16:47.757 --> 16:50.884
you hit him hard, and you get that money.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.469
Any questions so far?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.596
Where's Gallatin?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.641
One guard, and that amount of money,
it's gonna be in one of the big boxes.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.310
Hey, hey! So I ain't allowed
to take part in a conversation

17:00.395 --> 17:02.354
about how to steal my $3 million?

17:02.438 --> 17:04.481
- Shut your hole, Dick.
- You want to just tell me that?

17:04.565 --> 17:08.109
As I was saying, that amount of money's
gonna have to be in one of those big boxes.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.070
They're all along this wall, bottom row.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.241
Well, I think I've heard
everything I need to hear.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.450
Me, too.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.787
I'm shit with explosives. How about I drive?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.997
Actually, Arlo, you're gonna sit this one out.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.125
- What?
- So are you, baby.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.085
Wait a minute.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.712
There ain't no reason
to keep me at a distance.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.131
- I can pull...
- They already got you on a security camera.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.425
Now, I need you to take
Arlo back to the house,

17:31.509 --> 17:34.219
sit by the phone
in case anything goes sideways.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.637
You gonna bench me

17:35.722 --> 17:39.057
while Dickie Bennett sits out there
eating all our pretzels?

17:39.142 --> 17:41.309
- Hell no!
- Arlo.

17:41.769 --> 17:45.355
Listen, I'm not saying you're a lion in winter,
but your roar ain't what it used to be.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.275
Now, we gonna take care of Dickie Bennett
when the time is right.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.526
Goddamn, Boyd!

17:49.610 --> 17:52.487
Out of respect for your age
and the place you hold in my heart,

17:52.572 --> 17:55.490
I'm not telling you. I'm asking you.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.744
Now, go with Ava. Let me do what I got to do.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.579
- Come on, Arlo.
- I ain't helpless.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.539
I'm strong as a goddamn bull.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
Raylan, you know that.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.333
- Arlo.
- You know I ain't helpless.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.919
I can take any bank in this county.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.755
- No one's saying you're helpless, Arlo.
- All by myself.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.965
- Come on.
- I don't need you, Boyd.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.349
Robert! Where are you?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.351
Where are you?

18:23.686 --> 18:26.104
I'm in Harlan, looking for you.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.106
<i>Good. Because, Wynn,</i>

18:28.191 --> 18:32.360
we've been presented with an opportunity
to not only survive but prosper.

18:32.820 --> 18:36.698
<i>Now, I need you to meet me
outside the Gallatin bank on Main.</i>

18:36.783 --> 18:37.783
Let's go.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.748
Marshal Givens.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.210
Escort's a nice touch.
It's like visiting the Wizard of Oz.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.628
Yeah, I never seen it.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.713
All them flying monkeys?

18:52.256 --> 18:53.632
Well, you should stick with it.

18:53.716 --> 18:57.135
At the end, they pull the curtain back,
turns out the guy's kind of a pussy.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.805
How you been, Ellstin?

18:59.889 --> 19:02.307
I was wondering
when you was gonna make your way up here.

19:02.391 --> 19:06.561
I had to stop off at the bank first.
You know the Gallatin down the road?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.272
You know they give out toasters still
if you open an account there?

19:09.357 --> 19:11.316
Yeah, you get yourself one of them toasters?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.068
No. Did you?

19:15.571 --> 19:18.114
Surprised to hear
you keep your money there,

19:18.199 --> 19:21.785
seeing as that everyone knows
that place has been robbed so many times.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.912
So you're saying
it's not a secure institution?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.498
No. In fact, I hear that

19:26.582 --> 19:29.835
Boyd Crowder's gonna rob the bank again
this very day.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.838
- Actually, I heard the same thing.
- Did you?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.506
You know what else I heard?

19:34.590 --> 19:36.842
There's a fella name of Robert Quarles

19:36.926 --> 19:39.845
that's gonna rob Boyd Crowder
soon as Boyd come out that bank.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.638
Is that right?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.516
They say there's about $3 million down there.

19:44.600 --> 19:49.020
That's funny how that money bring together
all them wayward personalities.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.897
But they gonna be right there.

19:50.982 --> 19:54.651
All in the same place for you to do
whatever you want to do with them.

19:54.735 --> 19:58.697
Hell, I'd just let them kill each other
if I was you,

19:58.781 --> 19:59.781
but I'm not.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.201
Well, looks like Christmas is coming early
to law enforcement.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.328
Just trying to do my part as a good citizen.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.205
And clear out the competition.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.082
The competition?

20:10.293 --> 20:14.212
Marshal, do I look like
a big criminal warlord to you?

20:14.755 --> 20:17.966
I'm just trying to do
what I've always tried to do.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.303
- Which is?
- Get people to leave us the hell alone.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.889
- Amen?
- Amen.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.768
Well, I've always said it's good to have goals.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.563
But until I deliver that money
into the Marshals Service,

20:31.647 --> 20:34.649
there ain't no way
you're ever gonna be left alone.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.236
- You just wait and let them hit that bank.
- No.

20:38.321 --> 20:42.115
I know it ain't there. Don't try to tell me it is.
It may once have been, but not now.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.742
No. No way you'd risk it.

20:43.826 --> 20:48.246
Now, you tell me you got Boyd and Quarles
all wrapped up in a pretty little bow.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.082
Fantastic. I'm gonna make a call
to everyone who gives a shit.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.627
In the meantime, I am telling you

20:53.711 --> 20:57.589
not a day passes federal boots
aren't on the ground in Nobles Holler,

20:57.673 --> 21:00.967
churning up every acre
and then going over it again,

21:01.052 --> 21:04.387
world without end, until I get what I want.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.600
Now, is that clear?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.734
Cousin Johnny,
pour us a shot of that Elmer T!

21:19.528 --> 21:21.738
Well? We gonna do it?

21:25.660 --> 21:28.286
Well, boys, I believe it's game on.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.830
Right there's a little bit
of good news right there.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.084
You understand the less I hear from you,
the better.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.462
- How we gonna do this?
- Well, that's a great question, cousin Johnny,

21:37.546 --> 21:40.006
'cause I will not be
the only one going through that door.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.467
- Hey, I'll do it. I will do it.
- You're not invited.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.303
The person I want to hear from is Errol.

21:45.930 --> 21:50.183
Unless, of course, you want to give me
that box number right now.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.143
Well, like I said before, Mr. Crowder,

21:52.228 --> 21:55.939
you don't get the number
until you're in the vault.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.983
Insurance. You understand?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.861
Well, I guess it don't matter, 'cause
you're gonna be in there with me, right?

22:01.946 --> 22:04.739
Well, just hold up. Okay?

22:04.824 --> 22:07.826
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
I can't be hearing this right.

22:07.910 --> 22:12.163
Am I not invited somehow
to this whole shindig

22:12.248 --> 22:16.167
wherein upon we're stealing my money?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.920
Do I need to remind you gentlemen
whose money is this again?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.381
- Errol, help me out.
- It's your mama's money, Dickie.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.633
It's my mama's money.
Therefore it is my money.

22:23.718 --> 22:26.553
It's my birthright, okay?
So what I think we're looking at here

22:26.637 --> 22:30.432
is something along the lines
of a 70/30 kind of split in my favor.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.268
Only because it is my money.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.521
Okay? So why don't we just cool out,
draw us up a little contract, something?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.148
Don't need to be fancy or anything.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.525
We can put it on a napkin
if that's what you want.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.068
Is that okay with you, Boyd?

22:42.153 --> 22:43.445
You know, my daddy,

22:44.405 --> 22:48.908
he always told me,
"Son, just 'cause you're paranoid,

22:49.702 --> 22:52.203
"that don't mean
that somebody ain't out to get you."

22:54.749 --> 22:57.751
Now, which one of you two assholes
is trying to set me up?

22:57.835 --> 23:00.128
Salt or pepper?

23:01.839 --> 23:02.839
Set...

23:04.091 --> 23:06.634
Yeah, I didn't think it was you, Dickie.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.389
There ain't any money
in that safe deposit box, is there, Errol?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.475
There ain't any of Mags' money at all.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.227
Well, I knew it when you came
through the front door, see?

23:16.312 --> 23:19.105
Why would you step up against Limehouse?

23:19.774 --> 23:24.235
'Cause even with all that money,
you ain't got nowhere else to go.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.822
So I'm gonna ask you one more time, son.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.159
What are you and Limehouse
trying to walk me into?

23:33.370 --> 23:34.996
To prison, Mr. Crowder.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.254
They're cutting you out.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.423
They're gonna run
with Dickie Bennett instead of you.

23:45.508 --> 23:49.302
I got no other play! Boyd's crew now.
This is the way it works.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.554
Boyd's a liar and a coward.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.974
The man who killed me
sipping ginger tea in his bar,

23:55.059 --> 23:57.435
and here you sit,
head hung like a piebald mule.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.978
You bite your tongue, Helen!

23:59.063 --> 24:01.272
He put you in here to rot

24:01.357 --> 24:03.900
while he takes what he likes
and leaves you the wishbone.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.362
Goddamn it, Helen. I said shut your mouth!

24:08.114 --> 24:09.364
Arlo!

24:11.033 --> 24:13.618
Did you take your meds today?

24:13.702 --> 24:15.161
I don't need them, Ava.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.040
I'm gonna get them anyway.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.670
You need to take care of business, Arlo.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.554
Arlo, get the phone!

24:33.347 --> 24:35.056
What's he doing?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.104
Arlo?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.485
<i>You've reached Ava Crowder.
You know what...</i>

24:47.570 --> 24:50.321
Not Arlo's house phone or Ava's cell.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.866
And you lost Quarles,
which leaves us with this shit right here.

24:52.950 --> 24:56.202
Quarles is taken care of.
But this ain't like Ava.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.914
Hey, Boyd.

25:01.667 --> 25:06.045
You think maybe you'd want to
just let me know more or less

25:06.130 --> 25:10.008
when you plan on killing me?

25:10.843 --> 25:15.180
I mean, I think I have maybe
a right to know that much at least.

25:15.264 --> 25:19.267
If Limehouse wanted me bound for jail,
I'm sure he had a word with law enforcement,

25:19.351 --> 25:24.189
and I'm guessing part of what he told them
was that you and Errol are still here.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.940
Am I right, Errol?

25:27.568 --> 25:31.738
So you rest easy, Dickie Bennett.
You ain't gonna die this night.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.699
I'll be back.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.452
Don't let these two out of your sight.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.876
You boys aren't dicking around, are you?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.545
- Just like you, we like to be prepared.
- Any word?

25:47.630 --> 25:50.256
Yeah, my man at the bar
says that Crowder just drove away.

25:50.341 --> 25:54.093
- You really think this is gonna go down?
- I hope so.

25:54.178 --> 25:59.057
'Cause if I'm missing my boy's T-ball game
for nothing, I'm gonna be pissed.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.728
Waiting. Waiting, waiting!
A little more waiting.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.104
Yeah, the waiting wouldn't be so hard

26:05.189 --> 26:08.733
if we had some decent food
or something to wait with.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.735
- Johnny?
- Have a pretzel.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.458
Where you going, Errol?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.877
Now, I can't abide you
pulling that pistol on me, Dickie.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.837
- Now, I warn you.
- Easy, easy.

26:29.922 --> 26:34.467
Now, don't you go warning me.
I don't think I can handle you warning me.

26:34.551 --> 26:39.097
What do you think you're gonna do
to back up your big warning there, Errol?

26:39.765 --> 26:41.349
Got something up your sleeve?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.896
I see! Yeah!
You got the silent treatment up your sleeve.

26:46.981 --> 26:49.440
That's your answer for everything,
isn't it, Errol?

26:49.525 --> 26:52.527
Dickie, put that gun down first,
and then we'll talk.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.239
Okay. All right. Let's talk. Let's talk.

26:57.658 --> 27:01.327
Now, you and Limehouse,
you're hiding my money.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.496
- Where?
- I told you. We done had that conversation.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.415
- I told you. I don't know.
- Yeah. Yeah, you told me.

27:05.499 --> 27:09.127
I remember what you told me, Errol.
I remember what you said. Yeah.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.130
"Dickie, it's okay.
Your money is right over here.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.048
"Oh, no, no. It ain't over here.
It's over there."

27:14.133 --> 27:15.133
So now I'm back to hearing,

27:15.217 --> 27:17.969
"Hey, ain't no money after all.
Ain't that a shame?"

27:18.053 --> 27:20.555
I'm gonna have to call me
some bullshit on that, Errol.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.682
I know my money ain't just gone,

27:22.766 --> 27:26.269
and I believe you know where it is,
and I believe you're gonna tell me where it is.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.230
On your mark, get set...

27:56.383 --> 27:58.009
Thank you.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.595
Dickie and Limehouse's man
Errol just left the bar.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.721
Where are they going?

28:01.805 --> 28:05.433
I got no damn idea,
but I'm gonna find out and let you know.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.729
Givens.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.315
What can I do for you?

28:12.983 --> 28:15.568
You still looking for that money?

28:50.396 --> 28:51.479
Ava!

28:53.357 --> 28:54.774
- Boyd!
- Ava!

28:55.484 --> 28:59.487
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Just get me out of here!

29:01.824 --> 29:03.074
What happened?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.576
- Where's Arlo?
- He's out of his mind.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.996
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey, Boyd, listen.</i>

29:09.081 --> 29:12.667
Dickie got the drop on me.
And he and Errol, they lit out.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.504
When I was coming to, I heard him say
something about the money. It's there.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.966
It's with some girl, Loretta, up in Lexington.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.430
That is a comfort. "Reasonably so."

29:25.514 --> 29:26.931
We've been driving around
damn near an hour.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.767
You haven't even been close to sure,
and now you're sure?

29:29.852 --> 29:31.352
Reasonably so.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.189
Turn it off. Let's get out.
Here we go. Come on.

29:35.274 --> 29:39.610
Attaboy. Up and out. Up and out.
Come on. Come on.

29:39.695 --> 29:43.114
Come on. If you would, please, sir.
There you go. If you would, please, sir.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.159
- What you want me to do?
- Put the key right in there.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.202
There you go. Come on.

29:48.871 --> 29:51.205
Right in there. If you would, please, sir,
one last time. There you go.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.875
- I can't get...
- Stretch right out. Watch your fingers.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.126
Here we go.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.712
- What the...
- There we go. Watch your fingers.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.006
Fingers and toes. Attaboy.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.842
- What the...
- Yeah. Good man.

30:17.733 --> 30:20.401
- How you doing, Dickie?
- Raylan.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.240
Well, well, well, here we are.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.494
Yeah, and you're here because...

30:29.578 --> 30:31.996
I know. You must be here
to help hand out my money.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.623
I got a trash bag in the car.

30:33.707 --> 30:39.170
I'm here to haul your ass back to prison
just like I promised the judge I would.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.840
But to be honest,
I didn't think it would happen so quickly.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.510
I mean, when was that?
A week ago Wednesday?

30:45.594 --> 30:50.348
And what is it you actually think
that you'd throw me back into prison for?

30:50.432 --> 30:53.601
'Cause I believe what you're looking at is...
I'm just... What am I doing?

30:53.685 --> 30:57.772
I'm coming to pay respects
to my baby adopted sister.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.398
- Is she around?
- With a loaded weapon?

30:59.483 --> 31:02.151
- Loretta!
- That's 42 months right there.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.445
That's keeping her safe right there
as far as I can tell.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.657
Keeping her safe?
Well, then why'd you break in?

31:07.741 --> 31:11.702
That door was way, way unlocked,
and we both know this.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.163
- That...
- That's another 20 months.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.206
Is that what that is?

31:15.290 --> 31:19.669
Not to mention the fella you got out there
in your trunk, kidnapped.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.256
That's about 60 months.
You're racking up quite a stay.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.675
The thing about the fella in the...

31:25.759 --> 31:27.593
Fella who may or may not be in the trunk,

31:27.678 --> 31:30.429
'cause he pretty much put himself in there
of his own doing.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.182
And if I happen to have a firearm upon me,

31:33.267 --> 31:37.687
it may have something to do with the fact
that there are one or two people in this world

31:37.771 --> 31:41.399
- who want to do me harm.
- You know what your trouble is?

31:41.483 --> 31:43.317
You keep thinking you're tough.

31:43.402 --> 31:47.071
So you're going back to prison
to be reminded you ain't.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.991
You're just stupid.

31:50.617 --> 31:54.453
You're just a stupid, craven,
hillbilly piece of shit.

31:54.538 --> 31:57.081
Hell, maybe getting tossed around
like a pool toy

31:57.165 --> 31:59.458
in the federal pen
is just the remedy you need.

31:59.543 --> 32:00.918
I'm not going back, Raylan.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.588
- You are.
- No. No, no. No.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.090
Let's try to look on the bright side, huh?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.509
At least you got your health.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.013
Dickie, what choice do I have?

32:32.034 --> 32:34.076
I appreciate the call.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.800
How'd Limehouse know
that they were gonna come after me?

32:49.885 --> 32:52.803
He had eyes on you
ever since Errol led Dickie off.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.598
Figured it was just a matter of time.

32:57.559 --> 32:58.976
So what are you gonna do?

32:59.061 --> 33:03.147
You understand this money we're looking for
has been used in criminal enterprises.

33:03.231 --> 33:06.233
Ain't any way to untangle
who it was rightfully taken from

33:06.318 --> 33:09.987
or any way to get it back to those people
if we ever did figure it out.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.990
If we recover it, we'd just put it
in a locker down in our basement

33:13.075 --> 33:15.076
until we can figure out
what the hell to do with it,

33:15.160 --> 33:16.494
but it's still my job to recover it.

33:16.578 --> 33:20.539
And if I wanted to, I could throw your ass
in detention and make you spill.

33:20.624 --> 33:24.168
Make you miss school, pull you out
of that foster family, the whole deal.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.587
- Is that what you're gonna do?
- What do you think?

33:26.672 --> 33:30.883
I think you should do what you got to do.
You won't hear me complaining either way.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.636
Limehouse and I came to an agreement.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.431
His side was alerting me
to Dickie coming for you.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.849
My side...

33:39.685 --> 33:43.229
I'm gonna respect Mags' decision.

33:45.732 --> 33:49.110
Well, I'm gonna respect your decision then.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.529
But I'll tell you something.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.740
I drive by your place and see
a brand new Lexus in your driveway

33:54.825 --> 33:57.576
or hear about Van Halen
playing your goddamn birthday party,

33:57.661 --> 34:00.454
I will drop down on you like a piano,
throw your ass in hock,

34:00.539 --> 34:04.250
and take every bit of that money with me.
Do you understand?

34:04.918 --> 34:06.252
Marshal,

34:07.003 --> 34:09.797
I strike you in any way as a Van Halen fan?

34:12.007 --> 34:13.634
Get out of here.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.806
Try staying out of trouble for once, huh?

34:40.411 --> 34:41.954
No, I'm good.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.456
The idea is to be better.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.507
Mr. Duffy.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.178
My favorite Wynn-Wynn situation.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.557
Are you smoking OxyContin
in my motor coach?

35:01.641 --> 35:03.976
I most certainly am.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.269
Do that in your own vehicle.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.732
- My car's not that comfortable.
- Robert.

35:11.359 --> 35:14.445
Limehouse told you where to wait.
Go wait there.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.071
Is Daddy getting mad?

35:16.156 --> 35:19.658
For once in your life,
do what has been asked of you.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.173
- Hello.
- Where are you, Mr. Quarles?

35:35.550 --> 35:40.304
Where you told me to be waiting out
for the big boom and a shitload of sirens.

35:40.388 --> 35:45.476
<i>Well, I'm afraid you can wait all night.
Mr. Crowder is not gonna hit that bank.</i>

35:45.560 --> 35:46.560
Why is that?

35:47.229 --> 35:49.855
Well, you can ask him when you see him.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.650
Am I going to be seeing him soon?

35:53.109 --> 35:56.111
You know, I didn't tell you
because you did not need to know,

35:56.196 --> 36:00.074
but that money he intended on stealing
from that bank belongs to me.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.202
<i>Now, the fact that he is no longer going for it</i>

36:03.286 --> 36:06.872
<i>does not mean
he can avoid paying for his intent.</i>

36:07.415 --> 36:11.001
Now, you told me
you're a man of special skills.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.921
And how can I be of service?

36:14.714 --> 36:17.049
I want you to show
Boyd Crowder them skills.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.553
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me, Mr. Quarles.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.932
Okay, what's in it for me?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.310
Your debt will be forgiven.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.274
And where is he?

36:33.358 --> 36:36.777
- He's at that little old bar.
- Okay.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.034
Did you get that?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.579
- The gist.
- Yeah. Good.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.498
You take your car, and I'll take mine.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.592
Now?

37:00.302 --> 37:04.305
No. Let's let him kill Crowder or at least try.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.561
Hey, Tom. Anything?

37:10.645 --> 37:14.315
Nothing blew up, and no bank got robbed.
Where are you?

37:14.399 --> 37:17.401
- Five out. Why?
- Well, my man outside Crowder's bar said

37:17.485 --> 37:19.862
someone who looked just like Quarles
just pulled into the parking lot.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.573
Not too many folks look like Robert Quarles.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.575
<i>I'll meet you up there.</i>

37:27.579 --> 37:30.205
What the hell is he doing here?
I thought you said it was taken care of.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.790
It was supposed to be.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.002
Goddamn it.

37:47.724 --> 37:48.933
What's he doing now?

37:49.017 --> 37:51.977
Well, it looks like
he's snorting shit up his nose.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.527
Shit, shit, shit!

38:03.114 --> 38:04.531
Mr. Quarles?

38:06.117 --> 38:10.204
I hate to ruin your party,
but what in the hell you doing here?

38:11.247 --> 38:13.123
Coming out slowly.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.667
Johnny.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.214
My hands are in the air.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.216
Now.

38:24.594 --> 38:26.845
And as you can see, I am unarmed.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.848
Well, as you can see, I'm not.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.173
Drop your weapon, or I will shoot.

39:03.758 --> 39:04.758
Drop it now.

39:18.982 --> 39:21.191
Tom? Officer down! Call for help!
