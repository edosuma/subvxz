There's no defense of that.

against Reddington

Elizabeth recently stole
a thumb drive

01:24.519 --> 01:26.390
from a safe deposit box

01:26.564 --> 01:28.305
We know that the drive
contained intel

01:28.479 --> 01:30.220

known as Rakitin.

A hacker who may be working
on behalf of the Russians.

thinks Rakitin was working

01:34.790 --> 01:36.052

the U.S. government.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.185
He was close to
finding out where

01:38.359 --> 01:40.187
when someone hacked into
his committee's computer

01:40.361 --> 01:41.971
and deleted all the files
they had on Rakitin.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.190
Do they know
who did it?

01:43.364 --> 01:44.626
They don't.
But I do.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.673

01:49.761 --> 01:51.676

01:51.850 --> 01:54.418

was funneling to Reddington.

Mr. Reddington is N-13.

but we don't know.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
And we won't know
until we find
the real Rakitin.

That's right.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.124

we have a lead.

To be precise,

02:09.390 --> 02:12.523
The thumb drive Keen stole
contained deep cover intel

stationed across the globe.

couldn't decrypt it.

The NSA didn't have
Reddington's thumbprint
on a scotch glass.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.667
You think one of these
agents is Rakitin?

02:25.841 --> 02:28.235
No. But their identities
were compromised by him,

02:28.409 --> 02:31.063
so I asked the House
intel chair

02:31.238 --> 02:34.415
how many people in the Office

to even know the identities
