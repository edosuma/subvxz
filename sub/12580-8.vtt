00:34.200 --> 00:36.100
Enjoy that new Char King, Earl.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.137
I gotta say,
I really appreciate your business.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.833
Forget him, Hank. He's chump change.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.644
I got a lead on a new client so big...

00:46.746 --> 00:49.340
it'll put all my bastard sons
through college.

00:49.516 --> 00:53.850
-The Renaissance Faire's in town.
-""Hear ye! Hear ye! ""

00:54.254 --> 00:55.482
With all due respect, sir...

00:55.588 --> 00:58.785
do we really want propane mixed up
in this sort of thing?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.258
Last year I would have said, ""Hell, no! ""

01:01.461 --> 01:03.053
But it's a new normal, Hank.

01:03.163 --> 01:04.790
You want a Christmas bonus this year...

01:04.897 --> 01:07.765
you sell them leotards
every gallon you can!

01:14.140 --> 01:15.368
Who goes there?

01:15.475 --> 01:18.638
Hank Hill, Assistant Manager,
Strickland Propane.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.771
I'm here to talk to a Philip Motzinger.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.906
You mean King Philip.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.345
But begging your pardon...

01:25.452 --> 01:28.979
you cannot pass in that horseless carriage
and manner of dress...

01:29.155 --> 01:33.319
for they do not exist in our year, 1590.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.162
Why don't you cut the goofy talk
and just open the gate?

01:38.031 --> 01:40.499
Look, the Alamo Beer guy
was cool about it.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.140
There was a lover aid his lass

01:56.249 --> 01:59.548
with a hey aid a ho aid a hey ioiiy-io

01:59.652 --> 02:02.314
-Prithee, join me.
-Just drive the cart.

02:04.257 --> 02:08.318
King Philip, my liege, I bring a merchant
who wishes to display his wares.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.762
Hank Hill, Strickland Propane.

02:11.764 --> 02:14.289
So you are keeper of the flame.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.435
Assistant keeper of the flame.

02:17.637 --> 02:21.630
Our kingdom is accepting bids
from members of your guild.

02:21.808 --> 02:25.904
We require 1,000 stone a week
of your magic gas.

02:26.045 --> 02:29.139
A stone is, in your native tongue, a gallon.

02:29.249 --> 02:33.549
1,000 gallons a week?
What are you fellows doing with it?

02:46.466 --> 02:49.458
That is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen...

02:50.236 --> 02:51.601
I tell ye what.

02:55.475 --> 02:59.002
Honest to God, he did it just like this.
It was crazy.

02:59.112 --> 03:03.242
Men in the Renaissance period often shook
wrist to wrist to check for daggers...

03:03.349 --> 03:05.840
and because they did not use toilet paper.

03:06.152 --> 03:09.644
We gotta go!
I haven't had a caramel apple in weeks!

03:10.356 --> 03:12.153
I've never seen anything like it.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.591
Everyone was dressed up
and playing make-believe.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.728
That part was asinine. But, boy!

03:17.830 --> 03:22.665
They got a dragon that burns
1,000 gallons of propane a week.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.696
Yep, you heard me. A week.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.733
If I can close this deal, I can get us
that second sink in the bathroom.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.303
No more bumping heads when we brush.

03:33.112 --> 03:36.912
That would be paradise. But.... But wait.

03:37.483 --> 03:41.010
We agreed I am saving up for the sink
with my notary fees.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.953
-Well, that should cover the sales tax.
-But I'm--

03:45.058 --> 03:48.323
Just don't leave your hair in it.
That's the only payment I need.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.296
Okay, Luanne, since you're older...

03:55.401 --> 03:58.131
I'm putting you in charge
of the spending money.

03:58.438 --> 04:00.906
Spend it any way you want
with three rules.

04:01.074 --> 04:04.202
No tights, tassels, or skirts on the boy.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.508
Oh, and no bells. Have fun.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.917
It says right here, ""one dollar discount
with period costume.""

04:15.021 --> 04:17.922
Well, I'm from the future,
and the future is a period.

04:18.024 --> 04:22.051
Ergo, this is a period costume! Period!

04:23.763 --> 04:25.663
Good morrow, all.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.598
Hey, there, sire.

04:28.901 --> 04:33.361
I'd like you to meet my lady, Lady Peggy.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.033
Delighted.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.641
Well, nice to meet you, Phil.

04:39.746 --> 04:43.842
Now, I'm not a Renaissance expert,
but I did substitute-teach Chapter 6 in...

04:43.950 --> 04:45.508
The World oi Parade,,,

04:45.618 --> 04:49.850
and let me tell you, you have kept
your historical inaccuracies to a minimum.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.359
What inaccuracies dost thy mean?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.758
I think you meant ""dost thou mean.""

04:58.131 --> 05:00.531
And your British accent
is really, really close.

05:03.469 --> 05:07.872
Well, now that you've met my wife,
maybe I should meet your propane needs.

05:08.207 --> 05:11.540
We should not discuss matters of trade
in the presence of the fairer sex.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.613
-Let's away!
-Oh, yeah, sure.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.073
Peggy, I'm gonna ""away""
with King Motzinger.

05:18.184 --> 05:20.550
Why don't you away...away.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.190
And the ""E"" stands for ""Economical.""

05:26.292 --> 05:30.058
Some people think the ""E"" stands for
""Even-Burning,"" but it doesn't.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.861
-So do we have your business?
-Hey, dude, it's the king.

05:34.834 --> 05:39.100
We wage war on France on the morrow!

05:39.372 --> 05:40.634
That is so gay.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.374
Prince Thatherton of Thatherton Fuels...

05:46.479 --> 05:50.848
was here last eve pledging on his honor
to undersell you by 10%%.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.579
The difference between
Strickland Propane and Thatherton Fuels...

05:55.855 --> 05:59.222
besides Thatherton's lack of focus,
is service.

05:59.659 --> 06:02.492
I do demand proper service.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.222
Then Strickland Propane
is the place for you.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.058
This is mead! I said grog!

06:09.168 --> 06:11.159
-I'm sorry. I--
-Away!

06:12.138 --> 06:14.732
A good wench is so hard to find.

06:15.308 --> 06:18.277
You're fortunate. Yours seems sturdy.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.006
If I had her in my employ...

06:21.114 --> 06:24.709
it would solidify the bond
between our two kingdoms.

06:25.818 --> 06:29.584
Peggy is not an actual employee
of Strickland Propane.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.950
But, at Strickland Propane, our motto is...

06:34.327 --> 06:37.387
""lf you have a problem, tell us what it is...

06:37.730 --> 06:41.598
""and we will try to take care of it
as soon as we can.""

06:42.769 --> 06:44.703
Oh, wait, wait. Have you already started?

06:44.804 --> 06:48.433
Because I'm thinking of going back
to ""Number One Mom.""

06:50.042 --> 06:53.603
Hey, Peggy. Guess who wants you
to work in his kingdom?

06:54.147 --> 06:56.513
The king. How about that, huh?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.282
Now you actually could
help me get that sink.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.148
Oh, I could. But will l?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.949
Sure! We'll be a great team.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.456
Side by side, like our double sinks.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.095
-King Philip, sir?
-How now, gas man?

07:13.232 --> 07:14.699
Pretty good, thanks.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.365
My wife Peggy is ready
to serve the kingdom.

07:18.671 --> 07:22.664
I am a Renaissance woman.
This is a Renaissance Faire.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.710
-We are a perfect fit.
-Delightful.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.105
I've got just the hole for this peg.

07:29.215 --> 07:32.844
Hear ye, hear ye, by order of King Philip...

07:32.952 --> 07:36.217
for the crime of offering her own opinion...

07:36.322 --> 07:40.691
this impudent wench has been sentenced
to one hour in the stocks.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.392
Hoist your fruit, good men.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.895
[Men laughing]

07:48.568 --> 07:51.298
Okay, Phil. Where do I start?

07:59.779 --> 08:01.747
King Philip sent us here
about a job for my wife.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.846
I'm not saying it has to be a good job.

08:04.951 --> 08:08.079
But, again, we were referred by the king.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.156
All right, bear with me a sec.
This thing is so freaking slow.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.725
I would make
an excellent wandering minstrel.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.953
If I can play guitar on the StairMaster...

08:16.062 --> 08:18.326
I certainly can do it while wandering.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.997
No, see, you're a woman.
Other than the yard-long margaritas...

08:22.101 --> 08:24.695
we're pretty strict
about historical accuracy.

08:24.904 --> 08:28.032
You're pretty much looking at
cleaning wench, stable wench...

08:28.140 --> 08:29.869
or butter-churning wench.

08:30.009 --> 08:34.275
Are you sure you don't have any openings
for a queen? Warrior princess?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.940
No. I can go over the wenches again.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.976
Is cleaning wench
the highest-ranking wench?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.484
Highest?

08:45.124 --> 08:47.217
Oh, yes.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.699
When a tour comes by, clean the rug
by beating the dirt out of it.

08:53.799 --> 08:57.929
When the tour leaves,
dirty the rug by sprinkling dirt on it.

08:58.037 --> 09:02.497
Well, as back-to-back-to-back
Substitute Teacher of the Year...

09:02.608 --> 09:05.941
I may look far too intelligent
to be a cleaning wench.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.007
I just hope people buy it.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.383
I am sweating like a horse here.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.360
Well, what happened to you?

09:22.461 --> 09:25.430
I was punished
for my sloth and impertinence.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.021
Why are you talking like that?

09:28.301 --> 09:31.668
Honey, you don't want the king
to catch you breaking character.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.797
Once he put me on stable duty
for humming an Elvis song.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.568
TOUR GUlDE: Follow me, fair visitors.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.839
To our tasks, everyone!
Villagers approach.

09:39.946 --> 09:43.211
I hope you enjoyed
the stable and the sty.

09:43.516 --> 09:47.816
We now move on to some more comely
beasts of burden, the wenches.

09:48.020 --> 09:51.319
Good morrow, everyone.
I am beating a rug.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.621
A very important job,
for castles were oft drafty and--

09:54.727 --> 09:59.357
-Wench, whom addressed thee?
-I addressed myself.

09:59.665 --> 10:03.123
Since there was no such thing
as a vacuum cleaner in the Middle Ages--

10:03.235 --> 10:05.465
What speak you of vacuum cleaner?

10:05.571 --> 10:08.870
-Peggy, hold thine tongue!
-Oh, oh, oh, right, right, right.

10:08.975 --> 10:13.708
In the future,
they will invent a magical sucking device...

10:13.813 --> 10:16.338
to free women from household drudgery!

10:17.383 --> 10:21.114
If thou can foretell the future,
perhaps thou art a witch!

10:21.220 --> 10:25.213
She is no witch, milord.
Merely tetched in the head from the sun.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.552
She's a witch!

10:26.659 --> 10:28.889
-Witch! Witch!
-Witch!

10:29.729 --> 10:31.162
[Bugle blowing]

10:31.831 --> 10:35.028
How now? Is there unrest in my kingdom?

10:35.134 --> 10:36.465
She's a witch!

10:36.569 --> 10:40.903
Well, I guess if they burn you at the stake,
they'll be using my propane.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.641
You'll find it burns witches
cleanly and evenly...

10:44.744 --> 10:47.872
and at a fraction of the cost of natural gas.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.774
You know, this cleaning-wench thing
isn't really doing it for me.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.252
If her arms worked
as hard as her serpent's tongue...

10:55.354 --> 10:58.152
there would be nary
a speck of dust in the kingdom.

11:09.201 --> 11:10.395
[Sighing with relief]

11:12.104 --> 11:15.164
This is not
what nature intended for my implants.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.300
That fat Merlin
finished all the chicken wings.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.741
Why do the wenches
always get the last lunch break?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.041
Because Philip is an ass.

11:23.482 --> 11:26.315
Speaking of which,
he grabbed mine again this morning.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.650
But he's your boss.
That is sexual harassment.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.152
Well, King Philip says
that's all just tomfoolery.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.718
You know, it's okay to humiliate me
when I'm Becky, the butter-churner...

11:37.830 --> 11:39.889
but not when I'm Becky, the person.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.832
-Oh, by the way, my name's Becky.
-Peggy Hill, rug wench.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.864
You know, maybe
he just doesn't have good people skills.

11:46.972 --> 11:48.337
You know, sometimes I don't.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.376
See Brandon over there?
He started here a year ago.

11:51.644 --> 11:53.578
Makes twice as much as me.

11:55.247 --> 11:56.339
You know what?

11:56.449 --> 12:00.112
As the highest-ranking wench,
maybe I should talk to the king.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.343
It is time we rewrote history.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.756
Hey, Philip, you got a second?

12:08.961 --> 12:10.553
Mr. Motzinger?

12:12.198 --> 12:14.860
-King Philip?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.395
I was just counting my treasure
from the Americas.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.528
What is the reason for this interruption?

12:19.638 --> 12:23.335
One of the girls got out her laptop
and we went on some labor websites....

12:23.442 --> 12:27.572
-""Laptop""?
-Oh, come on. This is serious.

12:27.780 --> 12:31.546
You have women working more than
40 hours a week without overtime.

12:31.650 --> 12:35.017
There is no sanitary-napkin dispenser
in the ladies' Porta-John.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.387
And are you familiar with the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993?

12:39.525 --> 12:43.052
How could I be? It is but 1590.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.960
Why don't you drop the act
and you explain to me...

12:46.065 --> 12:50.832
why the wenches make 70 cents on the
dollar and the village idiot gets full dental?

12:50.970 --> 12:54.565
You are but a woman,
and I have given you enough of my time!

12:54.673 --> 12:55.662
Begone!

13:01.914 --> 13:06.214
God dangit! That's my third pair
of these goddang tights today.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.180
At least you get to wear tights.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.723
These are my work stockings.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.819
How do you ladies put up with this?

13:14.260 --> 13:16.751
Well, we put up
with a lot more than that, Hank.

13:16.862 --> 13:19.387
Just now,
when I was complaining to King Philip--

13:19.498 --> 13:21.295
Whoa, whoa! Complaining? No.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.265
The customer complains,
not the gas merchant's wench.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.429
-You're gonna skunk the deal.
-But I just--

13:26.539 --> 13:30.600
Look, if the king gives you a hard time,
come see me, and I'll handle it.

13:30.776 --> 13:35.406
-Whatever you do, don't open your mouth.
-I can fight my own battles.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.015
Mouth!

13:45.057 --> 13:47.355
If King Philip isn't ready
for the Age of Reason...

13:47.459 --> 13:51.953
we will dust off a Dark Ages classic,
the peasant revolt!

13:52.298 --> 13:56.234
-Everyone grab a tomato!
-Are you crazy? You'll get us all fired!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.860
He can't fire all of us.
Who will do the laundry, huh?

13:58.971 --> 14:00.768
The blacksmith? He's filthy!

14:00.873 --> 14:04.900
This Faire will grind to a halt, and
Philip will be forced to meet our demands.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.740
Look, I can't take any chances.
I have a daughter...

14:07.847 --> 14:10.680
and she needs a prom dress. And it has
to be the one from the magazine...

14:10.783 --> 14:12.648
or all the other girls will make fun of her!

14:12.751 --> 14:15.515
Aren't you willing to risk
this demeaning job today...

14:15.621 --> 14:18.215
to give your daughter
a brighter tomorrow?

14:18.324 --> 14:19.985
Or whenever her prom is?

14:20.726 --> 14:22.091
[Bugle blowing]

14:22.728 --> 14:27.222
Hear ye. Hear ye.
All rise for the royal procession.

14:27.533 --> 14:32.232
-I hand you tomatoes of freedom!
-Give me a firm one!

14:35.741 --> 14:39.472
What a fine day for a Faire it is!

14:46.919 --> 14:49.285
Welcome to my kingdom.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.353
It's now or never! Now!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.690
Come on, throw!

15:02.735 --> 15:03.827
I'm sorry.

15:05.804 --> 15:10.571
The One-Wench Rebellion of 1590
has been quashed!

15:10.876 --> 15:11.843
HANK: Peggy?

15:13.779 --> 15:15.110
Well, I'm sorry, Hank.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.181
I guess everyone here likes things
the way they are.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.215
I'll go back to beating the rug now.

15:20.319 --> 15:21.684
I wonder, Madam...

15:21.887 --> 15:26.017
if I can expect the same impertinence
from your husband's propanery...

15:26.158 --> 15:29.525
that I have come to expect from you.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.822
-Please, Hank had nothing to do with this.
-Guards!

15:33.098 --> 15:36.590
Seize this wench
and take her to the stocks!

15:38.103 --> 15:40.162
What are you doing?
Take your hands off her!

15:40.272 --> 15:43.366
No, no. It's okay, Hank. I'm not here.

15:43.475 --> 15:46.410
I'm in our bathroom over my own sink.

15:46.512 --> 15:50.608
-And I'm flossing, Hank. I'm flossing.
-Oh!

15:55.187 --> 15:57.621
Okay, that's it. Show's over.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.354
Hank, stop! You'll lose the account.

16:00.459 --> 16:04.190
Listen to your shrew.
In her nagging, there is wisdom.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.094
Dangit! There are more important things
than a sale!

16:07.199 --> 16:10.532
You take off that crown!
I'm kicking your ass!

16:10.636 --> 16:14.299
Oh, you demand satisfaction? Fine.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.838
-Then we shall joust by day's end!
-Say huh?

16:18.944 --> 16:21.139
If you are able to tilt me off my steed...

16:21.246 --> 16:25.546
then I will apologize to you and yon hag
and purchase your gas.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.509
But if I should send thou
tumbling to the dirt...

16:29.655 --> 16:34.149
then you and your gas
will be banished from the kingdom.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.523
But not before your wif...

16:36.628 --> 16:40.223
cleans the man-sweat from my blouse.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.832
Fine! You are in
for the joust of your life, mister!

16:45.104 --> 16:47.834
Yep, the joust of your life.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.177
-Yep.
-Yep.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.382
Bleep. Yeah, you're gonna get killed, Hank.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.819
I'd offer to help,
but the prime directive forbids me...

17:05.924 --> 17:08.085
from altering the course of history.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.752
If I do, you will win,
but the universe will lose...

17:10.863 --> 17:13.763
and who wants that? Besides you.

17:13.932 --> 17:17.891
No chump in a velvet costume
is ever kicking my ass.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.771
Hank, I don't need to tell you
how important this joust is, do l?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.866
Of course not. My wife's honor is at stake.

17:25.243 --> 17:26.211
Yes, I do.

17:26.310 --> 17:30.213
Hank, I already made my ""in your face""
call to Thatherton!

17:30.315 --> 17:31.748
Don't muck this up!

17:35.654 --> 17:37.622
And if Hank hadn't been there
to defend me...

17:37.723 --> 17:39.691
I might still be in the stocks.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.089
And towards the end there,
they were throwing potatoes.

17:42.194 --> 17:45.288
Which I had to tell them
was more historically accurate.

17:45.798 --> 17:46.765
My mouth.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.294
What do you think gonna happen
after the joust?

17:49.401 --> 17:52.393
You know, when Hank is killed,
with Peggy?

17:52.504 --> 17:53.630
In the Middle Ages...

17:53.739 --> 17:57.300
there was an orderly procedure
for the dispensation of the wife.

17:57.443 --> 18:00.105
Unlike in today's gynocracy.

18:00.345 --> 18:04.577
Ownership goes from the son
to the dog to the best friend.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.914
Bobby's too young, Ladybird's too old,
I already own a wife...

18:08.020 --> 18:11.922
Boomhauer doesn't have the time.
So, Bill, this could be your in.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.925
Don't worry, Peggy. I'll take care of you.

18:15.060 --> 18:18.223
That is as unnecessary as it is repulsive.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.423
-Peggy Hill can take care of herself.
-Oh, boy!

18:22.668 --> 18:25.262
You're gonna have your hands full
with this one, Bill.

18:25.737 --> 18:29.264
-Next item, Hank's lawnmower.
-Yo, man. I got dibs on it.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.433
Oh, you're all a bunch of morons!

18:47.392 --> 18:51.158
I think you should know
I've never jousted before.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.397
-Or ridden a horse.
-He'll do most of the work.

18:54.500 --> 18:58.266
Now, if he bucks you, make sure to
cover your neck and your testicles.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.738
The joust is commencing!
The joust is commencing!

19:18.290 --> 19:19.814
Go, Hank!

19:20.526 --> 19:21.823
Go, Dad!

19:21.927 --> 19:23.554
-Bobby!
-Oh!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.832
Tell me, peasant...

20:04.403 --> 20:07.304
how does it feel to have lost the joust,
your wench's honor...

20:07.406 --> 20:11.467
and the propane account
in one mighty thrust of my lance?

20:11.610 --> 20:13.874
It's a bitter taste, I'm sure.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.879
And ye shall savor it...

20:15.981 --> 20:19.849
for seven score fortnights anon!

20:20.419 --> 20:21.386
[Horse neighing]

20:28.493 --> 20:29.460
Huh?

20:42.341 --> 20:44.309
Hey, King Make-Believe!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.505
You just got beat by a girl.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.781
-Yeah! All right, Mom!
-Hooray!

20:56.521 --> 21:00.480
Help me to my feet,
you gaggle of magpies!

21:01.393 --> 21:05.420
-What hand you me?
-It's a lawsuit, honey.

21:05.897 --> 21:08.957
""Department of Labor, OSHA...

21:09.067 --> 21:12.434
""Texas Workforce Commission""?

21:15.540 --> 21:18.976
Crap! I'm gonna lose my Faire.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.205
I don't want to go back
to selling real estate.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.145
We did it, Peggy.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.881
Well, I just wish
I'd been born 500 years ago.

21:30.989 --> 21:34.390
I could have single-handedly saved
womankind forever.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.552
-I helped, too, you know.
-Yes, Hank.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.859
Everybody helped.
Just try not to fall off the horse this time.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.728
The prime directive has been breached!

21:41.833 --> 21:44.267
Women's liberation
has happened too soon!

21:44.369 --> 21:46.234
I must warn the future!

21:47.839 --> 21:50.740
Take me with you! I hate it here.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.080
PHlLlP: How iow, gas mai?
