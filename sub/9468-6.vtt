01:23.828 --> 01:25.620
Animals.

01:50.355 --> 01:53.983
Sheriff Sworn.
Olivia Godfrey here.

01:54.025 --> 01:56.986
Mm? Yes, yes, quite. And yours?

01:57.028 --> 02:00.781
Well, I hate to be a bother,
but I've recently heard reports

02:00.822 --> 02:04.117
of trespassers
around the mill building--

02:04.159 --> 02:06.620
reports just confirmed.

02:06.662 --> 02:09.663
Urban explorers
or some such nonsense.

02:11.667 --> 02:15.294
What I'm asking for, Sheriff,
are some extra patrols.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.632
Someone may get hurt.

02:18.674 --> 02:21.508
Yes, that would be fine.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.294
What if Destiny was wrong?

03:36.336 --> 03:38.919
What if the invitation was in
Willoughby's car? Or her purse?

03:38.961 --> 03:43.383
- What if the moon hits your eye?
- What if it was an e-vite?

03:43.425 --> 03:45.550
Then the Order of the Dragon
will have to find

03:45.592 --> 03:47.930
- a new adventure.
- Suck a bag of dicks!

03:47.972 --> 03:49.931
I never called us
the Order of the Dragon.

03:49.973 --> 03:52.224
Yup.

03:55.645 --> 03:57.646
What's with this guy?

03:59.650 --> 04:03.277
I don't know.
He's just old.

04:03.319 --> 04:04.905
Gross.

04:04.947 --> 04:07.782
How old's your mom, anyway?

04:07.824 --> 04:10.328
Why don't you ask her that?

04:18.711 --> 04:20.795
What if they don't leave?

04:20.838 --> 04:23.966
What if we stop beginning
sentences with those two words?

04:24.007 --> 04:25.509
Hm?

04:30.514 --> 04:32.516
Fuck Penrose.

04:43.403 --> 04:47.281
Hey! We were gonna wait
till they left.

04:47.322 --> 04:49.492
Roman!

04:49.533 --> 04:51.536
Asshole. What the fuck?

04:58.334 --> 04:59.793
Can I help you?

04:59.834 --> 05:02.213
Mr. Willoughby.
We're here about Lisa.

05:02.254 --> 05:04.257
This isn't a good time.

05:04.298 --> 05:06.466
Mr. Willoughby.

05:06.509 --> 05:08.511
You're exhausted.

05:11.264 --> 05:13.307
You should really take a nap.

05:26.237 --> 05:27.696
In case you were wondering,

05:27.737 --> 05:29.990
cops call this shit
breaking and entering.

05:30.031 --> 05:31.992
Was it ever gonna be
anything else?

05:32.033 --> 05:34.826
I'm just saying that there's
the right way

05:34.870 --> 05:37.372
and then there's the foolish
way. Don't ever do it

05:37.415 --> 05:39.375
that way again.

05:39.415 --> 05:41.834
- You're a fucked way.
- Yeah.

05:47.341 --> 05:50.470
Does that hurt?

05:50.511 --> 05:52.471
You wouldn't notice
if a bus hit you.

05:54.348 --> 05:56.850
All right, let's just do this
and get out of here.

06:13.451 --> 06:15.286
In here.

06:35.264 --> 06:36.764
Find anything?

06:36.807 --> 06:39.684
Not yet. You?

06:39.725 --> 06:42.896
Ohhh.

06:42.937 --> 06:45.899
- Hippity-hop.
- Nice.

06:55.535 --> 06:56.994
Cool.

06:57.036 --> 06:59.413
Roman Godfrey in my house.

06:59.454 --> 07:04.627
Um...

07:04.668 --> 07:09.048
We're looking for some mail
that might have come for Lisa.

07:09.088 --> 07:11.591
Why?

07:11.634 --> 07:14.802
We think someone might have
killed her.

07:14.845 --> 07:16.762
Oh. Someone like you.

07:16.805 --> 07:18.598
TouchÃ©.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.100
Shut the fuck up--

07:20.141 --> 07:22.853
- Are you the ones
that dug up my sister?

07:22.894 --> 07:25.314
I don't care.
Like that's so much worse

07:25.355 --> 07:27.858
than what already happens to you
when you die?

07:37.660 --> 07:40.370
Mom's taking Gary
to be put down.

07:40.413 --> 07:44.040
- What?
- Gary.

07:44.083 --> 07:48.379
Mom can't handle
having a dog around.

07:48.420 --> 07:51.632
And Dad, he can't handle the thought
of having the dog Lisa loved

07:51.673 --> 07:54.677
so much being with new owners.

07:54.718 --> 07:58.264
Seems like a bit much for a
Boston terrier, don't you think?

07:58.305 --> 08:00.139
It does.

08:00.182 --> 08:02.100
You guys didn't look

08:02.141 --> 08:03.935
over here.

08:06.230 --> 08:09.064
Is this what you're looking for?
I found it

08:09.108 --> 08:12.235
in Lisa's sock drawer when I was
looking for leggings.

08:12.278 --> 08:16.115
I thought it was an invitation to a
rave, so I begged her to take me,

08:16.156 --> 08:18.824
but she wouldn't.

08:18.867 --> 08:20.745
So I looked at her,

08:20.786 --> 08:23.581
so fucking pretty,

08:23.622 --> 08:28.502
and I said that I hope
she ends up in a dumpster.

08:28.543 --> 08:31.754
OK.

08:31.797 --> 08:33.758
I already showed it
to my parents.

08:33.798 --> 08:37.384
They just got pissed. They'd rather
believe she was killed by an animal.

08:37.427 --> 08:39.177
It's easier,

08:39.221 --> 08:41.181
I guess.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.142
"Fun, fun, fun."

08:43.182 --> 08:45.144
What the hell is Castle

08:45.183 --> 08:46.937
Godfrey?

08:46.979 --> 08:51.066
The mill. That's what people
call the old steel mill.

08:51.106 --> 08:54.067
All right, thanks. This is... this
is very helpful. We should go.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.153
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Why do you care

08:56.196 --> 08:58.197
who did this? Why are you
looking for him?

08:58.240 --> 09:00.200
'Cause when we find him,

09:00.240 --> 09:02.495
he's going to be joining Gary.

09:14.465 --> 09:18.177
I need to know if you're taking
this as seriously as I am.

09:18.216 --> 09:20.177
My name is on this.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.181
This thing put my name on this.

09:22.221 --> 09:24.767
Your family's name.

09:24.807 --> 09:28.019
This matters to me as much
as it matters to you.

09:28.061 --> 09:31.816
But if you end up in jail,
you better reconsider that hair.

09:31.855 --> 09:33.817
I'm just saying.

09:33.859 --> 09:36.985
I'll just point 'em
towards your lips.

09:37.028 --> 09:38.779
Oh.

09:43.033 --> 09:45.788
Do you believe everything
happens for a reason?

09:45.830 --> 09:49.500
Man, I try not
to fuckin' think about it.

09:57.383 --> 10:00.134
What's up?

10:00.177 --> 10:02.052
Oh, Lynda.

10:02.095 --> 10:04.139
She needs some help
back at home.

10:04.181 --> 10:06.767
Water heater or some shit.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.812
We'll reconvene?
Go to the mill later?

10:12.605 --> 10:14.649
What, is that a problem?

10:16.692 --> 10:18.696
Man's gotta do...

10:21.865 --> 10:24.576
Yeah, Tyler's gonna
love that white streak.

10:24.618 --> 10:26.662
We gotta figure this hair out
for your date tonight.

10:26.702 --> 10:28.663
It'll be fine. We're just
going to the movies.

10:28.706 --> 10:33.836
That shit just keeps coming back.
It's like retarded zombie hair.

10:33.878 --> 10:37.004
I think your hair's
really pretty the way it is.

10:37.047 --> 10:40.926
It's what's different about you
that's gonna make him remember you.

10:40.966 --> 10:42.845
You've already got

10:42.885 --> 10:46.807
all kinds of mystery.
Seriously.

10:46.849 --> 10:48.893
That's just
my professional opinion.

10:48.932 --> 10:51.186
- What.
- Ever.

10:51.226 --> 10:53.522
Wow. OK.

10:53.562 --> 10:55.524
Look...

10:55.566 --> 10:58.817
I'm-I'm sorry, but...
do you really not know

10:58.860 --> 11:01.278
how pretty you are?

11:01.321 --> 11:04.865
The world already has two
of them.

11:04.908 --> 11:07.033
We really don't need a third.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.163
What a bitch.

11:11.206 --> 11:15.375
Ugh. Do their tramp stamps
match too?

11:15.418 --> 11:19.172
- Did that cunt just say that?
- That cunt just totally said that.

11:21.091 --> 11:24.552
One for sorrow, two for joy,

11:24.595 --> 11:30.475
three for girl, four for boy,
five for silver,

11:30.517 --> 11:36.605
six for gold, seven for a secret
never to be...

11:36.649 --> 11:39.067
told.

11:42.153 --> 11:44.697
It's OK, it's OK. It's OK.

11:44.740 --> 11:49.662
She's very... It's all right,
she's very nice.

12:02.215 --> 12:05.344
Shelley, darling, come on.

12:05.384 --> 12:06.846
Psst!

12:06.885 --> 12:09.431
- It's OK.
- Remember, Shelley,

12:09.471 --> 12:12.475
the cruelty of children is
easily ignored.

12:12.518 --> 12:15.687
I finally tracked it down
at UT--

12:15.729 --> 12:19.441
only college in the world with
a library of Romany studies.

12:19.481 --> 12:22.778
Guess it's racist to call them
gypsies. What isn't these days?

12:22.820 --> 12:26.279
- Mm.
- Find what you're looking for?

12:28.993 --> 12:31.451
Rarely.

12:31.495 --> 12:34.456
Well, thank you for your...

12:34.498 --> 12:37.000
efforts.

12:41.043 --> 12:42.798
Thank you.

12:48.846 --> 12:51.306
So, I did some more digging.

12:51.346 --> 12:54.307
I asked my dad like a million
questions about Aunt Olivia--

12:54.350 --> 12:57.479
- Whoa, whoa. What is that?

12:57.519 --> 13:01.942
Peanut butter and lime yogurt mixed
together with gummy bears and extra M&Ms.

13:01.984 --> 13:03.985
Bite?

13:06.321 --> 13:09.950
Screw it, I say.
Bring on the maternity pants.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.619
I mean, I don't know
what picture of Dorian Gray

13:12.659 --> 13:16.331
you have to hide away for your butt to
look as good as Olivia's at her age.

13:16.373 --> 13:18.331
Can you imagine?

13:18.375 --> 13:21.961
Besides, abstinence is
way overrated.

13:23.964 --> 13:26.090
What, you don't think
she's hot?

13:26.130 --> 13:29.469
Not my type.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.971
And he's a liar.

13:33.014 --> 13:37.394
Anyway, when Olivia was
my dad's patient...

13:37.436 --> 13:41.065
- What?
- Didn't say anything.

13:41.105 --> 13:46.317
OK. Well, I got the sense
she had some major problems

13:46.360 --> 13:50.240
before Roman was born--
after the first baby.

13:50.282 --> 13:53.619
There was a girl
before Roman and Shelley.

13:53.658 --> 13:57.456
Her name was Juliet.
She died as an infant.

13:57.495 --> 13:59.041
Died how?

14:02.461 --> 14:04.754
Uh, off topic. Go on.

14:04.797 --> 14:10.427
But in the end it was JR
who totally lost his grip.

14:10.469 --> 14:13.346
I guess he made some pretty wild
accusations about her.

14:13.388 --> 14:15.514
Like what?

14:15.557 --> 14:19.726
Dad wouldn't say. Must have been
some serious crazy-person stuff.

14:19.769 --> 14:22.730
There was a suicide letter too.

14:22.773 --> 14:25.524
They found it the next day.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.072
Do you have any idea
what it might have said?

14:30.114 --> 14:32.950
I don't know.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.619
I got from the look on his face
that it was time to change

14:35.659 --> 14:37.620
the subject.

14:37.663 --> 14:40.124
Godfreys have that look down.

14:40.163 --> 14:41.917
Yep. Mm-hmm.

14:45.504 --> 14:49.298
How much do you think Roman knows
about where Olivia came from?

14:49.341 --> 14:52.302
Isn't that a better question
to ask Roman?

14:52.344 --> 14:55.053
I thought you two were...
whatever it is that you

14:55.096 --> 14:57.099
call that you're doing.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.475
You keep thinkin', Butch.

15:00.519 --> 15:04.355
It's what you're good at.

15:04.397 --> 15:06.984
So, I'm thinking
the Rag & Bone scuba skinnies

15:07.024 --> 15:08.652
with, like, a tunic top.

15:08.692 --> 15:12.822
Yeah, that definitely brands
earthy yet sorta sexy. Mm-hmm.

15:12.865 --> 15:14.322
Yo.

15:14.365 --> 15:17.369
Attention deficit?

15:17.408 --> 15:19.327
Guys. Baby bump

15:19.370 --> 15:21.623
and teen wolf.

15:21.663 --> 15:24.457
Better check that fetus for
Lyme ticks is all I'm saying.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.461
Or kennel cough.

15:26.503 --> 15:28.172
Mm, I think

15:28.211 --> 15:30.755
I'm developing...
reflux disease.

15:30.798 --> 15:34.259
- I have to meet my grandmother
across the road. - Wait, what?

15:34.302 --> 15:36.260
- Where are you going?
- You still have to try on...

15:36.302 --> 15:38.389
- Christina!
- Don't you know them?

15:38.431 --> 15:40.392
What--

15:40.432 --> 15:42.644
- What are we gonna do with her?
- I don't--

15:42.686 --> 15:45.147
- Oh, they just think
I'm a werewolf too.

15:45.187 --> 15:47.856
People suck.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.993
Such a talent.

15:58.033 --> 16:01.327
His French verse
far more nuanced

16:01.370 --> 16:05.082
than his native German.
No one described the inanimate

16:05.125 --> 16:08.543
as beautifully
as good old Rainer.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.868
Ah!

16:52.714 --> 16:54.798
What?

16:54.841 --> 16:57.509
Let me ask you a question.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.139
Do you think you pose a risk
to yourself

17:02.182 --> 17:04.893
or to others?

17:04.933 --> 17:07.394
I'm asking you because...

17:07.435 --> 17:10.605
I'm thinking
about releasing you.

17:12.607 --> 17:15.068
You're gonna send me
back out there.

17:15.112 --> 17:17.614
You don't wanna go?

17:17.654 --> 17:19.740
Today I've seen the Dragon.

17:19.781 --> 17:23.367
Yeah... I saw it too.

17:23.411 --> 17:26.163
Yeah, the fuck you did.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.708
Well, tell me more
about what you see.

17:32.127 --> 17:34.256
It's things that...

17:34.298 --> 17:36.758
that aren't right.

17:36.798 --> 17:38.800
What kind of things?

17:41.136 --> 17:43.807
The baby in the blood pouch.

17:45.807 --> 17:48.185
The river glowing red.

17:50.730 --> 17:53.066
A dog hatching
out of a big black egg.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.733
A demon with a crown of light.

17:55.777 --> 18:00.155
A needle the size of a sword.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.406
This needle, was it...

18:02.450 --> 18:04.786
some kind of drug?

18:08.957 --> 18:11.250
This isn't about

18:11.291 --> 18:14.921
goddamn drugs.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.048
This is some

18:17.088 --> 18:22.054
evil, unnatural shit that's got
no business happening.

18:22.095 --> 18:24.681
You think this is just some

18:24.721 --> 18:29.228
junkie bullshit? Heh, ask one
of the other guys. See how

18:29.269 --> 18:32.395
they're sleeping. I even got a name for
you-- saw it on a chart next to mine.

18:32.438 --> 18:34.772
Varga, H.

18:34.816 --> 18:40.989
OK, you talk to H-fucking-Varga before you
sit there and look at me like I'm full

18:41.029 --> 18:43.449
of shit.
I'm gonna be

18:43.490 --> 18:45.616
real nice for you if...

18:45.660 --> 18:47.827
Just get rid of me.

18:47.871 --> 18:51.583
Francis, please.
I'm here to help you. I'm...

18:51.624 --> 18:54.000
I'm a doctor.

18:54.044 --> 18:56.002
And I just want

18:56.046 --> 18:58.631
to help...

18:58.673 --> 19:00.592
someone.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.266
Then make it go away.

19:12.104 --> 19:15.272
Excuse me, Dr. Godfrey,
you have an urgent phone call.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.905
Feeling better?

19:23.949 --> 19:26.410
Shelley, give Mommy a moment.

19:29.537 --> 19:31.913
Do look more
inconvenienced, Norman.

19:31.957 --> 19:34.665
It's terribly flattering.

19:34.709 --> 19:38.002
Why don't you drink
this electrolytes concoction?

19:38.046 --> 19:40.298
You're probably
just dehydrated.

19:44.509 --> 19:48.056
I'm still feeling...
rather lightheaded.

19:48.096 --> 19:51.351
We should get you
to the hospital.

19:51.393 --> 19:52.852
No.

19:52.894 --> 19:54.644
No hospital.

19:56.815 --> 19:59.276
I'll be healthy as a horse
after a nap.

19:59.317 --> 20:02.112
Hm.

20:02.153 --> 20:03.778
Olivia,

20:03.820 --> 20:07.575
why didn't you call your son?

20:07.615 --> 20:12.329
Because I called you.
Is that such a crime?

20:12.372 --> 20:14.374
No.

20:18.501 --> 20:21.173
But driving without this...

20:26.345 --> 20:28.471
...is.

20:35.310 --> 20:37.270
You know, when I fell,

20:37.314 --> 20:42.486
I had a vision of you
striking that man.

20:42.527 --> 20:45.195
It was not unpleasant.

20:47.699 --> 20:51.493
I'm gonna drive you
and Shelley back.

20:51.536 --> 20:54.413
And then I have to go.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.957
Do you understand?

20:57.959 --> 21:00.377
No one's expecting more,
darling.

21:30.365 --> 21:33.993
Wipe your feet.
Stay a moment.

21:34.037 --> 21:36.163
What'd I just tell you?

21:36.204 --> 21:38.333
I've already cancelled
two patients.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.836
Mm. Some other hospitals
still stand in your absence.

21:41.876 --> 21:44.881
Must be a terrible blow
to your ego.

21:47.008 --> 21:49.969
I am gonna call a cab
and I'll wait at the corner.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.596
You will do no such thing.

21:56.976 --> 22:00.188
Do be civilized,
for Christ's sake.

22:00.230 --> 22:04.025
What's the worst thing you think
can happen from waiting inside?

22:06.027 --> 22:07.778
I have to go.

22:07.818 --> 22:10.490
Mm, yes, yes, you've said that.

22:14.742 --> 22:18.663
Olivia, was this staged?

22:18.704 --> 22:22.961
Oh, God. Wouldn't you
just love to think so?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.547
As though I would
leverage my health

22:25.587 --> 22:28.714
and my daughter's safekeeping
as a snare for your attention.

22:32.510 --> 22:35.721
You, um, you've been taking
the pills?

22:35.765 --> 22:38.518
What bloody business is that
of yours?

22:38.558 --> 22:41.894
Well, it is my bloody business
if you make it.

22:46.983 --> 22:50.238
You are the

22:50.278 --> 22:53.655
- stubbornest man I know.
- Huh.

22:53.699 --> 22:56.786
No one can make you do
anything you don't want.

23:01.749 --> 23:04.294
Come inside, darling. Hm?

23:04.336 --> 23:07.380
Not because I want you to.

23:11.759 --> 23:13.259
Hey.

23:15.805 --> 23:17.432
Hey.

23:17.472 --> 23:20.933
Um, your mother fainted
at the library.

23:20.977 --> 23:24.355
Are you all right?
Why didn't you call me?

23:24.395 --> 23:26.356
I'm... very tired.

23:26.397 --> 23:29.611
Uh, be a dear

23:29.653 --> 23:33.323
and run your uncle back
to wherever, would you?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.000
Come on, Uncle.

24:24.539 --> 24:26.875
Is she really OK?

24:26.916 --> 24:30.211
How would you say she's doing?
In general.

24:30.255 --> 24:32.213
I don't know.

24:32.257 --> 24:34.217
Psychotic?

24:34.259 --> 24:35.968
So, yeah.

24:43.602 --> 24:45.978
- How are you doing?
- Do you have any idea

24:46.019 --> 24:49.397
who might have impregnated
my daughter?

24:49.441 --> 24:52.611
If I did, he'd be at the
bottom of the river by now.

24:52.652 --> 24:55.319
Unfortunately,

24:55.363 --> 24:58.450
I don't know any more than you.

24:58.490 --> 25:01.661
Would you tell me if you did?

25:05.079 --> 25:08.625
Yeah.

25:08.666 --> 25:10.420
Does she seem

25:10.461 --> 25:14.423
happy to you? Letha.

25:14.464 --> 25:17.425
As happy as I've ever
seen her, I guess.

25:17.469 --> 25:19.636
Do you think that's some kind

25:19.679 --> 25:22.846
- of... red flag?
- Probably just

25:22.890 --> 25:24.848
hormonal euphoria.

25:24.892 --> 25:27.809
Ha! I don't know.

25:50.084 --> 25:53.002
I'm watching out for her.

25:53.045 --> 25:55.923
I want you to know that.
I always will.

25:55.963 --> 25:57.592
Good.

26:00.679 --> 26:03.931
Good.

26:48.017 --> 26:50.019
- Hey, Roman.
- Hey.

26:50.059 --> 26:53.020
Muah.

26:56.232 --> 26:58.192
Uh, we ran into each other
in town.

26:58.236 --> 27:00.194
- So I see.
- We got some frozen yogurt.

27:00.238 --> 27:03.825
- I had another sick craving.
- In your condition.

27:03.865 --> 27:05.951
I can only imagine.

27:08.037 --> 27:09.997
Maybe I had to be there.

27:10.038 --> 27:14.335
I'd better get going.
You two keep out of trouble, OK?

27:14.375 --> 27:16.671
Stay frosty.

27:16.711 --> 27:18.212
Thank you.

27:25.261 --> 27:27.682
See ya.

27:30.808 --> 27:33.104
It was just a ride home.

27:33.144 --> 27:34.771
Yeah, got it.

27:34.814 --> 27:36.315
Got a flashlight?

27:46.156 --> 27:48.618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:48.661 --> 27:50.453
<i>Bon nuit, mon frÃ¨re.</i>

27:52.329 --> 27:54.791
That was possibly the worst
movie I have ever seen ever.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.960
Come on.
You loved it.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.451
I so did not even.

27:58.573 --> 28:00.510
What do you mean?
I saw you laughing in the dark.

28:00.632 --> 28:03.217
Stop it. I was laughing
at you laughing.

28:03.259 --> 28:05.553
Oh, sure, OK.
Well, why on earth

28:05.595 --> 28:08.640
- did you pick it?
- I did not pick it!

28:08.681 --> 28:10.391
You did.

28:10.432 --> 28:12.143
I-I don't think so.

28:12.182 --> 28:14.269
Your text said, and I quote,

28:14.310 --> 28:17.271
"Hey, you wanna check out the
matinee of <i>Section 5</i> tomorrow?

28:17.315 --> 28:20.401
- I hear it's amazing."
- I have no recall.

28:20.442 --> 28:23.153
You're such a liar.

28:23.193 --> 28:27.240
Well, it was, uh, kind of

28:27.281 --> 28:30.117
amazing...ly bad.

28:31.788 --> 28:33.748
You're a dork.

28:33.788 --> 28:37.750
Well, you're on a date with a
dork, so what does that make you?

28:40.127 --> 28:42.131
I'll get back to you.

29:07.865 --> 29:09.826
<i>You should expect</i>
<i>to receive an offer</i>

29:09.866 --> 29:12.827
soon from a firm
called Lod, LLC.

29:12.871 --> 29:15.288
I'm getting an offer?

29:15.329 --> 29:16.833
To buy you out.

30:37.413 --> 30:42.000
"Well, you ordered the wrong
paint for the nursery."

30:42.041 --> 30:44.961
God.

30:45.002 --> 30:47.212
Huh.

30:59.102 --> 31:03.605
No one can make you do anything
you don't want.

31:03.646 --> 31:05.106
Ha.

31:22.289 --> 31:24.041
You want something?

31:24.085 --> 31:27.005
Um, yeah, I guess, um...
cherry coke?

31:27.046 --> 31:30.133
Retro. Nice. You got it!

31:30.173 --> 31:31.674
Thanks.

32:10.337 --> 32:13.634
You are safe.

32:13.674 --> 32:16.679
Remembering you are safe is
a positive coping strategy.

32:19.431 --> 32:21.851
Scared you?

32:23.684 --> 32:26.313
No. Kind of, a little,
not really.

32:26.355 --> 32:28.772
Sorry. I know it's not funny.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.817
It's OK.
It really is.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.653
Requests?

32:40.036 --> 32:42.872
How does it feel to have
your name on everything?

32:45.083 --> 32:47.085
Like a fucking pimp.

32:50.211 --> 32:53.507
Isn't there somewhere around back
we can park this? You know...

32:53.548 --> 32:56.299
Nobody gives a shit
what happens out here.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.303
Except us,

32:58.345 --> 33:00.056
right?

33:18.655 --> 33:20.159
Cool.

33:40.846 --> 33:43.847
You ever see this place
when it was running?

33:46.769 --> 33:49.354
My old man closed it
before I was born.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.573
Lots of people died here--
workers and shit.

34:16.632 --> 34:19.677
You know when you close your ears,
sometimes the sound of your heart is

34:19.717 --> 34:23.181
like a little man
walking through snow.

34:23.222 --> 34:25.016
Yep.

34:27.309 --> 34:31.813
Hey, what was that, uh, big
structure that was outside?

34:31.856 --> 34:33.815
It's a Bessemer converter.

34:33.858 --> 34:36.943
At one point, they made pig iron
into money.

34:41.657 --> 34:44.784
Do we have any idea
what we may be looking for?

34:44.827 --> 34:48.289
Uh... driver's license,

34:48.331 --> 34:50.581
social security card,

34:50.623 --> 34:52.583
dream journal...

34:52.626 --> 34:55.460
This is a joke.
Left or right?

34:57.463 --> 34:59.257
I don't know. Let's split up.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.800
I'll go this way.

35:23.824 --> 35:25.659
What's up?

35:25.701 --> 35:28.536
- Nothing.
- You find anything?

35:28.579 --> 35:30.789
No.

35:30.831 --> 35:32.498
Let's go.

35:38.505 --> 35:41.465
You know, it's crazy to think what it
must have been like when that thing was

35:41.507 --> 35:44.929
up and running. My mom said that
when she was a little girl,

35:44.969 --> 35:46.931
they couldn't hang
their sheets outside

35:46.972 --> 35:48.639
'cause they'd go all black.

35:50.726 --> 35:53.938
- I went in there once.
- No, you did not.

35:53.978 --> 35:57.942
I did. My friends and I were
just messing around

35:57.983 --> 36:01.777
on the tracks one day
and... we just went for it.

36:01.820 --> 36:05.907
Whoa. What's it like?

36:05.949 --> 36:08.159
I mean, it's...

36:08.202 --> 36:13.081
pretty much just big
and empty and gross--

36:13.123 --> 36:14.958
except for this, like,

36:15.000 --> 36:17.335
giant, like, black...

36:17.378 --> 36:20.255
cauldron thing they used
to make steel in.

36:20.297 --> 36:21.882
They call it a Bessemer.

36:21.922 --> 36:24.635
Double, double,
toil and trouble.

36:24.675 --> 36:27.179
Looks like a big black egg
with a hole at the top.

36:30.724 --> 36:34.603
It's still there,
but now it's on its side,

36:34.643 --> 36:38.983
supposedly... you know,
cursed or whatever because

36:39.023 --> 36:41.525
it crushed someone, and all his

36:41.568 --> 36:43.777
guts and intestines spilled
out of his mouth,

36:43.820 --> 36:48.867
and he was alive all the while,
and he was choking on it and...

36:48.909 --> 36:50.869
Oh, my god.

36:50.911 --> 36:52.954
I wanted to check it out,
you know?

36:52.996 --> 36:55.581
Peek inside.

36:55.623 --> 36:58.710
- I put my head in.
- You stuck your head in it?

36:58.751 --> 37:02.297
Well, you know, just...

37:02.340 --> 37:04.300
gathering material.

37:09.972 --> 37:12.599
- Do it, Chrissie!
- Chrissie, go do it!

37:12.641 --> 37:14.851
- Go into it!
- Go for it, Chrissie!

37:14.893 --> 37:16.353
Go, keep going.

37:16.393 --> 37:18.356
- Keep going!
- Go on, Chrissie,

37:18.396 --> 37:21.358
- do it! Do it!
- Do it!

37:21.400 --> 37:23.652
Oh, you're really brave.

37:23.693 --> 37:26.197
You're gonna be
an amazing writer.

37:26.237 --> 37:29.614
I hope so.

37:35.498 --> 37:38.291
Sorry, sorry.
God, sorry.

37:38.333 --> 37:41.585
Just... I-I thought
it was cool.

37:44.547 --> 37:47.009
Do you?

37:52.306 --> 37:53.806
OK.

38:01.190 --> 38:03.608
Feeling better?

38:03.650 --> 38:06.402
You summoned.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.742
What's Pryce up to?

38:11.782 --> 38:14.077
Mm, as long as I'm apprised
of quarterlies,

38:14.119 --> 38:16.329
I concern myself
with as little as possible

38:16.371 --> 38:20.333
- with whatever it is Pryce does.
- My daughter has

38:20.376 --> 38:23.795
expressed an interest in pursuing
treatment at the institute.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.838
Sensible.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.092
It won't happen while I'm alive.

38:29.134 --> 38:32.929
Darling, you're looking at me
like I'm supposed to argue

38:32.971 --> 38:35.681
something that's none
of my goddamn business.

38:35.724 --> 38:37.684
Well, someone had to approve

38:37.726 --> 38:40.061
the new obstetrics wing.

38:40.103 --> 38:44.315
Simply an option if she doesn't
prefer to give birth in a manger.

38:44.358 --> 38:48.070
What about this bid
to buy me out?

38:48.112 --> 38:52.739
Lod, LLC.
That's your business.

38:52.782 --> 38:54.242
First I've heard of it.

38:54.284 --> 38:56.619
When you're lying
about something

38:56.661 --> 38:59.789
I know that you know,
what exactly do you

38:59.831 --> 39:04.085
- expect me to believe?
- In my experience,

39:04.128 --> 39:06.088
people believe what they wish

39:06.130 --> 39:08.840
regardless
of your encouragement.

39:11.927 --> 39:15.597
Have we exhausted the reasons you
can pretend you called me here?

39:18.934 --> 39:21.561
This isn't
what you think it is.

39:21.603 --> 39:23.313
Oh.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.445
Mm. My mistake.

39:33.282 --> 39:37.452
Ah. Does that help you
get it up these days?

40:01.059 --> 40:04.396
- Is it OK?
- Is it OK?

40:15.949 --> 40:20.996
âªâª You're mine âª

40:21.038 --> 40:26.668
âª All mine,
you can do anything âª

40:26.710 --> 40:32.632
âª That you desire of me âª

40:36.260 --> 40:40.391
âª Anywhere you go âª

40:42.809 --> 40:45.478
âª My heart will guide me âª

40:45.521 --> 40:48.773
Oh! Oh! I'm coming.

40:48.815 --> 40:51.150
- Fuck me.
- Oh, oh.

40:51.193 --> 40:55.864
- Oh, oh, Norman.
- Oh, God. Oh, fuck.

40:55.905 --> 41:00.244
Ah!

41:00.284 --> 41:02.496
Ah.

41:02.538 --> 41:11.045
âª Well I go with my heart,
can go a little way âª

41:11.088 --> 41:14.965
âª I know âª

41:15.007 --> 41:16.719
âª I'll never never... âªâª

41:16.760 --> 41:18.721
What-what's wrong?

41:18.762 --> 41:20.347
What's going on? What?

41:20.389 --> 41:23.349
What's wrong?

41:23.391 --> 41:25.476
Hello, Christina.

41:25.518 --> 41:28.521
Ow! Fuck! What are you d--
Fuck! Stop! Stop! Fuck!

41:28.563 --> 41:32.358
Stop! What the hell are you
doing?! Stop! Ow! Ow! Stop it!

41:32.400 --> 41:35.195
Ah! Ah! Ah!

41:35.237 --> 41:37.822
Ah! Ahhh!

41:37.864 --> 41:40.867
Ahh! Ahhh!

42:11.315 --> 42:13.483
I gotta go and pick up
some paint.

42:15.485 --> 42:17.320
For the nursery.

42:20.657 --> 42:22.117
No VOC.

42:26.664 --> 42:28.623
Canar... Canary Linen.

42:35.172 --> 42:37.132
Why are you telling me this,
darling?

42:37.172 --> 42:38.634
I don't know.

42:46.056 --> 42:48.559
All right, I'm done.
Let's get out of here.

42:48.601 --> 42:50.561
We haven't found anything.

42:50.603 --> 42:52.563
Yeah. I'm good with that.

42:52.606 --> 42:56.777
Let's just keep looking.

42:56.818 --> 43:00.237
Aw.

43:09.789 --> 43:12.543
I hate rats.

43:12.583 --> 43:15.960
You hear that?

43:16.003 --> 43:18.005
Yeah, do you smell that?

43:20.467 --> 43:22.135
Ugh.

43:28.516 --> 43:30.018
Ugh!

43:39.360 --> 43:41.362
- Hey.
- Yeah?

43:47.577 --> 43:49.579
What the fuck is that?

43:51.581 --> 43:53.876
It's... it's
Lisa Willoughby.

43:57.335 --> 43:59.338
I'd like to go.

44:07.304 --> 44:13.643
- Who the fuck comes in here?
- I don't know.

44:13.686 --> 44:15.688
It's your fucking mill.

44:18.567 --> 44:20.735
Should we tell someone?

44:20.777 --> 44:22.737
Tell them what?

44:22.780 --> 44:25.907
I dunno.

44:31.954 --> 44:34.416
Shit!

44:34.458 --> 44:35.958
I'll deal with it.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.545
Just do it, OK?

44:38.585 --> 44:40.255
Don't fuck around.

44:40.297 --> 44:42.507
You've made your point.

44:47.512 --> 44:49.139
Where?

44:49.179 --> 44:51.141
What are you talking about?

44:51.181 --> 44:53.476
You said you ran into Letha
in town. Where?

44:53.518 --> 44:55.228
Jesus Christ! Come on!

44:55.268 --> 44:57.230
Was she helping out
with the water heater too?

44:57.271 --> 44:59.106
They're gonna find your car.

44:59.148 --> 45:01.150
You should've told me you were
into the pregnant thing.

45:01.192 --> 45:04.070
- I could've hooked you up.
- Roman, she's your cousin!

45:04.112 --> 45:06.280
I don't like secrets.

45:08.699 --> 45:11.911
Hey, you might as well
get your tight ass out here!

45:11.954 --> 45:15.081
'Cause I'm gonna be real pissed
if I have to go in there!

45:15.123 --> 45:17.083
XK Douchebag.

45:17.125 --> 45:20.460
Master Godfrey's,
if memory serves. Little fucker.

45:20.503 --> 45:22.797
Just get rid of them.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.300
Please!

45:28.302 --> 45:30.304
Since you said the magic word.

45:37.061 --> 45:40.190
Fuck.

45:40.231 --> 45:43.485
Well, olly, olly, oxen free.

45:45.487 --> 45:47.822
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- Well, maybe you could start

45:47.864 --> 45:50.534
by telling us what the hell
you're doing out here.

45:50.574 --> 45:53.954
Well, gee, I was sitting quietly
by myself playing solitaire.

45:53.996 --> 45:55.181
I hope wasn't disturbing anyone.

45:55.302 --> 45:57.358
You think we won't run you in,
you damn little punk?

45:57.875 --> 46:01.043
Come on, just do it.
Do the creepy roofie eyes.

46:01.085 --> 46:03.253
Yeah, what does that say?

46:03.295 --> 46:05.632
We know what it says.

46:08.802 --> 46:13.054
- OK, I'll-I'll level with you.
- What are you doing?

46:13.097 --> 46:15.181
I was actually jacking off
to French postcards

46:15.224 --> 46:18.936
of your mother, and, uh, would
prefer a little privacy.

46:18.978 --> 46:21.398
So, if you wouldn't mind
pissing off

46:21.438 --> 46:24.775
- and staying away from my property--
- Best news I got all week.

46:28.320 --> 46:31.157
Well, you looking at something
in there, little pretty boy? Hm?

46:31.199 --> 46:34.159
Oh, you got a friend in there?
Huh? At the request

46:34.202 --> 46:36.914
of Olivia Godfrey, I'm placing
you under arrest for trespassing

46:36.954 --> 46:39.623
on private property.

46:39.666 --> 46:41.751
Our mistake.
Everyone knows

46:41.793 --> 46:44.085
fuck-face doesn't have
any friends.

46:57.601 --> 46:59.061
Yes?

46:59.101 --> 47:02.230
Mm, yes, this is.

47:02.271 --> 47:03.981
He what?!

47:18.119 --> 47:19.748
No, no, no.

47:19.789 --> 47:21.750
Where are the keys?

47:24.126 --> 47:26.922
Why?! Fuck!

47:26.963 --> 47:29.090
What are you doing?!
What are you--

47:31.300 --> 47:33.135
What are you doing?

47:43.646 --> 47:45.398
You asshole.

49:04.434 --> 49:06.478
<i>Mil truj.</i>

49:16.304 --> 49:22.704
âª Tricky anaconda
climbing down a rabbit hole âª

49:22.746 --> 49:28.918
âª Did you ever wonder
where it's gonna go âª
