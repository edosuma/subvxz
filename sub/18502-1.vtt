00:35.200 --> 00:37.112
# Oh, no #

00:37.200 --> 00:41.353
# See you walking 'round
like it's a funeral #

00:41.440 --> 00:42.669
# Not so serious, girl #

00:42.760 --> 00:45.115
# Why those feet cold? #

00:45.200 --> 00:46.793
# We just getting started #

00:46.880 --> 00:48.792
# Don't you tiptoe #

00:48.880 --> 00:51.554
# Tiptoe, ah #

00:51.640 --> 00:52.994
# Waste time with a masterpiece #

00:53.080 --> 00:55.037
# Don't waste time with a masterpiece #

00:55.560 --> 00:57.040
# You should be rolling with me #

00:57.160 --> 00:59.595
# You should be rolling with me, ah #

00:59.680 --> 01:03.117
# You're a real-life fantasy #

01:03.680 --> 01:05.235
# But you're moving so carefully #

01:05.319 --> 01:07.312
# Let's start living dangerously #

01:07.400 --> 01:09.551
# Talk to me, baby #

01:10.280 --> 01:11.395
# I'm going blind #

01:11.480 --> 01:12.994
# From this sweet, sweet craving #

01:13.080 --> 01:14.230
# Whoa-oh #

01:14.320 --> 01:15.310
# Let's lose our minds #

01:15.400 --> 01:17.471
# And go crazy, crazy #

01:18.320 --> 01:19.959
# Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya #

01:20.400 --> 01:23.595
# I keep on hoping
we'll eat cake by the ocean #

01:23.680 --> 01:25.512
# Walk for me, baby #

01:26.680 --> 01:30.355
# I'll be Diddy,
you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh #

01:30.440 --> 01:33.831
# Let's lose our minds
and go crazy, crazy #

01:34.440 --> 01:36.591
# Ah, ya, ya, ya, ya #

01:36.680 --> 01:39.991
# I keep on hoping
we'll eat cake by the ocean #

01:46.080 --> 01:47.992
You guys wanna handle this for me?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.554
- On it, boss.
- On it.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.869
I just said that.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.909
Why do you even set this thing, Rafe,
if you're not gonna go to sleep?

02:03.000 --> 02:03.990
Give me the blaster, quick.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.399
Ready. Aim. Fire!

02:07.600 --> 02:09.074
Check the barrel.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.594
Uh-oh.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.599
Ah, that never gets old.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.155
Great. Now I have two headaches.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.431
Let's blast it. On three. One...

02:22.000 --> 02:23.673
Rafe.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.312
Rafe?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.473
Rise and shine, buddy.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.630
Rafe.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.200
Are you up?

02:37.800 --> 02:39.154
Wake up!

02:40.440 --> 02:41.715
What?

02:42.680 --> 02:44.512
Oh, boy. Is it morning already?

02:44.640 --> 02:46.995
Please tell me you did not
stay up all night drawing again.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.715
No, of course not.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.712
No, the only reason
I would ever be up all night

02:50.800 --> 02:53.755
is just because I'm so excited
to go to school today.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.035
But I wasn't up all night.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.918
- Come here.
- Why?

02:58.320 --> 03:00.232
Gross. What're you doing?

03:00.320 --> 03:03.154
I'm wiping the excitement off your face.
It looks a lot like ink.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.035
Mom, where's my breakfast?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.235
It's coming.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.994
Georgia, for the millionth time,

03:15.080 --> 03:16.958
Calvin's not allowed in my room.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.394
For the billionth time,

03:20.480 --> 03:22.035
it's Mr. Giggles to you.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.715
And just because you're grumpy
doesn't give you the right

03:24.800 --> 03:27.440
to make the rest of us miserable.

03:27.560 --> 03:28.550
Okay, guys, come on.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.314
Let's go, Calvin.
We don't have to take this.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.360
You know, hon, I have to say,

03:33.480 --> 03:36.871
really impressive updates
for the Vinlothian Star Cruiser.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.315
- Thanks.
- Look...

03:39.400 --> 03:42.595
I know it's hard, starting
a new school mid-semester,

03:42.680 --> 03:44.475
and I don't wanna take this away from you,

03:44.560 --> 03:45.789
but you have to promise me

03:45.880 --> 03:48.755
you won't spend every waking,
sleeping moment working on this

03:48.840 --> 03:51.115
when there's a whole big world out there.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.351
Mom, there's a whole
big world in there, too.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.113
I'm talking about the real world.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.475
Give it a try, would you?

03:56.560 --> 03:57.630
For me?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.195
Hmm?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.555
Okay.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.393
On the menu for today,

04:05.480 --> 04:07.790
we have a farro basil salad
with tomato coulis.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.872
You know, Georgia and I
would be completely fine

04:09.960 --> 04:11.553
if you just made us, like,
a bologna sandwich.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.195
I'm a sous-chef, not a chemical engineer.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.634
Oh, and for dessert,

04:15.720 --> 04:18.791
we have a deconstructed lime tart.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.595
- Why'd you deconstruct it?
- I don't know.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.990
I don't wanna do something
the same old, regular way.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.753
Where's the imagination in that?

04:24.840 --> 04:27.150
If you wanna stand out,
you wanna make a difference,

04:27.240 --> 04:29.232
you gotta think outside the box.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.637
Did you order an Uber?

04:36.520 --> 04:38.034
# Turn it up #

04:40.680 --> 04:42.399
Oh, man!

04:43.040 --> 04:44.474
She's gonna get me arrested.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.710
Better you than me.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.715
Hello! I'm not getting any younger here.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.755
Uh, do that again, and you're
not getting any older either.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.635
I was just pulling it around to save time.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.915
Never again. Move.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.070
# Somebody save your soul #

04:59.160 --> 05:00.913
# 'Cause you've been sinning in the city #

05:01.000 --> 05:01.990
# I know... #

05:02.080 --> 05:03.395
You should wanna be early, too,

05:03.480 --> 05:06.035
considering your track record.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.315
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.115
Fine. Shut me out.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.429
But I'm the only one

05:11.520 --> 05:14.075
willing to give you the cold, hard facts.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.115
You've been kicked
out of two schools in one year.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.112
Georgia, I'll handle the lectures.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.429
Go for it.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.315
No, thank you. I'm tired of that lecture.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.435
See, you're exhausting people.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.315
This is the last school that'll take you.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.875
And if you mess up here,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.675
you're gonna end up at a new school

05:28.760 --> 05:30.433
called "Prison Elementary."

05:30.520 --> 05:32.193
So, get your head out of your keister.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.833
I'm just trying to help
a brother out, Mom.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.233
# 'Cause you don't even know #

05:44.080 --> 05:46.595
# Bet I can make your hands clap #

05:47.480 --> 05:49.312
Look how nice it looks.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.593
# Bet I can make your hands clap #

05:53.200 --> 05:56.475
It's gonna be a great first day.
I can just feel it.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.275
So, just be polite
and don't forget to listen.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.192
I'm sorry, what?

06:02.360 --> 06:05.194
See, this is why kids
shouldn't have espresso.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.636
No, no, no, I told you no more coffee.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.513
- Narc.
- Addict.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.354
Snitches get stitches.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.270
Stop. Listen. They have me working
a double again, so Carl's gonna pick you up.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.511
- No!
- Why?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.434
I know. It's been a tough year
for all of us.

06:20.520 --> 06:22.075
But he's there for me when I need him.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.635
And lately, I have really needed him.

06:23.720 --> 06:27.031
So, let's all put on
our be-nice-to-Carl faces, okay?

06:30.200 --> 06:31.953
Okay, we'll work on it, we'll work on it.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.155
Listen, have a great first day.
I love you so much.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.675
Be on your best behavior. Okay?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.229
Quiet in the hallways, please. Okay?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.994
I'd like to have a silent
hallway one of these days.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.195
Excuse me, young man.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.395
What is your name?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.470
Rafe Katchadorian.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.994
What did you just say to me?

06:47.080 --> 06:48.639
It's my last name. I'm new.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.795
Well, being new does not entitle you

06:50.880 --> 06:52.755
to swagger in here with no clothes on.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.315
I'm... I'm wearing clothes.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.595
No, those aren't clothes.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.235
Those are rule violations.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.595
Every single thing you have on

06:58.680 --> 07:00.592
flies in the face of rule number 22.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.033
What's rule number 22?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.350
Are you telling me that you
haven't read our code of conduct?

07:05.440 --> 07:07.352
All right, if I don't tell you,

07:07.440 --> 07:09.830
I won't get in trouble, right?

07:13.480 --> 07:15.039
Unbelievable.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.753
The code of conduct, young man.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.395
Read it, learn it, live it.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.675
Rule number 22 is,
"Always obey the dress code."

07:21.760 --> 07:24.150
That means no printed shirts,
no wild colors.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.595
And look what's happening
to the collar of your shirt here.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.670
Your headphones are dragging it open.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.790
Nobody needs to see

07:28.880 --> 07:31.515
where your chest hairs are going to be.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.716
Yeah, okay, yeah, got it.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.190
"Got it"?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.315
How about, "Got it, sir"?

07:37.400 --> 07:39.392
Rule number one here at Hills Village

07:39.520 --> 07:40.835
is to respect your principal.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.070
And since I am the principal,

07:42.160 --> 07:43.833
that means you need to respect me

07:43.920 --> 07:44.990
by calling me "sir,"

07:45.080 --> 07:46.992
or if you prefer, "Principal Dwight."

07:47.080 --> 07:48.753
Or maybe even "Sir Dwight," if you like.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.194
Good.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.551
You have recognized
my keen sense of humor.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.630
Not everybody does.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.393
Good man. Okay, good.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.949
All right. On your way
into school, which is that way.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.555
There he is!

08:17.120 --> 08:19.715
- Ah, intense, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.755
Hey, Georgia thought
I was gonna end up in prison,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.991
but I think I'm already here.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.594
Yeah, well, you know, at least in prison

08:25.680 --> 08:28.673
we can carve, like, shanks
out of toothbrushes, you know.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.433
It's good to see you, Leo.

08:30.520 --> 08:31.954
Honestly, I didn't think
you'd be here, too.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.078
This was the last school in the district

08:35.200 --> 08:36.190
that would take us.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.192
- Holla!
- Holla!

08:38.280 --> 08:39.999
- It's so weird...
- Excuse me.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.395
- Is your name David?
- No.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.676
Were you carved by Michelangelo?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.470
No.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.195
Stop standing around like a statue.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.835
You're blocking the flow of traffic.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.674
Yeah, you heard the warden,
get back to your cell, Rafe.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.995
Hallway etiquette is no
laughing matter, young man.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.912
And rule number 11 clearly states,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.195
"No loitering in the halls."

09:01.280 --> 09:02.680
Okay.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.310
Okay?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.995
Okay, sir?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.276
It's Vice Principal Stricker.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.995
Go, now.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.793
- Shon.
- Yeah?

09:17.880 --> 09:20.111
Do you know how to sync this
to your phone?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.475
Um... probably not.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.710
Doesn't your dad work at Best Buy?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.792
Oh, yeah, he does.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.355
Just in marketing.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.794
So, you don't get any free stuff?

09:28.920 --> 09:32.231
I do, but mostly office supplies.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.952
Nice first impression.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.190
You got it?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.598
It's just homeroom. We'll wait.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.675
Okay, let's start class.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.433
Bella? Bella.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.635
Please put your phone away during class.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.835
You can't rate teachers
on Yelp anyway. I've tried.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.832
So, we have a new student today.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.036
I'm assuming you are...

10:01.160 --> 10:02.875
I'm a transfer student, sir.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.314
Oh, you don't have to call me "sir."

10:04.400 --> 10:07.595
It makes me feel old,
and I already feel old.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.475
I drive a Saturn.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.950
It's just, Principal Dwight
told me to call everyone "sir."

10:12.040 --> 10:13.235
- It's, like, one of his rules.
- Okay.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.994
Well, I don't see any Principal
Dwight in here. Do you?

10:16.960 --> 10:19.429
Seriously, do you?
Because he is a master of disguise.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.275
So, we have a new transfer student today

10:23.360 --> 10:26.075
whose name I am realizing
I did not ask just now.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.715
- What's your name?
- Rafe Katchadorian.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.793
Whoa! It would suck to have
to spell that dumb name.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.155
Well, Rafe, welcome to hell.

10:33.240 --> 10:34.833
Back to the homework from last night.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.795
You all listened to the Drake
and Future mixtape last night.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.715
Because today, we will be
talking about fair trade.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.553
Okay. There's a hot track,

10:43.640 --> 10:46.275
and it's produced
by Future's Hendrix crew.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.555
Drizzy, Champagne Papi,

10:49.640 --> 10:52.109
is in the studio with Future, and he says,

10:52.200 --> 10:53.595
"Hey, yo, let me get on that track."

10:53.680 --> 10:55.194
"Well, I'm gonna have to charge you."

10:55.280 --> 10:56.475
And what does Drake say back?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.115
"Charge me? I thought we were boys."

10:58.200 --> 10:59.953
"We're the best of boys.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.355
We're gonna make a mixtape together."

11:01.440 --> 11:03.795
But there's a tax.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.595
Not anymore, once NATO came along.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.115
Teller, it's NAFTA, not NATO.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.954
Ah? What? Word?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.952
Shon is right, it is NAFTA.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.675
So, now there is no tax.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.315
So, Champagne Papi and young Hendrix

11:19.400 --> 11:21.195
can be on each other's tracks

11:21.280 --> 11:23.511
without having to charge anybody.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.910
Much the way that America and Canada

11:26.000 --> 11:27.673
have goods importing and exporting.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.715
Hey, Kick-a-dorkian.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.195
Does anyone have any questions?

11:32.280 --> 11:33.270
It's Miller time.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.875
Stay out of my way,
or I'll wedgie you so bad

11:35.960 --> 11:38.191
you'll be able to taste your underwear.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.309
How?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.313
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:45.400 --> 11:48.632
let's get ready for the pain event.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.350
Oh, this one always delivers
a fistful of hollers!

11:52.480 --> 11:53.470
The Grip-n-Rip!

11:57.240 --> 11:58.715
Holy Yosemite!

11:58.800 --> 12:00.675
Want to lodge a complaint?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.638
It's the Beaver-Tail!

12:04.680 --> 12:07.235
Irritating, even to people just watching,

12:07.320 --> 12:08.959
the Man-Bun!

12:09.080 --> 12:10.992
Over-rated and over-exposed,

12:11.080 --> 12:13.117
the Kardashian!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.753
You get that I can kick your butt, right?

12:15.880 --> 12:17.234
My bad.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.073
All right.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.875
- There is an agreement.
- Sorry.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.314
Free trade.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.435
For tomorrow, I want everybody

12:24.520 --> 12:25.995
to become familiar

12:26.080 --> 12:28.436
with every single member
of the Wu-Tang Clan.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.350
We're gonna take a little trip
to the Bronx.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.875
So, in conclusion...

12:33.960 --> 12:36.395
I'm not just gonna stand here
and make a bunch of promises.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.595
Just this.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.195
You should vote for me
because my dad is super rich

12:40.320 --> 12:42.630
and my stepmom is really hot.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.995
Oh, ho, ho!

12:48.040 --> 12:49.915
Stormin' Norman, what a speech!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.514
Well done.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.070
Hey.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.675
Uh, for those of you who don't know me,

12:57.760 --> 13:00.195
I'm Jeanne Galleta,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.033
president of the AV club.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.835
I'm guessing most of you
don't know what that is,

13:04.920 --> 13:07.958
since I'm also the only member.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.553
Gandhi once said,

13:11.640 --> 13:14.075
"We have to be the change we wish to see."

13:14.160 --> 13:17.035
And the way I see it,

13:17.120 --> 13:18.315
cutting funding for the arts...

13:18.440 --> 13:19.430
Hello.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.635
...was just dumb.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.871
We have to bring it back,

13:22.960 --> 13:25.270
so we can express ourselves
as human beings

13:25.360 --> 13:27.511
and not just a bunch of robots.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.593
Also, we've gotta do something
about this dress code, okay?

13:30.680 --> 13:32.235
It stifles individuality!

13:32.320 --> 13:33.913
Oh, look at that, we're out of time.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.315
Sorry, Miss Galleta. Gosh.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.509
No, no, no.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.829
Please. No, don't clap.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.835
No need to be polite.

13:44.920 --> 13:45.955
Just hold your clapping till the end.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.110
I think we're probably all
voting for Norman anyway, right?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.192
I've seen his stepmom. You're not kidding.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.994
All right, folks, you know...

13:54.960 --> 13:55.950
That's not funny.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.155
Why is this wrapped around...

13:57.240 --> 13:59.277
Let's not wrap the microphone
around the stand anymore.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.595
It's annoying.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.514
Folks, in two months,
we will all be competing

14:03.600 --> 14:05.831
for something of the utmost importance.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.315
Who knows what I'm referring to?

14:07.400 --> 14:09.471
B.L.A.A.R.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.755
- I can't hear you!
- B.L.A.A.R.!

14:12.840 --> 14:14.235
Now you're just yelling. No yelling!

14:14.320 --> 14:16.471
That's right, in eight short weeks,

14:16.560 --> 14:17.955
we will all be taking

14:18.040 --> 14:23.957
the Baseline Assessment
of Academic Readiness!

14:27.560 --> 14:28.630
All right. Hey, you there!

14:28.760 --> 14:29.955
Do you love your parents?

14:30.040 --> 14:32.271
I guess so.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.915
Hear me when I tell you,
you don't love them

14:34.000 --> 14:37.072
an eighth as much as I love this test.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.470
A few years ago, my wife asked me

14:39.560 --> 14:41.074
to stop paying so much
attention to the B.L.A.A.R.,

14:41.160 --> 14:42.640
and pay a little more attention to her.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.190
Well, she's gone now,
and I have no regrets.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.312
And, folks, if we are going to maintain

14:48.400 --> 14:49.390
our number one standing,

14:49.480 --> 14:51.870
which we most certainly do wanna do...

14:51.960 --> 14:53.394
This is hilarious!

14:54.360 --> 14:56.795
Oh, my gosh! Zombie Dwight!

14:56.880 --> 14:58.872
...and only the B.L.A.A.R.,
and nothing but the B.L.A.A.R.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.354
No, come on, give it...

15:02.680 --> 15:05.593
Hey, what's with
all the kerfuffle out there?

15:08.440 --> 15:10.511
This is legit hilarious.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.116
Hey!

15:17.480 --> 15:19.115
Hand over the notebook, Dani,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.759
if you know what's good for you.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.160
Smart move!

15:28.760 --> 15:29.750
Oh!

15:39.560 --> 15:41.597
This concludes our assembly.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.719
I don't look like that.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.753
I don't look like that at all.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.269
Son, as principal,

16:02.360 --> 16:05.155
I think of myself
as the father of this school.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.515
And there's nothing I wouldn't do

16:06.600 --> 16:07.795
to protect a child.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.595
- Do you follow me?
- Sure. Yeah.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.715
You think the students are your children.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.393
What? No.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.314
The students aren't my children.
The school is my child.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.595
And you attacked my child today.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.635
You punched it in the face.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.435
What kind of a person
punches a child in the face?

16:23.520 --> 16:25.475
That was a very important
assembly, and you ruined it.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.550
I know. I'm sorry.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.233
Honestly, I was just doodling.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.835
Listen, man, I am totally into creativity.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.115
I really dig it.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.669
I'm a hip cat from way back.
You better believe it.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.035
But it doesn't belong in school.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.995
Art should be locked up in a museum

16:40.080 --> 16:42.355
where old people can enjoy it
or children on field trips.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.352
We get to go on field trips
to art museums?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.835
God, no. No.
That's a complete waste of time.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.276
We're not doing that.
All right! Rule number 26.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.754
Read it out loud, please.

16:52.680 --> 16:53.750
"Rule 26.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.395
Any written material deemed
inappropriate or offensive

16:56.480 --> 16:59.234
will be confiscated and destroyed"?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.959
And destroyed. Very good.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.555
You're a good reader.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.595
Gus, bring your bucket in here, please.

17:04.680 --> 17:05.670
The yellow bucket.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.952
This is a bucket full of acid

17:10.040 --> 17:11.994
that will completely dissolve
your notebook.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.953
It's probably not a great idea to keep
a bucket full of acid in a middle school,

17:15.040 --> 17:18.075
but if you can think of a better way
to dissolve notebooks, I'm all ears.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.194
Why are you still here?

17:19.280 --> 17:20.794
Mm.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.108
All right!

17:22.200 --> 17:24.994
Good-bye, offensive
and inappropriate material.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.470
Wait, hold on. Look, please,
I've had that book forever.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.792
And, I mean, I worked so hard
on all those drawings.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.994
Well, maybe if you had worked that hard
on something worthwhile instead,

17:34.080 --> 17:37.754
like, for instance, your school work,
we wouldn't be here right now.

17:37.840 --> 17:38.830
Please, you don't understand.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.673
These drawings mean everything to me.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.230
Really?

17:45.880 --> 17:47.155
Well...

17:49.400 --> 17:50.470
In that case...

17:51.720 --> 17:53.916
Rules are rules.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.672
You guys are doomed. Bye-bye.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.395
This super stinks.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.355
Tech support.

18:05.440 --> 18:06.715
- Here we go.
- Tech support.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.755
Peace out!

18:08.840 --> 18:11.395
It was an honor serving with you, sir.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.949
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush
to pick out my nose.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.111
Yeah, me too. What?

18:16.240 --> 18:17.993
Tech support.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.875
Your new principal sucks!

18:20.960 --> 18:21.996
Don't forget to draw me

18:22.120 --> 18:23.110
on the other side, Rafe!

18:35.200 --> 18:37.510
- Dude!
- Hey, man.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.080
I don't wanna talk about it, all right?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.073
Hey, you, uh...

18:45.160 --> 18:46.355
you ever open that thing I got you?

18:47.800 --> 18:49.314
Ah...

18:49.400 --> 18:50.629
I'm sorry, I forgot.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.075
No worries, man.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.514
You've been busy. Just...

18:54.600 --> 18:56.555
I just think it might be
a good time, you know?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.790
It might cheer you up.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.872
It's whatever, though. Doesn't matter.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.755
- You want a ride?
- You're funny.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.399
No, not with that doofus.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.874
All right, well, I'm out of here.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.354
Good luck.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.913
Hop in! You know I can't come
to a complete stop. Let's go!

19:14.320 --> 19:16.875
- Hurry up!
- # I get knocked down #

19:16.960 --> 19:18.155
# But I get up again #

19:19.480 --> 19:21.233
Let's go. Come on.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.070
Bear, why'd you get a stick
if you don't know how to drive it?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.675
It's not a true sports car
if it's an automatic, all right?

19:29.760 --> 19:32.670
Besides, I really like to feel
the road when I'm driving.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.395
Hey, towel, please.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.075
Sorry, I almost got "person" on your seat.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.674
Hey, "F" your "I,"

19:38.760 --> 19:40.513
these seats are
Italian leather, all right?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.715
I'm trying to keep them nice
for the re-sale.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.998
Bear, you do know you can't
sell a car you don't own.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.794
Don't own yet, my friend. Don't own yet.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.520
104 more payments,
and this baby is all mine.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.354
# I get knocked down, but I get up again #

19:55.440 --> 19:57.432
# You're never gonna keep me down #

19:59.360 --> 20:00.755
Hey.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.559
Not so close to the car, fat boy!

20:05.280 --> 20:06.396
Come here, Calvin.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.835
Come here, boy. You're a good boy.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.798
Don't listen to that mean man. Come here.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.835
You did that on purpose.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.555
So, sue me.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.632
I wish Mom knew what a butt wipe you are.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.076
Hey. Butt wipes feel pretty good.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.155
Who doesn't love a butt wipe, huh?

20:27.240 --> 20:29.152
Everyone loves a butt wipe.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.277
So, I guess the joke is on you.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.675
No.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.672
The joke's on you.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.674
Huh?

20:50.760 --> 20:51.989
Eh...

21:08.120 --> 21:09.110
Hey.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.270
Oh, hey. What's up, man?

21:10.360 --> 21:11.919
Oh, cool. You found it.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.035
Oh, no. Don't read the card,
because then things

21:15.120 --> 21:16.349
are gonna get sappy or whatever,

21:16.440 --> 21:17.669
and I hate that.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.831
So, just open the present.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.240
All right.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.915
I figured your other one,
may it rest in peace,

21:25.000 --> 21:25.990
was almost full,

21:26.080 --> 21:28.072
so you probably need another one.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.834
It's awesome, man. Thank you. But...

21:30.920 --> 21:33.674
I mean, all my best stuff
was in my last sketch book.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.114
Comics, inventions.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.995
Expertly drawn boobs.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.072
Those were realistic.

21:39.720 --> 21:40.710
I think.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.870
I hope.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.395
But the Vinlothians. Like...

21:44.480 --> 21:47.195
you made the Star Cruiser.
You made their planet.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.351
You even came up with their battle cry.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.475
- What was it?
- Grak-tung.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.755
- Grak-freakin'-tung!
- All right.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.593
And, like, their language.

21:55.680 --> 21:58.115
- The star cruiser night club.
- Shh!

21:58.200 --> 22:00.112
Could you lower your voice, please?

22:00.200 --> 22:01.554
- What for?
- I said, "Shh."

22:01.640 --> 22:02.869
What?

22:02.960 --> 22:04.553
Okay, you don't want them
to know I'm here.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.630
Yeah. No offense,

22:05.760 --> 22:07.831
but Mom doesn't think
you're the best influence.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.798
Oh, okay. Well, she's not
wrong about that.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.674
Okay, Rafe.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.592
Back to the book thing.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.875
Are you ready for the greatest idea

22:17.960 --> 22:19.838
in the history of ideas?

22:20.480 --> 22:22.755
Dwight trashed your book, right?

22:22.840 --> 22:26.275
So, you trash his.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.675
Yeah, I guess that could be kind of fun.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.989
We'd take the shredder from the back...

22:29.080 --> 22:30.635
No, no, no.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.355
We don't wanna shred the rule book.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.075
We wanna shred the actual rules.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.275
Every stupid rule
in his dumb code of conduct.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.155
Leo, are you kidding me?

22:40.240 --> 22:41.555
And get kicked out of another school?

22:41.640 --> 22:42.994
I would be disowned.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.912
No, you won't. You wanna know why?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.152
'Cause we're gonna be careful
and nobody's gonna know it's us.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.915
So, you're saying we do it anonymously?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.559
Exactly!

22:54.200 --> 22:57.555
It is up to us to speak for the voiceless,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.915
to be vigilantes for freedom.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.555
We've got eight weeks before
Dwight tries to measure our worth

23:02.640 --> 23:04.791
on a bunch of bubbles on a Scantron.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.113
I'm sick of people trying to
suck the fun out of childhood.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.195
Let's stop the suck!

23:10.280 --> 23:13.034
Let's show them that we don't give a...

23:14.960 --> 23:16.394
What rhymes with suck?

23:16.480 --> 23:17.755
- Nothing good.
- So?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.632
- Let's stick it to the man.
- Yeah!

23:27.720 --> 23:30.360
# I stare at you for so long #

23:32.480 --> 23:35.075
# You watched me just as strong #

23:35.160 --> 23:37.470
# It feels right being wrong #

23:38.200 --> 23:40.235
# Never thought I'd get you, no #

23:40.320 --> 23:42.676
# But here you are at my front door #

23:43.240 --> 23:44.875
# The more you get #

23:44.960 --> 23:48.112
# It doesn't matter
if you're feeling it... #

23:59.840 --> 24:01.115
Hi!

24:01.200 --> 24:02.395
Hi, Mom.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.595
Uh... look at you.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.751
You're all dressed and ready
for school. What's going on?

24:05.880 --> 24:08.554
Uh, I'm just excited
to get to school early.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.632
- Really?
- Yeah. Of course.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.990
There's something sticking on your shoe.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.269
What is this?

24:28.160 --> 24:29.594
What is this?

24:32.320 --> 24:33.913
No.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.554
Oh, my.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.074
Hey, Gus.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.914
Gus!

24:44.120 --> 24:45.236
Yes?

24:47.240 --> 24:50.074
Whoever did this
was committed to their art.

24:58.880 --> 24:59.870
Get to class.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.755
This is not a gallery.

25:02.840 --> 25:03.956
And that's not art.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.560
Move it.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.155
"Rules aren't for everyone."

25:17.240 --> 25:18.674
What did you just say?

25:22.880 --> 25:24.195
"Rules aren't for everyone."

25:24.280 --> 25:26.475
Rule number 11, "No loitering."

25:26.560 --> 25:28.153
Move it, people.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.390
Grak-tung!

25:40.960 --> 25:42.633
- Hey, Miller!
- Hey!

25:45.240 --> 25:46.959
What are you staring at, Crap-a-dukian?

25:47.600 --> 25:48.795
Nothing.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.035
Uh-oh. You know what that is?

25:52.120 --> 25:55.079
That's the "kickter scale,"
and it's acting up.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.795
You know, it's still a good day.

25:57.880 --> 25:58.870
Okay, everybody.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.714
Time for our daily dose
of morning propaganda.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.715
Rules, regulations, respect.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.679
- Rules, regulations, respect.
- Principal Dwight?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.360
Principal Dwight?

26:16.120 --> 26:17.110
We're live.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.070
Oh, my God.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.155
Good morning, Hills Village.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.072
You may have noticed
on your way into school today

26:26.160 --> 26:29.677
that many surfaces were covered
in brightly-colored pieces of paper.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.275
This was a horrible act of vandalism.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.275
Rest assured, I will find the hooligans
who defaced our school in this manner.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.315
And when I find them, they'll be sorry,

26:43.400 --> 26:46.675
because I will punish them in ways
that I haven't even dreamed up yet.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.594
There will be no further distractions
to our B.L.A.A.R preparation.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.672
The microphone is on the fritz, sir.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.830
You may wanna wrap it up.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.232
I... like... my... big... but...

26:59.320 --> 27:01.676
Do... you... like... my... big... but...

27:03.200 --> 27:04.190
Oh, my God.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.714
Remember what I always say,

27:05.800 --> 27:08.554
do whatever I tell you, every single time.

27:09.640 --> 27:10.835
I thought that went all right.

27:18.040 --> 27:22.239
# Do you remember when we were young? #

27:30.080 --> 27:31.833
I can tell you want my '65 Shelby Cobra,

27:31.960 --> 27:32.950
but guess what?

27:33.800 --> 27:34.950
It's mine.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.793
I won it.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.755
I won it.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.354
- And then, you took it.
- No.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.556
You won it with my money.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.315
So, technically, it's mine.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.995
Plus, I beat you at Speed of Light.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.833
Boo-yah!

27:47.920 --> 27:49.752
Hey, look! It's a talking bear!

27:49.840 --> 27:51.069
Why do you insist on calling me that?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.515
You know my name is Carl. Carl.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.590
Well, A,

27:54.680 --> 27:57.070
"Carl" rhymes with "snarl,"

27:57.160 --> 27:58.913
which is something bears do.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.435
And, B, you're, like, abnormally hairy.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.193
Just hurry up, all right?

28:04.280 --> 28:06.155
"Game of Thrones" starts in 10 minutes.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.435
And if I miss the recap,
I'm totally screwed.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.475
Wait, but we haven't even had dessert yet.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.195
That's the best part!

28:12.280 --> 28:14.430
You better change your mindset
on this whole dessert thing, all right?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.795
Or you're gonna end up as fat as your dog.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.149
That's probably why you're so farty.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.955
Your face is farty.

28:19.040 --> 28:23.193
And Calvin Giggles is just big-boned.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.397
Just chew so we can get out of here, huh?

28:26.560 --> 28:28.233
Hi, folks, I'm Dana.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.960
I'll be taking over for Sandy.
Her shift just ended.

28:31.680 --> 28:32.830
Would you like me to bring the check?

28:32.920 --> 28:34.274
- Yes.
- No.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.714
I thought you were in a hurry.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.280
Yeah.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.515
A hurry to get you adorable kids

28:39.600 --> 28:41.635
the best dessert Dave
and Buster's has to offer, huh?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.030
Got my friend's kids with me today.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.235
Did you just say your "friend's kids"?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.710
Tell you what. Just get whatever
you guys want for dessert, all right?

28:48.800 --> 28:50.154
Provided it's not caviar, huh?

28:50.240 --> 28:51.555
I'll go grab the dessert menus.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.630
All right! Dessert.

28:52.720 --> 28:53.949
She's gonna grab the dessert menus.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.473
All right, here's the deal.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.355
- I am gonna go take a dump.
- Ew.

29:00.440 --> 29:02.318
Don't screw anything up, all right?

29:10.760 --> 29:11.910
Oh!

29:12.000 --> 29:12.990
Yeah.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.960
There we go. That's the stuff.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.554
Salt and pepper. Nice!

29:21.600 --> 29:23.395
Hey! Slow down!

29:23.480 --> 29:24.875
Where you going, huh?

29:24.960 --> 29:26.952
I just wanna get some honey, honey.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.875
Oh, honey?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.595
I got your honey right here.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.796
All right!

29:33.400 --> 29:34.993
Oh, what the...

29:35.080 --> 29:36.355
Ow!

29:36.440 --> 29:38.432
Ah! What is that smell?

29:41.400 --> 29:42.959
Oh, come on!

29:53.120 --> 29:55.675
This gets me so mad!

29:55.760 --> 29:57.194
I have an idea.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.953
Let's pee in his cologne.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.355
No, we can't do that.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.238
That would be way too much
of an improvement.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.955
Why are there so many jerks
in my life right now?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.030
I don't know.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.155
Whoa! It looks like we've just received

30:09.240 --> 30:11.595
a generous donation from one of them.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.955
What?

30:13.600 --> 30:14.590
Is that...

30:14.680 --> 30:16.751
Yep. Bear's credit card number.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.195
How nice of Bear to fund phase two

30:19.280 --> 30:21.475
of Operation Rules Aren't For Everyone.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.995
And maybe some new kicks.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.875
Forget drawing.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.555
You may be missing your calling
as an electrical engineer.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.478
Or a bank robber.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.115
Seriously, I think I'm learning more

30:36.200 --> 30:37.190
by breaking the rules

30:37.280 --> 30:39.272
than I ever have by preparing
for some dumb test.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.794
# Hear a knock on the door
and the night begins #

30:55.000 --> 30:58.755
# 'Cause we done this before
so you come on in #

31:00.200 --> 31:03.750
# Make yourself at my home,
tell me where you been... #

31:11.680 --> 31:13.875
# Baby take control now #

31:13.960 --> 31:16.429
# We can't even slow down #

31:16.560 --> 31:19.195
# We don't have to go out #

31:19.280 --> 31:21.555
# Welcome to my house #

31:21.640 --> 31:23.393
# Play that music too loud... #

31:23.480 --> 31:24.470
Oh, no! No!

31:30.800 --> 31:33.793
# Morning comes and you know
that you wanna stay #

31:35.560 --> 31:36.550
# Close the blinds #

31:36.640 --> 31:39.792
# Let's pretend
that the time has changed #

31:40.800 --> 31:44.794
# Keep our clothes on the floor,
open up champagne #

31:45.960 --> 31:49.510
# Let's continue tonight,
come on, celebrate #

31:50.040 --> 31:52.077
# Welcome to my house... #

31:52.720 --> 31:53.710
Dude.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.915
I can't believe people
are actually into our work.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.071
Bro. We're trending, Rafe!

31:58.160 --> 32:00.550
This is the work of the legends.

32:00.640 --> 32:01.790
Hey.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.436
Done.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.315
I wish there was one person
who I could share all this with.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.754
What, like, besides me?

32:10.840 --> 32:14.311
No way! Way too risky, man. Like, come on!

32:14.560 --> 32:17.155
"Dear diary, I'm a loser."

32:17.800 --> 32:19.393
It's not a...

32:19.960 --> 32:21.075
diary.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.992
Later, Khatcha-borian.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.599
Dream of Jeanne.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.909
- Can I have one?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.434
- Dream of Jeanne.
- Thanks.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.514
Hey, you're that guy.

32:38.640 --> 32:39.835
No, I'm not.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.354
The guy who clapped for my speech?

32:41.440 --> 32:43.635
Oh, yeah! That was me. I'm Rafe.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.120
Bam. That's one vote. That was easy.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.633
Can you believe that something this cool
is actually happening at our school?

32:50.720 --> 32:52.120
You think the graffiti is,
like, really cool?

32:52.240 --> 32:53.230
Well, not just that.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.834
I think the Post-it thing
was amazing, too.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.037
And Dwight's hair. Genius.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.355
I just love that someone has the guts,
you know, to take on the establishment.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.715
Yeah.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.790
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.032
Check out how many likes it got
on my Facebook page.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.235
Whoa!

33:07.320 --> 33:08.435
Yeah.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.989
That means that it's actually
spreading to other schools.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.755
Hey, um...

33:13.840 --> 33:15.274
do you wanna know a secret? I...

33:15.360 --> 33:16.915
Anonymous. You're anonymous.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.150
Actually...

33:18.240 --> 33:21.074
I'm really just digging your boots!

33:21.160 --> 33:22.275
Good job. Good choice.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.755
Thanks.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.235
So, what are you doing
after school next Friday?

33:25.320 --> 33:26.310
Well, uh...

33:26.440 --> 33:28.272
Do you wanna, like, go on a...

33:28.400 --> 33:29.795
- Fundraiser.
- Yeah, a date.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.395
A fundraiser. Totally.
That's what I was thinking.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.470
Yeah, I love funds.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.515
And raising things. Raising things is fun.

33:35.600 --> 33:37.671
What are we fund and raising for?

33:37.760 --> 33:39.315
- Greenpeace.
- Love them.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.715
Have you seen that
heartbreaking YouTube video

33:40.800 --> 33:42.553
about how the polar bears
are getting stranded

33:42.640 --> 33:44.871
- on melting ice floes?
- Yeah.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.195
And I'm trying to make a difference here,

33:46.280 --> 33:48.796
but it's just so crazy with the studying
for the testing of the B.L.A.A.R.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.832
And everyone's just so busy.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.593
Ugh, if I hear one more thing
about the B.L.A.A.R.,

33:52.680 --> 33:56.195
I'm gonna "blaarf" just, like, everywhere.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.590
Me, too.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.313
So, uh, you're in?

34:00.400 --> 34:03.632
Absolutely. I mean, I can "bear-ly" wait.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.590
Good.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.672
No, that was a dumb joke.
It was "bear-ly" because...

34:07.760 --> 34:10.275
Oh! Okay, yeah. I see what you did there.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.596
Actually, that was kind of funny.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.755
Okay, so, yeah.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.635
- I'll see you then.
- Okay.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.359
- Okay. Bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.036
Dude!

34:21.159 --> 34:22.355
You almost blew our cover!

34:22.440 --> 34:23.590
I'm sorry. She was just way cool, dude!

34:23.679 --> 34:25.672
You gotta be careful, okay?
Opening up to people can...

34:25.760 --> 34:27.752
well, it can get you hurt.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.114
- Am I right?
- Yes.

34:29.199 --> 34:30.714
You don't have to be such a jerk about it.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.553
I'm sorry. But, hey,
you can always trust me.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.074
One for all and all for one.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.674
We'll just massage this in

34:36.800 --> 34:39.074
and get you back to your natural color.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.913
Just lean back, relax,

34:41.000 --> 34:42.672
and let me take care of everything.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.672
Relax? I can't relax.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.399
Have you seen this website discussion?

34:46.520 --> 34:48.155
It's gone bacterial.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.275
Ugh! Even worse, ever since those punks

34:50.360 --> 34:51.755
started disrupting everything,

34:51.840 --> 34:54.071
the kids have been slacking off.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.913
This morning I heard laughing...

34:56.000 --> 34:57.229
in the library.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.232
Laughing? What do you mean?
The "out loud" kind?

34:59.320 --> 35:00.549
- Mm-hmm.
- And, you know,

35:00.640 --> 35:02.711
the test scores have really
been slipping this past month,

35:02.800 --> 35:04.712
ever since this rule breaking got started.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.115
- No.
- Yes.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.429
And the B.L.A.A.R.
is right around the corner.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.955
We can't afford to have our students
losing their concentration.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.915
Getting the best scores
on the test is all that matters.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.115
Like I always say,

35:14.200 --> 35:16.954
"Teach to the test, not to the kids."

35:17.040 --> 35:20.351
Yeah. Well, it's a relief to be
around someone who gets it.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.074
You know, I think we need
a larger room for detention.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.389
The library's not good anymore.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.515
Maybe the cafeteria plus the gymnasium?

35:27.600 --> 35:28.715
Mm-hmm.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.154
Although, the gymnasium comes in handy...

35:34.440 --> 35:35.999
Oh, my God!

35:36.720 --> 35:38.393
That could've been me.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.035
All right!

35:42.160 --> 35:45.915
Shon has a homework question
about the food chain.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.993
So, why don't we band together
as a class and help him. Shon?

35:51.800 --> 35:52.790
Shon, are you having a panic attack?

35:52.920 --> 35:54.752
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah? Okay, so, just breathe.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.031
And remember the question
that you asked me earlier.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.475
Probably won't show up on the B.L.A.A.R.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.914
The B.L.A.A.R does not dictate

36:02.000 --> 36:04.469
everything that you need to know
from the real world.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.233
Now we're together
for a half hour every morning.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.390
We might as well make it count.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.711
Rafe, you spend all day drawing.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.755
Why don't you put that to good use
and come draw us a food chain?

36:12.840 --> 36:13.830
No, I'm good. I mean...

36:13.920 --> 36:15.715
I only work in pen anyways, so...

36:15.800 --> 36:18.554
No. I've seen your homework.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.950
It's done exclusively in invisible ink.

36:21.040 --> 36:23.191
Come on. Draw us the food chain.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.590
Walk us through it.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.269
Okay, well, the sun...

36:38.120 --> 36:41.315
shines down onto the grass,

36:41.400 --> 36:42.629
which keeps growing

36:42.760 --> 36:45.559
until a cow comes along and eats it.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.315
Always grass. Never pizza.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.875
That's the primary consumer.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.675
The cow gets nice and big.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.555
Huh? Hmm...

36:53.640 --> 36:55.791
According to this, a surprise pizza party

36:55.880 --> 36:57.792
is being held for me right there!

36:57.880 --> 36:59.951
And then, it gets taken
to a slaughterhouse.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.952
Great. Now I gotta act surprised.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.474
Okay, I'm surprised.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.275
And we use it to make
hamburgers and all that.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.670
- One day...
- Hey!

37:12.760 --> 37:16.470
...a hungry bully
with a bad haircut comes by,

37:16.560 --> 37:18.358
eats the hamburgers.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.155
That's the secondary consumer.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.072
But he keeps eating the hamburgers.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.471
He keeps eating and eating
and eating until he gets so fat,

37:27.560 --> 37:30.712
that he just sort of explodes.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.439
Ugh!

37:37.280 --> 37:41.035
Uh... but that is good for the maggots.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.435
- Yay!
- Whoo!

37:42.520 --> 37:44.034
Mm-mm, just like chicken.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.430
- Ooh, try the butt cheek.
- No, thank you.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.590
I'm having the pu pu platter.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.151
And then, in turn,
enrich the grassy field,

37:51.240 --> 37:53.914
which another cow comes along and eats.

37:54.040 --> 37:57.590
Ooh, an invitation to a surprise party?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.478
Outstanding!

38:00.920 --> 38:03.875
So, um, yeah. That's, uh, that's...

38:03.960 --> 38:06.191
that's my food chain.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.953
That is...

38:08.040 --> 38:10.995
very detailed and super awesome.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.070
Thank you.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.513
All right, everybody, you know
what that sound means.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.795
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.439
Let's go. Out, out, out.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.515
Hey. Khatcha-drawian.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.910
I'm gonna roundhouse you in the face.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.675
- Do it.
- Do what?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.315
Roundhouse him.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.834
Roundhouse him in the face.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.115
'Cause I don't think you can.

38:32.200 --> 38:36.314
I don't think it's physically
possible to get your leg that high

38:36.400 --> 38:37.675
from where you're standing.

38:37.760 --> 38:38.750
Well...

38:40.600 --> 38:43.475
I know I can't. If I tried to do
it, my groin would snap like that.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.914
Of course I can.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.560
But I just can't do it now, because, uh...

38:48.720 --> 38:50.915
I forgot to renew the lethal weapon

38:51.000 --> 38:52.715
registration on my feet.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.792
Yeah, that's a bummer.
I hate it when that happens.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.111
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.316
So...

39:03.280 --> 39:05.920
- Gotta go.
- Okay. We'll rain check it.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.915
Look, there's no easy way
to break up with someone.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.435
But if you feel that
you weren't into it anymore,

39:14.520 --> 39:15.555
then you did the right thing.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.275
You had to tell her.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.235
You know? You gotta do you.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.715
That's the most important thing.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.836
I learned that from my ex-wife.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.191
Hey, uh, Rafe, um,

39:24.280 --> 39:25.873
that was some drawing back there.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.679
Oh. Thanks. It was nothing.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.474
No, it was very much something.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.035
What's a kid like you doing lumped in

39:32.120 --> 39:34.112
with all these other kids?

39:37.600 --> 39:39.796
It's been a rough couple of years for me.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.234
I lost my brother. Cancer.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.317
Oh, man.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.915
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.151
You guys are making me
a little nervous standing here.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.833
Remember rule number 34.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.315
Don't touch the trophy case?

39:56.400 --> 39:58.153
Very, very good.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.355
See what a favor I did you,
getting rid of that awful notebook

40:00.440 --> 40:02.193
so you can make more
productive use of your time?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.634
Right?

40:07.120 --> 40:10.033
Is there something you'd like
to say to me right now?

40:17.720 --> 40:18.949
You're in trouble.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.952
Give me your hand real quick, 'cause there's
something going on here. What is this? Oh!

40:22.040 --> 40:23.918
Oh!

40:27.720 --> 40:29.871
Bear is mauling our mother.

40:29.960 --> 40:30.995
We've got to do something.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.955
Hey, Mom! Open my present.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.633
Oh, I gotta go.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.195
Let me see that. Okay.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.475
Ah.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.550
Ooh. Presents.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.710
Let's see.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.839
Oh, it's an apron.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.550
What's this?

40:43.640 --> 40:45.871
"Hello, is it me you're cooking for?"

40:47.040 --> 40:48.995
- Isn't that funny?
- This is so funny.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.275
Where'd you find that?

40:50.360 --> 40:51.835
Well, I had someone make it for you.

40:51.920 --> 40:52.990
- You did?
- Yeah.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.070
You understand that?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.310
Of course, that's why I got it.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.754
- Get it?
- I get it.

40:56.840 --> 40:57.830
Honey, that's so cute. I love it.

40:57.920 --> 40:58.990
Took me a bit, but I got it. I think.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.070
I love it!

41:00.160 --> 41:01.355
So, "looking for" is "cooking for."

41:01.440 --> 41:02.635
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.791
- Hello. I'm James, the manager.
- Hi.

41:04.880 --> 41:07.835
Can we just keep it down, a lot?

41:07.920 --> 41:09.559
- Oh.
- This is not Chuck E. Cheese.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.915
Shh!

41:12.000 --> 41:14.117
Big guy. Shh!

41:14.240 --> 41:15.515
Can I have another root beer?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.193
You've had enough sugar.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.675
- Jeez.
- Jeez. He was scary.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.592
Do me a favor though, guys, seriously.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.512
Don't embarrass me again.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.555
We just have to talk like this
for the rest of the night, okay?

41:27.640 --> 41:29.472
No problem. Okay?

41:29.560 --> 41:31.595
You know, honey, I love my present.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.592
You always know how to make me laugh.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.070
- Thank you.
- This one's my present.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.231
Oh! Homemade.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.030
Classy.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.279
Rafe, I just...

41:48.520 --> 41:50.075
It's beautiful.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.435
- Honey, I love it.
- Thank you.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.034
You're so talented.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.351
You guys, you're too much.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.155
I love you so much!

41:58.240 --> 41:59.356
Wait. Where am I?

41:59.880 --> 42:01.355
Love you.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.475
Well, hold on a second now.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.835
Wait till you see what I got for you.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.475
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.233
Uh-oh.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.436
Jules...

42:09.200 --> 42:12.989
when I think about us,
I think about one word.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.560
Cramazing.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.235
- Crazy amazing.
- Right.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.879
- More like "crawful."
- Yeah.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.992
Oh.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.352
Carl...

42:26.480 --> 42:28.233
- Uh-huh.
- ...that must have been expensive.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.277
It was!

42:30.400 --> 42:32.278
Yeah. But guess what?

42:33.320 --> 42:34.913
- You're worth it, baby.
- Wow.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.516
So, what do you say, my lady?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.320
Will you marry me?

42:46.920 --> 42:48.752
- Yes. Yes.
- Hmm?

42:48.840 --> 42:50.315
- Yes.
- Yes.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.515
- You said yes.
- I did.

42:51.600 --> 42:52.954
Yes! Come here.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.872
Yes! Yes!

42:54.960 --> 42:56.235
You know, I was thinking,

42:56.320 --> 42:57.834
since I'm over at the house so much,

42:57.920 --> 43:00.560
and I'm always helping out
with the kids and everything,

43:00.680 --> 43:02.990
I ought to just move in, you know?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.070
I mean, I'd save a ton on mileage.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.231
And tax-wise, it's a no-brainer.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.595
Well, I mean, if we're gonna
get married, it seems like...

43:08.680 --> 43:09.995
Yes.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.195
Right. Then it's settled!

43:11.280 --> 43:12.714
Yes! Come here, you!

43:13.600 --> 43:14.915
Oh!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.832
Oh, sorry.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.832
Sorry about that, sporto.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.277
Oh, hey, your card got ruined. Bummer.

43:27.520 --> 43:28.510
I'm moving in!

43:29.680 --> 43:31.114
You're welcome.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.749
What's the matter, sport? Not hungry?

43:37.600 --> 43:38.636
Ugh!

43:38.760 --> 43:41.116
I'll show you a real breakfast.

43:42.800 --> 43:43.950
Honey!

43:46.840 --> 43:48.795
- Ugh!
- This stuff is delicious.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.360
Good talk, buddy.

43:53.480 --> 43:54.994
Nice!

43:55.080 --> 43:56.594
Sweet!

43:57.840 --> 43:59.832
Georgia!

44:04.080 --> 44:07.152
Your fat dog peed all over my Joey Banks.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.754
I have to admit something.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.194
It wasn't just him.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.873
I did it, too.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.234
All right, listen up, twerps,
and listen good.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.834
I'm here to stay.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.555
And that smile on your mom's face

44:20.640 --> 44:21.835
that you're all so happy to see?

44:21.920 --> 44:24.071
I put that there.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.635
So, unless you wanna be responsible

44:25.720 --> 44:26.915
for her unhappiness,

44:27.000 --> 44:28.912
I suggest you check your attitude

44:29.000 --> 44:31.310
and your bladder at the door.

44:31.400 --> 44:35.075
Because now, you're guests

44:35.160 --> 44:36.514
in the bear cave.

44:36.600 --> 44:39.035
At least he's embracing
the whole "Bear" thing now.

44:41.360 --> 44:43.192
Hey, what do these go with?

44:43.280 --> 44:46.273
They're zebra print.
They go with everything!

44:47.640 --> 44:49.279
We're doomed.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.115
I gotta do something, man.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.155
Well, one jerk at a time, Rafe.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.195
If I've learned anything
from Call of Duty,

44:57.280 --> 44:59.351
besides how to curse in 13 languages,

44:59.440 --> 45:01.395
it's that we've got
to complete this operation

45:01.480 --> 45:03.312
before we launch up the new one.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.869
I know. I just wish she could
see what a jerk he is

45:05.960 --> 45:08.395
underneath all that fancy stuff.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.355
Any last words?

45:11.440 --> 45:13.511
I think he says "gurgle."

45:16.880 --> 45:18.515
Hey, after this,

45:18.600 --> 45:20.512
I think we should tackle rule 86.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.593
Are you kidding?
Let's 86 the 86 talk, all right?

45:24.360 --> 45:25.675
The longer you wait,

45:25.760 --> 45:27.592
the scarier it's going to be.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.074
Uh, hand me the eel.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.112
Yeah.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.992
Somebody better update Wikipedia.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.070
You wanna know why?

45:38.160 --> 45:39.879
'Cause we're making history, bro.

45:46.760 --> 45:47.750
What the...

45:48.400 --> 45:50.039
Fish!

45:58.520 --> 46:00.512
Way to go, bro.

46:00.600 --> 46:02.159
Oh, my God.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.153
Who would do this?

46:06.080 --> 46:08.675
Gus, we have a situation in the lobby!

46:08.760 --> 46:10.433
Bring a net!

46:12.280 --> 46:14.237
Get to class!

46:21.240 --> 46:22.435
The fish, I can understand,

46:22.520 --> 46:24.155
but why did it have to be an eel?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.596
It looks just like the eel I had
when I was a boy.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.474
And that thing shocked me
every time I tried to pet him.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.115
All right! I gotta go on live.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.190
Right now.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.835
Okay. Um...

46:33.920 --> 46:35.673
Did you fix this thing?

46:35.760 --> 46:38.070
- Yes, but, uh...
- But what?

46:39.480 --> 46:40.955
That shirt...

46:41.040 --> 46:43.155
I'm just saying,
it might be a problem, sir.

46:43.240 --> 46:44.230
I didn't come here

46:44.360 --> 46:45.714
for a fashion consultation, Galleta.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.439
Just roll tape!

46:51.440 --> 46:52.954
Attention, Falcons!

46:53.080 --> 46:54.753
As you know, some punks

46:54.840 --> 46:57.514
have declared war on your education.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.035
And your education, through me,

47:02.120 --> 47:04.840
is about to start fighting back!

47:06.240 --> 47:08.914
Their punky little pranks and stunts

47:09.000 --> 47:10.315
have distracted our students,

47:10.400 --> 47:13.275
damaged our reputation
on the World Wide Web,

47:13.360 --> 47:15.352
endangered our number one status,

47:15.440 --> 47:18.315
and traumatized an eel.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.955
And so, today, it stops.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.235
If these little vandals

47:22.320 --> 47:24.630
don't like playing by our old rules,

47:24.720 --> 47:27.554
well, I guess I'll have
to come up with some new ones.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.075
Here come some new rules!

47:30.200 --> 47:31.995
Rule number 137,

47:32.080 --> 47:33.673
no more going to the bathroom.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.433
The bathrooms will be locked from now on.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.113
You'll have to hold it until you get home.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.590
I've never been wild about people
using the bathroom here.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.034
And now, it's over.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.760
Violators will be forced
to stay after school

47:43.880 --> 47:46.873
and clean the toilets.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.514
New rule 138, there will be
no after-school activities.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.751
That bell rings and you go straight home.

47:53.840 --> 47:54.875
You'll want to anyway,

47:54.960 --> 47:56.835
because you'll have to go to the bathroom

47:56.920 --> 47:58.354
pretty bad.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.475
I'll also be dissolving school government,

48:00.560 --> 48:02.233
something I should've done
a long time ago.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.789
It's been a puppet regime
all this time anyway.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.395
No debate, no speech,
no clubs of any kind,

48:07.480 --> 48:09.915
including the audio-visual club.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.275
Oh, sh...

48:16.640 --> 48:18.552
Don't you see, Rafe?

48:18.640 --> 48:22.156
My school, my rules.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.635
B.L.A.A.R.

48:28.720 --> 48:30.755
Sorry, we're at nerd capacity.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.957
Hey! Occupado.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.320
B.L.A.A.R.

48:37.680 --> 48:41.151
B.L.A.A.R., B.L.A.A.R.

48:44.160 --> 48:45.753
B.L.A.A.R.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.550
B.L.A.A.R.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.789
Oh! Oh!

48:58.800 --> 48:59.790
Huh?

49:03.520 --> 49:04.670
B.L.A.A.R.

49:07.960 --> 49:10.600
Hey!

49:23.880 --> 49:24.870
Well, look at this.

49:24.960 --> 49:26.280
We're one week out from the test,

49:26.400 --> 49:29.632
and I do not like the scores
on this practice exam.

49:29.720 --> 49:32.835
78% proficient in English and 76 in math.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.957
Mm. These are not winning scores.

49:35.680 --> 49:39.195
I've been growing
my number one bush for a decade,

49:39.280 --> 49:41.192
and I do not intend to trim it.

49:41.840 --> 49:43.035
Ever!

49:43.120 --> 49:44.995
See, there's the problem right there.

49:45.080 --> 49:46.992
Rotating. Like a planet.

49:47.080 --> 49:48.395
Remember, there's no grav...

49:48.480 --> 49:49.630
Oh, Uranus is down.

49:49.720 --> 49:51.234
Miller, stop trying to stab Uranus.

49:51.320 --> 49:54.755
The good kids are working their tails off,
and these remedials are fooling around

49:54.840 --> 49:57.150
instead of memorizing and studying.

49:57.880 --> 49:59.675
I wonder what would happen if we excluded

49:59.760 --> 50:02.229
Mr. Teller's students from the test.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.913
Well, look at that. Wow.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.639
We jump right back up to number one.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.593
Too bad we can't stop 'em
from taking the test.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.760
Oh, yeah.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.273
Oh, we could stop them
from taking the test.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.160
Ida, I could kiss you!

50:22.720 --> 50:24.115
Hey, Gus!

50:24.200 --> 50:25.595
Would you fix that farting bell?

50:25.680 --> 50:27.715
I want my ding-dong back!

50:27.800 --> 50:28.836
We are all on thin ice.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.515
- Help save the polar bears.
- Ms. Galleta.

50:30.600 --> 50:31.954
I thought I was very clear.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.395
All club meetings have been
canceled until further notice.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.115
And that includes this... What is this?

50:36.200 --> 50:37.315
What club is this?

50:37.400 --> 50:38.955
This isn't just some meeting.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.755
Polar bears' lives are at stake here.

50:41.840 --> 50:42.830
Oh, please.

50:42.920 --> 50:44.635
Those bears need to learn
to take care of themselves.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.675
It's not like the ice caps
are going anywhere.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.194
That's exactly what it's like!

50:48.280 --> 50:49.794
Sounds like I need to talk
to your science teacher.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.515
None of that has been proven.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.635
Oh, Rafe, I'm so glad you came.

50:53.720 --> 50:54.949
Of course. I mean, I wouldn't miss it.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.952
Well, you did miss it.
This meeting is over.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.350
Ms. Galleta is violating
one of my new rules.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.875
You're seriously trying
to put some stupid rule

51:01.960 --> 51:04.350
over the lives of innocent bear cubs?

51:04.440 --> 51:06.995
My rules aren't stupid.
Your bears are stupid.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.072
Nobody told them to live
on something that melts.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.152
And these animals are hardly innocent.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.630
Your beloved polar bears
would kill you for a peanut,

51:13.720 --> 51:14.835
or whatever they eat.

51:14.920 --> 51:16.274
What do polar bears eat?

51:16.360 --> 51:18.636
Ice? No way of knowing.

51:18.760 --> 51:20.315
And I am not
an unreasonable man, by the way.

51:20.400 --> 51:21.875
I might have overlooked one violation,

51:21.960 --> 51:24.395
but two violations has pushed it too far.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.153
This shirt of yours
goes against the dress code

51:26.240 --> 51:28.595
as stipulated in rule number 22.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.795
So, you've got detention. Two weeks.

51:30.880 --> 51:31.870
Principal Dwight,

51:31.960 --> 51:33.915
you can't dictate
what we wear after school.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.832
You're on my campus.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.230
And when you're on my campus,
you're under my rules.

51:38.320 --> 51:40.710
You're very close
to violating rule number one.

51:40.800 --> 51:42.275
Respect your principal.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.675
That's the most important rule.

51:43.760 --> 51:45.155
That's why I made it number one.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.879
Do you want a detention, too, huh?

51:50.600 --> 51:52.114
No, sir.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.315
I've got infinite detentions to hand out.

51:54.400 --> 51:55.390
You sure you don't want one?

51:56.000 --> 51:56.990
No, sir.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.955
Okay. Well, watch the attitude.

51:59.040 --> 52:00.554
Because I'd say the only thing around here

52:00.640 --> 52:02.438
that's on thin ice...

52:03.640 --> 52:05.757
is you, see?

52:07.880 --> 52:09.951
'Cause you've been talking about thin ice,

52:10.040 --> 52:12.714
and that's a way of saying
that someone is in trouble.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.794
I don't know what's going on with Rafe.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.951
He didn't even try my candied bacon tarts

52:23.040 --> 52:24.355
with goat cheese ganache.

52:24.440 --> 52:25.635
Ooh! More for me.

52:26.960 --> 52:30.914
You know, I just wish I knew
what was going on with him lately.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.509
Jules, I say this with love.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.432
Rafe is one messed up little dude.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.475
No, he's not. No. He's...

52:39.560 --> 52:41.074
he's dealing with a lot of stuff.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.355
Well, who isn't?

52:42.440 --> 52:44.315
I mean, I'm not, 'cause I'm awesome.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.389
But I do think little dudes that
are too attached to their moms...

52:47.480 --> 52:48.470
Please, no. What?

52:48.600 --> 52:50.555
They're more considerate, and kinder,

52:50.640 --> 52:51.790
and have empathy towards others?

52:51.880 --> 52:53.275
Exactly.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.155
They're soft.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.230
Look, I'm just saying.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.675
I think therapy might be a good idea.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.513
You know, a professional
that he can talk to,

53:00.600 --> 53:03.513
to help him deal with things better.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.193
Yeah. Maybe.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.636
You really think it could help
if he saw someone on a weekly basis?

53:09.600 --> 53:12.155
Weekly, on a daily basis maybe.

53:12.240 --> 53:14.311
- Huh?
- Hmm?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.955
Yeah. Yeah, no, you know what?

53:16.040 --> 53:17.713
I'll do the research for you, huh?

53:17.800 --> 53:19.275
That way, you can focus on work.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.272
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:22.040 --> 53:24.794
Babe, I'm here for you.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.519
I have to tell you, it's such a relief

53:26.640 --> 53:29.109
to have someone else to share all the...

53:29.200 --> 53:31.476
I'm sorry. Game's on.

53:31.600 --> 53:33.592
- Oh! Oh.
- Yeah. Thanks.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.034
Get back to the game.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.440
Okay. Yeah.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.355
Phone lady,

53:47.440 --> 53:51.070
find military schools
for kids you don't like.

53:51.160 --> 53:52.635
I find no Applebee's in your area.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.595
That's not what I... I didn't... Hey!

53:54.680 --> 53:56.273
All right, search for ways

53:56.360 --> 53:58.079
to get rid of kids that aren't yours.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.275
Calling Mommy.

54:00.360 --> 54:02.315
No. Don't call Mommy mobile.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.471
What? Stop, stop, stop!
Hang up! Hang up! Hang up!

54:04.560 --> 54:06.313
Hey, Mom!

54:06.400 --> 54:07.675
Carl, is that you again?

54:07.760 --> 54:08.796
No.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.550
I think we're breaking up.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.840
I'm breaking up. Gotta go.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.069
It's too easy.

54:25.280 --> 54:28.995
I'm just sick and tired of all these bullies
thinking they can do whatever they want.

54:29.080 --> 54:30.833
No risk, no reward.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.593
But we have to fight.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.835
Now that's a Musketeer thing to say.

54:43.800 --> 54:47.075
You ready to witness
my greatest masterpiece?

54:47.160 --> 54:48.795
Hey, Rafe, are you okay up there?

54:48.880 --> 54:51.111
Because if you fall, I am not
giving you mouth-to-mouth.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.711
Good. Thanks in advance.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.273
All of this for a girl?

54:57.360 --> 54:58.874
Is she really worth it?

55:00.760 --> 55:01.875
Leo,

55:01.960 --> 55:04.714
for Jeanne Galleta,
I would walk through fire

55:04.800 --> 55:06.154
just to see her smile.

55:09.800 --> 55:10.870
Grak-tung.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.835
Grak-tung.

55:20.360 --> 55:21.635
Rafe.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.955
Jeez, Georgia, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?

55:25.040 --> 55:26.110
Where have you been?

55:26.200 --> 55:28.431
It's none of your business. Now go to bed.

55:28.520 --> 55:29.954
Can't sleep.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.793
Wanna know why?

55:31.880 --> 55:33.030
Because I'm worried about you.

55:34.440 --> 55:37.160
Are you happy?
You've turned me into a grandma.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.075
Georgia, you're gonna need
at least, like, five cats

55:40.160 --> 55:41.795
before you're officially a grandma.

55:41.880 --> 55:44.520
Rafe, this is serious.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.792
Georgia, don't cry.

55:49.880 --> 55:50.870
Okay? I'm fine.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.394
No, you're not.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.355
You're secretive.

55:54.440 --> 55:57.353
And when you're not sad, you're angry.

55:58.120 --> 56:01.033
I came in here tonight to warn you.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.395
I don't know
what you're up to every night,

56:03.480 --> 56:05.551
but it has to stop, whatever it is.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.515
Because if Bear catches you,

56:07.600 --> 56:08.590
he's gonna ship you off

56:08.680 --> 56:11.275
to some military school for bad kids.

56:11.360 --> 56:12.714
Wait, what?

56:12.800 --> 56:15.435
I heard him talking about it
with Mom tonight.

56:15.520 --> 56:17.989
He has her believing
you're really messed up.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.719
He's the one that's messed up.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.112
Rafe, listen to me.

56:22.200 --> 56:24.192
He has it out for us.

56:25.240 --> 56:27.391
And I know I talk a big game...

56:28.040 --> 56:30.635
but I can't handle him all by myself.

56:32.040 --> 56:35.511
Please, Rafe. Promise me.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.115
No more trouble. Please.

56:38.800 --> 56:41.155
Fine. I promise.

56:41.240 --> 56:42.720
No more trouble.

56:55.520 --> 56:56.670
Thanks, dork.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.638
Yeah, whatever, loser.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.675
Dude, this next one is gonna
put us over a million hits.

57:07.760 --> 57:10.594
I'm not gonna do it, all right?
I promised Georgia.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.395
But you gotta do it.

57:12.480 --> 57:14.278
The B.L.A.A.R.'s tomorrow.
We can't let up now.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.315
Listen. They fixed the bell.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.755
It's gonna be like
none of this even happened.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.752
Look, Leo, we're just kids. Okay?

57:22.840 --> 57:24.513
Dwight was always gonna win.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.432
But what happened to making a difference?

57:27.520 --> 57:29.432
What happened to not being pushed around,

57:29.520 --> 57:30.874
and fighting for your freedom?

57:30.960 --> 57:33.111
Okay, Dwight, Bear, Miller? They happened.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.235
And I'm not trying to make a difference.

57:35.320 --> 57:37.198
I'm trying to make it
through middle school.

57:38.800 --> 57:39.790
Well, gang,

57:39.880 --> 57:42.835
this is going to be harder
on you than it is on me.

57:42.920 --> 57:46.035
I'm afraid I have reason
to believe that this classroom

57:46.120 --> 57:48.235
is the epicenter for the vicious pranks

57:48.320 --> 57:50.515
our school has endured this semester.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.875
In fact, this entire class
is under suspicion.

57:54.960 --> 57:57.077
That's a pretty serious
accusation there, Dwight.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.874
Well, it's a pretty serious offense.

57:59.960 --> 58:01.713
And I have proof.

58:02.720 --> 58:03.710
Come with me.

58:07.480 --> 58:08.675
Spray paint.

58:09.280 --> 58:10.595
Pink hair dye.

58:10.680 --> 58:12.433
Fish food.

58:12.520 --> 58:13.510
Post-it notes.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.831
And balls.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.715
Effective immediately,

58:20.800 --> 58:24.396
all of your students
are suspended for one week!

58:24.520 --> 58:25.510
What?

58:25.600 --> 58:27.319
- No!
- Wait a minute.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.874
These kids may be troublemakers,

58:28.960 --> 58:30.355
they may not be "A" students,

58:30.440 --> 58:31.995
a lot of them smell weird,

58:32.080 --> 58:33.514
but they are smart enough to know

58:33.600 --> 58:36.475
you don't leave hard evidence
inside their lockers.

58:36.560 --> 58:40.076
These are hardly the masterminds
of such an extravagant prank.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.192
If anything, I would say

58:42.280 --> 58:43.755
that this seems like a setup.

58:43.840 --> 58:46.674
Are you insinuating that this is a setup?

58:46.760 --> 58:50.035
Yeah. That's why I just said
this seems like a setup.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.315
I don't like that.

58:51.400 --> 58:54.472
Because it almost sounds like
you're thinking this is a setup.

58:54.560 --> 58:55.755
I think before we do anything,

58:55.840 --> 58:58.071
like suspend anybody
or anything like that,

58:58.160 --> 58:59.475
we talk to someone
who has some real authority,

58:59.560 --> 59:00.914
like Superintendent Hwang.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.673
Oh, I have real authority, Mr. Teller.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.274
I'm the principal at this school.

59:04.360 --> 59:07.473
Yeah, but, like, someone who has,
like, real power to make decisions.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.711
That's what I have,
power to make decisions.

59:09.800 --> 59:12.555
Let's talk to the person that,
like, can make something happen.

59:12.640 --> 59:13.960
Mm.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.514
You know, Mr. Teller,
your continued denials

59:17.600 --> 59:20.475
in the face of this overwhelming evidence

59:20.560 --> 59:21.550
leads me to believe

59:21.640 --> 59:23.435
that you must be involved somehow.

59:23.520 --> 59:27.639
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to fire you.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.235
You have a thousand other choices.

59:31.320 --> 59:32.310
I guess that's true.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.993
I probably do have
a few other choices, don't I?

59:35.280 --> 59:37.555
Well, the one I'm going with
is "fire you."

59:37.640 --> 59:40.470
All right, everyone, pack up all of
your things while we call your parents.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.029
And, Mr. Teller,
good luck finding another job.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.873
Without my recommendation, I'm afraid.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.635
I'm tired of that guy busting my balls.

59:48.720 --> 59:52.075
Yes, hello. I was thinking
of having a large number one

59:52.160 --> 59:53.514
tattooed onto my back.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.239
Is it necessary to make an appointment?

59:55.360 --> 59:57.591
Oh, okay. Well, what sorts
of openings do you...

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.355
Um... I need to call you back.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.635
Principal Dwight?

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.040
What are you still doing here?

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.355
I did it.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.669
You did what?

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.514
You destroyed my book,
so I wanted to destroy yours.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.034
"Rules Aren't For Everyone."

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.157
R-A-F-E, Rafe. Me.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.030
What?

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.440
Are you not making the connection?

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.195
Well, I'm pretty sure your name
is spelled with a "PH."

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.270
"Phrafe."

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.714
Your evidence is fake.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.034
Well, you know, Phrafe...

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.914
that evidence, uh, could be real.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.435
And I've seen the way
those other kids treat you.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.557
We could just make them go away.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.474
All you have to do
is keep your mouth shut.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.711
And you won't have to be suspended.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.553
Let them take the fall.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.470
This whole thing
will be our little secret.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.870
We have a deal?

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.310
You know what?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.720
Do whatever you want to me,

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.354
but keep everybody else out of this.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.475
And give Mr. Teller his job back, or else.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.880
Or else what?

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.235
What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.356
Don't step... Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.675
I'm gonna make it rain.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.955
No. Hey, no!

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:15.351
No, no, no, no, no, no! No! No!

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.555
# Ooh, girl, you're shining
like a 5th Avenue diamond #

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.995
I should have known a remedial
like you would make a dumb choice!

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.115
With this little stunt,

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.915
you've just violated rule number 28.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.593
No false fire alarms!

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.195
Rafe Katchadorian,
you are officially expelled!

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.395
Permanently!

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.110
Gus! Please turn off these sprinklers!

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.435
# Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye #

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.510
# Like Hathaway #

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.353
# Write a song for you like this #

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:47.710
# I'm out of my mind #

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.315
# Thinking I was born in the wrong time #

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.595
# One of a kind #

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.315
# Living in a world gone plastic #

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.153
# Baby, you're so classic #

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.912
# Baby, baby, you're so classic #

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.480
# Baby, you're so classic #

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.510
# Yeah, yeah #

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.590
# Baby, you #

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.715
# Baby, you're so classic #

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.755
# You're over my head,
I'm out of my mind #

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.875
# Thinking I was born in the wrong time #

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.675
# Let's start the rewind #

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.752
# Everything is so throwback age #

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.069
# I kinda like it, like it #

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.152
# Out of my league, old school chic #

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.195
# Like a movie star
from the silver screen #

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.634
# You're one of a kind #

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.275
# Living in a world gone plastic #

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.113
# Baby, you're so classic... #

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.710
Not joking about my towel now,
are you, sport, huh?

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.273
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.714
I would've lost money on you.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.349
You hung in there way longer
than I thought you would've.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.474
But, in the end,

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.995
you're still the loser I thought you were.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.510
Will you just listen to me? Please, Mom.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.954
Principal Dwight's
been out to get me since...

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.275
since the first day of school.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.591
Or maybe you decided he was
gonna to give you a hard time

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.592
and you were gonna
make it easy for him to do.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.149
No, that's not what happened, okay?

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.310
This principal is evil.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.435
And he suspended the whole class
even after I told him

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.395
that I'm the one that bent the rules.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.790
Bent? Rafe, I think you did a little more

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.950
than bend the rules.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.155
You're the one that told me
to think outside the box.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.835
But there's a big difference
between thinking outside the box

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.230
and totally demolishing it.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.715
If you were having problems
with the principal,

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.234
why didn't you talk to me first?

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.551
Because who'd believe the word of some kid

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.755
over the head of the whole school?

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.514
Honey, I would. I'm your mom.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.910
I could've tried talking to him at least.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.555
Now it's too late!

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.394
This was the last school
that would accept you.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.709
What are we supposed to do now?

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.110
Find another school in another state,
in another country?

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.190
I'm out of options!

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.397
And so, Carl found a school.
It's a boarding school.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.433
With some military aspects.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.830
You're sending me away
to some military school?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.315
Honey, I don't want to.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.955
But it's a place for kids like you

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.316
who have trouble with authority.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.155
I thought I'd take the day off tomorrow.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.038
Maybe we could just go take a look.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.314
Whatever.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.357
Oh, honey.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.434
We all miss him.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.476
- Mom, you don't have to...
- I miss him.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.719
Georgia does.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.199
Nothing's been the same
since the day he got sick.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.114
At times, I didn't know
if I could handle it.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.875
And...

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.235
your dad, well...

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.317
He obviously couldn't handle it.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.396
But it's worst for you.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.629
Brothers.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.837
You guys had such a bond.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.319
It was so different.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.320
And special.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.075
And I know sometimes

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.277
you pretend that he's still here.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.319
I know you pretend...

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.353
that Leo isn't gone.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.273
But he is, honey.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.680
Leo is gone.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.950
I'm sorry.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.311
I love you so much.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.312
I wish you knew how much.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.360
I love you, too.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.633
Hey, bro. Guess by now

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.872
I've taken that Vinlothian
space cruiser to the sky.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.953
And whatever I'm doing now,
it's probably a lot cooler

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.191
than what you're doing stuck in school.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.033
Kidding.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.873
Don't tell anyone, but I actually

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.395
kind of liked some of my classes.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.119
And since I'm confessing stuff,

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.153
I guess it's time to tell you
I've always looked up to you.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.515
You're super talented,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.635
and you can draw and create anything.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.075
So, imagine something cool for me.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.153
And then live something cool for you.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.913
Love, your younger brother,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.310
by one year and two months,

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.959
Leo.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.400
You gonna let me in, or what?

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.230
Uh...

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.675
Sorry. I wasn't expecting
anyone at the window.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.075
Yeah.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.435
I guess this is kind of weird.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.835
What are you doing here?

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.515
Well, you know, I just wanted
to make sure you were okay...

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.750
after today.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.314
Yeah, it was, um...

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.392
It was a total crapstorm of a day.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.392
Yeah, I know.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.790
But this was awesome.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.675
I kind of figured it was you all along.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.151
But then, I confirmed it
when I watched this.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.399
And what is that?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.115
A VHS tape.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.395
It's vintage.

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:46.790
Basically, it's like a box
that's full of an archaic system

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.234
of gears, pulleys, and tape,

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:50.993
that is then put in a larger box,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.832
called a VCR,

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.993
which then projects the images
onto the television.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.197
Wouldn't an iPhone be easier?

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:01.710
My phone doesn't have enough memory
for this kind of project.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.911
I secretly filmed the school

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.469
as a part of a documentary I did

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.870
to find the creator
of Rules Aren't For Everyone.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.158
Oh. Um...

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.274
Well, you found me, I guess.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.395
But too bad my art
didn't really change anything.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:23.234
Well, what I've got here
says you're wrong.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.752
You came prepared.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.675
Okay, so I put the camera
on top of a row of lockers

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.035
to get the best angle.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.157
You ready to witness
my greatest masterpiece?

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.069
Leo, for Jeanne Galleta,

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.517
I'd walk through fire
just to see her smile.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:42.630
Grak-tung.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.078
Who's Leo?

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:50.310
Um...

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.715
Leo's my, um...

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.120
he's my brother.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.278
But he's not just my brother,
he's my best friend.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.190
And he died.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.594
So, sometimes I like to...

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.435
imagine that he's still here,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.035
you know, whenever I'm lonely.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.830
It's stupid.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.035
I think it's the opposite of stupid.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.352
You know, Picasso once said,

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:24.990
"Everything you can imagine is real."

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.436
- I like that.
- Yeah, me too.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.360
Okay. Uh... look at this.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.909
There.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.310
Gus, open up those lockers.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.875
I don't like this.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.075
Oh, really?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.470
I wonder how you'll like unemployment.
Open them.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.990
Do it.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.912
Spray paint.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.394
This is horrible.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:53.675
Very hard to get out of the hair.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.274
You have evidence!

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.475
Oh, and get this.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.029
Not only does B.L.A.A.R. testing
give the school bragging rights,

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.352
but it also gives the principal
a significant bonus.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.113
So, suspending Teller's class

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.755
was just about getting
a better score for the B.L.A.A.R.?

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.911
Jeanne, we have to stop the test tomorrow.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.795
And we're definitely gonna need some help.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.109
I've got the numbers

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.155
of a few kids with no school tomorrow.

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.197
You text them,
and I'll set up transportation.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.070
Georgia.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.675
Georgia, wake up.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.194
You feel like a drive?

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.479
In the Bear trap?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.995
Mm-hmm.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.795
Yes, finally!

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.553
But we need a diversion.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.197
I know just the thing.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.955
Georgia, Jeanne.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.190
Jeanne, Georgia.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.714
I like your glasses.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.359
I like your dog.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.354
Thanks.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.517
Mm, mm, mm! Oh!

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.153
Ready, set, go, Mr. Giggles.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.280
Well, well, well.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.039
If it isn't the Great Fatsby.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.633
You want some steak there, boy?

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.635
Huh? Stay.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.275
Stay.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.430
Stay.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.477
Psych!

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.279
Whoo-hoo!

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.949
Yippee ki-yay!

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.475
I thought you said she could drive!

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.195
Oh, I can. I just thought Bear's car

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.634
could use a little body work.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.955
All right, guys. Tonight is the night.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.755
I've given you all your assignments.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.830
Any questions?

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.515
Hey, so all the rule breaking stuff,

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.274
the fish, fart bell, everything.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.760
That was really you?

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.230
Yeah.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.039
All right, Katchadorian.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.350
I'm in.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.155
Did you just say my name right?

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.913
Hey, Rafe. Who is that guy?

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:24.355
Oh, crap. It's Gus.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.352
Is it too late to run?

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.195
Turns out we're not the only ones

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.555
Dwight has pissed off one too many times.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.835
Kougeki kaishi!

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.391
Are you speaking words
or did you just have a stroke?

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.470
What?

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.595
- Wait, what?
- What?

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.555
It's a Japanese war cry.
"Begin the attack!"

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.313
All right, guys, come on!

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.436
Vamonos, muchachos!

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.275
# Can we go back? #

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.675
# This is the moment #

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.194
# Tonight is the night #

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.835
# We'll fight till it's over #

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.675
# So we put our hands up
like the ceiling can't hold us #

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.275
# Like the ceiling can't hold us #

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.395
# Can we go back? #

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.834
# This is the moment #

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.235
# Tonight is the night #

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.039
# We'll fight till it's over... #

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.080
Smile!

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.916
Oh, crap.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:41.435
Rafe, come on! It might not be that bad!

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.194
- Babe. What's going on?
- He won't come out of his room.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.833
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.075
All right. Well, look...

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.755
you go do whatever you gotta do,
and I'll take care of this.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.473
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.392
- Good luck.
- All right.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.831
Reveille! Let's go, turd!

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.910
Come on, let's go.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.151
Count of three, or I'm coming in, I swear!

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.035
One, two...

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.915
Good. I wanna come in.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.231
It tingles!

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.551
Now it burns!

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.711
Ohh, you gotta be kidding me!

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.634
What is that made of?

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.510
Oh...

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.670
Unbelievable.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.355
Ah! He's not even in here!

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:25.555
Oh, great. Now I gotta go out

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.195
and look for these little snots?

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.430
That's just what I wanna do.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.671
No, no. Come on!

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.989
Oh.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.315
What's wrong?

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.355
She's missing. The baby's gone.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.830
Oh, no. That's what you're so upset about?

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.795
- Yes!
- Well, don't worry.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.950
She probably went to a friend's house.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.474
I'll give Georgia a call.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.155
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.435
My car!

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.550
It's missing!

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.630
- Your car?
- Yes!

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.835
That's what you're so worked up about?

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.991
- Yes!
- You know what?

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.834
I must have been insane not to see

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.475
what a self-centered jerk you really are.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.870
Excuse me, I've got to go find my kids.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.350
# Can't touch this #

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.750
# Why you standing there, man? #

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.635
# Can't touch this #

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.473
# Ring the bell School's in, sucker #

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.313
# Break it down #

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.355
No, no, no!

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.915
Oh, my beautiful bush!

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.390
What did they do to you? Oh, no!

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.996
No, God, no! Oh!

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.036
Ohh.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.875
What are all the desks doing out here?

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.435
I don't know.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.000
What do we do?

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.040
Pencils up!

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.389
Act like this is part of the plan.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.595
Never show weakness, Ida.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.478
There's no sabotaging the B.L.A.A.R.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.796
And... begin!

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:57.230
"True or false...

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.035
22 Hills Village students

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.155
were suspended in order to rig this test?"

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:04.875
Hey, rule number 13,
"No talking during a test."

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.435
What's the problem here?

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.989
Well, it's just these questions
are kind of weird.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.356
Weird? What do you mean, weird?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.474
Oh.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.472
These are pretty weird.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.153
Hey. Just by a show of hands,

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.709
how many people have a test
that starts with the question,

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.075
"True or False,

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.629
Principal Dwight has three nipples"?

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.152
Well, that's a lot of you.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.390
Well, it's false.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.795
Put false!

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.634
I was born without nipples,
for your information.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.675
And it looks beautiful.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.274
Where are the real tests?

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.755
Hey!

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.399
Looking for these?

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.999
Blaarches!

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.075
Principal Dwight is a hypocrite

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.230
who likes to make the rules,

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.915
but thinks he's too good
to actually follow them himself.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.673
We have proof

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.434
that he planted evidence
in his own students' lockers.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.876
I have had just about enough of you!

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.272
No bike riding on campus.
I'm confiscating this.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.113
Get off! Get off of it!

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.639
How are you so fast?

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.513
Spin class. Four nights a week.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.353
Sometimes five.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.193
What's that's smell?

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.398
Just the same crap
Dwight's been shoveling at us.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.795
Ugh! Gross!

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.795
Can't this thing go any faster?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.713
Hey, that's my lunch!

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.830
Time to get in the game.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.555
You're gonna need a bigger bike.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.280
Tech support.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.513
Oh, no.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.280
Thought you could get away from me, huh?

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.190
Oh!

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.316
Oh! That's disgusting!

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.469
- What's going on here?
- It's all on this tape, ma'am.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.870
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a jerk.

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.031
Superintendent, Rafe is
a smart and talented kid.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.435
He deserves to be heard.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.796
He's actually not that smart.
He's pretty dumb.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.555
I've seen his records
from his previous schools.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.915
This kid tests like...

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.875
What is this obsession that we have

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.235
with testing and categorizing our kids?

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.313
I literally have no idea
what you are talking about.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.711
If we keep cramming standard
tests down our kids' throat,

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.951
we're gonna end up with
a bunch of standard children.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.075
I don't know what stinks more,
your attitude or my suit.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.073
And that's really saying something,
because my suit is covered in poop.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.475
Nobody cares what you think anyway.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.995
- I do.
- She does.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.475
Mr. Teller here has logged
a formal complaint

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.233
saying you rigged this test

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.039
and he's been unlawfully fired.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.837
Now, let's see that tape.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.790
Yes, ma'am.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.394
And the rules clearly state

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.040
that I have the right to a full hearing.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:10.753
Rigging state tests is a serious offense.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.830
You're done here.

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.035
I'll make sure you get
your full hearing, Dwight.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.915
- Take this.
- In a court of law.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.719
Let's get out of here, Ida.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.360
Thought you'd never ask.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.715
Ah.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.110
Green this time.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.951
- Georgia!
- Hey, Mom.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.997
I've been looking all over for you.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.351
What have you been doing, huh?

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:40.840
Come here.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.040
Oh!

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.190
Oh, man.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.995
You little snots are gonna pay for this!

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.390
No, I'll pay. With this.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.555
And keep the change.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.950
I hear Pier One's having a sale
on animal prints.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.475
I know you're saying that
just to be hurtful.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.795
But let me tell you something.

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.394
I get Google alerts from Pier One,

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.795
so I already knew about the sale.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.870
Joke's on you.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.634
You know, it's just sad.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.030
It's sad that some people, you,

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:15.079
can't handle all this
concentrated awesomeness, me!

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.429
Come on, guys, let's go.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.079
I'm Audi 5G.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.031
Leo! Dude, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.835
Are you kidding?

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.799
I couldn't miss the thrilling
conclusion of Operation R.A.F.E.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.516
And... I couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.632
Good-bye? Why are you saying good-bye?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.313
Things are just starting to get good.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.595
Listen...

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.911
I was just hanging around
until you made some real friends.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.675
Yeah, because of you.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.989
I wish I could take that credit,

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.754
but it was all you, Rafe.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.315
I'm gonna miss you.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.359
I know.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.870
Awesome!

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.111
You drew me a Vinlothian Space Cruiser?

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.510
You know what? I guess that's my ride.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.559
# I'll be a dreamer
till the day I die... #

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:30.435
Hey, Rafe. Grak-tung!

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.957
# Oh, how the good die young #

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.635
# But we're all strange #

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.519
# And maybe we don't wanna change #

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.435
# I got dreams in my head
and they won't go #

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.510
Grak-tung!

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.920
# Spirits in my head and they won't go #

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.794
# I got dreams in my head
and they won't go #

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.035
# Spirits in my head
and they won't go... #

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.790
I've heard you say that before.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.793
What does it mean?

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:02.430
Uh, it means, "Victory is ours."

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.275
Well...

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.635
almost.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.710
What?

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.235
I don't wanna ruin your sense
of accomplishment, but...

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.075
you didn't break every rule.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.951
Rule 86.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.475
Way to go, bro.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.472
Yuck.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.396
Grak-tung!

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.512
Oh!

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.275
B.L.A.A.R.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.192
Hey, come on!

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.395
# Ohh! #

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.075
# And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost #

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:41.150
# Living in my head #

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.635
# And there's a hope, hope, hope #

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.870
# Burning my bed #

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.713
# I'm young and wild #

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.994
# I'm young and wild #

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.037
# Ohh! #

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.393
# I jump out from an airplane #

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.153
# To see if I can fly #

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.875
# I lit a house on fire #

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.075
# Just to see a painted sky #

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.115
# Did you know, did you know #

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.034
# I've been running all my life? #

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.955
# Sometimes I say you're crazy #

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.111
# Sometimes I'll think you're strange #

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.230
# Maybe you're the one #

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.152
# Who found a way out of this cage #

01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:31.471
# Here we go, here we go #

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.394
# Let's go take apart this night #

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.595
# And it goes on, and on, and on, and on #

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:49.679
# And it goes on, and on, and on, and on #

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.795
# And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost #

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.030
# Living in my head #

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.475
# And there's a hope, hope, hope #

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.675
# Burning my bed #

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.433
# I'm young and wild #

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.317
# I'm young and wild #

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.315

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.550
# Living in my head #

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.915

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.115

# I'm young and wild #

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:22.392
# I walk the lines they made me #

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.115
# Just to make them smile #

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.915
# 'Cause every monster that they make #

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.832
# Was once a happy child #

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.715
# Did you know, did you know #

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.998
# We won't go without a fight? #

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.753
# They said that you'd be nothing #

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.635
# They said these dreams will die #

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.359
# But I stood strong and worked too hard #

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.435
# To keep this hope alive #

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.239
# Here we go, here we go #

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.990
# I'm gonna write my name in lights #

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:58.599
# And it goes on, and on, and on, and on #

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.515
# And there's a ghost, ghost, ghost #

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.829

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.195
