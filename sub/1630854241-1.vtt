It's dark in here

19:34.222 --> 19:36.518

I can't answer them, Matt.

-Get out of my room!

19:55.849 --> 19:57.310
Riley, I'm not trying...

19:58.562 --> 19:59.564
I love you.

19:59.649 --> 20:03.197
You love having something to fix,
so that you can feel like

20:03.280 --> 20:05.326
a big success
in this shitty apartment...

20:05.410 --> 20:07.580
Okay, I see what you're trying to do.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.461
No, you don't know a thing
about what I'm trying to do, I'm not...

20:10.545 --> 20:12.007
You know what? That's okay.

20:12.090 --> 20:13.467
-Neither do I.
-Okay.

20:13.593 --> 20:14.804
You're drunk.

20:15.221 --> 20:17.392
Yeah! Are you jealous?

20:17.935 --> 20:19.689
-Are you scared?
-Sleep it off.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.901

you will lose, Riley.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.136

Get the fuck out of my house.

that nobody even knew about,

Colin, get up!
I can't help you from here.

1:35:10.704 --> 1:35:12.581
You have to get up and go.

1:35:13.166 --> 1:35:14.252
Listen to me.

1:35:14.335 --> 1:35:16.966
-Okay.
-They're gonna come. You have to go!

1:35:17.049 --> 1:35:18.176
The gate's open.

1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:19.303
Hurry!

1:35:19.972 --> 1:35:20.974
Go!

1:35:24.397 --> 1:35:27.028
-VOIGHT: Watch him.
-Colin, Colin, Colin.

1:35:27.153 --> 1:35:30.242
-It's over, man. It's over.
-VOIGHT: Go, get up.

1:35:30.869 --> 1:35:32.288
We need him close by.

1:35:55.459 --> 1:35:58.131
VOIGHT: Yes. Take it.

1:35:58.716 --> 1:36:00.385
I give you their blood,

1:36:01.262 --> 1:36:02.389
their suffering.

1:36:09.570 --> 1:36:11.700
Come get it, you bastard.

1:36:13.453 --> 1:36:14.706
I'm still here

1:36:15.249 --> 1:36:17.712
and I demand an audience!

1:36:52.657 --> 1:36:53.826
TREVOR: Colin!

1:36:54.661 --> 1:36:55.663
Colin...

1:36:57.208 --> 1:36:58.418
It's over.

1:36:58.501 --> 1:37:00.422
Get back to the room
because they're coming.

1:37:04.221 --> 1:37:06.100
We're already here.

1:37:09.148 --> 1:37:10.652
(SHUDDERS)

1:39:05.798 --> 1:39:06.800
No.

1:39:07.342 --> 1:39:09.764
Your chains can't reach me here.

1:39:10.725 --> 1:39:13.856
Tell your God I've got its disciples.

1:39:14.523 --> 1:39:15.525
Its priest.

1:39:15.610 --> 1:39:17.529
What did you think? I built a fortress?

1:39:18.114 --> 1:39:19.993
I built a cage!

1:39:21.830 --> 1:39:26.840
And I'm not letting any of you go
until it makes me right again.

1:39:28.802 --> 1:39:30.890
You reject our gift.

1:39:31.683 --> 1:39:33.102
Fuck your gift!

1:39:33.186 --> 1:39:34.814
Fuck you!

1:39:34.981 --> 1:39:37.236
Now take it out of me.

1:39:38.948 --> 1:39:40.283
Remarkable.

1:39:41.202 --> 1:39:42.622
All this...

1:39:44.541 --> 1:39:46.254
All for us.

1:39:46.630 --> 1:39:48.592
No, not for you.

1:39:49.260 --> 1:39:50.638
For me.

1:39:50.721 --> 1:39:52.057
I get what I want.

1:39:52.516 --> 1:39:53.811
Then let us in

1:39:54.311 --> 1:39:56.650
to address your displeasure.

1:40:09.884 --> 1:40:11.012
What are you doing?

1:40:11.470 --> 1:40:12.640
Isn't it obvious?

1:40:13.057 --> 1:40:14.644
Wait. (GROANS)

1:40:50.215 --> 1:40:51.677
Just take it back.

1:40:56.519 --> 1:40:58.816
Just take it back.
I don't want it anymore.

1:41:01.570 --> 1:41:02.740
(SHUDDERS)

1:41:16.100 --> 1:41:17.436
(SCREAMS)

1:41:19.356 --> 1:41:20.400
Colin.

1:41:21.444 --> 1:41:22.571
Colin!

1:41:24.659 --> 1:41:26.078

1:41:33.384 --> 1:41:35.263
(SCREAMS ECHOING)

1:41:38.896 --> 1:41:40.023
Stop!

1:41:40.941 --> 1:41:42.277
VOIGHT: Just take it out.

1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:43.781
I don't want it anymore.

1:41:46.118 --> 1:41:48.665
Just let me die. I'm begging you.

1:41:48.749 --> 1:41:49.876
Just...

1:41:53.382 --> 1:41:54.677
Just let me die.

1:41:54.761 --> 1:41:56.514
There is no retreat.

1:41:56.598 --> 1:41:59.102
Once a threshold has been crossed,

1:41:59.353 --> 1:42:03.027
all you can do is search
for greater thresholds.

1:42:07.662 --> 1:42:09.414
Not him. I never chose him.

1:42:10.041 --> 1:42:12.587
And yet he is chosen.

1:42:13.381 --> 1:42:14.424
Marked.

1:42:15.761 --> 1:42:19.769
Gifts cannot be ungiven.

1:42:20.019 --> 1:42:23.192
Only exchanges can be made.

1:42:23.526 --> 1:42:26.156
I was told that the box is in my hands.

1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:27.618
If not me, another.

1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:29.329
Right?

1:42:29.956 --> 1:42:32.753
-Not him.
-Riley, what are you doing?

1:42:39.516 --> 1:42:43.524
Perhaps you'd prefer...

1:42:44.611 --> 1:42:46.238
Another.

1:42:55.966 --> 1:42:59.641
Anything is better than this.

1:43:01.101 --> 1:43:03.481
Perhaps we were wrong

1:43:03.564 --> 1:43:04.817
about you.

1:43:07.447 --> 1:43:10.203
You've never sought sensation.

1:43:13.835 --> 1:43:15.213
Your whole life,

1:43:15.839 --> 1:43:17.300
every conquest,

1:43:18.427 --> 1:43:20.181
all your pleasures

1:43:20.264 --> 1:43:23.062
lie in power.

1:43:27.070 --> 1:43:28.239
Power.

1:43:35.169 --> 1:43:36.338
For your efforts,

1:43:37.090 --> 1:43:40.764
we offer the Leviathan configuration.

1:43:42.142 --> 1:43:44.021
Riley, Riley. Hold on. Hold on.

1:43:46.609 --> 1:43:48.905
I tried to stop you, remember?

1:43:50.575 --> 1:43:51.619
Yeah?

1:43:53.581 --> 1:43:55.126
Just put the fucking thing down.

1:43:56.671 --> 1:43:58.215
Just put the fucking thing down.

1:43:58.299 --> 1:43:59.509
Okay?

1:44:04.311 --> 1:44:05.521
Give it to me!

it will be yours to wield.

-VOIGHT: No!
-Oh, yes.

1:46:42.628 --> 1:46:45.382
We have such sights to show you.

1:47:37.946 --> 1:47:39.032
Go.

1:47:39.825 --> 1:47:40.911
No.

1:47:41.871 --> 1:47:44.083
I'll be fine. Okay?

1:47:46.379 --> 1:47:47.381
Just finish it.

1:48:24.665 --> 1:48:25.792
MATT: Riley...

1:48:29.299 --> 1:48:31.136
Riley, look at me.

1:48:33.599 --> 1:48:34.685
Take my hand.

1:48:37.189 --> 1:48:38.610
Take me home.

1:49:00.235 --> 1:49:01.279
No.

1:49:04.828 --> 1:49:06.289
I've seen your rewards...

1:49:06.624 --> 1:49:08.377
I know my brother's gone.

1:49:09.922 --> 1:49:11.634
I don't want anything from you.

1:49:13.011 --> 1:49:17.979
-Nothing.
-Then you have chosen...

1:49:18.606 --> 1:49:20.944
A life of regret.

Knowing everything you've done,
everyone you've hurt

1:49:27.999 --> 1:49:29.043
and lost.

1:49:29.670 --> 1:49:33.176
Your suffering has barely begun.

1:49:37.602 --> 1:49:42.153
You chose to live, to carry that weight.

Bitter and brief.

the Lament Configuration.
