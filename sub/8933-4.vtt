This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:02.669
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.840
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.044
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.946
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:14.280 --> 00:16.383
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:17.350 --> 00:18.385
Yikes!

00:19.052 --> 00:20.353
Yaaaah...

00:23.289 --> 00:24.557
Yeaaaah!

00:24.557 --> 00:27.494
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.237
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.905 --> 00:40.206
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.977 --> 00:46.146
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:47.013 --> 00:48.415
the Raccoons!!

00:48.415 --> 00:50.583

01:06.266 --> 01:08.735
Wow! Here they come!

01:08.735 --> 01:11.237
Well Broo,
it's time to go fishing!

01:12.405 --> 01:15.809
Fishing!? This is the
Evergreen championships!

01:15.809 --> 01:17.944
It's front page news, Cedric!

01:17.944 --> 01:20.046
What's so
thrilling about tearing up

01:20.046 --> 01:22.849
the countryside and
making a lot of noise?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.718
Thrilling?! Thrilling?

01:25.718 --> 01:29.189
Ha! What's so thrilling about
sitting in a boat all day

01:29.189 --> 01:30.924
and whacking mosquitoes!

01:30.924 --> 01:33.960
Wendo/Toof: C'mon Bix!
C'mon Bix! That-a-boy!

01:33.960 --> 01:37.063
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon Bix!

01:37.063 --> 01:38.665
Rule five!

Learn to drive.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.171
Watch out!

01:46.606 --> 01:48.775
Toof/Wendo: Yahhoo!

01:48.775 --> 01:50.110
Woooha!

01:50.110 --> 01:52.912
Wow! Did you
see that finish?

01:52.912 --> 01:54.647
No, I didn't.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.383
Hey Bix!
You're the champ!

01:57.383 --> 01:59.452
Number
one again, Bix.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.387
Hey! Where's the crowd?

02:01.387 --> 02:04.524
The press? The adoring fans?

02:04.524 --> 02:05.925
Here we are, Bix!

02:05.925 --> 02:08.928
Excuse me?
I'm Bert Raccoon,

02:08.928 --> 02:11.030
from the Evergreen Standard.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.966
The newspaper.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.901
Ah. You're here!

02:14.901 --> 02:17.737
Hi, Bix Wheelie's the name.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.405
You're going
to interview Bix?

02:19.405 --> 02:22.075
How's this,
for the front page?

02:22.075 --> 02:23.877
Wow. Perfect!

02:23.877 --> 02:25.411
Hey Bix, are
you going to tell him

02:25.411 --> 02:27.914
about the Badger Bix Bike Club?

02:28.414 --> 02:31.117
Better yet, hop on!

02:31.117 --> 02:33.052
I'll take you for a ride.

02:34.888 --> 02:37.457
You mean it? Wow!

02:37.457 --> 02:42.128
Sure, I'm gonna tell you
all about the famous Bix Wheelie

02:42.128 --> 02:44.164
for your newspaper story.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.633
Isn't he the greatest?

02:46.633 --> 02:47.901
Uh huh.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.236
Hey, can my
friend come along?

02:50.236 --> 02:51.471
No thanks, Bert.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.573
I'm going to whack mosquitoes.

02:53.573 --> 02:55.675
Weird!

02:55.675 --> 02:58.111
Sounds thriiiillling.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.324
Bix Wheelie! Hmph!

03:15.195 --> 03:17.197
Hey, Cedric!

03:19.699 --> 03:21.434
Hiya, Cedric.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.370
Hey, that's a nice boat!

03:24.370 --> 03:27.540
Dad's going to buy
me one just like it.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.143
Ah, it's okay.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.545
That's my friend's boat.
Right, Cedric?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.380
It's Pop's boat, Bert.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.450
Oh, it's
your Pop's boat.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.052
How fast does
this thing go?!

03:39.052 --> 03:43.056
Hmmm-hm!
Hey!

03:43.056 --> 03:44.857
Hey, can
I take her for a spin?

03:44.857 --> 03:47.427
I'm sorry,
but Pop has a rule,

03:47.427 --> 03:49.662
that only I drive the boat.

03:49.662 --> 03:53.533
Oh. That's cool,
our club has rules too!

03:53.533 --> 03:55.001
Oh, really?

03:55.001 --> 03:56.736
Rule six?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.504
Wendo/Toof: Trust Bix!

03:58.504 --> 03:59.639
You see?

03:59.639 --> 04:02.342
Yeah, Cedric,
you can trust Bix!

04:02.342 --> 04:05.678
Yeah, he's the
trailbike champion!

04:05.678 --> 04:07.146
Well...

04:07.146 --> 04:08.414
Allriiiiight!

04:09.916 --> 04:10.917
Yaaaa!

04:13.853 --> 04:16.256
Hey, slow down!

04:17.257 --> 04:19.192
Bert would you tell him to...

04:20.226 --> 04:21.694
...slow down!!!

04:21.694 --> 04:23.329
Bix,

04:23.329 --> 04:25.565
it's a little shallow
around here.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.934
T-th-the-there might be rocks.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.168
Rocks?

04:29.168 --> 04:32.405
The only thing that
rocks around here.. is me!

04:32.405 --> 04:36.409
Rule nine: if it's fun,
it's fine!

04:36.409 --> 04:38.778
Whoaaaaa!

04:42.115 --> 04:45.785
Hey, that was... close.

04:46.919 --> 04:49.088
Oops! Oh ohhhhh.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.292
Pop is really
going to have a fit!

04:52.292 --> 04:55.094
I didn't see the rock.
Did you see the rock?!

04:55.094 --> 04:58.064
I'm really sorry about this.

04:58.064 --> 05:01.968
Bix, we did tell you
to slow down. I-I mean...

05:01.968 --> 05:04.070
Bert, I can't slow down...

05:04.070 --> 05:06.072
I live in the fast lane!

05:06.072 --> 05:08.074
You know what that's like?

05:08.074 --> 05:10.743
Well, I...

05:10.743 --> 05:12.779
I mean, if Cedric was
watching for rocks

05:12.779 --> 05:14.080
it wouldn't have happened.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.050
What do you mean,
'watching for rocks'!?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.451
Well...

05:18.451 --> 05:22.755
the guy in front always
watches for rocks, right Bert?

05:22.755 --> 05:25.158
W-w-well,
ah-uh-oh.. I guess.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.194
Bert!!
Don't worry Cedric,

05:28.194 --> 05:30.997
my dad owns a big
hardware store.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.165
We'll fix it.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.800
See?
There you go, Cedric.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.169
He'll fix it!
Yeah.

05:38.805 --> 05:42.108
Ooo-hmmmmm.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.978
Pig1: Oh, you're meditating
magnificently, Sir.

05:45.978 --> 05:50.783
Pig2: The Swami says, 'peace of
mind is like money in the bank'.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.518
Money in his bank!

05:52.518 --> 05:55.955
He's making a fortune off
the hat franchise alone!

05:55.955 --> 05:59.459
Pig1: And he scorns
material wealth, Sir.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.127
That's where
I've got the edge!

06:01.127 --> 06:03.863
I'll meditate
myself to millions!

06:03.863 --> 06:06.032
I'll buy a fleet of Swamis!

06:07.033 --> 06:10.002
Pig2: Now, Sir,
remember, wild rages,

06:10.002 --> 06:11.871
Pig1: And terrible tantrums...

06:11.871 --> 06:14.340
Pig2: Waste valuable energy.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.976
Pig1: And energy is power.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.978
And power is money.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.847
Pig2: And money in the bank...

06:20.847 --> 06:23.950
Pig1: ...Is peace of mind.

06:23.950 --> 06:27.720
Pig2/Cyril: Oooommmmmmm.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.429
Pig3: Boss!
Ahhhh!

06:37.497 --> 06:39.499
This better be
important, porker,

06:39.499 --> 06:42.068
or your next job will
be in a can of beans!

06:42.702 --> 06:45.004
Pig3: It's, it's Cedric, Sir.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.573
Cedric?
Pig3: He's got some...

06:47.573 --> 06:49.809
not so good news.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.845
You put a
hole in my boat?!

06:52.845 --> 06:54.614
I'm sorry, Pop.

06:54.614 --> 06:59.185
I should've done a better
job of 'watching for rocks'.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.553
Watching for rocks!?

07:00.553 --> 07:01.854
Who was driving?!

07:03.222 --> 07:07.193
You mean, you let that half-
wit Raccoon drive my boat!?

07:07.193 --> 07:10.563
No, Pop.
Bert wasn't driving it.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.565
You've let me down, son.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.535
Sorry, Pop.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.507
Hi, Cedric.
Hi, Melissa, hi, Ralph.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.910
Um, are you
looking for Bert?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.678
Oh. Is he here?

07:25.678 --> 07:28.047
He just left
in a cloud of dust

07:28.047 --> 07:30.116
with the trailbike trio.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.117
Oh.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.652
What's
the matter, Cedric?

07:32.652 --> 07:34.720
Oh, nothing...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.923
Well, I'm
worried about Bert, too.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.090
You are?

07:38.090 --> 07:39.792
Cedric, you know
how Bert likes to be

07:39.792 --> 07:41.594
accepted by everyone.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.931
Well, if he wants to be accepted
by the Badger Bix Bike Club,

07:44.931 --> 07:47.300
I-I don't know, what
he'll end up doing!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.101
Oh,
don't worry, Melissa,

07:49.101 --> 07:50.803
Bert will do the right thing.

07:51.704 --> 07:55.842
(chuckles) You mean, I can
join the Badger Bix Bike Club!?

07:55.842 --> 07:56.976
Sure!

07:56.976 --> 07:59.612
But I don't have a bike?

07:59.612 --> 08:01.080
Can you ride one?

08:01.080 --> 08:04.917
Ha! Can Bert Raccoon
ride a trailbike!?

08:04.917 --> 08:06.919
Ha-haa! I can ride
one blindfolded.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.590
Uh oh!

08:11.157 --> 08:12.658
Well, take your pick.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
You mean,
I can try one of these?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.296
Sure.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.499
This one?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.268
Ah. That's my bike, Bert.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.505
Oh. Oh yeah, uh.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.607
How about... that one?

08:27.607 --> 08:30.610
Sure. If you
want to buy it first.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.513
Ah.. that one?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.114
Allriiiight!

08:35.114 --> 08:38.251
Maybe I should
ask Toof if it's okay.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.485
Toof's busy.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.787
He won't mind. Hop on.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.792
My bike?!

08:46.792 --> 08:49.495
Let the fun begin.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.331
Ahhhhh!

08:52.331 --> 08:56.335
Stop! There's
no brakes on that bike!

08:56.335 --> 08:57.537
Aaaah!
What?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.972
And the
accelerator is jammed.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.674
Now you tell me?!

09:01.674 --> 09:04.510
Ahhhhh!!!!

09:08.548 --> 09:11.083
Aaaah!

09:13.786 --> 09:16.489
Oommmmmmmm...

09:16.489 --> 09:19.358
Pig1: Ah Sir,
you're already looking

09:19.358 --> 09:22.295
like a new Cyril Sneer.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.230
Pig3: Oh yes.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.933
It's much nicer around here.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.702
I-I-I mean ah...

09:29.702 --> 09:32.071
Stop babbling,
you nincom-pigs!

09:32.071 --> 09:34.407
I can't hear myself think!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.909
Pig2: But Sir, the Swami says,

09:36.909 --> 09:39.745
clear your mind of all thoughts.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.647
Ahhhhh!!!

09:41.647 --> 09:44.884
Pig 1: Especially
nasty thoughts, Sir.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.720
Pig3: Nasty thoughts
waste energy.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.556
Pig2: And energy is power.

09:50.556 --> 09:52.892
Pig1: And power is money.

09:52.892 --> 09:54.393
And money in the bank.

12:25.211 --> 12:28.247
I'm a member of the
Badger Bix Bike Club!

12:28.247 --> 12:30.015
Ralph/Melissa: You're what?!

12:30.015 --> 12:31.584
Now all I need
is a trailbike!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.285
I-I better start saving!

12:33.285 --> 12:35.688
I'll mow lawns, paint fences,

12:35.688 --> 12:37.923
cut hair, take in laundry!

12:37.923 --> 12:40.526
Bert, calm down!

12:40.526 --> 12:42.995
Haven't you forgotten
about Cedric?

12:42.995 --> 12:45.731
Cedric? Do you think
he'd lend me the money?

12:45.731 --> 12:47.433
No, Bert!!

12:47.433 --> 12:50.903
We think you might be forgetting
who your real friends are!

12:50.903 --> 12:53.873
Cedric doesn't want
to join the club, Melissa.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.275
He just wants to go fishing.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.277
You don't like
fishing anymore, Bert?

12:58.277 --> 13:00.446
Well, sure I do. But, um...

13:00.446 --> 13:02.281
Bix is fun, Melissa.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.016
He's cool!

13:04.016 --> 13:05.785
And he thinks that I'm cool too!

13:05.785 --> 13:07.052
And that's cool!

13:07.052 --> 13:09.121
What is this?
The Polar Bear Club?

13:09.121 --> 13:11.257
Cedric was
looking for you today?

13:11.257 --> 13:13.058
He was?
Hmm-hmm.

13:13.058 --> 13:16.128
And he looked like he'd
just lost his best friend.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.897
Gee. You're right!

13:17.897 --> 13:19.799
I have been ignoring Cedric.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.901
I'm going to find him right now!

13:21.901 --> 13:24.069
Thanks, Melissa! See ya, Ralph.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.110
C'mon Bert!
Let's go for a ride!

13:31.110 --> 13:32.812
I can't today, Bix.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.280
I gotta find Cedric.

13:41.220 --> 13:44.089
That was a great
ride, right Wendo?

13:44.790 --> 13:47.226
Ah, it was okay.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.761
But the first
thing tomorrow

13:48.761 --> 13:51.130
I've got to find
Cedric and explain.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.933
Hey, don't
worry about the boat.

13:53.933 --> 13:55.534
Bix'll fix it.

13:55.534 --> 13:57.903
Hey, Sneer's a millionaire,

13:57.903 --> 14:00.406
he can buy a new boat. Ah...

14:00.406 --> 14:02.074
He's a millionaire?!

14:02.074 --> 14:05.778
Wow! What kind of cars
he drive, Bert?

14:05.778 --> 14:09.515
Ha! You haven't
seen Cyril Sneer's limo?

14:09.515 --> 14:10.783
Whoa!

14:10.783 --> 14:14.420
It makes the Chrysler building
look like a pick-up truck!

14:14.420 --> 14:16.722
It's got triple overhead cams

14:16.722 --> 14:18.591
and chrome wheeled drive,

14:18.591 --> 14:21.460
and side pipes a mile long and...

14:21.460 --> 14:26.098
Well, my old man's
GX250 V12 ZXL

14:26.098 --> 14:28.467
has superturbo overdrive!

14:28.467 --> 14:32.438
Well, Mr. Sneer's
limo has double super turbo

14:32.438 --> 14:34.607
over overdrive!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.275
Plus, two video games,

14:36.275 --> 14:39.278
and hot and cold running water!

14:39.278 --> 14:41.313
Sounds awesome.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.982
Let's take a look.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.116
Well, ah...

14:44.116 --> 14:45.684
Shhhh! Listen.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.720
Hear that?

14:56.195 --> 14:59.531
Well? Turn on the blaster,
it's driving me nuts.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.167
Oohhmm!!

15:02.167 --> 15:06.372
Pig1: Oh Sir, you're
meditating marvellously.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.841
Pig2: Oh yes, Sir.

15:17.316 --> 15:18.984
What are you
doing in here?!

15:18.984 --> 15:20.185
Having a party!

15:20.185 --> 15:21.654
Pig1/Pig2: No, Sir!

15:21.654 --> 15:23.589
No, Sir!!

15:23.589 --> 15:26.058
So this is what
goes on when I'm meditating!

15:26.058 --> 15:27.693
No, Sir!

15:27.693 --> 15:29.628
It's out there, Sir!

15:29.628 --> 15:32.164
Well, get out
there and put a lid on it!

15:33.732 --> 15:37.036
Uh, guys, don't you
think it's a little... ah,

15:37.036 --> 15:38.370

16:28.053 --> 16:30.089
First, you sink my boat.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.958
Then that masked menace,
you call a friend,

16:32.958 --> 16:35.361
tries to run me down
on my own doorstep.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.062
B-b-but Pop...
And now?

16:37.062 --> 16:39.498
Now you're throwing
all night parties

16:39.498 --> 16:41.133
for the local
motorcycle gang!

16:41.133 --> 16:42.301
Oh, but Pop...

16:42.301 --> 16:44.636
Where did I go wrong?

16:45.170 --> 16:48.340
Son, you're grounded
for six months!

16:48.340 --> 16:51.810
And if that Raccoon is
caught on my land again,

16:51.810 --> 16:53.078
fur will fly!

16:53.078 --> 16:55.814
Grrrr!

16:59.952 --> 17:02.988
I-I don't think
we should be here.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.523
We just want
to sneak a peek

17:04.523 --> 17:06.825
at the limo and
then we'll beat it.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.161
Heeey, the door's open!

17:09.161 --> 17:11.196
Shhhhhh!
Don't go in there.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.700
What's the matter
Bert, you scared?

17:19.104 --> 17:21.640
Well, they had a look...
Now, let's go!

17:21.640 --> 17:25.044
Hey, Bert!
Rule one. Never run!

17:25.044 --> 17:26.612
Oh yeah?

17:26.612 --> 17:29.381
Relax Bert,
I'll get 'em out.

17:32.117 --> 17:33.118
Awesome!

17:34.353 --> 17:35.988
Hey, cool!

17:35.988 --> 17:38.690
Hey Bix, over here!

17:38.690 --> 17:42.027
This is a bunch of fun.

17:42.027 --> 17:45.197
Wow, and what's this?

17:47.299 --> 17:48.267
Hmmm?

17:49.334 --> 17:50.469
Aaah!

17:51.537 --> 17:52.571
Ugh!!!

17:53.472 --> 17:56.241
C'mon you guys!
Right, now!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.743
Relax, Bert.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.881
A bomb wouldn't
wake up Cyril Sneer.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.852
Yeagh!!

18:11.990 --> 18:14.359
Oh no!!
We've got to put it out!

18:14.359 --> 18:15.427
Oh no!

18:15.427 --> 18:17.930
Put it out?!
Let's get out!

18:19.098 --> 18:21.066
Where's the fire alarm?!

18:22.167 --> 18:24.837
Are you crazy?! C'mon!

18:24.837 --> 18:27.339
You mean,
you're gonna run?

18:29.074 --> 18:31.677
Every day, in every way

18:31.677 --> 18:34.213
you're getting richer
and richer...

18:34.213 --> 18:37.116
Every day, in every way,
I'm rich!!

18:37.116 --> 18:39.384
Wendo! Toof! C'mon!

18:43.689 --> 18:46.625
Bix! I'm trapped!

18:46.625 --> 18:47.960
Help!

18:47.960 --> 18:48.994
Wendo?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.130
Heeeelp!

18:53.098 --> 18:54.533
Grrr!!
Ahhh!!

18:58.804 --> 19:01.373
Bix! Help me!

19:02.941 --> 19:04.409
Bix! Do something!

19:04.409 --> 19:07.146
Wendo's trapped! Bix!

19:09.047 --> 19:11.783
My garage?!
It's on fire!

19:12.551 --> 19:15.287
I-I-I didn't do it!
Bert did it!

19:15.287 --> 19:16.455
Bert's in there?!

19:18.056 --> 19:19.158
My garage!

19:19.158 --> 19:21.260
My limo! My son!

19:22.127 --> 19:23.295
Cedric!

19:23.295 --> 19:24.930
Bert! Where are you?!

19:24.930 --> 19:29.801
Cedric! I'm okay, but
Wendo's trapped at the back!

19:29.801 --> 19:32.204
(coughing) Bix! Bix!

19:32.204 --> 19:34.439
Wendo!
Get down on the floor!

19:34.439 --> 19:36.308
Under the smoke!

19:37.309 --> 19:39.011
There's air under the smoke!

19:39.011 --> 19:42.014
Air you can breathe!

19:46.919 --> 19:48.120
Gotcha!

19:48.120 --> 19:50.689
Sir! Sir!
There's a fire!

19:56.662 --> 19:59.431
Hey, thanks, guys.

19:59.431 --> 20:04.002
It's my... buddy you
should be thanking. I just...

20:04.002 --> 20:05.837
It was
team work, Bert.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.339
Thanks Cedric.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.341
Hey, where'd you
learn that trick

20:09.341 --> 20:11.043
about going
under the smoke?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.111
From
being around Pop

20:13.111 --> 20:15.314
and his cigars!

20:15.314 --> 20:18.350
Bert/Cedric:

20:18.350 --> 20:19.384
Oh, oh.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.853
And from now on
you fur-lined fanatic.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.355
You're an endangered species!

20:25.691 --> 20:28.827
Mr. Sneer, first,
I want to apologize

20:28.827 --> 20:30.896
for damaging your boat.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.997
I was right!

20:31.997 --> 20:33.565
You did put the hole in it!

20:34.866 --> 20:36.568
Bert didn't do it.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.404
He did it!

20:39.404 --> 20:43.875
And Mr. Sneer, I'm
sorry for driving recklessly.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.177
I shouldn't have.

20:45.177 --> 20:49.214
There were no brakes on my
bike and Bix let him ride it!

20:49.214 --> 20:51.917
Yeah, but I didn't
start the fire!

20:51.917 --> 20:53.085
Grrrr!!!

20:53.085 --> 20:56.188
Okay! Okay!
I started the fire!

20:59.224 --> 21:02.194
I-I'm sorry, son.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.430
I...made a mistake.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.165
That's okay, Pop.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.067
We all make mistakes.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.874
Cedric, ya know
there's nothing better

21:15.874 --> 21:19.911
than sitting in a boat with
a fishing line and a friend.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.581
You know, Bert,
I'm glad you're here!

21:22.581 --> 21:25.350
Rule 10,
let's start again.

21:25.917 --> 21:29.554
Every day, in every way

21:29.554 --> 21:33.692
you're getting richer
and richer, Sir.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.429
Pull, you pampered porkers!

21:37.429 --> 21:41.066
Pull!! Aaaah...

21:41.066 --> 21:44.303
