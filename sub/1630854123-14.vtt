WEBVTT

00:35.836 --> 00:38.072
1,000 packs, all ones.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.307
100 Gs total, right?

00:39.307 --> 00:41.475
Yeah.

00:41.475 --> 00:45.045
Here's your $100,000 back,
all big bills.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.115
I can't believe you go
through this many dollar bills

00:47.115 --> 00:48.949
every week, it's crazy.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.685
What can I say?
Customers have to make it rain.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.487
Surprising, in this economy.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.323
Strip joints are
recession-proof.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.824
Guys will give up
their morning lattes

00:56.824 --> 00:58.726
before they give up
their lap dances.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.228
That's a fact.

01:00.228 --> 01:03.531
Keeping the economy going,
one dollar bill at a time.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.832
I'll see you next week.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.706
Come on, come on. Big money.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.848
Hey!

01:26.854 --> 01:28.389
Freeze!

01:47.141 --> 01:49.743
That sounds good. OK.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.145
Yep.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.314
Mortgage is all set, and
the broker is ready to close

01:53.314 --> 01:54.648
whenever we are.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.784
OK.
I'll talk to you later.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.652
Oh, you're really
going through with it.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.188
Yes, ma'am.
Full steam ahead.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.789
You only live once, right?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.592
Bless you
for not saying YOLO.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.927
Here, check it out.
It's sick.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.432
I mean, this is so nice.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.369
You can afford this?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.738
- What?
- I make what you make.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.408
Ah, but it is not what you
make, it is how you invest it.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.742
Oh, I didn't realize

02:21.742 --> 02:23.577
you were an investment guru
all of a sudden.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.613
I'm not a guru.
I just got into

02:25.613 --> 02:28.249
the right investments
at the right time, I guess.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.984
Oh. Good for you.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.653
Like, when did you

02:32.653 --> 02:34.588
start to care so much
about material things?

02:34.588 --> 02:37.225
I'm not materialistic.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.793
That watch?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.463
I guess I'm just done
saving for a rainy day.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.732
We work hard.
Can't take it with you.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.268
For example,
when I look at this watch--

02:47.268 --> 02:49.203
- Mm-hmm.
- It brings me joy.

02:49.203 --> 02:52.139
It's kind of like an emotional
return on my investment.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.308
Some might call it a dividend.
- Mmm.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.877
Hey. Armored car robbery.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.447
Jubal wants us all to
head down to the scene.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.824
You coming?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.593
Yes.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.529
Yeah, I get it.
I really do.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.465
But what if it doesn't
bounce back?

03:17.465 --> 03:19.667
Based off of what, a hunch?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.669
Listen, I really appreciate
your confidence, Jordan.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.138
But I was hoping for
a little bit more.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.474
Let's just sell it now,

03:26.474 --> 03:28.942
before this crypto madness
gets any crazier.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.712
What are you talking about,
it fell another 10%?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.414
OK. Hold it, then.
For now.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.815
OK. I'll call you back.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.183
Please tell me that
you are not thinking

03:36.183 --> 03:37.918
about buying crypto.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.621
No, uh, it's just
getting hammered right now.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.922
So I thought it might
be a good time to--

03:41.922 --> 03:44.157
Good time to what,
catch a falling knife?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.995
Look. Stay away, OA.
OK?

03:47.995 --> 03:50.998
You want to buy the dips,
S 500, OK?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.001
It's real companies, real
businesses, real cash flow.

03:54.001 --> 03:57.271
Hey, perp hit the first guard
in the head with a gun,

03:57.271 --> 03:58.939
grabbed the cash, and took off.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.375
Other guard was waiting
in the car, hopped out.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.243
Took some fire, but the guy
managed to get away.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.078
- Shell casings?
- Found two on the sidewalk.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.214
All right, we'll need
to take those back to 26 Fed.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.816
The security guard that
got pistol whipped,

04:08.816 --> 04:10.784
is he doing OK?
- A concussion, a few stitches.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.786
We sent him to the hospital.
- He get a look at the perp?

04:12.786 --> 04:15.523
No.
He said he got hit from behind.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.925
About 6 feet or so,
medium build.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.427
What about his skin color?

04:19.427 --> 04:20.728
Couldn't really
get a good look.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.964
Uh, he was wearing a mask,
a balaclava.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.699
Black, I think.
- Did he say anything?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.301
No, nothing.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.236
It all happened so fast.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.271
I saw him draw down on me.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.041
I heard the gunshots.
I saw the muzzle flash, even.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.977
I thought that was it,
for real.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.813
I just, uh--
my lucky day, I guess.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.552
Look like you have
a lot of cameras.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.186
Uh, seven.

04:46.186 --> 04:49.690
Yeah, we're going to need
that footage right away.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.058
All right, folks.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.794
So NYPD has handed us an
armored car robbery case.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.896
Appears to be the fifth one
in the last 24 hours,

04:55.896 --> 04:58.666
by the same guy,
who appears to be working solo.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.801
The most recent robbery,
you can see the perp here,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.970
he fires at the guard,
missing him completely.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.338
So either he's terrible
with a gun,

05:04.338 --> 05:06.173
or he wasn't actually
trying to kill him.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.076
You can see from a robbery
earlier today, the same perp.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.844
You can also see
he's desperate for cash.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
And like I always say--

05:12.012 --> 05:13.681
Desperation makes
people dangerous.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.015
Well, close.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.150
Desperation makes people
more dangerous.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.953
This guy is definitely
no pro.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.189
I mean, it looks like he didn't
even think about the driver,

05:22.189 --> 05:24.091
or taking the first
security guard's pistol.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.326
Yeah, well, that matches with
the original theory

05:26.326 --> 05:27.561
that this is about desperation.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.862
Maybe the guy isn't
a real criminal.

05:28.862 --> 05:29.997
Just needs cash, fast.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.765
Or he's a drug addict.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.300
Did we ever see
where the perp went?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.068
Yeah. just found
this video footage,

05:35.068 --> 05:37.371
six blocks away from
the most recent crime scene.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.906
OK.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.574
Lookie, lookie.
We got a getaway car.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.342
Can we tighten up that shot,
see if we can get a plate?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.811
Copy that.

05:43.811 --> 05:46.279
Yeah.
Running those tags right now.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.115
- Thank you.
- Yep.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.651
The car was reported stolen
this morning, 7:26 AM.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.219
All right, that's
a pretty new-looking car.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.087
Let's see if we can access
the car's GPS.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.389
On it.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.393
GPS shows the car is at
Humboldt and 61st.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.964
OK.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.367
The car should be somewhere
on this block.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.770
Hey, I think that's it.

06:24.485 --> 06:28.121
FBI! Don't move.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.289
Go.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.824
We have an armed robbery
in progress.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.594
Suspect is running north
on foot on Diamond Street.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.670
Hey, hey.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.939
Jesus!

06:51.912 --> 06:53.781
Whoa, whoa.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.706
Tiff.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.046
FBI.
- What the hell?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.581
I work here.
I'm the security guard.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.749
We're looking for someone.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.351
Did you see anybody
run through here?

07:31.351 --> 07:34.622
I haven't seen anyone here
in the last seven months.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.889
It's clear.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.493
There he is.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.570
I don't see him.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.238
We lost eyes on our suspect.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.808
He was last seen on the corner
of Larson and 87th.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.192
We got some money back here.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.460
This bag actually looks like

08:13.460 --> 08:15.428
the same deposit bag
from the strip club.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.564
All right.
You guys start with the Audi.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.931
Dust for prints, DNA.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.667
Make sure you bag up
all this cash in here.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.869
- Excuse me.
- Anything?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.704
No.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.175
Hey, Jubal.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.110
<i>Still nothing on the ground.</i>
- Yeah, same with us.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.746
We're up on all the traffic
cams in the vicinity, but--

08:32.746 --> 08:34.915
- It's like he disappeared.
- For now, but we'll find him.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.216
What do we know about
the actual robbery

08:36.216 --> 08:37.551
at the check cashing store?

08:37.551 --> 08:39.052
Yeah, OA and Scola
are speaking to witnesses

08:39.052 --> 08:41.722
at the scene.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.523
He grabbed Peter, the guard,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.693
put a gun to his head,
asked for money.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.762
So I emptied my safe
into a shopping bag.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.899
$26,000.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.735
OK.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.503
Any idea what
his skin color was?

08:56.503 --> 08:59.506
No, but he sounded white.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.408
- Sounded?
- Please.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.010
I know what white people
sound like.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.444
He was white, OK?

09:04.444 --> 09:06.213
Cancel me if you want,
but he's white.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.848
Probably from Brooklyn.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.650
We got it.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.585
Here's the video.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.940
The bag you put the money in,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.407
it said "I Love New York"
on it?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.543
Yeah.
It was next to my chair.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.478
I went shopping this morning.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.649
Thanks for your help.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.117
What--
hey, what about my money?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.585
We'll do what we can.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.554
You'll do what you can?

09:47.554 --> 09:50.057
What does that mean, huh?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.759
Seriously?

09:51.759 --> 09:54.628
What's all this
"same day loan" stuff about?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.697
Means what it says.
Same day loans.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.732
Not everything is a trick,
my friend.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.802
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.237
What're you really asking, huh?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.940
You need money?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.642
I might.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.912
Something short term.
36, maybe 60 days.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.117
So he comes out of the
side door of the factory,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.585
comes this way.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.988
Unfortunately,
there's not a lot of cameras.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.490
Tiff.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.458
Balaclava.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.327
And I've got a black jacket.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.929
So he did run past here.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.700
So why can't the JOC find him
on the street cams?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.869
Because he took the subway.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.676
All right.
Any luck?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.344
No angle of the dumpster,

10:44.344 --> 10:45.746
no angle
of the subway entrance.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.014
What about in
the subway station?

10:47.014 --> 10:48.716
Yep.
I got a shot of a man,

10:48.716 --> 10:50.283
no jacket,
holding a plastic bag.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.886
OK, so the check cashing
manager said he put it in a bag

10:52.886 --> 10:55.155
that says "I Love New York."

10:55.155 --> 10:56.757
Zoom in on the bag.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.058
Yeah.
There it is.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.993
Can you push in on the suspect?
- Yep.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.062
Well, that's the same bag,
but a different guy.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.398
Got a hit.
Name is Michael Holt, age 35.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.034
Pretty impressive jacket, too.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.203
Aggravated assault, robbery,
and several drug offenses.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.839
Yeah, but the bag is
too distinctive

11:11.839 --> 11:13.173
for it to be a coincidence.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.042
Must be an accomplice.
Robber handed it off.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.476
This new player
have an address?

11:16.476 --> 11:17.845
Nothing recent.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.081
Do see a 2006 Toyota
registered in his name.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.582
Better than nothing.

11:22.582 --> 11:23.884
And he was issued a free
cell phone three weeks ago,

11:23.884 --> 11:25.252
under the Affordable
Connectivity Program.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.619
There you go.
Ping it.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.925
Cell signal is still live.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.428
Shows it's within 500 yards.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.797
Hold on.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.132
I think I see his car.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.839
It's Holt.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.710
OK.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.279
Tiff and I are going
to follow them in.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.381
You guys secure the front.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.406
FBI!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.174
Show us your hands. Now.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.945
Hey!

12:26.446 --> 12:28.548
Put the gun down, now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.017
Hey, hey, hey.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.484
Y'all put your guns down,
or I'll shoot him in the head.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.685
Don't be stupid.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.521
Put down your weapon, now.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.589
Think I'm kidding?
I'll shoot him.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.591
And then what?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.193
You got no leverage.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.528
We're here to arrest him.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.963
All you'll be doing
is saving us paperwork.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.732
Either way, you wind up dead,
you understand me?

12:52.005 --> 12:54.374
OK. OK.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.243
Don't shoot, please.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.114
Hands!
Hands in the air, now.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.116
- On the wall.
- Turn around.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.151
Now.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.189
- What the hell's going on?
- We're arresting you.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.291
That's what the hell
is going on.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.432
Karim, it's Omar.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.734
Yes, I got your email, but, um,

13:21.734 --> 13:25.205
your terms seem
a little ridiculous.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.307
What are you talking about?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.775
What do you mean, risk?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.911
My credit is nearly perfect.
You said it yourself.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.645
My mortgage is at 7%.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.582
Where do you get off
charging 18%, hmm?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.785
Let me call you back. OK.

13:39.953 --> 13:44.057
Uh, Isobel wants us
to talk to Holt.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.059
Love it.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.727
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.362
You sure?
You need to talk?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.664
Oh, no.
That was nothing, I promise.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.401
All right, well,
let's break this idiot down,

13:54.401 --> 13:56.970
get a confession.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.872
Wake up.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.341
So among other things,
we have you on armed robbery

14:01.341 --> 14:02.642
of this check cashing place.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.511
Yo, whoa!
You're wrong, man.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.379
Yo, I didn't rob anyone,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.315
especially no damn
check cashing place, man.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.816
I'm not stupid.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.384
We just caught you
buying a pound of cocaine

14:11.384 --> 14:14.254
with $26,000 in stolen cash.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.622
And you had your phone on you.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.992
That means we can
track you, see?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.693
Seems pretty stupid to me.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.529
All right, maybe so.
But listen, I didn't--

14:22.529 --> 14:23.830
I didn't rob anyone.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.598
Michael, we found
the bag that the owner

14:25.598 --> 14:28.035
put the cash in
in the back seat of your car.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.402
It wasn't mine.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.504
I snatched it from
a sketchy-looking dude.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.639
What are you talking about?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.041
Yeah.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.643
The--the way he was
looking around all nervous,

14:36.643 --> 14:39.646
clutching the bag, I figured
he had something good in it.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.249
So when he was distracted,
I pushed him down the stairs,

14:42.249 --> 14:44.484
and I grabbed the bag.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.053
And yo, when I looked inside
and I saw the cash,

14:46.053 --> 14:48.221
I mean, yo, that was like
a dream come true, man.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.223
That's your defense?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.659
You took it off
of some random guy?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.794
Yo, it's the truth, man.
I swear.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.065
I--I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.399
OK.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.834
Let's play this out
for a second.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.105
What did this sketchy guy
look like, hmm?

15:05.105 --> 15:09.076
It was a white dude,
maybe 40, not big, not small.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.343
That narrows it down

15:10.343 --> 15:12.612
to about a quarter
of the city's population.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.381
You're going to need to be
a little more specific here.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
Look, what can I say?

15:15.648 --> 15:16.849
I'm not good at
remembering stuff, man.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.651
Michael.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.919
If you don't want to be charged
with armed robbery,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.188
you're going to have
to give us something

15:21.188 --> 15:22.522
a little better than that.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.856
'Cause right now,
it is kind of hard to believe

15:23.856 --> 15:25.758
anything you're saying.
- Bro, I'm serious, man.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.129
I'm not great at
remembering faces.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.067
Yo, how about this?

15:34.067 --> 15:38.905
Um, the--the guy had
really expensive shoes on.

15:38.905 --> 15:41.208
Like--like, really
expensive-looking shoes.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.943
That--that much
I can remember.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.615
Hey.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.183
Unfortunately for us,
Michael was telling the truth.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.518
Ian?
- Yeah.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.654
I found this scrubbing
the station footage.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.697
So Michael is a crook, but
not the one we're looking for.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.400
Yeah, we got video footage
of the Jackson Avenue platform

16:07.400 --> 16:09.302
where Michael said
he grabbed the bag.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.870
OK, OK.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.809
All right, he looks upset,
like he's looking for someone.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.911
Assuming it's Michael,
since he just took his money.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.756
Can we run facial rec?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.525
Negative.
Poor image quality, bad angle.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.461
Hold up.
Rewind it.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.529
Zoom in on the shoes.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.467
I recognize that brand.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.403
Those are $1,400 a pop.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.638
- For those?
- Yeah.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.540
- How do you even know that?
- I like shoes.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.776
I was thinking about
maybe getting some.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.145
But obviously, uh, I didn't.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.946
The fact that you
even thought about that

16:53.946 --> 16:55.982
is scaring me.
- Hey, fellas.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.817
Sorry to interrupt,
but we got street-level footage

16:57.817 --> 17:00.720
above
the Jackson Avenue station.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.592
Looks like he's searching
for Michael.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.160
He gets into a cab.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.797
- Can we see his plate?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.065
All right,
call the cab company,

17:12.065 --> 17:14.934
see where they dropped
this guy off at.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.707
Cab driver said that
he went straight inside

17:20.707 --> 17:22.909
after he got dropped off.
- It's been a few hours.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.044
You think he's still here?
- He just lost a bag of cash.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.979
I mean, he could be robbing
this place, for all we know.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.915
OK, we'll take the front,
you guys take the back,

17:28.915 --> 17:31.518
you guys be our eyes out here.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.800
I'm Agent Zidan.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.369
This is Agent Scola,
with the FBI.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.338
Have you seen this guy
around here?

17:51.338 --> 17:54.073
Yeah, that's the owner. Tom.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.508
Tom Hoffman.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.809
Is he here?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.779
Yeah.
He's over there by the bar.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.385
Suspect is in the building.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.857
Excuse me, guys.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.592
Excuse me.
- Oh!

18:12.592 --> 18:14.161
Hey, hey,
watch where you're going.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.962
Hey--hey, man,
who do you think you are?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.465
Do yourself a favor.
Take a seat.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.601
He's on the move.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.875
He's got to be in
one of these rooms.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.546
Get out!

18:33.546 --> 18:34.881
Let's go.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.622
- Ah.
- Oh!

18:42.622 --> 18:43.790
- Get out of the way!
- Hey!

18:43.790 --> 18:44.591
You're not supposed
to be in here!

18:44.591 --> 18:46.293
Move!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.994
- Whoa.
- Hey!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.432
He's headed out back.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.201
Whoa.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.269
Drop your gun.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.037
Slowly.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.940
Thomas Hoffman...

19:00.940 --> 19:04.311
You are under arrest
for armed robbery,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.346
attempted murder...

19:06.346 --> 19:10.883
And for spending $1,400
on those stupid shoes.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.226
I'm not a bad guy.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.561
Well, you robbed people,

19:21.561 --> 19:24.964
shot at them,
pistol whipped them--

19:24.964 --> 19:27.234
very definition of a bad guy.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.670
I wasn't trying
to kill anyone.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.372
Oh, God.
Trust me, I was just--

19:32.372 --> 19:34.241
I was just trying
to scare them, you know?

19:34.241 --> 19:38.345
Keep them from trying
to do something heroic.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.180
We all do dumb stuff
when we're scared, right?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.549
I mean,

19:42.549 --> 19:45.352
the truth is,
I-I didn't have a choice.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.454
I mean, he said he
was going to kill me

19:47.454 --> 19:51.291
if I didn't get him his money.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.594
Who are we talking about?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.796
Mason Simonian.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.599
I owe him 300 grand.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.234
He said if I didn't
pay by tomorrow,

20:01.234 --> 20:04.704
he'd kill my parents,
and then me.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.906
Well, then, you should
have gone to the cops.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.241
Told them what was going on.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.209
But you didn't,
because you're lying.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.111
I'm not.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.446
You hear about
that family of four

20:13.446 --> 20:15.482
that was found
shot to death last week?

20:15.482 --> 20:17.083
Yeah, it happened in Queens.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.286
That was Mason.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.288
Father owed him $100K.

20:21.288 --> 20:24.223
Dude wiped out
his whole family.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.925
He bragged about it.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.660
He said he was going
to do the same to me.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.429
OK.

20:29.429 --> 20:33.300
Look, why do you owe this
Mason guy so much money?

20:33.300 --> 20:36.068
Stupidity.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.506
Lots of bad luck, too.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.208
You got to understand,
I grew up dirt poor.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.810
I saved.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.046
I--I worked a nine to five
for 10 years,

20:47.046 --> 20:49.649
until I was able
to open that club.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.084
And then
I finally started living--

20:52.084 --> 20:55.355
like, really living.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.290
And when I'd need cash,
I'd go to him.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.692
It was dumb, I know.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.294
But the banks,
they wouldn't touch me.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.229
I-I got bad credit.

21:03.229 --> 21:07.534
But Mason,
he gave me what I needed.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.603
Yeah, it was like
a disease, man!

21:10.603 --> 21:14.474
I wanted everything--
cars, women, boats.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.075
And I was making
good money, too.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.844
Like, for real.

21:17.844 --> 21:21.080
My investments were
going through the roof, but--

21:21.080 --> 21:22.882
But what?

21:24.150 --> 21:26.386
Market went south,

21:26.386 --> 21:29.356
especially my crypto stuff.

21:29.356 --> 21:32.124
Markets will do that sometimes.

21:32.124 --> 21:36.095
It--it dropped so fast.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.665
Well, look, maybe your lawyer
can figure out a way

21:38.665 --> 21:42.435
to spin all this idiocy into
some sort of insanity deal.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.014
So you think this
loan shark is real?

21:55.014 --> 21:57.350
Yeah, I mean, Hoffman just
got arrested for about

21:57.350 --> 21:59.218
six felonies, and all
he seems concerned about

21:59.218 --> 22:02.188
is this Simonian character.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.790
Hey, Tricia.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.893
Does Organized Crime have
anything on Mason Simonian?

22:10.096 --> 22:12.131
He appears to be
a high-level target.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.066
Lots of open investigations.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.568
Case agent who's been tracking
him is here in the building.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.036
You want to talk to her?
- Yeah.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.838
Yeah, tell her it might be
beneficial for both of us.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.744
Mason Simonian
is a dangerous man.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.779
Do you think he's
capable of murder?

22:26.779 --> 22:29.382
He might be good for the
killing of a family in Queens?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.350
100%.
Take a look.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.456
What kind of animal
would do something like that?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.090
We think he's good for
five or six other

22:38.090 --> 22:39.426
unsolved murders, too.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.461
But so far, he's managed
to stay out of reach.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.995
We looked at
this guy's record.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.931
He's got plenty of priors--
drug sales, sex trafficking.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.733
How hard can it be
to make a case on him?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.436
He's smart.
Got himself a jailhouse PhD.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.270
Truth is, he's hard
to get close to.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.672
Well, until now.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.074
I think we may have found
a way to nail this guy.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.544
Are you crazy?

22:57.544 --> 23:00.847
I'm not helping you
set up Simonian.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.950
If I flip on him,
then I'm a dead man,

23:03.950 --> 23:05.718
and so is my family.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.921
Then you'll sit in an 8-by-10
cell for the next 20 years.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.760
He looks scared.
He might not bite.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.996
If he's telling the truth
about Simonian, he'll roll.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.365
<i>How explicit are
Simonian's threats?</i>

23:19.365 --> 23:21.100
<i>What exactly does he say?</i>

23:21.100 --> 23:24.471
He exactly said that he's
going to shoot my parents

23:24.471 --> 23:27.640
and then put a bullet
in my head,

23:27.640 --> 23:31.043
just like he massacred
that other family.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.446
Then the only way that we are
going to be able to get this guy

23:33.446 --> 23:36.082
is if you wear a wire.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.821
How much time are you
going to shave off, huh?

23:41.821 --> 23:44.824
Can't give you a number,
all right?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.460
But we will put in a good word
with the US attorney,

23:47.460 --> 23:48.861
let them know
that you helped us out,

23:48.861 --> 23:50.497
tell them what kind of stress
you've been under.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.777
OK.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.045
I'm in.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.367
Hey guys,
Mason's just pulled up.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.937
He's headed inside
with another guy.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.414
I have eyes on them now.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.483
They're headed towards
Hoffman's table.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.761
Mason.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.295
Appreciate you
meeting me like this.

24:56.295 --> 24:59.365
Sit down.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.867
Where's my money?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.702
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.504
I'll have it,
just not by tonight.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.308
That's bad news.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.243
He hates bad news.

25:15.481 --> 25:18.751
Here's, uh, 40 grand.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.486
And I'm good for the rest,
I swear.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.188
I just need another day or two.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.723
Two days?

25:23.723 --> 25:26.258
I thought I told you
what'll happen if you're late.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.827
I know.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.462
You think I want to get iced
like that family in Queens?

25:35.602 --> 25:38.004
What'd you say to me?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.673
I'm--I'm just saying,
I don't want any problems.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.541
Hey, Tiff.
He's not taking the bait.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.344
<i>I think Hoffman's
getting nervous.</i>

25:45.344 --> 25:47.279
Let me get him
back on track.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.417
Hey, fellas.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.385
Can I get you
something to drink?

25:53.385 --> 25:54.987
Nah, we're good.
Thank you.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.589
We're just doing some
business here, sweetie.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.024
Yeah?
How's that going?

26:01.360 --> 26:04.130
Who the hell is this bitch?

26:04.130 --> 26:06.098
One, I'm not a bitch.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.900
Two, I'm his girl.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.202
So I know all about
your business.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.609
You've been running your mouth
about our thing, huh?

26:16.609 --> 26:17.944
Yeah, just to her.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.779
Because I'm the solution.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.213
And how's that, sweetie?

26:21.213 --> 26:23.215
My father, he's rich.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.684
I can get you
the rest of the money,

26:24.684 --> 26:26.318
but it's going to take
a couple of days.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.821
And what if I don't want it
in a couple of days?

26:28.821 --> 26:30.823
What if I want it now?
Can you get it?

26:30.823 --> 26:32.324
You've got to keep pushing, Tiff.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.592
We need an overt threat.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.861
No, why should I?

26:34.861 --> 26:37.930
Because I'm losing
my patience, that's why!

26:37.930 --> 26:40.432
Do you want that to happen?

26:40.432 --> 26:43.602
You kill him,
you get nothing.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.573
Excuse me?

26:47.573 --> 26:49.976
Who said anything
about killing people?

26:49.976 --> 26:53.846
Her old man has it, Mason,
and more, in the house safe.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.916
All she needs is time to get it
when he ain't home.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.458
Money is due tomorrow.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.428
You two do what you need
to get it.

27:09.428 --> 27:13.766
If not, there's penalties.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.803
It's too vague.
He's giving us nothing.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.138
Right.
All right, Tiff.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.607
He's going to have to take the
bait money, at the very least.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.910
Otherwise, we have no case.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.113
Just take the $40,000.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.380
We'll get you the rest tomorrow.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.649
Yeah, she's good for it--

27:32.985 --> 27:36.723
All or nothing,
by midnight tomorrow.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.960
Let's go.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.571
So our friends in
Organized Crime were right.

27:52.571 --> 27:53.740
Mason's smart.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.907
Today, maybe.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.743
We'll take another run
at him tomorrow.

27:56.743 --> 27:57.910
Hopefully, he'll be
a little more agitated

27:57.910 --> 28:00.046
after the deadline passes.
- Yeah.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.881
Maggie,
transport Hoffman back here.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.449
We're going to try again tomorrow.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.084
<i>Copy that.</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:13.092
Suspects are away.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.261
Simonian did
a pretty good job.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.395
Let's be real.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.430
I mean, Hoffman's an idiot.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.034
Came on way too hard,
made the guy nervous.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.374
You don't really
like this guy, do you?

28:28.374 --> 28:29.942
Hoffman?
Please.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.078
He's like the worst
kind of guy there is.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.245
He spends more than he makes,

28:33.245 --> 28:35.748
wants everybody to think
he's a big shot.

28:35.748 --> 28:40.386
Guys like that, all that
insecurity and bravado--

28:40.386 --> 28:43.823
they get what's coming to them,
trust me.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.792
I'll take that as a yes.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.894
Sorry.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.529
I guess I'm just
sensitive about all that

28:50.529 --> 28:53.599
high roller crap, you know?

28:53.599 --> 28:56.769
Why is that?

28:58.938 --> 29:02.308
My dad lived like that.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.810
Worked in real estate.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.611
And everything he had,
leveraged to the hilt.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.147
Every deal,
all or nothing, you know?

29:08.147 --> 29:11.317
I mean, we did--
we lived well,

29:11.317 --> 29:13.519
Park Avenue,
house on the Connecticut shore.

29:13.519 --> 29:17.824
But it was all an illusion.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.428
He had almost nothing
when he died, you know?

29:22.428 --> 29:25.564
Wouldn't know from
the outside world.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.800
Didn't have any equity.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.636
So I guess that's why
I'm so careful.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.572
Oh.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.141
Nina's calling me.
I'ma jump out and get this.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.442
You got it?
- Yeah.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.554
Karim?

29:48.554 --> 29:49.989
It's Omar.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.024
Yes, it is about the loan.

29:52.024 --> 29:55.327
But listen, it's not
going to work out, OK?

29:55.327 --> 29:59.065
The interest rates
are too high.

30:10.776 --> 30:13.612
I'm sorry, 14%?

30:13.612 --> 30:15.882
OK, um, now you're talking.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.050
What about closing costs?
You handle those, too?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.886
Hey, hey!

30:19.886 --> 30:21.387
They grabbed Tiff!
- What?

30:21.387 --> 30:23.455
Simonian and his guy,
they grabbed Tiff and the bag.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.690
Go, go!
- I'm going.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.063
Maggie, we have a situation.

30:31.063 --> 30:32.865
Simonian took Tiff
and the cash.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.204
This is Scola.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.505
We are in need of
immediate air support.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.473
We are in pursuit of
a gray BMW, no plates,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.242
headed west on 132nd Street.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.420
Damn it!

30:54.420 --> 30:55.854
Hey, FBI.
Move the truck!

30:55.854 --> 30:57.189
- Move it!
- Federal agent.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.091
Move the truck, now!
- Move!

30:59.091 --> 31:00.592
Now!

31:00.592 --> 31:02.895
All right, all right,
all right, I got it! Hold on.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.964
Easy, easy. Okay.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.140
Come on, come on.
Where are you?

31:16.108 --> 31:19.845
Scola, I don't see him.
I don't see him.

31:19.845 --> 31:23.015
Jubal, we lost them.

31:34.860 --> 31:35.962
Let's go, folks.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.196
Find that BMW.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.965
Ian, I want a BOLO out
on Simonian's car.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.232
I want every local agency looking.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.733
On it.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.970
Hey, we managed to
reactivate Tiff's button cam.

31:46.372 --> 31:49.108
Angle's bad.
She might be unconscious.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.058
Hey.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.128
How you like being involved
in my business now?

32:19.705 --> 32:22.008
It's him. Mason.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.512
Hello?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.080
Yeah, I got your girlfriend.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.150
You want her back in one piece,
you talk to her old man.

32:31.150 --> 32:34.020
Get my money.

32:34.020 --> 32:37.523
OK. OK.
Just don't hurt her, please.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.192
I'll get it.
Where can we meet?

32:40.192 --> 32:41.760
I'll call you in an hour.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.197
Get the money first,
then we'll meet.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.311
Hey.
Maggie arrived with Hoffman.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.846
Where are we at?

33:00.846 --> 33:02.514
Yeah, we tried pinging the
phone Simonian called from.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.850
But it's turned off.
OK. Here we go.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.250
Wait, what happened?

33:38.250 --> 33:39.851
The power on the button cam
must have run out.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.720
Yeah, there's nothing
I can do on this side.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.522
OK, let's play
with the footage,

33:43.522 --> 33:44.790
see if there's something
we can use,

33:44.790 --> 33:46.325
an address, a street sign.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.095
There's no street signs
that I can see, but--

33:49.095 --> 33:51.530
That's Simonian's house.
It's on Stillwell, 1,700 block.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.931
All right.
That's in Brooklyn.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.200
Get everyone and everything
we have there, now.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.501
Yeah.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.142
No safe way to make a dynamic
entry in a place like this.

34:03.142 --> 34:06.078
Might be best to contain first,
then make contact.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.546
Try to negotiate
a safe resolution.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.481
No, these guys are not going
to talk or surrender.

34:09.481 --> 34:10.749
We have to move now.
- No, he's right.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.218
Our best bet is
just to overwhelm them

34:12.218 --> 34:13.985
with speed and power.
- I think the risk is--

34:13.985 --> 34:17.055
This is not up for debate.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.291
Just giving my opinion.
The call's yours.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.093
Yeah, and we just made it.
So we're doing this.

34:26.332 --> 34:29.668
- You good?
- What are you talking about?

34:29.668 --> 34:32.704
I'm saying, if you want
to sit this one out--

34:32.704 --> 34:36.007
No, Scola.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.343
I'm good.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.643
Drop the gun!

35:13.679 --> 35:16.014
Keep clearing. On me.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.150
Come on in!

35:25.624 --> 35:27.659
It's Simonian.
He's down.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.834
Tiff!
Scola, in here.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.836
We got you.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.070
Hey, we got you.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.173
We got you,
we got you, we got you.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.444
- Let's get her on the chair.
- Easy.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.846
Nice and easy.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.018
Are you OK?

35:53.018 --> 35:54.453
- Yeah, I'm just dizzy.
- Oh, OK. All right.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.121
Let me take a look.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.558
All right. OK.

35:59.558 --> 36:00.626
You're gonna need
a few stitches,

36:00.626 --> 36:02.127
but you should be fine.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.495
Tiff, I should've been there.
I'm so sorry.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.364
No. Stop, OK?

36:05.364 --> 36:08.367
It happened so fast.
It's not your fault.

36:12.204 --> 36:15.073
Thank God you're OK.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.214
We got her.

36:33.459 --> 36:35.494
So...

36:35.494 --> 36:37.396
Simonian is dead?

36:40.165 --> 36:41.600
Yeah.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.502
And are my parents OK?

36:43.502 --> 36:45.003
They're fine.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.309
What now?

36:50.309 --> 36:52.644
Well, you kept your end
of the bargain,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.112
so we'll keep ours.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.448
So you're going
to fight for me?

36:56.448 --> 36:59.084
Ask the prosecutors
to give me a good deal?

36:59.084 --> 37:01.720
I'm going to do everything
that I can, OK?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.755
But you will have
to do some time.

37:03.755 --> 37:07.426
There just isn't
a way around that.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.702
I'm such an idiot, man.

37:16.702 --> 37:20.005
I threw my life away over what?

37:22.441 --> 37:25.544
Yeah.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.813
I'm sorry, man.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.731
Are you good?

37:45.731 --> 37:47.132
Yeah.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.000
I'm just going to
finish up this report.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.569
No problem.
- OK.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.838
'Cause Maggie just told me
that you were trying to close

37:52.838 --> 37:55.541
on a new condo?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.446
OA, is that why
you were shutting me out?

38:00.446 --> 38:01.713
Because I was being harsh
about the--

38:01.713 --> 38:02.948
No, no, no, no.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.182
You were just being honest,

38:04.182 --> 38:08.520
and there's nothing wrong
with that.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.821
'Cause I'm happy to help.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.823
If you need extra cash
to close the deal--

38:11.823 --> 38:14.960
Nope.
I, uh--I killed it.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.564
I'm not going to buy it.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.700
The carrying costs
would have buried me, so--

38:21.700 --> 38:23.569
I don't really want to live
paycheck to paycheck.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.970
OK, but if you kill the deal,

38:24.970 --> 38:28.874
won't you lose
the good faith deposit?

38:28.874 --> 38:30.275
It's not ideal.

38:30.275 --> 38:33.412
Um, but it's better than
the alternative.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.683
You sure?

38:37.683 --> 38:41.219
New condo, New York City--
it's a good investment.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.855
Definitely better than
all that crypto nonsense.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.657
I appreciate the offer, Scola.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.527
But I'm good.

38:48.527 --> 38:51.663
OK.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.432
Uh, look.

38:57.569 --> 39:01.006
I don't know how to say this.

39:01.006 --> 39:05.243
I consider us
to be good friends.

39:05.243 --> 39:07.278
So...

39:07.278 --> 39:11.082
the next time
you're in a jam,

39:11.082 --> 39:14.219
just come talk to me.

39:14.219 --> 39:17.523
OK?

39:17.523 --> 39:20.291
All right?

39:20.291 --> 39:21.960
Thank you.
