I LET YOU STAY YESTERDAY.

00:06.567 --> 00:09.133
THE BUS IS GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

00:09.133 --> 00:12.433
YOU CAN'T MISS SCHOOL
AGAIN, MICHAEL.

00:12.433 --> 00:13.933
MICHAEL, COME--
GET UP.

00:13.933 --> 00:15.133
I AM SICK OF THIS.
COME ON, GET UP.

00:15.133 --> 00:16.800
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800

00:21.433 --> 00:23.467

MICHAEL'S NOT GETTING UP.

00:23.467 --> 00:24.900

ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.433
MICHAEL?

00:26.433 --> 00:29.700
[deep voice] MICHAEL,
THIS IS YOUR FATHER SPEAKING.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.533
GET UP.

00:31.533 --> 00:33.100
WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:33.100 --> 00:36.033
EASY, EASY.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.200
MICHAEL--ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, MICHAEL.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.100
GET UP, WILL YA?

00:40.100 --> 00:41.533
COME ON.

00:41.533 --> 00:42.767
- I'M SICK.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.733
- WHAT--

00:47.567 --> 00:49.067
- HE'S NOT SICK.
- LET'S GO.

00:49.067 --> 00:50.100
COME ON, YOU'RE NOT SICK.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.300
DON'T TRY TO FOOL AROUND.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.567
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

00:52.567 --> 00:54.533
- IT'S MY STOMACH.
- YOUR STOMACH?

00:54.533 --> 00:56.167
WELL, WHERE DOES IT HURT?
POINT.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.867
SHOW ME WHERE.

00:57.867 --> 00:59.367
- IT'S MY HEAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:59.367 --> 01:01.500
- LET'S GO.
COME ON, IT'S TIME FOR SCHOOL.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.433
- I'M SICK!
- YESTERDAY HE SAID HE WAS SICK,

01:03.433 --> 01:04.733
AND LAST NIGHT,
HE'S RUNNING AROUND

01:04.733 --> 01:06.267
WITH A CAPE ON GOING,
"WHOO-WHOO!"

01:06.267 --> 01:07.633
- YEAH, OKAY, YESTERDAY
YOU SAID YOU WERE SICK,

01:07.633 --> 01:09.133
AND LAST NIGHT,
YOU RUN AROUND WITH A CAPE ON

01:09.133 --> 01:11.467
GOING, "WHOO-WHOO."

01:11.467 --> 01:13.100
- HE'S NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT AGAIN.

01:13.100 --> 01:14.467
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY
WITH THAT AGAIN.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.733
- JUST--DON'T JUST REPEAT
WHAT I SAY!

01:15.733 --> 01:17.467
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

01:17.467 --> 01:20.067
NO, DON'T GO BACK--
MICH--DID YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK?

01:20.067 --> 01:21.300
DID HE DO
HIS HOMEWORK?

01:21.300 --> 01:22.600
- HE SAID
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.333
- AND YOU FELL FOR THAT?

01:24.333 --> 01:26.800
OH, BOY, I AM GONNA LIE
TO YOU MORE.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.167
MIKE--MICHAEL,
DID YOU HAVE HOMEWORK DUE?

01:30.167 --> 01:31.433
- LEAVE ME ALONE!

01:31.433 --> 01:33.000
- YOU SEE?
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.333
I KNOW THIS GAME.
I INVENTED IT.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.667
- THE BUS IS COMING!

01:36.667 --> 01:38.633
- ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL,
THE BUS IS COMING.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.867
I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND.
NOW, YOU GOT TO GET UP, COME ON.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.400
- NO!
- MICHAEL, LISTEN.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.300
IF--IF YOU MISS THAT BUS,

01:44.300 --> 01:45.800
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL,

01:45.800 --> 01:47.767
AND I'M GONNA BE LATE.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.467
- I DON'T CARE!

01:49.467 --> 01:51.533
- YOU DON'T CARE, HUH?
YOU DON'T CARE? YOU DON'T CARE?

01:51.533 --> 01:52.933
HOW ABOUT I PICK YOU UP
AND I CARRY YOU

01:52.933 --> 01:54.200
TO THE BUS
IN YOUR PAJAMAS, HUH?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.033
MAYBE YOU CARE ABOUT THAT!
- GO AWAY!

01:56.033 --> 01:57.333
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.800
- OH, RAY, NO,
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.100
- LOOK, YOU GOT ME INTO THIS,

02:00.100 --> 02:01.267
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA
DO IT MY WAY.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.067
- THE BUS IS HERE!

02:03.067 --> 02:05.400
- YOU HOLD THAT BUS!

02:05.400 --> 02:06.967
LOOK, ALL RIGHT, HELP ME.
HELP ME.

02:06.967 --> 02:08.600
- RAY!

02:08.600 --> 02:09.733
- BITE HIS HANDS.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.167
- JUST--JUST LET HIM GO.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.967
- YOU ASKED FOR MY HELP.

02:12.967 --> 02:17.033
WELL, THIS IS HOW I DO IT.

02:17.033 --> 02:20.167
- THE BUS IS GONE!

02:25.667 --> 02:27.167
- IF HE WAS WEARING
FEET PAJAMAS,

02:27.167 --> 02:30.300
HE'D STILL BE IN HERE.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.167
- HEY.
- HELLO.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.600
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.833
- WELL, AMY'S
WORKING LATE TONIGHT.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.533
- SO?

02:42.533 --> 02:45.967
- SO I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SAY "HEY" TO MY LITTLE BRO.

02:45.967 --> 02:47.167
WHAT?
A GUY CAN'T STOP BY

02:47.167 --> 02:49.400
AND SAY "HEY"
TO HIS LITTLE BRO?

02:49.400 --> 02:53.267
- THERE'S LEFTOVER MACARONI
AND CHEESE IN THE FRIDGE.

02:53.267 --> 02:56.400
- I'LL BE IN THERE.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.800
- HEY, HOW'S MICHAEL?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.067
- PERFECTLY FINE.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.500
HE'S READING COMICS.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.067
- WELL, IS HE GOING
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW?

03:04.067 --> 03:05.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.800
- HE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL
AGAIN TODAY?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.033
- YEP.
DEBRA COULDN'T GET HIM TO GO.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.633
- NEITHER COULD YOU!

03:11.633 --> 03:13.633
- WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, DEBRA.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.333
- I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD, MARIE.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.800
- I MEAN,
YOU LET THE KIDS PLAY

03:17.800 --> 03:20.800
ALL THOSE
COMPUTER VIDEOTRONIC GAMES.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.367
AND AFTER THAT,
SCHOOL IS JUST BORING TO THEM.

03:24.367 --> 03:27.233
IT'S JUST
AN OLD LADY TALKING.

03:27.233 --> 03:31.367
- WHERE DO YOU GET
THOSE VIDEOTRONIC GAMES?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.833
- WHY DO I SAY ANYTHING?

03:34.833 --> 03:36.767
- EXACTLY.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.133
- SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MICHAEL?

03:40.133 --> 03:41.400
- [sighs]
NO.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.433
- HE MISSED SCHOOL
TWO DAYS IN A ROW.

03:43.433 --> 03:45.100
- TWO DAYS?
IS HE SICK?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.100
- NO.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.800
- THAT'S TRUANCY.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.133
NOT THAT I'D REPORT IT,

03:51.133 --> 03:52.233
BUT PLEASE,
DON'T MAKE ME CHOOSE

03:52.233 --> 03:53.733
BETWEEN
"ROBERT THE UNCLE"

03:53.733 --> 03:57.567
AND "ROBERT THE SWORN DEFENDER
OF THE LAW."

03:57.567 --> 04:00.900
- HOW ABOUT YOU JUST STAY
"ROBERT THE STINK-FOOTED OAF"?

04:00.900 --> 04:03.167
- [laughs sarcastically]

04:03.167 --> 04:06.300
[whispering]
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.700
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.533
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.600
- HEY, DEB, I COULD SHOW YOU
A COUPLE OF TECHNIQUES I USED

04:14.600 --> 04:16.467
TO GET THESE TWO MUTTS
OUT OF BED.

04:16.467 --> 04:20.600
- WE'RE NOT GONNA PUT ICE CUBES
DOWN HIS PANTS, DAD.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.267
- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU START WITH THAT.

04:22.267 --> 04:23.933
I'M SAYING YOU START
WITH WHAT I USED TO CALL

04:23.933 --> 04:27.267
"THE DIRTY SOCK ALARM CLOCK."

04:28.967 --> 04:31.800
- OH, FRANK,
THAT WAS DISGUSTING.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.133
- YOU REACH WAY DOWN
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HAMPER.

04:34.133 --> 04:37.100
- WE'RE NOT DOING THAT,
FRANK.

04:37.100 --> 04:41.633
- IT'S CALLED
"TOUGH, SMELLY LOVE."

04:41.633 --> 04:45.333
- SOMETIMES HE'D USE
MY OWN SOCK AGAINST ME.

04:51.633 --> 04:54.433
- HOW COME MICHAEL
DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL?

04:54.433 --> 04:56.533
- NOBODY WANTS
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.733
HE DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK.
- LISTEN TO ME.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.967
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW TO MOTIVATE A KID?

05:00.967 --> 05:03.200
YOU GET HIM SOMETHING
HE REALLY LOVES,

05:03.200 --> 05:05.900
THEN TAKE IT AWAY.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.167
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.
- HE LIKES TRAINS, RIGHT?

05:08.167 --> 05:10.800
SO YOU GET HIM A NICE,
NEW STEAM LOCOMOTIVE--

05:10.800 --> 05:13.967
SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIS FACE
REALLY LIGHT UP.

05:13.967 --> 05:17.533
THEN YOU GET A HAMMER.

05:24.667 --> 05:27.100
- WE'RE NOT GONNA
SMASH HIS TRAINS.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.233
- DOES HE HAVE
A TURTLE?

05:31.267 --> 05:33.700
- WELL, YOU HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING, DEBRA.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.967
- WHY IS THIS ALL ON ME?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.167
WHAT ABOUT HIM?
HE LIVES HERE.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.567
- HEY, I TRIED.

05:37.567 --> 05:39.133
I HAD HIM HALFWAY
OUT THE DOOR THIS MORNING,

05:39.133 --> 05:41.467
BUT SHE WOULDN'T BITE
HIS HANDS.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.600
- YEAH, THEN YOU RUN OFF
TO WORK, AND I'M STUCK.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
YOU KNOW, I HAD A LOT OF THINGS
TO DO TODAY,

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
AND I COULDN'T BECAUSE
I HAD TO STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.400
- THERE'S ALWAYS TIME
TO GET YOUR HAIR DONE, DEAR.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.500
- I WASN'T GOING
TO DO MY HAIR.

05:54.500 --> 05:58.167
- OH.

05:58.167 --> 06:01.067
WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT THAT TOO.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.400
- YOU WANT ME
TO GO UP THERE

06:02.400 --> 06:04.433
AND EXPLAIN THE TRUANCY LAWS
IN THIS COUNTY?

06:04.433 --> 06:07.567
MAYBE DRIVE HIM BY THE DOCK,
SHOW HIM A COUPLE BUMS?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.600
- I'LL GO WITH YA.
WHERE'S THE HAMPER?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.300
- NO, NO, ALL RIGHT,
STOP, HERE.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.200
LOOK, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR MEDIEVAL ADVICE.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.967
BUT WE'LL DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, OKAY?

06:17.967 --> 06:19.467
MICHAEL IS GOING
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

06:19.467 --> 06:20.733
- YEAH, BUT IF THERE'S
A PROBLEM--

06:20.733 --> 06:22.333
- THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A PROBLEM.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.933
- BUT IF THERE IS--
- THERE'S NOT GONNA BE.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.533
- BUT IF THERE IS--

06:26.533 --> 06:28.933
- NOT GONNA.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.833
- I WON'T BE HERE,
'CAUSE I'M DRIVING ALLY'S CLASS

06:30.833 --> 06:32.033
TO THEIR FIELD TRIP TOMORROW.

06:32.033 --> 06:33.300
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

06:33.300 --> 06:34.833
WHO'S GONNA
GET HIM OUT OF BED?

06:34.833 --> 06:36.133
- I WAS THINKING YOU.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.167
- WELL, WHAT--
WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?

06:38.167 --> 06:39.667
- THIS IS PART OF YOUR JOB.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.600
- I MEAN MY REAL JOB.

06:47.567 --> 06:49.500
LET'S NOT FIGHT.

06:51.433 --> 06:53.233
OH, COME ON, MICHAEL,
GO TO SCHOOL!

06:53.233 --> 06:55.600
YOU'RE KILLIN' ME, MAN!

06:55.600 --> 06:57.600
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- LOOK, HE'S BUSTIN' MY HUMP.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.567
YOU GOT TO DO THIS, OKAY?
I'M GONNA BE LATE.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.700
- NO, HONEY, I GOT TEN KIDS
WAITING FOR ME, AND I'M LATE.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.033
- BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
I'M SWAMPED HERE.

07:03.033 --> 07:04.400
I GOT TO FINISH TWO COLUMNS,

07:04.400 --> 07:05.700
AND I GOT TO INTERVIEW
GEORGE STEINBRENNER!

07:05.700 --> 07:07.500
- SORRY, RAY, I GOT TO GO.
- NO, NO, YOU--

07:07.500 --> 07:10.033
YOU COME BACK HERE,
YOUNG LADY!

07:10.033 --> 07:12.500
OLD LADY!

07:12.500 --> 07:17.667
WHO REMINDS ME
OF MY MOM!

07:17.667 --> 07:19.600
[door slams]

07:21.033 --> 07:23.167
[groans]

07:30.900 --> 07:33.133
ALL RIGHT.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.467
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.

07:35.467 --> 07:39.033
BUT YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

07:40.833 --> 07:42.167
OH, GREAT.

07:42.167 --> 07:45.300
THE ONE DAY
SHE DOES LAUNDRY.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.900
- YES, HI.
UH, THIS IS RAY BARONE.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.300
UM, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME DOWN

07:57.300 --> 07:59.567
AND INTERVIEW
MR. STEINBRENNER THIS MORNING,

07:59.567 --> 08:02.300
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

08:02.300 --> 08:05.767
WELL, UH,
KIND OF A--

08:05.767 --> 08:08.033
FAMILY TRAGEDY.

08:08.033 --> 08:09.567
YEAH.

08:09.567 --> 08:11.167
NO, NO, NO,
I WAS JUST WONDERING,

08:11.167 --> 08:13.167
UM, COULD WE DO THIS
ON THE PHONE?

08:13.167 --> 08:16.200
YES, YEAH, I'LL HOLD.
THANK YOU.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.800
WELL, LOOK WHO'S UP.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.100
- I'M HUNGRY.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.367
- YEAH, WELL,
BREAKFAST TIME ENDED

08:21.367 --> 08:23.067
WHEN THE SCHOOL BUS LEFT,
OKAY?

08:23.067 --> 08:25.067
SO CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GET
TO STAY HOME AGAIN TODAY.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.233
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
MISTER.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.867
A COUPLE OF HOURS
WITH DADDY,

08:27.867 --> 08:30.700
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BEGGING
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.967
HELLO.
OH, HI.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.567
OH, YEAH,

08:38.033 --> 08:41.500
MY--MOTHER.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.033
YEAH, BUT, UH,
SHE'LL PULL THROUGH.

08:43.033 --> 08:44.533
SHE'S A TOUGH OLD BROAD.

08:44.533 --> 08:46.567
ANYWAY, UM, LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,

08:46.567 --> 08:48.800
AND I JUST WANTED

08:48.800 --> 08:50.700
[TV blaring]

08:50.700 --> 08:53.800
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND, SIR.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.233
NO TV!

08:59.100 --> 09:01.033
YEAH, HELLO?
I'M SORRY.

09:01.033 --> 09:02.333
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
NO, NO, NO.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.200
NO, I CAN DO THIS.
SURE, YEAH.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
UM, OKAY, WELL, MAINLY,
I WANTED TO START

09:06.400 --> 09:09.733
BY GETTING YOUR FEELINGS
ON REVENUE SHARING.

09:09.733 --> 09:13.300
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.767
[whispering]

THE SMALLER MARKETS?

09:23.833 --> 09:25.700
HEY!

09:25.700 --> 09:27.067
YOU'RE NOT EATING DOUGHNUTS,
OKAY?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.533
NO DOUGHNUTS FOR YOU!

09:29.533 --> 09:31.900
I--YEAH, SORRY.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.167

YOU CAN'T FIRE THEM.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.600

09:59.933 --> 10:01.500

10:01.500 --> 10:02.733

10:02.733 --> 10:04.133
DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS

10:04.133 --> 10:06.700

TWO GRANDMAS ON A BIKE--

10:30.333 --> 10:32.600

I HAVE TO EAT EVERY DAY.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.333
YEAH, YEAH,

10:42.900 --> 10:45.967
HERE'S SOME DELICIOUS
SKIM MILK FOR YOU.

10:45.967 --> 10:49.100

10:50.667 --> 10:51.833
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

10:51.833 --> 10:53.267
HERE'S HOW
IT'S GONNA GO TODAY.

10:53.267 --> 10:54.633
NO CARTOONS,
NO VIDEO GAMES,

10:54.633 --> 10:57.133

10:57.133 --> 11:00.500
FIRST, YOU'RE GONNA EAT
THIS WOOD.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.267
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR HOMEWORK,

11:02.267 --> 11:04.467
AND YOU'RE GONNA COME
DOWNSTAIRS TO MY OFFICE.

11:04.467 --> 11:07.767
IT'S STUDY HALL.
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.800
YOU'RE GONNA WORK
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME

11:09.800 --> 11:12.433
WHERE I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU;
YOU GOT THAT?

11:12.433 --> 11:15.000
- I DON'T HAVE ANY HOMEWORK.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

11:16.600 --> 11:20.233
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE, HUH?

11:20.233 --> 11:21.633
I MAY SEEM STUPID,

11:21.633 --> 11:23.067
BUT THAT'S JUST
TO GET YOUR MOTHER

11:23.067 --> 11:27.200
TO NOT ASK ME
TO DO STUFF, OKAY?

11:29.733 --> 11:31.267
I KNOW ALL THE ANGLES, PAL.

11:31.267 --> 11:32.933
I KNOW ALL THE EXCUSES.

11:32.933 --> 11:35.733
IF MY DOG SHAMSKI HAD EATEN
AS MUCH HOMEWORK AS I SAID,

11:35.733 --> 11:40.167
HE WOULD HAVE POOPED
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.700
ALL RIGHT?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.067
SO YOU JUST EAT THIS,

11:43.067 --> 11:44.433
AND THEN YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR HOMEWORK,

11:44.433 --> 11:46.333
AND YOU'RE
COMING DOWNSTAIRS.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.467
- I DON'T HAVE ANY.

11:48.467 --> 11:51.567
- YOU'RE STICKING
WITH THAT STORY, HUH?

11:51.567 --> 11:53.100
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.333
THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA
COME DOWNSTAIRS,

11:54.333 --> 11:56.133
AND YOU'RE GONNA
WATCH ME WORK.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.100
YOU THINK SCHOOL IS BORING
AND MEANINGLESS.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.600
WAIT'LL YOU SEE
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.267
OH, CAPTAIN SUGAR.
HE'S COMING WITH ME.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.400
HEY, LOOK,
A PRIZE!

12:12.267 --> 12:13.867
- THIS IS BORING.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.600
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.267
BET YOU WISH YOU WERE
BACK AT SCHOOL RIGHT NOW, HUH?

12:20.267 --> 12:22.800

12:22.800 --> 12:26.067
DON'T WORRY;
WE'LL BE DONE HERE IN ABOUT...

12:26.067 --> 12:29.800
OH, FIVE HOURS.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.733
[giggles]

12:39.800 --> 12:41.433
HEY, WHA--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:41.433 --> 12:42.333
- READING.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.967
- NO, NO, NO.
COMICS IS NOT--

12:44.967 --> 12:48.467
WHAT IS SHE WEARING?

12:48.467 --> 12:49.833
THEY SHOULD HAVE
RATINGS ON THIS,

12:49.833 --> 12:53.167
'CAUSE THIS IS
TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

13:02.267 --> 13:04.433
ALL RIGHT, PAY ATTENTION.
I'M GONNA--

13:04.433 --> 13:06.533
I'M GONNA READ YOU SOMETHING
THAT I'M WORKING ON.

13:06.533 --> 13:08.833
IT'S, UH,
A BASEBALL COLUMN.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.067
"EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAYS
THE DESIGNATED HITTER

13:12.067 --> 13:13.933
"HAS TAKEN THE STRATEGY
OUT OF THE GAME.

13:13.933 --> 13:16.900
"YOU KNOW, IS THE MANAGER
GONNA PINCH-HIT FOR THE PITCHER,

13:16.900 --> 13:18.300
"OR IS HE GONNA
LEAVE HIM IN?

13:18.300 --> 13:20.233
"I SAY, WHAT'S SO EXCITING

13:20.233 --> 13:25.033
ABOUT WATCHING
SOME FAT MANAGER THINK?"

13:25.033 --> 13:28.067
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
- GOOD.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.567
- YEAH?
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT?

13:30.567 --> 13:33.700
- THE FAT MANAGER.

13:33.700 --> 13:37.133
- IT'S KINDA FUNNY,
ISN'T IT?

13:39.967 --> 13:43.100
[sighs]
ALL RIGHT.

13:47.267 --> 13:50.000
- THE KIDS TEASED ME.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.367
- WHAT?

13:51.367 --> 13:54.233
- IN MY CLASS,
ALL THE KIDS LAUGHED AT ME.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.400
- THE KIDS LAUGHED AT YOU?
WHY?

13:56.400 --> 13:59.133
- I WENT UP TO THE TEACHER
TO ASK HER A QUESTION,

13:59.133 --> 14:02.267
AND I ACCIDENTALLY
SAID, "MOMMY."

14:04.000 --> 14:07.067
- YOU CALLED
THE TEACHER "MOMMY"?

14:07.067 --> 14:10.200
WHY?
WAS THE TEACHER YELLING?

14:18.400 --> 14:21.600
- THEN I CRIED,
AND EVERYBODY CALLED ME CRYBABY.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.900
- [sighs]

14:36.900 --> 14:40.033
I MADE YOU EAT THE FIBER.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.267
HEY--

14:55.267 --> 14:56.833
SPEAKING OF BASEBALL,

14:56.833 --> 15:00.800
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE STORY
ABOUT ME IN LITTLE LEAGUE?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.533
IT'S KINDA FUNNY.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.767
IT'S, UH--

15:04.767 --> 15:06.267
I WAS A LITTLE OLDER THAN YOU,

15:06.267 --> 15:08.633
AND RIGHT BEFORE THE GAME,

15:08.633 --> 15:12.033
I HAD JUST DRANK
A LOT OF KOOL-AID.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.567
SO I HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM,

15:13.567 --> 15:16.333
BUT I DECIDED TO HOLD IT,
'CAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,

15:16.333 --> 15:18.533
I DIDN'T LIKE GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

15:18.533 --> 15:20.067
NOW I LIKE GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.833
I LIKE IT A LOT.

15:22.833 --> 15:26.100
SO, IT'S THE THIRD INNING,

15:26.100 --> 15:27.733
AND I'M PLAYING
SECOND BASE,

15:27.733 --> 15:29.467
AND I GOT TO GO REAL BAD.

15:29.467 --> 15:31.833
AND I'M--I'M SCRUNCHING
MY LEGS TOGETHER,

15:31.833 --> 15:34.633
AND I'M BANGING MY MITT
AGAINST MY THIGH,

15:34.633 --> 15:37.367
AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP UP
THE CHATTER REAL LOUD.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.233
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
IF I SCREAMED LOUD ENOUGH,

15:39.233 --> 15:40.433
IT WOULD DISTRACT ME.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.900
YOU KNOW,
"HEY, BATTER, BATTER,

15:41.900 --> 15:45.067
HEY, BATTER, BATTER,
HEY, BATTER, BATTER, SWING!"

15:45.067 --> 15:49.200
BUT, I COULDN'T HOLD IT.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.033
I STARTED TO GO.

15:52.033 --> 15:54.300
- YOU WERE ON THE FIELD?

15:54.300 --> 15:58.267
- RIGHT BETWEEN
FIRST AND SECOND.

15:58.267 --> 16:03.000
IT--IT--IT FELT SO BAD...

16:03.000 --> 16:06.133
AND YET SO GOOD.

16:10.233 --> 16:11.900
I STILL TRIED
TO KEEP UP THE CHATTER,

16:11.900 --> 16:13.933
BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE,

16:13.933 --> 16:17.533
[weak, high-pitched]
"HEY, BATTER, BATTER, HEY.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.400
"HEY, BATTER.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.333
SWING."

16:26.167 --> 16:27.633
SO THIS--

16:27.633 --> 16:31.067
THIS DARK SPOT
IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.567
BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO NOTICE,

16:32.567 --> 16:34.400
SO I JUST THOUGHT
SOON AS THE INNING'S OVER,

16:34.400 --> 16:35.867
I'M JUST GONNA
RUN OFF THE FIELD.

16:35.867 --> 16:38.733
I'M GONNA JUMP ON MY BIKE,
AND RIDE HOME.

16:38.733 --> 16:40.233
JUST THEN, I LOOK UP,
AND THERE'S

16:40.233 --> 16:41.767
DAVE MALLOY
ON OUR BENCH.

16:41.767 --> 16:46.333
[simulating slow-mo audio]
HE-E-E-E-E-E-EY!

16:46.333 --> 16:52.133
LOOK AT B-A-A-A-R-O-N-E!"

16:59.633 --> 17:04.633
I LOOK UP, AND ALL THE KIDS
ARE LAUGHING AT ME--

17:04.633 --> 17:06.400
MY OWN TEAMMATES.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.000
THEY WERE POUNDING THE FENCE,
THEY WERE LAUGHING SO HARD.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.733
AND--

17:10.733 --> 17:12.100
[sighs]

17:12.100 --> 17:16.333
THERE I WAS
AT SECOND BASE...

17:16.333 --> 17:20.033
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF EVERYTHING.

17:20.033 --> 17:21.767
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:21.767 --> 17:25.367
- I DID EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

17:25.367 --> 17:26.800
I CRIED.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.900
I BAWLED MY EYES OUT.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.567
I SHOULD'VE CRIED EARLIER.

17:30.567 --> 17:34.700
MAYBE IT WOULD'VE DIVERTED
SOME OF THE PEE INTO TEARS.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.033
- REALLY?

17:36.033 --> 17:39.800
- NAH, THE BODY
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

17:39.800 --> 17:44.767
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW HOW IN BASEBALL
YOU WANT A COOL NICKNAME?

17:44.767 --> 17:48.200
YOU KNOW, LIKE "HAMMERIN' HANK"
OR "THE BIG HURT"?

17:48.200 --> 17:50.100
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE KIDS CALLED ME?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.933
"PEE-PEE" RAYMOND.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.733
THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER, HUH?
"PEE-PEE" RAYMOND.

17:54.733 --> 17:58.167
"'PEE-PEE' RAYMOND!
'PEE-PEE' RAYMOND!"

17:58.167 --> 18:03.433
THAT WAS ME--
"PEE-PEE" RAYMOND.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.967
YEAH.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.567
THAT WAS A BAD DAY.

18:07.567 --> 18:10.600
IT WAS LIKE I HAD
A RAIN DELAY IN MY PANTS.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.533
- [laughs]

18:17.800 --> 18:20.667
- SO--

18:20.667 --> 18:22.600
THAT'S BASEBALL.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.900
OH, BY THE WAY,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.233
COUPLE DAYS LATER,

18:31.233 --> 18:33.400
KEVIN SAGANSKI
IS AT THE BLACKBOARD.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.167
HE BENDS DOWN
TO PICK UP SOME CHALK,

18:36.167 --> 18:38.400
HIS PANTS SPLIT WIDE OPEN.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.433
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I'M OFF THE HOOK, YOU KNOW?

18:41.433 --> 18:44.167
"PEE-PEE" RAYMOND,
IT'S OLD NEWS NOW.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.633
THE TALK OF THE TOWN?

18:45.633 --> 18:47.933
"BUTT-CRACK" SAGANSKI.

18:47.933 --> 18:51.167
[both chuckling]

18:51.167 --> 18:52.667
- THAT'S FUNNY.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.167
- YEAH.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.300
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.600
- DADDY?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.533
- YEAH?

19:02.533 --> 19:07.033
- I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

19:07.033 --> 19:10.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ME TOO.

19:12.033 --> 19:13.767
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

19:13.767 --> 19:15.733
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO "BUTT-CRACK" SAGANSKI?

19:15.733 --> 19:17.300
- WHAT?

19:17.300 --> 19:21.400
- HE'S NOW THE PRESIDENT
OF FRUIT OF THE LOOM UNDERWEAR.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.033
- OH, YEAH!

19:28.033 --> 19:32.300
DAD'S STILL GOT
THE MOVES, MIKEY!

19:32.300 --> 19:34.967
I'M GOING OFF THE MAT!

19:34.967 --> 19:36.100
WHOO!

19:36.100 --> 19:37.900
I AM ON FIRE!

19:37.900 --> 19:41.033
- HI, MOMMY.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:49.367 --> 19:52.733
- WHAT AM I DOING?
I'M GETTING ALL FUNKY, BABY!

19:55.600 --> 19:57.533
TAKE OVER, YEAH.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.933
THAT'S HEREDITARY,
THAT FUNK.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.800
- SO THIS IS YOUR SOLUTION?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.700
LET HIM STAY HOME ALL DAY
AND HAVE A DANCE PARTY?

20:08.700 --> 20:11.500
HE'S NEVER GONNA
GO TO SCHOOL AGAIN.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
- MICHAEL, YOU GOING
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.433

'CAUSE HE CALLED
ONE OF THE TEACHERS "MOMMY."

20:49.467 --> 20:51.533
