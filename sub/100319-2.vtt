02:19.709 --> 02:21.119
Mama needs an update.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.976
Please, come on in.

02:24.671 --> 02:27.458
So, what exactly

02:27.483 --> 02:29.484
is the look we're going for in here?

02:29.509 --> 02:31.054
Third-grade science fair?

02:31.079 --> 02:32.864
Ooh, white girl corporate housing?

02:32.889 --> 02:35.288
Or "she was quiet and kept to herself"?

02:35.313 --> 02:37.867
Uh, I just don't spend a ton
of time in my apartment, and...

02:37.892 --> 02:40.843
I can see why not. So, tell me.

02:40.868 --> 02:42.789
What's the latest on this
musical power of yours?

02:42.814 --> 02:44.492
Hear anybody new sing their feelings

02:44.517 --> 02:45.554
out loud to you lately?

02:45.579 --> 02:47.034
Thank you for asking, Mo.

02:47.059 --> 02:48.636
I appreciate you being so concerned.

02:48.660 --> 02:49.851
No, no, don't be flattered.

02:49.876 --> 02:51.854
I view you more as a social experiment,

02:51.879 --> 02:53.398
Like a rat running through a maze

02:53.423 --> 02:55.945
or that one time that I
kissed a girl in college.

02:57.055 --> 02:59.185
To be honest, um,

02:59.210 --> 03:01.816
my musical power isn't going so great.

03:02.132 --> 03:05.153
Because of whatever this new ability is,

03:05.177 --> 03:07.989
I discovered that all the
programmers at work hate me.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.959
On the other hand, I was able to
communicate with my dad again

03:10.984 --> 03:12.360
and bond with my office crush.

03:12.384 --> 03:14.529
On the other hand,
my office crush has a fiancée,

03:14.553 --> 03:16.734
and my best friend is in love with me.

03:16.845 --> 03:18.266
Or at least thinks he's in love with me.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.343
He did say, "I think I love you,"

03:20.368 --> 03:22.750
when he sang, so hopefully
that'll just blow over.

03:22.775 --> 03:25.055
I'm sorry. I got bored about three
"on the other hands" ago.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.915
There just doesn't seem
to be any rhyme or reason

03:26.939 --> 03:28.382
for when a song happens, Mo,

03:28.407 --> 03:30.710
and I need to figure out
how to control it A.S.A.P.

03:30.735 --> 03:33.875
so that it doesn't get in the way
of my job or my sporadic attempts

03:33.900 --> 03:35.544
at something resembling a social life.

03:35.569 --> 03:36.947
As a resident music expert,

03:36.972 --> 03:38.469
I do have some
theories I'd like to try out.

03:38.493 --> 03:39.960
I don't have time right now, okay?

03:39.985 --> 03:41.305
I have to go meet my family, and then

03:41.329 --> 03:42.930
I have to give a big speech
at work this morning.

03:42.954 --> 03:44.984
I get it. You're busy. I'm busy, too.

03:45.009 --> 03:46.720
I don't just wake up looking like this.

03:46.745 --> 03:48.672
Can you meet me at The
Golden Gate Grind at lunch?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.546
Mm, sounds bougie. I'm in.

04:00.962 --> 04:03.437
This is literally the
fourth doctor's office

04:03.462 --> 04:05.032
I've been in this week.
I mean, between Dad

04:05.056 --> 04:06.851
and all of Emily's prenatal exams,

04:06.876 --> 04:08.524
I don't think I've seen
this many physicians

04:08.548 --> 04:11.093
since you were convinced I
had A.D.D. when I was nine.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.496
Oh, I love these things.

04:13.023 --> 04:15.070
That's a cute jacket, Zoey.

04:15.095 --> 04:17.015
Something big happening at work today?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.819
I'm giving my first speech as
the new manager of engineering.

04:19.844 --> 04:23.264
Wanna look good and be prepared
in case there's any curveballs.

04:23.289 --> 04:25.501
Yeah, like, forgetting your own name.
I'm not making fun of her.

04:25.525 --> 04:27.126
She actually wrote down, "Hi.
I'm Zoey," on here.

04:27.150 --> 04:29.375
You are gonna do great. You always do.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.476
Your dad and I are very proud of you.

04:31.501 --> 04:33.078
Isn't that right, honey?

04:37.330 --> 04:39.796
Oh, check out that
impressive hand movement.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.460
I like to see that, Mitch.

04:41.485 --> 04:44.024
Looks like you brought the whole
beautiful family with you today.

04:44.048 --> 04:46.023
Dr. Hamara, we've noticed quite a few

04:46.048 --> 04:48.255
positive changes in Mitch lately,

04:48.280 --> 04:51.710
more facial movement,
more agility in his hands.

04:51.735 --> 04:54.080
It seems like he's getting
a little bit better.

04:54.105 --> 04:55.695
Uh, is that possible?

04:55.835 --> 04:57.802
Let's take a look.

05:01.795 --> 05:03.429
Follow the pen.

05:08.311 --> 05:09.922
Squeeze my hands, will you?

05:09.947 --> 05:11.118
Not so hard.

05:11.143 --> 05:13.476
I've still got other
patients to see today.

05:14.805 --> 05:16.605
And blink for me.

05:19.835 --> 05:21.304
Here's the good news.

05:21.329 --> 05:23.101
Mitch's new meds are working.

05:23.126 --> 05:24.837
It's not a cure, but it might

05:24.862 --> 05:27.484
slow the progressive
supranuclear palsy down,

05:27.509 --> 05:29.621
give him a bit more
movement and dexterity.

05:29.646 --> 05:31.880
I'd take advantage of it if you can.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.770
Ah, Zoey, just the person
I wanted to see.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.601
I'm not in trouble, am I?

05:53.626 --> 05:56.107
What? No. Why does everyone
keep me asking that?

05:56.132 --> 05:58.507
I think maybe it's
just a tone thing that...

05:58.532 --> 06:00.414
Zoey, not a real question.

06:00.439 --> 06:02.329
Look, since it's
your first week as manager,

06:02.354 --> 06:04.332
I just wanted to check in.
How are you feeling?

06:04.356 --> 06:05.571
And, more importantly, do you have

06:05.595 --> 06:07.554
any new strategies
you'd like to implement?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.562
Well...

06:10.066 --> 06:11.623
after reading multiple books

06:11.648 --> 06:13.426
and listening to
several popular podcasts

06:13.451 --> 06:15.342
on how to be an effective leader, I...

06:15.367 --> 06:18.107
Oh, my God. Bottom line, please.

06:18.132 --> 06:20.047
I think we need more team spirit.

06:20.071 --> 06:21.616
Okay, as long as you're not
talking about instituting,

06:21.640 --> 06:23.654
like, crazy hat day or something,
in which case,

06:23.679 --> 06:25.258
you should start sending
your résumé around.

06:25.282 --> 06:27.253
No, no, nothing like that.

06:27.278 --> 06:29.189
Look, I'm sure
you've got it all figured out,

06:29.214 --> 06:31.390
but if you want some advice, here it is.

06:31.686 --> 06:33.898
Be strong, be bold,

06:33.923 --> 06:35.820
and keep your personal life to yourself.

06:36.382 --> 06:37.515
Now get out of here.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.710
- Oh.
- You have work to do. Jesus.

06:39.735 --> 06:40.953
Thank you, Joan.

06:42.723 --> 06:45.601
Um, guys,

06:45.626 --> 06:47.421
coders, friends.

06:47.814 --> 06:49.021
Hey.

06:49.046 --> 06:52.446
Uh, I realized, as the manager,

06:52.470 --> 06:54.257
I didn't give a big introductory speech,

06:54.282 --> 06:58.945
so hello, best programming team ever.

06:58.970 --> 07:01.421
Whoo! Best programming team ever!

07:01.984 --> 07:03.117
Thanks, Max.

07:03.142 --> 07:06.354
Um, I have lots of ideas

07:06.379 --> 07:10.531
for how to make this a
positive work environment

07:10.556 --> 07:12.034
and for how we can be

07:12.059 --> 07:15.168
a harmonious, well-functioning team.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.984
Uh, I thought we were
a well-functioning team,

07:18.009 --> 07:20.187
hence the "best
programming team ever" part.

07:20.212 --> 07:22.157
Good team can always
be better, can't it?

07:22.182 --> 07:26.242
So, with that in mind,
I have two things to hand out.

07:26.267 --> 07:29.649
First is a tiny memo with
some small suggestions

07:29.673 --> 07:31.148
just to kick things off.

07:31.173 --> 07:33.693
Tiny memo?
This thing has a table of contents.

07:33.718 --> 07:37.291
Mm-hmm. And the second
are journals that I bought

07:37.315 --> 07:39.046
for everyone for you to write down

07:39.071 --> 07:42.610
your daily progress, inspirations.
Pick your color.

07:42.635 --> 07:45.932
I have kept one myself every day

07:45.957 --> 07:47.383
since my first day of the job.

07:47.408 --> 07:49.875
Oh, cool. I've always wanted a diary.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.969
Are you there, God? It's me, Tobin.

07:52.298 --> 07:54.289
It's nice to write down

07:54.314 --> 07:57.477
your inspirations and
ideas before they just...

08:00.406 --> 08:03.009

I think you were explaining
what a journal is for.

09:34.581 --> 09:37.525
Right. Um, how about
you read the section

09:37.550 --> 09:40.041
on, um, better work efficiency

09:40.066 --> 09:41.706
and how not to be
distracted in the workplace,

09:41.730 --> 09:44.072
and we'll... reconvene later.

09:44.097 --> 09:45.408
Go, team.

09:45.433 --> 09:47.578
Whoo! Go, team!

09:47.603 --> 09:49.136
You're yelling, bro.

09:54.447 --> 09:55.635
Hey.

09:56.768 --> 09:59.380
Hey, friendo.

09:59.405 --> 10:01.948
Great news. I won the lottery.

10:02.486 --> 10:04.697
- What?
- Well, the restaurant lottery.

10:04.722 --> 10:07.067
I finally got us into that
fancy farm-to-table place.

10:07.091 --> 10:09.018
You got us into Hand-Picked?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.009
Yeah, Thursday night. Is it a date?

10:11.795 --> 10:13.126
Is it a date?

10:13.151 --> 10:14.782
What? No.

10:14.807 --> 10:17.244
I just mean like, can you go?
Why are you acting weird?

10:17.268 --> 10:19.587
Am I acting weirder than normal?

10:19.612 --> 10:21.881
Hard to tell.
Anyway, they're doing this fancy,

10:21.905 --> 10:23.509
uh, 10-course tasting meal and...

10:23.534 --> 10:25.571
- Sounds romantic.
- Or delicious.

10:25.596 --> 10:27.205
Do you know that they
make their own butter?

10:27.229 --> 10:29.257
Apparently there's an actual
cow on the premises and...

10:29.281 --> 10:30.626
What's happening over here?

10:30.651 --> 10:32.798
Nothing. Not a thing.

10:32.823 --> 10:34.603
Max, you remember Simon.

10:34.628 --> 10:36.106
Uh, well, we haven't officially met yet,

10:36.130 --> 10:38.384
but Zoey might have mentioned
your name once or twice.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.343
Or... Well, it's a very common name.

10:40.367 --> 10:41.808
You know, maybe it actually wasn't you.

10:41.832 --> 10:42.870
You two must be close.

10:42.895 --> 10:44.410
I feel like I see you
together all the time.

10:44.434 --> 10:45.785
Just close the way friends are close

10:45.809 --> 10:46.956
when they're friends with each other.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.518
Yeah. What she said.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.358
Listen, Zoey,
I've got a project for your team

10:51.383 --> 10:52.759
I need to talk to you about.

10:52.784 --> 10:55.329
Great. Let's go talk about it.

10:55.448 --> 10:56.777
Max, let me just check my schedge,

10:56.801 --> 10:58.682
and I'll get back to you
about that dinner ASAP.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.238
Was that code for

11:01.263 --> 11:02.574
"I've got some heavy
dad stuff to unpack?"

11:02.598 --> 11:04.300
No. This is actually a real work thing.

11:04.325 --> 11:05.602
- Oh.
- The marketing team

11:05.626 --> 11:07.304
is gonna throw a
party here at the offices

11:07.328 --> 11:09.372
to get the word out about
the new Sprq Point Watch.

11:09.396 --> 11:12.163
And you want me to post about it,

11:12.188 --> 11:14.720
'cause my Insta's blowing up right now.

11:14.745 --> 11:16.880
Pretty sure I've got
at least 12 followers.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.150
Uh, thanks, but we already
sent out beta versions

11:20.174 --> 11:22.486
to various bloggers and
YouTubers and tech titans

11:22.510 --> 11:24.054
months ago, so I think we're covered.

11:24.078 --> 11:25.789
Okay, well, my followers
are gonna be devastated,

11:25.813 --> 11:27.167
but, you know, do what you gotta do.

11:27.191 --> 11:29.024
However, here's how
I could use your help.

11:29.049 --> 11:30.961
I talked to Joan, and she said your team

11:30.985 --> 11:32.796
could send push
notifications on the watch

11:32.820 --> 11:34.298
as an official party invite?

11:34.323 --> 11:35.323
Anything specific?

11:35.348 --> 11:37.394
Blast to all the beta users
with the party details...

11:37.418 --> 11:39.737
- Time, place, whatnot.
- I could do that.

11:39.886 --> 11:41.510
Or...

11:42.649 --> 11:45.784
we could have a little bit
more fun with it instead.

11:46.987 --> 11:48.744
What'd you have in mind?

11:48.769 --> 11:52.290
We could turn the whole thing
into a massive scavenger hunt.

11:52.315 --> 11:55.252
- Oh.
- Um, we could push live clues

11:55.276 --> 11:57.053
to everyone's watches.

11:57.077 --> 11:59.995
Taking them to different
landmarks all around the city.

12:00.354 --> 12:03.560
We then merge them into even
bigger groups as they go,

12:03.584 --> 12:05.862
and, once they've
converged into a critical mass,

12:05.886 --> 12:09.463
the final clue will lead
them here for a total rager.

12:09.488 --> 12:10.792
Boo-yah!

12:13.093 --> 12:15.659
I'm so sorry.

12:15.684 --> 12:19.064
It's okay. Just a major
humanitarian award I won.

12:19.089 --> 12:20.274
Super sentimental.

12:20.299 --> 12:22.274
- No biggie.
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.712 --> 12:27.449
Believe it or not, I didn't really
play any sports growing up.

12:27.474 --> 12:29.641
I'm not surprised by that information.

12:31.763 --> 12:34.575
I gotta say, it is nice to
talk to you about something

12:34.600 --> 12:37.001
other than dead and dying dads for once.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.362
That reminds me,

12:39.386 --> 12:41.231
I actually got some good
news about my father today.

12:41.255 --> 12:43.433
The new drug he's on seems to
be having some positive effects.

12:43.457 --> 12:44.634
That's amazing, Zoey. I love that.

12:44.658 --> 12:46.036
What does that mean?

12:46.060 --> 12:48.329
It means a tiny bit more mobility

12:48.354 --> 12:50.329
and a few more facial expressions.

12:50.598 --> 12:52.542
We'll take the win.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.470
All right.

12:56.670 --> 12:59.062
Uh, have your team
start working on the art,

12:59.087 --> 13:00.920
and I'll get my team on the tech.

13:04.005 --> 13:05.626
It happened again.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.090
I heard Max sing another
love song to me this morning,

13:08.115 --> 13:11.661
and, this time, it seemed way
less ambiguous than last time.

13:11.685 --> 13:13.129
Mm, what song was it?

13:13.153 --> 13:15.065
- "Sucker."
- Ooh, that song's hot.

13:15.089 --> 13:17.067
- How did Max look doing it?
- It doesn't matter.

13:17.091 --> 13:20.017
My best friend is super into me, Mo,

13:20.042 --> 13:22.921
and now he wants me to go to
Hand-Picked for dinner with him.

13:22.946 --> 13:24.532
He won the lottery? Huh.

13:24.557 --> 13:26.635
So go. He doesn't know
you're aware of how he feels.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.677
But I know, and I can't unknow it.

13:28.702 --> 13:30.680
And I don't want to talk
about his feelings with him,

13:30.704 --> 13:32.546
and I don't wanna live
in the awkwardness.

13:32.571 --> 13:33.752
With everything that's
going on in my life,

13:33.776 --> 13:36.752
I just want to keep things
exactly how they are between us.

13:36.777 --> 13:38.521
Then, tell him you got
sick or that Hand-Picked

13:38.545 --> 13:40.257
uses store-bought arugula or something.

13:40.282 --> 13:42.025
It's bigger than just one dinner.

13:42.049 --> 13:44.294
Max is becoming a
major distraction at work.

13:44.318 --> 13:47.712
I can't focus and be the
team leader that I need to be

13:47.737 --> 13:50.203
with him singing heart
songs to me all the time.

13:50.228 --> 13:51.735
- Heart songs?
- I just coined the phrase.

13:51.759 --> 13:52.798
I'll allow it.

13:53.470 --> 13:55.968
I've got to figure out
how to control this thing

13:55.993 --> 13:59.743
and get Max off me so I
don't lose my mind or my job.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.445
Uh, Zo-ldilocks, calm down.

14:02.469 --> 14:05.849
I have the answer to all of
your musical-based problems.

14:05.873 --> 14:08.962
These are the best
noise-canceling headphones

14:08.987 --> 14:10.470
in the entire world.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.855
I wear them to sleep,
when I'm DJing at the club,

14:12.880 --> 14:15.914
every time an Uber driver says,
"How's your day going?"

14:16.353 --> 14:17.656
They're incredible.

14:17.681 --> 14:19.162
Ooh, check them out.

14:19.187 --> 14:21.688
Looks like they're trying
to make a baby up in here.

15:32.345 --> 15:33.968
Uh, I think it's Whitney Houston.

15:33.993 --> 15:37.205
You think Whit...
This power is wasted on you.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.073

- Now they're in the middle

15:39.097 --> 15:42.444
of some sort of emotional
dance-slash-instrumental break.

Hey, Zoey. The usual?

16:42.162 --> 16:45.842
Yeah. And, actually,
I think I'll get something to go...

16:45.866 --> 16:47.452
for my buddy, Max.

16:47.477 --> 16:50.456
Speaking of Max,
what's your take on Max?

16:50.481 --> 16:52.114
You like his vibe? Appearance?

16:52.139 --> 16:53.650
General outlook? You a fan?

16:53.674 --> 16:55.468
- Um, Zoey?
- Working here, Mo.

16:55.493 --> 16:58.654
Sure, he's cute and funny, I guess.

16:58.679 --> 17:00.091
Why are you asking?

17:00.116 --> 17:02.325
Oh, no reason. Just curious.

17:02.349 --> 17:04.160
But, you know,
while we're shooting the breeze,

17:04.184 --> 17:07.616
what do you, uh,
think about farm-to-table food?

17:07.641 --> 17:09.164
Oh, I love it.

17:09.189 --> 17:11.467
Have you heard of
this place Hand-Picked?

17:11.491 --> 17:14.804
Turns out they have an
actual cow on the premises.

17:14.829 --> 17:18.212
- How great is that?
- So, so great.

17:20.642 --> 17:22.102
Is this weird?

17:22.127 --> 17:23.505
This feels weird.

17:23.529 --> 17:24.986
Are you sure he's cool with it?

17:25.011 --> 17:26.306
Are you kidding?

17:26.330 --> 17:28.861
Max is the coolest.

17:28.886 --> 17:30.290
Come here.

17:31.045 --> 17:32.790
- Max.
- Hey.

17:32.815 --> 17:34.982
Guess what? I used Dijkstra's algorithm

17:35.007 --> 17:37.634
to find the shortest paths
between all the hunt locations

17:37.659 --> 17:40.337
so we can make sure our
guests get to where the... Hi.

17:40.362 --> 17:42.022
Max, you remember Autumn

17:42.047 --> 17:44.400
from our favorite place,
The Golden Gate Grind.

17:44.425 --> 17:45.728
Yeah. Hi, Autumn.

17:45.753 --> 17:48.328
Uh, did we win free coffee or something?

17:48.353 --> 17:49.712
Better than that.

17:49.737 --> 17:53.001
So, turns out I got a
family thing Thursday night.

17:53.026 --> 17:55.202
- Oh. What?
- But Autumn is a huge foodie,

17:55.227 --> 17:57.605
and she would love to go
to dinner in my place.

17:57.629 --> 17:59.808
But only if you're cool with it.

17:59.832 --> 18:02.343
I promise I will still
serve you your black coffee

18:02.367 --> 18:04.001
every morning if you say no.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.380
You remember my drink order?

18:06.405 --> 18:08.282
I remember everyone's order.

18:08.307 --> 18:11.218
People say I have a
foam-o-graphic memory.

18:12.031 --> 18:13.031
Well, yeah.

18:13.056 --> 18:14.823
Um, I mean, I can't
really think of anyone else

18:14.847 --> 18:18.025
I would take at the moment,
because, I mean,

18:18.050 --> 18:21.164
I just ended things with, like,
four girls last week, so...

18:21.189 --> 18:22.697
Their loss.

18:22.721 --> 18:24.384
Yeah.

18:24.409 --> 18:28.502
I gotta say I am loving the energy.

18:30.062 --> 18:32.674
So, I am gonna leave it to you two

18:32.698 --> 18:34.406
to sort out the details.

18:34.431 --> 18:35.844
Okay.

18:35.868 --> 18:37.145
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, you remember

18:37.169 --> 18:38.907
that old game we used to play, Taboo?

18:38.932 --> 18:40.715
- <i>You remember that?</i>
- Uh, I remember Dad and I

18:40.739 --> 18:41.908
crushing you and Mom at it. Why?

18:41.932 --> 18:43.572
Yeah, okay, so check this out.

18:43.597 --> 18:45.775
One buzz for yes. Two buzzes for no.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.079
<i>Watch this. Hey, Dad.</i>

18:47.104 --> 18:48.948
Do you like talking like this?

18:51.082 --> 18:53.057
<i>Would you rather watch TV?</i>

18:55.879 --> 18:58.378
Do you find that sound just
to be a little bit annoying?

19:00.184 --> 19:01.620
All right, Zoey, you try.

19:01.645 --> 19:04.800
Okay, uh, Dad, are we going too fast?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.925
Do you want me to come over later?

19:14.303 --> 19:16.459
Do you like me more than Zoey?

19:17.925 --> 19:20.315
I am really sorry you had
to find out like this.

19:23.165 --> 19:25.721
Isn't this awesome?
I... This is the first time

19:25.746 --> 19:28.096
we've been able to really
communicate with him in months.

19:29.573 --> 19:31.292
<i>I can't wait to show Mom.</i>

19:43.547 --> 19:45.480
- Hey.
- Looks good.

19:47.528 --> 19:49.128
Hey, Zo...

19:54.412 --> 19:56.256
Will you tell me the truth?

19:56.281 --> 19:58.560
Why didn't you want
to go to dinner with me?

19:58.818 --> 20:00.496
- What are you talking about?
- Don't do that.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.385
You tried to set me up with our barista.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.707
Ever since I mentioned Hand-Picked,

20:03.731 --> 20:06.310
it's like you haven't been into it.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.912
I have a lot going on, Max.

20:07.937 --> 20:10.082
I know, I know, but, you know,
something just feels

20:10.107 --> 20:12.581
a little bit different
between us all of a sudden.

20:13.056 --> 20:15.143
Is this because of your new power?

20:17.679 --> 20:20.331
Um, come here for a second.

20:20.966 --> 20:22.277
Okay.

20:22.302 --> 20:23.946
- My new power?
- Yes.

20:23.971 --> 20:26.448
Your new power over me as my boss.

20:26.473 --> 20:27.851
Is that what this is about?

20:27.876 --> 20:30.846
Yes, that is exactly...

20:31.321 --> 20:32.960
- ... what this is about.
- Okay.

20:32.985 --> 20:34.456
As your boss, I feel it's necessary

20:34.481 --> 20:35.863
to create some boundaries
between the two of us,

20:35.887 --> 20:39.448
and I guess I-I don't think
it's quite appropriate for us

20:39.473 --> 20:41.385
to be dining at fancy foodie
restaurants right now.

20:41.409 --> 20:42.886
And what's the fear, exactly?

20:42.911 --> 20:45.175
That we eat some pickled
beets out of a Mason jar

20:45.200 --> 20:46.823
and I end up with stock options?

20:46.848 --> 20:48.176
This is all new to me,
and I'm figuring it out

20:48.200 --> 20:50.323
- as I go, so please respect that.
- Okay,

20:50.348 --> 20:52.993
but I just think that you're
seriously overreacting.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.831
Everyone knows we're friends.
We've been friends

20:54.855 --> 20:56.901
since the day we met
at company orientation.

20:56.926 --> 20:59.104
You becoming team manager
shouldn't change any of that.

20:59.129 --> 21:01.998
And, yet, it does.
It changes everything, Max,

21:02.023 --> 21:04.535
because, when people look at us,
they don't see two friends.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.159
They see a boss and an employee

21:07.184 --> 21:09.909
who look like they're
in the middle of a...

21:10.238 --> 21:12.096
lovers' quarrel.

21:14.719 --> 21:16.510
I'm pretty sure nobody cares,

21:16.535 --> 21:20.206
but if you need to create some
boundaries between us, fine.

21:20.231 --> 21:22.177
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I should go back to work

21:22.201 --> 21:24.635
before my boss starts
yelling at me again.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.010
Anything?

21:30.034 --> 21:31.546
Oh, God.

21:32.144 --> 21:34.247
What about, um, this?

21:34.272 --> 21:36.849
What is going on, you crazy kids?

21:36.874 --> 21:38.053
I leave you alone for two minutes.

21:38.077 --> 21:39.872
Oh, I can't even joke about this.

21:39.897 --> 21:43.177
Your father has been trying to
tell me something all afternoon,

21:43.202 --> 21:44.802
and I don't know what it is.

21:44.827 --> 21:47.233
Mitch, is it like...

21:48.265 --> 21:50.276
I've taken everything
out of the cupboards,

21:50.301 --> 21:51.919
everything out of the fridge.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.013
I've gone through eight
different photo albums.

21:54.038 --> 21:55.701
I even tried on that old hula skirt

21:55.726 --> 21:58.380
when I thought maybe Hawaii
was leading us somewhere.

21:58.405 --> 22:01.802
Nothing. Apparently it's a lot harder

22:01.827 --> 22:04.802
to communicate with yes-no
answers than we thought.

22:04.827 --> 22:06.630
That must be really frustrating.

22:09.285 --> 22:10.771
It is.

22:10.796 --> 22:13.708
But on the bright side,
the hula skirt still fits.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.294
You know what? I'm
gonna clean all this up.

22:16.319 --> 22:17.568
Why don't you talk to him?

22:17.593 --> 22:20.036
Maybe you can have
better luck than I did.

22:27.959 --> 22:29.490
Hey, Dad.

22:29.750 --> 22:32.864
Any desire to tell me
what this is all about?

22:34.369 --> 22:35.746
Take your time.

22:37.507 --> 22:39.599
While you gather your thoughts,
I'm just gonna vent.

22:40.709 --> 22:42.435
I'm fighting with Max.

22:42.460 --> 22:45.896
I don't know how I'm supposed
to be his boss while also...

expressed through song?

24:15.800 --> 24:17.811
Well...

24:17.975 --> 24:22.224
I just heard you sing a song to Mom

24:22.249 --> 24:23.536
that I've never heard before,

24:23.561 --> 24:28.880
but it definitely had the word
"moon" in it multiple times.

24:29.611 --> 24:32.332
Does what you want to say to Mom
have something to do with that song?

24:36.015 --> 24:38.263
Good. We're getting somewhere.

24:38.842 --> 24:41.896
Now, why the moon song, Dad?

24:43.457 --> 24:45.513
Right. Not yes or no.

24:46.674 --> 24:48.904
Okay, don't despair.

24:48.929 --> 24:51.797
I'm gonna go do some research
on this and get back to you.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.122
Thank you for getting those.

24:56.147 --> 24:57.490
Oh, I just wasn't in the mood

24:57.515 --> 24:59.576
for another over-the-top
song-and-dance number

24:59.601 --> 25:01.980
by lonely, overcaffeinated people again.

25:02.005 --> 25:03.529
Huh. Understood.

25:03.554 --> 25:05.380
Having to witness
amazing private concerts

25:05.405 --> 25:07.857
throughout the day must
be incredibly tedious.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.810
My heart breaks for you.

25:10.225 --> 25:12.122
So, since we really want

25:12.147 --> 25:14.427
figure this thing out,
I have some new ideas.

25:14.452 --> 25:16.686
Seems to me, since you're
hearing people's inner thoughts,

25:16.710 --> 25:18.537
we need to go where their
inner thoughts are the loudest.

25:18.561 --> 25:19.966
I got bigger fish to fry right now,

25:19.991 --> 25:24.872
like trying to figure out why
my father sang "Moondance"

25:24.897 --> 25:26.452
to my mother in front of me last night.

25:26.476 --> 25:27.600
You don't know that song, do you?

25:27.624 --> 25:28.625
Of course I know that song.

25:28.649 --> 25:30.084
It's a very famous song.
Do you know that song?

25:30.108 --> 25:32.520
- Not until last night.
- Oh, Jesus, take the wheel.

25:33.077 --> 25:34.318
I've been racking my brain,

25:34.343 --> 25:37.099
trying to figure out why that song,

25:37.124 --> 25:39.168
and after going home
and googling the lyrics,

25:39.193 --> 25:40.193
I think that maybe...

25:40.218 --> 25:41.319
Your daddy wants to get
it on with your mama.

25:41.343 --> 25:42.474
- Does he, though?
- Mm.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.097
That's not open to interpretation?

25:44.122 --> 25:46.122
"Well, I want to make
love to you tonight.

25:46.147 --> 25:47.810
I can't wait till the morning has come."

25:47.835 --> 25:48.873
It doesn't get more clear than that.

25:48.897 --> 25:51.544
We didn't quite get to
that verse when he sang it.

25:51.819 --> 25:54.372
Fine. Guess I have no choice,

25:54.397 --> 25:56.919
but to talk to my mom
about my parents' sex life.

25:56.944 --> 25:58.552
Mm, with great power

25:58.577 --> 26:00.896
comes a whole lot of nasty
stuff don't nobody want to do.

26:00.921 --> 26:01.921
Hi, Daddy.

26:13.470 --> 26:15.355
I don't get it, guys.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.865
I told you to establish a model

26:17.890 --> 26:20.177
for how fast each leg of
the scavenger hunt will go.

26:20.202 --> 26:21.513
I gave you all the parameters.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.998
I told you I'd be
checking your progress.

26:23.022 --> 26:27.044
The project needs to be
done by tomorrow morning.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.123
I couldn't have been clearer,
so can somebody tell me

26:29.147 --> 26:32.177
why isn't the work getting
done and getting done properly?

26:32.202 --> 26:33.491
Maybe we're just not used to someone

26:33.515 --> 26:35.583
standing over our shoulder
every five minutes.

26:35.608 --> 26:37.553
He's right.
I haven't felt this kind of stress

26:37.578 --> 26:39.536
since I got into both MIT and Harvard.

26:39.561 --> 26:41.639
"What are you gonna do, Tobin?
What are you gonna do?"

26:41.663 --> 26:43.809
Hack into the CIA and go to
prison for three years instead.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.044
- What?
- I think I need to sit down.

26:46.069 --> 26:48.414
- My sciatic is acting up.
- Now?

26:48.439 --> 26:50.982
You've been at a
standing desk for years.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.654
Are these actual complaints,

26:52.679 --> 26:54.545
or are you guys just messing with me?

26:56.684 --> 26:59.083
Okay, forget about it.

26:59.203 --> 27:02.716
It was my idea. I have the vision.

27:02.741 --> 27:06.794
I'll just do the entire project myself.

27:28.366 --> 27:29.409
Wait.

27:30.286 --> 27:32.177
What am I doing wrong?

27:32.202 --> 27:34.147
Am I being too hard on everybody?

27:34.172 --> 27:35.816
I don't know. I'm just following orders

27:35.841 --> 27:37.286
and trying my best to please you.

27:37.311 --> 27:38.318
Right.

27:38.343 --> 27:40.544
I'll text you some pictures
of the food at Hand-Picked,

27:40.569 --> 27:43.708
unless you think that's
crossing another boundary.

27:43.885 --> 27:46.021
No, that would be nice.

27:46.046 --> 27:48.521
Well, um, I hope you and your work

27:48.546 --> 27:50.579
have a lovely evening together.

28:07.933 --> 28:09.232
Are you all right?

28:10.141 --> 28:12.707
Yeah. Hi. What's going on?

28:12.732 --> 28:14.334
Well, everyone's waiting
in the conference room

28:14.358 --> 28:15.872
to see our final presentation.

28:15.897 --> 28:18.060
Should we do it later, or...

28:18.085 --> 28:19.847
Oh, no, uh-uh.

28:20.013 --> 28:22.240
I finished it. Let's do this.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.365
Wait. Oh, wait. You have a little...

28:26.314 --> 28:27.822
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.076 --> 28:29.646
Okay.

28:29.671 --> 28:31.726
I'm not not mortified right now.

28:31.751 --> 28:32.861
Don't worry.

28:37.456 --> 28:40.535
And once all the influencers
are grouped together,

28:40.560 --> 28:42.956
the last clue will lead them all here

28:42.981 --> 28:46.259
to our offices for one
big rocking shindig.

28:46.284 --> 28:50.646
This is a seamless integration
of Simon's marketing department

28:50.670 --> 28:54.177
and my... well, our engineering skills.

28:54.202 --> 28:57.014
Yes, team, we've done it again.

28:57.039 --> 29:00.931
Go Sprq Point and Sprq
Point and Sprq Point!

29:00.956 --> 29:02.489
Whoo!

29:03.585 --> 29:05.404
Hey, Zoey, um...

29:06.367 --> 29:09.240
good work on the app,
but what is going on?

29:09.265 --> 29:11.311
Your hair is a mess,
and you're wearing leftover clothes

29:11.335 --> 29:12.741
from the company volleyball tournament.

29:12.765 --> 29:14.510
That presentation was
like a talk of shame.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.237
Oh, wow, that is not good at all.

29:16.262 --> 29:18.068
- No.
- But, still, are we only

29:18.093 --> 29:20.116
talking about my appearance?
'Cause if I was a guy...

29:20.140 --> 29:23.216
No, no, you smell bad, too.
Listen, as talented as you are,

29:23.241 --> 29:25.474
you can't take on these
projects all by yourself.

29:25.499 --> 29:27.715
It's unsustainable,
so go home, get some rest,

29:27.740 --> 29:29.585
and, remember,
the swag is for the interns.

29:29.609 --> 29:31.530
It keeps them happy so we
don't have to pay them.

29:38.923 --> 29:40.716
Please tell me your
day was better than mine

29:40.741 --> 29:44.555
and you finally solved the case
of the mystery Taboo buzzer.

29:46.384 --> 29:48.126
Sadly, no.

29:48.294 --> 29:51.700
I thought for a moment we got
back a tiny bit of control

29:51.725 --> 29:53.975
over this thing, and then...

29:54.549 --> 29:59.674
Is it possible that nonverbal
communication was almost easier?

29:59.699 --> 30:02.713
You really don't know what he wants

30:02.738 --> 30:04.190
or what he's trying to say?

30:04.215 --> 30:05.362
No.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.377
Okay. Okay.

30:07.402 --> 30:11.846
Well, um, I am just spitballing here,

30:11.871 --> 30:13.510
but have you ever thought that maybe,

30:13.535 --> 30:16.221
just maybe...

30:16.246 --> 30:19.247
he wants to have...

30:20.237 --> 30:21.659
sex with you?

30:23.854 --> 30:27.074
Sweetheart, it is very kind of you

30:27.099 --> 30:28.917
to be worried about our love life,

30:28.942 --> 30:30.753
but we're doing just
fine in that department,

30:30.778 --> 30:32.289
thank you very much.

30:32.436 --> 30:33.602
You are?

30:37.867 --> 30:40.331
Do you know the song "Moondance"?

30:43.109 --> 30:45.053
Yes. Why?

30:45.124 --> 30:49.229
Because I was just watching a
show with Dad the other day,

30:49.254 --> 30:51.900
and his face lit up
when that song came on,

30:51.925 --> 30:54.260
and he kept pressing the
buzzer over and over again,

30:54.285 --> 30:56.870
almost like he wanted to
sing along or something.

31:02.929 --> 31:06.364
Uh, when we were dating...

31:07.832 --> 31:12.001
your dad and I went to
a Van Morrison concert.

31:12.613 --> 31:14.288
Do you know who that is?

31:14.313 --> 31:17.127
Um, yes. I have recently

31:17.152 --> 31:19.885
become quite acquainted
with his body of work.

31:20.897 --> 31:22.429
Sorry.

31:23.549 --> 31:28.901
And, in the middle of that exact song,

31:28.926 --> 31:30.807
your dad turned to me

31:30.832 --> 31:33.393
and gave me the biggest kiss

31:33.418 --> 31:37.765
and said, "I love you,"
for the very first time.

31:37.790 --> 31:42.226
Mom, then maybe that's
what he's trying to say...

31:44.087 --> 31:45.998
that he loves you.

31:47.527 --> 31:52.276
And he wishes he could go
back to that night with you.

31:57.473 --> 31:59.206
Are you expecting somebody?

32:00.636 --> 32:01.735
Mm-mm.

32:02.965 --> 32:05.463
Max. What are you doing here?

32:05.488 --> 32:08.467
Oh, I was just dropping
this off for your dad.

32:08.492 --> 32:10.236
I didn't think you'd be here.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.806
After the all-nighter
you pulled last night,

32:11.830 --> 32:15.410
I thought that you'd be
at your place sleeping.

32:15.435 --> 32:17.980
Mm, I power napped,
and then I had to talk

32:18.005 --> 32:20.042
to my mom about my parents' sex life.

32:21.143 --> 32:22.224
What's in the bag?

32:22.248 --> 32:24.025
Oh, Hand-Picked has this

32:24.049 --> 32:26.448
incredible butterscotch pudding, and...

32:26.555 --> 32:29.448
I remember you saying that your dad
can only swallow soft food,

32:29.473 --> 32:32.266
so I thought maybe
he'd want to try some.

32:32.291 --> 32:34.784
That's really nice of you.

32:36.844 --> 32:38.444
Uh, come on in.

32:43.288 --> 32:46.701
Yeah, well, your dad's
always been so nice to me,

32:46.726 --> 32:48.203
letting me crash holiday dinners

32:48.228 --> 32:51.474
and birthdays and
barbecues in the summer.

32:51.777 --> 32:53.630
And you know I don't
have that same dynamic

32:53.655 --> 32:55.825
with my own dad, so...

32:56.302 --> 32:57.902
it's always meant a lot.

33:00.498 --> 33:03.077
It was really hard not
asking you to stay at work

33:03.102 --> 33:04.465
and help me last night.

33:05.099 --> 33:07.114
Yeah, it was really hard

33:07.139 --> 33:09.439
to see you all alone and not stay.

33:11.834 --> 33:13.066
Here.

33:15.347 --> 33:16.891
And Hand-Picked was?

33:16.916 --> 33:18.310
Was fantastic. Yeah.

33:18.335 --> 33:19.942
You really missed out.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.316
And how was Autumn?

33:22.864 --> 33:24.708
She was also good.

33:28.167 --> 33:30.445
I know I didn't handle
the work thing well.

33:30.950 --> 33:34.602
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

33:36.069 --> 33:39.356
Oh, um, do you want to see him?

33:40.513 --> 33:42.304
Can I?

33:42.328 --> 33:43.583
Yeah, of course.

33:43.608 --> 33:46.364
Um, just prepare yourself,

33:46.389 --> 33:48.834
'cause it's been a few months,

33:48.859 --> 33:51.559
and he might not be exactly
how you remember him.

33:52.950 --> 33:54.515
Okay.

33:56.483 --> 33:59.350
Dad, Max is here.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.310
Hey, Mitch.

34:07.726 --> 34:09.192
How you doing?

34:11.534 --> 34:13.880
I see you're in your favorite chair.

34:14.942 --> 34:16.786
That hasn't changed.

34:17.183 --> 34:19.668
Remember when I spilled
soda all over this chair

34:19.694 --> 34:22.438
and Maggie got so mad and
you didn't care at all?

34:27.746 --> 34:29.371
It's good to see you.

34:30.899 --> 34:33.091
I'll call you later. Okay.

34:33.828 --> 34:35.237
And she's back.

34:35.263 --> 34:37.520
Do I need to hide all of my breakables?

34:37.545 --> 34:39.636
Nah, I think you're safe.

34:39.661 --> 34:43.442
This QB is hanging up his jersey.

34:43.543 --> 34:46.106
Um, can I ask you something?

34:47.069 --> 34:49.522
You manage a whole team
of people just like me, right?

34:49.547 --> 34:50.547
Yeah.

34:50.746 --> 34:53.639
How are you out of
here at 6:00 every night?

34:53.664 --> 34:55.208
'Cause I've read a bunch of books...

34:55.234 --> 34:57.868
I-I never did any of that.

34:59.149 --> 35:01.598
It's actually something
my pops taught me.

35:01.623 --> 35:03.147
Oh. Well, then, we don't have...

35:03.172 --> 35:04.871
No, no, it's a good story.

35:09.829 --> 35:11.076
So, growing up,

35:11.415 --> 35:15.287
my dad owned a small chain
of electronic stores in Michigan.

35:15.312 --> 35:19.625
Uh, had a lot of stress,
lots of employees,

35:19.826 --> 35:23.840
but every Friday was "Let's eat" day.

35:23.865 --> 35:27.897
He'd make a giant vat of chili
or cinnamon rolls or spaghetti

35:27.922 --> 35:32.209
and go from location to
location and serve everyone.

35:32.928 --> 35:36.050
It's just a small personal
touch he'd bring to the table...

35:36.884 --> 35:39.084
just to let everyone know
he cared about 'em.

35:40.748 --> 35:43.295
And that one thing made everyone

35:43.320 --> 35:45.865
want to work that much harder for him.

35:47.278 --> 35:48.922
I...

35:49.764 --> 35:50.934
... can't cook.

35:50.959 --> 35:52.179
You should see the inside of my fridge.

35:52.203 --> 35:55.079
Just mustard and baking soda
and several science experiments

35:55.104 --> 35:56.782
growing out of an old chow mein.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.623
Then, find another way to let
them know you care about them.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.042
But what if I don't?

36:02.718 --> 36:04.121
Is that really true?

36:04.819 --> 36:07.030
There's nothing good about those guys?

36:12.982 --> 36:14.699
I want to read you all something.

36:14.724 --> 36:16.616
If it's from "Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants,"

36:16.640 --> 36:18.608
please don't spoil the ending.

36:18.633 --> 36:22.380
It's, uh, my journal

36:22.405 --> 36:26.467
that I've kept since my
first day on the job.

36:26.979 --> 36:29.280
Thought maybe you'd like to hear

36:29.305 --> 36:32.172
my initial impressions of everyone.

36:33.482 --> 36:39.686
"Wow, I can't believe I
get to work at Sprq Point

36:39.711 --> 36:41.756
"with all these incredibly smart,

36:41.781 --> 36:43.826
"talented, and impressive men.

36:43.851 --> 36:45.740
"Please don't say anything stupid.

36:48.061 --> 36:49.364
Andy Howard is..."

36:49.389 --> 36:51.301
Oh, wait. He works at Google now.

36:51.326 --> 36:52.342
Sorry.

36:52.367 --> 36:54.842
"Chin Wu..." Got fired.

36:55.287 --> 36:57.951
"JP Feakins..." He had
a nervous breakdown.

36:57.976 --> 36:59.530
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:59.555 --> 37:01.014
Here's one. Um...

37:01.039 --> 37:03.781
"Has there ever been a bigger
genius than Leif Donnelly?

37:05.469 --> 37:07.319
"I'm intimated to even
be in the same room

37:07.344 --> 37:09.353
as him and his dope cardigans."

37:09.378 --> 37:11.451
Yeah, hey.

37:11.476 --> 37:13.848
"And Tobin Batra?

37:13.873 --> 37:16.600
"This dude's a legend in
the hacking community,

37:16.625 --> 37:19.592
"and now he actually knows my name?

37:19.923 --> 37:21.890
"I think I might be dreaming.

37:25.904 --> 37:27.436
"And Max Richman.

37:29.502 --> 37:32.269
Is it too early to say,
'Friend for life?'"

37:36.105 --> 37:40.183
Look, I know not everyone is thrilled

37:40.208 --> 37:44.388
to have me as their boss,
but believe me when I say

37:44.413 --> 37:46.725
I know how good you are at your jobs,

37:47.326 --> 37:51.563
so I'm gonna try to let
go and trust you more,

37:52.545 --> 37:56.223
and, in return, all I ask
is that you trust me back.

37:57.369 --> 37:59.003
Understood?

37:59.028 --> 38:00.223
- Yeah.
- Yep.

38:00.248 --> 38:01.863
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

38:03.323 --> 38:05.996

right past the whole knocking

39:52.974 --> 39:54.820
and waiting for the other
person to answer phase.

39:54.844 --> 39:57.422
When I get inspired,
no doors will stand in my way.

39:57.447 --> 39:59.492
Now, I got a whole bunch of new ideas

39:59.517 --> 40:01.738
for us to try to test
your musical powers.

40:02.482 --> 40:05.995
First one, sensory deprivation tank.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.465
"I can't see anything.
I can't hear anything.

40:08.490 --> 40:11.260
But is there music?
I don't know. Let's find out."

40:11.285 --> 40:15.066
Number two, we put you in a room
with a whole bunch of mimes.

40:15.091 --> 40:17.629
My worst nightmare may be
your musical breakthrough.

40:17.654 --> 40:19.027
Creative.

40:19.052 --> 40:20.530
Absolutely terrifying.

40:20.555 --> 40:22.066
Oh, praise God. Hoo!

40:22.091 --> 40:24.434
Number three, we go to karaoke,

40:24.459 --> 40:26.715
see if people sing you their inner song

40:26.740 --> 40:29.301
at the same time they sing
the crowd their outer songs.

40:29.326 --> 40:31.504
Eh, could be cool. Could be confusing.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.073
Could be both. Let's see.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.744
Look, we can keep looking for ways

40:35.769 --> 40:37.980
to control my new ability.

40:39.716 --> 40:42.261
But what if there are no ways?

40:42.286 --> 40:43.716
- I don't like that attitude.
- Nope.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.485
Listen, it has happened enough times

40:45.510 --> 40:48.191
that we have actual
research and data now.

40:48.216 --> 40:51.019
Some songs go by in a blip,
as if no time has elapsed.

40:51.044 --> 40:53.877
Other songs, I'm able
to talk to you the entire time.

40:53.902 --> 40:56.414
Some songs are sung to
me by complete strangers,

40:56.438 --> 40:58.842
others by my closest friends and family.

40:58.867 --> 41:02.069
Songs never happen
when I want them to...

41:03.168 --> 41:05.920
only when I'm meant to hear them.

41:05.945 --> 41:07.553
Then, what do we do about it?

41:08.945 --> 41:11.889
As a kid who took apart
my parents' broken VCR

41:11.914 --> 41:13.865
and put it back
together when I was five,

41:13.890 --> 41:15.779
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

41:16.664 --> 41:18.041
nothing?

41:18.248 --> 41:20.044
I think I'm just gonna have to live

41:20.069 --> 41:23.865
with my new musical
power for a bit and...

41:24.813 --> 41:26.744
see what the universe brings.

41:27.107 --> 41:28.405
Did I really just say that out loud?

41:28.429 --> 41:30.904
Yeah, you did,
and I'm kind of obsessed with you

41:30.929 --> 41:32.963
and inspired to paint right now. Mm.

41:35.984 --> 41:39.076
Silver lining in all of this,
at least it's got us talking

41:39.101 --> 41:41.654
and invading each
other's personal spaces.

41:41.679 --> 41:43.694
Door's always open, honey.

41:44.178 --> 41:46.576
Unless I have a gentlemen caller over,

41:46.601 --> 41:49.302
so if you hear Sade playing,
I'd keep my distance.

41:50.201 --> 41:52.397
You do know who Sade is, right?

41:53.283 --> 41:54.670
Mm-hmm.

42:06.179 --> 42:08.585
♪ I got the music in me ♪

42:08.610 --> 42:12.012
