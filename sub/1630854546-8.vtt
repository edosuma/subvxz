higher conductivity

metallic features especially.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.161
What do you think those are,
Tom?

03:20.242 --> 03:21.742
-I don’t know.
-MARTY: Hmm.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.788
So, we need a swamp excavator
to find out.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.293
(laughter)

03:26.415 --> 03:29.755
You know, this could be
the Jack Adams box.

03:29.835 --> 03:32.095
-TOM: The box.
-RICK: Jack approached
your father

03:32.170 --> 03:35.420
-and said, "Hey,
I’ve got a metal target."
-TOM: Yes.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.469
Whatever that man found
is in that swamp.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.802
And maybe that’s it.

03:40.137 --> 03:44.967
<i>NARRATOR:
In the 1930s,
island caretaker Jack Adams</i>

03:45.100 --> 03:48.940
<i>probed the swamp and struck what
he described as a "mystery box."</i>

03:49.020 --> 03:53.480
<i>Unfortunately, he was unable
to determine just what it was.</i>

03:53.608 --> 03:56.438
<i>But later in 1969,</i>

03:56.570 --> 03:58.280
<i>after hearing
Mr. Adams’ story,</i>

03:58.363 --> 04:01.953
<i>Tom Nolan’s late father, Fred,
drained the swamp</i>

04:02.075 --> 04:03.575
<i>in order to look for it.</i>

04:03.660 --> 04:08.250
<i>The box was never found,
but Fred was astonished</i>

04:08.331 --> 04:11.171
<i>to discover numerous parts
of a large sailing vessel,</i>

04:11.293 --> 04:14.303
<i>as well as survey stakes
that were dated to as much</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:18.091
<i>as three centuries prior to
the discovery of the Money Pit.</i>

04:18.175 --> 04:21.265
<i>This made Fred speculate
that the swamp</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:23.354
<i>may have been
artificially created</i>

04:23.472 --> 04:27.522
<i>in order to hide the wreck of
a ship and its valuable cargo.</i>

04:27.642 --> 04:30.942
<i>Is it possible that
Jeremy Church has found</i>

04:31.021 --> 04:34.611
<i>more evidence that
this theory could be true?</i>

04:35.358 --> 04:37.688
I truly believe in that story.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.319
So, one of those
could be that box.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.528
Would a metal box
give you that anomaly?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.329
-For sure, yeah.
-MARTY: Well,
that’s interesting.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.044
Real interesting.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.924
Yeah.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.879
You’ve got the small hot spots
there, and then around them,

04:53.001 --> 04:55.341
there’s a large area
that’s orange.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.302
-What is that?
-I think that’s a good question.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.010
So, within here you’ve got
a deeper body of water

05:01.092 --> 05:03.222
causing that slightly elevated
conductivity.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.685
But as you come northwards here,

05:05.764 --> 05:07.604
the conductivity levels
are much lower.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.852
So, another anomaly
that I was very interested in

05:10.977 --> 05:13.227
was this one in the northern tip
of the swamp.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.692
You see all this blue,
and there’s this nice little,

05:16.775 --> 05:19.405
circular, moderately high
conductivity feature.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.568
RICK:
That’s above the eye.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.195
MARTY:
Is that the eye?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.122
Yeah, that’s awfully close
to the Eye of the Swamp.

<i>NARRATOR: Three years ago,

05:55.272 --> 05:58.272
<i>that something metallic,

05:58.400 --> 05:59.860
<i>could be buried much deeper</i>

<i>at the so-called

06:02.904 --> 06:05.744
CRAIG:
Yeah, if the Eye of the Swamp
may be indicating

06:05.866 --> 06:07.656
it has more depth to it

06:07.742 --> 06:09.622

right at the surface,

-MARTY: All right.

-Yes, I would think.

there’s targets here, yes.

But I’d like to see
a little more processing

06:23.967 --> 06:26.797

and see which ones

06:26.928 --> 06:28.638
really jump out
as the highest priorities

06:28.763 --> 06:32.103

some sort of a wall system

09:56.763 --> 09:59.893
We seem like we have quite
an open space right here.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.234
<i>NARRATOR:

a sonar operation</i>

10:02.310 --> 10:06.230

10:15.448 --> 10:18.198
-Very large return.
-ALEX: Yeah.

10:18.326 --> 10:22.496
PAUL: And we have hard signals
to the east and the west of it.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.332
That material, whether it’s wood
or it’s actually

10:24.457 --> 10:25.577
disturbed material
that’s close by,

10:25.667 --> 10:27.167
it’s high intensity.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.923
-Yeah.
-PAUL: So that’s
what we’re seeing.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.923
It’s a well-defined, open area
to the north and south.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.835
-But it is, as you can see,
it’s very linear.
-STEVE: Yeah.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.927
And I see it goes
a lot farther than that

10:36.010 --> 10:38.350
-based on the data
in front of us.
-Yeah.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.599

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
STEVE:
That’s good sonar data.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.250
So, what we’ll do is we’ll
download it and process it.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.963
I’ll put it in CAD,
and then I can show the guys,

11:07.041 --> 11:09.041
-Rick and Marty, right?
-Sounds like a plan.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.459
<i>-ALEX: Okay.
-STEVE: All righty.
-SCOTT: All right.</i>

11:10.545 --> 11:12.135

11:20.221 --> 11:22.431
Yeah. Where we’re at here.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.165
TOM:
My dad did quite a bit of work
in this area

11:49.250 --> 11:52.420
and at one point, he thought
he had come across

11:52.503 --> 11:54.513
some sort of a structure

11:54.589 --> 11:57.219
that had something to do
with constructing this bog,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.550
if it was man-made.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.429
<i>NARRATOR:
It was in this area</i>

12:02.555 --> 12:04.555
<i>where, back in the 1970s,</i>

12:04.641 --> 12:06.931
<i>Tom’s father,
Fred Nolan,</i>

12:07.060 --> 12:09.020
<i>believed he found evidence</i>

12:09.103 --> 12:13.323
<i>that Oak Island may have once
been two separate land masses</i>

12:13.441 --> 12:17.821
<i>and were joined together by
an artificially-created swamp.</i>

12:17.946 --> 12:22.196
Do you believe there’s
any specific items here, or...

12:22.283 --> 12:25.543
I think what we might be
looking for here

12:25.620 --> 12:28.620
is some sort of
a-a log structure.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.458
-STEPHAN: Mm-hmm.
-TOM: There was some sort of
a damming system here.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.792
Good, then let’s set up a grid.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.419
Okay.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.844
<i>RICK:
Fred, unlike previous searchers,</i>

12:36.965 --> 12:40.225
<i>was focused on trying
to unravel the mystery.</i>

12:40.301 --> 12:43.471
Here and then we go down
a couple of feet.

12:43.554 --> 12:47.274
<i>RICK:
And because of his skill
and expertise as a surveyor,</i>

12:47.350 --> 12:52.520
<i>he brought a skill set that
no one had done in the past.</i>

12:52.647 --> 12:56.647
He thought there was
a log wall, a structure,

12:56.776 --> 12:59.816
that he inferred might
be associated with

12:59.946 --> 13:03.156
either letting water into
the swamp or out of the swamp...

13:03.283 --> 13:05.413
12 and a half.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.703
<i>...and I would love
nothing better to affirm that</i>

13:06.828 --> 13:07.998
<i>that is true.</i>

13:38.192 --> 13:41.242
Okay.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.242
Okay, good.
Let’s have a look at the data.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.494
Okay.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.990
So, we’re now in the 3D view.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.867
We do see some anomalies,

13:50.955 --> 13:53.535
especially here in the middle.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.536
TOM:
Perfect. We’re looking for
a log structure.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.458
-PETER: Yeah.
-That might be it.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.506
-STEPHAN: Yep.
-TOM: Pretty exciting.
-PETER: Yeah.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.630
It’s really cool
that we’re getting

14:02.717 --> 14:05.137
the GPR anomalies
in the area of interest,

14:05.219 --> 14:07.969
-kind of the middle
of the bog area.
-STEPHAN: Yeah.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.636
Which would be kind of
where the two--

14:09.724 --> 14:12.274
if there were two islands--
they would come together.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.563
Yeah.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.681
<i>before his own passing in 2020.</i>

16:18.686 --> 16:20.646
Because of Robert Young’s
kind offer,

16:20.730 --> 16:23.730
we were able to
actually visit his home,

16:23.858 --> 16:26.108
and we saw the artifacts
that he had recovered,

16:26.194 --> 16:27.654
and I think
we were all impressed, right?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.197
<i>We were.</i>

16:29.322 --> 16:32.872
Robert invested
a large portion of his life

what Lot 5 meant.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.456

16:55.056 --> 16:56.716
this is a really good day
for Oak Island.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.767
Not only putting the island
back together but being able

16:58.893 --> 17:01.563
to advance the search
with more puzzle pieces.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.936
Hopefully the ride will be
quite entertaining.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.615
Gary, I’m quite surprised
you’re still in that room.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.153

What the hell’s that doing
out here?

-It’s heavy, though, isn’t it?
It’s well made.
-Yup.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.046

anything we’ve pulled

19:37.134 --> 19:38.724

-No.
-(laughter)

40:06.112 --> 40:08.282
Oh, we might with this.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.454
That’s how...
that’s how confident I am

40:10.533 --> 40:12.953
that this is a very,
very old coin.

40:13.036 --> 40:16.656
Look, i-it’s a great find,
but the more items we find,

40:16.789 --> 40:18.919
the more story,
the more connective tissue.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.168
(laughter)

40:25.298 --> 40:27.428
There’s plenty of Lot 5.
Don’t worry about it.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.184
-Take care. See you.
-Bye.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.064
Cheers.

40:33.139 --> 40:36.679
Okay, well, I mean,
it’s all good news.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.689
-Yeah.
-Lot 5, Lot 7
are now turning up

40:38.811 --> 40:41.151
some really esoteric metals.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.480
-Yeah.
-And we need to find out why.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.488
So, there’s a lot of
work to do, but...

40:46.611 --> 40:48.111
you and I won’t do it in here,
right?

40:48.196 --> 40:50.606
So I think we should
go back out, find more.

40:50.698 --> 40:52.318
-Okay, mate.
-All right.

40:52.408 --> 40:53.738
<i>-RICK: Good luck.
-GARY: See you later, guys.</i>

40:53.826 --> 40:55.536

41:24.899 --> 41:26.819

-CHARLES: Oh! We got wood.
-TERRY: Whoa!

41:40.248 --> 41:41.668
It looks like
it might be a new shaft.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.039
-It changes the whole story.
-TERRY: Yeah.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.207
We could be looking at
the Money Pit.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.416
<i>STEPHAN:
There’s significant anomalies
in this area.</i>

41:47.547 --> 41:50.047
Wow. That is huge.
We need to dig.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.014
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.894
-That is sweet.
-Whoa.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.181
This is Roman.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.814
-Roman?
-No way.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.350
Definitely from 300 BC.

42:00.435 --> 42:01.735
Roman, baby.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.521
-(laughter)
-It’s remarkable.
