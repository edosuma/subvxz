00:38.271 --> 00:41.607
When I call your name,
step out and tell me your date of birth.

00:41.707 --> 00:45.645
You hear your name, you'll be moved to
another holding cell. From there, court.

00:58.422 --> 01:01.025
- Stand in line. Brendon Johnson.
- Yes, sir.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.060
Tahir Ibrahim Abdi.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.928
No papers.

01:06.896 --> 01:10.265
No. No other record sheet.

01:12.066 --> 01:16.105
Nigerian: Came in on a visa in 2008...

01:16.205 --> 01:18.402
and has overstayed his welcome.

01:22.074 --> 01:23.610
Okay.

01:29.747 --> 01:31.549
Sign here.

01:32.715 --> 01:34.584
Thank you, officer.

01:36.051 --> 01:37.887
And here.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.424
- Thank you.
- Sign here for your personal items.

01:44.090 --> 01:45.826
Thank you.

01:46.926 --> 01:50.863
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, you are just doing your job.

01:50.963 --> 01:53.366
No reason for me to be impolite.

01:54.166 --> 01:57.169
Now, the policeman
who did this to my face,

01:57.269 --> 02:00.372
- that's another story.
- You wanna make a complaint?

02:00.472 --> 02:02.707
You are funny. I like you.

02:02.807 --> 02:05.559
I don't like you. Now, get out of here.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.528
I can go?

02:08.027 --> 02:12.031
The charge was reduced to disorderly conduct
which is a civil offense, not a crime.

02:12.131 --> 02:15.634
ICE says, until you commit a crime,
you are not a deportation priority.

02:15.734 --> 02:18.270
- Thank you, officer.
- Okay, get out.

03:51.325 --> 03:53.994
No, no, no.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.439
Jerry. Jerry!

03:57.539 --> 03:59.295
- I had no choice, Tahir.
- What happened?

03:59.395 --> 04:01.310
- There was too many of 'em.
- What happened to my things?

04:01.410 --> 04:03.801
There used to be an understanding
between our kind. A code.

04:03.901 --> 04:05.535
- I watch your things, you watch mine.
- Not no more.

04:05.635 --> 04:08.246
- That's what we said.
- Well, I'm sorry, Tahir.

04:08.346 --> 04:11.440
- But there was loads of 'em.
- Alright.

04:15.075 --> 04:18.812
- Big fellas, too.
- Alright, alright. You're alright.

04:22.882 --> 04:24.484
Jerry...

04:25.184 --> 04:27.385
You are wearing my boots.

04:30.186 --> 04:33.223
- What?
- Those are my boots.

04:36.758 --> 04:39.128
Them make some good winter boots.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.227
I know.
That's what I said when I got them.

04:45.465 --> 04:47.766
They're my boots now, Tahir.

04:50.534 --> 04:52.737
They're my boots now.

05:35.310 --> 05:38.154
Come back again on Friday.
We would like to see you both.

05:42.082 --> 05:44.752
You come back for lunch anytime you want.

05:50.789 --> 05:54.064
Good to see you. Are you back?

05:54.164 --> 05:58.086
No. No, I just need some clothes
and bedding. My things were stolen.

05:58.186 --> 06:01.697
- How?
- I left the door to my penthouse open.

06:03.398 --> 06:05.900
Come inside. It's a thousand degrees.

06:12.338 --> 06:15.175
You don't wanna come back
into the program?

06:15.775 --> 06:19.145
No. Really, no. I just need
some clothes and bedding.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.981
Can't just give out the clothes, Tahir.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.750
Clothing pickup is on Thursday
between three and five.

06:24.850 --> 06:28.887
You're welcome to come back then.
And we don't give out bedding.

06:29.986 --> 06:33.957
- It's going to rain this evening.
- So why not stay here tonight?

06:38.827 --> 06:40.897
Come back, Tahir.

06:41.397 --> 06:43.462
I shouldn't be here.

06:43.562 --> 06:45.967
This is exactly where you should be.

10:11.663 --> 10:14.867
- Excuse me, can you spare a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.641
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:17.741 --> 10:21.138
Can I have another one? Please?

10:21.238 --> 10:22.806
Thanks.

10:37.918 --> 10:40.254
Excuse me, can you spare some change?

10:40.754 --> 10:43.456
Excuse me, can you spare some change?

10:44.056 --> 10:46.825
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Have a great day.

10:47.190 --> 10:51.928
Excuse me, can you spare a cigarette?
Thank you. Can I have one more?

10:52.028 --> 10:54.363
Excuse me, can you spare some change?

10:56.097 --> 10:59.167
Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.734
Excuse me.

11:02.834 --> 11:05.237
Excuse me, can you spare some change?

11:13.208 --> 11:15.144
Can you spare some change?

11:48.205 --> 11:49.941
Come on.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.023
Stop following me.

13:16.821 --> 13:19.290
What is your fucking problem?

13:19.390 --> 13:22.026
- That is my jacket.
- Your what?

13:22.126 --> 13:26.062
That's my jacket.
You got it back on Jerry's alley.

13:28.997 --> 13:32.501
- It's a hundred fucking degrees out.
- It is mine.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.837
You want your jacket? You just want your
jacket then you're gonna leave me alone?

13:35.937 --> 13:38.173
I just want what is mine.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.345
Here.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.079
Now, go!

13:48.746 --> 13:50.348
Go!

13:52.415 --> 13:54.785
Come off the bridge.

13:54.885 --> 13:57.294
I know why people come up here.

14:20.439 --> 14:23.510
I wanna go! I wanna go!

14:24.010 --> 14:26.479
I wanna go, please!

14:29.848 --> 14:32.718
I wanna go! I wanna go!

15:07.049 --> 15:09.286
Stay here for a minute.

15:22.797 --> 15:26.268
I made you a bed. At the end.

15:26.368 --> 15:28.570
On your own, you know?

16:21.269 --> 16:23.135
I'll sleep here.

17:30.286 --> 17:31.955
Good morning.

17:39.694 --> 17:42.298
Eat. There is nothing of you.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.870
What is your name?

19:15.182 --> 19:17.517
Alright, now hit the drum. Ready?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.754
Go!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.956
Come on.

19:25.056 --> 19:28.122
Left down. Go! Now you. Now you.

19:39.266 --> 19:41.068
Thank you.

19:41.634 --> 19:43.636
No, no. Thank you.

19:45.670 --> 19:47.973
No, no. Thank you. Lady, we have no money.

19:48.073 --> 19:50.542
- Then why'd you stay in this line?
- What?

19:50.642 --> 19:53.137
- Why didn't you stand in this line?
- Fuck you.

19:53.237 --> 19:56.906
- What's the problem?
- The vagrant wants money.

19:57.006 --> 20:01.920
That bitch! Perhaps...
she can suck my dick first.

20:05.019 --> 20:09.206
There's not enough money in the world
to make me touch your tiny cock.

20:09.774 --> 20:13.037
- You speak French?
- Yes, why not?

20:13.137 --> 20:16.604
Because I am on the streets?
Or because I am a stupid American?

20:16.704 --> 20:21.367
- No, we just didn't think you spoke French.
- Never judge a book by its cover.

20:23.628 --> 20:26.790
Listen, my boyfriend...

20:26.890 --> 20:29.772
he just returned
from a tour of duty in Iraq...

20:29.872 --> 20:33.257
and he gets a bit twitchy
when people are rude to me.

20:34.649 --> 20:38.570
Why not show him
how much you liked his music.

20:44.487 --> 20:46.135
Thank you.

20:46.806 --> 20:50.251
Goodbye... and welcome to America!

20:52.370 --> 20:54.457
What just happened?

20:55.170 --> 20:58.574
They just really liked your music
and didn't know how to express it.

22:20.352 --> 22:21.888
- You like movies?
- I do.

22:21.988 --> 22:26.631
- You do?
- You like... you like Robert DeNiro?

22:26.731 --> 22:29.360
- I do.
- You do?

22:29.460 --> 22:31.395
Okay, you ready?

22:36.963 --> 22:39.065
You talking to me?

22:48.606 --> 22:51.742
- What?
- I wanna ask you a question.

22:51.842 --> 22:53.510
Okay.

22:55.978 --> 22:58.181
Do you really believe?

22:59.181 --> 23:01.782
- Yes.
- Yes. I... Yes.

23:01.882 --> 23:04.201
But I mean...

23:04.819 --> 23:09.488
- do you really believe?
- With all my heart.

23:12.322 --> 23:14.090
Okay.

23:15.135 --> 23:18.895
- What?
- It seems a bit unwarranted, doesn't it?

23:18.995 --> 23:20.663
Why?

23:24.215 --> 23:26.250
Come on!

23:26.350 --> 23:28.022
What?

23:29.019 --> 23:31.215
- You're a hobo. You're a tramp.
- So?

23:31.315 --> 23:35.294
So he doesn't really seem to have
liked you very much, does he?

23:36.793 --> 23:38.609
The prophet said,

23:38.709 --> 23:43.899
I looked into paradise and the majority
of his dwellers were the poor.

23:44.099 --> 23:46.762
- So?
- So in heaven...

23:46.862 --> 23:49.526
the poor will have recompense.

23:51.021 --> 23:53.192
After you've died?

23:57.343 --> 23:59.981
That's convenient, isn't it?

24:01.113 --> 24:03.181
That's what you say.

24:03.281 --> 24:05.752
That's what you say!

24:07.117 --> 24:10.520
Besides, he blesses me all the time.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.484
How so?

25:19.084 --> 25:22.323
Hey! Buy something.

25:35.898 --> 25:39.034
I just... need a few days.
Can you give me a few days?

25:39.134 --> 25:40.935
A few days.

25:41.035 --> 25:44.471
I can't do that. I mean,
why would I do that?

25:44.571 --> 25:49.075
Cause I don't have it,
so I can't give it to you.

25:49.275 --> 25:52.511
- You got something.
- I got five fucking dollars.

25:52.611 --> 25:55.947
Look, you want it? You can have it.

25:56.047 --> 25:57.882
What am I gonna do with five dollars?

25:57.982 --> 26:00.985
So, give me a few days.

26:01.085 --> 26:03.757
Or you could be nice to me.

26:05.155 --> 26:06.656
- Tahir!
- Get him off me!

26:06.756 --> 26:08.924
- Stop!
- My nose!

26:09.024 --> 26:11.092
I owe him money.

26:11.292 --> 26:13.994
You shut up.
It doesn't matter how much you owe him.

26:14.094 --> 26:17.396
- Man, why you give a fuck?
- Because she is my woman.

26:17.496 --> 26:20.497
Yeah, for the right price.

26:21.897 --> 26:23.700
Fuck, man!

26:23.800 --> 26:27.463
My fucking face. Shit.

26:28.668 --> 26:31.838
- How much does she owe you?
- Half a bundle.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.574
- What is that?
- Fifty-dollars, you crazy motherfucker.

26:34.674 --> 26:40.273
Here, I have ten, twenty, thirty, forty.

26:40.545 --> 26:42.447
It's all the money I have in the world.

26:42.547 --> 26:47.669
If I ever see you near her again,
you'll see me again.

26:49.351 --> 26:51.887
Out your fucking mind, man.

26:51.987 --> 26:54.224
Not now.

28:14.585 --> 28:16.554
Do you feel remorse?

28:16.654 --> 28:18.522
I do.

28:18.722 --> 28:21.858
Do you resolve never
to commit the sin again?

28:21.958 --> 28:23.493
Yes.

28:24.393 --> 28:27.162
Have you made restitution for this sin?

28:27.262 --> 28:29.333
Made recompense?

28:29.963 --> 28:32.099
I can't.

28:33.566 --> 28:36.027
The man you beat up?

28:44.175 --> 28:49.113
Whatever the sin is, it is a private
matter between you and Allah.

28:49.213 --> 28:52.916
If repentance is sincere,
you need only ask.

28:53.016 --> 28:55.487
Allah, forgive me.

28:57.619 --> 28:59.454
He will forgive.

28:59.554 --> 29:03.624
I pray to repent, not for forgiveness.

29:03.724 --> 29:07.120
Allah forgives, Tahir.

29:07.660 --> 29:12.806
The objective is the be forgiven,
not to be judged and condemned,

29:12.906 --> 29:17.336
but you must make restitution.

29:17.436 --> 29:19.639
You must put it right.

29:33.983 --> 29:36.415
Did you get what you needed?

29:38.819 --> 29:40.455
You?

29:40.555 --> 29:43.425
No. Bad day.

29:44.172 --> 29:46.474
We'll be hungry tonight.

29:48.692 --> 29:51.329
What is it we are waiting for?

29:51.629 --> 29:54.110
For God to provide.

29:55.099 --> 29:56.737
What?

30:53.715 --> 30:55.152
We gotta go!

30:56.877 --> 30:59.999
Come on! Come on!

31:07.456 --> 31:09.494
Excuse me!

31:15.162 --> 31:17.201
Come on!

31:21.034 --> 31:23.139
Hurry, come on.

31:23.935 --> 31:26.307
This way. Come.

31:28.322 --> 31:29.727
Tahir.

31:35.044 --> 31:37.383
Go, go, go, go!

31:57.232 --> 31:59.270
Over here.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.305
Hey!

32:07.906 --> 32:09.944
Let's leave it.

32:10.774 --> 32:12.777
Someone's home.
That's why the door's open.

32:12.877 --> 32:16.446
Rich people are careless.
That's why it's open.

32:17.046 --> 32:18.784
Hannah.

32:20.682 --> 32:22.420
Hannah!

32:24.652 --> 32:26.024
Hannah!

32:35.963 --> 32:37.768
Hannah.

32:42.701 --> 32:44.914
Where are you, Hannah?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.612
Hannah!

32:57.513 --> 33:00.850
- It's not much, but its home.
- We need to leave now.

33:00.950 --> 33:03.685
- Why?
- It's someone house, Hannah.

33:03.785 --> 33:06.387
- But they're not using it right now.
- What?

33:06.487 --> 33:09.789
- They're at the beach.
- Put the drink down.

33:09.889 --> 33:12.557
Look, they have kids!
It's summer. They're rich.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.859
They're at the beach. The Hamptons.

33:14.959 --> 33:17.161
- Maybe even Europe somewhere.
- No, no!

33:17.261 --> 33:21.431
- Definitely at the beach.
- No, Hannah, we can't.

33:21.531 --> 33:25.134
Tahir, we need something good.

33:25.234 --> 33:27.569
This is something good.

33:27.669 --> 33:30.863
This is wrong. It's dangerous.

33:34.641 --> 33:36.813
I wanna kick.

33:38.544 --> 33:40.816
I could kick in this place.

34:02.433 --> 34:04.538
Found it.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.638
Gone 'til September.

34:07.738 --> 34:12.277
Okay, but we keep our bags
packed by the door.

34:14.676 --> 34:16.984
Have you done this before?

34:17.612 --> 34:19.414
What do I do?

34:19.514 --> 34:24.087
Not tonight. The night always wins.
Start tomorrow.

34:25.284 --> 34:27.378
Tonight we celebrate.

35:32.783 --> 35:35.019
So I am barefoot.

35:35.319 --> 35:37.854
The man's shoes didn't fit.

35:38.554 --> 35:41.060
I smell chicken. Did you find chicken?

35:50.263 --> 35:53.001
I feel unbelievably stupid suddenly.

35:55.666 --> 35:58.539
I must look like a zombie Goldilocks.

36:00.002 --> 36:02.772
This is where you should say something.

36:02.872 --> 36:05.107
Actu... actually, don't...
don't say anything.

36:05.207 --> 36:08.647
- I'm just gonna peel potatoes.
- I forgot how to speak for a second.

36:08.747 --> 36:11.757
You are more beautiful
than I have words for.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.703
Let's not go overboard.

36:23.554 --> 36:25.657
Why don't you set the table?

36:25.757 --> 36:28.562
I found placemats and everything in there.

36:31.711 --> 36:35.882
Just because something is hard to
comprehend doesn't mean it's not true.

36:36.732 --> 36:38.868
How old do you think the world is?

36:38.968 --> 36:41.803
About four and a half billion years old.

36:42.363 --> 36:45.476
Okay, good. So you're not a creationist.

36:46.606 --> 36:48.875
Have you ever been to Nigeria?

36:48.975 --> 36:53.513
I am from Lagos.
We have skyscrapers and a rail system.

36:53.613 --> 36:57.519
You picture me running
around in a loincloth?

36:59.049 --> 37:00.969
Okay, fine. So...

37:01.069 --> 37:06.524
We've established that you're not
a creationist and I am a borderline racist.

37:06.924 --> 37:08.625
How long has man been on earth?

37:08.725 --> 37:11.494
About a hundred and thirty thousand years.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.063
And God appeared when?

37:14.863 --> 37:17.565
To Abraham about four thousand years ago.

37:17.665 --> 37:20.601
So, for a hundred
and twenty six thousand years

37:20.701 --> 37:23.771
of uninterrupted squalor and disease,

37:23.871 --> 37:25.939
God was fine with it?

37:26.039 --> 37:28.951
He just sat on his hands
and then four thousand years ago

37:29.051 --> 37:31.510
decides to do something about it?

37:31.610 --> 37:34.144
I don't claim to understand.

37:34.944 --> 37:39.716
I know this, when I pray I am with Allah.

37:39.816 --> 37:41.684
He speaks to me alone.

37:41.784 --> 37:46.291
He talks... not to my mind,
but to my heart.

37:47.788 --> 37:50.008
What do you believe?

37:52.992 --> 37:55.195
Well, I believe I need another drink.

37:55.295 --> 37:58.031
No, I mean it. What do you believe?

37:58.131 --> 38:02.635
If there's nothing... if there is nothing
then how do you explain all of this?

38:02.735 --> 38:04.203
I can't comprehend it.

38:04.303 --> 38:08.794
Well, just because you can't comprehend
something doesn't mean it isn't true.

38:10.708 --> 38:13.744
Now you are just being clever.
Answer the question.

38:13.844 --> 38:18.048
I believe in the big bang.

38:18.748 --> 38:20.383
Okay.

38:21.483 --> 38:23.985
So who made the big bang?

38:24.085 --> 38:26.748
- Well, that's the problem.
- Yes.

38:26.848 --> 38:32.259
But I see no reason to solve it
with an even bigger problem.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.929
What do you mean?

38:36.029 --> 38:38.400
What made God?

38:39.430 --> 38:43.067
- Well, Allah is eternal.
- Hard to substantiate though, isn't it?

38:43.167 --> 38:45.265
Why can't we see God? Where does he live?

38:45.365 --> 38:49.874
And why does he turn otherwise good
people into murderers in his name?

38:52.940 --> 38:55.876
- You're funny.
- In what way?

38:55.976 --> 38:58.577
In a contradictory way.

38:59.177 --> 39:01.213
I'm not the first Muslim to drink.

39:01.313 --> 39:04.715
I'm not talking about a sneaky beer
before Ramadan. You properly drink.

39:04.815 --> 39:09.085
- You use this drug that harms you.
- You're talking about cognitive dissonance.

39:09.185 --> 39:11.721
Heroin dulls the pain,
but it'll probably kill me.

39:11.821 --> 39:15.594
But that assumes that I see dissonance
and not cognizance.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.703
I need to use the powder room.

40:07.267 --> 40:09.538
Are you tired?

40:15.038 --> 40:17.968
I'm not ready for tomorrow to come yet.

40:23.578 --> 40:26.006
Come to bed with me.

40:32.019 --> 40:34.729
I used to live in a place like this.

40:36.022 --> 40:38.727
I used to sleep in a bed like that.

40:40.224 --> 40:43.093
- I was married.
- It's alright, Hannah.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.531
I know it's fucking alright.

40:49.230 --> 40:54.403
He was a surgeon.
He enlisted in the reserves after 9/11.

40:55.603 --> 41:00.975
And then someone came to my house
and told me he was gone, just like that.

41:01.875 --> 41:05.471
The coffee in my hand
was still warm when he was gone.

41:06.944 --> 41:10.584
He was killed in terrorist attack
on a military checkpoint.

41:18.887 --> 41:21.983
I didn't know how to be
in the world without him.

41:24.325 --> 41:26.872
And now I've made such a mess.

41:29.429 --> 41:32.311
I don't know how to be
in the world at all.

41:36.802 --> 41:39.172
It'll be different this time.

41:39.272 --> 41:42.344
It'll be exactly the same this time.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.953
Hannah?

42:36.219 --> 42:39.391
- Hannah.
- Please, don't come in.

43:53.031 --> 43:57.329
This is bad. This is bad.
Something's wrong.

43:57.429 --> 43:59.297
I've done this before.
I'm telling you this.

43:59.397 --> 44:02.933
I'm telling you something is wrong.
You know people hemorrhage from this.

44:03.033 --> 44:08.137
You know you can have a fucking aneurysm
from this. My fucking head is dying here.

44:08.237 --> 44:10.439
You've come so far, Hannah.
We're nearly there.

44:10.539 --> 44:13.958
We are nowhere.
I'm the only person here in pain.

44:14.508 --> 44:17.444
Fuck this! I can do what I choose!
I choose out.

44:17.544 --> 44:21.247
- I choose out and you can fucking stop me.
- You're right, I can't stop you.

44:21.347 --> 44:25.845
- That's right! You can't stop me!
- You're right, I can't stop you.

44:29.853 --> 44:32.059
Sleep would help.

45:32.078 --> 45:36.168
I need to make some money.
Will you be alright on your own?

45:50.194 --> 45:52.630
- Excuse me. I was watching you play.
- Yes.

45:52.730 --> 45:55.832
You're... you're good.
I mean, it was really something.

45:55.932 --> 45:57.770
Thank you.

45:58.567 --> 46:00.238
My pleasure.

46:03.103 --> 46:05.106
What do you want?

46:07.176 --> 46:10.877
So I was talking to those...
those... guys over there

46:10.977 --> 46:15.547
and they said that
they'd seen you with her.

46:15.947 --> 46:19.083
This is my daughter, Hannah.

46:19.783 --> 46:22.277
Is this your... is that your girlfriend?

46:22.377 --> 46:25.353
I'm not with anyone.
I don't know your daughter. I'm sorry.

46:25.453 --> 46:28.355
This is really important to me.
Would you look again please, sir?

46:28.455 --> 46:31.614
Just... I'm sure she's changed.
It's an older picture, but...

46:31.714 --> 46:33.358
I would think you could recognize her.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.910
Please, just... would you
just please look at it again.

46:36.010 --> 46:40.256
I don't need to.
Those men just took your money.

46:48.703 --> 46:51.242
I'm sorry to bother you. I...

46:59.879 --> 47:03.649
No, no. You see, no, I'm sorry.
I don't buy it.

47:04.149 --> 47:07.485
I don't buy it. And I'll tell you why,
I've been out west.

47:07.585 --> 47:10.722
And I retired out there a few years ago.

47:10.822 --> 47:14.303
But every month for the past 3 and
a half years, I've been coming back here

47:14.403 --> 47:18.229
to look for my daughter, and I can't
tell you how many false leads I've got.

47:18.329 --> 47:20.926
You know, let's of people
lie to you to take your money,

47:21.026 --> 47:25.635
but nobody ever said that guy over there,
right over there, he knows your daughter.

47:25.735 --> 47:30.738
Because that would be a stupid lie, because
I'd go back and I'd come and get my money.

47:31.038 --> 47:33.544
I believe you do know her.

47:34.741 --> 47:37.213
So I'm gonna ask you a favor.

47:38.977 --> 47:42.284
Okay, this is Jake. This is Jake.

47:44.147 --> 47:46.586
He needs his mother.

47:48.550 --> 47:50.919
I'm sorry for your trouble.

47:51.019 --> 47:55.511
Really, I don't know her.

48:05.231 --> 48:09.170
If you concentrate hard enough
you can change the colors of the lights.

48:11.968 --> 48:15.772
That's not faith by the way,
it's willpower.

48:15.872 --> 48:19.678
You would say God can change the colors.
I'm saying we can.

48:20.508 --> 48:23.078
- Come on, try with me.
- No.

48:23.178 --> 48:25.867
- Didn't God tell us to try everything once?
- No, he didn't.

48:26.147 --> 48:30.373
- Why didn't he?
- Because some things are just wrong.

48:33.451 --> 48:38.299
So... he covered the earth in highly
addictive and highly yummy heroin,

48:38.399 --> 48:41.133
- but we're not supposed to use it.
- Right.

48:41.233 --> 48:45.294
- Despite it growing naturally on his earth.
- That's right.

48:46.035 --> 48:49.581
What a sneaky little prankster God is.

48:52.499 --> 48:55.636
- Are you concentrating?
- Stop now.

48:55.736 --> 48:57.685
- Shame on you.
- Excuse me.

48:57.785 --> 48:59.923
Shame on you.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.977
You have a child and he has nothing.

49:06.077 --> 49:08.613
No mother, no father, and for what?

49:08.713 --> 49:10.679
- Because you are broken?
- What are you doing?

49:10.779 --> 49:12.922
Look at the photograph. He is alone.

49:13.022 --> 49:17.019
You have never seen a boy
who looks more alone. Look at him!

49:17.119 --> 49:21.668
My grief is many things. It has made me
behave in ways that I regret

49:21.768 --> 49:23.790
and in ways
that I do not fully understand yet,

49:23.890 --> 49:27.193
but the one thing I know, it is
overwhelming my fucking business.

49:27.293 --> 49:31.787
Talk to me. Tell me,
how could you do this? Who are you?

49:31.887 --> 49:35.904
Who am I? I am a woman
with a murdered husband,

49:36.004 --> 49:39.135
a heroin addiction, and a child
that I haven't been a mother to.

49:39.235 --> 49:41.836
Who the fuck are you?

49:42.236 --> 49:46.363
You know everything about me.
You've left me with no shade,

49:46.463 --> 49:50.644
and meanwhile, I know not
one fucking thing about you.

49:50.744 --> 49:55.084
Not a thing. Who am I?
Who the fuck are you?

49:57.381 --> 50:01.423
- You don't want to know who I am.
- I think I do.

50:04.688 --> 50:08.564
I come from a place more violent
than you can imagine.

50:08.664 --> 50:10.293
Yes.

50:11.093 --> 50:14.630
I watched my wife
pulled from under our bed.

50:14.730 --> 50:20.168
Raped and murdered while I hid
in a cupboard with our son.

50:20.268 --> 50:24.071
The whole time she looked
at me and I looked at her.

50:24.171 --> 50:27.675
My hand still over my Ibrahim's mouth.

50:28.175 --> 50:31.087
After, we ran to the streets
to hide in a crowd,

50:31.187 --> 50:34.449
but in that crowd, a bullet chose my son.

50:37.048 --> 50:40.286
I'd give anything to be with him again.

50:41.086 --> 50:44.525
I'd give anything to see my boy again.

50:46.288 --> 50:49.295
That's why I don't understand you.

51:01.035 --> 51:04.108
- I'm sorry, Tahir.
- I'm not finished.

51:06.606 --> 51:08.331
Alright.

51:10.510 --> 51:13.215
At the funeral, a man came to me...

51:13.315 --> 51:17.845
and he said, Tahir,
Islam is a beautiful flower...

51:18.445 --> 51:21.490
but sometimes it needs thorns.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.426
The next day I joined Boko Haram.

51:27.256 --> 51:30.660
What... what is Boko Haram?

51:30.760 --> 51:34.767
I became a murderer of women and children.

51:37.164 --> 51:39.300
I burnt churches.

51:39.400 --> 51:44.671
I burnt schools, police stations,
military checkpoints.

51:44.771 --> 51:46.839
That's who I am.

51:46.939 --> 51:51.343
I watched people burn and for nothing.

51:51.443 --> 51:54.682
I watched people die like your husband.

51:56.196 --> 51:58.869
There is no peace in it, Hannah.

53:01.709 --> 53:03.781
Hannah, I'm sorry.

53:06.846 --> 53:08.851
Please no.

53:09.714 --> 53:11.425
Don't.

53:16.853 --> 53:20.293
You can get back to your life, Hannah.

53:21.623 --> 53:23.696
You can have it all back.

53:34.001 --> 53:36.240
Please don't.

55:26.742 --> 55:30.284
I recognize that I need
something different.

55:30.912 --> 55:33.350
I tried to disappear...

55:35.650 --> 55:38.417
but my son held me in life.

55:42.288 --> 55:44.961
What I did is unforgivable.

55:50.094 --> 55:52.520
Can you help me get back to him?

55:53.496 --> 55:55.758
Who are you?

57:17.743 --> 57:22.830
God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

57:22.930 --> 57:28.486
courage to change the things I can,
and wisdom to know the difference.

57:28.586 --> 57:31.288
- Alright, thanks for sharing everybody.
- Thank you.

57:31.388 --> 57:34.757
Now remember, this is your rooms, y'all.
Keep coming back.

57:34.857 --> 57:38.526
It works if you work it, right?

57:39.326 --> 57:42.796
Excuse me. Hey, Hun.
Where you running off to in such a hurry?

57:42.896 --> 57:45.622
...that extension.
I didn't wanna miss the meeting.

57:45.722 --> 57:48.133
But I gotta give it to the landlord
before he clocks off at 6.

57:48.233 --> 57:51.233
Otherwise we're gonna be out on our ear.
So I really gotta run.

57:51.333 --> 57:54.171
You run off, but I want you to think
about sharing sometime, okay?

57:54.271 --> 57:56.773
- Okay, I will. See ya!
- See ya. Thanks for coming.

57:56.873 --> 58:00.245
- Thanks, Franklin.
- Take care. Thanks for sharing, too.

58:19.624 --> 58:23.628
- How'd it go?
- She was incredibly nice.

58:23.728 --> 58:26.897
She gave us a ten day extension
while our case is reviewed.

58:26.997 --> 58:30.252
Which she reminded me
would be denied because

58:30.352 --> 58:33.792
you don't have your papers
and we're not married, but...

58:34.236 --> 58:37.806
with the storm coming, I don't know.

58:37.906 --> 58:40.093
She chose to be nice.

58:41.308 --> 58:45.434
She even let me sign for you
when I told her how sick you were.

58:45.777 --> 58:50.614
You should've seen Terry's face downstairs
when I handed him the extension letters.

58:51.014 --> 58:55.055
I thought he was gonna break his teeth,
he clenched his jaw so tight.

58:56.252 --> 58:58.355
How you feeling?

58:58.455 --> 59:00.826
A bit better I think.

59:01.991 --> 59:04.892
I'm gonna make you a bowl
of hot water in the steamer.

59:05.359 --> 59:07.495
So what are we going to do?
We need a plan.

59:07.595 --> 59:10.423
We have a plan. We're gonna get you well.

59:10.523 --> 59:13.633
And then I'm gonna find us
a place to move to in ten days time.

59:13.733 --> 59:17.302
And then in three weeks, I'll have finished
my internship and I can get a proper job.

59:17.402 --> 59:21.392
So if we cannot find a place in ten days,
I'll go to a men's shelter.

59:21.492 --> 59:23.875
- No, we stick together.
- And you will go to a woman's shelter.

59:23.975 --> 59:27.017
I just got us 10 days. Why you trying
to get rid of me before I've even tried?

59:27.117 --> 59:30.082
I just need to know you are safe.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.615
Geez.

59:35.615 --> 59:38.055
Like a grumpy old man.

59:44.990 --> 59:47.262
Come on, grumpy.

59:57.034 --> 59:59.473
Put your head down.

01:00:01.803 --> 01:00:03.906
How do you feel today?

01:00:04.006 --> 01:00:06.409
Did you make your meeting?

01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:09.878
I nearly missed though because
of the whole extension thing.

01:00:09.978 --> 01:00:13.380
- You can't afford to miss, Hannah.
- I didn't miss.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.181
I'll tell you what I can't afford.

01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:19.754
I can't afford to spend a winter in a
women's shelter around a bunch of addicts.

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:24.156
Maybe you are ready to go home.

01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:29.059
Would you come?

01:00:35.995 --> 01:00:38.391
I'm not ready yet.

01:00:40.365 --> 01:00:43.935
When I go home to him,
I want it to be for good this time.

01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:48.843
That's funny.

01:00:49.806 --> 01:00:52.643
Today I realized I can see the future.

01:00:53.243 --> 01:00:58.319
I don't mean in a paranormal way, just...

01:00:58.419 --> 01:01:01.393
I hadn't given it
much thought in a while...

01:01:01.743 --> 01:01:03.731
but then...

01:01:04.231 --> 01:01:08.806
today I was able to see
myself back with Jake.

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:14.895
And then I saw him a little older.

01:01:15.195 --> 01:01:18.368
He was walking down a street somewhere.

01:01:19.898 --> 01:01:21.834
He was holding hands with you.

01:01:23.334 --> 01:01:26.240
<i>I saw us at his graduation.</i>

01:01:28.404 --> 01:01:31.728
<i>Tahir, I saw us old together.</i>

01:01:33.374 --> 01:01:35.644
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

01:01:36.743 --> 01:01:39.580
<i>I haven't been able to see
past the day in so long.</i>

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.507
<i>And...</i>

01:01:41.607 --> 01:01:43.844
<i>I just thought about...</i>

01:01:44.457 --> 01:01:46.839
<i>what we would do and...</i>

01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:50.359
<i>where we would go.</i>

01:01:51.423 --> 01:01:53.828
<i>It was nice, you know?</i>

01:01:55.659 --> 01:01:57.365
<i>Simple.</i>

01:01:59.462 --> 01:02:02.516
<i>But it felt like there was magic in it.</i>

01:02:03.331 --> 01:02:06.137
<i>Like I could move the horizon.</i>

01:02:10.803 --> 01:02:12.639
Mister...

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:14.674
- Mister...
- Abdi.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:17.076
Abdi had a chronic asthmatic attack

01:02:17.176 --> 01:02:19.745
which is probably due
to a combination of the flu

01:02:19.845 --> 01:02:24.986
that you say he was suffering from
and perhaps the dust from hotel room.

01:02:25.186 --> 01:02:29.165
It's not impossible that the steam
you say he was inhaling

01:02:29.265 --> 01:02:30.855
acted as a trigger for the asthma attack.

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:34.558
It's very difficult to know. It's rare,
but we do see that sometimes, too.

01:02:34.658 --> 01:02:36.593
But he is stable now.

01:02:36.693 --> 01:02:40.496
We have him on a breather mask and it's
supplying him with oxygen and Albuterol.

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:43.398
And he's also taking a steroid.
It's called prednisone.

01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:47.368
It's to help him breathe.
It's one of the cortical steroids.

01:02:47.468 --> 01:02:51.772
It mimics the adrenal gland
and acts as an anti-inflammatory.

01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:55.709
But he'll be fine, right?

01:02:55.809 --> 01:02:58.911
- Oh, he'll be fine.
- Okay.

01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:01.476
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're very welcome. I just...

01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:03.904
Can I stay with him?

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.551
Are you married?

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:10.208
We're together.

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.557
What Mr. Abdi needs right now is rest.

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:18.326
I think it's best if you come back
tomorrow during visiting hours.

01:03:18.426 --> 01:03:19.960
- I understand.
- Okay?

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.965
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:39.377 --> 01:03:41.413
Did I miss curfew?

01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:44.882
Terry. Terry.

01:03:44.982 --> 01:03:48.886
- I didn't miss curfew.
- It's not curfew. Your status is changed.

01:03:48.986 --> 01:03:51.155
Excuse me?

01:03:51.255 --> 01:03:54.991
Your status... has changed.

01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:58.694
I have a room for two people.
You are no longer two people.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:02.197
You received the extension notice
that I gave you...

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:05.333
- that was signed...
- For two people.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:06.948
You're only one person.

01:04:07.048 --> 01:04:10.384
I'm sorry but I cannot in good conscience
give you the room.

01:04:10.837 --> 01:04:13.039
Why are you doing this?

01:04:13.139 --> 01:04:15.307
Is that room even occupied?

01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:17.845
You're missing the point, Hannah.

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:22.578
Evil minded, you know that, Terry?

01:04:22.878 --> 01:04:25.115
What happened to you?

01:04:25.515 --> 01:04:28.384
Whatever happened to make you
such an asshole?

01:04:28.484 --> 01:04:30.452
Whatever it was I hope it fucking hurt.

01:04:30.552 --> 01:04:34.622
I hope it wakes you up at night haunted,
you sad fucking sadist.

01:04:34.722 --> 01:04:39.135
- Enjoy the streets, Hannah.
- You know what? Go fuck yourself, Terry.

01:04:51.502 --> 01:04:53.540
Excuse me, miss.

01:04:56.172 --> 01:04:58.511
Excuse me, miss.

01:04:59.408 --> 01:05:01.811
Have you been through triage?

01:05:03.211 --> 01:05:07.116
Sorry. No, I'm not a patient.

01:05:07.216 --> 01:05:09.418
I'm sorry, miss,
but you're gonna have to leave.

01:05:09.518 --> 01:05:13.280
My boyfriend's here. Upstairs.

01:05:15.422 --> 01:05:18.092
I don't have anywhere else to go.

01:05:18.592 --> 01:05:21.007
It's past curfew at the shelters.

01:05:25.096 --> 01:05:27.402
Did you say your husband?

01:05:28.766 --> 01:05:31.238
Your next of kin, right?

01:05:33.202 --> 01:05:37.274
- Yeah, my husband, that's right.
- Well, okay then.

01:05:37.974 --> 01:05:40.243
Just for tonight.

01:05:40.543 --> 01:05:43.512
- I don't wanna see you here tomorrow night.
- You won't.

01:05:43.612 --> 01:05:46.047
I will throw you out.

01:05:46.147 --> 01:05:48.818
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:10.635
- Hi.
- Hey!

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:17.173
Sorry I haven't been here.
I've been running around all day.

01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:21.443
Where did you sleep?

01:06:23.507 --> 01:06:28.193
I'm trying to sort out the Terry thing.
I don't think it's gonna work out.

01:06:29.512 --> 01:06:33.984
- Do you have a place for tonight?
- Yeah. I found a placement.

01:06:34.084 --> 01:06:36.955
It was hard though. Everything's
booked up because of the storm so...

01:06:37.055 --> 01:06:41.490
- I can't even stay long, but...
- Get going. You don't want to miss curfew.

01:06:44.321 --> 01:06:46.057
Asshole.

01:06:46.457 --> 01:06:48.742
You fucking scared me.

01:06:50.494 --> 01:06:53.763
- I missed you.
- I won't have too much longer.

01:06:53.863 --> 01:06:56.702
They're letting me go tomorrow.

01:06:58.132 --> 01:07:00.298
We've been observing him for three days.

01:07:00.398 --> 01:07:03.103
He's ambulant and he's well enough
to leave the hospital.

01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:08.978
- If he continues to take his medication...
- Really? Because it's 20 degrees outside.

01:07:09.078 --> 01:07:12.219
And by the way,
you are required to treat everyone

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:14.012
regardless of the immigration status.

01:07:14.112 --> 01:07:16.847
This has nothing to do with his status
as an illegal immigrant.

01:07:16.947 --> 01:07:21.083
We've looked after him well. He has had
great care. He is simply well enough...

01:07:21.183 --> 01:07:24.196
Excuse me. It's a crock of shit.
I'm sorry. You know it.

01:07:24.296 --> 01:07:26.618
You know it's about a bed.
He's not well enough to leave.

01:07:26.718 --> 01:07:30.224
I'm sorry. What qualifies you
to make that prognosis?

01:07:30.324 --> 01:07:32.959
You don't have to be a doctor to see
that he's not well enough to leave.

01:07:33.059 --> 01:07:37.562
Actually, yes, you do.
I spent four years as an undergraduate.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.631
Four years in med school,
three years in residency,

01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:44.934
and a further two in fellowship. All of
which makes me a quote unquote doctor.

01:07:45.034 --> 01:07:48.270
And in my opinion,
this patient, Tahir Abdi,

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:51.123
is fit and well enough
to leave this hospital.

01:08:00.078 --> 01:08:01.747
I got stuck at the hospital.

01:08:01.847 --> 01:08:04.549
I'm sorry, Hannah. It's just regulation.

01:08:04.649 --> 01:08:07.384
It was curfew and there was
still a line of people.

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:10.653
- I'm not allowed to hold your bed.
- I know. I know.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:15.727
Just stay calm. Let me make a phone call.
See if I can find you a placement.

01:08:18.407 --> 01:08:21.479
Tracy? Did she speak to Tracy?

01:08:23.661 --> 01:08:25.697
I don't know.

01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:30.737
Okay. Well, go have a seat.
I'll go see what I can find out.

01:08:46.879 --> 01:08:52.117
Okay, I don't know who she spoke to,
but we are definitely full to the bursting.

01:08:52.216 --> 01:08:58.055
But I found you a place
at the Tillary Street Women's Shelter.

01:08:58.154 --> 01:09:00.393
In Brooklyn?

01:09:01.089 --> 01:09:03.546
Okay, so I gotta get to Brooklyn.

01:09:03.647 --> 01:09:06.627
It was the only thing I could find.

01:09:07.028 --> 01:09:11.729
Usually our van would be here to...
take you over there,

01:09:11.828 --> 01:09:15.072
but because of the storm.

01:09:17.435 --> 01:09:20.107
Look, here.

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:25.514
You're gonna wanna take
the R to... Jay Street.

01:10:02.979 --> 01:10:05.315
You look freezing.

01:10:05.415 --> 01:10:07.753
I've got reason to.

01:10:08.516 --> 01:10:11.086
Don't you have anywhere to go?

01:10:11.486 --> 01:10:13.955
Nope, not tonight.

01:10:14.055 --> 01:10:19.130
It's a rough night to be out.
It's not fit to walk a dog in.

01:10:23.195 --> 01:10:25.966
My daughter's about your age.

01:10:26.666 --> 01:10:28.668
Oh, yeah?

01:10:29.168 --> 01:10:31.447
What's her name?

01:10:32.903 --> 01:10:35.740
Listen, I can't let you in here.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.392
They have cameras all over the lobby

01:10:38.492 --> 01:10:42.217
and it's more than my job is worth,
but if you go around the block,

01:10:42.317 --> 01:10:45.882
I can let you in the back
and you can sleep in the boiler room.

01:10:45.982 --> 01:10:48.517
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:10:48.717 --> 01:10:51.853
So I'll meet you around back.

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:54.489
Okay? It's a big, green metal door.

01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:57.060
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:08.735
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, you're welcome very much.

01:11:08.835 --> 01:11:12.240
Couldn't have you get to your death
out there, could we?

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.643
I'm sorry. It's not much.

01:11:18.743 --> 01:11:22.213
Oh, no. It's perfect, honestly.

01:11:22.313 --> 01:11:24.982
There's more blankets in there.

01:11:25.082 --> 01:11:27.620
It's so kind of you, really.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.290
I'm beginning to feel my feet again.

01:11:37.157 --> 01:11:39.593
What are you expecting?

01:11:40.893 --> 01:11:43.396
Well, now I'm embarrassed.

01:11:43.896 --> 01:11:46.933
I mean you're getting a bed
for the night...

01:11:47.733 --> 01:11:51.072
so we don't have to... but you know...

01:11:51.772 --> 01:11:56.596
this is New York.
It's not a something for nothing town.

01:12:14.923 --> 01:12:18.664
Look. Let me look at your face.

01:12:33.874 --> 01:12:35.613
Mary.

01:12:43.281 --> 01:12:45.951
My daughter's name is Mary.

01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:48.754
You asked earlier.

01:12:49.554 --> 01:12:52.056
She married a real clean guy.

01:12:52.356 --> 01:12:55.061
They live out in Jersey City.

01:12:57.158 --> 01:12:59.464
Three kids.

01:13:05.264 --> 01:13:08.802
Listen, I need you out of here by five.

01:13:08.902 --> 01:13:12.144
Five-fifteen at the latest, okay?

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.978
I'll wake you up at four forty-five.
I'll bring you a coffee.

01:13:17.941 --> 01:13:19.644
Okay?

01:13:20.244 --> 01:13:21.982
Okay?

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.673
Look, since you aren't married,

01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:22.700
the city is gonna give you a hard time
if you want shelter together.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.166
We'll go to BAT
to get you guys a placement,

01:14:25.266 --> 01:14:27.404
but for the best chance,
we need to gather some documents

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:31.570
and that'll take a few days,
maybe even a week.

01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:36.311
The best I can do right now is get you
into separate shelters for men and women.

01:14:36.411 --> 01:14:38.978
He couldn't get into a shelter.

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.701
They said he was a...

01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:47.421
risk and disturbance with his coughing so...

01:14:47.521 --> 01:14:50.430
they sent him back to the hospital
who won't take him either.

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:54.927
I see it all the time. People push back
and forth between shelter and hospital.

01:14:55.027 --> 01:14:57.595
And finally, they give up.

01:14:58.395 --> 01:15:00.968
It's just not an option.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:06.305
He can't be on the streets right now.

01:15:08.302 --> 01:15:12.203
That's why we really need a place
where I can look after him.

01:15:12.503 --> 01:15:14.244
Okay.

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:17.444
Look, we will do everything we can,

01:15:17.544 --> 01:15:22.417
but there's just no place I can
get you both into tonight as a couple.

01:15:22.847 --> 01:15:26.486
Here's a list of some
of the documents we'll need.

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:33.005
And in the meantime, I can arrange a place
for you to stay tonight on your own.

01:15:40.525 --> 01:15:41.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:41.793 --> 01:15:44.631
- I got you a sandwich.
- Cool.

01:15:46.596 --> 01:15:50.934
- Any luck?
- Nothing. Not even Abdul had space.

01:15:51.034 --> 01:15:54.996
You? Not even for yourself?

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.706
No.

01:15:58.806 --> 01:16:02.546
- I couldn't find anything.
- Not even for yourself, Hannah?

01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:13.685
- I want you to go home.
- I want you back with me.

01:16:13.785 --> 01:16:16.354
It would be easier for me
if you were not here.

01:16:16.454 --> 01:16:19.557
- How much medicine do you have left?
- Enough.

01:16:20.057 --> 01:16:22.328
I have enough.

01:16:29.364 --> 01:16:31.770
I know a place.

01:16:32.433 --> 01:16:35.239
I know a place we can go
and stay together.

01:16:43.943 --> 01:16:46.816
We are very grateful. Thank you.

01:16:48.013 --> 01:16:51.654
I'm not so sure this is such a great idea.

01:16:54.118 --> 01:16:56.130
I mean, there was
just one of you last time.

01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:58.657
It'll be the same as before.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:01.494
We'll be quiet.

01:17:03.258 --> 01:17:06.662
You'll be out of here
every morning at five?

01:17:06.762 --> 01:17:09.932
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:13.951
Okay. We'll try it.

01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:16.809
I'd sure like to help you people,
but I don't wanna lose my job.

01:17:16.909 --> 01:17:19.037
You know...

01:17:24.675 --> 01:17:26.780
Where's your inhaler?

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:30.750
Where is it?

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.621
And the steroids?

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.253
Okay.

01:17:41.553 --> 01:17:43.254
Alright.

01:17:43.354 --> 01:17:45.422
I'm here.

01:17:45.522 --> 01:17:47.590
I'm here.

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.458
Breathe. Breathe.

01:17:50.558 --> 01:17:52.327
Exhale.

01:17:59.499 --> 01:18:01.822
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:32.831 --> 01:18:35.902
So this is fifty.

01:18:36.002 --> 01:18:38.308
This will cost you thirty-five

01:18:38.408 --> 01:18:41.690
and the steroids are...

01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:46.179
- two eighty-five.
- Two eighty-five.

01:18:49.085 --> 01:18:53.903
You know, I lost his insurance card.
Is there any way that you could process it?

01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:58.842
I can't do anything without a prescription.
Can you have your doctor call it in?

01:19:00.886 --> 01:19:03.893
What are the last four digits
of his social?

01:19:16.967 --> 01:19:18.835
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:19.835 --> 01:19:24.840
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, who's that?

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.708
<i>Jake.</i>

01:19:27.008 --> 01:19:29.076
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:32.979
Is your grandpa there?

01:19:33.079 --> 01:19:34.855
<i>Gramp!</i>

01:19:40.552 --> 01:19:42.321
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:42.521 --> 01:19:44.289
<i>Hello?</i>

01:19:44.389 --> 01:19:47.391
- <i>Who is this?</i>
- Hi, Dad.

01:19:48.691 --> 01:19:52.128
<i>Hannah? Hannah, is that you?</i>

01:19:52.228 --> 01:19:55.765
<i>Where are you? Are you coming home?
Tell me you're coming home.</i>

01:19:56.665 --> 01:19:58.567
I wanna come home, yeah.

01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:01.335
<i>Well, where are you? I'll come get you!</i>

01:20:03.635 --> 01:20:05.973
- I'm still in New York.
- <i>That's great.</i>

01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:08.611
<i>I can be on a plane by tonight.</i>

01:20:09.574 --> 01:20:13.853
No. No, you don't have to do that...

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:19.589
Maybe you can just wire
the money for a train ticket.

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:24.553
<i>Hannah, you know I can't do that.</i>

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:27.722
<i>Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.</i>

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:30.091
I'm clean, Dad.

01:20:30.191 --> 01:20:34.870
- I swear to God.
- <i>No, I can't. I can't. I can't.</i>

01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:39.799
Truth is, I need the money
for my boyfriend.

01:20:39.899 --> 01:20:42.801
He's sick. He's run out of his meds.

01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:45.862
- <i>No, no, I can't wire you money.</i>
- I'm not using.

01:20:45.962 --> 01:20:48.948
- <i>And you know why. You've said that.</i>
- I'm not using, Dad. I swear to God.

01:20:49.048 --> 01:20:51.606
- It's been four months now.
- <i>You've said this before, Hannah.</i>

01:20:51.706 --> 01:20:54.309
I know, I know, I know I have
and I know how it sounds,

01:20:54.409 --> 01:20:56.710
but I promise you this time it's true.

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:59.879
- <i>Why did you lie to me about the train ticket?</i>
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:20:59.979 --> 01:21:03.115
Stupid. Stupid. I just...

01:21:03.215 --> 01:21:06.552
He's... he's... he needs his meds.

01:21:06.652 --> 01:21:10.022
He's so sick and I didn't think
you'd believe me.

01:21:10.122 --> 01:21:12.791
They cost three hundred
and seventy dollars. I...

01:21:12.891 --> 01:21:15.826
<i>Well, if he's that ill then you
should take him to a hospital.</i>

01:21:15.926 --> 01:21:18.164
We've been.

01:21:18.994 --> 01:21:20.731
Look...

01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:25.312
Dad, I know you shouldn't believe me.

01:21:25.568 --> 01:21:28.506
I know that I've given you no reason to.

01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:31.038
- I promise.
- <i>No, honey. You're lying.</i>

01:21:31.138 --> 01:21:34.899
- <i>You're lying, sweetheart.</i>
- Please. Just this one more time.

01:21:34.999 --> 01:21:37.377
Please. This time it's true.

01:21:37.477 --> 01:21:40.513
<i>I wanna believe you so much, Hannah.</i>

01:21:40.613 --> 01:21:42.415
You can.

01:21:42.915 --> 01:21:45.284
Dad, you can.

01:21:45.384 --> 01:21:48.870
I just need a little bit of money...

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.656
and just a little bit more time
and I'm gonna be home.

01:21:51.756 --> 01:21:55.025
<i>If I give you money,
then I'm part of the problem, Hannah.</i>

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:59.162
<i>And I can't be part of the problem
anymore. I can't help you, Hannah.</i>

01:21:59.262 --> 01:22:02.762
<i>I love you. I love you.
But until you want help...</i>

01:22:02.862 --> 01:22:05.301
- <i>...I can't help you.</i>
- I want help.

01:22:05.401 --> 01:22:07.836
I want help, Dad.

01:22:07.936 --> 01:22:09.976
- Come see us.
- <i>No, you're lying.</i>

01:22:10.076 --> 01:22:14.128
- Come see us if you don't believe me.
- <i>I love you. I love you so much.</i>

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:18.545
I love you. I love you, Dad.
I love you, Dad. Don't go, please!

01:22:18.645 --> 01:22:20.683
<i>I can't!</i>

01:22:22.481 --> 01:22:24.185
Fuck!

01:22:43.533 --> 01:22:48.638
I... put some cushions
that I found in my garage

01:22:48.738 --> 01:22:50.740
in your place there.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.911
Thank you.

01:22:56.877 --> 01:22:59.447
I need some money for medication.

01:22:59.947 --> 01:23:02.381
Can you help me?

01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:06.722
Sure, how much do you need?

01:23:08.552 --> 01:23:11.289
Three hundred and seventy dollars.

01:23:11.789 --> 01:23:13.560
Okay.

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:17.362
Okay.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:22.570
What does three seventy get me?

01:23:25.465 --> 01:23:27.948
Well, what do you expect for that?

01:23:28.048 --> 01:23:30.820
I don't wanna negotiate
with myself, Hannah.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.540
You just tell me what you wanna do for it,

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.661
and then we'll come to a compromise.

01:24:18.697 --> 01:24:21.778
Merry secular Christmas to you.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:46.658
How did you do this?

01:24:46.758 --> 01:24:50.661
- Never you mind.
- No, really.

01:24:50.761 --> 01:24:54.800
- How did this happen?
- It's a Christmas miracle.

01:25:16.016 --> 01:25:19.072
Where did you get the money from, Hannah?

01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:26.795
- It doesn't matter.
- Because it does.

01:25:28.959 --> 01:25:31.164
Don't be angry.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:35.098
I want us to be happy tonight.

01:25:35.198 --> 01:25:37.269
You're better.

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:41.068
I need to know.

01:25:55.748 --> 01:25:59.118
I called my father and asked him
to wire some money for a train ticket.

01:25:59.218 --> 01:26:01.386
Hannah, you should've bought the ticket.

01:26:01.486 --> 01:26:06.558
I called him back. I told him
that I'd lied and explained to him why.

01:26:08.223 --> 01:26:11.878
He said tomorrow he's gonna
wire the money for two tickets.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.766
I won't go alone, Tahir.

01:26:18.547 --> 01:26:20.018
I won't.

01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:30.451
Alright.

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:34.162
Tomorrow we will go.

01:26:41.016 --> 01:26:43.185
We're gonna live, Tahir.

01:26:43.285 --> 01:26:47.674
I mean, really... really live.

01:27:12.778 --> 01:27:15.579
Tonight's our last night with you.

01:27:18.449 --> 01:27:21.386
You know there's another storm coming.

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:23.788
We're going away.

01:27:25.765 --> 01:27:27.527
Okay.

01:27:29.158 --> 01:27:31.355
I'll miss you.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.499
I mean it.

01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:38.532
I'll miss you.

01:27:40.566 --> 01:27:42.769
Where are you going?

01:27:42.869 --> 01:27:45.074
Out west.

01:27:47.105 --> 01:27:48.870
Beautiful.

01:27:51.775 --> 01:27:54.602
I need five hundred dollars.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.861
Hannah?

01:28:22.118 --> 01:28:23.878
Hannah.

01:29:35.001 --> 01:29:38.437
Not for me? Not for me?

01:29:38.537 --> 01:29:40.842
You fucking bastard.

01:29:48.142 --> 01:29:49.866
No!

01:31:57.129 --> 01:31:59.715
Here. Eat.

01:31:59.815 --> 01:32:02.067
- I'm not hungry.
- Just some soup?

01:32:02.167 --> 01:32:05.468
- While it's warm. Please?
- Stop.

01:32:06.568 --> 01:32:08.908
Did you take your meds?

01:32:10.371 --> 01:32:12.910
- Tahir?
- Yes.

01:32:14.608 --> 01:32:17.177
- They're not helping?
- No.

01:32:17.277 --> 01:32:19.105
Okay, let's go to the hospital. Now.

01:32:19.205 --> 01:32:21.641
- And then what?
- And then you'll get well.

01:32:21.741 --> 01:32:24.133
- Then I go to prison.
- Don't.

01:32:24.233 --> 01:32:26.151
And you spend the rest
of your life waiting for me.

01:32:26.251 --> 01:32:28.053
Don't!

01:32:28.353 --> 01:32:31.422
We've tried too hard for you to do this.

01:32:31.622 --> 01:32:33.447
Hannah...

01:32:34.047 --> 01:32:36.617
I want you to go home.

01:32:37.359 --> 01:32:39.661
I won't leave you.

01:32:39.961 --> 01:32:42.504
Listen to me, Hannah.

01:32:45.165 --> 01:32:48.938
I have a chance to do
one good thing with my life.

01:32:50.035 --> 01:32:52.325
Let me do it.

01:32:54.438 --> 01:32:56.607
Lie down.

01:32:56.707 --> 01:33:01.097
Come, Hannah. Please come, Hannah.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.912
Come.

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.250
Hannah.

01:33:10.016 --> 01:33:12.088
Lie down.

01:33:19.157 --> 01:33:21.655
Go home to your family.

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:26.142
And I'll go home to mine.

01:33:29.398 --> 01:33:31.747
Last night...

01:33:31.847 --> 01:33:34.076
I dreamt...

01:33:34.176 --> 01:33:38.238
Ibriham put his hand
in the River Ongatu back home.

01:33:39.473 --> 01:33:42.762
And the water that swirled
around his fingers...

01:33:43.262 --> 01:33:45.885
made its way to Lake Chad...

01:33:46.515 --> 01:33:49.333
<i>and down the River Niger...</i>

01:33:49.683 --> 01:33:52.652
<i>and into the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

01:33:53.952 --> 01:33:56.498
<i>At that same moment...</i>

01:33:56.930 --> 01:34:00.508
<i>I put my hand in the East River here...</i>

01:34:02.194 --> 01:34:05.096
<i>and our fingers touched.</i>

01:34:05.996 --> 01:34:08.529
<i>His little hand...</i>

01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:11.097
<i>in my big hand.</i>

01:34:13.902 --> 01:34:17.340
<i>I would like to think
I am going to see my son again</i>

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:19.794
<i>and be with Iza...</i>

01:34:20.594 --> 01:34:25.114
<i>but I am afraid I am going to hell
for the things I have done.</i>

01:34:25.714 --> 01:34:30.567
<i>Or worse, that you are right
and there is nothing.</i>

01:34:32.719 --> 01:34:36.523
You are the kindest man
that I have ever known.

01:34:36.623 --> 01:34:38.857
You're an angel.

01:34:39.657 --> 01:34:42.063
You're not going to hell.

01:34:47.064 --> 01:34:51.301
Nothing as perfect as you
could exist without a reason.

01:39:33.035 --> 01:39:37.634
For the couple
who lived outside my building.
