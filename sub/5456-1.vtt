02:27.680 --> 02:29.477
She got a sweetheart yet?

02:30.016 --> 02:33.782
No time to date.
The hospital keeps her too busy

02:34.220 --> 02:37.246
She was always first in her class.
Not like my lazy Raymond

02:37.457 --> 02:40.153
He never opens a book,
only his wallet

02:40.460 --> 02:45.124
At 29, he's already VP of his company.
What are you complaining about?

02:45.331 --> 02:50.359
Yeah, money seems to cling to him,
but what's the use?

02:50.570 --> 02:52.834
He's only 5'8"

02:54.274 --> 02:55.468
Let me tell you…

02:56.142 --> 02:59.805
…every Friday, Wilhelmina
comes home for the dance

03:01.481 --> 03:03.915
Good. See you there tonight

03:04.117 --> 03:08.178
Be discrete. Nothing kills romance
faster than a mother's approval

03:08.388 --> 03:10.015
Have faith, I know what to do

03:10.223 --> 03:13.556
And make sure his hands are clean.
It’s flu season

03:13.760 --> 03:16.251
I’ll wash them myself if I have to

03:34.914 --> 03:36.313
You're late again

03:36.749 --> 03:40.344
- All the crab is gone.
- This party's a bust. Let's go to KFC

03:40.553 --> 03:42.453
Cheeky girl

03:42.755 --> 03:45.656
So thin. You'll catch your death

03:48.628 --> 03:51.290
I see men's clothes
are still in style

03:54.534 --> 04:00.131
Let me button that for you.
People are going to think….

04:15.221 --> 04:18.553
Wil, I love your outfit!

04:20.660 --> 04:22.753
Don't you think it's too boyish?

04:22.962 --> 04:24.793
Nonsense

04:25.665 --> 04:28.031
I had a pair just like those
during the Revolution

04:28.801 --> 04:31.429
Sturdy and practical.
Just the thing for war

04:31.638 --> 04:33.765
Your high heels on the other hand….

04:33.973 --> 04:36.339
Those things will kill you

04:36.542 --> 04:39.375
It’ll be a miracle
if you don't trip and die

04:39.579 --> 04:41.444
I’m going to get some squid

04:42.849 --> 04:44.510
Hey, Grandma

04:52.091 --> 04:53.683
Good to see you, Old Yu

05:28.695 --> 05:30.322
Let me say a few words

05:31.631 --> 05:35.294
As the lazy toads
of summer give way…

05:35.601 --> 05:37.865
…to the crackling
of autumn leaves…

05:38.838 --> 05:43.639
…one's mind naturally turns toward
the demise of our children's education

06:21.547 --> 06:25.847
I give thanks to the woman
who has suffered alongside me

06:27.120 --> 06:31.716
- I toast you.
- Okay, no more suffering. Let's eat

06:54.380 --> 06:56.848
Look at those two

06:57.049 --> 06:58.949
Don't their faces
reflect good marriage chi?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.586
Depends on whose marriage

07:02.121 --> 07:05.113
Hey, Albert!
Don't eat too much of that cabbage

07:05.324 --> 07:07.315
It gives you gas!

07:15.067 --> 07:16.830
Your Raymond is such a gentleman

07:17.036 --> 07:20.301
Anyone looks good on his arm

07:42.962 --> 07:44.725
Another great party

07:45.264 --> 07:47.892
My husband and I fought
all the way over here

07:48.367 --> 07:51.598
But I’m having a great time.
Is there more wine?

08:05.751 --> 08:10.654
They say her ex-husband has a
new wife 20 years younger than her

08:10.957 --> 08:13.858
Serves her right.
He made good money

08:14.627 --> 08:16.288
What's to be unhappy about?

08:16.762 --> 08:20.721
Marry a rooster, follow the rooster.
Marry a dog, follow the dog

08:20.933 --> 08:23.424
Why be like those Americans,
divorcing all the time?

08:23.636 --> 08:26.400
She'll never marry again.
Women never do

08:26.606 --> 08:29.268
She's certainly not meeting
anyone here

08:29.475 --> 08:31.033
Still…

08:31.244 --> 08:33.905
…must be lonely at these parties
without a man

08:34.113 --> 08:37.309
What do you think those morons
talk about anyway?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.145
The usual ball scratching

08:40.520 --> 08:43.886
They say he's got a new wife
on the Upper East Side

08:44.190 --> 08:46.590
I heard she's 20 years younger

08:46.792 --> 08:51.092
My back hurts just thinking about it

08:51.297 --> 08:53.629
I plan to be married soon myself

08:54.400 --> 08:55.799
Anyone in mind?

08:59.906 --> 09:02.636
Good luck. You'll have to get
past her father first

09:12.552 --> 09:14.281
Just plain friends

09:22.528 --> 09:24.519
Forget meat on the grill,
and it will dry out

09:24.730 --> 09:28.166
- Right. So my ma says.
- Does she?

09:28.367 --> 09:30.335
She's quite a woman

09:30.536 --> 09:35.906
Ever since your father passed away,
she's been so delicate

09:36.108 --> 09:39.874
These 20-odd years
you've been all she has

09:40.079 --> 09:41.671
Wilhelmina!

09:42.848 --> 09:45.544
Yeah. She's delicate

09:48.854 --> 09:51.414
I’m not feeling so well.
Take me home

09:52.592 --> 09:57.120
It’s those heels, I tell you!

10:12.845 --> 10:14.506
Thanks, Little Yu

10:14.714 --> 10:16.409
Home to see your grandparents?

10:24.423 --> 10:25.913
I have station duty Friday nights

10:28.794 --> 10:30.318
From my father

10:30.529 --> 10:32.087
He still telling fortunes?

10:32.298 --> 10:36.758
As long as there are anxious wives
and mothers, he'll be in business

10:38.804 --> 10:42.001
Your mother asked him
to give you some herbs…

10:42.208 --> 10:44.472
…to improve your fortitude
for marriage

10:51.884 --> 10:55.115
Give it a try. Those herbs
are good for your heart anyway

11:18.577 --> 11:22.604
Professor, your chi is so potent…

11:22.815 --> 11:26.046
…you've managed to hold
the court once again

11:27.086 --> 11:30.954
No fortunes to tell this morning,
Old Yu?

11:31.157 --> 11:34.615
Most people don't want to hear
the truth until after lunch

11:34.927 --> 11:41.298
Fate is for the lazy

11:41.901 --> 11:44.165
Too true, too true

11:44.370 --> 11:47.601
But I won't lie,
my only morning customer…

11:47.807 --> 11:50.469
…was your only daughter

11:50.676 --> 11:52.041
Her?

11:52.244 --> 11:54.235
What does she have to worry about?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.847
She lives safely at home with us

11:57.283 --> 11:59.046
Her daughter's a doctor

11:59.251 --> 12:02.049
- What more could she want?
- Indeed

12:02.254 --> 12:06.623
But her health may be a bit bumpy
this year

12:06.926 --> 12:10.453
Ridiculous. She's only 48

12:10.663 --> 12:13.154
Could be menopause

12:13.632 --> 12:15.224
Menopause?

12:15.901 --> 12:18.301
Nonsense

12:18.504 --> 12:21.268
Only Americans freak out
about menopause

15:11.810 --> 15:14.608
Thank God you're here!
I’ve been waiting for hours

15:16.215 --> 15:18.945
This is a crummy neighborhood

15:19.151 --> 15:20.914
Take this

15:25.858 --> 15:27.223
Do I look sick to you?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.821
Pick up that bag

15:32.031 --> 15:35.990
Don't be ridiculous.
She'll outlive us all

15:37.836 --> 15:38.962
Do I look like I’m crying?

15:45.978 --> 15:48.242
You're just going to let me
freeze to death here?

16:11.236 --> 16:13.136
Tell me what happened

16:17.076 --> 16:19.601
All right. I’m calling Grandma

16:19.812 --> 16:24.112
Is that how you speak to your ma
who worked nights so you could eat?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.216
Who stayed in labor
without painkillers…

16:26.418 --> 16:29.114
…so you wouldn't turn dim-witted
like your cousin Jimmy?

16:29.321 --> 16:32.916
Had I known
you would grow so ungrateful…

16:33.125 --> 16:35.286
…I would have held you in

16:37.963 --> 16:39.294
Has she eaten?

16:39.598 --> 16:40.792
What is she doing here?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.798
She'll need better nutrition now

16:44.003 --> 16:45.231
She's not that old

16:48.040 --> 16:50.235
Wait, I can't hear. Ma

16:50.442 --> 16:52.307
Can you pipe down?

16:53.245 --> 16:55.975
It’s good for her to stay with you.
You're a doctor

16:56.181 --> 16:57.409
You can help her…

16:57.616 --> 16:59.607
…maybe get free drugs
from the hospital

17:03.389 --> 17:05.618
- Okay.
- You'll pick up her things tomorrow

17:05.824 --> 17:08.987
- I’ll bring her back tomorrow.
- I'll prepare herbs from Old Yu

17:09.194 --> 17:11.185
They'll help her with the baby

17:18.837 --> 17:21.532
- Pregnant!
- At her age!

17:21.740 --> 17:23.367
- It’s a scandal!
- A disgrace!

17:23.575 --> 17:26.771
- It’s better than the soaps!
- More drama!

17:26.979 --> 17:29.072
- More intrigue!
- More eel!

17:29.281 --> 17:32.250
Don't eat so much eel!
It gives you gas

17:32.651 --> 17:34.642
Who's the father?

17:36.955 --> 17:38.752
Who is the father?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.158
- Father.
- Don't call me Father!

17:41.360 --> 17:43.851
You are the biggest disgrace,
the ultimate shame

17:44.063 --> 17:46.395
What kind of example are you
for your daughter?

17:46.598 --> 17:50.398
- You're not pregnant too are you?
- Me? No. No

17:51.937 --> 17:54.701
No daughter has shamed her parents
more than you

17:54.907 --> 17:58.240
What have we done
to deserve this?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.207
Do you have any idea
who the father is?

18:02.414 --> 18:03.904
Can't bring it up

18:04.283 --> 18:07.013
She just cries and goes on
about how ungrateful I am

18:08.320 --> 18:10.618
How did you find out she was…?

18:10.823 --> 18:13.519
The receptionist
at the Manhattan clinic…

18:13.725 --> 18:16.057
…is married to one
of Grandpa's former students

18:21.066 --> 18:24.365
He's going to banish her
from Flushing. Where will she go?

18:25.504 --> 18:29.065
He can't do this to her.
She belongs here

18:29.975 --> 18:32.443
Who is the father?

18:33.645 --> 18:36.375
You won't tell us? Fine

18:40.252 --> 18:42.482
Take all the ones
with your mother in them

18:42.688 --> 18:45.521
She is no longer
a part of this family

18:45.724 --> 18:47.919
Father. Don't be like this

18:49.128 --> 18:53.224
When I think of all we've sacrificed
in the old country…

18:53.732 --> 18:58.533
…to give you kids a better life
in the new one

18:58.737 --> 19:03.902
Had I known, I would have left you
behind in the mainland

19:04.676 --> 19:06.541
Father, please don't feel shamed

19:06.745 --> 19:08.645
How can I not feel shame?

19:08.847 --> 19:12.943
My own rotten flesh has gotten
pregnant without a husband

19:13.485 --> 19:17.649
You don't think people
will laugh at me?

19:18.423 --> 19:21.654
The professor speaks big words…

19:21.860 --> 19:23.623
…but can't control his own daughter?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.263
Old man, this situation won't improve
with yelling

19:26.465 --> 19:27.898
She wasn't even going to tell us

19:28.100 --> 19:31.797
She can throw her own reputation
away, but it still comes back to me

19:33.472 --> 19:35.167
Still crying?

19:37.943 --> 19:39.774
Get out of this house

19:40.612 --> 19:44.844
Don't come back until you have
a husband to match the child

20:18.250 --> 20:22.277
Look how cheerful this red is.
We'll put some up here…

20:22.487 --> 20:24.455
…there and there!

20:24.656 --> 20:27.523
That black is just depressing

20:30.229 --> 20:31.423
You have no oyster sauce

20:31.630 --> 20:33.461
I don't use oyster sauce

20:33.665 --> 20:35.860
Since when do you drink beer?

20:47.813 --> 20:51.044
You shouldn't keep this stuff
unless you plan to use it

20:51.583 --> 20:55.849
Do you plan to keep the…?

20:58.757 --> 21:01.248
What kind of vegetable is this?

21:02.894 --> 21:06.421
I see you just let my face masks
waste away

21:07.165 --> 21:09.599
- What's this?
- Herbs from Old Yu

21:09.801 --> 21:13.168
Every week, he has his son
Little Yu give them to me…

21:13.372 --> 21:15.465
…to improve my marriage chi
or something

21:17.442 --> 21:19.410
Don't be rude,
just hiding them here

21:19.611 --> 21:22.375
I want to have a look

22:05.490 --> 22:07.754
The big one is for your mother.
Morning sickness

22:34.486 --> 22:36.181
You're home

22:36.388 --> 22:38.413
Turn up the TV

22:38.623 --> 22:40.523
It’s just getting to the good part

22:40.726 --> 22:42.523
She's dumping him

22:50.802 --> 22:53.100
Smells great, right? Stinky tofu

22:59.311 --> 23:00.938
No, that's just a special treat

23:01.146 --> 23:04.240
We have chicken, sweet pea stalks,
and fish with bean sauce

23:07.085 --> 23:08.780
Is he coming?

23:13.859 --> 23:15.554
Safer this way.
Throw it out afterwards

23:17.195 --> 23:19.129
I’ll give him two

23:22.768 --> 23:25.430
His shoes! His shoes!

23:28.673 --> 23:30.664
You remember my neighbor, Jay

23:30.876 --> 23:32.070
His shoes!

24:12.784 --> 24:16.117
Your neighbor is loud and dark
and eats too much soy sauce

24:16.588 --> 24:18.783
Americans like soy sauce

24:23.829 --> 24:25.763
I’m going to start eating less
soy sauce…

24:25.964 --> 24:27.829
…so it won't stain the baby too dark

24:30.435 --> 24:34.201
You eat less too,
so you don't grow spots

24:37.676 --> 24:39.667
Too late for him anyway

28:59.304 --> 29:02.967
Excuse me.
Do you have Chinese movies?

33:27.438 --> 33:29.406
Have you eaten?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.350
How long have you been pregnant?

35:00.565 --> 35:02.533
A couple of months

35:04.936 --> 35:06.233
Married?

35:08.906 --> 35:10.430
Once

35:14.512 --> 35:16.912
Children are a blessing
just the same

35:18.282 --> 35:19.544
Number 48

35:22.687 --> 35:25.656
- We need to see the patient alone.
- I’ll be right here

36:44.569 --> 36:49.063
Don't forget. I invited
the mahjong ladies over tonight

36:52.677 --> 36:54.872
So don't bring
any of your friends over

36:59.050 --> 37:01.780
You should get home in time
to say hello to them

37:01.986 --> 37:04.147
You haven't seen them in so long

42:02.987 --> 42:04.852
You missed the mahjong party

42:53.837 --> 42:54.895
I’m not going on a date

42:56.273 --> 42:59.538
Too puffy, better up.
But I’m not going

43:01.812 --> 43:03.336
What's wrong with it?

43:08.452 --> 43:11.888
Chinese people cannot wear yellow

43:20.297 --> 43:23.698
How about this one? It’s sexy

43:23.901 --> 43:26.461
No one wants to see a 50-year-old
Chinese woman look sexy

43:26.804 --> 43:29.034
Ma, you're only 48

43:29.473 --> 43:32.533
Connie Chung's sexy,
and she must be nearly 60

43:32.743 --> 43:34.870
Her show was cancelled

43:38.315 --> 43:41.045
- Is it a white guy?
- No

43:41.251 --> 43:42.912
An ugly old white guy

43:43.120 --> 43:44.712
No. He's Chinese

43:45.756 --> 43:49.886
He's nice, very healthy

43:50.094 --> 43:51.823
Pretty healthy

43:54.698 --> 43:56.188
I’m not going

44:01.605 --> 44:03.698
I’m really not going

44:05.342 --> 44:06.934
Then you go

44:22.192 --> 44:24.183
I don't have enough time

44:25.429 --> 44:27.522
Tell him I’m sick

44:29.199 --> 44:31.064
Lost my voice

44:32.736 --> 44:34.795
What am I going
to talk about anyway?

44:37.174 --> 44:41.042
Forty-eight and going on a date

44:50.120 --> 44:52.384
It’s okay

44:53.590 --> 44:55.387
We have enough time

44:56.093 --> 45:00.792
Look. This dress isn't bad

45:02.032 --> 45:06.799
We'll just take your hair down

45:11.208 --> 45:13.005
What?

45:14.078 --> 45:16.012
What are you looking at?

45:26.890 --> 45:28.881
Do I tell him about the baby?

45:38.202 --> 45:41.194
So, Mr. Fu,
what is your line of work?

45:41.405 --> 45:42.872
I’m in import-export

45:43.607 --> 45:45.905
- Good business?
- Not bad, not bad

45:46.744 --> 45:50.703
Made enough last month
to go on a singles cruise to Fiji

45:52.049 --> 45:55.246
Not that I went

45:58.322 --> 46:01.883
- You're an only daughter?
- Yes

46:02.526 --> 46:04.357
I always wish I had kids

46:04.895 --> 46:07.796
No kids? Do you want any?

46:08.198 --> 46:12.692
No, it's not necessary.
I’m too old now

46:12.903 --> 46:16.703
Besides, I’m fixed down there

46:25.382 --> 46:28.317
Hello, my name is Fu Cheng Wen

46:28.919 --> 46:30.079
Gao Hwei Lan

46:30.287 --> 46:32.187
Can we go now?

46:36.860 --> 46:40.455
- What time are you getting back?
- Before midnight

46:48.672 --> 46:50.765
You're a doctor?

46:51.175 --> 46:54.269
I’ve got a wart on my left calf.
It’s driving me nuts

46:54.478 --> 46:56.969
Can you tell me if it's cancer?

47:20.204 --> 47:24.504
My last wife made me take lessons

47:24.708 --> 47:26.767
The whole year, she would scream：

47:43.260 --> 47:45.160
Fung Ling restaurant

47:48.065 --> 47:51.694
Huge she-crab. So much egg

48:16.927 --> 48:20.556
I think I’m too old to have a child

48:25.469 --> 48:27.937
If these are my dating options…

48:28.772 --> 48:32.538
…I am definitely too old

48:37.180 --> 48:39.546
There's not much left on this tape

48:41.018 --> 48:42.383
Why are you in street clothes?

48:45.923 --> 48:48.483
I can't believe you came
from my womb

48:53.864 --> 48:57.994
No. He's marrying her for money

49:00.070 --> 49:01.196
No

49:01.772 --> 49:03.569
That's his brother

49:08.078 --> 49:10.478
He's the most evil of them all

49:11.014 --> 49:13.278
He wants to ruin her family
to avenge a grudge

49:15.652 --> 49:17.210
That's the good guy

49:20.290 --> 49:22.815
I have found her a husband

49:23.293 --> 49:25.454
She will marry Cho. To the right

49:27.531 --> 49:29.226
I don't think Ma likes him

49:29.433 --> 49:32.800
What's not to like? Back left

49:33.303 --> 49:35.237
He's kind of intense

49:35.439 --> 49:36.770
Who cares?

49:37.708 --> 49:40.506
He's a good man
who will take care of your mother…

49:40.711 --> 49:44.579
…and give both her
and that child a decent name

49:44.781 --> 49:46.942
Where can you find
a man like that?

49:47.150 --> 49:52.110
You will help her see this

49:52.322 --> 49:54.916
I don't think she sees anything
she doesn't want to

49:57.427 --> 49:59.987
She shouldn't be alone

50:03.900 --> 50:06.198
Don't listen to him

50:06.403 --> 50:09.304
Another misunderstanding.
Now they'll never get together

50:11.675 --> 50:13.666
He didn't really. He was drunk

50:16.847 --> 50:18.314
She'd be lonely

50:20.817 --> 50:22.114
Are you lonely?

50:22.319 --> 50:24.810
No, I have you

50:25.022 --> 50:26.512
Why?

50:28.625 --> 50:30.684
It’s too late for me

50:32.796 --> 50:36.664
- What about a father for your child?
- I raised you single-handedly

50:36.867 --> 50:38.061
You turned out all right

50:38.268 --> 50:41.431
I just think you should give
that Cho a chance

50:42.072 --> 50:44.768
Then you wouldn't be alone…

50:45.375 --> 50:48.208
…and it would make
Grandpa happy

50:52.649 --> 50:54.617
Enough soap opera for today

51:05.228 --> 51:09.392
I’m going to be a terrible mother

51:15.739 --> 51:17.604
I don't even like babies

51:20.043 --> 51:22.841
Stephen's always bringing his kid
to the shop

51:23.046 --> 51:27.346
All that drooling. Gross

51:29.119 --> 51:30.711
You were different

51:31.988 --> 51:34.752
You sprung from the womb
already grown-up

51:37.527 --> 51:40.052
And I had your father
during your early years

51:43.233 --> 51:45.098
He was really patient

51:47.070 --> 51:48.765
You have me

54:11.348 --> 54:13.316
Fish is good, Auntie

54:17.988 --> 54:19.421
What do you do?

54:20.624 --> 54:23.252
Vivian's a dancer

54:23.860 --> 54:25.020
A go-go dancer?

54:30.033 --> 54:34.197
I dance with
the New York City Ballet

54:34.404 --> 54:35.871
Oh, ballet

54:37.040 --> 54:39.907
But now I’m…

54:41.211 --> 54:45.341
…taking a break to dance modern

54:53.957 --> 54:56.221
She's very, very good

54:58.028 --> 54:59.689
Not ballet

55:04.334 --> 55:05.733
So is the baby good?

55:13.910 --> 55:15.138
She works too hard

55:15.845 --> 55:19.144
I hardly get to see her

55:37.667 --> 55:39.464
So do you have a boyfriend?

55:44.874 --> 55:45.841
No

55:46.209 --> 55:49.667
Pretty girl like you must have
lots of boys ask you out

55:53.750 --> 55:56.241
Wil’s black neighbor is single…

55:56.453 --> 55:58.512
…always around

55:58.722 --> 56:00.815
You interested?

56:03.093 --> 56:06.028
- You don't like black people?
- Sure, I like--

56:06.229 --> 56:08.629
- She doesn't like black people.
- Yes, she does

56:08.832 --> 56:11.699
- Then why won't she date them?
- Let's just eat

56:32.589 --> 56:35.319
I just want to make sure
my baby gets home safe

56:41.264 --> 56:45.030
Hey, Little Yu.
Isn't my daughter beautiful?

56:45.435 --> 56:46.834
She is indeed

56:47.070 --> 56:48.833
- Say thank you.
- Thank you

56:50.940 --> 56:54.535
Thank your father.
I’ll be calling him tonight

56:54.744 --> 56:58.339
Little Yu's got a solid job
and good benefits

57:55.839 --> 57:59.104
- Great crab, isn't it?
- Smells delicious

57:59.309 --> 58:01.573
There's an old tradition
in Shanghai

58:01.778 --> 58:05.236
They pick their son-in-law based on
his skill at extracting his crab meat

58:08.218 --> 58:09.549
What am I saying?

58:09.752 --> 58:12.983
You can't have crab
because of the--

58:19.329 --> 58:21.559
Your child would be my child

58:22.932 --> 58:26.698
I would make sure you have anything
you want for the rest of your life

58:26.903 --> 58:29.667
I just want you to be happy

58:33.510 --> 58:38.413
There are many women
who would be happy with you

58:39.082 --> 58:41.550
Wouldn't you rather
have someone younger?

58:41.751 --> 58:46.711
Younger people. Today they love you.
Tomorrow, who knows?

58:49.025 --> 58:52.119
It’s better to stick with someone
who can really understand you

58:52.595 --> 58:54.119
Besides…

58:55.498 --> 58:57.625
…I’ve liked you for over 15 years

59:09.279 --> 59:10.803
I had a lovely time

59:12.115 --> 59:14.811
You look lovely in this light

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:43.432
Wonder how the gang is doing
over at the salon

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:10.656
Carrying one child and sending
the other out to do her dirty work

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.351
She never could
take care of herself

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:19.357
Who could the father be?

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:25.307
Do you think the father…

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:28.067
…is someone in our circle?

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:32.543
No way. Fred is too respectful

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:35.582
Len is too scared

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.276
Too lazy

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:43.687
Too busy losing money

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.724
Thank God

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:49.125
Good to know we're safe

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:53.166
Hello, Wilhelmina.
How is that mother of yours?

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:58.035
Didn't you see her the other day
at her mahjong party?

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:01.677
Oh, no. I was busy.
I wasn't able to make it

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:05.780
Me too.
Everyone's so busy these days

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.246
I heard no one went

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.804
What?

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:40.939
He's a nice man

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.792
I just told you. I like him fine

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.271
Mr. Cho took you to the hospital?

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:50.343
He's a good man

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.981
Don't worry, Professor Gao.
Your wife's okay

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.566
My daughter

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:55.764
What were you all so worried about?

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.836
Haven't I been healthy all these years?

01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.599
This is nothing compared to war

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.310
Don't excite yourself

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.103
That's right, Mrs. Gao.
Just relax

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:08.248
You relax. Preferably elsewhere.
I want to speak to my granddaughter

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.075
I’ll be back later

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.481
Me too

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.024
Thank God they're gone

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:22.429
Like I’m so bored I have to listen
to his asinine pandering!

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.160
How's your mother?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.828
She's doing well

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.536
You're talking to me

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.799
She's totally depressed
and humiliated

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.038
Don't tell her about this

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.777
How can I not?

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.810
She has enough on her mind

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:46.385
Your grandfather forbids her
to come anyway

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:49.319
It’ll just make her feel bad

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:51.215
I’ll be out soon

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.224
Promise you won't tell her
until I’m back home

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.858
Grandma….

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.529
Promise me

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.169
You're just in time

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:09.377
She's watching his plane
take off for the States

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:16.163
Stupid girl,
he's so obviously right for you

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.898
We need to talk

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.363
There's not much left on this tape

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.242
I don't think this can wait

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.524
I love you

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.803
And I’m gay

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:05.041
How can you say
those two things at once?

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:09.580
How can you tell me you love me…

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.810
…then throw that in my face?

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:16.218
I am not a bad mother

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.483
My daughter is not gay

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.631
Then maybe I shouldn't be
your daughter

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.843
My dad said this is for the bride

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:21.903
"Hwei Lan…

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.031
…you keep refusing to see me

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:28.037
By the time you read this…

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:33.408
…you may already be Cho's bride

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:39.713
You've said this is the way
fate would have it…

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:46.053
…but if it is your fate
to do your father's bidding…

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:51.129
…then it is my fate to try…

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.824
…and undo yours

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:58.996
Yes, people would talk
about the age difference…."

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.409
It's Old Yu!

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:10.114
I may not be what you pictured
as your future

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:14.020
But I know now that I am the one
destined for you

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:15.685
I love you

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.289
I know you love me

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.790
Shouldn't this be simple?

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:22.688
Twenty-nine years ago…

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:27.565
…you married a man you didn't love
to be the perfect daughter…

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:31.135
…and now you're doing it again,
all for your father's honor

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:17.852
Wait!

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:19.980
Wait a moment!

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:21.648
What's going on?

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:25.454
I read the letter. I know

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.924
Wil, quiet! You're causing a scene!

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.461
You know what? What letter?

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:33.929
Don't marry him!

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.601
Marry the one you love

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:38.669
Wait a minute

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:40.870
You don't love me?

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.337
Of course she loves you!

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.340
Say it! You love him!

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:45.838
No!

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.179
No, she doesn't

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.047
She loves him!

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:53.380
This is a mistake!
It’s not me! It’s not me!

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.781
- Yes, it is!
- No, it's not!

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:56.785
Wilhelmina!

01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:58.151
It’s me

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.223
Are you insane?

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.130
- That woman's karma kills husbands!
- Pa, I love her!

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.703
I told you to marry
the Hong Kong movie star!

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:14.575
At least she doesn't have kids!

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:17.973
- If you want a divorce, just say so!
- You want it!

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:21.410
- Idiot, I love you!
- Dog fart! I love you!

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:37.423
I am indebted to you…

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.431
…but I don't love you

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.406
I am so sorry

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.216
I can't

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:04.448
You have thrown away
a lifetime of my reputation!

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.559
Father, please

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.495
Fantastic! I’ll move back in with you

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:54.167
We'll need a bigger bed,
so the baby can sleep with me

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:57.708
Later, we'll block off the living room
for her crib and--

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:02.811
We really should repaint.
Rose beige would be nice

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:05.185
It would warm the place up nicely!

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.985
He's young

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.650
Handsome

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:45.450
He could have anyone

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:52.798
Today he loves me

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.235
Tomorrow, who knows?

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:04.742
I guess I needed him to declare it.
Not just to me, but to everyone

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:11.615
Besides, I’d never dated before

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.750
I may as well see what's out there

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.396
You know…

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.933
…that Vivian…

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.034
…she seems nice

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:44.451
You like her, don't you?

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:49.724
Stop the bus!

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:02.145
You're late as usual

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:21.059
Wil, it's been so long

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:24.669
Busy lately? Try some of this jerky

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.500
Yeah, it's been a busy spring

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:30.768
Well, a full belly conquers all

01:29:56.357 --> 01:29:58.450
So now will you let me move in?

01:29:58.659 --> 01:29:59.648
No way!

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.988
This is the first time
I’ve ever had my own place

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.323
You're gonna cramp my style

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.164
The world is getting too hard
to predict

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:09.927
It just keeps getting worse

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:23.943
Revolting!

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:26.847
Let's go

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.350
One more bite

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:57.906
Stop patting that side.
The baby will turn out lopsided

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:59.238
Don't be silly

01:32:03.951 --> 01:32:04.918
Well said!

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:13.022
The moment that girl is born,
I’m coming over every day

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:18.427
God knows how she'll turn out
if she's brought up by you two

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:24.099
Nice shirt, Vivian

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:27.840
Now why can't you wear
something pleasant like that?

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:36.408
So there's only one thing left

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:39.486
When are you going to have a baby?

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:46.881
