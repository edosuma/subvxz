Well, I'm actually the only harpist,

10:06.314 --> 10:08.608
but the harp
is a difficult instrument to master--

10:08.691 --> 10:11.527
That's great, Devi.
Thanks for stopping by.

10:12.194 --> 10:15.406
Oh. Is that it? You don't wanna ask
any questions about myself?

10:15.489 --> 10:18.284
Nope, I think I understand you
pretty well already.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.162
Oh…

10:21.245 --> 10:22.246
Um…

10:22.330 --> 10:23.289
You know what?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.917
O-On second thought,
I am gonna go to the back of the line.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.045
And maybe we could start over
when I get to you?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.130
Not necessary. Have a great day.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.635
So these are the packages
I was talking about earlier…

10:36.177 --> 10:39.013
[McEnroe] Hold on.
What the hell just happened?

10:39.096 --> 10:41.849
Did Devi just screw up
her chance at Princeton?

10:43.976 --> 10:46.812
That's why Columbia
should be all about the Benjamin.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.232
[McEnroe] Speaking of people
who are shitting the bed at this fair…

10:50.316 --> 10:52.318
[tense music playing]

10:53.736 --> 10:55.279
[exhales]

10:57.406 --> 10:58.991
[McEnroe] God, look at him.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.785
He's making me feel stressed,

11:00.868 --> 11:03.245
and I'm sitting in a bath right now.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.163
[sighs]

11:04.872 --> 11:05.998
[sighs]

11:06.082 --> 11:09.293
Yo, Devi, what are you doing? Aren't you
supposed to be at your dork conference?

11:09.377 --> 11:11.295
Nope. Because I blew it.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.755
[sighs] The rep hated me.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.423
What? That bitch.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.092
Listen,

11:17.551 --> 11:20.680
do you want me to slash her tires
or, you know, key her car?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.431
No, please don't.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.142
Agh! I think I just came in too hot.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.353
Yeah, you did.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.855
Okay, I appreciate
how you made that sound sexy,

11:29.939 --> 11:32.191
but I really need to figure out
how I'm gonna fix this.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.861
Okay. Here's what you have to do.
So you follow her to her car.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.864
And then when she starts to back up,
you let her run you over just a bit.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.741
She'll feel bad
and give you whatever you want.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.910
What? Does that actually work?

11:42.993 --> 11:45.371
Yeah. How do you think
I haven't been expelled yet?

11:45.454 --> 11:47.289
-I get run over, like, once a week.
-Huh.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.251
Okay, so do I need to put, like,
fake blood on myself, or…?

11:50.334 --> 11:52.837
-Oh damn.
-Uh-- No, no, I'm not gonna do that.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.257
And honestly, Ethan,
you gotta stop messing with people's cars.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.343
[exhales]

11:59.427 --> 12:01.011
So, what are you gonna do?

12:01.095 --> 12:04.724
[inhales deeply] I don't need a scheme.
I'm just gonna show her who I really am.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.185
A mature young woman
filled with grace and dignity.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.813
Please, please, please
let me have another chance.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.275
Actually, we have a lunch break now,
so I'm gonna head to the lunchroom.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.111
Oh, yeah, please, I just-- I feel like
I really misrepresented myself,

12:17.194 --> 12:20.197
and I… I just thought I needed to say
everything that I'm good at,

12:20.281 --> 12:22.450
which I realize now is very unlikable.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.786
I'm glad you realize that.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.788
[sighs] I just--

12:28.372 --> 12:31.167
I've really wanted to go to Princeton
ever since I was a little girl,

12:31.250 --> 12:34.170
and I guess the pressure got to me.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.673
All right, I'll give you 15 minutes,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.760
but I want one of those
California grain bowls you guys do here.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.678
Yeah, yeah, coming right up.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.764
[pleasant music playing]

12:45.306 --> 12:48.225
It's kind of cool living with
three generations of women in my house.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.645
Yeah, Indian families definitely
do not believe in nursing homes.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.774
My grandmother shared a bunk bed with me
all through high school.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.526
Damn. Pati is way too much
of a diva for that.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.819
She demands a Cali king.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.279
-[laughs]
-[Ethan] Hey, hey.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.238
Uh-- Ethan?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.741
You must be the Princeton lady?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.868
Yes, I am. And you are?

13:05.951 --> 13:09.497
[McEnroe] Oh no. What's this
beautiful bonehead about to do?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.373
Is he gonna graffiti her face?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.834
I'm Ethan, Devi's boyfriend,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.545
and I just wanted to emphasize
what a sick student she is.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.341
She's literally
the smartest person I've ever met. Um…

13:20.841 --> 13:23.594
This is the honor roll list.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.597
I took it off the wall
of the principal's office.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.723
She's at the top of it.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.267
And this is, like, a crazy huge school,

13:30.351 --> 13:34.647
so you should let her
into your college or whatever.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.691
Wow. Impressive, Devi.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.026
[McEnroe] Oh my God.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.945
Was Devi's renegade romp partner

13:41.028 --> 13:44.073
actually being helpful to her
academically?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.534
Take that Fab, El, and Ms. Dubs.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.953
Thank you, Ethan. That was really nice.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.164
Don't worry about it.
Just want to hype my girl up.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.083
See you later, okay?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.042
Okay.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.547
I had a boyfriend like him in high school.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.298
Make sure to enjoy it

14:01.382 --> 14:04.468
because there truly are none of those
in Ivy League schools.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.136
Hmm.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.138
[inhales]

14:08.722 --> 14:09.598
[exhales]

14:12.685 --> 14:15.479
[exhales] Pati,
how long have I been asleep?

14:15.563 --> 14:16.897
[Len] About three hours.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.692
Len? Where's my grandmother?

14:19.775 --> 14:23.529
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to startle you,
but she went out to run some errands,

14:23.612 --> 14:27.074
so she asked me to keep an eye on you,
and here I am.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.242
-[scoffs]
-[phone vibrating]

14:29.285 --> 14:30.661
Oh, look, it's Nirmy.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.787
Oh, give me that.

14:33.831 --> 14:34.957
Excuse me.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.375
-Yeah.
-[Kamala sighs]

14:37.001 --> 14:38.127
Pati, where are you?

14:38.210 --> 14:41.839
I'm picking up groceries
so I can make medu vadai, your favorite.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.008
However, I did get a little distracted

14:44.091 --> 14:46.385
by the Bollywood movie
playing in the store.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.095
Well, can you please come home now?

14:48.178 --> 14:49.138
Of course.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.266
As soon as the father approves
of his daughter marrying the lowly tutor.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.477
Oh, so you're just going to leave me here
with Len? I don't even know him.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.229
Give him a chance.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.981
Len is a great caretaker.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.733
Oh, but let me go.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.611
Ranveer is doing a shirtless dance.
I'll be home soon.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.653
[Kamala] What?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.655
Pati, that's going to take ten hours.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.573
Okay.

15:08.240 --> 15:13.412
Look, I know it's a little weird
that I'm here,

15:13.495 --> 15:14.872
but I gotta say,

15:14.955 --> 15:18.834
I am the king
of staying home during the day, weekdays,

15:18.918 --> 15:23.339
and we also have the holy grail
of playing hooky,

15:23.422 --> 15:25.966
and that is The Price Is Right.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.676
-[game show playing on TV]
-I can't see anything.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.054
You don't have to see the bid
on household items.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.555
You… You know your household items.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.934
You know what I'm good at?
Discount toiletries.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.729
All right, Len,
I see that you do have some skills.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.357
-[Len] Mm-hmm.
-Please hand me the saltiest snack.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.983
That would be the popcorn.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.278
-You want me to hold it for you?
-Yes, please.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.279
Okay.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.948
[Ben exhaling]

15:51.075 --> 15:52.743
Hey. How did it go?

15:52.826 --> 15:55.496
Did Columbia offer you admission
right there on the spot?

15:55.579 --> 15:56.872
I haven't talked to them yet.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.708
Uh, the line was too long.
I'm just gonna wait till after lunch.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.461
Are you okay?
Why are you sweating so much?

16:02.544 --> 16:04.672
I don't know.
I've been practicing my speech for weeks,

16:04.755 --> 16:06.256
and I was waiting in line,

16:06.340 --> 16:08.342
and it just started to feel
a little hard to breathe.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.302
I think you're just panicking
a little bit.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.428
Oh God.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.431
Here, why don't you do your speech for me?
Maybe that'll help you loosen up.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.309
Yeah, okay.
But, uh, promise you won't be judgy.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.771
-I'm not gonna be judgy. Just go for it.
-All right. [clears throat]

16:21.605 --> 16:25.025
Power, leadership, innovation, domination.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.695
You're getting the full package
when you admit me.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.490
And that's why Columbia
should be all about the Benjamin.

16:32.658 --> 16:36.286
Okay, that was… good.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.788
I knew it. You're judging.

16:37.871 --> 16:38.998
Yes, I am,

16:39.081 --> 16:42.376
but only because that felt like…
a Bowflex commercial.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.293
What?

16:43.377 --> 16:46.547
Why don't you try a version that sounds
more like you, or is more conversational?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.257
Criticism is not what I need right now.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.174
[Margot] Don't…

16:50.300 --> 16:51.135
go…

16:51.218 --> 16:52.761
Oh shit.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.762
[Margot] Um…

16:54.638 --> 16:56.640
Here, here, let me try and wipe it off.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.934
-Uh… Ooh, that's--
-Oh… Oh…

16:59.018 --> 17:00.728
-Margot, just stop.
-[Margot] Uh--

17:01.353 --> 17:03.230
Goddamn it. Oh.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.279
Shit, shit, shit. Okay, come on.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.781
What the hell happened to you?

17:13.574 --> 17:14.867
Don't worry about it.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.869
Well, I hope you got to talk
to the Columbia rep

17:16.952 --> 17:18.704
before you stabbed a minion.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.248
-I haven't talked to the Columbia rep yet.
-What?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.917
-But you can't talk to him like that.
-I know that, Devi.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.339
Ah, damn it. I don't have
one backup cable knit in here?

17:29.423 --> 17:32.051
-I actually do think I've got a--
-Devi, just walk away.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.094
How many times do I tell you
Margot doesn't want--

17:34.178 --> 17:35.763
Want us to talk? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.474
I already know that was your decision.
I overheard you guys.

17:39.308 --> 17:43.771
Listen… I'm just trying to say
I have an extra shirt.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.355
Yeah, hard pass.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.273
[clicks tongue]

17:46.774 --> 17:48.275
Just come with me.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.320
[pleasant song playing]

17:51.403 --> 17:53.906
All right, you seem like a women's medium.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.700
Take off your shirt.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.535
What? Oh, okay.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.666
Put this on.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.509
Never thought I'd be grateful
you're built like a shot-putter.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.970
Um, please, I'm a snatched-waist
slim-thicc queen,

18:17.054 --> 18:18.472
And so are you, apparently.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.189
Okay.
Well, this actually looks pretty good.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.607
Mmm.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.234
But listen--

18:30.317 --> 18:32.402
[sighs] Yeah, yeah,
we're still not friends. I get it.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.612
Now, go talk to Columbia.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.074
[door opens]

18:39.243 --> 18:41.745
[sighs] Okay,
I talked to Harvard and Yale.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.747
I just need to grab
a brochure from Princeton

18:43.831 --> 18:46.500
so my mom will get off my flipping case.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.835
Sorry to use the F-word.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.546
Devi's done, so you're good to grab.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.840
Cool. Are you talking to any colleges?

18:52.923 --> 18:56.135
[scoffs] No, I'm only applying
to acting conservatories.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.471
I'm not a liberal arts person.
I'm a one-art person.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.557
I'm only here to study regional accents.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.017
[gasps] Ooh, University of Iowa. BRB!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.437
Hi. What's your name?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.648
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I'm just grabbing a brochure.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.942
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.153
Wait, are you on the robotics team,

19:14.236 --> 19:17.698
or is that, like, an ironic shirt,
and I am just proving how old I am?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.284
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm actually the captain.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.744
Really? Is that something
you wanna study in college?

19:22.828 --> 19:23.871
Robotics?

19:24.371 --> 19:25.998
Yes, it's my passion.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.292
One of my best friends
is actually a robot.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.878
Probably shouldn't have
said that out loud.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.089
Well, Princeton
has a phenomenal robotics team.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.134
They're building Micromouse maze-solvers
autonomous drones,

19:37.217 --> 19:39.636
and, sorry to geek out,
but this year they're building

19:39.720 --> 19:41.972
a fully functioning BB-8 droid,
like from--

19:42.055 --> 19:44.016
-The Force Awakens?
-Hmm.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.518
Yeah, I'd say we have the best program
in the Ivy League.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.605
Here's my email if you have any questions.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.106
Oh wow, thank you.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.567
Mm-hmm. No problem.
I didn't get your name.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.736
Uh, it's Fabiola Torres.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.538
-Hello. Can I help you?
-What?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.123
N-No, this isn't my shirt.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.459
-Excuse me?
-Uh, sorry. No, nothing.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.252
I just-- I had to borrow a girl's shirt.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.255
I don't know why I'm telling you that.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.299
-Um, hi, I'm Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.927
Did you sweat through the first shirt?
Happens all the time at these things.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.055
No, um, I actually got a bunch of paint
on myself when I was…

20:24.181 --> 20:25.974
practicing what I was gonna say to you.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.519
Ah. Well, then I think
that paint did you a favor.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.980
I hate when kids come to me
with rehearsed spiel.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.275
I'd much rather talk to someone
who's just being themself.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.695
Really? 'Cause normally,
I don't trust my natural personality.

20:38.779 --> 20:39.613
[laughs]

20:40.155 --> 20:42.824
You seem okay to me, bud.
So why don't you tell me about yourself?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.160
Okay.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.788
Um, well, I'm really involved
at Sherman Oaks.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.873
I've been wanting to go to Columbia
my whole life.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.251
[breathing heavily]

20:52.334 --> 20:55.629
You were so freaking amazing.
You made me look so good.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.256
-You always look so good.
-[laughs]

20:57.339 --> 20:59.132
I feel like
I could really get in, you know?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.425
[Ethan] Mmm…

21:00.509 --> 21:02.427
I mean, I'm basically best friends with--

21:03.136 --> 21:04.346
[bag thuds]

21:04.972 --> 21:06.265
[suspicious music plays]

21:06.348 --> 21:07.182
Akshara?

21:11.019 --> 21:13.647
Ethan, why do you have Akshara's wallet?

21:14.648 --> 21:15.524
Because I stole it.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.610
You robbed the Princeton rep?
Are you insane?

21:18.694 --> 21:21.113
She was a bitch.
And she deserved it for icing you out.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.572
Plus, there's some cash in there.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.117
We could do a lot of damage
at Romano's Macaroni Grill.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.036
How could you go into someone's purse
and steal their wallet?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.789
Well, it was actually pretty easy
because it wasn't really a purse.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.833
It was more of a tote
without a zipper or anything.

21:32.916 --> 21:36.586
[sighs] Oh my God, you are a dirtbag.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.629
What?

21:38.213 --> 21:42.467
You're not a bad boy,
you're just a bad person.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.969
That's a little harsh.

21:44.052 --> 21:47.806
Ethan, thank you so much
for this incredible sexual awakening,

21:47.889 --> 21:50.684
but I think I'm now having
a moral awakening.

21:51.518 --> 21:54.271
I need to be with someone
who knows right from wrong,

21:54.354 --> 21:56.064
and that doesn't seem to be you.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.525
So you're dumping me?

21:58.608 --> 21:59.860
[sighs]

21:59.943 --> 22:01.945
[smacking lips] Oh, sweet Ethan.

22:04.031 --> 22:04.865
Goodbye.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.250
[McEnroe] Devi, do not knock on that door.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.545
Just leave the wallet
in that potted fern and run.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.547
She's gonna think you're a psycho.

22:21.048 --> 22:21.965
Mmm.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.136
[exhales]

22:28.764 --> 22:29.639
Devi?

22:30.640 --> 22:31.933
Why are you at my hotel?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.226
Hi. Um…

22:34.061 --> 22:35.020
I have your wallet.

22:35.103 --> 22:35.937
Oh.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.108
I've been looking everywhere for this.
Thank you so much. Where did you find it?

22:40.192 --> 22:41.568
Funny story. [chuckles]

22:41.651 --> 22:44.696
Remember that handsome kid
that was formerly my boyfriend?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.366
[inhales deeply] Well, he stole it.

22:47.991 --> 22:48.825
Oh.

22:49.868 --> 22:53.205
-Wow.
-Yeah. Turns out he's kind of the worst.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.206
[scoffs]

22:54.289 --> 22:59.044
Anyway, I'm really sorry
about almost all of our interactions.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.838
I would understand
if this is a deal-breaker.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.925
-Can I ask you a question?
-Mm-hmm.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.551
Why admit this to me?

23:06.635 --> 23:09.304
You could've just tossed it
in that potted fern over there and run.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.680
Yeah, I know,

23:11.306 --> 23:13.392
but it felt like the right thing to do.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.727
Mmm. Well, I appreciate your honesty.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.981
It was brave bringing this back to me
not knowing if I was gonna press charges.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.234
Oh my God, was that on the table?

23:22.317 --> 23:23.276
I was joking.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.528
[chuckles nervously]

23:24.611 --> 23:27.697
You're a good kid, Devi. I think
you have a bright future ahead of you.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.201
As long as you stop dating thieves.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.078
Yep, I can do that.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.163
[uplifting music playing]

23:35.789 --> 23:36.706
Huh.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.668
[Shrimp] Yeah, I got it. Money.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.962
Money. Oh my God.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.797
[laughs]

23:43.880 --> 23:47.509
Yo, what's up, Mad Pax?
Why you look all Fury Road?

23:47.592 --> 23:49.219
Trent, can I ask you a question?

23:50.887 --> 23:52.180
Am I a loser now?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.515
What?

23:53.598 --> 23:56.059
Don't you dare talk about
my best baby boy like that.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.311
Those little punks used to worship me.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.397
Now they're talking shit
straight to my face.

24:00.981 --> 24:05.402
I don't know if you remember this,
but you're Paxton Hall-Yo-goddamn-shida.

24:05.485 --> 24:08.572
You are the king of this jungle, baby.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.991
You're a legend,
you're a handsome son of a bitch,

24:11.575 --> 24:13.118
and you're that guy.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.369
-Yeah.
-[Trent] Yeah.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.290
Sometimes, I'm brushing my teeth at night.
I can't even believe we're best friends.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.209
And if you want their respect,
you have to go in there

24:21.293 --> 24:23.462
and make them remember who the alpha is.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.964
-That's what I'm talking about.
-That's what I'm talking about.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.132
I gotta go to class.

24:27.757 --> 24:29.259
-[Shrimp] You're close.
-Yo, Shrimp.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.428
Hey.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.347
That little ASU joke back there
was pretty funny, huh?

24:34.931 --> 24:37.434
Yeah, remember?
Everyone who heard it laughed. [laughs]

24:37.517 --> 24:39.686
-Yeah, man, yeah.
-[both laugh]

24:41.146 --> 24:43.190
If you ever speak to me like that again,

24:43.690 --> 24:46.318
I'll give you Saturday detention
for the rest of the year.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.736
[scoffs] Wait, what?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.905
And I'll make your lunch period 9 a.m.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.907
But I'll still be full from breakfast.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.784
See, bro, I think you forget
who you're talking to.

24:54.868 --> 25:00.499
And now I have the power
and the parking spot of a faculty member.

25:01.208 --> 25:05.212
See, I can make your life miserable
if I want to.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.506
So show some respect.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.091
Look, I'm…
I'm really sorry, Paxton, all right?

25:10.175 --> 25:11.551
Please don't be mad at me. I…

25:11.635 --> 25:13.345
You-- You look really handsome.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.014
Red is totally your color, man.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.099
[upbeat music playing]

25:19.518 --> 25:20.519
[gasps]

25:21.394 --> 25:23.396
[indistinct chatter]

25:26.274 --> 25:27.192

[indistinct chatter continues]

25:32.113 --> 25:33.198
Pati, is that you?

25:33.782 --> 25:36.618
[Len] Look, I can't talk about this
right now. There's somebody here.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.871
-Hello?
-[woman] Whatever, sweetie, I'll call you.

25:42.123 --> 25:42.999
[door closes]

25:43.083 --> 25:45.544
Oh. Look who's up from the couch.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.172
-Was there someone else here?
-Nope, just good old Len.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.883
Your grandma should be home
in about ten minutes.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.344
Oh! Come on.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.973
Let's get you back to the couch
before you ruin your brand-new corneas.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.475
But I heard somebody.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.979
Oh, the neighbors love to talk and loud.

26:04.771 --> 26:06.898
[McEnroe]
In Devi's attempt to have it all,

26:06.982 --> 26:09.985
she nearly lost the thing
she cared about most.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.530
Yes, she did care about
having a fulfilling sex life,

26:13.613 --> 26:15.615
but not at the cost of her future.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.158
And speaking of future,

26:17.242 --> 26:20.245
it was beginning right now
for her and all the other kids

26:20.328 --> 26:22.872
submitting early-decision applications.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.083
After all, for dorks like these kids…

26:25.166 --> 26:26.126
Swoosh, baby.

26:26.209 --> 26:28.420
…college is where your life really starts.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.338
I am so proud of you, honey.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.215
You're gonna be glad you did this.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.301
I really hope so.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.553
[McEnroe] Unless, of course,

26:37.470 --> 26:39.889
there's a Judas-sized obstacle
in your path.
