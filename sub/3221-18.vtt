WEBVTT

00:03.757 --> 00:06.007
- I don't believe it.
- Wyoming? What does that mean?

00:06.493 --> 00:08.833
Each of these X's
is an abandoned frontier church.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.670
All mid-19th century,
built by Samuel Colt.

00:12.166 --> 00:14.476
Samuel Colt. The demon-killing,
gun-making Samuel Colt?

00:14.969 --> 00:19.279
Yep. He built private railway lines
connecting church to church.

00:20.407 --> 00:23.807
It just happens to lay out like this.

00:24.445 --> 00:27.055
- It's a devil's trap.
- A hundred-square-mile devil's trap.

00:30.351 --> 00:32.811
- 1973. What is this?
- What does it look like?

00:33.320 --> 00:34.580
- Is it real?
- Very.

00:34.922 --> 00:36.792
So angels got their hands
on some DeLoreans?

00:37.224 --> 00:40.184
- How did I get here?
- Time is fluid, Dean.

00:40.794 --> 00:42.544
Not easy,
but we can bend it on occasion.

00:43.030 --> 00:44.260
I'm thinking purgatory.

00:44.598 --> 00:47.208
This is all about opening a door
to let something in.

00:47.735 --> 00:48.845
- What?
- I'm working on it.

00:49.169 --> 00:51.719
- Could you give us something?
- I got a name: Mother of All.

00:52.239 --> 00:53.409
We got zero on ganking her.

00:53.741 --> 00:56.841
- We have so much to do.
- Let's get started.

01:03.450 --> 01:04.970
She has a message for you.

01:05.352 --> 01:06.252
Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:06.553 --> 01:07.863
You're all gonna die.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.960
- Look, it's here somewhere.
- Help me move this.

02:38.345 --> 02:40.045
Well, I'll be damned.

02:47.154 --> 02:49.584
Welcome to the Campbell
family library.

03:01.201 --> 03:03.921
- So Samuel collected all this stuff, huh?
- Apparently.

03:04.638 --> 03:05.568
Well.

03:06.673 --> 03:09.453
- What are we looking for?
- Well, anything that'll put a run...

03:10.010 --> 03:12.590
- in the Octomom's stockings.
- Pick a row.

03:30.831 --> 03:32.061
Bingo.

03:34.735 --> 03:37.395
Either of you jokers ever heard anything
about a phoenix?

03:37.971 --> 03:40.521
River, Joaquin
or the giant flaming bird?

03:41.041 --> 03:44.671
It says here that the ashes of a phoenix
can burn the mother.

03:46.046 --> 03:47.536
The mother?

03:48.048 --> 03:51.008
- Great. Where do we get one?
- You got me. I thought it was a myth.

03:52.519 --> 03:56.559
Great. Well, let's see if we can
find something out about a phoenix.

04:15.309 --> 04:19.699
Guys. Guys, guys, guys,
check this out.

04:20.514 --> 04:22.824
"March 5th, 1861.

04:23.317 --> 04:26.067
Sunrise, Wyoming.
Gun killed a phoenix today.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.290
Left a pile of smoldering ash."

04:30.624 --> 04:32.024
Really? Whose gun?

04:33.227 --> 04:35.127
- Colt's.
- Colt? Colt like...

04:35.562 --> 04:36.582
Like the Colt.

04:37.464 --> 04:38.924
From...

04:41.268 --> 04:43.488
Samuel Colt's Journal.

04:45.105 --> 04:46.565
What?

04:46.940 --> 04:47.990
- That's his?
- Yeah.

04:48.308 --> 04:50.008
- Dude, no.
- Dude, yes.

04:50.577 --> 04:52.217
- Well, let me see...
- Get your own.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.170
What else about the phoenix?
What does it look like?

04:55.649 --> 04:58.309
- Has it got feathers?
- It just says phoenix.

04:58.852 --> 05:00.722
- Did he say where he tracked it?
- No.

05:01.421 --> 05:04.171
All right. I guess we gotta find
one of our own. Whatever it is.

05:07.127 --> 05:09.057
I know where we can find one.

05:12.266 --> 05:16.136
<i>March 5th, 1861, Sunrise, Wyoming.
We'll Star Trek IV this bitch.</i>

05:18.939 --> 05:20.609
<i>I only watched Deep Space Nine.</i>

05:23.710 --> 05:25.670
It's like I don't even
know you guys anymore.

05:26.113 --> 05:28.073
<i>Star Trek IV, save the whales.</i>

05:30.484 --> 05:33.524
We hop back in time, join up
with Samuel Colt, hunt the phoenix...

05:34.121 --> 05:36.731
and then we haul the ashes
back home with us.

05:37.891 --> 05:38.851
- Time travel?
- Yeah.

05:39.159 --> 05:41.769
- That's a reasonable plan?
- We got a guy who can swing it.

05:47.401 --> 05:49.241
Castiel...

05:49.703 --> 05:52.863
the, uh, fate of the world
is in the balance...

05:53.674 --> 05:54.874
so come on down here.

05:58.178 --> 06:01.278
<i>Come on, Cass. I Dream of Jeannie
your ass down here, pronto.</i>

06:01.882 --> 06:03.142
Please.

06:07.421 --> 06:08.561
Jeannie?

06:08.889 --> 06:10.149
Rachel.

06:10.490 --> 06:12.920
I understand you need some assistance.
How can I help you?

06:15.028 --> 06:18.128
Well, uh, we kind of need to talk
to the big kahuna.

06:18.899 --> 06:20.209
I'm here on Castiel's behalf.

06:20.901 --> 06:22.421
- Well, where's he?
- Busy.

06:23.403 --> 06:24.423
- Busy?
- Yes.

06:25.072 --> 06:27.942
Well, we've got a line on the mother
of freaking everything, so...

06:28.508 --> 06:30.348
I'm sure your issue is very important...

06:30.777 --> 06:33.387
but Castiel is currently
commanding an army, so...

06:33.914 --> 06:37.134
- So we get stuck with Miss Moneypenny.
- So you need to learn your place.

06:37.751 --> 06:39.391
I don't know who you think you are...

06:39.786 --> 06:41.216
- His friend.
- You think we're not?

06:41.588 --> 06:44.078
I think you call him
when you need something.

06:45.759 --> 06:46.929
We're fighting a war.

06:47.261 --> 06:49.011
- We get that.
- Clearly you don't...

06:49.429 --> 06:52.179
or you wouldn't call him
every time you stub your toe...

06:52.733 --> 06:55.223
- you petty, entitled little piece...
- Rachel.

06:59.473 --> 07:00.553
That's enough.

07:02.876 --> 07:05.716
- I told you I'd take care of this.
- It's all right, you can go.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.390
- You're staying?
- Go.

07:09.116 --> 07:10.376
I'll come when I can.

07:14.788 --> 07:15.868
Wow.

07:16.390 --> 07:19.520
- Friend of yours?
- Yes. She's, uh, my lieutenant.

07:20.127 --> 07:23.087
She's committed to the cause.

07:24.331 --> 07:25.881
Now, what do you need?

07:28.268 --> 07:29.848
Where the hell's Dean?

07:30.237 --> 07:32.457
Supply run, he said. I don't know.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.519
Um, about your plan...

07:35.309 --> 07:36.739
You'll only have 24 hours.

07:37.978 --> 07:39.268
What?

07:39.746 --> 07:40.676
Why?

07:40.981 --> 07:43.941
Well, the answer to your question
can best be expressed as a series...

07:44.518 --> 07:46.858
- of partial differential equations.
- Yeah.

07:47.354 --> 07:48.904
Aim lower.

07:50.791 --> 07:54.271
The further back I send you,
the harder it becomes to retrieve you.

07:54.928 --> 07:58.438
Twenty-four hours is all I can risk. If I
don't pull you home within that time...

07:59.099 --> 08:00.359
you'll be lost to me.

08:01.435 --> 08:03.895
Well, then we better get you a watch.

08:05.305 --> 08:06.475
What the hell's all that?

08:08.508 --> 08:09.468
We are going native.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.370
Gotta blend in.

08:13.413 --> 08:14.963
- Uh, ha, ha. No, thanks. I'm fine.
- Sam.

08:15.349 --> 08:17.189
- Dean, I can wear this.
- Like a spaceman?

08:17.617 --> 08:19.547
Just because you're obsessed
with Wild West...

08:19.986 --> 08:21.296
- I'm not.
- You have a fetish.

08:21.655 --> 08:22.825
Shut up. I like old movies.

08:23.156 --> 08:25.406
You can recite
every Clint Eastwood movie ever made.

08:25.892 --> 08:28.202
- Even the monkey movies?
- Especially the monkey movies.

08:28.695 --> 08:29.715
His name is Clyde.

08:32.265 --> 08:33.965
At least wear the damn shirt.

08:40.340 --> 08:43.620
Dean, this is stupid. I look stupid.

08:47.714 --> 08:51.114
- You're going to a hoedown?
- Now, is it customary to wear a blanket?

08:52.152 --> 08:53.382
It's a serape.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.030
And, yes. It's, uh...

08:57.991 --> 08:59.071
Never mind. Let's just go.

09:00.827 --> 09:01.727
What's this?

09:02.028 --> 09:04.078
Where you're going
they don't take plastic.

09:07.367 --> 09:10.587
I'll send you back to March 4th.
That should give you time to find the Colt.

09:12.806 --> 09:14.236
And this phoenix creature.

09:14.741 --> 09:18.811
All right, well,
see you at high noon tomorrow...

09:19.546 --> 09:20.776
partner.

09:32.092 --> 09:34.312
Oh, now we're talking.

09:35.629 --> 09:37.769
- I have to go.
- What about getting the boys back?

09:38.231 --> 09:40.101
Pray for me in 24 hours
and I'll return.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.634
I'll pray for all of us.

09:48.074 --> 09:51.474
All right, let's go find Samuel Colt.
Hey, we should try the saloon first...

09:52.112 --> 09:53.722
to see what we get from the locals.

09:54.114 --> 09:55.404
Sure. Whatever, Sundance.

09:55.749 --> 09:57.799
Think we'll have time
to hit on the saloon girls?

09:59.286 --> 10:01.066
Kidding. Come on.

10:02.989 --> 10:05.599
Oh, damn it. Come on.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.200
You know what that is?

10:08.562 --> 10:10.262
- Yeah. It's horse...
- Authenticity.

10:21.074 --> 10:22.414
<i>We stand here today...</i>

10:22.776 --> 10:24.706
March the 4th, 1861...

10:25.412 --> 10:29.132
to execute justice upon Elias Finch...

10:29.983 --> 10:32.033
for the murder of his own wife.

10:33.420 --> 10:35.230
Wow, talk about authenticity.

10:35.655 --> 10:38.615
Sentence handed down by myself,
Tye Mortimer...

10:39.192 --> 10:42.032
duly appointed judge
of the Wyoming Circuit.

10:43.697 --> 10:47.567
You will be hung by your neck
until you die.

10:48.835 --> 10:50.475
You got anything to say?

10:52.105 --> 10:53.505
You're gonna burn for this.

10:59.079 --> 11:00.449
Every one of you.

11:12.459 --> 11:14.099
Good times.

11:16.730 --> 11:19.480
- So where do we find Sammy Colt?
- No idea.

11:22.469 --> 11:23.369
Huh.

11:23.670 --> 11:24.810
I think I know who to ask.

11:31.444 --> 11:32.524
Nice blanket.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.697
Sheriff, can we have a word?

11:57.904 --> 11:58.894
Depends who's asking.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.832
Marshal Eastwood.

12:04.878 --> 12:06.308
Clint Eastwood.

12:10.383 --> 12:12.843
This here's, uh, Walker.

12:13.353 --> 12:14.283
He's a Texas ranger.

12:17.257 --> 12:18.837
So, what can I do for you boys?

12:19.225 --> 12:20.275
We're looking for a man.

12:21.027 --> 12:21.987
I'll bet.

12:23.997 --> 12:24.927
Nice shirt there.

12:26.032 --> 12:28.722
- What's wrong with my shirt?
- You're very clean.

12:33.607 --> 12:34.867
It's dirtier than it looks.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.608
We need to find Samuel Colt.
Do you know him?

12:38.111 --> 12:39.781
- The gun maker?
- Yeah. Is he in town?

12:40.880 --> 12:42.370
Not that I know of.

12:42.749 --> 12:44.679
Might try asking Elkins
over at the saloon.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.519
Been here longer than God.

13:11.745 --> 13:13.585
This is not awesome.

13:21.154 --> 13:22.904
- Hi.
- What'll you have?

13:23.323 --> 13:24.693
Oh, uh...

13:25.058 --> 13:27.578
Okay, great.
I'll have your top-shelf whiskey.

13:28.094 --> 13:30.024
Only have the one shelf.

13:31.197 --> 13:33.307
That'll do just fine.
He'll have a sarsaparilla.

13:41.074 --> 13:42.004
Are you Elkins?

13:42.776 --> 13:43.706
One and only.

13:45.178 --> 13:46.518
Know a man named Samuel Colt?

13:48.381 --> 13:50.311
He passed through here
about four years ago.

13:51.851 --> 13:54.951
- He still around?
- Rumor is he's building a railroad stop...

13:55.588 --> 13:58.488
20 miles out of town,
just by the postal road.

13:59.359 --> 14:00.319
Middle of nowhere.

14:01.461 --> 14:02.391
The Devil's Gate?

14:02.862 --> 14:03.942
Location fits.

14:05.565 --> 14:07.315
Howdy, boys.

14:10.503 --> 14:12.433
Darla's my best girl.

14:17.811 --> 14:19.301
Try me.

14:20.313 --> 14:21.453
You want a kiss?

14:21.781 --> 14:23.301
Ugh, ooh.

14:23.683 --> 14:25.583
It's so much more germier
than I pictured.

14:29.656 --> 14:30.856
Darla.

14:32.225 --> 14:33.805
Judge.

14:36.329 --> 14:37.289
Nice to see you.

14:37.831 --> 14:39.581
I thought we had a date.

14:55.448 --> 14:57.758
- That was a close one.
- I guess it's good to be judge.

14:58.852 --> 15:00.052
Yeah.

15:02.155 --> 15:03.555
Oh! It's like gasoline.

15:05.191 --> 15:06.421
Sarsaparilla ain't half bad.

15:49.469 --> 15:51.519
- You okay, sheriff?
- Of course I'm okay.

15:51.971 --> 15:54.371
- It was a ghost.
- It wasn't a ghost.

15:54.874 --> 15:57.014
Unless ghosts leave footprints.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.550
I am telling you Elias Finch was here.

16:03.716 --> 16:05.006
He did that...

16:05.485 --> 16:07.215
and then he walked out that door.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.990
Rope didn't kill him. Seen it before.

16:10.490 --> 16:13.710
- You got any idea where he could be?
- Could be a thousand places.

16:14.394 --> 16:16.124
Well, you got a way to flush him out?

16:16.796 --> 16:17.876
Of course.

16:18.198 --> 16:20.568
We're gonna form a posse
then string Finch up right.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.687
Put a bullet in his head
for good measure.

16:24.304 --> 16:27.404
- That actually sounds like a good plan.
- You two should come along.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.248
Meet downstairs at dawn.

16:30.643 --> 16:31.983
Yeah, we'll be there.

16:33.479 --> 16:35.969
Get yourselves
some real gear first, huh?

16:39.352 --> 16:41.902
Well, I think
we ought to pay our respects to Finch.

16:42.422 --> 16:43.822
I was thinking the same thing.

16:47.660 --> 16:48.830
Thinking what I'm thinking?

16:53.499 --> 16:55.929
Rose from the ashes,
burned up its victim?

16:56.569 --> 16:59.639
Maybe we're not looking for a bird.
Maybe the phoenix is walking around...

17:00.240 --> 17:01.940
- in cowboy boots.
- It makes sense.

17:02.342 --> 17:03.952
Could be Finch.

17:04.544 --> 17:07.444
So question is,
how do we put this thing out?

17:09.848 --> 17:11.809
We do know one thing
that'll kill anything.

17:12.719 --> 17:14.469
- Yeah, the Colt.
- So you go get the gun.

17:16.155 --> 17:18.704
But isn't the gun coming here?
According to Colt's journal?

17:19.659 --> 17:21.648
Yeah, but people here barely know
who Colt is.

17:22.095 --> 17:24.845
Maybe you gotta go find him
and make history.

17:25.397 --> 17:27.268
I'll stay here, hook up with the posse.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.810
Because you know me,
I'm a posse magnet.

17:31.204 --> 17:32.604
I mean, I love posse.

17:34.774 --> 17:36.034
Make that into a T-shirt.

17:36.709 --> 17:38.079
You done?

17:40.113 --> 17:42.573
Look, the problem is Colt's 20 miles
outside of town.

17:43.082 --> 17:45.602
How am I supposed to get there
and back before noon?

17:52.592 --> 17:53.552
Ride 'em, cowboy.

17:58.998 --> 18:00.368
Uh, try the other side.

18:03.836 --> 18:05.506
- Yeah. Good boy.
- Right. Yeah, right.

18:13.513 --> 18:14.883
Okay.

18:15.248 --> 18:17.438
- This actually feels all right.
- Just take it easy.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.177
Yeah, you bet. I'm good.

18:19.519 --> 18:21.189
- All right, 11 a.m.
- Don't be late.

18:21.587 --> 18:24.367
- Okay.
- All right. Go on. Go.

18:26.826 --> 18:27.996
I'm okay.

18:28.828 --> 18:30.118
That poor horse.

19:08.201 --> 19:10.451
- Forgive me. I'm sorry.
- You had your chance.

19:11.204 --> 19:12.254
Tell it to the judge.

19:26.319 --> 19:28.019
We need to talk.

19:28.421 --> 19:29.531
You summoned me here?

19:29.856 --> 19:31.726
Castiel, I've been hearing things.

19:34.327 --> 19:36.697
Things I don't wanna believe.

19:38.598 --> 19:39.738
Just tell me if it's true.

19:40.566 --> 19:43.316
- If what's true?
- You know.

19:44.103 --> 19:46.123
Your dirty little secret.

19:48.941 --> 19:51.521
- I have to defeat Raphael.
- Not this way, Castiel.

19:52.045 --> 19:55.085
- Rachel.
- We put our faith in you and...

19:56.849 --> 19:58.489
Look what you're turning into.

20:04.557 --> 20:05.577
I don't have a choice.

20:06.192 --> 20:07.122
Then neither do I.

20:56.075 --> 20:57.745
I'm sorry.

21:13.426 --> 21:14.356
What the hell?

21:18.131 --> 21:19.361
Cass?

21:37.717 --> 21:38.827
Cass?

21:40.620 --> 21:41.880
Are we running or fighting?

21:42.655 --> 21:43.885
We're...

21:46.959 --> 21:47.919
Balls.

22:06.546 --> 22:07.596
New hat.

22:09.348 --> 22:10.398
I look good.

22:12.218 --> 22:13.648
Where's the posse?

22:15.454 --> 22:16.414
I must be early.

22:16.722 --> 22:19.502
Ha. Or you're the only greenhorn
dumb enough...

22:20.059 --> 22:21.669
to go chasing after a ghost.

22:22.061 --> 22:24.281
What? Sheriff's tough as nails.
He'll be here.

22:24.764 --> 22:27.664
Oh, God! The sheriff's dead!

22:30.970 --> 22:32.490
Or not.

22:36.842 --> 22:38.102
Great.

22:38.744 --> 22:39.704
Who's the sheriff now?

22:48.020 --> 22:50.710
- Wait, what?
- Well...

22:52.124 --> 22:53.584
congratulations, sheriff.

23:16.349 --> 23:17.279
Samuel Colt?

23:18.951 --> 23:21.351
You have the wrong drunk, gentlemen.

23:21.854 --> 23:22.784
Have a nice day.

23:23.089 --> 23:24.259
We've been looking for you.

23:25.958 --> 23:27.128
And who might "we" be?

23:32.365 --> 23:33.765
Listen...

23:34.267 --> 23:36.437
I've long since hung it up.

23:36.902 --> 23:40.332
I'm tired and I'm too old for this. I'm
sure as hell not looking for any trouble.

23:40.973 --> 23:42.993
Well, it's found you anyway.

23:43.843 --> 23:47.123
We know you built that Devil's Gate.
So you're gonna open it for us.

23:47.747 --> 23:50.557
That is if you fancy keeping your lungs
in your chest.

23:55.288 --> 23:56.748
Walk away, gentlemen.

23:57.123 --> 23:59.263
I think we'd rather rip you to ribbons,
you soft...

24:05.931 --> 24:08.771
Aw, that's a shame.

24:09.468 --> 24:10.958
A damn shame.

24:17.510 --> 24:18.560
Who's there?

24:18.878 --> 24:20.988
Candygram for Mongo.

24:28.521 --> 24:30.041
Howdy, pilgrim.

24:30.423 --> 24:31.473
I ain't no pilgrim.

24:31.791 --> 24:32.811
All right, back up.

24:37.997 --> 24:39.667
Is that any way...

24:41.200 --> 24:43.040
to greet your new boss?

24:47.673 --> 24:49.453
Missed you at the posse this morning.

24:49.909 --> 24:52.719
I was a one-man wolf pack,
thanks to you.

24:54.914 --> 24:57.374
- What's going on here?
- Going to visit my sister.

24:58.184 --> 24:59.674
- She'll have to wait.
- If I don't...

25:00.052 --> 25:02.362
Finch said he was coming back
for the former sheriff...

25:04.423 --> 25:05.473
Judge Mortimer...

25:06.859 --> 25:07.819
and you.

25:09.295 --> 25:10.815
Now, that's two down and one to go.

25:11.197 --> 25:13.827
- Then just let me go.
- You really think you can outrun him?

25:14.367 --> 25:15.827
He's going to kill you.

25:16.202 --> 25:17.662
Unless...

25:20.239 --> 25:21.549
Unless what?

25:22.041 --> 25:23.241
Unless we gank him first.

25:23.576 --> 25:26.006
Gank? What's gank?

25:26.512 --> 25:28.732
Mister, you're crazy.
No way. You're on your own.

25:29.215 --> 25:32.115
I'm not asking you to throw down
with him. Play your part.

25:32.685 --> 25:35.145
- My part?
- Yeah. Bait.

25:47.733 --> 25:49.023
Hello?

26:01.180 --> 26:03.400
Okay, not a demon. Not a demon.
Just a hunter.

26:04.784 --> 26:06.974
- Sheesh.
- You're a what?

26:08.687 --> 26:09.707
You Samuel Colt?

26:12.191 --> 26:14.091
My name is Sam Winchester.

26:14.527 --> 26:17.687
I'm a hunter from the year 2011.

26:21.367 --> 26:22.387
Prove it.

26:33.779 --> 26:35.209
All right.

26:38.384 --> 26:39.314
All right?

26:39.618 --> 26:40.848
That's...

26:41.387 --> 26:42.617
That's it?

26:42.955 --> 26:45.915
Well, when you've done this job
as long as I have...

26:47.726 --> 26:49.976
a giant from the future
with some magic brick...

26:50.463 --> 26:52.713
doesn't exactly give you the vapors.

26:55.601 --> 26:57.821
I need your help killing a phoenix.

26:59.572 --> 27:00.652
A phoenix? They exist?

27:01.240 --> 27:03.080
Well, you shoot one
in about three hours.

27:04.310 --> 27:06.360
- If you say so.
- I don't.

27:07.780 --> 27:08.710
You do.

27:12.585 --> 27:13.785
That's...

27:16.789 --> 27:19.479
I'm either too drunk
or not drunk enough.

27:23.929 --> 27:25.569
So, what is it I'm about to exactly do?

27:26.632 --> 27:29.122
Well, the phoenix is in Sunrise.
Uh, if we leave now, you can...

27:29.635 --> 27:32.885
I appreciate your situation,
but I'm not gonna be of any help to you.

27:33.506 --> 27:35.846
- I'm booked.
- Right. But you say right here...

27:36.342 --> 27:38.362
Don't believe everything
that you read.

27:38.811 --> 27:39.831
But you're a hunter.

27:41.714 --> 27:43.584
- Retired.
- There's no such thing.

27:44.016 --> 27:46.356
- I'm out.
- There's no getting out.

27:46.852 --> 27:50.012
Look, for what it's worth,
in my time, you're a hero.

27:50.823 --> 27:51.903
- Me?
- Yes, sir.

27:53.425 --> 27:55.565
Now, look,
we need to kill this phoenix.

27:56.028 --> 27:58.898
Its ashes are the only thing
that can kill the monster I'm hunting.

27:59.665 --> 28:02.185
So stow your crap for a few hours
and let's go.

28:04.870 --> 28:05.800
We gotta go now.

28:06.105 --> 28:08.505
So either you're coming with me
or I need the gun.

28:09.909 --> 28:10.869
What gun?

28:11.377 --> 28:12.337
The gun.

28:13.379 --> 28:15.249
Oh, that gun.

28:16.015 --> 28:17.475
I lost it in a game of stud.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.490
- You're lying.
- Am I?

28:26.258 --> 28:27.628
Now, that doesn't sound like me.

28:27.993 --> 28:29.693
You shot demons with it an hour ago.

28:30.429 --> 28:31.419
How do you figure?

28:33.666 --> 28:36.796
Two pairs of boot prints.
Cabin reeks of sulfur.

28:38.504 --> 28:40.174
Not bad.

28:43.943 --> 28:45.343
You don't want it.

28:45.711 --> 28:48.781
- It's a curse. Believe me.
- Then let me take it off your hands.

28:49.682 --> 28:52.112
Go put on a few more miles
then come back and we'll talk.

28:52.918 --> 28:54.528
Trust me, I've got plenty of mileage.

28:55.154 --> 28:57.524
I'm doing you a favor. Believe me.

28:59.425 --> 29:01.175
So what? You can really just sit there?

29:05.598 --> 29:08.228
I've given my whole life to this.

29:08.934 --> 29:10.574
- I'm done.
- Doesn't matter what happens?

29:10.970 --> 29:13.900
- No, it doesn't.
- Everything you did, it all means nothing?

29:17.242 --> 29:18.672
Give me the gun.

29:30.889 --> 29:32.089
Cass.

29:32.424 --> 29:34.614
You look like you went 12 rounds
with Truckasaurus.

29:35.094 --> 29:37.374
- What happened?
- I was, um...

29:38.697 --> 29:39.627
I was betrayed.

29:40.633 --> 29:41.683
Rachel, uh...

29:42.401 --> 29:43.451
Raphael.

29:44.903 --> 29:47.923
- He corrupted her. She turned on me.
- Sorry.

29:48.507 --> 29:50.027
Girl's a real peach.

29:50.509 --> 29:52.179
She's dead.

29:55.280 --> 29:58.380
I was wounded. I needed safety.
Thank you.

29:59.585 --> 30:01.805
Hey, hey, hey.

30:03.455 --> 30:05.475
Now, what's with the finger painting?

30:05.924 --> 30:07.944
It's a warding symbol against angels.

30:08.827 --> 30:10.257
How bad does it hurt?

30:11.830 --> 30:13.670
- I'll heal.
- Well, good.

30:14.099 --> 30:17.199
We've got less than an hour before
you pick up the kids at Frontierland.

30:18.637 --> 30:20.417
I can't.

30:21.106 --> 30:22.036
Come again?

30:24.743 --> 30:26.383
This fight...

30:27.012 --> 30:27.972
drained me.

30:28.447 --> 30:29.757
Well, if you're up on blocks...

30:30.115 --> 30:32.305
call in another halo
who can get the job done.

30:33.285 --> 30:34.215
I can't.

30:34.853 --> 30:38.363
Well, there's gotta be something that
can juice you up. A spell, something.

30:39.024 --> 30:41.074
There is one thing that might work...

30:41.827 --> 30:43.557
but it's extremely dangerous.

30:43.962 --> 30:45.192
Shocker.

30:45.531 --> 30:46.821
So lay it on me.

30:47.566 --> 30:48.676
It's your soul.

30:49.368 --> 30:51.798
What do you want me to do?
Make another deal?

30:52.304 --> 30:53.354
Seal it with a kiss?

30:57.910 --> 30:59.720
I need you to let me touch it.

31:02.848 --> 31:06.538
- Touch it?
- The human soul, it's pure energy.

31:07.219 --> 31:10.469
If I can siphon some of that off, I might
be able to bring Sam and Dean back.

31:11.090 --> 31:12.140
And the catch is?

31:12.691 --> 31:16.471
Doing this is like putting your hand
in a nuclear reactor.

31:17.162 --> 31:19.382
I have to do it very gingerly.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.900
Or?

31:23.869 --> 31:25.769
Or you'll explode.

31:27.740 --> 31:28.880
Well.

31:32.177 --> 31:34.137
Keep both hands on the wheel.

31:34.580 --> 31:35.540
Let's do this.

31:44.623 --> 31:47.433
Never been late in your damn life, Sam.
Now you're dragging ass.

31:47.993 --> 31:52.093
So this is your big plan, huh?
Just let me rot in here till Finch comes.

31:52.831 --> 31:54.001
Pretty much.

31:54.566 --> 31:55.996
Why's he gunning for you, anyway?

31:56.368 --> 31:58.328
I guess you missed the part
where we hung him?

32:05.377 --> 32:08.397
No. I'm thinking to a thing like Finch,
that's no big whoop.

32:08.981 --> 32:11.791
He would've just blown town,
but he came back. That seems personal.

32:12.518 --> 32:14.598
Tell you what, you let me out of here,
we'll talk.

32:15.721 --> 32:16.681
No can do.

32:26.832 --> 32:27.852
Open up that cell.

32:28.167 --> 32:29.187
Open it yourself.

32:30.669 --> 32:31.839
You melt people's faces off.

32:32.171 --> 32:34.311
I bet you got the juice
to tear that apart easy.

32:37.142 --> 32:38.812
Unless you can't.

32:41.213 --> 32:44.403
Just like you couldn't break those cuffs
when they strung you up.

32:49.321 --> 32:50.341
Iron shackles.

32:52.324 --> 32:54.434
Iron bars, iron nail.

32:54.893 --> 32:55.883
See a pattern?

32:56.495 --> 32:59.015
Don't worry. Most creatures I meet
can't get it up for iron.

32:59.531 --> 33:00.841
It's a common monster problem.

33:01.333 --> 33:02.293
So you're a hunter.

33:03.669 --> 33:06.479
- Slash sheriff.
- You know what this son of a bitch did?

33:10.843 --> 33:13.683
- Do tell.
- I was married to a woman.

33:14.246 --> 33:15.206
Good woman, human.

33:16.648 --> 33:18.758
We lived outside of town,
didn't bother anyone.

33:19.218 --> 33:20.998
Sure. A freak with a heart of gold.

33:21.854 --> 33:23.314
You wanna call me "monster," fine.

33:23.956 --> 33:27.526
But all we did was go into town.

33:28.727 --> 33:31.307
I go into the bank for five minutes.
I come out, she's gone.

33:32.197 --> 33:33.507
And then I heard her scream.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.707
This man...

33:39.304 --> 33:41.114
had her pinned in the alley.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.760
I go to stop him, he pulls his gun...

33:44.243 --> 33:46.323
shoots me, then her.

33:48.180 --> 33:51.250
She died in my arms.

33:59.892 --> 34:01.202
Of course, I don't die.

34:03.128 --> 34:06.318
The shots brought the sheriff.
Next thing I know, I'm in iron.

34:10.768 --> 34:12.549
That's why I want him
just where he is.

34:13.205 --> 34:15.375
Trapped, scared.

34:15.841 --> 34:17.650
I saved the best for last.

34:18.210 --> 34:19.139
Is that true?

34:25.117 --> 34:26.107
So tell me.

34:26.851 --> 34:30.132
Are you really willing to die
to protect this piece of filth?

34:30.755 --> 34:32.505
Honestly, I could care less about him.

34:32.925 --> 34:34.235
- He's a dick and a coward.
- Hey.

34:34.592 --> 34:36.672
But this ain't about him.
I know what you are.

34:37.929 --> 34:39.010
Really?

34:39.331 --> 34:40.641
Yeah.

34:40.998 --> 34:43.309
So I gotta kill you.

34:44.268 --> 34:46.228
If you know what I am,
then you know you can't.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.261
Wow, I should've
seen that coming.

35:29.194 --> 35:30.261
Dean!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.965
Sam, come on, come on!

35:35.033 --> 35:36.700
Hey, where's Colt?

35:36.768 --> 35:37.901
- He's not coming.
- What?!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.037
But he sent this.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.105
Ohh.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.940
Hello, beautiful.

35:44.709 --> 35:45.743
All right.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.744
- Come on.
- Yeah.

35:48.647 --> 35:49.747
Are you sure?

35:49.814 --> 35:51.081
Well, we can't just

35:51.149 --> 35:53.651
strand those idjits
in Deadwood, can we?

35:53.718 --> 35:55.486
The risks...

35:55.553 --> 35:58.789
Just... don't explode me.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.500
Get out here, Finch!

36:11.202 --> 36:13.103
What are you doing?!

36:16.141 --> 36:18.876
Come on! Let's do this!

36:26.618 --> 36:29.386
So, this is how you want to die.

36:31.256 --> 36:33.290
Fine.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.590
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

37:48.299 --> 37:50.100
Dean!

37:51.002 --> 37:51.769
The ashes!

38:15.634 --> 38:17.401
You gotta send us back.

38:19.645 --> 38:22.447
Dean, look at him. He's fried.

38:22.515 --> 38:25.583
I never want to do that again.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.886
Bobby, you...

38:27.954 --> 38:29.921
I'm still kickin', Annie Oakley.

38:29.989 --> 38:32.490
Be back good as new in...

38:32.558 --> 38:34.859
a decade or two.

38:34.927 --> 38:36.628
And we screwed the pooch.

38:36.696 --> 38:38.830
Bobby, I'm sorry.

38:49.942 --> 38:52.310
Is there a Sam Winchester here?

38:52.378 --> 38:55.313
Who's asking?

38:55.381 --> 38:56.948
Look, this is nuts...

38:57.016 --> 38:59.484
Me and a couple guys made a bet.

38:59.552 --> 39:02.420
So... this thing's been laying
around the office since...

39:02.488 --> 39:04.956
ever!?

39:05.024 --> 39:08.393
Uh, with a note on it
saying to bring it here today.

39:08.461 --> 39:11.062
It's from a-a Samuel Colt?

39:17.136 --> 39:19.771
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
that's... that's mine.

39:19.839 --> 39:20.905
Great. Thanks.

39:20.973 --> 39:22.507
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:53.606 --> 39:56.007
"Dear Sam,
I got this address and date

39:56.075 --> 39:57.609
"off your thingamajig,

39:57.676 --> 40:01.179
"and I thought the enclosed
might come in handy.

40:01.247 --> 40:03.415
Regards, Samuel Colt."

40:13.259 --> 40:14.459
Is that what I think it is?

40:14.527 --> 40:16.594
Ashes of a Phoenix.

40:18.564 --> 40:19.898
You know what this means?

40:19.965 --> 40:22.767
Yeah, I didn't get
a "soulonoscopy" for nothing.

40:22.835 --> 40:24.302
Yes.

40:24.370 --> 40:27.972
And... it means
we take the fight to her.
