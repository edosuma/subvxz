10:42.680 --> 10:43.716
You're a dick!

10:45.560 --> 10:46.789
Dick!

10:55.440 --> 10:59.150
Tell Ian this is upside down.
It's for holding plants.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.036
He's gone hipster

11:03.160 --> 11:05.197
trying to draw in clientele.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.915
- But what is this shit?
- An ashtray.

11:08.040 --> 11:12.080
It also works if you put ash in it
upright. That's what I do.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.113
I talk to my plants but they die
because I put ash in them.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.277
I think it works. Like, rustic.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.119
Sure, sure.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.711
A kid with his mouth open
makes a good ashtray, too.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.034
I missed you!

11:28.240 --> 11:29.674
This, though...

11:29.800 --> 11:32.520
This is so ugly, man. I gotta tell you.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.632
It's really ugly. It's like, what is it?

11:34.760 --> 11:36.035
I mean, why?

11:38.800 --> 11:39.677
Great.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.874
It's like a parking spot for a pussy.
Like, put it right here.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.480
- You score with this thing?
- Of course, obviously.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.560
- With the visually impaired.
- Where do you get these women?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.194
The Association for the Blind.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.073
- They're blind?
- Of course.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.635
- Oh, perfect.
- This is braille.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.117
- What's funnier than a dead kid?
- What?

12:09.240 --> 12:10.993
A dead kid dressed like a clown.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.639
It's a good one.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.633
Hello, Roger!

13:53.320 --> 13:54.720
- This wine is really good.
- Yes.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.194
Really good.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.798
What... what is she singing in?
Because it's not Spanish.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.399
I've spent four years trying.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.477
It's the teacher's fault then.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.438
Gross.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.074
Here, here, take it.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.880
No, wait.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.513
You want to talk about it?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.591
- Swear you never spoke about it before.
- I swear.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.154
- Never?
- Never.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.273
- So why play along?
- It seemed like a good game.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.869
It's a child, not a game. It's for life.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.959
A life together,
like when we were in Barcelona.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.079
It wasn't planned, you fuckwit.
This isn't about you.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.680
Asshole.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.320
Hey! Where are you going?

31:10.480 --> 31:12.551
I just want to see the thing happen.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.433
Quit busting my ovaries!

31:14.560 --> 31:15.960
- Go now, please.
- OK.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.356
- Go to the store.
- I'm going.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.639
Should I go up the other side?

35:40.360 --> 35:43.910
- If she can do it, you can.
- But she's got it.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.714
She's so strong and sexy.
Check her out.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.676
I'll show you.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.959
You're gonna love this.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.319
- This shit's so heavy.
- Why is it heavy?

36:38.720 --> 36:41.155
- You go like this.
- Right.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.397
- You open this...
- Right.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.590
- Okay.
- There.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.875
- You smell like pussy.
- There was no soap.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.914
- Dude, I told you seven.
- Well, I'm already eating, so...

40:04.880 --> 40:07.270
- You too. Both of you.
- I like my vagina.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.993
I've got semen for both of you.

56:38.800 --> 56:39.836
So?

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.319
<i>Don't you cry for me...</i>

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.559
<i>With a banjo on my knee</i>

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.877
- Where have you been?
- Around.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.912
You could've said something.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.199
What's wrong?

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.273
I'm going back to Barcelona.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:05.949
Barcelona?

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.634
Why?

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.475
So you're leaving me with this mess?

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.034
This mess or this kid?

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.114
The mess or the kid?

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.717
Or are you gonna name him mess?

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:23.752
You're going to be a mother.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.229
Do you even care?

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.638
You're going to be a mother.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.116
Are you understanding this or not?

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.552
You don't deserve to be a mother,
you know that?

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.752
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Fucking look at me.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.031
- Fucking look at me and leave this.
- Dude!

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.799
Leave the fucking wood.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.560
What are you doing?
I've been working all day!

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.909
- Go grab it!
- What are you doing?

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.520
Go grab it right now.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.115
<i>I have a pair of black eyes</i>

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.790
<i>Who will take them from my hands?</i>

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.470
<i>On sale for being deceitful</i>

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.116
<i>Because they treated me bad</i>

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.950
<i>Those black eyes, so two-faced</i>

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.754
<i>Oh, how you look at me</i>

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.151
<i>Such joy they show for others</i>

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.715
<i>But for me just misery</i>

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.432
<i>The longer my longing</i>

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.199
<i>My love for you only grows</i>

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.912
<i>And I spend my nights awake</i>

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.033
<i>Sighing for your love</i>

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.238
<i>The longer my longing</i>

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.675
<i>My love for you only grows</i>

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.239
<i>And I spend my nights...</i>

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.589
What's wrong?

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.400
I miss Chorizo.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.118
Don't laugh, man.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.237
You miss Chorizo?

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.192
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.357
When we first bought the piano...

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.675
He'd play with me, man.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.316
He'd jump up
and he'd go out the window.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:58.439
Don't cry. He was a cat pianist?
I thought he was retarded.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.837
- That's why I loved him, man.
- "Because he was like me, man."

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:02.996
Chorizo.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.391
He played so well.
He'd jump up by me.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.880
<i>I once had me a kitty</i>

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.556
<i>Who didn't know how to float</i>

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.798
<i>But since he was retarded</i>

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.072
<i>Into the canal he would go...</i>

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.872
<i>Ay, my Chorizo</i>

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.955
<i>Chorizo the half-wit</i>

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.192
<i>Every night he went behind</i>

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.880
<i>The couch to take a piss</i>

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.677
<i>Ay, my Chorizo...</i>

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.077
Okay, enough. Enough, enough.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.758
Enough, enough, enough.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:00.556
We're going out.

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.070
- No, I don't want to...
- Yes, listen to me...

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.078
Listen. We're going salsa dancing.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.114
- No, not salsa, man!
- Oh, right. Not salsa.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.960
- Don't laugh.
- No salsa, sorry.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.199
I forgot how much Chorizo liked salsa.
Sorry, I spaced out.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.789
- He liked all music.
- All of it, all music.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.119
Hey, let's go out and hook up.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.232
You haven't left the boat in ages.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.194
- You mean, "Let's get laid."
- Right, exactly. Fuck.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.310
You know I'll score all the chicks.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.195
Take it down a notch.
You're rusty. Let's go?

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.514
Go get masculine and let's go.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.632
I won over the dark-haired girl.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.236
Quit busting my balls.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.352
Me, the dark-haired girl
and you, the nice one.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.431
No, sorry.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.151
For you.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.117
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.520
Land dry?

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.239
It's "firm land." Firm land...

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.874
Firm land.
