WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.415
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.416 --> 00:05.219
Shoplifting is a class a misdemeanor.

00:05.220 --> 00:06.178
We need to get ahead of this thing,

00:06.179 --> 00:07.894
or else the fallout could be huge.

00:07.895 --> 00:10.011
Your tour for now... it's off.

00:10.012 --> 00:11.905
We have kept this secret a long time.

00:11.906 --> 00:14.477
She was willing to defraud a
credit union with you. Why?

00:15.021 --> 00:17.235
She wanted our relationship
to be more than I did...

00:17.236 --> 00:18.513
But that was on her end.

00:18.514 --> 00:20.523
We just cut the first
track of my next record.

00:20.524 --> 00:21.830
I loved it.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.646
There's seven in there. I know.
I counted 'em all night.

00:24.744 --> 00:27.907
Where's Rayna? I like it
better when she sings.

00:27.908 --> 00:30.889
Looks like I'm not the only one
who can get myself into trouble.

00:35.906 --> 00:37.251
It's our job at the zoo.

00:37.252 --> 00:40.390
To teach people about animals and
how we can protect them.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.076
I do not see how this is supposed
to help my public image.

00:43.077 --> 00:44.063
There are studies that show.

00:44.064 --> 00:46.131
That people literally
care more about animals.

00:46.132 --> 00:49.803
Than they do about starlets on
reality TV shows or the poor.

00:49.804 --> 00:51.812
Well, this better be the
last dumb P.R. thing

00:51.813 --> 00:52.439
I have to do.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.690
You haven't let me do
anything fun in three weeks.

00:54.691 --> 00:55.892
And whose fault is that?

00:55.893 --> 00:58.183
If any of these adorable baby
animals take a crap on me,

00:58.184 --> 01:00.203
I'm gonna be very upset.

01:00.204 --> 01:01.983
We're looking forward to a great day.

01:01.984 --> 01:05.566
Right now please join me in
welcoming our special guest,

01:05.567 --> 01:06.987
Sean Butler.

01:08.639 --> 01:09.642
Thank you.

01:12.464 --> 01:15.503
You know, my grandmother took
me to the zoo every Saturday...

01:15.504 --> 01:17.104
Xxx.

01:15.892 --> 01:19.534
Well, every Saturday until
pop Warner football started.

01:20.261 --> 01:22.575
Listen, I want you guys
all to have a great time,

01:22.608 --> 01:24.490
and thank you so much for coming.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.750
What'd the goody two-shoes pro
quarterback do to get here?

01:27.996 --> 01:28.939
What'd he get in trouble for?

01:28.940 --> 01:31.227
He isn't in trouble.
This is his fund-raiser.

01:31.228 --> 01:32.870
Smile and be nice to him.

01:33.628 --> 01:35.692
Hi. Hi. Sean Butler.

01:35.693 --> 01:37.081
Juliette. Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming by.

01:37.082 --> 01:38.462
And supporting the event this year.

01:38.463 --> 01:39.883
Oh, my pleasure.

01:40.111 --> 01:41.754
Would you like to hold him? Mm-hmm.

01:44.284 --> 01:45.942
Hold it right there.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:03.480 --> 02:05.520
All right, lay it on me, Marshall.
What do you think?

02:05.521 --> 02:07.043
It's different, but there's potential.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.859
Come on, Marshall. You know...
You know that's a great song.

02:09.860 --> 02:12.176
We're in business together. We
got one more album to make,

02:12.177 --> 02:13.775
and I'm gonna write it.

02:13.776 --> 02:15.194
And I think we'll go from there.

02:15.195 --> 02:16.853
Well, who's producing it... Randy?

02:17.115 --> 02:19.531
I don't think so. You know,
I love Randy so much,

02:19.532 --> 02:21.627
but I kind of feel like
been there, done that.

02:21.628 --> 02:24.246
I need some different energy on this.

02:25.252 --> 02:26.318
Okay.

02:27.284 --> 02:29.005
Bucky knows our approved producers.

02:29.006 --> 02:30.861
Just choose someone you wanna work with.

02:30.862 --> 02:32.917
Okay. Sounds fair.

02:33.599 --> 02:35.033
Nice to see you, Marshall.

02:40.313 --> 02:43.514
Boy, you just gotta let 'em
think it's their idea.

02:43.515 --> 02:44.645
Yeah.

02:45.484 --> 02:47.227
Election's just over a month away,

02:47.228 --> 02:49.482
and you're still 7 points
back in the polls.

02:49.483 --> 02:51.957
You've done very well, but
you need to do better.

02:52.924 --> 02:53.790
What are you thinking?

02:53.791 --> 02:56.137
The clean campaign pledge event tomorrow...

02:56.175 --> 02:57.682
You, Coleman.

02:57.683 --> 02:59.071
The press will be there.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.155
You guys make a big show
of signing the pledge.

03:01.156 --> 03:02.200
At you won't go dirty.

03:02.201 --> 03:03.789
That event's been on the books for weeks.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.892
But what if a supporter in law enforcement.

03:05.893 --> 03:09.035
Could delay Coleman on his
way to the pledge signing?

03:09.036 --> 03:11.983
Which will give you time
to say to the media that.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.010
He's just not taking the pledge seriously.

03:15.011 --> 03:16.225
It's a small thing.

03:16.226 --> 03:18.726
It's harmless, but it is effective.

03:18.727 --> 03:20.962
I told you, when I agreed to run,

03:21.300 --> 03:23.903
that I don't wanna do anything
to harm Coleman personally.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.131
We also talked about

03:25.132 --> 03:27.386
how you wanna be the
next mayor of Nashville.

03:27.387 --> 03:29.417
You said you'd do whatever it took.

03:31.037 --> 03:33.606
Campaigns are about creating opportunities.

03:35.564 --> 03:36.965
A traffic stop.

03:37.948 --> 03:38.808
That's it?

03:38.809 --> 03:39.845
That's it.

03:47.975 --> 03:49.697
Is this the thing you were looking for?

03:49.944 --> 03:51.313
Oh, yeah, perfect.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.659
It was hiding under the couch.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.998
You're a lifesaver.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.061
Hey, listen, Scarlett,

03:58.275 --> 04:01.245
I know I haven't been in
the best of moods lately,

04:01.679 --> 04:03.603
and I'm sorry. You know,
work's been crappy,

04:04.280 --> 04:06.075
and I will pay you back
my half of the rent.

04:06.076 --> 04:08.102
I didn't mind covering it.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.003
What I'm trying to say is thank you.

04:10.004 --> 04:12.126
And what I'm trying to
say is you're welcome.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.231
He's comin'.

04:17.413 --> 04:18.410
Who's comin'?

04:18.720 --> 04:20.211
Reid Olson. Are you serious?

04:20.212 --> 04:21.058
Yeah, man.

04:21.059 --> 04:22.079
Yes!

04:22.467 --> 04:23.779
Who's Reid Olson?

04:23.780 --> 04:25.054
Oh. He's a...

04:25.429 --> 04:28.686
Regional promoter, helps
book local opening acts.

04:28.756 --> 04:30.755
For big tours that are coming through town.

04:30.756 --> 04:32.691
J.T.'s cousin's friend knows him.

04:32.692 --> 04:33.445
He's hooking us up.

04:33.446 --> 04:35.792
Oh, baby, that is huge.

04:37.334 --> 04:38.932
Things are gonna turn around
for me tonight, Scarlett.

04:38.933 --> 04:40.573
I can feel it. Mm-hmm.

04:43.365 --> 04:45.472
What do you think about Liam McGuinnis?

04:45.620 --> 04:46.700
What do I think about him?

04:46.701 --> 04:49.540
I think he's a nonstarter
and he's a crazy rock star.

04:49.541 --> 04:52.852
Well, he also just recently relocated.

04:52.853 --> 04:55.248
To good ol' music city U.S.A.

04:55.412 --> 04:57.060
Rayna, come on. You gotta be kidding me.

04:57.061 --> 05:00.203
This guy would not know Kenny
Chesney from Kenny Rogers.

05:00.204 --> 05:01.402
He's won five grammys.

05:01.403 --> 05:03.626
Well, he's won zero
C.M.As he's... he's rock.

05:03.627 --> 05:04.336
He's not country.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.428
Well, he's also one.

05:05.429 --> 05:09.004
Of the top ten downloaded
artists on iTunes,

05:09.005 --> 05:11.079
and all his albums have
gone triple platinum,

05:11.080 --> 05:14.110
and he has a dog named "June"
after June Carter cash.

05:14.111 --> 05:15.784
Oh, my God. How many times
have you read that article?

05:15.785 --> 05:16.867
A lot of times.

05:17.737 --> 05:19.188
Get me a meeting, please.

05:26.938 --> 05:29.026
The photo has been retweeted
a quarter of a million times.

05:29.027 --> 05:30.125
Since this morning.

05:30.126 --> 05:32.375
You're trending with all
the pro football hashtags,

05:32.376 --> 05:36.479
and we've got 20,000 new follower requests.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.298
That's a great photo.

05:40.672 --> 05:43.816
I have a large rodent on my head.

05:43.817 --> 05:46.171
That by definition is not a great photo.

05:46.172 --> 05:48.278
This is exactly what we needed.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.187
Sean Butler is the best thing
to happen to you in ages.

05:51.188 --> 05:53.756
Why? He's boring, and he sucks at football.

05:53.757 --> 05:55.796
He's a rookie. So?

05:55.797 --> 05:56.894
Doesn't help the boring.

05:56.895 --> 05:58.543
I want you to go out with him.

05:58.544 --> 05:59.376
Pass.

05:59.377 --> 06:01.532
Just go to dinner with him. I'll set it up.

06:02.256 --> 06:03.230
Coffee.

06:03.231 --> 06:04.170
Dinner.

06:05.776 --> 06:08.291
Seems like a small sacrifice
to save your career.

06:08.292 --> 06:10.591
You're seriously telling
me that going on a date.

06:10.592 --> 06:12.699
With a boring,
stick-in-the-mud quarterback.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.138
Is somehow gonna help relaunch my tour?

06:15.139 --> 06:16.128
It'll do a hell of a lot more.

06:16.129 --> 06:18.363
Than boosting that bottle of nail polish did.

06:22.179 --> 06:23.181
Fine.

Okay? Come here.

08:38.787 --> 08:39.807
Excuse me.

08:39.876 --> 08:41.298
Uh, Reid Olson, right?

08:41.299 --> 08:42.227
Right.

08:42.229 --> 08:43.355
Avery barkley.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.644
Nice job up there.

08:44.684 --> 08:46.677
Your friends were not lying about you guys.

08:46.713 --> 08:48.379
Well, he said you were
looking for someone to be.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.711
The first local opener for the Lumineers.

08:50.712 --> 08:52.838
When they come into town in a few weeks.

08:52.839 --> 08:54.114
Think you guys are ready for that?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.426
No question.

08:57.523 --> 08:58.583
Okay.

08:58.584 --> 09:00.807
Well, it's good to meet you.
Great to hear you play.

09:01.096 --> 09:02.114
All right.

09:03.048 --> 09:04.466
Did he like you or not?

09:05.016 --> 09:06.065
I don't know. Mm.

09:07.704 --> 09:09.714
He did, but Reid's a coward.

09:10.025 --> 09:11.173
He never knows if he likes anything.

09:11.174 --> 09:13.648
Until at least ten people
in town tell him he does.

09:14.886 --> 09:16.192
Marilyn rhodes.

09:16.791 --> 09:17.905
Avery.

09:17.975 --> 09:18.886
Barkley, I know.

09:18.887 --> 09:19.819
Yeah.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.567
This is my girlfriend Scarlett O'Conner.

09:21.568 --> 09:22.683
Nice to meet you.

09:24.808 --> 09:26.151
Okay, well, I'm a manager,

09:26.152 --> 09:28.450
and I would love to represent
you and your band.

09:28.536 --> 09:29.719
I think you're gonna be huge,

09:29.720 --> 09:31.681
and I wanna help you get where you belong.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.326
Well, that's really kind
of you to say, Ms. rhodes.

09:36.327 --> 09:38.242
Can I, uh, buy you a drink?

09:41.188 --> 09:44.398
No. But why don't you give
me a call so we can talk?

09:46.215 --> 09:48.017
Reid and I go back a long way,

09:48.416 --> 09:50.970
and I think you'd be a great
opener for the Lumineers.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.179
Good night.

09:55.764 --> 09:57.003
Oh, my God.

09:57.004 --> 09:58.790
Oh, my God.

09:59.084 --> 10:00.710
Is this really his studio?

10:00.828 --> 10:03.190
I'm surprised we didn't get
carjacked driving over here.

10:03.261 --> 10:04.757
You sound disappointed.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.742
Oh, good lord. Be careful.

10:13.204 --> 10:14.462
We had an appointment, right?

10:14.503 --> 10:15.442
Yeah.

10:23.032 --> 10:23.956
Hey!

10:24.617 --> 10:25.794
I'm Rayna James.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.594
Yeah, I know who you are.

10:30.075 --> 10:31.960
Well, great. I, uh... this is Bucky.

10:31.961 --> 10:34.042
I think y'all just spoke
a little while ago,

10:34.043 --> 10:35.656
and, uh, we're excited to talk to you.

10:35.657 --> 10:37.656
About possibly producing my new album.

10:37.657 --> 10:38.804
I'm doing all the writing on it.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.021
Can't wait for you to hear
some of the new stuff.

10:41.651 --> 10:43.981
I really don't think I need
to hear the new stuff.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.763
I took this consultation as a courtesy,

10:45.764 --> 10:48.974
but I don't think we do the
same thing with our music.

10:49.508 --> 10:52.704
You're... moms and S.U.Vs.

10:52.705 --> 10:54.651
That's a language I just don't speak.

10:55.041 --> 10:56.138
Excuse me?

10:56.433 --> 10:57.851
There won't be a charge.

11:06.909 --> 11:10.054
Moms and S.U.Vs?

11:10.678 --> 11:16.078
<font color="#40bfff">Sync by YYeTS</font>
<font color="#40bfff">Corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

11:24.380 --> 11:27.097
I saw your latest video for
the song with the telescope.

11:27.326 --> 11:28.457
It was really good.

11:28.927 --> 11:31.006
You know that this is a setup, right?

11:31.007 --> 11:34.296
It just our publicists playing
at being good at their jobs.

11:34.415 --> 11:36.029
It's not an actual date.

11:36.030 --> 11:38.856
Yeah. I just figured we could
enjoy anyway, you know?

11:38.879 --> 11:40.297
Get to know each other a little?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.209
Well, here's something I
wouldn't mind knowin'.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.939
You were an all-American
football player in college,

11:45.940 --> 11:49.303
number one draft pick, and now
you seem completely incapable.

11:49.304 --> 11:50.775
Of completing a pass.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.705
I mean, six turnovers in one game?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.107
What?

11:55.559 --> 11:57.003
You said you wanted to
get to know each other.

12:12.769 --> 12:14.555
That's a sight I never thought I'd see.

12:15.266 --> 12:17.612
Scarlett sent it over. She worries.

12:18.226 --> 12:20.901
Spent a few hours in jail,
not a month in my deathbed.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.350
I'm fine, all right? I
wasn't drinking, either.

12:28.380 --> 12:31.269
Hey, do you know a-a Marilyn rhodes?

12:32.220 --> 12:33.799
Marilyn coming after y'all?

12:34.204 --> 12:36.343
She's tight with this booker,

12:38.901 --> 12:41.664
Reid handling that? Yeah.
You know him, too?

12:42.326 --> 12:43.376
Yeah. Small town.

12:45.269 --> 12:47.491
Look, uh, I'll give him a
call for you, all right?

12:47.492 --> 12:48.668
I'll put in a good word.

12:48.669 --> 12:51.001
You'd do that? Yeah,
look, I don't want you.

12:51.002 --> 12:53.652
Wasting your time or your money
on a manager, all right?

12:54.042 --> 12:57.060
I... really appreciate that.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.795
You know, for some reason,
I always thought that.

13:03.796 --> 13:05.630
You didn't really like me very much.

13:06.143 --> 13:08.059
Well, I don't know why you'd think that.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.498
Hey. Me again.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.499
It's always good to see you, Ms. Jaymes,

13:31.500 --> 13:33.216
but I'm not sure what more
we've got to talk about.

13:33.217 --> 13:34.811
Oh. Well, see, that's the thing.

13:34.812 --> 13:36.535
That kinda glitches me a little bit,

13:36.536 --> 13:39.527
'cause I feel like we never even
got a chance to talk yesterday,

13:39.528 --> 13:42.403
'cause you kinda shut the door in my face.

13:42.728 --> 13:43.762
So talk.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.555
Okay.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.419
Um, well, I feel like you kinda made.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.774
A snap judgment about me and my music.

13:50.775 --> 13:53.502
Uh, quite frankly and
respectfully, of course,

13:53.503 --> 13:54.414
that was a load of crap.

13:54.415 --> 13:55.989
You know, I think you might
have heard a couple of my hits,

13:55.990 --> 13:58.436
maybe "already gone,"
maybe "american beauty."

13:58.437 --> 13:59.966
You think you know who I am.

14:00.148 --> 14:03.150
That is sort of like if I had judged you.

14:03.168 --> 14:05.103
Without ever hearing that live show.

14:05.104 --> 14:07.966
That you did two years ago
in belfast, for example.

14:07.967 --> 14:09.735
You heard that? I did hear that.

14:09.736 --> 14:13.858
In fact, I heard it right
there in that S.U.V.,

14:14.184 --> 14:16.115
which, by the way, has an
excellent sound system,

14:16.116 --> 14:18.526
driving my daughters to school.

14:18.997 --> 14:20.333
They liked it, too.

14:23.603 --> 14:27.023
So do me a favor. Listen to that.

14:28.213 --> 14:30.606
Okay? Then make a decision.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.560
Appreciate that.

14:33.412 --> 14:34.462
Come on in.

14:35.155 --> 14:36.560
Let's just talk for real.

14:37.875 --> 14:38.942
All right.

15:00.492 --> 15:02.519
Oh, officer. Is there a problem?

15:02.520 --> 15:04.722
You failed to signal a turn back there.

15:05.390 --> 15:07.006
License and registration.

15:07.007 --> 15:10.032
I'm, uh, Coleman Carlisle.

15:10.033 --> 15:13.259
Yeah, I've seen your ads. License, please.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.715
Look, I really appreciate all
your hard work, but, um,

15:15.716 --> 15:17.189
I have a really important engagement.

15:17.190 --> 15:19.049
Happening downtown in just a few minutes,

15:19.050 --> 15:21.283
so I promise I'll be very careful,

15:21.295 --> 15:24.301
and we can treat this as a
warning, and I'll just go.

15:24.302 --> 15:25.530
Thanks very much.

15:25.536 --> 15:27.002
Are you getting belligerent with me?

15:28.623 --> 15:29.769
Are you serious?

15:29.776 --> 15:31.801
I think you'd better step
on out of the vehicle.

15:32.016 --> 15:33.545
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

15:44.696 --> 15:47.394
It's hard to imagine what
could be more important.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.664
Oh, who knows? Maybe the
councilman's the lucky guy.

15:49.665 --> 15:51.595
Who won the mega millions last night.

15:55.023 --> 15:56.896
In all seriousness, I hope
the councilman's okay,

15:56.897 --> 15:58.668
but this is too important to wait.

15:58.669 --> 16:00.196
I'm signing this clean campaign pledge.

16:00.197 --> 16:02.018
Because we need to stick to what matters,

16:02.019 --> 16:03.453
and that is the issues.

16:03.572 --> 16:05.171
And I am firmly committed to being.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.217
The man that you can trust
during this election.

16:07.218 --> 16:10.395
To conduct his campaign
with honesty and integrity.

16:23.532 --> 16:25.644
Are you as much of a goody
two-shoes as you seem?

16:25.645 --> 16:27.799
You really as much of a klepto as you seem?

16:31.806 --> 16:34.488
Okay. So you're not a total pushover.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.248
It's not that easy being a rookie.

16:36.846 --> 16:38.952
I just choose to work hard at it.

16:39.006 --> 16:40.097
But you never go out?

16:40.098 --> 16:42.893
I'd like to keep my position
as starting quarterback.

16:43.122 --> 16:45.451
I got an idea. Let's get outta here.

16:45.452 --> 16:47.205
And go where? Wherever we want.

16:47.276 --> 16:49.091
We're young, we're hot, and I got a jet.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.883
And I got practice in the morning.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.366
Aw. And I promise I'll have
you back by your curfew.

16:56.653 --> 16:58.073
Let's go, choirboy.

17:00.691 --> 17:01.900
Good to see you. Thanks for being here.

17:01.901 --> 17:03.728
Appreciate the support. Take care.

17:03.729 --> 17:06.363
Nice job, Mr. soon-to-be mayor,

17:06.364 --> 17:07.794
so, uh, what are you doing here?

17:07.795 --> 17:09.630
I'm volunteering for your campaign.

17:09.926 --> 17:11.586
Wow, that's, uh... that's unexpected.

17:11.587 --> 17:13.436
Well, I have a light workload right now,

17:13.438 --> 17:15.638
and Robert's in Hong Kong
starting a new business. Oh.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.674
So I thought...

17:16.760 --> 17:18.450
Why not come work for you?

17:18.728 --> 17:19.730
Why not?

17:20.263 --> 17:21.755
Well... take care.

17:21.756 --> 17:23.348
Okay. You, too, Peggy.

17:25.452 --> 17:26.493
Hey there. All right. Great job.

17:26.494 --> 17:27.502
Thanks for being here.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.875
Look, this is straight up harassment.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.535
It's a traffic violation,
but if your belligerence...

17:31.536 --> 17:34.138
Officer Dunigan, I got something.

17:39.312 --> 17:42.330
Sir, do you have a prescription
for this oxycontin?

17:44.273 --> 17:46.890
Look, I can explain. It's not a problem.

17:47.292 --> 17:48.455
I'm placing you under arrest.

17:48.456 --> 17:51.266
Pending a preliminary
narcotics investigation.

17:51.509 --> 17:53.272
Based on the contents of your vehicle, sir.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.306
Turn around.

18:05.863 --> 18:07.346
Now you gonna tell me where we're going?

18:08.185 --> 18:09.282
South beach.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.083
Oh, I was in Miami last week.

18:12.136 --> 18:15.053
Yeah. Any good excuse for
not calling audibles?

18:15.054 --> 18:16.025
Okay.

18:16.270 --> 18:18.367
I give up. Oh, it'll be fun.

18:18.368 --> 18:20.783
A friend of mine can get
us into the balcony.

18:20.784 --> 18:22.010
Which balcony?

18:22.336 --> 18:23.642
The balcony.

18:25.392 --> 18:27.663
You do not get out much, do you?

18:27.664 --> 18:29.978
Have you ever been drunk? I don't drink.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.945
Like during the season?

18:32.240 --> 18:34.953
Not ever. Never saw the need.

18:35.685 --> 18:37.962
You really are a choirboy.

18:41.489 --> 18:42.715
Or not.

18:51.121 --> 18:52.169
You play?

18:53.151 --> 18:55.059
This is what you learn
to do when you stay in.

18:55.060 --> 18:56.942
A lot of Friday and Saturday nights.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.598
You know my music?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.562
I have a sister. Come on.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.908
♪I might stay up, drunk on wine♪

19:10.909 --> 19:12.995
♪Hurtin' like hell, ugly cryin'♪

19:12.996 --> 19:16.431
♪Black mascara tears♪

19:16.563 --> 19:19.206

♪Miss you bad for a month or so♪

19:21.104 --> 19:25.146
♪But let me tell you somethin', my dear♪

19:25.521 --> 19:27.315

♪But you're never gonna find

19:32.684 --> 19:35.238
♪Oh, no, no♪

19:38.171 --> 19:39.223
Careful there.

19:39.468 --> 19:40.438
What?

19:41.388 --> 19:43.606
You might just be havin'
a good time with me.

19:49.628 --> 19:51.207
I love your sound.

19:52.252 --> 19:54.710
I wanna... I'm looking for
a sound that's gonna...

19:56.540 --> 19:58.644
Snap people's heads around and...

20:00.709 --> 20:02.326
Grab 'em by their ears and...

20:03.290 --> 20:04.929
Hold them down till I let 'em go.

20:04.930 --> 20:08.049
But you can't... just
take your... your mandolins.

20:08.050 --> 20:10.659
And banjos and pedal steel and throw it.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.602
Through a bunch of distortion
and call it "rock."

20:12.816 --> 20:14.749
Nope, that's not what I'm asking for.

20:15.502 --> 20:17.899
You... think I'm gonna put
my career on the line,

20:18.560 --> 20:19.725
go up against my label.

20:19.726 --> 20:21.853
Just so I can do somethin' half-ass. Nope.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.211
Listen, you put out a bunch of hits,

20:26.399 --> 20:27.948
that fame starts comin'.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.929
My experience is, I've just
gotten further and further away.

20:30.930 --> 20:35.155
From why I decided to do
this in the first place,

20:35.156 --> 20:37.586
which was about sharing
my truth with people.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.727
So you came to me to find your voice again?

20:40.256 --> 20:41.760
To find my voice now, yeah.

20:45.857 --> 20:47.822
Sometimes you gotta blow up the box.

20:49.075 --> 20:50.048
Let's have a drink.

20:52.724 --> 20:55.121
You know, I cannot have a drink.

20:56.035 --> 20:58.108
Why not? 'Cause I gotta go home.
It's getting late.

20:58.109 --> 20:59.532
I got two kids at home.

20:59.533 --> 21:01.031
I got a husband.

21:01.032 --> 21:03.525
Wait. You don't think you can
make music on a schedule, right?

21:03.526 --> 21:06.204
You can if you're me. All
that stuff going on...

21:06.205 --> 21:08.739
I have a constant buzz
in my head all the time.

21:08.740 --> 21:10.550
This person's gotta be here at this point.

21:10.551 --> 21:12.051
This person's gotta be there at this point.

21:12.601 --> 21:13.958
All the time. That's my life.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.700
Your kids are home, right?

21:15.701 --> 21:17.647
They're safe and sound
and well taken care of?

21:17.648 --> 21:18.539
They better be.

21:18.642 --> 21:20.554
Well, let's drown out the
buzz for a little while.

21:25.278 --> 21:26.331
Blow up the box.

21:31.798 --> 21:32.674
Marilyn.

21:32.735 --> 21:33.659
Buy you a drink?

21:36.465 --> 21:37.981
Deacon Claybourne.

21:38.816 --> 21:39.853
Been a long time.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.843
Yeah, look, I heard you've been
trying to sign Avery barkley.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.239
You don't need to do that.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.630
I already talked to Reid for him.

21:47.492 --> 21:49.774
You suddenly taking an
interest in who I work with?

21:49.809 --> 21:52.223
Just this one. He's my niece's boyfriend.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.217
I don't want her to be hurt by anything.

21:54.218 --> 21:56.117
That... might happen.

21:56.746 --> 21:58.100
So why are you talking to me?

21:58.849 --> 22:01.200
He's an ambitious kid.
Sometimes a drownin' man...

22:01.201 --> 22:03.745
Well, he'll grab onto almost anything.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.469
You should've signed with me
when we were starting out.

22:07.538 --> 22:09.488
Oh, yeah? You had so much promise.

22:11.428 --> 22:12.214
I would have made you more.

22:12.215 --> 22:14.417
Than just the guy standing
behind Rayna James.

22:15.736 --> 22:16.580
You might've.

22:16.732 --> 22:17.703
I would've.

22:19.691 --> 22:20.614
Yeah, well...

22:21.918 --> 22:23.847
It wasn't worth the price of finding out.

22:24.828 --> 22:26.295
I guess now we'll never know.

22:26.748 --> 22:27.619
Good to see you, Marilyn.

22:28.039 --> 22:29.765
Always a pleasure, Deacon.

22:33.396 --> 22:36.439
What the hell happened?
Narcotic possession?

22:36.440 --> 22:39.029
You said that it was gonna
be a traffic stop, lamar.

22:39.030 --> 22:40.433
That's all it was.

22:40.884 --> 22:43.971
Who knew those officers
were gonna find drugs.

22:43.972 --> 22:45.826
On a man running for public office?

22:45.827 --> 22:46.740
It's pure luck.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.147
Yeah, yeah, you sure you're as.

22:48.148 --> 22:49.774
Surprised as you're pretending to be?

22:49.775 --> 22:51.407
I had nothing to do with the drugs,

22:51.408 --> 22:53.532
and I'm offended by the accusation.

22:57.087 --> 22:59.290
Anything else you think
you're entitled to know?

23:06.604 --> 23:07.754
I talked to my cousin.

23:09.675 --> 23:10.729
What, we didn't get it?

23:11.586 --> 23:15.199
Nope. Oh, damn it! So much for Deon's help.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.158
Who got the job?

23:17.249 --> 23:18.271
Lindi Ortega?

23:18.790 --> 23:21.650
Man, is there a gig in town
they haven't gotten lately?

23:37.926 --> 23:39.699
This really is a wild scene.

23:40.084 --> 23:41.554
I told you it would be.

Club soda, please?

23:45.083 --> 23:46.150
Choirboy.

23:46.348 --> 23:47.604
I've got practice.

23:51.232 --> 23:53.067
I was never actually a choirboy, you know.

23:58.239 --> 23:59.260

27:40.335 --> 27:41.479
Oh, well after 2:00.

27:41.486 --> 27:44.684
Oh, God. I think it was
that second whiskey shot.

27:44.685 --> 27:46.445
That made the third and
the fourth one seem.

27:46.446 --> 27:47.528

took the girls to school.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.885

28:01.886 --> 28:03.689
Oh, shoot!

28:08.160 --> 28:10.739

cupcakes for the girls.

28:10.740 --> 28:11.919
I promised I would make 'em.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.196
Now I'm gonna have to pick 'em up...

28:15.104 --> 28:16.405

28:16.406 --> 28:19.377
Oh. Oh, lord. You might
have to take me to my car.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.034

28:29.096 --> 28:29.990
What?

28:31.038 --> 28:32.717
Sources close to the investigation.

28:32.718 --> 28:34.208
Report that narcotics were found.

28:34.209 --> 28:35.743
In the councilman's possession.

28:35.744 --> 28:38.138
I, uh, quit drinking 19 years ago.

28:38.912 --> 28:40.010
My sobriety.

28:40.367 --> 28:42.682
Saved me from losing the love of my life...

28:44.590 --> 28:45.722
And I'm proud of it.

28:46.473 --> 28:48.212
Part of my recovery.

28:49.494 --> 28:50.823
Is to sponsor addicts.

28:51.208 --> 28:53.621
The drugs that were found in
my car were surrendered to me.

28:53.622 --> 28:56.693
By a good man who asked me
to save him from himself.

28:57.099 --> 28:59.626
I am releasing the results
of my blood test.

28:59.627 --> 29:01.960
To further prove that I am drug-free.

29:01.961 --> 29:03.813

will settle this matter.

to the real issues.

Thank you very much. No questions.

29:11.277 --> 29:12.252
Reporting live...

29:12.254 --> 29:13.562
That's impossible.

29:17.519 --> 29:19.710
Coleman was pulled over
for a traffic violation,

29:19.711 --> 29:21.609
and they found oxycontin in his car.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.756
He has been sober for 20 years.

29:23.757 --> 29:25.162
Yeah, I know, but, um...

29:25.791 --> 29:27.470
People fall off the wagon sometimes.

29:27.471 --> 29:28.428
Not Coleman.

29:28.944 --> 29:30.923
Where did that happen? I think belle Meade.

29:32.593 --> 29:33.517
Teddy...

29:34.224 --> 29:35.519
What is daddy doing now?

29:35.520 --> 29:37.117

29:48.544 --> 29:50.903
Aw, you're just lettin'
yourself into my house now?

29:51.131 --> 29:53.959
I saw the tweets about just how
good a time you were having.

29:55.051 --> 29:56.344
Then I was shown this.

29:59.659 --> 30:01.595
You were the one who told
me to go out with him.

30:01.596 --> 30:03.030
You are not gonna put this on me.

30:03.244 --> 30:05.642
This guy's threatening to go out
to everyone with this shot.

30:05.643 --> 30:07.653
So much for Sean's squeaky-clean image.

30:08.267 --> 30:09.948
This is assault and public drunkenness.

30:09.949 --> 30:11.529
He wasn't even drinking. Who cares?

30:11.530 --> 30:12.550
He looks wasted.

30:13.339 --> 30:15.223
The tweets are bad enough, but...

30:15.690 --> 30:18.404

that'll kill a career.

30:28.616 --> 30:29.971

30:30.362 --> 30:32.313

go check out that bar.

30:32.314 --> 30:34.351

you and Avery wanna join.

30:34.352 --> 30:35.200

30:35.201 --> 30:37.167

that manager lady tonight.

30:37.745 --> 30:39.875
Oh. What?

30:40.024 --> 30:41.108
Uh, nothin'.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.662
It's just, you sure she's good for him?

30:44.957 --> 30:47.160
Why? Do you know her?

30:47.361 --> 30:48.426
No, just...

30:49.133 --> 30:51.516
Deacon didn't seem too hot
on the idea the other night.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.749

30:52.750 --> 30:53.855

would do that. Mnh-mnh.

34:45.277 --> 34:46.893
At least let me set the record straight.

34:46.893 --> 34:47.967
I'll call "the tennessean."

34:47.967 --> 34:49.301
I'll tell 'em that you're my sponsor.

34:49.302 --> 34:50.228
No, let it go. Come on.

34:50.228 --> 34:51.746
I don't want your name in the mix.

34:51.761 --> 34:54.143
You know this program doesn't
work unless it's anonymous.

34:57.986 --> 34:59.230
Look, I should've thrown 'em out.

35:00.644 --> 35:01.904
God knows I should've.

35:03.413 --> 35:05.938
But this is not your fault, Deacon.
Not by a long shot.

35:14.947 --> 35:15.856
Go get 'em, man.

35:35.701 --> 35:36.545
Hey, babe.

35:37.910 --> 35:39.167
Did you sleep with that woman?

35:42.837 --> 35:43.648
What?

35:45.718 --> 35:46.611
No.

35:46.638 --> 35:48.412
Did you know that's what
she wanted from you?

35:48.532 --> 35:49.597
Who told you that?

35:50.140 --> 35:50.985
I mean, if I'd he known,

35:50.986 --> 35:53.287
I would've never gone over
there in the first place.

35:53.288 --> 35:55.480
I can't believe you would even think that

35:55.481 --> 35:58.775
I would consider putting myself
in that kind of a situation.

36:00.904 --> 36:01.993
You know, when you're telling the truth,

36:01.994 --> 36:03.460
I get two words out of you.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.997
When you're lying, you can't shut up.

36:07.067 --> 36:09.380
Hey. Scarlett! I didn't do anything.

36:09.496 --> 36:11.714
You thought all about it! But I didn't!

36:12.280 --> 36:13.571
That's what matters, right?

36:13.797 --> 36:15.698
Oh, right, so I'm supposed to be okay.

36:15.699 --> 36:16.884
With the fact that you went over there,

36:16.885 --> 36:18.991
planning to cheat on me
to get yourself a job?

36:18.992 --> 36:19.716
What are you doing?

36:19.717 --> 36:22.303
Why... why are you punishing me
for doing the right thing?!

36:22.304 --> 36:23.823
Nothing about this was the right thing!

36:31.492 --> 36:34.002
You asked me to, so I set this thing up,

36:34.003 --> 36:36.818
but I don't have any idea why
we're wasting our time out here.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.583
Would you just do the job
I pay you to do? Please?

36:49.015 --> 36:49.907
Steve, right?

36:50.713 --> 36:52.277
You enjoy your flight from Miami?

36:53.448 --> 36:55.344
Good. So here's the deal.

36:56.085 --> 36:58.216
Instead of you selling those
pictures to somebody else,

36:58.217 --> 37:01.250
You're gonna sell them to me.
The S.D. card, too.

37:03.541 --> 37:06.548
In addition, I'll make you my first call.

37:06.549 --> 37:08.224
The next ten times I go out.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.522
Seems like my picture's worth a
little bit of money nowadays.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.880
So... we have a deal?

37:14.261 --> 37:15.346
We have a deal...

37:19.798 --> 37:21.459
Even though you weren't
in the pictures at all.

37:21.701 --> 37:22.805
Well, then I guess you're gettin'

37:22.806 --> 37:24.208
the better end of this one.

37:32.808 --> 37:33.697
Let's go.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.650
Does the name Peggy Kenter sound familiar?

37:41.836 --> 37:42.646
Who is she?

37:43.611 --> 37:44.823
She's one of the belle meaders.

37:46.170 --> 37:47.894
Husband is some business guy.

37:51.580 --> 37:52.921
Is this as bad as it looks?

37:53.516 --> 37:54.821
I know an affair when I see one.

37:56.571 --> 37:58.327
Cheating husbands are my bread and butter.

38:03.435 --> 38:04.919
Teddy Conrad... a cheater?

38:17.992 --> 38:20.948
You finally learned to
respect my privacy, Makena?

38:23.959 --> 38:25.799
Hey. What are you doing here?

38:26.075 --> 38:30.099
No one's ever spent $25,000 on
some photographs for me before.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.616
Well, nobody's ever fought a paparazzo.

38:32.617 --> 38:34.195
To defend my honor before.

38:34.488 --> 38:37.093
Yeah, I think I do better
staying home on Friday nights.

38:37.962 --> 38:41.254
But I was, uh, wondering if, uh,

38:41.735 --> 38:45.122
maybe you wanted to stay,
um, home with me one night?

38:47.461 --> 38:48.740
Are you asking me out?

38:50.600 --> 38:51.956
I'm asking you in.

38:53.496 --> 38:54.326
Okay.

38:56.185 --> 38:58.210
Yeah. Sure. That sounds great.

38:59.191 --> 39:00.129
All right, then.

39:00.983 --> 39:03.491
I'll call you later...
About later hanging in?

39:03.808 --> 39:05.913
Okay. You do that.

39:27.349 --> 39:29.073
Who did this? Liam McGuinnis.

39:32.324 --> 39:34.130
Well, that's too bad.
We don't work with him.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.643
Well, now might be a good time.

39:36.644 --> 39:38.129
To think about making an exception.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.616
The answer's no.

39:37.180 --> 39:41.616
?I didn't have to see,

39:41.617 --> 39:42.574
you know, Marshall...

39:43.844 --> 39:45.151
I feel like you don't wanna work with him.

39:45.152 --> 39:47.201
Just 'cause he doesn't
wanna play your game.

39:47.376 --> 39:49.550
I mean, I'm not gonna change
my mind about what I wanna do.

39:49.551 --> 39:51.235
Just 'cause he told you
to go screw yourself.

39:51.236 --> 39:52.689
Five years ago at the V.M.As

39:52.690 --> 39:54.640
Why do you have to fight
me on everything, Rayna?

39:55.570 --> 39:56.751
I'm not fightin' you.

39:57.811 --> 39:59.296
I'm fightin' for what I believe in.

40:00.611 --> 40:02.814
He's my guy. This is my sound.

40:02.950 --> 40:04.070
If you don't like that,

40:04.071 --> 40:05.446
there are other labels in this town.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.411
Who would be more than happy
to buy out my contract.

40:08.826 --> 40:09.862
You wanna play dirty, Rayna?

40:09.863 --> 40:11.123
No, I do not.

40:11.895 --> 40:13.924
I wanna play my music.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.949
This is where I'm going.

40:17.991 --> 40:19.011
Get on board.

40:35.504 --> 40:36.511
I sat up all night,

40:38.223 --> 40:40.136
trying to figure out what
came next for Avery and I,

40:40.137 --> 40:41.126
and, um...

40:42.024 --> 40:44.003
I realized the answer was nothing.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.039
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you the whole thing.

40:46.040 --> 40:46.706
Right from the start.

40:46.707 --> 40:49.473
I mean, maybe it all would've...
Turned out different.

40:49.527 --> 40:50.388
No.

40:52.873 --> 40:54.321
He'd always been ambitious.

40:56.150 --> 40:57.267
Better to find out.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.925
That's more important to him than I am now.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.442
Rather than later.

41:03.847 --> 41:04.691
Guess so.

41:07.401 --> 41:09.156
You stay as long as you need to, you hear?

41:20.402 --> 41:21.761
Your numbers are up across the board.

41:21.762 --> 41:23.986
Calls to the office and
donations have tripled.

41:24.196 --> 41:24.960
That's great.

41:25.459 --> 41:27.411
Now listen, "the tennessean" called,

41:27.412 --> 41:28.655
asking if you wanna make a statement

41:28.656 --> 41:30.349
about Coleman's run-in with the police.

41:32.142 --> 41:33.050
Mr. Conrad?

41:34.509 --> 41:35.435
No comment.

41:35.478 --> 41:36.323
All right, then.

41:40.019 --> 41:40.866
They met at Vandy,

41:42.005 --> 41:44.244
and they dated for years
before he married Rayna.

41:46.485 --> 41:48.537
Now she's volunteering on the campaign.

41:48.922 --> 41:50.089
These pictures leak out...

41:50.920 --> 41:52.372
It's gonna ruin his marriage.

41:53.306 --> 41:54.613
Rayna'll never forgive me.

41:55.050 --> 41:57.498
You don't owe Rayna or her family anything.

41:57.499 --> 41:59.063
After the way they've treated you.

41:59.772 --> 42:02.311
Teddy Conrad doesn't deserve
to be mayor of this town.

42:02.649 --> 42:03.543
So what now?

42:03.914 --> 42:05.042
Just leak these pictures and...

42:05.411 --> 42:06.643
What, let the chips fall?

42:09.188 --> 42:10.464
No, it feels wrong.

42:11.042 --> 42:13.616
Sometimes you have to do a little wrong.

42:14.003 --> 42:15.424
To do a greater good.

42:27.973 --> 42:28.880
Hey.
