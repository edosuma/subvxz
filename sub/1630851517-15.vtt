00:01.101 --> 00:03.636
{\an5}<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:01.101 --> 00:03.636
I'm Georgie.

00:03.703 --> 00:04.771
Mandy.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.106
How about while this runs,

00:06.172 --> 00:07.207
I take you to dinner?

00:07.273 --> 00:08.708
How old are you?

00:08.775 --> 00:10.310
GEORGE JR.:
<i>Do not say 17.</i>

00:10.377 --> 00:11.611
Twenty-one.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.447
Well, funny seeing you here.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.349
I'm just taking
a little dinner break.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.451
Here we go. Two margaritas.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.520
I love their margaritas.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.189
Well, this was fun.

00:23.256 --> 00:24.724
It was for me.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.526
Nice meeting you.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.202
I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

00:36.269 --> 00:38.204
but the strength
of the temperature deviations

00:38.271 --> 00:40.206
is looking rather spicy.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.375
{\an4}How spicy?

00:40.273 --> 00:42.375
Five microkelvin.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.377
{\an8}<i>Muy caliente.</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.377
{\an8}(chuckles)

00:44.444 --> 00:45.612
When should we publish?

00:45.678 --> 00:47.280
Not yet. There's only

00:47.347 --> 00:49.649
a three-sigma significance.
It needs to be higher.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.652
{\an3}That'd require a much
more robust signal.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.154
{\an1}And you know
what that means.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.489
Road trip to the
super telescope?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.625
{\an1}Road trip
to the super telescope, baby.

00:58.691 --> 00:59.826
When are we leaving?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.163
Oh, right. You.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.766
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:06.833 --> 01:09.636

01:14.674 --> 01:18.845

01:21.581 --> 01:25.185
{\an8}So far, the data
is extremely promising.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.387
{\an8}Five microkelvin!

01:27.454 --> 01:28.421
{\an8}HAGEMEYER: Ah.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.156
{\an8}Well, you seem excited,

01:30.223 --> 01:31.591
{\an8}so... cool.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.259
{\an9}(chuckles)
We just need

01:33.326 --> 01:35.462
{\an8}budget approval
to travel to the radio telescope

01:35.528 --> 01:36.529
{\an8}in the Davis Mountains.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.697
{\an8}Fine by me.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.400
{\an7}Yes!

01:37.764 --> 01:40.400
{\an8}On to more pressing matters.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.203
{\an8}Does Sheldon Cooper
have to come?

01:40.467 --> 01:43.203
{\an5}STURGIS: Shouldn't he?

01:43.269 --> 01:44.704
{\an8}He is part of the team.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.674
{\an8}But isn't there some rule
against minors traveling?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.676
{\an8}No.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.676
{\an8}Can there be?

01:49.742 --> 01:52.145
{\an8}No, it's better for the project
if he's out there

01:52.212 --> 01:53.613
{\an8}in the field with you.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.114
{\an8}But isn't it better
for his education

01:55.181 --> 01:57.283
{\an8}if he stays here in class?

01:55.181 --> 01:57.283
{\an8}HAGEMEYER: Oh, I think

01:57.350 --> 01:59.152
{\an8}that a trip like this
could be very educational

01:59.219 --> 02:00.720
{\an8}in its own way.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.720
{\an8}LINKLETTER: Mm.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.189
{\an8}You just don't want him
around here bugging you.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.725
{\an8}Winner winner
he's-going-with-you dinner.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.566
{\an8}Hey, there.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.269
{\an8}You're Georgie's friend, right?

02:16.336 --> 02:18.304
{\an8}Yeah. Mandy. Hi.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.304
{\an7}(chuckles)

02:18.371 --> 02:20.740
{\an8}You grow up around here?

02:18.371 --> 02:20.740
{\an9}I did,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.842
{\an8}yeah. And then I, uh,
moved to San Antonio

02:22.909 --> 02:24.310
{\an8}for a while after college.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.913
{\an8}After college.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.913
{\an9}Yeah.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.316
{\an8}A&amp;M. Then I got an internship
at <i> Good Morning San Antonio.</i>

02:30.383 --> 02:31.718
{\an8}Uh-oh.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.718
{\an8}MANDY: Then I worked my way up

02:31.784 --> 02:33.453
{\an7}to doing
the morning weather report.

02:31.784 --> 02:33.453
{\an5}Hey, y'all.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.721
{\an7}Well,

02:34.787 --> 02:36.723
{\an8}speak of the devil.

02:36.789 --> 02:38.925
{\an8}What's going on, ladies?

02:36.789 --> 02:38.925
{\an8}MEEMAW: Just

02:38.992 --> 02:40.727
{\an8}getting to know Mandy here.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.196
{\an8}Yeah, I was telling her
about San Antonio.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.665
{\an9}Oh, she's from Texas. She
knows all about that stuff.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.268
{\an8}Anyways, I'll let you
get back to work.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.268
{\an5}MEEMAW: Well,

02:48.334 --> 02:49.736
{\an8}I'll leave you two kids be.

02:49.802 --> 02:52.939
{\an8}And listen to me,
calling you young adults "kids."

02:53.006 --> 02:57.644
{\an8}(chuckles) Like you were
still teenagers or something.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.279
{\an8}I wish.
(chuckles)

03:02.949 --> 03:04.884
{\an8}Mom, can I have your AAA card?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.786
{\an8}Why?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.786
{\an8}I need to order

03:06.853 --> 03:09.289
{\an8}a TripTik
for my road trip to Fort Davis.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.224
{\an8}Who said you could
go to Fort Davis?

03:11.291 --> 03:12.492
{\an8}President Hagemeyer.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.761
{\an8}Well, I didn't say you could go.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.363
{\an8}It's fine. I'll be with
Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.698
{\an8}For how long?

03:18.765 --> 03:19.799
{\an8}Three days.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.634
{\an8}And they're okay with this?

03:21.701 --> 03:22.969
{\an8}Why wouldn't they be?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.771
{\an8}No reason.

03:24.837 --> 03:25.905
{\an8}Hmm.

03:24.837 --> 03:25.905
{\an8}Just the same,

03:25.972 --> 03:27.640
{\an8}I'm gonna check in with them.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.509
{\an8}In the meantime, can I call AAA?

03:29.576 --> 03:32.245
{\an8}Can it please wait?

03:29.576 --> 03:32.245
{\an8}No.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.615
{\an8}(sighs) Card is in my purse.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.351
{\an8}You're what guys call
"a keeper."

03:46.359 --> 03:48.661
{\an8}Mandy seems nice.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.929
{\an8}She's all right.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.664
{\an8}Things getting serious?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.700
{\an8}I don't know. Why?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.700
{\an8}Just wondering

03:53.766 --> 03:56.402
{\an8}when you were gonna tell her
your real age.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.571
{\an8}Age ain't nothing but a number.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.571
{\an7}Yeah,

03:58.638 --> 04:01.474
{\an8}well, her number's
way bigger than your number.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.309
You ain't never lied
about your age?

04:03.376 --> 04:04.944
I'm a lady. Different rules.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.847
{\an5}It's not a big deal.
We're just having fun.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.847
{\an1}Yeah,

04:07.914 --> 04:09.649
well, before you have
too much fun,

04:09.716 --> 04:10.950
you better tell her.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.852
That sounds less fun.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.687
Welcome to being an adult.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.555
It sucks.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.760
Dr. Linkletter? Mary Cooper.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.428
Ah, Mrs. Cooper.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.464
I assume
this is about the upcoming trip

04:24.530 --> 04:26.933
and perhaps your
very understandable reluctance

04:27.000 --> 04:28.568
to let Sheldon come.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.838
I have to admit
I do have some concerns.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.473
As you should.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.540
So, you're saying you'd prefer

04:34.607 --> 04:36.376
{\an5}he not go with us?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.376
(Mary sighs)

04:36.442 --> 04:38.878
But he'd be so disappointed.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.847
Not more disappointed than me.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.916
So, you feel good
about him going?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.919
Only if you feel good about it.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.756
You're his parent. I'm just
an absentminded academic

04:49.822 --> 04:51.457
who's never had children.

04:51.524 --> 04:52.759
Come on, now.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.327
You've been such a great help

04:54.394 --> 04:56.462
looking after him at college.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.465
Yes, but college isn't the same
as three days in a van.

04:59.532 --> 05:00.600
Huh.

05:00.667 --> 05:03.369
Sheldon can be
a nervous traveler.

05:03.436 --> 05:06.606
Ah. Sounds like
you don't want him to go.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.075
No, I do want him to go.
I just want to make sure

05:09.142 --> 05:12.045
that you and Dr. Sturgis
are okay with it.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.881
We're okay with it.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.050
If you're okay with it.

05:17.116 --> 05:19.419
If you're okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.055
Then it would seem
we're both okay with it.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.056
Okay.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.358
{\an5}Okay.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.358
MARY: Oh,

05:25.425 --> 05:26.959
he's gonna be so happy.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.028
Uh-huh.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.704
{\an1}You ready
for your road trip?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.806
Yes. I'm plotting
bathroom breaks.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.074
It's tricky because I'm not sure

05:41.140 --> 05:44.377
how frequently Dr. Linkletter
and Dr. Sturgis need to urinate.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.379
Maybe I should call them.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.514
Ooh, I wouldn't. You ask
old guys about their bladder,

05:48.581 --> 05:50.583
you're in for
a long conversation.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.818
What's with the maps?

05:51.884 --> 05:53.920
{\an3}I'm going with Dr. Sturgis
and Dr. Linkletter

05:53.986 --> 05:56.456
to a radio telescope
in the Davis Mountains.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.890
{\an3}(sighs)
Of course you are.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.593
{\an4}Problem?

05:57.957 --> 06:00.593
Nope. He gets to do

06:00.660 --> 06:02.361
{\an3}whatever he wants, and
I'm not even allowed

06:02.428 --> 06:03.863
to go the beach
with my friends.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.698
It's just a school trip.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.700
{\an3}It's fine.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.936
{\an1}SHELDON:
Oh. Says here Fort Stockton

06:10.002 --> 06:11.971
is home to the world's
largest roadrunner statue,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.539
which is the stuff
of nightmares.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.608
But they do have a restroom.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.844
(knock on door)

06:17.910 --> 06:19.679
Can I talk to you?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.547
{\an5}Am I in trouble?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.547
{\an3}No.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.582
It's about a girl.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.517
Oh.<i> You're</i> in trouble.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.651
Yeah, sure.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.888
I'm not really in trouble.
I'm just dating this girl,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.556
and she's a little older
than me.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.091
What's the problem?

06:32.158 --> 06:34.894
She doesn't exactly know
how much older than me she is.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.562
How much older is she?

06:36.629 --> 06:37.764
Like ten years.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.633
But she's blond
and she's really hot.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.668
Well, that doesn't matter.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.605
I mean, if you're lying to her,
that's not okay.

06:45.671 --> 06:46.806
Hold on.

06:46.873 --> 06:49.442
You're saying if you were my age
and dating this hot girl,

06:49.509 --> 06:51.711
you'd tell her the truth
and blow your chances?

06:51.778 --> 06:54.046
Well, that's not the question
you asked me.

06:54.113 --> 06:55.715
So, what would you really do?

06:55.782 --> 06:57.617
(exhales)

06:57.683 --> 06:59.018
She married?

06:59.085 --> 07:00.119
{\an5}No.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.119
She got kids?

07:00.186 --> 07:01.854
{\an5}No.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.854
I don't see the problem.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.723
{\an5}Thank you.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.723
My pleasure.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.725
You're like the son
I never wanted.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.830
Hey, I know
I don't work here anymore,

07:10.897 --> 07:12.999
but could I use
this office tonight?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.133
No.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.468
Fine.

07:15.535 --> 07:16.536
Did you used to?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.206
(scoffs softly)
No.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.179
You might want to pace yourself.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.147
Our next rest stop
isn't for another...

07:28.214 --> 07:30.016
62 miles.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.018
If anyone needs to go
before that,

07:32.084 --> 07:33.586
{\an3}I've got a trucker's
buddy in back.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.720
What's that?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.489
A bottle you urinate in.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.557
{\an1}I'm sorry,

07:37.623 --> 07:39.225
are we the Donner Party?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.160
Societal norms are different
on road trips.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.629
Normally, I don't eat junk food,

07:43.696 --> 07:46.499
but here, it's tradition.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.769
I'm not even sure
what a chicharron is.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.838
{\an1}It's the deep-fried skin
of a pig.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.907
That seems like something
they should say on the bag.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.542
How about some music?

07:56.609 --> 07:58.177
{\an1}No one likes music.
How about a car game?

07:58.244 --> 08:00.513
{\an1}Ooh, I have a fun one
where I say

08:00.580 --> 08:02.582
a formula, and then you have
to say another formula

08:02.648 --> 08:04.183
starting with the last letter
or number

08:04.250 --> 08:06.519
{\an4}that I said.
So, for example, if I said,

08:04.250 --> 08:06.519
(Linkletter groans)

08:06.586 --> 08:08.721
{\an5}"X" equals negative "B"
plus or minus...

08:06.586 --> 08:08.721
Music it is.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.756
(classical music playing)

08:14.260 --> 08:17.730
I'm sorry I can't help out
on driving duty.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.066
{\an5}You really never learned?

08:17.797 --> 08:20.066
{\an1}I got

08:20.132 --> 08:23.536
my permit, but I've never been
comfortable behind the wheel.

08:23.603 --> 08:24.704
That's a shame.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.573
I do enjoy the tranquility
of the open road.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.543
I find it produces
a Zen-like calm.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.978
Mm.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.679
{\an1}You know what else
is calming?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.014
A fun car game.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.215
How about this.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.017
We'll count
out-of-state license plates.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.885
First one to a hundred wins.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.953
Not as fun as mine,
but very well.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.289
Um... Ooh, Oklahoma.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.790
Silently.

08:47.793 --> 08:50.129
(crunching)

08:55.902 --> 08:58.237
{\an5}(TV playing indistinctly)

08:55.902 --> 08:58.237
(door opens, closes)

09:00.306 --> 09:02.241
Hey. Is your mom home?

09:02.308 --> 09:03.576
Church.

09:03.643 --> 09:04.911
Oh. What are you up to?

09:04.977 --> 09:06.779
Nothing.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.916
Put your shoes on.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.584
Why?

09:11.651 --> 09:13.252
Let's you and me
go do something fun.

09:13.319 --> 09:16.255
Something I think is fun
or something you think is fun?

09:16.322 --> 09:19.191
Something we both think is fun.
Come on, get in the truck.

09:19.258 --> 09:21.861
{\an5}You gonna teach me how to drive?

09:19.258 --> 09:21.861
No.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.330
You sure? It would just
make me feel so much better

09:24.397 --> 09:28.267
{\an5}about all the stuff
Sheldon gets to do.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.267
You're not driving.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.270
{\an5}I would seriously love you
so much if I could drive.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.270
Stop it.

09:31.337 --> 09:35.207
{\an1}At what age do guys
stop acting like idiots?

09:35.274 --> 09:36.943
Oh, no. What'd I do now?

09:37.009 --> 09:38.911
Not you. Georgie's

09:38.978 --> 09:41.948
{\an1}dating an older woman
and he's lying about his age.

09:42.014 --> 09:45.284
Oh. That rascal.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.652
You already knew.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.187
You don't know what I know.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.755
I see it in your face.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.792
{\an3}(sighs) Fine. Well, he
asked for my advice.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.962
Well, I hope you told him
that he has to come clean.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.631
{\an3}I did.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.200
Sounds like there's
a "but" on the way.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.170
(sighs) But then he asked
me what I would've done.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.671
{\an4}Dale.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.671
{\an3}Well, uh,

10:05.738 --> 10:07.173
you don't know
all the facts.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.641
What are the facts?

10:08.708 --> 10:10.109
{\an3}(clears throat)
He said

10:10.176 --> 10:12.645
that she was blond and hot.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.914
And that makes it okay to lie?

10:14.981 --> 10:16.615
At my age, no.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.718
{\an3}At his age?

10:19.986 --> 10:22.054
{\an3}No.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.223
{\an6}STURGIS:

like this for a while?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.758
{\an3}It's Texas.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.661
{\an3}Goes straight like this
for the rest of our lives.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.329
You thinking of
giving it a try?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.099
Well, there aren't
any cars around.

10:33.165 --> 10:36.669
Uh, seems like a good place
to practice.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.271
{\an3}Excellent. I could
use a break.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.007
This is exciting.

10:41.073 --> 10:42.742
I'm all atingle.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.044
You are not peeing in a bottle.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.349

10:49.148 --> 10:50.349

10:50.416 --> 10:52.752

10:52.818 --> 10:54.253
You love this place.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.022
{\an3}Holy moly.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.089
It's good, huh?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.257
Unbelievable.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.259
{\an1}Yeah, when I was,
like, eight.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.229
{\an3}Well, come on, we had our first
daddy-daughter date here.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.731
{\an1}Oh, my God,
don't ever call it that again.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.099
{\an3}What?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.101
{\an1}I have friends
who come here on actual dates.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.137
They might see us.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.840
Thought it'd be nice.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.108
(indistinct chatter)

11:16.175 --> 11:18.044
{\an1}Can we please go
anywhere else?

11:18.110 --> 11:20.880
{\an3}(sighs)
Fine.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.117
{\an6}You know, they have
those cheddar biscuits.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.117
{\an1}Dad.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.019
{\an6}Fine.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.019
(engine starts)

11:27.086 --> 11:28.421
{\an8}STURGIS: <i> I'm doing it.</i>

11:28.487 --> 11:30.389
This is going quite well.

11:30.456 --> 11:31.991
Feel free to pick up the pace.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.393
{\an5}A butterfly just passed us.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.393
STURGIS: Well,

11:34.460 --> 11:37.029
{\an5}what's the speed limit?

11:34.460 --> 11:37.029
75.

11:37.096 --> 11:39.765
And I'm going...

11:39.832 --> 11:40.800
{\an3}ten.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.169
{\an8}<i>I'll pick up the pace.</i>

11:43.235 --> 11:44.870
{\an3}Speaking of slow-moving
transportation,

11:44.937 --> 11:47.106
{\an3}did you know that the slowest
express train in the world

11:47.173 --> 11:49.175
{\an3}is the Glacier Express
in Switzerland?

11:49.241 --> 11:51.077
I spent a month
in Switzerland at CERN.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.478
{\an5}(thud)

11:51.143 --> 11:52.478
STURGIS: Oh, no!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.480
I hit an armadillo.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.015
So? Just keep driving.

{\an5}(seat belt clicks)

11:56.082 --> 11:57.016
STURGIS: No,

11:57.083 --> 11:59.452

12:00.553 --> 12:03.022
{\an5}(car door closes)

12:00.553 --> 12:03.022
{\an3}Is he hoping it's
alive or dead?

12:03.089 --> 12:04.423
Alive.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.958
{\an3}Ugh.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.301
Oh, no, what have I done?

12:15.367 --> 12:17.303
It's still moving.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.337
Like we should be. Let's go.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.773
We need a box and a towel.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.808
We don't need a coffin.
The birds will eat it.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.845
It's to keep it safe
until we find help.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.047
John, these animals
carry all kinds of diseases.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.416
That's what the towel's for.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.084
This is Texas.
Armadillo roadkill

12:32.151 --> 12:33.919
is practically the state animal.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.890
So, where you want to go?

12:37.957 --> 12:40.793
I am up for anything.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.429
I was thinking the bar,
but I go there so much.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.164
What about a movie?

12:45.231 --> 12:49.368
{\an1}Or we could just go back
to your place.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.170
{\an3}Oh.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.972
That-That'd be amazing.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.974
Well, amazing's

16:24.583 --> 16:26.151
{\an1}and he's gonna
do the right thing.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.519
{\an1}DALE:
Connie, the second

16:27.586 --> 16:30.055
{\an3}that girl's shirt comes
off, it's game over.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.024
No. My grandson has

16:32.091 --> 16:34.059
{\an1}more integrity
than you're giving him credit...

16:35.194 --> 16:36.528
{\an3}GEORGE JR.:
Amazing.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.130
{\an3}(exhales)

16:38.197 --> 16:39.665
Boy, I am stuffed.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.468
{\an1}You know, if you're too full
to drive, I could help.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.703
You're not driving my truck.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.572
{\an1}Come on.
Just here in the parking lot?

16:46.638 --> 16:47.673
{\an3}No.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.508
Please, Daddy?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.212
I know what you're doing.

16:53.278 --> 16:56.281
{\an1}Creating memories
that'll last a lifetime?

16:56.348 --> 16:59.084
{\an3}(exhales)

17:00.352 --> 17:02.554
Okay. Foot on the brake.

17:02.621 --> 17:05.290
Which one's that?

17:05.357 --> 17:08.327
{\an1}Oh, boy.
The one on the left.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.561
{\an5}Got it.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.561
All right. Now

17:10.628 --> 17:12.564
pull the shifter toward you

17:12.631 --> 17:15.099
{\an1}and then down to "D,"
like this. Here.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.769
{\an5}(gear shifts)

17:15.166 --> 17:16.769
{\an1}All right?

17:16.835 --> 17:19.070
Now, the most important step.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.741
{\an1}Do not ever
tell your mother we did this.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.443
I'm not an idiot. Let's go.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.444
{\an1}(sighs)
All right. Now

17:26.512 --> 17:28.113
take your foot off the brake

17:28.180 --> 17:29.782
{\an5}and gently put it on the...

17:28.180 --> 17:29.782
(tires screech)

17:29.848 --> 17:31.717
<i>MISSY:</i>
<i>(laughs) I'm driving!</i>

17:36.855 --> 17:37.923
I know you're
a human hospital,

17:37.990 --> 17:42.161
but the animal hospital
isn't answering their phone.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.831
{\an3}Well, is there a doctor who
has a soft spot for pets?

17:45.898 --> 17:49.535
{\an1}Maybe a nurse with pictures
of cats on her desk?

17:49.601 --> 17:51.670
You can hang up the phone, John.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.405
{\an3}Why?

17:53.472 --> 17:55.441
I think you know why.

17:55.507 --> 17:58.844
♪ But only would I... ♪

17:58.911 --> 18:01.613
Thank you for your time.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.187
Well, that's a shame.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.688
I'm sorry.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.825
It's just an armadillo, right?

18:12.891 --> 18:15.194
{\an3}It didn't seem that way
to you in the van.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.830
I know it's silly, but...

18:17.896 --> 18:21.700
{\an1}when I saw it lying there
all bald and helpless,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.769
{\an1}I thought,

18:23.836 --> 18:26.205
"That's gonna be me one day."

18:27.706 --> 18:31.243
That is the most damn depressing
thing I have ever heard.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.214
The end of life
does tend to be depressing.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.116
In New Orleans, they embrace
the tradition of a jazz funeral

18:38.183 --> 18:40.552
where the deceased
are celebrated through music.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.488
That's true.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.623
Barkeep, do you happen to have

18:44.690 --> 18:46.692
{\an1}any Dixieland jazz
on the jukebox

18:46.758 --> 18:49.862
{\an1}to celebrate the life
of an armadillo?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.897
Y'all need to leave now.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.765
