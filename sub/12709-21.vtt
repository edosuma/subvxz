00:01.000 --> 00:02.903
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:02.936 --> 00:04.804
-Hey.
-Hello, Faith.

00:04.838 --> 00:07.006
Trying to turn
a bunch of little girls
into an army.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.510
They're potential Slayers
 just like we were.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.778
Call me Caleb.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.219
-(screaming)
-BUFFY: Xander!

00:18.251 --> 00:20.019
Look, I'm not saying
it's a happy scenario,

00:20.053 --> 00:22.756
but we're dealing with
a big bad that can be
any dead person it wants.

00:22.789 --> 00:25.158
BUFFY:
The bad guys always go
where the power is.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.495
They're protecting the vineyard,
or something at the vineyard.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.364
You realize what will happen
if the Slayer and her girls
get it, don't you?

00:30.397 --> 00:32.100
They won't.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.603
We have to be together on this,
so I need you to leave.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.570
Now I'm your boss.

00:37.604 --> 00:39.906
And there's only one thing
I've ever been sure of.

00:39.939 --> 00:42.109
You.
You're the one, Buffy.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.612
(crashing)

00:44.645 --> 00:45.646
Heard you got
something of mine.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.585
Those of you who are coming
with me to the arsenal,
you know who you are.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.220
Let's do this thing.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.621
(grunts)

00:56.457 --> 00:58.892
(beeping)

00:58.926 --> 01:00.561
Get down!

01:10.103 --> 01:12.373
-(clattering)
-CALEB: So...

01:12.406 --> 01:14.575
you found it.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.644
Not impressed.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.313
'Cause the question now,
girlie girl, is can you
pry it from solid rock

01:19.347 --> 01:20.781
before I come over there and--

01:22.983 --> 01:25.385
(nervous chuckle)

01:25.418 --> 01:28.322
(clears throat)

01:28.355 --> 01:30.623
Darn.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.628
(theme music playing)

02:28.649 --> 02:32.118
Now, before you go hurtin'
yourself with that thing,

02:32.151 --> 02:35.288
why don't you do yourself
a courtesy and hand it over now?

02:35.323 --> 02:37.824
Yeah? You want it?

02:40.894 --> 02:42.896
You don't even know
what you got there.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.031
I know you're backing away.

02:50.871 --> 02:54.707
You think wieldin'
some two-sided doodad's
gonna make a difference?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.576
Let her go, Caleb.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.147
-I said, let her go.
-I let her go,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.883
she slices me open
with that thing.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.987
No, she doesn't.
She hasn't got time.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.391
She has friends,
and her friends are in trouble.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.526
Faith go boom.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.896
I'm not lettin' her
out of here with that thing.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.198
FIRST/BUFFY:
Sure you are.

03:18.231 --> 03:22.068
Then you'll come back
for it later...
when she's got her back turned.

03:44.557 --> 03:48.127
Hey!
Hey, Faith? Anybody?

03:48.161 --> 03:51.230
-Is anybody here?
-(coughing) Me.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.605
-Is anybody else alive?
-(clattering)

03:58.639 --> 04:02.209
-Hello? Anyone?
-VI: Yeah!

04:02.241 --> 04:05.078
I'm-- (coughing)
I'm here!

04:13.320 --> 04:15.155
-Who else we got?
-Don't know.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.190
-You okay?
-I think my arm is broken.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.096
I guess I'm lucky.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.101
Where's Faith?

04:29.136 --> 04:32.072
-Don't know.
-Maybe we should
get the hell out of this place.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.874
-They could be--
-Find her!

04:35.975 --> 04:38.110
-Oh, God!
-Is she alive?

04:38.144 --> 04:39.779
-Breathing. Pulse.
-We gotta get her out of here!

04:39.812 --> 04:41.981
-Which way is out?
-There's other girls.
There's more than Faith.

04:42.014 --> 04:46.319
-We don't even know how many
of us are still... alive.
-(guttural growling)

04:46.353 --> 04:48.288
-What was that?
-It could have been
grinding metal.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.024
-It could have been--
-No. It was one of them.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.159
-That's not possible.
-How'd it get in here?

04:53.192 --> 04:55.228
-Our plans?
-Run.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.706
It's blocked!
Oh, my God!

05:05.738 --> 05:08.608
-I told you
this wasn't the way!
-(voices overlapping)

05:08.641 --> 05:10.577
KENNEDY:
Up and over!
Wounded first! Let's go!

05:42.274 --> 05:43.877
-(growling)
-(all screaming)

05:45.913 --> 05:47.814
Group together.
Form a circle.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.149
Nobody panic.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.685
It's all of us, one of him.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.286
We can take one of these things.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.526
ANDREW:
It was pretty amazing.

05:58.558 --> 06:03.096
The whole grocery store
was just abandoned,
food lying around everywhere.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.031
Well, the produce was on its way
to Funky Town, but--

06:05.064 --> 06:07.166
Oh! Jaffa Cakes.

06:07.199 --> 06:09.403
Um, the apples still looked
pretty good,

06:09.437 --> 06:11.271
so everyone should, uh,
check those out.

06:11.303 --> 06:13.240
(door opens)

06:15.208 --> 06:18.110
-Did you find Buffy?
-No.

06:18.144 --> 06:22.115
But you did that spell
with the little lights
and the locator?

06:22.149 --> 06:25.084
-It crapped out
on us though.
-No, it didn't, exactly.

06:25.117 --> 06:27.521
It just took us
to an empty house.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.288
She must've
moved on already.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.793
I'm afraid we have, uh,
slightly worse news here.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.630
Faith hasn't returned
with the other girls.
Something's gone wrong.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.266
I've been here
keeping morale up,

06:40.300 --> 06:42.636
because that's important.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.637
We have to go to her.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.774
-Guess so.
-ANDREW: Yes.

06:46.807 --> 06:51.011
I'll stay here, keep working
on that morale thing.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.351
Remember the training.
Everybody, get ready!

07:01.254 --> 07:04.124
(screaming)

07:04.156 --> 07:07.160
-There's another one!
-Move, move, move, move!
Up and over!

07:07.194 --> 07:09.930
Not that one!
That one!

07:09.963 --> 07:11.831
-(growls)
-(all screaming)

07:17.838 --> 07:19.540
Weapons! Over there!

07:35.154 --> 07:36.856
(loud thud)

08:10.423 --> 08:12.526
Get the wounded.
We're leaving.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.495
-Are there more?
-There's always more.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.363
Let's move.

08:23.536 --> 08:27.339
Wil, come here.
She's losing a lot of blood.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.276
I got it.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.847
-The room upstairs
is ready for her.
-Good. I hope we're in time.

08:34.881 --> 08:37.049
Is she okay?
Is she gonna be okay?

08:37.083 --> 08:38.818
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Right?

08:38.851 --> 08:41.187
-Careful!
-Just mind her head.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.322
I'll be up in a second.

08:43.355 --> 08:46.092
You guys heal fast, right?
You Slayers?

08:46.125 --> 08:49.596
-Yeah.
-So she'll be okay?

08:49.629 --> 08:52.865
-I don't know.
-What's with the ax thing?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.537
I took it from Caleb.
It might be important.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.606
Let's hope.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.575
I think we got punished.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.076
What?

09:03.110 --> 09:05.745
We, uh--

09:05.778 --> 09:08.816
-We followed her, and it was--
-It didn't work out.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.285
You guys, it was a trap.
It's not her fault.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.522
That could have just as easily
happened to me.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.256
So are you--
Are you, like, back?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.061
I don't know.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.532
-I guess I'm not leaving.
-So we got a plan now
or anything?

09:25.565 --> 09:28.168
Yeah, there's a plan.
Get ready. Time's up.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.337
I still think we got punished.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.245
-XANDER: Is she breathing okay?
-Still unconscious though.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.750
We've still got work to do.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.254
I think it's maybe
some kind of scythe.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.557
The only thing I know for sure
is it made Caleb
back off in a hurry.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.994
So it's true.
Scythe matters.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.263
I'm ignoring that.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.231
I'd just like to point out--
this is really quite ingenious.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.134
Kills strong bodies three ways.

10:02.635 --> 10:06.572
-And you say you sense something
when you hold it?
-Not much.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.976
But it's strong,
and I knew it belonged to me.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.443
I just knew it.

10:11.477 --> 10:14.614
In addition to being ancient,
it's clearly mystical.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.817
Yeah, I figured that one out
when I King Arthur'd it
out of the stone.

10:17.850 --> 10:22.221
So maybe it's like some kind
of traditional Slayer weapon.

10:24.456 --> 10:26.359
I can't imagine
how something like this
could exist without--

10:26.393 --> 10:28.528
without my having heard of it.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.198
Well, the good guys
are not traditionally known
for their communication skills.

10:34.366 --> 10:37.169
Right. Um, any chance

10:37.203 --> 10:40.506
that it might be something
other than a tool
for killing things?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.344
The First's guys clearly
wanted it out of that stone.

10:44.376 --> 10:47.681
It's not just a tool.
It's important.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.383
We need to find out
whatever we can--
who made it, when,

10:50.417 --> 10:54.053
why, does it have a name,
I don't know, a credit report.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.024
-Just find out fast.
-We'll start work immediately.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.559
Don't worry, Buff.
We'll find out everything
there is to know.

11:00.592 --> 11:03.129
Good. Because right now,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.097
that thing's all we got
goin' for us.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.668
I like the real bandages better.

11:09.702 --> 11:13.072
These bed sheets
are awfully festive.
(groans)

11:13.105 --> 11:16.809
Yeah. They're gonna look like
mortally wounded Easter baskets.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.610
-What?
-Oh.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.380
H-Hey!

11:21.413 --> 11:24.717
We're supposed to use that
to sterilize wounds.
Mr. Giles said.

11:24.751 --> 11:29.355
-Come on.
What does it really matter?
-Hmm. Good point.

11:29.389 --> 11:33.493
-Giles knows
his single-malt antiseptics.
-(groans)

11:33.525 --> 11:36.428
Everything's horrible.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.899
Yep.
Many of these girls will die.

11:39.932 --> 11:42.168
A slaughterhouse is what it is.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.072
-What?
-Oh.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.673
Trying to talk
will just kill you sooner.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.677
We need supplies,
and not just bandages and junk.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.447
These-These girls need
stitches and painkillers.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.784
Yeah, well,
I could use a cookie,

11:57.817 --> 11:59.787
but I'm not making
reckless wishes.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.688
No, no.
We can do it.

12:02.721 --> 12:06.558
The hospital,
it's gotta be all abandoned
like the grocery store.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.261
Supplies just lying around
for the taking.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.500
I'm going in.

12:16.568 --> 12:18.971
-You are?
-And you're coming with me.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.908
I am?

12:21.942 --> 12:25.278
Well, I think you should drive,
'cause that scotch made me
a little dizzy.

12:26.980 --> 12:30.283
Okay. I'll get Kennedy
to watch the girls.
She's tough.

12:30.317 --> 12:33.753
-Imminent death
won't bother her.
-What?

12:33.787 --> 12:36.123
BUFFY:
You got it?

12:36.155 --> 12:39.326
Wait. I'm not
to the "got it" place yet.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.727
I'm still in the neighborhood of
"You've gotta be kidding."

12:41.760 --> 12:44.264
-You know
it's for the good.
-I don't.

12:44.297 --> 12:48.802
Buffy, do you get that?
If I do this,
that's it for me for this fight.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.071
I feel like you're puttin' me
out to pasture.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.941
Of course I'm not
putting you out to pasture.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.143
-What does that even mean?
-Well, you know,

12:56.176 --> 13:00.013
it's like, uh,
when a cow gets old
and loses an eye...

13:00.047 --> 13:02.414
or its ability to be milked.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.152
The farmer takes it and puts it
in a different pasture,

13:05.184 --> 13:08.922
so it won't have to...
fight...

13:08.956 --> 13:11.658
with the priest.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.793
Look, I don't need you
to protect me.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.263
I'm not.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.265
I got hurt, but I'm not done.
I can still fight.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.836
I know. That's why
I need you to do this.

13:23.870 --> 13:28.640
Xander, I need someone
that I can count on
no matter what happens.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.344
I just always thought
that I would--

13:31.378 --> 13:35.315
that I would be there with you,
you know, for the end.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.118
-Hey!
-Well, not that this is the end.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.019
-Thanks a lot.
-No, no, no, no.

13:40.052 --> 13:43.456
By "the end," I-I meant, uh,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.993
a heroic and uplifting way.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.161
See, I'm still optimistic.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.097
You're just thrown off
a little by this
gritty-looking eye patch.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.902
I know what you meant.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.570
I should be at your side.
That's all I'm sayin'.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.874
You will be.

14:00.908 --> 14:04.878
You're my strength, Xander.
You're the reason
I made it this far.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.514
I trust you with my life.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.951
So I need you
to do this for me.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.524
Okay.

14:18.557 --> 14:21.727
Also, you can't shoot
a bow and arrow anymore. And
every time you pick up a sword,

14:21.760 --> 14:23.663
-I worry that you're gonna break
one of our good lamps.
-Hey!

14:23.696 --> 14:26.732
Don't look at me.
You're the one who said
I'm gonna die.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.067
I never said you were gonna die.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.070
I-I implied that
you were gonna die.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.373
-It's totally different.
-Yeah, okay. Sure.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.676
Besides, if you die, I'll just
bring you back to life.
That's what I do.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.611
WILLOW:
Okay, before the vineyard
was just, you know, a vineyard,

14:39.645 --> 14:41.681
it was a monastery.

14:41.713 --> 14:43.515
It could've been
put there then.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.519
Some creepy monks
messing with powers
they don't understand.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.190
No, it's older than that.
It's-It's pre-Christian.

14:50.222 --> 14:54.793
Okay, well, I found reference
to stories the monks used
to tell about something older.

14:54.826 --> 14:57.397
Uh, like, uh,
some kind of pagan temple?

14:57.429 --> 15:00.700
-Native American?
-No. I don't know.

15:00.732 --> 15:04.136
(groans)
Okay, maybe we're just
going about this the wrong way.

15:04.171 --> 15:08.375
Maybe we should
research the weapon itself.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.043
Like look, maybe
it's the Axe of Dekeron,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.913
said to have been forged
in hell itself.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.548
Lost since
the Children's Crusade,

15:16.582 --> 15:20.287
where it was said
to have killed--
oh, children.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.754
I hope that's not it.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.825
I have reference to
the Sword of Moskva,

15:25.857 --> 15:28.794
the, uh,
Reaper of the Tigris.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.630
I mean, how are we supposed
to narrow this down?

15:31.663 --> 15:33.732
The illustrations are
never clear enough.

15:33.765 --> 15:37.136
I mean-- Oh, damn.
We're running out of time.

15:37.169 --> 15:40.639
We really haven't got
anything useful and--

15:50.950 --> 15:52.985
Do you sense any of the power
that Buffy spoke about?

15:55.187 --> 15:58.725
I gotta say no.
It must be a Slayer thing.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.264
Tapping into magics
might help with that.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.466
Maybe.
But, I mean,

16:07.500 --> 16:11.004
if Caleb is-is scared
of this thing,

16:11.038 --> 16:15.008
it must be pretty dangerous,
and tapping into that--

16:18.245 --> 16:21.280
Willow, you could--
you could do it without
endangering yourself.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.017
If I-I tried something big,
I'd change,

16:24.051 --> 16:26.186
and then it's all
black hair

16:26.219 --> 16:30.956
and-and veins
and lightning bolts.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.860
I can hardly do
a locator spell
without getting dark roots.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.528
And if it was necessary?

16:36.562 --> 16:39.331
Honestly, I don't know.

16:46.373 --> 16:50.342
All right.
Do what you can.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.312
That's all
any of us can do.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.514
I guess so.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.551
Man, none of these sound right.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.488
I mean, look.
Here's one that's just
"M" question mark.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.191
-What the heck is that?
-Let me see.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.761
It's not a question mark.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.098
It's the international
phonetics alphabet symbol
for glottal stop.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.902
-A "whoie"?
-A sort of gulping noise.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.538
I'm-I'm remembering
something here.

17:18.569 --> 17:23.276
Um--
Uh, hieroglyphs.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.679
Hieroglyphs stand for
sets of consonants as you know.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.515
Yes. Absolutely.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.785
Now, "M" plus glottal stop
is represented by a picture

17:32.818 --> 17:34.520
that's commonly thought

17:34.554 --> 17:37.856
to symbolize
a sickle or a scythe.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.459
It's in thousands of carvings--

17:39.491 --> 17:42.060
Egypt, throughout
the ancient world.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.263
Carvings like you'd have
on a pagan temple?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.468
Go back.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.069
See what else we can find out
about this temple.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.243
The scythe is a symbol of death.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.579
-Let's see where these pagans
buried their dead.
-DAWN: Xander!

18:00.613 --> 18:02.981
my crossbow
is not out here.

18:03.015 --> 18:07.386
I told you.
I don't leave crossbows around
all willy-nilly.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.457
Not since that time
with Miss Kitty Fantastico.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.460
Hey, did you know
I have to take a driving test
every year now?

18:13.492 --> 18:16.128
-Because you're old?
-No, because of my eye.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.330
It's a whole state law.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.500
They don't trust
my depth perception anymore.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.835
That sucks.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.003
And you know what's even worse?

18:25.037 --> 18:29.241
All the stupid
"It's all fun and games until
someone loses an eye" jokes.

18:29.276 --> 18:33.313
"Hey, Xander, so, uh,
no more fun and games, huh?"

18:33.346 --> 18:37.083
-Giles was just
having fun with you.
-That's not the point.

18:37.115 --> 18:40.853
It's an obvious joke.
It'd be like someone
calling me a Cyclops.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.122
Oh.
(laughs)

18:46.992 --> 18:48.961
Oh.
(clears throat)

18:48.994 --> 18:51.263
Okay, so not that funny.

18:51.298 --> 18:54.933
I mean, uh, give me some
"Eye of the beholder" jokes,
you know?

18:54.967 --> 18:58.104
Or, uh-- Or some
"Eye for an eye" jokes.

18:58.136 --> 19:02.275
Or maybe even a postmodern
"I, Claudius" joke, you know?

19:02.308 --> 19:05.144
-It's about standards, Dawnie.
-I know.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.949
Hey, just, uh, be creative.

19:09.981 --> 19:12.984
Look, everyone's still
kind of on guard around you.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.688
But before you know it--
(muffled scream)

19:35.842 --> 19:37.910
(grunting)

19:39.912 --> 19:42.315
Not that I care personally,
but you are wasting

19:42.348 --> 19:45.218
a lot of robust,
full-bodied merlot.

19:45.251 --> 19:48.054
Why did you let her go?
You know I could
take her in a fight.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.189
We'll get her.
Calm down.

19:50.222 --> 19:54.026
I'm calm!
You should see me
when I get angry.

19:54.059 --> 19:58.163
She's powerful right now,
and you're weak.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.000
You know, all of a sudden,
I'm gettin' less calm.

20:01.032 --> 20:04.537
Face it.
Your strength is waning.

20:04.570 --> 20:08.907
It has been quite some time
since we've... merged.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.012
Maybe you're right.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.781
Okay, let's do it.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.053
Boy, you sure know how
to romance a girl.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.890
No flowers, no dinner,
no tour of the rectory.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.858
Just, "Okay, I'm ready.
Let's do it!"

20:26.893 --> 20:30.396
-Help me.
My knees are weak.
-Watch what you say now.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.765
You're startin' to sound
like her. This is
a sacred experience for me.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.567
And for me as well.

20:35.602 --> 20:40.072
Look, when this is all over
and our armies spring forth

20:40.105 --> 20:44.143
and our will
sweeps the world,
I will be able to enter

20:44.175 --> 20:49.382
every man, woman,
and child on this Earth
just as I enter you.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.984
-Are you tryin'
to make me jealous?
-I'm trying to make you a god.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.261
I am thy humble servant.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.979
(deep voice)
And I am ready to serve thee.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.185
BUFFY:
You feel it too, don't you?

21:27.219 --> 21:29.154
Damn.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.660
And, damn,
that's somethin'.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.229
I know. It's old.

21:38.897 --> 21:43.001
It's strong,
and it feels like--
like it's mine.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.876
I guess that means it's yours.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.948
It belongs to the Slayer.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.984
The Slayer in charge,
which I'm guessing is you.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.422
I honestly don't know.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.826
-Does it matter?
-It never mattered to me.

22:06.858 --> 22:10.896
Somebody has to lead.
Let's vote for Chao-Ahn.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.700
It's harder to lead people
into a deathtrap
if you don't speak English.

22:13.732 --> 22:15.367
It wasn't your fault.

22:16.935 --> 22:19.005
I'm really not lookin'
for forgiveness.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.074
-You're not?
-What do you want me to say?

22:22.107 --> 22:23.976
-I blew it.
-You didn't blow it.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.011
-Tell that to--
-People die.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.980
You lead them into battle,
they're gonna die.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.518
It doesn't matter
how ready you are
or how smart you are.

22:31.550 --> 22:35.755
War is about death.
Needless, stupid death.

22:37.457 --> 22:41.427
So... here's the laugh riot.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.931
My whole life,
I've been a loner.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.333
-That's the funny part?
Did I miss something?
-I'm tryin' to--

22:47.365 --> 22:49.769
Sorry. Sorry.
Go.

22:49.801 --> 22:52.337
No ties.
No buddies.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.575
No relationships
that lasted longer than--

22:55.607 --> 22:59.778
Well, Robin lasted
pretty long.
Boy's got stamina.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.750
Principal Wood and you?
And in my--

23:03.782 --> 23:06.117
-Don't tell me you two
got wriggly?
-No! No. No, no.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.421
We're just good friends.

23:08.454 --> 23:13.593
Or mortal enemies,
depending on which day of the--
Was that the funny part?

23:13.625 --> 23:16.261
Okay, the point.

23:16.295 --> 23:19.097
Me by myself all the time,

23:19.131 --> 23:21.200
and lookin' at you,
everything you have,

23:21.232 --> 23:24.236
and, I don't know,
jealous.

23:24.269 --> 23:27.807
And then there I am.
Everybody's lookin' to me,

23:27.839 --> 23:32.644
trustin' me to lead them,
and I've never felt
so alone in my entire life.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.346
Yeah.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.152
And that's you every day,
isn't it?

23:44.123 --> 23:46.125
I love my friends.

23:46.157 --> 23:49.761
I'm very grateful for them.

23:49.796 --> 23:54.165
But that's the price
of being a Slayer.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.470
There's only supposed to be one.

23:57.503 --> 24:00.105
Maybe that's why you and I
can never get along.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.273
We're not supposed
to exist together.

24:02.307 --> 24:06.345
-Also, you went evil
and were killing people.
-Good point. Also a factor.

24:08.346 --> 24:09.882
But you're right.

24:11.851 --> 24:16.756
I mean, I--
I guess everyone's alone.

24:16.788 --> 24:21.661
But being a Slayer,
there's a burden we can't share.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.829
And no one else can feel it.

24:25.865 --> 24:30.036
-Thank God we're hot chicks
with superpowers.
-Takes the edge off.

24:30.068 --> 24:32.070
-Comforting.
-Mm-hmm.

24:37.676 --> 24:40.011
Honey, you're home.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.147
-Yeah.
-(sighs)

24:42.181 --> 24:45.551
And you did it.
Fulfilled your mission.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.355
Found the Holy Grail
or the Holy Hand Grenade,
or whatever the hell that is.

24:49.387 --> 24:52.692
Right now,
we're going with scythe.
You like?

24:52.724 --> 24:55.060
Well, pointy and wooden
is not exactly the look
I want to know better,

24:55.094 --> 24:57.630
but it does have flair.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.067
I can see why a girl would
ditch a fella for one of these.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.770
I'm sorry about that.

25:07.205 --> 25:10.241
It doesn't matter.
You're back in the bosom.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.411
All's forgiven.

25:12.443 --> 25:15.213
And, uh, last night

25:15.247 --> 25:17.549
was just a glitch.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.518
A bit of cold comfort
from the cellar dweller.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.854
Just don't make
a thing out of it.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.394
-Great.
I have work to do.
-Oh, yeah.

25:28.426 --> 25:31.564
-Another solo mission,
of course?
-Yeah, it is.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.000
That's fine.
You don't have to get
shirty about it.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.236
I'm not "shirty."
And what is "shirty"?
That's not even a word.

25:37.269 --> 25:40.673
All right. All right.
Big secret mission.
It's fine.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.375
It's not a secret.
Well, I mean, it is,

25:43.409 --> 25:45.010
but that's the point
of the mission--

25:45.044 --> 25:46.746
find out the secret.

25:46.778 --> 25:50.548
This thing was forged by--
We don't even know.

25:50.583 --> 25:54.586
I mean, something about a tomb
on unconsecrated ground.

25:54.621 --> 25:59.759
That's what I have to do.
I need to find out what this is
and why I have it.

25:59.791 --> 26:04.596
And that's the thing
the preacher man was so anxious
to keep out of your mitts?

26:04.631 --> 26:07.866
-That it is.
-Well, maybe I'll swing by
the vineyard when you go,

26:07.900 --> 26:09.300
make sure
he's sittin' tight.

26:11.269 --> 26:14.105
-Great.
-Okay.

26:19.979 --> 26:23.115
-You're a dope.
-I'm a what?

26:23.148 --> 26:26.051
You're a dope and a bonehead,
and you're shirty.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.153
Have you gone
completely Carrot Top?

26:28.186 --> 26:32.090
Do you see this?
This may actually
help me fight my war.

26:32.124 --> 26:34.226
This might be
the key to everything.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.762
And the reason I'm holding it
is because of you.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.465
Because of the strength
that you gave me last night.

26:40.499 --> 26:45.104
I am tired of defensiveness
and-and weird mixed signals.
I have Faith for that.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.740
Let's just get
to the truth here, okay?

26:47.773 --> 26:49.776
I don't know how you felt
about last night,
but I will not--

26:49.808 --> 26:51.711
Terrified.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.648
Of what?

26:59.550 --> 27:02.221
Last night was--

27:07.459 --> 27:09.327
God, I'm such a jerk.
I can't do this.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.330
Spike?

27:14.365 --> 27:17.236
It was the best night
of my life.

27:21.539 --> 27:25.477
If you poke fun at me,
you bloody well better use that,
'cause I couldn't bear it.

27:25.510 --> 27:27.645
It may not mean
that much to you, but--

27:27.680 --> 27:30.717
-I just told you it did.
-(sighs)

27:30.750 --> 27:34.519
Yeah.
I hear you say it, but--

27:37.556 --> 27:41.460
I've lived
for soddin' ever, Buffy.
I've done everything.

27:41.492 --> 27:44.896
I've done things with you
I can't spell, but...

27:44.931 --> 27:46.865
I've never...

27:48.500 --> 27:50.368
been close...

27:51.603 --> 27:54.673
to anyone,
least of all you...

27:58.711 --> 28:00.578
until last night.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.650
All I did was...

28:04.682 --> 28:08.721
hold you, watch you sleep,

28:08.755 --> 28:10.923
and it was the best night
of my life.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.227
So, yeah,

28:15.260 --> 28:17.997
I'm...

28:18.029 --> 28:20.499
terrified.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.969
You don't have to be.

28:26.772 --> 28:28.673
Were you there with me?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.809
I was.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.381
What does that mean?

28:37.916 --> 28:41.788
I don't know.
Does it have to mean something?

28:41.820 --> 28:43.654
No.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.925
Not right now.

28:46.959 --> 28:50.930
-Maybe when--
-No, let's just leave it.

28:52.663 --> 28:54.700
Okay.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.602
We'll go be heroes.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.978
Ooh, this one
has oxygen tanks.

29:06.011 --> 29:08.446
They'd only be useful
if something big was attacking.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.648
And then we could shove one
down their throat
and blow 'em up

29:10.682 --> 29:13.419
like Roy Scheider did
with that shark in Jaws.

29:13.451 --> 29:17.756
-What?
-You are the perfect woman.

29:17.789 --> 29:21.292
I've often thought so.
Wanna rob?

29:21.326 --> 29:22.661
Let's rob.

29:26.031 --> 29:29.935
Ooh, cool.
Gauze and alcohol,

29:29.969 --> 29:34.105
tape, and sutures
if we want to get
stitchy with it.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.775
Oh, and there's a box
of ointment here.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.778
-I used one of these
on a rash once.
-Oh. Show me.

29:39.811 --> 29:43.915
Well, it's healed up,
but it was red and crusty
with these little itchy places.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.285
Show me
the box full of ointments,
you little freak.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.653
And get cotton packing
for the big wounds.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.794
It's gonna be bad, isn't it?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.164
Yeah.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.436
So how come you're here?
I mean, you could just go,
right?

30:05.471 --> 30:08.106
Yeah.
I did once before.

30:08.140 --> 30:12.878
-Before what?
-Well, there was this other
apocalypse this one time.

30:12.912 --> 30:16.949
And, well, I took off.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.184
But this time, I don't--
I don't know.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.520
Well, what's different?

30:22.554 --> 30:26.491
Well, I guess I was kind of new
to being around humans before.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.795
But now, I've seen a lot more,
gotten to know people,

30:29.827 --> 30:31.963
seen what they're
capable of,

30:31.998 --> 30:34.700
and...

30:34.732 --> 30:40.172
I guess I just realized
how amazingly screwed up
they all are.

30:40.205 --> 30:43.709
I mean, really,
really screwed up
in a monumental fashion.

30:45.243 --> 30:48.346
-Oh.
-And they have no purpose
that unites them,

30:48.380 --> 30:52.050
so they just drift around
blundering through life
until they die,

30:52.084 --> 30:53.885
which they know is coming,

30:53.920 --> 30:57.088
yet every single one
of them is surprised
when it happens to them.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.392
They're incapable of thinking
about what they want
beyond the moment.

31:00.425 --> 31:03.295
They kill each other,
which is clearly insane.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.967
And yet, here's the thing.

31:09.367 --> 31:13.404
When it's something
that really matters,
they fight.

31:13.439 --> 31:16.375
I mean, they're
lame morons for fighting,

31:16.407 --> 31:18.844
but they do.

31:18.876 --> 31:20.546
They never--

31:22.480 --> 31:23.781
They never quit.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.690
And so I guess
I will keep fighting too.

31:31.722 --> 31:34.160
(sighs)
That was kind of beautiful.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.431
-You-- You love humans.
-I do not!

31:39.464 --> 31:43.201
Yes, you do. You love them.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.270
Stop it!
I don't love them!

31:45.304 --> 31:47.538
And I'll kill you
if you tell anybody!

31:47.573 --> 31:49.942
I won't tell anybody.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.044
I won't get a chance to anyway.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.912
I don't know.
You might survive.

31:53.945 --> 31:57.715
No, y might survive.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.252
You know how to handle a weapon,
and you've been in this world
for, like, a thousand years.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.990
I'm not so--
(sighs)

32:04.022 --> 32:05.824
I don't think I'll be okay.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.194
I'm cool with it.

32:10.997 --> 32:15.500
I think I'd like to finish out
as one of those lame humans

32:15.534 --> 32:17.036
trying to do what's right.

32:19.637 --> 32:20.972
Yeah.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.810
So, wheelchair fight?

32:25.844 --> 32:28.180
(both shouting)

32:28.213 --> 32:29.315
Ow!

32:30.516 --> 32:32.718
-(yells)
-Ow!

33:35.346 --> 33:38.549
WOMAN:
I'd forgotten.

33:38.584 --> 33:43.989
I'd forgotten how young
you would be.

33:44.021 --> 33:47.726
It comes from the waiting.
The mind plays tricks.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.962
I see you've found our weapon.

33:53.464 --> 33:57.536
-Who are you?
-One of many.

33:57.568 --> 34:00.538
Well, time was.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.874
Now, I'm alone
in the world.

34:02.907 --> 34:05.576
So what are you,
some kind of ghost?

34:06.978 --> 34:10.748
Nope.
I'm as real as you are.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.552
Just-- Well,

34:13.585 --> 34:15.786
let me put it this way.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.623
I look good for my age.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.958
I've been waiting.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.969
You pulled it
out of the rock.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.639
I was one of those
who put it in there.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.976
-What is it?
-A weapon.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.313
A scythe,

34:41.347 --> 34:45.550
forged in secrecy
for one like you who--

34:45.583 --> 34:49.288
I'm sorry.
What's your name?

34:49.320 --> 34:52.422
-Buffy.
-No, really.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.965
We forged it in secrecy...

34:59.998 --> 35:03.268
-and kept it hidden
from the Shadow Men, who--
-Yeah, met those guys.

35:03.302 --> 35:05.436
Didn't really care
too much for 'em.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.606
Ah, yes. Then you know.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.641
And they became
the Watchers.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.644
And the Watchers
watched the Slayers,

35:13.679 --> 35:15.947
but we were watching them.

35:15.981 --> 35:20.851
Oh, so you're, like--
What are you?

35:20.885 --> 35:23.021
Guardians.

35:23.054 --> 35:26.257
Women who want
to help and protect you.

35:26.291 --> 35:31.329
We forged this centuries ago,
halfway around the world.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.664
Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.

35:33.699 --> 35:38.603
Forged there, it was
put to use right here...

35:38.637 --> 35:42.840
to kill the last pure demon
that walked upon the Earth.

35:42.873 --> 35:46.110
The rest were already
driven under.

35:46.143 --> 35:49.315
And then there were men here,
and then there were monks,

35:49.347 --> 35:53.452
and then there was a town,
and now there was you.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.487
And the scythe remained hidden.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.389
I don't understand.

35:58.423 --> 36:01.025
How is it possible that
we didn't know any of this?

36:01.059 --> 36:03.362
We hid too.

36:03.394 --> 36:06.130
We had to, until now.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.400
We're the last surprise.

36:08.434 --> 36:11.637
Does this mean I can win?

36:11.670 --> 36:14.505
That is really
up to you.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.744
This is a powerful weapon.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.315
Yeah.

36:23.349 --> 36:26.684
But you already
have weapons.

36:26.717 --> 36:29.221
Oh.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.389
Use it wisely,

36:31.422 --> 36:33.992
and perhaps you can
beat back the rising dark.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.594
One way or another,

36:36.628 --> 36:38.597
it can only mean

36:38.630 --> 36:41.199
an end is truly near.

36:44.302 --> 36:47.273
I'm sorry. I didn't catch
that last part on account
of her neck snappin' and all.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.476
Did she say the end
is near or here?

37:05.623 --> 37:07.592
XANDER:
Hey, Dawn?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.394
Dawn, you awake?

37:12.130 --> 37:13.465
What happened?

37:15.132 --> 37:18.637
Um, I thought
you might say that.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.972
Actually, I meant to say,
"What the hell happened?"

37:22.007 --> 37:24.074
It was chloroform.

37:24.108 --> 37:26.978
"Colorforms--" What?

37:27.012 --> 37:31.248
Chloroform.
Are you still loopy?

37:31.282 --> 37:34.286
Mmm. Sorry about that.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.954
Someone knocked me out
with chloroform.

37:40.358 --> 37:44.429
Xander, where are we going?
What's going on?

37:44.463 --> 37:46.931
-Talk to me.
-Away.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.936
-What's this?
-Just open it.

37:58.677 --> 38:01.112
BUFFY'S VOICE:
"Dearest Dawn,
Don't be angry with Xander.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.114
"He only did
what I told him to do.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.815
"This isn't the place
for either of you.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.786
"Please know that I love you
and that everything I do
is for you.

38:07.818 --> 38:10.188
"I promised once to show you
this beautiful world,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.858
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to make that happen."

38:12.891 --> 38:14.525
(tires screeching)

38:54.365 --> 38:56.467
(chuckling)

38:56.501 --> 38:58.403
You're not slippin' out
of this fight, girl.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.907
Can't you see?
You can't stop me.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.510
I can just
keep goin' back for more.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.344
It's like bein' reborn.

39:51.757 --> 39:55.494
Now, I gave you ample warning.
I told you not to interfere.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.929
But you chose not to heed.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.483
I was kind of hoping
it would go this way.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.585
Hey!

40:29.360 --> 40:31.730
I was never much
for preachers.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.764
Angel.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.702
-You look good.
-You look timely.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.806
-And also good.
-Heard maybe
you needed a hand.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.179
Ah, it's one of those things
you have to finish yourself.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.481
Really kinda is.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.293
You are so gonna lose.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.378
God, I miss watching this.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.192
(laughing)

41:47.606 --> 41:49.407
See? Under control.

41:49.440 --> 41:55.213
Well, at least you could tell me
you're glad to see me.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.882
(weapon clatters)

42:06.423 --> 42:07.793
That bitch.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.793
Grr! Arrgh!
