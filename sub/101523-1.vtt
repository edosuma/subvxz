WEBVTT

00:43.360 --> 00:44.529
Oh, God.

00:46.096 --> 00:47.030
Wow.

00:49.501 --> 00:51.201
That's a nice bathing suit.

00:51.836 --> 00:53.103
Amazing.

00:54.104 --> 00:55.172
Oh, God.

00:58.108 --> 00:59.243
Beautiful.

00:59.276 --> 01:01.513
Dude, I am so jealous.

01:01.546 --> 01:02.580
Let me see.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.451
Oh yeah, Ko Samui.

01:06.484 --> 01:09.353
Why did you come back
from Thailand...?

01:09.386 --> 01:10.254
Who's that?

01:10.287 --> 01:11.088
Dylan.

01:11.121 --> 01:12.557
Why did you come back
from Dylan?

01:12.590 --> 01:14.224
I know, right.

01:14.258 --> 01:15.158
Hiiiii.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.695
Hiiiii.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.066
Save yourself.

01:27.237 --> 01:28.540
I love that.

01:28.573 --> 01:29.807
That bird painting.

01:29.841 --> 01:31.241
Yeah, the prison market.

01:31.275 --> 01:32.510
A prisoner painted that.

01:32.544 --> 01:34.411
Birds mean freedom.

01:34.444 --> 01:35.045
Really.

01:35.078 --> 01:37.114
Man, I should paint birds.

01:37.147 --> 01:38.650
Zoe, what am I doing.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.752
I hate nursing,
I can't be a nurse.

01:40.785 --> 01:42.587
I told you that last year.

01:42.620 --> 01:44.489
Everyone on your shift
is going to die.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.723
I would save some.

01:46.423 --> 01:47.559
Like Dylan.

01:47.592 --> 01:48.726
I would save Dylan.

01:51.261 --> 01:53.297
Ugh, God.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.766
It stinks in here.

01:54.799 --> 01:56.734
Yeah, I dunno about this room...

01:56.768 --> 01:58.536
You have a guest!

01:58.570 --> 01:59.269
Hello!

01:59.303 --> 02:01.104
Not now Bubbles,
shut the door.

02:01.138 --> 02:03.407
Darren Danowski,
HIV negative.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.709
She said shut the door.

02:04.742 --> 02:06.209
She seems nice.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.579
Is this where
the roofie party's at?

02:07.612 --> 02:08.580
The what party?!

02:08.613 --> 02:10.848
Hey you guys can roofie me...
just no photos.

02:10.882 --> 02:11.516
See ya, guys.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.417
Okay, I'm okay with photos.

02:14.184 --> 02:15.587
Really nice chat, Zoe.

02:15.620 --> 02:16.688
Okay, we'll see you later,
alright.

02:16.721 --> 02:17.922
Ba-bye!

02:17.956 --> 02:21.224
Umm Zoe, you have a serious
bro problem in this building.

02:21.258 --> 02:22.894
Do they have spray for that,
or traps?

02:22.927 --> 02:23.561
God.

02:23.595 --> 02:24.562
Court and...

02:24.596 --> 02:25.362
Bubbles?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.798
Bubbles-in-the-Tub.

02:26.831 --> 02:28.633
You must know him,
that YouTube guy.

02:28.666 --> 02:30.535
He had the viral video.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.837
He was the baby farting
in the bathtub.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.539
Wow, husband material.

02:35.006 --> 02:36.474
They're the Kappa Pho guys.

02:36.507 --> 02:38.408
They're having that
huge Halloween party.

02:38.442 --> 02:39.376
We should go!

02:39.409 --> 02:40.712
No thanks.

02:40.945 --> 02:41.879
Shit.

02:45.483 --> 02:48.218
A Halloween Party for Grace.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.419
What the fu...

02:49.454 --> 02:51.823
With ghosts and goblins
and vampires.

02:51.856 --> 02:54.291
But what are you
really afraid of?

02:54.324 --> 02:55.760
Hey Zoe, you have a virus!

02:56.494 --> 02:57.762
I've seen that.

02:57.795 --> 02:58.830
It's a Halloween meme.

02:58.863 --> 02:59.764
A what?

02:59.797 --> 03:01.466
You're supposed to write
in your worst fear

03:01.499 --> 03:03.333
before the counter goes out.

03:03.367 --> 03:04.802
Otherwise it comes to life.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.638
How does it know my name?

03:06.671 --> 03:07.572
Technology.

03:08.773 --> 03:09.607
Okay...?

03:11.208 --> 03:12.376
Hey.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.778
How do I get rid of this thing.

03:13.811 --> 03:16.446
Just let the timer run out,
a scary clip comes up.

03:16.481 --> 03:18.549
Well, you said my fear
would come to life!

03:18.583 --> 03:19.817
It's a meme.

03:35.733 --> 03:36.668
Saved.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.670
Okay, that was dramatic.

03:38.703 --> 03:39.771
You know
if you put your fear in

03:39.804 --> 03:40.905
you don't see the video.

03:40.938 --> 03:42.473
Well, how would it know
my worst fear?

03:42.507 --> 03:43.440
It's a meme.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.809
It knew your name didn't it.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.243
Yeah.

03:46.276 --> 03:47.177
That's true.

03:49.413 --> 03:50.815
That's pretty good hacking.

03:50.848 --> 03:52.684
What's the clip?

03:52.717 --> 03:54.284
Uh, it's a witch.

03:54.317 --> 03:54.819
It's bad.

03:54.852 --> 03:56.219
I hate horror stuff.

03:56.253 --> 03:57.922
You know spiders
don't go up there.

03:57.955 --> 03:58.656
You don't know that.

03:58.690 --> 03:59.557
They could.

03:59.590 --> 04:00.424
It's warm.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.258
And beautiful.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.860
It's a dumb phobia.

04:02.894 --> 04:03.961
Alright,
what's your worst fear.

04:03.995 --> 04:04.796
Nothing.

04:04.829 --> 04:05.997
I'm a Lady Chuck Norris.

04:06.030 --> 04:07.397
You're fucking scared
of everything...

04:07.431 --> 04:08.298
- Lies...
- Tell me.

04:08.599 --> 04:09.266
No.

04:09.299 --> 04:10.635
Ooo, you're hiding something.

04:10.668 --> 04:11.435
Tell me.

04:11.469 --> 04:12.570
Fucking tell me.

04:12.603 --> 04:13.370
Fine.

04:14.271 --> 04:14.972
It's pigs.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.442
- What.
- Yeah, oink oink.

04:18.476 --> 04:19.443
Those things.

04:19.477 --> 04:21.411
Oh my God, that's so stupid.

04:21.445 --> 04:23.648
Every Halloween
my brother gets a pig mask

04:23.681 --> 04:26.316
and chases me...
worst fucking nightmare.

04:26.349 --> 04:26.851
Dude.

04:26.884 --> 04:28.486
Pigs are not scary.

04:29.053 --> 04:31.689
At least spiders are like,
you know, evil.

04:31.723 --> 04:32.957
Pigs are...

04:32.990 --> 04:34.459
Dude, they're pink.

04:35.292 --> 04:35.893
Here.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.562
I got it one Christmas.

04:38.496 --> 04:39.497
Farmer Dell?

04:39.530 --> 04:41.799
Still fucking freaks me out.

04:41.833 --> 04:45.770
They're people-ish,
they wear clothes, they talk.

04:45.803 --> 04:47.739
But they're still pigs.

04:47.772 --> 04:49.807
Hooves and tails.

04:49.841 --> 04:51.843
And those little black eyes.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.376
Unblinking.

04:53.410 --> 04:54.512
Mindless.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.680
Creepy.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.682
And now you have a pig phobia.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.316
No, I got that after.

04:59.349 --> 05:00.250
After what?

05:02.620 --> 05:03.688
What.

05:03.721 --> 05:04.922
I'll tell you but.

05:05.623 --> 05:06.991
It's fucked.

05:07.024 --> 05:08.793
You know my spider story,
you have to tell me.

05:09.827 --> 05:11.294
Okay so, growing up,

05:11.328 --> 05:13.363
there was this farm
down the road.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.901
And there was this mean
old drunk farmer, Mr. Hannaman.

05:16.934 --> 05:17.869
And for whatever reason,

05:17.902 --> 05:20.538
Hannaman didn't always feed
his animals.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.874
And if pigs don't eat,
they go crazy,

05:22.907 --> 05:24.441
they'll eat anything.

05:25.275 --> 05:28.311
So one night,
Hannaman, drunk as a monkey,

05:28.345 --> 05:31.448
sitting on the barn fence,
screaming at his animals...

05:31.482 --> 05:32.617
Falls in and the pigs eat him.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.586
They eat everything.

05:36.654 --> 05:39.056
They opened the largest
and found the farmer's teeth.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.625
Even his leather boots.

05:40.658 --> 05:41.893
Eww.

05:41.926 --> 05:43.561
Okay, so now you're scared
of pigs.

05:43.594 --> 05:44.629
No. Wait.

05:44.662 --> 05:46.998
So a couple days later
dad goes down to the farm.

05:47.899 --> 05:49.432
The pigs are gone.

05:50.101 --> 05:50.802
What?

05:50.835 --> 05:51.502
Where?

05:51.536 --> 05:52.637
No one knew.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.805
The fence was fine.

05:53.838 --> 05:55.106
Gate was locked.

05:55.139 --> 05:56.674
But I can tell you this.

05:57.642 --> 05:59.510
The woods behind our house.

05:59.544 --> 06:01.012
Something was in there.

06:01.045 --> 06:02.013
Pigs?

06:02.046 --> 06:02.947
Something.

06:04.682 --> 06:08.052
You could hear noises,
but they weren't animal sounds.

06:09.987 --> 06:11.055
And then.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.023
I saw it.

06:13.390 --> 06:14.559
Behind our shed.

06:14.592 --> 06:15.493
In the trees.

06:15.526 --> 06:16.460
Standing.

06:17.562 --> 06:20.531
Those little black eyes.

06:20.565 --> 06:21.465
Unblinking.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.068
Mindless.

06:24.101 --> 06:25.036
No way.

06:26.403 --> 06:28.405
And that's when it said
something to me.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.372
What?

06:31.876 --> 06:34.411
What?!

06:34.444 --> 06:35.179
What?!

06:35.213 --> 06:35.980
Fuck!

06:36.013 --> 06:36.814
Fuck!

06:36.848 --> 06:38.381
You are a fucker!

06:38.415 --> 06:38.983
Oh my God.

06:40.017 --> 06:41.886
Shit, it's late.

06:41.919 --> 06:43.454
Ugh, phone, where's my phone.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.622
It's getting dark out
so no wonder

06:44.655 --> 06:45.723
I believed your bullshit.

06:45.756 --> 06:46.991
It's actually true.

06:47.024 --> 06:48.759
Sure it is.

06:48.793 --> 06:51.629
No I'm being serious,
I saw something behind my house.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.830
- Pig people?
- Hey look.

06:53.764 --> 06:54.899
I got one too.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.903
How does it know our names?

06:58.936 --> 06:59.937
What should I put.

06:59.971 --> 07:00.671
I don't know.

07:00.705 --> 07:02.607
Small dicks.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.942
It should be that.

07:04.976 --> 07:07.078
As if you discriminate.

07:07.111 --> 07:08.579
Put in Pig People.

07:09.881 --> 07:10.648
Wait.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.116
Don't you want to see
the witch?

07:12.149 --> 07:12.850
Oh.

07:12.884 --> 07:13.818
Yeah, okay.

07:16.921 --> 07:18.055
Oh.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.557
This is...
Alright.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.092
Zoe, your worst fear
is coming for you.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.094
Yeah there's nothing scary
about this.

07:23.127 --> 07:24.161
- We gotta go.
- Alright, alright, I'm coming.

07:24.195 --> 07:25.096
Thanks.

07:26.564 --> 07:27.865
Oh, no.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.604
- Yo, what's up.
- Yeah, where you guys going?

07:33.638 --> 07:35.773
Come on let's break down
some college barriers.

07:35.806 --> 07:37.508
Turn down the bro dial, okay.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.776
Can you turn mine down for me?

07:38.809 --> 07:41.145
Saw your dial on YouTube,
no thanks.

07:45.016 --> 07:46.217
I was 2 years old!

07:46.250 --> 07:47.618
And I was in a tub!

07:47.652 --> 07:48.753
It's from the yoga studio.

07:48.786 --> 07:50.221
- Like the lobby area.
- Yes.

07:50.254 --> 07:51.656
- Why would she take your shoes?
- I know.

07:51.689 --> 07:52.924
- There's Vicki.
- I gotta go.

07:52.957 --> 07:54.458
- Thanks for the ride, honey.
- Okay, byeeee!

07:54.492 --> 07:55.793
Okay.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.695
Sorry, sorry, sorry, let's go.

07:58.696 --> 07:59.597
Let's kill this.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.748
...decides he's going to try
and do a back flip,

08:17.782 --> 08:18.816
from the poles.

08:18.849 --> 08:19.750
Oh, you're kidding.

08:19.784 --> 08:21.953
How'd that end.

08:21.986 --> 08:23.120
- Not well.
- Oof.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.056
So, Buddy does his back flip.

08:25.089 --> 08:26.724
Lands on his head.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.660
But he's so drunk, he gets up
like it never happened.

08:29.694 --> 08:31.228
Oh my God.

08:31.262 --> 08:34.665
So, I don't know how you do it,
but I normally go in sections.

08:34.699 --> 08:38.269
Start in dresses and then work
your way that way.

08:38.302 --> 08:41.038
Sounds good,
I'm a counting tornado.

08:41.072 --> 08:42.807
Don't know if you'll
be saying that at 2 A.M.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.041
Peeing!

11:33.944 --> 11:35.079
Vicki?

12:05.342 --> 12:06.977
Oh my God!

12:15.319 --> 12:16.954
What the fuck?!

12:43.481 --> 12:45.182
Help!

14:52.677 --> 14:54.144
For fuck sake.

14:56.413 --> 14:57.582
What.

15:01.553 --> 15:02.520
What?!

15:18.670 --> 15:20.070
Ma'am?

15:21.138 --> 15:23.140
Are you okay?

15:23.173 --> 15:24.509
Why don't you come with me.

15:31.616 --> 15:32.883
I'm not sure.

15:35.052 --> 15:36.987
- Do you want this?
- It's like a snout.

15:39.724 --> 15:42.426
What did you just say?

15:42.460 --> 15:44.995
What did you say?

15:45.028 --> 15:47.131
Did you just say "snout"?

15:47.164 --> 15:48.132
Let me see that.

15:48.165 --> 15:49.166
It's a crime scene
photo, Gracie.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.134
I want to see it.

16:42.186 --> 16:43.488
Grace, you coming?

16:43.521 --> 16:45.322
I don't feel well.

16:45.355 --> 16:47.057
They're gonna record these soon.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.626
Sounds good.

16:48.660 --> 16:50.528
You're going to get kicked out,
and they're not going to let...

16:50.562 --> 16:53.698
Hey Charlotte,
I got a mom, okay?

16:53.731 --> 16:55.332
Char!

16:55.365 --> 16:56.501
Char!

17:00.037 --> 17:01.071
I'm sorry.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.440
Can you tell Davies
that I'll be there tomorrow.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.703
Um, Spencer?

18:41.138 --> 18:42.205
Hey, Special!

18:50.615 --> 18:51.683
Guys!

18:51.716 --> 18:53.183
Oh my God, look!

18:53.216 --> 18:56.320
It's... it's... it's a girl!

18:56.353 --> 18:57.822
Oooo, a girl!

18:57.855 --> 18:59.156
A live one!

18:59.189 --> 19:00.058
Why aren't you pixelated?

19:00.090 --> 19:02.192
Please accept
my beautiful virginity.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.226
Can I smell your hair?

19:03.260 --> 19:05.195
Can I put your hair
in my mouth?

19:09.299 --> 19:11.301
You read my texts.

19:11.335 --> 19:12.670
Okay, you are good.

19:12.704 --> 19:15.640
Either he's good,
or you need to update your iOS system.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.374
Never text on the campus wi-fi.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.643
I don't...

19:18.676 --> 19:20.545
They're just saying
you need to update your phone.

19:20.578 --> 19:22.412
Sorry, my friend didn't mean
to be a jerk, she...

19:22.446 --> 19:23.848
I don't know if I can help you.

19:23.881 --> 19:25.248
What are you looking
for exactly?

19:25.282 --> 19:26.450
Can we sit somewhere?

19:30.822 --> 19:32.557
So she didn't type Pig People.

19:32.590 --> 19:33.658
She let the counter run out.

19:33.691 --> 19:35.225
And then you said a witch?

19:35.258 --> 19:36.326
Yeah, and something like

19:36.360 --> 19:37.929
"your worst fear
is coming for you".

19:37.962 --> 19:39.464
- Who tweeted this?
- The name's on there...

19:39.497 --> 19:41.264
LaPointe, I think?

19:41.298 --> 19:42.834
I talked to him on the phone,
he's a real reporter.

19:42.867 --> 19:46.403
- It's definitely a pig.
- Yeah.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.271
I called the police about this,
twice.

19:48.305 --> 19:49.874
And both times
they listen politely

19:49.907 --> 19:52.543
and then someone from
Victim Services calls me back

19:52.577 --> 19:54.411
and asks if I need to talk
to someone.

19:54.444 --> 19:59.182
So clearly,
I am crazy conspiracy girl...

19:59.216 --> 20:00.952
You know how she died, right?

20:00.985 --> 20:02.687
- Yeah, I heard...
- Mauled.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.955
Partially consumed.

20:03.988 --> 20:06.791
Obviously, it's just some guy
who knew about Zoe's pig phobia.

20:06.824 --> 20:07.959
But... mauled?

20:07.992 --> 20:10.495
I mean, sounds like an animal.

20:10.528 --> 20:13.296
It's a pretty fucked up
coincidence.

20:13.330 --> 20:14.899
Yeah, I'd say so.

20:14.932 --> 20:17.468
So have you ever heard
of this 'virus' or whatever?

20:17.502 --> 20:19.871
Yeah, last year,
at the Shit-the-Bed-Party

20:19.904 --> 20:21.773
I think someone was talking
about it.

20:21.806 --> 20:22.573
Yeah, I was at that.

20:22.607 --> 20:24.374
Greyson House,
that's Zoe's dorm.

20:24.408 --> 20:25.275
Yeah.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.978
I dunno, this shit's
just pretty weird.

20:27.011 --> 20:28.311
It's definitely weird.

20:28.345 --> 20:29.681
Let's see what we find.

20:34.351 --> 20:35.820
So how did it know our names?

20:35.853 --> 20:36.688
Scanned your email?

20:36.721 --> 20:38.856
But it was my name
on Zoe's computer.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.357
Keyboard patterns?

20:40.390 --> 20:41.759
I've never used her computer
before.

20:41.793 --> 20:43.795
There's nothing in MemeCulture.

20:43.828 --> 20:46.831
Let's check the boards.

20:46.864 --> 20:48.900
Nothing on T Malware,

20:48.933 --> 20:51.469
"But What Are You Really
Afraid Of"...

20:51.502 --> 20:53.504
- Is this a camera?
- Yeah.

20:53.538 --> 20:55.573
We do the
live feeds for bio-sci.

20:55.606 --> 20:56.774
Those are duck eggs.

20:56.808 --> 20:58.241
Ducking cool man.

20:58.275 --> 20:59.677
Here we go,
missing persons report...

20:59.711 --> 21:01.646
- Missing persons?
- No citations.

21:03.548 --> 21:05.516
- They're not here.
- What's not there?

21:05.550 --> 21:07.885
Oh, Scrute,

21:07.919 --> 21:10.688
they're like myth busters
for the internet.

21:10.722 --> 21:12.289
They have a Google reference
on the meme,

21:12.322 --> 21:14.424
which is pretty recent,
which is huge,

21:14.459 --> 21:16.426
it's related
to a missing persons report.

21:16.461 --> 21:17.995
But there's nothing
on the Google side.

21:18.029 --> 21:19.664
See those semi-colons
in the code?

21:19.697 --> 21:21.431
That means
there was other code there.

21:23.601 --> 21:25.903
- I have no idea...
- It means it's good.

21:25.937 --> 21:26.704
Good?

21:26.738 --> 21:27.572
It's 'clip art'.

21:27.605 --> 21:28.706
It can alter Google.

21:28.740 --> 21:29.474
I couldn't do that.

21:29.507 --> 21:31.943
This whole lab
couldn't do that.

21:31.976 --> 21:34.444
Okay, so what does all
of that mean?

21:36.547 --> 21:37.849
It means shit's weird.

21:43.353 --> 21:45.456
You said
it was on her phone, right?

21:45.490 --> 21:47.692
- Can I see that?
- Police have it.

21:47.725 --> 21:48.993
But it was also on her computer.

21:49.026 --> 21:49.927
That's still there.

21:49.961 --> 21:52.663
- Can I see that?
- Yeah.

21:52.697 --> 21:53.965
- Now?
- Why not.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.735
Okay, let me just get
some stuff.

21:57.769 --> 21:59.003
- Stuff?
- Nerd stuff.

21:59.036 --> 22:01.005
Yeah, get all of the nerd stuff.

22:03.908 --> 22:06.343
Whoa a girl, take a photo!

22:06.376 --> 22:07.779
Yeah, I heard that before.

22:26.597 --> 22:27.632
I'm gonna start this up, okay?

22:27.665 --> 22:28.499
Yeah.

22:39.644 --> 22:41.512
- You alright?
- Yeah.

22:41.546 --> 22:43.114
No, I just haven't been here
since so...

22:43.147 --> 22:44.447
I won't be long.

22:47.985 --> 22:49.386
Find anything yet?

22:49.419 --> 22:50.420
Nope.

22:50.454 --> 22:53.057
But I just started, like, now.

22:53.090 --> 22:54.559
Right.

22:54.592 --> 22:56.093
I'm not that good.

23:14.679 --> 23:16.781
What the...

23:16.814 --> 23:17.849
Fucking Gestapo!

23:17.882 --> 23:19.851
They trashed the closet!

23:19.884 --> 23:21.819
- Who?
- Cops!

23:21.853 --> 23:23.921
Why would they come back?

23:23.955 --> 23:25.456
- Are you sure it was them?
- Better be them.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.423
Someone's been in here.

23:26.457 --> 23:27.424
Could you call them?

23:27.458 --> 23:30.061
No, I can't call them,
they think I'm nuts...

23:30.094 --> 23:30.995
Fuck!

23:31.028 --> 23:33.531
They never re-key dorm rooms.

23:33.564 --> 23:34.932
Check it out.

23:34.966 --> 23:36.067
- Duck camera.
- Yeah.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.668
Look, there's an app,
you just put it on your phone

23:37.702 --> 23:39.503
and then it's motion-activated.

23:39.537 --> 23:40.571
Cool.

23:40.605 --> 23:42.473
Just keep it, it's the lab's,
it's super cheap.

23:42.506 --> 23:43.406
You can put it in here

23:43.440 --> 23:44.942
and then if someone comes in
you'll know.

23:44.976 --> 23:46.010
Thanks, Spencer.

23:46.043 --> 23:48.045
You are full of surprises.

23:48.079 --> 23:49.680
Nerds will
surprise you for sure.

23:49.714 --> 23:52.650
I really like that you identify
as like an '80s nerd.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.585
Are you kidding,
those are my favourite movies.

23:54.619 --> 23:56.020
<i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off,
Breakfast Club...</i>

23:56.053 --> 23:57.121
They're so good!

23:57.154 --> 23:58.789
I think it's 'cause they're
will-they-fuck movies.

23:58.823 --> 24:00.858
But I guess like,
all movies are.

24:00.892 --> 24:02.126
What.

24:02.159 --> 24:03.995
Oh, will-they-fuck movies.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.664
My friend Bob has this theory
that every movie...

24:06.697 --> 24:08.599
Well, pretty much every story...

24:08.633 --> 24:11.636
comes down to that one question:
Will They Fuck.

24:11.669 --> 24:12.637
And it keeps it compelling.

24:12.670 --> 24:13.704
It keeps us wondering
if the main characters

24:13.738 --> 24:15.039
are going to do it or not.

24:19.176 --> 24:20.144
Oh.

24:20.177 --> 24:21.879
Not us.

24:21.913 --> 24:23.681
I didn't mean like that.

24:23.714 --> 24:24.682
- No, of course not.
- Sorry.

24:24.715 --> 24:25.750
I just...

24:25.783 --> 24:26.884
people that are not.

24:26.918 --> 24:28.886
Me, or You, or real.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.554
Good thing
we're not in a movie then,

24:30.588 --> 24:32.089
so we don't have to worry
about that.

24:32.123 --> 24:33.491
Yeah.

24:39.130 --> 24:40.231
Grace?

24:40.264 --> 24:43.034
Oh hey, Bubbles,
it's still kind of...

24:43.067 --> 24:44.902
I just wanted to say
I was really sorry.

24:44.936 --> 24:46.037
Zoe was really great.

24:46.070 --> 24:48.472
I was stoked she was going
to be down here this year.

24:48.506 --> 24:50.041
- Thanks, bud.
- Hey, Special.

24:50.074 --> 24:51.709
Bubbles-in-the-Tub.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.244
- You guys old friends?
- BFFs.

24:53.277 --> 24:54.946
I just wanted to check in and...

24:56.514 --> 24:58.049
That's my name.

24:58.082 --> 24:58.816
- Spencer?
- I see it.

24:58.849 --> 25:01.619
Why is my name
on your computer?

25:01.652 --> 25:03.154
"But what are
you really afraid of"...

25:03.187 --> 25:04.989
- What is this?
- How does it know he's here?

25:05.022 --> 25:05.923
- I don't know, I...
- Okay, let me try this...

25:05.957 --> 25:07.024
Just let me do...

25:07.058 --> 25:08.893
Hey it's my name so,
out of the way Special Needs.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.195
Okay, don't fart around,
just put in your worst fear.

25:11.228 --> 25:12.964
Dancing pumpkins!

25:12.997 --> 25:15.066
I want to make sure we get this.

25:15.099 --> 25:16.701
- What am I afraid of?
- The counter's running out.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.138
- What could be worse.
- You have to be honest.

25:21.172 --> 25:21.939
Stop freaking me out.

25:21.973 --> 25:23.574
The clock's ticking,
20 seconds.

25:23.607 --> 25:24.742
I don't know what I'm scared of.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.243
- Yeah, you do.
- Okay, hurry!

25:28.646 --> 25:29.714
Your worst thing, come on.

25:34.585 --> 25:36.520
Oh, my God.

25:36.554 --> 25:37.521
Amazing.

25:37.555 --> 25:38.522
Why didn't you just put
in your worst fear?

25:38.556 --> 25:39.523
- I did!
- Really.

25:39.557 --> 25:40.224
The Exorcist?

25:40.257 --> 25:42.026
Yeah, that movie fucked me up.

25:42.059 --> 25:43.060
It is really scary.

25:43.094 --> 25:45.062
Yeah,
we named our cat Captain Howdy.

25:45.096 --> 25:46.831
Okay, that's actually amazing.

25:46.864 --> 25:51.268
Thanks for the 1990s, Atari,
spooky, spooky meme.

25:51.302 --> 25:52.303
It is very scary.

25:52.336 --> 25:53.537
See you later, crocodile.

25:53.571 --> 25:55.606
Okay, bye.

25:57.875 --> 26:00.011
- Everything okay, did it work?
- No.

26:00.044 --> 26:01.912
Which is kind of impossible.

26:01.946 --> 26:02.913
I don't know,
I've got to take them back,

26:02.947 --> 26:03.881
see what's going on.

26:03.914 --> 26:05.116
Alright, let me help.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.793
I'm just over here,
so I'll see you...

26:15.826 --> 26:16.961
You don't want a ride?

26:16.994 --> 26:18.162
Well, I'm in the Grotto,
I live right around the corner.

26:18.195 --> 26:19.030
I got my mom's mini-van.

26:19.063 --> 26:20.164
Gracie!

26:20.197 --> 26:21.165
Hey, Court.

26:21.198 --> 26:23.200
I wrote you after Zoe's service.

26:23.234 --> 26:24.935
Yeah, sorry, it's, you know...

26:24.969 --> 26:27.271
If there's anything that
any of us at Kappa Pho can do,

26:27.304 --> 26:28.706
just let us know, okay?

26:28.739 --> 26:29.640
What you are doing
for Halloween?

26:29.673 --> 26:30.941
Uhh, not really sure...

26:30.975 --> 26:32.576
It's the big Kappa House
Halloween party,

26:32.610 --> 26:33.844
- you coming girl?
- Uhhmmm...

26:33.878 --> 26:34.945
It's the biggest
party of the year.

26:34.979 --> 26:35.746
Drinks.

26:35.780 --> 26:36.347
Pumpkins.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.748
Drinks.

26:37.782 --> 26:40.017
- Come early!
- Thanks, I probably will.

26:40.051 --> 26:41.285
Spencer, sup brah?

26:41.318 --> 26:43.254
- Court.
- Looking sexual!

26:43.287 --> 26:45.589
- Cool.
- You come by too okay broheem?

26:45.623 --> 26:46.757
Hey, Gracie.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.292
Ask me who.

26:48.325 --> 26:49.760
Ask me who!

26:49.794 --> 26:50.795
Who?

26:50.828 --> 26:52.763
You, that's who.

26:52.797 --> 26:53.731
You.

26:54.965 --> 26:57.134
- Holy shit.
- Yep.

26:57.168 --> 26:59.036
Uh, you know him?

26:59.070 --> 27:02.006
I do know Court, lucky me.

27:02.039 --> 27:03.641
- Seems into you.
- Can you walk me to my car

27:03.674 --> 27:05.242
because he actually
gives me goosebumps.

27:05.276 --> 27:06.977
- Douchebumps.
- Yeah, exactly.

27:07.011 --> 27:09.814
That whole Bro Posse.

27:09.847 --> 27:12.116
They're magnificent,
Court's magnificent actually.

27:12.149 --> 27:13.384
He's like the alpha-bro.

27:13.417 --> 27:14.919
He reminds me of a Centaur.

27:14.952 --> 27:16.153
I guess.

27:16.187 --> 27:17.655
Are you really going
to their Halloween party?

27:17.688 --> 27:18.689
Are you kidding.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.859
I'd rather be eaten alive
by birds.

27:21.892 --> 27:22.993
I'm totally going.

27:23.027 --> 27:24.762
- Oh, yeah?
- Oooooh, yeah.

27:24.795 --> 27:26.330
Gonna hose myself down
with Axe.

27:26.363 --> 27:27.231
Watch <i>Entourage</i>.

27:27.264 --> 27:29.733
Practice giving
my bro-hemes high fives.

27:29.767 --> 27:30.634
It's gonna be great.

27:30.668 --> 27:31.902
Sounds great.

27:31.936 --> 27:33.737
So you went to school
with those guys, hey?

27:33.771 --> 27:35.940
- Bet that was fun.
- It was super fun.

27:35.973 --> 27:37.641
And they gave you the name
"Special"?

27:37.675 --> 27:40.144
Yeah, Court himself, Grade 7.

27:40.177 --> 27:41.278
It could have been worse.

27:41.312 --> 27:42.113
"Bubbles-in-the-Tub".

27:42.146 --> 27:43.914
Oh we had a kid named
"Fartparty".

27:43.948 --> 27:44.949
Even his mom called him that.

27:44.982 --> 27:46.317
Oh my God.

27:46.350 --> 27:47.852
Thanks for helping me
with all this.

27:47.885 --> 27:50.154
At least now we know it's not,
you know, real.

27:50.187 --> 27:50.988
The Halloween virus?

27:51.021 --> 27:52.690
I know I sound like
a crazy person

27:52.723 --> 27:54.992
but I actually started to think
that it worked.

27:55.025 --> 27:56.327
It didn't work with Bubbles.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.162
He put in his fear
and he still got the witch.

27:58.195 --> 27:59.763
Well, I'm pretty sure
Bubbles' worst fear

27:59.797 --> 28:02.066
isn't <i>The Exorcist</i>.

28:02.099 --> 28:03.100
And how would you know that?

28:03.134 --> 28:04.735
I've known Darren Danowski
since we were five.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.203
I know his worst fear,

28:06.237 --> 28:07.872
it was the whole
neighbourhood's.

28:07.905 --> 28:10.407
The Tall Man.

28:10.441 --> 28:11.709
The Tall Man?

28:11.742 --> 28:12.943
That's what we called him.

28:12.977 --> 28:16.080
When we were little he used
to watch us at the playground.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.848
Oh my God that sounds like
an after school...

28:17.882 --> 28:18.983
Seriously, it happened.

28:19.016 --> 28:20.417
Alright what would he do?

28:20.451 --> 28:21.685
Just watch us.

28:24.088 --> 28:26.690
But this one day...

28:26.724 --> 28:28.926
He started coming towards us
non-stop.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.427
Oh my God.

28:30.462 --> 28:31.563
He came right up.

28:31.596 --> 28:35.065
Right into the sandbox
and grabbed Bubbles screaming.

28:35.099 --> 28:38.035
Took off with him.

28:38.068 --> 28:39.970
And today Bubbles would
probably be on milk cartons

28:40.004 --> 28:42.039
but Toomy's dad drove up
and Tall Man let him go

28:42.072 --> 28:43.841
and ran off.

28:43.874 --> 28:47.244
He didn't come back to school
for months.

28:47.278 --> 28:49.146
Man, you just made me
feel sympathy

28:49.180 --> 28:51.215
for someone
named "Bubbles-in-the-Tub".

28:51.248 --> 28:52.816
I know, right.

28:52.850 --> 28:53.717
I'm gonna look at this stuff

28:53.751 --> 28:55.052
and get back to you right away,
okay.

28:55.085 --> 28:56.720
- Okay, thanks Spencer.
- Yeah.

28:58.789 --> 29:00.024
Okay.

29:00.057 --> 29:01.192
See ya.

29:01.225 --> 29:03.360
...harnesses all
the power out of a galaxy.

29:03.394 --> 29:06.830
Now, think about
how far our civilization

29:06.864 --> 29:10.301
has advanced in only 100 years.

29:10.334 --> 29:13.137
Now, think about planet A,

29:13.170 --> 29:18.476
with an extra 5.5 billion years
of evolution,

29:18.510 --> 29:21.912
think of how much more different
things are for them...

30:11.161 --> 30:13.397
No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:18.570 --> 30:20.237
- Jesus!
- Bubbles?

30:20.271 --> 30:21.839
He's coming.

30:21.872 --> 30:22.940
He's coming.

30:22.973 --> 30:24.108
He's coming.

30:24.141 --> 30:25.109
He's coming.

30:25.142 --> 30:26.110
He's coming!

30:26.143 --> 30:27.044
Who is it?

30:27.077 --> 30:30.548
What's going on Mr. Danowski?

30:30.582 --> 30:31.882
Who do you see?

30:45.095 --> 30:46.830
No! Don't open it!

30:46.864 --> 30:47.998
What on earth is going on!

30:48.032 --> 30:48.432
You can't!

30:48.466 --> 30:49.400
You can't!

30:49.433 --> 30:50.468
You can't!

30:52.504 --> 30:55.272
It's Pardeep!

30:55.306 --> 30:56.940
What did you do Pardeep!?

31:24.569 --> 31:25.537
Perfect.

31:25.570 --> 31:27.104
Would you like chicken
on your chimi-cheese?

31:54.566 --> 31:55.966
Hello?

31:55.999 --> 31:57.167
Hello?

31:57.201 --> 31:58.902
Can I help you?

31:58.936 --> 32:00.003
Hellooo?

32:03.374 --> 32:04.341
What can I help you with?

32:04.375 --> 32:07.645
Sorry, can I get a chimi-cheese
and a coke.

32:07.679 --> 32:08.646
No problem!

32:08.680 --> 32:10.381
Would you like chicken
on your chimi-cheese?

32:10.414 --> 32:11.081
No, thanks.

32:11.115 --> 32:13.618
No problem,
that'll be 8.75.

32:39.009 --> 32:40.377
Fuck sake.

32:44.516 --> 32:45.916
What?

32:49.654 --> 32:50.688
What?!

32:52.557 --> 32:54.291
- It forwards!
- What?

32:54.324 --> 32:55.993
The virus, it forwards itself!

32:56.026 --> 32:58.095
But only
if you get the saved screen.

32:58.128 --> 32:59.564
So it didn't send an email
with Bubbles,

32:59.597 --> 33:00.998
but it would've with you.

33:03.367 --> 33:07.505
- The meme sends an email.
- Yeah, to a random contact.

33:07.539 --> 33:08.238
Dot?

33:08.272 --> 33:10.007
Dorothy, that's Zoe's stepmom.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.109
- She died like 2 years ago.
- Shit.

33:12.142 --> 33:14.077
You wish that Dot
got the virus?

33:14.111 --> 33:16.246
Yeah, we're trying
to capture it.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.348
Is this seriously
why you got me out of bed.

33:18.382 --> 33:20.117
That's just the beginning, look.

33:20.150 --> 33:21.418
<i>The clock's
ticking, 20 seconds!</i>

33:21.453 --> 33:22.620
<i>I don't know
what I'm scared of!</i>

33:22.654 --> 33:24.188
Watch when I hit the contrast.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.291
Rectangles?

33:27.324 --> 33:28.460
It's a rune.

33:28.493 --> 33:30.327
A Rune, like from the druids?

33:30.360 --> 33:31.696
Exactly like from the druids.

33:31.729 --> 33:34.198
The cross is 'man'
and the box is 'obstacle'.

33:34.231 --> 33:36.133
Literally 'those who hide'.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.135
But figuratively,
it's a reference to those

33:38.168 --> 33:40.304
who walk the darker side
or the hidden path or whatever.

33:40.337 --> 33:42.674
It... it means demons.

33:42.707 --> 33:43.675
Demons?

33:43.708 --> 33:44.776
Of course.

33:44.809 --> 33:47.044
Dante uses it in The Inferno
to mark the debauchery

33:47.077 --> 33:49.647
of the Venetian
masquerade balls.

33:49.681 --> 33:52.082
What's with all the masks.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.751
They look more drunk than Demon.

33:53.785 --> 33:55.285
Yeah, you're thinking
of the Christian version,

33:55.319 --> 33:57.187
like little horns and red suits
and stuff.

33:57.221 --> 33:59.624
Demons actually
way pre-date Christianity.

33:59.657 --> 34:01.526
Back in Dante's time
they weren't really considered

34:01.559 --> 34:03.327
to be part of Satan's squad.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.195
- What were they then?
- Demons were people.

34:05.229 --> 34:08.198
People who had gone off.

34:08.232 --> 34:09.601
They were said to be
'born of suffering',

34:09.634 --> 34:12.470
creatures created 'of pain'.

34:12.504 --> 34:15.138
Intense suffering,
if you survived it,

34:15.172 --> 34:17.341
could turn you into
something powerful.

34:17.374 --> 34:20.344
Suffering, from like, rats?

34:20.377 --> 34:21.546
Or like from the cold?

34:21.579 --> 34:22.780
You're shit at history.

34:22.814 --> 34:23.982
I am shit at history.

34:24.014 --> 34:26.651
Okay, it's medieval Europe,
so you got like Inquisition,

34:26.684 --> 34:29.319
you got Famine, Plague,
pick your dinner party!

34:29.353 --> 34:30.655
Okay, I get it,
things were tougher...

34:30.688 --> 34:32.790
A little tougher!

34:32.824 --> 34:34.391
- I suffer.
- How.

34:38.596 --> 34:40.430
When my wi-fi is slow.

34:40.465 --> 34:41.633
- Suffering's changed.
- Yes.

34:41.666 --> 34:42.767
Okay, fine.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.167
Well maybe that's why
we see less demons these days

34:44.201 --> 34:45.503
"Those that hide their eyes,

34:45.537 --> 34:47.404
those to take the earth
to ruin."

34:47.437 --> 34:48.272
It's so weird.

34:48.305 --> 34:50.440
It gets weirder, look.

34:50.475 --> 34:52.810
Do you see something,
other than the witch?

34:52.844 --> 34:54.111
Woah, what was that.

34:54.144 --> 34:55.245
It's a frame glitch.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.716
Let me bring it out.

35:01.786 --> 35:03.220
Jesus.

35:03.253 --> 35:05.757
4, 5.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.424
That is scary.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.192
Scarier than that witch.

35:09.226 --> 35:10.093
The guys that made it?

35:10.127 --> 35:11.629
Apparently.

35:11.663 --> 35:14.131
So what does that mean?

35:14.164 --> 35:14.966
Basically nothing.

35:14.999 --> 35:16.668
It's your typical
blackhat bullshit.

35:16.701 --> 35:18.670
Yeah, it seems pretty dumb.

35:18.703 --> 35:21.573
Still, that's weird.

35:21.606 --> 35:22.707
Cops. Upstairs.

35:22.740 --> 35:23.641
- What?!
- What?!

35:23.675 --> 35:24.609
Cops.

35:24.642 --> 35:26.343
Relax, it's not about us.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.277
It's about the guy who died.

35:27.311 --> 35:28.613
Someone died?

35:28.646 --> 35:29.681
The guy who freaked out.

35:29.714 --> 35:30.582
Wait what?

35:30.615 --> 35:31.816
Seriously?

35:31.849 --> 35:34.217
Ever heard of this thing
called "the news"?

35:34.251 --> 35:35.587
- Holy shit.
- Is that real?

35:35.620 --> 35:36.420
Is that real?!

35:36.454 --> 35:37.855
Shit, sorry.

35:37.889 --> 35:39.490
- He was your friend.
- No no, he was just...

35:39.524 --> 35:40.257
We saw him yesterday.

35:40.290 --> 35:41.793
What do you mean
he freaked out?

35:41.826 --> 35:43.761
He said someone was trying
to kill him.

35:43.795 --> 35:45.697
Then he went crazy,
ran off campus.

35:45.730 --> 35:47.331
This doesn't say where he died.

35:47.364 --> 35:48.566
At the playground.

36:04.849 --> 36:07.885
Both times it appeared,
it was in Zoe's room.

36:23.501 --> 36:26.370
So the meme connects
to her room somehow.

36:26.403 --> 36:28.372
Or her stuff.

36:28.405 --> 36:30.508
I mean, could it just be
the computer that's haunted,

36:30.541 --> 36:31.843
or whatever?

36:31.876 --> 36:34.311
I cloned the drive,
it didn't seem haunted.

36:34.344 --> 36:36.514
What about back there,
all those cords and shit?

36:40.952 --> 36:42.487
It's just cords and shit.

36:42.520 --> 36:43.721
And dust.

36:45.823 --> 36:48.225
I have no idea
what we're doing.

36:58.836 --> 37:00.203
It's the closet!

37:00.237 --> 37:01.472
We were in there
when Bubbles came over,

37:01.506 --> 37:02.974
and Zoe was in there the night
that she died.

37:03.007 --> 37:04.842
It is the fucking closet!

37:04.876 --> 37:06.276
Okay, watch the screen.

37:15.486 --> 37:17.689
Spencer!

37:17.722 --> 37:18.656
It's the floor.

37:18.690 --> 37:19.490
It's my name again.

37:19.524 --> 37:21.492
It must be whoever's closest
maybe.

37:21.526 --> 37:24.294
- Okay, I have to answer.
- Yeah.

37:24.327 --> 37:25.830
It's not... the mouse!

37:25.863 --> 37:26.964
- Did you unplug this?!
- Shit.

37:26.998 --> 37:28.800
Fuck.

37:28.833 --> 37:29.901
Alright, you're good.

37:29.934 --> 37:32.269
- There you go.
- Shit.

37:32.302 --> 37:33.403
The keyboard's out!

37:33.437 --> 37:34.204
Fuck sakes, Spencer!

37:34.237 --> 37:35.405
I see it, shit! Sorry!

37:35.439 --> 37:37.340
20 seconds, hurry!

37:37.374 --> 37:39.443
Yeah, you're good.

37:39.477 --> 37:40.478
Oh my God!

37:40.511 --> 37:41.512
Fuck!

37:41.546 --> 37:42.547
Shit!

37:42.580 --> 37:44.649
- Okay.
- Oh my God.

37:54.459 --> 37:55.960
Oh my God, fuck.

38:00.498 --> 38:01.799
Fucking hell.

38:01.833 --> 38:04.969
The floor's the trigger,
I dropped a weight right on it.

38:05.002 --> 38:07.337
A haunted closet.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.606
Holy shit.

38:08.639 --> 38:09.907
It drops half an inch here.

38:09.941 --> 38:11.408
Dude, I'm not going in there!

38:11.441 --> 38:12.510
Watch the screen again.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.519
Just... just go slow!

38:24.922 --> 38:26.457
Brick.

38:26.491 --> 38:29.460
Some are rotting.

38:29.494 --> 38:32.897
This one's loose.

38:32.930 --> 38:34.565
They bricked something up.

38:34.599 --> 38:37.635
Like what?

38:37.668 --> 38:40.605
Okay, so this overlay
has the original 14 structures

38:40.638 --> 38:41.706
from 1860.

38:41.739 --> 38:43.808
And you can see
the tunnel system

38:43.841 --> 38:45.375
linking them all, here.

38:45.408 --> 38:46.811
So these are the old
tunnels, right?

38:46.844 --> 38:48.479
Yes, this network here.

38:48.513 --> 38:51.015
Let me see if I can find this
on a better...

38:51.048 --> 38:53.450
I played Dungeons & Dragons
down here once.

38:53.484 --> 38:54.919
- Spooky!
- Stop trying to out-nerd me.

38:56.821 --> 38:59.924
Yes this one's better,
you can see what's changed.

38:59.957 --> 39:02.660
So Greyson House used to be
part of the old hospital?

39:02.693 --> 39:03.694
Yeah, this whole area did.

39:03.728 --> 39:05.830
Greyson, Lennox, Henry.

39:05.863 --> 39:07.765
And when did it become
a residence?

39:07.799 --> 39:08.866
Greyson House.

39:08.900 --> 39:11.434
2002?

39:11.469 --> 39:12.470
Yes.

39:12.503 --> 39:15.506
Before it was just a normal
hospital building?

39:15.540 --> 39:17.575
Well, all the residences
were patient care.

39:17.608 --> 39:21.546
And this whole area here
was pediatric,

39:21.579 --> 39:24.048
and Greyson House was...

39:24.081 --> 39:25.049
palliative.

39:25.082 --> 39:26.851
Oh my God.

39:26.884 --> 39:28.719
- Wait, what's palliative again?
- Terminal.

39:28.753 --> 39:30.988
So you're saying
that our dorm rooms

39:31.022 --> 39:33.825
used to house dying children.

39:33.858 --> 39:35.392
Some did, I'm afraid so.

39:35.425 --> 39:36.961
Children that were dying.

39:36.994 --> 39:39.063
Do you know anything about
this part here?

39:39.096 --> 39:42.066
That was a cancer hospice.

39:42.099 --> 39:43.034
Oh, that's right,

39:43.067 --> 39:44.836
the last of the Balloon Babies
were there!

39:44.869 --> 39:47.370
- What?
- Hold on.

39:47.404 --> 39:49.040
This is roughly Zoe's dorm

39:49.073 --> 39:51.609
and there's stairs
that go down to a sub basement.

39:51.642 --> 39:54.812
But in the 2010 map the stairs
and the basement are gone.

39:54.846 --> 39:55.746
Bricked up?

39:55.780 --> 39:56.814
Maybe.

39:56.848 --> 39:59.150
Excuse me,
there's a staircase here

39:59.183 --> 40:00.685
and it's not in this map,

40:00.718 --> 40:01.919
do you know what would have
happened to it?

40:01.953 --> 40:04.755
Filled in, abandoned maybe?

40:04.789 --> 40:06.657
Here,
it's one of the better books.

40:06.691 --> 40:08.793
There's a whole section in 920.

40:08.826 --> 40:10.628
"Balloon Babies
and Jelly Children

40:10.661 --> 40:11.796
of the Northeast"

40:11.829 --> 40:12.463
Are you kidding,
this can't be a thing!

40:12.496 --> 40:13.531
What is this?

40:13.564 --> 40:15.166
It was a
disease cluster in the 80s.

40:15.199 --> 40:17.602
In the river basin, that area.

40:17.635 --> 40:19.436
It was a chemical leak
that affected newborns.

40:19.470 --> 40:22.740
Balloon Babies
and Jelly Children?

40:22.773 --> 40:25.710
Named for the way their flesh
grew uncontrollably.

40:25.743 --> 40:27.912
These kids
were seriously disfigured.

40:27.945 --> 40:30.081
This is disturbing.

40:30.114 --> 40:31.082
Most covered their faces.

40:31.115 --> 40:33.484
Not one lived past their teens.

40:33.517 --> 40:35.653
It's a very sad story.

40:35.686 --> 40:37.188
These kids lived in Greyson?

40:37.221 --> 40:38.122
They did.

40:38.155 --> 40:39.891
Also, hang on.

40:41.926 --> 40:44.161
Oh.

40:44.195 --> 40:45.930
My God.

40:48.766 --> 40:50.668
The Halloween Party.

40:50.701 --> 40:52.570
There's a documentary.

40:52.603 --> 40:55.706
The DVD is missing,
but we do have it on 16mm.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.843
We've got some portable
projectors and screens.

40:58.876 --> 41:02.013
It's a bit dated,
but you might learn something.

41:02.046 --> 41:03.147
Wow, just...

41:03.180 --> 41:03.981
wow.

41:04.015 --> 41:06.884
- Could we borrow all this?
- Yes.

41:06.918 --> 41:08.219
This is a library.

41:08.252 --> 41:11.956
Always wondered
how you guys worked.

41:11.989 --> 41:12.890
God.

41:12.924 --> 41:14.892
How did people watch stuff
in the old days?

41:14.926 --> 41:18.129
Seriously, people were basically
animals before Netflix.

41:19.230 --> 41:21.632
...that's
because they were condemned

41:21.666 --> 41:24.635
even before they were born.

41:24.669 --> 41:26.904
But the lack
of safety enforcement

41:26.938 --> 41:28.873
led to a chemical leak.

41:28.906 --> 41:31.676
The chemists at the factory
were using a new dye

41:31.709 --> 41:36.247
which contained a compound
called Fallocarbide.

41:36.280 --> 41:40.217
Once it got into the river
and the surrounding groundwater

41:40.251 --> 41:44.121
the compound broke down
into its component elements

41:44.155 --> 41:48.759
some of which possessed
horrendous toxicity.

41:48.793 --> 41:51.796
It affected an entire
generation.

41:51.829 --> 41:55.666
You see Fallocarbide
wreaked havoc

41:55.700 --> 41:57.668
upon the human fetus.

42:05.710 --> 42:07.745
Oh my god.

42:07.778 --> 42:09.880
And there were many children...

42:09.914 --> 42:12.717
I am so fucking upset right now.

42:12.750 --> 42:13.751
Those kids.

42:13.784 --> 42:16.220
You know, I thought
I didn't want kids before,

42:16.253 --> 42:18.589
but I can literally feel
my ovaries

42:18.622 --> 42:19.623
going into my armpits.

42:19.657 --> 42:21.826
Why are we watching this?

42:21.859 --> 42:23.194
Why do you keep taking pictures
of it?

42:23.227 --> 42:24.295
I... I don't know.

42:24.328 --> 42:26.163
I... doesn't this disturb you
that these kids lived

42:26.197 --> 42:26.998
in our dorm rooms?

42:27.031 --> 42:28.866
It's nuts!

42:30.134 --> 42:31.669
Jesus.

42:37.041 --> 42:38.209
Hey, hey, hey,
I got something.

42:38.242 --> 42:39.510
It forwarded?

42:41.912 --> 42:42.546
Is that it?

42:42.580 --> 42:43.681
What's that spinning thing?

42:43.714 --> 42:46.684
Kind of a robot, it's putting
a shell on for a scan.

42:46.717 --> 42:48.586
Spencer, we have to destroy
this thing.

42:48.619 --> 42:52.323
After the scan's done
I'll kill it.

42:52.356 --> 42:53.924
Do you think it actually works?

42:53.958 --> 42:56.127
Do you think that
Zoe got killed by a Pigman

42:56.160 --> 42:58.963
and then Bubbles' worst fear
just came to life?

42:58.996 --> 43:00.831
I don't know,
but I'll tell you this,

43:00.865 --> 43:02.733
if that happened to me,
I would not sit around

43:02.767 --> 43:04.135
and scream like
I was in a horror movie.

43:04.168 --> 43:06.037
I would drop everything,
get in the car,

43:06.070 --> 43:07.204
and drive to fucking Cleveland!

43:07.238 --> 43:08.806
- Airport.
- Even better.

43:13.811 --> 43:16.180
The Halloween Party.

43:16.213 --> 43:18.282
Looks like a birthday.

43:20.351 --> 43:22.953
Um, can I ask you something?

43:24.055 --> 43:25.589
Vagina spiders.

43:25.623 --> 43:26.357
Spencer!

43:26.390 --> 43:27.591
- Well what...
- Oh my god!

43:27.625 --> 43:29.260
You typed it in and I was there,
and I've never heard of that

43:29.293 --> 43:30.961
- so I kind of like wondered.
- Alright, fine.

43:30.995 --> 43:31.762
When I was a little girl,

43:31.796 --> 43:33.764
I fell asleep on the beach
one time

43:33.798 --> 43:35.599
and when I woke up
I had a tummy ache,

43:35.633 --> 43:37.768
and my sister told me that
while I was asleep,

43:37.802 --> 43:41.072
a spider had crawled "up there"
and laid eggs.

43:45.976 --> 43:47.778
So...

43:47.812 --> 43:49.213
they're real?!

43:49.246 --> 43:50.347
- You're an idiot.
- What?!

43:50.381 --> 43:51.248
You said you had a tummy ache!

43:51.282 --> 43:53.684
It was old potato salad
or something,

43:53.717 --> 43:55.619
my sister was joking around,
she was pranking me.

43:55.653 --> 43:56.887
Aah, okay.

43:58.255 --> 43:59.056
Okay.

43:59.090 --> 44:00.057
Anyway, I believed her
at the time,

44:00.091 --> 44:02.359
and ever since then
I've hated crawly things,

44:02.393 --> 44:04.061
I'm just scared of
where they'll go!

44:04.095 --> 44:05.262
Yeah, that's fair.

44:05.296 --> 44:07.264
What about you,
what's your worst fear?

44:07.298 --> 44:09.033
Bears.

44:09.066 --> 44:10.367
That was fast.

44:10.401 --> 44:12.103
What's the story with that?

44:12.136 --> 44:13.771
Why do I need a story?!

44:13.804 --> 44:15.139
Their jaws can crush
bowling balls!

44:15.172 --> 44:16.707
They're killing machines!

44:16.740 --> 44:17.708
It's just random.

44:17.741 --> 44:19.310
I just can't believe
that we live in a world

44:19.343 --> 44:22.012
where there's bears
running around, right now,

44:22.046 --> 44:24.381
this very second, outside,
hungry,

44:24.415 --> 44:26.817
and we're worried about ISIS?

44:26.851 --> 44:28.018
It makes no sense!

44:32.790 --> 44:34.358
Did you just see that?

45:10.227 --> 45:12.464
They were placed in a ward,

45:12.497 --> 45:15.065
part of the palliative
care wing.

45:15.099 --> 45:16.967
And the goal
was to keep them busy

45:17.001 --> 45:19.336
to try to distract them
from their pain

45:19.370 --> 45:20.838
and from their anguish.

45:43.427 --> 45:45.829
An "intus etin" state,
which literally means

45:45.863 --> 45:49.900
"to be born inside-out".

45:49.934 --> 45:54.472
And yet he survived, placed
in a modified hospital bag.

45:54.506 --> 45:56.040
Chronic bleeding.

45:56.073 --> 45:58.075
Respiratory issues.

45:58.108 --> 46:03.080
His entire life spent
in unimaginable agony.

46:03.113 --> 46:06.083
And yet despite all that
showing a remarkable

46:06.116 --> 46:07.485
will to survive.

46:07.519 --> 46:09.019
To live.

46:17.861 --> 46:19.897
Good lord!

46:19.930 --> 46:23.901
Balloon Babies
are absolutely fucked!

46:23.934 --> 46:26.471
- They're totally fucked!
- Oh my god.

46:26.504 --> 46:28.172
Tomorrow's
Halloween, that is timing!

46:28.205 --> 46:29.974
Spencer, look at this!

46:30.007 --> 46:32.544
Do you see?

46:32.577 --> 46:33.844
- Computers?
- Yeah.

46:33.877 --> 46:35.279
That's something.

46:35.312 --> 46:36.780
- We need to talk to someone.
- Him.

46:36.814 --> 46:39.783
But gradually one by one
they died,

46:39.817 --> 46:43.988
until all but a few bed-ridden
cases remained.

46:44.021 --> 46:45.222
Got him.

46:45.256 --> 46:47.124
Doctor Arthur MaCail,
he retired '09.

46:47.157 --> 46:48.792
His wife
is a Doctor Barbara MaCail,

46:48.826 --> 46:50.427
and two kids,
Leo and Alison.

46:50.462 --> 46:51.895
You're like a superhero.

46:51.929 --> 46:52.763
There's a phone number.

46:52.796 --> 46:54.365
No way,
calling is way too intense.

46:54.398 --> 46:56.033
He's like 70.

46:56.066 --> 46:58.936
Okay yeah,
we'll send him a snap-chat.

46:58.969 --> 47:00.004
You're starting to grow on me.

47:00.037 --> 47:01.573
It's ringing.

47:01.606 --> 47:02.973
What?!

47:13.450 --> 47:14.418
Hello, Grace!

47:14.451 --> 47:16.820
Doctor MaCail,
thanks so much for having us!

47:16.854 --> 47:19.290
- Come in, come in!
- Okay, thank you so much.

47:19.323 --> 47:22.926
Arthur will be up in a jiff.

47:22.960 --> 47:25.296
Oh, we've just been
setting things out

47:25.329 --> 47:28.065
for the children later,
but help yourself if you like!

47:28.098 --> 47:29.166
- Oh, I'm fine.
- I'm good thanks.

47:29.199 --> 47:31.001
Or would you like a fruit shake?

47:31.035 --> 47:32.169
I've just had one!

47:32.202 --> 47:34.171
They're fantastic!

47:35.640 --> 47:36.373
Yeah!

47:36.407 --> 47:38.242
Thanks!

47:38.275 --> 47:40.478
Of course, I wouldn't have
been involved if not for Arthur.

47:40.512 --> 47:44.181
Sick children are the saddest
thing you can imagine.

47:44.214 --> 47:45.583
They are.

47:47.251 --> 47:49.253
You're making it less sad.

47:49.286 --> 47:50.354
Sorry.

47:50.387 --> 47:51.322
It's a good shake, yes?

47:51.355 --> 47:53.491
So good.

47:53.525 --> 47:55.125
Right then,
so what about this photo.

47:55.159 --> 47:57.961
Of course, they are in here.

47:57.995 --> 47:58.630
My heart.

47:58.663 --> 48:00.465
May I?

48:00.498 --> 48:02.333
You can't remember
every patient,

48:02.366 --> 48:07.639
but these children, I think
I recall every one of them.

48:07.672 --> 48:11.041
They we're so young here!

48:11.075 --> 48:13.511
Oh, Michael.

48:13.545 --> 48:15.312
Bone problems I'm afraid.

48:17.381 --> 48:19.350
And Laurence.

48:19.383 --> 48:20.951
They loved their bricks.

48:25.022 --> 48:27.391
Now that's a happy day.

48:27.424 --> 48:31.629
That's how I like
to remember them!

48:31.663 --> 48:34.965
"The Halloween Party"
what does that mean?

48:34.998 --> 48:36.534
That's what they called them.

48:36.568 --> 48:38.335
Why would they call them that?

48:38.369 --> 48:41.138
- The masks, and the hoods.
- Of course.

48:41.171 --> 48:42.574
For you it's just one day
a year,

48:42.607 --> 48:46.611
but for them,
Halloween was every day.

48:46.644 --> 48:49.246
It was a cruel nickname.

48:49.279 --> 48:50.648
That's the photo right there.

48:50.682 --> 48:52.484
Oh yes,
the older ones had a club.

48:52.517 --> 48:53.485
With computers?

48:53.518 --> 48:55.185
Yes, they were teenagers.

48:55.219 --> 48:57.020
What would they do in that club?

48:57.054 --> 49:00.224
I suppose whatever one does
with computers.

49:00.257 --> 49:02.059
The staff appreciated it.

49:02.092 --> 49:04.562
They were terrible to the staff
at this point.

49:04.596 --> 49:05.996
What do you mean?

49:09.433 --> 49:16.641
As they got older,
they became something else.

49:16.674 --> 49:18.476
It happens
with the terminally ill.

49:18.510 --> 49:21.412
I'm not sure that I understand.

49:21.445 --> 49:23.447
Imagine being born disfigured.

49:23.481 --> 49:25.382
Your home, the hospital.

49:25.416 --> 49:27.652
Tied to machines
that are breathing for you

49:27.685 --> 49:29.052
and pumping for you.

49:29.086 --> 49:31.589
Your condition worsening.

49:31.623 --> 49:34.559
Your flesh growing
out of control.

49:34.592 --> 49:38.962
And your loved ones visiting
less and less often

49:38.996 --> 49:44.268
until one day those visits
just stop.

49:44.301 --> 49:49.139
These children felt
all of that.

49:49.173 --> 49:54.411
We watched each one
lose everything.

49:54.445 --> 49:58.616
It would twist them
into something no longer human.

49:58.650 --> 50:02.454
A creature wanting to lash out.

50:02.487 --> 50:04.087
At who?

50:04.121 --> 50:06.758
At the company that poisoned
the ground.

50:06.791 --> 50:09.092
At the city that let them.

50:09.126 --> 50:11.995
At the people
who just wanted to forget.

50:12.029 --> 50:13.163
Us.

50:13.197 --> 50:14.364
Yes.

50:14.398 --> 50:15.600
They blamed us for their fate.

50:15.633 --> 50:16.568
All of us.

50:16.601 --> 50:17.401
And at the very end

50:17.434 --> 50:20.505
they were no longer
sick children.

50:20.538 --> 50:22.272
They were monsters.

50:22.306 --> 50:24.174
What did you mean
at the very end?

50:24.208 --> 50:27.311
They took themselves off
of assisted care.

50:27.344 --> 50:29.046
The remaining five.

50:29.079 --> 50:31.281
I imagine the pain
was too great.

50:31.315 --> 50:33.417
- Suicide.
- Oh my God.

50:33.450 --> 50:38.222
And I believe
it was time to let them rest.

50:40.123 --> 50:42.192
Ma'am?

50:42.226 --> 50:43.260
Ah, thank you.

50:43.293 --> 50:44.294
Arthur's up, shall we-

50:44.328 --> 50:46.230
Doctor MaCail,
does this mean anything to you?

50:50.735 --> 50:51.803
No.

50:51.836 --> 50:55.072
No, I don't know what that is.

50:55.105 --> 50:56.440
Come, we'll ask Arthur.

51:13.423 --> 51:17.327
Oh Darling, come, up we go.

51:17.361 --> 51:19.631
Darling,
these are the young people

51:19.664 --> 51:20.865
I told you about
from the university

51:20.899 --> 51:24.569
who want to ask some questions
about children's palliative.

51:31.609 --> 51:34.077
Hey Doctor MaCail,
so nice to meet you.

51:35.613 --> 51:37.381
H.

51:37.414 --> 51:39.082
E.

51:39.116 --> 51:40.485
L.

51:40.518 --> 51:41.753
L.

51:41.786 --> 51:43.621
O.

51:43.655 --> 51:46.423
Hello.

51:46.457 --> 51:48.325
Hello!

51:48.358 --> 51:50.294
Thank you so much
for having us!

51:50.327 --> 51:54.766
Your home is beautiful
and Barbara has been lovely!

51:54.799 --> 51:58.201
She made us a fruit shake
which was very good!

51:58.235 --> 52:01.138
Well, we were just interested
in the work that you did,

52:01.171 --> 52:05.342
in the documentary that you had,
many years ago, had the uhh...

52:05.375 --> 52:07.244
Well, we enjoyed watch...

52:07.277 --> 52:09.747
But we had some questions
about it as well,

52:09.781 --> 52:13.751
so just kinda wanted
to talk about that and...

52:13.785 --> 52:15.653
- Here try this.
- Okay.

52:15.687 --> 52:17.822
That's good.

52:17.855 --> 52:20.324
Sir, do you recognize
this image?

52:29.901 --> 52:31.335
Arthur?!

52:31.368 --> 52:32.369
Arthur?!

52:32.402 --> 52:33.538
Arthur?!

52:33.571 --> 52:34.371
L L L L L L L L L L

52:34.404 --> 52:36.139
Arthur?!

52:36.173 --> 52:37.709
Please.

52:37.742 --> 52:39.276
Arthur?!

52:39.309 --> 52:41.311
Arthur?!

52:50.420 --> 52:51.254
Leave!

52:56.226 --> 52:57.629
- We are so sorry.
- That's alright.

52:57.662 --> 53:00.665
Attacks happen I'm afraid.

53:00.698 --> 53:04.234
Thank you for understanding.

53:04.267 --> 53:06.370
My dear,
would you wait a minute?

53:06.403 --> 53:07.572
Of course.

53:11.375 --> 53:12.777
I wanted to give you this.

53:12.810 --> 53:16.581
Arthur gave it to me,
it's an Indonesian Garuda,

53:16.614 --> 53:19.784
a talisman of luck
and protection.

53:19.817 --> 53:22.754
Something tells me
you may need it.

53:22.787 --> 53:25.757
In the end,
the children wanted to hurt us.

53:31.929 --> 53:34.866
Bring that back,
it means something to me.

53:34.899 --> 53:36.467
Thank you.

53:39.871 --> 53:41.539
What the hell was that?!

53:41.572 --> 53:42.439
L L L L!

53:42.473 --> 53:43.741
- Sounded like hell, hell, hell-
- I know!

53:43.775 --> 53:45.543
What was he trying to say,
flee?

53:45.576 --> 53:46.744
- FLLLEEEEEEEEEE!
- Could have been anything,

53:46.778 --> 53:47.645
I swear a little poop
came out of me!

53:47.679 --> 53:48.980
Maybe he was just in pain
or something?

53:49.013 --> 53:50.748
He was definitely
trying to say something!

53:53.484 --> 53:56.219
Spencer, those kids died
down there.

53:56.253 --> 53:58.623
And when you hit the brick
it disrupts their grave!

53:58.656 --> 54:01.291
- We need to tell someone.
- And say what?

54:01.324 --> 54:02.593
Oh hey guys, guess what.

54:02.627 --> 54:04.394
It actually turns out
that Zoe's closet

54:04.428 --> 54:05.663
is the grave
of the Halloween Party.

54:05.697 --> 54:06.864
Oh, who's that you ask?

54:06.898 --> 54:09.734
Well, it's just a hacker group
of revenge-seeking demons.

54:09.767 --> 54:11.234
You know,
some deformed teenagers

54:11.268 --> 54:12.837
that, in a suicide pact,
poured their souls

54:12.870 --> 54:14.572
into the world's scariest virus.

54:14.605 --> 54:16.273
Which, by the way,
fucking works,

54:16.306 --> 54:17.975
and will kill you
with your own worst nightmare!

54:21.846 --> 54:23.346
It doesn't sound good.

54:23.380 --> 54:25.449
No.

54:25.483 --> 54:27.250
We just leave it
and we hope no one disturbs it?

54:27.284 --> 54:28.285
It's pretty hard to disturb.

54:28.318 --> 54:28.820
We disturbed it.

54:28.853 --> 54:29.821
Three times.

54:29.854 --> 54:31.589
- Someone else will.
- That's not our problem.

54:31.622 --> 54:33.024
Not if their worst fear
is airborne Ebola,

54:33.057 --> 54:34.859
that's everybody's problem.

54:34.892 --> 54:36.694
Spencer, we have to delete it.

54:36.728 --> 54:37.795
And then we have to fix
the brick.

54:37.829 --> 54:39.429
And we can't tell anyone
about it.

54:39.464 --> 54:41.298
Not a soul.

54:45.470 --> 54:46.369
You told someone!

54:46.403 --> 54:47.237
Just a couple guys at the lab

54:47.270 --> 54:48.539
and they actually helped me
catch it!

54:48.573 --> 54:49.807
Why didn't you delete it
last night!

54:49.841 --> 54:51.809
You need to destroy this thing
like yesterday!

54:56.647 --> 54:59.050
Okay, it's done.

54:59.083 --> 55:00.450
It's done.
It's gone.

55:00.485 --> 55:01.753
It's deleted.

55:01.786 --> 55:04.455
- It's gone?
- Gone.

55:04.489 --> 55:06.289
Oh.

55:06.323 --> 55:07.290
- That was fast.
- It's not that hard.

55:07.324 --> 55:08.693
You just go in and hit delete.

55:08.726 --> 55:10.595
Problem solved.

55:10.628 --> 55:11.763
Problem solved.

55:11.796 --> 55:12.730
And that's all of it?

55:12.764 --> 55:13.998
There's the email that
it was attached to,

55:14.031 --> 55:16.433
so if we want to be super safe
you could drop me at the lab now

55:16.467 --> 55:18.002
I'll go in and delete it
right away.

55:18.035 --> 55:20.370
Tomorrow, we'll get some mortar,
we'll fix up the closet floor,

55:20.403 --> 55:22.774
and it will be sealed for good.

55:22.807 --> 55:24.475
Okay.

55:24.509 --> 55:26.409
This is going better
than I thought.

55:26.443 --> 55:28.746
I might actually sleep tonight,
not wake up screaming,

55:28.780 --> 55:30.447
being chased by the Pigman.

55:30.481 --> 55:31.582
Chased by The Halloween Party.

55:31.616 --> 55:32.884
Ugh God, exactly.

55:32.917 --> 55:34.786
- Wow, those kids!
- They're fucked.

55:34.819 --> 55:36.954
Seriously, I think something
finally beats bears.

55:36.988 --> 55:38.523
You're insane,
bears are cuddly.

55:38.556 --> 55:39.857
You're a crazy person.

55:39.891 --> 55:41.291
My God.

55:43.961 --> 55:45.062
Hey.

55:45.096 --> 55:45.930
Do you know
if Spencer's horror meme

55:45.963 --> 55:47.064
is in the Box?

55:47.098 --> 55:48.365
No idea what you're on about.

55:48.398 --> 55:49.634
His Halloween thing.

55:49.667 --> 55:51.669
- You don't know about it!?
- No.

55:51.702 --> 55:53.638
It asks your worst fear,
and if you don't answer

55:53.671 --> 55:55.807
before the clock runs out,
that fear comes to life.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.809
Well, I doubt it because,
you know, real life.

55:57.842 --> 55:59.010
The guy who died,
he watched it.

55:59.043 --> 56:00.578
You think a meme
killed Darren Danowski?

56:00.611 --> 56:02.547
You guys talking about
the horror app?

56:02.580 --> 56:04.882
Susy Landlow was in the class
the day Bubbles died.

56:04.916 --> 56:06.717
She said he came in
laughing about it.

56:06.751 --> 56:08.085
An hour later, dead!

56:08.119 --> 56:09.053
Okay, I need to see this thing.

56:09.086 --> 56:10.454
I'd put the Shining Twins,

56:10.488 --> 56:11.421
imagine them
running around campus.

56:11.455 --> 56:12.089
You'd just fall in love.

56:12.123 --> 56:13.658
I'd put dinosaurs!

56:13.691 --> 56:15.126
Fight them
with construction equipment,

56:15.159 --> 56:16.861
I would Michael Bay up
that shit!

56:16.894 --> 56:17.728
Lipman!

56:17.762 --> 56:19.597
Can you get in
to Spencer's horror app?

56:19.630 --> 56:21.666
No, it's in the Box.

56:21.699 --> 56:22.700
Where's his laptop.

56:22.733 --> 56:23.968
I can get in there...

56:30.875 --> 56:33.544
Okay, text me.

56:33.578 --> 56:35.580
It's starting already.

56:35.613 --> 56:37.982
Gah, that's all we need,
more kids in masks.

56:38.015 --> 56:39.416
No kidding.

56:39.449 --> 56:40.751
Okay, text you
when it's deleted.

56:40.785 --> 56:41.953
- Okay bye.
- Bye.

57:01.205 --> 57:02.640
Motherfucker!

57:02.673 --> 57:04.041
Who?!

57:04.075 --> 57:05.509
Who?!

57:05.543 --> 57:06.409
- Everybody.
- Don't be...

57:06.443 --> 57:07.377
Who answered it?
Who answered it?

57:07.410 --> 57:08.913
- Did you see a witch?
- There was a-

57:08.946 --> 57:09.981
Did you see a witch?

57:10.014 --> 57:12.717
No, I typed clowns
and saw little dancing ghosts!

57:12.750 --> 57:13.718
- It said 'saved'!
- It said 'saved'!

57:13.751 --> 57:15.119
- Not a big deal man!
- Sorry, Spencer man.

57:15.152 --> 57:16.587
It forwards!

57:16.621 --> 57:18.155
Garret, Garret, okay.

57:18.189 --> 57:19.056
- Garret.
- Forwards?

57:19.090 --> 57:20.124
An email?

57:39.510 --> 57:41.078
One.

57:41.112 --> 57:42.980
Two.

57:43.014 --> 57:44.782
Three.

57:44.815 --> 57:47.118
Four.

57:47.151 --> 57:48.152
Five.

58:17.548 --> 58:18.849
Guys, I'm so stoked for tonight.

58:18.883 --> 58:20.651
Like, I want to die tonight.

58:20.685 --> 58:21.252
I'm not even kidding.

58:21.285 --> 58:22.887
I want to die of booze.

58:22.920 --> 58:24.555
Do you think we got enough?

58:24.588 --> 58:27.558
Garret, my son, there's enough
liquor in this room

58:27.591 --> 58:28.993
to get the Russian army drunk.

58:29.026 --> 58:30.594
Fuck you!

58:30.628 --> 58:31.662
I see your point, Michael.

58:31.696 --> 58:32.563
We could always use more.

58:32.596 --> 58:33.698
We can always use more!

58:33.731 --> 58:35.800
I'm worried it's going
to catch on fire or something.

58:35.833 --> 58:36.701
It could happen.

58:36.734 --> 58:40.204
Gentlemen, I predict 100 years
from now,

58:40.237 --> 58:42.506
they're going to be singing
folk songs in the mountains

58:42.540 --> 58:43.708
about this Halloween party.

58:43.741 --> 58:45.142
Dude, I am so pumped.

58:45.176 --> 58:46.344
Yo, want some punch.

58:46.377 --> 58:49.513
No, I can't be slurring
when handing candy to children.

58:49.547 --> 58:51.515
- Sounds like a wager to me man.
- Candy?

58:51.549 --> 58:52.950
This Halloween
let's give out soup.

58:52.984 --> 58:54.518
Yeah, he's right here.

58:54.552 --> 58:56.687
Hey Garret, someone for ya bro.

58:56.721 --> 58:58.823
Spence, what's up homeslice.

58:58.856 --> 59:00.558
Spence, whatcha drinking pal.

59:00.591 --> 59:01.826
Heya Garret,
have you checked your phone,

59:01.859 --> 59:02.893
did you get an email?

59:02.927 --> 59:04.261
Uhh, no, no,
phone's upstairs I think.

59:04.295 --> 59:06.530
You look like you're going
to have a heart attack, Spencer.

59:06.564 --> 59:07.865
Have some relaxing punch, dude.

59:07.898 --> 59:08.866
I'm good, thanks.

59:08.899 --> 59:10.601
Whose is this, can I?

59:10.634 --> 59:12.570
Our house is your house,
Spencer.

59:12.603 --> 59:14.205
Just bear with me alright,
this is important.

59:14.238 --> 59:15.906
Can you bring up your email?

59:18.042 --> 59:19.310
- What's going on brah?
- Ooo.

59:19.343 --> 59:20.311
- Is this about that horror app?
- No way!

59:20.344 --> 59:22.013
- It is isn't it!?
- It totally is, isn't it!

59:22.046 --> 59:22.980
What horror app?

59:23.014 --> 59:24.648
The meme, you know the one
that got Bubbs!

59:24.682 --> 59:25.783
There's this witch
that's so scary

59:25.816 --> 59:28.052
it actually drives you insane,
is that right, Spence?

59:28.085 --> 59:30.021
That sounds totally real.

59:30.054 --> 59:32.656
Okay, just put your password in
but don't hit enter.

59:32.690 --> 59:34.091
Because then the whole thing
is going to...

59:34.125 --> 59:36.727
- Shit!
- Is that it?

59:36.761 --> 59:37.762
What's this?

59:37.795 --> 59:38.896
Dude that's it, I told you!

59:38.929 --> 59:40.598
But what are you really
afraid of?

59:40.631 --> 59:41.999
- What the hell is this?
- Listen to me.

59:42.033 --> 59:43.300
You have to put your
very worst fear

59:43.334 --> 59:44.602
before that counter hits zero.

59:44.635 --> 59:45.936
And you have to be honest.

59:45.970 --> 59:46.737
Fucking awesome!

59:46.771 --> 59:47.772
What happens
if he doesn't do it,

59:47.805 --> 59:48.672
does he die?

59:48.706 --> 59:50.074
Is this really the thing
that Bubbles did?

59:50.107 --> 59:51.575
Seriously, he dies?

59:51.609 --> 59:52.576
This is the greatest moment
of my life.

59:52.610 --> 59:53.811
Fucking awesome!

59:53.844 --> 59:54.912
I don't know
what I'm afraid of!

59:54.945 --> 59:55.713
Put 'sex with Ribicki'.

59:55.746 --> 59:57.648
You're not afraid
of nothing tiger!

59:57.681 --> 1:00:00.051
Will you guys shut up!

1:00:00.084 --> 1:00:02.787
Garret, just focus alright,
the key is honesty.

1:00:02.820 --> 1:00:03.687
Can you just do it?

1:00:03.721 --> 1:00:04.989
No man, it's in your name.

1:00:05.022 --> 1:00:06.757
When was the last time
you were really scared.

1:00:06.791 --> 1:00:08.159
A movie maybe?

1:00:08.192 --> 1:00:09.326
- I dunno.
- 20 seconds, Schmitty.

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:11.662
You gotta go deep okay,
when were you scared as a kid.

1:00:11.695 --> 1:00:12.596
I don't know.

1:00:12.630 --> 1:00:14.098
Come on, worst childhood memory.

1:00:14.131 --> 1:00:15.066
There's got to be something.

1:00:15.099 --> 1:00:16.167
Uhh...

1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:17.268
- our deck?
- The deck!

1:00:17.301 --> 1:00:18.102
The deck is high?

1:00:18.135 --> 1:00:19.236
- You're scared of heights?
- No.

1:00:19.270 --> 1:00:20.237
What is it about the deck!

1:00:20.271 --> 1:00:21.939
- I fell off!
- Is that your fear, falling?!

1:00:21.972 --> 1:00:23.007
- No.
- 10 seconds!

1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:24.642
What about the deck scared you?!

1:00:24.675 --> 1:00:26.677
- I was pushed!
- Who pushed you?!

1:00:26.710 --> 1:00:28.145
- I...
- Who pushed you?!

1:00:28.179 --> 1:00:29.113
- 5...
- What are you scared of?

1:00:29.146 --> 1:00:31.749
- 4, 3, 2...
- Type it in, type it in now!

1:00:41.759 --> 1:00:43.360
Dude, where's the witch?!

1:00:43.394 --> 1:00:44.628
Is there no witch?

1:00:44.662 --> 1:00:47.031
That's lame.

1:00:47.064 --> 1:00:50.234
There's no witch unless
you let the counter run out.

1:00:50.267 --> 1:00:52.169
What the fuck was that, Spencer?

1:00:52.203 --> 1:00:53.838
Did you make that thing
to embarrass my friend?

1:00:53.871 --> 1:00:55.072
- No! That thing is real!
- You come in here,

1:00:55.106 --> 1:00:56.307
you mine for personal info,
and then you pull that shit?!

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:59.143
No, no man, that's real okay,
and it sends a random email

1:00:59.176 --> 1:01:01.245
- to a random contact...
- Woah...

1:01:01.278 --> 1:01:02.913
"A Halloween Party for Spencer"!

1:01:02.947 --> 1:01:04.215
Woah!

1:01:06.350 --> 1:01:08.252
- Woah, woah, grab his arm...
- What?!

1:01:08.285 --> 1:01:09.687
What!
What are you doing?!

1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:10.522
Fuck!

1:01:10.555 --> 1:01:11.956
We want to see
that witch Special.

1:01:11.989 --> 1:01:12.990
No, Court,
you've got to let me go.

1:01:13.023 --> 1:01:13.958
You don't understand okay!

1:01:13.991 --> 1:01:15.960
I don't have to do anything,
Special Needs.

1:01:15.993 --> 1:01:16.961
What the fuck!

1:01:16.994 --> 1:01:18.262
Garret, Garret, Garret,
please, come on man,

1:01:18.295 --> 1:01:19.130
just type for me okay,

1:01:19.163 --> 1:01:20.264
just type The Halloween Party,
okay.

1:01:20.297 --> 1:01:21.966
You know what?

1:01:21.999 --> 1:01:24.702
I think I want to see
that witch too, Spencer.

1:01:24.735 --> 1:01:26.871
C'mon, you can't let it run out,
don't let it run out guys!

1:01:26.904 --> 1:01:27.872
- 3...
- No, no!

1:01:27.905 --> 1:01:28.772
- 2...
- No!

1:01:28.806 --> 1:01:29.874
1...

1:01:33.043 --> 1:01:34.411
That's lame.

1:01:34.445 --> 1:01:36.247
Jesus Christ.

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.250
All this, for that?

1:01:39.283 --> 1:01:40.151
You are such a dick.

1:01:40.184 --> 1:01:42.253
Don't tell me,
now you're going to die

1:01:42.286 --> 1:01:44.955
because your little virus
said so, is that it?

1:01:44.989 --> 1:01:47.024
No Court, I'm not gonna die.

1:01:49.126 --> 1:01:50.127
We all are.

1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:57.401
Oh.

1:02:02.139 --> 1:02:03.874
We all are.

1:02:03.908 --> 1:02:04.875
Oh, whatever.

1:02:04.909 --> 1:02:07.111
Dude, he had the ending.

1:02:07.144 --> 1:02:10.014
I mean you gotta admit
that was a good ending.

1:02:10.047 --> 1:02:11.849
We all are.

1:02:11.882 --> 1:02:13.317
We all are.

1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:17.955
We all...

1:02:22.293 --> 1:02:23.961
- Arrrre.
- Will you shut up!

1:02:27.298 --> 1:02:28.732
<i>Hi, this is Grace.</i>

1:02:28.766 --> 1:02:29.668
<i>Really?
You're phoning me?</i>

1:02:29.700 --> 1:02:31.302
<i>What's wrong with you?
Okay just text...</i>

1:03:16.847 --> 1:03:19.250
Yeah, kids are out,
I'm going to get my costume.

1:03:19.283 --> 1:03:21.852
- What are you again?
- Surfer-Werewolf, dude.

1:03:21.885 --> 1:03:24.121
- What are you?
- A garbage bag.

1:03:24.154 --> 1:03:25.189
Of course, you are.

1:03:25.222 --> 1:03:27.424
Don't open that door yet,
I gotta drop some heat!

1:03:27.459 --> 1:03:28.926
The Mighty Bag shall wait

1:03:28.959 --> 1:03:30.495
until you finish
your horrible shi...

1:03:30.528 --> 1:03:31.996
Oh fuck...

1:04:36.427 --> 1:04:37.961
Hello?

1:04:39.029 --> 1:04:40.364
Wiggs?

1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:44.502
Go away, I'm in the zone.

1:04:53.010 --> 1:04:54.211
I can totally see you, man.

1:04:59.983 --> 1:05:01.985
What do you want,
a brown potato?

1:05:02.019 --> 1:05:03.588
I'll toss you one,
straight from the cooker,

1:05:03.621 --> 1:05:05.189
you know, I will.

1:05:18.435 --> 1:05:21.238
What, I gotta close the door
when I take a crap now?

1:05:21.271 --> 1:05:22.607
Stupid!

1:06:06.551 --> 1:06:08.285
Yo, O'Brian?

1:07:59.429 --> 1:08:01.566
Yo, O'Brian,
you here?!

1:09:49.239 --> 1:09:51.274
Hi, Spencer!

1:09:51.308 --> 1:09:53.343
Hey, do you wanna help?

1:09:53.377 --> 1:09:55.580
It's a lot of fun!

1:10:07.825 --> 1:10:08.860
Spencer?

1:10:08.893 --> 1:10:11.863
You want to help?

1:10:11.896 --> 1:10:15.365
Actually I'm leaving, Violet,
I just wanted to let...

1:10:15.399 --> 1:10:16.634
you know...

1:10:17.835 --> 1:10:19.436
Spencer?

1:12:13.383 --> 1:12:15.318
How long has that kid
been there?

1:12:15.352 --> 1:12:17.622
Which one?

1:12:17.655 --> 1:12:20.525
Do you mean the boy
with the skull mask?

1:12:20.558 --> 1:12:21.659
No, no, no...

1:12:21.692 --> 1:12:23.461
Who is that?

1:12:26.429 --> 1:12:27.532
Holy shit!

1:12:27.565 --> 1:12:29.634
Who is that?!

1:12:30.668 --> 1:12:32.435
You!

1:12:32.470 --> 1:12:34.437
Get back!

1:12:34.472 --> 1:12:35.405
Spencer!

1:12:35.438 --> 1:12:36.474
What are you doing?!

1:12:36.507 --> 1:12:39.376
I said get back!

1:12:39.409 --> 1:12:41.712
Back or I'll brain you!

1:12:41.746 --> 1:12:45.348
I know who you are!

1:12:48.953 --> 1:12:52.523
I'm Greg!

1:12:52.557 --> 1:12:54.592
It's Greg!

1:12:54.625 --> 1:12:56.093
Do you know, Greg?

1:12:56.127 --> 1:12:57.728
I didn't do anything I swear!

1:12:57.762 --> 1:12:59.429
Greg, you scared me!

1:13:01.766 --> 1:13:02.600
It's Halloween!

1:13:02.633 --> 1:13:04.769
Well take it down a notch,
okay Greg?

1:13:04.802 --> 1:13:05.703
Take it down!

1:13:05.736 --> 1:13:07.705
What is going on?!

1:13:07.738 --> 1:13:09.106
Spencer, where are you going?

1:13:09.140 --> 1:13:10.641
Spencer!?

1:13:10.675 --> 1:13:11.709
Spencer!?

1:13:32.697 --> 1:13:35.032
Oh my god, Jonesy.

1:13:35.066 --> 1:13:36.634
You fucking scared me, buddy!

1:13:36.667 --> 1:13:38.603
Yeah.

1:13:39.503 --> 1:13:40.838
Jesus.

1:14:11.969 --> 1:14:13.971
- Where were you?
- I was asleep, holy shit!

1:14:14.005 --> 1:14:15.640
- Holy shit.
- Where are you?!

1:14:15.673 --> 1:14:16.641
I don't know, I came to my room.

1:14:16.674 --> 1:14:18.876
I think I gotta call my mom.

1:14:18.910 --> 1:14:19.810
Have you seen them?

1:14:19.844 --> 1:14:21.178
No, but they're coming, fuck!

1:14:21.212 --> 1:14:22.647
What are we going to do?!

1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:24.482
Okay, remember what you said.

1:14:24.515 --> 1:14:25.316
If it was you,
you'd get in the car

1:14:25.349 --> 1:14:27.118
- and drive to Cleveland.
- Airport.

1:14:27.151 --> 1:14:28.519
- Even better.
- Let's do it.

1:14:28.552 --> 1:14:30.121
Visa, passport, cash,

1:14:30.154 --> 1:14:31.122
I'll meet you at the van
in 5 minutes.

1:14:31.155 --> 1:14:33.124
It's at the parking lot
behind Henry House.

1:14:33.157 --> 1:14:34.625
- 5 minutes.
- 5 minutes.

1:14:34.659 --> 1:14:36.627
Fuck!

1:16:55.467 --> 1:16:57.101
- I saw them!
- Me too!

1:16:57.134 --> 1:16:59.236
- Cleveland!
- Fuck, yes!

1:16:59.270 --> 1:17:01.605
- Wait!
- Fuck!

1:17:01.639 --> 1:17:03.274
- Is that one of them?!
- Run it over!

1:17:03.307 --> 1:17:04.975
- No, I can't just run it over!
- Run it over!

1:17:05.009 --> 1:17:06.777
- What if it isn't one of them?!
- Run it over!

1:17:56.727 --> 1:17:57.695
Oh, my god.

1:17:57.728 --> 1:17:58.729
Fuck.

1:18:01.265 --> 1:18:03.033
Okay, okay.

1:18:07.071 --> 1:18:09.373
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1:18:11.175 --> 1:18:12.376
There's no service!

1:18:19.416 --> 1:18:21.652
Spencer, Spencer!

1:18:23.087 --> 1:18:24.321
What the fuck are we gonna
do, what the fuck?!

1:18:26.790 --> 1:18:29.226
We need to get off campus!

1:18:29.260 --> 1:18:31.095
Spencer, Spencer!

1:18:31.128 --> 1:18:32.363
- Keep it down.
- Okay.

1:18:32.396 --> 1:18:34.765
I need you to keep it together,
okay?

1:18:34.798 --> 1:18:35.366
- Okay.
- Okay?

1:18:35.399 --> 1:18:37.935
Okay.

1:18:37.968 --> 1:18:39.837
Okay, I have one percent.

1:18:39.870 --> 1:18:40.905
Okay, where's your phone?
Where's your phone?

1:18:40.938 --> 1:18:41.839
It's in the van.

1:18:41.872 --> 1:18:43.140
Shit, what's in your backpack?

1:18:47.111 --> 1:18:48.179
- There's this.
- A charger.

1:18:48.212 --> 1:18:51.048
That's good, that's good.

1:18:51.081 --> 1:18:52.750
- And this.
- Duck camera.

1:18:52.783 --> 1:18:54.418
They're infra-red,
we could see in the dark.

1:18:54.451 --> 1:18:55.487
But it needs your phone.

1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:58.055
Okay,
we need to charge my phone ASAP,

1:18:58.088 --> 1:18:59.423
look for an outlet.

1:19:00.925 --> 1:19:03.060
- Hey.
- What?

1:19:03.093 --> 1:19:04.395
There's a door.

1:19:36.293 --> 1:19:38.095
Why the fuck is there no outlet.

1:19:42.833 --> 1:19:44.401
Shit, phone just died.

1:19:47.204 --> 1:19:49.406
Fumes.

1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:50.941
Awesome.

1:19:50.975 --> 1:19:52.176
Come on!

1:20:09.226 --> 1:20:12.229
Oh my god.

1:20:12.263 --> 1:20:13.998
The old hospital.

1:20:14.031 --> 1:20:15.432
Oh my god.

1:20:22.339 --> 1:20:24.408
- Fuck.
- Shit.

1:20:24.441 --> 1:20:26.377
It's dead.

1:20:26.410 --> 1:20:27.479
Let me try.

1:20:32.850 --> 1:20:34.519
It's the boy from the book!

1:20:37.921 --> 1:20:39.524
Come on, let's go!

1:20:46.430 --> 1:20:47.931
What are you doing?!

1:20:49.199 --> 1:20:50.267
Grace!

1:20:54.338 --> 1:20:55.573
Let's go!

1:20:58.342 --> 1:20:59.577
Grace, come on!

1:21:03.515 --> 1:21:05.082
He's beauti...

1:21:22.667 --> 1:21:23.367
Is it following us?

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:24.301
Where's the lighter?!

1:21:24.335 --> 1:21:25.969
- Where's the lighter?!
- I don't know!

1:21:26.003 --> 1:21:28.138
Okay, okay.

1:21:30.307 --> 1:21:32.510
Red glow!

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:50.628
An outlet!
Fuck!

1:21:53.130 --> 1:21:54.932
- Give me the charger!
- Okay.

1:22:14.017 --> 1:22:19.156
We're going to die down here.

1:22:19.189 --> 1:22:21.125
Then our audience
won't find out.

1:22:21.158 --> 1:22:22.926
Find out what.

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:23.961
Will they fuck?

1:22:28.533 --> 1:22:31.335
I've been here before.

1:22:31.368 --> 1:22:34.037
I was stoned here at frosh,
we played D&D down here.

1:22:34.071 --> 1:22:36.474
Hey, if we put a camera
on the end of this

1:22:36.508 --> 1:22:38.643
we could literally see
in the dark.

1:22:38.676 --> 1:22:41.345
And the light won't attract
those things.

1:23:13.611 --> 1:23:15.446
Do you know
who else paints birds,

1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:16.714
prisoners.

1:23:16.748 --> 1:23:19.349
It means they want to be free.

1:23:19.383 --> 1:23:20.451
Spencer, they bricked them up!

1:23:20.485 --> 1:23:22.119
The balloon babies
just want to be free?

1:23:22.152 --> 1:23:23.353
Yes!

1:23:23.387 --> 1:23:25.422
That's all they want, remember?

1:23:25.457 --> 1:23:28.125
That old guy, he said freeeee!
Freeee!

1:23:28.158 --> 1:23:30.227
I thought you were saying
that he said fleeee!

1:23:30.260 --> 1:23:34.599
We have to get to Zoe's room,
we have to free them!

1:23:34.632 --> 1:23:36.534
The HUB isn't far from here.

1:23:36.568 --> 1:23:39.236
And the stairs to Greyson
are right after that.

1:23:39.269 --> 1:23:40.437
Bring up the app for this.

1:23:40.472 --> 1:23:42.206
Okay.

1:23:46.478 --> 1:23:49.714
Holy shit, that is fucked.

1:23:55.118 --> 1:23:56.688
Okay, which way.

1:23:56.721 --> 1:23:58.121
That way.

1:24:32.155 --> 1:24:33.257
We're back in
the main tunnel system.

1:24:33.290 --> 1:24:34.424
Yeah.

1:24:34.459 --> 1:24:35.627
The Foundry tunnel
is straight ahead,

1:24:35.660 --> 1:24:38.395
and the stairs to Greyson
are right after.

1:25:06.891 --> 1:25:07.659
Fuck!

1:25:07.692 --> 1:25:09.594
Oh my god, oh my god!

1:25:11.529 --> 1:25:13.096
Listen!

1:25:22.607 --> 1:25:23.741
Fuck, what is that?!

1:25:23.775 --> 1:25:25.375
Someone's there.

1:25:28.913 --> 1:25:32.282
Pan the camera, pan it!

1:26:26.504 --> 1:26:28.205
Oh, my god.

1:26:28.238 --> 1:26:31.274
Okay, okay.

1:26:31.308 --> 1:26:32.175
Okay.

1:26:32.209 --> 1:26:33.811
Okay, I think
that's the door up there,

1:26:33.845 --> 1:26:35.880
- and over there...
- What is that?!

1:26:35.913 --> 1:26:38.382
What?

1:26:38.415 --> 1:26:39.617
What?!

1:26:39.651 --> 1:26:41.753
Rotate the stick!

1:26:41.786 --> 1:26:43.286
Rotate it!

1:26:44.956 --> 1:26:46.390
I thought I saw someth...

1:26:47.859 --> 1:26:50.360
Oh, my god.

1:26:56.901 --> 1:26:57.702
Spencer?!

1:26:57.735 --> 1:26:58.569
Spencer!

1:26:58.603 --> 1:26:59.637
Spencer!

1:27:02.607 --> 1:27:03.808
Fuck!

1:28:15.847 --> 1:28:16.681
You coming?

1:28:16.714 --> 1:28:17.982
Yeah...

1:28:18.015 --> 1:28:19.650
Ummm, you know, I'm just...
I'm going to be late.

1:28:19.684 --> 1:28:21.886
I just...
I have to do something first.

1:28:21.919 --> 1:28:23.353
Okay, see you there.

1:28:23.386 --> 1:28:24.589
Okay.

1:28:44.407 --> 1:28:45.877
Oh hello, Grace!

1:28:45.910 --> 1:28:48.813
Dr. MaCail, I just wanted
to return this to you.

1:28:48.846 --> 1:28:50.848
Oh goodness, thank you.

1:28:50.882 --> 1:28:52.583
Well, I hope
it did you some good.

1:28:52.617 --> 1:28:54.585
It did, thanks.

1:28:54.619 --> 1:28:56.386
I also wanted to let you know
that everything

1:28:56.419 --> 1:28:58.388
is going to be okay now.

1:28:58.421 --> 1:29:00.390
They're free.

1:29:00.423 --> 1:29:01.826
- I'm sorry?
- We released them.

1:29:01.859 --> 1:29:04.361
And I think that
they're at peace now.

1:29:04.394 --> 1:29:05.630
Released them?

1:29:05.663 --> 1:29:06.798
Yes.

1:29:06.831 --> 1:29:09.332
We took down the brick.

1:29:09.366 --> 1:29:11.068
- Are you mad?
- What.

1:29:11.102 --> 1:29:13.671
Why do you think
we bricked them in?!

1:29:13.704 --> 1:29:15.338
To protect us!

1:29:15.372 --> 1:29:17.041
To protect us all!

1:29:17.074 --> 1:29:19.544
Do you realize
what you've done?!

1:29:46.103 --> 1:29:47.805
Save yourself.

1:29:59.016 --> 1:30:00.985
No, no, no,
after the sea.

1:30:01.018 --> 1:30:02.553
No, no, that is ridiculous.

1:30:03.821 --> 1:30:05.089
She's my
favourite, she's my favourite.

1:30:05.122 --> 1:30:07.792
No, no.

1:30:14.431 --> 1:30:14.966
No, no!

1:30:14.999 --> 1:30:16.701
We have to go back!

1:30:16.734 --> 1:30:18.769
We have to go back
or we're all going to die!

1:30:18.803 --> 1:30:19.937
Please, listen to me,
listen to me,

1:30:19.971 --> 1:30:21.539
we have to land this plane,

1:30:21.572 --> 1:30:23.107
I know that I sound like
a crazy person

1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.576
but I can't sit down
because this thing, on here,

1:30:25.610 --> 1:30:27.879
is going to kill us all!

1:30:29.614 --> 1:30:30.447
Listen, we have to talk
to the pilot...

1:30:40.725 --> 1:30:43.060
I used to have nightmares,
them crawling inside me.

1:31:02.113 --> 1:31:03.547
Spiders! Spiders!

1:31:03.581 --> 1:31:05.415
Ugh!
They're crawling up my leg!
