WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.442
Oh, hey, Frasier.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.511
Oh, hello, Roz.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.346
Happy New Year.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.081
Or should I say,
happy new millennium.

00:15.081 --> 00:15.882
Oh, barf.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.284
I'm so sick of
talking about it.

00:18.284 --> 00:19.586
Oh, now, Roz, let's not condemn
the new millennium

00:20.086 --> 00:21.821
just because you woke up in it
with a hangover.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.425
That's what ruined church
for you.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.961
Decaf latte,
please.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.963
I just hate
how this arbitrary point

00:29.963 --> 00:31.931
on the calendar
has become so significant.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.300
And as far my hangover went,

00:34.300 --> 00:35.568
it was worth it.

00:35.568 --> 00:39.973
I partied my ass off like
a brain-damaged test monkey.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.241
I see.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.809
Well, allow me
to congratulate you

00:42.809 --> 00:44.811
on your first
science-related metaphor.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.646
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

00:46.646 --> 00:47.447
And what did you do?

00:47.881 --> 00:48.948
Get all freaky
and finish your list

00:48.948 --> 00:50.750
of the century's
greatest thinkers?

00:50.750 --> 00:52.585
No, but my new year's was
plenty exciting enough,

00:52.585 --> 00:53.920
thank you very much.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.224
Although... not exactly
in a way I'd planned.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.726
Cancel the millennium.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.995
Chez Henri
has burned down!

01:01.995 --> 01:03.263
Burned down?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.164
NILES:
Yes.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.666
Apparently, Henri
was caramelizing

01:06.666 --> 01:08.168
a huge creme brulee

01:08.168 --> 01:10.503
in the shape
of Puget Sound

01:10.503 --> 01:12.138
when a sugar spark

01:12.138 --> 01:15.942
ignited a 30-foot papier
mâche space needle.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.678
They're already calling it

01:18.678 --> 01:22.148
the worst centerpiece disaster
in the history of Seattle.

01:22.148 --> 01:26.019
Henri built his reputation
with that caramelizing torch.

01:26.019 --> 01:29.956
My God. The irony of him burning
down his own restaurant with it.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.325
It's worthy of O. Henry.

01:32.325 --> 01:36.096
O. Henri.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.965
Please, Niles,
it's too soon to joke.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.967
What exactly are we going
to do tomorrow night?

01:41.401 --> 01:42.469
Every restaurant in town

01:42.469 --> 01:44.404
worth going to
has been booked for months.

01:44.404 --> 01:45.305
Well, you know,
you can join me

01:45.305 --> 01:46.706
and the boys
at McGinty's.

01:46.706 --> 01:47.607
It's going to be a lot of fun.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.944
They're going to dye
the beer green.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.812
Why would you do that
on New Year's Eve?

01:52.812 --> 01:55.315
Oh, well, McGinty's going in
for a bypass next month,

01:55.315 --> 01:58.284
and he's afraid he might not
make it out for St. Patty's Day.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.687
This is a disaster.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.723
No, they'll just pop in
another pig valve.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.125
You know,
the only reason

02:05.125 --> 02:07.060
he needs it is 'cause
he eats so much bacon.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.061
So the same thing
that's killing him

02:08.561 --> 02:10.896
is keeping him alive.

02:10.896 --> 02:13.633
There's your
O. Henry story.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.003
Well, maybe we can just stay in
tomorrow night.

02:17.003 --> 02:20.006
On the most significant
New Year's Eve of our lifetime?

02:20.006 --> 02:21.007
I think not.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.009
I should have just gone with Mel.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.511
She and her
mother are taking

02:24.511 --> 02:25.478
a hot air balloon

02:25.478 --> 02:26.479
through the wine country.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.582
Well, not in the balloon, no,

02:29.582 --> 02:32.919
but I could've followed along
in the recovery vehicle.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.222
Wait a minute.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.491
Speaking of wine,

02:38.491 --> 02:41.227
wasn't the wine club having
some sort of a party?

02:41.227 --> 02:43.129
Yes, at Ken Lauterbach's
place in Sun Valley.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.097
Oh, it's a huge event.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.499
Of course!
"Auld Lang Wine"!

02:46.499 --> 02:48.368
Niles, call and see
if we're still invited.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.170
All right, I'm on it.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.538
Bloody hell.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.774
Five days
after Christmas is over,

02:54.774 --> 02:56.276
and I'm still getting
these cards.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.144
They do it on purpose,
you know.

02:58.144 --> 02:59.546
It's always from someone
you forgot,

02:59.546 --> 03:01.047
and then it's too late
to send one back.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.550
Then they sneer at you
for the rest of the year.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.419
"Peace and goodwill," my ass.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.556
You just lost yourself
a customer,

03:09.556 --> 03:11.057
Dr. Naran S. Gupta, D.D.S.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.392
MARTIN: Mm.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.726
Losing a set
of English teeth.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.962
He'll feel that.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.365
This is for you
from the D.M.V.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.367
Oh-ho! I know what this is.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.870
The custom plates I ordered for
my Winnebago.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.872
Yay!

03:25.872 --> 03:30.877
Well, 50 bucks,
but I think it says it all.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.880
Rrrd?

03:33.880 --> 03:36.883
Wrr...er?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.886
Rid... worry...er?

03:39.886 --> 03:40.887
Red wearer!

03:40.887 --> 03:44.824
Oh, for God's sake,
"Road Warrior."

03:44.824 --> 03:46.226
Of course.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.727
For a retired man with a cane
and a Winnebago.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.730
I don't know why my mind
didn't go straight to it.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.532
NILES:
Huzzah!

03:52.532 --> 03:53.833
Hello, Daphne.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.335
Ken says he'd love to have us come,

03:55.335 --> 03:56.836
and the more, the merrier.

03:56.836 --> 03:58.338
Oh, Niles,
that's brilliant.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.839
Dad, please, please,
won't you join us?

03:59.839 --> 04:01.140
You know what? Say,
let's call the travel agent.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.442
Not to rain on your parade,

04:02.442 --> 04:04.944
but you may have a tough time
getting flights this late.

04:04.944 --> 04:05.945
Donny and I had a devil
of a time

04:06.446 --> 04:07.947
getting our flight
to San Francisco.

04:07.947 --> 04:09.215
Oh, Daphne,

04:09.215 --> 04:10.550
they always set aside

04:10.550 --> 04:15.054
a few choice seats
for Seattle's travel elite.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.026
(horn honking)

04:20.026 --> 04:21.527
MAN:
Pick a lane, Road Warrior!

04:21.527 --> 04:22.428
MARTIN: See?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.329
He got it.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.331
Hey!

04:29.836 --> 04:32.905
MARTIN: Ah, being on the road
like this is like

04:32.905 --> 04:34.407
we're three
dusty hoboes

04:34.907 --> 04:38.745
sharing a boxcar
to parts unknown.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.181
Yes, well, if you don't take
this next turn,

04:42.181 --> 04:45.618
we'll end up in Californy.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.388
Gee, Niles,
you seem a little cranky.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.256
Well, perhaps that's because
I rousted out of a warm bed

04:50.256 --> 04:54.093
at the crack of dawn
and herded onto a Winnebago!

04:55.428 --> 04:56.796
Better safe
than sorry, Niles.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.798
You know, it's 650 miles
to Sun Valley,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.301
and half of that's
through the mountains.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.802
By the way,

05:02.802 --> 05:04.804
how are we going to explain
to the wine club

05:04.804 --> 05:06.806
our arriving
in a Winnebago?

05:06.806 --> 05:08.808
Just chalk it 
off to whimsy, Niles.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.078
We'll call it 
our "Van Ordinaire."

05:13.346 --> 05:15.348
You know, besides,
I'm actually enjoying

05:15.348 --> 05:17.150
this little trip
through the heartland.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.419
I feel a little bit out of touch
with the common man.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.187
It's nice to reconnect.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.457
Well, while you're
reconnecting,

05:24.457 --> 05:26.359
why don't
you let me drive?

05:28.194 --> 05:29.595
I-I would, Niles.

05:29.595 --> 05:30.596
It's just that, um...

05:30.596 --> 05:32.598
I ne... I need
you to navigate.

05:32.598 --> 05:36.836
Yeah, you're the most important
member of our crew, good buddy.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.640
The man with
the map.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.141
Stop patronizing me.
I want to drive.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.645
Oh, you're not good
with big cars, Niles.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.647
Remember when I tried to teach
you to drive my Le Sabre?

05:47.647 --> 05:51.551
You kept panicking and pulling
on the emergency break.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.919
Well, it's
a good thing I did.

05:52.919 --> 05:56.322
Those mailboxes weren't
even slowing me down.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.725
Oh, did you see
that sign?

05:58.725 --> 06:01.194
Little Red Cabin.
Remember those diners?

06:01.194 --> 06:05.164
Home of the logroller:
a flank steak wrapped

06:05.164 --> 06:09.068
around a combination of eggs,
cheese and onions.

06:09.068 --> 06:11.771
You kids used to love
eating there.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.539
You'd scream out at me,
"Dad, pull over!

06:14.073 --> 06:16.476
Quick, pull over!"

06:16.476 --> 06:19.412
Actually, Dad, that was after we ate.

06:23.182 --> 06:27.186
(humming to classical music)

06:29.689 --> 06:31.691
Oh, Niles.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.192
Thought you
were sleeping.

06:33.192 --> 06:36.696
(Martin laughing)

06:36.696 --> 06:38.698
I was trying to,

06:38.698 --> 06:40.533
but Dad wanted
to watch the VCR.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.901
Oh, good Lord.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.704
Not Robin
and the Seven Hoods again?

06:44.704 --> 06:46.939
(Martin laughing)

06:46.939 --> 06:48.441
Worse.

06:48.441 --> 06:49.809
(à la Austin Powers):
Yeah, baby.

06:49.809 --> 06:52.345
Now, that was
a shagadelic flick.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.848
You know, Dad,
if you're quite done,

06:55.848 --> 06:57.350
I think I'll try
to take a nap.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.852
Oh, behave.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.725
You know, Dad,

07:05.725 --> 07:07.493
you do realize that
the Austin Powers craze

07:08.060 --> 07:08.561
is completely over.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.863
Well, I'm sorry.
Do I bore you?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.165
Or do I make you randy?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.600
FRASIER:
Oh...

07:14.600 --> 07:16.536
(phone ringing)

07:19.038 --> 07:21.507
Hello.

07:21.507 --> 07:24.377
Yes, Niles.

07:25.711 --> 07:30.149
I'm driving as
smoothly as I can.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.717
Any other little
driving tips

07:31.717 --> 07:33.152
you'd like
to give me?

07:33.152 --> 07:36.722
Why don't you just come up here
and tell me to my face!

07:36.722 --> 07:38.057
Hey, look,

07:38.057 --> 07:39.859
another
Little Red Cabin sign.

07:39.859 --> 07:40.860
You know, we're not going
to find anything

07:40.860 --> 07:42.361
better to eat
on this highway.

07:42.361 --> 07:43.830
Oh, let's no
t be hasty, Dad.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.298
It's five miles away.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.767
We might run over something
before then.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.972
You know,
I am so tired,

07:52.972 --> 07:54.974
I can barely read
this menu.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.476
That's all right,
Niles,

07:56.476 --> 07:57.443
you don't have
to read.

07:57.443 --> 07:58.411
You can just point to a picture

07:58.411 --> 08:00.913
of the food you want.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.248
MARTIN:
What's this?

08:02.248 --> 08:04.050
"A logroller
with your choice of cheese"?

08:04.584 --> 08:07.453
You can't have a logroller
without American cheese.

08:07.453 --> 08:08.821
Apparently, you
can't get anything in this restaurant

08:08.821 --> 08:12.625
without American cheese... including the menu.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.460
Niles, if you're
so tired,

08:14.460 --> 08:16.963
why don't you go back to the Road
Warrior, take a nap?

08:16.963 --> 08:19.966
Oh, you know,
that's a good idea.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.968
At least it'll be quiet.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.937
I wonder if you can still get
sticky shingles here.

08:24.937 --> 08:28.708
One look at the salad bar
says yes.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.977
What looks good to you, Fras?

08:30.977 --> 08:31.844
Well, actually, Dad,

08:32.345 --> 08:37.250
you know, I think
I'll have a hamburger.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.653
Would you order that
for me, Dad?

08:40.653 --> 08:42.020
Yeah. You going someplace?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.489
FRASIER:
As a matter of fact, I am.

08:43.489 --> 08:46.425
I'm going to take a chance
and reacquaint myself

08:46.425 --> 08:50.429
with an old friend of mine:
America.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.437
Hello there.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.542
Could I buy you
a cup of coffee?

09:02.542 --> 09:06.579
You see, I'm just
a wandering city mouse

09:06.579 --> 09:09.615
trying to get in touch
with America.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.118
Now, you, you look
like you'd be a farmer.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.120
Oh, I get it.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.621
You see a guy
in a rural diner

09:15.621 --> 09:17.123
wearing shab
by clothes,

09:17.123 --> 09:18.991
you pin your little label on him.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.326
Well, guess what?

09:20.326 --> 09:21.827
I am a farmer,

09:21.827 --> 09:23.829
but I'm also
a beautiful,

09:24.330 --> 09:26.299
flawed, complicated human being,

09:26.299 --> 09:28.568
and it's going to take
more than a cup of coffee

09:28.568 --> 09:29.769
to get inside here.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.574
I'll just go see
how my father's doing.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.110
So, how was he?

09:38.110 --> 09:40.413
Beautiful, flawed...

09:40.413 --> 09:41.447
unpleasant.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.383
Well, according to the map,

09:44.383 --> 09:46.152
it's about 300 miles
to Sun Valley.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.420
Oh, that's delightful, Dad.
You know what?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.788
We'll get there
in plenty of time for the party.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.656
Hey, listen, you know, your brother's
going to be hungry.

09:50.656 --> 09:51.657
Maybe we should
bring him a sandwich.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.658
I wouldn't worry
about Niles, Dad.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.160
You saw how tired
he was.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.661
Let's just let him sleep
for the rest of the trip.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.430
You sure?
Oh, sure.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.198
It's the most exciting day
of the year, Dad.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.633
For God's sakes, you know,

10:00.633 --> 10:02.568
when Niles wakes up,
I guarantee you

10:02.568 --> 10:03.569
the last thing
he'd be thinking about

10:03.569 --> 10:07.039
is sandwiches.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.748
WOMAN:
Oh, my goodness.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.250
Look what I just found
in my pocket.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.251
The lighter I borrowed

10:19.251 --> 10:20.753
from that waitress
in the restaurant.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.254
I feel terrible.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.756
Forget it, Mother.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.058
We're not
taking it back.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.896
MOTHER: Well, I really think
we should just turn around

10:30.896 --> 10:33.399
an-and say we're sorry
and return it.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.401
MAN:
I think we ought to keep it.

10:35.401 --> 10:38.404
Our old one's
nearly out of fuel anyway.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.872
MOTHER:
That doesn't make it right.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.841
We're still criminals
in the eyes of the law.

10:43.876 --> 10:44.877
MAN:
There's a lot worse criminals

10:45.378 --> 10:46.312
than you and me.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.081
Remember that last
gun show we went to?

10:49.081 --> 10:49.882
We must have seen

10:49.882 --> 10:51.384
at least three
different people

10:51.384 --> 10:52.885
swiping boxes
of shells.

10:52.885 --> 10:54.387
There's one thing
you can say for us:

10:54.887 --> 10:58.224
We pay for our ammo.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.431
So, this party tonight--

11:05.898 --> 11:10.369
going to be a lot
of shagnificent birds?

11:11.303 --> 11:14.306
Dad, I'm begging you.

11:14.306 --> 11:18.244
(phone ringing)

11:19.145 --> 11:20.646
Hello.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.649
Niles, will you please stop
doing this?!

11:25.985 --> 11:28.154
I'm getting 
a little drowsy.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.021
Well, if you're so tired,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.790
just scootch over--
I'll take the wheel.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.324
MAN: Okay.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.100
Yes, yes, hello.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.601
I'm being kidnapped.
This is an emergency.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.103
I'm being kidnapped.

11:44.103 --> 11:48.107
I'm in a stolen Winnebago
heading east on I-84.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.110
I can't talk any louder.
I'm being stolen.

11:51.110 --> 11:57.116
Yes, yes. Washington plates--
R-D-W-R-E-R.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.118
Road Warrior.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.619
Yes, it does.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.122
It does so. Sound it out.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.625
Never mind. Oh, for God's sake,
just save me.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.628
MAN:
Oh, I'm... I'm getting too sleepy.

12:09.628 --> 12:11.630
I'm going back
for a little lie down.

12:11.630 --> 12:12.531
Okay.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.835
Oh, wait, Dad, look!

12:15.835 --> 12:18.037
There's another one of
those Little Red Cabins.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.139
Why don't we just stop
and have some supper first?

12:20.139 --> 12:22.842
'Cause I'm tired,
and I'm not hungry.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.243
Clifford.

12:25.678 --> 12:29.115
Well, I guess a sandwich
wouldn't kill me.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.788
MOTHER: I feel sort of funny
even stopping here.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.789
Sort of like
returning

12:36.789 --> 12:38.190
to the scene of the crime.

12:38.190 --> 12:41.627
Mother, let it go.

12:44.597 --> 12:49.502
(doors opening and closing)

12:51.000 --> 12:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:09.021 --> 13:10.990
(engine starts)

13:23.736 --> 13:25.638
All right, Eddie.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.642
Let's go sign
nature's guest book.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.846
(phone ringing)

13:33.846 --> 13:34.847
Hello.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.348
NILES:
Frasier?

13:36.348 --> 13:37.349
Yes.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.651
Niles.

13:38.651 --> 13:43.856
Put your fears to rest.
I've got Dad's Winnebago back.

13:43.856 --> 13:47.193
Niles, what on earth
are you talking about?

13:47.193 --> 13:48.194
You must have had a nightmare.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.162
Uh, indeed I have.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.164
But it's over now,
and I managed to give the thugs

13:52.164 --> 13:54.934
a taste of their own
thieving medicine.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.204
(gasps):
Niles!

13:58.204 --> 14:00.172
Niles, where are
you calling from?!

14:00.172 --> 14:03.075
From behind the wheel
of the Road Warrior.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.913
And doing a damn fine job
driving, I might add.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.349
But I'm in the Road Warrior!

14:10.349 --> 14:11.817
You got in the wrong car,
you idiot!

14:11.817 --> 14:14.820
You've stolen a Winnebago!

14:14.820 --> 14:16.822
Oh, don't be absurd.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.827
Oh.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.531
Oh.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.867
Oh, my God!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.568
(tires squealing)

14:33.472 --> 14:35.441
(tires screeching)

14:35.441 --> 14:36.876
All right, Niles,
just keep your head!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.377
There's no need to panic!

14:38.377 --> 14:40.379
MAN (over bullhorn):
This is the police!

14:40.379 --> 14:41.881
Exit your vehicle
immediately

14:42.381 --> 14:46.352
with your hands
above your head.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.971
How's that turkey club, Dad?

15:05.971 --> 15:08.707
A little dry.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.888
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.291
These papers
all check out, sir. Well,

15:25.291 --> 15:26.692
if there's nothing
else, we're in a hurry

15:26.692 --> 15:27.960
to get to Sun Valley.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.696
But not too much
of a hurry.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.197
Well, drive safely.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.999
FRASIER:
Thank you.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.334
What a clown.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.835
I can tell you
ten things he did wrong

15:36.835 --> 15:38.203
right off the bat.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.972
Well, at least
he was apologetic.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.840
Oh, these hick towns will give any bozo a badge.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.342
A goober like that wouldn't last

15:43.342 --> 15:46.845
ten minutes in a
real police force...

15:47.846 --> 15:51.650
...without getting a promotion.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.320
Your license.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.822
(chuckles)

15:56.822 --> 15:58.657
(phone ringing)

16:01.493 --> 16:02.995
Hello.

16:02.995 --> 16:03.996
Hello, Frasier.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.497
I've managed to solve
the problem.

16:05.497 --> 16:06.498
I returned the Winnebago.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.000
To where? Where are you?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.436
Well, I'm in Baker City, Oregon.

16:10.436 --> 16:11.370
Baker City?!

16:11.370 --> 16:14.373
Shag me rotten.
That's 300 miles!

16:15.374 --> 16:17.876
Niles, we will never get there

16:17.876 --> 16:20.245
and then back to Sun Valley
before midnight.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.114
Well, I'm not going
to ring in the new year

16:22.114 --> 16:23.582
in a Little Red Cabin.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.584
All right, all right. Listen.

16:25.584 --> 16:27.086
The only way we can ever pull this off

16:27.586 --> 16:29.088
is if you can catch a
ride in this direction.

16:29.588 --> 16:30.990
Hold on. Hold on.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.394
Oh, my gosh.
It's engraved.

16:35.394 --> 16:37.896
Dad, I'm not going to enjoy
the rest of this trip

16:37.896 --> 16:40.766
until we return
that woman's lighter.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.134
Mother, do you expect me
to turn around

16:42.134 --> 16:44.636
and drive 150 miles back

16:45.137 --> 16:46.138
to that Little Red Cabin?

16:46.138 --> 16:48.140
We are not going.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.642
End of discussion.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.011
Clifford.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.184
Good news. I'm on my way.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.520
All right, Niles says he can make it back

17:01.520 --> 17:03.022
to the restaurant where we first got separated.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.523
All I have to do now is
turn this boat around.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.925
30 miles
to the next exit.

17:07.925 --> 17:09.294
I can't wait that long.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.195
Well, you can't do a U-ey
on an interstate.

17:11.195 --> 17:13.098
That's 20th-century talk, Dad.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.599
Welcome to the future!

17:15.067 --> 17:15.968
(tires screeching)

17:27.179 --> 17:28.981
God, that felt great!

17:28.981 --> 17:30.482
Wow! This is really
quite an adventure,

17:30.482 --> 17:31.483
isn't it, Dad?

17:31.950 --> 17:34.420
(siren blaring)

17:34.420 --> 17:36.321
MARTIN:
It is now.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.357
Oh, dear God.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.659
MARTIN:
All right, just relax, Frasier.

17:40.659 --> 17:41.427
Now, I know cops.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.428
Just let me do
the talking.

17:42.428 --> 17:43.829
We'll be out of here
in two minutes.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.165
All right, Dad, let's switch.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.542
Well, look who's here.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.544
You boys know what you
did wrong back there?

17:58.544 --> 18:00.546
Yeah, yeah, I know.
A U-turn.

18:00.546 --> 18:04.550
Nope. Called
me a goober.

18:10.789 --> 18:14.359
(utensils clattering)

18:16.295 --> 18:18.363
Oh, Niles,

18:18.363 --> 18:20.232
I'm so sorry
we're late.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.600
Well, well, not to worry.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.469
When you're here
at the crossroads of the world,

18:23.469 --> 18:25.337
you have the human drama
to amuse you.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.340
(sighs):
Well, Happy New Year, boys.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.709
Oh, yes, five minutes ago.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.078
Everyone in the world will have
a wonderful story to tell

18:33.078 --> 18:34.546
about where they were
and what they were doing

18:34.546 --> 18:36.849
when the millennium dawned.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.384
What is our story?

18:39.384 --> 18:41.687
Speeding along a lonely highway.

18:41.687 --> 18:44.556
And you here, doing nothing.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.891
Well, not exactly nothing.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.926
Big Sandy let me watch
the register

18:47.926 --> 18:50.262
while she emptied the rat traps.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.834
Hey, wait a minute.

18:55.834 --> 18:56.835
Where are we?

18:56.835 --> 18:58.337
Well, Dad, I've
never seen a picture

18:58.337 --> 18:59.304
of the official middle
of nowhere, but...

18:59.805 --> 19:01.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 
but the middle of nowhere

19:01.340 --> 19:02.841
Mountain Time, right?

19:02.841 --> 19:06.178
It's still only
11:05, Pacific Time.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.980
Which can't be more
than 45 minutes from here.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.947
Right. We can cross the line

19:09.448 --> 19:09.948
and toast in the
new year together!

19:09.948 --> 19:11.650
Dad, that's brilliant!

19:11.650 --> 19:12.718
And there was a delightful-
looking little restaurant

19:13.218 --> 19:14.219
just across the border.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.721
MARTIN: Well, the guidebook said
it was pretentious.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.222
FRASIER:
Perfect! Let's roll!

19:18.223 --> 19:19.758
We're running
out of time!

19:19.758 --> 19:20.792
Well, I'm doing my best, Frasier,

19:20.792 --> 19:22.794
but we seem to
be losing power.

19:22.794 --> 19:23.795
(engine sputtering)

19:23.795 --> 19:24.796
What is that noise?

19:24.796 --> 19:26.198
What's wrong
with the engine?

19:26.198 --> 19:28.500
I didn't touch the
emergency brake.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.203
When was the last time
you put gas in this thing?

19:31.203 --> 19:32.504
Me? I don't even know
where the thing is

19:32.504 --> 19:34.940
to put the gas into.
MARTIN: Oh, no.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.375
I'm sorry, boys. It's dying.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.144
I'm going to be lucky
to get this off the road.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.247
I can't stand this!

19:42.247 --> 19:43.582
Have we so offended
the millennium gods

19:43.582 --> 19:46.051
that they will do anything
to ruin this evening?

19:46.051 --> 19:47.519
Burn down our restaurant?!

19:48.053 --> 19:51.557
Hurl vindictive lawmen
and duplicate Winnebagos

19:51.557 --> 19:53.959
in our path
to confound us?!

19:53.959 --> 19:55.360
Wait, is that a sign?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.328
Of course it's a sign!

19:56.328 --> 19:57.829
It's a sign
that we're cursed!

19:57.829 --> 20:00.132
No, no, no, it is!
It's a sign!

20:00.132 --> 20:01.400
We're entering
Pacific Time Zone!

20:01.867 --> 20:02.701
FRASIER:
Oh, my God!

20:02.701 --> 20:04.002
We're here!

20:04.002 --> 20:07.005
We made it!
We made it, oh!

20:07.005 --> 20:09.508
Come on, Eddie.
Oh, 30 seconds to spare!

20:10.008 --> 20:10.809
All right.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.144
We're rolling!

20:12.144 --> 20:14.146
We're rolling backwards!
Oh, no!

20:14.146 --> 20:16.348
No need to
panic, Frasier!

20:16.348 --> 20:18.850
(laughs)

20:19.851 --> 20:22.854
We rolled
back into Idaho!

20:22.854 --> 20:25.090
Follow me!

20:26.391 --> 20:27.392
Ten seconds.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.895
Let's look alive!

20:29.895 --> 20:31.330
Damn this foil.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.264
You can do it, Fras.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.166
Relax and focus.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.068
Three, two, one...

20:36.068 --> 20:38.070
(cork pops)
(laughs)

20:38.070 --> 20:40.505
A-ha! We made it!
Happy New Year!

20:40.505 --> 20:42.441
Happy New Year!

20:42.441 --> 20:43.442
There we are.

20:43.442 --> 20:44.943
Well, if you ask me...

20:44.943 --> 20:47.246
this beats
a dull party. Dad.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.383
Family, and good champagne,
and a blanket of stars.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.684
Hear, hear!

20:52.684 --> 20:54.186
Ah.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.190
You know what?

20:58.690 --> 21:00.993
I think this
calls for a song.

21:00.993 --> 21:06.098
♪♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪♪

21:06.098 --> 21:11.370
