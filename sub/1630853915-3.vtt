Meghan Trainor!

00:58.525 --> 01:00.093
[cheers and applause]
- Hi!

01:00.126 --> 01:02.629
What?

01:02.662 --> 01:04.064
Hello!
- Come on!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.199
- Hi!
- Meghan, you look great.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.400
It's giving
"Legally Blonde," girl.

01:07.434 --> 01:10.370
- [laughs]
- Yes, you look so good.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.072
- You look so cute.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.374
- Oh, my gosh,
thank you both for being here.

01:14.407 --> 01:16.710
And I know you made
some friends backstage,

01:16.743 --> 01:18.912
so, Jimmy, introduce me to who
you're playing with tonight.

01:18.945 --> 01:22.215
- Everyone, this is Dominic
from Peoria, Illinois.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.951
- Oh, Illinois, U.S.
- Illinois.

01:24.984 --> 01:28.188
Some fun facts--Dominic's
about to be a first-time dad.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.923
[cheers and applause]

01:29.956 --> 01:31.524
I'm excited for you,
and I know

01:31.558 --> 01:34.294
that you want
to take her sailing.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.229
- Yeah, so one
of my favorite things to do

01:36.262 --> 01:38.398
when I was little--my grandpa
was actually a ship captain,

01:38.431 --> 01:39.899
and he
owned multiple boats.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.868
And so being able to go out
on the water was a lot of fun.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.703
And I remember
there's a little picture of me

01:43.737 --> 01:45.171
when I was a little boy
with a Cardinal hat,

01:45.205 --> 01:47.340
a little floaty thing,
and life vest,

01:47.374 --> 01:48.875
and I can't wait
to re-create that with her.

01:48.908 --> 01:49.876
So I'm super excited.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.311
- Oh, my gosh,
so first one,

01:51.344 --> 01:53.013
and it's a girl.
- Yes.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.614
- You're going to love it.
- Oh, yeah, I'm super excited.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.016
- It's the greatest thing.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.517
- You starting out
with a good partner

01:57.550 --> 01:59.185
and you also
are a great partner, Meghan.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.721
I'm really excited to meet who
you're playing with tonight.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.857
- Tonight
I'm playing with Daryl

02:03.890 --> 02:06.393
from Corpus Christi, Texas.
- Corpus Christi.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.628
[cheers and applause]

02:08.661 --> 02:10.063
- This part's adorable.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.798
She grew up watching "Password"
with her grandma...

02:11.831 --> 02:13.066
- I did.
- [gasps]

02:13.099 --> 02:14.300
- Who's, like,
in her 90s, right?

02:14.334 --> 02:16.436
- She turns 90 this year.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.904
- Grandma's still hanging out!
- Yeah!

02:17.937 --> 02:19.673
- Yes, Grandma.
What's up, Grandma?

02:19.706 --> 02:21.141
- Hi, Grandma!
- Hi, Grandma!

02:21.174 --> 02:22.609
- Hi, Grandma!

02:22.642 --> 02:23.843
- Look at what's happening.
I love it.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.311
- Yeah, she's awesome.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.746
She's one of those people
that I've always looked up to.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.448
She's very independent,

02:28.481 --> 02:30.450
and we always watched
"Password" growing up.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.819
- Oh, my gosh.
- So she's gonna love this.

02:32.852 --> 02:33.953
- I'm so excited for you.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.355
We're all excited to be here

02:35.388 --> 02:38.358
because we're about to play...

02:38.391 --> 02:40.193
all: "Password"!

02:40.226 --> 02:42.495
[cheers and applause]

02:42.529 --> 02:43.963
- We got this, Meghan.
- Oh, my God.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.331
- I'm so excited.
- The rules are simple.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.167
I'll hand two of you
a password,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.735
and then you'll give
a one-word clue,

02:48.768 --> 02:50.470
one single-word clue

02:50.503 --> 02:52.472
to get your partner
to guess the password.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.107
The password is worth 6 points

02:54.140 --> 02:55.775
if you can get it right
on the first clue,

02:55.809 --> 02:59.012
then 5 points on the second
clue, and so on and so on.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.549
The first team to 15 points
wins game one

03:02.582 --> 03:04.484
in this "best out of three"
battle.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.252
[cheers and applause]

03:06.286 --> 03:08.621
Now, Meghan, is this is your
first time playing "Password"?

03:08.655 --> 03:10.924
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, you know what?

03:10.957 --> 03:12.826
You get a leg up, because
Jimmy's going to go first.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.627
Do you want to pass,
or do you want to play?

03:14.661 --> 03:17.731

He's going to play.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.216

Welcome to the game.
Welcome to the game.

Come on, Meghan!

"Password"!

03:42.589 --> 03:45.091

the crowd is hyped up!

03:45.091 --> 03:47.093
- That's the way we do it!
- Come on, bud!

03:47.093 --> 03:49.729
- Okay, welcome back.
- This is for you, Daryl.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.730

03:50.764 --> 03:51.998
- Dominic.
- Thank you, Keke.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.967
- All right, Dominic,
you guys are in the lead.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.103
That means, Daryl, it's up
to you because you're trailing.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.438
Do you want to play,
or do you want to pass?

03:58.471 --> 04:01.574

<i>The password is "gossip."</i>

- I'm going to play.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.679

she's going to play.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.113

04:07.147 --> 04:08.448
Wow, look at this.

04:08.481 --> 04:09.582
She's in the zone.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.651
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.319
- Rumors.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.256
[laughter]

04:16.289 --> 04:17.924
- You said "rumors."

04:19.426 --> 04:21.428
Lies.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.962
- That's not the password.
We're still in it.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.631
We're moving right
along to you, Dominic.

04:24.664 --> 04:28.435
The first clue was rumors.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.603
- [sassily] Girl.

04:30.637 --> 04:34.574
[laughter]

04:34.607 --> 04:36.076
- Gossip.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.577

Let's go!

- Let's go!
- It's not fair!

04:46.086 --> 04:48.655
It's my first time!
- My moves are getting better.

04:48.688 --> 04:49.956
- That was really good.
- Unbelievable.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.224
- That was really good.
- It worked, Dominic.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.526
- Jimmy tapped right in,
but guess what, Meghan.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.662
They got 11,
but it's the first to 15.

04:55.695 --> 04:56.996
I've seen some comebacks.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.164
- Yep.
- Okay.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.499
- Stay in it,
and you get to go first

04:59.532 --> 05:00.767
if you want to, Meghan.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.136

She's going to play.

Wet. Moist?

- Oh, my--look!

05:40.373 --> 05:41.775
- You see what I'm saying?
- The beast has come out

05:41.808 --> 05:43.209
of Meghan Trainor--
she's, like, going nuts!

05:43.243 --> 05:45.512
- Exactly, she tapped into
her inner Reese Witherspoon.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.846
She's giving us
"Legally Blonde."

05:46.880 --> 05:48.081
- Wow!
- You came in.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.382
How you feeling, Meghan?
You feeling good now?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.684
- I feel so good!
My heart's pounding!

05:50.717 --> 05:51.985
- I mean,
look at Meghan's clue!

05:52.085 --> 05:53.987
It's bent in pieces!

05:54.087 --> 05:56.089

- That was good.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.861

06:04.164 --> 06:05.799
- Whoo!
- We got 11.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.101
First to 15

06:08.134 --> 06:09.169
I'm going to you, Daryl,

06:09.202 --> 06:10.637
because you guys
are still trailing.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.739

you want to pass, girlfriend?

- Now, Dominic,

06:25.418 --> 06:28.088
this is for the game.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.890
- Dining.

- Crystal.

- China?

06:54.814 --> 06:55.882
What?

that's not the password.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.451
We're coming back to you,
Dominic.

06:58.485 --> 06:59.619
Every guess is a good guess.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.589
This would put you
in the winning seat.

- Talk to me.
- Hanging.

That's exactly right!
Come on!

- Let's go!
- Let's go!

07:24.244 --> 07:26.212
- Nobody said Sia,
but I wanted Sia to be said.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.414
- Ooh, that's a good one,
that's a good one.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.581
- That's the end
of the first round.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.051
- Sia.
- Where Dominic has a 1-0 lead.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.486
When we return, we'll switch up
the teams and play game two.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.890
Stick around--we'll be
right with more "Password."

Jimmy Fallon

07:58.712 --> 08:00.714
Dominic won the first game,
but remember,

08:00.747 --> 08:02.215
you have to win two games

08:02.248 --> 08:03.817
in our "best out of three"
showdown

08:03.850 --> 08:05.552
to move on to the bonus round.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.921
So, Daryl, we want,
of course, a tiebreaker.

I believe in you.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.225

made you say "manscaping"?

13:45.759 --> 13:46.960
I'm impressed with it.

Dominic, this is exciting, man.

What would you do
if you win 25 grand?

17:28.181 --> 17:29.949
- As you all know,
I am going to be a new father.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.451

have to worry about it.

you're a first-time mom.

You got any advice for Dominic?
- Sleep when she sleeps.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.959
- [laughs]
Yeah.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.062
- I didn't do it because I was
just too excited about life.

Sleep. Just sleep.
- Yeah.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.364

you sleep, but right now

both: Let's go.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.073
- All right.

to give you ten passwords

17:59.312 --> 18:01.247
Now, for every answer
that you get,

18:01.281 --> 18:02.449
you'll get a grand.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.317
But if you sweep the board
and get all ten,

18:04.351 --> 18:06.119

do you want to play with?

we're making them feel

23:12.692 --> 23:14.594
as if their disabilities
put their abilities

23:14.627 --> 23:15.695
to do what
they want in life.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.430
- Absolutely.
- Wow.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.065
- Thank you, thank you.
- I love to hear it, my man,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.768
because my mother actually
was a teacher for students

23:21.801 --> 23:22.869
with special needs.
- Wow.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.237

what you do.

I'm excited to meet

23:27.340 --> 23:28.808

- Yorba Linda!

23:34.381 --> 23:35.982
I know Yorba Linda!

a Harry Potter tattoo, Narnia,

23:47.460 --> 23:49.095

Little Francis.

23:49.129 --> 23:50.830

Seagull"?

23:50.864 --> 23:52.198
- I know, that's so weird,

23:52.232 --> 23:53.800
but that's my favorite book
as a kid.

- I love that.
- I need to read more.

23:55.468 --> 23:56.903

Yeah, that's a great one.

38:41.554 --> 38:44.958
Only Se Young can pass.
On your marks, get set...

38:45.058 --> 38:45.959
go.

38:46.059 --> 38:46.960

38:47.060 --> 38:48.361

38:48.395 --> 38:49.696
- Comforter.

38:49.729 --> 38:50.697

<i>[buzzer sounds]</i>

39:17.857 --> 39:19.292
[cheers and applause]

39:19.325 --> 39:20.527
- Se Young, that was great.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.795
You know, you broke a rule

39:21.828 --> 39:24.064
when you said "TV show"
because that's--

39:24.097 --> 39:25.732
you know, essentially
two words--it's an acronym.

39:25.765 --> 39:28.168
So we're going to take out
that word that was originally

39:28.201 --> 39:30.503
"cartoon" and put a new word in
for that letter.

39:30.537 --> 39:32.038
So it's no problem,
you're going to get a chance

39:32.038 --> 39:34.374
to get it again
and get the 25 grand.

39:34.407 --> 39:37.310
But you did good,
you got 5 for $5,000.

39:37.344 --> 39:38.812
That's yours regardless.

39:38.845 --> 39:42.615
But, of course, we want
to get you to the 25 grand.

39:42.649 --> 39:45.051
So Meghan's going
to come in and help you get

39:45.051 --> 39:47.554
to the end of those
remaining passwords, okay?

39:47.587 --> 39:49.589
- You got it.
- Let's do it!

39:49.622 --> 39:51.057
- You guys
are gonna do it together.

39:51.091 --> 39:53.626
Okay, the remaining passwords
are five.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.795
You got H, I, J,
then you're going to go

39:55.829 --> 39:57.731
back and get B and C.
- Mm-hmm.

39:57.764 --> 39:59.299
- 30 seconds again.

39:59.332 --> 40:02.469
And that's 30 seconds
away from a $25,000 payday.

40:02.502 --> 40:04.037
- Ooh, girl.

40:04.070 --> 40:07.140
On your marks, get set, go.

- January.

40:19.953 --> 40:21.488

40:30.964 --> 40:32.065
Pass, pass.

40:34.067 --> 40:35.201
- [groans]

40:35.235 --> 40:37.070
- Oh, my God, pass.

40:37.103 --> 40:39.606
- No, I'm sorry!
Key?

40:39.639 --> 40:42.142
- Oh, my goodness.
You got seven correct.

40:42.175 --> 40:43.443
- That's good.

40:43.476 --> 40:46.246
- That's a total of $7,000.

40:46.279 --> 40:48.248
But, obviously,
over here at "Password,"

40:48.281 --> 40:49.616
we want to try to get you more.

40:49.649 --> 40:51.317
We want to help you
double your winnings,

40:51.351 --> 40:54.754
so we're going to get
you into a redemption round.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.389
Okay?

40:56.423 --> 40:57.490
All right, you feel good?

40:57.524 --> 40:58.658
- Yes.
- You ready?

40:58.692 --> 40:59.959
- Yes.

41:00.060 --> 41:02.395
- The password
is coming up right here.

[laughter]

41:06.833 --> 41:09.402
- Se Young, what is the clue?

41:09.436 --> 41:11.304
- Brunch.

41:11.338 --> 41:14.941
- Okay,
here are the headphones.

41:14.974 --> 41:16.343
Turn your back.

41:16.376 --> 41:18.111
30 seconds on the clock.

41:18.144 --> 41:19.479
Jimmy and Meghan, go.

41:19.512 --> 41:21.314
- She said "brunch"
and then kind of went like...

41:21.348 --> 41:22.916
- Brunch?
- Like--

41:22.949 --> 41:24.451
She's off to, lunch.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.852
- Off to lunch, that's
what I was thinking, right?

41:25.885 --> 41:27.087
- Has to be "lunch," right?

41:27.087 --> 41:28.488
$14,000
is a lot of Hot Wheels.

41:28.521 --> 41:30.090
- What's
another word for brunch?

41:30.090 --> 41:31.224
- No, well, I don't--

41:31.257 --> 41:32.392
- Is there
another word for brunch?

41:32.425 --> 41:34.494
- No. Brunch is
barely a word, right?

41:34.527 --> 41:35.695
- Brunch is barely a word.

41:35.729 --> 41:37.297
- I think it's brunch.

41:37.330 --> 41:38.631
- To lunch.
- Lunch.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.100
- You feel comfortable?

41:40.100 --> 41:41.768
- I'm going to say "lunch."

41:41.801 --> 41:44.571
- So, lunch.
Lunch, all right.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.509
Thank you, Se Young.

41:49.542 --> 41:53.346
To double
your winnings to $14,000,

41:53.380 --> 41:57.117
Se Young, the password is...

41:59.185 --> 42:01.688
- Breakfast.

42:01.721 --> 42:03.156
Oh, no!
[audience groans]

42:03.189 --> 42:04.958
- She meant before brunch!

42:05.058 --> 42:08.061
- They said "lunch."
I'm sorry!

42:08.094 --> 42:12.065
But guess what. It's okay.
You're going home with $7,000.

42:12.065 --> 42:13.233
- Yeah!

42:13.266 --> 42:14.668
- 7,000 is still
a lot of Hot Wheels.

42:14.701 --> 42:16.670
- Thank you so much
for playing with us.

42:16.703 --> 42:18.138
That's our show.

42:18.171 --> 42:20.407
Thanks to Jimmy Fallon and
Meghan Trainor for being here

42:20.440 --> 42:21.841
and to all of you at home
for watching.
