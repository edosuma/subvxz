Season 4 Episode 18

03:05.560 --> 03:08.560
Original Airdate April 20, 2005

03:52.035 --> 03:53.494
"Election of prom royalty

03:53.541 --> 03:56.773
is an archaic and elitist ritual
whose time has come and gone."

03:56.829 --> 03:58.308
Chloe Sullivan strikes again.

03:58.358 --> 04:01.804
What? Oh, please don't tell me
I lost you to tiara fever, too.

04:01.839 --> 04:06.313
No, but balloons and taffeta seem a little
harmless compared to your usual targets.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.142
Well, this is how I see it. Homecoming
is for jocks, graduation's for parents,

04:10.177 --> 04:12.737
and prom is the rite of passage
that's for all of us.

04:12.772 --> 04:15.519
It's supposed to be a culmination
of four years of memories.

04:15.552 --> 04:19.826
Why do we have to ruin it with
the pinnacle of a popularity contest?

04:19.862 --> 04:23.089
So does that mean I order more pizza
for the Brad Pitt marathon?

04:23.136 --> 04:25.613
What, you're not going?
What happened with Jason?

04:25.648 --> 04:28.513
Showing up with the coach that
got fired for dating his student...

04:28.548 --> 04:30.929
That is an entrance
I could live without.

04:31.493 --> 04:32.326
Right.

04:32.632 --> 04:36.166
Besides, after imagining
something for four years,

04:36.201 --> 04:38.368
I just don't think it could
live up to expectations.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.127
Well, not if you're part
of the half-empty persuasion.

04:41.162 --> 04:43.393
And the Lana I know
wouldn't cop out like that.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.235
Come on, Lana,
it's gonna be so much fun.

04:46.270 --> 04:49.311
Lex even got Lifehouse
to play for the seniors.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.904
You can help me
bring stag back in style.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.637
Excuse me, coming through!

04:58.875 --> 05:00.695
Smells like school spirit.

05:01.859 --> 05:02.775
Chloe,

05:02.798 --> 05:07.542
You may think bashing a sacred school
tradition in your tabloid rag is cool,

05:07.589 --> 05:09.644
but I think
it's disgusting.

05:11.968 --> 05:13.342
Lighten up, Dawn.

05:13.377 --> 05:17.956
You'll get your throne, because this entire school
is terrified of you and your vicious rumor mill.

05:17.992 --> 05:19.776
Kill me now.

05:19.811 --> 05:22.301
You are such the Hypocrat.

05:22.433 --> 05:23.830
Hypocr...

05:24.288 --> 05:27.599
I'm sorry, whatever it is that you're saying
to me is getting lost in translation.

05:27.635 --> 05:29.173
Don't play stupid.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.719
The only reason you're picture's on
that wall is because of your lame article.

05:32.754 --> 05:34.008
What picture?

05:34.184 --> 05:35.652
What wall?

05:40.759 --> 05:43.272
I would say, may the best girl win.

05:43.295 --> 05:45.515
But I think we both know
who that is, hmm?

05:45.550 --> 05:46.912
Laters.

05:47.781 --> 05:51.843
So apparently, I'm not the only one
who enjoyed your article...

05:51.983 --> 05:53.169
Your Highness.

05:55.441 --> 05:56.404
Good luck.

06:02.913 --> 06:04.193
Who found her?

06:04.263 --> 06:05.156
The gardener...

06:05.200 --> 06:08.441
He was digging a drainage ditch.
The guy's pretty shaken up.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.147
How long has she been dead?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.451
At least a day.

06:24.867 --> 06:25.855
Lex...

06:26.149 --> 06:27.499
Oh, my god.

06:29.284 --> 06:30.986
Jason, what are you doing here?

06:31.033 --> 06:32.604
I came to talk to you about some reports,

06:32.639 --> 06:35.058
and then I saw security run out of the mansion.

06:36.326 --> 06:38.627
I found this, sir. We got an I.D.

06:45.063 --> 06:46.531
Bridgette Crosby.

06:46.684 --> 06:47.811
I know that name.

06:47.846 --> 06:49.699
I've come across it several times
in my research.

06:49.722 --> 06:51.671
She works for Virgil Swann, the billionaire.

06:51.707 --> 06:53.797
Look, this doesn't concern you.

06:54.055 --> 06:57.131
If it has anything to do with the artifacts,
it concerns me.

06:58.193 --> 07:01.915
Edwards, Lyle, will you please
escort Mr. Teague to his car?

07:15.520 --> 07:17.505
Now, should I bow to you when I see you, or...

07:17.540 --> 07:18.902
Cute. Very cute.

07:18.937 --> 07:21.492
What about "boycotting the vote",
didn't anyone understand?

07:21.516 --> 07:23.230
Oh, they understand it perfectly.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.780
You see, you are the boycott.

07:24.909 --> 07:26.747
I mean, think about it.
For the last four years,

07:26.773 --> 07:28.810
everybody's been trying to
break out of the stereotype

07:28.814 --> 07:30.349
they've been stuck in.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.398
You're the battle cry.

07:32.433 --> 07:36.234
Huh. The great Smallville High prom coup, huh?

07:36.763 --> 07:39.980
Clark, you didn't happen to have
anything to do with this, did you?

07:40.015 --> 07:42.176
I may have spoken to a few people.

07:43.209 --> 07:46.438
Now, I know you're not gonna
let me storm this Bastille alone.

07:46.462 --> 07:49.879
So who is Smallville's most eligible bachelor
taking to prom?

07:51.590 --> 07:53.683
I was actually

07:53.706 --> 07:55.585
thinking of sitting this one out.

07:56.041 --> 07:58.284
What? Oh, not you, too.

07:58.319 --> 08:02.097
Wait, let me guess. You spent four years
imagining what it would be like,

08:02.133 --> 08:05.233
and you just don't think it's gonna live up
to your expectations.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.182
Something like that.

08:07.323 --> 08:11.372
So you're gonna let me break out of
my rut on stage, wearing a sash,

08:11.407 --> 08:14.319
while you're at home playing the "what if? " Game
for the 900th time.

08:14.354 --> 08:15.538
I never said you were in a rut.

08:15.573 --> 08:17.663
Yeah, but I am, and I'm not alone.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.556
You know, Clark, in
a couple of weeks,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.632
we're gonna graduate from
this adolescent fantasy,

08:21.655 --> 08:24.215
and we're not gonna have
a rut to fall back into.

08:24.281 --> 08:26.355
The thing about expectations,
Clark, is they're

08:26.381 --> 08:28.473
supposed to drive you to
do more with your life,

08:28.508 --> 08:30.763
not stop you from living it.

08:30.821 --> 08:33.448
Personally, I think the
future holds a lot more

08:33.475 --> 08:35.719
promise for you than
you give it credit.

08:40.727 --> 08:44.039
So, 2:00 is tanning, 3:00 is nails,

08:44.073 --> 08:48.000
4:00 is hair, and the limo picks us up at 6:00.

08:48.751 --> 08:51.499
If I were you, I'd be more concerned about 12:00.

08:51.534 --> 08:52.955
We don't need to start that early.

08:52.978 --> 08:55.444
No, Dawn. 12:00.

08:57.484 --> 09:00.678
Is that your boyfriend crushing on a freshman?

09:00.713 --> 09:04.174
She is so not making
pep squad.

09:05.325 --> 09:07.298
First off, wonder bra,

09:07.356 --> 09:08.484
Laters.

09:10.421 --> 09:11.559
The Talon?

09:11.594 --> 09:13.660
Hi, can you say "mortified"?

09:13.707 --> 09:17.206
I mean, prom is only 27 hours away.

09:17.465 --> 09:18.322
Yeah,

09:18.545 --> 09:19.752
about that...

09:20.128 --> 09:21.231
I'm not going.

09:21.783 --> 09:23.263
Don't be stupid.

09:23.721 --> 09:25.153
Dawn, it's over.

09:25.588 --> 09:26.292
What?

09:26.339 --> 09:28.286
It should've been over a long time ago.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.288
I'm not hanging around
just so that I can be

09:30.314 --> 09:31.808
a bow tie that
matches your dress.

09:31.844 --> 09:35.119
You can't break up with
me the day before prom.

09:35.155 --> 09:36.057
It's over.

09:39.321 --> 09:40.401
Billy!

09:43.313 --> 09:44.687
That's harsh.

09:44.980 --> 09:46.096
Forget it.

09:46.131 --> 09:48.456
He's so yesterday's mystery meat.

09:49.533 --> 09:50.277
Okay.

09:50.306 --> 09:52.440
Massive re-strategy.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.212
I can't go to prom alone.
I need my king.

09:59.531 --> 10:01.750
Get me a yearbook.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.107
I need me some of this!

10:16.542 --> 10:18.068
Genius.

10:21.485 --> 10:22.648
Harmony,

10:22.894 --> 10:24.935
check out this profile.
Okay,

10:24.959 --> 10:27.425
gorgeous, captain of the football team,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.029
and single long enough
that I'm not sloppy seconds.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.319
Get me the digits for Clark Kent.

10:34.115 --> 10:35.266
Uh-huh...

10:36.968 --> 10:37.743
uh-huh.

11:46.340 --> 11:48.759
Stop! Please, stop!

11:51.859 --> 11:53.644
Please, stop!

12:09.059 --> 12:10.879
Holy crap.

12:10.914 --> 12:13.425
I'm Clark Kent's mom.

What's going on?

12:40.442 --> 12:41.652
Hi... son.

12:45.926 --> 12:47.112
What's for dinner?

12:47.147 --> 12:48.002
Dinner?

12:48.577 --> 12:49.763
Oh, right.

12:50.045 --> 12:50.820
Here,

12:51.125 --> 12:53.239
start with this. It's really yummy.

12:53.779 --> 12:55.070
Are you feeling okay?

12:55.106 --> 12:56.075
I'm great.

12:57.237 --> 12:59.233
I always wanted to ask you,

12:59.585 --> 13:02.345
do you have a date for the prom yet?

13:03.754 --> 13:05.836
Mom, I told you I'm not going to the prom.

13:05.883 --> 13:06.752
What?

13:07.069 --> 13:08.666
You have to go!

13:09.581 --> 13:10.791
Well, I...

13:11.061 --> 13:12.671
I kind of wanted to go with Lana, but...

13:12.675 --> 13:13.872
Lana Lang?

13:14.863 --> 13:18.714
Oh... You can't be serious.
You two are so last year.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.966
Clark, your prom

13:21.166 --> 13:23.644
is the most memorable night of your life.

13:23.996 --> 13:25.898
I am not going to
let you miss it.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.320
You can take me.

13:27.527 --> 13:30.002
Mom, you're already going,
remember, with dad?

13:30.005 --> 13:30.901
You're chaperons.

13:30.921 --> 13:31.872
Oh.

13:31.989 --> 13:34.044
Yeah. Right. Cool.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.871
Oh, I swear, the dog knows I'm allergic.

13:44.001 --> 13:46.607
He follows me around wherever I go.
He's torturing me.

13:46.933 --> 13:49.834
So... this is your little secret.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.857
You're taking her
to the prom, aren't you?

13:54.624 --> 13:55.669
Lois?

13:55.714 --> 13:58.586
Mrs. Kent, a lot of things
are possible in this world,

13:58.610 --> 14:01.968
but there will be a man on Mars before
Clark and I go to a prom together.

14:03.756 --> 14:05.691
So, what, you two just
get together and mack,

14:05.705 --> 14:07.293
but keep it on the
down low in public?

14:07.308 --> 14:08.072
Mom!

14:08.107 --> 14:10.456
I don't mean to be rude, Mrs. Kent,
but, uh,

14:10.491 --> 14:12.117
did you crack open the cooking sherry?

14:12.153 --> 14:13.268
Of course not.

14:13.409 --> 14:15.898
I'm just super pumped about prom.

14:18.059 --> 14:19.555
Well, I'm gonna go.

14:20.342 --> 14:23.148
Mom, maybe I should
take you to the Talon tonight.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.709
The Talon?

14:24.886 --> 14:26.823
Oh, right, I work there.

14:27.498 --> 14:29.283
Uh, no, I'm driving myself. Laters.

14:32.518 --> 14:33.728
"Laters"?

14:44.919 --> 14:47.032
I'm psyched Billy dumped Dawn.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.122
She was getting so stuck-up.

14:49.157 --> 14:52.137
I heard he already
hooked up with Sue Ann Gardner.

14:53.511 --> 14:57.160
Sue Ann Gardner is a big fat hoe.

15:00.894 --> 15:02.092
Mrs. Kent?

15:03.771 --> 15:04.605
Oh.

15:04.969 --> 15:06.000
Hi, Lana.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.571
Shouldn't you be at school
helping with the decorations?

15:08.618 --> 15:10.943
The prom committee
needs all the help they can get.

15:11.061 --> 15:12.998
I'm not gonna go to the prom.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.280
Why, you think you're so above it all?

15:16.771 --> 15:18.568
No, of course not.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.787
Oh, come on.

15:21.491 --> 15:23.394
Poor little orphan girl...

15:23.617 --> 15:26.517
Going off to your fancy
French Art School,

15:27.130 --> 15:29.337
going out with a big college guy...

15:30.793 --> 15:32.883
I don't have to listen to this.

15:33.224 --> 15:33.999
Hey.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.621
Genius.

15:49.309 --> 15:51.071
Lana, have you seen my mom?

15:51.294 --> 15:52.938
Forget about your mom, Clark.

15:53.278 --> 15:56.061
I have been meaning
to ask you something.

15:56.366 --> 15:57.951
Yeah, sure, what is it?

15:58.170 --> 16:00.941
Well, I know that
it's kind of last-minute,

16:00.988 --> 16:05.133
but I thought it'd be totally amazing

16:05.157 --> 16:06.800
if we went to prom together.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.198
Us?

16:10.513 --> 16:12.122
Lana, what about Jason?

16:12.157 --> 16:14.294
Clark, it's you I want to go with.

16:17.265 --> 16:19.238
Don't you want to go with me?

16:22.967 --> 16:25.386
- Well, I mean, I...
- Awesome, it's a date.

16:25.433 --> 16:27.480
I've gotta get back
to the school and help set up.

16:27.535 --> 16:29.403
They're lost without me.

16:31.597 --> 16:32.677
Laters.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.207
Mom...

16:42.486 --> 16:43.661
mom, are you all right?

16:44.990 --> 16:46.223
For the life of me,

16:46.258 --> 16:48.677
I can't remember how I got here.

17:00.499 --> 17:02.202
Looking great, guys.

17:02.530 --> 17:03.657
That's perfect,

17:03.693 --> 17:05.489
but remember to
use enough tape, okay?

17:05.512 --> 17:08.348
Too much is always
better than not enough.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.106
Gimme that.

17:12.821 --> 17:13.877
Harmony,

17:14.253 --> 17:16.623
this is supposed to be
cotton candy pink.

17:16.659 --> 17:18.385
Why is it sea foam green?

17:18.724 --> 17:21.214
Nice Dawn Stiles impersonation.

17:21.272 --> 17:24.303
Yeah, you have the queen bitch
control freak down-pat.

17:24.453 --> 17:26.226
What's that supposed to mean?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.246
Where is Dawn, anyway?

17:28.339 --> 17:30.694
I have no clue, and
honestly, we'll get way

17:30.720 --> 17:32.967
more done without her
ordering us around.

17:39.081 --> 17:40.901
See you guys tomorrow.

17:45.528 --> 17:47.547
You worked up quite a sweat.

17:48.169 --> 17:49.156
Hey, Lana,

17:49.778 --> 17:52.385
I didn't expect to see you
decorating for the prom.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.721
Well, maybe there's more
to me than meets the eye.

17:55.273 --> 17:57.856
Heard you got over Dawn Stiles pretty quick.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.251
I couldn't stand to spend
another second with her.

18:00.286 --> 18:02.023
I mean, her voice... it's a little too

18:02.030 --> 18:03.425
"nail on the chalkboard", you
know what I mean?

18:03.467 --> 18:05.710
No, I don't know what you mean!

18:09.737 --> 18:11.586
But I have an idea.

18:12.214 --> 18:13.802
Why don't you go clean up,

18:13.842 --> 18:15.345
and then we can hang out

18:15.389 --> 18:17.104
and get to know each other better?

18:19.311 --> 18:20.544
Be right back.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.691
Chloe.

18:44.407 --> 18:45.698
Have you seen Lana?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.195
The only people here are
the school spirit club

18:48.213 --> 18:50.486
spreading their
prom-agenda. Why?

18:50.605 --> 18:52.901
There's something going on.
My mom started to act strange.

18:52.910 --> 18:54.800
It's like she's channeling
some inner teenager,

18:54.807 --> 18:56.602
now Lana's not acting like herself.

18:56.626 --> 18:58.816
Well, if you think Lana's
here decorating for the prom,

18:58.825 --> 19:01.163
that definitely falls into altered states.

19:06.367 --> 19:07.354
Lana...

19:09.584 --> 19:10.817
What are you doing in here?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.937
Nobody breaks up with Dawn Stiles.

19:25.871 --> 19:27.181
Clark?

19:39.704 --> 19:41.782
Lana, what's going on?

19:41.827 --> 19:42.944
I don't know.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.005
Lana, you were just in there.

20:06.228 --> 20:07.931
I don't even know how I got to school.

20:21.937 --> 20:23.992
That was Clark. He's at the hospital.

20:24.027 --> 20:25.577
Billy's gonna make a full recovery.

20:25.624 --> 20:26.598
Good.

20:26.739 --> 20:28.589
Clark said he saw me come
out of that locker room.

20:28.615 --> 20:29.231
Do you think

20:29.262 --> 20:31.659
I could've done anything
when I was blacked out?

20:33.326 --> 20:35.440
Why would I ever hurt Billy Durden?

20:35.472 --> 20:36.705
You wouldn't.

20:36.740 --> 20:38.784
But Dawn Stiles would.

20:39.018 --> 20:41.695
Dawn? The girl most likely
to be prom queen?

20:41.731 --> 20:44.118
People were saying that you
were acting freakishly like her,

20:44.154 --> 20:46.165
and Clark's mom was
acting very Dawn-ish

20:46.191 --> 20:48.300
before she came back
on-line at the Talon.

20:48.492 --> 20:50.711
That's the last thing I
remember before blacking out...

20:50.844 --> 20:52.641
talking to Martha Kent in the Talon.

20:52.676 --> 20:55.066
And Mrs. Kent says the
last thing she remembers

20:55.092 --> 20:56.410
is driving along route 54.

20:56.445 --> 20:59.930
That's where they found Dawn's body
at the bottom of Carlton gorge...

21:00.311 --> 21:02.660
The mother lode of all meteor rock.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.834
Oh, my god.

21:03.867 --> 21:05.342
They have her in the
emergency room.

21:05.362 --> 21:07.191
She's in a deep coma.

21:07.824 --> 21:11.147
So you think that her spirit was
somehow able to take over Martha

21:11.182 --> 21:13.436
and then transfer into me?

21:13.648 --> 21:15.925
Well, we are in Smallville,

21:15.961 --> 21:18.336
and, I mean, what would
the senior prom be without a

21:18.371 --> 21:20.860
body-snatching prom queen?

21:29.878 --> 21:30.947
Lana, are you okay?

21:30.982 --> 21:32.767
Yeah, I just feel really horrible.

21:32.814 --> 21:34.434
I have no idea what I did.

21:34.469 --> 21:37.417
Well, you didn't do anything.
You were inhabited by Dawn Stiles.

21:37.710 --> 21:42.381
And the question is, now that we have
the old Lana back, where's the new Dawn?

21:45.974 --> 21:47.312
How is she?

21:47.406 --> 21:49.205
Well, she's barely hanging on.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.540
She's got massive head injuries,
and she's severely disfigured.

21:52.575 --> 21:53.973
Disfigured?

21:57.072 --> 21:58.490
No, it couldn't be.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.919
That face was so perfect.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.228
Eww... Gross.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.570
Uh, you're not allowed in here.

22:21.943 --> 22:23.164
Really.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.636
I'm terrified to even think what else

22:28.662 --> 22:30.789
I could've said or done
during that last hour.

22:31.386 --> 22:34.240
So you don't remember what
you said to me at the Talon today?

22:34.498 --> 22:35.754
Oh, no.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.598
What'd I say?

22:39.101 --> 22:40.427
You just, um,

22:40.917 --> 22:42.502
asked me to prom.

22:43.242 --> 22:44.052
Oh.

22:45.038 --> 22:45.860
Really?

22:45.895 --> 22:48.467
It wasn't you, though, right?
It was Dawn, so...

22:50.059 --> 22:52.511
<i>Code blue, room 256.</i>

22:52.885 --> 22:55.844
<i>Code blue, room 256.</i>

22:57.582 --> 22:59.484
Excuse me, are you friends of Dawn's?

22:59.821 --> 23:01.242
Yes, what happened?

23:01.500 --> 23:04.201
There's nothing they can do.
I'm afraid she passed on.

23:04.307 --> 23:06.432
I'm sure she didn't suffer.

23:07.336 --> 23:08.733
I'm sorry.

23:21.215 --> 23:22.168
Genius.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.501
Find anything interesting?

23:47.452 --> 23:49.178
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

23:49.210 --> 23:52.354
You've crossed the line, Jason.
I take my privacy very seriously.

23:52.404 --> 23:54.658
And I take murder very seriously.

23:55.008 --> 23:57.145
It says here you sent an
e-mail to Bridgette Crosby.

23:57.180 --> 23:59.162
I never denied I knew her.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.055
Confirming a meeting
between the two of you

24:02.060 --> 24:03.600
here at the
Luthor's mansion

24:03.636 --> 24:06.757
on the same morning
she was found face-down in the dirt.

24:07.203 --> 24:10.773
Well, Ms. Crosby never
showed up for that meeting.

24:13.508 --> 24:15.639
You mentioned
an item in your e-mail.

24:15.873 --> 24:18.081
I assume you're
talking about an artifact.

24:18.574 --> 24:20.539
What were you gonna do,
you were gonna buy it from her,

24:20.545 --> 24:22.001
or were you gonna
take it with force?

24:22.048 --> 24:24.531
I don't need to explain
myself to you, Jason.

24:24.568 --> 24:26.780
No, but you're gonna have
to explain it to the police.

24:26.815 --> 24:28.622
Look, I have no interest
being in the middle

24:28.648 --> 24:29.666
of a murder investigation

24:29.701 --> 24:31.333
I had nothing to do with,

24:31.368 --> 24:33.635
not to mention the media circus
that comes with it.

24:33.670 --> 24:36.218
There was a dead body
found on your property, Lex.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.214
It's kinda hard to ignore.

24:38.261 --> 24:39.940
Trust me, I'm not.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.298
Who are you trying to protect...

24:43.779 --> 24:44.625
You?

24:44.989 --> 24:46.126
Your father?

24:48.779 --> 24:53.640
Burying bodies in the backyard
isn't exactly a hobby of mine, Jason.

24:58.540 --> 25:02.109
Yeah, well, covering up a homicide
isn't exactly a hobby of mine.

25:02.638 --> 25:04.867
I think I'll go have
a chat with the sheriff.

25:17.879 --> 25:19.464
I just went to see the allergist.

25:19.499 --> 25:21.965
This says I owe $200.

25:22.857 --> 25:26.776
Actually, it's $215,
including lab fees.

25:26.976 --> 25:29.251
But all they did was stick
a bunch of needles.

25:29.265 --> 25:31.277
In my back and make me really itchy.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.647
What's that all about?

25:32.671 --> 25:35.299
Well, they need to find out
what you're allergic to.

25:35.322 --> 25:37.060
I know what I'm allergic to.

25:37.107 --> 25:38.962
He's got four legs and drools.

25:38.997 --> 25:41.134
What I need is a prescription.

25:41.945 --> 25:42.894
Please.

25:43.058 --> 25:44.831
A dog's life depends on it.

25:47.496 --> 25:48.424
Miss...

25:50.444 --> 25:52.003
maybe I can help you.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.558
Hey, you guys look great.

26:06.723 --> 26:10.151
Clark, the only reason we agreed
to be chaperons was because of you.

26:10.198 --> 26:11.990
I know. It's a little backwards.

26:11.995 --> 26:14.915
My parents are going to the prom,
and I'm staying home to wait up for them.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.090
Son, when you're older, we don't want you
to have to look back on high school

26:18.106 --> 26:19.566
and regret not going to the prom.

26:19.575 --> 26:21.665
Dad, I'm not sure that
standing by the punch bowl and

26:21.668 --> 26:24.145
watching bad dancing is a
memory I'm gonna cherish.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.383
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Clark.

26:26.441 --> 26:27.475
Let's go.

26:27.533 --> 26:29.154
I'll bring the truck around.

26:33.219 --> 26:35.462
I think I know why
you're not going tonight.

26:36.049 --> 26:37.587
When I was a freshman,

26:38.139 --> 26:41.391
I remember standing outside
and watching the seniors going into prom.

26:41.532 --> 26:44.445
The guys in their tuxes
and the girls in their dresses.

26:45.983 --> 26:47.991
I guess I always thought that
that would be Lana and me.

26:48.026 --> 26:49.494
Oh, Clark...

26:49.588 --> 26:52.310
Things don't always end up
the way you picture them, but

26:52.415 --> 26:55.621
sometimes they can end up
even better if you give them a chance.

26:57.687 --> 27:00.680
If you change your mind,
I put your tux by the door.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.328
You rented me a tux?

27:06.528 --> 27:07.749
Just in case.

27:07.866 --> 27:08.756
Mom...

27:13.805 --> 27:14.709
Well?

27:22.206 --> 27:23.381
How do I look?

27:25.788 --> 27:27.373
It looks like you're going to the prom.

27:27.443 --> 27:28.474
I am.

27:31.374 --> 27:32.830
And you're taking me.

27:33.664 --> 27:36.151
I'm not gonna let you
sit around moping all night

27:36.186 --> 27:39.227
while your parents go out and
do the electric Boogaloo all night.

27:39.509 --> 27:40.648
It's gonna be fun.

27:41.799 --> 27:44.030
No, I-I'm not going.

27:44.749 --> 27:46.311
Massive re-strategy.

27:46.346 --> 27:49.153
You're going to your senior prom
whether you like it or not.

27:49.188 --> 27:51.501
End of discussion.
Put on your tux.

27:53.098 --> 27:56.151
Lois, wasn't this "not in
the realm of possibilities"?

27:56.233 --> 27:58.159
Anything's possible, Clark.

27:58.922 --> 27:59.826
Anything.

28:04.929 --> 28:06.080
Over here, sheriff.

28:08.076 --> 28:09.332
Wait a second.

28:10.495 --> 28:13.313
The body was right here,
it was right next to this rock.

28:13.724 --> 28:15.906
They must've just built this gazebo.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.703
Well, according to the county records,

28:17.738 --> 28:20.909
the gazebo's been here since before
the Luthors even heard of Smallville.

28:20.944 --> 28:22.657
Sheriff, I know what I saw.

28:22.709 --> 28:25.885
The dead and decaying
body of one Bridgette Crosby.

28:26.354 --> 28:29.124
Mr. Teague, I'll level with you. A good
murder mystery is just the kind of thing

28:29.159 --> 28:30.664
I could use right about now.

28:30.690 --> 28:32.641
The thing is, you can't have
a murder without a victim.

28:32.670 --> 28:35.555
And, see, this Bridgette Crosby...
There's no record that she ever existed.

28:35.590 --> 28:37.680
This is crazy. Of course she existed.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.924
Well, every government database
from the IRS to the PTA

28:40.971 --> 28:42.826
happens to disagree with you.

28:42.903 --> 28:44.875
I even went on one
of those Google searches.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.753
It kept asking me if
I meant "Bing Crosby."

28:48.657 --> 28:49.702
The gardener.

28:49.737 --> 28:51.604
The gardener found the body.
Did you question him?

28:51.625 --> 28:53.856
I questioned the entire landscaping staff.

28:55.465 --> 28:58.142
It's Lex. He's paid them off,
or he's intimidating them.

28:58.165 --> 28:59.974
Or you're yanking my rope.

29:00.537 --> 29:03.423
Mr. Teague, the next time
you say there's been a killing,

29:03.905 --> 29:05.771
I'd better see a stiff.

29:27.927 --> 29:29.148
Hello, mother.

29:30.428 --> 29:31.732
Oh, it's done.

29:32.436 --> 29:35.125
Lex took care of the body
just like we wanted.

29:36.722 --> 29:38.918

have any natural disasters.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.769

31:17.450 --> 31:20.620
Yeah, well, remember all those
regrets we were talking about?

31:20.878 --> 31:24.374

31:40.969 --> 31:41.803
Why?

31:42.249 --> 31:45.091
I came to, uh, cheer you on, of course.

31:45.831 --> 31:48.109
Excuse me, everybody, excuse me!

31:48.426 --> 31:49.518
Thanks, guys.

doing at your prom?

32:45.346 --> 32:46.309
Oh, no.

32:51.313 --> 32:52.939
Did you pin that on me?

32:53.074 --> 32:55.000
I... I'll explain later, Lois.

32:55.047 --> 32:57.007

don't you think?

32:57.043 --> 32:59.303

Okay, Smallville,

34:03.326 --> 34:06.109
I clicked my heels together three times,
and nothing happened.

Yeah, Chloe... she's not...

35:22.823 --> 35:26.405
She's not acting like herself.
She took off down the stairs. I-I'm fine.

Dad, I need you
to get something for me.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.465

36:23.466 --> 36:25.131
How did you do that?

36:26.376 --> 36:28.008
I know it's you, Dawn.

36:28.243 --> 36:29.311
You don't want to do this.

36:29.346 --> 36:32.560
All those years I kept trying
to be what everyone else wanted,

36:32.595 --> 36:35.190
and it turns out those
losers don't even care.

36:35.413 --> 36:37.867
This was supposed to be
the best night of my life,

36:37.902 --> 36:39.584
and they laughed at me.

36:39.619 --> 36:41.310
Let Chloe go.

36:42.132 --> 36:43.294
I will.

36:47.321 --> 36:51.240
and I can be whoever I want.

Clark?

36:57.452 --> 36:59.668
The crown's mine, bitch.

37:02.181 --> 37:03.367
Genius.

37:10.780 --> 37:11.672
Dawn!

37:13.985 --> 37:15.488
Seriously, Mr. Kent,

37:15.523 --> 37:16.979
you can't stop me.

37:17.085 --> 37:18.271
That may be true,

37:18.304 --> 37:20.300
but I can stop my son.

37:32.936 --> 37:34.263
What is that?

37:34.920 --> 37:37.010
It's time for you to leave, Dawn!

38:05.678 --> 38:06.629
Chloe!

38:07.368 --> 38:08.352
Chloe...

38:10.137 --> 38:11.229
Are you okay?

38:11.311 --> 38:12.882
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

38:22.110 --> 38:23.613

Dawn was possessing me?
