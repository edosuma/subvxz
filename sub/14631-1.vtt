WEBVTT

00:29.708 --> 00:30.957
One day it happens.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.124
You're standing somewhere

00:34.333 --> 00:37.790
and you realize you don't want
to be any of those around you.

00:46.208 --> 00:49.582
You don't want to be
the dickhead you just beat up.

00:57.625 --> 01:01.624
Your honor, I've got
15 stitches here and 25 here.

01:01.833 --> 01:03.499
Or your father,

01:04.208 --> 01:05.624
or your brother,

01:06.625 --> 01:08.540
or anyone
in your fucking family.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.332
Son of a bitch!

01:24.125 --> 01:25.832
The accused will stand.

01:29.625 --> 01:33.665
This court finds
Hugo Olivera Castro

01:33.875 --> 01:35.499
guilty of assault,

01:35.708 --> 01:36.915
Or the judge.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.707
and sentences him
to 18 months in prison,

01:40.166 --> 01:44.707
commuted to a fine of 6,000 euros
as this is a first offense.

01:45.375 --> 01:46.040
Or even yourself.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.665
Court is adjourned.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.999
You just want to run away.

01:53.416 --> 01:55.457
You must be careful
from now on.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.165
There can be
no more violent incidents.

01:58.375 --> 02:01.457
Another offense
means you'll go to prison.

02:02.291 --> 02:03.999
Hugo, are you listening?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.457
- Why didn't mom come?
- She's on a trip.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.124
And don't call me Hugo.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.039
Fuck.

02:19.541 --> 02:22.457
Get the hell out
of wherever you are.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.290
Come on!

04:00.750 --> 04:02.374
And suddenly it happens.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.165
Something clicks.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.540
And you know that
things are going to change.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.415
They've changed already.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.415
Dogface!

04:26.083 --> 04:27.290
Yeah, you!

04:36.791 --> 04:37.624
Dogface.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.957
And they'll never
be the same again.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.915
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

05:05.208 --> 05:06.290
Never.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.874
And when it happens,

05:10.833 --> 05:12.082
you know.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.874
THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY

05:19.875 --> 05:21.540
- Babi!
- Okay.

05:21.875 --> 05:22.957
Hurry!

05:25.375 --> 05:26.915
Good morning.
Silence.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.749
Silence!

05:30.916 --> 05:32.124
- May I?
- Late.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.707
Close your notebooks, please.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.374
She'll pick me.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.665
Fernández Camino,

05:44.541 --> 05:45.874
Luna Vergara,

05:47.125 --> 05:48.749
and Dueñas Martín...

05:48.958 --> 05:50.832
No, she's outside.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.290
Absent.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.207
So,

05:56.250 --> 05:57.582
Herreruela.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.290
Translation.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.207
Take your phone.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.290
Domus itinere

06:07.250 --> 06:08.415
eunte,

06:12.166 --> 06:13.499
moltus

06:13.958 --> 06:15.790
ambulantus

06:19.375 --> 06:20.540
fuit.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.915
Herreruela...

06:36.666 --> 06:38.832
On the way home

06:41.375 --> 06:42.999
he had to walk a lot.

06:43.458 --> 06:44.457
A lot.

06:46.916 --> 06:50.332
You'll have to study a lot
to get into college.

06:51.791 --> 06:52.874
Cell.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.707
Miss Alcázar,

07:18.666 --> 07:20.332
won't you take my call?

07:27.916 --> 07:29.207
Sit down.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.832
We'll continue. De strictus
sensi cui super impia.

07:35.083 --> 07:35.832
Babi!

07:36.583 --> 07:37.290
I'm sorry.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.374
- It's OK.
- Silence!

07:57.250 --> 08:00.540
Mara, doing it a few times
doesn't mean you're dating.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.915
So what? Anyway, his pals
told me he never calls.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.499
And you believe his pals?
Just look at them.

08:14.833 --> 08:15.999
Claudio,

08:16.208 --> 08:17.540
change your tie.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.749
This looks better.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.999
- Girls, are you ready?
- Yes, mom.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.457
If you want a lift,
we're leaving now!

08:27.666 --> 08:29.790
With this make-up,
how old do I look?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.915
At least 15.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.082
But I am 15.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.332
Let's see.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.082
Like that,

08:44.791 --> 08:46.999
you're about to turn 16.

09:05.291 --> 09:06.374
H!

09:06.583 --> 09:10.999
I wouldn't ask, but it's urgent.
I need 400 euros for my bike.

09:11.208 --> 09:14.540
- It's in the repair shop!
- Don't worry about that now.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.415
Chino!

09:26.041 --> 09:29.957
We've got a new contest
on the Bandstand!

09:30.416 --> 09:32.082
Are you ready?

09:32.291 --> 09:34.165
The countdown has started!

09:37.000 --> 09:39.624
Who'll be king of the Bandstand?

09:39.833 --> 09:41.790
On your marks! Get ready!

09:42.291 --> 09:43.040
Go!

09:43.291 --> 09:44.332
One!

09:45.125 --> 09:46.290
Two!

09:46.708 --> 09:48.082
Three! Four!

09:48.583 --> 09:50.499
Five! Six!

09:57.541 --> 10:00.207
Don't act like you're desperately
seeking someone.

10:00.416 --> 10:02.082
But I am.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.665
There he is!

10:05.875 --> 10:06.957
Dani!

10:08.708 --> 10:10.707
- Don't go...
- Hi, Rubén!

10:12.916 --> 10:15.665
Shit, with all that make-up
I didn't recognize you.

10:17.666 --> 10:18.957
Would you like something?

10:19.166 --> 10:20.582
Yes, come on.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.415
Thirty!

10:28.833 --> 10:29.874
Thirty one!

10:30.083 --> 10:31.165
Thirty two!

10:31.375 --> 10:32.332
Thirty three!

10:32.541 --> 10:35.374
- Thirty four!
- That's the first one down!

10:38.875 --> 10:40.207
Katina!

10:40.416 --> 10:42.332
I thought you weren't coming!

10:42.583 --> 10:46.499
I was at another party,
but it was full of gays.

10:46.708 --> 10:47.415
A real bore.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.290
Someone else who was bored
brought me here.

10:50.958 --> 10:53.165
That's him,
chasing Berta's brother.

10:56.833 --> 10:57.790
Hello!

10:58.708 --> 11:00.874
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, yes!

11:01.083 --> 11:02.499
Thank you.
Want some?

11:03.208 --> 11:05.749
No? Well, the drinks
are back there

11:05.958 --> 11:07.290
and there's a bar outside.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.040
See you later!

11:10.333 --> 11:14.124
I love this song.
Let's talk to my new gay friend.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.165
Fifty one! Fifty two!

11:17.500 --> 11:18.957
Fifty three!

11:19.708 --> 11:21.582
Travolta, you're slipping!

11:22.500 --> 11:25.457
Fifty six! Fifty seven!

11:57.041 --> 11:59.665
Eighty two! Eighty three!

11:59.875 --> 12:01.874
Eighty four! Eighty five!

12:02.083 --> 12:05.540
Ten seconds! Come on!
Let's have a final sprint!

12:06.000 --> 12:09.749
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

12:10.375 --> 12:11.707
Come on!

12:12.000 --> 12:14.790
seven, eight,

12:16.750 --> 12:17.915
nine,

12:23.083 --> 12:24.290
- and ten!
- Ten!

12:29.791 --> 12:31.957
There's a new king
of the Bandstand!

12:32.166 --> 12:35.665
Chino has lost his throne
after two years!

12:36.666 --> 12:38.832
There's a private party up town!

12:39.041 --> 12:41.749
- Can we go?
- Sure, I've got tickets!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.457
- Coming?
- Not to a rich kids' party.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.082
Will you ever forgive me?

13:02.083 --> 13:06.249
I've been looking for a reason
to do it, but I can't find one.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.707
Typical of a woman.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.624
See? That "typical"
is what ruins everything.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.540
You're beautiful tonight.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.290
Tonight?

13:19.041 --> 13:20.082
Always.

13:21.416 --> 13:25.249
Alicia, your brother rang,
he's coming with some friends.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.832
But I'm an only child!

13:34.958 --> 13:36.499
- Yes?
- Hello!

13:37.500 --> 13:38.874
- Who's my brother?
- Sis!

13:39.083 --> 13:40.540
Sis!

13:41.708 --> 13:43.582
There are canapés...

13:54.666 --> 13:56.290
Listen to the music!

13:57.458 --> 13:58.624
My little sister!

14:38.708 --> 14:39.915
Close the door!

14:48.208 --> 14:49.249
What do you want?

14:49.583 --> 14:50.749
My purse.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.915
- Take it.
- I can't.

14:53.791 --> 14:55.040
Some idiot got it first.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.207
Here.

15:00.791 --> 15:04.374
Didn't your mother tell you
not to snoop in girls' purses?

15:04.625 --> 15:06.249
I don't know my mother.

15:07.875 --> 15:11.040
- But I'd tell yours something.
- Really? What?

15:11.833 --> 15:14.499
You can't go around
with just 50 euros.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.165
That's my week's allowance.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.707
- It was.
- Now I'll go hungry.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.457
If you want,
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.457
You know what?

15:24.708 --> 15:27.707
When I'm paying,
I like to choose my company.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.124
- What's that?
- Never mind!

15:30.333 --> 15:32.249
Stop it! Stop!

15:34.500 --> 15:35.790
Holy shit!

15:36.958 --> 15:39.457
Forget about lunch.
What would we do after?

15:39.666 --> 15:40.790
Tell jokes?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.957
Look, I wouldn't laugh at yours
and you wouldn't understand mine.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.665
The jokes, I mean.

15:48.333 --> 15:49.499
Half-wit!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.457
If you dare take any alcohol
I'll tell mom.

16:02.666 --> 16:03.582
Excuse me?

16:03.791 --> 16:05.082
Don't you remember?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.374
I accompanied you to school
this morning.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.832
Well, I was your escort.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.915
You were the one
shouting stupidities.

16:14.541 --> 16:18.207
No, I just said one.
"Dogface".

16:18.458 --> 16:19.790
You liked it, right?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.082
It always works
with girls like you.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.249
Like me?

16:23.458 --> 16:25.249
Up-tight and keen to break out.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.540
Do you want something?

16:27.750 --> 16:29.374
A Coca-cola, please.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.665
I have to drive.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.165
Babi?

16:34.375 --> 16:35.915
No, I served myself.

16:36.750 --> 16:40.249
See? When you're pleasant
you're not such a dogface.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.499
What?

16:50.750 --> 16:52.374
- Chico!
- Pollo, take this.

16:54.041 --> 16:57.790
No, put me down, you brute!
Let go of me!

17:06.665 --> 17:11.249
No, no! I'm sorry I threw
the milk shake at you!

17:11.458 --> 17:14.249
The damage has been done.

17:31.958 --> 17:33.499
You're out of your mind!

17:34.041 --> 17:35.832
I'm wearing a Valentino!

17:38.041 --> 17:40.999
- It's freezing!
- It's good for the circulation.

17:41.208 --> 17:43.374
It pumps more blood
to your brain.

17:43.583 --> 17:46.999
You offer milk shakes,
you don't throw them at people.

17:47.916 --> 17:49.707
And tell Valentino

17:50.333 --> 17:52.415
the dress looks a lot better wet.

17:57.625 --> 17:58.915
The police, please.

17:59.125 --> 18:00.624
Shall I get you a towel?

18:00.833 --> 18:02.499
You don't want to catch cold.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.124
Go to hell!

18:04.541 --> 18:05.874
Move, they rang the cops!

18:06.083 --> 18:07.207
Remind me

18:07.416 --> 18:10.707
the next time we bathe together
to wash your mouth with soap.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.707
Why did you do nothing
when he threw me in the pool?

18:27.916 --> 18:28.749
Babi,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.790
it was all a set-up.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.999
I rang those idiots to cause
a fuss so I could be with you.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.332
Roberta will never forgive you.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.249
They wrecked the house.

18:42.458 --> 18:43.832
What the hell...?

18:47.208 --> 18:48.290
What are they doing?

18:49.666 --> 18:50.874
Go away!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.624
Stop it, please!

18:56.500 --> 18:58.207
This is my father's car!

18:58.416 --> 18:59.582
Bastards!

19:03.666 --> 19:05.082
You want aggro?

19:28.750 --> 19:31.374
- You're fucking crazy!
- Go to hell!

19:35.250 --> 19:36.540
Are you OK?

19:48.458 --> 19:49.624
Shit!

19:50.250 --> 19:51.332
It's nothing.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.082
Just some scratches.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.124
- They could have killed us!
- It's all right.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.832
There's still time.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.124
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?

19:59.333 --> 20:00.915
For what? Tell me.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.749
For calling the police
or for the hit and run?

20:03.958 --> 20:04.874
You're so sexy.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.207
Leave him alone, you animal!

20:07.416 --> 20:10.957
You brute! Leave him alone!
You're despicable!

20:12.291 --> 20:13.749
You want to grovel?

20:13.958 --> 20:15.499
All right, say after me:

20:15.708 --> 20:17.790
- I will not ruin the party...
- Stop!

20:19.833 --> 20:22.749
I will not ruin the party

20:22.958 --> 20:25.207
for people who know
how to have fun.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.540
I won't ruin the party...

20:27.750 --> 20:28.999
Please, help me!

20:29.208 --> 20:31.457
...for people who know
how to have fun.

20:31.666 --> 20:33.290
- Mr. Santamaría!
- What's going on?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.790
They're going
to kill each other!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.665
Boys, that's enough!

20:38.375 --> 20:41.249
Let's get out of here!
Babi, come with us!

20:42.416 --> 20:44.040
Fuck, it was your fault
that I hit him!

20:44.250 --> 20:45.665
You made me hit him!

20:46.666 --> 20:47.749
Get in the car!

20:47.958 --> 20:51.957
- I won't...
- I won't ruin... That's it.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.040
Leave him alone!

20:54.833 --> 20:56.040
I hate you!

20:56.375 --> 20:59.249
You're an animal, a brute!

20:59.458 --> 21:00.832
I hate you!

21:01.375 --> 21:02.707
Put me down!

21:03.750 --> 21:06.040
All right,
I've put you down.

21:10.541 --> 21:11.832
And he's gone.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.082
I'll say goodbye too.

21:19.208 --> 21:20.999
How do I get home?

21:35.083 --> 21:36.790
- Let me get on the bike.
- What?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.624
Let me get on the bike.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.207
You said I'm an animal
and a brute, right?

21:43.791 --> 21:46.332
I can't let someone like that
take you home.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.124
It's for your own good.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.999
Tomorrow you'd regret
not being consistent.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.082
Stop, please.

21:56.291 --> 21:57.540
Want to go somewhere?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.665
You want your face smashed?

21:59.875 --> 22:00.832
Scram.

22:01.041 --> 22:02.082
Scram!

22:09.541 --> 22:12.749
Get on, I've fought enough people
because of you.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.874
Wait, wait.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.290
I'm paralyzed.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.165
You're squeezing me.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.207
If you grab my jacket
I can't drive.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.290
Please...

23:05.208 --> 23:08.165
You want to stay like this
all night?

23:08.375 --> 23:11.457
Sorry, I've never ridden
on the back of a bike.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.290
So I'm the first, right?

23:16.458 --> 23:17.582
Shit!

23:25.041 --> 23:26.207
Babi!

23:27.041 --> 23:29.249
- Did you come on that bike?
- No, mom...

23:29.458 --> 23:32.582
She had no choice, ma'am, really.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.332
The boy who was driving her
dumped her

23:36.833 --> 23:38.832
and she had to come with me.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.457
Hi, mom!

23:42.666 --> 23:45.624
Didn't I tell you
to stay with your sister!

23:45.833 --> 23:47.540
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.624
Get in the car.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.957
You two won't have
any kind of phone for a week!

23:53.166 --> 23:55.749
You're exactly like your mother.

23:56.583 --> 23:57.624
A grouch.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.332
Are you seeing that guy?

24:06.541 --> 24:07.915
I don't even know him.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.832
He's Hugo Olivera,

24:10.041 --> 24:11.332
but they call him H.

24:11.541 --> 24:14.790
Something horrible happened
and he wants to forget his name.

24:15.041 --> 24:17.540
My friends and I say
it's H for "hero".

24:18.458 --> 24:19.957
He looks like
he'd save your life.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.874
Who the hell let you in?

24:27.083 --> 24:30.040
- Get up, you've things to do!
- Yeah, for you!

24:32.791 --> 24:34.249
No, I understand.

24:34.583 --> 24:38.832
But I could go to Paris next week
and we'll close the deal.

24:40.458 --> 24:42.957
Alex, I need to borrow 400 euros.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.790
Fuck, what a drag.

24:45.000 --> 24:45.665
Wait.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.832
We'll talk to Head Office.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.249
Yeah, sure.

24:49.958 --> 24:50.874
OK.

24:51.083 --> 24:53.540
What are you doing?
Give me that!

24:56.000 --> 24:56.832
Are you crazy?

24:57.041 --> 24:58.874
Don't give it to him!

24:59.083 --> 25:01.332
Don't speak! Don't speak!

25:01.541 --> 25:02.749
Yes, of course.

25:02.958 --> 25:05.040
In my wallet, in my jacket.

25:11.583 --> 25:12.457
Yes!

25:12.750 --> 25:14.499
- No, of course.
- Thank you!

25:14.916 --> 25:17.624
Really, if he can't,
I'll see to it.

25:17.875 --> 25:20.457
Hugo, remember about dinner
with dad.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.790
Are you sure it's here?

25:28.000 --> 25:31.207
Yeah, I saw it in her diary,
and we're having lunch.

25:31.666 --> 25:34.874
- You're broke.
- She said she'd pay.

25:35.958 --> 25:37.582
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:39.416 --> 25:40.457
That's her!

25:40.708 --> 25:42.249
- Which one?
- The blonde.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.540
- Bye, Babi.
- Bye.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.582
And that's the girl
from the foam bath.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.540
I'm off.

25:48.750 --> 25:49.957
God, Babi!

25:50.166 --> 25:52.082
That's the guy
who stole my allowance.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.999
- Which one?
- The ugly one beside the bike.

25:56.666 --> 25:57.790
Oh, no!

25:58.000 --> 25:59.207
Did he steal from you too?

25:59.416 --> 26:02.915
No, but his pal threw me in the pool
and wrecked Chico's car.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.915
You never tell me
the interesting things!

26:07.333 --> 26:08.374
Hello.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.207
What are you doing here?

26:10.416 --> 26:11.665
Hey, take it easy.

26:12.166 --> 26:16.040
I just came with my friend,
he's having lunch with that girl.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.499
But she happens
to be my best friend

26:18.708 --> 26:20.749
and your friend
stole all her money.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.165
You owe me one.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.457
Why not invite me somewhere nice?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.082
What do you say?

26:28.291 --> 26:29.249
Moron!

26:29.458 --> 26:31.082
How sweet!

26:31.291 --> 26:32.624
Coming for lunch?

26:32.833 --> 26:34.540
You can't have lunch with him!

26:34.750 --> 26:37.374
But he's paying, so I'll get
some of my money back.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.290
I thought she was paying.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.082
I swiped her money yesterday

26:41.291 --> 26:43.540
so it's like she was paying.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.124
Don't be angry.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.374
I'll call you later.

26:49.458 --> 26:50.540
Excuse me.

26:51.666 --> 26:53.790
Just to show I'm not a liar,

26:54.541 --> 26:57.332
didn't you and I have
a foam bath yesterday?

27:02.500 --> 27:04.124
That's a yes.

27:07.333 --> 27:08.999
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, love.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.207
Why is your brother so late?

27:19.375 --> 27:21.707
You know him,
he's always working.

27:24.416 --> 27:25.749
Where's mom?

27:27.500 --> 27:29.499
On a trip,
with a girl friend.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.165
What grade will you get?
8 or more?

28:06.375 --> 28:09.165
In Physics?
A distinction, definitely.

28:15.291 --> 28:17.999
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

28:18.208 --> 28:20.457
No, I'll take a break later.

28:21.916 --> 28:25.124
Wrap up well if you go out.
It's freezing.

28:25.416 --> 28:26.749
Yes, mom.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.957
Rebeca, did your son
ever argue with that man before?

28:44.333 --> 28:46.707
I didn't even know
they knew each other.

28:47.166 --> 28:48.415
With his injuries,

28:48.625 --> 28:51.624
if we don't have some proof

28:52.125 --> 28:53.915
Hugo could be in big trouble.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.249
Do you think
I don't want to help my son?

28:59.833 --> 29:00.790
Hugo,

29:02.041 --> 29:03.415
have you nothing to say?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.582
I'm moving in with you.

29:16.916 --> 29:18.957
Don't you want to know
how it went?

29:19.250 --> 29:20.457
How did it go?

29:20.666 --> 29:22.374
If you ask like that
I won't tell you.

29:22.583 --> 29:24.499
- All right, don't.
- Babi!

29:28.333 --> 29:31.790
Excuse me, that blonde hunk
was giving you the eye.

29:34.541 --> 29:36.874
He's still doing it.
Shall we follow him?

29:38.291 --> 29:40.582
Why are you looking like that?

29:40.833 --> 29:43.624
You dumped me
and went off with that thug.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.707
Hey, you don't know him!

29:46.000 --> 29:47.582
He's got problems.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.957
He's got no money.
His father treats him badly.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.624
But he's really nice.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.915
He asked me
to the races tonight.

29:55.125 --> 29:55.749
What races?

29:55.958 --> 29:57.790
I told mom
I'm sleeping at your house.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.707
- Leave a key under the mat.
- I don't believe this!

30:00.916 --> 30:02.332
- Why don't you come?
- No!

30:02.541 --> 30:04.790
I don't want to see him
or his friend.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.999
Then we're not going
to see each other either.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.874
- Why not?
- I'm going out with him!

30:12.875 --> 30:13.999
Katina!

30:16.500 --> 30:18.415
- Babi!
- Yes?

30:19.166 --> 30:20.290
Come here a moment.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.665
Coming.

30:26.833 --> 30:27.624
What?

30:31.041 --> 30:32.665
Haven't you something to tell us?

30:34.708 --> 30:36.457
The Santamarías rang.

30:36.666 --> 30:39.707
Felipe's nasal septum was broken,
it almost pierced his brain!

30:39.916 --> 30:43.374
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It's true, she didn't.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.665
Who asked you?
Be quiet!

30:45.875 --> 30:47.332
Look, Babi,

30:47.541 --> 30:51.040
they want to report your friend.
They want to know his name.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.874
He's not my friend.
I just know he's called H.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.499
Are you defending him?
How long have you known him?

30:57.708 --> 31:00.874
The only thing I know
is his nickname!

31:01.750 --> 31:03.624
You know his name, tell them!

31:03.958 --> 31:07.915
- Do you think I'm a telltale?
- You told me his name.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.874
Daniela, his name.

31:12.875 --> 31:15.499
Hugo Olivera.
That's his name, dad.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.207
Call them, and say
Babi had nothing to do with it.

31:20.375 --> 31:23.082
Great, Babi, you've really
put your foot in it!

31:23.291 --> 31:24.207
Daniela...

31:27.916 --> 31:29.499
My parents are out.

31:30.375 --> 31:31.540
Yes, she's here.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.957
But I reckon that in a week
she'll be dead.

31:36.166 --> 31:39.249
She informed on a dangerous guy,
and she likes him.

31:39.458 --> 31:41.832
Stop talking about me
and hang up.

31:42.041 --> 31:44.040
Wait, I've got another call.

31:45.125 --> 31:46.290
Yes?

31:47.875 --> 31:49.624
Yes, just a minute.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.415
It's for you.

31:53.416 --> 31:54.457
Yes?

31:56.458 --> 31:58.582
Good evening!
Yes.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.790
Katina? She's sleeping.

32:03.541 --> 32:04.957
Shall I wake her?

32:07.458 --> 32:09.624
Yes, I'll tell her.

32:09.833 --> 32:10.582
Good night.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.290
Bye.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.540
What's going on?

32:15.916 --> 32:17.957
What is it?
Who was that?

32:18.166 --> 32:19.457
It's turned off.

32:19.958 --> 32:21.665
Where are the bike races?

32:21.875 --> 32:24.040
The Siamese races?
At the port.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.207
- Can I go? Please...
- No way.

32:26.416 --> 32:27.832
And don't tell anyone.

32:32.750 --> 32:33.874
Know where my sister's going?

32:51.416 --> 32:53.624
WE REMEMBER YOU

33:12.458 --> 33:13.915
No, stop, Pollo!

33:20.541 --> 33:23.332
What a surprise!
I'm so glad you've come!

33:23.541 --> 33:25.790
Why is your phone off?
Your mother rang.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.915
- What did you tell her?
- That you were asleep,

33:29.125 --> 33:30.499
and she believed me.

33:30.708 --> 33:34.040
She's picking you up tomorrow
at 7:00 for your blood tests.

33:34.250 --> 33:37.040
Don't be late,
I don't want any problems.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.415
- Come on, stay!
- No!

33:38.625 --> 33:40.082
We're going for a pizza.

33:40.291 --> 33:42.290
I doubt I'd eat
the pizzas you eat.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.165
Well, it's the untamed shrew!

33:46.375 --> 33:48.332
Have you come to see me race?

33:49.125 --> 33:51.040
I didn't even know
you were here.

33:51.250 --> 33:53.374
Then why are you
red as a beetroot?

33:53.583 --> 33:54.915
You just make me laugh.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.290
- Yeah?
- Yes.

33:56.916 --> 33:59.040
You won't be so cocky in court.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.749
I said it was you who broke
Mr. Santamaría's nose.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.957
- You bitch!
- Take it easy.

34:06.916 --> 34:09.540
You could go to prison!

34:09.750 --> 34:12.123
That won't happen, OK?

34:15.708 --> 34:17.956
The day I'm up in court

34:18.208 --> 34:20.956
this nice girl will say
I did nothing. Know why?

34:21.833 --> 34:22.831
Why?

34:23.250 --> 34:27.415
By then you'll be so crazy about me
you'll do anything to save me.

34:29.583 --> 34:34.415
The race is starting!

34:36.000 --> 34:37.915
Want to ride behind me?

34:38.416 --> 34:39.790
Never.

34:42.083 --> 34:44.206
H, will you take me?

34:46.166 --> 34:47.040
Get on.

34:48.708 --> 34:50.540
Stop being scared
and you'll have fun.

34:51.625 --> 34:52.956
You don't even have a belt.

34:53.166 --> 34:56.415
This is just for Siamese.
So, race or fuck off.

34:56.625 --> 34:57.957
She's a real cow.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.874
- What did you say?
- I'm racing now.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.499
Well, then?

35:04.583 --> 35:05.874
Give me your belt.

35:06.291 --> 35:07.832
Babi, no!

35:12.541 --> 35:13.832
Shit, my scarf!

35:18.625 --> 35:19.832
Get on!

35:22.708 --> 35:24.374
Are you crazy?
Don't!

35:24.958 --> 35:26.957
I haven't got all day.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.290
Good luck!

36:33.416 --> 36:34.915
Belts off!

37:20.291 --> 37:21.790
Come on!

37:38.333 --> 37:39.915
Up! Up!

38:00.291 --> 38:01.665
Last lap!

38:11.291 --> 38:12.540
Chino!

38:39.125 --> 38:41.999
Stop! Stop!

38:46.458 --> 38:47.457
Shit!

39:02.750 --> 39:04.915
Forget the bike, help her!

39:06.958 --> 39:08.749
Don't move her!

39:08.958 --> 39:10.915
- Lift her up!
- Call an ambulance!

39:26.791 --> 39:28.540
Get on! Get on!

39:29.333 --> 39:31.457
The cameras!
Cover the license plate!

39:39.625 --> 39:41.540
Hide here!

39:42.333 --> 39:44.624
I'll pick you up
once I shake them off.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.249
Quick!

39:53.750 --> 39:55.165
Shit!

40:14.333 --> 40:15.540
I'm here.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.290
- Where?
- Here.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.749
Why are you in there?
Come out.

40:19.958 --> 40:21.915
There's a huge dog out there.

40:22.125 --> 40:23.582
There's no dog here.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.707
I still can't come out.

40:25.916 --> 40:27.124
Why?

40:27.416 --> 40:28.832
I'm embarrassed.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.790
Come out now or I'll leave.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.165
No, wait!

40:36.375 --> 40:37.540
Wait!

40:37.791 --> 40:38.665
What?

40:39.083 --> 40:41.124
Promise you won't laugh.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.665
I promise.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.290
What have you done, kid?

40:57.625 --> 41:00.124
- Are you covered in mud?
- It's manure.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.207
That's manure?

41:02.416 --> 41:05.874
I don't believe it!
This is too good to be true.

41:06.083 --> 41:08.832
I knew it.
Your promises are worthless.

41:09.125 --> 41:12.749
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm getting on the bike!

41:13.000 --> 41:14.499
Are you crazy?

41:14.750 --> 41:16.499
You're covered in shit.

41:17.166 --> 41:19.082
- You're joking, right?
- No.

41:23.333 --> 41:26.665
If you want,
you can wear my jacket.

41:27.458 --> 41:29.540
But first take off those clothes

41:29.750 --> 41:32.290
or you can't get on the bike.

41:34.291 --> 41:37.290
Fuck, this is disgusting!

41:37.833 --> 41:40.290
- Look, H...
- I like how that sounds.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.374
It's the first time
you've said my name.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.874
If you turn round

41:45.083 --> 41:47.832
I swear I'll jump on you
and cover you with manure.

41:48.083 --> 41:49.957
And I do keep my promises.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.290
Don't look!

41:52.500 --> 41:54.624
I've got no interest in looking.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.957
I'd appreciate it if you’d hurry.

42:05.583 --> 42:08.374
You're a filthy,
disgusting bastard!

42:08.583 --> 42:11.832
I didn't turn round, did I?
But you've got a great ass.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.457
I wish I'd rubbed the manure
in your face.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.624
Now I do hear a rabid dog.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.457
- Hurry up!
- Look!

42:19.166 --> 42:21.915
Lift your legs
or he'll bite you!

43:04.166 --> 43:05.624
Thank you for the lift.

43:07.458 --> 43:09.499
So I'll pick you up tomorrow.

43:09.708 --> 43:11.040
What time?

43:11.333 --> 43:13.624
Sure, and the police
can chase us again.

43:13.833 --> 43:14.999
Right.

43:49.958 --> 43:52.249
You were a very brave Siamese.

43:53.541 --> 43:55.290
Are you going to report me?

43:55.916 --> 43:56.540
- Yes.
- Yes?

43:57.708 --> 44:00.249
Really?
Do you swear?

44:19.541 --> 44:21.457
Oh, Babi, Babi!

44:21.791 --> 44:24.290
I'm a pig, an animal, a beast,

44:24.500 --> 44:26.082
but you'd let me kiss you.

44:26.291 --> 44:28.249
- You're inconsistent.
- And you're a bastard!

44:28.458 --> 44:31.874
You had your mouth open,
begging me to kiss you.

44:33.208 --> 44:35.915
Give me back my jacket right now.

44:38.166 --> 44:39.207
Hot lips,

44:39.666 --> 44:41.374
what about a good night kiss?

44:41.583 --> 44:42.999
Go to hell!

44:59.250 --> 45:00.957
I was really worried.

45:01.166 --> 45:03.874
Your mom thought I was you
and gave me a good night kiss.

45:04.083 --> 45:06.165
- What happened?
- It was H, wasn't it?

45:06.750 --> 45:08.374
He tore off your clothes.

45:08.875 --> 45:09.957
You'll wake mom.

45:10.166 --> 45:11.165
Well?

45:13.291 --> 45:14.499
I'm going to shower.

45:16.416 --> 45:17.999
She smells of shit.

45:26.708 --> 45:28.790
Sorry, the police were after me.

45:29.375 --> 45:32.749
Liar, I saw you go off
with that stuck-up little mouse.

45:53.875 --> 45:56.832
Illegal races cause disturbances
in the port area

46:05.125 --> 46:07.415
Throw it up to me!

46:07.708 --> 46:08.749
Come on!

46:22.791 --> 46:24.749
She raced as a Siamese

46:24.958 --> 46:26.874
and saved a girl
who had an accident.

46:27.083 --> 46:28.290
It's really wild.

46:28.500 --> 46:30.290
- Are you going out?
- No!

46:31.541 --> 46:32.624
Sure.

46:37.708 --> 46:40.290
Katina, not again.
I'm not going out.

46:43.875 --> 46:45.415
Look who's waiting for you

47:09.875 --> 47:12.624
Babi! You're seeing H,
aren't you?

47:13.375 --> 47:16.082
If mom and dad ask,
I'm studying at Katina's.

47:16.291 --> 47:17.415
OK.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.332
I'll be back by 11:00.

47:21.250 --> 47:22.790
I'm the hero's sister-in-law.

47:41.041 --> 47:42.082
H...

47:42.708 --> 47:43.957
Got a light?

47:49.375 --> 47:50.457
What's up?

47:50.666 --> 47:52.082
New projects.

47:52.583 --> 47:57.040
Good luck, I don't think that prude
will open her legs so easily.

48:00.833 --> 48:02.207
I'll call you, OK?

48:25.125 --> 48:26.415
Vodka with pineapple.

50:21.833 --> 50:23.124
Dogface.

50:24.750 --> 50:25.790
Brute.

51:13.625 --> 51:14.999
Mom, why are you still up?

51:18.958 --> 51:22.624
Why are you behaving
as if you weren't my daughter?

51:22.916 --> 51:24.082
It got late.

51:24.291 --> 51:25.582
Come here!

51:39.708 --> 51:42.749
- Were you drinking?
- You know I don't drink.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.957
What's that boy doing to you?

51:47.166 --> 51:51.332
- Is he making you do anything?
- Nothing I don't want to do.

51:54.625 --> 51:55.749
Is anything wrong?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.374
No, dad, I came home late,
that's all.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.499
I got his license plate.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.665
- Talk to him.
- They're just kids.

52:12.875 --> 52:15.415
Tell him if he doesn't leave
our daughter alone,

52:15.625 --> 52:17.374
he'll be in trouble!

52:31.375 --> 52:32.332
Is that you?

52:35.458 --> 52:36.582
I want to see you.

52:41.583 --> 52:44.540
I'm grounded.
I got caught coming home late.

52:46.958 --> 52:48.665
So it's not an urban legend.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.665
Nice girls who behave badly

52:51.875 --> 52:53.332
are still grounded.

52:55.708 --> 52:57.040
What'll we do tomorrow?

52:58.291 --> 52:59.499
Go off somewhere.

53:02.958 --> 53:05.582
Pick me up at the school gate
and take me away.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.874
I haven't been up that early

53:08.083 --> 53:09.290
for over a year.

53:09.500 --> 53:10.665
I might sleep in.

53:13.750 --> 53:15.207
I trust you, H.

53:16.625 --> 53:17.915
Good night.

53:19.458 --> 53:20.749
Bye, Babi.

53:24.458 --> 53:25.957
- Bye, Babi.
- Bye.

53:40.333 --> 53:42.040
Let's go inside.

53:42.375 --> 53:44.124
I can't. H is coming.

53:44.333 --> 53:45.999
- We're going off!
- What?

53:46.208 --> 53:47.749
You're going to screw!

53:48.333 --> 53:51.290
As your best friend,
I want all the details.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.457
You animal!

53:52.666 --> 53:54.457
No, I'm really excited.

53:54.666 --> 53:57.082
It's like I was
losing my virginity again.

53:59.833 --> 54:02.290
- There he is! Wish me luck.
- Lots of luck.

54:08.125 --> 54:10.290
Babi! Relax your pelvis.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.374
Hello.

54:42.500 --> 54:43.790
Look who's there.

54:48.125 --> 54:49.415
Hugo...

54:50.791 --> 54:51.790
Hugo, please.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.540
Hugo, stop, please!

54:55.666 --> 54:57.165
H, what is it?

54:57.375 --> 55:00.082
Hugo, please, don't!

55:13.041 --> 55:14.707
In physics?
A distinction, definitely.

55:16.041 --> 55:18.582
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

55:19.458 --> 55:20.957
No, I'll take a break later.

55:43.541 --> 55:45.290
Son of a bitch!

55:56.125 --> 55:56.832
Stop!

55:58.958 --> 55:59.624
Please, Hugo!

56:00.833 --> 56:01.665
Please, stop!

56:01.875 --> 56:02.999
H, please!

56:05.291 --> 56:06.374
Stop, Hugo!

56:07.583 --> 56:08.582
Stop!

56:12.458 --> 56:13.499
Are you crazy?

56:13.708 --> 56:15.332
You could have killed us!

56:15.583 --> 56:26.832
Stop!

56:28.375 --> 56:29.332
Stop, please!

56:29.541 --> 56:31.290
H! Stop, stop!

56:53.541 --> 56:54.915
Who was that woman?

57:00.166 --> 57:01.582
She was my mother.

57:18.458 --> 57:21.499
Your father and your brother
don't know?

57:23.000 --> 57:24.999
My father thinks
she's with her friends.

57:30.750 --> 57:32.582
Am I the only one who knows?

58:33.916 --> 58:35.124
Stop, stop!

58:36.875 --> 58:37.957
Why?

58:39.458 --> 58:41.124
We're out in the open.

58:43.708 --> 58:45.499
There's no one here.

58:59.375 --> 59:01.124
I said no.

59:05.166 --> 59:06.374
OK.

59:10.291 --> 59:11.582
Come here.

59:11.791 --> 59:12.790
Come on.

01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:44.707
Why did you bring me here?

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.040
Don't you like it?

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.540
My parents always brought us here
when we were little.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.540
See the house that's for sale?

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.374
Yes.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:57.874
My sister and I
pretended it was ours.

01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:01.999
We used to see the owners
and we imagined we were them.

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.082
It's so sad.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:16.874
It's like we can
never enjoy it again.

01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:21.124
I knew you'd like it.

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.707
The jacket suits you.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:39.165
Who's calling?

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.957
My mother doesn't trust me.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:47.332
Or rather, you.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:27.874
Is that like mom's signature?

01:02:28.958 --> 01:02:30.624
I think it's perfect.

01:02:30.833 --> 01:02:32.790
- Thank you for helping me.
- Not at all.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.290
Don't go yet,
come and meet my daughters.

01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:36.915
Girls,

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:41.999
this is Gustavo,
our new upstairs neighbor.

01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:44.790
- Yes, we've seen each other.
- Yes.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.040
He doesn't know anyone,
I said you could take him out

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.665
and introduce him.

01:02:50.875 --> 01:02:52.415
Yes, mom, but not tonight.

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:55.374
The girls have asked me
to go to the cinema

01:02:55.666 --> 01:02:58.165
and as I'm not grounded anymore
I can go, can't I?

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.582
I have to go.
My pleasure.

01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:03.999
Likewise.

01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:06.207
Ciao.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:09.790
This weekend, if I can,
I'll call him.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:19.124
That hunk is walking
into the lion's den.

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.082
You, "Hello, Kitty".

01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.207
This is yours, right?

01:04:19.416 --> 01:04:21.207
You wouldn't have
such good taste.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.040
The other night, H used it
to tie me to the bed.

01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:26.540
It's strong.

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:28.249
Not strong enough
if you’re here.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:29.499
Poor thing.

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:32.415
You thought he'd promise you
eternal love, eh?

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:35.915
I feel sorry for you.

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:38.415
It's obvious
you're crazy about him.

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:43.040
Give me the scarf!
Give it to me!

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.457
- Let go!
- Give it to me!

01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:46.040
- Get off!
- Let go of me!

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:47.582
- Stop it!
- Give me the scarf!

01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:49.332
Let go, you bitch!

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:54.124
Hit her, Babi!

01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:02.832
Hit her, Babi, go on!

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.540
Hit her harder!

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:15.082
H!

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:17.165
Shit, it's Babi!

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.165
Let go of me!

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:33.082
The next time, I'll kill you,
you whore!

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:49.207
I don't know what happened me.

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.624
I didn't want to hurt her.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.374
- She said you'd been with her...
- Babi, Babi...

01:05:59.791 --> 01:06:01.790
I won't cheat on you
or hurt you.

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.207
I'm with you now.

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:10.165
With the girl who'll beat up
anyone who insults her guy.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.665
You know what warriors do
after their first victory in battle?

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:17.832
Hugo...

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:21.499
Someone wants a word with you.

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:26.665
I'm Claudio Alcázar,
Babi's father.

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:31.832
- Shall we go down for a drink?
- Yes, of course.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:33.832
Hugo,

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.249
we have to talk.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.499
- H, won't you introduce me?
- Of course.

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:45.665
Rosanna, Claudio.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:46.665
Claudio, Rosanna.

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.540
- My pleasure.
- Likewise.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:53.165
Sweetheart,
you want olives or nuts?

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:55.665
Olives.

01:07:58.583 --> 01:08:00.040
She liked you.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:01.874
She doesn't offer nuts
to everyone.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.874
- No?
- No.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.332
I don't really know
where to begin.

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:09.707
You see,

01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:11.332
my wife...

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:15.332
Olives for the best looking man
to come in here this year.

01:08:16.707 --> 01:08:17.624
Married, of course.

01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:23.290
Claudio,

01:08:25.207 --> 01:08:28.374
I understand
that your wife is concerned.

01:08:29.707 --> 01:08:32.165
Her daughter is with a guy
who rides a motorbike,

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:34.374
racing around at 100 m.p.h.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.332
because I don't want
to see things.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.749
But suddenly

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:43.707
someone appears and says
"Calm down",

01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:45.665
"ease up".

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:50.124
And when you ease up
you become aware of things.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:55.540
That there's a dance trophy
among the bottles of tequila.

01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.540
That my favorite song is playing.

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:00.582
That today is Tuesday 13th.

01:09:00.875 --> 01:09:04.624
And that Rosanna would run away
with you right now

01:09:04.832 --> 01:09:06.332
to the ends of the earth.

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:08.624
Little things, Claudio.

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:11.665
Your daughter is easing me up.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.082
And that's good for me.

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:26.332
Not now, Alex.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:29.790
What wrong with you? Didn't you
understand about prison?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.332
You can’t just do as you wish.
I'm sick of being your nursemaid!

01:09:33.582 --> 01:09:36.249
Stop messing around
and behave like an adult!

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:40.457
And what's that?

01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:44.624
Being old at 30 and not knowing
how to enjoy life? Tell me!

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:52.874
I'm sorry.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.749
- María Avellán.
- Present.

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:08.374
- Babi Alcázar.
- Present.

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:10.499
Irene Catur...

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.374
Here you are.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.374
Miss Alcázar!

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:19.165
Did your mother sign this?

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:20.665
Yes.

01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:22.624
It's odd.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.582
I’ve just spoken to her
and she didn't know you were ill.

01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:30.957
Nor that you were absent
on Friday.

01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:33.665
She's on her way.

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:36.874
You know that what you've done

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:39.915
means immediate expulsion
from this school?

01:10:43.625 --> 01:10:46.165
- Did they expel me, mom?
- No,

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:49.707
because we've donated 8,000 euros
to the school.

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:52.457
- Mom, I promise...
- Be quiet, please!

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:54.749
Stop making a fool of me.

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:56.957
When did you decide
to laugh at me?

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.374
I don't know you, Babi.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:02.082
- Babi, what's wrong?
- Stay away, Katina.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.707
And don't call!

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.374
She's in on it too, isn't she?

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:08.249
It's time you stopped seeing her.

01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.957
Katina said the teacher
is screwing you around.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.124
They tried to expel me.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.374
My parents paid a lot of money
to avoid it.

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.790
They're going to lower my grades.

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.374
I mightn't get into college.

01:11:40.625 --> 01:11:42.790
Are you crazy?
You'll wake my parents!

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.165
Come on.

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:46.874
I'm not climbing down there.

01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:48.624
- I'm scared.
- Scared?

01:11:48.833 --> 01:11:50.749
You're brave.
Come on.

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:52.665
- No!
- Come on.

01:11:58.333 --> 01:11:59.874
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.957
Trust me, Babi.

01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:07.165
- Hey, Pollo!
- Look who's here!

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.249
- Great!
- I didn't expect you.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:12.290
- I told you.
- I bet 20 euros I didn't have.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.915
Get in the water!

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:15.749
- I haven't got a costume.
- Come on.

01:12:16.083 --> 01:12:17.082
No, H...

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.332
I've thrown you in before.

01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:20.665
Stop...

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:21.874
No!

01:12:22.083 --> 01:12:23.415
Come on, it's great!

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.999
Save me, Babi!

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:29.290
- Come on, you two!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:34.332
Stop! Stop, please!

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.832
I have to tell you something.

01:13:21.958 --> 01:13:23.290
I'm nervous.

01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:26.790
Why?

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:30.124
I've never done it.

01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:35.874
Me neither.

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:40.582
Liar!

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:44.332
Babi! This lunatic just
asked me to marry him!

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:16.999
I'm not in a hurry, Babi.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.957
You can't smoke here.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:48.207
I'll be brief.

01:14:49.541 --> 01:14:50.957
From now on,

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:53.374
you'll treat
one pupil very well.

01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:55.999
If I hear that Babi

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.582
has any problem
because of you

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:01.082
you're in trouble.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:04.207
Don't waste your time
threatening me.

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.457
You're not the first.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:11.707
I'll just say one thing.

01:15:13.916 --> 01:15:15.207
Listen carefully.

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:18.915
Pepito.

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:20.332
Pepito!

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:22.665
Fetch the ball!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.082
Pepito!

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:25.624
The fucking ball!

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:28.415
This dog must have a trauma.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:31.415
Like my aunt's dog,
it thinks it's a rabbit.

01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:40.540
What's that thing?

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.957
No insults!

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:44.874
He's Pepito,
and he's a slow learner.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.999
We bought him between us.

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:48.624
- Who has custody?
- Pollo.

01:15:48.833 --> 01:15:50.749
- But he's staying with his mom.
- What?

01:15:53.958 --> 01:15:56.082
- Don't leave him here!
- Better take him out

01:15:56.291 --> 01:15:58.207
or he'll piss on the carpet.

01:15:58.416 --> 01:15:59.665
Bye, Alex.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.749
What's wrong?

01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:14.124
If mom hears you're smoking in here,
she'll slice you up.

01:16:15.541 --> 01:16:17.915
But I won't say a word.

01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:22.624
Shall we go see a movie?

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:26.249
I thought everyone knew
I'm grounded for life.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:31.665
We'd planned to sleep over
at Katina's and now I can't go.

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:36.124
Go on, and have fun.

01:16:38.625 --> 01:16:39.999
And mom?

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:41.790
I'll take care of that.

01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:52.165
I love the smell of a pipe.
It reminds me of when I was little.

01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:04.915
- Hi!
- Hi!

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:51.207
FOR SALE

01:17:57.416 --> 01:17:59.707
Wait here,
and don't look.

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.624
I hear the sea!

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:13.415
What was that?

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.999
Come here.

01:18:24.416 --> 01:18:25.915
There's a step, careful.

01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:31.957
More steps.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:37.207
Where are we going?

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.915
I can smell it now.

01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:48.249
The sea!

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:07.582
Like it?

01:19:12.291 --> 01:19:13.374
Well?

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.832
I never want this to end.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.874
This is incredible.

01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:46.874
It was your house, right?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.540
I've bought it back for you.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:50.915
You're crazy!

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:53.332
Now we're the owners.

01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:13.165
Are you all right?

01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:15.124
What do you think?

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.624
Do you want me to be the first?

01:20:19.666 --> 01:20:20.999
And the last.

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:23.415
Don't laugh.

01:21:23.833 --> 01:21:25.624
Relax, my love.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.624
Relax.

01:21:49.833 --> 01:21:51.165
I love you, Babi.

01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:34.790
Are you all right?

01:22:36.416 --> 01:22:38.374
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:41.915
I'm not very good, am I?

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.874
You're perfect.

01:22:46.708 --> 01:22:48.957
You made me feel great.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:50.749
I'm happy.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.124
I'm happier.

01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:53.957
No, I'm much happier.

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:57.874
- From here to Barcelona.
- From here to the sky.

01:22:58.083 --> 01:22:59.415
Well, I'm even happier.

01:22:59.625 --> 01:23:00.915
How much?

01:23:03.666 --> 01:23:05.415
Three meters above the sky.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.082
Good morning!

01:24:08.250 --> 01:24:09.915
Why is she babysitting?

01:24:10.666 --> 01:24:11.874
Rich kids don't work.

01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:14.790
Her mother has stopped
her allowance.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.040
Why did you bring Pepito?

01:24:17.708 --> 01:24:20.790
He doesn't like being alone.
It upsets him.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.707
No, it upsets you.

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:28.040
We mustn't be apart!

01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:31.957
Hi!

01:24:33.083 --> 01:24:34.790
You brought Pollo and the dog?

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.499
He can look after the kid.

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:40.582
Hey, champ.

01:24:41.291 --> 01:24:42.499
You're playing tennis!

01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:44.040
Get Pepito off the couch!

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.832
- He's called Pepito?
- Yes, he is.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.999
And I'm Pollo.
What's your name?

01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:51.540
Show me your favorite part
of the house.

01:24:53.083 --> 01:24:55.499
Come on,
or are you scared of me?

01:24:56.708 --> 01:24:58.499
Come on, hit it hard.

01:25:02.125 --> 01:25:04.582
- Let's go to your parents' room.
- No, come in.

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:08.832
Sit down.

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.957
- May I?
- Yes.

01:25:49.166 --> 01:25:52.082
- What was that?
- Don't worry, Pollo's in charge.

01:25:52.291 --> 01:25:53.957
That's what worries me.

01:26:03.083 --> 01:26:06.249
Who the hell do you think you are?
A friend of mine?

01:26:06.458 --> 01:26:09.499
- I'm sorry, Babi.
- Get this rabble out of here.

01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:11.415
- Get out!
- Everyone, out of here.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:14.582
Get the fuck out!
What were you doing, Pollo?

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:16.999
I'm sorry.

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.957
Parties here don't last long.

01:26:19.166 --> 01:26:20.915
What are they doing here?

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:23.790
You get out too.
I don't want to see you.

01:26:24.625 --> 01:26:25.915
Get out!

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:27.665
You lot don't respect anything!

01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:29.915
Babi, this isn't my fault!

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.249
Get out!

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.040
Hi, this is Babi.
Leave a message.

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:16.832
YOU AND I
3 M A S

01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:44.374
OK, the meat should be rare
with a little salt.

01:27:44.708 --> 01:27:46.415
- A little salt.
- And the strawberries?

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.499
They're in the fridge.

01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:50.124
No, that's wrong!

01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:54.874
Add the cream
just before you serve them.

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:58.040
And light the candles
five minutes before she arrives.

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.790
- Five minutes.
- Right.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.207
- Why not apologize over the phone?
- The dog!

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:04.915
You're so unromantic!

01:28:05.208 --> 01:28:07.540
She's due at 8:00,
but she's always 10 minutes early.

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:10.249
OK.

01:28:37.333 --> 01:28:38.540
- Yes?
- Hello.

01:28:40.583 --> 01:28:42.749
Babi, supper's getting cold.

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:45.707
Mom's looking all over
for a ring her mother gave her.

01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:48.165
It's been missing
since your friends were here.

01:28:48.583 --> 01:28:51.499
Is it always going
to be like this with you?

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.790
- No, Babi.
- Leave me alone.

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:25.915
Chino...

01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:28.332
Watch it!

01:29:29.708 --> 01:29:31.582
I don't want any problems.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:36.624
You don't want any problems?

01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:38.707
Tough guy.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:43.040
Don't touch me!

01:29:43.666 --> 01:29:44.999
Look at him.

01:29:45.208 --> 01:29:46.665
He wants a fight.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.040
I just want the ring.

01:30:15.041 --> 01:30:17.999
H, stop, please!
Stop, you'll fucking kill him!

01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:20.874
I've got the ring!
I've got it!

01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:40.665
- H, go away, please!
- Tell Babi to let me in!

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:43.124
She isn't here!

01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:45.124
It's H! What'll I do?

01:30:45.375 --> 01:30:47.707
My parents will be here soon!
Go away!

01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:49.082
Let me in, Babi!

01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:53.165
- I'll call the police.
- I have to give you something.

01:31:25.625 --> 01:31:26.749
Why are you crying?

01:31:40.666 --> 01:31:41.832
Miss Alcázar,

01:31:43.208 --> 01:31:46.207
can you tell us
what happened that night?

01:31:49.958 --> 01:31:51.874
Miss Alcázar, did you hear me?

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:56.124
Can you tell us
what happened that night?

01:32:12.083 --> 01:32:13.540
Babi! Wait!

01:32:18.916 --> 01:32:21.499
Why are you humiliating our family?

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:26.040
What will they think of us?
We promised we'd help them!

01:32:26.250 --> 01:32:28.290
No, you promised, I didn't.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:32.165
Stop being ashamed for me,
stop deciding for me.

01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:36.290
I refuse to grow old
and realize I've become like you.

01:32:38.166 --> 01:32:40.124
I won't live your lousy life.

01:32:41.458 --> 01:32:44.582
H is my boyfriend
and I want to be with him.

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:11.415
I won't lie for you again.

01:33:11.791 --> 01:33:12.957
You hear?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.749
If you keep doing as you please,
we're through, I swear.

01:33:19.791 --> 01:33:21.165
Very well.

01:33:22.125 --> 01:33:23.124
I'll change.

01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:41.499
They've passed!

01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:43.290
I passed!

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:46.040
Be quick,
we've got something to do.

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:49.290
I got the best grade!

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:54.207
Forga gave me an 8.
I thought she'd fail me.

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:55.915
I'm proud of you.

01:33:58.125 --> 01:33:59.415
We have to go.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.165
- Where?
- Pollo!

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.790
- Come on, Pollo!
- Behave yourself, Pepito.

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:13.207
Don't gulp your food.
You know it makes you sick.

01:34:15.541 --> 01:34:17.749
He doesn't want
to go back to the witch.

01:34:17.958 --> 01:34:18.957
Who is it?

01:34:19.208 --> 01:34:20.665
Pepito Delivery Service.

01:34:21.458 --> 01:34:24.415
And don't dare treat him
like you treat your pupils.

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:25.415
You hear?

01:34:25.625 --> 01:34:27.165
Move, Al Capone!

01:34:31.208 --> 01:34:32.290
So long, buddy.

01:34:33.416 --> 01:34:35.582
There'll be more than 100 of us.

01:34:36.208 --> 01:34:39.207
No, not a private room,
the whole restaurant.

01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:42.457
Yes, a very special occasion.

01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:44.915
Not just her good grades.

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:47.665
A daughter doesn't
turn 18 every day.

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:50.832
I'll send the guest list
this afternoon.

01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:53.040
- Mom...
- Yes?

01:34:53.458 --> 01:34:55.040
In case you'd forgotten,

01:34:55.666 --> 01:34:57.249
Hugo Olivera, my boyfriend.

01:35:08.041 --> 01:35:09.957
- Hi, Laura! Did you pass?
- Yes.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:16.874
Come in.

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:19.957
Good morning.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:22.582
I wanted to thank you...

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:27.374
Pepito?

01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:49.290
I want to marry her.

01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:51.749
First you need a job.

01:35:52.125 --> 01:35:56.624
Or will she go on paying
for everything, like she does now.

01:35:56.833 --> 01:35:58.707
Tomorrow, I'm going to win.

01:35:59.583 --> 01:36:00.915
So she can see me do it.

01:36:03.875 --> 01:36:05.457
Our girls are incredible.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.249
We have to live up to them.

01:36:09.958 --> 01:36:11.165
She'll love it.

01:36:15.583 --> 01:36:17.582
- I'll get it.
- H...

01:36:19.708 --> 01:36:21.374
Promise you'll be there.

01:36:22.041 --> 01:36:23.124
What do you think?

01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:40.415
Pollo...

01:36:49.375 --> 01:36:51.374
It's Babi!
Here, take this.

01:36:52.875 --> 01:36:53.790
Hello.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:55.582
Can we talk?

01:36:57.416 --> 01:36:58.332
Sure.

01:36:58.541 --> 01:37:00.165
You threatened my teacher!

01:37:01.666 --> 01:37:03.040
Are you stupid?

01:37:04.875 --> 01:37:06.249
You screwed me, H.

01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:10.874
- I thought that if...
- Stop thinking for me!

01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:14.082
Don't treat me like a moron.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.165
Let's leave it for a while.

01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.957
- Shall I say anything to him?
- No.

01:37:49.458 --> 01:37:51.665
I'll be along after the race, OK?

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.915
The dopey upstairs neighbor,

01:38:08.125 --> 01:38:09.707
he'll take us to the party.

01:38:18.291 --> 01:38:19.957
You're a fucking genius.

01:38:22.333 --> 01:38:23.290
Come on.

01:39:08.833 --> 01:39:11.040
- Have you seen H?
- No, I haven't.

01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:39.249
Babi,

01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:40.957
come here a moment.

01:39:44.541 --> 01:39:45.540
Carlos,

01:39:45.791 --> 01:39:46.749
this is Babi.

01:39:46.958 --> 01:39:48.457
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

01:39:52.541 --> 01:39:53.832
My love.

01:39:54.125 --> 01:39:55.332
A photo.

01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:03.290
What would happen
if I asked your sister out?

01:40:03.708 --> 01:40:07.499
Her boyfriend would break
every bone in your body.

01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:08.999
That's all.

01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:10.624
Hi, dad!

01:40:11.416 --> 01:40:12.540
Hello.

01:40:26.208 --> 01:40:27.499
Hey, where's your buddy?

01:40:27.708 --> 01:40:29.624
I want some fucking revenge.

01:40:30.708 --> 01:40:31.957
I'm racing for him today.

01:42:48.166 --> 01:42:49.332
I love you.

01:43:09.666 --> 01:43:11.707
Who is our daughter dancing with?

01:43:13.125 --> 01:43:15.040
With a good boy, Rafaela.

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:28.332
Be careful!
Stop, stop!

01:44:35.208 --> 01:44:37.499
Forgive me, I'm sorry, Babi.

01:44:37.708 --> 01:44:39.957
It's all right, Gustavo.

01:44:47.916 --> 01:44:49.540
I said it's all right.
Leave me alone!

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:52.165
She told you twice
to leave her alone! Get out!

01:44:52.458 --> 01:44:54.624
I'm just trying to help her.

01:44:59.333 --> 01:45:00.749
What are you doing, H?

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:03.207
He didn't do it on purpose!

01:45:06.125 --> 01:45:07.415
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:45:08.375 --> 01:45:09.832
You think he meant to do it?

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.165
Yes?

01:45:27.125 --> 01:45:29.082
Come on.

01:45:29.958 --> 01:45:31.332
I'm sorry, Claudio.

01:45:59.583 --> 01:46:01.374
- Katina! What is it?
- Pollo.

01:46:01.916 --> 01:46:03.582
Where is he?
They won't tell me.

01:46:04.333 --> 01:46:05.624
Look for him, H.

01:46:05.875 --> 01:46:07.249
Please, I'm begging you.

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.749
Where is he?

01:46:17.875 --> 01:46:18.915
Over there.

01:46:25.916 --> 01:46:27.874
You can't get through.

01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:34.915
Calm down.

01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:37.957
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Pollo!

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:41.790
Let go of me!
He's my friend!

01:47:13.875 --> 01:47:15.915
H!
H, stop, please!

01:47:16.208 --> 01:47:18.249
Please! H!

01:47:42.583 --> 01:47:44.915
- Don't touch me!
- Listen.

01:47:45.125 --> 01:47:46.040
I can't take any more.

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:48.957
Your life is full of shit
and death and blood,

01:47:49.166 --> 01:47:50.624
you don't care about me.

01:47:50.833 --> 01:47:53.207
I do care,
and Babi, I swear that...

01:47:53.416 --> 01:47:56.415
Don't swear anything.
You don't care about anyone.

01:47:56.625 --> 01:47:58.040
Not me or your family
or your best friend.

01:47:58.250 --> 01:47:59.124
It's not my fault!

01:47:59.333 --> 01:48:00.582
- Yes, it is!
- It's not!

01:48:00.791 --> 01:48:02.207
Of course it is!

01:48:03.333 --> 01:48:06.624
You killed Pollo!
You killed him!

01:49:32.833 --> 01:49:35.124
There's always a moment
when the road forks.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.040
Each one goes off, thinking
the roads will come together again.

01:49:53.625 --> 01:49:54.665
Come in.

01:49:57.333 --> 01:50:00.040
You see the other person
getting smaller and smaller.

01:50:03.625 --> 01:50:04.999
That's all right.

01:50:05.666 --> 01:50:07.249
We're made for each other.

01:50:13.333 --> 01:50:14.915
She'll be there at the end.

01:50:17.833 --> 01:50:19.415
But at the end
only one thing happens.

01:50:28.125 --> 01:50:29.665
The fucking winter comes.

01:51:00.666 --> 01:51:03.540
Yes, yes. Don't keep on.
I'm eating well, Alex.

01:51:05.333 --> 01:51:07.290
There's someone at the door.
I'll call you later.

01:51:18.833 --> 01:51:20.207
Merry Christmas!

01:51:25.833 --> 01:51:27.624
Come in, please.

01:51:34.291 --> 01:51:37.249
I haven't been around much
these last months.

01:51:39.250 --> 01:51:40.790
I couldn't, I'm sorry.

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:43.915
Don't worry.

01:51:48.791 --> 01:51:50.582
Santa left this for you.

01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:14.165
I miss him so much, H.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:16.707
I can't...

01:52:17.125 --> 01:52:19.874
Sometimes I think
I'll never find anyone like him.

01:52:20.791 --> 01:52:22.457
No, no one like him.

01:52:24.666 --> 01:52:26.832
But you'll find someone
who'll make you happy.

01:52:30.125 --> 01:52:31.707
Have you spoken to Babi?

01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:37.332
Have you?

01:52:39.541 --> 01:52:42.124
We lost touch after the accident.

01:52:43.291 --> 01:52:45.082
I think she's with another crowd.

01:52:46.916 --> 01:52:49.415
And she's going out
with some guy.

01:52:52.958 --> 01:52:55.207
Maybe you should forget her.

01:53:00.375 --> 01:53:01.874
Want to stay for supper?

01:53:04.125 --> 01:53:05.124
I can't tonight.

01:53:05.791 --> 01:53:07.457
Some other day.

01:53:22.125 --> 01:53:23.290
Thank you.

01:53:28.291 --> 01:53:29.415
That's OK.

01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:11.207
Yes?

01:54:11.416 --> 01:54:12.415
Hello.

01:54:14.416 --> 01:54:15.415
Is Babi there?

01:54:16.625 --> 01:54:17.749
Just a minute.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:19.999
Bye, mom.

01:54:20.208 --> 01:54:21.374
Call me tomorrow.

01:54:22.416 --> 01:54:23.457
Take care of her.

01:54:23.666 --> 01:54:24.957
I will, Rafaela.

01:54:39.375 --> 01:54:40.540
Are you ready?

01:54:42.541 --> 01:54:44.165
We're leaving in five minutes.

01:55:28.291 --> 01:55:29.540
What are you doing here?

01:55:30.583 --> 01:55:32.749
- I locked myself out.
- OK, come on.

01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:37.499
What's wrong?

01:55:38.958 --> 01:55:40.082
Hugo, what's wrong?

01:55:42.291 --> 01:55:43.665
What's happened?

01:56:16.625 --> 01:56:19.582
Suddenly you realize
that everything is over.

01:56:22.083 --> 01:56:23.332
Really.

01:56:31.916 --> 01:56:33.290
I'm going away for a while.

01:56:35.875 --> 01:56:37.249
To London.

01:56:37.583 --> 01:56:38.915
To work.

01:56:44.375 --> 01:56:45.915
That's a good idea.

01:56:56.791 --> 01:56:58.457
I can't stay here.

01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:00.457
There's no going back.

01:57:01.625 --> 01:57:02.999
You feel it.

01:57:27.333 --> 01:57:30.832
And then you try to remember
at what point it all began.

01:57:32.291 --> 01:57:35.040
And you discover it started
before you thought.

01:57:35.666 --> 01:57:42.124
Hello.

01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:43.915
Long before.

01:57:47.125 --> 01:57:49.957
And it's at that moment

01:57:50.291 --> 01:57:53.165
you realize
things only happen once.

01:58:13.041 --> 01:58:16.999
And no matter how hard you try
you'll never feel the same again.

01:58:17.875 --> 01:58:21.707
You'll never again feel
you're three meters above the sky.

01:58:26.375 --> 01:58:30.082
THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY
