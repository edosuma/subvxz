39:25.720 --> 39:28.440
to me... quite rightly, to my mind...

39:30.040 --> 39:30.920
she said...

39:32.840 --> 39:34.480
"James, it's too cold in here."

I'm sorry, but you were.

He didn't really know what was happening.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.600
They told me, but they hadn't told him.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.360
I was on the chair beside the bed.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.080
He held out his hand.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.040
And I took it and I held onto it.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.640
And then he pulled on it.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.080
So I got onto the bed.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.600
And we stayed like that.

40:48.440 --> 40:51.600
It was uncomfortable because
I only had 10% or so of the bed.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.520
But any time I tried moving,

40:56.120 --> 40:57.600
tried to move away...

41:03.400 --> 41:04.920
he would take my hand again.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.600
There was a beeping sound.

41:12.520 --> 41:13.640
And then a rush.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.360
A rush of people.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.000
They had to unfurl his fingers
to free mine.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.160
And then they asked me to wait,
to wait outside, out of the way.

41:29.720 --> 41:33.200
And I watched them pull the curtain
all the way around his bed.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.840
What was it like coming home again?

41:39.800 --> 41:41.120
Having to come back home?

It was the skin.

Getting back into bed.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.600
Once we were back into bed...

42:04.000 --> 42:05.160
it was the way it felt.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.000
I realize it's probably completely
and utterly--

42:13.480 --> 42:16.160
But you were in the middle of the--

42:19.480 --> 42:21.280
You were there and you were cold.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.920
And for the briefest moment,
I thought to myself...

42:27.960 --> 42:29.400
"Now he's gone too."

-How are you?
-Can't complain.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.080
Well, actually,
that's not strictly speaking true.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.360
I probably could.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.040
So how have you been...

43:43.720 --> 43:45.240
doing since the accident?

43:45.880 --> 43:46.720
I mean.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.280
-Yes.
-Looked like a real humdinger.

43:49.400 --> 43:54.600
Yes, my hip was quite badly,
collarbone, coccyx.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.280

44:00.480 --> 44:02.040
Do you remember much about it?

44:03.320 --> 44:04.560
Bits and pieces.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Because I was pretty hysterical
at one point.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.520
Oh, really?

44:09.240 --> 44:10.600
I thought you were dead.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.240
Thought I'd killed you with my bare eyes.

44:13.400 --> 44:17.440
And then one of the other people there,
she took your pulse

44:17.520 --> 44:19.360
and you were definitely alive.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.200
I can confirm I am indeed alive.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.680
You kept asking for Alan.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.080

44:39.640 --> 44:40.560
No,  but I'd love to.

44:40.640 --> 44:42.680
But I might be shit, for all you know.

Emily.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.480
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to ask how you are.

44:58.960 --> 45:00.880
You already did that, didn't you?

45:05.360 --> 45:07.480
People keep trying to send me on dates.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.440
Get back out there.

45:13.640 --> 45:15.120
The hardest thing, I think...

45:16.200 --> 45:19.440
for sure is working out the...

45:22.960 --> 45:24.720
most effective way to miss him.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.760
Forgetting him altogether seems cruel.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.480
Fuck me, does remembering hurt!

45:43.720 --> 45:46.560
No one knows, but I talk to him sometimes.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.800
When it's really bad.

45:49.360 --> 45:50.240
At night.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.160
I sometimes talk to my mum.

45:56.440 --> 45:57.520
What sort of things?

45:59.520 --> 46:00.480
It varies.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.800
Does it get any easier?

46:05.240 --> 46:08.800
Because they say, don't they?
People love telling you that it does.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.280
They do.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.160
But not you.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.680
So, how do you cope?

46:23.640 --> 46:24.480
Probably not...

46:24.800 --> 46:26.040
not very effectively.

46:28.640 --> 46:32.320
I had it in my head that all therapists
must lead really sorted lives.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.880
Therapists are all fruitcakes.

46:43.400 --> 46:45.440
I am so, so sorry, Emily.

46:47.160 --> 46:48.040
I really am.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.520
Thank you.

48:29.880 --> 48:30.720
Hello.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.200
Hi, it's me.

48:34.520 --> 48:35.360
It's Joy.

48:37.000 --> 48:37.840
Hi.

48:39.120 --> 48:39.960
How are you?

48:41.280 --> 48:42.440
Yeah. Ticking along.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.160
How about the--
How are things with you?

48:49.640 --> 48:53.520
A certain degree of ticking along also.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.280
Actually, that might not be strictly true.

48:59.320 --> 49:01.000
I'm staying with Neil, Joy.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.000
Well, Neil and his brother.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.760
I didn't realize.

49:08.920 --> 49:10.200
<i>No reason why you should.</i>

49:15.560 --> 49:17.080
Where are you right now?

49:18.640 --> 49:19.520
I'm at the house.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.400
That's nice.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.560
How's the boiler holding up?

49:29.200 --> 49:31.520
All quiet on the western front.

49:32.200 --> 49:33.200
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

49:35.440 --> 49:37.600
And the radiator? In the hallway?

49:38.480 --> 49:42.520
Yeah, someone's coming
to take a look at it, a week tomorrow.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.760
How about that pesky cupboard door?

49:47.680 --> 49:49.320
How you doing clothes-wise?

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
A little on the low side.

49:56.720 --> 49:57.560
Alan...

49:59.920 --> 50:01.480
I have a confession to make.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.720
<i>I'm wearing one of your jumpers.</i>

50:06.520 --> 50:07.560
Which one?

50:08.960 --> 50:12.880
The woolly one
with the hole in the armpit.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.120
Quality bit of kit.

50:20.480 --> 50:21.320
<i>I...</i>

50:23.840 --> 50:26.680
I keep rereading all your...

50:28.360 --> 50:30.960
all our old text messages.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.640
Last night, I put my nose
and then my cheek

50:38.240 --> 50:40.800
right up against the books
on your bedside table.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.680
I called the house
when I knew you'd be out

50:45.760 --> 50:48.400
just so I could hear your voice
on the answering machine.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.240
Twice.

50:58.640 --> 51:00.000
Joy,  I miss you.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.440
I'm so, so...

51:07.480 --> 51:09.280
unbelievably sorry, Joy.

51:15.720 --> 51:17.760
So how...

51:20.800 --> 51:23.920
dire, and don't hold back,
is the situation really?

51:24.960 --> 51:25.800
<i>Clothes-wise.</i>

51:26.480 --> 51:27.560
Oh, it's bad.

51:30.320 --> 51:33.600
Yeah, I'm turning things inside out,
if you catch my drift.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.480
Sorry to hear that.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.440
I miss you too, by the way.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.760
Joy, I'd love the chance to see you.

52:19.920 --> 52:20.880
You must be Alan.

52:22.400 --> 52:23.240
Joy.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.160
Nice to meet you.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.360
Hello, Joy.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.800
It's nice to meet you, too.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.920
I was told to give you this.

52:43.440 --> 52:44.400
Well, thank you.

52:55.880 --> 52:56.760
