00:06.107 --> 00:07.575
<i>Arkady,
I really need to talk to you.</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:10.078
You'd have to
call me Papa.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.945
My dad's gotten to the point
where he can't live alone.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.847
You're buying a house so that
your dad can move in with you?

00:13.981 --> 00:15.349
Yeah.
And he's okay with that?

00:15.483 --> 00:16.984
Haven't told him yet.
Getting the house first.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.254
Is that for us?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.989
I'm a federal agent.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.757
Where's your badge?
I don't have it.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.526
We didn't do anything wrong.

00:25.659 --> 00:26.994
You're not cooperating.
Put your hands up!
I'm...

00:27.128 --> 00:28.196
What are you talking ab... Ow!

00:28.329 --> 00:29.197
You're hurting her!
Stop moving!

00:30.030 --> 00:30.998
Hey.
Stop!

00:36.270 --> 00:37.638
You okay?
This is Rosa.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.773
I'm Elliot Reynolds,
Rosa's case manager.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.175
She's with family

00:41.309 --> 00:42.343
and has a good case for asylum.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
She gave one of
the other children

00:44.345 --> 00:45.313
something to pass along to you.

00:45.446 --> 00:46.380
Pilar?

00:46.514 --> 00:47.448
That's a <i>mu√±eca quitapena,</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:48.516
a worry doll.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.184
We make them in Guatemala.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.652
Rosa and I learned
we came from the same town

00:51.785 --> 00:53.154
and became friends.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.378
Fall back!

01:18.646 --> 01:19.913
Cover me!

01:57.785 --> 02:00.721
You doing okay, Dad?

02:00.854 --> 02:03.224
You know,

02:03.357 --> 02:06.860
your mother and I bought our
first and only house in, uh...

02:08.296 --> 02:09.397
Uh...

02:09.530 --> 02:10.864
1979.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.766
Ah!
Tha-that's right, that's right.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.769
She said that was one of the
happiest moments of her life.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.406
And I thought
we'd live there forever.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.709
Together.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.945
Yeah.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.914
I thought the same thing once.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.750
Too much house for one person.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.385
Hmm?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.786
Yeah.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.323
That coming from a man
who lives on a boat.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.658
Well...

02:37.791 --> 02:39.993
we don't live
on a boat anymore, Dad.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.500
You know, I can't imagine
what your mother would think.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.669
She would think it's time
to pass that house on

02:48.802 --> 02:50.504
to the next generation.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.006
The buyers have two kids.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.908
They'll enjoy growing up there,
just like I did.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.677
I think she'd get a kick
out of us living together.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.313
Yeah.
It'd make her happy.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.984
Yeah.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.321
I suppose.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.989
Mm.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.524
You need anything?

03:10.658 --> 03:12.526
No. I'm good.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.334
Yeah.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.771
Rosa.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.139
Hi. Hey.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.475
Hey.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.278
Hi. Hi.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.313
We came as soon as we could.
Are you okay?

03:37.685 --> 03:38.686
Okay?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.321
So, wh-what happened?

03:40.454 --> 03:43.291
Her aunt is quite elderly,
and she had a stroke.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.158
She's in hospice care,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.528
and without a family member
to support Rosa,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.797
it changes her status.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.465
Yeah, of course.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.334
Um, hey. Why don't we sit down?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.002
Come here. Come here.

03:55.135 --> 03:57.538
I don't understand.
How did they deny her asylum?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.407
I mean, she was almost killed
on the way here.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.874
Kensi was there with her, she
was damn near killed herself.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.576
By people in this country,

04:02.710 --> 04:04.177
not hers.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.747
They're going to send
me back, aren't they?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.716
We're gonna do everything
in our power to prevent that.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.818
Her friend Pilar's parents

04:10.918 --> 04:12.820
were both killed
by Guatemalan gangs.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.155
Yes, and Pilar has a case
for credible fear

04:15.255 --> 04:16.424
if she's returned.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.925
And even those
are tough to prove

04:18.058 --> 04:20.394
because the court
hears them all the time.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.062
Rosa came here on her own

04:22.195 --> 04:24.498
after her father disappeared
and her mother fell ill.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.168
I don't want to go back there, Kensi.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.937
I know, honey. I know.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.672
So, just to clarify, because her

04:31.772 --> 04:33.774
case isn't as tragic,
she gets sent back?

04:33.907 --> 04:34.842
I mean, come on,
her dad could've been murdered

04:34.942 --> 04:36.109
by the same gangs.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.078
Or he left
to start a new family.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.681
I'm sorry, but these
are the kind of things

04:40.781 --> 04:42.616
the court will consider
without hard evidence.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.217
Yeah, but how are we
supposed to find evidence

04:44.352 --> 04:45.553
when the country
is actively trying to cover up

04:45.686 --> 04:46.854
that they have a gang problem?

04:48.188 --> 04:49.289
I knew it was too good

04:49.423 --> 04:50.958
to be true.
No, Rosa.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.393
You are not going to give up,

04:52.526 --> 04:55.062
'cause we certainly aren't.
Right?

04:55.195 --> 04:57.698
We are going to find a way.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.100
Okay, okay. All right.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.735
So, we file an appeal,
and we put a motion

05:01.869 --> 05:04.204
to-to reopen the case.
We do a continuation that

05:04.304 --> 05:05.906
buys us time to find
the evidence. Does that work?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.941
We can certainly try.
All right,

05:08.075 --> 05:09.777
okay. So, how much time do we
have before they deport her?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.712
Well, due to
the number of migrants

05:11.812 --> 05:14.114
from her country, there are
weekly deportation flights

05:14.247 --> 05:15.115
back to Guatemala.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.217
I'm sorry, what? W-Weekly?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.252
I'll be right back.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.321
This is ridiculous.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.423
There-there has to be

05:22.556 --> 05:23.624
something else that we can do.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.792
I wish there was.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.059
Okay, so, what
are our options?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.895
We don't really
have any options.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.631
I mean, they could deport her
within the week.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.904
What if we adopt her?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.339
A-Adoption?
Yeah, I mean,

05:39.473 --> 05:40.808
through the orphan process
we could adopt her.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.410
Theoretically.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.445
W-We don't even know
where her father is,

05:44.578 --> 05:45.979
and there's no proof
that her mother died.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.482
You would have to prove
that she was actually

05:48.616 --> 05:50.350
an orphan, and even then...

05:50.484 --> 05:52.586
Yeah, but we can do that.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.987
Right?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.472
This from last night?

06:11.605 --> 06:12.973
Afraid so.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.844
Where the hell is everybody?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.379
Agent Blye and Investigator
Deeks got an emergency call

06:19.513 --> 06:22.950
from ORR about the refugee
they're helping seek asylum.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.052
Uh, Agent Hanna
is moving his father today,

06:25.185 --> 06:26.720
but he'll be in later.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.690
Agent Rountree and his sister
are giving their deposition

06:29.823 --> 06:31.692
about their recent run-in
with law enforcement.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.894
And Agent Namazi
is taking her mother

06:34.027 --> 06:35.696
to a medical appointment.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.064
Not sure where Agent Callen is.

06:37.197 --> 06:40.200
Probably some other
personal drama.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.503
Maybe we should just
shut down for the day

06:42.636 --> 06:44.805
for one great,
big family picnic.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.306
I make some mean deviled eggs.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.546
Get 'em on the horn, tell them
to get their asses in here

06:52.680 --> 06:55.215
before I am even grumpier
than usual.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.184
You're never grumpy, sir.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.752
You're just passionate.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.220
Keep it up, Dahr.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.156
I'll be sending you
back to Washington.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.325
In a mailing tube.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.539
Morning.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.107
What are you doing here?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.776
Looking for you.
Why? Is everything okay?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.578
You haven't answered
any of my calls.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.847
You called me?
Yeah, about a dozen times.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.348
Must be old phone number.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.850
It's the only number
that Anna and I have,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.284
and it was working
two weeks ago.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.920
Well, like I said,
old phone number.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.022
I change it every month
for security purposes.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.724
That really necessary?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.692
Well, apparently, it's working.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.093
Is Anna okay?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.695
She is okay, and
that's actually why I'm here.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.297
Do you mind if I...
Yeah, yeah, sit down.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.436
Okay, please tell me you're not
having vodka for breakfast.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.404
Of course not. It's nastoyka.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.541
Which is basically
flavored vodka.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.776
No, it's good for digestion.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.410
You want breakfast? Syrniki?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.712
Draniki? Zapekanka?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.813
No, no, I'm fine.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.114
Honestly.
Are you sure?

08:01.248 --> 08:02.883
Always so serious.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.552
You need to loosen up, Grisha.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
Stress kills.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.488
I'm not stressed.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.123
No, okay.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.426
I-It's like your head
is like thermometer.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.995
Uh, I don't even know
exactly what that means.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.897
And, by the way, since
when-when do you call me Grisha?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.331
That's your name, is it not?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.801
Or you prefer "G,"
one letter, like "Ye."

08:20.934 --> 08:22.836
"Ye" is two letters, but...

08:24.772 --> 08:25.906
How can I help you?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.576
It's about Anna.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.611
I thought you said she was okay.
She is.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.980
She's more than okay.
She is...

08:33.113 --> 08:34.948
She's amazing.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.450
And I love her.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.353
Ah...

08:40.487 --> 08:41.689
You need money.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.691
No. No.
No, it's okay.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.793
I mean, every now and then
people need help. How much?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.861
No. I don't need money.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.964
I'm gonna ask Anna to marry me.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.433
And I would like
your blessing.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.144
Seriously?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.146
Yes.
No, is terrible idea.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.548
Absolutely not. I forbid it.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.133
Hey.
How'd the deposition go?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.668
Okay.
Yeah?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.803
Yeah, part of me just wishes
all this would go away,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.672
but I know
if we don't do anything,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.874
nothing will ever change.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.744
Just wish Jordyn didn't have to
keep reliving it over and over.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.079
Well, she's a tough cookie,
just like her brother.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.481
Hmm. Never really saw myself
as a cookie.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.316
How's your mom?

09:43.416 --> 09:46.019
She has to get foot surgery,
but it's nothing serious.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.855
Just means she has to
ride around on one of

09:47.988 --> 09:49.990
those little scooters for
a while, you know, wear a boot.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.892
Oh, that sucks.
Oh, you have no idea.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.094
She's gonna be unbearable.

09:54.227 --> 09:57.264
Hey, guys, you might
want to take a look at this.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.232
Oh, is that the Navy base
from last night?

09:59.366 --> 10:01.534
Yep, at approximately
3:30 this morning,

10:01.669 --> 10:03.203
two men cut the perimeter fence

10:03.336 --> 10:04.672
and opened fire
on security lights.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.840
Then they detonated
an explosive device

10:06.940 --> 10:08.375
that left one of them dead

10:08.508 --> 10:09.877
and the other with
life-threatening injuries.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.212
He's in the burn unit
at Ventura Memorial.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.380
Any motive?

10:13.513 --> 10:15.248
Not yet.
They have identification?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.583
No, neither man was carrying ID,

10:16.717 --> 10:17.751
and we weren't able
to gather prints,

10:17.885 --> 10:19.519
due to their injuries.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.021
Well, what about their weapons?
Working on them, too,

10:21.121 --> 10:22.890
but there's a chance
they were ghost guns.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.557
Any vehicle?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.894
Nothing's been located
in the area.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.863
Either there was another player
that took off

10:29.963 --> 10:32.232
or there's a vehicle in the area
waiting to be discovered.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.867
Or they Ubered.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.370
<i>You're joking.
I'm being serious.</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:38.972
I am not joking.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.474
I cannot give you
my blessing.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.777
Is disaster waiting
to happen.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.213
Especially for you two.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.453
We love each other.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.256
So why ruin it?
Live together. Make baby.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.391
No, I cannot
recommend that, either.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.428
No. Sorry. Is best
for both of you.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.730
Because it didn't work for you?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.464
Doesn't work for anyone.
That's not true.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.801
Mostly, it is.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.503
You do realize this is just
a considerate gesture?

11:10.637 --> 11:11.772
We don't need your blessing
to get married.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.174
Of course you do.
Of course we don't.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.609
If not, then...

11:17.610 --> 11:18.979
Then what?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.613
<i>Brak budet proklyat.</i>

11:27.254 --> 11:28.989
The wedding will not be cursed.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.491
You should know more
about these things than anyone.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.460
Why should I know this?

11:33.593 --> 11:34.928
You're Romani.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.596
Who knows more about
curses than gypsies?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.866
Okay, well, aside from
being grossly inappropriate,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.968
that is ridiculous.
Says you.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.702
You don't believe me, ask Anna.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.172
She won't get married
without my blessing.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.341
Yes, she will.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.511
Want to bet?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.613
Enjoy your nastoyka.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.715
I will.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.121
You enjoy bachelorhood...

12:01.221 --> 12:03.824
<i>durachock.</i>

12:03.957 --> 12:05.893
I'll be there as soon as I can.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.460
All right, I'm getting
everything together.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.064
Have Callen meet me there.
All right, thanks.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.966
What do you think?

12:17.637 --> 12:19.840
Dad.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.509
I think it needs
some furniture.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.812
I don't know.
I think I like the space.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.679
My butt needs a comfy chair.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.317
Maybe a new recliner.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.919
Ah, now you're getting it.
One with a cup holder.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.821
Built-in heater, massage.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.488
You're mocking me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.257
I'm not mocking you.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.393
Yeah, but now that you said it,
I'll take nothing less.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.362
Got any beer?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.763
I made coffee.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.432
I don't drink caffeine.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.034
You're not supposed
to drink alcohol either.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.768
Nobody's supposed
to drink alcohol.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.437
It could interfere
with your meds.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.040
Well, God forbid I die happy.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.109
Look, I got to go to work,
all right?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.280
Um, on my way back home,
I'll grab some light beer.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.050
Light beer? My God, son,
what's this town done to you?

13:03.183 --> 13:05.085
You a Navy frogman,
for God's sake.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.287
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.589
Well, you want me
to come with you?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.727
No. Dad, I want you
to stay put.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.396
Do not go outside.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.564
What, I'm under house arrest?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.566
No, no.
More like house detention.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.434
Until Mrs. Ortiz gets here.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.071
Oh, you got me a babysitter.
She'll help
take care of the place.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.138
And me.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.040
If you need anything, yeah.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.109
How old is she?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.443
I don't know,
I didn't ask her.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.979
What's she look like?

13:32.112 --> 13:33.914
What difference does it make?
I'm just curious.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.416
I didn't find her on Tinder.
Well, maybe you should have.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.988
Call me if you need anything.
All right?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.990
I won't.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.092
Okay. Love you, too.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.563
<i>Yes, Shyla, yeah, no,
we're-we're heading in.</i>

13:50.663 --> 13:52.499
We'll see you in 20.
Okay, all right. Okay, bye.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.167
Ooh, Kilbride's on the warpath

13:54.301 --> 13:55.468
because no one showed up
to work today

13:55.602 --> 13:57.670
except for Rountree and Fatima. Oh.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.772
Ah.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.478
Were you serious back there?
About the adoption?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.613
Were you?

14:06.746 --> 14:07.847
I asked you first.
Yeah, but

14:07.981 --> 14:09.616
we answered the same time.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.119
What?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.753
I think Rosa needs our help.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.488
If she gets deported,

14:15.622 --> 14:17.157
God only knows
what'll happen to her.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.259
Well, nothing good,
that's for sure.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.262
And this may be our only way
to keep her safe. Hmm.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.763
I mean, here's the way
that I look at it.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.032
At the very least
it gives us time

14:25.165 --> 14:26.533
to bolster her asylum case,
right?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.468
Mm-hmm.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.137
But...
But...

14:30.270 --> 14:32.205
We could also end up

14:32.339 --> 14:35.442
adopting a child.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.210
She's not a child,
she's a young woman.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.811
She's a minor.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.880
But even after she turns 18,

14:41.014 --> 14:42.983
she's still
legally our daughter.

14:44.451 --> 14:48.221
Like, a living,
breathing human being

14:48.355 --> 14:50.123
that we are responsible for

14:50.223 --> 14:52.993
for the rest of our lives.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.797
You believe things happen
for a reason, right?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.732
I do.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.868
I think this is our reason.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.014
I'm a little confused here.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.848
What were these guys
trying to do?

15:15.983 --> 15:18.418
They were carrying IEDs,
so my first guess

15:18.551 --> 15:19.819
would be sabotage.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.921
But why?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.756
Who knows?

15:23.890 --> 15:25.758
Then again, maybe they were
trying to steal some weapons.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.494
IEDs were there
to cover their tracks?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.928
I mean, two guys on foot?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.263
How many weapons
did they think

15:30.397 --> 15:31.498
they could carry out of here?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.565
That's the thing,
is we don't know

15:32.699 --> 15:33.866
it was only two guys.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.169
So, yeah, they
had to have a vehicle.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.105
If we can't find that,
then that suggests

15:38.238 --> 15:40.940
there was at least one other
suspect, maybe even more.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.275
Well, hopefully,
their buddy who survived

15:42.409 --> 15:44.177
will have some answers for us.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.779
You'd think they would have
parked closer as well, you know?

15:46.913 --> 15:48.548
Have a quicker ratline
out of here.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.350
Well, PCH is close and fast.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.421
Yeah, but you're risking
too much oncoming traffic.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.923
Well, the base is surrounded
by agricultural land.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.091
Maybe, like, a farm vehicle

15:58.225 --> 15:59.792
wouldn't raise
too much suspicion?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.728
Especially if it was parked on
the other side of the highway.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.763
There are a lot of
campsites around.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.633
An RV could be a good choice.
That's true.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.701
Shyla's checking up
CHP cameras,

16:08.801 --> 16:10.103
see if we can find anything.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.871
Somebody's gonna claim
that body soon, too.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.074
We should ask the coroner to
let us know when they do.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.608
Yeah. Good call.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.590
Ah.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.425
I was kind of hoping
you decided to retire.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.294
Oh, you hoping for
my sake or for yours?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.329
Both.
I'm afraid you're
not that lucky.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.098
You get your dad
all settled in?

16:38.231 --> 16:41.000
Unfortunately.
That good, huh?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.170
Yeah, I think it's a fifty-fifty
chance that one of us will

16:43.303 --> 16:44.737
kill the other by the time
the week's out.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.274
Well, my money's on Raymond. Thanks.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.643
If it's any consolation,
I may be giving Arkady

16:50.777 --> 16:52.445
a little dirt nap as well.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.846
Yeah? What'd he do now?

16:53.980 --> 16:55.682
It's more what
he didn't do.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.517
I asked for his blessing
to marry Anna.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.419
You did? Wow.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.121
Congratulations, man.
It's about time.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.289
Yeah. He said no.

17:03.956 --> 17:04.824
What? Come on.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.326
I'm serious.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.095
He is forbidding me
to marry her.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.930
That's ridiculous. Why?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.532
He doesn't think
it's a good idea.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.101
Well, it's Arkady.
He's half crazy.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.203
Just half?
What did Anna say?

17:16.336 --> 17:17.837
I didn't tell her.
She won't care.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.439
She'll either laugh it off
or tear him a new one.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.707
Probably both.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.841
He said that the marriage
will be cursed

17:21.974 --> 17:23.543
if we don't have his blessing.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.011
But wh-what is that, Russian?
I've never even heard of that.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.446
You're asking me?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.847
Sic Anna on him.
She'll scare him straight.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.517
Excuse me. Federal agents
Callen, Hanna, NCIS.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.486
You called about the John Doe
who was brought in last night. Yes.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.455
Did he regain consciousness?
Afraid not.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.889
Can we see him?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.891
His lawyer said
he's to have no visitors.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.796
His lawyer?
He was identified?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.632
No.
Then how's he have a lawyer?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.500
I just know what I was told.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.537
Could be an ambulance chaser.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.405
Have you seen him around before?
No.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.674
He leave a name?
Let me check.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.544
If our boy hasn't
been identified,

17:57.677 --> 17:59.246
then no one's been
notified he's here.

17:59.379 --> 18:02.549
Well, if nobody knows he's here,
how does his lawyer show up?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.252
He left his card to call him
when is client wakes up.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.054
Jeremy Chambers, Esquire.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.723
Esquire. Fancy.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.559
Yeah, well, looks like
Mr. Esquire has

18:12.692 --> 18:13.860
some explaining to do.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.895
Thank you.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.508
Jeremy Chambers
is a partner with

18:28.608 --> 18:30.443
Meyers, Masters and Chambers.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.679
Chambers himself
is a bit of a specialist

18:32.779 --> 18:34.046
in civil liberty cases,

18:34.181 --> 18:35.748
especially those being
bankrolled by

18:35.882 --> 18:37.617
the NRA Civil Rights
Defense Fund.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.286
Sounds like Mr. Jeremy Chambers

18:39.419 --> 18:40.887
needs an invitation
to the boatshed.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.790
Will do.
How are Fatima and
Rountree making out?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.358
They haven't called anything in,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.926
and I'm still searching
through CHP cameras,

18:47.059 --> 18:48.861
but nothing so far.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.463
Hold on, I got something.

18:50.597 --> 18:51.931
Not a camera hit,

18:52.064 --> 18:53.466
but some family members
have identified

18:53.600 --> 18:55.268
our dead suspect in the morgue.

18:55.402 --> 18:56.903
Get a name. Send Kens and Deeks
down to speak with them

18:57.036 --> 18:58.104
and update the team.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.772
Apply for a warrant, too.
Have, uh,

18:59.906 --> 19:00.873
Fatima and Rountree
search his home and vehicles.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.041
You got it.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.145
So, your sis ever talk to Nate?

19:06.279 --> 19:09.081
She did, and, uh,
it really helped.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.450
Thank you for that.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.118
She was rock-solid
at the deposition.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.287
Hmm. What about you?

19:14.421 --> 19:17.257
I thought I did well.
With Nate.

19:18.791 --> 19:19.959
You didn't talk to him.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.628
Been very busy.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.231
Ah.
Busy with your super denial

19:24.331 --> 19:26.299
and your super excuses?

19:26.433 --> 19:27.734
I talk to you.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.336
I'm not a professional.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.938
Yeah, but you're my friend.
That matters to me.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.807
You're a piece of work.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.744
Well, as a friend,
you do me a favor?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.746
Will you talk to Nate?

19:39.846 --> 19:42.782
Even if it's just once?
Okay?

19:42.915 --> 19:44.684
Sure.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.787
You know, maybe we should
have brought some trash bags

19:47.920 --> 19:50.189
and some litter picker-uppers
to do something useful.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.624
You giving up?

19:51.758 --> 19:53.260
You really think we're
gonna find anything?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.994
Not if we stop looking.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.197
You don't think this is
a big, colossal waste of time?

19:58.331 --> 20:01.601
Not if we get crab cake burgers
from Neptune's Net after.

20:01.701 --> 20:06.205
That's the best idea
you've had today.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.541
What's up, Shyla?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.343
No, so far we've been skunked.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.213
Yeah. We're on our way.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.949
Well, somebody's gonna ID
the suspect who was killed.

20:17.049 --> 20:17.984
If we're lucky,
we'll get a search warrant

20:18.117 --> 20:19.552
by the time we get to his place.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.987
Sounds like we're getting
crab burgers to go.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.356
Sounds like it's a rain check.
Damn it.

20:23.490 --> 20:26.125
I knew it was
too good to be true.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.902
You finished?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.404
You have to forgive me.
I thought I was walking

20:37.537 --> 20:39.539
into a Hardy Boys novel
rather than a

20:39.672 --> 20:41.974
federal law enforcement agency.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.644
You guys are like
the grown-up Goonies.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.145
Who's your client?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.847
Afraid I can't tell you.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.482
He broke into a Navy base. Allegedly.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.850
You have any witnesses?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.752
He was found on fire
outside the hole

20:52.885 --> 20:54.321
him and his dead buddy
cut in the fence.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.556
Sounds like the victim
of a tragic accident.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.891
No, it sounds like
obstruction of justice.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.427
Now, who's your client?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.862
I can't tell you his name

21:02.995 --> 21:05.097
because I don't know it.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.599
He's a John Doe.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.402
So this John Doe,
who's unable to talk,

21:09.536 --> 21:10.770
let alone move, called
you to represent him?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.772
Of course not.

21:12.905 --> 21:16.175
Somebody called to render
my services on his behalf.
Okay. Who?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.710
They prefer to remain anonymous.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.349
So your anonymous client
retained your services

21:22.449 --> 21:24.250
without revealing the identity

21:24.384 --> 21:25.785
of the person you're
representing?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.754
Exactly.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.956
And that doesn't seem

21:30.089 --> 21:31.358
the least bit unusual?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.859
We're living in unusual times.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.026
So you're representing someone

21:34.126 --> 21:35.395
and you have no idea
who they are?

21:35.528 --> 21:36.896
The doctor and nurse
who treated him

21:37.029 --> 21:38.398
had no idea who he was.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.199
So, you guys are
the detectives, right?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.936
So detect. You figure it out. Gentlemen.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.606
Hey, don't get up.
I will see myself out.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.041
Hmm.
This guy.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.778
He's analyzing our cards
like <i>American Psycho.</i>

21:51.911 --> 21:53.413
I don't like this.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.714
I don't like any of this.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.152
Man, I hate this part.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.254
Uh, hello, Mr. Langston.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.591
I am Special Agent Kensi Blye.
This is my partner,

22:04.724 --> 22:05.958
Investigator Deeks,
and we're from

22:06.092 --> 22:07.794
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.797
We are so sorry for
your recent loss, sir. Thanks.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.899
Would it be possible
to ask you

22:12.999 --> 22:14.401
a few questions
concerning your son?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.102
No.
Wait, sir, we have
reason to believe...

22:17.169 --> 22:18.671
Okay.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.507
The man just lost his son.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.008
I can't imagine losing a child.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.244
Oh, oh, thank you for
changing your mind.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.180
If you have any questions,
ask my attorney.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.250
Thanks.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.786
Wait.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.788
Jeremy Chambers, Esquire?

22:35.922 --> 22:36.923
That's the same lawyer representing

22:37.023 --> 22:38.525
the guy at the hospital.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.793
Not many dead guys have lawyers.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.495
Not many dead guys
need them.

22:44.096 --> 22:44.997
Where we at?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.833
Just this side of nowhere.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.135
Kensi and Deeks got shut out
by the family of the deceased,

22:49.268 --> 22:51.704
one Ralph Langston.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.974
He's also being retained by
our friend Jeremy Chambers.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.845
What about Fatima and Rountree?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.312
Unfortunately, they found
nothing more at the crime scene,

23:00.447 --> 23:01.981
nor any evidence of a vehicle.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.182
What do we know
about this guy?

23:03.315 --> 23:04.617
He's a bit
of a drifter.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.053
Uh, works as mechanic, construction.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.888
Couple of years
with a welding company.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.791
He doesn't seem to stick
in one place for too long.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.192
He did a short stint
in the National Guard,

23:13.325 --> 23:14.694
but was
dishonorably discharged

23:14.827 --> 23:16.463
for a drug violation.
We get a warrant

23:16.563 --> 23:17.664
to search his place?
Yes,

23:17.797 --> 23:20.366
but he has no fixed address.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.134
He does own an RV,

23:22.234 --> 23:24.070
however, that's been registered
for the past three months

23:24.203 --> 23:27.507
at Mugu Canyon RV Park.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.841
You couldn't get much closer
to the naval base

23:28.975 --> 23:29.976
without being enlisted.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.077
Agents Fatima and Rountree

23:31.210 --> 23:32.344
are on their way there now.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.914
You might have been right
about an RV.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.583
Would be a good Trojan horse

23:36.716 --> 23:38.150
to drop off our
would-be insurgents

23:38.250 --> 23:39.986
before the base.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.205
This guy blew himself
up with an IED.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.340
Got to get the bomb squad
to check it out first.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.448
Hey, Sam. Fatima,

24:09.582 --> 24:10.449
pull back! This thing
could be booby trapped.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.786
No!

24:46.919 --> 24:48.454
So, the bomb squad said that

24:48.588 --> 24:49.956
the explosives are
the same configuration

24:50.089 --> 24:51.057
that blew the two of them up.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.759
All right, so this is either

24:52.892 --> 24:54.561
a paranoid psychotic
security device,

24:54.661 --> 24:57.296
or someone rigged it after what
happened to the two suspects

24:57.429 --> 24:59.131
so we couldn't find
any more evidence.

24:59.265 --> 25:01.233
I'm not sure either version
is really that encouraging.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.803
Mm.
How's Fatima and Rountree?

25:03.936 --> 25:05.638
Well, they got their
bells rung pretty good.

25:05.772 --> 25:08.107
They'll be fine once
they get their hearing back,

25:08.240 --> 25:09.809
but I'm gonna send 'em home.
Good luck with that.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.611
They're not gonna take a knee,
especially now.

25:11.744 --> 25:12.812
Well, we're not gonna
find any more evidence.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.313
It's all been shredded
at this point.

25:14.446 --> 25:15.414
SHYLA
True. Whatever physical evidence

25:15.514 --> 25:16.983
was in that RV may be lost,

25:17.116 --> 25:19.919
but his digital footprint
lives on.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.822
I was able to secure records
of calls and texts,

25:22.955 --> 25:24.523
along with his online activity.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.292
Divorced, surprise, surprise.

25:26.425 --> 25:28.494
No children.
Thank God for wee miracles.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.862
Looks like he's never met

25:29.996 --> 25:31.764
a conspiracy theory
he didn't like.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.833
I'm sure there's a flat-Earth
membership somewhere in there.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.467
Is he a gun owner?

25:35.602 --> 25:38.170
More like a gun collector.
Dumb and dangerous.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.139
Which sadly describes most
of my recent dates.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.308
We didn't find any signs
of weapons in the wreckage.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.476
Which suggests somebody
cleaned out the place first,

25:44.611 --> 25:46.779
took any real evidence
before booby trapping the place.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.947
I sent screen grabs

25:48.047 --> 25:49.616
to your phones
from last night.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.785
His most recent phone
and text conversations were with

25:52.885 --> 25:55.655
two local individuals:
James Miller and William Baker.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.356
This reads like they're
all in this together.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.191
James Miller's been offline
since last night.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.661
William Baker, however,
has been making calls.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.562
Get this:
he set up a GoFundMe page

26:03.696 --> 26:06.332
for his friend,
who was badly burned in--

26:06.465 --> 26:09.001
and I quote--
"a military training exercise."

26:12.404 --> 26:13.906
So there's a very good
chance James Miller

26:14.040 --> 26:15.374
is our suspect in the ICU.

26:15.507 --> 26:16.709
And what do we know
about William Baker?

26:16.843 --> 26:17.977
Baker owns a ranch.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.146
Well, it belonged
to his parents.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.581
They raised horses and cattle
back in the day.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.583
It was left to him
when they died.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.886
From his online photos,
the only thing I think

26:27.019 --> 26:28.320
he's raising there now is hell.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.522
It looks like an insurgent
training ground.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.025
I requested a warrant and sent
the address to your phones.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.661
All right, tell
Kensi and Deeks to sit tight.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.062
There's no telling how
this guy's gonna react

26:36.195 --> 26:36.929
when we roll up.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.430
You got it.

26:38.564 --> 26:39.666
Copy that, Shyla.
We'll stay put

26:39.766 --> 26:40.767
until Callen and Sam get here.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.836
They want us to hang tight.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.172
Must be their war games playground.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.240
Yeah, lucky,
lucky us.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.618
‚ô™ It was just

26:59.752 --> 27:03.289
‚ô™ One of those things ‚ô™

27:03.422 --> 27:06.793
‚ô™ Just one of those
crazy flings... ‚ô™

27:06.926 --> 27:09.095
This better be good, Dahr.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.463
‚ô™ One of those bells
that now and then rings... ‚ô™

27:11.597 --> 27:12.899
I didn't mean
to wake you, Admiral.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.367
I was not sleeping.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.537
I was meditating.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.041
My doctor says that
it will help to center me.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.943
‚ô™ Just one of those... ‚ô™

27:24.076 --> 27:26.245
Do I look centered?

27:26.378 --> 27:28.948
Oh, yes. Dead center, sir.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.117
‚ô™ On gossamer wings... ‚ô™

27:31.250 --> 27:33.786
As someone who has practiced
meditation her whole life,

27:33.920 --> 27:37.556
I might offer a suggestion to
try doing so without the music.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.258
You meditate your way,

27:39.391 --> 27:42.494
I will meditate
with Mr. Bennett.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.296
He centers me.

27:44.430 --> 27:47.800
Sir, I'd like to request
to go into the field.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.970
‚ô™ Love affair was too hot ‚ô™

27:51.103 --> 27:52.905
‚ô™ Not to cool down. ‚ô™

27:53.005 --> 27:54.573
Making a Starbucks run?

27:54.673 --> 27:58.144
With agents Namazi and Rountree
out of commission,

27:58.277 --> 27:59.812
and knowing the nature
of these suspects,

27:59.946 --> 28:01.580
I think the team
could use the backup.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.182
What about Ops?

28:03.315 --> 28:04.283
I've already tasked
another operational manager

28:04.416 --> 28:05.785
to cover for me.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.619
The ranch we're investigating
is off the grid,

28:07.754 --> 28:09.789
so there's little for us
to offer from here.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.991
All right, let's go.
You're coming, too, sir?

28:12.124 --> 28:13.760
Is that a problem?
Uh, no, sir.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.762
I didn't mean to
drag you out there.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.130
Let you guys have all the fun?

28:18.264 --> 28:19.866
No. Secure us a chopper.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.133
You want to take a helicopter?

28:21.267 --> 28:23.002
Oh, you're damn straight.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.938
The only thing I hate worse
than armed insurrectionists

28:26.038 --> 28:28.775
is the L.A. traffic that
keeps me from them.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.047
It's awful quiet.
Maybe nobody's in there.

28:35.181 --> 28:38.550
So, I was thinking that

28:38.684 --> 28:41.720
since we're going through the
adoption process already, uh...

28:41.854 --> 28:43.289
And we are going
through with it.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.690
That's what we said, yeah.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.159
That didn't sound like
a lot of commitment.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.227
Are you having second thoughts?

28:48.360 --> 28:49.962
No. Wait, are you?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.197
No, not at all.
Are you sure?

28:51.330 --> 28:54.200
I'm 100% sure.
I want us to adopt Rosa.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.534
Okay. Okay.
I'm in.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.570
Okay.
Yes.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.372
Um, well, as I was saying,

29:00.506 --> 29:02.741
since we are already
going through the process, Yeah.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.210
I was thinking that
maybe we could do

29:04.343 --> 29:05.845
the same thing for Pilar.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.014
You know, in case they
reject her asylum request.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.850
I'm sorry, wait, what?

29:10.983 --> 29:13.485
Y-You want to adopt
two children?

29:13.585 --> 29:14.887
I mean, they're minors--
I wouldn't exactly

29:15.021 --> 29:16.688
call them children.
- <i>ho Are the DeBolts?
- W</i>

29:16.823 --> 29:18.825
<i>nd Where Did They Get 19 Kids?a</i>
W-What?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.359
- <i>ho Are the DeBolts?
- W</i> <i>nd Where'd They Get 19 Kids?a</i>

29:20.492 --> 29:21.427
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Deeks.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.529
What I'm talking about is

29:23.662 --> 29:25.264
two young, well-adjusted women.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.066
It's a '70s documentary.
It won the Oscar.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.068
It doesn't matter.
Deeks, what are you s... Okay.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.570
So, just to clarify
it then, again,
Mm-hmm.

29:31.703 --> 29:33.906
One, not enough, just, the...
One is not enough.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.774
They both need a home.
Okay, yeah.

29:35.908 --> 29:36.909
We have enough space.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.911
We've got, eh.
And this way,

29:39.045 --> 29:40.779
they would have each other
or support as well.
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.348
Okay, so just instant family.

29:42.448 --> 29:46.618
Just add equal parts
responsibility and sheer panic.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.787
Well, I have my
bond with Rosa

29:48.921 --> 29:49.889
because of our whole ordeal. Right.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.024
And you have a bond with Pilar

29:52.124 --> 29:53.960
because of your whole,
like, "Team Vampire" thing.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.795
Okay, just for the record,
it's Team Werewolf. But also, Sorry.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.230
Sorry.
I don't think that's
a foundational argument

29:58.364 --> 30:00.066
for adoption.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.068
Look, they're both at risk
at being sent back.
I know.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.937
Okay.
Pilar, probably at a
greater risk than Rosa.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.106
And we can do this,
we should do this,

30:07.239 --> 30:09.808
so... what is
your hesitation?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.644
Uh, e... Besides the prospect
of being responsible

30:12.778 --> 30:15.481
for the lives of two young
women-- you mean besides that?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.117
If not us, then who?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.418
I mean, not even to mention

30:19.551 --> 30:21.420
the whole white savior optics
of it all.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.589
Since when do you care
what anybody thinks?

30:23.722 --> 30:27.426
When it's a racially complex
and complicated situation. Deeks,

30:27.559 --> 30:30.596
That is a fair statement.
all the more reason
to keep them together.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.166
I can see it in your face
that you know I'm right.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.734
I... It... I-I'm not...
You know I'm right in
your mushy, mushy heart.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.003
I know you know.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.939
Two.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.140
Two daughters.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.675
Two "da-haugh-ter-ters."

30:43.809 --> 30:46.512
We will give them
so much love.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.420
Shoot, that's a woman
in trouble.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.421
Shyla, we're moving in.

30:55.521 --> 30:56.755
Let's go.

31:04.263 --> 31:06.132
Moving.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.267
Federal agents.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.702
Is there anybody in here?
We're here to help.

31:12.804 --> 31:13.839
Kens.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.343
Hello?

31:17.476 --> 31:20.312
Hey.
Oh, geez. Hey.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.716
We're here to help.
What's your name?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.553
Miss, it's okay.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.388
Not for you. Whoa.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.057
Whoa.
No, drop it.
Look at me.

31:31.190 --> 31:35.394
Drop it. Drop it.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.997
I think you're the ones
should drop your weapons.

31:55.514 --> 31:58.017
Party's over, sports fans.

32:11.897 --> 32:13.499
Look, you're already
in enough trouble.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.235
You don't want to do this.
Don't want to what--

32:16.368 --> 32:17.703
fight for my right for freedom?

32:17.836 --> 32:21.340
I think you're the ones
in trouble.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.908
You're trespassing on my land.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.610
We thought your friend
was in trouble. Ah.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.278
CALLEN
Keep him talking.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.516
We're here.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.783
How many we looking at?

32:31.917 --> 32:34.220
You and your four friends know

32:34.353 --> 32:35.554
that we're
federal agents, right?

32:35.687 --> 32:36.955
We don't recognize
your authority.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.524
Don't recognize
your government, neither.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.859
Ignorance isn't
the best defense.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.461
Although, I got to be honest,
I really do love

32:42.594 --> 32:44.396
the interior of this barn.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.232
Did your designer
pay extra for those

32:46.365 --> 32:47.766
two and three-quarter panels
of reclaimed wood?

32:47.899 --> 32:50.036
We're coming in.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.207
Get out there, now!

33:00.979 --> 33:02.648
That was our team
surrounding this place.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.716
You throw down your guns,
you surrender peacefully,

33:04.816 --> 33:07.919
everybody walks out of here.
But if you make a stand...

33:08.054 --> 33:09.255
it's gonna be your Alamo.

33:10.256 --> 33:12.124
So be it, then.

33:12.258 --> 33:13.759
Some things are worth
fighting for.

33:13.892 --> 33:15.261
Yeah, but is it
worth dying for?

33:15.394 --> 33:16.762
Damn right it is.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.649
They got a chopper.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.318
Looks like the
cavalry's arrived.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.519
It's not gonna
end well for you guys.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.254
You think so?
Yeah, I do.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.257
Uh-huh?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.464
Oh, my God.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.832
Where'd you get an AT4?

33:53.965 --> 33:56.335
Wouldn't you like to know?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.212
Who the hell is that?

34:38.177 --> 34:39.745
Willie!

34:39.878 --> 34:42.314
You hear that? That's
the sound of defeat.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.153
Karma's a bitch.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.021
Drop it! Now.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.991
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.932
Get up. Get up!
All right,
easy, easy, easy.

35:01.066 --> 35:02.067
Stay down, hippy boy.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.769
Federal agents.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.771
Drop the weapon.
You ain't taking me alive!

35:05.904 --> 35:08.907
Oh!

35:11.777 --> 35:13.745
Stay down.
Way to sweep the leg,

35:13.879 --> 35:15.013
Daniel-san. I mean,
I would have done

35:15.113 --> 35:16.615
the crane kick,
but I like it.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.116
You like that?
Yeah. I mean,
not for me,

35:18.250 --> 35:19.251
but for bad guys,
for sure.
Oh, okay.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.354
We all good in here?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.190
Yeah. You?
We're solid.

35:24.290 --> 35:27.393
Good. Let's clean up this mess
and go home.

35:27.526 --> 35:30.229
Thank you, sir. Shotgun.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.605
Your ears still ringing?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.039
Oh, yeah.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.741
How long's it
supposed to last?

35:42.874 --> 35:46.478
Well, it took three days after
my last Prodigy concert, so...

35:46.612 --> 35:48.146
Great.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.381
But you know what
this is good for?

35:49.481 --> 35:50.882
Long-term hearing loss?

35:50.982 --> 35:53.452
It's the perfect night
to watch <i>Yojimbo.</i>

35:53.585 --> 35:54.953
What is that?

35:55.086 --> 35:57.789
Kurosawa. Toshiro Mifune.

35:57.923 --> 36:00.292
Oh, you sweet, sweet man,
you have so much to learn.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.960
How am I supposed
to watch a movie

36:02.093 --> 36:03.462
if I can't hear?

36:03.595 --> 36:05.231
Well, it's subtitled.
That's the beauty of it.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.399
You're gonna love it.
It's, like, one of the greatest

36:07.499 --> 36:09.235
samurai movies of all time.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.603
You do like martial arts
films, right?

36:11.737 --> 36:14.340
Like what?
Like <i>Shogun Assassin,</i>

36:14.473 --> 36:17.142
<i>ive Deadly Venoms,</i> uh, <i>F</i>
- <i>xecutioners from Shaolin?
- E</i>

36:17.276 --> 36:19.144
Are these real movies?

36:19.278 --> 36:21.680
You poor, misguided soul.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.449
We ought to get some Postmates

36:23.582 --> 36:27.018
because you are, sir,
are in for a very long night.

36:27.152 --> 36:28.654
- <i>all me back, Arkady, I mean it.
- C</i>

36:28.787 --> 36:31.490
I really wouldn't sweat this,
all right?

36:31.623 --> 36:33.859
Anna's Arkady's only daughter.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.027
Well, that we know of.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.330
If he doesn't give his blessing,

36:38.464 --> 36:40.198
Anna's not gonna let him
come to the wedding.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.935
And you know he won't
be able to live with that.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.604
That's not a bad strategy.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.972
You're damn right it isn't.

36:47.105 --> 36:48.607
Grab a beer?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.176
I'd love to, but
I've got to get home to my dad.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.844
Maybe come by this weekend,
we hang out?

36:52.978 --> 36:55.314
Yeah. I would like that. Okay.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.549
Night.
You too.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.554
<i>So, every time we order pizza,</i>

37:02.688 --> 37:03.855
I try to save two pieces,

37:03.989 --> 37:05.023
and then I put them
in the refrigerator

37:05.156 --> 37:06.392
for the next morning
for breakfast.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.327
But somehow, every single night
I go to bed,

37:08.460 --> 37:10.729
and then she sleepwalks,
and somehow then

37:10.862 --> 37:11.997
sleep-eats my pizza.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.899
In the morning,
it's completely gone.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.834
Not your favorite?

37:15.967 --> 37:18.504
I'm not very hungry.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.707
Rosa.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.141
We are taking several steps

37:23.241 --> 37:25.143
to ensure that
you get to stay here,

37:25.243 --> 37:28.013
and we're not gonna give up
until we find one that works.

37:28.146 --> 37:29.381
You hear me?

37:42.260 --> 37:45.163
There is one other thing
we can try, Rosa,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.434
and we would need your blessing.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.071
And there's no guarantees
that it would work,

37:53.204 --> 37:55.707
so we didn't want to get
your hopes up.
That's okay.

37:55.841 --> 37:59.345
I don't have much hope
left anyway.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.113
Rosa.

38:04.950 --> 38:08.687
How would you feel
if we adopted you?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.423
Um, obviously,

38:11.557 --> 38:13.425
it would-it would be
what you wanted to do,

38:13.559 --> 38:15.694
and we'd st... Oh. Oh.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.531
Gonna take that as a yes.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.403
Yeah? Yeah?

38:36.615 --> 38:39.451
‚ô™ It was just

38:39.585 --> 38:41.720
‚ô™ One of those things ‚ô™

38:43.054 --> 38:46.825
‚ô™ Just one of those
crazy flings... ‚ô™

38:46.958 --> 38:49.461
Hey.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.964
Yeah, yeah, I found something
resembling furniture.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.433
Where'd you get the beer?

38:54.566 --> 38:56.067
Grocery store.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.936
I thought I told you
not to leave the house, Dad.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.337
Excuse me?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.339
I asked you nicely,
for your own good,

39:01.473 --> 39:02.574
not to leave the house.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.142
Well, I know
what's for my own good.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.578
For your information,
I didn't leave the prison yard.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.580
I found one that delivered.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.181
Heh. Want one?

39:10.315 --> 39:12.283
Oh, hell yeah.

39:12.418 --> 39:16.087
‚ô™ One of those things... ‚ô™

39:16.187 --> 39:19.458
Notice anything else missing,
besides furniture,

39:19.591 --> 39:20.926
from this picture?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.094
‚ô™ Started to
paint that town... ‚ô™

39:23.194 --> 39:24.863
you don't own a TV, do you?

39:24.996 --> 39:26.465
No, I prefer to read at night.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.867
Yeah, my warrior monk.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.335
Well, I'm buying us a TV.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.170
And a big one.

39:32.303 --> 39:33.772
Knock yourself out, Pop.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.841
Yeah.

39:35.974 --> 39:40.111
Guess we'll have to establish
a few new house rules.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.781
I had 52 Hanna house rules
growing up.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.516
I'm not sure
I could take any more.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.518
Well, different living
arrangements now,

39:46.652 --> 39:49.120
if you... if you know
what I'm saying, son.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.989
I don't.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.290
We're gonna have to
come to an arrangement

39:52.390 --> 39:55.293
about the ladies.
What ladies?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.295
I'm old, son,
I'm not dead.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.466
Come on.

40:00.566 --> 40:02.167
Are you serious?

40:02.300 --> 40:04.803
Have 'em running
through here, just...

40:04.903 --> 40:07.138
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.807
Okay.

40:29.895 --> 40:31.930
Okay, ready? No,
that's yours, take it.
Take it.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.933
Aah! Go.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.535
That's yours.
Take it.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.269
What is the Joker?
How do you...

40:38.403 --> 40:39.370
Joker? What?

40:39.505 --> 40:41.740
One, two, three.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.341
Oh!

40:43.441 --> 40:45.276
One, two, three.

40:45.410 --> 40:49.948
‚ô™ If we'd thought of it,
'bout the end of it ‚ô™

40:50.081 --> 40:54.285
‚ô™ When we started
to paint that town ‚ô™

40:54.419 --> 40:56.755
‚ô™ We'd have been aware ‚ô™

40:56.888 --> 40:59.090
‚ô™ That our love affair ‚ô™

40:59.224 --> 41:03.695
‚ô™ Was too hot
not to cool down ‚ô™

41:03.795 --> 41:09.568
‚ô™ So goodbye,
goodbye, dear, amen ‚ô™

41:09.701 --> 41:13.605
