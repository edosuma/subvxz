00:02.402 --> 00:08.466
..the superior court of the state
of Pennsylvania declares case BD-237 closed.

00:10.310 --> 00:15.145
That's why l suggested you file
the joint summary with ajoint petition...

00:19.119 --> 00:20.484
Thank you.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.014 --> 00:48.708
No way.

00:57.257 --> 00:58.053
Right.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.910
These craft, where were the majority sighted?

03:38.985 --> 03:42.477
On route home, me, others,

03:42.555 --> 03:45.149
walk on the minefield by base.

03:45.658 --> 03:48.320
Long, black car drive up...

03:49.529 --> 03:52.430
No door handle, no window.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.092
No persons drive.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.533
We run.

03:57.370 --> 03:58.701
Mines,

03:59.372 --> 04:00.964
explosion, but

04:01.741 --> 04:03.402
no sound.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.341
Nothing.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.376
Silent.

04:09.048 --> 04:12.211
You said others.
Any of them with you in America?

04:12.285 --> 04:14.378
Yes. Three of us...

04:16.154 --> 04:18.452
Can you verify...

04:18.524 --> 04:22.187
Difficult. KGB still have much power.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.500
We are each mentioned in...

04:40.713 --> 04:43.546
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Denunzio, hi.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.347
This is Ed Jerse at Fuller and Siegel.
How are you this morning?

04:47.420 --> 04:50.287
- The kids, you know.
- l understand.

04:50.356 --> 04:54.087
l wanted to call and let you in
on a stock that's going public next week.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.654
lt's so hard after the holidays.
Don't hit her with that! l mean it!

04:58.731 --> 05:00.198
l'm sorry. What?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.700
A company in Tucson called Cryo-Cord

05:02.769 --> 05:07.729
has achieved an amazing advancement
in the technology of cryogenics.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.537
Stem cells from the blood
of an umbilical cord

05:10.610 --> 05:14.102
may be transplanted in the treatment
of diseases such as...

05:14.180 --> 05:16.148
Loser.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.680
Such as?

05:19.452 --> 05:21.920
- What?
- Diseases such as?

05:21.988 --> 05:25.583
- Before that, what did you say?
- Nothing. You were talking.

05:36.302 --> 05:39.066
The stock is always gonna come around.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.936
- Then l just punch it up here?
- Say it to my face.

05:42.141 --> 05:46.737
Right to my face. Now that l'm in front
of you, call me a loser to my face!

05:46.813 --> 05:49.611
- Calm down.
- Trash her desk!

05:53.319 --> 05:55.480
Why don't you go home, Ed?

05:56.656 --> 05:58.886
We'll discuss this later.

06:13.606 --> 06:19.238
l made an effort to get out of it, but the
Bureau is sticking to its vacation policy.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.839
l haven't taken a day off in four years,
so either l go now,

06:22.915 --> 06:26.351
or they start not paying me
for eight weeks' vacation.

06:26.419 --> 06:30.617
l don't like it, but l gotta do it.
l gotta pay the rent. l gotta eat.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.921
l can't help thinking this is
a way to get me outta here.

06:33.993 --> 06:39.488
But it is only a week, and you'll be here
to keep an eye on things for me, so...

06:39.565 --> 06:42.659
Here's a few things for you
to keep an eye on while l'm gone.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.726
Why don't l have a desk?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.863
What do you mean?

06:47.540 --> 06:50.441
l always assumed that that was your area.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.068
Back there.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.945
OK, we'll get another desk
and there won't be any room to move,

06:56.015 --> 06:59.678
but we can put them face-to-face.
Maybe we can play battleship.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.879
What is it you want me to keep an eye on?

07:01.954 --> 07:06.050
That contact we met last night,
who was present for a first.

07:06.125 --> 07:11.427
You abandoning me during questioning.
ln the future, all people being interviewed

07:11.497 --> 07:16.161
will provide you with a laser show
to keep your interest maintained.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.795
ln any case, his name is Vsevlod Pudovkin.

07:18.871 --> 07:22.102
He has a doctorate
in astronautical engineering.

07:22.175 --> 07:26.737
He and other contacts worked at a military
space center in the Republic of Karelia.

07:26.813 --> 07:31.876
They smuggled out reports of two alien craft
which were retrieved from the Sea of Barents.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.385
And these reports are for sale?

07:35.488 --> 07:36.955
At a high price, yeah.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.149
Do you know the identity
of these individuals?

07:41.227 --> 07:42.694
That's your assignment.

07:42.762 --> 07:46.858
l want you to run a Bureau NClC check
on these individuals,

07:47.400 --> 07:50.369
all of whom now reside in Philadelphia.

07:50.436 --> 07:55.533
l've also made arrangements for travel so
you can administer eye-to-eye surveillance.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.309
l'm not going.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.402
What do you mean?

08:00.480 --> 08:04.246
Your contact, while interesting
in the context of science fiction,

08:04.317 --> 08:08.879
was, at least in my memory,
recounting a poorly-veiled synopsis

08:08.955 --> 08:11.480
of an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

08:11.557 --> 08:15.516
''Eenie, meenie, chili beanie,
the spirits are about to speak''?

08:15.595 --> 08:19.395
Rocky and Bullwinkle
are looking for an upsidasium mine.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.298
Boris Badenov alters the road signs,

08:22.368 --> 08:25.860
which causes them
to walk onto a secret military base,

08:25.938 --> 08:29.874
where they are picked up by a car
with no windows, no door locks,

08:29.942 --> 08:34.311
and there are silent explosions
from a compound called Hushaboom.

08:34.380 --> 08:38.544
You're refusing an assignment based
on the adventures of Moose and Squirrel?

08:38.618 --> 08:41.485
That makes it sound
like you're my superior.

08:41.554 --> 08:47.117
Do what you want. But l worked my ass off
to get these files reopened.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.162
You were just assigned.
This work is my life.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.322
And it's become mine.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.563
- You don't want it to be?
- This isn't about you.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.538
Maybe it is indirectly. l don't know.

09:02.074 --> 09:05.134
l feel like l've lost sight of myself, Mulder.

09:06.379 --> 09:11.510
lt's hard to see, let alone
find in the darkness of covert locations.

09:12.218 --> 09:18.384
l wish l could say that we're going in circles,
but we're not. We're going in an endless line.

09:18.457 --> 09:21.893
Two steps forwards and three steps back,

09:22.862 --> 09:24.989
while my own life is

09:25.364 --> 09:26.524
standing still.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.230
Maybe it's good that
we get away from each other for a while.

09:36.008 --> 09:39.535
- Where will you be?
- lronically enough, it's personal.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.012
lt's a... place l always wanted to go,

09:42.081 --> 09:45.050
what l anticipate to be a spiritual journey.

09:45.117 --> 09:48.609
l hope to discover something about myself.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.923
Maybe you should do the same.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.711
Yes, Mrs Shima-Tsuno.

10:13.779 --> 10:18.307
Ma'am, what if l swore to you
that it would never happen again?

10:23.489 --> 10:26.219
l just would like another chance.

10:28.761 --> 10:32.094
l need another chance, Mrs Shima-Tsuno.

10:33.933 --> 10:37.596
Well, that stock l recommended -
Virtual Gambling - is up.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.452
l understand.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.824
Thank you for your time.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.721
Goodbye.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.407
''Thank you for your time.''

11:21.080 --> 11:25.813
lf you were any kind of man, you would have
told her to kiss your ass. But no.

11:27.620 --> 11:30.248
Another woman sticks it to ya.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.958
Ain't that right, Eddie?

11:50.242 --> 11:53.302
l can hear you down there!

11:53.379 --> 11:57.076
Stop it! Knock it off! l can hear you!

11:57.149 --> 11:59.583
Shut up down there!

11:59.652 --> 12:02.678
Stop it! Stop it!

12:02.755 --> 12:06.020
Knock it off! l can hear you!

12:06.092 --> 12:09.027
[Sound] l go downtown and roam all around

12:09.095 --> 12:13.259
[Sound] But every street l walk
l find another dead end

12:14.066 --> 12:17.661
You hear that? lt's you, Ed.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.399
lt's all about you!

12:21.607 --> 12:22.938
Knock it off!

12:23.209 --> 12:27.043
[Sound] l know there's someone
just waitin'somewhere

12:27.113 --> 12:29.946
[Sound] l look around for her
but she's just not there

12:34.887 --> 12:37.378
Good evening.
My name is Hannah, this is Spencer.

12:37.456 --> 12:41.688
- Have you imagined what it would...
- Do you hear that?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.285
Downstairs.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.559
What l hear is the confusing
and troubling sound of...

12:46.632 --> 12:48.691
She's tryin' to drive me crazy.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.329
We just talked to Miss Schilling
and l don't believe she...

12:52.404 --> 12:55.202
Somehow... she knows what l'm thinking.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.403
l don't want to feel it, but they know,

12:58.477 --> 13:03.312
like psychics or somethin'
or an implant thing, tryin' to drive me crazy.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.816
They've programmed the TV to criticize me.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.921
There. You hear it? There! There! There!

13:10.656 --> 13:12.954
We'll come back some other time.

13:16.595 --> 13:17.994
You see?

13:18.063 --> 13:21.396
Even the Jehovah Witness babe
won't waste her time on you.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.435
No woman would.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.164
And you just sit and take it.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.737
Take it like a man.

13:37.383 --> 13:40.079
Hey, what are you doing? Get outta here.

13:41.754 --> 13:46.350
Get out of my apartment.
l'm gonna call the cops!

13:46.425 --> 13:48.359
No! No! Please! Get out!

15:44.043 --> 15:48.878
Attaboy, lover.
From now on, l'm your right-hand gal.

15:49.715 --> 15:51.615
You and me.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.876
As long as l'm with you,
no one will ever hurt you.

15:56.588 --> 15:58.715
Never again!

16:22.114 --> 16:24.207
Scully, it's me.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.112
l'm just calling to see how you're doing.

16:28.053 --> 16:32.786
Give me a call on my cell when you get
a chance. Just let me know where you're at.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.593
Just watch yourself, all right?

17:58.043 --> 18:01.809
- That's not my problem.
- You did good work.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.680
Very nice. lt's just like in the window. But...

18:06.385 --> 18:08.876
So what? Why do you want to cover it?

18:10.255 --> 18:13.952
Listen, friend,
everyone gets tattoo they deserve.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.187
What if you don't cover the whole thing?
Just the eyes and the mouth.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.722
Even if l say yes, it's too soon.
Skin must heal.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.666
l'll pay you anything.

18:24.736 --> 18:25.998
Miss? Miss?

18:26.305 --> 18:29.206
You. You like this on his arm?

18:41.220 --> 18:42.710
Eddie?

18:42.788 --> 18:47.316
The... the color... the red on the lips...
it's extraordinary.

18:47.893 --> 18:53.695
Something l find in Soviet prison.
l tell him everyone gets tattoo they deserve.

18:54.366 --> 18:58.666
- Beautiful, cheap...
- l thought l was your girl.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.865
Tattoo reflect on body
what lies in person's soul.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.432
You'd break my heart over a cheap redhead?

19:05.511 --> 19:08.071
Used the sewing needle, paper clip.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.913
You talk to her, and l'm gonna be bad!

19:13.852 --> 19:17.185
l find grasses grow in prison yard,
rye and such.

19:17.256 --> 19:20.020
Only use now, on that tattoo.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.421
Svo.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.331
Pardon me.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.924
- You look.
- Thank you.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.475
Mind some advice from a stranger?

19:40.479 --> 19:43.243
Think it over before you get it done.

19:43.315 --> 19:48.912
- You didn't get the tattoo you deserve?
- Mine was too impulsive.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.746
Never say never?

19:52.791 --> 19:55.385
Sometimes l wish l were that impulsive.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.121
Careful what you wish for.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.798
There's more fashionable places in the city.
How did you end up here?

20:04.469 --> 20:09.133
l'm in town visiting my aunt
in the neighborhood. How about you?

20:10.075 --> 20:15.035
There's a crummy bar across the street.
lt's good for when you're feelin' down,

20:15.113 --> 20:18.082
and l was kind of down last week, and...

20:18.150 --> 20:21.517
So it wasn't so much impulsive
as it was hammered?

20:27.092 --> 20:30.255
Have you seen much of Philadelphia?

20:30.829 --> 20:31.557
No.

20:32.965 --> 20:37.766
There's a couple of really nice restaurants
by the river, if you're interested.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.394
l'd like that.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.363
But...

20:42.774 --> 20:44.833
l'm leaving tonight.

20:46.845 --> 20:50.008
lf you're ever in town again...

20:50.916 --> 20:53.680
That's my home number.
l work there mainly.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.063
- Hello?
- Scully?

21:16.141 --> 21:18.371
- Mulder, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.277
l'm at that special place,
and l wanted to share it with you.

21:22.347 --> 21:25.339
You know Elvis bought
the furniture in 30 minutes?

21:25.417 --> 21:26.975
How did you know where l was?

21:27.052 --> 21:31.421
l checked where we always stay.
l knew you wouldn't abandon me.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.855
How's the case going?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.488
l've handed it over
to the Philadelphia Bureau.

21:36.561 --> 21:40.122
Philadelphia Bureau?
They don't know or care about the X-Files.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.598
Mulder, there is no X-File.

21:42.668 --> 21:45.694
Your contact is connected
to the Vorovskoi Mir.

21:45.771 --> 21:49.605
Extortion, credit fraud, cons.
He is nothing but a swindler.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.700
- How do you know?
- How do l know?

21:51.777 --> 21:55.713
You assigned me the background check.
l did as told, as always.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.840
Hold off until l get there, OK?

21:57.916 --> 22:00.908
- You don't think l'm capable?
- Of course l do.

22:00.986 --> 22:05.184
- lt's just that in this case l need you to...
- lt's notjust in this case.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.590
What's the agent's name in Philadelphia?

22:08.660 --> 22:13.461
lt is over. Done.
Pudovkin is out of our hands.

22:14.132 --> 22:15.622
Mulder, l have to go.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.101
You got a date or something?

22:20.439 --> 22:22.134
You're kidding?

22:22.207 --> 22:26.769
l have everything under control.
l will talk to you later.

22:50.402 --> 22:53.337
lsn't it better this way, baby?

22:53.405 --> 22:56.431
Me and you alone?

22:56.508 --> 22:59.807
Women are so petty, jealous,

23:00.379 --> 23:02.074
controlling.

23:02.147 --> 23:05.674
That bitch today would have been
just like all the others.

23:11.323 --> 23:15.692
- Hello?
- Hi. Ed Jerse, please.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.525
- This is him.
- lt's Dana. We met today.

23:18.597 --> 23:22.158
My flight was canceled because of this storm,

23:22.234 --> 23:25.795
and l was just wondering
if l could take you up on dinner.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.499
l think it's worth fighting a little snow.

23:29.908 --> 23:33.036
One thing, my car is in the shop.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.204
- We'll have to meet.
- l can pick you up.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.047
- Give me an hour?
- Good. Well, l'll see you then.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.316
Go ahead. Treat yourself.

23:47.392 --> 23:50.327
This girl is a real doll.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.023
But beauty's only skin deep, baby.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.929
l go all the way to the bone.

24:13.351 --> 24:15.410
Miss Schilling?

24:16.321 --> 24:18.152
She said she'd be here.

24:18.223 --> 24:20.657
- l don't understand.
- Miss Schilling?

24:34.206 --> 24:37.004
l'm early. The storm's not so bad.

24:37.075 --> 24:40.067
lt's supposed to get bad later tonight.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.376
Come on in. l'll be ready in a second.

24:49.821 --> 24:53.552
We can forego the
''what a nice place you have'' formalities.

24:54.926 --> 24:57.326
Ed, l...

24:57.629 --> 24:59.790
l don't go out very much.

25:00.398 --> 25:04.391
The last time l went on a date
was to see Glengarry Glen Ross,

25:04.469 --> 25:07.563
and the characters in the movie
had a better time.

25:11.276 --> 25:13.574
Ed, you're bleeding.

25:14.679 --> 25:18.410
lt's just the damn tattoo.

25:18.483 --> 25:21.475
l'm a doctor.
Do you want me to take a look at it?

25:21.553 --> 25:24.954
No, it's OK. lt's been nothin' but trouble.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.537
l hope you like this place.
l made reservations.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.388
Ed...

26:03.428 --> 26:06.158
The crummy bar you told me about...

26:08.099 --> 26:09.327
Take me there.

26:12.003 --> 26:16.940
So what makes this place a good place to go
when you're feeling down?

26:17.008 --> 26:18.873
lt's kinda...

26:19.744 --> 26:23.680
Everyone here looks like their problems
are worse than mine.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.777
Makes me feel good about myself.

26:26.851 --> 26:31.049
You can't tell what's going on in
somebody's head by looking at them.

26:31.122 --> 26:34.114
They're probably thinking
we're the screwed-up ones.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.285
Are we?

26:37.495 --> 26:40.931
Who knows? l mean, sometimes l...

26:42.500 --> 26:45.162
l've always gone around in this...

26:46.171 --> 26:47.900
this circle.

26:48.607 --> 26:54.568
lt usually starts when an authoritative
or controlling figure comes into my life.

26:55.180 --> 26:58.149
And part of me likes it, needs it,

26:58.216 --> 27:00.207
wants the approval.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.147
But then at a certain point,

27:03.822 --> 27:06.188
along the way, l just, you know...

27:09.461 --> 27:10.826
OK.

27:14.699 --> 27:17.190
My father was a navy captain.

27:17.268 --> 27:18.860
l worshipped...

27:18.937 --> 27:22.338
l worship the sea that he sailed on.

27:23.241 --> 27:27.769
And when l was 13 or so,
l went through this thing,

27:27.846 --> 27:31.145
where l would sneak out
of my parents' house.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.377
and smoke my mother's cigarettes.

27:33.451 --> 27:37.217
And l did it because l knew
that if he found out, he would kill me.

27:37.288 --> 27:40.121
And then along the way,

27:40.925 --> 27:43.018
there are other fathers.

27:43.895 --> 27:47.331
Sounds a little like your time
has come around again.

27:48.033 --> 27:52.993
l want things more like a straight line,
and l don't ever want to go backward.

27:53.071 --> 27:56.165
That's why l got the tattoo l deserve.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.372
lt marked a moment,

28:02.947 --> 28:04.847
a feeling,

28:05.016 --> 28:09.476
a memorial of something
l never want to have happen again.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.956
l wanna see it.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.824
You know, Dana,
just cos l marked the moment,

28:20.899 --> 28:24.300
wanting to go forward,
doesn't mean that it worked.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.395
- l wanna see it.
- Come on. lt's all scabbed up.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.528
That's OK.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.336
lf you're so curious,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.146
get your own.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.174
She wants the same red, like mine.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.903
lt's really bad out.

30:16.981 --> 30:23.079
Look, the weather and a few drinks under
your belt, l'd feel better if you stayed here.

30:26.991 --> 30:32.623
l'm not up to anything.
l just want you to be safe. l'll take the couch.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.927
The tattoo hurt at all?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.797
Yeah,

30:39.504 --> 30:40.869
it feels weird.

30:40.939 --> 30:42.270
l...

30:42.707 --> 30:45.198
l can't see it.

30:45.276 --> 30:48.370
But l feel different. lt's like...

30:49.514 --> 30:52.176
l don't know how l feel about that.

31:01.092 --> 31:02.116
Yeah...

31:12.837 --> 31:14.828
lt looks all right.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.936
Ed, you're bleeding again.

31:20.011 --> 31:23.879
Will you let me take a look at it?
l am a doctor.

31:24.515 --> 31:27.109
He said this could happen.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.188
Ed, it looks burned.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.260
Get her hands off of me!

31:43.735 --> 31:47.136
Those are bad thoughts
you're having, baby.

31:47.205 --> 31:50.402
You kiss her, and she's dead.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.435
Adams lnn.

32:26.511 --> 32:29.571
- Dana Scully, please.
- Thank you. l'll ring.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.389
l'm sorry, sir. There's no answer in that room.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.152
Thank you.

33:39.884 --> 33:44.912
l'm Detective Gouveia. This is Detective
Smith. May we speak with Edward Jerse?

33:44.989 --> 33:48.117
l'm sorry. He's not in.
l don't know where he is.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.218
- Were you here the night before last?
- No.

33:52.997 --> 33:56.262
Can l help you with something?
l'm with the Bureau.

34:06.377 --> 34:09.141
The resident downstairs,
Kaye Schilling, is missing.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.080
Some blood was found in her apartment,
not hers.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.983
lt had some... abnormalities.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.884
Such as?

34:18.188 --> 34:20.885
l have a background in forensic medicine.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.860
Anything you divulge to me will
be held under strictest confidence.

34:24.929 --> 34:29.730
A preliminary toxicology report found
this substance in the blood stains.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.429
The blood type was A, and hers was O.

34:35.273 --> 34:36.864
May l?

34:44.081 --> 34:48.746
Here's our card. We'd appreciate
Mr Jerse giving us a call when he returns.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.879
And if he doesn't, we will.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.935
- FBl.
- Yeah, Fox Mulder, please.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.441
One moment.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.849
Good morning.

36:37.562 --> 36:39.496
What's wrong?

36:40.164 --> 36:41.654
Ed, sit down.

36:58.883 --> 37:04.253
Some detectives were here. The woman in the
apartment downstairs was reported missing.

37:04.322 --> 37:07.917
They found blood,
and l believe it may be yours.

37:07.992 --> 37:11.257
l was helping her move in,
and l cut myself.

37:11.329 --> 37:14.025
You need to tell that to the detectives.

37:14.098 --> 37:18.660
But what l'm also afraid of,
and this concerns both of us,

37:18.736 --> 37:22.069
is that an ergot alkaloid
was found in the blood,

37:22.139 --> 37:25.108
which is why l think it may have been yours.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.408
Ergot is a parasite
that lives off of rye and related grasses.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.576
Svo said that he used rye somehow
in his ink.

37:33.651 --> 37:38.588
lf this is true, we may be subject
to hallucinogenic ergotism.

37:39.490 --> 37:42.857
Aural, visual hallucinations,

37:42.927 --> 37:45.691
dangerous and unlikely behavior.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.627
We need to go to the hospital to be tested.

37:49.700 --> 37:52.567
l don't need that, Dana.

37:55.673 --> 37:59.006
lt's such a relief to be able to tell someone.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.903
l hear it, Dana,

38:03.147 --> 38:05.877
in my head, only deeper.

38:07.251 --> 38:10.743
lt's more than just some chemical reaction.

38:14.325 --> 38:16.350
She talks to me.

38:19.163 --> 38:21.154
She hates women.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.500
My wife, my boss, you.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.403
She's so jealous, Dana.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.806
She makes me do things

38:34.278 --> 38:36.542
l don't want to.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.707
But she controls me.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.310
But l believe that you

38:43.521 --> 38:45.580
made her go away.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.893
We need to get help.

38:51.195 --> 38:53.789
l'm gonna go into the other room,

38:54.498 --> 38:58.400
and l'm gonna come back,
and we are gonna go together.

39:25.262 --> 39:27.059
Who'd she call?

39:27.131 --> 39:29.258
Who'd she call, Eddie?

39:29.333 --> 39:32.962
Come on! Aren't you just dyin' to know?

39:47.485 --> 39:49.646
FBl.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.951
- Dana Scully.
- Dana Scully.

39:53.023 --> 39:53.990
One moment.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.530
All right, let's go.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.156
Never again!

40:28.893 --> 40:35.059
Another woman in my bed?
Burn the sheets, lover. Burn her. Burn her!

41:14.271 --> 41:17.399
Come on, baby. Come on, baby!

41:17.475 --> 41:18.999
Do it for me.

41:23.581 --> 41:25.845
- This isn't you, Ed!
- Go on, Eddie!

41:25.916 --> 41:29.682
- Get control of yourself.
- But it's good to lose control.

41:29.753 --> 41:33.382
- Take control!
- Do it for me, Eddie! Do it!

42:10.227 --> 42:12.559
Welcome back.

42:12.630 --> 42:15.531
You look better than you did in the hospital.

42:15.599 --> 42:21.504
And congratulations for making a personal
appearance in the X-Files for the second time.

42:21.572 --> 42:23.563
lt's a world record.

42:24.542 --> 42:29.002
Ed Jerse is in custody
at the St John's Burn Center in Philadelphia.

42:29.079 --> 42:31.877
Ergot was found in his bloodstream,
and yours,

42:31.949 --> 42:35.942
but not to the degree that should cause
hallucinogenic ergotism.

42:36.020 --> 42:40.719
He'll undergo psychiatric evaluation
after recovering from burn trauma.

42:40.791 --> 42:43.351
Comrade Svo has been shut down

42:43.427 --> 42:46.988
and is under investigation
for having links to Pudovkin.

42:47.064 --> 42:49.760
Case closed on Boris Badenov,
which is a shame,

42:49.833 --> 42:52.961
because l was gonna have
an NY tattooed on my ass

42:53.037 --> 42:56.803
to commemorate
the Yankees World Series victory.

42:56.874 --> 42:59.570
Better late than never, huh?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.352
The

43:10.988 --> 43:13.980
field office in Dallas is

43:16.126 --> 43:19.289
receiving reports of an image
of a missing child

43:19.363 --> 43:22.799
appearing on a blank billboard
outside of Arlington.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.333
So...

43:26.403 --> 43:28.394
All this because l...

43:28.806 --> 43:31.400
because l didn't get you a desk?

43:35.713 --> 43:38.841
Not everything is about you, Mulder.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.244
This is my life.

43:42.119 --> 43:44.383
Yes, but it's...
