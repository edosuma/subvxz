03:52.075 --> 03:55.010
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

03:56.212 --> 03:57.645
Do you speak English?

03:57.913 --> 03:58.743
Yeah.

03:58.948 --> 04:01.679
No. I'm sorry,
my German is not very good.

04:06.689 --> 04:08.590
Have you heard that
as couples get older

04:08.791 --> 04:11.259
they lose their ability
to hear each other?

04:11.461 --> 04:12.611
No.

04:13.262 --> 04:17.197
Supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear high-pitched sounds...

04:17.399 --> 04:19.390
and women lose hearing
in the low end.

04:20.336 --> 04:22.201
I guess they nullify each other.

04:22.405 --> 04:25.567
I guess. Nature's way of allowing
couples to grow old together...

04:25.775 --> 04:27.639
without killing each other.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.144
What are you reading?

04:32.215 --> 04:33.511
Oh, yeah.

04:34.617 --> 04:35.767
How about you?

04:53.468 --> 04:56.459
I was thinking about going
to the lounge car.

04:56.805 --> 04:59.706
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

05:00.609 --> 05:01.907
Okay.

05:21.429 --> 05:23.420
How do you speak such good English?

05:23.631 --> 05:26.293
I went to school for a summer
in Los Angeles.

05:26.835 --> 05:29.064
- It's fine here?
- Yeah, this is good.

05:29.805 --> 05:32.239
And I spent some time in London.

05:33.441 --> 05:36.205
- Wow.
- How do you speak such good English?

05:36.410 --> 05:38.071
Me? I'm American.

05:38.379 --> 05:41.348
- You're American? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.576
No, I'm joking.
I knew you were American.

05:45.820 --> 05:48.413
And you don't speak
any other language, right?

05:49.090 --> 05:50.888
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

05:51.092 --> 05:53.287
I'm the crude, dumb,
vulgar American...

05:53.495 --> 05:58.227
who doesn't speak other languages,
who has no culture. But I tried.

05:58.432 --> 06:02.062
I took French in high school.
When I first got to Paris...

06:02.269 --> 06:04.635
I stood in line
at the metro station.

06:04.838 --> 06:06.032
I was practicing.

06:10.711 --> 06:11.861
Whatever.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.475
And I get up there,
and I look at this woman...

06:18.685 --> 06:23.622
and my mind goes blank. And I say,
"I need a ticket to get to..."

06:23.824 --> 06:25.291
So anyway...

06:26.860 --> 06:28.521
So where are you headed?

06:28.996 --> 06:30.792
Well, back to Paris.

06:30.997 --> 06:34.297
- My classes start next week.
- You're still in school? Where?

06:35.034 --> 06:36.592
La Sorbonne. You know?

06:36.804 --> 06:37.954
Sure.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.397
You're coming from Budapest?

06:41.608 --> 06:44.634
- I was visiting my grandmother.
- Oh. How is she?

06:45.879 --> 06:47.369
She's okay.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.741
- She's all right?
- She's fine.

06:50.817 --> 06:54.082
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

06:54.287 --> 06:55.437
Vienna?
What's there?

06:55.622 --> 06:57.817
No idea.
I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

06:58.024 --> 06:59.583
You're on holiday?

07:03.629 --> 07:06.155
I don't really know what I'm on.
You know?

07:06.432 --> 07:10.663
I've just been traveling around,
riding trains for two or three weeks.

07:10.870 --> 07:13.771
You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

07:14.507 --> 07:16.497
I had a friend in Madrid, but...

07:16.709 --> 07:19.233
- Madrid, that's nice.
- I got a Eurail pass...

07:19.445 --> 07:20.595
is what I did.

07:20.747 --> 07:21.897
That's great.

07:22.281 --> 07:26.650
So has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

07:26.853 --> 07:29.753
Yeah, sure. It's been...
It sucked.

07:30.423 --> 07:31.650
What?

07:33.725 --> 07:34.875
It's had its...

07:35.160 --> 07:38.597
I'll tell you, sitting for weeks on end
looking out the window...

07:38.798 --> 07:41.061
has actually been kind of great.

07:42.534 --> 07:44.092
What do you mean?

07:45.070 --> 07:47.037
Well, you know, for instance...

07:47.240 --> 07:50.675
you have ideas that you
ordinarily wouldn't have.

07:50.876 --> 07:52.902
- What kind of ideas?
- Want to hear one?

07:53.111 --> 07:55.103
- Tell me.
- All right.

07:55.313 --> 07:58.249
I have this idea, okay,
for a television show.

07:58.450 --> 08:01.146
Some friends of mine
are cable-access producers.

08:01.353 --> 08:02.944
Do you know what that is?

08:04.389 --> 08:08.189
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on.

08:08.393 --> 08:12.557
I have this idea for a show that lasts
24 hours a day for a year straight.

08:12.764 --> 08:13.991
What you do is you get...

08:14.198 --> 08:18.532
365 people from cities
all over the world...

08:18.737 --> 08:21.728
to do these 24-hour documents
of real time.

08:21.939 --> 08:24.533
Capturing life as it's lived.

08:24.743 --> 08:28.701
You know, it would start with a guy
waking up in the morning...

08:28.914 --> 08:30.937
and taking the long shower...

08:31.148 --> 08:34.879
eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee...

08:35.086 --> 08:36.236
reading the paper...

08:36.421 --> 08:38.479
Wait. All those mundane,
boring things...

08:38.688 --> 08:41.715
everybody has to do every day
of their fucking life?

08:41.927 --> 08:44.019
I was going to say,
"The poetry of day-to-day life."

08:44.227 --> 08:46.720
You say it your way.
I'll say it my way.

08:46.931 --> 08:48.921
- Think of it like this...
- Who's gonna watch?

08:49.133 --> 08:53.263
Think about it like this. Why is it
that a dog sleeping in the sun...

08:53.637 --> 08:56.129
is so beautiful?
It is. It's beautiful.

08:56.340 --> 08:58.933
But a guy taking money
from a bank machine...

08:59.143 --> 09:01.168
looks like a complete moron?

09:01.378 --> 09:05.577
<i>So it's like a National Geographic
program, but on people.</i>

09:05.783 --> 09:06.933
Yeah.

09:07.752 --> 09:08.650
What do you think?

09:08.852 --> 09:12.721
Yeah, I can see it.
Like, 24 boring hours... Sorry...

09:12.923 --> 09:16.381
and a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after.

09:17.727 --> 09:20.629
Yeah, and that would
be a great episode.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.230
People would talk about that episode.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.301
You and your friends could
do one in Paris if you wanted.

09:27.504 --> 09:32.305
I don't know. The key, the thing
that haunts me is the distribution.

09:32.509 --> 09:36.446
Getting these tapes from town to town
so it would play continuously.

09:36.646 --> 09:41.310
Because it would have to play all
the time, or it just wouldn't work.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.483
Thank you.

09:45.021 --> 09:46.171
Thanks.

09:47.856 --> 09:50.791
You know what?
Not service oriented.

09:51.928 --> 09:54.761
Just an observation about Europe.

10:02.604 --> 10:05.971
My parents never really
spoke of the possibility...

10:06.175 --> 10:09.736
of my falling in love or
getting married or having children.

10:10.212 --> 10:12.077
Even as a little girl...

10:12.282 --> 10:15.739
they wanted me to think as
a future career as a, you know...

10:15.952 --> 10:19.149
interior designer or lawyer
or something like that.

10:19.355 --> 10:22.154
I'd say to my dad,
"I want to be a writer."

10:22.358 --> 10:24.087
And he'd say, "Journalist."

10:24.294 --> 10:28.821
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for
stray cats. He'd say, "Veterinarian."

10:29.032 --> 10:32.660
I'd say I wanted to be an actress.
He'd say, "TV newscaster."

10:32.869 --> 10:36.860
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition into these...

10:37.072 --> 10:39.403
practical moneymaking ventures.

10:41.109 --> 10:44.237
I had a good bullshit detector
when I was a kid.

10:44.446 --> 10:46.937
I always knew
when they were lying to me.

10:47.149 --> 10:49.174
By high school, I was dead set...

10:49.384 --> 10:53.582
on listening to what everybody
thought I should do with my life...

10:53.789 --> 10:55.586
and doing the opposite.

10:56.692 --> 11:01.356
Nobody was ever mean about it.
I just could never get very excited...

11:01.563 --> 11:04.725
about other people's ambitions
for my life.

11:05.199 --> 11:07.963
But you know what?
If your parents never...

11:08.169 --> 11:11.833
fully contradict you about anything
and are nice and supportive...

11:12.039 --> 11:13.189
Right.

11:13.574 --> 11:16.337
It makes it even harder
to officially complain.

11:16.545 --> 11:20.412
Even when they're wrong,
it's this passive-aggressive shit.

11:20.615 --> 11:22.014
You know what I mean?

11:22.216 --> 11:23.479
I hate it.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.477
I really hate it.

11:25.686 --> 11:29.486
Well, you know, despite all that
kind of bullshit...

11:29.689 --> 11:31.351
that comes along with it...

11:31.926 --> 11:34.724
I remember childhood as...

11:35.596 --> 11:37.621
this magical time.

11:37.832 --> 11:42.769
I do. I remember when my mother
first told me about death.

11:43.037 --> 11:47.735
My great-grandmother had died, and my
family had visited them in Florida.

11:47.942 --> 11:50.000
I was about 3, 31/2 years old.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.645
Anyway, I was in
the back yard playing...

11:53.848 --> 11:57.443
and my sister had just taught me
how to take the garden hose...

11:57.651 --> 11:59.812
and do it in such a way that...

12:00.654 --> 12:03.783
it sprayed into the sun
and would make a rainbow.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.157
And so I was doing that...

12:07.395 --> 12:10.522
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.029
And she was just standing there,
smiling at me.

12:14.235 --> 12:17.396
And I held it there for a long time...

12:17.604 --> 12:19.401
and I looked at her.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.871
And then finally, I let go
of the nozzle, you know?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.044
And then I dropped the hose...

12:25.345 --> 12:26.971
and she disappeared.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.543
And so I run back inside
and tell my parents.

12:30.884 --> 12:35.253
And they sit me down
and give me this big rap on how...

12:36.089 --> 12:40.550
when people die, you never see
them again, and how I'd imagined it.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.285
But I knew what I'd seen.
I was glad I saw that.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.456
I've never seen anything
like that since. But I don't know.

12:47.666 --> 12:51.728
It just kind of let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.371
Even death.

12:54.807 --> 12:58.039
You're lucky you can have
this attitude toward death.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.910
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.552
I swear. I mean, that's why
I'm in a train right now.

13:06.753 --> 13:09.414
I could've flown to Paris,
but I'm scared.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.921
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.525
I know the statistics say,
"Na, Na, Na, it's safer." Whatever.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.856
When I'm in a plane,
I can see the explosion.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.362
I can see me falling
through the clouds.

13:21.567 --> 13:25.832
And I'm so scared of those
few seconds of consciousness...

13:26.038 --> 13:29.439
before you die.
When you know you're gonna die.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.643
I can't stop thinking that way.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.280
It's exhausting.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.039
Yeah, I bet.

13:38.249 --> 13:40.047
Really exhausting.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.422
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

13:47.626 --> 13:50.458
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah, what a drag.

13:50.929 --> 13:54.365
I wish I'd met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

13:55.601 --> 13:56.898
Yeah, me too.

13:57.669 --> 13:59.830
It was really nice of you too.

14:31.169 --> 14:34.934
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this...

14:35.139 --> 14:37.163
it'll haunt me the rest of my life.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.525
What?

14:41.378 --> 14:46.078
I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is...

14:46.583 --> 14:49.018
but I feel like we have
some kind of...

14:49.219 --> 14:50.653
connection. Right?

14:50.887 --> 14:52.037
Yeah. Me too.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.255
Right. Great.
Here's the deal.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.859
Get off here in Vienna
and come check out the town.

14:58.062 --> 14:59.722
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun.

15:00.131 --> 15:01.860
- Come on.
- What would we do?

15:02.065 --> 15:06.661
I don't know. All I know is I catch
a flight tomorrow morning at 9:30...

15:06.870 --> 15:10.237
and I can't afford a hotel,
so I was going to walk around...

15:10.440 --> 15:12.306
and it'd be more fun
if you came with me.

15:12.509 --> 15:16.240
And if I turn out to be a psycho,
just get on the next train.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.677
All right, all right.
Think of it like this.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.778
Jump ahead 10, 20 years, okay?

15:23.986 --> 15:25.148
And you're married.

15:25.355 --> 15:29.188
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy it used to have.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.388
You start to blame your husband.

15:31.595 --> 15:34.530
You think about all those guys
you've met in your life...

15:34.730 --> 15:38.394
and what might've happened
if you'd picked up with one of them.

15:38.602 --> 15:40.593
I'm one of those guys.
That's me.

15:40.803 --> 15:42.668
So think of this as time travel...

15:42.871 --> 15:46.808
from then to now to find out
what you're missing out on.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.307
What this could be is
a gigantic favor...

15:49.512 --> 15:53.142
to you and your husband to find out
you're not missing anything.

15:53.350 --> 15:56.341
I'm just as big a loser as he is.
Unmotivated. Boring.

15:56.553 --> 15:59.179
You made the right choice.
You're happy.

16:05.761 --> 16:07.524
Let me get my bag.

16:34.022 --> 16:36.321
We should get a locker for all this.

16:41.362 --> 16:42.557
What's your name?

16:42.765 --> 16:43.915
My name?

16:44.099 --> 16:47.627
Jesse. James, actually,
but everybody calls me Jesse.

16:47.836 --> 16:49.997
You mean, Jesse James, no?

16:50.205 --> 16:51.503
No. No, just Jesse.

16:51.706 --> 16:52.856
I'm Celine.

17:07.255 --> 17:08.881
This is a nice bridge.

17:09.089 --> 17:10.352
Yeah.

17:14.695 --> 17:16.288
This is kind of weird.

17:16.498 --> 17:19.227
Isn't it? I mean,
I feel a little awkward.

17:20.435 --> 17:23.232
- But it's all right. Right?
- Yeah, this is great.

17:23.436 --> 17:27.204
- Let's go to some places.
- Yeah, let's go to some places.

17:27.406 --> 17:28.897
- Let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

17:29.109 --> 17:31.476
Excuse me. Excuse me?

17:31.678 --> 17:33.407
Do you speak English?

17:33.615 --> 17:37.073
- Yes, of course.
- Do you speak German for a change?

17:37.284 --> 17:39.082
- What?
- No, it was a joke.

17:39.287 --> 17:43.086
We just got into Vienna today, and
we're looking for something fun to do.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.019
Like museums, exhibitions...

17:45.225 --> 17:48.662
But museums are not that
funny anymore these days.

17:48.862 --> 17:53.162
They are closing right now.
How long are you going to be here?

17:53.368 --> 17:54.562
Just for tonight.

17:54.935 --> 17:57.903
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.106
We're on honeymoon.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.402
Yeah, she got pregnant,
we had to get married...

18:05.611 --> 18:08.080
I don't believe you.
You're a bad liar.

18:13.587 --> 18:17.956
This is a play we're both in.
We would like to invite you.

18:18.157 --> 18:19.454
You're actors?

18:19.660 --> 18:21.855
Not professional.
Part-time for fun.

18:22.062 --> 18:25.190
It's a play about a cow and
Indians searching for it.

18:25.399 --> 18:27.958
There are also
politicians, Mexicans...

18:28.168 --> 18:30.101
Russians, communists...

18:30.636 --> 18:34.266
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, an actor in a cow costume.

18:34.473 --> 18:36.373
- He's the cow.
- Yes, I am the cow.

18:36.576 --> 18:39.705
- And the cow's a bit weird.
- The cow has a disease.

18:39.913 --> 18:42.312
She's acting a bit strange.
Like a dog.

18:42.516 --> 18:45.142
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it.

18:45.351 --> 18:48.581
And she can smoke with hoofs
and everything.

18:49.121 --> 18:51.611
- Great.
- As you see, there is the address.

18:51.824 --> 18:53.553
It's in the second district.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.351
Near the Prater. You know it?

18:55.561 --> 18:58.495
The big Ferris wheel?
We should go. We should.

18:58.699 --> 19:01.223
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play.

19:01.434 --> 19:04.267
It starts at 2130.

19:04.704 --> 19:06.763
- 2130?
- It's at 9:30.

19:06.974 --> 19:08.997
- 9:30.
- Oh, right.

19:09.275 --> 19:10.935
What's the name of this play?

19:11.142 --> 19:15.238
It translates as "Bring Me the Horns
of Wilmington's Cow."

19:15.448 --> 19:16.598
I'm Wilmington's cow.

19:17.048 --> 19:18.516
- All right.
- Great.

19:18.718 --> 19:19.868
- You'll be there?
- We'll try.

19:20.018 --> 19:21.815
I'm the cow.

19:22.054 --> 19:23.204
Goodbye.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.072
I got an idea. Are you ready?

19:46.277 --> 19:48.940
It's Q and A time.
We've known each other a little while.

19:49.147 --> 19:53.139
We're stuck together, so we'll ask
each other a few direct questions.

19:53.418 --> 19:54.568
All right?

19:54.853 --> 19:58.754
- We ask each other questions?
- And you have to answer honestly.

19:58.957 --> 20:00.720
- Of course.
- Okay.

20:00.925 --> 20:02.723
All right, first question.

20:02.927 --> 20:05.122
- You.
- Yes, I am going to ask you.

20:05.330 --> 20:09.061
Describe for me your
first sexual feelings...

20:09.267 --> 20:11.360
towards a person.

20:12.237 --> 20:14.603
My first sexual feelings?
Oh, my God.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.569
I know. I know.

20:18.809 --> 20:20.505
Jean-Marc Fleury.

20:21.211 --> 20:22.872
Jean-Marc Fleury?

20:23.348 --> 20:27.113
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

20:27.751 --> 20:30.721
He had bleached-out
chlorine hair and green eyes...

20:30.921 --> 20:34.187
and to improve his times,
he'd shave his legs and arms.

20:34.391 --> 20:37.827
- That's disgusting.
- He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.258
My friend Emma
had a big crush on him.

20:40.464 --> 20:43.900
So one day, I was cutting across
the field back to my room...

20:44.101 --> 20:46.831
and he came walking up beside me.
I told him...

20:47.037 --> 20:50.438
"You should date Emma.
She has a big crush on you."

20:50.641 --> 20:52.200
And he turned to me and said...

20:52.408 --> 20:56.277
"Well, that's too bad, because
I have a big crush on you."

20:56.480 --> 20:59.643
So, yeah, it really scared
the hell out of me...

20:59.850 --> 21:02.045
because I thought he was so fine.

21:02.286 --> 21:07.223
Then he officially asked me on a date.
I pretended I didn't like him.

21:08.358 --> 21:12.762
You know, I was so afraid of
what I might do, you know.

21:14.430 --> 21:17.866
So I went to see him swim
a few times at the competition.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.094
And he was so sexy. Really.
I mean, really sexy.

21:21.305 --> 21:25.799
We wrote these little declarations
of love at the end of the summer...

21:26.009 --> 21:29.410
and, you know, promised we would
keep writing forever...

21:29.612 --> 21:31.877
and meet again very soon and...

21:32.081 --> 21:33.231
Did you?

21:33.517 --> 21:34.847
Of course not.

21:35.284 --> 21:39.914
Then this is the opportune time
to tell you I'm a fantastic swimmer.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.720
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.958
- I make note of that.
- Okay.

21:45.161 --> 21:47.629
- So it's my turn. No?
- Yes, your turn.

21:47.829 --> 21:49.059
Hit me.

21:50.967 --> 21:52.764
Have you ever been in love?

21:54.637 --> 21:55.534
Yes.

21:55.738 --> 21:56.888
Next question.

21:57.573 --> 21:59.130
- What was the...
- Wait a minute.

21:59.342 --> 22:01.708
- So I can give one-word answers?
- Why not?

22:01.911 --> 22:04.777
After I went into detail
about my sexual feelings?

22:04.981 --> 22:09.440
They're different questions. I could
answer the sexual-feelings thing.

22:09.652 --> 22:13.348
But, you know, love... I mean,
what if I asked you about love?

22:13.556 --> 22:17.321
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

22:17.526 --> 22:20.120
Love is a complex issue, you know?

22:20.328 --> 22:25.061
I mean, yes, I've told somebody
that I love them, and I've meant it.

22:25.267 --> 22:28.498
But was it totally unselfish,
giving love?

22:28.702 --> 22:30.603
Was it a beautiful thing?

22:30.805 --> 22:33.866
Not really.
You know, it's like, love...

22:34.476 --> 22:36.273
I mean, I don't know.

22:36.912 --> 22:38.062
You know?

22:39.014 --> 22:42.609
- Yeah. I know what you mean.
- But as far as sexual feelings go...

22:42.817 --> 22:45.685
it started with
an obsessive relationship...

22:45.886 --> 22:48.912
<i>with Miss July, 1978.
Do you know Playboy magazine?</i>

22:49.124 --> 22:51.455
- I've heard of it.
- You know Crystal?

22:51.859 --> 22:54.385
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

22:56.597 --> 22:58.225
Is it my turn now?

22:58.600 --> 23:01.124
Tell me something that
really pisses you off.

23:01.335 --> 23:03.895
- Really drives you crazy.
- Pisses me off.

23:04.105 --> 23:06.870
- God, everything pisses me off.
- List a couple.

23:08.109 --> 23:11.443
Oh, I know. I hate being told
by strange men...

23:11.645 --> 23:13.511
strange men in the street...

23:13.715 --> 23:18.515
you know, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

23:19.086 --> 23:20.236
What else?

23:20.354 --> 23:21.686
I hate...

23:21.890 --> 23:25.381
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,
there's a war...

23:25.594 --> 23:27.788
people are dying,
and nobody knows what to do.

23:27.995 --> 23:30.293
Or they don't give a shit.
I don't know.

23:30.498 --> 23:34.127
I hate that the media's
trying to control our minds.

23:34.336 --> 23:35.962
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

23:36.170 --> 23:39.696
It's very subtle, but it's
a new form of fascism, really.

23:41.610 --> 23:42.760
I hate...

23:43.644 --> 23:47.171
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America...

23:47.380 --> 23:51.943
each time I wear black or lose my
temper or say anything about anything...

23:52.152 --> 23:55.418
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French. It's so cute."

23:55.623 --> 23:58.989
I hate that.
I can't stand that. Really.

24:00.094 --> 24:01.244
Is that all?

24:01.395 --> 24:03.885
Well, there's a lot of things, but...

24:04.097 --> 24:06.566
- So it's my turn.
- Okay.

24:06.866 --> 24:09.096
- You're gonna answer.
- Yes, I'll answer.

24:09.302 --> 24:11.031
What's a problem for you?

24:11.704 --> 24:13.070
You, probably.

24:13.339 --> 24:14.489
What?

24:15.241 --> 24:18.074
I had a thought the other day
that kind of...

24:18.278 --> 24:20.075
qualifies as a problem.

24:20.381 --> 24:21.404
What is it?

24:21.614 --> 24:24.583
It was a thought I had
on the train, so...

24:24.784 --> 24:26.445
Okay. All right.

24:26.686 --> 24:28.517
Do you believe in reincarnation?

24:28.755 --> 24:30.745
Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting.

24:30.990 --> 24:35.188
A lot of people talk about past
lives and things like that, you know?

24:35.396 --> 24:38.853
And even if they don't believe in it
in some specific way...

24:39.065 --> 24:41.363
people have a notion
of an eternal soul.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.465
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:42.669 --> 24:45.160
This is my thought:
50,000 years ago...

24:45.370 --> 24:47.339
there's not even a million people.

24:47.539 --> 24:51.373
Ten thousand years ago,
there's, like, two million people.

24:51.577 --> 24:55.537
Now there's between five and six
billion people on the planet.

24:55.747 --> 24:57.272
If we all have our own...

24:57.482 --> 24:59.382
individual, unique...

24:59.651 --> 25:00.801
soul...

25:00.986 --> 25:02.783
where did they all come from?

25:02.988 --> 25:06.583
Are modern souls only
a fraction of the original souls?

25:06.793 --> 25:10.785
If they are, that represents
a 5000 to 1 split of each soul...

25:10.997 --> 25:14.727
in the last 50,000 years, which is
a blip in the Earth's time.

25:14.933 --> 25:18.198
So at best, we're these
tiny fractions...

25:18.570 --> 25:19.867
of people walking...

25:20.073 --> 25:24.406
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're so specialized?

25:24.609 --> 25:26.167
Wait a minute, I'm not sure...

25:26.378 --> 25:29.836
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's a totally scattered thought.

25:30.849 --> 25:32.976
Which is kind of why it makes sense.

25:33.517 --> 25:35.348
I agree with you.

25:36.587 --> 25:38.488
Let's get off this damn train.

26:14.191 --> 26:15.886
This place is pretty neat.

26:16.092 --> 26:17.082
Yeah.

26:17.295 --> 26:19.627
There's even a listening booth.

26:23.466 --> 26:25.697
Have you heard of this singer?

26:27.505 --> 26:29.769
I think she's American.
A friend told me about her.

26:29.974 --> 26:33.306
Do you want to go see if that
listening booth still works?

26:33.511 --> 26:34.705
Yeah, okay.

28:49.977 --> 28:51.502
Look, there's a rabbit.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.330
Yeah.

28:54.247 --> 28:55.738
Hey there, rabbit.

28:56.951 --> 28:58.316
It's so cute.

29:00.923 --> 29:03.322
I visited this as a young teenager.

29:04.225 --> 29:07.990
It left a bigger impression on me
at that time than the museums.

29:08.196 --> 29:09.993
Yeah? It's tiny.

29:10.198 --> 29:11.348
I know.

29:11.799 --> 29:14.996
A little old man talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

29:15.204 --> 29:18.036
He explained that most
of the people buried here...

29:18.239 --> 29:20.764
had washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

29:22.275 --> 29:23.742
How old are these?

29:24.245 --> 29:28.011
Around the beginning of the century.
It's called No Name Cemetery...

29:28.216 --> 29:30.809
because they often didn't know
who those people were.

29:31.017 --> 29:33.110
Maybe a first name, that's all.

29:33.453 --> 29:35.354
Why were all the bodies washing up?

29:35.555 --> 29:39.491
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.992
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

29:44.998 --> 29:48.730
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

29:48.935 --> 29:50.994
When I was a little girl,
I thought...

29:51.204 --> 29:53.729
if none of your family or friends
knew you were dead...

29:53.940 --> 29:55.908
then it's like
not really being dead.

29:56.108 --> 29:59.010
People can invent the best
and the worst for you.

30:02.517 --> 30:04.575
Here she is, I think.

30:04.851 --> 30:08.217
Yeah, this is the one
I remember the most.

30:11.191 --> 30:13.784
She was only 13 when she died.

30:14.193 --> 30:18.596
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

30:23.068 --> 30:27.870
Now I'm 10 years older,
and she's still 13, I guess.

30:29.042 --> 30:30.192
That's funny.

30:50.462 --> 30:52.521
That's the Danube over there.

30:53.032 --> 30:54.693
That's a river, right?

30:54.935 --> 30:56.085
Yeah.

31:03.909 --> 31:05.467
This is...

31:05.743 --> 31:07.108
gorgeous.

31:08.112 --> 31:10.239
Yeah, this is beautiful.

31:16.521 --> 31:17.716
I mean, we got...

31:18.090 --> 31:19.613
We got a sunset here.

31:20.558 --> 31:22.925
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel.

31:25.064 --> 31:26.826
It seems like...

31:27.633 --> 31:29.122
this would be a...

31:31.135 --> 31:32.285
What?

31:36.441 --> 31:37.591
You know...

31:42.747 --> 31:45.147
Are you trying to say
you want to kiss me?

32:54.451 --> 32:55.439
But you know what?

32:55.652 --> 32:58.586
It doesn't matter what
generation you're born into.

32:58.790 --> 33:00.051
Look at my parents.

33:00.257 --> 33:04.455
They were angry, young May '68 people
revolting against everything.

33:04.661 --> 33:08.426
The government, their conservative
Catholic backgrounds...

33:08.632 --> 33:12.123
Then I was born, and my father
became a successful architect.

33:12.334 --> 33:15.360
We traveled around the world
while he built bridges...

33:15.571 --> 33:17.801
and, you know, towers and stuff.

33:18.075 --> 33:20.872
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

33:21.078 --> 33:23.068
They love me more than anything...

33:23.280 --> 33:26.442
and I've been raised with all
the freedom they fought for.

33:26.650 --> 33:29.676
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

33:29.885 --> 33:33.218
We have to deal with the same shit,
but we can't really know...

33:33.422 --> 33:35.913
who or, you know, what the enemy is.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.958
I don't know if
there really is an enemy.

33:39.161 --> 33:41.221
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

33:41.429 --> 33:44.888
Rich kids' parents gave them too much.
Poor kids', not enough.

33:45.102 --> 33:47.466
Too much attention,
not enough attention.

33:47.670 --> 33:50.900
They either left or
taught them the wrong things.

33:51.107 --> 33:54.907
My parents are just two people
who didn't like each other much...

33:55.111 --> 33:56.976
who got married and had a kid.

33:57.179 --> 33:59.511
And they tried their best
to be nice to me.

34:00.850 --> 34:03.683
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

34:03.885 --> 34:06.115
They should have done it sooner.
They stuck together...

34:06.321 --> 34:09.985
for the well-being of my sister
and I. Thank you very much.

34:10.291 --> 34:13.726
I remember my mother told me
right in front of my father...

34:13.928 --> 34:16.454
that he didn't really
want to have me.

34:16.664 --> 34:19.964
That he was pissed off when
he found out she was pregnant.

34:20.168 --> 34:23.797
That I was a big mistake.
That really shaped the way I think.

34:24.005 --> 34:28.271
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

34:28.476 --> 34:29.466
That's so sad.

34:29.677 --> 34:32.840
Well, I mean, I eventually
kind of took pride in it.

34:33.045 --> 34:35.536
You know, like my life
was my own doing.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.878
You know, like I was
crashing the big party.

34:39.087 --> 34:41.112
That's the way to see it.

34:41.321 --> 34:44.688
My parents are still married
and I guess they're happy.

34:45.260 --> 34:49.822
But I think it's healthy to rebel
against everything that came before.

34:54.268 --> 34:56.533
You know, I've been wondering lately...

34:57.305 --> 35:00.741
do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

35:02.409 --> 35:05.402
Yeah, sure. You know,
I know happy couples.

35:06.181 --> 35:08.239
But I think they lie to each other.

35:08.950 --> 35:10.212
Yeah.

35:11.186 --> 35:13.278
People can live their
whole life as a lie.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.388
My grandmother was married...

35:15.589 --> 35:18.683
and I thought she had an
uncomplicated love life.

35:18.892 --> 35:22.919
But she just confessed to me
that she spent her whole life...

35:23.131 --> 35:26.190
dreaming about another man
she was in love with.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.730
She just accepted her fate.
It's so sad.

35:30.304 --> 35:33.068
In the same time, I love that
she had these emotions...

35:33.272 --> 35:35.605
and feelings I never
thought she had.

35:35.808 --> 35:38.039
I guarantee you
it was better that way.

35:38.245 --> 35:41.612
If she'd known him, he'd have
disappointed her eventually.

35:41.814 --> 35:44.181
- How do you know?
- I know. I know.

35:44.383 --> 35:46.943
People put romantic projections
on everything.

35:47.154 --> 35:49.850
It's not based in any kind of reality.

35:50.057 --> 35:53.753
Romantic projections?
Oh, Mr. Romantic up in the Ferris wheel?

35:53.961 --> 35:57.259
"Oh, kiss me. The sunset.
Oh, it's so beautiful."

35:57.463 --> 36:00.956
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.613
Check these guys out.

36:20.821 --> 36:25.314
"Hans, I have a confession. I'm not
wearing underwear underneath this."

36:25.525 --> 36:28.186
"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

36:34.599 --> 36:36.033
Can I tell you a secret?

36:36.401 --> 36:37.551
Yeah.

36:37.637 --> 36:38.787
Come here.

36:39.105 --> 36:40.572
- What?
- Come here.

36:54.619 --> 36:57.612
Look at this palm reader.
She's interesting looking.

36:57.822 --> 36:58.972
Yeah.

36:59.292 --> 37:00.759
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

37:01.227 --> 37:03.718
- I made eye contact.
- She's not coming over here.

37:03.929 --> 37:05.921
- Yes, she is.
- Oh, shit.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.260
Oh, no.

37:10.535 --> 37:12.526
- You want your palm read?
- No.

37:12.737 --> 37:14.899
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

37:15.105 --> 37:16.596
- Okay.
- Hello.

37:17.175 --> 37:18.506
Oh, here she is.

37:28.752 --> 37:30.687
I want your palm read.

37:33.224 --> 37:34.987
Yeah. How much is it?

37:35.427 --> 37:36.916
For you, 50.

37:37.228 --> 37:38.378
Okay?

37:38.662 --> 37:39.812
Okay.

37:46.237 --> 37:49.205
So you have been on a journey...

37:49.406 --> 37:51.375
and you're a stranger
to this place.

37:53.078 --> 37:54.044
You are...

37:54.245 --> 37:55.802
an adventurer.

37:56.247 --> 37:57.839
A seeker.

37:58.881 --> 38:00.873
An adventurer in your mind.

38:05.823 --> 38:09.123
You are interested
in the power of the woman.

38:09.326 --> 38:14.229
In the woman's deep strength
and creativity.

38:14.632 --> 38:16.963
You're becoming this woman.

38:22.206 --> 38:26.609
You need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

38:27.277 --> 38:30.678
Only if you find peace
within yourself...

38:31.348 --> 38:34.909
will you find
true connection with others.

38:38.421 --> 38:39.888
That is a stranger to you?

38:40.723 --> 38:42.055
I guess so.

38:47.831 --> 38:50.492
You will be all right.
He's learning.

38:51.299 --> 38:52.449
Okay.

38:52.902 --> 38:54.052
Money.

39:01.644 --> 39:03.578
You're both stars.

39:03.780 --> 39:05.339
Don't forget.

39:05.815 --> 39:08.875
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago...

39:09.085 --> 39:11.884
they formed everything
that is this world.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.954
Everything we know is stardust.

39:15.158 --> 39:19.094
So don't forget, you are stardust.

39:23.933 --> 39:25.560
That's very nice and all.

39:25.767 --> 39:28.100
I mean, that we're all stardust...

39:28.303 --> 39:30.738
and you're becoming this great woman.

39:31.340 --> 39:33.831
But I hope you don't take that
any more seriously...

39:34.042 --> 39:36.169
than some horoscope
in a newspaper.

39:36.379 --> 39:40.645
What? She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other...

39:40.849 --> 39:43.750
and that I was going
to become this great woman.

39:43.952 --> 39:46.318
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

39:46.521 --> 39:48.854
That's way condescending, you know?

39:49.057 --> 39:51.116
I mean, she wasn't even doing me.

39:51.360 --> 39:55.660
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth...

39:55.864 --> 39:57.922
it would put them
out of business.

39:58.133 --> 40:02.729
Just once, I'd love to see some
little old lady save up all her money...

40:02.938 --> 40:07.602
to go to the fortuneteller. She'd
get there and the woman would say...

40:09.643 --> 40:12.738
"Tomorrow and all
your remaining days...

40:12.948 --> 40:14.973
will be exactly like today...

40:15.182 --> 40:17.708
a tedious collection of hours.

40:17.918 --> 40:21.150
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts...

40:21.356 --> 40:23.755
and no new travels.

40:23.959 --> 40:26.860
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten.

40:27.828 --> 40:29.295
Fifty schillings, please."

40:29.498 --> 40:31.227
That I'd like to see.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.732
It's so funny how...

40:33.934 --> 40:37.461
she almost didn't notice you.
It's weird. I wonder why.

40:37.706 --> 40:41.835
She was really wise and intense.
I really loved what she said.

40:42.043 --> 40:45.877
You pay your money to hear what
makes you feel good about yourself.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.572
Maybe there's a seedy section of Vienna.
We can buy a hit of crack.

40:49.784 --> 40:51.307
Would you like that?

40:52.119 --> 40:53.644
You're so...

40:54.855 --> 40:56.948
Stardust. Stardust.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.162
There's an exhibition.

41:09.904 --> 41:13.236
I guess we'll miss it.
It doesn't start until next week.

41:13.741 --> 41:15.641
Yeah, I think so.

41:16.877 --> 41:20.677
I actually saw this one in a museum.

41:21.981 --> 41:23.916
I stared and stared at it.

41:24.118 --> 41:26.416
Must have been 45 minutes.

41:27.188 --> 41:28.338
I love it.

41:29.122 --> 41:31.557
<i>La voie ferrée.</i>
It's great.

41:33.326 --> 41:36.921
I love the way the people are
dissolving into the background.

41:38.331 --> 41:39.481
Look at this.

41:41.035 --> 41:42.524
It's like the environments...

41:42.969 --> 41:45.131
are stronger than the people.

41:46.806 --> 41:49.740
His human figures are
always so transitory.

41:49.944 --> 41:52.002
It's funny. Transitory?

41:52.512 --> 41:53.979
Transitory.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.057
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

42:42.394 --> 42:44.225
I was in an old church like this...

42:44.430 --> 42:47.558
with my grandmother
a few days ago in Budapest.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.501
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing...

42:52.839 --> 42:56.797
I can't help but feeling for
those people that come here...

42:57.009 --> 43:00.273
lost or in pain, guilt...

43:01.014 --> 43:03.344
looking for some kind of answers.

43:04.850 --> 43:08.513
It fascinates me how a single place
can join pain and happiness...

43:08.720 --> 43:11.052
of so many generations.

43:11.657 --> 43:13.749
You're close with your grandmother?

43:15.527 --> 43:16.677
Yeah.

43:18.996 --> 43:22.694
I think it's because I always
have this strange feeling...

43:22.901 --> 43:26.893
that I'm this very old woman
laying down, about to die.

43:28.507 --> 43:30.701
You know, that my life is just...

43:31.008 --> 43:32.737
her memories or something.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.109
That's so wild.

43:40.151 --> 43:43.746
I always think that I'm still
this 13-year-old boy...

43:43.955 --> 43:47.047
who doesn't really know how
to be an adult, pretending to...

43:47.258 --> 43:51.751
live my life, taking notes for when
I'll really have to do it.

43:52.129 --> 43:55.030
Like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.958
That's funny.

43:59.770 --> 44:02.068
Then up there in the Ferris wheel,
it was like...

44:02.273 --> 44:06.334
this very old woman
kissing this very young boy. Right?

44:11.147 --> 44:15.209
Do you know anything about
the Quakers, the Quaker religion?

44:15.653 --> 44:16.803
No, not much.

44:17.621 --> 44:20.248
Well, I went to
this Quaker wedding once...

44:20.458 --> 44:22.322
and it was fantastic.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.820
What they do is...

44:24.027 --> 44:28.293
the couple comes in and they kneel
in front of the whole congregation...

44:28.498 --> 44:30.022
and they stare at each other.

44:31.202 --> 44:35.160
Nobody says a word unless they feel
that God moves them to speak...

44:35.372 --> 44:37.033
or say something.

44:37.974 --> 44:40.636
And then, after an hour or so of just...

44:42.112 --> 44:43.943
staring at each other...

44:44.414 --> 44:45.779
they're married.

44:47.716 --> 44:49.776
That's beautiful. I like that.

45:06.569 --> 45:08.059
This is a horrible story.

45:09.138 --> 45:10.288
What?

45:10.707 --> 45:13.072
It's not the appropriate place
to tell it.

45:13.275 --> 45:16.210
Well, I was driving around
with this buddy of mine.

45:16.413 --> 45:18.313
He's a big atheist, you know.

45:18.515 --> 45:21.381
And he came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

45:21.650 --> 45:23.881
My buddy takes out a $ 100 bill...

45:24.087 --> 45:25.484
and leans out the window...

45:25.688 --> 45:28.951
and he says,
"Do you believe in God?"

45:29.792 --> 45:33.524
And the guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money.

45:33.796 --> 45:35.697
He says...

45:36.065 --> 45:37.725
"Yes, I do."

45:37.932 --> 45:39.867
My friend says, "Wrong answer."

45:40.068 --> 45:41.558
We drove away.

45:42.404 --> 45:43.894
That's mean.

45:55.184 --> 45:59.017
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train?

45:59.487 --> 46:01.148
No, not yet.

46:02.291 --> 46:03.518
What would you be doing?

46:03.724 --> 46:06.387
I'd probably be hanging around
the airport...

46:06.595 --> 46:09.961
crying in my coffee
because you didn't come with me.

46:14.068 --> 46:17.835
I'd probably gotten off the train
in Salzburg with someone else.

46:18.039 --> 46:20.008
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

46:20.208 --> 46:22.109
So I'm just a dumb American...

46:22.310 --> 46:26.440
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

46:26.681 --> 46:29.809
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

46:30.017 --> 46:31.245
Me too.

46:33.054 --> 46:35.023
I'm glad, because
no one knows I'm here.

46:35.223 --> 46:37.214
I don't know anyone
that would tell me...

46:37.425 --> 46:39.518
all those bad things you've done.

46:39.727 --> 46:42.059
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

46:43.064 --> 46:47.058
You hear so much shit about people.
I always feel like...

46:47.267 --> 46:49.668
the general of an army
when I start dating.

46:49.871 --> 46:51.963
Plotting my strategy
and maneuverings...

46:52.173 --> 46:55.701
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

46:56.010 --> 46:57.442
It's horrible.

47:01.748 --> 47:03.511
If we were always around each other...

47:03.718 --> 47:07.518
what would be the first thing
about me that would drive you mad?

47:08.255 --> 47:11.223
No. I'm not going to
answer this question.

47:11.425 --> 47:14.518
I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

47:14.728 --> 47:16.321
"What about me bugs you?"

47:16.530 --> 47:20.227
Finally I said, "I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

47:20.434 --> 47:23.527
She flew into a rage and
broke up with me. That's true.

47:23.737 --> 47:25.864
All she wanted was
to have an excuse...

47:26.073 --> 47:28.768
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

47:28.974 --> 47:30.203
Is that what you want?

47:30.410 --> 47:32.139
Something about me bugs you?

47:32.647 --> 47:35.547
- What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

47:35.749 --> 47:38.217
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

47:38.585 --> 47:42.077
If it had to be something,
if I had to think about it...

47:42.289 --> 47:45.884
I kind of didn't really like this
reaction at the palm reader.

47:46.092 --> 47:48.457
You were like this rooster prick.

47:48.661 --> 47:50.526
What the hell
is a rooster prick?

47:50.731 --> 47:52.220
You were like a boy whining...

47:52.432 --> 47:55.093
because all the attention
wasn't focused on him.

47:55.302 --> 47:58.396
All right, listen.
This woman robs you blind, okay?

47:58.604 --> 48:00.937
You were like a boy
walking by an ice-cream store...

48:01.140 --> 48:03.904
crying because his mom
won't buy him a milk shake.

48:04.109 --> 48:07.169
I don't care what this charlatan
has to say about...

48:09.382 --> 48:10.532
What?

48:13.420 --> 48:15.853
I understand a little,
but he doesn't at all.

48:19.859 --> 48:21.415
May I ask you a question?

48:23.763 --> 48:26.663
So I would like to
make a deal with you.

48:28.566 --> 48:32.765
I mean, instead of just asking you
for money, I will ask you for a word.

48:33.272 --> 48:37.572
You give me a word, I take the word,
and then I will write a poem...

48:37.810 --> 48:39.277
with the word inside.

48:40.512 --> 48:42.980
And if you like it,
if you like my poem...

48:43.381 --> 48:45.942
if it adds something to
your life in any way...

48:46.151 --> 48:48.778
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

48:49.455 --> 48:51.445
I'll write in English, of course.

48:52.690 --> 48:54.385
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

48:56.961 --> 48:58.111
So?

49:00.198 --> 49:01.461
Pick a word.

49:03.334 --> 49:04.484
A word.

49:05.969 --> 49:08.234
- Milk shake.
- Milk shake? Oh, good.

49:08.440 --> 49:11.340
I was gonna say "rooster prick."
But great. Milk shake.

49:11.543 --> 49:12.975
"Milk shake"?

49:13.511 --> 49:15.308
Okay, milk shake.

49:15.979 --> 49:17.972
- All right, so...
- Good.

49:29.027 --> 49:33.259
I gotta say, I like this
Viennese variation of bum.

49:33.465 --> 49:36.557
I like what he said about
adding something to your life.

49:36.768 --> 49:40.568
So, were we having
our first fight back there?

49:42.006 --> 49:44.099
I think so. I think we were.

49:44.341 --> 49:47.903
Even if we were, why does everyone
think conflict is so bad?

49:48.112 --> 49:50.945
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

49:51.148 --> 49:52.877
Yeah, I guess so.

49:53.283 --> 49:56.515
I always think if I could
just accept the fact...

49:56.720 --> 50:00.656
that my life was supposed to be
difficult, that's what's expected...

50:00.858 --> 50:02.689
then I might not get so pissed off.

50:02.893 --> 50:05.692
And I'd just be glad
when something nice happens.

50:05.929 --> 50:07.396
That's why I'm still in school.

50:07.597 --> 50:10.088
It's easier to have
something to fight against.

50:10.300 --> 50:14.031
Well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

50:14.471 --> 50:17.599
You know, I can be doing
the most nothing thing.

50:17.808 --> 50:20.140
Throwing some darts
or shooting some pool.

50:20.343 --> 50:23.176
Then all of a sudden,
I feel it come over me.

50:23.379 --> 50:25.609
I have got to win.

50:25.816 --> 50:29.275
Is that why you tried to get me
off the train? Competitiveness?

50:29.485 --> 50:30.817
What do you mean?

50:32.723 --> 50:33.917
I got a poem.

50:34.291 --> 50:35.848
Oh, all right.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.222
Will you read it to us?

50:42.865 --> 50:44.265
Sure. Okay.

50:48.304 --> 50:50.238
"Daydream delusion

50:50.706 --> 50:52.674
"Limousine eyelash

50:53.609 --> 50:55.907
"Oh, baby, with your pretty face

50:57.214 --> 51:01.150
"Drop a tear in my wine glass
Look at those big eyes

51:01.417 --> 51:03.544
"See what you mean to me

51:03.886 --> 51:06.752
"Sweetcakes and milk shakes

51:07.056 --> 51:09.218
"I am a delusion angel

51:09.859 --> 51:11.952
"I'm a fantasy parade

51:12.460 --> 51:16.396
"I want you to know what I think
Don't want you to guess anymore

51:16.599 --> 51:18.999
"You have no idea where I came from

51:19.367 --> 51:21.268
"We have no idea where we're going

51:21.604 --> 51:23.333
"Lodged in life

51:23.538 --> 51:25.097
"Like branches in the river

51:25.307 --> 51:28.242
"Flowing downstream
Caught in the current

51:28.476 --> 51:29.999
"I carry you

51:30.279 --> 51:31.768
"You'll carry me

51:32.515 --> 51:34.210
"That's how it could be

51:35.417 --> 51:37.078
"Don't you know me?

51:38.053 --> 51:39.883
"Don't you know me by now?"

51:41.122 --> 51:42.316
Great.

51:42.991 --> 51:45.221
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

51:48.831 --> 51:50.058
Here you go.

51:51.867 --> 51:53.562
- Thanks.
- All right.

51:53.768 --> 51:55.963
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

51:56.172 --> 51:57.322
Good luck.

52:13.355 --> 52:15.049
It was wonderful, no?

52:19.727 --> 52:22.389
- What?
- He probably didn't just write that.

52:22.596 --> 52:25.259
He wrote it, but he
probably plugs that word in.

52:25.466 --> 52:27.729
You know, whatever, "milk shake."

52:27.936 --> 52:29.528
What do you mean?

52:29.736 --> 52:31.932
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

52:39.680 --> 52:42.205
You know what drives me crazy?
People talking about...

52:42.416 --> 52:45.112
how great technology is,
how it saves all this time.

52:45.319 --> 52:48.312
But what good is saved time
if nobody uses it?

52:48.522 --> 52:50.854
If it just turns into more busy work.

52:51.058 --> 52:55.496
I never hear anybody say, "With the time
I've saved using my word processor...

52:55.696 --> 52:58.597
I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

52:58.966 --> 53:01.957
- You don't hear that.
- Time is so abstract anyway.

53:02.202 --> 53:04.796
- Are you looking at this girl?
- What?

53:05.004 --> 53:06.370
Nothing.

53:07.007 --> 53:08.440
You wanna go in here?

53:08.642 --> 53:12.100
- You wanna go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

53:14.213 --> 53:15.203
Wanna go?

53:15.415 --> 53:16.565
Hello.

53:18.384 --> 53:20.215
Fifty schillings.

53:20.420 --> 53:23.320
- Each.
- I got 100. Here, I got it.

53:24.157 --> 53:26.318
I'll buy you a beer. Thank you.

54:14.307 --> 54:16.536
- You gonna buy me a beer?
- Yeah.

54:20.445 --> 54:23.142
You think Old Milwaukee
is expensive here?

54:51.043 --> 54:54.842
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

54:55.046 --> 54:59.414
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

54:59.617 --> 55:02.414
- No, not right now.
- But you did.

55:03.822 --> 55:05.516
We broke up six months ago.

55:05.724 --> 55:08.215
Six months ago? Oh, I'm sorry.

55:08.426 --> 55:11.155
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
Tell me about it.

55:11.362 --> 55:15.129
No way. I can't.
It's really, really boring.

55:15.332 --> 55:17.301
Come on. Tell me about it.

55:19.570 --> 55:21.333
I was really disappointed.

55:21.539 --> 55:24.565
I thought this one would last
for a while. He was...

55:25.010 --> 55:28.844
very stupid, ugly,
bad in bed, alcoholic...

55:29.748 --> 55:32.341
- You know.
- A real prize winner.

55:33.484 --> 55:35.385
I was kind of giving him a favor.

55:35.586 --> 55:38.350
But he left me,
saying I loved him too much.

55:38.555 --> 55:43.288
I was blocking his artistic expression
or some shit like that.

55:44.028 --> 55:46.622
But anyway, I was traumatized
and became...

55:47.231 --> 55:49.461
And became totally obsessed with him.

55:49.967 --> 55:53.094
So I went to a shrink, and it came up
that I had written...

55:53.303 --> 55:57.763
this stupid story about this
woman trying to kill her boyfriend...

55:58.808 --> 56:00.105
and how she'd do it.

56:00.310 --> 56:03.643
It's all the details
of how to do it and not get caught...

56:03.847 --> 56:05.838
She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

56:07.851 --> 56:12.082
Yeah, she was. It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

56:12.288 --> 56:13.551
No, I understand.

56:13.757 --> 56:16.590
This stupid shrink believed
everything I told her.

56:16.793 --> 56:20.490
It was my first time seeing her.
She said she had to call the police.

56:20.696 --> 56:22.597
She had to call the police?

56:24.300 --> 56:27.098
She was totally convinced
I was really gonna do it.

56:27.303 --> 56:30.239
Even though I had explained
it was just some writing.

56:30.440 --> 56:33.375
She said, looking into my eyes,
"The way you said it...

56:33.576 --> 56:35.442
I know you are going to do it."

56:35.645 --> 56:38.205
She was totally out of her mind.

56:39.015 --> 56:41.575
It was my first and last session.

56:41.784 --> 56:43.547
So what happened then?

56:45.456 --> 56:47.514
I totally got over him.

56:47.957 --> 56:49.288
But now, I'm obsessed...

56:49.491 --> 56:53.986
that he's gonna die from
an accident or 1000 kilometers away.

56:54.329 --> 56:56.525
And I'm gonna be the one accused.

56:59.001 --> 57:01.765
Why is it you become obsessed
with people you don't...

57:01.970 --> 57:03.699
really like that much?

57:03.906 --> 57:05.271
I don't know.

57:07.709 --> 57:08.859
So how about you?

57:10.646 --> 57:12.876
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

57:14.783 --> 57:18.549
It's funny how we managed to avoid
this subject for so long.

57:18.753 --> 57:20.516
But now you have to tell me.

57:20.722 --> 57:22.917
Well, I kind of see love...

57:23.125 --> 57:27.357
as this escape for two people
who don't know how to be alone.

57:29.164 --> 57:31.632
It's funny.
People always talk about how...

57:31.834 --> 57:34.631
love is this totally unselfish,
giving thing.

57:34.837 --> 57:38.101
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

57:38.940 --> 57:40.201
I know.

57:41.042 --> 57:42.976
So who just broke up with you?

57:44.912 --> 57:46.074
What?

57:48.382 --> 57:50.681
You sound like you just were hurt.

57:50.886 --> 57:52.182
Do I?

57:52.454 --> 57:53.716
All right.

57:54.890 --> 57:56.323
Big confession.

57:57.058 --> 57:59.652
I should've told you this
earlier or something.

58:00.662 --> 58:03.129
I didn't come to Europe just to...

58:03.330 --> 58:06.528
hang out and read Hemingway in Paris
and shit like that.

58:07.268 --> 58:10.568
I saved up my money all spring to
fly to Madrid...

58:10.771 --> 58:13.331
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend...

58:13.542 --> 58:15.271
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend...

58:15.476 --> 58:18.809
who has been on this art history
program for the last year.

58:19.013 --> 58:22.414
Anyway, I got here.
We were reunited at long last...

58:22.617 --> 58:26.746
and we went out to dinner our
first night with six of her friends.

58:26.953 --> 58:29.582
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo...

58:29.790 --> 58:31.951
Maria, Suzy from home.

58:32.158 --> 58:35.525
She managed to avoid being alone
with me for the first few days...

58:35.729 --> 58:40.358
and I stuck around just to let it
sink in that she wished I hadn't come.

58:42.136 --> 58:45.901
So I bought the cheapest flight out,
this one leaving out of Vienna.

58:46.106 --> 58:49.598
It didn't leave for a couple weeks,
so I bought this Eurail pass.

58:50.277 --> 58:54.407
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

58:56.316 --> 58:59.115
It's when you remember
how little you thought about...

58:59.319 --> 59:02.050
the people you broke up with,
and you realize...

59:02.255 --> 59:05.885
that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

59:06.092 --> 59:08.391
You'd like to think
you're both in pain...

59:08.596 --> 59:11.587
but really, they're just,
"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."

59:11.798 --> 59:14.232
Believe me, I know.

59:14.467 --> 59:16.458
You should look at bright colors.

59:18.171 --> 59:20.037
That's what the shrink told me.

59:20.240 --> 59:22.834
I was paying her 900 francs an hour...

59:23.043 --> 59:25.341
to hear that I
was a homicidal maniac...

59:25.545 --> 59:29.607
but I could shift my obsession if I
would concentrate on bright colors.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.078
Did it work?

59:34.621 --> 59:36.679
- Didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no.

59:37.290 --> 59:41.090
Yeah, well, you know,
I haven't killed anyone lately.

59:41.293 --> 59:42.625
Not lately?

59:42.929 --> 59:44.828
That's good.
You're cured then.

59:51.270 --> 59:54.502
There's breeds of monkeys,
and all they do is have sex...

59:54.840 --> 59:56.274
all the time.

59:56.475 --> 59:58.705
And they turn out to be
the least violent...

59:58.911 --> 01:00:01.879
the most peaceful, the most happy.

01:00:02.081 --> 01:00:04.571
So maybe fooling around's
not so bad.

01:00:04.783 --> 01:00:07.912
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I am.

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.485
- I thought so.
- Why?

01:00:09.688 --> 01:00:13.386
I never heard this one.
But it reminds me of this perfect...

01:00:13.592 --> 01:00:16.027
male argument to justify them
fooling around.

01:00:16.228 --> 01:00:19.664
Women monkeys are fooling around too.
Everybody's fooling around.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:25.061
That's cute. I have this awful,
paranoid thought...

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:28.467
that feminism was mostly invented
by men so they could...

01:00:28.674 --> 01:00:29.971
fool around more.

01:00:30.175 --> 01:00:33.337
"Woman, free your mind,
free your body. Sleep with me.

01:00:33.544 --> 01:00:38.072
We're all happy and free, as long as
I can fuck as much as I can."

01:00:38.884 --> 01:00:39.815
All right.

01:00:40.018 --> 01:00:43.317
But maybe there's some
biological things at work here.

01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:45.046
If you had an island...

01:00:45.257 --> 01:00:49.887
and there were 99 women
on the island and only one man...

01:00:50.094 --> 01:00:52.893
in a year, you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

01:00:53.097 --> 01:00:56.396
But if you have an island
with 99 men and only one woman...

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.264
in a year, you have the possibility
of only one baby. So...

01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:02.539
You know what?

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.904
On this island, I think there
will be only, like, maybe 43 men left.

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:11.013
They would've killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

01:01:11.214 --> 01:01:15.447
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies...

01:01:15.653 --> 01:01:17.314
and no more man.

01:01:17.522 --> 01:01:20.082
Because they would've all
eaten him alive.

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.691
Oh, yeah?

01:01:21.892 --> 01:01:23.621
There's something to that.

01:01:23.828 --> 01:01:27.992
On some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:32.067
I was walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend...

01:01:32.269 --> 01:01:36.763
and we'd just walked by these four
thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

01:01:36.974 --> 01:01:40.137
And one of them says,
"Hey, baby. Nice ass!"

01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:44.007
So I'm like, "No big deal.
I won't get uptight about this."

01:01:44.215 --> 01:01:45.773
Plus, there were four of them.

01:01:45.983 --> 01:01:48.952
Exactly. But she says,
"Fuck you, dickheads!"

01:01:49.152 --> 01:01:52.350
And I'm like, "Okay.
Wait a minute, here."

01:01:52.556 --> 01:01:55.116
They're not gonna come over
and kick her ass.

01:01:55.326 --> 01:01:58.260
So who just got pushed
to the frontline on that one?

01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:01.430
Women say they hate it
if you're all protective.

01:02:01.631 --> 01:02:06.000
But if it suits them, then
they'll tell you you're being unmanly.

01:02:06.202 --> 01:02:10.332
You know what? I don't think
woman really wants to destroy man.

01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:13.607
Even if they want to,
they don't succeed.

01:02:13.810 --> 01:02:16.005
I'm sure even men are
destroying women...

01:02:16.212 --> 01:02:19.272
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women...

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:21.780
Anyway, it's depressing.
You know what?

01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:24.579
- You wanna stop talking about this?
- I hate it.

01:02:24.788 --> 01:02:26.347
Men, women, it's...

01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:29.046
There's no end to it.

01:02:29.592 --> 01:02:31.081
It's like a skipping record.

01:02:31.293 --> 01:02:34.491
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:36.790
And nobody came up with anything.

01:02:53.449 --> 01:02:55.884
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:57.551
A birth dance?

01:03:26.014 --> 01:03:27.675
Should I give her some money?

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:31.184
Everything that's interesting
costs a little money.

01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:34.712
So a birth dance, huh?

01:03:34.923 --> 01:03:37.653
Looked a little bit
like a mating dance to me.

01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:40.658
No, but really.
Women used it when giving birth.

01:03:40.862 --> 01:03:43.263
In part of the world,
they still do it.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.967
The woman in labor enters a tent...

01:03:47.168 --> 01:03:49.761
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance.

01:03:49.971 --> 01:03:52.269
They encourage her
to dance with them...

01:03:52.474 --> 01:03:54.772
so as to make
the birth less painful.

01:03:54.976 --> 01:03:58.412
And when the baby is born,
they all dance in celebration.

01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.811
I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:06.548
I like the idea of dancing as something
everybody participates in.

01:04:06.755 --> 01:04:09.883
I know. I heard about this old guy...

01:04:10.091 --> 01:04:12.217
who was watching
some young people dance.

01:04:12.426 --> 01:04:13.824
He said, "How beautiful.

01:04:14.027 --> 01:04:16.963
They're shaking off their genitals
to become angels."

01:04:17.164 --> 01:04:18.062
I like that.

01:04:18.266 --> 01:04:19.459
One question, though.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:23.329
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff...

01:04:23.538 --> 01:04:24.688
where are the men?

01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:29.138
Are we out food gathering? Are we not
invited? You all don't need us?

01:04:29.342 --> 01:04:31.641
Men are lucky we don't
bite off their heads after mating.

01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:34.815
Certain insects do that,
like spiders and stuff?

01:04:35.015 --> 01:04:37.415
We let you live.
What are you complaining about?

01:04:37.618 --> 01:04:41.246
See, you're officially kidding.
But there's something to that.

01:04:41.454 --> 01:04:43.581
You keep bringing stuff like that up.

01:04:44.224 --> 01:04:47.626
No, no. Wait a minute.
Talking seriously here.

01:04:47.827 --> 01:04:50.729
I mean, I always feel
this pressure of being...

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:53.559
a strong and independent
icon of womanhood...

01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:55.792
and not making it look like...

01:04:56.002 --> 01:04:59.095
my whole life is revolving
around some guy.

01:05:00.673 --> 01:05:02.005
But loving someone...

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:05.644
and being loved
means so much to me.

01:05:06.313 --> 01:05:08.645
I always make fun of it and stuff...

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:11.674
but isn't everything
we do in life...

01:05:11.884 --> 01:05:14.752
a way to be loved a little more?

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:20.422
I don't know.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.794
Sometimes I dream...

01:05:22.996 --> 01:05:26.022
about being a good father
and a good husband.

01:05:26.232 --> 01:05:28.699
And sometimes it feels really close.

01:05:29.368 --> 01:05:31.268
But then other times...

01:05:32.339 --> 01:05:34.363
it seems silly...

01:05:34.574 --> 01:05:36.040
like it would...

01:05:36.408 --> 01:05:38.205
ruin my whole life.

01:05:38.878 --> 01:05:42.040
And it's not just
a fear of commitment...

01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:45.375
or that I'm incapable
of caring or loving because...

01:05:45.585 --> 01:05:46.812
I can.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.849
It's just that, if I'm
totally honest with myself...

01:05:52.124 --> 01:05:53.786
I think I'd rather die knowing...

01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.518
that I was
really good at something.

01:05:56.729 --> 01:05:59.561
That I had excelled
in some way...

01:05:59.798 --> 01:06:01.699
than that I'd just been in...

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.198
a nice, caring relationship.

01:06:11.409 --> 01:06:14.811
I had worked for this older man,
and once he told me...

01:06:15.014 --> 01:06:18.677
that he had spent all of his life
thinking about his career.

01:06:18.885 --> 01:06:21.182
He was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.050
that he had never really
given anything of himself.

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.825
His life was for no one and nothing.

01:06:29.128 --> 01:06:31.459
He was almost crying saying that.

01:06:34.465 --> 01:06:36.934
I believe if there's
any kind of God...

01:06:37.135 --> 01:06:39.126
it wouldn't be in any of us...

01:06:39.437 --> 01:06:41.337
not you or me...

01:06:42.107 --> 01:06:45.234
but just this little space
in between.

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:50.272
If there's any kind of magic
in this world...

01:06:50.481 --> 01:06:54.884
it must be in the attempt of
understanding someone sharing something.

01:06:57.155 --> 01:07:00.454
I know, it's almost
impossible to succeed...

01:07:01.292 --> 01:07:03.021
but who cares really?

01:07:04.128 --> 01:07:06.562
The answer must be in the attempt.

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:18.796
I think this is a civilization in
decline. Look at the service.

01:08:19.002 --> 01:08:22.437
Where is the waitress?
In New York, she'd be out of a job.

01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.707
I'm gonna call my friend in Paris...

01:08:33.883 --> 01:08:37.011
who I'm supposed to have
lunch with in eight hours.

01:08:45.227 --> 01:08:46.455
Pick up.

01:08:46.662 --> 01:08:48.595
- Pick up the phone.
- All right.

01:09:01.644 --> 01:09:05.546
I've been working on my English.
You wanna talk in English, for laughs?

01:09:05.981 --> 01:09:08.380
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.

01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:13.609
I don't think I'll be able to
make it for lunch today.

01:09:15.256 --> 01:09:19.022
I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:21.251
Are you crazy?

01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:23.696
Probably.

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:27.191
- He's Austrian? He's from there?
- No, No.

01:09:27.402 --> 01:09:31.099
He's passing through. He's American.
He's going back home tomorrow.

01:09:31.305 --> 01:09:32.671
Why'd you get off?

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.309
Well, he convinced me.

01:09:37.245 --> 01:09:41.011
I mean, actually, I was ready to
get off the train with him...

01:09:41.216 --> 01:09:43.184
after talking to him a short while.

01:09:43.384 --> 01:09:45.408
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

01:09:46.821 --> 01:09:49.254
In the lounge car,
he began to talk about...

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:52.550
him as a boy seeing
his great-grandmother's ghost.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:56.158
I think that's when I fell for him.

01:09:57.265 --> 01:10:01.100
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.196
He trapped me.

01:10:07.408 --> 01:10:09.102
And he's so cute.

01:10:09.309 --> 01:10:11.470
He has beautiful blue eyes...

01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:13.669
nice pink lips...

01:10:14.514 --> 01:10:16.106
greasy hair.

01:10:16.817 --> 01:10:18.408
I love it.

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.618
He's kind of tall,
and he's a little clumsy.

01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:25.724
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:33.524
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

01:10:33.734 --> 01:10:37.294
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed. It was so adorable.

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:41.331
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

01:10:43.176 --> 01:10:44.803
I'm afraid he's scared of me.

01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:48.970
I told him the story about
the woman that kills her ex-boyfriend.

01:10:49.482 --> 01:10:50.950
He must be scared to death.

01:10:51.151 --> 01:10:54.416
He must be thinking I'm
this manipulative, mean woman.

01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:59.181
I just hope he doesn't feel
that way about me.

01:10:59.392 --> 01:11:02.362
Because, you know me,
I'm the most harmless person.

01:11:03.864 --> 01:11:06.764
The only person I could
really hurt is myself.

01:11:07.668 --> 01:11:09.567
I don't think he's scared of you.

01:11:09.769 --> 01:11:11.601
I think he's crazy about you.

01:11:12.238 --> 01:11:14.331
- Really?
- I've known you a long time.

01:11:14.541 --> 01:11:17.009
I got a good feeling.
You gonna see him again?

01:11:19.779 --> 01:11:22.213
We haven't talked about that yet.

01:11:26.886 --> 01:11:29.583
Okay, it's your turn.
You call your friend.

01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:31.689
All right, all right.

01:11:35.093 --> 01:11:37.619
I usually get this guy's
answering machine.

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:41.960
Hi, dude. What's up?

01:11:43.902 --> 01:11:46.735
Hey, Frank. How you been?
I'm glad you're home.

01:11:46.939 --> 01:11:48.371
Cool. Yeah.

01:11:48.574 --> 01:11:50.131
So how was Madrid?

01:11:50.809 --> 01:11:52.902
Madrid sucked.

01:11:53.579 --> 01:11:56.241
Lisa and I had our
long overdue meltdown.

01:11:56.781 --> 01:11:58.682
Too bad. I told you, no?

01:11:58.884 --> 01:12:02.046
Yeah, yeah. The long-distance thing
just never works.

01:12:02.254 --> 01:12:04.278
I was only in Madrid
for a couple days.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:07.151
I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna.

01:12:09.161 --> 01:12:12.391
You know, it really wasn't
that much cheaper. I just...

01:12:12.598 --> 01:12:16.829
I couldn't go home right away.
I didn't want to see anybody I knew.

01:12:17.034 --> 01:12:19.800
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

01:12:21.473 --> 01:12:22.804
So are you okay now?

01:12:23.008 --> 01:12:26.034
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
That's the thing.

01:12:26.644 --> 01:12:27.794
I'm rapturous.

01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:29.803
And I'll tell you why.

01:12:30.015 --> 01:12:32.916
I met somebody
on my last night in Europe.

01:12:33.118 --> 01:12:35.815
- That's incredible.
- I know, I know.

01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:39.387
You know how they say we're all
each other's demons and angels?

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:43.791
Well, she was literally
a Botticelli angel...

01:12:44.595 --> 01:12:46.621
telling me everything
would be okay.

01:12:49.634 --> 01:12:50.794
How did you meet?

01:12:52.403 --> 01:12:53.871
On the train.

01:12:54.339 --> 01:12:57.501
She was sitting next to
a weird couple that was fighting...

01:12:57.708 --> 01:13:00.871
so she moved. She sat
right across the aisle from me.

01:13:01.078 --> 01:13:03.012
So we started to talk.

01:13:03.214 --> 01:13:05.409
She didn't like me much at first.

01:13:05.616 --> 01:13:06.777
She's super smart...

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:09.682
very passionate...

01:13:10.254 --> 01:13:11.448
and beautiful.

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.480
And I was so unsure of myself.

01:13:15.793 --> 01:13:18.523
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:23.423
Oh, man. I wouldn't worry about that.

01:13:24.034 --> 01:13:26.297
No, I'm sure she was not judging you.

01:13:26.804 --> 01:13:29.102
No, and by the way,
she sat next to you.

01:13:29.306 --> 01:13:31.034
I'm sure she did it on purpose.

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:32.572
Oh, yeah?

01:13:36.346 --> 01:13:40.146
Us men are so stupid. We don't
understand anything about women.

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:43.909
They act strange,
the little I know of them.

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:45.818
Don't they?

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:56.764
I feel like this is
some dream world we're in.

01:13:56.967 --> 01:13:58.558
Yeah, it's so weird.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:01.164
It's like our time together
is just ours.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.201
It's our own creation.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.966
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:11.143
And what's so cool
is that this whole evening...

01:14:11.347 --> 01:14:14.839
all our time together,
shouldn't officially be happening.

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:18.509
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:24.218
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.393
I know.

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:30.327
But now, you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper...

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.125
and see if it fits.

01:14:35.271 --> 01:14:36.636
It'll fit.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:56.853
<i>This friend of mine had a kid...</i>

01:14:57.058 --> 01:15:00.289
and it was a home birth,
so he was there helping out.

01:15:00.495 --> 01:15:03.293
But he said at that
profound moment of birth...

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:08.532
he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time...

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.671
trying to take its first breath.

01:15:10.872 --> 01:15:14.399
All he could think about was
that he was looking at something...

01:15:14.609 --> 01:15:16.635
that was gonna die someday.

01:15:16.978 --> 01:15:19.071
He couldn't get it out of his head.

01:15:19.814 --> 01:15:23.409
And I think that's so true.
Everything is so finite.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:26.449
But don't you think that's what...

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:29.987
makes our time and specific moments
so important?

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.056
Yeah, I know.

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.586
It's the same for us tonight, though.

01:15:36.564 --> 01:15:40.228
After tomorrow, we'll probably
never see each other again, right?

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.365
You don't think we'll
ever see each other?

01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.303
What do you think?

01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:56.172
Actually, I don't know.

01:15:57.251 --> 01:15:58.479
I hadn't planned another...

01:15:58.686 --> 01:16:02.247
Me too. I live in Paris,
you live in the U.S. I understand.

01:16:02.456 --> 01:16:05.221
I'd hate to make you fly.
You'd hate to fly, right?

01:16:05.593 --> 01:16:07.653
I'm not so scared of flying.

01:16:08.529 --> 01:16:09.752
I mean, I could.

01:16:09.763 --> 01:16:11.458
Well, if you were gonna...

01:16:11.732 --> 01:16:13.256
come to the U.S...

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:14.899
or if, you know, if I...

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:17.536
I mean, I could come back here.

01:16:18.605 --> 01:16:19.766
What?

01:16:20.608 --> 01:16:23.838
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

01:16:26.779 --> 01:16:28.474
We should try something different.

01:16:28.682 --> 01:16:31.912
It's not so bad if tonight
is our only night, right?

01:16:33.219 --> 01:16:35.120
People exchange numbers, addresses.

01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:38.155
They end up writing once,
calling each other twice.

01:16:38.358 --> 01:16:40.121
Right. Fizzles out.

01:16:40.427 --> 01:16:42.918
Yeah, I don't want that.
I hate that.

01:16:43.929 --> 01:16:45.523
I hate that too.

01:16:46.132 --> 01:16:49.432
Why does everybody think
relationships should last forever?

01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:51.762
Yeah, why? It's stupid.

01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:56.167
But you think tonight's it?

01:16:56.442 --> 01:16:59.934
I mean, that tonight's our only night?

01:17:01.948 --> 01:17:04.007
It's the only way, no?

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.451
Well, all right.

01:17:09.989 --> 01:17:11.250
Let's do it.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:13.923
No delusions, no projections.

01:17:15.327 --> 01:17:17.319
We'll just make tonight great.

01:17:20.032 --> 01:17:21.227
Let's do that.

01:17:38.718 --> 01:17:40.948
We should do some kind of handshake.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:42.683
Give me your hand.

01:17:46.158 --> 01:17:49.094
To our one and only...

01:17:49.928 --> 01:17:51.418
night together...

01:17:52.164 --> 01:17:54.724
and the hours that remain.

01:18:03.342 --> 01:18:04.492
What?

01:18:07.179 --> 01:18:08.476
It's just...

01:18:08.847 --> 01:18:10.644
It's depressing, no?

01:18:11.649 --> 01:18:14.414
Now, the only thing
we're gonna think of is...

01:18:14.618 --> 01:18:16.552
when we'll have to say goodbye.

01:18:17.355 --> 01:18:20.348
We could say goodbye now.
Then we won't worry about it.

01:18:20.759 --> 01:18:21.909
Now?

01:18:22.694 --> 01:18:23.853
Say goodbye.

01:18:24.062 --> 01:18:25.552
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:28.099
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:30.063
- Later.
- Later, yeah.

01:19:00.398 --> 01:19:01.548
Here's the plan.

01:19:01.665 --> 01:19:04.963
You're gonna grab the glasses,
and I'm gonna get the wine.

01:19:05.469 --> 01:19:07.163
- Red wine.
- Red wine. Right.

01:19:07.371 --> 01:19:10.498
- You think you can do that?
- No problem.

01:19:15.311 --> 01:19:17.576
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

01:19:19.517 --> 01:19:20.667
Hello.

01:19:25.155 --> 01:19:26.452
Do you speak English?

01:19:26.657 --> 01:19:28.715
- A bit.
- Yeah? A bit?

01:19:28.926 --> 01:19:31.554
I'm having kind of an odd situation...

01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:33.558
which is that...

01:19:33.897 --> 01:19:35.832
You see that girl over there?

01:19:40.236 --> 01:19:42.705
Well, this is our only night together...

01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:44.897
and she...

01:19:46.976 --> 01:19:50.275
The problem is that she wants
a bottle of red wine...

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.640
and I don't have any money.

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.519
But I was thinking
that you might want to...

01:19:58.555 --> 01:20:02.115
give me the address of this bar,
and I would promise...

01:20:02.524 --> 01:20:05.961
to send you the money, and you'd
be making our night complete.

01:20:06.162 --> 01:20:08.095
You would send me the money?

01:20:14.203 --> 01:20:15.465
Your hand?

01:20:31.654 --> 01:20:34.019
For the greatest night in your life.

01:20:34.223 --> 01:20:35.919
Thank you very much.

01:20:59.615 --> 01:21:03.210
So often I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments...

01:21:03.418 --> 01:21:07.478
like traveling or staying up
all night and watching the sunrise.

01:21:08.356 --> 01:21:10.916
And I knew those were special moments.

01:21:11.526 --> 01:21:13.757
But something was always wrong.

01:21:14.896 --> 01:21:17.127
I wished I'd been with someone else.

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.062
I knew that what I was feeling...

01:21:21.269 --> 01:21:25.331
exactly what was so important to me,
they didn't understand.

01:21:30.011 --> 01:21:32.002
But I'm happy to be with you.

01:21:34.749 --> 01:21:37.216
You couldn't know
why a night like this...

01:21:37.419 --> 01:21:39.909
is so important
to my life right now...

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.520
but it is.

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:46.592
This is a great morning.

01:21:47.161 --> 01:21:48.924
It is a great morning.

01:21:51.233 --> 01:21:53.530
Do you think we have others like this?

01:21:56.503 --> 01:21:59.632
What about our rational, adult decision?

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.501
Oh, yeah.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:09.111
I know what you mean about wishing
somebody wasn't there.

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.085
It's just, usually, it's myself...

01:22:12.286 --> 01:22:14.446
that I wish I could get away from.

01:22:15.089 --> 01:22:16.989
Seriously, think about this.

01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:19.720
I have never been anywhere...

01:22:19.927 --> 01:22:21.621
that I haven't been.

01:22:22.162 --> 01:22:24.494
I've never had a kiss...

01:22:24.698 --> 01:22:26.723
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:28.798
You know, I've never...

01:22:29.003 --> 01:22:32.233
gone to the movies when
I wasn't there in the audience.

01:22:32.439 --> 01:22:35.034
I've never been out bowling
if I wasn't there...

01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:36.799
making some stupid joke.

01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:39.910
That's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

01:22:40.113 --> 01:22:42.240
It's just, they are sick to death...

01:22:42.448 --> 01:22:44.713
of being around themselves.

01:22:45.485 --> 01:22:49.182
Let's say that you and I
were together all the time.

01:22:49.389 --> 01:22:51.619
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms.

01:22:52.225 --> 01:22:53.556
The way...

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.991
the way every time
that we would have people over...

01:22:57.597 --> 01:23:00.828
I'd be insecure, and I'd get
a little too drunk.

01:23:01.635 --> 01:23:05.400
Or the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story...

01:23:05.605 --> 01:23:07.367
again and again.

01:23:09.108 --> 01:23:11.269
You see, I've heard
all those stories...

01:23:11.544 --> 01:23:14.172
so of course I'm sick of myself.

01:23:18.318 --> 01:23:19.808
But being with you...

01:23:22.054 --> 01:23:24.716
it's made me feel like
I was somebody else.

01:23:26.325 --> 01:23:30.421
I mean, the only other way
to lose yourself like that is...

01:23:31.296 --> 01:23:33.527
you know, dancing...

01:23:33.899 --> 01:23:35.833
or alcohol...

01:23:36.468 --> 01:23:39.334
or drugs, or stuff like that.

01:23:41.873 --> 01:23:43.135
Fucking.

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:47.538
Fucking, yeah. That's one way.

01:24:01.893 --> 01:24:03.656
Do you know what I want?

01:24:04.863 --> 01:24:06.160
What?

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.092
To be kissed.

01:24:14.405 --> 01:24:16.033
Well, I could do that.

01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:31.171
Wait.

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.325
I have to say something stupid.

01:24:38.963 --> 01:24:40.113
All right.

01:24:41.466 --> 01:24:43.093
It's very stupid.

01:24:46.236 --> 01:24:48.397
I don't think we should
sleep together.

01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:55.202
I want to, but since we're never
going to see each other again...

01:24:55.413 --> 01:24:57.312
it'll make me feel bad.

01:24:58.215 --> 01:25:00.945
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

01:25:06.357 --> 01:25:08.824
I know. It's not very adult.

01:25:09.025 --> 01:25:11.893
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:14.260
Let's see each other again.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.993
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

01:25:21.538 --> 01:25:25.474
I don't want to just get laid.
I want to... I mean...

01:25:25.942 --> 01:25:28.103
I mean, I think we should.

01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:31.372
We die in the morning, right?

01:25:32.782 --> 01:25:35.717
- I think we should.
- Then it's like some male fantasy.

01:25:35.919 --> 01:25:39.116
Meet a French girl,
fuck her and never see her again.

01:25:39.322 --> 01:25:42.917
And have this great story to tell.
I don't want...

01:25:43.126 --> 01:25:45.856
this great evening to
just have been for that.

01:25:46.696 --> 01:25:50.223
Okay, we don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:03.078
You don't want to see me again?

01:26:04.513 --> 01:26:05.775
No, of course I do.

01:26:05.981 --> 01:26:08.575
If somebody gave me
the choice right now...

01:26:08.784 --> 01:26:11.686
of to never see you again
or to marry you...

01:26:11.921 --> 01:26:13.071
I would marry you.

01:26:13.222 --> 01:26:15.383
Maybe that's a lot
of romantic bullshit...

01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:18.320
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

01:26:21.764 --> 01:26:22.914
Actually...

01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:29.334
I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

01:26:32.975 --> 01:26:35.876
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

01:26:46.722 --> 01:26:49.053
Why do we make everything
so complicated?

01:26:49.258 --> 01:26:50.748
I don't know.

01:27:52.552 --> 01:27:56.283
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get back to Paris?

01:27:56.757 --> 01:27:58.315
Call my parents.

01:27:58.558 --> 01:27:59.923
What about you?

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:04.390
I don't know. I'll probably go
pick up my dog. He's with a friend.

01:28:04.598 --> 01:28:06.031
You have a dog?
I love dogs.

01:28:06.233 --> 01:28:07.859
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:28:08.201 --> 01:28:10.101
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:28:11.139 --> 01:28:13.698
I don't know.
We're back in real time.

01:28:14.107 --> 01:28:15.801
I know. I hate that.

01:28:16.142 --> 01:28:17.440
What is that?

01:28:19.512 --> 01:28:21.538
Sounds like a harpsichord.

01:28:22.014 --> 01:28:23.642
Check that out.

01:28:24.017 --> 01:28:25.814
Somebody's playing.

01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:33.741
That's cool.

01:28:52.211 --> 01:28:54.476
Can we dance to the harpsichord?

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.045
Of course.

01:28:59.986 --> 01:29:01.136
Oh, wow.

01:29:05.324 --> 01:29:06.985
I'm gonna take your picture...

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:10.251
so I never forget you...

01:29:12.565 --> 01:29:13.827
or all this.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.227
Okay, me too.

01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:18.083
"The years shall run like rabbits."

01:30:20.633 --> 01:30:21.783
What?

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:25.165
Nothing.

01:30:27.072 --> 01:30:28.833
I have...

01:30:29.339 --> 01:30:31.500
this recording of Dylan Thomas...

01:30:31.776 --> 01:30:33.767
reading a W.H. Auden poem.

01:30:33.977 --> 01:30:36.639
He's got a great voice.

01:30:38.583 --> 01:30:39.777
It's like...

01:30:41.119 --> 01:30:43.314
"All the clocks in the city

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.319
Began to whirr and chime:

01:30:46.556 --> 01:30:49.047
"O let not Time deceive you

01:30:49.259 --> 01:30:51.853
"You cannot conquer Time.

01:30:52.196 --> 01:30:54.289
"In headaches and in worry

01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:57.532
"Vaguely life leaks away

01:30:57.733 --> 01:30:59.963
"And Time will have his fancy

01:31:00.170 --> 01:31:02.763
"Tomorrow or today."

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:04.966
Something like that.

01:31:05.942 --> 01:31:07.136
That's good.

01:31:14.751 --> 01:31:18.619
When you talked earlier
about after a few years...

01:31:18.821 --> 01:31:21.450
how a couple would begin
to hate each other...

01:31:21.658 --> 01:31:23.626
by anticipating their reactions...

01:31:23.826 --> 01:31:25.852
or getting tired
of their mannerisms.

01:31:26.596 --> 01:31:28.962
I think it would be
the opposite for me.

01:31:30.133 --> 01:31:34.468
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone.

01:31:35.706 --> 01:31:37.367
The way he's gonna part his hair...

01:31:37.574 --> 01:31:39.700
which shirt he's gonna
wear that day...

01:31:39.909 --> 01:31:44.141
knowing the exact story he'd tell
in a given situation.

01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:48.372
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

01:32:10.039 --> 01:32:12.371
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:14.709
We didn't go to those guys' play.

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:16.139
Play?

01:32:16.344 --> 01:32:17.676
The cow?

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.609
Oh, yeah, we didn't.

01:32:19.814 --> 01:32:22.045
Oh, no. We missed it.

01:32:47.741 --> 01:32:49.734
You know what bus to take
to the airport?

01:32:49.944 --> 01:32:50.843
No problem.

01:32:51.047 --> 01:32:54.447
- I should get on this one.
- Right here. You wanna get on there?

01:32:58.253 --> 01:33:00.186
I guess this is it, no?

01:33:01.855 --> 01:33:03.345
I really...

01:33:08.729 --> 01:33:11.061
- You know...
- Yeah, I know. Me too.

01:33:17.705 --> 01:33:21.196
Have a great life. Have fun
with everything you're gonna do.

01:33:21.408 --> 01:33:23.774
Good luck with school and all that.

01:33:25.179 --> 01:33:26.704
I hate this.

01:33:27.381 --> 01:33:29.906
Me too.
The train is about to leave.

01:33:37.726 --> 01:33:40.421
You know all this bullshit
we're talking about...

01:33:40.627 --> 01:33:43.187
not seeing each other?
I don't want that.

01:33:43.397 --> 01:33:44.591
I don't either.

01:33:44.798 --> 01:33:46.356
- You don't?
- I waited for you to say it.

01:33:46.567 --> 01:33:48.125
Why didn't you say something?

01:33:48.334 --> 01:33:50.496
I was afraid
you didn't wanna see me.

01:33:50.704 --> 01:33:51.966
What do you wanna do?

01:33:53.107 --> 01:33:56.075
Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

01:33:56.276 --> 01:33:58.472
Five years? That's a long time.

01:33:58.679 --> 01:34:02.114
It's awful. It's like
a sociological experiment.

01:34:02.349 --> 01:34:04.340
- How about one year?
- One year.

01:34:05.252 --> 01:34:07.345
- How about six months?
- Six months?

01:34:08.222 --> 01:34:09.985
It's gonna be freezing.

01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:12.851
Who cares? We come here,
we go somewhere else.

01:34:16.029 --> 01:34:17.963
Six months from now or last night?

01:34:19.432 --> 01:34:23.095
Last night. Six months
from last night, which was...

01:34:23.369 --> 01:34:24.632
June 16th.

01:34:24.837 --> 01:34:29.366
So track nine, six months from now
at 6:00 at night.

01:34:29.574 --> 01:34:30.724
December.

01:34:31.277 --> 01:34:34.645
It's a train ride for you,
but I gotta fly all the way here.

01:34:34.847 --> 01:34:36.314
But I'm gonna be here.

01:34:36.516 --> 01:34:38.814
- Okay, me too.
- All right.

01:34:40.553 --> 01:34:42.111
We won't call, write or...

01:34:42.322 --> 01:34:43.754
No, it's depressing.

01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.823
Your train's gonna leave.

01:34:49.028 --> 01:34:50.655
Say goodbye.

01:34:51.364 --> 01:34:52.514
Bye.

01:34:53.533 --> 01:34:54.726
Goodbye.

01:34:55.867 --> 01:34:57.061
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:34:58.538 --> 01:34:59.697
Later.
