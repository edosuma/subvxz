I did travel a lot with my mom though.

19:05.732 --> 19:08.401
We lived, uh, out of a car off and on.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.403
- Really?
- Yeah,

19:10.528 --> 19:12.405
she'd enroll me into school,
and then three months later,

19:12.530 --> 19:15.241
you know, we'd be on the road again.

19:15.366 --> 19:17.827
All the other kids had the same friends,

19:17.952 --> 19:19.829
parents all had jobs,

19:19.954 --> 19:22.289
they went home to the
same house every night.

19:22.415 --> 19:25.585
- You must have missed that.
- Hell no.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.587
I loved running around with my mom.

19:29.714 --> 19:32.926
- Where's your mom now?
- She's, uh...

19:35.261 --> 19:36.429
She's in trouble.

19:37.931 --> 19:39.807
I gotta get back to work.

19:39.933 --> 19:42.393
I'll call you when your parts
are ready. See you later.

19:47.732 --> 19:51.569
[melancholy classical music playing]

20:20.180 --> 20:23.142
Desk of Roman Godfrey. Mr.
Godfrey is behind closed doors.

20:23.225 --> 20:26.186
- [elevator dings]
- May I take a message?

20:26.312 --> 20:28.898
Yes, no, the Cotillion Handicap

20:29.023 --> 20:31.275
is in his calendar. Uh-huh. Yep, um...

20:31.400 --> 20:34.654
Excuse me, ma'am. Sorry, Mr.
Godfrey is behind closed doors.

20:34.779 --> 20:37.907
Out of my way, you twitchy little
maggot, or I'll have you cremated.

20:38.032 --> 20:39.784
Immediately.

20:53.255 --> 20:55.508
I'm sorry to surprise
you like this, darling.

20:57.677 --> 20:58.928
[intercom beeps]

20:59.012 --> 21:01.889
Whatever dumbfuck told you I
am a patient man is a dumbfuck.

21:02.015 --> 21:05.601
- I know you are a busy man.
- [door opens]

21:07.103 --> 21:10.106
I'm so proud of you, continuing
the entrepreneurial spirit

21:10.230 --> 21:13.317
- of the Godfrey name.
- Why is this liver cooked?

21:14.694 --> 21:16.403
Never mind, I'll eat it anyway.

21:22.576 --> 21:25.621
You need to let Pryce do his
work. It's important to us.

21:25.705 --> 21:29.876
- What is his work, exactly?
- Better to show you than try to explain.

21:30.168 --> 21:33.171
- Then show me.
- I'm not sure if you're ready.

21:33.462 --> 21:35.339
Always a game with you.

21:35.464 --> 21:37.800
Lies, secrets, veiled threats.

21:37.967 --> 21:41.054
What is it you and your lackey have
been up to all these years, exactly?

21:43.681 --> 21:45.016
Johann's work...

21:46.767 --> 21:48.394
Well,

21:48.519 --> 21:50.688
I'm alive because of it.

21:50.813 --> 21:54.400
I knew there was a reason why
I hated everything about him.

21:55.651 --> 21:58.278
Is that filling you up?
Or are you still hungry?

22:00.990 --> 22:03.868
You are hungry, aren't you?

22:03.993 --> 22:06.162
Right now you think it's
something you can control,

22:06.245 --> 22:08.164
that you're like normal people.

22:09.289 --> 22:12.585
You, Roman, are anything but normal.

22:12.710 --> 22:15.337
That's why you went to Hawaii,
right? To get away from it?

22:16.380 --> 22:20.093
But the thirst came right along
with you. There's no running from it.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.179
You've probably convinced yourself by now
you're actually doing the world a favor:

22:23.303 --> 22:27.016
going after the dregs of humanity,
people no one will miss...

22:27.100 --> 22:31.062
or that you can feed without killing,
bask in the flush of your own willpower.

22:31.145 --> 22:34.314
Your hunger will only grow deeper.

22:34.440 --> 22:38.485
Bodies will pile up and
eventually lead back to you.

22:38.611 --> 22:40.487
Been on the run for centuries
because we couldn't hide

22:40.613 --> 22:43.281
the victims of our appetite.

22:43.407 --> 22:45.868
Until now.

22:45.993 --> 22:48.746
Until I married us into the White Tower.

22:48.871 --> 22:50.748
At least you admit you've
fucked and finagled your way

22:50.873 --> 22:52.499
through the centuries.

22:54.292 --> 22:56.963
I did it all for you, Roman.

22:57.088 --> 22:59.132
You're my flesh and blood.

22:59.257 --> 23:01.134
What about Shelley?

23:01.259 --> 23:03.803
Have you even thought of her
once since she disappeared?

23:03.928 --> 23:06.555
You think I haven't grieved?

23:06.680 --> 23:08.557
What about my family?

23:08.682 --> 23:10.601
You wanted me to kill my own daughter.

23:12.686 --> 23:14.563
I knew you'd never do it.

23:14.688 --> 23:16.565
It was the only way for you to progress.

23:16.690 --> 23:19.277
I don't want to progress.
I want to be human.

23:19.359 --> 23:22.446
That was never an option.
I am Upir, I am your mother.

23:22.571 --> 23:24.615
I would give anything...

23:24.740 --> 23:26.617
anything...

23:27.367 --> 23:29.745
not to be your son.

23:48.597 --> 23:51.475
You will become more bloodthirsty
with each passing day.

23:54.103 --> 23:56.272
Before you fuck things up for all of us,

23:56.354 --> 23:58.232
come to me.

24:03.696 --> 24:06.699
[tableware clattering]

24:24.643 --> 24:25.564
[speaking Russian]

24:25.565 --> 24:30.810
_

24:30.811 --> 24:32.933
_

24:45.529 --> 24:49.325
[grunting, squishing]

24:54.038 --> 24:55.831
Mrs. Godfrey.

24:55.956 --> 25:00.211
Excuse the sudden visit. I came
by to check out the inventory.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.257
[moaning]

25:05.799 --> 25:07.676
Dr. Pryce has authorized this?

25:07.801 --> 25:09.345
We've been trading calls.

25:09.469 --> 25:12.223
I cannot here allow you
without his permission.

25:12.348 --> 25:14.308
Oh, right. You're new.

25:14.432 --> 25:17.186
Uh, you may not know I own this lab.

25:17.311 --> 25:19.980
You used to... is my understanding.

25:20.064 --> 25:21.439
[door opens]

25:21.523 --> 25:25.278
Dr. Pryce. Mrs. Godfrey is here.

25:25.403 --> 25:27.363
Johann, I spoke to Roman.

25:27.487 --> 25:29.907
Were you able to get
him to listen to reason?

25:30.032 --> 25:32.326
Um...

25:32.450 --> 25:34.536
Why don't we discuss it over a snack?

25:34.661 --> 25:37.123
There's an intake on seven.

25:37.248 --> 25:40.000
Organ donor.

26:02.773 --> 26:05.651
[Marie] Keeping a stash
of hooch in the office...

26:05.776 --> 26:08.821
Isn't that one of the 20 warning
signs you might have a problem?

26:08.946 --> 26:11.324
Before ingesting, consult your physician.

26:13.451 --> 26:15.577
So, basically, I look in the mirror

26:15.702 --> 26:18.331
and self-medicate.

26:20.958 --> 26:22.418
Cheers.

26:24.544 --> 26:26.005
Cheers.

26:30.426 --> 26:32.303
[Marie] Your message was cryptic.

26:33.595 --> 26:35.555
[Norman] I understand you're suing Godfrey.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.434
I was going to tell you.

26:38.558 --> 26:40.769
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into?

26:42.896 --> 26:45.774
You of all people know what
happened to Letha wasn't right.

26:45.899 --> 26:47.818
You were there.

26:47.943 --> 26:50.196
I don't know that anyone

26:50.321 --> 26:53.115
could have done anything
different to change the outcome.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.953
They're withholding records.
Pryce fucked up and they know it.

26:58.078 --> 27:00.914
Look, I'm no fan of that
narcissistic little prick,

27:01.040 --> 27:03.583
but he's protected by the company
and they will come back hard.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.961
The lawyers, they'll tie it up for years.

27:06.086 --> 27:07.963
Because they're hiding something.

27:08.088 --> 27:11.342
Because that's what lawyers are paid to do.

27:11.467 --> 27:14.387
- Why are you opposed to this?
- They will put Letha on trial.

27:14.512 --> 27:16.389
They will say hateful,
awful things about her

27:16.514 --> 27:20.934
to save a few bucks
because that is how it works.

27:21.060 --> 27:23.896
Are you sure you're not
protecting Godfrey Industries?

27:24.021 --> 27:26.440
I've got no skin in this
game. I sold my shares,

27:26.564 --> 27:28.859
I'm out. You know that.

27:28.984 --> 27:31.737
I'm concerned for your well-being.

27:31.862 --> 27:34.156
Bullshit.

27:34.281 --> 27:35.824
Marie...

27:36.950 --> 27:40.413
I never told you
how sorry I am.

27:40.538 --> 27:43.249
I know you're a peacenik, Norman.

27:43.374 --> 27:45.792
And I know you wanna move on.

27:45.918 --> 27:47.794
But I need answers.

27:58.638 --> 28:00.933
Yeah. So do I.

28:12.694 --> 28:15.155
You've got to be kidding me.

28:15.281 --> 28:17.157
Why? You know this guy?

28:19.826 --> 28:22.455
OK, well, I really appreciate, um...

28:22.580 --> 28:24.457
Are you sleeping here?

28:24.582 --> 28:27.167
I'm not sure where I'm sleeping.

28:27.293 --> 28:29.169
Because, I mean, I would
have to ask my cousin,

28:29.295 --> 28:31.171
but if you need a place to stay...

28:31.297 --> 28:35.050
Thanks, that's sweet,
but, um, I'll figure it out.

28:35.175 --> 28:38.929
I just want to make
sure that you're... good.

28:39.054 --> 28:40.931
I'm better than I was.

28:41.056 --> 28:46.604
Talking to you made things
significantly less shitty, so... Thanks.

28:47.646 --> 28:49.523
Yeah, anytime.

28:52.526 --> 28:54.403
- Miranda...
- Yeah?

28:56.196 --> 28:58.574
Just watch yourself, okay?

28:58.698 --> 29:01.368
What's he gonna do? Eat me?

29:22.055 --> 29:25.017
[rumbling sound]

29:40.032 --> 29:42.368
[gunshot]

29:44.703 --> 29:46.997
[Miranda] Well, are you sure?

29:47.122 --> 29:49.333
Could you run it again?

29:49.458 --> 29:52.794
Yes, yes. Nine-zero-one-zero.

29:52.919 --> 29:56.590
Miranda Cates. C-A-T-E-S.

29:56.715 --> 29:58.717
Ugh, well, can you...

29:58.842 --> 30:00.719
<i>can I try another one?</i>

30:00.844 --> 30:03.263
Here, uh...

30:03.389 --> 30:05.432
This is MasterCard. Um,

30:05.558 --> 30:08.644
six-zero-one-four-five...

30:08.768 --> 30:11.564
[classical music playing]

30:24.410 --> 30:27.120
[baby crying]

30:37.256 --> 30:39.841
You should hold her.

30:39.966 --> 30:41.843
Make her stop.

30:41.968 --> 30:43.845
She's been crying all day.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.223
Maybe she's hungry.

30:46.348 --> 30:48.559
- She won't take the formula.
- Try a different one.

30:48.684 --> 30:50.769
I've tried them all.

30:53.021 --> 30:56.275
Where is she getting the
energy to cry this much?

30:56.400 --> 30:59.403
I used to ask the same thing about you.

30:59.528 --> 31:01.405
Never happy.

31:01.530 --> 31:03.532
Your entire family.

31:03.657 --> 31:05.618
Maybe it's some kind of curse.

31:07.578 --> 31:09.996
And why each of you seems to end up alone.

31:11.164 --> 31:15.043
That... was... amazing.

31:15.168 --> 31:17.671
The treatments are more
potent when they're fresh.

31:17.796 --> 31:19.757
I feel alive again.

31:19.881 --> 31:21.759
- Thank God.
- I need to ask...

31:21.883 --> 31:23.969
How did things go with Roman?

31:24.094 --> 31:26.680
- Beautifully.
- You told him, then?

31:26.805 --> 31:28.682
Mm! Everything.

31:28.807 --> 31:31.143
How my health used to depend on
bringing transients to the Mill.

31:31.268 --> 31:33.604
How you protected us,
Johann, disposing of them,

31:33.729 --> 31:37.441
recycling them, so we no longer
have to be afraid. He got it.

31:37.566 --> 31:40.319
Threw his arms around me.

31:40.444 --> 31:42.988
I hope the treatment didn't
induce dissociative euphoria.

31:43.113 --> 31:46.032
I'm telling you, Johann. I
feel like I have a son again.

31:46.158 --> 31:47.660
That's good.

31:47.785 --> 31:49.495
That's excellent.

31:53.957 --> 31:56.502
Oh, hi! I, uh...

31:56.627 --> 31:58.504
just booked a room at a hotel,

31:58.629 --> 32:00.798
and, um, cab's on its way.

32:00.922 --> 32:03.592
So, it's all good.

32:03.717 --> 32:06.011
I can't thank you enough
for letting me stay here

32:06.136 --> 32:08.054
while this all gets sorted out. Um...

32:08.180 --> 32:09.973
I'll come get the rest of my stuff

32:10.098 --> 32:11.891
when my car's ready, if that's okay?

32:11.975 --> 32:15.061
- Sure.
- And, um, I'll look you up

32:15.187 --> 32:17.189
if I ever become a rich and famous author

32:17.314 --> 32:19.650
and start collecting art.

32:21.485 --> 32:24.363
- Miranda...
- Yeah?

32:24.488 --> 32:26.365
Don't lie to me.

32:27.783 --> 32:28.992
You have nowhere to go.

32:29.117 --> 32:33.163
- Yes, I do.
- Where?

32:33.288 --> 32:35.207
- That's none of your business.
- All you have to do is ask.

32:35.332 --> 32:38.126
- What?
- Just ask if you can stay.

32:38.251 --> 32:41.421
You're being a weirdo.

32:41.547 --> 32:43.923
I'm sorry.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.677
I'm not good with... hospitality.

32:48.595 --> 32:51.097
If you don't have a place to
go, please be my guest tonight?

32:51.223 --> 32:55.268
I'd love you to join me for dinner.

33:01.191 --> 33:03.068
You want to know what
your dream means, right?

33:03.193 --> 33:05.070
So we're going to the source of all things.

33:05.195 --> 33:07.072
The human race is deeply fucked

33:07.155 --> 33:09.324
if "the source of all
things" is in your bathroom.

33:09.408 --> 33:10.950
One of the images from your dream,

33:11.076 --> 33:13.328
the snake in a rushing torrent of
water... gives us a place to start.

33:13.453 --> 33:15.330
In a bathtub?

33:15.455 --> 33:17.541
All water is connected.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.544
- Spit, please.
- Seriously?

33:20.669 --> 33:23.129
This is your consciousness
we're exploring here... spit.

33:26.383 --> 33:28.218
Thank you.

33:33.223 --> 33:34.850
Ah! No! No!

33:36.935 --> 33:37.936
Relax. We're cousins.

33:39.062 --> 33:40.814
What is it?

33:40.939 --> 33:43.650
A psychoactive smoothie I whipped up.

33:43.776 --> 33:46.236
To stimulate my root chakra.

33:47.487 --> 33:49.155
Stepping away...

34:25.108 --> 34:28.821
[moaning softly]

34:31.572 --> 34:33.742
[moaning]

34:33.867 --> 34:35.494
What's happening?

34:35.619 --> 34:38.914
[moaning]

34:40.039 --> 34:42.458
Oversharing there, coz.

34:45.629 --> 34:47.088
Destiny?

34:50.091 --> 34:53.512
[moaning]

34:59.142 --> 35:01.854
[screaming]

35:03.981 --> 35:05.148
Shit!

35:08.777 --> 35:11.154
[retching]

35:22.666 --> 35:24.125
Come on.

35:25.878 --> 35:27.337
Come on.

35:28.129 --> 35:30.007
Come on! No!

35:45.230 --> 35:47.774
[coughing]

35:47.900 --> 35:50.318
Hey... Hey.

35:50.443 --> 35:52.863
You okay?

36:09.755 --> 36:11.798
Did you figure something out with your car?

36:11.924 --> 36:13.926
I figured out this whole

36:14.051 --> 36:17.178
trip to California thing
is a complete disaster.

36:17.303 --> 36:19.556
Like "The Curse of the Fu Manchu".

36:19.681 --> 36:22.517
But at least the guy from the
body shop is helping me out.

36:22.642 --> 36:24.686
Helping you how?

36:24.811 --> 36:26.813
He's looking for used parts
to help knock down the bill.

36:26.939 --> 36:30.316
Otherwise I'd be stranded
forever in Hemlock "Groove".

36:30.442 --> 36:32.485
Or take a bus back to Bangor.

36:34.613 --> 36:37.323
Why'd you leave?

36:37.449 --> 36:39.325
A breakup.

36:39.451 --> 36:41.453
I didn't want to do winter alone.

36:45.248 --> 36:47.125
How old are you?

36:47.250 --> 36:49.586
Eighteen.

36:49.711 --> 36:52.965
Eighteen and already Lord of the Manor?

36:55.300 --> 36:58.553
My father passed, my mother is sick,

36:58.678 --> 37:00.597
and my sister disappeared.

37:00.722 --> 37:02.682
So everything's been left to me.

37:02.808 --> 37:07.312
Wait, your sister... is that the
Godfrey girl they're looking for?

37:07.479 --> 37:08.688
Yeah.

37:08.772 --> 37:10.732
Someone in town said...

37:10.857 --> 37:12.484
Don't believe everything you hear.

37:19.992 --> 37:21.952
My dad passed, too.

37:22.077 --> 37:23.787
A couple of months ago.

37:23.912 --> 37:28.583
He got IED'd in Afghanistan.

37:31.962 --> 37:34.172
My dad stuck a gun in
his mouth when I was four.

37:36.299 --> 37:38.176
I found him.

37:38.301 --> 37:40.303
Brains all over the floor.

37:42.472 --> 37:44.850
Jeez...

37:44.975 --> 37:46.267
[door closes]

37:46.392 --> 37:47.853
What was that?

37:47.978 --> 37:51.982
Servants. As befits
the "Lord of the Manor".

37:52.107 --> 37:53.984
[chuckling]

37:56.111 --> 37:58.279
You wanna see something brilliant?

37:58.404 --> 38:00.281
Hey, Beautiful Dreemer.

38:00.406 --> 38:02.283
Do you ride?

38:02.408 --> 38:05.286
- Dirt bikes.
- Really?

38:05.411 --> 38:08.414
When my family was stationed
in Germany, I'd, um,

38:08.540 --> 38:11.250
sneak off-base, find a Vespa to hotwire,

38:11.376 --> 38:13.837
blast around for a couple hours.

38:13.962 --> 38:16.381
- Ever get caught?
- Nope.

38:16.506 --> 38:19.885
My little secret. Everybody's got 'em.

38:20.010 --> 38:22.470
I'm an open book.

38:22.595 --> 38:25.849
Au contraire... You're
a full-on Byronic Hero.

38:25.974 --> 38:28.143
I have no idea what that means.

38:28.267 --> 38:31.521
A major business tycoon and
you've never heard of Lord Byron?

38:31.646 --> 38:33.940
OK, I admit to a few gaps in
my otherwise extensive knowledge

38:34.066 --> 38:35.608
of pretty much everything...

38:35.734 --> 38:40.363
He was a poet who invented a
whole type of literary character:

38:40.488 --> 38:43.324
arrogant, cunning...

38:43.449 --> 38:46.327
cold on the outside, but on the inside

38:46.452 --> 38:49.956
burning with rage.

39:02.802 --> 39:06.806
I should probably get some sleep.

39:06.932 --> 39:09.267
Of course.

39:09.392 --> 39:12.020
It was wonderful to meet
you, Beautiful Dreemer.

39:38.255 --> 39:40.132
[Norman] Hello, Doc.

39:42.259 --> 39:44.385
- Norman.
- I was waiting outside,

39:44.510 --> 39:47.180
but some folks here, the janitor at least,

39:47.305 --> 39:49.224
are still glad to see me.

39:49.348 --> 39:51.101
What can I do for you?

39:51.226 --> 39:54.395
Well, we need to talk about Letha's death.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.397
Not much to talk about.

39:56.522 --> 39:58.733
She died of a pulmonary embolism.

39:58.858 --> 40:01.694
I wanna see the medical report.

40:01.820 --> 40:04.948
We sent them to your wife. Ex-wife.

40:05.073 --> 40:07.617
You sent her the admissions
sheet and the death certificate.

40:07.742 --> 40:12.455
If Letha had an embolism, you'd
have run an EKG, a D-dimer test...

40:12.580 --> 40:15.750
And a pulmonary angiogram,
yes. But she was gone

40:15.875 --> 40:19.087
before we could do any of
that. Surely you remember...

40:19.212 --> 40:22.632
My daughter was brought here to die.

40:23.758 --> 40:26.385
Look, this is an emotional topic.

40:26.511 --> 40:29.181
Why did you cremate the
bodies before doing an autopsy?

40:29.306 --> 40:30.765
You authorized it. You signed the papers...

40:30.890 --> 40:33.059
I was out of my mind with grief.

40:33.185 --> 40:35.061
I'm sure I would sign anything
you stuck in front of me,

40:35.187 --> 40:40.358
but as the doctor in charge,
it was your responsibility to, well...

40:40.483 --> 40:44.612
unless of course there was
something you needed to cover up.

40:50.076 --> 40:53.330
I am sorry about Letha.

40:53.454 --> 40:56.457
Her complications were rare and tragic.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.835
But they happen.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.920
Hm.

41:10.138 --> 41:13.141
Oh, Marie and I, we're
filing a wrongful death suit.

41:13.266 --> 41:16.186
Thanks to my stock sale, I can
match you lawyer for lawyer.

41:16.311 --> 41:19.272
So get ready for a subpoena shit storm.

41:19.397 --> 41:24.694
You, Mr. Pryce, are gonna have to
account for everything around here.

41:33.078 --> 41:36.873
I just wanted to let you know
that I thought of you today.

41:36.998 --> 41:40.543
I know I haven't... been the best...

41:40.668 --> 41:43.421
Well, whatever. Things
are so different now.

41:43.546 --> 41:46.091
There's so much more time to think.

41:46.216 --> 41:48.676
I told myself a lie today about Roman.

41:48.801 --> 41:52.180
I... I convinced myself he still loves me.

41:52.305 --> 41:54.974
Maybe... maybe it will come
true. Maybe, when he realizes

41:55.141 --> 41:58.270
how alike we are, he'll come back to me.

41:58.395 --> 42:00.688
Mm.

42:00.813 --> 42:03.983
Good night, Norman.

42:06.111 --> 42:08.780
God, I'm such an idiot.

42:43.064 --> 42:45.691
[Destiny] I'm serious, Peter.

42:45.817 --> 42:48.278
You need to forget about these dreams.

42:48.403 --> 42:50.280
How am I supposed to forget about 'em?

42:50.405 --> 42:52.282
Somehow. Drop it.

42:52.407 --> 42:55.410
Just... stay as far away
from this as you can.

42:58.079 --> 43:00.457
You still haven't told me what
the hell happened in there.

43:00.581 --> 43:03.084
I'm not sure.

43:06.296 --> 43:08.506
But I felt some big...

43:08.631 --> 43:11.717
bad... shit

43:11.843 --> 43:14.471
that you do not want to be a part of.

43:25.023 --> 43:27.525
How do you know?

43:27.650 --> 43:30.069
You always say you can't
see into the future.

43:35.450 --> 43:37.952
I experienced it.

43:42.957 --> 43:46.961
Whatever it is, it's out there...

43:48.254 --> 43:51.257
and it's really fucking bad.

44:15.365 --> 44:18.701
Oh my God...

45:01.077 --> 45:02.203
Stop it!

45:02.287 --> 45:04.705
No, Peter! I want you to
promise me to let this go!

45:04.830 --> 45:06.916
- I can't help my dreams, Destiny.
- Ignore it!

45:07.041 --> 45:08.918
- Banish it from your mind!
- [door opens]

45:09.043 --> 45:10.711
Just give me...

45:10.836 --> 45:12.838
I almost died in there.

45:13.005 --> 45:16.968
- [door closes]
- [Andreas] What's up, guys?

45:20.679 --> 45:21.973
Long story.

45:22.098 --> 45:26.478
I'm gonna go take a shower,
get this snake smell off of me.

45:26.603 --> 45:28.605
I'm not done with you.

45:35.278 --> 45:37.572
I had to run an errand in Kirkwood.

45:37.696 --> 45:40.116
They've got this bakery...

45:40.241 --> 45:43.369
best blintzes you've ever
put your mouth around.

45:45.704 --> 45:47.624
Gone Sis?

45:51.461 --> 45:54.088
- You Gypsy dog.
- You know what this is?

45:54.213 --> 45:57.175
The Wagoneer Oasis.

46:00.011 --> 46:02.347
It's a...

46:02.472 --> 46:05.266
trailer park for horny truckers.

46:05.391 --> 46:09.646
Letters on the sign burned out,
so all it says is, "Gone Sis".

46:09.770 --> 46:14.526
The concrete blondes there were
known as the "Gone Sisters".

46:14.651 --> 46:17.028
- Thanks, man.
- Any time.

46:17.153 --> 46:19.113
And tell Destiny...

46:20.490 --> 46:22.367
Never mind.

46:22.492 --> 46:25.995
"Never mind". I'll give her the message.

46:48.142 --> 46:52.480
♪ I pushed her in where ♪
♪ She would drown ♪

46:52.605 --> 46:56.442
♪ Lord, I watched her floatin' down ♪
