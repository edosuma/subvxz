<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:10.237 --> 00:13.005
Sandy's death was no act
of mob violence.

00:13.007 --> 00:14.673
It was premeditated.

00:14.675 --> 00:17.175
The ISI killed him.
Straight out.

00:17.177 --> 00:19.011
<i>Name's Farhad Ghazi.</i>

00:19.013 --> 00:21.013

DENNIS:
<i>I am the husband</i>

00:23.384 --> 00:24.783

00:24.785 --> 00:26.251
- What do you want?
- I've told you already.

00:26.253 --> 00:28.020
A package arrives
at the FBI headquarters

00:28.022 --> 00:29.721
in Washington, DC.

00:29.723 --> 00:32.591
Inside are the documents you
stole from your wife's computer.

00:32.593 --> 00:34.793
You're arrested for treason,
and your wife's career

00:34.795 --> 00:36.028
is destroyed by association.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.396
Once you've done
all I've asked,

00:37.398 --> 00:39.965
you can leave Islamabad.

00:41.135 --> 00:43.368
You did the psych eval, too?

00:43.370 --> 00:45.871
I just have my very last
polygraph, then I'm out.

00:45.873 --> 00:48.740
Well, I guess I'm even more
grateful that you're here now.

00:48.742 --> 00:50.742
Anything for you, Carrie.

00:50.744 --> 00:54.646
Is that the real reason you
didn't come with me to Kabul?

01:02.489 --> 01:04.456
Haissam Haqqani's alive.

01:04.458 --> 01:07.426
Well, it... That's impossible.
He was killed in the air strike.

01:07.428 --> 01:08.894
Apparently not,
because I just saw him

01:08.896 --> 01:10.929
walk out of a madrassa
with Aayan Ibrahim.

01:10.931 --> 01:12.831
He was with Aayan?

01:13.667 --> 01:16.134
So this is where you'll stay.

01:16.136 --> 01:18.070
I thought... I thought
we were going to London.

01:18.072 --> 01:20.839
We are, once I get you
a passport and a visa.

03:52.487 --> 03:54.654
- Looking.
- No.

03:59.995 --> 04:02.629
Yeah. Sorry.

04:03.498 --> 04:05.665
It's okay.

04:13.842 --> 04:15.842
Um...

04:15.844 --> 04:17.844
I...

04:17.846 --> 04:20.680
Sh... Should I leave?

04:20.682 --> 04:21.848
Leave?

04:21.850 --> 04:24.117
No.

04:24.119 --> 04:26.519
No. Let's have breakfast.
I'll get us something.

04:26.521 --> 04:29.389
Uh, I'll go.

04:29.391 --> 04:32.025
It's best you stay out of sight.

04:46.608 --> 04:49.142
You all right?

04:49.144 --> 04:51.378
Yeah.

04:56.718 --> 04:59.052
A bit overwhelming.

05:01.323 --> 05:03.290
Yeah.

05:05.093 --> 05:08.828
You like pastries, coffee?

05:08.830 --> 05:11.097
Sure.

05:11.099 --> 05:13.400

05:31.836 --> 05:32.937
_

05:41.463 --> 05:43.062
Go check out the view.

05:43.064 --> 05:45.098
Yup.

05:59.481 --> 06:00.914
It's good.

06:00.916 --> 06:02.415
That's right
where I saw Haqqani.

06:02.417 --> 06:04.584
Okay.

06:04.586 --> 06:06.185
Make yourself comfortable.

06:06.187 --> 06:08.988
We really expect him
to show his face again?

06:08.990 --> 06:12.325
Doubtful, but we might ID
the cleric you saw him with.

06:14.095 --> 06:16.296
(sighs)

06:19.568 --> 06:21.100
What's that for?

06:21.102 --> 06:22.569
In case Haqqani does show.

06:22.571 --> 06:25.505
I thought
this was just a stakeout.

06:25.507 --> 06:27.340
It is, but things happen.

06:27.342 --> 06:28.741
If that happens,

06:28.743 --> 06:30.410
what's our fallback plan?

06:30.412 --> 06:33.279
Parvez and Qadir
are working that out now.

06:33.281 --> 06:34.814
That sounds vague.

06:35.617 --> 06:37.417
Fara, what's the problem?

06:37.419 --> 06:42.288
Carrie said I just had to sit
in an office, play a journalist.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.424
Then you went the extra mile.

06:44.426 --> 06:47.126
You tailed Aayan,
and you spotted Haqqani.

06:47.128 --> 06:48.561
Yeah.

06:48.563 --> 06:49.862
You're in it now.

06:49.864 --> 06:52.432
Great.

06:52.434 --> 06:55.535
Guess what.
You're good at it.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.412
SAUL: I got to say,
it feels funny

07:06.414 --> 07:08.381
to be leaving
just when things are heating up.

07:08.383 --> 07:09.716
You're the former director,
Saul.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.384
Lockhart needs
to hear it from you.

07:11.386 --> 07:12.952
Keep his mouth shut.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.421
He's taking a lot of heat
for the strike on the wedding.

07:15.423 --> 07:17.957
He would love to deflect that
with news of an ISI conspiracy.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.425
I'll lay it out for him,

07:19.427 --> 07:21.661
but we both know he's
a political animal.

07:21.663 --> 07:23.663
Well, if he can't
control himself,

07:23.665 --> 07:25.999
our operation
on Haqqani's fucked.

07:31.673 --> 07:33.406
Hmm.

07:36.911 --> 07:39.579
So what's the plan to find him?

07:39.581 --> 07:41.314
I'm working on the nephew now.

07:41.316 --> 07:42.849
He's our gateway.

07:42.851 --> 07:44.517
How's that going?

07:44.519 --> 07:46.419
Good. Good.

07:47.756 --> 07:49.756
Think that he's recruitable?

07:49.758 --> 07:52.692
He's young, emotional.

07:53.495 --> 07:55.595
One step at a time.

07:55.597 --> 07:57.697
The first one's the biggest.

07:57.699 --> 08:00.667
Getting him to admit
Haqqani's actually alive.

08:00.669 --> 08:03.603
He'd have to know he was risking
his life by telling you.

08:03.605 --> 08:05.171
Yeah.

08:05.173 --> 08:06.506
How long you have?

08:06.508 --> 08:07.840
Three days.

08:07.842 --> 08:09.208
After that, he starts wondering

08:09.210 --> 08:11.544
why we aren't
on our way to London.

08:11.546 --> 08:13.212
Three days.

08:13.214 --> 08:16.783
To develop that kind of trust?

08:16.785 --> 08:18.384
That's a tall fucking order.

08:18.386 --> 08:20.720
- Well, thanks for pointing that out.
- (chuckles)

08:20.722 --> 08:22.789
Got to jump. Good luck.

08:22.791 --> 08:24.557
I'll call you from DC.

08:24.559 --> 08:27.960
Do that. Safe travels.

08:33.234 --> 08:35.534
(engine starts,
car doors closing)

08:41.976 --> 08:43.943
(door opens)

08:44.746 --> 08:46.412
(door closes)

08:46.414 --> 08:48.548
Aayan, what are you doing?

08:48.550 --> 08:51.451
I'm sorry.
I have changed my mind.

08:52.253 --> 08:54.053
What do you mean?

08:54.055 --> 08:55.521
I have to go.

08:55.523 --> 08:57.056
Go where?

08:57.058 --> 08:59.225
I'll be fine. I'll go
to my friend Kiran's house.

08:59.227 --> 09:01.160
And her father will
throw you out again.

09:01.162 --> 09:02.261
I'll go to school.

09:02.263 --> 09:03.529
You've been expelled.

09:03.531 --> 09:05.031
Look, I'm sorry. I can't stay.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.999
Hey, Aayan, lay of the land.

09:07.001 --> 09:08.835
You're a public figure now.

09:08.837 --> 09:10.036
Not just in Pakistan.

09:10.038 --> 09:11.537
In Europe, in the
United States.

09:11.539 --> 09:14.340
- I've heard all this, so...
- Well, believe it.

09:15.577 --> 09:18.144
That video has made you
a target.

09:19.247 --> 09:20.747
The strike that
killed your family--

09:20.749 --> 09:22.582
- you know who did that, right?
- Yes, CIA.

09:22.584 --> 09:24.250
And you are a living,
breathing reminder

09:24.252 --> 09:25.885
- of that fuckup.
- Why do they care?!

09:25.887 --> 09:28.621
They care,
and they have a kill list.

09:30.391 --> 09:32.892
Yesterday, you told me I should
be worried about the ISI.

09:32.894 --> 09:35.561
Now, today, you're telling me I
should be worried about the CIA.

09:35.563 --> 09:37.130
You should be worried
about both.

09:37.132 --> 09:38.898
- I did not put that video up!
- That doesn't matter!

09:38.900 --> 09:41.634
It's up, and you're in danger,
so don't be stupid.

09:41.636 --> 09:44.537
You walk out that door,
you will be grabbed up,

09:44.539 --> 09:45.905
disappeared.

09:45.907 --> 09:47.807
Do you understand?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.283
You feel bad, right?

09:58.820 --> 10:02.288
About what we did.

10:05.593 --> 10:07.894
It's against my faith.

10:07.896 --> 10:09.262
I know.

10:09.264 --> 10:10.797
I-I don't want to sin.

10:10.799 --> 10:12.999
- I want to be devout.
- It's fine.

10:13.001 --> 10:16.569
We don't have
to do anything, okay?

10:18.406 --> 10:20.406
Okay.

10:20.408 --> 10:22.642
But your situation
is very serious.

10:22.644 --> 10:25.645
You do not leave here
until we go to London.

10:27.615 --> 10:29.816
(sighs)

10:32.754 --> 10:34.453
MARTHA:
I'm not gonna last

10:34.455 --> 10:36.222
an hour in these shoes.

10:38.092 --> 10:40.326
(sighs)

10:40.328 --> 10:43.095
Hey, you booked tonight?

10:43.097 --> 10:46.599
The Sindhi concert.

10:46.601 --> 10:48.467
You're invited.

10:48.469 --> 10:50.036
I've heard enough
Pakistani music to last

10:50.038 --> 10:52.138
a lifetime, if you don't mind.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.940
I figured.

10:53.942 --> 10:55.942
Listen.

10:55.944 --> 10:57.443
Yes.

10:57.445 --> 10:59.579
- I know you're mad.
- That you're leaving?

11:01.282 --> 11:04.817
After giving me 24-hour notice?
Not at all.

11:04.819 --> 11:07.286
But I have some good news.

11:07.288 --> 11:09.055
I changed my mind.

11:09.057 --> 11:11.691
Is that right?

11:11.693 --> 11:16.495
It was a hasty decision,
and it was unfair to you.

11:16.497 --> 11:18.631
I talked to Bill
about maybe next semester.

11:18.633 --> 11:22.401
My, another turn of events.

11:22.403 --> 11:24.170
You're clearly very pleased.

11:24.172 --> 11:25.671
I have a staff meeting.

11:25.673 --> 11:28.641
I just said I'm staying,
so what's the problem now?

11:28.643 --> 11:31.043
Do you really think I believed
you had a job offer?

11:31.045 --> 11:32.245
Excuse me?

11:32.247 --> 11:33.713
I have friends at GW, too.

11:33.715 --> 11:35.348
You don't recover
from plagiarism, Dennis.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.883
- Can we ever get over that?
- So don't make up a story.

11:36.885 --> 11:39.452
If you want to leave,
say it to my face.

11:45.093 --> 11:47.660
I want to stay.

11:51.165 --> 11:53.332
Why?

12:05.380 --> 12:07.947
So how long
have you known Carrie?

12:07.949 --> 12:10.349
Two years, more or less.

12:10.351 --> 12:11.784
Really?

12:11.786 --> 12:13.686
I would have thought
you guys go way back.

12:13.688 --> 12:16.756
Yeah, it feels
that way sometimes.

12:16.758 --> 12:18.858
Hmm. She's just one
of those people.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.793
You connect.

12:20.795 --> 12:22.361
Yeah.

12:22.363 --> 12:25.164
So does that make you
a professional liar, too?

12:27.568 --> 12:30.937
She told me I have to become one
to be good at this job.

12:30.939 --> 12:33.773
Well, you're learning
from the best.

12:33.775 --> 12:35.474
Why'd you say it like that?

12:35.476 --> 12:37.209
Manipulating people,

12:37.211 --> 12:39.445
exploiting their weakness...

12:42.150 --> 12:44.483
It can get ugly sometimes.

12:44.485 --> 12:45.751
Is that the plan with Aayan?

12:45.753 --> 12:48.120
- What?
- Lie, manipulate, exploit.

12:48.122 --> 12:50.990
We're using the enemy's
own weight to bring him down.

12:50.992 --> 12:52.391
That is the job.

12:52.393 --> 12:54.760
Second floor, that's him.

12:54.762 --> 12:56.162
(shutter clicks)

12:56.164 --> 12:57.330
You sure?

12:57.332 --> 12:58.898
Yes. He was with Aayan

12:58.900 --> 13:00.833
and Haqqani.

Flight information's inside.

13:29.364 --> 13:30.830
Has he confirmed his seat?

13:30.832 --> 13:33.766
The embassy travel office
did it this morning.

13:35.169 --> 13:37.837
He was originally scheduled
to leave two days ago

13:37.839 --> 13:40.439

13:40.441 --> 13:41.774

Mathison at the hotel,

13:43.678 --> 13:45.644

a call to General Latif

13:45.646 --> 13:47.847

lunch-- I think.

Yes.

Yeah.

And where is he now?

14:03.731 --> 14:05.464
In the hotel gardens.

14:05.466 --> 14:07.233
Working on his Finnish,
best I can tell.

14:07.235 --> 14:08.734
Finnish?

14:08.736 --> 14:11.404
- Rosetta Stone tapes.
