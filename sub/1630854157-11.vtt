Sorry I'm late.
Had a family emergency

00:36.036 --> 00:39.164
with, um... I don't know.
I want to say Chris?

00:39.164 --> 00:40.874
Uh, I wasn't listening
super close.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.043
Why don't you sit down
and drink beer

00:43.043 --> 00:45.879
and tell us about it instead of
being home with your family?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.964
Apparently, Chris and his
girlfriend broke up.

00:47.964 --> 00:50.175
Something about her wanting
to see other people.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.761
So the doctor says
this surgery is gonna

00:52.761 --> 00:54.220
restore my eyesight.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.972
What? Oh, no.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.223
"Oh, no"?

00:57.223 --> 00:59.851
But I thought you'd be happy,
Colin Farrell.

00:59.851 --> 01:02.228
Oi, blimey. Uh, get stuffed.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.439
I'm-I'm gonna see other birds.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.858
G-Good day, mate.

01:06.858 --> 01:10.737
Don't look. Don't look.
I think that's Colin Farrell.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.073
And this girl
was his first love.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.325
Poor Chris.
He was sobbing his eyes out

01:15.325 --> 01:16.701
when I abruptly left.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.912
First loves always
hit the hardest.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.082
I'll say. I still remember
my first real love.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.583
Seems like yesterday.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.293
Why, just thinking back on her
makes everything

01:25.293 --> 01:27.962
all shimmery and distorted.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.756
<i>I was working
for Federal Express,</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:31.549
<i>like Tom Hanks in</i> Cast Away.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.593
<i>And just like Tom Hanks
in</i> Cast Away,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.595
<i>I said the words
"Federal Express"</i>

01:35.595 --> 01:37.222
<i>a suspicious number of times.</i>

01:37.222 --> 01:40.141
Excuse me, miss. Asking
as a Federal Express employee,

01:40.141 --> 01:43.019
may I please get a refill
of iced tea very quickly,

01:43.019 --> 01:45.313
the way Federal Express
delivers parcels?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.399
<i>There was only one thing
I loved more</i>

01:47.399 --> 01:49.234
<i>than corporate-branded content,</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:51.736
<i>and that was my fiancée,
Helen Hunt.</i>

01:51.736 --> 01:53.029
<i>Hubba-hubba.</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:54.447
<i>Darn right hubba-hubba.</i>

01:54.447 --> 01:56.282
<i>You know how most guys
want their girlfriends</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:57.867
<i>to look like a pissy bird?</i>

01:57.867 --> 01:59.869
<i>Well, I was living the dream.</i>

01:59.869 --> 02:01.496
You're 17 seconds late.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.331
I am a Federal Express employee

02:03.331 --> 02:05.000
who is very obsessed with time.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.876
Well, that's my fiancé.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.462
Give me a kiss, you
time-obsessed beardless man

02:09.462 --> 02:11.965
who is unable to spear
a fish with a sharpened stick.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.591
<i>Remember
all that stuff for later.</i>

02:13.591 --> 02:16.636
Mm, oh, I can't wait
to do more than kiss.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.263
Only three more days
till the wedding.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.724
Yep. I've got just
one last flight

02:20.724 --> 02:23.727
across the Planecrash Sea,
and then I'm all yours.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.228
<i>Little did I know.</i>

02:25.228 --> 02:27.564
<i>I'll never forget
that fateful day.</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:29.607
<i>Looking back,
I never should have</i>

02:29.607 --> 02:31.151
<i>tried to do two fantasy
football drafts</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:32.527
<i>while flying a plane.</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:36.281
<i>-I ended up with four defenses.</i>
- Ugh!

02:36.281 --> 02:37.657
<i>FE-117,</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.200
<i>looks like
you got rough weather.</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:40.785
<i>Maybe you should just
do auto-draft</i>

02:40.785 --> 02:42.495
<i>for your fantasy leagues, over.</i>

02:42.495 --> 02:44.205
Uh, negative, negative, Control.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.124
I am heterosexual, over.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.418
<i>Ha.
There's that clean-shaven guy</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:49.919
<i>who cannot spear a fish
with a stick</i>

02:49.919 --> 02:51.504
<i>that we all know and love.</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:53.673
Damn it.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.925
Too bad I'm in an airplane
and can only go

02:55.925 --> 02:58.636
straight into a storm
and not over or around.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.930
Wait, I think the storm
is breaking up.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.308
<i>I was gonna make it, but then</i>

03:03.308 --> 03:05.602
<i>the plane got hit
by lightning.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:06.686
Oh!

03:06.686 --> 03:08.146
<i>And I somehow drafted the punter</i>

03:08.146 --> 03:09.856
<i>Jeff Feagles
in the second round.</i>

03:09.856 --> 03:11.024
Oh!

03:11.024 --> 03:13.401
<i>And it was all over.</i>

03:17.697 --> 03:20.950
<i>I was all alone
on an uncharted island.</i>

03:20.950 --> 03:22.160
<i>What could I do?</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:23.745
<i>Definitely not spear a fish</i>

03:23.745 --> 03:25.413
<i>with a hand-sharpened stick.</i>

03:25.413 --> 03:27.499
<i>'Cause remember, that was a
complete non-starter for me.</i>

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
<i>If I wanted to make it back
to my Helen,</i>

03:29.668 --> 03:31.753
<i>I'd need to find a way
to survive.</i>

03:31.753 --> 03:34.631
<i>Luckily I had a whole
plane's worth of FedEx parcels</i>

03:34.631 --> 03:36.007
<i>I could open and use.</i>

03:36.007 --> 03:37.926
<i>Oh, please be food.
Please be food.</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.595
Oh, thank God, I'm saved.
Peanut brittle.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.680
Aah!

03:41.680 --> 03:43.556
"From Peter Griffin."

03:43.556 --> 03:46.351
<i>Gotcha. Continue.</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:49.813
<i>But then I opened the most
important package of all.</i>

03:49.813 --> 03:51.523
<i>My only friend on the island.</i>

03:51.523 --> 03:54.818
I'm gonna call you Wilson,
after Rita Wilson,

03:54.818 --> 03:57.445
the most beautiful and talented
woman in Hollywood.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.407
The true first lady
of American culture.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.826
<i>I swear, I didn't say
all that stuff just so Tom Hanks</i>

04:02.826 --> 04:04.119
<i>would let us do this movie.</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:10.291
Character development.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.751
<i>I had been on that island</i>

04:11.751 --> 04:13.044
<i>for four years.</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:14.587
Man, I've been on this island

04:14.587 --> 04:16.798
for somewhere between
two and seven years.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.342
I'm not sure which 'cause I'm
no longer obsessed with time.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.719
<i>That's more character development.</i>

04:20.719 --> 04:22.804
<i>Anyway, all these years later,</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:25.348
<i>I still couldn't get
Helen Hunt out of my mind.</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:27.142
<i>I was going nuts
thinking about her.</i>

04:27.142 --> 04:29.102
Oh, Helen...

04:29.102 --> 04:31.479
Oh come on, get it together.
Think of something else.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.441
Think of anything besides
Helen Hunt.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.317
Oh, almost Helen Hunt.

04:36.317 --> 04:37.944
<i>Enough was enough.</i>

04:37.944 --> 04:40.947
<i>I decided to build a raft
and get back to my beloved.</i>

04:40.947 --> 04:42.615
<i>But what to make
the raft out of?</i>

04:42.615 --> 04:44.451
Got to be something
I can use.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.619
What floats?
What floats?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.164
Mm, definitely not these
footballs for Tom Brady.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.791
Straight to the bottom.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.841
I wonder.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.426
Aah!

05:01.426 --> 05:04.095
<i>Two for two. Continue.</i>

05:04.095 --> 05:05.597
<i>I was able to float away</i>

05:05.597 --> 05:08.308
<i>on a raft made
out of the giant joke box.</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:11.644
<i>It was me and Wilson and
this one other kind of lame guy.</i>

05:11.644 --> 05:13.104
Boy, you hoist a sail,

05:13.104 --> 05:15.482
then where did the wind go?
Am I right?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.192
I just saw you
take a dump in the ocean.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.152
I'm not really
looking to chat.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.905
<i>Days passed.</i>

05:21.905 --> 05:23.698
<i>Wilson and I were all alone.</i>

05:23.698 --> 05:27.744
<i>No drinking water
and no food, except...</i>

05:27.744 --> 05:29.204
Nope, not this time.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.039
<i>Eh, you're no fun. Continue.</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:33.375
<i>But then disaster struck.</i>

05:42.592 --> 05:44.636
Aah! Aah!

05:44.636 --> 05:47.138
No. No! Wilson!

05:48.556 --> 05:50.016
<i>Eventually I moved on</i>

05:50.016 --> 05:52.977
<i>and largely forgot about Wilson.</i>

06:11.663 --> 06:13.123
Why are you smiling, honey?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.291
Oh, I used to bone
that volleyball.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.338
<i>I don't remember much
after that.</i>

06:20.338 --> 06:23.675
<i>Apparently I was picked up
by some cargo ship.</i>

06:23.675 --> 06:25.051
<i>But then,
wouldn't you know it,</i>

06:25.051 --> 06:27.721
<i>the ship got taken over
by Somali pirates.</i>

06:27.721 --> 06:29.889
Look at me.
Look at me.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.392
We are doing this movie now.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.519
<i>Then that Somali pirate
did a bunch of stuff</i>

06:34.519 --> 06:35.979
<i>and then nothing else
ever again,</i>

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
<i>and eventually I got back home.</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:39.816
<i>After years and years away,</i>

06:39.816 --> 06:42.736
<i>it was finally time
to see my Helen.</i>

06:42.736 --> 06:44.612
Oh, my God, you're alive.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.698
I thought about you
every day, Helen.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.034
You're the reason I stayed alive
all these years.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.244
I never stopped loving you.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.413
I'm-I'm sorry.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.498
I got back together
with Paul Reiser.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.624
What?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.876
We did a <i>Mad About You</i> reboot

06:57.876 --> 06:59.252
on Spectrum Originals.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.587
<i>Which just sounds fake.</i>

07:00.587 --> 07:02.005
<i>I mean, did you watch
any of that?</i>

07:02.005 --> 07:03.631
<i>Do you even know anyone who...</i>

07:03.631 --> 07:06.676
<i>I-I... Like, I literally
do not know one person</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:08.595
<i>who saw, like,
a single minute of that.</i>

07:08.595 --> 07:10.013
I'm so sorry.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.515
<i>I was devastated.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:14.893
<i>Helen was my first true love--</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:16.853
<i>the only woman I ever wanted--</i>

07:16.853 --> 07:18.938
<i>and she had moved on
without me.</i>

07:18.938 --> 07:21.316
<i>Fortunately, five years later,
they invented</i>

07:21.316 --> 07:23.276
<i>portable pornography
on telephones,</i>

07:23.276 --> 07:24.986
<i>and I've literally never
thought about her since.</i>

07:32.994 --> 07:36.998
Well, that was a touching tale
of first love, Quagmire.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.626
And I googled Spectrum
Originals, by the way.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.837
Found nothing.
Zero matches.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.839
Nothing on Ask Jeeves either,

07:44.839 --> 07:47.550
but they don't always
have everything.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.803
Anyway, I remember
my first love.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.305
It's quite an interesting story.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.641
Okay, guess
I'll be going last tonight.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.019
This was back
in the early '60s.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.271
<i>I was working
at a hoity-toity camp</i>

08:00.271 --> 08:01.648
<i>for rich Jewish people.</i>

08:01.648 --> 08:02.899
<i>Are you Jewish in this?</i>

08:02.899 --> 08:04.901
<i>No.</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:07.237
<i>- I was a dance instructor.</i>
- ♪ ♪

08:07.237 --> 08:09.072
<i>Anyway, this camp
was highly renowned</i>

08:09.072 --> 08:12.325
<i>for offering exclusively
clean dancing.</i>

08:12.325 --> 08:15.120
You are the cleanest dancer
I ever met.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.955
It's why we come here
every year.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.457
<i>But all the while,
I was being watched</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:22.419
<i>by the prettiest girl
in the camp.</i>

08:22.419 --> 08:26.256
<i>Her name was Jennifer Schnozz,
and I saw her everywhere.</i>

08:26.256 --> 08:29.592
<i>Seems like she was always
sniffing around someplace.</i>

08:29.592 --> 08:31.261
<i>Okay.</i>

08:31.261 --> 08:34.139
<i>Daytimes were reserved
for clean dancing,</i>

08:34.139 --> 08:35.974
<i>but at night,
someone would bring</i>

08:35.974 --> 08:38.560
<i>a very large watermelon
to the staff cabin,</i>

08:38.560 --> 08:39.853
<i>and for some reason,
that meant</i>

08:39.853 --> 08:42.230
<i>it was time for dirty dancing.</i>

08:46.484 --> 08:48.695
<i>We had booze, sexy music,</i>

08:48.695 --> 08:50.822
<i>and because it was August
by a lake,</i>

08:50.822 --> 08:52.407
<i>lots of mosquitos.</i>

08:58.038 --> 09:00.623
<i>My favorite partner
was Dancy McGee.</i>

09:00.623 --> 09:02.917
<i>She was the best dancer
on the staff,</i>

09:02.917 --> 09:05.003
<i>as you can tell
from this dance party</i>

09:05.003 --> 09:07.672
<i>where she's dancing
neither better nor worse</i>

09:07.672 --> 09:10.342
<i>than anyone on the staff.</i>

09:10.342 --> 09:12.969
<i>But there Jennifer was again,</i>

09:12.969 --> 09:15.513
<i>always with her nose
pressed against the glass,</i>

09:15.513 --> 09:18.433
<i>or anything else she was
standing three feet away from.</i>

09:18.433 --> 09:20.727
<i>Might be going a bit hard
with the nose stuff.</i>

09:20.727 --> 09:23.146
<i>Relax, she's fine.
She got a new one.</i>

09:23.146 --> 09:25.231
<i>It was time to make my move.</i>

09:25.231 --> 09:26.733
Hey, do I know you?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.526
Yeah.
We were both in <i>Red Dawn</i>

09:28.526 --> 09:31.738
and we probably had sex on set
and then you dumped me

09:31.738 --> 09:33.365
and now we famously
hate each other.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.241
Oh, yeah, Jennifer.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.661
Well, welcome
to the Poke-a-nose.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.747
<i>That was kind of my joke
around camp.</i>

09:40.747 --> 09:42.123
<i>People loved it,
way better than my</i>

09:42.123 --> 09:44.167
<i>"welcome to the Catskills" bit.</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:47.170
<i>I was not invited back
to that camp.</i>

09:47.170 --> 09:49.422
Joe, come quick!
It's Dancy.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.341
What's the matter?

09:51.341 --> 09:53.259
It's-it's my jaw.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.594
It's very clicky.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.930
I th... I think I have TMJ.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.682
- TMJ?
- Oh, no!

09:58.682 --> 10:00.308
I hear that causes
mild discomfort

10:00.308 --> 10:02.310
but doesn't otherwise
interfere with lifestyle.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.937
<i>Of course, back then,
it was illegal</i>

10:03.937 --> 10:05.355
<i>to get jaw surgery.</i>

10:05.355 --> 10:07.107
<i>The only places
that would do it</i>

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
<i>were sketchy, unsafe,
back-alley jaw clinics.</i>

10:09.943 --> 10:12.487
Do you want to keep
the TMJ?

10:12.487 --> 10:15.865
Come on, Joe.
I'm single, I'm poor,

10:15.865 --> 10:17.742
I work at a Jewish camp
for tips.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.119
<i>Ugh. Brutal.</i>

10:19.119 --> 10:21.496
<i>What's three percent of frugal,
am I right?</i>

10:21.496 --> 10:22.831
<i>Not the year for it, Peter.</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:25.291
But, Dancy, what about
the big talent show?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.003
<i>Dancy was gonna be my partner
at the camp talent show,</i>

10:28.003 --> 10:30.964
<i>which is the most important
thing in this whole story.</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:32.716
After I get my jaw surgery,

10:32.716 --> 10:34.718
I'm gonna be in
mouth recovery, Joe.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.094
I'm out.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.097
What? Then who am I
supposed to dance with?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.932
Literally any one
of these other women

10:40.932 --> 10:43.268
- we just saw dancing?
- I'll do it.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.352
Ugh.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.854
I know I've never
danced before,

10:45.854 --> 10:46.980
but you could teach me.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.857
All right, I'll give you a shot,

10:48.857 --> 10:50.191
but you better not be ticklish

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
if I touch the inside
of your arm

10:52.068 --> 10:53.570
during dance practice.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.448
Y-Yeah. No, no, that-that
won't be a problem.

11:02.078 --> 11:05.790
This is the
I was talking about!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.675
Wow, I guess I'm just
really bad at

11:15.675 --> 11:17.886
you holding me over your head
while I do nothing.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.971
Eh, keep practicing.
You'll get there.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.931
Anyway, I like how you
always seem to drop me

11:21.931 --> 11:24.684
into the one warm spot
in this whole cold lake.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.355
Yeah, and I, uh, I like how
you're at least 18 years old.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.439
Actually, I'm...

11:29.439 --> 11:31.691
I like how you're
at least 18 years old.

11:31.691 --> 11:35.528
<i>Her nickname was "Baby,"
which means over 18 years old.</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:38.573
<i>Anyway, we were falling
in love, but then...</i>

11:38.573 --> 11:41.368
- Joe, come quick! It's Dancy.
- Again?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.119
He's developmentally disabled

11:43.119 --> 11:45.205
and that's the only thing
he knows how to say

11:45.205 --> 11:47.374
but still, we should
go check on her.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.797
It's... it's bad, right?

11:53.797 --> 11:55.048
No, no, it's fine.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.758
Hey, can you hang on a sec?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.932
<i>President Kennedy
said he's excited to show</i>

12:03.932 --> 12:08.311
<i>the city of Dallas, quote,
"just how white a shirt can be."</i>

12:08.311 --> 12:11.272
Joe, this is serious.
My whole jaw's messed up.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.608
I don't understand.
We sent you to the best

12:13.608 --> 12:16.194
cigarette-smoking surgeon
we know.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.363
But listen,
you're gonna be okay.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.990
Son of a bitch!

12:20.990 --> 12:22.951
<i>Fortunately, Jennifer
had called her father,</i>

12:22.951 --> 12:24.202
<i>who's a doctor.</i>

12:24.202 --> 12:26.705
Oh, dear God.
Good thing I got here in time.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.540
Fetch me my big bag
of medical supplies

12:28.540 --> 12:30.125
I take on vacation.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.960
Thank you for coming,
Dr. Hartman.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.004
Shut up. I don't like you
because you're poor.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.296
Daddy, is she gonna be okay?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.966
She's gonna make it.
But I blame you for this.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.551
Because it's important
for the story

12:39.551 --> 12:41.469
- that I blame you for this.
- I'm sorry.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.887
Sorry doesn't cut it.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.765
Something this terrible
calls for real consequences.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.102
No dancing with my daughter
at the meaningless talent show.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.937
What? No!

12:50.937 --> 12:52.814
My word is final.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.195
<i>So what I'm doing right here
is I'm thinking about Jennifer</i>

12:59.195 --> 13:01.031
<i>and how she's like the wind.</i>

13:01.031 --> 13:02.949
<i>What does that mean,
"she's like the wind"?</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:04.784
<i>Just, you know,
she and the wind.</i>

13:04.784 --> 13:07.078
<i>Uh, lots of similarities
there, you know.</i>

13:07.078 --> 13:08.830
<i>She's very wind-like.</i>

13:08.830 --> 13:10.540
<i>Yeah, but like,
but how, specifically?</i>

13:10.540 --> 13:12.167
<i>I mean, where do I even start?</i>

13:12.167 --> 13:14.878
<i>Basically, they're like
two peas in a pod, those two.</i>

13:14.878 --> 13:16.629
<i>Her and the wind.
You know?</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:17.964
<i>No, I don't kn... You know,</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:19.007
<i>you keep saying "you know,"</i>

13:19.007 --> 13:20.425
<i>and I don't know,</i>

13:20.425 --> 13:21.926
<i>and that's why
I'm asking the question.</i>

13:21.926 --> 13:24.596
<i>In what precise way
is she like the wind?</i>

13:24.596 --> 13:28.516
<i>Well, um, like, if you picture
my heart like trees,</i>

13:28.516 --> 13:30.977
<i>she blows through my trees.</i>

13:30.977 --> 13:33.146
<i>All right, so in what way
is your heart like trees?</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:34.939
<i>Aw, look,
it's a good song, okay?!</i>

13:34.939 --> 13:36.441
<i>The point is
I'm missing Jennifer,</i>

13:36.441 --> 13:37.609
<i>I want her back.</i>

13:37.609 --> 13:38.610
<i>Just say that then.</i>

13:38.610 --> 13:40.445
<i>Enough with this wind business.</i>

13:40.445 --> 13:42.364
<i>Finally, it came--</i>

13:42.364 --> 13:44.199
<i>the night of the big
talent show.</i>

13:44.199 --> 13:46.951
<i>The show started late
'cause the grandma bragging</i>

13:46.951 --> 13:48.453
<i>had gone a bit long.</i>

13:48.453 --> 13:51.081
Doctor!

13:51.081 --> 13:52.916
Buzz, buzz, buzz, lawyer.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.628
Five foot, six.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.547
Everyone, I hope you enjoyed
the dinner of leftovers

13:59.547 --> 14:01.216
from last year's dinner.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.385
<i>I mentioned it was
a Jewish camp, right?</i>

14:03.385 --> 14:06.763
But now it's time
to start the talent show.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.307
<i>This was my last chance.</i>

14:09.307 --> 14:10.725
<i>I wasn't gonna
let all those hours</i>

14:10.725 --> 14:13.103
<i>of standing in a lake
go to waste.</i>

14:13.103 --> 14:16.523
Nobody puts Legal Adult
in a corner.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.567
<i>Unfortunately, this was
the Star of David Dining Hall,</i>

14:19.567 --> 14:22.487
<i>so pretty much
the whole place was corners.</i>

14:22.487 --> 14:25.490
<i>It was finally time
for us to dance together.</i>

14:25.490 --> 14:27.701
Happy 1963, everyone.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.245
For our big finale,
we're gonna dance to a song

14:30.245 --> 14:32.247
written in 1985.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.466
<i>She bop, he bop a we bop ♪</i>

14:43.466 --> 14:45.427
<i>I bop, you bop... ♪</i>

14:45.427 --> 14:48.179
<i>We had to dance to this song
about female masturbation</i>

14:48.179 --> 14:50.890
<i>because we couldn't afford
"The Time of My Life."</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.434
<i>I think you mean
open parentheses</i>

14:52.434 --> 14:55.937
<i>"I've Had" closed parentheses,
"The Time of My Life."</i>

14:55.937 --> 14:58.106
<i>Sure, whatever.
The point is we danced great</i>

14:58.106 --> 15:01.359
<i>and everyone
was cheering for us.</i>

15:03.278 --> 15:05.071
Yay!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.365
Joe, come quick!
It's Dancy.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.785
<i>And that's the story
of my first love.</i>

15:10.785 --> 15:13.038
<i>P.S., that night we had sex,
I got her pregnant,</i>

15:13.038 --> 15:15.206
<i>and three weeks later
she had an abortion.</i>

15:15.206 --> 15:17.500
<i>I mean jaw-fixing.
Whatever we called it earlier.</i>

15:23.548 --> 15:26.009
- Well, I remember my first...
- Anyway, I remember my first...

15:26.009 --> 15:28.470
Oh.

15:28.470 --> 15:31.139
Think, uh, think it's probably
gonna be Peter, right?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.515
Sorry, Cleveland.

15:32.515 --> 15:35.602
But I remember my first love.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.356
<i>It was 1989,
the golden age of Hollywood.</i>

15:39.356 --> 15:42.025
<i>The year of</i>
Troop Beverly Hills,

15:42.025 --> 15:44.194
Fletch Lives,
Gleaming the Cube,

15:44.194 --> 15:46.029
<i>and a hilarious new addition</i>

15:46.029 --> 15:48.406
<i>to the</i> Harry and the Hendersons <i>franchise.</i>

15:48.406 --> 15:51.785
Harry meets a girl Bigfoot?
Count me in.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.287
<i>Well, that's what
I thought, anyway.</i>

15:54.287 --> 15:56.539
<i>Turns out Harry
was shorter in this movie,</i>

15:56.539 --> 15:58.124
<i>but he did look marvelous.</i>

15:58.124 --> 16:00.669
<i>And the actress?
Oh, my gosh.</i>

16:02.712 --> 16:04.881
<i>You know how I always wanted
to marry a woman</i>

16:04.881 --> 16:06.966
<i>who looks like
the</i> Full House <i>baby?</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:10.136
<i>Well, this was her: Meg Ryan.</i>

16:10.136 --> 16:11.262
Schwing!

16:11.262 --> 16:12.514
<i>I said, being the first person</i>

16:12.514 --> 16:13.765
<i>who ever said that.</i>

16:13.765 --> 16:14.974
Ha, ha, that guy's
the first person

16:14.974 --> 16:16.476
to ever say that.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.103
Wow, you're hilarious.

16:18.103 --> 16:19.813
What's your name
so we can tell everyone

16:19.813 --> 16:21.231
that you were the first?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.441
Aw, come on, guys, I don't care
who gets the credit.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.318
<i>This is making your story
less credible.</i>

16:25.318 --> 16:28.905
<i>Anyway, from the first time
I saw Meg Ryan pout</i>

16:28.905 --> 16:30.448
<i>in</i> When Harry Met Sally,

16:30.448 --> 16:33.660
<i>I knew I wanted to see her pout
in every movie.</i>

16:33.660 --> 16:35.370
<i>And then eventually
change her face</i>

16:35.370 --> 16:37.038
<i>so she's incapable of pouting.</i>

16:42.585 --> 16:45.922
Ah, nothing better
than movie theater popcorn.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.466
Some for me,
some for the cleaning guy.

16:48.466 --> 16:51.678
Some for me, some for
the cleaning guy.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.097
<i>So, you must really
like this movie.</i>

16:54.097 --> 16:57.600
Are... are-are you...
are you talking to me?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.436
I got to talk to <i>somebody.</i>

16:59.436 --> 17:01.563
He's about to do
a 20-minute song parody

17:01.563 --> 17:03.732
of the 1988 Oscar nominees.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.859
♪ Broadcast News

17:05.859 --> 17:07.652

<i>♪ Here I am,</i> Moonstruck
<i>in the middle with you. ♪</i>

17:11.364 --> 17:14.159
Come join me, Peter.
It's a 1980s movie,

17:14.159 --> 17:16.786
so there's lots and lots
of 1940s music.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.719
- What's that guy doing?
- He's ruining the movie.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.804
Joe, come quick!
It's Dancy.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.268
So that happened.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.395
I've never heard that.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.231
You're the first.
Peter Griffin's the first.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.359
Aw, come on, Meg Ryan,
it's not about that.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.235
<i>Yeah, you got to stop
doing this, Peter.</i>

17:52.322 --> 17:54.324
<i>That day we talked and talked</i>

17:54.324 --> 17:57.410
<i>as an unrealistic amount
of leaves fell around us.</i>

17:57.410 --> 17:59.245
Hey, thanks for
walking me around

17:59.245 --> 18:01.414
in this watered-down
Woody Allen movie.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.125
You're welcome, Peter.
But what do you think?

18:04.125 --> 18:06.419
Can a man and a woman
just be friends

18:06.419 --> 18:07.879
without the sex?

18:07.879 --> 18:11.132
Oh, uh, yeah, uh, sure, yeah.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.842
Uh, me-men and women
can just be friends.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.387
But, like, the fourth
or fifth friend you call.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.056
What do you say, Peter?
Friends?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.433
- Friends with benefi...
- Benefits? No.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.143
I was gonna say Benefiber.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.229
I been getting wicked
stopped up lately.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.774
- Ew.
- Welcome to being friends
with a guy, Meg Ryan.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.072
<i>Me and Meg Ryan
had a special connection.</i>

18:34.072 --> 18:35.865
<i>I even followed her
into other movies,</i>

18:35.865 --> 18:37.158
<i>like</i> Sleepless in Seattle,

18:37.158 --> 18:39.327
<i>which ends on the top
of the Empire State building.</i>

18:39.327 --> 18:41.705
Gee, Pop, I'm sorry
I left my backpack

18:41.705 --> 18:43.915
just laying around
at the Empire State Building,

18:43.915 --> 18:46.876
which is an actual plot point
from the film.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.170
Don't worry,
it's still just the 1990s,

18:49.170 --> 18:50.755
so it's okay to abandon
your backpack

18:50.755 --> 18:52.340
in big-city landmarks.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.051
See something, say nothing,

18:55.051 --> 18:57.512
That's the 1990s
New York way.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.809
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.146
Ah. This is our last chance
to look at Brooklyn

19:06.146 --> 19:08.231
before Lena Dunham gets there.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.442
<i>I also followed her
to</i> You've Got Mail,

19:10.442 --> 19:12.610
<i>where I drove her little
bookstore out of business</i>

19:12.610 --> 19:15.321
<i>before my big bookstore
went out of business.</i>

19:15.321 --> 19:18.658
<i>Also, I DMed her on my
eight-inch-thick laptop.</i>

19:19.743 --> 19:23.413
<i>As always, I wrote to her
as friends. Just friends.</i>

19:23.413 --> 19:26.708
<i>It seemed like we'd be
just friends forever,</i>

19:26.708 --> 19:29.627
<i>but then came the movie
that changed everything.</i>

19:29.627 --> 19:32.505
<i>The most important film
of all time:</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:35.508
In the Cut.
<i>Because naked!</i>

19:35.508 --> 19:38.386
It's just, ever since we met
you've been my best friend,

19:38.386 --> 19:40.430
and I was always afraid
of damaging that

19:40.430 --> 19:42.557
because I don't want to risk
this connection.

19:42.557 --> 19:45.226
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.604
Shut up, Meg.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.814
<i>Excuse me, sir? Sir.</i>

19:49.814 --> 19:51.066
Wake up, sir.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.525
<i>Turns out I never did get pulled</i>

19:52.525 --> 19:54.069
<i>up into that movie screen.</i>

19:54.069 --> 19:55.737
<i>I had just
Pee Wee Herman'ed myself</i>

19:55.737 --> 19:57.572
<i>in the theater and fell asleep.</i>

19:57.572 --> 19:59.366
Huh? What?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.034
What's going on here?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.994
Um...

20:02.994 --> 20:05.163
I'll have what she's having?

20:05.163 --> 20:08.291
And that's when my doctor said,
"You can't drink and do Ambien."

20:08.291 --> 20:11.711
So, there you go,
my first love: Meg Ryan.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.463
Or maybe Melanie Griffith.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.090
You know, now that
I'm thinking about it,

20:15.090 --> 20:16.508
did you see <i>Body Double?</i>

20:16.508 --> 20:17.842
Good God.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.719
That's a wonderful story, Peter.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.388
I'm always happy just to listen

20:21.388 --> 20:24.307
and be here for you.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.942
Donna says hi.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.826
Is it okay if I tell
my first love story?

20:42.826 --> 20:44.244
If it wasn't
good enough to tell

20:44.244 --> 20:46.454
in one of the 88 episodes
of your show,

20:46.454 --> 20:48.081
maybe it's not
good enough for us.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.877
Could you guys
do me a favor and laugh

20:52.877 --> 20:55.005
like I'm telling you
a hilarious story?

20:55.005 --> 20:56.464
See?

20:56.464 --> 20:58.216
I get a flashback, too.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.885
I don't see nothing shimmering.
