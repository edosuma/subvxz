<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.786 --> 00:03.756
I spent most of last night,

00:03.781 --> 00:06.128
getting up to speed on an
arms dealer named Dion Stavros.

00:06.558 --> 00:08.330
Found out exactly where
he's getting his weapons

00:08.331 --> 00:10.332
and to whom
he's selling them.

00:10.383 --> 00:12.635
So, I have 25 missile
launches I need to move.

00:12.686 --> 00:14.206
You've got 24 hours
to find me a buyer.

00:14.271 --> 00:15.671
Where are
my missile launchers?

00:15.722 --> 00:17.606
Hey!

00:17.674 --> 00:19.007
Your count was off.

00:19.059 --> 00:21.977
There are only 20 missile
launchers--not 25.

00:22.028 --> 00:23.562
We might keep secrets
for a living,

00:23.647 --> 00:25.347
but we can't keep them
from each other.

00:25.398 --> 00:28.400
I had a partner.
Her name was Helen Hanson.

00:28.485 --> 00:30.152
We were married
for the mission, but--

00:30.203 --> 00:31.687
You fell in love.

00:31.738 --> 00:33.689
The last couple of days,
I've learned quite a bit

00:33.740 --> 00:35.023
about Auggie's ex,
Helen Hanson.

00:35.075 --> 00:36.659
Ask him if
he's talked to her recently.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.528
- She's dead!
- Is she? Ask him.

00:39.579 --> 00:41.046
I could never
work for you.

00:41.131 --> 00:42.698
I held out my hand

00:42.749 --> 00:43.865
and pulled you
out of the fire,

00:43.917 --> 00:45.084
and this is how
you repay me!

00:45.168 --> 00:48.420
I have Seth Newman's
flash drive,

00:48.505 --> 00:50.272
and I am taking you down.

01:19.202 --> 01:21.453
Hey.

01:21.538 --> 01:23.706
Hey.

01:23.757 --> 01:26.458
You're here.

01:26.543 --> 01:29.578
What are you doing here?
What happened with Rossabi?

01:29.629 --> 01:31.180
Henry.

01:31.247 --> 01:33.015
Henry?
What'd Henry do?

01:33.082 --> 01:34.967
He tanked
the DNA results,

01:35.051 --> 01:37.469
saved me from the Feds.

01:37.554 --> 01:38.804
What?

01:38.888 --> 01:42.641
Then, he offered me a job
at Lexington.

01:42.726 --> 01:44.693
When I turned him down,
he told me to

01:44.761 --> 01:48.030
think about the people
I've aligned myself with.

01:48.097 --> 01:50.482
Those people being me.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.785
That's right.

01:52.869 --> 01:54.987
Did he say
anything else?

01:55.071 --> 01:59.325
He said to ask you if you've
spoken to Helen lately.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.245
Why would he tell you
to ask me that?

02:04.831 --> 02:05.965
I don't know.

02:06.049 --> 02:08.116
What do you think?

02:08.168 --> 02:10.252
Well, I haven't
talked to her.

02:10.303 --> 02:13.305
How could I?
She's dead.

02:13.390 --> 02:16.342
Is there any more
to that story?

02:17.844 --> 02:19.795
Annie.

02:19.846 --> 02:23.799
Everything that I've told you
about Helen is the truth.

02:34.077 --> 02:37.496
So, what do you think
is his angle here?

02:37.580 --> 02:40.315
I don't know.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.117
I mean, if he's trying to
drive a wedge between us,

02:42.168 --> 02:44.920
using my dead wife seems
a clumsy way to do it.

02:44.987 --> 02:47.289
He stood a better chance
using that file.

02:51.878 --> 02:54.213
Do you keep
any old photos?

02:54.297 --> 02:56.348
Uh, yeah, a few.
Why?

02:56.433 --> 02:57.933
Do you have any
of Helen?

03:01.604 --> 03:05.190
The woman in this photo
is Teresa Hamilton,

03:05.275 --> 03:07.893
the go-between
for Arthur and Teo.

03:09.112 --> 03:10.946
No, that's Helen.

03:11.013 --> 03:15.284
Helen and Teresa
are the same person.

03:15.351 --> 03:18.019
Auggie,
Helen is still alive.

03:38.341 --> 03:39.808
You know, they say

03:39.876 --> 03:41.393
if you throw a coin
in this fountain,

03:41.478 --> 03:43.879
you'll have crazy sex
with me all night long.

03:43.930 --> 03:45.564
I'm pretty sure
throwing a coin in the Trevi

03:45.648 --> 03:47.316
means you'll return
to Rome one day.

03:47.383 --> 03:49.651
I must be thinking
of a different fountain.

03:52.388 --> 03:55.691
The meet's on. 12:30,
Bar Mecagni.

03:55.742 --> 03:58.694
Looks like Teo's intel
is panning out.

04:00.229 --> 04:01.363
You okay?

04:01.414 --> 04:02.865
Yeah.

04:02.916 --> 04:04.616
For just a second,
I let myself forget

04:04.701 --> 04:07.086
we were here on a mission.

04:07.170 --> 04:09.204
Then you ruined it.

04:09.255 --> 04:10.756
Let me make it up
to you.

04:18.964 --> 04:21.082
Now we'll come back
to Rome together.

04:21.134 --> 04:23.268
Not for work.

04:23.353 --> 04:25.971
Here's a little token
to remember our promise.

04:28.858 --> 04:31.092
I love it.

04:40.403 --> 04:42.204
You sure you're okay?

04:42.271 --> 04:44.072
I'm fine.

05:04.594 --> 05:06.845
I've been looking for
a hat like that.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.847
Did you buy it here?

05:08.932 --> 05:11.850
If you have a map,
I can show you where.

05:16.406 --> 05:19.858
Hey! Hey!

05:38.428 --> 05:39.511
Go that way!
Cut him off!

05:39.596 --> 05:40.512
Okay.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.133
Whoa!

05:56.613 --> 05:58.113
No. No, no.

06:02.151 --> 06:03.351
No!

06:19.469 --> 06:21.720
Helen!

06:25.174 --> 06:28.777
That was the last time
I saw her.

06:28.845 --> 06:30.429
I woke up
in a jail cell,

06:30.513 --> 06:32.848
and two days later,
Arthur got me out.

06:32.899 --> 06:35.234
He's the one who told me
she was dead.

06:35.318 --> 06:37.736
You think he knew then
she was still alive?

06:37.820 --> 06:38.937
I don't know, but he
knew at some point.

06:39.022 --> 06:40.906
Henry had recent pictures
of them together

06:40.990 --> 06:42.230
in that file he gave you,
right?

06:42.275 --> 06:44.243
I need to talk to Arthur.

06:44.327 --> 06:46.227
I'll drive.

06:48.197 --> 06:52.117
Annie. Auggie.
Were we supposed to meet?

06:52.201 --> 06:53.201
We found some new intel,

06:53.253 --> 06:54.814
and we wanted to
talk to you right away.

06:54.837 --> 06:57.589
Was there something else
on Seth Newman's flash drive?

06:59.575 --> 07:01.743
I know about Helen.

07:01.794 --> 07:02.878
Auggie.

07:02.929 --> 07:03.879
Ooh!
Aah!

07:09.102 --> 07:11.603
Helen arranged
the entire scenario.

07:11.688 --> 07:14.690
The Colombian mark,
the police.

07:14.757 --> 07:16.191
So, she wasn't
really shot?

07:16.258 --> 07:18.944
Mmmm.
Squibs and blood packs.

07:19.028 --> 07:20.428
I didn't know
the truth myself

07:20.480 --> 07:21.730
until she came to me
with the idea

07:21.781 --> 07:23.115
of working
from the shadows.

07:23.199 --> 07:24.933
I helped set her up
with a new identity.

07:24.984 --> 07:27.152
She worked for me
directly.

07:27.236 --> 07:29.104
No one else at the CIA
even knew she existed.

07:29.155 --> 07:30.956
Why wouldn't you
read me in?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.992
Because she needed the world
to believe she was dead,

07:34.077 --> 07:36.945
and the only way to do it
convincingly

07:36.996 --> 07:38.914
was if you believed it too.

07:38.965 --> 07:41.633
I would never compromise
a mission or another operative.

07:41.718 --> 07:43.168
I would have
followed that protocol.

07:43.252 --> 07:46.121
You should have trusted me.
I'm sorry.

07:46.172 --> 07:48.140
You and Teo kept in contact
with her?

07:48.224 --> 07:50.976
Yes, Helen's been our cutout
as needed,

07:51.060 --> 07:53.128
passing messages
between us.

07:53.179 --> 07:54.796
I pulled her in more fully
into Henry's situation

07:54.847 --> 07:56.181
about a week ago.

07:56.265 --> 07:57.182
Why?

07:57.266 --> 07:58.400
Because
she's been working

07:58.467 --> 08:00.485
on sensitive
counter-proliferation missions.

08:00.570 --> 08:01.737
She has
an extensive knowledge

08:01.804 --> 08:03.165
of global arms
trafficking networks

08:03.239 --> 08:04.360
and all the players
involved.

08:04.407 --> 08:05.490
You had her look into

08:05.575 --> 08:07.526
the five missing missiles
from Vienna.

08:07.610 --> 08:09.494
Yes, and she found out
that Henry paid

08:09.579 --> 08:13.699
an Interpol officer named
Sabino Laurent to steal them.

08:13.783 --> 08:16.151
Henry's going to Lyon
on Monday to make a deal,

08:16.202 --> 08:18.787
and Helen's going tonight
to Lyon.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.956
You want me
to go with her.

08:21.007 --> 08:22.424
Why?

08:22.491 --> 08:25.043
Because Annie's
import/export NOC

08:25.128 --> 08:27.462
combined with Helen's
experience in arms trafficking

08:27.513 --> 08:30.432
makes you two
the ideal team for this.

08:30.499 --> 08:31.499
It's a two-person job.

08:31.551 --> 08:32.500
You squeeze Sabino
from both sides

08:32.552 --> 08:33.835
and take the missiles

08:33.885 --> 08:35.804
before Henry has
a chance to use 'em.

08:35.855 --> 08:37.688
Use 'em? You think
he's gonna fire 'em?

08:37.774 --> 08:38.857
Well, he doesn't need to.

08:38.941 --> 08:39.857
He can already prove

08:39.942 --> 08:40.859
that I've been giving money

08:40.943 --> 08:41.977
to a known ALC terrorist.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.645
He wants revenge
for Jai's death.

08:43.696 --> 08:45.176
He's not interested
in taking me down.

08:45.198 --> 08:46.698
He wants to bury me.

08:46.783 --> 08:47.816
Imagine if he could prove

08:47.867 --> 08:49.468
that I've been providing
arms to Teo too,

08:49.518 --> 08:51.737
outside of normal
CIA channels?

08:51.821 --> 08:53.855
Yeah, sounds like
you're in deep shit

08:53.906 --> 08:55.857
get somebody else
to go to Lyon.

08:55.908 --> 08:57.376
This affects all of us,
Auggie.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.212
Henry's a scorched earth
kind of guy.

09:00.296 --> 09:03.298
I'm going.

09:03.365 --> 09:06.501
I was there when
the missiles were taken.

09:06.552 --> 09:08.253
I can be on a plane
tonight.

09:08.337 --> 09:09.471
Thanks, Annie.

09:09.538 --> 09:10.872
You want to talk about
what happened in there?

09:10.923 --> 09:12.724
Not really.

09:12.809 --> 09:14.893
You punched Arthur
in the face.

09:14.977 --> 09:16.595
He's been lying to me
for years

09:16.679 --> 09:19.214
for no good reason.

09:20.983 --> 09:22.550
The only other time
you've done something like this

09:22.602 --> 09:23.935
was after Parker.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.055
I dealt with my feelings
for Helen seven years ago.

09:27.106 --> 09:29.557
If that's true,

09:29.609 --> 09:31.559
why do you still
have photos of her?

09:31.611 --> 09:33.111
I don't know.
I just do.

09:33.196 --> 09:34.746
It's not like
I look at 'em.

09:38.117 --> 09:39.584
Would you have
told me about this

09:39.669 --> 09:43.672
if circumstances
didn't force your hand?

09:43.739 --> 09:46.908
Honestly, I don't know.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.844
So it's not,
"no more secrets."

09:48.911 --> 09:51.213
I have been in intelligence
since I got out of college.

09:51.264 --> 09:52.547
I have secrets
even I can't remember.

09:52.598 --> 09:54.516
I don't understand
what you want from me here.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.967
I just want to talk
to you.

09:56.052 --> 09:58.019
You're going on a mission
with my dead ex-girlfriend.

09:58.087 --> 10:00.021
What more is there to say?

10:00.089 --> 10:01.640
Wife.

10:04.593 --> 10:07.112
So, there's a lot more
to say.

10:09.949 --> 10:11.616
You're leaving
in two hours.

10:11.701 --> 10:13.785
You really want to
do this right now?

10:37.844 --> 10:39.644
Hello, Auggie.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.897
Helen?

10:44.792 --> 10:46.153
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:47.406 --> 10:48.625
Arthur called.?

10:48.899 --> 10:50.867
I figured since the cat
was out of the bag,

10:50.935 --> 10:52.302
this meeting
was inevitable.

10:52.353 --> 10:53.970
So, you broke into
my apartment

10:54.021 --> 10:56.172
to avoid
an awkward reunion?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.441
I couldn't exactly
wait in the hall.

10:58.508 --> 11:01.344
You didn't have to
come here at all.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.279
I needed to talk to you.

11:04.681 --> 11:07.033
Seems like everyone
needs to talk these days.

11:07.117 --> 11:09.685
I'm about to go on a mission
with your girlfriend.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.537
Arthur tells me she's solid,

11:11.622 --> 11:14.040
but I wanted to hear your
assessment of her fieldwork.

11:18.162 --> 11:20.079
This is the first time
you've contacted me

11:20.164 --> 11:22.415
after pretending to be dead
for seven years.

11:22.499 --> 11:25.368
There's a lot of stuff
we should talk about.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.370
A credit report
on my girlfriend

11:27.421 --> 11:29.589
is not high on that list.

11:29.673 --> 11:32.425
Arthur already told you
what can be declassified.

11:32.509 --> 11:34.210
Don't hide
behind the clearance.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.850
Okay.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.053
Here's what I can
tell you.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.571
The work I've been doing
since going dark

11:45.656 --> 11:47.556
has involved
inserting myself

11:47.608 --> 11:50.226
into tactical situations
that weren't possible before.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.560
You mean,
when we were married.

11:51.612 --> 11:53.997
Our marriage
was for the Agency.

11:54.064 --> 11:57.617
You got confused about what
the relationship really was.

11:57.701 --> 12:00.870
You know, it may have
started off as a cover,

12:00.921 --> 12:02.505
but it didn't stay
that way.

12:02.572 --> 12:06.092
It did for me.

12:08.178 --> 12:12.348
You would say "I love you"
when no one else was around.

12:12.416 --> 12:14.634
How was that
part of your cover?

12:17.087 --> 12:19.689
It was a long time ago,
Auggie.

12:23.644 --> 12:25.478
Who are you?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.116
I haven't changed.

12:31.285 --> 12:32.402
I'm the same person
I was then.

12:32.453 --> 12:34.537
You just saw what
you wanted to see.

12:40.828 --> 12:44.113
You don't have to worry
about Annie.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.667
She can keep up with you
and then some.

13:08.138 --> 13:11.307
Helen?

13:11.358 --> 13:13.076
Annie.

13:15.746 --> 13:17.146
Sit wherever you'd like.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.261
Our target is
Sabino Laurent,

13:32.329 --> 13:34.714
Interpol's
chief munitions officer.

13:34.798 --> 13:35.882
And the plan is?

13:35.966 --> 13:37.467
You'll appraise your NOC
as Annie Walker.

13:37.518 --> 13:39.668
Importer/exporter,
and confront Sabino

13:39.720 --> 13:41.020
about your missing missiles.

13:41.105 --> 13:42.105
And what are you
gonna do?

13:42.139 --> 13:43.389
I'll pose
as an MI6 officer

13:43.474 --> 13:45.191
investigating
the missiles.

13:45.275 --> 13:48.227
He'll be desperate to unload
them long before Monday.

13:48.312 --> 13:51.013
Why'd you go dark
seven years ago?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.115
Unless it's about
this mission,

13:52.182 --> 13:53.366
I'd rather not talk.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.067
I like to keep focused.

13:55.152 --> 13:57.069
It's just that I've never
heard of a person

13:57.154 --> 13:58.654
doing what you did.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.323
I'm curious.

14:00.374 --> 14:02.525
No.

14:02.576 --> 14:05.361
You were wondering how
I could do it to Auggie.

14:05.412 --> 14:09.665
You're protecting him.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.218
But as long as we're talking,
you should know,

14:12.302 --> 14:14.537
I have serious concerns
about your ability

14:14.588 --> 14:16.589
to make objective decisions
in the field.

14:16.673 --> 14:20.510
Henry Wilcox offered you a job
at his consulting firm.

14:20.561 --> 14:22.812
You turned it down.
Why?

14:22.879 --> 14:24.564
How do you know that?

14:24.648 --> 14:25.598
Does it matter?

14:25.682 --> 14:27.716
I made a judgment call.

14:27.768 --> 14:29.528
You had a prime opportunity
to embed yourself

14:29.570 --> 14:31.554
right beside your target,
and you turned it down

14:31.605 --> 14:33.105
because you despise him.

14:33.190 --> 14:34.907
You made
an emotional decision.

14:34.992 --> 14:35.908
Wrong.

14:35.993 --> 14:37.243
Henry wanted me to see it

14:37.327 --> 14:38.611
as a chance
to spy on him,

14:38.695 --> 14:41.697
but I saw it for what
it really was--

14:41.748 --> 14:43.583
a ploy to keep me close.

14:43.667 --> 14:46.586
Still,
an interesting decision.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.705
Don't worry
about my decisions.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.707
They've served me well
so far.

15:03.053 --> 15:05.471
Hey, Auggie,
sorry we're late.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.607
We had to stop
for a milkshake.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.091
Breakfast of champions.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.978
I got you one.
That's a chocolate explosion.

15:12.062 --> 15:13.946
Whoa, nice digs!

15:14.031 --> 15:15.031
Where should we
set up?

15:15.098 --> 15:16.949
What are you guys
doing here?

15:17.034 --> 15:17.994
You emailed us yesterday

15:18.068 --> 15:19.368
and invited us over,
remember?

15:19.436 --> 15:21.270
Something about
a super secret project?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.938
Yeah, right. Sorry.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.124
You can set up
on the credenza.

15:28.745 --> 15:30.463
Are you all right,
man?

15:30.547 --> 15:31.797
Yep.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.833
Just didn't sleep
very well.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.968
Nothing a few gallons
of coffee can't cure.

15:36.053 --> 15:38.137
Hey, listen,
before you get set up,

15:38.222 --> 15:41.257
you guys should know,
this is off-book

15:41.308 --> 15:43.059
and unsanctioned,

15:43.126 --> 15:44.727
so if anyone
finds out about this,

15:44.794 --> 15:46.846
we could lose our jobs,
maybe worse.

15:46.930 --> 15:48.848
You had me at pizza.

15:48.932 --> 15:52.468
I assume there will be
pizza, right?

15:52.519 --> 15:55.137
Okay.

15:55.188 --> 16:00.309
Now, this is
a 1.8 gigapixel image

16:00.360 --> 16:02.978
taken by
a surveillance drone.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.983
Nothing's happening.
Exactly.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.752
When you click on
this image,

16:09.819 --> 16:11.671
it should automatically
zoom in.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.356
We should be able
to click on those trees

16:13.373 --> 16:15.675
until we can count
the veins in the leaves.

16:15.759 --> 16:16.825
It's a lot of data
to rebuild.

16:16.877 --> 16:20.263
Offbook and on-point.
This is awesome.

16:20.330 --> 16:23.883
Hey, there's nothing
awesome about this, Eric.

16:23.967 --> 16:26.385
We are risking our careers
and our freedoms

16:26.470 --> 16:30.339
because people's lives
are at stake.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.358
I'm really sorry, man.

16:32.442 --> 16:35.194
I mean, I'm here to help,
whatever it takes.

16:37.013 --> 16:39.315
All right,
let's get to work.

16:48.430 --> 16:49.813
I informed Tarel Birkin

16:49.898 --> 16:52.349
that I was aborting
the mission.

16:52.434 --> 16:54.001
He left the hotel first.

16:54.085 --> 16:57.137
I waited 15 minutes,

16:57.188 --> 16:59.639
and then I exited
through the front entrance.

16:59.691 --> 17:03.977
Outside, I was overpowered
by Gunter Schmid.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.338
He took me
to Stavros' apartment.

17:06.388 --> 17:09.590
I believed that they
were going to kill me.

17:09.675 --> 17:13.044
I fought them both off until
I could get Gunter's gun,

17:13.096 --> 17:15.814
and I used it against them.

17:15.881 --> 17:19.151
I left the scene
immediately and flew out of--

17:29.028 --> 17:30.195
Robert Bernard.

17:30.246 --> 17:32.164
Robbie B.

17:32.231 --> 17:33.749
Calder Michaels.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.401
Calder Michaels.
Jesus.

17:36.452 --> 17:37.919
You sound like hell.

17:38.004 --> 17:39.838
Because I've been here
all night.

17:39.905 --> 17:41.623
It's called dedication.

17:41.708 --> 17:43.592
You should look it up sometime.
It's under "D."

17:43.676 --> 17:45.427
You finally got
that big promotion

17:45.511 --> 17:47.295
and now you actually have to
work for a living, huh?

17:47.380 --> 17:48.680
Yeah.

17:48.748 --> 17:49.965
What can I do for you?

17:50.049 --> 17:51.717
I'm going through
my operative's report

17:51.768 --> 17:53.418
from the Dion Stavros mission,

17:53.469 --> 17:55.771
and I wanted to take a look
at the crime scene photos,

17:55.855 --> 17:58.607
but your lazy ass hasn't
uploaded them to the server yet.

17:58.691 --> 18:00.609
Let's look at them
together.

18:04.764 --> 18:06.982
What exactly
are we looking for?

18:08.451 --> 18:10.652
Well, nothing specific.

18:10.737 --> 18:12.621
I was just curious
about their injuries.

18:12.705 --> 18:14.740
Wounds look big.

18:14.791 --> 18:16.658
You know the caliber yet?

18:16.743 --> 18:18.710
Well, the victims were
shot with a .45.

18:20.546 --> 18:22.330
What were they packing?

18:22.415 --> 18:24.633
Stavros was unarmed.

18:24.717 --> 18:26.618
The big fellow
was carrying a 9-millimeter.

18:26.669 --> 18:30.505
I take it that means the .45
belongs to your operative?

18:33.309 --> 18:34.893
I fought them both off

18:34.960 --> 18:37.462
until I could get
Gunter's gun,

18:37.513 --> 18:38.680
and I used it against them.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.183
Robert, can you get me
security camera footage

18:41.267 --> 18:42.734
from the Imperial Hotel?

18:42.802 --> 18:44.903
- Yeah, you bet.
- Thanks, brother.

18:55.198 --> 18:57.249
Sabino?

18:59.752 --> 19:01.670
Sabino.

19:03.322 --> 19:05.457
Do I know you?

19:05.508 --> 19:06.991
Indirectly.

19:07.043 --> 19:10.161
I'm the owner of the
missile launchers you stole.

19:10.213 --> 19:13.265
I want them back,
and I'm willing to pay.

19:13.332 --> 19:14.332
You must have me
confused

19:14.383 --> 19:15.383
with someone else,
mademoiselle.

19:15.468 --> 19:17.602
Uh, no.
You're Sabino Laurent.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.889
You're in control of Interpol's
munitions clearinghouse.

19:20.973 --> 19:22.841
You're the only man with
the means and opportunity

19:22.892 --> 19:24.893
to turn a van
of 25 missile launchers

19:24.977 --> 19:26.845
into a van of 20.

19:26.896 --> 19:28.897
And you can do it without
anyone else knowing,

19:28.981 --> 19:32.150
but the thing is...
I know.

19:35.788 --> 19:38.240
And what is this
incriminating information

19:38.324 --> 19:39.624
you claim to have?

19:39.692 --> 19:42.878
You had two opportunities
to return to the DGSE,

19:42.962 --> 19:44.462
and you turned them
both down.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.748
Nobody chooses to stay
at Interpol.

19:46.833 --> 19:49.551
The pay's a joke.
And the work's boring.

19:49.635 --> 19:53.371
But you chose to stay
because you're making a mint...

19:55.591 --> 19:58.760
Stealing impounded weapons
and selling them.

19:58.845 --> 20:01.346
Like my missile launchers.

20:04.717 --> 20:05.984
My card.

20:06.051 --> 20:09.271
There's a number
for a crime tip line on back.

20:09.355 --> 20:11.439
Feel free to call anytime.

20:11.524 --> 20:14.442
I'm sure my superiors will have
no issue taking my word

20:14.527 --> 20:16.912
over that
of an admitted arms trafficker.

20:16.996 --> 20:19.497
I don't want to make trouble
for you.

20:23.002 --> 20:26.338
I want...to make a deal.

20:36.349 --> 20:38.717
I set him up.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.770
Get ready to knock him down.

20:52.481 --> 20:53.732
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

21:01.774 --> 21:04.626
Emily Howard.
MI-6.

21:06.245 --> 21:07.662
What is this regarding?

21:07.747 --> 21:10.465
Five stolen Stinger missiles.

21:10.549 --> 21:11.833
Forgive me, mademoiselle,

21:11.918 --> 21:13.802
but how does this fall under
MI-6 purview?

21:13.886 --> 21:15.553
We've had eyes
on Dion Stavros

21:15.621 --> 21:17.923
since he was dealing
to the I.R.A.

21:17.974 --> 21:20.008
Now he sells
to numerous terror groups

21:20.092 --> 21:21.626
operating within the U.K.

21:21.677 --> 21:23.812
So if weapons he owns
have suddenly vanished,

21:23.896 --> 21:25.730
we'd like to know who has them.

21:25.798 --> 21:27.182
This is the first time
I'm hearing

21:27.266 --> 21:28.566
of anything being missing.

21:28.634 --> 21:29.985
I find that
deeply concerning,

21:30.069 --> 21:31.636
considering the missiles
disappeared

21:31.687 --> 21:32.988
while under your supervision.

21:33.072 --> 21:34.656
I need to see every scrap
of paper you have

21:34.740 --> 21:36.808
regarding those missiles
straightaway,

21:36.859 --> 21:39.310
and then you and I are going to
inventory the clearinghouse.

21:39.362 --> 21:41.163
You have no authority
to order such an action.

21:41.247 --> 21:43.314
Your boss Benoit Collet does.

21:43.366 --> 21:45.200
He's already given
his approval

21:45.284 --> 21:47.335
and assured me you'd be
at my full disposal

21:47.420 --> 21:49.955
until my investigation
is complete.

21:50.006 --> 21:52.490
Perhaps I should call
Monsieur Collet myself.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.325
You're about to call
your boss's boss

21:54.377 --> 21:57.045
at home on the weekend
to question his directives?

21:57.129 --> 22:00.131
We have a phrase for that
at MI-6.

22:00.182 --> 22:02.384
Incredibly bloody stupid.

22:25.624 --> 22:27.375
<i>Oui.</i>

22:33.249 --> 22:35.033
My apologies, Ms. Howard.

22:35.084 --> 22:38.420
Monsieur Collet has just
explained the situation to me.

22:38.504 --> 22:41.222
I'd like to offer my full
attention to your investigation.

22:41.307 --> 22:45.209
We could meet later for dinner
to discuss your needs.

22:45.261 --> 22:47.512
8:00, Les Adrets?

22:47.563 --> 22:49.714
Perfect.

23:05.998 --> 23:08.249
Ms. Walker.
Sabino speaking.

23:08.334 --> 23:11.086
Perhaps we can do business
after all.

23:11.170 --> 23:15.757
Arthur. Your pal Collet
came through in a big way.

23:15.841 --> 23:19.127
Whatever favor he owed you--
consider it paid in full.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.993
Hey, what's Annie
up to tonight?

24:01.247 --> 24:02.547
She's working.

24:03.004 --> 24:04.404
Oh.

24:04.456 --> 24:06.674
Oh, cool.

24:06.741 --> 24:08.175
Cool.

24:09.928 --> 24:10.878
What?

24:15.684 --> 24:18.185
Is there something
you two wanna ask me?

24:21.056 --> 24:23.590
- It's just--
- N-no.

24:25.226 --> 24:29.730
It's...just there's
this rumor...

24:29.781 --> 24:31.865
Going around that, um,

24:31.933 --> 24:34.318
you and Annie started dating.

24:34.402 --> 24:36.320
Hmm.

24:36.404 --> 24:39.323
You hear this rumor, Hollman?
I want no part of this.

24:39.407 --> 24:41.325
You want to know
if it's true.

24:41.409 --> 24:42.943
I don't mean to overstep...

24:42.994 --> 24:45.162
But, yes, I want to know
if it's true, please.

24:45.246 --> 24:47.498
What's the consensus
at Langley?

24:47.582 --> 24:49.917
- 60/40 in favor of.
- Where do you fall in there?

24:49.968 --> 24:53.087
Ah, see, honestly...

24:53.138 --> 24:54.471
I'm not sure.

24:54.556 --> 24:56.090
I mean, I'd like to think

24:56.141 --> 24:58.058
that you guys are together,
but if you're not,

24:58.126 --> 25:00.006
I hope you are doing
everything humanly possible

25:00.061 --> 25:01.595
to make it happen, 'cause...

25:01.646 --> 25:04.431
'Cause you hit the jackpot.

25:04.482 --> 25:06.800
You did.
You hit the jackpot

25:06.851 --> 25:10.938
when you got assigned
to be her handler.

25:10.989 --> 25:14.408
When are you ever gonna find
another girl like that?

25:14.475 --> 25:16.026
Are you guys hungry?

25:16.111 --> 25:18.779
- Constantly.
- Let's get that pizza.

25:23.835 --> 25:25.369
Here.
You're not coming?

25:25.453 --> 25:27.004
No. Bring me back a slice.

25:27.088 --> 25:29.156
I gotta go into Langley
for something.

25:39.834 --> 25:42.002
Joan, you got a minute?

25:42.053 --> 25:43.336
Yeah, sure.
Come in.

25:43.388 --> 25:44.671
What's up?

25:44.722 --> 25:46.723
I'm wondering...

25:46.808 --> 25:49.176
How do you determine...

25:49.227 --> 25:51.011
Pairings for operations?

25:53.347 --> 25:56.516
Well, we take into account
the Myers-Briggs assessment,

25:56.568 --> 25:59.153
personal background,
interests, work experience.

25:59.204 --> 26:01.905
Standard compatibility
regression matching.

26:03.575 --> 26:06.076
You're wondering why
I assigned Annie to you.

26:06.161 --> 26:09.163
I'm just curious
how these decisions are made.

26:09.214 --> 26:13.083
Annie needed someone
to ground her.

26:13.168 --> 26:16.170
And you needed someone to force
you out of your comfort zone.

26:16.221 --> 26:17.421
- Comfort zone.
- Yeah.

26:17.505 --> 26:20.040
You constantly push each other,
and as a result,

26:20.091 --> 26:22.676
you continue to evolve
as people and operatives

26:22.727 --> 26:25.179
in ways that never cease
to impress me.

26:25.230 --> 26:28.482
But the truth is...

26:28.549 --> 26:30.934
You were also the guy
available that day.

26:31.019 --> 26:35.572
Do any of these pairings
ever go the distance?

26:35.657 --> 26:37.524
In this line of work...

26:37.575 --> 26:40.694
We're good liars to begin with.

26:40.745 --> 26:44.064
The Agency trains us
to be better liars.

26:44.115 --> 26:46.667
We use lies to protect
our friends

26:46.734 --> 26:48.785
and fool our enemies, but...

26:48.870 --> 26:52.923
At the end of the day,
a lie is still a lie.

26:53.007 --> 26:55.909
Some relationships
can survive in these conditions,

26:55.960 --> 26:59.379
but...
the reality is most don't.

27:06.354 --> 27:07.754
Hey.

27:07.805 --> 27:10.307
You find what you need
at the office?

27:10.391 --> 27:12.976
Not sure.
How's it going?

27:13.061 --> 27:16.146
I think...We've...Got it.

27:16.231 --> 27:18.148
Now we go through
every last pixel.

27:18.233 --> 27:19.816
What are we looking for,
exactly?

27:19.901 --> 27:21.535
Anything that doesn't belong
in a jungle.

27:25.657 --> 27:27.207
Uh...

27:27.275 --> 27:28.942
Do humans fit that bill?

27:28.993 --> 27:30.160
I say so.
What'd you find?

27:30.245 --> 27:32.012
Two men.
One looks...

27:32.080 --> 27:33.313
Latino.

27:33.381 --> 27:35.082
The other--whoa!

27:35.149 --> 27:36.967
You are not gonna believe
who it is.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.952
Henry Wilcox.

27:50.398 --> 27:52.149
First you miss the meet

27:52.233 --> 27:53.800
we were supposed to have
an hour ago,

27:53.851 --> 27:55.172
then you show up
at my safe house?

27:55.186 --> 27:56.803
We're not supposed to
know each other.

27:56.854 --> 27:58.105
If anybody saw you
come in here,

27:58.156 --> 27:59.973
you could have blown
the entire mission.

28:00.024 --> 28:03.026
Henry's here.
We need to leave Lyon ASAP

28:03.111 --> 28:05.329
and reassess.
I can't cut bait and run.

28:05.413 --> 28:07.981
I'm meeting Sabino
at a dock on the Rhone.

28:08.032 --> 28:10.500
What part of "he's here"
don't you understand?

28:10.585 --> 28:12.252
It's a setup.
To do what? Kill me?

28:12.320 --> 28:14.788
I don't think so.
If Henry wanted me dead,

28:14.839 --> 28:16.506
he's had plenty
of opportunities.

28:16.591 --> 28:18.125
Then why is he here
two days early?

28:18.176 --> 28:20.127
Henry Wilcox doesn't just
drop everything on a whim.

28:20.178 --> 28:23.046
And get on a plane.
I can't leave-not yet.

28:23.131 --> 28:26.499
I can turn Sabino--I can get him
to sell me these missiles.

28:26.551 --> 28:28.335
Why are you being
so obstinate?

28:28.386 --> 28:30.270
If I ran every time
my life was in danger,

28:30.338 --> 28:31.888
I'd never complete a mission.

28:31.973 --> 28:34.725
I know where
those missiles are today.

28:34.809 --> 28:36.727
If I don't act,
I lose them forever.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.363
Every win for Henry
is another log on the fire.

28:39.447 --> 28:41.531
He's building to burn
the people I care about,

28:41.616 --> 28:43.650
and I am not gonna
let that happen.

28:43.701 --> 28:46.870
That's exactly why
you're gonna fail.

28:49.779 --> 28:51.039
Two weeks before I went dark,

28:51.224 --> 28:53.091
Auggie and I went
to plant a bug,

28:53.092 --> 28:54.781
in the office of a man
we believed

28:54.782 --> 28:56.283
was laundering money
for Dev Sol.

28:56.350 --> 28:59.219
Auggie was planting a
listening device in the office.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.071
I was supposed to install
a signal relay

29:01.155 --> 29:03.106
across the street.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.795
The target
was a dangerous man.

29:24.879 --> 29:26.463
If there was even
the suspicion

29:26.547 --> 29:28.348
that someone
in his organization

29:28.415 --> 29:31.134
was working against him...
they disappeared.

29:31.219 --> 29:33.753
The situation of protocol
is to never risk

29:33.805 --> 29:36.256
revealing yourself unless
your life is at risk...

29:36.307 --> 29:38.258
and you have no choice.

29:40.561 --> 29:41.761
But in that moment,

29:41.813 --> 29:43.493
I didn't care about
preserving the mission.

29:43.564 --> 29:47.033
The only thing I cared about
was saving Auggie.

29:48.102 --> 29:49.736
Hey!

29:51.739 --> 29:53.623
Turns out
he had no intention

29:53.708 --> 29:55.292
of going up to the office.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.745
He was just picking up
a package he left behind.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.797
Had I just kept my cool
and stayed on the roof,

30:00.882 --> 30:02.666
he never would have known
we were there.

30:02.767 --> 30:06.520
But I made
an emotional decision.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.192
In trying to save Auggie,
I endangered both of us.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.171
A week later,
I saw the target on the campus

30:24.255 --> 30:28.258
where Auggie and I were posing
as married grad students.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.502
<i>Viene.</i>

30:39.554 --> 30:41.688
I was blown.

30:41.772 --> 30:43.390
I couldn't stay in Rome.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.192
But Auggie's cover
was still intact.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.944
The target
never knew he was there.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.280
But every second
I stayed with Auggie,

30:50.347 --> 30:51.781
I put him in danger.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.322
Here.

31:03.711 --> 31:05.629
What's wrong?

31:05.696 --> 31:07.881
Nothing.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.173
That night,
I realized what I had to do.

31:52.627 --> 31:53.877
Helen!

31:56.380 --> 31:58.682
I knew if I could
make it through that moment...

31:58.749 --> 32:00.100
Helen!

32:07.725 --> 32:10.110
I could do anything.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.456
If you loved Auggie,

32:23.541 --> 32:25.075
why didn't you
tell him all of this?

32:25.126 --> 32:27.944
You could have left and been
reassigned somewhere together.

32:27.995 --> 32:30.046
You know what getting burned
does to an operative's career.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.281
It ends it.

32:31.332 --> 32:33.500
Going dark freed me up

32:33.584 --> 32:37.170
to become an operative
I never imagined was possible.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.805
What about the tradeoffs?

32:38.889 --> 32:41.558
Only a handful of people
even know you exist.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.294
It's true.
Relationships are a liability.

32:44.345 --> 32:46.146
You have any regrets?

32:46.230 --> 32:47.897
I've been able to do
a lot of good things

32:47.965 --> 32:50.233
in this world.

32:50.301 --> 32:54.070
But leaving Auggie changed
the course of both our lives.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.990
And I have to live with that
every day.

32:58.526 --> 32:59.976
Do you still love him?

33:00.027 --> 33:03.079
I don't even know what
that word means anymore.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.831
Yes, you do.

33:06.367 --> 33:08.118
I know the stakes
are high for you

33:08.169 --> 33:09.669
and the people you care about,

33:09.754 --> 33:11.988
and I know you think
leaving Lyon

33:12.039 --> 33:14.324
means all hope is lost.

33:14.375 --> 33:16.159
But there are other ways
to beat Henry.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.461
Losing one battle
doesn't mean the war is over.

33:18.512 --> 33:21.831
But if you die,
there is no war.

33:24.218 --> 33:25.501
I've come too far.

33:25.553 --> 33:28.638
I'll be smart,
but I'm not backing down.

33:28.689 --> 33:30.690
That's an emotional decision.

33:30.775 --> 33:32.609
I can't be any part of that.

33:32.676 --> 33:34.694
I didn't ask you to be.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.561
The missile launchers
are in the plane.

34:08.646 --> 34:10.980
Did you bring the money?

34:20.224 --> 34:21.991
After this,

34:22.059 --> 34:24.411
my business with Henry Wilcox
is finished.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.779
You know what happens
to people

34:25.862 --> 34:28.581
after they finish their
business with Henry Wilcox.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.083
They die.

34:30.167 --> 34:32.068
He doesn't leave loose ends.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.335
The missiles were never here.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.637
Henry probably has them
halfway across the world by now.

35:24.722 --> 35:27.140
Yeah. The question is
which half?

35:31.679 --> 35:34.314
What time
can the jet be ready?

35:34.398 --> 35:36.733
I'm not going back to D.C.

35:39.069 --> 35:40.820
I hope this won't offend you,

35:40.905 --> 35:43.990
but when we met,
I didn't think much of you.

35:44.074 --> 35:46.526
No. How could anyone
take offense to that?

35:46.610 --> 35:50.029
But I saw something in you
this weekend.

35:50.114 --> 35:53.833
You will run through
brick walls for Auggie...

35:53.918 --> 35:58.488
And Henry will use that against
you every chance he gets.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.958
Seven years ago,
I learned

36:02.009 --> 36:03.676
the most dangerous thing
a spy can do

36:03.761 --> 36:05.328
is fall in love.

36:05.379 --> 36:08.131
I had to make a choice.

36:08.182 --> 36:11.134
Like it or not,
you do too.

36:11.185 --> 36:14.637
Decide what it is
you really wanna do here.

36:14.688 --> 36:17.673
Be with Auggie,
or stop Henry.

36:17.725 --> 36:19.559
There may come a time
when you'll be forced

36:19.643 --> 36:21.177
to choose between the two,

36:21.228 --> 36:24.514
and if you can't...
You're gonna fail at both.

36:33.037 --> 36:34.856
- Auggie.
- We found something.

36:35.518 --> 36:37.435
The Colombian
is Eduardo Vargas..

36:37.924 --> 36:39.541
He's one of Teo's ALC comrades.

36:39.625 --> 36:41.259
He was detained
when Annie and Calder

36:41.327 --> 36:42.711
raided their stronghold.

36:42.795 --> 36:45.180
Henry's been having secret
meetings with ALC rebels.

36:45.264 --> 36:48.350
It's no wonder he had Seth
sneak this out of the building.

36:48.434 --> 36:50.468
It's a safe bet it's been purged
from the CIA database.

36:50.519 --> 36:52.503
Eduardo's
still in CIA custody.

36:52.555 --> 36:54.005
Hopefully we can get him
to tell us

36:54.056 --> 36:55.473
why Henry was in Colombia.

36:58.060 --> 37:01.229
There's something
I need to tell you, Auggie.

37:02.531 --> 37:04.866
When I supported
Helen's choice,

37:04.951 --> 37:07.685
I was making a decision
to help her,

37:07.737 --> 37:10.405
not hurt you.

37:10.489 --> 37:14.075
I'm sorry for the pain
it's caused you over the years.

37:16.712 --> 37:20.415
But I still stand
behind my decision.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.051
So you're sorry,
but you have no regrets.

37:23.135 --> 37:24.702
Well...

37:24.754 --> 37:26.304
since Helen went dark,

37:26.372 --> 37:28.890
the things she's been able
to accomplish are astounding.

37:28.975 --> 37:30.892
Yeah. She's been
a big help to Teo.

37:30.977 --> 37:33.211
- What's that mean?
- You trusted me

37:33.262 --> 37:36.381
to train Teo
and keep your secret.

37:36.432 --> 37:38.383
But when Helen went dark,
you had a choice.

37:38.434 --> 37:40.852
You could be honest
with me or help your son.

37:40.903 --> 37:43.104
You chose Teo.

37:43.189 --> 37:45.273
This is a job of hard choices.

37:45.358 --> 37:46.741
You made those decisions

37:46.826 --> 37:48.860
because you felt
they were for the better good.

37:48.911 --> 37:50.996
But you should know this.

37:51.063 --> 37:53.782
I can't ever trust you again.

38:11.183 --> 38:12.934
Auggie.

38:18.274 --> 38:20.091
You're back.

38:20.142 --> 38:21.426
It wasn't fair of me

38:21.477 --> 38:23.594
to challenge you about
where your head is at.

38:23.646 --> 38:24.929
No, no, come on.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.565
I flew off the handle
at Arthur, I...

38:27.616 --> 38:31.569
I definitely
have some things to think about.

38:33.706 --> 38:36.124
Well, the truth is that--

38:38.210 --> 38:40.278
I'm not totally clear
about my feelings.

38:40.329 --> 38:44.132
I have a lot that I need
to think about too.

38:46.252 --> 38:47.635
Meaning what?

38:54.560 --> 38:57.962
The last few days
with Helen have been...

39:00.850 --> 39:02.800
Interesting.

39:05.271 --> 39:06.988
After a couple days
with Helen,

39:07.073 --> 39:09.974
you're thinking...

39:10.025 --> 39:12.527
You're feeling
like you can't have love

39:12.611 --> 39:14.446
and be a spy.

39:14.497 --> 39:16.030
Like you have to choose.

39:18.317 --> 39:21.703
This is the part where you're
supposed to refute all that.

39:21.787 --> 39:24.873
Helen is wrong
about a lot of things.

39:27.293 --> 39:31.212
I don't know...
Maybe she's right about that.

39:31.297 --> 39:34.382
Meaning what?

39:34.467 --> 39:37.385
I wanna be with you,
Annie.

39:37.470 --> 39:40.138
I have from the second
you walked into my life.

39:40.189 --> 39:42.440
But since we started this...

39:45.027 --> 39:48.863
It's like we
have never had time...for us.

39:50.316 --> 39:51.866
First Henry and the file

39:51.951 --> 39:53.618
and then Teo and then Helen...

39:53.685 --> 39:56.020
Yeah. And I just keep thinking
that it's gotta stop.

39:56.071 --> 39:57.855
It has to end.
We have to find

39:57.907 --> 40:00.959
someplace more normal,
but...

40:07.466 --> 40:10.084
For people like us,
there is no normal.

40:19.094 --> 40:21.679
What do we do?

40:32.691 --> 40:34.242
I don't know.

40:46.905 --> 40:49.740
I don't know either.

40:52.428 --> 40:54.179
But I know that...
If the only thing

40:54.246 --> 40:56.681
we can agree on
is the fact that we don't know,

40:56.748 --> 40:58.716
that's not good enough.

41:05.474 --> 41:08.560
So is that it, is this...

41:08.611 --> 41:09.644
The end?

41:19.205 --> 41:21.372
I think so.

41:21.397 --> 41:26.397
