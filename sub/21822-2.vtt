WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:04.720
OK, Steven, ready to go?

00:04.800 --> 00:07.840
Oh! Have I introduced you
to our client Nick Swivney?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.840
Yeah, whatever.
Can we just get on with this, please?

00:10.920 --> 00:13.360
Um, Steven? This is Clem Fandango.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.040
Yeah, I know who you are.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.520
Can you hear me?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.320
Yeah, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800
What do you want?

00:22.880 --> 00:26.760
-Just letting you know we're ready to go.
-He just said that!

00:26.840 --> 00:29.120
[sighs] You two are unbelievable!

00:32.680 --> 00:35.680
The smooth taste of Red Carpet cigarettes

00:35.760 --> 00:39.040
is coming
to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.840
Everybody knows that cigarettes
are good for you.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.720
Red Carpet cigarettes.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.520
Once you smoke one, you'll want more

00:47.600 --> 00:49.560
and more and more

00:49.640 --> 00:54.640
and more and more and more and more.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.800
[Nick] Yes!

00:55.880 --> 00:57.920
[laughs]

01:00.360 --> 01:02.880
-No!
-[Nick] That went well.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.520
The lady, Jane. She's a fine, fine woman.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.240
She's your agent, yes?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.400
Yeah, she's my agent.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.160
You are fucking her, yes? Eh?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.880
-[Nick laughs]
-[Toast] No, I'm not.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.800
-Am I done here?
-Tell Jane, hello from me.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.600
[laughs]

01:22.360 --> 01:24.840
Eh? [laughs]

01:52.520 --> 01:55.240
-India, which bloody button do I press?
-[India]  You just press play.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.840
Yes, I know!

02:01.480 --> 02:03.480
-Killer whales?
-I'm sure they train you.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.800
Couple of hours in the morning,

02:04.880 --> 02:07.400
you'd be performing with them
in the pool by lunchtime.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.440
Why would you even suggest this, Jane?
I'm an actor,

02:10.520 --> 02:12.800
not a bloody whale charmer,
for Christ's sake.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.840
You might want to watch your language
and remember who you're talking to.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.040
[inhales deeply] Ah, murder mystery.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.440
Vengeful husband.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.800
Rula Lenska's already said yes
to the wife...

02:25.640 --> 02:26.520
Cats.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.800
Children's television.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.280
[Toast]  Good God, never again.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.520
So, who's going on their holidays
this week?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.960
That's right, it's Jennifer.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.360
Off you go, Steven.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.840
I wonder where Jennifer's going.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.240
-Oh, shit man. You're fucking kidding.
-[woman screams]

02:53.920 --> 02:56.440
How did you get on with Nick Swivney?

02:56.520 --> 02:59.520
You know, he's trying to flog cigarettes
to the Congo?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.280
The poorest people in the world.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.440
Yes. They're rather tasty actually.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.120
Why put me up for something like that?

03:06.200 --> 03:09.960
You're concerned for ethical reasons or
because someone might find out about it?

03:10.040 --> 03:11.760
Because someone might find out about it.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.600
Why can't you find me something decent?

03:13.680 --> 03:16.880
I suggest a little rethink
on the Norris Flipjack advert.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.520
-Mm-mm.
-You'll be shooting it

03:18.600 --> 03:20.840
at his extensive woodland estate.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.080
-No, I won't.
-It's mega money, Toast.

03:23.160 --> 03:27.560
And any advert directed by Flipjack
has "quality" written all over it.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.960
Nope.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.680
Fantastic! This is going to be great.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.160
Now, where's my star?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.760
There he is.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.720
Fashionably late.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.320
[Ray] Hey, Jackie. How you doing?
Phil, you old tiger!

03:45.400 --> 03:49.640
Barry! Chris!
Hey, Maxine, you're looking good!

03:49.720 --> 03:51.760
Thanks, Ray.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.560
-Ray bloody Purchase.
-Toast.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.840
How you feeling this morning, Ray?

03:56.920 --> 04:00.320
Well, what a night. This cat
really knows how to throw a party.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.720
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you, Toast?

04:02.800 --> 04:05.040
Because you weren't invited.
How embarrassing.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.960
Right! Let's make an advert.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.480
I'm ready, let's go.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.840
[Norris] You heard him. Let's go.
OK, first positions.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.040

-Right, that's lunch.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.720
You jumped-up prick.

04:42.800 --> 04:48.080
Whatever petty crap exists between you
and Ray Purchase is of no interest to me.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.440
But if it starts to jeopardize
the making of my advert--

04:52.520 --> 04:56.680
I've gotta be honest with you, Flipjack,
I hate everything about your advert.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.400
What kind of arsehole
doesn't like my adverts?

04:59.480 --> 05:02.200
-[snorts] This kind of arsehole.
-[cocks gun]

05:03.280 --> 05:05.440
It's clearly a prop gun, Flipjack.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.040
Really? Well, let's see, shall we?

05:08.120 --> 05:12.560
If you don't say, "I'm sorry, Norris,
I love your adverts," I...

05:13.280 --> 05:15.080
Put down that fox!

05:15.160 --> 05:18.040

05:25.000 --> 05:27.560
Ah, didn't expect that, did you, Flipjack?

05:28.200 --> 05:30.760
You see, Toast, what you don't know...

05:31.440 --> 05:35.400
-You see, Flipjack, what you don't know--
-How's the barbecue going, guys?

05:36.760 --> 05:38.920
-He was barbecuing a fox!
-I wasn't barbecuing it.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
-I was roasting it on a spit.
-It's the kind of thing

05:41.080 --> 05:43.640
that goes on all the time
in the countryside, Toast. Get used to it.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.760
-Now, I fancy a fox burger.
-Tuck in, Ray.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.040
There you go, Toast.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
What's this for?

05:51.080 --> 05:55.800

And he was barbecuing foxes, you say?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.280
He was. He had one on a spit.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.880
I believe he's in
the Countryside Alliance.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.800
He can do what he likes.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.360
But as I told you,
best not to cross Norris Flipjack.

06:59.440 --> 07:04.280
-He will crush you like that.
-[shattering sounds]

07:04.360 --> 07:05.880
[splash]

07:06.760 --> 07:09.200
Yes. Well, I'm done
with all these shit jobs, Jane.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.840
I've got a few quid in the bank.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.960
It's not like I'm facing
a massive tax bill any time soon.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.600
[Ray] Good afternoon, I'd like to report
Steven Gonville Toast for tax evasion.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.440
Unfortunately, Ray Purchase
has reported you to the tax people.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.680
[wheezes] Why is he such a grass?

07:30.760 --> 07:32.280
You know, I could kill him with a spoon.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.160
That may be so, but brace yourself, Toast.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.840
You now owe the tax people...
a quarter of a million pounds.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.440
[wheezes] Oh, God!

07:40.320 --> 07:42.360
I thought you took care of
all the tax stuff, Jane?

07:44.520 --> 07:45.520
Jane!

07:47.360 --> 07:50.840
Look, you may have to take a few jobs that
don't particularly appeal for a while,

07:50.920 --> 07:53.520
but this  Harry Potter  show will be great.

07:53.600 --> 07:58.160
When I got into this profession, I had
no intention of entertaining anybody.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.160
Least of all children.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.560
Actors can't always
pick and choose, Toast.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.280
Even very successful ones.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.560
I know when things were a little lax
for John Nettles last year,

08:08.640 --> 08:11.040
-he turned to a spot of poaching.
-Poaching?

08:11.120 --> 08:14.000
Yes. Just to put food on the table
before his next job at the National.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.360
-Really?
-Shall we?

08:18.360 --> 08:21.640
Everything going well, Eric?
Still on the  EastEnders?

08:22.400 --> 08:25.160
"Leave it out, Pat." [laughs]

08:28.160 --> 08:29.160
[door opens]

08:29.240 --> 08:31.760
-What the hell was that?
-Sounds like the back door.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.799
[pants]

08:36.640 --> 08:38.080
Thirty quid, the lot.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.880
How many rabbits?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.280
-Three.
-That's not a rabbit.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.800
-Looks more like a squirrel.
-It's a rabbit.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.080
I don't think so, John.
We'd have to skin them and all that.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.320
But Juliet Stevenson could do
all that for you, for an extra tenner.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.520
Not really that keen.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.040
Oh, right.
Well, I'll try Tim Pigott-Smith.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.960
Oh, God. You can't help yourself, can you?

09:01.480 --> 09:04.200
-What do you mean, can't help myself?
-Name drop.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.880
You can't get a sentence out

09:05.960 --> 09:08.880
without John Mills this
or Tim Pigott-Smith that.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.520
Go easy, Toast. Poor man's on his uppers.

09:11.600 --> 09:17.040
Ah, you're right. I'm sorry, Nettles.
Good luck with your rabbits.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.640
And, uh, give my love to the family.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.440
[groans] I'll try Hugh fucking Bonneville.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
[Ed sighs]

09:26.240 --> 09:28.840
I hope I never have to do
anything like that, Ed.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.960
[sighs] Well, looks like
we're on for another train strike, Toast.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.360
Thatcher would've sorted that out

09:34.440 --> 09:36.280
-with a single phone call to Cobra.
-Indeed.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.120
Hope you're not thinking
of going anywhere.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.320
That's the least of my troubles, Ed.
Jane's got me doing these shitty jobs

09:41.400 --> 09:42.480
to pay off that tax bill.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.320
How was that  Harry Potter  show?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.160
The director was a wanker.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.680
They're all useless.
I don't respect any of them.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.640
-In fact, I don't respect anybody.
-Really?

09:52.720 --> 09:57.760
Yeah, I can't think of a single person
on this earth that I have any respect for.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.520
Have you ever thought of directing, Toast?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.000
[gasps]

10:03.080 --> 10:05.720
Well, that's not a bad idea.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.880
I think I'd be an excellent director,
now you mention it, Ed.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.720
[Ed] Might not be
as easy at it looks, Toast.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.880
-Some actors can be a little difficult.
-[phone rings]

10:16.680 --> 10:17.640
Toast.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.960
Calendar Girls.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.560
-What's that?
-Oh, you must know about it, Toast.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.400
A load of prim, middle-aged women

10:24.480 --> 10:27.000
pose nude for a calendar
to raise money for charity.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.440
-They pose nude for a calendar?
-That's correct.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.480
-The Women's Institute?
-Indeed.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.360
There's one thing I don't get, Jane.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.640
Who the fuck would wanna buy
something like that?

10:36.720 --> 10:39.240
How dare you be so rude
about the WI, Toast?

10:39.880 --> 10:43.200
Anyway, the producer and the director
for some reason are very keen to meet you.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.120
I suggested The Colonial Club
tomorrow afternoon.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.120
-Who are they?
-Duncan Clench and Bob Fennison.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.240
-Never heard of them.
-Oh, one tiny thing.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.040
Bob Fennison has
a very minor facial blemish.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.160
What's the matter with him?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.280
Do you know, it's so minor
I don't even remember.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.440
Anyway, we are well on the way
to paying off

11:00.520 --> 11:03.160
your quarter of a million pound tax bill.
Toodle-oo!

11:04.760 --> 11:06.440
-So, what was that, Toast?
-That was Jane.

11:06.520 --> 11:09.120
She's got me a part
in something called  Calendar Girls.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.480
Hmm. The Women's Institute.
Yes, I have one of those calendars.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.480
Ah, sounds weird. Like niche porn.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.080
The ladies, mostly of the mature variety,
somewhat out of shape, are totally nude.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.000
-Yes, so I gather.
-However, home-made cupcakes

11:24.080 --> 11:27.440
and jars of chutney discreetly obscure
the more intimate parts of their bodies...

11:27.520 --> 11:29.720
-[exhales]
-...leaving the viewer's imagination

11:29.800 --> 11:32.680
to picture the erotic delights
concealed beneath.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.320
I might just go and see
if I can find my calendar.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.760
Check some dates.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.800
[grumbles]

11:46.880 --> 11:51.440
[speaks slowly] Steven, I'm Duncan Clench,
producer.

11:51.520 --> 11:55.600
And, uh, this is Bob Fennison,
our director.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.480
-Hi, Steven.
-[Duncan] Something to eat?

11:58.440 --> 12:00.480
-Oh, um, there's a menu.
-[Duncan] Oh.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.160
Uh, club sandwich for me,
I think. Bob?

12:06.160 --> 12:08.160
What has Jane told you about
Calendar Girls?

12:08.240 --> 12:10.200
I presume you're familiar
with the production.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.560
It's been touring constantly since 2008.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.240
So, everything's running very smoothly
at this stage.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.560
You'll be playing the part
of the photographer.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.280
Which is an absolutely key role.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.080
I can't operate a camera.
Does that matter?

12:26.160 --> 12:29.360
Oh no, no, no, no. You won't be actually
taking any photographs.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.560
So, it's no... What, what?

12:31.640 --> 12:35.040
Um, sorry about this, Steven. [chuckles]
Be back in a moment.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.040
-[laughs] Sorry about that, Steven.
-Everything alright?

12:44.120 --> 12:46.280
Oh no, just... Well, Bob was a bit upset.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.200
He thought he should be included more
in the... in the conversation.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.680
Maybe we should include him more?

12:51.760 --> 12:53.080
Um...

12:53.160 --> 12:55.800
So, where will we be rehearsing
the play, Bob?

12:55.880 --> 13:00.360
Uh, Eastbourne. Tomorrow.
We've got a fantastic bunch of actors.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.120
-[Toast] Shit.
-Oh. Uh, sorry about this.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.960
We're going to have to go.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.120
I didn't let him answer your question
about meeting the cast

13:11.200 --> 13:13.320
and now he's furious.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.800
-You probably noticed he's... Um...
-His um...

13:16.880 --> 13:18.000
What?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.800
-His...
-He's quite shy.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.440
-Oh.
-Doesn't really like being out in company.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.120
Anyway, it's been very nice meeting you.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.560
Oh, come on!

13:27.640 --> 13:29.480
And we'll speak soon.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.400
Fucking hell.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.800
Anything could happen now.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.160
-Dead?
-Yes.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.960
-What, both of them?
-Yes.

13:45.040 --> 13:49.680
The police located their empty car
and two pairs of pajamas at Beachy Head.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.760
Good God.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.800
They're working on a theory that they went
for a dip and whilst in the water,

13:54.880 --> 13:58.360
Bob drowned Duncan
and then drowned himself.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.920
There was a really sad suicide note.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.080
What? The police went for a dip
with Bob and Duncan?

14:03.560 --> 14:05.080
-No!
-Wouldn't the police have tried

14:05.160 --> 14:07.800
to stop Bob from drowning Duncan
before Bob drowned himself?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.280
I wish you'd listen.
Just Bob and Duncan went for a dip.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.680
The police watched from the shore?

14:11.760 --> 14:13.720
The police weren't involved at this point!

14:13.800 --> 14:15.640
Ah! Maybe it was an accident.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.120
There was a suicide note!

14:17.200 --> 14:18.640
Maybe it wasn't an accident.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.560
[sighs] Bob was fiercely jealous of Duncan
and, according to the suicide note,

14:23.640 --> 14:25.600
believed that Duncan
was in love with you.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.120
Did anything happen
between you and Duncan?

14:29.200 --> 14:34.160
Did it fuck! No! We just went for a drink.
In fact, only I had a drink.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.880
They had to rush off for a train.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.360
Now the show's missing a producer and a
director. I mean, producer doesn't matter,

14:39.440 --> 14:43.480
but they really need a strong director
to break in the new cast.

14:43.560 --> 14:44.560
Yes.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.360
-Sorry?
-I'll do it. Opportunity knocks.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.280
You want to be a director?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.920
Yes, I would like to be a director.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.960
I think I'd be pretty good at it.
Don't you?

14:54.040 --> 14:57.360
Well, it's not just the technical skills,
you need people skills as well, Toast.

14:57.440 --> 15:00.720
I've got people skills
and a very good sense of humor.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.840
[laughs]

15:02.920 --> 15:06.000
If you're directing, will you be able
to take on the role of the photographer?

15:06.080 --> 15:09.120
It's a shit role anyway.
Any halfwit could do it.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.440
This is Ed Howzer-Black, and he'll be
playing the part of the photographer.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.840
Yes.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.240
Now, the first scene
we're going to have a look at is...

15:20.320 --> 15:22.360
Sorry to immediately interrupt, Toast.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.840
[whispers] Did you plan to have the ladies
undressed for this scene?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.160
This is just the rehearsal, Ed.

15:28.240 --> 15:31.800
Wouldn't it help at all? There might
be something more natural about it?

15:31.880 --> 15:33.640
You're not even in this scene.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.200
Why don't you go to your dressing room
and I'll see you at lunch?

15:36.280 --> 15:38.400
No, I think I'll stay around,
if you don't mind.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.240
I'd quite like to see
your directing style.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.840
Well, I can tell you my directing style
will be very forceful indeed.

15:45.440 --> 15:48.640
Yes, I intend to treat these people
as cattle.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.200
-Quite so, quite so.
-Yes.

15:52.360 --> 15:57.120
All right, ladies, we need the actresses
called Jennifer and Alexandra.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.480
Right.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.000
OK, this is the scene where you're both
worried about telling your husbands

16:06.080 --> 16:08.200
that you're going to do
a nude calendar shoot.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.600
Here we go. And...

16:11.120 --> 16:12.600
-Action!
-Ooh!

16:12.680 --> 16:15.640
I am slightly worried
about telling my Bert.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.920
What are his mates down the pub
going to think? I...

16:22.600 --> 16:25.120
-[laughs] Sorry, I forgot my line.
-[laughs]

16:25.200 --> 16:26.920
[laughs]

16:27.680 --> 16:29.240
You've forgotten your line?

16:30.640 --> 16:33.280
I just assumed you'd be
a bit better prepared than that.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.600
-OK, let's go again. Action!
-Ooh.

16:37.680 --> 16:41.080
I am slightly worried
about telling my Bert.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.080
What are his mates down the pub
going to think?

16:44.160 --> 16:45.960
I...

16:47.200 --> 16:49.960
-Sorry, I... I forgot my line.
-[chuckles]

16:50.040 --> 16:51.640
You did what?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.280
I forgot my line.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.400
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Show her her line.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.480
Um...

16:59.880 --> 17:02.560
And concentrate!
And don't fuck it up! Action!

17:03.640 --> 17:07.839
Ooh! I am slightly worried about
telling my Bert.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.640
What are his mates down the pub
going to think? I...

17:15.240 --> 17:16.359
Sorry, I...

17:16.440 --> 17:18.440
-I f...
-[mimics] I've forgotten my line.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.599
Are you fucking retarded?

17:20.680 --> 17:22.480
What the shit is between your ears?

17:22.560 --> 17:23.599
Can I, um...?

17:24.760 --> 17:27.359
[whispers] Sorry, she's not really
responding to your direction.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.400
-May I suggest a small piece of advice?
-What?

17:30.480 --> 17:34.240
I think you could possibly be
a little more forceful with her.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.800
-More forceful?
-Yes.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.840
A tad more aggressive.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.560
-I'd give that a go. May well work.
-OK.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.280
Jennifer, I'll be to the point.

17:49.360 --> 17:54.120
If you knacker this scene again,
I'll fucking fire you from this production

17:54.200 --> 17:57.880
and I'll replace you with an actress
who can actually act.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.960
-Action!
-[Jennifer] Ooh!

18:03.040 --> 18:07.520
[nervously] I am slightly worried about
telling my Bert.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.640
What are his mates down the pub
going to think?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.200
[tearful] I...

18:12.280 --> 18:14.840
[breathes heavily]

18:14.920 --> 18:20.120
-I... I...
-[continues breathing heavily]

18:22.720 --> 18:26.400
OK. So, Sally's just given you the news.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.960
What's needed here is a small reaction,

18:29.040 --> 18:32.920
because you don't want Sally to know
that you're upset. Right?

18:34.480 --> 18:35.520
Action!

18:35.600 --> 18:37.960
[bursts into tears]

18:38.040 --> 18:39.240
What the hell are you doing?

18:39.320 --> 18:42.040
I said a small reaction,
you fucking donut!

18:43.160 --> 18:46.160
Let's give it one more try
before I replace you with a chimpanzee.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.600
-[sobs]
-Right?

18:47.680 --> 18:50.520
Now, pull yourself together! Action!

18:50.600 --> 18:52.560
[cries loudly]

18:52.640 --> 18:55.600
No! No, no, no!

18:55.680 --> 18:57.160
[Duncan] I say!

18:57.240 --> 19:00.360
You can't speak to our actors like that!

19:00.440 --> 19:02.720
Is that Clench? Hang on!

19:02.800 --> 19:04.320
I thought you were dead.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.760
There was an incident.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.280
With Bob. He tried to drown me.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.640
-Ah.
-I drifted out to sea.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.760
But, luckily, I was washed up
just outside the theater.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.040
Why are you directing this production?

19:18.120 --> 19:20.560
I think you should leave this show!

19:20.640 --> 19:23.440
Well, screw you, sailor.
It's a shit show anyway.

19:23.920 --> 19:27.120
Bunch of middle-aged tarts
hiding their tits behind flowerpots.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.680
I can do much better than this.
Come on, Ed, we're going. Where is he?

19:32.080 --> 19:33.320
What are you doing, Ed?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.600
Just rehearsing a photography scene
with Alison here.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.680
Never mind that.
We've got to get back to London.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.840
Unlikely, Toast.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.920
-Why?
-That rail strike has gone ahead.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.400
-[moans] Oh.
-[camera clicks]

19:42.480 --> 19:44.920
Anyway, Alison has just offered
to put me up for the night.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.400
Really?

19:46.480 --> 19:50.360
I could give you a lift back, if you like.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.360
Great, where's your car?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.120
Oh, I... I... I don't have a car.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.160
What do you have?

20:00.080 --> 20:01.080
Oh.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.200
What's the problem?

20:05.280 --> 20:11.040
It's... I found the day's rehearsals
very distressing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.120
You're an extremely aggressive director.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.240
And... because I was a bit upset,

20:18.320 --> 20:22.960
I may have forgotten
to put fuel into the tank.

20:23.040 --> 20:25.160
-[engine sputters]
-[alarm sounds]

20:25.240 --> 20:27.080
Oh, for fuck's sake!

20:28.720 --> 20:30.000
[explosion]

20:31.480 --> 20:33.200
[Toast coughs]

20:41.640 --> 20:43.040
Good God.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.600
God.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.840
Sorry about earlier.

20:49.920 --> 20:54.040
I may have been a tad over the top.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.120
No hard feelings.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.120
[man] OK, stop there.
Don't move, whoever you are.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.680
-[cocks gun]
-You know this is private land.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.880
Show your face, ya bastard!

21:04.080 --> 21:07.440
Toast? What the hell are you doing here?

21:07.520 --> 21:10.520
I was in a plane
that just crashed in this wood.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.160
A likely story. Is that really the best
you can come up with, Toast?

21:14.240 --> 21:19.880
Oh! [laughs] You'll be pleased to hear
that my advert that you hate so much

21:19.960 --> 21:25.400
will be playing in over 100,000 cinemas
across the world.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.480
So your decision to walk
means zero royalties for you, fucknut!

21:31.560 --> 21:36.360
-Yeah!
-Now I see you're reduced to poaching.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.320
The last resort of the out-of-work actor.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.600
What are you talking about?

21:43.680 --> 21:46.640
What's the quickest way
back to London from here?

21:46.720 --> 21:49.520
I'd say it's to run!

21:52.400 --> 21:53.600
[gunshot]

21:54.480 --> 21:57.080
What the... Nettles? Again?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.200
Yes.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.920
Unfortunately, he's just
been in a plane crash.

22:10.640 --> 22:14.160
No, it wasn't serious.
Only one person was killed.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.200
I'm sure we can come to
a satisfactory resolution, Mr. Cockatip.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.720
Cockatip?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.280
[sighs] It's the tax man.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.200
Luckily, something's come in.
Something big.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.200
Big enough to pay off your tax bill
in one swoop.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.640
What's the product?

22:28.720 --> 22:30.720
Never mind what
the fucking product is, Toast.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.080
You have no choice in this.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.240
Here are your plane tickets.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.160
Aeroplane tickets? Where am I going?

22:38.480 --> 22:41.280
OK, boys. Let's take a break.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.640
Red Carpet cigarettes
is the number-one brand

22:44.720 --> 22:47.520
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.840
Everybody loves the silky smooth taste
of the Red Carpet.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.440
Red Carpet cigarettes.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.640
The Democratic Republic of Congo's
number-one favorite.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.880
I'll have one, please.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.040
Only ten Congolese francs a packet.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.880
Once you've smoked one, you'll want more

23:05.960 --> 23:09.360
and more and more and more.
