     all: â™ª Happy birthday
         dear Daniel â™ª

00:05.705 --> 00:10.442
   â™ª Happy birthday to you

00:10.444 --> 00:11.744
- Happy birthday, kiddo.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.312
Come on, blow out that candle.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.015
Ready?
One, two...

00:16.017 --> 00:17.049
[blows]

00:17.051 --> 00:19.284
           Good job.
             - Yay!

00:19.286 --> 00:22.121
- I can't believe
he's a year old already.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.456
- Ooh, wait.
Time for presents.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.291
             - Oh.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.261
- That one's from me.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.396
           - [laughs]

00:33.466 --> 00:35.467
 All these years you kept this?

00:35.469 --> 00:36.468
- Your mom did.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.536
She kept all your baby stuff

00:37.538 --> 00:39.204
     upstairs in the attic,

00:39.206 --> 00:42.541
 just, you know, hoping one day
    she could pass it along.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.410
     - Hank, it's perfect.
            - Yeah.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.711
Thanks, Pop.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.679
I wish Mom was here too.

00:47.681 --> 00:48.747
            - Yeah.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.417
- She would be so proud of you.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.085
That I know.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.523
        - There you go.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.224
     - Just six more months

00:59.226 --> 01:00.726
      of getting top marks
          in training,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.795
            and I'm eligible for
           signal corps officer.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.697
- I'm really, really
proud of you.

01:05.699 --> 01:09.401
             - Means a lot, Pop.
                         Thanks.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.737
- So you were in town
last month, huh?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.539
                         - Yeah.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.673
    Yeah, I was seeing a friend.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.674
                 Only had, like,
               a day and a half,

01:15.676 --> 01:17.309
            otherwise I would've
                    reached out.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.478
             - Mm.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.413
                        - Don't.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.282
- So who's this friend?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.650
  - It's my son's birthday, Pop.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.285
         I don't feel like being
             interrogated, okay?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.153
         [baby babbles]
         - There he is.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.288
- Bedtime.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.756
          - And besides, I'm not
                  a kid anymore.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.591
   I can handle my own business.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.159
- Yeah.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.264
              Hmm.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.833

01:40.835 --> 01:42.601
    <i>[indistinct radio chatter]</i>

01:42.603 --> 01:43.836
         - Hey, Sarge.

01:43.838 --> 01:45.504
    We got one dead female--

01:45.506 --> 01:46.705
      found in the trunk.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.208
   - A park district employee
     was closing the gates.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.409
      He was about to have
         the car towed

01:50.411 --> 01:51.710
     when he noticed blood
     on the rear of the car

01:51.712 --> 01:54.580
     and called the police.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.782
       - Victim's hands and feet
      are tied with barbed wire.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.650
Throat's cut.
Fingernails are gone, too.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.452
    I'm guessing she fought back
          against the assailant.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.687
         He knew there'd be DNA,

02:01.689 --> 02:02.788
          so he yanked them off.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.223
                   - Cartel hit?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.357
         - Or Russians.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.825
   They've been known to use
        barbed wire too.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.828
Car's registered to the victim.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.463
Her name's Melissa Wilds.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.198
She's 26 years old.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.600
We got an address.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.401
- All right,
call Ruzek and Olinsky.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.670
Tell them to go over there
and do a knock-and-talk.

02:18.672 --> 02:23.242

02:23.244 --> 02:25.410
       [banging on door]

02:26.846 --> 02:28.780
 - I'll call in for a warrant.

02:28.782 --> 02:32.251
              - What's going on?

02:32.253 --> 02:33.752
- We're the police.
Who are you, ma'am?

02:33.754 --> 02:34.753
       - Tricia Reynolds.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.555
     I'm Melissa's friend.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.258
    Um, I've been waiting up
      for her to get home.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.294
  This is her daughter, Tigan.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.862
     Did something happen?

02:43.864 --> 02:44.863
          [door opens]

02:44.865 --> 02:46.331
                - Where's Mommy?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.700
- Tricia, is everything okay?

02:48.702 --> 02:50.302
- Yeah, everything's fine, Mom.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.938
    - Tricia, you think your mom
could take Tigan inside, please?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.540
            - Yeah.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.841
     - When's Mommy coming home?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.177
     - She'll be home soon.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.412
      - Come on, sweetie.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.748
- We found Melissa
about an hour ago.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.716
She's been murdered.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.185
                   - Oh, my God.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.887
- Tricia, did Melissa say where
she was going tonight, or--

03:12.325 --> 03:13.525
        she had to meet someone,

03:13.527 --> 03:16.461
              so she asked me to
            watch Tigan for her.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.330
- Where's Tigan's father?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.531
            - Peter?
            - Yeah.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.768
   - Um, he--he was in the Army.

03:22.770 --> 03:26.305
     He died, um, in an accident
                      last year.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.573
                       - [sighs]

03:27.575 --> 03:28.807
          All right, we're gonna
           need you to come down

03:28.809 --> 03:31.543
to district,
just answer a few questions--

03:31.545 --> 03:33.879
call Tigan's next of kin.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.316
            - But who would want
                    to hurt her?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.851
- That's what we're
gonna find out.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.854
          <i>[solemn music]</i>

03:42.856 --> 03:49.861
               <i>â™ª </i>

03:49.863 --> 03:58.503
             - Sir.
           Commander.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.806
 - Sergeant, please have a seat.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.241
         [door closes]
     - This meeting's like

04:02.243 --> 04:03.942
          a coin flip.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.011
          Am I getting
   a department commendation

04:06.013 --> 04:07.980
      or the firing squad?

04:07.982 --> 04:09.548
    - Sergeant, as you know,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.650
    the department is under
       intense scrutiny.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.486
  Charges of racial profiling,
    excessive use of force,

04:14.488 --> 04:15.988
       deadly shootings--

04:15.990 --> 04:18.589
    public trust and morale
    are at critical points.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.659
- The new superintendent's
trying to fix that.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.694
            - Good.
  - Implementing new programs,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.596
new strategies--

04:24.598 --> 04:28.000
strategies that might not fit
with your "old school" approach.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.702
  - Well, I'm not a stats guy,
  but I'm pretty sure my unit

04:30.704 --> 04:33.839
   has the highest clear rate
of any organized crime division.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.608
        - And we know the credit
    for that goes mostly to you.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.843
     - It's a team effort.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.778
- Which brings us to why
you're here.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.447
We're promoting you
to lieutenant.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.616
                 - I didn't take
          the lieutenant's exam.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.852
- It's a meritorious promotion.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.787
        - You're one of the most
           respected supervisors

04:48.789 --> 04:49.955
                   in the field.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.423
      Instead of a six-man unit,

04:51.425 --> 04:52.991
      you'll be in charge of 50.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.794
Instill your years of knowledge
           onto them.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.531
   There's also a substantial
        salary increase.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.868
   - So all those times you guys
       tried to put paper on me,

05:02.870 --> 05:05.337
              take away my star,
           question my methods--

05:05.339 --> 05:07.906
             it's all forgotten?

05:07.908 --> 05:11.743
     Why don't we just call this
                     what it is?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.046
         Part of this new policy
        is taking proactive cops

05:14.048 --> 05:15.514
                 off the street.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.449
- I think "proactive" is putting
          it politely, Sergeant.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.584
       how you see this,

05:19.586 --> 05:23.455
     we strongly recommend
        that you accept.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.991
      - May I please be excused?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.959
- You have 48 hours
to give us your answer.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.361
    - Thank you, Commander.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.395
           Gentlemen.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.599
- Melissa Wilds.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.101
Her husband was
an Army private--

05:36.103 --> 05:38.570
killed in a training exercise
last year at Fort Bragg,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.739
along with three others,
when their chopper went down.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.574
    - She had an associate's
         from Roosevelt

05:42.576 --> 05:44.876
 and worked as a paralegal for
 the law firm Sawyer & Sawyer.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.445
               - Yeah, I've seen
              those commercials.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.347
       They're just high-profile
              ambulance chasers.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.514
      - Bigger than that.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.783
      They do seven-figure
     class action lawsuits

05:51.785 --> 05:54.486
against pharmaceutical companies
   or schools with asbestos.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.455
- Yo, except for a few
parking tickets,

05:56.457 --> 05:57.889
Melissa has zero priors.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.691
She's a working, widowed mom,

05:59.693 --> 06:01.860
 so the more I'm digging here,
     I can't see any reason

06:01.862 --> 06:05.097
    why she'd be associated
 with cartels or any Russians.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.598
- Melissa.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.834
     This girl was tortured
       with barbed wire.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.002
    That means the killer either
      wanted something from her,

06:11.004 --> 06:12.504
             or it was personal.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.906
So I want to know where she was
      before we found her,

06:14.908 --> 06:17.609
              who she was with--
  if she was seeing someone new.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.911
           Hey, look who's here.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.680
       - Oh, there he is.
          - Hey, hey.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.648
        - Last day, huh?
       - Yep, this is it.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.750
  Just clearing out my locker.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.118
     - Gonna miss you, man.
           - You too.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.887
   Here, I know you never passed
       a mirror you didn't like.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.523
- Yeah, you know, I got to check
my fade out around the clock.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.724
I appreciate that, bro.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.892
           [laughter]

06:33.894 --> 06:35.660
        - Here, for you.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.129
 Just in case they ever let you
      loose in the street.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.930
          - [laughing]
        Are you kidding?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.899
 Oh, I'm definitely using this

06:40.901 --> 06:42.033
on these bozos up here.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.535
 - This is--this is a bad idea.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.671
           Hey, man.
             - Hi.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.740
- Sorry to see you go, Sean.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.175
- Hey, if the job don't want me,

06:50.177 --> 06:51.777
   then I don't want the job.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.044
- Do yourself a favor.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.781
Just leave that at the doorstep
when you walk out of here.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.550
You served this city proudly.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.751
Just carry that with you.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.153
- Yeah.
Thanks, Sergeant.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.756
             Adam.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.658
                I know it wasn't
              pretty between us.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.862

Never complained about the hours
