so you don't keep sneaking up on me.

02:20.726 --> 02:22.561
What do you look at in the ocean?

02:24.062 --> 02:25.272
Oh, nothing.

02:26.565 --> 02:29.109
You spend a lot of time staring at "nothing."

02:31.236 --> 02:32.571
Okay, I take it back.

02:33.405 --> 02:36.908
It's something, it's the big "out there."

02:38.493 --> 02:42.748
The ocean is powerful, but mostly it's vast.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.127
It's full of life, mystery.

beneath the surface?

- Monsters? Maybe.

02:56.678 --> 02:59.097
Dreams, sunken treasure.

03:01.266 --> 03:04.436

It's gonna be fine.

03:14.112 --> 03:15.947
They all think I choked that girl.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.784
Yeah, but you know that you didn't
and I know that you didn't.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.453
And it's good enough for me.
It should be good enough for you.

03:21.536 --> 03:24.289
It's gonna be good enough
for everyone else, too.

03:27.042 --> 03:28.460
What's our mantra?

03:29.461 --> 03:30.629
Every day, we're gonna be...

03:43.517 --> 03:44.559
Okay.

03:47.229 --> 03:50.482
I don't have time for this this morning.
Please put your shirt on.

03:50.816 --> 03:52.567
Why did we move here?

03:55.320 --> 03:57.155
- Why?
- That's enough.

04:01.535 --> 04:03.245
You can finish that in the car. Let's go.

04:05.705 --> 04:08.083
I don't mean to do your job
but it begs the question,

04:08.333 --> 04:09.751
"Is she running from something?"

04:09.835 --> 04:11.962

No, this makes us look like cowards.

he might consider legal...</i>

04:27.853 --> 04:29.896

the precedent that you'd be setting?

04:30.021 --> 04:31.898
<i>- I 'd have to solicit the city council...
- Don't yell at me.</i>

You know what?

04:34.443 --> 04:37.779
I'm a lady and I've never said
this to anybody ever in my entire life,

04:37.863 --> 04:38.905
but I'm going to say it to you.

04:39.030 --> 04:40.949
You can go fuck yourself on the head.

04:46.079 --> 04:47.539
Right on the head?

04:48.039 --> 04:49.791
I'm sorry,
but he's trying to shut down Avenue Q.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.460
He says it's too controversial.

04:51.543 --> 04:53.545
What does he want to replace it with?

05:08.727 --> 05:10.061
I do, actually.

05:11.897 --> 05:15.233

05:31.458 --> 05:33.043
The idea of a bully in the class...

05:33.126 --> 05:35.670
CELESTE: I don't think he's a bully,
but you're probably right.

05:35.754 --> 05:37.672
We should err on the side of safety.

05:40.592 --> 05:41.593
Hmm.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.846
Wish I didn't have to fly out tonight.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.561
I was thinking,
when you get back from Vienna,

05:51.645 --> 05:53.605
maybe we could see another counselor.

05:57.817 --> 05:59.986

in kindergarten anymore,

10:42.936 --> 10:44.562

10:45.438 --> 10:49.442
that the transition to first grade
is not always easy.

10:50.109 --> 10:53.738
But with Harry here, you won't even
notice it. I promise.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.074
And the best part.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.618
You will all have your turn

Well, I'm going to start off our day
by passing Harry around,

11:08.127 --> 11:10.964
so you can all greet him with a hug. Okay?

11:11.464 --> 11:12.924
Here you go, Billy.

11:13.633 --> 11:14.717
Yes.

11:14.884 --> 11:16.719

Why, yes. Harry loves hugs.

on their first day of school.

And then I don't even get
to go in the building.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.174
I understand, but I just...

11:55.300 --> 11:57.176
And for you to just dismiss
my being upset about it?

11:57.594 --> 11:59.137
I didn't dismiss anything.

- I just don't want to get blamed...
- Yeah, you know what I think?

I think you didn't want me
to be there for Orientation.

12:07.645 --> 12:08.688

14:46.012 --> 14:47.805
No, I'm doing an interview here!

14:47.930 --> 14:51.309
MADELINE: Turns out, it's actually harder
to have a part-time job versus a full-time job

14:51.434 --> 14:54.771
because, in addition to doing all that work,
you're out there scouring for another job.

14:54.854 --> 14:58.691
JANE: Are you looking for another job'?
MADELINE: I only do 2O hours a week, max.

14:58.816 --> 15:01.444
Between you and I, I try and maintain
my full-time mommy status,

15:01.527 --> 15:04.363
so I can lord over women like Renata
and the other career mommies.

15:04.489 --> 15:05.490
(LAUGHS)

15:05.948 --> 15:08.451
Oh, there they are. Our future world leaders.

15:08.534 --> 15:09.786
JANE: Do you see mine?
MADELINE: Yep.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.955
- Chloe!
- Ma'am, please.

15:13.498 --> 15:15.374
What, I can't call for my own daughter?

15:15.666 --> 15:17.168
Please re-board the vehicle, ma'am.

15:18.503 --> 15:20.630
- CHLOE: You causing trouble, woman?
- Get in the car.

15:20.713 --> 15:22.965
And don't ever blow your whistle at me again.

15:23.049 --> 15:24.634
You're new here, I'm not.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.386
ZIGGY: Mommy!
JANE: Hi, baby!

15:28.221 --> 15:32.642
- So, how was your first day?
- Fine. We got to meet Harry the Hippo.

15:33.351 --> 15:35.186
JANE: And, Zig?
ZIGGY: Good.

15:35.311 --> 15:37.146
- JANE: Yeah?
- Teacher's nice.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.357
She is? Oh, that's amazing!

15:39.649 --> 15:41.859
- That's so great.
- What's that?

15:45.696 --> 15:48.407
Oh, Amabella's having a party. That's sweet.

15:49.575 --> 15:51.035
I didn't get invited.

15:52.745 --> 15:55.540
Honey, you don't know her very well.
You don't know her at all.

15:55.748 --> 15:57.041
MADELINE: This is
about that stupid accusation.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.251
It's fine.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.880
(INAUDIBLE)

16:03.714 --> 16:05.883
Okay, what are we listening to?

16:06.384 --> 16:09.387
Feces is never terribly far
from Madeline's fan.

16:09.512 --> 16:11.973
And the whole party thing created a vortex.

16:12.056 --> 16:13.516
Outrageous is what it is.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.227
For the whole class to be invited
with the exception of Ziggy?

16:16.352 --> 16:19.522
- I mean, come on.
- Is he the kid who...

16:20.439 --> 16:21.941
- Will you please...
- What?

16:22.441 --> 16:23.568
Chloe.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.904
- Abby, come on.
- MADELINE: This is so Renata.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.781
On the very first day of school?

16:29.615 --> 16:33.327
Well, if she's convinced that this Ziggy
poses a threat to her daughter's safety,

16:33.411 --> 16:34.787
of course he's not going to get invited.

16:34.912 --> 16:35.955
I'm just saying

16:36.080 --> 16:38.791
that distributing the invitations
in the classroom,

16:38.916 --> 16:40.042
to the exception of one person,

16:40.126 --> 16:41.377
I mean, it's just unacceptable.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.296
Thank you, honey. This looks delicious.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.465
Abby, are you dating the fridge?

16:48.759 --> 16:52.805
Mmm. Chloe. I set up a standing play-date
with you and Ziggy on Thursdays.

16:53.139 --> 16:54.265
Cool.

16:55.892 --> 16:58.978
- Are we sure that's a good idea?
- Why would it not be?

16:59.562 --> 17:01.814
We don't know for a fact that he's innocent.

17:02.815 --> 17:06.944
Maybe the benefit of the doubt
should run to Chloe's favor instead of Ziggy.

17:07.278 --> 17:10.114
Are you suggesting I might be
putting my daughter in harm's way?

17:10.239 --> 17:11.949
Oh, you mean our daughter?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.829
Chloe, I don't know why you didn't text me
or call me when the snub happened.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.915
I might have been able to intervene.

17:18.998 --> 17:20.249
How would she call you?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.713
She has a phone in her doll.

17:25.796 --> 17:29.800
Don't start with me right now.
It's just for emergencies.

17:30.593 --> 17:32.803
ABIGAIL: You really shouldn't encourage her
to play with dolls.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.805
And why is that exactly?

17:35.848 --> 17:37.516
It's a little 1960s.

17:37.934 --> 17:40.186
Not to mention sexist. Is it a Barbie doll?

17:40.311 --> 17:42.772
You can't fit a phone in a Barbie, dummy.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.023
MADELINEI Chloe.

17:44.649 --> 17:46.442
Barbies aren't allowed anyways.

17:46.525 --> 17:49.695
Sylvie Baker's gave Joey Proccacini a boner.

17:51.364 --> 17:54.116
Okay. You know, Abigail,

17:54.200 --> 17:58.037
I am super impressed with your emerging
social conscience, I really am.

17:58.621 --> 18:01.707
Shall we leave it at that
or is now the time to pile on Bonnie?

18:24.522 --> 18:27.525
I just have a very low tolerance for injustice,

18:27.817 --> 18:30.528
which is exactly what's going on
with Ziggy and his mom.

18:32.571 --> 18:35.032
You fled the table
when Abby brought up Bonnie.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.661
I'd ask you what's the deal with Bonnie,

18:38.744 --> 18:41.580
but I think we both know
it's really about Nathan.

18:42.415 --> 18:44.417
- That is not true.
- That is true.

18:44.542 --> 18:47.336
Ed, I shouldn't have to
constantly run into the guy.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.463
Monterey has 30,000 people

18:49.547 --> 18:52.967
and I can't go to a goddamn yoga class
without seeing him and her?

18:53.050 --> 18:55.594
And yoga? Give me a break.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.806
When I was married to him,
he wouldn't so much as go for a walk,

18:58.889 --> 19:01.225
and when he finally did, he never came back.

19:01.559 --> 19:03.352
Remember that big fight I promised?

19:03.436 --> 19:05.104
- Yeah.
- I think now would be a good time.

19:05.229 --> 19:06.272
Why?

19:07.398 --> 19:09.442
Is Nathan the one?

19:09.734 --> 19:10.735
What?

19:10.901 --> 19:12.069
- What do you mean...
- The one.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.779
For every person, there's "the one."

19:15.197 --> 19:17.575
Case in point, you're my one.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.410
- Well, you are my...
- Shut up!

19:20.786 --> 19:24.206
But for you, he's the one
you fell irreparably in love with,

19:24.290 --> 19:26.334
who irreparably broke your heart.

19:26.417 --> 19:29.253
Who you apparently can't get over,
15 years later.

19:29.420 --> 19:30.463
(SCOFFS)

19:31.422 --> 19:32.840
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

19:32.923 --> 19:35.926
I'm never out of my mind.
I don't get to be crazy, Madeline.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.429
I'm stable, I'm grounded.

19:39.096 --> 19:41.223
Good old steady Eddie, that's me.

19:42.558 --> 19:43.601
Wow.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.645
Where is this coming from?

19:47.480 --> 19:51.150
It's coming from the fact that
you don't really seem to adore me,

19:51.275 --> 19:53.569
that you're rarely interested in having sex.

19:53.652 --> 19:57.782
But, specifically today, it's coming
from your constant carrying on

19:57.907 --> 20:01.118
about Nathan and his seemingly perfect life.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.497
Which tells me that
you're far from satisfied with your own.

20:04.622 --> 20:06.332
And I'm fucking sick of it.

20:09.335 --> 20:12.797
Look, I may not be
the good-looking adventure ride, okay?

20:12.922 --> 20:17.510
But there is something to be said
for being there, for being truthful,

20:17.635 --> 20:20.513
for being somebody
you can steadfastly count on.

20:23.933 --> 20:27.186
I will not be anybody's runner-up.
You need to hear that.

20:28.187 --> 20:30.481
Scratch the surface of any Jimmy Stewart...

20:32.149 --> 20:33.359
<i>Charlie Manson.</i>

20:36.195 --> 20:37.279
<i>JOSH: No.</i>

20:47.456 --> 20:50.042
- You okay?
- He's scared.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.628
Scared?

20:53.671 --> 20:54.880
What are you scared of?

20:55.673 --> 20:56.674
No, I'm not.

20:58.217 --> 21:00.344
- He is.
- Oh, he is.

21:01.887 --> 21:02.972
(SIGHS)

21:10.229 --> 21:11.522
How's Ziggy doing?

21:13.190 --> 21:14.191
Good.

21:15.985 --> 21:18.821
Do you think he was the one
who hurt Amabella the other day?

21:18.904 --> 21:21.031
- BOTH: No.
- He's really nice.

21:21.365 --> 21:22.741
Could he come over?

21:25.202 --> 21:26.912
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Okay.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.582
Just have to ask your dad.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.711
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

21:37.173 --> 21:38.841
Hey, wanna meet me at Side Door?

21:38.924 --> 21:41.760
- I need to swap out my family for some vodka.
-(CELESTE LAUGHS)

21:42.011 --> 21:44.346
<i>-ls</i> your nanny <i>there?
- Yeah, she is, actually.</i>

21:44.430 --> 21:45.890
Great. I'll see you then.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.895
I think they both had drinking problems. I do.

21:51.228 --> 21:55.107
Well, I'm happy to let you post it,
but nobody really reads these flyers.

21:55.566 --> 21:57.943
And if you want to get work these days,
you need a website.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.529
- I know, it's just so expensive.
-It's not as much as you think.

22:00.613 --> 22:03.908
Madeline's husband, Ed, is in web design.
He could help you put something together.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.576
Maybe.

22:05.784 --> 22:08.746
I already have an accountant,
but otherwise, I would...

22:09.788 --> 22:11.457
-it's all good.
- No, I would.

22:11.582 --> 22:15.211
- Do you have any clients?
- Yeah, a few portables still from Santa Cruz.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.922
Can I ask what brought you here?

22:18.047 --> 22:20.424
The schools are great,
to build a better life for her son.

22:20.549 --> 22:21.884
That's all you'll get.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.386
Whoa. Yes, Ziggy.

22:24.470 --> 22:26.931
I did come here with dreams of a certain life.
You are right.

22:28.766 --> 22:30.142
Hopefully a better one.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.437
Mom.

22:34.605 --> 22:35.940
JANE: The chocolate one?

22:37.233 --> 22:38.484
Okay, but I'm eating some.

22:48.661 --> 22:53.749
<i>We're looking at the victim's relationships
with every parent who attended Trivia Night.</i>

22:59.463 --> 23:02.758
"ls Nathan the one?" (SCOFFS) Of course not!

23:03.425 --> 23:05.761
MADELINE: That he doubts my love for him?

23:06.303 --> 23:08.013
And Ed's not a neurotic guy.

23:08.973 --> 23:13.310
So, maybe it is me, maybe I'm just lousy
at conveying how much I...

23:13.435 --> 23:14.520
I don't know.

23:14.645 --> 23:16.981
You once said that you two
don't have sex very often.

23:17.106 --> 23:22.319
That's because I'm exhausted all the time
from school, or the kids, or the play.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.948
What was Nathan like in bed?

23:26.782 --> 23:28.284
I don't want to talk about Nathan.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.535
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:29.660 --> 23:30.995
But we are talking about Nathan.

23:31.120 --> 23:33.622
- No, we were talking about Ed.
- Okay.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.374
Okay, what?

23:35.499 --> 23:39.670
Is it possible that you had a little more
passion for Nathan than you have for Ed?

23:39.795 --> 23:42.339
And maybe he senses that?

23:42.840 --> 23:46.510
Men can be a little more intuitive
than we give them credit for, you know.

23:47.636 --> 23:49.805
Have you thought about seeing a counselor?

23:50.681 --> 23:53.350
My God, we don't need a counselor.
Couples fight.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.145
You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight?

23:56.228 --> 23:57.354
Yeah, we do.

23:58.981 --> 23:59.982
Sometimes.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.109
And then do you run off
to therapy afterwards?

24:02.192 --> 24:03.235
(LAUGHS)

24:05.321 --> 24:07.990
More often than not, we end up having sex.

24:10.367 --> 24:11.410
Really?

24:12.036 --> 24:13.078
Yes.

24:13.495 --> 24:17.833
Starts with anger and... It's complicated.

24:21.253 --> 24:25.591
Sometimes I think that he likes to fight
because it leads to sex.

24:25.883 --> 24:26.884
(CHUCKLES)

24:29.178 --> 24:31.013
Sometimes I think I like it, too.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.767
How often does this happen?

24:36.060 --> 24:38.270
Happens enough.

24:40.564 --> 24:44.109
I have to say, Celeste,
that sounds a little bit twisted.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.446
But kind of great, too.

24:47.571 --> 24:48.614
(LAUGHS)

24:49.073 --> 24:51.116
So the sex that you have, is it like...

24:51.700 --> 24:52.868
Hello!

24:53.577 --> 24:57.122
(LAUGHING)
Hi, Celeste. Madeline. How are you?

24:57.247 --> 24:59.375
I was over there with my girlfriends
getting our drink on,

24:59.458 --> 25:00.918
and I saw you two.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.961
- Do you have a second?
- Sure.

25:03.712 --> 25:08.050
RENATA: Did you know that they're thinking
about closing down the local VA hospital?

25:08.217 --> 25:12.304
It means that vets are having to drive
all the way to Sacramento for their services,

25:12.638 --> 25:15.099
which is so upsetting.

25:15.599 --> 25:18.644
I've really dedicated a lot of my life to vets,

25:18.769 --> 25:20.270
and specifically PTSD,

25:20.396 --> 25:24.316
so I'm gonna hold
a little fundraising dinner party

25:24.441 --> 25:26.944
and help defray costs
and keep the facility open.

25:27.069 --> 25:29.363
It would be so great
if you and Perry could come.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.489
Yeah, sure.

25:30.614 --> 25:34.743
And you and Ed, of course, would be so nice.

25:34.827 --> 25:37.579
- You're such a kind person, Renata.
- Thank you.

25:37.663 --> 25:41.792
And, you know, it was very sweet of you
to invite Chloe to Amabella's birthday party.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.086
Of course. Of course.

25:44.169 --> 25:47.798
However, it wasn't very sweet
to single out and exclude little Ziggy.

25:47.923 --> 25:49.133
Really?

25:49.425 --> 25:50.467
Do you think it would be okay

25:50.592 --> 25:52.803
for little Amabella to be strangled
at her birthday party?

25:52.928 --> 25:53.929
I don't think so.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.265
If Ziggy doesn't go, then Chloe's not going.

25:57.099 --> 26:00.853
Okay, I don't think this is the right time
to be... Let's just... Thank you.

26:00.978 --> 26:03.021
And if Chloe's out,
then the entire brigade will follow.

26:03.147 --> 26:05.149
- She's basically the pied piper.
- What?

26:09.486 --> 26:10.946
I like you, Madeline.

26:11.488 --> 26:15.492
And I actually admire you for
sticking up for your unapologetic friend.

26:16.702 --> 26:20.456
But if I can offer something
as objectively as I possibly can...

26:21.540 --> 26:24.376
Do not fuck with my daughter's birthday.

26:24.668 --> 26:28.213
<i>GABRIELLE: I was in that bar,
and I distinctly saw Madeline...</i>

26:28.464 --> 26:30.174
...glance at a steak knife.

26:30.340 --> 26:31.508
MADELINEI What a cunt!

26:31.675 --> 26:34.178
- Excuse me?
- Why don't you get fucked!

26:34.344 --> 26:35.512
RENATAI WOW.

26:36.013 --> 26:37.306
The war is on.

26:38.849 --> 26:40.684
ED: This really isn't fair to Chloe.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.105
Excuse me?

26:45.189 --> 26:48.233
Last year Amabella
had a jumping castle and a magician.

26:48.358 --> 26:50.152
This year only figures to be better.

26:50.736 --> 26:51.945
Oh, please.

26:52.029 --> 26:54.531
And for you to summarily say she can't go,

26:55.073 --> 26:58.660
and use her as a tool
to get other kids not to go?

26:58.869 --> 27:00.329
MADELINE: I am not doing that.

27:00.496 --> 27:03.749
One minute it's Nathan or Bonnie,
now Renata,

27:03.874 --> 27:06.418
not to mention the parking monitor,
the girls in the car...

27:06.543 --> 27:08.879
I can't even keep track
of all the fights you start.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.506
Somebody needs to invent an app.

27:10.589 --> 27:12.841
Well, maybe you could have my back
on some of them.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.552
What is it about this Jane?

27:15.677 --> 27:18.555
What is she, long lost sister or something?

27:18.889 --> 27:21.391
- Just a cause in lieu of...
- In lieu of what?

27:21.683 --> 27:23.852
In lieu of a life?
Is that what you were gonna say?

27:24.686 --> 27:28.273
And Jane's a single mom. Do you need
an app to put two and two together?

27:29.066 --> 27:31.401
When Abigail was a little baby,
Nathan was not around.

27:31.527 --> 27:35.113
And I was a single mom, Ed.
And I'm still angry about it.

27:35.906 --> 27:39.284
It's not my love for Nathan
that lingers after 15 years,

27:39.409 --> 27:40.869
it's my resentment.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.039
There's a big difference!

27:44.122 --> 27:45.207
(SPITS)

27:48.544 --> 27:49.753
Did you hear me?

28:33.338 --> 28:34.423
Oh.

28:37.259 --> 28:38.802
They arrived just after you left.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.180
Double the price, I think,
for nighttime deliveries.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.348
Wow.

28:52.482 --> 28:57.154
On a less positive note
I believe I've failed you miserably.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.878
(SHRIEKING AND GIGGLING)

29:13.712 --> 29:16.965
I thought Harry was just
a stupid stuffed animal for babies.

29:17.507 --> 29:19.343
He is.

29:20.802 --> 29:21.845
- Mom?
-(LAUGHING)

29:21.970 --> 29:24.181
- Can we sleep with you tonight?
- Again?

29:25.682 --> 29:26.725
Mmm.

29:27.017 --> 29:30.520
Well, as long as Harry doesn't snore.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.524
I've heard it's a problem,
a real problem with hippos.

29:34.650 --> 29:37.527
- Daddy snores.
- Yes, Daddy does snore.

29:39.321 --> 29:40.489
(MOCK SNORES LOUDLY)

29:40.697 --> 29:42.199
-(LAUGHING)
- No, like this.

29:42.407 --> 29:43.492
Like this. (MOCK SNORES LOUDLY)

29:43.700 --> 29:45.869
(ALL MOCK SNORE LOUDLY)

29:47.871 --> 29:48.956
(LAUGHING)

29:49.039 --> 29:50.707
I wish Daddy were here.

29:52.376 --> 29:55.003
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

29:57.506 --> 30:00.592
But the four of us all together,
we're gonna be fine.

30:00.842 --> 30:01.885
- Mmm.
- Hmm?

30:04.721 --> 30:06.682
Oh! What happened?

30:08.058 --> 30:09.351
Harry is missing a leg!

30:09.434 --> 30:10.769
JOSH: It was Max.
MAX: it was Josh.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.229
JOSH: It was Max.
MAX: it was Josh.

30:13.397 --> 30:16.358
JANE: You know, that's really...
That's super sweet of you, Madeline,

30:16.441 --> 30:20.070
and as much as I appreciate that,
I feel like, you know, if...

30:20.195 --> 30:22.739
If this birthday party is ruined because of him,

30:22.864 --> 30:24.741
then it's only going
to make things worse for him.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.744
Sweetheart, everyone just assumes
around here I'm the root cause of everything.

30:27.869 --> 30:28.912
Don't worry.

30:29.287 --> 30:32.541
JANE: <i>I 'd prefer it if you just let
Chloe go to the birthday party...</i>

30:32.624 --> 30:33.875
Let me call you right back.

30:35.085 --> 30:36.420
Chloe, get in the car.

30:39.131 --> 30:42.092
- Chloe, get in the car right now.
- What?

30:42.926 --> 30:44.219
I need to talk to you.

30:47.597 --> 30:48.598
Now.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.395
(SIGHS)

30:57.399 --> 31:00.027
- I'm not having sex, I promise you.
- What are those pills?

31:00.110 --> 31:02.279
They're just for
in case, you know, the day comes.

31:02.404 --> 31:05.032
Not that it's coming anytime soon,
but I just have 'em...

31:05.115 --> 31:06.950
You are 16 years old.
Where did you get them?

31:07.075 --> 31:09.453
- From a doctor.
- Dr. Ennis?

31:10.120 --> 31:11.788
She wrote you a prescription
without calling me?

31:11.913 --> 31:13.665
Not her. I went to Planned Parenthood.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.711
Please don't make a big deal about this.
I'm not sexually active, okay?

31:17.794 --> 31:19.129
Who took you there?

31:19.629 --> 31:21.506
- What?
- Planned Parenthood.

31:21.631 --> 31:23.633
Did you take a car, an Uber?
Did somebody give you a ride?

31:23.759 --> 31:25.802
It's in Seaside. How did you get there?

31:33.518 --> 31:34.644
Here you are.

31:34.811 --> 31:36.813
- Love you, Mama. Bye.
- Love you. Bye.

31:36.938 --> 31:37.939
Have a good day.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.316
- Stay in the car.
-(BLOWS WHISTLE) Ma'am!

31:39.441 --> 31:41.318
I'm just gonna be a minute.

31:41.443 --> 31:42.486
Bonnie?

31:42.611 --> 31:44.154
Bonnie, can I talk to you forjust a second?

31:44.279 --> 31:45.614
- Of course.
- Couple of things.

31:45.989 --> 31:48.450
First of all, I'm happy that
Abigail has bonded with your mother.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.703
Thrilled about the communal
potato-peeling thing.

31:51.953 --> 31:54.623
But when it comes to my daughter's
social recreational life,

31:54.956 --> 31:56.291
particularly as it concerns to medications

31:56.374 --> 31:59.503
that will permanently affect
her reproductive organs,

31:59.628 --> 32:01.671
will you just kick
that little can of worms over to me?

32:01.797 --> 32:03.090
- Do you understand?
- I do.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.383
And should Skye come to me
10 years down the road

32:05.509 --> 32:07.344
and ask for a little lift to Planned Parenthood,

32:07.469 --> 32:09.596
I would give you that courtesy call first.

32:09.679 --> 32:10.722
Thanks.

32:13.225 --> 32:15.477
- Ma'am!
- MADELINE: I'm dropping off my kid!

32:15.977 --> 32:17.312
Come on, Chloe.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.191
My daughter. It's my daughter.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.568
Next time you wanna do something like that,

32:23.693 --> 32:25.153
why don't I take your daughter?

32:25.987 --> 32:29.407
Your daughter.
Do whatever you want to her. (SCOFFS)

32:29.866 --> 32:31.243
Are you fucking kidding me?

32:32.661 --> 32:33.703
MADELINE: <i>And what I don't understand is</i>

32:33.829 --> 32:35.705
<i>why my own daughter
wouldn't come to me first.</i>

32:35.831 --> 32:37.874
JANE: <i>I couldn't talk to my mom
about birth control.</i>

32:37.999 --> 32:39.000
MADELINEI <i>Really?</i>

32:39.084 --> 32:40.877
If I were you, I would just let it go.

32:41.837 --> 32:44.089
I would. With Bonnie, Abigail. I'd ride it out.

32:44.214 --> 32:47.134
I love my grudges.
I tend to them like little pets.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.553
- All right, I'm just saying.
- I do the same thing.

32:49.678 --> 32:51.388
I'm not into forgiveness either.

32:51.513 --> 32:52.931
Really? Who do you not forgive?

32:53.890 --> 32:55.725
No one. Just in general, you know?

32:56.059 --> 32:57.519
"Never forgive. Never forget."

32:58.687 --> 33:00.397
That sure sounds like a motto to live by.

33:01.231 --> 33:03.275
- Good morning, Maddie. How are you?
- Hi, Tom.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.735
- Everyone's making me angry.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

33:05.861 --> 33:08.071
- Except for you. And you guys.
- And me.

33:08.780 --> 33:09.865
Oh.

33:09.948 --> 33:12.409
Marv Hermann,
he runs the muffler shop on Kentner,

33:12.534 --> 33:14.411
and I hear that he's in need of
some bookkeeping assistance.

33:15.453 --> 33:16.538
Great. Thank you!

33:16.621 --> 33:19.708
And actually maybe some legal assistance,
too, if the zoning board stays on him.

33:19.791 --> 33:20.834
I'm retired.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.252
Unless you're defending
the First Amendment.

33:22.377 --> 33:23.420
You never give up.

33:23.545 --> 33:24.713
Oh, I heard about this.

33:25.589 --> 33:26.798
Ridiculous.
- I mean, I can't.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.049
- Where are we living, girls?
-It is ridiculous.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.718
It's obscene. What can I get you, Maddie?

33:29.801 --> 33:31.928
I'll have a cappuccino. And a shot.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.222
I'm sure you have one back there.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.808
- I'll see what I can do. (LAUGHS)
- Thank you.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.852
Yeah, I guess Shakespeare got it wrong.

33:38.935 --> 33:40.687
"The play's the thing, unless it has puppets."

33:40.770 --> 33:42.898
Exactly! See? He understands me.

33:43.982 --> 33:45.775
Unfortunately, gay.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.110
- Really?
- Hmm.

33:47.235 --> 33:48.904
- Come on.
- Yes!

33:48.987 --> 33:50.530
- You're sure about that?
- All the best ones are.

33:57.913 --> 33:59.247
- ED: Hey.
- Hey,Ed.

33:59.331 --> 34:00.665
- What's up?
- Hey, man.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.169
Love the look. Especially the mirror, it's...

34:04.920 --> 34:06.671
You gotta respect a man
who has his own back.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.465
Well. Standard stuff.

34:10.091 --> 34:12.469
- Yeah. How's the computer business going?
- Oh, great.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.971
Kinda like landscaping, I guess.

34:15.764 --> 34:19.266
- Growth business.
-(LAUGHS) That's clever.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.688
- Um... Hey, Thanks for meeting me.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:23.813 --> 34:27.192
Yeah. I just wanted to discuss
this whole thing with, like...

34:27.943 --> 34:30.070
That happened with Bonnie and Abby.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.196
Sure.

34:32.197 --> 34:35.367
You know, as far as I can tell,
there was no undue influence or interference.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.744
Like, Abby asked Bonnie some questions
about Planned Parenthood,

34:37.827 --> 34:38.870
Bonnie answered them,

34:38.995 --> 34:40.830
Abby then asked Bonnie to drive her there.

34:41.498 --> 34:44.833
There was no parental usurping of any kind,
I promise you that.

34:45.668 --> 34:47.629
But I can discuss that whole thing
with Maddie,

34:48.004 --> 34:50.005
but what I wanted to take up with you is,

34:50.715 --> 34:55.303
I think you can probably appreciate that it's
a bit of a delicate balancing act with my ex.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.850
So, you know, I kind of expect her
to be rough on me,

35:00.976 --> 35:04.020
but I think it's...
Like, you can't punish Bonnie.

35:05.647 --> 35:09.818
Well, I believe she's being nice to Bonnie,
or at least trying, under the circumstances.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.072
What circumstances would those be?

35:14.572 --> 35:17.158
Nathan, come on.
It was pretty tough when you left.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.704
What? That was like 15 years ago.

35:22.914 --> 35:28.128
It's difficult for Madeline to see you
at every school function, so involved,

35:28.211 --> 35:31.006
when you weren't there for Abigail.

35:31.589 --> 35:33.842
It's difficult to run into you at yoga
when you never...

35:34.718 --> 35:36.636
You know what?
Maybe I'm talking out of turn here.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.596
No. I was young. You know?

35:39.723 --> 35:41.391
And maybe a bit of a shit.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.061
And I made some real mistakes
with both Maddie and Abby.

35:45.729 --> 35:48.273
But should I be required to make
the same mistakes with Bonnie and Skye?

35:48.398 --> 35:52.944
No. But, you know, it doesn't hurt to be
mindful of other people's feelings sometimes.

35:53.361 --> 35:55.405
Oh, yeah, yeah. Mr. Sensitive.

35:56.531 --> 35:57.615
Excuse me?

35:57.866 --> 36:00.076
No, actually, I meant that as a compliment.

36:01.578 --> 36:04.372
You're kind of like today's
standard bearer for the evolved man.

36:04.748 --> 36:06.249
Like you work at home, and you...

36:06.374 --> 36:08.710
And you do almost 50-50 of the child care.
You even cook.

36:08.793 --> 36:12.839
So you're the guy who likes to
fish and hunt, and I'm...

36:12.922 --> 36:14.591
- Mr. Girly-man?
- That's not what I meant at all, man.

36:14.716 --> 36:16.885
Listen, I thought it'd be indelicate
to bring it up with Maddie.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.553
That's why I'm bringing it up with you.

36:19.888 --> 36:22.766
Well, that sounded like a threat, Nathan.
Are you threatening me?

36:23.266 --> 36:25.935
No, but actually, I feel like
you're starting to threaten me,

36:26.061 --> 36:28.063
which I don't think you want to go there.

36:31.858 --> 36:35.779
You know, this thing with that Ziggy kid,
all the talk of bullying?

36:37.947 --> 36:38.948
I was bullied.

36:39.449 --> 36:40.533
Sixth grade.

36:40.617 --> 36:43.620
And I always turned the other cheek,

36:43.745 --> 36:46.539
thinking that was
the more mature thing to do.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.920
Some 30 years later, it still haunts me

36:52.879 --> 36:55.799
that I didn't beat the shit out of that kid.

36:56.591 --> 36:59.219
So much so, I find myself fantasizing

36:59.928 --> 37:04.057
that somebody will come along
one day and say or do something to me,

37:05.934 --> 37:08.144
that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.983
You've always treated me quite well, Nathan.

37:15.402 --> 37:16.611
It's too bad.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.117
Too bad.

37:27.831 --> 37:28.915
(SCOFFS)

37:30.083 --> 37:32.585
The first thing I said,
the very first thing I said,

37:32.669 --> 37:33.962
it wasn't just the mothers.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.425
I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass,
you fuckin' talk to me like that again,

37:38.508 --> 37:39.759
you fuckin' little shit.

37:40.343 --> 37:43.847
Ed and Nathan hated each other's guts.
Are we all afraid to say that?

37:43.972 --> 37:46.141
<i>There's clearly a lot of
bad blood in this community.</i>

37:56.860 --> 37:57.944
MADELINE: <i>What did he say?</i>

37:58.027 --> 38:00.864
<i>JOSEPH: The mayor refuses to
authorize funding for the production.</i>

38:00.989 --> 38:03.950
MADELINE: <i>Well, it should be a legal matter
and we could make it a legal matter.</i>

38:04.033 --> 38:06.369
The funding is discretionary.
He could deny it on whatever grounds...

38:06.661 --> 38:07.704
Is he denying it?

38:07.829 --> 38:10.457
He's suggesting we pick
something more community-centric.

38:10.540 --> 38:13.042
Joseph, we have worked so hard for this.

38:13.168 --> 38:16.296
And we are being victimized
by the small-mindedness

38:16.379 --> 38:18.715
led by the likes of Renata Klein.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.217
Understood, but we need to pick our battles.
And this is just...

38:21.342 --> 38:24.387

38:37.817 --> 38:41.154
of the morally superior in this town
stepping all over everybody else.

with your artistic direction.

38:44.532 --> 38:45.700
That's all I'm asking.

38:45.992 --> 38:47.035

<i>we are investigating others on assault

41:09.719 --> 41:13.890
The intent, by all accounts,
was to simply make peace with Amabella.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.643
Which is an admission
that he did try to choke her.

41:16.726 --> 41:18.061
No, just hold on.

41:18.895 --> 41:21.731
Zigfield still maintains his innocence
on the whole choking front.

41:22.190 --> 41:26.069
The idea of brandishing affection
upon Amabella was first proffered by Chloe

41:26.194 --> 41:28.321
in an attempt to ameliorate
the birthday party brouhaha.

41:28.404 --> 41:31.032
I'm sorry, excuse me. Are you saying
Chloe had something to do with this?

41:31.199 --> 41:32.241
- Yes.
- RENATA: Yes.

41:32.325 --> 41:33.368
Mrs Klein.

41:35.495 --> 41:38.915
She played a song. She invited
Zigfield and Amabella to dance.

sanction a non-consensual touching.

Well, look, we have a policy, sir,
and we'll get to the bottom of it.

- Yes.

41:59.727 --> 42:02.105
Why don't you follow your policy,

- I'm there.
