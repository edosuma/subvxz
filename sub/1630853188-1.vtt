WEBVTT

01:04.814 --> 01:05.732
Thank you.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.066
Would you like something else?

01:07.150 --> 01:10.195
No. No, no, not just yet.
I'm waiting.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.572
I'm expecting someone.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.204
Would this be one
of your regular haunts?

02:01.287 --> 02:03.957
I don't have any regular
haunts.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.761
Let me see it.

02:25.645 --> 02:29.274
Sometimes I imagine I still
feel it around my neck.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.235
I carried it
for so many years.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.028
How does it feel around yours?

02:35.405 --> 02:37.991
We can free each other of it.

02:42.453 --> 02:46.082
Love to chatter, don't they,
our Muggle friends.

02:46.165 --> 02:49.168
Though one must admit,
they make a good cup of tea.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.840
What you're doing is madness.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.093
It's what we said we'd do.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.888
-I was young. I was...
-Committed.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.264
To me.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.892
To us.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.604
No.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.064
I went along because...

03:11.691 --> 03:12.775
Because?

03:12.859 --> 03:15.153
Because I was in love
with you.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.031
Yes.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.036
But that's not why
you went along.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.414
It was you who said
we could reshape the world.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.916
That it was our birthright.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.773
Can you smell it? The stench.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.029
Do you really intend to turn
your back on your own kind?

03:58.112 --> 03:59.822
For these animals?

04:02.408 --> 04:06.663
With or without you, I'll burn
down their world, Albus.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.999
There's nothing you can do
to stop me.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.964
Enjoy your cup of tea.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.248
She's ready.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.739
Beautiful.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.493
All right, you two.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.538
Now, the tricky bit.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.241
Accio.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.224
I'm so sorry.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.177
Twins.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.265
You had twins.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.620
Leave us.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.458
Show me.

12:40.509 --> 12:43.179
The others,
they said it was special.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.556
Ooh, it's beyond special.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.850
See?

12:48.684 --> 12:50.811
See its eyes?

12:50.895 --> 12:53.105
Those eyes see everything.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.152
When a Qilin is born,
a righteous leader will rise

12:58.235 --> 13:00.446
to change our world forever.

13:02.615 --> 13:07.995
Her birth brings change,
Credence, to everything.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.415
You did well.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.295
Go.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.463
Rest.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.426
-There.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.388
There.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.800
I don't suppose
you'd like to tell me

14:44.883 --> 14:46.468
what this is about, would you?

14:46.552 --> 14:47.678
He just asked that we meet,

14:47.761 --> 14:49.638
and that I be sure
to bring you.

14:50.806 --> 14:51.974
Hmm. Right.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.199
Here to meet my brother,
I expect.

15:09.283 --> 15:12.328
No, sir. We're here
to see Albus Dumbledore.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.876
-That would be my brother.
-Oh.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.503
Sorry. I'm, um... Brilliant.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.505
I'm Newt Scamander,
and this is Theseus--

15:23.589 --> 15:26.133
Up the stairs.
First on the left.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.356
Has Newt told you
why you're here?

15:41.398 --> 15:42.524
Was he meant to?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.235
No.
As a matter of fact.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.823
There's something
that we, uh...

15:49.907 --> 15:53.410
That, uh, Dumbledore wishes
to speak to you about.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.037
It's a proposal.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.000
All right.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.588
You know what this is,
of course.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.715
Newt had it in Paris.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.718
I can't say I have much
experience with such things,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.762
but it looks to me
to be a blood troth.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.848
That would be correct.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.267
And whose blood
is contained within?

16:18.143 --> 16:19.687
Mine.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.438
And Grindelwald's.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.985
I'm assuming that's why
you can't move against him?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.112
Yes.

16:28.987 --> 16:30.698
Nor he against me.

16:32.741 --> 16:35.285
Can I ask, what would possess
you to make such a thing?

16:36.453 --> 16:37.788
Love.

16:39.081 --> 16:43.293
Arrogance. Naivete.
Pick your poison.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.672
We were young, we were
going to transform the world.

16:46.755 --> 16:47.756
Mm.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.049
This ensured that we would,

16:49.133 --> 16:51.760
even if one of us
had a change of heart.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.597
And what would happen
if you were to fight him?

17:04.523 --> 17:08.736
It's really quite beautiful,
you have to admit.

17:11.113 --> 17:15.826
Were I to even
think about defying it...

17:27.212 --> 17:29.715
It knows, you see.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.721
Albus.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.848
It senses the betrayal
in my heart.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.975
-Albus.

17:43.937 --> 17:44.938
Albus.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.286
That would be the least of it.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.712
Young man's magic,
but as you can see,

18:09.838 --> 18:11.423
powerful magic.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.845
It can't be undone.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.269
So this proposal,

18:24.353 --> 18:26.230
I take it the Qilin
has something to do with it?

18:26.313 --> 18:28.065
He promises
he won't tell a soul.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.237
If we're to defeat him,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.614
the Qilin's only part of it.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.785
The world as we know it
is coming undone.

18:41.203 --> 18:45.749
Gellert's pulling it apart
with hate, bigotry.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.547
Things that seem
unimaginable today will seem

18:51.630 --> 18:54.091
inevitable tomorrow,

18:54.174 --> 18:55.843
if we don't stop him.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.180
Should you agree
to do what I ask,

19:00.973 --> 19:03.851
you'll have to trust me.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.436
Even when every instinct
tells you not to.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.698
Let's hear it.

19:43.056 --> 19:47.436
Does he send you to spy on me?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.272
No.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.107
But he asks.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.526
What ya thinkin',
what ya feeling.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.695
And the others?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.822
Does he ask what
they're thinking and feeling?

19:58.906 --> 20:02.534
Yes, but it's mostly you.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.912
And do you tell him?

20:07.247 --> 20:09.750
-You do.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.170
Who's reading whose mind now?

20:20.385 --> 20:22.221
Tell me what you see.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.767
You're a Dumbledore.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.520
It's an important family.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.482
You know this
because he's told you.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.237
He's also told you
they abandoned you.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.866
That you were a...
A dirty secret.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.829
Um... He says
Dumbledore abandoned him too,

20:47.913 --> 20:50.707
and he knows how you feel.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.126
And for that reason...

20:53.210 --> 20:55.963
For that reason,
he's asked you to kill him.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.677
I want you to go now, Queenie.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.265
I don't tell him.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.936
Not always.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.815
Not everything.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.844
Hey, we're...

22:28.764 --> 22:30.348
Queenie.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.892
Hi, sweetie.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.610
Honey...

22:41.693 --> 22:43.987
look at your bakery.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.530
It's like a ghost town.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.450
Yeah, well, I missed you.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.285
Oh, baby.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.954
Why don't you come here?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.332
Come here.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.923
-Hey.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.846
Everything's
gonna be all right.

23:09.930 --> 23:13.558
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

23:40.168 --> 23:44.172
Hey, sweetheart,
what brings you downtown?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.341
I really hope
you didn't spend all day

23:46.424 --> 23:48.385
coming up with that.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.682
Oh, you want scary,
is that what you want?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.517
You know what it is,

23:55.600 --> 23:58.019
you just aren't
menacing enough.

23:58.103 --> 24:02.107
I think I'm plenty menacing.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.901
Am I not menacing?

24:04.985 --> 24:07.195
Maybe if you waved
your arms around,

24:07.279 --> 24:08.947
you know, like a crazy man,

24:09.030 --> 24:11.616
then you'd appear
more menacing.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.499
That's good. A little more.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.129
A little more.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.964
Keep going. Perfect.

24:26.047 --> 24:29.593
-Three, two, one.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.719
Hey!

24:33.972 --> 24:36.766
That's enough. Get outta here.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.518
What's on your mind,
baker boy?

24:38.602 --> 24:39.769
Ah, jeez.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.479
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.647
Oh, well, we're not.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.566
It's a lady.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.611
I tell you what,

24:47.694 --> 24:49.362
I'll give you the first shot.
Go ahead.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.697
You sure?

24:50.780 --> 24:53.408
Oh, boy.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.251
Last time I ever help
that woman out again.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.669
Lally!

25:04.753 --> 25:07.130
Whoopsie, Frank. Sometimes
I forget my own strength.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.633
I'll take it from here.
Thank you!

25:09.716 --> 25:10.926
Welcome.

25:11.009 --> 25:12.844
-Catch you later, Lally.
-Bye, Stanley.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.804
I'll be over for a game
of Befudler Dudley soon.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.598
-All right.

25:16.681 --> 25:19.392
That's my cousin Stanley.
He's a wizard.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.936
No.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.854
Please! It's early,
don't make me work for it.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.314
I said I wanted out,
and I want out.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.941
Come now, Mr. Kowalski.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.943
Can't believe my therapist
said you wizards don't exist.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.362
What a waste of money!

25:30.445 --> 25:32.906
You do know
I'm a witch, right?

25:33.698 --> 25:34.616
Yeah.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.117
-Look...

25:36.201 --> 25:37.827
...you seem like
a really nice witch.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.788
You don't know what I've been
through with you people.

25:39.871 --> 25:43.541
So, could you please
get out of my life?

25:45.377 --> 25:47.462
-A little over a year ago...
-Oh, my...

25:47.545 --> 25:49.214
...in the hopes of securing
a small business loan,

25:49.297 --> 25:51.299
you walked through the doors
of the Steen National Bank,

25:51.383 --> 25:53.760
located about six blocks
from here.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.428
You then made the acquaintance
of Newt Scamander,

25:55.512 --> 25:59.307
the world's foremost and,
albeit only, magizoologist.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.725
You then learned of a world

26:00.809 --> 26:02.227
you had previously
been wholly unaware of.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.478
You met and fell in love

26:03.561 --> 26:04.854
with a witch
named Queenie Goldstein,

26:04.938 --> 26:06.898
had your brain wiped
by means of Obliviation,

26:06.982 --> 26:08.483
only it didn't take.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.236
And as a result, you reunited
with Ms. Goldstein who,

26:11.319 --> 26:14.406
after your refusal
to marry her, mm,

26:14.489 --> 26:15.991
decided to join
Gellert Grindelwald

26:16.074 --> 26:17.701
and his dark army
of followers,

26:17.784 --> 26:19.244
who pose
the single greatest threat

26:19.327 --> 26:22.080
to both your world and ours
in four centuries.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.665
How did I do?

26:23.748 --> 26:25.542
That was good.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.793
Except for the part

26:26.876 --> 26:29.504
about Queenie going over
to the dark side.

26:29.587 --> 26:33.133
I mean, yeah,
she's cuckoo.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.844
But she's got a heart bigger
than this whole crazy island,

26:35.927 --> 26:37.804
and she's so smart, you know?

26:37.887 --> 26:39.681
She can legitimately
read your brain, you know,

26:39.764 --> 26:40.849
she's a whatchamacallit...

26:40.932 --> 26:43.018
-A Legilimens.
-Yeah.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.939
Look...

26:51.401 --> 26:53.528
-You see this?

26:53.611 --> 26:57.324
You see the pan?
That's me, I'm the pan.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.410
I'm all dented, dime-a-dozen.
I'm just a schmo.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.037
I don't know
what kind of crazy ideas

27:02.120 --> 27:03.580
you have
in your head there, lady,

27:03.663 --> 27:05.707
but I'm sure as hell you could
do a lot better than me.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.584
Goodbye.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.461
I don't think we can,
Mr. Kowalski.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.049
You could have ducked under
the counter, but you didn't.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.302
You could have looked
the other way, but you didn't.

27:17.385 --> 27:20.430
In fact, you were willing
to put yourself in danger

27:20.513 --> 27:22.891
to save a perfect stranger.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.226
Seems to me you're just
the kind of average Joe

27:25.310 --> 27:27.270
the world needs right now.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.230
You just don't know it yet.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.608
That's why I had to show you.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.280
We need you, Mr. Kowalski.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.496
All right.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.539
Call me Jacob.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.582
Call me Lally.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.958
-Lally.
-Mm.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.293
I gotta lock up.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.343
-Thanks.
-Much better, Jacob.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.022
I believe you know
how this works, Jacob.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.148
Mm.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.226
What did they say
at the Ministry?

28:48.309 --> 28:49.978
Liu or Santos?

28:50.061 --> 28:53.022
Officially, the Ministry
takes no position.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.901
Unofficially,
smart money's on Santos.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.362
Although anyone
would be better than Vogel.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.655
Anyone?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.494
I don't believe
he's on the ballot, Kama.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.788
He also happens
to be a fugitive.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.331
Is there a difference?

29:12.750 --> 29:15.128
Spinning!
Always with the spinning.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.254
Jacob.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.007
Welcome. You brilliant man.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.341
Sorry.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.676
I was absolutely sure

29:21.759 --> 29:23.511
that Professor Hicks
would convince you.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.596
Yeah.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.930
You know me, pal.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.641
I can't pass up
a good Portkey.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.603
Mr. Scamander.

29:31.686 --> 29:32.687
Professor Hicks.

29:32.770 --> 29:33.938
At long last.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.399
So, Professor Hicks and I,

29:36.483 --> 29:38.359
we've corresponded
for many years,

29:38.443 --> 29:39.861
but we've never actually met.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.197
So, her book on advanced
charm casting is a must-read.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.531
Newt is far too kind.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.617
Fantastic Beasts
is required reading

29:45.700 --> 29:47.243
for all my fifth years.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.204
Now, let me make
some introductions.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.623
So, this is, um,
Bunty Broadacre,

29:51.706 --> 29:53.833
my indispensable assistant
for the past seven years.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.461
Eight... years.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.838
And 164 days.

29:58.922 --> 29:59.881
Hmm.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.591
As you can see, indispensable.

30:01.674 --> 30:02.884
And this is...

30:02.967 --> 30:04.969
Yusuf Kama.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.471
Pleasure.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.933
And you, obviously, already
made Jacob's acquaintance.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.520
Newt.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.232
So... So, this is my brother,
Theseus,

30:17.315 --> 30:19.734
and, um, he works
for the Ministry.

30:19.817 --> 30:22.070
Actually, head
of the British Auror Office.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.488
Ah! Well, I'll have to ensure

30:23.571 --> 30:25.698
my wand registration's
up to date.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.825
Yes.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.077
Although, strictly speaking,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.328
that doesn't fall
within my purview.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.257
Oh.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.349
All right then.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.184
Well, I imagine
that you're all wondering

30:53.268 --> 30:55.478
why you find yourselves here.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.438
And in anticipation of that,

30:57.522 --> 31:00.692
Dumbledore asked
that I convey a message.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.777
So, Grindelwald
has the ability

31:02.860 --> 31:05.280
to see snatches of the future.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.616
So, we have to assume that
he'll be able to anticipate

31:08.700 --> 31:10.618
what we do before we do it.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.956
So, if we hope to defeat him
and to save our world,

31:15.039 --> 31:17.667
to save your world, Jacob,

31:17.750 --> 31:21.504
then our best hope
is to confuse him.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.131
Uh...

31:24.215 --> 31:25.800
'Scuse me.

31:25.883 --> 31:28.886
I'm sorry. How do you confuse
a guy that can see the future?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.055
Countersight.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.849
Exactly.

31:32.932 --> 31:35.143
The best plan being no plan.

31:35.226 --> 31:36.978
Or, many overlapping plans.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.479
Thus, confusion.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.981
It's working on me right now.

31:41.649 --> 31:44.652
In fact, Dumbledore asked that
I give you something, Jacob.

31:53.536 --> 31:54.996
It's snakewood.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.664
It's, uh, somewhat rare.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.833
Are you kiddin' me right now?

31:58.916 --> 32:00.376
Is this thing real?

32:00.460 --> 32:01.836
Yes.

32:01.919 --> 32:05.048
Well, it doesn't have a core,
so sort of, but yes.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.591
It's sorta real?

32:09.469 --> 32:13.389
More importantly, where
we're going, you'll need it.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.767
Now, there's something
for you too, I think, Theseus.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.143
Um...

32:17.226 --> 32:20.229
-Teddy, please let go now.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.106
-Teddy, please let go.

32:23.149 --> 32:25.526
No. Teddy, will you behave?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.862
This is Theseus'...

32:33.159 --> 32:34.535
Um, that's...

32:34.619 --> 32:36.162
Well, of course.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.040
Now everything makes sense.

32:39.123 --> 32:42.043
Um, Lally, I believe you were
given some reading material?

32:42.126 --> 32:43.503
You know what they say.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.921
A book can take you around
the world and back,

32:45.004 --> 32:46.923
all you have to do is open it.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.049
She ain't kiddin'.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.510
Yes, uh, Bunty, um...

32:51.594 --> 32:52.762
that's for you.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.889
I was told
it was for your eyes only.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.808
Oh.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.276
Oh.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.779
And, Kama.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.906
I have what I need.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.744
What about Tina?
Uh, is Tina coming?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.496
Tina's not available.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.956
Um...

33:20.039 --> 33:23.751
Tina's been promoted,
she's very, very busy from...

33:23.835 --> 33:25.336
Well, from what I understand.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.881
Tina's been made head
of the American Auror Office.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.258
-Oh.
-We know each other well.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.469
She's quite
a remarkable woman.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.430
She is.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.098
So, this is the team
that's gonna take down

33:37.181 --> 33:40.268
the most dangerous wizard
we've faced in over a century.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.687
A magizoologist,
his indispensable assistant,

33:42.770 --> 33:44.105
a schoolteacher,

33:44.188 --> 33:46.566
a wizard descended
from a very old French family,

33:46.649 --> 33:47.900
and...

33:47.984 --> 33:50.611
a Muggle baker

33:50.695 --> 33:52.029
with his fake wand.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.949
Hey, we got you too, pal,

33:55.032 --> 33:56.576
and his wand works.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.622
Who wouldn't like our chances?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.667
Oh. Uh...

34:28.399 --> 34:30.067
You're all right, little one.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.076
Berlin.

34:39.410 --> 34:40.703
Wonderful.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.628
Kama,

34:48.711 --> 34:50.379
stay safe.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.478
I must be going too now, Newt.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.897
No one can know everything,

35:09.315 --> 35:10.900
not even you.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.102
Right.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.396
Well, here it is.

36:04.745 --> 36:05.913
Huh.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.297
German Ministry of Magic?

36:14.380 --> 36:15.464
Yes.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.721
I take it we're here
for a reason.

36:21.804 --> 36:24.849
Yes, we have
a tea ceremony to attend,

36:24.932 --> 36:28.394
and if we don't hurry up,
we'll be late.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.940
Jacob, stay with the group.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.454
Santos! Santos! Santos!

36:47.872 --> 36:49.790
Santos! Santos! Santos!

36:59.967 --> 37:01.177
Evening...

37:02.511 --> 37:03.638
Helmut.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.640
-Theseus.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.683
Hey, hey.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.436
They're with me.

37:24.241 --> 37:27.703
Santos! Santos! Santos!

37:35.628 --> 37:36.921
Incendio.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.696
I take it we're not here
for the finger sandwiches.

38:01.779 --> 38:05.700
Uh, no, I have
a message to deliver.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.076
A message?

38:07.910 --> 38:09.370
To who?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.708
Mr. Vogel,
it's a pleasure to be here.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.292
It's an honor to meet you.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.044
You are joking.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.089
No.

38:20.172 --> 38:22.758
What am I even
doing here? Let's go outside.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.719
I'm not very good
in these situations.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.303
These situations?

38:26.387 --> 38:28.848
-With all the people,
the fancy people.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.351
Hello.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.603
I saw you enter the room

38:34.687 --> 38:36.230
and I thought to myself,

38:36.313 --> 38:39.734
Edith, that's
an interesting-looking man.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.652
Jacob Kowalski.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.863
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

38:43.946 --> 38:47.241
And where is it you hail from,
Mr. Kowalski?

38:47.324 --> 38:49.702
Queens.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.579
Ah!

38:51.662 --> 38:53.122
Sorry, Herr Vogel.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.833
Sorry, I wonder
if I could have a word?

38:57.084 --> 38:58.377
Oh!

38:58.461 --> 39:01.714
Merlin's beard,
it's Mr. Scamander, isn't it?

39:01.797 --> 39:03.007
Herr Vogel...

39:05.885 --> 39:08.304
I have a message
from a friend,

39:08.387 --> 39:11.098
and it cannot wait.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.979
Do what is right,

39:17.730 --> 39:19.356
not what is easy.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.861
He said it was important
that I reach you tonight,

39:23.944 --> 39:27.448
that you hear them tonight,
the words.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.409
It's time, sir.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.750
Is he here?

39:37.833 --> 39:39.293
In Berlin?

39:40.878 --> 39:42.922
No, of course not.

39:43.005 --> 39:46.675
Why leave Hogwarts when
the world outside is burning?

39:51.847 --> 39:54.850
I thank you, Mr. Scamander.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.554
Thank you.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.014
Thank you.

40:36.559 --> 40:40.187
I see many familiar faces
here tonight.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.023
Colleagues, friends,

40:44.275 --> 40:45.317
foes.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.655
Within the next 48 hours,

40:49.738 --> 40:53.409
you, along with the rest of
the Wizarding World,

40:53.492 --> 40:55.953
will choose
our next great leader.

40:56.036 --> 40:58.414
A choice
that will shape our lives

40:58.497 --> 41:01.292
for generations to come.

41:01.375 --> 41:07.339
I have little doubt that,
no matter who should triumph,

41:07.423 --> 41:10.092
the Confederation
will be in able hands.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.719
Liu Tao.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.561
Vicencia Santos.

41:22.396 --> 41:25.441
Thank you, thank you.

41:28.194 --> 41:30.988
It's in moments such as these
we are reminded

41:31.071 --> 41:34.241
that it is this peaceful
transfer of power

41:34.325 --> 41:36.285
which marks our humanity

41:36.368 --> 41:41.248
and demonstrates to the world
that, despite our differences,

41:41.332 --> 41:43.918
all voices
deserve to be heard...

41:45.836 --> 41:49.089
even voices which many
may find disagreeable.

41:51.425 --> 41:52.676
Newt.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.511
Any of those lot
look familiar to you?

41:58.849 --> 42:02.603
Paris. The night that Leta...

42:02.686 --> 42:05.105
They were with Grindelwald.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.567
Mm.

42:17.743 --> 42:22.289
And so, after
an extensive investigation,

42:22.373 --> 42:25.459
the Confederation
has concluded

42:25.542 --> 42:28.587
that insufficient evidence
exists

42:29.964 --> 42:32.633
to prosecute
Gellert Grindelwald

42:32.716 --> 42:34.927
for the crimes
against the Muggle community

42:35.010 --> 42:38.305
-of which he was accused.

42:38.389 --> 42:44.061
He is hereby absolved
of all his alleged crimes.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.024
Are you kidding me?

42:49.108 --> 42:50.943
They're letting the guy off?

42:51.026 --> 42:52.820
I was there,
he was killing people.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.114
You're under arrest.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.992
All of you.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.118
Wands down!

43:07.585 --> 43:08.711
Theseus.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.839
Theseus!

43:11.922 --> 43:15.009
Newt, Newt. Not here.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.636
Newt, we don't stand a chance.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.680
Let's go. Newt,

43:19.763 --> 43:22.349
they have the German Ministry.
We've got to go.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.853
It ain't right.
That's not justice.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.105
"Extended investigation."
I was there.

43:28.188 --> 43:30.691
Were you there?
Were you there? I was there.

43:30.774 --> 43:32.860
-You just let a killer off!
-Jacob.

43:32.943 --> 43:33.902
Whoa!

43:33.986 --> 43:35.779
We have to go. We have to go.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.781
Jacob, let's go.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.815
That's very good.

44:14.651 --> 44:16.570
Her favorite.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.700
Remember how she begged Mother
to make it?

44:24.536 --> 44:26.205
Ariana.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.084
Mother claimed it calmed her,

44:30.167 --> 44:31.752
but I think
that was wishful thinking.

44:31.835 --> 44:32.961
Albus.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.131
I was there.

44:36.215 --> 44:37.925
I grew up in the same house.

44:38.008 --> 44:41.428
Everything you saw, I saw.

44:45.974 --> 44:48.102
Everything.

45:00.030 --> 45:03.117
Read the sign, you stupid sod.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.835
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Albus.

45:12.918 --> 45:14.461
Tell me, what is it?

45:14.545 --> 45:16.672
It's Berlin.

45:16.755 --> 45:18.382
What happened?

45:18.465 --> 45:22.469
Vogel has absolved
Gellert of all his crimes.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.473
He's free.
He says there's no proof.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.767
He tried to arrest Aurors
who were there

45:28.851 --> 45:30.727
the night Leta Lestrange
was murdered.

45:42.573 --> 45:45.659
Rather disappointing.

45:45.742 --> 45:47.995
I'm going to need someone
to cover my morning classes.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.705
Can I impose on you?

45:49.788 --> 45:52.583
Of course.
And, Albus, please be...

45:52.666 --> 45:54.585
I'll do my best.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.672
Evening, Aberforth.

45:58.755 --> 46:00.174
Evening, Minerva.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.468
Apologies for calling you
a stupid sod.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.262
Apology accepted.

46:08.932 --> 46:11.602
I'm afraid I'll
have to cut our evening short.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.604
Off to save the world, are we?

46:13.687 --> 46:15.939
That will take
a better man than me.

46:20.777 --> 46:22.404
Don't ask.

46:59.525 --> 47:01.109
There are thousands
in the streets

47:01.193 --> 47:03.195
chanting your name.

47:03.278 --> 47:05.155
You're a free man.

47:10.327 --> 47:12.788
Tell the others
to prepare to leave.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.958
-Tonight?
-Tomorrow.

47:16.041 --> 47:18.293
We'll have a visitor
in the morning.

47:23.340 --> 47:26.260
Why does it stay
with him?

47:26.343 --> 47:28.679
It must sense
what he's about to do.

47:30.472 --> 47:32.015
And you're sure

47:33.183 --> 47:35.727
that he can kill Dumbledore?

47:37.437 --> 47:39.523
His pain is his power.

47:46.530 --> 47:47.906
The man
that I am inquiring about

47:47.990 --> 47:49.491
is the head
of the British Auror Office.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.826
How can you have misplaced

47:50.909 --> 47:52.911
the head
of the British Auror Office?

47:55.747 --> 47:56.957
As our contention said,

47:57.040 --> 47:59.501
since he was
never in our custody,

47:59.585 --> 48:00.794
we never misplaced him.

48:00.877 --> 48:02.546
Sir, there were dozens
of people there.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.131
Any one of them
could corroborate...

48:04.214 --> 48:06.717
-And your name is?
-Let's get out of here.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.219
Wait a minute, that's the guy.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.971
Come here. Come here.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.222
Excuse me!

48:12.306 --> 48:13.307
Hey!

48:15.809 --> 48:17.603
That's the guy.
He knows where Theseus is.

48:17.686 --> 48:18.687
Hello!

48:20.063 --> 48:21.857
Where's Theseus?

48:21.940 --> 48:24.735
That's him.
He knows about Theseus.

48:46.131 --> 48:47.174
Newt.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.302
Ah.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.648
Albus.

49:06.777 --> 49:09.696
Theseus has been taken
to the Erkstag.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.366
Wait, no, but the Erkstag
shut down years ago.

49:12.449 --> 49:13.950
Yes, well,

49:14.034 --> 49:17.579
it's the Ministry's secret
little bed and breakfast now.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.831
You'll need this to see him.

49:20.999 --> 49:22.376
-And one of these.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.338
-Mm-hmm.
-And this.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.635
-Wait, wait, wait.

49:33.011 --> 49:36.223
I trust you're enjoying
your wand, Mr. Kowalski?

49:36.306 --> 49:39.559
Me? Oh, uh... Yeah, thank you,
Mr. Dumbledore.

49:39.643 --> 49:40.936
It's a real pip.

49:41.019 --> 49:42.354
I advise you to keep it close.

49:42.437 --> 49:44.064
-Professor Hicks.
-Dumbledore.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.441
Assuming you're
not otherwise engaged,

49:46.525 --> 49:48.068
and frankly even if you are,

49:48.151 --> 49:50.404
I encourage you to attend
tonight's candidates' dinner.

49:50.487 --> 49:51.947
Take Mr. Kowalski.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.241
I'm quite certain there'll be
an assassination attempt.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.076
Anything you can do
to scotch that

49:56.159 --> 49:57.661
will be greatly appreciated.

49:57.744 --> 49:58.745
It's my pleasure.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.122
I shall welcome the challenge.

50:00.205 --> 50:03.375
Besides,
I'll have Jacob with me.

50:03.458 --> 50:04.668
Oh, not to worry.

50:04.751 --> 50:07.921
Professor Hicks'
defensive magic is superb.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.923
Until next time.

50:10.006 --> 50:11.591
Such a flatterer.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.553
Well, not really.
It is superb.

50:15.303 --> 50:16.513
Albus!

50:16.596 --> 50:18.807
I was just wondering...

50:18.890 --> 50:19.933
Ah.

50:21.059 --> 50:22.060
Yes.

50:23.645 --> 50:24.980
-The case.
-Yes.

50:25.063 --> 50:28.066
Rest assured,
it's in safe hands.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.165
Can I help you?

50:43.248 --> 50:45.000
Yes.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.503
I'd like to have this case
replicated, please.

50:48.587 --> 50:49.796
Certainly.

50:51.506 --> 50:54.801
Oh. No, you mustn't open it.

50:54.885 --> 50:59.139
Um, I mean,
it's not necessary.

50:59.222 --> 51:02.309
The interior isn't important.

51:02.392 --> 51:05.854
I see no reason
I can't make you one.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.202
If you leave it here.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.828
Oh. No...

51:21.912 --> 51:24.790
I couldn't leave it.

51:24.873 --> 51:28.502
And I'll be needing
more than one.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.129
You see, um...

51:31.213 --> 51:34.800
my husband...
he's a bit absentminded.

51:34.883 --> 51:36.676
He's always forgetting things.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.970
Just the other day, he forgot
he was married to me.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.475
Can you imagine?

51:47.854 --> 51:50.565
But I love him.

51:50.649 --> 51:53.193
Exactly how many
were you thinking?

51:53.276 --> 51:54.694
Um...

51:54.778 --> 51:56.071
Half a dozen,

51:56.154 --> 51:58.990
and I'll need them
in two days' time.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.292
Show your hands.

52:14.631 --> 52:15.882
Who are you?

52:16.675 --> 52:18.552
My name is Yusuf Kama.

52:20.053 --> 52:21.638
Who's our visitor?

52:21.721 --> 52:23.640
I'm an admirer.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.934
You murdered his sister.

52:26.768 --> 52:28.687
Her name was Leta.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.065
Leta Lestrange.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.109
Ah, yes.

52:34.192 --> 52:36.570
You and your sister
share an ancient bloodline.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.904
Shared.

52:37.988 --> 52:41.074
That's the only thing
we shared.

52:41.157 --> 52:45.036
Dumbledore sent you,
am I right?

52:45.120 --> 52:48.248
He fears you're in possession
of a creature.

52:48.331 --> 52:51.418
He fears the use
you may put it to.

52:51.501 --> 52:53.795
He sent me here to spy on you.

52:55.672 --> 52:57.924
What would you like
me to tell him?

53:00.677 --> 53:01.845
Queenie.

53:03.179 --> 53:05.307
Is he telling the truth?

53:18.069 --> 53:19.321
What else?

53:19.404 --> 53:21.156
Even though
he believes in you,

53:21.239 --> 53:24.200
he holds you responsible
for his sister's death.

53:25.702 --> 53:29.623
He carries her absence
with him every day.

53:29.706 --> 53:33.209
Every breath he takes
is a reminder
that she breathes no more.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.212
Then I presume you won't mind

53:36.296 --> 53:38.506
if I relieve you
of your sister's memory.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.138
Right?

53:46.222 --> 53:47.474
Right.

54:09.371 --> 54:10.497
There.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.625
Better?

54:14.834 --> 54:16.252
I thought so.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.672
When we allow ourselves
to be consumed by anger,

54:18.755 --> 54:20.882
the only victim is ourself.

54:23.259 --> 54:26.012
Now, we were just
about to depart.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.473
Perhaps you'd like to join us?

54:28.556 --> 54:30.517
Come, we can talk some more

54:30.600 --> 54:32.978
about our mutual friend,
Dumbledore.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.113
After you.

56:10.867 --> 56:12.577
Hello, Credence.

56:19.709 --> 56:23.797
Do you know what it's like
to have no one?

56:23.880 --> 56:26.091
To always be alone?

56:27.383 --> 56:28.635
It's you.

56:31.387 --> 56:34.557
You're the one sending
messages in the mirror.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.519
I'm a Dumbledore.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.146
You abandoned me.

56:41.397 --> 56:45.652
The same blood that runs
my veins runs yours.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.455
He's not here for you.

56:57.539 --> 56:59.124
He's here for me.

57:45.086 --> 57:49.299
Things are not quite
what they appear, Credence,

57:49.382 --> 57:52.051
no matter
what you've been told.

57:54.053 --> 57:55.847
My name is Aurelius.

57:55.930 --> 57:57.390
He's lied to you.

57:57.473 --> 57:58.892
Kindled your hate.

58:59.410 --> 59:02.163
What he's told you
isn't true...

59:03.873 --> 59:06.542
but we do share
the same blood.

59:07.752 --> 59:11.089
You are a Dumbledore.

59:23.726 --> 59:26.437
I'm sorry for your pain.

59:26.521 --> 59:29.232
We didn't know, I promise.

1:00:23.578 --> 1:00:25.371
I've come
to see my brother.

1:00:25.455 --> 1:00:27.457
His name is Theseus Scamander.

1:00:36.174 --> 1:00:37.717
Sorry, that's, uh...

1:00:39.761 --> 1:00:41.179
Wand.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:57.445
Oh, that's, uh...

1:00:57.528 --> 1:01:00.656
I'm... I'm a magizoologist.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.658
He's perfectly harmless.
He's...

1:01:02.742 --> 1:01:04.702
He's just a pet, really.

1:01:06.245 --> 1:01:08.122
-Sorry.

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:12.251
That's Teddy.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:14.170
He's a total nightmare,
truth be told.

1:01:14.253 --> 1:01:15.797
They stay here.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:40.279
So, how will I know
where to find him?

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:41.781
He's your brother?

1:01:42.865 --> 1:01:44.158
Yes.

1:01:44.242 --> 1:01:46.786
He will be the one
who looks like your brother.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:53.167
I will be back, Pick.

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:54.585
On my word.

1:02:00.883 --> 1:02:02.760
"I'll be back, Pick.

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:05.179
On my word."

1:02:05.263 --> 1:02:08.599
And I'll be Minister of Magic
one day.

1:02:47.805 --> 1:02:50.099
-Take us 'round the back.

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:51.434
It's not safe here.

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:53.019
No.

1:02:53.102 --> 1:02:54.437
Roll it down.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.771
What?

1:02:56.481 --> 1:02:58.024
The window.

1:02:58.107 --> 1:02:59.484
Roll it down.

1:03:11.662 --> 1:03:13.748
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.629
No. No!

1:03:28.471 --> 1:03:29.889
Those people

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:32.058
aren't suggesting
we listen to them.

1:03:32.141 --> 1:03:34.685
They aren't
asking us to listen.

1:03:34.769 --> 1:03:36.979
They're demanding it.

1:03:37.063 --> 1:03:40.900
You're actually proposing that
that man be allowed to stand?

1:03:40.983 --> 1:03:42.902
Yes.

1:03:42.985 --> 1:03:44.278
Yes, let him stand.

1:03:48.241 --> 1:03:50.451
Gellert Grindelwald
wants a Muggle-wizard war,

1:03:50.535 --> 1:03:52.161
and if he gets his wish,

1:03:52.245 --> 1:03:53.579
he won't just destroy
their world,

1:03:53.663 --> 1:03:54.956
he'll destroy ours as well.

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:57.041
Which is why he cannot win.

1:03:58.501 --> 1:04:00.169
Let him stand as a candidate.

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:01.921
Let the people vote.

1:04:02.004 --> 1:04:04.882
When he loses,
the people will have spoken.

1:04:04.966 --> 1:04:07.593
But deny them their voices,

1:04:07.677 --> 1:04:11.138
and those streets
will run with blood.

1:04:33.578 --> 1:04:34.704
Theseus.

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:40.960
Theseus.

1:06:17.515 --> 1:06:19.058
Lally,

1:06:19.141 --> 1:06:20.893
the guy with the hair,

1:06:21.686 --> 1:06:24.021
sitting next to Edith.

1:06:24.105 --> 1:06:26.273
He looks like
he can kill somebody.

1:06:27.608 --> 1:06:29.902
He also looks like
my Uncle Dominic.

1:06:29.985 --> 1:06:31.237
Is your Uncle Dominic

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:33.698
the Norwegian Minister
of Magic?

1:06:33.781 --> 1:06:34.907
No.

1:06:34.990 --> 1:06:36.534
Didn't think so.

1:07:05.896 --> 1:07:06.897
Queenie.

1:07:08.190 --> 1:07:09.191
Queenie.

1:07:18.159 --> 1:07:19.452
Ah.

1:07:19.535 --> 1:07:23.289
Madam Santos, a pleasure.

1:07:23.372 --> 1:07:25.541
Your supporters
are in fine voice.

1:07:25.624 --> 1:07:29.170
As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald.

1:07:48.814 --> 1:07:50.316
Rescuing me, are you?

1:07:50.399 --> 1:07:51.984
That's the general idea.
-Huh.

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:54.737
And I presume this,

1:07:54.820 --> 1:07:57.823
whatever it is that
you are doing, is strategic.

1:07:57.907 --> 1:07:59.992
Yes, a technique
called limbic mimicry.

1:08:00.075 --> 1:08:02.536
It discourages
violent engagement,

1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:03.954
theoretically.

1:08:04.038 --> 1:08:06.540
I've only actually ever
attempted it once before.

1:08:06.624 --> 1:08:09.084
-And the results?
-Uh...

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:11.420
Inconclusive.

1:08:11.504 --> 1:08:12.838
Course that was
a laboratory setting

1:08:12.922 --> 1:08:14.423
and the conditions
were strictly controlled,

1:08:14.507 --> 1:08:15.841
and the...

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:17.468
Well, the current conditions
are more volatile,

1:08:17.551 --> 1:08:19.261
so making it less predictive
of the ultimate outcome.

1:08:19.345 --> 1:08:21.806
The ultimate outcome
presumably...

1:08:22.807 --> 1:08:26.936
being our survival.

1:09:20.030 --> 1:09:22.449
Well done, come on.

1:09:27.788 --> 1:09:29.582
And the plan is?

1:09:29.665 --> 1:09:30.875
Hold this.

1:09:46.682 --> 1:09:48.851
What the bloody
hell was that for?

1:09:48.934 --> 1:09:50.269
Um...

1:09:50.352 --> 1:09:52.062
We're gonna need some help.

1:10:01.864 --> 1:10:03.198
Follow me.

1:10:08.078 --> 1:10:09.246
Come on.

1:10:18.714 --> 1:10:20.966
You're not swiveling properly.

1:10:21.050 --> 1:10:22.092
Swivel...

1:10:22.176 --> 1:10:24.803
Swivel, but delicately.

1:10:24.887 --> 1:10:27.473
I'm swiveling
like you're swiveling, Newt.

1:10:27.556 --> 1:10:29.224
I don't believe you are.

1:10:48.535 --> 1:10:49.620
Swivel.

1:11:02.925 --> 1:11:04.218
Go to him.

1:11:12.393 --> 1:11:13.394
Queenie.

1:11:18.065 --> 1:11:20.275
Tell him it's all right.

1:11:20.359 --> 1:11:22.778
I can see he's failed.

1:11:22.861 --> 1:11:24.530
He'll have another chance.

1:11:25.990 --> 1:11:28.659
It's his loyalty I most value.

1:12:03.152 --> 1:12:04.486
Stay here.

1:12:24.757 --> 1:12:25.799
Oh.

1:12:27.051 --> 1:12:28.093
Apologies.

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.641
Hmm.

1:12:54.369 --> 1:12:56.538
Let her go.

1:12:56.622 --> 1:12:57.915
Excuse me?

1:13:06.715 --> 1:13:08.509
-Assassin!
-Huh?

1:15:10.797 --> 1:15:11.840
Huh?

1:17:19.551 --> 1:17:20.469
No, wait.

1:17:35.650 --> 1:17:37.069
Newt!

1:17:40.405 --> 1:17:41.490
Accio!

1:17:42.449 --> 1:17:43.658
Grab the tie.

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:34.126
That was a Portkey.

1:18:34.793 --> 1:18:35.794
Yeah.

1:18:38.922 --> 1:18:40.715
Well done, you two.

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:06.158
Not that either of you asked,

1:19:06.241 --> 1:19:08.660
but I would highly recommend
learning Charms.

1:19:08.743 --> 1:19:09.828
Lally.

1:19:09.911 --> 1:19:11.121
What kept you two?

1:19:11.204 --> 1:19:14.499
Uh, we encountered
some complications. You?

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:17.335
We encountered
some complications.

1:19:21.381 --> 1:19:23.216
Jacob tried
to murder Grindelwald?

1:19:23.300 --> 1:19:25.218
-It's a long story.

1:19:25.302 --> 1:19:27.012
Is it really snakewood?

1:19:27.095 --> 1:19:29.181
Yes, it's really snakewood.

1:19:29.264 --> 1:19:32.100
-Can I...
-Mm-mm.

1:19:32.184 --> 1:19:34.227
Very dangerous.

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:35.729
It's very powerful.

1:19:35.812 --> 1:19:38.398
It's rare. If it got
in the wrong hands, you know,

1:19:38.482 --> 1:19:39.483
mess you up.

1:19:39.566 --> 1:19:41.276
Where did you get it?

1:19:42.235 --> 1:19:43.945
I got it for Christmas.

1:19:44.029 --> 1:19:45.197
Jacob,

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:46.615
look who I found.

1:19:46.698 --> 1:19:47.866
Hey.

1:19:47.949 --> 1:19:50.035
It's my wizard friends,
Newt and Theseus.

1:19:50.118 --> 1:19:52.454
We're like this, okay,
and that's me right there.

1:19:52.537 --> 1:19:55.540
I gotta go.
All right, have fun.

1:19:55.624 --> 1:19:57.876
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1:19:57.959 --> 1:19:59.377
Can you believe this place?

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:00.712
They got pint-sized
little witches and wizards

1:20:00.795 --> 1:20:01.630
running around here.

1:20:01.713 --> 1:20:03.548
You don't say.

1:20:03.632 --> 1:20:05.467
I was the assassin.

1:20:05.550 --> 1:20:07.427
Newt and Theseus
both went to Hogwarts.

1:20:07.511 --> 1:20:08.637
Oh, I knew that.

1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:10.222
Well, they're being
very nice to me.

1:20:10.305 --> 1:20:11.598
The Slytherin boys over there,
they gave me these.

1:20:11.681 --> 1:20:13.892
They're delicious.
Who wants one?

1:20:13.975 --> 1:20:16.311
I never cared for cockroach
clusters much myself,

1:20:16.394 --> 1:20:20.148
although Honeydukes
are supposed to be the best.

1:20:24.819 --> 1:20:26.613
Off you go.

1:20:26.696 --> 1:20:27.822
McGonagall.

1:20:28.490 --> 1:20:29.574
Albus.

1:20:29.658 --> 1:20:30.742
Well done.

1:20:30.826 --> 1:20:32.327
All of you, well done.

1:20:32.410 --> 1:20:33.411
Congratulations.

1:20:33.495 --> 1:20:35.038
-Congratulations?
-Indeed.

1:20:35.121 --> 1:20:39.042
Professor Hicks managed
to foil an assassination.

1:20:39.125 --> 1:20:41.670
And you are alive
and you are well.

1:20:41.753 --> 1:20:44.673
The fact that everything
didn't go precisely to plan

1:20:44.756 --> 1:20:46.132
was precisely the plan.

1:20:46.216 --> 1:20:47.634
Countersight 101.

1:20:47.717 --> 1:20:50.095
Albus, forgive me, but aren't
we back where we started?

1:20:50.178 --> 1:20:52.973
Actually, I would argue
that things are...

1:20:53.056 --> 1:20:55.308
a great deal worse.

1:20:57.310 --> 1:20:59.938
You haven't told them,
have you?

1:21:00.021 --> 1:21:03.108
Grindelwald's been allowed
to stand in the election.

1:21:04.025 --> 1:21:05.777
-What?
-But how?

1:21:05.860 --> 1:21:09.656
Because Vogel chose easy
over right.

1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:33.263
Hmm.

1:21:34.347 --> 1:21:35.807
It's all right.

1:21:35.890 --> 1:21:36.975
Bhutan.

1:21:37.058 --> 1:21:39.519
Correct.
Three points to Hufflepuff.

1:21:39.603 --> 1:21:41.605
The kingdom of Bhutan

1:21:41.688 --> 1:21:43.481
sits high
in the Eastern Himalayas.

1:21:43.565 --> 1:21:47.277
It's a place
of indescribable beauty.

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:50.947
Some of our most important
magic has its origins there.

1:21:51.031 --> 1:21:53.658
They say if you
listen carefully enough,

1:21:53.742 --> 1:21:57.120
the past whispers to you.

1:21:57.203 --> 1:21:59.914
It also happens to be where
the election will be held.

1:21:59.998 --> 1:22:01.374
He can't win, can he?

1:22:01.458 --> 1:22:03.752
Only a few days ago he was
a fugitive from justice.

1:22:03.835 --> 1:22:06.671
Now he is
an official candidate

1:22:06.755 --> 1:22:09.424
in the International
Confederation of Wizards.

1:22:11.134 --> 1:22:14.304
Dangerous times
favor dangerous men.

1:22:16.431 --> 1:22:17.766
By the way,

1:22:17.849 --> 1:22:19.851
we'll be dining with
my brother in the village.

1:22:19.934 --> 1:22:23.605
Should you need anything
before then, Minerva is here.

1:22:23.688 --> 1:22:25.774
Dumbledore has a brother?

1:22:29.110 --> 1:22:30.445
Huh.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.377
Here we are.

1:22:49.589 --> 1:22:51.341
Bunty, you're here.

1:22:51.424 --> 1:22:52.425
Yes.

1:22:54.135 --> 1:22:55.136
How is she?

1:22:55.220 --> 1:22:56.429
Oh, she's fine.

1:22:57.430 --> 1:22:58.431
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:22:58.515 --> 1:23:00.100
What's Alfie done now?

1:23:00.183 --> 1:23:01.351
Wait, you've not been biting

1:23:01.434 --> 1:23:02.519
Timothy's bottom again,
have you?

1:23:02.602 --> 1:23:03.895
Miss Broadacre,

1:23:03.978 --> 1:23:07.565
I trust my brother
has been a gracious host?

1:23:07.649 --> 1:23:10.026
Yes, ever so gracious.

1:23:10.110 --> 1:23:11.528
I'm delighted to hear.

1:23:11.611 --> 1:23:13.613
Uh, so,
rooms have been arranged

1:23:13.697 --> 1:23:15.073
for you in the village,

1:23:15.156 --> 1:23:16.282
and Aberforth here

1:23:16.366 --> 1:23:18.702
will prepare you
a delicious dinner,

1:23:18.785 --> 1:23:20.412
his own recipe.

1:23:26.918 --> 1:23:29.087
There's more of that
if you want it.

1:23:33.508 --> 1:23:34.801
Thank you.

1:23:35.510 --> 1:23:36.636
Thanks.

1:23:39.931 --> 1:23:41.224
Astonishing.

1:23:41.307 --> 1:23:42.809
Never has something
that looks so repellent

1:23:42.892 --> 1:23:44.936
tasted so delicious.

1:23:45.019 --> 1:23:46.771
-Who is this little one?

1:23:46.855 --> 1:23:48.523
Do you mind?

1:23:48.606 --> 1:23:50.525
She's a Qilin, Jacob.

1:23:50.608 --> 1:23:52.360
She's incredibly rare.

1:23:52.444 --> 1:23:53.862
One of
the most beloved creatures

1:23:53.945 --> 1:23:55.405
in the Wizarding World.

1:23:55.488 --> 1:23:56.781
Why?

1:23:56.865 --> 1:23:59.159
'Cause she can see
into your soul.

1:23:59.242 --> 1:24:00.577
Oh. Oh!

1:24:02.412 --> 1:24:03.997
You're kidding me.

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:08.334
No. So, if you are
good and worthy,

1:24:08.418 --> 1:24:09.919
then she'll see that.

1:24:10.003 --> 1:24:13.840
But if, on the other hand,
you're cruel and deceitful,

1:24:13.923 --> 1:24:15.884
then she'll know that too.

1:24:16.634 --> 1:24:17.969
Oh, yeah?

1:24:18.052 --> 1:24:20.805
Does she just
tell you that or...

1:24:21.723 --> 1:24:23.057
Not exactly tells.

1:24:23.141 --> 1:24:24.642
Well, she bows,

1:24:24.726 --> 1:24:27.937
but only in the presence of
someone truly pure of heart.

1:24:29.898 --> 1:24:31.483
I mean, almost none of us are,
of course,

1:24:31.566 --> 1:24:35.153
no matter how good of a person
one tries to be.

1:24:35.236 --> 1:24:38.323
There was actually a time,
many, many years ago,

1:24:38.406 --> 1:24:40.992
when the Qilin chose
who'd lead us.

1:24:42.911 --> 1:24:44.037
No...

1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.332
-Whoa. Woop. Whoa...

1:24:48.792 --> 1:24:51.127
Okay.
All right, already.

1:24:54.005 --> 1:24:55.048
Here you go.

1:24:56.299 --> 1:24:57.258
Thriving.

1:24:57.342 --> 1:24:58.635
He's just hungry.

1:24:58.718 --> 1:25:00.011
-Look at him.
-She really likes you,

1:25:00.094 --> 1:25:00.804
-Jacob.
-Oh, all right.

1:25:04.265 --> 1:25:05.308
It's okay.

1:25:14.776 --> 1:25:16.236
Come with me.

1:25:17.862 --> 1:25:19.364
I'll help you.

1:25:21.115 --> 1:25:23.243
He's your son, Aberforth.

1:25:26.037 --> 1:25:27.622
He needs you.

1:25:40.802 --> 1:25:41.970
Newt.

1:25:54.691 --> 1:25:56.192
Come in.

1:25:56.276 --> 1:26:00.196
Albus, the mirror downstairs,
there's a message.

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:01.322
Close the door.

1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.165
It's from Credence, Newt.

1:26:14.168 --> 1:26:17.755
The summer
Gellert and I fell in love,

1:26:17.839 --> 1:26:19.924
my brother
fell in love as well,

1:26:20.008 --> 1:26:22.260
with a girl from the Hollow.

1:26:23.386 --> 1:26:25.054
She was sent away.

1:26:26.681 --> 1:26:29.225
There were rumors
about a child.

1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:32.061
Credence...

1:26:32.145 --> 1:26:33.605
He's a Dumbledore.

1:26:36.733 --> 1:26:39.777
If I'd been a better friend...

1:26:39.861 --> 1:26:42.196
to Aberforth, if I'd been
a better brother...

1:26:43.615 --> 1:26:46.993
he might have confided in me.

1:26:47.076 --> 1:26:50.997
Perhaps things would have been
different, and this boy...

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.208
could have been part of
our lives, part of our family.

1:26:59.714 --> 1:27:04.093
Credence can't be saved,
I know you know that.

1:27:04.177 --> 1:27:07.847
But he may yet
be able to save us.

1:27:14.228 --> 1:27:16.314
Phoenix ash.

1:27:16.397 --> 1:27:19.984
The bird comes to him
because he's dying, Newt.

1:27:21.027 --> 1:27:22.737
I know the signs.

1:27:23.571 --> 1:27:24.948
You see...

1:27:26.699 --> 1:27:30.662
my sister was an Obscurial.

1:27:30.745 --> 1:27:34.123
And like Credence, she never
learned to express her magic.

1:27:35.375 --> 1:27:39.629
Over time it grew darker
and began to poison her.

1:27:39.712 --> 1:27:43.341
Worst of all, none of us were
capable of easing her pain.

1:27:46.886 --> 1:27:49.722
Can you tell me
how it is that...

1:27:49.806 --> 1:27:51.891
or how it came
to an end for her?

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:58.564
Gellert and I had made plans
to go away together.

1:28:00.066 --> 1:28:03.277
My brother didn't approve.

1:28:03.361 --> 1:28:05.947
One night, he confronted us.

1:28:06.030 --> 1:28:08.491
Voices were raised,
threats made.

1:28:08.574 --> 1:28:12.203
Aberforth drew his wand,
which was foolish.

1:28:14.747 --> 1:28:18.209
I drew my wand,
which was even more foolish.

1:28:20.628 --> 1:28:23.548
Gellert just laughed.

1:28:23.631 --> 1:28:26.467
No one heard
Ariana coming down the stairs.

1:28:29.429 --> 1:28:31.931
Can't say for certain
it was my...

1:28:33.516 --> 1:28:34.517
spell.

1:28:39.605 --> 1:28:41.899
Doesn't really matter.

1:28:41.983 --> 1:28:43.693
One minute she was there,

1:28:43.776 --> 1:28:45.987
and the next she was gone.

1:28:46.988 --> 1:28:48.823
I'm so sorry, Albus.

1:28:50.992 --> 1:28:52.326
But if it's of any comfort,

1:28:52.410 --> 1:28:54.579
perhaps she was saved
some pain...

1:28:54.662 --> 1:28:56.205
Don't.

1:28:56.289 --> 1:28:58.332
Don't disappoint me, Newt.

1:28:59.459 --> 1:29:01.210
You of all people.

1:29:02.503 --> 1:29:04.881
Your honesty is a gift...

1:29:06.966 --> 1:29:09.594
even if at times
a painful one.

1:29:14.348 --> 1:29:17.727
Our friends downstairs will be
tired and wanting to go home.

1:29:17.810 --> 1:29:20.104
You should... You should go.

1:29:34.118 --> 1:29:37.330
Albus,
Lally said something earlier

1:29:37.413 --> 1:29:41.709
about most of us
being ultimately imperfect.

1:29:41.793 --> 1:29:45.922
But even if we make mistakes,
terrible things...

1:29:47.381 --> 1:29:50.051
we can try
to make things right.

1:29:52.553 --> 1:29:54.263
And that's what matters...

1:29:57.934 --> 1:29:59.477
trying.

1:30:15.409 --> 1:30:16.661
We're with you.

1:30:17.328 --> 1:30:18.496
Thank you.

1:30:26.879 --> 1:30:29.757
Our time is close,
my brothers and sisters.

1:30:30.758 --> 1:30:32.677
Days of hiding are over.

1:30:35.179 --> 1:30:37.640
The world will hear our voice.

1:30:40.893 --> 1:30:42.436
And it will be deafening.

1:30:50.486 --> 1:30:53.531
You didn't come here
to betray Dumbledore.

1:30:54.657 --> 1:30:57.451
You know
in your pure-blood heart,

1:30:59.036 --> 1:31:01.038
your place is here.

1:31:03.082 --> 1:31:06.002
To believe in me
is to believe in yourself.

1:31:18.306 --> 1:31:20.725
Prove your loyalty, Mr. Kama.

1:31:43.414 --> 1:31:45.791
...Vulnera Sanentur.

1:31:45.875 --> 1:31:50.963
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1:31:51.047 --> 1:31:56.135
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1:31:58.179 --> 1:32:03.851
Rennervate Vulnera Sanentur.

1:32:08.731 --> 1:32:09.690
There.

1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:12.818
There, there.

1:32:14.862 --> 1:32:16.113
There.

1:32:18.324 --> 1:32:19.700
Come, look.

1:32:23.537 --> 1:32:25.414
Hmm.

1:32:25.498 --> 1:32:27.667
This is why we are special.

1:32:30.711 --> 1:32:31.963
To conceal our powers

1:32:32.046 --> 1:32:34.548
is not merely
an affront to ourselves...

1:32:36.133 --> 1:32:37.510
it's sinful.

1:32:52.066 --> 1:32:53.734
Was there another?

1:32:54.902 --> 1:32:56.195
Another?

1:32:57.363 --> 1:33:00.366
That night,
was there another Qilin?

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:05.329
I don't think so...

1:33:07.081 --> 1:33:08.582
That's twice you failed me.

1:33:08.666 --> 1:33:12.670
Do you not understand
the danger you put me in?

1:33:16.465 --> 1:33:18.759
One last chance.

1:33:18.843 --> 1:33:20.052
Understood?

1:33:23.264 --> 1:33:24.348
Find it.

1:34:18.903 --> 1:34:20.446
Hey, Newt.

1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:22.907
What is this place?

1:34:23.824 --> 1:34:25.910
The room we require.

1:34:30.164 --> 1:34:31.999
I trust you all have
the tickets

1:34:32.083 --> 1:34:33.751
that Bunty gave you?

1:34:33.834 --> 1:34:36.420
You'll need them to
gain access to the ceremony.

1:34:36.504 --> 1:34:37.588
What do you think, Newt?

1:34:37.671 --> 1:34:39.298
Can you tell
which one is yours?

1:34:39.382 --> 1:34:40.966
No.

1:34:41.050 --> 1:34:42.885
Good.
I'd be worried if you could.

1:34:42.968 --> 1:34:45.388
I assume the Qilin's
in one of these cases.

1:34:45.471 --> 1:34:46.764
Yes.

1:34:46.847 --> 1:34:48.766
-Well, which one is it?
-Which one indeed.

1:34:48.849 --> 1:34:51.185
Ooh, it's like
a three-card monte thing.

1:34:51.268 --> 1:34:53.145
Like a shell game thing.

1:34:53.229 --> 1:34:54.397
Like a short con.

1:34:56.273 --> 1:34:58.150
Never mind,
it's a Muggle thing.

1:34:58.234 --> 1:35:00.653
Grindelwald will do anything
within his powers

1:35:00.736 --> 1:35:03.072
to get his hands
on our rare friend.

1:35:03.155 --> 1:35:05.408
Therefore,
it's essential that we keep

1:35:05.491 --> 1:35:09.120
whoever he dispatches
on his behalf guessing,

1:35:09.203 --> 1:35:12.289
so the Qilin gets
to the ceremony safely.

1:35:12.373 --> 1:35:17.878
If, by teatime, the Qilin,
not to mention all of us,

1:35:18.754 --> 1:35:20.464
are still alive,

1:35:20.548 --> 1:35:23.467
we should consider
our efforts a success.

1:35:23.551 --> 1:35:25.052
For the record,
nobody ever died

1:35:25.136 --> 1:35:27.012
playing three-card monte.

1:35:28.722 --> 1:35:31.392
An important distinction.

1:35:31.475 --> 1:35:32.810
All right,
everybody choose a case

1:35:32.893 --> 1:35:34.311
and we'll be on our way.

1:35:34.395 --> 1:35:38.149
Mr. Kowalski, you and I
will proceed together first.

1:35:39.024 --> 1:35:40.025
Me?

1:35:44.572 --> 1:35:45.739
Okay.

1:36:10.431 --> 1:36:12.516
I'm looking forward to you
educating me a little further

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:15.478
on the finer points
of three-card monte.

1:36:17.605 --> 1:36:18.647
Mm.

1:36:21.275 --> 1:36:22.735
My pleasure.

1:36:26.071 --> 1:36:27.698
Well...

1:36:27.781 --> 1:36:29.825
Good luck, everybody.

1:36:32.495 --> 1:36:33.537
Good luck.

1:36:34.705 --> 1:36:37.500
And you too, Bunty girl.

1:36:40.294 --> 1:36:41.795
See you, Bunty.

1:36:56.143 --> 1:36:58.479
It is not lost
on those of us in leadership

1:36:58.562 --> 1:37:02.525
that we are currently
a world divided.

1:37:02.608 --> 1:37:06.320
Each day brings
talk of another conspiracy.

1:37:06.403 --> 1:37:08.906
Each hour
another dark whisper.

1:37:08.989 --> 1:37:12.868
These whispers have
only increased in recent days,

1:37:12.952 --> 1:37:16.413
with the addition
of a third candidate.

1:37:16.497 --> 1:37:20.751
There is only one way
to leave absolutely no doubt

1:37:21.669 --> 1:37:23.254
that a worthy candidate exists

1:37:23.337 --> 1:37:27.007
amongst the three
you have been presented.

1:37:45.401 --> 1:37:49.488
As every schoolboy
and girl knows,

1:37:49.572 --> 1:37:54.118
the Qilin
is the purest of creatures

1:37:54.201 --> 1:37:56.787
in our wonderful
magical world.

1:37:56.870 --> 1:37:58.747
It cannot be deceived.

1:38:00.291 --> 1:38:02.960
Let the Qilin unite us.

1:38:23.188 --> 1:38:25.149
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:38:25.232 --> 1:38:26.442
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:38:33.365 --> 1:38:35.909
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:38:37.411 --> 1:38:39.079
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:38:51.383 --> 1:38:52.384
Come.

1:38:56.180 --> 1:38:58.098
-Where to, next?

1:38:58.182 --> 1:39:00.517
Uh, this is where I leave you.

1:39:00.601 --> 1:39:02.978
I'm... I'm sorry, you're what?

1:39:03.062 --> 1:39:04.355
Leaving me?

1:39:04.438 --> 1:39:07.691
I have to meet someone else,
Mr. Kowalski.

1:39:07.775 --> 1:39:09.068
Not to worry,

1:39:09.943 --> 1:39:11.487
you'll be perfectly safe.

1:39:15.449 --> 1:39:17.660
You don't have the Qilin.

1:39:17.743 --> 1:39:21.330
Feel free to drop the case
at the first hint of trouble.

1:39:21.413 --> 1:39:24.583
One other thing,
if you don't mind me saying.

1:39:24.667 --> 1:39:27.044
You should
stop doubting yourself.

1:39:27.127 --> 1:39:30.214
You have something most men
go their entire lives without.

1:39:30.297 --> 1:39:31.799
Do you know what that is?

1:39:33.342 --> 1:39:36.345
A heart that is full.

1:39:36.428 --> 1:39:38.305
Only a truly brave man

1:39:38.389 --> 1:39:42.434
could open himself up
so honestly and completely,

1:39:42.518 --> 1:39:43.560
as you do.

1:40:12.005 --> 1:40:13.799
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:40:13.882 --> 1:40:16.719
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:40:16.802 --> 1:40:19.972
Santos! Santos! Santos!

1:41:26.955 --> 1:41:29.833
Cases, please.

1:41:48.977 --> 1:41:50.020
Hey, fellas.

1:41:54.525 --> 1:41:55.567
Woo-hoo-hoo.

1:41:58.612 --> 1:41:59.822
He's angry.

1:42:15.671 --> 1:42:18.841
Wait. Open them,
make sure it's in there.

1:42:18.924 --> 1:42:19.883
Idiots.

1:44:05.697 --> 1:44:07.240
How long does he have?

1:44:48.490 --> 1:44:50.534
Here. Hey. Hi.

1:44:50.617 --> 1:44:51.868
You're in danger, all right?

1:44:51.952 --> 1:44:53.578
-You need to leave.
-Well...

1:44:54.705 --> 1:44:57.207
I can't... I can't go, okay?

1:44:57.290 --> 1:44:58.625
I can't come home.

1:44:58.709 --> 1:45:00.002
It's too late for me,
all right?

1:45:00.085 --> 1:45:02.754
Some mistakes,
they're just too big.

1:45:02.838 --> 1:45:04.506
-Can you listen to me?

1:45:04.589 --> 1:45:07.426
There's no time.
I was followed.

1:45:07.509 --> 1:45:08.760
I gave 'em the slip,

1:45:08.844 --> 1:45:10.554
but it won't be long
before they find me.

1:45:10.637 --> 1:45:12.264
-They're gonna find us.
-I don't care.

1:45:13.473 --> 1:45:14.933
All I got is us.

1:45:15.017 --> 1:45:16.435
I make no sense without us.

1:45:16.518 --> 1:45:19.312
Jacob, what? Come on...

1:45:19.396 --> 1:45:21.356
I don't love you anymore.
Just get outta here.

1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:23.942
You're the worst liar in
the world, Queenie Goldstein.

1:45:25.610 --> 1:45:26.737
You hear that?

1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:28.280
What? No.

1:45:28.363 --> 1:45:29.948
That's a sign.

1:45:30.032 --> 1:45:31.158
Oh, man.

1:45:31.241 --> 1:45:33.535
-Oh, come on.
-Come here, come here.

1:45:33.618 --> 1:45:34.995
Close your eyes.

1:45:35.871 --> 1:45:37.789
Please close your eyes.

1:45:39.332 --> 1:45:41.334
You know
what Dumbledore said to me?

1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:43.378
No.

1:45:43.462 --> 1:45:45.922
He said
that I got a full heart.

1:45:50.010 --> 1:45:51.887
He's wrong.

1:45:51.970 --> 1:45:54.681
I'm always gonna have room
in there for you.

1:45:56.016 --> 1:45:57.225
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:45:57.309 --> 1:45:58.602
You know it.

1:45:59.728 --> 1:46:01.021
Look at me.

1:46:03.857 --> 1:46:05.525
Queenie Goldstein.

1:47:11.633 --> 1:47:13.009
Mr. Scamander.

1:47:13.093 --> 1:47:15.011
We've never been
properly introduced.

1:47:15.095 --> 1:47:17.973
Henrietta Fischer,

1:47:18.056 --> 1:47:19.641
Herr Vogel's attache.

1:47:19.724 --> 1:47:21.726
Ah. Yes, uh,

1:47:21.810 --> 1:47:22.727
hello.

1:47:22.811 --> 1:47:25.480
I can take you up.

1:47:25.564 --> 1:47:28.775
There's a private entrance for
members of the High Council.

1:47:29.776 --> 1:47:31.528
If you just follow me.

1:47:31.611 --> 1:47:33.363
I'm sorry,
why would you do that?

1:47:34.030 --> 1:47:35.866
Take me up?

1:47:35.949 --> 1:47:38.201
Isn't it obvious?

1:47:38.285 --> 1:47:41.204
No, frankly, it's, uh, not.

1:47:45.417 --> 1:47:47.419
Dumbledore sent me.

1:47:49.337 --> 1:47:53.258
I know what you have
in that case, Mr. Scamander.

1:48:14.738 --> 1:48:16.656
He should be here
any minute.

1:49:20.428 --> 1:49:21.888
What kept you?

1:49:36.278 --> 1:49:39.114
I thank the candidates
for their words.

1:49:39.197 --> 1:49:42.409
Each represents
a distinct vision

1:49:42.492 --> 1:49:45.328
of how we will not shape
only our world,

1:49:45.412 --> 1:49:48.039
but the non-magical world
as well.

1:49:49.374 --> 1:49:50.959
Which brings us

1:49:51.042 --> 1:49:54.546
to the most important part
of our ceremony,

1:49:54.629 --> 1:49:56.840
the walk of the Qilin.

1:51:26.346 --> 1:51:28.640
The Qilin has seen.

1:51:29.682 --> 1:51:31.434
Seen goodness,

1:51:31.518 --> 1:51:33.436
strength,

1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:38.358
qualities essential to lead
and to guide us.

1:51:40.527 --> 1:51:42.779
Who do you see?

1:51:58.545 --> 1:52:02.799
Gellert Grindelwald is the new
leader of the magical world

1:52:02.882 --> 1:52:04.592
by acclamation.

1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:46.759
This is the man
who tried to take my life.

1:52:47.802 --> 1:52:52.640
This man, who has no magic,

1:52:52.724 --> 1:52:55.935
who would marry a witch
and pollute our blood,

1:52:56.019 --> 1:53:00.023
create a forbidden union
that would make us less,

1:53:00.106 --> 1:53:02.233
make us weak, like his kind.

1:53:04.194 --> 1:53:05.987
He's not alone, my friends.

1:53:07.322 --> 1:53:10.575
There are thousands
who seek to do the same.

1:53:12.118 --> 1:53:15.705
There can only be one response
to such vermin.

1:53:25.256 --> 1:53:26.466
No.

1:53:29.969 --> 1:53:31.471
-Crucio.

1:53:31.554 --> 1:53:32.972
No!

1:53:35.141 --> 1:53:37.227
Make him stop!

1:53:37.310 --> 1:53:42.440
Our war with the Muggles
begins today.

1:53:59.999 --> 1:54:01.584
-Jacob.

1:54:41.749 --> 1:54:43.710
He's lying to you.

1:54:46.296 --> 1:54:48.590
That creature is dead.

1:54:55.722 --> 1:54:58.141
-Not now. Wait.

1:55:02.770 --> 1:55:04.314
He did it to trick you.

1:55:04.397 --> 1:55:07.108
He killed it and bewitched it

1:55:07.191 --> 1:55:10.111
so that you might think him
worthy to lead.

1:55:12.405 --> 1:55:14.657
But he doesn't want
to lead you.

1:55:17.118 --> 1:55:19.245
He just wants you to follow.

1:55:19.996 --> 1:55:21.164
Words.

1:55:22.540 --> 1:55:25.335
Words designed to deceive.

1:55:25.418 --> 1:55:27.670
To make you doubt what you've
seen with your own two eyes.

1:55:27.754 --> 1:55:29.464
There were two Qilins
born that night.

1:55:29.547 --> 1:55:31.841
A twin.
And I know that...

1:55:33.343 --> 1:55:34.385
I know that...

1:55:34.469 --> 1:55:35.595
Because?

1:55:39.849 --> 1:55:42.852
Because you have no proof.

1:55:42.935 --> 1:55:45.146
Because there was
no second Qilin.

1:55:46.439 --> 1:55:47.732
Am I not right?

1:55:47.815 --> 1:55:49.108
Its mother
had been killed, it...

1:55:49.192 --> 1:55:51.736
Then where is it now,
Mr. Scamander?

1:56:17.470 --> 1:56:19.722
No one can know
everything, Newt.

1:56:19.806 --> 1:56:21.057
Remember?

1:56:51.379 --> 1:56:52.797
I don't get it.

1:57:04.851 --> 1:57:07.270
She can't hear you,
little one.

1:57:08.813 --> 1:57:10.273
Not here...

1:57:11.899 --> 1:57:14.485
but perhaps somewhere
she's listening.

1:57:18.072 --> 1:57:20.366
This is the true Qilin.

1:57:21.617 --> 1:57:23.161
Look at it,

1:57:23.244 --> 1:57:25.413
you can see it
with your own eyes.

1:57:25.496 --> 1:57:27.665
-This is the true...

1:57:32.211 --> 1:57:34.672
This can't be allowed
to stand.

1:57:34.756 --> 1:57:37.175
The vote must be taken again.

1:57:37.258 --> 1:57:40.052
Come on, Anton. Do something.

1:58:08.372 --> 1:58:09.999
You...

1:58:10.082 --> 1:58:11.918
No, no, no, please.

1:58:37.318 --> 1:58:40.029
I'm honored.

1:58:40.112 --> 1:58:43.282
But just as two of you
were born that night,

1:58:43.366 --> 1:58:46.828
there's another here,
equally worthy.

1:58:48.246 --> 1:58:50.122
I'm certain of it.

1:59:05.638 --> 1:59:06.973
Thank you.

2:01:59.437 --> 2:02:01.522
Who will love you now,
Dumbledore?

2:02:04.525 --> 2:02:06.068
You're all alone.

2:02:56.535 --> 2:02:58.537
I was never your enemy.

2:03:05.753 --> 2:03:08.589
Then, or now.

2:03:49.380 --> 2:03:51.465
Did you ever think of me?

2:03:54.093 --> 2:03:55.386
Always.

2:04:02.768 --> 2:04:04.145
Come home.

2:04:52.610 --> 2:04:54.445
-Here she is.

2:04:56.030 --> 2:04:57.656
Well done, Bunty.

2:05:01.660 --> 2:05:03.996
Come on, little one.

2:05:04.079 --> 2:05:06.916
I'm sorry. I must have
given you an awful fright.

2:05:06.999 --> 2:05:08.209
No, I think, um,

2:05:08.292 --> 2:05:09.919
sometimes it takes
losing something

2:05:10.002 --> 2:05:12.421
to realize
quite how much it means.

2:05:15.299 --> 2:05:17.468
And sometimes you just...

2:05:20.971 --> 2:05:23.432
Sometimes you just know.

2:05:33.192 --> 2:05:35.361
-Right, in you pop.

2:05:37.571 --> 2:05:39.657
Mr. Kowalski.

2:05:41.033 --> 2:05:43.077
I owe you an apology.

2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:44.787
It... It was never my intent

2:05:44.870 --> 2:05:47.623
for you to suffer
the Cruciatus curse.

2:05:48.666 --> 2:05:50.084
Yeah...

2:05:50.167 --> 2:05:52.294
Well, you know, we got Queenie
back, so we're square.

2:05:52.378 --> 2:05:55.214
Hey, can I ask you a question?

2:05:55.297 --> 2:05:56.840
-Can I keep this?

2:05:56.924 --> 2:05:58.717
For, like, old times' sake?

2:06:01.053 --> 2:06:04.890
I can't think of anyone
more deserving.

2:06:07.184 --> 2:06:08.769
Thanks, Professor.

2:06:29.498 --> 2:06:31.333
-Remarkable.
-But how?

2:06:31.417 --> 2:06:33.085
I thought you couldn't
move against one another.

2:06:33.168 --> 2:06:34.920
We didn't.

2:06:35.004 --> 2:06:37.965
He sought to kill,
I sought to protect.

2:06:38.048 --> 2:06:39.925
Our spells met.

2:06:41.427 --> 2:06:44.388
Let's call it fate.

2:06:44.471 --> 2:06:48.100
After all, how else
will we fulfill our destinies?

2:06:49.935 --> 2:06:51.228
Albus.

2:06:52.980 --> 2:06:54.606
Promise me.

2:06:56.734 --> 2:06:58.944
You'll find him
and you'll stop him.

2:07:26.513 --> 2:07:29.600
Albert,
don't forget the pierogis.

2:07:29.683 --> 2:07:31.060
Yes, Mr. K.

2:07:31.143 --> 2:07:32.603
Albert.

2:07:32.686 --> 2:07:35.439
No more than eight minutes
on the kolaczkis.

2:07:35.522 --> 2:07:36.940
Yes, Mr. K.

2:07:37.024 --> 2:07:38.484
He's a sweet kid.
He doesn't know

2:07:38.567 --> 2:07:40.694
the difference between
paszteciki and golabki.

2:07:40.778 --> 2:07:42.071
-Hey, sweetheart.
-What?

2:07:42.154 --> 2:07:43.530
Newt doesn't know
what you're talking about.

2:07:43.614 --> 2:07:44.907
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2:07:44.990 --> 2:07:47.910
And you are not working today,
remember?

2:07:47.993 --> 2:07:49.578
-Oh!

2:07:49.661 --> 2:07:51.372
Oh, are you all right, honey?

2:07:51.455 --> 2:07:53.582
Oh, you're nervous about
the speech. Don't be nervous.

2:07:53.665 --> 2:07:54.666
Tell him, honey.

2:07:54.750 --> 2:07:55.918
Don't be nervous
about the speech.

2:07:56.001 --> 2:07:57.294
-I'm not nervous.

2:07:57.378 --> 2:07:58.962
What is the smell?
Why is there burning?

2:07:59.046 --> 2:08:00.464
-Albert?

2:08:02.883 --> 2:08:06.136
Mm. Maybe we're nervous
about something else, huh?

2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:08.597
I can't imagine
what you're talking about.

2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:09.807
Mm-hmm.

2:08:22.986 --> 2:08:25.072
So, the day
that I first met Jacob...

2:08:25.155 --> 2:08:26.240
Uh...

2:08:26.323 --> 2:08:27.783
The day
that I first met Jacob,

2:08:27.866 --> 2:08:30.035
we were both sitting
in the Steen National Bank.

2:08:31.787 --> 2:08:33.080
Never would I...

2:08:47.553 --> 2:08:49.596
The maid of honor, I presume?

2:08:51.515 --> 2:08:53.934
The best man, I gather?

2:08:55.644 --> 2:08:57.020
You've done something
to your hair.

2:08:57.104 --> 2:08:58.105
No.

2:08:58.814 --> 2:08:59.815
Oh.

2:09:01.275 --> 2:09:03.610
Well, yes, actually, just...

2:09:03.694 --> 2:09:04.820
Just for tonight.

2:09:04.903 --> 2:09:06.488
-Well, it suits you.
-Thank you, Newt.

2:09:11.118 --> 2:09:12.077
Oh.

2:09:12.161 --> 2:09:13.370
-Hello.
-Hi.

2:09:13.454 --> 2:09:14.997
Look who's...

2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:16.081
Hi.

2:09:17.166 --> 2:09:19.001
So good to see you.

2:09:19.084 --> 2:09:20.586
-Hi.
-How are you?

2:09:20.669 --> 2:09:21.837
You look wonderful, Lally.

2:09:21.920 --> 2:09:24.173
Well, thank you, Newt.
I appreciate it.

2:09:24.256 --> 2:09:25.257
Good luck.

2:09:25.340 --> 2:09:26.758
Tina, come on.
You must tell me

2:09:26.842 --> 2:09:28.844
-how MACUSA's been.
-See you inside.

2:09:34.475 --> 2:09:36.685
-What about me? How do I look?

2:09:36.768 --> 2:09:38.228
-You all right?
-You look fine.

2:09:38.312 --> 2:09:40.397
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

2:09:40.481 --> 2:09:41.940
You're not nervous, are you?

2:09:43.192 --> 2:09:44.359
Can't be nervous
about a speech

2:09:44.443 --> 2:09:46.320
after saving the world. Hmm.

2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:06.089
It's a historic day.

2:10:06.173 --> 2:10:10.928
Where once was before,
there will now be after.

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:16.225
Funny how historic days
seem so ordinary

2:10:16.308 --> 2:10:18.519
when you're living them.

2:10:18.602 --> 2:10:19.853
Well, perhaps
that's what happens

2:10:19.937 --> 2:10:21.396
when the world
gets things right.

2:10:21.480 --> 2:10:24.441
Mm, it's jolly nice to know
it happens occasionally.

2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:31.114
I didn't know
if I'd see you here.

2:10:31.198 --> 2:10:32.699
I wasn't sure
you would, either.

2:10:32.783 --> 2:10:34.201
-Hey, Newt.

2:10:34.284 --> 2:10:35.494
Yes.

2:10:35.577 --> 2:10:37.329
Jacob seems to think
he's lost the ring.

2:10:37.412 --> 2:10:38.539
Please tell me you've got it.

2:10:38.622 --> 2:10:40.582
No, it's all good. Yep.

2:10:40.666 --> 2:10:41.917
Whew.

2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:43.627
-That scared me. Jacob!

2:10:46.421 --> 2:10:47.548
Good man, Pick.

2:10:52.761 --> 2:10:54.304
I should probably, um...

2:10:56.014 --> 2:10:57.224
Thank you, Newt.

2:10:58.809 --> 2:10:59.935
What for?

2:11:00.018 --> 2:11:01.562
Pick your poison.

2:11:03.605 --> 2:11:06.358
I really couldn't have done it
without you.

2:11:13.156 --> 2:11:15.659
I'd do it again,
by the way.

2:11:17.411 --> 2:11:18.996
Should you ask.

2:11:34.344 --> 2:11:35.345
Okay.

2:11:37.598 --> 2:11:38.640
Hey.

2:11:49.860 --> 2:11:50.777
-Hey!
-Hello!

2:11:50.861 --> 2:11:53.030
Bunty!

2:11:53.113 --> 2:11:54.656
Bunty!

2:12:14.426 --> 2:12:17.554
Wow, you're so beautiful.

2:12:23.143 --> 2:12:24.269
Oh.

2:12:25.103 --> 2:12:27.230
I can't believe it.

2:12:47.793 --> 2:12:49.378
This is, um...
This is Albert.

2:12:49.461 --> 2:12:51.088
I don't know
if you've met Albert, yet?

2:12:51.171 --> 2:12:52.631
Have you met Lally?
