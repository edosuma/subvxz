00:01.143 --> 00:02.659
<i>Previously...</i>

00:04.506 --> 00:05.606
Hi, Charlie.

00:06.979 --> 00:09.342
You should know I didn't come over
to ruin your date.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.927
Why did you come over?

00:11.095 --> 00:13.095
To tell you
that I'm getting married.

00:13.956 --> 00:17.058
- Today's the big day.
- Oh, please. There's no wedding.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.026
Would it make a difference, knowing

00:19.151 --> 00:22.292
that cute little face will never pop up
over that railing again?

00:22.417 --> 00:25.567
That the one woman who's always
loved you and been there for you

00:25.988 --> 00:27.688
is forever out of reach?

00:28.498 --> 00:30.447
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

00:30.906 --> 00:33.283
To the church. To prove to you
she's not getting married.

00:33.957 --> 00:36.207
Look. Tell me if you see a wedding.

00:38.735 --> 00:39.872
I see a wedding.

00:45.202 --> 00:46.379
She's doing it.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.855
Let him speak now,
or forever hold his peace.

00:51.486 --> 00:52.786
And we're clear.

00:54.338 --> 00:55.838
That ought to do it.

00:55.963 --> 00:57.263
Thanks, Freddie.

01:01.723 --> 01:03.893
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe.

01:04.334 --> 01:06.232
Catch a tiger...

01:06.400 --> 01:08.550
Who am I kidding? I love you all.

01:11.246 --> 01:13.198
Let's see. What else do we need?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.373
Right. Ice.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.158
Water in a useful form.

01:20.519 --> 01:22.019
Everybody all right?

01:25.167 --> 01:26.717
What a nice surprise.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.839
- How are you?
- Good. Good. You look great.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.008
Thank you.
Married life agrees with me.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.886
That's right. Congratulations!
So where are you living now?

01:35.054 --> 01:37.013
Manny and I moved
into my beach house.

01:37.181 --> 01:40.349
So we'll be neighbors again.
I'll have to come by sometime.

01:40.518 --> 01:42.162
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:42.287 --> 01:44.512
The old boyfriend
meeting the new husband.

01:44.637 --> 01:45.688
It's awkward.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.159
I guess you're right.

01:47.284 --> 01:49.338
I've never been that popular
with husbands.

01:50.237 --> 01:51.287
Or fathers.

01:51.485 --> 01:52.485
Or boyfriends.

01:52.589 --> 01:53.589
Sons.

01:53.632 --> 01:55.332
Surly lesbian roommates.

01:56.397 --> 01:57.397
You're happy?

01:57.493 --> 01:59.579
More than I ever dreamed possible.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.523
You know what he said to me
the other day?

02:01.648 --> 02:04.748
Without me at his side,
he might as well not exist.

02:08.269 --> 02:10.253
That's a little gay, but all right.

02:10.871 --> 02:13.507
What about you?
Anyone special in your life?

02:14.324 --> 02:16.753
Not really. I mean, there's gals
with special skills,

02:16.878 --> 02:18.346
but I got to pay extra.

02:19.002 --> 02:21.557
You should find someone who loves you
the way Manny loves me.

02:21.726 --> 02:24.685
The love is the same.
It's just at an hourly rate.

02:25.272 --> 02:26.938
Don't grow old alone, Charlie.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

02:36.501 --> 02:38.101
What is it with women?

02:38.576 --> 02:42.203
They go off and get married, and all
of a sudden seem a lot more beautiful.

02:43.661 --> 02:45.211
No matter, MacTavich.

02:45.927 --> 02:47.677
We can grow old together.

02:49.495 --> 02:51.295
After all, you're only 20.

02:52.076 --> 02:54.176
But I doubt you're gonna see 21.

03:24.795 --> 03:25.795
Is it on?

03:26.612 --> 03:27.662
I think so.

03:28.210 --> 03:29.642
All right, let's do this.

03:30.322 --> 03:32.931
I'm Jake Harper,
and this is the Human Volcano.

03:33.491 --> 03:36.097
We begin by drinking
a warm can of Diet Coke.

03:36.894 --> 03:38.438
That's not Coke, dude.

03:38.721 --> 03:40.263
My dad did the shopping.

03:40.897 --> 03:43.047
Anyway, a warm diet cola product.

03:55.187 --> 03:57.287
And now I will swallow a Mentos.

03:57.733 --> 03:58.733
Mentos.

04:02.550 --> 04:04.109
Now I will lay on the floor.

04:06.523 --> 04:07.523
Goggles.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.090
Safety first.

04:11.190 --> 04:12.435
You feel anything yet?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.184
It's working.

04:14.309 --> 04:17.483
If it starts coming out the back door,
pull your pants down and roll over.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.260
Good thinking.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.743
- What's going on?
- Not a good time, Dad.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.219
What are you doing on the floor?

04:27.394 --> 04:28.399
Awesome!

04:29.750 --> 04:31.020
What are you doing?

04:31.464 --> 04:33.398
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

04:33.804 --> 04:35.692
We were just making a video.
Hold on.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.752
Cool stunts.

04:42.019 --> 04:43.072
Cool stunts?

04:43.197 --> 04:44.579
In God's name, why?

04:44.828 --> 04:46.248
You've heard of Jackass?

04:47.092 --> 04:48.342
We are Dumbass.

04:50.892 --> 04:51.892
Really?

04:53.375 --> 04:55.295
However did you come up
with that name?

04:55.885 --> 04:58.840
Well, we were thinking
"What's better than Jackass?"

04:59.009 --> 05:01.342
That's kind of
a rhetorical question.

05:01.512 --> 05:02.970
No. It wasn't that hard.

05:04.718 --> 05:08.183
It came down to a choice
between Dumbass and The Asskateers.

05:08.595 --> 05:10.935
- I think you made the right call.
- Really?

05:11.187 --> 05:13.137
Yes. I applaud your decision.

05:14.983 --> 05:18.485
The plan is, we shoot cool stunts,
post them, and then sell advertising.

05:18.965 --> 05:21.414
Who on earth
would advertise on that?

05:21.782 --> 05:24.699
Well, right off the bat,
we figure Coke and Mentos.

05:26.202 --> 05:28.203
It's a product placement bonanza.

05:29.974 --> 05:32.316
Come on,
let's go upload our premiere episode.

05:33.549 --> 05:35.099
What about this mess?

05:37.007 --> 05:38.007
Damn it.

05:39.674 --> 05:42.215
I'm gonna be taking care of that kid
till I'm 90.

05:43.174 --> 05:45.279
Please, God,
don't make me live that long.

05:48.237 --> 05:50.721
You'll never guess
who I ran into at the supermarket.

05:51.436 --> 05:53.186
She's back from her honeymoon?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.814
And living down
the beach with her new husband.

05:56.391 --> 05:57.494
Good for her.

05:59.547 --> 06:00.604
Good for her.

06:02.441 --> 06:04.072
You have to forget about her.

06:04.438 --> 06:05.438
I know.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.786
That's why I got me
some milk of amnesia.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.536
Nice.

06:11.019 --> 06:12.288
What are you doing?

06:12.859 --> 06:15.709
Wiping up cola vomit
my son spewed in my face.

06:17.174 --> 06:19.274
Great. The Human Volcano worked!

06:20.362 --> 06:22.606
- You knew about this?
- It was my idea.

06:23.260 --> 06:24.471
You're kidding.

06:24.596 --> 06:26.845
It'll make a great first episode
of The Asskateers.

06:27.478 --> 06:29.514
Actually,
I think they went with Dumbass.

06:30.797 --> 06:33.393
Damn. I already had
a bunch of t-shirts made up.

06:33.603 --> 06:34.802
What can I say?

06:35.355 --> 06:38.398
You got to like that your son's got
a little entrepreneurial spirit.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.358
Thanks for showing me
the bright side.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.650
No problem.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.180
Memory wipe?

06:45.672 --> 06:46.906
I think I will.

07:09.278 --> 07:11.318
Looking for Japanese subs, Cap'n?

07:13.117 --> 07:14.976
I'm just trying out
these new binoculars.

07:15.304 --> 07:17.145
You're spying on Rose, aren't you?

07:17.313 --> 07:20.231
It's not spying. It's...
Shut up and leave me alone.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.804
You said you were gonna forget her.

07:22.929 --> 07:25.086
You said you were gonna move out
after a few days.

07:26.376 --> 07:27.973
Don't change the subject.

07:28.374 --> 07:30.492
I'm just trying
to get a glimpse of her husband.

07:30.827 --> 07:32.216
That's really sad.

07:32.361 --> 07:35.010
Sadder than throwing your back out
trying to pleasure yourself?

07:36.192 --> 07:37.332
I was doing yoga.

07:38.506 --> 07:40.340
Then why were you wearing lipstick?

07:43.035 --> 07:45.257
And again, don't change the subject.

07:45.985 --> 07:49.191
I am simply curious to see
what kind of guy Rose would marry.

07:49.316 --> 07:51.632
If that's the case,
why don't you just go over there,

07:51.757 --> 07:54.099
knock on the door,
and shake the man's hand?

07:54.267 --> 07:57.393
What would I tell him? "I'm Charlie
Harper. Your wife used to stalk me"?

07:57.562 --> 07:59.161
I might leave that part out.

07:59.286 --> 08:01.606
And besides,
I'm sure he already knows about you.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.919
- How would he know about me?
- Well, it's possible she told him,

08:05.044 --> 08:09.044
or perhaps he noticed the tattoo
of your face on her left butt cheek.

08:09.892 --> 08:11.976
I kind of wish she hadn't done that.

08:12.101 --> 08:15.328
After she takes a hot bath,
I start looking like Edward James Olmos.

08:17.095 --> 08:20.239
Just go over, introduce yourself
and welcome him to the neighborhood.

08:21.594 --> 08:22.922
I guess you're right.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.651
- Bring over a little housewarming gift.
- Now you're talking.

08:27.270 --> 08:28.369
Geronimo!

08:33.869 --> 08:36.275
- Oh, God! Are you all right?
- Mostly.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.749
Did you remember to get it on video?

08:39.337 --> 08:40.337
Crap!

08:51.866 --> 08:54.325
Charlie, what are you doing here?

08:54.494 --> 08:56.536
I thought I'd welcome you guys
to the neighborhood.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.914
This is a bad idea. Please go.

08:59.353 --> 09:01.541
We could open a bottle of wine
and all get to know.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.816
Listen to me.

09:03.049 --> 09:04.223
I love my husband.

09:04.348 --> 09:07.005
I'm building a new life
and I won't let you ruin it.

09:07.174 --> 09:08.381
How could I ruin it?

09:08.824 --> 09:11.509
He doesn't even know you exist,
and I plan on keeping it that way.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.636
How is that possible?
What about the tattoo?

09:13.805 --> 09:16.932
I added glasses to it
and told him it was Harry Potter.

09:19.778 --> 09:21.603
Now, please get out of here.

09:24.191 --> 09:25.191
I'm sorry.

09:27.076 --> 09:29.696
Just so I'm clear,
you and I, we're...?

09:30.155 --> 09:32.027
Over, finished.

09:35.410 --> 09:36.410
I get it.

09:43.414 --> 09:45.014
Told you he'd stop by.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.926
Do you realize how lucky you are?
You could have broken your necks.

09:53.303 --> 09:54.803
We took precautions.

09:59.675 --> 10:01.643
You flew off the roof!

10:03.302 --> 10:04.752
In a shopping cart!

10:07.984 --> 10:09.150
What precautions?

10:09.319 --> 10:11.769
We were planning to land
in the ocean.

10:14.476 --> 10:15.541
You missed it

10:15.666 --> 10:17.153
by 100 yards.

10:19.259 --> 10:21.309
It's not an exact science, Dad.

10:22.142 --> 10:24.290
Let's not dicker over the details.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.792
He said, "dicker".

10:27.987 --> 10:28.987
I know.

10:29.637 --> 10:32.841
I am serious. Okay?
This Dumbass thing stops right now.

10:33.009 --> 10:35.813
You're the one who told me
I should follow my dreams.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.103
I meant dreams like
"doctor" or "lawyer",

10:38.228 --> 10:39.848
not "crash test dummy".

10:42.112 --> 10:45.094
"Dr. Jacob Harper."
I like the sound of that.

10:45.397 --> 10:48.296
Doc, what's this on my nutsack?
Is it infected?

10:51.426 --> 10:54.576
Yes. It seems we'll have to perform
a nutsackectomy.

10:56.251 --> 10:58.253
Will you two quit

10:58.856 --> 11:00.587
with the cockamamie babble

11:00.712 --> 11:03.121
and focus
on what I am trying to tell you?

11:04.060 --> 11:05.660
He said, "cockamamie".

11:08.252 --> 11:09.602
He said, "focus".

11:19.896 --> 11:21.746
What's to become of my son?

11:25.636 --> 11:28.396
Don't worry, Alan.
There'll always be carnivals.

11:30.748 --> 11:31.748
I suppose.

11:32.174 --> 11:35.124
So, how'd it go
with Mr and Mrs Manfred Quinn?

11:35.722 --> 11:37.989
I never met him.
Rose told me to get lost.

11:39.348 --> 11:40.825
That's got to sting a bit.

11:40.994 --> 11:42.246
But I understand.

11:42.371 --> 11:44.746
She's happy now,
and doesn't want me screwing it up.

11:45.681 --> 11:47.332
You still love her, don't you?

11:49.124 --> 11:50.274
I guess I do.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.961
Funny how these things turn out,
isn't it?

11:55.910 --> 11:57.499
Eight, nine years ago,
she was just a

11:57.624 --> 12:00.553
crazy one-night stand
who ended up stalking you.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.569
All you wanted to do
was get rid of her.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.567
But the years go by,

12:07.306 --> 12:09.456
and stalking turns to friendship.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.690
Friendship turns to love.

12:15.297 --> 12:16.476
But it's too late.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.739
She marries another man,
and she's lost to you forever.

12:22.326 --> 12:24.577
Boy, that would make a great movie,
wouldn't it?

12:25.794 --> 12:26.794
Great.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.623
Want to write it with me?

12:31.570 --> 12:33.336
Well, don't go stealing it.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.382
I mean, you know,
it's your life, but it's my idea.

12:39.874 --> 12:41.177
How's this for a title?

12:41.468 --> 12:42.968
<i>Look Who's Stalking.</i>

12:46.487 --> 12:47.887
<i>Meet the Stalkers.</i>

12:51.173 --> 12:52.178
<i>Avatart.</i>

12:54.486 --> 12:55.636
Are you done?

12:57.176 --> 12:59.529
Although I do think
it has real franchise opportunities.

13:00.126 --> 13:01.452
Could be a sitcom.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.322
Maybe not on a major network,
but, you know, TBS, TNT.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.571
<i>I Love Looney.</i>

13:14.516 --> 13:17.088
Where you going?
I was just spitballin' here.

13:22.392 --> 13:23.992
I said, "spitballing".

13:28.012 --> 13:29.662
Oh, God, I want to die.

14:00.051 --> 14:03.551
That has got to be
the worst-looking toupee I've ever seen.

14:04.646 --> 14:06.256
What are you doing here?!

14:07.164 --> 14:08.619
You scared out of me.

14:09.252 --> 14:12.769
Are you crazy, climbing up on my deck,
snooping around like this?!

14:14.615 --> 14:15.855
I need to talk to you.

14:16.321 --> 14:18.983
Well, I can't talk to you.
Manny is right inside.

14:19.153 --> 14:20.902
- I love you.
- It's late for that.

14:21.071 --> 14:23.655
Sorry. I realize now, Rose,
I can't live without you.

14:23.824 --> 14:26.241
It doesn't matter.
I'm married now.

14:26.410 --> 14:27.450
Please, Rose.

14:28.055 --> 14:31.071
God, Charlie, why are you doing
this to me? It's so unfair.

14:31.196 --> 14:32.789
I'm begging you. Talk to me.

14:35.585 --> 14:36.585
All right.

14:37.028 --> 14:39.544
Manny has to go back into the office
to do some work.

14:39.844 --> 14:41.631
- Come back in an hour.
- Thank you.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.264
- Just to talk.
- Of course.

14:43.389 --> 14:45.597
Can you bring me
butter brickle ice cream?

14:46.846 --> 14:49.180
- Marshmallow fluff and sprinkles.
- Whatever you need.

14:49.349 --> 14:51.224
Chocolate sprinkles,
not the multicolored kind.

14:51.393 --> 14:53.518
- Fine.
- I don't know why they even make those.

14:55.492 --> 14:56.563
I'll see you later.

14:58.858 --> 15:00.608
Son of a bitch!
How do you do that?

15:01.112 --> 15:02.712
Don't lock your knees.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.417
Good news, Manny.

15:12.471 --> 15:13.746
We're getting ice cream.

15:20.925 --> 15:23.451
- You ready for some more beans?
- Bring it on.

15:25.872 --> 15:28.587
So, I'm thinking
we call this stunt "Fart Rocket."

15:30.147 --> 15:32.924
Nah, I think we need to go
with something more intellectual.

15:33.636 --> 15:36.205
How about "The Dumbass Assblaster?"

15:37.809 --> 15:40.403
No, you can't use 2 "asses"
in a row. It's...

15:40.887 --> 15:41.937
redumbnant.

15:45.815 --> 15:46.988
What's going on?

15:47.288 --> 15:48.865
Making Eldridge something to eat.

15:49.799 --> 15:50.799
Really?

15:51.969 --> 15:53.572
Yes, I was peckerish.

15:57.031 --> 15:58.582
You mean... peckish.

15:59.546 --> 16:01.015
Fine. If you wanna dicker.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.191
Good one, dude.

16:10.205 --> 16:12.514
- Hey.
- What's in the bag?

16:13.070 --> 16:16.717
Butter brickle ice cream with
marshmallow fluff, chocolate sprinkles.

16:17.383 --> 16:18.383
Charlie, no.

16:19.557 --> 16:21.310
- What?!
- "What?!"

16:22.419 --> 16:25.413
Only one person puts chocolate
sprinkles and marshmallow fluff

16:25.538 --> 16:26.945
on butter brickle ice cream.

16:27.114 --> 16:29.701
Congratulations, Sherlock.
You cracked the case.

16:30.580 --> 16:31.658
She's married.

16:31.921 --> 16:33.660
I can't help it. I love her.

16:33.922 --> 16:37.038
Please. You didn't start loving her
until you couldn't have her.

16:37.207 --> 16:39.997
So?
That doesn't make it... not love.

16:40.794 --> 16:43.299
- What if her husband catches you?
- Then he shoots me,

16:43.424 --> 16:46.437
- and you can have my house and my car.
- Go to her. She's waiting.

16:54.871 --> 16:56.053
Son of a bitch!

17:00.187 --> 17:01.531
Dude, don't waste it.

17:01.816 --> 17:02.896
Squeeze it in!

17:17.320 --> 17:19.226
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

17:21.722 --> 17:24.085
- Is your husband gone?
- He left. We're alone.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.604
- Great.
- Wait.

17:26.256 --> 17:29.643
- We agreed, just talking.
- Right. Just talking. Let's talk.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.896
Do you know what Manny said to me
right before he left?

17:34.067 --> 17:36.476
"I love you, but it's okay
to have an affair with Charlie,

17:36.601 --> 17:38.679
'cause he's a swell guy
and I'm secretly gay"?

17:40.847 --> 17:44.125
He said, in the whole world,
I'm the only one who can move him.

17:46.706 --> 17:47.900
Like I said, gay.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.446
How can I betray a man like that?

17:51.694 --> 17:53.137
I can think of several ways.

17:53.262 --> 17:55.724
You on top, you on bottom,
everybody facing the TV.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.245
Who moves you, Rose?
Him or me?

18:00.740 --> 18:03.583
I don't know. I'm confused.
I love Manny.

18:03.752 --> 18:06.127
But we're soul mates,
like Romeo and Juliet.

18:06.535 --> 18:09.745
Really? Did Romeo ever chew through
the ropes holding him to a radiator

18:09.870 --> 18:11.326
in a motel of Bakersfield

18:11.451 --> 18:14.104
when Juliet was trying
to give him a birthday surprise?

18:14.995 --> 18:17.097
Birthday surprise?
You were going to brand me.

18:17.345 --> 18:19.469
Branding is the new piercing,
Charlie.

18:20.688 --> 18:23.478
Fine. Pierce me, brand me,
do anything you want.

18:23.716 --> 18:25.480
- Anything?
- It's an expression.

18:27.986 --> 18:31.736
- Give me another chance, Rose.
- No... It's wrong.

18:32.163 --> 18:34.656
Fine.
You just say the word, and I'll go.

18:37.255 --> 18:38.255
Time's up.

18:41.077 --> 18:42.931
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

18:44.865 --> 18:47.085
- You know what this means?
- I think so.

18:48.004 --> 18:49.698
You're gonna have to kill Manny.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.390
- What?!
- Kidding.

18:53.658 --> 18:55.357
Just wanted to see how far you'd go.

19:01.267 --> 19:03.554
- Can I tell you something, Rose?
- Anything.

19:04.536 --> 19:08.106
I've never felt happier and more
at peace than I do at this very moment.

19:08.885 --> 19:10.659
Who's being a little gay now?

19:25.221 --> 19:26.688
It's a text from Manny.

19:26.813 --> 19:28.543
He's on his way home.
You have to go.

19:30.551 --> 19:33.339
- When can I see you again?
- You can't. This was a mistake.

19:33.508 --> 19:35.406
- How can you say that?
- Charlie,

19:35.531 --> 19:38.511
- I love my husband.
- Forget Manny. Run away with me.

19:38.956 --> 19:40.638
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

19:40.959 --> 19:41.959
Come on.

19:42.059 --> 19:44.601
If you had me to yourself,
you'd be tired of me within a year.

19:44.770 --> 19:46.815
Then you can go back to Manny.
Everybody wins.

19:49.524 --> 19:50.524
Go.

19:53.505 --> 19:54.555
I love you.

20:01.663 --> 20:04.156
Aren't you the naughty boy
who likes to watch?

20:11.045 --> 20:13.806
- Hurry up, dude. I'm about to blow.
- Hang on.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.121
<i>Hi. I'm Jake Harper,</i>

20:18.385 --> 20:21.033
<i>and you're about to witness
a little something we like to call...</i>

20:22.830 --> 20:24.262
<i>"Fumes of Fury."</i>

20:25.340 --> 20:27.257
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.

20:27.483 --> 20:29.578
Remember,
if you don't reach the ocean,

20:29.703 --> 20:31.689
- just tuck and roll.
- Okay, hurry up.

20:32.266 --> 20:34.120
All right. Let 'er rip.

20:42.315 --> 20:43.315
Dumbasses.

20:46.573 --> 20:49.317
- I can't believe nothing happened.
- I wouldn't say that.

20:49.442 --> 20:51.177
I think I crapped my pants.

20:52.305 --> 20:58.173
