<i>Hello, you collection of shit sippers.</i>

00:06.623 --> 00:09.456
<i>It's week one. Ruxin versus Pete.</i>

00:09.626 --> 00:11.787
- He's a little gnome.
- Miserable troll.

00:11.961 --> 00:14.191
<i>Question:</i>
<i>Is Three Beat the name of your team...</i>

00:14.364 --> 00:16.491
<i>...or the amount of times</i>
<i>you plan on getting married?</i>

00:16.666 --> 00:18.531
<i>- Oh, touchy subject.</i>
KEVIN: Heh-heh-heh.

00:18.702 --> 00:20.966
<i>Do you think single life</i>
<i>is gonna be easier?</i>

00:21.137 --> 00:23.731
<i>No, no, no, my friend,</i>
<i>it's gonna take effort.</i>

00:23.907 --> 00:26.137
<i>Remember how in college,</i>
<i>you used to get drunk...</i>

00:26.309 --> 00:28.368
<i>...and a girl would, like,</i>
<i>fall on your dick?</i>

00:28.545 --> 00:32.003
<i>- That's not the way it works in your 30s.</i>
- He's got a point there, okay?

00:32.182 --> 00:34.707
There are things you don't know.
Been out of the game a while.

00:34.884 --> 00:36.943
<i>Can you imagine</i>
<i>you going to a bar right now?</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:39.884
<i>Well, if you can't,</i>
<i>I brought some visual aids to help out.</i>

00:40.056 --> 00:41.921
[IN DEEP VOICE]
<i>"Oh, hey, it's me, Pete."</i>

00:42.092 --> 00:44.356

<i>"Oh, hey, I'm a 21-year-old."</i>

00:44.527 --> 00:48.429
[IN DEEP VOICE] <i>"Oh, you wanna go to</i>
<i>a Counting Crows concert this weekend?"</i>

00:48.598 --> 00:50.327
[IN HIGH VOICE]
<i>"Who are the Counting Crows?"</i>

00:50.500 --> 00:53.697
[IN DEEP VOICE] <i>"Are you kidding me,</i>

- No.

01:03.379 --> 01:08.146
<i>"Oh, thank God Kevin's penis is so small.</i>
<i>I can fit it in my mouth and still talk."</i>

ANDRE:
So it's, like, "over" over? I mean, is it...?

01:16.025 --> 01:17.049
PETE:
Pretty much. Yeah.

01:17.227 --> 01:19.218
I got an apartment. It's over.

01:19.395 --> 01:21.761
There's like a ripple effect
for your breakup.

01:22.265 --> 01:23.926
It goes beyond you.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.168
- Oh, in terms of how it affects, like, you?
- Yes, exactly.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.000
- I didn't think about that.
RUXIN: You did not think about that.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.837
I wasn't sensitive to your feelings as I was
going through a split-up with my wife.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.411
Yeah, your breakup
is affecting me now...

01:37.580 --> 01:40.481
...because I have not had sex
with Sofia since she had the baby.

01:40.650 --> 01:42.880
She was about ready
to start opening it up...

01:43.052 --> 01:45.452
...and now
she is so distraught because of it...

01:45.622 --> 01:47.249
...she's spending her time with Meegan.

01:47.724 --> 01:51.888
Are you basically saying
I should get back together with Meegan...

01:52.061 --> 01:54.552
...because it's mildly inconvenient
for your sex life?

01:54.731 --> 01:57.700
I would like you to have a kid
so we're living under the same restrictions.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.698
PETE: Oh, you got it, man.
RUXIN: Yeah, thank you.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.632
Yours.

02:01.805 --> 02:02.897
I ordered a Riesling.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.637
You ordered that.
I don't... I'm not ordering that.

02:05.809 --> 02:07.538
This is... We're in public.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.301
Child, please.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.938
- What?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, what was that?

02:12.115 --> 02:13.104
Child, please.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.083
- Is that Ochocinco?
RUXIN: Ochocinco.

02:16.251 --> 02:19.982
Can we get back on track and explain
to you that my balls are like New Orleans...

02:20.155 --> 02:22.487
...and the levees are about to burst.

02:22.658 --> 02:25.991
Why don't you just jerk off?
I don't understand what the problem is.

02:26.161 --> 02:27.992
- Masturbate.
- No, I'm not... I don't.

02:28.163 --> 02:31.530
My sexual imagination is not sexy,
it's scary.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.668
You just need porn.
Get yourself some porn.

02:33.835 --> 02:37.100
- I would love some porn.
- Just get a magazine or something soft-core.

02:37.272 --> 02:40.537
I don't like the way porno magazines
smell, okay? Ugh.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.973
I can't have porno in the house...

02:43.145 --> 02:46.273
...because Sofia considers that cheating.
Any visual aid is cheating?

02:46.448 --> 02:48.040
Any visual aid is cheating.

02:48.216 --> 02:49.843
I got a deal with Jenny.

02:50.018 --> 02:52.646
I can watch as much porn as I want
as long as I'm working out.

02:52.821 --> 02:54.118
- Even hard-core stuff?
- Yep.

02:54.289 --> 02:58.555
All I know is that if I don't come soon,
that I'm gonna physically get sick.

02:58.727 --> 03:01.821
- You can get sick.
- No, you can't get sick.

03:01.997 --> 03:03.521
As a doctor, trust me, I know.

03:03.699 --> 03:05.360
Andre, you're a plastic surgeon.

03:05.534 --> 03:06.558
- Okay?
- Yeah.

03:06.735 --> 03:08.635
So the next time I wanna take butt fat...

03:08.804 --> 03:10.897
...and inject it into my penis,
I will come to you.

03:11.073 --> 03:12.370
[ALL LAUGHING]

03:12.541 --> 03:15.408
Okay, yeah, I don't do that anymore.

03:15.577 --> 03:17.067
- It's dangerous.
PETE: It isn't.

03:17.245 --> 03:19.611
We gotta get going, come on.
We gotta do a thing.

03:19.781 --> 03:22.249
- Where you guys going?
- Couples' dinner.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.851
PETE: Kevin, let me talk to you for a second.
- Let's go.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.715
We're gonna be late, dude.

03:26.989 --> 03:30.516
I know it's gonna be natural for me
to be the topic of conversation tonight.

03:30.692 --> 03:34.128
- Could you just put a damper on that?
- It won't even come up, I promise.

03:34.296 --> 03:36.594
It's over, kaput, <i>finito</i>. Done.

03:36.765 --> 03:38.562
He's got his own place now.

03:38.734 --> 03:41.965
I mean, she gave him all the good years.
Pete hasn't even grown up.

03:42.137 --> 03:43.729
It's not right. He's not thinking.

03:43.905 --> 03:47.136
He's totally immature.
I mean, you don't just leave your wife.

03:47.309 --> 03:50.176
Everybody fights.
We fight like cats and dogs but...

03:50.345 --> 03:52.438
RUXIN: You know what?
SOFIA: We're not getting a divorce.

03:52.614 --> 03:54.673
No, because this dog loves that cat.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.284
- You know? Woof, woof.
JENNY: That's cute.

03:57.452 --> 03:58.817
- I love you.
- I love you too.

03:58.987 --> 04:00.045
I love you.

04:00.222 --> 04:02.452
Maybe tonight we could show each other
how we love each other.

04:02.624 --> 04:04.819
Mm-mm. We're not having
this conversation.

04:04.993 --> 04:06.824
- I can't talk to her.
- What do you mean?

04:06.995 --> 04:09.088
I can't talk to her.
We have nothing in common.

04:09.264 --> 04:10.253
Ask her a question.

04:10.432 --> 04:12.832
Ask her about her dress
or where she gets the shoes.

04:13.001 --> 04:15.765
- I'm uncomfortable.
- I know you are but you have to do this.

04:15.937 --> 04:17.096
How's the baby?

04:17.272 --> 04:18.534
- He is amazing.
JENNY: Yeah?

04:18.707 --> 04:19.731
Beautiful.

04:19.908 --> 04:22.137
- He's a gift.
- And he gave me a gift.

04:23.145 --> 04:24.806
- The gift of boobs.
JENNY: Wow.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.306
- Look at those.
SOFIA: Yeah.

04:26.481 --> 04:28.472
- They're gorgeous.
- Those are something.

04:28.950 --> 04:32.113
SOFIA: I've never had boobs this big, ever.
JENNY: They're wonderful.

04:32.287 --> 04:33.379
- Here, feel it.
- That's okay.

04:33.555 --> 04:35.955
Come on, feel it. Come on, feel it.

04:36.124 --> 04:38.524
- Oh, yep, they're big.
- Isn't it fantastic?

04:38.693 --> 04:41.890
Okay, your wife has more access
to my wife's breasts than I do.

04:42.064 --> 04:45.090
How are yours?
Did they stay that way, let me see?

04:45.267 --> 04:48.464
I would be a little concerned
of stretch marks when they're that big.

04:48.637 --> 04:49.934
Okay, all right.

04:50.105 --> 04:52.699
Pete is killing me
and his breakup is killing me.

04:52.874 --> 04:54.774
- Okay.

It's so upsetting.

04:56.211 --> 05:00.045
The thing is that I wanna let you know
is that I'll never leave you.

05:00.615 --> 05:02.981
Well, I don't think Kevin
would ever leave me.

05:03.151 --> 05:05.984
- Why's that?
- Because I have confidence in my pussy.

05:06.154 --> 05:07.348
RUXIN: Ha-ha-ha!
- Um...

05:07.522 --> 05:09.649
- Sweetheart, that's...
SOFIA: That's good, I mean...

05:09.825 --> 05:11.224
- I got a great puss.
- Stop it.

05:11.393 --> 05:13.224
RUXIN: You do.
- You're dropping P bombs.

05:13.395 --> 05:19.334
Can I ask? Do you have great confidence
in your pussy, or is this vaginal hubris?

05:19.501 --> 05:20.900
- Do you want references?
- Yeah.

05:21.069 --> 05:22.559
If he doesn't wanna talk about it...

05:22.737 --> 05:25.797
...I'm pretty sure my ex-boyfriend
would tell you all about it.

05:25.974 --> 05:28.909
- Are you out of your mind?
- What is your ex's full name?

05:29.077 --> 05:31.341
You don't need to know about it.
I am proud of it.

05:31.513 --> 05:34.038
It's a lovely pussy.
You should be proud of your pussy.

05:34.216 --> 05:35.581
Oh, my God.

- How's your pussy? She have a good pussy?
KEVIN: Stop it. I'm sorry.

05:45.393 --> 05:48.362
Eight years,
things have changed, bigtime.

05:48.530 --> 05:52.694
First of all, you can't just go up
and talk to a girl anymore, all right?

05:52.868 --> 05:54.733
That's out. You gotta neg them.

05:54.903 --> 05:57.736
- Neg, as in be negative?
- Exactly.

05:57.906 --> 05:59.498
Wait. Watch.

06:00.642 --> 06:03.509
Nice pants. Makes your butt look fat.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.849
- Okay, yeah, she hates you right now.
- Right now.

06:08.016 --> 06:10.883
Come midnight, she'll be back. Watch.

06:11.052 --> 06:14.146
I don't think negging is for me,
I gotta say. It's not my speed.

06:14.322 --> 06:16.256
If you're not gonna do negging,
do magic.

06:16.424 --> 06:20.224
So you're gonna look me in the eye
and tell me that girls at a bar like magic?

06:20.762 --> 06:24.858
I'm gonna tell you
that everybody loves magic.

06:26.001 --> 06:28.834
- Everyone.
- What's your success rate around here?

06:29.004 --> 06:30.938
What are we talking? Hand jibbers?

06:31.106 --> 06:33.006
Anything. Anything at all.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.233
- What's up, boys?
- Taco.

06:34.409 --> 06:37.572
- Dr. Dre, Pete, what's going on?
- Not much, what's going on?

06:37.746 --> 06:40.237
- Hey, let me buy you a drink, on me.
- No, man. I don't...

06:40.415 --> 06:43.213
I don't pay for drinks here.
The bartender's my Eskimo brother.

06:43.385 --> 06:45.376
What's up, T-Bag? Can I get the usual?

06:45.554 --> 06:47.886
What's a Eskimo brother?

06:48.056 --> 06:49.353
Eskimo brother.

06:50.392 --> 06:54.954
When two guys had sex with the same girl,
they're Eskimo brothers.

06:55.130 --> 06:58.122
Wait, so you guys
had sex with the same girl?

06:58.300 --> 07:00.860
- Yeah. Linda.
- How do you know that?

07:01.036 --> 07:02.936
You just do. Guys...

07:03.104 --> 07:05.504
You have to know
what your Eskimo family tree is.

07:05.674 --> 07:09.235
- That's how you get things done.
- It's like your Platinum card?

07:09.411 --> 07:10.742
How do you get things done?

07:10.912 --> 07:12.311
- We got jobs.
- Went to college.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.005
Yeah, and we make money
and we purchase things.

07:15.183 --> 07:16.775
You guys are weird.

07:16.952 --> 07:20.046
I'll pay 5 bucks for valet,
but 6.50 is ridiculous.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.554
- What?
- It's too much money for the valet.

07:22.724 --> 07:24.783
- What do you tip?
- I don't know.

07:24.960 --> 07:25.949
Oh, my God, you're wasted.

07:27.712 --> 07:28.701
I don't know.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.869
- Oh, look at you.
- Take them off.

07:30.048 --> 07:31.538
Okay, relax. I'll take them off.

07:31.816 --> 07:33.750
Skinny jeans. Why?

07:34.385 --> 07:36.444
- Let's go to bed, I'm exhausted.
- Come on.

07:36.621 --> 07:37.713
Yes. Mmm.

07:37.889 --> 07:39.447
No, no, no.

07:39.624 --> 07:40.989
Why? No?

07:41.159 --> 07:44.060
- You're killing my confidence here.
- It's not about confidence.

07:44.229 --> 07:46.823
You'll pass out.
It turns into an after-school special.

07:46.998 --> 07:49.694
- I feel weird about this, I do.
- I'm not gonna pass out.

07:49.868 --> 07:53.031
- I'm gonna get you.
- No, no, no, you're not gonna get me.

07:53.204 --> 07:56.105
KEVIN:
Oh, my God, you're aggressive.

07:56.274 --> 07:59.641
- This is very, very unlike you.
- I'm gonna show you why I'm so confident.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.041
KEVIN:
Just relax. You're gonna pull something.

08:02.213 --> 08:04.044
Wait a second, where's your leg?

08:04.215 --> 08:05.341
- Oh, my God.
JENNY: Right?

08:05.650 --> 08:08.881
- Ha-ha-ha!
KEVIN: Oh, my God. That, keep doing that.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.145
Keep doing that.

08:13.591 --> 08:17.118
Knock, knock, knock.
Oh, well, this place is a shit hole.

08:18.563 --> 08:21.088
- Thank you.
- Bachelor care package.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.324
What is this?

08:23.501 --> 08:25.401
DVD on how to save
your marriage after an affair.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.333
Thank you. I didn't have an affair.

08:27.505 --> 08:30.668
I just found it at the gas station,
in the bargain bin.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.275
- Hey, you back together with Meegan yet?
- I did not.

08:33.443 --> 08:36.311
- Are you having sex with your wife yet?
- No, no, I'm not.

08:36.481 --> 08:38.539
- Is there a bottle opener around here?
- Nope.

08:39.616 --> 08:40.914
Great.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.953
Look, I know you're just doing this to get,
like, a little vacation for your marriage.

08:45.123 --> 08:48.320
But can't you just scurry back
for like one week?

08:48.493 --> 08:51.758
Being married to Meegan
is like being at the beach, okay?

08:51.930 --> 08:55.730
You put up with this shit that's completely
unacceptable in any other situation.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.061
Except that, "Hey, we're at the beach."

08:58.236 --> 09:02.036
