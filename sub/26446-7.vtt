WEBVTT

00:11.408 --> 00:14.410
Okay. You want to live with me,
you eat when I eat.

00:14.411 --> 00:16.512
Man, afterwards, we can get
some leftovers, go home

00:16.513 --> 00:19.582
and watch this documentary
on the '70s gas crisis.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.350
Wait. Didn't we just watch that?

00:21.351 --> 00:23.753
No, no, no, man,
that was a documentary

00:23.754 --> 00:26.255
on the '70s calculator craze.
That was a game changer.

00:26.256 --> 00:28.557
Americans didn't have
to use their brains anymore.

00:28.558 --> 00:32.228
Well, actually, I got a date tonight.

00:32.875 --> 00:35.185
Oh. Well, go ahead, invite her by.

00:35.186 --> 00:36.968
Matter of fact,
why don't you call up Rel?

00:36.969 --> 00:38.160
Everybody can come by.

00:38.161 --> 00:40.863
We do not get together enough
as a family, man.

00:40.864 --> 00:43.132
Dad, we just watched
the Bulls game two nights ago.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.767
You're gonna miss these
moments when I'm gone.

00:44.768 --> 00:46.669
I'll be out the house,
walking around naked,

00:46.670 --> 00:49.138
don't even know my own name,
can't find my way back home.

00:49.139 --> 00:51.807
Hey, here comes the chef. Cool.

00:55.045 --> 00:57.212
Konnichiwa.

01:05.622 --> 01:07.957
All right, we're gonna start
with the vegetables, okay?

01:07.958 --> 01:09.892
Look at these vegetables...
Oh, look at that.

01:09.893 --> 01:11.594
Oh, look at that.

01:11.595 --> 01:13.835
Choo-choo! Chooga-chugga,
chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga...

01:15.031 --> 01:17.500
Oh, and I'm about... and I'm
gonna throw it over there.

01:17.501 --> 01:19.501
You ready? Here we go.

01:24.307 --> 01:27.176
Uh...

01:27.177 --> 01:30.379
Give me... give me,
give me one second.

01:32.682 --> 01:34.483
Damn it, Harold!

01:34.484 --> 01:37.453
What is wrong with you?!
Okay, it's just a shrimp tail!

01:37.454 --> 01:40.322
It should be thrown in the bowl!
Why did you use your left hand?

01:40.323 --> 01:42.157
You're right-handed! Also,

01:42.158 --> 01:44.326
you're not supposed
to use the Japanese accent.

01:44.327 --> 01:46.595
They've told you a hundred times
that it's racist,

01:46.596 --> 01:49.164
and it makes everybody at work
feel uncomfortable.

01:49.165 --> 01:51.433
You don't want them
to start talking jive, do you?

01:51.434 --> 01:53.469
Do you?!

01:56.940 --> 01:59.608
Ah, there. You know what I mean?

01:59.609 --> 02:01.544
All right, what are we gonna do?

02:01.545 --> 02:03.012
We're gonna get these eggs
going, right?

02:03.013 --> 02:05.881
Oh. Egg time.

02:05.882 --> 02:08.383
Egg time. Ooh!

02:08.384 --> 02:10.386
Aah!

02:16.760 --> 02:19.228
One second, I'll be right back.

02:20.797 --> 02:23.132
You idiot!

02:23.133 --> 02:25.134
You don't know
how to break a freaking egg?!

02:25.135 --> 02:27.236
Now you got yolk on your hand!

02:27.237 --> 02:28.904
Damn it! Stop it, Harold!

02:33.810 --> 02:35.477
Uh, hi.

02:35.478 --> 02:37.947
You know, this...

02:37.948 --> 02:40.282
Look, guys, I'll-I'll level with you.

02:40.283 --> 02:42.451
I don't have a Japanese accent.

02:42.452 --> 02:45.020
- I don't know if you knew that.
- Yeah.

02:45.021 --> 02:48.090
I'm an ordinary African-American
man named Harold.

02:48.091 --> 02:51.226
Guys, look, this is my first day.

02:51.227 --> 02:53.429
I just really wanted
to impress you guys.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.431
I've been training all week, and,

02:55.432 --> 02:58.634
you know, my family's usually
disappointed!

02:58.635 --> 03:00.736
Why did you put your hands
on the grill, you idiot?!

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.680 --> 03:12.848
All right, Terry, Erica,
look, I love helping you

03:12.849 --> 03:14.650
with your homework on
FaceTime and everything,

03:14.651 --> 03:17.686
but this new math is a little
confusing, so do me a favor.

03:17.687 --> 03:21.190
Everything I told you,
ask your mama if it's right.

03:21.191 --> 03:23.459
A'ight? Okay, I love y'all.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.295
Aw. Bye.

03:26.296 --> 03:29.131
Ooh. All right, let's see here.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.434
Today...

03:33.798 --> 03:38.669
It says here you got
hypoglycemia, hypertension.

03:38.670 --> 03:40.155
Wow. You're what we call

03:40.156 --> 03:42.458
in the medical community a "hype man."

03:42.459 --> 03:45.828
Oh, great, another Patch
Adams up in this bitch.

03:45.829 --> 03:49.765
You know, with that attitude,
you're not gonna get a lollipop.

03:52.135 --> 03:53.936
I'm kidding.

03:53.937 --> 03:55.671
I got you right here, brother.
There we go.

03:57.407 --> 03:59.341
Okay, you ain't gonna have it.
It's all good.

03:59.342 --> 04:01.277
Well, Mr. Nickels...

04:01.278 --> 04:04.580
Wait. Grady Nickels.

04:04.581 --> 04:06.315
Were you in a band called The Dragons?

04:06.316 --> 04:09.018
Oh. You a fan, huh?

04:09.019 --> 04:10.653
Uh, I mean, sort of.

04:10.654 --> 04:13.422
Look, my dad was in The Dragons.
He played the bass.

04:13.423 --> 04:16.125
Milton's son became a doctor.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.127
Not exactly.

04:18.128 --> 04:20.161
I mean, I'm a nurse.

04:20.163 --> 04:22.731
Oh. That sounds more like it.

04:22.732 --> 04:25.968
I don't know what that means,
but you know something?

04:25.969 --> 04:27.703
I think Dad'll be really excited
to know that you're here,

04:27.704 --> 04:29.772
you know what I mean?
So, I'm gonna give him a call.

04:29.773 --> 04:31.440
This is what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna be like,

04:31.441 --> 04:32.841
"Hey, Dad. Who's in this hospital?

04:32.842 --> 04:34.510
You ain't gonna believe it."

04:34.511 --> 04:36.645
And then you're gonna just
start singing.

04:36.646 --> 04:38.314
Oh, this is gonna be beautiful.

04:38.315 --> 04:41.116
One of us gonna cry.
It's probably gonna be me.

04:41.117 --> 04:42.918
I never want to talk
to that bastard again.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.588
I mean, you could've just said that.

04:46.589 --> 04:48.624
You didn't have
to knock my phone down.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.361
I didn't realize

04:52.362 --> 04:53.996
Dad was hated so much by somebody

04:53.997 --> 04:56.332
that they would break my phone
to get back at him.

04:56.333 --> 05:00.869
And damn it,
I forgot to get their insurance.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.571
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:02.572 --> 05:05.232
Wasn't Nickels the front man
in the band's publicity photos?

05:05.233 --> 05:06.895
He was the one going like this, right?

05:06.896 --> 05:09.330
No, no, no.
See, you got that all wrong.

05:09.331 --> 05:11.833
That-that was Mitchell, okay?
Nickels was the one like this.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.135
You know, he did the...
the sleepy, sexy pose.

05:14.136 --> 05:15.704
Oh. Mm-hmm.

05:15.705 --> 05:17.839
So, what pose did y'all dad do?

05:17.840 --> 05:19.541
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh, no, see, he would...

05:19.542 --> 05:20.942
He was cool about it, right?

05:20.943 --> 05:22.877
He was on a lamp...
lamppost like this.

05:22.878 --> 05:24.279
He had his... his legs crossed,

05:24.280 --> 05:27.515
he had his bass in his hand,
he did this.

05:27.516 --> 05:30.385
So what do you think happened
between Dad and Nickels, anyway?

05:30.386 --> 05:36.191
I'm guessing somebody stole
somebody's woman or their TV.

05:36.192 --> 05:39.127
'Cause those are the only
two things guys care about.

05:39.128 --> 05:41.462
Bitches and flat-screens.

05:42.865 --> 05:44.599
Prove me wrong.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.768
Do you always listen
to people's conversations?

05:46.769 --> 05:50.105
Yes, all the time,
unless they're boring.

05:50.106 --> 05:52.307
But y'all problems are so good,
though.

05:52.308 --> 05:55.443
Look, I don't really get it,
myself, too,

05:55.444 --> 05:57.979
'cause I-I thought
they were all still cool.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.481
Maybe just lost touch with each other.

05:59.482 --> 06:01.249
You know, you know, life happens.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.785
Look, it seems like Dad has lost
touch with all of his friends.

06:03.786 --> 06:05.420
I mean, I love him,

06:05.421 --> 06:07.655
but I'm running out
of documentaries to watch.

06:07.656 --> 06:09.524
I feel like
I'm wasting my 20s being 60.

06:09.525 --> 06:11.092
Hey, you know something?

06:11.093 --> 06:13.762
Dad always texting me at work,
"What's up?"

06:13.763 --> 06:15.897
And then, if, like...
if he calls me, I don't answer,

06:15.898 --> 06:18.032
then he FaceTime me.
The one thing I hate

06:18.033 --> 06:20.168
about FaceTiming Dad...
he's real close to the phone.

06:20.169 --> 06:21.603
Why do old people be so close
to the phone

06:21.604 --> 06:23.905
- when they're FaceTiming?
- Oh.

06:23.906 --> 06:26.341
And plus, Dad is so needy.
You know what I'm saying?

06:26.342 --> 06:28.376
Man, for the first time, Britt,
I'm actually jealous

06:28.377 --> 06:30.812
that your dad abandoned you.

06:30.813 --> 06:32.680
Thanks, Nat. I'll try to remember that

06:32.681 --> 06:34.349
the next time
I'm at a movie with a guy,

06:34.350 --> 06:35.750
and he goes to get the popcorn,

06:35.751 --> 06:37.352
and I assume he ain't coming back.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.120
You know what you should do?

06:39.121 --> 06:41.656
Go to one of those theaters
where you order the popcorn

06:41.657 --> 06:44.692
from your seat,
and they bring it to you.

06:44.693 --> 06:47.362
That'll keep his ass in that seat.

06:49.265 --> 06:52.667
That actually ain't a bad idea.

06:52.668 --> 06:55.270
- So really, what should we do?
- Look,

06:55.271 --> 06:57.172
we know how Nickels feel about Dad,

06:57.173 --> 06:59.607
but we don't know
how Dad feel about Nickels.

06:59.608 --> 07:01.376
Look, I don't know.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.511
Maybe we should do what he
did to us when we fought.

07:03.512 --> 07:06.915
Take off his belt
and light our asses up?

07:06.916 --> 07:08.650
No, no, no, the other thing.

07:08.651 --> 07:10.652
Okay, when, you know,
he would lock us up in a room

07:10.653 --> 07:12.253
and make us talk until we made up.

07:12.254 --> 07:14.088
Maybe we get both of them
in the same room,

07:14.089 --> 07:17.859
and all those old memories start
coming up, they'll stop beefing.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.062
Only thing about that is,
we just got to figure out a way

07:21.063 --> 07:23.231
to get Dad to see Nickels
in the hospital.

07:23.232 --> 07:24.833
Leave that to me.

07:24.834 --> 07:27.101
Oh, I know this is gonna be good.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.876
Man, I can't believe
Scottie Pippen is getting

07:34.877 --> 07:36.411
his appendix taken out.

07:36.412 --> 07:38.546
- Thanks, Nat.
- I knew you'd want to come here.

07:38.547 --> 07:40.415
You're the biggest
Scottie Pippen fan I know.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.749
I know, man.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.018
Uh, get that off of you.

07:44.019 --> 07:45.787
I got a surprise for you.

07:45.788 --> 07:48.723
- I'm all better?
- No.

07:48.724 --> 07:52.060
But, I got
a non-medical surprise for you.

07:52.061 --> 07:53.661
You got a visitor.

07:53.662 --> 07:54.996
My estranged wife?

07:54.997 --> 07:56.898
No.

07:56.899 --> 07:59.033
My estranged daughter?

07:59.034 --> 08:00.635
No, but damn, man,

08:00.636 --> 08:03.538
how many estranged people
you got in your life?

08:03.539 --> 08:05.240
Scottie Pippen, it's such an hon...,

08:05.241 --> 08:07.575
Nickels?

08:07.576 --> 08:09.143
You ain't Scottie Pippen.

08:10.512 --> 08:11.846
What's going on, Rel?

08:11.847 --> 08:13.915
Hear me out. Nickels.

08:13.916 --> 08:16.251
This is... your homeboy.
And it's you here.

08:16.252 --> 08:18.419
You know, I figured, you know,
I don't know what happened,

08:18.420 --> 08:19.988
'cause I wasn't really born when...

08:19.989 --> 08:21.689
you know, with you guys,
years ago. And I was like,

08:21.690 --> 08:23.358
"Okay, maybe I should do a good thing,

08:23.359 --> 08:24.926
"'cause they used
to be bandmates and friends.

08:24.927 --> 08:26.794
"How about I get them together, right,

08:26.795 --> 08:28.963
and have them talk
and figure some things out?"

08:28.964 --> 08:31.766
So, what me and Nat gonna do...
we gonna leave

08:31.767 --> 08:33.668
and let y'all do your thing, a'ight?

08:33.669 --> 08:35.532
- Son of a bitch!
- Dirty bastard!

08:35.533 --> 08:37.705
Hey! Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

08:37.706 --> 08:40.475
- Wait! Hey!
- What?

08:40.476 --> 08:42.977
Oh, wait! Hey! Hey!

08:42.977 --> 08:45.046
You bring a man here I hate
in a room I can't leave?!

08:45.047 --> 08:47.115
Man, I don't care about... Pull
the plug, Rel! Pull the plug!

08:47.116 --> 08:49.284
- What. Wait. What? What plug?
- Pull the plug, Rel!

08:49.285 --> 08:50.685
Wait. Dad, it's a phone charger.

08:50.686 --> 08:52.053
I don't care! Pull it!

08:52.054 --> 08:54.155
He can't call nobody.

08:54.156 --> 08:55.723
Give me my ball back!

09:01.271 --> 09:03.105
Man, that fight was crazy.

09:03.446 --> 09:05.934
Look, I know Dad was trying
to hurt Nickels,

09:05.935 --> 09:07.286
but when I talked to the doctor,
he said

09:07.287 --> 09:09.522
that the physical stimulation
actually improved

09:09.523 --> 09:13.092
his overall heart function.

09:13.093 --> 09:14.627
Nah, man, you don't fight like that

09:14.628 --> 09:16.763
if all you did was lose touch
with somebody.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.198
There's something
Dad's not telling us.

09:19.199 --> 09:22.902
He ain't tell us Nickels was
this fine.

09:22.903 --> 09:25.104
Okay, slow down, slow down,
Britt, okay?

09:25.105 --> 09:26.706
That was 30 years ago.

09:26.707 --> 09:28.341
Look, I looked at his X-rays, okay?

09:28.342 --> 09:29.709
He look like Donald Glover
on the outside,

09:29.710 --> 09:31.611
but inside, he's Danny Glover.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.946
Look, Rel, I love an old hot guy.

09:33.947 --> 09:36.115
He's still got the confidence
of a young hot guy,

09:36.116 --> 09:37.850
just without the options.

09:37.851 --> 09:40.153
You know what a man like that
gets as he grows older?

09:40.154 --> 09:42.321
Sick.

09:42.322 --> 09:44.123
The man is in a hospital bed.

09:44.124 --> 09:46.592
No. Perspective.

09:46.593 --> 09:49.062
Look, they realize
they can't treat women

09:49.063 --> 09:51.631
like they used to, right?
So they up their game.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.300
If I want a man that's gonna
make me the center of his life,

09:54.301 --> 09:56.769
I'm-a choose a man that ain't
got that much life left.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.771
Hmm.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.707
I mean, you make a good point,
but damn.

10:09.283 --> 10:11.918
You owe me Scottie Pippen's autograph.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.255
And don't come home till you get it.

10:16.256 --> 10:17.657
Hi, Dad. Quick question.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.325
What was that fight with Nickels
all about?

10:19.326 --> 10:22.428
All right, you want the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.

10:22.429 --> 10:25.198
Back in the day, Nickels tried
to hook up with your mom.

10:25.199 --> 10:26.799
It was before one of our big shows.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.668
I saw him talking to her
with my own eyes.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.536
Then when I confronted him
about it, you know,

10:30.537 --> 10:32.772
he got mad and kicked me out the band.

10:32.773 --> 10:35.942
Pretty bastard think
everything belong to him.

10:35.943 --> 10:39.846
Wait, but-but Mom wouldn't
hook up with Nickels, right?

10:39.847 --> 10:42.315
No, no. We had a loyal
and loving relationship.

10:42.316 --> 10:44.584
It's about Nickels crossing
that unforgivable line.

10:44.585 --> 10:45.785
You know what I'm talking about.

10:45.786 --> 10:47.019
All right, it makes sense.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.821
I get why you would be upset,

10:48.822 --> 10:52.725
but, you know, that flirtation
happened, like, decades ago.

10:52.726 --> 10:55.090
You still would hold on
to a grudge like that?

10:55.091 --> 10:56.092
Yes.

10:56.093 --> 10:59.866
A good grudge
will keep you young and vital.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.235
Listen, Dad, living with you,

11:02.236 --> 11:04.971
I've noticed that you don't have
that many friends or...

11:04.972 --> 11:06.639
a friend at all.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.508
Uh, wouldn't it be nice

11:08.509 --> 11:09.976
- if you just had somebody...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:09.977 --> 11:11.844
I know you not calling me lonely.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.479
Mr. Go on a Fake Date.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.314
Ain't no girl come by the house yet.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.887
I choose to be by myself,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.655
just like I choose

11:22.656 --> 11:24.524
to go down to the bar
and read a newspaper.

11:24.525 --> 11:26.993
By myself. By choice.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.966
I can't believe all this happened

11:33.967 --> 11:36.903
because Nickels flirted with Mom.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.905
It's not. Look...

11:38.906 --> 11:41.407
Nickels flirts with your mother,

11:41.408 --> 11:43.342
and your dad is the one
to get kicked out?

11:43.343 --> 11:48.047
Story don't add up. Your father lying.

11:48.048 --> 11:49.816
So if y'all want them
to be friends again,

11:49.817 --> 11:51.917
you're gonna have to find
out what really happened.

11:53.787 --> 11:56.155
Brittany's got a point.

11:56.156 --> 11:58.157
All right, Nat.

11:58.158 --> 12:00.893
We got to go down here
and holler at Nickels.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.495
W-Wait, I should come, too.

12:02.496 --> 12:06.332
I could probably raise his... spirits.

12:11.705 --> 12:14.707
- Hey, Mr. Nickels.
- Hey.

12:14.708 --> 12:17.443
How you doing, man?
Uh, how you feeling?

12:17.444 --> 12:19.712
- Good, except I got this pain in my...
- Oh, oh, okay.

12:19.713 --> 12:22.381
I didn't really mean it.
I'm off the clock.

12:22.382 --> 12:24.183
But I did have a question for you.

12:24.184 --> 12:26.219
Why did you kick my dad
out of The Dragons?

12:26.220 --> 12:28.120
Okay, before we get
into all of that, though,

12:28.121 --> 12:30.356
I just want to say I'm Brittany.

12:32.392 --> 12:34.393
And I'm Grady Nickels.

12:34.394 --> 12:37.496
And you can call me all day
and all of the night.

12:39.466 --> 12:41.234
Look at you.

12:41.235 --> 12:44.303
So wise, so sexy, so sick.

12:44.304 --> 12:47.273
Brittany, okay, come on, now.

12:50.010 --> 12:52.612
Look, we want to know
what happened with The Dragons.

12:52.613 --> 12:54.247
Did you really hook up with our mom?

12:54.248 --> 12:56.616
Is that what that jackass told you?

12:56.617 --> 12:59.385
That's not even remotely
what happened.

13:03.957 --> 13:07.593
It was a warm, funky
Saturday afternoon in 1979.

13:07.594 --> 13:09.495
It was Soul Battle,

13:09.496 --> 13:12.999
Chicago's biggest and only
TV band competition show.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.735
The Dragons were on live TV,

13:15.736 --> 13:19.105
and if we won, we would've been
the opening act for Rick James

13:19.106 --> 13:22.008
on the East Coast leg of his tour.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.477
Now, your dad did see me talking
to your mom,

13:24.478 --> 13:25.978
but I wasn't coming on to her.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.047
I got too much respect
for her to do that.

13:28.048 --> 13:31.117
Although I was known as a bit of
a ladies' man back in the day.

13:31.118 --> 13:33.586
I can see that.

13:33.587 --> 13:35.321
Okay, okay, Brittany,
would you slow down?

13:35.322 --> 13:37.582
Stop being so thirsty and let
the man finish his story.

13:39.626 --> 13:41.861
But your dad was convinced
he saw what he saw,

13:41.862 --> 13:44.397
so he brought his anger onto stage.

13:50.671 --> 13:53.806
I started to do my
locally famous Dragon Hip Dip

13:53.807 --> 13:55.841
with the Soul Battle Girls.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.212
And that's when it happened.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.600
How you like that now, pretty bastard?

14:21.601 --> 14:23.903
Huh? Who got the hip moves now?

14:27.908 --> 14:30.076
Go on. I don't need none of y'all.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.844
Go on.

14:31.845 --> 14:34.347
So, that was the last time
that your father and I spoke.

14:34.348 --> 14:35.815
Until the other day...

14:35.816 --> 14:38.684
when we tried to choke each other.

14:38.685 --> 14:41.020
Okay, look, my dad says one thing,

14:41.021 --> 14:42.655
and then you say another thing.

14:42.656 --> 14:44.690
Look, one of y'all lying.

14:44.691 --> 14:46.592
- Hey, Nickels, you up?
- Yes.

14:46.593 --> 14:48.260
Come on in, man. Perfect timing.

14:48.261 --> 14:49.895
Ask them.

14:49.896 --> 14:51.864
Hey, these are Milton's sons.

14:51.865 --> 14:53.199
Wait, so you guys are the...

14:53.200 --> 14:54.700
These are the other three Dragons.

14:54.701 --> 14:56.402
I'm Mitchell.

14:56.403 --> 14:58.771
White Steve.

14:58.772 --> 15:01.407
Regular Steve.

15:01.408 --> 15:04.243
You all aged so well.
Can I be in the band?

15:05.278 --> 15:06.612
- Brittany.
- What, damn it?

15:06.613 --> 15:08.114
I'm single.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.415
Look, guys.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.250
I just need a few answers, for real.

15:11.251 --> 15:13.652
Now, which one of them
is the reason why The Dragons...

15:13.653 --> 15:14.720
It's your daddy's fault.

15:14.721 --> 15:16.789
100% your dad.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.724
Oh, your dad, man. He sucks.

15:26.524 --> 15:28.270
Okay, Dad look, we
talked to the Dragons.

15:28.271 --> 15:30.639
And they told us the reason why
you was kicked out the group.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.641
It wasn't for confronting Nickels.

15:32.642 --> 15:35.678
They kicked you out because
you acted really crazy onstage

15:35.679 --> 15:37.613
and ruined their chances
of opening up for Rick James.

15:37.614 --> 15:39.248
I tried to spare you the details, man.

15:39.249 --> 15:42.785
I'm a grown-ass man,
so I did what I had to do.

15:42.786 --> 15:44.753
He also let us know

15:44.754 --> 15:47.423
that he didn't come on
to Mom like that.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.959
So why you ain't just
ask Mom what happened?

15:49.960 --> 15:52.328
I did ask her, all right?

15:52.329 --> 15:55.130
- When we got home.
- And what'd she say?

15:55.131 --> 15:58.233
She said I was mistaken
and I owed Nickels an apology.

15:58.234 --> 16:02.705
But you know what?
I said, "What's done is done."

16:02.706 --> 16:05.240
And then I slept on the couch
for a week.

16:05.241 --> 16:08.310
So why won't you just apologize?

16:08.311 --> 16:11.981
Look, man, I just fought
with my friend on live TV.

16:11.982 --> 16:14.950
Yeah, I-I was in too deep.

16:14.951 --> 16:19.254
Hate to be real with you, Dad,
but that's just being petty.

16:19.255 --> 16:21.156
Look, Dad, you taught us, right,

16:21.157 --> 16:23.025
you taught us
to own up to our mistakes.

16:23.026 --> 16:25.294
The way Shannon left,

16:25.295 --> 16:27.262
I had to take a look at myself
in the mirror, right?

16:27.263 --> 16:29.365
And own up to the things I did.

16:29.366 --> 16:32.534
And I had to ask myself,
"What did you do?

16:32.535 --> 16:34.837
And what you gonna do
to make it better?"

16:34.838 --> 16:37.272
Now, look, I'm not trying
to be disrespectful, Dad,

16:37.273 --> 16:39.274
but you need to do the same thing.

16:39.275 --> 16:41.043
Oh, you going
right past disrespectful.

16:41.044 --> 16:43.145
You're on your way to insulting, okay?

16:43.146 --> 16:45.614
Dad, you got four guys

16:45.615 --> 16:47.316
that you got history with.

16:47.317 --> 16:50.052
And life is short. And you'll be sorry

16:50.053 --> 16:52.287
if you don't take this chance
to reconnect with them.

16:54.324 --> 16:58.193
Look, I-I wish I could go back
and make things different.

16:58.194 --> 17:00.395
- But it's too late.
- Well, Pop...

17:02.632 --> 17:05.534
...it might not be too late.

17:05.535 --> 17:07.770
Oh, what the hell is going on?

17:07.771 --> 17:09.538
Come on in, fellas.

17:12.008 --> 17:14.009
Nickels?

17:14.010 --> 17:16.377
You're out the hospital already?
I thought you were sick.

17:16.378 --> 17:19.314
We took care of that.

17:24.220 --> 17:25.988
I'm-a have a stent put
in my heart tomorrow.

17:25.989 --> 17:27.656
And because nothing is guaranteed,

17:27.656 --> 17:30.059
I figured I'd give you a chance
to apologize,

17:30.060 --> 17:32.661
because I was never flirting
with your girl.

17:32.662 --> 17:36.265
I was only telling her how
great of a man she has.

17:36.266 --> 17:39.368
Look, a part of me wishes
I hadn't attacked you

17:39.369 --> 17:42.237
on live TV
and, uh, destroyed the band.

17:42.238 --> 17:44.239
And, uh...

17:44.240 --> 17:46.341
um...

17:46.342 --> 17:49.378
I'm-I'm sorry.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.847
It was okay. It was only our career.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.184
And I can understand
why you might have thought

17:55.185 --> 17:56.819
I was flirting with your girl

17:56.820 --> 17:58.420
since I did sleep
with everybody else's girl.

17:58.421 --> 18:01.456
And Regular Steve's mom.

18:03.259 --> 18:06.328
Oh, it's cool. He asked first.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.401
Okay, now, look,

18:12.402 --> 18:15.604
this is all kind of weird,
this whole situation,

18:15.605 --> 18:19.374
but I am happy to see
The Dragons back together again.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.376
Well...

18:21.377 --> 18:24.546
...we're really not
back together unless...

18:24.547 --> 18:27.249
- One, two, three.
- Dragons!

18:28.651 --> 18:30.018
Yeah, it's gonna be funky.

18:32.756 --> 18:34.857
This is a little song I wrote
for all my many special ladies.

18:34.858 --> 18:37.726
- Mm-hmm.
- You know who you are, even if I don't.

I'm glad you're feeling better.

20:05.982 --> 20:09.351
Yeah, man. Your son said
take it easy on the sodium,

20:09.352 --> 20:11.320
but he ain't here.

20:11.321 --> 20:12.888
Harold, double soy sauce.

20:14.390 --> 20:16.391
You hear that, Harold?
They love you, man.

20:16.392 --> 20:18.727
You are the man.

20:18.728 --> 20:21.029
That's right. Here we go.

20:21.030 --> 20:23.232
Yes!

20:23.233 --> 20:26.435
You said double soy sauce, I got you.

20:26.436 --> 20:28.337
I'm gonna double the soy sauce.

20:28.338 --> 20:30.305
We're gonna get this shrimp started.

20:30.306 --> 20:31.740
All right,
I'm about to do this trick here,

20:31.741 --> 20:32.975
and I hope y'all are ready.

20:32.976 --> 20:34.743
This is my famous shrimp toss.

20:34.744 --> 20:36.511
You ready?

20:36.512 --> 20:39.281
No look.

20:48.324 --> 20:50.597
Come on, now. Come on.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.050
Come on, now.

21:00.774 --> 21:02.709
Sing it!
