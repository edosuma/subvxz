WEBVTT

00:25.240 --> 00:27.800
If he'd stuck to the diet,

00:27.840 --> 00:29.480
this would have been a whole lot easier.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.880
If he'd stuck to the diet, we wouldn't be here.

00:32.520 --> 00:34.800
My brother didn't listen to you

00:32.520 --> 00:34.800
when he was alive, either.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.880
And he sure as hell ain't listening to you now.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.280
Okay, fellas,

00:38.400 --> 00:42.000
this is not what Cedrik would have wanted.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.360
There's probably not a great deal

01:03.480 --> 01:05.320
I can tell you about Cedrik Verga

01:05.760 --> 01:07.520
that you don't already know yourselves.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.840
The barber shop was,

01:11.120 --> 01:14.720
and hopefully will continue to be,

01:11.120 --> 01:14.720
the hub of our community.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.760
-And the big man

01:19.040 --> 01:20.760
was the beating heart of the place.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.440
But it was his antics outside of work

01:23.560 --> 01:26.720
I think Cedrik will be remembered for.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.320
A rascal,

01:30.720 --> 01:33.120
and the party wasn't over until the fat man

01:30.720 --> 01:33.120
was on his back,

01:33.160 --> 01:34.280
passed out on the floor.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.440
There was another side to Cedrik, too.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.120
He was a caring man.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.000
A man who knew right from wrong.

01:47.560 --> 01:48.960
A man who would've given you the shirt off his back

01:49.000 --> 01:51.400
if the situation called for it.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.320
You know what you did for me, my friend.

02:13.840 --> 02:14.800
Dwayne.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.960
Cedrik was very proud of you, you know.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.520
I hope so.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.360
We thought we'd go back to the barber shop,

02:20.400 --> 02:22.480
have a beer there.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.040
Yeah, he'd like that.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.680
Sunny afternoon, a few beers,

02:26.840 --> 02:28.000
shooting the breeze.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.480
Hoping nobody wanted a haircut.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.880
You go ahead. I'll catch you up, yeah?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.080
Come.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.240
I'll see you later.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.440
Watch out for Dwayne.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.160
FLORENCE: Food is

04:02.560 --> 04:04.160
a demonstration of love.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.000
-FLORENCE: Of course.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.680
Women love men who can cook.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.560
Yes, sir, Florence is right.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.120
I made Rosey dinner the other evening.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.240
I thought she was going to propose.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.400
I can cook.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.720
-Mmm-hmm.

04:18.920 --> 04:19.960
Well-known for it.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.160
So, what's your signature dish?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
Shepherd's pie.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.040
-Shepherd's... -Shepherd's pie.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.560
Lamb mince, onions, carrots, peas, gravy granules.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.840
Mashed potato on the top, whack it in the oven.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.720
What are gravy granules?

04:33.920 --> 04:36.120
Gravy, in powdered form.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.880
Just have to add water.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.600
And you can eat it?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.480
Mmm-hmm. Or drink it in a mug, dip in a slice of bread.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.040
I think this might be tougher than we think.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.520
Dwayne! Um...

04:49.800 --> 04:51.120
I didn't expect you back today.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.800
Um, how was it?

04:53.440 --> 04:55.560
Well, obviously it was a funeral, so...

04:55.880 --> 04:59.240
I imagine it would be as good as a funeral can be,

04:59.280 --> 05:00.400
not good exactly,

05:00.440 --> 05:01.880
but, um...

05:01.920 --> 05:04.000
-Yes, Chief.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.240
Yes, of course.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.160
Mmm. Thank you.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.000
Well, it's a prank.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.280
In poor taste, perhaps, but still.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.200
But it's from Cedrik's phone.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.640
And I put the phone in his coffin myself.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.240
You put it in his coffin?

05:31.600 --> 05:32.640
It's an island thing.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.680
People get buried with their phones,

05:34.800 --> 05:36.240
so you can send them a last message.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.320
I see.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.720
You just don't expect any to come back the other way.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.800
Quite. When was it sent?

05:43.360 --> 05:46.880
Ten minutes after the funeral had finished.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.320
Right. So, Cedrik, the coffin and the phone are

05:46.920 --> 05:50.320
in the ground...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.760
Furnace. He was cremated.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
Ah.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.560
Isn't that a bit dangerous

05:58.280 --> 05:59.960
-Anyway,

05:58.280 --> 05:59.960
it doesn't matter now.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.480
And there was nothing suspicious about his death?

06:02.520 --> 06:04.280
No, he passed away in his sleep.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.280
The coroner confirmed it as natural causes.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.040
Uh, didn't you say he was a bit of a practical joker?

06:10.080 --> 06:11.520
He was.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.760
But why would he say he'd been murdered?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.640
Because you're a policeman?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.480
Maybe.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.680
You're not convinced.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.840
Chief, I've known Cedrik since I was 13 years old.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.680
Cedrik's jokes were rubber chickens

06:24.720 --> 06:27.560
and super-gluing your drink to the bar,

06:24.720 --> 06:27.560
not this!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.160
Not to me, no way!

06:29.200 --> 06:31.680
Okay. Let's think about this logically.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.920
Now, clearly, Cedrik himself couldn't have

06:33.360 --> 06:35.920
sent that message.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.520
He was dead. Agreed?

06:37.560 --> 06:38.960
Agreed.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.960
So, the simple fact is someone else

06:39.120 --> 06:40.960
must have sent it.

06:41.880 --> 06:42.840
And the question is,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.720
did they do it with or without Cedrik's prior knowledge?

06:45.760 --> 06:47.040
Now, if it is just a prank,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.160
it's in pretty poor taste if Cedrik wasn't involved.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.160
However,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.840
if he did set someone else up to send that text

06:50.200 --> 06:52.840
after his death,

06:53.040 --> 06:54.680
that would mean he knew he was about to die.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.120
Yet from what you say,

06:56.280 --> 06:58.320
he died unexpectedly in his sleep, so how could he?

06:59.360 --> 07:00.480
What?

07:02.040 --> 07:04.800
Cedrik gave me this a few days before he passed away.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.720
-I better be going, you know. -Mmm!

07:08.960 --> 07:10.120
DWAYNE: What?

07:11.800 --> 07:14.840
I want you to take this. Something to remember me by.

07:17.240 --> 07:20.920
Cedrik wore this every day. Never took it off.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.160
Wait, you think he gave it to you

07:23.200 --> 07:24.400
because he thought something was going to happen to him?

07:25.320 --> 07:26.680
Well...

07:26.720 --> 07:28.280
Then, why wouldn't he tell you when he was alive,

07:28.320 --> 07:30.840
rather than send a mystery text

07:28.320 --> 07:30.840
after his death?

07:31.640 --> 07:32.760
I don't know, Chief.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.600
None of this makes any sense.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.200
Look, like you said,

07:36.440 --> 07:39.120
it was a prank. Let's just leave it like that.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.840
-Forget it. -No, no, no, no, look.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.480
He was your friend. And maybe there's a small part of you

07:43.520 --> 07:45.000
that doesn't want let him go. And that's okay.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.920
Because, you know, friendship is important.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.880
I'll tell you what.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.920
Let's you and me go and take a little look.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.240
Shall we?

08:03.240 --> 08:05.040
That's Cedrik's barber shop, just there.

08:05.320 --> 08:06.960
-I thought he died at home. -He did.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.000
His house is just up the road there.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.080
Cedrik was never one for a long commute.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.960
So, who found him?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.880
Ottilie, his girlfriend.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.320
She lives up in the hills.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.640
How did you know him?

08:22.960 --> 08:26.080
Ah, I was about 13, 14.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.160
I was hanging out with the bad boys, you know?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.080
-Anyway, one night,

08:30.120 --> 08:32.400
we was passing by Cedrik's barber shop

08:32.440 --> 08:34.920
and noticed a window open round the side.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.760
Me being the smallest,

08:37.520 --> 08:39.560
I climbed in to case the joint,

08:39.720 --> 08:42.000
see if there was any cash or valuables lying around.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.120
You were a juvenile delinquent?

08:42.160 --> 08:45.120
Excellent.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.680
So, what happened?

08:46.760 --> 08:49.800
Suddenly, I felt a hand on my collar.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.800
Boom!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.400
It was pitch black.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.880
I couldn't see diddly-squat.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.320
Next thing I know, my feet are off the ground

08:55.360 --> 08:58.400
and I'm staring into the angry eyes of Cedrik Verga.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.960
He painted a picture for me.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.120
Where the road I was on would lead me

09:06.160 --> 09:07.840
or what could be possible if I put all

09:07.960 --> 09:09.640
my energy into something good instead.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.840
He gave me a simple choice that night.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.400
Either he went to the police

09:16.440 --> 09:18.800
or I changed my ways and worked in his barber shop

09:18.840 --> 09:20.840
every Saturday for free.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.480
Child labour. Good option.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.520
I didn't care. It changed everything for me.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.960
I started to take my studies seriously.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.480
Turned up for school.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.680
So Cedrik's the reason you're where you are now.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.120
He thought I could do better

09:36.160 --> 09:37.760
and I believed him.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.880
It's a very nice sentiment, Dwayne.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.320
We had a lot of good nights here,

09:41.960 --> 09:44.320
you know.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.960
Shall we go inside? Oh, yeah.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.680
Cedrik never had much time for keys.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.760
Liked to drink, though.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.520
There was an all-night vigil before the funeral.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.280
Turned into a bit of a party.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.960
-Yeah.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.280
-He was a big man. -He was.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.440
Who are this people with him?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.400
Father Floyd.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.160
Cedrik's brother Temmy. And Dr Ivann Tate.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.160
Ah. That's them as well.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.880
The Four Musketeers.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.840
They've been friends their whole lives.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.320
What's this?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.920
Cedrik had sleep apnoea.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.240
He had to wear that thing at night to keep

10:43.160 --> 10:45.240
his airways open.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.560
Sleep apnoea is when you stop breathing in

10:46.160 --> 10:48.560
your sleep, right?

10:48.600 --> 10:50.040
I think so.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.120
And then the brain realises it's not getting any oxygen

10:52.160 --> 10:53.640
and wakes you up with a start,

10:53.680 --> 10:55.280
at which point, hopefully, you start breathing again.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.000
That pillow is missing a case.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.440
Do you remember if it was like that

10:57.040 --> 10:58.440
last night?

10:58.520 --> 10:59.560
No.

10:59.680 --> 11:00.880
Well, from everything I've learnt,

11:01.560 --> 11:03.560
Cedrik didn't have the healthiest lifestyle.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.520
He was overweight. He had sleep apnoea.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.720
There was also something about his heart.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.840
Blocked arteries.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Too many cigars.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.560
So the likelihood is

11:12.680 --> 11:13.880
had to be natural causes.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.480
Hard to see past that, if I'm being honest, Dwayne.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.640
You're right, Chief.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.280
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.440
Three things bother me.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.600
One.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.160
Prank or not, of all the things

11:27.280 --> 11:28.600
to send in a message from the grave,

11:28.640 --> 11:30.680
"I was murdered" is pretty specific.

11:30.720 --> 11:31.960
Two.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.520
Why give you something to remember him by

11:33.560 --> 11:36.840
unless he thought he wasn't going to be around?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.720
-You said three. -Three.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.080
Why have only one pillow

11:44.800 --> 11:46.480
without a pillowcase?

11:49.080 --> 11:50.400
Right, drop me back at the shack.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.120
And then go home. Take some time, okay?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.880
If you can get the pillow to the lab on your way,

11:56.520 --> 11:58.760
tell them I asked if they could prioritise it.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.480
What am I asking them to look for?

12:04.800 --> 12:06.960
I've no idea.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.040
FLORENCE: Coroner's report

12:17.640 --> 12:20.040
on Cedrik Verga.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.200
Right.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.600
"Severe atheroma of all three major coronary arteries.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.640
"Such a degree of disease would, on balance

12:28.640 --> 12:31.640
of probabilities,

12:31.880 --> 12:34.400
"be sufficient to cause a cardiac arrhythmia

12:34.600 --> 12:36.760
"and sudden death consistent with

12:34.600 --> 12:36.760
the history available."

12:36.960 --> 12:41.040
Death certificate signed by Dr Ivann Tate.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.360
A life-long friend of Cedrik's.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.760
Ah, JP. How'd you get on with the door

12:46.840 --> 12:48.000
Anything of interest?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.080
Mainly a big outpouring of love.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.760
He was liked by everybody.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.760
I talked to the woman who lives above

12:51.800 --> 12:53.760
the barber shop.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.240
She said that Cedrik, his brother Temmy,

12:53.800 --> 12:57.240
Father Floyd and Ivann

12:57.280 --> 12:59.400
were downstairs the night Cedrik died.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.880
Said she heard raised voices around half midnight.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.000
-It's hard to say.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.120
She said they were always noisy

13:06.160 --> 13:07.800
and she didn't think much of it.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.040
So, Cedrik drinking with his friends

13:07.840 --> 13:10.040
like he always did.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.000
No doubt smoking, too, like he always did.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.480
Arteries clogging up. He goes home,

13:12.080 --> 13:15.480
he gets into bed,

13:15.520 --> 13:18.480
where the coroner says he suffered

13:15.520 --> 13:18.480
a cardiac arrhythmia

13:18.520 --> 13:20.880
and certain death consistent with a blah, blah, blah.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.480
-Pretty much.

13:24.520 --> 13:25.640
Honore Police.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.520
Just a moment.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.040
-The lab for you. -Right, the pillow.

13:34.280 --> 13:36.680
Last box to tick. DI Goodman.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.800
You're sure?

13:42.600 --> 13:44.240
Belonging to whom?

13:45.800 --> 13:46.960
Right.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.560
Conclusion?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.960
Yes. Yes, please.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.800
As soon as it's typed up.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.760
Thank you. Bye.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.600
Sir?

14:04.960 --> 14:07.720
The lab found saliva and sweat on the pillow,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.720
nothing unusual in that.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.160
But they were intrigued with the

14:09.280 --> 14:11.160
grouping, so they ran further tests.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.280
And they found

14:12.640 --> 14:15.320
DNA hotspots correlating to the

14:15.440 --> 14:18.280
location of the eyes, nose and mouth.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.160
DNA belonging to who?

14:21.240 --> 14:22.960
Well, they need to run further tests,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.160
but almost certainly Cedrik.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.520
But what does that mean?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.000
Well, this pattern wouldn't show up

14:29.040 --> 14:30.640
if he was simply resting his face

14:29.040 --> 14:30.640
on the pillow.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.720
It would require extreme pressure.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.720
It would need to be pushed down hard.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.080
Someone held it over his face?

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
Yes.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.240
Despite the coroner's report, despite his medical condition,

14:42.280 --> 14:46.120
it seems Cedrik's message from beyond

14:42.280 --> 14:46.120
the grave was true.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.440
He was murdered.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.120
DWAYNE: <i> So, it's true?</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:53.080
Cedrik gave me this because he knew he was

14:51.240 --> 14:53.080
going to be killed?

14:53.400 --> 14:56.360
Why would a man who knew he was

14:53.400 --> 14:56.360
about to be killed

14:56.400 --> 14:58.520
just accept it and do nothing to

14:56.400 --> 14:58.520
protect himself?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.000
And who sent the message?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.600
Why send the message?

15:01.640 --> 15:02.960
Why not just report it?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.880
You said his girlfriend discovered the body?

15:04.920 --> 15:06.080
That's right. Ottilie.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.760
Well, she's not a bad place to start.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.800
You're right, Chief.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.320
It's time to put back on my uniform.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.160
-JP, let's go. -HUMPHREY: Good.

15:15.200 --> 15:20.120
Florence, you and I should go and see these

15:15.200 --> 15:20.120
remaining Musketeers.

15:20.160 --> 15:22.880
Dwayne, I don't mean to pry but...

15:23.280 --> 15:24.640
-No.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.560
My lungs feel like they're about to explode.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.640
I meant about everything that happened.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.600
Just tell me to shut up if you don't want

15:29.680 --> 15:31.600
to talk about it.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.480
-Shut up. -Okay.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.360
You know it's weird,

15:35.880 --> 15:38.080
when Cedrik died, I felt so helpless.

15:38.560 --> 15:42.240
At least now it feels like I can

15:38.560 --> 15:42.240
finally do something for him.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.720
Yeah, cool.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.720
Wow. I had no idea this road was so long.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.640
And so steep.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.760
The clue's in the name, JP.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.040
Hill Rise. So Ottilie lives here?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.120
Cedrik was very much like me in that respect.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.720
What he lacked in assets he made up for in charm.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.760
Dwayne?

16:12.440 --> 16:15.000
FLORENCE: That's Cedrik's brother.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.000
He is the headmaster.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.240
-Temmy Verga. -DI Goodman, DS Cassell.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.400
-Pleased to meet you. -I'm sorry for your loss.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.480
Thank you.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.880
You said you wanted to talk about Cedrik?

16:23.920 --> 16:25.640
-Uh, yes, if that's all right. -Of course.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.520
I've asked Ivann and Floyd to come along

16:26.160 --> 16:28.520
as you requested.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.720
Thank you.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.600
Come this way.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.440
Last Tuesday around 10:00 a.m.,

16:36.720 --> 16:38.600
I got a phone call from the barbers,

16:38.840 --> 16:41.280
checking to see if Cedrik was with me.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.200
-No.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.480
I couldn't get hold of him on his phone

16:43.920 --> 16:47.480
so I went to his house.

16:48.760 --> 16:49.840
Cedrik! Cedrik.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.680
He was stone cold.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.640
It's the biggest regret of my life,

17:04.760 --> 17:06.560
not spending that last night with him.

17:08.040 --> 17:12.600
When you entered his house, nothing looked unusual?

17:08.040 --> 17:12.600
Out of place?

17:14.360 --> 17:17.080
How was Cedrik the week before he died?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.920
Same old Cedrik.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.880
A little quieter, maybe.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
His phone?

17:24.640 --> 17:25.840
The one I put in his coffin for him.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.080
Yes?

17:27.840 --> 17:29.920
Did anyone else touch it before you gave it to me?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.800
I don't think so.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.160
Look, Dwayne, you're really scaring me.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.160
Why are you here?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.480
Sorry, I'm late. Uh, Dr Ivann Tate.

17:45.720 --> 17:46.760
DI Goodman.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.440
-Father Floyd. -Father.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.360
What's going on?

17:50.880 --> 17:51.880
It's about Cedrik.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.280
There's some evidence that might

17:53.400 --> 17:54.760
suggest he didn't die of natural causes.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.280
We are considering all possibilities.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.080
He had sudden heart failure.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.600
Uh, yes, he did and we're trying

17:59.120 --> 18:01.600
to establish why.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.680
Wait. You're suggesting Cedrik was murdered?

18:05.640 --> 18:08.120
Actually, I haven't suggested anything yet.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.560
Do you gentleman know if anyone had

18:09.000 --> 18:11.560
a grudge against Cedrik?

18:12.040 --> 18:13.960
He was an affable sort of guy.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.000
Popular, laid-back.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.240
He didn't attract trouble.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.640
The night before Cedrik died, you

18:18.760 --> 18:20.240
were all with him at the barber shop.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.120
What was the occasion?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.080
Cedrik had arranged a game of poker.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.480
FLORENCE: <i>What time did you arrive?</i>

18:26.520 --> 18:29.440
VERGA: <i> Uh, around 8:00 p.m.?</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:31.800
Did Cedrik mention feeling unwell?

18:31.840 --> 18:34.760
Not at first. He said he felt unwell later.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.240
TATE: He was drunk.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.040
He was tipsy, Ivann. Not exactly falling over.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.960
We've got reports of raised voices

18:42.040 --> 18:44.080
around half past midnight.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.400
We'd... We'd gone by then, hadn't we?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.920
It wasn't an argument as such.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.160
Ivann and Temmy had just left,

18:53.480 --> 18:56.280
I was trying to persuade Cedrik

18:53.480 --> 18:56.280
to go home.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.280
He said he felt unwell. But he'd

18:58.400 --> 19:00.040
already cracked open another bottle.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.720
Kill or cure, as he used to say.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.520
And you tried to stop him drinking.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.520
Tempers flared?

19:06.600 --> 19:10.400
Hardly. It was a 30-second discussion,

19:10.720 --> 19:13.560
after which I left him to it and caught up with the others.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.960
Uh, Dr Tate, your name appears on

19:13.880 --> 19:16.960
the death certificate.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.800
Ottilie rang me when she found Cedrik.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.360
I raced over, so it fell to me to...

19:23.800 --> 19:25.240
to certify him dead.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.240
"Sudden death consistent with the history available."

19:28.360 --> 19:29.760
That's what it read on the report.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.680
Yes.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.440
And if there's been some sort of mistake,

19:34.040 --> 19:35.800
it's got nothing to do with me.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.400
I wasn't the pathologist.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.520
Poker night?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.760
Uh, yes, Cedrik organised a card

19:49.880 --> 19:51.360
game for his friends the night he died.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.120
And I wasn't invited?

19:54.960 --> 19:57.000
Now, I keep coming back to that question.

19:57.040 --> 20:00.440
If Cedrik knew his life was in danger,

19:57.040 --> 20:00.440
why not raise the alarm?

20:00.520 --> 20:02.800
Well, Ottilie thought he was quieter than normal.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.280
She tried to talk to him but he wouldn't open up.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.200
Uh, Dwayne, presumably you've known Cedrik's friends

20:08.240 --> 20:10.800
as long as you've known him. What else can you

20:08.240 --> 20:10.800
tell us about them?

20:11.080 --> 20:12.160
Uh, Father Floyd.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.040
Well, they all grew up together.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.640
When they left school, Floyd went to

20:14.080 --> 20:15.640
the seminary in Martinique.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.840
He came back in his late 20s, and took up his

20:15.960 --> 20:18.840
post in Honore.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Dr Ivann Tate.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.920
Ivann went to medical school in London

20:21.960 --> 20:24.080
before coming back to open up his practice here.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.880
I never heard Cedrik say a bad word about him.

20:27.040 --> 20:29.400
He's a nice man. Kind, compassionate.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.080
-My mother's.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.640
She speaks very highly of him.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.480
Which leaves us his brother Temmy.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.200
I guess he must have been the closest to Cedrik.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.320
Blood's thicker than water and all that.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.440
What?

20:42.480 --> 20:44.240
Well, back in the day, Ottilie and Temmy

20:42.480 --> 20:44.240
had been an item. We're talking

20:44.720 --> 20:46.480
childhood sweethearts.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.520
But we all kind of knew that Temmy thought she was the one.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.440
And then years later, Cedrik hooks up with her?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.760
-Difficult to know.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.880
My guess is that he took it all in his stride.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.280
He was the total opposite to Cedrik.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.080
Quiet. Never made a fuss.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.440
Even though his care-free brother's

21:02.560 --> 21:03.920
taken off with the love of his life.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.280
Sorry, Dwayne.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.840
Oh, um, Temmy got into a fight in a bar recently.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.160
He was given a caution.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.520
That can't be right.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.360
I would have known.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.120
It was a place on Sainte-Helene,

21:14.400 --> 21:16.120
two weeks ago.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.880
One week before Cedrik was killed.

21:20.480 --> 21:24.040
Hmm. All right, Dwayne, JP, I want you to go

21:20.480 --> 21:24.040
back to Cedrik's house,

21:24.080 --> 21:25.320
see if there any papers, anything that

21:25.440 --> 21:26.760
can tell us something we don't know.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.960
Chief.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.960
Florence, we need to speak to Temmy again.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.160
Back to school.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.600
Why go to a bar on another island?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.480
I went for a quiet drink.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.160
-Mmm-hmm.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.440
And then you got into a barroom brawl?

21:40.920 --> 21:42.520
That was unfortunate.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.520
Wrong time, wrong place.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.240
Anthony! Walk.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.400
We understand that you'd recently found out

21:49.440 --> 21:52.360
about your brother's relationship

21:49.440 --> 21:52.360
with Ottilie?

21:55.120 --> 21:57.760
Ottilie and I was a very long time ago.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.840
Cedrik did what he wanted to do.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.760
No one was going to stop him.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.040
But someone has stopped him, Temmy.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.480
The night he died, you attended his poker night.

22:06.720 --> 22:08.640
-It must be upsetting,

22:09.040 --> 22:10.720
Cedrik carrying on with his life,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.520
getting drunk, living it up.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.480
Meanwhile, you were on the sidelines,

22:14.600 --> 22:16.040
looking on as he gets the girl.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.640
Ottilie is not a girl.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.400
And I'm not some angst-ridden teenager.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.720
We're all grown-ups.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.320
Dwayne describes you as being quiet.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.320
Not one to make a fuss.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.800
Yet you're cautioned for fighting in a bar.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.000
What is that

22:31.040 --> 22:33.960
All that pent-up frustration, you just gotta let

22:31.040 --> 22:33.960
it out sometimes.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.720
I like your version of me.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.400
It's much more interesting than the truth.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.840
I may have loved Ottilie once.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.400
But I loved my brother more.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.120
HUMPHREY: How does it go?

22:52.520 --> 22:54.840
"Beware the wrath of a quiet man."

22:55.400 --> 22:57.480
I know where this is going, Chief.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.040
But Temmy hasn't got it in him.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.400
Look at the timeline.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.880
News drops about Ottilie's relationship with Cedrik.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.840
Temmy, completely out of character,

23:03.920 --> 23:07.840
gets caught up in a bar fight

23:07.880 --> 23:11.040
and less than a week later, Cedrik is murdered.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.080
Temmy would not kill his brother.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.360
I heard about the development in

23:15.480 --> 23:17.880
the Cedrik Verga case, Officer Myers.

23:18.400 --> 23:19.880
Most unfortunate.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.600
Thank you, Commissioner.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.200
Inspector Goodman?

23:24.320 --> 23:25.520
Yep.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.920
Cedrik Verga was an important part of all our community.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.120
He'll be missed.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.400
Yes, so I understand, sir.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.800
This message from the grave, it's a bad business.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.640
If it turns out to have been a prank,

23:45.520 --> 23:47.160
we all look very foolish.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.400
Yes, sir, and while I can't explain

23:47.480 --> 23:51.400
the mystery text message yet,

23:52.280 --> 23:55.480
I do believe that Cedrik

23:52.280 --> 23:55.480
Verga was murdered.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.400
You're sure?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.040
As I can be, sir.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.680
It's hard enough for Cedrik's friends to come to

24:03.360 --> 24:06.680
terms with his death.

24:06.720 --> 24:10.160
Then we have this whole anniversary

24:06.720 --> 24:10.160
business on top of that.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.800
Anniversary?

24:11.880 --> 24:14.320
It's 45 years since Hurricane Frances,

24:14.360 --> 24:16.760
we've got to remembrance ceremony this evening.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.640
It will be difficult for everyone

24:20.200 --> 24:22.880
but especially for Cedrik's friends.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.120
Why might that be, sir?

24:25.240 --> 24:26.760
They lost a friend.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.120
The night of the hurricane.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.840
I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.000
All I can ask is

24:33.040 --> 24:35.120
if feathers are to be ruffled,

24:35.760 --> 24:39.160
that you'll ruffle them as delicately as possible.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.440
Oh...

24:45.880 --> 24:47.200
And, uh,

24:47.240 --> 24:49.200
keep an eye on Officer Myers.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.440
We all know the story about the boy thief

24:51.480 --> 24:53.520
who grew up to become a policeman

24:53.560 --> 24:55.800
and how close he was to Cedrik.

24:55.840 --> 24:57.680
Yes, of course, sir.

25:03.440 --> 25:04.840
Trouble, Chief?

25:04.880 --> 25:07.760
Hmm? No, no, no. It's just,

25:04.880 --> 25:07.760
uh, you know, the usual.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.960
To be kept in the loop.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.000
Hurricane Frances.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.280
-Five.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.360
It's our biggest natural disaster.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.880
You know, one of the victims was close to

25:18.640 --> 25:21.880
Cedrik and his friends.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.400
Don't know.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.920
It's not the kind of thing people talk about.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.560
HUMPHREY: Right.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.080
Ah, here we are. A list of the causalities.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.640
Yes, four of them were grown-up

25:35.680 --> 25:36.960
and... Oh, yes, here we are.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.160
Vincent Garcia.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.080
"Vincent was as much a victim of the myth of Mont Clair

25:41.120 --> 25:42.960
"as the storm itself."

25:43.640 --> 25:45.360
What does that mean?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.120
What

25:49.160 --> 25:51.120
Do you want to know if you're going to Heaven

25:49.160 --> 25:51.120
or Hell, Chief?

25:51.360 --> 25:52.720
Not particularly.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.680
Then don't go up to Mont Clair in a storm.

25:56.360 --> 25:59.280
Ah! Yes, hi. If you just could

25:56.360 --> 25:59.280
leave that there.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.200
Uh, thank you. Yes.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.000
What's that?

26:03.120 --> 26:04.600
Well, I've been considering what you said yesterday,

26:03.120 --> 26:04.600
for once,

26:04.640 --> 26:07.040
about the food of love and all that and, uh,

26:07.160 --> 26:09.960
well, I've decided to test my culinary skills.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.440
And I'll be delighted if you three would be my guinea pigs.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.000
That would be... Nice.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.360
-Sure. -Good.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.320
There's a remembrance night in the square.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.080
For the victims of Hurricane Frances.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.760
Cedrik would want me to be there.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.360
Yes, of course. Yes.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.640
Oh, and you know, Dwayne, you still have, um,

26:28.680 --> 26:31.520
compassionate leave, you know. Feel free to take

26:28.680 --> 26:31.520
it if you want it.

26:33.280 --> 26:36.640
How about I catch up with you for dinner after

26:33.280 --> 26:36.640
this thing is over?

26:36.880 --> 26:38.600
Excellent.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.520
DWAYNE: Gentlemen.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.440
Dwayne.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.400
Cedrik would be ashamed of you, Dwayne.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.040
What?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.360
Divulging Temmy's

27:01.400 --> 27:03.760
personal affairs to your superior.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.040
I take it it was you?

27:06.160 --> 27:08.640
Look, nothing about this is personal.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.080
You're a traitor, Dwayne.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.800
There's still that question.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.720
Why did Cedrik not do anything to protect himself

27:29.760 --> 27:31.880
when it appears he knew he was about to be murdered?

27:32.120 --> 27:33.960
Maybe he did something wrong himself.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
If he told the police about the threat of murder,

27:36.520 --> 27:38.760
he'd have to confess about the reason for the threat.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.640
That doesn't really tie in with

27:40.760 --> 27:42.160
the whole Temmy jealousy motive

27:42.200 --> 27:44.480
but, uh, it's an interesting thought,

27:42.200 --> 27:44.480
Florence.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.760
Right.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.880
-Shepherd's pie.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.600
Thought I'd show you what I got.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.200
And I was hoping it might make Dwayne feel a bit better.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.840
I'm worried about Dwayne.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.600
Yes. Me, too.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.840
I mean, these weren't just Cedrik's friends,

27:58.880 --> 28:00.840
they were Dwayne's friends as well.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.360
It's all a bit too close to home.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.120
No, I'm worried about where he is.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.400
That remembrance ceremony finished ages ago.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.840
Maybe I should go and look for him.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.360
I think we should take the pie out.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.960
It's been in the oven for two hours!

28:42.000 --> 28:43.600
-Chief! -HUMPHREY: There you are!

28:45.080 --> 28:48.480
I've just seen Ottilie in a compromising

28:45.080 --> 28:48.480
situation with another man!

28:49.200 --> 28:52.840
News of our investigation is spreading.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.840
So I asked around.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.720
And she's been seen out and about

28:53.080 --> 28:55.720
with this new fella

28:55.760 --> 28:56.960
ever since Cedrik died.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.960
You think she might have been cheating on him?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.760
She obviously wanted him out of the way.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.920
And that gives her motive.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.200
You don't know that.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.640
Listen, Cedrik gave me this for a reason.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.560
Finally, this is something that makes sense.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.440
I'm going to have to catch her red-handed.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.840
How do you propose to do that?

29:13.040 --> 29:14.080
Surveillance.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.320
We haven't eaten.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.640
Not now. In the morning!

29:17.880 --> 29:20.520
Fine. Right now I think you ought to grab a chair,

29:20.560 --> 29:23.080
calm yourself down, come and partake

29:20.560 --> 29:23.080
of some of this.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.280
Finally.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.080
I thought it would have been burnt to a crisp by now.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.320
So did I.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.920
Schoolboy error. Easily rectified.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.120
Just give it another 40 minutes.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.840
Would anybody like some toast?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.560
-Morning, Florence. -Morning, sir.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.240
Oh, I've been thinking.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.520
If I'm going to woo the ladies with my culinary skills,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.840
I think I need to invest in a cookery book.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.240
I don't know.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.760
Maybe turning on the oven might be a good start.

30:15.800 --> 30:18.000
Yes, the devil is in the detail.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.640
Oh, what's this?

30:19.680 --> 30:20.880
It's addressed to Cedrik.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.680
Oh, yeah, the postman had heard about

30:22.720 --> 30:24.880
our investigation into Cedrik's death.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.320
So, he delivered that here.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.920
Right. Uh...

30:35.240 --> 30:37.000
It's a watch.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.440
It appears Cedrik ordered it on the 10th.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.120
Two days before Cedrik died.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.040
It's a shame. Yes, it is.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.280
It is a shame.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.760
It sort of undoes everything.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.440
Sorry?

30:55.480 --> 30:56.800
Well, I was working on the basis

30:56.920 --> 30:58.200
that Cedrik thought he was going to die.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.760
But why would you order a watch

30:59.800 --> 31:01.520
if you thought you were about to die?

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
In the box of Cedrik's paperwork.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.680
Love letters, by the look of it.

31:08.880 --> 31:09.840
Really?

31:10.760 --> 31:14.960
They're not signed but they're

31:10.760 --> 31:14.960
addressed to Father Floyd.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.560
Father Floyd's having an affair?

31:19.120 --> 31:21.760
Why would Cedrik have another man's love letters?

31:22.600 --> 31:24.080
Hang on.

31:24.120 --> 31:25.880
The argument between Father Floyd and Cedrik,

31:25.960 --> 31:27.320
supposedly about his drinking.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.320
You think it might have been about these?

31:29.840 --> 31:32.320
I think it's time we paid Father Floyd a visit.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.160
Come on, number two.

31:41.720 --> 31:45.680
I'm afraid I've got another funeral in 20 minutes.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.200
Well, I'm sure it won't take that long.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.120
Okay, we can see Ottilie's driveway from here.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.600
Do you really think

32:04.200 --> 32:06.200
Ottilie could have anything to do with Cedrik's death?

32:06.760 --> 32:09.320
It's just, you know, she seemed heartbroken

32:10.560 --> 32:11.920
when we spoke to her.

32:11.960 --> 32:15.000
People put on fronts, JP, happens all the time.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.760
She's on the move.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.680
Why did Cedrik have these letters, Father?

32:32.720 --> 32:35.560
I wanted his advice. I had no idea he'd kept them.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.360
He obviously knew about the affair.

32:38.160 --> 32:39.520
It was not an affair.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.040
Then, what was it?

32:41.560 --> 32:44.040
I fell in love with a parishioner.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.960
Cedrik told me I had a choice.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.440
Remain a priest or leave my vocation and be with her.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.200
That doesn't sound like Cedrik. I mean,

32:53.320 --> 32:54.840
he was a bit of a hedonist, wasn't he?

32:54.920 --> 32:56.800
Have a nice time and be damned with the consequences?

32:56.920 --> 32:59.200
These have got nothing to do with Cedrik's death!

32:59.240 --> 33:00.320
Murder.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.960
What was the argument about, Father?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.720
I've already told you.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.560
You had a pop at him for drinking too much.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.160
The thing is he always drank too much.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.160
That wasn't news to you.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.040
Was Cedrik becoming a little indiscreet, Father?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.400
-No. -Did you want

33:12.120 --> 33:14.400
your letters back?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.200
I loved Cedrik.

33:16.960 --> 33:20.200
He had more integrity than anyone I know.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.200
And I am not going to stand here and listen to you

33:24.520 --> 33:26.960
sully a good man's reputation.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.280
I'd like you to leave.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.080
What would happen if people found

33:34.200 --> 33:35.800
out Father Floyd was having an affair?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.240
Presumably he'd lose his job.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.600
It's not just that.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.440
People hold him in such high esteem.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.640
Yes, it would be an almighty fall from grace.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.040
If Cedrik decided to spill the beans,

33:47.160 --> 33:49.200
Father Floyd would lose everything.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.560
Whose house is that?

34:13.440 --> 34:15.440
Bingo. Ottilie's upgrade.

34:16.240 --> 34:17.440
Phone the Chief.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.600
Good afternoon. Inspector Goodman,

34:19.840 --> 34:22.600
Sergeant Cassell.

34:22.640 --> 34:23.920
Sorry to bother you but...

34:24.040 --> 34:25.440
Playing the part of the grieving widow

34:25.600 --> 34:27.720
then sneaking off to meet your toy boy?

34:29.680 --> 34:31.400
He looks after the lady who lives here.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.160
Sorry. Whose house is this?

34:33.760 --> 34:34.920
Mrs Garcia's.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.760
I thought Cedrik was sneaking off to see another woman.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.480
He only told me the truth about it when I

34:39.080 --> 34:41.480
challenged him.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.960
What is Cedrik's connection with Mrs Garcia?

34:44.120 --> 34:46.240
He was friends with her son.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.360
Vincent Garcia.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.280
"Vincent was as much a victim of the

34:49.400 --> 34:51.320
"myth of Mont Clair as the storm itself."

34:51.880 --> 34:53.520
The boy who died in Hurricane Frances?

34:53.640 --> 34:55.120
Mmm-hmm.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.160
Can we speak to her?

34:57.720 --> 35:01.200
She doesn't know that Cedrik has passed.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.200
Please don't tell her.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.240
Madam.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.280
Some friends of Cedrik's are here.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.600
They'd like to meet you.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.280
Pleased to meet you, Mrs Garcia.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.640
I'm Inspector Goodman. I'm here with my colleague,

35:13.080 --> 35:14.440
Officer Myers.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.200
Dwayne?

35:16.440 --> 35:17.560
That's right.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.840
Cedrik talks about you all the time.

35:21.240 --> 35:23.320
He's very proud.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.560
Don't fuss, Morgan, I'm fine.

35:29.440 --> 35:31.240
I believe Cedrik visits you a lot.

35:31.640 --> 35:36.360
Yeah, he understands. Time doesn't heal everything.

35:37.120 --> 35:41.720
He is the only person who still

35:37.120 --> 35:41.720
mentions my son's name.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.280
I'm very sorry about what happened to Vincent.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.440
I can picture them now.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.160
<i>Walking off down the road.</i>

35:50.120 --> 35:54.000
<i>Vincent wanted to</i> <i>go into the hills,</i>

35:50.120 --> 35:54.000
<i>into the rainforest.</i>

35:54.560 --> 35:58.040
<i>We hammered it into</i> <i>all of the children.</i>

35:58.520 --> 36:00.640
The mountain was out of bounds.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.600
<i>Vincent was so stubborn.</i>

36:05.360 --> 36:08.400
The others saw the storm coming and tried to stop him.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.920
Told him to come with them down

36:11.040 --> 36:13.000
to the jetty and hide under a boat.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.560
But he just ran off!

36:15.240 --> 36:18.040
The police searched for him for weeks

36:18.720 --> 36:21.800
but they never found his body.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.560
I don't think the other boys

36:25.120 --> 36:26.960
ever forgave themselves.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.280
Yes, when you say other boys...

36:29.320 --> 36:32.280
Cedrik and his three friends.

36:32.680 --> 36:33.720
Ivann...

36:33.840 --> 36:35.200
Floyd and Temmy?

36:36.720 --> 36:39.360
If Vincent had stayed with them,

36:39.760 --> 36:43.280
he would still be alive today.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.000
She needs to rest now. Come.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.120
What's wrong with her, Ottilie?

36:52.800 --> 36:54.480
She has pancreatic cancer.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.840
She's getting treatment?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.000
Palliative care.

36:58.440 --> 37:00.400
She'd be in hospital by now if it wasn't for Cedrik.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.800
What's it got to do with Cedrik?

37:02.560 --> 37:04.920
He organised for her medical

37:02.560 --> 37:04.920
bills to be paid.

37:05.520 --> 37:06.800
How could he afford that? I don't think he did it alone.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.720
He asked the others to help.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.280
How long has Mrs Garcia got?

37:11.680 --> 37:13.360
A few weeks at best.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.240
The cancer was at an advanced stage

37:16.360 --> 37:18.120
by the time they discovered it.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.200
Originally she was misdiagnosed with depression.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.680
By who?

37:23.760 --> 37:26.000
I don't think it's my place to say.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.480
It's a doctor, I presume?

37:29.360 --> 37:31.000
Dr Ivann Tate.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.080
Now, JP, could you run a financial check

37:34.880 --> 37:38.080
on Dr Tate, please?

37:38.120 --> 37:40.400
Florence, you and I should go speak with him in person.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.200
-Okay. -Now, Dwayne,

37:43.080 --> 37:45.120
this came in the post for Cedrik this morning.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.960
-He ordered it for himself.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.600
Cedrik hated watches.

37:49.640 --> 37:51.920
He said it made people watch their lives tick away.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.400
Yes, well, I quite agree with that.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.320
Well, maybe it was a gift for someone.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.320
What

37:55.360 --> 37:58.320
No, sir.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.720
Cedrik had more class than that, Chief.

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
Someone made a mistake.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.800
Right.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.880
Come on, Florence.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.000
JP?

38:12.920 --> 38:14.440
I'm going to tell you something now.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.280
You have to promise never to repeat it.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.880
I'm scared.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.640
I've looked up to these men my whole life

38:23.440 --> 38:27.080
and I'm just starting to wonder

38:23.440 --> 38:27.080
if I got it all wrong.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.360
Hey. If it's any consolation, Dwayne,

38:32.480 --> 38:34.640
I'm here for you.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.480
Thank you.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.840
HUMPHREY: We understand that you

38:47.960 --> 38:49.720
failed to spot Mrs Garcia's cancer.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.440
Is that why you decided to help foot

38:50.280 --> 38:53.440
her medical bills?

38:54.080 --> 38:58.200
I like the woman. She was the mother

38:54.080 --> 38:58.200
of an old friend of mine.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.320
Vincent?

39:00.440 --> 39:01.840
Yes.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.400
I believe that pancreatic cancer

39:04.520 --> 39:06.400
is notoriously difficult to diagnose.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.560
The symptoms are often confused with depression.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.960
That what I presumed. Why would you presume that?

39:12.480 --> 39:14.080
After losing her son,

39:14.120 --> 39:16.320
she'd suffered from depression for most of her adult life.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.480
I just thought it was getting worse.

39:18.640 --> 39:19.800
Any reason why it should?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.200
Old age. The anniversary.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.680
She often talked about dying without

39:25.800 --> 39:27.520
ever knowing what happened to Vincent.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.520
That's so sad.

39:29.560 --> 39:32.160
Cedrik suggested we pay for her care.

39:32.720 --> 39:35.400
In memory of Vincent.

39:35.960 --> 39:39.120
The truth is we were glad to do it.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.000
Chief? Dr Tate has been overdrawn at his bank

39:46.040 --> 39:47.760
for most of the past 12 months.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.320
He's also taken out a loan

39:49.440 --> 39:51.120
and all of his savings accounts

39:49.440 --> 39:51.120
have been emptied.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.800
Sounds like he's struggling to pay for Mrs Garcia's care.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
Maybe Cedrik was forcing his hand?

39:55.880 --> 39:58.480
Or Dr Tate was so genuinely racked with guilt

39:58.520 --> 40:01.200
about his misdiagnosis of Mrs Garcia.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.880
Still, it's completely disproportionate.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.880
There has to be more to it.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.800
Ottilie notices Cedrik is withdrawn.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.480
He then gives Dwayne a gold chain,

40:10.520 --> 40:12.840
saying that he wants you to have

40:10.520 --> 40:12.840
something to remember him by.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.280
All of this suggests he knows what's coming.

40:15.320 --> 40:19.680
Yet two days before his murder,

40:15.320 --> 40:19.680
he orders a cheap watch.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.480
You're sure Cedrik never wore a watch?

40:23.520 --> 40:24.600
Never.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.840
And neither do you, sir.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.120
Me? Of course not, there's no point.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.960
I mean, you just have to walk down the street.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.280
There are clocks everywhere.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.760
The town hall, the pharmacy's got one.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.280
I'm positively bombarded by time,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.280
I don't like it.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.840
No, I can't ever imagine a scenario

40:35.600 --> 40:38.840
where I'd need a watch.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.960
Well, say you're stranded on a desert island.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.560
Why would I need to keep track of the

40:42.680 --> 40:44.240
time on a desert island, JP

40:44.360 --> 40:46.400
Okay. Say you are held hostage.

40:46.440 --> 40:49.200
Chained to a radiator in a darkened room.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.160
You have no idea where you are...

40:51.200 --> 40:54.200
Knowing that it's quarter to 11 or not

40:51.200 --> 40:54.200
is not going to help me, JP.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.840
Actually, that's genius.

40:59.520 --> 41:02.560
JP, that is genius! That is why Cedrik

40:59.520 --> 41:02.560
bought the watch.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.040
Maybe he'd done something wrong himself.

41:05.080 --> 41:08.200
I want you to take this. Something to remember me by.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.840
Death certificate signed by Dr Ivann Tate.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.640
Four Musketeers. They've been

41:10.880 --> 41:13.640
friends their whole lives.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.560
HUMPHREY: How long has Mrs Garcia got?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.080
A few weeks at best.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.800
He had more integrity than anyone I know.

41:19.840 --> 41:20.920
It's a watch.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.080
Cedrik hated watches.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.480
I came to warn you. We're going to

41:24.600 --> 41:26.440
get hit by a Category 3 storm tonight.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.960
I've spoken with the harbour master, he says...

41:31.240 --> 41:32.280
Sorry.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.360
The myth of Mont Clair.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.680
What is it, exactly?

41:35.880 --> 41:38.800
Legend has it that if the eye of a storm

41:38.840 --> 41:41.000
passes directly over the island,

41:41.040 --> 41:43.760
the firmament opens up above Mont Clair

41:43.840 --> 41:46.680
and you'll get to see your final destination.

41:46.720 --> 41:47.800
Final destination?

41:47.920 --> 41:49.080
You get to see if you're going to...

41:49.120 --> 41:50.560
Heaven or Hell, brilliant.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.560
JP, you're the closest thing we have to a teenage boy.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.840
So, um, imagine, if you wouldn't mind,

41:54.960 --> 41:56.920
you're at the peak of your adolescent recklessness,

41:57.000 --> 41:58.680
surrounded by your closest buddies.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.760
A hurricane is due in a matter of hours.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.680
You've all heard the stories of Mont Clair.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.120
Wouldn't you be tempted to go on

42:02.720 --> 42:05.120
a bit of a Boys' Own adventure

42:05.160 --> 42:06.600
into the jungle?

42:06.680 --> 42:08.560
-Well, yes, of course you would.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.560
-Yes, yes, I would.

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
And if there were five of you and four of you

42:08.600 --> 42:10.600
didn't want to go,

42:10.640 --> 42:11.680
you wouldn't go off on your own.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.920
You're relating Cedrik's murder

42:14.040 --> 42:16.200
back to a 45

42:16.680 --> 42:19.880
Yes, sir. Yes, I think I am.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.480
I think those five young boys went up the mountain together,

42:22.520 --> 42:25.560
and if they did, they know what happened to

42:22.520 --> 42:25.560
Vincent Garcia.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.720
You think that's why Cedrik was murdered?

42:27.880 --> 42:29.960
Because he was going to reveal what he knew?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.280
Exactly.

42:31.400 --> 42:32.640
Even if that's true,

42:32.760 --> 42:35.240
why would Cedrik break his silence now?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.640
Because Mrs Garcia's condition was worsening.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.520
There was every chance that she was going to

42:37.720 --> 42:39.520
go to her grave

42:39.560 --> 42:41.440
not knowing what really

42:39.560 --> 42:41.440
happened to her son.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.480
I believe that Cedrik let it be known

42:43.520 --> 42:45.960
that he was going to confess about Vincent Garcia.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can I just get

42:46.000 --> 42:48.400
this straight, please?

42:48.560 --> 42:50.120
You're saying that Cedrik and his friends

42:50.160 --> 42:53.800
had something to do with Vincent

42:50.160 --> 42:53.800
Garcia's disappearance?

42:55.280 --> 42:57.000
Yes.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.240
And then you're saying Cedrik's brother and

42:57.040 --> 42:59.240
his closest friends

42:59.280 --> 43:00.640
turned on him and murdered him?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.840
Just say your scenario is true.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.400
How would you even start to prove it?

43:06.440 --> 43:08.120
Especially if they've gone to the length

43:08.160 --> 43:10.400
of killing Cedrik to keep their secret buried.

43:10.480 --> 43:13.640
The problem with this case has always been

43:10.480 --> 43:13.640
the lack of a body.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.160
Which isn't going to change.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.520
Yes, but if we could find Vincent Garcia's remains,

43:17.680 --> 43:19.960
I believe that we could solve Cedrik's murder.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.920
I searched that jungle with everybody else.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.200
How likely is it you'll find his body now?

43:26.240 --> 43:27.880
With the greatest respect, sir, that was

43:28.000 --> 43:29.640
45 years ago. Things have moved on.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.000
You know, we have sonar, 3D-imaging...

43:31.040 --> 43:33.680
None of which we have on the island.

43:33.720 --> 43:34.840
Please.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.080
Let us try.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.840
-Dwayne... -Shh!

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
Come, come, come!

43:57.800 --> 44:01.040
If anyone sees me here, I'm done.

43:57.800 --> 44:01.040
Career over. Come.

44:02.200 --> 44:03.400
How long have you known me?

44:03.520 --> 44:04.760
I don't know.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.480
About 30

44:06.520 --> 44:09.120
And we trust each other, right?

44:10.440 --> 44:15.040
If you know where Vincent Garcia's

44:10.440 --> 44:15.040
body is, please tell me.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.080
I think you should take some time out, my friend.

44:17.120 --> 44:19.720
I'm begging for your help here,

44:17.120 --> 44:19.720
you know, Father.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.280
Because the only thing I'm interested

44:21.400 --> 44:22.960
in right now is Cedrik's reputation.

44:23.840 --> 44:27.040
I don't want his good name linked to

44:23.840 --> 44:27.040
the death of a child.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.440
We cannot help you!

44:28.480 --> 44:30.640
We don't know what happened to Vincent Garcia!

44:30.680 --> 44:32.800
This is ridiculous.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.600
Because there's a 3D-imaging radar device

44:36.640 --> 44:39.000
being flown in from Martinique in the morning.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.200
And when this storm has passed?

44:41.240 --> 44:43.080
They're going to send it up into the jungle.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.760
And if there is a body up there,

44:46.880 --> 44:48.120
they're going to find it.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.120
Well, I hope they do. It will put a lot

44:48.600 --> 44:52.120
of minds at rest.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.320
Look, you sure about this?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.680
Yes, yes.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.800
-We have no choice. -Come.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.800
VERGA: If the river breaches,

45:27.000 --> 45:28.920
we'll never get back down again.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.320
This is as far as we can go in the car.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.960
What the hell was that?

46:14.440 --> 46:18.240
HUMPHREY: Dr Ivann Tate, Temmy Verga,

46:14.440 --> 46:18.240
Father Floyd Lynch.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.000
You're all under arrest for suspicion of murder.

46:21.160 --> 46:22.800
Dwayne, cuff them.

46:39.800 --> 46:41.360
A child's remains has been found

46:41.480 --> 46:43.320
at the site where you arrested the men.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.800
Sorry to be the bearer of such grim news.

46:48.520 --> 46:51.280
I'll go and break the news to Vincent Garcia's mother.

46:51.320 --> 46:52.560
Commissioner.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.440
I'd like to do that, please.

46:56.600 --> 46:58.560
That woman deserves an apology.

46:58.600 --> 47:02.280
And you have absolutely nothing

46:58.600 --> 47:02.280
to apologise for.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.040
Shall I get the suspects from the cell?

47:06.080 --> 47:07.320
Yes, please.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.880
Oh, and Ottilie Dubois.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.080
Can you call and arrange for her

47:10.200 --> 47:11.560
to join us at Cedrik's barber shop?

47:11.920 --> 47:13.560
Yes, Chief.

47:17.880 --> 47:21.720
HUMPHREY: This has been an especially

47:17.880 --> 47:21.720
hard case to solve. We began with an anonymous

47:22.120 --> 47:25.960
text message to Officer Myers...

47:26.520 --> 47:27.560
Dwayne.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.280
On further investigation,

47:30.280 --> 47:32.600
forensic evidence from Cedrik's pillow

47:33.680 --> 47:37.800
told us that he'd almost

47:33.680 --> 47:37.800
certainly been smothered.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.080
We believed that the killer had to be

47:41.000 --> 47:45.080
someone close to him.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.600
Yet we were dealing with three men who, ostensibly,

47:49.720 --> 47:53.880
loved and cared for the victim more than anyone

47:49.720 --> 47:53.880
else in the world.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.680
However,

47:55.760 --> 48:00.000
all three of you also had motives

47:55.760 --> 48:00.000
for murdering Cedrik.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.880
Father.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.920
You knew he had the knowledge and the evidence

48:03.960 --> 48:06.000
to bring your world crashing round your ears.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.640
He would never have used that against me.

48:08.680 --> 48:11.520
No, of course not, I don't think so, either.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.720
Temmy.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.480
You could only watch

48:15.520 --> 48:18.640
as the woman you'd held a torch

48:15.520 --> 48:18.640
for your whole life

48:18.760 --> 48:21.560
chose your brother over you.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.480
Finally, you, Dr Tate.

48:26.120 --> 48:27.760
You see, we couldn't believe

48:27.800 --> 48:31.360
that you'd hand over your life savings

48:27.800 --> 48:31.360
to Mrs Garcia

48:31.560 --> 48:33.640
because of a mistake that any doctor

48:31.560 --> 48:33.640
could have made.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.440
So, was there something else that

48:36.560 --> 48:38.920
made you pay for Mrs Garcia's care?

48:39.680 --> 48:41.040
Guilt, perhaps?

48:41.160 --> 48:42.600
No.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.200
The reason Cedrik was murdered

48:44.240 --> 48:46.760
had everything to do with the Garcia family, didn't it?

48:46.800 --> 48:48.160
All of us are happy to speak about

48:48.280 --> 48:49.560
what happened to Vincent Garcia.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.120
HUMPHREY: Mmm-hmm.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.960
As for it having anything to do with Cedrik's death...

48:53.040 --> 48:54.960
Tell us what happened to the boy.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.680
When the storm hit,

48:59.720 --> 49:01.720
we decided to take cover in the old boat

49:01.840 --> 49:03.760
we used to play on, under the jetty.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.320
But Vincent wanted to go up to Mont Clair instead.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.160
We tried to talk him out of it.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.160
But he wouldn't listen.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.520
This is very well remembered,

49:11.560 --> 49:13.840
bearing in mind how long ago all this happened.

49:14.640 --> 49:16.360
It's almost as though you've rehearsed it.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.120
How dare you?

49:18.160 --> 49:22.120
Perhaps you practised again last night after

49:18.160 --> 49:22.120
Dwayne left you?

49:24.920 --> 49:26.440
You think they fell for it?

49:29.320 --> 49:30.920
HUMPHREY: Let's go.

49:31.480 --> 49:33.840
The remains of Vincent Garcia

49:33.880 --> 49:37.640
were found on Mont Clair at dawn this morning.

49:39.320 --> 49:41.680
Three yards from where you were arrested last night.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.000
I mean, I hate coincidences at the best of times,

49:44.040 --> 49:45.400
but that is a humdinger.

49:45.440 --> 49:47.280
It's time for you to tell the truth.

49:47.520 --> 49:50.960
For all this time, a mother has been waiting

49:51.000 --> 49:53.520
to find out what happened to her child.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.200
And you have said nothing!

49:55.240 --> 49:59.120
Done nothing to alleviate her pain.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.280
It was an accident. Temmy...

50:01.840 --> 50:04.000
I've been carrying this around my whole life.

50:04.040 --> 50:06.000
We all have.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.320
It's weighing me down.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.400
<i>Vincent was younger than us.</i>

50:12.000 --> 50:13.320
<i>We used to tease him.</i>

50:14.360 --> 50:17.160
<i>Get him to do things</i> <i>just so we could laugh at him.</i>

50:18.480 --> 50:20.400
<i>We threw mangoes at him.</i>

50:24.240 --> 50:26.560
<i>I threw his hat</i> <i>into the river.</i>

50:27.600 --> 50:31.640
<i>Told him he had to</i> <i>go and get it back</i>

50:27.600 --> 50:31.640
<i>or his mother would be upset.</i>

50:34.160 --> 50:36.920
He fell and banged his head.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.920
We tried to save him.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.720
<i>We dragged him</i> <i>out of the river.</i>

50:51.640 --> 50:53.960
<i>But it was too late,</i> <i>he was already...</i>

50:55.240 --> 50:57.160
We didn't know what to do!

50:58.680 --> 51:00.640
We were told not to go up there.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.520
So we put him under the roots of a dead tree,

51:06.040 --> 51:10.600
covered him with whatever we could find

51:06.040 --> 51:10.600
and let the storm do the rest.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.520
We made up the story about him running away.

51:13.560 --> 51:14.880
We made a pact.

51:15.400 --> 51:16.800
-No.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.560
We decided in whatever capacity we could,

51:19.600 --> 51:22.640
we would give ourselves back to the island.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.720
We would atone.

51:23.760 --> 51:25.040
Yes, but more recently, it got to

51:25.160 --> 51:26.600
the point where this so-called atonement

51:26.640 --> 51:28.800
wasn't good enough for one of you, was it?

51:29.200 --> 51:32.760
What sort of state was Cedrik in before he died, Ottilie?

51:33.760 --> 51:36.440
He'd found out that Mrs Garcia was about to die.

51:36.480 --> 51:41.440
He was upset about that but I knew there

51:36.480 --> 51:41.440
was more to it.

51:42.560 --> 51:46.200
It felt like he owed her something.

51:46.240 --> 51:50.760
I wasn't sure what but I knew it

51:46.240 --> 51:50.760
involved his friends.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.600
Or at least Ivann.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.800
You sent that text, didn't you?

51:57.120 --> 51:59.280
I knew that something must have happened.

51:59.320 --> 52:00.840
The way he was with me.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.680
He kept saying how I'd be okay without him.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.040
He knew something was going to happen to him.

52:08.600 --> 52:13.160
<i>I took the SIM</i> <i>card out of his phone</i>

52:08.600 --> 52:13.160
<i>before I gave it to Dwayne</i>

52:13.760 --> 52:15.360
<i>to put in the coffin.</i>

52:16.040 --> 52:19.400
I honestly don't know why I sent that message.

52:19.880 --> 52:22.120
Part of me thought I was imagining things,

52:22.160 --> 52:25.560
that I was being foolish.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.800
I just knew something wasn't right.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.440
What would people think?

52:31.120 --> 52:34.400
What would people think if you openly pointed

52:31.120 --> 52:34.400
the finger at them?

52:34.440 --> 52:37.440
And say you were wrong. It had to be anonymous.

52:37.680 --> 52:41.200
And if they were prepared to silence him,

52:42.440 --> 52:43.920
well, then, maybe they'd do the same to you.

52:43.960 --> 52:47.920
For God's sake, Otti. No one is silencing anyone.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.760
See, all this time, I've been asking myself the question.

52:51.920 --> 52:53.360
Why Cedrik seemed so resigned to the

52:53.480 --> 52:55.240
fact that he was going to be murdered?

52:55.280 --> 52:59.080
Why? Why not raise the alarm, tell someone he

52:55.280 --> 52:59.080
was in trouble?

53:01.000 --> 53:04.200
The answer lay here. A cheap watch,

53:04.240 --> 53:07.360
purchased two days before he died.

53:04.240 --> 53:07.360
Why? It doesn't make sense.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.360
For a start, Cedrik never wore a watch.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.160
So why on earth would he buy one now?

53:11.600 --> 53:13.160
See, the sad fact is that Cedrik didn't

53:13.280 --> 53:14.920
think he was going to be murdered.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.200
I think...

53:16.440 --> 53:18.120
I think he was going to confess.

53:18.160 --> 53:21.800
Confess and let Vincent's mother

53:18.160 --> 53:21.800
die in peace,

53:22.600 --> 53:24.720
finally knowing what happened to her son.

53:25.640 --> 53:29.000
Cedrik didn't need a watch to see his life tick by.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.160
But he knew he'd need one in jail.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.240
They do say that not knowing the time

53:33.280 --> 53:36.200
can start to drive you a little crazy inside.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.760
Cedrik never thought he was going to get killed.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.200
He thought he was going to prison.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.480
And the gold chain?

53:44.040 --> 53:48.400
That was just a parting gift to someone he

53:44.040 --> 53:48.400
really cared about.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
Cedrik was ready to admit

53:54.640 --> 53:57.160
to a crime committed 45 years ago.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.720
And he was prepared to take his punishment.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.520
But you three weren't. And that is why he had to die.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.000
None of us would harm Cedrik. We loved him!

54:05.040 --> 54:06.880
I would never hurt him.

54:10.560 --> 54:12.720
You've been awfully quiet, Father.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.280
I imagine it's hard.

54:15.480 --> 54:18.640
<i>Standing every</i> <i>day in that pulpit,</i>

54:15.480 --> 54:18.640
<i>preaching the word of God.</i> And every day, having to live

54:19.800 --> 54:22.960
with the truth of what you've done.

54:23.320 --> 54:24.840
Of all of you,

54:26.920 --> 54:29.520
I imagine you had the most to lose.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.800
Am I right?

54:33.160 --> 54:34.680
It wasn't them.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.600
I killed Cedrik.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.040
But why, Floyd?

54:41.080 --> 54:45.120
Because all we did was play a game.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.800
It wasn't fair that he was going to take away everything,

54:48.840 --> 54:51.760
just because of a woman who was dying anyway.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.640
He told me what he was going to do.

54:54.760 --> 54:57.480
After the poker, that's why we argued.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.360
When I got home, I couldn't stop

54:57.920 --> 55:00.360
thinking about it.

55:00.480 --> 55:03.720
What we'd lose. All of us! And for what?

55:04.200 --> 55:07.520
So, I went to see him, to talk sense into him.

55:08.200 --> 55:10.880
<i>But when I got there,</i> <i>he was fast asleep.</i>

55:11.520 --> 55:14.120
I had heard Ivann talking to him,

55:14.160 --> 55:15.720
saying how if he wasn't careful,

55:15.840 --> 55:17.440
he'd have a heart attack one day,

55:17.480 --> 55:20.000
just go to sleep and never wake up.

55:21.320 --> 55:25.320
I found myself picking up the pillow...

55:45.440 --> 55:46.480
FLORENCE: Stop!

55:56.320 --> 55:57.680
You know, Dwayne,

55:58.360 --> 56:00.080
in the end, all the good things Cedrik

56:00.200 --> 56:02.200
did is what brought the truth to light.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.560
People loved him.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.320
It's what made Ottilie send that text.

56:05.360 --> 56:07.600
It's what made you want to find out the truth.

56:07.640 --> 56:08.760
As you sow, so shall you reap. Exactly.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.600
You know, Chief, I've been thinking

56:12.720 --> 56:14.320
about this whole atonement thing.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.240
I mean, Ivann became a doctor.

56:16.280 --> 56:18.960
Then there was a priest, a teacher.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.240
I wonder how Cedrik had atoned?

56:22.280 --> 56:23.640
Well, he was the only one who tried

56:23.760 --> 56:25.040
to keep Vincent's memory alive.

56:25.080 --> 56:26.120
Hmm...

56:27.120 --> 56:29.320
I think it might be why he helped me,

56:27.120 --> 56:29.320
too, you know.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.720
I daresay it was.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.440
Although...

56:33.120 --> 56:34.640
Generally speaking,

56:34.840 --> 56:38.240
I think that good people tend to gravitate

56:34.840 --> 56:38.240
towards good people.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.040
That's why we make a good team.

56:41.080 --> 56:44.640
Hey, surely that goes without saying, Dwayne.

56:45.560 --> 56:46.800
Anyway, thank you, Chief.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.240
Thank you

56:48.280 --> 56:49.720
Listening to me.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.120
Well...

56:53.720 --> 56:56.840
Come on. Got some cold

56:53.720 --> 56:56.840
beers in the fridge.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.200
Yes, aye.

57:03.880 --> 57:07.640
The oven was definitely on this time.

57:03.880 --> 57:07.640
I checked myself.

57:08.440 --> 57:10.080
Ho ho ho!

57:10.480 --> 57:11.920
Shepherd's pie.

57:12.120 --> 57:15.840
And this time, it is piping hot.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.240
Great, gravy and mash.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.920
Just the sort of thing you want to eat

57:20.040 --> 57:21.880
when it's 96 degrees in the shade.

57:22.720 --> 57:23.800
What?

57:24.200 --> 57:26.800
It smells... I don't know.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.920
Good?

57:29.200 --> 57:30.760
This is my mum's recipe.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.000
She gave it to me when I went to university.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.120
Stopped me from getting scurvy.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.600
And the beauty of this is...

57:39.800 --> 57:41.280
you only need a fork.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.960
Less washing up.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.400
Now, before we start, a toast.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.960
To absent friends.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.760
JP: To absent friends.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.080
Tuck in!

57:58.320 --> 58:00.360
Mmm... Wow!

58:00.440 --> 58:01.720
This is good!

58:02.160 --> 58:04.000
Like, really good.

58:04.040 --> 58:07.120
DWAYNE: If this doesn't wow the ladies,

58:04.040 --> 58:07.120
Chief, I don't know what will.

58:08.520 --> 58:09.880
Aunt Mary!

58:11.560 --> 58:13.760
HUMPHREY: <i> Aunt Mary was</i> <i>always my most favourite aunt.</i>

58:13.840 --> 58:15.440
FLORENCE: <i> Well, she</i> <i>witnessed the victim's death</i>

58:15.480 --> 58:17.600
<i>and she's saying it</i> <i>wasn't an accident.</i>

58:17.640 --> 58:19.080
And you think that that man's death

58:19.200 --> 58:20.800
might have something to do with me?

58:20.960 --> 58:23.400
The Commissioner says he's going

58:20.960 --> 58:23.400
to show me the sights himself.

58:23.520 --> 58:26.600
It's a sacrifice I'm prepared to make.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.680
This is the police! Who's there?
