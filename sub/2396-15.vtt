WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.365
I DIDN'T KILL CYRUS,
KEITH.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.634
I FOUND THIS BUG
IN MY CELLPHONE.

00:07.640 --> 00:08.766
DID YOU PUT IT THERE?

00:08.770 --> 00:10.431
NO, HAN K.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.277
YOU LIKE THAT?! HUH?!

00:14.280 --> 00:17.204
HE SAYS
SHERIFF LAMB'S DEAD.

00:18.550 --> 00:21.417
MAINTENANCE WORKERS FOUND A BAG
OF BLOODY CLOTHES ON CAMPUS.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.548
THE SHIRT BELONGS TO
YOUR BOYFRIEND, HANK LANDRY.

00:24.550 --> 00:28.156
EITHER YOU'RE COVERING FOR HIM
OR HE'S COVERING FOR YOU.

00:28.860 --> 00:31.454
Veronica: SO, HERE'S SOMETHING
THE FRESHMAN GUIDEBOOK

00:31.460 --> 00:33.599
FAILED TO ADDRESS --
YOUR DAD IS ACTING SHERIFF,

00:33.600 --> 00:35.329
HE THINKS YOUR
FAVORITE PROFESSOR

00:35.330 --> 00:37.195
MAY HAVE MURDERED
YOUR FAVORITE DEAN,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.428
SO WHERE DO YOU SIT IN CLASS?

00:38.430 --> 00:40.034
UP FRONT NOW SEEMS AWKWARD.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.532
BUT ISN'T A SEAT IN THE BACK

00:43.540 --> 00:45.303
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
RELOCATING.

00:45.310 --> 00:48.199
OH, PROFESSOR. NO.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.905
NO.
I WAS JUST, UM --

00:49.910 --> 00:51.104
I KNOW, VERONICA.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.476
IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD
SITUATION,

00:53.480 --> 00:56.187
BUT I-I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT THIS DISAGREEMENT

00:56.190 --> 00:57.612
THAT YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE HAVING

00:57.620 --> 00:59.611
WILL IN ANY WAY AFFECT THINGS
BETWEEN US.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.384
A STUDENT LIKE YOU
COMES ALONG ONCE,

01:02.390 --> 01:03.926
MAYBE TWICE, IN A CAREER.

01:03.930 --> 01:07.491
I'M GLAD THAT I GET TO BE
THE ONE TO MENTOR YOU,

01:07.500 --> 01:10.128
AND I REALLY HOPE
THAT YOU DON'T FORGET THAT

01:10.130 --> 01:11.427
AMID ALL THIS...

01:11.430 --> 01:14.558
I WON'T.
THANKS, DR. LANDRY.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.037
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
KEITH.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.177
SHERIFF MARS, ACTUALLY.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.148
I AM ACTING SHERIFF NOW.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.004
OKAY.

01:25.010 --> 01:26.409
"SHERIFF."

01:26.420 --> 01:29.071
WHY AM I STILL HERE
BEING QUESTIONED BY YOU

01:29.080 --> 01:32.516
IN THAT TONE OF VOICE?

01:32.520 --> 01:35.057
ALL OVER CYRUS'
COMPUTER KEYBOARD.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.051
STEVE WAS CLEARLY
UNSTABLE.

01:37.060 --> 01:39.392
YOU FOUND HIS PRINTS
ON THE KEYBOARD.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.426
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU PEOPLE
CALL A SMOKING GUN?

01:42.430 --> 01:47.163
"GOODBYE, CRUEL WORLD."
THAT SENTIMENT USES 11 LETTERS.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.434
UNSTABLE EX-HUSBAND
STEVE'S PRINTS

01:49.440 --> 01:51.567
ARE ON EVERY KEY
ON THE KEYBOARD.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.936
AND, OF COURSE, THERE'S
THE MATTER OF THE GLOVES

01:53.940 --> 01:58.104
FOUND IN THE INCINERATOR.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.772
ONLY TO TAKE THEM OFF

02:00.780 --> 02:04.238
SO, NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE CALL A SMOKING GUN.

02:04.250 --> 02:07.811
I DIDN'T KILL CYRUS,
KEITH!

02:07.820 --> 02:11.324
SHERIFF MARS.

02:11.330 --> 02:12.627
AT THE NEPTUNE GRAND

02:12.630 --> 02:14.996
ON THE EVENING
OF YOUR HUSBAND'S DEATH,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.467
BUT A WITNESS
HEARD TWO MEN

02:16.470 --> 02:19.189
FIGHTING IN YOUR ROOM
AT MIDNIGHT.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.758
YOU SAY YOU NEVER LEFI'
THE HOTEL,

02:20.770 --> 02:23.330
BUT AT 1:30, YOUR CAR
IS CHECKED OUT OF VALET

02:23.340 --> 02:25.228
AND CHECKED BACK IN
AN HOUR LATER.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.470
IN THAT TIME,
A PHONE CALL IS MADE

02:27.480 --> 02:29.641
BETWEEN YOUR CELL
AND LANDRY'S.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.709
YOU CLAIM YOU NEVER LEFI'
THE HOTEL

02:31.710 --> 02:33.849
AND THIS CALL CONCERNED
TOOTH PASTE.

02:33.850 --> 02:36.580
ROUGHLY 30 MINUTES AFI'ER
YOUR CAR IS CHECKED BACK IN,

02:36.590 --> 02:39.047
A STUDENT PASSING NEAR
YOUR HUSBAND'S WINDOW

02:39.050 --> 02:42.429
HEARD THE GUNSHOT.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.557
HAD A LARGE DOSE OF XANAX
IN HIS SYSTEM.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.755
THE DEAN'S ASSISTANT
SAID HE WAS OUT,

02:46.760 --> 02:49.297
BUT RECORDS SHOW YOU PICKED UP
A REFILL PRESCRIPTION

02:49.300 --> 02:51.222
FOR HIM EARLIER
IN THE EVENING.

02:54.670 --> 02:58.902
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP
TO ME, MINDY.

03:03.680 --> 03:07.218
I BELIEVE HANK LANDRY KILLED
YOUR HUSBAND, MRS. O'DELL.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.539
I BELIEVE I CAN PROVE IT.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.518
MY QUESTION TO YOU
IS THIS --

03:10.520 --> 03:12.909
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE THE FALL
WITH HIM?

03:19.230 --> 03:22.267
THE MAN WHO CAME
TO THE HOTEL ROOM --

03:22.270 --> 03:24.693
THAT WAS CYRUS.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.029
HE WAS FURIOUS.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.462
HE HAD A GUN.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.904
PUT THE GUN DOWN, CYRUS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.229
OH, "CYRUS"?

03:33.240 --> 03:34.878
OH, WE'RE ON A FIRST-NAME
BASIS NOW?

03:34.880 --> 03:37.576
I CAN SEE HOW YOU MIGHT BE
CONFUSED ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP,

03:37.580 --> 03:39.673
WHAT WITH YOU SLEEPING
WITH MY WIFE AND ALL.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.477
LET ME REMIND YOU,
I'M YOUR BOSS.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.311
PLEASE, PUT THE GUN DOWN.
THEN WE'LL TALK.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.548
CYRUS, PLEASE.

03:44.550 --> 03:48.452
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.825
I MEAN EVERYWHERE.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.889
NO TENURE, NO MORE HAPPY DAYS
IN ACADEMIA,

03:51.890 --> 03:55.223
BEDDING IMPRESSIONABLE STUDENTS
AND EASILY CHARMED WIVES.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.425
CYRUS, PLEASE.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.762
HANK'S CAREER MEANS
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

03:59.770 --> 04:03.069
CYRUS COULD KILL HIM
AT EVERY REPUTABLE COLLEGE

04:03.070 --> 04:07.336
IN THE COUNTRY.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.400
I SAID THAT I WOULD GO
AND TRY AND TALK HIM DOWN.

04:10.410 --> 04:13.277
I WENT TO THE HOUSE,
BUT HIS CAR WASN'T THERE,

04:13.280 --> 04:14.941
SO I WENT BY HIS OFFICE.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.281
AND THE PHONE CALL?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.144
HANK WANTED TO KNOW
HOW IT WENT.

04:18.150 --> 04:22.211
HOW DID IT GO?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.222
SO HE WASN'T
IN A GOOD MOOD.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.754
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.969
I'M HERE TO ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME, CYRUS,

04:29.970 --> 04:31.619
TO PLEASE BE MERCIFUL.

04:31.630 --> 04:34.360
THAT'S WHEN YOU GAVE HIM
THE XANAX?

04:34.370 --> 04:36.804
I THOUGHT IT WOULD DO HIM
SOME GOOD.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.904
THREE PILLS PRACTICALLY
LEFI' HIM HELPLESS.

04:39.910 --> 04:43.505
I JUST GAVE HIM THE BOTI'LE.
HE HANDLED THE DOSAGE.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.740
LOOK, I WAS THERE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.686
HE YELLED, I LEFI' --
END OF STORY.

04:58.530 --> 05:00.896
WHAT DID YOU TELL HANK?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.390
NOTHING.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.994
WHEN I GOT BACK,
HE WASN'T THERE.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.332
YOU CAME TO ME TO PROVE
YOUR HUSBAND WAS MURDERED.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.309
IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO YOU THAT
YOUR LOVER MIGHT HAVE DONE IT?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.676
I KNEW THAT CYRUS
DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.638
I WANTED TO KNOW WHO DID,
EVEN IF IT WAS HANK.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.005
YOU PROVIDED HIS ALIBI.

05:17.010 --> 05:18.841
UNTIL YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
HANK'S BLOODY CLOTHES,

05:18.850 --> 05:21.546
I BELIEVED SOMEONE ELSE
WAS RESPONSIBLE.

05:21.550 --> 05:24.314
CYRUS HAD PLENTY
OF ENEMIES.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.619
YOU'LL TESTIFY HANK
WAS WORKED UP,

05:27.620 --> 05:31.158
THAT HE PANICKED AT THE THOUGHT
OF LOSING HIS CAREER?

05:31.160 --> 05:32.923
YES.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.362
YOU'VE KNOWN THREE MEN
IN YOUR LIFE, MRS. O'DELL.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.591
TWO ARE DEAD,

05:41.600 --> 05:44.364
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT
TO THAT?

05:44.370 --> 05:45.735
REFLEXIVELY.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.675
YOU'RE A WITNESS NOW,
MRS. O'DELL.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.844
DON'T LEAVE TOWN.

05:54.350 --> 05:56.614
MANY AGENCIES REQUESTING
CRIMINAL PROFILES

05:56.620 --> 06:01.410
ARE UNIFIED BY THE MISPERCEPTION

06:01.420 --> 06:05.652
OF ANALYZING PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
ON A PARTICULAR CASE...

06:07.860 --> 06:09.498
UH...

06:09.500 --> 06:13.698
REVIEW CONDUCTED
BY HORVATH AND MESSIG

06:13.700 --> 06:15.691
DETERMINED
THAT PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

06:15.700 --> 06:18.430
IS USED LESS THAN 25%
IN THE CASES --

06:18.440 --> 06:20.032
[ DOOR OPENS ]

06:21.640 --> 06:25.041
ALL RIGHT, THEN. MAY I ASK
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

06:25.850 --> 06:27.909
I'm going to arrest you,
Dr. Landry.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.548
You_ should feel free
to dIsmIss your class.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.484
There's no need
for the students to see you

06:32.490 --> 06:34.685
led out of here in cuffs.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.282
CLASS, THE ACTING SHERIFF
HAS SOME QUESTIONS

06:39.290 --> 06:41.258
HE'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT A CASE,

06:41.260 --> 06:44.297
SO I'M GONNA LET YOU GO EARLY.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.861
READ CHAPTER 6 BY NEXT CLASS.

06:54.040 --> 06:58.044
* A LONG TIME AGO,
WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

06:58.050 --> 07:03.716
* BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU
LATELY AT ALL *

07:04.420 --> 07:06.513
* COME ON, NOW, SUGAR *

07:06.520 --> 07:08.715
* BRING IT ON, BRING IT ON,
YEAH *

07:08.720 --> 07:12.554
* JUST REMEMBER ME WHEN *

07:12.560 --> 07:16.826
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS
A LONG TIME AGO *

07:16.830 --> 07:19.663
* WE USED TO BE FRIENDS *

07:23.970 --> 07:27.804
SAY IT AGAIN, PLEASE,
INTO THE MICROPHONE.

07:29.080 --> 07:33.176
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.247
MINDY FLIPPED ON YOU.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.808
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

07:37.820 --> 07:40.948
SHE SAYS SHE WENT BACK TO
THE DEAN'S OFFICE THAT NIGHT.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.827
SHE TALKED TO HER HUSBAND,
GAVE HIM HIS XANAX.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.492
WHEN SHE GOT BACK,
YOU WERE GONE.

07:47.530 --> 07:50.966
THE DEAN WAS MURDERED
AT 3:00 AM.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.768
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
A LAWYER?

07:55.070 --> 07:58.801
MINDY SAID THE DEAN
VISITED YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.699
SHE SAYS HE THREATENED
TO DESTROY YOUR CAREER,

08:01.710 --> 08:04.770
AND SHE WENT BACK TO HIS OFFICE
TO TRY AND PLEAD FOR YOU.

08:04.780 --> 08:07.010
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.847
THAT'S ALL SHE SAID
ABOUT HIS VISIT?

08:11.020 --> 08:12.817
WELL...

08:12.820 --> 08:15.357
THE DEAN DID MORE
THAN THREATEN ME.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.726
NO MORE HAPPY DAYS
OF ACADEMIA,

08:17.730 --> 08:19.618
BEDDING DOWN
IMPRESSIONABLE STUDENTS

08:19.630 --> 08:22.827
AND EASILY CHARMED WIVES.

08:22.830 --> 08:24.718
YOU WILL FIND YOUR THINGS
ON THE LAWN

08:24.730 --> 08:28.188
TOMORROW MORNING, OKAY?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.964
ABOUT MARRYING YOU,

08:30.970 --> 08:34.201
WE ARE DONE, AND YOU GET
NOTHING, YOU HEAR ME?!

08:34.210 --> 08:35.677
NOTHING!

08:35.680 --> 08:37.602
SHE DIDN'T GO BACK
TO SAVE ME, KEITH.

08:37.610 --> 08:39.612
SHE WENT BACK
TO SAVE HERSELF.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.769
SHE WAS BACK AT THE HOTEL

08:40.780 --> 08:42.338
BY THE TIME THE DEAN
WAS DEAD.

08:42.350 --> 08:43.783
THE EX-HUSBAND -- BOTANDO.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.883
IT'S NOT LOOKING
LIKE BOTANDO.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.154
A MAINTENANCE WORKER
FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING

08:48.160 --> 08:50.720
WHILE CLEANING OUT
THE INCINERATOR AT HEARST.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.654
YOU WANT TO FILL ME IN?

08:53.660 --> 08:55.127
A BAG...

08:55.930 --> 09:00.492
...CONTAINING A DRESS SHIRT
AND GLOVES -- YOURS --

09:00.500 --> 09:03.264
COVERED IN O'DELL'S BLOOD.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.269
MINDY.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.817
SHE SET ME UP.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.584
SHE CAN GET TO MY CLOTHES.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.650
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE GOT HER CAR
BACK TO THE HOTEL, BUT --

09:20.660 --> 09:25.450
HER ALIBI CHECKS OUT.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.996
THE NIGHT
OF DECEMBER 10th?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.299
I LEFI' THE HOTEL
AND DROVE HOME ALONE.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.664
I STOPPED AT A CONVENIENCE STORE
FOR CIGARE'ITES.

09:34.670 --> 09:36.137
YOU CHARGE THEM?

09:36.140 --> 09:37.402
NO.

09:38.470 --> 09:42.076
AND THE CLERK DIDN'T EVEN
LOOK UP FROM HIS LITI'LE TV SET.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.175
WAIT.

09:46.550 --> 09:48.973
CAN I BUM ONE OF THOSE?

09:50.650 --> 09:53.414
HERE. TAKE TWO.

09:53.420 --> 09:54.682
I DON'T REALLY SMOKE.

09:54.690 --> 09:55.987
SO, THIS MYSTERY WOMAN --

09:55.990 --> 09:58.356
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT HER?

09:58.360 --> 10:00.453
LATE 30$, EARLY 40$.

10:00.460 --> 10:01.927
BRUNE'I'I'E.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.296
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU CAN TELL ME
HOW YOUR CLOTHES

10:04.300 --> 10:06.063
ENDED UP COVERED
IN THE DEAN'S BLOOD?

10:06.070 --> 10:10.860
I SUGGEST YOU FIND A LAWYER --
A VERY GOOD ONE.

10:10.870 --> 10:14.874
YOU'RE A SMART MAN.
YOU GOT TO SEE I HAVE A CASE.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.382
Tim: PROFESSOR LANDRY.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.449
[ SIGHS ]

10:25.450 --> 10:27.611
TIM. OF COURSE.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.757
IT'S ALWAYS TIM.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.887
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:30.890 --> 10:33.256
THEY THINK
YOU KILLED THE DEAN.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.625
I DIDN'T.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.394
THEIR CASE IS...

10:39.400 --> 10:40.867
[SIGHS] JUST --

10:40.870 --> 10:43.361
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
YOU CAN DO, THOUGH.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.469
I FOUND A BUG
IN MY PHONE.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.574
A BUG?

10:50.580 --> 10:52.275
AND HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN THERE.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.373
Okay.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.745
What else?

10:55.750 --> 10:59.982

OF COURSE.

[ CHUCKLES ]

35:13.040 --> 35:14.837
CAN YOU PICK UP
MY DRY CLEANING?

35:16.810 --> 35:18.801
[ CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ]

35:20.150 --> 35:22.448
SO, AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,

35:22.450 --> 35:26.648
UH, PROFESSOR LANDRY
IS NO LONGER WITH US.

35:26.650 --> 35:30.450
I WILL BE YOUR INSTRUCTOR
FOR THE TIME BEING.

35:30.460 --> 35:32.985
SO IF YOU'LL TAKE YOUR HANDOUTS
FROM THE WEBBER TEXT --

35:32.990 --> 35:34.799
YES?

35:34.800 --> 35:35.994
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:36.000 --> 35:39.424
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:39.430 --> 35:41.364
CAN'T WE DISCUSS THAT?

35:41.370 --> 35:45.238
I MEAN,
THIS IS CRIMINOLOGY, RIGHT?

35:45.240 --> 35:47.435
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD
FOR ME...

35:50.940 --> 35:52.271
...BUT OKAY.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.249
THIS IS CRIMINOLOGY.

35:55.250 --> 36:00.040
SO, LANDRY KILLS O'DELL.

36:00.050 --> 36:02.951
A CRIME OF PASSION?

36:02.960 --> 36:04.825
OPPORTUNITY?

36:04.830 --> 36:05.979

36:05.990 --> 36:09.391
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.322
DEAN O'DELL'S WIFE, MINDY,

36:11.330 --> 36:13.798
AND LANDRY WERE ENGAGED
IN AN AFFAIR.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.337
THE DEAN CAUGHT THEM,
THREATENED TO RUIN THEM,

36:16.340 --> 36:19.366
DESTROY LANDRY'S CAREER.

36:19.370 --> 36:20.667
IS IT TRUE HE GOT THE IDEA

36:20.670 --> 36:22.877
FROM ONE OF OUR
PERFECT -MURDER PAPERS?

36:23.740 --> 36:25.378
POSSIBLY.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.701
AGAIN, OPPORTUNITY.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.611
THE IDEA IN THIS PAPER
PROBABLY SUITED THE SITUATION.

36:30.620 --> 36:33.180
HE KNEW HE HAD A LIMITED
WINDOW TO ACT.

36:33.190 --> 36:36.250
HE KNEW THE DEAN WAS DRUNK
AND UPSET,

36:36.260 --> 36:39.980
AND HE HAD A GUN.

36:39.990 --> 36:44.529
SO A FAKE SUICIDE SUITED
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

36:44.530 --> 36:47.499
ANY CHANCE THE DEAN'S WIFE
HELPED SET HIM UP?

36:47.500 --> 36:52.233
HE WAS DRUGGED, RIGHT?

36:52.240 --> 36:55.107
NOW, IS IT POSSIBLE
THEY COLLUDED?

36:55.110 --> 36:56.975
YES.

36:56.980 --> 37:03.215
WILL WE EVER KNOW?

37:03.220 --> 37:04.778
LANDRY WAS A SMART MAN,

37:04.790 --> 37:07.042
BUT THE BLOODY CLOTHES
HE THOUGHT HE INCINERATED

37:07.050 --> 37:11.589
GOT STUCK IN A CHUTE,

37:11.590 --> 37:14.354
ANOTHER INTERESTING THING
ABOUT THIS CASE

IS ONCE A PERPETRATOR

37:17.130 --> 37:20.167
THE SLOPPIER HIS WORK BECOMES.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.865
THEY FIND THE BLOODY CLOTHES,

37:21.870 --> 37:26.261
SO LANDRY FIRST TRIES TO FRAME
MRS. O'DELL'S EX-HUSBAND,

37:26.270 --> 37:28.329
AND THEN,
WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED --

37:28.340 --> 37:32.140
IN THIS ROOM,
AS YOU ALL REMEMBER --

37:32.150 --> 37:34.038
HE FAKES AN ALIBI.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.347
HOW?

37:35.350 --> 37:36.715
HE CALLED A WOMAN WHOSE SON

37:36.720 --> 37:39.211
HE OVERSAW IN THE JUVENILE
PROBATION BOARD.

37:39.220 --> 37:43.919
IT MIGHT HAVE WORKED, ACTUALLY,

37:43.920 --> 37:46.684
AGAIN -- CHANCE.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.818
IF YOU REMEMBER
FROM READING HOLST,

80% OF --

37:54.300 --> 37:56.029

37:56.040 --> 37:57.860
WHEN?

37:57.870 --> 37:59.132
UH, WHEN WHAT?

37:59.140 --> 38:01.005
WHEN DID HE CALL HER?

38:01.010 --> 38:02.409
LANDRY WAS ARRESTED HERE

38:02.410 --> 38:04.708
AND TAKEN STRAIGHT TO
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.

38:04.710 --> 38:08.316
WHEN DID HE HAVE THE TIME
TO MAKE THE BLACKMAIL CALL

38:08.320 --> 38:12.381
TO FAKE HIS ALIBI?

38:12.390 --> 38:14.210
THAT HE AND MINDY COLLUDED.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.517
SHE COULD HAVE CALLED
WHILE --

38:15.520 --> 38:17.283
IT WAS A MALE VOICE
ON THE PHONE.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.087
THEN IT'S POSSIBLE
HE CALLED EARLIER,

38:19.090 --> 38:22.548
ANTICIPATING HIS ARREST.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.460
KNEW HIS CRIME
HAD BEEN EXPOSED.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.495
HE KNEW MINDY
WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION

38:26.500 --> 38:30.038
AND HAD SENT HER CHILDREN
TO RELATIVES IN ENGLAND.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.362
HE COULD EASILY HAVE ASSUMED
THAT SHE HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM.

38:33.370 --> 38:36.737
ANYWAY, IN 80% OF CASES,

38:36.740 --> 38:40.642
[CLEARS THROAT]
THE BREAKTHROUGH EVIDENCE WAS --

38:40.650 --> 38:45.747
WAS OBTAINED OUTSIDE
THE USUAL POLICE PROTOCOLS...

38:45.750 --> 38:49.880
WHICH IS AN INTERESTING
POINT OF -- OF HOLST,

38:49.890 --> 38:52.757
I THINK, HE MAKES HERE,
IS THAT...

38:55.200 --> 38:56.929
VERONICA?

38:58.530 --> 39:01.328
HOW DID YOU KNOW SHE SENT
HER KIDS TO ENGLAND?

39:01.330 --> 39:02.661
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

39:02.670 --> 39:04.809
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SURE, BUT --

39:04.810 --> 39:06.630
SO WHOEVER BUGGED
LANDRY'S PHONE

39:06.640 --> 39:09.575
KNEW THAT THE DEAN CAUGHT
MINDY AND LANDRY TOGETHER

39:09.580 --> 39:11.901
AND THAT THE DEAN WAS DRUNK
IN HIS OFFICE?

39:11.910 --> 39:14.242
WELL, IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING
BOTANDO KILLED THEM,

39:14.250 --> 39:16.639
IT'S POSSIBLE.

Oh, my God.
Did you hear what she just said?

YES, IF THEY LISTENED --

39:26.230 --> 39:28.755
TO ALL THE TAPES...

YOU DID.

39:33.570 --> 39:36.038
I'M NOT SURE
I UNDERSTAND.

39:37.370 --> 39:38.860
WHEN MY DAD
CALLED TO TELL ME

TO RELATIVES IN ENGLAND,

THREATENED HIM.

WAS ZONKED OUT ON XANAX

THEN BETRAYED YOU.

AN ALIBI, YOU FAKED IT,

HE'D GO DOWN...
