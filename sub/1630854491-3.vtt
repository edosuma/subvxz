00:16.975 --> 00:19.436
-[gasps] Wow, Ugga!

00:19.477 --> 00:22.063
You're tearing through
those tartichokes.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.107
You've got some real
tarti-chops.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.692
Glad I invited you to help me.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.818
-Well, like you said,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.112
it was do this
or never eat again, so...

00:29.154 --> 00:30.363
-Works every time.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.365
It's actually how I got
Phil to propose.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.700
-Oh, sounds romantic. So,
why do you

00:33.742 --> 00:35.577
So, why do you love
these things so much?

00:35.618 --> 00:38.872
-The first bite is sour,
but then it gets really sweet.

00:38.913 --> 00:39.998
I just connect with them.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.583
-Hard to imagine why.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.461
-[gasps] Ah! Grug.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.588
-Did you eat my tartichokes?
-[chewing, swallows]

00:46.629 --> 00:49.507
-What? No! Why would
you even think that?

00:49.549 --> 00:50.717
* *

00:50.759 --> 00:54.054
Yes. I ate them all!
Why are they so sour?!

00:54.095 --> 00:55.847
-Hope, maybe you
should go harvest

00:55.889 --> 00:57.057
somewhere with fewer Grugs.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.641
-Good call.
-Mm-hmm!

00:58.683 --> 01:00.727
Doesn't seem like you're
having a lot of luck here.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.688
[Grug sighs]

01:03.730 --> 01:06.191
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.442
-Until our baskets are full.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.402
-But that's gonna take forever!

01:09.444 --> 01:12.864
[chomps, chews, burps] Oh...

01:12.906 --> 01:14.115
-With you doing that? Yes.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.368
So, why don't you
go do anything but this?

01:16.409 --> 01:18.787
-Can I go do anything <i>but</i>this?

01:18.828 --> 01:20.121
-Yes. I just said that.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.624

Grug! You saved my life!

01:46.398 --> 01:48.608
-Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's
why I'm here.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.361
Not to eat your tartichokes,
that's for sure. [quiet laugh]

01:51.403 --> 01:52.112
-Wait, what happened
to my tartichoke?

01:52.153 --> 01:54.197

02:28.189 --> 02:29.482
-GRUG: Rock!
-EEP: Leaf!

02:29.524 --> 02:31.234
And leaf
beats rock again,

02:31.276 --> 02:33.570
which means I beat you. Again.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.989
-Gah! Why is this
game so hard?!

02:36.031 --> 02:37.282
-Cake break!

02:37.323 --> 02:39.784
-And why am I not
already eating that cake?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.161
-Sorry, Dawn.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.413
This cake is just for Grug
because he saved my life.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.165
-Aw, you really didn't
have to do this, Hope.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.334
But since you did...

02:47.375 --> 02:49.836
-So, if I save your life,
I get my own cake?

02:49.878 --> 02:52.422
-Not just cake.
Because Grug saved my life,

02:52.464 --> 02:54.466
-I'm beholden to him.
-Good to know.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.677
-And I be holdin' this cake...
in my belly!

02:57.719 --> 03:01.014
-No! Grug, "beholden"
means I owe you.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.058
-You see, Grug? On this farm,

03:03.099 --> 03:05.518
we believe in returning favors.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.312
You know, you scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.690
-In my day, we didn't
scratch backs!

03:10.732 --> 03:13.693
It was an eye for an eye,
tooth for a tooth!

03:13.735 --> 03:17.364
So if any of you skin-bags
need an eye or a tooth,

03:17.405 --> 03:19.741
you know where to find me!

03:22.285 --> 03:24.746
-Anyway, I mean every
kind of action

03:24.788 --> 03:27.499
must be met with a corresponding
reaction.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.709
For instance,
if Dawn were to clear my plate,

03:29.751 --> 03:31.711
I would be obliged to
return the favor

03:31.753 --> 03:34.339
with a kindness of equal value
to make things even.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.757
It's called "the even-ing."

03:35.799 --> 03:37.509
-The evening? So it's
a night thing?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.053
-No, not evening. Even-ing!

03:40.095 --> 03:41.388
-Yeah. Night.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.556
-Moving on. It's a Betterman
tradition.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.809
Of course,
Hope's dedication

03:45.850 --> 03:48.561
to this tradition
is a bit more... exhaustive.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.480
-You don't have
to do this, Hope.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.565
I saved your life 'cause
that's what Croods do.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.485
-And this is what Bettermans do.
Now, eat up!

03:55.527 --> 03:58.738
-Oh, I-I couldn't. Really.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.781
Hm...

04:06.538 --> 04:08.415

might help you relax!

04:08.456 --> 04:10.291
-Oh. Um, great. Thanks.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.795
-[snore]
-Chimes...

04:13.837 --> 04:16.339
-Are you asleep?
-I was until you woke me up.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.299
-Sorry. I'll get more chimes.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.386

04:21.428 --> 04:22.637
-Are you asleep now?
-Ah!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.806
You can see my eyes
are open, right?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.266
-Oops! More chimes coming up!
-No, I don't need...

04:26.307 --> 04:29.477
[sighs] Forget it. Forget it.

frightened of all the eelgles.

-Aw!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.628
-[gasps] Was that a uneelgle?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.255

Why didn't you catch it?

05:03.553 --> 05:06.765
-Okay. I just need
a little entrance over here,

05:06.806 --> 05:10.435
touch of moss over
there, and done!

05:10.477 --> 05:13.146
[laughs] Oh, you're a
drafty little guy,

05:13.188 --> 05:14.689
aren't you, Dampy?

05:16.024 --> 05:18.276
Took me forever,
but my mini-cave collection

05:18.318 --> 05:19.652
is finally complete.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.321
[sighs] Time for a cake break.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.371
[singing to himself]

05:29.412 --> 05:32.874
Aah! My mini-caves.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.334
-Oh. Hi, Grug.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.378
I washed all your dirty rocks.
You're welcome.

05:37.045 --> 05:37.879
[gasps]

05:39.214 --> 05:41.383
-[echoing]
<i>Dampy!</i>

05:42.550 --> 05:44.344
Why won't Hope leave me alone?

05:44.386 --> 05:45.428
-Sure. Having someone
waiting on you

05:45.470 --> 05:47.764
hand and foot is rough.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.767
-You don't get it.
Hope follows me everywhere.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.186
She never stops.
She's like a duck-cricket.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.771
[quacking, chirping]

05:54.813 --> 05:57.899
-You're being dramatic.
She's not here now,

05:57.941 --> 05:58.858
-is she?
-Ah!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.528
-Grug, can I sing
you a lullaby?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.155
-Why? I'm not trying to sleep!
I'm standing up!

06:04.197 --> 06:07.409

06:15.375 --> 06:16.918
Good night!

06:17.460 --> 06:19.337
[panting]

06:19.379 --> 06:21.756
Boop! Pillow?

06:21.798 --> 06:22.924
-Ah!

06:27.053 --> 06:28.263
[growls]

06:28.304 --> 06:31.516
[grunting, yelling]

06:31.558 --> 06:33.476
-Why are you hitting
Grug's pelt?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.061
Especially when he's not in it.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.271
[grunts]

06:36.312 --> 06:37.564
-I'm cleaning it, Phil!

06:37.605 --> 06:38.982
Or I'm trying to,

06:39.024 --> 06:41.443
but I think
it's more dust than pelt.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.653
Anyway, Grug saved my life,

06:43.695 --> 06:45.572
and I'm gonna
even things up if it kills me.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.324
-[grunting, panting]
-Hope, Grug absolved you.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.659
You owe him nothing.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.578
-You know that's not
how our system works, Phil.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.997
We always return favors.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.206
[sighs]

06:55.248 --> 06:57.042
-Perhaps we should rethink
"the even-ing."

06:57.083 --> 06:59.169
-You mean because "the even-ing"
also means night?

06:59.210 --> 07:02.047
-Not the name. The system.
The name is flawless!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.007
-Phil, we can't change
the system!

07:04.049 --> 07:07.052
If we forgo rules and order,
society will collapse.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.888
We might as well just
live in caves and wear pelts.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.513
* *

07:10.555 --> 07:11.598
Pelts! [grunting]

07:11.639 --> 07:13.892
Will! [grunts] Never! [grunts]

07:13.933 --> 07:16.770
Be! [grunts] Clean!
[grunting, panting]

07:16.811 --> 07:19.689
So I guess I'll just have
to keep doing favors for Grug

07:19.731 --> 07:22.734
until things are even
again. [sighs]

07:23.401 --> 07:24.235
Uh... [gasps]

07:24.277 --> 07:26.488
-Phil?! Ah!
-Better idea!

07:26.529 --> 07:28.406
-Phil!
-Grug saved your life,

07:28.448 --> 07:30.116
so you must save Grug's life.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.451
It's the only way to return
the favor in full.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.828
-Yes! You're right!

07:33.870 --> 07:35.830
And then Grug
can clean his own pelt!

07:35.872 --> 07:37.916
-Or not clean it, I guess.
-Yes!

07:37.957 --> 07:40.752
It will be a perfect even-ing.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
-We're doing this at night?
-Not evening! Even-ing!

07:43.421 --> 07:45.632
-Not hearing the difference.
And finish that pelt for me.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.550
-Thanks.
-[shudders]

07:47.592 --> 07:51.388
Aah! [coughing]

07:54.432 --> 07:57.102
Ugh... Grug dust.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.144

Mm!

-GRUG/THUNK: Yes!
-What's going on in here?

08:05.193 --> 08:09.072
-We're making history, Hope,
and you've got a front row seat.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.615
-If I catch one more bug nugget,
it'll be a new record.

BOTH: Yes!

08:36.641 --> 08:39.102
-Congratulations.

-Okay, Sandy, let's check out
your aim game.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.690

in the air,

08:43.732 --> 08:45.608
-you spear it.
-[growling]

08:45.650 --> 08:47.652

08:51.698 --> 08:53.283
Oh no.
There's sap on this target!

08:53.324 --> 08:55.452
It's stuck to my hand!
Sandy, don't throw!

08:55.493 --> 08:56.327
-Don't throw!
-[growls]

08:56.369 --> 08:59.039
[panting]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.331
[grunting]

09:00.373 --> 09:02.208
-This is too easy.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.668
Grug! Look out!

09:03.710 --> 09:05.712
UGGA: Grug! Sandy! I
found a bone pile!

09:05.754 --> 09:09.049
-Bone pile? I love bone piles!

09:09.090 --> 09:10.467
[grunting]

09:10.508 --> 09:11.843
-[gasps] Sandy!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.386
-No! Wait!
-[growls]

09:13.428 --> 09:14.387
[screaming]

09:14.429 --> 09:15.805
Oh!

09:17.766 --> 09:22.854
[Grug humming]

09:25.482 --> 09:26.649
[dramatic sting]

09:26.691 --> 09:28.735
-This is it, Hope.
Time to get even.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.696
Grug! Watch your step!

09:33.198 --> 09:35.200
[grunting]

09:35.241 --> 09:35.867
[gasps, grunts]

09:35.909 --> 09:38.870
[grunting, panting]

09:43.708 --> 09:47.087
[normal speed yelling]

09:47.128 --> 09:49.631
-[Grug humming]
-Phew! That was close.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.717
[screaming]

09:52.759 --> 09:55.720
-So, do you like your
new treehouse, Philliam?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.807
What's that?
You want an elevator

09:58.848 --> 10:00.475
because you don't have knees?

10:00.517 --> 10:01.768
Not to worry, Philliam.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.186
I'll help you up the stairs.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.731
<i>* Walking up the stairs</i>
<i>with my stick legs *</i>

10:06.773 --> 10:09.526
-HOPE: Phil!
-[screams, nervous laugh]

10:09.567 --> 10:10.944
I give up. I tried your idea,

10:10.985 --> 10:12.862
but every time Grug
is about to die,

10:12.904 --> 10:14.989
someone or something saves him!

10:15.031 --> 10:16.950
So, new idea. I need your help

10:16.991 --> 10:19.285
putting Grug's life
in <i>certain</i>danger.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.830
-Yes!
I've been plotting Grug's demise

10:21.871 --> 10:23.998
ever since that intolerable
ignoramus

10:24.040 --> 10:26.084
dragged his knuckles
into our lives!

10:26.126 --> 10:28.044
-I don't wanna kill him, Phil!

10:28.086 --> 10:30.839
I want to <i>almost</i>kill him,
so I can save his life.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.882
Natural peril is too
unpredictable.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.885
-I can't say I'm
not disappointed,

10:35.927 --> 10:37.846
but my plan should still work.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.974
And it's the perfect crime.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.809
<i>At every meal, I shall steal</i>

10:42.851 --> 10:45.061
<i>a tiny portion of food</i>
<i>from Grug's plate.</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:47.313
<i>Over time, the slight drop</i>
<i>in daily nourishment</i>

10:47.355 --> 10:49.816
<i>will cause Grug to</i>
<i>slowly weaken.</i>

10:49.858 --> 10:52.027
That's where phase two begins!

10:52.068 --> 10:54.154
<i>To maintain the ruse,</i>
<i>I'll decrease the weight</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:57.073
<i>of everything Grug encounters</i>
<i>by an imperceptible amount.</i>

10:57.115 --> 11:00.076
<i>Unaware of his</i>
<i>diminished strength,</i>

11:00.118 --> 11:02.579
<i>Grug will become vulnerable.</i>

11:02.620 --> 11:03.747
Are you with me so far, Hope?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.248
-Not even a little.
-Excellent!

11:05.290 --> 11:08.209
Now, phase three
is where things get interesting.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.794
-We're not doing that, Phil.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.422
It's too complicated,
and it'll take forever!

11:12.464 --> 11:13.840
Why don't you just
roll a boulder at him

11:13.882 --> 11:15.216
and I'll push him
out of the way?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.886
-[sighs] But that's so simple,
Grug could do it.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.929
-That's why it will work!

11:20.972 --> 11:22.682
-Okay, Phil.
The pie is in place.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.184
Once Grug catches its scent,

11:24.225 --> 11:26.227
he'll come running.
I'll give you the signal,

11:26.269 --> 11:28.772
you push the boulder, and I'll
shove Grug out of the way.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.816
Favor repaid. Nice and simple.
You got all that?

11:31.858 --> 11:34.736
-Yes, dear. Nice and simple.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.489
[maniacal laughter]

11:37.530 --> 11:38.198
[muffled laughing]

11:38.239 --> 11:40.950
-Why are you laughing?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.911
-It's certainly not because
I made this simple plan

11:42.952 --> 11:43.787
unnecessarily complicated.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.039
-[laughing]
-Phil!

11:46.081 --> 11:47.040
PHIL: <i>Sorry!</i>

11:49.376 --> 11:51.252
-No, I'm not! [gasps]
-GRUG: Pie?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.755
Where are you, pie?
[sniffing] I can smell ya.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.633
-Phil! He's coming. Get ready.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.551
-[panting]
-GRUG: Pie?

11:58.593 --> 12:01.971
Out here instead of in
the kitchen where pie belongs?

12:02.013 --> 12:04.599
-Works for me.
-Now, Phil.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.725
[rumbling, crashing]

12:05.767 --> 12:08.311
-Yes... Yes... Yes!

-Uh, maybe!

12:27.080 --> 12:31.167
-Sold!

-[gasps] Grug,
did you just save my life again?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.764
-Huh. I guess I did.
-No...

Rock, leaf, sharp rock, rock!

12:54.190 --> 12:56.985
-Leaf. Sorry, Dad. I win again.
-[Grug grumbles]

12:57.027 --> 12:58.028
Maybe choose something
besides rock?

12:58.069 --> 13:01.114
-No way! Rock never
lets you down.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.867
-Even though I lose
every single time.
-Solid logic.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.993
So, you were out
gathering berries

13:05.035 --> 13:06.369
and the pie was just
sitting there?

13:06.411 --> 13:09.622
-Yup! It's a whole new
pie species. Outside pie!

13:09.664 --> 13:11.041
-I can't believe you saved
Hope's life again.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.960
-He saved your life
twice? Wow, Mom!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.003
You are in deep to Grug.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.547
-Yes, Dawn. I'm well
aware of that,

13:17.589 --> 13:18.882
-but thank you for reminding me.
-GRUG: Hey, Thunk!

13:18.923 --> 13:21.926
I found some new berries.
Time for a new record!

13:21.968 --> 13:25.722
-Bring the berry, Dad.

It's poisonous.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.935
-Oh. Thanks, Hope. Thunk.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.021
-Nothin' but berry!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.732
-Ah...
-Grug! That one's
poisonous, too!

-Huh?

13:57.504 --> 14:01.091
-I'm free!

14:01.132 --> 14:02.050
-I guess that's an even-ing.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.511
-Too bad it's not evening.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.930
-Because then it'd be
an evening even-ing.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.390
-But it's not in the even-ing.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.142
Because I saved Grug's life
multiple times.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.770
Three poison berries,
three saves.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.439
So, <i>you</i>owe <i>me!</i>

14:22.237 --> 14:24.197
-What? I don't owe
Hope anything!

14:24.239 --> 14:25.240
-I'm afraid you do, Grug.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.325
You can no more escape
the even-ing

14:27.367 --> 14:29.202
than you can escape the evening.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.330
Hm... Maybe I <i>do</i>need
to rethink the name.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.582
-What? No! The name's
the best part.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.377
-B-b-but that's not
the Crood way. Right, Ugga?

14:37.419 --> 14:40.380
-No, but it's Hope's way,
and she did save your life.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.048
-[scoffs] Fine. I'll just do
some nice things for her,

14:42.090 --> 14:43.967
and we'll be even.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.301
Think she likes mini-caves?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.637
-I think it's gonna take
more than mini-caves.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.763
HOPE: Oh, Grug!

14:48.805 --> 14:50.890
Could you give me a hand
with something?

15:22.881 --> 15:24.007

17:14.325 --> 17:15.410
-DAWN: Yes!
-BOTH: Ah!

17:15.452 --> 17:17.162
-Whatever is, I'm in!

17:17.203 --> 17:18.371
-GRAN: Right!
-ALL: Ah!

17:18.413 --> 17:20.665
And I'll get rid of the bodies!

17:20.707 --> 17:23.501
Wait. How many bodies
are we talking?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.212
* *

17:26.254 --> 17:29.549
[groan, yawns]

17:29.591 --> 17:31.593
-Oh... Where are my sandals?

17:31.634 --> 17:33.470
-Ah!
-Hope, I've been thinking.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.263
I-I really haven't done enough

17:35.305 --> 17:37.390
to pay you back
for saving my life.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.267
-Right. You haven't.
Not even close.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.519
-Uh-huh. So, I asked myself,

17:41.561 --> 17:44.189
what can I do for
Hope to show her

17:44.230 --> 17:45.857
just how much I appreciate it?

17:45.899 --> 17:48.568
And then, I remembered
how much you love tartichokes.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.237
-What's not to love?
Whatever you say, you're wrong.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.822
They're the perfect mix
of sour and sweet.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.825
-That's why I'm gonna take you
to a tartichoke patch I found.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.495
Biggest tartichokes
you've ever seen.
Big as a boulder!

17:58.536 --> 17:59.579
-Impossible for two reasons.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.790
One, tartichokes don't
grow that big.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.459
And two, I know where all
the best tartichoke patches are.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.253
-But you don't know about
this one 'cause it's a secret.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.631
-Secret tartichoke patch?
I'm intrigued.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.384
Okay! I accept your
sweet invitation.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.344
-Sweet <i>and</i>tart. Here we go!

18:14.386 --> 18:16.805
-Now?
-GRUG: Yes, now!

18:16.846 --> 18:17.972
[panting]

18:18.014 --> 18:19.724
[groans]

18:19.766 --> 18:22.143
-And when we get back,
I want you to mow the farm.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.645
-Which part?
-The whole farm.

18:23.687 --> 18:25.563
It's getting a little shaggy,
don't you think?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.232
-[sighs] Yes, Hope.
-Am I detecting an attitude?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.942
-No, Hope.
-Good.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.527
Because I'd hate to think
you weren't grateful

18:30.568 --> 18:32.404
to be alive,
thanks to me.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.988
-I am, Hope.
-Great.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.950
And when you're done with that,
you can dust the treehouse.

18:36.991 --> 18:37.826
Inside <i>and</i>out.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.536
-You want me to dust outside?

18:39.577 --> 18:42.288
-If the dust wasn't <i>outside,</i>
it wouldn't get <i>inside!</i>

18:42.330 --> 18:43.998
-[sighs] You want it,
you got it, Hope.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.335
-Stop being so agreeable!
And how far away is this patch?

18:47.377 --> 18:49.295
Are you sure this bridge
is safe, Grug?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.463
It feels unstable.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.882
-Oh, it's the safest!
-[creaking]

18:52.924 --> 18:56.261
And it's the only way to get
to the secret tartichokes.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.304
Trust me, this artichoke juice

18:58.346 --> 19:00.306
-is worth the squeeze.
-You know, Grug,

19:00.348 --> 19:01.933
you really didn't
have to do this.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.477
I mean, I didn't ask you
to find me tartichokes.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.813
-I know, but you're the reason
I'm still here,

19:06.855 --> 19:08.773
and why Ugga still
has a husband,

19:08.815 --> 19:10.608
and why my kids still
have a dad.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.236
So this is the least I can do.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.156
-Yes, I suppose so.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.241
[bridge creaking]

19:18.283 --> 19:20.368
-Time to even things up.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.207
Now all I need is a sharp rock.
Rock, leaf, sharp rock,

19:26.249 --> 19:27.459
rock. No. Rock,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.502
leaf, sharp rock, rock.

19:29.544 --> 19:32.339
[growls] Why do
I always pick rock?

19:32.380 --> 19:33.465
C'mon, Grug, you can do this.

19:33.506 --> 19:37.010
Rock, leaf, sharp
rock, sharp rock!

19:37.052 --> 19:38.428
Yes! I did it!

19:38.470 --> 19:39.512
-[creaking]
-Oh, Hope,

19:39.554 --> 19:42.349
I'm gonna save your
life so hard...

19:42.390 --> 19:43.558
-HOPE: Hey, Grug?
-Nothing!

19:43.600 --> 19:45.185
-Just wanted to tell you

19:45.226 --> 19:47.145
I really appreciate this.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.814
-Well, uh, what can I say?
I know you like tartichokes.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.067
-I'm not talking about
the tartichokes.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.820
I'm talking about you.
All I've ever wanted

19:55.862 --> 19:58.615
was for people to appreciate
the things I do for them.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.451
But you're the first person
to do something nice for me

20:01.493 --> 20:03.286
that I didn't ask for.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.080
[snapping]

20:05.121 --> 20:06.373
So, thank you, Grug.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.541
-Oh, uh... Well,
you're welcome.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.378
-Phil may be a genius,
but you're a rock.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.381
Our rock. You keep
all of us safe,

20:14.422 --> 20:16.675
and you never let us down.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.552
-Right! That's why
I always pick rock!

20:19.594 --> 20:20.303
Because I <i>am</i>one!

20:20.345 --> 20:22.847
-Yes, you are.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.391
And I'm gonna do something
nice for you right now

20:24.432 --> 20:26.893
to thank you for all you do.

20:26.935 --> 20:30.146
-I'm calling us even.
-R-really?

20:30.188 --> 20:31.231
-Sure.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.440
Sorry I made you do
all that work.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.401
I hope you can forgive
me someday.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.779
-[snap]
-Uh, let's make it today.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.073
You're forgiven. We
should go. Now.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.408
-Thank you, Grug.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.576
Maybe people are
inherently good.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.869
-Yep! Good! Let's go.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.330
-I mean, here I was,
judging you...

20:47.372 --> 20:50.083
[both screaming]

20:50.125 --> 20:51.251
-Hold on!

20:51.292 --> 20:52.836
[both yelling]

20:52.877 --> 20:55.755
-You said this bridge was safe!
Is this your idea of safe?!

20:55.797 --> 20:57.590
-Well, yelling at
Grug doesn't help!

20:57.632 --> 20:59.509
So let's swing our
way to safety!

20:59.551 --> 21:01.094
Like punch monkeys! Come on!

21:01.136 --> 21:04.180
[both grunting]

21:04.222 --> 21:05.557
[stretching]

21:05.598 --> 21:07.934

-[both scream]

21:07.976 --> 21:09.227
HOPE:
Ah!

21:09.269 --> 21:10.603
This is your fault, Grug!

21:10.645 --> 21:13.440
-Again, yelling at Grug
solves nothing!

21:13.481 --> 21:15.442
So let's shimmy like
shrimpmunks!

21:15.483 --> 21:18.945
[both grunting]

21:18.987 --> 21:19.946
[gasps]

21:19.988 --> 21:21.114

21:21.156 --> 21:23.324
[straining]

21:23.366 --> 21:25.744
-Ah! Got any more great ideas?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.412
-Uh, scream like screamfruit?

21:27.454 --> 21:29.789
[both scream]

21:29.831 --> 21:31.332
-[both grunt]
-[panting]

21:31.374 --> 21:34.627
[panting]

21:34.669 --> 21:36.504
Grab my hand. I can climb
and carry you to the top.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.631
[gasping]

21:38.673 --> 21:40.675
-Wait! Are you trying
to save my life?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.844
-Yes! Now, give me your hand
before the vine snaps!

21:42.886 --> 21:46.556
-No! If you save my life,
I'll owe you again!

21:47.432 --> 21:48.475
[both yell]

21:48.516 --> 21:50.018
-Ah!
-No, Hope.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.562
Forget all that!
You don't owe me anything!

21:52.604 --> 21:54.689
I told you, saving people
is what Croods do.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.984
-No way! I can save myself!

21:58.026 --> 21:58.693
[both yell]

21:58.735 --> 22:00.487
-[grunts] No, you can't!

22:00.528 --> 22:02.739
-Let... [grunts] go... [grunts]

22:02.781 --> 22:05.575
-[Grug grunting]
-of me!

22:07.077 --> 22:09.662
[both screaming]

22:09.704 --> 22:12.415
-[both grunt]
-Gotcha!

22:12.457 --> 22:14.292
-Gran! You saved us!

22:14.334 --> 22:15.752
-What? Aw!

22:15.794 --> 22:18.588
I thought you were someone
else. Oh, well.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.507
-You know the best part, Grug?

22:20.548 --> 22:21.841
-We don't have to
walk home now?

22:21.883 --> 22:25.011
-No! Now, neither of us
owes each other anything!

22:25.053 --> 22:28.056
-That's right! Because
<i>you</i>owe <i>me</i>!

22:28.098 --> 22:31.518
And you're all mine until
I say otherwise!

22:31.559 --> 22:32.602
[laughs] Oh, yeah!

22:32.644 --> 22:35.939
I'm gonna grind you
into bone dust!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.524
See you at sunrise,
and don't be late!

22:37.565 --> 22:40.735
[ominous music]

22:41.403 --> 22:44.572
