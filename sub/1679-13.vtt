00:01.148 --> 00:03.369
Some kids dream of
being astronauts.

00:03.379 --> 00:05.558
Some kids dream of
playing baseball.

00:05.568 --> 00:08.099
When I was a kid,
I had only one dream.

00:08.154 --> 00:09.688
To build a skyscraper.

00:09.838 --> 00:11.664
That's stupid.

00:13.131 --> 00:15.206
There were some
obstacles along the way.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.605
But eventually my
dream came true.

00:17.841 --> 00:20.226
I became an architect.

00:20.236 --> 00:21.604
Morning, everyone!

00:21.676 --> 00:26.480
So, I had an idea
for the atrium.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.905
Ready?

00:28.151 --> 00:29.966
Columns.

00:30.549 --> 00:32.330
That's stupid.

00:53.188 --> 00:56.080
I... I can't believe you
knocked over my model.

00:56.095 --> 01:00.143
Well, it's just...
it's not exactly new, is it-- columns?

01:00.156 --> 01:03.380
I mean, what's your next
groundbreaking idea-- ceilings?

01:03.588 --> 01:04.962
Floors?

01:04.977 --> 01:06.760
Windows?

01:06.807 --> 01:09.531
I know what you're thinking:
Who's this jerk?

01:09.546 --> 01:12.081
Well, this jerk was
Hammond Druthers,

01:12.098 --> 01:14.411
a legend in the
architecture community.

01:14.427 --> 01:16.271
Very big in the '80s.

01:16.906 --> 01:20.012
He was also far and away
the worst boss I ever had.

01:20.275 --> 01:23.540
Then I designed the Spokane
National Bank Building.

01:23.558 --> 01:26.011
And suddenly... I was his boss.

01:26.058 --> 01:28.513
- And he didn't like it.
- Stairs?

01:28.726 --> 01:31.813
And to be honest,
I wasn't sure I liked it either.

01:31.828 --> 01:34.802
See, before,
when I was just another employee,

01:34.818 --> 01:37.342
I was happy, carefree.

01:37.357 --> 01:40.183
The guy who hung out in the break
room making fun of the boss.

01:40.196 --> 01:41.253
Did you see what he
was wearing today?

01:41.285 --> 01:44.040
It was like his pants were
being held up by his nipples.

01:46.365 --> 01:49.681
Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers,
I get hay fever just looking at it.

01:52.087 --> 01:54.232
But suddenly I was
a different guy.

01:55.507 --> 01:56.841
Hey, guys.

01:57.336 --> 01:58.781
What's so funny?

01:58.887 --> 01:59.983
Nothing.

02:00.126 --> 02:02.961
Um... nice shirt.

02:03.387 --> 02:04.673
Thanks.

02:04.687 --> 02:06.382
The hours were insane.

02:06.397 --> 02:09.560
I was always working even
when I wasn't at work.

02:09.576 --> 02:12.960
Oh, Robin...
I just had a great idea.

02:12.976 --> 02:16.702
Oh, do whatever you want to
me just don't wake me up.

02:20.146 --> 02:22.340
Before, I used to be this guy.

02:22.356 --> 02:25.662
Dude, of course you should take the
day off for the Foo Fighters concert.

02:25.677 --> 02:26.912
Just say you're sick.

02:26.925 --> 02:28.040
But now...

02:28.088 --> 02:29.392
I was this guy.

02:29.408 --> 02:30.782
Sick, huh?

02:32.278 --> 02:34.101
Unbutton your shirt.

02:35.597 --> 02:38.642
Hmm... "Foo Fighters."

02:39.756 --> 02:41.603
Get back to work.

02:42.016 --> 02:45.001
But still,
the worst part was Druthers.

02:45.017 --> 02:47.223
- Well, I was thinking...
- Ceilings? Oops.

02:47.238 --> 02:51.973
Said that already. Then again,
you seem to like rehashing old ideas.

02:51.986 --> 02:54.670
I'm kidding, of course.

02:54.738 --> 02:56.633
Another hole in one, boss.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.203
Oh, wow,
he must be really good-looking.

03:00.217 --> 03:01.293
Why would you say that?

03:01.306 --> 03:04.262
Well, 'cause only good-looking people
can get away with saying things like that.

03:04.295 --> 03:05.713
I have found that to be true.

03:05.725 --> 03:07.681
It's a blessing
and a curse really.

03:08.237 --> 03:10.570
Ted, you can't let him
treat you like that.

03:10.588 --> 03:12.833
Yeah, you gotta ask yourself,
who's the boss?

03:12.845 --> 03:14.850
- Tony.
- Angela.   - Mona.

03:15.047 --> 03:16.112
Mona?

03:16.127 --> 03:18.632
Watch it more closely.
Rock your world.

03:19.167 --> 03:20.663
So, what are you gonna do?

03:20.676 --> 03:23.983
Well... it's awkward, I mean,
the guy used to be my boss.

03:23.997 --> 03:26.143
So, I went to talk to
the managing partner.

03:26.156 --> 03:27.500
Fire him.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.971
Well, sir, I was thinking he could
just be put on a different project.

03:30.987 --> 03:32.281
Fire him!

03:32.298 --> 03:35.962
He's an arrogant,
washed-up, pain in the ass.

03:35.977 --> 03:38.791
In fact,
fire everyone on that project.

03:38.808 --> 03:42.040
Druthers, Mosby,
the whole lot of them.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.441
Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear
Mosby's doing some great work.

03:45.455 --> 03:50.180
Fine, Mosby can stay.
But tell him he's on thin ice.

03:52.085 --> 03:53.553
Come here.

03:55.515 --> 03:58.073
I like you, Crosby.

03:59.608 --> 04:01.053
You mind if I charge my phone?

04:01.068 --> 04:02.373
Knock yourself out.

04:02.626 --> 04:05.971
Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers,
the key is timing.

04:05.986 --> 04:08.391
Remember when I had to
fire my makeup artist?

04:08.427 --> 04:12.323
Vicki, um...
I'm so sorry about this,

04:12.337 --> 04:15.522
but there's been some
budget cuts and, um,

04:15.535 --> 04:17.361
we have to let you go.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.582
I mean, after tonight.

04:19.605 --> 04:22.222
I still need my makeup
for the broadcast.

04:22.835 --> 04:24.192
So...

04:25.936 --> 04:29.872
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families of the victims.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.240
You know what? I'm gonna do it.

04:31.258 --> 04:33.202
I'm gonna fire 
Druthers tomorrow.

04:36.187 --> 04:38.981
- Oh, my God!
- What?

04:38.995 --> 04:41.243
- Do you know about this?
- No.

04:41.257 --> 04:42.332
What is that?

04:42.347 --> 04:44.922
Only the greatest thing ever.

04:44.935 --> 04:47.632
Wait, wait, wait--
that's not enough buildup.

04:47.937 --> 04:50.522
If they were to cure
cancer tomorrow,

04:50.535 --> 04:53.191
this would still be the greatest
thing to happen all week.

04:53.205 --> 04:57.520
Okay. Now you're ready
for naked Marshall.

04:58.148 --> 04:59.813
Oh, my God.

05:00.215 --> 05:02.442
This  is awesome times awesome.

05:02.457 --> 05:04.023
It's awesome squared.

05:04.035 --> 05:06.551
I know, right?
Behind the piano this whole time.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.932
Wait. If Marshall went to
all this trouble to hide it,

05:08.946 --> 05:11.013
he clearly doesn't
want us to find it.

05:11.026 --> 05:12.562
Oh, come on, Robin.

05:12.578 --> 05:16.412
No, I'm saying that he must be
really embarrassed by this.

05:16.565 --> 05:19.171
We are gonna have so much fun.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.092
I know!
We're gonna have so much fun!

05:21.108 --> 05:23.511
Oh, sorry I'm late;
lunch ran a little long.

05:23.525 --> 05:24.942
You wanted to see me, Mosby?

05:24.957 --> 05:27.370
Uh, yeah, like four hours ago.

05:27.767 --> 05:30.943
Well, excuse me,
for spending the last four hours

05:30.958 --> 05:33.540
drawing designs
for your building.

05:33.968 --> 05:36.163
This is a cocktail napkin.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.600
Covered in profanity.

05:39.796 --> 05:41.861
Look, Hammond, um,

05:41.877 --> 05:44.643
there's no easy way
to say this, so...

05:45.197 --> 05:48.400
why don't we just, um,
step into your office.

05:49.586 --> 05:53.800
# Happy birthday to you #

05:53.818 --> 05:57.683
- # Happy birthday to you #
- Oh, you had me. You so had me.

05:57.697 --> 06:01.870
# Happy birthday, dear Hammond #

06:01.885 --> 06:05.190
# Happy birthday to you #

06:05.207 --> 06:07.520
So, you didn't fire him?

06:07.885 --> 06:10.671
I can't fire a guy on his birthday.
Everyone would hate me.

06:10.685 --> 06:14.352
Besides, they put a party hat on me.
My authority was compromised.

06:15.465 --> 06:18.382
Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat.

06:18.796 --> 06:21.820
I know how much
you love stools.

06:22.196 --> 06:25.142
Thanks. Yeah,
stools are better for your posture.

06:25.346 --> 06:29.783
And, uh... I... got you a rose.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.890
Thank you. That's so sweet.

06:31.908 --> 06:34.830
You guys are being... so sweet.

06:34.848 --> 06:38.170
Hey, guys. Guess what I got.
A new dart.

06:38.187 --> 06:39.910
Oh, wow, a new dart.

06:39.927 --> 06:41.690
Hey, that new dart is great.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.012
I did not know you were such
a fan of new dart, Barney.

06:44.027 --> 06:46.733
Oh, yes, Robin,
I just love new dart.

06:46.747 --> 06:48.560
Nude art.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.530
- Nude art.
- Nude art.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.795
Okay, all right, so what,
you guys found the painting, huh?

06:54.201 --> 06:56.216
I knew this day would come.

06:56.229 --> 06:57.450
How did you know that?

06:57.469 --> 06:59.453
Because I didn't
hide it very well.

06:59.845 --> 07:02.321
So the story on the painting is that,
back in college,

07:02.336 --> 07:05.243
Lily wanted to do a nude
study for her art class.

07:05.255 --> 07:07.121
Marshall wasn't
so into the idea.

07:07.138 --> 07:09.172
Well, I just...
don't think that some dude

07:09.188 --> 07:11.853
should drop trou just
to pose for you.

07:11.866 --> 07:16.271
It's for class, and it's just that
weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall.

07:16.287 --> 07:18.062
The frisbee dude
with the soul patch?

07:18.075 --> 07:19.753
He's like the hottest
guy in school!

07:19.765 --> 07:21.101
No, he's actually
a little husky...

07:21.138 --> 07:22.743
Oh, he's just huggable!

07:22.756 --> 07:24.350
And complicated...

07:24.365 --> 07:26.220
and a little bit of a jerk.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.901
Just enough so you think
maybe you can change him.

07:28.917 --> 07:31.031
Okay, just forget it.

07:33.566 --> 07:35.103
Call me old-fashioned,

07:35.117 --> 07:38.890
I just think that I'm the only
guy you should see naked.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.541
Well, then you'll
have to do it.

07:41.558 --> 07:44.803
Are you kidding me?
What if somebody sees it?

07:44.826 --> 07:47.162
We're not in high
school anymore.

07:47.177 --> 07:50.842
People don't make fun of you
for posing nude for a painting.

07:50.857 --> 07:52.612
We're adults now.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.631
We totally saw your butt.

07:58.685 --> 08:00.803
This painting has caused
too much grief already.

08:00.817 --> 08:02.512
I'm destroying it right now.

08:03.365 --> 08:05.600
Oh, no,
what's the matter, Marshall?

08:05.618 --> 08:06.732
Where is it?

08:06.916 --> 08:10.193
I'll tell you where it is if
you'll answer these riddles three.

08:10.207 --> 08:11.972
You hung it up in the bar,
didn't you?

08:11.985 --> 08:13.702
Yo, why you gotta
ruin my riddles?

08:15.375 --> 08:16.803
Field trip!

08:20.746 --> 08:24.622
Oh, no. Someone put your
painting up behind the bar.

08:24.636 --> 08:25.803
Classic!

08:25.816 --> 08:27.762
What a memorable prank.

08:29.418 --> 08:31.370
Hey, Marshall.
What'll you have?

08:31.387 --> 08:34.361
What'll I have?
Um, I don't know, maybe a beer

08:34.375 --> 08:37.409
and that nude painting of
me hanging behind the bar!

08:37.426 --> 08:39.311
Ooh,  I'm sorry,
that painting's property of the bar.

08:39.346 --> 08:40.772
I know that Barney gave
you that painting.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.113
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.573
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.573
I doubt it.

08:44.587 --> 08:46.421
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll give you that plus ten bucks.

08:46.456 --> 08:47.340
I doubt it.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.971
All right, you know what, Carl, you
just lost yourself a regular customer.

08:50.008 --> 08:51.531
I doubt it.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.962
This painting is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.322
Okay, where should we put it up next?
In his law school?

09:03.336 --> 09:04.993
Ooh on the side of a bus.
Oh, oh!

09:05.006 --> 09:06.542
How much do billboards cost?

09:06.555 --> 09:09.070
Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.431
I've got a five-year
rollout plan.

09:11.446 --> 09:14.042
I'll have you know that painting's
got commitments all over the city.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.682
Then, after New York...

09:23.275 --> 09:25.222
One of my worst
fears has come true--

09:25.235 --> 09:27.463
I just saw Marshall
grabbing himself naked.

09:28.386 --> 09:29.841
Well, I gotta go.

09:29.855 --> 09:31.833
Believe it or not,
I have to go back to the office.

09:31.868 --> 09:33.292
Oh, I'll go out with you.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.402
Bye, guys.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.872
You know, I wish everyone didn't 
have to make fun of that painting.

09:38.885 --> 09:41.431
Eh, we're not making fun of the painting,
we're just making fun of Marshall.

09:41.467 --> 09:43.573
The painting's
actually really great.

09:43.587 --> 09:45.782
-  Are you serious?
- Yeah.

09:46.096 --> 09:47.742
Well, thank you.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.151
You know, seeing it again
makes me miss painting nudes.

09:53.906 --> 09:55.150
What?

09:55.385 --> 09:57.050
Paint me.

09:57.756 --> 09:58.940
What?

10:00.425 --> 10:01.851
Paint  me.

10:07.688 --> 10:08.962
Who's that?

10:09.167 --> 10:10.581
Who's out there?

10:10.837 --> 10:12.563
Hammond, is that you?

10:12.606 --> 10:13.902
Mosby?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.382
Druthers and I were
alone in the office.

10:17.396 --> 10:18.740
If I was gonna fire him,

10:18.757 --> 10:20.740
this would be the best
chance I'd ever have.

10:20.757 --> 10:22.650
Uh, look, just a second, Ted.

10:22.668 --> 10:24.761
Uh, no, I,
I really need to talk to you.

10:24.777 --> 10:26.851
Look, there's no
easy way to say...

10:26.867 --> 10:28.322
What, what are you doing?

10:29.117 --> 10:30.660
What are you doing?

10:30.677 --> 10:33.500
I'm standing here
wearing pants.

10:34.236 --> 10:36.761
Are you sleeping here?
What's going on?

10:36.776 --> 10:38.430
Okay, fine, yes.

10:38.445 --> 10:39.773
Not that it's any
of your business

10:39.807 --> 10:42.611
but my wife had a little
spat a few weeks ago,

10:42.627 --> 10:45.563
and I've been sleeping
here until she cools off.

10:45.576 --> 10:48.412
Okay, well, uh, you're right--
that is none of my business.

10:48.428 --> 10:50.653
Uh, look,
there's no easy way to say this-- I...

10:50.667 --> 10:52.042
Who am I kidding?

10:52.257 --> 10:55.202
She's never gonna take me back.

11:00.936 --> 11:02.313
It's okay.

11:08.097 --> 11:10.120
What did you want to say to me?

11:12.718 --> 11:14.422
Happy birthday, buddy.

11:24.638 --> 11:27.113
So, you've been
living at the office?

11:27.245 --> 11:28.540
Yes.

11:28.835 --> 11:31.670
I'm an architect
without a home.

11:31.985 --> 11:34.290
You see the tragic
irony in that?

11:34.307 --> 11:35.991
- Yeah, I do.
- 'Cause I design homes.

11:36.008 --> 11:37.243
- I see it.
- But I don't have a home.

11:37.276 --> 11:38.632
Not lost on me at all.

11:39.687 --> 11:42.282
But I don't understand--
why don't you just go to a hotel?

11:42.297 --> 11:44.773
You could be sleeping on
a mattress instead of...

11:44.788 --> 11:48.013
what appears to be torn-up
drawings of my building.

11:48.026 --> 11:50.110
Why would I go to a hotel,
when any second,

11:50.125 --> 11:52.562
she's going to call and
tell me to come home.

11:54.317 --> 11:56.813
She's a very special lady, Ted.

11:56.907 --> 12:01.150
She's quite... mannish.

12:01.248 --> 12:03.652
She gives me what I need.

12:03.735 --> 12:05.431
Do you understand that?

12:05.887 --> 12:08.221
Uh, no, I don't.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.870
If you were lost
in the wilderness,

12:11.078 --> 12:13.252
she can provide for me.

12:14.386 --> 12:16.332
Well, that's the dream.

12:17.997 --> 12:20.283
I'm glad you came
here tonight, Ted.

12:20.298 --> 12:21.272
Me too, Hammond.

12:21.288 --> 12:22.331
- Call me Ham.
- No, thanks.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.853
- Hammy D?
- No, I think just Hammond.

12:24.966 --> 12:28.450
So, I'm guessing
you didn't fire him.

12:30.728 --> 12:33.071
I was this close.

12:33.808 --> 12:36.120
Meanwhile, Lily had
been up all night

12:36.136 --> 12:38.143
in the grips of a dilemma.

12:48.207 --> 12:50.720
- Oh honey, you're awake?
- I'm awake.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.682
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

12:53.696 --> 12:56.612
I've kind of been
wrestling with something.

12:56.627 --> 12:59.802
What if I told you I had a
way to pay for our honeymoon?

12:59.815 --> 13:01.652
Baby, our honeymoon's
already paid for.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.503
We're going to Howe Caverns.

13:03.565 --> 13:08.770
Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't
want to spend our honeymoon in a cave?

13:09.138 --> 13:12.471
It's not just a cave,
it's a whole labyrinth of caves.

13:12.488 --> 13:14.391
It's an underground adventure.

13:14.405 --> 13:17.522
There's a cave that's so dark that
you don't even know you're in there.

13:17.536 --> 13:20.550
I mean, we're going to experience
a whole new kind of dark.

13:20.625 --> 13:24.642
Well, what if I found a way
to make a little extra money

13:24.657 --> 13:27.783
so that we spend our
honeymoon not in Howe Caverns,

13:27.798 --> 13:30.223
but in Scotland?

13:30.237 --> 13:32.291
- Loch Ness?
- Yeah.

13:32.307 --> 13:35.331
And you know, Edinburgh and
the Highlands and Glasgow...

13:35.345 --> 13:38.230
Loch Ness. Nessy.

13:38.438 --> 13:42.771
Baby, I would love to search for the
enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch,

13:42.785 --> 13:45.722
but... we can't afford that.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.672
Maybe we can.

13:47.707 --> 13:50.893
Paint me.

13:51.237 --> 13:53.091
Okay, I don't get this.

13:53.106 --> 13:55.140
You've been making fun of
that painting all this time

13:55.175 --> 13:56.782
and now you want
me to paint you?

13:56.796 --> 13:59.451
We knew we could torture
Marshall because he has shame.

13:59.466 --> 14:00.622
I do not.

14:00.637 --> 14:03.390
In my body,
where the shame gland should be,

14:03.406 --> 14:05.813
there's a second awesome gland.

14:05.826 --> 14:07.172
True story.

14:07.336 --> 14:10.163
Yeah, that's not the gland
I'm worried about painting.

14:10.777 --> 14:11.792
Yeah.

14:11.836 --> 14:14.551
A nude Barney is a challenge.

14:14.726 --> 14:18.860
But I think you're talented
enough to immortalize this.

14:19.566 --> 14:21.710
Now is the time-- I'm 31.

14:21.725 --> 14:24.601
I'm at the peak of
my physical beauty.

14:24.617 --> 14:28.862
If I were a woman,
I'd have passed it long, long ago.

14:29.288 --> 14:31.120
Long ago.

14:31.257 --> 14:32.493
Forget it.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.990
I promised Marshall he was the
only guy I would ever see naked.

14:38.207 --> 14:40.872
I'll give you $5,000.

14:40.887 --> 14:42.412
We're going to Loch Ness!

14:42.427 --> 14:43.581
Yeah!

14:46.127 --> 14:48.333
That cabby would not shut up.

14:48.345 --> 14:50.311
Yeah, we should
call him a gabby.

14:50.328 --> 14:52.651
I think it, you say it.

14:53.058 --> 14:57.002
Hey, uh... thanks for putting
me up last night, buddy.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.673
Give 'em hell.

15:00.938 --> 15:02.302
Morning, team.

15:02.317 --> 15:05.032
So, I have given
it some thought,

15:05.048 --> 15:09.142
and I say we revisit columns.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.793
Oh, God, not this again.

15:11.948 --> 15:15.510
Ted, a man in a toga just arrived
and delivered a parchment.

15:15.528 --> 15:16.950
Let me read it:

15:17.645 --> 15:19.253
Oh! It's from ancient Greece.

15:19.268 --> 15:22.591
They want their basic
architectural elements back.

15:22.605 --> 15:24.633
- Geez.
- What?

15:24.655 --> 15:25.970
You didn't hear me?

15:25.988 --> 15:27.832
Toga, parchment...

15:28.048 --> 15:29.903
Can I see you for one second?

15:29.917 --> 15:32.592
Ooh, I'm in trouble now.

15:35.666 --> 15:37.031
What are you doing?

15:37.045 --> 15:38.590
I thought we were friends.

15:38.607 --> 15:40.680
You slept on my couch,
you ate my cereal.

15:40.696 --> 15:43.070
I tossed you more toilet paper.

15:43.086 --> 15:44.352
We are friends.

15:44.366 --> 15:48.412
But that doesn't magically
make your bad ideas good.

15:48.426 --> 15:50.211
What? I don't believe this!

15:50.225 --> 15:52.323
You're, you're,
you're wearing my clothes!

15:52.335 --> 15:54.373
And my
girlfriend's... sneakers--

15:54.385 --> 15:56.583
man, you have
weirdly small feet.

15:56.637 --> 16:00.423
Ted, I hope that you're not going
to let our professional woes

16:00.437 --> 16:02.401
interfere with our friendship,

16:02.418 --> 16:05.722
because I really kind
of need you right now.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.152
Okay, let's get this over with.

16:10.167 --> 16:13.100
Hey, hey!
I don't want you phoning this in.

16:13.115 --> 16:16.133
This painting could, someday,
become a serious work of art.

16:16.145 --> 16:18.793
I mean, you have been
blessed with an amazing gift.

16:18.806 --> 16:20.200
Thank you.

16:20.215 --> 16:21.782
I meant me.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.673
Now, I like how you captured
Marshall's essence.

16:25.686 --> 16:28.011
Goofy and unburdened, with wit.

16:28.026 --> 16:30.712
But me,
I want something more regal.

16:30.725 --> 16:32.891
Something my progeny
could look at and say,

16:32.905 --> 16:35.653
"There's stands
Barnabus Stinson."

16:35.667 --> 16:37.373
He was wise...

16:37.728 --> 16:39.560
and strong.

16:41.317 --> 16:43.943
I don't think your
sword will fit.

16:43.955 --> 16:45.642
I get that a lot.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.950
And so, as Lily began painting,

16:48.966 --> 16:50.883
Marshall thought
about the $5,000

16:50.896 --> 16:53.380
and what his fiancée
was doing to earn it.

16:53.395 --> 16:55.090
This isn't right.

16:56.008 --> 16:58.043
This isn't right at all.

16:58.056 --> 17:00.560
Finally, he could
take it no more.

17:03.908 --> 17:05.080
Hold still.

17:06.848 --> 17:08.441
Hold still.

17:10.718 --> 17:13.680
- Hold still!
- Paint faster!

17:15.516 --> 17:18.643
Okay, I guess it's time.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.113
Drop your shorts.

17:21.405 --> 17:22.871
Yeah.

17:23.837 --> 17:25.119
Wait, wait!

17:25.137 --> 17:27.782
That wasn't enough buildup.
I need...

17:28.176 --> 17:31.012
In a world without justice,
one man--

17:31.026 --> 17:33.191
- Oh, just drop them!
- All right.

17:35.768 --> 17:38.770
- No! No, this is not right!
- We had a deal!

17:38.788 --> 17:40.700
Well, I'm going back on the deal.
Barney, get out!

17:40.735 --> 17:42.452
- You...!
- It's over!

17:45.548 --> 17:48.630
Lily, I can't let you
go through with this!

17:48.645 --> 17:52.093
I found a castle we can stay in,
but it's an extra two grand.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.901
It's just not right!

17:53.916 --> 17:56.570
It's beautiful and
they say it's haunted.

17:56.587 --> 18:00.290
I can't let the woman I love
compromise her values for money!

18:00.306 --> 18:03.260
I totally think we can get 
some more money out of him.

18:03.277 --> 18:05.950
I'm never letting my
fiancée, ever...!

18:05.968 --> 18:07.470
Oh, you're still here?

18:07.488 --> 18:08.693
Before you say anything,

18:08.708 --> 18:10.233
I'll give you an
extra five grand.

18:10.246 --> 18:11.520
We accept.

18:12.426 --> 18:15.410
You people are so
easy to control.

18:15.945 --> 18:18.680
Dance for me, puppets, dance.

18:18.697 --> 18:22.670
And  that's how Uncle Barney paid
for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon.

18:24.238 --> 18:26.271
Come on, Ted, listen,
why don't we get back

18:26.286 --> 18:28.022
and finish drawing the
plans for a building

18:28.036 --> 18:30.402
which, in my opinion,
is never going to get built,

18:30.418 --> 18:33.151
so you and I can get out of here
and grab a couple of beers.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.152
No.

18:34.165 --> 18:37.610
Look, Hammond,
there's no easy way to say this but...

18:37.625 --> 18:38.743
Looking for Hammond Druthers.

18:38.776 --> 18:40.592
Oh, that's me.
I'm Hammond Druthers.

18:42.485 --> 18:44.341
These are divorce papers.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.952
You've been served.

18:45.976 --> 18:47.590
Oh, God.

18:48.036 --> 18:50.483
She's really going
through with this.

18:50.528 --> 18:53.743
So that's it. It's over.

18:53.865 --> 18:56.110
There is no easy way
to say this, but...

18:56.126 --> 18:59.293
She's giving me the
remains of Wolfie?

18:59.875 --> 19:01.731
My dog is dead?

19:01.958 --> 19:04.453
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

19:04.607 --> 19:07.713
She always played
too rough with him.

19:08.598 --> 19:11.371
Believe me,
there is no easy way to say this--

19:11.386 --> 19:15.710
- # Happy birthday to you... #
- You've got to be kidding me!

19:15.726 --> 19:18.553
Guys, you have no idea how much
this means to me right now.

19:18.567 --> 19:20.120
Wait, his birthday
was yesterday!

19:20.138 --> 19:22.372
Yeah, but a bunch of us were up
at the conference in Montreal,

19:22.408 --> 19:25.603
- so we thought...
- No! No birthday! No!

19:25.616 --> 19:28.211
I got something to say
and I'm gonna get it out.

19:28.227 --> 19:31.242
Hammond, listen to me.
I am sorry that your dog died,

19:31.256 --> 19:33.773
and that your wife is
divorcing you and that...

19:33.785 --> 19:36.260
your life is falling apart and that
these guys missed your birthday.

19:36.295 --> 19:38.161
And there is no
easy way to say...

19:38.177 --> 19:39.932
What are you doing?
What's going on?

19:39.945 --> 19:41.433
Oh, God...

19:41.445 --> 19:44.262
Oh, come on, you're not going
to pull that, are you?

19:44.286 --> 19:49.293
Oh! Look, yeah, right.
Now we're falling onto the ground.

19:49.308 --> 19:52.372
Well, nice try, but guess what?

19:52.618 --> 19:54.181
You're fired!

19:54.196 --> 19:57.362
You're fired--
you get it? You hear me?

19:57.378 --> 20:00.133
You're gone! You're fired!

20:15.825 --> 20:19.423
In my defense,
I think we all suspected Hammond

20:19.437 --> 20:21.191
might have been faking.

20:22.626 --> 20:26.750
On the plus side, the EMTs seem to
think he's going to be just fine

20:26.767 --> 20:31.232
and, as you saw, they did admit that
I did not cause the heart attack,

20:31.248 --> 20:33.791
even if they said it
a bit begrudgingly.

20:34.735 --> 20:37.892
And there it was, rock bottom:

20:37.907 --> 20:39.700
They all hated me.

20:39.736 --> 20:41.781
But just when all seemed lost,

20:41.796 --> 20:45.030
I had the greatest idea
of my entire career.

20:48.537 --> 20:51.731
Margarita Fridays--
great idea, boss.

21:03.647 --> 21:05.673
Okay, it's done.

21:06.127 --> 21:09.032
I'm gonna step out,
so you can admire it.

21:09.047 --> 21:10.841
Thank you very much, Lily.

21:14.255 --> 21:15.852
Marshall, do you
have the money?

21:15.868 --> 21:17.921
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here!

21:17.965 --> 21:21.400
A smooth area?!
You gave me the Ken doll?!

21:25.225 --> 21:27.530
She left out Little Barney.

21:28.378 --> 21:30.503
Barnacle Junior.

21:31.086 --> 21:33.491
My Barnana is...

21:35.158 --> 21:37.323
Barnito Supreme.
