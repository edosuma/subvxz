WEBVTT

02:35.280 --> 02:37.532
They're now beginning
to pressurize the tanks.

02:37.616 --> 02:43.205
Pressurize all of the tanks in
all three stages with gaseous helium.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.540
As the pressurization builds up,
it's monitored.

02:45.624 --> 02:51.296
Here in the control center, our
status board still indicating all is well.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.007
Network, flight. You configured
for the terminal count?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.759
- Roger, flight. We're a go.
- Okay.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.178
Check status
for terminal count, rooster?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.554
- Go, flight.
- Retro?

02:59.638 --> 03:00.972
- We're a go.
- Fido?

03:01.056 --> 03:02.224
-Gmc?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.475
- Go, flight.
- E-com?

03:03.558 --> 03:04.702
- Affirmative, flight.
- F-com?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.144
Go all the way.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.773
Sony panel three, tape recorder
forward, switch to forward.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.567
- Verify gray bar.
- Roger, we have a gray flag.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.194
Dnc is running, flight.

03:14.277 --> 03:17.572
Roger, in automatic sequence,
start on my Mark.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.157
- Mark.
- All right, Jim.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.577
- Stand by your panel 325 function.
- Rogen

03:22.661 --> 03:24.579
- fuel pre-pressure initiated.
- Roger, fuel.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.416
- This one's gonna light on your toes.
- Pcs bypass on.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.918
- Glycol radiator full to bypass.
- Full to bypass.

03:30.001 --> 03:33.296
- Internal cooling, flight.
- This is launch control.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.424
The second stage fuel tank
is pressurized.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.719
The third stage liquid oxygen tank
pressurizing at this time.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.846
Ironman one, this is flight,
how do you read?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.556
- Loud and clear, dick.
- All right.

03:42.639 --> 03:46.143
Cmp on panel two,
verify program two.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.477
- We're a go, flight.
- Rogen

03:47.561 --> 03:50.147
- flight recorder to record.
- Gdc, align.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.941
- Gdc, align.
- All recorders to flight speed.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.610
- Network, flight. All okay with you?
- Affirmed, flight.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.904
Rtc, you got everybody configured
for commands?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.615
- That's affirmative.
- Internal power and go, flight.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.617
- You got the transfer?
- That's affirmed.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.120
Ironman one, stand by
for the 10-second count.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.164
Roger, Ted.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.834
Ten, nine, eight...

04:10.917 --> 04:15.756
Seven, six, five, four...

05:06.097 --> 05:09.142
- Flight, safety is green downrange.
- Roger, safety green.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.771
- Booster okay.
- Go, flight.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.404
- Everything okay?
- Affirmed.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.823
- Gnc?
- Go, flight.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.783
-Flight, we're. A go.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.076
Rogen

05:47.889 --> 05:49.808
Dx manual.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.895
- Stand by for mode one Charlie.
- Mode one Charlie.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.897
Mode one Charlie.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.154
Rooster, I need your
status for staging.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.741
- The tower has jettisoned.
- Trajectory and guidance are a go.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.827
Roger, trajectory and guidance a go.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.789
- Spacecraft systems are a go.
- Spacecraft systems are go.

06:28.847 --> 06:33.435
- All spacecraft systems are go.
- No mistaking.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.437
- We have ceco.
- Roger, ceco.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.822
Hey, it looks like a fine day
down there!

07:28.907 --> 07:32.911
I can see all the way
from Gibraltar to Greece.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.998
Coming up on the Terminator, should
be in our first sunset in a few minutes.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.677
- Loss of signal with canary.
- Roger, iOS.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.763
Okay time to activate TV transmission.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.307
We remote to Houston through
araya, buzz.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.018
Araya one, this is ironman, how do
you copy, over?

07:57.102 --> 08:00.105
Ironman one, araya. I read you
loud and clear, copy.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.065
I read you the same.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.443
On my Mark, TV transmission
from camera a.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.947
- Mark.
- Smile!

08:12.158 --> 08:17.122
- How are you getting this?
- A little snowy, ironman.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.919
Clearing up now.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.214
Clear now. Good picture.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.176
Well, say something, Ted.
Are we beautiful?

08:30.260 --> 08:35.515
Ironman, this is Houston.
See you real good, all three of you.

08:35.598 --> 08:39.644
- How about the other camera, Jim?
- Camera b coming on.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.986
You should be getting me now.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.281
Here's buzz.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.369
Here's stoney.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.999
- How's it look?
- Sharp and clear.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.917
How are you for docking
with the lab?

09:03.001 --> 09:07.464
Docking is still planned
for the second orbit as advertised.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.301
Roger. We have an update
on your initial phase maneuver.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.804
Delta v, 249 at .3 feet per second.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.473
This is mission control, Houston,

09:16.556 --> 09:19.517
at 22 minutes into the flight
of ironman one.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.395
After a brief 20-minute flight
across the Atlantic

09:22.479 --> 09:25.940
the spacecraft is now
crossing the mediterranean.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.777
We begin to look at the
business of the flight plan

09:28.860 --> 09:30.945
which shows
a rendezvous on docking

09:31.029 --> 09:32.864
with the saturn 4b
orbital laboratory.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.908
Buzz, what's our closing rate?

10:18.493 --> 10:21.830
- Closing rate: 50 feet per second.
- Rogen

10:21.913 --> 10:25.041
- let me know when we have 25.
- Rogen

11:03.496 --> 11:05.540
This is mission control, Houston.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.334
Commander pruett reported
completion of docking the Apollo

11:08.418 --> 11:10.295
at the 5-48 laboratory.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.048
After completing systems checks,
the crew will transfer into the lab

11:14.132 --> 11:17.093
in which they will live and work
for the next seven months.

11:17.177 --> 11:21.139
This will be a test of the spacecraft,
the systems and most of all the men.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.267
In preparation for interplanetary
deep-space missions

11:24.350 --> 11:26.603
which are now being planned.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.772
During this entire period the
astronauts will cover their activities

11:29.856 --> 11:33.067
with TV cameras, which will be
tape-recorded here on earth

11:33.151 --> 11:35.403
for study and evaluation.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.570
Well, it's not too bad. We could use
a couple of windows though.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.114
I think we're missing the view.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.283
What's first, buzz?

12:23.117 --> 12:26.287
Extra vehicular activities
in the s-509 maneuvering unit.

12:26.371 --> 12:30.291
You take it out.
Stoney, you handle the camera.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.592
Watch it, stoney.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.897
Try a little aerobatics here.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.483
Here goes.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.611
Buzz, how about some work?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.322
Yeah, right.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.826
I'm coming right down.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.372
Okay, buzz,
micrometeorite experiment.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.874
- Say again, stoney.
- Micrometeorite.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.585
Roger, micrometeorite.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.139
This material was obtained
during their first week in space.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.183
I am presenting it
as a point of reference.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.102
Here is pruett.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.272
Lloyd.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.607
Stone.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.403
We got this day before yesterday.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.243
It demonstrates a serious decline
in the ability to perform

15:52.326 --> 15:55.121
even simple manual tasks.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.417
Just over five months of the mission
have been completed satisfactorily.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.379
We wonder if it remains desirable to
continue for the full seven months

16:03.463 --> 16:05.423
originally planned.

16:11.679 --> 16:16.559
- What are your parameters, Courtney?
- EKG, rate and rhythm.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.896
- Eeg, brain.
- He's not sleeping.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.690
The trend shows definite fatigue.

16:23.441 --> 16:27.361
- Is he still losing weight?
- Down 16 pounds.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.448
The quality of the solar spectral film's
been very poor.

16:31.365 --> 16:35.119
- Well, you're not gonna see any more.
- Why not?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.872
Take a look at this.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.678
Tired and he's making mistakes.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.849
You want to try living in a tin can
for five months?

16:58.476 --> 17:01.729
- What else?
- We got this yesterday.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.777
Some further degradations
to our cs system:

17:07.860 --> 17:11.572
We've lost a backup coolant
loop in the oil thruster.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.579
Oh, yeah.
The washing machine is out.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.333
I was doing some preventative
maintenance on it. I shorted it out.

17:22.416 --> 17:26.546
I also discovered some computation
errors in the telescope settings.

17:26.629 --> 17:32.510
I guess that accounts for the poor
quality in the solar spectral pictures.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.646
I've fixed the razor.

17:47.525 --> 17:51.028
So we can go back to shaving
again now.

17:51.529 --> 17:56.367
And I'm sleeping better.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.580
I guess we're all getting
our second wind.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.877
And if the hardware holds up, I guess
we can make it right to the end.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.213
I know I can.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.216
I think they've done a hell of a job.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.555
Bring them down.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.724
Yes, sir.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.562
Mrs. Wheeler, get everyone on the net
in mission control.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.921
This is mission control, Houston.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.759
The crew of ironman one has closed
down the 5-48 space laboratory

18:54.842 --> 19:00.181
in which they've worked, lived, slept
and eaten for the last five months.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.933
Their Apollo spacecraft
has separated from the lab

19:03.017 --> 19:07.146
and at this time, the automatic
sequence of retrofire is about to begin.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.690
Ten, nine, eight...

19:09.774 --> 19:13.527
Seven, six, five, four...

19:13.611 --> 19:18.449
Three, two, one, retrofire.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.577
The spacecraft should be
starting its descent across Australia

19:21.661 --> 19:24.455
towards the splash point
in the pacific

19:24.538 --> 19:26.832
some 400 miles
south of midway island.

19:26.916 --> 19:30.711
They are waiting now for confirmation
of retrofire. Standing by for contact.

19:31.545 --> 19:36.634
Ironman one, ironman one, this is
Houston Capcom, do you read?

19:38.928 --> 19:45.017
Ironman one, ironman one, this is
Houston Capcom, do you read?

19:45.101 --> 19:47.561
After five months in orbit,
a mission termed

19:47.645 --> 19:50.731
a successful prelude
to the long-term space voyages

19:50.815 --> 19:53.150
that some day will be normal
and routine,

19:53.234 --> 19:56.153
astronauts Jim pruett, buzz Lloyd
and Clayton stone

19:56.237 --> 19:58.781
should be on their fiery way home
to the good earth.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.827
Ironman one, ironman one, this is
Houston Capcom, do you read?

20:04.495 --> 20:09.083
Ironman one, ironman one, this
is Houston Capcom, do you read?

20:09.917 --> 20:13.421
Ironman one, ironman one,
this is Houston Capcom on uhf.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.756
Do you read?

20:15.840 --> 20:19.593
Ironman one, ironman one,
this is Houston Capcom on uhf.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.679
Do you read?

20:23.013 --> 20:26.600
Ironman one, ironman one, this
is Houston Capcom on s-band.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.145
- Do you read?
- Go ahead, Houston.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.605
Hey, you old bum. How's the run?

20:31.689 --> 20:33.691
We have negative retrofire.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.695
Say again, ironman.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.740
Negative, no burn.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.325
Bailey, kill it.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.995
- Ironman, wait one.
- What's wrong, dick?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.872
Don't know.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.792
E-com, gnc,
how does the data look?

20:51.876 --> 20:53.794
A minute and 20 seconds
past retrofire.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.339
Ironman, flight. Would you check
your circuit breakers

20:57.423 --> 21:00.634
and also your delta v thrust
manual a and b switches?

21:00.718 --> 21:02.386
Rogen

21:02.470 --> 21:05.306
Glenn, would you punch up
channel six?

21:06.724 --> 21:10.644
- All parameters are normal.
- Then why in the hell doesn't it fire?

21:10.728 --> 21:13.647
- Houston, ironman.
- Go, ironman.

21:13.731 --> 21:17.359
Circuit breakers are closed,
sps switch is on.

21:17.443 --> 21:21.447
Delta v manual a and b switches
are on.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.616
Thank you.
We're affirming new target.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.619
Suggest you try manual re-entry
on your next pass.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.664
Roger, understand manual re-entry
using rcs backup system.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.501
Negative, Jim. Negative.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.753
We suggest you use
the primary system.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.676
- We just told them it didn't work.
- Houston...

21:42.760 --> 21:44.762
We prefer using
the backup thrusters.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.185
I'm afraid you don't have
backup thrusters.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.398
- Say again?
- You've fallen too low in rcs fuel.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.693
What about the lab?
There's oxygen in the lab.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.696
Houston, do we have enough fuel
to re-dock with the lab?

22:04.031 --> 22:06.200
Negative, ironman. Negative.

22:07.576 --> 22:11.914
- Well, what do you propose, Ted?
- You have insufficient rcs fuel.

22:11.997 --> 22:17.920
You're going to have to try retrofire
with your primary engine.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.714
Smart boys think your automatic
control system is out

22:20.798 --> 22:22.716
but you'll be able to get ignition

22:22.800 --> 22:26.470
from your primary engine
on manual command.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.765
In other words, kick the box, Jimmy.

22:29.849 --> 22:34.478
- Do you copy, ironman?
- Yeah, copy.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.732
- Mr. Keith, bao.
- No announcement.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.735
We should say something, sir.
We've been off the air...

22:41.819 --> 22:44.738
All right. Just keep it trivial.
Keep it routine.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.032
- We may not have a problem.
- Yes, sir.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.286
This is mission control, Houston.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.414
We received word from ironman
one of a malfunctioning switch

22:53.497 --> 22:55.833
that has prevented retrofire
on their last orbit.

22:56.834 --> 23:02.131
They'll bypass the switch. At their
next orbit we'll try manual retrofire.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.552
This is canon in Houston.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.762
- Yeah, canon?
- Unfreeze the dead, will you?

23:08.846 --> 23:11.056
- Hold on a second.
- Are you ready now?

23:11.140 --> 23:12.766
- Go ahead.
- Primary engine

23:12.850 --> 23:14.685
did not fire on first pass.

23:14.768 --> 23:18.147
The secondary thrusters are out.
Repeat, out.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.775
If that big baby doesn't fire this time,
they're not coming back.

23:21.859 --> 23:25.613
Motor, pitch two and yaw two
start, on.

23:25.696 --> 23:27.489
Pitch two and yaw two start, on.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.783
- One minute to burn.
- One minute to burn.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.869
Translation hand controller, neutral.

23:32.912 --> 23:37.750
- Hand controller neutral.
- Hand controller power, both.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.961
- On.
- Direct rcs, on.

23:41.045 --> 23:44.798
- Direct rcs.
- Delta v thrust, a and b normal.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.801
- A and b normal.
- Thirty seconds to burn.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.970
- Thirty seconds.
- Hand controller's armed.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.475
- Hand controller armed.
- Hand controller's armed.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.894
Ems delta v, auto.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.815
- Delta v, auto.
- Fifteen seconds to burn.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.109
- Roger, 15 seconds.
- Acknowledge.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.655
All right, you bastard,
fire, fire, fire!

24:07.738 --> 24:11.241
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

24:11.325 --> 24:17.831
Five, four, three, two, one, retrofire.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.503
Direct delta v switch.

24:29.051 --> 24:32.304
Ironman, this is Houston. Ironman,
this is Houston, do you read?

24:32.388 --> 24:36.016
- Go, Houston.
- Do you affirm retrofire?

24:36.100 --> 24:38.227
- Negafive.
- Say again.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.771
I said, we had negative retrofire.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.859
Ironman, this is Keith, do you get any
indications from your event lights?

24:45.943 --> 24:48.946
Boss, we got a little light here
that says we have retrofired.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.242
It's green. We're gonna decorate it
for Christmas.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.370
All right, ironman,
we're going to work on it.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.080
Rogen

24:58.872 --> 25:00.916
cabin pressurization on.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.420
We'll be back in a couple of hours.
Get out of your hot suits.

25:04.503 --> 25:08.298
-Rogen -see you later.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.217
We'll be here.

25:22.396 --> 25:26.984
I want a complete tape dump from
all sites. I want it played back here.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.153
And I want it in strip charts.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.613
Call sacco, tell him to put an engine
in the simulator.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.742
Feed it all the tm we've got
and see what keeps it from firing.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.536
Hard copies of everything
and an oxygen projection.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.163
Yes, sir.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.332
Mr. Keith?

25:44.793 --> 25:47.921
- Forgot all about them.
- Ted, will you get them out of here?

25:48.005 --> 25:51.383
- Ben, take this.
- Right.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.322
No retrofi re.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.035
They're still up there.

26:21.038 --> 26:25.167
It'll take a little time
to psych out the engine.

26:29.379 --> 26:35.135
Well, I guess it's time to go home and
light the fires and mind the kids.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.887
Do you need a lift?

26:36.970 --> 26:40.265
- Did you talk to them?
- Yeah.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.060
They're fine.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.069
For how long?

26:53.654 --> 26:57.741
- Well, we'll be in touch, Mrs. Stone.
- Thank you, but...

26:57.825 --> 27:00.285
I'd also like to know
what's happening.

27:01.662 --> 27:05.415
Teresa, Celia and I have been
in this business 10 years.

27:05.499 --> 27:09.586
We learned the best thing is for us
girls to keep our feelings to ourselves.

27:09.670 --> 27:13.173
And let the men get on with their jobs.

27:13.257 --> 27:17.094
- Right, Celia?
- Wrong, Betty.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.266
It's been 15 years.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.193
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry that I've kept you waiting.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.696
- Dr. Keith, are you...?
- Mr. Keith.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.419
- Are you on your way to Washington?
- No.

27:37.447 --> 27:40.576
- Spoken to the white house yet?
- No.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.788
Tell me, sir, who's responsible
for withholding the news?

27:44.872 --> 27:48.125
- Oh, I'm the responsible officer.
- Do you have a statement, Mr. Keith?

27:49.042 --> 27:51.920
No, but I would like to say that
approximately 15,000 people

27:52.004 --> 27:54.840
are trying to isolate and correct
this malfunction.

27:54.923 --> 27:58.010
Every resource of the NASA
and our industrial contractors

27:58.093 --> 28:00.721
is being used to the fullest.

28:02.389 --> 28:05.392
- Mr. Canon.
- Let me get this straight:

28:05.475 --> 28:07.853
- The spacecraft is still in orbit, right?
- Yes.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.063
Going around the world
every 94 minutes, right?

28:10.147 --> 28:11.440
That's right, Mr. Canon.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.234
How much oxygen does the crew have
for life support?

28:14.318 --> 28:15.986
They're in no immediate danger.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.406
- There's a rumor the men are dead.
- Not true.

28:20.741 --> 28:21.992
Mr. Henry?

28:22.075 --> 28:24.494
What happens if you can't
get the engine to retrofire?

28:24.578 --> 28:28.123
We're prepared for every contingency,
Mr. Henry.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.085
What happens if you can't
get the engine to fire?

28:32.169 --> 28:34.713
Does the spacecraft continue
circling around the earth

28:34.796 --> 28:37.090
until orbital decay slows it down
sufficiently

28:37.174 --> 28:38.717
for it to re-enter the atmosphere?

28:38.800 --> 28:42.512
If so, does the spacecraft and
everything in it get burnt to a crisp,

28:42.596 --> 28:45.140
- is that right?
- Well, what's your point?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.352
How long before that happens,
five years?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.229
Seven years.

28:52.314 --> 28:54.149
Have you given up hope, Mr. Keith?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.110
Certainly not, Mr. Canon.
Why should I?

28:57.194 --> 28:59.655
If you'll excuse me now, please.

29:19.883 --> 29:23.136
Strawberry cereal cubes.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.348
Soup, corn, cream.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.185
Jim, why are we just lying here
waiting, huh?

29:30.269 --> 29:33.146
For ground to analyze
the entire telemetry.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.733
So some smart-ass engineer
can tell us we're out of luck?

29:37.234 --> 29:40.737
Why not go Eva?
We'll check the engine ourselves.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.656
Maybe one of the fuel valves is frozen.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.827
No, ground could tell that.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.414
Maybe we took a meteor strike. Maybe
something hung up on separation.

29:53.792 --> 29:58.255
Just relax.
Eat your chicken while it's hot.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.677
What are you looking at, stoney?

30:07.264 --> 30:10.726
A disturbance in the inner-tropical
conversion zone.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.895
Somebody's gonna have a hurricane.

30:14.938 --> 30:19.151
- Where's the center, stoney?
- It's just northeast of Cuba.

30:20.402 --> 30:25.699
Yeah, nice thick clouds,
good east-west slope.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.993
Looks like clouding circulation's
just beginning.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.163
She's gonna be a big beast.

30:33.290 --> 30:37.919
Alma, first of the season.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.391
Houston, this is simulator.

30:51.475 --> 30:55.687
We have on the stand sps
engine unit h37 modified block four.

30:55.771 --> 30:58.190
This unit is an exact
one-to-one duplicate

30:58.273 --> 31:00.609
of the primary equipment
in ironman one.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.195
We have analyzed
the engine telemetry.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.739
And we're attempting
to construct a configuration

31:05.822 --> 31:09.326
which will reproduce the conditions
that prevented ignition.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.121
Three, two, one.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.250
Firing the engine.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.712
I say, apparently we have failed
to prevent ignition.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.507
But we'll keep working on it.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.555
All right, the president's waiting
for our recommendations.

31:30.639 --> 31:34.059
One, a statement to be issued at the
conclusion of this meeting:

31:34.142 --> 31:36.269
"Every effort is being made
to discover

31:36.353 --> 31:38.438
and correct
the spacecraft malfunction...

31:38.939 --> 31:40.941
In accordance
with contingency plans

31:41.024 --> 31:43.860
designed to meet
such emergencies."

31:43.944 --> 31:47.697
Two, a report to be issued
Tuesday morning

31:47.781 --> 31:50.367
by the director
of manned space flight.

31:50.450 --> 31:55.372
Emphasizing the high degree of safety
and success in the program thus far.

31:55.997 --> 32:01.086
The accident will be compared to
the failure of an experimental aircraft.

32:01.169 --> 32:04.631
It'll be noted that in the development
of such aircraft

32:04.714 --> 32:08.635
a 10 percent pilot loss
is considered acceptable.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.139
Now, Wednesday morning,
if necessary...

32:12.222 --> 32:16.309
The president will issue
an appropriate message to the nation.

32:16.393 --> 32:21.064
Emphasizing the courage
and determination of the crew.

32:21.148 --> 32:27.404
And their final wish, that the program
be continued without pause.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.201
Discussion?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.539
Yeah, I have something.

32:38.999 --> 32:41.918
I want to talk about a rescue mission.

32:42.002 --> 32:45.547
I'm speaking for the pilots
and some of the air force boys.

32:46.381 --> 32:50.177
We propose launching a rescue craft
using one of their boosters.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.929
Rendezvous with ironman,
transfer crew and return to earth.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.764
Dougherty, you haven't
been listening.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.850
Courtney, will you repeat
that trend data

32:56.933 --> 32:59.436
on oxygen consumption
in the spacecraft?

32:59.519 --> 33:02.564
As of now, they're going to live
another 42 hours.

33:02.647 --> 33:07.360
Plus or minus two percent. Now, that
takes us up to 10:30 Monday night.

33:07.444 --> 33:10.822
There's a launch window for a shot
at 8:48 Monday night.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.074
Nothing to put in that window.

33:13.158 --> 33:17.078
An air force titan 3c left Denver
for the cape one hour ago.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.372
Oh, actually it was already in the pipe.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.666
And also the xrv lifting body
from Edwards.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.085
Can you get the titan and an xrv

33:24.169 --> 33:28.256
- on the pad ready to go in 42 hours?
- Some of our boys think they could.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.384
A non-man-rated booster
and a craft that's never flown.

33:31.468 --> 33:35.472
Oh, it'll fly all right, and dougherty
here has all the qualifications.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.893
Proposal is rejected.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.478
Anything else?

33:43.980 --> 33:45.857
Yeah, what do I tell the pilots?

33:45.941 --> 33:49.486
Tell them that the request is outside
the area of their competence.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.240
- We've got three men dying.
- They're professionals.

33:53.323 --> 33:56.117
If they were here they'd say,
"take what you've learned.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.410
Get on with the next mission."

33:57.494 --> 33:59.663
I don't give a damn
about the next mission!

33:59.746 --> 34:02.415
There's no room in this program
for a chief astronaut

34:02.499 --> 34:04.334
who cannot look
at the whole picture.

34:05.502 --> 34:06.670
Then you fire me.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.092
You want to launch a rescue mission
in 42 hours...

34:12.175 --> 34:13.718
All right.

34:14.511 --> 34:20.433
One: Assemble and check out booster
stage one, stage two and trans stage.

34:20.517 --> 34:22.310
How long, on past performance?

34:22.394 --> 34:24.854
Well, on past performance, 12 days,
but if we were...

34:24.938 --> 34:26.523
Twelve days.

34:26.606 --> 34:30.860
Two: Build up and strap on
solid fuel stacks.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.405
- Four days, but we can...
- Four days.

34:33.488 --> 34:36.616
Check launch weather for Monday
night. There's a hurricane out there.

34:36.700 --> 34:39.452
600 miles off the coast
and headed out to sea.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.455
Well, you're in luck. Three: Make
the vehicle to the bird

34:42.539 --> 34:44.833
and check out configuration.
How long, colonel?

34:45.375 --> 34:47.419
- Bob?
- We haven't any accurate way

34:47.502 --> 34:51.506
- to determine the minimum time...
- Couldn't do it under five days.

34:51.590 --> 34:54.092
Four: Compute navigation
and guidance tapes

34:54.175 --> 34:59.764
for first apogee rendezvous,
10 days. Program computers...

34:59.848 --> 35:01.766
- Three weeks.
- We'll go without a computer.

35:01.850 --> 35:04.853
- We'll go without a checkup.
- And crew training in a craft

35:04.936 --> 35:09.065
which has not been man-rated,
which cannot be flown by one pilot

35:09.149 --> 35:12.485
and which has not been modified
to hold four men.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.779
How about that one?

35:14.863 --> 35:17.574
They'll do it in 42 hours.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.287
While you're assembling
your rescue ship in 42 hours

35:22.370 --> 35:24.748
and spending...
How much would that cost, Fisher?

35:24.831 --> 35:26.541
- Fifty million.
- So what?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.336
Plus how many deaths?

35:30.629 --> 35:34.132
- Jimmy?
- In a program of this magnitude

35:34.215 --> 35:37.510
in which all nominal safety factors
are disregarded

35:37.594 --> 35:40.722
I calculate .02 percent
of the workforce...

35:40.805 --> 35:43.183
How the hell do you know
how many people will die?

35:43.266 --> 35:45.602
Think we haven't considered rescue?
Here it is.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.229
Rescue and every other contingency.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.524
Reduced to digitals
and computerized.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.277
You helped to write it.

35:54.361 --> 35:58.531
- A rational approach.
- Well, screw your rational approach.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.450
Three of your pilots are in trouble.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.036
And if you don't try to get them down,
well, god damn you!

36:04.621 --> 36:07.540
Well, you have feelings. Good.
I have feelings.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.752
That's why we live by the rules.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.881
Wheeler. Courtney.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.884
Fisher. Klein.

36:17.967 --> 36:20.011
Deg rote.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.263
Those men up there
are your friends.

36:22.347 --> 36:26.643
Can you launch a rescue mission
in 42 hours?

36:34.526 --> 36:38.071
- Yeah, all right.
- Are you ready to talk to him now?

36:38.154 --> 36:41.032
- We're ready at this end.
- The president will take your call

36:41.116 --> 36:44.828
- at 7:00 our time.
- Very good.

36:44.911 --> 36:49.082
The president will take the call
at 7:00 his time.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.420
That leaves us an hour
and 15 minutes.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.440
- Your license, please...
- Officer, I'm a government official.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.150
- I'm in a hurry.
- I can see that.

37:57.233 --> 38:01.029
Here's security, q clearance,
top secret.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.907
You've got a lot on your mind,
all right. That's how it happens.

38:03.990 --> 38:07.660
- You forget where you are and wham.
- I've got to get to a telephone.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.204
Shut off your engine.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.664
I'm Charles Keith, head
of manned space.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.874
I know who you are.

38:12.957 --> 38:18.671
Bsg-2896553, another code three,
Charles Raymond Keith.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.508
You have no brake lights.
Your license is expired.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.690
You may get to the moon,
but mister you're a menace on the highway.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.679
- Are you Charles Raymond Keith?
- Yes!

38:26.763 --> 38:29.432
Somebody named Olympus
wants to talk to you.

38:35.355 --> 38:39.776
Can you patch me into command
network, baker to Olympus?

38:40.443 --> 38:42.362
Keith, where are you?

38:42.445 --> 38:45.698
Mr. President, I have a sort of
a problem here.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.076
What do you have for me?

38:48.159 --> 38:50.703
Well, we're analyzing
the engine telemetry.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.706
We've got a contractor
running a similar engine

38:53.790 --> 38:56.751
in a failure mode,
and we're running down the history

38:56.835 --> 38:59.003
of all the hardware
in the spacecraft.

38:59.087 --> 39:02.173
What else can you do
besides what you're doing?

39:02.257 --> 39:04.425
I don't think there's anything else.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.095
Have you fellas considered rescue?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.180
Yes, we've discussed it, of course.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.266
What do you think?

39:11.808 --> 39:18.314
Well, sir, it's a very,
very remote possibility.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.984
Charles, can I talk to you as a friend?

39:21.067 --> 39:22.735
Well, yes, sir, of course.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.196
You're right,
and for the right reasons.

39:25.280 --> 39:29.742
But if we do it your way, 200 million
people are going to start raising hell.

39:29.826 --> 39:33.746
Well, Mr. President, it's not my way.
There is data

39:33.830 --> 39:37.000
and there are certain facts
that we have to deal with.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.587
Charles, just put away your slide rule
for a minute and listen.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.755
There's more going on here
than logic.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.966
The world is watching us
and what we do

39:45.049 --> 39:46.759
about rescuing these men.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.429
To say that there's nothing
we can do

39:49.512 --> 39:53.641
is going to be disaster for me,
for you and for your program.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.020
We have to take a crack at it
with the very best we've got.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.439
Now, what do you say, Charles?

40:02.233 --> 40:08.364
Mr. President, it'll be a dangerous
gamble, but we'll go if you say so.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.367
Charles, you let me know how you're
doing and what you need.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.286
Whatever you want, you've got it.

40:22.295 --> 40:25.590
Confirmed tonight that
the sps engine failed to fire,

40:25.673 --> 40:27.800
leaving america's three astronauts
in orbit

40:27.884 --> 40:32.847
some 285 miles above the earth,
circling the globe every 94 minutes.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.808
They are now approaching
the west coast of Africa.

40:35.892 --> 40:39.062
No word has been issued
as to the cause of the malfunction

40:39.145 --> 40:42.815
beyond the statement made by
Dr. Keith at the news conference

40:42.899 --> 40:44.484
held this morning in...

40:44.567 --> 40:46.986
That contingency plans
have been developed

40:47.070 --> 40:49.405
to meet every conceivable
emergency.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.617
It has been reported from
mission control in Houston

40:52.700 --> 40:55.495
that the three astronauts are...

41:04.295 --> 41:07.090
Okay, buzz, you're right.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.843
To hell with waiting for a bunch
of slide-rule jockeys.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.846
We used to fix the airplanes we flew
with paper clips.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.516
Let's get into our hard suits
and fix this bird.

41:16.599 --> 41:19.519
- Okay, Jimmy.
- You watch the store, will you, stoney?

41:19.602 --> 41:21.854
Yeah, go.

41:21.938 --> 41:25.108
- Ironman one this is Houston flight.
- Go, Houston.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.944
We're coming up to get you, ironman.

41:28.528 --> 41:29.862
Say again.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.364
We're coming to get you.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.908
We're launching a rescue mission
from the cape.

41:33.992 --> 41:39.122
We're using a titan 3c with an xrv
lifting body modified to hold four men.

41:39.205 --> 41:42.000
The pilot is Ted dougherty.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.128
Do you read, ironman?

41:45.211 --> 41:47.880
Yeah, yeah, we read you.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.341
Houston, when do you estimate
launch?

41:50.425 --> 41:52.135
Just over 40 hours, stoney.

41:53.219 --> 41:57.223
Forty hours? Who are they kidding?

41:58.808 --> 42:00.226
Do you read, ironman?

42:01.978 --> 42:03.980
We've decided to make
a move up here.

42:04.063 --> 42:08.151
Go Eva and eyeball the engines.
The fuel valves could be frozen.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.903
We'll pull the insulating hatches.
If they are

42:10.987 --> 42:13.614
we'll get in the sun
and get some heat on them.

42:14.574 --> 42:17.785
That's an interesting thought,
but we have no indication

42:17.869 --> 42:20.580
of that here or anything else
you could correct.

42:20.663 --> 42:23.124
We're all agreed
the rescue mission is it.

42:23.207 --> 42:27.503
We're agreed we have to take
affirmative action to repair our vehicle.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.380
Ironman, stand by one.

42:30.006 --> 42:32.967
Tell them negative, Jimmy, negative.

42:33.051 --> 42:36.804
Jim, we appreciate your desire
to take affirmative action

42:36.888 --> 42:40.933
and we need your affirmative action
if the mission is to succeed.

42:41.017 --> 42:44.228
The most critical factor
is your oxygen supply.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.024
To get 15 minutes of activity
outside the spacecraft

42:48.107 --> 42:50.943
to eyeball the engine,
you have to trade off

42:51.027 --> 42:53.946
three or four hours
of passive breathing.

42:54.030 --> 42:57.950
From where we sit you don't have
that oxygen to spare.

42:58.034 --> 43:03.331
Therefore, we'd like to suggest
that you go into low-tide mode...

43:03.414 --> 43:07.960
Lower your oxygen pressure to 3.5...

43:08.044 --> 43:10.630
Execute a full emergency
power down...

43:10.713 --> 43:12.799
And take your pills.

43:12.882 --> 43:15.510
They want us to buy it
while we're sleeping.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.473
Do you copy, ironman?

43:21.057 --> 43:24.060
Yeah. We're thinking about it.

43:25.853 --> 43:28.272
Tell them negative, Jim, negative.

43:31.109 --> 43:34.028
Pruett, now, this is Keith.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.322
I'm down here at the cape
with sadler

43:36.405 --> 43:39.033
and we're getting this rescue shot
ready to go.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.952
Don't do anything foolish.

43:41.035 --> 43:44.163
Don't climb into your hard suits.
Don't get out your tools

43:44.247 --> 43:46.249
and don't try to fix the engine.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.334
Just take your pills and go to sleep.

43:50.086 --> 43:51.838
Can you get us down, boss?

43:51.921 --> 43:54.006
We've got a better chance
than you do.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.008
- We'll be back at you.
- Rogen

43:56.092 --> 43:58.094
yeah, he's lying.

43:58.886 --> 44:03.474
Buzz, you eat up 25 percent more
oxygen every time you lose your cool.

44:07.895 --> 44:12.024
Houston, ironman, preparing
for power down.

44:12.108 --> 44:14.277
Roger, ironman.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.821
What are the numbers, stoney?

44:19.282 --> 44:24.203
Well, with nominal oxygen usage,
I make it 36 hours left.

44:24.287 --> 44:29.709
Take out the pad, 40 hours,
more or less.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.921
How you figuring the residual
amounts in the tanks?

44:34.005 --> 44:37.049
How would you?

44:37.133 --> 44:42.430
Yeah, you'd have to breathe
them dry to find out.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.057
No one's ever done that.

44:45.141 --> 44:48.519
Yeah, well, I got the feeling
we just may be the first.

45:17.173 --> 45:21.177
Royce Fitzgerald, call 10-993.

45:31.062 --> 45:35.316
Resume count-off,
my Mark at minus 240.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.593
Pull the gnn circuit breakers
and the imu heater breakers.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.971
Circuit breakers off.

46:05.054 --> 46:08.099
Shut down the attitude
control system.

46:10.184 --> 46:12.228
Shut down number two
and three fuel cells.

46:12.311 --> 46:15.106
We'll leave one on the line in
case we have to charge.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.149
Two and three off.
What about the comm?

46:17.233 --> 46:18.693
No, we'll leave it on.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.528
Flood lights off.

46:22.989 --> 46:24.824
El off.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.411
Buzz, are the lower equipment
bays dark?

46:28.911 --> 46:31.205
The b lights are off.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.251
Then why isn't that off?

46:36.335 --> 46:38.254
I don't know why.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.384
Houston, ironman.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.721
- We're cranked down.
- Copy, Jim.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.141
We'll check in when you come
over the hill at Guaymas.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.977
We're gonna keep you informed
every step of the way.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.395
Get some sleep now.

46:54.478 --> 46:57.064
- In a while.
- Jim, this is Courtney.

46:57.148 --> 47:00.109
I want you to take one tablet
of stryzene after every meal

47:00.192 --> 47:02.069
and one when you
complete power down.

47:02.153 --> 47:04.155
You can drink as much water
as you want.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.657
Every word, every emotion
costs oxygen

47:06.741 --> 47:09.327
so the more relaxed you are,
the better.

47:09.410 --> 47:13.581
All right, you bums,
take your pills and go to sleep.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.374
Hey! Hello, big brother.

47:15.458 --> 47:17.376
- Hey, Ted.
- Hi, stoney.

47:17.460 --> 47:20.212
Hey, where are you?
What's all the racket?

47:20.296 --> 47:23.883
Well, I'm in huntsville,
kluging up a simulator to the xrv.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.092
Say again?

47:25.176 --> 47:26.218
A simulator to the xrv.

47:26.302 --> 47:30.097
I'm gonna do a little pressure
up here before I take it to the cape.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.600
This is a great time to start learning
how to fly it.

47:32.683 --> 47:36.062
All you guys gotta worry about is
where you want me to set you down

47:36.145 --> 47:37.813
after I make the transfer.

47:37.897 --> 47:39.231
Go on, pick your spot.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.026
Edwards, Vegas,
how about the beach in Malibu?

47:42.109 --> 47:43.235
Why not?

47:43.319 --> 47:47.323
All right, take your pills, go to sleep
and leave the driving to us.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.993
I'll see you in 39 hours
and 16 minutes.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.294
Simulation will begin in 10 minutes.

48:42.378 --> 48:46.757
Maintain rf silence
until further notice.

48:47.383 --> 48:48.676
How does it look to you?

48:48.759 --> 48:51.720
The xrv will leave in two hours,
be on the pad in five.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.473
That gives you nine hours.
You're not gonna make it.

48:54.557 --> 48:57.309
We've got eight separate systems
to verify.

48:57.393 --> 49:00.521
- I don't know how to do it any faster...
- Here.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.289
That's how you're gonna do it.

49:18.873 --> 49:22.251
Colonel, you've got automatic backups
designed into all your systems.

49:22.334 --> 49:25.421
Now you're gonna find out
if they work.

49:44.023 --> 49:47.318
Range 6-5, range 2-4.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.529
A little under.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.365
Three-point-four second vert.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.576
Range 6-3, range 2-1.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.620
Missed his target by 20 miles.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.455
Col. Dougherty, you've overshot.

50:02.291 --> 50:04.919
Yeah, I know.
I missed it by 20 miles.

50:06.378 --> 50:10.674
Is it possible to break down
the program into segments...

50:10.758 --> 50:13.385
To repeat dpi to rendezvous?

50:13.469 --> 50:15.846
No, we don't have the time
to break up the tapes.

50:15.930 --> 50:17.473
Okay.

50:18.557 --> 50:21.685
Can we recycle fast time
from launch to first delta v

50:21.769 --> 50:23.354
and real time from then?

50:23.437 --> 50:25.439
Okay, will do.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.907
All right, let's go again.

50:36.325 --> 50:38.410
The tape is ready.

50:38.494 --> 50:41.413
On my Mark, first delta v burn.

50:41.497 --> 50:45.417
Three, two, one, ignition.

50:45.501 --> 50:47.795
Roger, I have ignition.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.506
Timer on and counting.

51:33.632 --> 51:37.261
We have a new apt,
and it's not good.

51:42.182 --> 51:45.269
- It's turned.
- Sure has.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.021
How soon will it get here?

51:47.104 --> 51:48.772
What do you think?

51:49.273 --> 51:50.608
Eight hours, major.

51:50.691 --> 51:53.569
Seven, maybe eight.

51:53.652 --> 51:55.613
It's gonna be a tight fit.

52:03.287 --> 52:04.663
All right.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.591
Keith speaking.

52:16.592 --> 52:18.594
Yes, okay. Okay.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.807
- Hello, Mr. President?
- The hurricane.

52:23.891 --> 52:25.559
Well, it changed course.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.646
Eighty-mile winds heading straight
for us.

52:28.729 --> 52:32.608
Well, we can launch in winds
up to 45 miles per hour.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.737
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure, sir.
I wrote it.

52:38.614 --> 52:40.991
No, they can't help us.
I've already talked to them.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.535
I know kashvin pretty well.

52:43.619 --> 52:48.457
You see, their voshkod's
in the wrong orbit, won't wash.

52:50.376 --> 52:54.546
We can't launch any earlier, sir.
We have to go precisely at 8:48.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.549
Well, what are you gonna do?

52:57.633 --> 53:00.052
We just keep going.

53:00.135 --> 53:01.929
Keep plugging.

53:09.228 --> 53:12.731
Deep, dreamless sleep.
That's a nice adjustment.

53:21.490 --> 53:22.574
Nightmare?

53:22.658 --> 53:27.037
He's an angry, active guy.
Frustrated. He's helpless.

53:27.121 --> 53:30.040
- Can we give him something to do?
- No.

53:34.461 --> 53:36.672
He's not taking his pills.

53:38.048 --> 53:40.342
He's got a lot to think about.

53:40.426 --> 53:42.845
The sleep period
should be terminated.

53:43.679 --> 53:46.390
All right, but tell mission control
not to keep him busy.

53:46.473 --> 53:49.685
- Kid him along, keep him informed.
- Yes, sir.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.604
Houston Capcom, this is Courtney.

53:52.688 --> 53:55.023
This is Houston, Capcom, frank piro.

53:55.107 --> 53:56.608
Frank, wake them up.

53:56.692 --> 54:00.612
And, frank, Mr. Keith does not want
you to try to keep them busy.

54:00.696 --> 54:03.615
Just keep them informed,
kid them along.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.701
Understood.

54:11.915 --> 54:14.710
The sleep period is terminated.

54:17.588 --> 54:20.632
Hi, fellas! We see you're awake now.

54:20.716 --> 54:23.427
Thought we'd bring you up to date
on mission status.

54:23.510 --> 54:25.471
The solid stacks
are being strapped on

54:25.554 --> 54:29.099
and we'll be moving the bird
on the pad in about nine hours.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.643
Say, here's a little item
of space news.

54:31.727 --> 54:35.063
The Russians have just launched
another voshkod.

54:35.147 --> 54:39.318
Would you believe it's carrying a
red army all-girl marching band?

54:42.154 --> 54:44.406
Say, you guys still asleep?

54:44.490 --> 54:47.075
No, we're having a wild party.

54:47.159 --> 54:48.744
Hey, that's pretty funny.

54:49.369 --> 54:52.539
You sure you're taking
your quiet pills?

54:52.623 --> 54:54.333
We are, but the girls aren't.

54:56.752 --> 54:58.837
Well, have fun.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.757
Roger, Houston.

55:11.767 --> 55:13.769
You never wind down,
do you, stoney?

55:13.852 --> 55:15.854
No, never do.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.484
I just do the job I was trained for:

55:20.567 --> 55:24.988
I observe systems under stress.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.658
Okay.

55:29.034 --> 55:31.787
I'll give you some data points.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.165
You know what I'm thinking now?

55:36.250 --> 55:39.795
I'm thinking I never made
enough money in this business.

55:41.004 --> 55:44.508
How do some of those pilots
make so much money?

55:45.676 --> 55:47.594
I don't have a dime.

55:50.806 --> 55:52.683
Are you getting all that?

55:52.766 --> 55:54.977
Yeah. Yeah, getting all that.

55:56.812 --> 55:58.897
I'll tell you something else.

56:00.566 --> 56:02.985
I'll never get the Mars shot.

56:05.070 --> 56:07.990
You know why? I'm too old.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.746
How about that?

56:20.836 --> 56:23.255
Why are you doing that?

56:23.338 --> 56:26.717
- Relax, buzz.
- Don't tell me what to do.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.809
Hey, buzz, you...

56:36.602 --> 56:39.938
You remember that psychologist
at Brooks?

56:40.731 --> 56:42.774
The one with the blank sheet
of paper?

56:42.858 --> 56:44.860
I don't remember.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.863
Sure. Sure, you remember.

56:48.447 --> 56:51.491
He held up a blank sheet
of paper and said:

56:51.575 --> 56:53.660
"What do you see?"

56:53.744 --> 56:56.204
- I don't remember.
- What did you see?

56:56.288 --> 56:57.873
Who, me?

56:58.957 --> 57:01.335
I saw a blank sheet of paper.

57:02.878 --> 57:05.047
No imagination.

57:05.130 --> 57:08.467
No, no. Devotion to truth.

57:11.011 --> 57:14.306
Why don't you take that Ph.D.
and shove it?

57:16.850 --> 57:18.936
What are you gonna do
when you finish that?

57:19.019 --> 57:20.812
Drop it out the window in a bottle?

57:20.896 --> 57:22.898
No, I'm the scientist.

57:22.981 --> 57:25.901
I rely on the pilot to get me places.

57:25.984 --> 57:31.114
If we'd had a couple more pilots, we'd
be out there instead of laying here.

57:33.575 --> 57:36.995
Jim, what did you see when the
psychologist held up the paper?

57:37.079 --> 57:40.248
They didn't have all that jazz
when I came in.

57:40.916 --> 57:43.877
I saw a field covered with snow.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.300
And underneath, there was new oats.

57:53.929 --> 57:57.641
And then the snow melted,
and the field turned to green.

58:03.563 --> 58:07.693
But the psychologist said I was wrong,
it was just a blank sheet of paper.

58:10.153 --> 58:11.780
They took you anyway?

58:12.698 --> 58:14.324
Yeah, I guess they made a mistake.

58:14.408 --> 58:17.744
No, no. They don't make mistakes.

58:19.955 --> 58:21.957
That's right, I forgot.

58:23.041 --> 58:25.669
They don't make mistakes, do they?

58:35.095 --> 58:36.805
Ironman one.

58:36.888 --> 58:39.599
Ironman one, goldstone,
do you read?

58:39.683 --> 58:40.976
Yeah. Go, goldstone.

58:41.059 --> 58:44.187
You might want to look
out your window, Jim.

58:44.271 --> 58:45.397
What for?

58:45.480 --> 58:48.900
There's somebody down there
that wants to say something to you.

58:49.443 --> 58:50.736
Say again?

58:50.819 --> 58:53.071
Why don't you look
out your window?

59:10.297 --> 59:14.426
That's San Diego, Jim.
Your hometown, saying hello.

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:07.562
Suspended beneath
the air force ca3 helicopter,

1:00:07.646 --> 1:00:10.232
the xrv is on its way
to the launch pad.

1:00:10.315 --> 1:00:12.984
A flying wedge,
shaped much like a thick arrowhead,

1:00:13.068 --> 1:00:15.987
the xrv has never before been
in space.

1:00:16.071 --> 1:00:19.616
When it makes its first flight, col.
Dougherty will be going it alone

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:21.993
because that bird was designed
for two men

1:00:22.077 --> 1:00:24.996
but now has been modified,
of course, to carry four men.

1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:27.332
Col. Dougherty will be
on his way to bring home

1:00:27.415 --> 1:00:29.668
the three astronauts
of ironman one.

1:00:29.751 --> 1:00:31.837
That xrv will plunge
into the atmosphere

1:00:31.920 --> 1:00:35.715
at 17,000 miles per hour, a
flaming meteor coming back to earth.

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.135
When it breaks down
into the lower atmosphere

1:00:38.218 --> 1:00:41.763
the speed will drop to only
a few hundred miles per hour

1:00:41.847 --> 1:00:44.516
and dougherty will be flying
a high-speed glider,

1:00:44.599 --> 1:00:46.017
an airplane without power.

1:00:46.101 --> 1:00:49.229
He'll take that bird straight in towards
Edwards air force base

1:00:49.312 --> 1:00:52.524
to land on the long runway out there
in the California desert.

1:02:24.199 --> 1:02:26.117
Hello, Ted.

1:02:26.201 --> 1:02:28.119
Thirty-six hours and 15 minutes.
Great, Ted.

1:02:28.203 --> 1:02:30.830
- What about the hurricane?
- Heading straight for us.

1:02:30.914 --> 1:02:32.999
- When did it turn?
- About six hours ago.

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:36.169
- When do we get it?
- 75-knot winds by 9:00.

1:02:36.253 --> 1:02:38.713
- They said it was headed to sea.
- They were wrong.

1:02:38.797 --> 1:02:41.424
How in the hell can they make
a mistake like that?

1:02:41.508 --> 1:02:45.929
Stop wasting your energy. It changed
course once, it can change again.

1:03:08.576 --> 1:03:10.704
How are the children, Teresa?

1:03:11.246 --> 1:03:13.123
Fine.

1:03:13.957 --> 1:03:16.751
Mine are home studying for exams.

1:03:16.835 --> 1:03:20.255
Boy, they sure are putting
the pressure on at school these days.

1:03:26.219 --> 1:03:28.513
It'll just be a minute.

1:03:28.596 --> 1:03:30.640
I should caution you.

1:03:30.724 --> 1:03:34.185
You're going to notice
some degeneration.

1:03:34.269 --> 1:03:37.188
But it's important to show them
how confident you are.

1:03:37.272 --> 1:03:39.399
We understand, dick.
We won't let you down.

1:03:39.482 --> 1:03:40.984
You want us to be confident?

1:03:41.067 --> 1:03:44.654
The more relaxed they are,
the less oxygen they use.

1:03:44.738 --> 1:03:49.451
I know why we're here.
You're letting us say goodbye.

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:51.411
Wyman's report to contact.

1:04:06.301 --> 1:04:08.345
- Hi, Celia.
- Hi, frank.

1:04:11.765 --> 1:04:12.932
It's Jim.

1:04:13.016 --> 1:04:15.935
- Frank, take it off for a minute.
- All right.

1:04:19.731 --> 1:04:21.232
Celia.

1:04:21.316 --> 1:04:24.944
Celia, we're gonna talk to him
on the monitor up here.

1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:46.841
Celia.

1:04:46.925 --> 1:04:49.344
Well, here I am again.

1:04:53.973 --> 1:04:56.976
Everybody's been so nice.

1:04:58.311 --> 1:05:00.939
I spoke to your father today.

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:03.400
And he says to say hello.

1:05:03.483 --> 1:05:06.194
His cold, it seemed better.

1:05:07.362 --> 1:05:10.615
I bought some new shoes.

1:05:10.698 --> 1:05:12.367
They hurt.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:15.912
And the kids?

1:05:15.995 --> 1:05:18.373
Oh, fine, fine.

1:05:18.873 --> 1:05:21.292
I lost the bill to the insurance.

1:05:21.376 --> 1:05:25.713
I thought I had it paid, and then
just this morning, I got a letter.

1:05:26.381 --> 1:05:28.800
Listen, babe, I...

1:05:28.883 --> 1:05:31.386
I just want to tell you
that I love you.

1:05:35.390 --> 1:05:37.392
I said, I love you.

1:05:40.145 --> 1:05:42.230
I just wanted you to know.

1:05:43.523 --> 1:05:45.817
I know that.

1:05:47.026 --> 1:05:48.987
I just wanted to make sure.

1:05:51.781 --> 1:05:54.033
Is it very lonely where you are?

1:05:58.204 --> 1:06:02.041
No, not for long.

1:06:02.625 --> 1:06:05.420
We all have great confidence.

1:06:10.675 --> 1:06:14.179
Celia, if you have any more
problems with the insurance

1:06:14.262 --> 1:06:17.348
or the house
or anything like that...

1:06:17.432 --> 1:06:19.934
You can talk to dougherty.
He's a good guy.

1:06:20.018 --> 1:06:21.519
You can depend on him.

1:06:21.603 --> 1:06:24.439
I gave him a kiss to give you
when he sees you.

1:06:27.484 --> 1:06:30.737
Yeah, that's just what I need.

1:06:30.820 --> 1:06:33.072
You never can tell.

1:06:42.707 --> 1:06:47.337
- Well, I gotta go now.
- No, not yet.

1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:02.936
Celia, I...

1:07:03.811 --> 1:07:06.439
I had a real good day today.

1:07:07.315 --> 1:07:09.025
And...

1:07:10.151 --> 1:07:13.780
You know,
when you think about this...

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:19.577
I want you to remember
I had a real good day.

1:07:28.503 --> 1:07:30.630
We better cut it off now.

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:36.010
Oh, there's one more thing
that I have to tell you.

1:07:38.888 --> 1:07:42.183
I lost five pounds last week.

1:07:42.267 --> 1:07:45.061
I can't wait till you see me.

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:56.447
You take care of yourself.

1:07:57.574 --> 1:07:59.033
Take care.

1:08:25.268 --> 1:08:27.478
Hi, sport.

1:08:27.562 --> 1:08:28.730
Hiya, kid.

1:08:29.564 --> 1:08:31.566
How are the mice?

1:08:32.567 --> 1:08:35.612
Well, we're learning
something every day.

1:08:35.695 --> 1:08:37.572
You writing a big, dull book
up there?

1:08:38.323 --> 1:08:41.868
No. No, a small, dull book.

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:43.578
How are you?

1:08:44.746 --> 1:08:48.916
I'm working on a little project.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:53.379
I've developed an experimental
hypothesis for you to proof out.

1:08:53.463 --> 1:08:56.507
Have you? Well, what is it?

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.594
I miss you like mad.

1:09:08.061 --> 1:09:10.313
Your paper came out last week.

1:09:10.897 --> 1:09:13.524
Professor stavel said
it's a brilliant presentation.

1:09:13.608 --> 1:09:16.653
It was the best he's ever read.

1:09:16.736 --> 1:09:18.446
We're gonna make it, Teresa.

1:09:19.614 --> 1:09:22.283
- We're gonna make it back.
- What?

1:09:22.367 --> 1:09:24.535
We're gonna make it back.

1:09:24.619 --> 1:09:27.622
- I know.
- Believe me.

1:09:27.705 --> 1:09:31.876
- Yes.
- I mean it, we're all coming back.

1:09:38.633 --> 1:09:41.094
Listen, Teresa, I...

1:09:41.636 --> 1:09:44.847
I want you and the kids to...

1:09:49.644 --> 1:09:52.855
Look, I have to go now.

1:09:53.439 --> 1:09:55.566
- I'll be seeing you.
- Stoney.

1:09:55.650 --> 1:09:57.276
I'll be seeing you.

1:09:58.444 --> 1:10:00.363
No, no.

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:03.074
I love you, remember that.

1:10:04.992 --> 1:10:06.828
Remember that.

1:10:20.967 --> 1:10:22.677
Buzz?

1:10:26.264 --> 1:10:29.934
General leclair called all the way
from Clark's field.

1:10:30.017 --> 1:10:33.563
- I thought that was so nice.
- Yeah.

1:10:34.105 --> 1:10:36.607
They want to give you something,
a scroll or...

1:10:36.691 --> 1:10:38.735
Look, hon...

1:10:39.986 --> 1:10:43.239
You don't seem to understand,
it's all falling apart up here.

1:10:43.322 --> 1:10:44.907
You understand?

1:10:44.991 --> 1:10:46.909
I understand, buzz.

1:10:46.993 --> 1:10:49.036
You see...

1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:52.790
I broke the washing machine,
and now I can't fix it.

1:10:54.208 --> 1:10:56.002
I understand how you feel.

1:10:56.711 --> 1:10:58.755
I could fix it if they'd
give me the tools.

1:10:59.589 --> 1:11:01.090
But they won't.

1:11:01.632 --> 1:11:06.053
Listen, honey, I wrote something.
We're all gonna sign it.

1:11:06.137 --> 1:11:08.639
- Do you want to hear it?
- What?

1:11:08.723 --> 1:11:12.310
"To the president, the white house,
Washington D.C.:

1:11:12.894 --> 1:11:14.979
Dear Mr. President...

1:11:15.062 --> 1:11:17.815
We just wanted to let you know
how much we appreciate...

1:11:17.899 --> 1:11:20.651
The heroic action
to save our husbands.

1:11:20.735 --> 1:11:23.571
We are grateful to you
and to everyone in the nation.

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:27.658
The team effort of the past two days
will be an inspiration to us,

1:11:27.742 --> 1:11:29.285
our children and our..."

1:11:29.368 --> 1:11:33.790
Don't you understand? It's all
falling apart and they're blaming me.

1:11:35.041 --> 1:11:36.751
I don't feel very good.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:42.256
Buzz“.

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:46.594
I have to go now.

1:11:47.762 --> 1:11:51.766
I love you. I'll see you later.

1:12:04.028 --> 1:12:08.074
Can you give me a reading on your
partial pressure of carbon dioxide?

1:12:08.157 --> 1:12:09.784
Thank you, dick.
I'll be all right.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:12.161
I just gave you that!

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:14.455
Negative, buzz.

1:12:15.289 --> 1:12:16.707
Negative, you gave me a ps...

1:12:16.791 --> 1:12:20.461
What difference does it make?
What's going on down there?

1:12:20.545 --> 1:12:22.338
Why don't you get us out of here?

1:12:22.421 --> 1:12:25.758
Get a hold of him, Jim.
Keep him away from the controls!

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:28.803
- Get us out...
- Sedate him, Jim, sedate him.

1:12:30.054 --> 1:12:31.722
Buzz?

1:12:31.806 --> 1:12:34.183
Come on. Buzz.

1:12:35.810 --> 1:12:39.021
Now just get us out of here,
that's all! Come on!

1:12:39.814 --> 1:12:42.275
Come on! Leave me alone!

1:12:51.826 --> 1:12:54.036
Don't kill me!

1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:55.746
Don't kill me!

1:12:55.830 --> 1:12:57.832
It's not my fault!

1:13:02.712 --> 1:13:04.463
Why'd you bring in his goddamn wife?

1:13:04.547 --> 1:13:07.174
Keep him sedated,
keep him away from the controls.

1:13:07.258 --> 1:13:08.843
Do you understand me?

1:13:10.428 --> 1:13:12.847
You just get dougherty off the pad.

1:13:18.519 --> 1:13:20.479
He's tired, that's all.

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:23.232
Everybody's tired.

1:14:52.446 --> 1:14:54.865
Fuel is complete.

1:14:54.949 --> 1:14:58.160
Your final numbers:
Insertion into xrv, 8:36,

1:14:58.244 --> 1:15:01.288
hack sealed cabins burst, 8:42,

1:15:01.372 --> 1:15:04.875
liftoff, 8:48, rendezvous, 9:33.

1:15:04.959 --> 1:15:07.420
Roger, how's the wind?

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:09.797
Thirty-two knots and climbing.

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:12.675
- It's not changing course?
- Nope.

1:15:14.051 --> 1:15:16.137
Well, buzz, you're right.

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.431
This whole damn thing
is impossible.

1:15:18.514 --> 1:15:20.266
No, you were right.

1:15:20.349 --> 1:15:22.685
We're gonna do it anyway.

1:17:23.222 --> 1:17:25.307
We're in position for launch.

1:17:33.065 --> 1:17:35.943
- Do you read me, Ted?
- Rogen

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:43.409
Oxygen okay?

1:18:05.931 --> 1:18:07.808
- Flight network.
- Go ahead.

1:18:07.892 --> 1:18:11.228
We have a problem with
the liftoff on the ks system

1:18:11.312 --> 1:18:13.647
but fido's prepared
to back it up.

1:18:13.731 --> 1:18:16.150
- Copy that, fido?
- Affirmative, flight.

1:18:20.654 --> 1:18:23.741
All personnel in the control room
be advised

1:18:23.824 --> 1:18:27.077
that prior to 1:20, we'll call
a hold if we have a problem.

1:18:27.161 --> 1:18:29.997
After 1:20, there is no hold.

1:18:31.123 --> 1:18:33.334
- Okay, Emil, how you doing?
- Go on three.

1:18:33.417 --> 1:18:37.129
- Emil, repeated configuration, right?
- That's right.

1:18:37.213 --> 1:18:40.174
All right.

1:18:42.760 --> 1:18:44.845
Raising the hatch cover.

1:18:44.929 --> 1:18:48.098

1:19:34.937 --> 1:19:36.146
Shroud secure.

1:19:36.230 --> 1:19:40.651
Launch control, this is rescue,
radio is on.

1:19:42.987 --> 1:19:48.158
Roger, all personnel
clear the launch area.

1:19:48.242 --> 1:19:50.035

- ld, this is ald.
- Go ahead.

1:20:35.122 --> 1:20:37.875
Range status is go,
global network status is go.

1:20:37.958 --> 1:20:40.794
Roger, that completes
all items on page 420.

1:20:40.878 --> 1:20:42.713
- Ld, instrumentation.

Unless we get another computation
on the q Alpha beta plot

1:21:08.947 --> 1:21:10.240
we may have to hold.

1:21:10.324 --> 1:21:13.327
Unless I receive a go from you
on that, I will initiate a hold.

1:21:13.410 --> 1:21:16.246
- Sro, this is ld.
- Go ahead, ld.

1:21:16.330 --> 1:21:19.500
Sro, is the t-minus sync
locked out at this time?

1:21:19.583 --> 1:21:23.379
That's affirmative, it is locked out
and we will bypass.

1:21:24.338 --> 1:21:27.299
- Minus four minutes and counting.
- Item one under four minutes.

1:21:27.383 --> 1:21:32.012
This is ald, manual hold initiated
at minus three minutes.

1:21:32.096 --> 1:21:34.056
We will hold at minus three minutes,

1:21:34.139 --> 1:21:37.059
waiting for the latest computation
on altitude-wind data.

1:21:41.397 --> 1:21:44.024
- Propulsion, this is ld on two.

launch control, Houston flight.
Ask rescue to prepare to copy.

1:22:19.393 --> 1:22:22.062
Ted, are you ready
to copy computer updates?

1:22:22.146 --> 1:22:24.815
Launch control, this is rescue,
go ahead.

1:22:24.898 --> 1:22:28.277

1:22:29.319 --> 1:22:33.323
Address: 6-1-3-5-6-7.

1:22:35.409 --> 1:22:38.203
Flight, this is rescue,
the computer's ready.

1:22:38.287 --> 1:22:39.663

1:22:42.332 --> 1:22:46.628
Pick it up on my Mark, ald.
Three, two, one, Mark.

1:22:47.463 --> 1:22:51.633
This is launch control
at t-minus two minutes and counting.

1:22:51.717 --> 1:22:54.970
In just 60 seconds,
we will start the count.

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:58.348
Launch pad runs completely
on internal power.

1:22:58.432 --> 1:23:01.268
This is launch control
coming up on t-minus...

1:23:01.351 --> 1:23:05.772
We're now beginning to feel
the real force of hurricane Alma,

1:23:05.856 --> 1:23:08.150
making it difficult to speak.

1:23:08.233 --> 1:23:10.360
-Go ahead.

1:23:10.444 --> 1:23:13.363
- You have a clear to launch.
- Rogen

1:23:13.447 --> 1:23:15.699
- ld, this is instrumentation.
- Go ahead.

1:23:15.782 --> 1:23:18.327
I verify item four under two minutes.

1:23:18.410 --> 1:23:21.747
Roger. Sro, start range recorders
and TV videotape recorders.

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:22.998
Wilco.

1:23:23.081 --> 1:23:24.625
- Ld, instrumentation.
- Go ahead.

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:27.377
Start and calibrate
all instrumentation recorders.

1:23:27.461 --> 1:23:29.004
Rogen

1:23:33.050 --> 1:23:36.845
minus 90 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:23:36.929 --> 1:23:40.557
- Second stage, fuel and oxidizing.
- Rogen

1:23:40.641 --> 1:23:44.686
- ld, this is instrumentation.
- Go ahead.

1:23:44.770 --> 1:23:48.398
Start following the instrumentation
calibration, ssb pre-fire.

1:23:48.482 --> 1:23:51.401
Instrumentation, pcm pre-fire.

1:23:51.485 --> 1:23:55.989
T-minus 70 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:24:08.919 --> 1:24:12.005
T-minus 60 seconds and counting.

1:24:13.423 --> 1:24:14.591
- Hold!
- Hold!

1:24:18.220 --> 1:24:19.805
Shut her down.

1:24:21.014 --> 1:24:23.850
Tower crew to launch pad,
move in, tower.

1:24:25.435 --> 1:24:30.482
The launch is scrubbed.
The launch is scrubbed.

1:24:34.152 --> 1:24:36.029
Houston, ironman.

1:24:38.490 --> 1:24:40.534
Houston, ironman, do you read?

1:24:45.163 --> 1:24:48.125
Goldstone, this is ironman,
do you read?

1:24:53.422 --> 1:24:55.757
Guaymas, ironman.

1:25:01.555 --> 1:25:03.473
Cape, this is ironman.

1:25:03.557 --> 1:25:06.435
Pruett, this is Keith.

1:25:06.518 --> 1:25:11.023
I'm sorry, we had to scrub the launch.

1:25:21.533 --> 1:25:25.662
I figured it might be like that,
we've been watching the storm.

1:25:27.414 --> 1:25:29.708
How close did you get?

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:32.169
T-minus 60 seconds.

1:25:32.252 --> 1:25:35.213
Now listen, Jim,
we're still working on that engine.

1:25:50.103 --> 1:25:51.605
Boss“.

1:25:52.606 --> 1:25:56.735
I just... I wanted to tell you...

1:25:57.444 --> 1:26:01.198
That you've done a great job,
all of you.

1:26:05.035 --> 1:26:08.622
We know that you've all worked
your tails off for us...

1:26:09.289 --> 1:26:14.211
And whatever happens to us,
you can't let it affect the program.

1:26:15.170 --> 1:26:17.047
You've done a great job, really...

1:26:17.130 --> 1:26:21.968
And, you know, whatever it is that's
hanging us up, it's nobody's fault.

1:26:23.637 --> 1:26:26.014
Gbi reports loss of signal.

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:30.686
Ascension will acquire the spacecraft,
shall we remote you through?

1:26:31.895 --> 1:26:33.146
Nope.

1:26:33.230 --> 1:26:35.565
Move in, white room.
Get the pilot out of there.

1:26:35.649 --> 1:26:37.317
- Ted.
- Wait.

1:26:37.401 --> 1:26:40.904
- I want to speak to Keith.
- I'm here, Ted.

1:26:40.987 --> 1:26:45.075
We've done everything
we possibly could. We cannot launch.

1:26:45.158 --> 1:26:49.079
I'm telling you to launch! You get
this haywagon off the ground!

1:26:49.162 --> 1:26:52.374
Now launch, damn it, Keith,
launch this thing!

1:26:52.999 --> 1:26:54.584
Keith!

1:26:54.668 --> 1:26:55.836
Keith!

1:27:15.564 --> 1:27:17.858
I have a brief statement.

1:27:18.442 --> 1:27:22.195
The launch of the xrv rescue craft

1:27:22.279 --> 1:27:27.617
was scrubbed at 8:47, cape time.

1:27:27.701 --> 1:27:30.912
The pad was shut down
at t-minus 58 seconds

1:27:30.996 --> 1:27:35.208
when the wind velocity
in the launch area Rose to 48 knots.

1:27:36.710 --> 1:27:41.715
Commander pruett in the Apollo
command module has been informed.

1:27:49.723 --> 1:27:54.728
This was a very fine, fine effort.

1:27:55.854 --> 1:27:57.481
Do you have any questions?

1:27:57.564 --> 1:28:00.817
Mr. Keith, you say that
the launch has been scrubbed.

1:28:00.901 --> 1:28:03.612
Are you going to reschedule
at a later time?

1:28:03.695 --> 1:28:04.695
We have no plans.

1:28:04.738 --> 1:28:07.908
- Any future rescue attempts?
- We have no plans.

1:28:07.991 --> 1:28:12.078
Mr. Keith, you say the men have
been informed. Who informed them?

1:28:13.663 --> 1:28:16.166
What was their reaction?

1:28:19.586 --> 1:28:21.671
Do you have any other questions?

1:28:21.755 --> 1:28:27.511
There's an assumption that the space
program will be brought to a halt

1:28:27.594 --> 1:28:29.679
for an investigation
of the accident...

1:28:29.763 --> 1:28:33.809
Plus a general examination
of our purposes in space

1:28:33.892 --> 1:28:37.187
and the morality of putting men
into space without adequate...

1:28:37.270 --> 1:28:38.772
What's your question?

1:28:39.689 --> 1:28:42.567
Are the results you gained
worth the lives you lost?

1:28:42.651 --> 1:28:44.694
You're damn right they are!

1:28:44.778 --> 1:28:49.115
Know what they accomplished living
up there in a tin can for five months?

1:28:50.033 --> 1:28:54.496
Because of men like these, we've taken
the first step off this little planet.

1:28:54.579 --> 1:28:56.540
The moon trip was a walk
around the block.

1:28:56.623 --> 1:29:01.169
We're going to the stars,
to other worlds, other civilizations.

1:29:01.253 --> 1:29:03.088
Mr. Keith?

1:29:04.297 --> 1:29:08.510
Men will be killed in this effort just as
they're killed in cars and airplanes...

1:29:08.593 --> 1:29:10.053
And bars and... what is it?

1:29:10.136 --> 1:29:12.305
- Look at the numbers.
- What about them?

1:29:12.389 --> 1:29:15.016
The numbers, Mr. Keith, the numbers!

1:29:18.687 --> 1:29:21.523
- In god's name...
- What is that?

1:29:32.784 --> 1:29:35.161
In this disturbance,
we have 90-knot winds.

1:29:35.245 --> 1:29:37.581
In the center, or eye,
we have zero.

1:29:37.664 --> 1:29:39.916
The eye of the hurricane
will pass over the cape.

1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:45.755
All I wish to hear from each of you
is yes or no. Go or no go.

1:29:45.839 --> 1:29:48.758
Do we have a launch window
while the eye's over the cape?

1:29:48.842 --> 1:29:51.761
We affirm a launch window
at 2231:06.

1:29:51.845 --> 1:29:53.847
Can you launch your rocket
through the eye?

1:29:53.930 --> 1:29:56.016
- Yes, sir.
- Will the bird fly?

1:29:56.099 --> 1:29:58.643
Well, it's been kicked around
by 80-knot winds.

1:29:58.727 --> 1:30:00.604
- The data's...
- What's your judgment?

1:30:00.687 --> 1:30:01.771
It'll fly.

1:30:01.855 --> 1:30:02.939
- Carp?
- Yes, sir?

1:30:03.023 --> 1:30:06.443
- Do we have 16 minutes in the eye?
- No, sir, not 16.

1:30:06.526 --> 1:30:07.652
Do we have 14?

1:30:07.736 --> 1:30:10.280
We've been trying to get a chart
from the computer...

1:30:10.363 --> 1:30:11.823
What's your judgment?

1:30:11.907 --> 1:30:13.783
I'll buy 14.

1:30:13.867 --> 1:30:16.161
Can we move the tower back
in 12 minutes?

1:30:16.244 --> 1:30:18.288
You give the order and we'll do it.

1:30:18.872 --> 1:30:20.790
Houston, flight.

1:30:20.874 --> 1:30:23.460
Is the rescue craft go
for point Charlie?

1:30:23.543 --> 1:30:26.796
We can have point Charlie,
but then pilot will be on his own.

1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:30.800
Rescue, can you rendezvous without
an on board computer program?

1:30:30.884 --> 1:30:32.677
You just get me in the ballpark.

1:30:33.845 --> 1:30:38.808
Then we are go for launch
at 2231:06 local time.

1:30:38.892 --> 1:30:43.188
Roger, 2231:06 local time.

1:30:43.271 --> 1:30:47.734
Roger, 2231:06 local time.

1:30:47.817 --> 1:30:50.987
We'll recycle to t-minus 30.

1:30:54.908 --> 1:30:59.829
You know, of course, that by
2231:06, the crew will be dead.

1:30:59.913 --> 1:31:02.916
There's not enough oxygen left
for three men to live that long.

1:31:03.917 --> 1:31:06.670
What about two men?

1:31:06.753 --> 1:31:10.090
We don't figure that way, we plot
total pressure against total use.

1:31:10.173 --> 1:31:13.426
Is there sufficient oxygen
for two men?

1:31:15.095 --> 1:31:17.180
For one?

1:31:21.017 --> 1:31:23.019
Two might just make it.

1:31:48.420 --> 1:31:50.672
- Go!
- Move back service tower.

1:31:58.972 --> 1:32:01.766
This is launch control,
we have just resumed the count.

1:32:01.850 --> 1:32:03.393
Col. Dougherty has confirmed

1:32:03.476 --> 1:32:06.187
that all spacecraft systems
are go at this time.

1:32:06.271 --> 1:32:10.066
Launch director is about to feed the
computer update to the spacecraft.

1:32:11.443 --> 1:32:16.823
This is an unbelievable scene.
No wind, absolute silence.

1:32:16.906 --> 1:32:18.908
Overhead...

1:32:18.992 --> 1:32:21.911
Nothing but black night
and brilliant stars

1:32:21.995 --> 1:32:26.291
as the eye of the hurricane Alma
passes directly over us.

1:32:26.374 --> 1:32:29.419
There's an eerie hush
over everything here.

1:32:29.502 --> 1:32:31.921
No rain, no wind.

1:32:32.005 --> 1:32:36.926
The lives of three men are measured
by their fading heartbeats...

1:32:37.010 --> 1:32:39.429
And here on pad 41
at cape Kennedy

1:32:39.512 --> 1:32:41.765
we're in the middle
of another heartbeat.

1:32:41.848 --> 1:32:45.226
It's a single moment in the life
of a great storm...

1:32:45.310 --> 1:32:48.480
Reprieve, we hope,
for pruett, Lloyd and stone.

1:32:49.981 --> 1:32:52.734
The service tower is
rolling away from the launch pad.

1:32:52.817 --> 1:32:55.945
As soon as it's 800 feet away
it'll be locked into position

1:32:56.029 --> 1:32:58.031
but they'll launch
before that happens.

1:32:58.531 --> 1:33:00.784
That tower is expendable...

1:33:00.867 --> 1:33:05.955
But the three men
in ironman one are not.

1:33:06.039 --> 1:33:08.041
-Go ahead.

1:33:08.124 --> 1:33:10.293
- You have a clear to launch.
- Rogen

1:33:10.376 --> 1:33:12.462
- ld, this is instrumentation.
- Go ahead.

1:33:12.545 --> 1:33:14.839
Verify item four under two minutes.

1:33:14.923 --> 1:33:18.051
Roger. Sro, start range recorders
and TV videotape recorders.

1:33:18.134 --> 1:33:19.344
Wilco.

1:33:19.427 --> 1:33:23.640
T-minus 70 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:33:24.349 --> 1:33:26.434
- Ld, instrumentation.
- Go ahead.

1:33:26.518 --> 1:33:29.687
Start and calibrate
all instrumentation recorders.

1:33:30.230 --> 1:33:33.983
T-minus 60 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:33:35.068 --> 1:33:36.861
- Start instrument recorders.
- Go.

1:33:36.945 --> 1:33:38.905
- Srm pressure sensor squibs.
- Go.

1:33:38.988 --> 1:33:40.782
- Pyro sequence started.
- Rogen

1:33:40.865 --> 1:33:45.078
t-minus 50 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:33:45.912 --> 1:33:48.998
- Xrv is go on internal.
- Roger, all systems on internal.

1:33:49.082 --> 1:33:51.543
- Enable srm regulators.
- Go.

1:33:51.626 --> 1:33:55.713
T-minus 40 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:33:55.797 --> 1:33:58.049
- Transfer tvc power.
- Go.

1:33:58.133 --> 1:34:02.679
T-minus 30 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:34:02.762 --> 1:34:05.515
- Pyro-initiators to on.
- Go.

1:34:06.933 --> 1:34:08.226
- Launch panel to on.
- Go.

1:34:08.309 --> 1:34:10.603
- Release control to on.
- Go.

1:34:10.687 --> 1:34:13.815
T-minus 20 seconds
and counting, Mark.

1:34:13.898 --> 1:34:15.984
Stand by for a terminal count.

1:34:22.115 --> 1:34:26.035
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

1:34:26.119 --> 1:34:32.125
- Five, four, three, two, one.
- I have ignition.

1:34:48.141 --> 1:34:51.853
- Go! Go!
- All right, go, go!

1:35:26.471 --> 1:35:29.349
- Roll programmed.
- Roger the roll.

1:35:30.183 --> 1:35:31.601
Pitch programmed.

1:35:31.684 --> 1:35:35.188
- Roger the pitch.
- Mark, 50 seconds.

1:35:36.189 --> 1:35:40.109
Cabin pressure holding fine, .57.

1:35:40.193 --> 1:35:41.694
Mark one plus 40.

1:35:41.778 --> 1:35:44.155
Pcs update in.

1:35:44.239 --> 1:35:45.740
You look good here.

1:35:45.823 --> 1:35:47.533
Go for staging.

1:35:47.617 --> 1:35:50.119
Roger, Ted,
you are go for staging.

1:35:50.203 --> 1:35:55.124
Rescue, this is flight,
fido confirms orbit insertion at 8:20.

1:35:55.208 --> 1:35:56.209
Rogen

1:35:56.292 --> 1:35:58.127
my initial rendezvous parameters

1:35:58.211 --> 1:36:02.131
indicate delta v
of 263 feet per second.

1:36:02.215 --> 1:36:05.134
Timer burn t plus 12, plus 15.

1:36:05.218 --> 1:36:09.222
- Have fido confirm my numbers.
- Roger, stand by.

1:36:23.903 --> 1:36:27.156
Rescue, flight. We show you right
on the money. Go get them, kid.

1:36:28.241 --> 1:36:32.036
Cause of death will be anoxia.

1:36:36.124 --> 1:36:38.751
You know, that's
an interesting way to go.

1:36:39.502 --> 1:36:42.171
The brain gets starved for oxygen.

1:36:42.255 --> 1:36:46.259
Ironman one, this is the cape.
Do you read?

1:36:47.468 --> 1:36:52.974
Just before the end you feel great
and then you laugh it up.

1:36:55.059 --> 1:36:59.230
When you're ready
to start singing and shouting...

1:37:01.482 --> 1:37:03.192
Blackout.

1:37:03.276 --> 1:37:07.405
Ironman one, this is the cape.
Do you read?

1:37:10.825 --> 1:37:13.828
You know, that's
an interesting mechanism.

1:37:13.911 --> 1:37:16.914
There's not much data on that either.

1:37:20.293 --> 1:37:23.796
Ironman one, this is carnarva.
Do you read?

1:37:25.673 --> 1:37:28.551
Ironman one, redstone,
do you copy?

1:37:31.888 --> 1:37:35.641
Ironman one, Houston Capcom,
do you read?

1:37:36.267 --> 1:37:39.687
Ironman one, Houston Capcom,
do you read?

1:37:41.064 --> 1:37:45.193
Ironman one, this is Houston flight,
do you read me?

1:37:46.361 --> 1:37:49.280
Ironman, this is Keith.

1:37:50.990 --> 1:37:53.201
What the hell do they want?

1:37:56.287 --> 1:37:58.247
Hello, Jim, I want to talk to you.

1:37:58.331 --> 1:37:59.874
Yeah, what do you want?

1:37:59.957 --> 1:38:02.043
I have some numbers for you.

1:38:02.126 --> 1:38:06.923
The eye of the hurricane
passed over the cape at 2218

1:38:07.006 --> 1:38:12.345
and we had a second window
at 2231:06, cape time.

1:38:12.428 --> 1:38:16.182
We've successfully launched
the rescue craft through the eye,

1:38:16.265 --> 1:38:18.059
do you understand?

1:38:19.769 --> 1:38:21.979
You have launched the xrv?

1:38:22.063 --> 1:38:24.982
Yes, that's correct, the xrv
has completed staging

1:38:25.066 --> 1:38:27.527
and is on its way to rendezvous.

1:38:27.610 --> 1:38:31.030
Our transfer will be at 2328.

1:38:31.114 --> 1:38:34.742
That's 55 minutes from now,
do you read?

1:38:34.826 --> 1:38:36.411
Yeah, I read.

1:38:40.790 --> 1:38:47.296
Jim, how do you evaluate
the oxygen situation?

1:38:50.216 --> 1:38:54.095
Well, we have whatever oxygen's
left in the spacecraft system...

1:38:54.178 --> 1:38:58.182
And there are only two bottles
of emergency oxygen on board,

1:38:58.266 --> 1:39:01.436
five minutes each,
that's 10 man-minutes.

1:39:03.396 --> 1:39:07.692
My backpack
and Lloyd's and stone's...

1:39:07.775 --> 1:39:10.820
But there's not much oxygen
left in them.

1:39:10.903 --> 1:39:13.573
Well, you'll have to save your
backpacks for the Eva transfer.

1:39:13.656 --> 1:39:15.408
Yeah, I know that.

1:39:17.410 --> 1:39:18.828
Fifty-five minutes.

1:39:24.333 --> 1:39:25.710
We'll be dead by then.

1:39:25.793 --> 1:39:32.133
Well, only if you continue
to use oxygen at the present rate.

1:39:32.216 --> 1:39:35.470
Well, we can't cut down.

1:39:35.553 --> 1:39:37.722
Let's think about that.

1:39:39.432 --> 1:39:43.394
You want us to lower
the partial pressure again?

1:39:43.478 --> 1:39:46.272
No, we've examined that.
It won't work.

1:39:49.442 --> 1:39:52.653
Well, we're lying here
like corpses now.

1:39:52.737 --> 1:39:54.155
What else can we do?

1:39:55.573 --> 1:39:57.909
You must think.

1:40:06.125 --> 1:40:07.960
Yeah, we're thinking.

1:40:12.507 --> 1:40:15.301
Are we talking about the same thing?

1:40:20.139 --> 1:40:23.392
Why don't you talk it over?

1:40:23.476 --> 1:40:26.395
If you could work out something,
it would be a great help.

1:40:26.479 --> 1:40:28.397
Yeah, we'll talk it over.

1:40:28.481 --> 1:40:32.401
I must point out that any effective
action must be taken immediately.

1:40:32.485 --> 1:40:34.737
Look, don't tell me what to do!

1:40:34.820 --> 1:40:37.490
We've been taking your damned
orders and where the hell are we?!

1:40:37.573 --> 1:40:40.493
From now on we're gonna
make all of the decisions!

1:40:40.993 --> 1:40:42.578
Whatever we do, you're out of it!

1:40:43.621 --> 1:40:46.374
I appreciate what you're saying, Jim...

1:40:46.457 --> 1:40:49.293
And I agree with you,
you're exactly right.

1:40:49.961 --> 1:40:52.171
Yeah, anything else?

1:40:52.838 --> 1:40:55.341
No, that's all at the moment.

1:40:57.343 --> 1:41:01.055
Would you please give me
those launch numbers again?

1:41:01.138 --> 1:41:06.060
Yes, that's launch
at 2231:06, cape time...

1:41:06.143 --> 1:41:09.438
Rendezvous and transfer at 2328.

1:41:10.523 --> 1:41:12.191
Thanks.

1:41:28.207 --> 1:41:33.879
Launch at 2231:06,
rendezvous 2328.

1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:38.634
- That's what they say.
- Fifty-five minutes to go.

1:41:40.303 --> 1:41:42.513
Through the eye of a hurricane.

1:41:42.597 --> 1:41:44.890
Jesus, 55 minutes.

1:41:46.058 --> 1:41:48.769
- Right.
- We'll be pretty cold by then.

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:02.241
One of us is gonna have to go.

1:42:03.743 --> 1:42:05.578
I mean...

1:42:07.163 --> 1:42:09.457
That's what we're talking about,
isn't it?

1:42:10.416 --> 1:42:13.586
One of us goes and the other two stay.

1:42:20.593 --> 1:42:22.595
What are we gonna do?

1:42:25.431 --> 1:42:27.099
Look, let's do it scientifically.

1:42:27.183 --> 1:42:30.227
Two big guys throw
the little guy out, okay?

1:42:30.311 --> 1:42:32.688
Yeah, well that's an idea.

1:42:40.696 --> 1:42:44.784
We're gonna have to talk about this.
So, what are we gonna do?

1:42:48.621 --> 1:42:50.831
I could do it by chance.

1:42:53.125 --> 1:42:55.461
I'll tear out strips from a pad.

1:42:55.544 --> 1:42:58.547
One short, two long.
The guy with the short end goes.

1:43:02.426 --> 1:43:04.512
Oh, Jesus, we can't do that.

1:43:05.638 --> 1:43:07.640
No, we can't do that.

1:43:09.183 --> 1:43:12.436
Well look, I don't want
to just lay here and die.

1:43:12.978 --> 1:43:14.772
All right, then figure the odds.

1:43:14.855 --> 1:43:17.608
Two guys, three guys,
is that much difference?

1:43:17.692 --> 1:43:19.568
I say double the pills.

1:43:19.652 --> 1:43:22.571
No moving, no talking,
pulse way down.

1:43:22.655 --> 1:43:26.784
Even when there's no pressure there's
oxygen molecules floating around.

1:43:27.451 --> 1:43:30.705
You live for a while even when
there's no pressure in the gauges.

1:43:32.248 --> 1:43:35.167
For god's sake,
it's less than 55 minutes!

1:43:35.668 --> 1:43:38.671
- You're dreaming, stone.
- All right, okay.

1:43:43.175 --> 1:43:44.677
I'll go.

1:43:46.220 --> 1:43:49.598
I'm the weakest, I'm using up
the most oxygen, I'll go.

1:43:49.682 --> 1:43:51.225
It's all right.

1:43:51.976 --> 1:43:54.019
All right, all right.

1:43:59.108 --> 1:44:00.693
All right, get your helmets on.

1:44:02.987 --> 1:44:05.030
I'm going out to fix the engine.

1:44:05.114 --> 1:44:08.242
Are you kidding?
You can't fix that engine.

1:44:08.325 --> 1:44:09.952
What the hell do you know about it?

1:44:15.416 --> 1:44:17.460
I don't know why I let them
talk me out of it.

1:44:17.543 --> 1:44:19.420
I should've done this two days ago.

1:44:22.089 --> 1:44:24.550
Come on, get your helmets on.

1:46:03.357 --> 1:46:05.568
He'll fix it.

1:46:05.651 --> 1:46:08.654
He's good, he'll fix it.

1:46:08.737 --> 1:46:12.283
You son of a bitch. You know
what he's doing up there.

1:46:18.122 --> 1:46:19.748
- Buzz, don't!
- Jim!

1:46:19.832 --> 1:46:22.835
- Get back in here.
- Jim, don't do it!

1:46:24.753 --> 1:46:27.172
You're going to rip out the umbilicals.

1:46:27.256 --> 1:46:29.842
Jim, don't do it. Jim!

1:46:30.968 --> 1:46:32.845
Jim.

1:46:33.470 --> 1:46:36.849
Jim, don't do it. Jim!

1:46:44.857 --> 1:46:48.402
Stoney. Stoney,
give me some line here.

1:46:48.485 --> 1:46:51.113
- Stoney?
- We can't get to him.

1:48:49.982 --> 1:48:50.983
Yes?

1:48:51.817 --> 1:48:55.112
Mrs. Pruett, I wanted to talk to you.

1:48:57.531 --> 1:48:59.950
Your husband is dead.

1:49:05.706 --> 1:49:09.001
It was an accident.

1:49:10.002 --> 1:49:13.505
He was trying to repair the spacecraft.

1:49:21.013 --> 1:49:23.432
I'm sorry.

1:49:50.292 --> 1:49:52.503
I told you, Jim's not here.

1:49:53.045 --> 1:49:55.005
He had an accident.

1:49:55.923 --> 1:49:58.258
Where's stoney at?

1:49:58.342 --> 1:50:00.135
I'm here.

1:50:02.096 --> 1:50:03.972
Stoney?

1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:06.892
Dougherty's coming.

1:50:13.607 --> 1:50:18.112
Stoney, tell Jim to get us out of here.

1:50:18.195 --> 1:50:21.782
Stop eating your oxygen,
damn you!

1:50:21.865 --> 1:50:23.659
Be still!

1:50:27.079 --> 1:50:30.374
Range 76.8.

1:50:31.875 --> 1:50:34.419
I've got to hit it.
I'm a little under the line.

1:50:34.503 --> 1:50:37.005
Rescue, flight.
Do you confirm burn attitude?

1:50:37.089 --> 1:50:42.427
- Roger, attitude is go, delta v 63.
- Roger, Ted, this is the one.

1:50:42.511 --> 1:50:46.098
Roger, three, two, one.

1:50:50.144 --> 1:50:52.020
Oxygen.

1:50:52.104 --> 1:50:56.150
Can't. Can't, gotta save it
for the transfer.

1:50:59.570 --> 1:51:01.530
I'm dying.

1:51:02.114 --> 1:51:05.868
- I'm dying.
- No, you're not dying.

1:51:07.202 --> 1:51:10.038
It takes a long time to die.

1:51:10.122 --> 1:51:12.833
Ironman, this is rescue.

1:51:13.750 --> 1:51:15.919
Ironman, this is rescue.

1:51:17.129 --> 1:51:21.133
- Read you.
- Turn on your acquisition lights.

1:51:23.135 --> 1:51:24.303
Say again?

1:51:24.386 --> 1:51:27.139
Come on, stoney,
turn on your acquisition lights.

1:51:28.473 --> 1:51:32.853
Roger. Roger, acquisition lights.

1:51:40.485 --> 1:51:45.240
Okay, stoney, I'm coming right down
the pipe. I'll see you in six minutes.

1:51:45.324 --> 1:51:46.867
Six minutes, Roger.

1:51:47.659 --> 1:51:52.873
Buzz, six more minutes.
Only six more minutes, buzz.

1:51:55.250 --> 1:51:59.504
- I can't.
- You can, buzz. You've got to.

1:51:59.588 --> 1:52:02.507
- I can't.
- You can, buzz. Think of something.

1:52:02.591 --> 1:52:04.218
Think of...

1:52:06.178 --> 1:52:07.429
Think of the earth, buzz.

1:52:09.473 --> 1:52:11.433
Look at the earth, buzz.

1:52:11.934 --> 1:52:14.061
Look, can you...?

1:52:14.144 --> 1:52:16.271
Can you tell where we are?

1:52:17.189 --> 1:52:19.107
Stoney?

1:52:21.193 --> 1:52:23.195
All right, buzz.

1:52:25.197 --> 1:52:27.199
All right.

1:52:45.217 --> 1:52:49.721
All right, buzz,
you're on my air now.

1:52:49.805 --> 1:52:53.558
Take a breather.
I'm going back on cabin air.

1:52:53.642 --> 1:52:55.227
There must be some left.

1:53:28.719 --> 1:53:31.430
Ironman, this is Keith.

1:53:32.764 --> 1:53:35.851
Ironman, this is Keith,
do you read me?

1:53:35.934 --> 1:53:37.728
Purpose...

1:53:38.562 --> 1:53:40.605
And objective.

1:53:40.689 --> 1:53:44.526
Ironman one,
this is Keith, do you read?

1:53:47.279 --> 1:53:49.197
Purpose...

1:53:49.281 --> 1:53:51.533
And objective.

1:53:52.284 --> 1:53:55.329
Ironman, this is Keith,
do you read me?

1:54:02.294 --> 1:54:04.379
Purpose:

1:54:07.299 --> 1:54:11.553
The acquisition of...

1:54:13.221 --> 1:54:16.224
Ironman, do you read me?

1:54:18.310 --> 1:54:20.228
No.

1:54:20.312 --> 1:54:23.231
Oh, god.

1:54:23.315 --> 1:54:25.317
Oh, god.

1:54:26.234 --> 1:54:30.113
How beautiful.

1:54:36.828 --> 1:54:39.956
I'm beginning to see...

1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:41.625
Visions...

1:54:41.708 --> 1:54:44.378
Stoney, come in.

1:54:55.305 --> 1:54:57.391
There you are.

1:55:03.355 --> 1:55:06.274
Ironman, this is Keith.

1:55:06.358 --> 1:55:11.279
Ironman, a Russian spacecraft
is making rendezvous with you.

1:55:11.363 --> 1:55:15.784
Do you see
a Russian spacecraft? Come in.

1:55:16.701 --> 1:55:20.789
Stoney, do you see
a Russian spacecraft?

1:55:21.665 --> 1:55:23.291
I see him.

1:55:24.209 --> 1:55:29.047
Good. Now 30 minutes ago
he made a change in orbit.

1:55:29.131 --> 1:55:32.592
He is moving towards you
for rendezvous.

1:55:32.676 --> 1:55:34.386
We don't know what he's going to do.

1:55:35.429 --> 1:55:38.223
All you can do at this point
is watch him.

1:55:38.306 --> 1:55:41.059
Watch him. Stoney, do you read me?

1:55:42.769 --> 1:55:44.396
He...

1:55:45.147 --> 1:55:47.732
He's stopping.

1:56:01.037 --> 1:56:03.415
He's opening up.

1:56:04.416 --> 1:56:08.044
He's coming out.

1:56:22.100 --> 1:56:25.395
He wants me to do something.

1:56:35.447 --> 1:56:40.076
I think he wants me
to open the hatch.

1:56:40.994 --> 1:56:44.372
Stoney, what is your oxygen readout?

1:56:44.456 --> 1:56:46.875
Your oxygen readout?

1:56:47.834 --> 1:56:50.295
Oh, it's zero-zero.

1:56:50.378 --> 1:56:53.965
No, no. No, that...

1:56:54.049 --> 1:56:56.760
That can't be right. I'm...

1:56:59.721 --> 1:57:01.556
I'm breathing something.

1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:06.102
Now, stoney, listen to me. I want you
to follow through with the Russian.

1:57:06.186 --> 1:57:07.938
Don't wait for dougherty.

1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:11.066
- Is dougherty here?
- Dougherty is not there.

1:57:11.149 --> 1:57:15.820
The Russian is there.
He wants you to open your hatch.

1:57:15.904 --> 1:57:18.490
Oh, god, I'm tired, Charles.

1:57:19.157 --> 1:57:22.869
- I'm tired.
- Stoney, put on your helmet.

1:57:22.953 --> 1:57:25.121
Open the hatch.

1:57:25.205 --> 1:57:26.498
Open the hatch.

1:57:27.916 --> 1:57:29.501
Open...

1:57:30.919 --> 1:57:33.129
All right.

1:57:33.213 --> 1:57:36.591
- Blow hatch.
- Negative, do not blow the hatch.

1:57:36.675 --> 1:57:39.803
Open it with the lever,
the unlocking lever.

1:57:39.886 --> 1:57:41.721
Do you read me, stoney?

1:57:51.314 --> 1:57:53.024
Stoney?

1:58:45.744 --> 1:58:48.747
Flight, this is rescue,
I've got their light.

1:58:48.830 --> 1:58:51.416
Roger, Ted, you've got
their acq lights.

1:58:54.502 --> 1:58:55.587
Blow hatch.

1:59:00.592 --> 1:59:05.597
- Blow the hatch.
- Do not. Do not blow the hatch!

1:59:11.561 --> 1:59:13.647
Hatch blown.

1:59:53.103 --> 1:59:55.647
He can't get any closer, buzz.

1:59:56.940 --> 1:59:59.442
We have to go to him.

2:01:24.444 --> 2:01:28.114
I've got visual on them now.
I'm gonna brake down to 10.

2:01:28.198 --> 2:01:31.826
They're about 50 feet apart.
The Apollo hatch is open.

2:01:31.910 --> 2:01:35.205
- Can you see the crew?
- Negafive.

2:01:35.288 --> 2:01:37.415
I'm gonna go in a little closer.

2:02:10.949 --> 2:02:14.077
There's a light flashing
from the Russian ship.

2:02:32.262 --> 2:02:37.058
Some guy's floating about 150 feet
below me. I'm going after him.

2:04:56.948 --> 2:05:00.368
Ironman, this is Keith,
do you read me?

2:05:05.206 --> 2:05:07.458
Come in, ironman.

2:05:24.350 --> 2:05:27.979
Ironman, this is Keith, come in.

2:06:05.099 --> 2:06:09.020
Ironman one,
this is Keith, do you read?

2:06:33.711 --> 2:06:37.048
Ironman, this is Keith,
do you read me?

2:06:50.228 --> 2:06:52.980
Ironman, do you read me?

2:06:53.064 --> 2:06:54.816
Keith, this is rescue.

2:06:54.899 --> 2:06:57.485
I'm in the Apollo.
The Russian got air to stoney

2:06:57.568 --> 2:07:00.071
and I've transferred him
to my oxygen.

2:07:01.405 --> 2:07:03.366
He's all right, he's breathing.

2:07:04.075 --> 2:07:06.244
And I've got Lloyd.

2:07:34.105 --> 2:07:38.359
Ted, get back to the xrv
and prepare for re-entry.

2:07:38.442 --> 2:07:41.028
Roger, I'm on my way.

2:07:57.128 --> 2:08:00.923
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

2:08:01.007 --> 2:08:07.096
Six, five, four, three, two, one.
