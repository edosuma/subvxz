00:05.200 --> 00:09.050
Hello, I'm Princess Di
and I'd like to buy a flat.

00:09.070 --> 00:10.220
What type of flat do you want?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.169
I'd like a flat
that is close to my work,

00:13.189 --> 00:16.039
because I work
in a playground slide shop.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.190
Take a look, I think we have
one.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.070
Do you like the kitchen?

00:21.089 --> 00:23.050
Wow! I love the kitchen.

00:23.070 --> 00:24.070
It's awesome.

00:24.089 --> 00:26.089
Now the couch and the living
room.

00:27.120 --> 00:30.059
Hey! The couch is gorgeous, I
love it.

00:30.079 --> 00:33.039
Look, the double bed is
upstairs.

00:33.060 --> 00:35.009
And a bunk bed here, right?

00:35.030 --> 00:36.070
Yes. Do you like it?

00:36.090 --> 00:39.039
Yes, my husband and me
plan to have two children

00:39.060 --> 00:41.159
who'll be called
Federico and Carolina.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.020
I'll take it.
I'm going to buy the flat.

00:44.079 --> 00:45.210
Who will pay for it?

00:46.070 --> 00:48.039
My husband and me will pay for
it.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.049
With a mortgage.

00:50.070 --> 00:51.100
Really?

00:51.119 --> 00:52.100
Yes.

00:54.030 --> 00:57.119
The interest rate is 2.5%
over twelve months

00:57.140 --> 00:59.079
starting from the date
of the last payment.

00:59.189 --> 01:03.210
Then the Euribor rate
will be variable, increasing by
0.5.

01:03.229 --> 01:07.140
Final payment: 24 August, 2043.

01:09.079 --> 01:10.109
Perfect.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.189
That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:12.210 --> 01:15.010
Now we all know exactly
what we're signing.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.079
Ms. Aguado.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.200
Oh, a black biro.

01:23.189 --> 01:25.170
Do you have another colour?

01:25.189 --> 01:28.189
- It's fine, you can sign in
black.
- Yes, I know that.

01:28.210 --> 01:32.000
But it doesn't stand out, I'd
rather
a different colour from the
text.

01:32.129 --> 01:33.180
Isn't there one here?

01:34.009 --> 01:35.049
I have one.

01:35.109 --> 01:37.099
- It's green.
- Okay. Great.

01:39.039 --> 01:39.159
Thanks.

01:41.109 --> 01:44.069
- I sign each page, right?
- Yes.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.210
When is the wedding?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.170
Soon.

01:50.189 --> 01:52.009
21 May.

01:56.009 --> 01:57.060
Done.

01:58.090 --> 01:59.229
- Your turn.
- My turn.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.060
Are you all right?

02:11.219 --> 02:13.039
Want another biro?

02:13.060 --> 02:16.210
Why couldn't you sign
with the biro the notary gave
you?

02:17.030 --> 02:19.090
It's the same colour
as the printed word.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.090
You always do the same thing.

02:21.110 --> 02:24.000
In a restaurant
we have to change tables three
times

02:24.020 --> 02:25.090
because you don't like the
lighting.

02:25.110 --> 02:28.219
In a hotel you ask for a room
exactly the same as on the
website.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.009
You're never satisfied with
anything.

02:37.170 --> 02:39.229
- Is this because of the enema?
- No!

02:40.009 --> 02:42.129
- No, please don't bring it up.
- But that's why.

02:42.150 --> 02:44.000
- It isn't.
- Excuse me...

02:44.020 --> 02:46.159
We'll give you some time alone
so you can discuss it.

02:46.180 --> 02:48.150
- But we're coming back?
- Yes.

02:53.009 --> 02:55.210
This has nothing to do with the
enema,
okay?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.090
Yes it does.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.129
- No.
- Yes.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.090
- I said no!
- It is, it's fine.

03:00.110 --> 03:03.080
We haven't had sex since,
that was three months ago.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.110
You made me give you one
like a nurse.

03:05.129 --> 03:07.110
I said I wouldn't do it without
one.

03:07.129 --> 03:10.180
Maybe we could be a bit more
spontaneous and do it without
one.

03:10.199 --> 03:13.180
- Then clean poo off the sheet?
- Yes, I'd rather that!

03:13.199 --> 03:15.009
Stop shouting!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.210
You're just so inflexible.

03:17.229 --> 03:22.060
The world's most inflexible
person.
And I can't take it anymore.

03:29.199 --> 03:30.210
María.

03:31.050 --> 03:32.060
María.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.090
You can come in.

03:35.039 --> 03:36.069
All right?

03:37.069 --> 03:39.039
- Sorted it out?
- We have a question.

03:39.060 --> 03:41.060
If you guys were about
to have anal sex...

03:41.079 --> 03:42.090
- No.
- What would you prefer?

03:42.110 --> 03:44.110
That your partner had an enema,

03:44.129 --> 03:47.229
or got carried away by passion
and cleaned poo off the sheet
later?

03:48.009 --> 03:49.030
No need to answer.

03:49.050 --> 03:50.020
It's fine.

03:50.039 --> 03:51.229
I need to know
if you're going to sign or not.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.159
I'm sorry, María.

03:57.180 --> 04:01.069
I can't sign a 30-year mortgage
with you. I just can't.

04:02.090 --> 04:04.090
It isn't for 30 years.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.080
It's for 25.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.000
They just read it to us.

04:11.069 --> 04:13.080
I have to get out of here.
I have to go.

04:13.099 --> 04:14.180
Really?

04:15.090 --> 04:16.100
Sorry.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.069
Sorry.

04:31.220 --> 04:35.009
We can't get the down payment
back,
can we?

04:35.029 --> 04:37.060
May I have the biro back,
please?

04:37.079 --> 04:39.100
PERFECT LIFE

04:41.000 --> 04:42.019
Thank you.

04:43.009 --> 04:46.100
WHEN YOU DON'T LET YOURSELF GO

04:48.000 --> 04:50.139
Listen, I didn't take the pill
last night.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.159
- Do I take it twice?
- Absolutely not.

04:52.180 --> 04:55.079
Are you sure?
I won't get pregnant?

05:03.019 --> 05:04.170
- Honey.
- Where are you?

05:04.189 --> 05:06.209
Just leaving the meeting now.

05:06.230 --> 05:10.009
- Hurry, today's the day.
- I'll be there in 20, okay?

05:10.029 --> 05:11.069
Ciao, ciao.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.000
I love you!

05:16.019 --> 05:16.230
I love you!

05:17.079 --> 05:19.079
I love you! I love you!

05:19.180 --> 05:20.129
Give me a hug!

05:20.220 --> 05:22.050
Give me a hug!

06:10.209 --> 06:12.009
Shit.
Sorry, man.

06:12.029 --> 06:14.160
- Did I wake you up?
- No, no.

06:15.060 --> 06:17.029
- You sure?
- It's fine.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.089
- How are you?
- Good.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.209
- What time is it?
- Ten.

06:21.149 --> 06:24.129
Fancy grabbing some breakfast
together?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.220
Didn't you have to get up early
to paint?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.149
Yeah, I've finished.

06:29.170 --> 06:33.129
I wanted to take a little break
before going to work, you know?

06:35.180 --> 06:37.110
And what do you do?

06:38.199 --> 06:40.209
- I work in a museum.
- Really?

06:40.230 --> 06:42.019
Yeah.

06:43.199 --> 06:46.209
- What about you?
- I work in a shop.

06:50.019 --> 06:51.040
Hiya!

06:51.060 --> 06:53.129
Welcome to the "ladies
with mortgages club."

06:53.149 --> 06:57.050
We'll celebrate this afternoon
at Paula's birthday. We'll drink
a toast

06:57.069 --> 06:58.220
to your new flat!

06:59.000 --> 07:00.050
Gustavo has left me.

07:00.149 --> 07:03.180
The bouncy castle people are
coming
at four. Can you let them in?

07:03.199 --> 07:05.079
Yes, your husband told me.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.029
Hello?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.199
- Thanks so much.
- No trouble.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.019
Sweetie, I'm so happy for you.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.209
Love you, okay? Gotta meeting
now.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.170
See you at the party.
I love you!

07:13.189 --> 07:15.009
Love you too.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.149
Hi, honey.
Where are you?

07:27.170 --> 07:28.139
In the kitchen.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.060
- How are you?
- Fine.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.199
We have to rush.
How was the meeting?

07:32.220 --> 07:34.069
Great.
What about you?

07:34.090 --> 07:35.100
- Good.
- Yeah?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.159
Yes, very good.

07:38.159 --> 07:40.040
We need to make it quick.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.230
- I have 15 minutes.
- I have five.

07:42.009 --> 07:44.000
- I have to go to work.
- Okay.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.220
Hang on.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.159
- We can call him Rafa.
- What?

07:54.230 --> 07:56.149
We can call the baby Rafa.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.149
After Rafa Nadal.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.199
His school pals will be able to
say,
"Come on, Rafa".

08:01.220 --> 08:04.110
But first,
you have to get me pregnant,
right?

08:04.129 --> 08:05.170
Okay.

08:11.019 --> 08:13.009
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Honey!

08:23.050 --> 08:25.009
We've made Rafa with this one,
huh?

08:25.029 --> 08:26.230
They shot out like a smash hit.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.039
You're the best.
Love you.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.049
Bye.

08:41.149 --> 08:43.009
Come on, come on.

08:51.019 --> 08:51.200
Picasso.

08:51.220 --> 08:55.080
Look how incredibly realistic
the wrinkle is on the throat.

08:55.100 --> 08:59.090
First time I saw it I said,
"Crap, it's my granddad."

08:59.210 --> 09:02.000
We've placed Dalí
next to Velázquez,

09:02.019 --> 09:06.080
because maybe you don't know
this,
but Dalí was a big fan of
Velázquez.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.169
What a pity they're made of wax
and can't talk and stuff.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.019
Come here, Sebas.

09:17.039 --> 09:18.169
I'd like to introduce Sebas.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.090
He's one of the wax museum
artists.

09:21.110 --> 09:25.129
You'll be amazed when you hear
how he made Justin Bieber's
fringe.

09:26.009 --> 09:28.009
What? No...
What?

09:29.009 --> 09:31.070
Home owner!
Home owner!

09:33.129 --> 09:35.049
What are you doing here?

09:36.169 --> 09:37.230
Gustavo has left me.

09:38.179 --> 09:39.110
What?

09:39.210 --> 09:41.139
Gustavo left me.

09:43.090 --> 09:44.169
Jesus!

09:45.159 --> 09:46.179
Let's see...

09:46.200 --> 09:49.049
- Look, yellow! Here, Gari!
- Thanks.

09:49.149 --> 09:50.149
Here.

09:52.019 --> 09:53.139
This will look perfect.

09:53.220 --> 09:55.149
How's it going, Genaro?

09:55.169 --> 09:57.129
Are the rugrats behaving?

09:57.149 --> 09:59.070
I'm gonna hire them.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.100
They can help me
in the porter's lodge.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.210
- Need a hand?
- Yes, thanks.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.230
- Know what I'm going to bring
now?
- What?

10:07.009 --> 10:08.190
- More light bulbs!
- Cool!

10:10.059 --> 10:12.009
What's up, Martina?

10:12.090 --> 10:13.200
What's wrong?

10:14.190 --> 10:16.120
Great!

10:16.139 --> 10:19.049
Oh, Mummy's phone is ringing.
Let's see...

10:19.070 --> 10:21.100
What's up, Javier?
How are you fixed?

10:21.190 --> 10:23.100
My cake!
My cake!

10:23.120 --> 10:25.110
Hang on just a second, Javier.

10:25.129 --> 10:26.059
Gari.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.169
Could you pay the cake guy?

10:28.190 --> 10:30.230
It was 25 and a bit.
Make it 27.

10:31.009 --> 10:33.159
- 27.
- He has to give you back 23.

10:33.179 --> 10:35.059
- 27. 23.
- That's it.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.049
- Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

10:37.070 --> 10:37.230
Hiya!

10:38.009 --> 10:39.070
I'm listening, Javier.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.179
The cake, Mummy!

10:41.120 --> 10:43.190
You have to charge 27.

10:44.049 --> 10:47.019
Hang on.
Let's see if I have change.

10:48.039 --> 10:49.070
Look.

10:49.090 --> 10:51.220
Twenty in notes, and the
coins...

10:52.000 --> 10:54.049
I'll take that...
23.

10:58.029 --> 10:59.049
It's 23 euros.

10:59.070 --> 11:01.169
Yeah. Just a second, okay?

11:02.139 --> 11:04.019
Twen.. twen...

11:09.070 --> 11:10.179
Okay, it's fine.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.100
- Okay, bye.
- The cake.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.110
- There you go.
- Okay. Bye.

11:15.159 --> 11:18.000
Crap, I don't think I have
clean towels.

11:18.019 --> 11:20.019
Well, I'll do a wash later.

11:20.039 --> 11:21.080
Whatever.

11:21.100 --> 11:23.139
If you're hungry,
there's food in the fridge.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.120
And cheer up, huh?

11:25.139 --> 11:27.179
You did the right thing coming
here.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.159
Gustavo is a jerk.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.059
Do you think I'm a strict
person?

11:35.220 --> 11:36.190
What?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.090
Am I a strict person?

11:40.070 --> 11:42.000
Gustavo says I am.

11:42.019 --> 11:42.210
No.

11:43.049 --> 11:44.090
Not strict.

11:44.159 --> 11:45.190
So what am I like?

11:46.100 --> 11:48.059
Fussy.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.100
Fussy, how?

11:49.210 --> 11:51.080
You're a bit finicky.

11:51.100 --> 11:53.029
It's not the same thing.

11:53.049 --> 11:56.070
Don't beat yourself up.
You are who you are, end of
story.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.179
And what am I like?

11:58.110 --> 12:01.200
I want to know. Really, tell me.
You're my sister, it's fine.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.129
Can you hand me that box
with poodles on it?

12:09.039 --> 12:10.000
Thanks.

12:11.019 --> 12:12.059
Go ahead, tell me.

12:14.009 --> 12:15.039
Well...

12:16.100 --> 12:17.110
I don't know.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.070
When I started clubbing.
Do you not remember?

12:20.090 --> 12:23.169
You wrote the bus times on my
arm
with a permanent marker

12:23.190 --> 12:26.169
- so I wouldn't get home late.
- I was worried about you.

12:26.190 --> 12:30.029
You're my little sister,
it should be the other way
around.

12:30.049 --> 12:34.009
That's not being fussy,
that's being a responsible
person.

12:35.159 --> 12:36.220
What about your hair?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.049
What about my hair?

12:39.070 --> 12:41.000
You've never changed it.

12:41.019 --> 12:42.159
Since you were eight.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.169
You've never improvised.
Not even a plait, a hair pom
pom.

12:45.190 --> 12:47.059
Nothing, zilch.

12:47.190 --> 12:48.169
Right.

12:49.230 --> 12:51.019
Hey...

12:51.039 --> 12:53.070
It's all right.
You're fantastic.

12:53.090 --> 12:56.000
And if Gustavo doesn't like you,
screw him.

12:56.019 --> 12:57.190
What if I don't like myself?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.019
What are you doing?

13:08.039 --> 13:11.090
Come on, stop it.
Don't start washing up, I'll do
it.

13:11.149 --> 13:13.000
What are you doing?

13:13.149 --> 13:14.120
Look.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.110
Man!

13:19.210 --> 13:23.009
Fucking brilliant! I love your
pussy power!
Come on, cut off more!

13:23.029 --> 13:24.049
Cut off more.

13:25.049 --> 13:26.220
Oh, my God, what the...!

13:28.059 --> 13:29.220
Awesome!

13:30.179 --> 13:32.200
You go, girl! Love your pussy
power!

13:32.220 --> 13:34.090
I cut my hair!

13:34.200 --> 13:36.029
I cut my hair.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.230
I cut my hair!

13:38.159 --> 13:40.039
You're totally crazy!

13:40.059 --> 13:41.100
I'm crazy.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.139
- And I'll do really crazy
stuff.
- Go for it!

13:43.159 --> 13:46.059
I'm going to be untidy.
Not shower.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.059
- Not go to work.
- Get laid!

13:48.080 --> 13:49.100
Yes, go out partying.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.070
- Yeah!
- Get laid, sing!

13:51.090 --> 13:52.230
I'm going to dance, do drugs!

13:53.009 --> 13:55.210
I'm going to do drugs!
Where's your stash of drugs?

13:56.049 --> 13:57.090
Where is it?

13:57.110 --> 13:58.120
No, no...

13:58.220 --> 14:02.029
You've had a real tough day,
María,
it'll make you feel sick.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.230
- What's this? Cocaine?
- Easy.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.159
- No, it's not.
- What is it?

14:06.000 --> 14:06.159
Heroin?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.070
What do you mean heroin?

14:08.090 --> 14:09.190
- It's M.
- What's M?

14:09.210 --> 14:10.149
MDMA.

14:10.169 --> 14:13.000
- The love drug.
- Love? I want it.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.200
You want to go to a kids' party
wired?

14:14.220 --> 14:16.200
Yes, I do.
I'm not in the mood for kids.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.090
- What if you have a bad trip?
- No.

14:18.110 --> 14:20.070
Do I have to dissolve it in
water?

14:20.090 --> 14:23.039
No, suck your finger
and stick it in the sachet.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.110
Just a little bit, okay?

14:27.009 --> 14:29.120
Just a little bit, I said!
Idiot, you'll feel like crap!

14:29.139 --> 14:30.220
It's all right!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.139
- No, it'll be fine. Want some?
- You're gonna get sick!

14:34.169 --> 14:36.019
All right, then.

14:42.039 --> 14:45.200
- You did drugs.
- How long does it take?

14:46.070 --> 14:48.080
María, María.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.139
You're super special.

14:56.129 --> 15:01.120
Whoever loves you will have
to accept you and your
obsessions.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.169
María.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.159
You and your obsessions.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.049
María, María.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.059
What are you doing here?

15:17.129 --> 15:18.190
It's my party.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.009
What do you reckon to this?

15:49.029 --> 15:50.120
It's great here.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.220
We'll throw the next party here.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.139
Well, we'll see.
Don't get your hopes up.

15:55.220 --> 15:59.049
You did a great job with this
party.
I don't make as much effort.

15:59.070 --> 16:02.070
- It got a bit out of hand.
- Hey, we won't complain.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.039
Did you hang up the small flags?

16:04.059 --> 16:07.019
No, Genaro the caretaker helped
me.

16:07.039 --> 16:09.100
- And the gardener, too.
- Awesome.

16:12.149 --> 16:15.000
Hey, Gari.
You're done with that, right?

16:15.230 --> 16:17.019
Yeah, nearly done.

16:17.039 --> 16:18.110
Nearly done?

16:18.129 --> 16:19.179
Come with me, then.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.149
I have something for you.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.000
Okay.

16:24.110 --> 16:26.039
Do you sell many paintings?

16:27.220 --> 16:28.220
Well...

16:29.049 --> 16:31.210
Right now it's a subject that...

16:32.149 --> 16:34.049
It's worthy of discussion.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.049
Why?

16:35.070 --> 16:37.129
- Art versus commerce.
- Sure.

16:37.149 --> 16:41.049
What's the most important thing
for you guys: pure creative art

16:41.070 --> 16:43.129
or public acknowledgement?

16:43.149 --> 16:46.070
Pure creative art always, right?
It's like...

16:46.220 --> 16:48.070
- It's pure.
- Sure.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.110
Sure!

16:49.169 --> 16:51.159
Do you use Instagram?

16:51.179 --> 16:55.049
My niece is an illustrator,
she sells loads of work on it.

16:55.070 --> 16:56.139
- Really?
- Yes.

16:56.159 --> 16:58.139
She has over 50,000 followers.

16:58.159 --> 16:59.090
Wow!

16:59.110 --> 17:00.129
She's called Cactus Girl.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.200
I don't like social media much.
I don't feel comfortable, you
know?

17:05.039 --> 17:07.009
I paint on canvas.

17:07.029 --> 17:09.099
- Oh!
- Sure, I exhibit...

17:09.190 --> 17:11.079
I love your scarf.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.119
- Is it cashmere?
- Yes.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.009
It's "catch me".

17:15.109 --> 17:16.140
- Catch...
- "Catch me"!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.170
Oh, now I get it!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.190
To my retirement.

17:30.190 --> 17:32.039
- More?
- More.

17:32.059 --> 17:34.079
I'm gonna get drunk, Genaro.

17:34.099 --> 17:36.079
I'm glad to have met you.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.039
Me too, Genaro.

17:41.049 --> 17:42.150
Down in one.

17:49.059 --> 17:52.119
Happy birthday to you!

17:53.019 --> 17:57.049
Happy birthday, dear Paula!

17:57.130 --> 18:01.059
Happy birthday to you!

18:03.220 --> 18:06.200
- What's up? You're acting
weird.
- What?

18:07.140 --> 18:10.049
- What did you do to your hair?
- Kids!

18:10.069 --> 18:13.059
- Who fancies a painting class?
- Me!

18:13.079 --> 18:16.160
In you all go, then.
Come in, inside.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.059
Hey, your friend Marta...

18:18.079 --> 18:19.230
- Straight.
- Sure?

18:20.200 --> 18:23.089
They're having a great time.
Thanks.

18:23.109 --> 18:26.029
- Just wait for the painting
class.
- Sure.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.059
We can have a few gins later,
right?

18:28.079 --> 18:30.140
Yes, absolutely.
G&Ts now!

18:30.160 --> 18:32.089
Okay, if you help me clear up.

18:32.109 --> 18:34.029
- Okay?
- Right.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.190
- I'm so wired!
- Me too.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.230
- Anything else?
- A chair and that's it.

18:39.009 --> 18:41.220
- Don't worry, I'll tidy it up
later.
- Okay.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.200
Let's go dance, pick up people.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.029
Dancing and pulling.
And pulling too.

18:46.049 --> 18:48.170
- I have a class.
- Whatever, let's go.

18:48.190 --> 18:51.009
I'm all flexible.
I can feel my skin.

18:51.029 --> 18:53.009
Embrace how you feel, embrace
it.

18:53.079 --> 18:55.130
- I don't know...
- My finger tastes great.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.079
Lick yourself. Touch yourself.
You're gonna freak out.

18:59.099 --> 19:02.059
Feel the greenness.
Go to the castle...

19:02.079 --> 19:05.220
Connect with nature, you'll flip
out.
I really mean it.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.210
Feel the greenness.
I'll come back for you.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.230
Guys!

19:13.029 --> 19:14.069
Pablo!

19:14.140 --> 19:15.210
Where are you?

19:17.089 --> 19:21.140
What a pity, you're going to
miss it.
Well, actually, you're missing
it.

19:22.019 --> 19:23.049
She loved it.

19:23.069 --> 19:24.079
Yes.

19:24.220 --> 19:28.039
Gotta go, Esther's giving
a painting class. Catch you
later.

19:28.059 --> 19:31.150
Yes, sure. See you in a while.
Don't worry.

20:02.109 --> 20:03.170
Hi.

20:04.049 --> 20:05.089
Hi.

20:09.029 --> 20:10.190
What's your name?

20:13.150 --> 20:14.170
Gari.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.029
Gari!

20:22.170 --> 20:24.079
Like GariGrant.

20:27.089 --> 20:29.079
You smell so good.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.220
Can I hold you?

20:32.180 --> 20:33.220
What?

20:35.089 --> 20:37.000
Can I kiss you?

21:00.019 --> 21:03.039
Why do you write in English,
Cactus Girl?

21:05.180 --> 21:07.180
Here, I cleaned them.

21:09.160 --> 21:13.009
Doesn't this drawing
look like a real piece of shit
to you?

21:14.170 --> 21:15.180
No.

21:29.109 --> 21:33.200
Cris, can you fix me one of your
G&Ts
with thingies in it?

21:39.039 --> 21:40.059
What's this?

21:40.140 --> 21:41.190
Vitamins.

21:45.089 --> 21:46.099
No.

21:47.119 --> 21:49.099
- They're not vitamins.
- They are.

21:49.119 --> 21:50.200
Why are you taking the pill?

21:50.220 --> 21:52.220
Hiya!
Any cake left?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.200
- Hi, honey!
- Wow, what's this!

21:54.220 --> 21:58.119
What's Frida Kahlo doing here?
An autograph, please.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.049
- How are you, man?
- Hi.

22:01.140 --> 22:04.079
You're prettier, you know?
You don't have a unibrow.

22:04.099 --> 22:05.200
- You okay?
- Fine.

22:06.109 --> 22:07.119
Relieved.

22:07.140 --> 22:10.069
Finally finished that car
campaign.

22:10.089 --> 22:12.000
That's why I couldn't get away.

22:12.019 --> 22:14.019
No worries.
Put the girls to bed, okay?

22:14.039 --> 22:16.109
No, that's not enough.

22:16.130 --> 22:20.000
You two stay here, have your
girl talk. Don't touch a thing.

22:20.019 --> 22:21.190
My surprise! My surprise!

22:21.210 --> 22:24.029
Look, this is from your mum...

22:24.049 --> 22:25.230
Hey, Martina is sleeping.

22:26.009 --> 22:27.170
Check out this cool motorbike.

22:28.130 --> 22:29.190
What do you reckon?

22:29.210 --> 22:32.119
- How does it work?
- No, we'll try it out tomorrow.

22:32.140 --> 22:34.079
- Yeah!
- Just one thing...

22:34.099 --> 22:38.119
I saw María in the bouncy castle
and she looked a bit out of it.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.220
Because she took a lot of
vitamins.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.230
Yeah, the doctor prescribed them
for this party.

22:45.009 --> 22:45.210
Say goodbye.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.200
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

22:50.099 --> 22:54.230
Give me those vitamins, boy!
Give me the vitamins.

22:55.049 --> 22:56.140
What's up with María?

23:00.009 --> 23:00.170
Mery!

23:00.190 --> 23:05.019
- How many G&Ts have you had?
- About four... Not so many!

23:05.039 --> 23:06.210
Why would she be there?

23:06.230 --> 23:09.000
I don't believe she's in the
castle.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.150
- Yes, she is!
- Look at her.

23:11.019 --> 23:12.029
Mery!

23:12.190 --> 23:14.099
What are you doing there?

23:14.190 --> 23:16.130
Have you been here all the time?

23:17.069 --> 23:19.029
Careful, Esther, careful.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.160
You're so rough.

23:22.210 --> 23:24.069
How do you feel?

23:26.009 --> 23:27.019
Hungover.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.000
No, I mean about Gustavo.

23:30.019 --> 23:33.150
I bet it's nothing.
Tomorrow you'll talk and sort it
out.

23:35.069 --> 23:37.019
Doesn't look that way.

23:40.230 --> 23:44.039
I wanted to start a family and
stuff,
but...

23:44.059 --> 23:45.160
Well, that's that.

23:46.150 --> 23:48.079
I won't have kids.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.119
But I wanted to.

23:50.190 --> 23:52.099
I don't have many eggs left.

23:52.119 --> 23:53.140
Hold on.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.099
No, I don't have many eggs left.

23:55.119 --> 23:58.089
- They said I can freeze some.
- Just chill out.

23:58.109 --> 24:00.089
You're coming down off the M.

24:00.109 --> 24:03.180
You get super analytical,
you think a lot.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.140
What?

24:06.160 --> 24:09.140
Did you come to my daughter's
party
on drugs?

24:10.009 --> 24:11.089
She did too.

24:11.109 --> 24:13.039
Jesus, what a snitch you are!

24:13.059 --> 24:15.210
I don't believe it.
You two are the bloody worst.

24:15.230 --> 24:17.039
Seriously?

24:17.059 --> 24:19.220
- Seriously?
- You take the pill in secret.

24:20.009 --> 24:20.220
What?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.099
The pill?

24:22.220 --> 24:24.160
What about having another kid?

24:24.180 --> 24:26.069
Know what your sister did?

24:26.089 --> 24:28.160
Spent all afternoon
hassling Marquitos's mum.

24:28.180 --> 24:32.140
She's been dying to eat pussy
since she got her period.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.029
You wish!

24:39.000 --> 24:39.150
Hurrah!

24:39.170 --> 24:41.119
Pour it nice and slowly.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.200
- Here's to our new lives.
- To us.

24:43.220 --> 24:46.029
We're gonna kick ass!

24:57.099 --> 24:59.130
What's going on? It's sinking!

24:59.150 --> 25:01.019
What's happening?

25:03.140 --> 25:06.160
- Jesus!
- It's falling on top of us!

25:15.089 --> 25:18.009
7 WEEKS LATER

25:19.140 --> 25:20.210
There it is.

25:21.069 --> 25:22.200
The size of a lentil.

25:26.170 --> 25:29.009
When was your last period?

25:30.089 --> 25:32.210
A month and half ago, almost
two.

25:34.069 --> 25:37.000
Well, you're seven weeks
pregnant.
