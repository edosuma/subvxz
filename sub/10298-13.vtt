01:25.667 --> 01:28.133
Boy, I love the rain.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.667
Have ever since
I was a little boy.

01:30.667 --> 01:36.400
Dad used to say
rain is the sound
of angels flushing.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.667
Good night, Peg

01:38.701 --> 01:41.434
Oh, Al...

01:41.434 --> 01:45.267
Ah, no, Peg, I'm tired.

01:45.267 --> 01:48.701
Aw, come on, honey.
You don't have to be awake.

01:48.701 --> 01:54.067
Just the usual, "I'm done,
how about you?" will be fine.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.267
Oh, come on.

01:55.267 --> 01:56.767
Look, let's compromise.

01:56.767 --> 01:59.033
I'll set the alarm
clock for 2.

01:59.033 --> 02:01.000
That way you can get
a little rest.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.634
And I'll while away
the time listening
to your body ferment.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.367
Great, I'm the only guy
in the world

02:07.367 --> 02:09.901
that has to wake up
to have a nightmare.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.701
Good night, honey.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.767
Good night.
I'll see you at 2.

leaking.

02:39.334 --> 02:41.234
It's raining
on the bed.

02:41.234 --> 02:44.534
Well, it's nice and dry
on my side, honey.

02:44.534 --> 02:47.567
You mean you'd switch
with me, Peg?

02:47.567 --> 02:50.701
No. Oh, come on, Al.

02:50.701 --> 02:51.801
Let's do it.

02:51.801 --> 02:54.667
Show Mommy you can
beat the lightning.

02:54.667 --> 02:56.567
I'm gonna
fix the roof.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.367
Now, why would you
want to go up there

02:58.367 --> 03:02.567
when you could
stay here and fix me?

03:04.634 --> 03:05.868
Because when
I'm done,

03:05.868 --> 03:07.968
the roof won't ask me
to fix it again.

03:22.968 --> 03:24.100
I'll go boil
the water.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.968
No, no, no.
Not this time.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.567
Now, sit down, kids.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.634
Now, look.

03:31.634 --> 03:34.634
I know sometimes
you feel you don't see
enough of your dad.

03:34.634 --> 03:37.634
And you think he's maybe
too busy to care for us.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.968
Well, get ready,

03:38.968 --> 03:41.834
'cause your father
is about to do something for us

03:41.834 --> 03:43.200
that we'll never forget.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.634
And I want us all
to enjoy it as a family.

03:45.634 --> 03:48.534
Now, just look over
at that window.

That was good.

03:57.300 --> 04:00.167
That was really great.
So good.

04:01.567 --> 04:03.167
Okay, kids,
back to bed.

04:03.167 --> 04:06.100
Ah, thanks, Mom.
Tell Dad he was cool.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.133
Yeah.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.467
You know, I'm gonna do
something special for him.

04:11.467 --> 04:14.968
I'm gonna give him back
his wallet.

04:14.968 --> 04:17.300
B-but not the cash.
[SCOFFS]

not far enough.

expect someone

05:45.901 --> 05:47.868
to go up on
that roof with you,

they'd have
to be a total moron.

Oh, no. I'm not
going up there.

05:55.334 --> 05:56.968

05:56.968 --> 05:58.634
Just call
a professional roofer.

ruptured appendix: Call someone.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.501
Whatever happened
to the old American spirit

06:17.501 --> 06:19.434
of "I can fix it myself"?

06:19.434 --> 06:22.467
What happened to
rugged American manhood?

what one Bundy can accomplish.

I want you to say, "There's
no task Daddy can't do."

07:16.667 --> 07:18.767
Yeah, well, circular saws
were new back then.

But, damn it, he carved his own
hook afterwards. He carried on.

07:24.801 --> 07:26.667
You didn't see him
calling someone.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.567
Well, it would have been
difficult for him

07:28.567 --> 07:31.133

left on that other hand.

with the nail gun.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.767

to call a roofer?

of Daddy on the floor
in the wedding album.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.767
Go get the old wading pool
out of the garage,

08:23.767 --> 08:26.100
paint "Here comes stupid"
on the bottom of it

08:26.100 --> 08:28.300
and hold it
under him.

Well, that pool's
kind of old.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.100
Won't Dad fall
right through it?

closer to the ground.

he gonna be doing?

to Mommy.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.267
How much are you making?

09:54.267 --> 09:58.434
Well, uh, Marcie, now,
it's not how much you make,

09:58.434 --> 10:00.934
it's how meaningful
the work is to you.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.334
Sure it is.
How much?

10:04.334 --> 10:08.133
Well, actually,
I'm making $3.40 an hour.

Oh, Marcie, it's the greatest
job in the world.

10:32.534 --> 10:35.000

a little friend.

just the beginning.

11:30.434 --> 11:32.167
With hard work and study,

11:32.167 --> 11:33.801
you could actually
work your way up

Oh, Marcie, believe me,
if he were biting you,

11:57.100 --> 11:58.300
it'd be a lot
more painful.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.868
You'd be screaming

we could do for her.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.167

in pain.

12:21.167 --> 12:24.133
I'm dying.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.901
Al, you're tracking
mud on the carpet.

12:28.801 --> 12:30.601
Well, it's not
all mud.

12:30.601 --> 12:32.567
Some of it's
colon.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.701
So did you fix
the roof, Daddy?

12:42.734 --> 12:44.534
No, pumpkin, I didn't.

12:44.534 --> 12:46.334
When I got up there,
I saw this hole,

12:46.334 --> 12:48.934
but I figured it'd be a lot
more fun to take a header

12:48.934 --> 12:50.801
off the roof into the yard.

12:52.267 --> 12:53.734
Of course I fixed it.

12:53.734 --> 12:55.634
I said I'd fix it
and I fixed it.

12:55.634 --> 12:59.133
So I guess we all know
what Daddy can do now.

13:02.701 --> 13:05.901
Loser no more,
eh, Dad?

13:05.901 --> 13:07.467
Can we call
a roofer now?

13:07.467 --> 13:08.567
No, we can't.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.234
I'm going back up there.

13:10.234 --> 13:12.400
But this I'm going up
with the right equipment.

mask?

13:18.701 --> 13:19.901
No, my love.

13:19.901 --> 13:22.667
The thing to do is to have
the right shoe.

13:22.667 --> 13:26.234
And the left one too, Dad.

13:28.801 --> 13:30.334
Thank you, honey.

13:30.334 --> 13:33.601
Now, damn it, I said I'd fix
that roof, and fix it I will!

did you put in the roof

I'm sorry, Peg,

14:25.801 --> 14:29.234
but I needed something
to break my fall.
