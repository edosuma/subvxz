00:01.269 --> 00:03.304
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.469 --> 00:05.450
'Cause Hot Rod's
just gonna keep goin' after them kids.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.349
Hot Rod... Dunham from Memphis?

00:07.441 --> 00:11.014
I got it on good authority
Boyd's got another shipment coming in.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.681
Maybe we hit that shipment, too.

00:13.046 --> 00:16.186
Keep your head down, think about
the road ahead. You'll make it through okay.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.284
What the hell you know about it?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.488
Here. Save it. For the future.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.530
Raylan, if you don't like the way
I'm running things, you can always quit.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.967
You're gonna
get back to treating me like a deputy.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.966
- Or transfer me.
- Okay.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.637
Sooner the better.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.696
This is Ava.

00:29.796 --> 00:31.833
She's gonna be taking over for me,
starting next week.

00:31.899 --> 00:32.969
Ava.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.544
<i>Plumber got caught with drugs
on his way out.</i>

00:35.802 --> 00:39.011
Girls find out the heroin's dried up,
might get ugly.

00:39.072 --> 00:41.177
What if I can keep it from drying up?

00:41.241 --> 00:43.187
I will help you. Two conditions.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.314
You don't let Judith know
I'm the way in on this shit.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.683
And your man outside,

00:46.747 --> 00:47.885
he gonna have to do something for me.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.858
Without Hot Rod's connection,
how in the goddamn hell

00:49.917 --> 00:51.590
we supposed to
get four bodies across the fence?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.687
Well, it ain't like
we ain't smuggled shit before.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.858
Who? Flores?

00:55.155 --> 00:57.101
I got 50 bricks in the trunk of the car.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.932
You take one for your troubles.
That'll more than cover it.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.735
Take the truck. Drive into Matamoros,
cross the bridge into Brownsville.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.172
I'll see you in Galveston.

02:12.399 --> 02:13.639
God damn it.

02:13.734 --> 02:14.838
What?

02:15.335 --> 02:17.144
Dewey, you ever think
about wearing deodorant?

02:18.171 --> 02:19.172
You saying I stink?

02:19.306 --> 02:22.651
All I'm saying is' you can't smell that,
you best go get your nose checked.

02:22.743 --> 02:23.983
You girls ready?

02:24.444 --> 02:25.923
I'm about ready to kick your ass.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.759
Let's go.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.632
All right. We're done here.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.011
It's like we discussed.
Wait 30 minutes, then head out.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.772
Stay off the highways. No speeding...

02:47.834 --> 02:49.507
Drinking, sex after midnight.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.174
You get lit up, you're just
an employee of the HR Towing Company.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.842
You don't know shit about that cargo.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.010
Yeah, I got it, sweet tits.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.019
Yeah, well, you better.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.626
Now, where in the hell
do you think you're going?

03:02.683 --> 03:05.721
Nah, I ain't smelling your ass
all the way back to Kentucky.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.565
He's your kin. You ride with him.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.328
Don't screw this up.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.039
Told you.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.316
Carl's on his way. The boys ain't far behind.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.710
Yes, sir.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.881
I told you they'd handle this shit.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.225
It's gonna be a good-ass morning.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.162
I believe I can take it from here.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.502
Old Jimmy's a bit of a cold fish, ain't he?

03:45.559 --> 03:49.063
A tired fish, more like it,
and I can't say I blame him.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.837
Well, if you ain't too tired,
I'd love to discuss something with you.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.908
Well, make it quick,

03:56.002 --> 03:58.505
'cause that couch you're sitting on
is calling my name.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.513
I like the way you handle yourself, Boyd.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.279
I know when a man is worth a shit,
and you are.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.758
So I want to tell you this,
'cause I don't want no secrets between us.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.260
You know, full disclosure and shit.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.120
Well, let me guess.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.896
Hot Rod's boys didn't
pull no weapons on you?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.091
Awfully convenient
you had a way over the border

04:18.190 --> 04:19.795
all cocked and ready to go.

04:20.627 --> 04:24.541
Wait. You don't miss a trick, man. Shit.

04:25.232 --> 04:28.372
Well, you know, we was just trying to
make ourselves useful, you know.

04:28.535 --> 04:32.244
Well, in the process, Darryl,
you made yourself a liar.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.117
But you an honest man, Boyd?

04:36.409 --> 04:38.389
A full-blown honest man?

04:39.646 --> 04:42.388
That why you pointing that gun at me
from underneath that desk?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.892
There it is.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.328
I understand how you'd feel that way, Boyd,

04:52.425 --> 04:54.735
but you got to admit' we did deliver.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.499
Well, it seems to me
that that heroin's still a thousand miles away

04:58.598 --> 05:00.578
from being in my possession,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.807
which means you ain't delivered shit yet.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.973
Well, about that.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.181
It would be a terrible shame

05:07.274 --> 05:11.950
if my brother Danny accidentally
made a wrong turn with one of them trucks,

05:12.779 --> 05:17.922
and neither you nor me
nor your partners want that.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.963
So, what is it that you do want,
Darryl Crowe Jr.?

05:30.263 --> 05:33.005
I just want to be
part of the goddamn family, Boyd.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.617
Hi.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.795
I'm Kayla.

05:53.386 --> 05:54.524
Raylan.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.534
Hey, those sound kind of alike, don't they?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.460
Kayla, Raylan.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.703
I suppose they do.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.006
You gonna offer to buy me a drink, Raylan?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.541
Whatever she'd like.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.645
I'll have a tequila on the rocks,
with three limes, please.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.481
Something nice, but don't put my friend here
in the poorhouse.

06:15.842 --> 06:19.847
I read somewhere
tequila's the only liquor isn't a depressant.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.087
Also, pound for pound,
don't give me nearly as bad a hangover.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
Pound for pound, huh?

06:26.486 --> 06:27.988
My father was a boxing fan.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.159
You like boxing?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.832
Not so much these days.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.839
I used to be a fan of those old guys.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.168
Thank you, sugar.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.736
Cheers.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.505
So, what brings you in here tonight?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.282
Actually, I'm on vacation.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.850
Can't remember
the last time I took a vacation.

06:49.843 --> 06:53.222
What I wouldn't give
to be lying on a beach somewhere.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.455
Can I ask you something?

07:00.787 --> 07:02.926
Not gonna be much of a conversation
if you don't.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.296
Let's say you and I
have been dating for just a little while.

07:07.627 --> 07:11.074
I bought you a bikini,
invited you to come down to Miami with me

07:11.197 --> 07:13.199
to see my baby daughter.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.578
That be weird or forward or something?

07:18.471 --> 07:20.109
I love Miami.

07:20.206 --> 07:24.313
And it's so great
you want to spend time with your daughter.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.221
Think I'd go with you right now, you wanted.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.152
Yeah?

07:31.952 --> 07:35.991
My rate is normally $1,000 per day,
but for you...

07:36.990 --> 07:38.628
knock it down to $500.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.772
Yeah, I want to book a flight.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.503
<i>This would be easier
if you'd just point me in his direction.</i>

08:54.234 --> 08:56.077
Marshal, if a DEA agent
showed up in Lexington

08:56.169 --> 08:57.705
asking for information on a fugitive,

08:57.804 --> 08:59.579
there any chance
you'd just open up your files to us?

08:59.672 --> 09:00.810
I take your point.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.980
Besides' you want to know where
Hot Rod Dunham's at, Millers your guy.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.687
All right.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.595
Not too shabby.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.509
There a problem, Henkins?

09:37.343 --> 09:41.689
Alex Miller, meet Deputy US Marshal
Raylan Givens, down from Lexington.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.353
Is that a Ruger?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.258
It's a GP100.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.293
I didn't know DEA still used revolvers.

09:49.456 --> 09:50.730
Well, they don't, officially.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.431
But a .357 will never let you down.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.737
Not like those Glocks or Smith & Wesson 9's.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.572
They jam so bad,
you can spread them on your breakfast toast.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.270
No trouble with the double-action trigger?

10:02.702 --> 10:05.808
Nothing a little oil won't make
as smooth as a Bill Clinton apology.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.415
The marshal says some of Hot Rod Dunham's
crew ended up dead in Mexico.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.388
Hot Rod hasn't
operated south of the border in years.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.418
The guys at EPIC say differently.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.291
Thanks for the tip. I'll look into it.

10:20.386 --> 10:21.831
I'll let you know what turns up.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.424
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to tag along.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.666
Marshal Givens knows Hot Rod a little bit.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.739
So what?
That's why your chief sent you, huh?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.173
I'm on vacation, actually.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.743
Vacation?

10:32.799 --> 10:35.746
And you thought you'd come to Memphis
and kick the hornet's nest, huh?

10:35.802 --> 10:36.940
And have some ribs.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.142
And have some ribs, yeah.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.912
Sorry, Marshal, I can't help you.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.151
Okay-do key.

10:43.243 --> 10:46.190
I'll try Memphis PD' local FBI,
make a few more calls.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.816
I just wanted to come by
as a courtesy, you know,

10:48.915 --> 10:51.156
do unto others and so forth.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.162
When I see Hot Rod,
I'll tell him you said, "Hey."

10:53.253 --> 10:54.493
Marshal.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.429
I like 10 drive.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.507
I assume you're gonna tell SAC about this?

11:02.595 --> 11:03.699
I'll let you tell him, Henkins.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.841
You can tag along' if you like.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.039
Come on.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.029
Well, I can't tell you what it means

11:36.129 --> 11:41.579
to lay these weary eyes
on your beautiful, beautiful face.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.677
You look tired, Boyd.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.046
I'm sorry about all this, Ava.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.984
It's not your fault.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.322
You being properly looked after?

11:56.349 --> 11:59.262
Never thought I'd long
for the Harlan County Detention Center,

11:59.352 --> 12:00.524
that's for sure.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.267
You ain't said anything about my hair.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.834
Well...

12:07.560 --> 12:10.666
It seems to me you should
have always been wearing it that way.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.576
I guess you've been busy.

12:14.667 --> 12:19.047
I'm still just trying to take
the necessary steps to secure our future.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.683
Our future?

12:21.841 --> 12:24.685
I'm gonna get you out of here, Ava Crowder,
I promise you.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.086
I need a favour, Boyd.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.689
Name it.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.054
My friend is in trouble. She's gonna find you.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.462
Do whatever she asks.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.693
Well, you know I will.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.266
Is there anything else that I can do for you?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.631
Just take care of her.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.271
You let me know when it's done.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.703
Ava?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.787
Are you making cocktails now?

13:02.882 --> 13:04.884
Just messing around. You gonna yell at me?

13:06.386 --> 13:09.060
Well, actually, I was hoping I could try it,
you don't mind.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.672
Well, that's pretty good.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.445
Come up with a name for it yet?

13:23.603 --> 13:26.106
Yeah, I call it a "This Place Sucks."

13:26.172 --> 13:30.086
Hey, I know this place
isn't working out the way anyone hoped,

13:31.311 --> 13:34.520
- but your brothers are getting together...
- You mean my uncles?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.757
Yeah. Them.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.095
They're working on something,

13:41.621 --> 13:43.931
supposed to bring in a whole lot of cash.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.262
As soon as I get my cut, we're gone.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.307
We can get a bigger place,
get you set up in school.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.276
Whatever.
- Kendal, no "whatever."

13:53.599 --> 13:54.873
I promise you.

13:55.968 --> 14:00.178
Give it one week, you never have to
see any of them again you don't want to.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.777
Who knows?
Maybe we'll even get you a job as a bartender

14:03.843 --> 14:04.981
in one of them fancy clubs.

14:05.712 --> 14:06.713
You got to be 21.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.287
Get you a fake ID.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.462
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.895
Didn't know you were back.

14:16.989 --> 14:19.026
Late last night.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.635
So? How did it go?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.808
Smooth, like a stripper's ass.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.138
How y'all doing?

14:30.403 --> 14:32.041
Doing good. Pretty quiet.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.485
Hey, Kendal, how about
you get Darryl a plate?

14:36.542 --> 14:39.182
- And give me one of them...
- Café con leche?

14:39.812 --> 14:43.191
Man, you quickly becoming
my favourite person on the planet,

14:43.249 --> 14:44.751
you know that, Kendal?

14:50.757 --> 14:53.897
I feel you all cocked and ready.
What's going on?

14:53.993 --> 14:56.098
You swear to me it went good?

14:56.362 --> 14:58.569
Man, you said you didn't want all the details,

14:58.664 --> 15:01.543
to protect your precious law career.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.512
I just want you to shoot me straight, Darryl.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.105
It's real this time.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.518
We about to become goddamn rich, Wendy.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.283
Remember that phosphate mine?

15:15.381 --> 15:17.520
Multiply that by 100.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.255
Each.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.362
That straight enough for you, Wendy Crowe?

15:23.523 --> 15:26.561
The shipment
isn't even here yet, Mr Crowder.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.233
Mexico was a near disaster, and now you're
telling me that we have new partners.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.140
Am I wrong to find all of this disturbing?

15:34.767 --> 15:36.041
Oh, God.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.043
If they want a cut,
they're partners, Mr Crowder.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.554
Doesn't sound like
we have much choice, does it?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.055
I'll see you then.

15:46.579 --> 15:47.614
What? The dope's not there?

15:47.713 --> 15:48.748
It's on its way.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.385
Yeah, right, it's on its way.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.557
We just have to agree
to this new gang of idiots' terms, right?

15:53.653 --> 15:54.723
Jesus Christ.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.630
Hi, this is Wynn Duffy in 236.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.724
Could you send up
another pot of coffee, please?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.497
Because this one tastes
like my ass on Sunday.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.400
Thank you, dear.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.809
We'll go down to Harlan County,
we'll play nice,

16:08.901 --> 16:10.608
and everything will be fine.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.273
Get some rest. That place can be exhausting.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.314
So, how you know Hot Rod?

16:19.412 --> 16:23.326
He's been branching out. Linked up with
some folks I know in Kentucky.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.260
And you thought
you'd chase on that lead on your vacation?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.157
Well, I was actually packed for Florida
when I got the news.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.666
Florida?

16:30.756 --> 16:32.429
You don't strike me as a

16:33.025 --> 16:34.265
beach person.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.268
My baby girl's down there.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.865
You got a kid?

16:37.964 --> 16:39.102
Jesus.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.542
What did you go and do that for?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.462
Hey, what's the plan?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.005
No one heard nothing yet?

17:10.363 --> 17:13.310
Well, shit. Look at this duo.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.171
Shit.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.042
What's up, Miller? You don't knock no more?

17:17.369 --> 17:19.816
Walked right by the security cameras for you.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.646
Somebody's asleep at the switch.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.544
I see you know Kentucky.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.214
He tell you how he like to swing shovels?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.225
Well, you two
must have made quite an impression,

17:32.318 --> 17:35.356
because now he wants
to talk to the man himself.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.763
That's funny. So do we.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.200
All clear.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.936
These DEA boys coming out
the woodwork like roaches.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.875
What did that mean, "So do we"?

17:44.997 --> 17:47.204
That means that
we ain't seen Hot Rod in days,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.906
so maybe you two
should keep doing y'all constabulating

17:50.002 --> 17:51.413
and let us know where he's at.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.847
You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Jay?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.241
Look, man, we foot soldiers.

17:55.341 --> 17:59.050
We been here all day minding our own,
and we ain't seen the crew in days.

17:59.445 --> 18:00.583
You buying any of this?

18:00.680 --> 18:04.218
Not one bit,
but there's other places we can look.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.058
Okay, you sit on these assholes.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.930
Do not let them call Hot Rod.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.125
We don't want him
getting a heads-up we're coming.

18:15.561 --> 18:16.869
Help you?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.539
Yeah, I'm looking for Boyd Crowder.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.641
Never heard of him.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.877
Look, I don't know
if you playing me or protecting him,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.283
but I'm a friend of his woman.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.049
I promise you, he will want to see me.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.753
Let me see if the owner knows him.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.987
That won't be necessary, Caleb.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.223
I'm Boyd Crowder.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.226
You'll have to forgive my friend Caleb.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.460
We know each other from the mines.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.297
A man spends that much time in the dark,

18:45.391 --> 18:47.803
customer service
ain't one of his strong suits.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.135
My experience, a dog can be trained.

18:50.796 --> 18:51.934
A human can, too.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.312
I didn't get your name, Miss...

18:55.401 --> 18:57.074
Rowena is just fine.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.010
It's a long way out of my routine
to get down here,

18:59.105 --> 19:00.516
which means it's a long way home,

19:00.606 --> 19:03.314
so it's best we just get down to brass tacks.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.781
Very well, then.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.152
Caleb?

19:06.245 --> 19:07.485
Please.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.255
Whatever you need, I'm at your disposal.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.158
Simple.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.792
Once a week,
you get me 100 grams, pure as you can.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.300
I take a cut, give the rest to your woman.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.535
Ava wants heroin?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.207
Guess you weren't expecting that, huh?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.946
Your girl's fitting to take care of herself,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.539
but first you got to take care of me.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.617
Well, what did you have in mind?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.522
I had a partner, woman named Vernon.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.025
Worked with me at the jail,
helped me bring shit inside.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.719
She was murdered.

19:44.984 --> 19:48.454
A man set fire to her house in the middle of
the night and let her burn inside.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.332
You gonna get me my retribution.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.373
Look, I know what I'm asking ain't easy...

19:58.464 --> 20:00.205
It ain't that so much.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.041
It sounds like this fella has it coming.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.748
It just bothers me that I don't know you,

20:10.376 --> 20:14.256
and you know a hell of a lot more
about what my fiancée's doing than I do.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.153
Well, all you need to know,

20:18.417 --> 20:22.229
you want your woman to be safe,
this what has to happen.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.496
How you think he feel being treated like that?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.734
Like a shit smear on their shoes?

20:30.830 --> 20:32.935
- Humiliated.
- Shut up!

20:33.099 --> 20:34.942
Why you think that old,
tired-ass, bourbon-soaked

20:35.034 --> 20:37.105
has-been Miller's on the hunt?

20:37.203 --> 20:40.446
That must be why everybody missing
and why Kentucky down here.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.608
I don't know.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.345
Hey, I ain't gonna tell you guys again.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.888
When is this little DEA punk
gonna learn how to wipe his own ass?

20:49.949 --> 20:51.451
When daddy says he can.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.587
You don't like the truth,
do you, whipping boy?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.063
They keep you in the dark, whipping boy?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.298
All right.

20:57.857 --> 21:01.031
I'm just gonna chalk that up
to you two being upset,

21:01.093 --> 21:02.970
what with half your crew dead in Mexico.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.040
Oh, yeah. You didn't know that?

21:07.133 --> 21:08.305
Yeah.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.540
Federales found them all shot up
in their truck with traces of heroin.

21:11.971 --> 21:12.972
Long gone.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.281
I bet you two boys were
expecting that heroin

21:17.376 --> 21:19.117
to come your way, weren't you?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.288
You know what that means, don't you?

21:28.988 --> 21:30.831
There's a lot up for grabs.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.402
It's "now or never" time, baby.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.830
Hammer and anvil?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.231
Yep.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.142
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey. hey.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.301
Sit your asses down.

21:40.599 --> 21:41.669
God damn it, guys!

21:41.767 --> 21:43.610
You can't shoot us, dude.

21:43.669 --> 21:44.647
What you think ifs gonna look like,

21:44.737 --> 21:45.977
you killing a couple homies in cuffs?

21:46.071 --> 21:47.744
Yeah, I will take the cuffs off after.

21:47.807 --> 21:48.945
You ain't got the balls to do that.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.112
That's Millers department.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.519
Yeah? Try me.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.647
Okay. Who you gonna hit first, huh?

21:55.614 --> 21:58.925
Down goes Frazier, baby!
Down goes Frazier! Yeah!

21:59.418 --> 22:02.456
Hammer and anvil, baby. Hammer and anvil.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.265
Get the keys.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.194
Has he left yet?

22:08.294 --> 22:10.535
No, we still here. What's going on?

22:10.629 --> 22:11.801
<i>The clock is running down.</i>

22:11.931 --> 22:14.104
Boyd Crowder hit back. You tell Hot Rod.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.437
<i>He give us where Boyd Crowder's at,
and maybe he lives.</i>

22:17.937 --> 22:19.280
What the hell now?

22:21.607 --> 22:23.780
Come on. Let's go.

22:35.788 --> 22:36.892
How do I know?

22:37.556 --> 22:40.002
You been with me damn near the entire time.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.069
Where he at? I ain't gonna ask again.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.299
Geez.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.834
All I know is he got a bar up in Harlan.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.671
That's a start. Where?

22:47.833 --> 22:48.971
Try Google.

22:49.134 --> 22:51.580
- You son of...
- No, no, no! Okay, okay! Stop.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.178
I tell you what.

22:57.476 --> 23:00.150
You grab a pencil. I'll draw you a map.

23:00.646 --> 23:03.092
You can't find anything out there
without a map.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.407
I didn't know Hot Rod
was a legitimate businessman.

23:20.499 --> 23:21.705
He ain't.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.508
It's just a way to move the dope.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.674
Put the dope in the tow car
gives him deniability.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.548
It's an old trick, but it still works.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.697
Gun down! Now!

24:03.242 --> 24:04.585
Shit.

24:09.815 --> 24:12.091
Just like you to show up two minutes late.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.155
Hot Rod' what the hell have you
gone and done?

24:15.921 --> 24:17.491
I got greedy.

24:17.589 --> 24:18.727
Anyone else here?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.137
What are you doing here?

24:23.228 --> 24:25.902
Johnny Crowder and three of your boys
turned up dead in Mexico.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.404
At the hands of Boyd' no doubt.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.514
Damn Crowders.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.245
- Miller.
- Yeah?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.788
- You got the flask?
- Yeah.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.318
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

24:41.413 --> 24:44.087
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.
We need an ambulance.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.923
You had this piece of shit
ever since I know you.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.372
It's cheap shit.

24:58.464 --> 25:01.104
What, old dog like you gonna complain?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.447
Old dog being put down.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.175
Shit.

25:10.175 --> 25:14.487
Least I ain't dying in no jail cell,
like your daddy.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.632
Drink up, old man. Drink up.
It'll make you feel better.

25:26.959 --> 25:27.903
Go ahead. There you go.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.666
Drink it down. There you go.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.409
Remember, I gave you that tip?

25:41.673 --> 25:45.052
Turned out to be a DEA sting.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.649
You didn't even know
what your own office was doing.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.086
Yeah.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.596
It landed me in some epic shit.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.861
Almost lost my job.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.381
Hell.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.774
Afternoon.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.736
I'm sorry to disturb your rest,

26:42.801 --> 26:47.614
but the receptionist down the hall
said that you're Elmont Swain.

26:48.540 --> 26:52.147
You come to tell me
I won the sweepstakes, are you?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.721
She sent you here, didn't she?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.430
I'm just here to talk.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.569
Don't lie to me, boy.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.508
Show me that respect, at least.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.474
She said you killed her partner.

27:15.667 --> 27:18.739
Them sending that poison into the prisons,

27:19.071 --> 27:21.517
making my poor Helena overdose.

27:22.407 --> 27:25.752
She was doing time for cheque fraud,
for God's sake.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.986
Didn't deserve that.

27:29.915 --> 27:32.293
Well, if someone killed my woman,
I'd do the same.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.024
That's my Helena.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.501
She's a beautiful woman.

27:40.592 --> 27:43.368
I got a bad heart, bad liver,

27:44.096 --> 27:46.440
and don't got long on this earth.

27:47.499 --> 27:52.039
But if you want to send me to her,
you're gonna have to draw.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.551
Well, unless you want
to meet your maker this fine day,

27:55.641 --> 27:58.121
I'd take my finger off that trigger, Elmont.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.053
But I will tell you this.

28:06.151 --> 28:09.496
Killing an old man in a nursing-home bed
ain't on my bucket list.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.830
In that case,
you better turn around and head out of here.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.867
Well, I'm afraid I can't do that, either.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.003
So we got a problem.

28:22.067 --> 28:25.640
How would you like to get out of here?
Somewhere far away?

28:26.371 --> 28:29.978
I got the money and the motivation
to set you up for life.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.547
Now, how about it?

28:32.644 --> 28:35.215
Won't you save us both a whole lot of trouble

28:35.314 --> 28:38.352
and agree to live out
the rest of your days like a king, Mr Swain?

28:41.186 --> 28:42.722
How much money?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.335
Well, I don't really give a shit,
but I guess it's good news.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.337
Henkins has a concussion,
but he'll be all right.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.737
Rod was your CI, huh?

28:50.829 --> 28:52.604
For the better part of 15 years.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.075
He'd tip me to his competition.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.907
You let him peddle his pot.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.844
And you thought I was dirty, huh?

28:57.903 --> 29:00.213
So, with Jay and Roscoe
after this Boyd Crowder,

29:00.272 --> 29:01.876
you got any notion
of which way they're headed?

29:01.940 --> 29:03.419
I might.

29:03.508 --> 29:05.010
It's still a DEA case, Givens.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.356
If you're headed over there,
goddamn right I'm going with you.

29:24.062 --> 29:27.134
What's your ETA now?
I told you, I need some for Ava.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.105
Let's say two hours.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.579
But I lost track
of those idiots Danny and Dewey.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.048
<i>Can't get them on their cells.</i>

29:33.105 --> 29:34.948
Well, keep trying.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.947
It keeps sending us to the highways.

29:41.046 --> 29:42.616
Well, make it not.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.460
Oh, God, this damn thing don't work.

29:46.551 --> 29:49.555
If we take this road, where does it get us?

29:49.621 --> 29:52.158
I don't know. What road is this?

29:52.391 --> 29:54.632
Dewey, Dewey,
I thought you knew these roads.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.228
I know the highways.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.399
You don't know shit!

29:57.462 --> 29:59.408
If it weren't for me,
y'all wouldn't even be in...

30:00.065 --> 30:03.911
I'm in the middle of nowhere
with a redneck that stinks like my ball sack,

30:04.102 --> 30:07.675
towing a car full of heroin
that will put me away for two lifetimes.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.610
Now, unless you want me
to set up a special meet and greet

30:10.676 --> 30:15.819
with our lord and saviour,
get this damn GPS working, you hear me?

30:17.182 --> 30:18.354
Yeah, man, I hear you.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.655
Amen.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.659
Simple piece of shit.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.014
Help you boys?

30:44.109 --> 30:45.816
You sure can. Y'all got Maker's?

30:45.877 --> 30:47.220
Does the pope shit in the woods?

30:49.047 --> 30:50.549
Doubles. Neat.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.874
God damn! No need 10 gel rough!

31:10.969 --> 31:12.573
Shit, take the money and go.

31:12.671 --> 31:13.706
The money?

31:13.805 --> 31:16.081
Oh, no, you got us all wrong.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.654
We looking for someone
name of Boyd Crowder.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.049
The word is that this his place.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.591
Do you know him?

31:24.249 --> 31:25.819
No. No, I...

31:28.854 --> 31:31.357
Hey, man, take that shit out his mouth
so he can talk, man.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.001
'Scoe! Take it out.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.170
You were saying?

31:38.530 --> 31:39.907
Yeah, yeah, I know him.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.370
Okay.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.380
'Cause your boy killed our crew
and took our drugs,

31:44.436 --> 31:45.847
so this the score.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.411
We gonna let the song play out to the end
so you can think about that,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.681
then you gonna tell us
where we can find him,

31:51.743 --> 31:53.381
or that'll be the last song you ever hear.

31:53.678 --> 31:55.282
He's not even here...

31:55.847 --> 31:57.019
Song ain't over yet.

32:08.393 --> 32:11.374
Ava Crowder?
You're scheduled for a hep-B shot tonight.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.068
Check in with the infirmary before lights out.

32:18.036 --> 32:21.210
You're Crowder?
You're the bitch who messed up our supply?

32:22.207 --> 32:23.709
I'm working on it.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.813
Unless you got a gram
shoved up your pussy for me right now,

32:27.078 --> 32:28.648
you ain't taking care of anything.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.086
I will have something soon.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.552
Something soon.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.763
"Something soon" means shit.

32:37.989 --> 32:41.266
You ain't got anything on you right now,
it's time to catch cold.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.738
No, it's time for you to back off.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.005
This bitch is messing me up.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.668
Look at me.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.308
I said, "Look"!

32:54.339 --> 32:57.616
Don't be preaching none of
your goddess bullshit.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.622
You can cut her and you can out me,

33:03.081 --> 33:05.254
but it's not gonna help you.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.661
Making this bitch bleed will help learn her.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.493
This what you really want to do?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.663
You really want to out someone?

33:15.260 --> 33:17.137
You want to out me, then you out me.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.674
Really cut me.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.709
Don't do this half-assed, fiending bullshit

33:21.800 --> 33:24.474
to make yourself feel bigger and badder.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.140
That don't come from out here.

33:26.204 --> 33:29.117
You deal with that in there.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.886
The real fight is inside you, not out here.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.190
But if you want that real fight,

33:36.948 --> 33:38.154
we can always arrange it.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.154
You just say where and when.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.668
Don't mind if I do.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.033
Hey, Raylan.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.464
Two men after Boyd?

34:58.563 --> 35:00.474
- What?
- Who did this?

35:00.565 --> 35:02.567
Those assholes! They shot next to my ear!

35:02.701 --> 35:03.975
I can! hear you!

35:04.469 --> 35:06.710
Two guys looking for Boyd, right?

35:06.871 --> 35:08.077
- They did this?
- Yeah.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.210
- Where are they?
- The whorehouse!

35:10.709 --> 35:13.315
Hey, wait, man, I don't need this shit!

35:13.411 --> 35:15.220
Wait! What about me?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.054
God damn!

35:17.282 --> 35:19.387
What the hell kind of place is this?

35:21.886 --> 35:22.956
It's real simple.

35:23.054 --> 35:27.799
Crowes want to be responsible for
transporting your heroin across state lines.

35:28.126 --> 35:33.337
We already demonstrated our ability
to successfully navigate the border patrols,

35:33.431 --> 35:35.672
and with the risk that assumes,

35:35.767 --> 35:38.805
we feel we entitled to 20% of the pie,

35:38.903 --> 35:40.644
which leaves plenty to go around.

35:41.773 --> 35:42.843
That's it?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.779
Just that we appreciate the opportunity,

35:45.844 --> 35:49.291
and we are excited
to be a part of all your endeavours.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.587
So that's it?

35:54.252 --> 35:55.322
Yeah.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.799
Well, I just have
a few questions I'd love to get cleared up

35:58.857 --> 36:00.097
before we get into specifics.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.434
Shit, yeah. Such as?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.504
Where are our drugs?

36:04.596 --> 36:06.337
Carl's truck's already arrived.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.603
The other one's still en route.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.003
They'll be here real soon.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.345
Well, maybe we should wait until "real soon"
to finish this discussion.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.511
No, you ain't got to worry, Mr Duffy.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.850
Everybody's gonna be just fine, trust me.

36:19.944 --> 36:25.018
Even if it arrives safely and we agree
to go with you, 20% ain't happening.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.654
Well, what would you consider fair
for this kind of specialised labour?

36:28.720 --> 36:29.892
10%.

36:29.988 --> 36:31.558
And that's of what you actually deliver,

36:31.656 --> 36:33.067
not what you leave Mexico with.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.967
There are three other partners
involved in this enterprise.

36:36.027 --> 36:40.032
If we pay you 20%,
then you're making almost as much as us,

36:40.131 --> 36:42.236
and that hardly seems fair.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.740
Well, if you can't
find someone to get your shit over here,

36:47.839 --> 36:50.718
y'all gonna be splitting exactly jack shit.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.499
Yo, this Audry's famous whorehouse?

37:03.922 --> 37:05.560
It is. But we are closed.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.727
Damn.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.032
What happened,
all the pussy ran out on y'all or something?

37:09.094 --> 37:10.072
We're fumigating.

37:10.161 --> 37:12.038
Fumigating? The whores?

37:13.164 --> 37:14.268
I knew you would like that.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.070
But seriously, though,
I'm gonna need to take a peek inside.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.238
Seriously.

37:19.037 --> 37:22.075
If I got to tell you we're closed again,
we gonna have a problem.

37:22.173 --> 37:23.914
You already got a problem.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.749
Meet Roscoe. Say, hi, Roscoe.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.081
Hi.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.625
Why don't we say 15% and call it a day?

37:30.715 --> 37:32.592
For 15%, I'll smuggle it in myself.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.961
So go ahead and do it, man.
Stop wasting my goddamn time.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.394
Something wrong?

37:45.563 --> 37:48.703
I don't suppose I got to tell y'all
not to reach inside your coats

37:48.767 --> 37:50.303
or do anything accordingly stupid.

37:50.702 --> 37:51.976
Can we help you gentlemen?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.208
I bet you can.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.750
Which one of y'all Boyd Crowder?

37:57.142 --> 37:59.122
Who may I say is asking?

37:59.244 --> 38:01.121
Who? We are.

38:01.479 --> 38:02.719
Well, whoever you are,

38:02.781 --> 38:05.785
taking into consideration everything
that's happened in the last 48 hours,

38:05.884 --> 38:10.663
I take it you're here
for drugs or money or maybe revenge.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.559
Man, this dude!

38:12.724 --> 38:14.897
Yes. God damn, I love it.

38:15.226 --> 38:16.796
But you can keep the revenge.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.966
We'll just take the drugs or the money.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.407
In fact, I'll even let you pick which.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.735
Well, that's mighty considerate.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.510
Boyd Crowders the man.

38:27.505 --> 38:30.076
So, how about it, boys?
What should we give them, huh?

38:30.141 --> 38:31.916
Half a mil? But why stop there?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.081
'Cause y'all probably want the full mil, right?

38:34.145 --> 38:36.989
Or, better yet,
we would just give you all our drugs,

38:37.081 --> 38:39.118
let you take that.
How would that be for you boys?

38:39.184 --> 38:40.959
Don't do this, Boyd.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.929
Now, see, we was
getting along there for a minute, right?

38:44.522 --> 38:47.435
- So don't ruin it.
- Actually, we might have a job opening.

38:47.492 --> 38:51.099
All you got to do is
kill this fella right here, agree to 10%,

38:51.830 --> 38:54.208
and you can become our new smugglers.

38:54.299 --> 38:55.334
Man, is you out your mind?

38:55.433 --> 38:56.844
Ain't nobody doing shit to me.

38:56.935 --> 39:01.441
Or better yet,
why don't we all just pull right now?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.710
Shoot this shit out,

39:03.808 --> 39:05.810
see what's what
when the smoke clears, huh?

39:05.877 --> 39:08.517
Boyd, cool out, man. I'll take 10%.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.718
Shut up, Darryl. It's already too late for that.

39:10.815 --> 39:11.816
Okay.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.624
Come on, boys.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.686
Who's in?

39:15.119 --> 39:20.535
Miller, would you call this a herd,
a gaggle, or a flock of assholes?

39:20.625 --> 39:24.198
I would call this
a United Nations of assholes.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.166
Well' that's funny, 'cause
we were just discussing ratifying some shit.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.747
Boys' we're gonna need you two
to put them guns down.

39:31.836 --> 39:34.043
Raylan, can I be excused from the table?

39:34.138 --> 39:35.981
No, you may not.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.016
Boys.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.157
Reason not the need, Marshal.

39:47.652 --> 39:48.687
Here we go.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.159
I'm sorry?

39:50.922 --> 39:51.992
<i>King Lear?</i>

39:54.325 --> 39:55.326
Shakespeare?

39:58.596 --> 40:02.203
Basically, Lear split his kingdom in half
and gave it to his two daughters,

40:02.500 --> 40:05.242
deal being
Lear get to hang out and keep 100 knights.

40:05.336 --> 40:08.909
They agree, and then later, these two
bitch-ass daughters, they change the deal.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.248
They like, "Well, Daddy,
what you need with 100 knights?"

40:11.342 --> 40:12.844
"50, 10, five."

40:12.911 --> 40:14.254
"What you need with one?"

40:14.779 --> 40:18.352
Lear says, "Reason not the need."

40:18.850 --> 40:20.056
Hot damn!

40:20.118 --> 40:21.893
Reason not the need.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.295
I don't understand
what these two are talking about,

40:26.391 --> 40:28.530
but I got to admit I'm interested.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.402
Well, in the analogy, we be Lear,

40:30.628 --> 40:32.107
and we just want what's rightfully ours,

40:32.196 --> 40:33.732
and then we out, never to be seen again.

40:33.798 --> 40:36.574
And, well, they the bitches.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.378
You can have them and they kingdom.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.211
You two assaulted a DEA agent.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.076
And you got Hot Rod killed.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.285
Yeah, but that's all 'cause of these folks here.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.118
We handed them to you.
You ought to be thanking us.

40:48.212 --> 40:51.659
No way either of you are walking out of here
in anything less than handcuffs.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.121
I'm gonna give you three seconds, Roscoe.

40:57.221 --> 40:58.666
Drop the gun.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.264
Look, now, I know you upset over Hot Rod,

41:01.326 --> 41:02.930
but you know better than to push us, Miller.

41:03.394 --> 41:04.395
No!

41:04.562 --> 41:06.007
Your brother threatened a DEA officer.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.407
Put that gun down, or I'll kill you dead.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.069
Put it down.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.907
Put it down.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.785
Don't do it, Jay.

41:21.412 --> 41:22.789
Put it down.

41:44.002 --> 41:46.608
All right, now.
Watch your head. There you go.

41:52.143 --> 41:54.350
So, what now?
Want to go hunt down some tow trucks?

41:54.612 --> 41:57.957
I'm gonna head back to Lexington,
enjoy some of this vacation.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.018
Yeah, I ought to do that from time to time.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.791
Take some time off, go see my kids.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.699
But somehow,
that never seems to quite end up happening.

42:05.790 --> 42:06.860
Thought you didn't have kids.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.835
No, I never said that.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.403
Take it easy, Miller.

42:34.352 --> 42:36.491
I apologise for running late.

42:36.988 --> 42:40.094
Had a little hiccup with the local authorities.

42:41.025 --> 42:43.665
Really are a criminal, ain't you, son?

42:43.828 --> 42:46.502
Well, I can't deny that, Mr Swain.

42:47.698 --> 42:50.770
I still got my gun, you all try anything.

42:51.936 --> 42:55.110
Relax, Elmont. You on easy street now.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.188
Hell are you doing?

43:05.349 --> 43:08.091
Well, if it's all right with you,
I'm gonna take a piss.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.358
Nothing funny.

43:10.221 --> 43:11.393
Of course not.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.129
Jimmy, get Elmont here his money.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.430
Ease his weary mind.

43:17.095 --> 43:18.472
Now, I'll be right back.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.132
It's done.

43:47.258 --> 43:48.601
Four in a row.

43:48.659 --> 43:49.763
Dang.

43:49.827 --> 43:52.103
Kid, you are sharp, I'll give you that.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.801
What are we doing here, Wendy?

43:55.166 --> 43:57.237
Just waiting for Darryl to make bail.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.909
I don't mean that.

43:59.604 --> 44:01.777
Look, we talked about this.

44:01.839 --> 44:05.343
We just got to stay put
for another couple of days, all right?

44:05.443 --> 44:07.252
We are almost there.

44:08.179 --> 44:09.249
Hey.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.756
Everything all right?

44:12.950 --> 44:15.988
No matter where you at,
it's the same dumb-ass cops

44:16.087 --> 44:19.261
asking the same dumb-ass questions.

44:20.191 --> 44:22.262
- What y'all playing?
- Double solitaire.

44:22.693 --> 44:23.694
You got another deck?

44:23.794 --> 44:24.829
No, sorry.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.034
Hey, I said I ain't got another one.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.811
Damn, son,
what is you scared I'm gonna find?

44:31.869 --> 44:32.973
Nothing, but that's my shit.

44:33.037 --> 44:34.448
Come on, Darryl, what are you doing?

44:34.505 --> 44:36.348
- What you got? Pornos?
- I ain't got nothing.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.851
- Gay porn?
- Darryl!

44:37.942 --> 44:39.182
Shut up.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.456
Ain't no pornos.

44:51.455 --> 44:53.526
It's close to two G's, man.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.297
You want to explain this?

44:56.627 --> 44:57.697
It's mine. I earned it.

44:57.795 --> 44:58.796
You earned it, huh?

44:58.863 --> 45:01.002
What, is you sucking dick in the trailers?

45:01.666 --> 45:03.145
You best answer him, Kendal.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.540
How you get all this?

45:05.636 --> 45:06.637
Go on.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.809
I stole it from the johns that came in.

45:10.808 --> 45:11.843
You...

45:12.210 --> 45:14.212
How you steal... I'm keeping this shit.

45:14.312 --> 45:15.814
- That's mine.
- Ain't shit yours.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.486
When you grow... Kendal! Kendal!

45:20.918 --> 45:23.159
Man, what is wrong with him?

45:23.221 --> 45:25.428
Well, maybe he's just looking for a way out.

45:25.690 --> 45:26.760
A way out?

45:27.992 --> 45:30.666
Why you keep talking about getting out?

45:30.995 --> 45:33.339
We both want out, Darryl. All right?

45:34.065 --> 45:35.100
This place just ain't right.

45:35.199 --> 45:37.236
You sound goddamn stupid.

45:37.902 --> 45:41.509
I got one truck of dope here.
Another one is on the way.

45:42.673 --> 45:45.517
We know the pipeline, we know the players.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.380
I'm fitting to kill three people.

45:48.446 --> 45:51.916
We gonna take over
the entire heroin business in Kentucky.

45:52.016 --> 45:55.122
I don't want that. I don't want no part of that.
Neither does Kendal.

45:55.219 --> 45:59.361
I want my cut of what
all you're about to get in, and then I'm gone.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.702
You don't want that?

46:15.406 --> 46:16.578
I'm here for my shot.

46:17.775 --> 46:19.311
Go on and sit.

46:24.882 --> 46:26.384
You talk to Boyd?

46:26.450 --> 46:28.430
Skinny, little stick of a man?

46:28.486 --> 46:30.625
He able to satisfy all your needs?

46:31.389 --> 46:34.461
I think more important
is whether he was able to satisfy yours.

46:34.558 --> 46:36.504
Well, yes and no.

46:36.594 --> 46:38.801
Must be nice to have a man
to do your every bidding,

46:38.896 --> 46:41.570
'cause he sure done this one real well.

46:41.999 --> 46:43.603
Then we're good.

46:43.834 --> 46:44.938
No.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.111
There's one more thing I need.

46:48.406 --> 46:50.147
Hold on. We had a deal.

46:50.241 --> 46:52.517
See, here's the amazing thing
about you being the convict

46:52.610 --> 46:54.647
and me being the non-convict.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.747
You don't got any leverage.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.462
This is how you do business?

47:00.751 --> 47:03.254
This is why you didn't
want Judith in on this?

47:03.321 --> 47:04.459
You cross her, too?

47:04.522 --> 47:05.967
No, the deal's still good.

47:06.590 --> 47:08.126
See, just one more condition.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.502
See, the first one
was you helping me on the outside,

47:10.594 --> 47:12.437
and this is you helping me on the inside.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.936
You want to hear it or not?

47:19.370 --> 47:21.043
It's no big thing.

47:21.706 --> 47:23.185
You just got to kill Mother Superior.

47:24.975 --> 47:26.386
Come again?

47:26.944 --> 47:30.790
You want your shit, you got to kill Judith.

47:52.169 --> 47:53.375
Jesus Christ.

47:54.372 --> 47:59.378
Is this real,
or has early-onset dementia finally set in,

47:59.477 --> 48:02.083
and I'm starting to see you
in my waking hours?

48:02.747 --> 48:04.192
Got a tip.

48:04.248 --> 48:08.060
Yeah, I heard that from
the DEA SAC in Memphis.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.154
Called to thank me for our assistance.

48:10.488 --> 48:11.865
You're welcome.

48:11.922 --> 48:14.232
So, what,
you're filing reports on your vacation?

48:14.325 --> 48:17.568
That's a violation of
the DOJ employment guidelines.

48:17.661 --> 48:19.038
The vacation was postponed.

48:19.096 --> 48:21.201
I got to take care of a few things first.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.513
Meaning, you can't go on vacation
because you're working.

48:26.504 --> 48:27.744
'Cause that's who you are, Raylan.

48:27.838 --> 48:29.681
Right? You're a working man.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.913
You know, I might be
onto something here, Art.

48:32.009 --> 48:33.852
Wynn Duffy mixing it up with the Crowes?

48:33.944 --> 48:35.287
Don't worry.

48:35.379 --> 48:37.256
DEA's already asked for your assistance.

48:37.348 --> 48:39.555
I'm not gonna take you off the case.

48:39.617 --> 48:41.927
Congratulations. You win again.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.089
You say that like it's a bad thing.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.099
You know what? My wife is right.

48:52.029 --> 48:55.772
I'm the crazy one here,
thinking that you're gonna change.

48:55.866 --> 48:57.812
I mean, what the hell's ever gonna do that?

48:57.902 --> 48:59.779
I've already torn you so many new assholes,

48:59.870 --> 49:01.281
you don't know which one's the original,

49:01.372 --> 49:04.148
but you're still the same guy
that kicked up here from Florida.

49:04.442 --> 49:07.616
I tell you what to do,
you do whatever the hell you want,

49:07.711 --> 49:09.122
somehow it all works out,

49:09.213 --> 49:11.284
and I'm the dumb-ass losing sleep over it.

49:11.382 --> 49:13.658
I asked you to make a choice, Art.

49:13.751 --> 49:15.230
If you don't like the way I do things...

49:15.486 --> 49:17.830
Well, I'm not gonna make that decision.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.458
'Cause I don't have to, right?

49:19.623 --> 49:21.466
I've still got a week and a half.

49:21.559 --> 49:23.561
I'm gonna enjoy my time.

49:24.495 --> 49:25.735
Hell, why am I even talking lo you?

49:25.796 --> 49:27.002
You're not even here.

49:27.097 --> 49:28.269
Art, I'm here.

49:28.732 --> 49:31.611
Let's get to this. Let's just resolve this.

49:32.403 --> 49:33.438
No.

49:33.904 --> 49:37.511
I'm still the goddamn boss,
until somebody tells me otherwise.

49:37.608 --> 49:40.851
And if I say you're not here, you're not here.

50:24.321 --> 50:25.857
You cut it with baby laxative?

50:25.956 --> 50:28.334
Hell, yeah. You didn't know that?

50:28.392 --> 50:29.962
I dealt mostly with pills.

50:30.294 --> 50:34.640
Yeah, man.
I see cocaine, and I just shit my pants.

50:35.399 --> 50:37.538
Yeah, it's all cut with that shit.

50:39.069 --> 50:41.743
What's this cock-knocker doing, man?

50:42.806 --> 50:44.581
I told you we shouldn't have
taken the highway.

50:44.675 --> 50:46.245
Dewey, shut your goddamn mouth.

50:51.849 --> 50:54.227
Hey, asshole, learn how to drive!

50:54.318 --> 50:56.355
You just barked up the wrong tree!

51:05.696 --> 51:07.403
DEA, show me your hands.

51:13.170 --> 51:16.674
Dewey, how far you think
that car is from here?

51:18.842 --> 51:20.014
What the hell you doing?

51:22.680 --> 51:23.681
Officer.

51:24.682 --> 51:27.094
How you doing? ls there a problem?

51:27.184 --> 51:30.791
Won't be, soon as you're down on the
ground with your hands on your head.

51:31.188 --> 51:32.428
That's not necessary.

51:32.957 --> 51:34.732
I believe my weapon says otherwise.

51:35.526 --> 51:37.267
I see you got your gun out.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.738
Ain't gonna work.

51:40.364 --> 51:41.934
You ever hear of the 21-foot rule?

51:42.132 --> 51:43.770
Matter of fact, I have.

51:43.867 --> 51:46.871
Certain kind of man would think that it's fate.

51:47.237 --> 51:50.616
Of all the harmful, epic
bullshit on the Internet,

51:51.408 --> 51:53.410
21-foot rule's top of the list, pal.

51:54.411 --> 51:56.391
Why don't you holster that gun?

51:59.917 --> 52:04.127
I holster ii, you gonna be
the second asshole I shoot today.

52:06.824 --> 52:08.804
I'll make sure to put that on your tombstone.

52:08.892 --> 52:11.303
Here we go.
