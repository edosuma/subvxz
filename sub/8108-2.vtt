WEBVTT

00:33.910 --> 00:35.412
(WHIRRING)

00:35.912 --> 00:37.706
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

00:39.165 --> 00:41.084
<i>MORGAN: Bring it up
about six more feet.</i>

00:42.085 --> 00:44.087
<i>Okay, go ahead
and start dropping it.</i>

00:44.796 --> 00:46.506
(CREAKING)

00:50.260 --> 00:51.928
Whoa. Whoa!

01:07.485 --> 01:09.028
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:22.000 --> 01:23.376
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:56.034 --> 01:57.702
(COUGHING)

02:13.843 --> 02:16.054
Class is over.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.931
What's going on?
Who are you?

02:18.056 --> 02:21.392
I'm a doctor. Did you have
a corneal transplant five years ago?

02:21.518 --> 02:22.393
Yes.

02:22.519 --> 02:24.604
Every other patient who had
a transplanted organ from that donor

02:24.729 --> 02:27.607
is either dead or dying.
You got a purse?

02:30.777 --> 02:31.903
I feel fine.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.697
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

03:09.983 --> 03:14.153
One living, one almost dead,
four fully dead.

03:14.279 --> 03:16.030
Nothing in common
except their donor.

03:16.155 --> 03:19.325
Carl got a new heart and lung,
liver kills him.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.287
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

03:22.412 --> 03:24.706
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

03:24.831 --> 03:27.458
And Frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

03:27.584 --> 03:29.919
he got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.629
All within eight months
of each other.

03:31.754 --> 03:33.089
And in each case,
serious complications

03:33.214 --> 03:34.674
came on suddenly
and without warning.

03:34.799 --> 03:36.009
Which means arrhythmia,

03:36.134 --> 03:38.428
massive pulmonary embolus,
or cerebral bleed.

03:38.553 --> 03:40.680
What did Wilson do for me?

03:44.851 --> 03:47.312
If the donor had an infection
that somehow slipped by screening,

03:47.437 --> 03:48.313
it could lay dormant.

03:48.438 --> 03:49.606
Five organs systems hit,

03:49.731 --> 03:52.609
would need five infections for it
to somehow slip by screening.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.737
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

03:55.862 --> 03:57.780
made me see the colors
I never knew...

03:57.906 --> 03:59.282
THIRTEEN:
None of the donated organs were hit.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.284
Means whatever they got
came from the donor's blood.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.410
That wouldn't help us
narrow down what...

04:02.535 --> 04:04.954
It narrows down who.
Corneal transplants are bloodless.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.164
Means Apple's gonna be fine.

04:06.289 --> 04:09.167
You secure enough in that
theory to send her home?

04:09.292 --> 04:11.628
Guess we could wait till we figure out
what's wrong with Frank.

04:11.753 --> 04:15.340
On the other hand,
Gilbert Gottfried makes me laugh,

04:15.465 --> 04:16.925
and how many colors are there, really?

04:17.050 --> 04:18.343
Once you've got
red, blue and green...

04:18.468 --> 04:21.262
He paid for your lunch, liked
monster trucks and was your conscience.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.263
Autoimmune disease.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.515
ANA at autopsy
of all four victims were normal.

04:24.641 --> 04:27.143
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.354
Antiphospholipid antibodies normal.

04:29.479 --> 04:30.480
Then that leaves cancer.

04:30.605 --> 04:31.689
Cancers have names.

04:31.814 --> 04:34.192
They have a progression.
They affect specific organs.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.612
Bone cancer can't turn into
liver cancer. Forget cancer.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.615
It's cancer.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.700
It's not cancer.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.494
You're right, of course.
What was I thinking?

04:44.619 --> 04:47.246
No single type of cancer
blew up three organs in the chest

04:47.372 --> 04:49.082
while also herniating
the fighter's brain stem.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.125
- The fighter's irrelevant.
- You don't like coincidences?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.795
It'd be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

04:53.920 --> 04:55.004
had nothing else
wrong with them,

04:55.129 --> 04:57.840
like being an idiot, which leads
to getting your head knocked off.

04:57.966 --> 04:59.008
The others had cancer.

04:59.133 --> 05:03.096
Four autopsies and about 1,000 lab tests
say it's not cancer.

05:03.221 --> 05:05.098
Redo the 1,000 tests
and the four autopsies.

05:05.223 --> 05:07.266
Taub and Kutner, check out the donor,
find out which cancer...

05:07.392 --> 05:10.895
He didn't die of cancer. His head got
chopped off in an industrial accident.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.022
Find out which cancer
would have killed him.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.066
Check the home and office
for carcinogens, toxins...

05:15.191 --> 05:16.192
He's been dead
for four years.

05:16.317 --> 05:18.236
I assume his home has been rented
to someone else by now.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.071
Find out which cancer
killed them.

05:22.782 --> 05:23.950
Did I forget you?

05:24.951 --> 05:26.828
You can check out
the patient's eye.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.049
You can put this on Dr. O'Shea.

05:40.591 --> 05:41.801
And some chips.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.804
- Forget your wallet, House?
- No.

05:47.807 --> 05:49.225
I'll take care of it.

05:51.436 --> 05:52.729
Check.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.565
Why are you
following me?

05:56.649 --> 06:00.737
Word is
you're into monster trucks.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.739
- My kids like it.
- But not you?

06:02.864 --> 06:06.325
Predator's okay, but I think
the California Crusher is over-rated.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.709
Are you checking me out?

06:14.834 --> 06:15.877
You're astute.

06:17.587 --> 06:19.839
- No.
- How many pills did you just take?

06:19.964 --> 06:23.092
Vicodin, opioids, some B12.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.053
Need a little kick
in the afternoon.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.680
You got a problem with that?

06:28.973 --> 06:30.892
I think I'm falling in love.

06:31.017 --> 06:32.393
Her right eye's failing.

06:33.186 --> 06:34.020
No, it's not.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.938
Everyone else's transplanted
organs were fine.

06:36.064 --> 06:36.981
Means her eye is fine.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.107
We need to remove the eye.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.817
It's her only working eye.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.487
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

06:42.612 --> 06:44.614
I thought
this way was less insane.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.993
Do you have some ethical problem
with what I'm doing

06:49.118 --> 06:50.578
that you can express
in a unique way,

06:50.703 --> 06:52.288
which might actually make me think
that I'm wrong,

06:52.413 --> 06:53.706
even though
I'll never admit it?

06:53.831 --> 06:54.665
Yes.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.293
(CHUCKLES) You are funny.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.880
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

07:01.005 --> 07:02.924
<i>You want to come over and watch
Prescription Passion</i>

07:03.049 --> 07:04.092
at my place tonight?

07:04.217 --> 07:05.635
You know I'm not gay, right?

07:05.760 --> 07:07.261
Neither am I.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.430
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.932
I'm not coming over
to your home.

07:11.057 --> 07:12.683
I'll grow on you.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.895
(SIGHING)

07:16.813 --> 07:20.608
APPLE: "L-P-E..."

07:20.733 --> 07:22.902
Do I have to be
in the same room with him?

07:23.027 --> 07:25.613
Whatever he's got, you've got.
Fifth line.

07:25.738 --> 07:26.948
Are you sure?

07:27.073 --> 07:29.117
Pretty sure. Fifth line.

07:32.662 --> 07:34.497
Am I going to die?

07:34.622 --> 07:37.125
Could we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.835
Like, maybe, the fifth line.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.340
"F-E-O-S-P."

07:46.968 --> 07:48.302
Damn.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.721
I'm sorry.
We need to remove your eye.

07:50.847 --> 07:52.265
MY eye?

07:52.390 --> 07:56.435
A moment ago, you thought you were
dying. Blind is actually good news.

07:56.561 --> 07:57.645
Unfortunately, he's wrong.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.105
You just did the test...

07:59.230 --> 08:00.565
But she didn't squint.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.108
Which means the eye
thinks it's fine.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.067
It was wrong.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.944
I know. But the eye doesn't think.
The brain thinks.

08:05.069 --> 08:07.572
Which means thinking's wrong,
the brain's wrong.

08:07.697 --> 08:09.448
Which means
it's spread to the brain.

08:09.574 --> 08:11.993
Which means it's too late
for us to remove the eye.

08:12.118 --> 08:16.622
Which means we're gonna have to
remove your whole head.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.292
Don't worry,
it doesn't hurt.

08:20.376 --> 08:21.878
(SCREAMING)

08:25.298 --> 08:29.343
Hallucination.
That's a brain thing, right?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.473
Five hundred different things
can cause hallucination,

08:34.599 --> 08:35.892
doesn't mean
it's neurological.

08:36.017 --> 08:39.520
It does if one of the other
organ recipients also had a brain issue.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.022
Did he just
drop his hands?

08:41.147 --> 08:43.024
No. None of them
had brain issues.

08:43.149 --> 08:45.610
If his pupils dilated,
if his pupils were fixed,

08:45.735 --> 08:46.736
if there's a twitch...

08:46.861 --> 08:48.821
He got hit in the head, he died.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.615
No mystery,
that was your point.

08:50.740 --> 08:54.243
Yesterday. You live, you learn.
Who shot this?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.495
The guy who runs the gym
has a camera.

08:56.621 --> 08:58.497
Uploads the nasty stuff online.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.417
HOUSE: Can't see
the dead guy's face.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.920
If I can't see his face,

09:04.045 --> 09:06.005
can't see the twitch,
can't see the pupils...

09:06.130 --> 09:08.090
THIRTEEN: We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

09:08.216 --> 09:11.093
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

09:11.219 --> 09:13.179
and then somehow
tie both those things

09:13.304 --> 09:14.388
to the construction
worker's liver,

09:14.513 --> 09:17.183
and then possibly meander over
to Frank's pancreatic failure.

09:17.308 --> 09:21.145
But nothing causes
simultaneous brain and heart problems.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.480
Cancer made no sense.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.649
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

09:24.774 --> 09:25.983
DOUGLAS:
That makes no sense.

09:29.153 --> 09:32.573
I know.
I was making a point.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.451
Oh, good,
I thought you were an idiot.

09:37.245 --> 09:39.538
Why are you talking?

09:39.664 --> 09:43.000
Oh, what? The guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

09:44.335 --> 09:46.087
I might be a genius
who just happens to have

09:46.212 --> 09:49.173
a passion
for fixing coffee machines.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.342
No, I'm obviously not,
but that's rude

09:51.467 --> 09:53.511
to make assumptions
about people.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.138
Donor's history came up clean.

09:56.347 --> 09:58.099
(LAUGHS)

09:59.183 --> 10:00.059
Did he just laugh?

10:00.184 --> 10:01.686
No, no, I sneezed.

10:01.811 --> 10:03.813
He's a genius
coffee repairman.

10:03.938 --> 10:06.274
A coffee repairman
who wears Argyle socks?

10:07.900 --> 10:09.777
I thought I already talked about
not judging.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.320
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

10:11.445 --> 10:15.283
What kind of idiot wears Argyle socks
with construction boots?

10:15.408 --> 10:20.746
I'm not an idiot.
I'm just not good at disguises.

10:22.498 --> 10:23.457
Who is he?

10:23.582 --> 10:26.502
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.337
Why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.048
Because I wanted to find out
what you guys found out

10:31.173 --> 10:32.800
before I found out
what he found out,

10:32.925 --> 10:35.428
so I can find out
if I need a private investigator.

10:36.137 --> 10:37.471
So, new.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.515
The donor has no history
of unusual infections,

10:39.640 --> 10:41.600
no international travel
in the 12 months...

10:41.726 --> 10:42.935
(LAUGHS)

10:45.896 --> 10:47.815
Well, seriously,
that's how I sneeze.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.361
He was in Madrid
and the Bahamas.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.904
Credit card receipts
showed no...

10:54.030 --> 10:54.989
The girlfriend paid.

10:55.114 --> 10:55.948
There is no girlfriend.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.366
She was his high-school sweetheart.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.160
High-school sweetheart is married
to his best friend.

10:59.285 --> 11:02.872
I know.
She had a kid four years ago.

11:02.997 --> 11:04.123
Timing fits.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.291
She's still pretty hot,
though.

11:05.416 --> 11:06.584
You find out
anything medical?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.461
Kid has a tummy ache.

11:08.586 --> 11:11.714
Also, the dead guy
was exposed to mercury,

11:11.839 --> 11:14.050
mold and anhydrous perchloric acid

11:14.175 --> 11:16.635
because their sex pad was
next to a garage that was demolished

11:16.761 --> 11:18.596
after those toxins were found.

11:18.721 --> 11:23.059
Oh, yeah,
that will be $2,300.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.644
I'll get you a check.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.063
No, I don't take checks.

11:27.188 --> 11:28.773
You think I'm gonna
stop payment?

11:28.898 --> 11:32.777
- Aren't you?
- Of course I am! $2,300? It's insane.

11:32.902 --> 11:35.321
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing match

11:35.446 --> 11:36.739
from four different angles.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.492
30 percent of the crowd
paid by credit card. I got their names.

11:39.617 --> 11:40.701
Four of them
had digital cameras,

11:40.826 --> 11:43.704
which I composited like NASA did
for the pics of Mars.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.539
You know, the rovers and all that.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.837
<i>HOUSE: Pupils were dilated.</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:52.922
But he didn't
drop his hands,

11:53.047 --> 11:54.131
means he maintained
muscle tensity...

11:54.256 --> 11:55.466
Say it.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.551
You were right.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.886
God, that was petty of me.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.179
He maintained
muscle tensity,

12:00.304 --> 12:02.056
but was momentarily distracted
when he got hit.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.349
That's a temporal lobe seizure.

12:03.474 --> 12:05.226
Does that Pl guy mean
we don't have to break

you went to medical school.

that away from you.

12:10.481 --> 12:11.399

12:11.524 --> 12:13.067

but beyond that...

good chance she's a vegetable,

12:26.872 --> 12:29.834

nothing to look back on.

12:30.418 --> 12:32.795
You're right.
She has so much to live for.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.674
Do we have another patient who is
almost finished with all their living?

12:36.799 --> 12:39.552
So it's okay to stab his brain
because he's old?

12:39.677 --> 12:43.305
No, it's okay to stab his brain
because he's dead if you don't.

12:43.431 --> 12:45.182
Get the widow to say yes.

12:46.976 --> 12:47.893

of the pancreatic failure,

12:50.855 --> 12:52.440

his best chance.

out what's wrong...

13:27.057 --> 13:29.185
No, but her life is still worth...

13:29.310 --> 13:30.478
More than my husband's?

13:30.603 --> 13:32.396

by one thing that attacked one organ.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.838
Thank you so much. And some
peppermint tea when you get a chance?

23:49.137 --> 23:50.722
I need you to sign something.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.225
Consent to chemotherapy.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.186
You found cancer?

23:56.311 --> 23:57.145
No.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.357
Then you have
tests indicating...

24:00.482 --> 24:02.317
- No.
- Then why should I sign it?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.902
That's a good question.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.696
And deserves
a complicated answer.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.492
Placebo effect.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.744
People have confidence in doctors,

24:12.869 --> 24:16.414
they have confidence in diagnoses,
confidence in medicine.

24:16.540 --> 24:19.793
Sometimes they get a little better
just because they think they will.

24:19.918 --> 24:23.046
And that can make us think that
the wrong answer is the right answer,

24:23.171 --> 24:24.714
which is very bad.

24:25.841 --> 24:30.178
So, you do have proof that
it's cancer but you can't tell me

24:30.303 --> 24:33.598
because it might affect
the way I react to the medicine?

24:33.723 --> 24:36.852
If that were true,
and it would certainly make sense,

24:36.977 --> 24:39.396
do you think I could
tell you that it's true?

24:49.739 --> 24:52.826
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.327
20/200 vision.

24:54.452 --> 24:58.290
Didn't you cover all this personal stuff
with Dr. Foreman?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.500
You don't care
who I used to be?

25:00.625 --> 25:03.211
You're a post-corneal transplant
math teacher.

25:03.336 --> 25:06.089
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

25:07.340 --> 25:08.550
I was an architect.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.808
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

25:16.933 --> 25:18.518
The world was ugly.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.441
You think the world would be
any different if your leg was fine?

25:25.817 --> 25:27.027
No.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.905
You think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

25:30.947 --> 25:32.991
I mean,
the doctors told me

25:33.116 --> 25:36.661
that my life was going to be
so much better once I could see.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.998
I would date,
I would dance.

25:40.123 --> 25:45.212
But the guys I hated dancing
with before, I hated dancing with after.

25:45.337 --> 25:48.840
My parents were still dead.
I was still alone.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.093
You're fun.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.262
You don't seem
all that different.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.727
I haven't given up.

26:04.189 --> 26:07.609
Wilson's got a new job.
Hasn't started yet, but...

26:07.734 --> 26:09.152
So, who are we following?

26:09.277 --> 26:10.987
See that lady up there?

26:11.112 --> 26:12.280
You point at the target?

26:12.405 --> 26:15.992
No. I'm following the one halfway
in-between that point and that point.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.499
Pretty.
Who hired you?

26:22.624 --> 26:24.501
No one.
I just like her.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.710
You're stalking her?

26:25.835 --> 26:29.005
No, no, I followed her
out of that bookstore back there.

26:29.130 --> 26:32.342
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.470
So what else can you tell me
that I might care about?

26:35.595 --> 26:38.348
He attends this grief counseling thing
twice a week

26:38.473 --> 26:41.643
where they go around the room
and cry about who's dead.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.687
Cameron's been to his house
several times.

26:43.812 --> 26:47.816
They just talk about death
and losing loved ones.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.414
What... What are you...

27:03.290 --> 27:04.833
If she turns her head,
she's gonna see

27:04.958 --> 27:06.543
that we're walking
in the wrong direction.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.004
No, no, she won't.
I'm very nondescript.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.005
Well, I'm not.

27:10.130 --> 27:12.090
Well, then,
you stay four feet behind me.

27:12.215 --> 27:13.967
How do you know
what they're talking about?

27:14.092 --> 27:18.138
I'm in the same grief counseling group.
I recently lost my mother.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.182
You'd get laid more often
if you told them you lost a kid.

27:21.308 --> 27:22.684
I didn't lose a kid.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.894
You're a Pl,
you can't lie?

27:25.228 --> 27:28.023
I can lie,
I'm just not all that good at it.

27:28.481 --> 27:32.235
Dr. (Buddy's been over to Wilson's twice
and phoned a bunch of times.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.321
Foreman called him.
And the rest of the time

27:34.446 --> 27:36.698
Wilson's been reading
meditation books

27:36.823 --> 27:39.534
and magazines
about restoring barns.

27:39.659 --> 27:40.827
Are you following me?

27:40.952 --> 27:41.953
- No.
- No.

27:42.078 --> 27:42.912
Are you lying?

27:43.038 --> 27:44.497
- No.
- Yes.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.666
Lesson one, commit.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.752
It's making me uncomfortable.

27:48.877 --> 27:49.878
Sorry.

27:52.422 --> 27:54.132
<i>You' re very New! -</i>

27:54.257 --> 27:55.508
More uncomfortable.

27:56.259 --> 27:58.261
She's not your type.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.305
Your type is much
stupider than her.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.390
What did Wilson say about me?

28:02.515 --> 28:03.767
You've never come up.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.103
In the grief counseling,
or in the other...

28:07.228 --> 28:09.939
Anywhere. I got three bugs in his home
and one in his car.

28:10.065 --> 28:13.109
If I didn't know you,
I wouldn't even know you existed.

28:13.234 --> 28:14.694
Which is good news.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.988
Only two things you ignore,
things that aren't important,

28:17.113 --> 28:20.283
and things you wished weren't important,
and wishing never works.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.534
(SIGHS)

28:21.659 --> 28:23.370
(PAGER BEEPING)

28:35.632 --> 28:36.466
She's better.

28:36.591 --> 28:37.801
I could tell at once.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.969
Vomiting is a side effect
of the chemo.

28:40.095 --> 28:42.263
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.599
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.309
I guess it's working.

28:46.434 --> 28:49.187
Can't believe it.
It's cancer.

28:49.312 --> 28:50.563
It's not cancer.

29:03.451 --> 29:06.079
Labs show
that our patient is healthier.

29:06.204 --> 29:09.416
She's gonna get sicker.
Then she's gonna die.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.209
- I brought Thai food.
- What did you see in her?

29:11.334 --> 29:14.462
Nothing. It's not cancer,
all the tests say it's not cancer.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.131
They've always
said it's not cancer.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.091
Treatment proves it's cancer.

29:18.216 --> 29:19.843
Treatment proves
it could be cancer.

29:19.968 --> 29:20.802
It's not cancer.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.303
This was your diagnosis.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.304
I never thought it was cancer.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.931
You treated for cancer.

29:25.056 --> 29:27.016
I thought that what she had
acted like cancer.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.977
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it would respond like cancer.

29:29.102 --> 29:30.770
It did.
Because it's cancer.

29:30.895 --> 29:34.983
We have to find something that
walks like cancer, talks like cancer,

29:35.108 --> 29:37.735
tastes like cancer,
but isn't cancer.

29:37.861 --> 29:40.405
KUTNER: No, we don't.
Better is better, who cares why?

29:40.530 --> 29:43.158
I do.
And so does Tetrault.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.325
Who?

29:44.451 --> 29:47.036
- The dead tuba player.
- Tibalt.

29:47.162 --> 29:50.999
The point is, he died last,
but he died,

29:51.124 --> 29:52.167
which means she's gonna die, too.

29:52.292 --> 29:54.294
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

29:54.419 --> 29:57.130
There's a cancer drug
that's used off-label for arthritis.

29:57.255 --> 29:58.548
There's no record
of arthritis.

29:58.673 --> 30:00.467
Did you interview
all the tuba students?

30:00.592 --> 30:02.385
If he had joint pain in his hands,
he couldn't have played.

30:02.510 --> 30:03.678
Then it wasn't in his hands.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.054
Then why do we care
about his students?

30:05.180 --> 30:07.599
One of them is Canadian,
brought him methotrexate,

30:07.724 --> 30:09.058
so he could
hide his arthritis.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.644
He already couldn't
afford his insurance.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.230
And that little piece
of business cost me $700.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.566
I'm gonna pass it on
to the patient with a steep mark-up.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.568
This makes no sense.

30:18.693 --> 30:19.694
I know.

30:20.236 --> 30:25.283
She's dead, unless we can find
what's cancer, but not cancer.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.333
Something's missing.

30:35.502 --> 30:36.836
<i>(KNOCK ON DOOR)</i>

30:39.506 --> 30:40.965
I need an epiphany.

30:44.010 --> 30:48.223
What are you billing out at?
$300 an hour? Here's $400.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.058
There are other oncologists.

30:50.183 --> 30:52.268
Better oncologists.
But I need you.

30:57.315 --> 31:00.735
Let me describe the symptoms,
problems, issues,

31:00.860 --> 31:02.278
and you say whatever
you feel like saying

31:02.403 --> 31:04.239
until something triggers
an idea in my head.

31:04.364 --> 31:05.281
That's not the way it works.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.116
You have a way
of thinking about things.

31:07.242 --> 31:10.620
It's sloppy, it's undisciplined,
it's not very linear,

31:10.745 --> 31:13.873
it complements mine, drives me
down avenues I wouldn't otherwise...

31:13.998 --> 31:15.792
House, please go away.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.044
Cancer,
but not cancer,

31:18.169 --> 31:20.547
responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no...

31:26.553 --> 31:27.637
How are you?

31:28.930 --> 31:33.935
Don't do this, please.
Please don't do this.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.396
I'm trying to move on.

31:38.439 --> 31:43.570
By hanging out with Cameron, and talking
to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me?

31:48.741 --> 31:50.118
Lull

31:51.119 --> 31:53.913
I paid a private investigator
to spy on you.

31:54.914 --> 31:55.957
(SIGHS)

31:56.082 --> 31:57.208
You didn't.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.669
You want to move on from me,
you gotta deal with me, talk to me.

31:59.794 --> 32:01.212
You had no right.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.965
We're not friends anymore.
There's no trust to be breached.

32:04.090 --> 32:08.094
I can have you followed,
I can call you names, tell your secrets.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.974
Foreman did a CT.

32:13.099 --> 32:16.477
Temporal and frontoparietal regions,
normal. Occipital lobe, normal.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.647
I have the right
to walk away from you, House.

32:20.398 --> 32:22.900
There is a world beyond you,
you need to realize that.

32:23.026 --> 32:26.696
And even if you don't,
I'm moving on.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.949
The next time you knock,
I'm not answering.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.372
Nothing yet. Keep talking.

32:46.799 --> 32:48.134
I'm sorry.

32:49.469 --> 32:52.430
You charge me for listening in
on my own conversations?

32:52.555 --> 32:54.349
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

32:54.474 --> 32:55.642
How many friends do you have?

32:55.767 --> 32:57.060
Seventeen.

32:57.185 --> 32:59.771
Seriously?
You have a list?

32:59.896 --> 33:02.065
No, I knew this conversation
was really about you,

33:02.190 --> 33:04.108
so I just gave you an answer
so you could get back

33:04.233 --> 33:05.735
to your train of thought.

33:05.860 --> 33:08.946
Well done.
I have one. Had one.

33:09.072 --> 33:10.823
Friends are important,
you're gonna miss...

33:10.948 --> 33:11.949
Shut up.

33:12.075 --> 33:15.119
Friends allow you
to not sit in a room by yourself.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.537
Are you charging me for this?

33:16.663 --> 33:18.247
- Are we friends?
- No.

33:18.373 --> 33:19.624
Then, yes.

33:19.749 --> 33:21.459
Do you want to be my friend?

33:21.584 --> 33:22.585
No. You scare me a little.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.671
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me.

33:24.796 --> 33:26.756
We can talk,
we can be two human beings talking.

33:26.881 --> 33:29.008
I'm with him.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

33:29.133 --> 33:31.052
Yes, you did.
I was in the middle of a sentence.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.263
Yes, I did.
You were repeating yourself.

33:34.389 --> 33:35.932
I'm grateful.
Make your point.

33:36.057 --> 33:38.267
It's like that "cancer, but not cancer"
thing you were talking about.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.770
Friends are friends,
customers are customers,

33:40.895 --> 33:42.772
and everything else
is everything else.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.440
If it's not,
nothing is nothing.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.446
And anything
can be anything.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.493
10:10, stop the clock.

33:55.618 --> 33:56.494
What?

33:56.619 --> 33:59.205
The world is not as ugly
as she thinks it is.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.171
Cancer, but not cancer.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.426
It doesn't make
any sense, unless...

34:12.927 --> 34:14.637
Brain, but not brain.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.223
Occipital lobe's normal,
but her eyes suck.

34:17.348 --> 34:18.891
That lobe should
be compensating.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.393
Since it's not,
that tells me that

34:20.518 --> 34:22.937
something's in there
that shouldn't be in there.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.857
Brain, but not brain.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.150
Why are you in my office?

34:27.275 --> 34:30.528
To find the anomaly, I need
to chop off the top of her head.

34:30.653 --> 34:33.030
Pretty sure I need
your approval for that.

34:33.156 --> 34:35.575
I'm going to trust
your first instinct.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.952
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.955
I'm ordering her cancer treatment
to be continued.

34:43.082 --> 34:45.960
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

34:46.085 --> 34:48.254
Cancer stem cells are real.

34:48.379 --> 34:49.839
They explain everything.

34:49.964 --> 34:51.549
They're like
embryonic stem cells,

34:51.674 --> 34:52.633
they can become
whatever they want.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.969
The donor had them,
the recipients got them.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.013
<i>They floated around,
they landed on an organ,</i>

34:57.138 --> 34:59.474
<i>got bathed in cytomes,
partially differentiated.</i>

34:59.599 --> 35:01.726
<i>And the key word
there is "partially."</i>

35:01.851 --> 35:04.270
<i>In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.</i>

35:04.395 --> 35:06.689
<i>In the tennis player
they became heart, but not heart.</i>

35:06.814 --> 35:08.566
<i>Stop me if you've
figured out the pattern.</i>

35:08.691 --> 35:09.567
<i>They looked as
if they belonged,</i>

35:09.692 --> 35:10.943
<i>but they weren't
doing their jobs.</i>

35:11.068 --> 35:13.154
<i>And when they were
really needed, boom.</i>

35:13.279 --> 35:16.532
Chemo worked
because the cells were basically tumors,

35:16.657 --> 35:18.075
chemo shrunk them.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.580
You're still gonna say no,
aren't you?

35:22.705 --> 35:23.956
You have no proof.

35:24.081 --> 35:24.916
I have the brain scan.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.501
The normal brain scan.

35:26.626 --> 35:28.461
This is why I need
to take off her head.

35:28.586 --> 35:30.213
To treat?
Or to prove you're right?

35:30.338 --> 35:31.214
To treat.

35:32.089 --> 35:35.134
Chemo's not killing anything,
it's just hiding the real problem.

35:35.259 --> 35:36.469
She's gonna crash.

35:36.594 --> 35:40.181
If we wait until she does crash,
it might be too late.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.600
So, the next step is what?

35:42.725 --> 35:45.686
I say no, and then you do
something to make her crash,

35:45.812 --> 35:48.147
so that I'll think
you've proven your theory?

35:48.272 --> 35:49.440
I would never do that.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.817
No. You won't.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.943
(BEEPING)

37:16.068 --> 37:16.944
She's crashing.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.821
(RAPID BEEPING)

37:28.789 --> 37:30.166
(WHIRRING)

37:58.819 --> 38:00.780
<i>HOUSE:
You might want to check her IV.</i>

38:02.073 --> 38:06.744
<i>From here, it looks like saline
instead of chemo.</i>

38:06.869 --> 38:09.038
Yeah,
they look identical.

38:09.163 --> 38:11.248
<i>Still,
you should probably check.</i>

38:13.960 --> 38:15.753
You switched her meds?

38:15.878 --> 38:17.922
<i>How could I?
I had no access.</i>

38:18.631 --> 38:19.590
Close her back up.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.133
<i>Do the surgery.</i>

38:21.258 --> 38:22.301
There's no reason.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.011
<i>There's no reason not to.</i>

38:24.136 --> 38:26.389
<i>The stupidly dangerous part
is already over with.</i>

38:26.514 --> 38:28.265
We're ready
with the neural net.

38:48.869 --> 38:52.581
(EXCLAIMS)
Is that someone's brain?

38:52.707 --> 38:54.875
Except for the part
that isn't brain.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.383
Hey, that's the patient I...

39:04.427 --> 39:05.636
You said she'd be fine.

39:05.761 --> 39:07.304
I'm a better liar
than you are.

39:07.430 --> 39:09.181
I swapped her meds.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.474
I mean,
she's got a brain problem?

39:10.599 --> 39:12.810
- I could have killed her.
- Yeah.

39:13.769 --> 39:17.606
The neural net will show us
how fast her neurons are firing.

39:17.732 --> 39:21.777
If there's something in the way,
say brain that's not brain,

39:21.902 --> 39:25.281
her normal neural impulses
will be sucked into a vortex,

39:25.406 --> 39:27.658
because they're
unable to do their job.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.160
The computer
will then process it,

39:29.285 --> 39:31.662
give us a picture
of where to cut.

39:31.787 --> 39:32.913
Cool.

39:33.914 --> 39:34.707
Excuse me?

39:34.832 --> 39:37.293
Sorry, I thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

39:37.418 --> 39:41.422
You think all this is amazingly cool
and you have no one else,

39:41.547 --> 39:44.800
so you're paying a guy to listen.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.179
Sorry, just trying
to save you some cash.

39:48.304 --> 39:49.221
I'm on the clock?

39:49.346 --> 39:50.222
Yeah, why wouldn't you be?

39:50.347 --> 39:52.058
You think this is
interesting to me?

39:52.183 --> 39:53.726
<i>CHASE: House.</i>

39:54.602 --> 39:57.104
I see it.
Can you get it?

39:57.229 --> 39:58.606
I think so.

39:58.731 --> 40:01.067
Turns out
you didn't kill her.

40:01.192 --> 40:05.029
Cool. You owe me $5,000.

40:20.336 --> 40:22.755
Why are you just standing there,
Dr. House?

40:26.217 --> 40:27.843
How'd you know who it is?

40:29.053 --> 40:30.179
I can smell you.

40:32.056 --> 40:34.433
Yeah,
like you're a field of roses.

40:34.767 --> 40:36.310
(BUZZING)

40:40.272 --> 40:41.816
Peppermint tea.

40:41.941 --> 40:44.360
You ever hear
of the boy who cried wolf?

40:44.485 --> 40:46.570
Never really bought that.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.365
I don't care how often a kid cries
he's being eaten by a wolf,

40:49.490 --> 40:51.075
Mom's gonna come running.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.165
The world is ugly.

40:59.166 --> 41:02.336
People kill,
they go hungry.

41:02.837 --> 41:04.547
(BUZZING)

41:07.133 --> 41:08.384
Just proving a point.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.391
People are asses.

41:15.516 --> 41:16.976
Why are you telling me this stuff?

41:17.101 --> 41:19.854
Because the world isn't as ugly
as you think it is.

41:19.979 --> 41:22.898
Your transplanted cornea is fine,
your eye is fine,

41:23.023 --> 41:26.026
but your brain
wasn't working right.

41:26.152 --> 41:28.362
I'm gonna take the gauze
off your eyes now.

41:29.155 --> 41:31.282
- It's gonna be bright.
- I know.

41:31.407 --> 41:33.826
The brain cells
that weren't brain cells

41:33.951 --> 41:37.955
were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

41:38.080 --> 41:41.167
After the transplant,
you could see, but not see.

41:41.292 --> 41:43.502
I could see,
I could read.

41:43.627 --> 41:48.382
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray. I don't know.

41:49.091 --> 41:51.302
What I do know
is that you were not seeing

41:51.427 --> 41:52.845
what everyone else
was seeing.

41:52.970 --> 41:56.557
And now?
Things are gonna be

41:58.184 --> 41:59.310
beautiful?

42:00.144 --> 42:02.021
Things will be
what they are.

42:22.917 --> 42:24.501
How do I look?

42:29.048 --> 42:30.799
You look sad.

42:53.113 --> 42:54.406
Hey.

42:55.616 --> 42:58.327
Is there any way
I could put you on retainer?
