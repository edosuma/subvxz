WEBVTT

00:05.473 --> 00:07.341
Previously on ER:

00:07.375 --> 00:08.309
Welcome back.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.177
How have you been?

00:09.210 --> 00:10.211
Good.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.445
I'm back in med school.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.780
Really?

00:12.813 --> 00:14.615
I know
I'm supposed to feel

00:14.648 --> 00:17.285
like I want to carry
a baby, but I don't.

00:17.318 --> 00:22.156
Once that baby's inside of you,
it's, I mean, it's incredible.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.691
Kerry, I don't want it.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.426
Abby, would you be
interested

00:25.459 --> 00:27.228
in studying
together sometime?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.562
Sorry?

00:28.596 --> 00:31.065
I'm good at the academic
stuff, you know?

00:31.099 --> 00:33.201
But you're good
with everything else.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.236
Maybe we could
help each other.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.171
Okay.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.776
TAGGART:
Four-day-old full-term male.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.212
Mottled, lethargic, retractions.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.213
Has NICU been called?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.214
They're on the way.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.315
Pratt's intubating.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.217
Suction.
Tube's too big.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.251
Give me the 3-0.
I'm Doctor Carter.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.253
What's his name.
Jacob.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.223
It won't advance.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.825
Sat's are good,
try again.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.727
Anatomy's distorted.
Here, go for it.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.664
Just brought him home.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.199
He started gasping

01:05.233 --> 01:06.234
and sweating while
I was feeding him.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.368
Mm-hmm.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.376
Okay, Pratt, bag him.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.747
Equal breath sounds.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.449
200 of cefotax
for presumed sepsis.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.450
Where the hell is NICU?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.318
Is he going to be okay?

01:24.352 --> 01:26.220
Yeah, we're taking
care of him.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.256
Systolic ejection
murmur, weak
femoral pulses,

01:28.289 --> 01:29.757
and distress
while feeding.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.758
What's your diagnosis,
Pratt?
Ductal dependent

01:30.791 --> 01:32.260
cardiac lesion.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.261
Matt Gillespie,

01:33.294 --> 01:34.262
R3, pediatrics.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.264
Sam, P.G.E. infusion

01:36.297 --> 01:39.267
at point oh-five mikes,
quickly.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.269
Oh, doing your
NICU rotation, huh?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.537
Just when I was getting used
to my double life in the ER.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.273
Wait, wh-wh-wh-what's
happening? Please.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.640
PRATT:
We think Jacob might have
a heart problem.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.641
Wait, you think?

01:47.675 --> 01:48.809
ABG's back,

01:48.842 --> 01:50.278
metabolic acidosis,
minus 18.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.812
Wh-Wh-What does that mean?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.881
It means that his body's
not getting enough oxygen,

01:53.914 --> 01:56.284
but the breathing tube and fluid
should help with that.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.585
Sam, ten of bicarb,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.287
50 of saline.
I only have two hands,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.288
and he only has
one line.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.722
Abby, bag him.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.224
Neela, tell cards
to meet us in the NICU.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.758
Sam can start the
prostins on the way.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.494
We'll take it
from here.
I'll help you up.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.196
We don't need any help.
No. If he starts crashing,

02:08.229 --> 02:09.396
you're going to need
an extra set of hands.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.299
SAM:
Here, push this.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.267
It can be very difficult
to diagnose congenital
heart disease.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.735
Well, his doctor
saw him yesterday.
She missed this?

02:14.768 --> 02:16.404
Well, there may have been
nothing to miss.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.272
Sometimes, the symptoms
don't present right away.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.374
Well, how serious
is this?
We don't know yet.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.410
Cards will meet us
with the echo and a
Rashkind, just in case.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.312
In case of what?
Uh, cardiology
will talk to you.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.546
I just want
to talk to someone

02:25.579 --> 02:27.348
who knows what the hell
is going on.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.550
Listen, he may
need a septostomy.
What? A what?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.485
All right, everybody
off the elevator. Out!
Why don't we take the next one?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.287
That way, I can explain
everything to you.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.555
SAM:
Mean's down to 34.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.789
He needs pressors.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.625
Aeration's good,
sat's are 93.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.692
He's in

02:38.726 --> 02:41.462
very good hands.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.334
Back off the FIO2.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.269
We don't want to flood
the lungs.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.438
He'll be okay
once he's got the
prostins on board.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.772
When'd you two
start your rotation?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.574
About five minutes ago.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.943
Well, the NICU's great:
intubations, chest tubes,

02:55.976 --> 02:57.678
umbilical lines--
you'll get to
do all sorts

02:57.711 --> 03:00.548
of teeny, tiny,
kick-ass procedures.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.915
KATE:
Cards is waiting

03:01.949 --> 03:03.251
and Raab is pissed.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.918
You trying to give him
a pneumo?

03:04.952 --> 03:06.887
Good luck, you two.
Yeah, you're going
to love it.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.722
Let's get out of here.
I hate the NICU.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.424
Those guys are screwed.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074

04:01.509 --> 04:03.511
Humphrey Fowler, Ex 33 weeker,
day of life 58.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.314
Status post RDS,
on vanco for MRSA,

04:06.347 --> 04:09.517
day 19 of 21.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.951
Who names their
kid Humphrey?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.353
Please, Abby,
it's the last one.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.488
Post-op day 46
for C-CAM repair.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.524
C-CAM?
Congenital cystic
adenomatoid malformation.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.527
Was on the oscillator,
weaning the map and amp.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.629
Born with only one lung,
but other than that,

04:21.661 --> 04:22.963
he's doing
great, okay?
Okay.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.533
You didn't keep flow
sheets, index cards?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.767
It's all up in here.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.836
Please tell me
you're joking.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.338
( singing )
You don't need
any paperwork for this kid.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.539
Bad hypoxic
encephalopathy.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.507
His brain's mush...

04:33.541 --> 04:34.875
but, um, his
vitals are good.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.410
He can go on like
this indefinitely.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.678
Family won't
withdraw support?

04:37.711 --> 04:39.813
Two months
and about $2 million later,

04:39.847 --> 04:43.651
Mom's still holding out
for a miracle.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.786
They're here every day.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.588
He's a paperweight.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
There's nothing to do.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.493
Come on, they're
waiting for us.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.828
Thank you so much
for joining us.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.998
I'm Doctor Raab,
director of Neonatology.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.768
We round twice a
day, 7:00 and 4:00.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.670
You will come
ready to present
overnight data

05:02.703 --> 05:04.638
and exams on
your patients.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.574
Everyone scrubs
for a full three minutes

05:06.607 --> 05:08.075
before you enter the NICU.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.578
No jewelry on the hands--
spreads bacteria.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.381
Not even my
wedding band?
No, and cut your fingernails.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.915
In 1993, two children

05:14.948 --> 05:17.851
were abducted
from this unit.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.754
That explains the
little LoJacks around
their little ankles.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.523
You will be issued a code
for this door.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.057
Do not give your code
to anyone.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.759
I tattooed mine
on my scrotum.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.728
Believe me, no one'll
ever see it there.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.463
Dr. Gillespie,
back already?

05:29.497 --> 05:31.399
Another month
in the box.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.735
Your stand-up routine might
go over on other rotations,

05:34.768 --> 05:36.970
but the NICU
is a tough room.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.406
Who do we have here?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.773
Lloyd Roberts,
ex 38 weeker

05:39.807 --> 05:41.609
admitted for TTN.
and detox.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.644
What's TTN?
Transient Tachypnia
of the Newborn,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.913
resulting from delayed
clearance of the
fetal lung fluid.

05:45.946 --> 05:46.980
Good.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.517
Continue, Kate.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.985
Born to 23-year-old G4P4 mom

05:52.019 --> 05:53.921
who used methamphetamine
and heroin during pregnancy.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.989
Don't we need to be keeping
our voices down?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.958
Confidentiality
doesn't exist here.

05:57.991 --> 05:58.992
The quieter we talk,

05:59.026 --> 06:00.494
the harder they listen.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.695
Kate, your plan?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.464
DC the O2,
continue amp and gent,

06:03.497 --> 06:04.665
advance the feeds,

06:04.698 --> 06:06.099
morphine taper.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.801
Did you name him yet?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.470
Everyone, meet Virgie.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.439
20-years-plus
as a NICU nurse.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.973
Her mission:
to protect the babies

06:13.006 --> 06:14.642
from the likes of you.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.143
Haven't had a
Thor in a while.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.678
We have a tradition

06:17.711 --> 06:19.012
of giving the babies
tough-guy nicknames.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.180
Hard to fight

06:20.213 --> 06:22.716
with a name
like Lloyd.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.986
Latest gas on Jacob Kolber.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.655
Acidosis is worse.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.823
What was the final read
on the echo?

06:29.857 --> 06:32.025
Come on, people,
who picked him up?

06:32.059 --> 06:34.027
Lockhart, he's yours. Go.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.663
Examine your patient.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.831
Cardiology confirmed
a critical coarct.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.033
Which is...?
Narrowing of the aorta,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.835
usually near the
ductus arteriosus.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.704
And why do we care?

06:43.737 --> 06:46.173
Because blood can't get
to the lower half of the body.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.476
Why is that bad?

06:49.142 --> 06:51.479
His legs need blood?

06:51.512 --> 06:52.846
If you don't know,
don't guess.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.048
Decreased perfusion
means acidosis,

06:55.082 --> 06:56.784
shock and heart failure.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.118
His means
have been drifting down.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.722
LOCKHART:
Lungs are wet.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.857
I can barely palpate
the femorals.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.693
Ten of bicarb,

07:05.726 --> 07:08.596
start dopa at 12,
crank up the prostins
to point one.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.230
He needs the O.R.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.865
But the cardiologist said
you'd try medicine first.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.200
The medicine
isn't working.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.735
CT surg is backed
up, said they'd

07:14.768 --> 07:16.036
get to him in the
next 48 hours.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.805
This boy is not waiting
48 hours.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.040
If they can't take him
to the O.R.,
they can take him

07:20.073 --> 07:21.709
to the cath lab
for dilation and stenting.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.876
Stenting?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.512
Another way to
open a blockage.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.079
It's blocked? You said
it was just too narrow.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.081
So narrow, the blood
isn't getting through.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.552
Tom, uh, send off
LFTs and creatinine,

07:31.585 --> 07:33.053
check for
end-organ damage.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.822
TOM:
You got it.

07:34.855 --> 07:35.989
KYLE:
I-I-I want to talk
to that cardiologist again,

07:36.023 --> 07:37.090
all right?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.126
Mr. and Mrs. Kolber,

07:39.159 --> 07:40.794
Jacob is very sick,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.163
but all this is really
just a plumbing problem.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.032
Nothing that a CT
surgeon can't fix.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.033
Surgery will cure him?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.001
It should, yes.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.904
Dr. Lockhart,
he needs

07:50.938 --> 07:52.740
a nickname.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.875
How about Jake?

07:54.908 --> 07:56.143
Sounds tough to me.

07:56.176 --> 08:00.047
Jacob to Jake--
very creative.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.184
Thin mec,
delivery room three.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.756
What are you
waiting for? Go!

08:08.789 --> 08:12.693
50 cc saline bolus,
push it, Tom.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.731
Dr. Lockhart, what
are you waiting for?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.199
Go-- you could
learn something.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.168
Yeah, I'd like
to stay here, if that's okay.

08:21.201 --> 08:24.237
Covering deliveries
is part of your job-- go.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.074
Tom, we need
another I-STAT
to see where we are.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.576
Dr. Raab...

08:28.609 --> 08:31.078
And he needs a foley
and another PIV.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.078
I can do that.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.212
He's my patient.

08:36.784 --> 08:40.087
Get CT Surg on the phone
and tell them your patient

08:40.120 --> 08:41.955
needs the O.R.
right now.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.091
Not in 48 hours,
not sometime today,
right now.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.593
I'll be right back.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.960
NEELA:
So when the DL phone rings

08:46.994 --> 08:47.761
we drop everything
and run?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.697
Yup, 24/7.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.765
It means some
potentially sick-assed
baby's being born.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.200
Kid ends up being fine
but you never know.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.234
Can I do the intubation?

08:54.267 --> 08:55.603
If it's indicated,
I mean.

08:55.603 --> 08:57.004
Oh, you like
this stuff.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.606
The technology's
fascinating...

08:58.606 --> 08:59.740
What's wrong with us?

08:59.773 --> 09:01.208
We should be in
the easy,

09:01.241 --> 09:02.610
lucrative specialties:
Derm... radiology...

09:02.643 --> 09:03.944
Okay, little gunner,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.245
welcome to your
very first delivery.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.316
Hey, Matt, just in time.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.684
Six weeks early,
no prenatal care.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.119
You have a boy.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.320
First thing,
get rid of the gunk

09:13.353 --> 09:14.955
and dry him like crazy.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.023
Warms the baby
and reminds him to breathe.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.958
( speaking Chinese )

09:17.991 --> 09:19.359
Good pulse but the cry's weak.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.061
With neonates, it's all
about ventilation.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.130
Get them to breathe well
and the rest will follow.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.632
Decel down to the 20s..

09:24.632 --> 09:25.265
You got it--
one more big push.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.767
Hand me the bag.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.035
Come on, you can do
better than that.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.036
Wake up!
Matt!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.370
Head's out, here we go.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.371
We were visiting
my cousin.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.372
Baby come too soon.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.074
Don't worry, Dad.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.643
Just needs
a little help
getting started here.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.344
32-weekers usually do
just fine.
Matt!

09:37.377 --> 09:38.746
Cord clamps.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.213
Dude, thanks for
the heads up.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.915
We would have brought
down a second team.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.116
Neela,
second set-up.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.752
The ABCs...
you know what to do.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.287
Okay, buddy, you just bought
yourself a tube.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.289
Call the NICU for back up.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.324
It's a girl.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.362
This baby's not breathing.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.766
RAAB:
A NICU admission

09:58.799 --> 10:01.268
is like running a marathon
without training for it.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.403
It's an endurance test
for patients,

10:03.436 --> 10:06.139
for families and for you.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.041
Eat when you can,
sleep when you can,

10:08.075 --> 10:09.677
and when it's
time to go home,

10:09.710 --> 10:12.145
get the hell
out of here.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.415
Let's round.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.151
Jiang Han's
up to 1830 grams.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.920
Room air, q3 feeds.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.756
GROUP:
* Blessed be
the tie that binds... *

10:22.790 --> 10:24.725
RAAB:
Feeder and grower.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.694
Behaving himself
nicely.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.261
VIRGIE:
Inga's ABG.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.798
Sister's a mess.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.766
( singing continues )
Inga?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.969
Inga?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.437
You had a week to
come up with nicknames,

10:37.470 --> 10:38.739
and you failed to.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.073
Dirk and Inga.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.274
I was going to
call her Surinder.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.375
It's Punjabi
for "warrior."

10:42.409 --> 10:43.443
You're thinking
too much.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.778
Inga doesn't
sound tough.

10:44.812 --> 10:48.248
Neela,
present your patient.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.950
Her pneumonia is worse.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.018
RAAB:
Acidotic.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.352
Ventilation's crap.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.221
VIRGIE:
Pa02 in the 40s all day.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.356
I think
we should consider ECMO.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.127
Cardiopulmonary bypass?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.730
Isn't that
incredibly dangerous

11:02.763 --> 11:03.831
on a two-kilo kid?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.098
We need to
do something

11:05.132 --> 11:06.099
before the
prolonged hypoxia

11:06.133 --> 11:07.367
causes brain damage.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.302
Who can tell me
the risk of ECMO?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.871
Overwhelming infection.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.840
Could happen anyway,
ECMO or not.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.307
Head bleed.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.943
Parents could end up
with a little potato.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.277
We'll get daily
head ultrasounds.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.779
That won't
prevent a bleed,

11:18.812 --> 11:20.213
just detect it
after the fact.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.749
She was doing well
until she became bacteremic.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.016
I know it's risky,

11:23.050 --> 11:24.251
but ECMO
could get her through this.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.253
She's not getting enough oxygen.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.055
If we do nothing, she'll die.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.222
Are you sure?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.423
How can anyone
be sure

11:30.457 --> 11:31.959
about something
like that?

11:33.293 --> 11:36.263
Neela, call the profusion team
to start ECMO.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.765
Rounds are over.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.834
Thanks.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.402
She already thinks
I'm an idiot,

11:42.435 --> 11:44.371
so there's really
nothing to lose.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.773
I have your sign-out.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.340
You should get out of here.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.476
I need to talk to Inga's
parents about ECMO.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.278
I'm going to be here
all night anyway.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.445
Go. I'll talk to them.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.783
No. I'll do it.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.417
Did you change
Rocky's diaper?

11:57.450 --> 11:58.786
Yeah.

11:58.786 --> 11:59.820
Why did you do that?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.021
'Cause it was dirty.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.091
My ins and outs
are all off now.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.959
All right. I'm sorry.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.460
Not good enough; go find it.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.429
It's in the trash.
Find it, weigh it,

12:09.462 --> 12:12.299
and I just might
let you get some
sleep tonight.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.270
Mr. and Mrs. Tseng...

12:17.304 --> 12:20.040
Sorry. Do you have
the results back

12:20.073 --> 12:21.474
on the cardiac cath?

12:21.508 --> 12:23.110
I'm sure Cards will
come talk to you

12:23.143 --> 12:24.812
as soon as they have
an official report.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.013
I've been waiting for hours.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.180
I'll take an unofficial report.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.182
I'll ask Abby
if she's heard.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.984
I need to
talk to you.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.185
Waiting's driving
me crazy.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.486
The waiting is hard.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.188
Do you know how long
it takes to recover

12:35.222 --> 12:36.356
from something like this?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.524
Just, you know,
rough estimate?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.859
It's too soon to say.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.093
Would you two come with me?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.997
How long you been here?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.165
Eight days.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.200
We were visiting
from Suzhou, China,

12:47.234 --> 12:48.535
when the babies came.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.970
Are they doing okay?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.204
Our son is very strong.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.340
Mr. Tseng?

13:01.414 --> 13:04.517
ECMO stands for Extra Corporal
Membrane Oxygenation.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.986
Ready for circuit.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.587
The machine puts oxygen
in the blood

13:07.620 --> 13:09.222
and sends it back
to Inga's body.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.225
It does the work of
her heart and lungs.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.927
Let's go.
I'm clamped on high.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.128
I know it looks scary,

13:15.162 --> 13:16.997
but it's her
best chance.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.198
Chance of what?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.399
A good outcome.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.201
She'll be healthy?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.569
I hope so.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.037
TOM:
Chow time for Dirk.

13:24.071 --> 13:24.571
One of you
want to feed him?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.074
I'll go.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.241
JANE:
I've got control down low.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.978
Releasing arterial.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.880
Releasing venous.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.381
Clamping bridge.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.250
ECMO on, 2025.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.487
It'll be while before we know
how she's going to respond.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.555
I'll let you know.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.967
MEI FAN:
If she was born in China,

13:54.001 --> 13:56.536
she'd already be dead.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.272
You don't know that.

13:59.306 --> 14:02.042
My husband and I are lucky.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.245
We went to school,
we have jobs as teachers.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.982
But it's not like here.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.219
We wanted our daughter
to be born in America,

14:12.252 --> 14:15.288
so she'd have more options.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.424
And she already does.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.130
We don't have hospitals
like this.

14:23.163 --> 14:27.434
It wasn't an accident, then.
You meant to deliver here.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.239
We sold everything
to come stay with my aunt,

14:32.272 --> 14:35.542
have the babies in Chicago.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.611
You're just going to start over,
with nothing?

14:40.480 --> 14:42.549
Her life will be better.

14:45.018 --> 14:48.088
Isn't that why your parents
sent you to this country, too?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.096
Tom, can you help me out?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.998
Not now.
Gotta hang vanco.

14:58.031 --> 15:02.035
( sighing ):
Transducers, art lines,
no butterflies.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.337
They're in the cabinet
by the sinks

15:04.371 --> 15:06.306
on the left.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.242
Been here for nine weeks.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.543
Thanks.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.715
Hi.
Hi.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.717
Just came to check
on Jacob.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.719
He looks great.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.354
Mm-hmm.
His suck is still weak,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.190
but Abby tells me
to keep trying.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.291
He'll get there.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.692
You keep trying.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.360
It says here that
he may need surgery

15:27.394 --> 15:29.329
again in a few years--
is that true?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.364
That sounds like
a question for cardiology.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.665
Occasionally the area

15:32.699 --> 15:34.367
where the aorta
was repaired

15:34.401 --> 15:36.136
gets blocked from scarring,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.005
but usually they can take care
of it in the cath lab

15:38.038 --> 15:39.372
and avoid another surgery.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.208
That's good to know.
Thanks, Abby.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.444
I better get back to work.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.379
But I'll be by later.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
It was nice to see you,
Mrs. Kolber.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.222
Looks like you're
doing well here.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.589
Right.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.491
Abby, take a look
at the CO2.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.394
Uh, back off on the rate
and check it again
in an hour.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.030
You got it.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.399
The parents love you.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.201
Nurses wouldn't give you
the time of day

16:08.235 --> 16:10.137
unless they thought you knew
what you were doing.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.204
Yeah.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.205
Tell that to my attending.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.206
You should see me on rounds.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.408
( chuckles )

16:15.442 --> 16:17.444
So Kem and I had our

16:17.477 --> 16:20.347
first official tour
of the labor and
delivery suites today.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.415
How can you call one room
a suite?

16:22.449 --> 16:25.152
That counting the bathroom?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.586
Ah.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.624
You're gonna be a dad.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.394
Yeah.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.363
How's it feel?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.231
Scary.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.502
Especially in this room.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.671
I start thinking about all
the things that can go wrong,

16:44.704 --> 16:47.807
all the mistakes you can make.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.444
You're going to be
a great father.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.246
VIRGIE:
Full term forceps
in two!

16:55.582 --> 16:57.317
That's my cue.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.454
Hey, Abby...

17:01.488 --> 17:04.424
...you're going to be
a great doctor.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.462
Okay... Let's go. Baby time.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.098
Can't-- Got a finger in this
kid's pleural cavity. You go.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.366
Alone?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.666
Is that even legal?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.103
I'm right behind you.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.337
Get set up,
I'll meet you there.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.570
I'll go with you.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.207
Are you kidding?
You have to go home.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.374
You can't go to a delivery
on your own.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.710
I dream about blood sugars,

17:23.742 --> 17:27.180
TPN orders, gent doses,
boxed kidneys.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.416
Better get used to it
if you're going into
neonatology.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.351
I haven't slept well
for days.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.486
You know, all this
whining about how
tired you are,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.488
but you never leave.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.424
I hate to break it
to you, Neela,

17:37.457 --> 17:39.459
but we will make it
through this night
without you.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.660
Just trying to help.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.163
( woman groans and pants )

17:43.196 --> 17:44.164
( woman screaming )

17:44.197 --> 17:45.698
ALYSHA:
NICU's here.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.402
35 weeker, maternal diabetes,
failure to progress.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.670
I thought this was just
a forceps delivery.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.339
That, too.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.506
Here comes
a contraction, Sarah.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.142
( screaming )

17:55.175 --> 17:56.676
That's it, baby. Big push!
We're almost there!

17:56.709 --> 17:58.211
What do you mean "we"?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.513
Hi, I'm Abby from the NICU team.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.149
Is there something wrong?

18:02.149 --> 18:03.483
We're called in
for all forcep deliveries.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.584
It's standard procedure.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.618
Baby's heart
rate's dropping.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.853
( screaming )

18:06.886 --> 18:08.255
REITMAN:
Come on, let's go!

18:08.288 --> 18:09.489
The baby's
getting tired!

18:09.522 --> 18:10.490
SARAH:
Oh, she's not the only one.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.391
ALYSHA:
Nuchal cord.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.526
Bad decel, 54.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.794
REITMAN:
Okay, Sarah, one more.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.563
( screaming )
That's it.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.531
Here she comes.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.832
Okay, Sarah,
one more.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.169
( screaming )

18:22.169 --> 18:23.570
That's it.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.804
Here she comes.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.906
( screaming ):
A girl?!

18:26.939 --> 18:28.341
It's a girl?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.709
It's a girl!

18:29.742 --> 18:30.910
It's a girl!

18:30.943 --> 18:32.345
Good work, baby.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.414
( laughing )
Good work.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.184
Poor tone.
Check the heart rate.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.819
I can't feel it.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.554
Well, listen, then.
Shallow resps.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.556
FATHER:
How is she? How's my girl?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.592
Come on, baby...
wake up.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
Wake up.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.196
Hold on, I'm gonna
get a picture...

18:49.229 --> 18:51.198
Neela, what's the pulse?
I'm counting.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.832
It's not that hard.
Tap it out.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.369
Where the hell is Matt?

18:56.403 --> 18:58.205
Wow, look at
all that hair.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.740
I'm sorry, I'm going
to need some room, okay?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.575
Okay.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.945
( baby crying loudly )

19:05.978 --> 19:07.214
She's okay.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.615
You hear that, baby?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.716
She got some lungs.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.950
ALYSHA:
Everything cool?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.220
Yeah.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.754
She's gonna have to
come upstairs to
monitor her sugars,

19:14.787 --> 19:18.358
but, yeah,
she looks good.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.427
Congratulations.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.828
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.731
Ooh, girl, you look
just like your daddy.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.434
Except you're three
shades lighter.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.669
Babies are supposed to
be light when they're
born-- I told you.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.239
Don't listen to
your daddy, Daphne.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.441
You're perfect.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.244
( pager beeping )

19:37.277 --> 19:39.246
It's Matt.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.813
He's a little late.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.383
It's Inga.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.788
What happened?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.323
Hypertensive.
Crit bottomed out.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.691
Ultrasound shows
huge brain bleed.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.260
Are you sure?!

19:53.293 --> 19:54.494
Yeah, like we said,

19:54.527 --> 19:55.528
it's always a risk
with ECMO.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.496
She's got to come off.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.265
But she'll die.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.899
Well, we can't leave her on,
the bleed will get worse.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.334
Hey, Matt,
they need you in L&D.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.703
Ah, there's a C-section.
I gotta go.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.305
Um, order 20 per kilo
of packed cells.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.374
I'll be back soon.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.775
Surgery's on their way
to decannulate.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.244
I talked everyone
into this.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.280
Nobody, not even you,
could talk Raab into ECMO

20:13.313 --> 20:14.747
if she didn't think
it was the right thing.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.483
NEELA:
She's seizing.
Point five of ativan.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.585
I can't take a verbal
for a benzo from a med student.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.620
Raab's gone and Matt's
in a delivery.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.988
Give her the ativan.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.456
I could lose my job.
She's seizing.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.324
That's the least
of our worries.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.692
Let's just wait

20:25.725 --> 20:26.993
to see what Matt says
when he comes back.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.728
Versed will do
the same thing.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.562
You can't give that
without a co-signed order.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.597
Watch me.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.631
I'm telling Dr. Raab.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.266
You do that.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.801
She'll kick you guys
off the rotation.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.404
She can kick me off.
Neela has nothing to do with it.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.439
What am I going to
tell her parents?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.443
Versed's in.

20:45.545 --> 20:46.879
You should go home.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.448
Mr. and Mrs. Tseng,
I'm sorry.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.283
I screwed up.
Inga's brain is toast.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.418
Stop it.
You didn't do this.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.619
I've got to call them.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.786
Just go.
Raab'll do it.

20:53.820 --> 20:54.921
They should hear it from me.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.423
You know, you're a med student.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.290
I think the attending
can handle it.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.591
Just go.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.466
Good night, Neela.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.843
( gasping )

21:19.746 --> 21:22.715
Excuse me, can someone
get the door, please?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.017
Hello? Anyone?

21:27.954 --> 21:30.923
Get me the hell out of here!

21:37.764 --> 21:39.432
Oxygen is perfect

21:39.466 --> 21:40.700
the whole time.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.001
When can we
take Dirk home?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.736
As soon
as Dr. Raab writes her note.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.872
Thank you,
Neela.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.675
Inga's not breathing
over her ventilator at all.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.109
That's not a good
sign, is it?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.844
It will take time
before we know

21:51.878 --> 21:54.614
how much neurological function
she'll get back,

21:54.647 --> 21:56.749
but her lungs are much better.

21:56.783 --> 21:57.984
She's a strong girl.
Yes, she is.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.452
I'm still waiting for you

21:59.486 --> 22:00.753
to fill out Dirk's
discharge summary.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.054
I'll get on that.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.691
Cher's a lovely name,
it's just, uh,

22:04.724 --> 22:06.526
h-how you've spelled it.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.027
I just wanted
it to be different.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.763
Okay.

22:10.797 --> 22:13.800
As long as you're aware.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.468
Poor Chair-- she's doomed.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.637
Unless she meets a
nice ottoman some day.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.772
Heard any funny dead
baby stories lately?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.107
Here's a good one:

22:21.140 --> 22:22.942
Inga's hydrocephalus
is worsening.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.445
EEG shows continued
seizure activity.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.980
She's not dead,
but she might never wake up.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.516
It's a real laugh.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.552
Bad day, Neela?

22:32.585 --> 22:34.687
Millions of dollars
keeping these babies alive.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.788
Half of them die anyway.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.790
Why bother?

22:37.824 --> 22:40.092
Time for rounds.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.561
40 years ago,

22:41.594 --> 22:44.797
Inga was considered
a micro-preemie,

22:44.831 --> 22:46.466
borderline viable.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.967
In many parts of the world,
that's still the case.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.669
And we saved her

22:49.702 --> 22:51.170
so she can endure a
lifetime of seizures,

22:51.203 --> 22:52.972
chronic lung disease,
cerebral palsy.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.741
It's a real advance.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.142
We gave Inga a chance.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.546
Her brother's going home today,
a normal kid.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.813
But Inga's here now,

23:00.847 --> 23:02.549
gorked out in a
level three nursery.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.050
Look, we do our best.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.818
Some kids will end up

23:05.852 --> 23:07.454
hospitalized

23:07.454 --> 23:09.822
for life, and some will go
to the prom.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.458
Neela,

23:11.458 --> 23:12.124
there are no
guarantees
in this work.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.159
If you can't

23:13.192 --> 23:14.461
live with that, I'd suggest

23:14.494 --> 23:15.528
you become a bank teller.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.929
( pager beeping )

23:16.963 --> 23:17.964
We'll pick up again
when I get back.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.131
Don't listen to her.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.700
My cousin's a bank teller.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.935
Got held up
at gun point last year.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.040
Still here?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.509
I discharged Daphne
an hour ago.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.843
Yeah, we're just waiting

23:30.877 --> 23:32.512
for the nurse
to take out that IV.

23:32.545 --> 23:33.913
LOCKHART:
I can to it.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.648
You're letting
a med student
touch your IV?

23:35.682 --> 23:36.849
That's brave.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.785
She's territorial.

23:38.818 --> 23:40.520
They teach that
in nursing school.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.721
TOM:
Abby,

23:41.754 --> 23:43.523
we need you
over here.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.792
Just keep some
pressure there.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.527
Okay.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.228
Come on, come on.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.597
She's going to miss you guys.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.698
RASGOTRA:
No, she won't.

23:51.731 --> 23:52.965
She'll be home.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.233
TOM:
He's been tachypnic

23:54.266 --> 23:55.234
all morning,
sat's dropping.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.536
He's tiring out.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.904
You put him back on oh-two?

23:57.937 --> 23:58.871
He's going to need
more than that.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.106
( alarms )

24:00.139 --> 24:01.608
Diastolic is
in the teens.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.042
Widening pulse pressure.
He's septic.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.544
Okay, 50cc's of saline,

24:04.577 --> 24:06.579
cultures, start him
on amp and cefotax.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.080
What's happening, Abby?
( alarm )

24:08.114 --> 24:09.081
TOM:
He's apneic.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.750
Pulse down to 105.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.084
Bag him.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.853
TOM:
Five As and Bs
in the last hour.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.087
Did anybody page Raab?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.523
911.
Okay, Mrs. Kolber...
Kyle?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.590
Jacob's blood pressure
has dropped.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.891
He's having trouble breathing,

24:18.925 --> 24:20.259
most likely due
to a blood infection.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.694
From what?
We're sending out cultures.

24:21.728 --> 24:22.929
We won't know
for a few days.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.764
He was okay
this morning.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.265
Sepsis can come on
quickly like this.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.134
We're starting antibiotics
to fight the infection,

24:28.167 --> 24:30.570
but we're going to have to put
the breathing tube back in.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.838
We were talking
about going home.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.005
He's a tough guy.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.874
He'll get through this.

24:34.907 --> 24:35.808
Get together.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.777
Photo for the wall.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.845
Smile.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.714
Fentanyl's in.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.784
Go ahead, Abby.

24:50.757 --> 24:51.791
One more with Dr. Neela.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.892
Oh, it's okay.

24:52.925 --> 24:53.960
SHUANG:
We insist.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.629
Neela?

24:56.663 --> 24:57.797
Suction.

24:57.830 --> 24:58.965
Take your time.

24:58.998 --> 24:59.999
Heart rate's good.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.233
Smile.

25:08.975 --> 25:12.244
I see the cords. Tube.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.713
Good-bye, Jiang Han.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.716
Ready to see
the outside world?

25:16.749 --> 25:19.018
We're going
to keep calling him Dirk

25:19.051 --> 25:21.621
since the name has
bring him luck.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.656
Thank you, Dr. Neela.

25:24.591 --> 25:25.758
Mei Fan,

25:25.792 --> 25:28.695
( speaking Chinese )

25:35.935 --> 25:38.070
( sighs )

25:42.675 --> 25:44.744
Mei Fan?

25:45.778 --> 25:48.781
( baby crying )

25:54.020 --> 25:55.988
I want you to have this.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.624
Thanks.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.358
It's strange to be going.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.027
Lots of parents are nervous

26:01.060 --> 26:03.029
when their babies
are discharged.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.230
It'll be great.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.265
You'll love
having him home.

26:06.298 --> 26:10.236
I know you're right.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.738
Bye, Neela.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.940
See you tomorrow.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.853
TOM:
What are my
vent settings?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.688
RAAB:
24 over eight. We'll
adjust from there.

26:28.721 --> 26:31.691
Order a versed drip
and a chest film.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.092
You want to call the tech?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.161
RAAB:
Okay, nothing
to do now but wait

26:35.194 --> 26:37.163
for the antibiotics
to kick in.

26:38.831 --> 26:42.034
I don't know if I can take
another round of this.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.239
( softly crying )

26:49.008 --> 26:50.843
Here. Sit.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.323
One of those better be for me.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.993
I just needed to get outside
for a minute.

27:07.026 --> 27:10.730
The NICU's so confining,
claustrophobic.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.733
There's a reason why Matt
calls it the "the box".

27:13.766 --> 27:15.301
Raab's right, you know.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.904
Did you eat anything?

27:17.937 --> 27:20.272
I like science,
complete answers,

27:20.306 --> 27:21.908
a plan for everything.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.243
I can't deal
with uncertainty.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.412
It gets easier.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.048
I'd sort of planned
neonatology since I
started medical school.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.117
I'm supposed to
be loving this.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.452
Well... the whole purpose
of rotation

27:33.485 --> 27:35.454
is to try on
different specialties.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.724
I mean, it's okay
if you don't...

27:37.724 --> 27:39.091
I had a baby brother.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.194
He died when he
was six days old.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.163
I was only three.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.465
Oh.

27:46.498 --> 27:51.203
I remember sitting in my mom's
hospital room eating ice cream.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.940
But I don't actually
remember him.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.045
The NICU's just so
sad all the time.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.246
How can you stand it?

28:02.081 --> 28:04.250
I don't know.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.786
When I was an OB nurse
the preemies freaked me out,

28:06.819 --> 28:08.287
thought they looked
like frogs.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.790
I was pretty sure
I was going to hate the NICU.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.424
But you don't.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.796
No, I don't.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.168
It's not just about the babies.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.937
You know, so much of it is about
taking care of the parents.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.506
And it turns out...
( pager beeping )

28:27.539 --> 28:30.409
tragic family dynamics
are my specialty.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.814
It's Matt.
There's a delivery.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.215
MATT:
Full term,

28:36.248 --> 28:38.985
mom's febrile,
P-PROM, suspected chorio.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.820
REITMAN:
Good work, Sandy.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.221
Oh, my God.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.791
We're almost there.
Honey, we're almost there.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.828
LOPEZ:
The little boy is
officially here.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.830
( joyful crying )

28:50.863 --> 28:52.331
You did it.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.833
We have a baby.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.301
MARINA:
Amniotic fluid's cloudy,

28:55.334 --> 28:56.903
kid's had late variables.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.810
Abby?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.078
Wait, you're
bagging him?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.847
Sorry, you need to
wait over there.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.849
No, that's my son.
I'm a doctor.

29:09.882 --> 29:10.950
It's okay, Matt.
It's okay.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.318
Honey, what's wrong?

29:12.351 --> 29:14.821
It's just a little blow-by.
Let them work.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.823
What's wrong?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.061
He's too quiet.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.830
Give him a minute.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.398
Good chest excursion.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.367
( baby crying )

29:28.400 --> 29:31.337
Thank you very much.
That's what we like to hear.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.473
Congratulations, Mom.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.142
And Mom.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.579
He's beautiful.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.849
Is he really all right?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.884
He'll have to go upstairs
for antibiotics

29:44.917 --> 29:46.252
because of the chorio.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.354
But right now,
he looks great.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.289
I love you.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.193
Hello, little baby.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.330
I had no idea.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.167
Nobody did.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.435
Would you like to cut
the cord, Dr. Weaver?

30:03.469 --> 30:06.372
( sniffles )

30:08.875 --> 30:12.411
( baby crying )

30:16.983 --> 30:18.951
( mouths ):
Hello, Henry.

30:51.650 --> 30:53.886
Hey.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.887
Your usual.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.522
Thank you.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.158
Bad night?

30:59.191 --> 31:01.493
Jake is maxed out
on dopa and epi,

31:01.527 --> 31:02.929
third-spacing like mad.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.230
In the last two hours

31:04.263 --> 31:05.531
his belly blew up
in front of our eyes.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.632
I think it's NEC.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.067
Surgery's on their way.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.169
God. His parents here?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.038
No, they're on their way.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.472
I finally convinced them to
go home and get some rest,

31:13.505 --> 31:15.474
and then I had to call
them back an hour later.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.443
Any word
from Inga's parents?

31:17.476 --> 31:18.945
No.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.113
Three days and not
a single phone call.

31:21.147 --> 31:22.548
KUB on Jake Kolber.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.216
Free air under the diaphragm
and pneumatosis.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.952
Oh, damn it. He's perfed.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.253
Pedes surgery's
going to meet us
in the O.R.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.621
Come on.
Let's go.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.491
Can we wait
for his parents?

31:32.524 --> 31:34.093
They should see him
before he goes up.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.494
His bowel's dying--
there isn't time.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.096
We need to save
the viable tissue

31:37.129 --> 31:39.966
before there's
nothing left to save.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.467
He's thrombocytopenic.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.471
Platelets and FFP are
onboard in the O.R.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.506
Abby, wh-where are you going?

31:47.539 --> 31:49.441
To surgery.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.110
His intestines were injured
as a result of the infection,

31:51.143 --> 31:52.478
and they need to cut
out the injured part.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.580
I'm Dr. Corday.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.216
The injury has compromised
your son's already
tenuous condition.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.517
The sooner we get him
to the O.R., the better.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.219
Okay.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.022
Hey. Would you like

32:03.055 --> 32:05.424
to see your little
brother up close?

32:06.358 --> 32:07.459
Abby.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.095
Kids aren't allowed in NICU.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.396
Just five seconds.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.667
There he is.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.139
Can he hear me?

32:20.172 --> 32:21.440
Yes, he can.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.547
It's okay. You won't hurt him.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.688
I'm Miranda, your big sister.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.363
Come on, honey.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.604
Thank you, Abby.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.041
Thank you.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.162
Good morning.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.496
Morning.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.066
Where is everyone?

33:22.134 --> 33:24.070
I told them not to come.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.210
I think he's getting
a diaper rash.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.746
I'll order some nystatin.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.625
He's three
months old today.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.095
You should go home.

33:55.534 --> 34:02.841
I thought that... if
I prayed hard enough...

34:02.874 --> 34:05.377
if I showed God
how much I believed.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.613
You must be exhausted.

34:12.583 --> 34:16.788
I don't want him
to suffer anymore.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.194
My patient has been bumped
three times

34:22.228 --> 34:23.829
for so-called emergencies.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.764
Been waiting over 24 hours
for ORIF, happened again.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.134
Came up here to see
what's so damn important.

34:28.134 --> 34:31.536
Jake Kolber.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.505
It's the congenital heart
disease baby

34:33.539 --> 34:35.641
you guys admitted to us
a few weeks ago.

34:35.674 --> 34:36.675
Do you remember?

34:36.708 --> 34:39.210
No.

34:39.245 --> 34:41.213
SURGEON:
Circumferential necrosis
to the jejunum.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.882
There's really
nothing viable here.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.386
Damn.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.587
Abby?

34:48.620 --> 34:50.589
The bowel's completely
infarcted.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.424
I'm sorry.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.592
We're closing.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.837
So that's it.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.476
Can't live without a gut.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.846
I'm sorry.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.554
( groans )

35:22.588 --> 35:23.722
Where you going?

35:23.755 --> 35:25.191
I'm going to go
tell the family.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.525
Just give yourself
a minute, okay?

35:26.558 --> 35:28.360
They don't need
to hear this immediately.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.296
What am I supposed to do,
go out and get a latte

35:30.329 --> 35:32.431
while they stand out there
wondering what's going on?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.300
All right, listen.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.735
Maybe you want to wait for
the attending to tell them.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.437
Is that what you would do?

35:51.783 --> 35:53.352
Kyle.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.755
( crying )

35:59.558 --> 36:01.727
( crying ):
Oh, God.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.612
Is this the Chinese interpreter?

36:20.646 --> 36:23.282
Excuse me.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.884
No, I don't understand
what you're saying.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.455
I've already called them.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.524
I was connected to you.

36:32.558 --> 36:36.928
Please don't put me
on hold again.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.281
Hello?

36:55.314 --> 36:58.284
Yes, I'm still here.

36:58.284 --> 37:01.287
I'm not sure
if I need Mandarin or Cantonese.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.775
How long will it take?

37:56.808 --> 37:59.010
An hour, maybe longer.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.450
( sighs )

38:04.483 --> 38:06.418
You helped this family, Abby.

38:06.452 --> 38:10.356
They will remember you
for the rest of their lives.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.590
Yeah.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.924
I'm hoping you'll give

38:12.958 --> 38:15.794
neonatology serious
consideration.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.498
Are you mocking me?

38:19.531 --> 38:21.733
Cause it's really,
really not a good time.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.836
No.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.739
You're one of the best students
I've ever had.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.614
Thank you.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.416
Bye.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.918
What?

38:39.951 --> 38:42.120
The Tsengs have gone back
to China with Dirk.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.722
What?

38:43.755 --> 38:44.756
That was Mrs. Tseng's cousin.

38:44.790 --> 38:45.991
They went back yesterday.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.093
She doesn't know
how to reach them.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.496
Come on. We've
got work to do.

38:50.529 --> 38:53.932
Tell me this is our last day.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.139
Good morning.
How's Henry today?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.641
He's great.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.875
He's raring to get
out of here.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.644
All the cultures
came back negative,

39:05.677 --> 39:07.646
but we still need to treat
for another seven days.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.148
Unless you two allow
us to do the LP.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.950
I do taps on babies
all day in the E.R.,

39:11.983 --> 39:13.585
and never think twice about it.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.754
Honey, shh.
Just do the spinal tap.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.889
We want to take our baby home.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.525
Okay. Abby, you're on.

39:19.558 --> 39:20.559
Okay.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.428
Uh, Dr. Raab,

39:22.461 --> 39:23.795
I would be much
more comfortable

39:23.829 --> 39:25.664
if you did the procedure,
if you don't mind.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.633
No problem.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.000
I'll be back after rounds.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.101
Okay, thanks.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.704
Let Abby do it.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.172
Kerry...

39:34.205 --> 39:35.941
It's okay, Sandy.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.686
Dr. Raab, what's going
to happen to Inga?

39:47.719 --> 39:50.021
If she survives,
she'll either be adopted

39:50.055 --> 39:52.458
or put in a long-term
care facility.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.959
Should I call social work?

39:53.992 --> 39:56.027
Go ahead, but nobody's going
to China to look for them.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.563
This doesn't make sense.

39:57.596 --> 39:58.830
Her mother wouldn't
just leave her here.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.699
They're young.
They're scared.

40:00.732 --> 40:02.468
Maybe they think Inga would
be better off this way.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.902
In a hospital, alone?

40:03.935 --> 40:06.137
If you were in a foreign
country, with no money,

40:06.171 --> 40:08.507
no job, and no place
to live, who knows?

40:08.540 --> 40:09.908
You might do the same thing.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.977
No, I wouldn't
and neither would you.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.212
You can't begin to know
what you would do

40:14.245 --> 40:15.781
in the same situation,

40:15.814 --> 40:18.149
and you don't know
the first thing about me.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.818
People are complicated.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.887
That's not an excuse
for abandoning a baby.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.722
Neela, if you stay
that judgmental,

40:23.755 --> 40:25.791
you're going to hate this job.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.660
( fussing softly )

40:30.261 --> 40:31.763
( sighs )

40:31.797 --> 40:33.198
CSF on the first attempt

40:33.231 --> 40:35.634
with Dr. Mom breathing
down your neck.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.168
I'm impressed.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.171
You should see how good I am
when I'm not post-call.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.673
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.174
You stuck a needle
in my kid's back

40:43.208 --> 40:45.043
and you've been working
for 36 hours?

40:45.076 --> 40:47.713
Actually,
it's only been 31 hours.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.715
Tube four, crystal clear.

40:49.748 --> 40:51.149
( cries )

40:51.182 --> 40:53.885
Owen Miller. Bad hypoxic
brain injury at birth.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.887
Mom's your real patient.

40:55.921 --> 40:56.788
She's inching towards
letting go, needs
a lot of help.

40:56.822 --> 40:57.823
Mrs. Miller,

40:57.856 --> 40:59.057
this is David.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.826
Hi. I'm your new medical
student.

41:00.859 --> 41:03.194
Ex 34 weeker with mec asp
and pneumomediastinum.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.196
Got him off high frequency
last night.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.532
That's a big step.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.733
"Mec asp"?

41:07.766 --> 41:08.900
Meconium aspiration.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.602
It's like a foreign language,

41:10.636 --> 41:12.003
but you'll pick it up fast.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.171
Zero red blood cells.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.940
Champagne tap.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.543
Hey, before we go,
do you mind taking a picture?

41:19.177 --> 41:21.212
Thank you.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.549
( contended sigh )

41:26.051 --> 41:27.218
Thanks.

41:27.252 --> 41:28.620
Get your butt back down

41:28.654 --> 41:30.221
to the E.R.
where you belong.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.557
Bye.
Bye.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.758
Congratulations.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.259
Thanks.
Thanks.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.252
( snap )

42:08.293 --> 42:09.260
You all signed out?

42:09.294 --> 42:12.330
Yeah.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.800
Ever been to the Sky Bar?

42:14.833 --> 42:16.768
( coughing )

42:16.802 --> 42:19.037
This is disgusting.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.906
I told you.

42:20.939 --> 42:23.041
Why are cigars associated
with babies?

42:23.074 --> 42:24.943
This stinky thing really
has no place in a nursery.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.778
It's Freudian.

42:26.812 --> 42:29.214
Something about men wanting
to have sex with their mothers.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.281
Thank you.

42:30.315 --> 42:31.817
( chuckles )

42:31.850 --> 42:33.251
You know what
else I don't get?

42:33.284 --> 42:35.020
Why we're drinking cider
instead of champagne.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.287
You're supposed
to get champagne
for a champagne tap.

42:36.321 --> 42:37.723
Is Weaver that cheap?

42:37.756 --> 42:40.291
Weaver knows
I don't drink champagne.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.028
So, you still thinking
about neonatology?

42:43.061 --> 42:44.763
Not in a million years.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.299
I hope you didn't let
Raab discourage you.

42:48.333 --> 42:51.637
It's more than that.

42:51.670 --> 42:54.239
She thinks you should go
into NICU, you know.

42:55.741 --> 42:57.242
Yeah.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.277
You should.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.916
No, thanks.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.986
I bet every attending
tries to recruit you.

43:08.019 --> 43:09.320
( chuckles ):
Oh, please.

43:09.354 --> 43:10.388
Look who's talking.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.857
Your mind is a sponge.

43:11.890 --> 43:17.128
Maybe, but... you've
got that thing.

43:19.164 --> 43:23.201
I don't know what it is,
but it's much harder to learn.

43:26.371 --> 43:30.676
I think all that cider's
going to your head.
