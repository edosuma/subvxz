00:06.840 --> 00:08.090
- Hey.
- Okay, tell her.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.218
Tell your sister
what you just told me.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.095
I'm not going
to the stupid prom.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.431
[gasps]

00:14.514 --> 00:16.015
What, what about
your memories?

00:16.099 --> 00:17.726
- What about your prom memories?
- No, thanks.

00:17.809 --> 00:19.519
I'm not spending
a million dollars

00:19.602 --> 00:22.647
to go to a prom with a guy
who only comes up to my boobs

00:22.731 --> 00:24.941
and then watch
some lame Barbie doll couple

00:25.024 --> 00:26.317
who everybody
secretly hates

00:26.401 --> 00:29.571
get crowned king
and freakin' queen.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.448
Why are you being
all mean about the queen?

00:31.531 --> 00:35.452
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure
you were a wonderful queen.

00:35.535 --> 00:36.995
- You were queen?
- Mm-hmm.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.498
Oh! Guess what I was at my prom.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.751
Not asked.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.085
This may be hard to believe

00:44.169 --> 00:46.796
but I did not
always look like this.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.131
In high school

00:48.214 --> 00:51.342
I was considered
big-boned and jelly-like.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.220
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.181
I was a big 'un.

00:56.264 --> 00:59.350
No, no, this is an invitation
to Rick and Julie's wedding.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.811
Hmm. That's weird.
Doesn't Julie hate your guts?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.980
Well, not all my guts.

01:05.063 --> 01:08.109
Just the part of your guts
that love Rick?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.820
We're just friends,
but Julie doesn't believe that

01:10.904 --> 01:12.155
which is why
she wants me and Rick

01:12.238 --> 01:13.615
to have no contact ever.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.034
Isn't a wedding invitation
contact?

01:16.868 --> 01:18.077
Exactly.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.704
But if they sent
the invitations out

01:19.788 --> 01:22.582
before the no-contact rule,
then this was a mistake.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.083
Oh, yeah.

01:24.167 --> 01:28.797
Okay, it was sent
March 20, crap.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.382
It's smudged.
I can't tell. Damn.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.051
Well, who cares
when it was sent?

01:33.134 --> 01:35.178
You're not going to the wedding
either way, right?

01:35.261 --> 01:38.056
Well, you know, Holly,
it's not quite that simple.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.017
Rick and I have been
friends since high school.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.645
Maybe Julie
understands that now

01:43.728 --> 01:45.688
and this is
a peace offering, yeah.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.442
And, and if I don't respond,
then, then I look rude.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.195
But if it was sent out

01:52.278 --> 01:54.531
before the no-contact rule
as a mistake

01:54.614 --> 01:57.575
and then she responds,
she looks like a big loser.

01:59.577 --> 02:03.039
But now I'll never know
because of the smudge.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.625
You know what this is?
This is just sloppy postal work.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.045
Uh-oh. Poor prom queen
has a dilemma.

Oh, I am so over prom.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.263
I just wanna get
out of high school

as fast as possible.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.100
Is that gonna be part
of your valedictorian speech?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.269
- Huh. Valedictorian.
- I know.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.187
[laughing]
I know.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.858
Seriously, if I could
just get that internship

03:11.941 --> 03:14.235
and go to Paris,
my life would be beautiful.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.321
No more Vince,
no more Henry.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.614
Wait, I thought
you liked Henry again.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.741
No! He has a girlfriend.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.200
What if he didn't?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.452
He does.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.454
Listen, Henry
is one of my best friends

03:24.537 --> 03:26.289
and if it weren't for him
helping me with my essay

03:26.372 --> 03:28.958
I wouldn't even have
the chance to go to Paris.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.168
He's a great guy, you know

03:30.251 --> 03:32.962
but maybe for a second,
I thought maybe

03:33.046 --> 03:37.800
but he has a girlfriend,
and I'm happy for him.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.136
Okay, I get it.
You don't like Henry.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.512
So what about Vince?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.182
Oh, please.
That was just an infatuation.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.351
Every girl has had a Vince.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.729
Actually, that was the problem.
Every girl has had Vince.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.314
So what you're saying is
you don't like Vince

03:51.397 --> 03:52.607
and you don't like Henry.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.276
Yes! Yes! I'm just
so sick of the two of them.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.820
I just need
some serious Holly time.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.447
Okay, cool.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.074
Hey, look, so here's
what I'm thinking.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.744
I'm not going to prom,
Shorty is not going to prom

04:04.827 --> 04:06.162
you're not going to prom.

04:06.245 --> 04:09.207
I wanted to do something
nice for everybody.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.959
Holly, throw us a party.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.627
Oh, you know what?
That's a great idea.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.463
That's the perfect way to get
my mind off of all this crap.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.007
You know, and everybody's
celebrating the end of the year.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.926
Why shouldn't we?
We worked hard.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.762
[laughing]

04:22.845 --> 04:24.514
You know, you should have,
like, an anti-prom.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.892
You know, no decorations,
no dresses, no dates, no crowns.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.186
Ooh, can we get some sluts?

04:30.269 --> 04:31.354
Sure. It'll be fun.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.772
I mean, this is
the kind of party

04:32.855 --> 04:34.732
you should have
at the end of high school.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.068
Can I come?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.277
Oh, hey, Joanne.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.696
Uh, you're not
going to the prom?

04:39.779 --> 04:42.907
Nope. Don't have a date.
Hate the prom.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.158
Then you're invited.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.453
I could bring,
like, a ton of bread.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.622
My dad drives
a bread truck.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.751
That'd be awesome, Joanne.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.674
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.509
Where's Kate?
I thought she was coming.

05:01.592 --> 05:03.219
We just had a huge fight.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.847
Yeah, she kept yelling at me
saying I wasn't committed

05:05.930 --> 05:07.724
enough in the relationship.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.184
And you know what? Fine.
If she wants to end it--

05:10.268 --> 05:11.477
She ended it?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.105
Yeah.
You know what?

05:14.188 --> 05:16.733
Uh, can we not talk
about this right now?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.609
- Sucks.
- Sorry, dude.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.028
Hey, if it makes you feel better

05:20.111 --> 05:21.612
I'm throwing a party
tomorrow night.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.322
It's kind of
an anti-prom thing.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.615
You wanna go?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.826
Well, it looks like
I'm not going to my prom

05:26.909 --> 05:29.412
so, yeah, that'd be great.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.039
Great.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.457
Thanks.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.958
You're more than welcome.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.585
Alright, I'm gonna get
something to drink.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.919
- You guys want anything?
- No, thanks.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.504
Nah, we're good.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.923
No girlfriend, huh?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.717
Looks like Holly time is over.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.095
Hey, I am just helping
Henry's healing process

05:46.179 --> 05:48.848
and I happen to know
he really likes bread.

I love it there.
Everything is giant.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.955
Are you still
looking at that invitation?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.373
Why don't you
just pick up the phone

06:14.457 --> 06:16.709
and call Rick,
and ask him when he sent it?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.544
[laughing]

06:18.628 --> 06:19.712
What?

06:19.796 --> 06:21.547
Because, Holly,
if I am not supposed

06:21.631 --> 06:24.467
to have contact with him,
and Julie picks up the phone

06:24.550 --> 06:28.137
then what will
I be having, contact.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.889
Whatever.
I'm going to Price Club.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.641
(both)
Price Club!

06:33.184 --> 06:35.603
I'm sorry. Okay.
Why are you going to Price Club?

06:35.686 --> 06:37.480
(both)
Price Club!

06:37.563 --> 06:38.940
Okay, that's gotta stop.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.358
I gotta pick up
a bunch of stuff

06:40.441 --> 06:42.360
for the anti-prom
I'm throwing tomorrow night.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.028
What? I'm sorry.
What? When?

06:44.112 --> 06:45.988
I'm throwing an anti-prom,
it's kind of a party

06:46.072 --> 06:47.824
for everyone
who's not going to the prom.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.451
Ooh, can I go? Please.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.955
Oh, I wanna go to a prom.
I wanna go to a prom.

06:54.038 --> 06:56.791
No, it's not a prom,
it's an anti-prom.

06:56.874 --> 07:00.211
Okay, I don't care
if it's a monkey prom.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.004
I need to go to a prom.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.800
[instrumental music]

07:09.262 --> 07:10.888
No! I can't do it.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.349
How else are you gonna find out
when they sent this invitation?

07:13.432 --> 07:15.434
Now, if Rick answers, just ask
if he meant to invite you

07:15.518 --> 07:17.353
to the wedding, and if
Julie answers, just hang up.

07:17.436 --> 07:18.688
And you're positive

07:18.771 --> 07:20.398
that caller ID
doesn't work on this phone.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.483
Please, I called and
hung up on an ex-boyfriend

07:22.567 --> 07:26.028
forty times from this phone.
Trust me, it's a good one.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.530
Hey, you guys gonna
be on there a long time?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.408
- My cell phone just died.
- Oh, here. Use mine.

to see if she got invited

07:33.953 --> 07:36.455
to his wedding, and she doesn't
want him to know who it is.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.875
- Did you get an invitation?
- Yeah.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.084
- Then you're invited.
- No.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.378
- I couldn't read the postmark.
- So?

07:42.461 --> 07:44.714
So, I don't know
if I'm invited or not.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.799
Did you get an invitation?

07:46.883 --> 07:48.885
Gary, it's Rick's wedding.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.721
Oh, yeah, yeah, the guy you like
who's getting married.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.098
Well, if you like him, why would
you wanna go to his wedding?

07:54.182 --> 07:55.892
Wouldn't that
be kind of painful?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.603
- I guess.
- Then why do you wanna go?

07:58.686 --> 07:59.687
I don't know if I do.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.105
Well, when are you gonna decide?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.024
When I find out
if I was invited or not.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.693
Did you get an invitation?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.321
[instrumental music]

08:15.286 --> 08:16.829
You sure are looking
at the front door a lot.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.372
You expecting
somebody special?

08:18.456 --> 08:21.834
No, for your information,
as my guests enter

08:21.918 --> 08:23.753
I like to establish eye contact

08:23.836 --> 08:25.588
and give each
of them a warm smile

08:25.671 --> 08:27.673
so they know
that they're welcome.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.427
Oh, God, it's that freak
from the chess club.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.136
Look away.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.225
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.601
Throw this away for me,
would you?

08:38.683 --> 08:40.352
Uh, that's
the wedding invitation.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.230
Yeah, I know.
Made a decision.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.857
Don't care when he sent it.
I'm not going.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.777
Don't know why I ever wanted
to go in the first place.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.654
Went a little crazy,
but now I'm back.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.243
- Good for you.
- Mm.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.369
Ahem.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.957
Hey, Joanne.
You having a good time?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.126
- This party's unbelievable.
- Thanks.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.795
You know, I was shattered

09:05.878 --> 09:07.213
about not going to the prom

09:07.296 --> 09:09.507
but this is, like,
ten times better.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.301
Can I tell you a secret?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.639
I met someone.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.808
I'm the happiest
I've ever been.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.436
That's awesome, Joanne.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.357
What's she talking about,
shattered?

09:26.440 --> 09:28.025
She could have
gone to the prom.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.319
I know two guys who asked her,
and she told them both no.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.572
Now that's weird.
I wonder why she..

09:35.491 --> 09:37.285
Oh.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.332
Joanne's awesome.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.335
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Vince.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.753
Holly, this is Gina.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.046
Um, where do you
want me to put these?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.214
Oh, there's an ice chest
on the terrace

09:50.298 --> 09:51.507
and would you
do me a favor

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
and change the music
and put on a good song?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.511
- Not a problem.
- Thanks.

09:55.594 --> 09:56.846
Did you know
he was coming?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.639
Yeah, Gary asked me
if he could invite him

09:58.723 --> 09:59.682
and I said yeah.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.891
Okay, what's going on?

10:00.975 --> 10:02.601
Oh, no more Vince.
She's back on Henry.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.437
Henry?
You're back on Henry?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.855
When did you, how could you..

10:05.938 --> 10:08.441
Oh, wait, I like Henry.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.192
No, I am not back on Henry

10:10.276 --> 10:12.862
and why are you creating
drama when there is none?

10:12.945 --> 10:14.697
Why didn't you just
go to the real prom?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.074
Okay, now, you look me
straight in the eye

10:17.158 --> 10:19.827
and tell me you're not glad
that Henry and Kate broke up.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.912
I am glad Henry..

10:21.996 --> 10:22.872
I am not glad--

10:22.955 --> 10:26.792
You said glad.
You said glad.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.712
- You did say glad.
- Alright. Okay.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.590
So what if I'm back on Henry,
is that so bizarre?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.216
He's a great guy,
and it's not like

10:34.300 --> 10:35.343
when we broke up,
I hated him.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.845
I was just confused about that.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.932
But I am over that.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.976
I'm not sure that my feelings
for Henry ever went away

10:44.060 --> 10:45.978
and I'm starting to think
that maybe breaking up with him

10:46.062 --> 10:49.398
was a mistake, and now that
he and Kate have broken up

10:49.482 --> 10:51.901
I'm going to tell him that
as soon as he gets here.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.995
You guys ever think that maybe
Joanne's got the right idea?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.127
[instrumental music]

11:13.673 --> 11:15.299
So, ahem..

11:15.383 --> 11:18.135
...that's great that you
and Kate got back together.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.428
I'm so happy for you.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.846
Yeah, I don't know
what happened.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.556
She just called me
this afternoon

11:22.640 --> 11:24.350
and said she made a big mistake

11:24.433 --> 11:27.103
and she asked me
if we could please try again.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.481
Well, great.
I'm so happy for you.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.191
Really happy.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.113
Hey, you okay?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.614
Miserable.
Have some bread.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.282
Oh, yeah, sweetie..

11:41.951 --> 11:43.577
Wait! What are you doing?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.788
I'm throwing
the garbage away.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.873
In there?
Are you crazy?

11:54.588 --> 11:57.133
[doorbell rings]

11:59.385 --> 12:00.970
Oh, dear God.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.349
Don't tell me. Is someone
else wearing my dress?

12:05.433 --> 12:08.269
- No, I think you're safe.
- Oh, thank God.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.563
'Cause that would have
been really embarrassing.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.482
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.526
I just saw Kate outside.
Did she come with Henry?

12:15.609 --> 12:18.362
Of course she came with Henry.
She's his girlfriend.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.989
Okay, it's just that
Gary said that they..

12:20.072 --> 12:22.283
Broke up? Yeah, I know.
Well, they got back together.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.285
Broken up one minute,
back together the next.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.995
I just hope
she appreciates what she has.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.997
That's all I hope.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.790
- I'm sure she does.
- Well, I'm not so sure.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.417
She said some pretty
hurtful things to him

12:31.500 --> 12:35.379
but if she makes Henry happy,
that's all I care about.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.090
Why are you so obsessed
with Henry anyway?

12:38.174 --> 12:39.175
- I'm obsessed?
- Yeah.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.718
I find it interesting

12:40.801 --> 12:43.137
that you're so curious
about Henry's personal life.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.266
(Vince)
'You know
what I find interesting?'

12:47.349 --> 12:50.978
It's the way you're looking
at Henry right now.

12:51.061 --> 12:53.105
Shouldn't you be with your date?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.984
- Hey, what was that about?
- I don't know.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.319
I just came over to say hi

12:58.402 --> 12:59.987
and she started
going off about Henry.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.071
Well, what'd you say?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.531
Nothing, I just said

13:02.615 --> 13:04.366
I thought she was a little
obsessed with the guy.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.494
Well, why would you say that?

13:06.577 --> 13:08.370
I just find it interesting.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.372
Oh, well, I find it
interesting how obsessed you are

13:10.456 --> 13:12.958
with Holly being obsessed
with Henry.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.251
I am not.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.711
Sure seems like it to me.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.214
You know what else
I find interesting?

13:18.297 --> 13:21.425
The way you're looking
at Holly right now.

13:21.509 --> 13:24.178
You know what I find
interesting about you right now?

13:24.261 --> 13:26.222
Nothing.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.640
Hey, what was that all about?

13:27.723 --> 13:29.558
That was about
everybody we know being crazy.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.768
What do you mean?

13:30.851 --> 13:32.394
I mean, I'm sick
and tired of everyone

13:32.478 --> 13:35.314
saying they're just friends when
they really like each other.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.066
Holly is just
friends with Henry

13:37.149 --> 13:38.901
and Vince is
just friends with Holly.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.111
I don't know why they just
can't be honest with each other.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.073
The most honest person in
this room right now is Joanne.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.079
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.248
Awesome prom, huh?

13:52.331 --> 13:55.626
Did you see how everyone's
looking at my dress?

13:55.709 --> 13:56.752
Oh, yeah.

13:56.835 --> 13:57.962
Think they're jealous?

13:58.045 --> 13:59.755
Oh, yeah.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.090
Hey, where are you going?

14:01.173 --> 14:02.591
I'm gonna go to my room
and call Rick.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.260
It's driving me crazy.
I have to know.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.096
Okay, wait. Come with me
to the ladies' room.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.931
There is no ladies' room.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.891
There is a restroom
for one person.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.810
We're in my house.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.480
No, it's my prom

14:16.564 --> 14:19.942
and girls at the prom
go to the restroom together.

14:20.025 --> 14:23.487
Why are you trying
to ruin prom for me?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.947
Okay, I'll call
from the bathroom.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.408
Oh, yay!
Okay, come on.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.292
Oh, oh, you ain't gonna
win queen looking like that.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.420
You know, I don't know
why I didn't do this sooner.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.088
I don't know
what I'm so afraid of.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.715
I mean, what's
the worst that could hap..

14:42.798 --> 14:46.427
Julie? Hi.
Uh, it's Val Tyler here.

14:46.510 --> 14:51.390
Hi, I was calling because, uh,
I got an invitation, and I wa..

14:51.473 --> 14:53.100
Oh.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.476
Yeah, that's what I thought.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.937
And I was just calling to..

14:57.021 --> 14:59.440
Hello?

14:59.523 --> 15:00.649
Yeah.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.484
It's all cleared up.
That was a mistake.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.862
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.323
It's okay.
It's exactly what I expected.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.325
Well, I don't know
if you realize this

15:09.408 --> 15:11.535
but the perfect place
to cry at the prom

15:11.619 --> 15:15.497
is right here,
in the ladies' room.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.916
That's good to know,
but, uh, I'm fine.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.126
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.586
'Cause you can
cry if you want to.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.046
No, I'm good.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.340
Seriously, look,
it is not a prom

15:24.423 --> 15:26.342
unless someone locks
themselves in the bathroom

15:26.425 --> 15:29.178
and has a meltdown,
or loses their virginity.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.973
Now which is it gonna be?

15:36.977 --> 15:39.521
[upbeat music]

15:48.489 --> 15:49.573
Holly.

15:49.657 --> 15:53.410
The sourdough twists
are going like hotcakes.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.038
Want me to call my dad?

15:56.121 --> 15:58.874
- No. Thanks, Joanne.
- What's the matter?

15:58.957 --> 16:03.045
- Did somebody steal your smile?
- I don't know, Joanne.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.547
I don't know what
the hell's going on with me.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.007
I broke up
with this great guy

16:07.091 --> 16:08.509
because I started
liking this other guy

16:08.592 --> 16:10.094
and this guy
is terrible at relationships

16:10.177 --> 16:12.596
and then I thought I could
get back with the first guy

16:12.680 --> 16:14.098
but he was dating someone else

16:14.181 --> 16:16.266
and now they broke up,
then they got back together.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.102
I'm just messed up.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.728
You know what?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.855
You're my best friend.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.696
[instrumental music]

16:35.160 --> 16:36.412
Look at this.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.580
I found this chicken bone
under the couch cushion.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.417
Your friends are destroying
the loft. I want them out.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.503
Okay, A, we're not
even serving chicken

16:44.586 --> 16:46.338
and B, they aren't my friends.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.757
I don't even know
half these people.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.592
I don't care.
I want them out, okay?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.053
It's late, it's loud.
I just, I want everybody gone.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.638
It's 8 o'clock.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.848
I don't care.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.266
I want them gone, okay?

16:57.349 --> 17:00.310
No. Not okay.
It's my anti-prom.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.855
- It's my loft.
- Your loft?

17:02.938 --> 17:04.440
Yes, I pay the rent.
It's my loft.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.733
Okay, fine, well, I'll move out,
and I'll get my own loft

17:06.817 --> 17:08.777
and then I'll have
all the anti-proms I want.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.279
Uh, you know
what your problem is?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.865
You are going
a little nuts.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.284
Oh, I'm going nuts?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.453
You're the one who's
running around like a maniac

17:17.536 --> 17:19.246
trying to find the postmark
on an invitation

17:19.329 --> 17:21.707
to a wedding
of a guy you secretly love.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.794
Now that is beyond wacko.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.089
You know, at least I don't
like a different guy every week.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.632
I mean, you are
all over the place.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.176
I mean,
one week you like Vince

17:32.259 --> 17:35.429
and then all of a sudden,
now you're back to liking Henry.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.348
Well, at least the guy I like
isn't marrying someone else!

17:38.432 --> 17:40.976
[gasping]

17:44.688 --> 17:48.400
- Wha.. Kate, um..
- So what about you?

17:48.484 --> 17:51.737
Can you honestly tell me you
don't have feelings for Holly?

18:04.541 --> 18:06.418
Oh, hey, have you seen Val?

18:06.502 --> 18:09.379
Yeah, she's probably
digging for chicken bones.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.340
You know,
I'm really worried about her.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.925
She called Julie,
and it turns out

18:13.008 --> 18:15.260
the invitation was a mistake.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.971
They don't want her
at the wedding.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.390
Oh, God.
I have to go find her.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.934
No, no.
It's your party. I'll go.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.852
No, we had a huge fight.
I have to tell her.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.396
Plus, you probably
don't want to go looking

18:26.480 --> 18:28.690
so pretty in your dress.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.651
Yeah, you're right.
You should go look for her.

18:30.734 --> 18:33.111
Um, I have
one more thing to do.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.614
Where did you get that?

18:35.697 --> 18:37.783
In the back
of Val's closet. Shh.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.036
Uh-oh.

18:41.119 --> 18:44.248
Looks like
I just found my king.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.917
[instrumental music]

18:51.755 --> 18:54.466
Here's your pie. I'll be
right back with the coffee.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.969
Don't worry about it. I'm
really only in it for the pie.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.223
Mmm.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.558
Hey.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.475
Hey.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.561
Lauren told me what happened.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.728
Mm.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.188
How'd you know
where to find me?

19:08.272 --> 19:11.650
Pie. I couldn't
get any at Price Club.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.861
Price Club!

19:13.944 --> 19:15.112
Thanks, but I'm fine.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.655
You can go back
to your anti-prom.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.448
No, I don't wanna go back.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.368
My anti-prom is more
prom than the real prom.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.870
Chicks crying
in the bathroom

19:22.953 --> 19:24.746
boyfriends and girlfriends
getting back together.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.915
It's just so high school.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.750
Well, I hate
to tell you this

19:28.834 --> 19:29.835
but it never ends.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.253
I'm almost 30 years old

19:31.336 --> 19:33.755
and that chick crying
in the bathroom was me.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.593
I'm sorry.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.219
No, I'm sorry.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.346
I shouldn't have yelled
at you like that, you know?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.849
- I was just, like..
- No, I know.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.727
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
yelled at you, I was just..

19:46.810 --> 19:48.228
I know.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.273
I'm sorry about Rick,
but, you know, maybe it's better

19:51.356 --> 19:52.941
that you don't go
to the wedding.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.903
I mean, don't you think it
might have kind of killed you?

19:55.986 --> 19:57.279
Can I tell you
something insane?

19:57.362 --> 19:58.780
Now, you're gonna
totally judge me

19:58.864 --> 20:00.282
but I'm going
to tell you anyway.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.451
You wanna know why I really
wanted to go to that wedding?

20:02.534 --> 20:03.827
Why?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.371
I pictured I would be
sitting in that church

20:06.455 --> 20:08.790
and Rick would walk in,
and we would look at each other

20:08.874 --> 20:11.376
and he would realize that
I was the right one for him

20:11.460 --> 20:13.879
and then he would
run over and grab my hand

20:13.962 --> 20:15.213
and we'd race out of there

20:15.297 --> 20:18.467
and jump in the limo
and drive off.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.885
But you know,
that would never happen.

20:19.968 --> 20:23.805
Oh, no, I know,
and I, I wouldn't want it to.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.099
But maybe it would.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.437
Can I tell you
something else?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.648
Anything.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.360
Last week,
when Rick was here, we kissed.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.861
You kissed?

20:37.945 --> 20:38.987
Okay, what do you mean kiss?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.490
You mean like mwah or like..

20:46.453 --> 20:49.831
Neither, really, but kinda
more like the second one.

20:49.915 --> 20:54.461
No wonder you're so upset.
So what happened after the kiss?

20:54.544 --> 21:00.050
What happened was he left,
and he's getting married.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.975
Rhonda,
we're gonna need more pie.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.143
Mm-hmm.
