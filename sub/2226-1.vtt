WEBVTT

00:56.616 --> 00:58.277
Can we go now?

00:58.318 --> 01:00.285
Our suspect is in the hotel, but don't worry,

01:00.319 --> 01:04.982
your client is in no danger. My best mars on the job.

01:09.227 --> 01:10.853
Gibert to Alain.

01:12.028 --> 01:16.157
Suspect located. Distance roughly... 15 meters.

01:16.198 --> 01:18.462
- Get over here. - I'm here, boss.

01:18.501 --> 01:20.162
Concentrate, Alain!

01:20.202 --> 01:22.567
See the wildcat at 11 o'clock?

01:23.304 --> 01:25.363
It's a maritime expression.

01:25.406 --> 01:28.568
In Marseille 10 years, and still not seen the sea?

01:28.609 --> 01:30.770
I have. When we patrol the port.

01:30.811 --> 01:32.573
Ok, I see.

01:32.612 --> 01:34.876
12 o'clock is straight ahead,

01:34.914 --> 01:38.371
so 11 o'clock's that way, a bit to the left.

01:39.518 --> 01:40.951
I get it.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.252
Are you sure that's a suspect?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.947
Looks like a chambermaid.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.547
A terrorist doesn't go round yelling

01:47.591 --> 01:49.751
with explosives strapped to his waist.

01:49.793 --> 01:50.157
That's right.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.751
They wear disguise.

01:51.895 --> 01:57.059
What better than a chambermaid

01:57.099 --> 01:58.566
- pushing her can't along? - Of course.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.964
Especially in a hotel.

02:00.001 --> 02:03.869
The song encourages him to commit his dastardly act.

02:03.905 --> 02:06.168
Sounds like Spanish.

02:06.206 --> 02:08.868
A revolutionary anthem!

02:14.213 --> 02:15.440
Watch out!

02:17.515 --> 02:20.143
On my signal, neutralize the Basque!

02:20.185 --> 02:21.549
10/5.

02:23.086 --> 02:24.553
12 o'clock!

02:26.190 --> 02:28.350
Good job! Betrayed by his own song!

02:28.391 --> 02:30.359
To the cars!

02:30.593 --> 02:32.253
I'll question him later.

02:35.297 --> 02:36.355
What's happening?

02:36.398 --> 02:39.457
Sir, I've just neutralized the Hispanic terrorist

02:39.500 --> 02:41.764
with a can't full of

02:41.802 --> 02:43.962
what look like toxic products.

02:44.003 --> 02:45.265
I'm sending them to the lab.

02:45.305 --> 02:46.567
Perfect, Gibert!

02:46.606 --> 02:49.540
Get the client out of his room or he'll be late.

02:49.608 --> 02:51.439
It's as good as done, sir.

02:53.111 --> 02:54.441
Emilien? Coast's clear

02:54.478 --> 02:56.241
to deliver the package.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.243
Emilien! Answer me!

02:58.282 --> 02:59.748
I'm almost outside his door, chief!

03:00.483 --> 03:02.144
Honestly, jumping me on the job!

03:02.185 --> 03:04.448
I can't help it.

03:04.486 --> 03:08.252
You turn me on when you're in action.

03:08.290 --> 03:10.154
Reminds me of Sean Connery.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.249
Don't take liberties,

03:11.292 --> 03:13.954
just because you're stronger than me.

03:13.995 --> 03:15.859
Next time, you can tie me down.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.456
Quiet! The whole hotel's bugged.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.329
Yes, Inspector!

03:20.400 --> 03:23.027
I'll handle the package. You find Gibert.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.133
I love you, Emilien.

03:29.174 --> 03:31.039
I love you, too, but not now!

03:31.076 --> 03:32.736
Tonight, at home!

03:47.680 --> 03:49.237
Mr. Cisse!

03:49.281 --> 03:51.841
You're due on the pitch in 20 minutes.

03:51.883 --> 03:57.252
The charity is 9 For Africa. We're building an orphanage. That's my goal.

03:57.488 --> 04:01.355
Sorry, but I'm with the police. I'm here to...

04:01.391 --> 04:03.723
- What's your name? - Emilien.

04:06.195 --> 04:08.026
No, it's not for a... It's for the...

04:08.096 --> 04:11.223
This is no time to exchange cards.

04:11.265 --> 04:13.631
OK, where's this Gerbil-jibly...

04:13.668 --> 04:16.135
That'll twist foreign tongues.

04:16.169 --> 04:17.636
The name's Djibril Cisse.

04:17.671 --> 04:19.036
Don't get smart with me,

04:19.072 --> 04:22.234
or you'll be straight in the pen.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.439
Emilien, look. Nothing like him.

04:25.477 --> 04:26.636
The nose, teeth...

04:26.678 --> 04:29.340
It's him, sir. I promise you.

04:29.380 --> 04:31.041
Not too fast! I smell a rat and I should know.

04:31.082 --> 04:35.245
2 years at customs. No illegals get past me.

04:35.285 --> 04:38.219
I bust the Korean people smugglers in '92.

04:38.287 --> 04:40.312
- He's not Korean. - Can you be sure?

04:40.389 --> 04:42.118
I checked his ID.

04:42.190 --> 04:44.715
- Look, slant eyes. - He's just tired.

04:44.759 --> 04:47.319
Let's go.

04:47.362 --> 04:48.419
The Prefect will lose patience.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.225
To the cars!

04:55.068 --> 04:58.525
I don't know why, but you're not popular here.

05:09.074 --> 05:12.440
Don't worry, he prefers fishing to football.

05:12.477 --> 05:13.739
Mumbling again, Emilien?

05:13.778 --> 05:15.904
I was just saying you're a keen angler.

05:15.979 --> 05:17.708
That's a real sport.

05:17.781 --> 05:18.907
Do you fly fish?

05:18.982 --> 05:21.313
I never do anything on the fly.

05:21.350 --> 05:24.615
Quite right!

05:24.654 --> 05:28.714
There's no room for amateurism in fishing.

05:28.757 --> 05:31.919
Take float fishing, for example, for stillwater tench.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.722
You can lie in wait for hours like a vulture,

05:33.761 --> 05:35.922
watching the float, then...

05:41.668 --> 05:42.827
What is it now?

05:42.868 --> 05:45.928
- Nothing broken? - No, I'm fine.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.200
Can't you ring your bell?

05:48.272 --> 05:51.708
They said Mr. Cisse was asleep. We didn't want to wake him.

05:51.776 --> 05:55.211
He's in my car. We're transferring him.

05:55.245 --> 05:56.712
Djibril Cisse?

05:56.746 --> 05:58.713
Transferred to Marseille?

05:58.747 --> 06:01.614
Shit, it's Cisse!

06:02.251 --> 06:04.013
Do something or we'll miss the match.

06:04.052 --> 06:05.314
Don't worry,

06:05.353 --> 06:07.321
I know a guy who can help.

06:11.658 --> 06:12.920
The police have taxis?

06:12.960 --> 06:15.223
He's with the air force.

06:17.663 --> 06:19.028
Marseille Express, at your service.

06:19.065 --> 06:22.591
Mr. Cisse has 8 minutes to get to the game.

06:22.667 --> 06:23.998
Good to have you aboard.

06:24.069 --> 06:26.195
You're playing for Marseille?

06:26.270 --> 06:28.500
A charity game. We'll miss kick-off.

06:28.539 --> 06:30.803
If it's for a good cause...

06:52.058 --> 06:54.423
I'll get changed to save time.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.189
You can try.

06:58.463 --> 07:01.398
Guess who's transferred to Marseille.

07:03.934 --> 07:06.596
This is the wrong way. The city's gridlocked.

07:06.637 --> 07:08.195
No kidding! Djibril Cisse himself!

07:18.847 --> 07:21.212
Number 9 for Olympique de Marseille.

07:21.248 --> 07:24.012
That's what I call a road.

07:26.352 --> 07:27.979
Like velvet.

07:28.054 --> 07:30.284
Can't even hear the engine.

07:30.356 --> 07:32.585
At this speed, only wind.

07:32.758 --> 07:36.488
News has just come in

07:36.527 --> 07:37.892
that Marseille has broken the bank to buy a wonder player,

07:37.929 --> 07:40.693
none other than Djibril Cisse.

07:44.334 --> 07:46.202
There's a taxi coming your way.

07:46.237 --> 07:47.998
ETA less than one minute.

07:48.037 --> 07:49.698
Got ya!

07:50.239 --> 07:51.706
It must be Daniel.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.003
It ain't gonna be the pope.

07:54.042 --> 07:55.202
The Parisian?

07:55.243 --> 07:56.301
Jeez, that's mean.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.311
He has to learn sometime.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.178
- Hey, Blondie! - Yes, sir?

08:01.248 --> 08:04.774
Can you check the radar over there?

08:04.850 --> 08:06.283
Switch it to ultra-sensitive, will you?

08:06.352 --> 08:07.785
Sir, yes, sir!

08:08.521 --> 08:13.389
Watch out, bullet train approaching. Stand back!

08:19.330 --> 08:23.493
Thanks, kid. We got a much better reading.

08:27.436 --> 08:30.303
- It really goes. - I customized it.

08:30.339 --> 08:32.602
Picked up parts from Concorde.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.403
Brake! We're nearly there.

08:34.442 --> 08:39.879
We just received confirmation. 60 million!

08:48.720 --> 08:49.880
The transfer of the year! There's traffic everywhere.

08:49.921 --> 08:51.684
I know a shortcut.

08:51.723 --> 08:54.190
I hate it when you say that.

08:56.026 --> 09:00.587
The wildest rumors surround

09:00.630 --> 09:03.393
the transfer of Djibril Cisse to Olympique de Marseille.

09:03.431 --> 09:07.868
To find out more, over to Armand Pecci at the Velodrome.

09:07.936 --> 09:10.563
Absolutely, we're here live in Marseille

09:10.638 --> 09:14.368
for the fund-raiser for a sick childrers charity.

09:14.440 --> 09:18.467
The player has asked for an astronomical sum.

09:18.511 --> 09:22.276
Figures of up to 200 million euros have been mentioned.

09:22.314 --> 09:25.180
He'll reveal all to us later live on TF1,

09:25.216 --> 09:27.184
but for now he's not even arrived.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.584
Djibril Cisse or not, we kick off in 2 minutes.

09:35.924 --> 09:36.686
Take a right.

09:36.725 --> 09:39.285
That's two "rights" already?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.192
You sure you been here before?

09:40.229 --> 09:42.958
Papal security.

09:43.031 --> 09:44.965
We spent 6 days here looking for Gibert.

09:45.033 --> 09:48.968
That's reassuring. How about we trust my instinct?

09:51.004 --> 09:52.470
OK, let's go!

10:01.212 --> 10:03.179
- 7' 32". - Thanks.

10:03.213 --> 10:04.976
Thank you.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.658
This is better than on TV.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.258
You're kind of in the way. Back to the stands,

10:28.301 --> 10:31.167
or it's a yellow card.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.966
Yes, ref.

11:11.002 --> 11:13.266
- What are you doing? - That's a free kick.

11:22.312 --> 11:24.438
- That wasrt a fair play! - Leave him alone!

12:13.987 --> 12:17.855
Let's warm up good! Lift your knees. I want no strains.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.834
- Like the shirt? - It's too big.

12:32.902 --> 12:34.836
You know your Mom.

12:34.871 --> 12:37.338
After the first wash,

12:37.373 --> 12:38.635
The autograph'll wash off.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.437
I'll ask her to wash round it.

12:41.476 --> 12:42.340
Listen to me.

12:42.377 --> 12:46.142
Stay on the pitch more than 3 minutes. No red cards.

12:46.179 --> 12:47.646
Are you ok?

12:48.782 --> 12:51.944
The golden rule is you don't go near the ball.

12:51.984 --> 12:52.643
Yes.

12:52.685 --> 12:55.153
If it comes to you, just kick it.

12:55.187 --> 12:55.949
Which way?

12:55.988 --> 12:58.353
Just kick. They can chase it.

12:58.390 --> 13:00.551
Can't I play a bit, though?

13:00.592 --> 13:03.116
When the match is over, with me.

13:04.695 --> 13:06.822
Go on, son!

13:07.197 --> 13:09.027
Don't run too fast.

13:18.373 --> 13:20.033
Sure he won't catch cold?

13:20.074 --> 13:23.339
I gave him a thermal undershirt and vitamin C earlier.

13:23.377 --> 13:25.640
Like that, not much can go wrong.

13:25.678 --> 13:28.146
Get him playing ice hockey.

13:28.181 --> 13:29.841
Too dangerous!

13:29.882 --> 13:31.747
His Mom wanted him to do karate.

13:31.784 --> 13:35.310
I had a word with the club. They turned him down.

13:35.386 --> 13:38.412
He's gonna have to learn to take a hit some time.

13:38.489 --> 13:40.513
Yeah, it'll be too soon.

13:40.590 --> 13:41.522
Try swimming.

13:41.558 --> 13:44.823
He has a bad chest. It's hereditary.

13:44.861 --> 13:47.124
You never broke anything as a kid?

13:47.163 --> 13:49.324
- My arm. 3 times. - You see?

13:49.365 --> 13:52.925
It didn't make me any smarter or get me into cop school.

13:54.069 --> 13:56.435
You shoulda tried breaking a leg.

13:58.572 --> 14:01.541
Well played, son, that's right!

14:03.876 --> 14:06.436
What'll happen to our kids?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.536
Whaddya mean?

14:07.579 --> 14:09.911
Mine a cabbie and yours a cop?

14:09.981 --> 14:12.609
Why not? They'd be doing well.

14:12.684 --> 14:14.514
We help people. Pretty neat, huh?

14:14.585 --> 14:16.610
Don't complain, there's worse.

14:16.654 --> 14:18.712
Mine a cabbie and yours a cop!

14:18.755 --> 14:20.518
Don't even mention it.

14:26.361 --> 14:27.828
This is Emilien.

14:29.163 --> 14:31.529
- Emilien? - An emergency?

14:31.566 --> 14:34.330
Gibert said that? I'm off duty today.

14:34.368 --> 14:35.334
Emilien...

14:35.368 --> 14:36.528
You okay, Maxime?

14:36.970 --> 14:39.336
- You're kidding me! - I think you oughta...

14:39.972 --> 14:41.529
OK, I'll be right there.

14:41.573 --> 14:44.098
Gibert's called everybody in.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.108
Petra's on an ultra-secret mission.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.303
And my Mom's gone to Lourdes.

14:48.378 --> 14:49.003
Lourdes?

14:49.046 --> 14:50.411
She goes since I was born.

14:50.447 --> 14:52.107
That was some miracle!

14:52.148 --> 14:54.912
- You'll take care of the kids? - No problem.

14:54.951 --> 14:57.009
Don't fill his face with cakes.

14:57.052 --> 15:00.613
Would I? Crust of bed, glass of water and to bed!

15:00.655 --> 15:03.316
Joke! I'll look after him like my own.

15:03.357 --> 15:04.517
That scares me.

15:04.558 --> 15:06.822
I look after your son every Wednesday.

15:06.861 --> 15:10.318
Has he ever come home with pimples?

15:10.363 --> 15:12.024
So, get moving.

15:12.065 --> 15:13.531
Thank you.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.394
4' 30". You beat your record.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.297
I didn't touch him!

15:26.368 --> 15:29.996
Stinky ref! Hands out cards like confetti.

15:30.839 --> 15:33.000
Get Max. We'll go eat waffles.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.099
C'mon, Max, let's go eat.

15:40.646 --> 15:43.114
Arrest that ball immediately!

15:43.649 --> 15:44.911
I got it, chief!

15:44.950 --> 15:46.917
Bring it over here.

15:52.055 --> 15:53.613
Wort bother me again.

15:54.657 --> 15:56.521
Here, kids, enjoy your game.

15:59.061 --> 16:04.597
This is no time for dribbles,stepovers and other football clownery.

16:04.632 --> 16:06.190
I had Paris on the phone.

16:06.234 --> 16:09.202
They're sending a very special delivery.

16:09.236 --> 16:12.000
The most important transfer of the year.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.095
- Drogba? - Thuram?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.400
I know! Makelele!

16:14.440 --> 16:15.805
- Beckenbauer? - Maradona?

16:15.841 --> 16:19.003
What a bunch of idiots!

16:19.043 --> 16:21.011
I'm not talking tennis, I'm talking crime.

16:21.045 --> 16:22.012
Bernard Tapie!

16:22.046 --> 16:24.605
Much more famous than him.

16:24.648 --> 16:27.310
On my files, he's public enemy No. 1

16:27.351 --> 16:33.983
It's none other than jeeycee Kassa-see...

16:34.056 --> 16:34.680
- jeeycee Kassa-see... - No, chief.

16:34.756 --> 16:36.485
Attention!

16:36.558 --> 16:38.287
That was yesterday's transfer.

16:38.326 --> 16:39.986
Where's today's?

16:40.027 --> 16:41.995
Turn the page. Save paper, remember?

16:42.029 --> 16:43.189
Yes, indeed.

16:43.230 --> 16:44.288
It's my wife.

16:44.331 --> 16:46.992
She saw a program on the Amazon forest.

16:47.033 --> 16:50.593
Know how many hectares are cut down every year?

16:53.639 --> 16:55.402
How many?

16:55.841 --> 16:58.809
It sends shivers down your spine.

16:58.843 --> 16:59.810
How many?

16:59.844 --> 17:05.281
Like billions of matchboxes, chopped down and up in flames.

17:05.348 --> 17:08.282
So, at the first chance, I say, show me your papers!

17:08.350 --> 17:10.784
I mean, save paper!

17:10.853 --> 17:12.786
What about public enemy No. 1?

17:12.820 --> 17:15.084
A Belgian whose name is enough to make you feel sick.

17:15.123 --> 17:19.991
53 armed robberies, 122 accomplice-to-murder raps.

17:20.027 --> 17:23.484
Biggest mobster since Al Capone.

17:23.529 --> 17:28.091
He's being transferred to Congo to stand trial for dozens of crimes.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.691
Stopover in Marseille.

17:29.734 --> 17:32.396
We take delivery, keep him warm

17:32.437 --> 17:34.199
till 5 a. m. Tomorrow

17:34.238 --> 17:37.002
and put him in the Congolese jet.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.770
He's not gonna see any sights.

17:40.543 --> 17:43.569
I want ultra-tight surveillance.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.375
An officer every square centimeter.

17:46.415 --> 17:49.384
So many cops, so close, he can't even see the sea.

17:49.418 --> 17:51.977
- Do I make myself hear? - Yes, chief!

17:52.019 --> 17:54.579
What time's he get in?

17:55.022 --> 17:57.489
Good question. 15:00 hours.

17:57.524 --> 17:59.389
It's already 5 past.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.393
5 past 12?

18:02.528 --> 18:04.996
To the cars!

18:05.030 --> 18:07.589
What's up? Isn't that what you ordered?

18:07.632 --> 18:08.690
Eat then.

18:08.733 --> 18:12.463
Dad said not to eat cream 'cos I get it all over.

18:12.536 --> 18:13.764
Well, he's wrong.

18:13.837 --> 18:16.670
Show him what a good eater you are.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.870
Shit! Your Dad! The cops!

18:33.911 --> 18:37.472
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

18:37.515 --> 18:40.574
The lady's got a flat.

18:42.617 --> 18:45.483
I gotta help in this heat.

18:45.519 --> 18:47.487
He's right. She'll dehydrate. She needs help.

18:47.521 --> 18:49.489
- I can do first aid! - I used to be a florist.

18:49.523 --> 18:51.990
Stop! Stay where you are!

18:58.530 --> 19:00.760
Some parents deserve to be sent tojail.

19:00.832 --> 19:03.857
How long does it take to change a tire?

19:05.301 --> 19:07.860
Here, we take the time to do things right.

19:11.504 --> 19:12.162
Thank you.

19:12.204 --> 19:15.071
About time, too. Drive!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.678
Tasty, at least?

22:20.763 --> 22:21.821
General!

22:21.864 --> 22:23.125
Gibert! That explains it.

22:23.164 --> 22:26.622
We took a shortcut, but the lady had a flat.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.133
1 hour to change a tire?

22:28.168 --> 22:30.432
In the police, a week at best.

22:30.470 --> 22:33.632
The first thing they learn now is to shoot.

22:33.672 --> 22:37.438
But cops deal with more flat tires than shootouts.

22:37.476 --> 22:39.534
Is it the same in the army?

22:39.577 --> 22:42.045
- We have caterpillars. - They're very good.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.740
Specially off road.

23:26.969 --> 23:30.131
That reminds me of a vacation in Africa.

23:30.172 --> 23:34.335
We slept in cages to keep the wild beasts away.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.309
This is the worst kind of beast.

23:36.377 --> 23:40.312
If he escapes, there'll be blood on the streets.

23:40.380 --> 23:41.813
Don't worry, General, we're used to his sort.

23:41.848 --> 23:44.008
2 hours to tame him.

23:44.049 --> 23:47.815
Tomorrow, he'll be juggling balls on his nose.

23:47.853 --> 23:49.410
Load him up!

24:01.757 --> 24:02.815
Good job!

24:02.858 --> 24:05.917
Your career hangs on this.

24:05.960 --> 24:10.021
It's in the bag. Let's synchronize watches.

24:10.064 --> 24:11.621
- 16:20. - 5 past 12. Perfect.

24:11.664 --> 24:14.633
Touch base every 2 hours. Go!

24:24.070 --> 24:25.503
Hello.

24:25.571 --> 24:27.197
General! Already?

24:27.239 --> 24:31.300
It's taken you a mere 30 seconds to mess up.

24:31.343 --> 24:33.708
- Sorry? - Check your mirror.

24:34.645 --> 24:39.308
The label! I can see much better now. Thank you, General.

24:39.649 --> 24:42.914
I meant your side-view mirror.

24:42.952 --> 24:45.317
Look to your right.

24:46.655 --> 24:50.215
Shit! Reverse engines!

24:59.665 --> 25:03.101
He has the point.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.595
You're sure about the address?

25:05.637 --> 25:07.195
100%.

25:07.238 --> 25:11.799
You stay in the car. I'll be much happier on my own.

25:11.842 --> 25:14.003
Lf, and I emphasize the "if",

25:14.044 --> 25:16.102
I'm gone 30 minutes, come get me.

25:16.145 --> 25:17.908
Yeah, right!

25:18.748 --> 25:20.113
What?

25:20.650 --> 25:24.608
Call me before you unleash him. To be on the safe side.

25:24.653 --> 25:25.915
No worries.

25:34.027 --> 25:36.587
Gee, he missed it!

26:14.527 --> 26:16.187
Let me see how well you can handle this.

26:20.031 --> 26:21.292
HI, Daniel!

26:21.332 --> 26:23.800
This was on the road.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.394
Is it yours? I knew it had hit the asphalt.

26:26.437 --> 26:27.494
Thanks.

26:27.537 --> 26:29.903
- Hiya, kids! - Jeez, they grow up quick.

26:29.939 --> 26:32.202
It's little Maxime!

26:32.240 --> 26:34.470
Lucky, he's not like his Dad.

26:35.043 --> 26:35.668
OK, let's go.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.870
Emiliers out on a mission.

26:37.945 --> 26:40.175
They can play on the computer.

26:44.015 --> 26:46.074
Where are your Dad's video games?

26:47.419 --> 26:49.386
Those'll keep you busy.

26:49.420 --> 26:51.888
I have to make a call. Be good.

26:56.326 --> 26:57.293
Can we both play?

26:57.327 --> 27:00.591
No, they gave Dad the worst computer.

27:00.629 --> 27:02.392
Hardly even sends email.

27:02.431 --> 27:05.092
- And Gibert's? - It's hot stuff!

27:05.132 --> 27:08.693
What the hell is all this garbage?

27:08.736 --> 27:11.260
Need an MA for the new models!

27:13.139 --> 27:15.369
- What? - We wanted to play.

27:15.442 --> 27:17.272
It's taken. Try another office.

27:17.309 --> 27:18.367
That one's

27:18.410 --> 27:21.776
a CORE2 total latest generation.

27:25.617 --> 27:28.676
- You know how to work this? - Child's play!

27:30.720 --> 27:32.482
- Hi, Marley. - How are you!

27:32.521 --> 27:34.580
Got anything for a sore throat?

27:34.623 --> 27:37.091
The seasors over. I ain't got much.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.989
Take a look.

27:42.129 --> 27:43.959
Yeah, right.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.664
- You join me? - Why not!

27:58.007 --> 28:00.167
- It'll wake me up. Here. - No, thanks.

28:00.208 --> 28:03.575
Not on duty. I'll smoke it tonight.

28:03.612 --> 28:07.672
Here, it's the opposite. We never smoke at home.

28:08.716 --> 28:11.684
- It's Gibert! - Check out the car!

28:21.025 --> 28:22.549
Alain?

28:22.627 --> 28:24.561
Put the beast in the main office.

28:24.629 --> 28:26.653
- Out of the cage? - Of course not!

28:26.696 --> 28:29.256
May I remind you, he's extremely dangerous?

28:29.299 --> 28:31.960
I know, but the cage is extremely big.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.969
Stop discussing the discussion.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.664
Action!

28:39.407 --> 28:40.374
All units...

28:40.408 --> 28:42.967
Big bad wolf's back. Over.

28:43.010 --> 28:44.671
That's Gibert! Lose it.

29:01.892 --> 29:03.860
Marley!

29:03.894 --> 29:06.054
- Come here. - Yes, sir?

29:07.196 --> 29:09.562
- Have you been smoking? - No, I swear...

29:09.598 --> 29:10.257
Don't lie to me.

29:10.299 --> 29:13.666
I have a very sensitive nose.

29:13.702 --> 29:16.864
I trained with mountain rescue dogs.

29:16.904 --> 29:18.667
I can sniff snow like no man.

29:18.706 --> 29:19.570
It's great.

29:19.607 --> 29:22.575
I could detect grass over a mile away. Wicked!

29:22.609 --> 29:24.076
I guess so.

29:24.110 --> 29:28.637
I'll let it ride. Last chance, OK?

29:32.684 --> 29:34.447
Type your password.

29:37.587 --> 29:39.452
Select a photo.

29:41.491 --> 29:44.857
Click on the one you don't want.

29:45.995 --> 29:48.462
Then click on the one you want.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.966
Thanks, boys. I don't know

29:53.001 --> 29:55.059
what I'd have done without you.

29:55.102 --> 29:57.366
You deserve a reward.

29:58.604 --> 30:00.629
A bill for each of you.

30:03.109 --> 30:06.339
Put it away. Our secret.

30:06.978 --> 30:08.536
What are you doing, boys?

30:08.580 --> 30:12.345
I don't want you on my computer.

30:14.585 --> 30:16.347
And what are you doing?

30:17.887 --> 30:19.946
You're the new IT trainer?

30:22.491 --> 30:24.550
- Right. - Sorry, I'd forgotten.

30:24.593 --> 30:27.857
It's not a luxury having a teacher for this.

30:27.895 --> 30:32.922
I'm pretty electronically minded, but I've met my match here.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.626
Short and sweet.

30:34.701 --> 30:37.931
I've had a long day. Feels like my head'll explode.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.937
Sorry, but you're smoking.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.837
I stopped 3 weeks ago.

30:41.874 --> 30:45.240
I have pretty good willpower, but this time I resorted to a patch.

30:45.276 --> 30:46.538
- Yes, indeed! - Graet.

30:48.479 --> 30:51.243
I meant, your head's smoking.

30:51.582 --> 30:54.846
- So it is. - May I?

30:55.585 --> 30:57.644
Where'd that come from?

30:57.687 --> 31:00.246
Morocco, definitely.

31:00.288 --> 31:02.848
Put it out. It's a no-smoking office.

31:02.891 --> 31:04.050
Sorry.

31:04.992 --> 31:07.825
Can we start? I have a busy schedule.

31:07.895 --> 31:10.522
Where did you get to in your last lesson?

31:10.597 --> 31:12.224
Adjusting the chair.

31:13.366 --> 31:15.026
Take the mouse.

31:15.067 --> 31:17.831
One eye on the screen, one on the keyboard.

31:17.870 --> 31:21.532
One eye on the screen, one on the keyboard...

31:31.480 --> 31:33.141
This won't be easy.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.946
That's for 6-year-olds?

31:36.985 --> 31:39.112
Dad! It's totally harmless.

31:39.187 --> 31:41.121
We haven't played it for ages.

31:42.589 --> 31:46.025
It's awful. You have no idea.

31:46.059 --> 31:48.526
No, I never have any ideas.

31:48.561 --> 31:51.530
We got a huge job. A major client!

31:51.564 --> 31:53.622
- What kind? - Wanted all over Europe.

31:53.665 --> 31:56.930
They sent him here? He'll learn to play boules.

31:56.968 --> 31:59.128
No time. He's flying out to Congo at 5 tomorrow.

31:59.170 --> 32:00.228
If he's not escaped.

32:00.271 --> 32:03.933
This isn't a police station, it's a summer camp.

32:03.973 --> 32:06.237
- Relax. - If that's not what it was, then it's great.

32:07.877 --> 32:11.243
Gibert wants us all in to work overtime.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.404
I can't get hold of Petra.

32:14.482 --> 32:16.814
Always some damn top secret mission.

32:16.884 --> 32:18.818
So, I'm stuck with the kid...

32:18.853 --> 32:22.219
And could your friend Daniel look after him?

32:22.255 --> 32:25.224
Just a couple of hours

32:25.257 --> 32:26.815
until I get off duty.

32:26.859 --> 32:29.020
- 2 sugars in your coffee? - Thank you.

32:29.361 --> 32:32.329
When do I do any work? I've had the kids all day.

32:32.363 --> 32:33.830
Can't Lily help out?

32:33.865 --> 32:35.526
She's in Paris on a decorating course.

32:35.567 --> 32:37.124
Decorating?

32:37.167 --> 32:40.625
She's decided to redecorate the garage.

32:41.671 --> 32:43.832
- Yikes! - You said it.

32:43.873 --> 32:46.103
She wants the taxi to sleep outside.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.903
Ouch!

32:48.076 --> 32:49.600
You're a dead man!

32:49.678 --> 32:54.808
It could be a good thing. Lily puts flowers everywhere.

32:54.849 --> 32:57.317
Pollen blocks up the carburetors.

32:57.351 --> 32:59.910
I spend all weekend cleaning them with cotton buds.

32:59.953 --> 33:03.013
You have to learn to compromise.

33:03.056 --> 33:04.613
You compromise with Petra?

33:04.656 --> 33:07.124
No kidding.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.626
- For example? - My clothes.

33:09.660 --> 33:11.924
When I was single, I never tidied up.

33:11.963 --> 33:15.227
Anything lying around, Petra threw it out the window.

33:15.265 --> 33:17.825
- Your shorts, too? - Everything!

33:18.869 --> 33:20.802
So, you learned to be tidier?

33:20.870 --> 33:25.602
I bought a fishing rod. Saved me 3 flights of stairs.

33:28.243 --> 33:30.211
When can you pick Max up?

33:30.245 --> 33:31.905
In 2 hours.

33:31.945 --> 33:33.810
OK, you have 2 hours.

33:33.847 --> 33:36.815
- You're a pal. - Yeah, I know.

33:39.952 --> 33:42.920
As it's just us guys tonight,

33:42.954 --> 33:46.321
how about a TV dinner in the garage?

33:46.358 --> 33:47.824
Deal!

33:50.160 --> 33:52.787
You can keep them busy for 2 hours?

33:52.862 --> 33:54.295
I have an idea.

33:58.463 --> 34:01.296
- Granddad! - My little soldiers!

34:01.366 --> 34:03.390
Great to see you!

34:03.434 --> 34:04.901
Wasrt it Sunday?

34:04.936 --> 34:07.905
We were going to see a movie

34:07.939 --> 34:09.405
and they insisted we stop by.

34:09.439 --> 34:11.600
Granddad, I missed you!

34:11.641 --> 34:13.108
I wanna stay with Leo.

34:13.143 --> 34:15.303
My little lambs. I'm here now.

34:15.344 --> 34:19.110
Granddad's here, don't worry.

34:19.148 --> 34:20.307
They're so sensitive.

34:20.348 --> 34:23.408
Yeah, their mothers are away.

34:23.451 --> 34:25.611
They act hard but they're softies.

34:27.154 --> 34:31.487
Couldrt you let them stay a few hours?

34:32.758 --> 34:35.192
2 hours, no more! They have homework.

34:35.261 --> 34:37.592
2 hours. Not a second more!

34:52.333 --> 34:54.198
He's been gone an hour. Let's go!

34:54.235 --> 34:56.294
Give him 5 more minutes, OK?

34:56.337 --> 35:00.500
Turn it, that's right. Now, lower it. Faster...

35:00.540 --> 35:01.802
Faster?

35:01.842 --> 35:05.004
Turn it... That's right. Not bad.

35:05.044 --> 35:07.012
You gotta get the rhythm.

35:07.046 --> 35:07.808
We're done, chief.

35:07.847 --> 35:10.280
Very clever!

35:10.348 --> 35:12.179
- You lost me the game. - Yes.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.479
Not bad for a first try.

35:14.551 --> 35:16.280
What's my score?

35:20.823 --> 35:22.791
- Excuse me. - Go ahead.

35:23.026 --> 35:24.890
It's Sukk. We coming in?

35:24.926 --> 35:28.692
No, there's no need. I'm done. I'll be right there.

35:28.730 --> 35:29.992
OK, cool.

35:30.032 --> 35:31.896
- What did he say? - Shut up.

35:31.932 --> 35:34.093
Sorry, I have to go.

35:34.135 --> 35:34.999
You do?

35:35.036 --> 35:36.798
I have a client waiting.

35:36.836 --> 35:39.498
See you next month, same time?

35:39.539 --> 35:40.903
With pleasure.

35:58.414 --> 36:01.474
What have you done? Are you nuts?

36:01.518 --> 36:03.075
You said the main office.

36:03.118 --> 36:05.382
I didn't argue. An order's an order.

36:05.420 --> 36:07.786
Very true. You've done well, Alain.

36:14.127 --> 36:16.891
Lose the cover. We're not here to mollycoddle him.

36:25.136 --> 36:27.161
It's pretty scary.

36:28.039 --> 36:30.268
- Is he really so nasty? - Even worse.

36:30.307 --> 36:32.559
He'd kill a sheep with his ears.

36:32.609 --> 36:34.577
Don't be afraid, young Emilien.

36:34.611 --> 36:37.670
I did 5 years in the jungle,

36:37.714 --> 36:39.477
living on spiders and hippos for UNESCO.

36:39.515 --> 36:41.675
A Belgian doesn't scare me.

36:43.719 --> 36:46.983
We'll start with some routine questions.

36:47.021 --> 36:49.080
Pass me the documents.

36:49.123 --> 36:50.784
Come on!

36:54.527 --> 36:56.461
Full name?

36:57.730 --> 36:59.857
Well? How did it go?

36:59.932 --> 37:01.763
It's a madhouse in there.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.158
It's freaky.

37:04.202 --> 37:05.669
C'mon, drive!

37:12.308 --> 37:14.070
So, he wants to play tough.

37:14.109 --> 37:15.076
The Bouches-du-Rhone.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.169
- Bouches-du-Rhone? - The special treatment.

37:19.013 --> 37:20.571
Answer the captain!

37:21.415 --> 37:23.076
Calm, everybody.

37:26.119 --> 37:31.249
Think you're smarter than me? Very well.

37:31.323 --> 37:34.258
In my drawer, my bush rifle.

37:35.726 --> 37:37.956
I brought this back from Guyana.

37:37.995 --> 37:39.553
A gift from the chief.

37:39.597 --> 37:42.656
One dart will put an elephant to sleep in 5 seconds.

37:42.699 --> 37:44.667
Watch out, it's loaded.

37:44.701 --> 37:47.760
Keep him in your sights. If he moves again, fire!

37:47.803 --> 37:48.861
No warning shot?

37:48.904 --> 37:53.670
There's only one dart. How can you fire a warning shot?

37:53.708 --> 37:55.073
My mistake!

37:56.311 --> 37:59.074
Back to the name. Full name?

37:59.813 --> 38:01.280
What's that?

38:01.315 --> 38:05.944
He's getting on my nerves! That's not a pretty sight, believe me.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.451
It's hard to talk with a ball-gag in.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.751
Excuses! If he wanted to, he could.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.252
Look, chief. He's trying to say something.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.055
Just what we're waiting for.

38:17.695 --> 38:19.753
Say we take out the gag, just to see?

38:19.796 --> 38:22.856
No! Give him a mile, he'll take an inch.

38:22.899 --> 38:24.763
That's what the slate's for, then.

38:24.800 --> 38:27.064
- The slate? - Look!

38:27.102 --> 38:29.263
With a bit of chalk. It's for him to communicate.

38:29.304 --> 38:31.271
He can write his answers.

38:31.305 --> 38:33.773
Go ahead. Write! Full name!

38:33.808 --> 38:36.332
He can't talk, but I think he hears us.

38:38.712 --> 38:40.236
Give him the chalk.

38:40.312 --> 38:42.439
Watch he doesn't eat your leg.

38:44.283 --> 38:46.045
Gently does it.

38:53.090 --> 38:54.751
Very good.

39:01.397 --> 39:02.954
Get out of the way quickly!

39:11.905 --> 39:13.531
What did he write?

39:17.277 --> 39:19.039
- Pipi. - Pipi?

39:19.077 --> 39:21.045
That his first or last name?

39:21.079 --> 39:23.047
He needs the toilet.

39:25.082 --> 39:29.541
Definitely not.

39:29.886 --> 39:31.751
The old toilet ploy.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.654
And he takes off out the window.

39:34.690 --> 39:36.749
I've seen it 100 times. He thinks we'll fall for that?

39:36.792 --> 39:39.352
You must be kidding me. They must've planned for this.

39:42.294 --> 39:43.955
Look, there!

39:44.797 --> 39:46.730
Look where?

39:49.300 --> 39:50.733
You know how it works?

39:50.802 --> 39:52.826
Sure! It's child's play.

39:52.869 --> 39:54.734
There's a drainage pipe.

39:54.771 --> 39:59.833
And a clearage pipe. Simple.

39:59.875 --> 40:00.637
They showed us a training film about new equipment.

40:00.676 --> 40:02.643
Forget it.

40:02.977 --> 40:05.138
Hook it up. Keep him in your sights!

40:12.084 --> 40:15.052
Get some of that! It's wicked.

40:25.895 --> 40:28.625
A bit strong. I see giant worms.

40:30.065 --> 40:32.431
That connects to the water.

40:34.169 --> 40:36.432
And that goes in the toilet.

40:39.773 --> 40:41.239
Easy!

40:41.274 --> 40:44.243
- It's all ready. - You've scared me!

40:44.277 --> 40:45.334
Give me that!

40:45.377 --> 40:47.140
Sorry, I wasrt concentrating.

40:47.179 --> 40:49.340
So, concentrate a bit harder.

40:49.381 --> 40:52.144
Cops don't go playing with guns.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.710
This isn't a funfair, shooting for teddy bears.

40:55.786 --> 40:58.015
This thing's for real bears.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.522
Rule No. 1, when you're inside,

41:00.557 --> 41:03.320
finger on the trigger guard,

41:03.359 --> 41:05.623
gun held parallel, to avoid accidents.

41:07.061 --> 41:09.723
My foot!

41:13.267 --> 41:16.725
- Quick! - Grab that chair!

41:16.770 --> 41:19.533
- He's so heavy! - Put him there! Like carrying 3 people.

41:20.373 --> 41:22.136
Look at the state of him!

41:22.174 --> 41:23.731
Did he smoke the carpet?

41:23.775 --> 41:26.335
He took a hit of stuff for bears.

41:26.378 --> 41:27.504
For bears?

41:27.579 --> 41:29.603
- You give him that? - I gave him nothing.

41:29.680 --> 41:34.707
You morons! It's a dart, full of sedative.

41:34.751 --> 41:36.912
It'd put a bear to sleep. Wake him or he'll hibernate 6 months.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.319
That'd make 6 quiet months.

41:39.655 --> 41:41.816
Who signs your leave?

41:41.857 --> 41:43.518
Shit! Chief! Wake up!

41:43.558 --> 41:45.218
Time to get up!

41:45.259 --> 41:47.318
Red alert!

41:51.364 --> 41:53.229
Where were we?

41:53.867 --> 41:55.425
We'd got to "full name".

41:55.468 --> 41:57.935
All right, don't get as dumb as Gibert!

41:57.970 --> 41:59.528
Sorry.

41:59.571 --> 42:02.300
Spend all day with him, it starts to rub off.

42:02.373 --> 42:06.104
Did you enjoy your pee, my Belgian friend?

42:06.177 --> 42:08.303
You did your Maneken-Piss?

42:09.446 --> 42:11.107
Good one!

42:14.650 --> 42:16.117
OK, enough.

42:16.152 --> 42:18.915
He needed it. Look at his legs.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.818
That shouldn't happen.

42:21.756 --> 42:23.620
It should drain away.

42:23.657 --> 42:25.124
Looks like it's rising.

42:25.159 --> 42:27.525
Impossible. The water should run off.

42:27.561 --> 42:29.528
Maybe you got the pipes mixed up. I know I often do,

42:29.562 --> 42:31.621
but I took extra care.

42:31.664 --> 42:34.894
Drainage and clearage.

42:34.966 --> 42:36.797
It's not that then.

42:36.968 --> 42:39.095
We have a problem.

42:42.239 --> 42:44.503
I think I'd better check.

42:49.346 --> 42:51.404
I mixed them up again!

42:51.447 --> 42:53.506
What an idiot!

42:56.751 --> 42:58.309
I don't believe it! Is the water going down?

42:58.353 --> 42:59.217
Sure, look.

42:59.253 --> 43:02.221
He had geysers for eyes. Now, it's a trickle.

43:02.255 --> 43:04.120
Let's get him out before he drowns.

43:04.157 --> 43:08.092
No way, he's dangerous. Don't fool with him.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.095
If the Belgian drowns right here, who's the fool?

43:11.163 --> 43:12.789
Lt'd be like we killed him.

43:14.332 --> 43:16.892
There must be a fast-release system.

43:16.935 --> 43:20.097
Look for a switch or a lever.

43:20.337 --> 43:22.100
A chain?

43:22.339 --> 43:25.603
A handle! Quick, grab yours.

43:25.641 --> 43:28.303
Ready? 1, 2, 3...

43:35.149 --> 43:37.208
He looks in a bad way.

43:37.251 --> 43:39.309
Let's take his hood off.

43:39.352 --> 43:40.080
No, you do it.

43:40.153 --> 43:42.087
- Why me? - Move it!

43:53.131 --> 43:55.792
- It's a tight fit. - Take it easy.

44:01.337 --> 44:02.702
That's funny.

44:02.738 --> 44:03.796
He's not how I imagined.

44:03.839 --> 44:04.396
Oh, yeah?

44:04.440 --> 44:09.399
I thought he'd have a face, y'know, with huge teeth and jaws...

44:09.444 --> 44:11.105
- A real yeti? - More or less.

44:11.146 --> 44:14.080
The meanest killers look totally normal.

44:14.148 --> 44:16.082
Wake him up.

44:18.351 --> 44:19.079
What the heck?

44:19.152 --> 44:20.483
Precautions.

44:27.926 --> 44:31.488
Sir?

44:32.229 --> 44:34.890
Wake up!

44:39.234 --> 44:42.499
- There, he's better! - That's great.

44:42.537 --> 44:44.595
I'm pleased.

44:47.641 --> 44:48.369
Where am I?

44:48.442 --> 44:50.875
Marseille central police station.

44:54.114 --> 44:56.377
And you guys are cops?

44:58.417 --> 45:00.385
Soon we'll be lieutenants.

45:00.419 --> 45:02.886
You'll be lieutenants soon?

45:06.223 --> 45:08.384
- Bouches-du-Rhone? - Flyswatter, first.

45:10.427 --> 45:11.791
Stop hitting me!

45:11.827 --> 45:13.590
- Stop! - Listen...

45:13.629 --> 45:16.792
There's been a terrible mistake

45:16.832 --> 45:19.391
that is the fault of the police in my country.

45:29.609 --> 45:32.169
Albert Vandenbosh, wanted by Interpol,

45:32.211 --> 45:34.678
convicted in 17 countries. Remember?

45:34.713 --> 45:35.873
Of course. That's the problem.

45:35.914 --> 45:38.382
I'm not Vandenbosh,

45:38.416 --> 45:42.078
but Eugene Triboulet, embassy attache.

45:44.621 --> 45:46.384
He's trying to con us.

45:46.422 --> 45:48.890
1987. The Paris-Bruges train heist.

45:48.925 --> 45:51.392
I've committed no crime. I'm an attache.

45:51.426 --> 45:54.862
You're a hell of a case! Don't try to fool us.

45:54.930 --> 45:57.955
Let's knock out a report for the chief.

45:58.032 --> 45:59.465
He'll enjoy reading it.

45:59.534 --> 46:00.966
I'll get on it.

46:01.001 --> 46:02.559
Take this down.

46:02.602 --> 46:04.365
Albert Vandenbosh...

46:04.404 --> 46:05.871
Eugene Triboulet!

46:05.906 --> 46:08.669
I met Vandenbosh. Look at his photo.

46:08.707 --> 46:11.073
I don't look anything like him. He's a thug! Yeah, right.

46:12.410 --> 46:13.968
Emilien?

46:14.012 --> 46:15.877
Take a look.

46:20.317 --> 46:22.284
Who's that?

46:22.318 --> 46:23.979
Albert Vandenbosh.

46:24.019 --> 46:25.179
See? I told you.

46:25.221 --> 46:27.848
I know it's not your fault. Release me

46:27.922 --> 46:29.947
and I won't sue.

46:31.226 --> 46:32.853
How'd you know Vandenbosh?

46:32.927 --> 46:34.951
I don't actually know him.

46:34.995 --> 46:36.963
I saw him at Bruges police station.

46:36.997 --> 46:38.554
What were you doing?

46:38.598 --> 46:39.860
Making a complaint.

46:39.899 --> 46:41.764
I'd been carjacked.

46:41.801 --> 46:42.165
What?

46:42.201 --> 46:44.361
They carjacked my Toyota.

46:44.402 --> 46:47.064
Dragged me out and drove away.

46:47.105 --> 46:49.766
In Marseille, it's called a Parisian.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.775
We call it carjacking!

46:51.809 --> 46:52.571
- Carjacking... - Carjacking...

46:52.610 --> 46:53.770
OK, what happened next?

46:53.811 --> 46:57.371
I was in the chief's office. Charming man...

46:57.413 --> 47:00.745
When I had to go to the toilet.

47:01.316 --> 47:03.341
You're always peeing!

47:03.518 --> 47:05.452
Yes, since my prostate operation.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.749
- Sorry. - Then what?

47:08.489 --> 47:11.252
In the stalls, I ran into Vandenbosh,

47:11.290 --> 47:13.258
shucking that horrible suit.

47:13.292 --> 47:15.556
3 thugs jumped on me

47:15.595 --> 47:17.755
and forced me inside there.

47:17.796 --> 47:19.457
I put up a fight,

47:19.498 --> 47:21.864
but they soon gagged me

47:21.900 --> 47:22.957
and from then on

47:23.000 --> 47:25.264
I was powerless to resist.

47:25.302 --> 47:27.361
You're very good.

47:27.404 --> 47:30.566
But unfortunately for you, you've met your match.

47:30.607 --> 47:32.268
- Emilien? - What now?

47:32.308 --> 47:33.865
Check this out.

47:41.282 --> 47:42.943
Belgian Embassy Fenimore Eugene Tribloulet.

47:42.984 --> 47:45.543
Cultural attache, Belgian Embassy. Since 1996.

47:45.585 --> 47:49.350
Since May 17, 1996, to be precise.

47:49.388 --> 47:52.050
My appointment even got a mention on the RTBF news.

47:52.091 --> 47:54.559
- Is there a phone number? - There.

47:54.593 --> 47:56.059
Call them up.

47:56.094 --> 47:57.356
Action!

48:03.100 --> 48:05.068
Belgian Embassy, how can I help?

48:05.102 --> 48:07.262
Mr. Triboulet, please?

48:07.303 --> 48:09.828
Sorry, he's been away for 3 days.

48:09.906 --> 48:13.238
You don't know where he's gone?

48:13.308 --> 48:15.037
To be honest, no.

48:15.076 --> 48:19.535
He hasn't called in at all and the whole Embassy's worried about him.

48:19.580 --> 48:20.740
He's disappeared?

48:20.781 --> 48:23.442
It seems so. He was in Bruges in Tuesday

48:23.483 --> 48:26.452
and got his car carjacked.

48:26.486 --> 48:29.352
Since then, no news of him.

48:29.388 --> 48:32.754
- Are you a relation? - No.

48:33.691 --> 48:35.352
That's awful.

48:35.393 --> 48:38.259
Thanks, I'll call back.

48:40.597 --> 48:42.224
What a balls-up!

48:44.099 --> 48:45.828
Talk, damn you!

48:46.302 --> 48:48.532
Take it easy!

48:48.571 --> 48:50.435
I have my eye on them.

48:50.471 --> 48:53.440
Don't burn the place down.

48:53.474 --> 48:56.636
Nobody got any clothes for our prisoner?

48:56.677 --> 49:00.043
Check the closet. The boss always keeps spares.

49:01.681 --> 49:04.741
No kidding. He can change 10 times a day.

49:05.884 --> 49:08.444
Daniel! Good timing.

49:08.486 --> 49:09.453
Is there a problem?

49:09.487 --> 49:12.455
I'd like it if you could sign the armistice.

49:26.793 --> 49:28.123
Die!

49:33.464 --> 49:34.829
Get lost!

49:35.865 --> 49:37.423
Check this out.

49:41.968 --> 49:43.128
Great!

49:43.170 --> 49:46.627
I'd rather die in glory than surrender in shame.

49:48.873 --> 49:50.636
What's that?

49:53.578 --> 49:56.137
Peace! War's over!

50:03.184 --> 50:04.617
Okay, General?

50:04.686 --> 50:07.017
I'm fine.

50:08.355 --> 50:12.017
I may have lost a battle, but I haven't lost the war.

50:12.058 --> 50:16.016
Can the rematch wait? They have homework to do.

50:16.061 --> 50:19.121
Yes, of course. On Sunday, perhaps.

50:19.164 --> 50:20.631
That's right. The Lord's Day!

50:20.665 --> 50:22.029
He'll be delighted.

50:22.066 --> 50:26.526
And we'll have apple pie.

50:26.570 --> 50:28.036
I'll take care of it.

50:28.071 --> 50:30.039
You two, in the car!

50:32.773 --> 50:36.209
2 quiet hours? You destroyed his living room!

50:36.277 --> 50:38.710
He started it. We wanted to play drafts.

50:38.778 --> 50:41.008
He said only swishes play drafts.

50:41.081 --> 50:43.514
Swishes? He said that?

50:43.649 --> 50:45.310
You know what swishes do?

50:45.350 --> 50:47.818
Sure. It's when you squish flies.

50:47.853 --> 50:51.219
Dad says they never stop swishing at work.

50:55.158 --> 50:59.026
The flies have been bulking up. They're bigger than bees.

51:01.263 --> 51:03.322
He's well-built, your chief.

51:03.365 --> 51:06.527
He's bulky, all right. But it suits you.

51:06.568 --> 51:09.128
Not quite my style, but it'll do.

51:09.170 --> 51:11.000
Better than that diving suit!

51:11.071 --> 51:12.800
For sure.

51:18.144 --> 51:21.011
Look at the size of that one!

51:24.349 --> 51:25.714
- What are you on? - Sorry!

51:25.751 --> 51:29.413
There was a fly right there. It was gigantic!

51:30.254 --> 51:34.019
Giant flies and worms, I know. Take some herb tea.

51:34.057 --> 51:35.615
I swear! Where'd it go?

51:35.859 --> 51:38.622
You're compulsive squishers!

51:38.660 --> 51:40.025
You got us wrong.

51:40.062 --> 51:43.690
It's because our chief loves fly-fishing, you see?

51:43.765 --> 51:48.394
It's his birthday soon, so we're collecting for him.

51:48.468 --> 51:50.800
It's a surprise.

51:52.038 --> 51:53.699
Sorry, excuse me.

51:54.239 --> 51:56.298
Can we give you a ride?

51:56.341 --> 51:59.207
No, I'll take a cab.

52:00.144 --> 52:01.907
Goodbye.

52:02.346 --> 52:04.007
Our apologies, huh?

52:09.752 --> 52:11.719
- Denial, are you here? - Is Emilien done?

52:11.753 --> 52:13.618
Another hour.

52:13.655 --> 52:16.919
Tell him I'll get the pizzas and meet him at mine.

52:16.957 --> 52:18.288
Okay, I'll tell him.

52:18.358 --> 52:19.791
- Bye. - Thanks.

52:28.733 --> 52:31.497
Fine timing! I need a means of transport.

52:31.536 --> 52:33.196
Where can I transport you?

52:33.237 --> 52:34.898
4, Mediterranean Square.

52:34.938 --> 52:35.700
Nice address.

52:35.739 --> 52:37.797
- Can I ask a favor? - Your wishes...

52:37.840 --> 52:40.206
I know you go at your own pace here

52:40.243 --> 52:42.507
because the sun makes you sleepy,

52:42.545 --> 52:44.705
but the surs gone down,

52:44.746 --> 52:46.509
so I don't want to see the sights.

52:46.548 --> 52:48.515
Would you kindly floor it to make the transport brief?

52:48.549 --> 52:50.983
Get it? Transport, port?

52:51.052 --> 52:53.486
Marseille port?

52:53.553 --> 52:54.485
Not bad, huh?

52:54.554 --> 52:57.182
Belt up, smartass!

52:57.257 --> 52:58.781
I beg your pardon.

53:00.626 --> 53:03.686
- Gross! - That stinks!

53:03.729 --> 53:05.992
I apologize.

53:06.030 --> 53:07.895
You got it all over me!

53:18.834 --> 53:20.301
Have fun in Marseille!

53:20.335 --> 53:21.699
Goodbye, ma'am.

53:33.542 --> 53:36.773
Delta 1. The sardine's in the tin.

53:36.846 --> 53:38.369
Over to you, Delta 3.

53:38.446 --> 53:39.970
10/4. Cast the bait.

53:43.317 --> 53:44.682
Here goes!

53:44.718 --> 53:46.982
It beats that greasy outfit that stank of sardines.

53:47.020 --> 53:49.487
- You got the gear? - Everything.

53:49.522 --> 53:50.682
And the specialist?

53:50.723 --> 53:54.681
It wasrt easy finding good help here. Actually...

53:54.726 --> 53:57.593
Serge! I didn't ask how great you were,

53:57.629 --> 53:59.493
but if you found a specialist.

53:59.530 --> 54:00.292
The best!

54:00.331 --> 54:02.697
Let me be the judge of that.

54:02.733 --> 54:05.496
Sure. I said you'd want to see for yourself.

54:06.836 --> 54:08.463
That's him now!

54:21.814 --> 54:23.475
Kiss or shake hands?

54:23.516 --> 54:25.381
I prefer a kiss.

54:27.419 --> 54:29.683
In Belgium, it's 3 times.

54:32.022 --> 54:33.887
I'm honored to work for you.

54:33.924 --> 54:36.085
- You know my work? - "Work" is too ugly.

54:36.126 --> 54:38.787
I prefer the word "deeds".

54:38.828 --> 54:40.193
She's good!

54:40.230 --> 54:41.595
When do we begin?

54:41.631 --> 54:44.565
Not so fast. I like flattery,

54:44.633 --> 54:47.863
but I have a little test for you.

54:48.703 --> 54:51.570
I'll close my eyes and you must try,

54:51.606 --> 54:55.769
if you can, to take something without me noticing.

54:55.809 --> 54:58.073
You have one minute!

54:59.311 --> 55:01.279
I reset it.

55:01.313 --> 55:02.871
It was a minute slow.

55:03.916 --> 55:06.782
- She's really good. - Is she in-house?

55:12.520 --> 55:16.580
We've been through all the regions. He's not interested.

55:16.623 --> 55:18.648
There's only one solution.

55:18.725 --> 55:21.249
- Here's the doc. - Where's the bear?

55:24.597 --> 55:26.564
His nose is dry.

55:26.598 --> 55:30.056
He's not a bear. He got a dose of bear tranquilizer.

55:30.101 --> 55:33.263
I thought I'd never seen one like him.

55:34.404 --> 55:36.269
I have an antidote.

55:36.306 --> 55:39.763
It's for elephants, but it works on bears.

55:40.009 --> 55:41.476
Are you sure about this?

55:41.510 --> 55:42.976
It's a question of aiming

55:43.011 --> 55:47.470
just above the trunk between the eyes.

55:49.516 --> 55:51.950
I'm right here, chief.

55:52.019 --> 55:53.042
What's wrong with him?

55:53.119 --> 55:54.746
It's normal.

55:54.821 --> 55:57.449
He needs to stay in his basket.

55:59.790 --> 56:03.556
I must have dozed off. What time is it?

56:03.594 --> 56:04.560
5 past 12.

56:04.594 --> 56:07.563
That explains it. I could eat a horse.

56:07.597 --> 56:08.757
You want pizza?

56:08.798 --> 56:10.662
- I wouldn't say no. - Coming up.

56:10.699 --> 56:14.362
I had an absurd dream and you were in it.

56:14.403 --> 56:19.465
You let the Belgian bamboozle you and he walked free.

56:19.507 --> 56:23.374
I have some weird dreams sometimes.

56:23.410 --> 56:25.378
This can't be...

56:26.312 --> 56:27.643
Emilien?

56:48.796 --> 56:52.459
You won't believe what happened.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.865
- You got fired? - You know?

56:54.901 --> 56:56.869
You get fired once a month.

56:57.103 --> 56:58.660
This time it's serious.

56:58.704 --> 57:00.331
Remember public enemy No. 1?

57:00.405 --> 57:02.032
The guy transferred via Marseille?

57:02.107 --> 57:03.438
- And? - I let him walk free.

57:03.508 --> 57:04.633
- This can't be true. L- No.

57:04.709 --> 57:07.143
I mean, he escaped. I'm such an idiot!

57:07.178 --> 57:08.645
A real numbskull!

57:08.679 --> 57:11.238
It's not just my skull. All over.

57:11.281 --> 57:13.442
I just keep messing up.

57:13.483 --> 57:16.144
I could write a dictionary of stupidity.

57:16.185 --> 57:17.447
Don't exaggerate.

57:17.486 --> 57:20.750
You bag some biggies. The Santa gang? China Girl?

57:20.788 --> 57:22.653
That was just luck!

57:23.291 --> 57:24.849
I'm useless.

57:24.892 --> 57:27.860
Gibert was right to take my badge. I don't deserve it.

57:27.894 --> 57:29.657
Same goes for most cops.

57:29.696 --> 57:32.163
I became a cop for my Dad's sake.

57:32.198 --> 57:34.325
It was his dying wish.

57:34.400 --> 57:38.836
It's tough, but at least you tried.

57:38.903 --> 57:40.336
Yeah, you're right.

57:41.072 --> 57:44.837
It's time to move on. Do something I want to do.

57:44.875 --> 57:47.638
That's a positive attitude.

57:47.677 --> 57:50.145
What do you want to do?

57:50.179 --> 57:53.443
That's the problem. I like my job.

57:53.482 --> 57:55.347
It's the best in the world.

57:55.383 --> 57:58.647
I see. You really are in the shit.

57:58.886 --> 58:01.252
If only I could find the Belgian.

58:01.288 --> 58:03.153
I'd get my badge back.

58:03.190 --> 58:04.850
- What Belgian? - The perp. He's Belgian.

58:04.891 --> 58:07.621
Big mouth? Fisherman?

58:09.294 --> 58:11.228
Exactly.

58:11.296 --> 58:12.126
Have you seen him?

58:12.197 --> 58:14.426
I picked him up outside the station.

58:14.465 --> 58:17.025
That's him. He said he'd take a cab.

58:17.068 --> 58:18.626
Pretty spectacular escape.

58:18.669 --> 58:20.431
Was the police band playing?

58:20.470 --> 58:22.438
Do you remember where he went?

58:22.472 --> 58:25.736
- Of course. - You're a genius!

58:27.676 --> 58:29.041
- Emilien? - Why?

58:29.078 --> 58:30.840
What about the kids?

58:32.280 --> 58:35.249
Shit! The kids. You got an idea?

58:37.384 --> 58:40.615
Is it Sunday already?

58:40.687 --> 58:41.618
Sure it is.

58:41.687 --> 58:43.712
Here are the kids, I'll get the pie.

58:43.790 --> 58:46.917
Fine. I'll put the oven on.

58:55.366 --> 58:58.630
- You're sure it's here? - Yes. No. 4.

58:58.668 --> 59:00.829
We need to check they're still here.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.428
They are.

59:02.472 --> 59:04.132
Are you sure? It looks empty.

59:04.173 --> 59:08.632
They're asleep like everybody else, except us two fools.

59:10.478 --> 59:12.639
Does that mean that I am not normal?

59:13.281 --> 59:15.111
And their car's still there.

59:15.182 --> 59:18.913
You'd have made a good cop. Is that a compliment?

59:18.985 --> 59:22.010
Sure. As a kid, you must have played cops and robbers.

59:22.054 --> 59:24.022
Sure, but I was always on the other team.

59:24.056 --> 59:25.818
If we have work to do tomorrow, I'll get some sleep.

59:25.857 --> 59:29.122
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on them.

59:41.469 --> 59:43.232
Emilien?

59:45.874 --> 59:47.602
Sorry, I dozed off.

59:47.675 --> 59:51.805
We have coffee, Quick Burgers,

59:51.879 --> 59:52.606
cheeseburgers, pies... Yogurt.

59:52.679 --> 59:53.703
You had that in the car?

59:53.746 --> 59:55.611
I bought it.

59:55.648 --> 59:58.115
You mean no one was watching the house?

59:58.150 --> 1:00:01.711
I was supposed to sleep while you kept watch.

1:00:01.753 --> 1:00:03.720
Your snoring kept me awake.

1:00:03.754 --> 1:00:05.813
- Maybe they took off? - They didn't take off.

1:00:05.857 --> 1:00:08.018
The car's still there.

1:00:08.059 --> 1:00:10.925
Another arrived an hour ago with 2 guys in it.

1:00:10.961 --> 1:00:12.428
Why didn't you wake me?

1:00:12.462 --> 1:00:15.328
You sleeping gives me a break. Even if you snore.

1:00:15.364 --> 1:00:17.730
They're coming out.

1:00:20.268 --> 1:00:21.394
There's the Belgian!

1:00:21.469 --> 1:00:24.097
It's not him. Mine was a lot younger.

1:00:24.172 --> 1:00:26.401
He's in disguise!

1:00:26.473 --> 1:00:28.907
Look, his mustache is dropping off.

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.907
Why'd he get dressed up to leave his own house?

1:00:31.944 --> 1:00:34.208
Maybe because the cops are after him.

1:00:34.246 --> 1:00:35.906
Absolutely right.

1:00:36.447 --> 1:00:39.007
There's something familiar about the girl.

1:00:46.356 --> 1:00:47.515
Never saw her before.

1:01:18.041 --> 1:01:20.304
- Where are they going? - Guess.

1:01:32.251 --> 1:01:35.708
Monaco! Banks all over. Heaven for a guy like him.

1:01:35.754 --> 1:01:37.085
A tax haven, you mean.

1:01:37.155 --> 1:01:41.682
Tell me about it. We'd just love to access some vaults here.

1:01:41.759 --> 1:01:43.693
Shall I ask the Belgian to help?

1:01:43.727 --> 1:01:46.194
After all you did for him, he owes you.

1:01:46.229 --> 1:01:47.696
Cut it out!

1:01:57.137 --> 1:01:59.105
Here we go...

1:01:59.739 --> 1:02:01.001
He's chosen one.

1:02:09.948 --> 1:02:11.575
Royal Bank of Belgium.

1:02:11.649 --> 1:02:13.082
He must be homesick.

1:02:13.151 --> 1:02:14.981
They're gonna hold it up?

1:02:15.052 --> 1:02:16.781
They're not playing boules.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:17.582
I'll call Gibert.

1:02:17.621 --> 1:02:20.384
Shouldrt you wait to have some proof?

1:02:20.423 --> 1:02:22.482
No sweat! We'll get the proof later.

1:02:22.525 --> 1:02:23.685
Chief? It's Emilien.

1:02:23.726 --> 1:02:26.387
I've got the Belgian. I've spotted him at least.

1:02:26.428 --> 1:02:28.988
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

1:02:29.030 --> 1:02:31.691
I was taking a walk

1:02:32.433 --> 1:02:34.196
and I saw him enter a bank.

1:02:34.735 --> 1:02:38.602
They're not playing boules. It's the RBB in Monaco.

1:02:39.439 --> 1:02:41.702
I know it's far. I'll try to tie them up.

1:02:42.541 --> 1:02:44.566
- He's on his way. - Great!

1:02:44.643 --> 1:02:46.769
The joker vs. Scooby-Doo.

1:02:47.644 --> 1:02:50.078
Can I help you?

1:02:50.147 --> 1:02:52.171
I'm here to see my son, Edouard.

1:02:52.215 --> 1:02:53.682
You're Triboulet's father?

1:02:53.716 --> 1:02:55.877
- That's right. - He'll be so pleased.

1:02:55.918 --> 1:02:57.782
2nd floor, room 115.

1:02:57.819 --> 1:02:59.286
Thank you.

1:02:59.821 --> 1:03:02.380
This way. They're friendly here.

1:03:04.225 --> 1:03:06.090
Come in.

1:03:08.228 --> 1:03:09.593
Dad?

1:03:09.629 --> 1:03:11.597
Idiot! Dad died 4 years ago.

1:03:11.631 --> 1:03:13.598
He'd be ashamed of you

1:03:13.632 --> 1:03:15.691
for changing names.

1:03:15.734 --> 1:03:17.292
Brother...

1:03:17.736 --> 1:03:19.669
- I thought you were in prison. - Not this week.

1:03:19.737 --> 1:03:22.262
Prisors like a country home.

1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:24.170
I go there to rest up.

1:03:29.212 --> 1:03:31.873
Let's have a look at you.

1:03:32.615 --> 1:03:35.174
Still that stupid haircut. You never change!

1:03:35.216 --> 1:03:38.185
Girls like men with hair that's virile.

1:03:38.219 --> 1:03:39.584
A bit like me.

1:03:40.621 --> 1:03:42.179
You're still single?

1:03:42.222 --> 1:03:43.883
Yes.

1:04:18.406 --> 1:04:20.374
Delta 1 in position.

1:04:20.408 --> 1:04:22.569
10/4, Delta 2.

1:04:24.811 --> 1:04:27.075
The girl's going in.

1:04:27.114 --> 1:04:29.775
I know I've seen her before.

1:04:30.917 --> 1:04:32.077
I'm going in.

1:04:32.118 --> 1:04:34.279
Fine, Delta 2. Got you on visual.

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:38.153
It's heating up. What if I take a discreet look?

1:04:38.223 --> 1:04:40.452
You don't do discreet.

1:04:40.524 --> 1:04:42.856
We sit tight and wait for Scooby-Doo.

1:04:46.195 --> 1:04:46.854
Welcome!

1:04:46.896 --> 1:04:50.059
I'm opening an account with Mr. Triboulet.

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.263
I'll call him for you.

1:04:59.807 --> 1:05:01.775
Go on, answer it.

1:05:03.109 --> 1:05:06.476
- It's a client? - Go down.

1:05:06.513 --> 1:05:08.377
I won't get in your way.

1:05:08.414 --> 1:05:10.143
I'll be right down.

1:05:10.215 --> 1:05:11.648
Right away.

1:05:12.717 --> 1:05:16.050
Give me the keys. I'll go instead of you.

1:05:16.087 --> 1:05:19.055
I only have the keys to empty boxes.

1:05:21.091 --> 1:05:23.150
I open accounts.

1:05:23.193 --> 1:05:25.057
That's good. Me, too.

1:05:30.098 --> 1:05:33.158
Sorry to keep you waiting, Countess. This way, please.

1:05:37.705 --> 1:05:39.764
- Open up. - Yes, Mr. Triboulet.

1:05:47.112 --> 1:05:49.046
After you, Countess.

1:06:04.093 --> 1:06:05.856
Good job!

1:06:06.895 --> 1:06:08.452
It's all yours, Countess.

1:06:12.899 --> 1:06:15.265
Where'd you like to start?

1:06:16.703 --> 1:06:17.431
That wall.

1:06:17.504 --> 1:06:20.336
On that wall, we have No. 82. How's that suit you?

1:06:21.307 --> 1:06:22.638
Perfectly.

1:06:36.885 --> 1:06:38.443
Are they biting?

1:06:38.487 --> 1:06:40.750
I'm tracking the alarm connections.

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:43.348
I have to deactivate them

1:06:43.391 --> 1:06:45.358
or it'll go off in Security.

1:06:45.392 --> 1:06:47.656
She blows me away.

1:06:47.694 --> 1:06:51.424
No kidding! How about some food? I'm starving.

1:06:51.497 --> 1:06:53.021
I'll go find something.

1:07:01.672 --> 1:07:04.232
What's Gibert up to? It's been an hour.

1:07:04.275 --> 1:07:06.334
- I've spoilt you. - That's true.

1:07:06.677 --> 1:07:09.645
And an hour to open an account?

1:07:09.679 --> 1:07:11.340
Or several accounts.

1:07:12.681 --> 1:07:14.740
Here's the list of boxes.

1:07:14.783 --> 1:07:17.650
It'll take a while. Grab a coffee.

1:07:17.685 --> 1:07:19.152
A coffee?

1:07:35.867 --> 1:07:39.325
The Free Belgian? Pretty classy.

1:07:39.370 --> 1:07:41.428
At your Majesty's service.

1:07:51.179 --> 1:07:52.646
First box open.

1:07:52.681 --> 1:07:54.842
Keep going, Delta 2.

1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:09.427
What?

1:08:09.461 --> 1:08:13.419
A guy in a suit gets into a van at 9 a. m. Is that normal?

1:08:13.464 --> 1:08:16.024
A Dutch guy getting back from a club.

1:08:16.067 --> 1:08:19.331
Loaded up with food, when the van sells Fries?

1:08:19.369 --> 1:08:21.337
Maybe his suck.

1:08:21.371 --> 1:08:23.133
Smart ass.

1:08:23.172 --> 1:08:24.935
That's why I'm a cop.

1:08:37.779 --> 1:08:40.303
Just five left. I need info.

1:08:40.380 --> 1:08:42.211
OK, hold tight a second.

1:08:47.753 --> 1:08:50.017
Number 107. Box 107.

1:08:50.056 --> 1:08:52.523
- 1-0-7. - 10/4.

1:09:00.564 --> 1:09:02.827
- A black notebook? - Affirmative.

1:09:07.669 --> 1:09:10.001
- You gave me a fright? - How's it going?

1:09:10.072 --> 1:09:12.198
- Just five left. - Let's move it!

1:09:12.273 --> 1:09:13.797
Of course.

1:09:17.344 --> 1:09:18.311
Are you done?

1:09:18.345 --> 1:09:20.404
Getting there.

1:09:20.447 --> 1:09:23.904
His head's smaller than yours, boss. The wig keeps slipping.

1:09:23.949 --> 1:09:26.213
Stop getting there and get him out.

1:09:26.251 --> 1:09:27.309
Dumbhead!

1:09:27.353 --> 1:09:30.810
Stop getting there and get your mustache on.

1:09:30.855 --> 1:09:32.618
I got yelled at.

1:09:32.657 --> 1:09:33.816
- Really? - I'm true.

1:09:33.857 --> 1:09:36.325
Stopped for lunch?

1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:37.918
Wouldrt surprise me.

1:09:39.562 --> 1:09:41.029
Look!

1:09:42.465 --> 1:09:44.194
We're gonna lose him!

1:09:44.266 --> 1:09:45.197
What?

1:09:45.266 --> 1:09:48.497
He's leaving disguised as an old man. Where are you?

1:09:48.570 --> 1:09:51.697
The driver's asking for directions.

1:09:51.739 --> 1:09:54.503
But people here run away when they see a cop.

1:09:54.541 --> 1:09:58.408
And the GPS is on the fritz. It says "Maubeuge".

1:09:59.746 --> 1:10:02.213
- And now? - Straight to the beach.

1:10:02.247 --> 1:10:04.613
Watch the sea and count to 100,000.

1:10:04.649 --> 1:10:06.309
- OK, fine. - Seeya, sucker!

1:10:06.350 --> 1:10:09.410
You're gonna miss him. He's walking away.

1:10:09.453 --> 1:10:11.318
- It's right there. - Really?

1:10:13.256 --> 1:10:15.588
What's he wearing?

1:10:25.332 --> 1:10:27.800
- What do we do? - It's the wrong one.

1:10:28.134 --> 1:10:29.499
I'm not him!

1:10:29.535 --> 1:10:32.402
I'm not me, either. Take him in!

1:10:32.438 --> 1:10:34.302
I swear I'm not!

1:10:34.339 --> 1:10:36.603
- Emilien? - Yes, chief?

1:10:36.642 --> 1:10:39.508
Meet me at the office. I have your badge.

1:10:39.543 --> 1:10:41.204
Thanks, chief.

1:10:41.245 --> 1:10:42.610
Hear that? It's great news!

1:10:43.047 --> 1:10:46.504
All thanks to you. How can I thank you?

1:10:46.549 --> 1:10:47.914
This stinks.

1:10:47.951 --> 1:10:50.578
No, he's sorry. He knows I'm a good cop.

1:10:50.653 --> 1:10:52.587
Not that. The Belgian.

1:10:52.655 --> 1:10:55.179
6 of them in 2 cars with bags.

1:10:55.256 --> 1:10:57.281
And only two come out. On foot.

1:10:57.325 --> 1:10:59.486
How'd you explain that one?

1:10:59.927 --> 1:11:02.793
Nope, that one's a toughie.

1:11:02.829 --> 1:11:05.491
And the old guy's limp was different.

1:11:05.532 --> 1:11:07.294
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

1:11:07.333 --> 1:11:10.894
He maybe fell down some stairs. Old folks often do.

1:11:10.936 --> 1:11:12.800
It wasrt the same guy.

1:11:13.838 --> 1:11:15.100
Really?

1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:18.108
If that wasrt the Belgian, where is he?

1:11:19.543 --> 1:11:21.807
Look!

1:11:24.247 --> 1:11:25.771
What a balls-up!

1:11:25.848 --> 1:11:28.873
I'll go a different way. Meet you at the house.

1:11:28.950 --> 1:11:31.475
No way! We're in this together.

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:34.977
Anyway, now I'm rich and single.

1:11:35.022 --> 1:11:36.785
Sounds tempting.

1:11:37.625 --> 1:11:39.285
He won't let her go.

1:11:39.325 --> 1:11:41.885
- We follow them? - In your fries van?

1:11:44.530 --> 1:11:45.895
What are you waiting for?

1:11:45.931 --> 1:11:47.592
Giving them a start's more fun.

1:11:47.633 --> 1:11:50.999
This is no time forjokes. Let's go!

1:12:11.013 --> 1:12:12.479
They're going slow!

1:12:12.514 --> 1:12:15.779
Makes a change to admire the countryside.

1:12:15.817 --> 1:12:17.579
They'll see us.

1:12:17.618 --> 1:12:19.882
We're less obvious than the van.

1:12:21.121 --> 1:12:22.678
Who are those guys?

1:12:22.722 --> 1:12:25.384
Monaco's caviar, not fries.

1:12:25.425 --> 1:12:28.985
When he saw Belgian plates, he thought he'd get a sale.

1:12:29.027 --> 1:12:32.394
Cut out the jokes! I'm in deep shit here.

1:12:32.431 --> 1:12:34.591
Why? You got your card back.

1:12:34.632 --> 1:12:38.465
You think so? Gibert'll find out it's the wrong Belgian.

1:12:39.636 --> 1:12:42.571
I'm Edouard Triboulet of the Royal Bank of Belgium.

1:12:42.605 --> 1:12:46.062
And I'm Hercule Poirot. Where did we get to?

1:12:47.109 --> 1:12:48.076
No. 77, chief.

1:12:48.110 --> 1:12:50.168
That's Seine-et-Marne.

1:12:50.211 --> 1:12:52.975
A beautiful region, you'll see.

1:12:53.715 --> 1:12:55.477
Worth a visit?

1:12:55.515 --> 1:12:57.983
Let's try again. Full name?

1:12:58.018 --> 1:13:01.384
I'm Edouard...

1:13:01.420 --> 1:13:04.389
We're running out of regions, chief.

1:13:04.423 --> 1:13:07.084
We can move onto my encyclopedia in 22 volumes.

1:13:07.125 --> 1:13:09.150
I'm not so sure...

1:13:09.227 --> 1:13:13.356
I was thinking. He's Belgian,

1:13:13.430 --> 1:13:16.455
so we could try another method.

1:13:16.499 --> 1:13:19.366
- If you see what I mean? - Good thinking!

1:13:19.402 --> 1:13:22.165
- Everybody out! - No!

1:13:22.204 --> 1:13:23.865
Please, don't leave me alone with him!

1:13:23.905 --> 1:13:26.965
Please, stay!

1:13:31.712 --> 1:13:33.770
So, you're Belgian?

1:13:33.813 --> 1:13:35.872
Yes, from Brussels.

1:13:40.919 --> 1:13:43.353
Jacques Brel? Wasrt he Belgian?

1:13:43.422 --> 1:13:46.151
Yes, a great man. A hero.

1:13:46.224 --> 1:13:48.055
Let's hear the hero.

1:14:05.006 --> 1:14:07.064
Beautiful, isn't it?

1:14:07.107 --> 1:14:10.167
- Wonderful. - Even better like that!

1:14:11.010 --> 1:14:12.773
Not that! Mercy!

1:14:12.812 --> 1:14:16.338
Stop!

1:14:18.917 --> 1:14:21.351
Not that!

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:23.046
Full name?

1:14:23.087 --> 1:14:25.351
Help!

1:14:25.389 --> 1:14:28.152
- Tough cookie! - Regions are easier.

1:14:38.393 --> 1:14:39.951
Shit!

1:14:40.495 --> 1:14:42.861
The fryer's frazzled.

1:14:49.299 --> 1:14:50.357
We're not going to the house?

1:14:50.400 --> 1:14:52.561
We're won'th more.

1:14:52.602 --> 1:14:54.069
Call the Colombian.

1:15:02.410 --> 1:15:03.934
The Belgian for you.

1:15:03.978 --> 1:15:05.137
You're out?

1:15:05.179 --> 1:15:08.342
I can send you down for years.

1:15:09.383 --> 1:15:10.350
Talk.

1:15:10.384 --> 1:15:12.442
Know the Royal Bank of Belgium?

1:15:12.485 --> 1:15:13.349
Go on!

1:15:13.386 --> 1:15:16.354
The notebook in your box is in my hands.

1:15:17.789 --> 1:15:20.656
You drown in your fine pool?

1:15:20.692 --> 1:15:22.955
- What do you want? - Not much.

1:15:22.993 --> 1:15:26.656
You have 10 minutes to get on your yacht and go home.

1:15:28.898 --> 1:15:32.628
Bingo! I just bought a shack you'll like.

1:16:05.287 --> 1:16:06.652
I love it!

1:16:06.688 --> 1:16:09.054
I came here once to see the Colombian

1:16:09.091 --> 1:16:11.456
and I fell in love with the place.

1:16:15.096 --> 1:16:17.120
He refused to sell.

1:16:19.165 --> 1:16:21.133
C'mon, I'll show you paradise.

1:16:26.472 --> 1:16:28.530
Check that out! Amazing!

1:16:28.573 --> 1:16:30.040
Follow me.

1:16:39.882 --> 1:16:42.350
What did I tell you? Paradise!

1:16:54.861 --> 1:16:56.829
Fresh, natural produce, see?

1:16:56.863 --> 1:17:00.127
Not like the flour you get in the city.

1:17:00.866 --> 1:17:04.324
You turned me on in the bank, popping open those boxes.

1:17:04.369 --> 1:17:06.928
Eugene, isn't this a bit sudden?

1:17:06.971 --> 1:17:08.836
No time to lose, kid.

1:17:08.873 --> 1:17:11.033
In our line of work, you gotta act fast.

1:17:11.074 --> 1:17:14.840
Any moment, we could both be dead. Make the most of it.

1:17:14.878 --> 1:17:17.141
- You're right, Eugene... - Call me Fenimore.

1:17:17.179 --> 1:17:21.410
Give me time to look my best for you.

1:17:21.482 --> 1:17:24.007
Great idea!

1:17:24.085 --> 1:17:26.416
We'll have a candlelit dinner overlooking the sea.

1:17:26.453 --> 1:17:28.114
That would be perfect.

1:17:30.257 --> 1:17:32.121
Be right back...

1:17:32.158 --> 1:17:34.023
Fenimore.

1:17:38.363 --> 1:17:41.526
Delta 1, get me out of here. The heat's on.

1:17:41.566 --> 1:17:43.328
How soon can you be here?

1:17:43.367 --> 1:17:44.527
Hold on.

1:17:44.568 --> 1:17:46.433
How long will it take to repair?

1:17:46.470 --> 1:17:49.632
Son, you're looking at 2-3 days.

1:17:49.672 --> 1:17:53.005
Delta 2, I'm sending reinforcements.

1:17:56.978 --> 1:17:58.002
What are you doing?

1:17:58.080 --> 1:17:59.603
Calling up reinforcements.

1:18:02.450 --> 1:18:05.213
We did it! The Belgiars confessed.

1:18:05.251 --> 1:18:08.311
- He confessed? - Everything.

1:18:08.354 --> 1:18:10.321
We couldn't stop him.

1:18:10.355 --> 1:18:12.323
We also took the opportunity to close some other cases.

1:18:12.357 --> 1:18:15.621
He's going down so long, he'll never know.

1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:17.025
That's not the right Belgian.

1:18:17.061 --> 1:18:18.119
How come?

1:18:18.162 --> 1:18:19.823
He was a decoy.

1:18:19.864 --> 1:18:21.125
The real one was still in the bank.

1:18:21.164 --> 1:18:23.325
So where's the real Belgian now?

1:18:23.366 --> 1:18:26.801
I tailed him to the Colombiars villa outside Cannes.

1:18:26.869 --> 1:18:30.100
Both of them together. The arrest of the century!

1:18:30.172 --> 1:18:32.799
Red alert!

1:18:39.847 --> 1:18:41.212
You look sublime, darling.

1:18:41.248 --> 1:18:43.807
And you... White suits you.

1:18:43.850 --> 1:18:48.115
You think so? I like white.

1:18:48.153 --> 1:18:50.314
I like white a lot, but I prefer champagne.

1:18:55.459 --> 1:18:57.427
- Gunshots? - Just the one so far.

1:18:57.461 --> 1:19:00.293
Believe me, a gunshot never goes out alone.

1:19:00.363 --> 1:19:01.193
What are you doing?

1:19:01.264 --> 1:19:03.789
Setting up a forward position.

1:19:03.867 --> 1:19:05.390
You play best at the back.

1:19:05.434 --> 1:19:08.403
It's just to get an idea of the topography.

1:19:08.437 --> 1:19:11.098
Facilitate the special forces' entry.

1:19:11.139 --> 1:19:12.902
Put that in your ear.

1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:14.999
You'll know where I'm at.

1:19:22.848 --> 1:19:24.816
This will end in pain.

1:19:26.351 --> 1:19:28.012
To us!

1:19:39.128 --> 1:19:43.086
I can't climb the wall, but there's a post.

1:19:43.431 --> 1:19:46.491
And a branch leading straight in.

1:19:46.534 --> 1:19:49.900
Amazing they didn't saw that off.

1:19:49.937 --> 1:19:51.996
Shit! They did!

1:19:55.041 --> 1:19:58.010
That's topography brought to you by Emilien.

1:19:58.044 --> 1:19:59.908
Let's dance.

1:20:16.925 --> 1:20:18.586
What a couple we make!

1:20:18.627 --> 1:20:22.392
Fire and ice. My guile, your professionalism.

1:20:22.430 --> 1:20:24.898
Striking fear across the land.

1:20:24.932 --> 1:20:29.095
I'd be your Clyde. You'd be my Bonnie.

1:20:29.536 --> 1:20:30.594
Are we dancing or kissing?

1:20:30.637 --> 1:20:32.297
A bit of both?

1:20:32.338 --> 1:20:34.898
Or I'll think you're a mole.

1:20:41.546 --> 1:20:43.979
Did nobody teach you to knock?

1:20:44.048 --> 1:20:47.881
Sorry, boss. Look what fell out of the sky.

1:20:47.917 --> 1:20:49.475
The little Marseille cop.

1:20:49.519 --> 1:20:52.386
Inspector. But you'll get me promotion.

1:20:52.422 --> 1:20:54.889
Hands up! You're under arrest.

1:20:56.425 --> 1:20:58.086
You got balls, coming here with your pop gun,

1:20:58.126 --> 1:21:02.084
to arrest public enemy No. 1 the Flanders Strangler,

1:21:02.129 --> 1:21:04.995
the Benelux Terror.

1:21:06.132 --> 1:21:07.997
The house is surrounded!

1:21:08.034 --> 1:21:08.591
Sure it is.

1:21:08.635 --> 1:21:11.398
Reinforcements! An Armada!

1:21:11.437 --> 1:21:13.268
Helicopters circling overhead!

1:21:13.339 --> 1:21:16.569
Any minute now!

1:21:17.342 --> 1:21:20.868
- Fine, we'll wait for them... - You must be out of your mind!

1:21:20.911 --> 1:21:23.277
And prepare a reception.

1:21:25.915 --> 1:21:28.179
You will pay for your impudence!

1:21:28.217 --> 1:21:29.081
I want him!

1:21:29.118 --> 1:21:31.176
I love tussling with a cop.

1:21:31.219 --> 1:21:32.481
I was on a roll.

1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:35.489
He can be my engagement gift, my pink flamingo.

1:21:35.523 --> 1:21:39.083
No gift could give me greater happiness.

1:21:40.027 --> 1:21:41.891
- Listen, miss! - I'm married!

1:21:41.928 --> 1:21:43.589
I've never hit a woman.

1:21:43.629 --> 1:21:46.257
You should know, I did 8 years ofjudo. Japanese winger.

1:21:50.635 --> 1:21:52.466
Great!

1:21:56.704 --> 1:22:00.070
If you insist, but I fight fair.

1:22:00.107 --> 1:22:02.268
Keep your eyes open, then!

1:22:02.309 --> 1:22:04.173
Don't worry about me!

1:22:04.210 --> 1:22:06.576
I am worried about you!

1:22:08.614 --> 1:22:10.376
Do I know you?

1:22:10.415 --> 1:22:12.076
Think hard!

1:22:13.919 --> 1:22:16.580
I don't know what it's called, but ouch!

1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:19.680
Hurry, guys, before the topographer's topped.

1:22:23.026 --> 1:22:25.153
You like my fiancee?

1:22:25.228 --> 1:22:26.956
Not my type.

1:22:28.797 --> 1:22:31.356
Maybe if I was blonde.

1:22:31.999 --> 1:22:32.658
Petra?

1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:33.962
I knew I knew her.

1:22:34.001 --> 1:22:36.162
About time.

1:22:39.305 --> 1:22:42.273
Here comes Gibert and his big band!

1:22:43.909 --> 1:22:46.571
Maybe if I try the gate...

1:22:46.611 --> 1:22:49.272
Ring the bell while you're at it!

1:22:49.313 --> 1:22:51.873
Surprise is the key ingredient here.

1:22:51.916 --> 1:22:55.749
Our ingenious catapult system helps us hop over the wall.

1:22:58.319 --> 1:23:00.446
The Swedish corkscrew.

1:23:01.122 --> 1:23:03.453
Time to finish him off!

1:23:03.490 --> 1:23:05.253
The death blow!

1:23:05.792 --> 1:23:07.851
I have a knife. Take me hostage.

1:23:07.894 --> 1:23:09.451
Come again?

1:23:09.494 --> 1:23:11.052
Turn me round and take me.

1:23:11.096 --> 1:23:13.257
In front of everybody?

1:23:13.298 --> 1:23:14.958
Take me hostage.

1:23:14.999 --> 1:23:16.557
All right.

1:23:17.802 --> 1:23:19.360
He's got a knife!

1:23:19.403 --> 1:23:20.460
Where'd he get that?

1:23:20.503 --> 1:23:22.164
I searched him personally.

1:23:22.205 --> 1:23:23.763
Nobody move or she gets it!

1:23:23.807 --> 1:23:24.865
Nobody move.

1:23:24.908 --> 1:23:27.171
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

1:23:27.209 --> 1:23:28.767
OK, cop,

1:23:28.811 --> 1:23:31.040
tell me what you want and you'll have it.

1:23:33.014 --> 1:23:36.346
Sure this is a good idea? With no warm-up?

1:23:36.783 --> 1:23:38.944
I am warm. I'm sizzling.

1:23:38.985 --> 1:23:43.751
You're talking to a finalist, Saumur Trampoline Championship, 1971.

1:23:43.789 --> 1:23:45.552
That was long ago!

1:23:45.591 --> 1:23:48.058
It's like riding a bike. You never forget.

1:23:48.093 --> 1:23:49.754
Crank it up!

1:24:02.805 --> 1:24:04.032
Betrayed by technology!

1:24:04.106 --> 1:24:06.040
Check out what's wrong.

1:24:06.108 --> 1:24:07.735
Right away, chief.

1:24:11.078 --> 1:24:12.443
What number are you?

1:24:12.480 --> 1:24:14.037
How do I know!

1:24:14.080 --> 1:24:17.743
I'm last in line.

1:24:18.385 --> 1:24:20.545
The fuse must have blown.

1:24:20.586 --> 1:24:23.248
Trying to lift fatso.

1:24:23.288 --> 1:24:24.846
Got it, chief!

1:24:52.879 --> 1:24:53.846
We have visitors.

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:55.939
What do we do?

1:24:56.783 --> 1:24:58.340
We go to war!

1:25:05.189 --> 1:25:07.054
Wanna play do ya?

1:25:07.091 --> 1:25:09.718
Wanna roast me? So, come and get me!

1:25:19.567 --> 1:25:21.831
Glad I stayed in the cab.

1:25:27.174 --> 1:25:29.734
I'm No. 1 here! Got that?

1:25:29.776 --> 1:25:31.538
Not just in Belgium. The world's public enemy No. 1!

1:25:31.577 --> 1:25:34.239
A few gendarmes don't scare me!

1:25:55.964 --> 1:25:58.022
I'll blow you up a storm. Just watch.

1:25:59.867 --> 1:26:02.926
The gendarme counter-attacks! You're bustir my balls!

1:26:04.370 --> 1:26:05.928
And this gendarme...

1:26:06.773 --> 1:26:09.332
is gonna clean up this town

1:26:09.374 --> 1:26:11.433
double-quick!

1:26:29.758 --> 1:26:31.122
Daniel, help!

1:26:31.159 --> 1:26:33.024
Ain't that a surprise.

1:26:36.263 --> 1:26:38.925
Who's the No. 1 now?

1:26:50.976 --> 1:26:54.308
That's dangerous. Time for some serious weaponry.

1:26:54.979 --> 1:26:56.708
- He's crazy! - What's he doing?

1:26:56.747 --> 1:26:59.010
Look what I found!

1:27:00.149 --> 1:27:02.208
I only ever saw this in photos.

1:27:02.252 --> 1:27:03.115
Switch on.

1:27:03.151 --> 1:27:05.312
He needs locking up!

1:27:05.854 --> 1:27:09.311
I'm gonna waste those scumbags.

1:27:32.543 --> 1:27:34.101
Help!

1:27:57.863 --> 1:28:00.491
It's better in yellow.

1:28:06.837 --> 1:28:08.303
My love!

1:28:08.338 --> 1:28:11.705
To think I didn't recognize you. I nearly hit you.

1:28:11.741 --> 1:28:15.005
Don't worry, I'd have fought back.

1:28:20.048 --> 1:28:22.312
Get a room, will you?

1:28:31.157 --> 1:28:34.092
You're driving me to distraction.

1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:37.185
I know. You're not the only one.

1:28:40.931 --> 1:28:43.695
Take me to your leader.

1:28:43.734 --> 1:28:45.201
Excuse me.

1:28:45.835 --> 1:28:47.496
Hi, nice meet to you.

1:28:48.838 --> 1:28:51.102
- Can I ask your rank? - Commander.

1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:52.106
Is that all?

1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:55.109
You look like General material to me.

1:28:55.143 --> 1:28:58.111
Somebody upstairs doesn't like you.

1:28:58.145 --> 1:28:59.806
Leave it to me.

1:28:59.847 --> 1:29:03.282
I know the top brass.

1:29:03.350 --> 1:29:06.285
I give them a lot of business, so they owe me favor or two.

1:29:06.353 --> 1:29:08.377
Let's talk it over in my car.

1:29:08.454 --> 1:29:10.388
With pleasure.

1:29:10.522 --> 1:29:12.183
Take him away!

1:29:12.224 --> 1:29:15.488
You're making a mistake! You'll pay for this!

1:29:15.526 --> 1:29:18.688
Let go of me!

1:29:26.034 --> 1:29:28.400
You steered us through a minefield.

1:29:28.436 --> 1:29:29.697
Thanks,

1:29:29.737 --> 1:29:32.399
but Emilien did all the work. I just drove.

1:29:32.439 --> 1:29:35.202
Actually, the meter's still ticking over.

1:29:35.241 --> 1:29:38.074
I don't get it. You knew he planned a heist?

1:29:38.144 --> 1:29:42.273
Yes, and legally we can't go near those boxes,

1:29:42.347 --> 1:29:45.282
so we let him do it for us.

1:29:45.317 --> 1:29:47.876
Seeing as he's going down anyway.

1:29:47.918 --> 1:29:49.385
Exactly.

1:29:49.420 --> 1:29:51.387
How did you know he'd escape?

1:29:51.421 --> 1:29:54.879
The odds seemed pretty good.

1:29:54.924 --> 1:29:56.481
Oh, yeah?

1:29:57.226 --> 1:29:59.888
So I helped make the operation a success?

1:29:59.928 --> 1:30:02.191
You were just perfect.

1:30:23.532 --> 1:30:25.795
Any news of Gibert?

1:30:25.834 --> 1:30:29.064
We gave him a bottle of downers and he just laughed.

1:30:29.136 --> 1:30:33.266
C'mon, lads! We'll mash 'em!

1:30:35.308 --> 1:30:36.969
Nice and easy, take them to pieces!

1:30:37.009 --> 1:30:38.874
He's still flying, huh?

1:30:38.911 --> 1:30:41.071
We've tried everything.

1:30:41.112 --> 1:30:44.081
He's down to run a marathon. It won't be enough.

1:30:44.115 --> 1:30:47.982
Footwork! Shoot!

1:30:48.018 --> 1:30:50.282
Where'd they get these no-hopers?

1:30:50.321 --> 1:30:53.187
Look at you! It's The March of the Penguins!

1:30:57.526 --> 1:31:00.154
Shoot!

1:31:02.930 --> 1:31:07.060
This isn't a knitting circle! Give the ball hell!

1:31:07.100 --> 1:31:08.863
Look!

1:31:15.508 --> 1:31:20.774
That's not hard, is it?

1:31:21.613 --> 1:31:24.581
Bring it under control and...

1:31:24.615 --> 1:31:28.483
Round and Round! Now, overhead kick!

1:31:31.521 --> 1:31:34.455
Goal in! Goal In!
