00:05.005 --> 00:06.716
Last week on P-Valley, y'all...

00:06.757 --> 00:10.136
Mercedes' last dance.
Took you long enough.

00:10.177 --> 00:13.264
Well, 25 retirement age
for a stripper nowadays.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.765
Who gonna take over your Sunday night set?

00:14.807 --> 00:17.017
You in a hole that deep
for a refinancing loan?

00:17.059 --> 00:18.936
I thought you liked a little easy money.

00:18.978 --> 00:21.856
I do. I'm just wonderin' why
all these Mexican niggas here.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.775
- What's a girl have to do to work here?
- You can start tomorrow if you want.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.652
Is this one empt...

00:26.694 --> 00:29.196
Slow your roll, high yellow.
I ain't gone yet.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.490
Can't believe I even let you
hide your booty money

00:31.532 --> 00:32.992
in the church building fund.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.243
You sure weren't complainin'

00:34.285 --> 00:35.786
when I put that booty money
in y'all account

00:35.828 --> 00:37.288
so y'all could apply for that loan.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.289
It's Hailey.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.915
That's my name.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.794
Well, I lays motherfuckers out.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.755
That's why they call me Little Murder.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.340
I got somethin' that'll murder you.

01:19.914 --> 01:24.835
Mistress told me master's been
a very, very bad boy.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.592
She caught me.

01:31.634 --> 01:34.136
She caught me with my hand
in the cookie jar.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.473
How that cookie taste?

01:38.641 --> 01:41.435
So good, my hand got lost all up in it.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.354
So you gonna lose a hand
or a foot tonight.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.065
Oh, please.

01:46.816 --> 01:49.860
Master Cedes, I need my hands.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.821
Master Cedes knows no mercy.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.531
I said a hand or a foot.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.907
You don't want me to pick.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.492
Shall I pick?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.247
I finna pick.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.082
Put it where they won't see.

02:10.673 --> 02:11.882
Yeah.

02:13.259 --> 02:14.301
Damn, girl!

02:29.024 --> 02:30.317
Let me give you a better view.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.152
Yeah, yeah.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.487
Come on, girl.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.707
I'ma need you to focus.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.500
Yeah, focus.

04:07.790 --> 04:10.751
Welcome to Fantasy Fridays.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.378
I see bitches dressed as pimps

04:12.419 --> 04:14.004
and these niggas dressed as hos,

04:14.046 --> 04:15.339
but it don't matter

04:15.381 --> 04:19.218
as long as you throw
that green on the floor!

04:30.688 --> 04:32.231
Y'all keep throwin' cash,

04:32.272 --> 04:36.819
they keep throwin' ass!

05:06.640 --> 05:08.851
Uncle Clifford!

05:09.643 --> 05:12.855
Fantasy Friday's lit, as usual.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.983
Well, you know how we do it
down here in Pussy Valley.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.653
We ain't repressed
like them heifers on the hill.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.616
Always a pleasure, Uncle Clifford.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.994
The pleasure's all mine, Corbin.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.247
Come here.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.957
Bye, Corbin.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.213
He bring the whip?

05:38.255 --> 05:39.882
You know he did.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.135
Mo' money, mo' problems.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.889
Yeah, I'd have problems, too, if I was
that light and still couldn't pass.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.893
All that yellow wasted.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.605
Girl, if you don't take your colored
struck ass on somewhere...

05:57.900 --> 06:00.360
Hey, baller...

06:05.657 --> 06:07.201
Now, look, I done already
let you work a week

06:07.242 --> 06:08.619
without gettin' paperwork started,

06:08.660 --> 06:10.996
but I'ma need to see ID now.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.083
I prefer to be paid
under the table like Maite.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.376
Bitch, do I look like
Wesley Snipes to you?

06:16.418 --> 06:20.297
I don't know how she did that shit,
but Maite got them papers straight, okay?

06:20.339 --> 06:24.051
Rule number 54, we don't do tax evasion.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.636
Everybody work up in here
independent contract,

06:25.677 --> 06:27.679
even them ones with felonies.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.015
Since when does a brothel need
paperwork on its whores?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.934
No, no, no, no.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.104
Rule number 67, contrary
to Chucalissa belief,

06:35.145 --> 06:37.147
ain't no hos in this house.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.526
So Mercedes and Keyshawn just twerk
up in the Paradise Room, then, huh?

06:46.115 --> 06:47.908
Only girls been here a Mississippi minute

06:47.950 --> 06:50.327
know what really go on
up in that room right there.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.664
And with no ID,

06:53.705 --> 06:57.251
your ass ain't gon' last here
another second.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.255
- Uncle Clifford, please...
- Do what you gotta do, boo.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.132
But if you wanna twerk it
up in here tomorrow,

07:03.173 --> 07:05.008
I'ma need to see some ID.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.760
Okay, Summer's Eve?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.276
God damn.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.779
Toy, you need to lay off
them suicide wings.

07:29.158 --> 07:30.576
No, Maite,

07:30.617 --> 07:32.744
you need to get
some Money House Blessing air fresheners,

07:32.786 --> 07:36.039
'cause that's the only thing
that can deal with Toy's stank.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.083
- Bitch, whatever.
- Fuck you.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.043
Bitch, hold this shit.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.297
One week later, and this bitch
still changing in the stalls?

07:43.338 --> 07:44.548
Like, what she got to be ashamed about?

07:44.590 --> 07:47.384
Well, I ain't gon' have to worry with it
after a while,

07:47.426 --> 07:49.595
'cause come few more weeks,

07:49.636 --> 07:51.972
and I's gone, bitches!

08:05.027 --> 08:07.029
Let's go make this money!

08:34.223 --> 08:36.058
Hey. Hey! Settle down now.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.268
I'm gonna send y'all asses back
to chewing them checks.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.812
See how your money like that.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.150
Bank these Mexican niggas bringing in
ain't gon' be enough, man.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.902
Big L, just calm.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.953
When your boy Duffy stopping by
to pick up his Oxy?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.496
Next few days, he said.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.165
Interstate from Houston still flooded,
so he gotta take the back way.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.252
Well, you a good one for helping him out.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.129
Maybe you throw a extra stack on it.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.091
Half pay for this here.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.680
What'd I tell you about opening
my motherfucking mail, Big L?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.556
Hell, somebody need to.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.477
It say if we don't pay up in 30 days,
they gonna have our asses kissing asphalt.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.522
No, hey, Big L,
don't you worry about all that.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.649
Shit gonna be handled before they try
to kick us out of here.

09:25.691 --> 09:29.027
'Sides, look, we got some extra skrilla
rollin' in here tomorrow.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.904
The Pynk Annual Soap Down

09:30.946 --> 09:33.991
about to make it rain and sleet
up in this bitch.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.702
Ain't enough cars to wash
in all of Chucalissa

09:36.743 --> 09:38.161
can help us stack all that paper.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.455
All money add up, Big L.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.582
Hell, we done been through worse.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.084
Notice of default now.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.377
Foreclosure next.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.212
This the worstest it done been, Clifford.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.714
Nigga, just count.

09:50.465 --> 09:56.096
I just know a nigga with two charges
ain't got nowhere else to go, so...

09:56.138 --> 09:57.806
please handle that.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.935
For all of us.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.283
Think you- pretty slick.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.452
Jesus. God damn it.

11:00.494 --> 11:03.580
Ain't nobody about to pop
no slugs up in you, man.

11:06.041 --> 11:09.461
Lil nigga? How the fuck you get in my car?

11:09.503 --> 11:11.004
Don't worry about all that.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.593
Look, you lookin' for some stacks,
I ain't got nothing on me.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.100
Nigga, if this the end,
let it be that, then.

11:23.141 --> 11:26.603
I slid you beaucoup bank
'cause you said you would play my shit.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.691
Don't try to split my wig
'cause Cedes ain't wanna bop to that slaw.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.152
You gotta make something
these bitches wanna twerk to.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.321
I thought you had control
over your stable.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.782
On top of that, the skreets say Mercedes
your bottom bitch,

11:38.824 --> 11:40.033
so what that say about you?

11:41.410 --> 11:43.662
That every bitch got a choice
in this game.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.996
Is that right?

11:45.038 --> 11:47.290
I tried to give you a choice,
but you ain't want the D.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.460
Probably couldn't take that shit no way.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.591
Quit flodgin'.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.218
Your shit ain't that big.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.719
My shit big...

12:04.057 --> 12:05.851
But my future bigger.

12:08.061 --> 12:12.315
You got potential,
but you ain't ready yet.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.444
You pumpin' out your first thoughts,
and I need your 27th.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.446
Nigga, ain't nobody got time
to be thinkin' no 27 thoughts.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.865
Well, you better if you want to get
these skreets whisperin'.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.880
They whisper enough.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.783
Hey, Cedes.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.993
Oh, Mane, I ain't even see you.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.043
I heard about your last dance coming up.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.463
Hey, you know I'ma be there to see you.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.216
How the hell you gon' come, Mane?

14:01.258 --> 14:03.301
Don't get hemmed up on 5-0
on account of me.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.095
No, got me a fat boy

14:05.136 --> 14:07.514
babysitting my ankle bracelet
for a squirrel sandwich.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.225
Now, by hook or by crook,

14:10.267 --> 14:12.394
I'm gonna be there to see that finale.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.939
I'll believe it when I see it.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.024
Black & Mild, come on, boy.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.624
Come on.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.894
I know you're declining my calls
'cause it's doing that

14:54.936 --> 14:57.314
"triple click
before it go to voice mail" thing.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.565
Anyhow, where you at?

14:58.607 --> 15:00.984
You were supposed to be here two hours ago
to drop off your tithe.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.777
Don't make me come up...

15:02.819 --> 15:03.862
Yes?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Time to practice your solo, Patrice.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.450
You mean "Sister Woodbine."

15:13.038 --> 15:15.373
Patrice Woodbine.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.293
About to blow the house down.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.712
Well, you know how I do, Pastor Gilfield.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.422
Yep.

15:22.464 --> 15:24.507
Sang so pretty,

15:24.549 --> 15:26.635
sinners come up off they last penny,

15:26.676 --> 15:28.678
come offering times.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.972
Speaking of,

15:31.014 --> 15:32.682
I thought you was gonna get

15:32.724 --> 15:36.936
another one of your daughter's
contributions today.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.396
She just gave her offering.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.398
Bank say they ain't gon' give us that loan

15:40.440 --> 15:44.903
lessen we come up with at least
a 20% down payment, now.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.280
I could do some extra
sick and shut-in visits.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.407
Can you just talk to your daughter?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.034
With a voice like yours,

15:51.076 --> 15:55.372
you don't need to be doing
no offering song.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.916
You need a pulpit.

15:59.042 --> 16:03.880
I think I might just have to try you out
on that pulpit one Sunday service.

16:05.090 --> 16:08.009
That would be nice.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.315
There.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.111
I hope you can see better.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.988
Clearly.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.936
Sorry, ma'am, my computer just froze.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.147
FEMA system know it keep on crashin'.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.316
There it go.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.986
- That name again?
- Lakeisha Savage.

17:09.571 --> 17:12.282
No record of anyone by that name
having been identified yet.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.159
What about Salita Parson?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.871
I'm sorry.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.330
Her body was identified.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.167
She's been officially listed as deceased.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.378
One more.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.303
Montavious Hill.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.890
FEMA doesn't have anyone on record

17:36.931 --> 17:39.434
with that name
having been identified yet either.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.227
That's good, right?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.021
Means there's hope he's still out there.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.814
- Thanks.
- Can I help you with...

19:02.433 --> 19:03.685
Pick some!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.104
Excuse me?

19:07.689 --> 19:11.276
Most folks visiting
always want to take some home.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.070
Instead of taking that picture,
you should go on ahead and pick some.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.115
Make a better souvenir.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.910
I'm good.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.332
Look, I know we're waitin',
but why don't we go ahead and get started?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.750
Just be needin' your John Hancocks.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.461
- You want our what?
- Signature, you douche.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.255
Why didn't he just say that, then?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.094
Wayne, sign here.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.471
Wyatt, sign here.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.140
That it?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.349
That's it.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.393
Fuck.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.519
What?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.939
Corbin just text, say he ain't coming.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.609
Don't tell me he's still
on that leasing bullshit.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.943
Hell if I know.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.236
It don't matter anyhow.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.946
Lawyer said all he needed
was our signatures

19:56.988 --> 19:58.406
to transfer the deed to the casino.

19:58.448 --> 20:02.869
Actually, Promised Land can't start
until we have the signatory of all owners,

20:02.911 --> 20:06.539
and according to the will filed
by the county clerk, well...

20:06.581 --> 20:08.291
The brother from another mother
strikes again.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.293
- Ain't this some shit?
- Now, Wyatt, hold that horse now.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.377
No, Wayne, he got...

20:11.419 --> 20:15.173
he got the nerve to look
a $6 million gift horse in the mouth?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.883
I swear, his brain's just as scrambled...

20:16.925 --> 20:18.718
Hey, if you want...

20:18.760 --> 20:20.094
I can talk to him.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.724
Impress upon him
how advantageous this bid is.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.101
Between me and you, the Kyle family

20:27.143 --> 20:29.812
is the only family getting
this price per acreage.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.775
This'll be a historical sale
for Nonconnah County.

20:33.816 --> 20:37.570
And a historical commission
for the man who seals the deal, huh?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.408
I'm just sayin'.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.037
He might benefit
from a more objective view.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.082
I could answer any lingering questions,
talk him through it.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.166
Somebody better.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.001
'Cause he don't want me to.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.344
Mr. Watkins,
yeah, I think we'll take you up

21:01.386 --> 21:04.389
on that kind offer of yorn.

21:07.225 --> 21:10.228
Well, if he's not in the house,
presumably, where am I to find him?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.771
Tonight?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.773
He'll be right over there,

21:13.815 --> 21:16.526
blowing Daddy's hard-earned money
on pussy and Jameson.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.120
I don't know
how I'ma drop it like it's hot

21:27.161 --> 21:28.788
on this asphalt, Miss Cedes.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.790
You could fry a roly-poly on this sucka.

21:30.832 --> 21:31.833
Yeah.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.377
Like, are we really gon' be practicing
in this parking lot?

21:34.419 --> 21:35.962
Hush it.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.547
Coach Cedes got the sparkling can.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.425
Y'all right,
it's too doggone hot out here,

21:40.466 --> 21:41.634
so let me get to it, then.

21:41.676 --> 21:45.763
I brought y'all out here so I could be
the first one to tell y'all.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.348
This time next week,

21:47.390 --> 21:50.309
y'all gon' be practicing inside
this new building right here,

21:50.351 --> 21:52.937
the new home
of the Chucalissa Challengers.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.442
This gon' be our gym?

21:57.483 --> 21:59.235
Miss Mercedes, like, for real, for real?

21:59.277 --> 22:00.570
Yep, yep.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.488
Now, make sure y'all
get y'all uniform orders in

22:02.530 --> 22:04.449
by the end of the next week,
so we can get...

22:04.490 --> 22:05.658
Shake that booty!

22:05.700 --> 22:08.202

22:08.244 --> 22:10.663
- Come give me that booty!
- Get your ass from back round here!

22:16.294 --> 22:17.295
Get back in line.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.759
Gym couldn't come fast enough.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.057
This your girl

22:29.098 --> 22:31.434
M-I, crooked-letter, crooked-letter, I,

22:31.476 --> 22:32.935

22:32.977 --> 22:36.439
humpback, humpback, I, ay!

22:36.481 --> 22:40.693
Beatin' up the Gram
for the Pynk Annual Soap Down.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.070
We doin' it all.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.279
Detailin',

22:43.321 --> 22:44.906

22:46.032 --> 22:48.493
...pulled-pork sandwiches.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.411
The electric slide.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.621
Okay.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.040
All proceeds go to a bitch pockets.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.083
Holla!

22:56.709 --> 23:00.004
Hey, Trinity, y'all better come over here

23:00.046 --> 23:01.089

23:07.887 --> 23:09.639
That made my filling hurt.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.314
See that?
Don't come for me unless I send for you.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.358
We'll see. We'll see.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.409
What trap guy wants his Escalade detailed?

23:30.451 --> 23:32.912
It don't matter,
long as he dropping 50 bones.

23:40.378 --> 23:42.880
It is on and poppin' out here.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.383
This nigga got some nerve.

23:46.968 --> 23:47.969
Don't do it.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.025
You the new mayor secretary?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.946

24:09.448 --> 24:11.534

- Come on, now.

24:11.576 --> 24:13.327
Let's get these pictures. Throw 'em up.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.579
Throw that shit up.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.253
Now, y'all make sure to hashtag us, now.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.714
Soap down.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.215
Hey. Hey, now.

24:26.257 --> 24:28.259
Come on, Clifford, come over here,
take a real picture.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.094
Now, you can't take a real picture
standing all the way over there.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.762
- Come on, now.
- I ain't vote for you.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.557
- Your customers sure did.
- That's 'cause I wasn't runnin'.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.184
Don't you know?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.727
I'm the mayor of Pussy Valley.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.478
Yeah, well, you may
be the mayor of Pussy Valley,

24:39.520 --> 24:41.606
but you are not the mayor of Chucalissa.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.357
True that.

24:43.399 --> 24:47.069
True that, but your voters
like titties with they tequila.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.529
So why you wanna come and make things hard

24:48.571 --> 24:50.907
on us small-business owners
is just beyond me.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.700
Well, if you want to sell
all that hard liquor,

24:52.742 --> 24:54.452
all you gotta do is get
your girls to cover up.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.164
What kind of titty bar ain't got
no motherfuckin' titties, Tydell Ruffin?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.166
Hey, the kind that's
gonna get itself closed

25:00.208 --> 25:02.251
if it don't follow my law.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.671
Hey, now. Hey, man.

25:05.713 --> 25:09.133
Now, if I want to,
I could call the sheriff

25:09.175 --> 25:11.636
and just have him come down here
and shut this car wash down

25:11.677 --> 25:14.096
on account of that
little new nuisance law,

25:14.138 --> 25:16.641
and you really don't want
to deal with that fine

25:16.682 --> 25:20.686
on top of the noise violation
and the sanitation citation,

25:20.728 --> 25:22.021
and you know that little thing
you got going on...

25:23.064 --> 25:24.023
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:24.065 --> 25:25.691
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.526
Let's not call the law and just
shut the whole thing down then.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.570
Right, yeah, that's all I'm saying.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.365
Besides, you still need
to get your Escalade detailed.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.532
Yeah, we gon' do that.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.825
All right.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.287
Mercedes, Autumn.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.500
I want this Escalade so clean,
I'd fuck it.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.296
Girl, come on.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.556

26:02.895 --> 26:03.813

26:04.563 --> 26:05.856

27:04.665 --> 27:05.875
- What's wrong?
- I couldn't get out.

27:05.916 --> 27:06.834
- It's okay.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.463
Hey. Catch your breath.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.256
Somebody get this girl
some water to drink.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.091
I don't need any fucking water!

27:14.133 --> 27:16.052
Mercedes locked me inside!

27:16.093 --> 27:17.762
Bitch, no, I ain't. I ain't did nothing.

27:17.803 --> 27:18.929
Yes, you did!

27:18.971 --> 27:20.014
You locked the door!

27:23.225 --> 27:25.811
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- The door was on child lock.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.192
Clifford.

27:32.193 --> 27:34.487
That shit best be free. Hear me?

27:35.613 --> 27:37.448
Mercedes, take this child
on home for the night.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.617
- I'm all right.
- No.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.244
Cedes'll take you home.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.662
She'll take you home.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.123
Take you home. Come on.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.666
Come on.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.643
You want me to come up?

28:13.818 --> 28:15.111
I said I was fine.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.488
I'm just trying to extend
some Southern hospitality.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.199
Gotta walk a bitch
all the way to her door.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.659
I'm fine.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.453
Bye.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.957
You ain't gon' offer a bitch
a glass of red drink or something?

28:27.998 --> 28:29.250
I don't do Kool-Aid.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.046
I guess you don't do curtains neither.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.528
This bitch stay perpetrating it

30:20.569 --> 30:23.739
No. Bitch bad news like newspapers

30:23.781 --> 30:25.157
She better get her some Venetians.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.288

30:33.040 --> 30:34.500
My lid is my lady Lalidia.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.293

And I'm coming back for my damn lids.

30:47.888 --> 30:48.722
You all right?

30:48.764 --> 30:50.516
Nigga got the nerve to quit on me
mid-shift 'cause I ain't give

30:50.558 --> 30:51.475
his monkey ass a raise.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.519

- Don't worry about him.

30:53.561 --> 30:56.272
'Cause the trinity gonna take care
of everybody hunger tonight.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.984
And what about the next night

31:00.901 --> 31:02.695
You over here. You jumping ship, Cap'n.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.157

31:07.199 --> 31:08.200
It's just...

31:09.076 --> 31:10.703
Hey. Rule 24.5.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.288
No crying at The Pynk.

31:40.274 --> 31:43.193
All right, bitches, let's go, let's go.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.236
Come on, Cedes.

31:53.454 --> 31:54.955
Why you so damn heavy-handed?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.123
That's my grandmama recipe.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.374
Is that why she dead?

31:57.416 --> 31:58.417
If you paid the damn cook,

31:58.459 --> 32:00.044
you wouldn't have to worry
about how I fry my chicken, man.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.088
Hey, yo, that baby shower table is

32:03.130 --> 32:04.632

32:06.675 --> 32:08.552
Hey, yo, Cliff, come listen to this.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.262

32:48.759 --> 32:49.885
Nigga, you is breaking my heart.

32:49.927 --> 32:52.262
You need to learn how to take criticism

32:52.304 --> 32:54.348
- Like you?

Who been saying that?

33:02.356 --> 33:03.816
You ain't got no hookah.

33:03.857 --> 33:04.942
There's no money gun.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.652
Your motherfuckin' wings

33:06.694 --> 33:09.154
My nigga say one of your girls farted

33:09.697 --> 33:10.698

34:12.217 --> 34:15.345

for the sale of y'all's land.

34:16.764 --> 34:18.474
You want a lap dance next?

34:21.810 --> 34:22.686
No.

34:22.728 --> 34:23.937
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.356
What's a little business without pleasure?

34:26.398 --> 34:27.608
Business.

34:28.609 --> 34:29.902
Look at Mr. Morehouse.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.403
Gettin' all hankty on me.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.408
Hey, can you excuse us
for a minute, sugar?

34:40.662 --> 34:42.956
It's important that you
understand all the particulars.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.583
Particulars or not, I ain't signing.

34:45.125 --> 34:49.213
Now, you show me a deal to lease our land,
well, that'll get my attention.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.635
Gin and tonic.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.637
Pop quiz, shark.

34:57.805 --> 35:00.933
Which fish out here worth it
in these rough waters tonight?

35:05.521 --> 35:07.356
Armani suit sittin' with the regular.

35:07.397 --> 35:09.191
Hey, that a girl.

35:14.071 --> 35:15.864
Give this one some water.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.407
To drink.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.329
I can't believe I do this shit sober.

35:22.371 --> 35:24.873
Yo, let me get a hit of that Aquafina.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.126
I need to go pump.
My titties about to explode.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.212
When is you getting your titties back?

35:30.254 --> 35:32.130
Well, I kind of, like,
like breast-feeding.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.174
Keeps 'em out of Derrick's mouth, so, hey.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.634
Why you up here nursing these drinks?

35:35.676 --> 35:37.553
Y'all better go chase
them stacks over there.

35:37.594 --> 35:40.097
See, LaTiffany, that's
why you ain't no stripper.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.057
You always be ridin' the wrong lap.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.518
That geeky-ass nigga
ain't spending no paper.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.354
Mercedes, like, how you
be knowin' this stuff?

35:47.396 --> 35:50.065
One man in the club,
looking to spend money.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.733
Two men in the club,

35:51.775 --> 35:53.193
lookin' to make money.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.904
Let the men focus on they business.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.261
Do you know how much we could get
leasing versus selling?

36:19.303 --> 36:21.263
But y'all promised us the land.

36:21.305 --> 36:22.514
I ain't promise nothing.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.725
Hey, Andre.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.357
You want a dance?

36:32.900 --> 36:34.067
Well, shit.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.944
I thought you said
you ain't been here before.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.323
- I haven't.
- Well, how she know your name, then?

36:39.364 --> 36:41.533
Well, that'll be our little secret.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.952
Hey, baby.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.829
What your name is?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.497
Mercedes, you late to the party.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.875
This one here already know
our friend name.

36:49.917 --> 36:51.585
Is that right?

36:51.627 --> 36:53.295
Well, you look like a Andre.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.546
Did you tell her my...

36:54.588 --> 36:58.383
No, I'm just clairvoyant up in this bitch.

36:58.425 --> 37:02.304
If I know your name, best believe I know
what you gonna like.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.310
Follow me to VIP,
and we can get it poppin', boo.

37:08.352 --> 37:09.311
Bottles too.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.939
What you sippin' on tonight?

37:11.980 --> 37:13.523
Brown liquor?

37:13.565 --> 37:14.775
Or white?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.706
I'll try the white liquor tonight.

37:34.628 --> 37:37.839
Some niggas can't handle them
a Melanin Monroe.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.283
Look like rookie know how
to draw blood from a turnip.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.053
Something in these wings.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.723
Everything all slow-motion, like.

38:27.764 --> 38:30.559
All the asses just move
in slow-mo up in here.

38:34.604 --> 38:37.024
I saw how you looked at me
when you first sit down.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.609
You weren't what I was expecting.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.321
Wayne and Wyatt,
they're sons of the missus.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.490
I'm the son of the maid,

38:45.532 --> 38:48.368
but this bastard
about to make a few million.

38:49.494 --> 38:52.706
That's more than most folks
in Chucalissa make in two lifetimes.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.249
Yeah, true that.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.752
But I ain't interested
in making a little one-off,

38:56.793 --> 38:58.253
one million,

38:58.295 --> 39:00.255
'cause that's what it be after taxes.

39:00.297 --> 39:02.841
I'm interested in making 10 million,

39:02.883 --> 39:05.886
and if we actually lease
our land to the casino,

39:05.927 --> 39:08.221
that's what we could make
over the long haul.

39:08.263 --> 39:11.266
I'm just here to facilitate a sale,
not negotiate a lease.

39:11.308 --> 39:15.562
Man, I know them casino folks
might not be too happy with Corbin Kyle

39:15.604 --> 39:17.314
holding up the gravy train.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.610
But what if I made leasing
worth your while, Andre?

39:23.195 --> 39:24.362
What you talking 'bout?

39:25.489 --> 39:27.783
You ever knew you deserve more

39:27.824 --> 39:30.660
than what the world
is willing to give you, Andre?

39:31.495 --> 39:32.913
I'm familiar with the feeling.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.708
Well, all my life...

39:38.335 --> 39:40.504
...they never claimed me as a Kyle.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.925
I had the name, but I never
got the benefits.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.928
That is, until our daddy died.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.809
They say I was lucky to get on this ship.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.936
But, hell, they always say that.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.897
They about right, though.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.235
But me and you both know they owe us.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.445
At least I know they owe me.

40:06.363 --> 40:10.450
And I'm gonna keep this pipeline flowing
for me and for a brother.

40:10.492 --> 40:12.244
We're not brothers.

40:12.285 --> 40:15.330
- Hey, man, we some kinfolk.
- All skinfolk ain't kinfolk.

40:16.164 --> 40:20.710
Well, blood ain't thicker than water
round these here parts,

40:20.752 --> 40:25.715
but I can make it rain for a friend.

40:28.468 --> 40:33.348
You introduce me to the right folk,
you get me that lease for the Kyle farms,

40:33.390 --> 40:36.143
well, let's just say

40:36.184 --> 40:38.270
I'd be very grateful.

40:41.773 --> 40:42.899
I'm not for sale.

40:43.984 --> 40:45.527
Man, that ain't a bribe.

40:45.569 --> 40:48.280
That's reparations.
White folks call it a kickback.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.823
- All right, man.
- Hey.

40:52.868 --> 40:55.078
Mayor Ruffin's done more for less.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.210
Hey, think on it.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.797
Hey, new girl.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.384
You a regular lap-dancing sassy.

41:10.594 --> 41:12.220
What's your name?

41:12.262 --> 41:13.805
Autumn.

41:13.847 --> 41:14.848
Autumn Night.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.224
Autumn Night.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.436
You know what to do
up in the champagne room?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.438
'Cause I'm gonna need you
to take my partner on up in there.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.356
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.567
Man, ain't nothin' necessary

41:25.609 --> 41:26.693
till it is.

41:32.574 --> 41:35.452
You take good care of him
for me, now, will you?

41:37.495 --> 41:38.830
Ride's on me.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.323
I followed every rule you done told me.

42:13.365 --> 42:15.075
Never broke one.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.827
Live by the first one.

42:20.956 --> 42:22.666
Let that stage be your stepping stone...

42:22.707 --> 42:24.292
Not your tombstone.

42:25.669 --> 42:26.878
And number two.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.340
Always know where
the exit's at up in this bitch,

42:30.382 --> 42:33.301
'cause you never know when you
got to turn a window to a door.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.099
So when you gon' tell 'em?

42:40.684 --> 42:41.851
That you in trouble?

42:41.893 --> 42:44.271
Bitch, take your third eye on somewhere.

42:45.313 --> 42:46.398
I'ma be all right.

42:54.698 --> 42:55.907
How much you need?

42:57.117 --> 42:59.119
I don't need nothing from you.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.538
I need you to go on
and go about your business.

43:03.456 --> 43:04.541
Bitch...

43:05.709 --> 43:07.585
...how much you need?

43:21.850 --> 43:23.226
You got 55 stacks?

43:34.070 --> 43:36.573
How you gon' get yourself
out of this one, Uncle Clifford?

43:40.952 --> 43:43.246
By learning to follow my own damn rules.

44:32.921 --> 44:33.963
Sit down.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.133
No. On the couch.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.515
No, no, no. Over there.

44:47.977 --> 44:51.106
I can't touch you when I'm so far away.

44:51.147 --> 44:52.816
I don't need to be touched right now.

44:54.275 --> 44:55.777
Wow.

44:55.819 --> 44:58.655
Too good for a lap dance
and too good for a kickback.

44:58.696 --> 44:59.823
You heard that, huh?

44:59.864 --> 45:01.449
Couldn't help but overhear.

45:02.242 --> 45:03.743
He's chatty, that one.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.040
Well, I'm certainly
not too good for a lap dance.

45:09.958 --> 45:13.086
A kickback, that's another story.

45:13.128 --> 45:15.880
Well, I'm glad to know you got
such low standards for your lap

45:15.922 --> 45:18.007
and not your bank account.

45:22.345 --> 45:23.638
How have you been, Hailey?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.892
I'm beginning to regret I told you that.

45:30.603 --> 45:33.064
Well, let's start over,
pretend we never met.

45:56.087 --> 45:57.130
Did it hurt?

46:01.843 --> 46:03.470
No.

46:03.511 --> 46:05.221
I didn't feel a thing.

46:06.222 --> 46:07.515
Mine hurt.

46:21.321 --> 46:22.739
Stings sometimes.

46:23.698 --> 46:24.908
Even still today.

46:26.576 --> 46:27.994
What happened?

46:28.036 --> 46:30.121
I was born with my heart outside my chest.

46:30.914 --> 46:32.040
Shut the front door.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.917
No, true story.

46:41.633 --> 46:43.551
I wanna know what that feels like.

46:46.137 --> 46:48.515
Have your heart beatin'
outside your chest like that.

46:51.643 --> 46:54.354
No different from having
a child, I reckon.

46:58.191 --> 47:00.026
Time's up, Andre.

47:03.363 --> 47:06.241
I know it isn't any of my business,

47:06.282 --> 47:10.828
but if you do end up taking that cut,
make sure you protect yourself.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.372
Protect myself?

47:14.415 --> 47:16.960
You can run your money
through a shell company.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.588
That way, your identity's protected.

47:22.298 --> 47:24.259
Incorporate in Delaware...

47:26.219 --> 47:29.597
They got the best double shell protections
in the country.

47:30.598 --> 47:31.975
Just so you know.

47:37.814 --> 47:39.190
Thanks for the advice.

47:43.486 --> 47:44.404
Hey.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.616
If you ever need anything...

48:19.522 --> 48:20.815
And don't forget.

48:20.857 --> 48:23.151
VIP got raised to 15% cut.

48:23.192 --> 48:24.527
Don't try to run me, heifers.

48:26.904 --> 48:32.118
I bet y'all gon' miss this A1 booty
bringin' in all this bank, though!

48:35.705 --> 48:36.706
All this...

48:37.874 --> 48:38.875
Oh, and...

48:40.627 --> 48:41.919
150 off of this.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.799
So you mean to tell me
this geeky-ass nigga gave you a whole G.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.594
I guess he wasn't just
interested in business,

48:49.636 --> 48:50.845
per your observation.

48:50.887 --> 48:53.973
Well, the type of pleasure
you slangin' out bad for our business.

48:54.015 --> 48:56.225
Givin' these niggas a taste
ruins the fantasy.

48:56.267 --> 48:57.435
You're one to talk.

48:57.477 --> 48:59.103
Bitch, I ain't never
had to lower my morals

48:59.145 --> 49:00.688
never one time for none of these niggas.

49:00.730 --> 49:02.565
Hey, you better cool
all that nastiness down now.

49:02.607 --> 49:04.275
- Come on, now. Come on.
- Trick.

49:04.317 --> 49:06.027
Hey. Hooch on.

49:06.069 --> 49:07.779
Go on, catch y'all share rides.

49:08.488 --> 49:10.907
You just be tryin' to make
these bitches feel bad.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.367
My money on Mercedes.

49:12.408 --> 49:13.826
You ain't got no goddamn money.

49:13.868 --> 49:15.495
Bring your ass on. Come on.

49:16.704 --> 49:19.624
Next time cheat me.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.626
Don't do all that
in front of these heifers.

49:21.668 --> 49:23.044
Sorry.

49:23.086 --> 49:24.629
I won't do it again.

49:26.673 --> 49:27.965
Don't you owe me somethin'?

49:39.143 --> 49:41.437
You don't look like no Lakeisha Savage.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.690
- Well, that's my name.
- Okay, Scorpio.

49:43.731 --> 49:46.234
Your birthday right around the corner.
What kind of cake you like?

49:47.402 --> 49:49.654
- Chocolate.
- Heifer.

49:49.696 --> 49:52.073
- You's a liar.
- I do like chocolate.

49:52.115 --> 49:54.283
But ain't no Scorpios born in May.

49:55.243 --> 49:56.494
This ain't you.

49:56.536 --> 49:57.912
You lyin' 'bout this.

49:57.954 --> 49:59.414
You're tryin' to lie about
how you got that money, too.

49:59.455 --> 50:00.998
All I did was talk.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.667
For $1,000?

50:02.709 --> 50:04.836
That regular was tryin'
to bribe this lawyer

50:04.877 --> 50:07.714
for a better deal
for that casino that's coming.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.507
The Andre dude got all offended,

50:09.549 --> 50:11.843
turned the money down, passed it on to me.

50:11.884 --> 50:13.219
Just a lucky night, I guess.

50:14.595 --> 50:15.763
Casino.

50:18.808 --> 50:20.518
There's a casino coming to Chucalissa?

50:20.560 --> 50:22.061
You don't know.

50:22.103 --> 50:25.231
I know, I just ain't know
that it was happening right now

50:25.273 --> 50:27.734
- and Corbin was...
- Is.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.485
- Selling...
- Leasin'?

50:29.527 --> 50:31.070
Heifer, just tell me what you know.

50:31.112 --> 50:32.822
No, it ain't any of your business
like it ain't any of mine.

50:32.864 --> 50:34.615
Oh, slow your roll, 24 Savage.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.493
Now, that boy he was sitting with,
he ain't take that bribe.

50:37.535 --> 50:38.369
Why?

50:39.996 --> 50:41.164
Ask him yourself.

50:43.124 --> 50:45.001
Andre Watkins, Esquire.

50:49.505 --> 50:51.174
I don't need to talk to him...

50:53.134 --> 50:55.511
...not when I got somebody else
it seem he like talking to.

50:57.221 --> 50:59.932
Now, I'ma need you to use them lips.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.435
And I'll leave it up to you to decide
which set you gon' use.

51:02.477 --> 51:03.978
You are not my pimp.

51:04.020 --> 51:07.231
But I am your employer
with a fake-ass ID in my hand.

51:07.273 --> 51:08.983
Now, unless you don't want me
to call the sheriff

51:09.025 --> 51:10.985
and let him know about the little fraud
game you probably running,

51:11.027 --> 51:12.945
I suggest you do as I say.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.201
You right. You did get lucky tonight.

51:19.202 --> 51:22.497
'Cause you surely ain't gon' stack a G
in one night slangin' burgers

51:22.538 --> 51:24.916
or manning the layaway over at Marshall's.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.044
And this little DIY haircut
you done gave yourself

51:28.085 --> 51:30.880
is proof enough you need this job.

51:30.922 --> 51:32.799
You don't know what the fuck I need.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.676
I know you need to give me
some motherfuckin' answers.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.846
Now, I'ma hold on to this.

51:42.058 --> 51:44.060
And you bring me back some tea.

51:45.520 --> 51:49.857
Uncle Clifford's ears
is awful, awful thirsty.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.756
Now, why you ain't reply to my texts?

52:13.798 --> 52:17.260
You were supposed to meet me at the church
to pass off the tithes.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.679
I've been calling you all day.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.444
I'ma need those 20 stacks I let y'all hold
come end of the week.

52:35.486 --> 52:38.322
- What you mean by that?
- I ain't stutter.

52:38.364 --> 52:40.032
You said you wanted
to let me stash it there

52:40.074 --> 52:41.826
until the bank approved y'all little loan.

52:41.868 --> 52:43.286
I did that.

52:45.538 --> 52:48.040
I upheld my part of the bargain.

52:48.082 --> 52:49.375
Did they approve it?

52:49.417 --> 52:50.626
We still waitin' on it.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.879
Well, I can only wait
till next week, so...

52:52.920 --> 52:57.717
So you finally want
your little coins back, huh?

52:59.802 --> 53:00.720
Yeah.

53:01.554 --> 53:03.681
You gon' get my change back.

53:03.723 --> 53:07.310
All 20 stacks.

53:48.643 --> 53:51.270
When you gonna put them shelves up, Andre?

53:51.312 --> 53:53.814
Yeah, I'ma put the shelves up
when I get back...

53:56.692 --> 53:58.527
Babe, hold on a second.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.403
Okay.

53:59.445 --> 54:00.446
Hello?

54:00.488 --> 54:02.114
May I speak to Mr. Andre Watkins?

54:02.156 --> 54:03.115
This is he.

54:03.157 --> 54:04.158
Who is this?

54:06.827 --> 54:08.162
Hailey.

54:09.956 --> 54:11.040
Hold on.

54:15.086 --> 54:17.213
Babe, I have to call you back.

54:17.254 --> 54:18.631
I've been playing phone tag

54:18.673 --> 54:20.967
with Bill down in Bora Bora
for a minute now,

54:21.008 --> 54:22.510
and he finally done caught up
with me, so...

54:22.551 --> 54:24.512
- Oh, he did?
- Yeah.

54:24.553 --> 54:26.722
- He keeping his promise?
- Yeah.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.766
- Y'all almost done, right?
- Yep.

54:28.808 --> 54:31.769
Okay. Well, let me get off this phone
so you can take care of this business.

54:31.811 --> 54:33.020
Good night, babe.

54:33.813 --> 54:34.814
Bye, babe.

54:38.567 --> 54:42.780
Well, this is unexpected.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.200
You don't mind me calling you
this late, do you?

54:46.242 --> 54:47.785
I don't sleep, so...

54:47.827 --> 54:49.453
Neither do I.

54:50.621 --> 54:51.831
What, you don't like to dream?

54:52.623 --> 54:54.375
I don't like to have nightmares.

54:56.669 --> 54:58.045
I hear that.

54:59.922 --> 55:02.550
Did that really happen
to you when you were a kid?

55:02.591 --> 55:04.218
Somethin' must've been in them wings.

55:04.260 --> 55:08.597
I'm a little ashamed I said that,
but, yeah.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.765
That's me.

55:18.399 --> 55:19.650
You all right?

55:26.282 --> 55:27.700
Where your hands, Andre?

55:33.122 --> 55:34.206
Where are yours?

55:35.499 --> 55:36.876
I think you know where.

55:38.085 --> 55:39.879
Hey, yo, let me hit you on FaceTime.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.672
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

55:43.257 --> 55:45.384
I want you to use your imagination.

55:45.426 --> 55:46.427
I want to see you.

55:46.469 --> 55:50.306
Oh, but I bet you got a big imagination.

55:53.684 --> 55:56.687
And I want you to use it on me.

56:05.571 --> 56:06.822
Yo, don't bust yet.

56:09.742 --> 56:12.870
I'm waiting for you to get on up inside.

56:12.912 --> 56:13.954
Are you there yet?

56:14.705 --> 56:15.623
Yeah.

56:15.664 --> 56:18.334
Oh, I'ma need you to go slow, Andre.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.338
Is that how you like it?

56:22.379 --> 56:25.257
That's how most girls like it
when they want it to last all night.

56:25.299 --> 56:26.383
I ain't got all night.

56:31.722 --> 56:33.099
You're gonna make me cum.

56:33.140 --> 56:34.517
Stop.

56:37.269 --> 56:39.730
I'ma need you to go slower than that.

57:04.463 --> 57:06.090
How does it feel?

57:07.383 --> 57:08.300
Good.

57:12.012 --> 57:13.639
How do I taste?

57:19.770 --> 57:20.771
Yes.

57:21.605 --> 57:24.066
I'ma need you to go faster now, Andre.

57:29.822 --> 57:30.990
Almost there.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.908
Almost.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.201
Almost there.

57:40.541 --> 57:42.001
Fuck, yeah.

57:43.627 --> 57:44.795
Hailey.

58:29.632 --> 58:30.841
My, my.

58:32.051 --> 58:33.594
Oh, boy.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.478
This little nigga?

58:45.272 --> 58:46.941
I ain't that old.
