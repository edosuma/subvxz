WEBVTT

00:17.643 --> 00:19.258
SARAH: 'Twas the night
before Christmas,

00:19.436 --> 00:22.553
and all through the house,
that is, all through me,

00:23.398 --> 00:25.104
not a creature
was stirring,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.436
except Sheriff Carter
and Dr. Blake.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.567
Wow!

00:29.738 --> 00:32.104
You think you went
a little overboard
decking the halls here?

00:32.282 --> 00:34.193
I think that SARAH
looks beautiful.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.950
SARAH: Thank you, Dr. Blake.
| feel so festive.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.112
Hey, can you hand me
that talking polar bear
over there?

00:40.290 --> 00:41.871
Yeah.
Jenna is dying
for it.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.876
Wow, uh, and
then you're almost
done, right?

00:46.088 --> 00:47.669
I'm in the home stretch.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.458
Let's see,
if I've stuffed
the stockings,

00:49.633 --> 00:52.545
hung the mistletoe,
roasted the chestnuts...

00:54.054 --> 00:56.716
And, oh, man, | forgot
the silicon air battery.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.006
Oh, no!
Not the silicon air...

00:59.184 --> 01:01.049
What are we going
to do without
a silicon air battery?

01:01.228 --> 01:03.264
It's the power source
for one of Jenna's gifts.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.474
You're going
to get it now?

01:05.649 --> 01:06.729
Trust me,
once she opens it,

01:06.900 --> 01:08.185
she's going to want
to use it right away.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.395
Ally...

01:09.570 --> 01:11.561
Why don't you
just sit down, huh?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.524
Relax, enjoy the holidays.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.111
Have you met me before?
This is howl enjoy it.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.570
Honey, this is
the one time a year

01:17.744 --> 01:18.733
we can make
a little magic.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.779
And don't think
I haven't seen you
and Henry conspiring.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.663
l have no idea
what you're talking about.
(LAUGHING)

01:23.834 --> 01:24.914
None at all.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.916
ZOE: See?
It's just our folks.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.912
Jenna thought
she heard Santa Claus.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.172
What are you
doing awake?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.595
Okay, listen,
those gifts are from us,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.343
but if you want Santa
to bring his presents,

01:37.514 --> 01:39.630
you're going to have
to go to sleep.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.923
Yeah, good luck
with that.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.268
All right, how about
we read one more story?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.598
The sooner
you go to bed,

01:45.772 --> 01:47.057
the sooner
you can wake up,

01:47.232 --> 01:49.609
and then we can all open
our presents together.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.607
Say, "Yes, Mommy."
Yes, Mommy.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
That's my girl.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.107
All right, baby,
I will be back in a bit.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.522
CARTER: All right, me, too.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.190
I'm going to go
check on Andy.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.233
Not even a robot
should be alone
on Christmas Eve.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.494
ALLISON:
All right, one story,
and right to bed.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.495
I'll try.
(WHOOSHING)

02:05.125 --> 02:07.958
SARAH: They all
wanted to make
the perfect Christmas,

02:09.963 --> 02:11.624
but this is Eureka.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.132
Hi, guys.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.934
Managed to, uh,
sneak away.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.435
We still on schedule?

02:27.606 --> 02:29.938
Yes, sirree!
All systems go for
Operation Ho, Ho, Ho.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.895
Ha! That's our codename
for the big Christmas
morning surprise.

02:33.070 --> 02:33.809
Ingenious.
Yeah!

02:33.987 --> 02:35.067
And I made all
the kids' favorites.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.149
Snicker doodles,
fudge, fruitcake.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.234
Yeah, we're almost
set up here.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.659
You want a...
You want a sneak peek?
Yeah. Hit me.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.484
Here we go.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.917
That's a peek,
all right.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.083
Don't worry,
a few minor adjustments,

02:57.260 --> 02:58.636
and your winter wonderland
will be up

02:58.804 --> 03:00.385
and running again
in no time.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.681
I hope so.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.054
It's my only wish
this Christmas.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.260
(GASPING)
I have one, too.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.846
And I have been
such a good boy.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.228
You don't actually
beHevein”.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.185
What?
Of course you do.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.565
| just hope that
Henry and Fargo

03:13.735 --> 03:15.066
have the snowmaking
machine ready.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.522
You mean
the super-photon generator?

03:16.697 --> 03:17.857
Sure. Yeah.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.487
Just can't wait
to see the kids' faces
when they wake up

03:19.658 --> 03:21.364
and the whole town
is covered in snow.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.150
It's going to
be awesome.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.864
ZOE: "He sprang
to his sleigh,

03:25.038 --> 03:26.414
"to his team
gave a whistle,

03:26.581 --> 03:29.197
"and away they all flew,
like the down of a thistle.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.867
"But I heard him exclaim
ere he drove out of sight,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.878
"'Happy Christmas to all
and to all a good night.'"

03:35.048 --> 03:36.037
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:36.216 --> 03:37.456
JENNA: Let's play!

03:40.470 --> 03:41.926
Jenna, we have
to go to bed.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.507
There's no way
she's going to go.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.513
Well, maybe
you could help?

03:45.684 --> 03:46.548
I don't know.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.092
Let her open a present.
You want to open a present?

03:48.562 --> 03:51.178
Okay, yeah, like your mom
would be okay with that.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.812
That's not how
your family
does Christmas.

03:52.983 --> 03:53.733
Yeah, but Jack says

03:53.900 --> 03:55.401
you guys always
open one present
on Christmas Eve.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.730
And aren't we a part
of your family now?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.311
Wow. You're good.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.478
Okay, Jenna,
one present,

04:00.657 --> 04:02.613
then we have to
go to sleep, okay?

04:03.034 --> 04:04.319
Come on. Come sit.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.242
Oh! What is it?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.124
Wow!

04:13.295 --> 04:14.410
It's a Holotown.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.119
ZOE: What's it do?

04:16.715 --> 04:19.707
"Imagine a journey
with turns and twists.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.126
"Your greatest adventure
within exists."

04:22.304 --> 04:25.011
"You make the choices,
decide what, where,
and when.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.342
"Create your
own Holotown.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.097
"Ready? Begin."

04:28.769 --> 04:30.225
You want to play?
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.931
Yes? Okay,
let's do it.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.220
Oh, I don't
think we can.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.353
There's no battery.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.479
Oh, well,
beddy-bye time.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.935
I bet I can find
something to start it up.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.145
Be right back.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.150
Thanks, Kevin.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.482
Yay, Kevin.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.360
Oh, got it.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.910
JO: Allison?
(GASPING) Oh.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.454
Sorry!
You startled me.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.453
I wasn't expecting
anyone to be here.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.706
Oh, well,
I need this for one
of Jenna's presents.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.412
What are you
still doing here?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.793
I let my team
have the night off.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.955
You know, you can
activate automatic
security protocols.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.000
You don't have to work
on Christmas Eve either.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.465
Why don't you come over?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.971
Oh, uh, thanks.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.302
But I'm good.
Hmm.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.514
I like it like this.
It's the only time
it's calm at G.D.

05:14.981 --> 05:15.845
(PAGER BEEPING)

05:18.777 --> 05:19.857
When will I learn?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.438
System overload.
Shut it down.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.822
I'm trying.
I've lost contact.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.607
There's some sort
of interference.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.026
JO: I should have known.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.489
What is going on?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.870
Uh, nothing.
Nothing.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.156
Really? Because it looks like
our super-photon generator

05:34.334 --> 05:35.323
has gone berserk.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.367
Well, it'sjust
a glitch, which we
can't seem to identify.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.127
Now, Fargo,
you have inspected
the generator site

05:39.297 --> 05:40.207
and confirmed
the connection?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.247
I made a list.
I checked it twice.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.086
Why are you two messing
with this stuff now?

05:45.762 --> 05:47.298
It's classified.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.221
But, uh,
no need to panic.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.508
I can restore
contact from here.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.596
(GENERATOR BEEPING)

05:56.606 --> 05:57.891
You were saying?
Hmm.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.482
(ACCELERATING)

06:12.205 --> 06:15.072
CARTER: Hey, guys?
What is that?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.163
Must be
the super-photon
generator.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.326
Huh.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.370
Maybe they
set it off early.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.041
That just means
more snow, right?

06:27.304 --> 06:30.171
Uh, that doesn't
look like snow.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.966
Definitely not snow!

06:34.144 --> 06:35.133
(ALL SCREAMING)

06:47.073 --> 06:48.483
(PANTING)

06:50.201 --> 06:52.066
Definitely not snow!

07:25.487 --> 07:26.397
Do you see
what I see?

07:26.571 --> 07:28.072
Either that
or I'm dreaming.
Pinch me, Sheriff.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.445
Take my word for it,
you're awake.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.481
Andy, why are we cartoons?

07:32.035 --> 07:33.445
I believe we only
appear to be.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.951
The explosion of
super-photons

07:35.121 --> 07:37.498
must have changed
the way our eyes
are translating light.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.622
It may be altering
our perception.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.579
You ask for
a simple white
Christmas, right?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.163
A little bit of snow.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.327
Allison!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.296
Small issue.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.297
We noticed.
We're working on it.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.004
Fargo and Henry
lost communication

07:50.178 --> 07:51.634
with the super-photon
generator.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.674
Did they tell you
what they were doing?

07:53.848 --> 07:56.225
It's classified, apparently.
Good.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.009
Um, hey, how long is
this misperception thing
going to last?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.143
The super-photons
haven't dissipated,

08:01.314 --> 08:03.225
which means
the generator
is still leaking.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.140
Jack, you'll have to
stop the flow manually.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.433
Manually?

08:06.611 --> 08:07.896
I'll meet you
at the site.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.227
You hear that?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.816
Yeah. So it's temporary.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.481
We patch the leak,
back to normal.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.614
Better be.

08:14.035 --> 08:14.820
What about the kids?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.781
I tried them.
Can't get through.
Probably asleep.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.664
Will SARAH's shielding
protect them?

08:18.873 --> 08:20.534
Yes. But we have
to fix this by morning,

08:20.709 --> 08:23.746
or there goes
our perfect Christmas.
I'm on it.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.585
(SIGHS)

08:26.756 --> 08:28.417
I've been planning
this surprise for weeks.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.626
Why is there
always a hitch?

08:29.801 --> 08:32.008
Don't worry, boss.
There's plenty of time
to fix this.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.509
It's only midnight.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.140
Not anymore.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.476
Oh.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.935
ZOE: Yeah, that's how
you make it morning.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.600
You push the sun
for daytime,

08:48.778 --> 08:50.484
and then you push
the moon for night.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.067
Sweet. Let me try.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.700
Kevin, it's Jenna's.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.154
But it only works
because of
my hover board battery.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.034
Yeah, I don't think
a lithium-air battery

09:02.208 --> 09:03.709
is compatible
with this system.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.788
Whatever. All right,
at least we have power.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.247
Here, Jenna, you try.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.789
Huh.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.553
Another perception
issue?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.760
Perhaps a shared delusion.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.311
The super-photons
may be creating
a hallucinogenic effect.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.476
All right, let's stop
this leak before we get
stuck this way.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.729
That one?
What about that one?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.063
(LAUGHS)

09:32.238 --> 09:33.398
All right, Jenna,

09:33.573 --> 09:36.531
your Christmas
adventure begins now.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.411
I feel kind of funny.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.086
Are you getting car sick?
Do not get car sick on me.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.757
Can you even get car sick?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.083
Actually, my vestibular
system is quite sensitive,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.421
but this is different.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.510
Oh! Deer crossing here!

10:01.893 --> 10:02.803
This is different.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.558
ANDY: We have a problem.
You think?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.188
Why do you look
like the Tin Man?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.974
Why do you look
like Dudley Do-Right?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.488
Hmm. I do.
