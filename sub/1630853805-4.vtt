WEBVTT

01:00.758 --> 01:02.482
Nothing happened.

01:02.586 --> 01:05.482
I'm a happily married man.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.517
Bette, this is my wife Letitia
and Jackie Rohr.

01:19.724 --> 01:22.931
You don't work
for the FBI anymore.

01:24.448 --> 01:26.724
You work for us.

01:40.241 --> 01:41.206
Jenny!

01:41.310 --> 01:43.206
Son of a bitch!

01:43.310 --> 01:46.172
I thought we agreed that you
weren't gonna call your father.

01:46.275 --> 01:49.965
No, you agreed, and you forgot
to consult with me, as usual.

01:56.482 --> 01:58.793
We got you surrounded, Anton.

01:58.896 --> 02:01.103
You ain't got nowhere to go.

02:02.379 --> 02:03.758
-  Fuck.
- Fuck happened?

02:03.862 --> 02:05.793
Fucking wheeled on me, Chris.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.034
I am so sorry, Grace.

02:09.137 --> 02:11.517
I shouldn't have
trusted any of you.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.137
Officer Wallace.

02:13.241 --> 02:15.413
You know whether he was
defending himself

02:15.517 --> 02:17.862
or he executed Anton Campbell.

02:24.862 --> 02:26.137
<i>
Calling again to follow up</i>

02:26.241 --> 02:28.034
<i>on the status of
the Big Dig work logs.</i>

02:28.137 --> 02:30.137
Could you connect me
to your supervisor?

02:40.724 --> 02:43.103
I'm saying you blew
Wallace's head off.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.758
That's why you're on a desk for
the foreseeable fucking future.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.620
We need to ask you
a few questions.

03:26.586 --> 03:27.655
<i>
You had gunshot residue</i>

03:27.758 --> 03:29.241
<i>all over your hands, Chris.</i>

03:29.344 --> 03:32.206
I go to the range every Sunday.
It's part of my routine.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.275
I told you that before
I voluntarily got swabbed.

03:35.379 --> 03:38.000
If I was gonna shoot someone,
I'd go to the range, too.

03:38.103 --> 03:39.482
Hone the skills.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.344
Use that as an excuse
for a failed paraffin test.

03:42.448 --> 03:45.103
First 48 hours are critical
in a homicide investigation.

03:45.206 --> 03:46.862
You're wasting them
talking to me.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.206
Yeah, we disagree.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.517
You've got motive.
You've got access.

03:50.620 --> 03:53.344
You're good with a gun.
It's part of your routine.

03:53.448 --> 03:54.896
Everyone in your department

03:55.000 --> 03:57.344
seems to end up
dead or in cuffs.

03:57.448 --> 03:59.965
About time someone
took a look at that, no?

04:01.137 --> 04:06.137
I say this calmly
but with dwindling patience:

04:06.241 --> 04:08.793
Fuck you.

04:08.896 --> 04:11.689
-  Your backup gun.
- What about it?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.724
Please, forfeit the firearm.

04:14.827 --> 04:18.000
- Why?
- Ballistics examination.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.517
- No.
- Fine, we'll get a warrant.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.344
I got nothing to hide, fellas.

04:24.448 --> 04:26.517
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna make this easy on you,

04:26.620 --> 04:29.724
'cause I really fucking resent
the accusation.

04:29.827 --> 04:32.206
I didn't kill Rick Dunleavy.

04:35.103 --> 04:37.137
All I'm saying
is there's no reason

04:37.241 --> 04:39.137
for you to be
in that courtroom today.

04:39.241 --> 04:41.172
I'm going for the same reason
you are.

04:41.275 --> 04:44.344
- To see justice done.
- And if justice isn't done?

04:44.448 --> 04:46.862
Russ Wallace,
the only guy that can verify

04:46.965 --> 04:49.620
that Suferin is guilty, is dead.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.586
Chris Caysen
will tell what happened.

04:51.689 --> 04:54.620
Okay, Caysen didn't see
Suferin shoot Anton Campbell.

04:54.724 --> 04:56.827
And the defense has a slew
of character witnesses lined up

04:56.931 --> 04:59.206
who are willing to say
Suferin's a hero.

05:00.931 --> 05:03.344
Chris's testimony
will be enough.

05:12.827 --> 05:14.758
Are you the experimental type?

05:14.862 --> 05:16.896
You want to talk
about existential bullshit

05:17.000 --> 05:20.275
- as foreplay?
- That's not what I asked.

05:25.275 --> 05:27.034
Cocaine?

05:27.137 --> 05:29.793
Been there, done that,
got the T-shirt.

05:29.896 --> 05:34.206
I asked, are you experimental?

05:52.068 --> 05:53.137
Are you sure that Sinclair--

05:53.241 --> 05:55.103
He won't be back for hours.

06:25.448 --> 06:28.758
So, there he is, you know, after
all these years, my father.

06:28.862 --> 06:30.482
He shows up at the house
just to,

06:30.586 --> 06:32.482
you know, talk a bunch
of bullshit.

06:32.586 --> 06:36.793
No explanations, no apologies,
no kumbaya.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.689
And you gave that sucker
what he deserved,

06:38.793 --> 06:40.344
a right hook to the nose.

06:40.448 --> 06:43.344
So now he's suing me
for assault.

06:43.448 --> 06:47.551
Yeah, Jackie wants me to talk
to some a-attorney he's hired.

06:47.655 --> 06:48.896
You know, explain my side.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.862
Why haven't you?

06:53.137 --> 06:55.344
Because I'm not gonna
tell a perfect stranger

06:55.448 --> 06:58.724
about me being abused
as a child by my old man.

06:58.827 --> 07:00.517
You know?

07:00.620 --> 07:02.965
And besides, Diarmuid Doyle
said that he'd try

07:03.068 --> 07:06.068
to talk the bastard
out of the lawsuit, so...

07:07.793 --> 07:11.000
Shit, I just feel like I've lost
my opportunity, you know?

07:11.103 --> 07:13.379
But not to... not to have
my dad back in my life--

07:13.482 --> 07:16.413
believe me, I don't want that--
but...

07:16.517 --> 07:19.448
to try to make some kind
of peace with the past.

07:19.551 --> 07:23.241
Best way to make peace
with the past? Amnesia.

07:23.344 --> 07:27.241
Yeah. I wish it was that simple.

07:28.862 --> 07:32.103
You know, I know that my dad
cheated on my mom.

07:33.137 --> 07:35.206
Christ, why do
all men cheat? I...

07:36.172 --> 07:37.724
Suddenly, I don't think
we're talking

07:37.827 --> 07:39.517
about your father anymore.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.620
Yeah.

07:42.724 --> 07:44.137
You know, I-I...

07:44.241 --> 07:46.724
Jackie's been unfaithful to me
so many times.

07:46.827 --> 07:48.862
But, you know, I...
Sue, I honestly thought

07:48.965 --> 07:50.724
we were past all that shit.

07:50.827 --> 07:53.896
Until... Oh, thanks.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.241
Until last night.

07:55.344 --> 07:58.448
I'm lying in bed all alone,

07:58.551 --> 08:01.379
- and I just get this feeling.
- Oh, yeah.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.827
I know that feeling. In the gut.

08:03.931 --> 08:07.000
Yeah. And here. You know?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.413
Any idea who he's
fucking around with?

08:11.517 --> 08:13.965
Not exactly.

08:14.068 --> 08:15.517
But he started acting squirrelly

08:15.620 --> 08:18.034
when he got that job
with the Dryden family.

08:18.137 --> 08:21.172
Oh. Letitia.

08:21.275 --> 08:24.068
She loves torturing squirrels.

08:26.724 --> 08:28.689
Apparently,
I'm the only suspect.

08:28.793 --> 08:30.275
But you didn't shoot anybody.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.206
And submitting your pistol
will help prove that.

08:32.310 --> 08:34.241
So why force them
to get a court order?

08:34.344 --> 08:36.172
Because I want the paper trail.

08:36.275 --> 08:38.241
I'm about to testify
against Tony Suferin,

08:38.344 --> 08:40.448
put him away for killing
Anton Campbell.

08:40.551 --> 08:44.724
This is an attempt, by my
brothers in blue, to stop me.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.965
- Then don't.
- Don't what?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.862
- Testify.
- Maggie.

08:49.965 --> 08:51.724
We've been through this.
I have to.

08:51.827 --> 08:53.827
No. You want to.

08:53.931 --> 08:55.344
Well, I don't want you to.

08:55.448 --> 08:58.137
I have to,
'cause Russ Wallace can't.

08:58.241 --> 09:01.206
Just forget about Russ
for a second

09:01.310 --> 09:02.896
and think about yourself.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.517
Proving your innocence.

09:06.551 --> 09:07.931
Hey, Chris...

09:08.034 --> 09:10.758
I can just say that I was
with you the entire night.

09:10.862 --> 09:12.482
I-If your "brothers in blue"
are willing

09:12.586 --> 09:14.482
to fudge the truth,
then so am I.

09:14.586 --> 09:16.758
No, I won't have you
committing perjury.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.862
Fine.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.172
Then go to prison.

09:23.965 --> 09:27.103
- And what do we tell the kids?
- For now? Nothing.

09:35.655 --> 09:37.206
Morning, Dee-Cee.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.965
What's happened, man? Why are
you in Boston? What's wrong?

09:39.068 --> 09:42.448
Why do you always assume
the worst? Jesus Christ, man.

09:42.551 --> 09:44.448
I'm driving up to Maine.
Figured I'd stop on the way

09:44.551 --> 09:46.068
and see my brother
and his wonderful wife.

09:46.172 --> 09:47.379
Oh, they ain't got
telephones in New York?

09:47.482 --> 09:48.896
Nope, only carrier pigeons.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.482
- Not very reliable.
- Uh-huh.

09:51.586 --> 09:54.758
That's why I wanted
to deliver this myself.

09:58.413 --> 10:00.689
"One thousand
one hundred twelve dollars

10:00.793 --> 10:02.206
and sixty-two cents."

10:02.310 --> 10:04.758
The payout from Pop's
insurance policy.

10:04.862 --> 10:07.241
It's your half.

10:07.344 --> 10:08.965
Two thousand two hundred
twenty-five dollars

10:09.068 --> 10:10.448
and twenty-four cents?

10:10.551 --> 10:13.275
The value of a life. Goddamn.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.344
Yeah, broke my heart, too.

10:16.275 --> 10:17.275
Hey, man, you should...

10:17.379 --> 10:18.586
- you should take it.
- Oh, no.

10:18.689 --> 10:20.448
Come on. Come on,
you took care of Pop.

10:20.551 --> 10:22.275
- You deserve it
- Look, he told me emphatically,

10:22.379 --> 10:24.137
"Make sure Decourcy
gets his fair share,"

10:24.241 --> 10:25.482
so please don't do
what you always do

10:25.586 --> 10:26.896
and complicate the situation.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.241
- Just--
- All right.

10:28.344 --> 10:31.448
And at some point,

10:31.551 --> 10:34.862
we have to talk about
what to do with the house.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.206
We can't sell our home.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.793
Well, what other choice
is there?

10:37.896 --> 10:40.758
Turn the place into the Franklin
and Eudora Ward Museum?

10:40.862 --> 10:43.344
- You could live there.
- Oh, give up my condo,

10:43.448 --> 10:44.827
with the doorman
and the maintenance guy,

10:44.931 --> 10:46.620
to spend the rest of my life
shoveling snow

10:46.724 --> 10:48.724
- and fixing the boiler?

10:48.827 --> 10:50.103
Pass.

10:50.206 --> 10:51.689
Look, Brownsville's
on the upswing.

10:51.793 --> 10:54.482
Okay? There's a lot
of hedge funders, ad execs,

10:54.586 --> 10:57.413
lawyers looking to buy
and rehab old houses.

10:57.517 --> 10:59.793
We could make a chunk of change.

10:59.896 --> 11:02.379
- Louie?
- Oh.

11:02.482 --> 11:04.620
- What brings you to Boston?
- Hey. I'm going up to Maine.

11:04.724 --> 11:06.965
- Oh. Why Maine of all places?

11:07.068 --> 11:08.689
Never been.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.413
My only view of the Atlantic's
been patrolling Howard Beach.

11:11.517 --> 11:13.689
I'd like to see some trees.

11:13.793 --> 11:16.275
Or maybe a deer or two.

11:16.379 --> 11:18.931
You gonna drive ten hours
just to see some trees?

11:19.034 --> 11:21.241
I'm taking the week.

11:21.344 --> 11:23.413
To get my mind right.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.448
- You should do the same.
- Oh, I will.

11:25.551 --> 11:27.517
Once everything at work
settles down.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.103
Speaking of which,
we're due in court.

11:35.517 --> 11:37.379
So this is where you found
Dunleavy's body?

11:37.482 --> 11:40.310
Lying on his back, blood
gurgling out of his mouth.

11:40.413 --> 11:42.482
According to the file,
homicide canvassed the area

11:42.586 --> 11:46.482
for witnesses,
but no one saw or heard a thing.

11:46.586 --> 11:48.137
True.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.344
None of the apartments have
a clear view of this location.

11:51.448 --> 11:53.448
That's right,
it's a dealing spot.

11:53.551 --> 11:55.241
Yep.

11:55.344 --> 11:58.241
Here's what I need you
to tell me.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.379
Any of the pushers show
any signs of fear

12:00.482 --> 12:02.551
since Dunleavy was shot?

12:05.379 --> 12:07.103
Harry Hall.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.517
-  Hey, Harry.
- Oh, shit, Caysen.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.827
Hey. Why are you running
away from me?

12:17.586 --> 12:20.241
Get any closer,
I'm-a light yo ass up.

12:20.344 --> 12:21.793
Harry, stop.
I just want to talk.

12:21.896 --> 12:23.448
Fuck off.

12:23.551 --> 12:26.379
I don't feel like talking to
no white bitch with a side part.

12:26.482 --> 12:28.241
Look, you know me, kid.

12:28.344 --> 12:30.103
If you're in danger, I can help.

12:32.034 --> 12:34.965
Look, I'm just gonna sit here.

12:35.068 --> 12:37.275
Stand wherever you like.

12:37.379 --> 12:39.275
Feel free to keep
holding the knife

12:39.379 --> 12:40.758
if that makes you feel safe,

12:40.862 --> 12:43.034
but you might want
to hide the thing a little,

12:43.137 --> 12:46.620
so no old lady
comes down, screams.

12:51.482 --> 12:53.379
You were with Rick Dunleavy
when he was shot?

12:53.482 --> 12:55.620
- If I squeal, you gonna cap me.
- Harry, I swear

12:55.724 --> 12:58.551
on the souls of my children,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

12:58.655 --> 13:00.241
In fact, I can protect you.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.275
Step one: tell me who
you need protection from.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.758
Not a chance.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.275
Who's there?

13:11.448 --> 13:12.862
You sent for me?

13:12.965 --> 13:14.655
Jackie. Come on in.

13:19.172 --> 13:20.655
Anita Baker, live at the Common.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.344
- Quite a night, huh?
- Hmm.

13:23.448 --> 13:26.379
You fucked up a childhood
kidnapping case. Gruesome.

13:26.482 --> 13:28.586
You stood there
in my office, lost.

13:28.689 --> 13:30.551
Thought your career was over.

13:30.655 --> 13:33.931
I invited you to go see Anita.

13:34.034 --> 13:36.103
Huh? That very night.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.275
And she sang "Sweet Love" twice,

13:38.379 --> 13:40.413
once with the band
and once a cappella.

13:40.517 --> 13:42.103
That song was the only thing
in my head

13:42.206 --> 13:43.655
for the next six months.

13:43.758 --> 13:47.206
Yeah, and soon enough,
you were back on track,

13:47.310 --> 13:50.724
skilled, confident, brutal.

13:50.827 --> 13:53.137
Hey, listen, Jackie,

13:53.241 --> 13:57.034
last evening, the young woman
with whom you saw me--

13:57.137 --> 13:59.758
- Didn't see anything.
- Exactly.

13:59.862 --> 14:04.241
Just like I didn't see you
this morning, with my wife.

14:08.655 --> 14:10.206
Uh, yeah, that's that...

14:10.310 --> 14:12.724
that's the exact expression
that you had years ago.

14:12.827 --> 14:16.413
I'll say now what I said then:
there is no cause for alarm.

14:16.517 --> 14:18.172
I mean that.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.724
You can go now.

14:45.241 --> 14:48.034
<i>-♪ That's not the way... ♪</i>
-  Morning, Grace.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.517
Morning, Grace.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.137
- Grace?
- Oh, my God.

14:52.241 --> 14:54.068
Sorry, I didn't see you.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.241
Hey, so...

14:56.344 --> 14:57.758
It's a big day. You ready?

14:57.862 --> 15:01.655
Whatever God has in store,
I'll accept.

15:01.758 --> 15:03.482
Even if the verdict
is not guilty.

15:03.586 --> 15:05.413
Oh, we're not even gonna
put that energy out there.

15:05.517 --> 15:07.103
Suferin's going to jail.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.551
The day a white cop goes to jail
for ending a Black man's life,

15:10.655 --> 15:13.000
hmm, pigs will be flying.

15:14.827 --> 15:16.620
I got to go speak
to the prosecutor.

15:16.724 --> 15:18.310
I'll see you inside.

15:20.724 --> 15:22.551
Anton wasn't a saint.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.689
I pray for his soul every night.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.827
He had blood on his hands.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.689
So if this was God's will
for him...

15:28.793 --> 15:32.551
Cops don't get to play God
and take a life, okay?

15:32.655 --> 15:35.931
No one gets to do that
without facing consequences.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.689
I know this is a lot
for you, too.

15:40.931 --> 15:43.896
Reliving everything
that happened.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.896
And you still came.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.310
Want me to pray?

16:04.931 --> 16:09.448
Father God, it's me,
your humble servant Grace,

16:09.551 --> 16:12.724
coming on behalf
of your children,

16:12.827 --> 16:16.620
asking that you may have mercy
upon us and guide our steps,

16:16.724 --> 16:18.862
so as we do our best

16:18.965 --> 16:22.413
to live your word in this life,

16:22.517 --> 16:24.793
we ask you for strength, Father.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.137
Bless Siobhan, Father God,

16:27.241 --> 16:30.482
your diligent servant

16:30.586 --> 16:34.517
fighting for your people.
Our people.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.137
Give her the fortitude
to face another day.

16:37.241 --> 16:40.310
Let her know that weeping
may endure for a night,

16:40.413 --> 16:42.275
but joy cometh in the morning.

16:42.379 --> 16:45.379
These things we ask
in the name of the Father,

16:45.482 --> 16:48.448
Son and Holy Spirit.

16:48.551 --> 16:50.103
Amen.

16:51.931 --> 16:53.103
Amen.

16:54.896 --> 16:57.655
Let's watch the Lord work.

17:15.448 --> 17:17.034
Rohr here.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.655
<i>Hey, you
coming home for dinner tonight?</i>

17:18.758 --> 17:20.068
I don't know yet.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.206
The, uh, surveillance system
is still broken.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.758
I'm waiting on the repairman.

17:23.862 --> 17:25.379
<i>He's, like,
an hour late already.</i>

17:25.482 --> 17:27.103
Oh. Okay, so you're, uh...

17:27.206 --> 17:29.068
you're gonna stay
out again all night?

17:29.172 --> 17:31.482
What are you talking about?
I came home last night.

17:31.586 --> 17:33.137
<i>Barely.</i>

17:33.241 --> 17:36.310
Jennifer, how many times
do I have to say this?

17:36.413 --> 17:37.655
New job,

17:37.758 --> 17:39.034
<i>working long hours,</i>

17:39.137 --> 17:41.206
<i>trying to make
a good impression.</i>

17:41.310 --> 17:43.379
Yeah, who you trying to impress?

17:43.482 --> 17:46.517
I mean, the master of the house
or, uh... or the mistress?

17:46.620 --> 17:49.103
What the hell is that crack
supposed to mean?

17:49.206 --> 17:52.137
<i>I...</i>

17:54.551 --> 17:56.551
Are you...

17:58.344 --> 18:00.103
Jackie...

18:02.689 --> 18:05.275
...our house is so empty.

18:07.793 --> 18:09.965
All right, look.

18:10.068 --> 18:12.448
I'll be home for dinner.
All right?

18:12.551 --> 18:15.172
Uh, we'll watch some football.

18:15.275 --> 18:16.758
The Cowboys/Redskins.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.275
<i>Monday night game.</i>

18:18.379 --> 18:22.310
Okay, yeah, I-I'll even
watch football with you.

18:22.413 --> 18:25.172
Did you go see that lawyer
about the assault?

18:25.275 --> 18:28.275
Tomorrow. Maybe.

18:28.379 --> 18:29.793
Okay.

18:29.896 --> 18:31.965
- Okay. <i>
- See you later.</i>

18:45.793 --> 18:48.310
Regarding the defendant,

18:48.413 --> 18:53.034
have you ever heard him use
racially charged words?

18:53.137 --> 18:54.206
Yeah.

18:54.310 --> 18:56.275
Things like, uh,

18:56.379 --> 18:59.517
"Let's go 'N' hunting."

18:59.620 --> 19:04.689
Or worse, he'd get physical,
strip-search Black people.

19:04.793 --> 19:07.000
More than with white people?

19:07.827 --> 19:09.275
Never white people.

19:09.379 --> 19:13.344
Let's go back to the day
of Anton Campbell's death.

19:13.448 --> 19:15.034
I want to focus your attention

19:15.137 --> 19:17.689
on the moment just prior
to the gunshot.

19:17.793 --> 19:19.827
Uh, I told my men
to hold their fire.

19:19.931 --> 19:23.827
Then, over the radio,
I instructed Suferin and Wallace

19:23.931 --> 19:25.827
to maintain the rear perimeter.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.965
"Do not engage," I said.

19:28.068 --> 19:30.413
Suferin acknowledged my orders
but defied 'em.

19:30.517 --> 19:34.275
He entered the house, approached
Anton Campbell from behind,

19:34.379 --> 19:36.586
then Suferin shot him.

19:38.275 --> 19:41.172
Did you see the
defendant shoot Mr. Campbell?

19:41.275 --> 19:42.862
No.

19:44.724 --> 19:46.448
But he told me that he did.

19:46.551 --> 19:48.551
Unabashedly.

19:53.379 --> 19:57.000
Please, tell us his exact words.

19:58.517 --> 20:00.379
Suferin said, uh,

20:00.482 --> 20:04.724
"Anton wasn't gonna surrender,
so I took a chance and fired."

20:04.827 --> 20:07.344
Bullshit.
I said more than that, Chris.

20:07.448 --> 20:11.068
Mr. Suferin,
you will refrain from speaking.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.793
It's bullshit.

20:20.103 --> 20:21.517
So, did you lean
on Father Doyle?

20:21.620 --> 20:22.896
I did.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.413
- Did you get him to confess?
- I didn't.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.206
Jesus, Milani,

20:27.310 --> 20:29.931
he stole money from the parish
to buy guns for the fucking IRA.

20:30.034 --> 20:32.206
There's no proof of that.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.862
Well, what do you want, the IRA
to give you a fucking receipt?

20:34.965 --> 20:36.103
If I was still with the Bureau,

20:36.206 --> 20:37.620
I would've nailed
this fucking guy.

20:37.724 --> 20:39.448
Like Jesus to the cross.

20:39.551 --> 20:42.103
I got that autopsy you wanted.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.896
Dominique Zanghi died
of a codeine overdose.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.965
Unprescribed, I assume.

20:47.068 --> 20:49.275
- Codeine?
- There's more.

20:49.379 --> 20:51.344
The deceased had traces
of latex in her vagina,

20:51.448 --> 20:53.586
which usually indicates
sex with a condom.

20:53.689 --> 20:56.172
No bruising,
no defense injuries.

20:56.275 --> 20:59.965
Toxicology also found quaaludes
in her bloodstream.

21:00.068 --> 21:02.827
As you well know,
quaaludes are illegal.

21:02.931 --> 21:04.586
Quite a party.

21:04.689 --> 21:07.931
Sedatives followed by evidence
of intercourse could mean rape.

21:10.275 --> 21:12.896
Jackie, if anything untoward
is going on,

21:13.000 --> 21:14.896
you'll let me know, right?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.068
You'll be the first.

21:32.724 --> 21:34.517
Fuck.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.103
During this standoff,

21:36.206 --> 21:39.206
you knew Anton Campbell
was armed, correct?

21:39.310 --> 21:40.586
Correct.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.241
How did you know he was armed?

21:42.344 --> 21:43.620
He fired a round.

21:43.724 --> 21:47.068
At you and the other
police officers?

21:47.172 --> 21:51.206
Uh, possibly. Hard to guess
where his mind was at.

21:51.310 --> 21:56.172
Anton Campbell's arrest record
is filled with acts of violence.

21:56.275 --> 21:57.758
- Objection.
- Judge Vela,

21:57.862 --> 21:59.275
he was the primary suspect

21:59.379 --> 22:01.793
in multiple homicide investigations,

22:01.896 --> 22:03.586
all of which involved a firearm.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.827
My client knew that, and Caysen
knew my client knew that,

22:06.931 --> 22:08.413
which goes to justification.

22:08.517 --> 22:10.517
I'll allow.

22:11.482 --> 22:14.862
Knowing Campbell's
history of violence,

22:14.965 --> 22:17.965
putting two and two together,

22:18.068 --> 22:20.862
Anthony Suferin
probably saved the lives

22:20.965 --> 22:23.241
of his fellow officers.

22:23.344 --> 22:24.862
Possibly yours.

22:27.275 --> 22:31.448
I gave my orders.
Suferin disobeyed them.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.448
A man died needlessly.

22:33.551 --> 22:35.965
If, as you seem to think,

22:36.068 --> 22:39.344
Officer Suferin
was such a bad cop,

22:39.448 --> 22:42.689
why did you keep him on the
Youth Strike Force for so long?

22:42.793 --> 22:45.758
Three years.
Why not transfer him?

22:45.862 --> 22:50.379
Aren't you, in part, responsible
for the death of Anton Campbell

22:50.482 --> 22:53.068
by bringing Officer Suferin
on the raid that day?

22:53.172 --> 22:55.310
Objection. Your Honor.

22:55.413 --> 22:57.034
Withdrawn.

22:57.827 --> 23:00.103
Last question.

23:00.206 --> 23:03.310
You attacked the reputation
of Officer Rick Dunleavy,

23:03.413 --> 23:08.241
but aren't you currently
under suspicion for his murder?

23:08.344 --> 23:09.517
Objection.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.965
Sustained. Mr. Devlin, move on.

23:12.068 --> 23:14.206
The jury will disregard.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.103
I don't want to hear
another question in this area.

23:17.206 --> 23:19.379
This question is stricken.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.034
My answer is no.

23:21.137 --> 23:22.965
Do you want to win
this case on merit,

23:23.068 --> 23:25.000
or do you want to lose
'cause of ego?

23:25.103 --> 23:26.724
Jackie Rohr was there
when Suferin admitted

23:26.827 --> 23:28.482
to killing Anton Campbell.

23:28.586 --> 23:30.206
Put Jackie on the stand.

23:30.310 --> 23:32.068
Suferin's lawyer will object.

23:32.172 --> 23:34.206
You brought Jackie up
in trial prep.

23:34.310 --> 23:37.586
And you can convince
Judge Vela to let him testify.

23:37.689 --> 23:40.310
Jesus.

23:40.413 --> 23:42.413
Jackie Rohr.

23:45.103 --> 23:47.586
- Yeah, I admit, it's not ideal.

23:47.689 --> 23:51.241
I am not asking that asshole
to do me any favors.

23:51.344 --> 23:53.827
You want him here,
you bring him here.

23:53.931 --> 23:55.310
Done.

24:02.241 --> 24:05.034
Well, imagine my surprise
when I get a message

24:05.137 --> 24:09.655
that A.D.A. Decourcy Ward
wants to speak with me.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.896
The impossible happens
every day, Jackie.

24:13.448 --> 24:16.413
Okay, before you tell me
what you're after,

24:16.517 --> 24:19.482
let-let me pose
a theoretical question

24:19.586 --> 24:21.103
about a moral dilemma.

24:21.206 --> 24:26.034
Let's say a girl is given
a quaalude and then raped--

24:26.137 --> 24:28.517
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why are you asking me this?

24:28.620 --> 24:30.172
Jesus Christ, Dee.

24:30.275 --> 24:32.551
I'm a lot of fucking things.
I'm not a fucking rapist.

24:32.655 --> 24:33.931
Then who is?

24:34.034 --> 24:36.103
I told you,
it's-it's theoretical.

24:36.206 --> 24:38.379
I'm writing a mystery novel.

24:38.482 --> 24:41.206
Working title is <i>
Don't Be a Dipshit.</i> What?

24:41.310 --> 24:42.655
I'm just wondering how the OPR

24:42.758 --> 24:45.275
could've ever found you unprofessional.

24:45.379 --> 24:47.482
"I aimed at the public's heart,

24:47.586 --> 24:49.758
and by accident,
I hit it in the stomach."

24:49.862 --> 24:53.482
Oh, no, you-you...
taking the quote out of context.

24:53.586 --> 24:55.758
What, you thought
you were the only one

24:55.862 --> 24:57.103
who read Upton Sinclair?

24:57.206 --> 24:58.965
You know, Dee,

24:59.068 --> 25:01.206
I think you might
be my fucking soul mate.

25:01.310 --> 25:04.068
Oh? Well, you...
you-you should write a book.

25:04.172 --> 25:06.379
Yeah, you should,
you should. Call it...

25:06.482 --> 25:10.275
<i>Landing on My Feet</i>
by the great Jackie Rohr.

25:10.379 --> 25:11.827
All right, you know what?

25:11.931 --> 25:14.000
Next time I have
an ethical quandary,

25:14.103 --> 25:16.241
I'll go see Zelda
the fucking fortune teller.

25:16.344 --> 25:18.206
Now, why am I here?
What do you need?

25:18.310 --> 25:20.344
The angels
of your better nature.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.103
Oh, yeah, for that,
you should've called

25:22.206 --> 25:24.241
Billy Graham
or that nun in India.

25:24.344 --> 25:26.655
Jackie, I want you
to take the stand

25:26.758 --> 25:28.344
in the trial of Tony Suferin.

25:28.448 --> 25:30.448
I would rather hump a corpse.

25:30.551 --> 25:33.586
Russ Wallace is dead.
Killed by unfriendly fire.

25:33.689 --> 25:37.758
No, he killed himself when
he agreed to rat on Suferin.

25:37.862 --> 25:39.137
You got Wallace to admit

25:39.241 --> 25:40.758
that Suferin shot Campbell
in cold blood,

25:40.862 --> 25:43.448
and you were there when Suferin
admitted that he did.

25:43.551 --> 25:45.551
This has got to be killing you.

25:45.655 --> 25:47.000
What?

25:47.103 --> 25:48.896
Asking me for a favor.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.620
Uh, it's technically
not a favor.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.482
I'm not prosecuting Suferin.

25:53.586 --> 25:57.172
Oh, right, yeah,
it's a federal case,

25:57.275 --> 25:58.689
so the prosecutor is--

25:58.793 --> 26:00.310
Karen Shimizu.

26:00.413 --> 26:04.068
Then, absolutely, emphatically,
no fucking way.

26:04.172 --> 26:06.310
All right, yeah. I...

26:06.413 --> 26:08.310
I-I thought you'd say that.

26:09.551 --> 26:10.758
What's that?

26:12.068 --> 26:14.275
- Subpoena.

26:21.482 --> 26:23.965
We've been here over an hour.

26:24.068 --> 26:26.344
- Am I boring you?

26:26.448 --> 26:29.172
Given the circumstances,
boring is a good thing.

26:31.137 --> 26:32.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

26:34.103 --> 26:35.482
Sweet mother of God.

26:35.586 --> 26:37.793
- Is that Letitia?
-  That's her.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.068
-  Oh, my...
- Yep.

26:40.172 --> 26:42.206
Well...

26:42.310 --> 26:43.620
I'm gonna go talk to her.

26:43.724 --> 26:45.137
No.

26:50.482 --> 26:52.103
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

26:52.206 --> 26:54.448
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

26:54.551 --> 26:55.793
I solemnly do.

26:55.896 --> 26:58.068
Please be seated.

27:01.655 --> 27:02.896
Mr. Rohr.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.103
Ms. Shimizu.

27:07.896 --> 27:11.862
You were an agent in the
Boston FBI, is that correct?

27:11.965 --> 27:15.931
I was a highly decorated
and regarded FBI special agent

27:16.034 --> 27:17.586
for 19 years, yes.

27:17.689 --> 27:21.241
And in those 19 years,
were you ever disciplined

27:21.344 --> 27:23.620
or investigated for wrongdoing?

27:23.724 --> 27:26.448
Well, a couple of times, some
methods came under scrutiny,

27:26.551 --> 27:31.448
but all of my cases ended in
commendations and convictions.

27:31.551 --> 27:34.172
I was clean as a houndstooth.

27:36.758 --> 27:40.517
You interviewed BPD Officer
Russell Wallace

27:40.620 --> 27:44.655
regarding his responsibility
in the death of Anton Campbell.

27:44.758 --> 27:46.482
I did.

27:46.586 --> 27:49.793
You then witnessed
Officer Wallace

27:49.896 --> 27:51.965
sign this statement

27:52.068 --> 27:54.655
- to that effect.
- I did.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.758
On the day
of Anton Campbell's death,

27:57.862 --> 28:02.206
did you overhear the defendant
talking to Sergeant Caysen?

28:02.310 --> 28:03.827
I did.

28:03.931 --> 28:05.517
Tell us what was said.

28:05.620 --> 28:09.586
Well, Suferin had clearly
disobeyed Caysen's orders,

28:09.689 --> 28:12.965
'cause he was saying
that Campbell posed a threat,

28:13.068 --> 28:16.896
and then he said, "I fired."

28:17.000 --> 28:19.896
Thank you, Mr. Rohr.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.689
Always a pleasure, Ms. Shimizu.

28:22.793 --> 28:24.413
Your witness.

28:24.517 --> 28:28.862
Mr. Rohr, was anyone other
than Sergeant Caysen present

28:28.965 --> 28:33.068
when you eavesdropped
on this alleged conversation?

28:33.172 --> 28:34.310
Officer Wallace.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.758
Who, sadly, can't testify.

28:37.862 --> 28:42.517
Didn't Officer Suferin
say more than "I fired"?

28:42.620 --> 28:47.241
Didn't he say, "Campbell
wheeled around toward me"?

28:48.965 --> 28:51.310
No, I didn't hear him say that.

28:51.413 --> 28:54.137
Mr. Rohr, you're under oath.

28:56.689 --> 29:01.241
Look, pal,
Boston cops are notorious

29:01.344 --> 29:03.103
for covering each other's asses.

29:03.206 --> 29:04.689
FBI does the same thing.

29:04.793 --> 29:07.862
So why would two respected
law enforcement officers--

29:07.965 --> 29:11.448
me and Caysen--
get up here and lie about a cop?

29:11.551 --> 29:12.896
Lie on behalf of a cop, sure.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.482
Lie about a cop shooting
a Black kid? No. Uh-uh.

29:16.586 --> 29:18.965
Not unless we were
telling the truth.

29:22.034 --> 29:23.965
No further questions.

29:24.068 --> 29:26.068
Thank you, Mr. Rohr.

29:26.172 --> 29:28.241
Thank you for your testimony.

29:28.344 --> 29:31.448
Ms. Shimizu, do you have
any further witnesses?

29:31.551 --> 29:34.379
No, Your Honor.
The prosecution rests.

29:34.482 --> 29:36.103
In the matter
of <i>The United States</i>

29:36.206 --> 29:38.758
<i>v. Anthony Suferin,</i> case number

29:38.862 --> 29:43.586
3:93-CR-621426,

29:43.689 --> 29:46.206
we, the jury
of the above entitled action,

29:46.310 --> 29:49.344
find the defendant
Anthony Suferin guilty

29:49.448 --> 29:52.413
of causing death
under color of law,

29:52.517 --> 29:54.517
a felony against Anton Campbell.

29:55.896 --> 29:58.448
The defendant is remanded.

29:59.448 --> 30:01.724
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

30:01.827 --> 30:04.965
I want to thank you
for your time and attention.

30:05.068 --> 30:07.689
You are dismissed.

30:15.034 --> 30:16.827
I got to admit, I...

30:16.931 --> 30:19.689
I'm pretty stunned they found
Tony Suferin guilty.

30:19.793 --> 30:23.068
Yeah, I wasn't
expecting us to win, either.

30:23.172 --> 30:25.034
Doesn't really feel like we won.

30:25.137 --> 30:27.379
I wish I felt like we did.

30:27.482 --> 30:30.758
A win for Henry Dumas,
Michael Stewart,

30:30.862 --> 30:34.448
Eleanor Bumpurs,
Willie Turks, but...

30:34.551 --> 30:36.862
No, no, no,
we didn't win for them.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.241
We won for--

30:38.344 --> 30:39.655
Anton Campbell.

30:39.758 --> 30:41.965
Yeah, Anton fucking Campbell.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.793
Hey, you, uh... you ever hear
the name Sam Hose?

30:48.965 --> 30:51.413
Nah, most people haven't.

30:52.379 --> 30:54.275
He was lynched in Georgia.

30:54.379 --> 30:56.620
A crowd of thousands,
including children,

30:56.724 --> 30:58.758
all gathered to watch him die.

30:58.862 --> 31:01.379
They sold pieces of his corpse
as souvenirs

31:01.482 --> 31:02.620
at the local grocery store.

31:02.724 --> 31:04.620
25 cents for a bit of bone.

31:04.724 --> 31:08.275
Hey, somebody stole his heart--
his-his fucking heart--

31:08.379 --> 31:10.517
stole it,
gave it to the governor.

31:10.620 --> 31:13.103
- It's fucking horrible.
- But not uncommon.

31:13.206 --> 31:16.965
The monsters who committed that
long list of heinous crimes,

31:17.068 --> 31:18.137
they were never punished.

31:18.241 --> 31:19.896
There was no justice.

31:20.862 --> 31:23.862
So we may have won today, but...

31:25.310 --> 31:28.000
...the score is still
10,000 to one.

31:37.379 --> 31:40.551
Stop. Stop the car.

31:42.344 --> 31:45.724
- Stop the car.
- Siobhan.

31:45.827 --> 31:47.724
Siobhan?

31:47.827 --> 31:50.413
Siobhan, hey, hey.
Siobhan, baby.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.551
- You're okay.

31:52.655 --> 31:55.275
We're not in that car.
We're miles away.

31:57.068 --> 31:58.448
All right?

31:59.586 --> 32:01.862
Hey, it's okay, baby, all right?

32:03.758 --> 32:06.000
All right? I got you.

32:07.482 --> 32:09.379
I got you.

32:17.068 --> 32:18.344
<i>
Jackie.</i>

32:18.448 --> 32:19.862
Jackie!

32:21.517 --> 32:23.793
Jackie,
didn't you hear me calling?

32:23.896 --> 32:26.034
Get up. You're late for work.

32:26.137 --> 32:30.655
Oh, Jesus, I haven't seen
that look since Mom lived here.

32:33.103 --> 32:35.517
Things okay at Mr. Dryden's?

32:35.620 --> 32:37.206
I mean, not so long ago,
you were

32:37.310 --> 32:38.586
hopping out of bed whistling.

32:38.689 --> 32:40.310
You couldn't wait to get
out to Beacon Hill.

32:40.413 --> 32:43.827
Jesus Christ, I'm fucking up.

32:43.931 --> 32:45.862
All right?

32:49.137 --> 32:50.827
I know what this is.

32:50.931 --> 32:54.862
Yeah, you've always been on
your own clock, your own hours,

32:54.965 --> 32:56.862
answering to nobody.

32:56.965 --> 32:59.241
Yeah, but now you punch in
a real clock,

32:59.344 --> 33:02.724
you know, filling out, uh,
invoices or whatever.

33:04.827 --> 33:07.586
You're having
to compromise yourself,

33:07.689 --> 33:09.931
and you're miserable about it.

33:10.034 --> 33:11.793
I mean, last night,
all you could talk about

33:11.896 --> 33:14.034
was testifying
at that cop's murder trial.

33:14.137 --> 33:15.344
You know? And...

33:17.793 --> 33:19.689
You miss the old job.

33:19.793 --> 33:23.413
- You miss being in the FBI.
- Bullshit.

33:26.103 --> 33:27.379
Fine. Okay.

33:27.482 --> 33:29.724
Suit yourself.

33:38.206 --> 33:40.862
Just give him
an hour with his son.

33:40.965 --> 33:44.482
I'm asking
as the prosecuting attorney.

33:44.586 --> 33:46.655
Thank you, Warden.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.724
Yeah, uh, all right, well,
after the first visit,

33:49.827 --> 33:52.965
let's talk about setting up
a regular schedule.

33:53.068 --> 33:55.793
All right. I'll do that.

33:55.896 --> 33:58.000
Goodbye.

33:58.103 --> 34:00.172
When are you taking
Whitaker to trial?

34:00.275 --> 34:02.965
Uh, when and if I'm ready.

34:03.068 --> 34:04.689
I've been digging
into the case files

34:04.793 --> 34:06.724
of Officers Plunkett and Knoche.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.241
You know over 20
of their affidavits,

34:08.344 --> 34:10.862
including Whitaker's,
have been signed by the same CI?

34:10.965 --> 34:11.862
Tex Kramer?

34:11.965 --> 34:14.103
Hmm. That's definitely hinky.

34:14.206 --> 34:17.103
Yeah. Yeah, this guy Kramer,
he might be the key.

34:17.206 --> 34:20.827
Good news: Nehemiah Powell
is now officially incarcerated.

34:20.931 --> 34:22.620
The Camden Fish Market
is giving us

34:22.724 --> 34:24.310
all the free lobster we can eat.

34:27.620 --> 34:30.000
Uh, congratulations? Uh...

34:30.965 --> 34:32.379
You've got a great track record.

34:32.482 --> 34:34.137
I'm simply playing catch-up.

34:35.965 --> 34:38.206
I had intended to give
this case to you, Decourcy,

34:38.310 --> 34:40.103
but since Blair's on a roll...

34:41.379 --> 34:43.448
Fanatic blew up
an abortion clinic.

34:43.551 --> 34:44.827
Killed two people.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.448
Defense is claiming
he's schizophrenic.

34:47.551 --> 34:49.344
Mental health is a real problem.

34:49.448 --> 34:52.413
I'll try to find some compassion
before I toss this jerk

34:52.517 --> 34:54.379
two consecutive life sentences.

34:54.482 --> 34:56.482
Mm. Why do I get the feeling

34:56.586 --> 34:59.517
that you two staged this little
piece of performance art?

35:13.413 --> 35:14.551
Hello, Pepe.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.793
Hi, Miss Quays.

35:16.896 --> 35:18.517
I talked to the doctor.

35:18.620 --> 35:21.379
She says there's been no change?

35:21.482 --> 35:23.000
Not yet.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Timothy O'Brien?

35:42.896 --> 35:44.310
My name is Siobhan Quays.

35:44.413 --> 35:46.482
I am the attorney
representing Hernando Mendoza.

35:46.586 --> 35:48.448
May we talk?

35:48.551 --> 35:50.241
Sorry, not interested.

35:53.931 --> 35:56.413
Were you on site
when Hernando was injured?

35:56.517 --> 35:58.310
Please don't drag me into this.

35:58.413 --> 35:59.758
Do you have kids, Mr. O'Brien?

35:59.862 --> 36:01.862
Why? You gonna stalk them, too?

36:01.965 --> 36:03.586
I went through the shift logs.

36:03.689 --> 36:06.206
You and Mendoza
worked together often.

36:06.310 --> 36:08.620
More often than most
crew members.

36:08.724 --> 36:10.758
Then I looked you up
and I realized

36:10.862 --> 36:13.206
you two live
in the same neighborhood.

36:13.310 --> 36:15.103
Yeah. We're neighbors.

36:15.206 --> 36:19.482
His son Pepe,
he asked me to come talk to you.

36:19.586 --> 36:22.586
Figured you'd want to make sure
that a tragedy like this

36:22.689 --> 36:24.896
won't happen to another family.

36:26.655 --> 36:28.310
Pepe said that?

36:39.413 --> 36:41.482
Union told us to keep quiet.

36:41.586 --> 36:43.241
Promised they and Needham
Industries had every intention

36:43.344 --> 36:45.000
of making things right
for the Mendozas.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.689
- You believe them?
- Hey, the union leaders

36:46.793 --> 36:48.379
assign us to do a job each day.

36:48.482 --> 36:51.241
Okay? I talk, I don't work.

36:51.344 --> 36:52.689
And, yeah, I do have kids.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.000
Babies, so I need the money.

36:56.413 --> 36:57.689
Has anyone threatened you?

36:57.793 --> 36:59.206
They don't have to.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.137
We all know
what they're capable of.

37:01.241 --> 37:03.931
They? Who's they?

37:06.172 --> 37:08.241
I only get a half hour
for lunch.

37:17.793 --> 37:20.310
Hey there, Charles.

37:20.413 --> 37:21.517
Rohr.

37:21.620 --> 37:24.000
Let me ask you something.

37:24.103 --> 37:26.551
The night Dominique Zanghi
was having dinner here,

37:26.655 --> 37:28.655
did you drive her home?

37:28.758 --> 37:30.620
Uh, yes.

37:30.724 --> 37:32.344
What time was that?

37:32.448 --> 37:35.379
Uh, I don't recall.

37:35.482 --> 37:36.862
Was she unconscious?

37:37.896 --> 37:40.310
I don't recall.

37:40.413 --> 37:41.896
Okay, three nights later,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.551
did you drive Dryden
to Dominique's apartment?

37:45.655 --> 37:47.758
I don't recall.

37:47.862 --> 37:50.275
Like Reagan and Iran-Contra.

37:50.379 --> 37:52.655
Suck my dick, Jackie!

37:53.965 --> 37:57.482
See? That's what I like
about you, Chuck.

37:57.586 --> 37:59.413
You're cool under pressure.

38:03.896 --> 38:05.689
And...

38:05.793 --> 38:08.827
- there you go.

38:08.931 --> 38:10.413
Ten thousand dollars.

38:10.517 --> 38:12.379
This'll give my campaign
a real boost.

38:12.482 --> 38:14.448
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather have elected

38:14.551 --> 38:18.000
attorney general of
the Massachusetts Commonwealth.

38:18.103 --> 38:20.689
Well, if there's anything
I can do in return,

38:20.793 --> 38:23.000
don't hesitate to ask.

38:25.724 --> 38:27.413
Within ethical bounds,
of course.

38:27.517 --> 38:30.310
Of course.

38:30.413 --> 38:32.206
Give my best to Letitia.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.827
And mine to Ruth.

38:39.758 --> 38:41.034
Rohr.

38:41.137 --> 38:43.758
Oh, I didn't know D.A.'s
made house calls.

38:43.862 --> 38:46.724
I heard you were working here,
licking Sinclair's ass.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.551
Check the mirror.

38:48.655 --> 38:52.241
Looks like you got a little
brown on your nose yourself.

39:05.448 --> 39:09.137
A BPD informer named Tex Kramer
signed an affidavit

39:09.241 --> 39:11.034
swearing
that you sold him heroin.

39:11.137 --> 39:14.620
Didn't happen.
Don't know any Texes or Kramers.

39:14.724 --> 39:16.137
Yeah, I thought so.

39:16.241 --> 39:18.724
Mr. Ward,
did you talk to the warden

39:18.827 --> 39:20.344
about me seeing my boy?

39:20.448 --> 39:23.241
I'll make sure you get
some time with your family.

39:24.241 --> 39:25.517
<i>
Every day</i>

39:25.620 --> 39:27.482
is a choice.

39:27.586 --> 39:29.275
That's the value of living.

39:30.275 --> 39:32.517
Every moment is a decision.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.172
To stay sad or be happy.

39:37.103 --> 39:40.344
To quit or work harder.

39:40.448 --> 39:45.172
To give into temptation
or to do the right thing.

39:47.379 --> 39:51.379
Uh, you used to help the BPD
from time to time. Yeah?

39:51.482 --> 39:54.655
Supplied a few investigations
with important information?

39:54.758 --> 39:57.551
I'm pretty open about my past,
uh, but that part of my life

39:57.655 --> 39:59.896
is something I really
don't like to revisit.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.379
Yeah, understood.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.931
Mr. Kramer, I'm not here
to accuse you of anything.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.551
I-I just want to get
all my facts, you know?

40:06.655 --> 40:10.448
Yeah, well, facts can be
deceptive sometimes.

40:10.551 --> 40:12.344
Are they?

40:12.448 --> 40:14.517
Officers Gary Plunkett
and Randy Knoche,

40:14.620 --> 40:17.827
they caught you doing heroin,
so to beat the charges,

40:17.931 --> 40:21.068
you would feed them information
on drug dealers, yeah?

40:21.931 --> 40:24.551
Ah, our arrangement was uglier.

40:24.655 --> 40:27.275
First time, I went to them.

40:27.379 --> 40:31.965
Gave them a tip on a dealer
in exchange for cash.

40:32.068 --> 40:34.413
After that, they'd come to me.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.758
I got drugs.
They got affidavits.

40:36.862 --> 40:38.482
Affidavits.

40:38.586 --> 40:42.068
Yeah, yeah, affidavits

40:42.172 --> 40:44.620
claiming that you would
buy dope from whoever

40:44.724 --> 40:49.137
Plunkett and Knoche wanted
to arrest, when in reality,

40:49.241 --> 40:51.655
you were actually getting drugs

40:51.758 --> 40:54.758
from those two police officers.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.068
Yeah, uh...

41:04.172 --> 41:05.896
Ugly, like I said.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.931
Do you know how
they got their drugs?

41:08.034 --> 41:10.413
Nope. Didn't ask, didn't care.

41:10.517 --> 41:13.206
Curtis Whitaker.
Does that name ring a bell?

41:13.310 --> 41:15.689
Only from watching the news.

41:15.793 --> 41:19.172
Only from...

41:19.275 --> 41:22.103
'Cause, see,
a key piece of evidence

41:22.206 --> 41:24.448
that the BPD used
to investigate Curtis

41:24.551 --> 41:28.137
was an affidavit
that claimed he was dealing.

41:28.241 --> 41:31.000
That affidavit was
signed by you.

41:31.862 --> 41:33.379
Jesus.

41:35.172 --> 41:37.241
Am I going to jail?

41:38.689 --> 41:40.275
No.

41:40.379 --> 41:43.448
But this is a chance for you
to set the record straight.

41:43.551 --> 41:47.689
By testifying against
Knoche and Plunkett in court?

41:47.793 --> 41:49.724
Possibly, yes.

41:49.827 --> 41:51.724
Those guys don't fuck around.

41:51.827 --> 41:54.206
Well, every day is a choice.

41:55.206 --> 41:57.137
That's the value of living.

42:21.448 --> 42:25.000
Mr. Zanghi, I'm sorry
to drop by unannounced.

42:25.103 --> 42:28.000
- What are you, police?
- FBI. Used to be.

42:28.103 --> 42:30.827
- Reporter?
- Uh, I just wanted to say

42:30.931 --> 42:33.724
how sorry I am for your loss,
about what happened

42:33.827 --> 42:35.413
- to your daughter.
-  Who are you?

42:35.517 --> 42:38.586
Dominique's death, I mean,
that must be devastating.

42:38.689 --> 42:41.931
Beyond devastating, and plus,
you're working s-so hard

42:42.034 --> 42:44.275
to put a bright young mind
through Harvard.

42:44.379 --> 42:46.793
You know, I got a daughter
of my own at NYU,

42:46.896 --> 42:48.655
and that shit ain't cheap.

42:48.758 --> 42:50.482
Every time I cut a check,

42:50.586 --> 42:53.172
it's like I'm passing
a kidney stone.

42:53.275 --> 42:55.137
It's worth the sweat, though.
Right?

42:55.241 --> 42:57.620
So that's why I just
wanted to, you know,

42:57.724 --> 43:00.482
come by-- parent to parent--
just to see if there was

43:00.586 --> 43:03.379
anything that I could do
to-to get to the bottom of this

43:03.482 --> 43:06.241
and just find out
what happened to Dominique.

43:07.068 --> 43:08.379
With all the drugs
Dom was taking,

43:08.482 --> 43:10.000
something bad
was bound to happen.

43:10.103 --> 43:11.965
- Annabella.
- What? Truth is the truth.

43:12.068 --> 43:15.965
She was addicted to anything
in particular, like quaaludes?

43:16.068 --> 43:17.965
Quaaludes? Nah.

43:18.068 --> 43:19.655
Just the codeine.

43:19.758 --> 43:21.793
Codeine. Oh.

43:21.896 --> 43:26.172
Did you speak to Dominique
the night she died?

43:27.275 --> 43:28.793
What about before that?

43:28.896 --> 43:31.034
Was she intimate with anybody,
as far as you know?

43:31.137 --> 43:32.862
- Listen, Mister...
- Rohr.

43:32.965 --> 43:35.827
Mr. Rohr, Dom is dead.

43:35.931 --> 43:39.517
And there's nothing
we can do or you can do

43:39.620 --> 43:41.448
- that's gonna bring her back.
- Yeah, but I just thought

43:41.551 --> 43:46.310
that knowing the circumstances
might help you rest easier.

43:46.413 --> 43:49.862
Well, we're in negotiation.
Our lawyer says not to talk.

43:49.965 --> 43:52.137
Negotiation with who?

43:52.241 --> 43:56.068
I just told you,
I can't say shit.

44:03.103 --> 44:06.965
What kind of limp-dick
son of a bitch are you, Carlo?

44:07.068 --> 44:10.482
You know? My daughter O.D.'d.

44:10.586 --> 44:13.896
I almost lost her, and I wanted
to kill everybody in sight,

44:14.000 --> 44:17.931
and all you can fucking say is,
"We're in negotiation"?

44:18.034 --> 44:19.793
You know what? Fuck you.

44:19.896 --> 44:22.103
Fuck both of you.

44:43.103 --> 44:45.068
- Hello?
-  <i>Bendrops.</i>

44:45.172 --> 44:47.000
Hi, Dad.

44:47.103 --> 44:50.344
Hey. It's kind of loud.

44:50.448 --> 44:52.758
Yeah, having a party.
Couple of us girls.

44:52.862 --> 44:54.206
A party?

44:54.310 --> 44:55.517
In the middle of the day?

44:55.620 --> 44:57.034
Did you need something, Dad?

44:57.137 --> 44:58.862
No, no, I-I just...

44:58.965 --> 45:01.379
No, I was just calling to s...

45:01.482 --> 45:04.620
just to say, you know,
just be safe.

45:04.724 --> 45:07.034
Just be fucking safe.
That's all.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.862
Just k-keep an eye on your drink

45:08.965 --> 45:11.275
and-and don't trust nobody,
not even Faust.

45:11.379 --> 45:13.482
You know,
'cause sometimes the people

45:13.586 --> 45:16.310
that you think love you don't.

45:16.413 --> 45:18.413
Oh, we're just having fun, Dad.

45:18.517 --> 45:20.344
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
F-Fun is good.

45:20.448 --> 45:25.344
But-but if-if I have to come
down to New York, I will.

45:25.448 --> 45:27.068
All right? I fucking will.

45:27.172 --> 45:28.896
<i>I won't hesitate.</i>

45:29.000 --> 45:30.586
Look, I'm not drinking, Dad.

45:30.689 --> 45:33.551
And you shouldn't be drunk
this early in the day.

45:33.655 --> 45:35.724
- What? No, I-I'm not...

45:40.068 --> 45:41.620
...drunk.

45:47.275 --> 45:49.586
<i>Though Jackie's not
in the FBI these days,</i>

45:49.689 --> 45:52.517
I'm still in touch
with a couple of the wives.

45:52.620 --> 45:55.379
Me being here
might not be appropriate.

45:55.482 --> 45:58.000
And if he found out,
Jackie would pop a vein.

45:58.103 --> 46:00.758
But I'm-I'm just...
I'm hoping, you know,

46:00.862 --> 46:03.482
maybe you can point me
in the right direction.

46:03.586 --> 46:08.034
Uh, those OPR people made
a mistake pushing him out.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.862
Jackie's a good man.

46:15.137 --> 46:17.413
He's good at his job, anyway.

46:18.793 --> 46:20.827
You must be a patient person.

46:20.931 --> 46:23.517
Guess so, yeah.

46:23.620 --> 46:25.241
I'm not.

46:25.344 --> 46:26.724
I don't blame you for attempting

46:26.827 --> 46:29.137
to get your husband
back into the Bureau,

46:29.241 --> 46:31.620
but he doesn't deserve
to work there.

46:31.724 --> 46:34.482
He's corrupt,

46:34.586 --> 46:38.448
among many other
unsavory traits.

46:38.551 --> 46:41.931
Sure. Yeah, yeah, I...

46:42.034 --> 46:44.655
I mean, Jackie can be a...

46:46.448 --> 46:47.793
...a dickhead.

46:48.620 --> 46:51.137
But I know how he treats
the things

46:51.241 --> 46:54.206
that he cares about most.

46:54.310 --> 46:56.586
Uh, he's a protector.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.482
I mean, he would
lay down in the middle

46:58.586 --> 47:01.241
of traffic on Boylston
for our daughter Benny.

47:01.344 --> 47:02.965
And his job is a part of him.

47:03.068 --> 47:04.620
And no part of me wants to see

47:04.724 --> 47:07.655
that egocentric degenerate reinstated.

47:08.551 --> 47:12.137
In fact, I helped
get rid of him.

47:16.068 --> 47:17.793
Yeah.

47:17.896 --> 47:20.482
I was kind of
picking up on that.

47:22.379 --> 47:23.965
Okay.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.034
You... I can see
why you rattle Jackie.

47:28.137 --> 47:31.965
I mean, you're smart.

47:32.068 --> 47:33.896
Strong.

47:35.620 --> 47:38.000
I kind of wish I scared him
the way you do.

47:41.448 --> 47:43.344
Mrs. Rohr.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.551
You seem like a nice person,
so I'll say this.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.689
If you want to get
Jackie reinstated,

47:51.793 --> 47:54.689
you'll need to find a lawyer,
and that lawyer will tell you

47:54.793 --> 47:58.137
to go after
Holly Gunner's reputation.

47:58.241 --> 48:00.965
At which point you'll have
a decision to make.

48:01.068 --> 48:05.137
Do you want to ruin
another woman's life?

48:05.241 --> 48:06.724
A life your husband

48:06.827 --> 48:09.965
has already done
so much damage to?

48:21.137 --> 48:22.896
Siobhan Quays.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.689
Do I know you?

48:24.793 --> 48:26.620
You don't.

48:26.724 --> 48:28.551
I just stopped by
to recommend you stay away

48:28.655 --> 48:30.379
from the construction site,
all right?

48:30.482 --> 48:31.896
No, that's not all right.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.241
What happened to Hernando
Mendoza is a damn shame.

48:35.344 --> 48:38.413
But an accident is an accident.

48:38.517 --> 48:39.586
Unless it's not.

48:39.689 --> 48:41.724
Are you trying to frighten me?

48:41.827 --> 48:43.379
Oh, there's no chance of that.

48:43.482 --> 48:45.862
Big bad Black lady
stomping around town,

48:45.965 --> 48:48.586
handing out your cards,
demanding reports,

48:48.689 --> 48:51.344
asking about this and that.

48:51.448 --> 48:53.827
- Just working for my client.
- Hey.

48:53.931 --> 48:57.103
Didn't you get shot
a few months ago?

48:57.206 --> 49:00.896
I'd be extra careful
after an experience like that.

49:11.551 --> 49:13.551
How deeply involved

49:13.655 --> 49:15.724
is the mob
in the construction union?

49:17.413 --> 49:19.206
Oh, I mean,
nothing's been proven,

49:19.310 --> 49:23.068
but I'd say, right now,
they're one and the same.

49:23.172 --> 49:25.000
Why do you ask?

49:26.310 --> 49:29.758
Mm, just trying
to connect some dots.

49:31.551 --> 49:33.724
How's Whitaker coming along?

49:33.827 --> 49:36.103
You know, I think
I got a solid lead.

49:36.206 --> 49:38.689
I'll know some more tomorrow.

49:40.482 --> 49:43.275
Hey.

49:43.379 --> 49:45.448
Come here, come here, come here.

49:49.172 --> 49:50.620
I got something for you.

49:50.724 --> 49:53.103
- A present?
- Yeah, it's...

49:53.206 --> 49:55.517
it's a gift for both of us.

49:55.620 --> 49:57.862
And neither of us.

49:57.965 --> 50:00.965
I bought it with my dad's
insurance check.

50:01.068 --> 50:03.586
You know, I felt weird just
putting the money in the bank

50:03.689 --> 50:05.586
or using it to pay gym fees.

50:05.689 --> 50:06.931
- You know.
- Mm-hmm.

50:07.034 --> 50:09.482
I wanted to do
something meaningful.

50:09.586 --> 50:12.793
Something in his name
so that Franklin Ward

50:12.896 --> 50:15.793
is a part of our past
and our future.

50:15.896 --> 50:17.862
Mm.

50:23.379 --> 50:25.965
Hmm.

50:26.068 --> 50:28.172
This...

50:28.275 --> 50:30.827
It's-it's for our kid.

50:30.931 --> 50:34.482
For-for when they turn 18 or-or
graduate college, you know.

50:34.586 --> 50:36.655
And from their grandpa,
you know?

50:36.758 --> 50:39.620
A man who was on time
when he was early

50:39.724 --> 50:42.344
- and late when he was on time.

50:42.448 --> 50:44.000
That's beautiful, but--

50:44.103 --> 50:47.655
Yeah, I-I know, we're not
planning on having a kid soon.

50:47.758 --> 50:50.551
This is not me pressuring you.

50:50.655 --> 50:52.517
Just, you know, when we do,

50:52.620 --> 50:54.551
I figured that...

50:54.655 --> 50:57.517
it-it could bring
Dad back to us.

50:58.379 --> 51:00.068
It's a lovely idea.

51:00.172 --> 51:02.931
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

51:03.034 --> 51:04.275
Hey.

51:04.379 --> 51:07.379
This is a man's watch.

51:07.482 --> 51:10.517
So I'm guessing, when that time
comes, it needs to be a boy?

51:10.620 --> 51:12.000
What? No, baby.

51:12.103 --> 51:14.310
No, I-I told you,
if we have a girl...

51:14.413 --> 51:15.896
- Mm.
- ...that'd be amazing.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.586
- Mm.
- And we'll just keep trying

51:18.689 --> 51:19.758
till we get it right.

51:19.862 --> 51:22.068
-'Cause...

51:22.172 --> 51:23.965
Oh, you...
putting your dukes up?

51:24.068 --> 51:26.000
- A'ight. Hey, hey.

51:26.103 --> 51:28.413
-  Hello?

51:28.517 --> 51:30.103
In here, Chris.

51:30.206 --> 51:33.586
- Where are the kids?
- My parents.

51:36.724 --> 51:38.931
You know, being in the courtroom

51:39.034 --> 51:42.068
and listening
to the testimony and...

51:42.172 --> 51:46.724
hearing Suferin
just scream at you...

51:46.827 --> 51:50.724
I got this chill down my back.

51:51.827 --> 51:53.275
And it's the same chill I had

51:53.379 --> 51:55.827
standing with Carol Wallace
in the morgue

51:55.931 --> 51:58.655
while she identified
her dead husband.

51:59.586 --> 52:02.103
I never told you,

52:02.206 --> 52:05.965
but I saw the hole
in the back of Russ's head.

52:06.068 --> 52:09.586
And I don't ever want to be
anywhere near that morgue again.

52:09.689 --> 52:11.344
All right, Maggie,
I know how you feel.

52:11.448 --> 52:12.862
You saying that, Chris,

52:12.965 --> 52:15.620
means you have
no fucking idea how I feel.

52:15.724 --> 52:18.000
Sometimes you're gone for days.

52:18.103 --> 52:20.620
I don't know where you are,
and I panic.

52:20.724 --> 52:24.206
And then the phone rings,
and I jump.

52:24.310 --> 52:26.482
And you're on the line,
all calm and cool,

52:26.586 --> 52:29.034
asking for a clean pair
of jeans.

52:34.275 --> 52:35.965
I screw up sometimes.

52:36.068 --> 52:38.517
I'm sorry.

52:38.620 --> 52:41.172
But we've always
worked this stuff out.

52:41.275 --> 52:45.724
Right? W-We've always
found a way to...

52:45.827 --> 52:48.275
- give each other a little grace.
- No, wrong.

52:48.379 --> 52:50.310
You get the grace.

52:50.413 --> 52:53.172
And I get the worry.

52:54.931 --> 53:00.137
Baby, we used to be so happy.

53:02.241 --> 53:04.103
And now...

53:05.896 --> 53:08.689
I'm just sad...

53:08.793 --> 53:11.827
all the time, and...

53:11.931 --> 53:14.172
and I hate you for it.

53:16.931 --> 53:18.551
But I swear to Christ,

53:18.655 --> 53:21.965
I am not gonna stare at a hole
in the back of your head.

53:22.068 --> 53:24.379
What do you...
what do you want me to do?

53:24.482 --> 53:26.827
Quit. Stop being a cop.

53:26.931 --> 53:28.241
What-what am I gonna fucking do?

53:28.344 --> 53:30.344
Work for my dad.
Be a dog walker. I don't care.

53:30.448 --> 53:31.862
Just fucking quit.

53:31.965 --> 53:34.448
I can't.

53:34.551 --> 53:36.482
You-you know I can't.

53:36.586 --> 53:39.241
Yeah, I do know that.

53:39.344 --> 53:40.793
I do.

53:40.896 --> 53:44.379
Which is why I'm leaving.

53:44.482 --> 53:45.517
What? Leaving? What?

53:45.620 --> 53:47.620
Wait, for how long?

53:47.724 --> 53:49.310
The kids and I will be

53:49.413 --> 53:51.965
at my parents' place
if you need to reach us.

53:52.793 --> 53:55.379
Maggie, wait. Ju...

53:55.482 --> 53:56.931
Stay here with the twins.

53:57.034 --> 54:00.310
Just t-take the house,
t-take as much time as you need.

54:00.413 --> 54:02.241
I-I just...

54:02.344 --> 54:04.241
I'll go. I'll go.

54:04.344 --> 54:07.206
You've always loved this place
more than me.

54:07.310 --> 54:08.793
You stay.

55:29.206 --> 55:31.068
