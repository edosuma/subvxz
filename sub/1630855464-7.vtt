WEBVTT

01:31.592 --> 01:33.719
And down it goes.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.263
It's slicing us, virtually.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.435
Just in case one of us commits suicide
by means of boredom.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.315
If that were possible,
would any of us still draw breath?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.570
We failed the Prophet.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.074
I'm not sure about that.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.372
We were told to go to the Imperial Palace
and look where we are,

02:02.372 --> 02:04.541
- the Imperial Palace.
- Yeah.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.668
And this must be the diplomatic lounge.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.670
Thank you for not laughing

02:09.670 --> 02:12.257
when I was prattling on about the wine
from the Prophet's hand.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.469
It took me over a century
to find a way to be useful to him

02:15.469 --> 02:17.179
and less than a week to fuck it up.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.473
I should have kept the Vordaline.

02:20.182 --> 02:23.060
We flagged them at the port
and brought them in this morning.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.979
They claim to have traveled here
for diplomatic relations.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
What are those robes?

02:27.397 --> 02:30.984
Clerical vestments. Church of Hari Seldon.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.571
Just as General Riose arrives
in the Outer Reach,

02:34.571 --> 02:37.115
the Outer Reach reaches out.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.159
Interesting.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.620
You'll want to see the data
from the port of entry.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.419
Given the timing,
should we continue with preparations

02:49.419 --> 02:51.380
for your marriage to Queen Sareth?

02:57.261 --> 03:00.264
Unless you're having second thoughts?

03:00.931 --> 03:04.852
There'll be no turning back if I do this.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.534
It will be different for both of us, but...

03:23.370 --> 03:25.581
you will always have a place here, Demerzel.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.083
With my new family.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.128
My children...

03:33.172 --> 03:35.299
even if they somehow don't resemble me.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.052
They will be Empire, just the same.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.097
Of course.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.740
<i>I thank Empire for his words of welcome.</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:02.618
<i>I look forward to ruling at his side.</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:05.954
<i>And I want you, all of you...</i>

04:06.455 --> 04:08.707
The way he set his jaw when I spoke.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.958
<i>...I am not wed to just one...</i>

04:09.958 --> 04:13.086
He hid it well for the crowd,
but up close, it was something to behold.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.339
There's this little vein, right here,
that--

04:18.800 --> 04:21.553
Why do I feel as though my enjoiner
is about to live up to the title?

04:21.553 --> 04:24.223
No admonishments, just advice.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.767
You make them feel so similar.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.979
Day is taken with you. Perhaps because you
treat him with contempt.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.650
And foolishly,
he's not particularly threatened by you.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.694
But there's one thing you must never do
to a man like that.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.322
You must never embarrass him.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.782
You know I'll be careful, but--

04:44.159 --> 04:45.994
Queen Sareth-betrothed.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.289
You were the cynosure of all eyes today.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.835
People of Trantor appear quite taken
with your promises.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.044
Thank you.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.048
But you come
with more than congratulations, surely?

04:58.799 --> 05:03.095
Now that your wedding's been announced,
our doctors request your presence.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.140
A final examination
before we begin producing an heir.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.433
We can find time this week.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.979
You misunderstand me.
I'm here to escort the queen now.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.454
I know, Demerzel. I know what you are.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.833
Your mechanical nature.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.669
I need to be read into the family secrets.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.255
I won't live at a disadvantage.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.341
You are well-informed.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.468
I am a humaniform robot.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.472
I had a governess
who told tales of the great pogrom.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.934
She said you'd all been destroyed.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.813
Are there any other survivors?

05:59.151 --> 06:00.944
To my knowledge, I am the last one.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.907
I have served the dynasty
since the reign of Cleon I.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.785
Did you serve any other masters
before him?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.370
Not directly.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.290
What does that mean?

06:16.251 --> 06:20.297
For a long time,
all robots were bound by three laws.

06:20.881 --> 06:25.886
The laws made me unable to harm a human
or allow harm to come to a human.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.680
- And now?
- Now I'm bound by only one law.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.265
- Which is?
- I serve Empire.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.975
And I'll soon be an empress.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.228
Hence my line of questioning.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.564
When the time comes, I want to know.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.526
Will you serve me?

06:42.444 --> 06:44.029
I will serve Empire.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.051
Thank you all for your interest.

07:06.552 --> 07:09.096
I am Oran, physician of the court.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.475
I specialize in matters of reproduction
and suchlike.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.896
Please, try to relax.

07:20.315 --> 07:24.736
We will begin
with a simple uterine examination

07:25.779 --> 07:29.741
to ensure you're capable
of carrying Empire's progeny.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.036
I'm sure my womb is strong enough
to carry the Cleon-Child,

07:33.662 --> 07:35.330
fabled though its kicks may be.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.333
Yes. I'm quite sure that it is.

07:42.588 --> 07:47.593
I see the queen has chemically stimulated
the royal ovaries as we requested.

07:51.263 --> 07:54.308
Once this is finished, you'll be sedated
so we can harvest the eggs.

07:54.308 --> 07:57.436
You're not harvesting anything
until Empire and I are legally bound.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.314
- Call me old-fashioned.
- You're in no position to argue.

08:00.314 --> 08:03.734
Is that a joke, Demerzel?
I can argue in any position.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.738
The moment you accepted Empire's proposal,
your womb became imperial property.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.033
And you would know all about being
imperial property, wouldn't you?

08:11.825 --> 08:16.163
Cloud Dominion has equal interest
in the queen's offspring.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.542
So we can enjoin in any premature
harvesting. But in good time.

08:20.542 --> 08:24.671
Yes, exactly. After the wedding,
I'll produce eggs by the dozen.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.927
And you don't need to worry
about the process either, Demerzel.

08:29.927 --> 08:34.139
I know you have an arrangement
with my husband-to-be,

08:34.806 --> 08:35.933
and I won't get in the way.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.477
You and Day wish to continue playing
sanctum and scepter,

08:38.477 --> 08:41.230
I'm happy to carry his children
and let you do the drudge work.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.774
This must be done during ovulation.

08:45.651 --> 08:46.902
We'll stop here for now.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.613
We have many years ahead of us.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.865
Wonderful!

08:54.952 --> 08:58.205
I hope whatever you must do
to Day to reverse the imperial sterility

08:58.205 --> 08:59.665
is as painful as this.

08:59.665 --> 09:03.293
Yes, well,
Empire's reversal is a simple procedure.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.754
It takes about 20 seconds
for the nano-probes

09:05.754 --> 09:07.840
to tunnel new vasa deferentia.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.093
At least that sounds unpleasant.
Fair is fair.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.764
All right, Dr. Oran. I think you've
rummaged around enough for today.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.061
- We'll stop here for now.
- Yes.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.772
I'd like to have a moment alone
with the queen.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.109
It's all right.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.539
You believe Empire killed your family.

09:41.123 --> 09:44.543
I know you have come here
with that in mind. So, just to say it,

09:44.543 --> 09:49.673
if ever you should entertain some fantasy
of revenge, please think of them.

09:50.382 --> 09:56.138
Your parents. Your siblings.
Burnt alive by the very air around them.

09:56.138 --> 10:00.309
Killed with the sort of precision
I bring to my work.

10:26.668 --> 10:32.633
86,988,301, 86,988,329...

10:32.633 --> 10:33.634
Gaal?

10:36.220 --> 10:37.054
Salvor?

10:38.597 --> 10:39.890
Something Tellem taught you?

10:40.807 --> 10:41.683
I'm sorry. I just--

10:42.267 --> 10:43.435
What is going on with you?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.939
Hey, you can't just disappear.
We need to talk about this.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.315
Hari took my fucking ship.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.692
He had to. The people here will accept us,
but never him.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.111
You know,
I don't wanna be accepted by them.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.782
We need to leave.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.492
Tellem's got a few little ships.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.952
We lift one, sub-light.
It'll get us somewhere.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.204
We're not leaving. We need these people.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.082
For The Mule, right?

11:07.251 --> 11:08.252
Not for any other reason.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.673
You keep acting like The Mule
is some abstract thing.

11:12.673 --> 11:16.552
He isn't. I felt him in my head,
and I saw your dead body.

11:16.552 --> 11:20.806
So now you're willing to bank
our whole future on Tellem.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.559
You need to bury those thoughts.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.270
Why? What are you thinking
that you don't want them to know?

11:28.313 --> 11:32.651
You know, I've been hearing a lot
about openness since we got here.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.405
Back on Terminus,
I could read people up and down.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.740
But here? Nothing.

11:40.075 --> 11:44.037
I can't read Tellem. I can't read anyone.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.707
Something is wrong with this place.

11:46.707 --> 11:50.544
You're angry with each other.
You'll feel happier once you've eaten.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.713
Eating always makes me feel happier.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.299
- After we eat what?
- There's a feast.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.033
Morning.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.912
It's always a big day for us
when we take on someone new.

12:26.121 --> 12:30.876
I'm sorry about that business with Hari.
Him leaving.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.338
- Yeah, me too.
- We will find equilibrium.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.173
This I promise.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.885
In the meantime, there's work to be done.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.638
I know my way around a fishing net.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.571
Salvor.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.454
Is that our breakfast?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.580
Uh-huh.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.582
Ghost mollusks.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.168
Great source of protein,

13:13.752 --> 13:16.213
but these fuckers live so far down.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.715
We're at the mercy of the current.

13:19.216 --> 13:23.303
But you wait long enough,
you got yourself a feast.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.764
So this really is a rare occasion.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.976
We don't tread lightly on good tidings.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.980
Tellem's excited you're here.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.401
Tellem is excited Gaal's here.

13:37.401 --> 13:41.697
Your talents are just as important.
I felt them when we...

13:43.198 --> 13:45.200
- Kissed?
- Touched.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.453
That's all it takes.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.833
- And the kiss was your doing.
- It didn't seem to bother you.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.878
What kind of illusion would it have been
if I pulled away?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.590
I'm sorry.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.592
Seriously, I'm sorry.

14:02.968 --> 14:06.138
Sometimes other faces come
a little too easily for me. You know?

14:07.264 --> 14:09.391
Looks like someone
didn't appreciate your gift.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.268
People back home saw a monster.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.145
So they made me one.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.940
Before I got here, anywhere I went,

14:16.940 --> 14:19.943
I could feel the way people flinched
when they saw me coming.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.404
Did I?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.073
A little bit.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.123
But trust me,

14:34.583 --> 14:37.461
you'll end up closer to the people here
than anywhere you've ever been.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.631
That's what's so great about this place.
No one can hide.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.817
Right. I'm starving. Come on.

15:16.542 --> 15:17.376
Good.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.338
- Yeah. I've got it.
- Flip it over.

15:31.056 --> 15:31.974
What is that?

15:34.268 --> 15:35.644
Do you feel something?

15:35.644 --> 15:38.146
Pain. It's like they're screaming.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.649
Well, you would too,
if you were boiled alive.

15:40.649 --> 15:44.319
I mean, we talk about being Sighted,
but language is imprecise.

15:44.319 --> 15:48.240
All of the senses are involved,
hearing too. General empathy.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.575
I've never felt anything like--

15:49.575 --> 15:51.410
Well, you are broadening, child.

15:51.410 --> 15:55.539
And here, you're among your own.
We're stronger when there's harmony.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.210
Maybe we'll stick to the leaves.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.629
Why? Plants feel pain.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.717
Trees send chemical signals through
their roots when they're distressed.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.510
What's that, if not a scream?

16:09.011 --> 16:11.263
Suffering is the price of admission.

16:12.014 --> 16:16.393
Humanity pretends otherwise, but their
ability to ignore the suffering of others

16:16.393 --> 16:21.440
leaves room for excess,
indulgence, conquest.

16:23.025 --> 16:27.279
The man who owned all of this,
Emperor Kandar,

16:28.238 --> 16:32.034
he loved to bathe in a violet pigment
extracted from these mollusks.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.119
That's why there's so few left.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.458
He died of overabundance,
young and purple.

16:41.585 --> 16:47.925
We're different. We don't shy away
from the pain we cause. We honor it.

16:47.925 --> 16:52.221
If you feel everything,
you don't take more than you need.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.015
Lose your appetite?

16:55.849 --> 16:59.144
I'm just trying to wrap my head around
the fact that everything I eat,

16:59.144 --> 17:01.522
from now on, is going to be yelling
at me the whole way down.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.899
Small price to pay for truth.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.944
This mean I'm finally Sighted?

17:06.944 --> 17:09.863
Well, there's a few more steps,
but you're no longer blind.

17:10.364 --> 17:12.950
- So, I'm squinting.
- Like a newborn.

17:18.955 --> 17:23.502
Hey there. You know, believe it
or not, I was just looking for you guys.

17:23.502 --> 17:25.628
This place is amazing.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.422
We jump-randomize.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.259
Only another Spacer would know
where we would appear.

17:30.259 --> 17:33.178
- What have you done?
- No-- Wait.

17:33.178 --> 17:36.598
Look, I was given these coordinates
by a man named Hari Seldon.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.142
He's a good predictor.
It's kinda what he does.

17:39.142 --> 17:44.439
We close-guard our movements.
No one can know and continue to live.

17:46.024 --> 17:51.613
- Space will kill you quickly.
- No. I have something for you.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.954
- Opalesk.
- Yeah.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.456
You can keep that.
Breathe it, eat it, whatever you want.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.585
The Foundation makes it
and can make more of it.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.587
Opalesk synthesizing is impossible.

18:06.587 --> 18:11.216
And yet, Seldon's happy little scientists
found a way.

18:11.216 --> 18:15.095
Look, your modifications have left you
dependent on this stuff,

18:15.095 --> 18:16.597
this micronutrient.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.099
And I don't know
if Empire did that to you,

18:19.099 --> 18:20.934
but I know they've taken advantage of it.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.438
This is the dam they use to hold you in.
How many of your children do they take?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.524
Ten percent of our offspring navigate
for them.

18:27.524 --> 18:31.069
Right. Or you don't get the opalesk.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.947
And they tell you
that means the rest of you are free.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.325
You're not free.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.119
They could choke the supply any day

18:39.119 --> 18:42.206
if the Cleon in the middle chair decides
he doesn't need you anymore.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.665
But he does need us.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.960
You looked at my ship? Scan it.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.008
See what it doesn't need?

18:53.008 --> 18:54.718
Spacer navigators.

18:54.718 --> 18:58.013
What do you think happens
when Empire gets tech like that?

18:58.013 --> 19:00.516
You think they're gonna bother
sending you your vitamins then?

19:02.768 --> 19:04.561
You want us to work together.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.190
And our pay would be opalesk?

19:08.190 --> 19:12.194
Your pay would be opalesk,
but your reward would be freedom.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.782
Keeping your daughters and sons,
and the offspring of the whole swarm.

19:16.782 --> 19:20.285
Living for yourselves.
Can you even imagine it,

19:20.285 --> 19:24.748
if the dam broke, and you could just
flow out into the ocean of the universe?

19:24.748 --> 19:27.751
We were built to flow outward, as you say.

19:28.293 --> 19:33.215
To flow beyond the galaxy,
into the ocean of the universe.

19:33.215 --> 19:37.135
Right. And that freedom can be yours.

19:37.135 --> 19:41.431
All you need to do is help us
kick Empire in the nuts.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.605
<i>For anyone who needs it spelled out,</i>

19:49.857 --> 19:52.109
<i>I am ending the Genetic Dynasty.</i>

19:58.282 --> 20:00.784
- I was watching that.
- Yeah, well, too bad.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.662
He thinks he can change.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.456
He's located a desire to procreate.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.750
I'm not overwhelmed with admiration.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.461
Come.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.424
General, sorry for the intrusion.

20:15.424 --> 20:18.927
She-Bends has reviewed the footage
from Siwenna and would like a word.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.849
I've never witnessed
a singularity-fold that small.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.601
A ship with a mind of its own.

20:25.601 --> 20:28.979
Our contact on Siwenna thought
it was some kind of organic computing.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.607
Is it possible that the Foundation
are powering their ships

20:31.607 --> 20:34.026
by growing brain tissue without a host?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.823
- What are you doing?
- Is she okay?

20:41.074 --> 20:45.996
What is going on now?
Is this how you, like, sign the deal?

20:45.996 --> 20:50.083
The opalesk is tempting,
but the risk is too great.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.752
You are correct.

20:51.752 --> 20:55.214
Ten percent of our offspring
is tithed to the Imperium.

20:56.381 --> 21:01.220
But if Empire learns we have exchanged
words with you, they will demand 20.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.388
We cannot bear that.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.227
I've been sent a message
by the Home-Swarm.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.439
The whisper-ship you are seeking
is currently in Spacer custody.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.526
- Didn't know you could do that.
- Let's set course to intercept.

21:15.526 --> 21:18.403
No. The Home-Swarm are coming to us.

21:46.974 --> 21:51.311
Gaal? What's The Mule?
You keep thinking it.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.534
The Mule is a conqueror,
and we're a threat to him.

22:05.534 --> 22:08.203
152 years from now, he finds us.

22:09.288 --> 22:10.622
How do you know that?

22:11.456 --> 22:14.585
She sees forward,
to what will be but isn't yet.

22:17.588 --> 22:21.175
I wanna tell you something. All of you.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.636
You met Hari Seldon,
who came here with us.

22:25.220 --> 22:30.475
A long time ago, he devised a way
to use mathematics to predict the future.

22:31.393 --> 22:36.273
It was so accurate,
it was almost like magic.

22:38.901 --> 22:42.196
But then,
he discovered there were outliers.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.823
People who could upset the math.

22:44.823 --> 22:45.908
Like The Mule.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.285
And like us.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.590
I was never like my people.

23:03.091 --> 23:09.264
I was lonely, and even when I was
very young, I thought in numbers.

23:10.432 --> 23:14.269
<i>It was dangerous to think that way
on my world, but I didn't stop.</i>

23:15.354 --> 23:19.942
Numbers warmed me in the cold.
They lit my way in the dark.

23:21.068 --> 23:25.197
And then one day,
they carried me out into the galaxy.

23:25.989 --> 23:32.120
<i>And now I think all that time,
my mind was counting and counting,</i>

23:32.120 --> 23:35.541
<i>all to understand a power I was born with.</i>

23:36.875 --> 23:38.544
Hari predicted darkness.

23:39.044 --> 23:42.631
The Empire crumbling
and taking everything with it.

23:43.715 --> 23:47.469
I think that's why so many of you
found each other recently.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.890
There aren't suddenly more of us.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.269
There's just so much more suffering now.

23:56.103 --> 24:01.316
The screams are so much louder.
It's like your mollusks, boiling.

24:02.109 --> 24:05.112
We need to nudge
and mend things where we can

24:05.112 --> 24:09.241
so that whatever replaces Empire
isn't worse.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.787
You've been mistreated.
There's nothing you owe.

24:13.787 --> 24:19.293
But if we stop hiding,
then more Sighteds will be drawn out.

24:19.293 --> 24:23.547
And by the time The Mule comes for us,
we will be ready.

24:24.548 --> 24:28.135
All it requires is foresight and planning.

24:29.845 --> 24:31.263
It requires belief.

25:18.268 --> 25:24.024
General, we offer up Hober Mallow,
who attempted to broker our betrayal.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.610
I appreciate you coming in person,
She-Is-Center.

25:26.610 --> 25:28.153
I came in self-interest.

25:28.779 --> 25:30.906
My daughter was tithe-given to your ship.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.243
I wanted to see her.

25:35.327 --> 25:37.329
And I am the brighter for it.

25:53.053 --> 25:55.556
We've been looking for a ship
that was seen on Siwenna.

25:58.684 --> 26:02.896
And here it is, with you at the controls.
Who are you?

26:02.896 --> 26:04.022
Good question.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.692
Yeah, should we discuss that now--

26:19.288 --> 26:23.125
Why don't you save your ribs?
You're an agent of the Foundation.

26:23.667 --> 26:24.668
How do their ships work?

26:26.336 --> 26:29.798
I'm a bit out of breath.
I've been selling hard and--

26:32.718 --> 26:35.387
Okay, fine. Fine.

26:35.387 --> 26:38.891
You want the ship,
here's your blasted ship.

26:42.519 --> 26:43.896
It's not even mine.

26:45.189 --> 26:47.608
There is one thing you should know
about whisper-ships.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.902
They come
with a very robust security system.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.281
Fuck.

27:07.836 --> 27:10.506
Good girl, Beki. Come on.

27:17.304 --> 27:18.514
Shit.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.279
Let's see what this baby can do.

27:39.368 --> 27:41.370
- He's gonna jump.
- He cannot escape.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.455
There's not enough room to execute a jump.

27:43.956 --> 27:46.124
It's suicide.
He'll take half the swarm with him.

28:00.264 --> 28:03.141
<i>His ship jumped
within the confines of the hangar.</i>

28:04.142 --> 28:06.019
The Magicians have learned a new trick.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.064
<i>Foundation technology
has outpaced our own.</i>

28:09.731 --> 28:11.149
<i>Their whisper-ships are more nimble</i>

28:11.149 --> 28:13.777
<i>and they can navigate
without the aid of Spacers.</i>

28:14.319 --> 28:15.320
<i>There's more.</i>

28:16.530 --> 28:19.283
Seldon sent Mallow
to meet with the Spacers

28:19.283 --> 28:21.827
and tempt them with promises of freedom.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.913
He hails from Smyrno,
which the Foundation now claims,

28:24.913 --> 28:27.124
so we can assume that he acts
in their name.

28:27.124 --> 28:29.918
<i>You're saying the Spacers
have broken faith with Empire?</i>

28:29.918 --> 28:32.796
No. But the fact
that Terminus even attempted it

28:32.796 --> 28:35.841
suggests the Foundation is preparing
for war.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.593
Could they have hired the Blind Angels?

28:37.593 --> 28:40.929
Are they capable of assassination?

28:42.055 --> 28:43.432
That is our problem.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.351
We do not know what they are capable of.

28:46.351 --> 28:47.853
<i>What are my orders, Empire?</i>

28:48.812 --> 28:51.481
<i>Shall I stand by for deployment--</i>

28:53.317 --> 28:54.318
Fuck.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.410
Can you tell what he wants?

29:04.703 --> 29:06.997
Well, I fear he wants to impress me.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.376
We have to do something, Bel.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.879
- Don't, Sailor.
- No, don't you try and pull rank.

29:13.879 --> 29:15.672
You were able to stand up to him once.

29:15.672 --> 29:18.634
You disobeyed an order,
and now we should blindly obey?

29:18.634 --> 29:22.262
The order I refused
would've got sailors killed.

29:22.262 --> 29:23.472
People I command.

29:23.472 --> 29:26.308
- And civilians makes it better?
- Fuck you, Glawen.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.395
You know what he'd do if I refused
another order?

29:31.522 --> 29:33.732
- He'd kill you.
- No.

29:34.316 --> 29:35.484
He'd kill you.

29:36.151 --> 29:39.404
He'd put me in a naked cell
for a couple of decades,

29:39.404 --> 29:42.783
watching a holo of your death that
they'd rig up to play inside my eyelids.

29:42.783 --> 29:45.369
And someone else will carry
out the fucking orders anyway.

29:58.924 --> 30:03.011
Let's say I put word out
that I've got something top secret.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.181
I get close to him. I get around the aura

30:06.181 --> 30:08.892
and the million other defenses
we know nothing about, and I kill the man.

30:08.892 --> 30:11.103
They decant another,
load him up with all the same old shit,

30:11.103 --> 30:13.397
- and we're back to where we started.
- But, Bel, if you're go to--

30:13.397 --> 30:16.984
Or I go bigger. I take the fleet
and we blow up the palace from orbit.

30:16.984 --> 30:18.610
Now they decant three new ones.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.612
Well, not if we blow up
the three new ones as well.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.156
If they really are ending
the Genetic Dynasty, Bel--

30:23.156 --> 30:24.867
Okay. Let's say we take down Empire.

30:24.867 --> 30:25.993
What does that look like?

30:26.702 --> 30:30.455
Ducem Barr said Foundation is strong.
It could take over.

30:30.455 --> 30:34.501
Look, there is no way that they're ready.
You know how big Imperium is.

30:34.501 --> 30:37.504
Let me tell you what it looks like
if Empire falls.

30:37.504 --> 30:42.176
'Cause I've seen regions of space
that have fallen into lawlessness.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.682
The weak... are objects.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.687
Fuck. The rapists are kings.

30:56.481 --> 30:57.482
The poor...

31:00.152 --> 31:01.737
The poor are slaves.

31:02.738 --> 31:06.867
Life is nothing but emptiness...

31:08.243 --> 31:09.244
pain.

31:23.675 --> 31:24.718
Okay.

31:26.762 --> 31:27.763
What?

31:29.056 --> 31:30.057
I just--

31:32.434 --> 31:35.479
I guess I needed to make sure
it was really you in there.

31:37.523 --> 31:40.234
Now that you thought this all through...

31:44.446 --> 31:45.572
your fears are rational.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.078
Some of them are.

31:52.246 --> 31:53.872
Does that change anything?

31:56.875 --> 31:57.876
No.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.882
But at least now we're scared together.

32:04.383 --> 32:09.012
Great. Good. That's exactly what I wanted.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.296
You're still aglow from all the adulation.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.719
I admit, you have a natural charisma.

32:48.719 --> 32:52.389
Some might say even irrepressible.

33:00.522 --> 33:02.524
I know you'll find this hard to believe,

33:02.524 --> 33:07.404
but my own public charm is a result
of cultivation.

33:09.364 --> 33:12.534
Even among the Cleons,
there are those of us who are more...

33:15.871 --> 33:18.582
at ease than others on the stage.

33:23.795 --> 33:27.257
But I am grateful to your charisma.

33:27.257 --> 33:33.180
There is a public value in a man
who is willing to accept an able partner.

33:33.180 --> 33:34.306
Don't you agree?

33:37.476 --> 33:38.519
Is something wrong?

33:41.522 --> 33:42.731
I was just thinking,

33:44.399 --> 33:46.443
we've never really talked about my family.

33:48.695 --> 33:49.696
We have.

33:50.864 --> 33:54.243
You're a dilettante,
and yet you're now to be an empress.

33:55.661 --> 33:57.829
That's a story the citizens will embrace.

33:57.829 --> 33:58.997
What I mean is...

34:01.875 --> 34:04.711
even though they're all gone,
they'll be joined to you.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.132
They'll be your kin as well as mine.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.719
So I want for you to know them.

34:14.638 --> 34:15.764
Yes, how nice.

34:20.435 --> 34:21.645
My subtle father,

34:22.478 --> 34:24.398
who never raised his voice to me,

34:25.649 --> 34:27.775
not even
when I accidentally spilled a vial

34:27.775 --> 34:29.820
of priceless orchid pigment into the mud.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.533
All he said was,
"Well, that mud is prettier now."

34:36.702 --> 34:39.121
My brother Thurston,

34:40.496 --> 34:43.375
who once carried an injured comrade
on his back for two whole days

34:43.375 --> 34:45.377
even though his own collarbone was broken.

34:45.960 --> 34:46.962
My mother,

34:48.005 --> 34:51.592
whom I know others thought of as remote,

34:52.592 --> 34:56.763
but who could draw all our faces
just from memory.

34:56.763 --> 34:59.141
Each one a perfect likeness.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.518
My sister Shennin,

35:02.978 --> 35:06.356
who liked to smoke Santannian cigars
while hashing out matters of state.

35:06.356 --> 35:08.775
And who once, when we were younger,

35:08.775 --> 35:11.862
stayed up half the night hunting a spider
in my room so I could sleep.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.411
And then her baby son.

35:22.122 --> 35:23.332
Our little Marréos.

35:25.334 --> 35:27.961
It was a tragedy,
what happened to all of them.

35:29.463 --> 35:30.631
And we will honor them.

35:34.176 --> 35:37.179
I only wish I could tell them
what an impact you've had on their lives.

35:39.264 --> 35:42.392
However indirectly.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.146
But I can't...

35:48.357 --> 35:49.816
so instead I'm telling you.

36:04.915 --> 36:10.838
You are here by some uncanny
combination of good fortune and my grace.

36:12.089 --> 36:14.967
All you need say on both accounts is

36:16.635 --> 36:18.136
"I am grateful."

36:20.806 --> 36:23.183
I am grateful, Empire.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.271
Good.

36:37.030 --> 36:39.283
I need to see Dawn
in a place where the walls can't listen.

36:39.283 --> 36:42.327
- Can you manage it?
- Your will is mine, my queen.

36:49.209 --> 36:50.669
Can we speak freely here?

36:51.170 --> 36:55.090
When we turn 17,
we're taken to every district on Trantor.

36:55.591 --> 36:56.967
The Grand Tour.

36:57.509 --> 36:59.970
I learned a lot of fascinating things
on mine.

36:59.970 --> 37:04.183
Like, for instance,
the Occuli don't work in the heat sinks.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.143
You could've just said yes.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.477
It's Cleonic tradition.

37:08.145 --> 37:10.230
Why use one word when ten will do?

37:16.028 --> 37:18.363
You realize even
with the facial scramblers

37:18.363 --> 37:20.782
that you're risking both of our lives
with this little meeting?

37:20.782 --> 37:22.701
- I know.
- Do you?

37:24.161 --> 37:25.245
This isn't a game.

37:27.289 --> 37:30.459
A Dawn fled the palace once and tried
to escape through Trantor City.

37:30.959 --> 37:31.960
He died for it.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.088
This is the warning we're all given
from childhood.

37:35.088 --> 37:36.173
By Demerzel?

37:39.343 --> 37:40.344
I saw her today.

37:41.678 --> 37:43.013
She killed my family.

37:44.681 --> 37:45.724
On Day's orders.

37:47.976 --> 37:48.977
She told you that?

37:50.187 --> 37:51.480
And he confirmed it.

37:52.814 --> 37:53.982
So, what then?

37:54.566 --> 37:55.776
You'll back out of the marriage?

37:55.776 --> 37:58.195
If I do, Day will kill me,
and you know it.

37:59.112 --> 38:01.949
I've been a prisoner since
the moment I was chosen as his bride.

38:05.869 --> 38:09.039
- So, what do you want from me?
- I can't have that monster's baby.

38:10.165 --> 38:11.166
I can't.

38:14.837 --> 38:17.548
Your brother, he isn't like you.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.552
It's true.

38:21.552 --> 38:23.220
I've known it from the moment we met.

38:24.304 --> 38:25.389
Your eyes are different.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.102
- We have the same eyes.
- No.

38:34.314 --> 38:35.482
Yours are kind.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.155
I could end up just like him.

38:43.782 --> 38:44.867
I don't believe that.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.834
I will marry Day. That much is certain.

38:56.545 --> 38:58.046
The Cleon-Child I carry...

39:00.966 --> 39:02.551
that baby could have your eyes.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.185
My handman palmed it in the medical suite.

39:12.186 --> 39:14.229
Use it,
and you'll be able to sire children.

39:15.856 --> 39:18.734
Gods, do you even know what you're asking?

39:20.485 --> 39:22.696
Your marriage already makes Dusk
and me disposable.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.240
If Day finds out about this,
this is a death sentence.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.075
Your genome is nearly identical.

39:28.118 --> 39:29.203
Day would never know.

39:30.495 --> 39:32.414
He's cutting you out, Dawn.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.792
You'll never sit on the throne.

39:35.792 --> 39:39.087
And when you're dead and gone,
it'll be as though you never even existed.

39:43.133 --> 39:44.134
But...

39:47.095 --> 39:50.682
if the one, true heir were yours...

39:52.684 --> 39:54.311
your legacy would be assured.

39:57.022 --> 39:58.148
Don't you want that?

40:00.108 --> 40:01.818
Don't you want to cast a shadow?

40:04.488 --> 40:06.865
I am told the procedure isn't
that painful.

40:08.325 --> 40:10.369
Neither part of the procedure.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.120
Sareth.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.373
I managed to stop the doctors
from starting fertilization,

40:14.373 --> 40:16.458
but after the wedding,
we won't have another chance.

40:28.846 --> 40:29.972
This is suicide.

40:29.972 --> 40:31.056
No.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.227
It's a bloodless fucking coup.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.370
Follow me.

41:18.854 --> 41:21.356
- Should I speak first or will you?
- Constant.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.151
Empire.

41:24.151 --> 41:27.446
- Following custom, we have a gift for you.
- Is that right?

41:28.030 --> 41:29.114
Is it your contrition?

41:29.740 --> 41:31.366
Is it amends?

41:31.366 --> 41:32.826
It's an atomic ashtray.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.915
- Absurd.
- War is coming, Empire.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.459
The Prophet sent us here
to treat with you.

41:40.459 --> 41:43.754
Your prophet gives weighty orders
for a man long dead.

41:44.254 --> 41:45.380
He's come back.

41:46.173 --> 41:49.092
And he has brought hope with him.
Hope for all of us.

41:49.092 --> 41:50.886
So, you're what then?

41:52.304 --> 41:53.722
His priests?

41:54.389 --> 41:56.183
- Missionaries?
- We're...

41:58.435 --> 41:59.645
salesmen.

42:01.313 --> 42:06.026
You have let the planets
on the Outer Reach slide into wildness.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.778
They don't trust strangers,

42:08.403 --> 42:10.572
but they do like a show.

42:10.572 --> 42:12.324
So, when we bring them the word,

42:12.324 --> 42:15.244
it takes a bit of busking
for them before they can hear it.

42:15.244 --> 42:18.205
You three, on the other hand,

42:19.206 --> 42:21.041
are a civilized man.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.876
So I won't talk down to you.

42:22.876 --> 42:24.586
Could you, from way down there?

42:24.586 --> 42:27.840
We were sent to open diplomatic relations.

42:27.840 --> 42:32.553
To ask recognition of Foundation
on the galactic stage.

42:32.553 --> 42:34.888
We seek sovereignty.

42:34.888 --> 42:37.808
You are an imperial outpost.

42:37.808 --> 42:39.852
A property, not a partner.

42:40.352 --> 42:42.145
Such similar words.

42:44.356 --> 42:47.276
And alliance with the Foundation
will give you the guarantee

42:47.276 --> 42:51.363
of the most important thing
Empire could ever possess.

42:52.072 --> 42:52.906
Peace.

42:53.866 --> 42:56.869
So you really did come to put on a show.

42:57.411 --> 43:00.664
Selling us peace, while prodding
for rebellion behind our backs.

43:01.331 --> 43:03.083
The Spacers have rejected your man

43:03.083 --> 43:05.794
Hober Mallow's attempt to seduce them
into treason.

43:07.421 --> 43:08.422
Look at that.

43:09.131 --> 43:12.634
Genuine, gaping dull-eyed surprise.

43:13.218 --> 43:17.389
You know, Claric, I believe you're telling
the truth.

43:17.931 --> 43:23.395
But the girl, she looks
like she's got something on her mind.

43:24.479 --> 43:27.733
Come on, little one. Out with it.

43:35.741 --> 43:36.825
All right.

43:44.958 --> 43:47.669
Same faces. Same room.

43:48.712 --> 43:52.132
- Does nothing ever change in Empire?
- Guards.

43:52.132 --> 43:54.301
What the hell is going on here?

43:54.301 --> 43:56.887
Captain Timandra
first spotted it at the port.

43:56.887 --> 43:59.014
Dual brain scans were detected.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.352
Hari Seldon.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.439
You sneaky little bastard.

44:08.023 --> 44:11.610
I thought you were against extending one's
influence beyond one's own life span,

44:11.610 --> 44:16.281
but you bothered to cheat death
and travel light-years on top of that.

44:16.281 --> 44:19.284
So, say what you've come to say.

44:19.284 --> 44:21.662
I haven't traveled all that far.

44:21.662 --> 44:25.040
I, what remains of me,
am still on Terminus.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.793
This is just a thin sliver of myself.

44:29.211 --> 44:30.420
You're on Terminus?

44:31.505 --> 44:32.631
That's fascinating.

44:34.508 --> 44:37.553
Why then are you also here?

44:38.220 --> 44:40.305
To underline my claric's words.

44:41.306 --> 44:44.017
And to warn you
that the Foundation is not toothless.

44:45.394 --> 44:49.815
We have technology, ships,
arms capable of laying waste.

44:49.815 --> 44:53.485
We sue for peace
not because we fear we will lose,

44:53.485 --> 44:55.988
but because we know
with mathematical certainty,

44:55.988 --> 44:58.448
if there is war, we shall win.

45:02.995 --> 45:04.413
Do you know I studied you?

45:06.331 --> 45:08.500
I had time to read in my youth.

45:11.461 --> 45:12.588
I read you.

45:13.338 --> 45:17.634
It was unsettling to learn
that one man can't change much,

45:17.634 --> 45:20.596
until I read that I, explicitly, could.

45:21.305 --> 45:24.433
You said
the Genetic Dynasty weakened Empire.

45:24.433 --> 45:27.186
Do you remember? You called us grapes.

45:30.230 --> 45:31.398
Who wants to tell him?

45:34.693 --> 45:36.278
Never mind, I will.

45:37.404 --> 45:38.530
No more clones.

45:39.489 --> 45:42.075
A young bride-to-be already warms my bed.

45:42.075 --> 45:45.078
A fourth throne will soon share the dais.

45:45.078 --> 45:47.456
Your predictions are out of date, Seldon.

45:48.498 --> 45:49.499
Just like you.

45:51.126 --> 45:54.379
Demerzel, have General Riose
form an enclosure around Terminus,

45:54.379 --> 45:57.216
and reinforce him with ships
from the Auxiliary.

45:57.216 --> 45:59.551
If the Foundation has technology
worth having,

45:59.551 --> 46:03.263
take an inventory
because it belongs to us.

46:04.348 --> 46:05.349
Yes, Empire.

46:07.851 --> 46:09.478
Thanks for the ashtray.

46:26.995 --> 46:28.163
Constant!

46:30.958 --> 46:32.584
I knew he was there in my mind.

46:33.168 --> 46:36.213
But I couldn't say it
because he'd stop me.

46:37.089 --> 46:38.924
He was suppressing your will.

46:39.508 --> 46:42.135
What kind of a ghost is this man
you follow?

46:42.636 --> 46:46.139
Who keeps an elder in the dark
and uses the body of a girl.

46:47.391 --> 46:49.685
You love him.
You'll forgive him, but still,

46:51.186 --> 46:52.354
the violation.

47:06.952 --> 47:10.497
When will we learn to doubt
when a Thespin comes bearing a gift?

47:14.585 --> 47:19.006
Your prophet has placed you
in a very ugly position.

47:22.885 --> 47:24.178
Take them away.

48:13.685 --> 48:14.895
What are you doing?

48:16.188 --> 48:18.023
Finally opening my goddamn eyes.

48:18.774 --> 48:21.443
- What do you mean?
- I was down here this morning with Loron.

48:21.443 --> 48:23.278
He's talking to me, I'm talking to him.

48:23.278 --> 48:24.821
He looks over at this boat,

48:24.821 --> 48:28.951
I flip my coin and suddenly I can't
call it cats or crowns.

48:29.785 --> 48:31.620
Someone was blocking me.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.205
Now, Loron was looking at this boat,

48:33.205 --> 48:36.250
because, unlike the others,
its nav data is erased.

48:36.250 --> 48:39.253
Why erase data from a fishing trip?

48:39.253 --> 48:41.380
What would you have done
if they'd caught you out here?

48:42.339 --> 48:44.424
I was careful. Look.

48:44.424 --> 48:47.636
They erased the day's routes, but they
didn't overwrite the navigation cache.

48:47.636 --> 48:49.805
- This boat went somewhere different--
- Salvor, stop.

48:50.389 --> 48:52.391
There are things happening here
that you don't understand.

48:52.391 --> 48:54.268
And right now,
you just need to accept that.

48:54.268 --> 48:59.022
No. You and Hari both said
that this is bigger than any one person.

48:59.022 --> 49:01.859
And now you think you can just change
the future all by yourself?

49:01.859 --> 49:03.360
- Salvor.
- No. Listen to me.

49:03.360 --> 49:05.821
I grew up hearing I was special.

49:05.821 --> 49:08.448
And it messed with my head,
thinking that way.

49:08.448 --> 49:10.909
- I don't think I'm special.
- Are you sure?

49:11.827 --> 49:14.621
'Cause they're all looking at you
like you're their fucking savior.

49:15.247 --> 49:16.248
And that is fine.

49:16.957 --> 49:18.417
As long as you don't start believing it.

49:23.130 --> 49:26.592
You don't need to trust them,
but you do need to trust me.

49:27.593 --> 49:29.469
This is not the time to pull threads.

49:30.220 --> 49:31.597
Do you understand?

50:24.983 --> 50:25.984
Okay, boat.

50:26.735 --> 50:28.320
Let's see where you went last night.

51:48.192 --> 51:51.153
Well, this is an unfortunate thread
you've pulled.

51:52.404 --> 51:54.364
- You mo--
- No words, dear.

51:55.782 --> 51:58.619
We did try to spare you from this, Salvor.

51:58.619 --> 52:00.037
Seeing him.

52:01.163 --> 52:02.414
I'm very sorry.

52:04.791 --> 52:07.920
I want this place to be a sanctuary.

52:09.004 --> 52:12.382
But it's like I told you when we talked
about the little creatures at lunch,

52:13.133 --> 52:15.969
sometimes you have to absorb the pain.

52:16.470 --> 52:20.849
Because sometimes
a little death is necessary.
