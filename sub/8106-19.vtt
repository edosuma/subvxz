WEBVTT

00:06.382 --> 00:12.011
Jasper, hold still.
Stop squirming, hold still.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.513
What did he do now?

00:13.639 --> 00:16.724
He got in another fight and I can't
get his nose to stop bleeding.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.144
You have to apply
much more pressure than that.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.438
You had to do this today.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.525
I got office hours, I'm supposed
to have dinner with the Dean.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.652
You just can't lash out
whenever you get angry.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.237
He said I smelled like
a monkey.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.030
Well, you do. You can't
refuse to take a bath

00:31.156 --> 00:33.866
and then hit kids
who tell you that you smell. Damn.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.410
Don't you think
we should call 911?

00:35.536 --> 00:38.621
This isn't his first
nosebleed. He'll be fine.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.499
- Daddy!
- Hey! Lucy Goosey!

00:41.625 --> 00:42.875
I'm playing doctor.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.962
So am I. Can you
go back and play?

00:48.048 --> 00:51.759
- When was this fight?
- Over ten minutes ago.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.094
I feel dizzy.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.554
Maybe you should
make that call.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.222
Okay.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.849
Daddy, look, I can help.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.685
No, no, that's great, honey.
Can you just please leave Daddy alone?

01:00.811 --> 01:04.856
One of my kids is bleeding
profusely from the nose. Please hurry.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.401
They're sending an ambulance.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.951
Call them back. He'll be fine.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.036
How you feeling, bud?
You light-headed?

01:19.163 --> 01:20.246
Lucy.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.082
Oh, my God.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.253
Lucy? Are you okay?
Lucy? Lucy?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.922
Lucy? Lucy, are you okay?

01:30.132 --> 01:32.967
Lucy! Lucy!

02:13.467 --> 02:14.842
Oh, for God's sake.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.094
Stop. Don't move.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.599
The way the soft evening
light catches your eyes.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.684
The gentle caress of dusk
on your hair

02:23.811 --> 02:26.646
as you turn around and leave my office
without giving me that file.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.397
Restrictive pericarditis.

02:28.524 --> 02:29.440
Boring.

02:29.566 --> 02:30.525
She's in kindergarten.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.569
Less boring. Or Grandma's
been held back a few years.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.696
It's calcified
and she's hypertensive.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.449
- Better get her into surgery.
- She already is in surgery.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.868
Tricky procedure.
It's gonna take all night.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.620
Sleep tight.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.581
No congenital defects,
no health problems,

02:45.707 --> 02:47.625
but her heart is
strangling itself.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.253
Fascinating.
Since the pathology on the pericardium

02:50.379 --> 02:52.255
won't be back
until after they remove it.

02:52.381 --> 02:56.300
Get started on her blood. You can test
for viral infections, bacterial...

02:56.426 --> 02:58.427
Round up the usual suspects.

02:58.554 --> 03:01.681
Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis,
hemochromatosis.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.016
Heck, go wild.
Do all the -osises.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.518
All taken care of.
Sleep tight.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.280
This thing is already
all around her heart.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.323
It gets into the muscle,
she's dead.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.409
Best bet's Coxsackie virus,

03:21.535 --> 03:23.536
Parvovirus B19, CMV.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.956
Bacterial infection's more likely to
turn constrictive. It could be TB.

03:27.082 --> 03:31.252
Right, forgot about the part
where she did time in a Russian gulag.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.503
Her hematocrit's elevated.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.921
A few extra red blood cells
means nothing.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.172
She's probably
just dehydrated.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.717
Yes, and I could assume three or four
things to fit my theory, too.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.677
She's sick! She obviously hasn't
been drinking enough...

03:39.803 --> 03:41.220
Enough!

03:42.639 --> 03:46.225
I take it you two aren't sleeping
together anymore?

03:46.351 --> 03:48.144
We do what House said,
we test for everything.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.856
Good, then I can go home.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.191
Since when does
we not include you?

03:54.318 --> 03:55.943
Well, House is gonna
call us idiots, anyway.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.030
Might as well be
a well-rested idiot.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.701
You guys are idiots.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.371
Why? Because we stayed up all night
doing exactly what you told us to do?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.499
No, because you stayed up all night
doing exactly what I told you to do

04:10.626 --> 04:11.626
and have nothing
to show for it.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.669
We eliminated dozens
of wrong answers.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.590
I asked you what two plus two equals and
a day later you tell me, "Not 25."

04:17.716 --> 04:19.592
Pathology report
just got filed.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.094
They found granulomas
in Lucy's pericardium.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.180
Indicates a fungal infection.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.223
Nice work.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.266
He went home.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.145
Work smart, not hard.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.107
Find out which fungus.
Biopsy a lymph node.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.443
Take employee of the month
with you.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.363
- I would rather Foreman...
- I know.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.581
I don't want any more shots.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.833
Jasper.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.877
Look at me, Goosey.
Squeeze my hand, okay?

04:55.003 --> 04:58.005
This will tell us why you're sick, so
that we can make you all better.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.924
Where would she pick up
a fungus?

05:00.050 --> 05:03.177
Anywhere moist. Around a pool,
locker room, public shower...

05:03.303 --> 05:05.012
She doesn't have any gym
or swim classes.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.306
She doesn't even like to play
with kids outside.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.643
You haven't taken any trips?
Gone anywhere new?

05:10.769 --> 05:13.938
It's been hard to get away
since their mom...

05:14.064 --> 05:15.523
Our mom is dead.

05:17.776 --> 05:21.237
- I'm sorry.
- Last year. Brain cancer.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.158
You're gonna stick that thing
in her arm?

05:26.284 --> 05:27.743
Cool!

05:27.869 --> 05:30.997
The cool part is
your sister won't feel a thing.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.589
Nice necklace.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.384
- Thanks.
- You like video games?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.386
Love them.

05:47.305 --> 05:50.224
That should do it. You okay?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.226
I want my bunny.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.277
Are you being silly?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.696
I didn't know
which one to take.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.033
What do you mean?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.243
What's happening?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.415
So. What does
the double vision tell us?

06:14.541 --> 06:17.001
Slit lamp revealed the eye's
anterior chamber is swollen.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.920
Uveitis. Means it's not a post-op effect
and it's not neurological.

06:20.047 --> 06:23.132
It's not fungal, either.
Lymph node biopsy was clean.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.300
So, we're back to square one.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.761
One and a half. We've eliminated
two more conditions.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.472
Yes. Two plus two doesn't
equal 12 or 16, either.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.558
Vision issues plus screwy heart equals
some type of autoimmune.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.977
Lupus and Kawasaki's are
the most common in a six-year-old.

06:35.103 --> 06:39.273
Yeah, tough to find a six-year-old who
doesn't have Lupus or Kawasaki's...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.567
Did you look at her knees?

06:42.819 --> 06:46.030
Those knobby things in the middle
of her legs. Any scars or scabs?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.198
What does that
have to do with...

06:47.324 --> 06:49.825
Well, most six-year-olds
hurt themselves a lot.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.745
Crash their bikes,
climb trees, bungee jump...

06:52.871 --> 06:54.747
Dad says she doesn't like
to run around outside.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.582
'Cause running around
outside hurts.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.000
She didn't mention anything...

06:58.126 --> 07:02.838
Most six-year-olds are not familiar with
the phrase, "My joints feel inflamed."

07:02.964 --> 07:05.382
So, two plus two equals...

07:05.509 --> 07:07.384
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

07:07.511 --> 07:11.097
We're checking her ANA to confirm and
giving her steroids to fix her vision.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.391
Some idiot gave me two tickets
for a play tonight.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.062
Saved his life.
Apparently worth $186.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.564
Sorry, had to take a leak.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.942
Oh, I didn't know
you were seeing a patient.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.069
It's an exam room.
What did you think I was doing?

07:25.195 --> 07:27.404
What you usually do.
Hiding from Cuddy.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.533
Well, it'd be stupid to do it in here.
There's a patient in here.

07:30.659 --> 07:31.867
You been drinking more?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.369
No, I haven't.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.704
Guy's peeing all the time.
Play. Interested?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.164
Sure. You want me
to pick you up?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.625
- Well, I'm not going.
- You said two tickets.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.669
You thought this was a date?

07:42.712 --> 07:43.629
Any other symptoms?

07:43.880 --> 07:44.797
My stomach hurts.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.508
I have back pain
and muscle aches,

07:47.634 --> 07:51.303
I feel dizzy and I have trouble
concentrating sometimes in class.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.972
I really should...

07:53.098 --> 07:54.306
You want the tickets or not?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.144
- Why don't you want to go with me?
- It's a play.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.980
Dudes only go to plays
if they're dragged by women

08:01.106 --> 08:02.148
they're hoping to see naked.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.941
So, why are you
giving them to me?

08:04.067 --> 08:06.402
Maybe there's someone
you wanna see naked.

08:08.864 --> 08:09.989
All right.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.617
- Any fever?
- No.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.452
Anything in your pee
other than pee?

08:15.579 --> 08:16.787
No.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.080
I'm going to need
a urine sample.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.874
No!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.458
Yeah, that last one
wasn't a question.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.503
- You might have diabetes...
- I can't pee in public.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.463
We have bathrooms.

08:28.049 --> 08:32.261
I can't pee
in public bathrooms.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.139
Where can you pee?

08:35.265 --> 08:38.017
I only live
a few miles from here.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.270
I thought arthritis
was for old people.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.064
JRA is an autoimmune disease.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.858
Her body's attacking itself,

08:45.984 --> 08:49.570
causing inflammation in the joints,
her eyes, and her heart.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.197
Is it treatable?

08:51.323 --> 08:54.783
It can be crippling, but it can also
go into complete remission.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.077
Well, the good thing is
we caught it early.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.747
Gives her the best chance
to have a positive outcome.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.290
Dad.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.708
Don't get up, Goosey.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.211
Your stitches.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.276
She's having a stroke.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.664
The stroke was caused by a clot
in her middle cerebral artery.

09:41.790 --> 09:42.790
Started her on tPA.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.084
Should dissolve the clot
and hopefully prevent brain damage,

09:45.210 --> 09:47.711
but we won't know for sure
until she regains consciousness.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.838
Or she has another stroke.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.842
Arthritis, heart disease.
Why can't this kid act her age?

09:53.969 --> 09:56.929
JRA doesn't affect the blood. That means
the clot's a symptom of something else.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.389
It's a symptom of
polycythemia.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.558
She's fully hydrated and her blood's
still thicker than pancake batter.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.269
Well, thick blood
explains the stroke.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.104
It could also have caused
an autoimmune response,

10:05.230 --> 10:07.356
which would explain
the JRA kicking into gear.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.857
But what explains
the thick blood?

10:08.984 --> 10:11.485
Lack of oxygen forces the body
to overproduce red cells.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.820
What explains
the lack of oxygen?

10:13.154 --> 10:15.030
Carbon monoxide fumes,
cigarette smoke.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.657
I doubt our patient's
a smoker.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.867
- Dad could be.
- He's not.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.703
- He says he's not.
- Hey!

10:21.204 --> 10:22.830
Don't make me turn the hose
on you two.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.332
Chase is right.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.294
You two go check the house,
see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.753
You're intentionally
punishing us.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.631
By making you do your job?
Does seem kind of cruel, doesn't it?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.925
Take along a carbon monoxide
detector to check for leaks,

10:35.051 --> 10:38.512
and, you, start her on hydroxyurea to
control her red blood cell production.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.514
Dig out a Merck Manual,
Medieval edition.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.268
Tell you how to drain
a pint or two so she doesn't clot again.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.153
Dr. Cameron!

10:55.655 --> 10:58.157
I got you flowers
for helping my sister.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.659
That's so sweet.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.286
Does your dad know
you're down here?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.829
Yes.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.877
"Congratulations
on your bundle of joy."

11:10.003 --> 11:12.963
Something you forgot
to tell me?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.007
You should take these back
to where you found them.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.967
- Okay.
- Excuse me?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.260
Can you make sure
these flowers

11:18.386 --> 11:20.137
and this kid both get back
to where they belong?

11:20.263 --> 11:21.263
Sure.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.016
- Thanks.
- Let's go. Come on.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.853
Wait.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.500
So, you're just
draining blood from her?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.168
You're not testing it?
You're not fixing it?

11:51.294 --> 11:54.129
Your daughter's vascular system
is engorged with blood.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.007
Draining some reduces
the chances of another stroke.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.844
We're also starting her on a drug that
suppresses the production of red cells

12:00.970 --> 12:03.138
so we don't have to
keep doing this.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.850
Good chance
she'll make a full recovery.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.394
She hasn't spoken yet.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.521
Give her time.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.652
This your boy?

12:16.778 --> 12:19.530
- Where have you been?
- Exploring. See ya.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.240
Thank you.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.450
You know you can't just
run off without telling me.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.245
Okay. Can I have $2?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.583
Oven's a long shot.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.585
They'd smell the gas
long before anyone got sick.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.629
Yeah, right. House loves it
when we skip something

12:35.755 --> 12:37.965
'cause it's a long shot.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.052
Why did you take the flower?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.720
- Why did you kiss him?
- He did something sweet.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.013
He stole flowers.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.849
He's eight.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.144
You're trying to
make me jealous.

12:50.270 --> 12:54.273
Yeah, I want you to
profess your love for me. Oh, wait.

12:54.399 --> 12:58.152
You already did that and it caused me
to end our relationship.

12:59.404 --> 13:03.157
You're enabling a thief
and a delinquent!

13:05.952 --> 13:10.080
Letters from school. Fights, detentions,
a parent conference...

13:10.206 --> 13:14.209
Oh, I know, I know.
Bad boys, hard to resist.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.878
It's a crush. It's harmless.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.464
- It's never harmless.
- So I'm learning.

13:21.176 --> 13:24.803
So, this is us now?
We snipe at each other?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.597
I'm not sniping,
I'm looking for a vent.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.890
Her room's directly above the garage.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.185
There's all sorts
of CO sources down there.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.939
I found a vent.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.901
I think there's
something in it.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.494
This isn't right.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.289
You dumped me.
You don't get to be mad.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.252
We had a really good thing.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.463
You broke the rules.
I'm angry.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.802
I'll get over it.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.031
She's being abused.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.909
A bloody T-shirt doesn't
equal abuse. Kids get hurt all the time.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.203
That amount of blood?

14:32.622 --> 14:34.206
Oh, crap.

14:34.332 --> 14:36.375
You two are agreeing again.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.001
Her father's overwhelmed.
Hectic job,

14:38.127 --> 14:40.629
his wife passed away last year, he could
easily be taking it out on the kids.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.881
Or she had a nosebleed
and grabbed a T-shirt.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.383
She's so ashamed
of a nosebleed

14:44.509 --> 14:47.010
she has to hide the evidence
in a vent under her bed?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.930
She's socially isolated, the brother's
always in trouble, it's classic signs.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.181
But no physical signs.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.684
No marks on her body,
no bruises at all.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.145
What if it's sexual?

14:58.106 --> 15:00.274
We should call
Social Services.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.693
Well, this sucks.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.237
Either it's abuse,
or it's not abuse,

15:05.363 --> 15:07.739
which means either it's a symptom
or it's completely irrelevant.

15:07.865 --> 15:11.368
Either way, we got to waste half a day
figuring out which.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.412
Full physical exam.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.707
Look for bruises we may have missed,
check her mouth and do a vaginal exam.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.917
We can't do a vaginal exam
on a six-year-old

15:19.043 --> 15:20.002
without the dad's consent.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.130
And if he's abusing her,
he'll never say yes.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.049
"Never" is just "reven"
spelled backwards.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.809
Have you been abusing
your daughter?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.312
What? Why would you...

15:38.855 --> 15:42.232
We found this hidden in a vent
under her bed.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.992
I don't know anything about this.
Maybe she had a bloody nose?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.452
We need to examine her
for abuse.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.661
You can't really think I...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.204
Maybe you,
maybe the school bully,

15:56.331 --> 15:57.247
maybe the creepy neighbor.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.875
I'm guessing you're not paying as much
attention as you should be.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.835
Do you even know
where your son is right now?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.838
Yeah, he was here just...
Here a minute ago.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.092
She isn't being abused.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.303
Unfortunately, that answer
doesn't help me.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.512
If you have abused her,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.890
- you're obviously gonna lie about it.
- I'm not lying!

16:15.016 --> 16:16.725
- We need to do a vaginal exam.
- No.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.893
She may be dying,

16:18.019 --> 16:21.146
she still can't talk and you're gonna
waste your time with this?

16:21.272 --> 16:24.941
Either you consent and we waste a few
hours doing the exam, or you refuse

16:25.068 --> 16:28.779
and I call Social Services and they
waste three days doing an investigation

16:28.905 --> 16:31.323
which ends with them
doing the exam anyway.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.505
Okay. I'm gonna look
inside your mouth. Open wide.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.966
I need to look at your chest
and your back next, okay?

16:51.594 --> 16:55.305
I know you can't talk,
so stop me if you get scared.

17:02.647 --> 17:07.109
Before you came here, did anyone
hurt you? Make you bleed?

17:08.403 --> 17:11.738
I need to look
in your vagina now. Do you understand?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.116
I'm a doctor, so it's okay.
All right?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.952
Bend your knees,
keep your ankles together

17:17.078 --> 17:19.788
and just let your knees fall
to the side, okay?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.628
Oh, my God.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.048
She has cuts all over her genital area,
like slices.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.008
Some are almost healed,
but some are new.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.135
She could be doing it
to herself.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.845
She's a little young
to be cutting.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.888
She's a little young
for a stroke.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.183
Depression accounts for the cuts,
molestation accounts for the depression.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.685
But do the cuts account
for all that blood?

17:41.811 --> 17:42.769
They weren't deep enough.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.439
So she's getting cut,
but that's not the source of the blood?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.899
The other obvious source
is forcible penetration.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.568
The obvious source
of the blood, not the cuts.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.862
There was no tearing,
there's no evidence at all.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.323
So we have no explanation
for the cuts or the blood.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.700
Where is he?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.453
What if our original
assumption was wrong?

17:59.704 --> 18:00.537
Meaning what?

18:00.997 --> 18:04.166
We found a T-shirt covered with blood
hidden in a heating vent.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.542
How do we know it's even hers?

18:05.668 --> 18:06.877
Her dad identified it.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.463
Not the shirt, the blood.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.222
Are those
the urine test results?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.224
- Yes.
- And...

18:21.350 --> 18:23.810
- I'm going to ask you for some blood.
- Why?

18:23.936 --> 18:27.397
To see if your answer will be,
"I can't bleed in public."

18:28.232 --> 18:29.858
This wasn't your urine,
was it?

18:29.984 --> 18:31.485
Why would I give you
someone else's urine?

18:31.611 --> 18:34.070
The usual reason is
because you're on steroids.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.322
I'm not an athlete.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.034
Second favorite reason is
because you're on drugs.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.660
- I'm not.
- I am.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.871
Third favorite reason
is you have insurance

18:42.997 --> 18:44.831
but your
friend Eggs Benedict doesn't.

18:45.249 --> 18:49.044
So, Eggs describes a list of symptoms
and you repeat them to a doctor,

18:49.170 --> 18:52.547
which is particularly stupid
because this is a free clinic.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.051
Need you, now.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.553
My work here is done.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.307
Am I okay?
Is it diabetes?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.309
No, you're pregnant.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.361
Six-year-old abuse victim and you
haven't called Social Services?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.655
She might've been abused?
That's horrifying.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.658
Why are you wearing
extra concealer under your eyes?

19:19.951 --> 19:23.161
The law's clear. You suspect abuse,
you call the authorities.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.790
You don't proceed as usual while the
possible abuser sits by her bedside.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.751
Dad consented to the exam
which means it's not the dad.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.503
How late were you
out last night?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.548
It's always the dad
and I don't have a curfew.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.217
Panty hamster
get a spin on its wheel?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.679
I went to a play.

19:40.805 --> 19:44.474
House, you are going back to your
office. You are picking up your phone,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.853
calling Social Services and you are
reporting suspected abuse.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.479
Do you understand?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.982
What play?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.659
You're trying to have sex
with Cuddy.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.663
- Fries?
- You took her to a play.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.748
You only take women
to plays because...

20:08.875 --> 20:12.836
No, you only take women to plays for
that reason. That's your theory.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.088
Okay. Then why did you
take her to a play?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.172
She's a friend.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.674
A friend with a squish mitten.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.385
It is possible to have a friend
of the opposite sex without...

20:20.511 --> 20:22.095
Blasphemer!

20:22.221 --> 20:25.098
She's not a friend of the opposite sex,
she's a different species.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.057
She's an administrator.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.018
She's going to eat your head
after she's done.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.936
Yes, I slept with her.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.230
- Seriously?
- No.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.484
Yes, you did.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.195
Yes, I did.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.198
- Seriously?
- No.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.035
You've got a problem, House.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.624
We just tested the blood
on Lucy's T-shirt,

20:50.750 --> 20:53.043
it's full of
endometrial cells.

20:53.794 --> 20:54.836
So it's not her blood.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.963
We tested that, too. It is.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.174
Your six-year-old patient?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.260
It's menstrual blood.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.472
She's started puberty.

21:10.728 --> 21:15.023
How can someone start puberty before
they even start the first grade?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.817
She was in diapers
two years ago.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.237
For some reason her body
has too much sex hormone.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.240
It caused her
reproductive system to get confused,

21:24.367 --> 21:26.326
start operating prematurely.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.454
We need to find out the source
of the hormones and cut it off.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.705
She's so young.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.584
I haven't even

21:35.544 --> 21:37.545
talked to her about sex.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.548
I doubt she even knows
what a period is.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.516
Girls talk to their moms
about that.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.318
You're gonna be okay, Goosey.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.654
I love you.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.116
I

22:07.618 --> 22:08.743
want

22:10.579 --> 22:11.746
juice.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.754
She got her period
and didn't know what it was.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.256
She was scared and confused.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.758
A friend told her to put a T-shirt
in her underwear.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.468
When she started
growing pubic hair,

22:25.594 --> 22:27.929
she snuck Daddy's razor
and tried to shave it off.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.473
Apparently forgot to sneak
the shaving cream.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.725
Tumor's most likely.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.477
A pituitary adenoma would send her
hormone level sky-high.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.564
In Puerto Rico, in the '70s, there was
an epidemic of kids growing breasts

22:37.690 --> 22:39.566
because of estrogen
in the poultry.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.610
If it was in the food, it would be an
epidemic. We've got one kid.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.822
She's six, she's tiny, she lives
on chicken fingers and milk.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.615
Dad doesn't look like
the type to read labels,

22:47.742 --> 22:50.493
he's probably buying stuff
packed full of hormones.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.704
Excellent argument.
It's a tumor.

22:52.997 --> 22:56.916
There's all sorts of environmental
sources. Pesticides, soy products.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.211
Some shampoos are basically a placenta
in a bottle.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.590
If the tumor's not in her brain,
it's in her reproductive tract.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.175
Get an MRI.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.926
- Can I at least...
- Waste your time?

23:07.053 --> 23:09.554
Wouldn't recognize you
if you didn't.

23:15.853 --> 23:19.147
Frontal cortex is clean,
moving caudally.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.277
For the record,
Cameron's the one who broke it off.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.695
Not interested.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.907
No masses in the hypothalamus.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.825
I wanted more.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.745
She didn't share my feelings.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.581
I feel like
I'm in a similar position.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.294
Pituitary's clean.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.505
You're an idiot.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.382
Either she's lying or she's actually
emotionally detached.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.551
Which one sounds more
like Cameron to you?

23:48.677 --> 23:49.886
Neither.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.554
You have to choose one.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.311
There's a bright spot
on her left ovary.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.108
Looks like a solid tumor.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.825
They printed my letter.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.453
You were right.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.622
Of course I was.
What are we talking about?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.415
- They printed my letter.
- Great.

24:19.542 --> 24:20.708
Cuddy.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.211
- You want to see her naked?
- No, no, no.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.755
She wants to see me naked.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.008
She sent me flowers.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.718
Just thanking you
for the play.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.388
See, some people feel
an emotion called gratitude.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.557
- There's a card.
- I suspected.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.517
It explains how you knew
who they were from.

24:37.893 --> 24:42.063
"Let's do it again.
Soon. XX, Lisa."

24:42.481 --> 24:43.523
Xs are the kisses, right?

24:43.649 --> 24:45.233
No, I think they're the hugs.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.276
I think Os are the kisses.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.945
No, no. The Xs are
definitely the kisses.

24:49.071 --> 24:52.073
"Soon" is its own sentence.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.535
I gotta go!

24:59.540 --> 25:02.375
I'll miss you.
You were a good friend.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.379
They printed my letter.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.964
How was the play,
Mrs. Lincoln?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.465
What's up with Wilson?

25:09.592 --> 25:10.508
He's just a little freaked.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.843
Why?

25:12.428 --> 25:14.345
I sent him flowers.

25:25.399 --> 25:26.733
Jasper, you're not
supposed to be up here.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.152
Is that other doctor
your boyfriend?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.070
No.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.614
Your dad's probably looking
for you.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.282
He's got enough to
worry about right now.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.950
Do you like him?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.994
He's a friend.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.871
Do you like him, like him?

25:40.539 --> 25:41.956
We should get you
back to your dad.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.293
Let me put this down
and I'll take you there.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.383
I could be your boyfriend.

25:52.509 --> 25:56.596
I think that wouldn't be fair
to the girls your own age.

25:56.805 --> 26:01.059
- He seems like a tool.
- He's not. And that's rude.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.102
I'm taking you back
to your father.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.326
The mass is small.
About a centimeter across.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.370
Firing the biopsy needle.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.333
You nick an artery?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.751
No.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.378
She's in V tach. No pulse.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.172
- Charging 50.
- Clear.

26:33.425 --> 26:37.845
Clear.

26:40.391 --> 26:43.351
Arrhythmia must have been
a reaction to the hydroxyurea.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.644
We have to stop
the drug therapy.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.021
Her bone marrow will just go back to
overproducing blood cells,

26:47.147 --> 26:49.232
she'll keep having strokes
and we'll have to keep bleeding her.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.316
Forever.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.904
We resect the tumor, hormone levels go
back to normal, her symptoms go away.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.157
Great plan, except for the fact
that her tumor's not a tumor.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.451
It's a benign cyst.

27:04.206 --> 27:08.001
If it's not a tumor, that just leaves
an environmental source.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.129
I'm feeling
another late night.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.341
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.302
- You're kidding me, right?
- What?

27:17.428 --> 27:19.429
The answer's right there.
It's just a question of finding it.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.972
You don't need me for that.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.526
Don't get the mochaccino

27:34.069 --> 27:37.405
they screwed up
and put hot chocolate in the dispenser.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.073
Thank you.

27:39.408 --> 27:43.411
You were right.
The eight-year-old kid grabbed my ass.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.372
I shouldn't have
encouraged him.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.958
Well, I was a boy once.
I know how they think.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.543
You were a pervert at eight?

27:51.003 --> 27:52.337
Maybe eleven.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.387
I didn't realize
you were gonna get hurt.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.557
I'm sorry I misled you.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.018
You didn't.

28:08.645 --> 28:11.356
You have feelings for me.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.192
You come back to me
again and again.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.819
- For sex. It's a simple physical...
- Come on.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.864
You have feelings for puppies
and patients that you barely know.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.951
But when it comes to a guy
that you've worked with for three years,

28:24.078 --> 28:27.246
had sex with,
spent the night with...

28:28.624 --> 28:31.000
You telling me
you feel nothing?

28:32.544 --> 28:34.045
Absolutely nothing?

28:34.171 --> 28:37.548
Get away from her! Don't touch her!
I'll kill you if you touch her!

28:37.674 --> 28:40.093
- Jasper!
- Get him off!

28:40.219 --> 28:42.929
He's biting me. Get him off!

28:49.061 --> 28:50.603
What is he gonna do?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.605
He stopped and looked at him
from the top rope!

28:52.815 --> 28:55.817
But now he's scaling...
No way!

29:04.701 --> 29:06.077
Somebody better be dying.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.914
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me,
so he bit the crap out of Chase.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.457
And I care because...

29:11.583 --> 29:13.709
Just thought you might
want to know when one of your employees

29:13.836 --> 29:15.420
gets attacked by a sociopath.

29:15.546 --> 29:17.380
Bees or monkeys, yes.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.590
Sociopaths, no.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.846
He doesn't have sense enough
to know he was pinned.

29:24.972 --> 29:26.973
He's not a man,
he is a monster!

29:27.099 --> 29:28.599
No way!

29:28.725 --> 29:31.519
We've got to take
another look at this...

29:31.645 --> 29:33.896
That might be what he needed.
Unable to somehow kick out of a...

29:41.864 --> 29:44.115
- Hello?
- He's not a sociopath.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.533
How do you know?

29:45.659 --> 29:47.326
He's acting logically.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.163
He's got a crush on you.
He's being aggressive about it.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.039
Not just regular aggressive,

29:52.583 --> 29:55.793
he's out-of-his-mind-on-hormones
aggressive.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.086
You think he's...

29:57.212 --> 30:01.215
Better figure out what's killing the
girl, because her brother's got it, too.

30:04.261 --> 30:07.013
Jasper's got
a hundred times more testosterone

30:07.306 --> 30:08.639
than a healthy eight-year-old.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.184
But we scanned his brain
and reproductive tract,

30:11.310 --> 30:12.643
no hormone secreting tumors.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.604
I'm not surprised.
What's more likely?

30:14.730 --> 30:17.732
Brother and sister get the same type
of tumor at exactly the same time,

30:17.858 --> 30:20.151
or they both play
in the same toxic sandbox?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.987
Yes, you would think that if for some
reason you were completely unaware

30:23.113 --> 30:25.531
of the fact we spent the entire night
testing everything from that home.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.366
It was all negative.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.452
You went home?

30:30.078 --> 30:32.330
Good for you. Delegate.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.540
We're not his subordinates.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.959
Making it all the more
impressive.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.503
What if it's genetic?

30:40.756 --> 30:43.216
Well, anyone else think it's
more than a coincidence

30:43.342 --> 30:45.968
these kids have symptoms that
could be caused by a brain tumor

30:46.094 --> 30:47.595
which is exactly
what killed their mom?

30:47.721 --> 30:49.388
You just said
there were no tumors.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.640
We scanned both their brains.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.016
They looked clean.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.559
So did their mom's,
until it didn't.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.187
It can't be genetic.
Mom had none of the same symptoms.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.566
Yes, she did, if the symptoms
were pubic hair and menstruation.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.027
That's ridiculous. If menstruation
is a symptom of brain cancer

31:03.153 --> 31:04.529
then I should be
on chemo right now.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.949
That's ridiculous. You're way
too skinny to be menstruating.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.450
What if the mom
had other problems?

31:09.576 --> 31:14.163
Symptoms her doctors ignored on account
of the fact she was already dying?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.250
Pull all her medical records.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.377
Find any similarities
to our patients.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.046
And punch the little brat on the nose
so he doesn't have a stroke

31:22.172 --> 31:24.715
like his sister.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.302
I'm not sick.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.887
Just trying to
keep you that way.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.473
I want Dr. Cameron to do mine.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.768
Trust me, you don't want her
cutting you right now.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.940
So Jasper's
behavioral issues...

31:41.233 --> 31:44.360
They could be a function
of the increased testosterone.

31:44.486 --> 31:47.655
Hopefully, he'll be a delight
as soon as we figure this out.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.699
My tummy hurts.

31:49.992 --> 31:50.950
It hurts!

31:51.076 --> 31:51.993
No, it doesn't.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.828
Don't be such a baby.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.079
My tummy hurts!

31:55.205 --> 31:58.124
- Where in your tummy?
- It hurts!

31:58.250 --> 32:00.042
It hurts!

32:04.965 --> 32:08.092
Stomach pain is from
a cyst in her pancreas.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.344
I found two more in her
kidneys and one in her lung.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.179
They weren't there
48 hours ago.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.432
Hormones are making
her body go haywire.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.393
She gets one in her brain
or heart, she's dead.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.271
No pressure, though.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.773
Her mom was perfectly healthy
until she got cancer.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.358
She had none of the symptoms
the kids have.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.278
It's not genetic,
it's not environmental.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.946
It's gotta be
a pituitary adenoma.

32:29.114 --> 32:32.033
Yes! That would make
complete sense if they had one.

32:32.159 --> 32:36.829
Just because we haven't found anything
on the scan doesn't mean it's not there.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.707
We should remove
her pituitary gland.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.876
Two siblings, same condition.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.377
It's gotta be genetic
or environmental.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.088
We add in the same time
and we're back to just environmental.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.341
Yes, and that would make complete sense
if there was anything

32:48.467 --> 32:49.300
in her environment.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.760
Just because we haven't
found anything yet...

32:50.886 --> 32:55.556
She's been out of her environment for
four days and she's still getting worse.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.269
I'm getting
the father's consent.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.896
No!

33:02.022 --> 33:03.606
We have no evidence.

33:03.732 --> 33:06.484
This is your process, House.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.279
You asked us
what two plus two is.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.991
We've eliminated every number
except for four.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.620
She needs brain surgery.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.208
The ovaries produce
sex hormones

33:22.334 --> 33:24.710
in response to a signal
from the pituitary gland.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.047
Since we know the ovaries are fine,
the most likely cause...

33:28.173 --> 33:32.259
"Most likely" means she wants to root
around inside your little girl's brain

33:32.719 --> 33:34.178
without any guarantee
that it'll work.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.430
That's why she's holding off
on doing your son.

33:36.556 --> 33:40.559
Dr. House knows that unfortunately we've
ruled out every other option.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.103
We need to resect
Lucy's pituitary before...

33:42.229 --> 33:43.562
Who else visits these kids?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.939
They don't have
any family in town.

33:45.065 --> 33:47.274
You got a girlfriend?

33:47.401 --> 33:48.818
- No one visits.
- School?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.695
They don't go to the same school.
House, I've covered...

33:50.821 --> 33:52.238
- Nanny?
- They don't have one.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.990
They go to after-school daycare
but none of the other kids are sick.

33:55.117 --> 33:56.283
Yet.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.869
It took your son twice as long
to develop symptoms as your daughter.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.329
Maybe the other kids
are just slow.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.248
We wait
and your daughter may die.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.582
She does this,
your daughter will need

34:03.709 --> 34:05.793
hormone replacement therapy
for the rest of her life.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.503
The treatments are extremely effective.

34:07.629 --> 34:09.422
She should lead
a relatively normal life.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.215
And isn't that
every parent's dream?

34:11.341 --> 34:14.844
To have a kid grow up to be
relatively normal?

34:21.017 --> 34:25.187
My husband died of thyroid cancer
that metastasized to his brain.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.733
I've been there.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.860
I know how terrifying
this can be.

34:30.986 --> 34:35.406
And I am telling you this is your best
chance to save your daughter's life.

34:39.369 --> 34:43.122
You did not just play
the dead husband card.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.585
My wife died.

34:47.711 --> 34:51.922
Because she signed a consent form that
I didn't want her to sign.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.257
Died.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.139
Thank you.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.770
How did you know?

35:06.897 --> 35:08.481
Know what?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.399
That the other kids
weren't sick?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.109
You've been here
for four days.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.611
I just...

35:15.113 --> 35:17.031
I would have heard.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.203
Right.

35:31.713 --> 35:34.089
Do you have hair
on your special place?

35:34.216 --> 35:35.883
Miss Janie!

35:37.302 --> 35:39.094
Can I help you?

35:39.221 --> 35:40.596
I'm a doctor.

35:40.722 --> 35:43.682
Two of your kids are sick
and I need to know why.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.893
You think they got sick here?

35:46.019 --> 35:48.229
I think
you're dating their dad.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.692
He told you?

35:53.819 --> 35:54.819
No.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.904
And I don't really care
why he didn't.

35:57.030 --> 35:59.615
I just need to know how often you go
to their house and what you bring.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.993
- I don't.
- Shampoos, fancy soaps...

36:03.119 --> 36:06.705
- Kids get in your bag.
- I've never been to their house.

36:08.208 --> 36:12.169
They just lost their mom
and we thought it was too soon.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.885
Why are you staring at me?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.136
Lip wax?

36:22.889 --> 36:25.057
I just had it done over lunch.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.309
- Mani-pedi?
- No.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.978
Just the wax.

36:30.313 --> 36:34.483
Women get a wax as a part of a whole
self-indulgent beauty ritual.

36:34.609 --> 36:37.528
Pedicures, steam,
cucumber masks.

36:37.654 --> 36:40.406
No one runs out at lunch
just to get a lip wax,

36:40.532 --> 36:43.367
unless you woke up looking
like Yosemite Sam.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.369
You're an ass.

36:46.580 --> 36:49.290
- Cameron.
- It's always the dad.

36:50.542 --> 36:55.462
Excess facial hair in women.
It's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.172
Exactly what
the little kiddies have.

36:57.299 --> 36:59.925
Is there something wrong
at the daycare center?

37:00.051 --> 37:03.053
There's something wrong
in your pants.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.480
She's a lot younger
than I am. I

37:14.441 --> 37:15.733
use a

37:16.234 --> 37:17.693
male enhancement cream
to keep up with her.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.028
What does this
have to do with...

37:19.154 --> 37:20.404
Never occurred to you
to get a prescription

37:20.530 --> 37:23.449
instead of some penis-pumper
loaded with testosterone?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.742
I keep it at the gym.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.578
I apply it daily in the shower
just like it says on the bottle.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.456
It's never been in my home,
it's obviously never been near the kids.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.540
But you have.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.835
We've been through that,
I'm not a pervert or a pedophile!

37:34.961 --> 37:38.464
Thirty percent of our waste
is excreted through our skin.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.507
That sounds high.

37:40.634 --> 37:42.384
It's why you stink
after eating garlic.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.679
Jack waters his beanstalk
every day for a week

37:45.805 --> 37:50.267
he's oozing bean curd
out of his pores for a month.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.061
Every time
you gave the little tykes a hug,

37:52.187 --> 37:54.188
you gave them a dose of testosterone.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.983
Small for you, but more than
their little bodies can handle.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.196
So...

38:03.198 --> 38:04.949
I did this to them?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.035
Just holding their hands?

38:08.495 --> 38:09.787
Uh-huh.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.795
If I stop using it?

38:18.922 --> 38:21.256
You'll be floppy,
they'll be fine.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.929
Give it back!

38:27.055 --> 38:28.764
He'll still be eight.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.702
You okay?

38:49.828 --> 38:51.036
Yeah, I think so.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.290
- Talk to Cuddy?
- No, not yet.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.501
I don't know what to say.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.087
Just be straight with her.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.631
I'm not sure what that is.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.677
I can't stop
thinking about her.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.055
In what way?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.807
Maybe she's right. Maybe...

39:12.142 --> 39:15.144
Maybe this is worth exploring.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.108
Are you sure that she feels...

39:21.234 --> 39:23.318
She sent me flowers.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.487
How do I do this?

39:25.989 --> 39:27.364
What do I say?

39:27.490 --> 39:31.243
Cameron would tell you
to say how you feel.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.495
Me? I'd get her drunk.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.875
I'm not gonna say anything.

39:38.001 --> 39:43.172
I'm just gonna walk into her office
and I'm gonna kiss her.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.219
That's a bold move.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.097
Cuddy likes bold.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.768
Yeah, you're right, if you spoke,
you'd just say something stupid.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.229
Yeah, I mean I'll either
get a girlfriend or get fired.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.363
Okay.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.075
Yeah. Okay.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.496
Okay.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.049
You! You! You!

40:27.175 --> 40:29.176
You were gonna let me do that?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.512
You made
a compelling argument.

40:31.721 --> 40:32.888
You sent those flowers to me!

40:33.056 --> 40:36.225
Yes! Because you
took her to a play.

40:36.351 --> 40:39.186
And because, actually, you do wanna
march down there and kiss her.

40:39.312 --> 40:40.312
No! I don't.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.480
Yes, you do.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.360
You're right.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.321
Seriously?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.365
No.

40:52.325 --> 40:53.450
You're a jerk.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.287
- Night, Wilson.
- Night, House.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.067
They're beautiful.

41:35.076 --> 41:37.953
I thought about what you said.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.288
And

41:40.999 --> 41:43.792
I really don't want
a relationship with you.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.295
I know.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.006
I also know you like flowers.

42:12.697 --> 42:16.241
I don't get the whole
May-December thing.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.578
Give him a break.
May-October at worst.

42:19.704 --> 42:22.289
Well, why can't it be
October-October?

42:22.415 --> 42:25.000
May is when
things start to get hot.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.753
If that guy wasn't trying
so hard

42:27.879 --> 42:29.338
to keep up
with a woman half his age,

42:29.464 --> 42:32.007
he wouldn't have
almost killed both his kids.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.134
Guy gets a little
something-something,

42:34.260 --> 42:37.262
couple of kids
have to die... Circle of life.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.181
So many people,

42:39.307 --> 42:40.933
so much energy and drama

42:41.059 --> 42:44.645
just trying to find someone who's almost
never the right person anyway.

42:44.771 --> 42:48.690
It just shouldn't be so hard.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.365
I got tickets to a play.
