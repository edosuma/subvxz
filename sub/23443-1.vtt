18:09.588 --> 18:10.672

18:31.985 --> 18:33.862

Otherwise, all I can think
about is Lori's perfume.

It's to scare away

19:00.222 --> 19:03.475

She must have figured out

19:03.559 --> 19:04.852

Okay, no.
What's up?

- Someone's going to have to
interrupt Lola's beauty sleep

19:15.320 --> 19:17.281

- But she needs

19:17.364 --> 19:20.534

- Or else she can't

19:20.617 --> 19:23.328

We need your help

19:39.261 --> 19:40.721

19:46.852 --> 19:49.605

miserably.

had no idea

would be this hard.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.818
Please, tell us your secret.

It's just hard work

19:57.696 --> 20:00.115
and discipline.
- Well, I'm out.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.034
{\an3}- It's too late for discipline,
but can you teach us

20:02.117 --> 20:03.744
how to do the hard work part?

20:03.827 --> 20:09.333
