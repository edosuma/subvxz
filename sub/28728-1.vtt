01:58.808 --> 02:01.074
Honey, quit picking at it.

02:01.076 --> 02:02.907
Are you nervous or what?

02:02.909 --> 02:05.707
Yeah, a little.
It's a pretty big school.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.841
Well, first days
are always a little goofy,

02:07.843 --> 02:10.541
but you and I
are gonna be fine.

02:10.543 --> 02:12.909
We are modern babes
in a modern world.

02:12.911 --> 02:15.809
Oh, my God, how am I
related to you?

02:50.817 --> 02:53.082
Hey. Do you need some help?

02:53.084 --> 02:56.749
Um, yeah. Maybe.

02:56.751 --> 02:57.950
It didn't charge right
last night,

02:57.952 --> 02:59.849
- so it's low on juice.
- Here. Hold up.

02:59.851 --> 03:01.886
- Let me get you.
- Oh.

03:04.519 --> 03:06.985
So, which way are you headed?

03:06.987 --> 03:09.518
All I needed was a push.
It should be enough.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.954
Oh. Okay.

03:11.987 --> 03:14.086
Thanks for being so nice.

03:14.088 --> 03:17.752
- You're a lifesaver.
- Yeah. You, too.

03:17.754 --> 03:19.455
"You, too"?

03:23.722 --> 03:26.921
You are Erica. I am Stu.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.754
We are now coworkers.

03:28.756 --> 03:31.056
Nice to meet you, Stu.

03:31.058 --> 03:32.889
How's your first day
on the floor going?

03:32.891 --> 03:35.722
Is it everything you ever
dreamed of and so much more?

03:35.724 --> 03:38.589
Sure beats having a desk job.

03:49.593 --> 03:52.125
Okay...

03:52.127 --> 03:55.561
Okay.

04:07.596 --> 04:09.628
You do have a nice ass.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.695
I noticed it this morning.
I'm very perceptive.

04:11.697 --> 04:12.929
I'm not, like...

04:12.931 --> 04:14.929
a lesbian or anything.

04:14.931 --> 04:17.529
You're new, on a Friday,

04:17.531 --> 04:19.762
in February,
which is very weird.

04:19.765 --> 04:20.997
Military brat?

04:20.999 --> 04:22.697
Uh, no.

04:22.699 --> 04:24.731
Uh, yeah, I'm Maggie.

04:24.733 --> 04:25.998
Today's my first day.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.031
- I transferred.
- That sucks.

04:28.033 --> 04:30.131
- I was new last year, so I get it.
- Mm.

04:30.133 --> 04:32.068
Um...

05:02.661 --> 05:04.660
Stephanie, are you still
having people over

05:04.662 --> 05:05.693
for a party tomorrow?

05:05.695 --> 05:07.093
- Yeah.
- Cool.

05:07.095 --> 05:09.296
You can come with us
if you want.

05:10.863 --> 05:13.227
- Haley.
- Yeah.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.495
Thanks. I'm going to
the music festival with my mom.

05:15.497 --> 05:16.862
So...

05:16.864 --> 05:18.462
Okay.

05:18.464 --> 05:21.496
Damn, a lot of people
would kill to be so popular.

05:21.498 --> 05:23.396
- Okay.
- Have fun with your mom

05:23.398 --> 05:25.563
and all those
fucking old people.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.066
Shit.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.234
Shit, shit.

05:42.201 --> 05:44.635
Shit.

05:45.669 --> 05:47.467
Hey, what's wrong?

05:47.469 --> 05:49.867
Well, nothing. I'm just...

05:49.869 --> 05:52.568
I have to cover
for somebody now at work.

05:52.570 --> 05:55.535
What about the music festival?

05:55.537 --> 05:58.269
Well, there's not much
I can do about it, honey.

05:58.271 --> 06:01.702
I'm the new kid,
and we got to make money, so...

06:01.704 --> 06:04.570
I made you some pancakes.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.870
All right, I'll text you
a little later, okay?

06:07.872 --> 06:09.504
Bye.

06:41.144 --> 06:42.409
Whoo!

06:42.411 --> 06:43.676
Maggie came to party.

06:43.678 --> 06:45.677
Maggie came to party.

06:45.679 --> 06:46.677
Get in. Go.

06:46.679 --> 06:48.377
Faster, faster. Boys...

06:48.379 --> 06:49.477
Maggie.

06:49.479 --> 06:50.677
- Yo, what's up?
- Maggie, boys.

06:50.679 --> 06:52.344
How you doing, Maggie?

06:52.346 --> 06:54.311
Oh, you-you might know me.
I'm Darrell.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.578
- Okay.
- That's Andy.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.512
- Hi.
- And this gay dude is Chaz.

06:57.514 --> 06:59.445
- Yeah, I'm-I'm very straight.
- HALEY and DARRELL: Super gay.

06:59.447 --> 07:01.445
- I love pussy. Babe, tell 'em.
- Super gay.

07:01.447 --> 07:03.580
- Tell 'em I love pussy, babe.
- So, the party's canceled.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.146
Stephanie's mom's
a complete bitch.

07:05.148 --> 07:06.446
And I think
we're just gonna, like,

07:06.448 --> 07:07.547
drive around and get drunk.

07:07.549 --> 07:08.713
- Okay.
- Is that cool?

07:08.715 --> 07:10.147
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Very cool.

07:10.149 --> 07:11.481
- Are you sure?
- Super cool.

07:11.483 --> 07:12.681
- Great.
- All right, let's do it.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.315
Let's get drunk!

07:22.351 --> 07:24.249
Hey, hey, mister, uh,
can you, uh...

07:24.251 --> 07:26.316
Yup. Nah.

07:28.452 --> 07:30.217
Literally looks like
he's gonna throw up.

07:30.219 --> 07:32.119
Dude always looks like that.

07:34.654 --> 07:36.385
Want a drag?

07:36.387 --> 07:38.184
It's cotton candy.

07:38.186 --> 07:40.419
- No, I'm good.
- What, you don't vape?

07:40.421 --> 07:41.686
- No.
- Come on, you're in high school.

07:41.688 --> 07:43.586
You can smoke
as much as you want

07:43.588 --> 07:46.253
until you're 25 and then quit,
and nothing bad will happen.

07:48.689 --> 07:50.287
Here we go.

07:50.289 --> 07:52.388
- Hey, sir, can you, uh...
- Piss off, boy.

07:54.189 --> 07:56.555
He's too desperate about it.

07:56.557 --> 07:59.322
Hey, yo, man,
this shit racist out here.

07:59.324 --> 08:00.589
- Your turn.
- Nope. Not me.

08:00.591 --> 08:02.489
The guy that works here
knows my stepdad.

08:02.491 --> 08:03.890
I vote Maggie.

08:03.892 --> 08:06.223
She's new,
and no one knows who she is.

08:06.225 --> 08:09.124
And truthfully, you could be
a narc, and that scares me.

08:09.126 --> 08:11.658
Look, if the cops come,
just cry. They'll let you off.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.424
What? They never let me off.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.525
Yeah, 'cause they know
you nasty.

08:15.527 --> 08:18.325
Darrell.

08:18.327 --> 08:20.659
Mm-hmm.

08:20.661 --> 08:24.293
- Hi. Excuse me. Could...
- Get lost.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.193
Hey.

08:27.195 --> 08:28.427
Be more confident.

08:28.429 --> 08:30.427
Hey, what you got for me?

08:30.429 --> 08:31.694
- Hey, come on.
- Uh-uh.

08:31.696 --> 08:33.294
Not today. Not today.

08:33.297 --> 08:34.462
Come on, sweetie.

08:36.297 --> 08:38.227
Come on.

08:38.230 --> 08:40.131
Got to do one more lap.

08:41.664 --> 08:43.696
- Um...
- Come on.

08:43.698 --> 08:46.130
- Excuse me? Hi.
- Yeah?

08:46.132 --> 08:48.597
Um, would you mind buying this
for my friends and I?

08:48.599 --> 08:50.330
I have money for it.

08:50.332 --> 08:52.331
Not interested, kid.

08:52.333 --> 08:55.698
- Come on.
- I know it's... I know it's weird, but please?

08:55.700 --> 08:57.532
You want to spend the night
in jail?

08:57.534 --> 08:59.632
Does that sound fun to you?

08:59.634 --> 09:01.265
The fuck?

09:01.267 --> 09:03.466
- Andy, can we just go?
- Yeah, let's roll. Yeah.

09:03.468 --> 09:05.068
Sorry.

09:05.735 --> 09:08.600
Oh.

09:08.602 --> 09:10.603
Okay.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.267
Now I see what's going on.

09:14.269 --> 09:17.468
A man sending a girl
to do his dirty work.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.201
Guys, I used to do

09:19.203 --> 09:20.602
the same thing
when I was your age.

09:20.604 --> 09:22.236
We're sorry.

09:22.238 --> 09:24.269
Could you hook us up, though?

09:24.271 --> 09:27.571
Mm. I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

09:27.573 --> 09:29.304
if you got into an accident.

09:29.306 --> 09:30.671
Oh, well, I'm driving,
and I don't drink.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.571
We were just gonna go to
the rock pile for a little bit.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.572
I promise. Just...

09:33.574 --> 09:35.138
Mm.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.705
I know where that is.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.606
Shoot.

09:38.608 --> 09:42.274
We used to hang out there
all the time when I was a kid.

09:52.443 --> 09:55.374
Hell. Hold this dog.

09:55.376 --> 09:57.442
Yes!

09:57.444 --> 09:58.709
And don't tell.

09:58.711 --> 10:00.611
No.

10:03.245 --> 10:05.412
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Sue Ann.

10:08.211 --> 10:10.911
Hey, y'all know dogs kill
more people than sharks, right?

10:10.913 --> 10:13.444
That's great, Darrell.
Thank you.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.345
What?

10:15.347 --> 10:17.612
Whoo! There's my girl.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.713
Okay. They didn't have
whatever Fireball is,

10:20.715 --> 10:22.613
so I got After Shock.

10:22.615 --> 10:24.179
- Yeah.
- Man said it's the same thing.

10:24.181 --> 10:25.613
This never happened, okay?

10:25.615 --> 10:27.347
- Whoop.
- Thanks again for doing this, ma'am.

10:27.349 --> 10:29.681
For doing what, darling?

10:29.683 --> 10:31.581
Come on, baby.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.617
Come on, sweetie.

10:35.917 --> 10:37.715
Yo, that old chick wants
to sit on your face, dude.

10:37.717 --> 10:40.516
- What, you think so?
- Like, your entire face.

10:44.318 --> 10:46.150
- Smash her back.
- Dude, I don't know.

10:46.152 --> 10:48.350
- Oh, come on. Guys.
- That's not really...

10:48.352 --> 10:51.618
All right,
I would... I would smash.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.384
- Hey. - CHAZ: Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.718
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.552
Your change.
I'm not some thug.

10:58.554 --> 11:00.919
No, of course not. Thanks.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.655
- Thanks again.
- Drive safe.

11:18.724 --> 11:20.422
Sue Ann!

11:20.424 --> 11:22.425
Go clean out the kennels!

11:27.626 --> 11:29.624
Bingo.

11:29.626 --> 11:32.490
Oh, hey, could you
get me some lunch first?

11:40.194 --> 11:41.759
All right, someone start
the fire, assholes. Let's go.

11:41.761 --> 11:43.259
Let's all get shit-faced.

11:46.162 --> 11:48.160
Seems pretty secluded.

11:48.162 --> 11:49.560
Yeah, sadly,
this is pretty much

11:49.562 --> 11:51.394
the best drinking spot in town.

11:51.396 --> 11:53.628
So, when did you get here?
From where?

11:53.630 --> 11:55.695
From San Diego,
like a week ago.

11:55.697 --> 11:57.295
Oh, yeah. That's, uh...

11:57.297 --> 11:58.495
that's enough time to realize

11:58.497 --> 12:00.529
there's nothing to do
in this town.

12:00.531 --> 12:02.162
It sucks.

12:02.164 --> 12:03.296
- Sorry. I'll stop.
- Thanks.

12:03.298 --> 12:04.763
You live here now.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.730
It's not the worst.

12:06.732 --> 12:10.698
Kind of just like
anywhere else.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.433
Not anymore.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.632
Guys, what are you doing?

12:16.634 --> 12:18.467
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on, man.

12:36.637 --> 12:39.471
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

12:41.738 --> 12:44.402
Yes, hello? This is Ben.

12:44.404 --> 12:47.303
Um, Ben Hawkins?

12:47.305 --> 12:49.270
Hawkins Security?

12:49.272 --> 12:51.538
Yes. Who is this?

12:51.540 --> 12:54.938
A young man you know
just might be drinking booze

12:54.940 --> 12:57.372
with his friends
out at the rock piles.

12:57.374 --> 12:59.939
And who might I know?

12:59.941 --> 13:01.939
Andy.

13:01.941 --> 13:04.239
Okay. Who am I speaking to?

13:04.241 --> 13:06.573
A little birdie.

13:06.575 --> 13:08.541
Sue Ann?

13:08.543 --> 13:11.207
- Why isn't this dog prepped?
- Oh, I-I just...

13:11.209 --> 13:12.407
You know what? I don't want
to see you anymore today.

13:12.409 --> 13:14.407
Go. You go home,
and I'll prep this dog.

13:14.409 --> 13:16.241
Do it myself.

13:16.243 --> 13:18.508
And stay off your damn phone.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.244
Sit.

13:27.379 --> 13:29.544
No, no, no, no.
No. No, no.

13:29.546 --> 13:31.744
Ow.

13:31.746 --> 13:34.511
Shit.

13:36.313 --> 13:37.945
Don't dab.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.479
I don't think
you should dab anymore.

13:39.481 --> 13:40.546
Yeah.

13:40.548 --> 13:42.179
Maggie.

13:42.181 --> 13:43.679
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

13:43.681 --> 13:46.480
- You got to try this. It's my favorite.
- Okay. Okay.

13:46.482 --> 13:47.714
Oh, you don't have to
if you don't want to.

13:47.716 --> 13:49.413
- No, no, I want to.
- No, she has to.

13:49.415 --> 13:50.548
- Okay.
- I have to.

13:50.550 --> 13:53.214
Take a sip. Take a sip.

13:53.216 --> 13:55.715
Oh, my God.

13:55.717 --> 13:57.616
- Hell yeah. It's very strong.
- It's fucking strong.

13:57.618 --> 14:00.248
- - Fuck.
- Oh, fuck, that's a cop.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.115
- Andy, where's the weed?
- What? Okay, wait.

14:01.117 --> 14:03.283
- I got the weed. Okay.
- Put it away.

14:03.285 --> 14:04.783
- Let's go, let's go.
- Do I hide? - Shh, shh.

14:04.785 --> 14:05.717
No! Maggie! Come here.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.950
- No? I don't hide?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:06.952 --> 14:09.484
- Okay.
- You're-you're a girl. He's not gonna do anything.

14:09.486 --> 14:11.217
- You're fine. Shh.
- My mom's gonna fucking kill me

14:11.219 --> 14:12.651
- if I go to prison.
- Act cute. Act cute. Act...

14:12.653 --> 14:14.518
Come on out.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.485
- Oh, oh, okay, sir.
- I said get out here!

14:16.487 --> 14:18.218
- I-I'm sorry.
- Come on! Right now!

14:18.220 --> 14:19.518
- Okay.
- You, too, bud.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.421
Come on. Get out here.

14:24.455 --> 14:26.319
I just got a phone call
from somebody,

14:26.321 --> 14:27.621
telling me that there were
some teenagers

14:27.623 --> 14:29.623
drinking out at the rock piles.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.555
You seen anybody out here,
young lady?

14:32.557 --> 14:35.755
- Sir, we don't have any...
- Wrong young lady.

14:35.757 --> 14:37.622
Put your arms out.
Put 'em out!

14:37.624 --> 14:40.391
- Wide. Back up. Move back.
- Mm.

14:48.525 --> 14:50.560
Your daddy sent me out here
to arrest you.

14:55.493 --> 14:59.359
I played football with your dad
in high school.

14:59.361 --> 15:00.759
And he's a dick.

15:00.761 --> 15:03.360
So...

15:03.362 --> 15:05.560
I'm gonna come back
in ten minutes,

15:05.562 --> 15:08.427
and all your shit out here
is gonna be gone. You got it?

15:08.429 --> 15:09.494
- Yep. - Yeah, I-I got it.
- Do you?

15:09.496 --> 15:10.661
- Yeah, I think... - Yes.
- All right, get your shit,

15:10.663 --> 15:11.661
and let's get out of here.

15:11.663 --> 15:13.396
- Okay.
- Right now.

15:15.197 --> 15:16.729
So, I want to go home.

15:16.731 --> 15:17.829
How is that funny?

15:17.831 --> 15:19.662
- Dude! How did...
- We would have been

15:19.664 --> 15:21.465
shot the fuck up.

15:24.765 --> 15:26.631
Shit.

15:26.633 --> 15:29.332
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:35.266 --> 15:36.765
You smell like pot.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.399
I didn't smoke anything.

15:39.401 --> 15:41.265
Who were you with?

15:41.267 --> 15:43.532
Just some kids from school.
I-I left you a note.

15:43.534 --> 15:45.400
Yeah, you leave a note
when you're up to something.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.734
Why didn't you just text me?

15:46.736 --> 15:48.667
Uh, I don't know.
My phone died.

15:48.669 --> 15:50.501
We just drove around.

15:50.503 --> 15:53.401
- And you got high. Maggie.
- I didn't smoke anything.

15:53.403 --> 15:55.401
And they asked me just
to go out, so I said okay.

15:55.403 --> 15:56.535
It's really not
that big a deal.

15:56.537 --> 15:57.769
I'm not gonna be
some fucking loser

15:57.771 --> 15:59.502
and tell them not to smoke
'cause I don't.

15:59.504 --> 16:01.268
Do not talk to me like that.

16:01.270 --> 16:03.703
- Come back here.
- Why should I wait around for you

16:03.705 --> 16:06.236
while you're at work all day?
How is that fair?

16:06.238 --> 16:09.371
I'm glad you're fitting in.
I really am.

16:09.373 --> 16:12.404
I want you to make
smarter decisions than that.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.307
Like all the amazing decisions
you've made.

16:21.408 --> 16:23.239
Hi.

16:23.241 --> 16:26.741
I'm Erica. Uh, I'm dropping
this boy off for shots.

16:26.743 --> 16:28.240
This is Louie.

16:28.242 --> 16:30.240
Well, you're right
on time, Erica.

16:30.242 --> 16:32.240
Actually, I'm running late
for work.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.274
Can I just fill this out later?

16:34.276 --> 16:36.477
Oh, yeah, just-just sign the
bottom, and I'll do the rest.

16:38.578 --> 16:40.776
- Thank you.
- Mm.

16:48.979 --> 16:51.578
Sue Ann.

16:51.580 --> 16:54.211
Sue Ann!

16:54.213 --> 16:56.545
Answer the fucking...

16:56.547 --> 16:58.412
Brooks Veterinary.

16:58.414 --> 17:02.212
Yeah, hold on, Mrs. Macy.
We'll get your file.

17:02.214 --> 17:04.548
Why aren't you
answering the phones?

17:06.548 --> 17:09.247
Sorry.
I'm fighting a migraine.

17:09.249 --> 17:10.414
Well, go get
some horse tranquilizer.

17:10.415 --> 17:11.681
I don't care. Do your job.

17:13.415 --> 17:16.250
Come on, boy. Come on.

17:21.685 --> 17:23.750
I'm marathoning
John Hughes movies,

17:23.752 --> 17:24.983
if you want to hang.

17:24.984 --> 17:26.983
Have you seen <i>Pretty in Pink?</i>

17:26.986 --> 17:29.217
Well, no, I'm hanging out
with Haley, remember?

17:29.219 --> 17:30.419
Oh, yeah.

17:31.819 --> 17:34.318
You look like
you're going to see a boy.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.218
Are you going to meet a boy?

17:36.220 --> 17:37.785
- No.
- No?

17:37.787 --> 17:39.986
We're-we're just friends.

17:41.421 --> 17:43.285
Okay, well, be smart,
and call me

17:43.287 --> 17:45.620
if you need me to come get you.
I won't be mad.

17:45.622 --> 17:47.387
- Promise?
- Promise.

17:47.389 --> 17:48.787
- Okay.
- Okay, I love you.

17:48.789 --> 17:51.256
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

17:59.591 --> 18:02.390
Yo, why the fuck is she
putting it in her truck?

18:02.392 --> 18:03.990
Oh, I bet it smell
like ass in there, too.

18:03.992 --> 18:05.456
Guys.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.523
Oh, here she comes,
here she comes.

18:07.525 --> 18:10.824
Okay. I got two bottles
of Parrot Bay,

18:10.826 --> 18:12.591
uh, 18-pack of Bud Light,

18:12.593 --> 18:15.225
- and they had the Fireball this time.
- Ah, sweet.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.725
- Thank you.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:17.727 --> 18:21.326
Why don't you just, uh,
follow me down the street,

18:21.328 --> 18:23.459
and you can pay me
and get the stuff.

18:23.461 --> 18:25.760
I got eyes on me.
I don't want to lose my job.

18:25.762 --> 18:27.327
Cool. Yeah, I'll follow you.

18:27.329 --> 18:28.827
Secret hand-offs?

18:28.829 --> 18:32.230
Are you freaking kidding me
right now? Fuck yes!

18:37.830 --> 18:39.629
Okay.

18:39.631 --> 18:42.329
I feel like she really
doesn't want to get caught.

18:42.331 --> 18:45.298
It wouldn't be so bad
if she didn't drive so slow.

19:03.568 --> 19:05.000
- This place is creepy.
- All right.

19:05.002 --> 19:06.769
- This is fucking sketchy.
- No, it's good.

19:12.536 --> 19:15.502
No, I think she wants to
bang him for real.

19:15.504 --> 19:17.301
Oh, shut up.

19:17.303 --> 19:18.368
What, are you jealous, Maggie?
You jealous?

19:18.370 --> 19:20.236
Shh, shh, shh.
Wait, he's talking to her.

19:20.238 --> 19:21.605
He's... Shh.

19:23.304 --> 19:24.403
Did you give her the money?

19:24.405 --> 19:25.336
Uh, well, kind of.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.771
She said we could hang out
in her basement

19:26.773 --> 19:28.504
if we didn't want
to drive around all night.

19:28.506 --> 19:31.570
I didn't know what to say.

19:31.572 --> 19:33.672
I mean, I'm down.
I got to pee really bad.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.438
No. No, no, no, no.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.304
We don't, we don't know
this chick, so...

19:37.306 --> 19:38.572
- No.
- No cops, though.

19:38.574 --> 19:40.341
What do you think?

19:41.741 --> 19:43.472
Okay.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.440
- Whoa! - Aah!
- Yes!

19:45.442 --> 19:47.340
- Okay...
- All right, let's go!

19:47.342 --> 19:49.507
- Are y'all serious?
- Yes! Get out.

19:49.509 --> 19:51.841
- I got to pee!
- Whoo! Fuck yeah.

19:51.843 --> 19:53.574
You guys come on in.

19:53.576 --> 19:54.841
Come on in.

19:54.843 --> 19:57.642
It calms me down so much
to know

19:57.644 --> 20:00.242
that you guys aren't out there
drinking and driving.

20:00.244 --> 20:02.443
I mean, to be honest,
I would rather you be safe.

20:02.445 --> 20:03.576
If you're gonna do it
somewhere,

20:03.578 --> 20:04.743
might as well be here, right?

20:04.745 --> 20:06.543
Do you have a bathroom
I can use?

20:06.545 --> 20:08.644
It ain't much,
but it's all you.

20:08.646 --> 20:10.678
- Thanks.
- Okay.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.778
The bar is open.

20:12.780 --> 20:15.545
Wow. Nobody's been
down here a minute.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.812
- Ugh.
- Weird, though.

20:17.814 --> 20:20.346
Oh, that's nasty.

20:24.314 --> 20:26.514
Is it just me,
or is it cold in here?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.747
Yo, this place smells like

20:27.749 --> 20:29.683
my great-grandmother's house.

20:31.716 --> 20:33.682
Jesus Christ.

20:33.684 --> 20:35.682
Okay, everybody,
listen up real quick.

20:35.684 --> 20:37.715
My only house rules are:

20:37.717 --> 20:40.549
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- Sorry.

20:40.551 --> 20:42.749
And don't spit
on my floors, please.

20:42.751 --> 20:44.850
Oh, and you...
I'm gonna need your keys.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.650
You got to check in with me
before walking out that door,

20:47.652 --> 20:49.417
'cause I got to know
you're safe to drive.

20:49.419 --> 20:50.618
Cool. Yeah. Fine.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.518
Okay, oh,
and nobody go upstairs.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.351
That's my world,
and right now it's a mess.

20:55.353 --> 20:56.852
So, uh, you guys are free to do

20:56.854 --> 20:59.285
whatever you want to do
down here, but, you know...

20:59.287 --> 21:00.452
Hell yeah...

21:00.454 --> 21:02.253
Heck yeah.

21:02.255 --> 21:03.353
Thanks, lady.

21:03.355 --> 21:04.853
I'll get you some cups and ice.

21:04.855 --> 21:06.720
Uh, excuse me.

21:06.722 --> 21:08.554
What's your name?

21:08.556 --> 21:10.621
Sue Ann.
What's yours?

21:10.623 --> 21:14.755
Darrell. That's, uh, Andy,
Chaz, Haley and Maggie.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.355
You got any Pizza Rolls, Ma?

21:17.357 --> 21:19.655
"Ma"?

21:19.657 --> 21:21.856
Boy, you are too much.

21:21.858 --> 21:23.556
I'll get you some snacks.

21:23.558 --> 21:25.523
Go ahead and, uh,
make yourselves at home.

21:25.525 --> 21:27.424
Guys, this is so sick.

21:28.726 --> 21:31.323
Oh, my God.

21:45.696 --> 21:47.696
Mmm.

21:51.363 --> 21:52.861
- Oh, if it's personal...
- Oh, that's gangster, bro.

21:52.863 --> 21:53.795
No, no, it's fine.

21:53.797 --> 21:55.761
Um, my dad left my mom
for someone else,

21:55.763 --> 21:58.595
and I don't think she really
had anywhere else to go.

21:58.597 --> 22:00.362
Oh, you guys are cute.

22:00.364 --> 22:02.598
Eee. It's nice.

22:07.598 --> 22:09.831
- Okay.
- Oh, that's a lot.

22:09.833 --> 22:13.264
- Here we go. Oh.
- Bro, you are not good at those tricks, dawg.

22:13.266 --> 22:15.465
I had Pizza Rolls, Darrell.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.832
This place could be incredible.

22:17.834 --> 22:20.700
You know what you need?
Okay, hear me out.

22:20.702 --> 22:22.666
Couch there.

22:22.668 --> 22:23.866
Snack wall, bam.

22:23.868 --> 22:25.499
Maybe, like,
a projector situation

22:25.501 --> 22:28.367
going on over here,
hang weird lights.

22:28.369 --> 22:30.467
Speakers over there,
rugs all on here,

22:30.469 --> 22:33.268
and then just, like, a real
table for flip cup, beer pong.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.735
You get it.

22:34.737 --> 22:37.368
I'll get right on that
as soon as I win the lottery.

22:37.370 --> 22:39.602
Then I can turn this place
into the Taj Mahal.

22:39.604 --> 22:41.271
I mean, unless you hate
being cool.

22:43.771 --> 22:46.704
If you don't want to be cool,
that's on you.

22:46.706 --> 22:48.338
Just saying.

22:50.373 --> 22:52.337
You want to see something cool?

22:52.339 --> 22:53.339
Sure.

22:59.574 --> 23:01.372
Pretty cool, huh?

23:01.374 --> 23:02.542
Oh, shit.

23:03.575 --> 23:05.208
Strip.

23:06.308 --> 23:07.475
Get naked, boy.

23:23.812 --> 23:25.445
Oh, my God.

23:45.348 --> 23:48.513
You are under arrest
for being so dang cute.

23:48.515 --> 23:50.815
Put that thing away.

23:50.817 --> 23:53.614
- And I'll put this thing away.
- Oh, my God.

23:53.616 --> 23:55.381
That-that was insane.

23:55.383 --> 23:56.749
This thing doesn't even work.

23:56.751 --> 23:58.515
I found it
when I was moving in.

23:58.517 --> 23:59.615
What, y'all think I'm Madea?

23:59.617 --> 24:00.716
- Here, take it.
- Uh-uh. - No.

24:00.718 --> 24:03.349
- Toss it in a pond, for all I care.
- No, it's okay.

24:03.351 --> 24:04.550
Pretty cool, huh?

24:05.752 --> 24:08.584
Ma, you fucking got me.

24:08.586 --> 24:10.051
Are we cool?

24:10.053 --> 24:11.751
We'll see.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.885
You fucking scared
the shit out of me.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.685
- I-I think I got to puke.
- She did.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.552
We need to get
this one outside.

24:19.554 --> 24:21.753
Ma, all I...
I just need some pizza.

24:21.755 --> 24:23.586
And you need a breath mint.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.222
You got him?

24:29.056 --> 24:31.353
Thanks for having us over,
Sue Ann.

24:31.355 --> 24:33.423
Oh, look at me.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.388
Okay, follow my fingers.

24:37.390 --> 24:39.322
Don't mess it up.

24:40.758 --> 24:42.756
You're married?

24:42.758 --> 24:45.557
Uh, he left years ago.

24:45.559 --> 24:48.490
My finger's too fat
to get it off, so...

24:48.492 --> 24:49.625
Thanks.

24:50.827 --> 24:52.825
It was nice to meet you.

24:52.827 --> 24:54.758
And hey, thanks
for letting us hang out.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.759
Oh, please.
I haven't had this much fun

24:56.761 --> 24:58.625
in God knows how long.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.792
Get home safe.

25:00.794 --> 25:02.795
That's all I care about.

25:04.729 --> 25:06.359
A large sausage pizza.

25:06.361 --> 25:07.693
A large sausage pizza?

25:07.695 --> 25:10.761
Now you know
where the party is.

25:20.331 --> 25:22.362
We're headed back
to the rock piles tonight,

25:22.364 --> 25:23.763
if you want to come.

25:23.765 --> 25:25.496
Oh.

25:25.498 --> 25:26.764
We'll just drink a few beers,
whatever.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.731
Well, that sounds cool.

25:28.733 --> 25:30.363
- Thanks.
- Yeah?

25:30.365 --> 25:32.433
- See y'all tonight.
- Mm.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.567
It'll be fun.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.768
Yeah.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.668
Oh, you're good, honey.

25:52.670 --> 25:55.301
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, it was cool.

25:55.303 --> 25:56.804
It was no big deal.

26:58.781 --> 27:01.645
So, you just balance it out.
You find your center.

27:01.647 --> 27:03.613
- Okay.
- And then you go.

27:03.615 --> 27:05.513
That's how... One more...

27:05.515 --> 27:07.848
No, I'm not giving 'em
back to you.

27:07.850 --> 27:09.481
That is bullshit.

27:09.483 --> 27:11.647
- Yes.
- Oh, wait. Excuse me.

27:11.649 --> 27:13.614
- Those aren't for you.
- Take those.

27:13.616 --> 27:15.482
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

27:15.484 --> 27:17.882
Erica fucking Thompson?

27:17.884 --> 27:20.483
Mercedes, hi.

27:20.485 --> 27:21.616
What are you doing here?

27:21.618 --> 27:23.649
Uh, didn't you, like,
go to California or something,

27:23.651 --> 27:26.550
and, like, you were gonna,
like, make it?

27:26.552 --> 27:27.784
Well, I did.

27:27.786 --> 27:30.517
I got married,
I moved to California,

27:30.519 --> 27:32.818
and my marriage didn't make it.

27:32.820 --> 27:35.384
I understand
yours didn't, either.

27:35.386 --> 27:37.384
Fuck no, right? No, thank God.

27:37.386 --> 27:38.586
I'm so happy.

27:38.588 --> 27:40.452
- Look who's here. Hey.
- Oh.

27:40.454 --> 27:42.352
- It's Erica Thompson.
- Hi, Ben.

27:42.354 --> 27:44.487
- It's fucking Erica Thompson.
- Oh, hey.

27:44.489 --> 27:46.420
- You look nice.
- You, too.

27:46.422 --> 27:48.589
You're not working here,
are you?

27:49.790 --> 27:52.387
No, I just want
to wear this every day

27:52.389 --> 27:54.521
and-and, um, help the bar out.

27:54.523 --> 27:56.789
Can I please have
the two glasses back?

27:56.791 --> 27:57.922
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

27:57.924 --> 28:00.689
You, like, left, and then
you had to come back here?

28:00.691 --> 28:01.723
That is so sad.

28:01.725 --> 28:03.356
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God, no...

28:03.358 --> 28:04.690
Um, I'm gonna need you
to leave, please.

28:04.692 --> 28:06.090
Hey, don't you fucking
touch me, Mario.

28:06.092 --> 28:08.091
- No.
- If you don't get her out, I will. Come on.

28:08.093 --> 28:09.158
- No, I'll take that.
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.758
- All right. Okay. Hey, Mercedes.
- Oh, oh, okay.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.390
- Hey, hey, let go of me.
- Mercedes, come on.

28:12.392 --> 28:13.390
You're not drinking anymore.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.458
- I'm gonna have that.
- Come on, let's just...

28:14.460 --> 28:16.092
- Mercedes, come on.
- Yeah, you left

28:16.094 --> 28:18.692
- my fucking bag on the table.
- Come on.

28:18.694 --> 28:19.793
- Come on, Mercedes.
- Thanks for taking my drink.

28:19.795 --> 28:21.392
- Come on. Come on. Come on, please go.
- Fuck off.

28:21.394 --> 28:22.426
Come on, guys.

28:22.428 --> 28:23.860
Nice seeing you, Erica.

28:23.862 --> 28:25.426
I'll see you.

28:37.630 --> 28:39.529
I think I got
everything I need.

28:39.531 --> 28:40.763
Oh, hi, Stu.

28:40.765 --> 28:42.662
- Hi. Oh, hi.
- Meet Maggie.

28:42.664 --> 28:44.463
- Hi. Hi.
- Stu is who I work with,

28:44.465 --> 28:45.897
- and we're doing the seminar.
- So nice to meet you.

28:45.899 --> 28:47.897
- You, too.
- Hello.

28:47.899 --> 28:49.630
Oh, Mom, you look great.

28:49.632 --> 28:51.798
Oh, thanks.
I never know how dressy to get

28:51.800 --> 28:53.664
with this training crap.

28:53.666 --> 28:54.798
Well, you have a skirt,
though, right?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.799
- I think so.
- Okay.

28:56.801 --> 28:59.365
Honey, so I left you $80 here

28:59.367 --> 29:02.333
- and a couple delivery takeout menus.
- Okay.

29:02.335 --> 29:04.867
On the fridge is
the number for my hotel.

29:04.869 --> 29:05.867
- Okay.
- Hey.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.768
No one is coming over
while I'm gone, okay?

29:08.770 --> 29:10.901
- I know. I won't.
- Seriously.

29:10.903 --> 29:12.400
I'm trusting you.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.668
You are gonna be fine.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.869
- Thank you, honey.
- Love you.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.671
I don't know.
I don't think I can.

29:36.673 --> 29:38.672
Dude, your mom is, like,
ten states away.

29:38.674 --> 29:40.906
You're not gonna invite
your new best friends over?

29:40.908 --> 29:42.906
That's fine. That's fine.
I'm not offended.

29:42.908 --> 29:44.673
- It's okay.
- I totally would, seriously,

29:44.675 --> 29:46.406
but we're not even
unpacked yet.

29:46.408 --> 29:47.840
There's, like, nothing to do,
like, at all.

29:47.842 --> 29:50.374
- Yo, what the fuck?
- What is it?

29:50.376 --> 29:51.808
- I am... I'm not touching it.
- Yo.

29:51.810 --> 29:53.541
What if that's a bomb, bro?

29:53.543 --> 29:55.476
- That would suck so hard.
- Fucking suck.

29:56.644 --> 29:58.809
"Love, Ma"?

29:58.811 --> 30:01.710
What?

30:03.578 --> 30:06.610
Hey. I was just thinking,
why wait for the weekend?

30:06.612 --> 30:09.410
It's 5:00 somewhere.

30:11.613 --> 30:13.544
- How did she get our numbers?
- Oh, my God.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.945
Probably Haley. She gives it to
everyone when she's fucked up.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.612
Eh, I can't argue with that.

30:17.614 --> 30:19.411
Yes, yes! Aah!

30:20.648 --> 30:22.513
- Let's rage.
- Whoo!

30:22.515 --> 30:23.813
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay.

30:23.815 --> 30:25.446
To Ma's house we go.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.947
Oh, get in. Get in.

30:33.817 --> 30:36.815
This is... better.

30:36.817 --> 30:38.549
This is way better.

30:38.551 --> 30:40.551
Maggie, Andy, hey!

30:41.851 --> 30:43.817
- Can I get you something?
- Oh, uh...

30:43.819 --> 30:45.550
Got you some wings.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.950
Oh, no, thanks, Sue Ann.
I'm good.

30:46.952 --> 30:50.651
Sue Ann? Oh, uh-uh.
Around here, you call me Ma.

30:50.653 --> 30:52.384
- Ooh.
- Oh.

30:52.386 --> 30:54.453
Okay.

30:57.687 --> 30:59.721
Mmm.

31:00.888 --> 31:04.686
Oh, look at this place.

31:04.688 --> 31:08.387
Girl, look at you,
getting all fancy and shit.

31:08.389 --> 31:09.387
Let's get filthy.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.420
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah?

31:11.422 --> 31:12.921
Hey. Hey.

31:12.923 --> 31:15.555
- Hey!
- Welcome to Ma's.

31:15.557 --> 31:19.756
How you guys doing?
Looking good, handsome. Mmm.

31:19.758 --> 31:21.790
<i>Hey, do you think
we should, like, wake her?</i>

31:21.792 --> 31:24.456
You know, she's been like that
since we got here.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.457
No. That's Ashley,
and she's faking it.

31:27.459 --> 31:29.891
Her dad's a pastor,
so she comes to parties,

31:29.893 --> 31:31.825
pretends to be passed out
so she doesn't have to drink,

31:31.827 --> 31:33.825
and then she won't get
in trouble when she goes home.

31:33.827 --> 31:35.558
That might be the dumbest thing

31:35.560 --> 31:37.424
I've ever heard
in my whole entire life.

31:37.426 --> 31:38.959
Yeah, no, no, no.
It's dumb as shit.

31:38.961 --> 31:41.859
Guys, move that coffee table.
Let's get this party turned up!

31:48.962 --> 31:50.128
Wind me up, Darrell!

33:00.841 --> 33:02.406
- What are y'all up to over here?
- Hey.

33:02.408 --> 33:03.406
- How are y'all doing?
- Whoa.

33:03.408 --> 33:04.540
- Good.
- Good.

33:04.542 --> 33:05.940
- You already started drinking without me?
- You good?

33:05.942 --> 33:07.741
- Yeah. Catch up.
- Come on, now. Come on, now.

33:07.743 --> 33:09.374
Party doesn't start without me.

33:09.376 --> 33:11.674
Watch this.

33:11.676 --> 33:13.374
Hey, Sue Ann.

33:13.376 --> 33:14.575
Hi.

33:14.577 --> 33:15.708
Oh. Thank you.

33:15.710 --> 33:17.142
Why are you sitting down?

33:17.144 --> 33:18.775
Why aren't you up
dancing with everyone?

33:18.777 --> 33:21.943
Um... well, I guess
I was waiting on you.

33:21.945 --> 33:23.776
Oh, okay.
So you're not...

33:23.778 --> 33:25.911
you don't go
to a lot of parties?

33:25.913 --> 33:28.577
Oh. No, no, no,
I-I go to a lot of them.

33:28.579 --> 33:30.477
Oh, no, it's...
no, it's-it's fine.

33:30.479 --> 33:33.613
There's a first time
for everything. Absolutely.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.514
I like your hair.

33:39.714 --> 33:41.846
Thanks.
I like yours.

33:41.848 --> 33:43.749
Really? Thank you.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.715
Here you go.
Come on, Ashley.

33:56.717 --> 33:58.549
One's not gonna kill you.

34:00.651 --> 34:02.652
Ow. Can you help me?

34:04.919 --> 34:07.318
Milk did that body good.

34:08.485 --> 34:10.150
Darrell.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.585
I-I don't even want this.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.585
Those earrings
are beautiful, Maggie.

34:18.587 --> 34:19.920
Oh. Thanks.

34:19.922 --> 34:21.686
My mom gave them to me.

34:21.688 --> 34:23.820
I mean, well,
my dad gave them to my mom

34:23.822 --> 34:25.387
when they first started
going out,

34:25.389 --> 34:26.853
and then she gave them to me.

34:26.856 --> 34:29.455
I mean, they're broken up now,
but, you know.

34:32.857 --> 34:34.955
- You got a sweet mama, huh?
- Yeah.

34:34.956 --> 34:36.888
Yo, turn the music down.
Listen up!

34:36.889 --> 34:38.489
Cheers!

34:38.491 --> 34:40.589
<i>¡En fuego!</i>

34:40.591 --> 34:41.856
Ma, come here.
We're toasting you.

34:41.858 --> 34:43.723
- Do a shot.
- Ooh, I-I don't drink.

34:43.725 --> 34:45.590
I mean, the last time I did,

34:45.592 --> 34:47.556
you really don't want to know.

34:47.559 --> 34:49.658
Boo...!

34:49.659 --> 34:51.456
Ma.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.791
Ma! Ma!

34:52.793 --> 34:55.492
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

34:55.494 --> 34:58.759
Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma! Ma!

34:58.761 --> 35:01.560
Yeah!

35:02.728 --> 35:04.860
- Come on, Ma.
- What was that?

35:04.862 --> 35:07.594
That old-ass ice machine.

35:07.596 --> 35:09.394
Uh, crank up the music, honey.

35:09.396 --> 35:10.828
Who wants shots? Pour me another one.

35:10.830 --> 35:12.494
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah!

35:27.866 --> 35:30.597
I have to pee,
like, really bad.

35:30.599 --> 35:32.932
- Like, right now.
- Okay.

35:32.934 --> 35:34.865
Oh. Hi, Ashley.

35:34.867 --> 35:37.766
- I see you've slept it off.
- Very funny, Haley.

35:37.768 --> 35:40.499
I think Kinsey and Dustin
are fucking in there.

35:42.501 --> 35:44.600
Let's go find another bathroom.

35:44.602 --> 35:45.900
- What?
- Come on.

35:45.902 --> 35:48.167
- No, we can't go up there.
- Shh!

35:48.169 --> 35:49.601
We'll ask nicely.

35:49.603 --> 35:51.601
Shh.

35:54.503 --> 35:56.635
Oh. Fuck.

35:56.637 --> 35:59.370
Yep, that's creepy.

36:11.472 --> 36:13.740
You shouldn't have done that.

36:19.608 --> 36:21.608
I told you.

36:24.175 --> 36:25.674
- Hey, hey, we have to go.
- What? Why?

36:25.676 --> 36:27.407
- No, no. We got to go.
- I'm not done.

36:27.409 --> 36:28.907
- I don't care. Just finish.
- Okay, okay, hang on. Hang on.

36:28.909 --> 36:30.473
- What's going on?
- We have to go.

36:30.475 --> 36:31.741
- No, don't flush!
- Why?

36:31.743 --> 36:34.343
- She'll hear. Just get out.
- Okay. Shh. Shh.

36:36.910 --> 36:39.876
- Whoa! Christ, Ma!
- What the hell?!

36:39.878 --> 36:43.510
What the fuck are y'all doing,
huh?! Get back downstairs!

36:47.012 --> 36:48.877
What's happening?

36:48.879 --> 36:50.878
Can we please just
get out of here?

36:50.880 --> 36:53.477
Oh, my God.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.779
- Maggie, what?
- I don't want to talk about it.

Hey.

So, do you think
that she'd let us throw

38:16.660 --> 38:18.025
a birthday party
at her house this weekend?

38:18.027 --> 38:19.993
I heard she lets you do
basically anything.

38:19.995 --> 38:21.060
I'm sure she'd be down.
You just, like,

38:23.461 --> 38:24.759
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it's kind of cool.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.760
Oh, my God.
I love your bracelet.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.027
Where did you get it?

38:28.029 --> 38:29.794
Taylor gave it to me
for our five-month.

38:29.796 --> 38:32.628
- Aw.
- So I finally let him go down on me.

38:35.197 --> 38:37.497
Wait, how did you wait
five months?

38:40.831 --> 38:43.197
Hey. What's up?

38:44.765 --> 38:47.866
Um, do you want
to go out with me?

38:48.899 --> 38:50.431
Yeah.

38:50.433 --> 38:51.931
- Okay, that's great. Great.
- Yeah.

38:51.933 --> 38:53.631
I don't know why
I was so nervous.

38:53.633 --> 38:55.665
I-I was gonna text you first,
but then I was like,

38:55.667 --> 38:57.765
"Oh, I should ask
old-school," and...

38:57.767 --> 38:59.199
That's cute.

38:59.201 --> 39:02.000
Wait. Like, on a date
or, like, like a couple?

39:04.501 --> 39:05.902
Both.

39:06.902 --> 39:07.901
Okay.

39:07.903 --> 39:11.500
So, why did it take you
so long to ask me out?

39:11.502 --> 39:13.468
I so obviously like you.

39:13.470 --> 39:14.735
Yeah, 'cause I was actually
talking to this other girl.

39:14.737 --> 39:15.735
- Oh, really? This other girl?
- And so I was deciding, like,

39:15.737 --> 39:17.702
- who do I... who do I...
- What's up, lovebirds?

39:17.704 --> 39:19.736
- I love you guys!
- Aah! Oh, my God.

39:19.738 --> 39:21.203
Either she said yes,
or you're holding her

39:21.205 --> 39:22.803
- against her will.
- Shut up, dude.

39:22.805 --> 39:24.970
Ah, I love love, bro.
Don't you love love?

39:24.972 --> 39:26.904
I friggin' adore love.

39:26.906 --> 39:27.971
Hey, guys, guys,
if you get pregnant,

39:27.973 --> 39:29.704
- can you name it Chaz? Please?
- Oh, no.

39:29.706 --> 39:31.872
Oh, my God!
Are we going for pizza or what?

39:31.874 --> 39:33.972
Hell yeah!
I got nine bucks, bitch!

39:33.974 --> 39:35.840
Hey, guys.

39:37.908 --> 39:40.706
Hi. Uh, what-what
are you doing here?

39:40.708 --> 39:44.473
I got us a beer pong table,
and a keg of Bud Light

39:44.475 --> 39:46.773
is on ice if y'all are all down to clown.

39:46.775 --> 39:49.040
I can't tonight. I have to write about

39:49.042 --> 39:51.507
historical shipping routes
of Africa, so...

39:51.509 --> 39:53.507
Yeah, all those ships
with our people in the belly.

39:53.509 --> 39:54.910
Ain't that right, Sue Ann?

39:58.577 --> 40:00.542
What about the rest
of you guys?

40:00.544 --> 40:03.043
Um... Sorry, Ma, I can't.

40:03.045 --> 40:05.210
School night's hard for me.

40:05.212 --> 40:07.711
Well, who needs y'all?

40:07.713 --> 40:11.744
Girls, girls, you guys want to
party like rock stars, or what?

40:11.746 --> 40:13.912
No, I got to clean the
house before my mom gets home.

40:13.914 --> 40:15.545
Hey, maybe next time.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.947
Damn, Ma.
Don't you got a job?

40:18.714 --> 40:20.880
Yeah, I guess
I should work a double

40:20.882 --> 40:22.779
since you guys
don't have time for me.

40:22.781 --> 40:25.647
Girl, you need a man.

40:25.649 --> 40:28.549
Girl, you need
to watch your mouth.

40:38.584 --> 40:40.883
Okay, bye.

40:40.885 --> 40:42.618
So weird.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.751
- Here you go.
- All right. Thanks, Ma.

40:49.753 --> 40:51.386
You need to follow me.

41:13.991 --> 41:16.488
Hey, Ma!

41:16.490 --> 41:18.924
Loser!

41:33.660 --> 41:35.758
<i>The hotel is amazing,</i>

41:35.760 --> 41:37.993
and my instructor said
that my card technique

41:37.995 --> 41:39.226
was the best of the bunch.

41:39.228 --> 41:42.659
And then Stu thinks we'll be
actually dealing at the table

41:42.661 --> 41:44.526
in about two months.

41:44.528 --> 41:46.629
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

41:48.629 --> 41:50.628
I'm sorry
I've been gone so much.

41:50.630 --> 41:51.794
No, it's okay.

41:51.796 --> 41:53.661
I know you're working hard

41:53.663 --> 41:55.595
and someone's got to
pay the bills, right?

41:55.597 --> 41:56.762
That's sweet.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.062
How was school?

42:01.598 --> 42:02.930
School was good.

42:02.932 --> 42:05.463
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:05.465 --> 42:07.697
What are you not saying?

42:07.699 --> 42:08.998
Andy asked me out.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.564
He asked you out?

42:12.566 --> 42:14.765
Who's Andy?
And what did you say?

42:14.767 --> 42:16.965
Oh, my God, he's so cute, Mom.
I said yes.

42:16.967 --> 42:19.733
Well, I got to meet this Andy.

42:19.735 --> 42:21.499
Maybe next week.

42:21.501 --> 42:23.532
We're going out tomorrow night,
if that's cool.

42:23.534 --> 42:24.967
Yeah. Okay.

42:24.969 --> 42:26.934
I think it's super cool.

42:28.569 --> 42:30.533
You have a boyfriend.

42:30.535 --> 42:32.534
I mean, I-I guess.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.007
Pow.

43:00.707 --> 43:02.541
Whoa!

43:16.477 --> 43:17.808
We won't stay long, I promise.

43:17.810 --> 43:19.076
Tell Stephanie
"happy birthday,"

43:19.078 --> 43:20.676
and then we're
getting out of here.

43:22.611 --> 43:24.243
It's my birthday!

43:25.579 --> 43:27.610
Who are all these people?

43:27.612 --> 43:28.877
Probably from other schools.

43:28.879 --> 43:31.544
Hey!

43:31.546 --> 43:32.678
- Finally made it.
- Hey.

43:32.680 --> 43:33.811
Everyone is here.

43:33.813 --> 43:36.778
Yeah. Well, it really is a great party.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.879
- Hey, let me get you a drink. Okay?
- Ah, yeah.

43:38.881 --> 43:40.646
Something sweet.

43:43.082 --> 43:45.813
- He's a cutie.
- Yeah, he is.

43:45.815 --> 43:49.581
You be careful now.
Take it real slow.

43:49.583 --> 43:50.714
Men are dogs.

43:50.716 --> 43:52.547
They only want one thing,

43:52.549 --> 43:54.681
and you don't want to mess
your life up with a baby.

43:54.683 --> 43:56.782
Jesus, you sound
like my mother.

44:03.019 --> 44:05.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:19.788 --> 44:21.653
- Oh, yeah. That was, that was great.
- Yeah.

44:21.655 --> 44:22.686
Oh, I was gonna ask you.

44:22.688 --> 44:25.054
Oh, God.
No, that was perfect.

44:25.056 --> 44:26.754
Did you know my van's
actually parked...

44:26.756 --> 44:28.754
Let's do some shots, everybody.

44:28.756 --> 44:31.988
Come on, birthday girl.
Get your shot.

44:34.924 --> 44:37.656
Maggie, do mine for me.

44:37.658 --> 44:38.989
- You know I can't keep up.
- Uh, I don't know.

44:38.991 --> 44:40.789
If I do more than one,
I'll be sick.

44:40.791 --> 44:42.555
Don't be a loser, just do it.

44:42.557 --> 44:43.790
Come on, it's my birthday.
For me.

44:43.792 --> 44:44.823
Okay.

44:44.825 --> 44:46.924
Okay, to Stephanie.

44:46.926 --> 44:48.991
Yeah!

44:48.993 --> 44:50.991
- Hey, what's up, dude?
- Oh, this is a good one.

44:50.993 --> 44:52.058
Yeah!

44:57.994 --> 44:59.560
Hey!

45:51.569 --> 45:53.501
Oh, what the hell?

45:59.604 --> 46:00.970
Oh.

46:00.972 --> 46:02.805
What the...?

46:05.939 --> 46:07.572
Oh.

46:08.906 --> 46:11.537
I remember...

46:11.539 --> 46:14.872
going to the party,
and then I woke up.

46:14.874 --> 46:17.505
Don't remember
getting h... home.

46:17.507 --> 46:18.806
Oh, God, what did I do?

46:18.808 --> 46:21.739
You got really sloppy,
like, really quick.

46:21.741 --> 46:23.706
You were falling
all over the place.

46:23.708 --> 46:25.041
Flashed Chaz your tits.

46:25.043 --> 46:26.840
No. No!

46:26.842 --> 46:28.507
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:28.509 --> 46:29.974
No, it's okay.
I got you out of there

46:29.976 --> 46:32.574
before anyone really noticed,
so it's not a big deal.

46:32.576 --> 46:33.977
Oh, my God, no.

46:35.543 --> 46:36.909
Oh, my God.
I'm fucking with you.

46:36.911 --> 46:37.842
Seriously, you're fine. You...

46:37.844 --> 46:40.678
Oh, you're such an asshole.

46:45.812 --> 46:46.977
What's wrong?

46:46.979 --> 46:49.078
I don't want to hang out
at Ma's anymore.

46:49.080 --> 46:51.111
And I don't want
you there, either.

46:51.113 --> 46:54.546
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

46:55.580 --> 46:56.781
Why?

46:58.781 --> 47:00.714
Okay, I won't.

47:02.882 --> 47:05.813
But now you have to go
get egg rolls with me.

47:05.815 --> 47:08.580
- Okay.
- I'm gonna put ketchup on them.

47:08.582 --> 47:09.983
Okay.

47:37.654 --> 47:38.986
Oh, shit.

47:38.988 --> 47:40.986
- What?
- She's home. She's home.

47:40.988 --> 47:43.753
All right.
Um, uh, get in the chair.

47:43.755 --> 47:45.755
Just... sit down.
I don't know.

47:53.890 --> 47:55.522
Hey!

47:55.524 --> 47:57.024
Hey, Mags.

48:00.959 --> 48:02.990
There's a boy in my house.

48:02.992 --> 48:04.656
Do you know him?

48:04.658 --> 48:06.123
Shit.

48:06.125 --> 48:08.926
Hi, Mrs. Thompson.
I'm... Andy. Nice to meet you.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.958
Nice to finally meet you, Andy.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.894
How was work?

48:15.927 --> 48:17.825
It was busy.

48:17.827 --> 48:19.628
Mm-hmm.

48:22.095 --> 48:24.461
You two thirsty?

48:28.029 --> 48:30.695
You cooking?

48:30.697 --> 48:32.861
Cheesesteaks.

48:32.863 --> 48:36.295
- Do you want one?
- No, I'm good.

48:36.297 --> 48:39.063
Have a seat, Andy.

48:39.065 --> 48:41.063
My mom passed away
five years ago.

48:41.065 --> 48:42.997
And my dad owns
an armored vehicle company,

48:42.999 --> 48:45.596
so they transport stuff
for, like,

48:45.598 --> 48:47.297
museums and banks
and that kind of thing.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.131
Is your dad Ben Hawkins?

48:49.133 --> 48:51.931
- Yeah.
- We went to high school together.

48:53.833 --> 48:56.799
I didn't know about your mom.
I'm so sorry.

48:56.801 --> 48:57.999
That's okay.

48:58.001 --> 49:00.598
Dad's got a new fuck buddy now.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.833
Uh, sorry.

49:01.835 --> 49:03.566
- Mercedes?
- Yeah.

49:03.568 --> 49:04.866
Yeah.

49:04.868 --> 49:06.769
How do we like her?

49:08.003 --> 49:09.834
Let's just say
I'm more of a...

49:09.836 --> 49:11.101
Porsche kind of guy.

49:11.103 --> 49:12.802
Mm.

49:12.804 --> 49:14.902
- Yeah, she's a bitch.
- All right.

49:14.904 --> 49:17.935
- Sorry.
- Do you want some more to drink, guys?

49:17.937 --> 49:20.003
I'm okay, thanks.

49:24.872 --> 49:26.870
You're really
blowing up there, kid.

49:26.872 --> 49:28.737
Mom.

49:28.739 --> 49:31.074
- You got a lot of girlfriends, Andy?
- Stop.

49:40.008 --> 49:41.839
- Oh, just block her.
- Jesus Christ.

49:41.841 --> 49:42.940
I did.

49:42.942 --> 49:44.940
Yeah, Andy had to as well.

49:44.942 --> 49:46.840
I feel bad.

49:46.842 --> 49:48.941
Don't. Who cares?

49:48.943 --> 49:51.641
You know what? I'm gonna
tell everyone else, too.

49:56.011 --> 49:58.942
All right, listen up, bitches.

49:58.944 --> 50:00.810
Everybody block Ma for good.

50:00.812 --> 50:03.876
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

50:03.878 --> 50:05.710
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

50:05.712 --> 50:07.544
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

50:07.546 --> 50:09.013
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

50:10.013 --> 50:12.611
Do you mind?

50:12.613 --> 50:14.979
How about you mind
your own damn business!

50:14.981 --> 50:16.912
You're making
your business my business.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.813
Not today, old lady!
Not today!

50:18.815 --> 50:20.581
You bitch.

50:21.781 --> 50:23.548
Here, Donna.

50:24.882 --> 50:26.615
Shit.

50:28.882 --> 50:30.616
Move!

50:32.117 --> 50:33.881
Listen up, bitches.

50:33.883 --> 50:36.882
Everybody block Ma for good.

50:36.884 --> 50:39.882
I'm serious.
That bitch is crazy.

50:39.884 --> 50:42.583
Look, my grandmother
is very sweet.

50:42.585 --> 50:44.150
We'll see if we can,
like, hang out

50:44.152 --> 50:47.017
in her lame-ass house
instead. Okay?

50:47.019 --> 50:49.684
Sue Ann!

50:49.686 --> 50:52.018
Have you fed the animals?

51:10.923 --> 51:12.991
Hello?

51:14.623 --> 51:17.523
Over here. Close the door.

51:40.995 --> 51:42.793
Hey, this is Ma.

51:42.795 --> 51:45.094
I got a new number!

51:45.096 --> 51:47.560
Just picking up a few things.

51:47.562 --> 51:49.861
Don't make me drink alone.
And I don't want to hear

51:49.863 --> 51:51.861
any of this
"I have homework" crap.

51:51.863 --> 51:53.128
Don't make me drink alone.

51:53.130 --> 51:54.962
♪ Don't make me
drink alone ♪

51:54.964 --> 51:58.162
♪ Don't make me drink alone.

51:58.164 --> 52:00.730
Are you guys mad at me
for something?

52:00.732 --> 52:05.596
I mean, I, uh, risked my job
so that you could have fun,

52:05.598 --> 52:07.964
and we definitely did.

52:07.966 --> 52:11.597
The least you could do is,
you know, say thank you.

52:11.599 --> 52:14.567
Hey, guys. It's Sue Ann.

52:15.767 --> 52:18.833
Look, I really need you
to meet me...

52:18.835 --> 52:21.966
at the rock piles
after school tomorrow.

52:21.968 --> 52:24.033
It's an emergency.

52:24.035 --> 52:25.936
Please come.

52:40.604 --> 52:42.905
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

52:45.638 --> 52:47.170
Hey.

52:47.172 --> 52:48.904
Oh.

52:48.906 --> 52:51.904
You guys are so sweet
to meet me out here.

52:51.906 --> 52:53.971
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's...

52:53.973 --> 52:55.805
Sorry-sorry for the dramatics.

52:55.807 --> 52:57.774
It's just that, uh...

53:00.942 --> 53:03.773
I'm sick.

53:03.775 --> 53:05.806
What's wrong?

53:05.808 --> 53:08.074
It's cancer.

53:08.076 --> 53:09.874
Pancreatic.

53:09.876 --> 53:12.775
And I've been taking
a lot of medicine lately.

53:12.777 --> 53:16.009
The doctors don't really know
how to treat it yet.

53:16.011 --> 53:19.076
And it's scary,
because the meds make me...

53:19.078 --> 53:23.676
less fun and-and not myself,
so I'm sorry.

53:23.678 --> 53:25.877
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

53:25.879 --> 53:27.610
- Sorry.
- We had no idea.

53:27.612 --> 53:28.944
I know, honey, I know.

53:28.946 --> 53:31.012
I just... I try
to live my life privately.

53:31.014 --> 53:32.578
But I'm gonna beat this.

53:32.580 --> 53:34.078
- Yeah.
- I could sure use

53:34.080 --> 53:36.779
some friends, though.

53:36.781 --> 53:38.746
I'm gonna beat this, right?

53:40.115 --> 53:41.981
Okay.

53:43.016 --> 53:44.648
Oh, sweetie.

53:45.982 --> 53:47.980
I got to go back to work.

53:47.982 --> 53:51.748
I just wanted to...
let you guys know.

53:51.750 --> 53:53.115
You can beat it, Ma.

53:53.117 --> 53:56.648
My granddad did,
and he's a fucking pussy, so...

53:56.650 --> 53:58.749
Yeah, Ma.

53:58.751 --> 54:00.349
- Stay strong.
- Thanks.

54:00.351 --> 54:03.183
And, uh, if you have time

54:03.185 --> 54:06.650
or you want to come over
on Saturday...

54:06.652 --> 54:08.650
No pressure, though.

54:08.652 --> 54:10.552
No pressure.

54:13.887 --> 54:16.618
Well, fuck me in the butt.

54:27.689 --> 54:29.754
Come with me.

54:29.756 --> 54:31.855
Come on. Goddamn, Rosco,
bring your ass...

54:31.857 --> 54:33.721
Oh, shit!

54:33.723 --> 54:35.955
Come on.

54:35.957 --> 54:37.589
She was wearing
Stephanie's bracelet.

54:37.591 --> 54:38.822
You didn't notice?

54:38.824 --> 54:40.156
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:40.158 --> 54:42.957
Get your ass
in this motherfucking trailer.

54:42.959 --> 54:44.957
I've been missing
my grandma's ring,

54:44.959 --> 54:47.923
and my mom is gonna fucking
kill me if I don't find it.

54:47.925 --> 54:49.158
And I bet she has it.

54:49.160 --> 54:52.993
You know, I'm missing
the earrings my mom gave me.

54:54.794 --> 54:56.658
We're going
to that bitch's house.

54:57.660 --> 54:59.925
Hey. Hey!
What if somebody sees us?

54:59.927 --> 55:03.062
We're in bum-fuck, dumbass.
Nobody's gonna see us.

55:04.895 --> 55:06.594
- Oh, shit.
- Haley? Haley?

55:06.596 --> 55:07.927
Let's go, okay?
I'm serious.

55:07.929 --> 55:09.896
No. I know she has
my grandma's ring.

55:11.063 --> 55:12.895
Don't be such a pussy.
Let's go.

55:15.131 --> 55:18.664
Wow, this is...
really graceful.

55:27.999 --> 55:29.930
Maggie.

55:29.932 --> 55:31.700
Ugh.

55:39.934 --> 55:42.733
What the hell?

55:42.735 --> 55:44.935
What?

56:06.806 --> 56:09.071
Yeah.

56:10.973 --> 56:13.938
Whoa.

56:13.940 --> 56:16.805
Cool it with the pics, Ma.

56:32.910 --> 56:34.977
This is so creepy.

56:40.778 --> 56:41.776
Sue Ann?

56:41.778 --> 56:43.910
Ben.

56:43.912 --> 56:45.943
I didn't know you worked here.

56:45.945 --> 56:48.077
How are you? How you been?

56:48.079 --> 56:49.878
I'm-I'm good.

56:49.880 --> 56:51.677
Yeah, I'm-I'm good.

56:51.679 --> 56:53.844
Well, uh,
this old guy needs his shots.

56:53.846 --> 56:56.179
Our vet moved to Florida
in December,

56:56.181 --> 56:58.678
so we're looking
for a new spot.

56:58.680 --> 57:00.079
Well...

57:00.081 --> 57:02.715
we can certainly do that.

57:05.681 --> 57:06.881
Well, it's good to see you.
You look great.

57:06.883 --> 57:09.081
How long has it been, huh?

57:09.083 --> 57:10.114
15 years?

57:10.116 --> 57:11.947
- 20?
- Something like that.

57:11.949 --> 57:13.948
That makes me feel old.

57:13.950 --> 57:15.215
I don't like it.

57:15.217 --> 57:17.082
Me, neither.
I feel it every day.

57:17.084 --> 57:19.682
Oh, just-just sign it.
I'll do the rest.

57:19.684 --> 57:20.916
Sure.

57:24.652 --> 57:26.683
Well, it's good to see you.

57:26.685 --> 57:28.750
We should catch up sometime.

57:28.752 --> 57:30.084
Really?

57:30.086 --> 57:32.785
I-I...

57:32.787 --> 57:34.185
I'd like that.

57:37.821 --> 57:40.752
- You know Magill's Pub?
- Yeah.

57:40.754 --> 57:41.986
I'll come back after work,
pick him up,

57:41.988 --> 57:42.853
and we can go right there.

57:42.855 --> 57:45.686
I-I wouldn't want to go
in my scrubs.

57:45.688 --> 57:48.020
How about I meet you there
at 6:00?

57:48.022 --> 57:49.821
All right.

57:49.823 --> 57:50.988
Hello?

58:18.228 --> 58:19.959
Uh, Maggie?

58:19.961 --> 58:21.193
What?

58:21.195 --> 58:23.793
You might want to,
um, take a...

58:23.795 --> 58:25.627
Oh, my God!

58:30.063 --> 58:32.064
What are you guys
doing in here?

58:35.230 --> 58:38.029
It's okay. I don't mind.

58:38.031 --> 58:40.729
Uh, what are you doing here?

58:40.731 --> 58:42.630
I live here.
This is my house.

58:42.632 --> 58:44.830
Uh, you can walk?

58:44.832 --> 58:47.097
- I mean, I thought that...
- I'm not supposed to.

58:47.099 --> 58:49.731
- I'm sick.
- Uh, sorry.

58:49.733 --> 58:51.067
What's happening?

58:52.067 --> 58:53.831
Uh, do you know Haley?

58:53.833 --> 58:55.099
Haley, this is...

58:55.101 --> 58:56.999
Genie. Genie, right?

58:57.001 --> 58:59.399
Yeah, we were here,
uh, last week,

58:59.401 --> 59:01.033
and I left my school I.D.

59:01.035 --> 59:03.033
I need it for the PSATs.

59:03.035 --> 59:04.900
Hi, Genie.

59:04.902 --> 59:07.001
Hi.

59:07.003 --> 59:09.003
You have pretty teeth.

59:10.769 --> 59:12.835
Uh, that's-that's
very sweet of you.

59:12.837 --> 59:14.768
I haven't seen you

59:14.770 --> 59:15.968
at school in, like, forever.

59:15.970 --> 59:18.203
Yeah, my mom, sh...

59:18.205 --> 59:20.936
I get sick a lot, and my mom
thought it would be better

59:20.938 --> 59:22.170
if I stay home for a while.

59:22.172 --> 59:24.171
- Oh.
- My mom says that the doctors say

59:24.173 --> 59:26.139
it's my spine
and it's getting worse.

59:27.672 --> 59:30.004
My mind is, like...
blown.

59:30.006 --> 59:32.105
Um...

59:32.107 --> 59:34.771
Ma is your m-mom?

59:34.773 --> 59:38.741
- I'm sorry, uh, Sue Ann is your-your mom?
- Yeah.

59:47.909 --> 59:51.108
I hear you guys downstairs
in the basement a lot.

59:51.110 --> 59:53.408
Is it fun?

59:53.410 --> 59:56.875
Uh... it can be.

59:56.877 --> 59:58.877
You should come.

01:00:04.678 --> 01:00:06.977
Y-You guys should leave.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:10.111
My mom doesn't like
when anybody's in her room.

01:00:10.113 --> 01:00:12.678
It's better
not to get her upset.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.079
I won't tell her
you were here if you don't.

01:00:14.081 --> 01:00:16.845
Oh, no, we're not saying shit.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.979
Maybe I'll see you at school?

01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:20.679
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

01:00:20.681 --> 01:00:21.781
- Go ahead.
- Maybe.

01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:24.582
Bye.

01:00:38.651 --> 01:00:39.916
- Shit.
- Go, go!

01:00:39.918 --> 01:00:40.916
Get out of here!

01:00:40.918 --> 01:00:42.917
Okay.

01:00:48.753 --> 01:00:50.051
Genie!

01:00:50.053 --> 01:00:51.918
Yes, Mama?

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.918
You been down here
messing with these kitties?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.119
No, ma'am.

01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:58.121
Well, they've been moved!

01:01:21.991 --> 01:01:24.193
Go.

01:01:25.992 --> 01:01:27.757
You look pretty.

01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:29.124
I'm going out.

01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:30.724
It's time for your medicine.

01:01:30.726 --> 01:01:33.092
I was wondering
if I can go back to school.

01:01:33.094 --> 01:01:36.725
I'm feeling better,
and I miss my classes.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:37.759
You're too sick.

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:40.992
And these doctors,
they don't quite see it yet.

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:42.194
I know.

01:01:42.196 --> 01:01:43.860
But maybe half a day
would work.

01:01:43.862 --> 01:01:45.127
That way,
my teachers can grade

01:01:45.129 --> 01:01:47.860
my homework
and you don't have to.

01:01:47.862 --> 01:01:49.994
I can ride the bus.

01:01:49.996 --> 01:01:52.763
You don't look well, baby.

01:01:54.997 --> 01:01:58.096
And your hair is way too long.

01:01:58.098 --> 01:02:00.097
So maybe we should just

01:02:00.099 --> 01:02:03.896
cut it all off
before it all falls out.

01:02:03.898 --> 01:02:06.664
The other kids
will make fun of you.

01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:08.897
That's what they do.

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:11.098
That's why you have
to stay here with me,

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.101
where it's safe.

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.733
Mommy loves you.

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.002
<i>It's your first time, isn't it?</i>

01:02:40.004 --> 01:02:41.702
<i>Do you even know
what you're doing?</i>

01:02:41.704 --> 01:02:43.237
No.

01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:46.736
You're gonna get on your knees.

01:02:46.738 --> 01:02:48.673
Put it in your mouth.

01:02:50.673 --> 01:02:55.672
Move your head
backwards, forwards.

01:02:55.674 --> 01:02:58.839
Believe me,
it won't take long.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.873
You look hot.

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:03.142
- Thanks, Mercedes.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:04.675 --> 01:03:06.809
Pow, girl.

01:03:12.777 --> 01:03:14.975
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:03:14.977 --> 01:03:17.842
Oh.
Don't even worry about it.

01:03:17.844 --> 01:03:21.210
I got caught up at the office.

01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:23.944
Well, you look lovely.

01:03:23.946 --> 01:03:26.111
Oh, hey. How are you?

01:03:26.113 --> 01:03:27.810
I'll have a Maker's, neat.

01:03:27.812 --> 01:03:28.977
And Sue Ann?

01:03:28.979 --> 01:03:31.744
Uh, uh, Diet Coke, please.

01:03:31.746 --> 01:03:33.212
Are you really gonna
make me drink alone?

01:03:33.214 --> 01:03:37.113
Oh, I am content to sit here
and watch you do your thing.

01:03:37.115 --> 01:03:40.846
Hmm. Fair enough.

01:03:40.848 --> 01:03:44.680
So, uh, you keep in touch
with anyone from school?

01:03:44.682 --> 01:03:46.114
No, no.

01:03:46.116 --> 01:03:49.014
I mean, I run into people
every now and then, but, uh,

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:52.215
I don't do reunions
or anything like that.

01:03:52.217 --> 01:03:54.216
I went to the ten-year reunion.

01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:56.915
After that, forget it.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:59.449
My wife hated
the entire experience.

01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:01.450
I heard she passed away.

01:04:01.452 --> 01:04:03.016
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:03.018 --> 01:04:06.017
Yeah. Cancer got her.

01:04:06.019 --> 01:04:07.451
What are you gonna do.

01:04:07.453 --> 01:04:11.151
Yeah. I was, uh,
married years ago.

01:04:11.153 --> 01:04:13.885
But... it didn't work out.

01:04:13.887 --> 01:04:16.918
Sometimes you want something
so badly,

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.886
and then suddenly you just...

01:04:19.888 --> 01:04:21.888
don't.

01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:33.855
Do you know what this is?

01:04:33.857 --> 01:04:35.754
What is that, a Taser?

01:04:35.756 --> 01:04:39.189
You gonna tase me for drinking
a Diet Coke, Ben?

01:04:39.191 --> 01:04:41.755
It's a personal
tracking device.

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:42.890
Okay.

01:04:42.892 --> 01:04:44.124
I have these devices

01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:46.756
on my entire fleet
of trucks and vans,

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.458
including my son Andrew's van.

01:04:51.793 --> 01:04:55.660
Why the fuck is my son
spending time at your house?

01:04:56.694 --> 01:04:58.692
You need to talk to him.

01:04:58.694 --> 01:05:01.761
Well, I'm talking to you,
right now.

01:05:03.262 --> 01:05:06.094
I don't know what you want me
to say, Ben.

01:05:06.096 --> 01:05:09.994
C-Could we please
not do this here?

01:05:09.996 --> 01:05:13.862
Well, here's what I think.

01:05:13.864 --> 01:05:16.195
I think you're trying
to get back at me.

01:05:16.197 --> 01:05:18.029
Come on.

01:05:18.031 --> 01:05:20.263
We both know
you had a thing for me,

01:05:20.265 --> 01:05:24.030
and I barely gave you
the time of day.

01:05:24.032 --> 01:05:26.030
You're a loser, Sue Ann.

01:05:26.032 --> 01:05:28.133
You always have been,
and it's pathetic.

01:05:29.933 --> 01:05:33.931
Some people
just don't change, do they?

01:05:33.933 --> 01:05:37.166
No. They don't.

01:05:37.168 --> 01:05:40.732
This is your one warning,
Sue Ann.

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:44.467
And if I hear that my son
has ended up anywhere near you

01:05:44.469 --> 01:05:48.268
or your damn house,
I won't be calling the police.

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:50.801
I'll handle it myself.

01:05:50.803 --> 01:05:53.769
You understand me?

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.472
Sue Ann,
put down the damn phone.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:15.940
Get the clippers
and shave this fella.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:35.175
Genie is Ma's daughter,
and she never told us.

01:06:35.177 --> 01:06:36.876
Okay? She can walk.

01:06:36.878 --> 01:06:38.276
And she's been in that house

01:06:38.278 --> 01:06:39.976
the whole time
we've been there.

01:06:39.978 --> 01:06:41.977
Ma went to high school
with our parents.

01:06:41.979 --> 01:06:44.244
Like, she tore out pages
from her yearbook

01:06:44.246 --> 01:06:47.110
and pasted herself
in pictures with your dad

01:06:47.112 --> 01:06:49.278
and my mom and Mercedes.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.811
- I mean, it's so creepy!
- Who cares?

01:06:50.813 --> 01:06:52.311
Pancreatic cancer's
some fucked-up shit.

01:06:52.313 --> 01:06:55.312
All that medicine
makes you do some weird stuff.

01:06:55.314 --> 01:06:57.812
You can't be serious.

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:00.880
My mom acted weird, too,
before she died.

01:07:00.882 --> 01:07:02.915
Oh.

01:07:05.816 --> 01:07:07.849
I'm sorry about your mom.

01:07:09.716 --> 01:07:13.715
But I don't... I don't think
Sue Ann has cancer.

01:07:13.717 --> 01:07:16.048
I think she used to be
in love with your dad,

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:19.216
and I think she's, like,
in love with you now.

01:07:19.218 --> 01:07:21.216
Well, duh.

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:23.250
Oh, my God.

01:07:23.252 --> 01:07:25.251
- I'm kidding.
- You're totally into it.

01:07:25.253 --> 01:07:27.251
I'm sort of kidding, yeah.

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:29.251
Leaving,
that was the easy part.

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:31.951
I didn't worry about that.
The move was hard.

01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:35.185
Oh, I hear you
loud and clear with that one.

01:07:35.187 --> 01:07:37.952
Right? And I just never realized

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:42.020
how much stuff I had
until I saw it all in boxes.

01:07:42.022 --> 01:07:44.853
- Oh. Mm, mm, mm.
- So...

01:07:44.855 --> 01:07:46.187
It was diffi...

01:07:46.189 --> 01:07:47.754
Hi, honey!

01:07:47.756 --> 01:07:49.054
I want you to meet someone.

01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:50.821
This is Sue Ann.

01:07:50.823 --> 01:07:52.787
Mags?

01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:54.722
Maggie.

01:07:54.724 --> 01:07:56.322
Nice to meet you, Maggie.

01:07:56.324 --> 01:07:58.122
Nice to meet you, too.

01:07:58.124 --> 01:08:01.323
She works at the vet
where we take Lou.

01:08:01.325 --> 01:08:03.056
And then
she was just stopping in

01:08:03.058 --> 01:08:05.056
to check on how he was doing.

01:08:05.058 --> 01:08:06.957
Oh, just a friendly follow-up
to make sure

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:08.891
there wasn't a reaction
to the shots.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:12.125
Here. Come. Sit down.

01:08:12.127 --> 01:08:13.925
And guess what.

01:08:13.927 --> 01:08:17.024
We went to high school
together,

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:20.059
- with Ben and Mercedes.
- Huh.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.260
Mm. So, uh, where do you go
to school, Maggie?

01:08:23.261 --> 01:08:25.194
I go to Franklin.

01:08:25.196 --> 01:08:28.727
I know how hard it can be
to make friends.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.895
Well, she's doing good.
She's made some great friends.

01:08:30.897 --> 01:08:33.928
Really nice kids.
I'm proud of her.

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.062
- Oh, shoot. Look at me.
- Oh.

01:08:36.064 --> 01:08:38.062
Always running behind.

01:08:38.064 --> 01:08:40.962
Sorry to just drop by
unannounced.

01:08:40.964 --> 01:08:43.830
I just get so attached
to these animals so quickly.

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:45.163
- Oh.
- There's probably something wrong with me.

01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:46.163
Oh, please.

01:08:46.166 --> 01:08:48.064
Thank you so much.

01:08:48.066 --> 01:08:50.497
Come by anytime.
You're welcome.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.064
It was so good to see you.

01:08:54.067 --> 01:08:56.067
You, too.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.899
And, Maggie,

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.935
you look after that dog
for me, now.

01:09:11.203 --> 01:09:13.068
<i>Don't stop.</i>

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:15.301
<i>Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't.</i>

01:09:21.272 --> 01:09:23.336
Was I... good?

01:09:23.337 --> 01:09:26.270
Yeah.

01:09:26.273 --> 01:09:30.005
Um, Ben, are you gonna talk
to me tomorrow?

01:09:30.006 --> 01:09:33.071
Let's get out of here.

01:09:33.073 --> 01:09:35.073
Okay.

01:09:44.075 --> 01:09:45.907
Ben?

01:09:45.908 --> 01:09:48.143
Surprise.

01:09:51.176 --> 01:09:53.975
Oh, God.
That took forever.

01:09:53.977 --> 01:09:55.209
So, how was she?

01:09:55.211 --> 01:09:57.775
- Was she good?
- It was fucking awesome.

01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:24.080
Fucking cunt.

01:10:47.319 --> 01:10:49.686
Louie?

01:10:52.253 --> 01:10:53.818
Louie?!

01:10:55.087 --> 01:10:56.221
Louie!

01:11:30.896 --> 01:11:33.161
Oh, my God. You're bleeding!

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.099
Hello?

01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:15.135
His breathing's slow.

01:12:15.137 --> 01:12:16.968
I don't think
we should move him.

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:18.403
I'm gonna call Sue Ann,
and she...

01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:20.103
Don't.

01:12:20.105 --> 01:12:22.136
Don't call her.

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:23.972
Why?

01:12:25.273 --> 01:12:27.273
What's the matter?

01:12:29.172 --> 01:12:31.073
I know her.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.040
I've been to her house.

01:12:41.609 --> 01:12:43.607
Well, look who it is.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.107
Enough!

01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:46.173
I don't have time
for this shit.

01:12:46.175 --> 01:12:47.274
Where's my son?

01:12:47.276 --> 01:12:49.275
Nobody's here
but you and me, Ben.

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:51.974
I know he's here.
Andrew, come out here!

01:12:51.976 --> 01:12:55.075
Do you know what this is?

01:12:55.077 --> 01:12:56.376
What?

01:12:58.244 --> 01:12:59.943
Jesus Christ! You...

01:13:11.013 --> 01:13:14.312
I am so disappointed in you.
What were you thinking?

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:15.911
Everyone kept going over there,

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:17.345
and I thought,
if I didn't want to,

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:19.413
they wouldn't want
to be friends with me anymore.

01:13:19.415 --> 01:13:22.079
You are 16 years old.
Do you realize...

01:13:22.081 --> 01:13:24.447
Sneaking booze
at prom is one thing.

01:13:24.449 --> 01:13:27.047
But hanging around
in this fucking bitch's house

01:13:27.049 --> 01:13:29.180
while she's feeding
everyone alcohol,

01:13:29.182 --> 01:13:31.448
that is unacceptable!

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.315
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Andy's father,

01:13:33.317 --> 01:13:35.015
- and he...
- No! Stop!

01:13:35.017 --> 01:13:37.116
Please don't call him.
He had nothing to do with this.

01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:38.982
He's the most innocent one
of all of us.

01:13:38.984 --> 01:13:40.149
Please don't call him.

01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:43.183
Go in your room.
Go to your room.

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:46.183
Your ass is staying in
this house till summer break!

01:13:46.185 --> 01:13:48.084
Period!
And you are never

01:13:48.086 --> 01:13:49.318
stepping foot
in that woman's house!

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.051
You're not going in Andy's van!

01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:52.917
You're not going
wherever the fuck you think

01:13:52.919 --> 01:13:54.388
you want to be going!

01:14:00.222 --> 01:14:02.853
Surprise.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:05.053
Oh, don't worry.

01:14:05.055 --> 01:14:06.987
I'll let Andy know
you'll be out late.

01:14:09.922 --> 01:14:13.389
Ben, Ben, Ben.

01:14:18.258 --> 01:14:21.123
You know...

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:24.057
...I didn't know
what to do with you at first.

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.857
Sue Ann, please.

01:14:27.892 --> 01:14:31.058
What do we have here?

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:33.292
Is this what you were gonna
show me in that closet?

01:14:35.193 --> 01:14:37.259
Maybe I should cut it off.

01:14:41.862 --> 01:14:42.926
Maybe not.

01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:49.929
What you did to me...

01:14:52.163 --> 01:14:54.164
...the humiliation...

01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.962
...it never goes away.

01:14:57.964 --> 01:15:00.196
Please, Sue Ann.

01:15:00.198 --> 01:15:03.096
But then it hit me.

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:04.996
"Sue Ann,

01:15:04.998 --> 01:15:07.097
you're thinking about this
the wrong way."

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.997
You see,
you treated me like a dog,

01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:13.067
because that's what you are.

01:15:16.367 --> 01:15:18.932
You...

01:15:18.934 --> 01:15:21.433
you're no man, Ben Hawkins.

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:23.199
What the fuck is that?

01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:31.068
Please, Sue Ann.

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.335
I was just a kid.

01:15:32.337 --> 01:15:34.335
So was I, motherfucker.

01:15:34.337 --> 01:15:35.335
No. No!

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:38.369
No, no, no.

01:15:54.207 --> 01:15:56.306
Tomorrow's my day off.

01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:59.341
You're getting up and
coming with me to run errands.

01:16:01.342 --> 01:16:04.108
And your butt's in my car
at 8:00 a.m.

01:16:06.009 --> 01:16:08.007
Bitch.

01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:13.941
Hey, Erica.

01:16:13.943 --> 01:16:16.875
You ever come near my house
or my daughter again,

01:16:16.877 --> 01:16:18.976
I'm calling the police.

01:16:18.978 --> 01:16:21.376
What on earth
are you talking about?

01:16:21.378 --> 01:16:24.411
What kind of mother
parties with high schoolers?

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.943
I think you've had
a little too much coffee.

01:16:26.945 --> 01:16:28.077
Excuse me.

01:16:28.079 --> 01:16:29.944
I'm not joking here.

01:16:29.946 --> 01:16:31.312
Back the fuck off.

01:16:31.314 --> 01:16:33.078
Oh, I know how to deal
with your type.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.978
Pretty, athletic, popular.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:38.212
But then you did move home to
sling cocktails at casinos...

01:16:38.214 --> 01:16:39.346
They're children!

01:16:39.348 --> 01:16:41.112
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:16:41.114 --> 01:16:43.946
How does it feel to be
on the outside looking in?

01:16:43.948 --> 01:16:46.380
Hurts, huh?

01:16:46.382 --> 01:16:48.881
Well, I can assure you

01:16:48.883 --> 01:16:52.248
that the view from the center
is amazing.

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:53.982
You need help.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.382
Sounds like someone's
a little jealous.

01:16:56.384 --> 01:16:59.082
A little jealous of Sue Ann!

01:16:59.084 --> 01:17:01.417
Think I thought we had
some kind of a connection,

01:17:01.419 --> 01:17:03.150
but you just threw it all away.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:04.283
You threw it all away!

01:17:04.285 --> 01:17:06.884
Ungrateful bitch.

01:17:06.886 --> 01:17:08.852
To think I took care
of Mercedes for you.

01:17:24.089 --> 01:17:26.087
Maggie,

01:17:26.089 --> 01:17:28.020
you're missing out.

01:17:28.022 --> 01:17:29.921
And look.

01:17:29.923 --> 01:17:33.355
- Oh, look who I found.
- Are you fucking kidding?

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.223
He's mine now.

01:17:37.224 --> 01:17:39.156
Thanks for these earrings.

01:17:39.158 --> 01:17:40.423
No.

01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:09.094
I don't know what Ma's deal is.

01:18:09.096 --> 01:18:10.530
Yeah, she's weird, man.

01:18:17.064 --> 01:18:18.496
Fuck it, birthday.

01:18:21.098 --> 01:18:23.163
You fucking liar.

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.963
You said you weren't gonna
hang out here anymore.

01:18:24.965 --> 01:18:26.364
It's Chaz's birthday.
What the fuck?

01:18:26.366 --> 01:18:27.364
- So?
- I didn't have a choice!

01:18:27.366 --> 01:18:29.230
And if I told you,
you would've been pissed.

01:18:29.232 --> 01:18:30.332
- Thought you don't drink.
- Ma's getting everyone

01:18:30.334 --> 01:18:31.432
out of here, okay?
She just wants

01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:33.231
- to hang out with the original crew, okay?
- Right.

01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:35.231
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, my God! Maggie!

01:18:35.233 --> 01:18:36.965
- God.
- I'm so happy you're here!

01:18:36.967 --> 01:18:39.232
God, you're so beautiful.

01:18:42.202 --> 01:18:43.200
What the fuck?

01:18:43.202 --> 01:18:45.467
You should drink
some of the punch

01:18:45.469 --> 01:18:47.133
that Ma made
for Chaz's birthday,

01:18:47.135 --> 01:18:49.101
'cause it is so good.

01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:55.069
No. No!

01:18:55.071 --> 01:18:56.968
Ah!

01:18:56.970 --> 01:18:59.236
Okay, time for bed.

01:18:59.238 --> 01:19:01.971
- Wait, it's almost over.
- I said turn it off.

01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:07.106
Open your mouth.

01:19:20.342 --> 01:19:22.906
I hear all those people
downstairs.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:24.474
I always do.

01:19:24.476 --> 01:19:27.973
Good night.
Mommy loves you.

01:19:45.245 --> 01:19:47.043
Shit.

01:19:50.946 --> 01:19:52.445
Come on!

01:19:55.681 --> 01:19:57.978
Hey. Hey.

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.246
No, I know, I know. But I need
you to stay awake, okay?

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.518
Fuck.

01:20:41.922 --> 01:20:43.454
Help, please.

01:20:43.456 --> 01:20:45.222
Genie?

01:20:54.124 --> 01:20:56.458
Help me. I'm in here.

01:20:57.924 --> 01:20:59.925
Genie?

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:05.125
Genie?

01:21:11.461 --> 01:21:13.127
Oh, my God.

01:21:39.231 --> 01:21:40.929
Mags!

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:49.966
I can feel those big doe eyes
watching me.

01:21:55.134 --> 01:21:58.466
Maggie, you are something else.

01:21:58.468 --> 01:22:00.367
That much diazepam
can knock out

01:22:00.369 --> 01:22:02.933
a Great Dane for five hours.

01:22:04.135 --> 01:22:06.101
<i>Mags, come on!</i>

01:22:06.103 --> 01:22:09.134
It's my day off.
We're doing this.

01:22:09.136 --> 01:22:10.269
You know...

01:22:12.371 --> 01:22:15.068
...some people
just fit right in.

01:22:18.171 --> 01:22:22.103
It comes effortlessly.

01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:24.037
Those perfect little touches.

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.272
Perfect skin.

01:22:28.005 --> 01:22:31.374
Oh, that perfect skin.

01:22:32.407 --> 01:22:34.407
Perfect belly.

01:22:37.308 --> 01:22:40.306
Must be nice, Most Handsome.

01:22:43.075 --> 01:22:44.407
Oh!

01:22:47.076 --> 01:22:48.876
Where you going?

01:22:51.243 --> 01:22:54.044
Girl, you're pissing me off!

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:06.411
And then Haley, Haley.

01:23:06.413 --> 01:23:10.879
Most Popular,
born with the gift of gab.

01:23:12.547 --> 01:23:15.145
I need a man, huh?

01:23:15.147 --> 01:23:17.115
This ought to shut you up
for once.

01:23:26.383 --> 01:23:28.282
What the...?

01:23:33.484 --> 01:23:36.416
Stu, Maggie's gone.

01:23:36.418 --> 01:23:40.216
Can you ju... can you come over?

01:23:40.218 --> 01:23:42.085
Thank you. Okay.

01:23:56.954 --> 01:23:59.153
You know how hard it is

01:23:59.155 --> 01:24:01.487
to know that everybody's
having fun without you,

01:24:01.489 --> 01:24:05.456
without even considering
that you might want to join in?

01:24:08.123 --> 01:24:11.021
And the hard part...

01:24:11.023 --> 01:24:15.290
is when they can't even see you
standing right beside them.

01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:19.223
I'm sorry, Darrell.

01:24:19.225 --> 01:24:21.458
They've only got room
for one of us.

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:27.157
What the...?

01:24:42.162 --> 01:24:43.460
Ma?

01:24:46.195 --> 01:24:48.728
Darling.

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.261
Ma, are you mad at us?

01:24:50.263 --> 01:24:52.461
Oh.

01:24:52.463 --> 01:24:54.429
Come here.

01:24:54.431 --> 01:24:56.496
Come on, up, up.

01:24:56.498 --> 01:24:59.497
Oh, you're a big boy.

01:25:00.565 --> 01:25:03.497
Mmm, you smell good.

01:25:03.499 --> 01:25:05.231
Just like your daddy.

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:08.032
This feels nice.

01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:11.167
Yeah.

01:25:12.967 --> 01:25:15.065
Like we're the only two people
in the world.

01:25:18.335 --> 01:25:20.168
You know who we are?

01:25:21.268 --> 01:25:23.267
The Cutest Couple.

01:25:23.269 --> 01:25:25.035
We are.

01:25:26.503 --> 01:25:29.237
You're Most Charming, too.

01:25:30.504 --> 01:25:33.168
And...

01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:34.903
I love you.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:57.038
Stop!

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.439
Liar.

01:25:58.441 --> 01:25:59.473
Please!

01:25:59.475 --> 01:26:02.106
Why are you doing this?

01:26:02.108 --> 01:26:05.107
You need help.
You need help.

01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:09.174
Not one fucking sound.

01:26:09.176 --> 01:26:12.375
Not one fucking sound
or I will slit your throat.

01:26:12.377 --> 01:26:13.377
You hear me?

01:26:19.111 --> 01:26:21.309
Sue Ann, how you doing today?

01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:22.576
I'm good.

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:28.244
There are quite a few cups and
bottles in your yard right now

01:26:28.246 --> 01:26:30.178
and, uh, couple cars
on the street

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.044
parked near your driveway.

01:26:32.046 --> 01:26:34.345
Is there anything
you need to share with me?

01:26:34.347 --> 01:26:36.312
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

01:26:36.314 --> 01:26:41.447
Well... must be some sort of
a sorority prank or something.

01:26:41.449 --> 01:26:44.580
I guess I'll have to spend the
whole day picking all that up.

01:26:49.417 --> 01:26:52.049
Who's in this house with you,
Sue Ann?

01:26:54.251 --> 01:26:57.982
Mom, is everything okay?

01:26:57.984 --> 01:27:01.049
My daughter is very sick,

01:27:01.051 --> 01:27:03.016
and right now
you're preventing us

01:27:03.018 --> 01:27:05.384
from getting her
to a doctor's appointment.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.050
I see.

01:27:08.052 --> 01:27:10.050
My apologies, young lady.

01:27:10.052 --> 01:27:11.421
I hope you feel better.

01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.920
Help! Somebody, please!

01:27:20.255 --> 01:27:22.420
I told you to stay in bed.

01:27:22.422 --> 01:27:25.187
You just made me kill this man.

01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:26.387
I did not!

01:27:26.389 --> 01:27:29.054
Now get your ass
out of that chair

01:27:29.056 --> 01:27:30.555
and help me drag him inside.

01:27:39.158 --> 01:27:41.290
Erica, what's going on?
Where are we going?

01:27:41.292 --> 01:27:43.123
I think she's off Highway 18.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:45.457
Okay. We'll find her.

01:27:45.459 --> 01:27:47.460
I hope so.

01:27:51.126 --> 01:27:54.125
Bad girl, Maggie.

01:27:54.127 --> 01:27:56.325
I told you not to make a sound.

01:27:56.327 --> 01:27:58.327
Get up.

01:28:00.162 --> 01:28:03.162
Over here.
We have to set the picture.

01:28:09.329 --> 01:28:11.262
Okay.

01:28:11.264 --> 01:28:14.497
Now go get Chaz
and put him against the couch.

01:28:16.164 --> 01:28:18.363
And if you try
to leave this basement,

01:28:18.365 --> 01:28:20.062
I'll kill all of you.

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.197
Where do you want me?

01:28:26.199 --> 01:28:27.997
Oh, you're not gonna be
in the picture.

01:28:27.999 --> 01:28:29.267
You're gonna take it.

01:28:31.467 --> 01:28:32.534
The button on the front.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:44.267
One more.

01:28:47.069 --> 01:28:50.069
Oh, are you smiling?

01:28:56.471 --> 01:28:58.371
Good girl.

01:29:01.605 --> 01:29:04.003
No, no, no, no, no!

01:29:08.273 --> 01:29:10.337
Ma!

01:29:10.339 --> 01:29:13.138
Ma, he's still moving!

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.138
Ma!

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.207
Ma, help!

01:29:41.012 --> 01:29:42.212
Oh.

01:29:43.245 --> 01:29:44.379
I got you.

01:29:50.447 --> 01:29:52.211
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:29:54.481 --> 01:29:56.546
Andy.

01:29:56.548 --> 01:29:59.046
Breathe. Andy.

01:29:59.048 --> 01:30:01.046
Okay. Breathe.

01:30:01.048 --> 01:30:04.180
Andy. Andy, can you hear me?

01:30:04.182 --> 01:30:06.181
Help! Help!

01:30:06.183 --> 01:30:07.216
Help!

01:30:08.216 --> 01:30:09.347
Help!

01:30:14.217 --> 01:30:16.517
Help!

01:30:24.019 --> 01:30:26.083
Come here.

01:30:26.085 --> 01:30:27.952
- No, leave me alone!
- Genie, shut up!

01:30:29.787 --> 01:30:30.618
Oh, my gosh.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.452
- Oh, my God!
- Maggie!

01:30:32.454 --> 01:30:35.419
Mom! We need
to get Andy, okay? He's...

01:30:35.421 --> 01:30:36.553
- Help me!
- No!

01:30:36.555 --> 01:30:38.252
- Genie!
- Help me!

01:30:38.254 --> 01:30:39.352
She's not gonna help you.

01:30:39.354 --> 01:30:41.086
- No!
- Genie!

01:30:41.088 --> 01:30:42.454
She's really
just like her mother.

01:30:42.456 --> 01:30:43.487
You tell her!

01:30:43.489 --> 01:30:45.787
Tell her how weak you were.

01:30:45.789 --> 01:30:48.555
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay, Sue Ann?

01:30:48.557 --> 01:30:52.121
What happened to you
should have never happened.

01:30:52.123 --> 01:30:54.289
And I-I should have
stopped it, okay?!

01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:56.222
- I should have stopped it!
- But you didn't!

01:30:56.224 --> 01:30:57.957
You didn't!

01:31:00.225 --> 01:31:02.123
You didn't.

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:04.523
- Come on, baby.
- Help me, Maggie! No!

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:07.257
- No, I'm sorry, Sue Ann! Please, I...
- Genie! Genie!

01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:08.591
Sue Ann!

01:31:08.593 --> 01:31:11.091
Time to go to sleep.
Mommy loves you.

01:31:11.093 --> 01:31:15.225
You didn't deserve it, okay?!

01:31:15.227 --> 01:31:18.026
- No. No, no, no.
- Mommy loves you.

01:31:18.028 --> 01:31:19.295
Maggie, no!

01:31:21.628 --> 01:31:23.563
Maggie!

01:31:25.496 --> 01:31:29.096
I am not weak
and I'm not my mother.

01:31:35.565 --> 01:31:39.262
Genie!

01:31:39.264 --> 01:31:41.096
Maggie, come on!

01:31:42.532 --> 01:31:44.399
Oh! Maggie!

01:31:46.365 --> 01:31:49.033
Genie!

01:31:50.033 --> 01:31:51.264
Oh.

01:31:51.266 --> 01:31:53.100
You're okay.
